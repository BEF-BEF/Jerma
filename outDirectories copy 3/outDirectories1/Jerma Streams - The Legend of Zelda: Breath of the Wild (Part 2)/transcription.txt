[5.94s -> 42.86s]  What's up? Good afternoon. Yeah, it's a surprise. Surprise, I'm live today. I know I originally, you know what, if you're a watcher of this stream, what you should do is you should check the sus, right? And then what you should do is come back, come back the next day and check it again. I feel like I've reversed the stream schedule the last three weeks every single week. This is this is like the third or fourth reverse delay.
[42.86s -> 43.70s]  Uh, in a row, check it once an hour more like and the next day and the next day and the next day. All right. Yeah, originally I was going to stream today. A couple days ago we talked. Oh, yeah, I'll be live on Wednesday with more Breath of the Wild. But it's my birthday. Not today. And there may have been some birthday plans. I was like, you know what, maybe I'll just come back on Friday. But birthday plans have shifted. So I'm available.
[79.50s -> 134.02s]  Available today. Not going to be available tomorrow. Tomorrow, the next day. We'll go today. I'm here. I'm ready. Hey, he's available. But yeah, let's play some more Breath of the Wild. Happy birthday. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. Thirty seven. Thirty seven. And I can still do this. I can still do this. You didn't see what I did, but it was cool. My hands moved so fast. It's his bones cracking. I also wanted to play Breath of the Wild.
[134.02s -> 161.57s]  For my birthday. So that's where we are. He's still got it. Yeah, still to this day. Yeah, early, early start today. In mod chat, we have a gameplay thing chat wanted to tell you about.
[162.86s -> 181.90s]  Oh, OK. Yep. Uh huh. The shield surfing. Jump and tap the parry button and you can slide around. OK. I'm all right with backseat tips. I'm not OK with you telling me.
[182.54s -> 202.90s]  Uh, who Ganon is, right? I don't want to know who Ganon is to the last cut scene. You're thirty seven. What the fuck? Dude, I know. I'm sorry that you're big. I'm sorry you're figuring this out now. No, I'm not. I'm not like twenty six. No, I'm thirty seven.
[202.90s -> 256.59s]  Ganon is Ganondorf. You're almost forty. Yeah, whatever. Whatever. I'm closer to fifty. Yeah. Dude, can you please be younger? That's I don't think that that's not how it works. Do you think twenty six is young? No. What do you mean? What? I'm that old now. All I said was I see I started YouTube when I was twenty six. That's what I'm saying. I started YouTube when I was twenty six.
[256.67s -> 257.31s]  Twenty five. Whatever it was. I've never really been doing this for twelve years. Almost. Wow. Twenty six is young. Yeah, it is. Thirty seven is young, too. I'm still a young man. I'm still a young man. I'm not forty yet. You know, I am. I'm fighting until that four zero shows up. You know what I mean? On my thirty ninth birthday. No, the night before my fortieth birthday, I am going to be
[298.66s -> 340.53s]  in a full Super Mario pajama onesie, and I'm going to eat popsicles and like and popcorn and watch fucking TV shows all day. I'm literally going to. And then I'm throwing all those pajamas away when I turn forty. I'm going to have an absolute pajama blowout on the night of my fortieth birthday, and I'm just going to burn them all. And it's going to replace my whole closet, going to replace with suits in life crisis. Thirty nine year old behavior.
[340.77s -> 422.26s]  Yeah, what am I going to do with all of my Super Mario pajamas? Fucking finally a good title. What would be finally a good title? I guess I forgot I played the game, by the way. It's going to take me a few minutes. There it is. Breath of the wild. OK, so the jump is that this is attack. It's you hold buttons. All right, fine. Yeah, I'm still a young man. Yeah, not until forty. People are living longer anyways. You're using you. Why do you still have a mop? Thanks for reminding me.
[422.30s -> 442.56s]  All right. So what was the last thing we did? Check the map. Oh, that's a good idea. All right. So we're going here. This is locked memories. We have to go do.
[442.80s -> 460.10s]  Impa told us that there was some crazy shit going on down here. I can have a birthday hat on because it's not my birthday. You can't read. I can read. Can we see more of your beautiful face?
[463.14s -> 474.01s]  It's here. What do you want me to like pull my skin back? What do you mean? Let's see more. This is I'm in front of you right now.
[485.42s -> 500.21s]  Your head is cropped. It's yeah, but that's what do you mean? Yeah, my head is cropped because that's how it works. That's what a face cam is, guys. You understand the word face cam.
[502.73s -> 517.64s]  It's not body full body cam. It's not all of my upper body and like my face cam. It's a camera for your face to be in the corner. And that's precisely what I'm doing. That's how it's going to stay. Let's go.
[517.96s -> 529.80s]  All right. So I need to go from here to here. I'm excited to play this game. I'm telling you, I'm actually excited about it. Is it fall damage? I would have died. Of course there is. All right. Let's glide.
[531.78s -> 570.99s]  Two headphones in for this. Welcome back to Breath of the Wild. We're going to explore this part of the map. We see your neck. That's an easy way to go across the whole game. This game is potentially hundreds of hours. I'm so excited. Made it with time to spare. Come on.
[572.55s -> 598.50s]  The person is saying help? I'm coming. I want a reward. I'm coming. I want a reward. I'm coming. I want a reward. I'm coming. I can't say it. You know what I mean? I'm coming. I want a reward. I know that's kind of fucked up to say. This person dead? No, you're all right. I saved you.
[606.38s -> 623.07s]  Wait, stop. They never fight fair. They always lurk and wait to ambush us. What a bunch of cowards. Seems like every time I go out hunting for arty truffles, I'm taking my life in my hands. Time to stop floofing around here.
[623.63s -> 658.38s]  Let's get back to the hunt for the hardy truffles. I mean, I don't have a weapon. I'm right behind me. What is she scared? You scared of this? Oh, shit. He's attacking another another citizen. You all right. All right. Let's keep going.
[664.52s -> 695.45s]  Somewhere this way. Yeah. Yeah. What's this town? It's very bright. This is a bright town. Can I go in? Can I just go in? Can I just go in? You can. You can go in buildings in this game.
[702.71s -> 733.61s]  I got to get it out of my system. OK. Make their beds. Dude, you need to keep that shit in. Keep it in. No. Do you want to know what keeping it in means for me? If I had to keep it all in after like an hour, I'd be like this.
[737.04s -> 750.37s]  It would be insane. I would explode. Oh, I can dye my clothing.
[751.37s -> 793.74s]  Now, should I change that? Wait, can I change the Nintendo Switch colors like Xbox? This is worth 20 bucks for me. OK, chain. Choose a color. What? You're wearing clothes that you can't dye. That's unfair. I want to make the shirt green.
[795.71s -> 820.87s]  No, I need different clothes. I'm getting one hit by random enemies. I need armor and shit, right? I'm getting one hit killed by the random goofballs outside. Please be all red. No, it's not worth 20 bucks.
[822.98s -> 844.10s]  Buy armor in this village. How much money do I even have? I only have $37. Why would I have no money? Checking everyone out today, too. The check-in just never stops. Never stay to the Tanpu Inn. No, you're not staying there then. I'm supposed to check out everyone who comes into town.
[845.31s -> 886.29s]  That's weird. Dollars? Sorry. Rupees. My 37 rupees. Sorry, I didn't say what it is. It's whatever bucks. Dollars. Money. How much money do I have? Do I have to say how many rupees do I have? You know what it is. You know what it is. That's like calling everything gold. That's fine. How many gold coins do I have?
[886.81s -> 922.46s]  Grandpa, it's rupees, but you don't turn the game off. Any beauties or suspicious folks? What are you talking about? Go stay at the inn. You're not immersed? Yes, I am. I have so many side quests. I have to get overwhelmed with how many things there are to do.
[922.98s -> 949.63s]  First things first. The most important thing that I want to do right now is go to the shrine because that's what I like. My favorite part. Where is it? This way. It might be underwater. There it is. Out of my fucking way. There it is.
[953.21s -> 985.39s]  Oh, man. Oh, come on, dude. I was about to say something funny. I was going to say something funny. Yeah, it was going to be wicked funny. Oh, it's because I forgot. All right. If I fall off this and drown, I'm going to be very upset. No, I'm good. I glitched it out.
[985.39s -> 1046.45s]  Would I have a breakfast? Yogurt. I had a yogurt. It was good. Was it Greek yogurt? Yes. Shut the fuck up. Yeah, it was. What's wrong? Wait. Oh, I thought I was going to just walk in. It's not goat milk. Greek yogurt is not goat milk. Shut the fuck up. It can be. No, it's not. Greek yogurt is not made from goat cheese. Shut the fuck up.
[1066.30s -> 1123.77s]  I'm not. I'm just kidding. God. God. All right. Where's ball? Greek yogurt is not goat milk. Why did I think I could reach that? It's your fault for distracting me with your goat cheese. OK, I need to eat something before I die in here. Oh, emote only is on. Right. So I don't get spoiled. OK, I've got. What about magnet? I do anything, move anything, throw anything, twist anything. Doesn't look like it. So what about stasis?
[1124.77s -> 1192.14s]  Hey, where's the ball? I think it's over here. Oh, OK. Well, move. Oh, you're not going to gyroscope me right now, right? Will he beat the dungeon before 1 p.m.? Yeah, I of course I will get it. Get it right. Check it out. I'm telling you right now. You should be voting for me to win. Yeah, almost.
[1192.14s -> 1308.78s]  Oh, shit. Wait a minute, can I? I can probably just launch it over there. What time is it? All right. No, I'm going to do it the right way. Oh, you piece of shit. Yeah, there you go. Before 1 p.m. done. What's going on? Oh, wait. I can make this jump now if I tilt it down. Oh, that's just a chest. That's just a treasure chest. I thought that was a button that I thought that was the end of the maze. Oh, my goodness. Right. I have to get it down here. OK, I thought that was a button. I thought I was going to drop a separate ball. I don't know. What time is it?
[1308.94s -> 1365.55s]  I still don't think you should vote against me. I still don't think you should have voted against me because I figured that part out. That's the most important thing to figure out. So watch this. Yeah, I saw. I saw the person. Yeah, I saw it.
[1365.55s -> 1386.39s]  Yeah. You don't think I've read what people say sometimes about me? Somebody told me, well, maybe indirectly. I don't know. I heard that watching me play this was like watching an early human learn how to use tools for the first time. It's kind of rude, I think. Fuck.
[1386.39s -> 1422.30s]  All right. All right. Oh, yeah. How's it for a fucking tool? Huh? Take that early human. Fuck you. God damn it. All right. I got seven minutes. I'm fine. Yeah. What the fuck?
[1422.30s -> 1500.02s]  Oh, my goodness. All right. I got to get it. Let's do it right. What time is it? I got plenty of time. Believers, you win. This doesn't count as you know what I mean? This doesn't count. I already beat it.
[1500.02s -> 1617.21s]  I actually I thought this was a button. Frenic Bow. Cool. Target distant enemies. So it's got long range. Pretty cool. All right. I think I just have to die, right? Yeah. All right. You can take it out of your mode only. I won. Hold on. No, this is OK, right? Yes, it's fine. Am I OK? Oh, yeah. All the all the believers. Yep. Believers win. Believers win. Yep. Believers give them the give them the win. Believers won. Believers win. Very cool. Spirit orb. So cool.
[1617.21s -> 1664.60s]  So cool. All right. So now I'm going to go do the quest. That was annoying. I like watching you discover day one speed run strats. OK. So besides that regular mission, I go into the pond. I'm going to look around the filthy pond. Yes. All right. I'm going to go check out the filthy pond.
[1664.60s -> 1707.46s]  I just take something off. Wait, what did I just take off? Yeah, I want to just be able to know what that is. I was on the map. That's because it's not a stamp. Oh, my God. I'm the buttons. Oh, my God. I just wish A and B were flipped.
[1707.46s -> 1741.51s]  What were this person's any stuff? No stuff in here. There's no stuff. You can't steal anything. So what's the point of having houses you can walk into? I'm just just just in a game play and just purely a game play setting.
[1741.51s -> 1767.78s]  What's the point of having houses if you can't steal like jewels from their chest? You can't sleep in the bed. You can't steal plates off the counter. What the heck? Oh, it's probably one of those. No. Heads up.
[1767.78s -> 1791.16s]  OK, what's down here? Anything cool in the pond? Oh, anything cool in the pond? No. There's got to be something cool near the pond, right?
[1791.16s -> 1825.18s]  Arp. Anything of interest here? It was just a rusty sword. Whoa, wait, something interesting. What is this? Pray? You don't say you can hear my voice. Yes.
[1842.66s -> 1855.47s]  She trapped me in this stone statue long, long ago. Villagers here call me the horn statue and don't even bother to wipe away the bird droppings.
[1855.47s -> 1868.80s]  One would think years upon years of such treatment would have made me mend my ways. Does an audio desync? I'll fix it.
[1868.80s -> 1878.36s]  I've only been biding my time for the moment someone who can hear me appears, someone such as you. But I've said enough. Now then, shall we strike a bargain?
[1878.36s -> 1892.42s]  And stay that way. No further action on your part is required. Wait, that was mine. What? Um, excuse me. What just happened? Um, do I get that back?
[1892.42s -> 1905.97s]  That's not good. Ha ha ha ha. My touch is as subtle as ever. Note how I took that essence from you without leaving a mark. What? That's not fair.
[1905.97s -> 1922.53s]  So wait, this thing just eats hearts? How do I get that back? All right, hold on. This isn't audio desync. Let me fix it. So you're saying when I go one, two, three, one, two, three, there is a delay.
[1922.53s -> 1945.34s]  There is? Okay. Is it on me to the gameplay or is the game audio is desynced? It's not my voice. Okay. The game audio itself is doing it. Hmm. Let me see.
[1945.34s -> 1957.94s]  The game audio has desynced from the game video. That's interesting. That's weird. Uh, let me see if I can fix it. So, okay. Are you? Is it happening late?
[1957.94s -> 1979.53s]  Like what? Do you hear the sound first and then I move it? Or do you hear the sound late? This one guy? Game visual is happening late. Hold on. If I can fix it, I will.
[1979.53s -> 2026.78s]  Let's ready? Check this out. Just check this out. Hold on. How's this? Perfect. So what? The horn statue took one of your containers. Well, what the fuck?
[2026.78s -> 2040.06s]  Give it back. Did you think I deceived you? Parish the thought. I hope that ours will be a long and profitable relationship. So which will it be?
[2040.06s -> 2054.89s]  As I may have mentioned once or twice, I'm a dealer in life and power. I can provide a valuable service to you. I take heart containers or stamina vessels from you and then for a price return whichever of the two you like.
[2055.89s -> 2078.54s]  Oh, it's just if you want to. Okay. So if you want to put more points into stamina, you can. It's a respect. All right. Well, I don't want to do that. In fact, I probably should do heart again.
[2079.54s -> 2097.29s]  Next level up. Okay. Money and life are always one to me. If you're ready to begin, then first you must sell me either type of essence for 100 rupees. And then when you want to buy an essence back, it's 120 rupees.
[2097.29s -> 2110.70s]  Okay. Well, I'm not going to fuck up my build, so we're never going to talk ever again. Good day. Nice to meet you. We will never speak again.
[2112.83s -> 2145.46s]  Idiot fucking morning. All right. That's cool. That was that's what was over here. I'm going to mark this. We mark it as I don't know what's like a good point of interest. This should be I don't know.
[2145.46s -> 2161.45s]  This is going to be but this means boss right skull to me is bad boss, not NPC. Maybe this like, oh, it's a leaf star. Maybe a star is probably a good idea. Yeah, that's a good one.
[2161.45s -> 2192.98s]  Okay, cool. Got that. What else is there to look at? I think I can just go do the quest, right? Are they quests in this game or are they missions? Are they quests? Go get a quest? Was it a objective mission? What's it called?
[2192.98s -> 2216.37s]  All right, I'm going to sell some. Maybe I can get some new armor. Oh, look at this. 250. Yeah, I want I want armor armor. Yeah. How much is this total? 180 250. That's 350 like 400.
[2216.37s -> 2227.80s]  Five. I like I was going to drop 700 dollars on the table and just walk away with this. I'm just going to go. I don't I'm not doing math. Just just keep it and leave. Well, I wouldn't have to do the math. They would.
[2230.77s -> 2288.30s]  Whoops. All right. So who do I sell to? Why do you look like John from Garfield? What can I actually sell? I don't really have much to sell. Do you like food? Whoa, look at this is worth a lot. All my my gourmet dishes will get a lot of money. I'm just gonna sell everything. Oh, and I can. Sorry about those sapphires.
[2288.30s -> 2361.73s]  Nobody knows what that is. Maybe one person doesn't. That's all I care about. Is it literally all I care about? All right. What about the amber? I'm going to sell some of these fish too. Who cares? Sell all. You're going to find tons of it anyways. Tons of amber. Are you sure? Sell all the gems. You're never going to use them. Really? I feel like that was a mistake. OK, sell it all. No, I don't. I'm not selling it all. I want this armor. There it is. Got it. I want the whole set. 200. Thank you.
[2364.18s -> 2428.70s]  Please. I'm begging you. Sort your items there. They're exactly where I want them. Wait, I don't think I want this because this helmet is good, right? This is a climbing helmet. Yeah, I'm not. I'm keeping this. I have the Nintendo Switch shirt underneath it. No, you look like a dork. No, I don't. All right. I finally have armor. Does this weigh? Does it weight in the game? Do I have to worry about? Oh, you're going to be fat rolling or something. Die the armor now. Oh, cool dad. That'd be cool. There's no way. OK. Was the person that was dying stuff?
[2428.70s -> 2464.08s]  There you are. All right. Right in front of me. To the right. Oh, dude. Oh, sick goat milk. No. All right. So what can I do? Let's die. Would you like to get back to square one? What do you mean square one?
[2464.08s -> 2510.88s]  Shouldn't I be Link? I can pretend I have the Switch shirt on or anything. Didn't they make a Legend of Zelda game where there were four links and they were each different? One was pink. One was green. One was blue.
[2510.88s -> 2530.50s]  And it was kind of like a movie with all the emotions with the mad one. What was it called? Inside, right? The Four Swords. OK, so who was like the funny, goofy, like goofy one, right?
[2530.50s -> 2544.48s]  Because I want one of them was like sleepy. One of them was like grumpy. Which one of the links was the funny, goofy one? Is that Mike?
[2544.48s -> 2557.80s]  Is this not happening in the Four Swords? Wasn't it like, oh, one was like a sleepy one. One was grumpy. One was kind of like I'm thinking of the seven dwarves. But they did that, didn't they?
[2557.80s -> 2583.61s]  That's not a thing in Four Swords. They didn't do like a red is angry. Blue is tired. Yellow is crazy or kooky. They didn't do that. That's Hyrule Warriors.
[2583.61s -> 2608.01s]  Somebody said, dude, you're thinking of parody animations. What? All right, well, I'm going to be light blue. Wait, five ingredients.
[2608.01s -> 2630.45s]  Have you ever done a sober stream? I was thinking about it. Is it worth? Are these things worth it? I feel like I need these. I don't care. Whatever.
[2630.45s -> 2646.82s]  I'm thinking of Zelda, the Four Swords adventures on the GameCube. No, somebody said it's real. No, wait, we're talking about the mod chat.
[2646.82s -> 2666.61s]  The mod chat saying you guys are on crack. It's real. It's in the Four Swords. The game is real, but I don't think they have personalities like that, did they?
[2666.61s -> 2679.66s]  They were depicted as acting differently. Yeah, one of them was sleepy. One of them was hungry.
[2680.66s -> 2701.67s]  One of them was dashing and one of them was vixen and whatever it was. The manga had flat out different personalities. Red was shy.
[2701.67s -> 2722.63s]  Purple was a cool guy. I told you I knew it. Why are you talking about the reindeer? I knew I did. I knew I had this right.
[2722.63s -> 2743.34s]  What happened to the quest that was here? Oh, I switched it. Okay. All right, let's see. I want to do Treasure Twilight Relic.
[2743.34s -> 2758.19s]  That seems kind of fun. Strange mask. What does EX mean? Ancient horse. Oh, this is DLC. Oh, all the side quest DLC.
[2758.19s -> 2780.48s]  Destroy Ganon. Free the Divine Beast. There are four. The Divine Beast. Okay. Yeah, this one here. I look cool now.
[2780.48s -> 2825.90s]  The game came out in 2004. I knew I wasn't crazy. Where's your horse? I don't use the horse in this game. It's too hard to control.
[2825.90s -> 2842.52s]  You need a better horse. I'll find one. I need to level up. How far away is this? This is not that far. There's a purple cow.
[2842.52s -> 2851.69s]  Wait, they'll all pay. What do you want? Don't act so clueless. Although fine, you seem harmless enough. Forgive me.
[2851.69s -> 2857.69s]  I've just been on edge with all these monsters running around. They come up from Hateno Beach to steal my sheep.
[2857.69s -> 2870.34s]  If someone doesn't do something, I won't have any left. Let's go do that right now. It's right here. That's far away. No, too far. That's too far.
[2870.34s -> 2896.70s]  That's way too far. That's way too far away. No, no, I'm not doing that. It's not too far if you had a horse. I'll get to the horse later.
[2897.70s -> 2926.59s]  That's a two-second walk. Can I actually make this without... I think I can, yeah. The map is not that big. It seems like it's pretty big.
[2926.59s -> 2955.99s]  I think I'm just gonna make it. There we go. Okay, you are all the way out here. You are all the way out here.
[2955.99s -> 2970.18s]  What do these Minecraft signs say? Ancient tech lab. Enter at your own risk. It's bigger than Skyrim?
[2970.18s -> 2977.83s]  I don't really know the scale of Skyrim because I don't really like it. All right, here we go.
[2977.83s -> 2996.82s]  If the flame is blue, the furnace is hot. Don't touch it. Good morning. This is Hateno Ancient Tech Lab.
[2996.82s -> 3004.31s]  Do you have some business with the director? Yes, I do. The director's in the back. Terribly busy person, that one. Please try to keep it brief.
[3004.31s -> 3018.01s]  Good morning. I imagine you've never seen so many books in one place. Pretty incredible, isn't it? I mean, it's actually not that many.
[3018.01s -> 3024.66s]  We've gathered all of Hyrule's known literature on ancient civilizations here.
[3024.66s -> 3031.80s]  So the actual number of books, well, is that the thing on your waist? Is that a Sheikah?
[3031.80s -> 3036.42s]  There's no mistaking it. That's a real Sheikah Slate, isn't it? Never actually seen one in person.
[3036.42s -> 3047.19s]  If you could just show me the runes on it, I'd be most appreciative. Stasis, Magnesis, the remote bomb, and Rionis.
[3047.19s -> 3055.06s]  And what else? Let's see. Oh, that's it. But, hmm, strange. Doesn't seem like you have the basic runes.
[3055.06s -> 3061.00s]  Why are they not there? Oh, where are my manners? I nearly forgot to introduce myself.
[3061.00s -> 3070.66s]  My name is Simon. You are Link, right? You know my name. Lady Impa caught me up to speed.
[3070.66s -> 3075.10s]  You see, we were told a young man holding a Sheikah Slate will appear and you must do all you can to help.
[3075.10s -> 3081.17s]  You'll be the hope that awakens from the slumber of restoration. His name will be Link. What's your name?
[3081.17s -> 3095.42s]  It's not my name. My name's Fred. Director, listen. Ms. Director, this is the real Sheikah Slate.
[3095.42s -> 3104.10s]  No, that's right. I haven't introduced our director. Ms. Pura happens to be right over there.
[3104.10s -> 3111.37s]  Ms. Pura is the world's foremost authority on ancient Hyrule culture.
[3111.37s -> 3121.34s]  Wait, that was... Okay. Check it. I have the utmost respect for Ms. Pura and all she's accomplished.
[3121.34s -> 3126.34s]  I'm honored to be her assistant. On that note, Link, you see the director may look like a young girl,
[3126.34s -> 3131.58s]  but, well, maybe it's not my place to be telling you these things. You should talk to Ms. Pura herself.
[3134.61s -> 3144.76s]  Don't spill the beans. Do you guys have any money? I'm just looking for money.
[3144.76s -> 3150.92s]  Can I, like, reshuffle the books or whatever? Like, I just want some money.
[3150.92s -> 3156.74s]  The director of this laboratory is not Simon. It's me. Snapity snap.
[3156.74s -> 3159.49s]  Anyway, Linky.
[3172.90s -> 3174.90s]  Well, no matter. I'm just happy you're still in one piece.
[3176.14s -> 3179.27s]  What's with that look? You still remember me, right?
[3179.27s -> 3181.96s]  I don't remember.
[3197.06s -> 3198.69s]  Don't, sorry.
[3210.12s -> 3212.12s]  It's a charming quirk, isn't it?
[3233.55s -> 3237.86s]  I'm not gonna go read it. I don't care.
[3243.30s -> 3246.06s]  Anyway, enough about that. Back to the topic at hand.
[3247.06s -> 3254.24s]  After a hundred years, here you are. Here to defeat Calamity Ganon, who is growing in strength with every passing moment.
[3256.44s -> 3262.77s]  And to rescue our beloved princess, Zelda, that is, if you've got the courage to try.
[3262.77s -> 3269.01s]  And to help the one true hero, I, the one and only Pura, will restore the basic functions missing from the Sheikah Slate.
[3269.01s -> 3273.60s]  So, cool. Do it.
[3273.60s -> 3276.60s]  I knew you were gonna say that. Alright, then. First, I need you to run an errand for me.
[3276.60s -> 3280.67s]  What's that look on your face? Well, I'm fine. That's actually what I came here to do.
[3280.67s -> 3286.01s]  I did not. You're pretty considerate.
[3286.01s -> 3289.18s]  But then I suppose that's because you're actually over a hundred years old.
[3289.18s -> 3291.81s]  Let me explain what this errand entails.
[3291.81s -> 3297.48s]  You know, the unlit furnace on the wall just outside this laboratory.
[3297.48s -> 3302.72s]  Could you please bring the blue flame from the ancient furnace in town?
[3302.72s -> 3305.02s]  Oh, and also use it to light our furnace.
[3305.02s -> 3311.81s]  I thought I said don't touch it.
[3311.81s -> 3315.81s]  This sweet little guidance stone will start working once you do that, allowing us to restore your missing runes.
[3315.81s -> 3322.36s]  Okay. Okay, then. I'm counting on you for that.
[3322.36s -> 3326.93s]  Alright, let's go get it. I'm going right now.
[3326.93s -> 3328.93s]  I'm gonna go as fast as I fucking possibly can.
[3328.93s -> 3333.74s]  Alright. If I ain't back in 30 minutes, it's free.
[3333.74s -> 3350.77s]  You can get a motorcycle?
[3350.77s -> 3376.62s]  I'm just finding the urge so much to just go like...
[3376.62s -> 3380.18s]  Let's do a really loud annoying sheep sound.
[3380.18s -> 3383.06s]  It was eating me inside.
[3383.06s -> 3388.16s]  You know, I've done that once before.
[3388.16s -> 3393.16s]  I don't know. I hope I'm not, like, putting in fake memories.
[3393.16s -> 3396.16s]  But didn't I do that on stream once?
[3396.16s -> 3399.59s]  And people flipped out. People were pissed.
[3399.59s -> 3401.59s]  People were like, don't fucking do that again.
[3401.59s -> 3403.59s]  Like, that was not funny. It actually was annoying.
[3403.59s -> 3405.59s]  I swear to God that happened.
[3405.59s -> 3410.33s]  How do I pick it up?
[3410.33s -> 3431.37s]  Alright, I got it. Does this count?
[3431.37s -> 3437.90s]  Make it a SBA torch?
[3437.90s -> 3442.10s]  I don't think I even have a torch.
[3442.10s -> 3448.82s]  Oh, I do. Okay.
[3448.82s -> 3452.41s]  Wait. This thing?
[3452.41s -> 3458.10s]  Oh, this is gonna be annoying.
[3458.10s -> 3463.22s]  It's gonna be worth it.
[3463.22s -> 3471.70s]  Just run. If I can't sprint, it blows out if I sprint.
[3471.70s -> 3475.48s]  God damn it. Hold it up, man.
[3475.48s -> 3477.48s]  I could have done that.
[3477.48s -> 3479.48s]  I could have held that up.
[3479.48s -> 3488.48s]  It's two feet of water, man.
[3488.48s -> 3491.62s]  I have a better idea.
[3491.62s -> 3504.74s]  Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
[3504.74s -> 3508.10s]  What's the next one?
[3508.10s -> 3510.10s]  Is there one up there?
[3510.10s -> 3514.49s]  Is that one all the way up there?
[3514.49s -> 3529.64s]  What's the next one?
[3529.64s -> 3531.64s]  Just go find it. Alright.
[3531.64s -> 3541.93s]  How long does this last?
[3541.93s -> 3564.90s]  Oh, I see one right there.
[3564.90s -> 3565.90s]  What's going on?
[3565.90s -> 3569.04s]  What the fuck is happening?
[3569.04s -> 3571.04s]  What is happening? Why is this fire?
[3571.04s -> 3573.04s]  Why am I on fire?
[3573.04s -> 3584.30s]  What?
[3584.30s -> 3624.82s]  Okay, I need to just walk with it.
[3624.82s -> 3626.82s]  I'm just walking.
[3626.82s -> 3628.82s]  Put the bow away. I'm just walking.
[3628.82s -> 3630.82s]  Just walk with the torch.
[3630.82s -> 3632.82s]  Is this gonna blow out?
[3632.82s -> 3634.82s]  Does this blow out
[3634.82s -> 3636.82s]  if I run all the way up there? It's gonna be annoying.
[3636.82s -> 3648.63s]  Everyone's gonna laugh at me, but I'm losing my mind.
[3648.63s -> 3650.63s]  If anybody laughs at me for this,
[3650.63s -> 3652.63s]  I'm gonna ban you from my community.
[3652.63s -> 3655.77s]  Okay?
[3655.77s -> 3657.77s]  You're gonna get banned from my community if you don't.
[3657.77s -> 3658.77s]  I don't know.
[3658.77s -> 3665.66s]  Look, I redid it.
[3665.66s -> 3667.66s]  What a strangely colored fire.
[3667.66s -> 3681.87s]  It's almost like an anglerfish's lure.
[3681.87s -> 3686.53s]  Okay. Alright.
[3686.53s -> 3690.62s]  I'm back. No, I'm not.
[3690.62s -> 3698.05s]  Wait, where the hell am I going?
[3698.05s -> 3702.21s]  Wait, I gotta go so far?
[3702.21s -> 3705.54s]  Oh my god, I have to go all the fucking way up.
[3705.54s -> 3711.04s]  What do you mean, wrong way?
[3711.04s -> 3713.04s]  Oh my god, this is gonna be annoying.
[3713.04s -> 3717.84s]  There's no weird glitch that I can go like,
[3717.84s -> 3720.84s]  like, sk-sk-sket-sket-sket
[3720.84s -> 3722.84s]  grrrrrrrrrrrr
[3722.84s -> 3724.84s]  and fly like 100 miles per hour that way.
[3724.84s -> 3730.14s]  I actually have to walk.
[3730.14s -> 3736.79s]  I have to walk?
[3736.79s -> 3740.31s]  There is, but you're not skilled enough.
[3740.31s -> 3745.62s]  Wow, that's too bad.
[3745.62s -> 3752.73s]  It's not that far, it's fine.
[3752.73s -> 3765.21s]  I actually might not make this.
[3765.21s -> 3770.78s]  Don't go out, don't go out, don't go out.
[3770.78s -> 3772.78s]  Don't blow out, don't do it.
[3772.78s -> 3787.24s]  Yes, we're good.
[3787.24s -> 3790.25s]  Okay. Now, you want me to light right here?
[3791.23s -> 3801.86s]  Travel gate. Oh cool. All right, so now you're gonna give me my runes
[3803.21s -> 3809.19s]  How do you feel about pride spam? I've never had it. I was like, I've never eaten it. Okay, take a look over there
[3809.79s -> 3811.71s]  There we go
[3811.71s -> 3817.68s]  Cool. Cool. So what does this do?
[3819.09s -> 3839.14s]  Basic runes. What'd I say? I said nah to what? Oh, I thought it was okay
[3839.46s -> 3853.53s]  Give me a I didn't I just wanted to say nah, I wanted to do it. I just turned around
[3853.53s -> 3855.53s]  I was just gonna put the thing in there

[3949.68s -> 3997.19s]  Okay, no, no delete that. Oh my god. I hate this. All right, this is funny. Okay picture save an album. Sure
[3997.35s -> 4008.86s]  All right, that's gonna I that's gonna actually be fun. That's the most expressive link has ever been in a game
[4009.02s -> 4031.48s]  Okay, let me see. Hmm. Who's this beautiful young creature? I'm deleting that immediately. I guess that's my cue
[4031.80s -> 4033.80s]  Sorry, I kind of lost it there. I wasn't on purpose
[4035.60s -> 4039.76s]  Hmm, and it's not just a pretty girl in these images. These are also some old landscape photos
[4039.76s -> 4050.77s]  So when somebody else's camera, I knew Princess Zelda had made frequent use of the camera feature what I have somebody else's photos
[4051.33s -> 4066.66s]  Wait, what it's a hand-me-down phone. They're your old photos
[4067.10s -> 4075.76s]  Okay, check in with Impa. She knows more about Princess Zelda than I ever did. Oh, yeah
[4075.76s -> 4077.20s]  There's just one more thing I need from you
[4077.20s -> 4079.40s]  You don't have to worry about this until after you see info
[4079.40s -> 4081.92s]  But I want you to bring me back some ancient materials
[4082.48s -> 4090.95s]  Bring them to either me or to Robbie. Okay ancient materials

[4152.13s -> 4176.32s]  So this is the what the person took. Okay, what is this a picture of?
[4176.56s -> 4190.01s]  Is this the same tree five times? Well, you went to Disney on a slow day
[4190.01s -> 4204.06s]  Holy shit, how the no people in these photos can you imagine getting a shot like this at Disney? Damn. All right

[4286.06s -> 4306.86s]  I you can't turn how many photos am I allowed to have on my camera? By the way, I get rid of this shit
[4306.86s -> 4326.72s]  I only have 48 photos. Why would I keep just shitty photos? They have to be I want to be good
[4326.72s -> 4345.18s]  This is a little strange, but whatever I don't think I should be able to run up this mountain

[4438.98s -> 4441.96s]  Just the way that world works. I can hear it. I can sense it
[4442.64s -> 4448.74s]  Two or three thousand people at the same exact time just said the same sentence, so it's been manifested
[4448.74s -> 4460.79s]  I heard it my god. This is actually really far away. Whatever. Oh

[5461.58s -> 5473.96s]  Okay, how am I gonna kill these guys? Oh

[5511.37s -> 5513.29s]  Shit, okay. Hold on
[5513.29s -> 5518.90s]  They're almost dead now. They can't take damage from this really I don't think
[5519.78s -> 5530.40s]  Don't know what I was gonna say. Hope he doesn't get up here. All right eat something. Oh
[5558.32s -> 5610.90s]  Got him got him Knights broadsword only one more one more left. No weapon Andy. No weapon Andy. I win. Thank God. Oh

[5634.23s -> 5639.52s]  This thing's almost broken
[5639.52s -> 5644.52s]  But I want to throw it at somebody so I'm gonna get rid of the this yeah, this thing's a piece of shit
[5644.52s -> 5645.80s]  Why don't I still have this?
[5645.80s -> 5662.27s]  All right, what's in here? This is a pretty tough encounter. That's it. I mean, that's okay
[5662.51s -> 5682.06s]  This is a regular spear. Should I just get rid of the guardian sword? You can hit really fast with a spear
[5682.18s -> 5688.56s]  That's literally one of the best weapons in the whole game. Really? Yeah, I don't need this thing anymore
[5690.12s -> 5705.49s]  So I'm gonna save this for a little bit. I have some pretty good weapons. I need more inventory slots. Yeah, I do
[5705.81s -> 5714.84s]  I really do desperately another one of these
[5715.56s -> 5716.92s]  God
[5716.92s -> 5721.28s]  Get rid of this I guess but this thing's not as good
[5722.98s -> 5724.98s]  1520 just think fast
[5725.10s -> 5727.94s]  This thing's fast. What if I need a fast weapon? These are these are slow
[5728.54s -> 5734.80s]  Yeah, the boomerang is sucks. Get rid of it. All right, I'll get rid of the boomerang
[5741.07s -> 5745.41s]  Okay, it's a boomerang. I forgot. That's cool though. Let me do that one more time
[5752.04s -> 5766.98s]  Cool yeah, these night swords are 26 damage. Have you guys ever thrown a boomerang in real life?
[5767.08s -> 5775.81s]  They actually it's actually kind of hard. They just okay. I have been out in
[5776.53s -> 5778.57s]  In a big open field, right?
[5779.48s -> 5783.92s]  Whipping just throwing a boomerang as hard as I can and this shit just goes straight
[5783.92s -> 5791.47s]  It doesn't come around it doesn't do anything if you throw a boomerang for real every time I've ever thrown one
[5791.47s -> 5795.79s]  It just kind of goes there and falls down. It doesn't go all the way around
[5796.19s -> 5801.32s]  I feel like it'd be terrifying. Can you imagine that coming back?
[5804.76s -> 5808.62s]  How do you prepare for that it's just like oh shit, it's gonna hit me in the head
[5808.98s -> 5816.66s]  How do you catch a boomerang? It's just did did did did did did did it's gonna literally get you in the head
[5816.66s -> 5822.04s]  It's gonna kill you. You got to throw it, right?
[5822.04s -> 5830.95s]  I would imagine throwing that and you just see it but hit man briefcase glitching back towards you. No, dude
[5830.95s -> 5833.31s]  I'm turning around I'm sprinting. I'm not gonna get hit by that
[5833.71s -> 5837.51s]  That's terrifying. No way
[5838.19s -> 5845.66s]  Okay. All right the beach
[5845.70s -> 5858.80s]  Wait, did I pick up the sword? Look at that 26 26 26. I got a lot of damage now. I'll go. Let's go with this
[5858.80s -> 5869.09s]  It's the worst one. Oh, there's a shrine. I forgot about the shrine. You're right with it. It's up all the way up, right?
[5869.09s -> 5876.22s]  Yep, they really do come back if you throw them, right? It's scary. Yeah, I don't want to do that
[5876.96s -> 5917.80s]  Yeah, can you do anything with the bull? You can ride the bull. No, you can't
[5923.37s -> 5930.28s]  Well, it's gone. Why are you tan? I don't think I'm tan
[5930.84s -> 5935.87s]  I'm not tan. You can ride anything. That's awesome
[5942.07s -> 5944.95s]  All right. I finally made it
[5945.07s -> 5948.75s]  We're doing that shrine then we're doing that shrine and then I'll go do the main quest
[5949.35s -> 5959.21s]  There's shrine over there. You saw that right over there
[5981.37s -> 5983.37s]  Yeah, I don't get it. It's okay
[5983.49s -> 5987.39s]  It's gonna do this and then it's gonna remember this is how it works
[5987.39s -> 5992.23s]  It does this for like 30 40 minutes and then doesn't happen again for the rest of the day
[5992.43s -> 5998.05s]  Just happen. I don't get it. It was just weird doesn't matter if it's 2 o'clock in the afternoon noon 10 o'clock at night
[5998.67s -> 6020.95s]  Just the way it is. What's on your right? Why do you keep looking on your right?
[6021.57s -> 6023.57s]  Okay on my right I have
[6023.89s -> 6028.21s]  So I have thing that tells me how many frames I drop right there on this monitor
[6028.21s -> 6032.81s]  I have mod chat and then I also have the stream preview is up that way
[6032.81s -> 6037.03s]  So like well not the stream preview but the device that's I'm streaming with
[6037.29s -> 6041.90s]  So I'm usually look from look if you see me looking over here. I'm looking at what's the stream health or?
[6042.74s -> 6047.06s]  Mod chat if I'm looking over here. I'm reading you your chat
[6047.06s -> 6066.04s]  Um, you know, I got a whole battle station here. Okay, so let's go. What's this puzzle?
[6071.39s -> 6073.39s]  computer police play celery man
[6073.67s -> 6076.49s]  Did you do that? Yeah, dude, it ends the same music
[6080.59s -> 6090.25s]  This thing is broken already
[6097.18s -> 6104.95s]  So this doesn't fucking hurt no, don't take a picture
[6108.29s -> 6122.52s]  I'm dead instantly. Okay, I gotta probably parry it. It's a parry, right? It's definitely a parry. It's a boom
[6123.06s -> 6136.44s]  So parry is how do you do parry? You have to be I have the shield equipped
[6136.48s -> 6144.72s]  How do I put this in? How do I put okay, and then it's this in r1
[6145.24s -> 6161.24s]  Listen, how do you how do you parry? I have a shield out and is it how do you parry computer?
[6161.24s -> 6169.40s]  Please should play please place a celery man, please. Hey
[6172.08s -> 6179.03s]  Oh
[6179.27s -> 6203.40s]  You broke my shit
[6235.13s -> 6239.23s]  Barely hurting this thing
[6264.45s -> 6295.23s]  Can you I can't parry that I just have to fight this is not worth it to be honest
[6302.32s -> 6307.12s]  Okay, so when it goes like
[6312.08s -> 6318.85s]  You're gonna I dodged it you saw me jump in the air I fucking dodged that I actually did
[6332.62s -> 6334.62s]  Everything is breaking against this person
[6348.99s -> 6361.98s]  Flurry rush incoming
[6367.58s -> 6369.58s]  Do that didn't fucking even hurt him
[6371.97s -> 6378.96s]  I'm just breaking all my weapons on this
[6379.84s -> 6385.65s]  This is actually terrible. I'm gonna break all my weapons. Everything's gonna break
[6386.83s -> 6391.61s]  Every weapon I'm gonna I all this cool stuff
[6392.25s -> 6404.76s]  Use the best weapons. I feel like as if this is bad
[6433.56s -> 6435.56s]  I
[6445.98s -> 6448.14s]  Was gonna say what the fuck was that
[6449.42s -> 6456.83s]  Where's my flurry rush? Excuse me. I
[6457.71s -> 6494.40s]  Thought you had to interrupt it. I thought I had to land on top of them to interrupt it
[6498.43s -> 6505.84s]  All right. I got it. We'll be good. I got it. Now. I got it. Now. This is it
[6505.84s -> 6531.16s]  This is the one that usually works your bed and play too much Dark Souls. I pressed our three to lock on
[6531.76s -> 6573.93s]  Flurry rush incoming. Oh my goodness. Oh
[6625.86s -> 6666.30s]  Well, what does this do this is stealth boost jump and open the parachute now don't do it again
[6698.60s -> 6700.60s]  I
[6726.12s -> 6787.18s]  Am not getting one hit killed just eat the gross food and puke. I don't care. Go ahead. Do it again. Do it again
[6787.18s -> 6809.87s]  That's not I you have to be directly on top of this fucking head do it again you piece of crap
[6810.59s -> 6815.98s]  But this is different. Am I safe behind this?
[6816.58s -> 6822.22s]  I'm safe behind this right? They'd know there's no way I'm gonna be I'm gonna lie behind this right my dad
[6830.27s -> 6832.27s]  Shoot it in the face
[6832.31s -> 6856.58s]  Okay, um, do I have any more food? I'm fucked. Just eat the snails dude. I don't understand
[6864.44s -> 6885.24s]  I think I'm dead. I
[6885.44s -> 6908.00s]  Didn't know when he was gonna fire. I didn't know. I didn't know when he was gonna shoot it
[6908.50s -> 6918.99s]  Fuck. Okay. I get it now. It's over this time. You're so bad. It hurts
[6918.99s -> 6923.97s]  I have never fought these things. This is the first time I've fought one of these. Of course
[6923.97s -> 6925.97s]  I don't know what the hell I'm doing
[6925.97s -> 6931.94s]  How am I supposed to know I don't have the knowledge of beating this before
[6931.94s -> 6935.40s]  I don't know if the laser does that
[6935.40s -> 6939.64s]  The knowledge of beating this before I don't know if the laser does
[6943.43s -> 6945.63s]  And I should have flurried right there and you know it
[6967.14s -> 6992.90s]  Why is that not working that was a perfect
[6993.46s -> 7002.24s]  Junk it's backwards not sideways. Wait, you can only do it when it's backwards only a backflip does that I wait only a backflip
[7002.80s -> 7010.75s]  What I thought it was just you if you dodged it either side
[7010.75s -> 7014.32s]  I thought it was like doesn't didn't matter as long as you got a perfect dodge
[7014.76s -> 7016.76s]  It's only on backwards
[7016.96s -> 7022.53s]  With a horizontal attack because there's no iframes
[7023.05s -> 7042.60s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me. All right, so I did I thought it didn't I didn't think it mattered
[7043.36s -> 7049.30s]  I did. All right. I didn't know I thought those iframes
[7096.46s -> 7161.82s]  Okay, I got it holy shit ancient battle axe plus what
[7166.16s -> 7167.76s]  guardian shield plus
[7167.76s -> 7191.12s]  No way. No put this away. I'm never I'm literally never using these until the last boss fight something else in here, too
[7191.52s -> 7233.50s]  Whoa better not be no, I don't want to do that. I want to throw the bow. Let's drop it. This game's fun
[7233.50s -> 7239.07s]  I like it. That was a challenge. It was it took me a minute to figure it out, but I got it
[7239.07s -> 7256.37s]  Um, this is fun. I think that's my second one got a shrine right down here
[7256.37s -> 7279.34s]  By the way shrine down here before I get out of here is something else. I should look up
[7280.06s -> 7289.57s]  Check out up here. It's kind of sits alone on the mountain top here. What is this tonoko island?
[7289.57s -> 7294.23s]  I think that's where I'm going. I
[7294.91s -> 7304.20s]  Think that's actually where I'm going right now. Yeah, it definitely is. Oh, all right
[7306.38s -> 7312.14s]  Hmm. I want that trying
[7341.10s -> 7343.10s]  Saving on stamina
[7343.10s -> 7346.03s]  Oh

[7457.37s -> 7459.68s]  Just do it again. I just have to do it again
[7461.56s -> 7497.84s]  You just you have an extra weapon. That's fine. I'm gonna run out of weapons. I think this is bad
[7506.44s -> 7541.37s]  What if I run out of weapons? Can I hurt don't I just blew up one of the things? Oh my god
[7541.93s -> 7548.52s]  Every button in my brain is remapped to dark souls. Our one is attack our

[7710.97s -> 7746.63s]  I'm not trying to jump backwards. Why does it keep doing that? I swear to god. This is drift
[7746.63s -> 7754.53s]  It's now it's not the drift use the pro controller
[7754.53s -> 7761.85s]  I why I don't want to buy something else and use it because they didn't package the better controller in
[7761.85s -> 7780.34s]  I'm not gonna buy the pro controller for the switch two of them. You're doing a Kubrick's dare every time you play
[7781.44s -> 7787.05s]  Sitting there like this. See if I can beat this guy with the Kubrick's dare. I
[7788.09s -> 7852.25s]  Don't know what that means. Oh god run. It's it is
[7853.25s -> 7869.10s]  What it's broken. It's broken. Oh

[7879.27s -> 7897.19s]  Space to bullshit. What's the face to bullshit? Same thing, but it's a weirder. Oh
[7958.93s -> 7967.70s]  Nice miss you idiot
[8055.87s -> 8064.46s]  I'm so paranoid about missing that
[8079.37s -> 8083.48s]  What was that what happened what the
[8084.20s -> 8093.91s]  Oh
[8093.99s -> 8112.07s]  There we go, oh my god, he's doing that thing

[8289.23s -> 8292.36s]  Very valuable to researchers. Oh
[8293.45s -> 8301.09s]  That's cool. All right. Hold on. Look at that. I got a full set of diamond gear. I got the diamond pickaxe
[8301.09s -> 8321.84s]  I got the diamond sword. I got the diamond hoe even I'm loaded save that core
[8321.84s -> 8329.60s]  Do not cook it don't sell it. Don't eat it. Why would I eat the core you can eat it? Don't cook that
[8329.64s -> 8333.08s]  Don't the mods are I'm getting a lot of mod help here
[8333.08s -> 8349.98s]  I was told do not cook that or sell that okay, you've been eating gears. Ooh
[8357.06s -> 8364.88s]  Really? What's the defense on this? This is good. Oh
[8365.72s -> 8380.92s]  Hell yeah, I got the climbing gear. This is really I can sell this now. All right, cool. That's way better
[8380.92s -> 8383.40s]  It's only one defense less and I get the climbing ability
[8385.31s -> 8406.09s]  I'm gonna call me a shit eater
[8406.33s -> 8417.32s]  Who said that I'm not I'm not gonna I don't know they're in here somewhere if you get the full climbing set you go
[8417.32s -> 8427.37s]  Much faster starting to understand this game now starting to get it. No, I get it. I get it
[8427.37s -> 8436.80s]  I get it these little challenge shrines with with cool items in them. I get it. It's like my favorite part of the game so far
[8437.32s -> 8447.81s]  Who's that?

[11168.98s -> 11170.98s]  I wonder oh arrows. Here we go
[11171.44s -> 11176.16s]  Bomb arrows. All right. I'm gonna buy a shit load of arrows
[11181.46s -> 11183.60s]  All right
[11183.60s -> 11186.00s]  10 bomb arrows i'll take uh, yeah, let's go
[11190.47s -> 11193.67s]  Get sugar milk eggs and wheat will that work?
[11202.56s -> 11211.91s]  Who sells sugar that's rice
[11212.63s -> 11216.34s]  Well, i'm kind of out of money anyways
[11220.55s -> 11222.55s]  Ah, this is a weapon shop
[11225.30s -> 11242.07s]  Oh, no, it's a oh, no, no, no. All right. You need wheat cane sugar goat butter and an apple
[11243.03s -> 11244.47s]  Make apple pie
[11244.47s -> 11251.67s]  First has a quest wasn't I supposed to go to the beach for somebody and I forgot completely
[11259.60s -> 11265.11s]  All right. Should I do that?
[11265.51s -> 11270.50s]  Okay, there's probably a treasure on the mountain
[11271.04s -> 11275.11s]  Mysterious place. All right add it to the list
[11277.44s -> 11279.33s]  Are you reading?
[11279.33s -> 11281.33s]  Um, but i'm sneezing
[11281.97s -> 11296.55s]  And very shortly
[11296.55s -> 11298.71s]  Take one picture of everything
[11299.43s -> 11306.90s]  Is what i'm being told
[11306.90s -> 11308.74s]  Everything like even the grass
[11308.74s -> 11344.16s]  What does it not know why is it still saying question mark?
[11344.80s -> 11402.16s]  Okay, this is donkey over here donkey. Okay. Let me make a uh, you need that. Yes, I do take it
[11402.48s -> 11407.09s]  I'll explain to the villagers you eat your fill. All right. Let me cook some stuff. What do we got?
[11408.12s -> 11410.12s]  I know I have at least a few things to make
[11411.22s -> 11422.93s]  All right snail. Okay steak fish steak
[11423.89s -> 11437.78s]  Milk and eggs steak and fruit steak and apple was pretty good. Right steak and salt. Okay
[11438.50s -> 11452.26s]  steak salt more than one salt milk steak should I do it milk and
[11453.14s -> 11505.24s]  Truffle truffle oil five times salt. That's enough fire. Um, why is it enough? How do I get you need a light?
[11508.84s -> 11516.39s]  Why would there not be any light source or anything over here? You can use flint
[11516.79s -> 11531.33s]  How do I use it strike it with a metallic weapon to generate a spark?
[11536.23s -> 11557.03s]  It has to just be on the ground. Okay steak and a bunch of salt
[11568.79s -> 11580.60s]  Fucking waste of ingredients. Why did somebody tell me to do that? That was such a stupid thing to do
[11581.08s -> 11583.08s]  All right. How about this?
[11584.63s -> 11589.38s]  Cooking this into a meal unlocks the potential of these nutrients. Can I do fish and honey?
[11589.78s -> 11593.46s]  Try just cook them individually
[11593.46s -> 11603.33s]  Should these always be cooked individually don't mix effects. Okay, so but if I go like this with one fish
[11604.39s -> 11606.39s]  It's gonna be one heart
[11607.80s -> 11609.32s]  Or will it be better?
[11609.32s -> 11619.78s]  That's two. Okay. So then two fish would be four hearts, right? And i'll put a mushroom in there. Why not?
[11620.02s -> 11639.33s]  Okay, honey and
[11639.33s -> 11647.35s]  All right. How about this another fish? Okay when it's cooked into a dish it increases your attack power
[11647.43s -> 11660.40s]  So let's do that another mushroom. We can't do two right fish honey and apples
[11660.88s -> 11670.68s]  Will this be good? Don't mix stats. So this is
[11671.70s -> 11679.24s]  Stamina this is also stamina. This is just fine
[11679.80s -> 11686.36s]  It says nuts and then this is
[11687.96s -> 11700.68s]  Attack power so I don't want to do that. Okay defense
[11702.56s -> 11716.79s]  Stamina, so this would be huge. Let's try this. Whoa
[11720.44s -> 11722.12s]  That's cool
[11722.12s -> 11729.00s]  So let's this is stealth. So this is a stealth
[11731.62s -> 11741.80s]  Any more stealth any more stealth food heart recovery?
[11747.03s -> 11758.18s]  Maximum hearts. This is just eggs. I'll put some wheat in there, too
[11767.30s -> 11776.61s]  Stealth boost sneaky fried egg and rice. Maybe let's just make a few of these
[11780.50s -> 11783.33s]  right and then
[11784.42s -> 11815.03s]  Attack power more add salt to and more eggs. I have eggs don't I double salt double wheat
[11819.41s -> 11840.74s]  Add some bacon in it and an apple. Nice. Okay. I'm gonna have a lot of good food
[11841.54s -> 11863.65s]  Okay, egg milk salt wheat fish. This is defense. It's gonna be huge five minutes of defense
[11863.97s -> 11881.89s]  So we said cook an individual truffle make a creamy mushroom risotto. Oh, wow. Holy shit
[11885.35s -> 11896.12s]  Why wouldn't I just only do this? Are you kidding me? That's insane full recovery
[11900.50s -> 11910.93s]  And two spirit hearts. What about this shit grease your heart recovery when you use this as an ingredient
[11911.01s -> 11921.20s]  All right, so let's do two of these some milk an egg and another another glass of milk. Let's have let's make a uh,
[11921.76s -> 11929.25s]  Let's pick up a coconut stew. Wait, hold on
[11929.73s -> 11940.08s]  Let's not put some salt in it. No, no salt. This is gonna be like a cake milk fruit and egg. It's gonna be like a
[11941.04s -> 11942.40s]  stew
[11942.40s -> 11961.60s]  And I made an omelet. Okay, what does this do? All right, whatever. I'll just do this
[11968.39s -> 11976.04s]  Very good. Now i'm ready. Look at all the food I have now. I mean some of the stuff is gross, but that's fine
[11976.12s -> 11980.61s]  I have so much stuff now. Thank god
[11982.79s -> 11984.80s]  Okay
[11984.80s -> 11991.86s]  Now that i'm prepared that way it's time to move to the divine beast
[11992.26s -> 12018.93s]  Press please sort it press y to sort it didn't do anything. Is it by rarity or something? Go level up. Oh
[12019.57s -> 12029.91s]  Do I have four? I think I only have three. What about the beach quest?
[12032.66s -> 12037.89s]  Shit, yeah. All right, i'll do the beach quest fine. I'll do the beach quest
[12038.45s -> 12068.98s]  Let's go preparation is the most important thing in breath of the wild. That's what i've been told
[12071.97s -> 12074.53s]  Packed buffs are great for bosses or tough enemy camps
[12076.16s -> 12083.44s]  Also, you're doing way too much healing for your current hp look smaller dishes. You're not wasting ingredients. Oh, that's right. I didn't think about that
[12089.94s -> 12091.94s]  Yeah, one of those is it heals 10 hearts
[12092.66s -> 12094.66s]  That's a little too much. I think
[12094.90s -> 12099.64s]  Can you see me a lullaby? Yeah, I think so. I think I could give singing a lullaby
[12100.28s -> 12106.39s]  what
[12141.88s -> 12151.44s]  We're floating all the way there that's somebody just said that's the final straw
[12155.38s -> 12159.96s]  What are you talking about?
[12159.96s -> 12162.36s]  Uh-oh, I have not been paying. Oh, I gotta do this
[12166.23s -> 12169.00s]  It worked
[12169.00s -> 12171.00s]  All right, dude, that's the last straw
[12171.16s -> 12176.61s]  Come out of here
[12176.61s -> 12178.29s]  Okay, so let's do it
[12178.29s -> 12184.34s]  I'm ready. I got some good weapons. Maybe I should eat one of the stamina foods
[12207.35s -> 12215.83s]  What are they fighting? Why are you fighting me? What are they doing? I'm trying to save them
[12227.49s -> 12255.22s]  Holy shit that hurt
[12255.22s -> 12289.16s]  Oh my god, your reach is insane. Ooh
[12298.87s -> 12317.17s]  What the fuck enhanced?
[12317.81s -> 12326.58s]  Lizzle spear. Okay. So now what do I got? I gotta get rid of some of this shit
[12330.87s -> 12342.68s]  I'll use it. Spears are really good. This one seems really good. Okay
[12353.08s -> 12373.48s]  I still have so much trouble judging how far this goes. I don't even think about it
[12391.59s -> 12397.17s]  Oh my god, that's fucking such a what a youtuber seriously like honest to god
[12397.89s -> 12399.89s]  Don't fucking die because you're a youtuber
[12423.64s -> 12449.60s]  Got it. Okay
[12449.60s -> 12452.08s]  So now
[12452.08s -> 12453.76s]  I believe
[12453.76s -> 12456.52s]  How do I get them to come back?
[12456.52s -> 12465.33s]  Well, i'll deal with them in a second. Can I like move them?
[12468.76s -> 12479.16s]  Oh nice good bolt fruit again
[12480.58s -> 12499.84s]  Uh-huh grabs. All right. So what do I do with the sheep?
[12515.01s -> 12538.28s]  How do you get the sheep to move something else to do that freaked out? It's okay. Wait this meat
[12539.00s -> 12541.00s]  Oh man meat
[12553.41s -> 12554.69s]  What's the
[12554.69s -> 12566.80s]  Where's the marker going? Wait, did I do it? Did I do it? Did I do it? Oh
[12567.68s -> 12575.78s]  Okay, what's where's this one? That's up here
[12576.71s -> 12578.71s]  All right. I'm gonna go back and turn this all in
[12586.98s -> 12600.44s]  Will you please go back and talk to her?
[12607.08s -> 12608.20s]  Well, that's
[12608.20s -> 12610.20s]  Definitely what I should be doing
[12616.42s -> 12638.50s]  Travel I need a new horse so bad. I need a horse so bad. What's the shirt?
[12639.46s -> 12642.63s]  Andy martin
[12642.63s -> 12643.91s]  Whatever
[12643.91s -> 12647.62s]  Yeah, i'm wearing my whatever shirt
[12648.18s -> 12662.95s]  All right. So what do you what do you need?
[12662.95s -> 12664.95s]  Something good. What what's what am I doing here?
[12666.66s -> 12670.28s]  ancient material
[12670.28s -> 12672.52s]  Three ancient screws to power up your sensor
[12673.60s -> 12675.60s]  ancient shaft power up your remote bombs
[12676.16s -> 12677.68s]  ancient cores
[12677.68s -> 12682.60s]  Oh, man. All right. I have all that stuff
[12687.19s -> 12693.27s]  Yeah, let's do it. Okay
[12695.78s -> 12733.97s]  Definitely remote bomb. I use that all the time. I'm I use bombs all the time a lot. I'm a big bomb
[12734.77s -> 12742.68s]  Um delta bomb fan dude. She installed root on your phone
[12748.95s -> 12760.60s]  Okay
[12760.60s -> 12764.53s]  So what's another good one?
[12764.61s -> 12766.85s]  Um, how many
[12766.93s -> 12770.53s]  Is this what you do with this stuff or is there other things you can do with the ancient materials?
[12776.36s -> 12781.32s]  Stasis or the sensor just do them all if I can there are other things. Okay
[12781.96s -> 12788.42s]  All the stasis I use stasis pretty frequently. I don't have it. Oh
[12791.75s -> 12794.96s]  How about the sensor?
[12794.96s -> 12823.91s]  Yeah, let's do it. Oh talk to the sheep owner. Yeah, i'm just getting this out of the way. This is um
[12825.75s -> 12829.83s]  I like games like this because I feel like I haven't done anything but I feel like i've done a lot
[12831.54s -> 12834.16s]  I feel like I have not done a single thing yet
[12834.16s -> 12847.16s]  But somehow I am okay if your sensor has been augmented to search for things other than shrines
[12847.56s -> 12855.44s]  It reacts when you are close to the thing you have set it to look for so you can make it look for other stuff
[12856.72s -> 12863.48s]  Okay, cool
[12863.48s -> 12867.32s]  You can now search for anything you take a picture of that's why you're taking the photos. Oh
[12874.72s -> 12880.08s]  That's actually really helpful. All right
[12881.73s -> 12883.97s]  The sheikah sensor plus I really want to see it
[12888.37s -> 12900.77s]  Take a look picture of a sun shroom with the camera
[12929.49s -> 12939.09s]  Okay, i'm pressing b
[12939.35s -> 12955.67s]  But it's you have to hit x b is universal back. I did get one. Okay using that in the rain
[12955.75s -> 12957.27s]  Yeah, that's probably a bad idea
[12957.27s -> 12980.79s]  Okay, give me three sun shrooms. So
[12981.43s -> 12983.89s]  All right. So here we are
[12983.89s -> 12994.40s]  The album we're looking for that's these are not pictures of the bow is they're pictures of me
[12994.88s -> 13018.39s]  Okay, so target with sensor searching for sun shrooms. Okay
[13020.84s -> 13024.92s]  So that's gonna blink when i'm near a sun shroom now very interesting
[13035.84s -> 13039.19s]  Yep, the one back here
[13039.19s -> 13040.79s]  sun shroom
[13040.79s -> 13042.79s]  All right. So then now just have to look for him
[13046.07s -> 13049.41s]  Oh
[13049.41s -> 13051.41s]  That's I like that feature a lot. That's cool
[13052.05s -> 13089.60s]  Is there another one over here? Go to that light go to that beam go to that beam. What is it?
[13089.92s -> 13131.01s]  It could be rare now go get it. I thought that was a marker that I put down
[13131.09s -> 13133.09s]  I thought that was one of those beacon things
[13134.24s -> 13136.64s]  When I looked on the map, I was like wait a minute. I didn't put that down
[13143.19s -> 13145.19s]  I have a gold one on the map
[13146.34s -> 13148.34s]  This ends at 5 a.m. Dude, hurry up
[13150.05s -> 13161.68s]  What?
[13161.68s -> 13166.08s]  Lighting is ooh, there's um, was it unobtainium? Whatever it is
[13187.67s -> 13190.61s]  Frank it's not like the uh
[13191.41s -> 13193.41s]  What's the other force from the other games?
[13194.74s -> 13218.50s]  You have to be within the same zone or something. I think frank is dead really
[13219.14s -> 13221.12s]  That would be kind of sad
[13221.12s -> 13235.25s]  All right. So what is this?
[13235.33s -> 13272.24s]  Is it doesn't work?
[13280.92s -> 13286.10s]  Star fragment mysterious stone fragment that fell from the sky looks like it would fetch a good price
[13286.18s -> 13288.10s]  But you may be able to use it in a certain recipe
[13290.16s -> 13293.68s]  All right. Nice
[13293.68s -> 13299.32s]  So now what what do I want to go from here? Probably fast travel back to here. Oh, I need the shrooms, right?
[13299.80s -> 13306.40s]  I wipe this out. I need to go back to the village and I have to talk to
[13307.44s -> 13313.84s]  Yeah, hold on cook it
[13316.93s -> 13324.39s]  What if you cook the star? Do you make a black hole in high rule kingdom and ever get sucked into it?
[13337.57s -> 13339.57s]  Okay, I need to find a couple more shrooms
[13340.05s -> 13345.56s]  apparently a few nearby
[13345.56s -> 13347.56s]  They're probably down here
[13357.70s -> 13372.53s]  Really?
[13372.77s -> 13380.18s]  Where are these mushrooms that what do you mean nearby? They're not nearby
[13417.01s -> 13441.40s]  What the fuck are these things? Oh, hey there
[13444.42s -> 13466.04s]  All right. I got three, right? That's what you needed. I got a lizard iron shroom and a bunch of these too
[13466.44s -> 13499.51s]  Okay, I got a lot of these. I thought this is live. How much is enough of any given material like 10 20
[13503.70s -> 13527.72s]  Finding new objective. It's never enough 25. I think that's good enough to turn this in
[13528.20s -> 13550.29s]  Can you just watch funny videos instead of playing this dude? Can I can just like watch some funny videos?
[13571.17s -> 13584.02s]  Ooh, that was worth it. I think i've got some news that should be music to your ears
[13584.90s -> 13588.18s]  Found a way to help you search for new objects using the sheikah sensor plus
[13589.67s -> 13591.67s]  Uh show excitement
[13591.67s -> 13596.95s]  Okay, I was doing some research. I felt there were some pictures of the past left on the guidance stone
[13597.86s -> 13599.46s]  You add those pictures
[13599.46s -> 13602.10s]  To the compendium you can search where did you went over this?
[13602.66s -> 13606.58s]  Oh
[13606.58s -> 13624.61s]  Didn't we already go over this drop one of those and take a photo. That's a great idea
[13628.85s -> 13637.68s]  What are we doing?
[13637.68s -> 13654.76s]  Doesn't sherman know that he has to eat a bug since he made 10 dark souls references
[13659.44s -> 13661.44s]  That was never set in stone
[13661.76s -> 13664.26s]  I have to eat a bug. What bug?
[13666.10s -> 13668.58s]  When did I I didn't make 10 dark souls references?
[13676.95s -> 13682.21s]  You name me 10 dark souls references and i'll believe you. Okay
[13683.91s -> 13687.56s]  Please be a centipede
[13687.64s -> 13710.45s]  God damn it. No enough. Is this the sus guy? Yeah. Yeah
[13721.84s -> 13723.84s]  I should probably not have these
[13724.16s -> 13735.49s]  mushrooms anymore, right? Although
[13736.21s -> 13737.73s]  Okay, let me do this
[13737.73s -> 13743.92s]  Where's the truffle watch this? So somebody said you could do this
[13747.06s -> 13756.72s]  Truffle now I can find truffles, which that's pretty cool. That's a good idea
[13757.28s -> 13762.87s]  All right. Well, I definitely don't want it to be that so
[13763.68s -> 13794.02s]  Uh, let's do it. How about I change it back to shrines you need to on the map? Okay

[14765.27s -> 14767.59s]  Cool. I need a picture of a rush room. Do I have rush rooms?
[14769.28s -> 14776.13s]  I think I have a picture. Well, not a picture. I think I have one in my inventory
[14777.57s -> 14781.33s]  Don't I?
[14781.33s -> 14788.90s]  Do I have a single rush room? I don't think so
[14797.83s -> 14800.23s]  Where do you get rush rooms?
[14800.23s -> 14803.59s]  I cooked them all. Yeah, but they're on the sides of cliffs, aren't they?
[14804.39s -> 14806.76s]  Usually they stick it out of a cliff
[14806.76s -> 14808.44s]  We can find one right here
[14808.44s -> 14818.39s]  It's the purple ones on the clips. I'll check that after this guy
[14819.35s -> 14826.64s]  Maybe this guy will give me some uh rush room
[14827.12s -> 14838.05s]  Here's the picture
[14838.05s -> 14841.49s]  That's it. It's beautiful, but I thought it would be more sacred and elegant
[14843.64s -> 14856.10s]  How is that not elegant and sacred? Is there a place you've been seeking?
[14860.90s -> 14868.53s]  Oh, I know where that is. All right big mountain east of this way. I know that place
[14868.61s -> 14872.05s]  There's a big mountain east of this village. It's called mount

[14926.44s -> 14928.44s]  Some rush rooms. Let's check the clips
[14929.24s -> 14937.68s]  Because if i'm right here, I might as well try to upgrade this
[14945.40s -> 14950.28s]  No rush rooms
[14950.28s -> 14951.64s]  I don't see any
[14951.64s -> 14960.56s]  Oops, I distinctly remember there was a ton
[14961.36s -> 14965.36s]  Somewhere else. I remember just passing by them and not picking them up. I was like, nah, I don't need them
[14965.92s -> 14974.53s]  Put them on your sensor. I don't have a picture of them. Oh i'm doing that
[14975.73s -> 14987.72s]  Look at this
[14987.72s -> 14989.72s]  It's a great find. Look at all that money

[15053.16s -> 15065.96s]  Yeah, I do
[15065.96s -> 15067.40s]  This thing was better
[15067.40s -> 15081.04s]  Tortures are easy to find. Yeah, they are but I feel like I need one and I don't have one sometimes
[15081.76s -> 15097.28s]  back there
[15097.28s -> 15102.95s]  Okay, is this swamp or can I stand in this?
[15103.67s -> 15116.95s]  Where am I even going? All right. So I do want to go this way. This is kind of the direction I want to be going
[15148.31s -> 15155.72s]  All right trying time. I love the shrines. There's so much fun
[15157.00s -> 15172.64s]  shrine time
[15172.64s -> 15174.32s]  shrine time
[15174.32s -> 15180.96s]  Why do we do that? Has anybody figured that out? Is there a reason why?
[15181.44s -> 15187.28s]  Anytime you stretch or if you're lying in bed or if you're just you have to make this horrible noise
[15188.63s -> 15189.67s]  why
[15189.67s -> 15200.28s]  When I get up in the morning, it doesn't happen every time either. It's just like I don't I don't know why
[15202.15s -> 15205.59s]  It's never been explained
[15205.59s -> 15208.55s]  And you freeze your whole body locks up
[15209.51s -> 15212.52s]  Why do we lock up and scream?
[15212.84s -> 15214.84s]  I'm not the only person that does this right?
[15218.64s -> 15221.60s]  Yeah, when you guys get up in the morning, do you lock up and scream?
[15230.15s -> 15296.08s]  Yes. Yeah, everybody does right that's emote only you can't tell me shit. All right, so that's obviously not what you do climb
[15340.21s -> 15352.76s]  World's most simple task. Okay, cool. Great. Now what?
[15354.55s -> 15430.02s]  Um, all right, so i've got stasis. Okay, check this out. I think I know what to do. What's that?

[15653.76s -> 15656.88s]  That's what you do. You just gotta scoop it up like a reverse claw machine. I know what i'm doing
[15678.21s -> 15702.80s]  Let me know that's what that's exactly what you're supposed to do. I'm just too slow watch this ready

[15980.05s -> 15985.88s]  I'm doing the shrine here and then i'm gonna wrap around here to do the divine beast. That's my plan
[15986.36s -> 15989.04s]  How do you what do you turn in the spirit orbs again? I forget

[16349.72s -> 16353.08s]  Which runs along the north side of that tower to inogo bridge
[16356.96s -> 16358.96s]  I can see it in your eyes. You're asking yourself why
[16360.20s -> 16364.04s]  Reasonable question for a stranger frosted by a passing zora in such a manner
[16364.60s -> 16367.88s]  But I must assure you this venture will be profitable for you as well
[16368.68s -> 16373.00s]  See prince cedan of zora is in desperate search of a strong hylian
[16373.56s -> 16378.04s]  And as a loyal request from the prince himself, it's safe to assume a generous reward is in the cards
[16379.78s -> 16384.88s]  I'm asking you go meet prince cedan at inogo bridge along the zora river just upstream from here
[16389.27s -> 16392.02s]  You're getting robbed
[16392.02s -> 16392.90s]  Okay
[16392.90s -> 16394.02s]  That's fine
[16394.02s -> 16399.81s]  That's not wait. Do I I can I don't have to accept it?
[16403.89s -> 16406.13s]  Or just know that it's there
[16406.27s -> 16430.66s]  zidon
[16430.66s -> 16457.12s]  Uh, not good green nut. Um, do I have to land in here or maybe what do I have to burn it or something?
[16457.68s -> 16462.50s]  Fire right? Yeah, I remember seeing that spoiler from last time. I was live
[16478.24s -> 16480.24s]  That sucks, i'm sorry, man
[16486.16s -> 16489.22s]  Okay, so I need fire
[16489.86s -> 16492.26s]  This fire over there
[16492.26s -> 16494.26s]  Question is can I bring it this way?
[16494.98s -> 16502.10s]  Is this like a giant torch?
[16502.10s -> 16504.10s]  This thing right here
[16504.10s -> 16507.88s]  Oh, I have flint
[16508.36s -> 16545.51s]  Dude, I can stand in this why do you drown in that I can stand up. Hello
[16545.99s -> 16555.56s]  This doesn't work
[16555.56s -> 16583.83s]  What about my arrow? Wait, hold on. Yeah, that doesn't start a fire. Hold on. I'll be right back
[16584.39s -> 16638.80s]  Does this work? You need wood and flint. What the fuck?
[16640.37s -> 16672.76s]  Wood and flint. I almost got no more left. Okay, bro. Your dark uga is showing
[16674.21s -> 16709.38s]  Dark uga this is a bug in my hair. Oh boy. They're done. Are they done?
[16710.37s -> 16740.42s]  They can burn or whatever. This is worse than a regular apple regular apple is better. No, it's not it's not
[16740.58s -> 16751.33s]  I thought it was one heart. No, that's not what I said. I I mean I like regular apples in real life
[16751.41s -> 16768.24s]  I don't like baked apples. I like old apples. You guys misunderstood me. I want more weapons and armor and stuff
[16773.80s -> 16866.28s]  Let's trial speed of light. I got it. Okay now it's only the second. Mm-hmm. Right now that shit floods
[16904.36s -> 16908.07s]  It seems I don't know where to go
[16910.82s -> 16915.11s]  This elevator goes up but this barrel
[16916.23s -> 16918.52s]  Goes down
[16918.52s -> 16922.80s]  Hmm. All right. Um
[16922.96s -> 16952.00s]  It's definitely something out here. What if I block this and do anything?
[16952.56s -> 17010.93s]  What's the point of this?
[17013.16s -> 17043.33s]  Oh, thank god ice cold. Do I have to like fill the barrel with water so it makes sense, right? Make it heavier
[17043.89s -> 17069.54s]  It's not what you do. I probably have to spin this thing back but
[17070.18s -> 17072.93s]  Can I?
[17072.93s -> 17087.67s]  Interesting. Why would I want to do that though?
[17090.72s -> 17109.25s]  Why would I want to stop that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know but let me go over here. Okay, if I go like this
[17134.92s -> 17136.92s]  Oh the water
[17138.93s -> 17165.70s]  Water. Uh-huh. But so I put the water fill the tank with water
[17171.86s -> 17182.16s]  Fill the thing with water. Okay now
[17182.16s -> 17196.16s]  Now
[17205.68s -> 17218.45s]  Okay, so I have to get this plan is to get this back over there
[17219.64s -> 17221.64s]  And then get over there myself
[17222.28s -> 17224.28s]  Freeze time on that thing
[17225.08s -> 17227.78s]  All right. I know what to do
[17227.78s -> 17229.78s]  This could be wrong, but whatever let's try it
[17234.58s -> 17238.45s]  Get this back over there. Okay now
[17239.33s -> 17244.12s]  I'm gonna do this
[17244.60s -> 17249.46s]  What if I do that maybe that's stupid this could be stupid but we'll find out
[17250.42s -> 17259.78s]  I can't freeze time on this. So, all right, I'm gonna freeze time on you
[17261.04s -> 17262.69s]  Spin it
[17262.69s -> 17274.76s]  Go
[17274.76s -> 17315.59s]  All right. Got it. Wasn't that bad. Is this for a spirit orb? Very cool spirit orb
[17319.88s -> 17321.08s]  Five. Yep
[17321.08s -> 17323.08s]  Cool. All right. Now I'm gonna activate the tower
[17324.92s -> 17343.09s]  And oh I have the seeds too, don't I? I got four of those. The time freeze didn't do anything
[17343.41s -> 17346.87s]  You didn't even notice the extra chest
[17350.15s -> 17351.75s]  Yeah, whatever
[17351.75s -> 17374.04s]  There's some unobtanium over here though link. You are an awful swimmer. Give me a break really i'm gonna drown in here
[17377.92s -> 17398.71s]  No, i'm not. Where is it? What a waste. That's such a waste
[17400.47s -> 17402.47s]  Nah, i'll just die. Whatever just die
[17403.11s -> 17404.80s]  Go ahead and die
[17404.80s -> 17437.48s]  Yep, I can't make that i'm gonna jump. I'm just gonna jump from off the shrine
[17438.71s -> 17449.62s]  Go from up here. All right ice functions. You're right. I forgot I had ice
[17449.94s -> 17455.54s]  I keep forgetting you can use this stuff outside of the shrines in my brain. It's a shrine power
[17479.83s -> 17481.83s]  Get the unobtanium and then head over here
[17482.07s -> 17493.64s]  Let's get the shit out of me
[17509.86s -> 17527.68s]  Cool, let's go sledgehammer is damaged. Where do you get? I have not found another sledgehammer. All right, it's broken
[17527.68s -> 17529.68s]  But how do you get another sledgehammer?
[17535.65s -> 17536.53s]  Oh

[17588.55s -> 17599.43s]  I'll buy some sure a hundred dollars
[17602.66s -> 17615.64s]  That'll take your life what you just love when the fucking lock-on turns around and looks at the shrine behind you

[17914.28s -> 17916.28s]  I thought I was safe. I guess
[17916.36s -> 17918.92s]  But no, I was not

[17943.84s -> 17946.24s]  I've been searching for a hylian like you for a very long time
[17947.12s -> 17950.40s]  My home zora's domain is in terrible danger. That's why prince

[18560.20s -> 18565.64s]  It's still raining
[18568.50s -> 18570.50s]  Even with the climbing outfit on

[18721.75s -> 18732.56s]  What was that thing?
[18732.56s -> 18736.12s]  Ice rod waves of freezing air
[18736.76s -> 18743.89s]  Does it break?
[18743.89s -> 18746.71s]  I don't want to put that on
[18746.95s -> 18758.07s]  Holy shit. Okay. This is awesome. Very cool. All right
[18758.87s -> 18764.95s]  Most of the tower

[18776.48s -> 18794.45s]  Damn it bombs will do it in bobs do it too. Cool
[18796.42s -> 18802.45s]  Uh, some lucky person is gonna like find that and get rich and that's fine. I don't care
[18803.33s -> 18820.02s]  interesting
[18823.60s -> 18856.21s]  Press for a moment. Have I given a rating? It's uh,
[18861.38s -> 18868.15s]  Um, I don't know it's definitely a
[18869.94s -> 18874.00s]  it's way higher than an eight because i'm
[18874.72s -> 18877.12s]  Realizing the amount of things you can actually do
[18878.80s -> 18881.97s]  It's very comfy
[18881.97s -> 18883.01s]  Okay
[18883.01s -> 18885.01s]  I know people are gonna be mad that i'm gonna say this
[18885.81s -> 18886.61s]  but
[18886.61s -> 18889.01s]  All right, whatever i'm gonna say
[18889.01s -> 18895.40s]  This is a comfy elden ring. It's not I didn't say easier
[18896.12s -> 18899.43s]  It's not oh, this is like a kid's game. No, no, no
[18899.51s -> 18901.83s]  It's just a comp. It's just a comfier elden ring
[18905.54s -> 18911.14s]  I don't I mean, yeah, maybe i've been a little stressed during some of the encounters but for the most part i'm not
[18911.78s -> 18913.54s]  um
[18913.54s -> 18916.18s]  I'm not stressed the fuck out like I am everywhere in elden ring
[18922.87s -> 18926.23s]  When I die in this I just kind of laugh it off and I just climb the mountain again
[18926.63s -> 18933.04s]  You don't really get penalized for losing like you do in the prom software games, obviously
[18942.61s -> 18945.17s]  Like i'll ski off the mountain and fall down and die
[18945.65s -> 18949.88s]  Because it doesn't matter i'm not gonna lose 50 000 souls or something
[18950.60s -> 18953.56s]  Or forget how I I not even get back to that area again

[19046.29s -> 19057.88s]  That's a saying
[19064.77s -> 19066.69s]  Okay, I just typed it

[19110.52s -> 19112.92s]  Forget everything. Don't forget everything

[19121.40s -> 19124.44s]  Push this guy off you can't there's no there's no collision
[19132.48s -> 19135.76s]  I'm having a little bit of trouble. Is that it's prince syden down here
[19154.79s -> 19163.20s]  Found him say hey there young one up top above you
[19163.68s -> 19174.55s]  What's up syden?
[19174.55s -> 19178.79s]  He's googling pardon the entrance. I I don't have to tell you what I typed in
[19179.03s -> 19183.27s]  I was hoping perhaps you'd have a moment to talk people question marked by use of that phrase
[19184.50s -> 19186.82s]  And I was like, what are you talking about? So I typed it in
[19189.72s -> 19191.88s]  And I just I was like, okay, wait
[19207.32s -> 19209.96s]  What why is it what everybody wanted me to come see syden?
[19215.06s -> 19217.06s]  I am syden the zora prince
[19218.24s -> 19224.47s]  What is your name?
[19224.47s -> 19226.47s]  People really like syden
[19226.95s -> 19227.91s]  Okay
[19227.91s -> 19242.26s]  Have we ever met this person?
[19242.26s -> 19243.78s]  I mean in the other
[19243.78s -> 19245.22s]  Uh zelda games
[19245.22s -> 19248.84s]  Is prince syden a character that's in the other games?
[19249.40s -> 19258.93s]  That's me
[19258.93s -> 19267.88s]  I am a zora prince after all I have an eye for talent that is unparalleled
[19268.84s -> 19270.46s]  Yes exquisite
[19270.46s -> 19276.81s]  I've been searching for someone like you for a long while a man like you link who carries himself with power
[19277.90s -> 19284.22s]  Right now zora's domain is in grave danger because of the massive rainfall coming from divine beast varuta. Okay, that explains it
[19284.94s -> 19291.40s]  Please promise you will help us. We need your strength warrior. Won't you please come to zora's domain?
[19292.12s -> 19306.86s]  Sure now zora's domain will be saved for certain no time to waste. Hurry up and head over
[19308.22s -> 19313.13s]  Because of the rain the cliffs are too wet to climb I figured that out earlier
[19314.06s -> 19316.46s]  To reach the domain you will need to go straight along this path
[19319.43s -> 19321.59s]  As a hylian, I know you are unable to swim up
[19324.36s -> 19326.52s]  As such the path to the domain may be difficult
[19327.48s -> 19331.32s]  You likely have a tough fight in store. There are monsters up ahead that attack with electricity
[19335.94s -> 19340.15s]  Don't give up. I believe in you
[19340.15s -> 19342.15s]  Oh, that's right. I have something that I'd like to give you
[19342.55s -> 19346.52s]  small trinket
[19346.52s -> 19348.52s]  electro elixir
[19349.10s -> 19352.12s]  Cool grants of mid-level resistance to electricity
[19352.76s -> 19382.17s]  Everybody loves this person. Everybody loves it
[19383.13s -> 19385.98s]  Sidon, but who's my favorite character?
[19405.99s -> 19411.18s]  I need to know who my favorite character. All right, so we're gonna go to we're gonna do this, but not yet
[19411.26s -> 19420.14s]  What did I just what the hell is this hero's path mode? Wait, is this showing?
[19420.86s -> 19428.66s]  Is this showing where I've been like these frivolous? What?
[19429.54s -> 19431.54s]  What what happened here?
[19432.98s -> 19448.58s]  What happened here? I don't know what I did over here press a
[19455.27s -> 19461.56s]  What killed me? Uh-huh
[19474.07s -> 19476.07s]  Wasn't that the first area?
[19480.71s -> 19482.71s]  I teleported to this
[19486.02s -> 19488.02s]  How many times did you guys die in this first like
[19488.66s -> 19502.20s]  Level one starter zone
[19502.20s -> 19514.42s]  What was going on here? This is not accurate. This is not accurate
[19515.72s -> 19519.42s]  What happened?
[19519.42s -> 19521.50s]  What did I do was I fucking drunk?
[19522.14s -> 19527.26s]  Was I high?
[19527.26s -> 19546.57s]  What happened? Oh, that's the stone guy, right? How do you die in kakariko village? It's impossible
[19563.53s -> 19567.30s]  God damn it, man. Oh my god
[19610.78s -> 19641.88s]  Okay, so I teleported back to there back to the same spot. Why did I teleport back here? What are you doing?
[19658.25s -> 19682.98s]  Here we are. Why did I teleport three times the same place? That's a cool. I like that feature a lot
[19682.98s -> 19691.69s]  That's so fun. Go fight that guy now. Oh my should I go get revenge? I'm getting revenge
[19709.98s -> 19731.24s]  I got bomb arrows. This guy is in deep shit. I don't have any hammers. Do I actually need a hammer?
[19740.70s -> 19743.77s]  All right, where is this dude?

[19813.75s -> 19816.49s]  Really?
[19816.49s -> 19855.18s]  Will I beat this game and lock this monster? What the hell is that thing? Oh my god. I have an idea
[19855.42s -> 19866.46s]  Why are these not exploding? It's a bomb arrow
[19871.22s -> 19873.46s]  What because it's raining?
[19884.87s -> 19911.02s]  I'm kind of more curious about the huge dragon eel serpent thing that was just flying around over here. Where'd it go?
[19911.99s -> 19913.11s]  Whoa

[20881.05s -> 20883.05s]  Put the metal away, dude
[20886.81s -> 20889.13s]  Metal in a lightning storm. That's really what it was
[20893.29s -> 20903.14s]  So what all the uh, uh, uh, I really am just a walking conductor, aren't I? I get it. I feel

[21338.74s -> 21378.52s]  All right. So what's up here? Interesting. Come on, dude. Really? I don't have a single arrow. You gotta be shitting me
[21425.80s -> 21433.05s]  And I still get the item I can probably get the torch too where to go that went way over
[21439.34s -> 21443.37s]  Ah
[21443.37s -> 21449.62s]  Look at that. Would you look at that shrine?
[21496.49s -> 21497.69s]  Oh, i'll get this tower
[21497.69s -> 21532.07s]  Oh, i'm almost out of terrible weapons. Oh, no, i'm not done. I got this one. No get down

[21611.46s -> 21615.27s]  But
[21615.27s -> 21633.34s]  I'm just checking around the sides. You never know. It's two week rift. Are you playing slime rancher tomorrow? No
[21634.25s -> 21637.72s]  I'm doing birthday stuff tomorrow. I'll be back on saturday. We're gonna do
[21639.16s -> 21644.06s]  Uh slime rancher 2 on saturday and then probably back to breath of the wild on sunday
[21644.30s -> 21684.76s]  You gotta do a birthday stream. No, i'm not doing a birthday stream a lot of enemies here a lot of enemies here
[21695.77s -> 21710.15s]  Thank god long enough for me to find some. Okay, so take off unequip literally everything, right? How do I unequip everything?
[21716.42s -> 21723.74s]  I take off all I because uh the lightning shit i'm not holding anything. I'm just naked
[21723.82s -> 21728.62s]  I'm not gonna get struck by lightning, right?
[21728.62s -> 21730.62s]  I won't get struck by lightning if i'm naked
[21733.45s -> 21739.16s]  I hope that's accurate
[21739.16s -> 21753.30s]  Clothes are fine
[21753.30s -> 21760.06s]  And wooden weapons are fine. I don't think I have anything that's wood. There's the harpoon. I mean this is metal at the end
[21760.14s -> 21779.32s]  No, just climbing
[21779.32s -> 21782.71s]  These metal
[21789.43s -> 21841.96s]  Take them off take them off. Okay, we're good clothes do not matter ants are safe clothes don't matter
[21842.92s -> 21847.72s]  Well, um, I made it up here
[21852.36s -> 21865.94s]  Pants are safe. All right, here's the plan two more shrines. I'm gonna do the omega turn in level up twice
[21866.50s -> 21868.50s]  And then probably call it there
[21868.90s -> 21886.62s]  I got one shrine marked. Oh if it's sparking in the menu, it's unsafe. That's interesting. Okay
[21887.10s -> 21901.42s]  Good to know let's take a quick look
[21901.50s -> 21906.92s]  You can't say omega when it's not omega gaming weekend
[21908.07s -> 21909.19s]  That's true
[21909.19s -> 21913.67s]  No, you're right. Okay, that one's marked
[21917.40s -> 21920.12s]  Any others from here I could be able to see a lot. Um
[21924.26s -> 21926.66s]  Not that I can see from here. I think that's the only one
[21927.38s -> 21936.86s]  I think that actually is the only one
[21940.65s -> 21942.23s]  Yeah
[21942.23s -> 21944.23s]  Really? Damn. What about here?
[21949.42s -> 21951.14s]  Is that
[21951.14s -> 21953.14s]  Rubble or something or is that a monster?
[21953.78s -> 21959.91s]  I'm marking it whatever it is
[21959.91s -> 21961.91s]  All right. Well, let's go
[21965.53s -> 21969.05s]  I can't get struck by lightning in the air, but i'm just ready to get struck
[21969.69s -> 21983.50s]  Look at the menu. Oh
[21983.90s -> 21988.78s]  Okay
[21988.78s -> 21991.78s]  So these are safe
[21992.44s -> 22000.63s]  Cool, they do a little twinkle
[22011.70s -> 22042.98s]  I'm too lazy to go pick that up pretty good snapshot. Oh you ducked. Did you just go like this?

[23263.05s -> 23265.77s]  This is the last shrine we're doing tonight, then i'm gonna go level up twice
[23272.06s -> 23280.87s]  And then uh, i'm gonna like half hour. You need to have you need ancient horse here. That's cool
[23296.90s -> 23298.90s]  Combat trial or a puzzle trial
[23300.68s -> 23310.97s]  I know this is a combat trial. I got plenty of good weapons. This should be I should be able to do this pretty easily
[23312.66s -> 23318.95s]  Minor test of strength. Okay, i'll be fine. At least I hope so
[23321.05s -> 23337.62s]  I shouldn't use a fishing harpoon though. Use this thing
[23340.71s -> 23377.26s]  Why won't you dodge sideways dodge sideways finally what the heck is happening
[23425.24s -> 23426.28s]  Uh-oh
[23426.28s -> 23434.15s]  You do this thing out of here guardian sword and another guardian shield
[23439.99s -> 23460.62s]  Yep, can't carry any more shields. Yes, I can. It's the same thing. I'll get rid of this one then
[23461.58s -> 23473.72s]  Uh
[23473.72s -> 23482.82s]  Yep. Yeah, wait 16 and eight. Uh, whatever keep the wood one. I thought this one was 18. Okay 16
[23484.87s -> 23488.57s]  All right
[23488.57s -> 23489.99s]  so all the
[23489.99s -> 23491.85s]  guardian shield plus
[23491.85s -> 23498.38s]  Okay, cool. Where's your nintendo shirt? I had it on for like four hours
[23498.70s -> 23510.52s]  It was just getting really sweaty and hot so I just take it off boomerang. I don't want that
[23511.00s -> 23515.67s]  Oh better than the this
[23526.57s -> 23530.73s]  Cool, okay. Now I need to go back to the village
[23532.79s -> 23535.11s]  And i'm gonna level up stamina twice
[23538.23s -> 23550.63s]  Is that bad? Or should I do health twice? I feel like I need the hearts. I'm gonna do uh hearts twice
[23552.97s -> 23554.02s]  Yeah
[23554.02s -> 23564.81s]  Only a four
[23564.81s -> 23567.61s]  Yeah, I gotta stop. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a four health Andy. I know it's bad
[23567.93s -> 23572.76s]  Maybe I won't get one hit killed by the regular enemies anymore if I had six hearts
[23576.17s -> 23588.73s]  We scream
[23588.73s -> 23591.10s]  So i'm good
[23591.10s -> 23601.82s]  I'm gonna go back to uh, where's that? Where do I need to go here? Where's that thing?
[23603.70s -> 23611.27s]  Shrine island
[23611.27s -> 23622.73s]  All towns have a statue. Okay. Well, i'll just go back to next to impa two hearts
[23631.80s -> 23634.28s]  Oh, i'm gonna bet that yeah the seed guy too. I'll do that as well
[23635.72s -> 23637.72s]  Just cleaning up some loose ends
[23638.20s -> 23650.94s]  All right, so saying right
[23651.02s -> 23653.26s]  next to impa's house
[23653.85s -> 23699.35s]  Which is here right on a heart container i'm doing too very good do it again
[23712.65s -> 23720.79s]  All right. That's feels pretty good. Now. I want to go back to
[23721.27s -> 23747.78s]  I marked you on the map right here, right? Okay. I'll just walk here. He's not there anymore upgrade your armor
[23751.83s -> 23753.35s]  Oh, that's right
[23753.35s -> 23763.82s]  That's right. That's right. That's right. All right, we're gonna go there first still there
[23768.07s -> 23827.51s]  So i'm gonna upgrade my chest piece first. He still might be there. Okay, welcome back enhance away. Let's go
[23827.59s -> 23831.64s]  All right, so the chest piece it goes from three to five
[23833.67s -> 23837.53s]  Or I could do the helmet
[23837.53s -> 23839.61s]  Three to five three to five is the same thing
[23843.46s -> 23847.88s]  Maybe the armor
[23847.88s -> 23850.34s]  I feel like the helmet
[23850.34s -> 23854.34s]  Because if I find a much better chest piece, I could still keep the helmet on
[23860.30s -> 23868.17s]  i'm doing it
[23868.17s -> 23885.94s]  Thank you five armor nice set of clothes that have all been enhanced twice can have a bonus
[23886.34s -> 23888.10s]  But you have to wear the whole thing
[23888.10s -> 23902.81s]  I mean i'm wearing the pants
[23903.69s -> 23922.30s]  I mean, why not?
[23922.30s -> 23926.38s]  How hard is it? I feel like these materials are not hard to get so i'm just gonna do it
[23931.14s -> 23937.02s]  Just in case at least a level one stuff
[23947.69s -> 23953.53s]  Very cool. Okay. Now I did
[23955.93s -> 23962.42s]  Upgraded my gear
[23962.42s -> 23965.62s]  That was step one of two now i'm going over here
[23971.43s -> 23974.07s]  To see if that guy's there to do inventory slots
[23980.28s -> 23982.46s]  Then i'm gonna wrap it up
[23983.66s -> 23991.58s]  This doesn't do this
[23991.82s -> 23994.31s]  I don't know what to do with this
[23994.87s -> 24014.17s]  The ball somewhere
[24014.17s -> 24020.84s]  You can do this again next stream. I will do this again on sunday plan is to do

[24050.71s -> 24052.71s]  If you want me to continue and you want me to beat it
[24053.19s -> 24055.19s]  Then i'll just keep playing it
[24061.99s -> 24068.10s]  Yeah, definitely
[24068.10s -> 24071.46s]  All right. Where are you?
[24071.46s -> 24072.74s]  Yeah, you're still there
[24072.74s -> 24084.70s]  All right. I got five of these
[24084.70s -> 24085.90s]  All right

[24086.78s -> 24090.66s]  another weapon stash
[24090.66s -> 24092.66s]  I go through weapons. So crazy
[24092.98s -> 24094.34s]  and then maybe

[24172.22s -> 24175.46s]  Maybe we'll see you again
[24175.46s -> 24178.92s]  a couple days
[24178.92s -> 24183.24s]  Slime rancher 2 going into early. I don't know how much content will be in slime rancher 2 is early access
[24183.24s -> 24196.84s]  So I will find out but i'll see you later. Thanks for watching
[24198.02s -> 24203.22s]  Save your game. I will do it right now officially saved
[24208.10s -> 24212.84s]  Okay, they were a shitload of subs today
[24216.04s -> 24223.53s]  This is 25 pages of subs. Are you kidding me? Oh my god. Well, thank you
[24224.17s -> 24247.08s]  I'll have a good birthday. I'm just i'm just gonna it's gonna be chill our prime subs included in the credits
[24247.08s -> 24251.64s]  I think all subs are any sub that comes through during the time the stream is live. I think is there
[24255.43s -> 24257.35s]  Yeah, there was some big gifted subs, too
[24257.35s -> 24278.60s]  Yeah, i'm sure probably some of you saw the news about twitch's changing how they monetizing partners. Let me just be very clear
[24279.83s -> 24285.40s]  Um, I ain't fucking running ads. It's just not happening
[24286.39s -> 24287.19s]  So
[24287.19s -> 24297.62s]  We'll see however that plays out
[24297.62s -> 24303.69s]  I mean, I I obviously have opinions on it and you know, one of the major ones is
[24305.13s -> 24312.86s]  I don't want to be forced to run ads because in my mind a ton of people are already paying
[24314.09s -> 24317.40s]  Essentially a premium to the stream
[24319.93s -> 24326.46s]  So I don't oh, yeah, thanks for your essentially kind of like netflix like subscription
[24328.01s -> 24333.11s]  Here's a shitload of ads every day. I don't want to do that. So i'm i'm not going to
[24335.19s -> 24344.23s]  Um, if I am forced to run ads on this platform, I will leave this platform
[24346.50s -> 24353.38s]  100%
[24353.38s -> 24355.05s]  so
[24355.05s -> 24357.05s]  I'm not going to be forced to run ads
[24360.36s -> 24366.38s]  Now here's the thing ads do play pre-rolls play and I don't really have that much control over that
[24366.86s -> 24375.06s]  I do have control over if one essentially runs while you're sitting here and I don't want to do that
[24375.14s -> 24377.70s]  I don't want to run ads
[24377.70s -> 24382.02s]  You've seen ads on big streams before sometimes to fill dead air
[24382.66s -> 24384.63s]  sometimes part of a
[24384.63s -> 24400.82s]  Obligation but regardless of of how they're changing subscription revenue. I'm not going to run ads. Let's run an ad right now
[24402.54s -> 24405.18s]  Ads aren't that bad ads aren't that bad
[24406.04s -> 24409.80s]  They really aren't in the grand scheme of things if it depends on how many you run
[24410.68s -> 24419.30s]  But I don't want to be forced to do them the thing about ads, especially on twitch. They're pretty intrusive
[24419.54s -> 24426.82s]  For a few reasons one if they happen automatically we could be in the middle of doing something
[24427.30s -> 24434.12s]  And you're just gone for two to three straight fucking minutes. It takes over the whole screen. You don't even
[24434.84s -> 24439.72s]  What if you missed something interesting like one of eight or like one of four or one of three?
[24439.72s -> 24444.84s]  Whatever it is now running ads on a brb is something that okay
[24444.92s -> 24447.08s]  Yeah, that may maybe that would make sense
[24447.08s -> 24462.15s]  But I don't want to be forced to run ads if you're contractually obligated to run ads
[24462.15s -> 24470.14s]  Yeah, that's not the case right now, but I don't want that to be the case and if it does become the case
[24470.30s -> 24485.26s]  I'll just leave I mean that I really do the phrase ads aren't that bad as a weak mindset
[24485.58s -> 24487.58s]  You're okay with what happened losing imperfection
[24488.66s -> 24490.66s]  Uh, is that a meme? What is that?
[24503.34s -> 24505.58s]  Oh, it's the ninja thing, okay
[24506.78s -> 24513.88s]  But I just want to be clear about that because I know that a lot of people might be saying oh shit
[24515.64s -> 24517.64s]  Which is changing how money and
[24518.52s -> 24523.32s]  He's gonna quote have to make up the money. No, I don't give a fuck. No, I don't care
[24524.84s -> 24528.04s]  If you I want people to have the best viewing experience if I can
[24528.92s -> 24532.36s]  I'm not gonna just run ads if I have to i'll just i'll literally stream
[24532.68s -> 24535.00s]  I'll literally make fucking videos again or something. I don't know
[24554.42s -> 24558.50s]  Yeah, I don't know I i'm not gonna make any statements about
[24559.46s -> 24564.34s]  I have some ideas of maybe I would want to change platforms or something, right? That's not what this is for
[24565.30s -> 24566.66s]  a lot of these
[24566.66s -> 24569.70s]  Changes are not even happening till like the what the middle of next year
[24570.98s -> 24573.30s]  So there's lots of time to figure out what I would want to do
[24578.82s -> 24579.86s]  and
[24579.86s -> 24580.92s]  if
[24580.92s -> 24584.92s]  Which changes a lot of their policies to make it so you have to run ads or something. It's like, I don't know
[24586.06s -> 24587.50s]  I'd rather just
[24587.58s -> 24593.42s]  Stream off like youtube and not have to do that if I didn't have to and let me maybe make videos again
[24594.30s -> 24595.66s]  I don't know
[24595.66s -> 24598.60s]  I really don't know
[24599.32s -> 24602.36s]  But i'm trying to be transparent with everybody right now
[24604.22s -> 24609.42s]  Um, and that's me being transparent
[24615.03s -> 24619.59s]  We got about uh, 10 months before this is even a question to even figure out
[24620.39s -> 24623.05s]  So don't worry. It's not like oh, all right. Well
[24623.05s -> 24624.63s]  That's
[24624.63s -> 24626.79s]  See you on see on youtube tomorrow. No
[24627.43s -> 24631.51s]  Uh, this is like a year away before a major decision like that will have to get made
[24635.21s -> 24637.21s]  But i'm going
[24637.69s -> 24641.37s]  I'm gonna be where I think is the best viewing experience for people here
[24643.56s -> 24648.44s]  Regardless of how much money I would or would not be making or would or would be losing but whatever
[24649.32s -> 24651.21s]  We'll see
[24651.21s -> 24653.14s]  We'll see
[24653.14s -> 24655.86s]  But uh, have a great night. I'm gonna go do birthday stuff
[24656.58s -> 24661.64s]  Have a great night guys
[24661.72s -> 24666.62s]  Take care of yourselves
[24666.62s -> 24668.62s]  Oh, yeah, there is a trombone game, isn't there?
[24669.18s -> 24673.38s]  I keep people I see people play the trombone game. What is it fun?
[24674.26s -> 24685.14s]  Should I do it?
[24685.14s -> 24687.14s]  Yes, please. Okay
[24688.30s -> 24690.30s]  It sucks
[24692.81s -> 24696.50s]  It looks fun. All right. Good night guys. See you soon
[24697.30s -> 24698.82s]  Take care of yourselves
[24698.82s -> 24701.26s]  Goodbye. See you saturday
