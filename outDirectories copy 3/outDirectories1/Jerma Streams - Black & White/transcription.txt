[67.06s -> 71.54s]  Oh, I don't have it. Where's my intro video? Oh, that's right. I cleaned up. I cleaned up. Hey,
[71.54s -> 75.62s]  go back to talking to each other. Sure, hold on. Go back to talking to each other.
[100.09s -> 106.57s]  Shit, I think I deleted them. So, all right, I do this thing every year where I clean up my computer,
[107.45s -> 114.97s]  delete a bunch of old shit, delete a bunch of old temporary documents, and I think I deleted
[114.97s -> 123.22s]  my intro videos and my outro videos. How did I do that? No, I didn't. Why would I have done that?
[123.22s -> 130.04s]  Because I just tried to play it and it didn't work. Hold on. Oh, shit. This is the new intro.
[131.40s -> 135.86s]  Wait, wait, wait. I'll get it. I'll get it. Where is it? No, here it is.
[136.66s -> 149.27s]  So, where the hell is it? Oh, all right. Why is it over here? Well, fuck it. All right. Well,
[149.27s -> 160.66s]  hey, guys. Today, we're going to play a game called Black and White. Black and White. It is a...
[160.66s -> 164.82s]  All right. I don't want you to... I don't want you on camera anymore. All right. Here we go.
[164.82s -> 177.27s]  Here's the real intro. Where the fuck is it? This is actually annoying me. Where is it? Okay. Hey,
[177.27s -> 267.37s]  all right. See you in a minute. It's pre-manning and on yet. Bye. Okay. So, the plan today. Yes,
[267.69s -> 274.57s]  I'm not 100% recovered from being sick. I remember a few days ago, I started to get a bad migraine
[274.57s -> 280.17s]  and I was like, ah, fuck, I got a migraine. And then it just turned into a full blown just head
[280.17s -> 289.56s]  cold. I had a bad sore throat. My head was hurting. Kim now has it. So, it's not... It's just the
[289.56s -> 294.28s]  season. But I'm feeling all right now. I'm coming down from it. It's been a few days
[295.16s -> 304.09s]  and my head is not as hurting as much. So, I can spring. Good to go. With that, we're going to play,
[304.09s -> 307.45s]  like I said, Black and White. You've never heard of Black and White before. You're probably like,
[307.45s -> 311.37s]  wait a minute. And if you have heard of Black and White, you just... You just pog to your pants
[311.37s -> 319.34s]  right now. You shit your pants. Because this is... This is one of the most classic old
[320.06s -> 326.46s]  God simulating games that existed. Everybody that had a PC back 10, 15 years ago loved this game.
[327.34s -> 334.74s]  It's a lion head game. It's old lion head. The problem is they never ported it anywhere. They
[334.74s -> 341.78s]  never did anything with this. This series is just lost forever, apparently. They made a second one.
[343.46s -> 348.92s]  But it's just one of those games that everybody's just... Where's the third one? Give us a new
[348.92s -> 358.09s]  Black and White, please. It's one of those games. So, without further ado, welcome back, everybody.
[358.17s -> 363.42s]  I cannot promise you a, like, 12-hour spring today, but I can promise you a 10.
[365.58s -> 370.70s]  Let's go. Black and White. Why did I just... No, why did I just say that?
[372.06s -> 375.10s]  I'm not doing a 10-hour spring. This is probably going to be, like,
[375.10s -> 380.62s]  five. I got a headache. Okay, I got a headache. I got a headache. I got a headache. I'm doing it,
[380.62s -> 391.24s]  and I'm not doing that. Liar. Liar. Here we go. Black and White on an HD screen. That's right.
[392.04s -> 400.63s]  Wait, hold on. I gotta do this first. All right. You get one... You get... You get one more second.
[402.89s -> 413.22s]  Make it count, because you never... This is never happening ever again. Okay. Somebody
[413.22s -> 422.55s]  Pogged their fans already. Pog... Oh, that's so stupid. All right. Here we go. Black and White.
[423.11s -> 431.56s]  Open it. Uh-oh. Did it just insta-crash? Wait. I tested this, like, a thousand times. I tested
[431.56s -> 437.64s]  this a thousand times. This should not have insta-crashed. Okay. I tested this a thousand
[437.64s -> 448.17s]  times. It insta-crashed. Hold on. Okay. Jesus, man. Gonna give me a fucking heart attack.
[448.73s -> 463.32s]  I was gonna say, no way. Black and White, ladies and gentlemen. Lionhead Studios. Peter Molyneux.
[465.03s -> 476.15s]  The greatest video game developer to have ever fucking lived. In his own words.
[476.15s -> 482.28s]  Please choose from one of the following options. Start the game normally. Skip straight to the
[482.28s -> 486.52s]  creature select. Skip all of the creature to keep your... All right. I did open... I'm gonna...
[486.52s -> 493.43s]  I'm gonna be completely transparent here. I did open this, because I wanted to make sure I could
[493.43s -> 502.28s]  get it captured and in full HD texture. Uh, what's gonna start the game normally? You ready? What
[502.28s -> 508.84s]  the fuck is this game? You'll see. Is it gonna be a smash hit? I knew it. I knew it when I... I knew
[508.84s -> 514.09s]  it. It's gonna be a smash hit. Remember your favorite stream of, like, the last 10 years?
[515.05s -> 517.29s]  Add this one. Smash hit. Here we go.
[529.43s -> 532.39s]  Jinxed it. I'm just kidding. Am I though?
[550.79s -> 557.66s]  Don't go in the water! Wait, why? Why can't... Oh, because there's sharks.
[572.89s -> 573.93s]  I'll handle this.
[577.37s -> 600.28s]  That kid was fast. So those of you that wanted me to play Godhand, this is close enough, I think,
[600.28s -> 626.95s]  right? This does two birds with one stone. I read this script already. Yeah, we talked... We did...
[626.95s -> 633.62s]  Pre-stream gets a couple of jokes that happen on stream, all right? And somebody said, hey,
[633.62s -> 639.38s]  I saw that joke four hours ago in pre-stream. Yeah, it's fucking easy joke to make. Everybody
[639.46s -> 643.78s]  wants me to play Godhand. I'm playing a game where you play a literal hand of a god.
[643.78s -> 647.22s]  It's the easiest comedy ever. This kid just got hit by a fucking meteor.
[660.89s -> 664.01s]  Thank you, God. I did.
[664.89s -> 670.97s]  Thank you. Thank you for your mercy. We praise you. I require
[671.93s -> 678.42s]  all three of you to do a Fortnite dance. There it is. Okay, good. Good. I like that one. That's
[678.42s -> 688.52s]  the one where you go up and down with your hand. Good one. Greetings. We're your conscience. Good
[688.52s -> 696.04s]  and evil. Chaotic evil. Black and white. As part of you, we'll guide you through this world.
[696.04s -> 708.12s]  Chaotic evil. Okay. Good and evil. Should I be good or should I be evil? What do you think?
[708.12s -> 717.77s]  Our people will want to worship you. Please come with us to our village. Be evil? Why would I be
[717.77s -> 727.40s]  evil? I'll show you how to follow them. How to move. Let's see. You move your hand in the direction
[727.40s -> 734.04s]  you want to travel like this. Then you click and hold the move button. After that, you move the
[734.04s -> 740.60s]  mouse towards you to drag forwards. You grab the ground and drag backwards. You click, hold, and
[740.60s -> 746.71s]  pull again to cover more grounds. Sorry. Yeah, you actually have to grab the hand and move.
[747.51s -> 756.41s]  He's got sticky keys on. No, I don't. Follow your new worshipers to the village.
[756.41s -> 759.85s]  You'll have to grab the landscape several times. All right, let's go see their village.
[760.49s -> 764.54s]  I actually love this game and its sequel. Me too. All right, here we go.
[765.50s -> 774.97s]  This, this, you don't think this is going to be scary? What's the thing from Adam's family?
[775.85s -> 782.90s]  Cousin It? This thing's just running next to you? Not cousin it. What's it called? Not lurch.
[782.90s -> 788.18s]  Lurch is the tall guy. Thing. I'm right, I'm literally just right next to you.
[789.22s -> 800.47s]  The thing, thing, yes, thing. I'm right. I'm literally in my field of view.
[801.67s -> 805.72s]  How far away is your village? What were you guys doing out here?
[806.92s -> 813.00s]  I was foretold. The prophecy has come true. We can now finish the temple.
[814.68s -> 824.33s]  Let's go. Let's move to the temple by clicking and dragging or double click the move button
[824.33s -> 829.21s]  on it to go straight there. Same guy. All right, let's move to the temple clicking and dragging
[829.21s -> 837.56s]  or double click the move button to go straight there. Ooh, the move button. Temple. There it is.
[839.00s -> 845.40s]  We're, I think we're almost at the most important part of the entire game and that is
[846.36s -> 851.72s]  who do I want to be? Hey, it's not finished. Who do I want? And you'll, what's he, what's he
[851.72s -> 855.96s]  talking about? What do you mean? We're talking, you'll see. This temple will be the focus of our
[855.96s -> 864.54s]  power. Okay, good. But now it's time to learn how to look around. I'm going to do a poll.
[865.42s -> 869.74s]  Yeah, we'll do a poll. You move the hand to the side of the screen until the rotate
[869.74s -> 875.18s]  arrow appears like this. You hold down the move button. Then you move. I can't wait
[875.18s -> 879.50s]  to play this. Rotate around and see things from a different angle.
[880.38s -> 883.82s]  Certainly circular motion. Hold down the move. You can rotate either way.
[885.82s -> 889.45s]  Do a smart click instead. I actually, my smart clicks are broken.
[890.17s -> 893.05s]  They're all fucked up. You can also use the keyboard to rotate.
[894.25s -> 901.34s]  Okay, yeah. Now you try looking around. Just dragging around. You can go like this. You can
[901.34s -> 908.58s]  go like this. Not middle mouse. What was it? Not right mouse. What was it? I wasn't paying
[908.58s -> 916.95s]  attention. Shift. There it is. Wait, what? Is it not shift? Shift what?
[919.19s -> 927.86s]  Yeah, I was, oh, edge of the screen, right? Edge of the screen. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's right.
[931.85s -> 935.93s]  Okay, cool. Good. Now let's learn how to- How do you look up and down?
[936.89s -> 942.41s]  You move your hand to the top or bottom edge of the screen until the pitch arrow appears.
[942.41s -> 945.13s]  You hold down the move button. I don't want to have to do that. What's the key? Then you
[945.13s -> 949.13s]  move the hand to look up and down. You can do this with the middle mouse button.
[950.86s -> 953.18s]  You can do all this with the middle mouse button. I don't even need to know this.
[954.14s -> 958.41s]  But we have to do this tutorial. You can also use the keyboard to pitch.
[959.05s -> 966.57s]  Now you have a go. Yeah, middle mouse button's gonna do this. Splendid. That's it. That's it.
[966.65s -> 974.49s]  You've got the idea. But I know that doing tutorials, it's just a thing. If I just blow
[974.49s -> 981.45s]  through it, I don't care. Oh, now time to play and I don't fucking know what I'm doing.
[981.45s -> 986.17s]  You move the mouse towards you to zoom out. You know what I mean? Like that. It's gonna make
[986.17s -> 992.84s]  people angry. And you move the mouse away from you to zoom in. Zooming, as you see, is extremely
[992.84s -> 999.40s]  useful. You can also use the keyboard to zoom. Now you try. Yeah, I know how to do this. I know.
[999.40s -> 1006.20s]  Yeah. And see, I told you, I didn't even need to do that. That's it. You've done it. All this moving
[1006.20s -> 1012.44s]  around is giving me a headache. I think we may need to practice a bit. We can go to the God's
[1012.44s -> 1019.64s]  playground by pressing F2 on the keyboard at any time. Wait, what? Now we've learned how to
[1019.64s -> 1028.50s]  move and look. We can help the villagers build the temple. I saw somebody resident sleeper over
[1028.50s -> 1036.26s]  there. I want you to remember that resident sleeper in 20 minutes. I want you to remember
[1036.26s -> 1043.22s]  that. I want you to wake up and go, what the fuck have I written? In 20 minutes, I want you to
[1043.22s -> 1046.98s]  remember what you've written. I want you to look at it. I want you to look at the screen and go,
[1046.98s -> 1053.32s]  I wrote that 20 minutes ago. All right, let's take some food and wood from the store to the
[1053.32s -> 1059.24s]  builders. First, you move the hand over the food or wood like this. You feed villagers by pressing
[1059.24s -> 1065.32s]  the action button. The longer you hold, the more you pick up. You can still drag while holding
[1065.32s -> 1073.94s]  objects. See, I helped. I'm just a big hand. You press the action button while holding an object
[1073.94s -> 1089.82s]  to drop it. All right, here we go. So let's get some wood. How much wood do we need? How much wood
[1089.82s -> 1094.14s]  do they have? All right, I'm taking all of them. I sure don't need to take this much. All right,
[1094.14s -> 1108.49s]  I don't need to take this much. Okay, I have 5,000. How much does it need? All right, I got it.
[1108.49s -> 1124.33s]  Wood required zero. Very good. He's the wood god. See, look at him. And it's got great music too.
[1124.33s -> 1129.37s]  I'm not picking him up yet. You guys, this is, this is, if I pick up somebody and like
[1130.25s -> 1134.57s]  yeet him into the ocean, I'm going to get negative god points. You want me to be good, not evil.
[1143.30s -> 1161.05s]  All right, do I need more wood? Yeet the non-believers. Oops. Oh, no, there we go.
[1161.77s -> 1172.79s]  I don't know. It just takes time. It just takes time. There we go. What happened? Oh, they said,
[1172.79s -> 1182.41s]  wow. There it is. They're trying to best straw poll for good or evil. No, I'm going to decide
[1182.41s -> 1197.26s]  there's no good. There is no good and there is no evil. This game's called black and white. I know.
[1198.14s -> 1206.26s]  But sometimes good people do evil things. Sometimes evil people do good things.
[1207.06s -> 1213.14s]  This is the entrance. Click the action button on it to take you inside.
[1217.70s -> 1224.41s]  Ray. All right, let's go inside the temple. Incredible. The tribe built all this.
[1225.61s -> 1229.53s]  No good or evil. Only checks. And to think it's a monument to you as a god.
[1230.89s -> 1235.98s]  And us as your conscience, don't forget. The workmanship is amazing.
[1237.34s -> 1242.46s]  And what a symbol of overwhelming evil. Death's in your region. Birth's in your region. No, it isn't.
[1242.46s -> 1248.82s]  Sacrifices. This here must be a map of the homeland. What about all these doors?
[1250.17s -> 1256.49s]  Each leads to a room. The rooms are extremely useful. Let's try some.
[1257.69s -> 1263.27s]  Okay, let me take a look at this. Check out all the writing on the scroll, boss.
[1263.27s -> 1267.27s]  Percentage that believe in you. It's showing lots of information about your followers and
[1267.27s -> 1273.14s]  your villages. Unbelievable. Only 59 people live here. Yeah, look at this.
[1274.10s -> 1278.10s]  Death's in your region. Births. Number of sacrifices. Buildings. Wonders in your region.
[1278.66s -> 1284.26s]  Disciples in your realm. Builders. Breeders. Fishermen. Farmers. Foresters. Missionaries.
[1284.26s -> 1292.65s]  Craftsmen. Traders. Well, let's see. All right, that's cool. Let's take a look at the other rooms.
[1295.56s -> 1303.59s]  This is the save game room. Okay. Here's the library, which I don't think is gonna happen.
[1303.59s -> 1310.17s]  This is the library. The scrolls contain a whole bunch of useful information.
[1314.04s -> 1320.04s]  Village help. Help with village life. Yeah, this is just extra documentation.
[1321.50s -> 1328.20s]  You know, it's just documentation. What does it say? Story history. The evil conscience said the
[1328.20s -> 1332.20s]  scrolls contain a whole bunch of useful information. One line ago the good conscience said this is the
[1332.20s -> 1336.04s]  library. Two lines ago the good conscience said... Am I playing? Is this AI dungeon?
[1336.60s -> 1350.26s]  This is a transcript of what everybody has said. It's a lore scroll.
[1350.74s -> 1356.26s]  All right, what else is in here? I don't remember. Challenge room. I think there's a creature cave.
[1357.46s -> 1365.94s]  Game options. I don't want to touch that. The future room. What is the... Okay, the creature cave.
[1367.70s -> 1374.90s]  Oh, this is an expansion thing, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Yeah, this is like an expansion room.
[1375.46s -> 1382.01s]  What does the challenge room do? This game has like two expansions.
[1386.25s -> 1391.13s]  You can get information on each challenge. Also, if a challenge is unfinished,
[1391.13s -> 1395.13s]  press the button underneath them. All right, so this is challenge room. Let's take a look.
[1395.13s -> 1401.69s]  I'm just trying to get the info. There are no challenges right now. It's just a bunch of empty
[1401.69s -> 1413.53s]  frames. All right, it's time. It's time for the most important thing of the whole day,
[1414.09s -> 1420.36s]  because this does not change, by the way. I think we have to figure out what each one does.
[1420.92s -> 1428.25s]  Daza, thank you. Daza for the 10 community subs. 10 subs from Daza. Whoa. Thank you.
[1428.25s -> 1450.58s]  The future is uncertain. Yeah. So what? More DLC. Yeah, I know. Don't save. I'm not going to save.
[1450.58s -> 1457.94s]  I've read... I've got all the patches that I need. The game can only be saved when it autosaves.
[1458.82s -> 1477.38s]  Yeah, I will actually break it. All right. Who do I want? Who do I want to be?
[1477.38s -> 1484.18s]  It's tough. It's a hard choice. Let's explore. I'm dying to know what these signposts are.
[1484.18s -> 1492.26s]  No, not yet. Not yet. Not yet. We need to learn. No, there's so much we got to do. I say we hunt
[1492.26s -> 1500.63s]  out the gold story scrolls. He just wants to go. He wants to skip. This is
[1500.63s -> 1510.68s]  you. The devil is you guys right now. Oh, let's learn more about the world. No. With Nancy Drew.
[1510.68s -> 1521.78s]  A gold story scroll looks like this. Clicking on gold story scrolls with the action button
[1521.78s -> 1526.02s]  will lead you through your quest in Eden. That's right. You can activate the scroll
[1526.02s -> 1533.90s]  or you can explore. It's up to you, leader. Okay. I'm going to do the right thing.
[1535.72s -> 1539.64s]  You know, I'm going to do the right thing and that's I'm going to make sure that I know what's
[1539.64s -> 1546.44s]  going on. I get a lot of shit for this. I get a lot of shit for this. So I'm not going to go.
[1547.08s -> 1551.48s]  What's the lumber mill do? What's this? What's this do? What's that do? What's the tent do?
[1552.76s -> 1558.44s]  No, I'm going to be good and I'm going to learn. You can scroll through some of these info signs
[1558.44s -> 1565.24s]  to read all the text. Hold the action button. No, no one's dying yet. Any information you
[1565.24s -> 1572.68s]  read on one of these is added to the library in the temple. No one is dying yet. I'm not going to
[1572.68s -> 1577.64s]  have bad points or good points yet. I just want to, I just want to remember how to play the video
[1577.64s -> 1585.99s]  game. The village quiet. Somebody shot a gun. Okay. You didn't think there were guns in this game?
[1587.26s -> 1594.65s]  I think I just saw a bunch of people pog instead of another fire. All right, mute the chat. Mute
[1594.65s -> 1608.15s]  the chat. I don't want to look over there right now. Centrist Gray NPC Jeremy. That's the last
[1608.15s -> 1611.51s]  thing that I read and that's the last thing I'm going to read for the next like 10 minutes.
[1616.12s -> 1623.16s]  Store contains wood and food. You can add either resource to the store. Right. I can,
[1623.16s -> 1627.86s]  I'm still looking over there. You guys are in my head. The villagers will also gather them
[1628.42s -> 1632.82s]  unless they are worshiping. Right. Okay. So this is the store. You can store wood. You can store
[1632.82s -> 1637.38s]  food. It's grain. You can add either resource. The villagers will also gather them unless they
[1637.38s -> 1643.54s]  are worshiping or they are assigned as a disciple to another task. Right. Surrounding flags indicate
[1643.54s -> 1649.38s]  the level of need. The higher the flag is raised, the greater the need of your villages. Place your
[1649.38s -> 1654.02s]  hand over the red of, why did I say red flags? To gain more information about it. Okay. Yeah. So
[1654.02s -> 1660.98s]  here we go. So children desire is what? Food desire. What does, that means they want to have
[1660.98s -> 1668.55s]  children. Well, go for it. What's, how's that stopping me? No, don't put it in emote only.
[1668.55s -> 1673.59s]  Emote only makes it easier for them to be mean to this classic. I can't even believe it.
[1674.55s -> 1684.73s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey. Imagine resident sleeper ring like Half-Life. Imagine. Just imagine. Like
[1684.73s -> 1692.17s]  resident sleeper ring. Half-Life. Because that's what you're doing right now. This is one of the
[1692.17s -> 1702.78s]  most classic fucking top 10 PC games ever existed. I mean, it might be like number nine and Half-Life
[1702.78s -> 1713.54s]  might be like number two. Right. Or whatever. But like, you know, come on. Disable the chat. No,
[1713.54s -> 1720.30s]  I'm moving on. I don't even, whatever. They'll, they'll see. They'll just let, let them resident
[1720.30s -> 1725.74s]  sleeper for the next fucking 40 minutes. They'll see. They'll see when the first boulder rolls
[1725.74s -> 1744.06s]  through the town. They'll see. They're doing it for the jokes. I know. So am I. Backtrack and bury.
[1744.06s -> 1749.74s]  Did you know you can hold the action button to draw, to drown, to down, to pick up increasing
[1749.74s -> 1754.14s]  amounts of food. Yep. You can also drop trees and wooden objects into those stores as well
[1754.14s -> 1761.94s]  as food from the fields or fish from the sea. Yes. So you can just drop food in here. I got it. Okay.
[1763.06s -> 1769.27s]  Relax. Did you know that signposts always contain useful information about the world? Once you've
[1769.27s -> 1774.63s]  read them, their knowledge will appear in the library inside your temple. Yes. You can scroll
[1774.63s -> 1782.68s]  through some of the info signs to read all the text using the action button. Oh, that's cool.
[1782.68s -> 1786.60s]  That's right. All right. If I didn't, imagine if I didn't know that. Imagine resident sleeper ring
[1786.60s -> 1803.05s]  half-life. Did you know you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out? Yes, I know. Oh my God.
[1825.30s -> 1830.97s]  You can use them. Yes, I know that. Yep. Okay. All right. We're good.
[1834.66s -> 1841.70s]  I love this game and I'm going to play it. That's all that needs to be said. So. All right. No,
[1841.70s -> 1845.22s]  don't give it to them. Don't give it to them. Don't give them. Don't just pick somebody up
[1845.22s -> 1849.06s]  and whip them into the ground. Don't do that. That's what they want. That's what they want
[1849.06s -> 1854.71s]  you to do. And I'm not doing it. You could press the following key to show you the name. Oh,
[1854.71s -> 1864.01s]  that's cool. And make tracking their movements easier. That's actually really, really good.
[1864.01s -> 1882.76s]  Interesting. N. That didn't work. N? Yeah. N, right? No, I can't. It doesn't work.
[1885.96s -> 1890.92s]  If you see a house with smoke coming out of it, it is occupied. Okay. To eject the occupants,
[1890.92s -> 1900.90s]  tap the house. Oh, did I just do that? Oh no, there's nobody living here. Let's try somebody.
[1900.90s -> 1904.26s]  People are in the house and green people would show free spaces. All right. Well, get out.
[1906.57s -> 1919.85s]  Get out. I think it's the tutorial. That's why I can't do it. Oh, that's cool. All right. Read
[1919.85s -> 1925.67s]  this one. Placing a man or woman next to someone of the opposite sex turns them into a disciple
[1925.67s -> 1947.93s]  breeder whose only goal is to breed and produce children. Drop. Disciple breeder.
[1948.65s -> 1960.52s]  So we have breeder. Okay. We got breeders. Somebody. I keep hearing like a sniper rifle
[1960.52s -> 1965.99s]  in the distance. It's like freaking me out. You can plant forest by picking up a tree and placing
[1965.99s -> 1970.39s]  it upright in the ground. That's cool. If you place a tree in a village, it becomes a scenic
[1970.39s -> 1974.79s]  addition and will please your people. Foresters will not cut these trees down. All right. That's
[1974.79s -> 1984.34s]  good to know. We're almost there. We're almost there. Every time you activate a gold story
[1984.34s -> 1989.19s]  scroll, you start the next chapter. Okay. All right. Let's. Okay. Here we go.
[1991.05s -> 1998.89s]  I just, I wanted to get that info. Greetings, Holy one. You've activated a gold story scroll.
[1998.89s -> 2004.57s]  I have. My name is Sable. I am a trainer of creatures. I challenge you to open these gates.
[2007.34s -> 2013.42s]  Creatures. Behind them are three wondrous creatures. That's right. Every god has a creature.
[2013.42s -> 2018.22s]  Every god has a creature. Tall as a mountain and can perform miracles. But you can't open
[2018.22s -> 2023.82s]  the gate unless you find the three gate stones. Each stone you find must be placed on this platform.
[2023.82s -> 2033.42s]  I'll get them. Throw her into the ocean. No. The villagers were dancing around a gate stone
[2033.42s -> 2041.93s]  when you arrived. No. Once you place this gate stone on the platform, I will tell you of the
[2041.93s -> 2053.45s]  other two. Throw the ocean into her. Now retrieve the first gate stone, Holy one. Okay. Let's go
[2053.45s -> 2060.57s]  get the gate stone. It was over, where was it over here? Right. It was like on the beach.
[2061.29s -> 2076.57s]  Who lives here? Where was it? Wasn't it like when I first got here? It was like right here, right?
[2077.37s -> 2081.77s]  Yeah, it's right here. Here's the stone that people were dancing around. Pick it up by
[2081.77s -> 2088.49s]  clicking the action button on it and drop it on someone's house to please all the people
[2088.49s -> 2114.41s]  resident sleepering half-life one. Get it? Drop it on her. Excellent. You found a gate stone.
[2114.41s -> 2119.13s]  You'll need to search for another now. Try looking for a gold story scroll in the village.
[2120.17s -> 2131.98s]  I'll find it. Easy. Oh, that's not a scroll. That's a moon. All right, looking for a gold scroll.
[2131.98s -> 2153.80s]  Anybody see a gold scroll here? What's going on here? Oh, Holy one. I kneel before you.
[2156.20s -> 2163.00s]  Nerd neck. My brother suffering a fever has left his sick bed and become lost.
[2166.20s -> 2171.96s]  All right, we're gonna find the lost. He's so weak. I'm frightened he'll die.
[2177.32s -> 2182.04s]  If you find him and bring him home, I'll give you one of the three gate stones.
[2182.04s -> 2190.66s]  It's in my house. Kill him. Hey, I got a plan. Why don't we trash the house?
[2190.66s -> 2196.10s]  We can get the gate stone that way. I heartily object. That's just malicious.
[2196.10s -> 2198.02s]  What do we do? That's kind of the whole point.
[2200.38s -> 2203.18s]  The lost brother is in some trees through the pass.
[2203.18s -> 2219.00s]  What's in the house? What's in the house, lady? Any gold in here?
[2221.35s -> 2226.79s]  Fields are where you people plant crops, which are then harvested and carried to the store.
[2226.79s -> 2230.31s]  Yes, to add to the food pile, you can harvest crops yourself.
[2231.19s -> 2236.23s]  As can your creature. You can also make dedicated farmer disciples by placing villagers in these
[2236.23s -> 2247.22s]  fields. Trash the house. No, if I'm God right now, I go find the lost brother is in some trees
[2247.22s -> 2256.66s]  through the pass. I didn't see this skipper out. Well, there goes the skipping God hand
[2258.68s -> 2285.91s]  on his way. Where is he? No, I can't let them. I can't let them dictate what I'm going to do
[2285.91s -> 2306.44s]  as my as me. I'm bringing them back. There you are. I've been so worried. Do as we command.
[2314.31s -> 2322.04s]  Thank you for your benevolence. Do you want me to go against the title of my own damn stream?
[2330.71s -> 2336.41s]  Now steal. All right. You want me to drop this on somebody and watch them explode?
[2336.41s -> 2338.65s]  Is that what you want? Is that what you seriously want me to do?
[2342.68s -> 2352.14s]  Yes. And everyone calls me the psycho. Holy shit. You're a psycho. I crushed that guy.
[2354.42s -> 2358.66s]  Good. You have two of the gate stones, but the third could be a problem.
[2358.66s -> 2363.94s]  The villagers say the final one was destroyed eons ago. All is not lost though. The village
[2363.94s -> 2368.90s]  sculptor can carve a new gate stone for you. You should see him. All right. Village sculptor.
[2372.70s -> 2379.77s]  What do you got? That's not big enough. It's gotta be way bigger. Holy one. I hear you're looking for
[2379.77s -> 2386.81s]  a gate stone. I am a sculptor. Burn the gate down. If you provide me with the right rock,
[2386.81s -> 2394.97s]  I'll carve one for you. Okay. You'll find the rock I need in the old hermit's quarry. Please
[2394.97s -> 2403.72s]  bring it to you. Smash. I can't. I'm not going to smash and kill people in the tutorial.
[2404.84s -> 2413.82s]  All right. There it is. Go get the big rock. I'm definitely the best sculptor in the village.
[2414.38s -> 2425.70s]  That's why you can't die. You want me to kill the best sculptor in the village? What? Why would I
[2425.70s -> 2431.94s]  do that? Oh, pick up rock and throw rock into people. Okay. Yeah. That's fun. There's no going
[2431.94s -> 2447.30s]  back if I do that. You understand? All right. Where was it over here? Where was it? Right here?
[2447.30s -> 2461.67s]  I thought it was right over here. Wasn't it right there? Over here? Where's this rock?
[2462.39s -> 2468.31s]  Where is it? I can't even go this way. The old hermit's quarry. Yeah. Well, wasn't that like
[2468.31s -> 2491.40s]  right here? That's not, I thought it was right here. Um, which, which one? Does it matter?
[2504.22s -> 2520.57s]  Is this, I can't pick this up. This can't be moved. Um, is this what? No, I need to be bigger than
[2520.57s -> 2535.80s]  that. How do I, I can't move these. Maybe does it matter here? Use this one. I guess this is big
[2535.80s -> 2548.33s]  enough here. Right. That's big enough. Actually, this rock isn't right for the fucking serious.
[2548.33s -> 2561.40s]  Why? No, no, no. Oh shit. No, no, no, no cat. I want to pick them up. Now. Now you believe,
[2561.40s -> 2583.59s]  huh? Now you all start to believe, you know, I didn't believe in that God until he bowling balled
[2583.59s -> 2589.77s]  that rock down the flip. All right. So why can't I pick up? Like I don't, I want to pick it up.
[2590.49s -> 2605.30s]  Am I, am I insane or is it like this one? Yeah. It's this one, right? No. Keep going.
[2609.53s -> 2626.66s]  Nothing else here. It's up the hill. Left, left, left up here. Here's the stone you need.
[2627.62s -> 2637.18s]  Found it. If you press F1, when your hand is over something information on it will be displayed.
[2637.18s -> 2649.08s]  All right. Let's see. Gate stone. I actually have to be careful. I don't want to kill anybody
[2649.08s -> 2660.62s]  accidentally. All right. Let's do this. Here you go. Here's the stone you need. Yeah, I know. I
[2660.62s -> 2665.02s]  just put it down. That's excellent. Exactly the right kind of rock to work with. Dude, Half Life 1.
[2665.02s -> 2667.34s]  Thank you. Come back later and I'll have it finished.
[2670.38s -> 2676.55s]  Come back later. How, how, how much later? The sculptor is still carving the gate stone.
[2676.55s -> 2686.54s]  What am I supposed to do in the meantime? We should speak to the sculptor about the gate stone.
[2686.54s -> 2700.12s]  Hurry up. I don't got all day. I don't have time for this. Oops. Go back to work. Breed with,
[2700.12s -> 2707.19s]  all right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's breed. Oh, this person's already breeding. How much breeding?
[2707.91s -> 2716.38s]  I say some are jigging about on here. What? This village is just chilling. All right. Hold on.
[2717.26s -> 2720.62s]  People are just having sex with each other and stuff. What is going on?
[2721.66s -> 2732.74s]  This village is just chilling. Hold on. Wait, what? That lady, that lady was already pregnant.
[2742.66s -> 2752.47s]  All right. Let's go. The gate stones are together. Pass through and claim your creature. That's the
[2752.79s -> 2761.70s]  Oh, because that's a resident breeder. What? So hold on. Did I, did I designate that person
[2761.70s -> 2783.48s]  to be just a breeder? Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[2783.48s -> 2790.81s]  Here we go. There they are. There they are. You see them? Look at the corner. Do you see?
[2793.85s -> 2796.25s]  I don't see them. I don't see what you're talking about. Oh, I see them.
[2804.07s -> 2813.14s]  Yeah. Look at them. Just look at them. These are miraculous creatures indeed. They certainly are,
[2813.14s -> 2821.06s]  but not quite as big as I expected. Not yet, maybe, but they can become powerful creatures
[2821.06s -> 2828.02s]  in the world. Now that I'd like to see, we must have one. What should we choose? They're all
[2828.10s -> 2835.54s]  special. That makes me like the monkey hearing that like, like that makes me like the monkey,
[2835.54s -> 2841.06s]  but all that we do have nerd neck tiger. You know what I mean? Like this, this is a hard choice.
[2844.41s -> 2849.69s]  There's nerd neck tiger, there's funny monkey, and then there's just absolutely just, just,
[2850.57s -> 2860.44s]  what do you, I don't even know what you call it. Superhero cow. Good luck. You have to pick.
[2860.44s -> 2871.77s]  It's not going to be up to me. They, they all have their own personalities, by the way.
[2880.41s -> 2895.91s]  Monkey, tiger make, this is a really important choice. Okay. Let's see what you guys do.
[2898.57s -> 2904.79s]  I'll get you. I'm going to put them on the screen in full HD so you can see what they all do.
[2917.43s -> 2921.67s]  Oh, come on. You don't look at it. Did you just superhero cow just did a split for you?
[2922.23s -> 2929.10s]  That was very impressive. Whoa, boy. And the superhero cow, unfortunately is going to lose.
[2931.54s -> 2934.58s]  Oh, that's unfortunate. That's unfortunate. I just,
[2937.67s -> 2940.39s]  monkey is going to win. I can't believe it.
[2943.75s -> 2945.67s]  The cow just did a fucking split.
[2945.67s -> 2955.19s]  You have to veto. I have to veto. I have to veto.
[2968.84s -> 2976.36s]  Oh, what was that? I like, like you now. Okay. Cat. I like the tiger now.
[2979.45s -> 2987.38s]  I want the cow. I want the cow. I don't care. No democracy today.
[2987.38s -> 2991.38s]  Are you sure you want this creature? Click on him again if you are.
[2994.09s -> 2995.37s]  Oh, but he just laughed at me.
[2997.61s -> 3001.45s]  How about the ape? Intelligent and quick to learn.
[3001.45s -> 3005.61s]  This is, I can't change this. Oh, it just did no split.
[3007.37s -> 3012.62s]  Chosen a creature.
[3013.18s -> 3031.27s]  He was surprised. The cow was surprised by this, by this. He's like, holy shit, it actually worked.
[3040.06s -> 3044.22s]  You're a dictator. This is your creature's new home.
[3045.66s -> 3050.36s]  He's small at the moment, but look after him and one day he'll be big and powerful.
[3055.45s -> 3059.59s]  He isn't comfortable in his new home yet. In fact, he's a little frightened.
[3060.55s -> 3065.69s]  You can stroke him to reassure him.
[3065.69s -> 3069.37s]  Let's, let's pet, let's pet cow. Can you pet cow? Yes.
[3069.37s -> 3077.05s]  Click and hold the action button, then move your hand to stroke him by holding the action
[3077.05s -> 3082.41s]  button and moving your hand over him gently. Stroking tells him you're approving and it makes
[3082.41s -> 3088.09s]  him happy. Okay, scratch his belly.
[3088.09s -> 3095.70s]  So I'm not trying to do that. I'm going really slow.
[3113.56s -> 3118.20s]  All right, good boy. See how he likes that? He feels much better now.
[3120.60s -> 3124.12s]  Okay. I'll leave you two alone for a while. I'll return later to teach you more.
[3125.08s -> 3136.07s]  He's going to pog. Did he pog? Where are you going? One percent damage.
[3136.07s -> 3140.68s]  Fuck. All right. Let's see. This is your creature's home.
[3140.68s -> 3145.00s]  It feels, he feels safe here and when he rests, he'll grow in size faster. That's right. They get
[3145.00s -> 3151.32s]  fucking huge. You can place interesting things in the pen for your creature and inside the temple
[3151.32s -> 3160.46s]  is a creature's cave full of useful statistics about him. Look at that. Look at that side eye.
[3161.66s -> 3164.14s]  Yeah. Okay. So we can get him toys and stuff. What else can I do?
[3165.26s -> 3173.58s]  Space bar is a shortcut key to place your camera. Get out of here. The space bar is a shortcut key
[3173.58s -> 3179.50s]  to place your camera in a safe position. Press it again to return you to the temple. Pressing it
[3179.50s -> 3186.82s]  again will return you to original. All right. So if I go like, I see. Okay. So you can just like,
[3186.82s -> 3199.00s]  you can have it focused and shit safe, I guess. I see. What do you want? Is he laughing?
[3203.24s -> 3208.60s]  Oh no, he's going, hey, over there. Hey you, go over there. Oh, I love him.
[3210.20s -> 3219.64s]  His voice is kind of annoying. Your creature is getting hungry. Let's eat.
[3219.64s -> 3228.50s]  I suggest you find him something to eat. Choose carefully though. Some things are better for him
[3228.50s -> 3237.16s]  than others. They eat people. All right. We're going to find food. What do you, what do you like
[3237.16s -> 3246.89s]  to eat? Hunger. 100% tiredness. All right. Hungry. What do we eat? If you want a creature to eat
[3246.89s -> 3251.13s]  something, rub his tummy when you give it to him. He'll eat it even if he's not hungry.
[3251.13s -> 3261.94s]  Hungry. Okay. Um, does he eat people? I don't know if you should eat people.
[3261.94s -> 3265.54s]  There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge...
[3265.54s -> 3270.49s]  Does he eat wood? Oh, there's a, wait, there's a reward scroll.
[3270.49s -> 3273.93s]  Oh look, a silver reward scroll. Let's see what it...
[3274.73s -> 3278.97s]  Okay, let's get our projectile skills up the scratch.
[3278.97s -> 3282.65s]  What do you suggest? I presume it involves killing.
[3282.65s -> 3289.13s]  No, not at all. I was going to propose, uh, we, uh, I know...
[3289.13s -> 3290.89s]  I'm gonna feed him. Let's see if we can hit that
[3290.89s -> 3296.41s]  pillar over there. It's a test of our godly powers and nobody gets hurt.
[3296.41s -> 3301.45s]  How nice. And I guess we use this everlasting pile of stones.
[3301.45s -> 3306.12s]  Hmm, handy that. Move your hand over a rock.
[3306.12s -> 3307.80s]  Yeah, all right. This is teaching how to throw.
[3307.80s -> 3311.08s]  Press the action button until the rock is in your hand.
[3311.08s -> 3313.96s]  And we're gonna knock down the rock. Hold down the action button.
[3314.92s -> 3319.56s]  Put momentum on the throw by moving the hand in the correct direction.
[3319.56s -> 3320.52s]  So you can actually...
[3320.52s -> 3322.60s]  Throw the rock by releasing the action button.
[3322.60s -> 3324.76s]  Yeah. Try throwing a rock now.
[3326.04s -> 3333.51s]  There we go. Okay, I need a little bit more.
[3334.39s -> 3335.67s]  Not enough weight behind that one.
[3337.19s -> 3341.99s]  Now that was close.
[3341.99s -> 3396.54s]  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go back to work. Okay.
[3410.04s -> 3411.56s]  I will feed the cow. Just wait.
[3416.97s -> 3419.85s]  That hit. Wait, I have to hit the top thing off?
[3419.85s -> 3420.97s]  Oh my god, this is gonna be...
[3420.97s -> 3422.97s]  You're doing well, but you have...
[3422.97s -> 3428.87s]  I know. Holy shit, that was too fast.
[3438.07s -> 3445.30s]  Oh my god, this is hard.
[3458.54s -> 3459.18s]  Here we go. All right.
[3460.78s -> 3462.30s]  The cow's starving. The cow's gonna be fine.
[3468.68s -> 3470.04s]  We've been given a chest.
[3475.24s -> 3479.08s]  Oh, it's a toy. It's a toy for the cow.
[3482.76s -> 3484.52s]  Awesome. All right. Okay. Look what I got.
[3484.52s -> 3485.64s]  I know you're hungry, but look.
[3490.39s -> 3491.27s]  Where are you? There you are.
[3491.27s -> 3493.51s]  Give your food by putting your hand in front of him
[3493.51s -> 3495.27s]  and then holding the action button.
[3496.39s -> 3496.95s]  Look at this.
[3503.90s -> 3504.70s]  Hey, you.
[3505.66s -> 3511.22s]  Where are you going? All right. You.
[3511.22s -> 3512.42s]  I know. I know. I know.
[3512.42s -> 3513.62s]  I know you're pointing at me. Eat.
[3514.66s -> 3515.38s]  All right. I need food.
[3518.20s -> 3526.78s]  What is this? What is this?
[3526.78s -> 3529.34s]  This is a... I don't know what this is.
[3529.34s -> 3533.58s]  There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.
[3542.26s -> 3543.46s]  He seemed to like that.
[3544.26s -> 3546.74s]  Try feeding him some more. I'll be back later.
[3547.54s -> 3553.78s]  Oh, no. Now he is insufferable. Just lust for food.
[3557.56s -> 3562.71s]  Here. Play with this. See? He's like, oh.
[3565.46s -> 3568.74s]  Hey, good job. Here.
[3573.14s -> 3574.34s]  Yes. What about? What do you want?
[3575.14s -> 3578.54s]  You strong? How are you doing? You're okay.
[3579.98s -> 3580.54s]  Good boy.
[3584.14s -> 3587.16s]  I was rubbing his tummy. I was rubbing his...
[3588.95s -> 3591.19s]  I was rubbing his tummy. It said rub tummy.
[3591.75s -> 3596.23s]  It said rub tummy for food stuff.
[3601.70s -> 3602.50s]  All right. Let's go.
[3603.30s -> 3609.35s]  All right. Where's the silver scroll?
[3615.56s -> 3617.64s]  Silver reward scroll. Where was it?
[3618.84s -> 3623.02s]  I don't remember where it was.
[3630.62s -> 3634.22s]  Oh, fuck. Who's this motherfucker?
[3634.94s -> 3639.74s]  Oh, no. It's a rival god.
[3641.58s -> 3643.34s]  It's spying on my base.
[3643.34s -> 3644.70s]  All right. He's spying on my base.
[3651.91s -> 3654.15s]  Your creature already has his own personality.
[3658.66s -> 3659.62s]  What is his personality?
[3660.58s -> 3662.42s]  But you can alter and shape it by...
[3664.02s -> 3664.98s]  Oh, I thought he was going to eat her.
[3666.18s -> 3671.27s]  Punish your creature to stop him doing things like that.
[3671.91s -> 3674.04s]  I thought he was going to eat her.
[3674.04s -> 3675.72s]  Oh, that just gets shit out of me.
[3676.84s -> 3677.24s]  Punish.
[3685.85s -> 3688.89s]  Hold down the action button over the creature to zoom in on him.
[3691.45s -> 3695.37s]  Now, slap him by moving your hand quickly from side to side across him.
[3695.37s -> 3696.41s]  There it is. Good job.
[3708.47s -> 3710.63s]  You want to encourage him to do things like that, do you?
[3711.19s -> 3712.87s]  Well, it's up to you.
[3712.87s -> 3715.43s]  I'll return when your creature is behaving a bit better.
[3715.43s -> 3716.31s]  He's like, haha.
[3719.48s -> 3721.56s]  I can do those things. I don't even care.
[3722.52s -> 3728.28s]  You're a little weirdo, huh?
[3734.78s -> 3735.42s]  All right. Feed.
[3736.62s -> 3737.18s]  Play with your ball.
[3752.09s -> 3752.89s]  Wait. No, no, no, no.
[3752.89s -> 3754.01s]  This is the fucking...
[3754.01s -> 3755.53s]  Okay. That guy is the carver.
[3756.33s -> 3766.38s]  Okay. Let's go find another scroll.
[3767.10s -> 3771.29s]  He needs to grow up, too.
[3771.29s -> 3772.25s]  They get older, actually.
[3772.25s -> 3773.13s]  They actually grow up.
[3773.85s -> 3775.37s]  All right. How are we doing on food?
[3777.50s -> 3779.10s]  Feed him. Feed him. Feed him.
[3779.10s -> 3780.14s]  All right. Do we have any more...
[3780.78s -> 3781.18s]  Animals?
[3785.40s -> 3786.76s]  Here. I have this.
[3793.22s -> 3797.70s]  There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.
[3797.70s -> 3798.50s]  All right. Well, hold on.
[3800.12s -> 3804.36s]  Hey! Sable, the creature droid that is trying to attract our attention.
[3808.20s -> 3813.03s]  Eat. Eat.
[3814.50s -> 3817.98s]  It says rub his belly to make him want to eat.
[3821.26s -> 3828.90s]  Stop playing and eat.
[3829.94s -> 3831.30s]  You're going to lose the ball.
[3831.30s -> 3832.02s]  I'm not going to get it.
[3832.02s -> 3833.30s]  I'm not getting it for you if you lose it.
[3834.02s -> 3835.64s]  Yeah. You can't even hit it.
[3836.52s -> 3838.36s]  All right. Well...
[3841.08s -> 3845.40s]  Hey! Sable, the creature droid that is trying to attract our attention.
[3846.28s -> 3847.64s]  All right. Eat.
[3849.45s -> 3849.93s]  Eat this.
[3852.58s -> 3853.62s]  You're hungry. Eat.
[3856.12s -> 3856.76s]  Eat!
[3858.04s -> 3859.16s]  That's the stomach.
[3859.80s -> 3874.22s]  What? He thought about that.
[3874.22s -> 3875.90s]  He had like a moral conflict there.
[3875.90s -> 3876.46s]  What was that?
[3880.10s -> 3880.82s]  That was weird.
[3882.02s -> 3883.14s]  That was weird.
[3883.14s -> 3886.66s]  Sable, the creature droid that is trying to attract our attention.
[3886.66s -> 3887.70s]  Yeah. But hold on.
[3887.70s -> 3889.54s]  Where's the silver scroll on the beach?
[3890.82s -> 3892.10s]  I want to get more toys and stuff.
[3892.10s -> 3893.46s]  Is it on the beach?
[3893.46s -> 3894.26s]  What did he say it was?
[3895.22s -> 3895.70s]  There it is.
[3902.87s -> 3905.43s]  Hi, man. Neat stone circle.
[3905.43s -> 3907.19s]  It's a bummer that some are missing.
[3908.23s -> 3909.99s]  Sounds like we can help there.
[3910.95s -> 3911.59s]  What?
[3911.59s -> 3915.51s]  Help test the loaded sack of burnt-out neurons.
[3915.51s -> 3918.23s]  The stones have to play a scale.
[3918.23s -> 3919.35s]  That's what we need.
[3919.99s -> 3922.23s]  Tap a stone to hear its note.
[3922.23s -> 3926.68s]  Okay. It has to play a certain song.
[3946.65s -> 3948.81s]  Cool. Okay. Now what?
[3948.81s -> 3951.45s]  Let's find the stones to put in the stone circle.
[3954.18s -> 3955.46s]  Let's find the stones.
[3956.34s -> 3958.10s]  That's going to be a pain in the ass.
[3961.34s -> 3961.98s]  Kill that guy.
[3967.48s -> 3968.92s]  Let's find the stones.
[3969.56s -> 3970.92s]  Good luck with that shit.
[3971.64s -> 3972.28s]  I found one.
[3983.53s -> 3984.46s]  Does it play?
[3985.10s -> 3987.51s]  It's one, two, three.
[3988.47s -> 3989.27s]  One, two, three.
[3993.88s -> 3994.12s]  All right.
[3994.12s -> 3994.92s]  Well, no, I didn't.
[3994.92s -> 3995.88s]  I just have to find them.
[3995.88s -> 3996.76s]  It's not Simon Says.
[3997.96s -> 3999.40s]  I just eventually have to find them all.
[3999.40s -> 4000.28s]  All right. That's fine.
[4000.28s -> 4001.96s]  Let's go back to the scroll over here.
[4001.96s -> 4003.88s]  Wait. Find another one right here.
[4003.88s -> 4012.52s]  It's an omega symbol.
[4014.10s -> 4016.90s]  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4016.90s -> 4017.94s]  This guy's freaking me out.
[4018.74s -> 4019.70s]  Who are you?
[4019.70s -> 4020.50s]  What do you want with me?
[4021.22s -> 4022.26s]  Can I throw a boulder at him?
[4022.90s -> 4028.89s]  And what does this one say?
[4029.53s -> 4031.45s]  Silver rewards scrolls are not vital.
[4031.45s -> 4032.49s]  Yeah, I know that.
[4033.61s -> 4035.54s]  You can throw in different ways.
[4035.54s -> 4038.90s]  A long smooth throw sends the missile low along the ground
[4038.90s -> 4041.54s]  and a quick hand move release will throw the object higher.
[4041.54s -> 4044.07s]  Yeah. All right.
[4044.07s -> 4044.63s]  Let's go do this.
[4047.82s -> 4049.50s]  It's time to take him for a walk.
[4049.50s -> 4049.82s]  Okay.
[4052.70s -> 4054.70s]  This is the leash of learning.
[4054.70s -> 4055.74s]  Please click on it
[4055.74s -> 4057.90s]  and I'll show you how to use it with your creature.
[4057.90s -> 4060.62s]  He's going to like stuff it on people and shit, isn't he?
[4061.58s -> 4064.49s]  All right. Here we go.
[4064.49s -> 4066.49s]  Good. Now click on your creature.
[4069.11s -> 4071.51s]  Now you've got some direct control of the little beast.
[4071.91s -> 4072.55s]  On a leash.
[4074.65s -> 4075.85s]  You didn't wait. Where's this other pig?
[4076.41s -> 4078.25s]  You can pull the creature about with the leash.
[4080.65s -> 4081.85s]  You see that tree over there?
[4083.86s -> 4084.18s]  Yeah.
[4084.82s -> 4086.66s]  Try pulling your creature towards it.
[4086.66s -> 4089.22s]  Click the action button on the ground to hurry him up.
[4089.22s -> 4089.54s]  Okay.
[4092.86s -> 4093.82s]  So let's go.
[4099.32s -> 4099.88s]  Come over here.
[4104.47s -> 4105.03s]  Good work.
[4105.83s -> 4110.14s]  You got it. Very well done.
[4111.10s -> 4112.46s]  Excellent. Well done.
[4113.10s -> 4114.78s]  Did you know that you can use a leash
[4114.78s -> 4116.62s]  to make your creature interact with objects?
[4116.62s -> 4119.26s]  Oh, I can try getting him to pick up that cow over there.
[4120.54s -> 4121.82s]  He loves picking up.
[4121.82s -> 4125.98s]  Wait, that's a hand with the leash over the cow.
[4125.98s -> 4127.42s]  Then click the action button.
[4129.74s -> 4135.42s]  Uh, yes, she will be doing this.
[4136.30s -> 4136.86s]  I didn't have to.
[4140.94s -> 4143.82s]  Well done. You see the leash is very useful.
[4145.82s -> 4146.70s]  It'll do him good.
[4147.34s -> 4150.62s]  You can drop the leash by shaking your hand left and right quickly.
[4150.62s -> 4151.26s]  He's like, bye.
[4153.78s -> 4154.50s]  Shake your hand.
[4154.50s -> 4154.82s]  Okay.
[4155.54s -> 4156.73s]  What do you want to do?
[4157.77s -> 4158.81s]  All right. Let's go for a walk.
[4159.53s -> 4166.38s]  Let's go for a walk through town.
[4168.68s -> 4179.50s]  Take him to the sheep.
[4179.50s -> 4180.86s]  No, look at how small he is.
[4180.86s -> 4182.14s]  Do you see how big the sheep was?
[4182.70s -> 4183.18s]  Wait a minute.
[4183.90s -> 4184.78s]  Holy fuck.
[4185.66s -> 4188.73s]  The sheep is like 500 times his size.
[4191.27s -> 4193.03s]  Uh, I don't think he's...
[4193.03s -> 4194.47s]  I'm not, I'm not going over there.
[4200.89s -> 4201.53s]  Let's go in here.
[4206.76s -> 4207.64s]  It's a friend.
[4207.64s -> 4209.16s]  I highly doubt that shit.
[4211.14s -> 4211.70s]  All right, let's go.
[4212.98s -> 4218.18s]  Look, everybody's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.
[4218.18s -> 4219.14s]  Look who's here.
[4219.14s -> 4220.18s]  Look, he's getting smarter.
[4220.18s -> 4221.78s]  He's like, whoa, these people.
[4223.53s -> 4224.89s]  What is this stuff?
[4229.16s -> 4231.62s]  Oh, who's just chasing them around?
[4233.74s -> 4235.26s]  Just let him, let him, let him learn.
[4235.26s -> 4242.89s]  Let him think he's getting, yes, that's a person.
[4242.89s -> 4243.37s]  That's correct.
[4244.33s -> 4245.45s]  He's getting brain power.
[4246.17s -> 4247.53s]  Are they all running away scared?
[4248.25s -> 4249.85s]  I don't think so.
[4250.49s -> 4252.58s]  Where's he going?
[4253.38s -> 4254.74s]  Where are you going?
[4255.38s -> 4257.75s]  What is he doing?
[4257.75s -> 4259.59s]  He's, oh, he's just running around the perimeter.
[4265.11s -> 4266.47s]  Uh, all right, all right.
[4266.47s -> 4268.95s]  You don't, you really don't need to do laps around the building.
[4269.67s -> 4270.39s]  But maybe you do.
[4271.19s -> 4277.91s]  What is he doing?
[4280.17s -> 4281.77s]  He's getting exercise.
[4281.77s -> 4282.81s]  He's doing cardio.
[4282.81s -> 4294.95s]  He's going to get big and strong and he needs to do his cardio laps.
[4294.95s -> 4295.75s]  Give him a name.
[4296.47s -> 4297.27s]  I don't know yet.
[4297.27s -> 4298.07s]  Let's see.
[4298.07s -> 4300.65s]  Ooh, what happened?
[4301.37s -> 4302.81s]  Oh, I, he, oh, I deletion.
[4303.45s -> 4311.22s]  Oh, he wants to go home.
[4311.22s -> 4311.62s]  Okay.
[4311.62s -> 4312.26s]  All right, we'll go home.
[4315.54s -> 4316.42s]  Will he eat trees?
[4317.22s -> 4320.07s]  Hold on.
[4320.07s -> 4320.87s]  What can I get?
[4320.87s -> 4321.27s]  Hunger.
[4321.27s -> 4321.67s]  He's hungry.
[4321.67s -> 4322.23s]  He's tired.
[4322.87s -> 4329.77s]  He doesn't, he's not going to eat wood.
[4330.65s -> 4333.66s]  Yeah, you're doing great.
[4333.66s -> 4333.90s]  Okay.
[4334.94s -> 4336.14s]  What about like just trees?
[4337.91s -> 4338.55s]  Will he eat this?
[4340.44s -> 4340.68s]  Here.
[4345.03s -> 4349.11s]  Do you eat trees?
[4349.11s -> 4355.96s]  Oh, I guess this is, oh, oh, wait, hold on.
[4357.00s -> 4362.95s]  Hey, I guess you don't like it.
[4362.95s -> 4363.51s]  Okay.
[4363.51s -> 4364.87s]  I'll get, I'll, I'll get rid of it.
[4364.87s -> 4365.19s]  All right.
[4365.19s -> 4365.59s]  All right.
[4365.59s -> 4365.99s]  Jesus.
[4366.63s -> 4369.45s]  He thinks he's so funny.
[4369.45s -> 4369.93s]  That's fine.
[4376.63s -> 4381.05s]  He's spoiled.
[4381.05s -> 4382.97s]  There's more to learn about leashes.
[4383.05s -> 4386.09s]  I didn't tell you that you can attach the leash to objects.
[4386.09s -> 4387.85s]  Try leashing the creature to this tree.
[4387.85s -> 4389.13s]  Make it so he can't go anywhere.
[4391.22s -> 4394.02s]  With the leash attached to your hand, move it over the tree.
[4395.86s -> 4396.18s]  Okay.
[4397.14s -> 4402.22s]  Double click the action button to attach the leash.
[4402.86s -> 4409.35s]  Attach your creature to the sparkly tree.
[4410.71s -> 4411.43s]  What did he do?
[4411.43s -> 4411.91s]  Did he eat?
[4426.62s -> 4430.30s]  With the leash attached to your creature, double click on the tree.
[4430.30s -> 4431.50s]  Why did he do that?
[4431.50s -> 4434.14s]  Double click the action button to attach the leash.
[4434.14s -> 4435.34s]  It wasn't funny.
[4435.34s -> 4436.14s]  It's not funny.
[4436.14s -> 4436.78s]  It is funny.
[4436.78s -> 4437.10s]  Fuck it.
[4437.10s -> 4437.50s]  Who cares?
[4438.14s -> 4441.02s]  Like he leaned out and did this like dance.
[4441.02s -> 4441.42s]  Okay.
[4441.42s -> 4441.82s]  Whatever.
[4446.15s -> 4446.87s]  Good.
[4446.87s -> 4448.71s]  The leash is very useful.
[4448.71s -> 4450.39s]  Your creature is tied to the tree now.
[4450.95s -> 4453.19s]  You interact with whatever his leash to as well.
[4454.95s -> 4457.83s]  If you click on a leash when the creature is attached to something,
[4457.83s -> 4459.03s]  you can adjust its length.
[4460.15s -> 4463.03s]  I didn't, that was, he did it like four times in a row.
[4463.83s -> 4465.75s]  This is the leash of aggression.
[4465.75s -> 4467.83s]  It encourages your creature to get angry.
[4470.95s -> 4473.43s]  This is the fluffy leash of compassion.
[4473.43s -> 4475.27s]  It makes your creature behave nicely.
[4477.11s -> 4479.43s]  Why not experiment with these leashes?
[4479.43s -> 4480.63s]  They're powerful tools.
[4481.19s -> 4482.71s]  I'll bid you farewell.
[4482.71s -> 4484.95s]  You now know as much about creatures as I do.
[4487.43s -> 4490.07s]  Legends tell of an ancient creature somewhere on this land.
[4490.07s -> 4492.39s]  We've seen him already, but I've never seen him.
[4492.95s -> 4494.47s]  He hides from us humans,
[4494.47s -> 4496.07s]  but he has great knowledge, I think.
[4496.07s -> 4496.95s]  It's a giant sheep.
[4499.75s -> 4500.39s]  Hey, Mini Clips.
[4500.39s -> 4501.19s]  Thanks for the five subs.
[4501.19s -> 4501.59s]  Appreciate it.
[4503.90s -> 4504.78s]  It's the sniper.
[4509.24s -> 4512.44s]  There are advanced techniques for using the leash.
[4512.44s -> 4514.04s]  Find them on this signpost.
[4516.68s -> 4517.64s]  No, you can't go that way.
[4518.90s -> 4519.22s]  All right.
[4522.12s -> 4522.52s]  Don't do it.
[4523.70s -> 4525.14s]  Oh my fucking god, he ate her.
[4539.70s -> 4541.22s]  Can we not get quests anymore?
[4544.57s -> 4545.37s]  That was bad.
[4547.22s -> 4548.50s]  No, that wasn't good.
[4548.50s -> 4549.38s]  Not funny.
[4549.38s -> 4550.02s]  Not funny.
[4550.02s -> 4550.66s]  Don't do that.
[4552.18s -> 4553.06s]  Not funny.
[4553.86s -> 4554.66s]  Here, let me just...
[4556.26s -> 4557.06s]  I don't want to...
[4558.26s -> 4558.82s]  Is there any way?
[4558.82s -> 4559.70s]  Can I scold him?
[4560.82s -> 4564.25s]  How do you scold?
[4564.25s -> 4564.65s]  I don't want to...
[4565.69s -> 4569.05s]  There's only one way you can do that.
[4569.05s -> 4570.41s]  It's like, all right, he's...
[4572.39s -> 4573.99s]  He's going to start to become unbearable.
[4573.99s -> 4574.47s]  You know what I mean?
[4574.47s -> 4576.55s]  Like he's going to eat quest givers and shit.
[4576.55s -> 4577.91s]  I don't know if we can handle this.
[4580.15s -> 4580.63s]  Don't do that.
[4580.63s -> 4581.67s]  Let's stop.
[4581.67s -> 4581.91s]  I'm...
[4582.31s -> 4582.47s]  I'm...
[4584.90s -> 4588.10s]  Okay, I just didn't...
[4588.10s -> 4588.98s]  All right, all right, all right.
[4589.86s -> 4590.58s]  Oh, fuck.
[4591.30s -> 4593.78s]  Oh, I don't want to do that.
[4593.78s -> 4594.26s]  All right.
[4594.26s -> 4596.66s]  You can restrict the area in which your creature...
[4600.17s -> 4601.37s]  Jesus Christ.
[4613.58s -> 4615.10s]  First, what is he doing?
[4617.66s -> 4620.22s]  You can restrict the area in which your creature can move when he's on the leash.
[4620.22s -> 4622.22s]  First, you attach the leash to an object and...
[4622.22s -> 4624.30s]  Okay, that's area restricted.
[4628.20s -> 4629.88s]  He's thinking about...
[4629.88s -> 4630.20s]  What?
[4633.80s -> 4636.28s]  Look, this motherfucker just ain't the quest giver.
[4636.28s -> 4636.60s]  Okay?
[4645.77s -> 4647.05s]  All right, click on...
[4647.85s -> 4648.41s]  Click on...
[4648.41s -> 4649.05s]  All right, we're fine.
[4649.61s -> 4650.41s]  Pull to stretch the...
[4650.41s -> 4651.77s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4651.77s -> 4653.13s]  First, you attach the leash to an object
[4653.13s -> 4655.13s]  and click the action button anymore on the leash to pick it up.
[4655.13s -> 4655.69s]  Okay.
[4655.69s -> 4658.49s]  You can pull to stretch the leash to the length you want it to be.
[4659.29s -> 4659.69s]  I see.
[4661.18s -> 4662.22s]  So you can do...
[4662.22s -> 4663.10s]  Okay, that makes sense.
[4663.90s -> 4664.86s]  All right, let's go find...
[4665.98s -> 4667.50s]  You're encouraging him to eat people.
[4671.50s -> 4673.66s]  You're fucking fused.
[4675.10s -> 4679.69s]  I was fucked up the second she was done talking.
[4684.18s -> 4688.06s]  Did you know the creature pen is where you'll find your creature's leashes?
[4688.06s -> 4691.34s]  You can also use different leashes to directly influence your creature's mood.
[4692.30s -> 4697.50s]  There is the leash of learning, which makes your creature mimic your own action.
[4698.06s -> 4702.14s]  The leash of aggression, which will make him angry and the leash of compassion.
[4702.14s -> 4703.42s]  So he's on the leash of learning right now.
[4703.42s -> 4703.66s]  Okay.
[4704.30s -> 4705.42s]  Does he want to sleep out there?
[4705.42s -> 4706.30s]  Let's get rid of the leash.
[4714.89s -> 4716.01s]  Go to bed.
[4716.01s -> 4723.78s]  How does he have to have that, like, big ass bruise?
[4723.78s -> 4725.46s]  Like, I didn't even want to do that.
[4726.50s -> 4727.54s]  All right.
[4727.54s -> 4728.10s]  Go to bed.
[4732.65s -> 4733.05s]  Good.
[4733.05s -> 4733.69s]  Okay.
[4733.69s -> 4739.56s]  So I got the leash of learning on right now.
[4739.56s -> 4739.88s]  All right.
[4740.76s -> 4741.16s]  Here we go.
[4741.16s -> 4745.88s]  There's a silver reward squirrel on the beach behind those huge gates.
[4745.88s -> 4746.60s]  I know.
[4746.60s -> 4748.84s]  There's a bunch of reward squirrels everywhere.
[4748.84s -> 4749.72s]  There's one here, too.
[4750.92s -> 4753.48s]  Remember, he ate a person.
[4753.48s -> 4753.88s]  I know.
[4755.00s -> 4756.44s]  It was an important person, too.
[4760.82s -> 4763.46s]  By the great gods, I've been asleep.
[4763.46s -> 4766.26s]  I was just counting my sheep when I dozed off.
[4767.74s -> 4769.26s]  Please find my strange sheep.
[4776.73s -> 4779.29s]  Well, they were going to be slaughtered anyway.
[4779.29s -> 4782.49s]  I say we waste the wandering mutton.
[4782.49s -> 4786.57s]  But if we find and return them, we'll have a diet in the wolf follower.
[4787.13s -> 4787.69s]  Wow.
[4787.69s -> 4789.53s]  The saintly one made a joke.
[4790.57s -> 4793.86s]  What is that?
[4793.86s -> 4794.34s]  Ooh.
[4794.34s -> 4794.66s]  Okay.
[4794.66s -> 4795.86s]  So we're going to find you sheep.
[4798.84s -> 4802.78s]  Found one.
[4802.78s -> 4803.34s]  Here.
[4803.34s -> 4804.22s]  Is this what you're looking for?
[4804.94s -> 4806.60s]  There's one right there, right?
[4807.99s -> 4809.51s]  Many thanks, higher power.
[4809.51s -> 4810.55s]  Keep them coming, please.
[4811.43s -> 4813.74s]  Well, it's your problem.
[4813.74s -> 4814.54s]  This is your problem.
[4817.93s -> 4818.57s]  What is this place?
[4819.45s -> 4824.09s]  Did you know children stay safely in the creche until they reach adulthood?
[4824.09s -> 4825.29s]  The creche is a settlement.
[4825.29s -> 4827.61s]  It encourages people to have more children.
[4827.61s -> 4827.85s]  All right.
[4827.85s -> 4829.85s]  So this is like a little daycare.
[4830.65s -> 4833.75s]  All right.
[4833.75s -> 4834.31s]  Makes sense.
[4835.90s -> 4839.50s]  If you drop a person by a job, they'll become a disciple and do that job indefinitely
[4839.50s -> 4842.54s]  until you stop them by picking them up and shaking your hand to release them.
[4842.54s -> 4842.78s]  Okay.
[4844.92s -> 4846.68s]  You create as many disciples as you like.
[4849.38s -> 4851.62s]  Shake your hand when you've got the leash and you release it, right?
[4851.62s -> 4856.10s]  You can leash your creature to any object by double clicking the action button on the object.
[4856.10s -> 4859.30s]  Pressing this key leashes attaches the leash to your creature.
[4859.30s -> 4859.94s]  Right.
[4859.94s -> 4860.74s]  Oh, what are you doing?
[4865.91s -> 4866.71s]  Why are you going over here?
[4873.03s -> 4874.23s]  Not over by the children.
[4875.03s -> 4875.99s]  Not by the children.
[4875.99s -> 4876.71s]  He's on the loose.
[4877.35s -> 4883.72s]  What's he doing?
[4883.72s -> 4885.40s]  He's just like sprinting around.
[4886.95s -> 4889.91s]  He's completely, completely out of control.
[4890.79s -> 4895.30s]  I mean, he's not doing it.
[4896.10s -> 4899.26s]  He's all right here.
[4902.57s -> 4903.13s]  Stay over here.
[4904.60s -> 4905.40s]  Just like relax.
[4906.60s -> 4907.16s]  Just chill.
[4912.82s -> 4913.86s]  He's the worst.
[4914.42s -> 4915.94s]  He's really, really the worst.
[4917.74s -> 4918.14s]  All right.
[4918.14s -> 4920.22s]  Just don't kill anybody please while I'm doing this.
[4920.86s -> 4921.10s]  All right.
[4921.10s -> 4921.74s]  Look at the sheep.
[4922.79s -> 4923.59s]  How are you doing actually?
[4925.67s -> 4931.02s]  He wanted to kick down.
[4931.74s -> 4932.46s]  Stay.
[4932.46s -> 4932.96s]  No.
[4934.98s -> 4936.66s]  Stop.
[4939.29s -> 4940.97s]  He's just shitting.
[4942.09s -> 4942.73s]  Stop.
[4942.73s -> 4943.13s]  Stop.
[4943.13s -> 4943.61s]  Stop.
[4943.61s -> 4944.41s]  Stay back here.
[4946.55s -> 4947.05s]  Stay.
[4948.55s -> 4949.19s]  Don't move.
[4951.10s -> 4951.60s]  No.
[4953.34s -> 4953.84s]  Relax.
[4959.13s -> 4959.53s]  Don't.
[4959.53s -> 4961.13s]  Just quit being such an asshole.
[4961.85s -> 4962.73s]  Did I do this to you?
[4963.45s -> 4964.07s]  All right.
[4964.07s -> 4964.31s]  All right.
[4964.31s -> 4964.55s]  All right.
[4964.55s -> 4964.79s]  All right.
[4964.79s -> 4966.39s]  I gotta find video over here.
[4966.39s -> 4966.89s]  Sheep and...
[4973.05s -> 4973.80s]  Okay.
[4973.80s -> 4974.76s]  We need to make some jobs.
[4976.73s -> 4977.21s]  Uh, you...
[4977.77s -> 4980.02s]  Let's have you be...
[4982.18s -> 4982.74s]  Uh, okay.
[4982.74s -> 4983.94s]  Disciple Breeder.
[4984.50s -> 4985.30s]  Some breeding maybe?
[4986.81s -> 4988.01s]  Disciple Breeder.
[4994.58s -> 4995.86s]  He just killed somebody.
[4996.42s -> 5000.66s]  There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.
[5001.46s -> 5015.03s]  Where are you going?
[5017.06s -> 5018.90s]  I don't even know what to do with you anymore.
[5019.70s -> 5024.28s]  Oh, he was thirsty.
[5028.70s -> 5029.02s]  All right.
[5029.82s -> 5030.54s]  Please be good.
[5034.57s -> 5034.81s]  All right.
[5034.81s -> 5035.13s]  All right.
[5035.13s -> 5035.37s]  All right.
[5035.37s -> 5035.61s]  All right.
[5035.61s -> 5035.85s]  All right.
[5035.85s -> 5036.81s]  All right.
[5037.70s -> 5038.82s]  I can't attach you to this.
[5039.46s -> 5040.18s]  Just stay over here.
[5041.45s -> 5042.17s]  Just look.
[5042.17s -> 5042.89s]  Play with your ball.
[5042.89s -> 5043.13s]  See?
[5044.01s -> 5044.81s]  Cool, huh?
[5044.81s -> 5045.21s]  Good.
[5045.21s -> 5045.45s]  All right.
[5045.45s -> 5046.65s]  Now let me continue the game, please.
[5050.06s -> 5050.30s]  All right.
[5050.30s -> 5051.34s]  We got sheep for you.
[5051.34s -> 5052.30s]  There's another one over here.
[5054.15s -> 5054.95s]  There was another scroll.
[5054.95s -> 5055.51s]  Where was it?
[5056.39s -> 5056.55s]  Okay.
[5056.55s -> 5057.35s]  There's this right here.
[5062.86s -> 5065.18s]  There's a huge creature in the valley beyond.
[5067.16s -> 5068.84s]  We're all terrified.
[5069.96s -> 5073.00s]  This must be the creature that Sable spoke of.
[5073.00s -> 5074.20s]  Let's investigate.
[5075.61s -> 5075.93s]  Okay.
[5077.03s -> 5077.43s]  Mm-hmm.
[5082.76s -> 5084.84s]  Look at the size of that.
[5085.72s -> 5086.76s]  Ah, okay.
[5086.76s -> 5087.80s]  We're dead.
[5087.80s -> 5089.08s]  We're all dead.
[5089.08s -> 5089.56s]  He's gonna come get us.
[5089.56s -> 5090.52s]  What is it?
[5090.52s -> 5091.80s]  Where is it from?
[5091.80s -> 5094.20s]  It doesn't seem to be aggressive, though.
[5094.20s -> 5096.36s]  If it is, we're all dead.
[5096.36s -> 5097.56s]  Even our spirits.
[5097.56s -> 5098.04s]  Dead.
[5098.04s -> 5098.84s]  You too, boss.
[5100.52s -> 5102.28s]  Pick up a rock and throw it at it.
[5102.28s -> 5102.60s]  It's dead.
[5102.60s -> 5104.68s]  This giant is communicating.
[5104.68s -> 5106.36s]  It's telepathic.
[5106.36s -> 5107.88s]  You have a creature.
[5107.88s -> 5108.68s]  Bring him to me.
[5109.32s -> 5110.04s]  Oh, no.
[5110.04s -> 5111.24s]  No way.
[5111.24s -> 5112.36s]  He'll eat him.
[5112.36s -> 5114.76s]  But this giant looks friendly.
[5114.76s -> 5117.08s]  Let's bring our creature over with the leash.
[5117.08s -> 5118.92s]  I am not proud of my son.
[5118.92s -> 5121.24s]  So I don't know if I'm gonna like this.
[5121.24s -> 5124.84s]  Please use the leash to bring your creature to me.
[5130.68s -> 5132.76s]  What if he just starts farting and kicking things
[5132.76s -> 5134.28s]  and eating people in front of him?
[5134.28s -> 5135.64s]  It's gonna be really embarrassing.
[5137.67s -> 5138.55s]  There you are.
[5138.55s -> 5139.27s]  All right, come here.
[5150.17s -> 5150.89s]  Over this way.
[5154.26s -> 5155.70s]  He must be judged.
[5162.22s -> 5163.98s]  Derva hates him already.
[5163.98s -> 5164.62s]  I don't hate...
[5164.62s -> 5165.66s]  I think he's funny.
[5168.50s -> 5169.54s]  But he's not...
[5169.54s -> 5170.98s]  He's not wholesome.
[5170.98s -> 5171.70s]  He's just...
[5171.70s -> 5173.14s]  He's just mean and weird.
[5175.48s -> 5175.88s]  All right.
[5175.88s -> 5180.47s]  Please use the leash to bring your creature to me.
[5180.47s -> 5183.43s]  This is an important weird God interview.
[5183.43s -> 5184.23s]  Don't embarrass me.
[5189.58s -> 5191.34s]  I do hope they'll be friends.
[5198.87s -> 5204.78s]  Another creature?
[5204.78s -> 5205.50s]  Is it true?
[5206.06s -> 5206.94s]  Are you real?
[5207.90s -> 5209.54s]  I've been doing the same...
[5209.54s -> 5210.66s]  You're doing the same stance.
[5210.66s -> 5213.54s]  I thought I would die without ever seeing another God.
[5214.34s -> 5214.90s]  I like you.
[5214.90s -> 5216.10s]  Or another creature.
[5216.90s -> 5219.16s]  Am I mocking him with this person?
[5219.16s -> 5220.12s]  I don't understand.
[5220.12s -> 5223.56s]  I once belonged to Nemesis, the most powerful of gods.
[5224.84s -> 5226.92s]  But his power kept growing
[5226.92s -> 5229.00s]  and soon I wasn't old enough for him.
[5230.52s -> 5233.80s]  So I was cast out, banished here
[5233.80s -> 5235.56s]  and I've been alone ever since.
[5237.08s -> 5237.64s]  Until now.
[5238.36s -> 5239.24s]  Well, you just...
[5239.24s -> 5239.96s]  I'm not...
[5239.96s -> 5241.00s]  I'm not hiring.
[5241.72s -> 5245.48s]  This being is astonishing, but what a sad tale.
[5245.48s -> 5249.08s]  In return for your friendship and that of your creature,
[5249.08s -> 5250.44s]  I will teach you both.
[5251.90s -> 5253.98s]  You will both learn the ways of the gods.
[5257.61s -> 5259.85s]  When you are ready for the first lesson,
[5259.85s -> 5261.77s]  meet me at the village through this pass.
[5261.77s -> 5262.73s]  There's another village.
[5268.55s -> 5269.99s]  He's like, wait, where are you going?
[5280.14s -> 5281.34s]  I want to go see the big guy again.
[5284.66s -> 5285.54s]  I'm gonna let him do it.
[5285.54s -> 5286.18s]  He needs to learn.
[5286.18s -> 5287.14s]  He's got to be on his own.
[5295.51s -> 5296.63s]  He's so dopey.
[5305.26s -> 5306.94s]  Should I be bringing him over here?
[5319.38s -> 5320.66s]  Maybe I shouldn't even be doing this.
[5325.18s -> 5327.74s]  Derma, I fucking hate this cow so much.
[5329.50s -> 5334.06s]  Well, I'm sorry, but this is our child right now.
[5334.06s -> 5336.14s]  So it's too bad.
[5336.86s -> 5345.38s]  Wait, you don't want to go over there?
[5345.38s -> 5346.10s]  No, no, no, no.
[5346.10s -> 5346.82s]  Come on, let's go.
[5348.78s -> 5351.56s]  Follow me.
[5351.56s -> 5352.04s]  There he is.
[5352.04s -> 5352.92s]  All right, now let's learn.
[5357.26s -> 5365.64s]  This cow is better than bugleberry.
[5365.64s -> 5367.88s]  Oh boy, I can see that.
[5368.52s -> 5369.94s]  All right, here we are.
[5373.05s -> 5375.37s]  This is the Aztec village.
[5375.37s -> 5378.09s]  I will teach you the first secret here.
[5378.09s -> 5379.53s]  It's not going to be like burn it down.
[5379.53s -> 5382.49s]  These people do not yet believe in you as a god.
[5383.61s -> 5386.66s]  To grow in power, you and your creature
[5386.66s -> 5389.06s]  can impress them until they believe in you.
[5389.86s -> 5393.08s]  Look at the village store.
[5393.08s -> 5395.64s]  The flag shows that they need food.
[5395.72s -> 5396.22s]  Hmm.
[5396.92s -> 5400.04s]  If you give them some, they'll think it's a miracle
[5400.04s -> 5401.72s]  and will believe in you more.
[5403.08s -> 5407.16s]  They call the signpost to find out more about desire flags.
[5407.16s -> 5408.68s]  Yeah, they need food and yeah.
[5409.56s -> 5411.16s]  All right, I got some extra food.
[5412.28s -> 5422.42s]  Imagine if the cow just turned over and picked him up.
[5422.42s -> 5423.78s]  This is a food miracle.
[5423.78s -> 5425.94s]  You can cast one food miracle.
[5426.58s -> 5430.02s]  You can pick up such one shot miracles with the action button
[5430.02s -> 5436.71s]  and activate them by tapping them with the same button like this.
[5446.97s -> 5447.85s]  What animal is that?
[5448.89s -> 5453.37s]  I hear that all the time in random animal sounds.
[5453.37s -> 5456.09s]  Things like this really impress the creatures.
[5457.37s -> 5460.73s]  If your creature is on the road, he will learn this miracle.
[5460.73s -> 5462.33s]  I need to know exactly what that animal is.
[5463.61s -> 5468.20s]  I hear it all the time.
[5468.92s -> 5471.24s]  If your creature is on the rope leash,
[5471.24s -> 5473.48s]  he'll learn this miracle when you cast it.
[5474.36s -> 5477.58s]  All right, so this is the teaching one.
[5477.58s -> 5481.26s]  Tap on the miracle and click the action button on the Aztec village store.
[5481.82s -> 5484.46s]  Okay, let's get a leash on you so you learn this.
[5486.55s -> 5487.05s]  Yes.
[5489.72s -> 5492.76s]  You picked up the miracle instead of tapping it.
[5492.76s -> 5494.20s]  Drop it and try again.
[5508.20s -> 5509.32s]  Well done.
[5509.40s -> 5512.36s]  Now click the action button over the village store.
[5512.36s -> 5513.24s]  I can't be on a leash.
[5513.24s -> 5514.36s]  Didn't it say if he's on a leash?
[5515.80s -> 5519.51s]  I thought it said he'll learn if he's on a leash.
[5520.15s -> 5521.38s]  Come here.
[5522.26s -> 5523.22s]  Get over here.
[5523.22s -> 5524.26s]  Stop chasing stuff.
[5525.06s -> 5525.46s]  What is that?
[5525.46s -> 5526.34s]  Is it a bird?
[5526.34s -> 5527.30s]  Oh, he's eating.
[5527.30s -> 5528.18s]  Okay, he's eating things.
[5528.98s -> 5532.66s]  Come here.
[5532.66s -> 5533.78s]  No, stop sleeping.
[5533.78s -> 5534.66s]  Why are you sleeping?
[5536.26s -> 5538.26s]  I just casted the miracle on the ground.
[5538.26s -> 5539.30s]  Well done.
[5539.30s -> 5541.70s]  Now click the action button over the village store.
[5541.70s -> 5543.14s]  I'm trying to get him to move.
[5544.02s -> 5544.66s]  Get over here.
[5544.66s -> 5545.14s]  Let's go.
[5550.98s -> 5552.34s]  What an embarrassment.
[5558.94s -> 5559.42s]  All right.
[5559.42s -> 5559.90s]  They believe.
[5560.94s -> 5561.82s]  That's a lot more.
[5561.82s -> 5562.62s]  Never mind.
[5562.62s -> 5566.65s]  Look at him.
[5566.65s -> 5567.37s]  Look at Adam.
[5567.37s -> 5567.77s]  Good.
[5567.77s -> 5568.81s]  He's like sizing him up.
[5572.87s -> 5576.15s]  I have created more food miracles for you to practice with.
[5577.45s -> 5581.05s]  At the village center, you can see your symbol.
[5581.05s -> 5585.53s]  When it reaches the stone hand there, the village will believe in you.
[5585.53s -> 5586.81s]  My symbol?
[5586.81s -> 5590.97s]  Holding your hand over it shows how much belief the people have in you.
[5592.33s -> 5593.85s]  I need sleep.
[5593.85s -> 5598.49s]  Wake me when the village believes in you and you are ready to continue your education.
[5598.49s -> 5598.73s]  Okay.
[5599.77s -> 5600.89s]  When it reaches the stone.
[5600.89s -> 5601.13s]  All right.
[5601.13s -> 5601.53s]  Cool.
[5601.53s -> 5602.57s]  So let's make them believe.
[5604.09s -> 5607.18s]  He just lies on the ground over here.
[5607.90s -> 5608.14s]  All right.
[5608.14s -> 5609.10s]  Should I drop a rock in his head?
[5609.82s -> 5610.06s]  All right.
[5610.06s -> 5612.14s]  I'm going to throw a huge rock and drop it on his head.
[5612.14s -> 5612.78s]  Should I do that?
[5614.62s -> 5614.94s]  All right.
[5614.94s -> 5615.50s]  Let them sleep.
[5616.14s -> 5619.62s]  They can just hang out.
[5620.74s -> 5622.02s]  I'm going to do some more food miracles.
[5624.07s -> 5630.66s]  X will worship you now.
[5632.10s -> 5636.18s]  You have not investigated many silver reward scrolls, leader.
[5636.18s -> 5637.14s]  Try a few.
[5637.14s -> 5637.86s]  It'll be worth it.
[5637.86s -> 5639.22s]  You really want me to do the side quests.
[5639.22s -> 5639.78s]  I know you do.
[5641.40s -> 5641.88s]  Hold on.
[5641.88s -> 5653.94s]  All right.
[5653.94s -> 5654.82s]  They believe in me now.
[5654.82s -> 5655.06s]  Good.
[5656.18s -> 5660.18s]  Villages are impressed by the actions of gods, especially when they fulfill the people's desires.
[5660.90s -> 5664.10s]  Do impressive things like throwing objects around, use creatures in the village,
[5664.10s -> 5664.98s]  and cast miracles.
[5664.98s -> 5665.46s]  You'll see.
[5666.66s -> 5668.34s]  You will see the belief in.
[5669.54s -> 5671.05s]  All right.
[5671.05s -> 5671.61s]  Let's get some.
[5672.41s -> 5673.05s]  Let's get some.
[5674.58s -> 5675.70s]  Disciple builder.
[5676.42s -> 5676.90s]  Builder.
[5677.94s -> 5679.30s]  Disciple forester.
[5680.26s -> 5681.62s]  Disciple forester.
[5681.62s -> 5681.86s]  All right.
[5681.86s -> 5682.34s]  Let's have some.
[5682.98s -> 5684.18s]  How many people live in this village?
[5684.18s -> 5684.66s]  Can I tell?
[5685.86s -> 5687.38s]  This is the village center.
[5687.38s -> 5690.74s]  Placing your hand over it will show how much belief is needed before the village is yours.
[5691.70s -> 5694.74s]  As you do impressive things in the village, you will see numbers come up over the villager.
[5694.74s -> 5697.46s]  This is the amount of belief you have gained for your actions.
[5697.46s -> 5697.94s]  That's right.
[5698.50s -> 5700.82s]  I need 199 belief before this village is mine.
[5701.86s -> 5703.94s]  So where'd he go?
[5706.38s -> 5706.86s]  Where'd he go?
[5724.34s -> 5727.22s]  Where is he?
[5733.37s -> 5733.61s]  Oh.
[5736.26s -> 5739.88s]  How do I locate my creature?
[5740.52s -> 5741.24s]  Did he go home?
[5746.46s -> 5751.66s]  There's a silver reward for on the beach behind those huge gifts.
[5751.66s -> 5752.38s]  Where did he go?
[5755.11s -> 5756.63s]  He took off and ran away.
[5757.43s -> 5759.59s]  Oh, there he is.
[5760.55s -> 5760.79s]  Okay.
[5760.79s -> 5761.03s]  Yeah.
[5761.03s -> 5761.51s]  Press C.
[5762.47s -> 5764.87s]  How you doing?
[5764.87s -> 5765.27s]  You good?
[5768.74s -> 5769.54s]  Good?
[5769.54s -> 5769.78s]  Good.
[5772.02s -> 5776.17s]  Be a good boy.
[5777.19s -> 5778.87s]  Go do something.
[5779.83s -> 5780.23s]  All right.
[5780.23s -> 5781.91s]  Let me get this squirrel over here.
[5782.71s -> 5783.96s]  What is this?
[5784.92s -> 5786.49s]  What's all the fuss?
[5787.21s -> 5792.55s]  A freak wave has just struck.
[5792.55s -> 5794.71s]  My husband and four others are drowning.
[5794.71s -> 5795.67s]  Please help them.
[5795.67s -> 5796.07s]  Uh-oh.
[5797.27s -> 5798.26s]  Drowning.
[5799.56s -> 5800.04s]  Let's see.
[5800.60s -> 5803.80s]  Who do we know who's tall enough to wait out to him?
[5805.32s -> 5807.27s]  Don't muck around.
[5807.27s -> 5811.03s]  Let's get our creature as fast as possible.
[5811.03s -> 5813.13s]  What do you mean our creature?
[5813.13s -> 5814.09s]  I can't just pick him up.
[5815.53s -> 5816.09s]  Oh, God.
[5816.09s -> 5816.65s]  Oh, my God.
[5816.65s -> 5817.05s]  Oh, my God.
[5817.05s -> 5818.57s]  Hey, come here.
[5819.29s -> 5819.85s]  Go help them.
[5820.73s -> 5822.01s]  This way.
[5823.37s -> 5831.19s]  Hurry up.
[5831.19s -> 5836.98s]  Go, go, go.
[5842.30s -> 5843.42s]  Oh, they're dying.
[5845.56s -> 5846.76s]  Quick to the rescue.
[5847.64s -> 5849.72s]  Go get them.
[5853.00s -> 5853.88s]  No, go.
[5855.91s -> 5856.79s]  In here.
[5858.07s -> 5858.79s]  In here.
[5861.16s -> 5862.12s]  Go in here.
[5863.16s -> 5864.20s]  Don't fall asleep.
[5864.20s -> 5864.76s]  All right.
[5864.76s -> 5865.32s]  Save them.
[5868.62s -> 5869.02s]  Get them.
[5869.74s -> 5870.14s]  Save them.
[5871.58s -> 5872.54s]  Take them out of the water.
[5873.34s -> 5874.22s]  Take them out of the water.
[5875.45s -> 5877.61s]  Take them out of the water.
[5877.61s -> 5878.89s]  Over there.
[5878.89s -> 5879.37s]  Drop them.
[5881.19s -> 5881.51s]  Drop.
[5882.63s -> 5883.03s]  Drop it.
[5885.03s -> 5885.35s]  Drop it.
[5885.35s -> 5885.51s]  All right.
[5885.51s -> 5885.91s]  Do it again.
[5890.22s -> 5894.41s]  What did he just do?
[5897.66s -> 5898.70s]  Did he just push his head under?
[5901.53s -> 5902.17s]  Quick, quick, quick.
[5905.61s -> 5906.25s]  Drop it.
[5906.25s -> 5907.08s]  Good job.
[5912.12s -> 5912.52s]  Save them.
[5915.13s -> 5915.69s]  All right.
[5915.69s -> 5916.41s]  Do it again.
[5916.41s -> 5916.81s]  Back up.
[5922.38s -> 5922.78s]  One more.
[5930.44s -> 5930.76s]  All right.
[5930.76s -> 5931.00s]  Go.
[5937.59s -> 5938.23s]  Nice job.
[5938.23s -> 5938.63s]  You did it.
[5939.19s -> 5940.63s]  You actually did something good.
[5940.63s -> 5942.15s]  I like, I'm starting to like you.
[5942.79s -> 5953.59s]  At least some survived.
[5953.59s -> 5954.95s]  We're a little thankful for that.
[5956.31s -> 5960.07s]  I'm refreshed and ready to start teaching your little creature more.
[5965.58s -> 5966.70s]  He's out of control.
[5967.34s -> 5968.22s]  I'm sorry.
[5968.22s -> 5970.46s]  There's no, I, he did, at least he did a three.
[5971.90s -> 5973.10s]  At least he did three.
[5974.38s -> 5978.70s]  He may have like snapped a person in half, but he did three out of four.
[5979.82s -> 5981.34s]  All right.
[5981.34s -> 5982.86s]  We have to go teach him some more things.
[5987.51s -> 5991.37s]  He's using the tree now.
[5991.37s -> 5992.41s]  That's actually interesting.
[5993.13s -> 5994.17s]  Why is he using the tree?
[5994.89s -> 5996.31s]  What about her?
[5996.31s -> 5996.87s]  What about him?
[5997.43s -> 5999.46s]  What's your problem?
[6000.26s -> 6001.61s]  He doesn't like you.
[6002.17s -> 6003.93s]  Why do you, you don't like, why?
[6003.93s -> 6004.73s]  What's his face?
[6005.61s -> 6006.65s]  Did you see that?
[6006.65s -> 6007.85s]  Look at that frown.
[6008.81s -> 6011.67s]  All right.
[6011.67s -> 6013.03s]  Come look up to go back to the big sheep.
[6013.59s -> 6016.57s]  He's hungry.
[6017.45s -> 6017.69s]  All right.
[6017.69s -> 6019.05s]  Well, let me get him some food.
[6026.36s -> 6027.24s]  Oh, he's going home.
[6027.24s -> 6027.40s]  All right.
[6027.40s -> 6028.44s]  Let's give him some food.
[6028.44s -> 6029.40s]  He needs to eat something.
[6030.04s -> 6035.14s]  We need like a pig or something or a sheep.
[6038.54s -> 6041.18s]  And he's just, I know I can follow him later.
[6041.18s -> 6042.38s]  He's just doing his own fucking thing.
[6042.38s -> 6043.18s]  Whatever.
[6043.18s -> 6047.42s]  There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.
[6048.78s -> 6050.86s]  We need a sheep or a cow.
[6053.74s -> 6054.06s]  All right.
[6054.06s -> 6055.02s]  Who cares about that?
[6055.02s -> 6056.46s]  We'll just feed this here.
[6060.47s -> 6066.76s]  Come here.
[6066.76s -> 6068.06s]  There.
[6068.06s -> 6069.18s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[6069.18s -> 6070.30s]  That's probably, I just heard him.
[6071.74s -> 6072.30s]  Go get this.
[6072.86s -> 6073.26s]  Come here.
[6073.98s -> 6079.85s]  He's like, oh, he doesn't know what to do.
[6079.85s -> 6083.58s]  Oh, good.
[6084.30s -> 6084.94s]  Didn't like that.
[6089.46s -> 6089.62s]  All right.
[6089.62s -> 6090.42s]  Let's go see the sheep.
[6092.17s -> 6092.49s]  Let's go.
[6093.93s -> 6099.24s]  I mean, he's a, he's a huge sheep.
[6099.24s -> 6100.04s]  You really can't miss it.
[6100.04s -> 6105.21s]  There he is.
[6105.21s -> 6106.41s]  Make him eat more people.
[6107.13s -> 6109.93s]  No, I don't want him to eat people because I don't want him to bet to be a
[6110.65s -> 6112.25s]  thing that he just does on his own.
[6112.89s -> 6114.49s]  He already, he's done it like twice.
[6126.01s -> 6126.97s]  Don't feed him meat.
[6128.62s -> 6131.02s]  That he can eat meat, but just not people.
[6131.74s -> 6136.22s]  I tried to give him a tree.
[6136.22s -> 6138.86s]  Remember he kicked it over and he looked at me and he pointed at me and laughed.
[6139.66s -> 6140.94s]  I tried to feed him a plant.
[6141.74s -> 6147.38s]  Feed him grain.
[6149.90s -> 6150.38s]  All right.
[6150.38s -> 6150.70s]  Yeah.
[6154.73s -> 6155.05s]  All right.
[6155.85s -> 6156.49s]  I see.
[6156.49s -> 6156.81s]  I see.
[6156.81s -> 6158.41s]  I mean, that's all right.
[6158.41s -> 6159.45s]  Let's learn another spell.
[6160.65s -> 6164.68s]  German doesn't know what cows eat.
[6164.68s -> 6166.92s]  This is not even a real, this is a God cow.
[6167.96s -> 6169.53s]  This is not even a cow.
[6169.53s -> 6171.13s]  This is like a God thing.
[6171.69s -> 6176.76s]  It was nemesis creature.
[6176.76s -> 6179.00s]  He often sent me into battle.
[6179.00s -> 6180.92s]  I foresee the same for you.
[6182.46s -> 6185.66s]  First, I will become your size to make things easier.
[6185.66s -> 6186.54s]  Combat training.
[6187.10s -> 6189.74s]  Be prepared to get bruised.
[6189.74s -> 6190.70s]  Don't worry.
[6190.70s -> 6192.06s]  In time, people heal.
[6195.34s -> 6196.38s]  I love the point though.
[6197.10s -> 6200.22s]  All right.
[6200.22s -> 6200.78s]  Kick his ass.
[6208.54s -> 6211.96s]  And during the time there is a fight.
[6213.35s -> 6217.27s]  You should know that your creature will fight without help from you.
[6217.35s -> 6218.07s]  He doesn't want to do it.
[6218.07s -> 6218.63s]  He's scared.
[6219.67s -> 6220.55s]  He said, no, no.
[6220.55s -> 6223.19s]  I just want to eat people and shit in bushes.
[6223.19s -> 6224.15s]  And kick balls.
[6225.03s -> 6227.58s]  All right.
[6227.58s -> 6227.98s]  Get him.
[6230.55s -> 6230.79s]  Get him.
[6230.79s -> 6232.95s]  Firstly, let's learn to attack.
[6234.31s -> 6238.23s]  Click on a part of my body using the action button to strike there.
[6239.11s -> 6243.50s]  Hit him in the head.
[6243.50s -> 6245.02s]  A good hit.
[6245.02s -> 6247.10s]  You can queue up multiple attacks as well.
[6248.49s -> 6250.81s]  Try killing up several attacks on me now.
[6252.54s -> 6253.42s]  That's right.
[6253.42s -> 6255.26s]  Now you must learn to block attacks.
[6256.63s -> 6259.75s]  Click the action button on your creature to make him block.
[6259.75s -> 6260.15s]  Block?
[6262.12s -> 6262.36s]  Yeah.
[6262.36s -> 6263.08s]  You have to block.
[6264.36s -> 6265.16s]  That's it.
[6265.16s -> 6266.20s]  A good block there.
[6267.56s -> 6269.96s]  You'll stop blocking if you do another command.
[6271.16s -> 6271.56s]  Motocombat.
[6271.56s -> 6273.48s]  Let us concentrate on dodging.
[6273.48s -> 6274.60s]  There's a dodge roll.
[6274.60s -> 6278.60s]  Click the action button anywhere on the ground to move the creature there.
[6280.33s -> 6281.05s]  That's it.
[6281.05s -> 6282.01s]  You have learned well.
[6283.21s -> 6286.66s]  Let us try some friendly combat to test these skills.
[6286.66s -> 6287.86s]  You got these hooves.
[6287.86s -> 6288.50s]  Kick him in the face.
[6288.50s -> 6289.30s]  Fucking kick him.
[6289.30s -> 6290.58s]  Just offense only.
[6290.58s -> 6291.22s]  All offense.
[6296.65s -> 6296.97s]  Oops.
[6301.82s -> 6302.86s]  How do I un-queue a move?
[6317.70s -> 6318.58s]  He's actually pretty good.
[6319.38s -> 6319.62s]  Block.
[6320.90s -> 6321.14s]  Block.
[6325.69s -> 6328.92s]  Kick.
[6329.40s -> 6330.28s]  Willstruck.
[6330.92s -> 6336.20s]  Good dodge.
[6337.56s -> 6337.80s]  Block.
[6342.58s -> 6342.82s]  Block.
[6349.00s -> 6349.72s]  Double kick.
[6349.72s -> 6350.12s]  One more.
[6350.68s -> 6351.96s]  Willstruck.
[6351.96s -> 6355.19s]  You're gonna lose to Sheepwheel.
[6356.15s -> 6357.03s]  No, you don't.
[6357.03s -> 6357.75s]  What are you talking about?
[6359.51s -> 6361.86s]  I don't think I can win.
[6361.86s -> 6362.10s]  Yeah.
[6365.90s -> 6367.82s]  That was an important lesson, friend.
[6373.72s -> 6377.08s]  You show great potential, but work on your technique.
[6381.85s -> 6382.97s]  Oh, it's because it's nighttime.
[6382.97s -> 6383.61s]  Right.
[6383.61s -> 6384.25s]  Where's he going?
[6386.25s -> 6386.89s]  No farewell?
[6386.89s -> 6387.21s]  He just...
[6387.77s -> 6397.80s]  Okay.
[6399.50s -> 6401.02s]  Oh, he just gave me power.
[6403.85s -> 6405.77s]  I have a secret for you.
[6405.77s -> 6407.37s]  But I warn you.
[6407.37s -> 6408.89s]  This knowledge is dangerous.
[6408.89s -> 6410.65s]  And you're watching the Disney Channel.
[6413.08s -> 6415.72s]  But come only when you are ready.
[6415.72s -> 6418.68s]  What I will tell you is forbidden knowledge.
[6418.68s -> 6420.76s]  Dangerous even to gods.
[6420.76s -> 6423.40s]  It's gonna be how to create tornadoes and meteors and shit.
[6423.40s -> 6426.12s]  Why don't you try out what you've learned while I sleep?
[6427.88s -> 6432.06s]  How you doing?
[6432.06s -> 6433.02s]  Hungry?
[6433.98s -> 6434.48s]  You're alright.
[6435.10s -> 6439.51s]  Alright, let's go rest up a little.
[6439.51s -> 6440.79s]  Hold on, there's another squirrel over here.
[6441.59s -> 6444.25s]  What is this?
[6454.23s -> 6455.51s]  How horrid.
[6455.51s -> 6457.03s]  I think he's trying to speak.
[6457.99s -> 6459.35s]  Is it a bat?
[6465.35s -> 6467.67s]  This ogre seems to be guarding something.
[6470.87s -> 6472.47s]  He's guarding the pass.
[6472.47s -> 6474.07s]  He's outside our influence.
[6474.07s -> 6476.31s]  So let's send our creature to fight him.
[6477.51s -> 6481.72s]  We shouldn't resort to combat with the poor thing.
[6483.26s -> 6484.14s]  He looks hungry.
[6488.33s -> 6498.68s]  You want to...
[6498.68s -> 6499.08s]  What?
[6499.08s -> 6500.04s]  You're immune to rocks?
[6512.50s -> 6513.54s]  Oh, I can't.
[6513.54s -> 6514.18s]  I can't.
[6517.22s -> 6518.34s]  Alright, where's my creature?
[6518.34s -> 6518.74s]  Let's go.
[6519.46s -> 6524.07s]  Let's get you some food and then let's have you beat this guy up.
[6525.03s -> 6526.07s]  Matter of fact, let's just do it now.
[6537.66s -> 6538.86s]  He doesn't believe in you.
[6543.62s -> 6544.12s]  So?
[6544.82s -> 6550.94s]  Is this an evil playthrough?
[6551.58s -> 6552.46s]  I don't think this is evil.
[6552.46s -> 6553.34s]  Wait, why can't I...
[6553.34s -> 6554.54s]  The creature can't go this way?
[6555.50s -> 6557.86s]  That's why the momma getting the X.
[6566.79s -> 6567.99s]  Look at how confident he is.
[6568.71s -> 6576.22s]  Uh-oh, you've got a mighty rile.
[6576.94s -> 6578.78s]  Prepare for battle, boss.
[6582.65s -> 6584.01s]  He's not gonna kick the shit out of me, right?
[6592.68s -> 6593.32s]  Uh...
[6593.32s -> 6602.60s]  Oh, fuck.
[6602.60s -> 6603.48s]  Come on, come on.
[6603.48s -> 6604.20s]  Kick him.
[6604.20s -> 6605.16s]  Kick him.
[6605.16s -> 6606.28s]  Do a move.
[6607.26s -> 6609.86s]  Alright, nice, nice, nice.
[6609.86s -> 6611.06s]  Okay, I can do this.
[6611.06s -> 6611.38s]  Block.
[6613.06s -> 6625.77s]  Again.
[6625.77s -> 6626.41s]  Offense again.
[6627.35s -> 6628.95s]  Block, block, block, block, block.
[6629.67s -> 6630.95s]  Block, block, block, block, block, block.
[6635.26s -> 6635.90s]  Nice, good.
[6637.82s -> 6640.98s]  Shit.
[6642.42s -> 6647.45s]  And dodge.
[6656.65s -> 6656.89s]  Again.
[6657.53s -> 6659.29s]  Oh, I queued up a big one too.
[6660.25s -> 6662.39s]  Right in the face.
[6665.99s -> 6666.31s]  Oh!
[6667.27s -> 6667.59s]  Block.
[6668.23s -> 6670.20s]  Lose.
[6670.92s -> 6671.48s]  Come on.
[6671.48s -> 6672.28s]  It's my fucking...
[6672.28s -> 6674.04s]  I'm going like off screen here.
[6674.20s -> 6674.52s]  Stop.
[6680.02s -> 6680.58s]  Do I die?
[6680.58s -> 6681.06s]  Do you die?
[6681.94s -> 6687.72s]  I can't even get close to him.
[6689.77s -> 6691.13s]  I can't even get fucking close to him.
[6695.00s -> 6695.96s]  What the fuck was that?
[6707.06s -> 6707.86s]  How do I run?
[6707.86s -> 6708.42s]  How do I run?
[6709.14s -> 6709.94s]  How do I run away?
[6717.37s -> 6718.57s]  Hold on, leader.
[6718.57s -> 6722.25s]  Pull back from the fight and try again when we've recovered some strength.
[6725.86s -> 6727.06s]  I'm destroyed.
[6730.57s -> 6731.88s]  Jesus.
[6733.46s -> 6735.38s]  Oh, no.
[6735.38s -> 6739.29s]  He tried.
[6747.19s -> 6748.23s]  He was trying to be...
[6748.95s -> 6750.79s]  Oh, is he dead?
[6750.79s -> 6751.67s]  He's not dead, right?
[6754.09s -> 6755.13s]  All right, you know, he's okay.
[6757.86s -> 6758.90s]  I actually just got scared.
[6758.90s -> 6760.58s]  Oh, he got the shit kicked at him.
[6760.58s -> 6761.46s]  All right, it's fine.
[6770.39s -> 6772.07s]  He was standing there like, no, I'm good.
[6772.07s -> 6772.31s]  I'm good.
[6772.31s -> 6772.63s]  Don't worry.
[6772.63s -> 6773.43s]  I'm fine.
[6773.43s -> 6773.91s]  I'm fine.
[6773.91s -> 6774.31s]  I'm fine.
[6775.43s -> 6777.51s]  Just instantly does like the Mortal Kombat.
[6777.51s -> 6780.55s]  You got kicked on the ground with zero health.
[6781.51s -> 6782.71s]  Stood up and fell back down.
[6783.35s -> 6789.51s]  That's what his eyes...
[6790.55s -> 6791.43s]  Well, this is not good.
[6792.23s -> 6794.33s]  All right, come here.
[6794.33s -> 6794.57s]  Let me...
[6795.29s -> 6796.41s]  No, Jesus Christ.
[6797.93s -> 6798.57s]  Don't get up.
[6798.57s -> 6798.81s]  Lay down.
[6798.81s -> 6799.45s]  Stay down.
[6799.45s -> 6799.77s]  Stay down.
[6799.77s -> 6800.89s]  Stay down.
[6800.89s -> 6801.72s]  Stay down.
[6801.72s -> 6802.12s]  Stay down.
[6802.12s -> 6802.52s]  Lie down.
[6806.04s -> 6809.38s]  You tried.
[6809.38s -> 6810.10s]  You really did.
[6812.36s -> 6813.72s]  Just hang out over here for a minute.
[6814.28s -> 6816.10s]  Let me get you some food.
[6818.95s -> 6823.19s]  There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.
[6824.31s -> 6824.87s]  Okay, here.
[6827.02s -> 6827.66s]  Have something to eat.
[6828.54s -> 6829.91s]  You look like...
[6829.91s -> 6830.71s]  You look skinny.
[6830.71s -> 6831.21s]  Here.
[6832.15s -> 6837.46s]  I don't like it.
[6837.46s -> 6838.74s]  He has a taste for meat now.
[6842.44s -> 6843.16s]  I actually do...
[6843.16s -> 6844.68s]  I don't want you going fucking anywhere.
[6844.68s -> 6845.18s]  Stay here.
[6847.50s -> 6848.78s]  Stay here.
[6848.78s -> 6849.98s]  How do I like attach you to...
[6849.98s -> 6850.78s]  All right, stay here.
[6851.74s -> 6852.62s]  You need to heal.
[6852.62s -> 6853.12s]  Rest up.
[6853.82s -> 6856.12s]  All right, beach.
[6856.84s -> 6863.45s]  Where was that scroll?
[6864.17s -> 6865.93s]  On the beach somewhere.
[6866.65s -> 6869.48s]  Now there's this one.
[6869.48s -> 6870.20s]  I remember that one.
[6870.76s -> 6872.65s]  What beach was it on?
[6876.97s -> 6879.37s]  All right, let's do this one.
[6879.93s -> 6886.41s]  This notion that we quite like to sail the ocean
[6886.41s -> 6890.73s]  So we're building a big boat to leave here for good
[6891.53s -> 6893.37s]  We're not keen on sinking
[6893.37s -> 6895.69s]  So we're all sitting here and thinking
[6895.69s -> 6897.77s]  Cause we built it too big
[6897.77s -> 6900.81s]  And we've run out of wood
[6900.81s -> 6902.92s]  I leave
[6902.92s -> 6909.30s]  We simply can't leave till we get some more wood
[6909.30s -> 6913.08s]  Not keen on sinking
[6913.08s -> 6915.40s]  So that's why we're sitting thinking
[6915.40s -> 6920.36s]  Cause we simply can't leave till we get some more wood
[6920.36s -> 6921.24s]  You're looking for a prayer?
[6921.24s -> 6923.32s]  You're looking for me to supply wood?
[6923.32s -> 6924.52s]  How dare they leave?
[6924.52s -> 6926.92s]  After all we've done for them
[6926.92s -> 6929.24s]  What have we done for them exactly?
[6929.24s -> 6931.08s]  Perhaps we should help them out.
[6931.08s -> 6932.12s]  It might be nice.
[6933.80s -> 6936.28s]  How much wood do they need?
[6937.16s -> 6940.14s]  What does it say?
[6941.30s -> 6941.86s]  The ark.
[6942.58s -> 6945.62s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[6945.62s -> 6946.34s]  I don't want to do this again.
[6946.34s -> 6949.30s]  This notion that we quite like to sail the ocean
[6949.30s -> 6949.38s]  So we're building a big boat to leave here for good
[6949.38s -> 6950.10s]  I can't skip it again.
[6950.10s -> 6951.06s]  So we're building a big boat to leave here for good
[6951.06s -> 6951.86s]  I can't skip it again.
[6951.86s -> 6954.58s]  So we're building a big boat to leave here for good
[6954.58s -> 6956.42s]  We're not keen on sinking
[6956.42s -> 6958.74s]  So we're all sitting here and thinking
[6958.74s -> 6960.90s]  Cause we built it too big
[6960.90s -> 6963.38s]  And we've run out of wood
[6964.18s -> 6966.18s]  I leave
[6966.18s -> 6968.18s]  I leave
[6968.18s -> 6972.42s]  We simply can't leave till we get some more wood
[6973.54s -> 6976.18s]  Not keen on sinking
[6976.18s -> 6978.50s]  So that's why we're sitting thinking
[6978.50s -> 6981.86s]  Cause we simply can't leave till we get some more wood
[6982.90s -> 6986.74s]  Oh, you're not gonna leave me hanging
[6986.74s -> 6987.54s]  We're gonna do another verse
[6988.26s -> 6999.88s]  We need wood
[6999.88s -> 7000.92s]  How much wood?
[7000.92s -> 7003.51s]  I wish it would tell me
[7004.15s -> 7005.14s]  Let's go get some
[7005.14s -> 7005.94s]  Let's do it
[7005.94s -> 7006.66s]  I'll do it
[7006.66s -> 7008.02s]  I could smash up this thing right now
[7008.02s -> 7009.46s]  But I know you're looking at me
[7009.46s -> 7010.34s]  I know
[7010.34s -> 7011.22s]  I'm just gonna take wood
[7011.78s -> 7012.18s]  Let's go
[7012.82s -> 7014.66s]  How much wood do I have over here?
[7014.66s -> 7015.62s]  An absolute shitload
[7015.62s -> 7016.18s]  Like too much
[7019.29s -> 7020.25s]  Let's get like 5,000
[7020.97s -> 7030.18s]  What are they doing over here?
[7030.18s -> 7032.22s]  Are they praying?
[7033.02s -> 7034.30s]  What the fuck was that?
[7034.30s -> 7034.80s]  Hey!
[7035.76s -> 7045.10s]  What?
[7045.95s -> 7047.95s]  Did he kick that from all the way?
[7048.91s -> 7049.71s]  What did you do?
[7050.75s -> 7054.57s]  Why is the leash not working?
[7054.57s -> 7056.57s]  Hey, you're supposed to be stuck in there
[7060.59s -> 7062.51s]  Why is the leash not working?
[7062.51s -> 7063.39s]  What is going on?
[7069.24s -> 7070.44s]  Get over here
[7070.44s -> 7071.32s]  Wait a minute
[7071.32s -> 7072.92s]  What the fuck is going on here?
[7075.15s -> 7075.87s]  Get over here
[7075.87s -> 7076.75s]  You're in big trouble
[7078.96s -> 7080.48s]  You are actually in big trouble
[7080.48s -> 7081.04s]  Get over here
[7085.71s -> 7086.27s]  He did it
[7086.99s -> 7092.17s]  I'm gonna make a FIFA reference here
[7094.22s -> 7096.38s]  Because that's the only way I can make this reference
[7097.18s -> 7100.41s]  He just grabbed the ball as the goalie
[7101.13s -> 7103.77s]  And did a full power kick across the whole game
[7104.41s -> 7106.89s]  And for some reason you fucked up as the other goalie
[7106.89s -> 7108.01s]  Like you are on the other team
[7108.01s -> 7110.25s]  And they scored from the other side
[7111.13s -> 7112.01s]  That was ridiculous
[7112.89s -> 7120.83s]  Get over here
[7120.83s -> 7121.95s]  I need to be like putting
[7121.95s -> 7123.23s]  You want a boulder or something?
[7126.73s -> 7127.77s]  You can't kick that out, right?
[7132.46s -> 7135.34s]  I played like FIFA maybe once
[7135.34s -> 7136.54s]  But that's what it reminded me of
[7137.66s -> 7143.52s]  Punish him
[7145.71s -> 7146.75s]  It's been too long
[7146.75s -> 7147.47s]  I can't punish him
[7147.47s -> 7148.67s]  It's been too long
[7148.67s -> 7148.91s]  All right
[7148.91s -> 7149.55s]  I'm just gonna like
[7149.55s -> 7150.35s]  I'm gonna like just
[7153.40s -> 7154.04s]  Don't do that
[7155.16s -> 7163.63s]  Yeah, he can't get out
[7164.83s -> 7167.98s]  He just fucking like threw
[7167.98s -> 7169.18s]  Imagine if that was a rock
[7169.82s -> 7171.74s]  Imagine if he had access to a rock
[7172.94s -> 7174.46s]  That would have been catastrophic
[7175.10s -> 7178.84s]  Where's this stupid boat?
[7178.84s -> 7184.01s]  Look what I got
[7184.81s -> 7185.13s]  Wood
[7185.77s -> 7189.56s]  Look at that
[7190.84s -> 7191.48s]  Thank you for
[7192.28s -> 7199.53s]  Three guys, huh?
[7200.17s -> 7209.13s]  Now destroy the ship?
[7209.69s -> 7210.09s]  No
[7241.21s -> 7244.89s]  I couldn't read that
[7256.25s -> 7264.40s]  I'm not doing that again, by the way
[7264.40s -> 7266.16s]  I refused to sing another one of those
[7266.16s -> 7269.60s]  Like lazy singing is what I was doing
[7271.32s -> 7272.12s]  That kind of worked too
[7272.12s -> 7272.36s]  All right
[7272.36s -> 7273.48s]  Let's grain fine
[7273.48s -> 7273.72s]  Go
[7289.16s -> 7290.12s]  He's pissed
[7298.01s -> 7298.73s]  Well, don't just
[7299.93s -> 7302.65s]  Soccer kick balls into people that are praying
[7304.44s -> 7306.60s]  That's incredibly mean
[7312.48s -> 7312.96s]  Here
[7312.96s -> 7313.84s]  I'm putting this back
[7314.48s -> 7321.69s]  Oh, that's right
[7321.69s -> 7322.17s]  Ball
[7322.17s -> 7322.73s]  Yes, it is
[7324.06s -> 7324.94s]  Don't do that again
[7325.66s -> 7331.63s]  Dude, I'm not even certain
[7331.63s -> 7333.39s]  The leash does a fucking goddamn thing
[7333.39s -> 7334.03s]  Like how can he
[7334.03s -> 7335.31s]  Well, why can he do this?
[7336.35s -> 7345.45s]  He's not gonna do it again
[7351.10s -> 7364.32s]  This leash doesn't do anything
[7370.88s -> 7372.40s]  How do I make the leash work?
[7373.28s -> 7377.07s]  You're gonna lose it
[7378.20s -> 7379.24s]  You're gonna lose it in the water
[7382.60s -> 7383.72s]  Lock it with mouse, too
[7384.44s -> 7384.84s]  I mean
[7385.64s -> 7386.60s]  Isn't it locked?
[7386.60s -> 7387.48s]  It's locked to a tree
[7387.48s -> 7389.24s]  Like a hundred fucking miles behind him
[7390.36s -> 7392.12s]  Fish farms can provide food for your village
[7392.12s -> 7393.80s]  A fisherman will deliver his catch to the village
[7393.80s -> 7394.28s]  Oh, that's cool
[7395.93s -> 7396.89s]  Shorten the length of the
[7397.69s -> 7398.73s]  How do I shorten the length?
[7400.09s -> 7400.33s]  All right
[7400.97s -> 7401.29s]  Stop
[7402.17s -> 7406.60s]  Get up there
[7407.40s -> 7414.41s]  Just let him do what he wants
[7414.41s -> 7415.53s]  No, it's a problem
[7416.49s -> 7416.89s]  All right
[7416.89s -> 7418.17s]  So if I attach it to here
[7419.05s -> 7421.93s]  And then how do I shorten the leash?
[7430.09s -> 7431.05s]  I have the leash here
[7431.69s -> 7433.37s]  So how do I shorten it now?
[7433.37s -> 7441.55s]  Okay
[7444.35s -> 7447.10s]  Restrict the area in which a creature can move when he's on a leash
[7447.10s -> 7448.70s]  First, attach the leash to an object
[7448.70s -> 7451.50s]  Then click the action button anywhere on the leash to pick it up
[7452.14s -> 7455.18s]  Pull to stretch the leash to the length you want it to be
[7455.18s -> 7457.18s]  Then click the action button on the ground
[7457.90s -> 7458.78s]  To set its length
[7459.66s -> 7476.17s]  Is that going to work?
[7476.97s -> 7480.40s]  No, it's not working
[7481.76s -> 7485.34s]  I never understood this mechanic either
[7486.22s -> 7491.31s]  I mean, I should be able just to stick it, right?
[7491.31s -> 7491.79s]  Like that?
[7492.35s -> 7493.95s]  Because look, I'm just giving him slack
[7496.22s -> 7496.46s]  Pull
[7497.52s -> 7497.76s]  Pull
[7500.59s -> 7502.04s]  It's probably bugged
[7503.21s -> 7508.78s]  Well, pull it back into the building
[7509.34s -> 7518.08s]  I don't know if that's doing anything
[7518.64s -> 7519.60s]  Is it the scroll wheel?
[7519.60s -> 7520.40s]  I don't think so
[7520.40s -> 7520.96s]  Wait, hold on
[7520.96s -> 7521.44s]  Did that work?
[7522.96s -> 7527.64s]  Maybe that did work
[7533.69s -> 7535.64s]  Maybe
[7535.64s -> 7536.60s]  I'll check back later
[7536.60s -> 7537.16s]  I think it worked
[7538.83s -> 7540.43s]  You have to like pull it into the
[7541.15s -> 7541.87s]  I think that worked
[7542.59s -> 7543.85s]  Is he bigger?
[7543.85s -> 7544.97s]  Maybe a little
[7544.97s -> 7545.29s]  All right
[7545.29s -> 7546.57s]  I need to do a brain
[7547.45s -> 7559.39s]  Go get his ball
[7560.11s -> 7561.92s]  It didn't
[7561.92s -> 7562.56s]  No, it didn't work
[7568.41s -> 7570.17s]  Why can he just do this forever?
[7577.07s -> 7578.27s]  He wants the ball
[7578.27s -> 7579.23s]  All right, whatever
[7579.95s -> 7584.19s]  I gotta put this wood back
[7591.36s -> 7592.00s]  He's hungry
[7592.96s -> 7594.32s]  Stop kicking this shit
[7598.03s -> 7598.35s]  Stop
[7599.15s -> 7603.88s]  Go back up here
[7604.52s -> 7611.28s]  Dude, your leash is too long
[7612.08s -> 7615.16s]  Fix the screen?
[7615.16s -> 7616.36s]  What are you talking about?
[7616.36s -> 7623.88s]  Just reapply the leash
[7624.60s -> 7624.84s]  Here
[7626.28s -> 7631.92s]  Leash is on
[7635.12s -> 7635.76s]  Leash is on
[7636.56s -> 7639.48s]  Maybe choose a tree
[7640.20s -> 7641.64s]  No, he ran all the way over
[7641.64s -> 7642.60s]  Whatever, he'll be fine
[7642.60s -> 7643.48s]  Use a regular leash
[7643.48s -> 7643.88s]  Isn't this a
[7644.60s -> 7645.56s]  This is a regular leash
[7646.12s -> 7646.84s]  This is like the
[7647.64s -> 7647.96s]  Your
[7648.84s -> 7650.20s]  This is the neutral one, right?
[7651.16s -> 7652.09s]  All right
[7652.09s -> 7652.49s]  Let me keep
[7652.49s -> 7653.93s]  Let me go do the grains thing
[7654.81s -> 7656.67s]  How much do they need?
[7657.47s -> 7657.79s]  I don't know
[7662.52s -> 7663.08s]  2,000?
[7663.80s -> 7665.58s]  4,000?
[7665.58s -> 7665.90s]  Let's do
[7665.90s -> 7667.02s]  We'll just do like 4,000
[7669.26s -> 7670.30s]  A million grain
[7670.30s -> 7671.34s]  Well, that would be ridiculous
[7671.98s -> 7673.95s]  All right
[7673.95s -> 7674.83s]  Where the hell is it though?
[7675.39s -> 7678.12s]  I keep losing shit
[7690.17s -> 7691.52s]  All right
[7691.52s -> 7691.84s]  Here
[7694.16s -> 7696.40s]  We're grateful for the grain, holy one
[7701.85s -> 7702.91s]  Another thing
[7703.71s -> 7707.39s]  It's quite boring if that's all you eat
[7707.39s -> 7709.45s]  Need some flavor
[7709.45s -> 7711.85s]  So do us all a little favor
[7711.85s -> 7714.17s]  Because we ain't going nowhere
[7714.17s -> 7716.33s]  Till we get some meat
[7716.33s -> 7718.09s]  Why don't you eat Bob over there?
[7721.20s -> 7721.92s]  Draw straws
[7721.92s -> 7726.16s]  We can't leave until we got some meat
[7726.16s -> 7729.20s]  So do us a favor
[7729.20s -> 7731.68s]  Find something with a little flavor
[7731.68s -> 7733.92s]  Because we ain't going nowhere
[7733.92s -> 7735.84s]  Till we got some meat
[7735.84s -> 7736.56s]  Okay, found one
[7743.68s -> 7744.96s]  Thanks for all this meat
[7745.52s -> 7746.96s]  We need more meat though
[7758.24s -> 7759.52s]  Thanks for all this meat
[7765.12s -> 7767.56s]  Wait, how many people are gonna leave?
[7768.60s -> 7772.24s]  Forget you, you know
[7773.20s -> 7774.40s]  See, what they don't know
[7775.04s -> 7778.32s]  Is I'm doing that thing where I grab an arrow
[7778.32s -> 7779.92s]  And try to burn it down
[7779.92s -> 7781.20s]  It's like sending out a funeral
[7797.34s -> 7798.94s]  I just hate goodbyes
[7799.74s -> 7801.58s]  I just hate good
[7801.58s -> 7803.79s]  I got something
[7803.79s -> 7804.19s]  What is it?
[7804.75s -> 7808.84s]  This pedestal is a miracle dispenser
[7808.84s -> 7813.00s]  It charges up and generates one-shot miracles
[7813.00s -> 7815.32s]  Click on the signpost for more info
[7815.32s -> 7816.20s]  Is it rain?
[7816.20s -> 7816.60s]  Clouds?
[7816.60s -> 7817.00s]  What is it?
[7818.36s -> 7820.57s]  A handful of water
[7821.61s -> 7823.93s]  There are miracles hidden all over Eden
[7823.93s -> 7824.89s]  Keep your eyes peeled
[7825.69s -> 7827.77s]  A miracle dispenser gives a one-shot miracle
[7827.77s -> 7829.45s]  Wonders when it's fully charged
[7829.45s -> 7830.25s]  This is water
[7838.36s -> 7850.27s]  Okay, what's water?
[7853.18s -> 7854.30s]  Is this my village?
[7854.30s -> 7855.50s]  No, not yet
[7856.22s -> 7857.69s]  Oh, they have a stone over there
[7857.69s -> 7858.25s]  What's that thing?
[7858.25s -> 7859.77s]  All right, how about right over here?
[7859.77s -> 7865.31s]  Let's water the trees
[7866.27s -> 7866.83s]  Like over here
[7878.78s -> 7879.98s]  All right, nice
[7882.46s -> 7883.50s]  What do you mean the cow?
[7883.50s -> 7884.00s]  What?
[7899.34s -> 7901.10s]  There's no point of you even having this leash on
[7901.82s -> 7908.17s]  There's just no point
[7908.89s -> 7910.81s]  Here, just you go do you
[7911.77s -> 7916.75s]  Has he eaten anything without you looking?
[7917.39s -> 7917.79s]  I don't know
[7918.59s -> 7925.29s]  You have to restrict the length of the leash
[7925.29s -> 7926.81s]  Yeah, I tried to do that like five times
[7928.19s -> 7930.03s]  Just pull it and click the action
[7930.03s -> 7932.35s]  But it does it just I can't get it to do anything
[7937.74s -> 7939.58s]  Yeah, it legit just didn't work
[7939.58s -> 7940.46s]  It really didn't
[7940.46s -> 7941.50s]  I kept undoing it
[7942.94s -> 7945.84s]  All right, I'm gonna do this one more time
[7946.72s -> 7947.92s]  So we can be clear
[7954.67s -> 7956.27s]  Oh my god, that's a lot
[7956.27s -> 7957.55s]  What did you that's a lot of
[7958.43s -> 7962.12s]  All right, leash is on tree, right?
[7962.12s -> 7963.16s]  Okay, leash on tree
[7970.12s -> 7971.32s]  You hate this person
[7972.04s -> 7973.80s]  He comes up from points every time
[7974.97s -> 7976.17s]  All right, so no wrong
[7977.05s -> 7979.26s]  All right, so look
[7980.65s -> 7981.77s]  So grab the leash
[7982.49s -> 7984.73s]  I have the leash in my hand right now
[7989.52s -> 7990.24s]  I can't do anything
[7995.23s -> 7999.12s]  I mean, you've moved it
[8000.16s -> 8000.88s]  Don't do that
[8007.10s -> 8007.82s]  Don't don't click
[8007.82s -> 8008.70s]  Well, I have to okay
[8008.70s -> 8010.94s]  I have to hold right click to hold this
[8018.81s -> 8021.21s]  Right click I have to hold right click, right?
[8022.19s -> 8023.71s]  If I let go of right click
[8024.67s -> 8025.79s]  He just let you let it go
[8026.43s -> 8028.76s]  Like I can pull it
[8028.76s -> 8029.80s]  But it doesn't seem to do anything
[8030.44s -> 8034.78s]  I mean scrolling just moves in and out
[8037.00s -> 8038.52s]  And if I click you just let it go
[8043.64s -> 8046.97s]  He's just gonna roam around or whatever
[8050.24s -> 8051.36s]  Or he can just do that
[8051.92s -> 8053.76s]  And it doesn't even matter where the leash is
[8061.88s -> 8062.52s]  He's pissed
[8063.16s -> 8064.44s]  This is what
[8065.08s -> 8065.40s]  Hold on
[8065.40s -> 8067.16s]  Did he just do like the fuck you?
[8077.63s -> 8078.99s]  Why do you hate this person?
[8079.55s -> 8081.79s]  I don't understand what his problem is
[8084.35s -> 8085.63s]  Just go relax
[8085.63s -> 8086.59s]  Go sleep somewhere
[8088.09s -> 8088.89s]  I've got stuff to do
[8093.37s -> 8094.17s]  You are he's coming
[8094.17s -> 8094.65s]  He's coming back
[8094.65s -> 8095.77s]  All right, all right, right, right, right
[8097.72s -> 8100.51s]  The temple is like clicking right now
[8104.72s -> 8105.76s]  Why is the temple doing this?
[8107.39s -> 8108.75s]  Oh creature creature room
[8112.32s -> 8113.52s]  The creature cave
[8114.97s -> 8118.41s]  The screws display different attributes about your creature

[8161.18s -> 8161.98s]  Creature mind
[8161.98s -> 8164.62s]  This girl shows our creature's state of mind
[8165.98s -> 8167.82s]  His likes and dislikes
[8169.90s -> 8171.42s]  I am slightly greedy
[8171.42s -> 8173.10s]  I'm extremely tired
[8173.10s -> 8174.78s]  I'm very compassionate
[8174.78s -> 8176.38s]  I'm extremely frightened
[8176.38s -> 8177.42s]  I'm rather playful
[8178.38s -> 8180.06s]  I think my god is on the side of good
[8180.70s -> 8182.70s]  My deity has paid me quite a lot of attention
[8183.74s -> 8184.94s]  What do I think about the creature guy?
[8184.94s -> 8186.06s]  He's on the side of good
[8187.02s -> 8189.20s]  What do I think about creature slag?
[8189.20s -> 8190.32s]  He is black hearted
[8193.80s -> 8197.48s]  The creature god is the is the person that he ate by the way
[8197.48s -> 8201.71s]  I know about one temple
[8201.71s -> 8204.27s]  I know about two creatures who oh slag
[8204.27s -> 8205.63s]  Okay, we have to kick slags ass
[8207.93s -> 8211.29s]  More general information such as his age and height
[8211.29s -> 8212.17s]  This him
[8212.17s -> 8213.29s]  Wait, his name is god
[8213.29s -> 8214.01s]  Hey boss
[8214.01s -> 8218.01s]  You can change or add tattoos to the creature by clicking on him
[8220.67s -> 8221.31s]  On the side
[8221.31s -> 8223.31s]  All right, wait, how do I rename the character?
[8226.19s -> 8227.63s]  Amount of poop zero
[8227.63s -> 8228.99s]  People killed one
[8230.03s -> 8231.07s]  Animals killed eight
[8233.10s -> 8234.06s]  Twelve poops
[8234.06s -> 8237.26s]  So he's only killed one person and it was the creature trainer
[8241.08s -> 8241.80s]  How do I rename?
[8245.53s -> 8247.77s]  This squirrel shows what he's learned to do
[8249.24s -> 8250.84s]  Phil is praying with evil
[8253.85s -> 8257.13s]  Your creature has learned that he can take food from the field
[8257.13s -> 8257.63s]  Okay
[8258.49s -> 8261.21s]  Your creature doesn't know how to use the totem
[8261.21s -> 8262.41s]  Get him and watch you moving it
[8262.41s -> 8262.91s]  All right
[8263.61s -> 8265.37s]  Doesn't know how to use the village store
[8265.37s -> 8267.05s]  Get him to watch the villagers you
[8267.05s -> 8267.55s]  Okay
[8267.77s -> 8268.41s]  It's on the list
[8269.21s -> 8270.49s]  Your creature has learned how to fish
[8270.49s -> 8272.09s]  Your creature has learned how to dance
[8273.21s -> 8274.97s]  I haven't seen that
[8276.17s -> 8281.76s]  This creature is dumb
[8281.76s -> 8282.48s]  Yeah, pretty dumb
[8283.76s -> 8284.26s]  Pretty dumb
[8284.80s -> 8285.92s]  Let's check this
[8285.92s -> 8287.04s]  132 people living
[8287.68s -> 8288.96s]  96% believe
[8290.57s -> 8291.53s]  10 deaths
[8291.53s -> 8292.57s]  67 births
[8293.21s -> 8295.63s]  Okay
[8295.63s -> 8296.43s]  We need some more
[8296.43s -> 8297.87s]  All right, I gotta make some more people
[8298.67s -> 8303.52s]  All right, let's head out of here
[8308.24s -> 8308.74s]  There he is
[8310.48s -> 8311.44s]  What's with the heartbeat?
[8311.44s -> 8313.36s]  The do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
[8314.41s -> 8315.69s]  Why what's why is it happening?
[8316.33s -> 8328.00s]  Didn't it say I can like do something to him?
[8328.00s -> 8329.52s]  I can give him like tattoos
[8337.85s -> 8338.73s]  Give him some tattoos
[8338.73s -> 8338.97s]  I don't know
[8338.97s -> 8340.17s]  How do I do that?
[8340.17s -> 8340.73s]  All right
[8340.73s -> 8341.23s]  Hold on
[8342.62s -> 8344.62s]  I got other tasks that I have to complete
[8344.62s -> 8346.14s]  So I can get some more miracles and shit
[8346.14s -> 8347.58s]  Because yeah like we got to
[8348.38s -> 8351.15s]  There are still sheep missing
[8351.15s -> 8357.90s]  What is this one?
[8357.90s -> 8358.78s]  Oh no
[8358.78s -> 8360.78s]  Some of my poor children are lost
[8360.78s -> 8361.82s]  They'll need rescuing
[8363.26s -> 8366.46s]  A stranger has been seen putting the children into trances
[8366.46s -> 8367.58s]  Who the fuck is this guy?
[8368.46s -> 8370.94s]  He has them imprisoned in a secret place
[8370.94s -> 8371.44s]  What?
[8373.29s -> 8374.89s]  This stranger is to blame
[8374.89s -> 8376.01s]  It's got to be him
[8376.57s -> 8378.89s]  But if he should die before we find the children
[8378.89s -> 8380.49s]  They could be lost forever
[8380.49s -> 8381.77s]  Oh my babies
[8384.73s -> 8385.23s]  Let's go
[8385.93s -> 8386.73s]  We must act
[8387.29s -> 8388.73s]  Tiny lives are at stake
[8389.61s -> 8390.89s]  Tiny lives?
[8390.89s -> 8392.81s]  Come on who cares?
[8393.21s -> 8395.77s]  I gotta get this heartbeat to turn off before I lose my mind
[8398.09s -> 8402.73s]  How do I shut this off?
[8419.68s -> 8421.20s]  Is this something that it wants me to do in here?
[8421.20s -> 8422.32s]  That I just to make it like a

[8440.57s -> 8442.09s]  Uh this doesn't look right at all
[8442.09s -> 8450.01s]  The Pied Piper
[8450.01s -> 8450.89s]  All right well at least I

[8464.44s -> 8467.53s]  We have to find the person that's stealing the children
[8472.44s -> 8473.56s]  Where the hell is that?
[8475.76s -> 8476.88s]  No the heartbeat's back
[8477.68s -> 8496.83s]  I can hear it everywhere
[8497.63s -> 8500.30s]  Go save the kids

[8528.94s -> 8530.06s]  It was pretty good
[8530.06s -> 8530.78s]  It was all right

[8557.47s -> 8559.07s]  All right you go take a look over here
[8559.07s -> 8560.19s]  I gotta return this sheep
[8561.07s -> 8564.00s]  For the love of god
[8564.00s -> 8565.04s]  That fucking heartbeat
[8565.76s -> 8567.12s]  How do I get it to stop?
[8568.62s -> 8569.66s]  It won't stop
[8570.30s -> 8576.62s]  Where's the sheep guy?
[8586.11s -> 8587.71s]  Many thanks higher power
[8587.71s -> 8588.75s]  Keep them coming please
[8589.63s -> 8592.22s]  It's under the floor

[8616.54s -> 8617.18s]  Is this too
[8617.18s -> 8617.68s]  What is this?
[8623.96s -> 8625.88s]  As I see it there ain't no need
[8625.88s -> 8627.80s]  For me to bow before you son
[8627.80s -> 8628.52s]  Going right through the water
[8628.52s -> 8630.20s]  I ain't seen deadly from you
[8630.20s -> 8632.28s]  Which infesses me what it a bit
[8632.92s -> 8635.08s]  Gods have huge creatures
[8635.08s -> 8636.92s]  And that's what my mama always told me
[8637.48s -> 8640.04s]  And until I see a big enough one
[8640.04s -> 8641.88s]  You don't mean nothing to me
[8644.12s -> 8644.62s]  Okay
[8645.18s -> 8646.46s]  I need to have a big creature
[8646.46s -> 8648.78s]  Oh don't leave him as a lost soul
[8648.78s -> 8650.38s]  Show him your creature
[8650.38s -> 8652.70s]  Oh let him die alone
[8652.70s -> 8653.90s]  It's what he wants
[8653.90s -> 8654.86s]  The hick
[8654.86s -> 8658.14s]  You don't have to justify yourself to him
[8658.14s -> 8659.02s]  Oh come on
[8659.02s -> 8660.78s]  You've got better things to destroy
[8662.14s -> 8695.47s]  Believe me now?
[8701.97s -> 8705.66s]  Okay fine
[8720.86s -> 8724.62s]  You killed him you uncaring horrid mean god
[8737.47s -> 8743.20s]  Wait wait what?
[8744.00s -> 8744.88s]  Is he dead?
[8745.76s -> 8759.06s]  But why can I touch it?
[8759.06s -> 8759.86s]  Why can I pick him up?
[8766.59s -> 8768.03s]  Where was that?
[8768.03s -> 8768.83s]  Where was that?
[8768.83s -> 8770.19s]  Oh I got so turned around
[8770.19s -> 8771.15s]  Fuck where was that?
[8771.95s -> 8776.27s]  Where was that?
[8776.27s -> 8776.77s]  Right here
[8809.41s -> 8811.49s]  I'm gonna take myself completely out of the picture
[8811.49s -> 8812.13s]  I want to see
[8812.13s -> 8812.85s]  I want him to learn
[8812.85s -> 8813.73s]  I want him to see things
[8813.73s -> 8814.45s]  I don't be like what?
[8815.33s -> 8816.21s]  Dead you know what I mean?
[8816.21s -> 8816.71s]  Person
[8817.33s -> 8818.85s]  I'm taking myself completely out of this one
[8821.14s -> 8822.74s]  House you know what else is over here
[8823.30s -> 8824.26s]  He needs to see things
[8835.23s -> 8835.79s]  He notices
[8836.35s -> 8837.42s]  He's like where's dad?
[8838.06s -> 8840.19s]  Where's dad?
[8841.15s -> 8842.27s]  He's just looking at him
[8848.80s -> 8849.92s]  No no no
[8849.92s -> 8850.96s]  You didn't learn anything

[12714.68s -> 12719.40s]  Your worship site is built now. Let me teach you how to create miracles
[12720.12s -> 12726.44s]  Your people will worship you at the temple to send them there. You must raise the totem at the village center
[12727.08s -> 12729.48s]  You move the hand over the totem
[12731.32s -> 12735.32s]  Then you hold down the action button to grab the totem
[12736.04s -> 12740.60s]  You move the hand up and down to raise and lower the totem
[12741.56s -> 12746.28s]  I've raised the totem. So your this is come worshiping to the worship site
[12747.85s -> 12754.65s]  The higher you raise the totem the more people from your village will go to worship you this is emergency prayer

[12765.34s -> 12769.66s]  Okay, they are dancing worshiping you this gives you power
[12771.42s -> 12772.46s]  All right

[12794.35s -> 12799.87s]  To activate one grab the miracle with the action button and it will be charged by your worship it
[12800.51s -> 12803.79s]  You'll see the energy rings flowing into your hand
[12805.85s -> 12810.81s]  When the miracle is charged it appears in your hand and you are ready to cast the miracle
[12811.77s -> 12818.41s]  Remember worshiping comes at a cost the needs of your worshipers can be seen on these flags
[12819.05s -> 12824.25s]  So it's good to satisfy these needs and keep your villagers in good health
[12829.64s -> 12835.80s]  I'll leave you now to experiment with miracles and expand your influence by growing your village
[12836.04s -> 12838.20s]  So you just have to have grain to stick it outside here

[12858.14s -> 12861.34s]  Miracles at its village center, which also can be its worship site
[12861.90s -> 12865.50s]  Worshippers need food and rest which can be seen on the needs flag
[12866.38s -> 12870.46s]  Worshippers will swap with less tired worshipers from the village if they're available
[12871.66s -> 12874.62s]  You must use the action button to activate a miracle for charging
[12876.16s -> 12877.92s]  Yeah, okay
[12879.32s -> 12886.60s]  Did he just shrink he just shrunk uh worshipers can die chanting
[12888.60s -> 12895.24s]  In the middle of worship site is a chant store if no miracles are charging the worshipers will chant into the chant store for later use
[12896.65s -> 12901.77s]  One-shot miracles may be added to the chant store. You can also give your charged miracle energy to other gods
[12905.13s -> 12907.69s]  All right. Well, I don't want them to to dance to death

[13076.83s -> 13078.91s]  You hold the action button down
[13079.55s -> 13080.99s]  Like this
[13080.99s -> 13084.67s]  You then move the hand to put momentum on the fireball
[13085.71s -> 13088.83s]  You release the action to cast the fireball
[13089.87s -> 13094.03s]  Devastating you missed fire spreads and causes serious

[13231.68s -> 13234.48s]  Right. Well, come here. Let's try that. There's more stuff to do over here
[13236.97s -> 13239.23s]  By combining up to seven scaffolds
[13240.78s -> 13243.98s]  You can create the following structures. One is a small house
[13244.94s -> 13247.26s]  Two is a big house. Three is a civic building
[13248.35s -> 13250.59s]  Four is field five is a village center

[13290.44s -> 13294.24s]  Here's the food miracle
[13294.24s -> 13296.80s]  Look watch what I can do

[13311.02s -> 13315.82s]  Okay, let's uh, let's figure this out
[13320.20s -> 13323.24s]  Kazaa sent me I can help you build your settlement up
[13328.48s -> 13329.44s]  right
[13329.44s -> 13332.72s]  People are sleeping outdoors as they don't have enough buildings to live in
[13336.84s -> 13339.16s]  This is the workshop. I make scaffolding here
[13339.56s -> 13344.92s]  It allows you to decide where new buildings should be constructed. All right, let's go you can supply me with enough wood
[13345.24s -> 13347.24s]  I can build a scaffold
[13347.48s -> 13349.45s]  more houses
[13349.45s -> 13351.45s]  Feed he's not no, I need this person
[13353.68s -> 13355.68s]  So you get scaffolds you can do I get it
[13356.40s -> 13360.24s]  How much wood do you need?
[13360.24s -> 13362.96s]  Oh man in the workshop wants some wood
[13363.92s -> 13365.45s]  Okay
[13365.45s -> 13367.45s]  I can do that
[13367.45s -> 13369.45s]  How much like five grand ten grand
[13371.04s -> 13372.80s]  Well, i'll give you ten thousand
[13372.80s -> 13374.80s]  No, let's do five dollars
[13376.27s -> 13378.27s]  Don't make the soccer field it's bugged
[13378.67s -> 13381.23s]  I think there's an actual patch to do that right here
[13382.19s -> 13384.19s]  Look, there's a lot of
[13385.55s -> 13389.56s]  All right
[13389.56s -> 13391.56s]  How did I get this game?
[13392.20s -> 13393.80s]  I bought it
[13393.80s -> 13395.53s]  and then
[13395.53s -> 13397.29s]  I installed it
[13397.29s -> 13400.65s]  And then I had to do a bunch of tweaks to get it to work on windows 10
[13401.13s -> 13405.21s]  Because if you don't know this game had some of the shittiest drm ever made
[13405.93s -> 13409.23s]  Give me a little point where turn the wood into scaffolds
[13409.45s -> 13413.77s]  Uh went like windows actually removed the ability to use the drm
[13414.41s -> 13416.41s]  Because it's such a vulnerable piece of shit
[13417.05s -> 13419.39s]  so
[13419.39s -> 13421.63s]  You have to like essentially
[13422.27s -> 13424.27s]  You have to either disable
[13424.67s -> 13428.19s]  a feature in windows and put your computer at risk
[13428.67s -> 13432.19s]  Or you have to go around the drm is the only possible way you can play
[13434.19s -> 13440.27s]  It looks like your scaffolding is ready. We just need to move it to an area where we want it built
[13440.35s -> 13444.72s]  That's a lot of wood to place a scaffold down on the ground. All right, let's get it
[13445.60s -> 13447.60s]  Scaffold value one
[13448.16s -> 13454.08s]  When you're happy with its location and angle click the action button. All right, let's make like let's let's not be stupid about this
[13454.40s -> 13457.40s]  How about um
[13457.40s -> 13459.40s]  Down here. Yeah, this looks all right
[13460.33s -> 13461.77s]  right here
[13461.77s -> 13466.41s]  Oh, this is such a worthwhile cause planning homes to be built for the homeless
[13466.65s -> 13471.29s]  There is another way to solve this homeless problem. Oh, yes. Yeah
[13471.85s -> 13473.05s]  Kill him
[13473.05s -> 13476.76s]  These two guys are fucking wild

[13480.76s -> 13483.05s]  Practice your water
[13483.05s -> 13488.99s]  I know you can do it. You need more buildings. You just scared him. Thanks a lot dickhead

[15003.28s -> 15008.00s]  The stones hold the spirits of the ancients each has its own voice
[15010.68s -> 15015.40s]  It is said that when a correct tune is played special powers are unleashed
[15015.88s -> 15019.32s]  When the stones are tapped the spirit sings
[15020.12s -> 15025.96s]  Few people know the melodies you may meet them or discover the melodies for yourself
[15027.64s -> 15033.07s]  Okay lightning
[15036.25s -> 15038.25s]  I just fucking learned a melody god damn it

[15115.74s -> 15121.82s]  The bottom is cut off because it's 1080p. This game was never designed to be 1080p in hd
[15122.70s -> 15126.54s]  So and you lose like a tiny amount of the bottom of the screen
[15127.26s -> 15134.17s]  Sorry about that
[15134.17s -> 15138.49s]  Uh, let's get some forest

[15326.16s -> 15328.01s]  This is crave
[15328.01s -> 15331.15s]  Jerky, it's the best jerky you can buy

[15403.60s -> 15409.50s]  Can I pull this down?
[15409.50s -> 15426.56s]  All right. Come on
[15426.56s -> 15431.68s]  Imagine seeing that the gods like oh here comes. Oh, that's how you want to play, huh?
[15432.81s -> 15434.81s]  Oh, that was pathetic
[15436.59s -> 15438.27s]  You missed
[15438.27s -> 15443.04s]  All right, everybody go this he's chasing birds. All right, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop
[15445.44s -> 15457.60s]  People will die if I do this shit still I've got more forest. This is why they don't fire. Are they burning?
[15459.71s -> 15464.38s]  No, they aren't right
[15465.42s -> 15467.72s]  There's another thing to do over here
[15470.00s -> 15473.68s]  Soon you will need to protect your villages and their buildings
[15474.40s -> 15479.68s]  The physical shield protects against objects which are not of a spiritual nature
[15480.32s -> 15484.08s]  When you have the miracle, this is how you cast a shield
[15484.32s -> 15486.84s]  The shield
[15486.84s -> 15490.68s]  You move the hand to where you wish to start the shield
[15491.32s -> 15496.12s]  Why then you hold down the action button and trace the perimeter of the shield?
[15496.84s -> 15498.36s]  like this
[15498.36s -> 15500.36s]  and the shield
[15500.52s -> 15504.36s]  I'll throw these rocks at the hut and watch the shield
[15514.67s -> 15527.63s]  All right, it's protected the shield deflects the rocks
[15528.43s -> 15530.43s]  Now you can try
[15530.43s -> 15532.83s]  Shield the hut and I will attack it
[15533.55s -> 15537.71s]  Tap the shield medical and wait hold the action button
[15541.55s -> 15543.85s]  This is black and white
[15551.12s -> 15553.12s]  The shield is ready
[15559.40s -> 15561.80s]  Is there a throw rock spell or something that i'm missing
[15562.60s -> 15565.64s]  The hut survived my onslaught. Well done
[15566.36s -> 15570.52s]  Different sized objects to different levels of damage to a shield
[15571.16s -> 15578.76s]  It will disappear after taking excessive damages. I have given the knowledge of the from now on your people can worship
[15579.40s -> 15583.02s]  Thank you
[15583.02s -> 15585.02s]  It's really hard to obtain and to install
[15585.26s -> 15587.26s]  Yeah, it's a pain in the ass
[15587.42s -> 15589.42s]  But I got it running
[15589.42s -> 15592.22s]  And I got it running in 1080. So i'm happy about that
[15593.02s -> 15595.64s]  Whatever that's protected good
[15600.25s -> 15603.26s]  All right, I need to
[15603.58s -> 15607.85s]  What are you up to?
[15607.85s -> 15609.53s]  I think it's time
[15609.53s -> 15614.48s]  Is he watering good job. All right, so we need
[15616.89s -> 15618.25s]  What else do I need?
[15618.25s -> 15625.90s]  I'm sure this will probably tell me you have become well established
[15626.62s -> 15631.26s]  Our combined strength is becoming greater. We're gonna do an attack near lethys
[15631.34s -> 15635.34s]  It will become more essential to have your miracle skills in top form
[15636.06s -> 15639.44s]  For this you must experience the benefit of gestures
[15640.94s -> 15645.56s]  Can charge miracles without having to return to your temple to select them
[15645.72s -> 15648.84s]  Here comes a fight move your hand in a spiral like this
[15652.92s -> 15657.80s]  Now select the miracle of your choice grain is selected like this
[15658.52s -> 15660.52s]  Oh god
[15666.27s -> 15671.55s]  I can't see the symbols in the bottom right rise to the bottom right of the screen. They're cut off from me, too
[15672.43s -> 15673.87s]  Damn it
[15673.87s -> 15675.87s]  You try it now. Okay
[15677.26s -> 15679.26s]  um
[15702.65s -> 15705.45s]  Oh for the love of god, I can't see them
[15707.68s -> 15713.68s]  I can't see
[15715.04s -> 15719.76s]  You should practice your gestures go on and press this town over here, okay
[15720.88s -> 15722.92s]  fireball
[15722.92s -> 15724.92s]  They look like they're in a bad way
[15725.32s -> 15727.32s]  No food or wood
[15727.40s -> 15733.32s]  Why don't you create some food for their village store while I supply them with wood?
[15734.04s -> 15739.56s]  Hmm that's a good idea you have people worshiping at your worship site
[15743.07s -> 15745.07s]  I have to get rid of the fallout wait
[15745.76s -> 15747.20s]  Wait, hold on
[15747.20s -> 15757.53s]  Did that go straight up and straight down? What?
[15758.51s -> 15763.31s]  Why did that happen?
[15763.31s -> 15768.00s]  Is everyone all right?
[15768.00s -> 15776.97s]  Oh, thank god. I didn't hit a building. Okay. I need to get I need to go to my worship site thing

[24241.05s -> 24243.23s]  No

[24244.91s -> 24246.91s]  I'm so sad right now
[24247.15s -> 24249.39s]  We're about we're about to get really get rolling
[24250.11s -> 24256.81s]  It was pretty recently, right?
[24256.81s -> 24258.81s]  He wants to do something generous
[24269.05s -> 24273.93s]  Your temple is built excellent. What the fuck are you talking about?
[24284.72s -> 24291.82s]  What this is my land leave?
[24292.22s -> 24293.42s]  Save
[24293.42s -> 24295.98s]  Load the auto save this this is the auto save
[24304.03s -> 24307.50s]  What happened?
[24307.50s -> 24309.50s]  It can't be hold on
[24310.60s -> 24312.60s]  No, what the fuck was that?
[24316.24s -> 24318.88s]  What? Oh, no, no, no
[24319.52s -> 24321.52s]  No, it's did it just save it right there?
[24325.05s -> 24327.05s]  Oh, did I just fuck it? Is it over?
[24327.37s -> 24330.33s]  Because I I exited the game and it saved it after I exited the game
[24332.44s -> 24335.08s]  No, it it it loads up the auto save every time
[24336.97s -> 24339.29s]  That I I exited the game once and came back
[24342.62s -> 24345.10s]  Oh, no, that's so horrible. Hold on
[24345.66s -> 24351.80s]  Let me see if there's like more than one
[24355.23s -> 24357.39s]  Because no, I mean you remember like an hour or two ago
[24357.95s -> 24362.11s]  When I open I reopened the game and it put us back in the right spot with an auto save
[24362.67s -> 24363.55s]  so
[24363.55s -> 24372.04s]  Let me see
[24372.04s -> 24374.44s]  Let me just see if I go back in what happens
[24375.08s -> 24379.24s]  I want your saves folder. I don't know the hell that is
[24379.96s -> 24382.04s]  Let's see
[24382.04s -> 24384.09s]  black and white
[24384.09s -> 24385.95s]  profiles
[24385.95s -> 24388.59s]  saved games
[24388.59s -> 24390.96s]  All right. I have what the hell?
[24394.62s -> 24397.12s]  8 56 pm
[24397.12s -> 24398.96s]  and then
[24398.96s -> 24401.20s]  No, this is all wrong
[24401.36s -> 24403.36s]  8 56 pm was literally two minutes ago
[24406.00s -> 24409.21s]  I don't think this is correct though
[24409.21s -> 24414.08s]  Let me go in in the temple
[24414.08s -> 24417.84s]  Hey, the 8 56 pm is the one that I just did when I exited
[24420.60s -> 24421.64s]  No
[24421.64s -> 24427.15s]  I'm gonna back up the folder
[24427.15s -> 24430.99s]  This is fucking weird though because all right. So the last apparently saved game I have
[24431.79s -> 24433.79s]  Is from 6 pm
[24435.02s -> 24437.02s]  That's why it went back that far why
[24437.96s -> 24440.84s]  There's been at least four or five different times where it's auto saved
[24441.40s -> 24451.12s]  That's unfortunate. Hold on. Let me just go in and see if I can pick something else
[24454.27s -> 24456.35s]  Oh, I was just getting into it, too
[24457.39s -> 24471.52s]  Let me see what happens. Okay, let's go in the temple
[24474.75s -> 24477.15s]  Yeah, because look at this. This this is completely wrong
[24477.95s -> 24479.95s]  This is literally the beginning of the level
[24480.43s -> 24482.43s]  Not even close like I we've
[24483.15s -> 24485.79s]  I've auto saved like 10. I've I've this is wrong
[24486.59s -> 24489.52s]  Like completely wrong unless the whole thing corrupted and broke
[24490.24s -> 24494.81s]  Which I mean, that's pretty possible. It's a fucking like almost 20 year old game
[24496.12s -> 24498.60s]  Um game options room. What do I try and look at it?
[24503.93s -> 24512.88s]  save game room
[24512.88s -> 24519.28s]  This is the room where you save and load the game the problem with this is though save the game now boys
[24519.84s -> 24526.00s]  Don't save the game click on a picture to zoom into it. I was told by the yellow that this room doesn't work empty frame
[24526.64s -> 24529.39s]  Then type in a save game name

[25146.40s -> 25152.64s]  But the temple has to be moved correctly the architect left an explanation on this signpost. All right, I don't care
[25152.80s -> 25159.08s]  That's that that's not what I care about right now. I care about killing this guy
[25159.88s -> 25167.76s]  I want to do moves
[25168.56s -> 25172.24s]  In the middle of a fight and I did it once
[25172.88s -> 25178.73s]  I wonder if he does it on his own or if I have to command him to do those moves
[25179.45s -> 25194.38s]  All right, let's go

[25255.48s -> 25269.95s]  Did I do it with this my allies have failed me my nemesis have arrived to take control
[25270.35s -> 25283.87s]  Hey destiny, I will be the only god. What is this?
[25284.75s -> 25288.83s]  What about the turtle?
[25288.83s -> 25290.94s]  Oh, no
[25290.94s -> 25292.54s]  Can we save this?

[25296.04s -> 25298.04s]  nemesis no
[25298.54s -> 25302.78s]  Because uh, I know your creature hides a part of the creed inside him
[25303.74s -> 25308.78s]  I do not need it. I already have the power that three combined queens bring
[25308.94s -> 25312.46s]  You and I will use it to destroy you
[25313.42s -> 25324.11s]  What about all these people?
[25324.11s -> 25327.71s]  No
[25327.71s -> 25329.71s]  We didn't get to meet this turtle
[25330.11s -> 25332.11s]  But I still feel sad
[25337.93s -> 25348.83s]  Retrieve the creed from gaza's dead creature. You must not fall into our enemies hand. I have to get it
[25349.47s -> 25355.79s]  As always I will do as you command. I'll send my creature for it now. Oh shit. I gotta get it, too
[25356.35s -> 25369.85s]  All right, go get it
[25369.85s -> 25384.86s]  Okay, uh
[25384.86s -> 25388.94s]  Where's the creature?
[25388.94s -> 25391.10s]  I'm in game. I am not in game
[25407.39s -> 25409.39s]  What is this creature across the whole game?
[25409.87s -> 25415.15s]  Did I fuck it up when I started? He's got an element of the creed. Oh, I must have screwed it up
[25416.67s -> 25420.11s]  He was really far away from when I was fighting him
[25427.56s -> 25439.87s]  He had to run from across the whole map. He's doing the terrible walk
[25446.36s -> 25450.36s]  I can't believe it cuz you're wiped out like a bug
[25451.32s -> 25457.40s]  I understand what the old guide meant now the power of three creeds must be combined
[25457.72s -> 25464.44s]  But nemesis said he has three creeds. Yes, but he's after the others to stop us getting them
[25465.00s -> 25467.00s]  We've got to get them then
[25467.54s -> 25471.53s]  Absolutely
[25471.53s -> 25473.53s]  We need more wood
[25473.93s -> 25475.93s]  What the hell do you want me to do about this?

[25538.73s -> 25540.14s]  um

[26850.17s -> 26856.25s]  No, there ain't time to think the vortex is closing but we don't know what's on the other side
[26856.65s -> 26861.13s]  Our creature is on the other side. That's all we need to know. Let's go
[26866.96s -> 26868.96s]  Is it actually closing get it go go
[26869.52s -> 26879.28s]  Wasn't a trap, but we better find our creature here. He's going to be around here somewhere

[26892.35s -> 26897.47s]  This creature is torturing him. Why is he gonna play for this?
[26897.87s -> 26900.51s]  It looks like those statues are holding him in place
[26901.23s -> 26904.30s]  Oh

[27103.16s -> 27107.00s]  So I don't want to have everybody sitting here potentially for the next two or three hours
[27107.96s -> 27110.65s]  Because then it will be a 10 hour stream
[27111.77s -> 27118.24s]  It will be a 10 hour stream, but we'll see you tomorrow. Let's go back a few days ago

[27143.64s -> 27146.28s]  So some of these things people might be saying might be completely inaccurate

[27455.53s -> 27457.53s]  Let's have a pre-event party in here
[27457.77s -> 27462.03s]  So we had a rave in the restroom and I sent out a snapchat message to everyone
[27464.06s -> 27466.06s]  What the fuck is going on?
[27470.91s -> 27472.91s]  of rave in the bathroom
[27473.77s -> 27476.67s]  well, uh
[27476.67s -> 27478.84s]  bathrooms stink
[27478.92s -> 27482.92s]  I can't be in a public bathroom for more than two or three minutes tops
[27483.40s -> 27487.40s]  It just smells like pee. It smells like wet piss in every public bathroom
[27487.40s -> 27489.72s]  I've ever been a guy, you know what I mean? You know, you guys know what i'm talking about
[27490.28s -> 27492.68s]  It's it's like a wet humid pee smell

[27510.24s -> 27514.72s]  This game nostalgically reminds me of the of a sim copter
[27515.20s -> 27520.94s]  A sim city flight simulator where you do similar tasks like in this game, but flying in a chopper
[27526.04s -> 27528.12s]  I still have to play like sim city for real
[27529.12s -> 27531.68s]  Oh, what's the easy one what's the one that was easy
[27533.84s -> 27536.33s]  cities skylines

[27590.56s -> 27592.56s]  We were in softball league in boston
[27593.88s -> 27596.68s]  And it was probably 23
[27598.28s -> 27600.28s]  24 was the last time I played
[27600.92s -> 27604.24s]  It's been a while. But yeah, it's a lot of fun

[27812.00s -> 27815.12s]  Uh, I actually I did not make germawalk. It is a community emote
[27815.68s -> 27818.27s]  From better twitch.tv. I did not make it
[27820.84s -> 27824.60s]  And another germa pops up as soon as the first germawalks away from the screen
[27825.79s -> 27828.11s]  Um, I don't know. I didn't make it. I just enabled it
[27828.67s -> 27834.33s]  That is a community better twitch tv emote
[27836.88s -> 27840.80s]  I would direct that feedback towards the person that made that emote
[27842.43s -> 27844.43s]  How do I see it? You have to have better twitch tv
[27847.55s -> 27849.92s]  You made it on an alt account
[27849.92s -> 27852.08s]  Lizard amiibo. Thanks for the 1500 bits lizard
[27852.72s -> 27855.48s]  I could make this really long, but I just want to say thank you
[27855.48s -> 27861.40s]  You've had such a positive impact on my life this past year by inspiring me to be kinder and to pursue what I care about
[27866.52s -> 27871.80s]  Thanks for building such an incredible community and helping to convince me that things are going to work out in ways. I don't expect
[27872.36s -> 27878.06s]  That's true. That's the thing about life is
[27878.94s -> 27880.94s]  some things will happen
[27881.02s -> 27883.02s]  That you aren't prepared for
[27883.50s -> 27887.34s]  Some things will happen that you are prepared for some things will happen that you want to have happen
[27887.34s -> 27889.34s]  Some things will happen that you don't want to have happen
[27890.25s -> 27895.53s]  And some things will happen that you want to have happen that you didn't even know you wanted in the first place
[27898.03s -> 27900.03s]  so
[27900.03s -> 27914.09s]  Is it's a weird thing. That's five head. I mean, it's not it's not it wasn't a riddle
[27914.73s -> 27916.73s]  Break it down break down what I said
[27916.73s -> 27920.12s]  Pretty much what i'm saying is life is unpredictable
[27921.45s -> 27924.73s]  And even if you think you want to do something or you want x
[27925.95s -> 27928.41s]  Y might show up
[27928.41s -> 27946.81s]  And you go. Oh, wow. That's fucking awesome. That's exactly what I wanted happens all the time to people that sounds like a riddle
[27948.57s -> 27950.57s]  That's not how what?
[27950.65s -> 27954.17s]  Life is unpredictable. What's this riddle? The streamer is saying
[27954.97s -> 27958.19s]  Hmm
[27958.19s -> 27965.63s]  What is he?
[27965.63s -> 27976.20s]  Anyways, thank you lizard amiibo. Thanks for the 1500 fucking bits. Ooh, I must make stream what say what?

[27982.24s -> 27985.44s]  Tell me how much do you know about your vehicle maintenance? I'm curious. None
[27989.23s -> 27993.31s]  If something bad happened to my car, I would not be able to fix it. I would have to call somebody
[27994.64s -> 27996.64s]  The only thing I know how to do
[27996.72s -> 27999.68s]  Is tell people that I know how to change a tire when I don't
[28002.43s -> 28005.23s]  And i'll tell me you guys can guys can sneer. Yeah
[28006.36s -> 28009.26s]  How many of you do that too?
[28009.26s -> 28013.50s]  Hey, dude, you know how to change a tire, right? Of course I do. What what are you an idiot?
[28013.98s -> 28020.16s]  Oh, okay. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I also don't fucking know how to change a tire and I i'm asking you but
[28020.72s -> 28028.59s]  Nobody knows how to change tire
[28028.59s -> 28031.39s]  The only people that know how to change a tire are car mechanics
[28033.05s -> 28038.73s]  And your dad if he's at least 50 years old nobody else does
[28049.39s -> 28051.95s]  It's so easy. No, it's not. It's very hard. It's impossible
[28052.51s -> 28065.23s]  It's too scary get a jack jacket change tire. No, it's too scary. That's terrifying. That's too scary
[28065.55s -> 28069.39s]  What if what if the car falls on my hands and it flattens like two pancakes? I'm not doing that
[28069.95s -> 28078.06s]  I need like a professional
[28078.06s -> 28091.32s]  That's a level one skill. No a level one skill is turning the shower on like that's that's a level one skill
[28099.07s -> 28104.25s]  No, I don't know shit about car maintenance I know about tire pressure
[28105.13s -> 28106.01s]  and
[28106.01s -> 28108.49s]  When the engine light turns on to take it somewhere
[28110.76s -> 28115.88s]  I also know how to put windshield washer fluid in a car and it's I mean that's not hard
[28116.28s -> 28126.60s]  Why don't I do my own oil? I don't know how to do an oil. Why I don't do my own oil changes
[28128.32s -> 28132.32s]  Why are we talking like this is some basic knowledge everyone changes their own oil
[28135.02s -> 28137.34s]  Guys, there are like burger king type shops
[28137.90s -> 28139.90s]  Every two miles to change oil
[28140.64s -> 28142.64s]  It's one of the biggest businesses in the country
[28155.82s -> 28158.54s]  What is an oil change is like 16 dollars
[28161.05s -> 28174.16s]  It's not like a thousand dollars to have somebody change your oil. It takes 16 minutes
[28177.37s -> 28184.41s]  Uh, all right this this I don't know. I I don't know. I don't know if i'm getting like trolled here, but I don't know anyone
[28185.05s -> 28188.01s]  Out of the dozens of people that I've ever come across in my life
[28189.04s -> 28192.72s]  None of them change their own oil. None. Not one person does not one
[28193.52s -> 28196.24s]  I'm talking to my family. I'm talking friends literally none of them
[28209.55s -> 28210.43s]  rich
[28210.43s -> 28212.35s]  rich guy
[28212.35s -> 28218.59s]  What i'm freaking out right now. How much is an oil change? It's like fucking 20 dollars
[28224.56s -> 28231.20s]  It's 25 bucks and 50 dollars being the most expensive like in the world. It's 20 dollars
[28235.93s -> 28239.77s]  You spent more money on hearthstone cards two or three years ago. Give me a break
[28247.72s -> 28249.72s]  I think I can go get an oil change
[28250.35s -> 28252.35s]  for 20 bucks if
[28253.63s -> 28271.93s]  I didn't spend a cent on hearthstone cards. Somebody did oil change. He's not changing his own oil
[28273.04s -> 28275.20s]  Yeah, i'm not lying on my I don't
[28275.84s -> 28280.08s]  I i'm i'm all right. I'm i'm moving on from biscuit. I just I don't understand how
[28280.72s -> 28282.72s]  I don't change my own oil
[28285.52s -> 28289.92s]  Is like the equivalent of me buying 50 packs of cigarettes every day
[28302.73s -> 28307.53s]  Same energy. That's what i'm saying. That's what i'm see you get it. You get it
[28307.85s -> 28313.60s]  You get it that guy gets it that guy gets it jackie. You get it jackie gets it
[28315.68s -> 28318.80s]  Do I drink the oil? No, i'm saying same energy man
[28320.96s -> 28324.24s]  All right, let's keep going. I don't change my own fucking oil
[28324.96s -> 28327.95s]  nobody does
[28327.95s -> 28330.67s]  I swear twitch chat is like they is
[28331.63s -> 28333.23s]  It does everything
[28333.23s -> 28345.40s]  Dude, I will call every single contact in my phone and say hey, when's the last time you changed your own oil?
[28346.35s -> 28348.11s]  Uh, I don't
[28348.11s -> 28352.68s]  Okay, hang up call the next person. Hey, when was the last time you changed your own oil?

[28364.49s -> 28367.37s]  Yeah, I call somebody. Oh, hey, when's the last time you changed your own oil?
[28368.01s -> 28372.40s]  I'm doing it right now. Why do you not know how to do that? No, I don't
[28372.64s -> 28375.12s]  Ha serves you right you fucking dick
[28379.96s -> 28388.78s]  Sorry, this is my second pack of cigarettes today. How many of you smoked same energy? I like I agree same energy
[28404.12s -> 28412.86s]  I'm so glad this is confusing a lot a ton of people sick. All right, let's keep going. He's insecure about this
[28430.38s -> 28436.14s]  What percent of americans change their own oil? It's less than 20 percent
[28436.86s -> 28443.10s]  It's 18 percent of all the us car-owning population change their own fucking oil
[28453.07s -> 28460.03s]  The strong ones we didn't talk about strong or weak. We talked about how many people actually do the thing you think that everybody does
[28463.32s -> 28465.32s]  No, i'm getting i'm getting

[28544.70s -> 28549.74s]  You can choose any fictional hero or villain and you resort to dinky brained comics
[28550.30s -> 28554.46s]  When we talked about who's the best superhero?
[28559.40s -> 28562.76s]  Any fictional hero or villain and you did dinky brain comics
[28564.84s -> 28566.28s]  What what?

[28589.13s -> 28591.56s]  I mean, I kind of I guess
[28593.16s -> 28597.77s]  What does that make luigi then?
[28597.85s -> 28599.85s]  Does luigi have any superpowers?
[28599.85s -> 28604.22s]  He's a loser
[28604.22s -> 28611.47s]  A sidekick. I mean luigi can jump high too though. Can he?
[28617.92s -> 28618.88s]  Never, okay
[28618.88s -> 28624.08s]  Um, if mario got into a fight with spider-man spider-man would beat the ever-living shit out of mario
[28626.36s -> 28628.84s]  Like if iron man and super mario got in a fight
[28629.40s -> 28631.56s]  Mario's dead in less than five seconds
[28632.43s -> 28634.43s]  Like dead fucking instantly
[28639.02s -> 28642.62s]  Oh, so like luigi can take on thanos apparently
[28645.39s -> 28648.75s]  the guy that walks into a ghost mansion
[28649.47s -> 28651.47s]  and goes
[28651.55s -> 28652.75s]  Ah
[28652.75s -> 28658.75s]  And is scared of little kids ghosts and as a vacuum cleaner can beat up spider-man
[28660.16s -> 28673.63s]  Am I actually hearing this?
[28673.63s -> 28676.96s]  He's so mad
[28676.96s -> 28678.96s]  Like you aren't afraid of ghosts
[28679.20s -> 28680.88s]  um, but
[28680.88s -> 28684.36s]  If you're a superhero
[28684.36s -> 28687.48s]  You don't he's not a superhero. He's like a fun. Cool
[28688.26s -> 28690.26s]  interesting guy that jumps high
[28691.84s -> 28693.12s]  and
[28693.12s -> 28695.12s]  Spider-man would beat the shit out of him
[28698.14s -> 28702.32s]  Spider-man would just have to like and over his mouth and he'd be like
[28705.95s -> 28708.75s]  And then spider-man would just do a roundhouse kick to his head his head would explode
[28709.55s -> 28711.55s]  That's what happens. This is what would happen
[28716.24s -> 28718.48s]  He's like fucking four feet tall
[28727.93s -> 28729.93s]  They have too many lives
[28738.32s -> 28740.32s]  This is a playground argument
[28749.21s -> 28750.81s]  Luigi would use his
[28750.81s -> 28757.82s]  spider-man is
[28757.82s -> 28761.42s]  This is yeah, i'm thinking about yeah, it's a playground argument. Fuck it. We're out here
[28762.38s -> 28764.38s]  a sad vega thanks for the
[28765.07s -> 28766.89s]  250 again
[28766.89s -> 28771.21s]  They say also happy new year's I didn't get a chance to say it at new year's because I didn't want to keep you longer
[28772.01s -> 28776.57s]  And you were gonna be late. Just know that the reason we donate so much is because we know you will do so much amazing things
[28777.13s -> 28779.76s]  That we don't see anywhere else
[28779.76s -> 28782.64s]  I've actually had a couple of meetings over the last week
[28783.52s -> 28785.24s]  There's some
[28785.24s -> 28788.44s]  crazy shit
[28788.44s -> 28792.92s]  There's some fucked up shit that's gonna be happening that will rival the carnival
[28793.92s -> 28795.92s]  That's happening this year
[28795.92s -> 28800.97s]  And when I it it might even be bigger than the carnival in regards to scope
[28802.00s -> 28807.04s]  It's gonna be fucking wild. I cannot wait until I get to really start to work on it
[28816.75s -> 28819.31s]  It is it is not not carnival related
[28819.95s -> 28825.24s]  But it's in that same scope
[28825.32s -> 28828.04s]  And it's not even off the ground yet, but I know it will be
[28828.68s -> 28831.82s]  It's gonna be a lot of fun
[28831.82s -> 28833.82s]  But yeah, happy new year to you as well. Thank you
[28835.76s -> 28840.08s]  Uh, yeah jack up. Thanks for the thousand bits germa say i'm the joker baby
[28840.80s -> 28842.92s]  I just did
[28842.92s -> 28846.44s]  I don't know why you want me to do that. But thank you though. Thank you bob boy for the 1500 bits
[28846.44s -> 28849.16s]  Please play through half-life series in preparation for half-life alex
[28849.80s -> 28851.00s]  for
[28851.00s -> 28853.80s]  Half-life one play on easy no joke the game could be too hard
[28855.76s -> 28857.28s]  I've played half-life
[28857.28s -> 28863.53s]  Before and the other difficulties. I think i'll be all right. I beat dusk on the hardest differ. I'll be all right
[28864.17s -> 28867.18s]  Thank you bob boy though for the 1500
[28870.17s -> 28873.13s]  Also, we're gonna do the end of a few days ago and then we can move on to today
[28874.65s -> 28880.09s]  25 dr. Pepper. Thanks for the 250 sure coke gaming is cool. But what about dr. Pepper gaming? You'll be our next sponsor
[28880.57s -> 28882.57s]  Also, are you planning on playing resident evil 3?
[28883.68s -> 28885.68s]  When the new one comes out? Yeah
[28885.74s -> 28887.76s]  Absolutely
[28887.76s -> 28893.20s]  I don't think dr. Pepper has anything to do with games or sponsors or anything. They're kind of they just kind of do their own thing
[28896.24s -> 28898.24s]  They just they do their own thing. They don't really
[28898.88s -> 28900.64s]  I don't think they're involved anywhere
[28900.64s -> 28905.23s]  You know what i'm saying?
[28905.23s -> 28910.03s]  But anyways, thank you to celestial ogia or logia for the 500 bits
[28910.59s -> 28912.43s]  I want to say thank you jeremy
[28912.43s -> 28916.19s]  I had the fortune to catch an upload of your new year's eve stream the other day
[28916.75s -> 28922.59s]  And while you've made me laugh my face off plenty of times in recent years. It was really your offense authenticity that charmed me
[28923.39s -> 28927.87s]  Well, you've been a joy to me in this chapter of my life. I'm even happier that you've been a joy to so many others
[28928.51s -> 28931.07s]  Thanks for being so mindful of other people's words
[28931.87s -> 28937.07s]  I never had a brother but i'm happy to think of you as mine take care of yourself and goodbye
[28938.11s -> 28950.86s]  It was really sweet. It's the first time i've ever been called somebody's brother and not
[28952.62s -> 28954.62s]  Their grandfather
[28954.62s -> 28959.32s]  Or their weird like scary uncle. So thanks for that
[28965.00s -> 28968.01s]  Thanks
[28968.01s -> 28969.77s]  Really appreciate it
[28969.77s -> 28973.45s]  Hey gnarly. Thanks for the 250. Sorry about talking about katana zero for like the 20th time
[28973.45s -> 28977.37s]  But I saw it on the pole in the pre-stream chat. I hope you end up playing it. It's good
[28978.33s -> 28981.69s]  That's the plan this week. I'm probably gonna play it before uh next week
[28983.15s -> 28987.15s]  Apple shift. Thanks for 250. Hey, do you have a set date for the next community content night? No, I don't
[28987.95s -> 28991.45s]  But let's take a look at the calendar might as well do it now
[28995.23s -> 28997.45s]  so
[28997.45s -> 29004.17s]  two three
[29005.13s -> 29008.33s]  Ladies and gentlemen, the next community content night is going to be
[29009.13s -> 29013.16s]  on saturday the 18th
[29013.16s -> 29016.38s]  There you go
[29016.38s -> 29019.42s]  Figured because I did say I want to do it the first and this first and second week
[29020.62s -> 29027.10s]  Somewhere into mid january. So that makes sense on the 18th. We'll do the uh, the next uh string of community content stuff
[29027.74s -> 29029.64s]  and then hopefully soon
[29029.64s -> 29031.56s]  uh, I can get
[29031.56s -> 29034.44s]  my shit taken care of so I can not be a
[29035.79s -> 29040.75s]  Broken body piece of shit and actually be able to get in front of the green screen and move around a lot
[29042.91s -> 29044.75s]  uh my old
[29044.75s -> 29046.36s]  body
[29046.36s -> 29050.28s]  Actually, I went to the memory. I told you I went to the doctor that was a specialist
[29051.88s -> 29053.93s]  and
[29053.93s -> 29056.01s]  we're probably gonna have to do
[29057.29s -> 29058.57s]  a
[29058.57s -> 29060.57s]  nerve blocking injection
[29062.81s -> 29065.42s]  Is what I was told
[29065.42s -> 29069.44s]  Because he he was under the assumption. He's like, I think you do have costochondritis
[29070.38s -> 29072.86s]  And there's not really much anybody can do for it
[29073.58s -> 29075.02s]  besides
[29075.02s -> 29080.46s]  doing steroid injections
[29080.52s -> 29083.96s]  apparently
[29083.96s -> 29089.20s]  Those of you that have no idea what's going on what i'm talking about. Um, I have a hiatal hernia
[29090.16s -> 29092.80s]  but every doctor I talked to said that they don't think that's
[29093.44s -> 29095.76s]  Really the reason why i'm in like pain all the time
[29096.40s -> 29100.40s]  They think it's because I have costochondritis, which is inflammation in your rib cage
[29101.12s -> 29105.76s]  In the joints that connect your chest and your back, you know, like where your ribs connect to your spine
[29106.96s -> 29109.60s]  And where your ribs actually your breastbone connects to your rib cage
[29110.56s -> 29113.52s]  Apparently there's inflammation in there and there's not much that can really be done
[29114.32s -> 29116.16s]  so, um
[29116.16s -> 29120.64s]  If that is the complete and total diagnosis from two or three different doctors
[29122.35s -> 29128.51s]  That you do injections you do steroid injections and sometimes you do like a nerve blocking steroid injection and it goes away forever
[29129.15s -> 29131.47s]  We'll see. How does it happen? Nobody knows
[29132.83s -> 29134.83s]  uh hereditary
[29135.95s -> 29138.51s]  Is just kind of just one of those things. It's just inflammation. I also have
[29139.55s -> 29143.15s]  You guys know, I mean apparently it's an autoimmune bullshit, right?
[29143.95s -> 29146.75s]  Because I have and i've been diagnosed with in the past
[29147.77s -> 29149.77s]  colitis and
[29150.48s -> 29151.92s]  the
[29151.92s -> 29155.28s]  inflammatory bowel disease shit and that's also autoimmune so
[29156.56s -> 29158.70s]  it's
[29158.70s -> 29164.94s]  Essentially, he said you probably have costochondritis because it's autoimmune and you already have autoimmune problems in the first place. So
[29165.74s -> 29167.98s]  There you go
[29167.98s -> 29171.93s]  for those of you that don't know what's what i'm talking about and what it means is
[29172.73s -> 29174.73s]  I don't my range of motion is
[29174.73s -> 29178.41s]  Limited tilting hurts bending over hurts
[29179.05s -> 29180.65s]  Leading backwards hurts
[29180.65s -> 29182.81s]  Um, and when I fell down in the chair on new year's eve
[29183.77s -> 29188.33s]  It was okay. Uh, the next day, uh, my chest was like in a ton of pain
[29189.45s -> 29191.45s]  Like I actually was like
[29192.49s -> 29196.24s]  Like the next fucking day
[29196.24s -> 29198.24s]  The ultimate fall joke
[29198.83s -> 29200.73s]  That wasn't a joke
[29200.73s -> 29205.05s]  But we'll move on we don't have to talk about it. Uh, i'm fine. I'm gonna be good to go
[29206.01s -> 29210.33s]  And I just have to do one more test and then maybe we'll be
[29212.25s -> 29214.25s]  Sticking a needle in my rib cage
[29216.24s -> 29219.04s]  Sounds weird. Okay, but anyways, we'll go
[29220.09s -> 29224.73s]  Locchio locchio. Thanks for the five dollars total if you stop playing this game right now. I'll give you the rest of my bits
[29225.45s -> 29233.04s]  Thanks for honoring my bits. Here's the rest of them. I did do that. You're right and that catches us up to now
[29233.84s -> 29236.84s]  Which we can go back
[29236.92s -> 29239.48s]  Let's go go go right here actually, it's not very much
[29240.20s -> 29243.58s]  We'll get through this pretty quickly
[29243.58s -> 29245.74s]  We had what did we have? What did we have?
[29246.30s -> 29249.29s]  today
[29249.29s -> 29251.29s]  I was just turned on the cam which would have been bad
[29253.02s -> 29262.12s]  Let's do this one. Let's go back to earlier this afternoon. We had 250 from peaceful hailey jeremy
[29262.92s -> 29265.16s]  I wanted to ask you what do you do for fun off stream?
[29265.80s -> 29267.80s]  What's a typical germa day?
[29269.16s -> 29271.16s]  Um pretty boring actually
[29274.17s -> 29276.73s]  grocery shopping
[29276.73s -> 29280.49s]  Do errands I get stuff for the next streams
[29281.37s -> 29286.24s]  You know most of the stuff that you see that just appears on streams randomly or things that I get are things that I do
[29286.32s -> 29288.72s]  It's usually set up a day or two before I stream
[29291.32s -> 29293.87s]  uh
[29293.87s -> 29295.64s]  Go to the dinner
[29295.64s -> 29297.64s]  You know kim and I will spend time together
[29298.28s -> 29302.04s]  Go see a movie
[29302.04s -> 29304.84s]  Sometimes it's nice just to kind of chill take a bath, you know
[29308.51s -> 29311.95s]  I contrary to maybe some popular belief. I live a pretty
[29312.83s -> 29314.27s]  boring
[29314.27s -> 29317.56s]  Private life
[29317.56s -> 29319.56s]  You know, I take take my dog out
[29320.73s -> 29321.93s]  I eat
[29321.93s -> 29326.22s]  I hang out with my girlfriend
[29326.30s -> 29328.30s]  I don't really do much else
[29328.70s -> 29330.70s]  besides preparing streams
[29330.86s -> 29338.56s]  And I sometimes like, you know go out, you know, if friends are in town or if we want to do something we'll
[29339.12s -> 29341.52s]  Oh, you know today. Well, we're gonna go to the strip today, right?
[29341.60s -> 29346.80s]  We've done I mean kim and I have gone out to the strip where you know downtown vegas a lot of times
[29348.32s -> 29351.64s]  But pretty basic normal stuff
[29352.12s -> 29362.40s]  No, the strip not a strip club another oil change servant. What?
[29363.12s -> 29368.48s]  Zeke thanks for the 250. I turned 22 today and spent my birthday eating microwave dinners and watching your old tf2 videos
[29368.64s -> 29370.64s]  Not like this
[29370.72s -> 29374.56s]  P.s. I know you get this a lot, but your stupid memes have genuinely helped me through stress and shit
[29375.04s -> 29377.04s]  More so than any other internet clown out there
[29379.08s -> 29382.12s]  Well, here's something else that I need to say about that
[29383.69s -> 29384.65s]  is
[29384.65s -> 29388.17s]  Sure, i'm the dude on the camera and i'm the guy that says the lines
[29389.29s -> 29396.25s]  But some of the funniest shit that had has come out of this community has come from people making the memes themselves
[29397.37s -> 29400.57s]  some of the most interesting stuff
[29401.76s -> 29406.32s]  comes from the community and the things that how you interpret the things that I say or how you
[29407.12s -> 29409.20s]  Create something out of something that I do or say
[29410.52s -> 29412.09s]  so
[29412.09s -> 29416.27s]  It's not just me
[29416.27s -> 29419.79s]  You guys come up with a lot of funny shit too based on this community, so
[29421.08s -> 29424.73s]  We should be the streamer
[29424.73s -> 29426.73s]  Jerma, you're the muse though
[29430.60s -> 29436.75s]  Hey potion dweller, thanks for the 250. I know exactly how today is going to go. Okay. Well, let's see
[29437.63s -> 29440.99s]  You will start out a very egotistical yet benevolent god
[29441.71s -> 29445.07s]  Then you'll accidentally kill someone and we'll all go d colon
[29445.95s -> 29447.95s]  Then someone will actually offend you
[29448.59s -> 29451.15s]  And you become a murderous psychopath petty god
[29458.59s -> 29464.64s]  I don't think it was that accurate
[29464.64s -> 29466.64s]  I didn't accidentally kill somebody
[29467.21s -> 29470.81s]  I intentionally killed a few people. I intentionally ate a few people
[29472.56s -> 29474.80s]  I ate that dead guy
[29474.80s -> 29476.80s]  Right, like that wasn't by accident. I
[29477.68s -> 29483.52s]  I ate the dead guy like that was not by accident. It wasn't on
[29484.56s -> 29488.40s]  Remember when he threw the rock at the crowd. Oh, does anybody have that clip?
[29490.51s -> 29495.31s]  Seriously, does anybody have the clip of when he throws the rock into the crowd? It's like
[29495.87s -> 29497.39s]  Fucking hilarious
[29497.39s -> 29499.42s]  Where is it?
[29499.42s -> 29503.13s]  Somebody has to have it
[29503.13s -> 29505.13s]  with the common psycho
[29508.32s -> 29513.76s]  It was so stupid. I was just trying to teach him how to like lift rocks
[29515.66s -> 29516.86s]  There it is
[29516.86s -> 29520.22s]  This is what I want. I need this in my life right now
[29522.99s -> 29525.23s]  No, not this
[29525.23s -> 29527.55s]  This is also funny, but not this one
[29529.21s -> 29532.57s]  Oh my god
[29532.57s -> 29536.57s]  Not this here I still will watch this still I guess this is fucking funny, too
[29542.80s -> 29546.89s]  Hey
[29552.92s -> 29558.84s]  What where's the other one where's the one from all the way here we go jerma's evil son
[29559.64s -> 29565.16s]  Jerma's evil son massacres innocent. Stop working. Hey, you're supposed to be stuck in there
[29566.83s -> 29568.83s]  Hold on. I need this. I
[29571.71s -> 29573.71s]  No, stop just throwing it
[29575.12s -> 29577.12s]  You just broke it
[29579.58s -> 29585.10s]  Where is it he goes with a rock?
[29590.80s -> 29595.42s]  You don't give a fuck man, oh he goes back throws it at the builder
[29602.78s -> 29604.78s]  Right here look at all these people
[29610.92s -> 29612.92s]  Stop
[29619.31s -> 29621.31s]  Stop stop stop it
[29621.55s -> 29625.39s]  He's killing everybody. It's not it. That's not it. Where's he throw the boulder?
[29627.26s -> 29633.60s]  He throws the boulder
[29633.84s -> 29636.57s]  That's not even it
[29636.57s -> 29640.33s]  Where does he he whips the boulder and it hits like 15 people
[29642.36s -> 29648.09s]  Somebody's got it. It's it's right after that. Yeah
[29649.80s -> 29653.39s]  Watch the full video
[29653.39s -> 29655.39s]  It's right there. No, wait, you see
[29656.59s -> 29658.59s]  He cries and he picks a folder
[29660.67s -> 29663.55s]  No, i'll find it some of it. We've lost control. Is that it?
[29668.28s -> 29671.16s]  This is the funniest shit i've seen like at least in 2020
[29680.16s -> 29682.72s]  Yeah, this is but this is by far the funniest thing i've seen in 2020
[29683.36s -> 29687.20s]  It's only been eight days. I know but still it's gonna be hard to top this for now
[29687.76s -> 29693.02s]  What's going on internet? Let's go. It's buffering. What am I buffering?
[29693.66s -> 29696.80s]  stop
[29702.19s -> 29704.19s]  Oh stop stop
[29705.07s -> 29707.07s]  He's looking at his eyes
[29707.55s -> 29711.20s]  Stop
[29715.20s -> 29717.44s]  Why would he do that
[29718.32s -> 29720.32s]  He's crying
[29721.20s -> 29723.20s]  He's looking at his eyes
[29729.39s -> 29741.79s]  You don't do that. Oh, that was so funny. What an absolute psychopath
[29745.74s -> 29750.40s]  Anyways
[29750.40s -> 29752.64s]  Thank you to potion dwellers
[29754.24s -> 29756.44s]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
[29756.44s -> 29759.45s]  Really appreciate it
[29759.45s -> 29761.29s]  also, we had
[29761.29s -> 29763.29s]  a thousand bits from
[29763.77s -> 29766.27s]  Suck your bus
[29766.27s -> 29771.71s]  And it was watch this on stream where no balls is salty swamp. So this is a great series. What are you talking about?
[29772.03s -> 29774.43s]  I mean, i'm not gonna watch it. It's like a 10 minute video
[29775.96s -> 29777.96s]  That's blordow's cartoon
[29778.20s -> 29781.68s]  It's old
[29781.68s -> 29783.04s]  But it's good
[29783.04s -> 29787.44s]  That's like 15 sick. That's like 16 years old
[29790.20s -> 29792.44s]  I think we've watched it on stream before
[29793.00s -> 29797.15s]  I'm certain we have
[29797.15s -> 29801.53s]  dermalore
[29801.53s -> 29803.77s]  Uh, watch this on stream. Not right now
[29804.57s -> 29811.32s]  No, watch joel's movie. I gotta we're gonna watch public domain movie night. We'll watch a bunch of movies queue them up
[29817.50s -> 29820.22s]  I promise we will watch it. We're gonna do a public domain movie night
[29820.86s -> 29829.23s]  But thank you suck your bus for the thousand bits. Thanks for the 1500 bits from bulbous swag desu
[29830.96s -> 29834.40s]  15 dollars. Thanks a lot for that. I'm so happy. I recommended this game like a billion times
[29834.40s -> 29836.40s]  I used to play it all the time as a kid
[29837.47s -> 29839.58s]  Yeah, it's fantastic
[29839.58s -> 29841.58s]  We'll probably be playing it again tomorrow
[29841.90s -> 29845.72s]  At least for a little while. I feel like there's still a little bit more to see
[29846.44s -> 29853.05s]  We'll see
[29853.05s -> 29856.17s]  Uh trampston gave five community subs. I think I missed it. But thank you trampston
[29858.47s -> 29861.77s]  phylacter lich gave five thousand bits again
[29862.89s -> 29864.17s]  again
[29864.17s -> 29868.59s]  Another 50 dollars name your god larry or we will riot. We'll get a proper name for the cow
[29869.31s -> 29874.75s]  I gotta have to really think about it. I didn't I was gonna say something but I didn't want to just jump on a random
[29876.64s -> 29882.14s]  Name and that's what the name is. No, no, no, I want to think about it. It's not going to be mega milk. Absolutely
[29882.14s -> 29884.14s]  No, sorry guys
[29885.36s -> 29888.56s]  Uh behemoth. Thanks for the 250. I I say it repeated
[29889.12s -> 29891.12s]  repent for being late
[29891.20s -> 29895.04s]  I just said it whatever and now I have to apologize for saying that i'm sorry
[29895.04s -> 29898.16s]  I just said that bulbous swag desu again 1500 bits again
[29899.12s -> 29903.21s]  On top of your 1500 to 30 dollars total here. Thank you bulbous way
[29904.49s -> 29908.73s]  I wasn't able to get this game to work when I tried a few weeks ago, but this tutorial goes on forever
[29908.97s -> 29910.01s]  Yeah
[29910.01s -> 29915.52s]  It is a pain in the ass to get to run on anything over windows 7
[29916.24s -> 29920.25s]  So those of you that want to play this game yourself, just be wary
[29921.13s -> 29924.41s]  It's a absolute mess to get it to run on new computers
[29929.63s -> 29931.63s]  Uh flinsenberg. Thanks for five community subs
[29934.57s -> 29937.13s]  Thank you flinsenberg
[29937.13s -> 29942.25s]  Germa put some chips in f germa put sun chips in f tier. Thanks for the 500 bits
[29943.48s -> 29944.52s]  I did
[29944.52s -> 29945.96s]  I just don't like them
[29945.96s -> 29950.76s]  I prayed I prayed this to you god germa so that you may show us your heavenly gigantic
[29953.69s -> 29958.27s]  Feet it's not what you guys thought it was gonna be also
[29958.27s -> 29961.39s]  Is there a chance that you'll play outer wilds in the future? Yes, it's on the table
[29963.64s -> 29965.64s]  I have a list over here with
[29966.44s -> 29971.00s]  50 plus games at this point that are all gonna get played. It's all early 2020 plans
[29971.80s -> 29972.84s]  So yes
[29972.84s -> 29975.28s]  I will be playing outer wilds. I promise
[29978.35s -> 29982.35s]  Topac thanks for the 250. Happy late new year couldn't send bits for the super late streams
[29982.99s -> 29988.03s]  Now that you're starting early, i'm so glad I can catch them again. It's been a wild four years since that i'm watching your channel
[29988.35s -> 29993.39s]  It's grown like crazy. I'm so happy for you. Keep it up. Everyone watches you for a reason
[29994.94s -> 29997.44s]  I hope so
[29997.44s -> 29999.44s]  All I can say back to you guys is
[30000.08s -> 30003.68s]  As the channel grows i'm gonna try to do more and more things that I wanted to try
[30006.48s -> 30008.80s]  We cross 10 000 fucking subs
[30009.36s -> 30014.24s]  I'm gonna do some shit that I may never have ever been able to do and may never be able to do ever again
[30015.20s -> 30018.00s]  You know i'm saying like i'm i'm I want to try new things
[30018.88s -> 30022.40s]  I promise i'll do even less imagine if I said that
[30029.76s -> 30032.11s]  So yeah
[30032.11s -> 30034.11s]  I'm gonna i'm gonna keep rolling
[30034.27s -> 30035.87s]  We'll see what happens. Right?
[30035.87s -> 30042.57s]  But thank you topac and yes, you can expect the streams to start pulled back where I
[30043.45s -> 30045.45s]  Was a couple months ago
[30045.53s -> 30048.09s]  around 1 to 2 pm pacific time
[30050.42s -> 30052.42s]  indefinitely for the foreseeable future
[30053.00s -> 30056.57s]  How did black and white go? It was very fun. It was a ton of fun
[30059.26s -> 30061.34s]  I told you it was I told you it was gonna be a hit
[30063.42s -> 30069.96s]  Do you remember the first like 20 minutes of the stream? I'm just saying
[30077.60s -> 30084.40s]  There was a lot of resident sleeper next game resident fuck and I told you you resident sleeper in half-life one right now
[30085.04s -> 30087.20s]  And I looked over and there was at least 100 people that were like good
[30087.28s -> 30092.14s]  I would do that for half-life one as well and i'm like fuck. Oh, how do I please this person?
[30097.82s -> 30100.38s]  It really starts to pop off when you get the creatures. Yeah
[30108.88s -> 30111.12s]  But thank you public for the 500 bits
[30111.84s -> 30118.09s]  And watching you as long as I can remember now i'm in my second semester of college and subbed to you for almost 18 months
[30118.97s -> 30121.37s]  Sincerely, thanks for everything. Oh and chat. You're cool, too
[30124.49s -> 30126.49s]  Chat is pretty cool. Yeah, I agree
[30126.57s -> 30132.52s]  Like some you know, sometimes they can resident sleeper of one of the best pc games
[30133.32s -> 30134.20s]  ever
[30134.20s -> 30137.26s]  You know and you know you let it slide
[30140.89s -> 30145.45s]  All right. I may I may have flown off the I may have flown off the handle there
[30146.01s -> 30149.13s]  Uh, this probably isn't the top 10 best pc game ever made
[30150.09s -> 30156.01s]  Um, the series is up there with some of people's most beloved cult classic video games ever made. I probably should have said that
[30160.54s -> 30162.22s]  I mean it might be
[30162.22s -> 30164.22s]  it paved the way for a lot of
[30165.32s -> 30168.44s]  Because lion head made this game and then everybody was like, oh wow
[30168.84s -> 30175.08s]  Having choices and and having powers and having ai control themselves and do weird things and people took it and you know, it was
[30176.04s -> 30184.24s]  It's pretty classic
[30184.24s -> 30189.68s]  Hey bulbous swag, thanks for the 1500 more bits on top of the already 30 you gave
[30190.48s -> 30192.48s]  Thank you bulbous swag. They said get the cow. I did
[30193.87s -> 30196.19s]  Classic doesn't mean good. But in this case it does
[30197.07s -> 30201.37s]  We also have to remember this is almost this is like 20 years old
[30202.11s -> 30204.91s]  It's like a six 15 16 year old game something like that
[30205.63s -> 30208.75s]  Can you imagine what this was like playing this?
[30209.39s -> 30213.31s]  When you could be good or evil and it was one of the first times you could ever do that
[30214.54s -> 30218.38s]  You still got the original box I got the original box too. It's pretty awesome
[30220.36s -> 30221.96s]  Came out in 2001
[30221.96s -> 30223.37s]  right
[30223.37s -> 30226.76s]  See
[30226.76s -> 30234.24s]  Show the box. I don't have any clothes on I can't i'll show it tomorrow. The second one wasn't as good, but it was fun
[30235.47s -> 30238.67s]  Yeah, I feel like we won't be spending as much time in black and white, too
[30240.54s -> 30245.95s]  Maybe like I said, i'm willing to give these games a good full two streams
[30246.67s -> 30250.19s]  I feel like we just opened up everything. So
[30253.13s -> 30255.26s]  Well, yeah, thank you. Pubble
[30255.26s -> 30259.34s]  Thank you for the 18 months in a row of your subscription. Thank you bulbous swag for the 1500
[30259.90s -> 30262.46s]  We did get the cow tar alecran. Thanks for the 250
[30263.82s -> 30266.62s]  The other day in chat people were telling you that bananas were radioactive
[30267.18s -> 30269.58s]  I went along with the bit because I thought it was funny
[30269.98s -> 30276.64s]  But I was watching a science video the other day and it turns out that not only are they radioactive but they reliably produce anti-matter
[30277.18s -> 30279.66s]  the most dangerous and volatile substance in the universe
[30280.38s -> 30283.82s]  On average a single banana will produce a particle of anti-matter every 70 minutes
[30284.78s -> 30287.40s]  This is as horseshit
[30289.29s -> 30294.65s]  You made the whole thing up
[30294.65s -> 30296.65s]  Thanks for the 250 though
[30297.78s -> 30308.38s]  Appreciate it. Look it up. Do I actually have to write this?
[30309.69s -> 30314.89s]  bananas anti-matter
[30314.89s -> 30320.28s]  This is real the average banana rich in potassium produces
[30321.30s -> 30331.77s]  Positron roughly once every 75 minutes. This feels like a fake website
[30337.34s -> 30340.30s]  Okay, the top two sources for this are the same website
[30347.00s -> 30354.88s]  Antimatter particle in bananas. Hold on. Is it maybe it is
[30355.52s -> 30358.78s]  quantum
[30358.78s -> 30362.78s]  Today I learned. Oh, here's reddit today. I learned bananas produce anti-matter. Let's say
[30362.78s -> 30367.10s]  Okay, let's see if somebody in the first comment goes actually you're fucking stupid. Let's see
[30367.66s -> 30377.32s]  Between this and the radiation thing i'm becoming increasingly distrustful of bananas and I really don't need that in my life
[30384.20s -> 30387.24s]  This and the radiation thing are the same thing
[30387.80s -> 30394.04s]  Wow, what a terrible sentence bananas contain potassium a small percentage of all naturally occurring potassium
[30394.44s -> 30400.12s]  Is in the form of potassium 40 potassium 40 decays through all three kinds of beta decay
[30400.76s -> 30406.60s]  Most of it is electron emission some of its electron capture and a tiny percentage is positron emission
[30407.08s -> 30409.08s]  It's a very small
[30409.14s -> 30413.32s]  arguably negligible amount of radiation the banana equivalent dose
[30414.73s -> 30416.73s]  Is 0.1
[30417.29s -> 30424.97s]  Weird usv in contrast you actually receive 10 usv background radiation per day on average
[30425.51s -> 30429.53s]  100 times more than eating a fucking banana. I said that to you guys
[30430.49s -> 30437.90s]  It's three weeks ago. There's this also you need potassium to live
[30445.07s -> 30446.92s]  so, um
[30446.92s -> 30451.32s]  You should be able to add this is a great quote from this fucking scientist. This reddit scientist
[30452.35s -> 30453.79s]  uh
[30453.79s -> 30455.95s]  You should actually keep your banana intake below
[30456.49s -> 30458.83s]  2740 bananas a day
[30460.20s -> 30461.40s]  um
[30461.40s -> 30468.68s]  To get below that radiation limit that you get just from it just existing a day. Okay, so be careful guys
[30473.29s -> 30478.27s]  Make sure you don't eat 3000 bananas a day to get the same radiation that you get by existing
[30478.67s -> 30480.67s]  Just standing in your room for a day
[30480.75s -> 30483.07s]  Like I said go in your basement and breathe in once
[30483.87s -> 30487.39s]  You just ate fucking 5000 bananas. Thank you. I'm so glad that we looked that up
[30487.95s -> 30491.29s]  So glad we got over that
[30491.29s -> 30498.89s]  Where are we here? Okay
[30498.89s -> 30500.97s]  Parasol, thank you parasol for the thousand bits
[30502.65s -> 30508.49s]  Hey jerma, just wanted to drop it and say I truly appreciate you. It's my dream to see you play my own game someday
[30509.29s -> 30511.05s]  until then
[30511.05s -> 30512.92s]  Love you
[30512.92s -> 30514.92s]  Until then though, but what game?
[30516.03s -> 30520.73s]  What game?
[30520.73s -> 30522.73s]  Never trust a redditor. Why not?
[30526.12s -> 30528.12s]  It's a porn game. You'll see
[30529.32s -> 30532.20s]  Thank you parasol for the thousand bits. I don't think it's a porn game
[30533.00s -> 30535.32s]  Come here. Thanks for the 300 bits. Hey jerma, i'm pretty late
[30535.32s -> 30538.84s]  But just want to say thanks for the kind words on my xaraxos poster on the content night
[30539.56s -> 30544.12s]  Really made all the work. I put into it worth it. Can't wait for the next one. It was awesome. So thank you
[30545.42s -> 30547.02s]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
[30547.02s -> 30550.48s]  But he said why not?
[30550.48s -> 30552.48s]  No, I can't play a porn game on stream
[30553.20s -> 30556.32s]  I can't i'm not gonna i'm not gonna play a porn game anyways. Why would I play a porn game?
[30559.68s -> 30561.68s]  Uh, thank you non a
[30561.92s -> 30564.32s]  Ha ar for the 250
[30565.12s -> 30569.52s]  Glad I can once again donate to the best streamer on twitch. I was so happy watching the award stream. You deserve every cent
[30570.16s -> 30573.76s]  Since you took me up on my black and white game recommendation. It was recommended a lot
[30574.24s -> 30578.00s]  So yeah, I told you guys how long till you give it and play dragon rampa probably never
[30579.40s -> 30581.00s]  Like black and white
[30581.00s -> 30583.34s]  This is my jam. You know what I mean?
[30583.98s -> 30587.26s]  I don't think i'll play in one of those. I don't think i'm gonna play dragon rumple
[30589.69s -> 30591.69s]  Probably never i'm just gonna be real
[30592.60s -> 30596.60s]  Stuff like I people say play dragon rompa play doki-doki literature club play
[30597.48s -> 30601.32s]  This game play this. I don't i'm really not into them. I really don't I don't play them
[30602.12s -> 30605.32s]  What's it called? What's it? What's it called?
[30606.75s -> 30611.95s]  Drag was it called?
[30611.95s -> 30613.95s]  dangan dangan ronpa
[30616.70s -> 30618.70s]  What am I saying dragon rompa?
[30619.10s -> 30622.38s]  I I like it that I I say it better that way dangan rompa
[30625.84s -> 30628.56s]  Probably not though. It's not doesn't look like it's up my alley
[30636.62s -> 30642.14s]  Hey invader z thanks to the 250. Hey jerem. I was wondering when the next community content night is
[30643.69s -> 30644.73s]  uh
[30644.73s -> 30645.85s]  18th
[30645.85s -> 30650.27s]  Also, here's a picture of my rats
[30652.22s -> 30654.38s]  Update a picture. You now have four rats
[30658.88s -> 30660.88s]  It's not good. It's actually okay
[30662.70s -> 30666.86s]  What the game?
[30666.86s -> 30668.86s]  Why you got him in why you got him in this bowl?
[30670.60s -> 30673.00s]  You got like rats in like a bowl. Yeah, look
[30679.74s -> 30681.74s]  That's a bowl with four in there
[30685.18s -> 30688.06s]  I know rats actually like to stuff into each other though, don't they?
[30695.08s -> 30700.12s]  I don't rats notoriously like to just get all on top of each other and like stuff on to into each other and stuff
[30702.03s -> 30713.08s]  That's a rat bowl
[30713.08s -> 30718.92s]  German can't say snuggle. Oh, that's true. That is what that is. Don't say it like that. I
[30726.04s -> 30728.60s]  Stuck I I i'm very literal
[30729.56s -> 30735.00s]  Yes cuddling sure. I'm I'm when I say like stuff into each other. I mean like pushing into each other
[30735.80s -> 30738.70s]  Hey kim mom is i'm not gonna read that
[30739.74s -> 30742.52s]  All right. All right. All right
[30742.52s -> 30748.68s]  But i'm talking in terms of like they press into each other and they roll and press and roll around and
[30749.48s -> 30757.29s]  All right. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done moving on. I gotta get rats
[30757.77s -> 30761.37s]  I want like a lizard too. I want a huge monitor dragon. I want a like a
[30762.09s -> 30767.37s]  Tegu so bad. I want a huge fucking lizard, but like I can't it's just not it's too much
[30768.01s -> 30770.01s]  Hey for raisin
[30770.49s -> 30772.01s]  uh
[30772.01s -> 30774.01s]  Frenzen thanks for the thousand bits
[30779.21s -> 30781.85s]  Thank you for all the laughs over the years germa. This is all I can give for now
[30785.04s -> 30787.13s]  one cent
[30787.13s -> 30789.77s]  Well, you can't even give one cent uh, 25 cents
[30791.07s -> 30796.03s]  Or 25 000 bits. I if you give money to this channel, don't ever think that this is all this is no
[30796.11s -> 30798.35s]  This is all I can give you for now
[30798.35s -> 30800.35s]  Don't feel obligated to give me money
[30801.85s -> 30803.85s]  Thank you for ever even considering it
[30807.44s -> 30809.44s]  Thank you for the thousand bits
[30814.48s -> 30817.44s]  Getting to the end here we have let's get the credits on by the way
[30818.64s -> 30825.80s]  Roll them up there and they come. Thanks all the subs everybody. There's a there are a lot of you now, you know the number
[30827.61s -> 30830.81s]  You know the number of how many people are subbed to this channel
[30831.61s -> 30833.61s]  It's an insane amount of people
[30834.40s -> 30835.95s]  it's
[30835.95s -> 30838.83s]  More than I ever thought that this channel would ever have ever
[30839.90s -> 30842.78s]  so
[30842.78s -> 30846.46s]  Thank you all of you
[30846.46s -> 30850.54s]  Regardless of I know it's a lot of gifted and community subs from new years
[30851.26s -> 30853.90s]  And if regardless if you stick around or not
[30854.94s -> 30861.82s]  This number here is fucking over 10 000 subs is fucking ridiculous. It's absolutely insane
[30862.54s -> 30867.84s]  I hope I use your money. Well
[30867.84s -> 30870.76s]  I plan to
[30870.76s -> 30872.76s]  next goal 20 000 subs
[30873.40s -> 30876.68s]  I don't know about that. That's uh, that's
[30883.92s -> 30885.92s]  At some point I at some point
[30886.56s -> 30890.48s]  You make a movie, you know what I mean? Like that's that's an absolute dick
[30890.72s -> 30892.72s]  That's an absolute shitload of money
[30895.44s -> 30899.44s]  You know at some point you hire danny to veto to fucking like come on streaming like throw an egg at me
[30905.36s -> 30908.96s]  You said dick. I was uh, this is just you know what I mean?
[30910.86s -> 30916.30s]  But regardless of where that number goes up or down. Seriously, it's we crossed the threshold here that
[30917.79s -> 30919.79s]  It seems impossible to cross
[30921.47s -> 30926.33s]  Thanks again guys. There's still a few more bits to do we have uh
[30927.27s -> 30929.44s]  mozzie connie
[30929.52s -> 30931.76s]  Mozzie connie for the mozzie connie
[30932.48s -> 30937.20s]  For a thousand this lot of ten dollar drops tonight a lot of thousand thousand fifteen hundred fifteen hundred. Thanks you
[30937.76s -> 30939.76s]  Seriously, it's a lot of money
[30940.16s -> 30943.16s]  Hey, germa got some bad news about my cat today
[30943.72s -> 30947.88s]  But your stream has been making it easier to cope just wanted to thank you for making everything a little easier
[30949.13s -> 30951.31s]  Whatever that news is
[30951.39s -> 30957.88s]  I'm hope you get through it. Thanks for the thousand bits. Thanks for sticking around
[30958.78s -> 30960.78s]  Uh, it's it's my pleasure to have you around
[30968.72s -> 30970.56s]  Sorry about the bad news
[30970.56s -> 30973.76s]  Whatever it is
[30973.76s -> 30978.91s]  Moving on to four real dough for 250
[30979.96s -> 30983.88s]  Is there a specific guide you use to get this game working? If yes, can we get a link to it?
[30985.28s -> 30989.12s]  Uh, okay. Let me go through the process here because it was weird
[30990.00s -> 30991.68s]  so
[30991.68s -> 30993.74s]  There is
[30993.74s -> 30995.50s]  This is an original cd
[30995.50s -> 30997.50s]  So it's black and white just the game
[30998.30s -> 31000.30s]  The original game no expansions or anything
[31001.26s -> 31007.23s]  And it I installed it I do I did not run it with compatibility mode. I just installed the game
[31009.95s -> 31013.71s]  Yeah, go to pc gaming wiki. That's a great place to do it. There is a fan patch
[31014.86s -> 31017.76s]  Because version the game patched up to version 1.3
[31018.86s -> 31024.24s]  I think is where the game officially ended and then some fans made a 1.4
[31025.18s -> 31030.30s]  And it fixed a bunch of the bugs and made it I think run better or run on um on newer hardware
[31030.70s -> 31035.02s]  Because I tried to run this game without the fan patch and it didn't work it crashed a desktop every single time
[31037.36s -> 31041.60s]  Yeah, bwf, uh, yeah bwf files windows 10. Yeah
[31044.12s -> 31046.20s]  I think there's at least a couple of guides on that website, too
[31046.76s -> 31049.80s]  But you you have to have that especially if you have windows 10
[31050.44s -> 31053.96s]  You have to have that 1.43 or 1.42. Whatever it is
[31055.72s -> 31057.24s]  Fan patch
[31057.24s -> 31061.16s]  And we've had a crash maybe once or twice and had a little scare about the save game
[31061.16s -> 31063.16s]  But for the most part it's been running
[31063.96s -> 31065.96s]  I would say flawlessly at this point
[31068.49s -> 31070.49s]  Uh, you also might have to get a dll, too
[31073.77s -> 31075.77s]  But cross that bridge when you need to
[31076.25s -> 31084.97s]  But that fan patch will help you. It's the only way to install black and white legit
[31088.52s -> 31096.80s]  big crash
[31096.80s -> 31098.56s]  I you know, okay
[31098.56s -> 31104.48s]  This is like this is funny to me, but also like I can't believe it. We're still arguing about oil changes right now
[31110.65s -> 31112.65s]  But I mean the others but I like
[31113.61s -> 31115.61s]  Somebody's saying it's a mess. It's a pain
[31116.25s -> 31121.77s]  I i'd rather just have somebody else do it. My time is valuable to me. You know what I mean? Like I
[31123.31s -> 31126.78s]  We're still going on that
[31126.78s -> 31128.78s]  Does luigi change his own oil?
[31131.52s -> 31143.21s]  Luigi probably can't even change his own diaper guys. Why am I so mean to a luigi?
[31143.29s -> 31145.29s]  Anybody why would I be this mean to luigi?
[31148.67s -> 31150.67s]  Jen ski flower. Thanks for the 300 bits
[31151.55s -> 31155.07s]  Hey jerma, i'm really glad you're playing black and white. It's one of my favorite childhood games
[31155.39s -> 31158.51s]  And when I bring it up everyone thinks i'm talking about pokemon black and white
[31159.15s -> 31162.44s]  I hope your doctor's appointment went well and you're feeling better from your illness
[31162.92s -> 31167.56s]  Or at least doing better than I am since i'm having an allergic reaction to my hair dye
[31168.04s -> 31170.60s]  And have sore itchy scabs all over my scalp
[31171.79s -> 31173.87s]  Holy shit, that's doesn't sound fun
[31175.74s -> 31178.54s]  And if you're not you better get some rest you toasted walnut
[31180.88s -> 31183.02s]  Yeah, i'm feeling all right
[31183.02s -> 31188.14s]  I I was coming down from my actual I had a head cold over the last few days and i'm feeling okay now
[31188.38s -> 31190.38s]  I'll probably be 100 better tomorrow
[31191.02s -> 31194.59s]  We can keep going
[31194.59s -> 31196.67s]  But thank you, uh jenski flower for the 300 bits
[31198.84s -> 31202.84s]  Mini clips. Thanks for 500 bits. What do you call a cow with no legs a ground beef?
[31207.05s -> 31211.69s]  Thank you bulbous swag again for five more dollars here. Just wanted to round up my bits for the night
[31212.65s -> 31214.81s]  But I gotta say you're a cruel and vengeful god
[31220.99s -> 31222.99s]  Uh, is it me? That's cruel
[31223.31s -> 31227.15s]  I keep thinking okay
[31227.15s -> 31229.15s]  Fuck, what did I think of this morning?
[31230.51s -> 31232.67s]  I was in bed this morning
[31233.88s -> 31237.80s]  And I started laughing just laughing really hard at something
[31239.13s -> 31240.83s]  What was it?
[31240.83s -> 31244.27s]  It was something random that I thought you guys would think was funny
[31244.91s -> 31249.71s]  I was in bed rolling around. You know when you get lost in your thoughts and you're in that half sleep
[31252.19s -> 31254.19s]  And you're not dreaming
[31254.35s -> 31260.59s]  But your imagination becomes way vivid way more interesting and way more vivid when you're in that halfway point
[31262.57s -> 31267.45s]  Something stream related happened that I remembered and I just started cracking up
[31268.73s -> 31272.08s]  Uh, what the hell was it? This is gonna happen though
[31272.72s -> 31278.08s]  I'm gonna randomly see in that half sleep the cow throwing the rocket though with those people and i'm gonna start cracking up
[31280.12s -> 31285.72s]  It's inevitable
[31285.72s -> 31287.72s]  That's so oh i'm so
[31288.12s -> 31292.12s]  I love this cow and if it wasn't the cow if it was going to be the the ape
[31292.44s -> 31297.48s]  The ape probably wouldn't have done that. I don't think so the cow like sucks. So I don't think the ape would have done it
[31298.36s -> 31302.52s]  I love this cow. We got to rescue him. Don't you understand? We have to rescue him
[31303.24s -> 31304.52s]  he's being
[31304.52s -> 31313.95s]  Captured and tortured right now. We have to get him. Thank you bulbous work tangent. Thanks for the five community subs tangent
[31315.08s -> 31319.24s]  The pc int thanks for 300 bits germa. It's not your fault, but my username
[31319.72s -> 31322.44s]  Is the point but the o is a c
[31324.46s -> 31326.46s]  Lol, the point was taken
[31327.82s -> 31329.82s]  Oh, so it's not the pc int
[31331.12s -> 31333.82s]  It's the point
[31333.82s -> 31337.98s]  I hope you have a good day missed most of the stream seems like it was both chaotic and boring at the same time
[31341.87s -> 31346.94s]  um
[31346.94s -> 31351.42s]  I mean, it's just it's a different type of game. You know, they take a while to do anything interesting
[31351.66s -> 31353.82s]  But when stuff happens it goes fucking crazy
[31354.78s -> 31364.48s]  That's another reason why I want to do this do the tutorial and like try to pay attention to a lot of things
[31365.44s -> 31368.01s]  Just to make anything fun happen in the game
[31368.01s -> 31372.97s]  You really kind of need to know how it works and I didn't want to just blow through it because I could skip the tutorial
[31372.97s -> 31374.41s]  completely
[31374.41s -> 31380.73s]  So I need to continue to learn
[31381.37s -> 31384.97s]  Level three requires you to use all the mechanics germa's been neglecting. It should be good. Yeah
[31385.69s -> 31389.16s]  We'll see the thanks them
[31390.68s -> 31395.48s]  Errorless thanks for the 250 when you're gonna do a collab a collab with uh lil naz
[31396.60s -> 31404.75s]  I don't think that's gonna happen. I i mean i'm flattered i'm flattered if if he likes
[31406.83s -> 31408.51s]  rat movie
[31408.51s -> 31411.47s]  That's where they got it from. I you know what I mean?
[31414.35s -> 31416.35s]  That's uh, it's flattering
[31417.80s -> 31419.08s]  uh
[31419.08s -> 31421.48s]  Just dm him and say you're the giant rat guy
[31422.81s -> 31424.81s]  I don't know if I want to do that
[31424.81s -> 31429.61s]  Hey, hey, i'm the giant rat guy. Hey, you you you tweeted that i'm the giant rat guy. It's me
[31430.17s -> 31432.65s]  You ret you tweeted something out with giant rat. I'm that guy
[31433.74s -> 31436.78s]  That's a little that's that kind of grasping. I don't i'm not into that
[31439.52s -> 31441.12s]  That's just cool that
[31441.12s -> 31447.87s]  He may have seen the video. That's just cool. I don't need nothing. I don't need anything else. No, that's enough for me
[31449.37s -> 31451.37s]  But you know if he did
[31451.85s -> 31453.71s]  If he was like, hey
[31453.71s -> 31457.31s]  Giant rat was really awesome. I'd be like that's me. I'm that guy
[31458.11s -> 31470.83s]  Uh, that's just cool. And that's all there is to it high tie. Thanks for the 1500 bits
[31471.93s -> 31476.73s]  $15 thanks a lot. This is my way of saying thank you. I've been watching your videos for over five years
[31477.35s -> 31481.61s]  Specifically starting with the pin cushion experiment. That was a that was a good one
[31482.57s -> 31488.41s]  You continue to be the funniest entertainer out there and I can never make up the countless hours of entertainment you've provided
[31489.37s -> 31493.96s]  Thanks man, I wish I'd been watching you for five years
[31496.57s -> 31500.65s]  Well, you you got five years from now, you'll be you'll five years from now
[31500.65s -> 31506.65s]  You'll look back and be like, oh, remember that was pretty fucking cool. Remember when the cow threw the rock at those people
[31507.53s -> 31512.65s]  your story
[31512.65s -> 31514.01s]  Begins now
[31514.01s -> 31518.17s]  But seriously high tide. Thank you
[31518.89s -> 31520.89s]  Thanks for allowing me to be able to do something like this
[31522.06s -> 31526.70s]  And wake up every day and go what do I want to try to do today that that might be fun
[31529.28s -> 31535.80s]  People like you allow me to do that. So thank you. Finally, we have a couple more we have kerbumble for 300 bits
[31536.68s -> 31542.04s]  We have for real dough for 250. I enjoyed the stream drummer. Here's to hoping this game and the sequel get a digital release
[31542.90s -> 31547.32s]  Re-release or a decent spiritual successor. That's something that I wish they already existed
[31549.29s -> 31551.05s]  If you took black and white
[31551.05s -> 31553.93s]  one and two and just remade it as just
[31554.57s -> 31556.57s]  Just remake it just black and white
[31557.05s -> 31562.73s]  Remake some of the systems take away some of the potentially more grindy frustrating systems that are in the game and put a bunch
[31562.81s -> 31565.29s]  New creatures in make the ai crazier
[31566.25s -> 31568.25s]  People would eat this up so much
[31568.73s -> 31573.61s]  But not very many people not many people know it exists and people that do know it exists
[31573.85s -> 31576.41s]  Can barely play it because it's hard to get to run
[31580.44s -> 31583.16s]  Mike it's microsoft microsoft is sitting on all this shit
[31583.70s -> 31586.36s]  Microsoft owns all these assets like what get on it
[31592.56s -> 31595.68s]  That microsoft owns all the all the lion head ip, right?
[31600.49s -> 31601.61s]  like
[31601.61s -> 31604.57s]  There's so much interesting shit that they could do with some of these lion head ips
[31609.74s -> 31611.42s]  ea owns it
[31611.42s -> 31613.82s]  I thought lion head was absorbed by
[31614.54s -> 31615.66s]  microsoft
[31615.66s -> 31618.67s]  Yeah, I thought so. It's ea. What?
[31626.30s -> 31634.11s]  Seriously
[31634.11s -> 31637.39s]  That's even worse. Yeah, that's that is that is kind of worse
[31640.32s -> 31644.00s]  I thought I always thought that it was it came with the absorption of all of lion head
[31646.03s -> 31650.57s]  Hmm. Well, oh well send it to bed then
[31651.85s -> 31653.69s]  Because that ain't coming back
[31653.69s -> 31657.05s]  Uh e cookie. Thanks for the 250 and our final bit of the night. Hey germa
[31657.05s -> 31661.93s]  I'm a veterinarian by trade and specialize in small rodents like rats mice and hamsters
[31662.73s -> 31667.76s]  All right. Let's get some info here for rats. They do actually enjoy being put in small piles with other rats
[31667.92s -> 31669.28s]  Like yeah, right
[31669.28s -> 31673.04s]  If I have a if I have a particularly anxious rat
[31673.68s -> 31680.48s]  I will place him with four or five other rats in a bowl then put that into a deep fryer you motherfucker
[31681.52s -> 31683.84s]  Right. Okay. Thanks veterinarian
[31685.53s -> 31687.69s]  Thanks the fucking fake veterinarian
[31688.49s -> 31695.79s]  That's the last bit of the night
