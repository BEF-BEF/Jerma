[0.38s -> 14.44s]  Can you fucking guys see me? Am I live? Hello? What's happening?
[14.44s -> 30.41s]  Alright, that's really weird. Uh, my stream key. Something was fucking weird with my stream key.
[30.41s -> 33.77s]  When I was doing testing, remember earlier like an hour ago when I was doing like a test to make
[33.77s -> 40.12s]  sure we could stream at the same time? I got a stream key issue there. That was fucking weird.
[40.12s -> 128.52s]  But anyways, uh, hold on a minute. Hey, let's do the- just pretend I'm not here for a second.
[128.52s -> 138.14s]  Alright, so I think- I think I'm ready. I think I'm ready to play. Should be good to go.
[138.14s -> 144.74s]  Uh, let's just make sure that you can see that. And you can. Alright, okay, we're getting there.
[144.74s -> 157.69s]  I got a little cropping issue over here with my open VR. What is it? Wait, wait, what's this
[157.69s -> 163.67s]  giant warning? If the control buttons don't work, please check the game windows. What?
[163.67s -> 176.82s]  How do I get rid of this little fucking thing on the bottom left? Oh, I got it.
[176.82s -> 198.74s]  Almost there. Looking good. Door exposed. What do I mean door exposed? Door exposed.
[198.74s -> 207.50s]  Oh, hi guys! How are you? Welcome to the stream! I think that's good. No, hold on a
[207.50s -> 219.58s]  second. So today, as you didn't know by the uh, the point I did, we're doing VR tonight.
[219.58s -> 229.48s]  Isn't that better? Yeah, well that's what we're gonna do, a test. Are you ready?
[229.48s -> 233.96s]  Here's the test, because I couldn't really tell from- before- you're gonna- I'm gonna blow
[233.96s -> 261.08s]  your eardrums. Okay, so you guys need to tell me. So- so I'm in, okay? So I had the
[261.08s -> 264.20s]  chat program thing where you go like this and see the chat, but I couldn't get it to
[264.20s -> 269.05s]  fucking work. I tried so hard, and I'm gonna get that ready for tomorrow. But for today,
[269.05s -> 278.70s]  how does it sound? Does it sound like shit? Why is it that way? Why is the game that way?
[286.25s -> 301.58s]  Why is the game that way? I'm peeking the mic. All right, what about now? Desync low
[301.58s -> 307.66s]  quality. It's- it's desynced? Oh, wait, wait, wait, come on, ready? What do you hear?
[307.66s -> 335.29s]  Do you hear my- the clap first, or do you hit a cl- the clap after? All right, hold on.
[335.29s -> 338.65s]  How's that? Is that- can you still hear me? Are we good? Is that better?
[338.65s -> 341.77s]  Mine's gonna be desynced, but I couldn't tell. Hold on, let me move this shit.
[341.77s -> 355.64s]  Hold on, sorry, but block your ears. I'm just like grabbing onto your ears.
[355.64s -> 358.92s]  So- so that's better. So this is fine? You guys ever okay with this? Let's try some
[358.92s -> 364.76s]  tests here. Are we synced? Why the fuck is the game behind me?
[364.76s -> 373.14s]  I did like the point to your monitor this way. So there's still a desync. Let me try this.
[373.14s -> 380.54s]  That's fucking weird. A lot of weird shit. Oh, god damn it. Of course there's a desync.
[381.18s -> 385.34s]  Stupid fucking- I was playing PlayStation 3 yesterday. Everything's fine now.
[390.46s -> 394.92s]  Okay, so here we go. Look, I got my controllers here. I went like that.
[395.80s -> 400.20s]  Like I pointed this way to the monitors. Should I just recalibrate and point that way?
[400.84s -> 406.39s]  So I'm just gonna recalibrate. I'm just gonna point the controller this way.
[407.03s -> 423.05s]  I'm gonna try that because- what the fuck? All right, let's do a room setup. What's happening?
[423.61s -> 429.67s]  What the hell is that on the- oh, please take off the headset and follow the- you got it.
[429.67s -> 441.11s]  Okay, hold on a second here guys. All right, this will only take a second. All right, turn
[441.11s -> 445.99s]  the controllers, place the controllers. I just- I did this like three times. Why if I point this
[445.99s -> 454.34s]  way at my screen- fucking valve. Locate your monitor. Okay, let me locate the monitor real
[454.34s -> 466.01s]  quick. Found it. Well, I know where the floor is. I sure as hell know where that is. It's right
[466.01s -> 480.65s]  here. There's the floor. Okay. Now I'm gonna measure- I'm gonna do like the- here we go.
[480.65s -> 497.53s]  I did this shit like five times already. I wanted to be like prepared for the VR streams,
[498.17s -> 502.97s]  but you never are. They expect somebody to fucking buy this? You think like grandma's
[502.97s -> 512.98s]  gonna play this game? Okay, there we are. Let's go. Your minimum play area is not big enough.
[521.61s -> 525.21s]  I just- it was- what happened in the- is it because my monitor is over here now?
[526.23s -> 531.61s]  Is that the problem? My monitor changed its positions and therefore I don't have enough
[531.61s -> 542.79s]  room to play? Fucking virtual reality. Give me a goddamn Super Nintendo any day of the week.
[543.35s -> 562.95s]  Okay. Okay, there we go. Play area has been selected. Your play area has been selected.
[564.68s -> 573.19s]  Done. Setup complete. All right, here we go. I'm ready. Can you guys hear the game? All right,
[573.19s -> 589.40s]  here we go. How do- all right, I gotta open the game again. So what the hell is over there?
[592.52s -> 599.93s]  No game, no sound. No game, no sound. There it comes. I just have to- all right. What the
[599.93s -> 603.45s]  fuck is it opening? What are you opening? What are you doing? What the fuck is that?
[603.45s -> 609.69s]  Why is that on the screen? Why is that on the screen? I'm not even in that game!
[609.69s -> 625.32s]  I'm not even in this game! Give me a goddamn Super Nintendo. I'll take Donkey Kong Country 2,
[627.03s -> 636.38s]  please, if you could. I don't know how many people are watching. I think we got it. Here
[636.38s -> 656.98s]  it comes. Did it work? I think that's it, right? Yup. So I just want to make sure- I want
[656.98s -> 661.22s]  to make sure we're really clear on this, guys. I want to make sure you're damn clear on this.
[662.26s -> 667.61s]  I pointed my- please point towards your monitor. I pointed that way.
[668.79s -> 675.80s]  I think we fixed it. Technology sucks. Let's go back to fucking books. All right, I'm going in.
[682.65s -> 688.01s]  Yeah, the original virtual world. It's called J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.
[695.61s -> 706.15s]  Are we good? I can't even drink my coffee. All right, I'm so excited for this. I really am.
[706.15s -> 711.35s]  Where's my predator connection here? Which one's right and which one's left? Can I see
[711.35s -> 714.87s]  that through here? I can't. Why would I be able to see that? Which is the left one,
[714.87s -> 724.47s]  which is the right one? I can't- where the- okay, the best part about the Steam VR shit,
[725.19s -> 735.18s]  and I- this is so loud. I get up- how do I adjust this? I'm only going with one. I don't
[735.18s -> 750.33s]  give a fuck. Until somebody figures that- there's got to be like a drink can thing that comes
[750.33s -> 763.34s]  down. How are you supposed to hydrate? That's on the- uh, that's mono sound in VR.
[765.26s -> 768.86s]  I can't do it, man. I'll throw up. All right, I'm getting my zone here.
[769.66s -> 775.32s]  I've made it to the zone, the play area, and I'm ready to fucking go nuts. I'm gonna turn
[775.32s -> 783.05s]  the game down a little. All right, I'm getting in the zone. I gotta put these down first so
[783.05s -> 787.77s]  I can get as comfortable- I don't like this fucking giant cable. How much is the wireless
[787.77s -> 799.48s]  thing? 300 bucks? Fuck me, I have like a giant rat tail. I have a giant rat tail
[799.48s -> 811.67s]  that's weighing me down. I've never even put it on. I wanted it to be blind. I adjusted.
[812.31s -> 818.28s]  I put the head on, but I didn't put like the rat tail on. All right, guys, I'm fucking ready
[818.28s -> 822.84s]  to go. Where are my hands? I'm supposed to be able to see my hands in VR. Where are they?
[823.88s -> 845.38s]  All right, let's do it! Something happened in here that I'm not, uh, gonna necessarily
[845.38s -> 862.39s]  aware. Okay, I think- okay, I got it. I got it. My hands- why? You need like fucking
[862.39s -> 867.43s]  four people- you gotta hire like three people to help you get into a game. All right,
[867.43s -> 875.54s]  I'm ready. It's nice and snug. It looks good. No, what the fuck are you doing? I don't- no,
[875.54s -> 888.60s]  don't go home! Get- what button did I just press? What, is there a button? No, don't turn the
[888.60s -> 904.47s]  system off! Okay, okay, guys, welcome to my VR attempt here to try VR for the first time.
[905.43s -> 910.07s]  At least in the Steam version of VR, which I've heard is quite fun and quite interesting.
[910.07s -> 914.71s]  We're gonna play this game called Blade and Sorcery. Came out, um, probably a couple years
[914.71s -> 917.51s]  ago, but I never had a chance to play it. Let's go ahead and create our character.
[919.43s -> 924.54s]  It's like got this- what? Wait, why is it giving me like a little cube indicator?
[925.26s -> 933.58s]  Get out of here! I know that I can't go that far. Why are you boxing me in? Stop it!
[936.49s -> 952.09s]  All right, we got, uh, hair. Uh, oh, you can select it. Let's go Mohawk. A beard. What
[952.17s -> 955.53s]  about- what about for a beard? What do you guys think? Oh, that's right, I couldn't get that to
[955.53s -> 971.94s]  work. Eye color. Uh, let's just go with like here. That's fine. Uh, I- is this game good?
[972.98s -> 976.10s]  Like, this is a highly requested game. I don't- I don't care what he looks like. Face.
[976.98s -> 980.50s]  Oh god, you're gonna do this to me right now. Why would you give me a character creator?
[981.94s -> 988.10s]  An elaborate character creator? That's so cool. Okay, eye size, eye rotation,
[988.90s -> 1026.17s]  a mouth size. Uh, is this doing anything? Okay, I gave him a Mickey Mouse nose.
[1038.26s -> 1048.81s]  Somebody just like punched into his face. All right, you know what? Let's go with uh,
[1048.81s -> 1061.54s]  glutes. Oh, the glutens. I just heard my computer make a loud click sound. I don't
[1061.54s -> 1066.02s]  know if that's good or not. Am I still alive? Did my computer, did my motherboard just like
[1066.02s -> 1072.82s]  fry? Did I just fry my motherboard? I don't know. I don't know because I can't see. Who said that?
[1082.20s -> 1087.80s]  He's got like- he's got skin colored football pads on. This is like a joke. He went to the
[1087.80s -> 1104.65s]  party store and got this put on. Oh wait, hold on. That's too tall. You gotta be small
[1104.65s -> 1114.50s]  than that. Feet size. All right, that's good. I'm ready. All right, select this character.
[1115.14s -> 1122.47s]  I've got- is this play area too small? Am I gonna get yelled at for this every time?
[1123.27s -> 1126.31s]  Can you guys see these bars? Can you see these bars?
[1127.19s -> 1136.71s]  I might have to like sit down in a chair and just change it. I thought I told me I had
[1136.71s -> 1146.98s]  enough room. Select. Calibrate. Please stand up, look straight, and click calibrate to set.
[1160.65s -> 1165.85s]  It just made him- it just made him fucking this up. Okay, let's play the game. I can't
[1165.85s -> 1180.70s]  wait. Oh my god. What the fuck? Look at you. That's never- I've never experienced something
[1180.70s -> 1200.73s]  that fucking ridiculous before in my life. Like in my whole life. That's fucking so funny. Okay,
[1200.73s -> 1206.22s]  so I move around like- how do I move around? Did you know- I can't read any of that. I have
[1206.22s -> 1213.50s]  no idea what the fuck that says. Did you know you can sheath up to four objects? Do I
[1213.50s -> 1228.76s]  have to walk there? Okay, this is actually important because I will walk into a fucking wall.
[1228.76s -> 1245.27s]  I will actually hurt myself, so it's good that I did this here. How do I move? I don't- how do
[1245.27s -> 1269.42s]  I move? Oh look- okay, that's fucking weird. I'm sorry. Oh, you can jump? I don't like
[1269.42s -> 1278.23s]  doing that. It's too fast. How do I go slower? Okay, I'm starting to figure it out. Let's
[1278.23s -> 1284.18s]  see. You can sheath up to four objects and weapons on you. You can sheath up to four
[1284.18s -> 1291.30s]  objects and weapons on you by dropping them over your left or right shoulder. What? What?
[1292.47s -> 1301.29s]  So you can sheath up to four weapons by dropping them over your shoulder or on each side of your
[1301.29s -> 1313.62s]  hips. How close am I to this wall? Okay, you can practice this by doing it by looking at
[1313.62s -> 1317.22s]  yourself in the mirror in the home. Be aware that some objects are restricted to hips or
[1317.22s -> 1328.78s]  back only. How do I like turn around again? Okay, there it is. All right, that kind of makes
[1328.78s -> 1334.86s]  me want to die doing that though too often. All right, cool. So I practice with a sword.
[1335.58s -> 1345.35s]  How do I grab it? How do I get the sword? Sword, yeah. I want to grab it with like
[1345.35s -> 1373.78s]  what- which button? Okay. Can I hold it with two hands? Come on, use my force powers.
[1377.51s -> 1409.00s]  Ah, this is the coolest thing I've ever done in my life. I'm gonna hit the fucking wall.
[1409.88s -> 1429.40s]  I'm gonna get like a good stance here. I'm having more fun just doing this than anything
[1429.40s -> 1478.87s]  else. All right, come to me. How do I get it to pull over here? It's not gonna work.
[1478.87s -> 1497.03s]  All right, get it. Where'd it go? All right, how do I play? Let's go. So I can check it
[1497.03s -> 1501.83s]  right. It's right. It's the right one. So it's this one. There it is. Okay, cool.
[1504.58s -> 1507.62s]  I love this so much. I don't know what to do. Let's go over here. Let's take a look at
[1507.78s -> 1524.76s]  the books. What's that? What's that monster? There's a monster back here. Oh, it's okay.
[1524.76s -> 1555.19s]  It's a pottery thing. What the fuck is this? Oh, shit. I have to try to put it back in.
[1559.78s -> 1575.08s]  Get in there. This one. What the fuck? I'm pressing it, aren't I? It's right. It's right.
[1575.88s -> 1586.68s]  Sit on there. Come here. In. To the holster. Okay. My goodness. Is there a mission?
[1606.38s -> 1614.39s]  All right. Where am I in my room? Where am I? I'm looking to hit something.
[1614.39s -> 1639.86s]  Okay, that's not a real table. What's this one do? The market. Yeah, let's go. Let's
[1639.86s -> 1650.52s]  go to the market. Unknown location. Okay. What's that one? The arena. Wait, there's
[1650.52s -> 1663.02s]  a book over there. No one's ever gonna be able to do this. Choose destination on the
[1663.02s -> 1673.26s]  map to travel. Isn't that what I just did? The ruins. Oh, okay. These ruins have been
[1673.26s -> 1678.78s]  known to protect a mysterious cult practicing dark magic and human sacrifice. Make them pay
[1678.78s -> 1697.86s]  for their crimes. Am I facing the right way? I'm so disoriented. I'm ready. I have to,
[1697.86s -> 1717.19s]  like, move, otherwise it feels weird standing doing this. Is it gonna kill me if I let it
[1717.19s -> 1724.94s]  go? No, that's fine. All right, well, we don't need that right now. This is probably
[1724.94s -> 1729.83s]  a puzzle that I'm gonna have to do later. Can I just, like, can I just hit shit?
[1730.47s -> 1744.15s]  What's the distance? Right, like, here. This is the most fun thing I've ever done. I'm serious.
[1744.95s -> 1749.83s]  I'm serious. This is the funnest thing I've ever done in my whole life. I've been to Disney
[1749.83s -> 1759.96s]  World. I've rode roller coasters before. I've had teeth pulled. Uh, very easy. Wave one.
[1759.96s -> 1778.17s]  Uh, what's it gonna do? What? Here, put this away for a second. Okay. Oh, all right,
[1778.17s -> 1782.81s]  we got very easy. I just, I needed to know how to play the game. Start it. Fight in
[1782.81s -> 1834.78s]  progress. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, I just hit my hand. Gotta make sure he's dead.
[1834.78s -> 1878.20s]  I'm gonna two-hand this. Ow! I went the wrong way. Oh, I dropped it! I blocked it.
[1878.20s -> 1882.42s]  Which way is he coming? Which way is he gonna go, huh? Which way is he gonna go?
[1882.42s -> 1918.07s]  Oh! What do you got? Give me a weapon. What do you got? What is this, stick?
[1919.19s -> 1949.77s]  Come with me, like, always. That works. Holy shit, why am I flying?
[1949.77s -> 1975.56s]  We got another one? Two more? Get in the low center of gravity. This fucking room
[1975.56s -> 1998.82s]  scale. My earbuds fell out. How do I pause the game? How do I pause VR? I don't have
[1998.82s -> 2045.59s]  any sound. Cut him in half! Ow! I'm gonna lie on my fucking, like,
[2045.59s -> 2057.61s]  resume here. I'm gonna lie on my SATs. That was fun. Where the fuck am I?
[2057.61s -> 2061.21s]  Uh, I'm gonna redo the room scale calibration and, like, pretend the room is bigger.
[2061.21s -> 2083.64s]  Need some coffee after that one. I put on the straps. Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[2083.64s -> 2088.26s]  I forgot I gotta put the straps on. All right, is the room scale thing annoying,
[2088.26s -> 2091.62s]  or is it, is that, okay, is that, like, not irritating to look at?
[2091.62s -> 2095.03s]  Because, like, I could just fake it. I'm not gonna hit the fucking wall.
[2095.03s -> 2105.13s]  All right, that's on. It's fine, it's fine. Okay. All right, just making sure it's not,
[2105.13s -> 2112.22s]  like, annoying to see. Move your arms in a walking motion to move instead.
[2113.10s -> 2120.39s]  Really? You can make it feel less intrusive in the settings, really.
[2124.46s -> 2126.94s]  Just like the Steam, like, VR settings? Hold on, let me just, like, see.
[2127.66s -> 2133.03s]  It's, like, crushing my eye. So, let me see here. I got the Steam VR right here.
[2133.59s -> 2145.40s]  Settings. Put this up. Uh, night mode, locked mode, DND,
[2149.66s -> 2154.62s]  suppress warnings and alerts when Steam's VR status is minimized. It's in the VR setting.
[2154.62s -> 2159.62s]  Yeah, I'm in the VR settings right now. That was so much fucking fun.
[2160.34s -> 2172.07s]  No, with your headset on. It's the settings while in VR. Oh, okay.
[2172.87s -> 2179.70s]  So, do I have to, like, go, like, is there a way I can get to, like, the Steam, like,
[2179.70s -> 2189.29s]  the VR menu? It's the bottom button. Oh, it is. So, it's this button on the side of the headset.
[2189.29s -> 2196.71s]  It's the thing that I pressed before. Whoa. I got to recalibrate. Recalibrate.
[2205.69s -> 2214.07s]  And then it's the settings in here. What the fuck is this button?
[2214.07s -> 2217.11s]  I pressed it accidentally before, and now I can't, like, find the damn thing.
[2217.91s -> 2233.67s]  There it is. Okay. So, settings, right? Stream. Okay. Night mode. Do not disturb.
[2234.47s -> 2242.14s]  It's the chaperone. Chaperone bounds. Opacity. Bring it down. Okay, that's better.
[2243.78s -> 2252.44s]  All right, that's cool. Intermediate. What's that mean? All right. Squares. Advanced.
[2254.58s -> 2260.58s]  Developer. Developer. Oh, okay. So, that, that did make some go away completely. I don't know
[2260.58s -> 2263.30s]  if I want to do that because that's, like, actually probably dangerous. I'm going to get
[2263.30s -> 2267.14s]  hurt. But maybe I don't give a fuck. We'll see. We'll see how annoying it is.
[2271.74s -> 2277.43s]  All right. Let's keep going. I'm going to put both headphones in so he can't hear us. You know
[2277.43s -> 2287.62s]  what I mean? He can't hear us. I'm so sweaty already. Yeah, that's much better. All right.
[2287.62s -> 2294.63s]  So, I need to, like, how do I, like, recalibrate this? This is not right. At all.
[2316.90s -> 2325.75s]  I might have to back to app. What did I do fucking wrong?
[2328.07s -> 2337.83s]  Click window on desktop. Holy fuck. All right. We're good. All right. Let's get back in one more
[2337.83s -> 2340.63s]  sip of coffee and we're going to do the next, we're going to do a harder wave, I think.
[2349.64s -> 2359.43s]  Let me get my fucking headphones back in. I'm so glad somebody actually made this game.
[2362.52s -> 2373.24s]  No, stop doing that. Respell. Respell. Respell. Respell. Respell.
[2374.49s -> 2382.87s]  I don't know what spell I did. Okay. Let's get this back on. All right. Let's go. Respell.
[2385.62s -> 2393.66s]  Okay. There's my sword, right? All right. Let's get this foot back where I wanted it.
[2395.19s -> 2398.58s]  Turn around here. They had some cool weapons though. Let me see what they had.
[2399.14s -> 2418.66s]  Some kind of stick. Seems pretty good. I don't know if it's that good though.
[2419.30s -> 2431.16s]  Doesn't even break any bones. This sucks. Give me my, no, here we go. Here's a new weapon,
[2431.16s -> 2437.43s]  right? Is this the same sword that I had before or is this different?
[2438.07s -> 2455.10s]  Like, hold on a minute here, fellas. All right. Who wants some pork? I'm ready for the next wave.
[2455.10s -> 2466.95s]  Fight ended. Okay. Return. Where's like the food game where you can like,
[2466.95s -> 2471.16s]  I just want to get like, I don't care about, is there a game with an onion?
[2472.23s -> 2475.59s]  Is there an onion in this game or in any VR game where I get an onion and just be like,
[2476.90s -> 2486.41s]  and the fuck, I'll just like slide it into the pot. All right. We'll do wave two.
[2486.97s -> 2500.02s]  There you go. This guy's got, jump over the rock. That would have been cool.
[2500.66s -> 2514.36s]  Just wait till he swims and then come in with a double. Just treat him like an onion.
[2515.00s -> 2531.66s]  I gotta get, what's on me? What the, why did I become the rock? Hello? What?
[2536.79s -> 2552.38s]  Give me that sword back. Where the fuck is hitting me?
[2566.76s -> 2574.26s]  You want to get the fucking chef? Eat this, you fucking celery bitch.
[2574.26s -> 2605.78s]  I'm wild. I'm like a caged fucking beast. I got both of you. Oh, would that hurt your hand? I'm sorry, ma'am.
[2622.74s -> 2631.59s]  Wait, how do I do anything? Can I grab? What? Oh my God. This is fucking a blast.
[2632.15s -> 2641.98s]  I'm losing my mind. I don't even, I don't even have my twitch dashboard on.
[2644.26s -> 2647.22s]  Sweat check. It's always going to get bad here in about like 20 minutes.
[2648.97s -> 2660.14s]  You can throw weapons? How do I throw a weapon? Hold trigger while using telekinesis. Okay.
[2666.07s -> 2671.85s]  Relevant controller. Drink water. Don't drink coffee. I got plenty of fucking hydration
[2671.85s -> 2681.26s]  room back off. How do I have like hair in my mouth? No, stop it. All right, steam. I'm
[2681.26s -> 2684.86s]  going to give you a fucking design choice here that I would change if I were you.
[2686.28s -> 2691.64s]  Don't have the button be here. Have the button be like up here somewhere. Like up here.
[2691.64s -> 2699.16s]  Because like everybody like puts it on like this. Or at least I do. So change it for me.
[2699.16s -> 2707.45s]  Okay, let's keep going. That was fucking I love this game. So let me get this straight.
[2708.09s -> 2726.54s]  Can I like throw a weapon if I like let go of this? That didn't really work. So but like this
[2730.06s -> 2736.38s]  with the force power, just kind of when I hit trigger, it kind of comes back to me.
[2740.79s -> 2745.77s]  So if I hold trigger and then do it, hold trigger and like I'm holding them both at the
[2745.77s -> 2756.30s]  same time. That was fucking cool. Hold and release when you throw it. No, that's what
[2756.30s -> 2768.30s]  I was doing. So I was holding the trigger down and then letting go. Not the trigger.
[2768.30s -> 2776.42s]  It's like this grip button. That's how you pull it up, right? Now I do have like spells
[2776.42s -> 2784.01s]  too. I gotta hold on. Let me do some like fucking fun tinkering here. So walk over here.
[2784.81s -> 2791.13s]  I got it forced right now. So if I hold the grip button down, there we go. Okay. So it's
[2791.13s -> 2796.01s]  the grip button. It's not the trigger button. Cool. Let me just play around. I got spells too,
[2796.01s -> 2807.03s]  apparently. So how do I do a spell? Okay, holding that jumps. This is walk. What is spells?
[2808.62s -> 2815.91s]  That's the other grip. I had it up there before, didn't I? Maybe it's like the trigger and grip.
[2817.67s -> 2828.33s]  Hmm. I didn't know that existed. What about down? Does down do anything on the,
[2829.21s -> 2837.98s]  okay, doesn't hurt me. Just wanted to make sure. Let's get that wave going again.
[2838.94s -> 2846.18s]  Oh, is it a spear? Hold on. I gotta, oh, come on. Let me, of course I can use the spear. Put this
[2846.18s -> 2860.06s]  back. And it's a spear and a shield. Thank you very much. Oh, this is, okay, now this is what,
[2860.06s -> 2866.18s]  this is fucking awesome. I can just be a fucking turtle dickhead and just be like this.
[2867.06s -> 2871.30s]  You know what I mean? I could be like the, what's the, what's the famous group of actors
[2871.30s -> 2881.59s]  that like took on the, took on the, the Persian, the Spartans. All right, I'm gonna do, I want
[2881.59s -> 2892.07s]  to do Spartan. Let's start it. I'm just gonna, I'm gonna, this is gonna be great.
[2896.12s -> 2904.74s]  Jesus. Use touch pad or thumb pad to stick, to scroll up or down. Use, select a wave again.
[2906.84s -> 2917.86s]  Okay, let's go. And let them know that 300 Spartans.
[2921.82s -> 2936.54s]  That's right. That's what you do. Remember they make the big wall right in his neck.
[2943.99s -> 2981.40s]  Get out of my town. They could give me like fucking 50 people,
[2981.40s -> 3028.14s]  doesn't even matter. And it's starting to hurt my back. Get out of here. Get off of me.
[3028.14s -> 3049.13s]  Oh, you want to play that way? Come on. Come on. Damn it. Oh, sorry. That was
[3049.13s -> 3084.34s]  dishonorable. I think I got him. What's going on? All right, let's go. I like this setup. Wave three
[3084.34s -> 3107.98s]  on very easy. Begin. All right, guy up top. My hands are covered in water. Oh, you get the same
[3107.98s -> 3126.09s]  strategy, but you didn't protect your legs. You didn't think I was gonna saw them. She's not
[3126.09s -> 3155.08s]  dead. Told you. Told you. Sorry, I'm being like silent. I have to. What the hell? How did
[3155.08s -> 3183.74s]  you get behind me? Oh, you got my eye like a movie. Oops. Something's in my eye. How?
[3184.22s -> 3192.89s]  Did like a piece of glass go in my eye? I just gotta get close enough to do like the sweep.
[3196.26s -> 3207.16s]  Now die. Oh, who's hitting me? I don't know. I don't know who is just hitting me.
[3208.68s -> 3243.02s]  How do I do the health potion? Oh shit. I need a different weapon. Where's my dagger?
[3243.02s -> 3261.67s]  Where's my dagger? I can fucking do that to me now, are you? Never fuck with a guy with
[3261.67s -> 3292.58s]  a spear. Just like Captain America. Let me get this straight. So can I like, I want to hold
[3292.58s -> 3304.23s]  this from a different angle. I'm letting it go. Holy shit. I got to do that to somebody.
[3304.23s -> 3327.61s]  This is like, oh, this is going right through somebody's head. This is definitely, oh,
[3327.61s -> 3332.31s]  this is so worth it. If you haven't played VR and you don't, and you figure about getting
[3332.31s -> 3339.10s]  a vibe, this game is $20, I think. Holy shit. All right. I need to get some like
[3339.10s -> 3347.50s]  backup weapons. I need to figure out how to do spells. All right. Can you come up for a second?
[3348.14s -> 3359.54s]  How much is the vibe? It's $4.99. And there are better games for free. I'm just getting a taste.
[3360.10s -> 3369.72s]  You know, I'm just getting a sample. Four dollars and 99 cents and all.
[3370.36s -> 3379.19s]  So I click in the touchpad. I was clicking the touchpad on the right or the left.
[3385.27s -> 3391.94s]  The telekinesis is going too fast. Is there like a menu I can look at?
[3397.53s -> 3403.34s]  You can grab people. Just pause and go to help. Yeah, I'll just look at it. No.
[3404.06s -> 3412.02s]  Let's see what we got here. I mean, is there? Oh, God. It's so hard to get back in once you're
[3412.02s -> 3419.61s]  out. I'm going to look like a fucking psycho, but am I going to move my hair? Holy. Let's take
[3419.61s -> 3431.24s]  a look. I just broke out of a coffin. You know what I mean? I'm not supposed to be
[3431.24s -> 3437.64s]  alive right now. I just broke out of a, they buried me like two weeks ago and I got out.
[3437.64s -> 3443.66s]  I wasn't supposed to be in there. I was still alive. Oh, there's like already like
[3443.66s -> 3451.14s]  grease on this thing. Fuck me. I can't hold it. Don't look my shirt up. I've already got like
[3451.14s -> 3465.54s]  face grease on here. I should have just got like a, like a buzz cut. Oh, I'm going to be
[3465.54s -> 3474.10s]  losing hair in front of this head. You bet you I will. All right. Let me try to get back in
[3474.10s -> 3488.01s]  here. Is there like a, like a wet wipe I can get for the vibe? There's got to be like
[3488.33s -> 3500.76s]  specific wet wipes, right? Somebody's going to make them. All right. Something's not right
[3500.76s -> 3517.26s]  here. It's going to go back around. All right. That's good. Okay. All right. Let's go take a
[3517.26s -> 3527.26s]  look at some stuff here. Back it up. So on this table, there's a health potion here.
[3527.90s -> 3571.83s]  That was delicious. Wait, I'm going dinner, man. Let's go. I'm going to do another one.
[3571.83s -> 3577.08s]  I'm just like drunk shit face guy at the bar. All right. Now we're going to go to
[3578.39s -> 3586.12s]  wave three is this one. So let's do this medium. Let's do, let's do like wave.
[3586.92s -> 3597.18s]  Let's just do wave three. Let's just try it. Wave two. All right. Let's see if I
[3597.18s -> 3604.74s]  can't fucking do something cool here. Didn't somebody say if I move my hands, I walk.
[3604.74s -> 3644.65s]  Oh, come on. What was I doing? I was grabbing him by the shoulder.
[3654.30s -> 3667.37s]  I just like did something there. It looks like when my hands were grasped.
[3668.50s -> 3674.02s]  Okay. So when you crass, okay, I got it. Lightning. So they went, okay.
[3674.02s -> 3688.06s]  So that's fucking loud. So I have lightning on my hand right now.
[3689.58s -> 3692.78s]  Is that, is that so loud that you can't even fucking hear it might be
[3695.70s -> 3720.23s]  I'm going to have to lower the fucking volume. Okay. I need a team of actors to help me.
[3720.95s -> 3732.70s]  I must just fucking tripped. All right. Let's try the wiping. So it's
[3733.66s -> 3737.66s]  grab, let go. So I only have, I have no spell here. So I have this one selected.
[3740.92s -> 3742.20s]  So let's just try it.
[3750.92s -> 3778.28s]  Give me that weapon. Oh my God. That's too much for me to handle.
[3796.55s -> 3808.95s]  Come on. Murderer. I got to do Diablo two style necromancer.
[3838.46s -> 3895.88s]  Oh my God. That was horrible. Don't let him do it. Do it. It's life or death. Which one?
[3895.88s -> 3927.03s]  Which one am I going? Give me the potion. No, don't give him the potion. I'm like handing it to them.
[3927.03s -> 3956.12s]  You idiot. You fucked it all up. No, that was pretty dramatic. I know. Grab. Yeah. I got to
[3956.12s -> 3961.93s]  get used to the controllers because it's kind of hard to. So for instance, when you like
[3961.93s -> 3966.49s]  grab, like when I press these buttons here, it's like, and you kind of have to tilt your
[3966.49s -> 3970.76s]  wrist a little because I can't really do it with my pinky. It's like, it's hard to,
[3970.76s -> 3980.06s]  I got to get used to the Vive controller. So I'm going to put, I'm going to, I'm going to
[3980.06s -> 3992.54s]  un-stop that potion. My back is like fucked up now. I've had like back problems for a while
[3992.54s -> 3995.74s]  and I have no idea what the fuck is wrong with me. All right. You stick in there.
[4000.23s -> 4008.44s]  You just stay un-stopped from my drink later. Let's get this out of my person here. Okay.
[4008.44s -> 4020.52s]  I got two daggers. Oh, let's get, okay. Let's try that again. Yeah. This time I'm going
[4020.52s -> 4033.72s]  to try to just work with this here. So bingo. That's so fucking awesome. I need to like
[4033.72s -> 4041.16s]  utilize, I got to start this and get up here. Is there, somebody has a bow. I have to crush
[4041.16s -> 4057.21s]  everybody's head with a brick. Let me just take a look. The axe. I like that. I don't
[4057.21s -> 4060.57s]  think I, I don't think I picked it up. All right. I like this one. This one's pretty
[4060.57s -> 4076.14s]  fucked up. Cool. All right. I guess that, okay. Yeah. Let's replace this. Okay. Just
[4076.14s -> 4088.62s]  make sure it works. Okay. Any more items that I need to be made aware of? Let's take a look
[4088.62s -> 4101.72s]  up top. That's so interesting. Cool. Uh, that, that over there, it looks like it could be
[4101.72s -> 4106.44s]  used. What are these bad, these oil barrels? Oh, fuck this. Just keep it here. I'm going
[4106.44s -> 4110.28s]  to be throwing these at people. Oh my God. This is perfect. Why wouldn't I come up here
[4110.28s -> 4119.93s]  before? Is it fall damage? All right. I'm going to go for like the throw shit if people
[4119.93s -> 4126.46s]  take me. I'm going to bring a potion with me up there. This one. Don't steal that.
[4128.01s -> 4136.18s]  What the hell? Why? Who's hitting me? Why? Who are you here? What? Ah, okay. Wave
[4136.26s -> 4159.54s]  three. Wait. Three stars. All right. Go. Get ready. All right. Get out of my way. What the
[4179.80s -> 4193.64s]  Is it my blood? That person. Get back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back it up.
[4193.64s -> 4251.43s]  Back it up. Give me that bow. Come here. Grab. No. What? Really? Really? There it is.
[4251.43s -> 4258.42s]  I got it. I'm taking people out. I'm fucking going to be like the Star Wars kid. Just you
[4258.42s -> 4294.33s]  wait and see. Fuck potions. We don't even need them. Stop letting go of it.
[4310.39s -> 4320.63s]  Come here. Get over here. Get the fuck over here then. Get over here then. What? What item
[4320.63s -> 4325.82s]  is this? Get off. Close the book. I'm creating a book in the middle of a fight.
[4337.94s -> 4368.50s]  How could we get that on the right track? No, it's spilling. What is it? Electricity.
[4370.39s -> 4390.36s]  I was like, am I standing in a puddle? Get off my sword. Damn it. This is fucking so much fun.
[4393.38s -> 4414.18s]  I thought, I was like, what am I standing in electricity? Absolute psycho. What? I'm fighting
[4414.18s -> 4421.30s]  for my life. I'm fighting for my life here. All right. I had a better tactic when I had this
[4421.30s -> 4430.34s]  shield and the spear. I'm actually, we're going to go easy. Like really, really easy
[4431.80s -> 4438.54s]  because God, I haven't even like grabbed the tip of the iceberg. Have I? This, this is fucking,
[4438.54s -> 4444.70s]  this is so much fun. What a broken record I am tonight about that. But my God, this is so much
[4444.70s -> 4452.46s]  different than the PSVR. It's like unbelievable. Has my stomach look fat? I mean, like not like
[4452.46s -> 4458.95s]  in the game, but me, it probably does. I want to try. I want to try just simply.
[4459.75s -> 4465.48s]  So I want to just grab this person. I'm just going to try to learn it.
[4467.53s -> 4479.03s]  So we got, okay, you're here. Can I like grab? So can I, okay, hold? Is it, okay, can you hold
[4479.03s -> 4485.21s]  this button? Do I actually have to hold it though? Yeah, you do. I gotta hold down the grip
[4485.93s -> 4536.06s]  and then, so you can do that. I can't, how do I do this? What? This is too, like what?
[4536.86s -> 4541.58s]  This is not how, this is not all right. It's not all right to like, let kids do this.
[4542.38s -> 4570.74s]  All right, I got it. You got to hold the grips down.
[4572.98s -> 4579.24s]  That was daunting. Look who I have. I have one of your comrades. All right, let's try that
[4579.24s -> 4587.24s]  again. I almost just fell backwards. Not because I'm like winded, but because I almost just fell
[4587.24s -> 4593.13s]  over because I'm moving around too much. All right, let's go back to my, my bread and butter.
[4594.38s -> 4628.12s]  I have to, really, the fucking objects just hurt. Ow, my face. Okay, that one's good. Okay,
[4628.12s -> 4644.84s]  that one's good. Wait a minute, can you? Can you? Can you? Really? I can't like drink that out of
[4644.84s -> 4676.95s]  the mug. Oh, that feels like, just that alone. Put that away. What's in here? I gotta hit
[4676.95s -> 4693.78s]  somebody in the fucking heaven chair. Like that's, yeah, I mean, where is it? I can't see it.
[4695.45s -> 4731.96s]  It's under the table. Okay, with me. Who will it be? Oh, hello, man.
[4743.64s -> 4752.62s]  Damn it. What? Did I catch the arrow? I think I just caught the arrow in the air.
[4762.36s -> 4765.48s]  It's too much fun to just experiment. All right, I'm going, I'm going for the real deal
[4766.92s -> 4771.16s]  I caught the fucking arrow out of the air. All right, give me my, give me my shit.
[4775.03s -> 4786.90s]  There it is. Let's do it. This is what I had the most success
[4787.70s -> 4794.50s]  with my setup with the protection and complete offense. My always on offense.
[4795.46s -> 4830.79s]  Let's go. They like, okay. Get out of here. Where the fuck did you come from? What?
[4831.75s -> 4894.47s]  You picked a bad place to spawn. Shoot it. Oh, I got it. Come on.
[4909.05s -> 4937.74s]  Pick up the dagger. Going up top. I'm like, I'm getting close to the wall. I gotta be careful.
[4963.26s -> 4998.12s]  I need that bow. Give me that bow. Come here. Come here. Does nobody have anything? What?
[4998.52s -> 5018.94s]  I'm stuck. I got, I'm wrapped up. I'm stuck. It's actually wrapped around my whole leg.
[5079.27s -> 5086.55s]  He put a target up for me and I hit it with extreme precision. All right. I gotta,
[5086.55s -> 5090.23s]  I gotta hold on a second here. This is on my leg. I can't, I don't know if I can show you
[5090.23s -> 5095.14s]  this. Can you guys see this? No, you can't. It's wrapped around. It's like a snake around
[5095.14s -> 5100.39s]  my leg. How the fuck am I going to get out of here? I have to just turn this way.
[5102.14s -> 5115.62s]  Whoa. Is it helping? Okay. I think that's better. That's good. Let's get it out of the way now.
[5115.62s -> 5121.43s]  The bow and arrow is fucking fun. Let me just come out for a minute.
[5126.82s -> 5137.29s]  Push the menu button for slo-mo. There's a slow motion button. Nice shirt. It's coming
[5137.29s -> 5147.70s]  through the shirt. Okay. So let me tell you a few things, right? A couple of,
[5147.70s -> 5151.77s]  a couple of important things. You know when like they have the VR set up
[5153.40s -> 5156.52s]  at the convention and they're like, Hey man, you want to check out the VR?
[5157.50s -> 5163.83s]  It's only gonna take like 20 minutes. Like, yeah, yeah, sure. No, that's why I always decline
[5163.83s -> 5169.59s]  because I end up like this and I have to go home. I gotta go back to the hotel after like being
[5169.59s -> 5185.91s]  in there for like 40 minutes. Check the face. All right. Hold on. Let me go, let me go grab
[5185.91s -> 5191.61s]  like some water. I've been in here for an hour and a half. Holy fuck. All right. Let's
[5191.61s -> 5202.34s]  check. I'm going to do like one or two more of these and we'll go on to the next thing.
[5203.75s -> 5211.82s]  What is on my face? You look like a homeless guy. I need to go look in the mirror and see how
[5211.82s -> 5228.36s]  fucking bad this looks. All right. Give me a sec. What is on my, what is on my face?
[5239.80s -> 5252.26s]  Why is it coming off on me? Is this poisonous? This is, this is from the fucking what?
[5252.26s -> 5262.86s]  Do I have an acid sweat? Oh my God. This is from the foam here. It's from the foam
[5262.86s -> 5286.28s]  in the visor. What? Are you fucking serious? Okay. Well, I look fucked up. I look like,
[5286.28s -> 5292.84s]  I look like the forward in a hockey game. I'm just like, oh yeah, let me take the break.
[5292.84s -> 5298.23s]  I just got thrown out of the hockey game for fighting. I just beat the shit. We just got the
[5298.23s -> 5300.79s]  shit kicked out of each other. Me and whoever else it was that was in the hockey game.
[5302.39s -> 5305.35s]  Oh my God. All right. Give me a second. I gotta like fucking clean my face up and
[5305.35s -> 5544.12s]  figure out why the fuck that's happening. All right. I'll be right back. All right.
[5545.00s -> 5559.64s]  It smells like Pop-Tarts in here. I don't know why. What is going on? Okay. I need to figure out
[5559.64s -> 5571.30s]  why the fuck this is happening. So I've wiped it off, but look, right? So I got a paper
[5571.30s -> 5587.56s]  towel here. Clean paper towel. It's like I'm doing a magic trick. What the fuck is,
[5587.56s -> 5601.56s]  why is it doing this? Is it just, is it, is that because it's a brand new or I mean like
[5601.56s -> 5611.29s]  that is very clearly like a bunch of shit coming off. I mean, I'm sweating in there,
[5611.29s -> 5620.95s]  like not like crazy. I mean, like maybe I am. Did I get like a defective model?
[5621.51s -> 5625.62s]  Of course. I always get the fucking like defective one. That's weird.
[5630.31s -> 5643.11s]  Did I do something wrong? That happened with mine too. Oh, okay. Well, okay. I've said,
[5644.54s -> 5647.90s]  there's like a, I swear to God, there was like another piece. It's going to keep
[5647.90s -> 5656.60s]  doing that to me. Did you put on the gamer socks? Get it. Hold on a minute.
[5657.24s -> 5660.86s]  How hard is this going to be like to put on? I think I already have one.
[5661.42s -> 5665.98s]  I think it comes with like another like thing to put on. But isn't this just,
[5665.98s -> 5668.70s]  isn't this just like a replacement? Hold on. Is this, do I need to put this on?
[5681.48s -> 5688.23s]  No, no. This is if you have, this is, this is for a narrow face. This is the same
[5688.23s -> 5695.45s]  material. No, it's the same thing. Well, whatever. All right. Let's see. I'm just
[5695.45s -> 5702.84s]  going to have to like get it. Somebody said it looked like I got out of the chimney.
[5702.84s -> 5706.68s]  All right. I got my, I had my water and take the last little bit of coffee in here. We're
[5706.68s -> 5710.36s]  going to do this one more time. I'm going to try to kill somebody with a rock.
[5711.88s -> 5715.16s]  I really want to kill someone with a rock. So I'm going to try. And then we're going
[5715.16s -> 5725.42s]  to move on to probably Beat Saber. Either Beat Saber or there's like, there's like,
[5725.42s -> 5729.78s]  I got like three things lined up for tonight. Each one will be about like,
[5729.86s -> 5733.30s]  maybe like an hour or two each. Because like I told you guys before, after like three,
[5733.30s -> 5737.69s]  four hours in this thing, I got to go like take a bath. You see it in real time. I'm
[5737.69s -> 5746.25s]  going to be horrible looking in like another hour or two. All right. Let's get back in.
[5746.89s -> 5754.89s]  Although make sure, cause I, is that in the right spot? Because I had to move. No,
[5754.89s -> 5760.25s]  I think it's good. I literally can't, I can't leave this room and have to move the
[5760.25s -> 5765.02s]  lighthouse to get out of the room. I'm pissed off and like annoyed that I have to
[5765.02s -> 5773.42s]  get this like warped, like paint shit on whatever it is. Like the smears, whatever.
[5773.42s -> 5778.92s]  As long as it doesn't get my hair, which it definitely will. Let me get this untangled.
[5782.20s -> 5796.68s]  This is so tangled. I must've spun around so many times here, but wait down here too.
[5796.68s -> 5809.13s]  God, I got to like step on this and twist it. One second. Sorry. Oh my ass. I can't,
[5809.13s -> 5817.64s]  I'm so glad that this is a waste up scenario here. Where, where levels are like,
[5817.64s -> 5827.50s]  I could get in trouble if this was like a waste down camp. It's like so sweaty and awful.
[5833.78s -> 5845.22s]  Not that, not that way. All right. This should be a little more full. All right. That's good.
[5845.22s -> 5848.66s]  Make sure I can move it out. I can. All right. Let's get back in. I'm ready to do,
[5848.66s -> 5856.63s]  I've got the bow and arrow. I'm going to have some interesting fun. All right.
[5857.43s -> 5864.95s]  Uh, all the levels are good. I'm good. Let's go. Spin this back around. Make sure I'm facing
[5864.95s -> 5888.44s]  the right way. Oh, hold on. There's so much water in here. Okay. I need to get something
[5889.50s -> 5896.74s]  to help clean this shit up. All right. Is this taking screenshots? Why does it keep doing that?
[5904.49s -> 5936.49s]  All right. Let's go. Audio, audio right here. I don't know which one is which,
[5936.49s -> 5952.66s]  which is the right and which is the left. All right, let's go. I got the, where's my bow and
[5952.66s -> 5975.59s]  arrow? Where's my, where's my bow? Wasn't there like a market? What? Is it a quiver? Give me
[5975.59s -> 6004.20s]  those arrows. Okay. What happened to my bow? I have a sword back here now. Am I missing
[6004.20s -> 6017.06s]  something here? Where'd my cool bow go? I haven't even done any environmental stuff.
[6018.14s -> 6046.63s]  Why is it all the way over here? Hello? Why is it in the ground? Whatever. It's not like
[6046.63s -> 6050.47s]  a fucking stick in the ground. That's great. Here, you know what? Couldn't take these then.
[6050.47s -> 6055.88s]  I'll just throw these at people. Fight ended. All right. Uh, I can scroll down.
[6056.60s -> 6065.94s]  How do I do that again? Right. Uh, that was a lot of money. Somebody just gave a lot of money.
[6070.01s -> 6075.75s]  I can't, I don't even know what it was. Uh, it was Freudian, Freudian weapon. Don't mind me
[6075.75s -> 6081.91s]  just derailing your stream. Ha ha ha. I saw it. Got it. Freudian weapon. Thank you so
[6081.91s -> 6088.71s]  much for the $50 and the derail special endless. No, thank you so much. I don't know
[6088.71s -> 6097.19s]  where you are, but thank, I think you're, uh, you should be like here. Thank you so much
[6097.19s -> 6104.15s]  Freudian weapon for the $50 fucking dollars. All right. We've got one V1 classic. There's a few
[6104.15s -> 6112.68s]  more things to try here. Enemies. Let me just do group one. What is this? Multiple enemies,
[6112.68s -> 6120.15s]  but only moan melee attack at a time. Cult versus bandits. Random cult enemies against
[6120.23s -> 6133.96s]  bandits. Am I just like the priest that sit here and watches the melee? Why is that guy
[6133.96s -> 6139.54s]  naked? We're supposed to be fighting each other. Why are you attacking the priest?
[6140.34s -> 6183.80s]  All right. Well, that's my friend. Okay. But that's how that works. My face is really itchy.
[6183.80s -> 6190.68s]  This fucking coal is on my face and it's itching my face and I can't scratch it.
[6191.67s -> 6197.16s]  Oh, get off. Remember what I told? Hold on a second. Remember I told you something was
[6197.16s -> 6208.17s]  going in my eye. This is like freaking me out now. Remember like an hour ago? Oh,
[6208.17s -> 6213.10s]  something's like in my eye. How? This shit is melting off into my fucking eyes.
[6215.62s -> 6223.43s]  All right. I got the edge scratched. Uh, I want to, let me go out. Let me go back out to
[6223.43s -> 6231.62s]  like the menu menu. What is the slow mo? Let me try slow mo of like hitting somebody in the
[6231.62s -> 6295.74s]  head. Get his weapon. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. That was three people. That
[6295.74s -> 6308.95s]  guy's like, Oh, that was weird. I'm trying to like slit his throat. I gotta move on from this
[6308.95s -> 6315.45s]  game, but like there's more to do. I'm like having so much fun. I can't. I gotta like hit
[6315.45s -> 6324.14s]  somebody with another brick. Let's get like only bricks. I'm going to have plenty of cement
[6324.14s -> 6346.86s]  blocks. Okay. Get them all up there. So spell wise, right? Do I have to like go to town
[6346.86s -> 6352.28s]  and like buy shit? I've really only been doing this like weird arena thing. I'm going
[6352.28s -> 6360.97s]  to look into that in a second. Let's get this started. I'm going to try to just hit
[6360.97s -> 6378.04s]  people with fucking blocks. I'm going to rush somebody's head in between two logs. Are you
[6378.04s -> 6413.02s]  ready for this shit? This is so fun. It's too fun. They made a, they gave me,
[6413.02s -> 6423.53s]  they made a game that was too much fun to play on me. What the fuck is happening to me?
[6424.33s -> 6453.46s]  Give it to me. Put it in my hand. Hold an ax. I'm holding this like a fucking soda.
[6475.14s -> 6475.62s]  Come on.
[6543.42s -> 6567.96s]  God damn it. I hit myself in the back. How do you block that? That's not blockable move.
[6567.96s -> 6604.92s]  That's a non blockable move. Fuck. Put it in there. God, just run by it.
[6605.64s -> 6644.66s]  Come on. I want to give it a marathon. Give me the game right. Come here. Get over here.
[6644.66s -> 6645.77s]  Get over here.
[6645.77s -> 6714.66s]  Oh, no. Jump. Give it to me. Give me something. Give me the dagger. What?
[6742.87s -> 6745.83s]  Why did I just do that to her? Why did that just happen?
[6770.01s -> 6795.42s]  Oh, what happened there folks? Shit. Don't have to fucking game fuck me like that.
[6795.82s -> 6840.44s]  I was just sat on this fucking dick. What was that? This is intense. That was what? Medium level
[6840.44s -> 6849.51s]  three? I doubt I wasn't really using the slow-mo that much. All right. Let me go back to the,
[6849.51s -> 6861.94s]  like the menu. Look, I do that. What do we got here? Notes, controller, input,
[6863.34s -> 6883.72s]  all these tips. Go to character, go home. Let's go home. Cool. All right. Let's go.
[6884.68s -> 6892.52s]  Well, now I know I can do this. So fun. All right. Oh, we got this. More things here.
[6893.66s -> 6901.61s]  The market. Someone put a price on your head. Now you're ambushed in town with no way out and
[6901.61s -> 6908.63s]  everyone wants to bounty. It's either you or them. Okay. What about this one? This is the arena
[6908.63s -> 6912.92s]  and this is the ruins. So this is the arena. This one, these are locked.
[6912.92s -> 6927.58s]  Oh, these are work in progress. Okay. Let's go to market. Well, this is cool looking.
[6930.87s -> 6940.78s]  Okay. Interesting place. What's over here? There's like a little blacksmith table.
[6941.50s -> 6947.40s]  At least these weapons. Look at this. Oh, that's a big sword. That's like a bastard sword, right?
[6953.98s -> 6975.42s]  It's a fine blade. It's hard to kind of use it like this though, because you got to use both.
[6976.46s -> 6989.58s]  I'll give it a try. All right. What do we got here? Let's do, let's do easy wave two.
[6990.30s -> 7002.14s]  The well. You can probably throw people down the well, I would assume.
[7003.18s -> 7018.14s]  Do you ask? Two-handed is hard because the controls are so big.
[7020.74s -> 7027.48s]  No, yeah. Two-handed ain't going to work. The controls are too large. They just smash into
[7027.48s -> 7047.43s]  each other. I'm getting like wrapped up again in this cord. I'm like, step over the cord.
[7050.46s -> 7055.43s]  My God. I gotta like, how do you pause the game? I'm like wrapped up again.
[7060.47s -> 7065.56s]  Can't pause real life. Even if there is a cord in the back of your head that is
[7065.56s -> 7072.44s]  wrapping around you like going out and having a dog and having another dog meet you because
[7072.44s -> 7077.48s]  they're on the same sidewalk and then you get wrapped up by the fucking other person's leash
[7077.48s -> 7081.00s]  and you do the thing when you walk around in circles. The dogs are wrapping you both up now
[7082.04s -> 7085.40s]  and you're talking about like the fucking weather. That's what's happening to my
[7085.40s -> 7089.64s]  body right now. There's a dog down here running in circles around two people. Two dogs.
[7090.92s -> 7111.96s]  I'm going for the fucking thrust. What's happened? Did the game just lag? What's happening
[7111.96s -> 7139.50s]  right now? Where did you go from? Oh fucking God, dude. Like really. Look at this shit.
[7160.22s -> 7178.79s]  Getting a ceiling hook? I get like a ceiling tether. No, I gotta get the wireless thing.
[7183.08s -> 7188.20s]  The headset just has to come off because it's just been spun around too many times.
[7188.76s -> 7206.89s]  This cord is like such a thick-ass cord too. Hold on. I gotta get that ceiling tether.
[7206.89s -> 7232.89s]  It's like I'm playing, I'm doing a puzzle right now. Oh, I'm sorry. People are gonna
[7233.13s -> 7247.06s]  throw up from looking at this, aren't they? I'm sorry. It's almost done. Okay. All right. Yeah.
[7247.06s -> 7250.50s]  No, that's it. Have a nice day. No, you got a beautiful dog. Beautiful dog. Yeah. What's his
[7250.50s -> 7273.38s]  name? Oh, Ruff Ruff. Cool. Yeah. Mine's auto. Have a nice day. Fucking hell. All right.
[7273.38s -> 7290.36s]  Last one. I'm gonna go to Beat Saber. I'm gonna make this one count. This game is so
[7290.36s -> 7299.80s]  much fucking fun though. All right. Let's move. I'm gonna grab one more weapon that I haven't
[7299.80s -> 7303.32s]  used. No, I want the bow and arrow. Bow and arrow is so much fun. I have to use the bow
[7303.32s -> 7328.71s]  and arrow. What are you talking about? I don't need more. Okay. Let's get some slow motion
[7328.71s -> 7333.88s]  headshots and then I'm gonna call it. We'll go to Beat Saber. Just do like way three. Easy.
[7333.88s -> 7365.27s]  Go. Spoiled here. Okay. Let's get a slow motion headshot. Oh, got him. I need to get
[7365.27s -> 7416.09s]  a good shot from far away. Ow. I hit my face. Give me the arrow. Give me the fucking arrow.
[7433.64s -> 7503.14s]  Oh. Weapon. Weapon. Needed a weapon. Really? Worth potions? Oh fuck. I didn't hit the wall.
[7503.14s -> 7512.18s]  I didn't hit the wall. I hit the stand that's over here with the lighthouse on it.
[7512.18s -> 7535.72s]  That's all right. We're good. It's Beat Saber time. Too much like. Okay. All right. We're
[7535.72s -> 7543.11s]  good. I'm still seeing. Get some water. Dude, you're sweating. I've been sweating
[7543.11s -> 7549.61s]  this whole time. That's just the way it is. All right. Let's do Beat Saber. That was
[7549.61s -> 7558.86s]  really fucking fun though. So how do I go like this? I think I can just exit from here, right?
[7559.42s -> 7567.85s]  I think I can just quit the game from here. That's like I heard everybody at the same time
[7567.85s -> 7579.53s]  go ooh. Ding. I was like mining fucking coal over here. That's what I'm doing. That's this
[7579.53s -> 7601.27s]  one. Quit this really. Quit this reality. There we go. Play what you want to play. Yeah. I
[7601.27s -> 7616.98s]  want to play Beat Saber. Oh, I think this crashed. I think the sorcerer game crashed.
[7619.14s -> 7630.82s]  Blade and sorcery has not responding. Well, oh well. Let's open Beat Saber. Although somehow
[7630.82s -> 7642.22s]  I can still hear the game. Why can I still hear? Why can I still hear that? You hear the birds?
[7643.02s -> 7665.62s]  Why can I hear birds? What just happened? Oh, SteamVR had to like restart. Oh, okay. There we
[7665.62s -> 7677.69s]  go. Wait, what? Oh, this is like the home thing. Okay. SteamVR home has the birds. I thought it was
[7677.69s -> 7689.96s]  the other game. Let's do Beat Saber. Here it comes. We got a health and safety warning.
[7694.22s -> 7698.65s]  All right. Let's get back in. Playing Beat Saber is dangerous. So you're going to get hurt.
[7700.04s -> 7703.96s]  You're going to mine for coal on the pole. Then how is it? Hopefully I didn't fucking
[7703.96s -> 7711.32s]  cause a problem on that. Those things are expensive. I think we're good though.
[7711.32s -> 7730.71s]  Stay healthy. I'm good. I'm good. I'm healthy. Okay. Booting up. Here it comes. All right.
[7730.71s -> 7733.99s]  A small percentage of people might experience seizures when exposed to certain lights,
[7733.99s -> 7738.41s]  patterns or images. Oh, I'm going to change the... Is there a mod here that can change
[7738.41s -> 7743.62s]  the game to Beat Saber? Cause I can't fucking do it. I'm a little preoccupied.
[7752.01s -> 7767.08s]  Me, me, me. I can see. At least this one I don't have to move around. All right.
[7768.04s -> 7800.07s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Those are going to make me puke if I do this like this.
[7800.79s -> 7824.25s]  Open new window. What the fuck is it then? This is Puke City. Okay. I did just hear it.
[7824.25s -> 7828.65s]  I heard who? I'm sorry everybody. But that was the first thing that happened. That was the
[7828.65s -> 7839.18s]  front page. All right. Here we go. Virtual world. There we go. Beat Saber. All right.
[7839.18s -> 7846.15s]  Update. If you want to refresh it, it'll show up there. Here we go. Beat Saber. Let's do it.
[7846.23s -> 7853.26s]  Get in the game. Let me show you some of my fucking skills. This time I'm not going to
[7853.26s -> 7860.81s]  ding over there. All right. Please read health and safety warnings in your VR headset
[7860.81s -> 7863.61s]  instruction menu before playing Beat Saber because you may be encouraged to perform
[7863.61s -> 7866.81s]  intense actions with your controllers. Make sure to review your surroundings and
[7866.81s -> 7875.54s]  clearing obstacles in your play area. AKA you. High physical activities of all the same
[7875.54s -> 7880.02s]  habits as doing a regular workout. Don't forget to stretch before playing and rest
[7880.02s -> 7888.65s]  regularly. Don't worry. I'll be fine. All right. We got free play. Party. Levels played.
[7889.53s -> 7892.25s]  Welcome. Thanks for purchasing our game. We're a small team working hard to bring you the
[7892.25s -> 7899.30s]  best VR and rhythm experience possible. Cool. All right. Free. Let's just play for free.
[7900.86s -> 7915.06s]  Let's do this tutorial. Holy shit. This is cool. Something about pork.
[7929.45s -> 7942.71s]  Max the color and the direction. This is just like Space Channel 5.
[7952.34s -> 7969.42s]  Do not cut or touch with sabers. Just like Fruit Ninja. Whoa. Make sure they're in the right spot.
[7975.11s -> 7985.37s]  How's the audio? Loud enough? All right. I can barely see. Do like a funny emote if the
[7985.37s -> 7996.87s]  audio is loud enough. I'm not seeing any funny emotes. That must mean. Okay. Hold on.
[7997.67s -> 8019.40s]  There's no audio. What the fuck? What the fuck is that? Why did it do that?
[8019.96s -> 8026.66s]  All right. We should be good. All right. I'm ready. Let's play Beat Saber.
[8026.98s -> 8036.98s]  Stand right here. Free play. Pop stars. This is the one from League of Legends.
[8039.24s -> 8041.80s]  Let's play pop stars from League of Legends.
[8053.06s -> 8059.38s]  What? Whoa. Hey, I don't want to join anybody's group. Why is this on? Why is this on here?
[8092.38s -> 8096.70s]  I'm losing the audio in my ear. Let's both fall out.
[8135.14s -> 8140.50s]  How long is this song?
[8141.14s -> 8148.22s]  League of Legends. What a fucked video game that is. What the fuck does that have to do with League of Legends?
[8149.74s -> 8151.66s]  Is this one of the characters singing the song?
[8151.66s -> 8262.01s]  I'm going to beat. I'm going to beat. I'll take a beat. B for boomer. Nice KD.
[8265.77s -> 8268.73s]  It's a little loud. All right. Yeah. It looks, it does look a little loud, doesn't it?
[8269.37s -> 8276.71s]  That's better. It was way too loud. It's all right. B for boomer. I'm going back in.
[8280.33s -> 8284.68s]  This is really, really cool. I mean, I kind of have to like close my mouth and just play
[8284.68s -> 8301.56s]  it, but this is fucking fun. You just like kind of zone in. How am I doing? That's a hair look.
[8301.56s -> 8307.64s]  Let's do it again. Another one. What's, what's like a good song? What would you guys say is
[8307.64s -> 8312.18s]  the best Beat Saber song? Let's take a look. Let's do, let's get it on hard and I gotta
[8312.18s -> 8319.11s]  get ready. Okay. This is let, no, get. Well, who made that? Okay. What does this mean?
[8319.99s -> 8326.82s]  Just single, solo, standard, one Saber. Okay. No arrows. Oh, I don't know about that one.
[8334.42s -> 8353.56s]  Is this this one artist? Do I, how do I play like other ones? This is all songs I have.
[8354.28s -> 8424.98s]  Let's try it. Make it a fuck for me on that one. Oh, God damn it. I don't, get out of my head.
[8451.30s -> 8457.21s]  Steam notifications. I don't know how many times you have to turn off steam notifications
[8457.21s -> 8462.49s]  and like delete it from your goddamn inventory, but it never stops. This one's
[8462.49s -> 8590.89s]  better. I like this one. Let's start it up. Come on. Damn it. They fuck with you a little
[8590.89s -> 8620.60s]  bit there. They fuck with you. A B? I'll take a B. Solo free play. Okay. All right. Looking
[8620.60s -> 8627.02s]  good. How do you get more songs though? What's the other one? What's the other League
[8627.02s -> 8634.79s]  of Legends song? Bring it on. Fucking expert. Let's go. You don't think I know what I'm
[8634.79s -> 8724.54s]  doing? Don't, what the fuck valve? This is hard. This song's not even good. I don't like
[8724.54s -> 8778.30s]  this song. It's a song on YouTube videos. This is a YouTuber song, right? Now this
[8778.30s -> 8794.97s]  one's on a, this one's like easy though. So this is like a, oh, I'm going to hurt
[8794.97s -> 8879.05s]  myself. I can do this on expert. Do I unlock songs? All right. We're going to do one
[8879.05s -> 8979.90s]  more on expert. I thought, I can't, you kind of can't do the expert ones unless you,
[8979.90s -> 8986.95s]  until you figure out like the muscle memory for the beat, can you? All right. Where's
[8986.95s -> 8996.42s]  like the custom shit? How do I do the custom stuff? What's happening here? It's
[8996.42s -> 9011.18s]  almost like for experts. This is really, really fucking fun. Songs, songs, songs.
[9013.88s -> 9017.48s]  You need mods. You need mods. You need mods. Okay. All right. All right.
[9028.28s -> 9035.21s]  Why do I look so feral? Go to the GitHub. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9035.21s -> 9053.56s]  Does this have like steam workshop? I have to go to GitHub? Okay. There's no
[9053.56s -> 9060.94s]  workshop. Oh, all right. Well, how, let me just get this installed then. And then
[9060.94s -> 9065.98s]  where do you get the songs? From beatsaber.com? No, that's not real. That's a fake
[9065.98s -> 9086.78s]  website. Is it really beatsaber? So install them from in the game. Okay. So let me
[9086.78s -> 9096.14s]  just get this then. All right. How do I, they probably install custom mods.
[9096.78s -> 9100.06s]  This uses modsaber to get the latest approved and manually verified mods,
[9100.14s -> 9104.87s]  latest version automatically. Okay. So modsaber. This program currently supports
[9104.87s -> 9114.25s]  every approved mod on modsaber.org. Okay. Song loader, camera plus song
[9114.25s -> 9126.50s]  browser. There's a lot of shit here. Gameplay changes. I might, okay, here's
[9126.50s -> 9130.17s]  what I'm going to do. I'm going to hold onto this for tomorrow night. I'm
[9130.17s -> 9133.62s]  going to go get a bunch of shit. I need to like close the game. Let me
[9133.62s -> 9137.88s]  get this for tomorrow. Let me get like all the shit that's necessary for
[9137.88s -> 9144.15s]  it. And I'll like make sure it's, it's up and running and good because we're
[9144.15s -> 9149.80s]  going to do it tomorrow night anyway. So I'll get, I'll get a bunch of good
[9149.80s -> 9160.42s]  songs. Like country road. And I also need to get the mod that lets me
[9160.42s -> 9163.62s]  like look at my hand and I, I discord channel to suggest songs.
[9167.67s -> 9173.37s]  Yeah. I have the program. I have that VR drop program, but I couldn't
[9173.37s -> 9176.09s]  get it to work. I could get it to open up chat, but I was trying to
[9176.09s -> 9179.61s]  get it to like stay on my hand and how do I, you know, there's a lot
[9179.61s -> 9182.73s]  of me to kind of do before that. I look haggard. I mean, it's because I
[9182.73s -> 9186.65s]  have this, this shit on my face. All right, let's do, I'm going to do like
[9186.65s -> 9188.73s]  a couple more, just the default ones and then we'll move on to,
[9190.33s -> 9197.83s]  what's the other game that I got here? I got, I have, I have budget
[9197.83s -> 9209.50s]  cuts. Let me do a few more. Yeah. This super hot VR, I get so much
[9209.50s -> 9214.42s]  to play. I'm going to try to do like three, three games, three to
[9214.42s -> 9219.08s]  four games a night, each game for about an hour. And then we're going
[9219.08s -> 9221.08s]  to, I'm going to, I'm going like two or three days straight here, guys.
[9223.42s -> 9229.06s]  Let me do one more of these fun ones and we'll, we'll go to budget cuts
[9230.07s -> 9235.51s]  for like an hour or two. But I just, I just didn't know that you had
[9235.51s -> 9251.74s]  to, Jeff, stop, stop, stop, stop it. Let's go.
[9270.97s -> 9322.54s]  Fuck! I don't know how that, I don't know how that part goes.
[9323.59s -> 9372.89s]  Don't do it. I did expert first try on that, that's a C, but it's the
[9372.89s -> 9376.17s]  first time I've ever heard that song. I've never even heard that song
[9376.17s -> 9433.00s]  before. I, I started to get it. I started to figure it out. Let's do
[9433.00s -> 9510.38s]  that one on hard. When they switch it up on you like that. I think
[9510.38s -> 9513.32s]  I got to the place of no return here and I'll tell you what I mean
[9513.32s -> 9567.78s]  by that in a minute. So here's what I mean by that. Once you do hard
[9567.78s -> 9572.02s]  and expert and you, especially expert, certain sections,
[9573.91s -> 9576.87s]  certain sections of every one of these levels now, not on expert,
[9576.87s -> 9580.95s]  feels too easy and certain sections are way too hard. You know what I
[9580.95s -> 9583.51s]  mean? Like, I feel like I should have just done, but normal is,
[9583.51s -> 9588.23s]  easy is too easy. I went, I did, I got, I went, pointed on return.
[9589.69s -> 9599.53s]  All right, last one. Here we go. Did I already do this one? No, I
[9599.53s -> 9638.47s]  didn't do this one today. I definitely didn't. See, like,
[9638.47s -> 9642.31s]  this is too easy. You know what I mean? I've ruined it. Now I
[9642.31s -> 9708.84s]  have to play this on expert. Whoa, whoa, I got cocky. Don't get
[9708.84s -> 9770.58s]  cocky. I almost had a hundred percent. A B. How do you get a B
[9770.58s -> 9775.42s]  with 293 out of 295? That's an A, that's an A plus. All right,
[9775.50s -> 9777.66s]  now let me, like, eat my words. Do expert plus.
[9809.13s -> 9822.18s]  That's fucking hard. Do it again? Again? No, we'll do this
[9822.18s -> 9828.94s]  tomorrow. Holy fuck. I look like I'm supposed to be in a
[9828.94s -> 9836.01s]  Ghostbusters movie or something. I look like shit. All right,
[9836.01s -> 9842.20s]  let's, let's take our, let's take our final break of the
[9842.20s -> 9848.38s]  evening. I'm going to get some more water and then, and then
[9848.38s -> 9854.22s]  I'm going to open budget cuts and we'll play that for like
[9854.30s -> 9858.14s]  an hour or two. And then I'm going to take my, my actual
[9858.14s -> 9861.45s]  break from VR and we're going to go again tomorrow. So give
[9861.45s -> 9869.96s]  me one second. Let me get another glass of water. Coal
[9869.96s -> 9877.19s]  miner. Oh yeah. Well, first impressions of the Vive. The
[9877.19s -> 9882.68s]  Vive is a hundred times better than PSVR. I would
[9882.68s -> 9887.82s]  probably say safely. I'll be right back. Give me like two
[9887.82s -> 10127.74s]  minutes. Okay, so let us get back in. Look at my hair.
[10128.38s -> 10132.65s]  Can you imagine if I were to go, like I kind of want to go
[10132.65s -> 10138.57s]  sit down like after today or tomorrow and go to a barber
[10138.57s -> 10142.73s]  or a salon and just sit down and just be like, yeah, um,
[10142.73s -> 10144.65s]  you know, I'm not sure what to do with it. Maybe you
[10144.65s -> 10149.72s]  can have some suggestions on what I should do. Jesus
[10149.72s -> 10160.39s]  fucking Christ. It's like matted up animal hair. Like
[10160.39s -> 10162.63s]  that's, that's the kind of scenario with the lady or
[10163.03s -> 10165.83s]  whoever it is, whoever it's like, that's a salon cut in
[10165.83s -> 10169.22s]  your hair. You need to go to the doctor. Like you've got
[10169.22s -> 10172.10s]  to go to like a surgeon to get this fixed. I can't do
[10172.10s -> 10178.76s]  it for you. Get a hair net. No, I gotta get like a
[10178.76s -> 10190.01s]  haircut. All right, here we go. Let's get back in.
[10190.01s -> 10192.01s]  I'm not sure how this works, but I'm going to turn
[10192.01s -> 10198.39s]  this on so you should see me here. BRB needs to get
[10198.39s -> 10200.55s]  out of here. Budget cuts is this next game. This is
[10200.55s -> 10210.66s]  going to be the last one tonight. Wish me luck and
[10210.66s -> 10216.74s]  we'll be back tomorrow. What's going on here? Oh,
[10216.74s -> 10219.30s]  fuck. Right. Hold on. I screwed this up. I'm going
[10219.30s -> 10225.64s]  to move this back. The lighthouse has to move back
[10225.64s -> 10236.50s]  where it belongs. Here. It's good. Communicate
[10236.50s -> 10240.81s]  for a second. Uh, headset is not tracking. Not
[10240.81s -> 10242.81s]  ready. Not ready. Not ready. Uh huh. I know it'll
[10242.81s -> 10247.46s]  be ready in just a moment. There it is. All
[10247.46s -> 10265.37s]  right. I'm going in. See you soon. Space camp too
[10265.37s -> 10297.93s]  big. See you in an hour. Yeah. Ma, leave me
[10297.93s -> 10302.17s]  alone, Ma. I'll do my homework in an hour. I'm
[10302.17s -> 10314.82s]  currently in the oasis. Don't talk to me. Hold
[10314.82s -> 10322.02s]  both. It's a start. Figure my controller. Don't
[10322.02s -> 10331.22s]  you do it. In cords. Okay. Hold both pads to
[10331.22s -> 10337.46s]  start budget cut story mode. That's not what I
[10337.46s -> 10347.61s]  wanted to do. Hold both pads. What the hell
[10347.61s -> 10351.85s]  is that? Budget cuts arcade. Wait. Hold both
[10351.85s -> 10355.61s]  pads. That's an okay. Here we go. Room scale
[10355.61s -> 10360.12s]  360 tracking. That's what I got. Sound effects,
[10360.20s -> 10377.18s]  music. Okay. That's the one. Continue. Empty
[10377.18s -> 10380.06s]  slot. Let's go. Difficulty standard graphics
[10380.06s -> 10385.24s]  quality. Uh, I don't think it matters. Initializing
[10385.24s -> 10387.08s]  cat seat. Look at over there. Look right
[10387.08s -> 10389.16s]  there. Look at that. That's the one I hit
[10389.16s -> 10392.04s]  by the way. Initializing. Calibrating space
[10392.04s -> 10397.78s]  time. Please hold. I got battery halfway. I
[10397.78s -> 10400.26s]  can, I can hear you guys. Don't worry. I
[10400.26s -> 10412.60s]  got it. I'm in the oasis. Leave me alone.
[10412.60s -> 10424.26s]  Let's just take this along. Initializing.
[10424.26s -> 10426.18s]  Done. Calibrating space time. Please hold.
[10427.22s -> 10433.03s]  Can you take it? Come on. Dinner's in the
[10433.03s -> 10443.94s]  oven. Come on. This is supposed to take
[10443.94s -> 10454.30s]  this long. Okay. Jesus. Try picking stuff
[10454.30s -> 10460.94s]  up. Is it one of these games? Okay. Now
[10460.94s -> 10464.66s]  press and hold this tiny button in your
[10464.66s -> 10468.54s]  non-dominant hand. Bring this, bring,
[10468.54s -> 10470.94s]  bring tool handle here. Hold the trigger
[10470.94s -> 10477.70s]  to fire. Press any of the grip buttons
[10477.70s -> 10492.41s]  to translocate. So you, that's how you
[10492.41s -> 10498.73s]  move. Or is it? That's how you move.
[10498.73s -> 10512.94s]  Okay. I'm fucking nuts. Can I do it? All
[10512.94s -> 10517.50s]  right. Let's go. That's freaking me
[10517.50s -> 10522.86s]  out. No, no. Okay. So we got a light
[10522.86s -> 10526.79s]  switch. Turn it off. That hurts. What
[10526.79s -> 10528.39s]  did I just turn off? No. Put the
[10528.39s -> 10529.91s]  budget back on. Put the fucking budget
[10529.91s -> 10531.83s]  back on. All right. Back over this way.
[10536.81s -> 10539.32s]  Turn on the lights. Sure thing.
[10543.13s -> 10558.62s]  What do you want to do? Laser secure
[10558.62s -> 10576.44s]  anti-spy vent. Perfect. Okay. Can I sit
[10576.44s -> 10577.88s]  on the couch? I can go over there. I
[10577.88s -> 10584.47s]  can look at this. Computer. We got
[10584.47s -> 10585.83s]  some other shit here. What's that?
[10585.83s -> 10588.47s]  There's a wall right here. There's a
[10588.47s -> 10589.67s]  wall right here. I don't know which
[10589.67s -> 10590.79s]  one, but I know that it's there.
[10598.71s -> 10605.19s]  Nothing in this. What's that? It's
[10605.19s -> 10611.98s]  something. Is it brick? It's just
[10611.98s -> 10620.18s]  bricks. Come on. There's no smashing
[10620.18s -> 10630.31s]  sounds. Okay. You can't fucking leave
[10630.31s -> 10636.39s]  me alone. I'm assuming I can take
[10636.39s -> 10642.34s]  that off. Okay. Yeah. What's in
[10642.34s -> 10645.35s]  there? There's tape in that room.
[10645.35s -> 10656.30s]  Sure. And where's the wall? The
[10656.30s -> 10682.07s]  actual wall. Okay. Now what the hell
[10682.07s -> 10689.88s]  do you want me to do? What's that?
[10689.88s -> 10693.58s]  Key card? Hold this touchpad to open
[10693.58s -> 10695.90s]  your inventory. Use your other hand
[10695.90s -> 10703.90s]  to drop items into this bubble. Okay.
[10703.90s -> 10705.74s]  I got that. How many things can I
[10705.74s -> 10713.34s]  hold? Wall coming up. Did it take the
[10713.34s -> 10722.65s]  paintbrush? The tape? Caution, wet
[10722.65s -> 10731.67s]  paint. Okay. Well, I have the
[10731.67s -> 10739.62s]  key card to one. It looks like
[10739.62s -> 10742.02s]  we're going over there. Well, it's
[10742.02s -> 10749.06s]  two. Can I do something weird here?
[10750.66s -> 10755.10s]  Is there a one back here?
[10760.30s -> 10783.86s]  Oh. Oh. Well, I thought that the
[10783.86s -> 10785.62s]  one was that you got to use this on
[10785.62s -> 10786.98s]  one. You can't go on two until you
[10786.98s -> 10796.84s]  get the code for two.
[10813.75s -> 10817.05s]  Three hours earlier. Organic matter
[10817.05s -> 10821.77s]  here. Keep it. Alan! Alan! Alan! Alan!
[10821.77s -> 10823.69s]  I can hear you, Kate. I'm just
[10823.69s -> 10826.44s]  choosing not to respond.
[10826.68s -> 10830.20s]  Okay, then. Sure. Fine. I guess you
[10830.20s -> 10831.56s]  don't want to know about where all
[10831.56s -> 10832.60s]  our colleagues have been
[10832.60s -> 10835.40s]  disappearing to. Professional. Wait.
[10835.40s -> 10837.64s]  Okay, guests. I do want to know.
[10837.64s -> 10839.16s]  I did the YouTuber joke. You gotta
[10839.16s -> 10842.44s]  laugh. I'm divided attention.
[10842.44s -> 10844.04s]  Well, I heard from Tracy the
[10844.04s -> 10845.48s]  county that all the humans in her
[10845.48s -> 10848.04s]  department have been reported to HR.
[10848.04s -> 10849.98s]  They're human. Of course they're in
[10849.98s -> 10851.90s]  violation of HR. That's where the
[10851.90s -> 10854.54s]  phrase comes from. Human nature.
[10854.54s -> 10857.74s]  Did you even listen in our orientation?
[10857.74s -> 10861.34s]  Yes. But what you don't know is, is
[10861.34s -> 10863.34s]  that they never come back.
[10863.34s -> 10865.74s]  That's for you. You ain't going on
[10865.74s -> 10868.30s]  that trip, Dickhead. Are you sure?
[10868.30s -> 10871.10s]  Positive. They had a meeting with HR
[10871.10s -> 10875.16s]  and then, Poof! Never seen again.
[10875.16s -> 10877.32s]  Hey, you, too. That is worrying.
[10877.32s -> 10879.96s]  Back to work. I do hope they're all
[10879.96s -> 10884.78s]  right. All right. Okay. Open the
[10884.78s -> 10887.35s]  briefcase.
[10887.35s -> 10891.75s]  Press staple. All right. Hold that
[10891.75s -> 10895.91s]  there.
[10895.91s -> 10900.76s]  What are these drugs?
[10900.76s -> 10904.12s]  No, but I need this.
[10904.12s -> 10908.20s]  This pager was mailed to you. Enjoy.
[10908.20s -> 10910.68s]  The next challenge is disruptive.
[10910.68s -> 10915.03s]  What is it? Telephone? Hello?
[10915.03s -> 10916.63s]  How do I use the phone?
[10916.63s -> 10931.91s]  Do I press the button?
[10931.91s -> 10939.91s]  Okay, you gotta hold. Okay, I got it.
[10939.91s -> 10941.43s]  Ready?
[10944.31s -> 10946.86s]  No, not that. Not 1982.
[10946.86s -> 10950.94s]  Nineteen eighty-five.
[10950.94s -> 10954.34s]  Hello, can you hear me? My name is
[10954.34s -> 10956.50s]  Winta. And look, we can do the cute
[10956.50s -> 10957.78s]  introductions later.
[10957.78s -> 10960.42s]  You're in terrible danger. People
[10960.42s -> 10962.02s]  keep disappearing around here.
[10962.02s -> 10963.62s]  And I hate to tell you, but they're
[10963.62s -> 10964.98s]  coming for you next.
[10964.98s -> 10966.18s]  Now, I'm gonna help you get out of
[10966.18s -> 10968.58s]  here, but we have to move quickly.
[10968.58s -> 10971.30s]  See that locked briefcase? I hid the
[10971.30s -> 10976.68s]  key for it on your desk.
[10976.68s -> 10978.68s]  Wait, wait, wait! What's the objective? What?
[10978.68s -> 10980.12s]  Get out of the building as fast as you
[10980.12s -> 10982.68s]  can. What's the objective?
[10982.68s -> 10984.60s]  Put it in your inventory.
[10984.60s -> 10986.44s]  I'll ping you once you're clear. Now
[10986.44s -> 10988.04s]  stay low and hurry.
[10988.04s -> 10989.64s]  You can make it, but you have to go
[10989.64s -> 10998.28s]  now. Your desk is a key
[10998.28s -> 11000.36s]  under the pot and there's a
[11000.36s -> 11004.15s]  translocator in there.
[11004.15s -> 11008.34s]  And then you need to death bad
[11008.34s -> 11011.78s]  jump from the building.
[11011.78s -> 11012.90s]  From the elevator, go to the third
[11012.90s -> 11016.92s]  floor. That's me.
[11016.92s -> 11026.31s]  Hey, uh, hey, this is me.
[11026.31s -> 11034.52s]  It's me. I'll put that in your prayer.
[11034.52s -> 11041.14s]  All right, key behind plant. Key under
[11041.14s -> 11042.74s]  the plant. Key? There's a key over the
[11042.74s -> 11047.38s]  under the plant here.
[11047.38s -> 11053.94s]  Which plant? You scared me! Where's the
[11053.94s -> 11058.50s]  plant?
[11058.50s -> 11069.67s]  Did I call the number again? Hold on.
[11069.67s -> 11071.03s]  This is how the matrix starts. You
[11071.03s -> 11072.95s]  need to leave right now.
[11072.95s -> 11074.23s]  There's a key to the travel device
[11074.23s -> 11076.15s]  hidden on your desk. Grab the pager,
[11076.15s -> 11077.99s]  put it in your inventory, and get off
[11077.99s -> 11080.79s]  this floor any way you can.
[11080.79s -> 11082.39s]  Right, all right, so it was the plant.
[11082.39s -> 11106.73s]  It's in the plant.
[11106.73s -> 11112.04s]  Got it. How much money is in here?
[11112.04s -> 11113.40s]  Oh, this is not a bucket. This is my
[11113.40s -> 11115.72s]  walk. Beware. Do not do anything
[11115.72s -> 11117.56s]  weird. Top secret.
[11117.56s -> 11122.87s]  Move your controller to equip the
[11122.87s -> 11130.38s]  translocator.
[11131.75s -> 11133.67s]  Okay, uh, now it's time to go. I
[11133.67s -> 11134.87s]  gotta get to the... Let me take these
[11134.87s -> 11135.99s]  because I'm gonna, I'm scared I'm
[11135.99s -> 11136.95s]  gonna need them.
[11136.95s -> 11137.91s]  I'm gonna forget how to do
[11137.91s -> 11140.71s]  everything. Reading emails.
[11140.71s -> 11144.15s]  Okay. So, uh, your desk, go out,
[11144.15s -> 11145.35s]  find the elevator, go to the third
[11145.35s -> 11147.43s]  floor, and find me.
[11147.43s -> 11152.01s]  You got it. Third floor, elevator.
[11152.01s -> 11166.49s]  How about...
[11170.49s -> 11173.96s]  I can only show you the door. You are
[11173.96s -> 11176.84s]  the one that must walk through.
[11176.84s -> 11186.30s]  There's an open window. Fruit travels
[11186.30s -> 11188.06s]  through the air similar to a banana.
[11188.06s -> 11189.66s]  Okay, so everything travels through
[11189.66s -> 11205.64s]  the air similar to a banana.
[11205.64s -> 11207.32s]  What is considered great at one point
[11207.32s -> 11208.60s]  in time may or not have the connection
[11208.60s -> 11209.88s]  to something previously considered
[11209.88s -> 11211.32s]  small.
[11211.32s -> 11220.57s]  I made it. Every day is taco day.
[11220.57s -> 11232.06s]  Yeah, sure. All right, we're in.
[11232.06s -> 11233.35s]  Find the elevator, go to the third
[11233.35s -> 11236.09s]  floor. Itchy nose, hold on.
[11236.09s -> 11243.11s]  Every day is taco day.
[11243.11s -> 11247.58s]  What do we got? Soda?
[11247.58s -> 11258.38s]  Did you eat something? I don't know
[11258.38s -> 11292.98s]  you could do that.
[11293.06s -> 11299.05s]  Well there. No, no, no, no, no. Go back
[11299.05s -> 11299.85s]  out.
[11299.85s -> 11335.74s]  Oh, whoopsie. You know, fuck off.
[11335.74s -> 11378.06s]  Oh, hello. Get over here.
[11378.06s -> 11384.76s]  That was close. I can't kill him. I'm
[11384.76s -> 11395.24s]  trying. I'm trying to kill him.
[11395.24s -> 11400.55s]  How could you? Damn it, man. Give me
[11400.55s -> 11409.48s]  the fucking ashtray.
[11409.48s -> 11416.92s]  Hey, look over here. Your point.
[11416.92s -> 11418.52s]  This is a fucking ashtray, dude. How
[11418.60s -> 11435.13s]  many? Oh, fuck what I hit. I don't know.
[11435.13s -> 11465.64s]  Run out of time. Let's go. Get out
[11465.64s -> 11468.12s]  there.
[11468.12s -> 11487.69s]  Where is she? Tell me where she is.
[11487.69s -> 11488.89s]  All right, what do we do? Gonna go to
[11488.89s -> 11500.79s]  the elevator, right? It's like fighting
[11500.79s -> 11503.38s]  back.
[11503.38s -> 11507.00s]  I don't know where I am in my room.
[11507.00s -> 11508.28s]  No, it's okay. Another person throw
[11508.28s -> 11515.62s]  out a window. Cookie? All right, I need
[11515.62s -> 11539.43s]  the elevator. Can I get a water?
[11539.43s -> 11541.11s]  Where's that? Oh, there's coffee right
[11541.11s -> 11552.38s]  there. Give me that.
[11552.38s -> 11556.25s]  Give me coffee. I want the coffee. Well,
[11556.25s -> 11557.61s]  how am I gonna get fucking coffee out of
[11557.61s -> 11560.30s]  this thing?
[11560.30s -> 11576.76s]  All right, let's go.
[11578.42s -> 11582.92s]  Uh, what can you do for me? Anything?
[11582.92s -> 11584.60s]  Who is this handsome devil with the
[11584.60s -> 11586.76s]  death-set tones reaching out to me
[11586.76s -> 11588.36s]  over the tannoy?
[11588.36s -> 11592.28s]  Rex. Gold cup with ash or honey?
[11592.28s -> 11594.20s]  And there's plenty of ways to describe
[11594.20s -> 11595.24s]  me.
[11595.24s -> 11597.16s]  International business playboy
[11597.16s -> 11599.64s]  superstar. The writer is genius.
[11599.64s -> 11602.52s]  That's so funny.
[11602.52s -> 11610.89s]  Now 775 lost in time.
[11610.89s -> 11616.15s]  Uh, I need to get something from you.
[11616.15s -> 11619.38s]  Another day? Another dollar?
[11619.38s -> 11622.26s]  Oh, no.
[11622.26s -> 11625.14s]  Hello human. I am very busy with my
[11625.14s -> 11628.46s]  tasks. Can we be friends?
[11628.46s -> 11630.30s]  Uh, I don't know. You got anything
[11630.30s -> 11631.98s]  under there for Elbertson?
[11631.98s -> 11637.03s]  Fuck you. Here's the elevator. I found it.
[11637.03s -> 11638.23s]  Level three.
[11638.31s -> 11649.70s]  Do I need money? That's a wall.
[11649.70s -> 11654.15s]  All right, do I have a soda? All right,
[11654.15s -> 11655.43s]  hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Get rid of
[11655.43s -> 11657.11s]  this. I don't need that anymore.
[11657.11s -> 11658.41s]  I don't need this anymore. I need to
[11658.41s -> 11659.61s]  know what you look like, Phil. Let's
[11659.61s -> 11660.65s]  take a couple sodas.
[11660.65s -> 11663.05s]  Let's get some sodas. At least one or
[11663.05s -> 11665.13s]  two. I need to have a whole lunch.
[11665.13s -> 11668.78s]  All right, I got a whole lunch now. We got
[11668.78s -> 11671.42s]  apple, cookie, two sodas.
[11671.42s -> 11678.39s]  Perfect American lunch.
[11678.39s -> 11682.15s]  The wall. What am I gonna touch? I
[11682.15s -> 11687.77s]  don't know. Gonna be very slow.
[11689.24s -> 11698.57s]  Floor three, right? Bingo. Let's go.
[11698.57s -> 11706.49s]  360 degrees of fun.
[11706.49s -> 11710.57s]  Supervision Acquisitions HR COM team.
[11710.57s -> 11714.01s]  And that guy. That guy over there.
[11714.01s -> 11716.55s]  We got a new phone. Wait, mission
[11716.55s -> 11720.58s]  objective updated.
[11720.58s -> 11725.16s]  204- what the- okay.
[11725.16s -> 11732.84s]  2048. Isn't that like an iPhone game?
[11732.84s -> 11739.62s]  No. No.
[11739.62s -> 11742.50s]  Right, you made it. The quickest way to the exit is
[11742.50s -> 11744.18s]  via the acquisitions department, but
[11744.18s -> 11746.18s]  there are robots of the unfriendly kind
[11746.18s -> 11748.66s]  of head. TransCorp insists on using
[11748.66s -> 11750.42s]  military-grade assault robots for
[11750.42s -> 11751.94s]  supervisor duties.
[11751.94s -> 11755.38s]  So efficient. Not. Use the stealth
[11755.38s -> 11756.98s]  feature on the translocator to avoid
[11756.98s -> 11757.70s]  alerting them.
[11757.70s -> 11760.10s]  Stealth feature? You'll need an access card.
[11760.10s -> 11761.46s]  I think the manager on this floor
[11761.46s -> 11762.42s]  might have one.
[11762.42s -> 11764.34s]  Grab it and head to acquisitions. Good
[11764.34s -> 11766.74s]  luck. Okay.
[11766.74s -> 11770.94s]  So I have a- is this stealth?
[11770.94s -> 11775.26s]  Is this my stealth right now?
[11775.26s -> 11778.18s]  This is like a bug net. I don't know
[11778.18s -> 11780.02s]  what to do.
[11780.02s -> 11792.73s]  The stealth feature. Oh, I was probably
[11792.73s -> 11793.85s]  going to call you back.
[11793.85s -> 11795.29s]  Get to acquisitions. Might need a key
[11795.29s -> 11797.85s]  card. I have a key card, didn't I?
[11797.85s -> 11800.33s]  I have a key card. What happened to one?
[11800.33s -> 11803.96s]  Did I throw the key card down?
[11803.96s -> 11805.72s]  Okay, watch out. That first- that guy's
[11805.72s -> 11807.32s]  going to shoot at me.
[11807.32s -> 11809.06s]  And there is a stealth- I don't even
[11809.06s -> 11810.98s]  know what this does.
[11810.98s -> 11832.79s]  Use the stealth feature. You know-
[11834.65s -> 11836.65s]  I'm just gonna fucking go over there.
[11836.65s -> 11839.93s]  I'll get a tutorial right now, won't I?
[11839.93s -> 11841.77s]  All right, where's my tutorial?
[11841.77s -> 11843.29s]  Friends, I'm sure you
[11843.29s -> 11845.13s]  already noticed your brand new
[11845.13s -> 11847.37s]  supervisor colleagues have leaked.
[11847.37s -> 11849.85s]  I have a difficult enough job keeping
[11849.85s -> 11850.73s]  everyone
[11850.73s -> 11852.97s]  focused on the task at hand.
[11852.97s -> 11854.73s]  The setup let their bandits concern
[11854.73s -> 11855.45s]  you?
[11855.45s -> 11858.25s]  No, really. Don't.
[11858.25s -> 11865.69s]  I don't know.
[11865.77s -> 11868.97s]  I thought it was like a fucking scrambler.
[11868.97s -> 11871.93s]  Hope both paths to reapply.
[11871.93s -> 11889.98s]  All right, mission objective updated.
[11889.98s -> 11891.26s]  Yeah, but
[11891.26s -> 11896.06s]  how the hell do I do the thing?
[11896.06s -> 11901.82s]  Listen again.
[11901.82s -> 11905.93s]  All right, you made it. The quickest
[11905.93s -> 11907.21s]  way to the exit is via the
[11907.21s -> 11908.41s]  acquisitions department.
[11908.41s -> 11910.33s]  There are robots of the unfriendly
[11910.33s -> 11911.61s]  kind ahead.
[11911.61s -> 11913.53s]  Transcorp insists on using military
[11913.53s -> 11915.29s]  grade assault robots for supervisor
[11915.29s -> 11916.89s]  duties. They use a handout.
[11916.89s -> 11920.01s]  Efficient. Not. Use the stealth feature
[11920.01s -> 11921.69s]  on the translocator to avoid alerting
[11921.69s -> 11922.49s]  them.
[11922.49s -> 11926.09s]  Oh, you'll need an access card.
[11926.09s -> 11929.37s]  The stealth feature?
[11929.37s -> 11934.90s]  They didn't tell me this last time.
[11934.90s -> 11936.42s]  When portal is open, press and hold to
[11936.42s -> 11937.78s]  translocate silently.
[11937.78s -> 11944.65s]  They didn't tell me that before.
[11944.65s -> 11947.13s]  Friends, I'm sure you already noticed
[11947.13s -> 11949.45s]  your brand new supervisor colleagues
[11949.45s -> 11950.33s]  have leaked.
[11950.33s -> 11952.81s]  I have a difficult enough job keeping
[11952.81s -> 11955.85s]  everyone focused on the task at hand.
[11955.85s -> 11957.69s]  Just don't let their methods concern
[11957.69s -> 11958.41s]  you.
[11958.41s -> 11961.37s]  No really, don't let their methods
[11961.37s -> 11963.93s]  concern you.
[11963.93s -> 11965.69s]  Don't look, don't look, don't look.
[11965.69s -> 11966.57s]  I don't know if that is what I'm
[11966.57s -> 11968.01s]  taking.
[11968.01s -> 11972.07s]  Achievement unlocked. I got a crab.
[11972.07s -> 11975.43s]  Everything seems quiet. Maybe
[11975.43s -> 11981.24s]  too quiet. Is that a window?
[11981.24s -> 11982.36s]  Fucking gods, I thought it was an
[11982.36s -> 11985.27s]  open window.
[11985.35s -> 11988.15s]  I thought it was an open, I thought it was
[11988.15s -> 11993.29s]  and why would that have helped anyways?
[11993.29s -> 11994.73s]  How would he have even done anything
[11994.73s -> 11996.09s]  about that? He would have, I thought
[11996.09s -> 11997.13s]  he was going to look down like metal
[11997.13s -> 11998.49s]  gear solid or something.
[11998.49s -> 12006.58s]  All right, I got it, I got it. I gotta
[12006.58s -> 12008.10s]  turn it on. I know, I know, just look.
[12008.10s -> 12009.38s]  I'm gonna dial the number.
[12009.38s -> 12013.90s]  I know the fucking phone number already.
[12013.90s -> 12029.38s]  Lady, just. Okay, here we go.
[12029.38s -> 12031.14s]  What's in there?
[12031.14s -> 12032.02s]  Manager.
[12032.02s -> 12034.26s]  New supervisor colleagues have leaked.
[12034.26s -> 12036.74s]  I have a difficult enough job keeping
[12036.74s -> 12039.78s]  everyone focused on the task at hand.
[12039.86s -> 12042.42s]  Sit up. Let their methods concern you.
[12042.42s -> 12045.38s]  No really. Don't let their methods
[12045.38s -> 12046.90s]  concern you. Manager's office is right
[12046.90s -> 12051.08s]  there.
[12051.08s -> 12054.52s]  I watch all the things. I see all the
[12054.52s -> 12059.16s]  things. I shoot all the things.
[12059.16s -> 12062.25s]  See ya. Okay, I'm in the manager's
[12062.25s -> 12068.04s]  office. I made it.
[12068.04s -> 12077.50s]  Manager's desk? Okay, manager's desk.
[12077.50s -> 12078.62s]  Don't have the urge to throw a
[12078.62s -> 12079.82s]  fucking rock over there. I know you
[12079.82s -> 12082.94s]  want to.
[12082.94s -> 12084.86s]  Anything in the filing cabinets? No.
[12084.86s -> 12088.98s]  All right, manager's desk. Need a key
[12088.98s -> 12108.12s]  card.
[12108.12s -> 12111.00s]  Tuesday. Schedule meeting with Adam in
[12111.00s -> 12113.10s]  HR for that.
[12113.10s -> 12115.26s]  The stupid worker who left her key
[12115.26s -> 12116.94s]  card in plain sight in the yellow
[12116.94s -> 12118.46s]  section.
[12118.46s -> 12124.74s]  Stupid worker who left her
[12124.74s -> 12126.58s]  key card in plain sight in the
[12126.58s -> 12128.50s]  yellow section.
[12128.50s -> 12135.22s]  The yellow section. Is that orange?
[12135.22s -> 12140.52s]  We're gonna go to the yellow section.
[12140.60s -> 12153.24s]  Nobody in here?
[12153.24s -> 12157.46s]  Anomalous human.
[12157.46s -> 12166.89s]  That's blue. That's red. All right, I'm fine here.
[12166.89s -> 12168.49s]  Is that yellow down there maybe? I have no
[12168.49s -> 12175.03s]  idea.
[12175.03s -> 12178.28s]  Yellow's over here. That's yellow, right?
[12178.28s -> 12180.12s]  This is yellow. In plain sight in the
[12180.12s -> 12182.33s]  yellow section.
[12182.33s -> 12187.66s]  Can I get over there?
[12190.14s -> 12193.66s]  This is pretty yellow. HR. There it is.
[12193.66s -> 12197.99s]  HR. Yellow. What am I? I can stand
[12197.99s -> 12199.75s]  up. What am I doing?
[12199.75s -> 12202.17s]  I need the key card. Where's the yellow
[12202.17s -> 12208.98s]  section? Key card in plain sight.
[12208.98s -> 12232.98s]  Oh, it's already open. I don't always
[12232.98s -> 12239.64s]  let my guard down.
[12239.64s -> 12249.27s]  All right, what about over there? Right
[12249.27s -> 12253.35s]  down there?
[12253.35s -> 12260.01s]  Right into the desk. No, come on.
[12260.01s -> 12264.44s]  Better shot than that.
[12264.44s -> 12278.18s]  All right, I'm in. Did they come all
[12278.18s -> 12279.78s]  the way down here?
[12279.78s -> 12284.54s]  Doesn't look like it. All right, I'm
[12284.54s -> 12289.26s]  preparing a key card.
[12289.26s -> 12291.26s]  I've received a few notes about your
[12291.26s -> 12293.02s]  supervisors of late.
[12293.02s -> 12295.50s]  Please remember, any complaints will be
[12295.50s -> 12297.02s]  noted with Adam.
[12297.02s -> 12300.30s]  I heard of HR. He was always very keen
[12300.30s -> 12302.86s]  to know exactly who you are in
[12302.86s -> 12306.63s]  explicit detail.
[12306.63s -> 12315.40s]  Where's your key card?
[12315.40s -> 12333.10s]  That was the right idea. I was down
[12333.10s -> 12334.46s]  in the right spot.
[12334.46s -> 12338.12s]  I curled. You guys didn't. I don't think you saw it, but I curled up
[12338.12s -> 12342.02s]  into a fetal position.
[12342.02s -> 12346.10s]  I'm too immersed. Oh, thank god it just
[12346.10s -> 12347.22s]  puts me right here.
[12347.22s -> 12377.74s]  All right, let's go. Okay, there it is. Can I
[12377.74s -> 12380.28s]  scrap it through the portal?
[12380.28s -> 12381.72s]  Really? I can't just put my hand in
[12381.72s -> 12383.48s]  there? All right, wait till it's gone and
[12383.48s -> 12384.52s]  I'm going to come back and shoot it.
[12384.52s -> 12389.53s]  Ready? Here we go. One, two, three, go.
[12389.53s -> 12392.01s]  Oh, what are these cookies?
[12392.01s -> 12395.05s]  Please hold the text. What?
[12395.05s -> 12397.05s]  I've received a few notes about your
[12397.05s -> 12398.81s]  supervisors of late.
[12398.81s -> 12401.29s]  Please remember, any complaints will be
[12401.29s -> 12404.41s]  noted with Aria.
[12404.41s -> 12407.67s]  This very keen to know exactly who you
[12407.67s -> 12410.23s]  are.
[12410.23s -> 12417.10s]  Okay, I got it. I've never made that
[12417.10s -> 12428.50s]  kind of noise before.
[12428.50s -> 12430.74s]  A cartoon bird. All right, let's get out
[12430.74s -> 12439.83s]  of here.
[12439.83s -> 12463.86s]  Hey! What does this say?
[12463.86s -> 12467.46s]  Placeholder text for a lazy dev.
[12467.46s -> 12469.14s]  Forgot to replace the proper text
[12469.14s -> 12472.66s]  ring thingy. So you suck, whiz,
[12472.66s -> 12475.54s]  dev. Wow, it takes effort to write
[12475.54s -> 12476.74s]  more than a couple words for some
[12476.74s -> 12478.10s]  reason. I just wanted to fill
[12478.10s -> 12480.18s]  an A4 like, you know, with things. I
[12480.18s -> 12482.98s]  don't know. This is enough.
[12485.85s -> 12495.38s]  All right, I got the key card. We need to go to acquisitions.
[12495.38s -> 12501.53s]  Store that one. What? Oh, did I beat
[12501.53s -> 12505.85s]  the mission?
[12505.85s -> 12515.51s]  Pretty good. Why is this not fucking
[12515.51s -> 12520.71s]  Beat Saber? You know what I'm saying, kid?
[12520.71s -> 12523.40s]  Why is that? I don't have Beat Saber, kid.
[12523.40s -> 12538.82s]  All right, now where for? Interesting.
[12538.82s -> 12542.26s]  Welcome, everything's fine. This is a
[12542.26s -> 12546.17s]  very orange room. That's one single
[12546.17s -> 12547.83s]  orange.
[12547.83s -> 12559.11s]  Just give me a single orange, man.
[12559.11s -> 12561.62s]  Cool. All right, we got acquisitions,
[12561.62s -> 12563.22s]  distribution, cybernetics, public work,
[12563.22s -> 12564.58s]  statistics,
[12564.58s -> 12565.94s]  which is in here. So we need to go
[12565.94s -> 12567.46s]  to acquisitions.
[12567.46s -> 12581.85s]  This card doesn't work.
[12581.85s -> 12590.26s]  Okay, uh, right, right.
[12590.26s -> 12607.85s]  Uh, so how do I get up there?
[12613.37s -> 12616.10s]  Come on, Georgie. Come on down here,
[12616.10s -> 12619.30s]  Georgie.
[12619.30s -> 12632.17s]  I'm gonna bite your eyeball, kid.
[12632.17s -> 12638.04s]  Whoa, almost fell down. Attention. What
[12638.04s -> 12639.56s]  does it say? Attention.
[12639.56s -> 12641.80s]  Ventilation shafts ahead. This ventilation
[12641.80s -> 12644.20s]  connected to acquisitions,
[12644.20s -> 12645.64s]  distributions, lost and found, and
[12645.64s -> 12647.40s]  restaurants, okay?
[12647.40s -> 12649.48s]  So this ventilation connected to
[12649.48s -> 12654.18s]  acquisitions.
[12654.18s -> 12662.31s]  Okay, where's the vent? Oh, that's a vent.
[12662.31s -> 12668.02s]  Well, we'll just, let's go. Nothing else
[12668.02s -> 12671.05s]  I can do. Just go in here.
[12671.05s -> 12674.17s]  All right, we got fork, knife,
[12674.17s -> 12680.44s]  area to go, uh, the gas can of some
[12680.44s -> 12681.24s]  sort.
[12681.24s -> 12683.46s]  What do you want the gas can, you
[12683.46s -> 12685.78s]  think? Probably gonna need it down
[12685.78s -> 12689.14s]  there.
[12689.14s -> 12695.11s]  One, two, three.
[12695.11s -> 12708.84s]  That didn't do anything. Okay,
[12708.84s -> 12714.73s]  what else we got? Okay, go across
[12714.73s -> 12715.37s]  there.
[12715.37s -> 12719.91s]  Let's just do it.
[12720.47s -> 12726.47s]  Is this death? Yeah. All right, let's
[12726.47s -> 12727.67s]  sneak through. I'm gonna get jumpscared in
[12727.67s -> 12739.46s]  here or something, aren't I?
[12739.46s -> 12751.59s]  Okay, I can stand up now. Interesting.
[12751.59s -> 12753.43s]  We're gonna go that way.
[12753.43s -> 12764.47s]  It's not in. It is. Ah!
[12764.47s -> 12766.23s]  Well, this seems to be a dead end. No,
[12766.23s -> 12767.67s]  it's not.
[12767.67s -> 12781.10s]  There's no animals in here. The brush
[12781.10s -> 12784.55s]  is mightier than the sword. That's
[12784.55s -> 12800.15s]  what they're describing, okay?
[12800.23s -> 12803.38s]  That exploded. That thing was already
[12803.38s -> 12804.58s]  ready to blow up.
[12804.58s -> 12810.44s]  Nothing else I can do in here. Let's just keep moving.
[12810.44s -> 12819.58s]  Hey there, Georgie! Can you guys even
[12819.58s -> 12821.10s]  fucking see me right now?
[12821.10s -> 12831.40s]  I might feel like on camera. Button,
[12831.40s -> 12836.50s]  what do these do? I don't know if they do
[12836.50s -> 12855.16s]  anything. I have to do something with this.
[12855.16s -> 12861.80s]  Oh, hello. Bathroom, we made it.
[12861.80s -> 12876.47s]  Wow, you have an appearance. Whoa,
[12876.47s -> 12880.33s]  Twitter.
[12880.33s -> 12881.77s]  Ah, soap. I gotta play with the soap,
[12881.77s -> 12883.29s]  Spencer. I mean, it's a VR game. You
[12883.29s -> 12885.29s]  gotta click on everything, right?
[12885.29s -> 12886.98s]  You didn't program soap to come out
[12886.98s -> 12888.02s]  of the soap, Spencer. What are you
[12888.02s -> 12889.70s]  fucking kidding me?
[12889.70s -> 12902.04s]  Let's go in trash. Anybody in here?
[12902.04s -> 12911.00s]  All right, well, let's get in.
[12911.00s -> 12925.72s]  Oh, don't mind me. I'm just in the
[12925.72s -> 12926.68s]  bathroom.
[12926.68s -> 12931.32s]  All right, let's fucking get it down
[12931.32s -> 12934.10s]  here.
[12934.10s -> 12936.34s]  All right, I'm fucking ready. You ready?
[12936.34s -> 12937.86s]  Ah!
[12937.86s -> 12958.46s]  I gotta get out of the bathroom. All right, let me get out of the bathroom.
[12958.46s -> 12963.82s]  It's just like the other one. Need some
[12963.82s -> 12970.76s]  TP? Sure, I'll get it for you.
[12970.76s -> 12974.90s]  I gotta get out of this. I gotta...
[12982.71s -> 12985.54s]  All right, no fucking... Is there a wall?
[12985.54s -> 12988.62s]  There's a wall coming up.
[12988.62s -> 13006.86s]  Oh, I don't know where I am in the room.
[13006.86s -> 13008.86s]  I was slamming that on my knee. It was
[13008.86s -> 13010.46s]  like right on my knee. My knee was
[13010.46s -> 13011.10s]  right there.
[13011.10s -> 13019.35s]  It hurt. The stall's open out
[13019.35s -> 13020.47s]  this way.
[13020.47s -> 13033.94s]  There's gonna be a guy in here,
[13033.94s -> 13036.02s]  right? He's gonna be like, oh,
[13036.02s -> 13041.64s]  excuse me, right?
[13041.64s -> 13045.56s]  No, nobody in here. Nobody even in
[13045.56s -> 13046.36s]  the bathroom.
[13046.36s -> 13049.59s]  Oh, what am I gonna do about my fucking
[13049.59s -> 13066.47s]  alcohol moments?
[13066.47s -> 13071.70s]  All right, I gotta get out of the bathroom before I do something that I'm
[13071.70s -> 13072.82s]  gonna get in trouble for.
[13072.82s -> 13075.22s]  Get me out of the bathroom now. I don't
[13075.22s -> 13076.42s]  care about an item. Get me out.
[13076.42s -> 13079.46s]  Leave. Bathroom. Now. Bathroom. Out.
[13079.46s -> 13090.84s]  ...meditations. You know, they used to hear me talk and think I was as good as a player.
[13090.84s -> 13092.52s]  Lost and found again.
[13092.52s -> 13095.80s]  But look at me now. Am I on tech empire?
[13095.80s -> 13097.80s]  Reading you this motivational note in my
[13097.80s -> 13098.92s]  favorite hand.
[13098.92s -> 13101.56s]  So remember, we all in the same boat.
[13101.56s -> 13102.36s]  75.
[13102.36s -> 13106.76s]  That is probably bigger and more expensive.
[13106.76s -> 13109.32s]  So what is our objective right now?
[13110.31s -> 13111.43s]  Something, right?
[13111.43s -> 13117.38s]  Home sweet office.
[13117.38s -> 13117.86s]  Hey!
[13117.86s -> 13119.94s]  Oh, the microphone doesn't work.
[13119.94s -> 13121.78s]  Can I be back? Can I get back here?
[13121.78s -> 13124.95s]  Well, I guess I can get back here.
[13124.95s -> 13127.99s]  Fucking secret. You guys didn't think I was gonna get fucked secret.
[13127.99s -> 13129.91s]  The early bird.
[13129.91s -> 13134.33s]  Look at this shit.
[13134.33s -> 13136.33s]  What's going on on my shelf?
[13144.30s -> 13145.42s]  Nah, I need something heavier.
[13145.42s -> 13147.98s]  Oh, excuse you.
[13147.98s -> 13152.15s]  Oh, whoopsie.
[13152.15s -> 13155.53s]  Okay, box.
[13155.53s -> 13160.82s]  This one needs a level one security code. I have that.
[13160.82s -> 13169.91s]  Give it a swipe.
[13169.91s -> 13171.21s]  What happened?
[13171.21s -> 13176.92s]  Oh, five, seven, and eleven.
[13176.92s -> 13178.92s]  Five, seven, one, one.
[13178.92s -> 13179.80s]  Hello?
[13179.80s -> 13180.76s]  Yeah?
[13180.76s -> 13185.16s]  I'm not sure if this line is tapped, so there's a package of
[13185.16s -> 13189.00s]  letterers waiting for you in the distributions department.
[13189.00s -> 13193.16s]  They're shiny, sharp, and stabby letter openers
[13193.16s -> 13195.08s]  that will definitely help you to escape.
[13195.16s -> 13195.96s]  Distribution center.
[13195.96s -> 13202.18s]  Let's just say that a manifest that said safe, totally harmless, and another manifest that said
[13202.18s -> 13204.98s]  sharp, pointy knives magically got switched around.
[13207.35s -> 13208.47s]  That's hilarious.
[13208.47s -> 13210.87s]  All right, I mailed you a box in the distribution center,
[13211.67s -> 13213.90s]  which is over here.
[13213.90s -> 13214.38s]  Here we go.
[13216.78s -> 13218.38s]  Should I like do more like VR?
[13219.10s -> 13221.82s]  Should I get like really into it and like have you guys see like for instance like,
[13222.94s -> 13224.17s]  it's pretty cool, right?
[13224.17s -> 13227.46s]  Like, it's actually got weight to it.
[13229.45s -> 13230.49s]  Would more viewers be here?
[13232.62s -> 13233.66s]  Might be looking in the right direction.
[13236.23s -> 13237.91s]  All right, distribution center.
[13237.91s -> 13240.09s]  The brush is money than the sword.
[13240.09s -> 13241.05s]  You've seen this already.
[13241.77s -> 13247.90s]  Can't do anything with this.
[13248.62s -> 13249.58s]  Can't do anything with this.
[13251.72s -> 13253.88s]  This is fucking daffy ducks.
[13253.88s -> 13255.24s]  Like three nephews or whatever they are.
[13256.28s -> 13258.20s]  Tweedle-lee, Tweedle-dum, and Tweedle-doo.
[13259.64s -> 13260.14s]  Fuck them.
[13261.24s -> 13261.74s]  All right.
[13265.74s -> 13266.38s]  There's nothing in here.
[13266.38s -> 13267.50s]  Wait, there might be an Easter egg writer.
[13271.35s -> 13271.85s]  No.
[13283.37s -> 13284.95s]  No, nothing in here.
[13284.95s -> 13285.51s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13285.51s -> 13286.01s]  What's that?
[13287.27s -> 13296.87s]  All right, distribution center is over here.
[13296.87s -> 13298.63s]  That's Joan T.C.'s office.
[13302.50s -> 13304.50s]  There's Nikki Hortense.
[13305.22s -> 13307.50s]  But that's not, I don't think going,
[13307.50s -> 13309.82s]  do I have to go into everybody's office and see what they have on the desk?
[13315.62s -> 13316.50s]  Wait, there's a no here.
[13321.46s -> 13322.26s]  Oh my goodness.
[13323.78s -> 13327.78s]  I, dear Nikki, I hope that your travels have brought you new perspective.
[13328.74s -> 13330.42s]  This is too, I can't read it.
[13330.42s -> 13331.62s]  Look, here, just take a screenshot.
[13331.62s -> 13332.12s]  Ready?
[13332.82s -> 13335.46s]  Take a screen cap and then you can read it later.
[13336.18s -> 13345.19s]  All right, let's go.
[13353.56s -> 13355.48s]  Distributions, continue.
[13356.98s -> 13357.48s]  Hello.
[13371.24s -> 13373.94s]  I'm just a bully.
[13375.30s -> 13377.26s]  All right, you need that notebook?
[13378.62s -> 13379.66s]  I just did the magic trick.
[13383.51s -> 13384.47s]  Would that take that?
[13385.35s -> 13387.46s]  Oh no, it's not coming in here.
[13387.46s -> 13388.50s]  Not gonna, no, no, we're good, we're good.
[13391.78s -> 13393.70s]  Two big cans of soda you got here
[13396.41s -> 13399.61s]  that transforms who is Dr. Gimbal Locke.
[13404.66s -> 13405.16s]  Cool.
[13405.94s -> 13410.78s]  All right, this is a secure area.
[13411.58s -> 13414.22s]  Level one key, I got that shit right here.
[13414.86s -> 13416.14s]  Distributions is this way.
[13416.94s -> 13425.56s]  Whoa, he opened the door.
[13432.44s -> 13433.48s]  Holy fuck, man.
[13434.52s -> 13441.11s]  Oh my god, he's gonna shoot me with the gun.
[13441.11s -> 13443.43s]  I thought, yeah, I didn't know he opened the doors.
[13444.07s -> 13450.38s]  So you guys are that way, right?
[13450.38s -> 13451.70s]  We're not.
[13451.70s -> 13453.54s]  You guys are over here?
[13454.65s -> 13456.89s]  No, you guys are this way.
[13457.45s -> 13459.82s]  Hey guys, how are you?
[13460.54s -> 13467.38s]  I wonder what that other thing is for.
[13471.67s -> 13475.27s]  It's in the door.
[13482.71s -> 13484.81s]  Okay, we need to go.
[13485.85s -> 13489.70s]  Right, that doesn't look right at all.
[13490.42s -> 13490.98s]  Where am I?
[13493.40s -> 13495.08s]  What year is it right now?
[13495.08s -> 13497.40s]  57, do I have to call the number again?
[13498.28s -> 13499.32s]  I have to call the number again.
[13508.44s -> 13512.97s]  Oh boy, we're getting some problems here.
[13515.53s -> 13516.65s]  Okay, I'm gonna open these all.
[13516.65s -> 13517.45s]  These are all open, right?
[13517.45s -> 13519.45s]  Get them all open, keep them open
[13520.01s -> 13521.21s]  because they're escape pods.
[13521.93s -> 13523.29s]  They're wasting me to get the hell out of here.
[13525.29s -> 13528.12s]  All right.
[13532.17s -> 13533.45s]  When you feel down, look up.
[13535.69s -> 13541.30s]  Can I not do anything about that?
[13548.70s -> 13550.22s]  All right, let's just get back out here.
[13550.22s -> 13551.66s]  Distribution center, give me that key.
[13555.14s -> 13555.86s]  Get out of the way.
[13596.71s -> 13604.68s]  What is this?
[13605.32s -> 13608.33s]  Did I save this?
[13608.97s -> 13611.37s]  The office, dear friend at the office,
[13611.37s -> 13613.45s]  I'm very happy to be live here on my vacation.
[13613.45s -> 13614.33s]  Please don't look for me.
[13615.13s -> 13616.49s]  Desk 132B.
[13617.53s -> 13653.90s]  He doesn't come down here, does he?
[13658.17s -> 13658.97s]  Does he come in here?
[13688.18s -> 13688.50s]  Shit.
[13692.55s -> 13693.11s]  Distribution.
[13696.18s -> 13696.82s]  All right, I made it.
[13700.09s -> 13700.89s]  Look at the knives.
[13701.77s -> 13702.49s]  Letter openers.
[13705.74s -> 13707.02s]  Hey, excuse me.
[13707.74s -> 13710.30s]  Okay, unbox pens, call mom, smile.
[13711.10s -> 13712.79s]  All right, what is it?
[13712.79s -> 13713.19s]  Up here?
[13714.46s -> 13714.78s]  There?
[13721.99s -> 13723.27s]  1598.
[13723.83s -> 13728.82s]  There's only two?
[13730.50s -> 13731.32s]  How do they work?
[13737.18s -> 13738.14s]  I'm not even holding it right.
[13740.95s -> 13743.27s]  Okay, why do you have like three microwaves up here?
[13744.15s -> 13745.03s]  What is it?
[13745.03s -> 13745.99s]  1598.
[13760.82s -> 13767.13s]  Seems a bit ominous.
[13767.13s -> 13767.77s]  Cybernetics.
[13769.29s -> 13769.77s]  Good luck.
[13771.27s -> 13773.51s]  You and then I have to go to cybernetics.
[13773.51s -> 13774.71s]  Oh, god damn it.
[13774.71s -> 13775.51s]  What did I hit?
[13775.51s -> 13776.31s]  The fucking wall.
[13781.86s -> 13782.74s]  Cybernetics.
[13783.86s -> 13786.50s]  Watch out, okay?
[13787.38s -> 13789.30s]  I'm taking a break.
[13790.10s -> 13797.53s]  I need to locate caffeinated beverage.
[13800.42s -> 13800.90s]  Hello.
[13801.94s -> 13802.98s]  I'm trying to put the head on you,
[13802.98s -> 13804.74s]  like in Skyrim and then steal from me, right?
[13804.74s -> 13806.02s]  That scared me.
[13806.02s -> 13806.34s]  Sorry.
[13807.54s -> 13808.76s]  All right, cybernetics.
[13808.76s -> 13809.24s]  Let's go.
[13810.04s -> 13811.54s]  Well, actually, hold on.
[13811.54s -> 13812.02s]  What's in here?
[13813.70s -> 13817.67s]  Any more letter openers in here?
[13817.67s -> 13818.87s]  That I need to be made aware of?
[13822.09s -> 13827.27s]  What key is that?
[13828.15s -> 13828.71s]  Just locked.
[13829.43s -> 13833.22s]  Got a phone in here though.
[13833.78s -> 13836.09s]  No, same 1598.
[13836.09s -> 13836.81s]  Come on, I need some more.
[13836.81s -> 13837.45s]  Any more letters?
[13844.76s -> 13845.64s]  Not that I can see.
[13845.64s -> 13847.00s]  Let's just go to cybernetics.
[13850.89s -> 13852.49s]  All right, here we go.
[13864.26s -> 13866.07s]  Can I not open this door?
[13870.57s -> 13876.90s]  Uh, I guess we're going over here.
[13878.18s -> 13880.78s]  Well, found them.
[13881.66s -> 13887.45s]  How many knives am I going to need?
[13893.69s -> 13894.17s]  Nice.
[13894.17s -> 13896.95s]  Okay, well, I kind of need all these.
[13900.09s -> 13900.41s]  Wait.
[13903.90s -> 13918.44s]  Oh, shut up.
[13918.44s -> 13919.96s]  All right, so yeah, you can throw the knives.
[13924.73s -> 13926.81s]  The knives actually have weight to them when they move.
[13926.81s -> 13927.05s]  Cool.
[13929.62s -> 13930.26s]  Let me try.
[13944.41s -> 13945.21s]  Cybernetics.
[13945.21s -> 13946.89s]  Let's make our way over there, what do you say?
[13951.24s -> 13951.72s]  Watch out.
[13951.72s -> 13952.44s]  This is one, right?
[13952.44s -> 13953.24s]  Give me that key card.
[13953.72s -> 13957.30s]  You got scissors.
[13957.30s -> 13959.82s]  Can I throw the scissors at somebody?
[13960.86s -> 13961.82s]  I have to be able to, right?
[13961.82s -> 13963.34s]  Like fucking gouge somebody's eyes out.
[13964.46s -> 13966.86s]  I thought that was the actual wall and it scared the fuck out of me.
[13967.98s -> 13969.02s]  I can't take these.
[13969.02s -> 13970.25s]  I'm just going to walk around with them.
[13971.05s -> 13971.85s]  Anything outside?
[13982.02s -> 13983.22s]  No, just keep going.
[13985.43s -> 13986.55s]  I hear somebody moving around.
[13990.50s -> 13997.18s]  There we go, okay.
[14007.11s -> 14008.31s]  There is somebody in here.
[14010.12s -> 14011.32s]  One of those bad guys.
[14012.54s -> 14013.58s]  Uh,
[14014.81s -> 14015.13s]  uh,
[14017.32s -> 14019.56s]  can I throw this at him and hit him in the face and knock him out?
[14020.60s -> 14024.79s]  All right, I'm going back to the first area.
[14025.67s -> 14027.98s]  I'm so confused right now.
[14027.98s -> 14028.30s]  Hold on.
[14028.94s -> 14030.22s]  This is the first area, isn't it?
[14030.94s -> 14033.64s]  I made it back to the first place.
[14046.58s -> 14047.38s]  What the hell happened?
[14048.98s -> 14049.38s]  Did I?
[14049.38s -> 14058.76s]  Did I do it?
[14059.64s -> 14063.03s]  What am I going?
[14068.20s -> 14078.38s]  Okay, I'm still going.
[14079.26s -> 14081.42s]  Okay, there are more knives here.
[14082.38s -> 14086.04s]  I gotta try to throw a knife at somebody, right?
[14087.80s -> 14100.78s]  I gotta hit this guy tonight.
[14101.50s -> 14105.21s]  What's that?
[14105.21s -> 14105.85s]  There's a wall here.
[14106.49s -> 14108.50s]  Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[14108.50s -> 14109.30s]  There's a wall right there.
[14118.84s -> 14123.48s]  What the fuck is going on down there?
[14135.64s -> 14136.28s]  Wait for him.
[14136.28s -> 14136.84s]  Wait for him.
[14138.04s -> 14138.68s]  Wait for him.
[14166.94s -> 14167.98s]  Hey, thanks buddy.
[14169.24s -> 14170.44s]  I owe you one.
[14170.44s -> 14202.20s]  No, turn the lights off.
[14202.52s -> 14218.66s]  Oh, you hit me right in the face.
[14233.54s -> 14234.98s]  That was a chimpanzee.
[14236.02s -> 14238.15s]  Should have used knives more often.
[14238.15s -> 14244.12s]  Yeah, how's the coal?
[14252.10s -> 14253.06s]  Splinter cell.
[14255.90s -> 14258.46s]  How was your latest session?
[14258.46s -> 14259.34s]  I was pretty sick.
[14260.22s -> 14266.82s]  Not as bad?
[14266.82s -> 14269.78s]  No, I must have acid sweated through the whole thing.
[14273.72s -> 14275.00s]  Angle the camera down.
[14275.00s -> 14278.36s]  What's it when I go like this and I'm like sneaking down?
[14279.08s -> 14281.88s]  If I angle the camera down, then you won't be able to see me when I'm like back here
[14281.88s -> 14283.56s]  or like over here or moving around here.
[14286.31s -> 14287.66s]  All right, I'm gonna give it another tap.
[14287.66s -> 14290.22s]  We're gonna go one more time and then I gotta take a break.
[14291.10s -> 14292.44s]  This is fucking fun though.
[14293.67s -> 14294.95s]  What a blast.
[14294.95s -> 14296.23s]  Virtual reality.
[14297.03s -> 14300.20s]  Turn the webcam sideways.
[14300.20s -> 14301.24s]  I can't like mount it.
[14307.30s -> 14308.10s]  All right, let's do it again.
[14308.10s -> 14308.74s]  One more time.
[14308.74s -> 14310.82s]  Let's see if I can get to at least the end of this little section here.
[14310.82s -> 14313.54s]  There's so much hair is bunching up and it's being ripped out.
[14314.26s -> 14314.74s]  Look at this.
[14315.94s -> 14319.78s]  Okay, remember those infomercials where it was the vacuum that cut your hair?
[14320.95s -> 14322.47s]  If I pull this up, it's all coming out.
[14338.79s -> 14340.07s]  Hey, how's everybody doing?
[14340.07s -> 14341.11s]  How are you?
[14341.11s -> 14342.79s]  Yeah, it's been rough, but it's all right.
[14342.79s -> 14343.35s]  I'm doing all right.
[14343.35s -> 14343.83s]  I'm doing good.
[14344.73s -> 14345.37s]  How are you doing?
[14345.37s -> 14346.09s]  How's everything going?
[14346.09s -> 14346.65s]  How are the kids?
[14348.28s -> 14351.48s]  Yeah, I'm like the guy that screens the people under the bridge now.
[14351.48s -> 14352.36s]  You know, that's what I do.
[14353.00s -> 14355.40s]  It's been real, you know, just get the job done.
[14356.49s -> 14356.97s]  Ow.
[14356.97s -> 14377.06s]  I'm gonna have to take a hose to this.
[14385.30s -> 14387.70s]  My poor hair was already struggling.
[14388.26s -> 14389.22s]  It's just gonna come out.
[14389.86s -> 14392.50s]  All right, let me get like a little sip of this, uh, just drink
[14392.50s -> 14393.54s]  and we'll try it one more time.
[14397.16s -> 14398.52s]  He thinks he's streaming.
[14405.75s -> 14410.14s]  So I see that there have been barely any drop frames in about
[14410.86s -> 14411.26s]  four hours.
[14411.26s -> 14412.30s]  So that's, that's a good sign.
[14418.33s -> 14419.77s]  He's been a patient.
[14419.77s -> 14422.09s]  Thinks he's in a stream in VR.
[14422.97s -> 14431.53s]  I need to get like a beanie or a goddamn haircut would do too.
[14432.17s -> 14440.07s]  All right, let's get back in.
[14440.07s -> 14443.82s]  I'll do one more death or one more attempt.
[14453.94s -> 14458.33s]  So tomorrow there's more.
[14459.21s -> 14462.90s]  I gotta think of a situation to untangle this fucking cord.
[14463.94s -> 14469.56s]  I'm gonna have to figure out a solution.
[14470.28s -> 14471.77s]  Is this left or right?
[14476.07s -> 14480.94s]  Okay, this one is left.
[14483.02s -> 14484.70s]  I expect you to die.
[14487.10s -> 14489.67s]  Well, I expect you to die.
[14490.55s -> 14493.03s]  It's not, it's the wrong game.
[14493.59s -> 14499.16s]  What's happening here?
[14501.56s -> 14502.04s]  Oh, right.
[14506.18s -> 14509.19s]  One, two, don't touch that one.
[14509.83s -> 14518.17s]  So the object, I might have it all the way back.
[14518.17s -> 14519.77s]  No, I have to be like a checkpoint or something, right?
[14520.57s -> 14523.08s]  No, this is perfect.
[14523.08s -> 14524.04s]  All right, I'm in a good spot.
[14525.42s -> 14528.66s]  I have, let's knife this motherfucker.
[14530.46s -> 14532.14s]  I'm not even gonna be scared about this.
[14532.78s -> 14533.66s]  Do you think I'm scared?
[14538.47s -> 14539.83s]  What are you gonna do about that one?
[14554.95s -> 14556.71s]  He's just like pissing over here.
[14557.03s -> 14557.67s]  No, that doesn't count.
[14557.67s -> 14558.55s]  That didn't count.
[14558.55s -> 14559.19s]  That didn't count.
[14563.26s -> 14564.70s]  He was just letting it ride over here.
[14574.74s -> 14575.46s]  Okay, we're back in.
[14576.26s -> 14577.46s]  Do it again.
[14585.02s -> 14586.22s]  I gotta hit him right in the face.
[14590.63s -> 14591.43s]  Right in the face.
[14596.54s -> 14602.72s]  Do it again.
[14606.47s -> 14608.15s]  I'll do another, I'll throw a second one.
[14618.44s -> 14620.74s]  Please wait, please wait.
[14639.40s -> 14640.28s]  Give me that knife back.
[14644.68s -> 14645.18s]  What?
[14645.24s -> 14645.74s]  Oh.
[14647.08s -> 14647.58s]  Okay.
[14648.20s -> 14649.08s]  I'm making it through.
[14667.13s -> 14668.49s]  I didn't get fucking caught here.
[14674.78s -> 14676.06s]  Where's the wall?
[14676.14s -> 14677.58s]  Make sure I'm not touching a fucking wall.
[14680.81s -> 14682.60s]  Why did I just kill that?
[14682.60s -> 14683.88s]  Why did I do that to that guy?
[14684.68s -> 14724.12s]  This one's gotta count.
[14731.35s -> 14737.61s]  I'm freezing.
[14740.33s -> 14741.85s]  No, why did I do that?
[14741.85s -> 14746.07s]  He could have talked.
[14746.07s -> 14747.11s]  Okay, he could have talked.
[14747.83s -> 14768.49s]  One, five, nine, eight.
[14768.49s -> 14769.13s]  No, not yet.
[14778.90s -> 14780.74s]  That's two, I need two little two.
[14783.03s -> 14784.79s]  Work hard, get one access.
[14785.67s -> 14786.95s]  Everybody have like a key card over here?
[14788.95s -> 14794.17s]  Can I get in that?
[14794.17s -> 14795.53s]  No, I can't get in the production thing.
[14802.31s -> 14802.81s]  Stop that.
[14803.51s -> 14806.65s]  Maybe go back up?
[14807.61s -> 14808.89s]  Let me just check some desks.
[14809.69s -> 14819.08s]  If you go in here.
[14835.48s -> 14843.42s]  I guess I'm gonna go back up.
[14845.40s -> 14854.60s]  Was I back here yet?
[14855.48s -> 14857.30s]  I don't think I was back here yet.
[14858.26s -> 14860.78s]  Somebody's desk?
[14860.78s -> 14861.90s]  Anybody got level two in here?
[14863.42s -> 14866.46s]  Oh, that's where you find the money.
[14873.34s -> 14874.22s]  Beautiful.
[14874.22s -> 14875.42s]  Level two.
[14875.42s -> 14882.95s]  I'm gonna go for like a bouncing shot here.
[14884.30s -> 14885.10s]  Just like that.
[14885.10s -> 14886.06s]  All right, back down.
[14886.06s -> 14887.02s]  Where is it? Over here, right?
[14887.98s -> 14892.66s]  I'll get that later.
[14893.38s -> 14894.68s]  Level two.
[14895.24s -> 14899.05s]  Is there a wall?
[14899.05s -> 14899.53s]  Yeah, there is.
[14899.53s -> 14899.93s]  Be careful.
[14900.73s -> 14902.12s]  All right.
[14911.16s -> 14921.59s]  Gotta be prepared for this shit.
[14921.59s -> 14922.55s]  I'm almost out of this.
[14928.94s -> 14938.02s]  You can see me through the portal.
[14965.30s -> 14965.86s]  Fuck you!
[14979.42s -> 14981.40s]  Oh no, he's alive?
[14982.76s -> 15009.48s]  That it?
[15010.67s -> 15014.99s]  I don't mind if I do.
[15016.89s -> 15023.58s]  That was just fucking mean.
[15027.10s -> 15027.60s]  Hey!
[15035.74s -> 15040.40s]  Don't kill them.
[15040.40s -> 15042.80s]  Just put them up.
[15042.80s -> 15043.52s]  I'm gonna need these.
[15044.16s -> 15045.12s]  I'm gonna need these later.
[15051.44s -> 15053.12s]  Meeting room bull.
[15054.46s -> 15055.34s]  Meeting room bull.
[15057.36s -> 15058.08s]  Something going on?
[15058.08s -> 15059.20s]  Is something happening here?
[15059.20s -> 15059.76s]  Hang in there.
[15063.60s -> 15067.23s]  Well, that sure is them.
[15069.45s -> 15070.73s]  We may need to move out of the way.
[15071.53s -> 15072.41s]  All right, so what we got?
[15073.21s -> 15081.00s]  We went through the front door.
[15119.42s -> 15120.30s]  Oh, come on!
[15120.86s -> 15135.44s]  I was trying to be so careful, too.
[15135.44s -> 15136.00s]  Where's the knives?
[15136.00s -> 15136.56s]  I just put them on.
[15136.56s -> 15138.24s]  It feels like a good day for a good day.
[15139.12s -> 15146.68s]  Should I go on over?
[15146.68s -> 15147.32s]  No, I don't.
[15147.32s -> 15150.00s]  I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[15150.00s -> 15155.64s]  I'm gonna hit that one over there
[15155.64s -> 15156.76s]  a shitload of times.
[15157.40s -> 15160.52s]  I need like a better solution to that.
[15160.52s -> 15162.36s]  I'm gonna have to move my lighthouses, I think.
[15163.00s -> 15164.68s]  Because I'm gonna fucking break that thing.
[15166.28s -> 15171.92s]  Okay, here we go.
[15172.64s -> 15180.80s]  Electricity, electricity, electricity.
[15180.80s -> 15181.36s]  What's in here?
[15185.69s -> 15187.40s]  Uh, huh.
[15189.44s -> 15190.00s]  Well, shit.
[15190.48s -> 15190.72s]  Hmm.
[15192.76s -> 15194.12s]  Maybe I have to go down this.
[15194.12s -> 15195.16s]  Should I go down here?
[15199.90s -> 15200.78s]  I'm just gonna go down here.
[15201.58s -> 15201.98s]  Fuck it.
[15208.40s -> 15209.60s]  Two, three, thirty.
[15210.32s -> 15212.06s]  The phone's ringing.
[15219.26s -> 15220.08s]  Really?
[15226.72s -> 15227.84s]  In the dog dog.
[15227.84s -> 15228.56s]  In the doggy door.
[15230.06s -> 15231.26s]  I made it in the doggy door, but.
[15232.54s -> 15233.26s]  Yeah, hello?
[15238.36s -> 15239.16s]  I admit it.
[15239.16s -> 15240.60s]  I knew this would happen.
[15240.60s -> 15244.44s]  I mean, you're holding a very valuable stolen prototype.
[15244.44s -> 15245.40s]  Mm-hmm, yeah.
[15245.40s -> 15246.28s]  Oh, don't get mad, okay?
[15246.28s -> 15248.52s]  I needed you to understand how bad things were here.
[15249.32s -> 15253.31s]  I need your help to find out what's going on.
[15254.03s -> 15255.63s]  Get a level three access card,
[15255.63s -> 15258.59s]  take the elevator, and find someone called April.
[15258.59s -> 15260.51s]  Her desk is in the production department.
[15260.51s -> 15263.55s]  Now, if you help me, I promise to help you escape.
[15263.55s -> 15264.51s]  Now, if you help me, I promise to help you escape.
[15264.51s -> 15265.31s]  Hank, you swear it.
[15270.28s -> 15271.96s]  Company to the pat-down station in the lobby.
[15272.04s -> 15274.68s]  Company will probably become a guest key in the lobby, whatever.
[15274.68s -> 15276.36s]  All right, so I gotta get a level three card,
[15276.36s -> 15277.88s]  and then I gotta go level fucking three,
[15277.88s -> 15279.64s]  and I gotta go level three, get a level three card,
[15279.64s -> 15280.52s]  and then get out of here.
[15280.52s -> 15281.80s]  Go and get out.
[15284.38s -> 15287.18s]  Sounds not easy enough,
[15287.18s -> 15289.90s]  but probably simple enough where it'll happen eventually.
[15289.90s -> 15290.54s]  What's over here?
[15291.82s -> 15293.45s]  It's locked.
[15294.09s -> 15294.49s]  That's it.
[15294.49s -> 15295.85s]  Okay, there's the elevator right there.
[15295.85s -> 15296.65s]  I need a level three card.
[15296.65s -> 15297.29s]  I gotta go in there.
[15317.47s -> 15322.49s]  What am I fucking running into?
[15327.93s -> 15328.73s]  There's a gun.
[15374.62s -> 15375.42s]  How do I use this?
[15376.38s -> 15401.12s]  Can I use this thing?
[15403.21s -> 15403.93s]  Can I use this?
[15424.48s -> 15428.43s]  All right, I got the card.
[15428.43s -> 15429.07s]  Let's go to the...
[15430.67s -> 15434.08s]  Let's get out of here.
[15434.08s -> 15434.64s]  Level three.
[15435.44s -> 15443.31s]  Let's go.
[15443.95s -> 15457.42s]  I did it.
[15457.42s -> 15457.82s]  I don't...
[15457.82s -> 15459.50s]  I only need the level three card.
[15459.50s -> 15471.26s]  It does everything the lower ones already do.
[15471.98s -> 15481.52s]  All right, let's go.
[15483.10s -> 15485.69s]  You've been in for too long.
[15485.69s -> 15486.41s]  No, no, I'm all right.
[15486.41s -> 15487.05s]  I'm going back in.
[15487.05s -> 15487.93s]  I'm going back in.
[15487.93s -> 15489.42s]  I'll be just fine.
[15489.42s -> 15489.98s]  Don't worry about me.
[15489.98s -> 15490.86s]  I'm gonna go back in.
[15490.86s -> 15494.76s]  Jeremy, you haven't shown up to work.
[15495.32s -> 15496.36s]  I'm going back in.
[15496.36s -> 15499.63s]  Jeremy, your school called.
[15499.63s -> 15500.19s]  That's all right.
[15500.19s -> 15505.18s]  I'm just gonna go back in for like another five minutes.
[15505.18s -> 15508.70s]  Jeremy, you haven't eaten in fucking two days.
[15508.70s -> 15509.18s]  That's all right.
[15509.18s -> 15509.98s]  I'm just gonna go back in.
[15514.30s -> 15514.62s]  Hey.
[15521.98s -> 15522.46s]  No number?
[15523.50s -> 15524.78s]  None of his company.
[15524.78s -> 15527.58s]  And he knows to work anywhere other than...
[15527.58s -> 15528.78s]  Oh, that hurt my head.
[15534.49s -> 15535.29s]  Can I use this?
[15535.29s -> 15535.69s]  Do I need to...
[15538.73s -> 15539.13s]  That way.
[15542.48s -> 15543.04s]  No.
[15543.04s -> 15543.84s]  8008.
[15543.84s -> 15544.72s]  Hello, you're listening.
[15544.72s -> 15546.80s]  I am very busy with my tax.
[15546.80s -> 15547.84s]  Backspot is broken.
[15547.84s -> 15549.76s]  Use John Smith's machine instead.
[15550.56s -> 15556.35s]  What the fuck is the number?
[15556.35s -> 15557.15s]  8008.
[15560.16s -> 15561.28s]  No, 8000.
[15563.72s -> 15587.60s]  I don't like this office.
[15587.60s -> 15588.96s]  I'm not coming into work tomorrow.
[15590.81s -> 15591.77s]  John Smith's office.
[15592.41s -> 15594.09s]  Let me in.
[15595.28s -> 15596.96s]  Map of pre-production department.
[15597.76s -> 15599.04s]  John Smith fax room.
[15599.04s -> 15599.68s]  Elevated lobby.
[15599.68s -> 15601.04s]  Mess hall production department.
[15601.04s -> 15602.00s]  Auxiliary.
[15602.56s -> 15603.04s]  John's.
[15604.40s -> 15605.74s]  Hello?
[15615.42s -> 15633.80s]  There's a wall.
[15633.80s -> 15634.36s]  Where's the wall?
[15667.63s -> 15671.23s]  Excuse me.
[15671.79s -> 15676.08s]  I need that back.
[15683.23s -> 15683.71s]  Uh-oh.
[15688.00s -> 15688.32s]  What?
[15688.32s -> 15688.80s]  Hey, what?
[15712.97s -> 15713.69s]  Who shot?
[15714.25s -> 15720.54s]  Who shot?
[15720.54s -> 15721.42s]  Is everybody behind me?
[15721.98s -> 15729.98s]  Who's behind me?
[15729.98s -> 15733.77s]  All right.
[15733.77s -> 15738.78s]  I think it's time to take a break.
[15738.78s -> 15739.58s]  Oh.
[15739.58s -> 15741.47s]  I'm having too much fun, but I gotta like...
[15741.47s -> 15742.75s]  I gotta like fucking rest my eyes.
[15748.41s -> 15748.97s]  Rage quit?
[15748.97s -> 15749.45s]  No, no.
[15749.93s -> 15751.77s]  I'll probably start with this tomorrow.
[15751.77s -> 15753.77s]  There's so many VR games though.
[15753.77s -> 15758.33s]  Oh, there's so many VR games that I have to play.
[15761.24s -> 15762.52s]  So we're gonna be tomorrow.
[15763.24s -> 15765.40s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow with more VR.
[15766.04s -> 15768.08s]  So we're gonna go three days in a row.
[15768.08s -> 15769.12s]  Just because I'm 1-0.
[15772.03s -> 15772.67s]  I mentioned like...
[15773.90s -> 15777.42s]  You can't even take me seriously with this like fucking toupee.
[15778.54s -> 15781.04s]  Oh my god.
[15781.04s -> 15782.56s]  Let's get a real talk going here, guys.
[15784.04s -> 15786.76s]  It's like this is a toupee they used to wear back in like the fucking...
[15787.48s -> 15788.68s]  It's 1800.
[15793.84s -> 15796.46s]  I gotta go get like food and just relax for a little bit.
[15796.46s -> 15797.42s]  It's like a couple hours.
[15797.98s -> 15801.34s]  I can only stay inside these things for like four to five hours
[15801.34s -> 15803.26s]  before like I gotta get away from it.
[15804.30s -> 15806.78s]  So tomorrow we're gonna pick up again.
[15807.50s -> 15810.41s]  We're gonna do more VR tomorrow.
[15813.56s -> 15817.96s]  So I will see you guys tomorrow
[15817.96s -> 15819.88s]  around three to four p.m. Pacific.
[15820.44s -> 15822.64s]  Get the camera out of here.
[15823.20s -> 15826.60s]  I doubt I could even go that long.
[15827.48s -> 15828.44s]  It really depends on the day.
[15829.16s -> 15832.49s]  Sometimes it's like one hour is enough for me to have to stop.
[15832.49s -> 15833.61s]  Sometimes like four to five.
[15836.12s -> 15837.08s]  It's still in the game.
[15837.08s -> 15838.44s]  Yeah, it saves it, right?
[15839.00s -> 15840.84s]  Don't have to do anything in particular to save the game.
[15847.36s -> 15848.16s]  That was a blast.
[15849.52s -> 15850.64s]  I'm very satisfied.
[15857.48s -> 15860.52s]  Kiwo can stream VR for like 13 hours straight.
[15860.52s -> 15861.40s]  Oh my god.
[15862.89s -> 15863.21s]  How?
[15864.24s -> 15865.36s]  How is it possible?
[15870.14s -> 15876.70s]  13 hours in the helmet?
[15876.70s -> 15880.12s]  Yeah, first impressions of Vibe is absolutely worth the money.
[15880.12s -> 15881.24s]  It was a blast.
[15881.24s -> 15884.94s]  I just I need to like take a few hours after that
[15884.94s -> 15886.62s]  and just kind of get my eyes off of it.
[15889.74s -> 15891.10s]  But tomorrow we're gonna pick up again.
[15892.12s -> 15893.00s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[15897.04s -> 15897.60s]  More VR.
[15897.60s -> 15898.72s]  I'm gonna get some more games.
[15898.72s -> 15900.64s]  I'm gonna get some Beat Saber stuff.
[15904.75s -> 15906.27s]  But I'm tapped out for now.
[15908.25s -> 15909.53s]  By the moving sea.
[15911.82s -> 15913.82s]  This Discord link.
[15913.82s -> 15915.42s]  This coal miner link.
[15918.43s -> 15923.34s]  That's so stupid.
[15927.56s -> 15928.68s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[15928.68s -> 15929.80s]  We got some bits to go through.
[15932.36s -> 15933.56s]  I'm gonna try a different...
[15933.56s -> 15934.92s]  I might move the lighthouses
[15934.92s -> 15936.36s]  because I don't want to break these things.
[15938.25s -> 15941.77s]  And I hit the lighthouse on the back portion of the room twice.
[15945.50s -> 15946.46s]  So see you tomorrow.
[15947.66s -> 15948.94s]  Let's get the outro on here.
[15948.94s -> 15949.98s]  Let's take that off.
[15950.62s -> 15953.39s]  Thank you for joining me.
[15955.85s -> 15957.93s]  What do you say we go down here?
[15958.49s -> 15965.93s]  Move as far as I can to the corner.
[15966.01s -> 15969.29s]  Yeah, the only problem is I have a big L-shaped desk.
[15971.20s -> 15972.08s]  And the desk is...
[15974.00s -> 15977.52s]  It kind of takes up a large portion of the back and left wall.
[15978.56s -> 15980.00s]  So trying to get the lighthouses...
[15980.00s -> 15982.40s]  I mean the room is big enough to do it.
[15982.40s -> 15984.32s]  And obviously I was taking at least
[15985.44s -> 15985.92s]  what?
[15985.92s -> 15988.40s]  Two or three steps in any given direction without hitting a wall.
[15992.36s -> 15993.40s]  Why do my knees hurt?
[15994.75s -> 15996.75s]  I have like red raw knees.
[15996.75s -> 15997.25s]  What?
[15998.04s -> 15998.54s]  Why?
[16005.07s -> 16006.11s]  Oh, it's from crawling around.
[16008.20s -> 16011.24s]  All right, so let's start a few...
[16011.24s -> 16012.76s]  Let's see, about four and a half hours ago.
[16013.64s -> 16016.68s]  We had a ton of gifted subs that came from Guild Hero.
[16016.68s -> 16018.36s]  I'm not sure if you still hear Guild Hero, but thank you.
[16019.16s -> 16022.28s]  There's like at least 25 to 30 gifted subs here.
[16022.28s -> 16022.84s]  Thanks a lot.
[16028.52s -> 16029.16s]  Yeah, I laid...
[16029.16s -> 16030.12s]  I did lie on the ground.
[16030.76s -> 16032.65s]  But thank you so much Guild Hero.
[16034.22s -> 16035.18s]  Let's start back here.
[16039.44s -> 16040.16s]  We had...
[16042.08s -> 16043.60s]  Hey Alec, thanks for the one dollar.
[16044.32s -> 16047.20s]  I got the starry night night sky shirt and it's epic.
[16048.68s -> 16050.20s]  Yeah, it's a great shirt.
[16050.20s -> 16051.00s]  I highly recommend it.
[16053.39s -> 16054.67s]  If you don't know what I'm talking about,
[16054.67s -> 16056.59s]  if you just have a teespring store,
[16057.23s -> 16058.27s]  a couple of shirts are there.
[16058.27s -> 16060.03s]  If you feel like buying them, cool.
[16061.15s -> 16062.27s]  They're very, very well made.
[16062.27s -> 16062.83s]  They're very...
[16062.83s -> 16063.95s]  The designs are very good.
[16065.12s -> 16065.92s]  It is available.
[16066.56s -> 16072.38s]  Wow, we just went to zero.
[16072.94s -> 16075.72s]  That was like a full-on zero.
[16076.52s -> 16078.38s]  Damn, okay.
[16078.38s -> 16080.30s]  Well, refresh, I guess.
[16080.30s -> 16080.86s]  That was weird.
[16082.75s -> 16084.27s]  But yeah, the shirts are available.
[16084.27s -> 16084.83s]  They're really cool.
[16085.71s -> 16087.68s]  I highly recommend them.
[16089.66s -> 16091.10s]  Thank you, sad Vega, for the one dollar.
[16091.10s -> 16093.98s]  So I did the idiot remark at Taco Bell while ordering food.
[16094.54s -> 16097.10s]  I said, I'll have a cheese Gordita Crunch, idiot.
[16097.10s -> 16098.62s]  They looked at me for a second in shock.
[16099.26s -> 16100.70s]  Then I repeated it and the manager came
[16100.70s -> 16103.42s]  and told me to apologize and leave or he'd call the police.
[16103.42s -> 16105.90s]  I apologized profusely and blamed you,
[16106.62s -> 16108.78s]  saying you were encouraging people to do it.
[16108.78s -> 16109.66s]  He looked at me and said,
[16109.66s -> 16111.98s]  if he told you to jump off a bridge, would you?
[16111.98s -> 16112.70s]  And I said, yes.
[16115.93s -> 16117.29s]  Here's the thing though.
[16117.29s -> 16120.57s]  I explicitly told everybody not to do that.
[16120.81s -> 16122.25s]  Because it was incredibly rude
[16123.05s -> 16125.21s]  and it wasn't a nice thing to do.
[16126.01s -> 16131.24s]  Sorry to hear that you got reprimanded at Taco Bell
[16131.24s -> 16136.36s]  for being what any normal person would see as being a dick.
[16137.98s -> 16139.02s]  But thank you for the one dollar.
[16141.26s -> 16142.86s]  Raise and rise, thanks for the three bucks.
[16143.58s -> 16144.78s]  Divus, thanks for the two bucks.
[16145.98s -> 16147.34s]  Dork Cube, thanks for the one dollar.
[16147.34s -> 16150.14s]  My dad always said, measure twice, cut once.
[16150.14s -> 16152.38s]  But this stream proved that sometimes,
[16152.38s -> 16153.74s]  even when you measure 10 times,
[16153.74s -> 16155.50s]  you may still slice your finger off.
[16160.89s -> 16162.89s]  I'm getting a feel for the room too.
[16162.89s -> 16164.41s]  Because remember, this is the first time
[16165.61s -> 16169.56s]  I've ever experienced VR, standing up with a Vive.
[16169.56s -> 16171.88s]  My only real experience was PSVR
[16171.88s -> 16174.44s]  and I had to stand in the same spot.
[16174.44s -> 16176.67s]  So you guys just, you guys watched live
[16176.67s -> 16180.11s]  my first real ever like room VR experience.
[16180.11s -> 16182.12s]  So you kind of have to get used to it.
[16182.12s -> 16186.96s]  Do I still have PSVR?
[16186.96s -> 16187.44s]  I do not.
[16188.25s -> 16189.93s]  I actually gave it to a friend.
[16190.57s -> 16192.62s]  So I no longer have access to it.
[16192.62s -> 16193.58s]  But now I have a Vive.
[16193.58s -> 16197.92s]  So there's really no reason I don't think I have it.
[16198.48s -> 16200.88s]  There are a few PSVR exclusives that look interesting.
[16200.88s -> 16202.94s]  But I have a Vive.
[16202.94s -> 16205.10s]  So anytime I want to do VR, I'm just going to use that.
[16205.82s -> 16208.76s]  But thank you, Dork Cube.
[16208.76s -> 16209.32s]  Good advice.
[16210.35s -> 16212.11s]  Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the one dollar.
[16212.67s -> 16216.48s]  Andy say, hey, Jeremy, can you do a stream
[16216.48s -> 16217.68s]  where you just watch Willem Dafoe
[16217.68s -> 16219.12s]  talk about himself for 30 minutes?
[16220.00s -> 16227.53s]  Always eclipses the movie itself.
[16227.69s -> 16230.09s]  Willem Dafoe breaks down his most iconic character
[16230.09s -> 16231.21s]  for 35 minutes.
[16235.77s -> 16239.80s]  Well, no, 35 minutes.
[16241.87s -> 16243.31s]  I would watch that on your own time.
[16243.31s -> 16243.95s]  That's probably great.
[16244.59s -> 16246.27s]  He's one of the greatest actors we've ever seen.
[16249.02s -> 16250.30s]  But thank you, Superintendent Chalmers.
[16250.30s -> 16252.46s]  Thank you, Deviant XS for the one dollar.
[16252.46s -> 16254.94s]  Might be a good idea to put some straps on, bro.
[16256.75s -> 16258.83s]  Smashly, thanks for the four community subs earlier.
[16259.47s -> 16260.67s]  Tingy, thanks for the one dollar.
[16261.39s -> 16263.71s]  You had us in the first half of the most fun thing
[16263.71s -> 16265.87s]  you've ever done until you mentioned
[16265.87s -> 16266.99s]  riding roller coasters.
[16266.99s -> 16268.99s]  Everyone knows you must be this tall to ride.
[16274.64s -> 16277.68s]  You know that you could be like 48 inches tall
[16278.73s -> 16281.77s]  and still qualify for like the Superman ride of steel.
[16283.32s -> 16283.96s]  You know that, right?
[16284.60s -> 16288.01s]  So even if I was like four foot six,
[16288.73s -> 16290.81s]  I would still qualify for the Superman ride.
[16293.66s -> 16294.30s]  That's not true.
[16294.30s -> 16294.86s]  What are you talking about?
[16298.19s -> 16300.51s]  Five goddamn eight, five nine with heels on.
[16302.56s -> 16304.16s]  Thank you, trust no one for the three bucks.
[16304.72s -> 16305.87s]  Hello, Jeremy.
[16305.87s -> 16306.43s]  It's me again.
[16306.43s -> 16309.39s]  Last time we met, I was kind of obliged
[16309.39s -> 16311.87s]  to follow the same road as I had before.
[16311.87s -> 16312.75s]  That's all because of you.
[16312.75s -> 16314.67s]  Let's see where this road leads us this time.
[16315.47s -> 16317.61s]  Let's see where this road leads us.
[16321.36s -> 16324.64s]  This is 11 scariest germs caught by drones.
[16327.10s -> 16330.51s]  What the fuck is this?
[16332.11s -> 16334.16s]  Hold on.
[16334.16s -> 16334.64s]  I got to play it.
[16335.84s -> 16338.92s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16338.92s -> 16342.75s]  Let me see.
[16342.75s -> 16345.85s]  Is Willem Dafoe's video still playing?
[16348.68s -> 16349.72s]  Oh, I see what's going on.
[16349.72s -> 16351.80s]  Okay, I have to get the HTC Vive.
[16352.60s -> 16355.23s]  I'm going to go to my regular speakers.
[16355.23s -> 16355.79s]  Okay, there we go.
[16359.00s -> 16362.11s]  Now this should be playing, right?
[16362.11s -> 16365.52s]  Shit, why can I not hear this?
[16369.10s -> 16371.02s]  Yeah, the Vive kind of takes over your whole setup.
[16371.02s -> 16373.34s]  It takes over your mic, takes over your headphones.
[16374.22s -> 16377.68s]  Let me just put this back to get that better.
[16382.52s -> 16383.08s]  There we go.
[16383.08s -> 16384.12s]  Okay, now I can hear this.
[16384.68s -> 16385.64s]  All right, we're going to put this on.
[16386.20s -> 16389.92s]  Let's do a browser capture here.
[16389.92s -> 16390.80s]  Let's just watch this.
[16391.52s -> 16394.01s]  Because I am just chilling right now.
[16394.01s -> 16395.45s]  Just trying to relax out of the VR.
[16396.09s -> 16396.89s]  Let's watch a video.
[16397.45s -> 16406.76s]  This is the 11 scariest drones.
[16406.76s -> 16407.56s]  Let's go.
[16407.56s -> 16411.45s]  11 scariest things caught by drones.
[16412.17s -> 16412.65s]  Watch it.
[16413.61s -> 16414.49s]  I'm not going to watch that.
[16420.72s -> 16423.13s]  This is going to turn into the same joke again.
[16424.01s -> 16427.12s]  Yeah, this is the dirtiest hit.
[16427.84s -> 16435.84s]  This is a great Buzzfeed video.
[16436.56s -> 16448.08s]  Is that a demonic?
[16451.72s -> 16452.52s]  Oh, come on.
[16453.24s -> 16460.67s]  How is that a drone?
[16461.47s -> 16467.15s]  Kid was testing his new drone in the forest.
[16467.87s -> 16470.99s]  He's given a terrifying man these.
[16471.71s -> 16480.38s]  That's not even me.
[16483.32s -> 16510.17s]  Loch Ness is famous for its myth of what it smells like.
[16510.17s -> 16521.39s]  I got to just climb in the fucking window
[16521.39s -> 16522.59s]  and just start using the computer.
[16523.55s -> 16542.54s]  The next drone footage is too gruesome.
[16542.54s -> 16543.98s]  While in the air, the whole balloon crew
[16543.98s -> 16545.50s]  would be eaten alive by this thing.
[16560.30s -> 16562.78s]  How did you, the crop, you, the frame by frame,
[16562.78s -> 16563.58s]  crop that shit up?
[16586.06s -> 16586.94s]  That was wonderful.
[16588.22s -> 16592.81s]  Jeremy, please forgive me if I got you upset
[16592.81s -> 16594.81s]  by using your image in such unpleasant ways.
[16594.81s -> 16595.45s]  I didn't mean it.
[16596.41s -> 16597.05s]  No, that's fine.
[16598.01s -> 16598.65s]  This got me.
[16600.36s -> 16600.86s]  Probably.
[16603.63s -> 16604.43s]  Hey, look.
[16604.43s -> 16608.17s]  I wonder what's going to happen in like a week.
[16609.29s -> 16610.25s]  News bloopers.
[16610.73s -> 16616.49s]  Uh, and no, I'm not going to watch that video.
[16617.69s -> 16622.56s]  So not going to watch the best 2017 news bloopers.
[16623.44s -> 16630.68s]  See you in a week or two when we watch another one of these.
[16630.68s -> 16633.16s]  I'm not, well, I'm not going to watch news bloopers.
[16636.86s -> 16637.90s]  The cycle continues.
[16640.32s -> 16642.00s]  That was fucking hilarious.
[16642.00s -> 16642.48s]  That was great.
[16643.40s -> 16644.12s]  Thank you for that.
[16647.00s -> 16648.92s]  That was really, really, really fucking funny.
[16649.48s -> 16650.52s]  Thank you, trust no one.
[16650.52s -> 16652.28s]  From $3 and that video.
[16654.76s -> 16655.48s]  Jess, you got it.
[16655.48s -> 16656.28s]  Thanks for the $1.
[16656.28s -> 16657.48s]  You look like a chimney sweep.
[16659.60s -> 16662.12s]  I gotta go like wash my face.
[16662.12s -> 16664.12s]  I gotta get in the shower and like condition my hair.
[16664.76s -> 16670.78s]  Thank you super seal for the $2.50.
[16670.78s -> 16674.38s]  Drink orange juice after brushing your teeth on stream or scared.
[16676.03s -> 16677.55s]  That's gonna ruin orange juice for me.
[16678.86s -> 16680.70s]  I don't put alcohol in my orange juice
[16680.70s -> 16683.42s]  and I don't brush my teeth and drink orange juice
[16683.42s -> 16684.22s]  because it ruins it.
[16684.86s -> 16692.62s]  I have something to look up how to clean the inside of your Vive visor
[16692.62s -> 16693.98s]  because it is disgusting.
[16695.72s -> 16698.20s]  If somebody was here and they had a cotton swab or something
[16698.20s -> 16700.68s]  or like a Q-tip and you just went,
[16700.68s -> 16704.28s]  you dragged across the front of that glass in there,
[16705.47s -> 16707.15s]  you would have enough to probably make
[16707.15s -> 16709.47s]  a whole nother like species of fucking mutants.
[16710.11s -> 16711.15s]  It's filthy in there.
[16711.79s -> 16715.48s]  But thank you super seal.
[16715.48s -> 16715.96s]  Thank you again.
[16715.96s -> 16717.40s]  Frodeon weapon gave $50 early.
[16717.40s -> 16718.12s]  Thank you so much again.
[16721.07s -> 16722.27s]  Big money from Frodeon.
[16723.26s -> 16724.62s]  Timmy Tim Tim, thanks for the $1.
[16724.62s -> 16725.66s]  They say crazy person.
[16731.47s -> 16732.43s]  Crazy person.
[16732.43s -> 16734.43s]  No, this is just somebody playing VR.
[16736.68s -> 16737.16s]  Very okay.
[16737.16s -> 16742.76s]  If I didn't have the VR helmet or the helmet hair,
[16742.76s -> 16745.40s]  I need a haircut.
[16745.40s -> 16751.44s]  Look at that fucking helmet bedhead hair.
[16752.00s -> 16753.96s]  No, that's somebody just playing VR.
[16755.34s -> 16756.38s]  But thank you Timmy Tim Tim.
[16757.42s -> 16758.38s]  Guild here again.
[16758.38s -> 16759.66s]  Huge amount of community subs.
[16760.46s -> 16761.74s]  Renix, thanks for the $5.
[16762.46s -> 16763.98s]  After you download mod installer,
[16763.98s -> 16765.82s]  you can download songs in game.
[16765.82s -> 16766.30s]  Okay, cool.
[16766.94s -> 16768.54s]  I'll get that set up before we stream tomorrow.
[16771.00s -> 16772.76s]  Thank you Gibbler for the three bucks.
[16772.76s -> 16774.60s]  Jerma, I didn't know that you were a coal miner.
[16775.24s -> 16776.28s]  That's the one we just looked at.
[16776.92s -> 16781.29s]  It's fucking wild.
[16781.29s -> 16782.33s]  Thank you so much, Gibbler.
[16784.28s -> 16786.76s]  Mentosium, thanks for the four dollars and 20 cents.
[16786.76s -> 16789.24s]  Hey Jerma, got you featured on the Yogscast Jingle Jam.
[16789.24s -> 16791.00s]  I was wondering if you've seen harder,
[16791.00s -> 16792.44s]  better, faster Jerma on YouTube.
[16792.44s -> 16793.32s]  I think you'll enjoy it.
[16796.03s -> 16798.19s]  I think I do remember the Yogscast thing.
[16798.91s -> 16803.04s]  It was green screen footage, right?
[16803.04s -> 16805.69s]  It was good shit.
[16805.69s -> 16806.09s]  I'm here.
[16806.09s -> 16806.49s]  I'm right here.
[16806.49s -> 16806.89s]  I'm right here.
[16806.89s -> 16808.01s]  You don't have to beep.
[16808.01s -> 16809.45s]  You don't have to beep.
[16809.45s -> 16809.77s]  I'm here.
[16811.96s -> 16813.08s]  Better, faster Jerma, I think.
[16813.64s -> 16815.88s]  Did we watch that like last week or something?
[16818.04s -> 16818.92s]  The name is familiar.
[16818.92s -> 16820.36s]  I'm not sure if maybe we have.
[16824.06s -> 16824.54s]  No, me.
[16825.10s -> 16826.70s]  I vaguely remember.
[16826.70s -> 16832.20s]  I don't think we did.
[16834.68s -> 16835.96s]  Better, faster, hold on.
[16835.96s -> 16836.76s]  What's it called?
[16836.76s -> 16844.01s]  Better, faster, harder, better, faster Jerma.
[16844.01s -> 16845.44s]  Let me take a look and see.
[16860.43s -> 16861.79s]  Oh, it's a green screen video.
[16861.79s -> 16867.76s]  Okay, I'm going to save this.
[16868.40s -> 16870.00s]  And I know I've said this a bunch of times,
[16870.00s -> 16873.66s]  but the green screen encore stream
[16874.73s -> 16876.57s]  is actually going to happen here
[16876.57s -> 16879.85s]  probably next week or the week after.
[16879.85s -> 16880.89s]  It's actually going to happen.
[16882.28s -> 16884.36s]  I've talked about it for the last three and a half weeks
[16885.00s -> 16887.24s]  and it's time to actually compile them
[16887.24s -> 16889.80s]  and do another encore green screen night.
[16891.58s -> 16893.90s]  So in maybe two weeks,
[16894.62s -> 16898.49s]  I'm actually going to talk to the mods about it.
[16898.49s -> 16899.53s]  We'll figure it out again.
[16903.23s -> 16906.43s]  But this one is not another submissions thing
[16906.43s -> 16909.47s]  as much as it is like a couple hours of ones
[16909.47s -> 16910.91s]  that have come out since.
[16910.91s -> 16912.88s]  So it's not going to be another.
[16912.88s -> 16914.16s]  All right, here's a ton of submissions here.
[16914.16s -> 16915.84s]  We're going to watch like 500 videos.
[16917.02s -> 16918.06s]  I'd like to keep it a little.
[16918.62s -> 16922.06s]  Maybe we'll do it at the end of one stream in particular.
[16922.06s -> 16923.55s]  Might be fun to do.
[16926.01s -> 16927.29s]  It's like Christmas morning.
[16927.29s -> 16930.41s]  My hair, if I grab the front of my hair
[16931.05s -> 16934.81s]  and if I pulled even with like a quarter of a pound of pressure,
[16934.81s -> 16936.33s]  the whole tuft is going to come out.
[16939.23s -> 16941.71s]  I'm going to have to do like a treatment to my head.
[16944.83s -> 16945.55s]  We'll watch that.
[16945.55s -> 16947.71s]  I will make sure it's saved a book market
[16947.71s -> 16950.73s]  because green screen stuff I'd like to watch
[16951.74s -> 16958.62s]  in a better setting where we're all ready for it.
[16958.62s -> 16962.32s]  But thank you so much, Mentosium.
[16963.31s -> 16964.35s]  We will see it soon.
[16966.62s -> 16969.08s]  Thank you, Freudian Weapon for the four dollars.
[16969.08s -> 16972.28s]  Random question, but I'm making a video game themed workout playlist.
[16972.84s -> 16976.12s]  Any actiony game OSTs you could recommend.
[16976.12s -> 16976.84s]  I love the VR stuff.
[16976.84s -> 16978.68s]  Can't wait to see the upcoming craziness.
[16978.68s -> 16979.55s]  Have a good night.
[16981.15s -> 16987.48s]  Uh, a video game theme, but any actiony game OSTs?
[16987.48s -> 16992.94s]  I mean, the easy one is probably Hotline.
[16992.94s -> 16993.98s]  Somebody already said it.
[16993.98s -> 16998.41s]  Hotline Miami is really, you know, will really pump you up.
[16999.05s -> 16999.77s]  Both OSTs.
[16999.77s -> 17000.57s]  I would just get them both.
[17004.12s -> 17008.22s]  Any other OSTs?
[17008.22s -> 17009.90s]  That's what I would say those first.
[17014.19s -> 17014.59s]  Doom.
[17014.59s -> 17018.48s]  Doom is more, man, maybe.
[17019.12s -> 17024.75s]  Just go get the whole Smash Brothers.
[17024.75s -> 17027.07s]  Go get the entire Smash Brothers OST.
[17027.07s -> 17032.30s]  But yeah, probably I would say Hotline Miami.
[17033.93s -> 17035.45s]  Flammable Cowl, thanks for the five dollars.
[17035.45s -> 17039.29s]  I recently started playing Chrono Trigger after you mentioned it and enjoyed it.
[17039.29s -> 17042.81s]  I didn't have the privilege of growing up in the boomer generation and was wondering
[17042.81s -> 17044.97s]  what's an old underrated game that you recommend.
[17044.97s -> 17046.33s]  Much love, The Neverhood.
[17046.33s -> 17048.32s]  I'll say that every single time.
[17048.88s -> 17050.64s]  Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger, The Neverhood.
[17051.28s -> 17053.44s]  Um, some of the other old ones.
[17057.00s -> 17058.28s]  That's probably the top three.
[17058.28s -> 17062.24s]  It's really hard to get a hold of The Neverhood, though.
[17066.94s -> 17067.58s]  Earthworm Jims.
[17067.58s -> 17069.02s]  Earthworm Jims, I don't know if I...
[17069.98s -> 17072.38s]  I'm not so sure Earthworm Jims still holds up.
[17073.02s -> 17077.45s]  It's been a long time since I played it, but I remember trying to play it again
[17077.45s -> 17079.45s]  within the last five or so years.
[17080.33s -> 17086.16s]  And it was, it was like, I wasn't really enjoying it.
[17086.16s -> 17088.48s]  The soundtrack for Earthworm Jim is amazing.
[17088.48s -> 17095.79s]  But The Neverhood is, I just love that game.
[17095.79s -> 17101.95s]  Add Desert Bus VR to the games to play tomorrow.
[17101.95s -> 17107.40s]  Well, I want to go through the most requested ones first.
[17107.40s -> 17110.36s]  Because stuff like Blade and Source, ReBeat Saber, Budget Cuts,
[17111.44s -> 17113.36s]  uh, like Super Hot VR.
[17113.36s -> 17115.40s]  There's a couple of like the...
[17115.40s -> 17119.48s]  There's at least like five that people really, really wanted to see
[17119.48s -> 17121.72s]  and that I was really wanting to play.
[17121.72s -> 17130.32s]  So we'll do some other weird random ones after we go through like the top ones.
[17130.32s -> 17136.70s]  Gorn, yeah, Gorn's another one.
[17136.70s -> 17141.90s]  Yeah, there's so many to play that I don't want to really overwhelm myself
[17141.90s -> 17143.80s]  because here's what's going to happen, right?
[17143.80s -> 17147.63s]  So when we're doing these VR streams,
[17149.52s -> 17153.36s]  I'd like to only do like a few of them each night,
[17153.36s -> 17154.96s]  maybe like two or three of them each night
[17154.96s -> 17159.20s]  because I want to get the whole experience from these games.
[17159.20s -> 17162.64s]  I don't want to just open like Budget Cuts and play it for 20 minutes
[17162.64s -> 17163.68s]  and be like, all right, what's the next one?
[17163.68s -> 17164.72s]  I got like 15 of these.
[17164.72s -> 17168.08s]  It's not like the PlayStation 2 streams or the Dreamcast stuff,
[17168.08s -> 17170.80s]  or I want to give each one at least like a couple hours
[17170.80s -> 17175.00s]  or like one, at least one to two hours.
[17175.00s -> 17177.00s]  So I can get the whole experience out of them.
[17177.00s -> 17183.04s]  And I'm not exactly sure how long something like Budget Cuts is.
[17183.12s -> 17188.32s]  But it feels like I'm getting at least enough of a package there
[17188.32s -> 17190.72s]  where I've had enough fun where I'm ready to do something else.
[17190.72s -> 17195.13s]  But we'll see.
[17195.13s -> 17198.14s]  I will have another list of about three or four,
[17198.14s -> 17203.84s]  maybe three or so tomorrow.
[17203.84s -> 17204.88s]  But thank you, Flammable Cow.
[17204.88s -> 17206.40s]  Thank you, Buster Boy, for the three bucks.
[17206.96s -> 17208.40s]  How can I gift you Steam games?
[17208.40s -> 17211.60s]  There's a game called Jet Island that is an amazing VR game
[17211.60s -> 17213.31s]  that I'd like you to play.
[17213.31s -> 17216.57s]  You don't have to do any gifting or anything like that.
[17217.13s -> 17218.57s]  If you have a recommendation for a game,
[17219.29s -> 17220.41s]  I have a Discord.
[17220.41s -> 17222.08s]  If you want to go to the Discord,
[17222.08s -> 17224.76s]  there's a recommended channel.
[17224.76s -> 17227.24s]  You can go there and just put anything
[17227.24s -> 17229.50s]  that you think you'd like to see on stream.
[17229.50s -> 17231.74s]  It's not a discussion channel.
[17231.74s -> 17234.22s]  It's just a place to put recommendations.
[17234.22s -> 17235.92s]  And I look at it all the time.
[17235.92s -> 17238.80s]  I look at the recommended channel at least once a week
[17238.80s -> 17240.64s]  and I kind of scroll up and see what's been said.
[17240.64s -> 17242.56s]  And if I want to do something and I can, you know,
[17242.56s -> 17245.00s]  pinpoint things that I'd like to do.
[17245.00s -> 17247.68s]  So yeah, recommend a channel in the Discord
[17247.68s -> 17250.17s]  if you have anything you'd like me to check out.
[17250.17s -> 17253.10s]  But thank you, Buster Boy, for the three bucks.
[17254.35s -> 17257.07s]  Hey, something or other and there's no music, is there?
[17257.07s -> 17258.43s]  No, get back here.
[17258.43s -> 17260.65s]  Something or other, thanks for the one dollar.
[17260.65s -> 17261.53s]  Agent Smith voice.
[17262.09s -> 17264.25s]  You can't escape the Matrix, Mr. Elbertson.
[17264.81s -> 17272.35s]  I'll get out.
[17272.35s -> 17274.35s]  Hey, for real though, thanks for the two dollars and 50 cents.
[17274.35s -> 17276.19s]  Did you eat your Rice Krispies this morning?
[17276.92s -> 17278.52s]  Did I eat my Rice Krispies?
[17283.00s -> 17285.00s]  It's the only cereal that talks to you
[17285.00s -> 17287.24s]  and that makes for a great company in the morning.
[17287.24s -> 17288.76s]  How do you know we don't just fucking run?
[17296.01s -> 17297.05s]  I don't know what that is.
[17297.05s -> 17298.41s]  I don't know if I want to play that.
[17298.41s -> 17299.61s]  I don't know what that is.
[17299.61s -> 17304.48s]  But thank you for the two dollars and 50 cents.
[17304.48s -> 17306.48s]  Because, you know, living one life sucks enough.
[17307.04s -> 17309.12s]  Going through the hardships of one life is bad enough,
[17309.12s -> 17309.92s]  but to do it again,
[17310.88s -> 17317.18s]  I read this pamphlet at my doctor's office one time.
[17317.18s -> 17324.22s]  There it is.
[17324.22s -> 17326.38s]  You really do need context.
[17326.38s -> 17328.38s]  There's no context at the audio.
[17328.38s -> 17329.98s]  It's just, it makes no sense.
[17330.54s -> 17332.46s]  It'll make perfect sense if you watch it.
[17334.80s -> 17335.76s]  Thank you for real though.
[17335.76s -> 17337.28s]  Thank you, Tingy, for the one dollar in my last bit,
[17337.28s -> 17339.12s]  so I might as well use them before it goes to two fifty.
[17339.68s -> 17341.52s]  Just want to say that I love this community and you,
[17341.52s -> 17341.92s]  Jerma.
[17341.92s -> 17343.60s]  You guys make each stream a great experience.
[17345.08s -> 17345.96s]  Thank you so much, Tingy.
[17347.39s -> 17350.03s]  Yeah, the two fifty minimum is just,
[17350.03s -> 17352.19s]  it's just gonna happen here probably tomorrow.
[17354.27s -> 17360.88s]  I will probably continue to read under two fifty
[17362.03s -> 17364.19s]  for at least maybe like one or two more streams
[17364.19s -> 17365.63s]  after the change.
[17366.43s -> 17368.83s]  Just because there's no way with the amount of people
[17368.83s -> 17371.47s]  that are here that everybody will know.
[17371.47s -> 17372.19s]  You know what I'm saying?
[17372.99s -> 17374.35s]  It's changing tomorrow,
[17374.99s -> 17378.03s]  but I'm gonna continue to read under two fifty
[17378.03s -> 17379.31s]  for at least another two or three streams.
[17379.87s -> 17386.57s]  Because, I mean, it's hard to keep everybody
[17386.57s -> 17387.37s]  aware of what's going on.
[17388.09s -> 17395.00s]  But thank you for the one dollar.
[17395.00s -> 17397.56s]  It's a pleasure to have as many great people
[17397.56s -> 17398.68s]  here as there are.
[17398.68s -> 17399.40s]  So thank you.
[17400.12s -> 17402.16s]  Put it in the stream title.
[17403.92s -> 17405.20s]  Maybe, I don't know if I want to like
[17405.20s -> 17406.48s]  blow it up the stream title though.
[17406.48s -> 17408.00s]  It already has like the shirts thing there.
[17408.80s -> 17410.16s]  And I don't want to be like one of those,
[17411.12s -> 17412.24s]  exclamation point shirts,
[17412.24s -> 17413.68s]  exclamation point stream changes,
[17413.68s -> 17415.04s]  exclamation point prime,
[17415.04s -> 17415.76s]  exclamation point.
[17416.40s -> 17417.76s]  Once you start adding exclamation points,
[17417.76s -> 17418.48s]  they just keep going.
[17423.40s -> 17424.76s]  Everyone knows about the shirts though.
[17424.76s -> 17425.72s]  It's not necessarily true,
[17426.36s -> 17429.96s]  but thank you Tingy.
[17431.21s -> 17433.05s]  Thank you Radja Sil for the one dollar.
[17433.05s -> 17434.57s]  Hey Jerma, I've been standing outside your window
[17434.57s -> 17436.09s]  trying to get your attention for about two hours.
[17436.73s -> 17437.69s]  But you're not noticing me.
[17437.69s -> 17438.97s]  I've been revving up my engine
[17438.97s -> 17440.41s]  and honking my horn and everything.
[17441.13s -> 17443.32s]  Well, you did get my attention.
[17443.32s -> 17444.12s]  I didn't know it was you.
[17444.84s -> 17447.07s]  But thank you for the one dollar.
[17447.07s -> 17448.59s]  Thank you Clueless Sniper for the one dollar.
[17449.31s -> 17449.79s]  Appreciate it.
[17449.79s -> 17450.11s]  Thank you.
[17451.07s -> 17453.15s]  And finally here we had Adala from Multitrip.
[17453.87s -> 17454.91s]  I don't know if it's on the list,
[17454.91s -> 17456.35s]  but you should definitely play hot dogs,
[17456.35s -> 17458.03s]  horseshoes, and hand grenades.
[17458.03s -> 17460.59s]  It's basically like that first game you played,
[17460.59s -> 17462.83s]  but with guns and tons of game modes.
[17465.79s -> 17466.27s]  Absolutely.
[17468.57s -> 17471.45s]  I am 100% on board
[17472.01s -> 17473.53s]  with any and all of these really,
[17473.53s -> 17474.81s]  really interesting VR games.
[17475.53s -> 17477.66s]  Because I am, it's, you know, it's great.
[17478.54s -> 17480.70s]  It's like, okay.
[17480.70s -> 17483.80s]  So if you, I'm like two and a half,
[17483.80s -> 17485.16s]  three years late to this shit.
[17486.04s -> 17489.08s]  There's such a huge compiling of awesome VR games.
[17489.82s -> 17491.98s]  This has to be what it feels like.
[17491.98s -> 17493.50s]  If you're, if you're like,
[17493.50s -> 17495.90s]  let's say like 11, 12, 13 years old right now,
[17496.46s -> 17498.14s]  you grow up, you know, you're 13,
[17498.14s -> 17500.30s]  you turn 14, 50, get your steam account.
[17500.30s -> 17501.90s]  When you, you've got like,
[17501.90s -> 17504.70s]  think of all the shit that like a 15, 16 year old
[17504.70s -> 17506.86s]  that gets their hand on steam for the first time.
[17507.58s -> 17511.74s]  This backlog of a decade of incredible experiences
[17511.74s -> 17512.22s]  that they have.
[17514.56s -> 17519.29s]  Wow. That's how I feel right now.
[17519.29s -> 17521.05s]  I feel like I'm 12.
[17521.05s -> 17522.41s]  I just made my steam account.
[17523.15s -> 17525.55s]  And Rajasil, if you're going to drive by,
[17525.55s -> 17527.23s]  at least like make it, must know it's you.
[17528.35s -> 17531.71s]  But I feel like I'm 12.
[17531.71s -> 17533.23s]  And I just made my first ever steam account.
[17533.23s -> 17534.83s]  And like The Witcher 3.
[17535.39s -> 17535.95s]  Holy shit.
[17535.95s -> 17536.91s]  I've never, what's that one?
[17537.47s -> 17538.35s]  What, there's three of these?
[17538.35s -> 17540.43s]  I can play one, two, and three.
[17540.43s -> 17541.47s]  I don't even know what this is.
[17543.76s -> 17544.32s]  What's this game?
[17544.32s -> 17545.36s]  The Team Fortress?
[17545.92s -> 17547.12s]  What the fuck is that thing?
[17548.40s -> 17551.44s]  I've never even been inside this game once.
[17551.44s -> 17552.72s]  That's how I feel right now with VR.
[17556.62s -> 17557.82s]  By the way, I've never played through
[17557.82s -> 17559.18s]  any of The Witcher games.
[17559.18s -> 17561.10s]  I'm just pretending to think they're cool.
[17561.10s -> 17562.54s]  So people will think I'm, you know,
[17562.54s -> 17564.59s]  they can pretend to think I'm cool.
[17564.59s -> 17571.15s]  That's the only reason why I said that.
[17571.15s -> 17577.20s]  I'm just pretending to know what they are.
[17577.20s -> 17578.56s]  You are not cool.
[17582.41s -> 17583.21s]  It has a horse.
[17586.40s -> 17588.00s]  And at the very end here, we got double D,
[17588.80s -> 17590.48s]  doubled 11 for the $2 here.
[17592.20s -> 17595.13s]  Hey, are you also going to do VR chat with Kiwo?
[17595.13s -> 17595.69s]  Yes.
[17595.69s -> 17598.41s]  But that's going to have to be at a different time.
[17599.13s -> 17601.37s]  Because I was told, I was under the impression,
[17601.37s -> 17603.69s]  I think that Kiwo is not available.
[17604.41s -> 17606.57s]  I think that Kiwo is doing something.
[17606.57s -> 17608.49s]  She's gone or not around or something.
[17609.05s -> 17613.20s]  I was going to get the VR chat tutorial
[17613.20s -> 17614.48s]  from Kiwo as a stream.
[17615.53s -> 17617.77s]  That is not going to be part of this,
[17617.77s -> 17619.77s]  you know, two or three streams in a row of VR.
[17620.33s -> 17621.61s]  That's going to be, I just have it.
[17621.61s -> 17625.61s]  And when we can, because maybe she's, she's EU, right?
[17625.61s -> 17628.25s]  So that's going to be, that's going to be a little
[17628.25s -> 17629.45s]  fucky trying to get that to work.
[17629.45s -> 17634.67s]  Because I am like almost eight to 10 hours behind her.
[17635.61s -> 17636.65s]  So we'll figure it out.
[17637.29s -> 17642.99s]  But I look forward to the VR tutorial.
[17648.16s -> 17649.92s]  Streams like 12 hours a day.
[17651.36s -> 17652.48s]  God, I wish I had the energy.
[17654.65s -> 17657.21s]  Like I put like laser beams into my eyes for four hours
[17657.21s -> 17658.33s]  and I have to like go lie down.
[17659.93s -> 17661.69s]  And they all say I have a 200 word essay due
[17661.69s -> 17662.57s]  and I'm here watching Jerma.
[17662.57s -> 17664.06s]  What am I doing?
[17664.06s -> 17665.50s]  You added 50 words.
[17665.50s -> 17668.30s]  Hey Buster Boy, thanks for the $1 at the very end.
[17668.30s -> 17669.82s]  I got my Oculus Rift a month ago
[17669.82s -> 17671.18s]  and I know exactly what you're saying.
[17671.18s -> 17671.90s]  Yeah, it's great.
[17674.19s -> 17676.51s]  I have like a year and a half worth
[17676.51s -> 17677.87s]  of experiences that I haven't done.
[17678.43s -> 17679.47s]  So it feels great.
[17681.72s -> 17682.68s]  And let's run the credits.
[17682.68s -> 17683.40s]  That's the end of the bits.
[17689.15s -> 17694.89s]  I will see you fine group of people tomorrow.
[17694.89s -> 17701.02s]  Tomorrow is the day for more VR.
[17701.02s -> 17708.33s]  He's pretending that that joke wasn't made last stream.
[17714.30s -> 17715.90s]  Really short post stream today.
[17716.80s -> 17719.20s]  Yeah, I got to figure it's because of VR.
[17720.32s -> 17723.12s]  Because I didn't have the stream labs wasn't really on.
[17723.12s -> 17724.48s]  I can't really see anything anyways.
[17728.41s -> 17729.29s]  But no, it's all good.
[17729.85s -> 17731.42s]  It's good shit.
[17733.45s -> 17736.41s]  Are you going to have OVR drop working next time?
[17736.41s -> 17738.41s]  Do you need any help to get it attached to your hand?
[17739.13s -> 17739.93s]  I might.
[17740.97s -> 17742.65s]  I didn't really do a proper tutorial.
[17742.65s -> 17746.00s]  So I did get the chat to be on the screen.
[17746.64s -> 17748.08s]  But I want to get it like in that position.
[17748.08s -> 17749.60s]  But here's the weird part though, right?
[17750.24s -> 17751.92s]  So getting the chat on your hand.
[17752.80s -> 17756.64s]  Wouldn't that conflict with doing actions in the game?
[17757.36s -> 17759.28s]  So let's say I was in budget cuts, right?
[17760.35s -> 17763.39s]  How do I make it so I because I have the gun on my hand.
[17763.39s -> 17764.35s]  And I lift up my hand.
[17764.35s -> 17764.99s]  There's the gun.
[17766.16s -> 17768.88s]  How is the chat just always going to be on the hand?
[17768.88s -> 17776.94s]  Or do I have to do like a certain I have to rotate my hand to see it.
[17776.94s -> 17777.18s]  Okay.
[17779.02s -> 17780.62s]  Yeah, I plan on watching a couple of tutorials.
[17780.62s -> 17783.58s]  But if I'm still having trouble, then I'll be in the discord.
[17783.58s -> 17786.30s]  You bet your ass tomorrow at like 2 30.
[17786.30s -> 17790.14s]  I'll be in the discord like, look, I tried it and I don't understand how it worked.
[17790.70s -> 17796.54s]  But I'm going to give it a try.
[17797.18s -> 17798.14s]  Hey, pigeon.
[17798.14s -> 17799.50s]  Thanks for the one dollar.
[17799.50s -> 17802.14s]  Just got my interviews with mods and newbie done.
[17802.14s -> 17804.06s]  And I'm ready to start banging out that essay.
[17804.06s -> 17804.38s]  Sort of.
[17804.38s -> 17806.70s]  I need to compile that information into sections.
[17807.26s -> 17810.84s]  Make sure you use the quote where I said, eat your vegetables.
[17810.84s -> 17815.24s]  Eat plenty of high quality proteins like salmon and tuna fish.
[17816.38s -> 17820.14s]  And if you're going to work out, make sure you give yourself enough rest.
[17822.17s -> 17825.29s]  You know, if you work out, you lift and you do bicep curls.
[17825.29s -> 17827.77s]  Don't do bicep curls for like at least like three, four days.
[17828.41s -> 17829.61s]  Let your body recover.
[17829.61s -> 17830.89s]  Get that high quality protein.
[17832.01s -> 17834.17s]  And that's how you do good working out.
[17834.17s -> 17838.83s]  For, wait, that was, okay, that was, you could still use that quote anyways.
[17838.83s -> 17842.27s]  Just use a section of that and use it as a quote.
[17842.27s -> 17843.87s]  What are the plans on the encore green screen night?
[17843.87s -> 17845.74s]  We just were talking about it.
[17845.74s -> 17848.22s]  We were talking about how it's probably going to happen in a couple of weeks.
[17848.22s -> 17849.18s]  Said that really fast.
[17850.14s -> 17850.62s]  Too fast.
[17850.62s -> 17857.10s]  It could slow down.
[17857.10s -> 17861.10s]  Just eat french fries only and only french fries and you'll be fine.
[17861.74s -> 17864.67s]  That is a very bad advice.
[17871.31s -> 17872.03s]  Hey, that's me.
[17874.68s -> 17876.28s]  Hey, Double D, thanks for the one dollar.
[17876.28s -> 17877.16s]  It's a YouTube link.
[17877.16s -> 17877.88s]  Let's see what it is.
[17881.48s -> 17883.72s]  One bit of, one bit of German wisdom.
[17883.72s -> 17884.52s]  That's what we're going to.
[17884.52s -> 17886.28s]  One bit of wisdom.
[17886.28s -> 17886.76s]  It's a lot.
[17886.76s -> 17887.48s]  It's a lot of value.
[17889.74s -> 17892.04s]  That's pretty good wisdom.
[17892.60s -> 17895.58s]  You know, don't.
[17896.70s -> 17897.26s]  Be careful.
[17900.65s -> 17901.37s]  You're not going to get out.
[17906.20s -> 17907.08s]  All right, guys.
[17907.16s -> 17909.48s]  I will see you tomorrow with more VR.
[17909.48s -> 17910.20s]  I'm going to clean up.
[17910.20s -> 17911.32s]  I'm going to clean my shit up.
[17911.96s -> 17913.68s]  There's shit all over the place.
[17913.68s -> 17914.32s]  I've got to clean it up.
[17915.45s -> 17919.13s]  And the VR helmet needs a little bit of TLC here.
[17920.09s -> 17921.71s]  I'm going to take a shower.
[17922.73s -> 17923.37s]  See you tomorrow.
[17923.37s -> 17924.33s]  Have a great rest of your night.
[17924.97s -> 17926.00s]  Take care.
[17926.89s -> 17954.49s]  And ta ta.
