[0.31s -> 13.30s]  Today is a special day. Adventure is ready. It's Gomez time.
[13.30s -> 21.24s]  Yay. Anytime now. Just you wait. There you go. Yay. Hexagonal rocks. Hexafree.
[21.24s -> 22.84s]  This thing is vibrating on my peep.
[26.10s -> 27.62s]  I gotta like lift that up.
[27.62s -> 31.82s]  Please stop vibrating on Jerma's peep. He's just trying to play the game.
[31.82s -> 35.26s]  I just want to play Fez. I just want to play this dumb indie game that I heard was good.
[36.22s -> 37.42s]  Well then it's not dumb is it?
[39.58s -> 41.34s]  This is pretty dumb what's happening right now.
[44.26s -> 46.76s]  Is it still vibrating on your peep?
[46.76s -> 49.48s]  All right, we got 3D inside 2D. All right, cool.
[50.36s -> 53.24s]  Yeah, that's the plot of the game. You discover the third dimension.
[53.24s -> 58.04s]  We got like a weird like TV changer beeper that's up in there like telling me like directions.
[58.68s -> 60.78s]  Can you just enjoy life?
[64.30s -> 67.69s]  What is this? What is this like McDonald's french fry box?
[67.69s -> 68.57s]  I don't know.
[68.57s -> 73.61s]  I wish you could see this. Oh, it's a Fez. It's the Fez.
[76.38s -> 76.88s]  Yay.
[77.58s -> 80.30s]  Fezzes are cool. Why is Doctor Who 2?
[81.02s -> 84.30s]  Wow, all right. This is way more interesting than I thought it was going to be.
[84.30s -> 85.18s]  The game's breaking.
[86.81s -> 87.45s]  Why?
[87.45s -> 88.84s]  I don't know.
[88.84s -> 89.64s]  I didn't do it.
[89.64s -> 92.12s]  Like I'm just sitting here playing a 10 million.
[92.12s -> 96.09s]  All right, you know in regular Nintendo games when it when like the game crashes
[96.09s -> 98.17s]  and it has like those weird pixelated colored things.
[98.17s -> 101.18s]  It's doing that right now.
[101.18s -> 102.14s]  On purpose or?
[102.14s -> 103.74s]  Yeah, like on purpose.
[103.74s -> 106.54s]  Oh, you're making it sound so dramatic.
[106.54s -> 107.42s]  This is so cool.
[109.64s -> 113.11s]  It just pretended to like restart the computer.
[113.11s -> 116.15s]  I think you're spoiling the experience for me when I play it
[116.15s -> 118.63s]  because now it's going to happen to me and I'm not going to think it's cool.
[118.63s -> 119.75s]  I'm going to think it's boring.
[119.75s -> 121.27s]  Why am I at the menu again?
[121.27s -> 123.18s]  Maybe it restarted.
[123.18s -> 131.00s]  Did I like just did this like just fuck up something went wrong?
[131.00s -> 131.88s]  I need your help.
[131.88s -> 133.00s]  I was sent to guide you.
[133.00s -> 135.11s]  I am gut the hex of Fez.
[135.11s -> 135.91s]  You've got a fragment.
[138.25s -> 139.93s]  Give you give you a life story of somebody else.
[139.93s -> 141.05s]  I got like places to be.
[141.05s -> 141.53s]  Fuck face.
[145.56s -> 149.10s]  All right.
[149.50s -> 153.05s]  On second thought, I'm not sure how much of this game I could even play.
[153.05s -> 153.93s]  Why?
[153.93s -> 155.29s]  Because it's going to make me sick.
[160.57s -> 162.68s]  Stop complaining.
[162.68s -> 163.56s]  It's artistic.
[165.88s -> 170.55s]  Hey, honey, you want to kiss me?
[170.55s -> 171.51s]  Get up there.
[171.51s -> 176.06s]  Punch this like nerd in the glasses.
[176.06s -> 177.18s]  Where's the where's like the punch?
[177.18s -> 177.90s]  Where's the blood?
[179.42s -> 182.06s]  Where's the punch nerd in glasses button?
[182.06s -> 189.18s]  I can't open this.
[191.18s -> 193.26s]  They stole this from Zelda.
[193.26s -> 196.31s]  That's Zelda copy Zelda.
[196.31s -> 196.81s]  Zelda.
[200.60s -> 203.56s]  Twilight princess copied Majora's musk.
[203.56s -> 206.20s]  This game is a copy of League of Legends.
[207.24s -> 209.66s]  Why do I really gotta copy League?
[209.66s -> 211.42s]  See, there's like a person that you control.
[211.42s -> 213.74s]  This is a League of Legends copy.
[213.74s -> 217.21s]  Every game has Wukong now that League did it.
[217.21s -> 218.65s]  I just like fell to my death.
[218.65s -> 219.45s]  Whoops.
[219.45s -> 219.93s]  Wow.
[219.93s -> 221.13s]  League did it first.
[221.13s -> 224.73s]  What to do?
[224.73s -> 224.97s]  Should I?
[224.97s -> 225.69s]  I think I have to go open that.
[225.69s -> 228.81s]  Yeah, I gotta go open this door.
[228.81s -> 231.48s]  Scrub doesn't even know what to do.
[231.48s -> 234.36s]  Remember guys, this is a full let's play of this game.
[234.36s -> 237.85s]  I guess I got a key.
[237.85s -> 240.25s]  Hey guys, this is the final episode of this game.
[241.59s -> 246.09s]  It's funny because it's true.
[248.52s -> 250.76s]  Hey, this isn't a let's play channel.
[250.76s -> 252.52s]  It's a first impressions channel.
[252.52s -> 254.36s]  Yeah, this is my first impression of Fez.
[254.36s -> 257.32s]  And my first impression is pretty sick.
[257.32s -> 261.50s]  I bet you go in these doors.
[261.50s -> 262.78s]  Don't go in the doors.
[262.78s -> 263.42s]  Too late.
[263.42s -> 267.59s]  It's going to be something spooky.
[267.59s -> 272.26s]  No, I suck at fucking playing video games.
[273.14s -> 275.51s]  I like have no idea what's going on.
[275.51s -> 276.23s]  Hold on.
[276.23s -> 278.52s]  Can I spin this world around?
[278.52s -> 281.40s]  Oh, there's a chest over there.
[282.73s -> 283.85s]  Oh, I just do it.
[283.85s -> 285.69s]  I remember how I just said I suck at video games.
[285.69s -> 286.17s]  Yeah.
[286.17s -> 287.21s]  What a lie that was.
[287.21s -> 289.05s]  I just found a secret fucking chest.
[290.17s -> 290.89s]  Is it Harry?
[290.89s -> 292.57s]  Is it like a Harry chest?
[292.57s -> 295.10s]  No, I just got like my second stock.
[295.10s -> 301.03s]  Is this like a Mario 64 rip off?
[301.03s -> 302.47s]  What didn't this game rip off?
[304.87s -> 309.24s]  This game in reality is actually pretty like interesting.
[310.12s -> 318.95s]  Where are these last two pieces?
[318.95s -> 322.92s]  Where's my little Navi?
[322.92s -> 324.20s]  She goes, hey, listen.
[327.77s -> 329.61s]  Like from the Avatar movie?
[329.61s -> 332.34s]  Like Navi.
[332.34s -> 336.49s]  What is the name of the stupid thing from Link?
[336.49s -> 337.53s]  Legend from Link.
[338.09s -> 340.55s]  What is the fairy's name?
[340.55s -> 342.28s]  Navi, right?
[342.28s -> 344.36s]  There's like a different one every game.
[344.36s -> 345.88s]  What's the one in Ocarina of Time?
[345.88s -> 346.52s]  I don't know.
[346.52s -> 347.40s]  I've never played it.
[349.56s -> 352.36s]  You've never played Ocarina of Time?
[352.36s -> 354.04s]  No, I've never played any Zelda game.
[354.04s -> 357.32s]  The most I've played of a Zelda game was the one for like Nintendo.
[357.32s -> 361.85s]  Like the very first one I played like 10 minutes of.
[361.85s -> 362.49s]  Wow.
[362.49s -> 363.94s]  Oh my God.
[366.90s -> 369.78s]  You just pissed off every single person in this comment section.
[369.78s -> 372.34s]  That's either watching and or not watching this.
[376.63s -> 380.73s]  I'm taking so long to beat the first like tutorial.
[380.73s -> 381.53s]  It's okay.
[381.53s -> 383.05s]  It's a first impression.
[383.05s -> 385.48s]  Shit, I'm so fucking dumb.
[385.48s -> 386.44s]  No, I died.
[389.66s -> 391.34s]  Well, thank you so much for watching.
[391.90s -> 392.46s]  Let's play.
[396.09s -> 397.53s]  Where's this last cube?
[397.53s -> 400.17s]  Where's this little cube?
[400.17s -> 406.46s]  Okay, Star, I will give you a thousand dollars
[406.46s -> 408.70s]  if you can find where this last like little cube is.
[410.22s -> 411.50s]  I will turn the game on
[411.50s -> 414.78s]  and probably catch up to where you are in 30 seconds and find it.
[416.57s -> 418.65s]  I would probably assume that you would do that.
[418.65s -> 421.03s]  You'd be able to do that very easily.
[421.03s -> 422.39s]  This whole video.
[422.39s -> 423.99s]  Wait, oh, I used one of the keys.
[423.99s -> 424.71s]  Oh, yeah.
[426.30s -> 430.89s]  Yeah, give me that map, you prick.
[430.97s -> 432.09s]  Why are you such a dick?
[432.09s -> 433.05s]  I don't know.
[433.05s -> 434.97s]  Just like the little virtual pixel guys.
[437.27s -> 438.95s]  That guy just told me I picked up a map
[438.95s -> 440.55s]  and he goes, oh, you found a map.
[440.55s -> 442.31s]  Figure it out for yourself.
[442.31s -> 444.23s]  I swear to God, that's what he just said.
[444.23s -> 447.22s]  Aren't you sick of like games holding your hand?
[448.42s -> 449.22s]  Play a game.
[449.22s -> 451.30s]  Dude, I'm almost 30.
[451.30s -> 453.30s]  I need my handheld for stuff like this.
[454.42s -> 455.30s]  Do you know me?
[455.30s -> 456.25s]  I know you.
[456.25s -> 457.05s]  Have we met before?
[457.61s -> 458.09s]  Yeah.
[458.09s -> 460.17s]  Do you know me?
[460.17s -> 465.56s]  I think your name is like Greg.
[465.56s -> 467.72s]  Still on tutorial level, by the way.
[467.72s -> 470.92s]  Oh, I found it.
[470.92s -> 471.48s]  I found it.
[471.48s -> 476.71s]  This door hasn't been opened.
[476.71s -> 478.47s]  Yes, there's the last one.
[478.47s -> 482.25s]  Fez, baby.
[482.25s -> 483.13s]  Hooray.
[483.13s -> 483.85s]  You did it.
[485.00s -> 485.32s]  Yay.
[486.36s -> 487.74s]  Get a cube.
[487.74s -> 488.70s]  Get a cube.
[488.70s -> 490.54s]  Get a cube, cube, cube, cube, cube.
[490.54s -> 491.42s]  Get a cube.
[491.42s -> 493.11s]  Get a cube.
[493.11s -> 493.75s]  You did it.
[493.75s -> 495.46s]  Now you can unseal the door.
[495.46s -> 496.18s]  Let's go.
[496.18s -> 496.82s]  Let's go.
[496.82s -> 497.32s]  Hooray.
[504.28s -> 511.58s]  Oh, I died.
[511.58s -> 512.78s]  Oh, shit.
[512.78s -> 516.31s]  I'm so impatient.
[516.31s -> 517.43s]  I just want to drop.
[517.43s -> 522.95s]  Where's this door that I can unseal?
[522.95s -> 524.95s]  There it is.
[524.95s -> 527.59s]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's the tutorial.
[529.32s -> 531.48s]  Are you ready to begin your adventure?
[533.40s -> 535.06s]  Yeah, sure.
[535.06s -> 536.10s]  Hey, listen.
[536.10s -> 537.30s]  This is outside the village.
[537.30s -> 537.78s]  Be careful.
[537.78s -> 538.58s]  Use the world map.
[539.70s -> 541.59s]  That's OK.
[541.59s -> 542.63s]  I'm going to get there.
[542.63s -> 544.28s]  I'm going to get there.
[544.28s -> 545.64s]  OK, bye.
