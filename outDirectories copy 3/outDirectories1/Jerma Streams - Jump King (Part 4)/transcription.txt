[1.08s -> 6.33s]  Okay, sorry about that. I had to move around a bunch of stuff in my room.
[7.45s -> 12.50s]  All right, so what do you want to do for the next, like, couple hours or something?
[12.50s -> 21.82s]  Let's see, we got a dirty room. All right, let's, uh, let's get a pull-up. Why not?
[24.58s -> 36.26s]  Or maybe, uh, let's see, do roadblocks. Something relaxing? Yeah, we can, I mean,
[36.26s -> 39.38s]  we could go two days in a row doing something fucking wild and then just
[40.10s -> 46.42s]  fall on relaxation. I don't know if it's going to be Jump King. I don't think I can handle it.
[49.70s -> 64.76s]  I don't know if I can handle it. Nancy Drew? No, no, let me see what we got. Let me put up my
[64.76s -> 71.83s]  steam. I'm also kind of developing a migraine right now and I don't know if it's because
[73.32s -> 82.66s]  of this dream I had last night or I got a, first of all, actually, let's get on campus.
[82.66s -> 89.70s]  Let me just turn the webcam back on. This dream I had last night was fucking ridiculous. It was
[89.70s -> 100.31s]  insane. It's probably the most ridiculous dream I've ever had in my whole life. Uh, but let's
[100.31s -> 108.90s]  tell, I want to talk to you about it. And then maybe, um, I have Katana Zero. Is Katana Zero
[108.90s -> 121.50s]  like a super duper insane fast paced headache game? Yeah, it is. Okay. Watch me just open up
[121.50s -> 126.76s]  Jump King. Jump King is also a headache game. I'm definitely going to play that soon, but hold on.
[126.76s -> 137.21s]  Let me get this back on stream here. Oh, that's not in the right spot. This is my bomb guide.
[146.70s -> 150.14s]  So, uh, I had this dream last night and I'm going to do my best to explain this.
[151.30s -> 153.62s]  People are going to think that there's something wrong with me. There probably is.
[154.66s -> 159.66s]  So, you know, when you have a dream that just everything is so connected and just, it just
[159.66s -> 163.18s]  goes from bullet to bullet to bullet point to bullet point really fast. And it's as if you've
[163.18s -> 166.78s]  been sleeping for like fucking six hours, like you've been dreaming for six hours.
[168.47s -> 180.15s]  Oh, but it's actually in reality only been probably like 14 seconds. So I had this dream.
[180.15s -> 185.11s]  I actually wrote this dream down because it was so fucked up. I had to just rip off my iPad and
[185.11s -> 195.03s]  just start typing. So I'm sitting, I'm sitting on a beach, right? I'm on a beach and there is
[195.03s -> 199.27s]  a beautiful, beautiful beach and a huge mansion. I live in a huge mansion, apparently for some
[199.27s -> 205.90s]  reason. Right. And it's, it's like at least a 10 to $20 million house. This place is fucking huge.
[206.78s -> 215.02s]  And underneath there is this tunnel underneath the house. It's a big tunnel, huge, huge, huge.
[215.02s -> 221.66s]  You could be like a dozen cars can fit into more than that. So I'm sitting there and I don't know
[221.66s -> 227.82s]  why this big tunnel is under the house. It just is. So I'm swimming in this beach with this amazing
[227.82s -> 236.98s]  beach house. And all of a sudden I look up and a fucking an airplane, like a jet, a jet is just
[236.98s -> 243.06s]  screaming by and it's just like, that's getting kind of close. That's fucked up. Why is it getting
[243.06s -> 250.02s]  so close? This shit goes under my house way too close into the tunnel. It flies into the tunnel
[251.32s -> 255.24s]  and it's all, and I go, holy fuck, this is ridiculous. That I have, I have to do something.
[255.24s -> 261.16s]  I, this is ridiculous. It's going to my house. And I go under the water because I was like,
[261.16s -> 264.52s]  it's going to be so loud. And I plugged my fucking ears and I just hear,
[267.51s -> 273.75s]  and I'm under the fucking water going like, I opened my eyes and I could see dirt and debris
[273.75s -> 278.79s]  like coming into the fucking water and shit. And I'm like avoiding it. And I get out of the water
[278.79s -> 284.06s]  and I go, what the, what happened? And by the way, everything is normal. There's no,
[284.62s -> 289.34s]  there's no like wreckage or anything. It's, my house is perfectly fine. The house is completely
[289.34s -> 296.62s]  fine. So I walk, I've, I'm like running to the house and my sister and my fucking mother are in
[296.62s -> 301.82s]  the house and they're freaking out. They're going, what the hell was that? Yeah, that was a jet. I
[301.82s -> 305.74s]  don't know what that was. Like somebody did, was like a jet that just flew into the tunnel and it
[305.74s -> 309.98s]  like exploded. And I'm like, yeah, that's what the hell I got. We got to figure out what to do.
[309.98s -> 314.54s]  And I'm running by and there's, I have a big window right here, right? Huge window
[315.42s -> 320.22s]  out the window. I go, hold on. What's that? And I look out and there's like three,
[320.22s -> 327.10s]  it's my neighbor's yard and there's like two or three little dogs, little puppies, like little
[327.10s -> 331.74s]  tiny little dogs. And I'm going, oh, that's right. Those, that's the neighbor's dogs, the little dogs
[332.38s -> 342.34s]  and over perching on the fucking guy's wall is a tiger, a huge tiger. And I'm looking over going,
[342.34s -> 345.78s]  no, no, no, no, no, they're going to, they're going to kill, it's going to kill these geese.
[345.78s -> 350.66s]  He's going to kill those dogs. And my sister just goes, yeah, he's probably feeding right now.
[351.22s -> 357.34s]  And I'm just like, this is really bad. This is what we do. We have to do something. And we opened
[357.34s -> 364.06s]  up the sliding window and I screamed, right? I went like, and he freaked out and he ran away
[364.06s -> 370.28s]  for a second. And then my mother comes over, God bless her, right? My mother comes over and
[371.00s -> 375.88s]  like, it's like, okay, he got away. Let's close the window. And as she's moving the window with
[375.88s -> 380.60s]  her hands, it comes out of the frame and it's just, she's got it in her hands and she's like,
[380.60s -> 385.88s]  oh, the frame came out of the window. And the tiger comes back. The tiger comes back and he
[385.88s -> 389.72s]  like fucking looks right me in the eyes through the window, through the window. That's now open
[389.72s -> 395.30s]  because my mother, my mother took the whole frame off and I freaked the fuck out. I'm like,
[395.30s -> 399.78s]  mom, give me the fucking frame. Give me the fucking frame. We like sticking on the tigers,
[399.78s -> 404.82s]  fucking like walking towards the God, like getting really too close. And we get the fucking thing,
[404.82s -> 409.22s]  click it in and the tiger is still fucking there. We've just barely did it, right?
[410.78s -> 413.90s]  Right after that, I go, I gotta, I don't know what the fuck to do. I don't know what to do.
[413.90s -> 419.64s]  There's so much crazy shit going on. I gotta go get a weapon. So I fucking ran into what was
[419.64s -> 425.64s]  my huge like mansion living room and I grabbed a pair of shears. Okay. So I grab a pair of shears
[425.64s -> 431.64s]  and I flip them upside down to hold. So the rubber ends, I was going to like whack them
[431.64s -> 437.56s]  with the, with the other end. So I'm like, I'm going to go out there and like get out of here.
[437.56s -> 444.54s]  So, all right. I'm, I get that. I'll flip it around. I'm going outside. I hear somebody getting
[444.54s -> 450.78s]  mauled outside. Like, I'm like, someone's getting fucking mauled out there. So I,
[450.78s -> 454.38s]  I like go outside. I'm like, what the fuck happened? Somebody's getting
[454.38s -> 459.18s]  fucking mauled. So I'm out there and the tiger's not there anymore, but this guy is. And I don't
[459.18s -> 463.50s]  know if he was supposed to be my neighbor or I have no idea. He was just sitting there and he was
[463.50s -> 470.70s]  like blood everywhere. And he's just like, ah, you gotta take me to the hospital, man. And I'm like,
[470.94s -> 474.30s]  I don't know what to do. I'm like, stay right there. Just, just don't move. Don't move. Don't
[474.30s -> 476.86s]  move. And I fucking turned around and I'm like, I don't know what to do. And I ran back in the
[476.86s -> 481.02s]  house for a second. I was like, what do you call the police? And he goes, dude, are you fucking
[481.02s -> 486.70s]  serious, bro? I was like, I'm just trying to, I'm like, all right, let's, let's get you to the
[486.70s -> 490.22s]  fucking hospital. All right, let's get, I dropped my fucking thing. And I'm like, let's go, let's go
[490.22s -> 494.86s]  to the hospital to get in my car. And he goes, all right, sure. And he gets up and he's like normal
[494.86s -> 498.30s]  and he's like running and he goes, wait, wait, hold on a second. I can't go anywhere without my
[498.30s -> 505.29s]  cigarette. And he like went back to where he got mauled in the first place and like grabbed his
[505.29s -> 511.69s]  cigarettes. And then we ran out. And the last thing that I saw before I woke up was this fucking guy
[512.33s -> 516.57s]  putting a new cigarette in his mouth and we're running down the stairs and he's lighting it in
[516.57s -> 521.13s]  the house. And the thing that I, that out of all the crazy shit that happened, the thing that I
[521.13s -> 526.41s]  was most concerned about right now was you don't fucking, you're smoking in my house. You don't
[526.41s -> 535.22s]  smoke in my house. And then I woke up. Like you're smoking in my fucking house, dude. Like
[536.02s -> 544.46s]  kind of weird kind of like you think you can just do that. That was, it was insane.
[547.58s -> 552.89s]  And every single part of it was so intense. Everything I just described to you, each one of
[552.89s -> 558.09s]  those three different scenes was like living inside of a movie in three different occasions.
[560.55s -> 567.90s]  Oh, and I don't even know what that means. I don't know what that's supposed to mean,
[571.45s -> 574.89s]  but that was, that was, that was a wild one. It's been a while since I've had a dream like that.
[575.61s -> 580.89s]  Anyways, I just had to like vent that out because it was, that was seriously fucking ridiculous.
[580.89s -> 595.22s]  Anyways, we are going to do today, you know what, let's just, oh wait, what the fuck is this?
[615.32s -> 626.86s]  Jesus Christ. Oh, it's real. I mean, it is a real image, but not, it's doctored real.
[628.36s -> 629.24s]  And then of course there's
[647.35s -> 651.99s]  all right. What do I want to do? I'm like, I don't even know what I want to do. I want to like play
[651.99s -> 663.18s]  Jump King, but I'm not sure I have what it takes right now. I have what it takes last night. Go
[663.18s -> 672.34s]  back to the coin game. Uh, no AI Dungeon is not going to work. It takes, it's going to take too
[672.34s -> 686.04s]  long to set up. All right. I'll get a poll in here. I'll put a poll down. Why not play Neopets?
[686.76s -> 702.89s]  All right. Let's do, this is what I would do right now. Put that one on there. Put that one on there.
[704.01s -> 714.65s]  I need a third option too. How about, uh, no, no, Drew crew. Not today. What else can I put on this
[714.65s -> 732.54s]  list? Oh, this game looks like kind of cool. It's another cute game. All right. What do you want to
[732.54s -> 754.50s]  do? What do you want to do? It's a funny face stream. Oh yeah. That image just is still just
[754.50s -> 769.70s]  on there. You're right. Well, uh, I'm going to play Katana Katana Katana zero. Maybe just not
[769.70s -> 780.07s]  tonight. Katana zero is something that I'm going to do. Give us the king. Give us the game. I mean,
[780.07s -> 786.73s]  it looks, it looks like people, the majority want to see some Jump King. I can't just like turn my
[786.73s -> 793.67s]  brain off and let that just happen. It like just go as long as, like I said, I've developed a
[793.67s -> 801.08s]  fucking migraine. So it's gotta be something that's easy for my brain to understand.
[805.21s -> 814.66s]  All right. I'm going to close this. Jump King. Nice streamer bait game. Hey, I played Jump King
[814.66s -> 819.80s]  like two weeks ago, three weeks ago. I played it. We had, oh, I couldn't see any of the subs that
[819.80s -> 831.61s]  came in, if anything, but we did have a couple of big ones come in. A friend pal buddy gave 5,000
[831.61s -> 836.33s]  bits earlier. Thank you friend. Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars. They say bugleberry pottery was
[836.33s -> 840.25s]  definitely the worst joke of the year, but it was also the funniest shit. I also laughed my ass off
[840.25s -> 844.81s]  of you taking pottery lessons for it. Watched and loved the content for eight years. Keep doing you.
[847.11s -> 855.72s]  Here comes the jet from the dream. All right. Let's do some Jump King. I'm just, we'll just
[855.72s -> 865.22s]  chill for a little bit. I'm just going to open it, but thank you friend pal buddy. We also had 10
[865.22s -> 874.60s]  community subs from fluid mesic right now. Thank you fluid mesic. And I think that's it for now
[874.60s -> 879.48s]  because I couldn't see it. Put on some chill music. AI dungeon doesn't need setup.
[879.48s -> 883.72s]  Now I don't want to do that beta website one. It's not as interesting as the one from collab.
[885.54s -> 888.50s]  Jump King is the opposite of chill. Well, I'm not going to take it seriously.
[889.38s -> 895.59s]  I'm not going to take it seriously. We're just going to play it and relax. All right. Give me a
[895.59s -> 964.87s]  sec. I'll be back in one second while I set it up. Okay. Okay. That's not going to work. That's not
[964.87s -> 970.31s]  going to work. That's not going to work. That's not going to work. Jump King. I did save it right
[970.31s -> 982.25s]  before I got disconnected last night. I'm going to take it really, really just chill. You know,
[982.25s -> 990.81s]  I need my headphones. Yeah. Sorry for the large intermission here. I had my whole room set up
[990.81s -> 1009.93s]  differently for, uh, keep talking and you're going to explode. What was the gift you? Oh,
[1009.93s -> 1020.17s]  that's right. Yeah. I can grab that after. Let's change this shit around. Stop talking.
[1020.17s -> 1027.88s]  How about just stop talking? That makes sense. Just we'll cut the book. Stop talking.
[1036.34s -> 1066.01s]  No talking for two hours. Okay. Uh, let's continue. There's a hot babe at the top.
[1066.73s -> 1075.50s]  It's too loud. Is it too loud? It shouldn't be. It should be fine. All right. What can I know?
[1076.79s -> 1086.92s]  Okay. Stop talking. I know, right? I'm not supposed to talk. What's up here?
[1091.58s -> 1100.50s]  Do the big jump. I don't even know what the big jump means. Stop talking. I'm, I have to talk.
[1101.22s -> 1112.97s]  That's a much, that's a bigger jump than it looks like. Shit. Don't go all the way down.
[1113.53s -> 1127.18s]  I got here last time and then I fucked it all up. Didn't I? I'm trying to sleep. All right. I'll
[1127.18s -> 1143.69s]  stop. Uh, my head on this. Wait. Ooh, shit. All right. Hold on. It's all right. It's all right.
[1143.69s -> 1161.21s]  Just go. Oops. Oh, fine. Fine. Fine. Ah, Dermis too hard on himself. What do you mean? Okay. What's
[1161.21s -> 1171.53s]  up here? Oh, I remember this part. This part sucks. This part actually sucks. Oops. Oh, fuck,
[1171.53s -> 1177.03s]  fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I didn't see the lift here on the right. All right. How do I get up there?
[1177.03s -> 1186.79s]  Bounce off of it. Okay. Dermis so hard to do the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. All right. All
[1186.79s -> 1196.73s]  right. Is this the second DLC? I believe, no, I believe this is the first DLC. Holy shit. Okay.
[1200.34s -> 1210.54s]  Oof. I was tight. Okay. What's up? Oh, I did get up here. I remember I got up here and I was like,
[1210.54s -> 1220.84s]  oh, this is going to be easy. Okay. And you can fall all the way down this right side too.
[1221.48s -> 1236.46s]  Okay. For now, it's okay though. Now we're just across. Did you disconnect your stream last night?
[1237.26s -> 1240.38s]  I actually have no, that was insane timing because I didn't do anything.
[1241.61s -> 1261.96s]  I didn't do anything. It just happened. Shit. I was shorter than that one. Okay. Now what?
[1262.52s -> 1274.86s]  I don't know which way to go. Can I go? All right. I can go in here. All right. You didn't thank my
[1274.86s -> 1291.22s]  $300. Wait, that was 300 bucks. When was the 300 bucks? Oh shit. What? I was going to say,
[1291.22s -> 1300.17s]  what are you talking about? All right. How am I going to get up? I think I have to bounce off
[1300.17s -> 1312.90s]  of that and to there. Yep. What's up? Okay. Silver coin, silver coin, silver coin. Who cares?
[1313.46s -> 1330.17s]  No coins. I'm, I'm, I'm a non coin gamer. Okay. Again, or should I go, I'm going to go like this.
[1333.99s -> 1350.54s]  All right. Here we go. Okay. Now I gotta be careful. You're pretty good at this. I'm all
[1350.54s -> 1382.33s]  right. It's got, you gotta go right, left, right. You have to. It's all right. Fuck. Hmm. Oof. All
[1382.33s -> 1401.02s]  right. Oh, it's fuck. That's not good. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That jump sucks.
[1403.24s -> 1411.42s]  Oh, that's bad. That's really bad. Actually. That's the worst thing that could happen.
[1411.42s -> 1431.85s]  Shit. It's not a total catastrophe yet though. Hold on. Okay. Oh boy. We're good. I could go for
[1431.85s -> 1439.08s]  some pizza right now. Oh, could you? Oh, I'm not, I don't feel like a pizza right now. So you can't
[1439.08s -> 1458.49s]  grab me. Fuck. I think I lost it from last night. Yeah. Yeah. It looks, I don't know if it's gonna.
[1459.45s -> 1465.98s]  Yeah. Yeah. It's lost from last night. Yeah. I lost it. Fucking my headaches getting so much worse.
[1467.22s -> 1471.46s]  Why can't I just replace my brain with like a digital fucking computer at this point?
[1472.92s -> 1480.54s]  Like why? We want, everyone wants self-driving cars. No, I want a self-driving brain.
[1494.44s -> 1504.66s]  What? Digital computer. LOL. Yeah. I want a digital computer brain. It's on its way.
[1509.56s -> 1520.42s]  Shit. Okay. Come on. Give me back up to there. Too much. Way too fucking much. That's a tiny jump.
[1520.42s -> 1534.22s]  No. Forced updates. Yeah. I'd rather have, I'd rather have like a digitized brain.
[1535.02s -> 1547.59s]  That's better. Don't go too hard. All right. Slowly but surely climbing back up to where I was.
[1548.23s -> 1564.06s]  I don't know why. Just jump over though. Just jump over. Fuck.
[1571.11s -> 1580.68s]  Damn it. I'm telling you it's those 5G signals. I also have a doctor's appointment tomorrow too.
[1581.40s -> 1597.19s]  I'm bringing this shit up. No, no. Not the, not the digitized computer brain.
[1599.90s -> 1604.38s]  Hey doc. I've got something to tell you. You know, like when do, when are we going to have medical
[1604.38s -> 1613.40s]  procedures where I can replace my brain with a computer? That's not what I'm talking about.
[1617.59s -> 1646.38s]  All right. Back up. We go. Oh yeah. Okay. Hope it goes well. Me too. Me too. Easy does it.
[1655.29s -> 1673.75s]  Easy does it. Oh, I made it back. Well, not I haven't not yet. Okay. Good. Same deal. Get back up here.
[1678.84s -> 1684.46s]  Oh, come on man. Sorry to hear that you're being, you're being put down tomorrow.
[1688.46s -> 1691.42s]  If anything I can say about this stream, I'm so glad I got to tell you about that dream.
[1695.38s -> 1714.70s]  Seriously. I'm so glad you guys got to hear it. Too much. Oops. Okay. All right. I made it back.
[1715.34s -> 1727.53s]  A little too much, but it's all right. Oh, I almost didn't make it. Oh, way too fucking much.
[1727.53s -> 1757.00s]  Way too much. Shit. This is bad. What do I do about this? Oh, fuck. There we go. Oh man. What the
[1757.00s -> 1773.98s]  fuck was that? Get on there. Please. I'm begging you. It's so easy. No, no. I'll fall all the way
[1773.98s -> 1787.61s]  down. I don't want to fall all the way down. Holy fuck. All right. Now we go this way. I'm ready.
[1787.61s -> 1813.14s]  Here we go. That jump is fucking insane. But all right. If I go, if I go left instead, can I make,
[1813.14s -> 1822.65s]  can I make that with a full jump? I'm not sure I can. Can I? No, I have to get this one, right?
[1827.45s -> 1858.97s]  Man, that sucks. That's so hard. That jump sucks. Jump King sucks. Okay. So I've, I've overshot that
[1858.97s -> 1865.93s]  jump two times, right? So it's lighter than that, but fuck man. It's so hard to judge.
[1866.65s -> 1902.14s]  Maybe before this was a 12 hour stream. No, no way. Not a chance. All right. Here we go.
[1902.14s -> 1921.75s]  Got it. Boys and girls, we've made it to this next section. All right. Now what? What? Over,
[1921.75s -> 1933.82s]  wait, over there? Okay. Underburg. There's wind now. Oh God. There's wind. Shit.
[1936.87s -> 1947.34s]  Hmm. It's not that strong though. Is it? I wonder, can I, should I jump from all the way to the left
[1948.28s -> 1966.42s]  with the wind? I'm scared. Okay. I think I can just jump up and it'll take me, right? All right. Yeah.
[1966.42s -> 1982.41s]  I didn't know how strong it was. Oh my God. This sucks. This sucks. Oh man. Okay. Slow down.
[1982.97s -> 2000.62s]  I could jump up a little, but then guys, I have to, all the way to the left is not safe.
[2001.26s -> 2033.88s]  What the fuck was I thinking? Shit. Now I'm back here again. Damn it. It's okay. Oh,
[2055.54s -> 2098.42s]  no. God, it's so hard. No, it's so hard. And if you fall, you're fucked. It's the anxiety of
[2099.22s -> 2101.70s]  being so scared that you're going to miss it and go all the way down.
[2113.21s -> 2139.13s]  Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Oh shit. Oh shit. Um, uh, I was on it. What the fuck just happened?
[2139.13s -> 2161.08s]  Slow down. I thought I missed it. Let me get up here and see what the hell this even is all about.
[2161.08s -> 2182.17s]  Let's get, okay. Um, yeah. Full jump to the left into the wind or full jump to the left with the
[2182.17s -> 2188.98s]  wind. I don't know if that's a good idea. Full left with the wind. I'm going to soar over this.
[2188.98s -> 2225.58s]  Hopefully this isn't up top maybe. Ah, shit. Okay. Don't, Jeremy. Oh my God. I hate this part.
[2226.46s -> 2238.41s]  It's freaking me the fuck out. Jump King and chill. Jump King and increase headache.
[2239.53s -> 2258.46s]  Why would you don't, why'd you tell me to do that? I was a full jump left. Can you see the wall?
[2258.46s -> 2265.45s]  What are you doing? What do you mean the wall? Yeah. I, I, I'm scared to do a full jump left.
[2266.57s -> 2276.25s]  I'm going to soar over the whole damn thing. All right. I'm going for it. Yeah. I know. I can see
[2276.25s -> 2279.93s]  the pole. I'm just talking about if I do a full left, I'm going to soar the fuck over the whole
[2279.93s -> 2308.62s]  thing. Fucking wind. I swear to God. All right. Here we go. Oh my fucking God guys. No, it didn't
[2308.62s -> 2355.29s]  work. Oh fuck. Oh, get back up there. You got to go softer than that. Very soft. Not very soft,
[2355.29s -> 2374.07s]  but shit. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. What's up here?
[2374.07s -> 2381.51s]  I'm scared to jump up there. Fold to the right with the wind. Full right with wind.
[2383.80s -> 2393.11s]  Oh, I don't have time to jump and check. Oh, I had to check. I had to check, man. I don't know
[2393.11s -> 2425.11s]  what's up there. I couldn't, I didn't even see what was up there either. God damn it. I'm going
[2425.11s -> 2431.85s]  for it. I'm just jumping up with the wind. Holy shit. Okay. I was supposed to do that. All right.
[2431.85s -> 2446.92s]  Now. Oh fuck. All right. Now. Um, okay. There's two ways to go. I could try right or just,
[2454.26s -> 2465.90s]  oh my God, damn it. Fucking Jesus Christ. I just, I didn't, uh, what just happened?
[2465.90s -> 2470.22s]  Glag. My controller unfucking plugged. Plug it back in. Plug it back in. Plug it back in. Plug
[2470.22s -> 2480.81s]  it back in. Plug it back in. What the fuck? Are you serious? I am so mad right now. You've got to be
[2480.81s -> 2492.79s]  fucking kidding me. What? I, it was plugged in the whole time. Ah, that's so stupid.
[2493.43s -> 2520.87s]  Fall right with the wind. I can't fucking believe that shit. Holy fuck, dude. Okay.
[2520.87s -> 2544.86s]  If you stand still, the wind doesn't, ow, my head. Oh yeah. Wait, I'm, oh, oh, I'm inside of a
[2544.86s -> 2550.86s]  building. I'm inside of the, I'm inside of a building. Okay. I'm inside of a building.
[2551.74s -> 2585.14s]  Don't you dare. What the fuck just happened? You fucking idiot. I got to jump in the air and let
[2585.14s -> 2626.86s]  it, ah, now I have to get across. Okay. Oh, I do. Oh my God. I think I have to jump straight in the
[2626.86s -> 2672.44s]  air. Okay. Oh shit. Oh God. No, no. Oh my God. It's so fucking stressful. I'll get it. I have to
[2672.44s -> 2697.26s]  jump a little higher. Now what? I can't see. Holy fuck me. Okay. And there? Holy shit.
[2697.82s -> 2723.32s]  Hello. This is my room. I'm getting tired just looking at you. Can you please leave? My fucking
[2723.32s -> 2746.36s]  God. Now what? Jump up straight in the air and carry to the left. The wind is getting inside,
[2747.56s -> 2771.88s]  but it's too much work to seal the entrance. No, I do know. Uh, where? Middle? Right into the middle?
[2771.88s -> 2781.96s]  But wouldn't that drop me down? I see over on the right, but how do I get into that room?
[2789.59s -> 2795.11s]  I don't want to go in the middle. That room on the right. I can't make that jump. Do I have to slide
[2795.11s -> 2826.02s]  off of the right side? Nope. Oh fuck. Oh my God. Where am I? What the fuck? Stop. Oh,
[2827.74s -> 2852.09s]  oh, this sucks. I don't understand. I'm in, I'm fucking, I'm screwed. And then it's full right
[2852.09s -> 2878.34s]  with the wind. Okay. I almost just missed it. So the middle, I, that's the middle right there.
[2878.34s -> 2883.05s]  You do know, you do have to go in the middle, huh? Shit. I have to go in the middle.
[2898.70s -> 2919.03s]  Fuck. What was I doing? Oh my God. I just like closed my eyes for a second. That just like hurt.
[2921.96s -> 2930.10s]  Oh my God. Try pick toe picks. No, I, uh, this sucks, but I'm going to have to turn my stream
[2930.10s -> 2938.62s]  off soon. Like the left side of my head through my eye. What a pain in the ass. What a pain in
[2938.62s -> 2948.17s]  the ass. I really don't want to, but fuck. And I have the doctor's appointment tomorrow.
[2948.73s -> 2966.31s]  Sorry. What was after this? Oh my fuck. Okay. Jump to what? Maybe jumping wasn't the smartest idea.
[2966.87s -> 2977.48s]  Uh, it don't matter. It was going to creep up on me anyways. Oops. Too much. You've been stressed
[2977.48s -> 2984.86s]  all stream. Well, no, not really. I'm all right. Just, it just hurts way too much again. Really?
[2984.86s -> 3001.80s]  That was like half the power. There it is. All right. Get me up here and I'm just going for it.
[3001.80s -> 3014.02s]  I'm going for it right now. I did it. I did it. I actually did it. Now what? Um, should I go down?
[3014.74s -> 3026.18s]  Oh shit. Hi. Hi. I need to do a little jump with a tiny jump with the wind because look at that
[3026.18s -> 3034.49s]  ceiling. Oh my God. Needed to be more than that. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. I'm going home. Oh no. This is
[3034.49s -> 3042.54s]  bad. Oh, this is really bad. This is game over. This is stream over. If I fall down even more,
[3042.54s -> 3062.04s]  this is stream over. Oh yeah. I haven't done this in a long time. Oh fuck. Oh well. It ain't over
[3062.04s -> 3083.42s]  yet. Not yet. It's still, I haven't fallen down too crazy yet. Too much. Oh bye bye. See you later.
[3083.42s -> 3091.45s]  I'll see you guys later. Nope. Not yet. I thought I was going all the way.
[3097.30s -> 3112.28s]  Munker Omega. I, I don't even know what that symbol is. How, how much power was that shit? What
[3128.60s -> 3160.46s]  fucking power are you doing? What the fuck? Fucking give me him. Easy with the power. Slow it down.
[3176.30s -> 3206.38s]  All right. All right. I'm good. End of the Jump King voice. Yeah. I don't know if I can handle it.
[3207.24s -> 3212.28s]  I knew that I was going to get crept up on. It happened a lot faster than I thought it was.
[3212.28s -> 3216.52s]  You know what? I'm just glad that we could play keep talking and nobody explodes
[3217.24s -> 3259.37s]  because that was the plan tonight and fuck me. All right. Oh, God damn it. That jump sucks.
[3259.93s -> 3265.53s]  That jump fucking sucks. That jump sucks, man. That's the worst jump.
[3292.34s -> 3296.31s]  Yeah. All right. We're getting, we're getting to critical eye headache.
[3296.31s -> 3304.09s]  It's critical. Yeah. It's critical right now. Oh yeah. It's over. It's over. We're at critical
[3304.09s -> 3323.45s]  headache. I think I'm going all the way down. All right. I'm going to try this one more time.
[3323.45s -> 3329.85s]  Oh my God. And I, I, I, do I have like a fever? What's going on? Am I like, fuck my body temperature
[3329.85s -> 3336.84s]  feels like it's like 5,000 degrees. Like what is going on? Oh, it's cause there's a bunch of
[3336.84s -> 3347.77s]  lights in here. That's why he's, he's dying. No, I'm not. I'm fine. All right. This is it. Last.
[3347.77s -> 3402.98s]  No, no, no. Last temp writer. If I fall down one screen streams over. Let's go. Let's do it. What
[3402.98s -> 3410.97s]  just happened? Okay. I think Mike, the controller fucking unplugged again. I fixed this shit already.
[3414.17s -> 3431.88s]  I fixed this controller like a month ago. That's a sign from God. Not yet. Pull right with the wind.
[3431.88s -> 3485.14s]  Here we go. I gotta go a little harder than that. Go get some rest. I will. Don't worry. So I,
[3485.78s -> 3489.54s]  and another thing too, this is why I was like, fuck, I don't want to stream for like two hours
[3489.54s -> 3492.98s]  today. Uh, there's no stream tomorrow because I have a doctor's appointment. That's going to
[3492.98s -> 3504.41s]  last a while. So I will not be streaming tomorrow, but I will continue the day after that.
[3505.21s -> 3508.25s]  And we'll probably, you know, we're probably gonna start Katana zero. We'll just do it.
[3509.29s -> 3525.80s]  That's like a five hour game, right? I just want to get up there and try one more time.
[3527.08s -> 3531.16s]  No, I just want to try again. I just want to save a checkpoint up here so I can,
[3531.16s -> 3548.66s]  oh, it's not fair or Kingsway Kingsway looks fun too. Oh my fucking God, Jeremy. What's Kingsway?
[3548.66s -> 3555.34s]  It's like a weird web browser, RPG pop-up window thing. It looks really, really interesting.
[3566.15s -> 3571.53s]  All right. Next attempt. Here we go. I gotta be a little bit harder.
[3571.53s -> 3597.88s]  Not too hard though with the wind. All right. Okay. Harder than that. I gotta wait. What's up
[3597.88s -> 3619.00s]  here? Oh my fuck. Oh my God. No, no, no, no. My God. Where am I? Where the fuck is my character?
[3625.51s -> 3643.40s]  No, you stop. All right. Last attempt and I actually have to leave. He's actually crying.
[3645.72s -> 3660.97s]  I just wanted to fucking be joking too much. Way too much. All right. Goodbye.
[3661.77s -> 3666.49s]  I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm saving everything. I'll pick it up another day.
[3666.49s -> 3679.93s]  All right. I gotta go. That's a fun game. It's fun. It's a fun game. I just, my fucking head is
[3679.93s -> 3687.05s]  on fire. So I hate fucking headaches more than anything. I would rather, I would rather shit my
[3687.05s -> 3692.57s]  pants on stream and sit in it than have a migraine on stream because one of them you wouldn't even,
[3692.57s -> 3697.35s]  you wouldn't even know happened. I would rather shit my pants and sit here in it. Like seriously,
[3697.35s -> 3706.98s]  I would then have a fucking migraine. But anyways, I'll see you guys again on Tuesday.
[3707.78s -> 3713.77s]  As of Tuesday, we'll probably go, we'll do at least two, three days in a row as of Tuesday,
[3713.77s -> 3716.89s]  because we did two days one day. We'll do two, three days in a row. Yeah, makes sense.
[3718.39s -> 3736.17s]  Either Katana Zero Kingsway or, or Heroes 2. Let's start that. Or a GameCube game. I don't know.
[3739.10s -> 3743.82s]  We'll see. Katana Zero. Yeah, we'll see. All right guys. I'm going to go through the bits.
[3744.62s -> 3749.26s]  It shouldn't take us too long. Thank you so much for watching. The earlier that was a lot of fun.
[3749.26s -> 3754.14s]  I got, I did some progress in Jump King 2. Keep Talking to Nobody Explodes was actually really
[3754.14s -> 3759.66s]  fun. That was, it was just all over the place. It's exactly what I thought was going to happen.
[3760.86s -> 3767.42s]  I guess we'll do that again and switch roles and see if we can do it. Am I going to do yesterday's
[3767.42s -> 3772.62s]  bits too? Oh wait, that's right. Fuck that, because I got cut off. I might not be able to
[3772.62s -> 3779.22s]  sit here for that long, unfortunately. Let me see. How many are, how many were there?
[3780.79s -> 3784.07s]  I'm sorry. I'm just going to be real. Let's see how many there were.
[3787.50s -> 3809.26s]  Because there's like a knife in my head right now. Let's see. From. Let's restore.
[3809.26s -> 3821.02s]  Yeah, I, I'm sorry guys. I can't sit here for this long. I wish I could. I really do.
[3824.47s -> 3832.04s]  He's currently getting a lobotomy. I will, I will do these when I come back though. And they're
[3832.04s -> 3836.84s]  going to be very irrelevant, but I don't want to just blow them off. Blame fucking shitty
[3836.84s -> 3845.32s]  internet yesterday. We'll do it. I promise. I just, I can't do it right now. I can get through
[3845.32s -> 3853.67s]  the ones from today because there's only about five or six of them. I do apologize though,
[3853.67s -> 3857.91s]  seriously, but I'll see you guys on Tuesday for those of you taking off. If you want to stick
[3857.91s -> 3863.43s]  around for the last bits of the stream here before I get out of here and like dunk my head in cold
[3863.43s -> 3877.54s]  water. I'll see you soon. Put this. Just do both next time. No, there's really only like six,
[3877.54s -> 3880.90s]  I think there's like six or seven here. Yeah, there's not very many. This won't take very long.
[3881.94s -> 3893.56s]  So earlier we had, we had a thousand bits from SSJ Mac. Thank you, Mac. Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[3893.56s -> 3896.92s]  Hey, German, thanks for making me laugh for like seven years. When are you going to bring back the
[3896.92s -> 3914.09s]  coffee commentary of justice and doom? Oh, I remember those. Probably never. That's just
[3914.09s -> 3920.06s]  every stream now. Thank you for the thousand bits though. Appreciate it. Sam of the freelance police,
[3920.06s -> 3924.46s]  thanks for the 500 bits. Hey German, happy 2020. You've been a constant companion for most of the
[3924.46s -> 3930.38s]  past decade. Hope this continues into this decade. I go to university abroad and your streams always
[3930.38s -> 3938.74s]  make me feel cozy and less alone. Please go back to the EU friendly schedule. I'm happy to be a
[3940.65s -> 3946.23s]  voice that you recognize and a voice that you are used to. That can either be in the background or
[3946.87s -> 3949.67s]  if you're completely attentive to everything going on in the stream.
[3950.87s -> 3957.30s]  Thank you so much for the support. And yes, I will be going back to one between one and
[3957.30s -> 3961.62s]  two PM Pacific starting in the next couple of weeks. I will make sure I let you know,
[3962.58s -> 3965.38s]  but I do want to get back on that. It was just a couple of things made it so I couldn't.
[3966.42s -> 3971.88s]  But yeah, thank you for the 500 bits. Nile Orion, thanks for the 300 bits. German is the Chris
[3971.88s -> 3985.00s]  Jericho of streaming. Wow. Effectator, thanks for the 250. German, you don't understand. I actually
[3985.00s -> 3991.32s]  obsessed over the bomb game last year. I learned Morse code just for the bomb diffusal and got to
[3991.32s -> 4000.17s]  the point where I could diffuse the first one before the lights came on. What? Oh my fucking God.
[4004.18s -> 4007.38s]  How do you do that before? How is that even possible? Don't the lights turn on when you
[4008.70s -> 4018.41s]  hold on? I'm confused. Oh, look at this. How don't the lights come on when you touch the
[4018.41s -> 4037.93s]  bomb? See what I'm saying? I thought when you touch it, the lights turn on. There's a brief
[4037.93s -> 4049.66s]  second of delay. Jesus. Yeah. So watching this stream, you must have been sitting there going,
[4051.06s -> 4058.65s]  I could do this shit in my sleep. Thank you though. We'll get better. We'll get better.
[4058.65s -> 4063.21s]  We'll get better. Morning Maple, thanks for the 300 bits. Mutilated man for next German rumble.
[4063.21s -> 4067.45s]  Make him have a floppy intestine dangling. I don't even know what I just read. I shoot. Was
[4067.45s -> 4071.53s]  that, was that a bad thing? I don't know what that I just read. Um, I don't know what that was.
[4073.70s -> 4076.42s]  But I don't know about that. Thanks for the 300 bits. Morning Maple.
[4076.98s -> 4080.34s]  Freudian weapon, thanks for 250. What the hell are you eating before bed that's giving you those
[4080.34s -> 4090.23s]  kind of dreams? Not anything ridiculous. Oh, from your dream. Oh, right, right, right.
[4093.99s -> 4099.99s]  I'm okay. I want to copy and paste all the text I've punched into the iPad because it is delirious.
[4101.51s -> 4107.96s]  I wrote it so quickly. I have to like pull that over here. I'll do that like in a couple of days.
[4107.96s -> 4116.15s]  I'll show you. But thank you Freudian for the 250. Also thank you to Cookieinva for the 500 bits. Hey
[4116.15s -> 4120.47s]  Jerma, my girlfriend recently ended our four-year relationship because she doesn't love me anymore.
[4120.47s -> 4125.51s]  I'm pretty down and you helped me so much. I met your YouTube channel in the old days
[4126.15s -> 4133.85s]  and though I can't sleep, I got to finally catch a stream live of yours. Sorry to hear that it's a
[4133.85s -> 4143.08s]  long time. Four years is a significant time and a relationship. But the one thing you can bring from
[4143.08s -> 4150.02s]  that that's positive, that really is positive is when you date somebody for that long and it
[4150.02s -> 4157.18s]  doesn't work out, just I guess be look on the bright side of if it lasted like another few years,
[4158.14s -> 4165.82s]  you know, then you're talking five, six, seven years. It's a lot longer and it's a lot more to
[4165.82s -> 4171.16s]  process. Four years is a long time but I am certain that you'll find somebody else
[4175.21s -> 4183.62s]  and it wasn't meant to be. That's all you can take from it is just know that it was not meant to be.
[4185.19s -> 4203.40s]  Eventually it will be to be. Much love to you though. Using somebody to teach math? What do you
[4203.40s -> 4214.70s]  mean that? What? Let's get the credits on here. Roll them. Short stream. We'll see you Tuesday.
[4215.42s -> 4222.55s]  Thanks everybody. Even if you subbed over the course of this almost just barely three hours
[4222.55s -> 4229.35s]  stream. It's a little one's compact money. Yeah it is. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
[4229.35s -> 4232.79s]  Tomorrow the doctor's appointment actually is something I'm really looking forward to because
[4232.79s -> 4237.75s]  it is with a new doctor that we're gonna start to talk about what I'm gonna do
[4238.71s -> 4246.30s]  about my rib cage problem and my hernia. So I'm... this is an appointment I've been looking forward
[4246.30s -> 4260.07s]  to so I do not want to miss it. But thank you all of you. Hey Jamie, thanks for the 500 bits Jamie.
[4260.07s -> 4265.19s]  You could do a chill pottery stream sometime to show the pottery training you did for bugleberry
[4265.19s -> 4273.91s]  so it doesn't go to waste. Yeah it's uh it didn't take that much time. It took like three weeks to
[4274.07s -> 4280.47s]  get that stream set up. The whole thing. But the pottery it was it was like four or five hours.
[4280.47s -> 4286.87s]  Like four and a half hours total of classes. So it's not like I spent months or weeks preparing
[4286.87s -> 4300.58s]  for it. Do it anyways. You lied again. No I said it took away. When did I say I did three weeks of
[4300.58s -> 4307.38s]  pottery lessons? Oh wait maybe I did just maybe I was just fucking around. I mean I took pottery
[4307.38s -> 4317.96s]  lessons and it was like five hours of classes. Oh he's backtracking. Is that a lie? No I
[4318.04s -> 4327.48s]  didn't I say it took three weeks to get that already? Maybe I did lie. I don't think I did.
[4327.48s -> 4332.04s]  Hey grandpa pissed thanks for the 250. Just wonder what happened to the previous 984 germas?
[4332.92s -> 4340.26s]  Well the first like 200 were mixed up into a pot of uh fucking liquid and the 200th one
[4340.26s -> 4348.22s]  201st one drank them. Got all the power. Um I guess I don't know what else you want me to say.
[4348.54s -> 4355.19s]  Oh yeah that's right I'll show I'll show the cake Mario thing before I leave.
[4355.83s -> 4364.28s]  But thank you uh grandpa piss. Thank you Pablo for 500 bits. Happy 40 months nerd. That's a very
[4364.28s -> 4370.04s]  long time. I have to do new bit badges and sub badges. I gotta get on some of this shit for 2020.
[4370.76s -> 4377.83s]  I will I promise. I will get them done. Thank you for the 40 continuous months of supporting this
[4377.83s -> 4383.80s]  stream. Jesus. Gore grinder thanks for 300 bits. Uh I hope your appointment goes well tomorrow.
[4383.80s -> 4389.50s]  Thanks for a bomb ass stream. Thank you for being here. Thanks for watching. I do too. Hope it goes
[4389.50s -> 4397.86s]  well. The PC Int thanks for 300 bits. Hey germa I had a massive migraine two days in a row and lost
[4397.86s -> 4401.70s]  both days sleeping to try and get rid of it. Both days you cheered me up and made me feel so much
[4401.70s -> 4406.50s]  better being there streaming when I woke up and felt better. I appreciate that. I gave bits yesterday
[4406.50s -> 4414.14s]  but I don't know if you read them yet. I want you to say my name lol. It's Dejen. Dejen. Thank you
[4414.14s -> 4420.78s]  Dejen. And yeah migraines are the worst especially the worst migraines can just come on you and
[4421.74s -> 4426.06s]  there's nothing you can do. Even if you take Tylenol or Advil it just doesn't work.
[4426.78s -> 4435.19s]  It's just it's like a different kind of headache. It's such a pain in the ass. But yeah they are
[4435.19s -> 4444.39s]  the worst. Thank you for the 300 bits though. Appreciate it. Bdlujay thanks for the 500 bits.
[4445.19s -> 4449.67s]  I was in a discord chat with my friends while watching. Yo shout out to Alex and Keifer.
[4449.67s -> 4453.43s]  And we all had a blast seeing you and Joel yell at each other like idiots and also play
[4453.43s -> 4457.59s]  Jump King like a pro. I'm all right. Thanks for the laughs as usual. You always brighten my day.
[4457.59s -> 4467.59s]  Love you germa. Thank you. Thank you so much. You guys hanging out in a in a Skype call and just
[4467.67s -> 4474.20s]  fucking I love that. That makes me happy. Excedrin is good for migraines. Yeah doesn't
[4474.20s -> 4478.66s]  Excedrin have a shitload of caffeine in it though? And I take in a lot of caffeine anyways.
[4479.22s -> 4488.12s]  No it's just being a dark room and keep my eyes closed pretty much is how I get rid of them.
[4488.76s -> 4494.02s]  Thankfully they don't happen that much anymore. I think realistically only a few streams over
[4494.02s -> 4499.54s]  the last year have really been shut off from a migraine so that's pretty good. I'm just happy
[4499.54s -> 4505.26s]  about that. Doesn't happen all the time. Thank you 90hoo for the 500 bits. I made you a gift
[4505.26s -> 4520.33s]  of pizza before you go deep rain. No that's not it. Pepperoni pizza. Yeah he almost got me there.
[4521.13s -> 4531.91s]  He kept saying the word pizza and pepperonis and stuff and then I almost left. What'd you do to my
[4531.91s -> 4538.44s]  mouth? Why is my mouth so strange looking? Dobski dude thanks for the 250. I want to make a formal
[4538.44s -> 4543.56s]  apology. A week ago I tried contributing to the giant enemy spider meme but in the process I
[4543.56s -> 4548.92s]  accidentally brought the trick to you flog pyro joke back from the dead. It's already spiraling
[4548.92s -> 4554.84s]  out of control. Even Vinny is getting hit with the clip out of context. Now we have not one but two
[4554.84s -> 4563.00s]  five-year-old germa jokes running amok. Help one day chat can forgive me. Yeah this is rising of
[4563.00s -> 4576.90s]  the dead here. This is the second one. He probably just is like what the fuck is this? And that's it
[4576.90s -> 4585.46s]  guys. I will see you on Tuesday. Again sorry for the abrupt short stream that just turned off
[4586.18s -> 4593.34s]  but you know you do what you gotta do and I gotta do this. Thank you all again so much for your
[4593.34s -> 4600.26s]  support and it's Joel streaming right? Let's go say hello to Joel. Let's go Ray Joel.
[4601.72s -> 4612.12s]  We were playing with Joel earlier so yeah he's still going. He's doing Zelda Ocarina of Half-Life.

[4624.12s -> 4631.61s]  my headache. See like dude I do dude germa had to turn his stream off because of like you gave him

[4718.63s -> 4735.32s]  you think? It's like four versions of Cake Mario. It's ugly? What? What do you mean it's ugly as shit?
[4736.04s -> 4745.29s]  Who said that? That's not true. Is it? It's going to my bathroom. It's going right above my toilet.
[4749.29s -> 4753.61s]  It's going right into the toilet. Well not right above. It's going right above the toilet.
[4757.82s -> 4761.74s]  All right I'll see you guys on Tuesday. Let's uh let's raid Joel.
