[1.59s -> 6.49s]  All right, convinced myself of something very recently here right now.
[7.69s -> 15.40s]  I'm certain, you know a cow has four stomachs. I've never had an x-ray before on my, you know,
[15.40s -> 20.44s]  bladder. I bet you I have three or four bladders. Some kind of genetic mutation.
[23.85s -> 35.78s]  Well everybody's messages are getting deleted. What are you guys doing? All right, let's do it.
[36.42s -> 49.72s]  Create skater. Skater one. Site. Name. Who does this- what's this? Because you put like stat points
[49.72s -> 62.44s]  in and shit, don't you? I can't make Thanos right now. It could be me. This is just going
[62.44s -> 86.95s]  to be Jeremy. Why would it be anything else? Enough room? I don't have enough room. This
[86.95s -> 102.86s]  character career is going to take two hours? This- not a very significant amount of things
[102.86s -> 109.35s]  you can do in this character career. Jax Albertson. I got it. That's actually a pretty
[109.35s -> 125.32s]  good idea. Thank you for the suggestion. All right, there is Jax Albertson. My real name.
[129.37s -> 157.93s]  Name. Uh, hometown. I'm gonna spell it like that. Age. Style. All around. Vert. Street. All
[157.93s -> 164.28s]  around. Hmm. Vert I believe is air. Height. Street is being able to jump around. It's
[164.28s -> 168.20s]  grind on shit. And all around is kind of your style is all around. I'm gonna say,
[170.28s -> 176.68s]  uh, no Goofy. Goofy is just, uh, you sitting out the other way. Street is probably better,
[176.68s -> 182.98s]  but I don't know. I think I like all around. Street. Street. Weight. I don't weigh that much.
[184.70s -> 192.81s]  I don't weigh that little- oh my lord. You can literally make a sausage with it. Thank you
[192.81s -> 204.79s]  Herbert for the five community subs. Thanks a lot Herb. Herbert. I'm like- I'm like 154 or
[204.79s -> 214.95s]  something, so that's close enough. I'm not gonna make him a hot dog. Complexion. Uh,
[215.75s -> 225.91s]  let's load everything. Okay, roll easy. Head. Slick. I think that's just Tony Hawk's face.
[227.59s -> 270.06s]  Suck. Suck too. I actually kind of like this one. Striped shirt. Uh, what do I got on
[270.06s -> 287.61s]  right now? I have like a gray shirt on. Camo. Tank top. Jersey. Sweat bands.
[290.33s -> 303.78s]  Three. Sweat bands. Sweatshirt. T-shirt. That's kind of boring. I wear kind- I wear shit like
[303.78s -> 320.22s]  this. I do. No logo. The one I have on right now is gray, but I'll do like a blue.
[322.98s -> 333.93s]  That's all right right there. The same color. Pants. If they have a Star Wars logo pants,
[333.93s -> 340.12s]  I'll do it. If not, I'm just gonna do pair of jeans. Really wear shorts.
[344.02s -> 349.94s]  Uh, regular pants. I'm just gonna make them blue. There we go. Shoes.
[353.82s -> 358.23s]  All right, that's- that's- that looks all right. That's not what I look like though,
[358.23s -> 370.60s]  at all. That- that kind of looks like me. The guy with the helmet on. Or one of these.
[371.72s -> 389.74s]  Maybe. Yeah, that looks like me. Okay, I'm gonna keep the helmet on. You can just pretend
[389.74s -> 396.14s]  I'm bald under there. Whatever. All right, this is important. I've got five points left.
[396.14s -> 404.06s]  This is very important. Hang time. Olly. Speed. Spin. Landing. Switch. Rail. Bail.
[405.26s -> 416.70s]  Lip balance. Rail balance. I need some like- ah, no. Rail balance. I want at least a couple.
[416.70s -> 430.58s]  I love riding manuals as well. Speed. Maybe air as well. Or hang time. That rail balance
[430.58s -> 437.29s]  is so important. All right, that's all right. That's okay. I think that's good. 100% into
[437.29s -> 449.78s]  Olly. I'm gonna get points as I get cash. Is rail balance more important than manuals in the
[449.78s -> 460.92s]  first part of the game? Yeah, you can't take points away. You can just add. I think it's
[460.92s -> 470.17s]  all right. I'm good. I'm good with this. Trick setup. I forgot you could do all this shit.
[470.89s -> 480.66s]  I forgot about this. Up and X. I got no money, but we can. Okay. Inward heel flip.
[482.20s -> 490.18s]  Heel flip. And some of these are worth more points. Yep. Up, up, X. What do we got?
[490.74s -> 501.22s]  Possible varial kick flip. Let's put this on. Do I have any? No, I have varial heel flip.
[502.18s -> 504.50s]  No varial kick flip, though. No, actually, I already do.
[507.18s -> 511.34s]  All these cost money. Hard flip. No, I still, I think I pretty much I have
[512.30s -> 520.42s]  everything. You can buy shit. Let's see. Inward heel flip, varial, X shove it, kick flip,
[520.42s -> 527.61s]  hard flip. Flip all the way north. Inward heel flip. Yeah, I gotta buy these.
[528.57s -> 535.38s]  There's the mute, the whole other mute. Got a stale fish. Indy, stiffy, crossbone.
[536.26s -> 563.21s]  Close beef. Grab. Grab tricks. Yeah, actually, that's really not. These are the grabs.
[565.70s -> 574.07s]  Up, up, and B. These are, we're getting into the, not necessarily, they're not that important.
[574.95s -> 583.16s]  Lip tricks. Yeah, nose stall. Disaster. What else is there? Something else.
[584.76s -> 593.22s]  Specials. Now, this is important. Dark slide. Can't do it? Oh, it's already assigned.
[598.18s -> 609.42s]  Right down B is kick, flip, kick, twist. Up, up, 540 flip. Bang, bang. Okay, I gotta remember
[609.42s -> 617.69s]  this one. Left, right. Left, right, grind, dark slide. All right, well, we'll just go.
[617.69s -> 621.69s]  Let's get, let's just get it going. I'm ready. Oh, let me just crack open.
[622.65s -> 631.06s]  You can only pick tricks that you can do in real life. Well, then I wouldn't even stand
[631.06s -> 641.62s]  on the skateboard. These are all just dog shit boards. I can't afford anything else.
[641.62s -> 649.72s]  Save skater into career file. Yes. What am I drinking? This is a, it's a Coca Cola.
[649.72s -> 664.47s]  It's just a Coke. What the hell was that? No, this is my VMU. Career mode. New career.
[670.36s -> 674.33s]  There he is. Jax Alberton. Let's see how bad he is compared to everybody else.
[675.29s -> 681.26s]  It's not bad actually. I mean, yeah, everybody else is more balanced, but
[682.30s -> 688.60s]  let's do it. Buy stats, buy tricks, skate shop. All right, he did all that.
[689.64s -> 700.60s]  Let's go. This is the hanger. Mullet Falls. Minnesota, Kentucky. So the goals here.
[701.56s -> 709.24s]  What do we got? Get a high score of 10,000, 25,000, and 75,000. Let's skate.
[710.20s -> 718.79s]  The nose grind over the pipe. Hit the hang time gaps. Secret tape. 100% goals. Let's just go for
[718.79s -> 724.97s]  points. You kind of have to do these in sessions because they're timed. And let's like try to
[724.97s -> 732.94s]  remember how to play this video game. Let's go. Welcome to Tony Hawk 2 for the Sega Dreamcast.
[742.74s -> 764.10s]  RIP Vaude. Oh, first fall. Manuals. Oh my God. I forgot how great this was.
[764.82s -> 775.58s]  I'm going to just get used to the controls. Is there no uh, is there no bar
[780.09s -> 800.28s]  for when you're on the reel? I just thought there was. It's been so long. Turn it up.
[801.00s -> 810.10s]  All right, I'll turn it up. Sound levels. Music. That's good.
[822.42s -> 834.22s]  Oh yeah, I'm feeling it. I'm feeling it. One thing I gotta remember how to do
[836.49s -> 875.29s]  whole jumping. Yeah. That was perfect somehow. So what did I get in my in my tutorial run?
[876.41s -> 888.86s]  So I gotta work on jump speed. Definitely. So high score, high score. So maybe you're
[888.86s -> 895.48s]  noticing my ollie and my air. That needs a little work. Let's go for 75,000. I'll get it.
[895.80s -> 909.74s]  Okay. Audio delay on the PlayStation. On me or the PlayStation 2?
[911.66s -> 919.54s]  Dreamcast. Retried. That's the best part about Tony Hawk is you can just do it again
[920.65s -> 953.00s]  right now. Oops. I gotta get used to the uh, here it is. You got the multiplier up there.
[966.89s -> 973.29s]  Dark slide. Tony Hawk is fucking back in town baby.
[973.29s -> 990.58s]  Wait. No. Just wait till I get like a couple of hours in here, man. I'm gonna be fucking
[990.58s -> 1022.82s]  rubbing. Shit. Oh god damn it. I'm so happy. I got the barrels at least. I can't hold on to
[1022.82s -> 1050.18s]  the lip for long. I'm just a bum. Got it. Dammit. No. Oh, you can keep this. You can
[1050.18s -> 1088.54s]  keep it going. Do it again. One hang time. Get the barrels too. Shit. I need enough points.
[1103.64s -> 1107.32s]  By the way, this is not going to be a very talky game because I've got to concentrate.
[1113.75s -> 1131.78s]  Daisy. One thing I'm trying to get used to is when you jump off, usually you can as you
[1131.78s -> 1135.94s]  jump off and do another trick even more easily. I can grind it because it's like I'm tripping.
[1153.59s -> 1155.27s]  That's how you like string together shit real well.
[1158.71s -> 1169.61s]  One fifth of the way to a million. Yeah. That ain't gonna happen anytime soon.
[1172.81s -> 1196.58s]  Like almost a tenth of the way to a million. You got to get it like started immediately.
[1199.35s -> 1204.52s]  There it is. This is the song. This is the song. You know, it also is just stats too.
[1207.24s -> 1217.34s]  Stats too low to do anything crazy. Just got to work on just doing it. Forget about
[1217.34s -> 1235.29s]  stringing points together. Just get them in the kind of normal. Oh, what was I thinking?
[1236.17s -> 1262.73s]  All right. I'm so obsessed. Shit. All right. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I got, I don't, I don't have
[1262.73s -> 1267.21s]  enough points yet. Just do it the normal way. Jeremy, you can't string things together with
[1267.21s -> 1296.28s]  three points in one. Fuck. You know what I'm saying? Let's go. Thanks so much.
[1297.56s -> 1312.36s]  Oh, you know what it is? There is, I don't have one set to up. Okay.
[1313.40s -> 1326.54s]  Damn it. Okay. No, no, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[1326.54s -> 1334.62s]  I don't have anything set to up X. The tricks would reset.
[1407.45s -> 1426.87s]  Get it. Oh, I didn't get it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I love the hang time.
[1426.87s -> 1441.88s]  I should have done more hang time. Grab the edge there. I got the points.
[1443.00s -> 1468.01s]  Okay. I got it. One 10th of the way to a million. Sound is not synced. Let me see.
[1468.73s -> 1482.22s]  The sound is happening too early. See if that helps. This is on PlayStation 2. Yes.
[1483.18s -> 1491.80s]  But this is the best version of Tony Hawk. This is the most, this is the most polished
[1499.08s -> 1509.10s]  Oh, did I get it? I got it. Let's go with the, uh, I don't, let's get the barrel.
[1509.74s -> 1596.74s]  Wait, I can go across there. Holding up. There it is. Okay. Secret tape. Barrels. That's it.
[1603.11s -> 1616.81s]  Not quite. No, I got them, didn't I? I got the tape. No, I didn't get it.
[1618.82s -> 1626.68s]  You open school to the best map across the entire series. But we're not, I want to,
[1626.68s -> 1636.25s]  let's look at one, one place at a time. There was a string from school two a long time ago
[1636.25s -> 1641.93s]  that I used to be able to do. Starts at that first staircase going down. You go down,
[1641.93s -> 1647.61s]  you jump on the two benches on the left side. You can string together a million fucking points
[1647.61s -> 1666.68s]  in school two. It's the best map in all Tony Hawk. I need pilot wings and skate. Okay. Yes.
[1667.48s -> 1668.97s]  Flames.
[1672.41s -> 1675.56s]  There's a secret in there, a secret up top too.
[1693.11s -> 1693.99s]  E is up there.
[1697.35s -> 1703.83s]  Got it. Hold L and R in the air to even out.
[1714.26s -> 1716.02s]  L and R are spinning in the air.
[1723.24s -> 1737.18s]  Two more pilot wings. This way. You skate or you die.
[1751.27s -> 1761.67s]  Oh, there it is.
[1763.67s -> 1767.67s]  Got them all.
[1767.67s -> 1769.67s]  I think that's all I can do for now.
[1769.67s -> 1772.07s]  Ain't hot no more.
[1784.98s -> 1795.88s]  Turn the sound effects down. So we got barrel hunt, all the hang time gaps, and nose grind.
[1801.38s -> 1810.47s]  Turn up the effects. Where the sound level? Is the sound level too high? Five, eight, and nine.
[1813.99s -> 1826.26s]  It's not, is it all right? Make sure it's not terrible. Yeah, that's one. Two, I believe,
[1826.26s -> 1839.27s]  across this, didn't have much speed, but okay. That one hits it right here.
[1848.04s -> 1885.51s]  And no. The last one? All right, it's through the wall, right?
[1886.31s -> 1889.91s]  So
[1899.13s -> 1906.97s]  I thought it was the helicopter.
[1919.19s -> 1955.08s]  Remember, you can spend your, yeah, no, not yet. Where's that last jump that I'm missing?
[1956.63s -> 1990.74s]  All right, let's get the barrels. Tony Hawk and Chad?
[1990.74s -> 1998.82s]  This is seriously the best skateboarder game ever.
[1998.82s -> 2005.69s]  I really wish, I really wish you could get another one of these plastic.
[2005.69s -> 2023.67s]  Come on, done.
[2023.67s -> 2031.67s]  As the grind the nose pipe. Which one is that? That's the question. Grind the nose pipe. Up there?
[2031.67s -> 2078.36s]  Oh my god. Great Canadian Fuck Club just came in with 20 more community subs.
[2078.76s -> 2091.94s]  A thousand of them essentially at this point. Thank you, great Canadian, for your $50,000 probably.
[2095.48s -> 2102.18s]  Now that means a lot. Thank you so much. You've given so much money to this channel, man.
[2102.18s -> 2107.38s]  Thank you. Nose grind over the pipe and then we're done.
[2108.18s -> 2126.70s]  Nose grind over the pipe. Over the pipe. This one up here?
[2154.94s -> 2157.69s]  Oh, it's dry.
[2175.05s -> 2180.94s]  100% we did it. Level one complete.
[2180.94s -> 2183.62s]  Let's get a, get a dark slide here.
[2198.30s -> 2200.30s]  That's not it. Left, left, right, right?
[2200.30s -> 2202.30s]  Left, left, right, right?
[2220.73s -> 2226.98s]  That was such a loud noise.
[2234.23s -> 2236.23s]  Wall exploiter.
[2236.23s -> 2258.79s]  Got it all. 100% goals and cash. Wait, I need cash. I mean I don't have to 100% every level.
[2269.61s -> 2292.01s]  The helicopter. There's the cash up top. I need cash up here.
[2294.01s -> 2301.37s]  Wow. I gotta get up. I need a bunch of speed. I need to get up here.
[2303.37s -> 2315.32s]  100 bucks.
[2315.32s -> 2319.67s]  Is there any more money? I think I got all the cash.
[2330.28s -> 2332.46s]  Big bits. Big bits.
[2360.30s -> 2375.14s]  Pellar grind? Grind the propeller grind. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2378.66s -> 2387.69s]  Like the propeller on the plane?
[2387.69s -> 2389.69s]  Okay, on the pipe itself. Half pipe.
[2402.36s -> 2405.24s]  50 bucks. That should be it.
[2409.48s -> 2411.48s]  Oh, there's so much more money in here.
[2411.48s -> 2422.55s]  That was a gnarly wipeout.
[2447.14s -> 2449.14s]  Holy shit, that was so high in the air.
[2449.14s -> 2453.82s]  One more pill right here.
[2453.82s -> 2464.50s]  Going too fast.
[2464.50s -> 2479.34s]  Leveled. No such thing as too fast.
[2484.79s -> 2489.40s]  Now we just free skate for a little bit.
[2491.40s -> 2493.70s]  And then we're gonna buy some points. Maybe a new skateboard.
[2495.70s -> 2511.50s]  I love this game.
[2511.50s -> 2516.94s]  I got 2,500 bucks.
[2516.94s -> 2521.03s]  Save career. Let's go buy some stuff.
[2521.03s -> 2523.03s]  This music makes me feel like I want to punch something.
[2527.00s -> 2531.29s]  So what do you think?
[2531.29s -> 2538.20s]  Do some points?
[2538.20s -> 2541.40s]  Or tricks?
[2541.40s -> 2543.40s]  I'm gonna say stats are probably more important first.
[2543.40s -> 2545.64s]  Points.
[2545.64s -> 2557.16s]  Manuals.
[2557.16s -> 2559.16s]  I mean air.
[2559.16s -> 2569.78s]  Full rail balance.
[2569.78s -> 2590.50s]  Music is so loud.
[2590.50s -> 2592.50s]  I'm sorry.
[2592.50s -> 2596.47s]  Speed.
[2596.47s -> 2598.47s]  All the air and rail balance.
[2598.47s -> 2601.03s]  I think that's pretty good for now.
[2601.03s -> 2604.10s]  Landing also could use it.
[2604.10s -> 2606.10s]  Maybe take one off of all the important landing.
[2606.10s -> 2612.57s]  The rail balance is the most important thing.
[2612.57s -> 2614.57s]  That's how you stay
[2614.57s -> 2616.57s]  moving forward just to string more shit together.
[2616.57s -> 2626.55s]  100% level goal on the hangar.
[2626.55s -> 2628.55s]  Let's move our way to school 2
[2628.55s -> 2630.55s]  in southern California.
[2630.55s -> 2633.88s]  100,000 points.
[2633.88s -> 2635.88s]  Let's skate. Wall ride the bells.
[2635.88s -> 2638.06s]  Ball passes.
[2638.06s -> 2641.32s]  Find secret tape.
[2641.32s -> 2643.82s]  This is where we're probably not gonna 100% everyone.
[2643.82s -> 2647.98s]  I'm willing to give it a try.
[2647.98s -> 2649.98s]  Let's see if I can remember the route.
[2649.98s -> 2651.98s]  To do
[2651.98s -> 2658.76s]  a shitload of points.
[2658.76s -> 2660.76s]  Nobody's made a new skating game because peak skater
[2660.76s -> 2662.76s]  counterculture hasn't had as much traction
[2662.76s -> 2664.76s]  since the Tony Hawk era.
[2664.76s -> 2667.06s]  Yeah that's true but doesn't mean that I don't
[2667.06s -> 2669.06s]  necessarily...
[2669.06s -> 2675.59s]  It's right here. There it is.
[2675.59s -> 2677.59s]  That's how you do it. That's it. Do you see what I'm talking about?
[2677.59s -> 2683.48s]  You go across and you keep going.
[2683.48s -> 2685.48s]  You need more speed though.
[2685.48s -> 2701.54s]  I'm not sure I'll be able to do it.
[2701.54s -> 2703.54s]  That's 50 grand.
[2703.54s -> 2710.90s]  This place really is so awesome.
[2710.90s -> 2720.57s]  There's so much to do here.
[2720.57s -> 2722.57s]  Throw skater. I didn't even do it right.
[2722.57s -> 2728.50s]  I gotta get something on up.
[2728.50s -> 2735.54s]  Up and kickflip.
[2735.54s -> 2739.06s]  That's like one of my favorite ways to grab.
[2739.06s -> 2741.06s]  That rail balance though. That's why we buy...
[2741.06s -> 2754.06s]  That's why we bought it.
[2754.06s -> 2756.06s]  I got some...
[2756.06s -> 2764.70s]  What the hell happened there?
[2764.70s -> 2766.70s]  I need to do it but...
[2766.70s -> 2772.33s]  It's a long ride.
[2772.33s -> 2774.33s]  I'll get the high score right now.
[2774.33s -> 2776.33s]  That's good.
[2776.33s -> 2778.33s]  Try to do the special.
[2778.33s -> 2789.32s]  Oh yeah.
[2789.32s -> 2791.32s]  And then you go across these and you end up across this.
[2791.32s -> 2793.32s]  It's so much. It's amazing.
[2793.32s -> 2803.24s]  The one more try mentality.
[2803.24s -> 2805.86s]  It's so evident here.
[2805.86s -> 2808.55s]  I'm gonna be obsessed with this.
[2808.55s -> 2814.63s]  It's a lot of money too.
[2814.63s -> 2820.20s]  So we need to grab skate.
[2820.20s -> 2822.20s]  Five bells.
[2822.20s -> 2838.90s]  Let's go.
[2859.62s -> 2861.62s]  Come on. Let's go.
[2861.62s -> 2868.15s]  Do it again. I gotta make something up.
[2868.15s -> 2870.15s]  I don't have anything on up or down.
[2870.15s -> 2881.80s]  One more try. Come on.
[2881.80s -> 2885.00s]  I don't think I got it. I think I need some more stats before I can attempt it.
[2885.00s -> 2896.33s]  One more.
[2896.33s -> 2899.34s]  Stop skipping music. I'm just restarting the level.
[2899.34s -> 2914.95s]  Alright. Alright. Come on.
[2914.95s -> 2918.54s]  I'm obsessed.
[2918.54s -> 2925.64s]  I didn't even do it.
[2925.64s -> 2927.64s]  Come on. Why did I not do it?
[2927.64s -> 2929.64s]  I'll do it later.
[2929.64s -> 2931.64s]  I've got no stats.
[2931.64s -> 2938.62s]  Alright. Ride the bells.
[2938.62s -> 2942.97s]  I see one over here.
[2942.97s -> 2955.58s]  Across the dumpster.
[2955.58s -> 2962.49s]  Five. Where are the other five?
[2962.49s -> 2978.15s]  Any of the bells over there?
[2978.15s -> 2980.15s]  Up top maybe?
[2980.15s -> 2982.58s]  I think I'm gonna go buy speed and ollie.
[2982.58s -> 2987.70s]  I'm pretty slow.
[2987.70s -> 2995.77s]  Is this way to go down too?
[2995.77s -> 2997.77s]  Possible? It might not be possible.
[2997.77s -> 3004.55s]  We'll see.
[3004.55s -> 3012.62s]  Maybe you can actually grab onto that part.
[3012.62s -> 3014.62s]  School bell. We'll give her a school bell.
[3014.62s -> 3019.22s]  I got some money.
[3019.22s -> 3027.74s]  I'll spend it.
[3027.74s -> 3029.74s]  There's so much in this level. I love it so much.
[3029.74s -> 3033.51s]  I'm overwhelmed by all the awesome things
[3033.51s -> 3037.42s]  to do.
[3037.42s -> 3040.10s]  You end up over here.
[3040.10s -> 3042.10s]  And then initial string going off the bench.
[3042.10s -> 3044.10s]  You come all the way down. Up there.
[3044.10s -> 3046.34s]  That's how you get a million points.
[3046.34s -> 3048.34s]  Let's spend some cash.
[3048.34s -> 3056.39s]  I need to go faster.
[3056.39s -> 3058.39s]  Let's see.
[3058.39s -> 3061.83s]  Speed.
[3061.83s -> 3065.54s]  This backs out speed.
[3065.54s -> 3071.56s]  Speed and air.
[3071.56s -> 3075.02s]  Or speed and ollie probably.
[3075.02s -> 3084.30s]  Change the one for up.
[3084.30s -> 3091.34s]  Up and x.
[3091.34s -> 3093.34s]  Down and x.
[3093.34s -> 3096.92s]  Empty.
[3096.92s -> 3098.92s]  I'm gonna say...
[3098.92s -> 3119.77s]  Let's try it again.
[3119.77s -> 3125.27s]  There's a new skating game on Steam.
[3125.27s -> 3129.30s]  There's a lot of
[3129.30s -> 3133.53s]  skating games that have come out since.
[3133.53s -> 3136.02s]  But even after
[3136.02s -> 3138.02s]  something like Skate 2 and Skate 3.
[3138.02s -> 3141.22s]  Like somebody was mentioning that
[3141.22s -> 3143.22s]  the skating culture is...
[3143.22s -> 3145.22s]  Nobody really cares anymore.
[3145.22s -> 3147.22s]  But...
[3147.22s -> 3149.22s]  I don't really care about
[3149.22s -> 3151.22s]  skateboarding.
[3151.22s -> 3153.22s]  But skateboarding games are just
[3153.22s -> 3155.22s]  fun.
[3155.22s -> 3162.97s]  They always have been.
[3162.97s -> 3164.97s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[3170.41s -> 3177.64s]  I need to get this bell over here.
[3177.64s -> 3179.64s]  One more bell.
[3179.64s -> 3181.88s]  What do you think?
[3181.88s -> 3183.88s]  I heard it. Where was it?
[3185.88s -> 3188.06s]  There's this bell.
[3188.06s -> 3190.06s]  Is it up top?
[3195.13s -> 3203.62s]  Got stuck in a wall.
[3203.62s -> 3205.62s]  One thing about Tony Hawk is
[3205.62s -> 3207.62s]  you really need to start to memorize
[3207.62s -> 3209.62s]  the maps.
[3209.62s -> 3211.86s]  It takes a while.
[3211.86s -> 3214.17s]  Then you'll know exactly where everything is.
[3214.17s -> 3216.17s]  You really just do it by skating around.
[3216.17s -> 3218.17s]  I shouldn't really be looking for them.
[3218.17s -> 3220.17s]  Just skating.
[3230.17s -> 3232.17s]  I always have skate.
[3234.17s -> 3236.17s]  T.E.
[3238.73s -> 3240.73s]  This one.
[3240.73s -> 3242.73s]  Whoops.
[3242.73s -> 3244.73s]  Whoops.
[3248.73s -> 3250.73s]  He'll do it for this game
[3250.73s -> 3252.73s]  but not hit and run.
[3252.73s -> 3254.73s]  I don't think
[3254.73s -> 3256.73s]  it's a fair comparison to compare
[3256.73s -> 3258.73s]  Tony Hawk 2 with
[3258.73s -> 3260.73s]  The Simpsons hit and run.
[3262.73s -> 3283.83s]  Beautiful.
[3283.83s -> 3285.83s]  Get up there!
[3285.83s -> 3289.86s]  There's a lot to do up there.
[3289.86s -> 3294.09s]  Shit!
[3294.09s -> 3296.09s]  I'm trying to grab it.
[3296.09s -> 3298.78s]  How many songs does it have?
[3298.78s -> 3300.78s]  I don't know.
[3300.78s -> 3302.78s]  I have no idea.
[3302.78s -> 3304.78s]  Probably like 15.
[3314.58s -> 3324.76s]  Three of five school bells!
[3324.76s -> 3327.70s]  There's another one over here.
[3327.70s -> 3335.56s]  Where's there?
[3337.56s -> 3339.56s]  It's up there.
[3341.56s -> 3343.56s]  How can I reliably get
[3343.56s -> 3345.56s]  up there?
[3345.56s -> 3347.56s]  I don't think it goes from here.
[3353.86s -> 3355.86s]  I hear the bell.
[3355.86s -> 3357.86s]  Where is it?
[3357.86s -> 3359.86s]  I can hear you.
[3359.86s -> 3361.86s]  Where are you bell?
[3361.86s -> 3363.86s]  I just heard you.
[3363.86s -> 3365.86s]  There it is.
[3365.86s -> 3368.74s]  One more.
[3368.74s -> 3371.88s]  Where's that last bell?
[3371.88s -> 3375.59s]  I hear it.
[3375.59s -> 3378.79s]  Where's the bell?
[3378.79s -> 3384.92s]  Where is it?
[3384.92s -> 3388.76s]  Where's the bell?
[3388.76s -> 3390.76s]  Where is the bell?
[3390.76s -> 3392.94s]  I don't even know.
[3392.94s -> 3404.14s]  Was it this one?
[3404.14s -> 3423.83s]  Did I not even get it?
[3423.83s -> 3425.83s]  Skate around.
[3425.83s -> 3449.00s]  That's all I can do.
[3449.00s -> 3451.00s]  I think the music is too loud for me.
[3451.00s -> 3453.00s]  I can't hear any sounds.
[3453.00s -> 3455.00s]  Sorry guys.
[3455.00s -> 3457.94s]  I can't really hear what I'm doing.
[3457.94s -> 3471.37s]  Yeah, that's better.
[3471.37s -> 3473.37s]  20 community subs from Freudian Weapon.
[3473.37s -> 3477.21s]  You guys with the community subs lately.
[3477.21s -> 3479.90s]  It's been so many of them.
[3479.90s -> 3483.22s]  Just hundreds.
[3483.22s -> 3485.66s]  Almost a thousand probably.
[3485.66s -> 3487.66s]  In the last five or six days.
[3487.66s -> 3489.66s]  Get it?
[3489.66s -> 3497.72s]  Ah.
[3497.72s -> 3499.72s]  Walride is so finicky with these.
[3499.72s -> 3501.72s]  Some of them are just stuffed in a corner
[3501.72s -> 3503.90s]  and you really have to just...
[3503.90s -> 3505.90s]  There's no real reliable way to get some of them.
[3505.90s -> 3507.90s]  Just stop what you're doing and go get them.
[3507.90s -> 3511.48s]  Holy shit guys, seriously.
[3511.48s -> 3516.34s]  I'm always missing one.
[3516.34s -> 3518.34s]  Because this is four.
[3518.34s -> 3522.89s]  Now let's see what this is.
[3522.89s -> 3524.89s]  This is down here in the little school yard.
[3524.89s -> 3536.34s]  Let's try to get them.
[3536.34s -> 3538.58s]  Is this one?
[3538.58s -> 3541.40s]  And down here.
[3541.40s -> 3544.73s]  I'll just grab everything I can.
[3544.73s -> 3546.73s]  That makes it down here.
[3546.73s -> 3549.35s]  It's not one itchy fucking neck.
[3549.35s -> 3552.62s]  It was so bad. It was so itchy.
[3552.62s -> 3562.09s]  What is going on with my neck?
[3562.09s -> 3569.13s]  It's like
[3569.13s -> 3571.30s]  under my chin area.
[3571.30s -> 3573.67s]  That's getting like bit by a fucking
[3573.67s -> 3575.67s]  scorpion? What the hell is going on?
[3575.67s -> 3578.49s]  Speaking of what's going on.
[3578.49s -> 3580.49s]  Ten more community subs by getting the clown car.
[3580.49s -> 3585.86s]  Ten
[3585.86s -> 3588.49s]  more on top of everything else.
[3588.49s -> 3592.65s]  Fucking ridiculous.
[3592.65s -> 3594.65s]  Unbelievable.
[3594.65s -> 3599.32s]  Ah.
[3599.32s -> 3612.38s]  I didn't get it. I get it.
[3612.38s -> 3614.38s]  Let's see if I can just hop over.
[3614.38s -> 3618.46s]  Right here. Shit. A little too far.
[3618.46s -> 3621.40s]  Five more from Juno.
[3621.40s -> 3627.54s]  Juno. On top of the
[3627.54s -> 3629.54s]  probably two, like there's probably
[3629.54s -> 3631.72s]  two thousand community subs on this channel.
[3631.72s -> 3633.72s]  I'm not even going to lie.
[3633.72s -> 3635.72s]  I really think there are probably at least
[3635.72s -> 3637.72s]  fifteen hundred to two thousand community subs on the channel.
[3637.72s -> 3639.72s]  That's insane.
[3639.72s -> 3660.20s]  Forget about just getting speed to do it.
[3660.20s -> 3667.94s]  Oh I made it.
[3667.94s -> 3670.18s]  No no no. Stop stop stop.
[3670.18s -> 3672.18s]  There's something down here right?
[3672.18s -> 3675.64s]  Not really. This just kind of ends the trick.
[3675.64s -> 3687.67s]  Ah coming at an angle.
[3687.67s -> 3690.10s]  That's the worst one to get.
[3690.10s -> 3692.10s]  Because you have to go at a slight angle
[3692.10s -> 3694.10s]  to get the bells.
[3694.10s -> 3696.10s]  And that's just plopped right in this weird spot
[3696.10s -> 3698.10s]  in the corner. You have to get it almost from this side.
[3698.10s -> 3702.14s]  Because trying to reliably get it
[3702.14s -> 3704.14s]  this way is sort of not
[3704.14s -> 3708.17s]  really feasible.
[3708.17s -> 3711.11s]  What else we got? Money?
[3715.78s -> 3725.06s]  Hitbox is dumb.
[3725.06s -> 3727.06s]  Yeah it is a little dumb but it's alright.
[3727.06s -> 3736.41s]  I think I want to try the other level first.
[3736.41s -> 3740.95s]  I'm going to hop past this other.
[3740.95s -> 3747.67s]  Some of you guys seriously
[3747.67s -> 3752.02s]  have so many subs.
[3752.02s -> 3754.02s]  There's almost seven thousand subs on this channel.
[3754.02s -> 3756.02s]  In the last three days.
[3756.02s -> 3758.02s]  Do you understand how insane that is?
[3758.02s -> 3761.54s]  There wasn't...
[3761.54s -> 3763.54s]  There's been like almost a couple thousand
[3763.54s -> 3765.54s]  added in the last week and a half.
[3765.54s -> 3767.54s]  That's absolutely ridiculous.
[3767.54s -> 3781.50s]  This is all
[3781.50s -> 3783.50s]  really seriously has been in the last not even
[3783.50s -> 3786.18s]  thirty days. I really hope
[3786.18s -> 3788.18s]  you guys can like afford it.
[3788.18s -> 3790.18s]  Because that's a lot of money.
[3790.18s -> 3793.70s]  That's like a huge
[3793.70s -> 3797.29s]  amount of money. My God.
[3797.29s -> 3799.29s]  Thank you.
[3799.29s -> 3801.29s]  I just hope you take care of yourself first.
[3801.29s -> 3810.38s]  Visual Warlock
[3810.38s -> 3816.52s]  ten community subs. I'm going to try
[3816.52s -> 3821.77s]  the other level. I want the points.
[3821.77s -> 3834.63s]  Thank you so much guys.
[3834.63s -> 3836.63s]  That's twenty from AmScoots.
[3836.63s -> 3838.63s]  Thank you AmScoots for twenty community subs.
[3838.63s -> 3844.90s]  Dropping sub missiles.
[3844.90s -> 3854.23s]  This is France.
[3854.23s -> 3856.23s]  What was the point? Things for France.
[3856.23s -> 3861.16s]  Alright, not again.
[3861.16s -> 3864.04s]  No, not again. No.
[3864.04s -> 3866.04s]  Every stream can't be a money stream.
[3866.04s -> 3869.05s]  That's thirty-three from
[3869.05s -> 3871.05s]  Soft33. With the namesake.
[3871.05s -> 3875.40s]  Thank you so much for the
[3875.40s -> 3881.67s]  thirty-three community subs.
[3881.67s -> 3884.55s]  I don't even know what to say. It's
[3884.55s -> 3889.29s]  shocking to me.
[3889.29s -> 3895.56s]  You guys are fucking too much. Thank you.
[3895.56s -> 3900.36s]  Five more from getting the clown car.
[3900.36s -> 3903.82s]  He's
[3903.82s -> 3905.82s]  complaining about getting money.
[3905.82s -> 3908.57s]  No, it's just
[3908.57s -> 3910.57s]  those of you that have been watching the channel for the last
[3910.57s -> 3912.57s]  week. It's been
[3912.57s -> 3914.57s]  an uncountable amount of money.
[3914.57s -> 3916.57s]  An extreme
[3916.57s -> 3918.57s]  amount of money.
[3918.57s -> 3920.57s]  Thousands of dollars. Like probably five or six
[3920.57s -> 3922.57s]  thousand dollars.
[3922.57s -> 3924.57s]  I don't know how to react.
[3924.57s -> 3926.57s]  It's so much money.
[3926.57s -> 3934.25s]  It's super overwhelming.
[3950.68s -> 3952.68s]  The more money the more taxes.
[3952.68s -> 3970.65s]  I wish there
[3970.65s -> 3972.65s]  was more I could say. I really wish
[3972.65s -> 3980.58s]  there was. Some of you guys are
[3980.58s -> 3982.58s]  so generous that I don't even know what to say.
[3982.58s -> 3986.68s]  Let me restart this.
[3986.68s -> 3991.80s]  You're just telling him to stop because you're going to blow it at the casino
[3991.80s -> 3998.14s]  anyways.
[3998.14s -> 4000.14s]  So this one is in heats. I'm in direct competition with
[4000.14s -> 4012.23s]  other people. But you guys are
[4012.23s -> 4017.16s]  incredible. Thank you so much.
[4017.16s -> 4028.74s]  Fucking incredible.
[4028.74s -> 4042.82s]  I gotta string something together here.
[4042.82s -> 4049.93s]  No!
[4049.93s -> 4054.28s]  I had it. That's ten songs in
[4054.28s -> 4060.04s]  one minute I know.
[4060.04s -> 4062.04s]  That's the nature of Tony Hawk though. You gotta restart.
[4062.04s -> 4064.41s]  You have a good string going.
[4064.41s -> 4067.48s]  I'll close it up there.
[4067.48s -> 4075.86s]  Oops.
[4075.86s -> 4077.86s]  Shit. Don't restart.
[4079.86s -> 4084.15s]  Stay on it.
[4084.15s -> 4093.62s]  It's ruined for like fifty thousand.
[4093.62s -> 4100.15s]  I think that'll be good.
[4100.15s -> 4104.12s]  Special.
[4108.12s -> 4110.12s]  Oof. Got it.
[4110.12s -> 4117.53s]  Ninety-three thousand.
[4117.53s -> 4121.82s]  That should be enough to give me a cross, right?
[4121.82s -> 4123.82s]  Ninety-five point three. I'll take it.
[4123.82s -> 4130.98s]  Ninety-five. Ninety-one.
[4130.98s -> 4133.22s]  Fifty-seven. I win.
[4133.22s -> 4142.57s]  Boomer becomes expert skater in an hour.
[4142.57s -> 4146.47s]  And I like to see myself
[4146.47s -> 4150.18s]  skater myself.
[4150.18s -> 4154.54s]  I gotta make this one better.
[4154.54s -> 4164.14s]  Over here.
[4164.14s -> 4166.50s]  This one has a lot of rails.
[4166.50s -> 4172.97s]  A lot of strings you can do in this one.
[4172.97s -> 4177.19s]  Going for a hundred thousand.
[4177.19s -> 4179.56s]  Ow.
[4179.56s -> 4194.15s]  Shit. I'm trying to get too funky with it.
[4194.15s -> 4204.07s]  I need like at least
[4204.07s -> 4206.07s]  I gotta string it together right now. Let's go.
[4206.07s -> 4213.24s]  Alright. Here we go.
[4213.24s -> 4222.71s]  Ninety-five. Ninety-six.
[4222.71s -> 4227.51s]  Thank you Haunty
[4227.51s -> 4230.07s]  for the community subs. Five
[4230.07s -> 4234.17s]  community subs. We're gonna have more
[4234.17s -> 4237.24s]  subs than viewers.
[4237.24s -> 4242.10s]  We actually do. Still in first place?
[4242.10s -> 4255.02s]  The math works out.
[4255.02s -> 4257.02s]  Last heat. I need a hundred thousand here.
[4257.02s -> 4265.85s]  Alright. End it. End it. End it. End it. End it.
[4265.85s -> 4282.94s]  Hop off. Let's try it again. String it up
[4282.94s -> 4292.86s]  around the bench.
[4292.86s -> 4296.57s]  I didn't get the dark slide. Come on.
[4296.57s -> 4306.17s]  I need a hundred thousand. Oh no.
[4306.17s -> 4308.60s]  I can get something right now.
[4308.60s -> 4319.10s]  Go. Go. Go. Go.
[4319.10s -> 4321.53s]  Fuck. That should still be
[4321.53s -> 4326.25s]  enough.
[4326.25s -> 4329.90s]  Thank you Tyga for the five community subs.
[4329.90s -> 4331.90s]  Hopefully Tyga it's enough for me
[4331.90s -> 4333.90s]  to stay in first place.
[4333.90s -> 4339.59s]  But much love to you. Thank you all
[4339.59s -> 4342.41s]  of you. I did it. Got the gold medal.

[4352.33s -> 4354.33s]  I was gonna turn up my quality but I realized it's just
[4354.33s -> 4357.91s]  the Dreamcast.
[4357.91s -> 4362.90s]  It is. Also
[4362.90s -> 4372.65s]  is from great canadian fuck club 50 dollars and nearly a thousand subs belong to great canadian
[4372.65s -> 4381.86s]  fuck club just one we gotta be kind of aware of that that's insane and another 50 dollars from
[4381.86s -> 4394.70s]  great canadian fuck club truly the greatest canadian uh jerma tell a funny joke when you

[4438.01s -> 4459.43s]  probably thank you guys new york city read that all the way around okay canada owns you now
[4459.99s -> 4483.29s]  no i can switch around the other side watch this one all right too far trying to just not
[4483.29s -> 4508.34s]  jump so far to the left is it impossible i guess maybe not all right this is my last retry
[4508.34s -> 4552.50s]  easy watch the turn okay but it's okay for the score at the moment t subway token the a

[4722.76s -> 4725.88s]  i gotta look at the tricks though because there are some other ones that are worth way more
[4725.88s -> 4729.82s]  points

[6732.74s -> 6737.86s]  going to be able to do any of these strings without more ollie and more air because that's
[6737.86s -> 6745.77s]  what's actually the problem that is the actual problem but tony hawke pro skater 3
[6746.49s -> 6748.57s]  was very good too it was really good actually

[6992.98s -> 7009.59s]  irritating but not yet let's go get these down here
[7011.91s -> 7023.91s]  okay they call them oras it's called an aura when you just know you're gonna get a migraine
[7023.91s -> 7028.87s]  and then you get a migraine it's really fucking weird all right where is this last
[7028.87s -> 7030.63s]  bell it's uh i got the two that are down here
[7033.59s -> 7035.88s]  there's only one more like this way right
[7040.12s -> 7045.37s]  i got that one over there that wall here i think right
[7050.02s -> 7056.36s]  five bells do i have enough to do anything else
[7061.06s -> 7064.98s]  yeah sometimes uh the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me with a migraine
[7066.02s -> 7072.26s]  is like sometimes an hour or two before i get a migraine i will get like splotching vision
[7072.98s -> 7075.54s]  almost like i'm people when i look at them they look like they're a Picasso painting
[7077.46s -> 7081.38s]  and that's not really happening right now but i'm getting like i don't know i feel like it
[7081.38s -> 7089.82s]  i feel like it might start happening here soon i get that with every migraine it's really weird
[7097.45s -> 7103.88s]  it's called allison wonderland syndrome that's not happening right now i just have that like
[7103.88s -> 7117.72s]  kind of heavy back of the head feeling what was that what else was here let me see i got
[7117.72s -> 7128.58s]  that gamer nerd neck going a hangover i haven't had any alcohol i didn't drink today didn't drink

[7141.19s -> 7147.70s]  that's probably the smart thing to do for my health i thought it was gamer fatigue i wasn't
[7147.70s -> 7151.54s]  the last like 45 minutes or so i i really thought it was gamer fatigue it's probably
[7151.54s -> 7175.26s]  migraine yeah i gotta save it save the career it's already saved i think right
[7179.72s -> 7184.52s]  but you will see me again uh i'm going to and i'm not going to scream tomorrow
[7185.64s -> 7190.28s]  so the next time you guys see me you'll see me on monday and we will probably do

[7199.35s -> 7205.88s]  a little off the last like hour or so probably gonna have a headache in about 30 minutes
[7206.52s -> 7217.98s]  oh somebody clip it somebody clip it i did it right i said it let's see it it happened
[7219.06s -> 7223.54s]  i mean it's completely different circumstances but it happened i said i'm off today didn't i

[7319.03s -> 7324.97s]  community subs which shocks me even i can't fucking believe it that there are people that

[7459.38s -> 7465.18s]  thank you for the 10 dollars it's time for slime smooth smooth smooth thank you
[7465.98s -> 7469.93s]  freudian weapon thanks to the five dollars always prioritize your health man it's important
[7471.62s -> 7478.28s]  no i do i do i'm not i can't just i can't force myself to stream or talk or it's kind
[7478.28s -> 7484.52s]  of very just creeping up on me that something was off up here in the skull everyone i told you
[7484.52s -> 7492.17s]  i was like itchy i don't i think that was just like i don't know that was weird it was like my
[7492.17s -> 7498.71s]  back yeah i don't know weird very strange and that was like an hour and a half ago so it
[7498.71s -> 7517.61s]  wasn't gamer fatigue but uh thank you for the concern and i yeah i'm i'm absolutely going to
[7517.61s -> 7523.61s]  prioritize my health and that's why we're ending early because i'm trying to escape this
[7523.69s -> 7532.01s]  potential uh future issue for sure but thank you thank you uh soft for the 10 bucks soft 33
[7532.57s -> 7538.25s]  and 33 community subs as well hey germa sorry i've been too busy with work to watch the streams
[7538.25s -> 7541.21s]  lately i've been wanting to give back to this awesome community and you for a while
[7541.77s -> 7553.19s]  thanks for the years of laughs thank you yeah i get fairly stuck and overwhelmed sometimes
[7553.19s -> 7559.42s]  when a huge amount of money comes in and it happened it's happened this this is kind of the
[7559.42s -> 7571.02s]  third stream in a row of monumental money and support and i i'm sorry i don't i don't necessarily
[7571.02s -> 7576.15s]  sometimes i don't take it very well not necessarily take it well but sometimes it's
[7576.15s -> 7586.82s]  hard for me to um mentally accept it sometimes and i know some people would just
[7586.82s -> 7591.54s]  say well whatever you're gonna you're gonna be upset about somebody giving you money no it's not
[7591.54s -> 7598.14s]  it's not that it's just it's it's a lot of support and a lot of money from people
[7599.67s -> 7606.17s]  and sometimes it can be i i just want to make sure that it's worth it's worth it it can be
[7606.17s -> 7619.93s]  very very um i'm trying the word i'm looking for is it's not it's not a bad thing but when
[7619.93s -> 7622.73s]  i look at some of these numbers and i and i see some of the amount of money that people
[7622.73s -> 7628.25s]  give and the amounts of subscribers that are on the channel it's kind of light kind of goes
[7628.25s -> 7634.89s]  into my eyes and it's like holy shit what the fuck this is fucking crazy and it happened very
[7634.89s -> 7654.79s]  very quickly i do appreciate it it's it's a huge deal the hyper growth monetarily on this
[7654.79s -> 7664.70s]  channel over the last two months three months is just it's wild and sometimes i just don't
[7664.70s -> 7673.14s]  kind of don't know what to say but i i'm i'm incredibly honored and happy that people
[7673.14s -> 7676.58s]  think this is a good community to be a part of and to spend that much money on
[7677.78s -> 7697.94s]  thank you so much please excuse my sometimes shocked demeanor when it happens but thank
[7697.94s -> 7705.40s]  you novi for the three dollars and 33 cents road to 10 000 subs i can't even imagine i
[7705.40s -> 7718.38s]  can't even comprehend that number so you don't have to say anything just
[7720.22s -> 7728.84s]  yeah but also keep in mind sometimes when uh the string of the last few streams when thousands
[7728.84s -> 7734.63s]  thousands of dollars come in i i mean i don't want somebody to think that i'm just glazing
[7734.63s -> 7742.31s]  over the donation but it it's it's it's difficult because i don't want people to
[7742.31s -> 7745.27s]  think that like oh you don't have to say anything whatever here's just here's like five
[7745.27s -> 7763.54s]  grand it's like wow so i want to address it and but sometimes i kind of lose it a little bit
[7764.50s -> 7777.13s]  but it means a lot thank you all of you thank you uh jess homeboy for the one dollar tony
[7777.13s -> 7783.43s]  hawk status in 2003 i was requested to meet with warner brothers about doing a film
[7783.43s -> 7792.38s]  about it's called skate jam so there was going to be a tony hawk space jam that would have
[7792.38s -> 7803.64s]  been ridiculous that would have been so good probably not though it would have been kind of
[7804.28s -> 7807.40s]  i don't even know how good that could have been this potential there but i'm not sure
[7807.40s -> 7813.24s]  where the ceiling is for that potential thank you dork cube for the one dollar another
[7813.24s -> 7818.60s]  game for you to look into is thug pro it's a modded version of tony hawk underground 2
[7818.60s -> 7822.76s]  that has a handful of maps from every game in the series and an awesome character creator
[7823.32s -> 7830.98s]  and online is fun i forget just how many tony hawk games there are there's a lot of
[7830.98s -> 7838.36s]  tony hawk games but that's cool tony hawk's underground 2 was it playstation 3
[7842.36s -> 7848.50s]  you just started watching and i mean yeah i'm sorry for the end i was gonna go for like
[7848.50s -> 7855.13s]  another couple hours but something in my i'm getting a like a little bit of of a
[7855.13s -> 7863.54s]  headache-y feeling so i kind of gonna go relax but sorry for the five hour stream
[7864.18s -> 7870.33s]  i like to go for at least six to seven nowadays uh but thank you dork you began
[7870.33s -> 7874.09s]  for the one dollar you better play sonic adventure in its entirety including big the cat missions
[7874.81s -> 7886.46s]  i'm not sure i'll get that far but maybe thank you peter for the five dollars actually beat
[7886.46s -> 7894.60s]  valgas on stream i went kicking and screaming but i did it peter thank you 15 dolls from
[7894.60s -> 7908.17s]  peter beat valgas on stream that was me uh thank you tar alecran for the two bucks hey
[7908.17s -> 7910.97s]  germa now that we've got the dreamcast out is there any date on if when you're going to
[7910.97s -> 7916.76s]  play shinmu i'm super excited for that stream and i don't want to miss it yeah i actually have
[7916.76s -> 7923.82s]  shinmu now on pc so it'll be a little bit more higher fidelity you can probably expect
[7925.86s -> 7933.64s]  the shinmu stuff to happen i would assume i'll probably start shinmu one after
[7934.84s -> 7938.44s]  resident evil 2 and resident evil 2 will probably only take one stream
[7939.08s -> 7944.36s]  because from what i've gathered it's only about a seven to eight hour game to do
[7944.36s -> 7956.10s]  there's like two campaigns right so at least for one of those campaigns bring back monster rancher
[7958.58s -> 7964.79s]  but shinmu will happen eventually i own them all i own both of them uh thank you anon a list
[7964.79s -> 7969.03s]  for the one dollar hey germa it's the guy who runs the exotic animal rescue here i've been
[7969.03s -> 7972.07s]  watching a long time and i want to say your streams always lighten the mood when we get in

[8024.39s -> 8027.91s]  again for the one dollar just heard the news are we gonna have to start paying six dollars
[8027.91s -> 8034.17s]  instead of two to get our bits read no how did six dollars come about six dollars
[8035.21s -> 8049.18s]  well it was three who's spreading the six dollar lie that's not true thank you door cube
[8049.18s -> 8052.78s]  for the one dollar not only did domino's pioneer the stuffed crust this is how they

[8067.50s -> 8073.40s]  then it's a deal yes we eat our pizza the wrong way this is pizza introducing stuff crust
[8073.40s -> 8081.50s]  pizza from pizza that's not dominant that's don't that's pizza that wasn't there's pizza
[8081.50s -> 8088.04s]  hut thank you for the one dollar thank you for the one dollar again door cube
[8088.68s -> 8092.76s]  when i think of bad games the good bad games i always think of these dreamcast exclusives
[8093.32s -> 8096.52s]  you can tell the developers wanted to do so much but the system was holding them back
[8097.72s -> 8108.10s]  maybe a lot of these old games a lot of the developers are still making stuff you really
[8108.10s -> 8115.66s]  only had it's like a goldfish right when you're in a tiny little bowl you're a tiny
[8115.66s -> 8121.34s]  little goldfish you're yeah it is just the bowl you're in not necessarily i mean some

[8245.98s -> 8249.98s]  not all the dlc could be released before the dreamcast discontinuation so the developers
[8249.98s -> 8261.00s]  eventually released a vmu save file with all the dlc unlocked that's insane but thank you

[8621.02s -> 8625.26s]  people do this thing when they first start drinking where they want to look like they
[8625.26s -> 8632.12s]  can handle it to a point where fault you know no i'm good i'm good i'm good you want
[8632.12s -> 8638.68s]  to take a shot yeah yeah yeah and you overdo it so nobody no one's gonna be like no one's

[8643.58s -> 8654.47s]  might think and especially in the chat people are saying it already uh every pretty much every
[8654.47s -> 8661.30s]  one drink you consume you want to drink like a glass of water well maybe every every two drinks
[8662.10s -> 8666.42s]  if you let's say you go into a bar after you've had two drinks order the third one
[8666.42s -> 8669.62s]  and just be like hey can i get a water they'll just it's free they just they
[8670.74s -> 8680.79s]  and drink the water now you don't have to like suck down water every 10 minutes because
[8680.79s -> 8690.44s]  i mean that's not good for you anyways but you really look into maybe like every two or three
[8690.44s -> 8696.49s]  drinks make sure you have a water if you're at the bar and if you're not at the bar then just
[8696.49s -> 8707.94s]  take it slow you still drink water and yeah and self-control too you just want to make
[8707.94s -> 8713.48s]  sure you don't go too overboard but again that feeds back into the first thing that i said
