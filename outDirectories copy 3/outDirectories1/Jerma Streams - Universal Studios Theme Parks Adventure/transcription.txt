[1.46s -> 5.70s]  Okay, so I have a couple of options here that I think we could pivot to that would be fun.
[6.66s -> 13.62s]  I don't know which one to do because there's very real possibility that one of the two of these
[13.62s -> 18.66s]  things that I want to just throw in here are going to be so bad. I'm not sure which one.
[20.82s -> 26.66s]  I have Universal Studios Ride the Rides for GameCube. I don't know why I bought it,
[26.66s -> 36.50s]  I don't even know how I bought this. Or another Cooking Mama game that was on the Wii,
[36.50s -> 41.46s]  the Cooking Mama 2 for the Wii, and then go to Animal Crossing in like another couple hours.
[41.46s -> 47.66s]  I'm not sure which one of those I want to do right now, but they both sound very interesting to me.
[50.07s -> 61.14s]  Should we ride the rides at Universal? Universal Studios? Look, this just got caught in the wind
[61.14s -> 66.81s]  here. I'm just looking up GameCube games that look like they could be fun and interesting,
[67.61s -> 71.53s]  and I'm like, when am I going to have an opportunity to play this fucking game? Ever.
[71.53s -> 76.18s]  Because this game, this is a game that I will never play for more than an hour or two,
[78.46s -> 92.63s]  so it seems like a pretty good spot for it right now. And look, if this game is absolute dog shit,
[92.63s -> 97.14s]  then we can just keep moving around. I'm open today, I'm open to whatever,
[98.71s -> 102.79s]  but this is already set up so it's going to have to be something for the GameCube or the Wii.
[104.02s -> 114.97s]  We want to go on rides? Okay, let's go on some rides. We might have to do some changing of the
[114.97s -> 134.04s]  audio. Let's see. Do we have to do any changing of the audio? This game is not a true representation
[134.04s -> 141.69s]  of Universal Studios theme parks. What? I missed, oh, I missed 50 dollar bits, holy shit. 5,000 bits
[141.69s -> 148.84s]  from Phylacter Lich, that's 50 more bucks. Please play Gotcha Force, you sexy BLT clown. Gotcha
[148.84s -> 153.45s]  Force is probably going to be like a 10 hour stream, and that was not on the plans for today.
[153.45s -> 175.10s]  This is going to take too long. Oh, there he is! Wait, why is he in there? Why is he in there?
[175.66s -> 181.75s]  Are we going to get a, please be the person that takes us around the whole park.
[182.47s -> 203.48s]  There's no dialogue. Are you guys ready to ride these rides? This game is going to be very bad,
[203.48s -> 217.29s]  I can already tell. You know, in hindsight, I'd like to uncheck the box when this is in my cart
[217.85s -> 229.53s]  to remove it from my cart, but I can't do that. All right, you ready to test the audio? We're
[229.53s -> 245.75s]  going to do some audio testing here. Ready? Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Oh, shit. Boom. It's all right.
[245.75s -> 258.52s]  Just skip and play Cooking. How is this game hard? Rumble feature. I don't know, I hate Rumble.
[258.52s -> 279.03s]  Universal Studios theme park adventure. Name, what's your name? That doesn't matter. Me. I don't
[279.03s -> 305.02s]  care. It doesn't matter. Jeremy. Player select. No. Oh, there, there. Oh, please do it. Please.
[305.02s -> 309.66s]  That's all I care about. It'll be worth the like 80 cent purchase if we get like a
[310.06s -> 333.42s]  uh
[333.42s -> 342.33s]  Welcome to Universal Studios. I'm Woody Woodpecker. And today at Universal Studios,
[342.33s -> 349.35s]  we have exciting theme areas based on the movie world. Today in the marketing of stamp collection
[349.35s -> 357.53s]  contest. That's not Woody Woodpecker. This is not how Woody Woodpecker sounds. Let's begin.
[363.10s -> 369.58s]  Get lost. Do it. Holy shit. They couldn't even get somebody to do it. They couldn't get somebody
[369.58s -> 377.37s]  to go to do the it is it's it's about put those kids to sleep. Well, yeah, I can do this on this
[377.37s -> 381.45s]  thing. It's gonna take some thinking. You can do this on my sound machine right now.
[415.85s -> 419.69s]  All right, let's go. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't
[419.69s -> 427.51s]  wait. I can't wait. Come on. Come on. Come on. I want to get to the right. I want to get to
[427.51s -> 445.11s]  Space Mountain. How do I do anything? Oh, all right. That's not real. This is the kind of costume
[445.11s -> 454.36s]  man. Can I talk to people? Stamps are either red or blue. You'll earn a red stamp if you score high
[454.36s -> 458.95s]  in an attraction.
[480.09s -> 486.25s]  Motion picture magic. No, I don't want to watch a movie. I want to ride. The game is very loud.
[487.13s -> 491.93s]  Is that better? Oh, no, I'm quiet. That was my fault.
[498.62s -> 512.01s]  ET. Give me on ET. What's up, you fucking creep? Yes.
[559.19s -> 568.60s]  I didn't get any of that. I don't know how this works. I don't know how to play the game. All I
[568.60s -> 574.68s]  heard was everybody sticking a needle into my ear and hitting like the fucking right side of my
[574.68s -> 583.16s]  brain. Wait, I actually have to do... This is not how the ride works. I thought I was just going to
[583.16s -> 602.07s]  ride the ride. Wait, it like put me in ET the movie. Go. All right, can I stop bunny hopping
[602.07s -> 623.06s]  and go for these speed bumps? All right, to be fair, I do that. I used to do that shit all the
[623.06s -> 636.17s]  time on my bike, even when I wasn't rushing to deliver an alien through his spaceship. God,
[636.17s -> 651.70s]  this ride sucks. This is really... What a shitty ride. Hey, kid, just go ride down the street.
[653.13s -> 667.86s]  You have four minutes to ride a regular bike down the street. Cool. I left three and a half
[667.86s -> 681.26s]  minutes to get there. How do I speed up? At what point is there adult intervention?
[684.18s -> 707.69s]  He keeps falling down. But now they're trying to kill him. Crunchy. This is fucking terrible.
[708.73s -> 711.37s]  But I need to... Hold on. We're getting into the hard part.
[713.98s -> 719.10s]  Holy shit. They're dropping... They're doing like Bowser, every Bowser boss fight.
[719.58s -> 733.14s]  All again, Jeremy. It's funny. I'm just pedaling, dude. I'm going to get there.
[733.78s -> 738.17s]  By the way, somebody said they guarantee I don't... They guaranteed I don't beat the first
[738.17s -> 742.01s]  level. Somebody said that. I want to make sure that that's on the line now.
[762.87s -> 772.86s]  He actually did it. Yeah. We're almost at the end. I have two minutes to get like 15 feet.
[773.50s -> 781.10s]  It's not over yet. I know. I can see. This is a loading screen. Yeah, it was a loading screen.
[781.74s -> 797.37s]  Did it go over this? Oh, okay. I will tell you. I promise. If the next level is this exact same
[797.37s -> 804.41s]  level, this exact same game with a different coat of paint on it. It's a side scrolling racer with
[805.37s -> 812.01s]  a goal at the end. If that's the next game, I will take the discount immediately and I will throw it
[812.01s -> 830.30s]  away. Okay? I promise. I will recycle. I will recycle this, if that's the case. Eat the disc.
[830.30s -> 845.24s]  No. All right. How did it end? Is this a ride or is this a really, really, really rich kid's
[845.24s -> 860.36s]  expensive birthday party? This is all for me. Holy fuck, man. It took some of you motherfuckers
[860.36s -> 875.94s]  an hour to do this. 59 minutes. That's impossible. That's not even possible.
[876.74s -> 884.25s]  Some. All, actually. All. Did I get a stamp? Oh, we can do a quiz. All right. I got the E.T.
[884.25s -> 904.39s]  stamp. All right. I'm not done. Is there a map? Map. Where's map? Item. Is there a map? Can I go
[904.39s -> 911.32s]  in the mailbox? Go to Jurassic Park? I mean, I have no idea where to even go. I'm like a lost kid.
[912.04s -> 924.44s]  Most in picture. Magic. What's this thing? Can I do this one? Press tab, noob. There's no tab on a
[924.44s -> 932.87s]  GameCube. Wait, somebody wanted to talk to me. What do you want? Someone was handing out maps
[932.87s -> 946.65s]  at the park entrance. I mean, he looked. Looked at what? All right. There's the park entrance
[946.65s -> 953.93s]  right here. Where are the maps? Map. Do you have a cap? You can enter some attractions whenever you
[954.01s -> 972.47s]  want if you have a cap. This music not like this. All right. Give me a map. Hello. There are letter
[972.47s -> 976.79s]  tiles hidden inside the park. You'll receive a stamp if you collect all the tiles. You'll earn
[976.79s -> 985.13s]  points if you click. Uh-huh. All right. Woody, give me a map. Right now, every attraction is at
[985.13s -> 990.97s]  full capacity and nobody can get in. I'll give you this. E-pass. You can only have one E-pass,
[990.97s -> 995.69s]  but you have priority to enter any attraction that you want. So if you decide to use your E-pass,
[995.69s -> 1007.21s]  choose the attraction wisely. What? I have to use an express pass? I want to exchange my points.
[1012.71s -> 1024.58s]  ET cap. T-Rex shoes. No, no. No, no, no. I want to come back. This is just animal crossing, yeah?
[1026.25s -> 1031.86s]  Where's the entrance to this park that somebody has a map for me? Over 40,000 points.
[1032.58s -> 1043.35s]  Get the fuck out of here. Unlock everything. I'm not gonna do that. Where do I get this map?
[1043.99s -> 1047.75s]  I heard somebody was handing out maps at the entrance. Well, where the hell are they?
[1048.39s -> 1062.10s]  Is there a sprint? Can I go right? No. I'm just gonna keep following the road. What's the,
[1062.10s -> 1066.49s]  what's the worst that could happen? Right? What do you mean? There? There? Right there? Where?
[1067.29s -> 1077.80s]  Who has a map? Nobody has a map. Who's going down the road? You're gonna get hit by a truck.
[1078.52s -> 1086.94s]  Do you have a map? No. Okay. I don't have a map. If you don't have a map, get one back at the park
[1086.94s -> 1138.09s]  entrance. The red lady? Nobody has a map. There's no, this lady? This lady didn't, hey, hello.
[1138.09s -> 1146.07s]  Nobody has a map, guys. Nobody has a fucking map. Red lady. This is a blast. I'm having so much fun.
[1147.83s -> 1152.49s]  I need an, I need an adult to help me do this. Where's there? I'm at the park. This is the park
[1152.49s -> 1159.85s]  entrance right now. Red. Do you know where you're going next? I don't know. I don't know where to go.
[1161.85s -> 1168.73s]  Help. Which attraction should I go see now? I don't know. I need help. I'm lost. Wait. I can go down
[1168.73s -> 1192.82s]  here. Wait. Just get this shit out of me. Map. All right. This is the park entrance. I'm supposed
[1192.82s -> 1204.22s]  to go into the fucking parking lot. Where is the map person? I'm in the parking lot. Do you have
[1204.22s -> 1214.02s]  maps? The weather is always nice. Don't leave. I'm not gonna just leave. You think this kid has
[1214.02s -> 1219.46s]  enough to like survive walking down? No, he's got like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and
[1219.46s -> 1230.57s]  like Ritz crackers in his backpack. I'm not, Lee, I'm not going anywhere. This map doesn't
[1230.57s -> 1241.22s]  fucking exist. It doesn't. I just have to walk to the next ride. I'll just walk into the next ride.
[1241.22s -> 1246.36s]  I don't even care what it is. Do you have a Ritz sponsorship? No, but they're fucking utterly
[1246.36s -> 1253.10s]  delicious. When you put a Ritz cracker in your mouth, you can eat them by themselves. Wait,
[1253.10s -> 1267.85s]  you mean blind again? The guy in blue. What? Here, have a map. All right. We're going to,
[1268.81s -> 1275.88s]  we're going, here we go. When you put a Ritz cracker in your mouth, this shit disintegrates.
[1276.52s -> 1281.64s]  It's so buttery and flavorful and it just disintegrates in your mouth. You put a little,
[1281.64s -> 1287.16s]  one little like cube of cheese on it. You put a little piece of salami on it. Ritz crackers
[1287.16s -> 1291.80s]  are seriously some of the best snack you could ever have. You can eat them by themselves.
[1292.04s -> 1297.80s]  They're fulfilling. They're, they're, they're satisfying. I, I fully endorse Ritz crackers
[1298.76s -> 1308.58s]  for a snack president, I guess. All right. Where am I going? All right. Let's go this way.
[1316.34s -> 1335.66s]  I got it. I L. Oh, what's that up there? New ride. It's not even a ride. It's not even a ride.
[1337.77s -> 1354.26s]  Got it. Can I find something? Please? I think I found something. Jaws. All right. Let's get on
[1354.26s -> 1365.42s]  Jaws. You can't enter this attraction because there are too many people. Wait, you have an E
[1365.42s -> 1390.81s]  pass. Let me know whenever you want to try this attraction. Just wait in line. I can go once.
[1391.53s -> 1398.02s]  All right. Let's fucking go. A Jaws. This is going to be the coolest one. Let's go. I'm going to
[1398.02s -> 1446.71s]  Jaws. I'm freaking me the fuck out. I don't, I don't even know how to play. I have no fucking idea.
[1448.34s -> 1456.68s]  A and B. Wait, I'm Jaws. All right. Let's go pick up barrel and throw barrel at Jaws.
[1457.32s -> 1495.51s]  Hurry up. Get out of here. Oh shit. He took a bite. Uh, starboard, right? Get up, get up, get up,
[1495.51s -> 1503.03s]  get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up. Oh my God. He's
[1503.03s -> 1525.40s]  going to eat me. Oh shit. A kid fell down off the jaws where I turned it off. This is not even
[1525.40s -> 1534.57s]  hitting him. How do I open shit? Can I open these boxes? He's wrecking the boat. Yeah. I mean,
[1534.57s -> 1560.78s]  I have to hit him with these things, but he keeps. It was so dumb. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come
[1560.78s -> 1575.99s]  on. Do it again. Here we go. I'm running out of Donkey Kong barrels to throw at this guy.
[1591.61s -> 1614.94s]  Are the yellow ones worth more damage or something? Imagine paying like $150 million to license all
[1614.94s -> 1633.61s]  the shit in this game and you throw boxes at Jaws off the boat. I have 30 seconds to continue.
[1634.33s -> 1651.88s]  Wait, which one's selected? All right. Here we go. I'll get it. Now I understand the mechanics.
[1652.52s -> 1667.98s]  Well, I didn't know if it was like, it was like depressed or not. Please no more. No, no, no. I'm
[1667.98s -> 1687.29s]  not done. I'm not done. I'm not done. Please no more. That zoom in on his face. That perfect
[1687.37s -> 1699.78s]  zoom in with the thing in the fucking head. Oh, throw it. Look at Jaws in the top left.
[1700.34s -> 1775.10s]  Fuck out of here. Jaws. Please no more. Don't fall kid. It's only one guy saying no more. All
[1775.10s -> 1789.77s]  right. All right. All right. Okay. All right. That's fine. It's so dumb. It's so dumb. It's so dumb.
[1790.65s -> 1818.73s]  Only one guy said only one guy was saying no more. Wait, what? Only one guy was saying
[1818.73s -> 1826.89s]  only one guy was saying no more. You're going through too many layers of one guy. I can't,
[1826.89s -> 1841.02s]  I can't follow you that well. All right. I think I only have to do one more. There's only one spot?
[1841.02s -> 1857.51s]  No, there's like four. Let's go. What's he doing? He's circling the boat. Let's go, man.
[1857.51s -> 1879.18s]  Oh, oh, because he's, oh, yeah. Okay. Yes. Yes. I see what you're saying because there's only
[1879.18s -> 1886.22s]  one green spot left on the boat. The game is so stupid and it has to be here. Get boxed, motherfucker.
[1887.66s -> 1928.55s]  He just leaves. Yeah, you're done. Yeah, you're done. Got the stamp. Good job. Is that loud?
[1929.90s -> 1934.98s]  Wait, that was, oh my God, that is very loud. Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I didn't know. I didn't
[1934.98s -> 1940.63s]  realize I was going to be that loud. I just, I'm sorry. I'm actually very, very sorry about that.
[1940.63s -> 1945.11s]  I did not know that was going to be that crunchy and that extreme. Sorry about that. I really am.
[1946.07s -> 1959.83s]  I didn't mean to do that. My neck. Hello, guys. This game is giving me a stiff neck.
[1966.14s -> 1981.08s]  My hands are a little sore. That feels a little better. We have $50 coming. We had
[1981.08s -> 1990.01s]  a 50, a 50, 50, 50, 50. 5,000 bits from Goiki. Seriously, thanks for the 5,000 bits. Thanks for
[1990.01s -> 1994.57s]  the $50, Goiki. This game is fun in a stupid way, but it reminds me of the countless nightmares I've
[1994.57s -> 2001.66s]  had about falling into the Jaws ride and it being a real shark. I remember, here's a quick story
[2001.66s -> 2005.90s]  for you. I remember being really, really scared of the Jaws ride when I was like 10 or 11 years
[2005.90s -> 2011.82s]  old or something like that when I went to Universal. And I was, I hyped myself up so much
[2011.82s -> 2017.10s]  and I was so terrified of it that when I actually got on the ride, I kind of closed my eyes for the
[2017.10s -> 2023.02s]  almost the entire duration of the ride. But I heard my brother laughing and he thought it was
[2023.02s -> 2027.58s]  really funny and I didn't understand why he was laughing so hard. And he like kind of was like,
[2027.58s -> 2038.46s]  open your eyes, open your eyes. And the Jaws animatronic is so old. It was so old and so shitty.
[2038.46s -> 2047.06s]  It was just like a sock puppet going like this. And then it would turn and go like,
[2049.38s -> 2055.38s]  it was not scary at all. It was a, it was, the thing was on fucking strings at that. It was like
[2055.38s -> 2063.13s]  the thing was built like in the fucking 70s. It didn't even look like a shark and it's gone now.
[2063.13s -> 2068.31s]  Yeah, unfortunately. So I remember that. Me and my brother just were laughing. We were like laughing
[2068.31s -> 2075.45s]  and fucking high-fiving each other and shit. But I will tell you that the Alien ride at Disney World,
[2075.45s -> 2078.89s]  I did not fuck around on that one. There was a ride at Disney World, and I'm not sure if it's
[2078.89s -> 2083.77s]  still there, it was at Epcot. It was something, it was like escape, alien escape, whatever it was
[2083.77s -> 2088.41s]  called. This is back before they rebranded it. They made it a men in black ride. But before it
[2088.41s -> 2093.77s]  was a men in black ride, it was just like an alien escapes from a fucking tube, the ride.
[2094.49s -> 2098.89s]  And I remember doing this. So I heard how scary it was. There's an alien in the fucking tube and
[2098.89s -> 2104.09s]  it breaks out, right? And the whole, the lights go dark. There's like scientists all screaming,
[2104.09s -> 2107.93s]  like he's out, he got out, run. And they have these weird sensory things where it breeze on
[2107.93s -> 2111.53s]  your neck and shit. I remember going like this. Well, here's a strategy. If you're ever scared
[2111.53s -> 2114.81s]  and you don't want to fucking see anything that's going on on the ride, here's a strat.
[2114.81s -> 2118.81s]  It's the pinky and the thumb, pinky and the thumb, pinky on the eyes. Make sure your eyes
[2118.81s -> 2128.10s]  are tight and closed. Thumb in the ears. And you won't, there's no sensations. So absolutely.
[2128.10s -> 2133.86s]  And in here, I didn't see anything. It's a foolproof tactic. Boom, boom. Like this.
[2134.58s -> 2141.82s]  Because everyone goes, Oh no, no, no. Nope. You got the pinky and the thumb technique.
[2142.62s -> 2147.22s]  And I did that the whole ride and I did, I didn't even see it. I got out of there.
[2147.22s -> 2165.58s]  Professional coward, professional coward. I was, I was like eight. You guys act like I was there.
[2165.58s -> 2174.07s]  I was there like a couple of months ago being like a scary alien. No, I was like eight or
[2174.07s -> 2178.31s]  nine years old. I was like fucking 30. Although I probably still would use that technique.
[2179.43s -> 2187.16s]  Oh, this is the wild West world. Why are you giving us tips? I'm telling you,
[2187.16s -> 2193.70s]  okay. It's not even nine year olds that you had. No, you know what? I'm getting really into it.
[2193.70s -> 2200.22s]  I go like this with my hand like that. All right. I got it. Let's play. If you have like a little
[2200.22s -> 2206.86s]  brother or I don't know, like, I don't know. I skipped this line. You can't get in here because
[2206.86s -> 2219.10s]  there are too many people. How are you supposed to ride? Ride? Do I have to buy? So you tell me I
[2219.10s -> 2224.04s]  have to buy. People should throw garbage in the garbage cans. It's pure common sense.
[2224.68s -> 2233.82s]  Do the quiz. Well, I don't know what the quiz is. I have to go get a pass. Get another E pass.
[2238.02s -> 2242.58s]  Why would you gate this game behind fucking E passes? I picked up trash.
[2243.46s -> 2253.78s]  You have to deposit the trash into the trash receptacle. Oh, nice. Do you know where you're
[2253.78s -> 2261.72s]  going next? No idea. So I'm going to go buy. How many points do I have? So I'm going to go buy
[2261.72s -> 2266.36s]  another E pass and then we're going to go do the quiz and then I'm never going to open this game
[2266.36s -> 2280.84s]  ever again. Why is a kid picking up trash? You shouldn't be doing this. Oh, I got another stamp.
[2281.98s -> 2292.92s]  Go on Jurassic Park. It's going to be tough. You hear that? There's a big crunch up here.
[2295.86s -> 2308.52s]  Jurassic Park is good. Jurassic art. Omega lull. All right. Do I really need a pass to do this?
[2310.22s -> 2320.52s]  Why do I have to? That's stupid. Can I just buy it from Woody Woodpecker? Do I have to actually
[2320.52s -> 2324.52s]  go to the very beginning? I don't have to go to the very beginning of the entrance, do I?
[2326.73s -> 2333.16s]  Oh, why? You can't get in here because there are too many people. Okay, so why? I would like to
[2333.16s -> 2343.91s]  purchase a pass from you. Just go in. Just fucking just go in. Just go in. I have to go all the way
[2343.91s -> 2362.73s]  to the beginning of the entrance. This is so... There are two hour waits in most theme parks.
[2365.66s -> 2378.84s]  Not if you do the easy pass. Not if you do the easy pass. The E pass. Go get the Jurassic
[2378.84s -> 2389.16s]  Park hat. I need a pass first. You missed bits, coward. I did actually, right? That was from
[2389.16s -> 2397.78s]  another more fucking huge money drop. 5,000 bits from Yes Is Online. Another 50 bucks.
[2398.74s -> 2402.58s]  Thank you for your insane contribution. Remember, that was part of the great movie
[2402.58s -> 2406.74s]  ride. It was a compilation of movies with actors and animatronics. They tore it down.
[2408.41s -> 2416.71s]  PepeHands. They did a lot of... They changed a lot of shit, didn't they?
[2419.16s -> 2422.44s]  Didn't they replace it with like a Fast and the Furious ride or something?
[2423.16s -> 2432.38s]  Where the hell am I going? Is it like a... You ride with the screen or something?
[2433.59s -> 2445.08s]  All right, this map is so bad. I can't even tell you where I am. I have to go this way.
[2445.72s -> 2476.94s]  Where's the entrance? Why am I so far away? There's no entrance and no exit. No, I didn't
[2476.94s -> 2488.68s]  get a cap. Get out of my way. Okay, we're almost done. Now I gotta go this way. I can't even go
[2488.68s -> 2510.22s]  this way. Left? What the fuck? I have to go there. What is this Final Fantasy VII map? Yeah, it
[2510.22s -> 2527.72s]  actually is. Dude, where the fuck? Jaws is over there, so I have to go back from Jaws. But isn't
[2527.72s -> 2548.50s]  that what I'm doing? Go to animation or right. I can't go anywhere. Okay, we're all the way out
[2548.50s -> 2560.86s]  here. I need to go down that way. Back up and bang a left. This makes no fucking sense. This
[2560.86s -> 2577.30s]  makes no sense. So I need to... I'm just going straight again. I just saw in the chat the funniest
[2577.30s -> 2581.94s]  thing I've seen all week. The funniest thing I've seen all week. Absolutely. Without a doubt. In
[2581.94s -> 2588.18s]  like the last five plus fucking streams. The funniest thing I've seen all week. You ready?
[2588.18s -> 2598.90s]  They said Olive Garden music. That's perfect. That's fucking perfect. This is exactly what
[2598.90s -> 2608.65s]  it sounds like when you're in an Olive Garden. Why is that so fucking perfect? And you see they're
[2608.65s -> 2620.44s]  eating your like your fucking tortellini and your endless soup salad and bread bowl. And then they
[2620.44s -> 2626.44s]  give you that you're out of it. Oh, I'll take the fettuccine Alfredo. Our fettuccine Alfredo.
[2626.44s -> 2633.11s]  Whipping it up with the... Our fettuccine Alfredo. Whippered up with the most delicious cheese sauce.
[2633.91s -> 2641.03s]  And the best, freshest wheat. And don't forget about our soup salad and breadsticks. Only $11.99
[2641.91s -> 2648.44s]  at your Olive Garden. We're in the neighborhood. And you order your fettuccine Alfredo when it
[2648.44s -> 2652.76s]  comes out and then fucking half the goddamn thing is cold and it's enough to feed eight people.
[2653.56s -> 2675.59s]  Where am I going? Anime voice. Get me... All right. Up here and that way. That way. But it's good. Oh,
[2675.99s -> 2683.93s]  it's absolutely delicious. It's unbelievable and it's like $12. I didn't tell you it wasn't any good.
[2689.24s -> 2692.52s]  This way. That way. This way. That way. This way. That way. This way. That way. This way. That way.
[2707.64s -> 2715.61s]  Anybody feel like I'm... I'm going in... How did I even get here? Can I please ride this?
[2720.90s -> 2734.54s]  Talk to me. Talk to me. Yes. You can see the demonstration of the climax here. Here's your
[2734.54s -> 2743.53s]  seat to see the demonstration. It starts the climax scene when you are seated. Choose your seat.
[2743.53s -> 2761.13s]  The demonstration starts when you press A. Holy shit. They don't do that. When did I choose... I
[2761.13s -> 2782.44s]  didn't even choose my seat. When do we get to see the water world demonstration? This is the water
[2782.44s -> 2814.94s]  world demonstration. Oh, this reminds me of... So, you know, in some martial art movies,
[2815.74s -> 2819.34s]  when it shows the same thing, the guy getting like punched in the face from like 12 different
[2819.34s -> 2832.23s]  camera angles. It's like bang, bang, bang, bang. I love that shit. I love that. That's what we're
[2832.23s -> 2843.18s]  seeing right here. I used to love that as a kid. Yeah. But we only got one scene though. Somebody
[2843.18s -> 2853.61s]  said, Twitch is shit. Go back to YouTube. I think you're about six years late. Yeah. All right. One
[2853.61s -> 2868.90s]  more time. One more time. Okay. Get me out. I'm done. I'm done. All right. Do I get a,
[2868.90s -> 2883.10s]  do I get a pass for that? You picked the wrong seat. 100 points though. Wow. All right. I
[2883.10s -> 2885.90s]  seriously want to spoil our Jurassic Park and I'm fucking never play this game again. I promise.
[2886.62s -> 2891.54s]  I promise I'll never play it again. I promise I'll never do it again. Just let me get,
[2891.54s -> 2903.90s]  let me do the Jurassic Park ride once. And don't forget our seasonal minstrel, Olive Garden.
[2904.54s -> 2910.68s]  When you hear, what's it? Olive Garden. What happens here stays here. What's, what's their,
[2910.68s -> 2914.36s]  what's their quote? Olive Garden. When you hear your family, that's what it is.
[2919.58s -> 2938.57s]  That would be fucking weird if that was the actual thing. Get the cap. I would,
[2938.57s -> 2946.57s]  I would love to get the cap if I could fucking find the way to the entrance. Somebody just said
[2946.57s -> 2959.51s]  with a heart, somebody loves me. What? Oh, it's garbage. How do I get out of here? I just,
[2959.51s -> 2962.15s]  I can't see the left, that left road. I can't go there. There's no way to go there.
[2963.03s -> 2965.59s]  I can't get there. It's not, it's impossible. There's no way. I need to go there from right
[2965.59s -> 2973.74s]  there. Where do I go? I can't go there. There's nowhere to go. Holy fuck. It was a tiny little
[2973.74s -> 3009.86s]  area. Burt. Uh, where are we going? Over here. Olive Garden music. I just need to know.

[3082.14s -> 3086.94s]  we make the food and deliver right to your door so you won't have to lift a.
[3096.26s -> 3103.64s]  This is definitely an Olive Garden commercial that uses this. I know it is. I've, I've heard
[3103.64s -> 3117.56s]  it a thousand times. We're going to get it and it's going to hold on. Never ending classics is back
[3117.56s -> 3124.49s]  at Olive Garden. Fuck. It's this like, it's this like warm acoustic guitar. No, no. I know what
[3124.57s -> 3130.52s]  you're talking about. They, they changed their ad platform in like, in like 2017, they changed it
[3130.52s -> 3137.58s]  from like snappy fucking restaurant to like warm. We're sitting around with an acoustic guitar.
[3137.58s -> 3144.01s]  Hold on. We're going to go back to like, we're going to go back to like 2006. Check the ad
[3144.01s -> 3148.01s]  playlist. Is there, there's an ad playlist for Olive Garden? Why the fuck would that exist?
[3155.96s -> 3161.08s]  From the home of never ending comes never. Spaghetti and meat sauce. So many of us make it.
[3161.08s -> 3166.20s]  I. Right. Put your feet up. Now get ready.
[3167.96s -> 3176.50s]  Why is it all Gordon Ramsay? Right. What happened? Why is what this playlist? Why would you have an
[3176.50s -> 3182.12s]  ad for? Okay. I'm on the official Olive Garden channel. I'm going to go back to like fucking
[3182.12s -> 3191.93s]  2009 or something. This, I know it is. Somebody's got it. You got it. You actually got it. Do you
[3191.93s -> 3195.37s]  actually fucking have this? Please tell me you haven't. Did you find it? If this is a no,

[3260.95s -> 3274.06s]  melted mozzarella and a sauce at Olive Garden. We have one rule. Everyone orders something different.
[3274.06s -> 3281.98s]  Now at Olive Garden. Why would that be a rule? Who fucking cares? Well, I wanted to get, I wanted

[3302.10s -> 3306.42s]  tradition. What's that? The one where we pass our plates to the right. When did that become a family
[3306.42s -> 3312.66s]  tradition? When you ordered that. Try Olive Garden's new grilled garlic shrimp, marinated shrimp topped
[3312.66s -> 3317.62s]  with a roasted garlic glaze or try new grilled balsamic glazed chicken. Both served over angel
[3317.62s -> 3322.26s]  hair pasta and homemade cream sauce. Two new grilled dishes with endless salad.
[3325.43s -> 3331.67s]  I love going out to dinner and ordering food and then just fucking handing it to the next person.
[3331.67s -> 3336.63s]  Why don't you just order the food you want? Why don't they make all these fucked up commercials?
