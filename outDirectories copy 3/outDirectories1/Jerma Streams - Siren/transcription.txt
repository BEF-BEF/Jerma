[0.95s -> 12.02s]  But, you know, I gotta move on and I've gotta like order 600 nuggets.
[12.02s -> 17.00s]  Alright, give me Siren. This game is gonna take like 30 hours to beat.
[17.00s -> 19.40s]  And I got some bad news for you. No, I don't.
[28.76s -> 33.00s]  Siren! This is a PS2 game. This is not a PS1 game. This game seems interesting enough.
[33.00s -> 34.76s]  And we will do facecam for this one.
[35.96s -> 37.32s]  I'm probably gonna be... What time is it?
[37.32s -> 38.20s]  That would be plenty of time.
[39.16s -> 44.02s]  I need a PS2 memory card though, that would be...
[44.98s -> 46.18s]  That would be ideal, wouldn't it?
[52.09s -> 53.69s]  You guys just want the facecam.
[56.50s -> 57.14s]  Oh, right.
[66.90s -> 78.17s]  This is not even correct.
[78.97s -> 81.32s]  But it's like too wide.
[82.04s -> 88.20s]  Well, I need to reset this.
[88.92s -> 93.37s]  Oh, there's still... There's like filters on this.
[94.01s -> 96.25s]  Oh, that's why it looks so fucking weird.
[99.35s -> 102.15s]  No DualShock 2 analog controller inserted.
[102.15s -> 104.47s]  Oh, come on. I can't use the PS1 controller for this.
[105.27s -> 106.57s]  I have to...
[116.73s -> 118.81s]  I didn't think I needed to buy one because I had a DualShock.
[131.74s -> 135.34s]  Buy a PS2 controller in all caps. I'm not going to. Ever.
[135.34s -> 138.38s]  And I'm gonna not because I want you to be very angry about it.
[149.26s -> 151.74s]  Somebody said you're a millionaire. Just buy one.
[151.74s -> 152.86s]  Well, that's not true.
[156.23s -> 157.43s]  What the fuck was that?
[159.54s -> 160.50s]  Stop doing that!
[161.14s -> 173.00s]  This is a scary game, by the way.
[173.00s -> 174.44s]  As scary as it can be.
[174.44s -> 177.40s]  I need to change this to that I'm playing Siren.
[177.40s -> 183.13s]  I don't know. What should I... Should I call it Sound the Alarm?
[183.13s -> 184.97s]  I don't know. Sound the Alarm?
[186.09s -> 186.97s]  What is this game about?
[200.41s -> 202.65s]  Really good game. Really bad voice acting.
[202.65s -> 203.15s]  Oh, okay.
[204.25s -> 207.58s]  I'm not. Okay. How about like...
[209.58s -> 210.86s]  Sound the... Whatever. Who cares?
[212.14s -> 213.34s]  Time to get up for school.
[221.69s -> 223.77s]  Okay. Well, that should be good.
[224.41s -> 226.17s]  So should this at this point.
[226.17s -> 231.14s]  We're gonna get a cutscene?
[235.77s -> 237.93s]  Well, this looks like dog shit.
[238.65s -> 243.54s]  All right. I'm gonna have to do some changes here
[243.54s -> 245.70s]  because this looks like dog shit.
[246.34s -> 250.14s]  Like... Like hard to play.
[251.10s -> 261.59s]  This is still wrong.
[261.59s -> 263.03s]  I'm like... This is still like squished.
[263.67s -> 266.46s]  Oh, I don't care. Let's go.
[267.10s -> 268.55s]  All right. This is Siren.
[269.35s -> 273.10s]  This is Blurry.
[273.66s -> 280.70s]  All right. New game.
[282.62s -> 283.66s]  Both headphones.
[283.66s -> 284.62s]  How... Is it loud?
[284.62s -> 286.30s]  It's desynced. Right. I know. I'll fix it.
[290.68s -> 291.80s]  That's a lie. It's not desynced.
[292.44s -> 296.87s]  Turn your lights off.
[306.26s -> 306.98s]  What is she doing?
[308.92s -> 309.72s]  Subtitles. Fuck.
[310.36s -> 313.40s]  Who is it?
[314.10s -> 317.96s]  This looks pretty good on PS2.
[318.60s -> 326.82s]  It's like the graphics look actually pretty damn good.
[328.63s -> 330.07s]  All right. I need to turn my lights off.
[331.80s -> 339.00s]  It's the middle of the night.
[339.00s -> 351.18s]  It's the middle of the day, guys.
[360.12s -> 360.84s]  He tricked us.
[368.95s -> 370.78s]  Who's there?
[371.56s -> 374.81s]  Son of...
[384.26s -> 385.54s]  Zombie. Turn around.
[386.74s -> 387.86s]  Is he aiming the gun?
[388.50s -> 389.70s]  Why does he have sentience?
[390.42s -> 393.02s]  Mission objective.
[393.02s -> 394.62s]  Escape from police officer.
[396.15s -> 397.19s]  That's all I got right now.
[397.75s -> 401.91s]  Okay.
[401.91s -> 407.64s]  I did it.
[409.10s -> 410.38s]  We got to see the end of that story.
[418.73s -> 419.23s]  Okay.
[420.09s -> 424.15s]  Where do I go?
[424.71s -> 430.23s]  Oh, there he is. There he is. There he is.
[430.23s -> 430.87s]  Just run away?
[430.87s -> 431.67s]  Is there a... How do I...
[431.67s -> 432.63s]  Is there like a... That's okay.
[432.63s -> 433.43s]  Circle is crouch.
[436.22s -> 437.02s]  It's shut tight.
[441.05s -> 441.77s]  It's locked.
[441.77s -> 443.69s]  I can't like hide in the porta potty?
[451.08s -> 452.60s]  Can I get in the car?
[454.68s -> 456.81s]  Did this door open?
[458.50s -> 459.78s]  Okay. The front door just opens.
[460.60s -> 461.10s]  Wait.
[461.64s -> 462.14s]  Oh, no.
[462.84s -> 467.38s]  Give me the key.
[467.38s -> 468.74s]  A car key is lying on the table.
[468.74s -> 470.90s]  Press triangle button to access the list menu.
[477.96s -> 478.46s]  Pick up.
[479.24s -> 480.44s]  We picked up the car key.
[481.24s -> 485.18s]  All right. Anything else I can grab in here?
[485.74s -> 487.72s]  Before a guy comes in and shoots me.
[488.76s -> 491.00s]  There is a copy of the town newsletter on the table.
[491.56s -> 494.71s]  Honuto community newsletter.
[494.71s -> 496.07s]  It has been added to the archive.
[497.59s -> 498.55s]  Oh, my God. He's...
[500.82s -> 501.86s]  Lockers line the wall.
[502.82s -> 506.57s]  Let's go.
[507.75s -> 508.78s]  The door is locked.
[508.78s -> 510.38s]  Press triangle at list menu.
[517.26s -> 518.38s]  Do I drive the car?
[519.98s -> 520.86s]  Used car key.
[524.84s -> 525.56s]  Get in the truck.
[528.82s -> 530.02s]  Unlock the door and not go in?
[532.98s -> 534.18s]  How do I start the car?
[537.78s -> 539.62s]  The ignition is below the steering wheel.
[541.50s -> 542.30s]  Insert the key.
[545.21s -> 547.13s]  Turn the key to start the engine.
[547.77s -> 567.48s]  Letter grade plus one.
[567.48s -> 567.96s]  Doesn't count.
[568.52s -> 569.40s]  Mission accomplished.
[571.11s -> 571.91s]  I got into the car.
[571.91s -> 572.63s]  I didn't get to drive it.
[573.35s -> 574.79s]  We saw a cut scene of the car driving.
[575.43s -> 577.02s]  Does not count.
[581.22s -> 582.02s]  Day one.
[582.02s -> 582.58s]  So this is...
[582.58s -> 583.62s]  That was yesterday.
[583.86s -> 584.42s]  This is day...
[585.06s -> 585.38s]  What are we...
[585.38s -> 586.02s]  What is that?
[586.02s -> 586.82s]  What are we getting that for?
[588.73s -> 589.45s]  24...
[590.41s -> 596.20s]  Excuse me?
[596.20s -> 596.76s]  Are you okay?
[597.56s -> 598.06s]  Hello?
[598.92s -> 599.56s]  Why would you do this?
[599.56s -> 600.60s]  The person is trying to shoot you.
[601.24s -> 602.38s]  What do I do?
[602.38s -> 603.43s]  Call an ambulance?
[604.31s -> 608.87s]  An earthquake.
[616.34s -> 618.81s]  The car driving.
[621.08s -> 621.64s]  I thought...
[621.64s -> 626.92s]  Guys, I've been listening to cars blast by driving 100 fucking miles per hour by this place.
[626.92s -> 627.96s]  And it sounds like that.
[628.12s -> 628.62s]  Oh.
[639.94s -> 642.90s]  This is Source Filmmaker meme video.
[646.30s -> 647.26s]  Yes, I'll save the game.
[657.45s -> 659.29s]  Why is it taking so long to save it?
[659.29s -> 660.33s]  Is it fake bar?
[661.21s -> 664.87s]  Okay, now we're at...
[664.87s -> 666.87s]  This is two o'clock on day one.
[668.02s -> 668.50s]  Like, what?
[668.50s -> 670.26s]  Two hours have gone by since I fell down?
[671.06s -> 680.47s]  Yes.
[680.47s -> 680.79s]  Dead.
[680.79s -> 681.27s]  I'm not dead.
[685.29s -> 686.33s]  My cam is too big.
[686.89s -> 690.95s]  Is that blood?
[691.93s -> 692.43s]  Blood.
[704.36s -> 705.08s]  Okay, you know when...
[707.14s -> 710.74s]  People are linking me images where I look like I'm fucked up.
[711.46s -> 713.62s]  How do I understand the politician thing?
[713.62s -> 718.10s]  Where like politicians would be eating like ice cream or taking a bite out of like a hot dog
[718.10s -> 720.58s]  and somebody will find the one frame where they're like...
[721.38s -> 725.56s]  You're not safe here.
[725.56s -> 726.06s]  Follow me.
[735.86s -> 743.72s]  All right, reach road.
[744.44s -> 756.62s]  This red water is now coursing through your veins in place of all the blood you lost.
[757.58s -> 758.08s]  Ugh.
[758.70s -> 761.26s]  You have the water to thank for your recovery.
[761.26s -> 762.06s]  The water.
[762.62s -> 766.62s]  I know you're still shaking, but you will be better soon.
[767.42s -> 768.94s]  I'm so relieved.
[772.06s -> 772.78s]  I'm telling you, this is...
[773.94s -> 776.63s]  Anyway, we must hurry now.
[778.62s -> 780.38s]  That's... those faces.
[780.38s -> 780.88s]  Close your eyes.
[782.97s -> 786.31s]  Relax in your thoughts.
[786.31s -> 786.81s]  You're right here.
[787.51s -> 788.38s]  You're right here.
[790.23s -> 790.87s]  Sight jack.
[790.87s -> 793.43s]  Press the L2 button to enter sight jack mode.
[794.07s -> 797.43s]  Push the left analog stick in the direction of the character to sight jack
[797.43s -> 799.27s]  and align it so that the image is visible.
[802.12s -> 804.86s]  Press zero...
[805.82s -> 809.42s]  Circle X triangle squared to assign it to a particular viewpoint.
[810.68s -> 813.48s]  The hold is canceled when the left analog stick is pushed again,
[814.52s -> 816.92s]  but can be recalled by pushing the same button again.
[821.02s -> 821.52s]  Okay.
[822.06s -> 823.42s]  Sight jack mode.
[823.42s -> 829.66s]  What the fuck is happening?
[832.65s -> 833.15s]  What?
[833.45s -> 842.46s]  Okay, I put it on X.
[843.26s -> 854.42s]  It will be a while until you can move freely.
[854.98s -> 856.26s]  That's the monster's POV.
[856.98s -> 858.10s]  Please, follow me.
[860.25s -> 860.75s]  Do you got...
[861.45s -> 863.53s]  Do you got like a spear or anything?
[864.09s -> 865.93s]  Or maybe like a broadsword?
[865.93s -> 867.05s]  I'm used to that tonight.
[869.51s -> 871.35s]  Anything, a weapon, a gun.
[871.35s -> 872.39s]  I've seen a handgun.
[873.03s -> 874.89s]  I know how to walk.
[877.30s -> 878.58s]  Go back to the burrito game.
[882.17s -> 884.89s]  Running creates more noise than walking, thus attracting the attention of enemies.
[885.85s -> 887.93s]  Follow Hisako's instructions and head to...
[888.73s -> 894.39s]  This is a very sensitive analog, too.
[894.39s -> 896.07s]  I think I'm going to do tank controls.
[896.07s -> 896.71s]  Wait here.
[897.35s -> 904.33s]  Concentrating on our surroundings.
[905.29s -> 907.53s]  So I can't watch over you the whole time.
[908.25s -> 908.97s]  Turn this up a little.
[909.93s -> 912.57s]  You'll be able to feel me calling you.
[913.37s -> 917.77s]  You can also eavesdrop with sight jack.
[919.24s -> 922.04s]  Sight jack Hisako and follow her commands.
[923.88s -> 927.43s]  Where is she?
[928.23s -> 929.91s]  Which radio station is she on?
[930.55s -> 938.65s]  I swear to God, a funny joke would be if like all of a sudden like...
[939.53s -> 942.09s]  Your local NBC news station shows up right here.
[943.69s -> 945.14s]  I just saw it.
[945.14s -> 945.54s]  Where is it?
[946.74s -> 948.30s]  Ah, shit.
[948.30s -> 948.70s]  Too much.
[948.70s -> 949.02s]  Too much.
[949.02s -> 949.42s]  Go back.
[950.06s -> 962.06s]  I just had it.
[962.94s -> 977.98s]  Gently moving the analog left and right.
[977.98s -> 981.85s]  Wait.
[982.15s -> 984.81s]  Is that her?
[985.37s -> 987.08s]  That's not her.
[988.20s -> 989.08s]  That's not her either.
[989.96s -> 990.52s]  Is that her?
[991.72s -> 998.44s]  What did she say?
[999.32s -> 1021.37s]  Where'd she go?
[1026.10s -> 1026.60s]  Alright.
[1030.70s -> 1031.82s]  Why am I so out of breath?
[1031.82s -> 1033.90s]  I haven't even moved in like five minutes.
[1040.30s -> 1041.10s]  Are you shitting me?
[1042.47s -> 1046.97s]  I have to tap into the radio waves to find out where they are.
[1047.69s -> 1055.61s]  What the fuck was that?
[1055.61s -> 1056.33s]  There was a noise.
[1056.33s -> 1057.45s]  There was a noise in the room.
[1080.39s -> 1081.03s]  There's an issue.
[1084.41s -> 1091.64s]  Because there's like 30 Kinect games all over the floor.
[1091.64s -> 1092.28s]  I still haven't...
[1094.36s -> 1095.48s]  It could be anywhere.
[1095.48s -> 1097.32s]  Whatever it is, it could be anywhere.
[1110.60s -> 1112.12s]  This is why I don't ever have two headphones in.
[1112.12s -> 1113.80s]  I need to be completely aware of my surroundings.
[1131.98s -> 1133.34s]  How long ago was that stream?
[1133.34s -> 1134.54s]  Was that three months ago?
[1136.25s -> 1142.34s]  Well, because I didn't finish it.
[1142.34s -> 1142.98s]  Alright, let's go.
[1145.69s -> 1151.78s]  That was not three months ago.
[1152.42s -> 1154.55s]  That was like a month and a half ago.
[1166.87s -> 1167.67s]  How do I turn it off?
[1169.03s -> 1170.87s]  Square is the flashlight on and off.
[1170.87s -> 1173.91s]  Turning the flashlight off will decrease the chances of being spotted by enemies.
[1174.79s -> 1177.75s]  However, using a gun in the dark will decrease accuracy.
[1179.08s -> 1179.88s]  Oh, that is...
[1180.92s -> 1182.60s]  Is this a flashlight or a floodlight?
[1182.60s -> 1185.64s]  Because that is a huge amount of light I don't have.
[1186.60s -> 1188.97s]  I don't know where she went.
[1188.97s -> 1189.45s]  Where'd she go?
[1198.47s -> 1200.95s]  Climb up onto the roof and turn towards Hisako.
[1201.85s -> 1202.41s]  Be careful.
[1202.41s -> 1204.81s]  Pushing the left analogs are too far will cause you to climb back down.
[1205.69s -> 1207.82s]  Okay.
[1207.82s -> 1212.15s]  If the companion is a distance away, wait until they are near the appropriate spot.
[1213.03s -> 1215.86s]  That's not...
[1215.86s -> 1216.36s]  Hey!
[1217.67s -> 1218.31s]  That's Shout.
[1226.78s -> 1227.82s]  Oh, I have to get up there first.
[1236.86s -> 1237.50s]  Alright, get up.
[1238.30s -> 1241.40s]  Why can't she just climb up?
[1241.40s -> 1242.44s]  I don't know.
[1242.44s -> 1244.49s]  I'm alright.
[1244.49s -> 1250.38s]  Alright, pull up.
[1252.82s -> 1255.93s]  This game looks like it sucked.
[1255.93s -> 1256.57s]  I'm leaving.
[1260.12s -> 1260.68s]  Thanks for coming.
[1263.74s -> 1266.38s]  Alright, press square for more detailed instructions.
[1267.18s -> 1268.47s]  Okay.
[1268.47s -> 1273.99s]  I feel like I need to...
[1273.99s -> 1276.15s]  This is what it's like when you don't have your glasses on.
[1276.79s -> 1282.95s]  Okay.
[1282.95s -> 1286.62s]  I can't.
[1287.34s -> 1288.62s]  R1 and X is attack.
[1289.34s -> 1291.83s]  So holding R1 and X is attack.
[1291.83s -> 1292.95s]  R1 is draw weapon.
[1294.07s -> 1296.79s]  And it's also lock on if an enemy is within a target area.
[1298.39s -> 1300.87s]  Okay, R1 button plus the left analog stick is directional.
[1300.87s -> 1301.19s]  Okay.
[1301.99s -> 1303.70s]  Okay, move sideways.
[1303.70s -> 1305.78s]  L2 is enter sight jack mode.
[1306.74s -> 1307.46s]  Alright, I think I'm ready.
[1311.19s -> 1311.35s]  What?
[1311.35s -> 1312.07s]  Let me sight jack.
[1313.11s -> 1315.64s]  Alright.
[1315.64s -> 1317.32s]  There's more monsters though.
[1323.32s -> 1324.28s]  Is that a sniper?
[1324.28s -> 1325.64s]  Is that a crosshair on my head?
[1326.44s -> 1330.52s]  There's a monster in here.
[1331.08s -> 1338.20s]  Where is she?
[1338.76s -> 1340.86s]  Oh, it's you.
[1341.50s -> 1342.22s]  Oh, it's her.
[1343.50s -> 1344.22s]  Okay.
[1344.22s -> 1352.31s]  What time is it now?
[1352.31s -> 1362.68s]  The crosshair is basically located for where you are
[1362.68s -> 1364.92s]  compared to whatever you're sight jacking.
[1364.92s -> 1365.56s]  Oh, okay.
[1366.12s -> 1366.76s]  That makes sense.
[1367.56s -> 1373.46s]  Alright, so now this is day one.
[1374.26s -> 1376.92s]  Tam and...
[1376.92s -> 1380.76s]  So this is the same time, but this is a different person.
[1381.32s -> 1382.47s]  Professor?
[1383.43s -> 1384.63s]  What is this place?
[1385.19s -> 1385.91s]  Where are we?
[1387.11s -> 1388.39s]  I just don't get it.
[1389.19s -> 1389.75s]  What's going on?
[1389.75s -> 1391.11s]  The eyes moving back and forth.
[1391.75s -> 1393.19s]  I told you to wait in the car.
[1394.15s -> 1395.35s]  But what's happening?
[1396.23s -> 1397.03s]  What is this?
[1397.83s -> 1399.19s]  Why is this happening?
[1399.19s -> 1401.35s]  This is exactly why I told you not to come.
[1401.35s -> 1404.07s]  Professor, we need to find the villagers.
[1404.07s -> 1405.43s]  They must be panicking.
[1407.69s -> 1408.73s]  Please shut up.
[1413.24s -> 1414.52s]  Somebody's sight jacking.
[1423.54s -> 1427.14s]  From now on, you will do exactly as I tell you.
[1428.78s -> 1429.26s]  What?
[1429.26s -> 1431.74s]  Until I call you, keep your eyes closed and stay still.
[1432.38s -> 1433.10s]  Do you understand?
[1433.98s -> 1444.81s]  Professor, a real gun?
[1446.01s -> 1446.33s]  No.
[1446.97s -> 1448.15s]  It's fake.
[1449.88s -> 1450.68s]  Okay, come on.
[1451.40s -> 1452.46s]  Okay.
[1457.08s -> 1457.88s]  They always ask that.
[1458.44s -> 1459.77s]  Is that a real gun?
[1460.33s -> 1464.14s]  That's one time I just wanted to not be.
[1466.14s -> 1468.94s]  No, it's part of a costume.
[1469.66s -> 1471.26s]  I did a Wild West thing.
[1471.90s -> 1474.65s]  It's just been in my bag ever since.
[1474.65s -> 1475.69s]  I haven't cleaned out my bag.
[1475.69s -> 1477.05s]  Have you seen my fucking connect room?
[1483.42s -> 1486.70s]  Reach road to Kuruwari with Yoriko Anno.
[1488.54s -> 1492.70s]  So I'm supposed to concentrate and...
[1492.70s -> 1493.58s]  What the fuck was that?
[1493.58s -> 1495.02s]  ...and listen to your voice.
[1495.02s -> 1496.14s]  Somebody just shot me.
[1497.98s -> 1499.10s]  Somebody shot me with a gun.
[1500.06s -> 1500.86s]  Did you shoot me?
[1501.74s -> 1503.61s]  Who shot me with a gun?
[1504.25s -> 1504.75s]  What?
[1525.74s -> 1526.46s]  What's going on?
[1527.50s -> 1535.82s]  All right, I keep...
[1537.03s -> 1538.23s]  Going back is too dangerous.
[1539.03s -> 1547.83s]  I...
[1547.83s -> 1548.23s]  Okay, I...
[1554.62s -> 1555.18s]  It was me.
[1555.74s -> 1556.38s]  It was me.
[1560.07s -> 1563.51s]  Okay, the two...
[1564.15s -> 1566.25s]  I can see the two crosshairs.
[1566.25s -> 1570.04s]  I'm supposed to concentrate.
[1571.32s -> 1572.28s]  Where is that person?
[1574.49s -> 1575.29s]  Oh, there you are.
[1576.33s -> 1576.81s]  Where are you?
[1576.81s -> 1577.53s]  All right.
[1577.53s -> 1578.17s]  So you're in...
[1578.97s -> 1582.20s]  Okay, I'm over there.
[1583.16s -> 1584.04s]  So he's to the right.
[1589.13s -> 1589.69s]  That's us.
[1590.84s -> 1593.08s]  So he's up like that way.
[1593.08s -> 1593.96s]  He's up there.
[1594.92s -> 1595.88s]  Like up there.
[1596.52s -> 1597.48s]  How do I get by this?
[1598.20s -> 1609.02s]  Where's the other guy?
[1609.66s -> 1612.36s]  There's two.
[1614.04s -> 1619.03s]  Okay, that's...
[1619.03s -> 1620.15s]  All right, I'm gonna put you on square.
[1623.34s -> 1624.78s]  So then that's...
[1625.58s -> 1626.87s]  Okay, I've got X.
[1627.51s -> 1628.15s]  And square.
[1630.79s -> 1632.39s]  Okay, now I want to find the other one.
[1633.43s -> 1635.03s]  There's somebody walking around.
[1637.27s -> 1637.67s]  Right here.
[1637.67s -> 1638.47s]  Okay, circle.
[1639.75s -> 1641.27s]  So I've got square.
[1641.91s -> 1642.71s]  Square is her.
[1643.67s -> 1644.63s]  X is sniper.
[1645.27s -> 1647.19s]  Circle is person walking around.
[1648.23s -> 1653.64s]  She needs to follow me?
[1657.61s -> 1658.09s]  Come here.
[1659.86s -> 1660.36s]  Hey!
[1663.82s -> 1665.18s]  You coming?
[1667.54s -> 1668.42s]  Don't get sniped.
[1668.98s -> 1672.82s]  Why are you going...
[1672.82s -> 1673.32s]  What was that?
[1673.94s -> 1680.97s]  Okay, let's go.
[1682.49s -> 1684.31s]  That's it.
[1684.31s -> 1685.91s]  I don't have anything else on the radio, right?
[1685.91s -> 1687.03s]  There's only two enemies.
[1690.95s -> 1691.91s]  Okay, stay with me.
[1694.71s -> 1695.91s]  I do have a gun.
[1695.91s -> 1706.62s]  I hate this.
[1706.62s -> 1707.58s]  I don't even know where that is.
[1708.46s -> 1721.70s]  Should I go this way?
[1722.50s -> 1723.30s]  I can't go this way.
[1724.02s -> 1729.11s]  I don't get sniped either.
[1731.08s -> 1732.12s]  You can fall off this edge.
[1732.12s -> 1732.92s]  Don't fucking do that.
[1737.35s -> 1738.55s]  All right, he's at the house.
[1739.19s -> 1741.82s]  There's like a crate in a house.
[1745.74s -> 1747.02s]  Aim, head to...
[1747.66s -> 1748.16s]  Okay.
[1750.50s -> 1752.23s]  Wait, where is that?
[1752.87s -> 1754.10s]  There's a well here.
[1763.50s -> 1764.70s]  Move around so I can see where I am.
[1766.73s -> 1768.01s]  Oh my god, we're right there.
[1768.73s -> 1769.37s]  What do we do?
[1769.37s -> 1769.85s]  What do we do?
[1769.85s -> 1770.35s]  What do we do?
[1771.61s -> 1772.33s]  Where are we hidden?
[1772.97s -> 1773.85s]  Are we hidden at all?
[1780.33s -> 1780.97s]  Can he see us?
[1793.02s -> 1793.82s]  He can't...
[1793.82s -> 1794.62s]  Shoot him!
[1795.32s -> 1802.20s]  Is it dead?
[1802.82s -> 1808.42s]  It looks like it's just down.
[1808.42s -> 1809.06s]  Okay, let's go.
[1809.62s -> 1810.82s]  I'm not going to stand around and find out.
[1810.82s -> 1811.32s]  Let's go.
[1811.86s -> 1812.58s]  Where's the sniper?
[1813.30s -> 1815.43s]  Can't see us.
[1815.43s -> 1815.93s]  All right, let's go.
[1816.55s -> 1824.17s]  Are there any more monsters?
[1824.17s -> 1825.21s]  Probably not, right?
[1825.21s -> 1825.77s]  They can't be.
[1826.41s -> 1827.13s]  Which way do I go?
[1827.93s -> 1831.93s]  Wasn't Jerma playing as a little kid earlier?
[1832.73s -> 1833.61s]  Wait, don't go that way.
[1835.14s -> 1835.86s]  Holy fuck.
[1835.86s -> 1836.90s]  Oh my god.
[1836.90s -> 1837.46s]  Oh my god.
[1837.46s -> 1837.94s]  Oh my god.
[1837.94s -> 1838.42s]  This way.
[1838.42s -> 1839.06s]  Don't go that way.
[1851.67s -> 1852.87s]  I'm going to tap into the...
[1853.91s -> 1855.19s]  And see if there's anything else I can...
[1857.51s -> 1858.01s]  What?
[1858.47s -> 1859.75s]  Oh my goodness, there's other people.
[1861.50s -> 1862.00s]  Shoot.
[1870.07s -> 1871.11s]  Okay, let me tap in.
[1872.71s -> 1886.46s]  Sniper, is that it?
[1887.18s -> 1890.09s]  It's you.
[1891.11s -> 1893.52s]  What is this?
[1897.90s -> 1899.26s]  Oh, there's a person on the ground.
[1899.26s -> 1900.06s]  Okay, I get it.
[1900.06s -> 1900.56s]  Go.
[1901.10s -> 1912.18s]  Don't move, don't move.
[1912.18s -> 1912.68s]  Don't move.
[1913.62s -> 1921.66s]  There's something else here.
[1922.38s -> 1926.62s]  Who the hell are you?
[1926.62s -> 1927.12s]  No, it's you.
[1931.72s -> 1932.52s]  Oh, I hate this.
[1934.71s -> 1935.91s]  I really don't like this.
[1950.02s -> 1953.06s]  There's a radio on the shelf that appears to be broken and only receives static.
[1955.11s -> 1955.61s]  That's it?
[1958.33s -> 1959.77s]  There doesn't appear to be anything useful here.
[1959.77s -> 1960.65s]  There's nothing else in here?
[1961.29s -> 1967.08s]  I can't talk.
[1968.33s -> 1969.53s]  Looks like there's a book right here.
[1970.17s -> 1971.45s]  There's an old album.
[1972.17s -> 1973.93s]  Nothing about it particularly catches your attention.
[1977.21s -> 1977.93s]  Look behind you.
[1984.17s -> 1985.53s]  Okay, I'm not gonna lie.
[1987.90s -> 1992.68s]  I thought that right there.
[1994.71s -> 1996.55s]  This, I thought, see that black right there?
[1996.55s -> 1998.55s]  I thought that was Kim behind me.
[1998.55s -> 1999.83s]  About to like grab me.
[2007.42s -> 2011.88s]  So what am I supposed to do here?
[2012.84s -> 2014.20s]  I just have to get out of here, right?
[2014.20s -> 2015.96s]  But I can't, can I?
[2015.96s -> 2016.46s]  Wait.
[2016.76s -> 2017.88s]  I have a context menu.
[2020.66s -> 2021.16s]  Hide.
[2021.62s -> 2024.99s]  Pick up.
[2025.61s -> 2028.60s]  You picked up the broken radio.
[2029.96s -> 2030.46s]  Junk.
[2031.16s -> 2033.80s]  Can I pick up the book?
[2034.44s -> 2039.40s]  I don't think so.
[2039.40s -> 2040.52s]  All right, I have the radio.
[2041.24s -> 2042.36s]  All right, come here.
[2042.36s -> 2055.53s]  All right, let me see where they are.
[2056.65s -> 2059.59s]  He's always up top there.
[2060.47s -> 2062.62s]  They're still on the ground.
[2062.62s -> 2063.98s]  And you, well, I don't even know what you got.
[2063.98s -> 2065.02s]  You're walking around the shed.
[2066.14s -> 2068.07s]  Can I go down here?
[2068.79s -> 2074.49s]  Well, I need to help you, don't I?
[2079.69s -> 2080.97s]  No, all right, you can do it.
[2080.97s -> 2081.47s]  Good.
[2083.90s -> 2084.40s]  Wait a minute.
[2085.74s -> 2088.89s]  Is this right here?
[2091.19s -> 2095.66s]  Turn around so I can see if this is right here.
[2096.54s -> 2099.07s]  It is.
[2100.17s -> 2101.37s]  It is, it is, it is, it is.
[2101.37s -> 2102.33s]  Okay, all right, it is.
[2102.33s -> 2102.83s]  Get over here.
[2108.20s -> 2109.48s]  So we're behind that side.
[2112.58s -> 2117.91s]  Which way did they go?
[2119.03s -> 2124.70s]  Did they turn around from here?
[2125.50s -> 2129.72s]  All right, they're gonna be right here.
[2130.44s -> 2140.78s]  Fuck.
[2141.62s -> 2142.12s]  Where are they?
[2142.66s -> 2144.30s]  Where are you?
[2144.30s -> 2145.10s]  What are you doing?
[2145.10s -> 2147.34s]  Don't put your hands up like that.
[2148.54s -> 2150.24s]  Where are they?
[2155.30s -> 2157.78s]  I think we should get moving.
[2157.78s -> 2158.28s]  Shh!
[2167.37s -> 2176.04s]  Where'd you go?
[2176.68s -> 2178.09s]  Where did they go?
[2179.53s -> 2180.25s]  Where are they?
[2181.88s -> 2182.52s]  Where are they?
[2184.04s -> 2186.60s]  Are they behind the shed?
[2187.32s -> 2190.26s]  There you are, there you are.
[2198.38s -> 2199.58s]  Run!
[2199.58s -> 2200.94s]  It's time to run!
[2200.94s -> 2201.44s]  Run!
[2202.14s -> 2202.64s]  Run!
[2203.42s -> 2203.92s]  Run!
[2204.38s -> 2204.88s]  Run!
[2205.26s -> 2205.76s]  Run!
[2206.30s -> 2206.86s]  No, don't!
[2206.86s -> 2207.36s]  This way!
[2208.06s -> 2213.72s]  Hurry up!
[2218.06s -> 2218.56s]  Hello?
[2221.90s -> 2222.40s]  The...
[2226.54s -> 2227.34s]  They tripped.
[2236.28s -> 2236.78s]  All right.
[2242.81s -> 2245.13s]  Still this person on the bridge with the rifle.
[2245.77s -> 2248.01s]  All right, where do I need to go though?
[2248.01s -> 2248.51s]  I need to get...
[2250.48s -> 2250.98s]  In...
[2251.76s -> 2252.48s]  What's the mission?
[2252.48s -> 2253.44s]  Get out of here, right?
[2254.32s -> 2256.12s]  Did I miss something up here?
[2260.99s -> 2262.03s]  Classic snipers.
[2262.67s -> 2265.77s]  I keep running into doors.
[2269.72s -> 2270.84s]  What's the actual mission?
[2276.16s -> 2277.52s]  Reach the road to...
[2277.52s -> 2278.72s]  Okay, reach the road.
[2280.25s -> 2282.33s]  All right, so is that right over here?
[2286.20s -> 2287.40s]  Why is this person standing up?
[2292.72s -> 2293.36s]  Where's my friend?
[2294.32s -> 2298.86s]  Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.
[2304.52s -> 2306.14s]  I don't even know where that person is.
[2313.84s -> 2314.34s]  Come on.
[2315.06s -> 2317.90s]  Objectives.
[2318.70s -> 2319.18s]  Do I have to...
[2319.18s -> 2320.06s]  Do I have no bullets at all?
[2321.23s -> 2321.71s]  I'm done.
[2321.71s -> 2322.59s]  I have no bullets.
[2322.59s -> 2323.09s]  I'm out.
[2328.83s -> 2329.71s]  Where did...
[2329.71s -> 2330.51s]  Where did she go?
[2333.10s -> 2334.46s]  Because this is where we came from.
[2335.50s -> 2336.06s]  Are you here?
[2336.62s -> 2337.12s]  Hey!
[2338.30s -> 2338.80s]  Where are you?
[2345.65s -> 2346.15s]  Oh.
[2349.71s -> 2350.35s]  Is she dead?
[2350.35s -> 2351.71s]  I need to find her signal.
[2352.43s -> 2354.27s]  I'm out of bullets.
[2357.73s -> 2362.77s]  Okay.
[2362.77s -> 2364.85s]  This is gonna be a really, really odd reference.
[2365.97s -> 2366.47s]  But...
[2367.52s -> 2371.04s]  He sounds like that old British cartoon character, Mr. Bloppy.
[2378.29s -> 2385.46s]  I gotta find her sequence.
[2385.46s -> 2386.34s]  Where is she?
[2387.30s -> 2387.80s]  Is this her?
[2390.00s -> 2392.08s]  Oh, she's just standing in that same spot.
[2395.88s -> 2397.84s]  The sniper.
[2399.49s -> 2401.09s]  Oh shit, the sniper.
[2401.09s -> 2402.13s]  This is gonna be the sniper.
[2411.06s -> 2413.89s]  Fuck.
[2413.89s -> 2414.53s]  Reach the road.
[2414.53s -> 2415.73s]  I gotta go wrap around.
[2415.73s -> 2420.77s]  So, I'm supposed to concentrate and listen to your voice.
[2420.77s -> 2421.65s]  I was there.
[2421.65s -> 2424.29s]  Well, I'm doing something kind of strange.
[2424.29s -> 2425.09s]  All right, let's just go.
[2425.65s -> 2426.45s]  I know where I'm going.
[2427.49s -> 2431.94s]  Who saw me?
[2432.80s -> 2435.80s]  I got you.
[2436.52s -> 2440.40s]  I got...
[2440.40s -> 2441.36s]  Okay, you are X.
[2443.80s -> 2446.68s]  You're gonna be square.
[2447.88s -> 2448.88s]  Okay, let's move.
[2449.52s -> 2454.85s]  You're looking more defo than Franco.
[2458.18s -> 2458.68s]  All right.
[2460.55s -> 2462.23s]  Why do I know about Mr. Bloppy?
[2462.79s -> 2467.08s]  Because I know everything.
[2470.84s -> 2471.34s]  All right.
[2471.96s -> 2479.00s]  Give me a topic.
[2481.86s -> 2483.38s]  Okay, I made it across the bank.
[2484.10s -> 2486.57s]  Come here.
[2487.11s -> 2488.55s]  Now, we're just gonna go this way.
[2488.55s -> 2489.67s]  I gotta get the radio.
[2491.52s -> 2492.00s]  He knows.
[2492.00s -> 2492.80s]  Ah, can you give me a talk?
[2492.80s -> 2493.60s]  Throw a topic over here.
[2497.06s -> 2501.16s]  What's the RGB code for magenta?
[2502.29s -> 2509.17s]  Uh, pound pound or pound FF 0022234FH.
[2517.00s -> 2518.84s]  I almost shot her.
[2518.84s -> 2523.43s]  That's the hex idiot.
[2523.43s -> 2524.47s]  I'm sorry, I was going...
[2524.47s -> 2526.63s]  I'm sorry, I was going next level on you.
[2526.63s -> 2527.43s]  All right, where am I going?
[2528.07s -> 2528.79s]  All right, this is...
[2530.07s -> 2531.43s]  This is a pay attention game.
[2531.43s -> 2532.15s]  I have to pay attention.
[2532.15s -> 2532.63s]  So, I'm gonna go...
[2533.43s -> 2534.07s]  Can I open this?
[2534.79s -> 2537.84s]  Is this like a mailbox?
[2538.56s -> 2543.38s]  What's the hex?
[2543.38s -> 2544.26s]  That's hex not...
[2545.62s -> 2546.58s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[2547.38s -> 2553.38s]  What's the RGB?
[2554.10s -> 2556.12s]  Wait a minute.
[2556.74s -> 2558.06s]  The sniper.
[2558.84s -> 2570.10s]  You're not gonna shoot me in the head, are you?
[2570.10s -> 2594.79s]  So, I'm supposed to concentrate and listen to your voice.
[2595.43s -> 2595.99s]  So, how do I...
[2596.55s -> 2597.91s]  How do I get up there without them knowing?
[2597.91s -> 2599.03s]  Something kind of strange.
[2600.31s -> 2602.92s]  Hey, just got here.
[2602.92s -> 2603.80s]  How long has he been streaming?
[2603.80s -> 2605.88s]  Oh, like three and a half hours, just about.
[2610.00s -> 2610.40s]  So, what the...
[2610.40s -> 2611.12s]  What am I...
[2611.12s -> 2612.64s]  I guess I don't even have to take him out.
[2612.64s -> 2613.28s]  Just keep going.
[2614.40s -> 2615.28s]  Because this...
[2615.28s -> 2616.48s]  I get around him.
[2617.04s -> 2617.52s]  Right here.
[2620.96s -> 2622.64s]  So, I'm just gonna keep moving forward.
[2635.64s -> 2640.92s]  Why does he know that?
[2648.74s -> 2649.62s]  Right, that's good.
[2649.62s -> 2650.74s]  Can I open this door?
[2650.74s -> 2651.86s]  No, it's ported.
[2651.86s -> 2652.73s]  But why?
[2653.35s -> 2654.31s]  Why do I know that?
[2655.11s -> 2655.88s]  Just do.
[2656.60s -> 2660.77s]  Why can I do the ABCs backwards?
[2660.77s -> 2678.00s]  Z-X-Y-W-Q-T-S-V-U-T-O-P-N-L-O-A-G-H-A-B-C-A.
[2678.00s -> 2678.88s]  Why can I do that?
[2678.88s -> 2679.38s]  Shit.
[2680.71s -> 2684.71s]  Sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper.
[2684.71s -> 2685.21s]  Turn the light on.
[2686.07s -> 2692.25s]  Made it.
[2692.63s -> 2696.10s]  Okay, this is where the other guy is.
[2696.82s -> 2707.92s]  All right, I see.
[2708.80s -> 2715.35s]  You should...
[2715.35s -> 2716.79s]  You should do a blobby stream.
[2717.51s -> 2718.31s]  What does that even mean?
[2719.27s -> 2729.67s]  Somebody else is there.
[2730.79s -> 2732.34s]  I want to know where they are.
[2732.34s -> 2736.66s]  You are down.
[2739.54s -> 2743.16s]  Okay.
[2745.24s -> 2749.60s]  And the sniper is still available, but we don't even care about the sniper.
[2749.60s -> 2750.10s]  Let's go.
[2750.96s -> 2755.08s]  It's the radio.
[2756.04s -> 2757.49s]  I remember this.
[2758.93s -> 2759.57s]  I remember this.
[2760.53s -> 2761.33s]  Pick up the radio.
[2762.21s -> 2764.08s]  No, no, no, come here.
[2769.28s -> 2770.48s]  Okay, I have the broken radio.
[2770.48s -> 2772.08s]  What's it got to do with that piece of junk?
[2773.65s -> 2775.17s]  I really don't know.
[2775.17s -> 2775.97s]  I have no idea.
[2776.29s -> 2778.61s]  But this is kind of the end of the line here.
[2784.76s -> 2785.88s]  I guess I could go...
[2785.88s -> 2786.84s]  Can I go around here?
[2790.29s -> 2792.29s]  Is there anywhere else I can go down here?
[2796.45s -> 2797.73s]  What, am I stream going down?
[2801.38s -> 2803.38s]  I guess, okay, I could go down this way.
[2803.38s -> 2803.94s]  There's a guy.
[2803.94s -> 2804.44s]  Where is he?
[2806.55s -> 2808.23s]  He's right next to the tower here.
[2808.87s -> 2810.45s]  No, he's not.
[2810.45s -> 2810.95s]  Where is he?
[2811.57s -> 2815.57s]  I have plenty of ammo.
[2815.57s -> 2816.53s]  In fact, I'm going to reload.
[2817.33s -> 2822.58s]  No, I just want to say F.
[2823.30s -> 2824.61s]  Oh, all right.
[2827.80s -> 2829.24s]  All right, there's another guy here.
[2829.96s -> 2838.36s]  Nothing else around here.
[2840.18s -> 2841.06s]  Okay, where is that?
[2841.62s -> 2842.12s]  There you are.
[2842.98s -> 2854.47s]  Bring us back here.
[2855.11s -> 2858.16s]  I haven't been in here yet.
[2861.52s -> 2862.02s]  So...
[2863.46s -> 2864.98s]  Oh, that's the sniper.
[2865.78s -> 2868.15s]  How the fuck do I get out of here?
[2870.28s -> 2873.62s]  Oh, drop down here and then bang right.
[2874.60s -> 2875.10s]  Right?
[2875.56s -> 2876.06s]  Okay.
[2876.68s -> 2877.94s]  All right, I made it.
[2877.94s -> 2878.50s]  This is the end.
[2879.30s -> 2886.44s]  We have to sneak over here and then bang right.
[2887.08s -> 2890.82s]  I don't think he sees us.
[2891.70s -> 2893.60s]  Because this is the road, right?
[2893.60s -> 2894.10s]  This is the...
[2894.72s -> 2898.90s]  Who's doing that?
[2902.84s -> 2903.64s]  So confused.
[2904.44s -> 2906.74s]  No, I did this already.
[2908.23s -> 2909.91s]  So what the fuck am I supposed to be doing?
[2910.63s -> 2921.33s]  It's like, oh, go to this next area.
[2921.33s -> 2922.29s]  But where is it?
[2924.42s -> 2925.94s]  This is back where the radio was.
[2928.79s -> 2929.91s]  Oh, there you go.
[2930.55s -> 2935.80s]  I have a map, do I?
[2936.52s -> 2946.58s]  All right, now we're jumping back to Kyo-Yo.
[2950.93s -> 2951.73s]  It's not a dream.
[2953.49s -> 2953.99s]  Are we winning?
[2954.61s -> 2956.77s]  Um, sort of.
[2956.77s -> 2957.27s]  Okay.
[2957.75s -> 2959.05s]  What do we do now?
[2960.07s -> 2963.83s]  All we can do is wait here until Makino and the others arrive.
[2966.58s -> 2967.08s]  Are you...
[2968.22s -> 2969.50s]  Is this a place of worship?
[2970.22s -> 2971.82s]  I mean, it kind of looks like one.
[2971.82s -> 2973.42s]  But it's different from the other ones I've seen.
[2974.44s -> 2978.20s]  It may seem strange, but this is our faith.
[2979.56s -> 2984.23s]  Well, I don't know anything about it.
[2984.23s -> 2985.43s]  So what a random pose.
[2986.39s -> 2987.51s]  It must be a sign.
[2988.31s -> 2992.15s]  Outsiders like you don't normally possess the sight.
[2999.06s -> 2999.56s]  Stereo.
[3000.42s -> 3000.92s]  Stereo.
[3001.94s -> 3003.14s]  Audio, I heard that over there.
[3003.86s -> 3011.42s]  Book of Deliverance, Chaos at the End Times has been added to your archive.
[3012.46s -> 3013.74s]  Okay.
[3013.74s -> 3019.46s]  I won't be reading it, but at least I know it's there.
[3030.17s -> 3031.13s]  A new character.
[3031.77s -> 3036.65s]  We keep getting new...
[3036.65s -> 3037.21s]  I can't even...
[3037.21s -> 3041.05s]  I can't establish any relationship with any of these characters.
[3041.05s -> 3041.85s]  We've seen too many of them.
[3044.81s -> 3051.88s]  What's this?
[3052.58s -> 3055.63s]  What's this?
[3058.76s -> 3059.80s]  My ears.
[3059.80s -> 3061.16s]  All right, reach the road.
[3061.96s -> 3063.48s]  I've just reached the road.
[3063.48s -> 3064.52s]  Head towards the road.
[3065.48s -> 3066.71s]  I don't have anything.
[3066.71s -> 3067.67s]  I don't have any weapons.
[3069.22s -> 3069.86s]  I'm just a guy.
[3071.16s -> 3071.66s]  Wait.
[3073.27s -> 3075.77s]  Everybody seems to have this power though.
[3077.54s -> 3091.24s]  Are they gonna fight?
[3112.47s -> 3118.82s]  There's so many people here.
[3125.82s -> 3126.38s]  I said...
[3127.59s -> 3129.11s]  Some of these people said, I can't hear you.
[3129.75s -> 3130.63s]  Never mind.
[3130.63s -> 3133.59s]  It was just for a second, I thought, why did that kid pan?
[3133.59s -> 3136.23s]  The camera went down and I thought he...
[3136.23s -> 3136.71s]  I don't know.
[3137.43s -> 3144.33s]  I don't even have a flashlight.
[3144.97s -> 3155.24s]  Oh shit.
[3155.24s -> 3155.96s]  Is there a sniper?
[3157.96s -> 3168.55s]  All right, somebody's at the end of this bridge.
[3169.51s -> 3173.94s]  No, it's not a bridge.
[3173.94s -> 3175.06s]  What an optical illusion.
[3175.06s -> 3176.42s]  I thought that was a street lamp.
[3177.54s -> 3183.72s]  I think it's safe this way.
[3184.52s -> 3187.30s]  Can I push these over?
[3188.02s -> 3190.02s]  There are gas cylinders here.
[3190.02s -> 3190.82s]  I don't shout.
[3191.62s -> 3198.70s]  Don't go into the light.
[3198.70s -> 3199.74s]  I'm gonna try not to.
[3202.28s -> 3204.04s]  That's the person with the mallet.
[3206.09s -> 3206.59s]  Okay.
[3206.59s -> 3207.09s]  Okay.
[3208.76s -> 3210.84s]  Just get to the place I need to be.
[3212.68s -> 3214.20s]  And this doesn't open.
[3214.20s -> 3215.00s]  There's a ladder.
[3216.28s -> 3225.50s]  No, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[3225.50s -> 3226.30s]  Stop doing that.
[3226.30s -> 3226.86s]  Open the door.
[3228.06s -> 3231.30s]  The person...
[3232.88s -> 3238.12s]  How do I get up?
[3238.84s -> 3243.69s]  I think I have to go up this way.
[3244.49s -> 3247.18s]  The person fell off the roof.
[3251.26s -> 3261.73s]  Okay.
[3262.97s -> 3263.53s]  What should I do?
[3264.41s -> 3270.33s]  Is there anything up here?
[3270.33s -> 3271.61s]  Like a gun or something?
[3272.57s -> 3274.78s]  Okay, they're climbing up here.
[3275.42s -> 3276.22s]  How do I push?
[3280.25s -> 3282.09s]  They're all coming up here at the same time.
[3282.81s -> 3290.11s]  There's too many up here.
[3296.92s -> 3297.96s]  Cast a spell.
[3306.88s -> 3307.68s]  Stupefy.
[3311.48s -> 3312.68s]  Oh my god.
[3312.68s -> 3314.52s]  That was, that was very funny.
[3315.32s -> 3316.76s]  That was really funny.
[3318.08s -> 3319.12s]  Cast a spell.
[3319.92s -> 3322.46s]  I lost my wand though.
[3323.84s -> 3325.20s]  So I obviously have to go up there.
[3325.20s -> 3326.80s]  And I, this is just a runaway.
[3327.60s -> 3328.65s]  There is a sniper.
[3329.61s -> 3330.49s]  Where are you?
[3331.74s -> 3332.78s]  Where's the sniper?
[3333.42s -> 3338.97s]  The sniper was probably up in the roost that I climbed up.
[3339.77s -> 3340.81s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[3341.37s -> 3343.69s]  An old lady just killed me with a fucking mallet.
[3343.69s -> 3344.41s]  What is that?
[3344.41s -> 3345.21s]  I don't even know what you're holding.
[3352.59s -> 3353.47s]  Okay.
[3353.47s -> 3354.35s]  I gotta go around.
[3355.15s -> 3359.28s]  There was a spoon.
[3359.84s -> 3361.04s]  Spoon could be a mallet.
[3364.33s -> 3364.97s]  It's rounded.
[3367.29s -> 3368.17s]  Somebody has a gun.
[3377.90s -> 3379.74s]  I died of being scared.
[3389.87s -> 3390.19s]  Okay.
[3391.36s -> 3391.92s]  Slow down.
[3396.83s -> 3397.95s]  Okay, there's mallet guy.
[3400.84s -> 3401.96s]  There's guy with gun.
[3404.43s -> 3407.95s]  Old lady with spoon is right here.
[3408.67s -> 3442.14s]  I'm pretty certain that I just did the original like AT&T jingle.
[3443.42s -> 3446.38s]  All right, I got you.
[3446.38s -> 3447.10s]  This is what I wanted.
[3449.84s -> 3450.16s]  Get out.
[3450.64s -> 3462.40s]  When's mom is late?
[3462.40s -> 3464.80s]  When mom is late with the chicken tendies.
[3465.52s -> 3474.17s]  Why this?
[3475.13s -> 3479.63s]  I don't even know what that means.
[3480.75s -> 3481.71s]  Why did I read that?
[3481.71s -> 3483.71s]  I don't, because I was trying to figure out,
[3483.71s -> 3486.27s]  I was trying to process in my brain what that meant.
[3490.24s -> 3492.96s]  So I'm reading it out loud to try to figure out what
[3494.40s -> 3496.96s]  that, what that person was trying to say to me.
[3497.68s -> 3500.65s]  Then why do they have to be always talking to me?
[3501.45s -> 3506.91s]  What do you mean no one said that?
[3507.55s -> 3508.35s]  Yes, they did.
[3509.63s -> 3510.35s]  Yes, they did.
[3525.98s -> 3527.34s]  You're going to smash brothers me?
[3527.34s -> 3527.66s]  Really?
[3527.66s -> 3529.34s]  You're going to like quadruple grab me?
[3530.14s -> 3531.52s]  I got gun.
[3532.16s -> 3532.64s]  I'm dead.
[3537.79s -> 3538.03s]  Go.
[3538.75s -> 3542.48s]  Oh, shit.
[3542.48s -> 3542.96s]  Oh, shit.
[3542.96s -> 3543.36s]  Oh, shit.
[3543.36s -> 3543.60s]  Okay.
[3544.48s -> 3545.52s]  Now it's climb.
[3545.52s -> 3546.32s]  Climb, climb.
[3546.96s -> 3549.28s]  Climb the ladder that is right here somewhere.
[3549.92s -> 3554.78s]  I missed it.
[3555.42s -> 3559.82s]  What the fuck is this thing?
[3567.52s -> 3569.42s]  Okay.
[3569.42s -> 3570.30s]  Now don't go up there.
[3570.94s -> 3577.96s]  Well, that was fucking completely pointless.
[3579.24s -> 3591.50s]  Why is he still climbing?
[3592.86s -> 3594.78s]  No, get up.
[3595.50s -> 3605.79s]  Can I go that way?
[3609.29s -> 3610.25s]  I can't climb this.
[3610.25s -> 3610.81s]  No, I can't.
[3610.81s -> 3612.25s]  This is just, this is just what the sniper is.
[3612.25s -> 3612.81s]  There's nothing important.
[3612.81s -> 3613.37s]  There's nothing here.
[3614.01s -> 3614.81s]  This doesn't do anything.
[3615.53s -> 3617.82s]  No, this doesn't do anything.
[3619.61s -> 3620.65s]  This, this is blocked.
[3622.60s -> 3624.12s]  So this, this area is blocked.
[3624.12s -> 3625.64s]  I can't do anything here.
[3626.92s -> 3632.25s]  Unless I can go this way.
[3637.45s -> 3637.93s]  Guess?
[3637.93s -> 3642.44s]  Kind of, but I, this, this door, this door doesn't open.
[3643.96s -> 3645.00s]  Okay.
[3645.00s -> 3645.64s]  It does open.
[3645.64s -> 3647.00s]  You have to press the X button.
[3648.51s -> 3652.35s]  I thought you had to do is the context menu, but you just have to press X.
[3653.95s -> 3669.85s]  I deserve that.
[3670.65s -> 3673.69s]  I thought it was, you had to hit triangle to do, to like, all right.
[3673.69s -> 3677.37s]  So why is it X is used for doors, but triangle is used to do everything else.
[3679.20s -> 3679.44s]  All right.
[3679.44s -> 3682.48s]  We're just doing full on ASMR for the next like 15 minutes.
[3696.62s -> 3697.10s]  Ew.
[3697.98s -> 3698.62s]  Did they hear me?
[3699.42s -> 3702.01s]  All right.
[3702.01s -> 3704.80s]  I'm going to do this, do Trump again.
[3705.28s -> 3707.36s]  You're the only person I think that's ever asked me to do that.
[3708.89s -> 3710.33s]  I know I'm doing this so wrong.
[3710.89s -> 3713.05s]  I know that I'm supposed to be sneaking around through here.
[3715.52s -> 3716.48s]  What did, what?
[3716.48s -> 3718.24s]  We held hands and I died.
[3721.26s -> 3722.78s]  She just, she break my wrists.
[3722.78s -> 3723.42s]  I don't understand.
[3729.80s -> 3730.60s]  Reach the road.
[3732.11s -> 3737.39s]  I know I'm supposed to be like pinning, uh, I just walked over here.
[3738.99s -> 3741.39s]  But I know, but I'm supposed to be sneaking around and I, and I get it.
[3741.39s -> 3741.63s]  Right.
[3741.63s -> 3744.51s]  But sneaking to where do I have a map?
[3752.27s -> 3753.39s]  Do I, is this, what is this?
[3758.68s -> 3764.32s]  Next stage, next stage.
[3766.04s -> 3767.72s]  No, this is freaking me out.
[3772.80s -> 3773.60s]  Guide?
[3773.60s -> 3774.80s]  No, mission objective.
[3774.80s -> 3776.24s]  No, I don't have a map or anything.
[3778.49s -> 3781.05s]  Maybe I just, all right.
[3781.05s -> 3783.21s]  Well now I need to see what's over on the left side.
[3783.21s -> 3783.77s]  I'm going to get shot.
[3785.13s -> 3789.82s]  What if I get shot with a gun like twice?
[3790.70s -> 3791.74s]  What a grandmother.
[3792.14s -> 3796.54s]  Bending my wrist kind of hard is enough to kill me.
[3797.66s -> 3798.06s]  Okay.
[3798.06s -> 3802.14s]  This is what I wanted to do instead of going this way.
[3802.14s -> 3811.26s]  I'm going to go through here into the door, close the door and I close it.
[3813.77s -> 3814.09s]  Okay.
[3814.09s -> 3815.69s]  Now I'm going to just hide.
[3816.57s -> 3817.37s]  Can I open this?
[3820.20s -> 3823.10s]  There's a refrigerator.
[3823.10s -> 3824.70s]  The refrigerator is not plugged in.
[3824.70s -> 3825.50s]  Plug it in.
[3826.30s -> 3827.26s]  This does not open.
[3827.26s -> 3831.85s]  It doesn't.
[3831.85s -> 3832.41s]  It does.
[3832.41s -> 3832.65s]  All right.
[3832.65s -> 3833.45s]  What's in here?
[3833.45s -> 3837.88s]  There's a cassette player.
[3837.88s -> 3839.80s]  It looks like there's some power left in the batteries.
[3841.02s -> 3841.82s]  Use it.
[3841.82s -> 3847.90s]  How do I play it?
[3848.70s -> 3849.90s]  4-1-1.
[3850.94s -> 3852.28s]  Oh, 4-1-1.
[3858.51s -> 3864.46s]  It's going to play the tape from the thing.
[3865.58s -> 3867.34s]  Well, I have a code now for something.
[3868.14s -> 3871.53s]  It's a hanging scroll which depicts a scene from a local folktale.
[3872.33s -> 3878.33s]  What's that behind you on cam?
[3878.89s -> 3879.77s]  Fucking an alien.
[3880.33s -> 3882.65s]  And I'm going to be like eaten alive on camera.
[3884.11s -> 3884.43s]  Maybe.
[3885.15s -> 3886.91s]  Okay.
[3886.91s -> 3888.51s]  So I have 0-4-1-1.
[3898.28s -> 3898.60s]  Here.
[3899.16s -> 3900.51s]  I can't get in there.
[3900.51s -> 3903.23s]  So I have this like 0-4-1-1 frequency.
[3904.43s -> 3906.67s]  What do I do with that frequency?
[3907.63s -> 3908.59s]  I have no clue.
[3923.69s -> 3925.55s]  I'm crazy.
[3925.55s -> 3926.75s]  I thought that was a bug.
[3926.75s -> 3931.63s]  I thought this was an insect coming to fucking sting me.
[3934.75s -> 3944.91s]  There's nobody right here, but where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[3947.88s -> 3948.60s]  I'm just going to go out here.
[3956.09s -> 3957.05s]  Oh, please.
[3957.05s -> 3957.85s]  How did you see me?
[3959.21s -> 3959.93s]  How did you see me?
[3962.80s -> 3963.12s]  Oh, wait.
[3963.12s -> 3963.52s]  The code.
[3964.49s -> 3965.29s]  Combination lock.
[3965.85s -> 3966.97s]  Remove lock.
[3966.97s -> 3967.69s]  I know it's 0-4-1-1.
[3967.69s -> 3968.81s]  There's no time for that now.
[3968.81s -> 3969.69s]  Oh, fuck off.
[3970.73s -> 3980.09s]  Shut the door.
[3980.09s -> 3980.97s]  Shut the door.
[3980.97s -> 3981.61s]  Shut the door on him.
[3981.61s -> 3982.25s]  Shut the door.
[3982.25s -> 3982.89s]  Shut the door on him.
[3983.69s -> 4008.62s]  I know it's...
[4008.62s -> 4009.58s]  I know it's comp...
[4009.58s -> 4010.54s]  Oh, man.
[4010.54s -> 4011.26s]  I'm so close.
[4011.90s -> 4013.34s]  But so far at the same time.
[4015.34s -> 4016.62s]  There's no time for that now.
[4017.82s -> 4018.78s]  Select is the map?
[4024.68s -> 4025.48s]  Why?
[4025.48s -> 4030.33s]  Okay.
[4034.41s -> 4038.92s]  So I have to go down here.
[4039.48s -> 4044.30s]  So we go around to the right, bang a left, and then go.
[4045.10s -> 4046.92s]  I'm just running for it.
[4048.12s -> 4050.03s]  Does it keep me?
[4052.48s -> 4058.24s]  So go around, straight take, bang a left, and then go around the whole thing.
[4058.96s -> 4065.29s]  Bang a left.
[4066.01s -> 4067.13s]  Oh, that guy has the gun.
[4068.01s -> 4068.25s]  Right.
[4069.15s -> 4069.95s]  Okay.
[4069.95s -> 4071.79s]  All right.
[4071.79s -> 4073.07s]  I got to do this the right way.
[4073.07s -> 4073.87s]  I can do this the right way.
[4073.87s -> 4074.99s]  I've got to go around and...
[4074.99s -> 4075.63s]  All right.
[4076.19s -> 4077.23s]  You're a very good shot.
[4080.75s -> 4082.19s]  You don't bang a literal left.
[4082.19s -> 4085.15s]  You bang a metaphorical left.
[4087.52s -> 4090.00s]  I have to go around and just sneak around.
[4090.00s -> 4090.72s]  Okay, sneak.
[4091.28s -> 4097.29s]  Fuck.
[4097.29s -> 4098.01s]  No, fuck it.
[4098.01s -> 4098.41s]  Just go.
[4100.72s -> 4103.68s]  That's the only time that I know that I'm able to actually do...
[4103.68s -> 4105.60s]  I just got shot in the fucking head.
[4106.99s -> 4107.79s]  Oh, come on.
[4107.79s -> 4108.11s]  I just...
[4109.63s -> 4110.91s]  I don't want to sneak.
[4110.91s -> 4111.87s]  Oh, I don't like...
[4111.87s -> 4116.35s]  I don't want to fucking crouch around and like Metal Gear Solid, like five enemies.
[4118.11s -> 4118.61s]  Okay.
[4119.74s -> 4121.34s]  Because you sneak so slow.
[4121.90s -> 4124.06s]  You go like you're in slow motion.
[4124.86s -> 4126.28s]  Like, look.
[4126.84s -> 4128.70s]  That's how fast I have to go.
[4134.76s -> 4174.67s]  Four people playing a stealth game and they refuse to sneak.
[4174.67s -> 4175.87s]  I didn't know this was a stealth game.
[4175.87s -> 4177.07s]  I thought this was a horror game.
[4178.43s -> 4180.35s]  I don't want to sneak around the scares.
[4180.35s -> 4181.23s]  I want them to scare me.
[4182.11s -> 4195.20s]  You put in turbo.
[4195.20s -> 4195.68s]  Ejected.
[4195.68s -> 4197.12s]  You put in splinter cell.
[4212.59s -> 4212.99s]  Bang.
[4213.55s -> 4214.99s]  Now that would redeem it.
[4215.07s -> 4216.11s]  That would redeem it.
[4216.11s -> 4229.47s]  I move so slow.
[4230.67s -> 4236.65s]  Is there a streamed splinter cell game?
[4236.65s -> 4237.93s]  Is the first three amazing?
[4237.93s -> 4238.25s]  No.
[4238.25s -> 4239.05s]  Put them on the list.
[4239.05s -> 4239.53s]  Let's do it.
[4249.63s -> 4255.40s]  Is it a good game?
[4255.40s -> 4255.88s]  Is it fun?
[4257.29s -> 4257.69s]  It's good.
[4259.26s -> 4259.98s]  It is a good game.
[4259.98s -> 4260.30s]  I'm not...
[4260.30s -> 4261.02s]  I'm telling you.
[4261.02s -> 4261.98s]  It's actually pretty fun.
[4267.26s -> 4267.82s]  It is.
[4267.82s -> 4268.78s]  I don't...
[4268.78s -> 4270.06s]  It's interesting mechanics.
[4270.06s -> 4270.94s]  Really interesting mechanic.
[4270.94s -> 4271.82s]  I'm serious.
[4271.82s -> 4272.70s]  I'm not just saying this.
[4273.66s -> 4274.65s]  I'm not just saying.
[4274.65s -> 4275.77s]  It's a very interesting game.
[4276.89s -> 4278.01s]  Try this one more time.
[4278.01s -> 4279.37s]  The fuck face stat.
[4281.07s -> 4284.78s]  Okay.
[4284.78s -> 4285.90s]  He has auto lock on.
[4286.62s -> 4286.86s]  No.
[4286.86s -> 4287.82s]  I'm going to try to get through.
[4288.38s -> 4294.25s]  Is the German runner good games?
[4294.25s -> 4296.49s]  We played two great games before this.
[4297.29s -> 4297.77s]  No.
[4297.77s -> 4298.01s]  Shit.
[4298.01s -> 4299.29s]  That means I'm saying it's not good.
[4300.09s -> 4304.57s]  Whatever.
[4304.57s -> 4312.01s]  Report that guy for aimbotting.
[4312.65s -> 4313.77s]  I'm just going to go straight.
[4313.77s -> 4314.73s]  Even if he shoots me once.
[4315.69s -> 4317.05s]  Just go.
[4317.05s -> 4317.37s]  Okay.
[4317.37s -> 4318.25s]  I'm good.
[4318.25s -> 4318.81s]  This is my chance.
[4318.81s -> 4319.21s]  My chance.
[4319.21s -> 4319.69s]  My chance.
[4319.69s -> 4319.93s]  Okay.
[4319.93s -> 4320.81s]  I got to go left.
[4321.61s -> 4330.00s]  Okay.
[4330.00s -> 4331.52s]  Can I go...
[4332.56s -> 4333.76s]  So I am going left.
[4334.80s -> 4335.84s]  This is me going left.
[4335.84s -> 4336.24s]  Isn't it?
[4337.12s -> 4339.08s]  How am I still...
[4339.08s -> 4340.12s]  Why does it still say I'm over there?
[4340.84s -> 4344.64s]  Because I ain't got nowhere to go.
[4345.36s -> 4348.72s]  None of these...
[4348.72s -> 4349.52s]  Is this open?
[4349.52s -> 4350.56s]  Can I like get in this?
[4350.56s -> 4351.60s]  Can I do anything here?
[4352.56s -> 4353.92s]  This is all blocked up.
[4353.92s -> 4354.72s]  Nothing up there.
[4354.72s -> 4355.44s]  I can't...
[4355.44s -> 4356.48s]  I guess I could try to...
[4356.48s -> 4357.20s]  Don't do it.
[4358.48s -> 4358.96s]  I can...
[4358.96s -> 4359.52s]  Really?
[4359.52s -> 4360.40s]  I can climb this shit?
[4361.28s -> 4362.35s]  Oh.
[4362.35s -> 4362.99s]  Give me a break.
[4362.99s -> 4363.55s]  I just found it.
[4364.19s -> 4366.28s]  I just found it.
[4367.32s -> 4370.54s]  He's coming up.
[4370.54s -> 4371.02s]  He's coming up.
[4371.02s -> 4373.18s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, hurry.
[4374.14s -> 4375.23s]  I just...
[4375.23s -> 4375.79s]  I just did it.
[4376.51s -> 4391.07s]  Finish the game.
[4393.15s -> 4393.39s]  All right.
[4393.39s -> 4394.51s]  I'll finish the tutorial.
[4397.61s -> 4399.29s]  That was too realistic for me.
[4399.29s -> 4400.17s]  Because that was...
[4400.17s -> 4402.57s]  That was like a dog is actually in your room like dying.
[4403.93s -> 4404.57s]  Are you okay?
[4405.21s -> 4405.85s]  Hey.
[4405.85s -> 4406.97s]  This place is messed up.
[4408.08s -> 4409.52s]  Let's just go to the church together.
[4410.08s -> 4411.44s]  And then think about what to do.
[4412.32s -> 4413.76s]  The dog's already dead anyway.
[4418.75s -> 4420.51s]  I'm sorry, but we have to.
[4423.12s -> 4423.68s]  What happened?
[4424.40s -> 4432.76s]  Am I going to play Blair Witch?
[4433.24s -> 4434.44s]  No, I heard it wasn't very good.
[4435.48s -> 4436.92s]  I heard it was actually pretty bad.
[4437.72s -> 4438.60s]  Is that true?
[4438.60s -> 4439.32s]  As I heard?
[4444.70s -> 4445.10s]  That's the...
[4445.10s -> 4447.66s]  Okay, so like new horror games?
[4447.66s -> 4450.30s]  The last like two or three new horror games that have come out
[4450.30s -> 4451.58s]  I've heard have been actually pretty bad.
[4461.39s -> 4462.51s]  Will you play bad games?
[4462.51s -> 4465.47s]  No, well, not like bad as in like the game's just not good.
[4466.81s -> 4468.25s]  It's not like there's nothing there.
[4468.25s -> 4468.75s]  Are you okay?
[4469.69s -> 4471.61s]  Can't you walk a bit more slowly?
[4471.61s -> 4472.49s]  I'm losing you.
[4474.54s -> 4475.10s]  What do you mean?
[4477.52s -> 4478.72s]  This game is not good.
[4483.07s -> 4485.53s]  I'm getting close to turning it off.
[4486.17s -> 4488.81s]  As you've just heard about two minutes ago.
[4489.93s -> 4491.13s]  You still have more to do.
[4491.69s -> 4494.20s]  You know that we can't proceed without you.
[4499.45s -> 4501.77s]  Won't be long before someone takes a trip to the other side.
[4503.85s -> 4506.73s]  It looks like you've been taking good care of my sister.
[4506.73s -> 4509.61s]  Oh, sick, sick watch.
[4509.61s -> 4510.11s]  Watch.
[4512.14s -> 4512.64s]  Hey.
[4513.10s -> 4513.60s]  Let's go.
[4514.54s -> 4515.04s]  What?
[4521.29s -> 4522.01s]  What happened?
[4529.00s -> 4531.88s]  All right, we're reaching a lot of roads, okay?
[4532.76s -> 4534.94s]  That's my complaint so far with the game.
[4534.94s -> 4536.30s]  First four missions of the game.
[4536.30s -> 4537.10s]  Reach the road.
[4537.66s -> 4538.86s]  Why can't it be find the...
[4539.82s -> 4540.70s]  Find the box.
[4542.19s -> 4543.15s]  Climb the tree.
[4543.15s -> 4543.95s]  Reach the road.
[4548.73s -> 4550.73s]  Find an object that'll act as a weapon.
[4550.73s -> 4552.25s]  I can do that.
[4552.81s -> 4554.46s]  Are you coming?
[4554.46s -> 4559.96s]  Are you coming?
[4559.96s -> 4562.43s]  Let's go.
[4562.43s -> 4566.12s]  I need to find something that'll be a weapon.
[4567.00s -> 4567.56s]  What we got?
[4567.56s -> 4568.12s]  The map.
[4568.12s -> 4569.48s]  All right, cool.
[4569.48s -> 4570.60s]  I don't know.
[4570.60s -> 4573.72s]  This map is just looks like an organ.
[4575.04s -> 4576.16s]  Not the piano type.
[4576.16s -> 4576.80s]  Are people gonna go?
[4579.23s -> 4580.99s]  No, like a kidney.
[4581.95s -> 4593.71s]  She keeps bending her neck backwards and looking at me.
[4594.43s -> 4603.42s]  She's just got...
[4603.42s -> 4603.82s]  She's got...
[4603.82s -> 4605.10s]  Look at that nerd neck.
[4606.38s -> 4609.53s]  Where are you?
[4609.53s -> 4619.66s]  We are right over this way.
[4620.86s -> 4628.30s]  All right, is it two?
[4628.30s -> 4634.28s]  It's two.
[4635.56s -> 4637.79s]  So you're right here.
[4644.75s -> 4646.59s]  What is wrong with some people?
[4646.59s -> 4647.15s]  What is...
[4647.15s -> 4648.43s]  What is wrong with you?
[4649.07s -> 4650.19s]  What is wrong with you?
[4651.72s -> 4652.68s]  What is wrong?
[4652.68s -> 4654.04s]  What is wrong with you?
[4655.08s -> 4655.32s]  Yeah.
[4655.96s -> 4663.47s]  All right, I need a weapon.
[4664.03s -> 4668.27s]  Weapon.
[4668.27s -> 4673.37s]  A poker has been thrust into the veins of the bonfire.
[4673.37s -> 4674.57s]  Looks like it would make a good weapon.
[4679.20s -> 4680.00s]  Got it.
[4680.00s -> 4688.99s]  Okay, you can do that.
[4688.99s -> 4689.55s]  You can...
[4691.05s -> 4691.29s]  Yeah.
[4694.17s -> 4694.73s]  I'm sorry.
[4695.37s -> 4698.01s]  I need to dislocate your left shoulder.
[4700.16s -> 4700.48s]  Yeah.
[4701.98s -> 4702.22s]  Whoa.
[4702.94s -> 4709.08s]  Oh, I'm making you climb now too?
[4709.64s -> 4710.60s]  I'm awful.
[4710.60s -> 4711.16s]  I'm sorry.
[4712.22s -> 4716.62s]  All right, so we got to go through the iron warehouse.
[4716.62s -> 4717.42s]  What the hell it said.
[4718.06s -> 4720.35s]  Well, yeah, she wasn't the thing.
[4720.35s -> 4720.83s]  That's good.
[4723.23s -> 4729.21s]  Open lock?
[4729.21s -> 4731.76s]  The lock is old and the keyhole is rusted open.
[4731.76s -> 4733.12s]  Probably impossible to open with a key.
[4733.12s -> 4734.16s]  Oh, well then.
[4734.16s -> 4734.56s]  Look at me.
[4738.33s -> 4742.51s]  Look at me.
[4754.51s -> 4754.75s]  What?
[4754.75s -> 4755.07s]  What?
[4755.07s -> 4755.55s]  What?
[4755.55s -> 4756.67s]  What?
[4756.67s -> 4757.07s]  Who is it?
[4757.07s -> 4763.55s]  Oh, that guy's huge.
[4764.19s -> 4767.77s]  Where did...
[4767.77s -> 4768.25s]  Where is she?
[4769.93s -> 4770.49s]  Where is she?
[4772.92s -> 4774.04s]  Where did she go?
[4774.04s -> 4785.20s]  Where's my friend?
[4788.62s -> 4791.56s]  It's Bushido Blade.
[4792.68s -> 4794.04s]  See?
[4794.04s -> 4794.92s]  One hit, two hits.
[4795.56s -> 4800.33s]  Did she just say look at me?
[4803.08s -> 4803.72s]  Yeah.
[4803.72s -> 4806.48s]  I think she did.
[4807.12s -> 4810.27s]  But where are you?
[4811.07s -> 4818.70s]  I don't know where she is.
[4825.23s -> 4826.43s]  Yes, because she lost you.
[4832.08s -> 4833.68s]  Well, just yell back to me.
[4834.56s -> 4837.16s]  How hard is it for you to yell back?
[4840.67s -> 4841.63s]  Now I have to find you.
[4853.21s -> 4853.69s]  Found you.
[4854.25s -> 4854.65s]  Come here.
[4855.29s -> 4863.52s]  Get over here.
[4871.53s -> 4881.39s]  Try...
[4881.39s -> 4882.43s]  I was thinking of saying...
[4883.31s -> 4887.31s]  Oh no, she's shoving vegetables down my throat like a grandma.
[4887.31s -> 4888.83s]  That's how the grandma kills you.
[4890.56s -> 4891.60s]  But then I got hit twice.
[4892.48s -> 4894.78s]  I didn't want to do this again.
[4895.42s -> 4898.91s]  And it was...
[4898.91s -> 4899.47s]  I know.
[4899.47s -> 4901.31s]  That's why I didn't do it and I buried it.
[4902.19s -> 4904.25s]  All right, last try.
[4904.25s -> 4905.05s]  Last try and then...
[4906.64s -> 4907.20s]  What time is it?
[4907.20s -> 4908.00s]  It's been four hours.
[4909.44s -> 4910.32s]  I'll hang out for a while.
[4912.72s -> 4913.36s]  Turn on a light.
[4913.36s -> 4914.72s]  Your face game is getting too dark.
[4914.72s -> 4916.16s]  Everyone just totally turn it off.
[4926.52s -> 4927.24s]  Follow me.
[4930.84s -> 4931.40s]  Come here.
[4933.69s -> 4934.25s]  Get over here.
[4935.72s -> 4936.44s]  What the fuck is she?
[4943.87s -> 4946.67s]  Do I really need to like jack into your brain to see where you went?
[4960.01s -> 4960.81s]  Who the hell is that?
[4969.80s -> 4971.55s]  Okay, you made it.
[4984.54s -> 4985.34s]  All right.
[4985.34s -> 4986.30s]  Give me the poker.
[4987.26s -> 4988.89s]  Do you need help getting up that?
[4989.85s -> 4996.09s]  We're good.
[4996.09s -> 5006.19s]  Let's go.
[5006.19s -> 5007.98s]  Get past the iron gate.
[5008.94s -> 5009.90s]  Still follow me.
[5010.46s -> 5011.58s]  Make sure you're still behind me.
[5014.48s -> 5019.21s]  The iron gate is up here.
[5019.21s -> 5020.17s]  Follow me still.
[5021.93s -> 5032.86s]  Come on.
[5032.86s -> 5038.04s]  I don't even know if this is the right way to the iron gate.
[5038.60s -> 5039.08s]  It might not.
[5039.08s -> 5039.48s]  There it is.
[5040.44s -> 5042.54s]  Iron gate.
[5043.18s -> 5053.37s]  Where'd you go?
[5059.82s -> 5062.22s]  Oh no, you turned away.
[5062.22s -> 5063.26s]  She's infected now.
[5067.24s -> 5069.80s]  Imagine hitting this two or three times and not figuring this out.
[5069.80s -> 5070.76s]  You have to hit it three times.
[5074.81s -> 5076.01s]  Now she should be right next to me.
[5077.24s -> 5086.92s]  Head towards the settlement so that they like to go up there.
[5088.01s -> 5090.30s]  Okay, let's move.
[5090.86s -> 5092.84s]  You're with me, right?
[5093.40s -> 5106.25s]  Oh, by the way, a lot of people were saying to play Soma.
[5107.21s -> 5110.17s]  I don't think that has to even be a Halloween like stream.
[5110.73s -> 5112.33s]  I think I could just play that for fun.
[5114.32s -> 5117.04s]  That doesn't have to be like, oh no, it's the 31st.
[5117.68s -> 5118.96s]  All horror games turn off.
[5119.52s -> 5120.91s]  No, we can do that.
[5120.91s -> 5129.63s]  Come here.
[5129.63s -> 5132.48s]  It's not that scary.
[5132.48s -> 5133.44s]  I'll show you.
[5133.44s -> 5134.40s]  Look, I'll prove it.
[5135.28s -> 5137.79s]  Don't run down here.
[5139.95s -> 5140.27s]  Watch.
[5141.50s -> 5142.06s]  Pay attention.
[5149.12s -> 5150.00s]  Look how scared he is.
[5152.89s -> 5154.49s]  I've heard so much about this guy.
[5154.49s -> 5155.37s]  He's so strong.
[5155.37s -> 5156.57s]  He's really, really powerful.
[5157.37s -> 5159.53s]  That's right, motherfucker.
[5159.53s -> 5175.82s]  Get up here.
[5175.82s -> 5176.06s]  See?
[5176.62s -> 5178.20s]  Now pick that up.
[5178.20s -> 5179.48s]  Pick up his entire iron.
[5190.30s -> 5192.52s]  Hey, what's going on?
[5193.08s -> 5194.89s]  Why wouldn't...
[5198.67s -> 5199.15s]  That was weird.
[5199.95s -> 5209.50s]  All right, come over here.
[5210.46s -> 5210.86s]  Right there.
[5210.86s -> 5211.18s]  All right.
[5211.90s -> 5214.94s]  All right, stay with me.
[5215.82s -> 5217.95s]  I missed.
[5221.80s -> 5233.48s]  Two, three, up.
[5244.27s -> 5244.91s]  Wait.
[5244.91s -> 5248.97s]  Hold on.
[5248.97s -> 5252.03s]  She's blind?
[5263.88s -> 5273.37s]  Oh, as I'm listening?
[5274.92s -> 5278.36s]  No, people were like talking about my Lego hair for like 30 minutes.
[5293.44s -> 5293.92s]  Siren.
[5295.05s -> 5295.45s]  Singing.
[5319.44s -> 5320.32s]  River of blood.
[5321.04s -> 5326.99s]  Are you with me here?
[5329.31s -> 5333.87s]  So that means when I swung this and hit her in the face,
[5334.51s -> 5336.36s]  I just didn't know I was...
[5337.32s -> 5340.28s]  It appears to be the back end of the church, but there's a sturdy lock on it.
[5340.28s -> 5341.56s]  Well, where is this sturdy lock?
[5342.12s -> 5342.68s]  Knock it off.
[5343.96s -> 5344.52s]  That's horrible.
[5346.84s -> 5351.44s]  What do you mean you didn't know?
[5351.44s -> 5352.08s]  No, like...
[5359.79s -> 5360.59s]  You know what I'm saying.
[5361.39s -> 5371.63s]  All right, I think there's a sniper over there.
[5371.63s -> 5376.12s]  A sniper right in front of us.
[5385.45s -> 5390.25s]  I do appreciate every major blood-borne boss in the background.
[5396.38s -> 5402.20s]  It's like such a tiny room.
[5402.20s -> 5402.70s]  Come on.
[5411.32s -> 5412.92s]  Stalling because game sucks.
[5414.49s -> 5415.69s]  No, that's not...
[5415.69s -> 5416.73s]  I'm not.
[5416.73s -> 5419.13s]  I'm just trying to see where people are.
[5420.17s -> 5426.93s]  It's okay.
[5449.47s -> 5449.97s]  Okay.
[5450.35s -> 5451.66s]  I gotta go this way.
[5456.27s -> 5457.07s]  Where's that sniper?
[5458.19s -> 5461.39s]  Not looking this way, but I'm gonna see.
[5461.39s -> 5461.89s]  Turn around.
[5462.51s -> 5467.15s]  This way.
[5467.85s -> 5473.56s]  Doesn't look like it.
[5474.36s -> 5478.19s]  Are you still there?
[5478.83s -> 5483.09s]  Did it.
[5486.86s -> 5487.36s]  Good.
[5492.62s -> 5493.66s]  Yes, I wish to save.
[5494.38s -> 5513.92s]  This is more important to me.
[5514.40s -> 5515.44s]  Than the game at the moment.
[5516.00s -> 5518.14s]  Just give me one second.
[5518.14s -> 5519.02s]  So I can listen, too.
[5559.44s -> 5561.92s]  He seems to be making a lot of fuss about a suitcase.
[5568.65s -> 5569.15s]  Okay.
[5570.88s -> 5573.92s]  Just to everyone who knew what I was talking about.
[5583.07s -> 5584.03s]  Another character.
[5585.55s -> 5586.91s]  Reach the road.
[5592.49s -> 5593.13s]  Wait, do I have a...
[5594.22s -> 5594.86s]  Oh, shit.
[5594.86s -> 5596.54s]  I have like a zoomable shotgun.
[5606.73s -> 5607.37s]  Play the blob...
[5612.89s -> 5620.99s]  I can't even hear what it's doing because I'm not plugged in.
[5622.75s -> 5623.95s]  I don't know what it's doing.
[5624.83s -> 5626.27s]  There's two of them on screen.
[5626.27s -> 5626.83s]  I can't hear it.
[5626.83s -> 5628.83s]  I can only hear the game because my headphones are plugged into the game.
[5628.83s -> 5633.07s]  With the scramble for trolleys, the automatic doors, and the moving walkway.
[5633.07s -> 5635.45s]  No wonder we all like traffic.
[5645.50s -> 5646.00s]  Where?
[5662.57s -> 5663.07s]  Shoot!
[5673.87s -> 5674.43s]  All right.
[5674.43s -> 5675.15s]  I don't...
[5675.15s -> 5676.27s]  I'm done with Mr. Blobby.
[5680.12s -> 5681.16s]  Blame the mouse?
[5681.16s -> 5681.96s]  Blame the mouse?
[5681.96s -> 5683.00s]  There is no mice.
[5683.64s -> 5688.20s]  Just a generic, not official PlayStation 2 controller.
[5689.16s -> 5691.72s]  For a second, I had like a mini heart attack.
[5692.36s -> 5694.06s]  Because you know, like...
[5694.78s -> 5696.57s]  Did you guys' parents...
[5696.57s -> 5701.85s]  Did your mother ever put a sticker here that had your name and address on it?
[5704.94s -> 5706.78s]  Like, this is who this belongs to!
[5708.64s -> 5708.96s]  No?
[5708.96s -> 5710.16s]  Oh, that's right.
[5710.16s -> 5710.96s]  I forgot.
[5710.96s -> 5712.24s]  I forgot how old I was.
[5718.40s -> 5720.48s]  This is like 25 years ago.
[5721.04s -> 5723.05s]  This is before the invention of the cell phone.
[5723.69s -> 5726.60s]  Am I...
[5726.60s -> 5727.48s]  All right, I'm gonna do this again.
[5728.04s -> 5736.97s]  My mom put that sticker on me.
[5744.35s -> 5748.24s]  Look at the snipers.
[5748.24s -> 5749.60s]  Sniper on the train tracks.
[5750.96s -> 5758.68s]  Is there only one sniper?
[5759.64s -> 5763.47s]  There's one sniper that's...
[5764.75s -> 5767.34s]  But you're not even, like, in the game.
[5775.20s -> 5776.35s]  Wait.
[5776.35s -> 5777.31s]  They're gonna be right down here.
[5781.88s -> 5783.96s]  How the hell am I gonna control this with the analog?
[5785.08s -> 5799.28s]  Oh, shit.
[5799.28s -> 5799.78s]  Who's that?
[5801.92s -> 5804.96s]  Is that me?
[5805.50s -> 5807.88s]  Who's shooting the gun up here?
[5813.26s -> 5813.98s]  What?
[5813.98s -> 5834.99s]  Okay, so they don't...
[5836.03s -> 5839.55s]  All right, so they don't come into frame.
[5839.63s -> 5842.27s]  You can't do the static thing.
[5842.27s -> 5844.51s]  Unless they're within, like, a certain range, I guess.
[5845.87s -> 5849.82s]  I know what that guy is, but how am I gonna out-snipe that person?
[5850.62s -> 5857.34s]  Maybe sneak?
[5858.30s -> 5860.52s]  This game's making me nauseous.
[5861.72s -> 5862.22s]  Yeah.
[5864.94s -> 5865.44s]  Yeah.
[5867.39s -> 5868.03s]  Fuck.
[5868.03s -> 5872.17s]  Did I already shoot him?
[5878.28s -> 5878.78s]  Yeah.
[5880.83s -> 5881.33s]  Crap.
[5882.09s -> 5882.59s]  You're right.
[5894.14s -> 5896.54s]  Hey, what am I, what am I, what am I blubbing up to?
[5896.54s -> 5897.04s]  Oh.
[5900.94s -> 5903.26s]  Yes, those moving walkways are certain...
[5906.52s -> 5908.44s]  Okay, this, I don't...
[5908.44s -> 5910.33s]  I'm just gonna crouch?
[5915.92s -> 5917.40s]  It's the guy who's...
[5917.40s -> 5918.68s]  It's this person right here, right?
[5919.96s -> 5930.99s]  I can't see that.
[5930.99s -> 5932.19s]  I guess I can.
[5933.47s -> 5934.27s]  Oh, come on.
[5934.27s -> 5936.11s]  This is gonna be fucking impossible.
[5950.72s -> 5951.22s]  Uh...
[5952.24s -> 5953.28s]  I can't, I can't see him.
[5953.28s -> 5954.40s]  I have to have to sneak around.
[5954.40s -> 5954.90s]  Come on.
[5958.56s -> 5960.08s]  We demand Mr. Blobby.
[5960.80s -> 5968.12s]  I just exed out of the Blobby window.
[5968.12s -> 5969.72s]  I'm mad at this game.
[5970.44s -> 5975.76s]  He still refuses to sneak.
[6003.02s -> 6004.06s]  Just roll.
[6004.06s -> 6005.82s]  Just lie in there, just roll.
[6005.82s -> 6007.34s]  Just do, just forward roll.
[6008.22s -> 6011.90s]  I've been seen.
[6013.42s -> 6019.68s]  Go the other way?
[6021.82s -> 6023.82s]  Or just run by and duck?
[6024.54s -> 6030.16s]  There's no way you've heard me walking from all the way back here.
[6037.88s -> 6049.16s]  Wait, so...
[6049.16s -> 6050.84s]  What? How am I supposed to go?
[6052.20s -> 6053.56s]  Is the building over here on the left?
[6054.52s -> 6057.12s]  Yes?
[6058.06s -> 6061.76s]  This guy's stream sniping.
[6061.76s -> 6062.26s]  Could be.
[6063.04s -> 6086.20s]  There's somebody in this...
[6086.20s -> 6087.24s]  There's somebody here though.
[6087.24s -> 6088.04s]  Where's this other person?
[6088.04s -> 6088.84s]  They're like right in here.
[6089.72s -> 6092.03s]  I have to go around.
[6092.03s -> 6092.75s]  Yeah, I can't...
[6092.75s -> 6093.47s]  I gotta go around.
[6094.35s -> 6097.28s]  But there's somebody in here.
[6099.44s -> 6106.75s]  What was that image?
[6110.75s -> 6111.63s]  Oh my god!
[6111.79s -> 6112.43s]  Stop!
[6112.43s -> 6114.73s]  Get away from my heart!
[6115.69s -> 6116.25s]  Damn it.
[6125.63s -> 6126.43s]  Well, I know where to go.
[6126.43s -> 6132.38s]  I'm gonna try to...
[6132.38s -> 6133.42s]  Oh, shit.
[6133.42s -> 6141.52s]  Just don't be bad.
[6142.32s -> 6145.28s]  Just don't be bad.
[6145.28s -> 6152.94s]  The, the, the, the two or three words that you say to a streamer and I'll look over and they'll go,
[6152.94s -> 6153.74s]  Shut up!
[6159.15s -> 6159.95s]  Shut up, idiot!
[6159.95s -> 6161.95s]  No, I'm, I'm doing fine!
[6162.75s -> 6165.15s]  It's this game, the game controls are all fucked up.
[6165.79s -> 6166.35s]  It's the game...
[6166.35s -> 6168.56s]  Ah!
[6168.56s -> 6169.04s]  It's the game...
[6169.04s -> 6169.54s]  Ah!
[6170.61s -> 6171.49s]  No, I'm all upset!
[6173.87s -> 6174.83s]  Somebody is right here.
[6175.39s -> 6176.90s]  I'm just gonna aim the gun.
[6177.54s -> 6186.14s]  It zoomed in too far.
[6186.14s -> 6187.02s]  How do I pull it out?
[6187.74s -> 6193.54s]  Wait, were they...
[6193.54s -> 6194.74s]  They were over here last time.
[6201.87s -> 6202.91s]  All right, I'm...
[6202.91s -> 6203.79s]  I'm afraid...
[6203.79s -> 6204.43s]  There you are.
[6204.43s -> 6204.99s]  Nope.
[6204.99s -> 6206.19s]  Was that just anti-aliasing?
[6206.99s -> 6208.93s]  No, that was just...
[6208.93s -> 6211.09s]  That was just actual like bad aliasing.
[6212.13s -> 6216.74s]  Where is this person?
[6217.54s -> 6225.70s]  Not you.
[6228.83s -> 6231.75s]  Not you.
[6232.93s -> 6241.58s]  Where are they?
[6241.58s -> 6256.88s]  Maybe it's, maybe it's up here.
[6257.84s -> 6263.01s]  Oh, shoot the lock.
[6290.54s -> 6291.18s]  What?
[6291.18s -> 6300.27s]  Why would I be standing this close?
[6300.91s -> 6301.55s]  Shoot the chain.
[6304.22s -> 6304.86s]  Oh no.
[6314.78s -> 6317.02s]  I think your character is smashed.
[6331.52s -> 6332.88s]  Okay, I'm done.
[6332.88s -> 6334.32s]  I'm done playing this one.
[6335.12s -> 6336.08s]  This is fun.
[6336.08s -> 6338.32s]  It was real, actually pretty fun.
[6338.32s -> 6340.16s]  But after that, I'm...
[6340.16s -> 6342.24s]  I mean, I have to stop.
[6342.24s -> 6342.74s]  I'm done.
[6347.01s -> 6349.25s]  Oh no, what will I do?
[6350.29s -> 6352.53s]  Who's shooting a gun?
[6354.98s -> 6355.48s]  What?
[6356.58s -> 6359.17s]  No, please, please.
[6359.17s -> 6359.67s]  Oh no.
[6360.53s -> 6361.81s]  The fucking neck grab.
[6364.53s -> 6365.82s]  God damn it.
[6365.82s -> 6366.32s]  Fuck.
[6389.04s -> 6390.80s]  This old man joke.
[6390.80s -> 6393.28s]  This old man joke gets shot.
[6393.28s -> 6396.64s]  Wait, this old man joke gets shot joke isn't funny.
[6397.52s -> 6429.36s]  I got him.
[6429.90s -> 6431.16s]  I killed him.
[6432.10s -> 6437.90s]  I killed the motherfucker.
[6437.90s -> 6438.40s]  He's dead.
[6452.29s -> 6452.93s]  Holy shit.
[6453.49s -> 6456.26s]  Oh, they're coming though.
[6479.57s -> 6480.53s]  No, run, run, run.
[6481.17s -> 6481.73s]  Please run.
[6483.01s -> 6484.13s]  Just jump off the edge.
[6484.13s -> 6485.25s]  Please, for the love of God.
[6485.25s -> 6485.89s]  I did. I win.
[6485.89s -> 6486.77s]  I won. I beat the game.
[6487.49s -> 6488.74s]  I beat the game.
[6488.74s -> 6489.46s]  I killed the boss.
[6496.45s -> 6496.95s]  I won.
[6497.49s -> 6499.25s]  That was the boss of the level.
[6499.25s -> 6499.75s]  I win.
[6502.85s -> 6503.97s]  Found the reload button.
[6504.61s -> 6505.11s]  Pog.
[6506.29s -> 6511.70s]  Don't ever play this again.
[6511.70s -> 6512.58s]  The game's not bad.
[6516.59s -> 6517.63s]  The game's not bad.
[6517.63s -> 6518.35s]  It's hot.
[6519.07s -> 6522.32s]  I think there's like five of these.
[6523.68s -> 6525.63s]  Are we going to see the credits today?
[6543.87s -> 6545.39s]  You could try the PS3 one.
[6548.16s -> 6548.88s]  It was cool.
[6548.88s -> 6550.08s]  That was a cool effect.
[6550.08s -> 6550.96s]  It was a cool thing.
[6551.76s -> 6554.08s]  So what am I doing now?
[6555.34s -> 6556.46s]  That's a really good question.
[6556.46s -> 6558.06s]  I don't really have time to start very much else.
[6559.50s -> 6560.94s]  We're doing jackbox tomorrow.
[6561.82s -> 6563.74s]  So I might just put in...
[6564.86s -> 6570.56s]  No, it's not into the screen.
[6571.36s -> 6576.22s]  Um, I gotta turn the lights on.
[6577.18s -> 6579.38s]  I'm gonna connect.
[6579.38s -> 6580.58s]  No, no way.
[6580.58s -> 6581.14s]  It's not...
[6581.14s -> 6582.10s]  I can't get that set up.
[6583.54s -> 6597.73s]  No, uh, no, no Dead Rising.
[6597.73s -> 6599.41s]  I have to, I have to like download the game.
[6600.45s -> 6602.05s]  And I don't want to start something like that.
[6602.05s -> 6605.41s]  I want to, I want to sit down and play Dead Rising for like seven to eight hours.
[6605.41s -> 6605.91s]  It's great.
[6608.29s -> 6608.79s]  All right.
[6609.25s -> 6610.05s]  I'm taking that out.
[6611.09s -> 6612.58s]  Uh, you know what I'm gonna do?
[6614.05s -> 6614.61s]  I kind of...
[6614.61s -> 6615.65s]  Like, this is gonna sound crazy.
[6616.21s -> 6622.50s]  But I kind of want to like play, um, I'm Jeremy Lamy again for like a little bit.
[6623.55s -> 6624.19s]  I don't know why.
[6625.07s -> 6627.31s]  This is why I want to let this one song I want to play.
[6629.82s -> 6631.90s]  I want to like play the plane song again.
[6633.18s -> 6636.06s]  I was hearing that in the shower the last like few days.
[6636.06s -> 6643.60s]  That like, I was like, I kind of want to do that right now.
[6644.40s -> 6648.42s]  Plus PlayStation 2 and the...
[6648.42s -> 6649.62s]  All this shit is hooked up right now.
[6650.26s -> 6653.36s]  I might as well just do it because I'm never gonna play it again.
[6654.08s -> 6657.31s]  Oh, sorry.
[6657.31s -> 6658.99s]  I just did that to you.
[6658.99s -> 6664.14s]  Where is, where is Jeremy Lamy?
