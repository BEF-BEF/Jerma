[1.53s -> 7.62s]  I'm enjoying rap. Yeah, I didn't have time to make a title, guys. I just found out eight
[7.62s -> 18.21s]  minutes ago that I can't play Tony Hawk right now. That is a quick, very fast title. I just
[18.21s -> 31.07s]  found out I can't play Tony Hawk until I get an original Xbox hard drive. Imagine my face
[31.07s -> 40.63s]  when it's 1.47 p.m. Oh, sorry, 12.47 p.m. Pacific. And I put in Tony Hawk's Underground. Oh,
[40.63s -> 50.15s]  it's backwards. It's backwards compatible. Close. Here it comes. You need an Xbox, an
[50.15s -> 60.14s]  original Xbox hard drive to play this game. That's like a bite my finger. Okay. Now what
[60.58s -> 67.30s]  do I do? Because I don't have one of those. I don't own one of those. So I have to get some
[67.30s -> 76.04s]  third party. But I'm not going to put that on here. How do you attach an original Xbox hard
[76.04s -> 87.82s]  drive to an Xbox 360? I don't understand. It's a 360 hard drive. That's not what it said. It said
[87.82s -> 101.83s]  I need an original Xbox hard drive. Play it on PC. It's probably very hard to get that game to run
[101.83s -> 109.58s]  on PC. I'm scared to buy it on and try to get it on PC because it probably doesn't work. The 360
[109.58s -> 117.31s]  hard drive can do. But this doesn't have a hard drive in it. Whatever. All right. I'll figure that
[117.31s -> 127.22s]  out over the next couple of days. I want to play Tony Hawk too. Buy it on PC. I gotta find it too.
[127.22s -> 134.54s]  All right. So we're doing a pivot here. We're doing a hard pivot. And this is a game that I
[134.62s -> 138.98s]  have that I bought that I know I was going to play it eventually and knew during an Xbox stream.
[138.98s -> 150.26s]  This was very, very highly requested. This is Asura's wrath. I heard it's crazy. So I'm like,
[150.26s -> 161.74s]  all right, I'll get it. The arcade slim 360 doesn't have one. Holy shit. This shit is nuts.
[161.74s -> 169.46s]  All right. Yeah, let's go. This is a hard pivot and I got plenty of hard pivots. This game fucking
[169.46s -> 176.50s]  sucks compared to Tony Hawk. But don't worry. I have it behind me. I just need like an Xbox
[176.50s -> 186.82s]  hard drive. I didn't know that. I wasn't personally contacted by Phil. Let me tweet this out. We'll
[186.82s -> 235.96s]  start in a minute. I'll be back in like two minutes. All right. What is this? What is this
[235.96s -> 244.06s]  game? Not even an HD? What? Are you serious? Look at this game. Look at this. What is this game? Not
[244.94s -> 258.26s]  That's some crazy music going on in the background here. Look at this. Quick apologize. I don't have
[258.26s -> 263.83s]  to apologize for anything. There are no, I, I'm going to, I'm going to seem to make a statement
[263.83s -> 272.15s]  here. I am not going to apologize once on this screen. Okay. I don't need to apologize for
[272.15s -> 276.79s]  anything. I actually saw somebody talk about this recently. They said he doesn't have to fucking
[276.79s -> 282.46s]  apologize. He'd do whatever he wants. And I was like, thank you. Thank you for saying that. I
[282.46s -> 289.83s]  do whatever I want. That being said, I'm very sorry if you happen to find something in this
[289.83s -> 301.38s]  game that you know, just kidding. The sir is rat. Here we go. Can we just play on fucking David?
[302.02s -> 316.90s]  Does it really matter? No, I need to be able to like, no, I'm going on my shitty account. Oh, come
[316.90s -> 339.67s]  on. Let me just, a 620 fucking K update. What is it? Did you change a background image there?
[339.67s -> 351.48s]  What do you even possibly update with a 600 K update? That this text was changed. Get it together.
[351.48s -> 355.72s]  By the way, this is from Capcom. One of the best fucking video game companies currently right now.
[355.72s -> 367.21s]  They're really killing it. It's an HD now. Ooh, that'd be cool if it was. All right. Cool. Is it
[367.21s -> 383.75s]  an HD? Wait, does it? Is it an HD now? Why does it look different? A new episode has arrived. Lost
[383.75s -> 396.01s]  episode two. The new episode has arrived. Lost episode one. The show lost. All right.
[398.14s -> 403.54s]  Oh, why only the first two episodes? I don't understand. JJ Abrams. A new episode has arrived.
[403.54s -> 413.45s]  Episode pack part four. A new episode has arrived. Episode 11.5. A new episode of TV has arrived.
[413.45s -> 425.35s]  Episode 15.5. There's a lot of random TV shows. I just opened up a sir's wrath's torrent folder.
[425.83s -> 442.28s]  New game. It's like the difficulty. All right. This is a hard game. Players who want to enjoy
[442.28s -> 447.16s]  the story. Players who want to seek revenge on those who betrayed them. Players who want to
[447.16s -> 454.94s]  unleash their wrath. Hard. No, no. Be real. Be real. This is like, this game's like 10 years old.
[454.94s -> 466.57s]  Is hard too hard? Do it. Is it too hard? Normal please. All right. Hold on. Is VR Josh here right
[466.57s -> 470.09s]  now? Because VR Josh was one of the people that recommended this game. VR Josh, are you here?
[470.97s -> 484.39s]  Help me. I need to know. I trust you. I only saw cutscenes. What? What do you mean you only saw
[484.39s -> 491.48s]  cutscenes? You've, this is like a direct recommendation. You only, what, you watched
[491.48s -> 500.18s]  the cutscene on YouTube? The cutscene movie? You never even played the game? I hope this wasn't a
[500.18s -> 519.24s]  fucking mistake. This game is almost entirely cutscenes. Is it? The ending of this game is
[519.24s -> 529.45s]  locked behind DLC. Oh, great. Paramount pictures? What? Oh, what? I thought that was spelling
[529.45s -> 531.85s]  paramount. I was like, holy shit, that's kind of cool.
[557.82s -> 572.79s]  Developed by Capcom. Pretty good extensive use of the Unreal Engine 3 lighting effects.
[573.35s -> 587.62s]  I like that bright yellow light is in every game and from 2012 to like 2016. Wait, didn't I already
[587.62s -> 602.81s]  press start? I already pressed start. What? Okay. Press start again. Oh shit. Lock on fire.
[603.45s -> 613.29s]  What am I firing at? Is this like Star Fox?
[623.35s -> 633.42s]  What the fuck is that? What is going on? Did I kill it? I would like it if there was not text all of
[633.42s -> 656.23s]  the screen. Whoa. Rapid fire X. Am I dead? It's cinematic. Oh. All right, for a second I didn't
[656.23s -> 662.15s]  know what those buttons were. I was like, what is GS? It was right stick. I was fucked it up.
[663.11s -> 678.44s]  Is your Xbox running in 1080? It's rough on the eyes. Yeah. Yeah, it is. This game,
[678.44s -> 682.20s]  what's on the back of the box? Does this game even have 1080p as an option?
[684.12s -> 705.53s]  A 720p 1080i 1080p. It should be. No, it's not. Hold on. How do I check? Check your Xbox settings.
[706.17s -> 717.43s]  Settings. Preferences. What's it under? Preferences. System settings.
[718.15s -> 721.59s]  As you'll end your current session. Let me get to like a save point first. Sorry. No, no, no.
[722.31s -> 739.62s]  It's fine. I think it just looks like this, guys. No, it's definitely 1080. Because it wouldn't be
[740.42s -> 744.98s]  fucked up looking on my other screen. This is 1080. Guys, this is 2012 1080.
[745.86s -> 767.35s]  It's beat. Brightness on 200%. You know what? You know what? It might be. Let's check. All right,
[767.35s -> 791.51s]  coming to the QT. Is that better? It's better, right? Yeah, that's better. All right. Yeah,
[791.51s -> 797.10s]  the brightness was up for some reason. Good job catching that. I wouldn't have thought that.
[797.10s -> 802.81s]  Hold on. I got to go back.
[807.37s -> 810.23s]  I'm back.
[810.87s -> 819.19s]  The impure have defiled and scorched our land, but it is we who shall live to see tomorrow's light.
[820.23s -> 828.39s]  Legion of demigods, heed your priestess's words and purify your lamps and for all.
[829.27s -> 833.59s]  That sounds like one of the dragons in Warcraft. Let us offer Gaia the greatest blessing.
[834.47s -> 836.95s]  I'm sorry. Let me rephrase that. Any dragon in Warcraft.
[848.68s -> 853.00s]  This is actually kind of cool. Big, cool enemies. When do I get to play the game?
[855.16s -> 865.18s]  Oh, look at that. I want to be that demigod. This is the game. No, it's not. This is not the game.
[865.18s -> 872.38s]  This is like the first little tutorial cinematic part of the game. This is not the full game.
[873.26s -> 888.97s]  I remember the health bar. This is not the game. It's the opening cut scene.
[900.28s -> 905.80s]  What do you mean he seriously doesn't know? This is not the game. This is the opening cut scene.
[923.08s -> 947.05s]  That was a pretty sick Derva Raptor. That was the exact noise. Let's go. You're halfway done with
[947.21s -> 973.19s]  the game. The whole game is just an E3 demo. No, the eight guardian generals.
[985.90s -> 990.46s]  There he is. The eight guardian generals. Asura.
[1006.47s -> 1016.41s]  I know this is not the actual game because games aren't hard. This is not hard. This is
[1016.57s -> 1021.05s]  not a game at all, actually. So how could it be hard?
[1039.96s -> 1060.42s]  The game won't register how fast I can do it. Sorry, guys. What is going on?
[1066.86s -> 1069.99s]  Apologize.
[1069.99s -> 1083.75s]  Nice. Oh, nice. You're at level two. Nice. Level two. Here I come.
[1083.75s -> 1097.21s]  Go.
[1108.23s -> 1113.51s]  Why are we just all sitting in a Google Hangout? Don't we have Earth to save? I don't understand.
[1113.51s -> 1130.98s]  Okay, there's supposed to be eight generals. I think that's like 12.
[1141.32s -> 1147.88s]  The music's too loud. I can't even hear what he's saying.
[1152.01s -> 1167.50s]  They made the music too loud. Remember, you just triggered my Google Home.
[1172.20s -> 1175.40s]  Get your Google Home away from the speakers of your computer.
[1176.36s -> 1185.88s]  Can you hear that sometimes? Dude, what the fuck? Alexa just started responding to me.
[1186.68s -> 1194.90s]  Is Alexa in your headset? No, put Alexa in your fucking living room and turn the volume down.
[1195.78s -> 1198.82s]  Not in your office. No, office in quotes.
[1199.38s -> 1216.09s]  It shows how serious we are about winning.
[1219.53s -> 1228.30s]  This game looks fucking dumb. Okay, this game was $60 when it came out. I have no idea how much it
[1228.30s -> 1236.70s]  is now. I really don't know how much this was. It might still be $60. I have no idea. All right,
[1236.70s -> 1246.60s]  we made it to the impurity level. Holy shit, wait, did the Earth just turn into a monster?
[1247.56s -> 1266.90s]  Well, we were not prepared for this. Okay, we're getting a commercial break.
[1268.66s -> 1283.21s]  Yes, this is actually the anime has the commercial break. All we needed right there was a voiceover.
[1291.69s -> 1296.89s]  Here we go. Am I going to float around and shoot things out of my eyes or whatever it is?
[1297.61s -> 1299.77s]  Oh, metal. Full metal alchemist.
[1303.82s -> 1308.54s]  The worst part about those is it says it twice. You don't need to say it on the return,
[1309.26s -> 1317.50s]  especially when you're watching a repeat of it for a DVD or on Netflix, whatever. And it goes
[1317.50s -> 1322.78s]  full metal alchemist, full metal alchemist. It's like you don't just cut that second one out.
[1322.78s -> 1338.23s]  Like where's the quality control? This is the longest opening ever.
[1340.15s -> 1345.88s]  What's your business?
[1349.21s -> 1356.31s]  Are there levels? This is a third person action game? I think, no, it is, right? How long is this
[1356.31s -> 1389.80s]  game? Wait, wait, wait. No, this is not it. This is like a third person Bayonetta kind of game,
[1389.80s -> 1407.38s]  right? Like devil may cry. Yeah. No, he really believes that. No, I do.
[1415.26s -> 1424.10s]  No, this is. Oh shit. In 16 years of playing games, I've never seen anything like Asura's
[1424.10s -> 1436.23s]  wrath is the quote from IGN. That doesn't mean good. That doesn't say this is very fun to play.
[1441.02s -> 1448.95s]  It means it means it's it's different dot dot dot dot. Interesting. It's interesting.
[1449.91s -> 1456.28s]  And all the stuff in the back of the box. Yeah, there's no, I don't know what I did.
[1457.00s -> 1459.26s]  I'm going to give it a chance. No, I'm not going to. This is what we're doing.
[1474.70s -> 1488.02s]  16 years of playing games. What? Am I dead? All right. You can take that quote in 16 years
[1488.02s -> 1493.14s]  of playing games. I've never seen anything like this. It was so bad. It's the worst game I played
[1493.14s -> 1505.53s]  in 16 years. That quote could be like, in all my years, I've never seen anything so bad.
[1533.83s -> 1535.27s]  This game is good. I know it is.
[1561.75s -> 1581.05s]  What troubles you? Wait, Asura is a street fighter character.
[1581.05s -> 1589.93s]  I could not kill it. No one can kill Vlytra. You should be grateful you were able to subdue it.
[1593.99s -> 1598.71s]  We have suffered more casualties than ever, but it will not be back for a while.
[1598.71s -> 1606.89s]  You should rest. Asura. Due to General Asura's efforts, Vlytra has subsided.
[1610.10s -> 1614.42s]  No, he's Asura's in-street fighter. Confused.
[1629.94s -> 1630.66s]  The costume.
[1645.24s -> 1650.42s]  Soon you will get to play a video game. Episode one.
[1650.98s -> 1672.94s]  I got an A. I'm good. New concept art has been added. War of creation.
[1673.74s -> 1688.04s]  A new video has been added. Episode one. All right. All right. Let's go.
[1692.44s -> 1698.52s]  Episode one of Germacraft has been unlocked. Episode one. Coming of a new dream.
[1699.32s -> 1706.34s]  Short interludes in between the episodes are displayed to further explain the story.
[1712.70s -> 1717.93s]  All right. Let's go. Congratulations, Commander. We have once again succeeded in suppressing.
[1719.35s -> 1722.63s]  That means nothing, and time will be back and pose an even greater threat than today.
[1723.43s -> 1726.87s]  That vile beast destroying will be more troublesome than I had anticipated, and
[1726.87s -> 1729.35s]  who would have thought that Helion Asura would be the one to quell-
[1730.23s -> 1733.59s]  That was only possible because we have a comic book in- all right, so the first part of the
[1733.67s -> 1739.30s]  game was an interactive movie, and now the second part of the game here is a comic book.
[1740.02s -> 1751.34s]  The third part of the game will be playing a video game. It was only possible because
[1751.34s -> 1760.95s]  they had aid of the priestess. Okay. Yes, his daughter Mithra. We might very well owe our
[1760.95s -> 1765.35s]  victory solely to her. The priestess proves to be more useful than Emperor Strata himself.
[1766.31s -> 1773.35s]  Okay, perhaps I said too much. No. Well, yes. Yes, you have. Just a little bit.
[1774.78s -> 1779.42s]  Okay. All right. Can I have like an earpiece while I fight that, like, you can tell me the
[1779.42s -> 1783.82s]  rest in my earpiece? Hmm, arcing the power. Her power will be a vital step in acknowledging our-
[1784.46s -> 1788.62s]  Indeed, her ability to amplify mantra is quite remarkable. You would never guess that mindless
[1788.62s -> 1793.10s]  brute to be her father. I suggest we intervene for the priestess's sake. He is a potential
[1793.10s -> 1798.78s]  danger to our plans. Not just yet, he can still be useful to us. Haven't had any new info from
[1799.50s -> 1812.42s]  For now, we must concentrate on completing the karma fortress as well as finding more efficient.
[1812.42s -> 1817.38s]  Give it a chance. Hold on. Just give it a chance. This game's only like four and a half hours long.
[1817.38s -> 1823.18s]  Just give it a moment. Just wait a minute. Without that, first assured commander, I have
[1823.18s -> 1828.71s]  already devised a plan for it all, including the priestess. Just skip the filler episodes.
[1828.71s -> 1835.59s]  This is not- Okay, episode one is not a filler episode. If episode one is a filler episode of
[1835.59s -> 1842.78s]  your TV show, holy fuck, you did it wrong. Very well. Perceive his plan. Failure is not an option.
[1844.76s -> 1851.24s]  Priestess Mithra lent her power to the Shinkoku army and all of Gaia rejoiced at the victory over
[1851.24s -> 1857.48s]  Vlytra. But this time- What happened in episode one? For in the shadows of victory, the wheels of
[1857.48s -> 1862.68s]  betrayal had already been set in motion. One that would shake the very foundation- Is this a preview?
[1863.40s -> 1868.55s]  Did this game come out? No, it didn't. It's the- I didn't skip anything.
[1869.75s -> 1881.96s]  Go to the next episode. It was an episode one recap? Skip the previews. It's going to spoil things, okay?
[1883.78s -> 1897.26s]  The day after the defeat of V- whatever. How do I get QTEs to walk and like,
[1897.98s -> 1906.15s]  shake hands and wave and shit? See, no one's ever went full fucking absolute QTE. I want a QTE where
[1906.15s -> 1910.07s]  every button is me. I have to press A every time I take a step. Like, I have to do QTEs right now.
[1910.71s -> 1921.22s]  And if I fail, I have to start the whole thing over. Asura! Oh, that's- that's- that's wife.
[1923.19s -> 1935.50s]  Father! All right, easy. It's like tripped three times. You're safe. I am.
[1939.72s -> 1952.54s]  She failed the QTE. Asura, the emperor summons you. He awaits your presence in the throne room.
[1952.54s -> 1958.26s]  I wonder if he's going to present you with a medal for defeating Vlytra. She's right. You
[1958.26s -> 1970.82s]  mustn't keep the emperor waiting. All right. This is like an android or something?
[1971.62s -> 1978.02s]  These fucking frames. It's 2012 1080p, don't you know? They cared so much about having a huge
[1978.02s -> 1984.39s]  resolution. Games- the Xbox 360 couldn't run this shit at like more than 20 frames a second,
[1984.39s -> 1993.29s]  but it was like 1080p. Having a game at 720 or like 480 was like, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1993.29s -> 2006.78s]  excuse me. Don't do that. Ugly. Oh shit, it said press A. I pressed B. Oh fuck. These are hard.
[2007.42s -> 2028.38s]  What'd you do? Everybody's failing QTEs.
[2038.60s -> 2043.08s]  Uh, all right, so they think I did it. It's the- it's the classic I didn't do it,
[2044.20s -> 2051.00s]  but I have- I have blood all over my hands, so it has to be me. That's classic.
[2051.32s -> 2074.18s]  Understand what's happening. Still, part one. What episode is this? Wait, episode two,
[2074.18s -> 2078.98s]  part one. Episode two, betrayal and vengeance of part one of episode two.
[2080.50s -> 2090.57s]  It wasn't me. Why do you have to have anything named after me? Episode two, part one of episode two.
[2090.57s -> 2103.75s]  Episode two, part one of episode three. Here we go. Gameplay. Press B attack.
[2107.11s -> 2124.14s]  That was pretty fun. Just do heavy attack. It's easy.
[2125.98s -> 2138.22s]  The FPS. Yeah, don't you know? In stunning 1080p. Graphics absolutely stunning.
[2138.94s -> 2182.66s]  Basura's wrath. Basura's wrath. I think the rule- the moral of the story here is don't ever,
[2182.66s -> 2188.12s]  like, touch anyone. That's- you know what I mean? Like, what- what are they- what are they- what are
[2188.12s -> 2196.26s]  they dead? Do they have your blood on your hands? She just came up behind and, like, put her hand on
[2196.26s -> 2199.78s]  her back. What if she was dead and you had blood all over your hands? Don't fucking ever. Always
[2199.78s -> 2218.90s]  make sure the person's alive first. That is- kill this guy? Oh, that's kind of cool. Oh, well, I
[2218.90s -> 2236.76s]  thought- I thought A was dead. Do I have a health bar? Can you die in this game? Oh, perfect. Perfect
[2236.76s -> 2255.45s]  QTE. I won. Dude, he got one. That's one of the eight. You know what the best part about
[2255.45s -> 2263.16s]  full sprint close-up run is in any form of video? Your- the suspension of disbelief is if they cut
[2263.16s -> 2270.17s]  to, like, he- he's, like, in another country, it's like, oh, okay, that makes sense. Oh, don't touch
[2270.73s -> 2276.62s]  her! Don't go- don't- no, no, no, get away! No, no, you idiot! Didn't you just learn anything?
[2277.88s -> 2306.25s]  You! Who did this? Oh, shit, it wasn't me! This- I swear! Have you learned nothing? QTE her back to
[2306.25s -> 2341.06s]  life. I don't think that's how this works. Who's that? Hold on. Isn't this, like, the exact story
[2341.06s -> 2349.37s]  of God of War? The exact story. Didn't this- didn't this happen in God of War? Kind of.
[2349.85s -> 2377.46s]  Awesome. Yes, play that. But wha- why are you in there? You can't see with that on. Why would you
[2377.46s -> 2400.98s]  put that on? Yeah, necessary for civilization. Uh, not that concerned about the guy that can't see
[2400.98s -> 2406.18s]  right now. I can't see anything. I could throw a rock at that guy's head and it would probably
[2406.18s -> 2425.29s]  knock him out and I could beat that guy. Not even eye holes. I don't know why I'm thinking-
[2425.29s -> 2431.35s]  I'm looking way too much into that one. But really, that's just a big piece of metal covering your
[2431.35s -> 2481.90s]  eyes. I didn't fail with my QTE. I'm going over the edge. Next Smash Brothers character?
[2482.94s -> 2494.63s]  Oh, he's already in season three fighter. He's getting zapped back to level one.
[2495.03s -> 2506.18s]  What? Can't I fly? Wasn't I just flying? Just fly. You know how to fly.
[2508.34s -> 2529.26s]  I know how to fly. Well, all right, well, she's got turned into an N64 character.
[2530.62s -> 2543.16s]  You've just degraded her graphics quality. Uh-oh, that's not good. I kind of turned her into a cake.
[2543.96s -> 2549.93s]  She just turned into a cake. All right, to be continued.
[2558.20s -> 2561.16s]  Did I even have to do anything? Oh, I had to fight a little bit. Yeah.
[2562.36s -> 2565.88s]  Look, I got S. This one's hard too. Imagine playing this one. Easy.
[2570.25s -> 2577.94s]  A new video has been added so you can just watch them. All right, let's go.
[2582.33s -> 2587.05s]  You're gonna end up with zero viewers. No, I'm not. Relax.
[2587.05s -> 2598.55s]  So this is like fake about me.
[2617.02s -> 2620.06s]  Yes, this is like fake. This has been made up about me, right?
[2623.82s -> 2626.62s]  Yeah, like they scapegoated me, right?
[2663.91s -> 2668.71s]  Under the command of the great deus, they fought heroically against their brother who betrayed them
[2668.71s -> 2675.19s]  and avenged their emperor's death by sending Asura to his own. Henceforth, they became known as the
[2675.19s -> 2681.72s]  seven deities and they watch over the humans from the heavens, but they don't have a great marketing
[2681.72s -> 2690.76s]  team because pretty boring. We were the eight, now we're the seven. That's it. This is minus one.
[2694.84s -> 2700.60s]  All he has left is his wrath. Refusing to die, Asura awakens in a strange world.
[2700.60s -> 2705.16s]  Oh, it's Asura. There, a small mysterious spider. All right, all right. You skip, skip. Yeah,
[2705.16s -> 2707.96s]  we're watching the preview for the next episode, right? I don't know. I didn't... All right,
[2707.96s -> 2719.38s]  whatever. Does it really matter? Doesn't matter. Oh my god, there was a spider there. You know what
[2719.38s -> 2743.10s]  that means. Don't skip Dan's game. We're still getting opening cutscenes credits. Oh, thank god
[2743.10s -> 2753.14s]  he grabbed onto that edge. How long are you even doing that for? Episode three, hell on Nogaya.
[2780.87s -> 2783.83s]  The golden, the golden friendly spider.
[2787.75s -> 2791.94s]  I hope you guys just started to like the game.
[2801.96s -> 2808.84s]  Five thousand bits just came in from phylactery. Five thousand bits. Fifty dollars. Please play
[2808.84s -> 2816.02s]  this whole game. The boss fights are a huge, such a huge spectacle to see. I mean, we're here, so
[2816.82s -> 2825.03s]  I didn't fail this. You can't fail this. What if I press down? I cannot fail that.
[2826.79s -> 2834.65s]  Up you go. Yes, there is a reason why you must continue to climb. But thanks for the
[2834.65s -> 2840.06s]  50 dollars phylactery. We're here. I got no other plan. Man, I was gonna play Tony Hawk, but I need
[2840.06s -> 2845.34s]  a fucking hard drive, but I didn't know that because I'm stupid. That's it. Keep going. I'm
[2845.34s -> 2849.02s]  not even that stupid. I'm actually pretty smart. I'm pretty... I would say I'm like average
[2849.02s -> 2852.94s]  intelligence. I am. I am. We make jokes on this channel, but I'm... I know what I'm doing.
[2853.42s -> 2869.05s]  These are our enemies. Tutorial. The impure goma. Let's see what you make of them. Wait, isn't this
[2869.05s -> 2877.77s]  one of the seven? I already... I already know how to do this. This is tutorial two. This is tutorial
[2877.77s -> 2890.74s]  two, part two, episode two, part one. Every heavy attack causes Asura to overheat for a period of
[2890.74s -> 2902.50s]  time. Heavy attacks cannot be used while overheating. This is cool. This game is so hype. I love it.
[2902.50s -> 2908.98s]  Yeah, I see everyone is relaxed. That's because the first hour of the game is a TV show.
[2914.33s -> 2921.72s]  But while you're overheating, you can't... Yeah, you can't. Hold B to perform a dash attack.
[2923.72s -> 2926.68s]  Dude, this is just like DMC, man. This is just like DMC.
[2927.64s -> 2950.38s]  Wow, I love this game. It's just like fucking DMC 2. After pressing A, hold B to... DMC 2 was the shitty
[2950.38s -> 2957.72s]  one. Oh, sorry. I have not played one second of any of the Devil May Cry games. Not one second.
[2958.52s -> 2964.34s]  Press Y to execute a special attack when your enemy is down. Especially... Yeah, I know how to do that.
[2968.39s -> 2976.81s]  Good. I thought people loved those games. What are you talking about? You're a fake Capcom fan.
[2977.69s -> 2995.91s]  I never claimed to be a real Capcom fan. What? People love them all except DMC 2.
[2996.71s -> 3001.16s]  No. No, you're telling me I picked the one that... the one that everybody hates?
[3001.88s -> 3017.27s]  Uh-oh. Big boy. Asura can recover directly after being hit by pressing A. Recovering reduces damage
[3017.27s -> 3021.91s]  and allows Asura to quickly get back into a fighting stance. So I get knocked down
[3022.79s -> 3030.39s]  after immediately after getting hit. They have to hit the ground first. So... Oh, we missed. Come on.
[3031.59s -> 3049.50s]  Let's go. Oh, finally an evade. Now this is my game. Oh, yeah. Dodge roll.
[3052.46s -> 3057.82s]  Like, there's no way I lose now. You guys know me in a dodge roll. It's... I'm so good with a dodge
[3057.90s -> 3062.78s]  roll. Four buttons. Dodge roll. I will not have a single problem in this game.
[3064.30s -> 3068.55s]  Press the correct on-screen prompt right before an enemy attacks to execute a counter-attack.
[3070.46s -> 3085.10s]  Dodge roll, baby. Yup. Again? Here again. This game is the equivalent of somebody saying,
[3085.10s -> 3088.62s]  trust me, this show is good. You just have to get past three episodes.
[3090.89s -> 3102.89s]  Yeah, kind of. And then by the time you get to pass the third episode and you're on the
[3103.45s -> 3107.53s]  couch and they look over at you and they can tell that you're not into it, they know that they've
[3107.53s -> 3111.93s]  failed. And they're just sitting there going, god damn it, they're not into this at all. And
[3111.93s -> 3117.77s]  they should be at this point and they're not. So I'm just gonna give them an out. And you give
[3117.77s -> 3122.81s]  them an out simply by saying something like this. All right, that's three episodes in. I mean,
[3122.81s -> 3128.73s]  that's a lot of TV. Yeah, it's a pretty cool show. We can do something else. I'm gonna take the DVD
[3128.73s -> 3135.77s]  out. I'll take it out. And then they either go, yeah, yeah, that's a lot of TV. Three episodes
[3135.77s -> 3138.65s]  before. That's a lot of TV. You're right. That's pretty cool, though. That's when you know,
[3138.65s -> 3142.01s]  take the fucking DVD out and do something else. They don't want to watch the show and they never
[3142.01s -> 3157.80s]  will. Hold X for rapid fire. Oh, I actually have to aim this thing. Why can't I just do that
[3157.80s -> 3167.05s]  normally? Why would I ever punch with my fist? And then you never watch it or bring it up ever
[3167.05s -> 3175.62s]  again. And then you feel terrible because you love this show. And you're like, fuck, man, I just
[3175.62s -> 3181.46s]  watched three episodes of this show. I'm gonna keep going. And then you get like 25 episodes in
[3181.46s -> 3189.21s]  because this is like the fourth time you've watched the show. And they might come up to you at some
[3189.21s -> 3192.25s]  point in the future and be like, hey, dude, you want to watch like episode four? And you're like,
[3192.25s -> 3197.75s]  fuck, I don't want to watch the show again from the beginning again. We had a chance and now I
[3197.75s -> 3203.98s]  already went like two seasons ahead of this. Now I have to watch it again. I know. I've been there
[3203.98s -> 3221.13s]  before. Trust me, guys. You can use rapid fire to shoot it in analog aiming. Why is he teaching me
[3221.13s -> 3236.36s]  this? I didn't start. I haven't stopped. What is he shooting from? Spines on his back. That's what I
[3236.36s -> 3247.82s]  gather from this. This is a flashback. You idiot. Sorry. Sorry. I wasn't aware we were in episode
[3247.82s -> 3263.29s]  three part one of the second part of the second tutorial. Apologizing. You already said that joke.
[3263.29s -> 3268.76s]  I'm gonna say it again because it's very relevant right now. Don't apologize. I'm not apologizing.
[3268.76s -> 3275.11s]  No, I'm not sorry. All right. Inflicting and receiving damage increases the unlimited gauge.
[3275.11s -> 3281.43s]  Once it's full unlimited mode can be activated by pressing LT. Automatically activated in easy mode.
[3281.43s -> 3308.07s]  Okay. Fill up the unlimited gauge by attacking. Where am I? I wish there was a block.
[3308.63s -> 3321.75s]  Oh, why can I not lock on? Isn't LB lock on? How do you fill it if it's unlimited?
[3323.19s -> 3336.02s]  I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine. That's a lot of bar to fill up.
[3336.98s -> 3349.53s]  That's full. Now use it by left trigger. In unlimited mode, Asura's strength is increased
[3349.53s -> 3366.20s]  and he cannot overheat. But I just can keep. Inflicting damage upon enemies increases the burst
[3366.20s -> 3371.16s]  gauge. Once it's full, burst can be activated by pressing RT and unleashing a devastating attack.
[3371.16s -> 3390.98s]  Okay. I have two gauges. Higher DPS. Do you level up in this game? No wonder. I'm gonna try this.
[3390.98s -> 3405.91s]  There you go. Why the exact moment of impact increases your
[3405.91s -> 3410.15s]  synchronic rate with Asura? Do you have a high enough synchronic rate and get?
[3415.88s -> 3449.30s]  What? Get what? That's a cool sword. Is that a machine gun? That was like distant machine gun fire.
[3449.30s -> 3449.78s]  What was that?
[3470.58s -> 3478.01s]  This spider is probably worth a lot of money. I mean that is coming in jewels and shit.
[3484.90s -> 3487.70s]  Solid gold spider covered in sapphires.
[3493.06s -> 3500.38s]  Where are we now? Where am I? Where am I?
[3500.38s -> 3528.66s]  All right. All right. I get it. Not bad. It's pretty fucking fun. Yeah, it's pretty fucking
[3528.66s -> 3536.41s]  fun. I imagine that that I'm saying that while I have a crying face. It's pretty fun guys.
[3549.30s -> 3556.76s]  Play Hulk Ultimate Destruction Resonance Leaper. Well, I recommend it then. You can't just come to
[3556.76s -> 3562.20s]  the screen and be like, hey dude, why is this called Hulk Ultimate Destruction for the fucking
[3562.20s -> 3581.80s]  weed? I don't have that game. Let's go. That guy has a point. I don't have that game. Should
[3581.80s -> 3603.02s]  I get it? Is that game fun? The ultimate in Unreal 3 lighting.
[3610.44s -> 3616.28s]  You know, I could do this with the OBS sliders. In fact, I feel like I've done it already.
[3621.13s -> 3645.56s]  Do it. Unregistered Hypercam. No, it will be unregistered weed. I don't know why and I'm
[3645.56s -> 3649.48s]  going to probably make a lot of people angry with this, but I feel like that's how Twilight
[3649.48s -> 3654.02s]  Princess looks the whole time. Did I just make anybody angry? I may have.
[3658.38s -> 3669.78s]  It's not a bad game. I'm still angry though.
[3696.49s -> 3700.41s]  It's at this point where I go, all right, listen, buddy. You tell me exactly what's going on or I'm
[3700.41s -> 3705.14s]  breaking a leg off and making a million. I mean, I'm just going to stop. I'm taking a fall. I'm
[3705.14s -> 3722.87s]  taking a leg. Tell me what's going on. The next time you talk in a riddle, I'm
[3722.87s -> 3756.17s]  melting you down into a necklace. It'll be that easy. He's very angry. Did you get the DLC for
[3756.17s -> 3761.86s]  this? No. I did not.
[3773.86s -> 3788.09s]  I can't get the ending without it. Who's this? How you save the world? This place looks like hell.
[3793.61s -> 3804.20s]  This is you after Simpsons hit and run. How many episodes are there in the, I almost said show and
[3804.20s -> 3807.80s]  I would have been right, but how many episodes are in there? Part one, episode three. How many
[3807.80s -> 3826.82s]  parts and how many episodes? 13 episodes? 15 parts? All right. I was told skip the next part
[3826.82s -> 3840.94s]  because I don't, we don't want spoilers. It's 12 parts total, seven episodes. 12 parts in seven,
[3841.66s -> 3853.42s]  two episodes per part? A barren land somewhere on Gaia, the golden spider. What do you think?
[3853.42s -> 3858.54s]  It's become a tad desolate since you were here last. I can hear thunder in the distance. Can
[3858.54s -> 3865.58s]  you see the lightning? It is as red as blood. So you remember, yes, the threat of the Goma still
[3865.58s -> 3870.62s]  remains even now. Curious as to what your former comrades have been doing. Over there, have a look.
[3871.66s -> 3882.89s]  They looked at Goma. Not quite. This was the work of your own race, the demigods.
[3883.61s -> 3888.65s]  What? They now have control over the world as they do please as much as they want to.
[3888.65s -> 3902.38s]  Paraphrasing, actors do that. Changing the few words around. That can't be. A lot can change
[3902.38s -> 3907.50s]  in 12,000 years. If you don't believe me, why don't you go see for yourself? Shut up.
[3908.22s -> 3913.27s]  There's that famous Asura anger. Well then, this world shall be your playground.
[3914.74s -> 3918.90s]  After a long slumber, Asura. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. No, there's a bell in this one.
[3918.90s -> 3923.93s]  Fuck. I'm done. Somebody hits a bell and shit and it's probably very important.
[3925.19s -> 3936.89s]  All right, next episode. Bell spoiled. I'm so fucking mad right now. Fucking stupid fucking
[3936.89s -> 3945.67s]  thing. I just want to be spoiler free. Like what the fuck? Mr. God. I haven't seen like
[3945.67s -> 3952.54s]  Star Wars episode three yet. Like no, not the sequel. I'm talking about like the actual like
[3952.54s -> 3978.55s]  the prequel trilogy. Don't fucking talk about it. What's wrong with me? I'm angry. All right,
[3978.55s -> 3986.23s]  I used all my anger powers and now I'm a little slowed down. This is post anger. Oh, I have to
[3986.23s -> 3996.02s]  go this way. Don't talk to me. I'm angry. Yeah, this really is like the don't. Kids playing down
[3996.02s -> 4000.44s]  here. I remember when it used to be quiet.
[4027.26s -> 4034.22s]  They added a 5G tower too. I knew that was gonna happen. Fucking angry. God damn it. I knew that
[4034.22s -> 4037.26s]  was gonna happen. I'm so mad that we saw that.
[4050.86s -> 4053.34s]  This really is just he's very angry walking around.
[4062.06s -> 4065.42s]  That's the face that a little kid makes when they don't get to ride the ride at Disney.
[4073.82s -> 4085.53s]  Do you want some lunch? No. Do you want to insert your favorite thing that I know you love?
[4086.33s -> 4132.12s]  No, but they do get reversed. I do have a health bar. It's just Batman. It's just Batman.
[4132.92s -> 4142.25s]  It's Batman with a much, much larger window to actually walk in. This is Batman,
[4142.25s -> 4145.37s]  but the game freezes and tells you the button to press for five seconds.
[4145.37s -> 4167.59s]  Well, purification for private joji. I'll have the same line.
[4168.23s -> 4171.59s]  Destruction, destruction, destruction, destruction.
[4198.98s -> 4201.86s]  Okay, who made this? I know Capcom, but what's Capcom? Which Capcom?
[4201.86s -> 4227.21s]  What Capcom studio?
[4230.50s -> 4235.88s]  Almost dead. Why is he fighting these things?
[4244.76s -> 4261.29s]  Cyber what? Capcom Canada. Is that a real company? CyberConnect. CyberConnect 2.
[4263.99s -> 4274.06s]  Unregistered HyperCam 2. Unregistered CyberConnect 2.
[4274.78s -> 4287.72s]  All ships, prepare for purification. Didn't we already beat this guy?
[4289.32s -> 4305.99s]  All ships, release. Wait, back to back bosses. What a lucky turn to find the traitor.
[4311.64s -> 4314.60s]  All right. Whoa.
[4318.76s -> 4327.35s]  Not quite. He's on the ground though. Get him. Get up. Get the combo up.
[4334.49s -> 4337.86s]  All right. That hurts a lot. I'm actually going to die.
[4338.74s -> 4356.97s]  I'm going to build up my QTE meter. I hope I don't have to do hard.
[4358.01s -> 4364.42s]  Oh, it's all right. I'll be all right. Everything's going to be fine. Don't worry.
[4366.50s -> 4379.67s]  He's almost dead. I don't want to use my QTE thing. I almost got him.
[4380.15s -> 4405.69s]  He's on. Okay. Bonehug Crusher. Impurity level 680. It's now I have to fight a giant
[4406.33s -> 4422.23s]  elephant. Just keep getting more and more logical. What did he just do? I was eating their souls.
[4424.79s -> 4442.89s]  Did they get to go back into the bodies? Nope. Right now he's sitting there going.
[4443.69s -> 4449.21s]  Is it dead? Is this fucking thing dead? I hope so. What did I be doing?
[4459.34s -> 4473.48s]  There's always a bigger fish. We go. We do it again. Let's go. No. Next episode, we'll do that.
[4480.09s -> 4483.93s]  I'm going to be completely honest. What the fuck is the point of that?
[4484.41s -> 4490.01s]  This game's interesting. I like this game. It's actually interesting, but what is the point of
[4490.01s -> 4511.85s]  that? It's not TV. Why is it there? Pacing commercial, but there's no commercial.
[4512.89s -> 4527.86s]  It'd be funny if there was commercials, like made up products. The Seven Deities. Wisen.
[4527.86s -> 4559.27s]  What? I can do that? Shut him up.
[4570.04s -> 4586.55s]  Your wrath too? Let's go. All right. Does it dash? I can't lock on. Come on. He's on the ground. I
[4586.55s -> 4597.11s]  can't. Can I get away from that? Does it blow up or something? Does it explode?
[4605.10s -> 4615.93s]  What's that? What's that? Throw it back. Yep. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.
[4640.09s -> 4650.30s]  Omega well, tuber voice. What? Am I doing a tuber voice? When? When did I do a tuber voice?
[4651.26s -> 4674.31s]  This guy's fucking dead. No, he is. Oh shit. He's going to come back up.
[4676.26s -> 4679.46s]  Wisen fucking sucks laughing my ass off. No, he doesn't. It's not over.
[4682.10s -> 4696.41s]  All right. I didn't think he was going to be this huge. Jesus. Okay.
[4709.78s -> 4712.02s]  I feel like it should be a lot deeper and a lot more echo.
[4717.46s -> 4719.78s]  His voice should be a little deeper.
[4726.89s -> 4740.38s]  Press B again. Do I have time to go, go let Otto in here?
[4740.38s -> 4743.90s]  Otto wants to come in here. I don't think I have enough time. Hold on. Let me pause the game.
[4748.10s -> 4752.09s]  Otto wants to come in and hang out.
[4756.17s -> 4763.94s]  And then on the next episode, they replay the last five minutes that just happened
[4763.94s -> 4869.96s]  until we get to that point again. All right. I'll be right back. All right.
[4872.12s -> 4889.05s]  This is going to introduce Terma to Jojo. Jojo's Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. New video episode four.
[4889.05s -> 4896.10s]  Old friends, new enemies. I feel like it's not long enough to have it be an episode.
[4899.54s -> 4909.19s]  Each episode is four and a half minutes. Jo, Otto, I can't. I cannot. I do not have any clothes on.
[4910.66s -> 4913.30s]  I have no clothing on. I can't turn the webcam on today. I'm sorry.
[4914.10s -> 4922.58s]  All right. Here we go. Uh, it seems Asura has returned to this world. You don't say.
[4923.54s -> 4927.62s]  Apostress, that's impossible. Nothing is impossible. It actually sounds like fun.
[4928.50s -> 4934.63s]  Oh, fuck. Redeem a wink.
[4937.21s -> 4939.69s]  I, all right. I, I'm going to have to put on clothes.
[4940.73s -> 4948.46s]  Nobody redeemed a wink. No, they did not. Oh, hold on. This is bad. I gotta,
[4948.46s -> 4950.94s]  do I really have to go? Oh, did somebody actually do that?
[4952.46s -> 4961.94s]  No, they didn't. I'm looking right now. I don't see anything. Yeah, they fucking, it's fake.
[4961.94s -> 4966.10s]  Let's say they faked it. I haven't done anything to see it. No, they did not. There's no wink.
[4967.37s -> 4976.18s]  They didn't. Oh my fucking God. What, what do I have? What do I do? I don't know what to do about
[4976.18s -> 5102.74s]  this. I'm, I can't turn away. I have to go put on a shirt. Fucking God damn it. I need to make sure
[5102.74s -> 5132.10s]  this is. You see it? This is the fucking thing you plugged in. Right one. God. Ah, my black
[5132.10s -> 5158.95s]  key is not even plugged in. Wait. Get some USB slots. No, my motherboard sucks and it's fucked
[5158.95s -> 5168.79s]  up and I have to get a new computer. Okay. All right. Here you go. You ready? Motherfuckers.
[5168.79s -> 5194.39s]  I got a haircut too. There you go. That's the only thing I have. What do you wear? This is,
[5194.39s -> 5198.47s]  this is like a suit, a suit top. I don't have anything clean right now.
[5203.64s -> 5207.88s]  I just did it. You look nervous because I don't have to. Okay. I'm going to keep this on
[5208.44s -> 5217.27s]  just in case something happens. I got to like button it up. Professional streamer.
[5218.55s -> 5223.19s]  What is this link? All right. I'm trying to watch my favorite animated television show. Okay.
[5223.75s -> 5233.32s]  What does fucking naked mean? What? What? What? What? I know. Yes. Yeah. I don't,
[5233.32s -> 5238.76s]  it doesn't matter. It's fine. Uh, I know. I'm not showing this on stream, but that's fine.
[5239.64s -> 5246.12s]  Here we go. I'm going back to the game. Yeah. I know my audio wasn't synced
[5246.84s -> 5258.46s]  because I'm playing an Xbox game. Joe Otto. No, I can't. Is nothing but a speck of dust
[5258.46s -> 5263.18s]  of the past. Indeed. Our power was nothing compared to what we are capable of now.
[5265.53s -> 5271.29s]  Joe Otto. I cannot sh- Okay. I'm going to be completely and totally transparent with you guys.
[5271.93s -> 5277.77s]  The reason why I can't show Otto is for very specifically. I don't have a shirt on. I have
[5277.77s -> 5285.78s]  a suit fucking jacket on and I have a pair of shorts on that. That's it. I can't, I cannot
[5285.78s -> 5298.86s]  do webcam right now. So I can't do that. I'm not prepared for this. Put on a shirt. I don't have,
[5298.86s -> 5308.79s]  I don't have any shirts. They're all being in the laundry room. This is bullshit. No,
[5308.79s -> 5312.55s]  I can't even prove this because I'll get banned. No. Well, all right. All right. That's it. That's
[5313.03s -> 5316.15s]  it. Who cares? I'm just going to play the game. That's what you're here for, right?
[5316.95s -> 5322.63s]  No, no, no. This game sucks. I don't like this game. Where is this ultimate Shrek Hulk game?
[5323.19s -> 5329.66s]  Okay. I think there was a time when we had to actually exert effort to purify one large goma.
[5330.22s -> 5336.14s]  Oh, how pitiful we all once were. How shall we proceed, my lord? If it pleases you,
[5336.14s -> 5342.57s]  I can depart immediately to purify him. I've already sent Weizen. Let him take care of our
[5342.57s -> 5346.81s]  old friend. I already beat Weizen. That's if you don't know. I can imagine the look on
[5346.81s -> 5350.17s]  Asura's face now. He hasn't the slightest idea how powerless he is right now.
[5351.53s -> 5356.97s]  We like Fortnite. Well, good. I'm glad you do. You'll never see that channel on this. You'll
[5356.97s -> 5360.01s]  never see that channel. You'll never see that game on this channel. Whatever.
[5363.03s -> 5368.55s]  I think you'd be surprised to explain. There are no guarantees in battle. Nothing is impossible.
[5368.55s -> 5387.32s]  Ha ha ha ha ha. We like Fortnite. Play it, old man. You play it. You have 11,000 subscriptions
[5387.32s -> 5397.93s]  and can't afford a shirt. What? You want me to go buy a bunch of fucking expensive shirts?
[5399.11s -> 5408.55s]  Why? Go buy a bunch of expensive shirts. No. What? Why would I do that? I have like eight Star
[5408.55s -> 5416.42s]  Wars shirts and like two blazers and two and like four shorts. They're fine. And I have like a
[5416.42s -> 5424.92s]  couple of nice shirts. I have some nice jeans. You want to go spend like 600 bucks on like a nice
[5424.92s -> 5430.68s]  button up that I'll wear once a year? No, I can wear my 12 dollar Star Wars shirts every day and
[5430.68s -> 5448.01s]  not have to spend a thousand dollars. All right, here we go. Do I have to hold up? Oh, this is
[5448.73s -> 5455.37s]  use left stick to drag the reticle over enemies to lock on press wide release all the blasts
[5455.37s -> 5465.99s]  at once. The more lock-ons you have, the more powerful the blast will be. Is that it? I actually
[5465.99s -> 5480.06s]  like this game. It's fun. Just go. It's easy. I was reading chat. Sorry, not going to get a perfect
[5480.06s -> 5499.70s]  now. You can fail. This is just shadow of the Colossus, but far less buttons. All right. I'm
[5499.70s -> 5536.66s]  getting hit. All right. Yeah, I'm getting hit. Nick Donald's of the Colossus. Oh, dude. The
[5536.66s -> 5540.34s]  best part about that is I was a little too deep down in the dirt and he didn't even,
[5541.22s -> 5553.54s]  he didn't depress it down any further. So I was fine. I was too deep down in the rock. This was
[5553.54s -> 5584.41s]  loud. She suffers and to bring about like a shitty DJ, get like four buttons to the DJ pauses
[5584.41s -> 5595.82s]  all the music that does that. And then turns the music back on where it left off six arm.
[5596.62s -> 5617.21s]  Oh, I can actually hit. Wait. Oh, he's attacking. Okay. I thought he was wicked far away. I thought
[5617.21s -> 5641.62s]  he was like a thousand meters away. I thought that was him. Go super damage. I'm not going to
[5641.62s -> 5671.96s]  chat right now. Let's wait and do this. I throw it back. There we go. There we go. Throw it back.
[5674.25s -> 5684.94s]  First, we demand attention. Streamer goes on coke and loses all clothes.
[5685.42s -> 5717.98s]  This still exists. Can we end this? Oh, I thought I was, I jumped. Oh my God. Oh, fuck. I'm going to
[5717.98s -> 5740.44s]  die. Okay. I can't, I can't get hit anymore. How do I dodge this shit? I'm dead. I got disconnected
[5740.44s -> 5760.31s]  from Xbox. Why? What the hell did I do? Throw it back. Throw it back.
[5773.37s -> 5786.60s]  All right. First. So burst is just go into a cut scene and continue. Spin it around.
[5787.16s -> 5807.46s]  Come on by his fingers. Throw. Here we go. Ooh, that was quick. That was weird. That slowed down.
[5808.18s -> 5838.81s]  Okay. We're good. I can't hit it that fast. It's not registering when I do it too fast. See,
[5840.44s -> 5843.72s]  I'm pressing it a million miles per hour. You guys know how far I can do that.
[5844.52s -> 5861.85s]  It doesn't know. It doesn't register some of them. Please explode. Explode. I got this laser on.
[5861.85s -> 5880.70s]  This thing is so hot. I was waiting for him to do a big breathe in like, and you think you can beat
[5880.70s -> 5885.50s]  a god? And that asteroid like sucks into his throat. That's probably what would happen.
[5890.94s -> 5907.40s]  That, I mean think about how powerful that breath is. You have a phase three. It's even bigger.
[5914.12s -> 5936.79s]  I am an absolute unit. Hey, we'll see you on the next episode. He never stops growing.
[5938.41s -> 5942.94s]  What do you, what do I do about this now? The guy's as big as the three or four planets.
[5948.22s -> 5962.86s]  Gongenweisen. Holy shit. He set up like a pull shot.
[5969.91s -> 5975.59s]  Oh, that's a pretty big finger. That big, that finger is the size of like New Hampshire. We've
[5975.59s -> 5996.94s]  got to be careful. Stop. Stop. Let's go. Oh God. And it's hot too.
[6012.12s -> 6016.44s]  Holy shit. All right. This game just increased the full letter grade.
[6030.74s -> 6037.86s]  It wasn't me. I have decided to save. Nice bit rate. Great rebirth. Why do I have,
[6037.86s -> 6067.22s]  why is my memory in like 1200 up? Bro, come on. I can do it faster, but it won't register a lot
[6067.22s -> 6097.67s]  of them if I do it too fast. I'm doing it so fast. What? Oh my God. Which way, which way do I go?
[6098.39s -> 6140.15s]  I was going the other way. Oh, the sad part is we lost the entire Western hemisphere because of
[6140.15s -> 6160.55s]  that. Hey, look, there's your cool explosion. Did I just destroy earth? Why are you here?
[6161.59s -> 6169.66s]  Is this a spider? Do you even know what you want? You have already failed once at living.
[6175.62s -> 6185.93s]  You are a fool. Next time. Do not come back. Who is going to repair my auto mail?
[6196.14s -> 6207.91s]  Total rank C. Oh, sorry. I got a B. Sixth armed Azra Asura.
[6211.29s -> 6222.65s]  Concept art. New video. New achievements. Cool. Next episode. Let's go.
[6223.61s -> 6237.96s]  Robin Atkin Downs. Yeah, he is in this game. Episode five. Hello, victory. Impossible. How
[6237.96s -> 6244.31s]  could Wyzen have lost to him? He has brought shame to the seven deities. In all honesty,
[6244.31s -> 6250.71s]  I'm not surprised Wyzen was the weakest among us after all. He lost the moment he believed that
[6250.71s -> 6257.99s]  size equals strength. So we're going to have to do the thing that Asura did to him. We just have
[6257.99s -> 6264.74s]  to shrink to like one thousandth his size. There's going to be like a tiny ant boss, right? I would
[6264.74s -> 6276.04s]  assume. In any case, the real problem is the fact that fat idiot wasted a significant amount of the
[6276.04s -> 6283.66s]  mantra, an amount that took us so long to accumulate. That fool. Our cause will not waver because of
[6283.66s -> 6297.27s]  something as trivial as this. Who cares about the cause? I'll kill him for fun. Not so fast. A large
[6297.35s -> 6301.03s]  coma has appeared on the surface with Wyzen gone. I need someone to handle it.
[6302.39s -> 6305.59s]  And have someone handle it. I only follow what my blade thirsts for.
[6306.55s -> 6310.65s]  Everybody in the room, their eyes just all rolled to the back of their fucking head.
[6314.36s -> 6319.80s]  Oops. While you two were arguing, Yasha went after Asura himself. He, he, he.
[6322.57s -> 6337.32s]  That could be fun to watch. After the defeat of war. No. We're just going to get boss, boss, boss,
[6337.32s -> 6340.68s]  boss, boss. End of the game. That's so funny. They're all just going to come one by one and die.
[6341.72s -> 6355.02s]  In extravagant fashion. This one's got to take a few steps and like walk into a sign.
[6355.58s -> 6371.59s]  Next time. His head just rocks back. Just like, ba-boom. It hits him like in the mouth a little
[6371.59s -> 6375.19s]  bit too. It's like really bad. You know when somebody like really actually walks into something
[6375.19s -> 6384.10s]  and it fucks them up. Like they hit someone like the face, the mouth. What? Asura, why have you come
[6384.10s -> 6391.42s]  back? Okay. This is my brother. We were, we were, we were at a mall. Hold on. This is like funny.
[6391.42s -> 6396.46s]  We were at a mall and we were, I don't know why I'm thinking about this right now,
[6397.26s -> 6403.64s]  but we were walking together and I don't know what happened, but there was a sign,
[6404.68s -> 6408.68s]  you know, like in the mall, those signs that the little stand up signs with, it's like a
[6409.48s -> 6413.40s]  rectangle that's in this little metal frame and it's just on a single stand.
[6414.36s -> 6420.92s]  Do you guys know what I'm talking about while they have those? It's just a single stand sign
[6420.92s -> 6427.88s]  that's up at about like four or five feet tall. All right. So we're walking around and there was
[6427.88s -> 6435.50s]  a poster for a Goldie Hawn movie. Goldie Hawn movie. I don't know which one it was. And it was,
[6435.50s -> 6440.22s]  it was like, Goldie Hawn was in the middle and there was other two other people next to her.
[6441.02s -> 6445.74s]  And she was like just sitting there and he was like, hey, look, we should go see that movie.
[6445.74s -> 6449.18s]  And he was just making like a joke, let's go see that movie. But he wasn't paying attention
[6449.18s -> 6458.46s]  in front of him. He just, boom, like rocked into this sign. It was fucking crazy. I have this
[6458.46s -> 6470.14s]  memory burned in my brain forever. It was like, it was just, I haven't thought about this in like
[6470.14s -> 6476.60s]  25 years, but he was pointing and going, hey, let's go see that movie. And then right when
[6476.60s -> 6481.64s]  he got to the V in movie, he just like, his head just rocked. He was fine. The thing didn't weigh
[6481.64s -> 6491.22s]  that much. It was just kind of, it was just, it was just like ridiculous. Oh, it's not like a joke
[6491.22s -> 6495.78s]  or anything. Like it was just, I have that burned into my brain forever. And I'm like seeing it
[6495.78s -> 6502.86s]  again. He failed the QTE. No, he didn't fail the QTE. He was reading chat and wasn't paying
[6502.86s -> 6513.43s]  attention. That's a silent film joke. No, I'm just, now I keep seeing it. It was like a cartoon.
[6513.43s -> 6519.64s]  All right. I'm not going to pay attention. I don't have any arms.
[6527.13s -> 6538.33s]  Avenge your wife's death. I can't even fight this guy. It is pointless to resist.
[6538.97s -> 6546.57s]  She's the Travis voice. Am I supposed to lose? Just dodge? This guy just sounded fair.
[6553.61s -> 6558.57s]  Fuckhead. Stop making me laugh. I keep seeing my brother walk into the sign.
[6559.53s -> 6566.58s]  Avenge your wife's death. Take back your daughter.
[6571.43s -> 6574.95s]  Watch it. All right, he's got to dodge. I just think he's walking off.
[6581.40s -> 6586.71s]  Dodge and then go at him. I'm going to fucking attack him.
[6590.41s -> 6608.26s]  Wait, should I dive kick him? I'm going to dive kick him. That's worse. Wait, I can do that.
[6608.26s -> 6621.32s]  Avenge your wife's death. Take back your daughter. You got a big Buddha.
[6622.47s -> 6630.14s]  It is pointless 12,000 years ago. That was your fate. Leave it at that.
[6631.82s -> 6653.93s]  Thanks for you in this world. What? I can't do it. All right, almost good. I got it. I got it.
[6654.73s -> 6656.58s]  Do I dodge?
[6665.38s -> 6703.11s]  Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Oh, there it is. Get out of here. Did I miss? You can miss.
[6707.27s -> 6710.63s]  You can miss that. I thought it was just press RT and watch a movie.
[6711.67s -> 6756.65s]  What do you mean it was two? No, it wasn't. Let's go. I get it. I got it now. I got it. I got it.
[6761.18s -> 6771.91s]  Avenge your wife's death. Take back your daughter. Come on. Do the swing. Two swings.
[6775.67s -> 6790.65s]  Nice. Good combo. It's pre-recorded. No, it's not. Stop saying that. Don't say that.
[6807.27s -> 6809.43s]  Yes, I am. I used to be one of you. Wasn't I like number eight?
[6810.23s -> 6830.97s]  Oh, shit. All right, here we go.
[6833.05s -> 6859.99s]  Burst. Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh, shit. I got it. I think I missed.
[6860.15s -> 6872.22s]  Look at you. You cannot hide. Oh, then I won't be able to see.
[6884.47s -> 6904.20s]  Whoa. I mean, that's a pretty, that's pretty, come on. That's like a, that's a boss move.
[6905.40s -> 6911.75s]  I'm not even worth avoiding because they don't hurt you. Damn. Oh, boy.
[6911.75s -> 6943.74s]  Oh, fuck. Did I get it? Pretty sick T-pose. Oh, no. I got to be careful.
[6946.49s -> 6976.65s]  Run. I can avoid that. Oh, fuck. What's he doing? Run. Quick hit him with a visceral attack.
[6977.29s -> 6984.66s]  Oh, I got greedy.
[6995.32s -> 7007.96s]  Can I fire? Oh, what's happening? Yeah, I keep trying to do it, but I can't. I'm not getting it
[7007.96s -> 7048.39s]  right. All right. Don't fuck this up. No. Sorry. I got it. Shit. Please don't. All right. Don't use
[7048.39s -> 7075.74s]  it. Not yet. It's not a, no choke. Here we go. I said, all right, hopefully this guy didn't
[7075.74s -> 7085.29s]  raise to be 5,000 times the size. There is nothing you can do as priestess. Mithra has
[7085.29s -> 7091.91s]  dedicated herself to the salvation of our world. You should be proud. What did you say?
[7091.91s -> 7105.61s]  Hey, be proud. Oh, he's making me angry. He's devoted to the cause in order to save the world.
[7105.61s -> 7116.57s]  I'm going to say the thing that makes you angry again. You motherfucker.
[7117.93s -> 7150.86s]  Boy. Lava. Did I put it on? Can I just like worm my body over there and slide it on my face? Does
[7150.86s -> 7155.24s]  it do anything to me? Is it like putting the mask on in the Jim Carrey movie?
[7168.55s -> 7180.62s]  As is your temper, but he's ugly before the cause.
[7190.82s -> 7200.73s]  He did the, am I cut in half? Do not return again.
[7201.69s -> 7211.34s]  Still getting credits for this game. I think I know who wrote the game by now.
[7211.98s -> 7226.73s]  Witness the salvation of the world from the depths of Naraka.
[7232.52s -> 7243.75s]  Bad ending. Yeah. I mean, I could say that thing that everybody says, but
[7260.25s -> 7285.11s]  does this turn into kingdom hearts? Where's the goofy? Where's Donald Duck? Where's Mickey?
[7289.21s -> 7308.28s]  Presented by Capcom. Coming up next on the next episode of Asura's Wrath. That was part one.
[7309.24s -> 7338.78s]  Part one is its own season of TV. What's going to happen is it's going to open up the next one and
[7338.78s -> 7349.75s]  it's going to be like, I'm going to start slow and you're going to hear, oh, you're kidding me.
[7353.54s -> 7362.57s]  We're going to get a full recap of what happened in the first part of part two. We're talking like
[7363.37s -> 7374.18s]  potentially 10 hours of gameplay shown in about four minutes. And they do that in kingdom hearts
[7374.18s -> 7379.99s]  too. They, they like showed, they just like skipped the whole portion of the game, right?
[7386.46s -> 7400.92s]  Clip that one. Why? Is that bad? I mean, probably. We're singing 2020. Don't bookmark it then.
[7407.29s -> 7410.57s]  All right. This will be the second time we've taken your father from you. Won't it?
[7412.39s -> 7417.88s]  When is the half life stream? I've never said I was going to play half. All right.
[7417.88s -> 7424.90s]  Why do you put words in my mouth? I said, I wasn't going to play halfway. I was.
[7426.23s -> 7431.54s]  What your most used dance on playing halfway. I don't think I'm going to play. I'm not going
[7431.54s -> 7443.13s]  to be playing half life on this stream. Hey, so when's half life? I, this will be the second
[7443.13s -> 7448.90s]  time we've taken your father from you. Won't it be? He didn't even know what a Lambda was.
[7450.02s -> 7454.52s]  When this is all over, you'll have the right to take my life and I will accept death. Gladly.
[7454.52s -> 7462.36s]  It's going to be tomorrow. No, it's not. I guess I've played half life like six times.
[7462.36s -> 7468.86s]  I'm not playing half life. No, I don't want to play half life. I'm not playing half life
[7468.86s -> 7474.14s]  too. It makes me want to puke. It makes the boat level makes me sick. It's a really good game.
[7474.70s -> 7492.95s]  But for now, you will have to wait. Just watch this episode with me. It's the only way we need
[7492.95s -> 7499.59s]  your power. The world needs it. Alitra is constantly unleashing Goma upon the world.
[7499.59s -> 7502.87s]  If we do not have mantra to fight against them, there is no hope for civilization.
[7503.59s -> 7512.18s]  Your power to amplify mantra is our sword and shield. We cannot bring salvation to Gaia
[7512.74s -> 7519.29s]  without you. Half life, half life, half life, half life. Let's go. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[7522.98s -> 7529.75s]  Sura, why do you choose not to listen to reason? Mithra's power is essential to the cause. Once we
[7529.75s -> 7545.96s]  defeat the Alitra, Mithra and the world will be saved. Stubborn fool. 500 years later, 12,000.
[7545.96s -> 7563.66s]  1000. It's a long time. Part two. Rebirth. Stubborn fool won't play half life.
[7565.66s -> 7570.90s]  God damn it. Wait, we did this? We're doing this again?
[7580.86s -> 7595.69s]  We meet again. You are a demigod just as they are, you know. If you can accept their actions,
[7596.57s -> 7602.04s]  perhaps you should let go and allow your soul to become one with Gaia again.
[7603.00s -> 7608.26s]  Hey, can you, can you, can you bite me? Do you choose to move forward?
[7608.26s -> 7610.90s]  I feel like that would be beneficial to me. Just bite me right in the neck.
[7610.90s -> 7618.18s]  This is exactly why your soul will never belong to the Goma nor the seven deities.
[7619.22s -> 7624.33s]  There is a great power hidden in you. No, not even Spider-Man. Just, I feel like this thing's
[7624.33s -> 7627.77s]  powerful. Just like, bite me. And like, inject venom into my bloodstream.
[7649.26s -> 7654.84s]  Remember. If we're two hours into the game and I get another
[7655.56s -> 7662.52s]  part two tutorial, it's gonna be tutorial two. They're gonna introduce a mechanic or something.
[7666.89s -> 7707.85s]  Or maybe not. What's the point of this? Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. This is the beginning.
[7721.43s -> 7745.00s]  It's elephant fall. This should be fun. What happened to the first hour?
[7747.03s -> 7752.31s]  I got framed for something I didn't do and then they made lore based around how bad of a person
[7752.31s -> 7758.79s]  I was and how evil I was. Those people have since taken over the world and now I need to
[7758.79s -> 7763.67s]  come back and take it over and tell everybody that they're bad people, I think. I don't know.
[7764.39s -> 7776.73s]  I think there's a telegraph system.
[7781.43s -> 7792.17s]  Merrick, Merrick, Merrick, Merrick, Merrick. Got it. Why am I fighting the elephant? Oh, why not?
[7798.84s -> 7821.40s]  Which leg? What? Yeah, this is some entity. This is an entity. These are entities.
[7821.40s -> 7826.36s]  They're called gomas. They're apparently, I don't know, evil or something or they're part of the
[7826.36s -> 7831.56s]  world, the inside the world, inside the crust, to the earth's crust, the core. There's like lava
[7831.56s -> 7843.29s]  enemies and I don't know. We'll find out. They're demons. Yeah, the demons that live inside the
[7843.29s -> 7846.25s]  planet or something and we're trying to stop them from coming out and killing everybody.
[7847.69s -> 7864.50s]  How am I gonna get hit by that? I'm so pissed off about that one. Let's end this.
[7865.38s -> 7880.60s]  This time, shoot it. Wait, you mean shoot it? Can I just shoot it? Oh, what a good idea that is.
[7881.40s -> 7900.74s]  No, look, I can't shoot it anymore. No, it's it. Here we go. Let's do the worst. One tusk down.
[7909.06s -> 7935.18s]  All right, now what? Part two. What's that? Holy shit. Okay, well, that happens very quickly.
[7935.98s -> 7948.04s]  It goes up and then, okay, here it comes. It goes up and then, no,
[7950.30s -> 7957.10s]  it does it two times in a row. Oh, fuck. Oh, my God. I don't know the timing on it. I'm gonna die.
[7960.34s -> 7977.46s]  Oh, damn it. I think it doesn't. This one's easy to avoid.
[7978.26s -> 7983.58s]  Can you just pick a side and just get away from that side? Oh, my fucking God. Yeah,
[7983.58s -> 7985.58s]  you just have to get away from the side that it's on.
[8003.59s -> 8018.06s]  All right, that's not building. That doesn't build any pressure. What the hell am I trying to do?
[8019.02s -> 8026.54s]  What's that? Oh, God. What the fuck? Oh, it's a dodge through it.
[8032.28s -> 8039.14s]  This game had an anime, did it? I just lost 50% of my HP.
[8040.10s -> 8043.22s]  This is what happens when you read a chat room when you're supposed to be playing a game.
[8044.18s -> 8047.78s]  God damn it. What am I streaming right now?
[8066.76s -> 8096.42s]  Oh, my God. I'm gonna die again. Come here. Does this do extra damage? No.
[8097.30s -> 8104.98s]  Press LT. Yeah, I can't like hit him or anything. Do you want me just to punch him? No, I mean,
[8104.98s -> 8124.18s]  I can't. Where's he going? Oh, my fucking God. Jump? It's hard to tell which side he's gonna pick.
[8124.82s -> 8145.85s]  Oh, God. Here we go. He's gonna do the stupid beam. Do it twice? Stay in the middle?
[8152.46s -> 8156.63s]  I can't get hit. I can't get hit. I can't get hit. I can't get hit. I can't get hit. I can't get hit.
[8156.63s -> 8159.43s]  Don't get hit. Don't get hit. Don't get hit. Don't get hit. Don't get hit. Don't get hit. How long is
[8159.43s -> 8173.10s]  it gonna be for? How long are you gonna do this for? What's this? New move? All right, come on.
[8173.74s -> 8211.62s]  Just don't get hit. Stop. I'm fine. Which side is he gonna do? I don't know.
[8214.20s -> 8231.34s]  What's this? Oh, come on. Shoot him? I can't. I can't. Come on. All right, dash. Dash at me.
[8249.13s -> 8260.12s]  Burst. What the fuck just happened? Oh, yeah, this cut. It's too nerve-wracking.
[8261.00s -> 8272.65s]  Forgot they were QTEs. No, I didn't forget. I just wanted to see what you guys were saying.
[8274.57s -> 8279.22s]  Why do I miss those? Because I look to the left and there's a chat room over here.
[8280.97s -> 8284.25s]  And I go, what did somebody say? Whoops. Missed the QTE.
[8285.21s -> 8314.55s]  Control yourself. Where did this guy even come from? Immersing oneself in battle like that.
[8315.67s -> 8324.52s]  Well done, Asura. Now that you have something to protect, why are you so full of rage?
[8325.16s -> 8335.35s]  Perhaps. Just a massive hand. That is exactly why. Something to protect? Nonsense.
[8336.31s -> 8343.67s]  The only reason one needs to fight is the fight itself. That is so like you, master.
[8343.67s -> 8349.51s]  They all have big hands. We have cleared this area of Goma. Let us return to Shinkoku.
[8350.55s -> 8365.30s]  Right. Oh, why are they all elephants? Is there something in the lore as to why they're elephants?
[8384.57s -> 8395.02s]  Your father has returned. Welcome home, dear. Thanks. Giant enemy baby.
[8395.10s -> 8410.34s]  So that is what he must protect? Yes, though you may not understand why.
[8418.39s -> 8429.05s]  Easy. Whoa. I'm sorry, I'm just so angry. Please take it. Oh, and he just turns around and just
[8429.05s -> 8471.46s]  fucking punches a wall. Brother. Looks scared of her. Then he should pacify her. Him? That's
[8471.78s -> 8502.06s]  an abrupt cut. Not bad, Asura. That uncontrollable rage of yours suits you well. See what I mean?
[8504.10s -> 8507.06s]  And I didn't do anything. You just told everybody to move.
[8508.98s -> 8517.22s]  And I said move, but they didn't. Asura, join us. Should we work together? We could more effectively
[8517.22s -> 8524.86s]  exterminate the Goma. Test me. You are aware of Mithra is the only suitable vessel to become
[8524.86s -> 8543.69s]  priestess. Praise her with care. Incompetent as you may be. Well, now I know. You certainly are
[8543.69s -> 8553.22s]  incompetent. I wager that is one of your more charming features. At least we know now the
[8553.22s -> 8564.49s]  source of the flame that burns in your soul. In other words, you... Stop. What was that?
[8564.49s -> 8579.40s]  I can't kill the spider. Hey, Lois, remember that time I fought the Goma?
[8584.30s -> 8599.30s]  What do you mean? That was kind of funny. Hey, Lois. Minus two family guy jokes. No,
[8599.30s -> 8604.50s]  come on. That's like kind of funny. That's kind of funny. That's kind of funny. You got it.
[8604.58s -> 8608.65s]  That was humorous.
[8633.61s -> 8637.69s]  I just grab the end of his web and like slurp and like suck it up like spaghetti.
[8638.81s -> 8652.94s]  Every time we're down here, I talk about killing this thing. I don't know why.
[8653.34s -> 8717.43s]  That's kind of fucked up. You were in the lava. Yeah. I mean, you can just leave me like that.
[8729.40s -> 8741.30s]  Father's duty, episode seven. Is that part of the elephant or what? Yeah, maybe it was.
[8742.98s -> 8749.10s]  Here we go.
[8749.10s -> 8755.54s]  We continued Omega Lo. Omega Lo.
[8762.90s -> 8768.66s]  Usher is residents thousands of years earlier. Seems that you made quite an impression in the
[8768.66s -> 8775.78s]  last battle. Is that so? Pithra was praying for you the whole time. You hear my prayers, father?
[8776.50s -> 8779.62s]  I did. I felt your presence with me and thought of you the whole time.
[8780.58s -> 8786.50s]  So you didn't think about me at all? Hmm. No, I meant, oh, father, hee hee hee.
[8787.22s -> 8799.67s]  General Osura, the next priestess has been chosen. What? General Osura's daughter Mithra is to be
[8799.67s -> 8816.49s]  priestess. Congratulations, General. I can do better than that. I will not allow it. Father,
[8816.49s -> 8822.70s]  but why? I will not have you become a tool for war. If it will give me the power to protect you,
[8822.70s -> 8829.98s]  I will gladly become priestess. But Pithra is gifted with the power to save the world.
[8829.98s -> 8836.58s]  She could be the key in eradicating the Goma. Shut up. Osura, wait. Where are you going?
[8839.48s -> 8863.27s]  Can't see that. Can't have that be spoiled. Animation and touch up. Cyber Connect 2.
[8865.78s -> 8869.46s]  I just want to see Cyber Connect 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 to all different episodes.
[8870.34s -> 8889.82s]  No, I can do it too. You know I can. You know I can do that exact thing that's happening right
[8889.82s -> 8904.23s]  now. You know it. I know I can do it. You know I can. You know I'm capable of it. I'm having,
[8905.11s -> 8923.70s]  I am using a lot of control right now to not do that. I want to do it so bad. If it was me alone,
[8923.70s -> 8929.54s]  I'd be doing it over and over again for the next hour. If I wasn't on stream, I would seriously be
[8929.54s -> 8936.42s]  sitting here just going, and it would do it for an hour. And then Kim would come in here and be
[8936.42s -> 8962.02s]  like, what the fuck are you doing? His arms are back. Oh, don't be such a baby. Oh, I'm a squirrel
[8962.02s -> 8981.86s]  back. No, they don't. That's one of my favorite lines from any video game cut scene. It's delivered
[8981.86s -> 9028.95s]  so perfectly. Wait, what? Oh, now look what you did. Now you woke up the baby. And how long it
[9028.95s -> 9053.88s]  took. You know how long it took to get them to go to sleep. Wait, wait. All right, bye.
[9054.60s -> 9061.66s]  Is that supposed to be a laugh? I think that was a laugh.
[9064.44s -> 9071.93s]  Oh, we have forward progress in this level. This is an arena.
[9074.22s -> 9097.91s]  There's somebody behind me too. Get, get. This is the Sonic Unleashed Werewolf levels.
[9098.87s -> 9110.38s]  God damn it. Why did you have to say that? That is so accurate. Why did you have to
[9110.38s -> 9134.26s]  ruin this whole game for me? Don't hit the baby. Watch out. Watch out for the Mario.
[9159.85s -> 9190.50s]  Get up quick. I know a lot of you thought I was going to fail that on purpose to see what happens,
[9190.58s -> 9192.50s]  but no, I want the good grade.
[9209.32s -> 9235.80s]  Jesus. Goma Squasher. Hey, you go first. He's like a turtle. Here we go. Goma Squasher.
[9237.24s -> 9251.34s]  Uh, does it run? Kind of. Pistols? Yeah. Can I fire? Can I shoot? In the head? Yep.
[9252.22s -> 9261.06s]  Oh, it's uh, Contra. Contra for the Super Nintendo. Contra for the Super Nintendo.
[9261.06s -> 9264.02s]  The turtle, when you hit the head and the head goes like quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
[9264.02s -> 9277.14s]  quack, quack, quack. Holy shit, it's the same thing. Yep. We're working as a bunch of them.
[9277.14s -> 9285.03s]  The stomach? All right. Yeah. Turn into the stomach.
[9287.83s -> 9307.70s]  Back it up. Oh, that was probably exceptionally painful. Oh, does it keep going around? No,
[9307.70s -> 9328.95s]  we're good. Right in the head. Out, out, out. I don't know what that means. What's that? Adds?
[9328.95s -> 9351.80s]  Yep. I just summoned him, man. Just summoned him. Charge. Let's kill your own friends.
[9352.76s -> 9380.01s]  Oh, fuck. Take his ass. Sorry, he's doing spin. No, he just double tapped. Don't triple tap me.
[9380.81s -> 9401.18s]  All right, I'm good. What are you gonna do? Charge? Nope. All right. Settle down.
[9404.17s -> 9431.18s]  LT is immunity? Is it really? Can you do a tail whip? Oh my fucking god. Oh my god. Oh my god.
[9431.18s -> 9436.71s]  Oh my god. What the fuck happened? What have I done? I almost got instantly killed.
[9437.67s -> 9442.63s]  This. Wish I knew that. I'm scared of doing anything.
[9450.28s -> 9480.54s]  Oh, tap, tap, tap, tap. Oh my god, my nose is so itchy.
[9488.71s -> 9519.56s]  Do a charge. The frames. Yeah, they're not very, they're not very good, are they?
[9519.56s -> 9533.69s]  The console, this is on Xbox 360.
[9549.98s -> 9551.34s]  But what language are they speaking?
[9551.34s -> 9563.99s]  Stop praying. This is pathetic.
[9564.47s -> 9574.14s]  English? Septentrion.
[9604.89s -> 9610.41s]  So this is the reason for the unusual mantra concentration in these parts.
[9610.49s -> 9625.45s]  Guys on a single wheel? Oh, okay. The magical wheel. Of course it is.
[9630.09s -> 9632.78s]  I wonder what that guy's fight's gonna be like.
[9635.88s -> 9671.56s]  Oh, it's happening right now. I don't have to wonder anymore. Boss? No? No boss?
[9672.44s -> 9695.82s]  Uh, why'd you kill that guy? What? What?
[9724.01s -> 9725.77s]  This guy's playing black and white.
[9731.59s -> 9737.93s]  That's his, that's his creature. He turns around and he's like, stop doing that!
[9738.89s -> 9750.17s]  No! Puts a leash on him. I had that, oh god damn it, I had the destruction leash on!
[9750.81s -> 9783.98s]  The hologram really. He even pointed too, he was like, point. This little baby. Rock music.
[9787.22s -> 9789.85s]  There's the fucking machine gun sound.
[9797.48s -> 9799.72s]  Some battle going on somewhere with guns.
[9811.14s -> 9820.15s]  I know what it is. There are no guns in this game, it just sounds like it.
[9821.27s -> 9831.22s]  Can you please switch to the Japanese voiceover? It's better.
[9833.37s -> 9846.28s]  He's already become invested in the characters while they speak up.
[9847.00s -> 9852.58s]  I dodged it.
[9861.35s -> 9864.76s]  Base.
[9876.76s -> 9878.84s]  Oh, I hit him with that too. Oh, what?
[9882.46s -> 9907.61s]  Oh shit. Where is he? Sonic unleashed.
[9917.69s -> 9920.57s]  Can't get over it. Why did that person have to say that?
[9921.05s -> 9926.98s]  Oh fuck, that hurt. Oh wait, there's another, there's like another mini-boss here.
[9932.46s -> 9945.42s]  Oh shit. Sorry. Oh boy. What the hell's going on? I'm invincible though.
[9960.73s -> 9981.06s]  What is it? What is he saying? What is he doing?
[9989.90s -> 9993.58s]  You go tell who's responsible for this. That I'm coming for him.
[9994.14s -> 10010.01s]  All right. Can I not do it? What if I don't want to? Can I not do it?
[10033.94s -> 10043.91s]  Now what? Uh oh. She's learning. That's not good. I'm not putting a good example out.
[10044.71s -> 10058.57s]  She's gonna rock in her hand. Holy shit. She's learning from you. You're the god.
[10059.61s -> 10079.35s]  You're the reason humans are like this. No, I'm not. Stop, stop, stop. Enough. Use two hands.
[10079.35s -> 10115.58s]  Take more leverage that way. Black and white too sure is weird. Where's the baby? Yeah, where's the
[10115.58s -> 10143.59s]  baby? You, you let me. Baby got League of Legends ganked. I don't, I kind of, I kind of know what
[10143.59s -> 10148.74s]  you mean by that, but I don't at the same time. I don't know what that means. Sort of. I don't know
[10148.74s -> 10164.26s]  what that means. I mean, I kind of do. Not really. Villager B. Episode 8, willing sacrifices. All
[10164.26s -> 10183.02s]  right. Let's go. Village on the outskirts of Shinkoku. Here within this stone lies remains
[10183.02s -> 10188.86s]  of the fallen demigod who defied the seven deities long ago. He succeeded in killing one of them,
[10188.86s -> 10192.54s]  but at the cost of his own. Following the divine battle, the remaining deities
[10193.50s -> 10198.38s]  abandoned this land declared a curse for all eternity. It is believed the fallen demigod
[10198.38s -> 10204.46s]  continues to watch over this land, but the Goma rarely appear in these parts. For this reason,
[10204.46s -> 10209.18s]  the villagers enshrined his remains and worship from afar, who do not dare approach the shrine
[10209.18s -> 10220.58s]  out of fear. There was one little girl, however, who regularly came to the shrine and offered
[10220.58s -> 10225.51s]  flowers to the fallen demigod. Long ago, when she and her father went off to a nearby village,
[10225.51s -> 10230.63s]  they were attacked by the Goma. Just when they thought their lives were over, the seven deities
[10230.63s -> 10235.27s]  came from the heavens and purified the Goma. The little girl was deeply relieved that the deities
[10235.83s -> 10246.70s]  have saved them. However, the deities did not only purify the Goma and thus many humans were
[10246.70s -> 10251.34s]  caught in the fires of their purification. The girl's father was one of those who perished,
[10252.22s -> 10257.08s]  but rather than defy the deities for their tyranny, the villagers saw it as an honor.
[10257.64s -> 10261.88s]  They rejoiced that the deities would lead their souls to heaven and gladly gave their lives.
[10263.00s -> 10267.48s]  The girl walked hopeless and full of despair until she stumbled upon the shrine of the
[10267.48s -> 10274.28s]  fallen demigod. As the old tale said, the stone had an aura of anger that the girl was not afraid.
[10275.34s -> 10279.18s]  Somewhere in the fallen demigod's face, she saw a resemblance to her late father.
[10280.06s -> 10283.58s]  Since then, the girl has been visiting the shrine to offer flowers.
[10290.82s -> 10293.38s]  Everyone did nothing but pray, but he took action.
[10295.56s -> 10298.12s]  But oh, this is not a narrator. Wait for me, I'm coming with you.
[10302.54s -> 10320.02s]  Jerma, are you the CEO of Jerma, Incorporated? No, I mean, I guess you could say like, sure,
[10320.34s -> 10326.92s]  yes, I guess. You're doing the infomercial voice. Yeah, because it's the narrator.
[10330.36s -> 10351.88s]  You, you let me handle them. Let's do the CEO. The best laid plans, episode nine.
[10361.85s -> 10392.87s]  That was pretty, that was full. God, I'm really hating skip sections. You can't skip them either.
[10392.87s -> 10425.53s]  They're getting angry. It's pretty nice to be able to get Chip and Dale to get angry.
[10426.25s -> 10445.03s]  They just had to press a button and skip the sequence. Actually not that bad. Six arms,
[10445.03s -> 10453.66s]  no? Minus two, nobody likes Kingdom Hearts. I just, I just made fun of Kingdom Hearts.
[10453.66s -> 10470.65s]  Roger, all ships commence exorcism. I like Kingdom Hearts one and two a little,
[10470.65s -> 10502.58s]  I guess. I like Kingdom Hearts one. I don't really remember to. I'm in the ship. Let's go.
[10503.38s -> 10510.47s]  I'm not the one who started this fire. It's always burning as the world's been turned.
[10510.47s -> 10514.73s]  Now, but it will burn you to ash. It's pretty much the same thing I said.
[10514.73s -> 10517.61s]  Roger, all ships commence purification.
[10517.61s -> 10531.54s]  I have to do some firing the sky.
[10536.81s -> 10551.59s]  Oh, come on. What am I aiming at here? What am I aiming at? This, these things.
[10557.82s -> 10570.81s]  Those, these ships, these ships, everything. I'm gonna watch the right side of my screen.
[10576.25s -> 10581.11s]  Aim, forehead. No, it's yeah, you're right.
[10581.91s -> 10624.65s]  Oh, no, you cannot take the full brunt of a star. That's the worst line ever.
[10638.02s -> 10639.14s]  Only if it kills me.
[10652.47s -> 10659.74s]  That's what, oh, that's what a, that was a fun movie. Who else liked that movie? Raise your hand.
[10659.74s -> 10663.10s]  Did you like that movie? Who liked that movie?
[10663.10s -> 10673.05s]  I cannot allow fear any further. He will ruin everything.
[10673.05s -> 10674.41s]  You haven't watched it yet? What?
[10675.37s -> 10677.77s]  Roger, destroy the traitor.
[10685.59s -> 10692.15s]  Marvel fanboy. It was a good movie. It was fun. It was, it was cool.
[10693.27s -> 10698.46s]  Sometimes I forget. Don't ever like anything in 2020.
[10701.94s -> 10708.57s]  Don't like anything. Oh, what a fucking consumer.
[10708.57s -> 10739.93s]  You can't like anything. You can like anything else, just not Marvel. What movie?
[10747.98s -> 10769.43s]  What movie? Some of us don't watch movies, but superheroes are lame.
[10771.51s -> 10775.51s]  No, I knew we were going to get here eventually. I just didn't know when.
[10778.63s -> 10782.55s]  Enough people liked Marvel for it now to be, ah, stupid lame.
[10784.97s -> 10787.61s]  Enough people started to watch like Captain America had happened.
[10788.49s -> 10803.82s]  Stupid, stupid, stupid. I only drank the finest of movie wine.
[10818.63s -> 10833.70s]  Reddit has ruined everything. Oh my God. I'm instantly dead.
[10837.16s -> 10850.68s]  Oh, I didn't time it correctly. Oh shit. It starts all the way back here.
[10851.48s -> 10857.99s]  All right. That's the thing with the nature of like the internet. All right. So,
[10858.55s -> 10863.99s]  back in the day it used to be, if you had a group of maybe like eight people you ever
[10863.99s -> 10868.55s]  communicated with back like 20 years ago, you had to call somebody on a landline to like
[10869.51s -> 10874.23s]  talk to them. And no, no one was going to call your landline to be like, hey,
[10874.23s -> 10879.83s]  Marvel movies are stupid. But now, there's so many opinions.
[10881.82s -> 10886.30s]  But you didn't get random prank calls. People dialing random numbers going, hey,
[10886.30s -> 10890.73s]  by the way, Spider-Man's dumb. You'd be like, who the fuck is this?
[10913.64s -> 10922.86s]  You talk to like eight people ever. Your mom, your dad, the person who lived across the street from
[10922.86s -> 10930.18s]  you and like two people you went to school with. And if one of them didn't like Spider-Man, well,
[10931.06s -> 10941.98s]  okay. Well, yeah, like simply. Now you can, you can hear from anybody on earth,
[10941.98s -> 10949.08s]  any of their opinions instantly right now. Like right now this 5,000 people here. You guys can
[10949.08s -> 10954.68s]  give your opinions on anything. And we could just have a huge, just disgusting bubble of the world
[10954.68s -> 10960.52s]  and like movies. And half of you would hate the other half because they don't like Spider-Man.
[10961.16s -> 10991.21s]  I hate the other half. All right. I can't die here. This is important.
[10992.01s -> 10997.42s]  Come on. You're a nerd. Yeah. So what?
[11007.27s -> 11026.84s]  Come here. Come here. Come here. Kill it. Kill it. Ah, still alive. How are you still alive? Okay.
[11027.40s -> 11035.38s]  All right. Now it's just you. I don't like Spider-Man on pizza. Now neither do I.
[11039.61s -> 11047.18s]  Can I build up shit with this? Are they going to keep blocking? Oh my God. He just gave me a free
[11047.18s -> 11078.49s]  kill. Are you kidding me? Oh, come on. I'm all right. Watch out. Watch out. He's coming.
[11098.14s -> 11106.04s]  Thank God. I like this. I like this. I like this. I like this.
[11111.27s -> 11131.99s]  Cookie dough is tasty. Yeah, it is. I think that's redemption troop. Colonel
[11132.95s -> 11148.20s]  Eisen. You don't. Oh, that was quick. That was really quick. I hope it's right there. Don't be
[11148.20s -> 11158.18s]  all the way back. Thank goodness. All right. It comes quick. Laser. It's a very slow laser.
[11158.18s -> 11175.22s]  He's trying to let me win. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[11176.74s -> 11207.29s]  Oh, his name is mouth. Here comes boss. Intruder detected in the mantra chamber.
[11207.93s -> 11225.37s]  All right. Is it weird that I want to eat his hair? That's weird. All right.
[11229.61s -> 11237.83s]  Those are the mortal souls that have been harvested into mantra.
[11237.83s -> 11243.67s]  These ships, send them to heaven. You son of a bitch.
[11243.67s -> 11288.84s]  What? I knew that was going to happen. How do you like your hair? Oh, I don't.
[11288.84s -> 11301.42s]  Where did these guys come from? Where did. Oh, I don't have any. It's walking on.
[11302.38s -> 11366.84s]  Come here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Don't kill me. Come on. He's dead. He is dead. Shit.
[11368.58s -> 11380.36s]  What the fuck are these things doing? I just think it's freaking me out. I think through the
[11380.36s -> 11437.51s]  explode. Holy shit. I need to hit one person. Come on. Why? What? I can't do. Why not? Jesus.
[11447.75s -> 11468.89s]  Walk to the door. What? What do you mean walk to the door? No, I have to kill this guy.
[11473.35s -> 11480.95s]  I have a preemptive burst. Oh, now I have to use burst on door.
[11495.10s -> 11526.06s]  Throw it back. Of course it's an elevator sequence. We have to have an elevator sequence.
[11529.10s -> 11541.90s]  Elevator sequences are universal. There's no health now. There's no health in this game either.
[11541.90s -> 11618.52s]  There's a spider. Yeah. Not dead. Oh, come on. I actually just get killed in one hit there.
[11619.24s -> 11635.05s]  I thought he was dead. I have to do the whole elevator again.
[11645.82s -> 11660.82s]  Skip to the boss. Not impossible. Play the game first. Who's next? Here comes one, two,
[11660.82s -> 11665.90s]  three. Are these guys stuck in the corner?
[11669.80s -> 11693.03s]  Dead? Yep. This is where I fucked up last time. I'm ready. One, two, three, drop.
[11703.78s -> 11708.50s]  Okay. I'm going to hold the super. No, I'll just use it.
[11709.46s -> 11731.34s]  Do it again. Again? How many fucking times do I have to do this?
[11733.74s -> 11760.39s]  I have to RT this guy. Turn off the game, please. Okay, yeah, sure. But I'm done.
[11761.19s -> 11807.61s]  It's the stock alarm. All right, let's go. Are you done yet? No, not yet. Is that another hologram?
[11807.61s -> 11842.36s]  Come on. Do I have the DLC? I don't have the DLC. I didn't know I needed the DLC to beat the game.
[11846.41s -> 11857.51s]  Okay, this fight's probably going to be me ripping him out and just snap his neck.
[11859.26s -> 11862.70s]  I don't think this is going to be a big epic boss fight, guys. I think I'm just going to
[11862.78s -> 11891.13s]  break this guy's neck. Oh, I'm crushing him.
[11912.95s -> 11924.31s]  Garnet him into paste. That's the plan. Oh, I actually knew that wasn't going to be a big fight.
[11926.20s -> 11940.55s]  Yeah, I just crushed his head. Wait, am I going to be broken apart again?
[11968.06s -> 11976.87s]  Finally, a use for a shitty emote. I know who this guy is at this point. You don't have to keep
[11976.87s -> 12002.89s]  telling me. Who is this guy? August? August, yeah. August? Episode nine. In the books. D.
[12003.77s -> 12017.91s]  Hey, how do I get D on top? Because I restarted, right? But didn't somebody say there were 13
[12017.91s -> 12035.91s]  episodes? I'm almost done. Let's go. 18 episodes. Well, all right, let's fucking go. We're at number
[12035.91s -> 12037.11s]  10. Number nine.
[12069.58s -> 12076.26s]  That wasn't as cool as the first one. Now, now let's not get hasty. It's in such bad taste. I'm
[12076.26s -> 12081.06s]  sure August would be more than happy to take our little care of our problem. Fine. Where is he?
[12081.06s -> 12084.90s]  What could he be doing? All right, we're going to fight August. Where do you think he is?
[12087.86s -> 12100.55s]  This next one is really, really good. Okay. This fight is amazing. This is the best part.
[12102.15s -> 12125.05s]  Well, let's go. This next one is my favorite. Oh, well, you're setting this up here. There we go.
[12127.59s -> 12151.59s]  Words of wisdom. What? Why is he? Oh yeah, I have these arms. I forgot. It's like a baby
[12151.59s -> 12153.99s]  realizing he has fingers and hands.
[12154.55s -> 12163.26s]  Then eat good food. You fight, then drink fine wine. You fight, then sleep with beautiful women.
[12163.26s -> 12170.33s]  Hell, beautiful women. That's what it means to live. It's hobbit music.
[12176.50s -> 12182.66s]  I am not like you. It kind of was. I didn't say anything about it because it's a Lord of the
[12182.66s -> 12194.60s]  Rings reference and people might be angry at me, but it kind of does. This is rated. Where's that
[12194.60s -> 12234.34s]  box? This is T for team. We're fine. What? Why? Wait, let's go. I don't fuck around. Flash? Flash
[12234.34s -> 12255.19s]  who? That's a dick move. Okay. So look around. Well, what's he doing? Who the fuck is that? Hey.
[12256.07s -> 12270.01s]  All right. What's he doing? Hey, I'll do that too. Okay. Now what are you doing?
[12270.17s -> 12285.35s]  That's pretty good cat puke. All right. What about just regular drink?
[12285.91s -> 12304.87s]  Hell, there's a different one here. What does stand up do? To show how big I am?
[12325.02s -> 12331.02s]  All right. I filled my meter. Why splash? I don't know. That's an option.
[12332.22s -> 12357.13s]  No, I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready yet. Does it keep going? This is getting worse.
[12358.09s -> 12383.18s]  I have another. I can't even move. All right. First stand up. It's burst time.
[12388.47s -> 12405.67s]  What? This was T. This is T for team. God damn it. What? Why is he naked? This just says T on the box
[12406.31s -> 12437.13s]  and it's team. Don't be a soccer mom. I didn't do anything.
[12437.85s -> 12450.79s]  They're all to depend on. That's why weisen and cow row were so weak. Don't be a soccer mom.
[12452.31s -> 12461.16s]  They are unsatisfying. Things were different before. Yes, we used to fight side by side.
[12462.34s -> 12469.11s]  Those were the days. You remember when we did this? Let's go back and find out.
[12471.99s -> 12475.11s]  Viewers went up by about 200 or 300 viewers during that segment, by the way.
[12476.81s -> 12513.43s]  Your minds are just in the gutter. Come on. What do you mean the thumbnail? That's fine.
[12513.43s -> 12532.01s]  Thumbnail's fine. The guy looking at the moon. It's not the guy. I just looked at it. I just
[12532.01s -> 12572.30s]  looked. It's not there. It's not there. No, it's definitely not. Recommended live channels. Yeah,
[12572.30s -> 12580.58s]  but you is that that's it might not be real though. He's left. Let's go this way.
[12590.57s -> 12608.42s]  Goma charger. All right, let's do it. We're in Goma with Rhino. Two of them.
[12609.54s -> 12623.70s]  Fuck. I'm gonna dodge and then do a dab punch instead. All right, good. Good.
[12628.70s -> 12638.92s]  Dude, Nintendo in chat. Hey, welcome back. All right, I have to stop paying attention to what
[12638.92s -> 12656.15s]  you guys are doing. You're losing viewers. You have to do something about that. Well,
[12656.15s -> 12677.69s]  they were here for one reason and I don't that whatever. Oh, shit. Well, I really should have
[12677.69s -> 12705.59s]  used that now. Jesus. Oh, my God. No help. Oh, here it comes. Go to kill him. What was that weird?
[12705.59s -> 12713.18s]  Okay, that was you see that turn. That was like an instant turn. Instant turn. Hopefully,
[12713.18s -> 12749.10s]  it's right there. Why is chat focused on everything but the game? Well, I think it's because
[12751.90s -> 12754.86s]  that sometimes like to do its own thing and just
[12755.66s -> 12774.50s]  they go off on their own. Hence, tends to happen because we're bored.
[12777.35s -> 12799.82s]  I'll get some like Nickelodeon gag and fucking play with it. Oh, don't you fucking dare screw
[12799.82s -> 12811.19s]  this up. Please be dead. Please be dead. Please be dead. It's not dead. It's not dead.
[12811.19s -> 12850.71s]  I almost have enough. There it is. Invincible. Burst him. You saw boobs. It's over.
[12852.55s -> 12869.13s]  You didn't. You saw somebody in a bath. A big one. That's it. Another turtle. Oh,
[12869.13s -> 12879.30s]  we've already seen the turtle. This is not a new enemy.
[12879.30s -> 12887.54s]  I got hit by it. I got hit by the end of it.
[12892.04s -> 12902.46s]  I want to get killed. Get hit in the back. Get hit in the head. It's not doing anything.
[12906.86s -> 12922.39s]  Giant enemy turtle. That's right. Dude, how the fuck am I supposed to avoid that? That seems
[12922.39s -> 12932.98s]  unavoidable. Run? He just run away. I can't dodge it.
[12936.04s -> 12943.50s]  Can I leave? Can you do something? Oh, you're not. Just jump. You gotta jump.
[12952.28s -> 12961.43s]  Invincible. Just spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam.
[12961.43s -> 12974.89s]  Just keep doing that. Invincible. Watch out.
[12986.28s -> 12992.57s]  He's learning. Yes. Very slowly, but I am.
[13001.59s -> 13009.03s]  If I get hit once, I'm dead. So that'd be very, very, very sad. What are you gonna do?
[13009.67s -> 13023.85s]  Eh. Shoot him. I can't.
[13027.42s -> 13047.77s]  You can build your meter. It doesn't work. It's not doing anything. That's not doing shit.
[13052.39s -> 13069.61s]  Your other meter. Oh, the other meter. Right. Right. The LT meter. Well, in that case, let's do it.
[13087.16s -> 13100.57s]  Whoa. He just spawned a fucking rhino. Why didn't he spawn a rhino? It's all right. I have some
[13100.57s -> 13119.37s]  invincible. I'll get it. Come on. Stop spinning. Stop spinning. Holy shit. Oh my God. Oh my God.
[13119.37s -> 13134.54s]  Oh my God. Oh my God. Fuck. I need to watch the. Did I fail them both? I think I failed them both.
[13135.10s -> 13142.22s]  I keep forgetting this. Whatever. Every time there's a cutscene, I go like, yeah, I got a
[13142.22s -> 13149.85s]  minute. Let's look over here. What are you guys saying about this thing? I have to focus the
[13149.85s -> 13153.21s]  whole time I'm playing against the enemy and I look over. Hey, what are you guys doing?
[13153.93s -> 13163.34s]  How have you been, guys? It's in QTEs. It's just less points. Oh, that's all right.
[13163.34s -> 13202.54s]  All right. At least this is different. What is this? Fish. Not fair. We're fighting over who
[13202.54s -> 13218.73s]  gets to kill the giant fish monster. To be continued. Episode 11. Wow. That was a pretty
[13218.73s -> 13234.66s]  long dream. I'm going to go now. You're fighting rhinos and elephants and shit in your dreams,
[13234.66s -> 13250.17s]  man. You got to stop. You got to stop eating hamburgers at 11 o'clock. It's a boomer joke.
[13250.73s -> 13257.66s]  Will I turn 35 this year? Get over it. It's going to be more and more of that. I'm going to fucking
[13257.66s -> 13280.12s]  on. I'm trying to turn 35 in like three days. Episode 11. We actually get to fight this guy.
[13286.46s -> 13290.30s]  They say Lord August has gone off to find the fallen one. The traitor
[13290.30s -> 13295.74s]  was Lord August's pupil, was he not? Yep. You think Lord August sympathizes with the fallen one?
[13297.64s -> 13301.64s]  No. Lord August is one of the most merciless of the seven. I believe he's gone to finish the
[13301.64s -> 13310.84s]  traitor off. Where did Lord August go? Kanazuki spring. Lord August always goes there to bathe
[13310.84s -> 13322.06s]  before a battle. You guys see squidbillies, right? Who's the lady that lies down like this
[13322.06s -> 13338.26s]  in squidbillies? Earl's like wife. It's the same stance. What's his name? Hurly? Hurly. Yeah.
[13338.26s -> 13345.37s]  I wouldn't be so sure Lord Wyzen and Lord Calro were defeated. Who is to say that Lord August will
[13345.37s -> 13354.42s]  fare any better? We've obviously never seen Lord August in battle. You would not say such things
[13354.42s -> 13359.88s]  if you had. I know because I was a soldier thousands of years ago during the War of Creation.
[13360.52s -> 13363.40s]  No one can defeat Lord August. He's very well made. He's stronger than
[13363.40s -> 13384.98s]  Lord Deus. Now enough of your babble. Move it. Yes, sir. Awesome. I'm turning 21 in a couple weeks.
[13384.98s -> 13392.39s]  Do you have any good drink recommendations? Yeah. Do you like wine? Well, you don't know
[13392.39s -> 13406.47s]  because you can't drink yet. You might. Wine's good. This will do. A good red wine. It has some
[13406.47s -> 13411.03s]  good fruity deep flavors to it. Malbec is my favorite wine. Absolutely.
[13414.07s -> 13426.39s]  Vodka pineapple is also just perfect. What's this song? All right. This is awesome.
[13428.49s -> 13442.78s]  I'm fighting on the moon. Let's go. This is a great setting for a fight.
[13443.83s -> 13453.59s]  Because there ain't shit on the moon. So there's plenty of room. Okay. Well, he just destroyed me.
[13454.55s -> 13477.64s]  Oh my god. If I get hit, I'm dead. I took all of my damage at the very beginning of the fight.
[13477.64s -> 13506.20s]  That's great. What's this? Get it. Put perfect fight music. Oh, fuck. I just walked into it.
[13515.50s -> 13519.66s]  All right. Now I know what's going on. Two, three, four.
[13520.30s -> 13527.86s]  There it is. Yes, this is the hardest. Is it on hard? Is there a difficulty after hard?
[13534.36s -> 13547.48s]  Harder. Wow. This isn't too bad. It's really nice. You die in like three hits, but
[13547.48s -> 13551.40s]  it's not too bad. This probably would have been too easy on normal.
[13567.00s -> 13579.59s]  Do I lack critical information? Somehow. Why? What that means?
[13580.07s -> 13600.70s]  Okay. That's a good sign. Get it. Get it. Come on. Yes.
[13612.10s -> 13636.39s]  Again? What the fuck? What's going on? Okay. Again. Again? Dragon ball fight is kind of ridiculous.
[13637.11s -> 13655.66s]  Again?
[13669.24s -> 13670.68s]  Here comes the sword.
[13679.38s -> 13693.42s]  On the next episode. Is it going to do that to us?
[13694.47s -> 13700.63s]  As deity, the only other person August has ever drawn his sword against is you, my Lord.
[13702.44s -> 13707.03s]  Is he that powerful? Oh, interesting.
[13714.28s -> 13730.74s]  You guys. Deus means God, by the way. All right. Cool. That's my favorite comedy. I love that.
[13731.46s -> 13760.73s]  Great. They caught it. Jesus. And whoa. Jump. All right. It's time to make it all the way to him.
[13760.73s -> 13767.11s]  Yeah. Definitely. What the fuck is that? Whoa. All right. No, we're not good. We're not good.
[13767.11s -> 13796.14s]  He does it twice. Just two swings. Fuck. Oh my God. Holy shit, man. What the hell is this?
[13802.18s -> 13812.60s]  All right. Now the music's distracting. How did we see the opportunity to hit him?
[13813.24s -> 13849.21s]  Thank God. It's not the whole fight. Shoot him. Breathe. All right. Yeah. He does three.
[13850.25s -> 13896.23s]  Holy shit. What's happening? Give me that meter. Let's do it. Two, three. More, more, more, more,
[13896.23s -> 13905.90s]  more. Get in, in, in, in, in, in. All right. Fine. Just get it. All right. Don't. Don't blow this.
[13905.90s -> 13909.74s]  Don't use it. Wait till he does it before he comes over to you. There we go.
[13910.46s -> 13914.34s]  What? Oh shit. He didn't do the thing I thought he was going to do.
[13919.50s -> 13935.08s]  Don't. Don't. Don't. I just need to. He's going to dash. There it goes. To use it. No. I used to
[13935.08s -> 13959.61s]  miss the four. This is an extra long sword.
[13960.25s -> 13970.57s]  Is it going to be this big for the rest of the fight? That should be pretty cool. He's got this
[13970.57s -> 13998.49s]  huge hole. Oh God. I'm losing my arms again. What the fuck is going on? How can they still
[13998.49s -> 14007.74s]  hear each other? There's a hole on either end of that sword. They're just putting their morphoboots
[14007.74s -> 14014.66s]  in. Don't rip your blind eyes out. Then he puts his ear up to it in your
[14031.24s -> 14045.29s]  flashback. Oh, another meteor. Must be Monday.
[14069.11s -> 14076.49s]  If you can hang on for this long, just lift your body up and make it settle this forward motion.
[14076.49s -> 14078.81s]  What the hell is he going to do then? He's going to tip over and fall.
[14079.77s -> 14106.76s]  Look forward. You made it. Did I get it?
[14116.30s -> 14119.10s]  Harmless again for the second time today.
[14137.66s -> 14143.18s]  It's been 12,000 years since you've lost the arm. Oh. Yeah, that's right.
[14143.74s -> 14164.63s]  Yet you continue to fight. Anybody want a water or something?
[14164.63s -> 14171.74s]  You no longer need my training. One who stands in the end is righteous.
[14178.38s -> 14185.18s]  Can I get you guys anything? You know, I just love a black coffee.
[14185.74s -> 14208.14s]  You guys have that here? Ew, black coffee minus two.
[14213.11s -> 14215.83s]  What? If you drink coffee at a diner, I always get a question.
[14216.63s -> 14222.15s]  Why is that? Why is that? Why is it minus two? I drink black coffee at a diner.
[14224.54s -> 14229.98s]  Bad show. That's a big, that's a huge snake stegosaurus.
[14242.18s -> 14253.56s]  We lose frames here. What's going on? We're good. I think we're good.
[14253.56s -> 14265.66s]  Give it a refresh. Maybe it looks like we dropped something. I'm just walking like this.
[14266.14s -> 14271.58s]  I'm running away from her?
[14273.26s -> 14291.10s]  Should be good now. A little all over the place, but it'll be all right.
[14309.96s -> 14313.48s]  Well, turn and run the other way. This is when you turn and run the other way.
[14325.78s -> 14331.54s]  Part two, rebirth episode two. But what epi- oh no. No, no, no. That's- it's not part 11.
[14331.54s -> 14336.82s]  Part 11, rebirth episode 11. That's not correct. They got the Roman numerals there.
[14352.02s -> 14356.50s]  Viewers just jumped up like crazy. Oh, I- did we get front page?
[14357.54s -> 14361.30s]  That's a lot of people that just came in. Hi guys. This has been no raid or anything.
[14362.34s -> 14371.98s]  Is it a host from somewhere? Now they're all gone.
[14378.54s -> 14387.10s]  That's the equivalent of, um, like you called an elevator and there's like fucking a shitload
[14387.10s -> 14391.29s]  of people on the elevator when it opens. And then you just, you're just like, nah,
[14392.09s -> 14398.90s]  no one's getting off and just keep going. Just keep going. Like, oh, is this, is this our,
[14398.90s -> 14402.02s]  is this our floor? No, no, no. Someone pressed the button and there's not enough room.
[14402.82s -> 14415.66s]  Ah, whatever. Bye dickhead. A village on the outskirts of Shinkoku in the plaza.
[14417.69s -> 14422.01s]  No, why am I still alive? If I, if I had only prayed more, perhaps then they would have
[14422.01s -> 14431.42s]  accepted my soul. Why is my voice high pitched? What? My voice is high pitched? Returnable.
[14431.42s -> 14446.34s]  What? You're freaking me out. It's high? What? No, it's not. Look, look. Actually on
[14446.90s -> 14460.34s]  the front page. Oh, well, yeah, that's cool. No, that's not the right, whatever. This was
[14460.34s -> 14464.74s]  our chance to be guided to heaven. Oh, what are we to do now? We must pray. If we continue praying,
[14464.74s -> 14472.28s]  they will surely guide our souls as well. What's wrong with all of you? Why do you do nothing but
[14472.28s -> 14478.30s]  pray for death? This isn't right. I feel like I'm going to be sick. A high pitched thing is
[14478.30s -> 14485.75s]  an audio glitch. Refresh. You literally sound like a chipmunk. What are you talking about?
[14488.86s -> 14496.47s]  I sound, I'm high pitched? Just refresh your page. I need to leave this place. I don't want
[14496.47s -> 14504.71s]  to be here anywhere but here. Episode 11, Zenora on episode 12. A little while later, Baron Field.
[14505.35s -> 14516.30s]  What is that? Ah, that must be him. He's fighting in the heavens again. It can't be Agoma. Agoma
[14516.30s -> 14526.23s]  unborn from the heavens. It has to be him. I won't just wait here and pray. I have to make it there.
[14526.23s -> 14537.78s]  I have to get to his battle. A village. It's a mobile app bug though. Oh, whatever.
[14538.98s -> 14568.49s]  Few days after the mysterious explosion, I turned to stone. I just keep dying, huh?
[14579.99s -> 14602.06s]  Well, gods of death. I wink. How do you know my name? Okay, has she only seen me with no arms?
[14603.58s -> 14628.60s]  I think this is the only impression I've ever had on this person. You're so blue.
[14629.24s -> 14632.84s]  Because I didn't, I just plugged the mic in. I mean, I plugged the webcam in just to be able
[14632.84s -> 14641.21s]  to do that. I'm not wearing, you know how much I'd be sweating if I had that on the whole time?
[14642.25s -> 14669.42s]  Can I run faster? Can I trade my wink for Otto's feet? No. It very clearly says
[14669.42s -> 14679.91s]  wink in camera. It's currently 61 in Las Vegas. Yeah, but I'm indoors wearing a suit jacket.
[14679.91s -> 14684.55s]  Like, you know, I'm indoors in this one room wearing a suit jacket just sitting here.
[14689.35s -> 14693.99s]  No, I'm not doing it now. I'm doing it because it's the only clothes that people that just
[14693.99s -> 14712.12s]  came here have no idea. Why am I in a suit jacket? I just know. What a weirdo.
[14720.62s -> 14725.42s]  I'm not wearing it right now. No. All right. I have to explain this to a bunch of people
[14725.42s -> 14730.06s]  probably are here that weren't here like two hours ago. I don't have any clothes right now.
[14730.70s -> 14735.34s]  They're being washed. They're being, I don't have anything. I don't have any,
[14735.34s -> 14739.74s]  I'm literally naked right now. So I had to grab something real quick. So I have a suit jacket top
[14740.30s -> 14744.62s]  that if somebody has to redeem a fucking wink, I have to put on my suit jacket and
[14744.62s -> 14779.80s]  wink into the camera. It's a long story. That was a great image looking right. I feel like
[14779.80s -> 14785.56s]  that's how I look if somebody has like a camera. I went to their house and you bring their door
[14785.56s -> 14788.52s]  up. It's like, okay, I'm ready. And then you just look up and you're like, oh, hi.
[14788.60s -> 14792.12s]  Hi. I'm on camera up there. Hi.
[14795.16s -> 14831.98s]  Okay. That audio was full three seconds before it happened. What? I'm still out here.
[14835.45s -> 14838.65s]  I know I'm putting on my jacket. Just wait a second.
[14838.65s -> 14867.10s]  Wait, I've been live for four hours. I didn't stop in the middle of the stream to
[14867.10s -> 14874.87s]  change my laundry over. What? Oh, excuse me, guys. Yeah. Two hours ago, I had to,
[14875.59s -> 14906.66s]  I took my laundry out of the dryer. Let's see another quality content. There was not
[14906.66s -> 14920.06s]  another one. I can look. I'm going to do this. How am I going to do this? Impossible. This is
[14920.06s -> 14927.93s]  fucking impossible. How is he? How is it impossible to do this? Like, this is impossible.
[14934.81s -> 14961.69s]  Seriously. Fucking not even possible. See? Impossible. Two winks for deemed.
[14962.33s -> 14964.97s]  Hold on. Currently dealing with a fucking impossible thing here.
[14965.13s -> 14971.77s]  Okay. Thank you for that. Another wink. I'll hold on.
[14978.10s -> 15005.54s]  Hey, I know it's fake. It was real. I can smell your bullshit from a mile away.
[15005.54s -> 15015.43s]  There's been at least two real ones and I've done two. What's one of my lips? Oh, why am I a corpse?
[15016.15s -> 15028.87s]  Is this what girls do? I know it's blue, but my, why am I lips like that?
[15028.87s -> 15044.78s]  There is no need. That's that only take our gods are dead.
[15049.90s -> 15056.39s]  He's freezing. He had some food. He looked like violet from Willy Wonka. Why is he freezing?
[15056.47s -> 15068.84s]  Someone help him. God. Crack stream part two.
[15097.35s -> 15102.82s]  Who defied the seven deities.
[15106.55s -> 15113.70s]  I thought we didn't get the, I was really hoping we were going to get the
[15114.18s -> 15135.91s]  Oh, if only I had arms, why does today after 12,000 years have to be the day that I don't have
[15135.91s -> 15207.14s]  fucking arms? No, you mouth. That's not going to work. Blink was fake. Let me say something.
[15208.10s -> 15253.22s]  I've upgraded. I got my arms back. Now they have eyes on. Oh, I'm a skull girl.
[15280.36s -> 15281.00s]  Oh geez.
[15293.53s -> 15298.33s]  Okay. That was a lot. That was like just dead instantly. How many people are on this ship?
[15299.21s -> 15302.86s]  I don't have enough time to scream about anything. It's just like, oh my, no, no, no.
[15303.66s -> 15344.12s]  Are these these people in part of fight playing trauma center? I remember that game. That game
[15344.12s -> 15363.80s]  was crazy. Okay. What's the, what's the over under that? This is another head's wish.
[15398.46s -> 15423.66s]  Do it. Bullets are coming from every single missile at that.
[15425.34s -> 15461.22s]  They're half-assed until you can't count it. Yes. Good. I'm kind of getting into
[15461.22s -> 15485.70s]  bat boy territory here. It's getting there. Hey, by the way, in case you haven't figured it out yet,
[15486.34s -> 15493.86s]  Capcom made this game and cyber connect to also did this stuff in case every single we just,
[15493.86s -> 15503.80s]  let's remind you every 20 minutes. They even was a full on credit sequence where he was
[15503.80s -> 15513.37s]  floating around in the credits of going scrolling down the screen. I think it's a little late for
[15513.37s -> 15545.06s]  credits. It's animated. Okay. No, no, no. I'm sorry. You can't, you can't. And what do you say now?
[15545.70s -> 15559.99s]  What are you saying now about that? Okay. Those are the pre credits to the real credits
[15563.26s -> 15589.54s]  season two ending, please be floating. It's DLC time. No, it's not.
[15590.50s -> 15603.21s]  No, this is part two rebirth end. Oh, no, we got like, we got like five more episodes.
[15604.17s -> 15615.66s]  It's time to kill Diablo. What? I'm not even, I'm not done with this game. What are you talking
[15615.66s -> 15620.54s]  about? All right, man. Oh yeah. You got, you got to the end. All right, let's go. It's time to kill
[15620.54s -> 15631.98s]  Diablo on hardcore. Let's go. No, we have the, we're not done. Guys, I'm streaming for five
[15631.98s -> 15653.94s]  days in a row. There's plenty of time to kill Diablo. Yeah, we're good. This is part three.
[15660.49s -> 15669.08s]  Make sure to pace yourself. No, I'll be all right. We got plenty of stuff to play. So it's not like,
[15669.72s -> 15679.98s]  you know, I hope we can. I need stuff to do. Drink water. I've been hooked up to a saline
[15679.98s -> 15693.21s]  IV this whole stream guys. I'm fine. Golden spider rise and shine. Asura. I lost myself again.
[15696.25s -> 15699.29s]  No, you haven't lost anything. You've gained the power to save the world.
[15701.14s -> 15703.14s]  I could not even save a little girl with this power.
[15704.20s -> 15716.60s]  Oh, no, that's not, that's sorry. That's not him. Let me fix that. Oh, wait, you have a destiny.
[15716.60s -> 15722.26s]  I got cut off there. Somebody turned the stream off right when I got in the middle of that one.
[15722.26s -> 15725.93s]  You have a destiny to fulfill. I was going to scream really loud when it was like, I don't want
[15725.93s -> 15736.87s]  my voice to hurt. I'm streaming for five days in a row. Oh, I'm not going to do it. I'm sorry.
[15737.43s -> 15759.16s]  Oh, oh, testing. Overwhelming power surging through. What are you guys linking me here?
[15759.16s -> 15769.74s]  Kind of showing me something important. That's creepy. Freaky. What even is that part three?
[15769.74s -> 15792.38s]  Karma. Frogger for the Gameboy. You play as a frog. Dumbass. Even August could not defeat you.
[15793.26s -> 15802.23s]  Why does that make me a dumbass? Why do you keep coming back? What is it that you are fighting for?
[15802.23s -> 15809.19s]  And this power of yours? How can it surpass the power that took us 12,000 years to attain?
[15810.47s -> 15822.18s]  Needed no more heroes this week? Maybe. We'll see. We'll see. He is too much of a threat.
[15822.18s -> 15833.77s]  He must be stopped here and now. Ready the Bromastra. What was the Bromastra?
[15837.75s -> 15862.68s]  Hey, it sounds like my microphone. What was that? It's the Death Star, but this time it's made out
[15862.68s -> 15888.98s]  of a human in the shape of a human. This is the giant human Death Star. This is a cosmic entity.
[15891.48s -> 15897.02s]  You cannot do this with that one blast. Do you realize how much mantra will be lost?
[15897.82s -> 15903.46s]  All the souls that have been given for the cause. Do you not realize that this will hinder the coming
[15903.46s -> 15909.62s]  of the Great Rebirth? Then we will just get more mantra. With the mortals under our control,
[15909.62s -> 15912.66s]  our supply is endless. You guys never like put a crack in your iPad and don't get it fixed?
[15912.66s -> 15919.14s]  If we do not finish him now, there will be no Great Rebirth. Wait. I will finish Asura.
[15919.14s -> 15926.18s]  Like you did before. If we finish him now, once and for all, he can never come back.
[15927.06s -> 15940.55s]  This is made for the eradication of the Goma. This conversation is over. You will not interfere.
[15941.43s -> 15956.30s]  Bad guy, good guy, bad guy becomes good guy, good guy. I will not let you do this. He's drawn on
[15956.30s -> 15967.27s]  muscles. This dude's, he's a fat guy, but he drew on the muscles. I guess he's around all these
[15967.27s -> 15973.40s]  demigods all the time. I guess he needs to keep up, I guess. The mantra finishes loading.
[15984.23s -> 15986.70s]  I'm not going to stop this injustice.
[15990.70s -> 15994.70s]  Do I get to play as a new character now? I do.
[16014.97s -> 16035.10s]  That sound is, where is it from? It's from something. It's like a lasso or something.
[16037.02s -> 16038.34s]  From everything. Yeah.
[16041.70s -> 16058.34s]  Come here. That's a cool move. I need somebody to fight. Let's go.
[16065.70s -> 16070.46s]  Come here. Flip him down. I don't even know what I'm doing. I'm doing cool shit though.
[16070.46s -> 16107.02s]  Bad, bad, bad. Did I grab it? I didn't. Did I?
[16120.01s -> 16121.74s]  Excuse me. Excuse me.
[16129.40s -> 16138.31s]  Fake Link? I know. I think it's even a real one. Come on. What? He's not falling for it. No.
[16139.27s -> 16159.21s]  I need to play Ninja Gaiden. Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden.
[16159.21s -> 16168.74s]  Even gods are not important. Ninja Gaiden. Not Ninja Gaiden.
[16172.66s -> 16181.14s]  Whatever. Ninja Gaiden. The Brahmastra has entered the final preparation phase.
[16182.10s -> 16190.04s]  Commencing mantra charge. Mantra charge completion in T minus five minutes.
[16191.00s -> 16200.23s]  It's begun. I must hurry. I have Black here. Shooter, Black. That's a classic.
[16207.03s -> 16252.98s]  I can't hit them? Well, just take a deep breath. Go outside. Get some air. Come back.
[16252.98s -> 16271.29s]  All right, that's pretty cool. That's a cool vehicle. Where are they? Right here? To the right?
[16271.29s -> 16273.29s]  To the right? I'm going to run into them.
[16285.50s -> 16285.98s]  Watch it.
[16291.46s -> 16322.84s]  Just use it. Kill, kill. Oh, fuck. Oh, that hurt. Oh, please.
[16335.85s -> 16340.52s]  Is this a mobile game? Why are you just saying that?
[16341.48s -> 16347.80s]  You're getting me going. I think saying that because I've been playing this game for like
[16347.80s -> 16350.68s]  four and a half hours, so I think that saying that's going to make me be like,
[16351.72s -> 16354.36s]  what the fuck, dude? Mobile? Come on, dude. Give me a break.
[16358.76s -> 16406.68s]  All the break. Good. Just good. This would be a pretty cool iPad game, honestly. That's cool.
[16407.48s -> 16412.49s]  We're going to see. We're going to see it coming up in the horizon. Where is he?
[16413.45s -> 16418.41s]  Well, we got to see it and then now it's not here anymore. Come on.
[16418.41s -> 16421.37s]  I thought we were going to get a cool sequence where I ran down into his mouth or something.
[16448.81s -> 16465.61s]  Jesus. I can't even fucking see what's going on. How do I dodge that? Oh,
[16468.10s -> 16512.82s]  I'm just going to use this. Use it. Use it. Use it. Don't die. Am I using it? Going in. My health.
[16512.82s -> 16547.51s]  Well, final sequence. Am I invisible? Does this count as your anime for the year?
[16549.82s -> 16568.06s]  This is not a television show. I'm not watching this on TV. I'm playing this on my Xbox 360 console.
[16569.26s -> 16581.08s]  Not. This is a video game. Where am I going? That's a lot of people.
[16581.80s -> 16604.26s]  Am I going to get it? I didn't make it. All that for nothing. I didn't even make it.
[16618.60s -> 16640.10s]  I couldn't. I couldn't stop the migraine beam. Okay. Oh, well, he's going to. He can't do it.
[16641.54s -> 16676.34s]  Let's rewind 12,000 years and learn about why we lost. I feel like this is you guys in chat right
[16676.34s -> 16683.00s]  now. This is me and this is you guys about how you feel about this game. You're just like,
[16683.80s -> 16697.59s]  oh no. The motion. Oh, Yasha's interference has diverted the beam. Damage report. Unable to fire.
[16699.10s -> 16716.26s]  Damn you, Yasha. That was a big beam. Hey, some protagonists just are unstoppable. It's good to
[16716.26s -> 16722.94s]  see that this protagonist dies all the time and loses every fight. Cause I support it. This has
[16722.94s -> 16732.63s]  always turned into stone, burnt to death. I've died three times in the course of four and a half hours.
[16733.35s -> 16762.33s]  And one of those was 12,000 years ago. So not bad. His power of molding is infinite. He's just so
[16762.33s -> 16771.91s]  angry. He keeps coming back. It's a 13 causing him. I gotta take my jacket off. I'm starting
[16771.91s -> 16777.86s]  to sweat in this thing. I was scared that there was going to be a wink. Somewhere on Gaia. To
[16777.86s -> 16785.34s]  maintain my beauty, a little exercise is necessary once in a while. Consider it an honor to be purified
[16785.34s -> 16790.92s]  by someone with such grace. That's what I would say if any of you impure had any brains.
[16798.20s -> 16803.48s]  This is the only chance for you filth to shine. After dashing through the horde of Goma,
[16804.20s -> 16808.52s]  Serjei bows gracefully at the same moment. The Goma are ripped to shreds in the background.
[16809.40s -> 16859.11s]  At least you can die beautifully. Lord Serjei, I have a report. During our attempt to fire the
[16859.11s -> 16869.46s]  Brahmastra upon Asura, Lord Yasha interfered in deflective blast. God, guys. All right,
[16869.46s -> 16874.82s]  I'm just going to keep it on. How do you have this many points? How do you have like a million
[16874.82s -> 16888.33s]  points? Where did you get a million points? A typical of him. I knew he would show his true
[16888.33s -> 16897.27s]  colors one day. And what does he look in his face? Yes, sir. Lord Deus has summoned you regarding
[16897.27s -> 16906.97s]  the incident. Tell him I'll be right there. I got fooled? That wasn't the right thing?
[16908.01s -> 16930.01s]  I was at 14. Actually, my internet died for hours and you're still playing this.
[16930.73s -> 16935.18s]  Yeah, I'm going to play. I'm going to beat this game.
[16944.10s -> 16951.83s]  How is it such a foreign concept everybody? I'm going to play. I'm going to play this game today.
[16952.63s -> 16958.71s]  That's cool. You're still playing this? But this is what we do. Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[16959.43s -> 16969.59s]  That's what I'm doing today. I know you're busy, but can I get a high five? Yeah, you can.
[16970.47s -> 16998.66s]  That just like scared me. Well, well, here they come. I don't know. For some reason,
[16998.66s -> 17003.46s]  people think that I'm going to get like halfway through the game and be like, oh, yeah, I'll keep
[17003.46s -> 17008.66s]  going. No, no, no. I'm going to hit the power bugs and then spike the Xbox into the ground
[17008.66s -> 17016.92s]  and watch it explode and then press a button and here's Jump King. Dude, why are you still
[17016.92s -> 17023.21s]  playing this? Get out, rip the power cord up and then press button. Here we go. Jump King.
[17030.25s -> 17039.43s]  Dude, how have you not spiked your Xbox into the ground already?
[17040.39s -> 17068.89s]  This is pretty cool. Disney ride. And they said,
[17070.41s -> 17074.25s]  you're getting the true ending DLC, right? This is not a joke. Here's money for it.
[17075.21s -> 17101.98s]  I don't know. Are you sure you don't want me to smash my Xbox? Here's $300 for a new Xbox.
[17101.98s -> 17133.02s]  Xbox 360 is not $300. It's like 60. It's like less than 80 bucks. What is this fish doing?
[17134.06s -> 17138.71s]  Does anyone have any idea of what this is actually doing? Why is it doing this?
[17139.59s -> 17148.04s]  Like, get the fuck away from me. No, he's just like, get out of here. Like, you're just in a way.
[17162.52s -> 17163.16s]  I'm trying.
[17175.19s -> 17186.97s]  Now, are you winning some? Yeah.
[17187.61s -> 17194.95s]  And because of it, three fourths of the karma fortresses mantra consumed.
[17196.15s -> 17210.41s]  Two hours earlier. That is everything I witnessed. My body's just hot right now.
[17210.41s -> 17223.83s]  Just heat is coming out of my body. But yes, I, why do you hesitate? Speak. All these years,
[17224.63s -> 17231.11s]  I have believed in the cause. But asura's mantra has proven powerful enough to rival that of our own,
[17231.67s -> 17238.50s]  that of the Brahmastra. After the blast, we lost track of his whereabouts.
[17238.50s -> 17242.42s]  We did not know when he might attack again. Lord deus.
[17250.70s -> 17256.62s]  Lord deus, I have a report to make. I used the Brahmastra on Asura. Yes, I already know.
[17257.58s -> 17262.06s]  You're dismissed. But my lord, Yasha tried to-
[17262.06s -> 17262.70s]  Dismissed!
[17273.14s -> 17279.54s]  Must I repeat myself a third time?
[17279.54s -> 17281.14s]  Who's this thing's snoked motherfucker?
[17282.90s -> 17286.38s]  Lord, forgive me.
[17287.98s -> 17303.50s]  He just sits in a chair and just goes, but you can't see, he's not any closer.
[17313.99s -> 17315.91s]  Yasha. Sir.
[17319.08s -> 17322.36s]  Power without a purpose is meaningless and worthless.
[17323.00s -> 17326.28s]  A purpose that is firm can change the impossible.
[17327.16s -> 17335.40s]  Wait, this is a boss fight right now? Stories bouncing around all over the place.
[17347.51s -> 17348.79s]  Here comes the boss battle music.
[17348.79s -> 17369.59s]  It was quite entertaining. So dedicated tennis in our fight. There is nothing more to discuss.
[17369.59s -> 17373.51s]  An absolute shitload of community subs just came in. About 32 nixums.
[17373.51s -> 17375.59s]  Sir, I want you to bring Yasha with excellent determination.
[17375.59s -> 17377.99s]  Thank you for the 20 community subs.
[17378.95s -> 17379.75s]  That's a storm.
[17382.68s -> 17385.16s]  Thank you. Thank you, Richard Nixon.
[17385.16s -> 17386.84s]  He has merely forgotten.
[17386.84s -> 17389.19s]  That's a lot of subs.
[17393.58s -> 17397.78s]  As you wish.
[17397.78s -> 17400.66s]  20 community subs. Goddamn, thank you.
[17400.66s -> 17406.34s]  Report. Large mass of Goma confirmed. They are headed for a city in the vicinity of Shinto.
[17406.34s -> 17409.46s]  These are just- these are the toads of this universe. We just figured it out.
[17409.46s -> 17411.06s]  Requesting permission for immediate purification.
[17411.06s -> 17413.46s]  Ah, a purification.
[17413.46s -> 17414.10s]  Holy shit.
[17414.10s -> 17415.22s]  How beautiful.
[17416.41s -> 17419.77s]  Uh, Snarabossus just gave 20 community subs.
[17420.49s -> 17429.53s]  That's 40 subs. 20 back to back. Thanks, guys. Snarabossus.
[17431.05s -> 17445.24s]  Can they be evolved? You can just buy a new Xbox.
[17446.20s -> 17451.51s]  Break something. I own one already. Why would I do that?
[17460.78s -> 17465.85s]  Because it's funny. It's funny.
[17480.60s -> 17481.40s]  Well, that was different.
[17484.23s -> 17486.39s]  All right, it's another elephant.
[17487.75s -> 17489.59s]  Ah, now here's the real filler episode.
[17489.59s -> 17490.87s]  We already did elephant before.
[17491.83s -> 17493.75s]  Elephant and turtle will both filler episodes.
[17494.71s -> 17511.83s]  This is elephant episode. Turtle episode.
[17518.42s -> 17519.91s]  Meter, meter, meter.
[17522.23s -> 17533.62s]  Come on. Meter.
[17537.22s -> 17538.02s]  There it is.
[17538.02s -> 17541.86s]  Oh, well, good time to use it is with two fucking rhinos.
[17542.82s -> 17545.64s]  Just focus on him.
[17546.92s -> 17547.90s]  Focus on the elephant.
[17548.70s -> 17551.18s]  I'm invincible.
[17552.52s -> 17558.38s]  Am I still invincible?
[17559.26s -> 17561.83s]  Doesn't matter.
[17561.83s -> 17566.76s]  It was so laggy. I couldn't even.
[17567.40s -> 17584.01s]  Offline. He's lagging offline.
[17584.01s -> 17586.57s]  Nice lie. Nice lie. Lagging offline.
[17588.09s -> 17597.03s]  Because that was a good, uh, small clip from the movie.
[17597.75s -> 17609.06s]  Brute ninja.
[17609.06s -> 17616.04s]  I feel bad about that.
[17617.08s -> 17619.32s]  Anybody else feel bad after watching that?
[17620.20s -> 17648.52s]  Who did that?
[17649.98s -> 17651.66s]  Septentrion, Mizar.
[17663.66s -> 17682.12s]  See how they're summoned to please their gods.
[17685.59s -> 17687.11s]  Oh, he's tossing it aside.
[17689.27s -> 17692.78s]  You're gonna throw it at me?
[17703.34s -> 17704.46s]  I thought he gave it the finger.
[17705.26s -> 17707.14s]  I thought he just flipped off the town.
[17720.18s -> 17721.06s]  What's this for again?
[17728.68s -> 17731.64s]  Before the mortals are devoured by the goma,
[17731.64s -> 17736.81s]  we purify their souls and turn them into our power.
[17736.81s -> 17739.02s]  This is nothing new.
[17739.02s -> 17742.62s]  It's the same thing you've been doing for the past 12,000 years.
[17743.58s -> 17748.49s]  You've just fought a meaningless battle.
[17748.49s -> 17749.61s]  Oh, where's their weapons?
[17751.59s -> 17752.31s]  Bastards.
[17752.31s -> 17758.89s]  One way or another, their swords muster up.
[17758.89s -> 17765.30s]  One's behavior has been more resting for them.
[17765.30s -> 17767.22s]  You ever think about just breaking fucking decap?
[17780.52s -> 17783.59s]  Gods must dirty their hands.
[17784.31s -> 17787.38s]  And then he goes to spit in his face,
[17787.38s -> 17788.90s]  but he forgets he has the mask on right there,
[17788.90s -> 17790.42s]  and it just hits him right in the bottom of the mask.
[17801.98s -> 17802.94s]  It was me.
[17809.27s -> 17812.23s]  Dead, but well, there goes another boss.
[17812.23s -> 17813.03s]  That's not a boss.
[17813.75s -> 17819.32s]  He's getting more and more Lord of the Rings golem.
[17819.96s -> 17827.16s]  Every time we see him, he's going full hollow at this point.
[17842.55s -> 17847.00s]  Hey, D, roll B, I'll take it.
[17847.56s -> 17850.34s]  It's time to roll credits.
[17852.54s -> 17855.66s]  Play an ad.
[17859.74s -> 17861.58s]  I can't even run ads on my channel, guys.
[17862.62s -> 17865.38s]  Every time I've tried, it doesn't work.
[17865.38s -> 17876.92s]  OmegaLul, no ad Andy.
[17889.67s -> 17891.83s]  Report of Asura's movements.
[17891.83s -> 17894.47s]  Search troop Captain Upala's log.
[17895.19s -> 17899.59s]  This mission to find traces of Asura's movements has proven very challenging.
[17899.59s -> 17903.11s]  The blast from the Brahmastra has set the land ablaze,
[17903.11s -> 17905.67s]  which still continues erasing any tracks Asura left behind.
[17906.23s -> 17908.63s]  Despite this, we carried on with our mission in the search of
[17908.63s -> 17909.51s]  whatever we could find.
[17910.15s -> 17913.51s]  Fortunately, we were able to find some footprints on a snow field quite far.
[17915.27s -> 17917.16s]  We followed them immediately.
[17917.16s -> 17921.32s]  After a while in the distance, we discovered one of our fleets in mid-battle with the Impure.
[17922.44s -> 17923.48s]  That is when it appeared.
[17930.07s -> 17934.55s]  A scorched black soot-covered body with the rage glowing in its eyes.
[17934.55s -> 17937.19s]  By the time we realized it was the fallen one, the battle had already begun.
[17938.23s -> 17942.39s]  Watching from afar, neither our fellow soldiers nor the Goma were any match for him.
[17942.39s -> 17945.91s]  Terrified by what was happening before our eyes, we could do nothing but hide and shiver with fear.
[17946.95s -> 17949.75s]  After the fallen had annihilated them all,
[17949.75s -> 17953.11s]  he roared out towards the heavens as if he were calling out to someone.
[17958.82s -> 17960.82s]  After that, I continued to pursue Asura.
[17961.54s -> 17964.66s]  My men were horrified and ran away, but by that time I did not care.
[17965.62s -> 17970.18s]  Asura ran onward and encountered more Shinkoku soldiers and Goma,
[17970.18s -> 17972.18s]  which he ripped to shreds in an instant.
[17972.90s -> 17977.06s]  Interestingly enough, he had no eyes for civilian demigods or humans,
[17977.06s -> 17977.86s]  and left them alone.
[17978.90s -> 17981.54s]  At that moment, Asura is headed toward the area
[17981.54s -> 17984.66s]  where Lord Serjay and Lord Yasha are conducting a purification.
[17986.10s -> 17988.02s]  What is he? What is he trying to do?
[17989.64s -> 17991.96s]  Sound of his ferocious cry still rings in my ears.
[17991.96s -> 17993.40s]  I must know what it all means.
[17994.20s -> 17994.70s]  Okay.
[17996.86s -> 17999.22s]  He's doing Obama.
[17999.22s -> 18000.35s]  Was I?
[18005.99s -> 18006.49s]  Loss.
[18013.56s -> 18014.06s]  Now what?
[18014.84s -> 18023.51s]  So this guy, this guy turned out to be kind of a chump, huh?
[18023.51s -> 18032.76s]  Wait, am I making, am I doing it right?
[18032.76s -> 18034.92s]  I thought it was like puppeting him.
[18044.86s -> 18050.76s]  Is this a Gatorade commercial?
[18080.84s -> 18082.68s]  Just let him like stand on the ground?
[18082.68s -> 18083.32s]  This is weird.
[18084.68s -> 18086.12s]  His feet are just dangling.
[18086.12s -> 18086.62s]  This is odd.
[18086.62s -> 18087.12s]  God.
[18118.97s -> 18119.93s]  Joker audition?
[18123.80s -> 18124.68s]  Kill Jester.
[18124.68s -> 18125.48s]  Kill Jester.
[18147.10s -> 18148.78s]  Why am I holding his head?
[18148.78s -> 18149.82s]  Can't they just talk?
[18149.82s -> 18150.62s]  Ah, this is weird.
[18155.92s -> 18161.64s]  I'm just Venom.
[18168.12s -> 18174.75s]  Head Squish.
[18174.75s -> 18175.55s]  We're gonna get another one.
[18176.43s -> 18177.95s]  I knew we were gonna get another one.
[18177.95s -> 18178.45s]  I knew it.
[18179.63s -> 18180.51s]  This was a matter of time.
[18187.48s -> 18192.68s]  If we get the hat trick on Head Squish's, you owe me a soda.
[18192.68s -> 18201.18s]  What's, okay, what's with this in anime?
[18201.18s -> 18201.74s]  Somebody help me here.
[18203.98s -> 18205.18s]  Everyone always does this.
[18205.18s -> 18208.62s]  They lean, they lean forward like this.
[18208.62s -> 18211.34s]  And they like lean forward and they go like this and their arm is up like this.
[18212.22s -> 18232.32s]  The game started so I have to, oh I have to, I'm playing games myself?
[18233.44s -> 18237.68s]  See, look, he's doing the, he's doing the like I've gone crazy anime stance.
[18238.88s -> 18240.81s]  That happens in every anime.
[18241.53s -> 18242.21s]  Watch.
[18260.20s -> 18262.44s]  Because I've, because I've seen like 10 of them.
[18263.72s -> 18275.12s]  Give me a second.
[18275.92s -> 18277.04s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[18278.72s -> 18286.16s]  Stay with him, stay with him, stay with him, stay with him, stay with him.
[18287.68s -> 18296.89s]  Good, I got some good hits on that one.
[18297.77s -> 18319.53s]  Watch out!
[18319.53s -> 18334.67s]  By one hit, by one fucking hit move thing.
[18334.67s -> 18335.17s]  What?
[18359.63s -> 18368.52s]  Thousand miles per hour.
[18377.79s -> 18379.52s]  Got it.
[18379.52s -> 18386.17s]  Hi, everybody.
[18386.17s -> 18387.77s]  Sorry for doing the ayaya.
[18388.81s -> 18394.06s]  Apologize every day.
[18394.06s -> 18395.66s]  Apologize every day.
[18396.70s -> 18401.90s]  Now, it would be cool if we changed sides, right?
[18401.90s -> 18404.94s]  If they flipped it and now I control, that would be really cool.
[18429.50s -> 18430.38s]  Shit, I missed it.
[18434.96s -> 18436.32s]  That's supposed to happen.
[18436.32s -> 18437.52s]  I think that's supposed to happen.
[18438.40s -> 18439.20s]  I forgot.
[18439.20s -> 18440.00s]  It's supposed to happen.
[18440.80s -> 18442.48s]  Still the same Asura.
[18445.95s -> 18447.07s]  Listen to anyone.
[18449.02s -> 18449.90s]  All right, there's the real.
[18456.36s -> 18464.03s]  Did it work?
[18464.03s -> 18467.55s]  I just ran an ad, I just ran ads.
[18468.35s -> 18474.46s]  It didn't work.
[18477.04s -> 18480.56s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[18481.84s -> 18483.47s]  No one's gonna get any.
[18484.51s -> 18487.47s]  I swear to God, my ad profile is ShadowBand on Twitch.
[18488.03s -> 18488.83s]  I really think it is.
[18489.63s -> 18497.07s]  Hold on, let's see.
[18497.79s -> 18498.43s]  15 seconds.
[18499.39s -> 18502.70s]  Hold on, let's see.
[18503.82s -> 18508.84s]  Okay, hold on, here they come.
[18509.88s -> 18516.00s]  Asura's Wrath.
[18516.00s -> 18528.86s]  How's, did you guys see it?
[18528.86s -> 18530.14s]  You guys gonna have, how's the ad break?
[18530.86s -> 18534.24s]  I got an ad on my phone.
[18534.24s -> 18534.88s]  Oh.
[18534.88s -> 18542.92s]  Is this game vegan?
[18542.92s -> 18543.42s]  Yeah.
[18543.96s -> 18546.75s]  Okay.
[18547.37s -> 18554.49s]  Dude, I don't even know if it's fucking moving.
[18567.61s -> 18568.33s]  Whoa.
[18568.33s -> 18571.47s]  He just fell down.
[18571.47s -> 18572.11s]  He failed the QTE.
[18572.67s -> 18573.17s]  Good.
[18573.55s -> 18574.41s]  Good for us.
[18575.45s -> 18597.45s]  Ah, shit.
[18597.45s -> 18598.17s]  How did I miss that?
[18598.81s -> 18605.76s]  He didn't even put, you see, he put his hand down.
[18605.76s -> 18606.48s]  He didn't even swing.
[18607.61s -> 18608.57s]  He didn't even swing.
[18608.57s -> 18609.77s]  He, he swung after I died.
[18610.41s -> 18619.10s]  His build meter.
[18634.20s -> 18636.09s]  Who the hell am I?
[18636.09s -> 18639.34s]  What the fuck is going on?
[18639.34s -> 18640.14s]  I'm moving too fast.
[18640.14s -> 18641.02s]  I can't even see what I'm doing.
[18641.66s -> 18642.30s]  Who the hell am I?
[18643.36s -> 18643.86s]  What?
[18646.67s -> 18647.17s]  Hello?
[18649.26s -> 18650.38s]  Moving too fast.
[18651.18s -> 18662.84s]  I was moving way too fast.
[18662.84s -> 18674.88s]  Oh, man.
[18674.88s -> 18676.88s]  He fucking killed me.
[18678.00s -> 18679.02s]  Okay.
[18679.02s -> 18679.90s]  I was going too fast.
[18679.90s -> 18681.42s]  I gotta, that's just all super speed.
[18682.62s -> 18683.66s]  All right, let's go.
[18683.66s -> 18691.21s]  I thought, for some reason,
[18691.21s -> 18692.33s]  I thought they could walk around it somehow.
[18692.33s -> 18701.53s]  Get this jacket off.
[18702.49s -> 18704.41s]  I'm getting a goddamn wedding over here.
[18747.44s -> 18748.24s]  Come here.
[18748.24s -> 18750.75s]  Jesus, too fast did I go.
[18754.24s -> 18755.36s]  You move so fast.
[18755.36s -> 18757.12s]  God damn, this is gonna be hard.
[18757.12s -> 18758.16s]  This is the hardest fight so far.
[18759.68s -> 18764.40s]  God, sometimes he doesn't do it.
[18764.40s -> 18764.96s]  Just kill me.
[18764.96s -> 18765.44s]  Just kill me.
[18765.44s -> 18765.92s]  Kill me.
[18765.92s -> 18766.72s]  Kill me.
[18766.72s -> 18767.22s]  Kill me.
[18768.56s -> 18775.16s]  Kill me.
[18775.16s -> 18785.15s]  We have a pee break?
[18785.15s -> 18785.71s]  I need to pee.
[18786.59s -> 18787.79s]  After this mission, we'll do a pee break.
[18792.40s -> 18803.92s]  Finally, he falls down and dash.
[18804.80s -> 18809.88s]  Same deal.
[18810.68s -> 18811.24s]  Getting close.
[18812.04s -> 18814.54s]  Back up.
[18825.66s -> 18826.76s]  Come on.
[18826.76s -> 18827.08s]  Do it.
[18827.08s -> 18827.40s]  Dash.
[18827.96s -> 18833.61s]  Here goes.
[18850.86s -> 18851.42s]  Damn it.
[18851.42s -> 18852.38s]  I thought he was dashing.
[18853.02s -> 18853.42s]  All right.
[18853.42s -> 18854.22s]  Didn't take much damage.
[18857.36s -> 18857.68s]  Fuck.
[18857.68s -> 18858.24s]  I thought he was...
[18859.52s -> 18860.24s]  That's so annoying.
[18860.24s -> 18860.40s]  Fuck.
[18860.40s -> 18861.52s]  I thought he was doing the whole thing.
[18862.40s -> 18878.11s]  All right.
[18878.11s -> 18879.39s]  Don't use the speed unless I need it.
[18880.43s -> 18909.53s]  All right.
[18909.53s -> 18910.81s]  Only one more.
[18910.81s -> 18911.37s]  That should be it.
[18912.09s -> 18914.49s]  More good one.
[18921.10s -> 18925.10s]  This should be it.
[18926.62s -> 18927.02s]  Come on.
[18927.98s -> 18930.04s]  Come on.
[18930.04s -> 18930.68s]  Ah.
[18930.68s -> 18931.72s]  Needs like one more.
[18968.76s -> 18969.08s]  Good.
[18969.64s -> 18972.46s]  I'm losing frames here.
[18972.46s -> 18973.50s]  It doesn't count.
[18973.50s -> 18975.74s]  We're at like 14 frames a second.
[18976.38s -> 18984.08s]  All right.
[18984.08s -> 18994.91s]  Did I win?
[18995.63s -> 19011.12s]  Is the QTE the same button?
[19013.31s -> 19014.27s]  It's usually Y.
[19014.91s -> 19015.15s]  Yeah.
[19016.27s -> 19025.64s]  I hope he keeps devolving.
[19027.92s -> 19028.32s]  Yeah.
[19028.32s -> 19028.56s]  Okay.
[19028.56s -> 19030.00s]  Are we going to get another form?
[19030.72s -> 19033.60s]  Can he just be like a puddle of mud or something with like two fingers?
[19037.87s -> 19041.23s]  I should dispose of him where he stands.
[19042.19s -> 19044.43s]  My soul tells me different.
[19047.61s -> 19048.97s]  Screams to me.
[19048.97s -> 19050.25s]  He's too angry to die.
[19051.13s -> 19052.01s]  Let him die.
[19053.95s -> 19064.28s]  For a reason.
[19064.28s -> 19065.64s]  Then listen to my fists.
[19072.16s -> 19073.20s]  How many times are we going to do that?
[19074.48s -> 19077.68s]  You'd think you'd punch with the other hand by now.
[19085.53s -> 19086.41s]  Civil War.
[19090.12s -> 19092.20s]  That really was Civil War.
[19092.28s -> 19094.80s]  I have business in Shinto.
[19096.84s -> 19097.72s]  Why is it normal now?
[19099.37s -> 19100.73s]  Wait for my return.
[19116.11s -> 19117.23s]  Dead for the fourth time.
[19117.23s -> 19121.66s]  Number four.
[19121.66s -> 19124.06s]  Hope we appear back on that pillar to climb.
[19124.70s -> 19126.86s]  I am Yasha of the Seven Deities.
[19133.56s -> 19134.12s]  Corvette.
[19163.40s -> 19164.52s]  There's a 15.
[19164.52s -> 19168.36s]  Two more episodes remain until we get the final story.
[19168.92s -> 19192.22s]  Comes episode 16.
[19192.22s -> 19192.54s]  Oh look.
[19192.54s -> 19194.06s]  It's Jerma's grade in college.
[19195.02s -> 19199.24s]  I don't remember that.
[19199.24s -> 19202.40s]  It said P-break.
[19202.40s -> 19202.72s]  Yeah.
[19202.72s -> 19203.44s]  No, don't worry.
[19203.92s -> 19204.40s]  We will.
[19205.55s -> 19207.79s]  Thousands of years ago in Deus's office.
[19208.75s -> 19209.87s]  Yasha, we decided.
[19211.39s -> 19212.19s]  Why are you so hesitant?
[19212.19s -> 19214.35s]  It's the only way we can save this accursed planet.
[19214.35s -> 19218.03s]  But to kill a few to save the many, I do not feel that would be just.
[19218.03s -> 19219.23s]  This has nothing to do with justice.
[19219.23s -> 19220.03s]  It is our cause.
[19220.83s -> 19222.03s]  What do you mean saving our way of life?
[19222.03s -> 19223.55s]  I would gladly accept becoming a demon.
[19224.43s -> 19227.90s]  That's what it takes to attain an eternity of peace and prosperity for our people.
[19228.62s -> 19235.07s]  A village with no name.
[19236.36s -> 19237.24s]  Great guardian.
[19237.24s -> 19238.52s]  Why do the Goma exist?
[19238.52s -> 19240.12s]  Why do they come and take everything from us?
[19240.76s -> 19243.96s]  Well, my lord, my son's death was not in vain, was it?
[19243.96s -> 19244.68s]  No, it was not.
[19244.68s -> 19246.52s]  We would have been powerless without his prayers.
[19247.24s -> 19248.08s]  I see.
[19248.08s -> 19250.24s]  Thank goodness, son, your death was not in vain.
[19251.04s -> 19253.20s]  But I wish you could have lived to see a world of peace.
[19253.20s -> 19256.00s]  Let us meet again one day when you are reborn in a different life.
[19256.96s -> 19264.67s]  It is his office.
[19265.39s -> 19269.08s]  Well, I've seen so much pain and suffering of our people throughout this internal war.
[19269.08s -> 19271.64s]  If you say we can stop this, then I am at your command.
[19271.64s -> 19272.92s]  I too shall become a demon.
[19273.72s -> 19274.78s]  You made the right choice.
[19274.78s -> 19276.54s]  I'm confident you will make me very proud.
[19277.26s -> 19280.14s]  From this day forth, I shall live only for the cause.
[19281.02s -> 19284.36s]  Until I fly away in a corvette.
[19286.11s -> 19286.83s]  All right, pee break.
[19287.47s -> 19288.67s]  And then we'll get into the end here.
[19291.64s -> 19426.59s]  All right.
[19426.59s -> 19430.19s]  I don't know if this is gonna sound weird, Mike, but my room smells like chocolate.
[19431.39s -> 19433.44s]  For some reason.
[19433.44s -> 19435.50s]  It smells like chocolate in here.
[19461.10s -> 19462.14s]  Will we be back here again?
[19468.76s -> 19484.80s]  We the seven deities have finally brought stability and all this anger inside of me.
[19485.60s -> 19487.04s]  I don't fight for good.
[19488.08s -> 19489.44s]  And I don't fight for evil.
[19490.24s -> 19491.44s]  I just fight.
[19491.44s -> 19493.12s]  I will say it once more.
[19494.40s -> 19496.96s]  I am you and you are me.
[19502.51s -> 19504.19s]  I'm leaning back in my chair right now.
[19506.99s -> 19507.87s]  Take a look at this.
[19507.95s -> 19509.79s]  This is a new new mic sound, right?
[19510.35s -> 19511.31s]  Yes.
[19511.31s -> 19514.51s]  The source of your power is your fan.
[19514.51s -> 19518.67s]  If you're so powerful, it could scorch your very body.
[19518.67s -> 19523.16s]  Unleash your rage and let your arm do the rest.
[19523.16s -> 19523.90s]  Yes.
[19525.00s -> 19534.14s]  Give in to the fear.
[19534.14s -> 19534.78s]  Spider.
[19534.78s -> 19537.58s]  I will lose myself again.
[19537.58s -> 19538.22s]  Spider.
[19538.22s -> 19542.54s]  You have extraordinary power, sir.
[19542.54s -> 19544.94s]  It's the power that cannot protect anything.
[19544.94s -> 19546.30s]  He's giving birth.
[19547.61s -> 19548.25s]  Yes, it can.
[19549.05s -> 19551.13s]  It can save the world.
[19552.33s -> 19553.85s]  Save the world.
[19553.85s -> 19557.96s]  This power is ridiculous.
[19557.96s -> 19558.46s]  Oh.
[19566.68s -> 19567.18s]  All right.
[19572.32s -> 19590.85s]  Okay.
[19591.31s -> 19593.07s]  You just have to go over there.
[19595.66s -> 19597.98s]  Exact same thing happens in the Fall Metal Alchemist intro.
[19597.98s -> 19601.34s]  I will let you take any more lives.
[19601.34s -> 19602.38s]  Exact same thing.
[19603.10s -> 19612.43s]  How would you know?
[19612.43s -> 19613.07s]  Because I've seen it.
[19613.71s -> 19623.90s]  I swear to God, watching anime for some of you guys is the equivalent
[19623.90s -> 19626.94s]  of me like snorting coke before I scream.
[19627.58s -> 19627.98s]  But you...
[19628.94s -> 19629.74s]  Did you get that?
[19631.61s -> 19632.41s]  Should you have done that?
[19636.94s -> 19639.02s]  Snorting anime before the stream turns on.
[19641.85s -> 19644.78s]  Snap, I've seen a couple, but it's not a big deal.
[19668.86s -> 19669.58s]  Look, they'll scream.
[19670.78s -> 19680.06s]  Oh, that was right in the face.
[19681.26s -> 19689.64s]  Come on.
[19689.64s -> 19694.52s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[19694.52s -> 19695.56s]  Walk onto him.
[19695.56s -> 19696.76s]  Why would you walk onto that guy?
[19697.40s -> 19699.08s]  Why would you walk onto the guy back here?
[19699.96s -> 19701.08s]  What do you think of him?
[19701.16s -> 19702.60s]  Why would you do something like that?
[19716.06s -> 19716.38s]  More?
[19716.94s -> 19718.94s]  Ooh, that daggers it up.
[19719.98s -> 19721.02s]  I actually have to sit up.
[19736.99s -> 19740.65s]  Come on again.
[19741.29s -> 19750.43s]  Thanks for the help.
[19753.61s -> 19757.12s]  Oh, this area sucks.
[19767.85s -> 19770.89s]  Ah, yai.
[19770.89s -> 19772.76s]  This place sucks.
[19786.01s -> 19787.13s]  I'm not even going to walk onto him.
[19787.13s -> 19789.77s]  Stop telling me in the story I was going right at the beginning of the stream.
[19791.77s -> 19792.73s]  It just rips around.
[19793.69s -> 19798.84s]  Now I walk onto him.
[19798.84s -> 19799.16s]  No.
[19799.16s -> 19800.60s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[19801.72s -> 19805.90s]  Hey, you know the guy that's in front of me?
[19811.66s -> 19815.55s]  Just kill me.
[19815.55s -> 19816.35s]  Just fucking kill me.
[19822.96s -> 19824.56s]  This has to last like five waves.
[19826.76s -> 19838.25s]  Because that guy can't believe he just got a kill.
[19838.25s -> 19840.92s]  Oh my god, I actually did it.
[19841.56s -> 19843.64s]  I shot my little fucking peepee gun at him.
[19843.64s -> 19845.16s]  Whoa, he died from that.
[19845.16s -> 19846.12s]  That's unbelievable.
[19846.86s -> 19848.22s]  Never happened before, ever to me.
[19866.19s -> 19868.11s]  How do- you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[19869.07s -> 19870.59s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[19870.59s -> 19871.47s]  Get out of here.
[19872.27s -> 19880.30s]  I'm gonna fucking smash the Xbox.
[19882.60s -> 19893.87s]  I'm gonna hit him in the ear.
[19938.40s -> 19939.52s]  I'm fucking dead.
[19947.61s -> 19948.81s]  This is unbelievable.
[19948.81s -> 19971.07s]  All right, here comes the worst part.
[19971.07s -> 19972.11s]  This is gonna be the worst part.
[19973.24s -> 19973.72s]  Use burst?
[19973.72s -> 19974.20s]  I don't have it.
[19977.40s -> 19978.68s]  Burst is the way to beat the level.
[19979.32s -> 19981.63s]  All right, I gotta clear out the little guys first.
[20020.33s -> 20034.72s]  Hi.
[20035.44s -> 20036.48s]  Hey, let's fight now, please.
[20037.52s -> 20038.56s]  I'd love to-
[20040.08s -> 20044.59s]  Stop pretending.
[20044.59s -> 20046.83s]  Dude, I gotta fucking pretend for views, man.
[20047.71s -> 20048.19s]  Come on.
[20048.19s -> 20048.75s]  What are you doing?
[20048.75s -> 20049.07s]  Get it?
[20051.58s -> 20052.22s]  I've got to.
[20053.66s -> 20059.44s]  How are people gonna watch if I don't get hit three times and die by 10 people surrounding me
[20060.16s -> 20070.73s]  without a block?
[20091.26s -> 20092.94s]  Imagine blocking in an action game.
[20093.58s -> 20098.38s]  It's just stuff with 10 people on the screen around you in a circle and the lock-on sucks.
[20099.26s -> 20101.58s]  All right, just do it again, do it again, do it again.
[20103.02s -> 20112.25s]  The best part about playing an action game,
[20112.25s -> 20116.25s]  when you fucking stand still and nobody will touch you,
[20116.25s -> 20118.97s]  it's like they know that you're not moving around.
[20118.97s -> 20121.05s]  No one's even trying to hurt me right now.
[20121.05s -> 20121.85s]  Why does this happen?
[20123.66s -> 20125.50s]  Well, I've decided I will attack you now.
[20127.34s -> 20130.30s]  I waited 15 full seconds to do anything.
[20133.15s -> 20135.07s]  When you actually are trying to beat the game,
[20136.73s -> 20145.85s]  I've turned it on times a thousand.
[20145.85s -> 20148.09s]  Jack isn't doing anything, like this is on target.
[20148.09s -> 20148.81s]  Just fucking kill me.
[20160.80s -> 20162.08s]  I was gonna say you almost missed.
[20164.40s -> 20166.32s]  He's mauling at a cutscene game.
[20169.34s -> 20170.70s]  All right, this is the one, this is the one,
[20170.70s -> 20171.50s]  this is the one, this is the one.
[20172.62s -> 20174.62s]  But I didn't even have time to react.
[20174.62s -> 20179.64s]  I'm stupid, I'm stupid.
[20193.39s -> 20194.91s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[20200.64s -> 20201.52s]  What the fuck?
[20202.91s -> 20213.77s]  I'm not walking onto anybody, I can't.
[20240.89s -> 20244.33s]  No, that's not the guy I wanted to walk onto.
[20245.29s -> 20248.81s]  What, who do you think I was trying to target?
[20250.33s -> 20254.09s]  It's not the person I was trying to target.
[20255.13s -> 20256.65s]  I'm glad he's dead anyways.
[20280.68s -> 20283.72s]  Fuck man, these guys still behind me.
[20283.72s -> 20284.84s]  Where did he even come from?
[20286.68s -> 20293.18s]  All right, I can make this count.
[20318.33s -> 20320.49s]  What the fuck is happening right now?
[20320.49s -> 20327.98s]  I can't, these people are fucking freaking me out.
[20330.16s -> 20331.20s]  Jesus Christ.
[20343.95s -> 20344.43s]  No, don't.
[20355.72s -> 20363.00s]  Do something, do something, do something, do something.
[20380.44s -> 20380.92s]  Thank God.
[20398.76s -> 20403.07s]  Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[20403.07s -> 20403.87s]  I got a fucking idea.
[20403.87s -> 20404.91s]  Here's my idea, this is it.
[20404.91s -> 20407.71s]  I'm fine.
[20419.15s -> 20419.39s]  Dead?
[20425.26s -> 20427.45s]  That was horrible.
[20428.09s -> 20428.81s]  That was painful.
[20429.37s -> 20430.41s]  That hurt.
[20430.41s -> 20433.21s]  It was a quality tuber noises.
[20433.21s -> 20433.85s]  Yeah, I know, dude.
[20433.85s -> 20435.45s]  Imagine that in a fucking compilation.
[20447.66s -> 20449.50s]  No, it's probably gonna get harder.
[20490.78s -> 20491.58s]  All right.
[20493.90s -> 20496.14s]  Good, get me out, get me out.
[20496.78s -> 20497.34s]  How do I get out?
[20498.06s -> 20502.89s]  What's going on?
[20506.51s -> 20507.55s]  This guy's fucking up the door.
[20516.36s -> 20517.88s]  Okay, let's go.
[20521.66s -> 20524.30s]  This just got, this game just got like 5,000 times harder.
[20550.72s -> 20551.36s]  It's a good grab.
[20558.24s -> 20582.83s]  Great, he's getting angry again.
[20584.43s -> 20588.62s]  Last time he did was he turned into a goblin.
[20589.82s -> 20605.77s]  I don't get it, but he's connected to the girl so I can't kill him.
[20606.33s -> 20611.34s]  It's one of those slime hands you get as a kid.
[20612.06s -> 20614.62s]  From like the 50 cent machine, the little gumball machine.
[20616.78s -> 20619.02s]  That was a sick stock electricity sound.
[20619.02s -> 20619.90s]  I can probably find that right now.
[20621.42s -> 20629.77s]  What's that for?
[20632.00s -> 20632.64s]  It's mine.
[20635.64s -> 20637.00s]  Stay out of my way.
[20640.20s -> 20646.20s]  You want to fight?
[20646.20s -> 20646.68s]  No, I got it.
[20655.74s -> 20658.14s]  It's required to save the world.
[20658.14s -> 20660.03s]  Are we gonna do two on one here?
[20660.03s -> 20667.64s]  I will show you how useless that cure is.
[20667.64s -> 20668.14s]  Let's go.
[20669.00s -> 20676.48s]  But blinded by your own bringing salvation to guide.
[20676.48s -> 20678.08s]  It becomes a triple threat match.
[20679.04s -> 20685.10s]  I'm gonna save the world.
[20685.10s -> 20694.81s]  This hell will finally end.
[20694.81s -> 20699.37s]  I'm powering up too close.
[20707.26s -> 20708.06s]  How many arms do I get?
[20709.58s -> 20710.86s]  Do I get more than six?
[20734.20s -> 20738.83s]  Watch out for the electricity.
[20739.95s -> 20740.91s]  Shitload of electricity.
[20741.79s -> 20744.03s]  Drive iframes.
[20747.76s -> 20756.88s]  Go, go, go, double team.
[20761.02s -> 20761.52s]  Ow, fuck.
[20767.39s -> 20767.89s]  Nice.
[20769.23s -> 20770.83s]  Hey, I'm walking far away.
[20775.80s -> 20777.24s]  That's what I like to see, the good double.
[20778.20s -> 20779.80s]  We will shoot at the same time.
[20783.37s -> 20784.09s]  Oh, shit.
[20785.61s -> 20787.93s]  I don't have any power.
[20787.93s -> 20789.13s]  All right, I gotta be careful here.
[20804.35s -> 20809.12s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, hurry, hurry.
[20814.92s -> 20815.96s]  Hey, hey, huh?
[20816.60s -> 20817.24s]  What was that?
[20818.57s -> 20819.61s]  Okay, wait a minute.
[20819.61s -> 20822.25s]  That didn't, I didn't even get a tenth of a second to do that last one.
[20825.28s -> 20825.78s]  Bullshit.
[20826.40s -> 20852.30s]  All right, get in there, let's go.
[20852.94s -> 20853.74s]  Start attacking them.
[20854.46s -> 20856.94s]  Get in there.
[20878.75s -> 20879.63s]  All right, what was there?
[20884.84s -> 20885.34s]  Shit.
[20885.96s -> 20886.60s]  Oh, shit.
[20888.11s -> 20888.67s]  Oh, shit.
[20889.47s -> 20891.15s]  Oh, no.
[20891.15s -> 20892.83s]  Oh, I just had it off timing.
[20892.83s -> 20895.90s]  Ah, I had it off timed.
[20896.54s -> 20897.96s]  All right, I know what he does now.
[20921.02s -> 20921.82s]  When you get close enough,
[20921.82s -> 20922.86s]  you're gonna be fucking careful.
[20922.86s -> 20926.56s]  He does that shit.
[20927.20s -> 20928.96s]  Oh, come on.
[20928.96s -> 20930.24s]  I thought I was out of the range.
[20930.24s -> 20931.04s]  Give me a break, game.
[20937.26s -> 20937.90s]  Get in here.
[20939.10s -> 20941.04s]  This dude isn't doing anything.
[20941.04s -> 20942.16s]  He usually helps.
[20942.16s -> 20943.74s]  Not this time, apparently.
[20952.73s -> 20954.57s]  The other dude didn't do shit this time.
[20955.13s -> 20956.65s]  He just, he's supposed to help me.
[20957.45s -> 20980.56s]  He just has to act to every sound.
[20980.56s -> 20982.00s]  My god, Jesus.
[20983.76s -> 20999.10s]  Good job.
[20999.10s -> 21000.14s]  Good job, you keep missing.
[21001.02s -> 21016.72s]  He has to do the big stomp thing.
[21032.41s -> 21033.21s]  What the fuck?
[21037.71s -> 21045.64s]  Why do the cameras grip around like that?
[21045.64s -> 21046.14s]  Okay.
[21052.78s -> 21053.82s]  This camera's giving me a headache.
[21054.54s -> 21058.76s]  I'm not even locked onto him.
[21058.76s -> 21060.12s]  We're just like ripping around
[21060.12s -> 21061.16s]  when he dashes forward.
[21073.24s -> 21075.16s]  Yeah, it's two guys versus a fucking hacker.
[21075.88s -> 21095.15s]  He goes that far?
[21095.15s -> 21097.55s]  I thought it didn't go that far.
[21097.55s -> 21098.83s]  I can't even, man.
[21110.80s -> 21111.30s]  Please.
[21112.16s -> 21113.92s]  He's giving me fucking diarrhea.
[21116.83s -> 21123.00s]  All right, I think I got it for free.
[21125.08s -> 21134.84s]  This is too much stimulation right now.
[21151.79s -> 21152.67s]  Fuck this guy.
[21153.39s -> 21157.66s]  It's just flashing lights.
[21160.73s -> 21161.93s]  Get out of here, please.
[21161.93s -> 21162.65s]  Just kill him.
[21162.65s -> 21163.53s]  Help me fight him.
[21166.80s -> 21167.92s]  Thanks a lot, idiot.
[21167.92s -> 21168.88s]  He just ruined it.
[21168.88s -> 21170.08s]  I was doing my move here.
[21176.96s -> 21178.56s]  As he just squints the boss fight.
[21180.72s -> 21199.45s]  I jumped.
[21199.45s -> 21200.33s]  I jumped.
[21200.33s -> 21200.73s]  I jumped.
[21200.73s -> 21201.21s]  What happened?
[21205.18s -> 21205.68s]  What?
[21206.54s -> 21207.58s]  I jumped over that.
[21212.80s -> 21215.95s]  And this guy has a run of fucking mana.
[21216.59s -> 21217.55s]  This is bullshit.
[21239.42s -> 21240.46s]  Where is he?
[21240.46s -> 21241.10s]  Come on.
[21241.10s -> 21241.82s]  We're almost there.
[21243.88s -> 21244.76s]  You and me.
[21244.76s -> 21256.27s]  We call him again.
[21256.27s -> 21266.22s]  Not you.
[21266.22s -> 21280.08s]  Get him.
[21280.62s -> 21281.12s]  More.
[21282.84s -> 21283.34s]  More.
[21291.26s -> 21291.66s]  Get in.
[21291.66s -> 21291.98s]  Go.
[21291.98s -> 21292.48s]  Go.
[21293.08s -> 21293.40s]  Get him.
[21293.40s -> 21293.88s]  Get him.
[21293.88s -> 21294.12s]  Get him.
[21294.12s -> 21294.68s]  He's on the ground.
[21295.32s -> 21295.82s]  No.
[21303.24s -> 21303.56s]  Get him.
[21303.56s -> 21304.06s]  Get him.
[21304.68s -> 21305.48s]  I don't know what he's doing.
[21306.04s -> 21306.28s]  What?
[21306.28s -> 21306.84s]  Did I beat him?
[21307.48s -> 21309.79s]  I lost.
[21309.79s -> 21314.48s]  Oh my fucking God.
[21315.82s -> 21316.78s]  Stop rushing.
[21316.78s -> 21318.38s]  I can't attack him unless I get in close
[21318.38s -> 21319.50s]  because the only way I can attack him.
[21320.91s -> 21322.19s]  I have to get in close.
[21322.19s -> 21325.15s]  Otherwise, he just keeps doing the hurt your eyes move.
[21325.95s -> 21327.52s]  He's gonna do this forever.
[21328.40s -> 21335.26s]  The only way I can attack him is if I get in close.
[21335.26s -> 21349.28s]  I had it there, but instead of dodging,
[21349.28s -> 21350.32s]  I tried that before I get in close.
[21351.28s -> 21352.40s]  I can only jump over that one.
[21352.40s -> 21354.08s]  I can dodge through the...
[21354.08s -> 21356.32s]  I can only jump over the circle on the ground.
[21356.32s -> 21356.64s]  See?
[21356.64s -> 21357.14s]  Look.
[21359.76s -> 21360.26s]  Look.
[21360.64s -> 21366.49s]  Three people telling me to jump.
[21390.33s -> 21391.77s]  I had like 30% health.
[21391.77s -> 21392.33s]  I'm not gonna just...
[21393.05s -> 21393.93s]  I need full health.
[21404.51s -> 21405.95s]  I need full health.
[21405.95s -> 21416.24s]  It wasn't paying attention.
[21416.24s -> 21416.80s]  Idiot.
[21416.80s -> 21429.39s]  It was three people that told me to jump.
[21429.39s -> 21430.75s]  It's faster than dodging.
[21430.75s -> 21431.23s]  Thanks, guys.
[21446.22s -> 21446.62s]  No, really.
[21446.62s -> 21447.02s]  Thanks.
[21447.02s -> 21447.58s]  Like, I wouldn't...
[21447.58s -> 21448.30s]  I would have been like,
[21448.30s -> 21449.18s]  what the fuck are they talking about?
[21449.18s -> 21449.42s]  What the fuck?
[21449.42s -> 21450.62s]  Are they fucking stupid?
[21452.14s -> 21456.49s]  That was like $6,000.
[21457.53s -> 21464.12s]  What's the point of a dodge roll?
[21465.00s -> 21469.85s]  What's the point of a dodge roll?
[21469.85s -> 21470.81s]  Why is there a dodge roll?
[21471.53s -> 21498.22s]  I just parked him.
[21501.60s -> 21502.32s]  I just parked him.
[21506.00s -> 21506.88s]  What the...
[21507.76s -> 21510.51s]  Oops.
[21528.96s -> 21529.46s]  It's over.
[21530.56s -> 21531.37s]  Wait.
[21531.37s -> 21532.33s]  That's not part of the video.
[21533.37s -> 21564.60s]  Not that I don't even care.
[21590.49s -> 21591.93s]  I seem to like to do this to people.
[21594.49s -> 21596.57s]  I like to lift them up and let them talk.
[21596.57s -> 21597.13s]  Or their neck.
[21616.76s -> 21617.40s]  Behold.
[21618.36s -> 21620.28s]  This is that very power.
[21621.00s -> 21626.09s]  Wait, is this supposed to be him?
[21642.06s -> 21644.30s]  We have to fight the galaxy brain guy?
[21648.88s -> 21650.64s]  I don't know why that's making me laugh.
[21658.12s -> 21660.60s]  Galaxy brain.
[21660.60s -> 21665.90s]  I'm stupid.
[21669.88s -> 21672.68s]  Sakura Geninam Indra Deus.
[21677.88s -> 21681.28s]  Destiny, it is me.
[21684.54s -> 21687.28s]  Okay.
[21690.86s -> 21701.61s]  It doesn't matter how big you get.
[21701.61s -> 21702.41s]  You can just see that.
[21703.21s -> 21705.45s]  Well, we finally agree.
[21706.65s -> 21708.17s]  That doesn't make us friends.
[21708.81s -> 21709.61s]  Of course not.
[21710.73s -> 21712.70s]  Still, Deus.
[21713.66s -> 21715.66s]  So, this is your decision.
[21716.62s -> 21717.34s]  But this is...
[21719.10s -> 21721.18s]  Now stop talking to yourself.
[21722.22s -> 21723.02s]  Asura, you...
[21724.20s -> 21728.28s]  With a target that big, we can't miss.
[21729.00s -> 21731.18s]  Always dwelling on the fight.
[21731.98s -> 21732.62s]  Very well.
[21735.28s -> 21738.80s]  What is he doing?
[21738.80s -> 21739.28s]  Oh, he's...
[21740.00s -> 21741.12s]  Right, he's hauling his car.
[21749.21s -> 21751.55s]  Who said you could board?
[21752.19s -> 21754.27s]  You and I will settle this later.
[21754.91s -> 21756.17s]  But how was I going to get there?
[21756.17s -> 21757.13s]  You'll fly.
[21757.13s -> 21759.87s]  Do not blame me if you fall off.
[21759.87s -> 21760.75s]  How was I going to get there?
[21762.59s -> 21765.00s]  Oh, we're going to have to deal with...
[21765.00s -> 21765.72s]  We're going to have to do the...
[21766.76s -> 21768.60s]  Walk on and shoot enemies for an episode.
[21769.72s -> 21817.37s]  It is a little bit 18 up to date.
[21817.37s -> 21819.31s]  Are we about to beat the...
[21819.31s -> 21821.47s]  Are we about to fight the final boss?
[21822.99s -> 21823.95s]  Of course.
[21823.95s -> 21824.45s]  Whatever.
[21825.55s -> 21827.90s]  Grenade up his nose or something.
[21827.90s -> 21828.78s]  Or whatever I'm going to do here.
[21871.66s -> 21872.30s]  Still going?
[21873.02s -> 21885.56s]  Or get too full of moves?
[21886.44s -> 21893.66s]  I mean, this is cool.
[21894.46s -> 21895.02s]  It's cool.
[21896.22s -> 21897.66s]  But I'm not really doing it.
[21906.56s -> 21925.68s]  Good.
[21925.68s -> 21938.67s]  Dumbass is wasting your wing points.
[21960.32s -> 21960.82s]  More?
[21962.00s -> 21990.77s]  Tilted?
[21998.65s -> 22001.29s]  A thousand years for a gigantic toy.
[22003.45s -> 22005.29s]  That's definitely better than a toy.
[22007.40s -> 22009.37s]  It's like the king of all cosmos.
[22019.21s -> 22025.05s]  He's clapping us.
[22025.05s -> 22025.77s]  He's clapping us.
[22026.49s -> 22028.17s]  He's going to squish us together in his palms.
[22028.89s -> 22035.37s]  Why not?
[22035.37s -> 22036.82s]  Pray?
[22050.09s -> 22050.77s]  Did he get us?
[22058.57s -> 22059.29s]  Nope.
[22059.29s -> 22059.79s]  Maybe.
[22060.49s -> 22060.99s]  You'll see.
[22062.17s -> 22079.72s]  Design?
[22079.72s -> 22082.68s]  Yeah, that big guy is pretty cool.
[22082.68s -> 22083.48s]  Pretty cool.
[22083.80s -> 22084.36s]  I will say.
[22085.08s -> 22090.35s]  Here goes 17.
[22093.96s -> 22095.08s]  Aliyoth on the bridge.
[22095.80s -> 22098.20s]  Ah, sakra, davanam, indra, deus.
[22098.20s -> 22100.12s]  I cannot believe I'm seeing it with my own eyes.
[22100.12s -> 22101.16s]  It's magnificent.
[22101.16s -> 22103.64s]  Not even the colossi compared to its power.
[22103.64s -> 22105.08s]  By merging with the karma fortress,
[22105.08s -> 22107.08s]  it has become the most powerful being in existence.
[22107.96s -> 22110.04s]  It'll purify Goma Viltra.
[22110.04s -> 22111.72s]  With the use of the priestess's power
[22111.72s -> 22114.04s]  and the seven trillion souls we have accumulated.
[22114.04s -> 22115.16s]  There's a lot of people on Earth.
[22118.11s -> 22119.07s]  That's a lot.
[22119.71s -> 22120.21s]  That's...
[22120.67s -> 22122.11s]  Seems like too many people on Earth.
[22123.40s -> 22125.88s]  But would that not also destroy the planet as well?
[22125.88s -> 22127.16s]  Seven trillion people?
[22129.52s -> 22131.52s]  Perhaps it was just the brahmastra.
[22132.54s -> 22134.86s]  Now that lord deus is merged with the karma fortress,
[22134.86s -> 22137.74s]  he can concentrate blast with great precision.
[22138.62s -> 22141.44s]  Sakra, davanam, indra, deus is invincible.
[22142.48s -> 22143.12s]  Lots of fun.
[22143.76s -> 22144.26s]  Laugh.
[22151.44s -> 22153.36s]  They've been farming the planet for 12,000 years.
[22154.24s -> 22155.76s]  Yeah, but haven't we been...
[22156.64s -> 22158.48s]  Aren't we under the knowledge that they've been using it?
[22159.68s -> 22162.96s]  Like cast spells and throw parties and stuff
[22162.96s -> 22165.92s]  and have power and do stuff and destroy things, right?
[22165.92s -> 22166.96s]  They've been using it, haven't they?
[22177.04s -> 22190.51s]  Episode 17, fleet of play.
[22202.12s -> 22206.70s]  We crashed!
[22208.78s -> 22211.13s]  We gotta kill his heart now!
[22224.80s -> 22225.44s]  Why is it...
[22225.44s -> 22227.20s]  I don't know why that's making me laugh tonight.
[22228.24s -> 22229.44s]  Why is that doing that?
[22229.44s -> 22231.04s]  I don't know why I think that's funny today.
[22233.58s -> 22234.22s]  Sorry.
[22234.22s -> 22235.34s]  No, who cares?
[22235.34s -> 22236.30s]  Fuck that.
[22236.30s -> 22236.86s]  I'm not sorry.
[22238.94s -> 22240.59s]  I'm sorry!
[22241.47s -> 22245.98s]  It's probably Mr. Apology now because of the ayaya.
[22247.02s -> 22252.56s]  Now I think if I eat like peanut butter and jelly
[22252.56s -> 22255.04s]  with like the peanut butter on the top instead of the bottom,
[22255.04s -> 22256.72s]  I gotta have to apologize to you guys for that.
[22257.68s -> 22259.37s]  Oh, dance game?
[22259.37s -> 22260.57s]  You don't do jelly on top?
[22260.57s -> 22261.07s]  I'm sorry.
[22261.93s -> 22283.86s]  Open it!
[22297.28s -> 22298.24s]  Sonic Adventure 2.
[22299.12s -> 22300.32s]  Tails mechanic.
[22301.12s -> 22303.15s]  I actually have to control this shit.
[22303.79s -> 22306.67s]  This is the reactor that turns the souls into mantra.
[22307.55s -> 22310.83s]  If we destroy it, it will cut off Deus's energy supply.
[22319.24s -> 22320.36s]  Wait, should I be breaking these?
[22321.64s -> 22324.40s]  I can't break them.
[22325.04s -> 22332.04s]  I'm just trying to talk.
[22332.04s -> 22334.12s]  I can't not hear anything you say.
[22335.08s -> 22341.76s]  Sorry, I can't hear you.
[22341.76s -> 22343.28s]  I'm destroying all the capsules.
[22366.16s -> 22383.60s]  What?
[22384.14s -> 22385.87s]  That's not fair.
[22386.67s -> 22387.47s]  There's no opening.
[22392.64s -> 22404.44s]  I'm getting it.
[22404.44s -> 22404.92s]  Great.
[22404.92s -> 22406.68s]  I'm going through it.
[22406.68s -> 22412.52s]  Okay, you know there's a problem when Aladdin the Super Nintendo
[22412.52s -> 22413.80s]  didn't do that.
[22413.80s -> 22414.52s]  There's an issue here.
[22424.09s -> 22429.82s]  Fire now.
[22430.68s -> 22459.40s]  These lasers are terrible.
[22460.60s -> 22462.92s]  Look at how bad these lasers are.
[22462.92s -> 22465.55s]  You don't have a laser that can shoot forward.
[22467.44s -> 22471.76s]  It's just arched up and down left and right while you just shoot it.
[22474.94s -> 22477.26s]  I'm getting real sick of the zooming on the face
[22477.26s -> 22478.22s]  and then hit Y.
[22478.22s -> 22479.42s]  It's happened a hundred times.
[22480.38s -> 22482.14s]  It's happened a hundred times.
[22485.85s -> 22505.86s]  Hurry.
[22509.95s -> 22514.65s]  Jerma hates the game.
[22514.65s -> 22515.85s]  Feels bad, man.
[22516.65s -> 22518.78s]  No, I'm fine.
[22518.78s -> 22538.80s]  This game would be so much better if his other four hands
[22539.44s -> 22541.44s]  turned into mouths and talked.
[22542.32s -> 22544.80s]  They'll like, they'll be fun.
[22546.56s -> 22549.28s]  They talk to each other and shit and turned and it was like the mouth hand.
[22549.84s -> 22551.92s]  That'd be awesome.
[22551.92s -> 22556.60s]  I do understand.
[22557.16s -> 22560.11s]  I must do what I think is right.
[22562.56s -> 22564.56s]  I am the god that carries the fate of civilization on his shoulders.
[22564.56s -> 22565.84s]  I'm talking about like his puppet.
[22566.48s -> 22567.60s]  His hands are puppets.
[22568.96s -> 22571.60s]  And they talk and they have different personalities and shit.
[22572.00s -> 22574.80s]  You are a danger to my words.
[22574.80s -> 22577.28s]  Consider your lies, puppet.
[22577.28s -> 22577.78s]  What?
[22578.96s -> 22580.08s]  He's actually crazy.
[22581.20s -> 22581.84s]  What do you mean?
[22581.84s -> 22582.34s]  What?
[22612.27s -> 22623.34s]  Back up, back up, back up.
[22623.34s -> 22623.90s]  What's he doing?
[22631.28s -> 22631.78s]  Oh!
[22632.40s -> 22643.50s]  Is it the same boss?
[22643.50s -> 22644.00s]  I think so.
[22647.29s -> 22663.21s]  I'm distracting him.
[22663.21s -> 22663.71s]  Hit him.
[22664.11s -> 22665.07s]  Hit him, hit him.
[22665.07s -> 22665.57s]  Nice job.
[22666.27s -> 22666.95s]  All right, get in.
[22667.57s -> 22669.15s]  That's what we call teamwork.
[22670.43s -> 22683.27s]  Get in.
[22687.30s -> 22688.02s]  Oh shit.
[22688.58s -> 22694.69s]  No, get in.
[22696.67s -> 22697.17s]  Get in.
[22697.31s -> 22698.51s]  One of us can distract him.
[22699.31s -> 22712.94s]  Wait, don't get it.
[22713.58s -> 22718.77s]  Just call, just call, get in.
[22718.77s -> 22738.78s]  Get in, good.
[22738.78s -> 22740.48s]  Oh, now it's just one v one.
[22740.48s -> 22741.52s]  God damn it.
[22741.52s -> 22742.64s]  We can't co-op him anymore.
[22750.77s -> 22751.27s]  Jesus.
[22751.81s -> 22765.01s]  See what to do here.
[22765.01s -> 22767.01s]  I don't know what to do.
[22767.01s -> 22774.42s]  I can't get this.
[22778.99s -> 22786.37s]  It was slow.
[22786.37s -> 22791.23s]  Man, that move sucks.
[22792.11s -> 22793.31s]  So I don't know what he's going to do with it.
[22811.60s -> 22812.40s]  Jesus, man.
[22812.40s -> 22814.40s]  Give me an opportunity.
[22814.40s -> 22829.03s]  Don't die.
[22850.32s -> 22850.82s]  What?
[22856.13s -> 22856.63s]  What happened?
[22862.72s -> 22864.32s]  We were doing a, we were about to do a
[22865.12s -> 22866.56s]  TTE.
[22866.62s -> 22867.12s]  It didn't.
[22867.98s -> 22871.58s]  Okay, let's go.
[22872.22s -> 22873.42s]  I know what someone was moving up.
[22878.05s -> 22883.74s]  I'll get him.
[22883.74s -> 22885.70s]  Done.
[22892.61s -> 22899.11s]  Stupid.
[22903.90s -> 22904.40s]  Damn it.
[22904.40s -> 22905.34s]  I thought he was doing the jump thing.
[22921.52s -> 22926.64s]  We haven't grabbed for that long.
[22927.52s -> 22932.32s]  It's hard to tell what he's going to do.
[22933.28s -> 22952.03s]  All right, this is a bust.
[22952.03s -> 22952.83s]  This is a shit run.
[22955.39s -> 22976.96s]  Are they cheating this game?
[22979.26s -> 22979.76s]  Probably.
[22980.30s -> 22981.34s]  I'm not going to use them though.
[22988.32s -> 22988.82s]  Really?
[22988.88s -> 22999.81s]  I don't like this LOL.
[22999.97s -> 23000.61s]  Yeah.
[23000.61s -> 23001.11s]  Yep.
[23001.73s -> 23002.53s]  Yep, yep, yep.
[23003.33s -> 23015.72s]  Man.
[23040.72s -> 23041.22s]  Move, do it.
[23042.40s -> 23044.13s]  Oh, that's not the move I wanted you to do.
[23048.26s -> 23048.90s]  Shit.
[23048.90s -> 23050.58s]  Oh, that's so bad to fuck up.
[23050.58s -> 23053.06s]  That was almost 80% of my whole health for the fuck me.
[23062.91s -> 23068.42s]  It's just when you get in close and you're fighting and it's just like cutting.
[23068.42s -> 23068.92s]  Oh, nope.
[23068.92s -> 23071.16s]  You pressed B because you were pressing B to attack the guy.
[23081.80s -> 23086.60s]  When you get in close again, it doesn't seem it's just like you're pressing B because you're hitting and you're attacking.
[23087.48s -> 23093.76s]  And this shit got buried in hell in 2000 fucking 15.
[23107.68s -> 23118.05s]  Like nobody wants this back.
[23118.05s -> 23120.21s]  Might as well just die again, Jeremy.
[23121.33s -> 23141.54s]  Did I just play it on normal?
[23141.54s -> 23145.30s]  I was like the second last boss in the game and I can't change it back now.
[23145.30s -> 23146.66s]  I'm gonna beat this motherfucker as well.
[23189.35s -> 23190.15s]  How many have left?
[23191.67s -> 23193.59s]  I don't even know how many deities have left.
[23196.63s -> 23198.23s]  We've time traveled like three times.
[23212.32s -> 23213.20s]  Fuck.
[23213.20s -> 23216.92s]  He stays on the ground.
[23216.92s -> 23217.88s]  I keep forgetting it.
[23225.17s -> 23232.12s]  It didn't.
[23232.90s -> 23245.01s]  My hand's sweating.
[23245.81s -> 23253.06s]  Did he hit me with something?
[23253.78s -> 23265.64s]  I wanted to fight the electricity man again.
[23266.44s -> 23268.20s]  For all the people I have to fight again.
[23269.16s -> 23270.20s]  They're just killing me.
[23271.64s -> 23279.70s]  Did I start making bite marks?
[23281.46s -> 23288.93s]  Can't go in.
[23288.93s -> 23289.09s]  All right.
[23289.09s -> 23289.41s]  Here we go.
[23289.41s -> 23289.81s]  This is the one.
[23290.37s -> 23311.91s]  It's only I'm gonna say it.
[23331.33s -> 23331.73s]  Hold on.
[23331.73s -> 23334.69s]  I love how Jeremy's too stupid to recover health.
[23334.69s -> 23335.65s]  What are you talking about?
[23336.37s -> 23338.21s]  What do you mean to recover health?
[23338.21s -> 23339.01s]  What do you wait?
[23339.01s -> 23339.51s]  What?
[23340.90s -> 23341.70s]  You're a liar.
[23341.70s -> 23342.34s]  You're a liar.
[23343.06s -> 23362.55s]  I would laugh so hard if I was able to recover health the whole game.
[23365.33s -> 23367.89s]  That would be an embarrassment.
[23367.89s -> 23384.20s]  I'm gonna stop doing that.
[23384.84s -> 23394.45s]  I'll go in.
[23394.45s -> 23399.46s]  You have to jump if you're getting hit.
[23399.78s -> 23400.58s]  I haven't gotten hit yet.
[23401.86s -> 23403.22s]  This whole time I've been playing.
[23403.22s -> 23404.42s]  My health has been dropping.
[23404.42s -> 23405.06s]  I have like a debuff.
[23405.06s -> 23405.86s]  I don't know what the fuck's wrong.
[23415.04s -> 23438.45s]  This is the one right here.
[23438.45s -> 23439.09s]  This is the one.
[23439.09s -> 23439.49s]  This is the one.
[23439.49s -> 23439.97s]  This is the one.
[23444.37s -> 23444.93s]  Patience.
[23444.93s -> 23445.81s]  Just have patience.
[23449.88s -> 23450.12s]  Come on.
[23450.12s -> 23458.68s]  Come at me.
[23458.68s -> 23465.04s]  This is the one right here.
[23465.68s -> 23466.00s]  All right.
[23466.00s -> 23466.96s]  Now we have to do.
[23466.96s -> 23469.20s]  Now we have to trade with Asura.
[23469.20s -> 23470.16s]  And do the same thing again.
[23471.92s -> 23473.88s]  I'm ready for it.
[23473.88s -> 23484.08s]  What the fuck are you doing, Jeremy?
[23484.08s -> 23484.64s]  What are you doing?
[23484.64s -> 23485.84s]  What are you doing, Jeremy?
[23486.64s -> 23487.28s]  I'm doing too fast.
[23487.28s -> 23487.76s]  It's a problem.
[23488.40s -> 23493.64s]  It's too fast.
[23493.64s -> 23494.04s]  I don't like this.
[23494.68s -> 23500.53s]  Get him.
[23500.53s -> 23508.29s]  Okay, we're good.
[23508.29s -> 23527.14s]  I'm gonna get the fucking stuff.
[23527.14s -> 23527.54s]  Fucking stuff.
[23527.54s -> 23527.86s]  Fucking stuff.
[23527.86s -> 23528.34s]  Exactly.
[23529.14s -> 23540.98s]  I thought he was just gonna go on, so.
[23540.98s -> 23541.54s]  I'm curious.
[23544.79s -> 23545.27s]  Do it.
[23545.27s -> 23545.91s]  Do it.
[23545.91s -> 23546.95s]  Just do it already.
[23547.67s -> 23588.76s]  Do we have to do phase three with this guy?
[23623.16s -> 23631.67s]  I'll be okay.
[23635.00s -> 23637.36s]  I'll just look up and.
[23637.36s -> 23638.80s]  Now all my teeth are gone.
[23638.80s -> 23639.44s]  I'll be all right.
[23639.44s -> 23700.87s]  I didn't even say it this time.
[23700.87s -> 23705.46s]  She cries because she knows of the world's suffering.
[23705.46s -> 23711.00s]  Once my world is liberated from the gold mine, I shall cease all the cries.
[23711.08s -> 23721.88s]  I'm crying right now.
[23721.88s -> 23722.76s]  They killed this dude.
[23755.54s -> 23756.02s]  Oh, no.
[23756.66s -> 23776.34s]  I knew I had to do it again.
[23781.44s -> 23782.79s]  Die.
[23782.79s -> 23783.11s]  Yeah.
[23787.40s -> 23789.48s]  I was out of that fucking range.
[23793.43s -> 23794.23s]  What the fuck?
[23797.52s -> 23798.32s]  What is that?
[23798.32s -> 23799.46s]  What is happening?
[23805.46s -> 23823.92s]  I tried to fucking dodge.
[23823.92s -> 23824.80s]  I'm fucked.
[23824.80s -> 23826.24s]  Now I'm gonna do this shit again.
[23830.80s -> 23833.88s]  He got me with a reverse counter.
[23833.88s -> 23859.25s]  Press B.
[23859.25s -> 23859.89s]  Yeah, I know.
[23859.89s -> 23860.45s]  So easy.
[23860.45s -> 23861.97s]  Just press the B button, like.
[23861.97s -> 23863.49s]  And then sometimes press A.
[23865.17s -> 23866.61s]  Why is it so hard for you?
[23867.65s -> 23879.33s]  All right.
[23879.33s -> 23879.97s]  That's what happens.
[23882.32s -> 23883.04s]  Holy fuck.
[23883.84s -> 23885.67s]  That's recovered.
[23900.66s -> 23901.06s]  Hold on.
[23901.06s -> 23902.34s]  I've done that move before, though.
[23902.90s -> 23903.30s]  Hold on.
[23903.30s -> 23904.10s]  I need to test this.
[23906.26s -> 23909.62s]  It's back to getting hit.
[23909.62s -> 23909.78s]  Yeah.
[23910.98s -> 23913.28s]  That was not working.
[23915.88s -> 23917.56s]  I see.
[23917.56s -> 23918.44s]  I didn't recover health.
[23919.32s -> 23922.24s]  It's recovering a little bit of health.
[23930.87s -> 23932.80s]  You take less damage.
[23932.80s -> 23933.28s]  Right.
[23933.28s -> 23934.32s]  It's worded weirdly.
[23935.36s -> 23939.40s]  It's you take less damage, not recover health.
[23939.40s -> 23940.68s]  You take less damage.
[23942.58s -> 23942.98s]  Are they?
[23942.98s -> 23944.42s]  Why do they word that so strangely?
[23946.32s -> 23946.96s]  I remember reading that.
[23946.96s -> 23948.24s]  It was like, oh, you take less damage.
[23949.22s -> 23951.38s]  But, like, after, like, I thought it was, like,
[23951.38s -> 23960.82s]  for, like, a few seconds after the recover damage, you salvage HP.
[23968.45s -> 23976.31s]  Why can't it just say you recover health?
[23976.79s -> 23995.83s]  Well, my back is wicked itchy right now.
[23998.84s -> 24000.23s]  I have, like, the itchiest back.
[24000.23s -> 24002.07s]  I have to, like, scratch my back with, like, a whip or something.
[24002.07s -> 24002.39s]  Hold on.
[24005.12s -> 24016.02s]  Imagine being so good you beat the game without healing.
[24016.02s -> 24017.14s]  See, that's a great way to look at it.
[24017.14s -> 24017.46s]  Thank you.
[24020.53s -> 24027.81s]  Is it always going to be B?
[24027.81s -> 24029.41s]  I'm scared to press it more than once.
[24029.41s -> 24030.13s]  That's why.
[24030.13s -> 24031.25s]  Is it going to be B every time?
[24055.56s -> 24057.43s]  Did you just counter it?
[24058.23s -> 24058.79s]  Why did you?
[24058.79s -> 24059.03s]  What?
[24059.91s -> 24061.75s]  Oh, really?
[24062.39s -> 24063.11s]  I got countered.
[24063.91s -> 24064.71s]  How'd he counter that?
[24081.09s -> 24087.16s]  In the circle.
[24121.62s -> 24128.85s]  I'm scared to try to go in the circle, I'll be honest.
[24151.17s -> 24151.41s]  All right.
[24151.41s -> 24152.69s]  Now punch it a million times.
[24152.69s -> 24153.33s]  It's always B.
[24153.33s -> 24153.97s]  It's always B.
[24155.01s -> 24162.88s]  Hold on.
[24162.88s -> 24163.44s]  Don't fuck it up.
[24164.32s -> 24169.91s]  I'm not going to get this fast.
[24169.91s -> 24186.71s]  Oh, god damn it.
[24186.71s -> 24210.95s]  All right.
[24210.95s -> 24211.35s]  Ammos.
[24217.19s -> 24218.07s]  Eat my ass.
[24237.40s -> 24237.88s]  Kill him.
[24238.44s -> 24241.06s]  You just beat this guy already.
[24241.06s -> 24242.18s]  I'm trying to do that.
[24243.06s -> 24243.94s]  Nobody even said that.
[24243.94s -> 24244.66s]  I'm just making that up.
[24246.79s -> 24247.59s]  Somebody probably did.
[24248.39s -> 24281.24s]  Not so fast.
[24281.88s -> 24282.84s]  I'm still alive.
[24283.56s -> 24284.76s]  Let's do this again.
[24284.76s -> 24286.68s]  You and me, two on two again.
[24288.20s -> 24296.71s]  Oh, that's it.
[24296.71s -> 24297.03s]  I got it.
[24297.67s -> 24309.20s]  Oh, wait.
[24309.20s -> 24312.88s]  He's not going to say, like, a funny line, like the goblin thing King does?
[24313.68s -> 24317.14s]  You're not going to, like, ruin a scene?
[24330.12s -> 24347.75s]  That's not how gravity works.
[24348.71s -> 24349.83s]  She's like a god.
[24349.83s -> 24350.95s]  She is weightless.
[24370.20s -> 24375.65s]  So you have power.
[24375.65s -> 24376.45s]  What do you think?
[24377.33s -> 24381.73s]  Charging at whatever is in front of you can save the world?
[24401.73s -> 24418.21s]  Yeah, that scared me a little bit, too.
[24418.21s -> 24422.85s]  That really was random loud noise in a YouTube video to fuck with you.
[24423.65s -> 24425.27s]  What do you mean?
[24426.31s -> 24452.31s]  You were the good guys.
[24453.19s -> 24458.96s]  This is, is this, he was the good guy?
[24458.96s -> 24466.20s]  You've lost your spirits.
[24467.32s -> 24471.49s]  Glitter is the will of the planet itself.
[24472.13s -> 24477.08s]  It will devour all the souls on Gaia.
[24477.08s -> 24479.73s]  Its power is limitless.
[24481.86s -> 24484.26s]  All the more reason we must defeat it.
[24488.90s -> 24489.70s]  Wait, Asura.
[24491.78s -> 24492.82s]  You didn't pay for it yet.
[24495.75s -> 24497.59s]  That cost $1,199.
[24498.39s -> 24500.74s]  I shouldn't.
[24504.32s -> 24505.28s]  Empty your pockets.
[24506.00s -> 24506.88s]  You never change.
[24511.27s -> 24514.93s]  Asura, how could I have been defeated?
[24518.34s -> 24519.22s]  Doesn't matter.
[24523.70s -> 24524.34s]  I see.
[24525.70s -> 24527.30s]  So not even you know.
[24527.94s -> 24531.06s]  And then there is no hope.
[24531.06s -> 24533.54s]  Just turn and just soccer kick this guy's head.
[24534.98s -> 24535.62s]  Mithra.
[24535.62s -> 24536.90s]  Just a full running start.
[24537.62s -> 24554.02s]  I do not deserve to be called your uncle.
[24554.02s -> 24555.14s]  That's your mom's brother.
[24555.86s -> 24556.58s]  It is all right.
[24556.58s -> 24557.70s]  The hell are you talking about?
[24559.81s -> 24560.61s]  Mithra.
[24560.61s -> 24563.78s]  There's father.
[24563.78s -> 24565.11s]  He is there.
[24565.83s -> 24568.40s]  He fought to save you.
[24573.01s -> 24575.09s]  There is still something left we must do.
[24579.27s -> 24580.63s]  We will end all of this.
[24580.63s -> 24581.27s]  Am I crying?
[24584.60s -> 24584.92s]  Come on.
[24584.92s -> 24585.80s]  You can hear that?
[24585.80s -> 24587.92s]  All Jerma is crying.
[24587.92s -> 24588.56s]  You can hear that?
[24589.60s -> 24593.19s]  I thought I could be emotional but I happen to be caught on camera.
[24593.19s -> 24602.58s]  So what are we supposed to do about this?
[24604.58s -> 24629.78s]  At what point do we just leave?
[24630.82s -> 24634.42s]  At what point do we just turn the fucking ship around and be like well
[24634.42s -> 24637.14s]  this 500 quadrillion other planets.
[24638.26s -> 24640.66s]  We just leave.
[24640.66s -> 24641.46s]  Go somewhere else.
[24651.33s -> 24654.13s]  You take a look at that and you kind of go yeah that's probably it.
[24654.13s -> 24655.33s]  That's probably it for Earth.
[24655.89s -> 24680.13s]  Defeat of Plague.
[24683.35s -> 24684.47s]  And the Imperial Hall.
[24685.11s -> 24688.39s]  My liege there's little time before Lytra's next revival.
[24688.39s -> 24690.63s]  We do not start preparing preemptive measures soon.
[24690.63s -> 24691.43s]  It will be too late.
[24692.71s -> 24695.11s]  Cruising to do nothing is also an option.
[24695.11s -> 24696.55s]  Change comes opposition.
[24696.55s -> 24698.31s]  Jinkoku would not respond well.
[24698.31s -> 24700.63s]  Well this is the kind of beginning that we fake killed.
[24701.35s -> 24704.23s]  Would you have our people take up arms and wait for Viltra's return
[24704.23s -> 24705.91s]  after we finally obtained a moment of peace?
[24707.19s -> 24709.51s]  With each awakening Viltra grows more powerful than the last.
[24709.51s -> 24711.59s]  Next time our forces may not be enough to subdue it.
[24712.47s -> 24714.95s]  The rate at which our civilization is growing far surpasses
[24714.95s -> 24715.99s]  that of the impure.
[24716.63s -> 24719.27s]  Furthermore the eight guardian generals have never been stronger
[24719.27s -> 24721.03s]  especially with such a powerful priestess.
[24721.91s -> 24725.75s]  Oh my liege enough I've given you my answer.
[24725.75s -> 24735.70s]  You are dismissed in Deus's office.
[24735.70s -> 24737.94s]  Commander Deus the emperor did not grant us permission.
[24739.06s -> 24741.94s]  Regrettably no the emperor is only interested in protecting himself.
[24741.94s -> 24745.70s]  He must be disposed of and you shall rise to the throne.
[24745.70s -> 24749.14s]  Brilliant do not misunderstand I have no intention of becoming emperor.
[24749.94s -> 24753.75s]  Mander was my destiny to purge this planet of the impure
[24753.75s -> 24756.55s]  and if I must be the one to guide our people in doing so then so be it.
[24757.35s -> 24760.77s]  I'll always be a warrior once we have accomplished our goal I shall reign.
[24762.21s -> 24768.93s]  Resign my post not not reign supreme not like reign all over everybody resign
[24772.34s -> 24774.66s]  but you'll just be sacrificing yourself for the cause.
[24775.54s -> 24779.46s]  My purpose has always been for the cause I have no desire to sit on a throne for all eternity.
[24781.40s -> 24782.68s]  The source of all gold.
[24783.56s -> 24799.04s]  Episode 18 this is it right.
[24812.93s -> 24814.29s]  I'm not doing the DLC tonight.
[24827.28s -> 24828.96s]  DLC is like five minutes.
[24831.80s -> 24836.79s]  Throw this game in the trash.
[24838.95s -> 24847.94s]  Holy shit it's two hours or so yeah I'm not doing a 10 hour stream.
[24849.22s -> 24860.53s]  What oh I thought we for a second I thought this was the DLC.
[24862.61s -> 24873.73s]  Let's go kill the snake inside the planet.
[24874.37s -> 24881.86s]  Can I still buy the DLC?
[24898.93s -> 24901.41s]  Microsoft points yeah it's a pain in the ass.
[24912.13s -> 24913.01s]  Oh I wasn't even looking.
[24919.64s -> 24923.78s]  I was just looking I was just talking to you guys I wasn't even watching.
[24974.16s -> 24975.92s]  They kind of have to deal with this shit every day.
[24975.92s -> 25071.54s]  Snake that's right this is snake snake number one there's one this is cool this is cool
[25093.12s -> 25097.76s]  yeah this is super interesting yeah I'm kind of just like
[25100.16s -> 25120.26s]  eat a sandwich and go to bed and take a bath are we gonna fuse please fuse do a fusion
[25122.02s -> 25186.26s]  why are there two bees you're playing too the body we're gonna go in here and there's gonna be
[25187.30s -> 25192.90s]  decrepit little monster in there that's like slimy and slugged we're just gonna have to
[25192.90s -> 25215.40s]  stab it once the whole thing dies well someone was asking what would people be doing right now
[25216.20s -> 25229.12s]  there you go I would take out my cell phone and videotape and then fucking throw as hard
[25229.12s -> 25231.36s]  as I could in the space of the cell phone somebody would find it one day
[25232.48s -> 25235.76s]  just turn around and just whip it as hard as I can into space
[25236.80s -> 25247.19s]  I'm eventually come across and be like holy shit this is crazy its power is overwhelming are you
[25253.20s -> 25270.71s]  you never change that is why I cannot give up either fight you there's a face oh here comes

[25322.04s -> 25325.88s]  bugs all over my room and shit spiders everywhere that's weird but it can do that
[25327.80s -> 25333.73s]  I don't know the tech existed to do this
[25333.73s -> 25350.15s]  what that's a lot that's a lot of arms
[25409.70s -> 25415.14s]  I fucking ruined that one that was the end of the game the only thing I could think of is

[26932.61s -> 26975.99s]  waiting please my credit's number four Mithra who made this game well I'm surprised somebody's
[26975.99s -> 26981.43s]  saying that considering that let's say let's say the average viewer is here for let's say
[26982.71s -> 26986.71s]  30 minutes 20 30 minutes average time somebody spends on a stream maybe
[26989.32s -> 26996.12s]  Capcom's logo has popped up probably every 25 to 30 minutes so I'm actually surprised
[26996.12s -> 27023.38s]  that anyone would even ask that so this is the third running credit real wink all right fine
[27024.34s -> 27036.37s]  all right see you guys tomorrow I'm not doing DLC right now I'm the same being I'm not making
[27036.37s -> 27043.12s]  this a total fuckface stream no I'm going five days in a row here I'm not going to be let's do
[27043.12s -> 27049.24s]  11 and a half hours and let me fucking burn my eyes out no I'm not doing the DLC tomorrow
[27049.24s -> 27083.32s]  we're gonna do something else there you are in the freezer do the DLC we'll see what we got going
[27083.32s -> 27085.96s]  on this week I might throw it in here somewhere because there's a couple there's a bunch of other

[27131.01s -> 27142.71s]  also something I want to do I still have not the chibi robo I really really badly want to play it
[27143.51s -> 27158.56s]  I'm just gonna get it I'm just gonna get it but that was a Asura's Wrath it was pretty fun it was
[27158.56s -> 27175.17s]  over the top I enjoyed it it's not over well I mean it is but not it might not be I skipped this
[27176.20s -> 27183.57s]  I can't even skip it what are your impressions my impressions are uh all right the boss fights
[27183.57s -> 27190.16s]  were really cool just wish I didn't have to press Y as many times as I did like you even you take
[27190.16s -> 27194.40s]  away even half the times that I had to press the button Y and I would have probably thought this
[27194.40s -> 27214.02s]  is a very game the DLC is no I know about the DLC don't worry see if we can fit it in somewhere
[27214.02s -> 27215.86s]  because what is it like an hour or two couple hours
[27223.30s -> 27226.66s]  yeah all right well yeah we'll do it probably this week we'll throw it in somewhere
[27227.38s -> 27235.64s]  that's fine all right is it like after credit scene or something
[27236.44s -> 27244.18s]  with the Diablo yeah we could do Diablo 2 hardcore and then whatever happens with that
[27244.18s -> 27257.06s]  throw this at the end do the DLC now no I'm not doing a 10-hour stream
[27273.01s -> 27281.83s]  please yeah all right now I'm in I still play Return of the King and I'm kind of concerned
[27281.83s -> 27303.62s]  to play it just because you know how the last one went I can I skip this oh breaking point
[27303.62s -> 27327.88s]  total rank B B A C we're good to see them all C for crap oh there is another thing after this

[27359.51s -> 27372.74s]  giants spider boss that's why everybody wants me to do it the hidden episode can be unlocked
[27372.74s -> 27377.38s]  by achieving an S rank in five or more episodes or complete 50 or more episodes on any difficulty
[27378.58s -> 27405.01s]  I thought you guys said this is DLC true episode a turn of events look at all these C's

[27527.72s -> 27542.04s]  all right let's do the end I didn't want to go too much longer than this I want to be up and ready
[27542.04s -> 27548.50s]  to go tomorrow easy and the next day in the next day the next day in the next day bullshit you got
[27548.50s -> 27563.28s]  a gold wrap great actually all right let's go crack head gaming yeah kind of but uh circ
[27563.28s -> 27567.28s]  whack thanks for the 500 bits I'm so happy you're playing this it's amazing it's literally a pog
[27567.28s -> 27577.78s]  simulator first hour is slow but it gets fantastic it did start off a little slow but we did give it
[27577.78s -> 27585.03s]  a chance and then I beat the base game I thought it was good I just wish it was a little less
[27585.03s -> 27595.59s]  QTE just just enough for me to not you know think my nose at it was that phrase something like that
[27595.59s -> 27602.31s]  it was crazy though the fat boss yeah the the big fat boss that puts his finger down
[27605.01s -> 27612.05s]  the game was made during the end of the QTE yeah the era of QTE unfortunately still a fun game
[27612.05s -> 27622.85s]  though I did enjoy it otherwise I would not have played it I wouldn't have streamed the game for
[27622.85s -> 27627.88s]  almost eight hours if I didn't think it was fun it was definitely worth playing but thank you
[27627.88s -> 27633.44s]  appreciate the 500 bits thank you son of genova for the 250 hydra please check the uh the carnivore
[27633.44s -> 27639.28s]  saga someday especially carnivores too or ice age they are great they're old as fuck though
[27639.84s -> 27652.23s]  I do remember those games those games were those games are crazy he plays the dinos don't even
[27652.23s -> 27660.80s]  run around as a dinosaur in that game I need to see if I can get a hold of some of those
[27662.21s -> 27665.25s]  though you hunt no yeah you hunt you hunt them they're attacking you and shit
[27665.89s -> 27671.04s]  let's check them out add them on the list we're gonna do Tony Hawk's underground today but I
[27671.04s -> 27677.56s]  didn't have an xbox hard drive or something it was embarrassing but it's all good we'll get that this
[27677.56s -> 27681.16s]  week I'm gonna play Tony Hawk's underground this week I really do so I'm gonna probably tomorrow
[27681.16s -> 27685.99s]  morning I'm gonna get up and we might even just do it tomorrow try to get up early and go get one
[27686.71s -> 27693.96s]  I wanted to do that today so we're gonna have to do that tomorrow
[27697.99s -> 27703.91s]  Vilemi gave 5 000 bits I missed this one they say German we tricked you into watching an anime on
[27703.91s -> 27711.24s]  stream the best part about this is talking to VR Josh about how much he recommended it he's like
[27711.24s -> 27715.48s]  don't play you gotta play Serious Wrath on stream it's awesome it's really good I'm like hey so what
[27715.48s -> 27724.84s]  why and he's like oh I didn't play it I watched like a few of the cutscenes I'm just I did not
[27724.84s -> 27727.80s]  say what did you say you said something like that you said something like what did you say
[27728.52s -> 27733.01s]  you said something like that read my recommendation what does it what does it say
[27733.65s -> 27746.42s]  he said it was like his favorite game ever made let's get recommendations let's go search VR Josh
[27756.28s -> 27761.48s]  he's deleting I've been recommending this a while but Serious Wrath for xbox c2 would be
[27761.48s -> 27765.24s]  worth experiencing on stream at least once a very flawed game but worth experiencing just for the
[27765.24s -> 27771.48s]  absurd cutscenes and boss battles the boss battles consist of mostly QTEs but the sheer
[27771.48s -> 27780.96s]  scale and anime nature of them make it worthwhile oh shit you did say that you didn't like it no you
[27780.96s -> 27790.08s]  said you liked it see yeah but but when I said hey what's what's makes the game so good you
[27790.08s -> 27794.88s]  didn't you say I don't know I didn't play it that long you said what did you say in the beginning
[27794.88s -> 27806.36s]  of the stream you said something in the beginning of the stream that's what I'm referring to he's
[27806.36s -> 27812.77s]  like oh I don't I didn't I didn't play it show us the corpse face again no all right you know
[27812.77s -> 27820.92s]  what I'm just gonna purge you get out of here stop uh but anyways thank you for letting me for the
[27820.92s -> 27832.50s]  50 thanks to the I hope we can giggly today too fuck I was wicked giggly today I was just like

[27842.72s -> 27849.78s]  dollars as well we did do the whole game and I'm glad it did fairy with a pan thanks for 500 bits
[27849.78s -> 27857.00s]  germy you should play the lost episode the dlc on hard we're gonna try to throw it in at some
[27857.00s -> 27862.45s]  point this week I don't know it depends on I'm doing I'm gonna try to do Tony Hawk Underground
[27862.45s -> 27869.16s]  tomorrow so it's sitting on the same console so maybe I mean if I get really into Tony Hawk
[27869.16s -> 27872.76s]  Underground tomorrow and I play it for like six seven eight hours then of course I'm not gonna do
[27872.76s -> 27876.92s]  the dlc but if for some reason I only play Tony Hawk for a few hours or something then I'll just
[27876.92s -> 27886.24s]  stick it on top of that whatever we'll see I will do it gnarly thanks to the 250 here's a short
[27886.24s -> 27893.04s]  germa dream I dreamed I was in chat during a stream and I typed germa venus twice a mod saw it and
[27893.04s -> 27906.00s]  instantly perma banned me I'm sorry that happened to you uh sweaty man thanks for the five community
[27906.00s -> 27915.94s]  sub sweaty men Pugles thanks for the 400 bits auto is a speck of dust or auto no I can't
[27916.50s -> 27945.97s]  what is nothing but a can't is nothing but a speck of dust in the past that's pretty
[27949.76s -> 27961.24s]  anyways let's keep going uh thank you Pugles for the 400 bits doc thanks for the 250 doc
[27961.24s -> 27965.00s]  3660 hey germ I'm thinking of buying you a birthday present but I'm not sure what color I
[27965.00s -> 27985.19s]  should get just walkers uh walkers.com well why is one of the most expensive ones the shittiest
[27985.19s -> 27991.24s]  reviewed one the one that's 60 dollars is apparently like the best one with 22 reviews
[27992.36s -> 27999.56s]  this one's 135 dollars and it's it's got three and a half stars uh the green one thank you
[27999.56s -> 28009.89s]  appreciate it thank you doc we had a huge community subs come in from snar bosses

[28018.37s -> 28024.92s]  thanks for dumping a shitload of subs speaking of those subs why don't we show them
[28025.64s -> 28038.32s]  let's switch over to here thanks all of you hopefully we see you again tomorrow
[28039.04s -> 28050.39s]  hopefully the tony hawks underground well I played the credits actually jumped what the
[28050.87s -> 28068.60s]  scare but I don't believe any noise underground 2 is more fun uh we're gonna have that's actually
[28068.60s -> 28080.04s]  a really really good question I have both of them I have both I was kind of unsure of what I wanted
[28080.04s -> 28094.21s]  to do I could just do both thug 2 is a baby game thug 1 is best thug 2 is better thug 1 is classic
[28094.45s -> 28102.18s]  yeah I don't I mean this I knew this was gonna happen so I got both so we can just do both
[28102.18s -> 28107.30s]  eventually we're probably gonna start with the first one it seems like right idea but here comes
[28107.30s -> 28117.84s]  up thanks a lot guys for your extreme support of this channel thank you the short games anyways
[28117.84s -> 28126.05s]  yeah oh right soundtrack am I gonna have that host the stream tomorrow is gonna be muted
[28126.21s -> 28129.65s]  the stream tomorrow is gonna be muted so if you're planning on watching the vod
[28131.73s -> 28135.96s]  sorry but I don't know I mean I could turn the soundtrack off and put on like
[28135.96s -> 28143.19s]  yoshi's island or something but I don't know I'll figure that out anti-poison thanks for the 1500 bits
[28144.39s -> 28147.91s]  hey germo I was thinking about getting a germa rat tattoo and was wondering if you would be
[28147.91s -> 28152.39s]  okay with that that's not about me being okay with that it's about you being okay with that
[28153.03s -> 28158.55s]  uh in 10 years are you gonna think that that's all right still if you want a germa rat tattoo
[28158.55s -> 28169.27s]  that's a you thing that you have to decide I can't decide that for you I would give that a good
[28169.27s -> 28177.67s]  think um just don't put it on your face you know put it like I don't know somewhere you're gonna
[28177.67s -> 28187.92s]  hide it because in 30 years you might be like I don't know germa rat tattoo germa he disapproved
[28187.92s -> 28192.64s]  it never get don't know I didn't say don't get a tat don't I said don't put a rat tattoo a germa
[28192.64s -> 28201.54s]  rat tattoo on your face in 10 years the term is going to get cancelled for saying something
[28201.54s -> 28221.06s]  fucked up okay why are you planning on for this I don't like that you're planning for that
[28224.74s -> 28235.22s]  oh long story short if you're gonna get a tattoo make sure something that you really want um if
[28235.22s -> 28238.90s]  you come back to me in like three years and say hey this tattoo sucks why did you tell me to do
[28238.90s -> 28243.06s]  that I'm gonna say I didn't I'm gonna say I told you don't if you feed I have nothing to do with
[28243.06s -> 28253.32s]  this five years are gonna be 40 yeah don't remind me that hurts that comment I don't want to see
[28253.32s -> 28267.54s]  that I just vomited everywhere bye germa I'll go to the doctor hope you have a safe next day
[28267.54s -> 28272.98s]  you don't sick anymore whatever it's me drink some fluids have some soup goku thank you goku
[28272.98s -> 28279.62s]  green for the 550 here my I would I had your stream up tonight while I was doing my uh my
[28279.62s -> 28284.18s]  testosterone injection when I pulled the needle out there was a lot of blood it was not anything
[28284.18s -> 28288.90s]  to worry about because it can happen but I yelled at the same time as sura did wait a lot of blood
[28289.94s -> 28313.30s]  why did I read that I don't know like I don't know everyone's gonna be streaming at 90 I don't
[28313.30s -> 28321.12s]  think I've ever had any injection I've ever had I don't think there's any blood blood from a needle
[28321.76s -> 28336.07s]  does it happen oh be careful why would you tell people this what me I I bet that I've never had
[28336.07s -> 28349.57s]  blood I bet having six arms would help I once got a flu shot and I'm not going to read the
[28349.57s -> 28355.33s]  rest of that because it's fucking horrifying so I'm not don't get a tattoo on your face of my face
[28355.33s -> 28362.82s]  okay don't do that it'll look really strange I'm sorry to hear that uh goku hopefully you're all
[28362.82s -> 28369.20s]  right plug boy thanks to the 500 bits what's up germa was wondering if back in the day you
[28369.20s -> 28374.00s]  were ever into any hardcore shooters like arma and such I've always been into been like escape
[28374.00s -> 28379.04s]  from tarkov has been stealing my heart recently not a recommendation though because considering
[28379.04s -> 28383.36s]  how you reacted while playing pub g you would hate it just not really into the br thing
[28384.56s -> 28391.68s]  no I never really got into armor no armor wasn't necessarily br but escape from tarkov kind of is
[28395.32s -> 28400.61s]  not really into the br thing though escape from tarkov isn't the battle royale
[28401.33s -> 28418.29s]  not what is it it isn't br what is it is it oh you just it's just an fps it's just a realistic
[28418.29s -> 28424.37s]  fps don't they like drop everybody in a spot and people have to like extract and shit it's
[28424.37s -> 28438.23s]  a rogue like fps multiplayer stalker without the anomalies arena huh that's all right that's cool
[28438.23s -> 28447.22s]  I thought it was br I stand corrected all right hey mark melzer uh thanks for the 250 hey germa
[28447.22s -> 28451.70s]  I've always loved your stream especially the rhythm ones as of late speaking of which would
[28451.70s -> 28458.02s]  you consider playing the path upon remaster on ps4 yes it's on the list glad to see a streamer
[28458.02s -> 28461.94s]  willing to play older pc games rather than what's hot at the moment this hidden cult classics out
[28461.94s -> 28468.85s]  there let me do the reason why I play so many old games is because I'm just not really into any of
[28468.85s -> 28474.21s]  the new ones you mentioned br br's are really really hot right now and some of the multiplayer
[28474.21s -> 28486.36s]  shooters are really really hot right now I'm just not really into them anymore I just not the last
[28486.44s -> 28492.92s]  two big gaming trends have been genres I don't really don't really care about the big moba
[28492.92s -> 28497.72s]  explosion five years ago or so I don't didn't really care besides I played smite but a little
[28497.72s -> 28504.82s]  bit not really so I didn't really jump on that too much and then this newest kind of
[28505.70s -> 28512.98s]  fps third person br it's been a big big explosion the last few years I haven't really been into that
[28512.98s -> 28523.68s]  either I made 15 videos on smite yeah but that was also back in like 2013 that's not very much
[28523.68s -> 28533.83s]  considering how big that genre was at the time the people still place my smile still a big thing
[28534.39s -> 28545.19s]  I still think it's good I haven't played in a long time 25 Dr Pepper thanks for the 250
[28545.19s -> 28554.55s]  Super Bowl prediction I'm from Kansas City so I'm a little biased um I just it's just gonna be a
[28554.55s -> 28570.47s]  fun game it's gonna be a fun game right chiefs I'm okay I'm gonna have to say I'm gonna have to say
[28570.47s -> 28578.04s]  the chiefs for one reason because of that old Snickers commercial where the guy paints the
[28578.04s -> 28585.72s]  end zone wrong he's the whole commercial is a guy painting the end zone for the chiefs he's doing
[28585.72s -> 28591.80s]  he's going up and down he's sweating he's wiping his brow and he's doing a really really good job
[28591.80s -> 28596.36s]  they don't show what he's writing and then one of the players comes up and he's like hey man
[28596.36s -> 28603.04s]  that's a really good job but who are the chefs it pans up and it's just the chefs he didn't put the
[28603.04s -> 28622.10s]  eye he's like oh Jesus so I'm gonna say the Kansas City Chief what a great commercial yeah there you
[28622.10s -> 28634.44s]  go this is my Super Bowl prediction all right chiefs Kansas City Chiefs 19 to 6 Kansas City
[28634.44s -> 28652.58s]  Chiefs 19 to 6 gonna be a fucked up game hey jerma put sun chips in f-tier yes it did thanks
[28652.58s -> 28656.66s]  to the 250 jerma I'm here to tell you that you're still dreaming after you got naked on stream one
[28656.66s -> 28660.82s]  guy saw your penis you passed out from embarrassment every stream from that moment has been in your head
[28661.38s -> 28664.82s]  only way you can wake up is to peek your mic also you should do it because it's my birthday
[28665.70s -> 28674.64s]  what a wonderful comment this is you this ticks this you checked every box happy birthday by the
[28674.64s -> 28687.94s]  way all right I'll see happy birthday seriously jerma put sun chips in f-tier have a good one hope
[28687.94s -> 28698.77s]  you had a lot of sun chips right we can't leave yet let's go one more just got one more vlog boy
[28698.77s -> 28702.37s]  thanks in 250 dropping some more bits for you tonight before I sign off I think a game you
[28702.37s -> 28708.21s]  would really severely enjoy possibly off-stream is disco-alsium I was gonna stream disco-alsium
[28709.41s -> 28712.37s]  but I decided not to some people told me it was way too long
[28712.37s -> 28723.00s]  and that I would get bored you got to remember if I cannot complete a game within two to four streams
[28724.04s -> 28737.86s]  it gradually drops I mean it gradually drops like a rock after that if I'm gonna play it again also
[28737.86s -> 28742.98s]  I'll be the big 21 next week and be upset there won't be a stream yes I will not be around next
[28742.98s -> 28751.56s]  week I got a lot of friends coming in but I don't have any plans on streaming it anymore
[28752.12s -> 28761.03s]  does look fun though but I'm not gonna catch you next week happy birthday plug boy preemptively
[28762.39s -> 28770.18s]  why am I uncommitted to playing games I mean I'm not uncommitted it's just okay here hear me out
[28772.50s -> 28779.30s]  if if a game is more than 40 hours to get through the main game off-stream I wouldn't really play it
[28779.94s -> 28783.70s]  also I wouldn't play it off-stream really Red Dead Redemption 2 is the only exception
[28783.78s -> 28788.58s]  in probably the last couple of years at least so if you're talking about like this stream is
[28788.58s -> 28792.26s]  eight hours a typical stream is somewhere around six and a half to like seven and a half hours
[28792.26s -> 28798.02s]  it's like a typical average stream on this channel so if I can't beat a game in like
[28798.02s -> 28801.78s]  40 to 50 hours I really don't want to walk in and play a game for like 100 hours
[28806.44s -> 28813.72s]  Dark Souls Dark Souls well I look there is an exception for some of that's like my one of my
[28813.72s -> 28821.08s]  favorite gaming franchises I love Dark Souls and I love all the Dark Souls games and all the
[28821.08s -> 28826.92s]  from software games so that's not really a fair comparison because you're talking about one of my
[28826.92s -> 28838.80s]  favorite game studio franchises ever Darkwood I beat Darkwood in three streams Darkwood was
[28838.80s -> 28855.99s]  three streams my game was crazy but yeah if if I can't do it in like under five full streams
[28855.99s -> 28858.39s]  it's something I'm probably not going to stream I'll just do it on my own time
[28860.00s -> 28865.76s]  unless it's something I'm so insanely into like for instance Elden Ring is going to come out
[28865.76s -> 28870.08s]  I'm going to stream every second of me playing that game just because I I can't wait and I'm
[28870.08s -> 28873.84s]  going to play it as long as it takes you guys know that's happening but that's something that I
[28873.84s -> 28890.61s]  kind of do should be fun but hopefully that gives you your answer thank you near shoe for
[28890.61s -> 28894.13s]  the 300 bits a German doing college assignments to stream is the best longtime fan from Canada
[28894.13s -> 28899.72s]  keep bringing in you I wish you luck on your assignments hopefully you get a decent grade
[28900.85s -> 28905.57s]  a plus it's just don't even don't worry about that nobody you don't nobody cares about that
[28906.29s -> 28909.73s]  when you get out of college nobody knows if you got an a plus on your fucking paper
[28909.73s -> 28913.97s]  you know don't worry about that just do your best to do good enough you know like they're
[28913.97s -> 28917.89s]  not going to see you oh wait you got a b plus on that fucking paper they're not going to know
[28917.89s -> 28930.60s]  you got a degree in your hand we know it's fine god knows that's all right
[28933.65s -> 28941.94s]  how do you work listening to this psychopath yeah pretty good point actually
[28946.88s -> 28950.48s]  all right I'll see you guys tomorrow or hopefully Tony Hawk's underground if not then we're going to
[28950.48s -> 28960.79s]  do okay if I cannot get an xbox hard drive then we are going to do out of wilds okay all right
