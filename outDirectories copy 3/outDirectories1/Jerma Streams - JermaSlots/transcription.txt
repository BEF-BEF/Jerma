[0.57s -> 12.73s]  But anyways, we're going to move on from there. Oh, it's blue, sorry. I apologize for the blue.
[12.73s -> 22.62s]  We're going to transition here to the slot game coming up as Jerma Slots. This is the community
[22.62s -> 39.10s]  game. They changed the title. This was made by CAD, and I'll tell you, actually rage quit.
[40.65s -> 53.00s]  We got other things to do today. And by the way, this game is going to just be downloadable
[53.00s -> 59.82s]  on Steam for free. Just a free game. I did not have anything to officially do with this.
[59.90s -> 65.93s]  This is just something somebody made. And it was really, really interesting, really cool.
[65.93s -> 72.23s]  And I wanted to try it. This looks pretty elaborate. I've been told it takes about
[72.23s -> 76.98s]  an hour or two to complete the whole thing, depending on how lucky you are. And we're
[76.98s -> 94.81s]  going to find out. So I don't know what to expect, but I'm sure it'll be interesting.
[94.81s -> 122.07s]  This is Jerma Slots. Just open it. Okay, here we go. There it is. Please read.
[122.07s -> 135.10s]  The slot machine in this game has several winning three of a kind combinations. Each
[135.10s -> 141.30s]  combination is a special event tied to it. If you want to see an event without naturally
[141.30s -> 145.14s]  spinning a winning combination, hit escape, go to the pause menu and check the enable
[145.14s -> 150.70s]  cheats box. A cheat drop down will become active under that box. Select the winning
[150.70s -> 156.54s]  combination from that menu and the next spin will give you that combination. Okay,
[156.54s -> 163.06s]  most events will occur only once restarting the game resets all events. Click on my face
[163.06s -> 185.75s]  to begin. What do you got against David Bowie? Well, here's my, here's my old intro
[185.75s -> 201.75s]  from like 2011. That was quite the intro. Here it is. This is the menu. Here's the
[201.75s -> 207.82s]  options. Let's take a look. Resolution full screen, graphics full. Intro is on. Okay.
[208.79s -> 215.16s]  There it is. I have no idea what to expect. I'm looking forward to this.
[215.72s -> 225.43s]  This is not out yet. This will be able to be downloaded after this stream is over,
[225.43s -> 231.50s]  potentially even Monday because steam, I'm not sure you can, there's a release schedule
[231.50s -> 237.53s]  thing. It might be on Monday. So I got a free, I got a press copy of this game.
[237.53s -> 241.43s]  Just want to make sure everyone knows this has been, this key was provided to me.
[241.43s -> 263.69s]  I'm ready. Let's see how this works. So I can look around. This is, is it W A S D? Oh,
[263.77s -> 277.45s]  you dick. Press E to go. Oh, you just really, you're killing me here. Can I do anything else?
[277.45s -> 286.46s]  Can I interact with something? Can I jump? That's a cool, I'm going to, okay. Let's
[286.46s -> 301.48s]  give myself a boost. Oh, let me look at the stickers. What are these ones? It's Jax,
[303.40s -> 309.21s]  Slug, Asteroid. Oh, this is emotes. That's awesome. All right. How much money do I get?
[314.90s -> 324.73s]  This is so cool. Press these keys to bet and spin. Press E to buy more bald coins. Okay.
[324.73s -> 338.44s]  So how many bald coins do I have? What did I just put in? I put in a $25 bill? All right,
[338.44s -> 347.77s]  here we go. So I'm going to do, let's spin. How many, we've got max bet this thing, right?
[348.41s -> 364.33s]  There's nothing. So there's rat, glue man, my face, two rats. How much, how much down am I?
[365.78s -> 387.91s]  16 bald coins. I can't hit anything. Oh, you can, you can hold, wait, hold. Wait,
[387.91s -> 397.80s]  wait. I need the instructions. F1, F2, F3. E is interact. Okay. So F1, F2, F3.
[398.52s -> 404.46s]  If the player has enough money, they may hold up to two of the three wheels in order to
[404.46s -> 408.06s]  increase their odds for winning combination. A player can unhold held wheels by pressing
[408.06s -> 413.83s]  the same button again. The cost per wheel increases depending on the bet amount. Okay.
[413.83s -> 426.10s]  Cost 10 bitcoins per wheel. That's like $50,000. That's not, that's not good enough for me.
[427.86s -> 438.26s]  I'm out of money. Free rats!
[438.26s -> 445.88s]  We're the rats. We're the rats. We pray at night. We stalk at night. We're the rats.
[446.98s -> 449.62s]  I'm the giant rat. Holy shit.
[451.62s -> 455.46s]  Let's see what kind of trouble we can get our sense into.
[456.18s -> 462.92s]  What is that worth? Five bucks? That was awesome. That was only five dollars.
[463.56s -> 471.21s]  I need to put, how do I, I need to put money in. No, I want, I'm gonna do it again. Spin.
[475.00s -> 492.30s]  Okay, hold the rats. Press E to, life is pain. I hate, there's bits on there by the way.
[493.10s -> 509.08s]  So that's, all right, that's 50 bucks. Max bet. Glue man, glue man. All right,
[509.08s -> 514.82s]  hold the glue man's, right? Hold the glue man's. Wait, I can't, I can only hold one of the glue
[514.82s -> 523.18s]  man's because my bet's too high. It's 10. God damn, I need more money. I can't hold, I need to,
[523.18s -> 533.64s]  I got a max bet. I'm sorry, I have to. I can't, no, I can't, lower the bet. What if I just,
[533.64s -> 545.10s]  what if I do one instead? Okay, I can hold it with one. Glue man. Yes! Glue man wants to
[545.10s -> 559.30s]  fight. Fight, item, germa, run, item. Let's go with, let's go with fight. Elbow drop, Jex mode,
[559.86s -> 569.62s]  attack, wrestling, buff, legend, presto, majesto is a debuff, bake, save, attack, that's shriek.
[572.70s -> 581.96s]  Super effective. Glue man uses choke slam. This is awesome. Do you have any items?
[582.04s -> 588.79s]  Pure cholesterol, old pizza, fully heals me, heals germa for a moderate amount,
[589.43s -> 596.01s]  fully restores all of germa's abilities, cooking wine, ice coffee, fully restores one of germa's
[596.01s -> 601.85s]  abilities. I don't think, I don't need these yet. What does this mean? You have no germas left.
[602.65s -> 615.53s]  Okay, what about presto majesto? I missed it. God damn it. I'm gonna have to start eating
[615.53s -> 625.75s]  pizza. All right, what is Jex mode? Okay, let's try Jex. Germa uses Jex mode. Glue man uses hail
[625.75s -> 632.07s]  mary and he missed. So I got plus two here. All right, and now I want to do elbow drop. No,
[632.07s -> 644.58s]  no, back, back tap. All right, good. Germa can't move. Glue man uses showboat. All right,
[644.58s -> 651.35s]  we both hit plus two. Shit, he's gonna kill me. He crit! That's a critical hit?
[652.31s -> 663.69s]  Ah, all right, I need to eat something. I still can't move? I gotta heal. Old pizza.
[664.49s -> 667.29s]  Germa digs an old pizza out of his bag and eats it.
[673.26s -> 678.81s]  All right, showboat is worn off. I think I'm all right still. Let's fight. What does
[679.77s -> 691.88s]  elbow drop presto majesto? Confused. Glue man is mesmerized. Good. Now we're gonna back
[691.88s -> 708.82s]  stab. Okay, mesmerized still, right? Yep. Glue man shakes off the magic and uses showboat.
[708.82s -> 728.58s]  I'm gonna talk about, damn it, bonding agent. I need to heal. Elbow drop. I fucking missed.
[730.58s -> 736.70s]  Drinks wrestle sweat. Chokeslam has been restored. Uh oh, I need to eat pizza again.
[737.26s -> 751.88s]  Shit, this is kind of safe. It's level 99. All right, he's a higher level than me. That's not
[751.88s -> 768.94s]  fair. You have no germans. Oh, what about, what about ice coffee abilities? Pure cholesterol? No.
[769.58s -> 775.77s]  He's confused. Let's go again. Let's do, try elbow drop. I want to land this. It's not very
[775.77s -> 783.96s]  effective. So we gotta do, but he's still confused. We're gonna have to go with backs.
[783.96s -> 792.34s]  We're gonna have to backstab again. Nice. All right, keeping confused. Still mesmerized.
[792.34s -> 805.91s]  Perfect. Can I do it again? Do it again. Keep it in a constant state. Again. Shit.
[808.89s -> 813.83s]  I need to use an item. Uh, cooking wine. Fully restores one of my abilities.
[815.51s -> 824.82s]  All abilities are restored. He just healed. Shit. Uh, presto majesto again.
[825.62s -> 840.06s]  No, god damn it. He's gonna kill me. Presto majesto, Jex mode, then backstab.
[840.70s -> 860.74s]  What happens if I die? Hit it. Critical hit. Look at that health drop. Do it again. He's still
[860.74s -> 871.82s]  confused. I can do it again. Crit again. Oh, he looks pretty close. Still mesmerized. Again.
[872.54s -> 903.67s]  Hit it. Yes. Here we go. Crit. Uh, he's still confused. I need to heal. Uh, eat another,
[903.75s -> 913.29s]  eat another pizza. We're good. I might be able to end it right here. See, how many do I have?
[913.29s -> 933.51s]  I got two more presto. Uh oh. No! No! Shit. Oh no. I, at this point, if it's, uh, I,
[934.07s -> 966.97s]  it's a race now. Oh my god, he keeps healing. This is never gonna end. No, not a full heal
[966.97s -> 982.84s]  yet. Not until I desperately need it. Stop eating pizza? No, back it up here. All right,
[982.84s -> 1000.57s]  here we go. Give me a crit. Bring it down. Stay, yes, still confused. What do we got for items? Uh,
[1000.57s -> 1029.02s]  I have to do bag of diced coffee again. Good. Give more off. Try it again. Yep. I'm gonna beat
[1029.02s -> 1053.34s]  it. One more of those. Stay confused. Yes! Again. Yes! He's so close. Yes! No! Don't heal.
[1053.90s -> 1076.44s]  Oh god damn it. What? Uh, oh my god. No. That sucks.
[1083.82s -> 1095.48s]  What happens if I lose? Do I die? I got greedy. What was I supposed to do? I had to try.
[1096.20s -> 1112.90s]  Don't worry, I'm gonna crit twice. There's one. Again. I'm fine. Everything's fine. He's still
[1112.90s -> 1119.32s]  confused. Okay, we're off. We have to try this again and then I have to use. How much more
[1119.32s -> 1132.50s]  cooking wine do I have? Good. I only have one more cooking wine. Wait, I'm gonna use the cooking
[1132.50s -> 1161.78s]  wine. I still have my food. Here we go. Presto Magesto. Jex. Mesmerized. I need to get like
[1161.78s -> 1171.99s]  three or four crits here. Do it again. Stay there. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Again. That's
[1171.99s -> 1177.83s]  a big one. That's a big one. I only gotta do this one more time. Stay, he's still confused.
[1177.83s -> 1193.46s]  Okay, here we go. Presto Magesto has worn off. Should I do? That's it. I win. What? Wait, what?
[1195.16s -> 1207.91s]  He still has health? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Oh no. No, no, no, no. He's gonna kill me.
[1208.71s -> 1224.74s]  Oh, this is bad. Please. Yes. All right, we should be safe here. End it. Stay there.
[1224.82s -> 1233.77s]  Okay, this is it. We're going all in. All in. Time to win. That's it. Glueman has fainted.
[1234.76s -> 1243.66s]  Jerma is victorious. You looted a hundred vault coins. That's a hundred bucks right there.
[1246.39s -> 1257.90s]  What a battle. That was awesome. Now what? Okay, should I? One credit or three credits?
[1258.54s -> 1271.58s]  I feel like we could make some money here. Three credits. Let's go. Three rats. What is
[1271.58s -> 1301.29s]  it to hold the rats? 20. Hold on. God damn it. Glueman, Glueman. I'm gonna lose it all.
[1307.46s -> 1319.56s]  Rat, rat, rat. That's a big hit. 15. Fuck, I spent more money trying to hold the rats.
[1324.81s -> 1329.61s]  No, don't hold them. It's more money. It's not worth it. Minus five bucks. There we go.
[1329.61s -> 1343.37s]  That's a hit. I gotta go down. I gotta drop my bet. I'll drop to two.
[1344.01s -> 1363.53s]  Shit. All right. That's okay. That's 10 bucks. Coward. I don't want to... I just got a big... I
[1363.53s -> 1375.62s]  just made a hundred vault coins. All right. Is there a pay table? Oh, look at that. There
[1375.62s -> 1381.99s]  it is. Okay. Here we go. Look. Vault coins are worth the most. A full Jupiter is worth
[1381.99s -> 1388.74s]  the second most. Yeah. All right. So the rat symbol is the reason why you've seen the
[1388.74s -> 1394.84s]  most of it is because the rat is the least special blend. So we're looking for
[1395.48s -> 1405.62s]  Jupiters and vault coins. Use the glue. Oh, look at this. Props. That's cool.
[1407.14s -> 1412.73s]  They said the rats were there. That's the glue. That's cool. There are the vault coins.
[1412.73s -> 1429.99s]  Termillionaire. Use the cheat screen. I'm not cheating yet. Vault coin, vault coin.
[1433.99s -> 1446.23s]  Shit. What is Glueman worth? That'd be 60. It's worth it. Give it to me. God damn it.
[1454.12s -> 1470.18s]  Damn it. No. I'm going to have to put a little money in. Take it down to zero. Hey,
[1470.18s -> 1483.83s]  coming back. We're not broke yet. I can't do it. I can do it with tube. It's not worth it.
[1491.59s -> 1515.13s]  Shit. Try a different machine. This one's rat infested. Life is pain. I hate...
[1517.64s -> 1532.02s]  $75 now. Well, technically $50 down. Here we go. All right. Let's bring it back.
[1533.45s -> 1553.18s]  Another one. All right. Again. Free beers. Okay. That's... Life is back in us. All right.
[1553.18s -> 1558.28s]  This is important. You ready for this shit? Hold them both. I need one more vault coin and
[1558.28s -> 1566.78s]  that's $2,500. And that's just, that's a win. That's a completion of the game. God damn it.
[1574.94s -> 1584.81s]  I got to drop the bet. Hold both these. Give me the beer. Come on. Damn it.
[1585.37s -> 1598.66s]  No. No. What? Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? Oh, I... Life is pain. I hate...
[1611.38s -> 1630.38s]  Give it to me. Oh, it's right there. It's right there. Oh, yes. All right. We got it.
[1631.10s -> 1639.14s]  We've unlocked the mini game Beer Crossing. However, this works. I'm not sure.
[1640.55s -> 1647.48s]  Burgers collected. Injured beers. Level one. What?
[1650.68s -> 1667.66s]  I have to cross the street? Five burgers. All right. What do I need? Three more?
[1668.22s -> 1682.81s]  How much time do I have? Can I go in here? Level one complete. Three burger value menus. $7.99.
[1682.81s -> 1701.16s]  Burg... I got five out of five. Let's go. Oh my God. Okay. That hurt. So that's one
[1701.16s -> 1709.08s]  injured beer. Does that take away from my money? Oh, you can see the corpses stay.
[1710.60s -> 1721.93s]  That's so funny. All right. Did I miss a burger? There's a burger down here. Wait,
[1721.93s -> 1726.68s]  I thought you said there was a burger down here. Oh, shit. There is. Okay. That's five.
[1726.68s -> 1746.50s]  I got it. It's done. Only two. Oh my God. Okay. Get across. Come on. Come on. Come on. Go,
[1746.50s -> 1761.30s]  go, go. Is that Otto? Oh, that's awesome. Hello, Otto. Any more? I think that's it. $7.99.
[1762.87s -> 1770.54s]  I missed a burger. I don't know what that was. I missed one. Level three. This is so cool.
[1771.26s -> 1784.22s]  You stay on the yellow line. White line. Whatever. Why are the hamburgers on the road?
[1784.86s -> 1809.59s]  I'm soup. There's probably eight. Seven. Oh, free the beers? Are they trapped?
[1810.55s -> 1817.56s]  They're not trapped, are they? I don't think they are. I think they're supposed to be.
[1822.36s -> 1832.10s]  Okay. All right. Slow down. They're not trapped. I can't save them. Free them.
[1832.10s -> 1844.98s]  There's no, I don't free them. They just stuck in here. All right. Hold on. Is there one more?
[1845.62s -> 1855.66s]  Here it is. Eight. Wait. You missed that one. Try another. That's so cool.
[1856.38s -> 1867.45s]  Look at all these references. 75%. I think that's it. Five injured beers. Eight out of eight
[1867.45s -> 1872.01s]  burgers even. Good. Next level. How many levels are there? Does this progressively just get
[1872.01s -> 1909.24s]  harder? There's one. Wait. No. All right. So this way. God. I'm panicking. Stop. Wait,
[1909.24s -> 1916.98s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Okay. Okay. I need way more than this. Five, six, seven,
[1917.94s -> 1933.14s]  and eight. Is it nine over there? Quickly. Get across the road. Oh, fuck.
[1937.74s -> 1940.30s]  This is so awesome because there are just so many here waiting.
[1941.18s -> 1955.30s]  The lore. The live system in this game. It makes complete sense. Oh my goodness.
[1962.58s -> 1979.03s]  This is kind of hard. All right. I'm going to slow down. I suck. I can't do it. Hold on.
[1980.58s -> 1993.51s]  He's running into the cards. I promise I'm not. All right. Safe. There's only one more to get.
[1999.38s -> 2016.79s]  Oh, fuck. Your stomach can get hit by the way. Yeah. Your stomach is a hit box. It can get
[2017.51s -> 2030.39s]  makes perfect sense. All right. I'm going to run this way and. Oh, fuck. Is there any more?
[2030.95s -> 2045.61s]  Oh, got it. Smile face. Hold on. Is there any more burgers over here?
[2046.41s -> 2059.48s]  There's Otto. Get out of the trash. Don't go in the trash. Bad dog. No more. Okay. I get 12.
[2064.84s -> 2077.74s]  12 out of 12. What the hell is this? This is a boss fight? What? Are you serious? Oh,
[2077.82s -> 2087.45s]  okay. I get it. I get it. Do I have to get burgers? I'm dead. Keep going or game sucks.
[2087.45s -> 2099.06s]  Okay. Obviously going to keep going. Shooting burgers. I got to watch out for the bullet
[2099.06s -> 2110.50s]  help. Oh my God. I got to go across the whole thing. How do I attack? Is there anything I
[2110.50s -> 2118.09s]  can do? I got to stay in the middle. What does that mean? Oh, they trap. No comes out.
[2118.09s -> 2140.98s]  Oh my goodness. This is cool. This is elaborate. All right. Watch out. I can find the right
[2140.98s -> 2156.01s]  spot to stay in. Spread them out. What's that? Tire? E. Oh, shit. I get it. Okay. This is
[2156.81s -> 2160.41s]  I have to throw tires at him probably three times like Dr. Robotnik style.
[2161.21s -> 2178.20s]  It's getting faster. Oh, God. All right. This is phase two. Just keep running in circles.
[2183.82s -> 2188.46s]  Oh, he has a, yeah. Mecha Burger Boy has a health bar. I got to hit him six times.
[2189.26s -> 2194.09s]  Oh, come on. Hurry, hurry. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Quick, quick, quick, quick.
[2194.89s -> 2202.09s]  I almost just missed. This is going to be impossible. I have to do that four more times.
[2210.25s -> 2218.06s]  Holy shit. Please play out. Oh, no. Oh, God.
[2223.38s -> 2245.88s]  Shit. Imagine this on like times five speed at the end. I was just gonna hit by that.
[2245.88s -> 2253.48s]  I completely forgotten it happened. All right. There's one. All right. Let's go.
[2254.20s -> 2291.38s]  This is going to be the rest of the stream. I'm going to beat this. Here we go. Faster.
[2291.70s -> 2307.29s]  Faster, faster, faster, faster. I'm only 500 pounds. Feed me more. Watch the fire.

[3189.29s -> 3194.73s]  That's it. Solve the puzzle. You have unlocked the advanced puzzle.
[3195.21s -> 3226.46s]  Oh, no. Oh, God. Are you kidding me? Five, 10, 15, 20. All right. Eight. I'm stuck here.
[3227.02s -> 3234.39s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three,
[3234.47s -> 3264.41s]  four, three, two, one, one, one, one. I can't believe it. Okay. Four, five, five again,
[3264.41s -> 3276.15s]  five again, five again, and then eight. Oh, God damn it, man. Eight, nine. So this is one,
[3276.15s -> 3282.46s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[3282.46s -> 3294.01s]  nine. I can't. This is fucking fantastic. One, two, three, four, five. Five is in six.
[3294.01s -> 3305.80s]  This is done. One, two, three, four, five. This is done and this is three, seven, four. One,
[3305.80s -> 3317.32s]  two, three, four. One, two, three. All right. One, two, three. One, one, one, one, one, one,
[3317.32s -> 3331.77s]  one, two, three, three. I can't believe that you actually made a pit cross level,
[3331.77s -> 3339.35s]  five, six, one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, one, one, two, three,
[3339.35s -> 3353.46s]  two three two one one one this is correct we're talking about that's done okay so now we need this
[3353.46s -> 3365.29s]  is motherfucker i swear to god one so seven how many here one two three four five six seven eight
[3365.29s -> 3376.31s]  nine ten eleven so one two three four okay so that's three let me just make sure i'm getting
[3376.31s -> 3384.54s]  this right one two three four five six seven one two three four five six seven so this is the
[3384.54s -> 3399.83s]  first one is this three one two three three one two three three what emote is this going to be
[3399.83s -> 3407.13s]  that's the question okay that's that so it's 20 by 20 so that's three
[3409.45s -> 3414.57s]  nine one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
[3416.34s -> 3421.77s]  so it can be four into the side right so one two five six seven eight nine okay
[3422.65s -> 3431.26s]  this is definitely the same thing in the middle here because they both nine one four
[3432.84s -> 3449.38s]  let me count here three six let me see what's down here this is eight seven one two three four
[3449.38s -> 3458.34s]  five six seven one two three four five six one two three four two three yeah this is correct
[3461.11s -> 3471.99s]  so this is three space this is three space it's five in the middle here five five six so one two
[3471.99s -> 3483.98s]  three four five six seven and then this is a two this is three two all right that's part of
[3483.98s -> 3493.05s]  the six that's the one so that's five one three four one two three one so it's gonna be
[3493.05s -> 3506.97s]  right here that's one excellent commentary oh i'm trying to concentrate i can't screw this up
[3509.74s -> 3516.70s]  i'm trying so hard to like pay attention one two three four one two two four one three two four
[3516.70s -> 3537.70s]  one one two three four i think i can get this though let's see no look at me is there a big
[3537.70s -> 3543.14s]  number here let's see five one three it can be somewhere over here this is part of the three
[3543.86s -> 3557.72s]  what about this way there's a nine in here a 20 by 20 of course you're gonna do that too
[3559.54s -> 3567.77s]  four let's see seven ten thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen let's see here
[3569.42s -> 3575.26s]  two nine three hold on i can i can i do this whole thing three four five six seven yes i can
[3575.98s -> 3586.30s]  this column is done so that's four then three has to be in here one two three space one one
[3586.30s -> 3598.44s]  it has to be like right here that's the one and then here's your three in here somewhere
[3598.44s -> 3604.47s]  one one two three four has to be in here somewhere okay we're getting we're making
[3604.47s -> 3622.20s]  progress now that leaves me here this is this is one of the twos one two five has to be here
[3623.16s -> 3642.68s]  there's the two there's another two so now i need a four four seven six six yeah that's done for
[3642.68s -> 3662.17s]  four this is a one in here somewhere how far away is this now this is nine so four this is
[3662.17s -> 3682.66s]  three okay don't have it yet but this has to be a two it's probably right there two two
[3683.46s -> 3689.08s]  this is one of those games you play in a retirement home kind of yeah
[3693.96s -> 3708.47s]  seven oh is wrong how is oh wrong the three has to be in here somewhere row 18 column m
[3708.47s -> 3722.70s]  what's wrong with it is you one f is wrong no you guys are getting in my head all right no
[3722.70s -> 3747.51s]  you're getting in my head fuck you can fill some of oh yeah i can two one two three four
[3747.83s -> 3758.01s]  six seven eight can't be any of these so let's see one two three four five six seven eight nine
[3758.01s -> 3787.61s]  it has to be all these one one one one this is part of four five one three four i could do
[3787.61s -> 3794.41s]  that why did i remove those crosses i don't know you're right what's what am i doing
[3794.41s -> 3805.24s]  okay here we go that helps this out one two three four five six seven eight nine
[3805.24s -> 3822.31s]  10 11 so that makes sense let me see that's one three yeah okay because this can't one two
[3822.31s -> 3831.03s]  three four five got it there's a three all right it is the three this row is done three three
[3831.75s -> 3852.76s]  one three that leaves us with let me just see here three this is it has to be three right
[3852.76s -> 3864.50s]  the middle here right and there's one three here has to be right here that's two so that's
[3864.50s -> 3888.92s]  three three one three four this is two two two this is one of the fours two it would be here
[3888.92s -> 3899.78s]  it kind of has to be here right why not i messed up row 18 how no it's fine it's not
[3899.78s -> 3912.71s]  messed up i can do this again here though because the same amount there's one okay three
[3912.71s -> 3931.74s]  because this is nine what about here row 18 is done i knew that bingo now here's okay okay
[3931.74s -> 3937.83s]  wait wait wait wait so this has to be here this is okay i got it wait wait it's calm down calm
[3937.83s -> 3944.44s]  down two right here this can't be down here because this row is now done therefore
[3944.44s -> 3957.94s]  this is the two this is the three this row is done we're getting there close four three one
[3957.94s -> 3969.42s]  five three three we're good that means what does that mean three one three i'm not gonna
[3972.47s -> 3984.47s]  somebody just gave 50 bucks who just gave money uh magical marissa gave 60 dollars and says you
[3984.47s -> 3991.08s]  should probably hire someone else to do this puzzle no i can do this thank you for the 50
[3991.08s -> 4004.76s]  bucks and then 10 bucks right before it's 60 dollars from magical marissa thank you that's a
[4004.76s -> 4012.39s]  ton of money really appreciate it i can't rush through i can't rush through this seriously
[4012.39s -> 4016.55s]  because like i if i fuck up one thing i have to go all the way back and it's gonna ruin
[4016.55s -> 4034.94s]  everything but 60 bucks thank you so much that's an absolute shit load of money four hold on wait
[4034.94s -> 4046.17s]  i'm just checking four one two he's so good at what he does two two one four that's the
[4046.17s -> 4063.74s]  whole row is done i'm gonna break the mr mosquito disk in fucking half okay here we go
[4063.74s -> 4074.25s]  one three can't be here because that's one two right easy slow down that's the one this is
[4074.25s -> 4094.23s]  done done one nine here we go one two three four five six seven eight nine two that's done
[4099.26s -> 4113.10s]  one two nine one okay and then that's done there's your two all right hold on slow down
[4113.10s -> 4123.62s]  one two how many twos are here there's one two three four there's four twos and then
[4123.62s -> 4128.58s]  then this so there's four twos in here so you got one two can't be there it's got to
[4128.58s -> 4147.78s]  be like that two two two all right that's all i know okay seven can i put any more in here
[4147.78s -> 4156.46s]  i don't think so what we got this is four one four so this is okay all the twos are done so
[4156.46s -> 4160.78s]  this these are both fours so this has to be like this what the fuck is that

[6942.06s -> 6952.71s]  well the perfect bia game okay like it turns better don't tell them it's i'll try to press
[6952.71s -> 6976.18s]  the service button all right so start looking on the floor yeah all right that's fucking amazing
[6976.66s -> 6994.84s]  okay where are those actually where are they about the author a snake in the clouds what else is in
[6994.84s -> 7004.57s]  there i can't see there's something underneath it is it a snake it's my children's book
[7012.38s -> 7021.06s]  oh there it is it's my book okay so the other achievements are yeah i can't hit the
[7021.06s -> 7027.40s]  service button so the other achievements are to perfect the bia game and then to get 10 000
[7027.96s -> 7048.33s]  organically that was awesome i missed a giant jupiter where organically we don't have time
[7048.33s -> 7055.80s]  for organically i don't think you need to do it organically uh not a perfect bia run just
[7055.80s -> 7076.23s]  all the burgers okay i see uh cad uh cad vip that is fucking oh this is great this is like a
[7076.23s -> 7086.20s]  solid hour and a half two hours worth of like game content and you and i are gonna probably
[7086.28s -> 7097.18s]  have a little discussion after the stream here because this is like this is next level uh-oh
[7097.18s -> 7106.33s]  he's in trouble was it the short joke you know you're not gonna have a little bit of
[7106.33s -> 7116.79s]  convo about some of these things and i uh i well there's a bunch of people here to talk
[7116.79s -> 7121.58s]  about it i was supposed to today if you didn't you missed what happened earlier i was going
[7121.58s -> 7131.16s]  to do a scratch ticket for charity thing and this but um there's no state lottery in nevada
[7131.16s -> 7136.28s]  it doesn't exist scratch tickets do not exist in nevada and it was a major massive oversight
[7136.28s -> 7145.14s]  on my part for not assuming that there was no state lottery in nevada i had no idea i'm from
[7145.14s -> 7150.07s]  massachusetts originally i was under the impression i could walk into a gas station
[7150.07s -> 7157.53s]  and just buy uh but so i know that is pretty ironic it is so what's going to happen here is
[7158.33s -> 7164.33s]  there's a couple of scratch ticket things that i can do possibly but for the immediate future
[7164.33s -> 7170.87s]  i'm just going to give two hundred and twenty one dollars to the nevada humane society so
[7170.87s -> 7176.15s]  retroactively we're just going to say that each death in securo was a dollar so that's
[7176.15s -> 7183.70s]  just going to happen and if i can somehow figure out a way to do that with actually
[7183.78s -> 7190.34s]  getting tickets i was a little disappointed today but mr mosquito was a lot of fun until
[7190.34s -> 7198.17s]  i broke the disc and then this was incredible so i'm very happy 221 not two dollars and 21
[7199.62s -> 7204.20s]  yeah there's also like that i could do have somebody send them to me and then like i just
[7204.20s -> 7212.41s]  cash them out in that state later there's a couple of ways but just for the immediate
[7212.41s -> 7216.90s]  future to wrap up like the securo thing because that was to wrap up securo so i'm
[7216.90s -> 7223.74s]  just going to donate the money so for the purposes of the rest of tonight i'm going to
[7223.74s -> 7231.42s]  take a break uh and we'll come back and i'll just chill we'll probably just hang out might put in
[7231.98s -> 7240.60s]  might put in uh there's a couple of options here i don't know if i want to do i'm not sure
[7240.60s -> 7243.85s]  if i want to do monster rancher 4 because i'm probably only going to stream for like
[7243.85s -> 7247.98s]  another hour so i think we're just going to come back and just chill and like i'll turn
[7247.98s -> 7264.41s]  the camera around let's talk and hang out as it means i gotta go put clothes on more mr
[7264.41s -> 7272.94s]  mosquito no i that was that became that gave me angry but we'll figure it out maybe
[7272.94s -> 7277.54s]  we'll do something else i'll be back and we'll hang out for a little while longer before i turn
[7277.54s -> 7284.95s]  off the stream see you guys in like two minutes three minutes just keep the music playing why
[7287.37s -> 7294.62s]  if you take it off uh i'm i'll see you in a couple days i'm gonna take uh two days off
[7294.62s -> 7302.39s]  so i'll be back on what's today i'll see you on saturday sunday see you on tuesday
[7302.39s -> 7310.01s]  but for those of you sticking around um by the way next week is vr so i'm gonna get back
[7310.01s -> 7315.40s]  into vr probably start with mind show maybe or end with mind show geoguesser i could do
[7315.40s -> 7321.43s]  geoguesser we could just hang out and play it but uh those of you that are sticking around i'll see
[7321.43s -> 7323.96s]  you very soon be right back
