[1.02s -> 12.50s]  Hello, good afternoon or good morning, those of you on the west coast, like me. How are you?
[12.50s -> 25.24s]  We are back again. Fun filled day of streaming on twitch.tv. People are calling me a liar already.
[25.24s -> 33.27s]  I haven't even spoken. I haven't even talked yet. Can you read my mind? Can you read my lie mind?
[33.27s -> 44.10s]  I'm a lied about house flipper. We're playing desperados three today. Don't exactly know where
[44.10s -> 58.84s]  you're getting that from. I'm checking on you. Take off the diaper. Hold on. What? Look,
[59.64s -> 64.97s]  click link, click link. I don't want to. What is this? I don't want to click this.
[65.69s -> 78.82s]  What is this? I don't think so. When does that? When does a house flippers DLC come up?
[78.82s -> 87.91s]  No, I didn't. They're doing like an HGTV thing, right? Is that out? I gotta fucking play this.
[88.55s -> 92.23s]  All right. All right. All right. Right. How about this? I'll give you a date on Wednesday,
[92.23s -> 101.02s]  the 19th of August. I will play house flippers, HGTV, fucking DLC. Okay. It doesn't matter what
[101.02s -> 107.16s]  the fuck I'm doing on Wednesday. Whatever it is, it's off the table. That's in like a few weeks.
[107.16s -> 115.77s]  Okay. Well, whatever. I was going to, I really wanted to play desperados three today.
[115.77s -> 124.95s]  That's it's off the table now. Right. It's today, the 19th. Today's the night. All right.
[124.95s -> 129.43s]  You promised you promised. All right. All right. I don't, whatever. If I'm going to be held to my
[129.43s -> 138.70s]  word, which I hope I am, I'm going to play house flippers, HGTV, DLC. I got to be held to my word.
[140.15s -> 147.06s]  All right. Well, I had this whole cowboy costume over here that I was going to put on today.
[147.06s -> 160.76s]  Are you sure? I do. Okay. Looks like I'm just going to return it while you play house flippers.
[162.04s -> 169.90s]  That would just be odd. Why would I be dressed up as a cowboy? I guess I'm that's I just maybe
[169.90s -> 188.89s]  I'm just a cowboy. Who cares? Turn your cam on. Turn your cam on. I why make a cowboy house?
[189.61s -> 199.78s]  No, that's too easy. That's too easy. Put on comedy. Hold on. I got to, I got to change the
[199.78s -> 208.47s]  title. God, you know, I got to be held to my promises about it's HGTV, right? TV ready homes.
[208.47s -> 225.91s]  Is that good? TV ready homes, house flipper. Good thing I own this shit already. Good thing. I
[225.91s -> 234.17s]  already own this DLC about the whole thing. I bought everything. Yeah. And don't let, let,
[234.17s -> 239.29s]  I want you to show people this when they say this dude doesn't do what he says. He does. He
[239.29s -> 244.01s]  does not go back on his word. If he says he's going to play a game, he's going to play it.
[244.01s -> 249.30s]  Like he, if he says he's going to play a game tomorrow, he's going to do it.
[249.30s -> 256.78s]  Just get this open. Hold on. All right. Let's, let's go. We're going to play house flippers.
[256.78s -> 267.05s]  DLC play saw then I never promised anything with saw. So I had no promises. Hey, look,
[267.05s -> 275.50s]  there it is. House flipper. You guys remember this game? Oh, well, let's take a look around our,
[275.82s -> 281.26s]  a double. He's a double liar, but he can do resident evil four. That's probably never going
[281.26s -> 290.62s]  to happen unless it's on the Wii. The PC one I thought was going to make me sick, but hey,
[290.62s -> 296.79s]  take a look at this, right? Oh, let's get it. Uh, those last time we played house flipper, HGTV.
[296.79s -> 301.19s]  Well, this is the house. This is garden flipper. Actually. Last time we played this, I made this
[301.19s -> 314.62s]  sick garden. Remember this is the old house. I don't know why I just, I thought just said
[314.70s -> 323.24s]  or wallet out like dump money in here. This is pretty sick. Oh yeah. Right. It's the family guy
[323.24s -> 335.88s]  house. This is supposed to be the Griffin house. I forgot. This is an expensive ass house. What
[335.88s -> 341.50s]  else? What else is back here? Oh yeah. The AOL. Oh, right. The projector, right? We're going to,
[341.50s -> 346.54s]  it's going to be movie night. You can come park and watch TV, make pizzas. I forgot about this
[346.54s -> 355.18s]  game. I love this game. All right, let's go. There's a kiddie pool, another pond with some seagulls,
[355.18s -> 368.76s]  picnic table. What else is back here? The grill, right? Nice. That's a pretty good gamer. That's a
[368.76s -> 382.54s]  gamer fridge. That's a huge gamer fridge. Stove. Here are the seats. And don't, aren't these
[382.54s -> 386.22s]  actually connected to plumbing too, by the way? Those even give you, you think this is just a
[386.22s -> 394.28s]  funny joke for the stream. So there's actual plumbing down here. I remember that. Big bean bag
[394.28s -> 402.73s]  chair. It's a cool color scheme. I forgot about this. I gotta, let me look around. Oh yeah. There's
[402.73s -> 413.27s]  two toilets. I gotta remember this. This is my, this is my design philosophy. Eat while you shit,
[413.27s -> 420.54s]  technically. Why are there three sinks? Because it's like a public restroom. What the hell is
[420.54s -> 429.13s]  going on up here? Oh, that's right. The pool was too expensive. So I made just one of those
[429.85s -> 442.02s]  swim forward while the current tries to take you machines. Oh, this is where it happened, right?
[442.02s -> 448.28s]  This is where it was. I feel like if it's an old historic house, like an old streamer house,
[448.28s -> 455.54s]  this is where he did the worst impression of 2018. Yeah. I remember it. It was right here. Wow.
[455.54s -> 473.50s]  This is super historic. All right. Let's keep going. Let's go do the new, uh, DLC. Where is it?
[473.50s -> 484.46s]  Okay. Map of jobs. This is not realistic. That number is not 580. Boy, they give you like a
[484.46s -> 499.85s]  Sims map now. HGTV. Is this like a, this is, but they're not like, are there police over here?
[500.33s -> 515.29s]  Why is there police everywhere? Okay. Is this the one? Job, a new beginning. Welcome to your
[515.29s -> 519.85s]  first job in Sunset Bay. Are you ready to help John and Nicole renovate the house of their dreams?
[519.85s -> 524.57s]  While the house is small, the view is amazing. You'll have to make some decisions when it comes
[524.57s -> 530.94s]  to room arrangement. The shack under the house is especially problematic. Good luck. There's four
[530.94s -> 544.23s]  people buried there. Only got 6,500 bucks. Go to the Simpsons house. Omega-Lel, his fucking brain.
[544.23s -> 556.42s]  Omega-Lel, Omega-Lel. What the fuck? But I'm going to record myself be saying I'm going to
[556.42s -> 560.42s]  play house with my 19th. And then you guys can click link to it. I'll be like, fuck, right. Well,
[560.42s -> 567.67s]  sorry guys. You know, okay. Here's the thing. Really? Like they teach like this type of photo
[567.67s -> 576.23s]  manipulation in the fourth grade now. Really guys? You honestly, this is like, you can do this in 15
[576.23s -> 581.19s]  seconds. In fact, it took you a while to do that. Actually it's been 10 minutes and we get this now.
[581.19s -> 603.88s]  Okay. So yeah, so fake. Omega-Lel doctored. He's not wrong, chat. Are these people on HGTV?
[604.44s -> 617.29s]  Is this a show? Are these people on a show on HGTV? Or did HGTV just hand their logo to the
[617.29s -> 623.99s]  house flipper guys and just said, yeah, just put it on there. What does this have to do with HGTV?
[624.55s -> 629.24s]  Okay. Welcome to your first job. Are you ready to help John and Nicole renovate the house of
[629.24s -> 636.97s]  their dreams? Oh yeah. Okay. I got 6,500 bucks. I got 6,500 dollars. This is what I have to work
[636.97s -> 642.36s]  with. When you work on jobs in Sunset Bay, there is a specific budget defined for each one. It's
[642.36s -> 646.92s]  the amount of money that the family is willing to spend on their dream house. Remember to stay
[646.92s -> 660.57s]  within the budget while renovating. Oh, their dream house. What a dream house. Wait, did you guys
[660.57s -> 666.84s]  start the renovation and then just dad just kind of started living out here? What the fuck is this?
[666.84s -> 677.06s]  6,500 bucks. All right. What this looks like is this looks like like dad built this part of the
[677.06s -> 683.78s]  house himself and we have like a Hansel and Gretel trail of how he started to get really exhausted
[683.78s -> 690.38s]  and fucked the whole thing up. It led into here and then he got like shitfaced and threw the
[690.38s -> 698.04s]  remaining wood into the shed. I can't do this. I'm already like 80 grand in the hole. Get the HGTV
[698.04s -> 706.50s]  guys to come. Just have them come fix it. Just look, I promise I'll cry when you reveal the house
[706.50s -> 729.30s]  if you come and do it, please. I promise I'll do a massive Pog face when you reveal. I'll freak out.
[729.30s -> 737.19s]  I'll sprint in a circle and scream. I'll take my shirt off and just sprint around yelling. I'll
[737.19s -> 755.21s]  take both my hands and grab the Camberman's lens, pull it in and go. Yeah, 6,500 bucks. This doesn't
[755.21s -> 766.22s]  cost any money, right? Keep your shirt on TOS. This is not me doing this. Okay, so I have to
[766.22s -> 774.10s]  what do they want? Look at the tablet for a second. All right, first floor. Remove the trash.
[775.21s -> 784.41s]  Make a decision in room 4M squared. Clean dirt. Okay, make a decision. Let's go make a decision.
[784.41s -> 796.22s]  What room does it want me to do? Okay, there's a lot of bugs in this house. What decision do they
[796.22s -> 803.32s]  want? Okay, make a decision. Definitely a TV. The room feels so empty without it. We can also add
[803.32s -> 809.06s]  some decorations, a carpet, and a few potted plants. A fireplace could make this room feel
[809.06s -> 814.02s]  more complete. A large corner electric fireplace. No, no, no, no. I don't care. I'm not doing an
[814.02s -> 820.86s]  electric fireplace. No way. I don't even care what the other one is. I'm sorry, guys. Something about
[820.86s -> 827.50s]  flicking a switch and fire starts in my house. I don't want that. That's dangerous to me. You
[827.50s -> 835.53s]  don't flick a switch and your oven goes to 500 degrees. Nope. I wouldn't want that either. All
[835.53s -> 845.22s]  right, let's clean. Easy. Yes, you would. I would not want that. That's terrifying. Who wants an
[845.22s -> 855.00s]  oven that if you hit the on button is instantly 500 degrees? That's terrifying. All right, hold
[855.00s -> 862.89s]  on. A living room. Chandelier with bulbs. Let's get rid of this fucking thing. What do you want
[862.89s -> 875.96s]  to do with it? Remove object. Oh, okay. Wardrobe Drenemo. Is this a wardrobe Drenemo? Which one?
[875.96s -> 893.83s]  This one? Let's clean this place up first. What? Why is everybody flicking things? What is all this?
[896.70s -> 902.25s]  Okay, hold on. I need to go over this because this is fucking me up. This is freaking me out.
[902.25s -> 914.18s]  I need to go over this. Address it. Address it. Address it. Address it. Just hold on. I'm
[914.18s -> 926.12s]  going to address it. That's not it. Yeah, I did it. Yeah, whatever. That's me addressing it. All
[926.12s -> 931.70s]  right. Well, let me see. I don't even know what this is. What the fuck is this? Shit. What do I
[931.70s -> 938.15s]  even save it as? All right. Address it. Address it. Address it. Address it. I'm addressing it.
[942.50s -> 948.74s]  Easy Bake Hard Mode. Why are you watching that? Okay, here we go. Let me shrink this a little bit.
[949.30s -> 959.64s]  Dremeloogs. A fake website. What is that website? I don't want that website. I don't want my logs.
[961.05s -> 965.69s]  I don't know what to delete. That's a good one. What if you just tell the truth? Yeah, I mean,
[965.69s -> 971.80s]  that's true. Play disk skipping noises. Say I dropped it down the stairs. Floppy disk sounds.
[971.80s -> 977.48s]  Ha ha ha. That's so stupid. Yeah, say you heard it. I showed it off on Periscope.
[977.48s -> 985.40s]  Ah, no shit. Okay, hold on. This is like next level faking people's with it saying,
[985.40s -> 990.23s]  I'm going to record myself and play house flipper. Yeah. Inspect element. Yeah. And then you guys can
[990.23s -> 993.19s]  link to it. Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. I'll get a good one. Okay. I'm rendering the clip. I need
[993.19s -> 1000.78s]  to Twitch clip of this. I mean, you guys are really, you guys are really trying at this point,
[1000.78s -> 1008.12s]  but the fake website, the fake fucking text, the fake everything, fake text, inspect element. Yeah,
[1008.12s -> 1016.57s]  it was fake. I don't even need to inspect element. I got fucking online x-ray vision.
[1016.57s -> 1024.14s]  Just wait till they make that shit. Just wait till you're going to have to have online x-ray
[1024.14s -> 1027.74s]  vision. It's a button like an extension you're going to have to play to see like if the website's
[1027.74s -> 1040.63s]  even fucking real. We're getting real fucked up in 10 years. It's a nice bathtub. Link spam. Funny
[1040.63s -> 1049.22s]  link. Nah, whatever. All right. Let me, I got a living room. I have $300,000. Why do I need $6,500?
[1049.22s -> 1055.03s]  Okay. Where's this wardrobe? Is this a wardrobe? What is this? This is a wardrobe, right? Well,
[1055.03s -> 1061.74s]  it's ugly. Get rid of it. Right. Wardrobe. All right. There we go. Clean the windows. Oh,
[1061.74s -> 1080.57s]  this is my favorite part of this game. I fucking love this. Oh, it just does it for me. Oh yeah.
[1080.57s -> 1095.34s]  Thermal. That was real. It's a hundred percent real. You're a liar. Ask me if I'm a liar again.
[1095.34s -> 1111.34s]  Say, did you say, did you lie about the clip? What's the question? Did I lie about the clip?
[1111.34s -> 1116.78s]  Well, the thing is we have to take care of everybody. We have to make sure that we get
[1116.78s -> 1123.98s]  down with our hands dirty and we get everybody on the right page. I also think that we can make
[1123.98s -> 1138.98s]  it happen as long as you stick with me. There you go. Here's your answer. Senator Albertson,
[1138.98s -> 1147.56s]  have you ever eaten glass for fun? Here's the thing. My favorite dog that I've ever had
[1147.56s -> 1155.37s]  was little Fido. And I'll tell you, he was a good dog. I'm a good dog. And if I can be your senator
[1155.37s -> 1166.23s]  again, I would be such a good boy. Senator Albertson, is there a, is there a full shit
[1166.23s -> 1174.12s]  in your underwear right fucking now, right now? Yes or no. You know, the tricky thing about trying
[1174.12s -> 1185.14s]  to fix this country is just my goodness. We got to get everybody back to work. I will yield the rest
[1185.14s -> 1207.19s]  of my time. He has my vote. You can't yield time in an interview. Yes, you can. It's called,
[1207.19s -> 1213.90s]  I'm just going to stop talking and stare at the camera until they ask another question. Turn that
[1213.90s -> 1228.26s]  off. I hate ovens. You get interviewed and you say I'm doing the fifth amendment. Mr. Albertson,
[1228.26s -> 1233.14s]  I just want to ask about the potential controversy where you chugged an entire Gatorade as fast as
[1233.14s -> 1236.50s]  you could on camera for a bunch of people. And you thought it was like funny. And then you like
[1236.50s -> 1263.30s]  burped really loud. Mr. Albertson, what can you tell me about school? Well, think about school.
[1263.30s -> 1266.34s]  We got to really get in there and I'm going to change everything about, we got to get, we got
[1266.34s -> 1276.46s]  to reform our schools. We got to make sure everyone's prepared. Absolutely. Mr. Albertson,
[1276.46s -> 1295.61s]  there's a video of you punching a guy in the face at a bar in downtown Boston. You did that
[1295.61s -> 1310.50s]  fucking all day. I just like fucking, I should like, all right, I got to play the game of like
[1310.50s -> 1317.53s]  getting to the sidetrack. All right. Adam Chandler, TV corner cabinet. What's a TV corner cabinet?
[1317.53s -> 1321.86s]  All right. Well, where's, where's the couch? This is way too far away. You can't see shit from here.
[1321.86s -> 1329.13s]  You want the TV over here? Uh, wait, next to the people are going to be like walking in the way
[1329.13s -> 1338.47s]  and shit. Why would you ever want that? You want an Adam Chandler. Okay. Well, let's put the TV in
[1338.47s -> 1344.44s]  the shitty place they want it. Clean this. Wait, there's one more window I didn't clean. I forgot
[1344.44s -> 1359.91s]  one window. I forgot. Where is it? It's got ADHD. Yeah. Oh shit. Fuck. I actually answered the
[1359.91s -> 1365.98s]  question. No, I was supposed to tell you how we were going to fix our schools. Shit. Oh well.
[1366.62s -> 1383.90s]  Place object. All right. What do we got? TV. Buy. Buy many. $700. How big is this thing?
[1386.87s -> 1401.29s]  This is 700 bucks. Okay. Well, we'll figure it out later. What a terrible setup. Now I know this
[1401.29s -> 1408.34s]  setup. I know this exact setup. This is, I just moved into a new place and two months later,
[1408.34s -> 1412.66s]  still kind of don't give a shit about this. And it's a pain in the ass, but I'm still, I'm going
[1412.66s -> 1418.04s]  to do it. I don't even care. Yeah. Eventually I'll get something to put that on, but like,
[1418.04s -> 1428.46s]  I don't care. I will maybe. Thanks for being with us. That's a pretty cool like streamer end card.
[1428.46s -> 1442.25s]  Okay. So now I need a TV corner cabinet. Is that what this is? Okay. What color? All right. How
[1442.25s -> 1457.99s]  about just bright red? Wait, that would be infuriating. Okay. Imagine buying this and
[1457.99s -> 1461.88s]  this is the place that you really thought it was going to be. And your heart was set on this.
[1461.88s -> 1470.38s]  And now you go, no, I didn't measure it right. Fuck I have, but it has to stay. I'll have to
[1470.38s -> 1476.78s]  deal with it. I'll deal with it. I'll just deal with it. You hate it every day, but you know what?
[1476.78s -> 1480.06s]  You're going to buy a new one, return it, have them, the guys that brought this thing in,
[1480.06s -> 1486.10s]  you're going to have them bring it out. No, you have to deal with it. God moving sucks.
[1486.10s -> 1503.74s]  So does this, by the way, this sucks. What is it? Who's who can watch this? You have to be sitting
[1503.74s -> 1508.50s]  here. Wait, no, I get it. Okay. So wait, nevermind. I thought this is a bathroom. I was going to say
[1508.50s -> 1519.16s]  that makes sense. It's fine. This isn't, this is not fine. Why would you sit at a viewing angle
[1519.16s -> 1525.35s]  permanently at like 30, 40 degrees? This is not fine. You have to sit here and like watch the TV.
[1525.35s -> 1553.56s]  No, you need to be facing forward, facing Adam chandelier. Okay. You want two of these. This is
[1553.56s -> 1565.35s]  like, uh, you can't even, I can't even, whatever. All right. What do you want this? A rectangular
[1565.35s -> 1578.74s]  carpet. Let's do gray. Gray goes with everything. I don't, I don't like how this is set up. How are
[1578.74s -> 1588.15s]  you supposed to sit here and eat dinner? You can't like sit there and eat dinner on this. How do you
[1588.15s -> 1596.23s]  only work in gray scale? You design, it's a, this is a living room. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1596.23s -> 1603.46s]  I'm sorry. I am going to tell you guys the age of sitting at the dining table is over. Us,
[1603.46s -> 1610.10s]  the younger generation, that shit's over. The new dinner table is the coffee table in front of the
[1610.10s -> 1617.94s]  TV. They're a dinner table for what? To throw all your mail, to like stack a bunch of shit.
[1617.94s -> 1623.50s]  And then you get pissed off in six months when there's shit all over the table. Dining room table
[1623.50s -> 1631.30s]  is just totally like 2010 and before. This is the new dinner table. Everybody gets out, sits in on
[1631.30s -> 1635.30s]  the table, on the couch. Everyone's just eating off the, everyone's like, yeah, put it on, put
[1635.30s -> 1640.81s]  SpongeBob on. It's like, oh, I love it. I watch you. Do you know what I watch? I watch, am I weird?
[1640.81s -> 1649.29s]  Let me ask you this. So this is a YouTube channel. It's called The Wolf Pit and the guy reviews like
[1649.29s -> 1659.30s]  frozen, like $1 dinners and TV dinners and stuff. And I watch this guy when I eat food. He's like
[1659.30s -> 1663.38s]  going over how like disgusting it is and like, oh, this is like a $1 TV dinner I got from like
[1663.38s -> 1668.73s]  the dollar store or something. And I'm just eating food going, oh, cool. Am I weird? Does that make
[1668.73s -> 1679.22s]  me a weird person? Yes. It doesn't matter what I'm eating. I could be eating like McDonald's or I
[1679.22s -> 1683.74s]  could be eating like a steak. It doesn't, it doesn't matter what it is. I'm going to watch this channel.
[1683.74s -> 1690.01s]  All right. We know two of those. Where'd you, why would you want, oh, underneath the table.
[1690.01s -> 1704.98s]  That's never going to get used. And then a Zamiya plant. Okay. I want, why many? Dude. All right.
[1704.98s -> 1708.58s]  Can I tell you something about big plants? I'm really telling you something about stuff today,
[1708.58s -> 1718.28s]  huh? Let me tell you something about X. I think these just get in the way. They look cool, I guess,
[1718.28s -> 1725.10s]  but I feel like they just get in the way. Where am I? What do I put this? What's this? What? This
[1725.10s -> 1730.15s]  is just clearly just in the way. You're going to, something's going to be on this table and you're
[1730.15s -> 1734.68s]  going to bump into this once and it's going to infuriate you. What do you do with this?
[1734.68s -> 1749.11s]  It's a Seinfeld joke. Hey, Seinfeld is a legendary show. All right. That doesn't bother me. All right.
[1749.11s -> 1757.06s]  Living room. We got it. Progress. I have $4,900 left. Okay. Let's keep doing this. Second floor,
[1757.06s -> 1762.23s]  living room with kitchenette, garden, remove the trash. All right. You want to make a decision in
[1762.23s -> 1767.75s]  this room down here. Let's go. This is fine. Look, we're trying to make a little bit more,
[1767.75s -> 1779.54s]  make the bed. I shouldn't have even done that. Who makes beds? My pillows are just on the ground
[1779.54s -> 1785.94s]  every single night and I just pick them back up and go back and go to bed. Yeah. You're a slob.
[1785.94s -> 1795.61s]  Yeah. Yeah. Whatever. Wasn't there one down here? Okay. Make a decision. Sauna and a bathroom. Being
[1795.61s -> 1800.55s]  able to hop in the sauna. What? You can make a sauna? Just cleaning it up will suffice. This is
[1800.55s -> 1808.94s]  a very capable storage room. Isn't the sauna expensive? How much is a sauna? Are you sure?
[1809.02s -> 1812.06s]  Why am I getting, who wants to be a millionaire? This is too, this is too much money.
[1812.06s -> 1831.10s]  Why would you want a sauna down here? That's actually weird. Isn't that strange? What's this
[1831.10s -> 1843.42s]  guy do down here? Oh, I got to clean. Hey, an anonymous gifter. Thanks for the five subs and
[1843.42s -> 1851.32s]  atmosphere starfish. Thanks for the five subs as well. What is he building in here? I don't know,
[1851.32s -> 1862.71s]  man. Can I just sell this whole thing? Yeah, I can. What am I doing? Can't sell trash though.
[1862.71s -> 1868.36s]  You can now finish incomplete jobs. I'm going to finish it. Wait, they ordered a sauna and I get
[1868.36s -> 1873.70s]  to just leave? Yeah. And I think down here I want it to be red. And I think over here,
[1873.70s -> 1877.86s]  the wall should be gray. Put a couple of carpets down. We want a sauna down here. Okay.
[1880.33s -> 1891.05s]  Let's just leave. And I never come back. I gave up. Guys, I gave up on you when you wanted
[1891.05s -> 1903.93s]  TV in the corner. That stupid thing. I need a dining table. All right. That's it for the trash.
[1903.93s -> 1915.14s]  Four dollars and 42 cents. All right. Literally all city contractors. So what do I need a sledgehammer
[1915.22s -> 1926.86s]  for? I don't even have, why do I not have a sledgehammer? Lay floor tiles. Where's my
[1926.86s -> 1942.55s]  sledgehammer? 80, 100. Where's my sledgehammer? I sold the sledgehammer. No, that's not how that
[1942.55s -> 1952.18s]  works though. Sink plumb. Oh, maybe I don't have to do it. Okay. Scenic sauna heater. That's a sauna
[1952.18s -> 1971.94s]  operate. Sauna. Scenic sauna heater. This is 420 bucks. All right. Where does this go? Lay floor
[1971.94s -> 1983.24s]  tiles. Oh, I need floor tiles. Okay. Hold on. What do they want for tiles? Floor tiles. What do you
[1983.24s -> 1989.42s]  think would look good in a sauna? That's my opinion on rhinos. They're very dangerous. They're
[1989.42s -> 1997.99s]  very cool though. They can go very fast. Oh, I like the gray bubble tiles. What do you guys think?
[1997.99s -> 2008.82s]  Fuck. I do like gray, huh? I can't help it. It just, I like it. It goes with everything.
[2008.82s -> 2032.50s]  I have a Squidward house. It's fine. Ceramic brown rectangles. Oh no. We've spent the money already.
[2032.50s -> 2041.93s]  Wait, can I sell it? Can I sell it? How much do I sell it for? Oh no. I have to go over the tiles
[2041.93s -> 2054.86s]  with other tiles. Great. What the hell was it called? Floor tiles. Whatever. Where is it brown?
[2054.86s -> 2075.34s]  What? Ceramic tiles brown. What? Why is this wrong? Floor panel dark? Hold on. What is going on?
[2075.34s -> 2079.83s]  Wait, it's different rooms. I thought this whole thing was a sauna. I was going to put a toilet
[2079.83s -> 2088.55s]  here. Okay. Brown rectangles. I don't even have the right thing. Yes, I do. Okay. Here we go.
[2088.55s -> 2099.21s]  All right. There we are. Going a little over budget, but it happens. Which room is this one?
[2099.21s -> 2115.69s]  Is this brown tile inside? Okay. Floor panel dark. Just wait till I can make my own house.
[2115.69s -> 2142.86s]  Poop line sauna. What was it called? Dark. Floor panel dark. Is this the my summer house sauna?
[2142.86s -> 2148.52s]  You know, somebody said to play that game. It's been significantly updated or something
[2148.52s -> 2159.06s]  since the last time I played it. All right. There we go. Now I need the scenic sauna heater.
[2159.06s -> 2178.90s]  Okay. Which one is the sauna? This is the sauna. Okay. Sauna bench. Sauna bench. Okay. What about
[2178.90s -> 2193.61s]  the galaxy? What about the galaxy brain sauna heater? Isn't that one better? Wait, I need two
[2193.61s -> 2204.12s]  of these. Okay. You sit down here. Corner sauna bench. Sauna bucket with ladle. There's not room
[2204.12s -> 2219.51s]  for this stuff in here. Oh yeah. Right. Cause you go with the on the rocks, right? Right. Sauna bench.
[2219.51s -> 2238.82s]  No, no, that's not right. Sauna. Sauna. Corner bench. Why do you need this? Are this many people
[2238.82s -> 2245.29s]  going to sit in here like naked? I don't understand. How many people do you want to come in here?
[2245.29s -> 2256.97s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, six people in here. This is a one person sauna. Another corner
[2256.97s -> 2276.20s]  sauna bench. Look, we'll just stadium seated like they do somewhere there. You're going to sit up
[2276.20s -> 2280.28s]  here and your legs are going to be just dangling down here. And there's a guy going to be sitting
[2280.28s -> 2290.30s]  right here. This doesn't work. Can I put a sign up that says like must wear clothes? Like, can I
[2290.30s -> 2298.76s]  probably like must be fully clothed or something? What do you mean? No, you don't have to go into a
[2298.76s -> 2305.16s]  sauna nude. You can go in there and like a bathing suit, bathing suit, a bathing suits appreciated
[2305.16s -> 2313.59s]  with an asterisks and you have to get clothes and it says required. Okay. And then we need a lamp
[2319.70s -> 2335.35s]  lamp. Okay. And somebody can sit on this. I can't even turn it. Oh no, it's supposed to go up. Okay.
[2335.35s -> 2351.00s]  I see. Ooh, wait, that's not even on. Oh, nice. Okay. Jeremy, since you're keeping your word,
[2351.48s -> 2356.94s]  should you play eternal darkness? He said, yeah, I missed it. Okay. This one, this is done.
[2357.50s -> 2368.97s]  Sauna is done. I'm probably doing all my money. 4,300. Shower plumbing system. Wait, you can
[2368.97s -> 2380.70s]  actually do this now? Oh, I was going to wait. Why is there a shower here? A shower next to the sauna?
[2389.30s -> 2396.25s]  Okay. I guess so. Of course, dude. Isn't that too much money though? Like you have a shower just
[2396.25s -> 2408.17s]  upstairs. Use your shower up there. Buy a shower and mount it. Toilet plumbing system. Wait a minute.
[2408.17s -> 2422.97s]  I don't hold on. So this is just a toilet. Why can't you see through this? There's no door here.
[2423.61s -> 2440.17s]  Hey guys. Okay. Sink plumbing system. What do you mean sink plumbing? Why do you need all this stuff?
[2446.41s -> 2460.52s]  I don't agree with this sauna field. I don't know. What's the point of having this bathroom?
[2460.52s -> 2474.89s]  I cannot do it now. We'll think out, you know, when houses have four and a half or like five
[2474.89s -> 2482.60s]  and a half bathrooms for some reason, like what do you pick a day of the week to go shit in each one?
[2482.60s -> 2496.74s]  I mean, no. You guys never heard of like a three, four, five bathrooms? Yes. How do you
[2496.74s -> 2503.29s]  have half a bathroom? Do I? I think you're messing around. Okay. Messing around. All right.
[2503.29s -> 2522.39s]  Mountable shower idiom. Okay. This is what they want. Wait, isn't there supposed to be a toilet
[2522.39s -> 2535.94s]  here? This is going to fit over here. Wait, what's this for? There's not going to be any room.
[2535.94s -> 2565.32s]  That's the sink. Uh, assemble it. Okay. Oh, dude. How do I assemble it? Is there something I'm missing?
[2565.32s -> 2576.89s]  You, you broke the shower because it's like, cause it's hovering. It's like a foot off the ground.
[2576.89s -> 2599.90s]  Okay. Wait, but then what the hell is this for? Mountable shower idiom. What? Why is this doing
[2599.90s -> 2625.02s]  this? Rotate. I can't. Why does it snap back to there? Okay. That didn't do anything. I tried it.
[2625.02s -> 2633.11s]  I'm losing money. All right. I'm done. I'm going to leave. I gotta go. That was fun to make the
[2633.11s -> 2647.82s]  sauna. Cool. Nice. Uh, goodbye. Wait, photographing? Wait, it's doing before and after photos.
[2651.82s -> 2664.20s]  Oh, wow. Nothing. You didn't change shit. That's not all it is. Okay. I hired a cleaning company.
[2664.20s -> 2678.25s]  Let's take a look at your new house. A cleaning company came and picked up the wood. You've ruined
[2678.25s -> 2689.70s]  a room and left. And I made 7,300 bucks doing it. Bathing suits are not allowed in saunas.
[2690.66s -> 2698.86s]  Okay. Cool. How much money do I have? I have like $300,000. All right. All right. Getting
[2698.86s -> 2710.47s]  interesting here. We have this one or this one. Check out this one. Man's job. Okay. What about
[2710.47s -> 2718.26s]  this one? 100 year old memories. This house is over a hundred years old and the ubiquitous wood gives
[2718.26s -> 2724.94s]  it a unique appeal. It'd be great for Trevor and Lily and their kids. A family of sailors. It's
[2724.94s -> 2731.13s]  going to be haunted. The family fell in love with the house at first sight. It was not cheap, but
[2731.13s -> 2734.81s]  the budget for its renovation is limited. It should be just enough to have it refreshed and
[2734.81s -> 2740.66s]  introduce some necessary changes. I used to hire the wrong guy. Never hire an interior decorator
[2740.66s -> 2759.82s]  on Craigslist. And you're about to find out why. Make the Simpsons house. No. All right. Clean the
[2759.82s -> 2781.72s]  dirt. Oh, my favorite part. Weeds? He hates the Simpsons. Yeah. I think I probably do now. Like
[2781.72s -> 2785.48s]  when was the last time you watched it? I haven't watched it. I don't think, maybe not hate them.
[2785.48s -> 2789.94s]  I don't hate the Simpsons, but like I don't, I haven't watched an episode in like probably
[2789.94s -> 2796.79s]  15 years. I don't, I don't know why. Does he hate it? No, he doesn't watch it. I don't even think
[2796.79s -> 2805.34s]  I can name you the whole family right now if I tried. Bart, uh, Bart, Lisa, Santa's helper,
[2805.34s -> 2819.62s]  Homer, Marge, uh, and Margaret. I, I, I stick into it. I got it. This place is a mess. Let's remove
[2819.62s -> 2824.34s]  the fluorescent lights and the mirror from above the sink. We can lay elegant wall tiles and mount
[2824.34s -> 2828.90s]  a new mirror. This mirror fits and looks like a window. Let's keep it. We will just buy a few.
[2828.90s -> 2836.20s]  Yeah. I like the weird one. I like the weird while you're at the kitchen sink, stared a huge
[2836.20s -> 2850.17s]  mirror. This place is filthy. What do you mean that's wrong? What do you think Maggie is short
[2850.17s -> 2875.42s]  for? Yeah. Margaret, Maggie. How do you, do you guys not know? You don't. Hey, face. Where's all
[2875.42s -> 2888.82s]  this dirt out here? All right. What if I, okay, we got to go to hold onto this one. The next house
[2888.82s -> 2895.96s]  that's really, really full of trash and dirt and shit. I want to try to put it all in the same room.
[2895.96s -> 2903.43s]  So when they do the before and after picture, it's even worse. This one's on the outside.
[2903.43s -> 2917.40s]  Why am I trying to climb? Wait, that's not, why do you have little like escape doors? This is,
[2917.40s -> 2928.84s]  that's awful. Do these, you can't, these don't even open. This is not, doesn't go to the backyard.
[2928.84s -> 2941.64s]  What on earth? Or the front yard. Wait, that's the front yard. I'm not a fan. You don't have to pay
[2941.64s -> 2951.26s]  me. I'll change those out for you. These are French doors. No, they're not. Are these French windows?
[2951.26s -> 2970.92s]  This is the last bug. It's not, it's not on the roof. Isn't it? That's a germa door. Sure. Okay.
[2970.92s -> 2980.78s]  That's, that's fine. It could also be a elegant doggy door. Where's this thing? What do you see
[2980.78s -> 2993.13s]  this? I don't, I'm, I can't see this. Where is this? Oh, whatever. You got fucking rats in the wall
[2993.13s -> 3003.86s]  for all. It doesn't matter on the grass up top. I can't reach that far. You made me forget. I was
[3003.86s -> 3014.07s]  making mac and cheese. Um, that's, uh, what did you kind of leave it on? That just gets better
[3014.07s -> 3021.16s]  with age. All you guys talk all this shit about like, Oh, I fucking hate making mac and cheese.
[3021.16s -> 3027.24s]  Every time I make it, it's so runny. What's going on here? Wait, not waiting long enough. You're
[3027.24s -> 3038.52s]  not patient and you're trying to eat it before it's ready. You let it sit there, stir it up
[3038.52s -> 3043.16s]  and it'll absorb all the nutrients from, it'll absorb everything. It'll puff up. It'll be thick
[3043.16s -> 3053.22s]  and greasy and shit. You need to wait. You're not waiting long enough. There's mud all over the bed.
[3054.18s -> 3068.47s]  This is the, I found Santa's helper's room. This is just if a dog had his own bedroom.
[3068.47s -> 3073.51s]  All right. What do you want me to do in here? Clean dirt. 99%. Great. That's fantastic. Where is it?
[3073.51s -> 3094.92s]  I got it. Uh, nothing in here, right? It's dirt. Shit. I had something to tell you guys today.
[3096.98s -> 3102.62s]  What was it? What the hell did I have to tell you guys? I had something going on. I had something
[3102.62s -> 3109.88s]  to say. I had something. I remember like just like shaking my hands, like rubbing my hands,
[3109.88s -> 3117.03s]  going like, I can't wait to tell them this one. I don't know what it was. Damn. I guess we'll
[3117.03s -> 3133.77s]  never know. I don't, I don't like a lot of big orange bed sheets. Orange. No. What's the thing
[3133.77s -> 3145.90s]  about like colors? Orange doesn't, I don't like this. I mean, you remove the two pillows. Never
[3145.90s -> 3149.58s]  mind. I was going to say it'll be a giant creamsicle and I like those, but that's not even like,
[3150.06s -> 3161.86s]  who cares? That's not even funny. Nonsense words. Quick. Just say words. Quick. I mean,
[3161.86s -> 3173.05s]  uh, what should happen with our schools? Okay. Dark mahogany floor panel in here. Oh, thank God.
[3173.05s -> 3190.14s]  It's right here for me. It's foolproof. It's a, it's a prison jumpsuit bed. Words, words, words,
[3190.14s -> 3205.83s]  words, words. Why does everybody love? What's, what's the obsession with wood? When I see like
[3205.83s -> 3211.35s]  a nice carpet, I'm like, oh, I like that. It's soft. It stays warm. Your feet aren't cold.
[3211.35s -> 3219.93s]  Everybody, I don't know what it is. Everybody loves wood. I don't. When you step on wood,
[3219.93s -> 3226.12s]  you ever, you walk around a house that was predominantly wood. I've lived in one. It's,
[3226.12s -> 3237.11s]  it's, it's just in every room. I don't, it's like I'm playing basketball in my house. You'll step
[3237.11s -> 3244.15s]  on a piece of that, a panel somewhere and you'll hear a, like a hundred feet somewhere else in
[3244.15s -> 3258.52s]  another room. Everybody could always track where you, where you are in a wooden, like wood floors.
[3261.69s -> 3267.67s]  Like, I know exactly where the fuck you're stepping. I don't want to know that information.
[3267.67s -> 3278.52s]  I don't want to know how many times you've gone into, into the bathroom. It's easy to clean. Yeah,
[3278.52s -> 3285.00s]  but I know, but then you get, you obsess over it. It's really nice. Wood is expensive. Real wood,
[3285.00s -> 3289.40s]  wooden floors are expensive. So anytime that you drop anything or touch a piece of grease
[3289.40s -> 3295.00s]  and a small crumb lands on the floor, you grab it. You're like, fuck, lick your finger. No, no,
[3295.00s -> 3302.18s]  no, no, no, no, no. God, please. Just give me a multicolored shitty carpet that I can just dump
[3302.18s -> 3311.26s]  shit on. It doesn't even matter and just run a vacuum over it once a year. How many stains
[3311.26s -> 3315.10s]  are on that carpet? You will have, you'll never know. There could be a hundred hidden in the
[3315.10s -> 3322.41s]  fucking awesome carpeted multi fiber colored, just like in there. You can't even tell. I could
[3322.41s -> 3328.49s]  probably do a full piss onto some of these carpets and have you guys come in and examine it and be
[3328.49s -> 3334.18s]  like, wow, this is perfectly fine. By the way, every day I could probably piss on it every fucking
[3334.18s -> 3339.98s]  day for a year. And you would come in and you wouldn't, you had no idea where it was. It would
[3339.98s -> 3348.09s]  smell. No, it wouldn't. I would bring in somebody in a room. Hey, what do you, what do you think
[3348.09s -> 3351.93s]  about this room? It's like, it stinks like piss in here. What's this guy trying to get me to do?
[3353.35s -> 3360.70s]  Hey, come on in here. Can you, hey, can you see if you can find it? This? Cause that's all I smell.
[3361.34s -> 3375.21s]  Okay. Melissa light colored left corner sofa. That's a long one. Mimimo dark coffee table.
[3375.21s -> 3382.10s]  Where does it want this? Not here. Oh no, they did want a Mimimo dark coffee. Here, here we go.
[3382.10s -> 3393.74s]  I wish I had a couch like this. It's just a permanent bed. No matter what, you could just
[3393.74s -> 3407.72s]  lie on it. Where is this supposed to go? This is, this is why I haven't windows this big sucks.
[3408.28s -> 3418.07s]  I honestly, this is horrible. You ever want to clean these, these windows just never open.
[3418.07s -> 3421.83s]  You have to accept that. If you put one of these here, you put a couch next to a window like that,
[3421.83s -> 3427.27s]  this is a, you have to accept that it'll never be fucking opened once ever for any reason.
[3427.83s -> 3433.85s]  And you just hope to God that one day, like four years from now, when you open this,
[3433.85s -> 3438.97s]  like the dead bugs and rotten leaves that are in here are not enough to make you throw up out the
[3438.97s -> 3444.47s]  window. Cause then your neighbor will think you're crazy. Why did he just do that? He opened up his
[3444.47s -> 3452.09s]  window and puked. He has a bathroom. Doesn't he like just puking the bathroom? I don't, it takes
[3452.09s -> 3459.86s]  longer to open the window. Okay. Coffee table. I'm going to move this shit around. I don't like this
[3459.86s -> 3469.37s]  at all. I hate this. No TV in here. Fireplace. No, I don't like this. I hate, I hate this house.
[3469.37s -> 3473.93s]  Then you have the weird separate like fucking dungeon dining room. No, I don't like that.
[3473.93s -> 3478.63s]  I hate that. Get this wall out of here and get rid of the half of this room. Don't just remove
[3478.63s -> 3491.29s]  this different floor. No, this is what happens when your house is too big. Cause this is all
[3491.29s -> 3496.12s]  the furniture that anybody fucking needs in their whole life. So then you end up with like, if you
[3496.12s -> 3501.24s]  have like a 4,000 square foot house, it's like, okay, we have the biggest couch we could possibly
[3501.24s -> 3516.79s]  fucking find. Nice. That's all we need. Uh, I guess fill it with plants. You don't have TV right there.
[3516.79s -> 3527.16s]  That's unbelievable. All right. Place object. Right. Here it is. Told you. Yeah. Good. Put it,
[3527.16s -> 3533.35s]  put it up here. Right here. How about that? Yeah. It looks good. How many more of these do we want?
[3533.35s -> 3537.35s]  This is a big one. It's big enough for me to have to get it, get in the way and be smell and
[3537.35s -> 3554.04s]  get in and rot. Cause I don't take care of it. Unless they're fake. It's just unnecessary shit.
[3554.04s -> 3558.44s]  Does it look nice? I guess, but it's just, it's unnecessary shit.
[3558.44s -> 3573.40s]  Therma hates plants. No, I love plants. I love a garden. I love tending to tomatoes. I love growing
[3573.40s -> 3589.74s]  my own tomatoes and eating them. I love plants. Late dark, my heart. Where, where am I missing?
[3589.98s -> 3600.25s]  Oh, here. Oh, okay. Eat a tomato on stream. That's so funny how I have to prove that.
[3600.25s -> 3608.42s]  If any streamer ever says anything, they have to always prove it on stream. You know, I really
[3608.42s -> 3612.94s]  like, uh, I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken. Eat Buffalo chicken on stream. Prove it. Liar.
[3613.66s -> 3623.74s]  Okay. Uh, I like, I like, um, I like reading books. Liar. Read a whole book on stream. I,
[3623.74s -> 3628.30s]  I guarantee you haven't read a book at all this whole year. Oh, okay. I read it on stream. I guess
[3628.30s -> 3643.77s]  how would you get halogen lamps? He's like, let's get hot. Don't they prove it. Eat a book on stream
[3643.77s -> 3650.65s]  hanging long bulb. This ain't even our house. I want to, I have a lot of money to buy a house.
[3650.65s -> 3669.72s]  I don't care where it's placed. Living room. Why is it? How am I not? Oh, this is good dining
[3669.72s -> 3676.10s]  room. This is good. All right. I got to go upstairs. Wait, bedroom double bed Hermes.
[3676.10s -> 3697.94s]  What is double bed Hermes? Stove on stove on. I wish I had an electric stove. I don't like gas
[3697.94s -> 3705.50s]  stoves. I don't, you guys know me. I don't like gas. It freaks me out. Something about electricity
[3705.50s -> 3716.74s]  is so much safer to me in my brain than like gas. Think about all like the movies and TV shows and
[3716.74s -> 3724.31s]  like scariest things about gas. That shit ignites. Watch out. It's going to explode. What's the worst
[3724.31s -> 3731.00s]  thing that like electricity that like Will Ferrell like electrocuted himself in the fucking Christmas
[3731.00s -> 3737.69s]  movie. This house didn't explode. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Maybe it did. Maybe it did. Did it?
[3737.69s -> 3750.73s]  You could cause a fire. Yeah, but it's okay. It could, it could cause a fire. Sure. And then
[3750.73s -> 3756.82s]  the fire will take a little while to spread at least 50 to 60 seconds. Right? If you have like
[3756.82s -> 3763.53s]  electricity in an oven, if it starts, all right. An explosion is an instant. It explodes your house.
[3763.53s -> 3769.93s]  Fire is a fire. It starts somewhere and spreads. You have time. Gas in a house. The house explodes.
[3771.94s -> 3782.17s]  You don't have time. You, you have enough time to go, oh, you don't have enough. If there's
[3782.17s -> 3787.29s]  if there's electric, electricity fire, you can be like, all right, get the fucking get out.
[3787.29s -> 3791.85s]  Let's do something about it. Okay. Out, out, out. Okay. So let's do the get the fire extinguisher.
[3791.85s -> 3812.50s]  Like it's not just scream. You guys are fucking crazy. I just don't like gas. Gas scares me.
[3812.50s -> 3817.06s]  It's something about it. It's like lighter than air. It's like a gas. It like floats around and
[3817.06s -> 3827.46s]  it just ignited and shit. I don't like gas. It's scary to me. When I think of electricity,
[3827.46s -> 3837.08s]  I think of like, I think of like energy and, and like a light bulb. When I think of the word
[3837.08s -> 3851.35s]  gas, I think of or like, what's happening? What's happening? No, no, no, no. Fuck that.
[3851.35s -> 3864.74s]  Electricities. I'm like, I'm an electricity guy. Like if you hear that or smell gas, it's,
[3864.74s -> 3877.77s]  it's like immediately that like iPhone fucking like, which by the way, by the fuck do people
[3877.77s -> 3887.08s]  have that as an alarm? What, what, why do you wake your? Yeah. Like they're that iPhone
[3888.44s -> 3897.35s]  alert notification thing. Everybody had it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What was it called?
[3897.35s -> 3922.39s]  iPhone, iPhone alarm. Like, let's see. Yeah. This. All right. So if, if you smell gas, literally,
[3922.39s -> 3928.78s]  what goes through my head is this. It's I'm dead. I'm dead in five seconds. I'm going to die in five
[3928.78s -> 3936.73s]  seconds. Why would you wake up to that? Why would you ever want to rip your fucking head up from
[3936.73s -> 3946.20s]  bed? It's like you're supposed to wake up easily. It's slowly. Why do people use that for their alarm?
[3946.20s -> 3952.94s]  That sound only means three or four different things. Look out. There is a fucking tornado.
[3952.94s -> 3959.05s]  A bomb is going to drop on you. You are under attack or there is an immediate threat that is
[3959.05s -> 3968.31s]  around you. Why would you want to awake to an immediate threat? Like, oh, hey, like it's a spy
[3968.31s -> 3976.94s]  moving. You stepped on the red wire thing and now like machine guns are going to shoot at you.
[3976.94s -> 3985.78s]  You should be awakened to like chirping birds. Don't do this to yourself. It's got 50. I haven't
[3985.78s -> 3990.31s]  done anything. I've just been walking around and like, look, dude, look at it. Nothing. That's four
[3990.31s -> 4001.64s]  things. Idiot. We had that guy for five seconds. Somebody. Yeah. A plug boy gave 50 bucks. Thanks
[4001.64s -> 4011.77s]  plug boy for the huge absurd amount of money. Thank you. That's a lot of money. There's no
[4011.77s -> 4016.57s]  message or anything, but I, you guys know I don't read bit messages anymore, but that's still an
[4016.57s -> 4038.79s]  insane thing to do. Red spies in the base. Prove it. Wake up to birds right now. Okay. What do I
[4038.79s -> 4050.86s]  have to do? Turn on. Maybe a fuse is blonde. What else is left? Paint the color silver glacier in
[4050.86s -> 4069.45s]  the bedroom. Bedroom 11. Okay. Bedroom 11. Paint. Yes. My favorite part. Oh, it, it feels, I love
[4069.45s -> 4091.22s]  that about when it sucked it all up is the wrong bedroom. This is 11, two, right? 11. This is not
[4091.22s -> 4103.11s]  the wrong. What do you mean? How many bedrooms do they have here? Is this on the first floor?
[4103.11s -> 4111.82s]  That's what I'm talking about. You have too much stuff. Get lost in your own house. No, all you need
[4111.82s -> 4121.85s]  is a toilet, an electric stove and a bed. You don't need, don't all this, all this room. It's just room.
[4121.85s -> 4140.12s]  It's room for like the gas. Okay. Here we go. Get rid of this thing. There we are. I just thought
[4140.12s -> 4156.28s]  somebody gave $50. That was the someone gave $50 noise. It's so relaxing. I'm so glad that I
[4156.28s -> 4164.65s]  promised to play this today. Oh, you know what I mean? Got to just keep your word. That's my slogan.
[4164.65s -> 4174.07s]  Germa, keep your word. There's a huge scandal about how I've just, I've lied about everything.
[4174.63s -> 4179.40s]  My entire campaign was running on telling the truth and nothing I said was, was, was real.
[4190.94s -> 4199.30s]  Dean Dingus, you can't keep getting, he can't get away with this. Senator Elbertson, keep your word.
[4201.27s -> 4211.22s]  And then they play during the attack ad campaigns against me. They show how I opened up a guy's
[4211.22s -> 4218.76s]  house, went in, told him I was going to put a sauna in and then just left and lied and just told
[4218.76s -> 4234.39s]  him I wasn't going to do it anymore. Do people paint their closets? No. I mean, I thought they did.
[4235.19s -> 4239.35s]  Thank you, Peter. I thought it was Peter Griffin. Thank you, Peter V. Peter Gruen
[4239.91s -> 4250.47s]  for the 10 community subs, actually. Thanks to the 10 subs. Welcome all the new subs. Hey,
[4250.47s -> 4263.74s]  what's going on? New subs? Wait, what's in the safe? Forgotten safe in the closet. This must be
[4263.74s -> 4270.78s]  the forgotten safe of the captain that lived here a hundred years ago after selling the precious notes
[4270.78s -> 4276.49s]  and jewelry found inside the budget significantly increased. This allows us to plan something more
[4277.05s -> 4287.02s]  for both the kitchen and the bathroom. I'm on TV right now. I'm on TV. I'm about to go on like a
[4287.02s -> 4296.33s]  weird prank show adventure. How did you not see this? This is like, it's a giant fucking open
[4296.33s -> 4302.97s]  safe here that you don't, why would you not see this? Steal the money. I already, I just did.
[4302.97s -> 4318.04s]  I just did. Wait. Okay. Close this. Paint is done. We can sell this now. All right. We need a bedside
[4318.04s -> 4331.53s]  table. Well, can I give you some more design choices here? Cause that is an ugly ass bed.
[4331.61s -> 4344.15s]  There, there we go. Make sure you give me a good review on Yelp. German 985. It's my German 985
[4344.15s -> 4355.13s]  colors. How's it going to fit in here? This room sucks. How is it supposed to fit in here?
[4355.13s -> 4370.73s]  Why would you want a bed like this? Okay. Bedside. The bed doesn't fit. It's supposed to be an end
[4370.73s -> 4390.50s]  table. This bed only can fit one way and it blocks every door. And we need a lamp. Make sure you get
[4390.50s -> 4413.21s]  those German 985 colors. What's this? A carpet? Get that German 985 set green. All right. The
[4413.21s -> 4419.48s]  carpet is there for all the shit that goes under your bed. It's a useless carpet and they want a
[4419.48s -> 4431.35s]  painting, a big one. Okay. Does anybody feel like, okay, if this was next to your bed and you were
[4431.35s -> 4437.16s]  sleeping and you're snoring your life away, you know, you're just sleeping and you turn when you
[4437.16s -> 4441.99s]  wake up and your eyes, you're pointing this way and you see this. I feel like sometimes I would
[4441.99s -> 4454.97s]  actually think I was sleeping on a beach for a second. It would be terrifying. Okay. This one's
[4454.97s -> 4473.19s]  done. What's next? Oh, a choice. A cupboard shelf and new tiles will be enough. We will utilize the
[4473.19s -> 4483.53s]  extra budget. Let's go crazy and add a second sink. I want to save the money that I stole.
[4483.53s -> 4496.07s]  I'm going to invest that shit. Okay. Modify the walls, wall tiles. Oh yeah. That's right. You have
[4496.07s -> 4509.90s]  to actually pick these up. You can have finished. Okay. I can finish the job now. Do we care? I
[4509.90s -> 4521.86s]  don't think we care. No, this is just to make money so I can buy my own house. It's coming up
[4521.86s -> 4555.35s]  here in a minute. Yeah, I'm done. Wait, first I want to fuck their whole shit up. Hold on. I'm
[4555.35s -> 4568.41s]  going to put the dining room table in here too. Turn the oven on. No, I'm going to put the, I'll
[4568.41s -> 4574.90s]  put the oven in there. That much better in there. When you're watching the game, you're going to have
[4574.90s -> 4601.90s]  a nice fucking crisp pizza ready. Okay. I can think about what I want. Okay. Done. I've prepared
[4601.90s -> 4610.01s]  you for your yard sale. Complete the job. You may not complete the job, but I got tons of money. I
[4610.01s -> 4622.94s]  don't care about the money. I just care about making a statement. Yeah. All you did was remove
[4622.94s -> 4641.16s]  my things. Here's the, you know, the best part about that was this is how all this bullshit,
[4641.16s -> 4649.13s]  all the fake like filters and stuff. That was just a filter on the shitty picture. They took
[4649.13s -> 4652.73s]  a shitty picture and they put a little filter on it to make it look better. It doesn't look like
[4652.73s -> 4660.54s]  that. I didn't walk in that room. They tried so hard to make how bad that was look. Not as bad,
[4660.54s -> 4679.46s]  even though it's just the raw photo. I got $341,000. I'm ready. We need a big one. Um,
[4679.46s -> 4696.12s]  there's an actual Simpson's house in the game. How do I do that one? I don't know if you can
[4696.12s -> 4703.16s]  buy the house in the HDTV part. Oh, all right. Property renovation in the rental business. She's
[4703.16s -> 4707.86s]  expecting a baby. So there's no way she can work as much as usually. I'm going to have to help her
[4707.86s -> 4711.62s]  with a house for one of her clients. The semi-detached house that requires some work and
[4711.62s -> 4720.63s]  yeah. Okay. I got a $9,000 budget. You're in story mode. Yeah. I got to unlock all the tools and then
[4720.63s -> 4728.54s]  I'm going to take those tools into, into free purchase mode. All right. So what does she want?
[4728.54s -> 4734.84s]  First of all, this has got to change. That's the first, uh, you want, you really need a,
[4734.84s -> 4738.92s]  an HDTV specialist to tell you that this is probably not something that this is probably
[4738.92s -> 4745.48s]  like a, you want like a more neutral color. Well, now we've got a clean slate to work with.
[4745.48s -> 4753.83s]  All right. Here's an idea. Maybe we should demolish the two walls and knock it down.
[4753.83s -> 4758.26s]  Knock it down. Knock the whole thing down. The whole thing should be an open floor plan,
[4758.26s -> 4769.78s]  including the bathrooms. Knock it down. I'm talking square build tool in the Sims.
[4770.90s -> 4789.05s]  No rooms made. This is just as satisfying as it was before. All right. Well,
[4789.05s -> 4806.97s]  I have the sledgehammer feels good. Feels good. It's been a while. It's excessively loud. Yep.
[4806.97s -> 4815.51s]  The game is excessively loud. Someone has started working on the kitchen already gone with a dark
[4815.51s -> 4821.86s]  brown paint. Let's add some traditional hanging lamps. No, I hate those. Let's put some bright
[4821.86s -> 4842.49s]  colors on the walls. Yes, absolutely. Lime green. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean? Well,
[4842.49s -> 4854.42s]  what are you doing? I'm doing my interior designing. What are you doing? Besides
[4854.42s -> 4868.58s]  criticizing a genius at work. Broken pipe. It looks like the radiator. I wait. Yes. No,
[4868.58s -> 4872.10s]  it's water. Okay. The leak needs to be stopped. There should be a water supply valve.
[4878.26s -> 4900.28s]  This is the urgent water, water supply valve. I'm going to hit the gas line. Okay. I'm actually
[4900.28s -> 4905.56s]  kind of concerned about this because if I hit a gas line and it's an instant gas line explosion,
[4906.20s -> 4910.04s]  then I'm starting to have a little bit of a scenario here. I don't like this.
[4910.68s -> 4934.95s]  If I can hit the water line, then I can hit the gas line. This is the load bearing wall.
[4938.20s -> 4948.17s]  Yeah. Where's the load bearing wall? There ain't no more walls. The house is just laid on top
[4948.17s -> 4963.50s]  like a hat. Oh no, the house is coming down. Just delete everything. I'm going to make an open floor.
[4963.50s -> 4980.47s]  I'm going to make a completely open Sims 4 renovation. This guy's deranged. Just renovate
[4980.47s -> 4985.35s]  it as an empty field. Just take the whole house down. So the before and after is just a house and
[4985.35s -> 5001.70s]  then the house is gone. That's not a renovation. That's a magic trick. Imagine going through all
[5001.70s -> 5008.25s]  that trouble. What we're going to do is we're going to bulldoze their fucking house and then I'm going
[5008.25s -> 5014.46s]  to pretend on TV that I made it disappear and I'm just going to cut these people. You know what?
[5015.50s -> 5021.08s]  I wonder how many times maybe that has happened before. If I was just a millionaire
[5021.64s -> 5027.72s]  magician, I would just like, here's a check. How much is your house worth?
[5028.79s -> 5035.50s]  Oh, the house is worth probably 325,000. I'll give you 400,000 if you let me do a magic trick
[5035.50s -> 5055.50s]  where I disappear your house. You just go buy one in cash. But I need to do this. You mean destroy
[5055.50s -> 5061.26s]  it? Yeah. But, but, but it's a magic trick. It's not, I'm not like destroying the house.
[5061.26s -> 5074.62s]  It's a magic trick. I even use the door. Is it leak? That's fine. Not my problem.
[5077.24s -> 5104.18s]  All right. Load bearing wall. Don't touch that one. Can't get rid of this one. It's got an
[5104.18s -> 5114.50s]  achievement for being an asshole. The achievement I just got is called truly open space. See,
[5116.73s -> 5124.94s]  I'm making game progress. What is this? This is like a puppeteer station. There's a wall here,
[5124.94s -> 5131.51s]  wall there. This is where the family crouches down and has like puppet night. How can I sell
[5131.51s -> 5143.96s]  this? Yeah, I'm sorry. If you have a dedicated puppetry room, then I guarantee you, you got five
[5143.96s -> 5149.18s]  or six big plants in your house. You want to put, you want to make that bet? You want to put that
[5149.18s -> 5169.24s]  money down? What are these? Cement. I thought I said gourmet. Gourmet cement. Lights on floor,
[5169.24s -> 5184.55s]  lights on floor. It's all right. I'm not going to, that's immoral. I can't sell the doors. The doors
[5184.55s -> 5195.66s]  have to stay, but everything else can be smashed down with a sledgehammer. That's very immoral.
[5198.71s -> 5213.43s]  Okay. That's it, right? Any more? Move furniture into the water leak. See, hey, if being a psycho
[5213.43s -> 5229.03s]  was a strategy game, we would get an S plus on every level. You get that, right? Okay. Is this
[5229.03s -> 5244.66s]  the house? Is there any more rooms or anything? Who's we? What do you mean? I'm talking about you.
[5245.88s -> 5252.58s]  It's you that I'm referring to. Talking about you. All right, cool. Now we want build the walls.
[5254.66s -> 5270.89s]  A mountable towel radiator. Toilet? All right. Oh, should I need to mount this toilet?
[5272.60s -> 5281.82s]  I can't just jam it in there. Just stick it into the water. Wait, lay wall. Wait, wait, wait. What
[5281.82s -> 5287.90s]  room am I in? I need a radiator. Towel radiator plumbing system. Right, right, right, right, right.
[5287.90s -> 5310.84s]  What is a towel radiator plumbing system? What? Did I read that wrong? No, I want to get that out
[5310.84s -> 5323.37s]  of the way. Wait, what is this here for? A towel warmer. You don't even need a shower. Just come
[5323.37s -> 5330.20s]  into the leaking room and just smush your face over here. It's an indoor pool. Yeah. Somebody gets it.
[5330.20s -> 5354.20s]  Okay. Remove object. No. Where's the toilet mount? Move the bathtub onto the leak. Can I move the
[5354.20s -> 5361.16s]  bathtub? I can't. I cannot move the bathtub, unfortunately. Click on the link. What even is
[5361.16s -> 5371.40s]  the toilet really? Wow. This is your room. It's so cool. Yeah. Yep. Why do you always have to use
[5371.40s -> 5379.69s]  this drunk image? I don't know where these are supposed to go. All right. Mountable. Mountable
[5379.69s -> 5401.45s]  towel radiator. What is this? Old Japanese sink. Okay. There we go. Yeah. I fixed one of the leaks.
[5401.45s -> 5422.47s]  Where does it go? That's crazy that that's how they make these things. Okay. Cool. What's wrong
[5422.47s -> 5440.47s]  with this? Assemble. It is assembled. Paint with the colors young flower bud. Uh, young flower bud.
[5440.47s -> 5450.02s]  All right. Here we go. This is going to be real boring, but I love it. Enable A. Yay. Yay. A. I'm
[5450.02s -> 5466.90s]  not going to say it the way it's supposed to be said. It's baby puke yellow. I think this is baby
[5466.90s -> 5472.14s]  puke baby. This is, I think this is, yeah, this is baby, like baby burp yellow. That's a better way
[5472.14s -> 5488.04s]  to put it. Why would you? Yeah. Yellow. I mean, it's, I don't know, like an olive. What would you
[5488.04s -> 5499.22s]  call it? This is carpet piss. Yeah. That's accurate. That is what it looks. That's an accurate
[5499.22s -> 5509.64s]  carpet piss color. You're right. Oh, rude. That would be if you told somebody that. Yeah. We had
[5509.64s -> 5515.37s]  the, we had it painted. We, uh, yeah, we got a painter in here to the bedrooms, did the living
[5515.37s -> 5522.66s]  room. This looks like carpet piss yellow. Because if you, when you hear that, you have to really
[5522.66s -> 5527.40s]  think about it because it doesn't make any sense at first. And then you think about what an old
[5527.40s -> 5538.79s]  piss would look like as a big gross circle. And then you would see it and you would know. And then
[5538.79s -> 5555.72s]  you get angry. It angers you. Then you pretend to like it. And then eventually you pretend to like
[5555.72s -> 5562.66s]  it for so long that you're just like, yeah, it's cool. I like it. It's fine. You know what I really
[5562.66s -> 5571.32s]  do miss though? Oh, I missed my spearmint green gamer room. I love that color. I might, I got it.
[5571.32s -> 5578.55s]  I want, I want like a spearmint green room again. Oh, I love it so much. It's like my favorite color.
[5578.55s -> 5595.05s]  Okay. So now we need, uh, lay wall tiles and white mosaic hexagon. Wait, it's just right here. What?
[5595.05s -> 5610.38s]  Hexagon. What's it called? White mosaic hexagon. Right. I was supposed to go. Oh yeah. That's right.
[5610.38s -> 5617.66s]  This is, this is a room. Olive greens. My favorite color. Wait, this is not right. The room is just
[5617.66s -> 5641.27s]  going. Just testing each room. Which, which room is it going? Wall tiles. Shit. Hold on. Modify what?
[5642.90s -> 5661.74s]  Dark gray mosaic? No, I thought it was white mosaic. Shit. No, that's not right either.
[5661.74s -> 5679.94s]  I could draw a penis. Modify walls. What? Here we go. Why is that not working? Eight out of 10.
[5681.32s -> 5696.23s]  Put this away. Throw this away. I don't want this. I have to get rid of them. It's because
[5696.23s -> 5706.97s]  I demolished all the walls. I actually kind of like that. It gives off the like in the pool.
[5706.97s -> 5716.76s]  That's like the side of a pool. I really like that. Okay. Let's go. White tiles. 25 of them. Good.
[5717.32s -> 5732.54s]  This is a bathroom house. That's a good idea. God damn it. Am I going to get like addicted
[5732.54s -> 5737.45s]  to house slipper again? I think I might. I don't know. Are we, are we going to be streaming this
[5737.45s -> 5744.41s]  tomorrow? Oh no. What have you done? Why did you remind me that I promised to play this?
[5744.89s -> 5766.02s]  You know what happens? I get stuck here. That's enough, right? Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. He said that
[5766.02s -> 5775.62s]  that's the best streams. I love this game. This game is so simple and it's so basic,
[5777.10s -> 5785.88s]  but it's like the best game and real. I love this game. This has to be my favorite game
[5786.44s -> 5793.27s]  in the last five years. Isn't that fucked up? That sounds like it's something you shouldn't say out
[5793.27s -> 5807.58s]  loud. What's come out in the last five years? I got to paint some, wait, I'm going to paint this
[5807.58s -> 5817.99s]  wall in here. Lay tiles, wallpaper with bamboo. All right. Hold on. Paint. Okay. Young flower bud
[5817.99s -> 5827.08s]  needs a little bit more space. What about a half-life game? But that's like, what do you mean
[5827.08s -> 5839.96s]  the last five years? Half-life Alex? I haven't played half-life Alex though. So how can I compare
[5839.96s -> 5860.33s]  it? This doesn't count as a wall. Okay. There we go. 73, 24, 75, 76, 77. Play half-life Alex. I'm
[5860.33s -> 5863.69s]  going to, don't worry. I'm going to go back to VR. I'm going to go back to VR. It's going to be a
[5863.69s -> 5871.62s]  big VR day, big VR week. I'm going to play all that shit. You're going to trust me. All right.
[5871.62s -> 5877.80s]  Wall tiles in the bathroom. Or should I do light? Okay. Light biscuits going to be in here.
[5877.80s -> 5898.22s]  Just do that now. Ooh, I like that. You're pogged. Look at that. What? You're pogged?
[5898.22s -> 5912.04s]  Why is that clippable? Clippable. He always keeps his word. I try to. Thank you. I really
[5912.04s -> 5922.97s]  appreciate that you coming in saying that. Real voice. Yeah. This is like kind of great.
[5922.97s -> 5927.53s]  If you called me at like six o'clock in the afternoon and I answered the phone, I'd be like,
[5927.53s -> 5936.54s]  what's up? Be like this. Hey, what's going on? What are you doing? Nah, nothing. Sorry. I might
[5936.54s -> 5942.46s]  sound a little hoarse. I was acting on Twitch for a while. Yeah. You play Mario Maker 2 yet, dude?
[5943.16s -> 5949.43s]  Yeah, that's fucking suck. It's a wicked good acting game. Yeah. Come over. You can come over
[5949.43s -> 5956.98s]  like an hour. Fucking tired from, you know, missing a jump over and over again. But it
[5956.98s -> 5975.11s]  fucking kills on Twitch, man. Dark gray mosaic. Where are these going to go? Is he from Boston?
[5976.38s -> 5984.54s]  Yeah. That's kind of where I fucking grew up, dude. I live. I live in Vegas now, but I was a
[5984.54s -> 5992.50s]  fucking big Boston guy before I moved here. And you know what? It's still with me every day.
[5992.50s -> 6023.03s]  This is just the drug chair. Oh, hey guys. Okay. I think I'm good. Stare at the wall. Okay.
[6046.26s -> 6055.32s]  Open the window. It stinks in here. What am I doing? I still have $8,000 of a budget. I'm
[6055.32s -> 6061.96s]  going to put an expensive chair in here. There's a garage too. All right. What's this a bed?
[6061.96s -> 6093.91s]  Let's make it an invisible bed. I can't. I'm not going to be able to fit it. It can't go in like
[6093.91s -> 6109.64s]  that. What are you a lizard? Yeah. Well, you know, I am a fucking lizard. So I have to have
[6110.44s -> 6115.93s]  moisture in the bedroom at all times. My wife, you still have to spray me with a bottle.
[6116.95s -> 6125.80s]  This is a much better solution. I think. All right. Would you let me ask you again,
[6125.80s -> 6130.60s]  would you be able to do that? Would you be able to sleep like this? That's a challenge. I'm not
[6130.60s -> 6141.37s]  sure I would be able to. If you were wicked tired and the water wasn't cold, it was exactly at like
[6141.37s -> 6146.33s]  68 degrees. It was like 70 degree water, completely isotonic. It had enough sodium.
[6147.32s -> 6152.60s]  It's an isotonic solution. Would you be able to sleep with that if that was not pointed at your
[6152.60s -> 6158.60s]  face? And there was like a doctor and a scientist and like a construction worker that were ready
[6158.60s -> 6164.92s]  to like, Hey, like we got to get them out of there. Do you think you'd be able to fall asleep?
[6166.49s -> 6170.73s]  No, no, not hypothermia. That is, this is an isotonic solution. It has like the right amount
[6170.73s -> 6187.72s]  of sodium, nitrogen, hydrogen, everything, human blood. It's isotonic. Look it up. Okay. That's
[6187.72s -> 6198.70s]  good. Am I getting money points for this? Let me check. Look down there. Progress. I'm not,
[6198.70s -> 6206.74s]  I'm not getting any progress. Okay. Lay wall tiles, wallpaper with bamboo. Where is that going to go?
[6206.74s -> 6223.03s]  Dark gray hexagon. I must have burped really loud. Dark gray hexagon mosaic. Do you mean credit
[6223.03s -> 6241.03s]  score? Wait, what did I say? I don't remember. This is not even right. It's free credit report.com.
[6241.03s -> 6246.86s]  I'm lying down here seeing all this in this restaurant. They monitor your credit and give
[6246.86s -> 6258.23s]  you free email alerts and put it on your sweatshirt and you see the t-shirts. Shit. Now you all heard
[6258.23s -> 6267.38s]  it. It worked like 20, like 15 years later. It's still worked. Congratulations. It's still fucking
[6267.38s -> 6273.22s]  worked. Good work. Ad campaign team. You deserve, all of you deserve to get at least a 20, 30 percent
[6273.22s -> 6281.83s]  raise. All of you, wherever you are now. I don't care where you are. And that band. I hope they,
[6281.83s -> 6285.75s]  I hope they're absolutely killing it. I hope the last EP they dropped has like fucking 500 million
[6285.75s -> 6302.02s]  plays on Spotify. I really hope that. All right. Now paint with the natural beige. The band broke
[6302.02s -> 6310.97s]  up after the commercials. Oh, that's really sad. That makes me feel bad. Really? No. Did they?
[6311.29s -> 6330.54s]  Okay. All I just read was all the, like everyone's talking about this band and then somebody just
[6330.54s -> 6350.25s]  wrote, this is a fucking mess. Holy shit. No, I'm not. Okay. Paint with the natural base. Six percent.
[6350.25s -> 6358.30s]  What do you mean six percent? There's not enough walls in this house to do this. Wait, is there
[6358.30s -> 6376.52s]  another house? Oh Jesus Christ. This is second house. Wait, no. What? House two? No, there's not
[6376.52s -> 6383.58s]  enough walls. There are not enough walls in this house. Is there a house three?
[6388.02s -> 6399.82s]  Jerma, you're a fucking idiot. You broke the walls. Right. You're right. Okay. Well, why can't I just?
[6399.82s -> 6410.87s]  Okay. I have a solution. We need to build five walls. More than that. Where's the build tool?
[6410.87s -> 6427.21s]  Okay. We need just enough room to be able to paint on all sides. That's four. This is four, eight,
[6427.21s -> 6437.98s]  12, 16, 20. Okay. Build a maze. That's another one I could do. I could build a maze. I'm gonna build
[6437.98s -> 6444.38s]  a maze in one of the, all right. Welcome to fucking house flipper week. I'm sorry. I think maybe at
[6444.38s -> 6451.88s]  least a thousand people just put their hands in the air when, god damn it. Okay. So what do I need?
[6451.88s -> 6468.55s]  Beige. Do beige first. Natural beige. Five percent. Six percent. These ones have to be beige. All right.
[6468.55s -> 6481.98s]  Where's the beige? Pipers. God damn it. Yeah. If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve
[6481.98s -> 6500.25s]  my cat puke noise. Come on, guys. 12 percent. Is this? I can't tell this is working. Is my grand
[6500.25s -> 6526.02s]  scheme actually working? I think so. Because this is technically 14 percent. Yeah, it is working.
[6526.02s -> 6540.86s]  Carpet piss omega lull house. This is gonna be such a pain in the ass. This is gonna be such a
[6540.94s -> 6550.25s]  pain in the ass. Get rid of this chair. Get rid of this stuff. I need, okay. 18 percent. Shit.
[6552.44s -> 6574.30s]  I have to build so many more walls that are separated. Build them all together? Will that
[6574.30s -> 6586.52s]  be more space? But like, we can do that. Yep. We can do, we can, all right. We can do like a McRib
[6586.52s -> 6609.21s]  system. That works. Yeah, it works. That'll be way more surface to paint. Nuclear reactor house.
[6609.21s -> 6628.30s]  It's very funny. Like, large generator. Build them outside. Did they add that in house flipper?
[6628.86s -> 6637.18s]  I remember you couldn't do that before. Do it outside. Wait, can you build outside? Can you?
[6637.82s -> 6648.52s]  How the fuck is this still 15 percent? This is beige, right? Light biscuit? No, this is wrong.
[6650.62s -> 6661.77s]  Natural beige. That's not it either. Oh, god damn it. Buy another one. Buy like three of them.
[6663.19s -> 6674.20s]  That's, that's light biscuit. Okay, there we go. Now we're going, now we're cooking with gas.
[6674.20s -> 6704.49s]  Not scary! Is that loud? Is that really loud? I'm sorry if it was. No? All right, I'm sorry if it was.
[6704.49s -> 6713.37s]  Sorry. Okay, 25 percent. Can I build this shit outside? I don't think I can, guys. Wait,
[6715.70s -> 6724.98s]  does this not count? No, no build tool. I can't. Remember, you're so loud. Everyone always yells at
[6724.98s -> 6731.11s]  me because they say I'm too quiet and now everyone says I'm loud. Okay, we're gonna need some more
[6731.11s -> 6740.06s]  walls. What are we at? 20 what percent? Late wall tiles. Okay, wait, wallpaper with bamboo. Let's do
[6740.06s -> 6758.79s]  that because I know I can do that like over here. I don't need very much of this. One guy. Get rid
[6758.79s -> 6775.88s]  of this. I don't want this. There we are. Okay, how many do I need? 11. Something's in my eye.
[6775.88s -> 6793.86s]  Something's in my eye. Something's in my eye. All right, we're good. Four, five, six, seven,
[6795.58s -> 6808.23s]  eight. Am I trying to make it look like my house is a plant? Nine. Look, these are my roots. Like,
[6808.23s -> 6830.62s]  I have roots going down. N and 11. White mosaic hexagon. Oh, whoops. Not it. How much budget do
[6830.62s -> 6837.22s]  I have? I stole a lot of money from somebody, right? I want to put this shit down. I don't
[6837.22s -> 6854.31s]  want to hold this anymore. Going on the outside. Okay, where am I missing this? Where's the white?
[6854.39s -> 6869.64s]  Okay, I see. Build one of these. Beige. Mountable towel radiator. Well, that's that right there.
[6869.64s -> 6879.75s]  All right, sell this shit. Get this out of here. So, I need to build the walls. Didn't I already
[6879.75s -> 6899.16s]  build five walls? Shower bed. You need... All right, who made the dumb joke that got him started on
[6899.16s -> 6905.74s]  this awful house? I don't think anybody did. Nobody did. This wasn't some kind of joke or,
[6905.74s -> 6923.16s]  well, let's do this. No, I don't think so, at least. That's all I had to do. Why is that in here?
[6926.26s -> 6934.31s]  Isn't that kind of a weird place to have that? Okay, sink. Turn it back on. I can't turn it back
[6934.31s -> 6952.31s]  on. Turn it... I don't... I didn't know what it did. It was just a random valve. Quick, break it again.
[6952.31s -> 6971.46s]  That's not going to work. Wait, it might. Hold on. No, it's gone. Let it go. All right, let's finish
[6971.46s -> 6984.39s]  this. How I still not made this much progress? The garage. Okay, it's the trash in the garage
[6984.39s -> 7019.10s]  that's killing me. All right, now... That's it. Garage is clean. Decorations. This guy's got like
[7019.10s -> 7033.53s]  a Rube Goldberg machine in his house. Whenever he turns on the garage, it's like... It's like an egg
[7033.53s -> 7056.68s]  that just drops and scrolls around the gears. Wait, they're just big ones? Damn it. I can
[7056.68s -> 7065.67s]  make a gear house. Shit. Okay, remind me of that later. Remind me of that later. Not now. I'll do
[7065.67s -> 7087.18s]  it later. No, we need like a couch in here. Furniture. Table. Minecraft jumping event. Bunk beds.
[7087.18s -> 7092.90s]  They added bunk beds. They added bunk beds. This is the greatest day ever. They added bunk beds.
[7092.90s -> 7128.46s]  What's my WCW? Like wrestling? WCW. What do you want to click on? Women Crush Wednesday. LOL,
[7128.46s -> 7146.60s]  I choose Ursula. The top reply here is, oh god, you're drunk again. And then I replied saying,
[7146.60s -> 7160.14s]  haha, I'm not. I just have this super WCW on Ursula. Why did I do this? What's wrong with you?
[7160.14s -> 7176.20s]  Good crush. Okay, so why are you linking this to me? I got a tweet I made like four years ago.
[7182.33s -> 7187.85s]  I don't... I don't... Hey, Jeremy, maybe you said this like on Twitter five years ago.
[7187.93s -> 7199.24s]  Remember this video, this specific moment that happened in video 225 in 2012? I don't even
[7199.24s -> 7206.46s]  remember what I had for lunch yesterday. I don't even know. I have... I don't remember what it was.
[7206.46s -> 7214.65s]  I don't know these things that I say. That's a humble brag. Forgetting what you ate for lunch
[7214.65s -> 7227.59s]  yesterday is concerning. That's not a humble brag. It's Wednesday. Is it still Ursula?
[7228.31s -> 7236.92s]  All right, let me just focus on my HD... HDTV. I need to wait. What do I have to do? Okay,
[7236.92s -> 7246.33s]  this is broken. This. I gotta mount a sink here. What kind of sink do they want? Build the walls.
[7246.33s -> 7266.50s]  I have to build these walls, right? I don't know what the fuck they want. ADHDGTV. What is ADHDGTV?
[7266.50s -> 7272.92s]  Is that like the guy renovates a house but he cannot decide on the color of the couch he wants
[7272.92s -> 7283.85s]  so he keeps getting it upholstered for the whole episode and that's it. This is a guy paints like
[7283.85s -> 7294.84s]  half of the house and then just kind of starts watching TV. Basically, it's this stream. No,
[7294.84s -> 7305.02s]  it's not. This is not what I would do if I was on HGTV. Walls. What do they want these walls?
[7306.10s -> 7325.62s]  Build wall. Modify the room's layout. Isn't that what I'm doing? It's the green on the map.
[7326.26s -> 7345.45s]  Oh, it won't. Right. Okay. Wait, that's not even it. What the fuck is that for? You just built an
[7345.45s -> 7364.22s]  annoying wall? It's a wall. Yeah, I know what it is but why is it? It sticks out too far. Okay,
[7364.22s -> 7382.82s]  we need young flower bud or a booger beige. I'm gonna go with booger beige. Place little walls
[7382.90s -> 7392.71s]  on the ceiling. Paint with beige. How much of their room do they house? They want beige.
[7392.71s -> 7400.38s]  You guys thought I was boring. 75 out of 80 with the other one. Where's the green one?
[7400.38s -> 7429.93s]  What's it called? This one. Just complete the ones that can be completed. Okay. Wall with bamboo.
[7432.74s -> 7459.93s]  Alright. Closing one door, opening two more. There it is. That made no sense. Yeah, it did.
[7459.93s -> 7472.60s]  How do I drop shit? Press E to pick up the $60. Here we go. Alright, look. I'm gonna fix this.
[7472.60s -> 7491.51s]  Check it out. Alright. Lay floor tiles. Floor panel pine. You got it? Floor panel pine. Alright.
[7491.51s -> 7504.74s]  About right here. 2%. I think the entire house is supposed to be like this. How would you have room
[7504.74s -> 7523.22s]  for anything else? It's only 27%. 32%? Is the bathroom pine wood? This is the worst house I've
[7523.22s -> 7529.29s]  made. I didn't make this house. Remember, gotta get it right here. I didn't make this house. I'm
[7529.29s -> 7535.24s]  just getting money to be able to do my own house. This is me renovating somebody else's. And yes,
[7535.24s -> 7550.39s]  I took the money up front. This is horrible. Regardless of how much I fucked this whole thing
[7550.39s -> 7555.69s]  up, that doesn't matter. This whole house is a wood floor. The entire thing, the same color,
[7555.69s -> 7578.98s]  everything. Even in the bathroom? Only 50% so far. How? Do you want me to put wood floor on the roof?
[7578.98s -> 7596.98s]  66%. This is so stupid. 80%. It's because I made everything one room. So I'm never gonna be able
[7596.98s -> 7609.30s]  to complete all the tasks. Please. What do you want? What? What is it? Guys, you're not gonna
[7609.30s -> 7618.87s]  believe this. Hey, woozledoo is in my bedroom. I wish I was in your bedroom. Yeah, what? What do
[7618.87s -> 7640.39s]  you want me to say? Wrong link. Wait, is this the go-through Jerma's Twitter comedy hour?
[7640.47s -> 7651.24s]  Let's go, let's go to like 2012 and find some comedy. All right, that's it. That's Team YouTube
[7651.24s -> 7657.32s]  Money's new album cover. Here's the story of that. That Team YouTube Money was the name. I didn't
[7657.32s -> 7664.46s]  pick the name. The name was already there. We got called in from the benches because, uh, I believe
[7664.46s -> 7668.94s]  if I get the story right, I want to get the story right. I think the incredible orb legally couldn't
[7668.94s -> 7677.40s]  participate in the United States in that shoot mania tournament. So we had, we were like the
[7677.40s -> 7684.39s]  bench players that came in. If I remember that correctly, like it was supposed to be like orb
[7684.39s -> 7690.97s]  was in like the tournament or something. Then we were like, at least I was like the B team. It was,
[7690.97s -> 7701.16s]  I was the, I was the anchor. You guys don't remember that? That's okay. A long time ago,
[7701.16s -> 7706.28s]  like 10 years, eight years ago or so now, seven years ago, I played in a shoot mania storm
[7706.28s -> 7716.41s]  tournament and we almost won the whole thing. It was streamed. This was streamed like seven and a
[7716.41s -> 7724.07s]  half years ago. And what it really came down to was MLC stealth just carried us all the way to
[7724.07s -> 7730.38s]  the final fucking round. Star was pretty good too. It was me star and MLC stealth, but it was supposed
[7730.38s -> 7734.94s]  to be, I think me, no, it was supposed to be star like MLC stealth and orb, but like he couldn't,
[7734.94s -> 7740.49s]  they like legally wasn't allowed to participate because he wasn't a US citizen or something.
[7740.49s -> 7754.54s]  Here's a video of it. Yeah, it was a big deal. I was an actual, yeah, a gaming warlord. Yeah,
[7754.54s -> 7760.86s]  gaming anchor. Eric, you gotta have an anchor on the boat. MLC stealth was like the sails.
[7762.18s -> 7770.22s]  Star was like the solid wood and I was the anchor and be careful. You want to go on a fucking trip
[7770.22s -> 7775.35s]  without an anchor with a boat. What if a storm comes? What if you need to drop that anchor hard
[7775.35s -> 7793.11s]  into the ground? I'm here. I'm here to, I'm ready. The train needs a caboose. Please just make the
[7793.11s -> 7808.30s]  house less bad. Actual literal dead weight. All right, let me finish this. Let me finish this,
[7808.30s -> 7819.80s]  please. This looks like the house from Hellraiser. No, no. All right. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[7819.80s -> 7825.46s]  I need to, let me finish this first. I don't even, you know, I'm laughing at that, but I don't even
[7825.46s -> 7829.70s]  know what they're talking about. I haven't seen the movie in so long. I just hear the word Hellraiser
[7829.70s -> 7832.98s]  and I think of the guy with like the needles in his face and I'm just like, holy shit, this probably
[7832.98s -> 7839.70s]  looked horrible then. And then that cube that bites you, right? And it needs to like you drink
[7839.70s -> 7850.63s]  your blood and then go take a portal. I don't even remember that movie. What's next? Mountable toilet
[7850.63s -> 7861.90s]  fire fairy. Okay, I need mountable toilet furry. A toilet fairy. I don't think I want to know
[7861.90s -> 7880.57s]  about that. What is it? Toilet fairy? Mountable toilet fairy. Nice. Okay, too bad we couldn't
[7880.57s -> 7885.45s]  like lift this up another water go in there. That's just a complete and total. Oh, okay.
[7886.09s -> 7901.32s]  Old fashioned sink. Where's it supposed to even go? Is it actually supposed to go right here?
[7901.88s -> 7926.31s]  Oh, I don't think I can even assemble this. Here comes the toilet fairy. What would that even be?
[7926.31s -> 7935.13s]  Like you have the tooth fairy. The tooth fairy, if you lose a tooth. Hey, the tooth fairy left a
[7935.13s -> 7942.58s]  dollar under your pillow. Does the toilet fairy leave a dollar in the toilet after like you took
[7942.58s -> 7954.55s]  a dump in it? How come I can't close this thing out? Am I doing this wrong? Why? How come I can't
[7954.55s -> 7965.90s]  do this? I'm sorry, that was weird. Okay, short narrow curtain. I'm assuming for the bathtub
[7965.90s -> 7994.70s]  thing here. Short narrow curtain. Multiple, mountable wide curtain. That's not for the bathtub.
[7994.70s -> 8009.26s]  Mountable wide curtain. What is this? Oh, it goes up here. There's not enough room to place it. How?
[8014.17s -> 8026.28s]  Oh, come on. All right. We're almost it doesn't matter. Place object. What does it want me to
[8026.28s -> 8038.95s]  place tasks? Nothing in the garage, right? Okay, I have to place these objects. We're almost there.
[8038.95s -> 8047.66s]  Get it. All right. We're there. We're there. We're there. We're there. Okay. We're done. Done. Done.
[8047.66s -> 8059.66s]  Done. Done. Done. Done. I can do it. Let's go. The job is complete. Let's see the before and after.
[8061.27s -> 8088.12s]  The garage looks nice. It doesn't look that bad. Oh, mega lol. The bucket. The bucket of paint. Yeah.
[8088.12s -> 8092.47s]  Jerma, Jerma, stop wasting channel points. They're going to be so valuable.
[8093.03s -> 8101.83s]  Eventually, that's what my excuse lead to the Simpsons house. Let me see if there's any new
[8101.83s -> 8117.34s]  houses to buy. I got 350 grand mail. No, I'm not doing this. Wait, look for like Bart Simpson
[8117.34s -> 8128.97s]  or something, right? Do I have an email from Bart Simpson? No. Damn it. Like writing a letter to
[8128.97s -> 8135.93s]  Santa Claus and expecting him to write back. I sent Rocco from Rocco's Modern Life a thank you
[8135.93s -> 8149.70s]  letter. I liked his show, but he didn't write me back. All right. The game's going to really open
[8149.70s -> 8163.56s]  up here when I'm done with tutorial house four. We're going to do this quick. That's until he was
[8163.56s -> 8168.46s]  released. Yeah. All right. Ed purchased the small house on sale. The couple that was selling the
[8168.46s -> 8174.70s]  house split up during the renovation. So some furniture is brand new. Our house is messy.
[8174.70s -> 8178.30s]  Ed has some doubts when it comes to choosing which of the existing solutions should be carried over.
[8178.30s -> 8187.19s]  Sure. All right. Let's go quick. Clean everything. Get this trash out of here.
[8187.19s -> 8202.14s]  And then we're going to make our dream house. The maze. I have garden flipper too. Where's my
[8202.14s -> 8220.15s]  lawnmower? No lawnmower? Remember the lawnmower? The lawnmower sucked. It was so hard to control.
[8220.71s -> 8241.38s]  All right. That's the whole front yard is good. This is very messy. You're right. What are these?
[8241.38s -> 8251.35s]  Wait, I thought these were like silicone gel packs. What are these? Is this water? How did you get
[8251.35s -> 8276.66s]  this much water on the couch? On the shower? Huh? How's the bathroom doing? The bathroom doesn't need
[8276.66s -> 8284.07s]  anything. Quick. Make a piss carpet. Okay. Make a decision. What is it? This one's going to be quick.
[8284.97s -> 8289.21s]  But leather furniture is stylish. Let's keep what we have. We will choose furniture in a similar
[8289.21s -> 8295.29s]  style. Um, no, I don't like leather couches and leather stuff. You can ruin it too easily.
[8295.29s -> 8298.01s]  Give me the thing that can be wiped off with a towel if you dump a whole coffee on it.
[8298.82s -> 8315.38s]  Uh, let's go modern. Leather arm. I don't want leather. Alfred leather armchair. Okay. Paint.
[8315.38s -> 8327.46s]  Okay. Steel gray. 180. This is the kind of house I'm talking about. I'm going to love this place.
[8331.61s -> 8339.66s]  Gray. Gray. Everything gray. And then one piece of blue furniture. You will impress the shit at
[8339.66s -> 8351.24s]  anybody. Ready? Gray walls. A light blue couch. And have maybe a little bit like of a dark blue
[8352.22s -> 8362.09s]  accent. And you better make damn sure that you have something nautical on the wall. Picture of a
[8362.09s -> 8375.24s]  beach or sailor's cap or hanging on the wall. It's a prison architect. It's a Spongebob prison.
[8375.24s -> 8391.43s]  How is that a Spongebob prison? True. True. True. True. All right. Hold on. We got,
[8391.43s -> 8398.10s]  all right. Link cool down begins now. Link cool down begins now.
[8398.26s -> 8424.92s]  Every single, every single one. German look at a stream like, because what's a VTuber? I'm sorry.
[8424.92s -> 8430.97s]  I'm really bad at doing a Boston accent. I was just going to say, what is this?
[8432.41s -> 8440.09s]  All right. For a second, I don't know why my brain is just wired wrong in some places. I thought,
[8440.09s -> 8444.90s]  I see this is, I see the tweet. It's German nine eight five out of context. I was like, German.
[8444.90s -> 8450.94s]  Okay. I click it and I'm like, is that me? I was like, I didn't went German, German out of context.
[8450.94s -> 8457.06s]  I was like, did I do that at some point? Then I was like, no, that's, that's not me.
[8461.46s -> 8473.50s]  Sure. I wonder how do you get like an avatar? Do I do like an avatar stream? If I were to do
[8473.50s -> 8478.81s]  an avatar stream, I would kind of want to get like a custom one where it was just like a big green
[8478.81s -> 8490.39s]  slime and the whole stream. I'm just like role playing as the slime ball guy. That's just like,
[8491.11s -> 8502.94s]  I, I like to take breaks every like 10 minutes. Is that Mr. Green's slime guy?
[8503.90s -> 8524.26s]  Hey, welcome to twitch.tv slash slime guy TV. Mr. Green's evolved. I have to look into that.
[8524.26s -> 8539.66s]  That sounds, that actually sounds like fun. All right. Well, let's, let's start there. I don't,
[8539.66s -> 8547.88s]  I kind of do. I kind of don't though. I, I, here's what I know. I know that I just said,
[8547.88s -> 8559.30s]  I want to do Mr. Green's as the slime guy. I get it. I understand. Thanks for that. He knows.
[8560.02s -> 8566.94s]  You're going to stop that. I'm not doing that voice. That's not me that we're watching a video.
[8572.04s -> 8575.88s]  Oh, there's no video on screen. So that is just, that's just a voice talking.
[8584.84s -> 8593.82s]  All right. Slime guy, slime guy avatar stream. I think I'm going to do it on a different channel.
[8595.13s -> 8600.58s]  You know what I mean? Would you guys care? Would you guys be mad if I started a new channel called
[8600.58s -> 8607.46s]  like the fucking slime guy or something? And I just like told you guys, like you guys knew,
[8607.46s -> 8618.31s]  like I just did it and it didn't stream on German. It wasn't even me. I don't think I would tell you
[8618.31s -> 8623.16s]  guys when I was going to do it. I think that's, yeah, I wouldn't tell you guys when I won't even
[8623.16s -> 8633.64s]  tell you guys the account. So I'm going to stream as the fucking slime guy and you're never going
[8633.64s -> 8639.34s]  to even know. And I'm going to stream to nobody. I'm going to take like, I'm going to take like a
[8639.34s -> 8649.98s]  fucking week off and just stream as that guy. He's going to have 10 viewers.
[8655.85s -> 8668.79s]  How much more gray do I need? We're going to find you. I bet you will.
[8673.42s -> 8677.66s]  What if it happened to Bugleberry week? Yeah, this is kind of an evolution of that. I think
[8680.28s -> 8694.94s]  this is an evolution of that V tuber. And then I can, and then I can just,
[8694.94s -> 8701.86s]  I would just be like a different person. Like German nine at five has his life and his friends,
[8701.86s -> 8715.58s]  but fucking Mr. Slime. I'll be, I'll be a fucking V tuber. You guys will come in and tell me all
[8715.58s -> 8719.58s]  this like fucked up shit that the, that Mr. Slimes did. And I'll just be like, I don't know.
[8720.50s -> 8725.78s]  Perfect example. I used to use grandpa as a way to swear on the channel 10 years ago.
[8725.78s -> 8733.66s]  So, oh yeah, I'm ready for this one. Do you remember that? Cause it wasn't me. It was grandpa.
[8733.66s -> 8738.89s]  Oh, I didn't say that. I didn't say shut the fuck up. You fucking stupid idiots.
[8738.89s -> 8742.17s]  None of you guys have any idea what you're talking about. Like, no, that wasn't me. That was,
[8742.17s -> 8751.74s]  I could say whatever I wanted. And then I was just nice, Mr. Nice guy, Jeremy. It ain't me.
[8751.74s -> 8780.34s]  It's Mr. Slime. Slimey motherfucker. Yeah. And if anybody followed me, you better,
[8780.90s -> 8788.28s]  you better not say a single thing in chat besides talking about how disgusting Mr. Slime is.
[8788.28s -> 8796.70s]  I want you all to hate watch that stream. That's just going to go off and everyone just like be
[8796.70s -> 8803.58s]  wicked mean. This guy's a fucking idiot. Oh, Mr. Slime, what a piece of shit. Oh,
[8803.58s -> 8813.38s]  he's gross. Look, he just like shot boogers and just, I don't want a chat room. I'll be like
[8813.38s -> 8821.99s]  banning people and shit and talking tons of shit. It's not even me. I'm, I,
[8821.99s -> 8828.34s]  Jerma hasn't streamed in like four or five days. It's not me. Now here's the real kicker here.
[8828.34s -> 8835.62s]  What if Mr. Slime becomes more popular than Jeremy? What do I do then? That's kind of what
[8835.62s -> 8847.45s]  I'm afraid of. And then I have to stop being Jerma and like retire as Jerma and then be Mr.
[8847.45s -> 8871.75s]  Slime. It'd be Hannah Montana. Oh, well, we'll see. I definitely want to like figure that out
[8871.75s -> 8877.02s]  though. That would be kind of fun. What would the voice, what would VTuber voice, what would
[8877.02s -> 8881.10s]  the voice be? I'd have the effects thing on. It would be something, it would be something fucking
[8881.10s -> 8895.75s]  gross. It'd be like something like this. I'd be like, shut up. Shut up and get out of here.
[8895.75s -> 8910.42s]  Get slimed. And that would, I would, that's the person I would be banning. Okay. It is far too
[8910.42s -> 8914.98s]  big for this interior. Let's replace it with something. I hope it becomes more popular than
[8914.98s -> 8923.93s]  me. I do. I really hope so. I hope, I hope Mr. Slime, I hope Green, Mr. Green Greens becomes a
[8923.93s -> 8933.18s]  huge star. Do you keep it? This piece of how, yeah, keep it. I don't want to do anything.
[8933.18s -> 8946.14s]  Fuck doing the work. I like Mr. Slime's more than I like Jerma already. Well, good. Yeah, go make
[8946.14s -> 8961.14s]  him famous. Okay. I thought it said hang a bathtub. That's fucked up. Okay. Hanging long bulb.
[8961.14s -> 8982.57s]  Okay. Rectangular carpet crossy. Uh, grabby bus chandelier. This ain't even my house. This is just
[8982.57s -> 8986.71s]  a tutorial. What are you going to do? I'm not going to tell you when the fuck that's happening.
[8991.05s -> 8998.84s]  No, I don't care. Guys, I don't care if I waste like 25 fucking hours of my life. I don't even
[8998.84s -> 9020.31s]  care. I'm never going to tell you where it is. Enormous wooden table. I mean, this is all just
[9020.31s -> 9027.54s]  supposed to go in here. So we're just doing this for the money. Mr. Slime waiting room.
[9027.54s -> 9041.98s]  Well, this is a pretty enormous leather sofa. What am I missing here? Oh, remove, remove,
[9041.98s -> 9060.52s]  get it out of here. Okay. Oakey light colored chairs, six of them. Slime, slime, slime.
[9060.52s -> 9066.73s]  You know, like doing the Mr. Slime stream once a week or once every like couple of weeks,
[9066.73s -> 9072.49s]  like that'd be a great stress reliever. It would just be me just flying off the fucking handle,
[9072.49s -> 9086.33s]  like just talking shit. What a, what an outlet for me. This is the coffee table.
[9086.33s -> 9091.05s]  I need like, anything I, anything I need to say or get off my chest. I have just the slime.
[9091.05s -> 9105.94s]  And I'd be a mod for the slime guy. I don't, we're not taking slime guy applications. Okay. Rug,
[9105.94s -> 9112.46s]  get this thing, wherever this goes. How about over here? Just give me my money. And then I'm
[9112.46s -> 9126.28s]  buying a huge house. Slime guy. Yeah. You don't know the name of the, you don't know the name yet.
[9129.48s -> 9131.80s]  You don't even know if that's even the name of the person. You don't even know if the
[9131.80s -> 9141.83s]  person's name is Mr. Slime. You think I'm going to tell you that right now? Painting gray
[9141.83s -> 9166.54s]  derangement. Booger boy. No, you have no idea. Nope. Dr. Jerma and Mr. Slime. Okay. Wall tiles.
[9166.54s -> 9175.22s]  We need light gray. I'm almost done. I do want to see the Simpsons house though. I really do
[9175.22s -> 9185.38s]  want to just take a look at it. If we guess right, will you tell us if we are right?
[9187.21s -> 9193.06s]  Um, I think you'll know. I don't know very many other people that are currently
[9194.25s -> 9204.76s]  streaming as a slime character on Twitch. Although I mean, I may have just like started
[9204.76s -> 9216.63s]  one of your careers. Like, Oh, I got to get on this right now. Slime, slime, slime, slime, slime,
[9216.63s -> 9219.43s]  avatar, slime, avatar, start it. And now they're going to be, people are going to be looking for
[9223.08s -> 9232.01s]  wait, Otto's bed. Wait, but how am I supposed to put this anywhere?
[9232.01s -> 9234.57s]  Now you'll know the real one. You'll know the real slime.
[9241.88s -> 9249.80s]  Good. I hope there are fucking imitators. You'll find the real slime guy.
[9249.80s -> 9252.78s]  Cause ain't nobody else can do this.
[9268.95s -> 9272.39s]  You don't know anybody in your whole life that can do that. I'm the only one.
[9272.39s -> 9280.65s]  So God find the one that's doing the fake one. That's like, not even fucking close.
[9280.65s -> 9299.00s]  You're not even close. Oh, floor panels too. Five out of 15. Don't ever do that again.
[9299.00s -> 9304.20s]  I have no idea what that sounded like. Let me hear it. Blink me it. I'd like to hear it.
[9304.20s -> 9314.52s]  This guy sucks. Get your own show. This is my show. I'm on it right now, man. What do you mean
[9314.52s -> 9318.76s]  the go get your own show? This is, I'm on German. I'm not going to get kicked off my own channel by
[9318.84s -> 9331.03s]  Mr. Slime booger boy. Hold on. I want to hear this. This is important. Mr. Slime call sign.
[9331.03s -> 9336.17s]  You'll find the real slime guy. Cause ain't nobody else can do this.
[9352.14s -> 9357.10s]  Why is it so robotic? It wasn't supposed to be like that. That just sounded like you had
[9357.82s -> 9361.74s]  part of your headphones were out a little bit and you didn't plug them all the way in
[9361.74s -> 9371.06s]  before you opened up an audio file. They're going to have to work on that.
[9371.62s -> 9389.02s]  It'll be a completely original voice. Okay. Floor panel. Palisander. No, what? Palisander.
[9389.74s -> 9413.46s]  Man of five voices. Nah, I see that joke a lot. Come on. I can do a lot. I can do a lot.
[9414.10s -> 9419.46s]  Come on, Gwen. You know that. You know that. I'm not a man of three voices. I'm a man of like
[9419.46s -> 9435.54s]  seven. That's a lot. Most people can only do one. They're on. I actually kind of like that floor.
[9435.54s -> 9453.27s]  Wait, there was a whole nother room. What was that? Was that the, did you open up the wrong
[9453.27s -> 9460.57s]  file on the computer? Where was that? Is that where we put all the trash? It was the garage.
[9460.57s -> 9485.56s]  Yeah. Whatever. That was the basement. Okay. Here we go. I want to buy my own house. All right.
[9485.56s -> 9506.33s]  Let's buy. I would buy my own house browser or purchase. I was on the moon. All right. HGTV.
[9506.89s -> 9512.36s]  I want to get one of the HGTV house. What's this one? Accountants house.
[9512.36s -> 9524.23s]  Oh, this is 169,000. How big is this one? One story house from the eighties. Not big enough.
[9524.23s -> 9534.95s]  Buy the moon. I don't have enough money to buy the moon. Moon, moon, moon, moon. I don't have
[9534.95s -> 9545.08s]  enough money. Amberlee house. A beautiful house for sale. Three bathrooms and a pool. Only serious
[9545.08s -> 9556.79s]  offers. I think we can make something out of this one. What are the ones that I own? Sell the houses.
[9556.79s -> 9586.49s]  Oh, okay. I own this one. I own this one too. What is this one? Sell this one for the moon house.
[9586.49s -> 9597.67s]  This looks pretty good. Whose house is this? I didn't even do anything with this place.
[9597.67s -> 9616.49s]  Is this the wall dad house? No, this is definitely not a wall dad. All right. Let's sell it. Submit
[9616.49s -> 9628.79s]  garden. Put the house on auction. Go to the garden competition. This is an American garden.
[9628.79s -> 9636.49s]  A lot of plants. The value of the house has increased by zero. Oh, whatever. Put it on auction.
[9637.54s -> 9644.26s]  Sixty seven thousand. Ninety two thousand. Ninety four thousand. It's good here. Ninety eight. Ninety
[9644.26s -> 9652.92s]  nine. Ninety eight. Okay. A hundred. We're over a hundred. A hundred and two thousand. All right,
[9652.92s -> 9664.46s]  Dolan. Congratulations. Okay. You have no positive opinions on the house. You only have negative
[9664.46s -> 9681.19s]  things to say about this. Let's negotiate. I want an extra, uh, I want an extra sixty. I want an
[9681.19s -> 9702.14s]  extra five thousand seven hundred dollars. Okay. Well, fine. You can have it. Wait, it's doing
[9702.14s -> 9709.98s]  before and afters here too? I've owned this house for a very long time. These pictures have taken a
[9709.98s -> 9723.86s]  very long time away from each other. There are not any doors. So I have enough money for the, uh,
[9723.86s -> 9729.53s]  the meme house, right? All right. Is the moon thing, is it going to be stupid or is it fun?
[9738.86s -> 9745.45s]  I hate this house. I'll take it. I'm not selling this one. I'll sell the other one. Look at this
[9745.45s -> 9751.03s]  place. I got double fountains. No, there's no way I'm going to sell this place. I love this place.
[9751.03s -> 9771.98s]  Okay. Owned. Burned house. Family guy house. Family guy house. Slime house. I live in the
[9771.98s -> 9781.32s]  family guy house. What happened in here? I didn't even do it. I didn't, okay. I didn't even attempt
[9781.32s -> 9789.37s]  to clean anything. This is why always go look at your apartment before you sign any documents.
[9794.97s -> 9802.46s]  Yeah, let's sell it. Submit it for a garden contest. It's a Japanese style garden.
[9803.91s -> 9814.33s]  You've been just lying. I haven't sent it in. Okay. Put this on auction. Anything more than
[9815.21s -> 9829.74s]  $25,000 to this place is a, you were losing way too much money. Same guy. He likes this place
[9829.74s -> 9841.69s]  more than the other one. Nolan's buying it again. Your offer is too low. I can sell the house for
[9841.69s -> 9853.11s]  $1 more. He refused it. That would have been so funny. There are no before and after pictures.
[9853.11s -> 9860.81s]  There are only just ugly pictures. All right. If you went on Zillow and you saw these as the
[9860.81s -> 9873.02s]  photos for the place, would you do it? Would you move in? But no, but it was a reverse. So it
[9873.02s -> 9877.32s]  looked like that, but they didn't update the pictures after they renovated. They put like
[9877.32s -> 9883.18s]  $80,000 into that place to make it nice. And they're using old photos. See? That's why they,
[9883.82s -> 9895.93s]  I always say, don't judge a book by its cover. $192,000. This better not be a bad idea.
[9895.93s -> 9904.79s]  This is all the money I have. I'm not selling the, Oh right. It is the family guy. Holy shit.
[9906.33s -> 9914.36s]  Oh my God. It's the, it is. It's like, architecturally, it's the house. It's the family
[9914.36s -> 9925.69s]  guy house. I thought it was just the outside. We knew this. No, no. I thought it was just like,
[9925.69s -> 9930.25s]  Oh yeah. The yellow paint. It looked like the house. I forgot. I made the family guy house.
[9934.92s -> 9951.30s]  Okay. $492,000. Let's go buy it. Portfolio. Okay. Or purchase. House on the moon. This house allows
[9951.30s -> 9955.54s]  residents to move away from the most earthly problems. Family who moves in here may have
[9955.54s -> 9960.50s]  problems with communicating, commuting, but they unearth. Do I really buy this before any thoughts
[9960.50s -> 9981.38s]  all the money I've made in the whole game? How do I make a cool house here? Like growing weed,
[9982.02s -> 10013.21s]  garden hose. Wait, why is this in the game? I can clean with this. I ran out of fuel. I have to buy
[10013.21s -> 10035.10s]  a new one in the store. Are you shitting me? Which two garden hose? I don't have it. Emolition
[10035.10s -> 10052.62s]  triceps. Where's the garden hose? You didn't air blast. Okay. This house, this is, this is a waste
[10052.62s -> 10056.39s]  of money. I'm going to clean it up and then put it on the auction. I'm going to try to make a million
[10056.39s -> 10068.52s]  dollars. I don't like this house. It's just, no, I don't like this. Yeah. That's the plan. I don't
[10068.52s -> 10071.64s]  want this. I'm just going to sell it. I'm going to make like $800,000 and then we can buy the most
[10071.64s -> 10083.82s]  expensive stuff in the world. This house is already ready. Flamethrower, mega low. I don't, I can't,
[10083.82s -> 10088.98s]  I don't have enough. This is the most expensive house. Yeah. I'm about to make a lot of expensive
[10088.98s -> 10109.35s]  profit from it too. Flip the moon house. Yeah. That's the idea. You're already ready. I just
[10109.35s -> 10114.38s]  gotta clean it up a little. I don't need any new furniture or anything. They look, they get in a
[10114.38s -> 10136.02s]  car. They get in a weed factory. They're getting a big security system. What's this for? Okay. All
[10136.02s -> 10145.86s]  right. It's a little cleaned up. Is there an upstairs? This is just pissing into bottles.
[10145.86s -> 10158.42s]  What is this weird bed set up? Why is this in a mirror? That's odd, right? It's like an office.
[10159.99s -> 10180.31s]  Two offices next to each other. There's no bathroom. If you walked over here and you
[10180.31s -> 10186.81s]  just like got up on a cliff and just pissed into the air, what would happen? Would it slowly fall?
[10186.81s -> 10197.35s]  Or would it just kind of go into outer space? What's the gravity like on the moon? It's like
[10197.35s -> 10211.11s]  minus two, like minus like five percent earth, minus 10% or something. What is it hiding his
[10211.11s -> 10228.87s]  like piss bottles? One sixth. That's kind of cool. All right. Cool. Cool. This is all expensive
[10228.87s -> 10239.83s]  stuff. It's three fits. Look at all this stuff. What is this? I just sell everything in this whole
[10239.83s -> 10254.09s]  house. How much is this worth? $180. Why not just sell everything and then sell the moon? You could
[10254.09s -> 10258.65s]  do the garden thing. Yeah, I did the garden DLC like a year ago or so. It was a lot of fun.
[10258.65s -> 10270.26s]  They're selling a car? All right. I'm going to sell the car first. What? Go to job. I thought I was
[10270.26s -> 10280.84s]  about to give this a full letter grade. That was close. Okay. I'm ready. Would I pay for it? $480?
[10280.84s -> 10297.98s]  $482? Already made money. I feel like this guy's following me around. Starting to feel like it's
[10297.98s -> 10318.31s]  the moon, man. I want an extra $2,000. There we go. Acceptable. I made $20,000. Now let's go do the
[10318.31s -> 10326.17s]  real house. Shit. I'm burning time here. I'm burning time. It's been like three hours. It
[10326.17s -> 10346.18s]  went by so quickly. No, not into the scream voice. I'm just saying it's been, I'm just kind of flew
[10346.18s -> 10353.58s]  by. Morning maple. Thanks to the five community subs. I missed it a while ago. Thanks. I appreciate
[10353.58s -> 10372.57s]  it. Okay. $510,000. Browser. Pink kingdom. Century old house. Accountants house. Uninhabited house.
[10373.05s -> 10387.59s]  A man cave. A family house. Or Samarta Myers house. Uninhabited house.
[10387.59s -> 10392.02s]  This house was bought for refurbishment. The current owner did not have time to do it. You're
[10392.02s -> 10400.04s]  looking for a buyer. Price is final. It's not negotiable. Beautiful big house in the back country
[10400.04s -> 10405.40s]  for sale. A lucky strike for people who have value silence. Decent one to take a rest from the city
[10405.40s -> 10409.62s]  noise and other people's company. Only you, your house, and the nature around you. This place was
[10409.62s -> 10426.42s]  abandoned many years ago. This place is huge. $254,000,000? It's this one. Family house. This
[10426.42s -> 10435.90s]  one looks like it has more rooms. Why is it? What's with the, uh, the radiation thing? Does that mean
[10435.90s -> 10461.40s]  it's like something bad? All right. Which one? Um, man cave or the like nuclear house? Well,
[10461.40s -> 10469.00s]  I'm seeing a lot of both. Slime house. All right. I'm going to take a, I'm going to go piss. I'll
[10469.00s -> 10475.00s]  give you a, a straw pole right back. I'm going to refill the water I have here too. I'm going to
[10475.00s -> 10491.45s]  get up and stretch a little bit as well. So here is a straw pole. I'm going to say nuclear or
[10492.70s -> 10671.24s]  man cave. Okay. I will be right back. Okay. Post the slime guy.
[10671.40s -> 10681.05s]  No, that will defeat the purpose. Uh, it looks like, uh, nuclear is, is just, is won by a long
[10681.05s -> 10688.81s]  shot. Thank you for voting. Okay. A big, beautiful house in the back country. Let's go there now.
[10689.61s -> 10716.39s]  Make it green. Everything. You would go nuts in that house. You would go fucking nuts. Uh,
[10716.39s -> 10727.21s]  it's the Halloween house. It's the Halloween house. I get it. Okay. Sure. Well, here's the
[10727.21s -> 10732.76s]  thing about this game. Um, that's just a scary person in the house. This is a game where I flip
[10732.76s -> 10742.10s]  houses and buy property and stuff. This is not in any particular universe. There's somebody in this
[10742.10s -> 10748.58s]  house. Run, get out now. It has to be the Mr. Slime's Halloween house. Okay. I'm going to go
[10748.58s -> 10791.24s]  to the house. I don't want to look at that for this TV too. I don't want any of this shit.
[10793.22s -> 10796.58s]  No, fuck that. I'm not making a Halloween house. I don't care how haunted this place
[10796.58s -> 10803.61s]  is. It's going to be a nice family place. Yeah. I don't care. You think I'm going to let that get
[10803.61s -> 10815.93s]  to me? You think I'm going to give in to that? Nope. It could be screaming faces in the bedrooms.
[10815.93s -> 10836.41s]  It doesn't matter there. Oh, I just saw the lights, but I have to spray the house. Good thing. I
[10836.41s -> 10842.41s]  don't have any neighbors because I'm a fucking wacko. It's like three o'clock in the morning.
[10842.41s -> 10852.01s]  Get rid of this too. It's like a bloody gnome. It moved. Yeah. I don't want that.
[10852.73s -> 10877.59s]  This is not a Halloween house. Get the hell out of there. That's Freddy Fazbear's house. Oh, no.
[10878.39s -> 10891.90s]  Weeds there. Can I get this place to light up? Or is this actually the haunted house
[10891.90s -> 10905.61s]  moment? I'm not going to ever have it to be daytime. You're a terrible window cleaner.
[10905.61s -> 10917.27s]  Pretty good at picking up weeds by the lights. I mean, I'm going to light this place up.
[10917.91s -> 10926.71s]  You're going to be able to see this house from space. I don't like this being in the dark shit.
[10934.25s -> 10941.74s]  A non-descript civilian. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Appreciate it. Thanks for the subs.
[10942.46s -> 10959.54s]  Place is almost pretty clean, at least on the outside. Look across the street. What's across
[10959.54s -> 10986.52s]  the street? Any slimers in chat? Slimers. Okay. What if I just did like a, a, a, a walk,
[10986.52s -> 10990.44s]  like that German walk thing that you guys are always put down, but as the slime.
[10992.17s -> 10994.97s]  Any joke I tell, this is where it's going to be really interesting.
[10995.61s -> 10999.77s]  Because any joke I tell on the slime stream, I'm going to tell it on my stream too.
[11000.76s -> 11017.83s]  We'll see who's funnier. I'm going to battle myself. He's going to just repeat jokes.
[11018.55s -> 11046.07s]  This is going to be great. I pick up these weeds, make Twitch drama with myself. Yeah.
[11046.07s -> 11057.85s]  Get that box out of here. Okay. Well, the lights, that's always very scary.
[11058.57s -> 11068.26s]  This is going to be a little ring girl here. Why am I doing this house? I,
[11068.26s -> 11076.92s]  I don't want to be doing this. I want to do the HGTV stuff, not a Halloween. What's that sound?
[11076.92s -> 11097.80s]  There's a leak somewhere. I don't see it. It's a ghost peeing. Well, he's gone for a pretty long
[11097.80s -> 11107.40s]  time. I know what that feels like, man. It's just you. You're peeing your pants. You're going to
[11107.48s -> 11131.61s]  pee his pants. So gross. I would not want to hold this vacuum. It's disgusting. Clean this.
[11134.73s -> 11148.68s]  The lights work. I'm putting more lights. I want way more lights. Why am I doing the Halloween map?
[11153.42s -> 11172.97s]  He's dirty. Dirt. All right. Dirt. We're good. House is clean. Look in the closet. I can't.
[11172.97s -> 11186.10s]  I can't look in the closet. Okay. So what do I want to do with this place?
[11186.26s -> 11191.91s]  We're going to, with the whole, we're going to take, we're going to take care of this top floor.
[11191.91s -> 11216.39s]  I want, let's get rid of this. Check the basement. Ghosts don't like that. No,
[11216.39s -> 11223.78s]  this is not going to be a ghost house. I'm going to, in fact, let's do this now. I want lights,
[11223.78s -> 11235.59s]  lamps, lighting. Ghosts are afraid of light. Let's get the brightest shit we can get
[11235.59s -> 11240.58s]  just for now. This is temporary. Okay. Here we go. Just fluorescent.
[11240.58s -> 11251.50s]  There's a big ass fluorescent light. Yeah. Have fun scaring me now. It's going to be very scary.
[11251.50s -> 11266.73s]  All right. Turn the light, turn the lamp on. Look at that. All the lights flicker, don't they?
[11266.73s -> 11273.64s]  The lights flicker. I can't do this one. I can't. The lights are going to flicker all the time.
[11274.28s -> 11278.44s]  All right. Where's the boss that I have to like smash his head in with the mallet in the basement?
[11278.44s -> 11304.10s]  Where is it? Is that, is it like a doll? I keep hearing doors open. Okay. This is it. Here we go.
[11304.82s -> 11327.29s]  The FOV just went to like 300. It's gas. It's gas. It's not a monster at all. It's gas.
[11327.29s -> 11348.04s]  That's what that sound is. Is there anything I can do? I'm selling this house. I don't even
[11348.04s -> 11371.96s]  want to do this. I want to do a different house. I don't like this one. Bunny moved. Whoa.
[11374.28s -> 11380.92s]  Dolan gets outbid for the first time. Look in the backyard. Wait, wait, what, what, what?
[11380.92s -> 11388.50s]  Refuse offer. Did we find $6,700? But whatever. That's not, that's nothing. I'm fucking, I got
[11388.50s -> 11397.62s]  like $300,000. That's fine. Where do you want to go? You didn't get rid of the curse. That's not
[11397.62s -> 11423.43s]  part of the deal. Look in the backyard. Who's in here? Bury it. Burying the coffin will probably
[11423.43s -> 11442.23s]  break the curse on this house. Wait, what? Oh, nice. Whoa. All right. Cool. I got a house now.
[11442.23s -> 11452.28s]  This is a huge basement down here. Oh my God. You know what's going down here. All right. Let's
[11452.28s -> 11479.26s]  clean this place up. This is like $4 million. I don't want any scary stuff. Hey, basement. This
[11479.26s -> 11493.69s]  wall, the basement wall is terrible. It has no taste. Well, hold on a second here. Not wanting
[11493.69s -> 11501.32s]  Saturn devours his children on my wall is, I mean, that's like a, that's like a family den.
[11501.32s -> 11517.88s]  That's where we're going to go play like Scrabble together. I don't want like, I don't, I don't,
[11517.88s -> 11526.39s]  I don't want to look at it. Basement Scrabble. What's wrong with basement Scrabble? Why does
[11526.39s -> 11536.55s]  this keep changing? There's a lot of fucked up rooms in this house. All right. Get rid of this.
[11536.55s -> 11566.90s]  Stream the Scrabble game. No, not everything has to be streamed. I delete this stuff. Get rid of
[11566.90s -> 11573.19s]  this door. What do I want to do? All right. What did I say? I was going to make a man cave.
[11573.19s -> 11590.74s]  I'm going to think of what to do up here. Make a man cave. Make a whole house man cave. No,
[11590.74s -> 11602.49s]  that's not what I was going to do. There's going to be a slime house. The door frame with the hammer.
[11602.49s -> 11618.74s]  All green, all green. Make a smaller house inside of this house. We got to get a clean slate and
[11618.74s -> 11627.90s]  then I'll figure it out. Make a casino. It needs to be a clear upstairs. Clear. I need to, I need
[11627.90s -> 11641.46s]  time to think. Make a casino. I don't think I can even make a casino. I'll try. Your house is a
[11641.46s -> 11661.75s]  casino. Make it a hotel. Casino hotel. Make the actual house ridiculously smaller than the house.
[11661.75s -> 11667.45s]  Okay, wait. I kind of like that idea. I like that idea. I like that idea. I want to do that.
[11667.45s -> 11671.56s]  Okay. That's what I want to do first. The first thing I want to do is have there be,
[11672.44s -> 11687.74s]  can I even break this all down? I don't think I can do that. Get rid of this fucking thing.
[11687.82s -> 11697.05s]  This is the door. Where's the front door? Here's the front door and you're forced to go up the
[11697.05s -> 11702.52s]  stairs. This is going to be walled off. There's not going to be anything here. Forced to go up the
[11702.52s -> 11712.44s]  stairs and then this door here on the left is not going to be here. This is going to be just a bed
[11712.44s -> 11742.25s]  and a toilet like here. Make it a labyrinth. Rip frames. No kitchen. Now we'll make a kitchen.
[11742.25s -> 11753.40s]  It'll work. I'm going to put like, I'm going to say, okay, it's going to be like an electromagnetic
[11753.40s -> 11758.66s]  house all around the outside before I build the inside. It's going to be a bunch of like,
[11758.66s -> 11770.68s]  a bunch of like anti like 5G rays and stuff and like tin foil and stuff. I'm going to be
[11770.68s -> 11791.80s]  completely protected on the inside. I'm going to make the walls out of like steel bunker house.
[11791.80s -> 11818.71s]  It's going to be a DMT house, 5G broadcasting station, a cell tower. Just make it a cell tower.
[11818.71s -> 11837.35s]  Okay. Looking, getting there, getting there. Get rid of all this shit. That's not where I want it
[11837.35s -> 11861.98s]  to be. This is all junk. We don't need it right now. This is a great link. I think I've, I think
[11861.98s -> 11915.51s]  we've seen this before. Put that in the house. So big. This is huge photo. Fit to screen. Squished.
[11915.51s -> 11930.30s]  Put that on. All right. Maybe. No, I don't want that. I cannot fucking believe I'm about to do the,
[11931.30s -> 11939.82s]  just make a small house in the house. I, why am I doing this? This is not, I, this is stupid.
[11951.69s -> 11953.53s]  Make a big house in a small house.
[11958.33s -> 11967.34s]  No, it'll, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. I kind of like the idea of having a hotel. I don't know.
[11967.34s -> 11980.79s]  I don't know yet. I don't know yet. I need to see, I got to get a clean slate or like a big theater
[11980.79s -> 12003.48s]  with a bunch of chairs and I like a performance stage. Like the, I, the entire theater staff are
[12003.48s -> 12012.98s]  asking for a raise. No, I mean, just like the whole, the house is a movie theater. The actual
[12012.98s -> 12031.99s]  house is a movie theater. Wait, I already made a movie theater? When did I make a movie theater in
[12031.99s -> 12044.98s]  Hubslipper? Did I? I made a movie theater? No, I didn't. I made a bowling alley. I made a mall with
[12044.98s -> 12056.41s]  a bowling alley in it. I didn't make a movie theater. It's the same thing. No, just because
[12056.41s -> 12060.33s]  some bowling alleys are in movie theaters and some movie theaters are in bowling alleys doesn't mean
[12060.33s -> 12072.20s]  that they're the same thing. Okay. So this is the upstairs. This is the space that we have to work
[12072.20s -> 12092.90s]  with down here. All this space out here. We're taking on everything. I need to be able to see
[12092.90s -> 12102.84s]  everything. And it's the basement, right? The basement too. Okay. Hold on and make, make a
[12102.84s -> 12125.35s]  bowling alley and movie theater. Make it a prison. Making a maze is kind of funny and like you finally
[12125.35s -> 12150.22s]  get down here. Make a working society. Make it a maze where you have to go through the maze to get
[12150.22s -> 12167.90s]  to the bathroom. This is such a pain in the ass. Unscrew. Oh wait. Yeah. Yeah. I don't want this
[12167.90s -> 12189.74s]  to be bathroom. Okay. Cool. I like, don't mind this yet. The house is going to be green. It's a secret
[12189.74s -> 12198.41s]  basement wall. Hey, I'm shitting myself. Where do I go? Well, I would just stay put that you can
[12198.41s -> 12201.99s]  really figure out what the hell you're going to do with yourself. Running around and sprinting
[12201.99s -> 12205.43s]  and screaming and oh my God, oh my God. That's not going to help you. That's going to make everything
[12205.43s -> 12228.44s]  worse. Cool. Just make the whole house a solid wall. So I'll open it up so I can get a good look.
[12228.44s -> 12237.34s]  All right. We got a good look. Basement goes down here and so does that. The basement cannot be
[12237.34s -> 12250.63s]  destroyed. It's a brick house. I'll fix it. Make a normal house. You know, that is what an interesting
[12250.63s -> 12259.46s]  concept. Jeremy, why don't you just make a house and make it like look good and really show us like
[12259.46s -> 12283.02s]  what you would do when you designed the house. I mean, should I ban that guy because make a normal
[12283.02s -> 12293.69s]  house? I don't think I even could. All right. Demolition is done. I got 250 grand. I'm good.
[12293.69s -> 12320.71s]  Plenty of money. I'll wait outside. Shit. I have to do this too. Damn it. Dig up the coffin.
[12321.59s -> 12331.75s]  I don't even know where the coffin was. All right. We look at the entrances. We've got
[12333.70s -> 12344.34s]  these lamps that I don't like. Okay. Front door. That's what it looks like on the outside. You walk
[12344.34s -> 12355.30s]  in. You can go right. You can go left and down. This is important because, all right, here's what
[12355.30s -> 12385.43s]  we're going to do. Okay. We're going to seal this off. Okay. You can put one there. We're going to
[12385.43s -> 12395.62s]  seal that off. We're going to seal this off too. And then I'm going to make an entire elaborate
[12395.62s -> 12411.98s]  like not just try to leave. If I'm going to make a maze, I need to make it hard. Is it okay? Is there
[12411.98s -> 12423.74s]  a way that I can make the maze go down here and end up back up the stairs? Okay. I think so. Wait,
[12423.74s -> 12439.16s]  I think there is. Oh yeah. I can do that. Are you kidding me? Because then I can go like this. No,
[12439.16s -> 12459.85s]  I can't because I can't split this down the middle. Shit. All right. I need a second staircase.
[12461.21s -> 12466.79s]  You can't put a staircase. You can't remove and you cannot put new staircases in, unfortunately.
[12466.79s -> 12479.64s]  So I need to do something with this. I think this is where the illegal casino is. All right.
[12479.64s -> 12499.05s]  That makes complete sense. Start down here. Uh, more muscle store. We need to have a really,
[12499.05s -> 12517.77s]  really crazy floor. Bathrooms. Should there be a bathroom down here? Molding bag. Let's go.
[12518.57s -> 12532.10s]  Okay. Furniture. I don't need some like bar tables. See a good one. Where's a good like,
[12532.10s -> 12536.50s]  no, these are good like poker tables or a blackjack table. We need like a big circle.
[12536.50s -> 12553.75s]  How big are these? Well, they're enormous. Shelf? No. Leather. Let's do,
[12554.87s -> 12565.21s]  let's just see how big they are. I mean, they're fucking huge. There's only one game down here.
[12572.28s -> 12582.94s]  One huge game of blackjack. That's so big. It's like 15 people can play. No, no, no, no, no.
[12582.94s -> 12596.47s]  It's got to be smaller. Table, table, table. We need table. Table. Ella. Table. Mooner. There we go.
[12596.47s -> 12619.98s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. There we go. Okay. So this is like the blackjack and shit.
[12619.98s -> 12630.78s]  Slots are going to be in here. See what could be a slot? I need chairs and slots. Lamps. There's
[12630.78s -> 12645.58s]  got to be a weird fucked up lamp. That's, that's not bad. Can that be on the ground?
[12645.58s -> 12651.30s]  Wall lights. Put mirrors on the walls. Make a fun house.
[12657.48s -> 12677.14s]  Why did you pick the poop colored table? I don't know. Make a fun house. Mirror. Oh shit.
[12677.22s -> 12696.73s]  No, this is going to be fucked up. Make a mirror maze. Make a mirror maze. It's going to be
[12696.73s -> 12710.09s]  impossible to find my way out. This is going to be so trippy. It's not even, this is going to suck.
[12710.09s -> 12734.25s]  This kind of looks good. It does kind of look good. Weirdly enough. How quickly would you go
[12734.25s -> 12740.73s]  crazy if all your walls are mirrors? He's a vampire. But I thought vampires weren't supposed
[12740.73s -> 12754.17s]  to be able to see the reflection. Oh yes. Yes. This shit's going to take forever. This is going
[12765.67s -> 12777.48s]  to take forever. This is where I'm, okay. This is where I just come to meditate. You look like
[12777.48s -> 12809.72s]  you're playing a Wolfenstein level. I got plenty of money, right? You, what do you mean stop you?
[12809.72s -> 12819.18s]  I didn't, what do you mean ruin? I didn't ruin anything. Stop, stop, stop. Uneven. Fix it.
[12819.18s -> 12852.94s]  This is just a first draft. There. I got it. I fixed it. I fixed it. Are there any bigger
[12852.94s -> 12858.23s]  fucking mirrors? Seriously, are there bigger mirrors? This is going to take, this is horrible.
[12858.23s -> 12866.20s]  This is just like a solar paneled basement, which makes no sense. You come in with a flashlight
[12866.20s -> 12874.10s]  and shine it at him? What are you doing? You're just that guy that's super into solar. Yeah,
[12874.10s -> 12879.14s]  you know I got solar. I got solar literally everywhere. I got into my fucking bathroom
[12879.14s -> 12888.47s]  and powers my teeth brushes, my toilets, my lights. I don't even have a roof anymore. I
[12888.47s -> 12906.10s]  took the roof off and the sun just shines on all these panels. We're getting there. This is,
[12906.10s -> 12920.14s]  this is like room you pay to get into. This is like a fun room, right? This is the anti-5G room.
[12920.14s -> 12931.27s]  This is the 5G room. This is one of those rooms where you go in and you just shine a single like
[12931.27s -> 12938.79s]  laser pointer at the wall and he'd probably kill you. You know, it was just going to ricochet off
[12938.79s -> 12978.58s]  like 500 mirrors. He's going to kill you. Nice totally spies logic. That's so funny. Okay, when
[12978.58s -> 12984.06s]  I'm not going to do the whole house like this, that would be so painful to me. It would, I would,
[12984.06s -> 12997.16s]  it would cause me physical pain, I think. I can't do the whole house. Look at how good it looks.
[12997.16s -> 13013.64s]  That's not going to look good upstairs. Get the bigger mirror. Okay, this is the mirror house.
[13013.64s -> 13017.10s]  This is the mirror house. Mirror house. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Hot, hot, hot, hot,
[13017.10s -> 13040.74s]  hot, hot, hot. I want the mirror. I want the bed I sleep on to be a mirror. Big. Somebody said
[13040.74s -> 13057.14s]  there's a big mirror. I think that's the biggest mirror you can get. Mirror module? No, it's as big
[13057.14s -> 13072.33s]  as it gets. There's no large or anything. Wait. Mirror Lamont. Mirror module. No, I can't. This is
[13072.33s -> 13096.65s]  as big as I can make it. There's more? All mirrors. No, there's no. I mean, here's mirror. This is not,
[13096.65s -> 13108.71s]  this is not even that much bigger. On the left, on the left. Hold on. I'm getting spammed. Mr.
[13109.43s -> 13113.85s]  Slime's playing. Yeah. No, that's not what it's going to look like. It's not what it's going to
[13113.85s -> 13134.01s]  look like. Not what it's going to look like, guys. Sorry. There's a mirror category. Where's the
[13134.01s -> 13158.31s]  mirror category? Old-fashioned mirror. Mirror. Mirror. I don't think this is bigger. I don't say
[13158.31s -> 13182.17s]  mirror. I don't think it's big enough. Well, I'm going to keep going with what I was doing.
[13182.17s -> 13186.10s]  I hate this. I'm only doing one room like this. I'm never going to open it. I don't even care
[13186.10s -> 13212.78s]  what's in here. I'm only finishing this room because I have to. Sort by size. Uh, sort by size.
[13212.78s -> 13218.78s]  Sort by oldest. Descending. Alphabetical. Price. You can't sort by size. What are you? What's
[13218.78s -> 13231.86s]  this? Jebait. Okay. I'm done with this shit. I'm just going to put a bunch of weird lights
[13231.86s -> 13246.65s]  so the ricochets off and I have to dodge the laser. I also kind of feel like this is going
[13246.65s -> 13253.27s]  to break the game. If I turn a light on in here, I think that's the game's going to probably crash.
[13253.27s -> 13284.41s]  Mirror modules connect. Oh no. No. No, no, no, no. No. I can't do. The whole house is a mirror.
[13284.41s -> 13289.13s]  We're going to be here for so long. You know how long that's going to take? It's going to be like
[13289.13s -> 13297.42s]  a portal gun house. Oh shit! Okay. All right. I'm sorry everybody that's not going to want this to
[13297.42s -> 13310.04s]  happen. I'm sorry everybody! I'm sorry. Even the outside is going to be a mirror. I'm going to get
[13310.04s -> 13338.06s]  lost. Oh Jesus. This is bad. Oh no. Should I put obstacles in the way? I wish I could control Z.
[13338.06s -> 13359.46s]  I'm not going to run out of money, right? This is one of those absurd custom houses that you will
[13359.46s -> 13372.60s]  never sell. Ever. You're going to have to demolish this house. Oh HGTV presents interesting houses.
[13372.60s -> 13383.94s]  Better be your permanent residence. Yeah, you know, we decided on having full of mirrors just
[13383.94s -> 13393.21s]  so I can kind of see everything. Always make sure like nothing was wrong in the house. Why is it
[13393.21s -> 13405.75s]  Kermit? Man, I got, I got 10 voices. I really got like a lot of inspiration from insects. You know,
[13405.75s -> 13416.31s]  they have like a hundred eyes. Kind of mimic that in my real life. I mean, I get a little nauseous.
[13416.31s -> 13433.18s]  I get a little nauseous, but it's worth it. Peeing is hard though. I can't tell if the toilet I'm
[13433.18s -> 13442.07s]  peeing into is the real one or one of the mirrors. Hard to pee. But what I did is I just turned the
[13442.07s -> 13453.27s]  whole bottom into a urinal. This bathtub works pretty well. Nine more voices to go. That's right.
[13453.27s -> 13479.18s]  I'm going to have to paint that gray. If you stood in the middle. Okay. If you put like a light in
[13479.18s -> 13485.16s]  the middle of this room, I really wouldn't be afraid. I would get electrocuted. You can move
[13485.16s -> 13502.01s]  it to the left. No, look, I can't see. I can't, can't do it. Question is, can I do this instead?
[13502.01s -> 13521.10s]  Yup. Yup. It can be fixed. Hey, at least I'll be able to stand anywhere in my house while the main
[13521.10s -> 13545.86s]  character comes in and I get to go. That's cool. I get to do that. I lost. No, I can't do it. This
[13545.86s -> 13574.71s]  is already freaking me out. We're not even like a 10th of the way there, but what happens if the
[13574.71s -> 13603.18s]  guys, guys, I'm in trouble. Oh, I don't like this. This hurts. I don't like this. Your house is going
[13603.18s -> 13618.09s]  to be invisible. These need to be lower. I can't even fit these here. Uh, yes, I can actually.
[13618.95s -> 13624.33s]  Excuse me. What are you talking about? What do you mean you can't fit it there?
[13624.89s -> 13641.61s]  I can't fit it here. Shit. Remove the window. You can't remove windows. It's impossible. Break
[13641.61s -> 13651.21s]  the top first. I can't. Cause this is a, this is part of the structure. All right. What like weird
[13651.21s -> 13681.85s]  cartoon doors can I have? Pretty mirror-esque. That's pretty much a mirror. Make a mini-golf.
[13681.85s -> 13700.28s]  I'll do the outside. All right. Can I make a normal house? Like did I, can I make a normal house?
[13703.14s -> 13718.58s]  When can I make a normal house? Like, like, should I, can I do that? Oh Jesus. Okay. I'm just going
[13718.58s -> 13723.46s]  to get this done. I'm going to get this done. Get it done. Get it done. Get it done. Get it done.
[13723.46s -> 13749.00s]  Get to work. Um, what do you think I'm doing? The mirror thing was your idea. It was? No,
[13749.00s -> 13759.10s]  it wasn't. Was it? No. Somebody else said, Hey dude, put mirrors everywhere. Come on. Stop it.
[13759.10s -> 13772.02s]  It was you. All right. Hold on. Hold on. We're going. We're going. We're going. We're going.
[13772.02s -> 13783.11s]  We're going. We're going. I can't put them there. When I actually stand in the middle of this room,
[13783.83s -> 13788.87s]  somebody's actually going to puke. I need to make a really, really fair warning.
[13788.87s -> 13794.02s]  Here's your warning now. When I stand in the middle of the room, when this is done
[13794.02s -> 13800.12s]  and there is furniture and lights in here, one of you is going to throw up. I just want to make
[13800.12s -> 13828.38s]  sure that you know that now. I can go faster than this shit. Come on. Think on the bright side.
[13828.38s -> 13836.06s]  You're going to be immortalized as the genius streamer who created the mirror house.
[13836.06s -> 13850.15s]  Um, you probably should put mirror in quotes. It's misaligned. It's never going to be aligned
[13850.15s -> 13861.56s]  right. I'm going to paint it the same color. Don't worry. Security system.
[13862.28s -> 13879.88s]  Fuck it. Don't need it. I don't need lights yet. Oh, oh, I already hate it. Oh, I hate it.
[13879.88s -> 13884.09s]  It's not even done. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like
[13884.09s -> 13892.73s]  it. I really don't. I don't like it. Something in my body just wanted to just recoil backwards
[13892.73s -> 13902.18s]  and scream. This is a good idea because the burglar can't find your shit now. I mean, that's
[13902.18s -> 13914.42s]  yeah. You got that right. That makes sense. But, um, have fun stubbing your toe on every single
[13914.42s -> 13920.54s]  thing in your house. And I don't mean just like stubbing your toe once. I mean every single item.
[13920.54s -> 13925.56s]  You're going to constantly be in a state of just, just disarray. You're going to bump into the
[13925.56s -> 13929.40s]  couch. You're going to hit your head on the fucking ceiling lights and shit. Is it going to be bad?
[13929.40s -> 13945.22s]  I don't think I could, I don't think you could pay me enough money to live in this house. This
[13945.22s -> 13974.44s]  would start to really, really get to me in a week. Remember the music's driving me insane.
[13974.84s -> 13988.62s]  What should I put on instead? Ceiling mirrors? Uh, you can't do ceiling mirrors. See the only
[13988.62s -> 13997.30s]  thing that we have to escape is to stare at the ground or stare at the ceiling. Can't fit them
[13997.30s -> 14027.34s]  here. Why not? What? Bullshit. Put on Luigi's Mansion? That's not a bad idea. Oh God. I'd
[14027.34s -> 14042.70s]  prefer it to be like this. Is that real? Is which one's real? All right. Yeah. This is horror music.
[14042.70s -> 14054.26s]  I'll turn the horror music off. There we go. Horror music off and Luigi's Mansion OST.
[14054.26s -> 14102.98s]  I remember that sound. Okay. That's not bad for a second. I thought, wait, if I do mirrors here
[14102.98s -> 14126.50s]  too, right, is it going to work the way that I think it is? This is not even lined up. Is the
[14126.50s -> 14158.06s]  OST really the opening cut scene? Let's be honest. I just scared the shit out of me. Hello. Here it
[14158.06s -> 14195.08s]  comes. Right. This is the song, right? This doesn't look right. Why does it look so off? Oh, okay. Um,
[14195.08s -> 14214.36s]  okay. What is a hundred gecks? Like everyone can, I see that all the time. What's a hundred gecks?
[14214.36s -> 14246.12s]  Shit. It doesn't fit. I can't, what? I cannot believe I'm doing this, but it's, I can't back
[14246.12s -> 14264.62s]  out now. If I back out now that it's a failure, I can't back out. I have to do it. Oh, mom.
[14266.38s -> 14278.50s]  The game's having trouble rendering the actual, you know what it looks like? It just looks like
[14278.50s -> 14300.15s]  the game hasn't loaded all the assets in the house yet. It just looks blurry and fucked up.
[14300.15s -> 14306.14s]  Check settings to make better reflections. Well, one, hold on one step at a time. One step at a
[14306.14s -> 14325.72s]  time. We're almost, we're almost done with the first floor. It's already starting to have
[14325.72s -> 14339.61s]  problems. Okay. Let's do, all right. I can build a wall here. Wait, I can just do that over there
[14339.61s -> 14354.79s]  too. This house is going to give me mercury poisoning. Mercury house. We need just flat.
[14354.79s -> 14362.18s]  All right. I, this is where I really blew it. Okay. This is how I blew it. We just need one
[14362.18s -> 14373.24s]  full thing across. I fucked it all up by needing the, like, just like this, a straight line across.
[14381.27s -> 14395.00s]  Restart. I'll show you how you restart. You just pretend this wall doesn't exist behind me.
[14395.00s -> 14418.52s]  Hold R. Building distance is one meter more. Oh, cool. This reminds me of Earthbound. I get
[14418.52s -> 14449.05s]  Earthbound vibes from this. Let's go. I'm ready. Don't make mistakes. It takes longer. It takes
[14449.05s -> 14473.61s]  longer if you make a goddamn mistake. Just get it right. Fuck. Whatever. This is riveting gameplay
[14473.61s -> 14486.23s]  here. Like, holy shit. This is unbelievable. What did you do on your Wednesday afternoon?
[14486.23s -> 14496.10s]  Watched a crazy guy, uh, mirror every wall in his house. Uh, dude, just, um, like, you were ghosting
[14496.10s -> 14519.46s]  me. That you'd rather do that than, like, hang out with me? Yeah. All right. Yeah. Sorry, dude. And,
[14519.46s -> 14526.92s]  like, you know what, man? Lose my number. I just, I'm just gonna take this opportunity right now.
[14526.92s -> 14535.03s]  Like, we just don't, we don't, like, see eye to eye on anything. And you're kind of like a dick,
[14535.03s -> 14546.33s]  man. Like, I've just, I'll talk to you later. This is gonna make my house look way bigger.
[14546.33s -> 14555.56s]  No, it's not. This is just what the house looked like without the mirror wall. I'm giving myself
[14555.56s -> 14589.11s]  an illusion to a house that exists behind this wall. Why? Infinite house. Infinite housing.
[14589.11s -> 14593.19s]  All right. Okay. I'm making a house. I'm making a house. I'm making a house. I'm done. I have to
[14593.19s -> 14601.03s]  stop doing this now. My sanity is at stake at the moment. Like, I don't, I don't want to do this.
[14601.03s -> 14613.62s]  This is stupid. But, like, I could make a big... All right. All right. All right. All right. All
[14613.62s -> 14618.10s]  right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I know what I have to do. I know what I
[14618.10s -> 14652.07s]  have to do. I know what I have to do. I'm in too deep. Yeah, I am. Oh, son of a bitch. Sunk cost
[14652.07s -> 14663.50s]  fallacy. Turn up reflections. Okay. Graphics. Brightness. Graphics API. Brightness. Field of
[14663.50s -> 14673.86s]  view. What the fuck is this doing here? Resolution. Advanced. Shadows. Screen space reflection.
[14673.86s -> 14704.73s]  What is that? What do you want? Motion blur. Fog. Make it extreme? Extreme quality. Dude,
[14704.73s -> 14729.90s]  what are you doing? Monsters are going to spawn in the gap. Same Minecraft, man. He said M. He
[14729.90s -> 14754.87s]  said monsters. He said the M word. God. Okay. So, I'm just curious to see what happens. Okay.
[14754.87s -> 14764.87s]  Let me just... Give me one second. Furniture. I'm just going to put a chair in here. Okay. Just
[14764.87s -> 14809.69s]  a swivel chair. Wait. Why is it on in the mirror world but not on in the real world? Let's keep
[14809.69s -> 14839.02s]  going. Such a colossal waste of time. Jojo reference? What did I do? Actually, this is
[14839.02s -> 14861.64s]  starting to take shape. All right. Never mind. Hold on. This is starting to take shape. Dude,
[14861.64s -> 14871.85s]  is that a Jojo mirror? Oh, by the way, I saw an image of me on the internet. Somebody put, like,
[14871.85s -> 14877.21s]  Pokemon sandals on me. People just doctor photos I'm in. People were so excited that
[14877.21s -> 14882.17s]  I was wearing Pokemon sandals in this photo. And that's not real. Somebody put that in. I didn't
[14882.17s -> 14897.32s]  do that. The only thing they doctored in the whole entire picture. Why is this upside down?
[14897.32s -> 14931.51s]  This stream is going to make somebody sick. How do I get out of here? This song is killing me.
[14932.87s -> 14939.77s]  How do I get out? I have to get the fuck out. This song came on and it fucked up everything.
[14943.24s -> 14949.10s]  Okay, get that off. I don't want to hear that one again. I don't want to hear that song ever again.
[14965.96s -> 14979.90s]  Trapped in mirror hell. I'm going to make you guys the home of my dreams. I'm going to do that.
[14979.90s -> 14984.34s]  I'm going to start that shit after the mirror house. I'm getting this one out of the way so
[14984.34s -> 14990.89s]  we can go to the mirror out of here. It's not this. This is not the house of my dreams.
[14990.89s -> 15009.14s]  I'm going to sell this one. There's a guy in the mirror. There's not a guy in the mirror.
[15009.78s -> 15025.24s]  Who are you going to sell it to? Dolan. He's loaded and he doesn't care about any of his money.
[15025.24s -> 15034.81s]  I could probably call Dolan on the phone and say, hey, yo, Dolan. Can you buy my house for
[15034.81s -> 15040.97s]  $400,000? And you just say yes and hang up. Yeah, I'll wire you the money immediately.
[15040.97s -> 15045.40s]  Thanks, Dolan. I can always count on you. Yeah. Hey, if you ever fuck up a whole house again,
[15045.40s -> 15048.44s]  just let me know. If you like burn it down, you like put mirrors everywhere or you fucking like
[15048.44s -> 15059.69s]  torch it. Yeah, just let me know, man. I'll buy it for 500,000 every time. Do a Trump impression.
[15062.09s -> 15091.94s]  Um, why? I can't handle this anymore. I don't even know if those are lined up. I don't care.
[15091.94s -> 15121.21s]  It's fucking me up so bad. No, no, either finish mirror house or you have to do a political stream.
[15121.21s -> 15136.17s]  Um, how about I just say, uh, no. Yeah, I can't wait for, I can't wait for Mr. Slimes to be like
[15136.17s -> 15159.18s]  a political streamer. He would. I'm not going to, I'm kidding. Fast German versus purple alien.
[15159.18s -> 15173.03s]  Is this the music from fast German purple alien? Is it really? Nice. I mean, this is when you catch
[15173.03s -> 15192.76s]  a ghost. I know this one. Okay. Um, I don't even want to go over there. You guys gave me
[15192.76s -> 15198.30s]  Luigi's Mansion soundtrack and it's, it's the worst possible soundtrack to listen to right now.
[15206.92s -> 15220.02s]  Oh, I'm going to lose my mind. Luigi's Mansion two, any good or is it just
[15220.02s -> 15237.10s]  three only play three in one by the disappearing. I think I'm running out of asset space. Yeah.
[15237.10s -> 15241.21s]  It's getting a little sloppy. He's getting a little sloppy. He is. He's getting sloppy.
[15241.21s -> 15250.34s]  I gotta, I have to start to move. I have to get, I have to move. I seriously have to move.
[15250.42s -> 15267.61s]  I can't look at that anymore. Okay. He's going psycho. I'm kind of, man, it's like,
[15267.61s -> 15278.31s]  this is difficult to do and not to have like a freak out. Okay. All right. All right. That's
[15278.31s -> 15287.22s]  fun. That was fun. Let's put some furniture in my house. Let's do, uh, lights. Furniture. I want a
[15287.22s -> 15308.78s]  couch. I want one of these cool things right, uh, right here. More mirrors. Just wait. I'm
[15308.78s -> 15331.58s]  trying to decorate my house. Finish the stairs, but hold on a second. Fucking crack music. I
[15331.58s -> 15353.69s]  swear to God. Furniture. I need to put on, um, dining room table over here. It's just a dining
[15353.69s -> 15373.16s]  room or a kitchen. Um, okay. We'll put the, I can't, I gotta go. I gotta go. I have to stop.
[15373.16s -> 15377.66s]  Stop, stop. Turn it off. Turn the music off. Turn the fucking music off. Turn the music off.
[15377.66s -> 15408.76s]  Turn off the music. I need ceiling lights. Humanity restored.
[15408.76s -> 15417.94s]  I just, I want to just make a house. Why did I have to do this?
[15421.43s -> 15450.15s]  I could have just easily had just made a house with like a TV and here we go. Oh, I can't,
[15450.15s -> 15499.14s]  I can't look at it. I can't look at it. Oh my God. I'm trapped in a nightmare. It's a fucking
[15499.14s -> 15527.30s]  nightmare house. TV. What's big? A bed? Put in a disco ball. I'm actually, I'm actually going to
[15527.30s -> 15533.86s]  move on. I'm, this is going to kill me. I'm, I have to stop doing this. Why can I not stop doing
[15533.86s -> 15554.38s]  this? Why do I want this to crash? Why do I want this to break? I'm going to turn off some of the
[15554.38s -> 15587.74s]  lights. Some of them, only a few of them. I feel like this is what it would be like if I was in a
[15587.74s -> 15597.72s]  human fish tank. Do you know how we put shit in a fish tank? Just like, uh, fish like coral and a
[15597.72s -> 15607.61s]  little castle. Human. Plant a computer sofa and a chair. Oh, I, now I know where I am. This is,
[15607.61s -> 15620.22s]  I know my surroundings. I just open up my mouth and just like meat just falls down. Human fish
[15620.22s -> 15643.27s]  tank. This looks like a bank. This looks normal. Like it looks like a bank. What would you classify
[15643.27s -> 15654.66s]  is odd? It looks like a bank. Oh, get rid of it. Get rid of it. I don't want to look at it.
[15654.66s -> 15663.13s]  Why did I put that up there to taunt myself? All right. I'm making it. I'm selling this house.
[15663.13s -> 15668.17s]  I don't want it anymore. Sell this fucking thing. Sell it. I don't want it. I don't want this. I'm
[15668.17s -> 15674.10s]  done. Sell the house, please. I don't, I'm going to make a real house. No more messing around. No
[15674.10s -> 15678.87s]  more like joke, shitty joke shit. No, I'm not making it bowling alley. I'm not making a movie
[15678.87s -> 15684.12s]  theater. Although there could be a cool sick theater in there. Auction. I don't want it.
[15684.12s -> 15711.91s]  Put a disco ball. It's actually going for a lot. Was it the mirrors? Holy shit. Fuck the disco ball.
[15711.91s -> 15744.73s]  I'm just taking it. Why is it taking so many? You know, the house is fucked up. I got a tip
[15744.73s -> 15750.65s]  for you guys. When the realtor is only taking pictures of the same room from 10 different
[15750.65s -> 15760.39s]  angles. Probably might want to skip that one. When they just show you a photo of the outside
[15760.39s -> 15767.13s]  of the house and one of the bathrooms and you know that it's like 1400 square feet. Don't go
[15767.13s -> 15780.42s]  to that one. And look at that. Don't go to this one. But Dolan just buys every house. So who cares?
[15780.42s -> 15785.61s]  He has a grand scheme where he's going to own all the property in whatever town this is.
[15785.61s -> 15797.45s]  And he's going to be a mogul. Do they update this game a lot? From, from what I gather, I believe so.
[15801.80s -> 15805.56s]  There's been at least two or three major major updates to this game in the last couple of years,
[15805.56s -> 15814.68s]  right? Okay. I'm doing a real house. Real house. No more messing around. I'm going to get a real
[15814.68s -> 15822.09s]  house and I'm going to make it the way that I would. I would, my dream home. Okay. I have to do
[15822.09s -> 15846.17s]  this. Which one do I want though? Hmm. Family house. Man cave. Oh yeah. All right. Let's do the man
[15846.17s -> 15862.01s]  cave. Let's go. I'm ready. Now I'm sorry. I just punched you in the face. I'm ready. So let's take
[15862.01s -> 15874.01s]  a look. What are we, what are we working with here? Oh, okay. This is coming down. What's this for?
[15874.73s -> 15880.82s]  World's best dad. Well, we know who lived here before. It's a Reddit house. I got to have the
[15880.82s -> 15889.16s]  streaming room. Okay. This is going to be my garage. It is a garage. Right. Here's the streamer room.
[15889.16s -> 15892.68s]  There's going to be one. I'm going to do the, I'm going to make my exact fucking room.
[15892.68s -> 15903.56s]  Make the Reddit. This is the Reddit house. What a huge fucking yard. All right. We're going to go
[15903.56s -> 15925.58s]  outside, outside first. The spray can. Make Otto's room. I need to cut the lawn. I should have a
[15925.58s -> 15946.10s]  little like tomato garden back here. Yup. Use the lawnmower. I don't have one. I don't have a
[15946.10s -> 15956.62s]  lawnmower. Where do I get it? Flamethrower. Oh, I can burn the grass. You're right. I have to buy
[15956.62s -> 15980.34s]  one in the store. I'm out of fuel. Okay. Fuel for the flamethrower. Refueled. That's so much faster
[15980.34s -> 15999.14s]  than mowing the lawn. And I pull the goggles down and look over. Hey Tim, there's a hot one today.
[15999.78s -> 16028.42s]  You're killing the grass. Oops. It's okay Jim. Yolan will fix it. I didn't want that shit
[16028.42s -> 16053.98s]  anyways. Who wants that? This is so much faster. This is so much faster. Why clean when you can
[16053.98s -> 16068.30s]  just burn your house down? You're the neighbor looking in here. Oh my God. Mike's finally lost
[16068.30s -> 16092.70s]  his mind. Just taking care of some yard work. You know, by the way Jim, that tree's kind of hanging
[16092.70s -> 16100.42s]  a little bit far over on my side of the property, don't you think? By the way, flip us around and
[16100.42s -> 16113.29s]  pretend I'm you saying that. What I meant to say was I'll take care of it. I did it in the
[16113.29s -> 16128.07s]  reverse way. You get it Jim. You get it. We're buddies. We know each other. He's mirror mad.
[16128.63s -> 16149.10s]  Oh wait, I am actually killing all the grass. I am. I actually am. Act's not available yet. What?
[16149.66s -> 16157.35s]  The way you don't understand it when you do it this way, you never have to have a lawn. You never
[16157.35s -> 16167.58s]  have to mow the lawn. Never have to cut the grass. Never have to take care of it ever. It's just gone.
[16168.30s -> 16179.13s]  I thought this was going to take like two hours to do this out here. Nope. This is so much quicker.
[16185.13s -> 16246.02s]  WM1. Lawn mower. Wait, why am I adding grass? Yo, you melted the driveway. Oh, oh, okay. Wait,
[16246.02s -> 16271.53s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I mean, this is very important. Give me one second. Okay, I just need
[16271.53s -> 16293.58s]  this. This is important for me to do this. Hold on. Where is it? I need, I need the crit sound. Okay,
[16293.58s -> 16316.34s]  we're good. I need to be able to press this a shitload of times. Here we go. Okay, we're good.
[16317.59s -> 16328.33s]  Give me one sec. I'm just going to add this to my stream deck. This is going to be a audio.
[16329.66s -> 16342.30s]  Random crits. Yeah. The back burner. I'm back-burnering my house. Okay.
[16345.85s -> 16362.14s]  Play audio. Audio comes from. Just download it. There it is. Where did that download to? Shit.
[16362.14s -> 16370.07s]  Hold on. Is it on desktop? It's on, it's on desktop, desktop, desktop, desktop, desktop, desktop,
[16370.07s -> 16381.03s]  desktop. There it is. Okay. Here we go. Let's test it. It works. Okay. This is play.
[16381.93s -> 16413.14s]  L fade. All right. And let's go ahead and start to play the game. I'm playing. Hey,
[16413.14s -> 16447.18s]  Jim. Not the house. Oh shit. The new pyro update. The fucking hose. You got to land it directly on
[16447.18s -> 16457.85s]  their fucking head. Nice. I love this fucking target map. How do they add this? That'd be awesome.
[16457.85s -> 16472.87s]  If there was like a water spray can. All right. What was I doing? What was I doing?
[16472.87s -> 16504.02s]  Flamethrower. Not bad. This was going to take so long. Not anymore. Okay. How come this doesn't
[16504.02s -> 16513.78s]  take off the graffiti? I'm going to pave the whole backyard anyways. Don't worry. This is
[16513.78s -> 16523.85s]  supposed to be my dream. My man cave. I mean, there's going to be four basketball courts or
[16523.85s -> 16539.19s]  as it leaves the grass, more muscle. That's cool. I missed a spot. I know I'm going to get it.
[16539.19s -> 16556.57s]  I'm actually probably better off. Okay. It's ready to be cleaned. I'm probably better off just using
[16556.57s -> 16578.54s]  the actual mower now. It must be burned. All right. Look at that. It was so overgrown with
[16578.54s -> 16585.03s]  vegetation and now it looks great. It looks flat. I need to get rid of this in the front.
[16585.67s -> 16595.98s]  Not that much more. This, it doesn't want to get destroyed for some reason.
[16600.54s -> 16607.03s]  Mini golf. Oh yeah. Yeah. All right. I'll get, let me, I'll do this later. I've got to clean.
[16607.03s -> 16636.06s]  Eep world's best dad. Maybe. Maybe. Okay. That's fine. I'm going to clean the windows.
[16636.06s -> 16642.44s]  This is just so messed up. It's going to need a complete overhaul.
[16643.00s -> 16667.16s]  There is something about no one will ever be able to replicate this. TF2 did this the way that you
[16667.16s -> 16677.22s]  felt after hearing that sequence of crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit,
[16677.22s -> 16686.07s]  something about it. It was the most, it was like dopamine just flooding into your brain.
[16686.07s -> 16690.15s]  No game will ever be able to, I don't think we'd ever be able to make that feel like that again.
[16690.15s -> 16704.65s]  When you shot two crit rockets in a row in TF2, nothing can replace that. Especially if you did
[16704.65s -> 16708.17s]  it into like a little corridor and you do those like six people in there and it was just, it just
[16708.17s -> 16718.28s]  went like this. You just heard it. You'd go, it was like, Whoa, look at the kill. I got six people.
[16718.28s -> 16731.64s]  It was amazing being on the receiving end of that though, was like uninstalled TF2. Why
[16731.64s -> 16744.94s]  there random crits? This game's nice job valve random crits, huh? They hear this place out.
[16749.00s -> 16753.16s]  Like you would hear that noise or no, you would not hear that noise. You didn't get to hear it.
[16753.16s -> 16756.90s]  That's the worst part. If you get hit by a random crit, you don't get to hear the cool noise. You
[16756.90s -> 16787.42s]  just explode. Does it play fall guys? Um, no, not right now. Okay. World's best dad. Can I,
[16787.42s -> 16793.90s]  I don't think I can go around this. I mean, I guess I could put, I could put a bureau here
[16793.98s -> 16807.94s]  and just block this out until it's just world's best dad. Play Mario maker. Didn't I make,
[16808.58s -> 16816.74s]  I made like a Mario maker reference today. What was it? They don't remember what it was. Like,
[16816.74s -> 16828.17s]  Oh yeah. How like Mario maker. Why did I say that earlier? It was yesterday.
[16828.17s -> 16837.14s]  You go many extremely thinks he's the best dad. That was a good game. You were calling your fake
[16837.14s -> 16854.39s]  friend. Oh, right, right. Okay. I'll just loser thinks you can make a better dad than anyone.
[16855.19s -> 16862.49s]  I think I'd be okay. I think I'd be a pretty good dad.
[16864.87s -> 16890.33s]  Okay. So every night that's well, that's not a cool dad. I have a funny story for you. So we
[16890.33s -> 16897.29s]  get, we gave Otto this new food because of his Addison's and we're trying to like get him on
[16897.29s -> 16906.39s]  some like better food and different food. Uh, so I've been given it to him and a friend of mine
[16906.39s -> 16914.42s]  was here and the friend of mine saw me put this, this fresh like dog food into his bowl
[16915.85s -> 16920.97s]  and he thought I was giving the dog queso. He really thought that's what it was. He was like,
[16920.97s -> 16929.66s]  what are you doing? Cause it's in this, like this weird package. It like you like dump it out. And
[16929.66s -> 16935.43s]  he was just like, why are you doing, why are you feeding your dog queso? And something about like
[16935.43s -> 16942.82s]  that was just making me fucking die laughing. I'm like, why would somebody do that? Just give
[16942.82s -> 16948.66s]  your dog queso every day. Like that's fucking insane. Like, why do you think I was doing this?
[16948.66s -> 16957.18s]  There's already a man cave down here. I can't even make it mine. Is that picture of Elvis?
[16957.18s -> 16974.23s]  Who is that picture of? I don't know. Oh, lucky, lucky. No, this man cave is not, I don't want this
[16974.23s -> 16998.26s]  stuff. This is my standup comedy studio. That's where I practice all my new jokes. What are you
[16998.26s -> 17007.54s]  doing? Pick it up. Any golf? Yeah. Yeah. We got to clean this place up a little bit first. What's
[17007.54s -> 17026.12s]  wrong here? Why is there, why is there like consecration on the walls? Does it do anything?
[17027.24s -> 17036.76s]  Did I get it? Oh, what? How can I, I can't remove these. I burnt it all. That's why
[17037.48s -> 17057.72s]  I cannot remove these. That's annoying. The house is clean. There's one more piece. It's right here
[17057.72s -> 17068.86s]  somewhere. I can't, where is it? Did I get it? Cool. What color does the house, is the house going
[17068.86s -> 17083.67s]  to be? What color does the house want to be? I'm thinking make it purple, make it a mirror. No,
[17083.67s -> 17095.56s]  we're not doing that again. Not happening. Okay. How about, what about walls? Uh, light colored
[17095.56s -> 17103.13s]  medium panels, pistachio. This is kind of, yeah, this is like a Rocco's modern life house.
[17103.93s -> 17122.06s]  I'll try this. Yeah. All right. It's like Rocco's modern life. His house, the Rocco's modern life
[17122.06s -> 17136.14s]  looked like this. The cartoon house. This is a nineties house. Oh, actually, I don't know. Is
[17136.14s -> 17151.80s]  this supposed to be my dream house? I can't do that. I can't decide. All right. This is a bathroom.
[17152.44s -> 17156.41s]  Let me think of what I want. When I walk in my house. Okay. I'm closing my eyes.
[17157.29s -> 17167.19s]  Walk in. What am I looking at? Got a place to put my like keys right here. Okay. Kitchen right here.
[17168.33s -> 17174.50s]  Yep. Okay. Kitchen. This leads over to the, this is my little living room area.
[17175.22s -> 17181.51s]  I don't know if I want the bathroom there. I don't know. There's only one bathroom.
[17182.23s -> 17195.51s]  What is this place? Bedroom? Bedroom. Garage. Okay. Garage down to here. Maybe this should be.
[17196.87s -> 17201.29s]  Yeah. Okay. Stream. We'll start with the stream room. I'm going to make the stream room that I
[17201.29s -> 17211.93s]  want. All right. Stream room time. Here we go. Where is this? I need a stream room. This is,
[17212.01s -> 17221.90s]  this is bedroom. Bedroom. Bathroom. I need a stream room. Take the basement, the gamer room.
[17223.51s -> 17233.77s]  No, no, no, no. I can't. No, no. It's got to be a separate thing. Bedroom. Stream room. Basement
[17233.77s -> 17248.57s]  for VR. Okay. Yeah. We'll do this. We'll make a wall here. Kitchen. Where's the TV going to go?
[17248.57s -> 17268.70s]  This place is too small. TV here. Couch there. I think so. Just buy a bigger house. Well,
[17268.70s -> 17298.23s]  I've already committed. All right. So this is going to be the stream room. The glass house.
[17298.23s -> 17303.24s]  No, it's not. This is going to be, it's going to be nice. Use the scroll wheel to make the sections
[17303.24s -> 17311.51s]  larger. Thank you. Wow. You just saved me like a hundred years. Okay. Now we need to make
[17312.39s -> 17332.01s]  the door here. How big is it? One, two, three. That's good. Right. The basement is going to be
[17332.01s -> 17347.14s]  sick. Don't worry. This is the streamer room. Okay. The desk is going to go here. I have an
[17347.14s -> 17357.43s]  L-shaped desk and I've got the one, two, three monitors. Okay. Let's go to type in desk.
[17363.03s -> 17378.31s]  No, here we are. There we are. This is Walnut too. Already. It's the exact one. This is my desk.
[17387.58s -> 17397.35s]  Wait, that's wrong. What? Why does this feel incorrect? How would you sit here and touch the,
[17400.47s -> 17413.54s]  it's like that, right? I want it to be like that. Shit. I can't, I built it the wrong way. Whatever.
[17415.51s -> 17422.33s]  Okay. There's that. I need to make, I need to get my book and my office max,
[17422.33s -> 17450.46s]  Quadro 4000. Spell it right. For God sakes. Okay. Chair. Oh, I mean, you have to.
[17456.76s -> 17467.74s]  This is gigantic. How is this bigger than the desk? I don't know. Every time I see one of these,
[17467.74s -> 17472.06s]  I honestly, I just think about it's going to lean back and the dentist is going to come in
[17472.06s -> 17487.50s]  and just start drilling my teeth. Queso chair. Now we need monitors. Computer. What kind of
[17487.50s -> 17500.95s]  computer do I have? Uh, probably like this one. And it's under here. My computer sits under here.
[17501.67s -> 17515.16s]  Okay. Then what do you mean? What the fuck is? Oh yes. It's on the floor. Under floor, under the
[17515.16s -> 17529.16s]  desk, except on the other side. All right. Now we need monitor. Holy shit. I don't have that though.
[17529.80s -> 17542.46s]  That's me lying to you. I don't have that monitor HD. Not it either.
[17549.98s -> 17556.52s]  Monitor. I just need the little ones. I, I need to do my setup. There we are. Okay. Here we go.
[17556.52s -> 17564.90s]  Ready? This is what it looks like. I know people are being like this. You know, you gotta, you gotta
[17564.90s -> 17596.87s]  look at a glimpse into my life. Three. Yeah. Three. All right. That's good. Where's the keyboard? I'm
[17597.51s -> 17608.38s]  working on it. Backlit keyboard brushy. Oh, that's actually kind of scary. This is, this is the one
[17608.38s -> 17643.80s]  I use. Nice. Okay. Now we need a mouse. Gaming mouse pad. And then a mouse. Okay. That looks good.
[17643.80s -> 17659.42s]  And then what else is in here? There's a Reddit shelf behind me. This is pretty close. Where's,
[17659.42s -> 17670.25s]  no, there's, there's one that looks like this. Where is it? Soap is tables, desk, chairs, beds,
[17670.25s -> 17687.16s]  armchairs. Decorations? No. Where is it? It's not walls. Is it a bookcase? Installations? No.
[17687.16s -> 17706.01s]  Decorations? Accessories? No. Where is it? Put a step stool in there. No, I don't think so. I mean,
[17706.01s -> 17726.26s]  I would like to have a sauna. Books? Where? I've seen it. Where the hell is it? Oh well. Oh well.
[17726.26s -> 17744.78s]  Other? Whoa. What's this? Aquarium? That'd be cool. Shelf? Yeah. I, I, you think it would just
[17744.78s -> 17756.22s]  show up under shelf. It looks like this, except it's, it's kind of tilted. This is, this will do.
[17759.96s -> 17774.10s]  Furniture. Furniture. Furniture. Furniture. Furniture. Furniture. Furniture. I don't see it.
[17777.06s -> 17783.83s]  Wait. I think this is it. Hold on. Yep. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got it. You got it.
[17784.79s -> 17807.40s]  It kind of looks like this one, right? And then we got to put like a bunch of sound paneling all
[17807.40s -> 17818.62s]  over the walls. First, I want to paint this lime green. Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[17818.62s -> 17833.34s]  a spearmint green. Spearmint green. Paint. Here we go. Uh, faded lemon. Not a bad choice.
[17834.60s -> 17844.01s]  Spring grass. There it is. Oh, I love it. I love this color so much. It's just, it makes me feel
[17844.01s -> 17853.91s]  so good. This is a little too dark. This is too dark. It's, it has to be lighter than this,
[17853.91s -> 17883.74s]  but this is the closest it's going to get. Slime room. Guts room. It kind of is a Nickelodeon room,
[17883.74s -> 17895.72s]  but that's all right. It is a Nickelodeon room. It's because of that chair. It's the yellow chair.
[17896.44s -> 17905.10s]  Orange, whatever. You need a bucket of plaster. Oh, fuck off. All right. Let's get a bucket of
[17905.10s -> 17923.21s]  plaster. Uh, I think that mirror house changed me forever. I'm like, I'm like forever a different
[17923.21s -> 17954.87s]  person. You okay? Same, to be honest. So is Desperados 3 actually a good game? I want to play
[17954.87s -> 17967.99s]  it, but I had to, there was a promise I had to keep. I believe it is. Music being off makes this
[17967.99s -> 17983.26s]  really strange. Yeah, it kind of does. How about, um, sounds like another, uh, it's a generic shooter.
[17983.98s -> 18002.26s]  No, no more scary shit. Hackman World 2. Silent Hill is scary shit. Hackman World OST,
[18002.26s -> 18012.98s]  full soundtrack. All right, nice. I'm looking forward to this. I love this guy. All right,
[18012.98s -> 18018.42s]  let's do it. That's enough of the green. I think it looks good. I don't want the wood though.
[18018.42s -> 18024.82s]  Remember, I'm a carpet guy. I know, you know, punching, punch him, punch him, get him, kick
[18024.82s -> 18035.48s]  his ass, right? I know. That wasn't meant to be a joke. I know, don't make the crickets thing.
[18036.12s -> 18045.83s]  Okay. Floor. Floor, panels, and covering. Here we go. Green carpet. No, I'd like a, like a, like a
[18045.83s -> 18057.85s]  gray, a gray or a little blue. So gray carpet. I think I'm into the, the, this one can blend in
[18057.85s -> 18075.56s]  pretty well. That would have let the dog in. This is just like what the, this is what you hear if
[18075.56s -> 18087.05s]  you're a fucking Mike's neighbor. Hey Jim. Oh, just throwing my trash out the second story window,
[18087.13s -> 18111.34s]  trying to land it into the trash can. Have a good day. Why does he keep using Let's Plays for OST?
[18113.26s -> 18124.17s]  This is Pac-Man world OST full soundtrack, high quality. All right, that looks nice. The green
[18124.17s -> 18130.25s]  doesn't work. It's not the right green. It's not the right, it has to change. It's not the right
[18130.25s -> 18149.61s]  green. It just isn't. Wait, is it pistachio or is it ice blue? Is it pistachio? You know, don't do
[18149.61s -> 18178.49s]  that. There's no mirrors to do that with. I like it. This is not a Let's Play. You're missing the
[18178.49s -> 18195.78s]  plot. Shit, I'm missing the plot of Pac-Man world two. There we are. That's nicer. I said this is a
[18195.78s -> 18214.23s]  Miku room. Um, let's just say blue room. This is like water. Robin's egg. This is Robin's egg blue.
[18214.87s -> 18229.16s]  This is not Miku blue. It's not what it says on the can. What? This is a song. Miku blue.
[18232.90s -> 18250.95s]  I like it. It's a great color. It's just like, it's teal. We're not going to replace the word
[18250.95s -> 18270.09s]  teal with Miku blue. I'm sorry. I'm not participating. What else is even in this room? Christmas door?
[18270.09s -> 18289.45s]  What's a Christmas door? All right, internal door white. That works. What about the soundproofing?
[18289.45s -> 18305.53s]  I'll do it. Okay, good. Wait, it's not good. It's not lined up right. Looks like shit is what it
[18305.53s -> 18328.92s]  looks like. Why does it look so wrong? This looks like we leaned it in here and just didn't install
[18328.92s -> 18336.65s]  it. All right, son, be very, very careful. Don't put too much weight on the door because it's not
[18336.65s -> 18355.53s]  actually in there. It's just standing. There we go. That's a little odd. I'll fix it later.
[18355.53s -> 18365.86s]  Remember, still going strong. Yeah, I'll probably finish up here pretty soon, but I kind of want to
[18365.86s -> 18369.70s]  do this tomorrow and we'll play desperate. Okay, listen, I'm going to promise you something. We're
[18369.70s -> 18379.38s]  going to play Desperado's three tomorrow, but I'm going to do this too. Okay, I have to make you guys
[18379.38s -> 18389.62s]  my whole house. More house flipper. Yeah, I'm going to open with this. We'll play this for a little
[18389.62s -> 18402.38s]  while and then we'll move to Desperado's three when I'm done with my new house. When am I going to end?
[18403.46s -> 18410.58s]  Um, I don't know. Probably soon though. We are encroaching on like the five plus hour mark
[18410.58s -> 18413.94s]  and that's when I need to start to be cautious of how long I've been sitting down,
[18416.70s -> 18427.90s]  but we're good. Desperado's is going to get shafted. It's not, I promise. What else is,
[18427.90s -> 18431.66s]  that's all I have in my room. Everyone thinks, dude, I wonder what's like in any interesting
[18431.66s -> 18457.16s]  shit in like a streamer's room. No, wait, hold on. Hold on a minute. Uh, let me fix it. You want to
[18457.16s -> 18466.65s]  see what it looks like? What a streamer's room looks like? Is there any bags of trash that are
[18466.65s -> 18486.60s]  available? Give me one second. Give me one second. I, I need to turn the camera on just so you guys
[18486.60s -> 18552.30s]  can fucking understand what I'm talking about here. One sec. Okay. So I didn't do anything.
[18553.02s -> 18563.70s]  I had to just get this out of the way. Just like clockwork. Right. Right. Right. Okay. So
[18564.58s -> 18570.47s]  I'm going to show you guys the ground in my room. I don't know why some of this stuff is even here.
[18581.46s -> 18586.92s]  Yes, by the way, those of you that are asking, I know I'm going to get a lot of questions about
[18586.92s -> 18591.96s]  this, but there's a very specific reason why. No, that's not going to be shit on the ground.
[18594.50s -> 18612.94s]  Hope not. Uh, there's like a trash bag, this Elmo and like a bunch of cords and shit.
[18619.10s -> 18629.06s]  That's not a torture me Elmo. No, I don't know why that's in here. I really don't know.
[18633.32s -> 18655.34s]  That's like, I, Kim got that stuff for some reason. It's not a torture me Elmo. This room is a
[18655.34s -> 18667.11s]  fucking mess, but I have to clean it. I know, but that's what I'm saying. I was trying to go,
[18667.11s -> 18676.70s]  I wish I could go find the trash bags that I deleted. You have your documents all over the
[18676.70s -> 18694.23s]  floor. Yeah. I did that before. Oh, cool. That actually lights up perfectly. Okay. That looks
[18694.23s -> 18702.47s]  good. There's not trash in there by the way. It's storage. When you run out of places to put shit,
[18702.47s -> 18704.71s]  it's like, okay, what am I going to do with that? I'm going to put this in a trash bag.
[18704.71s -> 18712.92s]  That's all I have right now. It's storage right now. That's not trash. That's storage.
[18712.92s -> 18717.56s]  Why a trash bag? Cause it's a huge thing that like all the commercials, you can't rip through
[18717.56s -> 18720.68s]  them. They're so hefty. They're so hard to break through. So why don't you use it for like a bunch
[18720.68s -> 18729.74s]  of shit? All right. I got that room. This is literally the cleanest my fake room has ever been.
[18729.74s -> 18755.45s]  The food. Okay. I also need, um, like laptop. What's going on? Socks. What is going on?
[18762.62s -> 18778.47s]  It's Christmas time at the streamer room. The disc is skipping. No, get this out of here. No,
[18778.47s -> 18782.79s]  I'm a clean guy. Right? I need to do the, the, okay, this is the, I'll show you. This is,
[18782.79s -> 18791.98s]  this is going to be fun. I just need, um, just like foam walls. It might actually have to be,
[18792.54s -> 18798.58s]  I don't know, like what would, what's just like a, like a thing that's like a square that's black
[18801.22s -> 18812.46s]  like a hang clean or not. You have to eat. Yeah. I know a box, a mirror. No,
[18816.90s -> 18821.10s]  got to be able to sit on the wall. This guy has to be one of the lights.
[18821.74s -> 18828.09s]  It has never turned on. I'm supposed to make my streamer room. If I don't have all my cool foam,
[18828.09s -> 18846.82s]  dude. Damn it. Oh, nevermind. You search foam. I would, why foam be here? Maybe a painting.
[18847.38s -> 18854.30s]  I'd have to upload a custom painting. Yeah. I'll use a picture of it. Yeah. I'll do that tomorrow.
[18857.93s -> 18866.25s]  Oh, that whatever. I just saw it and I just, I cleaned it off. Okay. Here goes the, there it is.
[18867.54s -> 18876.70s]  So here's the front door. I need, first of all, what do I want to have my floor here? I think I'm,
[18876.70s -> 18899.96s]  that looks kind of nice. Yeah, it does. I love it. I love the smokiness to it. Tile floor, tile floor,
[18899.96s -> 18906.44s]  tile floor, tile house. Um, I'm not sure how many of you guys live in the Southwestern United States.
[18907.24s -> 18926.62s]  Um, you got, you gotta have some tile somewhere. Shit gets hot, hot, hot. Oh, this is, I like this.
[18926.62s -> 18934.41s]  I really like it. I really like this. This is sick. Okay. Now we need a cool, uh, kitchen
[18935.35s -> 18948.94s]  panels. How about, hmm, maybe, um, maybe like this, like a sand, sand. I think I like this, a sand.
[18956.34s -> 18963.54s]  At least you're having fun. Yeah. Oh yeah. This music is a little kind of getting to me though.
[18964.10s -> 18968.38s]  That's better. It's a little, it's too much. It's like playing in my brain.
[18970.17s -> 18993.22s]  Ball panels. What a cream. Cream works. Look at that. This is a house that you can just look
[18993.22s -> 19015.50s]  so good. You could just eat it. This is resident sleeper. Don't resident sleeper me. Don't do it.
[19015.50s -> 19021.85s]  Don't you do it. You guys like keeping logs of me. Well, I got logs of all you resident sleepers.
[19022.41s -> 19040.26s]  I don't know. How does it look bad? Now we brighten this up a little bit. We add a little,
[19040.26s -> 19057.21s]  we get some color in here. Eat them. No mirrors. That's the, I can't. Okay. Can I nominate just
[19057.21s -> 19062.95s]  the portion of the mirrors for worst stream in 2020? Like I can, I do that. Just that portion,
[19062.95s -> 19068.60s]  just like that, like 30 minutes. That's all. Everything else has been really fun,
[19068.60s -> 19076.23s]  but like I hurt my, my, my body hurts from that. My whole body hurts. All right. Cool. Nice. Nice.
[19076.39s -> 19091.75s]  Clean these windows. Yes. Another two month break. These are the mirrors.
[19093.03s -> 19102.26s]  I remember because this is my, uh, save file. Remember how long this takes when you don't have
[19102.26s -> 19114.89s]  any of the upgrades is so horrible. What the fuck are they saying? Cigarette house, something house,
[19114.89s -> 19126.97s]  something house, cigarette house. Do not say that because I will make like a filter and then the
[19126.97s -> 19132.57s]  actual cigarette and then the yellow, I'll make the cigarette house. I'm not doing mirror too.
[19133.21s -> 19182.94s]  What are you doing? Why is it not showing up? Where is it? There's this, this is not a,
[19184.07s -> 19187.67s]  no, I'm not even giving, I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of me saying it.
[19188.74s -> 19196.74s]  This is not that this is not a cigarette house. This is smoky white and black and, and like cream
[19197.38s -> 19200.66s]  with some accents. It's going to be some black furniture. There'll be a couple,
[19200.66s -> 19211.62s]  there'll be maybe some oranges here. It's looks, this is a good look. Okay. So
[19212.82s -> 19218.26s]  not all the walls have to be like that. Just these ones here. All right. Let's go this way.
[19218.26s -> 19249.38s]  This is the mega milk house. It's Oreo cookies and cream. That's a good look. It's not a cookie.
[19250.26s -> 19266.44s]  Okay. Lower. I'm going to put a wall here. God damn it. This is a school cafeteria.
[19288.12s -> 19292.71s]  Why does it have to be perfect? You could have said anything else and it could have been kind
[19292.71s -> 19300.01s]  of accurate, but it is so accurate that it's making me angry how accurate it is. So angry.
[19313.43s -> 19321.29s]  That's pretty good. That's got to be best chat joke of the week. I think it's up there for me
[19321.29s -> 19344.65s]  for sure. Okay. Oh, this room's ugly. Sorry. Sorry. Okay. Okay. I need another. What the hell is this
[19344.65s -> 19360.44s]  room? It's a 12 year old room. What? I want to know the 12 year old that has a triple monitor
[19360.44s -> 19369.30s]  gamer room set up. Hey, what, what, what is, what do I always say? If that's the case,
[19370.23s -> 19378.98s]  how many plants they got in there? How many plants they got in the corner of their houses?
[19378.98s -> 19389.74s]  When I was a kid, I had this whole shit box HB computer that the tent was wrong and it got
[19389.74s -> 19397.74s]  really hot. It was the shittiest computer ever and it got super hot and I was sweating my room
[19397.74s -> 19411.88s]  all the time. I would play Diablo 2 on it and Team Fortress classic. Make the green room meat wads
[19411.88s -> 19433.91s]  room. You guys, are you guys, how are you guys this on point today? Holy shit. You guys are on
[19433.91s -> 19441.96s]  fire today. This is the Aqua teen house. Isn't this Frylock's room? Doesn't he have like a cool
[19441.96s -> 19451.22s]  computer? This is Frylock's room. This is Meatwad's room. And then this is Shake's room. This is the
[19451.22s -> 19457.42s]  TVs right here. No, no more cartoon houses. I don't want to make a family guy. I don't want
[19457.42s -> 19462.55s]  to make the Simpsons. I don't want to make Aqua teen. Yes. Holy, this is the Aqua teen house.
[19462.55s -> 19484.68s]  That's the exact house. How did this happen? I don't understand why you're an idiot and I'm
[19484.68s -> 19490.18s]  going to throw this thing on the floor and it's going to explode. And I don't know what you're
[19490.18s -> 19495.80s]  talking about, man. I think you're going to shut your mouth. The little guy has a mouth on him,
[19495.80s -> 19508.63s]  I think. That's too bad. What's going on in here? I'm leaving. I'm gone. I'm gone. I'm gone. I'm
[19508.63s -> 19513.11s]  gone. I'm gone. I'm gone. I'm out. I'm out. I'll see you tomorrow. I was so bad. I have to fucking
[19513.11s -> 19530.06s]  end the stream. I have to turn the stream up because that was so awful. Jera's life is a
[19530.06s -> 19535.42s]  cartoon. No, it just happens. It just ends up that way for no reason. It just ends up like this.
[19537.29s -> 19553.24s]  I have no control over this. All right. I'm fixing this end of stream fry lock. I'm so
[19553.24s -> 19577.43s]  fucked up right now. All right. I got to get a front door. This guy's fucked up. I'm not
[19577.43s -> 19586.30s]  fucked up. You're fucked up. Oh, it's not me. It's you. I didn't do anything. And by the way,
[19586.94s -> 19592.73s]  Merry fucking Christmas. No, no, that's not how I'm going to end this. I'm not ending it that way.
[19594.78s -> 19604.84s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to. Okay. I'm done. Everybody just relax. Okay. I'm going to
[19604.84s -> 19624.42s]  do the bathroom. Whoa. Look at all this stuff. There's an AC unit. An amountable AC unit. A
[19625.14s -> 19636.22s]  unit. Stop. Stop it. You guys are a bad influence. No, let's just. What about for walls in here?
[19641.05s -> 19651.75s]  Uh, I'm thinking I'll do a grandma house or Minecraft grandma house or I've only played
[19651.75s -> 19687.32s]  Minecraft for two hours. My whole house looks like this. Uh, 3D is a 3D. Yeah. That's fucking
[19687.32s -> 19703.98s]  ugly. It looks like instead of a beehive, sell this shit. Get this out of here. Here's the,
[19703.98s -> 19710.38s]  okay. The problem that I have with decorating places is I, everything that is not just gray,
[19710.38s -> 19718.71s]  white or beige, just, it's just crazy, right? It just looks crazy. How do you design anything?
[19718.71s -> 19748.97s]  I don't understand. How do people make anything look good? Like this just looks crazy. This is
[19748.97s -> 19768.89s]  pretty cool. This is what every single high-end hotel bathroom looks like. Put carpet in the
[19768.89s -> 19776.01s]  bathroom now. No, I already did that before and I don't want to do that again. That sucks. Pretty
[19776.01s -> 19800.22s]  cool. Resident sleeper. Hey, wake up. Oh, cool. I guess. Real cool. I guess. What happened?
[19800.22s -> 19807.56s]  Windows in a bathroom. Yeah. I don't get that either. I don't know why they would ever be a
[19807.56s -> 19814.82s]  window in a bathroom, especially windows that are at somewhere around waist height on a first floor,
[19814.82s -> 19823.99s]  waist height. If those blinds are up and I look at like, just think about that. I think we've had
[19823.99s -> 19826.95s]  this exact conversation before, but there's a lot of potential new people here that I want to bring
[19826.95s -> 19833.58s]  this up to. If you're peeing right here and this window is right there, why would you ever want the
[19833.58s -> 19843.02s]  opportunity for like the paper boy to just drive by and look over or anybody literally doesn't matter
[19843.02s -> 19861.16s]  who? In fact, I'll go one step further. Every single blind in my entire place, doesn't matter
[19861.16s -> 19873.93s]  where I am, is permanently closed. You guys like that too? They're never open because I know one
[19873.93s -> 19878.73s]  day I'm going to like lock eyes with somebody outside of my window. There's going to be somebody
[19878.73s -> 19883.61s]  like just out there and we're going to lock fucking eyes and it's going to be like, oh shit.
[19884.17s -> 19892.87s]  Uh, okay, then get away. No, I, all blinds closed everywhere. No windows, no open windows ever.
[19892.87s -> 19914.36s]  Why is it kind of like this? That doesn't seem very healthy. Is it? I'm doing another funny
[19914.36s -> 19925.93s]  aquatine impression. I'm like getting out of here very soon. Social interaction. I'm sorry, but
[19925.93s -> 19932.09s]  walking eyes with a random person from your neighborhood or from like your outside of like
[19932.65s -> 19940.63s]  apartment complex. It's just odd. I don't want to do that. Who wants to do that? I don't want
[19940.63s -> 19945.99s]  people to see me like fun. Plus I'm naked all the time. Right? So when am I, why would I,
[19945.99s -> 19956.54s]  what opportunity would I ever have to have any windows open? I'm constantly without a shirt,
[19956.54s -> 19966.55s]  at least. So what opportunity are the windows ever going to be open? He's naked right now.
[19966.55s -> 19974.84s]  I actually am not. I have clothes on today. This music is way too intense for what we're doing.
[19977.24s -> 19989.45s]  Proof it. I actually, you know what? I actually can prove it. I can prove it. No, I can't. The
[19989.45s -> 19997.35s]  webcam is unplugged now. How? It doesn't make any sense. You saw me like four hours ago when
[19997.35s -> 20016.22s]  I turned on the webcam. What are you talking about? All right. Installations. Toilet. No,
[20016.22s -> 20030.71s]  this sink is, there you go. Okay. It looks good. Toilet. I feel like I keep hearing this music in
[20030.71s -> 20062.12s]  every Spider-Man movie. Okay. How about this one? Toilet standard. All right. Stick it on. On. I
[20062.12s -> 20067.08s]  have to go. I have to go. I gotta go. I'll pick up tomorrow. Don't worry. We'll pick up tomorrow.
[20068.54s -> 20080.12s]  Crossing that out, that mark where I have to, I have to get up. I gotta go. I gotta go. I will pick
[20080.12s -> 20085.48s]  this up exactly where we left it. And I'm going to be, we're going to make it happen. We're going to
[20085.48s -> 20091.50s]  do a whole mini golf course back here. And then I'm going to pretend to you guys that I'm going
[20091.50s -> 20096.62s]  to play Desperados 3 tomorrow, but four or five, six hours is going to go by tomorrow.
[20097.35s -> 20103.21s]  And I'm going to be like, oh shit, well, we'll do that later. The plan is to do this and then
[20103.21s -> 20107.80s]  play Desperados. And look, maybe we just play Desperados like a few days later, a couple days
[20107.80s -> 20118.04s]  later, whatever. Hey James, thanks for the 10 subs. Thank you, James. A lot of people are today.
[20118.04s -> 20128.07s]  Hope you enjoyed the stream. Thanks for stepping by. We'll see you tomorrow. Thanks guys. I missed
[20128.07s -> 20135.67s]  massive bits. Holy shit. I did. There's a hundred bucks, 10,000 bits from Stormy 2. Thank you for
[20135.67s -> 20142.68s]  the a hundred dollars. Is Pac-Man totally tubular or radical man? Totally tubular. Is it the very,
[20142.68s -> 20153.90s]  very simple question for me to answer, but thank you. That's a ton of money. And I don't, I know,
[20153.90s -> 20160.90s]  I, like I said, I don't read it's anymore, but people still decide it's a good idea to give me
[20160.90s -> 20169.54s]  fucking hundreds of dollars. And I just hope you think it's worth it. Thank you. I will see you
[20169.54s -> 20181.37s]  guys tomorrow. Good night. Goodbye. Have a wonderful rest of your day. Let's do the credits.
[20181.37s -> 20198.81s]  Oh, that's, that's Elmo. That's the picture of, why is that sea dead? He's not dead. He's just
[20198.81s -> 20211.69s]  sleeping. He sleeps on his stomach. This saves the game automatically. Yeah, it does. What music is
[20211.69s -> 20217.67s]  playing? All right. Pac-Man. I forgot. I thought, why did I think that was in House Flipper? All
[20217.67s -> 20228.07s]  right. Thanks everybody for subbing. Here they come. Just a moment. Yeah, there's a bunch of
[20228.07s -> 20234.39s]  other stuff that I have too. I want to do custom robo. I want to play ghosts of Tsushima too,
[20234.39s -> 20241.34s]  but I don't even know if I'm going to stream that. I have no idea. When I took off that couple of
[20241.34s -> 20249.93s]  months, I created a gigantic backlog of tons of things that I now need to figure out when they're
[20249.93s -> 20269.10s]  going to happen. But thanks a lot. It's broken again. And I even, I had, why is this doing this
[20269.10s -> 20285.86s]  again? I had it open. Did I, I did. I had, am I going to play Paper Mario? Yes, I will play.
[20285.86s -> 20294.47s]  I promise I'll play Paper Mario. Thanks big buddy. The only guy again, two subs and two streams.
[20296.25s -> 20303.43s]  We're on a roll. God damn it. All right. Well, I don't know why this is happening again.
[20304.63s -> 20317.93s]  Wasn't it open? I, by tomorrow, this is going to be fixed. If it ain't, then okay. If this is not
[20317.93s -> 20324.01s]  fixed tomorrow, if this doesn't work tomorrow, I want the stream after that to only be Jerma
[20324.01s -> 20337.67s]  punching emotes until I'm, I have to stop the stream. Okay. Bring the winks back. No, the winks,
[20337.67s -> 20343.88s]  I can't do the winks anymore, but I'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll pick up right where we left
[20343.88s -> 20351.70s]  off. Good night. Goodbye. Have a wonderful rest of your night. See you tomorrow. I had a great,
[20352.34s -> 20403.69s]  time. Abrupt ending. Everybody's saying raid, raid, raid, raid, raid. Uh, what do you, who's,
[20403.69s -> 20418.34s]  who's live right now? Raid Mr. Slime. That, that's me. Actually, that's me.
[20431.26s -> 20452.95s]  Raid a small account. You should, you want to, you want to raid Nyaners?
[20458.87s -> 20473.66s]  All right. Yes. Are you, all right. I, are you guys going to be nice?
[20474.22s -> 20494.57s]  Am I going to just diary you guys on a channel we've never been to before? Raid Rev. This is
[20494.57s -> 20508.66s]  going to be, this is going to be a toss-up. Raid GDQ. Oh, fuck. GDQ is going on. Oh my God. I know
[20508.66s -> 20517.08s]  I, I'm so happy about that. I love staying up till like fucking four in the morning and watching
[20517.08s -> 20534.28s]  people beat Nintendo games. Do them both. Raid Nyaners now or, or punch you. You guys better be
[20534.28s -> 20538.84s]  fucking nice. I swear to God, if I get word, if I get word back that you guys were fucking like
[20538.84s -> 20543.48s]  mean or fucked up, I'm going to, you're going to hear from me. You're going to be in big trouble.
[20543.48s -> 20558.50s]  You're going to be grounded. All right. We'll do that. And then I'm going to raid GDQ and then
[20558.50s -> 20563.46s]  I'm going to, can I even do that? Can we bounce around? I don't think you can even do that.
[20571.51s -> 20580.66s]  Let me see if I can do like a raid bounce. All right. Here we go. Be nice. Be nice. I don't,
[20580.66s -> 20585.06s]  I don't even know who this person is. Like, so I'm just, Hey, great. All right. Let's, let's go.
[20585.06s -> 20601.32s]  Fine. Here we go. You ready? I'm doing, I'm doing it. Don't raid bounce. We did that before
[20601.32s -> 20613.61s]  Joel and I ended up hosting the league of legends channel and I, I, I hosted the league of legends
[20613.61s -> 20626.04s]  channel for like fucking four straight days. All right. Here we go. Go say hello. Tell them about
[20626.04s -> 20649.66s]  my, my Mr. Slime stream. I'm not leaving this channel. All right. Goodbye. I'll see you tomorrow.
