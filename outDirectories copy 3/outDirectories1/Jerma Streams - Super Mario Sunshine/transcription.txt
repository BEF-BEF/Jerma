[1.08s -> 15.69s]  Hey, what's going on? How's it going? I am holding back some excitement here. I am so excited
[16.33s -> 24.78s]  because today I'm gonna be playing Super Mario Sunshine for the first time in my whole life.
[27.30s -> 33.03s]  I turned 37 this year. I have never pressed jump once. We're gonna do it together
[33.91s -> 113.90s]  on Super Mario Sunshine. Can't wait. I'll be right back. See you. Okay. Are you guys ready?
[113.90s -> 122.76s]  Are you ready? Should we watch the opening cutscene? This is back in 2002. The opening
[122.76s -> 128.38s]  cutscene just kind of plays before you press start and it replays sometimes randomly. That's
[128.38s -> 139.54s]  how opening cutscenes worked. Take as much time as possible. Take as much time as possible.
[141.03s -> 147.11s]  You really want me to do that? Wait, the cutscene is five minutes long?
[150.18s -> 153.22s]  What has there ever been a five-minute Mario cutscene? What is this, Kojima?
[153.86s -> 162.84s]  Come on. I don't have time for that. I don't want to do any of that other shit. All right. Well,
[162.84s -> 169.50s]  this is not the cutscene. How do I get the cutscene to play? Are you ready?
[170.70s -> 174.89s]  Here it is. Adjust the screen a little bit. But here it is.
[176.94s -> 185.27s]  Are these spoilers? These are spoilers. I'm not gonna look at the screen. I'm not looking at the
[185.27s -> 194.58s]  screen. I'm just fixing the aspect ratio. That's all I'm doing. There could be something on the
[194.58s -> 198.98s]  screen right now. I don't know what it is. I'm a little liar. I can obviously see the screen
[200.34s -> 207.06s]  because I'm moving it. I'm moving with my hand. Don't worry. I can't see the screen.
[211.30s -> 217.78s]  All right. We wait for the cutscene. Hold on. I'll get this. You gotta get it perfect.
[219.13s -> 222.89s]  This is the most classic fucking GameCube video game ever. You think I'm gonna have like a fucked
[222.89s -> 229.85s]  up aspect ratio? Nope. All right. Should I press start or should I wait for the cutscene to play?
[230.49s -> 242.68s]  Start. Do you want to create a file for this game on the memory card in slot A? Yes. This
[242.68s -> 253.35s]  actually looks pretty good. I've never played this. It's actually kind of insane. I've never
[253.35s -> 264.68s]  played this game. All right. A, B. Let's go with B. Start. Oh, here. Oh, yeah. We got the opening
[264.68s -> 272.57s]  cutscene. Oh, shh. Quiet. Our subtitles, subtitles. Our subtitles. Oh, don't worry. It's gonna be four
[272.57s -> 307.03s]  different words. It's oh and whoa. Please explain. What the fuck? Oh, shit. They don't just talk in
[307.03s -> 314.41s]  one word. Like, ooh, they used to do that. Is that Mario talking?
[317.14s -> 323.78s]  Concerned with the well-being of the princess in this dreadful heat.
[324.34s -> 328.42s]  Master Mario, if you would, cross over to that shore and find some assistance.
[328.42s -> 336.71s]  Yes. Mario, be careful. I have a bad feeling about this.
[339.86s -> 351.83s]  Holy shit. It's so fucking fluid. Holy shit. It's so fluid. How do I get out of the water?
[358.34s -> 367.93s]  You have to do. It's the most fluid game I've ever played in my life. All right. Let's go.
[368.57s -> 378.34s]  He's struggling already. They all talk. It looks like this gunk is coming from somewhere below.
[378.98s -> 382.82s]  It's really slippery. So watch your step. You don't even haven't done something in your whole life
[383.54s -> 387.22s]  and you've anticipated this moment your entire life. And now that you're doing it, you're like,
[387.22s -> 393.46s]  fuck. I don't like the anticipation. This is like, I don't want to do this. I want to constantly
[393.46s -> 402.17s]  never have played this game. All right. Let's go. What about you? What are you waiting for?
[402.17s -> 411.16s]  Do something. This gooey paint of yours completely covered by friend. Well, come on,
[411.16s -> 421.56s]  kids. This is paint. What's going on over here? Help. Help. Are you crazy? We're the ones who need
[421.56s -> 446.87s]  help. Take that water pump and clean the airstrip. You. You. Where's the pump? Like insane? Step on
[446.87s -> 457.35s]  it. I mean, the pump is right there. Do I have to like turn it? Use the pump? Can I just use it?
[457.99s -> 474.54s]  Where's my, uh, where's my thing? Even the flood is right there. I thought this was a person. I
[474.54s -> 478.86s]  thought, okay, I thought that was a person. I thought this was a person. I've never seen this
[478.86s -> 482.94s]  thing. What it looks like. I thought, I thought this was a duck. I didn't think this. I thought
[482.94s -> 487.66s]  I'd never seen this thing up close before. This thing talks. I thought it was a fucking backpack
[487.66s -> 510.73s]  in Smash Brothers. I didn't know what this was. It is the backpack from Smash. Yeah,
[510.73s -> 516.74s]  but I never see it up close. I just, I get annoyed by it. I've never seen this up close.
[519.38s -> 528.54s]  You press the R button all the way down. You can stop and shoot. You can then use the control stick
[528.54s -> 536.94s]  to aim in any direction. Press the X button to switch to the hover nozzle. You can then press
[536.94s -> 546.14s]  the R button to hover in the air for a short time. If this tank is empty, no water can be sprayed.
[546.14s -> 559.74s]  To refill tank, enter a body of water and press the R button. Yup. Instructions complete. Proceed.
[566.86s -> 580.55s]  Mario. All right, we need water. Got it. This is the most fun game I've ever played in my whole
[580.55s -> 609.18s]  life. I have to clean everything. I'm going to clean every single thing. I can't play this game.
[609.18s -> 615.26s]  I have to leave. No, I can't. This is Luigi's Mansion 3 all over again. It's never going to
[615.26s -> 621.38s]  stop, guys. I'm never going to be able to do this. There we go. All right. I can't do it.
[622.18s -> 642.94s]  I don't think I should play this. Right in the face. This is so cool. Did this win any Academy
[642.94s -> 655.06s]  Awards or anything? Did it win like game of the year? Sorry, I'm talking kind of loud because I
[655.06s -> 660.50s]  bulked headphones in for the first time in like three years. I am talking like this a vacuum cleaner
[660.50s -> 685.78s]  running and I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. Yeah. Ooh, Mario B. Where's the, um, the only song
[685.78s -> 702.52s]  I know? I don't think that's, I don't like how that thing talks. I mean that, that like Kazooie
[702.52s -> 706.92s]  motherfucker, like they knew what they were doing with Kazooie. This is Banjo Kazooie with Mario.
[707.56s -> 718.60s]  Why am I arrested? Court is now in session. As you are no doubt aware, someone has been senselessly
[718.60s -> 724.68s]  defacing Fair Isle Delphino using some paint like substance. The accused is charged with
[724.68s -> 733.18s]  moving our beautiful home and yes, endangering our very way of life. Indeed, how can one not be aware
[733.18s -> 739.50s]  of what is going on? Though it is daytime in Delphino Plaza, our poor residents tremble beneath
[739.50s -> 746.70s]  the veil of darkness. Expert shine scholars have determined that this darkness has arisen because
[746.78s -> 753.18s]  all of our guardians, the shine sprites have vanished from their gathering spot at the shine
[753.18s -> 762.34s]  gate. The reason? It's quite obvious. This horrible graffiti is to blame. Behold the sketch of the
[762.34s -> 769.94s]  perpetrator based on eyewitness descriptions. The truth is obvious. The guilty party sits among us.
[770.02s -> 776.41s]  It is none other than Mario. Is that my lawyer? Peach is my lawyer?
[784.79s -> 788.07s]  This feels fan made. Is this what the real story is?
[794.49s -> 802.28s]  This appears to be quite a predicament. Malices verifies that the island's inhabitants are indeed
[802.28s -> 810.95s]  troubled by pollution. Pollution itself is not the main problem. Mario, you witnessed this object at
[810.95s -> 817.75s]  the airstrip, correct? It is a shine sprite. Shine sprites are the source of power on Isle
[817.75s -> 824.71s]  Delphino. They used to gather in great numbers at the shine gate, but the graffiti incident
[824.71s -> 830.23s]  has polluted the island and most of the shine sprites have fled. There is no longer any power
[830.23s -> 834.95s]  to support the peaceful lifestyle of the islanders. Big Bits came in from Phylactery.
[835.91s -> 844.73s]  The only way to ensure the return of the shine sprites is to keep the island from becoming any dirtier.
[845.53s -> 853.93s]  The perpetrator is likely at work even as we speak. Mario are being treated as a criminal.
[854.89s -> 858.09s]  Tomorrow we must do our best to resolve this situation.
[869.69s -> 875.43s]  Holy shit. Uh, but Phylactery Lich gave $50. Five thousand bits. Hey,
[875.43s -> 879.75s]  Jerm, I'm glad to see you playing another cleaning game. Anybody in chat that likes to,
[879.75s -> 887.00s]  anybody in chat? And I think there's a few people in chat. Thanks for the, just for that one.
[887.00s -> 889.08s]  Thanks for the five fucking thousand bits, dude.
[896.20s -> 903.93s]  That's a lot of money. Thanks a lot, dude. Again, dude, every stream, so much money.
[904.57s -> 927.19s]  Oh, this is it. Yeah. Holy shit. Okay. Where am I going? Clean up the town.
[929.72s -> 938.04s]  Buy, uh, salsa. Whatever this is. Pepper. Salsa pepper. Hot pepper. Strawberry. Throw it. I'm
[938.04s -> 948.18s]  overwhelmed. All right. What am I doing? For you. Well, well, well. But isn't you, you have that
[948.18s -> 956.20s]  tourist map. Did I tell you to press the Z button to view that thing? This is Delfino Plaza.
[957.32s -> 970.33s]  Delfino airstrip. This is so cute. Click. Delfino Plaza. Delfino airstrip. One. Total one. Okay.
[971.29s -> 975.85s]  Can I go and zoom in? All right. Tourists get off the ferries here in Isle Delfino's largest city.
[975.85s -> 984.41s]  Attractions include the Shine Gate and Grand Pinata, Pinata, Pinata statue. Is that, wait,
[985.05s -> 996.57s]  am I, okay, I might be losing my mind. Pianta. Okay. All right, let's go. I got full water. What
[996.57s -> 1002.89s]  about Toad? Toad, anything to say? Everyone on this aisle loves to do the box breaker.
[1002.89s -> 1016.70s]  Just jump up and press L. Just mash. Why don't you give it a try? Mario. Mario. I like the way
[1016.70s -> 1042.97s]  that Flood says that. Mario. Ruin it. All right. What am I doing? Cleaning. Well, I'm pleased to
[1042.97s -> 1048.09s]  see you're safe, I must tell you. We were walking around town earlier and it seems the area near
[1048.09s -> 1054.97s]  the Shine Gate is still quite bright. Perhaps you should check it out, Master Mario. Oh, Mario,
[1054.97s -> 1059.93s]  you're okay after all. I just knew you would be. We've got our first cleaning job. First cleaning
[1059.93s -> 1068.98s]  gig. Don't hold the R button so hard. How do you do anything? And why is the sky so dark? It's not
[1068.98s -> 1075.38s]  sun-drenched. This is hardly my idea of a relaxing vacation, Mario. I'm gonna go home right now.
[1076.34s -> 1092.50s]  Oh, I can't do that. Oh, that guy was in the mud. You good? All right. Oh, you have to clean people.
[1092.50s -> 1103.03s]  What do you have to say about that? Phew, you saved me. Thanks a bunch. Don't you have to hold
[1103.03s -> 1114.44s]  it down to even, yeah, you have to aim. So water kills these guys. This is so fun, just to clean.
[1114.44s -> 1122.31s]  Do you get a bonus or anything for cleaning? Yes, I know this is another cleaning game.
[1125.35s -> 1131.19s]  Yes, okay, don't worry. We will go back to like the blood and violence and like murdering people
[1131.19s -> 1135.91s]  with Axis video games some other day. But this is like we're cleaning houses and shit this week
[1135.91s -> 1142.46s]  and the week before and the week before that and cooking and stuff. Whatever. I feel like some people
[1142.46s -> 1153.85s]  have gone missing near the Grand Pinata. I'm never gonna say that, right? Thanks, Mario.
[1154.57s -> 1166.57s]  You know what I feel like I'm playing right now? Fighting of Isaac. Of course, I don't know why.
[1167.45s -> 1185.14s]  Why am I getting that vibe? I don't know why. Can I open your mouth?
[1185.94s -> 1198.20s]  Do you want to play something else? Play the rest of the junk? There you go. This is so fun.
[1198.20s -> 1203.26s]  How did I not play this ever? How is it even possible that I didn't play this?
[1209.05s -> 1225.53s]  Spin the stick. It's Metal Mario. Oh, I already know the spoiler here. Yeah, I already know this.
[1234.98s -> 1249.99s]  Go! A kidnapping. Stop the criminal with some water. All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[1249.99s -> 1277.45s]  I'm sorry. Go! This is fighting of Isaac. Why? Why is it the same game in my brain?
[1278.49s -> 1302.55s]  Why don't I just hover? These are useless cups. You want to shoot water while moving. Oh, right.
[1304.95s -> 1316.76s]  I'm like cleaning up the whole town. All right, do it. More. Ow, ow, ow, ow. Not fair. Completely
[1316.76s -> 1326.06s]  unfair. You shouldn't be allowed to use tools like that. Sorry, I'm sure I saw that person out
[1326.06s -> 1340.06s]  on the airship. I'm positive he's responsible for all this casing. Dibs. Alert. Princess Peach of
[1340.06s -> 1350.86s]  the Mushroom Kingdom has apparently been kidnapped. Well, that's old news. The suspected kidnapper was
[1350.86s -> 1358.70s]  last seen escaping through the Eastern Fruit Market. Yeah, I mean, isn't that where I am?
[1358.78s -> 1370.87s]  Let's chase him. Well, I don't know where he is. This is the Fruit Market. He's got a negative IQ.
[1371.51s -> 1378.79s]  He went to the... What was it? Did I have to just run straight? I didn't see him. No, I was
[1378.79s -> 1384.39s]  looking... I'm so... I'm all over the place today, guys. I'm like looking at all different places.
[1384.39s -> 1388.55s]  I was looking down. I was looking at my phone. I'm like all over the place. I wasn't looking at all.
[1389.11s -> 1396.10s]  I have no idea. He's heading for the square. Go get him. I was looking at him. The camera was
[1396.10s -> 1402.06s]  pointing at him, but I wasn't looking at the camera. I was looking over somewhere else during
[1402.06s -> 1414.25s]  that cutscene. Where's my... He's not even looking. I wouldn't even look at the screen. I swear to
[1414.25s -> 1453.26s]  God. He escaped into the graffiti. Try spraying it with water. It didn't work. Oh, wait. Bianco
[1453.26s -> 1468.12s]  Hills. Episode 1. Road to the Big Windmill. Oh, yeah. It's like paintings from Mario 64, but
[1468.12s -> 1473.94s]  they're graffiti in this one. This is probably secrets, dude. There's another link.
[1474.82s -> 1489.58s]  All right, let's test the sink, by the way. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. We good?
[1489.58s -> 1498.42s]  All right, let's go. Oh, you're back again, aren't you? You seemed like you were in such a hurry last
[1498.42s -> 1510.14s]  time I saw you. It's probably like secrets and shit everywhere. Oh, wait. It's a spring.
[1514.25s -> 1525.70s]  Whoa. Hold on. It's a thing that you can walk on. I gotta get that coin. Holy shit, he found the
[1525.70s -> 1531.70s]  slide. Can I go down the slide backwards like in all the other Mario games? What do you mean he
[1531.70s -> 1547.91s]  found the slide? It's right here. Dude, he found the fucking slide, dude. This is the first thing
[1547.91s -> 1565.94s]  you see in the whole game. Dude, you found the slide. Okay, let's keep going. Do you need the
[1565.94s -> 1573.13s]  coin? Anybody? There's a trail here that connects to the big windmill. The group made it too dangerous
[1573.13s -> 1580.82s]  so the door's been closed. Might be able to get through at the water wheel up ahead. You guys evil?
[1584.76s -> 1587.64s]  Oh, just like in the original Super Mario Brothers versus game.
[1588.44s -> 1601.00s]  You knock things upside down and you can hit them. You murderer. All right, let's go. Let's go this
[1601.00s -> 1610.49s]  way. Blood all over the wall. Oh, it's dirt.
[1613.90s -> 1628.09s]  Dude, they come out of there. This game is too violent. It's good. It's good. Don't worry. All
[1628.09s -> 1637.13s]  right, what am I missing? People to talk to? Windmills are big spinning things that use wind
[1637.13s -> 1642.09s]  power. Water wheels are big spinning things that use water power. And all of them will spin faster
[1642.09s -> 1651.94s]  if you give them a good squirting. Hmm, really? What are you saying? If I go like this?
[1652.82s -> 1680.90s]  Do that from here? Got it. Oh, can I jump up on that? Plus one coin. Nice.
[1684.09s -> 1703.19s]  Oh, that was so cool. All right, let's get that one coin. Use the hover nozzle. Good.
[1703.19s -> 1713.80s]  You did it too slow. I'm on the rooftops now, though. All right, what's his name? I don't know,
[1714.04s -> 1721.42s]  Ugly Mario, whatever his name is. Ugly Mario went the other way. What's he called in this game?
[1721.42s -> 1730.55s]  Evil Mario? What's that? Amorphous Mario? What's his name? No, not Wario. The guy that's like
[1730.55s -> 1749.30s]  goo and evil. Dumb Mario. Shadow Mario. There you go. Wait, can I? Oh, look at that. Windmill? Oh,
[1749.30s -> 1764.87s]  come on. Really? There's something up there? Who got me something on here? Oh, look. Wait,
[1764.87s -> 1782.47s]  there's a big windmill. I'm going this way. Wait. Yeah. Press X. I found a big pole. Nice. Check
[1782.47s -> 1811.45s]  this out. Whoa. Oh, wow. Look at all that dirt. What's this? A super coin. You got a super coin.
[1811.45s -> 1817.78s]  Collect 10 of them. Collect 10 of them, then visit the Pope House in Delphino Plaza.
[1823.13s -> 1830.62s]  Ah, I'm going to just crack my hand. I'm ready. Let's go. Anything else up here? Wait,
[1830.62s -> 1837.24s]  there's a water mill. I fucked up. It's okay. I pressed. I tried to do something fancy. It's
[1837.24s -> 1856.95s]  all right. Let's do this. Is that not helping at all? Dude, that's so much more efficient. All
[1856.95s -> 1861.62s]  right, suck up the water. Now, does it matter that this is salt water or fresh water? Does
[1861.62s -> 1878.42s]  that matter? You don't want to use salt water on the plane. What's the average play time of this
[1878.42s -> 1889.88s]  game? Anybody know? Was it like 16, 18 hours? It's going to take me a very, very long fucking time.
[1904.50s -> 1911.27s]  I can't help it. Same reasons why I had to stop playing Luigi's Mansion. I have to do it.
[1912.15s -> 1922.17s]  Look at this. It has to... Oh. All right, let's work on this. It's got to be 100% clean. Does
[1922.17s -> 1934.30s]  this hurt you? You're never going to get this clean. Yes, I am. I'm going to get rid of the
[1934.30s -> 1962.76s]  dirty melted chocolate ball. It's all right. Teach him spin cleaning. Whoa, what did I just do?
[1965.24s -> 1979.78s]  Am I firing a gun? Is that like a cannon? I just pressed A. Is that like a... Oh, it's like a
[1979.78s -> 1993.14s]  shotgun. Got myself a moon. Wait, this is not Mario Galaxy. Not Mario Galaxy. Mario...
[1994.10s -> 2002.17s]  Mario, it's a weird wild world. No! That was all the way down.
[2003.93s -> 2022.28s]  We had a Wink. We actually had a couple. Yeah, Winks are not on sale yet. I didn't tell you the
[2022.28s -> 2031.30s]  plan. So plan for Winks are going to go as follows. At some point over the next few days,
[2032.02s -> 2037.61s]  it was streaming Mario Sunshine until I pretty much get it done. Then we got community content
[2037.69s -> 2044.97s]  night this weekend. I'm going to block off a probably 20 to 30 minute section of community
[2044.97s -> 2050.89s]  content night, whether somewhere at the front or somewhere at the end, where I go full cam
[2051.61s -> 2057.29s]  and just sit there for 30 fucking straight minutes while Winks are at least 50 to 75% off.
[2065.93s -> 2075.75s]  It's the only way that it makes any sense. You're going to fuck up your eye?
[2076.47s -> 2080.31s]  You blink every day a trillion times a day or something.
[2088.25s -> 2099.37s]  Debs alert. Isle Delfino police are investigating a possible connection between recent graffiti
[2099.37s -> 2110.33s]  incidents and the loss of contact with Bianco Hills and Rico Harbor. Right. Okay, so this is
[2110.33s -> 2115.21s]  what happens when you have your phone on airplane mode for like a day or two and you don't realize
[2115.21s -> 2119.21s]  it and you go, oh fuck, I only turned off airplane mode. You get news stories from like three days
[2119.21s -> 2133.00s]  ago. All right, I'm going back in. This is a Mario game, man. You got to do them all. Down
[2133.00s -> 2144.41s]  with Petey Piranha. Road to the big windmill and then down with Petey Piranha. Up all the way at
[2144.49s -> 2152.36s]  the top of the windmill. Looks like he's got his, he's entrenched.
[2163.66s -> 2168.14s]  All right, so how do we go from here? How do we go from here? What was that?
[2168.14s -> 2171.91s]  Can I move this log by running? No, I can't.
[2175.11s -> 2179.54s]  All right, so we got to get up there, but this is now open because we cleared it.
[2180.50s -> 2196.25s]  Okay, I'll see you in about 20 minutes. What if I, okay, so if I press them together, I'd like,
[2196.89s -> 2207.67s]  can I like spin? I'm just trying out the technique here. If I spin the analog, do I like,
[2215.72s -> 2216.76s]  spin and press R.
[2225.00s -> 2238.65s]  Whoa! All right, that kind of worked. Jump, then press R. Dude, you're getting blasted.
[2238.73s -> 2253.26s]  I'm, I'll be all right. Spin, then jump. Really?
[2260.42s -> 2272.44s]  No, that's cheating. Why's it not working? No, when you clean, okay, when you clean your room or you
[2272.44s -> 2279.32s]  clean your bathroom, you don't just hold two cans of Lysol in your hand, hold them both down aerosol
[2279.32s -> 2285.00s]  and just spin in a fucking circle and, no, you don't. You get on, you get on like your fucking
[2285.00s -> 2298.15s]  hands and knees and you spray and then you, you wipe the grunge off. Mario, danger, danger,
[2298.15s -> 2301.67s]  bridges out. Use my hover nozzle to cross the bridge. No, why would he do that when I can just
[2301.67s -> 2317.22s]  do this? What if I, I'm running out of water. He's going to ignore me. Look at all the noise.
[2318.10s -> 2326.78s]  Is there water up here? You can run while spraying. I know, but I like to, I like to
[2326.78s -> 2340.31s]  really get in there. I like to really like get in there and see. Oh, I'm out of water. I know
[2340.31s -> 2359.58s]  there's water right here, but is there any up top in the windmill? Oh, almost. All right. This is
[2359.58s -> 2377.86s]  freaking me out. I hate this. I need to clean this. I don't, I need to clean this. I thought you said
[2377.86s -> 2382.18s]  there was water up here. Is there water up here in the windmill? I don't see any water. Oh, I'm
[2382.18s -> 2406.12s]  going to die. I can't die in a Mario game in the first level. Dying to Bianco Hills.
[2408.52s -> 2414.76s]  No, I didn't. I'm preventing that, but I'd love to get this fucking other coin. All right. Wait,
[2414.76s -> 2428.60s]  hold on. Is this shit over here? I've been with these guys. Wait, what's that?
[2429.32s -> 2455.96s]  Somebody over here. How do I reliably jump out of the water? I'm getting them. All right. What's
[2455.96s -> 2474.89s]  this guy do? There's a guy over here. Get it. I can't get up there. Okay. Whatever. Sorry. Yeah.
[2475.61s -> 2480.06s]  This game is silly. Nothing there right now. All right. Let's, let's go back and do what I was
[2480.06s -> 2495.22s]  doing. It's all right. I'm getting distracted. Bring the lily pad. What in the name of fucking
[2495.22s -> 2514.22s]  God, it just happens. These spikes. Okay. Well, double jump. I didn't, I didn't even know that
[2514.22s -> 2526.28s]  it was going to happen. Let me fill this guy's veins with water. Maybe try using the hover nozzle
[2526.28s -> 2539.48s]  here. Look at what I just did. All right. Here we go. Use coins.
[2547.62s -> 2555.16s]  Shit. Um, oh, I already have a hover. I forget this is not like a regular Mario game. I can fly.
[2556.63s -> 2565.61s]  All right. Right through the middle. Could you help out with the big headed creature up there?
[2566.17s -> 2570.49s]  You're the only one we can ask to lend us a hand. I know it's a pain, but you think you can handle
[2570.49s -> 2594.07s]  it? Of course I can. Wait. The super coin. The M. Re. The M. Re. Re. Get the M. Re.
[2595.19s -> 2618.22s]  Ooh, it is right up there. All right. Boss battle incoming. Three, two, one.
[2630.02s -> 2641.21s]  Breaking. The piranha is like a baby, right? It's like a big goofy baby. That's how I see it. I'm
[2641.21s -> 2645.13s]  going to be the impression that, that, that like Petey Piranha is a big unruly baby.
[2646.97s -> 2661.32s]  Why would water hurt plant? Would it make it stronger? Thinking face. What are you doing?
[2663.16s -> 2701.37s]  He is a baby. Stomp on him. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. I'm going to fill his mouth
[2701.37s -> 2706.34s]  when he opens it. Okay. I get it. No, we don't. What is that? Is this going to be present?
[2707.30s -> 2714.71s]  All right. Open your mouth. Holy shit. This is actually what you have to do. This is horrible.
[2714.71s -> 2755.53s]  Oh, and then, and then step on his belly button. Oh, yeah. Right here. Get it. Get it. This is
[2755.53s -> 2767.22s]  that kind of fucked up again. He's actually, he's concerned to do it now. Oh, come on. Come on.
[2767.94s -> 2789.37s]  Open to rank three times. That was cool. Oh, that's like all his guts.
[2791.67s -> 2825.32s]  How many of those stars are in the game? 120. There's 120. Wow. Something's opening up here.
[2826.12s -> 2843.88s]  No, doc. Yes. Alert. This just in. The boathouse west of town has disappeared.
[2845.16s -> 2865.51s]  What do you want? Scroll faster. Let's go investigate. Mario, what's going on over here?
[2866.15s -> 2871.11s]  This darkness makes me feel gloomy and depressed. It's been this way ever since our shine sprites
[2871.11s -> 2879.45s]  went away. This is your fault and you don't even look apologetic. Something about being available.
[2894.89s -> 2936.82s]  Open. Shotgun. Oh, that was a collective. Oh, no. Fire. Screamer's ignoring the game death.
[2939.03s -> 2949.61s]  What are you talking about? Screamer ignoring game death.
[2949.61s -> 2968.44s]  That's not even. Why? It doesn't. You guys are so fucking ridiculous.
[2982.14s -> 3003.69s]  All right. Look, we have a new one. Do I want to go in there or do I? Yeah, I want to. What
[3003.69s -> 3007.69s]  happened to finishing the old one? I don't even know what you're talking about. I've never fucking
[3007.69s -> 3011.69s]  said anything like that before in my entire life. You're making shit up. I don't appreciate things
[3011.69s -> 3028.84s]  being made up about me. Cooper blooper breakout. Oh, this looks interesting. What's in there?
[3029.48s -> 3043.66s]  Does it have the tiger in there? What do you do with coins in this game? Are they like every
[3043.66s -> 3054.23s]  other Mario game besides Odyssey where it was a useless collection for no reason? Besides the
[3054.23s -> 3061.59s]  heel? Yeah. All right, Jeremy. Jeremy, what the fuck are you doing? You used to, you got like
[3061.59s -> 3066.47s]  three or four, five years ago, six years ago. You used to get like 40 kills in one life as a demo
[3066.47s -> 3074.58s]  man. But what are you doing? You can't even like pay attention. Jesus. Or one, two or three.
[3075.70s -> 3087.67s]  Wait, this is trash, right? It's like sea trash. And I know it is because it's squid and octopus.
[3088.31s -> 3114.47s]  Gross. What's this? Oh, calamari is delicious. It's got a super coin. Hey, I think you're in need
[3114.47s -> 3119.48s]  of a pair of my special sun shades. Oh, well then again, maybe you're not ready. You need to spend
[3119.48s -> 3123.80s]  a bit more time here on Isle Delfino. Come on back when you think you're ready for a pair.
[3124.92s -> 3130.98s]  Is this so I don't look directly into the sun? What's that for? All right, let's go break out the...
[3132.02s -> 3159.67s]  What's this? Do I just keep going? Where does this end up? Is there another way I can go up here?
[3161.03s -> 3176.55s]  How do I get up that? With the boxes. Luigi, help me. I'm in the sewer. How many times do
[3176.55s -> 3180.55s]  you think Luigi got a weird phone call from Mario where he had to... If people talk a lot of shit
[3180.55s -> 3184.07s]  about Luigi, I'm included. I talk shit about Luigi all the time, but he's definitely the one
[3184.07s -> 3190.55s]  that gets the phone call that's like, Luigi, I'm under some boxes in Delfino Plaza. I'm in the
[3190.55s -> 3203.94s]  sewer. And Luigi's just saying, oh my God, I'll be there in five minutes. Are these all covered?
[3204.58s -> 3219.98s]  I gotta move all these boxes. How far does this go? What the fuck? All right, move all boxes.
[3220.62s -> 3235.67s]  Wait, can I go up here? Luigi, please. Luigi, could you also bring me some cliff bars?
[3251.13s -> 3259.29s]  Mario, they don't have them at the 7-Eleven down the street. Oh, well, according to my finder store
[3259.29s -> 3265.53s]  near you, it's at the 7-Eleven, eight miles away, Luigi. Thank you. I know you'd be doing it for
[3265.53s -> 3279.74s]  your brother. These are terrible voices. Wait, you flip the gate. Can I climb up? No, it's locked.
[3285.13s -> 3302.86s]  Mario. Do Mario and Luigi live in the same house? They don't, right? That's never been cleared,
[3302.86s -> 3317.00s]  has it? Okay, they do. They do. How big is Mario's bedroom? Luigi's bedroom. Who gets the master
[3317.00s -> 3331.77s]  bedroom? Is it Mario? Where does Luigi sleep? How many rooms are in that house? It's even bunk beds.
[3332.09s -> 3348.34s]  Do they actually? Luigi has three mansions? No, Luigi got stuck in three places.
[3349.06s -> 3356.78s]  Through this gate? Okay, that's cool. That's not Luigi's mansion. That Luigi gets stuck in three
[3356.78s -> 3362.38s]  places. That's it. Wait, have I gone in there? Yeah. All right, well, what do you have to say?
[3363.10s -> 3375.00s]  Watch out, there's a fucking ghost behind you. He doesn't- he does own them, though.
[3375.00s -> 3382.09s]  Oh god, how the fuck do I know this? I played the first, like, 45 minutes of Luigi's Mansion 3.
[3383.94s -> 3385.94s]  Oh, you think the area was pointing that way on purpose?
[3386.82s -> 3412.47s]  R-r-really? Oh, that's just you being an asshole. Okay. Oh, you can climb up here.
[3414.23s -> 3423.05s]  Have we got to go- can I punch through? All right, where's the, uh, the guy- this thing that's trapped?
[3423.05s -> 3434.23s]  Over there? Back there? Where's the actual goal here? Luigi wasn't in Mario 64 because he was
[3434.23s -> 3467.16s]  trading cryptocurrencies. Okay. No! Wait, Luigi's blocking. Is that such a shortcut?
[3471.77s -> 3477.96s]  I remember when my brother and I used to play Mario 64 and he would- I was terrible.
[3478.84s -> 3482.76s]  I never got it. I was like, I can't jump on anything. I keep missing everything. Why? I
[3482.76s -> 3489.08s]  don't have timing. He's like, he's like, Jeremy, man, just use the shadows. Once you see the shadow
[3489.08s -> 3494.52s]  go over the bottom, you know you're in the right place. Thanks. Yeah. And it worked.
[3502.41s -> 3505.21s]  And then he, like, gave me a little, like, quick little- just little punch, like, hey,
[3505.21s -> 3514.70s]  man, let's- you ready for dinner? Oh, yeah. Mom's making lasagna tonight. What? No way, man.
[3515.50s -> 3518.54s]  Race you upstairs. Go, go, go, go, go! No, me first!
[3551.64s -> 3555.64s]  All right, what am I doing? I forgot. Smash this.
[3557.48s -> 3571.93s]  I have the shortcut to here. Ooh! Isaac! One up. He's going above. Can I make it from here?
[3571.93s -> 3577.77s]  Can I climb this? It was hovering me. It was hovering around me in a circle. Guys, this game
[3577.77s -> 3593.46s]  is just blinding by me. I don't know what you think we're playing. Wait. Use the hovering nozzle. I
[3593.46s -> 3598.28s]  know. It's gonna take a little bit of me getting used to. I just- I've never used it. I've just
[3598.28s -> 3601.64s]  first time I've ever played a video game. I don't know. I just- I've never even opened it. First
[3601.64s -> 3618.04s]  time ever opened. Back to what I was doing. First video is a sealed copy. It was. This was $480.
[3619.08s -> 3623.80s]  Sure, could I have bought a used one for, like, 22 bucks? But I wanted a real one. I wanted to
[3623.80s -> 3628.76s]  be able to pretend like it was me opening it the first time. So I opened up the sealed copy and
[3628.76s -> 3636.28s]  shit and pretended like I was, you know, like, hey, bro! Look what I got! No way! What is that, man?
[3637.00s -> 3643.72s]  Hey, Mario Sunshine! Oh, what? Punching the arm. Dude, me and my friends have been looking for that!
[3644.60s -> 3667.85s]  Yeah, you already play? Okay, I'll switch off every life, dude. What are you guys doing?
[3668.97s -> 3676.41s]  You want me to toss you all the way across the port? Sorry, but I don't have that kind of power
[3676.41s -> 3685.10s]  yet. Think I can throw you? I heard that you can raise the sub by spinning that thing.
[3685.82s -> 3689.02s]  How in the world are you supposed to do that? You don't happen to know, do you?
[3690.65s -> 3714.76s]  Oh, stand back, everybody. I got it. Super coin. The thing is, the trick is, it doesn't stay.
[3715.80s -> 3727.85s]  Oh, fucking Jesus. So much anxiety right now. So nervous! I'm on crack today. I'm gonna be
[3727.85s -> 3732.09s]  honest with you. I'm like, I'm like on crack right now. Like, I just, this is crack spring. I already
[3732.09s -> 3750.71s]  know it. Oh, fuck. It's gonna get me with the money. Revan! Unfollowed. No, I'm talking about
[3750.71s -> 3769.61s]  metaphorical crack. Not the real stuff. Oh, good. Hell, mom. Hey, bro, what's that? Sealed? Oh,
[3769.61s -> 3774.33s]  what is it? What's in there, man? Oh, crack. No, bro, no way. We both do it together?
[3775.53s -> 3782.95s]  I know we're in the middle of a crisis and all, but do you think you could help scrub off the walls?
[3783.51s -> 3807.13s]  You got a minute there. There's no rush. Bro punches arms. Sir, you don't understand. It's
[3807.21s -> 3834.90s]  metaphorical crack. Super coin. Dude, mom says we're having crack for dinner, bro. Punches your arm.
[3834.90s -> 3839.46s]  Dude, oh, what? No way. I'll race you up there. No, yeah, actually, I will cause I'm gonna get
[3839.46s -> 3859.51s]  that crack. There's only so much. All right. Do I grab this? Do I have to pull this out? Oh,
[3859.51s -> 3879.08s]  it just ripped its tail off. See that fucking jump? I knew it was coming.
[3879.08s -> 3895.45s]  Hand stomp. Check that out. Wait, I got, I already know what to do. Check this out.
[3899.91s -> 3908.82s]  Just rip his face off. Here we go. Ready? You stomp his hands. I got this. Squish. Come here.
[3913.05s -> 3934.82s]  Get this thing out. Oh, fuck. He's mad. Right in the face. All right, let's go.
[3934.82s -> 3966.49s]  Now I gotta pull each individual tendril off. Now pull his eyeballs out. Is this the streamer that
[3966.49s -> 3973.77s]  beats Sid the squid in under 10 minutes? Yep, welcome. Thanks for checking out the stream.
[3976.58s -> 3983.78s]  Back in like 2014, I did a, I made a video where I killed like 50 people in one life with the
[3983.78s -> 3987.78s]  Huntsman, which was, and it was on a map that was huge, like Badlands or something, which was like
[3987.78s -> 3993.40s]  almost fucking impossible to use that item. And like people talked about it for years. People
[3993.40s -> 4018.70s]  actually talked about it. I see the video pop up in threads. Gotta shine. He's googling his own name.
[4020.84s -> 4028.26s]  All right. You want, you want to be honest with you guys. You wouldn't, you wouldn't type in like
[4028.26s -> 4033.88s]  germa985. You know how many times over the last 10 years, I've been doing this for 10 years,
[4034.84s -> 4042.84s]  sometimes I'm like, oh, I'm curious. Like germa985 sucks. Germa985, bad video. Germa985,
[4043.96s -> 4049.99s]  cool. Germa985, it's like Huntsman. You know, you just, I'm like, what are people saying?
[4050.79s -> 4055.75s]  Germa985, bad YouTuber. Like, okay, what the, I want, I need to know why.
[4057.27s -> 4060.47s]  Germa985, handsome. I'll type that like three times.
[4074.58s -> 4082.76s]  No, I'm not even saying that one. Blooper surfing safari. You are your own market research team.
[4082.76s -> 4089.37s]  Yeah. I'm the only one that works for my own personal company. I don't have a market research
[4089.37s -> 4095.45s]  guy. That's me. I'm just germa985. I stream on Twitch. I don't have like a marketing team.
[4099.80s -> 4104.52s]  I, fuck, I wouldn't even looking. What would, can I like leave here and see? I want to see
[4104.52s -> 4115.75s]  that cut scene again. I was, I was not even looking at the screen again. I'll find it, whatever.
[4118.30s -> 4123.10s]  You know, there sure are some odd folks out there. Paming little bloopers is bizarre enough,
[4123.10s -> 4126.30s]  but riding on their backs. I tell you, some folks are just playing Looney.
[4127.26s -> 4147.64s]  Got it. Thank God this game is idiot proof. Wait, I have to ride a frog? That's right. I'm the big
[4147.64s -> 4152.52s]  daddy of blooper surfing. You like surfing? Hop on a blooper and give it a whirl. Oh, but one thing,
[4152.52s -> 4165.03s]  big daddy waives all liability for accidents. Now hang loose, bud. All right. Green, yellow, or pink.
[4165.03s -> 4172.81s]  Well, it's going to be a Germa985 color. That's a Germa985 color. That's a Germa985 color. That's
[4172.89s -> 4209.38s]  not a Germa985 color. Can I jump? I got it, right? That's it.
[4212.60s -> 4217.72s]  Wahoo. You want to go for a ride, bud? Go ahead and jump on the blooper you like best.
[4217.72s -> 4220.12s]  Give me some super blooper surfing and win yourself a prize.
[4222.36s -> 4235.96s]  I thought I had to jump him. I thought I had to jump him. I thought I had to jump him.
[4235.96s -> 4256.50s]  Blacks, I thought I had to jump him. Can I go faster? Yeah, if I hold, I can hold up.
[4257.46s -> 4274.86s]  All right. Now that I know that, I can do it again. It's probably just going to be under a minute,
[4274.86s -> 4282.97s]  right? Pretty weak, bud. That's not even worth talking about. Come back after you've conquered
[4282.97s -> 4306.86s]  the kiddie pool. Wait, I get sent all the way out to the, all the way out here. What? I've got,
[4306.86s -> 4310.62s]  I've got some fucking like cup surgery to do here. Hold on a second. Give me a minute.
[4311.18s -> 4319.56s]  Why did I even do this? I'm fucking, I'm stupid. Okay. I'm going to paint you a picture here. Just
[4319.56s -> 4325.24s]  think about this. Listen to what I have to say. I have a container that's like a coffee container.
[4325.80s -> 4331.40s]  So I drank all the coffee out of here. It was like half full, whatever. It was not very much.
[4332.44s -> 4337.82s]  Kim and I, Kim and I split this. So I got, I brought another little can of coffee. I like
[4337.82s -> 4342.70s]  the cans of coffee. So I was like, oh, when I'm done drinking this, I'll just refill it with the
[4342.70s -> 4348.54s]  can. Why would I open up this container to pour this into another container? Why wouldn't I just
[4348.54s -> 4357.88s]  drink it out of the can? Just drink it out of like, it's designed to be drank. Yes, there are like
[4357.88s -> 4361.96s]  cans and bottles of coffee that you can get them anywhere. You can order them on Amazon. You can
[4361.96s -> 4365.72s]  get them special loaded. You get a bit like grocery stores. Guys, you can get like cans of like cold
[4365.72s -> 4392.68s]  brew coffee. You're unique. Is there a link? Let me just double check. All right, let's do this again.
[4393.32s -> 4408.07s]  It's time to go mess it up. I don't even need to just go fast. Chain squid? No, no, no. Always
[4408.07s -> 4422.15s]  green. Pink, pink, pink, pink. Fine, I'll do pink. Oh, you want to go for a ride? Try it again.
[4424.41s -> 4434.79s]  Fine, I'll do pink. How about a different speed? That's a lie. I've never heard such a
[4434.79s -> 4494.65s]  crock of shit in my life. Somebody said press A. A jumps. Why is pink slower? Press X. Okay,
[4494.65s -> 4501.14s]  shit. Press the power button. I'm doing, I'm doing green.
[4503.78s -> 4549.98s]  Green is faster. Look at that. Green is actually faster. You're grinding that
[4549.98s -> 4565.45s]  blooper's face on the ground. No, come on. Do it. I'm sorry. I have to fucking do it like this.
[4565.45s -> 4587.03s]  It's been like this since I was a kid. Well, again. Oh, you're not a kid anymore.
[4590.92s -> 4597.24s]  Says you. I took the Toys R Us commercial. Literally. They fucked up a whole generation of us.
[4599.88s -> 4612.12s]  I'm never going to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us kid. I don't want to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us kid.
[4612.12s -> 4617.06s]  I'll always be a Toys R Us kid. And then that company got fucking liquidated and now
[4617.06s -> 4641.30s]  we're all fucked up. Thanks a lot, Toys R Us. That's why I'm okay. I'm going to move on from this.
[4642.26s -> 4649.50s]  What is this thing? This is one of my nozzles. The, oh, you cannot use it yet. It's only a hologram.
[4655.61s -> 4662.44s]  Doesn't know. It's okay, Jerma. Come to Canada. We still have Toys R Us.
[4662.92s -> 4676.65s]  That place was ridiculous. They left. Idiot. They didn't do anything.
[4678.89s -> 4683.29s]  All right. What was this thing that I'm doing here? What do we got? Anything new? Guy throws me
[4684.09s -> 4707.45s]  onto the boat. Christmas. All right. No, what are you doing, Mario? Why don't you get off? I didn't
[4707.45s -> 4716.46s]  say to get off. Wait. Anything down here? All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4718.47s -> 4720.71s]  What does that do, though? Does it slow me down?
[4720.71s -> 4738.10s]  Is that, can I hover? Why do we know? Oh, it's if I touch the top. Oh, if I, okay. If I touch the
[4738.10s -> 4745.74s]  top, I get, I'm understanding the mechanics of video games now. No, I, I, okay. Anybody else have
[4745.74s -> 4750.06s]  this problem in Mario? It's been like this since I was a kid. Since I fucking went to Toys R Us.
[4750.78s -> 4754.78s]  When you jump and you make a jump, you have to, you press A again for some reason. You're like,
[4754.78s -> 4761.67s]  here's the jump, jump. Nope. No, I didn't want to. I press it twice sometime. Like even after I land.
[4762.39s -> 4785.61s]  This is a me problem. Panic jump is great. Yeah. It's like a panic jump because I think my brain
[4785.61s -> 4789.61s]  doesn't understand that I'm going to make the jump that I just did. So it's like, wait, you
[4789.61s -> 4811.29s]  should do that again. All right. What's going to like dump on this guy? And now where are we going
[4811.29s -> 4832.65s]  to go that way? A turn. I don't fall off. Easy. Hey, hey, hey, wait till the next turn. Don't
[4832.65s -> 4841.66s]  just panic. All right. You have some brain fluid. I had half of the burrito this morning. Does that
[4841.66s -> 4861.94s]  count? It does, right? I can't believe they got rid of the punch. I was just going to call this
[4861.94s -> 4877.26s]  Mario cube. I don't know why. Mario cubed. I don't know. I can open this though. This is one of my
[4877.26s -> 4886.46s]  nozzles, the gad science hover nozzle. So how do I get it? Oh shit, this is not good. What did I just
[4886.46s -> 4902.52s]  get? What does it do? Is it just a refill? Just a refill. Oh, okay. What's your problem? Oh, you made
[4902.52s -> 4909.51s]  it all the way here. Hey, by the way, have you spoken to that guy on the roof over there? No,
[4909.51s -> 4945.61s]  I haven't. Okay, I just murdered. I guess we died all over again. I have to go from here to
[4946.73s -> 4967.24s]  can I get this? How in the world can I get up there? I don't want to do that. Stop doing that.
[4967.24s -> 4970.76s]  Stop doing the cool thing. Stop doing the cool thing. I just want to do the regular thing.
[4980.81s -> 5000.82s]  I'll get it. Wait. All right. No fucking up this time. Shit. I was too busy
[5001.38s -> 5010.14s]  looking at the guy that I killed. Turn Mario. Oh my god, Mario. You got to get a cliff bar in you,
[5010.14s -> 5020.87s]  man. By the way, I don't eat those. I'm just saying that for some reason. Any protein bar or meal
[5020.87s -> 5029.77s]  replacement bar takes me so long to eat. Please get here. It takes like 40 minutes to eat a fucking
[5029.77s -> 5047.37s]  cliff bar. They're so dense and so nutrient packed. When I take a bite of a cliff bar,
[5047.37s -> 5053.13s]  I know I'm going to be chewing that thing for at least two to three minutes. Nope. Nope. Nope. What
[5053.13s -> 5058.89s]  am I doing? Wait a minute. Oh my god. What's happening? What the fuck was that? Grab that,
[5058.89s -> 5067.29s]  Mario. What the fuck is going on? Why wouldn't he? Sorry. Everything's fine. Oh, god damn it.
[5068.09s -> 5080.38s]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what happened. I'm apparently going this way though
[5080.38s -> 5087.54s]  for some reason. Where the fuck am I? Wait. What the? Wait. I'm going backwards. This is the way
[5087.54s -> 5096.39s]  I need to go. Guys, I'm a little confused. Okay. I saw the lily pads and I had to jump on them.
[5096.39s -> 5109.42s]  I didn't do anything. I just pressed up. I was holding up. What happened? I was just holding up.
[5109.42s -> 5118.87s]  What did I do? I don't get it. What happened? I'm holding up right now. Why did I fall off?
[5119.67s -> 5135.05s]  Did I touch? Did I grab that guy's leg instead of? What happened? What happened? Holy shit. He's not
[5135.05s -> 5150.97s]  pretending. No, not on that. I mean everything else. As a streamer, let me level with you here.
[5151.85s -> 5161.91s]  Do you know how fucking horrible it would be to be sitting here and pretending to lose?
[5162.87s -> 5166.31s]  That would be so exhausting. Don't you think? That would just be
[5166.31s -> 5171.67s]  exhausting. I'm up here right now. I'm going to just jump off and be like, no.
[5172.63s -> 5196.84s]  That's exhausting. But I just did it. Listen to your brother right here. I don't need to go
[5196.84s -> 5210.09s]  from here up. Can I get up there? Hold on. Can I climb this? I'm just seeing if I can climb it.
[5211.54s -> 5221.13s]  Oh, this is tricky. Oh, shit. Okay, I gotta go that way. Oh, fuck. I don't like this place.
[5223.67s -> 5235.38s]  Slow. Slow. No need to run that fast. I'm just going to jump into that. That doesn't hit me in
[5235.38s -> 5259.69s]  the head. Oh, super coin. I gotta get that coin. I'm freaking out. Look at this too. There's three.
[5259.69s -> 5275.67s]  Look at how many coins in here. Don't fall. Manga S. Don't fall. Manga S. Okay, the goal here
[5276.71s -> 5286.92s]  is to go that way to get the coin. Slide it up. What's that? What's that thing? That's a tornado?
[5286.92s -> 5306.74s]  I don't know if that's a tornado. Okay, I didn't know that thing did. I thought it was going to
[5306.74s -> 5312.82s]  blow me up. Oh, it's exhausting. I got to pretend to get up here and fall again.
[5313.94s -> 5335.59s]  So just draining me mentally. This place is kind of weird. Oh, shit. Oh, my mic is on.
[5338.94s -> 5346.54s]  That's another thing, right? You know, like the hot mic thing. If I was sitting here live to almost
[5346.54s -> 5353.66s]  6,000 fucking people right now, why would I ever, under any circumstances, hit the mute button
[5354.62s -> 5359.66s]  and think that like, oh, now I can say literally whatever I want and my mic is turned on.
[5360.46s -> 5385.77s]  That's so bad. That what? Because you're stupid. Oh, is that why? I can still get it. All right,
[5385.77s -> 5399.03s]  I need to refill. Yep. Dude, I actually don't. I hate this part. I hate not well and stuff too.
[5399.03s -> 5404.39s]  Yeah. Hot mic. Oh, you hit the mute button and then talk a bunch of shit about everybody.
[5405.27s -> 5411.82s]  That's a good idea. Where's that button right here? Press. I mean, I'll say everything that
[5411.82s -> 5421.08s]  I've ever wanted to say bad about everything. Oh, hot mic. Oops. Almost like you should prepare
[5421.96s -> 5428.68s]  to not say anything stupid when you're hooked up with a microphone on your neck.
[5431.85s -> 5460.92s]  Don't fuck this up. Okay. What does it got? The wind guy. I'm just going to run and then run back.
[5460.92s -> 5484.65s]  This is a stupid idea. Jesus. There were just three of them. They go away. They go away. Okay,
[5484.65s -> 5489.90s]  now get that. Look at this. Two more. Look at this shit. Doesn't do your brother.
[5513.32s -> 5529.78s]  Now we walk back up. Do we? Walk back up? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I can spray
[5529.78s -> 5544.90s]  this. That means I can spray this, right? Do a backflip. How do you do a backflip in this one?
[5545.54s -> 5558.50s]  How do you do a backflip in Mario Sunshine? Can you? Is there like the same way? Left trigger.
[5560.02s -> 5572.54s]  Left trigger is his camera. This dude can do the quick jump on him. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit.
[5574.62s -> 5584.71s]  Yeah, crouch jump. That's what I mean. God damn it. I'm going to fucking die. I'm done.
[5585.43s -> 5599.42s]  Well, at least I got the points. Whatever. There is no crouch jump. Oh, that's disgusting.
[5600.86s -> 5613.67s]  This is exhausting. One of these days I want to like have like a fucking fake audio leak or
[5613.67s -> 5618.07s]  something of me. Like I'll record it through like a fucking cell. You know what I mean? Like
[5618.07s -> 5631.03s]  I'm calling somebody else. And you just have to be like, hey, yo, what's up? Hey, yo, what's up?
[5631.75s -> 5638.97s]  Yeah, I'm seeing what you're doing today. I just got done spraying and it's fucking so annoying,
[5638.97s -> 5642.81s]  dude. It was exhausting. I don't know if you have that. I'm just so sick of fucking like pretending
[5642.81s -> 5648.41s]  to fall down off shit. And I know you do it too. Like everybody does. We all do it. And I know it
[5648.41s -> 5653.05s]  brings some fucking views. But I'm just so sick of it. It's so fucking exhausting. I'm not doing
[5653.05s -> 5656.49s]  it anymore. Like I'm just going to do what I want to do on screen. But I think it's probably going
[5656.49s -> 5661.54s]  to be like painting, sculpting and shit. I'm just so fucking sick of like pretending to be bad at
[5661.54s -> 5666.42s]  video games. It's so annoying. Hey, I'll call back when you get this. By the way, this is the
[5666.42s -> 5669.54s]  fourth time with an important message. I know like maybe it's a little weird but
[5669.54s -> 5675.14s]  you haven't called back in like four days. Just you know the number. Just coming back, dude.
[5676.82s -> 5686.68s]  Chance. Okay. Bye. If you're satisfied with this message, please press one. If you'd like to
[5686.68s -> 5690.92s]  neurotically listen to everything you just said to make sure you didn't sound like a total dickhead,
[5690.92s -> 5708.15s]  press two. Thank you. Here's what she said. Please psychoanalyze every second of this
[5708.15s -> 5723.74s]  conversation you have with nothing. Count the amount of times you say uh. Was it too many?
[5724.30s -> 5750.38s]  May as well redo the whole message. Someone just said you're fucked up.
[5758.36s -> 5764.52s]  I got all the coins though. So it's worth it. Dude, you're fucked up. I got all the coins though.
[5764.52s -> 5777.53s]  So it's worth it. Okay, we're gonna follow the signs now. I got three of those coins.
[5777.53s -> 5790.68s]  I'm excited about it. Let's go talk to this guy up here. Hey, it's just like in the movies,
[5790.68s -> 5795.16s]  you know the scene where something's on the manhole and they can't get it open.
[5797.34s -> 5806.92s]  Oh, this is a shortcut. Oh, over here the whole time. That's good to know.
[5809.75s -> 5817.08s]  Get the coins. What is on? What does Android coins get you in this? An extra life? Are there
[5817.08s -> 5826.49s]  even any extra lives in this game? They're one-ups. There are. Wait, you get a shine. Wait,
[5826.49s -> 5832.94s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? Didn't I ask if coins were useless in this game and everybody
[5832.94s -> 5844.15s]  said yes? Everybody said yes. I was like, dude, are these like useless? They don't do anything.
[5869.38s -> 5875.72s]  Five guys, deception and lies. Hey, we found the guy that just turned the stream off.
[5875.72s -> 5884.60s]  Now I want a hamburger. They found him. Thanks for making the stream two hours long. Don't
[5885.46s -> 5889.62s]  say anything about delicious foods while I'm screaming. That's a rule. I'm gonna put that
[5889.62s -> 5899.51s]  in the fucking rules. Don't talk about delicious foods. Otherwise, the stream will end. What kind
[5899.51s -> 5906.97s]  of a fucking weirdo would you like what I have to actually be? We have simple rules here, you know,
[5906.97s -> 5911.93s]  no bullshit, no like toxicity. Don't be like an asshole. Don't be like a racist dickhead. Don't
[5911.93s -> 5916.33s]  like be a bigot. Like really like simple like basic shit that we could all just do. Also,
[5916.33s -> 5926.31s]  don't talk about food on my stream or you get banned in the stream ends. Oh, no, just basic,
[5926.31s -> 5933.00s]  just stuff that everyone like fucking agrees with. Okay, that was risky, but I did it.
[5933.72s -> 5953.40s]  The inverse does work though. Holy shit. What is this? You got the rocket nozzle. Power up with R
[5953.40s -> 5967.29s]  and blast off. I thought you weren't watching a vlog. Holy shit. Okay. Do I get? Oh, it's a
[5967.29s -> 5972.76s]  permanent. It's a permanent upgrade. Cool. So the red ones are permanent upgrades?
[5975.82s -> 5979.42s]  I thought I had to do that. I thought that was an indicator that you had to start. Okay,
[5979.42s -> 6002.86s]  look fine. All right. I got to, I got to move. Okay. Fuck you, man. I hate these guys. I don't
[6002.86s -> 6029.22s]  like these guys. Right into the hole. Okay. Oh shit. There it is. This is like the mousetrap
[6029.22s -> 6034.74s]  board game. It actually kind of is. Good observation. Give that guy a fucking sub somebody.
[6041.67s -> 6052.15s]  No, I will. What's his name? You do it. What's his name? Who said it? It's already gone. Who said
[6053.11s -> 6073.91s]  a liar? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. A liar. Huh? Okay. I'm a liar. It's me. What would we have? What? No,
[6073.91s -> 6076.63s]  we need to, somebody find who that was. They're going to narrow it down. What'd they say?
[6077.43s -> 6086.47s]  They said something that what'd they say? They said something. He said it was the mousetrap thing.
[6086.47s -> 6097.74s]  Yep. All right. So who should we think about the mousetrap? The secret of Rico tower. What was it?
[6101.54s -> 6107.85s]  Somebody's got it open. Who's got it? It was, dude, this is, this level is just like the
[6107.85s -> 6128.04s]  mousetrap board game. Laughing my ass off. And it was like, who was it? Okay. This level is just
[6128.04s -> 6135.78s]  like mousetrap. We got it? All right. We got it. Okay. I got it. Write that name down. How do you,
[6135.78s -> 6145.35s]  how do you give a, all right. Write that name down. I'm going to write that name down over here.
[6145.35s -> 6157.26s]  Write that name down. Where are we going now? We're going to the shortcut.
[6162.49s -> 6172.10s]  Can you imagine a Mario game that they didn't put this in? Do you think they get like annoyed
[6172.10s -> 6178.33s]  that they have to put this in every single Mario game somewhere? Did they ever think about that?
[6178.33s -> 6182.49s]  And they're like, oh, we have to, oh, wait, wait, we've done everything we've done so far.
[6182.49s -> 6188.73s]  Game's done. Oh, we have to put in the game somewhere or everyone's going to be mad.
[6194.23s -> 6196.47s]  Just throw it in here. That's it. Who cares?
[6208.26s -> 6215.82s]  It's true. I would be mad. See? Boy, that sun is bright. Yeah, I need the sunglasses. This game
[6215.82s -> 6249.16s]  sucks. Shit. Where's my microphone on? I bet you're muted to say that. Hey, what's up? Not
[6249.16s -> 6252.44s]  available. Take the call right now. Leave a message and you get a chance. See you later.
[6253.40s -> 6261.05s]  Hey, what's up, dude? I'm just calling again. I don't know if you, I guess you didn't get back
[6261.05s -> 6265.85s]  to me from my last message, but I'm really getting fucking irritated at the streaming thing.
[6266.73s -> 6270.97s]  And specifically, I don't know if you've ever played it before, but for some stupid fucking
[6270.97s -> 6278.14s]  reason, people love Mario Sunshine. It's like the worst Mario game. And I'm just playing it
[6278.14s -> 6282.30s]  just to appease everybody. Like, I don't even fucking want to play this stupid fucking game.
[6283.26s -> 6287.42s]  But I mean, I'm gonna and I have to because I started it. So if you have any tips on like how
[6287.42s -> 6292.30s]  to make it like a 60 star thing or something, you played it a while ago. Just give me a call
[6292.30s -> 6299.42s]  back whenever. Just call me whenever you feel like it. Preferably like soon. Yeah, you know
[6299.42s -> 6303.66s]  the number. Just give me a call. And then tips on how to get to like all the shines as fast as
[6303.66s -> 6332.46s]  possible. We know you don't have friends. We know you don't have. Oh, yeah. Write those names down.
[6332.46s -> 6341.74s]  They're getting subs. I'm kidding. I'm not going to do that. Where am I going? Where do I go? All
[6341.74s -> 6351.96s]  right. A liar. Yes, that was a lie. I'm not going to give like a fucking thousand subs right now.
[6352.60s -> 6359.37s]  Should I go up this? What was the goal again? Goal? The secret of Rico's power.
[6361.24s -> 6377.32s]  Over there. Wait, get that thing. Helipad. Bagby with German lies.
[6382.92s -> 6388.60s]  Holy shit, I can jump on this. Okay, that I was not. That's not a springboard. That's a valve.
[6388.60s -> 6416.65s]  That's misleading. All right, let's go. At the top of that. I punch through here.
[6418.17s -> 6423.93s]  Oh, shit. How do I? How do I punch through? How do I flip this B?
[6431.05s -> 6442.31s]  Oh, I'm going to do shit now. Change this to.
[6449.27s -> 6451.48s]  So how do I do it?
[6456.38s -> 6458.86s]  Hey, Chad, what's the best Diablo 2 character to start with? Sorceress.
[6459.82s -> 6462.50s]  Lightning Sorceress, you'll kill everything instantly. No matter what.
[6467.78s -> 6478.55s]  Okay, so we need to go over there, right? I'm going to go this way. Can I make this jump?
[6479.35s -> 6488.74s]  Should I jump from there to there? That's not the tower. What is this tower? Over there?
[6489.46s -> 6521.08s]  That's a tower. Oh, point. The game music is really loud. Is it? A little bit.
[6522.04s -> 6545.98s]  Can I change that? Another shortcut. It's perfect now. The game music is kind of quiet. Can we turn
[6545.98s -> 6564.87s]  it up? Imagine if I had a Patreon that had like a $5,000 tier where you like I like flew you out
[6564.87s -> 6571.40s]  to come like meet me like they all do. So the reason why I say that is because I was about to
[6571.40s -> 6578.20s]  just say $5,000 Patreon tier fly that guy out in like Patreon tier. Like I was making a joke about
[6578.20s -> 6581.72s]  that but I had to make that I had to tell you about that first so you know that's not real and
[6581.72s -> 6589.18s]  it's a joke. So I gotta make sure I explain that completely before I say it. Kickstarter donations
[6589.18s -> 6599.80s]  here. Yeah, that's mine. No, that's fine. I'll take the minus two because I am not going to say
[6599.80s -> 6607.64s]  that out loud. Like without giving a huge like stupid explanation for it. No way.
[6608.20s -> 6610.68s]  Okay, I like this is like our shop to give that guy a shop.
[6612.28s -> 6615.56s]  Hey, that's like a that's a that's a joke. Right. That's easy. Like
[6616.68s -> 6623.08s]  $10,000 Kickstarter tier that guy is like that's I can't even make that joke. I'm not going to
[6623.08s -> 6635.14s]  make that joke. All right, I'm gonna get to the over there. Oh, look. Well, you did. No, I didn't.
[6635.14s -> 6644.73s]  I explained what would happen if I did make the joke. Oh, pull it up. Pull it up. Mario up, up,
[6644.73s -> 6661.48s]  up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. No, no, no panic jump. Fuck. He's like a coin.
[6661.48s -> 6681.27s]  There's coin in here too. Wait, why is it what's going on? Oh, I thought that was just a I thought
[6681.27s -> 6689.77s]  oh, it's not just a refill. It switches to oh, shit. Okay. I thought it was I thought it was like
[6689.77s -> 6694.65s]  just like a oh, that makes sense. Now, it makes sense. It makes sense. I'll go get it. It's fine.
[6695.53s -> 6707.05s]  I never hit I've never even hit jump in this game until two hours ago. Come on.
[6707.93s -> 6724.89s]  All right. Gonna be fucking exhausting, man. That wasn't good enough. Gotta be like this.
[6736.38s -> 6767.51s]  I can't see. All right. Now, let's get the heck out of here. This guy sucks.
[6767.51s -> 6776.38s]  I don't even know what his brother's channel is. That's my brother. What's he up to now?
[6776.38s -> 6779.34s]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, whoa, we got a big we got a big group of people coming in.
[6780.71s -> 6785.03s]  Hey, what's going on, guys? What's up? What's Jeremy up to? Oh, he can't jump.
[6785.03s -> 6789.51s]  Oh, I'll handle this. Oh, shoot. Comes in. He's like, hey, punches. Hey, dude. Hey, hey,
[6789.51s -> 6794.12s]  let me get the give me the controller for a second. Right, guys? All right. All right, bro.
[6794.12s -> 6799.48s]  Hey, take it, man. He does a first try. Hey, just like pats me in the back like yeah, there you go,
[6799.48s -> 6810.38s]  buddy. Hey, raid my channel. And I'm like, yeah. I earned this. And that's like the last thing he
[6810.38s -> 6828.25s]  hears if I scream and he closes the door. All right. I got it again. Now, just it's simple.
[6828.25s -> 6865.54s]  You just have to jump like this. Simple. Wicked easy. It's wicked easy. Oh, come on. I don't have
[6865.54s -> 6892.38s]  much water. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Where? What do I do from here? Like, okay. You know, like the
[6892.38s -> 6897.82s]  oh, he says this is a neighborhood. Slow down, dickhead. Right. I'm not going to hear you.
[6898.78s -> 6903.70s]  You even if you scream at a car that's like going by, they're going to hear you scream.
[6904.98s -> 6917.08s]  This is what they're going to hear. That's it. Not even it'll be like. All right. What do I go
[6917.08s -> 6928.58s]  from here? I'm on the tower. Yeah. So now what? Smash it. Throw in the hole. Oh, the I see what
[6928.58s -> 6945.61s]  you're saying. I don't have enough water to do this part. Sorry, just should I do it with oil?
[6946.25s -> 6963.32s]  Oh, my God. Don't drink the oil, Mario. All right. All right. I got to focus. No,
[6963.32s -> 6968.20s]  no more fucking around with people speeding by my house, driving as fast as they fucking can
[6968.20s -> 6999.35s]  dangerously. What an asshole. But like, all right, let's keep going. It's actually kind of hard.
[7000.15s -> 7005.29s]  It's actually kind of hard. By the way, I haven't played it. Listen, listen, everyone. Relax,
[7005.29s -> 7008.73s]  relax, relax. I know I'm going to freak the fuck out right now, but you have to remember something
[7008.73s -> 7014.81s]  very important before everyone starts throwing rocks at me. Listen, I haven't played a fucking
[7014.81s -> 7029.32s]  Mario game in 15 years. At least I'm telling you the truth. What is this? Oh, this looks easy.
[7030.04s -> 7033.77s]  You got the Rugrats remix.
[7048.94s -> 7051.10s]  Where's the biehue? Where's the biehue? There's no biehue in this one.
[7051.26s -> 7076.01s]  Holy shit in my fucking diaper.
[7102.66s -> 7109.08s]  We're going to be here a while, I think. Can I just walk over it? No, that's a bad idea.
[7139.00s -> 7170.18s]  You fucking gotta be kidding me. What? How did I miss that? What? Well, that was just so off,
[7170.18s -> 7178.90s]  apparently. The shadow didn't show up. Listen to your fucking mother. God damn it. Itchy fucking
[7178.90s -> 7192.70s]  whole body. My whole body's itching. All right, I'm good. I'm sad that there's no biehue. I would
[7192.70s -> 7203.96s]  be so much better with the biehue. Thankfully, I can do this as many times as I possibly can do.
[7204.68s -> 7232.46s]  Yeah, I can do this an infinite amount of time. That's a lot of greed right there. My god.
[7236.33s -> 7253.70s]  Oh my god. Oh, shit. That gets hard at the end. Jumping diagonally over there,
[7253.70s -> 7270.06s]  that gets a little tricky. Okay, let's go. Real voice. Real voice. Oh my god. Excuse me. I mean,
[7270.06s -> 7278.46s]  hey, what's going on, everybody? I'm a black intruder. Hey. Oh, dear. Oh, boy. Oh, crap.
[7284.55s -> 7289.91s]  Wait, they move. They move. That's what's going on. That's the problem. I figured it out. They move.
[7289.99s -> 7302.54s]  They're moving. Oh, shit. They're moving back and forth, not just spinning. Oh my goodness. Oh, man.
[7303.42s -> 7308.06s]  I have to try a new strategy this time. You know what? Let me tell you. I'm fucking exhausted.
[7310.70s -> 7317.10s]  Hey, this is the last message I'm gonna leave, but I'm not exhausted right now. I'm so tired.
[7317.10s -> 7318.70s]  I'm just pretending every day.
[7345.67s -> 7352.55s]  He just dropped on his own. Shit. I'm telling you, he dropped on his own. Something going on with
[7352.55s -> 7358.23s]  like the way the game's emulated on the fucking GameCube 2 Wii. I swear to god. I'm not even mad.
[7358.23s -> 7364.55s]  This is fun. This is what happens when you play Mario. Okay, I didn't want to do the weird jump.
[7364.55s -> 7373.10s]  Okay, let's just settle down a little bit and like... This is original hardware.
[7376.15s -> 7379.99s]  I'm not even angry tilted. I'm like comedy tilted. I'm... This is funny.
[7380.71s -> 7383.35s]  It's making me... This is making me laugh, not even making me mad.
[7396.66s -> 7399.30s]  All right, if I don't get it right now, then I am gonna give
[7399.70s -> 7408.02s]  $40 or $50 towards when me and my friend go to get lunch at that new lunch spot. Like, I'll pay.
[7423.02s -> 7433.37s]  Bad greed, but it's all right. Oh my god, I fucked it up. It's okay. No, I didn't. I'm good.
[7433.37s -> 7455.46s]  Calm down. Right out. Relax. Oh my god, it's gonna make me fucking puke.
[7456.90s -> 7471.19s]  It's gonna make me fucking puke. Where do I go from here? Over? Where? Over there?
[7471.91s -> 7500.15s]  That seems so far away. That almost was really bad. Dude, you styled into it.
[7500.15s -> 7516.52s]  Friend pays for lunch. Oh, nice. Hey, he's not even watching. Hey dude, yeah, you want to check out
[7516.52s -> 7522.62s]  that new lunch spot? Yeah, yeah, we're gonna check that out. Oh, oh my god, that was delicious. Yeah,
[7522.62s -> 7528.50s]  thanks for paying. Wait, what? You weren't watching? I beat that like secret level in
[7529.30s -> 7536.90s]  Mario Sunshine and I bet that you would be paying, but you bet. Well, that's fucking hilarious, dude,
[7537.86s -> 7553.19s]  but you took me here. I'm going back here. Dude, what do you mean dude? This one is the hillside
[7553.19s -> 7561.86s]  cave secret. This is another secret level, but Larry, finish the joke. There is no finish the
[7561.86s -> 7570.92s]  joke. What are you talking about? The joke is that was a prequel to me calling him five times and
[7570.92s -> 7586.06s]  leaving voice messages. What's the punch line? What punch line? It wasn't a joke, was it? I don't
[7586.06s -> 7595.42s]  remember. Was I making a joke? Not really. Finally. Oh, I got to hear it. It's been, come on. That's
[7595.42s -> 7606.46s]  what I was looking for. It's in the game. It's just recycled audio. There it is. Yeah. All right,
[7606.46s -> 7615.91s]  so now we want to go. What's over there? Make a joke or I'm gonna unsub. Write that guy's name
[7615.91s -> 7621.98s]  down. He's not, he's not, you think you're going to unsub? Oh, that's funny. Not on my watch. I'll
[7621.98s -> 7638.28s]  make sure you stay subbed. What's that guy's name? Write that name down. I subbed that guy forever.
[7638.28s -> 7655.93s]  Like I do. So he can't unsub. Should I do the thing? What is it? It's not really that big of a
[7655.93s -> 7671.54s]  deal. I mean, I just murdered that motherfucker. Yeah, that's how you do this. All right.
[7673.38s -> 7704.98s]  Is that it? How am I not hitting these? Don't jump? Oh shit. I thought you had something.
[7706.74s -> 7728.34s]  Give us a wink. I got it. You're going the right way, right? Always listen to your brother. Watch
[7728.34s -> 7732.42s]  the shadow. Don't even watch anything else where you're going. Just watch the shadow. So this is
[7732.42s -> 7748.89s]  not even correct. Can I still get that from here if I do a big one? Don't jump! That panic jumped
[7748.89s -> 7753.67s]  again. See? Everybody knows. Everybody knows what I'm talking about. I was there and I was like,
[7753.67s -> 7763.50s]  no, I'm not there. I'm not there. Why does he always stare at the camera with an angry face?
[7786.60s -> 7807.50s]  Hey, I'm actually, I'm, I have a criticism of this game. Where's the Yahoo? They took it out.
[7807.50s -> 7815.18s]  That's like the most favorite move ever. Do something funny or I'm un-VIPing. Nope.
[7816.06s -> 7825.11s]  I make the VIP look. You don't go to like an exclusive club and say to the bouncer,
[7825.11s -> 7834.54s]  hey, I'm VIP, but take me off the VIP list. Nope. Okay. The game is out to get me. The
[7834.54s -> 7845.59s]  bouncer is going to be like, what the fuck are you doing? All right. Here we go. There's another
[7845.59s -> 7856.71s]  secret level. Oh no. It's one of these. They're all like this, huh? Holy shit. This looks horrible.
[7856.71s -> 7872.18s]  Actually, this doesn't even look that bad. First try. Where is he? Where is he? Okay.
[7872.90s -> 7881.40s]  Oh, this ain't even that bad. It's just weird. Okay. It is kind of bad. Was I going under? I
[7881.40s -> 7920.47s]  thought I was going under. That wasn't bad at all. You can make that one harder if you try to jump
[7920.47s -> 7924.31s]  on the top of the things. The other one was way more difficult, probably because it's a harder
[7924.31s -> 7931.05s]  level. Didn't get the one up yet. That's less important than redoing the mission like three
[7931.05s -> 7950.90s]  times. That was like level one or two. So is that it? Are there three per stage? Is it three, four,
[7950.90s -> 7965.69s]  five? Oh, red coins of windmill village. Eight. Oh man. Eight shines. You need to do the first
[7965.69s -> 7987.93s]  seven. I see. Oh, here's the red coin. They stole this from Yoshi's Island. All right. Where they at?
[7987.93s -> 7995.06s]  One, two, three, four. Self plagiarism. Oh, isn't it right there? Any back here?
[7996.02s -> 8005.67s]  They stole Mario from Yoshi's Island. See, you get it. Only more people could get it like you.
[8006.39s -> 8028.14s]  Sub them. Wait, they're not subbed? Pardon, no. What just happened? What's happened to me?
[8028.14s -> 8053.34s]  I'm, oh, I went in looking for this one. Uh, one over, I don't see any. Checking the perimeter.
[8053.34s -> 8072.31s]  How about this way? I see one over there. I've never even been over here. What is over here?
[8072.31s -> 8102.38s]  Oh, there's a red coin over there. Oh, okay. Oh, it's a blue coin. Two blue coins. Okay,
[8102.38s -> 8109.77s]  there's another one right here. Go grandpa, go. Go grandpa, go. Two blue coins? Holy shit.
[8110.65s -> 8122.82s]  How many is that? Make it two, 12, 15 coins. I think I need, I need 16 coins and then I can move on
[8122.82s -> 8145.43s]  from here. I'm not getting it. Finally. There's the money. There's the money. There's the money.
[8146.95s -> 8151.67s]  Five community subs just came in from Radist Raccoon. Do we also have a ton more money
[8151.67s -> 8158.79s]  somewhere? Am I making that up? I made it up. Uh, thanks Radist Raccoon for the five community subs.
[8158.79s -> 8164.10s]  Welcome guys. We gotta, uh, hope you got one. I think I can think much better when I'm alone.
[8164.10s -> 8167.78s]  I used to go to the hillside cave for a good think. Now it's just too scary.
[8169.21s -> 8172.41s]  Well, if you had gone in there, you would have got the fucking thing that's worth like
[8172.41s -> 8177.77s]  at least 80,000 United States dollars. One of those shines, but I got it. It's mine.
[8178.97s -> 8179.69s]  Oh, that's cool.
[8195.05s -> 8200.50s]  All right. First impressions of Mario Sunshine. You ready? I'll give you my first impression.
[8201.06s -> 8216.36s]  All right. It's been almost two and a half hours. Okay. Um, it was horrible. Okay. This is horrible.
[8216.36s -> 8222.68s]  This is, uh, it's, it's very good. It's very good.
[8222.68s -> 8255.56s]  I, we'll see. We'll see. I need three more red coins. We'll see. I played,
[8256.36s -> 8259.40s]  I played Mario Galaxy when it came out and it was like, wow, this is
[8260.20s -> 8282.79s]  that's the last Mario game that I actually like played all the way through. So it's going to be
[8282.79s -> 8289.98s]  a question whether or not I think this is better than Mario Galaxy. It's going to take a little
[8289.98s -> 8308.17s]  while. It is, it's not, it's not. Well, that's for me to decide. Remember what I say becomes a
[8308.17s -> 8322.89s]  fact. That's how it works. Holy shit. I don't know you could do that. Wait, where did that even go?
[8323.77s -> 8331.99s]  And remember, you have to have, you have to think one's better than the other.
[8332.71s -> 8336.89s]  There is no like, Oh, I just like video games. I like them both. No, no, no, no, no. You have
[8336.89s -> 8348.47s]  to say this one's better than that one. Where'd that other coin go? That blue,
[8348.47s -> 8368.36s]  where'd that blue coin come out from? What is it? Oh, I got to ring those bells. Give me that water.
[8368.36s -> 8402.58s]  Oh, you're going to find the X. Okay. You can't, you can't just like them all. You're a centrist.
[8406.22s -> 8416.02s]  That doesn't make any sense because they're all Mario games. No, a true centrist position would
[8416.02s -> 8420.82s]  say that I think Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog games are equally as good and there's not one
[8420.82s -> 8440.12s]  better than the other. That's me being, that's a centrist. They're both all Mario games. Where
[8440.12s -> 8450.20s]  are these last two coins? I got to go home. I need to get a good view. How do you, how do you
[8450.20s -> 8459.88s]  switch to camera mode? Where's camera mode? I just, I had it before. How do I do it? Why? Okay.
[8460.84s -> 8474.79s]  Well, there's not one over here. I'm going to go that way. I guess.
[8478.87s -> 8481.66s]  Hmm. What about over here? Anything over here?
[8488.20s -> 8505.67s]  Oh, I thought those were bananas. All in that village. Oh, shit.
[8515.14s -> 8519.69s]  This is the X, but where's the, oh, this is the X. Okay. Let's get it.
[8530.26s -> 8539.61s]  Now it goes that side. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sure. I mean, I think it's bullshit,
[8539.61s -> 8563.53s]  but whatever. Yeah. Get in there too slow. Yeah. Just do it again. Just do it again. These guys
[8563.53s -> 8570.47s]  were just pissing me off. You guys are just pissing me off. You got to go up around quickly.
[8570.47s -> 8593.22s]  It's just being annoying. Fucking Binding of Isaac. $50. We had, oh, we had, we had some big
[8593.22s -> 8599.78s]  bits and then we had five community subs. Back to back right there. Five subs. Thanks for five subs.
[8600.50s -> 8616.63s]  From Jerma sucks. Thank you. And then we also had 5,000 bits. 5,000 bits from Super Guppy.
[8617.67s -> 8621.05s]  Thank you. Super Guppy for the $50 fucking dollars.
[8623.86s -> 8628.10s]  And your message says, Hey, Jerma, it's been a while since I donated. Just want to tell you
[8628.10s -> 8631.78s]  that how much I appreciate everything you do. And I'm going to be missing these streams while I'm
[8631.78s -> 8637.22s]  deployed. I was wondering if you had any plans to play the battle for Bikini Bottom
[8637.22s -> 8640.50s]  rehydrated whenever that comes out. Yeah. They're remaking this shit, aren't they?
[8642.04s -> 8650.95s]  Yes, definitely. What is it going to be on? What is that? What platform is that going to be on?
[8650.95s -> 8661.00s]  Everything. Just everything. Okay. If I could do it on PC. Yeah, I'll definitely play it. Is it
[8661.00s -> 8666.49s]  going to be on stream? Yeah. Why not? If not, that's cool. Well, we're definitely doing it.
[8667.05s -> 8671.53s]  I was going to get it for the old consoles, but why would I do that when I can play the new one?
[8672.87s -> 8676.47s]  I appreciate everything you do and all the laughs you've given my girlfriend and I
[8676.47s -> 8680.31s]  from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for being you hands down the best streamer and
[8680.31s -> 8689.64s]  the only one I watch. It means a fucking lot. I wish you the best of luck. Good luck with
[8689.64s -> 8695.75s]  your deployment. Thank you so much for watching. And that means a fucking lot. That's a, that's a
[8695.75s -> 8712.57s]  really, really nice fucking thing to say. Thanks for the $50 dude. You're the only streamer I've
[8712.57s -> 8721.05s]  watched. That's, well, that's, well, that's really, that's good because like if you, if you watch
[8721.05s -> 8725.37s]  anybody else, you'll see how shitty this stream actually is. Don't watch anybody else ever. Don't
[8725.37s -> 8735.08s]  ever click on another stream because then you'll see how bad these streams are. I'm kidding. This,
[8735.08s -> 8739.22s]  we've got the best of the business here. You know what? You don't, I got to give myself a little
[8739.22s -> 8751.48s]  bit of credit where it's due. This is the best in the business right here. Where's this last coin?
[8752.36s -> 8759.21s]  Ego maniac. Oh yeah. Ego maniac. I'll be leaving a voicemail on one of my friend's fucking phones
[8759.21s -> 8768.54s]  later about that one. You better believe it. Oh, I'm almost out of water, but I don't need that.
[8775.29s -> 8796.66s]  Get there. Oh, I got to get that coin. I don't even know what the hell these things do.
[8797.88s -> 8803.16s]  I have no idea what these do. All I know is that I want them. I don't even know they do.
[8803.16s -> 8807.24s]  They're just blue and that's enough of it.
[8810.78s -> 8833.88s]  Hold on. What? Well, isn't that interesting? Cool. All right. I see a blue coin over there.
[8838.47s -> 8846.12s]  I don't even need that. Let's do it from here. And there's a last red coin. Oh, isn't that cute?
[8846.12s -> 8851.96s]  But it's wrong. I know what that is. Red and Stimpy. Get back. Write that person's name down.
[8852.84s -> 8869.29s]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Two stupid dogs. Yeah. Sorry. That's incorrect. Well, it wasn't that cute,
[8869.29s -> 8889.08s]  but it was wrong. It was. Fucking idiot. Stupid. Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot. Fucking dumb.
[8889.08s -> 8896.06s]  That's fucking idiot. Yeah, I know. I deserve that. I want that. How do I get that from here?
[8896.06s -> 8910.20s]  I need a super spring. I don't think I can get it from here. No, I can't get it from here.
[8911.08s -> 8920.25s]  Get the stuff. Up. Go up, Mario. Come on. Go up and get the stuff.
[8937.08s -> 8942.28s]  I fucking knew that was going to happen, too. Like, I could see it from a mile away. I just...
[8943.64s -> 8950.17s]  I'm going to run out of water. He sucks. Stop saying that. Don't fucking say that.
[8954.38s -> 8959.85s]  He sucks. He sucks. He sucks. He sucks. He sucks. He sucks. He sucks. Don't fucking say that fucking
[8959.85s -> 8971.67s]  thing. Don't fucking say that anymore. All right. I have to focus. I'm not focusing. That's the
[8971.67s -> 8999.48s]  problem. What happened there, Mario64? Wannabe. He does hate this game. No, actually, I don't.
[8999.48s -> 9010.07s]  I actually really like it. I enjoy the streamer. Is he a cool dude? Up to you. Make that decision.
[9010.07s -> 9015.83s]  I can't make it for you. Tag me when he lies. Tag me when he lies. Why? What did I do?
[9016.63s -> 9025.13s]  Why? I don't get it. All right. I'm going to... Let's check this thing out.
[9026.25s -> 9045.11s]  Petey Piranha strikes back. What does this mean? Petey Piranha strikes back. He's all the way over
[9045.11s -> 9061.82s]  here on a little island. This one is awful. Why? Let's take a look. This one sucks.
[9065.26s -> 9071.03s]  Okay. Well, let's find out why.
[9074.55s -> 9087.59s]  We're here. Other side.
[9092.89s -> 9099.99s]  Let's lurk the chocolate off the ground. Yeah, I just think of Willy Wonka whenever I see this
[9099.99s -> 9130.25s]  stuff. Where is he? Get a good view. Oh, God. That's not how you work that, Mario. How many
[9130.25s -> 9136.26s]  times do you guys have a car door to yourself in your face? Raise your fucking hand. Raise your
[9136.26s -> 9142.42s]  hand. I know. I've done it a bunch of times. How many times have you closed your car door
[9142.42s -> 9147.38s]  and it hits you right in the chin? It's happened at least once or twice to all of you. I know it
[9147.38s -> 9163.64s]  hasn't. It looks like we've got a lot of liars in here. Tag that person when chat lies. Where is he?
[9164.36s -> 9178.31s]  Embarrassing. So you're telling me that you've never had like a bag of groceries in your hands
[9178.87s -> 9184.31s]  or and like you closed your car door with your hip and you like scraped the top of your head
[9184.31s -> 9190.55s]  with the door somehow or like the bottom of the door. You've never done that before. Not even one
[9190.55s -> 9204.70s]  time. This doesn't happen every day. It's happened every once like maybe three times in my whole life
[9205.34s -> 9211.38s]  but it's definitely happened more than once. How do you do that? Because you're like you use your
[9211.38s -> 9216.18s]  like arm elbow and like hip and you like go too hard you've been you hit the back of your head
[9216.18s -> 9223.50s]  or the top of your head. It happens. Or like your chin or your neck. Not the top of your head. No,
[9223.50s -> 9231.24s]  I know where this is going and I'm gonna stop it right now. I'm talking to... Where's Petey Piranha
[9231.24s -> 9280.50s]  too? There? I'm gonna get the rocket. Can I get the rocket for this? Clown car door. Mario. All right,
[9280.50s -> 9289.56s]  this is that's too strong. Dude, that's fucking lie. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, I can even
[9289.56s -> 9318.95s]  fucking do that. Your brother coming in and doing it for you. I have no idea where he is. You saw it
[9318.95s -> 9334.31s]  before? Yeah, but I'm going right away. I'm going up there. We're just going. We're just done.
[9339.05s -> 9342.86s]  What am I? How am I dumping my pants? What am I doing?
[9343.66s -> 9372.55s]  Oh, let's see. Let's go up here.
[9377.96s -> 9400.81s]  Camera. No. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way.
[9400.81s -> 9410.89s]  Wrong way. Pleat. Pleat wrong side of the map. What's this? What do you want?
[9410.89s -> 9423.37s]  I saw it. It's that big hit of thing from the big windmill. It's back. How do you see this and not me?
[9425.80s -> 9437.53s]  Wrong way. Complete wrong way. So I have to go this way? Just go to the sludge. Wrong way.
[9437.53s -> 9466.49s]  Wrong way. All right, here's the sludge. Wrong. Wrong? It's not over there. Is it over here?
[9469.24s -> 9479.69s]  Wrong. Wrong. Somebody tell this guy's going the wrong way. Go to the cliff. Wrong.
[9481.77s -> 9495.14s]  He's on the cliff. I mean, it was surrounded by cliffs. Up there? Is he up there? Is he up there?
[9495.94s -> 9510.60s]  He's up there? Is he up there? Wrong. Wrong way. Yes. Yeah. I thought it was like down. All right.
[9510.60s -> 9527.37s]  All right. Is he up there? Okay. Oh, well, come on. I zoomed out. I didn't know we were over there.
[9527.37s -> 9543.11s]  All right. Now what do I do? Big arc. I'm just jumping on his head.
[9543.99s -> 9577.45s]  Well, I know where it is. Let's go. You think when Mario falls out like that and all the toads are
[9577.45s -> 9581.67s]  over there, you think he's just like shakes it off? I think he's just like, don't fucking look at me,
[9581.67s -> 9587.72s]  man. Did they know that I failed? Like if I fall back out of that like painting on my back,
[9588.28s -> 9591.16s]  isn't it like, holy shit, is he all right? Should we like talk to him?
[9591.80s -> 9597.58s]  Or is it just like, don't fucking talk to me. I'm going back in. Don't even look over here.
[9599.37s -> 9607.16s]  I wonder if it's like that. If it happens like three or four times on the road,
[9607.16s -> 9609.72s]  you think that one of the toads eventually would be like, Mario, do you need some help?
[9611.45s -> 9627.29s]  Mario, do you want, do you even bring it up? We found the slide. All right. Well, I need the
[9627.29s -> 9646.76s]  rocket again. We found the slide. Play wow. Did somebody just write play wow in this? What?
[9647.40s -> 9656.41s]  How would I do that? Ever again. Mario, are you all right? This thing doesn't even work. Malfunction.
[9656.81s -> 9679.22s]  Okay. I remember. Okay. So of those 6,000 people that are here right now,
[9679.22s -> 9698.49s]  how many of you were around for the Kara's an era? Hey, these guys are just dying.
[9705.38s -> 9741.74s]  All right. He's coming over here. He's coming over here. Oh, where's he going?
[9742.70s -> 9778.42s]  Pick his ass. Why is he just flying around? Shoot him with the. Where is he?
[9779.38s -> 9804.31s]  He's supposed to like go terrorize the town. Why do I get more? I need more pigs to fire. Don't I?
[9805.43s -> 9814.34s]  Oh shit. He's on the ground. Oh, what the fuck?
[9815.86s -> 9831.91s]  You're on the ground permanently. Oh, I got hit by the pig.
[9838.49s -> 9846.57s]  All right. Watch out. Get out of the way. If I can just spray him. I don't need a pig.
[9854.73s -> 9871.42s]  Oh shit. Spray him. Spray him. Spray him. Spray him. Where the fuck is this guy? Wrong way. Wrong
[9871.42s -> 9891.37s]  way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. That's right. Blank it wrong. Give me
[9891.37s -> 9900.17s]  the controller. Fuck. Take it. Jesus. Take it. You're doing pretty good. All right. Cool. So you're
[9900.17s -> 9911.85s]  following his shadow and just aiming straight up. Okay. You missed. You fucking missed. I have to
[9911.85s -> 9923.96s]  chase him. Why did you step in the mud? Oh, did you switch? Well, you accidentally switched
[9923.96s -> 9944.28s]  to the other one. Why'd you do that? Why are you so bad at this? Have you not hit him yet? Finally.
[9944.28s -> 9995.80s]  Jesus. Open. Open. Open. Open. Open. Open. Open. Open. Three. Where's the star? Hey, can I have
[9995.80s -> 10002.98s]  the controller back now? Okay. No, no. I give it back. Give me the controller. Just give it to me,
[10002.98s -> 10012.52s]  dude. Right here. Let go. Let fucking go of the... Just let it go. I want... Let me play. Let it go.
[10013.78s -> 10020.98s]  Let it... Fuck. Come on, dude. Don't... Fine. Fine. Fine. All right. I'm done. I'll just be like...
[10021.70s -> 10048.14s]  I'll just get it. Fucking idiot. Your dad's never let you guard down. I got it. Big bro never let
[10048.14s -> 10055.10s]  you play. Don't you guys understand the little brother, big brother strategy?
[10057.02s -> 10061.50s]  Oh, hey. You can play for an hour and a half straight, big brother. I'm the little brother.
[10062.54s -> 10070.92s]  Oh. Can I play? Okay. After the next level. Oh, okay. Do you want something to drink?
[10072.09s -> 10080.28s]  Yeah. Actually, grab me a Coke. Sure thing, brother. Get a Coke. Put it down right there.
[10080.28s -> 10090.44s]  There it is. And that takes two hands. One, two, open tab. The controller is yours. Hey! What the...
[10102.34s -> 10108.01s]  Or just mention going to the bathroom. You know, just make it like really obvious that you just
[10108.01s -> 10112.65s]  were in the bathroom. And when people start to think about them being in a bathroom, like, oh,
[10112.65s -> 10117.77s]  like, yeah, sorry. I'll be right back. I'm going to go take a piss. A piss. Pee. You're going to pee.
[10117.77s -> 10121.45s]  I pee. I have to pee. Pee. Pee is in my body. Pee is in all of our bodies. My kidney produces it
[10121.45s -> 10127.77s]  and makes it in my blood. I have to pee. I pee. I have to pee now. And then you come back like,
[10127.77s -> 10134.57s]  yeah, yeah, I was back. I just took a big piss. Oh, yeah, yeah. You'll get the controller. Oh,
[10134.57s -> 10148.79s]  fuck. I should do that too. The secret of the dirty lake. I'm just doing all Bianco Hills.
[10149.75s -> 10170.70s]  I didn't even look. Fucking come on. That was proof that I didn't even look at the screen.
[10170.70s -> 10183.70s]  You know what I mean? I don't even know where to go. I know there's a dirty lake here.
[10184.26s -> 10188.41s]  Secret of the dirty lake. This doesn't look very dirty to me.
[10196.18s -> 10221.91s]  Call me when he gets to the Tinko level. This is a dirty lake. This looks like a dirty lake. This
[10221.91s -> 10234.28s]  water is absolutely less clean than the last one. Thank you. Giant arrow signs. This is a dirty lake.
[10234.28s -> 10254.70s]  Wait, this one, someone's fucking with me. This sign's pointing back now. It was this lake.
[10261.59s -> 10294.01s]  Oh, I want that bling. Holy, I have 25 of these blue coins. I thought I had three.
[10296.01s -> 10302.71s]  Wait, why am I getting hurt by the water? Is it too dirty?
[10308.73s -> 10343.35s]  It's dirty. I gotta clean this water. Just drink it all. What am I doing? What am I doing?
[10343.35s -> 10362.36s]  I'm trying to jump on this fucking guy. I'm dead. I was trying to jump on the guy's head.
[10362.36s -> 10365.96s]  I wasn't even looking. There's a wink came in, so I gotta get it. I wasn't looking.
[10371.58s -> 10375.66s]  I'm getting out of here. I have zero lives. What happens when you get to zero?
[10377.02s -> 10395.29s]  Nothing, right? It's a Mario game. What's this for? I don't know. I'll take them.
[10395.93s -> 10423.94s]  Holy shit, that launches you really high. Hold on. Do it again. All right. What do I want to do? Do I want to go clear that thing?
[10423.94s -> 10431.26s]  Or do I want to just go back to the other levels? Or what do I want to do? Let's see. What do I feel like doing?
[10431.90s -> 10448.33s]  Can I eat? Can you eat these? Let's go back here. I think I only did like one thing here.
[10449.05s -> 10475.42s]  Rico Harper. Gooper blooper returns. Do another race. Oh no, this is the other one. This is this
[10475.42s -> 10484.26s]  thing. Okay. All right. Gooper blooper. I thought you guys said this guy's name was Sid the squid.
[10487.10s -> 10499.29s]  This is bullshit. His name is Gooper blooper. What do you mean no one said that? Why would I have said
[10499.29s -> 10508.25s]  that for no reason? I wouldn't just randomly make up the guy's name. Sid the squid. You made it up.
[10515.00s -> 10524.97s]  I didn't make it up. I didn't make that up. No, I didn't. I did not make that up. Somebody else did.
[10525.69s -> 10534.60s]  All right. There's Sid the squid. Is this part two? Is this another fight?
[10535.56s -> 10543.19s]  That was the easiest one. Should I get the rocket? Probably the rocket, right?
[10544.23s -> 10554.26s]  I guess not. I can just get up from here. There's a jump right there and now I know it's a fucking jump.
[10555.06s -> 10560.12s]  All right, here we go.
[10560.12s -> 10588.89s]  You must find a way to fight it. This is the way to fight them. Rip his face off.
[10590.65s -> 10615.51s]  Kidding me? Are you kidding me? Oh no, phew. Easiest boss in the game. I'm about to win right now.
[10620.68s -> 10640.44s]  Oh, you got to get off. You know how many old game facts reds about this guy exist?
[10641.40s -> 10665.94s]  What? I'm having trouble. I can't beat the squid. I don't understand. I pulled the cork out and I'm
[10665.94s -> 10679.70s]  spraying him. I don't know what to do. Messed up keyboard typing response. The person's definitely
[10679.70s -> 10703.59s]  like 13 and that person knows everything. And it's funny because I do that shit all the time still.
[10703.59s -> 10706.71s]  I actually write like that still. If you have a part of the pre-stream chats,
[10707.35s -> 10717.46s]  you know that I do that all the time. I mess up half the words I type on a keyboard. I do
[10717.46s -> 10722.12s]  incorrect punctuation, wrong capitals. Sometimes I capitalize a word in the middle of a sentence
[10722.12s -> 10734.26s]  for no reason. I don't know why. It just like feels right to do that way. I'm going over there.
[10734.26s -> 10739.26s]  No, no, I'm doing this one again. Let's see a new area. We've been on the same areas for a while.
[10739.26s -> 10750.87s]  I'm just like a weird completionist for no reason. New area. Let me take a look. What?
[10750.87s -> 10756.39s]  Does Peach have anything to say? Oh, I'm getting that feeling again. This is not good.
[10756.39s -> 10760.31s]  Has something bad happened again? It feels like it. Mario, please check it out for me.
[10761.27s -> 10774.63s]  I'm texting you this shit. Hey, Peach almost died from a squid. I've been in the hospital
[10774.63s -> 10785.10s]  for three days. I fell off a cliff. What are you talking about? This was made in like 2004.
[10785.10s -> 10789.90s]  And wow, unbelievable how a game from 2004 holds up better than a lot of games I've played in the
[10789.90s -> 10803.67s]  last, you know, German 2006 streamers. Here's a little experiment for those of you guys watching
[10803.67s -> 10811.03s]  right now. One of the last games that I played on this screen that was made after 2011 or 2012.
[10811.67s -> 10829.74s]  What was it? How long was it? Jump King? Okay. Sekiro? That was, no. No, are you serious? That's
[10829.74s -> 10836.39s]  what the last game I played after 2012. Out of Wilds is probably the last one. When did
[10836.39s -> 10844.74s]  Out of Wilds come out? Like 2018, 2019? Red and Evil 2? Out of Wilds? Out of Wilds was like a
[10844.74s -> 10860.70s]  few, a couple months ago. Yeah, that's pretty accurate. Rain World? Yeah, I only played Rain
[10860.70s -> 10881.08s]  World for like an hour though. This guy has no joke right now. Didn't both? Let's play it more.
[10882.68s -> 10901.13s]  I was, we were on Mario Sunshine. Universal Paper Clips? Yeah, that's true. I did beat that game.
[10901.77s -> 10907.51s]  I mean, is that a game or is that an experiment? I did the same thing.
[10913.58s -> 10930.31s]  Yeah. All right, what's this place? Tell the shit stain story. What the fuck are you talking about?
[10930.31s -> 10942.34s]  Dune Buds Sand Castle Secret. Frog Detective? That's true, yeah. We're not only a 2006 streamer,
[10942.34s -> 10961.85s]  we're just mostly a 2006 streamer. This place is cool. Oh, what's that? Triangle.
[10963.90s -> 10969.94s]  Oh, I don't know where that other triangle is, but it ain't over here. It's gotta be close though,
[10969.94s -> 11002.34s]  right? This side? It's probably right over here. No. Variety Influencer? Where's that triangle?
[11002.34s -> 11026.74s]  Right there? Where is it? Right up. No, that's an M. You're going out of bounds. Almost 30 of these
[11026.74s -> 11050.38s]  coins. How are you? What is that? Holy, what is this giant satellite? It's reflecting into the sun.
[11053.83s -> 11060.78s]  Where's that triangle? It has to be close enough to get it before it despawns.
[11061.74s -> 11064.86s]  I don't know, whatever. All right, we gotta find that flower that's here.

[11495.86s -> 11498.90s]  Wow. This place is sick. Alert alert. Just look at the top of the tower.
[11504.23s -> 11507.11s]  Wait, you can't, you can't even hear what I'm saying.
[11514.02s -> 11519.54s]  It's unintelligible. Is it? I can't even, I don't know. I have no idea what it sounds like.
[11523.06s -> 11526.66s]  Oh fuck. I wasn't looking again. All right. Some weird thing has curled up on the tower and
[11526.66s -> 11537.99s]  taken a nap. This is in danger of the legendary sand bird egg. I gotta get on the uh, the
[11538.95s -> 11545.75s]  satellite. Look at this guy.
[11547.27s -> 11552.02s]  I'll have you know that if you use the dune bugs wisely, you can reach heights you never could
[11552.02s -> 11558.84s]  normally. You know, like the tops of huts and places like that. Am I about to kill this motherfucker
[11558.84s -> 11577.64s]  right now? Move out of the way, dude. Oh, I hit the wrong thing out. Again, let's check this out.
[11578.60s -> 11585.77s]  You're a sociopath. How do you, no, you can't just, you can't hear me say like, you can't,
[11585.85s -> 11591.29s]  okay. I'm not, I can't look at Kylo Ren drive-through impression and that makes me a sociopath.
[11592.63s -> 11606.25s]  Hey, look it up. Oh, I love this thing. Look at this guy.
[11607.13s -> 11616.52s]  Spray it with water and try to upset the balance. Oh shit. I just upset the balance.
[11623.03s -> 11635.19s]  Well, fuck. How do we get rid of him? Um, I gotta get over this way.
[11643.54s -> 11645.94s]  Oh, don't fall. Don't fall. I gotta go over here.
[11655.22s -> 11681.53s]  I need you over here. Hey, stupid. Hey, stupid. I need you over here. Stomp that. Stomp that.
[11681.53s -> 11686.49s]  I just did. Oh, there's the other triangle.
[11696.01s -> 11703.45s]  Oh, please. Oh, you upsetting me. What the fuck is happening? I can't jump on him.
[11703.93s -> 11716.78s]  Alright, now I gotta get this to tilt over here so I can jump up there. Is that enough?
[11717.98s -> 11726.52s]  To go like, yeah, walk with who? Dude, I didn't know that's what this was gonna do.
[11731.35s -> 11737.29s]  Alright, now I gotta do that one. I'm almost out of water. Wait, should I go all the way up?
[11739.91s -> 11747.46s]  No. Irma, your brain. What? Can I get that from here? Is this his first time? Yeah,
[11747.46s -> 11750.42s]  I've never played this. Yeah, it's my first time. Can I get that from here?
[11755.06s -> 11759.78s]  He's got an 8-inch brain. What are you talking about? You have to knock them off.
[11760.82s -> 11765.70s]  Really knock them off? You have to get the dudes off the mirrors? I thought they were
[11765.70s -> 11769.86s]  just helping me. I thought I would... What do you mean I have to get them off the mirror?
[11770.98s -> 11786.14s]  That's a lie. I just need them all over here so I can jump. Like this. Ready? Oh my... That's
[11786.14s -> 11801.62s]  not correct. Okay, slow down. Spray it in the face with water.
[11842.65s -> 11845.61s]  I know what I have to do. I have to get them off the mirrors?
[11849.94s -> 11859.90s]  I went too hard. I went too hard. I went too hard. That was too much weight. Alright, let's do it.
[11859.90s -> 11863.10s]  Okay.
[11869.06s -> 11895.88s]  Nobody tell him. Tell me what? Don't hold that shit for me. Come this way. Get over here. Here we go.
[11897.54s -> 11900.58s]  Nice. Smart. Nice. Smart. Play it smart. Play it smart. Play it smart.
[11901.54s -> 11916.17s]  I actually... That's... Oh god. Damn it.
[11917.13s -> 11966.12s]  So, I have to move this shit out of the way, right? Was I timed out? I don't know. I gotta move this mirror out of the way. It's keeping them... Let's not help them.
[11966.84s -> 11973.66s]  Tell us the shit stain story. There is no shit stain story. What are you talking about?
[11977.02s -> 11983.58s]  Tell us the... Oh, tell us the shit stain story. Oh sure. Okay, one time I shit my pants.
[11984.46s -> 11991.74s]  And didn't get rid of the underwear or something. And then, oh, haha, that's it. What are you talking about? I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.
[12012.52s -> 12028.15s]  How are you?
[12028.15s -> 12030.39s]  What is making the...
[12032.39s -> 12039.40s]  Oh my hell.
[12039.40s -> 12044.12s]  Alright, will you guys relax over here? Come on. I want to get on this.
[12047.56s -> 12049.16s]  Come here.
[12049.16s -> 12052.44s]  Look, there's a nice hasty Mario over here. Don't you want to come over here?
[12053.40s -> 12119.48s]  Alright. See ya. Get the fuck out of here.
[12124.68s -> 12133.16s]  Okay. Weren't winks supposed to be discounted? No, not till community content night. I decided to move it.
[12134.84s -> 12143.02s]  Where's it going though? Where do I pick that up? Oh, all the way over there.
[12144.55s -> 12151.85s]  Fucking wink arrow. Worst arrow.
[12153.98s -> 12163.77s]  Alright. So, hold on a second.
[12165.37s -> 12180.58s]  I think I know where that is. Across the way. There's another wink there. Like, over here, isn't it?
[12181.22s -> 12187.62s]  Where is it? I saw it over here.
[12189.27s -> 12192.31s]  There's a knot right there. Alright. How do I get over there faster than that?
[12193.35s -> 12198.82s]  Hash V button.
[12198.82s -> 12215.34s]  What a good strategy.
[12215.42s -> 12219.02s]  You fucking idiot. Do you not see what I'm doing here? Being a weirdo.
[12237.11s -> 12243.96s]  Why can you do this?
[12244.04s -> 12249.40s]  Yes.
[12249.40s -> 12263.96s]  All these basics. If you get it, you do. If you don't, I don't care. I don't care. Ooh, crap.
[12264.60s -> 12267.29s]  Can go in the submarine thing?
[12275.13s -> 12277.13s]  Alright. So, let me...
[12279.88s -> 12282.04s]  Is it a turtle? Is it a turtle?
[12284.38s -> 12287.26s]  Okay, is Bowser a turtle or is he a dinosaur? Which one?
[12288.62s -> 12294.55s]  Or is he a combination of both? He's a turtle.
[12298.68s -> 12304.36s]  He's a koopa. That's right. A made-up animal. So, no, I could say crab. I could say dinosaur.
[12304.36s -> 12312.44s]  I could say turtle and it'll all be accurate. Okay. Wiggler ahoy. Full steam ahead.
[12315.80s -> 12317.88s]  Koopa is a made-up animal. A koopa.
[12318.36s -> 12323.11s]  Fist.
[12323.11s -> 12328.55s]  Yeah, I went when Charles Darwin was at the Galapagos. I don't think you remember. I don't remember him riding down Koopa.
[12339.98s -> 12345.74s]  Get on. Oh, come on. Get up. Wait. What the fuck did I just do? Something. Oh, I know what to do now.
[12345.90s -> 12347.90s]  I'm picking it out on my own.
[12348.38s -> 12360.02s]  You gotta launch him.
[12360.10s -> 12362.10s]  Flip him. Flip him.
[12365.37s -> 12367.45s]  Wow. What was that? Did you hear that crackling?
[12379.46s -> 12381.46s]  Ooh, that crunching.
[12381.94s -> 12383.94s]  Oh, the crunching's killing me.
[12384.42s -> 12385.78s]  Oh.
[12385.78s -> 12388.28s]  It's an emulator audio.
[12388.52s -> 12403.40s]  That's not a fucking crunchy ass audio.
[12404.12s -> 12411.58s]  It's not an emulator. I can show you the disc. It's in there. I'm laying it on a fucking leaf.
[12412.54s -> 12445.56s]  Oh,
[12445.56s -> 12447.56s]  Jesus Christ.
[12454.15s -> 12455.35s]  Come here.
[12455.35s -> 12461.54s]  Oh, get this over with so I don't have to do this anymore. It's crushing me.
[12462.52s -> 12464.52s]  It's like chewing sand.
[12464.84s -> 12466.84s]  This one. This one. This one. This one. This one. This one. Over here.
[12467.32s -> 12471.22s]  You're almost...
[12475.69s -> 12479.77s]  Stop rubbing your socks on the rug.
[12484.94s -> 12488.23s]  Flip him.
[12488.23s -> 12490.07s]  Why would he flip?
[12490.07s -> 12491.83s]  Am I doing this wrong?
[12491.83s -> 12513.14s]  Flip him. All right. Get up there.
[12513.78s -> 12515.78s]  Come on. Yeah.
[12515.94s -> 12518.44s]  This is the last time.
[12519.08s -> 12520.92s]  Last time.
[12520.92s -> 12523.42s]  All right.
[12523.58s -> 12536.46s]  Why was that so loud? Rubbing your socks on the ground on a dry ass day.
[12537.26s -> 12539.26s]  Uh-uh. That's so funny.
[12539.26s -> 12556.74s]  What are you doing over here? What are you? A little... A little... Bye, JP.
[12557.54s -> 12585.48s]  What? Don't come this way. He wants me to go over here. That's a fucking crab's face.
[12586.44s -> 12590.28s]  That is not a turtle's face. That is very much a full... Like the crab has that...
[12590.60s -> 12594.28s]  That's a crab face. Might be a turtle animal, but it's a crab face with crab eyes.
[12595.24s -> 12597.24s]  I will win that argument every time.
[12597.64s -> 12599.64s]  You want me to take you to court? Would you like to go?
[12600.04s -> 12610.41s]  The sand bird is born.
[12610.57s -> 12617.46s]  Take me to crab court. Would it be crab court or turtle court?
[12619.27s -> 12621.27s]  No, it would just be regular claw.
[12656.50s -> 12658.50s]  I'm... Okay, here's what's happening right now.
[12658.66s -> 12660.66s]  This is something that it's pretty interesting to think about.
[12661.46s -> 12662.82s]  I am
[12662.82s -> 12667.06s]  triggering an automatic response from a lot of people where they hate hearing somebody sing.
[12669.99s -> 12671.99s]  It's an interesting phenomenon.
[12672.31s -> 12680.76s]  You hate hearing somebody like sing. It's like, ugh, shut the fuck up. I don't know why it happens to some people.
[12681.56s -> 12695.16s]  How do we get in there?
[12695.16s -> 12697.43s]  Bounce.
[12697.43s -> 12705.08s]  My friend is like that.
[12705.08s -> 12707.08s]  Make it!
[12708.22s -> 12710.22s]  Okay. Oh, I can go that way.
[12716.20s -> 12718.20s]  All right, we're in.
[12720.73s -> 12722.46s]  Sing more.
[12722.46s -> 12728.98s]  Uh-huh. What the hell is this?
[12728.98s -> 12730.98s]  It's like Shadow of the Colossus.
[12731.30s -> 12735.30s]  The legendary sand bird is climbing around the tower. Watch your feet.
[12736.18s -> 12740.81s]  All right, so what's this? We just get
[12740.81s -> 12743.18s]  coins?

[12749.74s -> 12751.42s]  All right, I was gonna say...
[12751.42s -> 12755.70s]  I got hit by the cloud. You can get hit by clouds.
[12756.58s -> 12758.58s]  Don't you pass through clouds?
[12763.34s -> 12765.34s]  That's inaccurate. Clouds are not solid.
[12806.79s -> 12811.91s]  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[12813.98s -> 12815.98s]  STOP. STOP. Somebody stop him.

[12833.46s -> 12835.46s]  All right, where's... I'm becoming a crab level.

[21642.33s -> 21647.29s]  three or four days in a row at least this is what we're doing i'll get sorry i was spurting your
[21647.29s -> 21682.07s]  face that would have been really rude there it is all right go over there it's all right i still
[21682.07s -> 21696.57s]  made it the hell you got the turbo nozzle turbo nozzle press and hold r to power up the turbo
[21696.57s -> 21704.89s]  nozzle and do a super dash well we gotta go in here first oh this is one of these levels uh oh
[21708.14s -> 21744.42s]  uh oh uh oh holy fuck panics panics there's some panics there i bet germa can't do this first try
[21744.42s -> 21749.62s]  well you can't bet that i'm not gonna do something after i fail it you gotta do that well before
[21749.62s -> 21762.82s]  like but whether during this first the first loading screen yeah i fucked it up i thought it
[21762.82s -> 21774.76s]  was i just don't know why i didn't always miss you bet i can't do this within five tries
[21775.96s -> 21780.65s]  probably right sometimes you got to go fucking risky shit like this
[21782.42s -> 21798.36s]  oh why did i die that would have been fine he just instinctively pressed buttons in mario i don't know
[21798.36s -> 21817.03s]  why it's probably the right play though let's be safe did i not make that really serious
[21817.67s -> 21826.71s]  i needed to be like uh yeah you actually you have you probably have to go to the other one
[21826.71s -> 21844.14s]  i was trying to skip it it sounds drained no it's just this no i'm fine i don't want anyone to be
[21844.14s -> 21863.75s]  concerned about me i'm all right i want to do this i already am so he's coming down from the
[21863.75s -> 21868.55s]  crack that's the problem he just he smoked so much crack and now he's like on the down
[21868.79s -> 21877.70s]  i've been having a lot of fun though this game is fun it's fun just to play and just dick around
[21877.70s -> 21884.79s]  and stuff he needs more crack i was probably gonna end soon anyways i wanted to do i wanted
[21884.79s -> 21891.35s]  to like separate this out between like three to five like six to seven hour streams there's
[21891.35s -> 21900.92s]  plenty of content to do every day he's really gonna stretch out mario sunshine yeah i mean
[21901.08s -> 21923.06s]  yeah yeah yeah all right where am i going over this way stalling well it's not stalling it's
[21923.06s -> 21929.18s]  just spreading stalling would be if i sat at the starting soon screen talking about how i can't
[21929.18s -> 21940.02s]  wait to play mario sunshine for 45 minutes i turn i started playing almost immediately so that's
[21940.02s -> 21949.66s]  the difference i'm gonna try this at what here's plan try this one more time like this i am going
[21949.74s -> 21955.43s]  to go wait what's the matter you want to leave all right give me a second
[21955.43s -> 21960.90s]  i was like i want to get out of this room you want to get out of the room okay come on
[21960.90s -> 21979.21s]  so
[21991.21s -> 21999.50s]  all right he's good oh he's diluting his content here he's diluting i'm not diluting
[22000.14s -> 22021.11s]  diluting let me dilute i'm not diluting oh i mean i'm i'm in mario yeah that's that's that's the whole
[22021.11s -> 22032.62s]  point he's mega milking his content i shouldn't be laughing at what you said but i am i shouldn't
[22032.62s -> 22039.91s]  laugh at that i should not be laughing at that statement he's actually playing mario sunshine
[22039.91s -> 22053.91s]  yeah that's fucking great this game's awesome i love it so far all right here we go spin and
[22053.91s -> 22056.79s]  here we are all right that's the plan here we go get the one out
[22059.58s -> 22073.83s]  really okay now what happens over here what does this thing do what is that oh god that's um all
[22073.83s -> 22116.68s]  right i can go down a wall run holy shit is it moving those cubes probably shouldn't even be
[22116.68s -> 22126.31s]  jumping that was bad what was that weird timing right there this is all the timing's all fucked
[22126.31s -> 22138.94s]  up look at this shit what what the hell was that this is what was it that timing that was weird
[22139.58s -> 22156.09s]  that was my fault yeah it was that was my fault i take full responsibility for what just happened
[22156.57s -> 22185.00s]  oh yeah let's try this again we're just gonna run uh okay they do they sweep across
[22186.20s -> 22201.48s]  go holy shit that thing tilts us sideways wow it was starting to turn until
[22207.40s -> 22210.36s]  oh they threw i gotta run into the corner when that happens
[22227.18s -> 22232.17s]  at least i'm getting this every time so we can do this infinite amount of times
[22232.89s -> 22240.70s]  they're trying to teach me then it went out the corner shit i'm gonna lose it i'm gonna fail it
[22240.70s -> 22277.62s]  again probably i wouldn't be surprised okay here we go oh okay what the hell i had to hit my head
[22277.62s -> 22288.66s]  on the ceiling okay what happens here so i don't know this i don't know that i don't know what to
[22288.66s -> 22310.82s]  do i'm gonna which one this one which one oh yeah oh yeah all right now jump off for a joke
[22351.10s -> 22363.54s]  save the game save 26 stars 39 blue coins and that's what i'm gonna call it stretching content
[22363.54s -> 22372.49s]  is what we call this uh it's six hours this is gonna be like a that's that's that's normal
[22372.49s -> 22380.38s]  that's under the six to seven hours that's what that's a normal stream for me don't leave

[22760.76s -> 22771.93s]  250 did you write off the carnival stream as a business expense uh yes at least a lot of it
[22776.39s -> 22787.85s]  some of that stuff you can't write off it's too bright off it's not like you'd be like okay
[22787.85s -> 22794.65s]  and this is what happened and there's there it is it's over you kind of need to go piece by piece
[22794.65s -> 22804.04s]  but i have i have a lot of the documents and things that are ready to go so don't worry about
[22804.04s -> 22813.43s]  that but for the most part yes i can do a lot of writing off on those things but i did say
[22813.43s -> 22818.71s]  remember i said this a long time ago just if you're talking about you know spending money
[22818.71s -> 22829.10s]  on the business in quotes um i'm gonna do shit like that i'm gonna spend a bunch of
[22829.10s -> 22836.30s]  fucking money if i have it because it's if it's available i want to like put it back and try to
[22836.30s -> 22844.28s]  do something interesting or try to do something fun if it's if i'm capable of doing that and i
[22844.28s -> 22859.45s]  have the money to do it then i'm gonna try business laughing my ass off all right this
[22859.45s -> 22874.47s]  this warrant's being put on this is good actually that's great oh super frog sunshine but yeah
[22878.30s -> 22882.86s]  yeah i had if you're wondering why i took an extra day i was getting my taxes prepared to
[22883.50s -> 22892.34s]  get stuff sent to my cpa and get going from there just get it done that's why i was gone
[22892.34s -> 22901.69s]  yesterday i just didn't get it done all the way we know you don't do your taxes i yeah i prepare
[22901.69s -> 22924.68s]  it for somebody else that's way smarter than me to do it yes that's correct why are us taxes so
[22924.68s -> 22934.18s]  hard for fuck's sake uh it's yeah yeah it's well there's another thing is just especially
[22934.18s -> 22939.54s]  considering like where like a lot of this money comes from it's a lot more it's a lot different
[22939.54s -> 22945.14s]  than just i have a w2 and okay and here's what i owe here's what i'm gonna get back there's a
[22945.14s -> 22961.86s]  lot of weird little moving parts but that's why it takes a while fringe taxes for fail country
[22962.74s -> 22968.79s]  um every all countries paid to have taxes what are you talking about was there some
[22968.79s -> 22974.66s]  status but what are you talking about where are you what what are you on some random island that's
[22974.66s -> 22978.18s]  in like the atlantic ocean or something what are you talking about all countries have to pay taxes
[22979.66s -> 22994.87s]  at least for the most part all right let's go uh peaceful hailey thanks for the 250 hailey hey

[23126.20s -> 23131.32s]  regular goomba i would be like a goomba captain i would be a high ranking goomba

[23516.15s -> 23523.77s]  fuck i know that life is annoying they took a biopsy of my stomach it might not be anything at
[23523.77s -> 23533.77s]  all but it might mean my pain might never go away sorry to hear that that's never fun like i said
[23533.77s -> 23539.61s]  earlier i had these fucking mystery symptoms for two years no idea what it is i know what i knew
[23539.61s -> 23545.77s]  i had colitis for my whole life essentially the last at least 12 years or so like i've known that
[23547.21s -> 23553.86s]  but when you have some new random medical problem that you cannot nobody can actually tell you this
[23553.86s -> 23563.56s]  is exactly what's wrong with you it's a huge pain in the ass what if you're allergic to something
[23563.56s -> 23570.28s]  you're eating i it's not it i had a full i had a full allergy panel so they tested for everything
[23571.24s -> 23578.60s]  nothing and sometimes you have to just kind of you just kind of have to punch at it while you
[23578.60s -> 23587.93s]  just try to live your normal life just cast full heal on yourself you dummy i wish that that were
[23587.93s -> 23595.00s]  real imagine you just cast heal on yourself and just like oh wow i feel fucking perfect
[23599.99s -> 23608.28s]  but i try i try not to let this shit bother me because obviously if it did if it if i let it
[23608.92s -> 23614.20s]  annoy me and irritate me and bother me all the time then i would just be it would just be in a
[23614.20s -> 23618.68s]  bad place where i would just be annoyed and miserable all the time so i'm trying to look
[23618.68s -> 23621.16s]  on the bright side and just be like all right i'm just gonna keep going at it and just see what
[23621.16s -> 23635.59s]  happens and if it turns out that i have to go do this fucking injection into my nerve
[23636.71s -> 23653.91s]  i'm god i've gotta do it like i'm gonna do it not at that point yet we'll see but i don't i don't
[23653.91s -> 23658.07s]  really like to i mean we talk about this kind of medical stuff sometimes but i i really don't
[23658.07s -> 23663.99s]  like talking too much about it only when i have to because i don't want people to think that there's
[23663.99s -> 23670.71s]  something wrong oh he's he must be in so he must be in pain right now streaming dude don't stop
[23670.71s -> 23676.04s]  streaming what are you doing get out of here it's like i said this before and i'll say it again if
[23676.04s -> 23681.72s]  i wasn't comfortable which has happened before at least a handful of times i just won't stream i'll
[23681.72s -> 23685.88s]  just tell you hey i'm not it's not happening today maybe tomorrow that's happened at least a
[23685.88s -> 23692.92s]  handful of times over the last few months of course it has i'm not going to do that so don't
[23692.92s -> 23698.04s]  worry about that i'm not i'm not going to just like stream and sit here and be in like pain or
[23698.04s -> 23703.98s]  anything like that it's that and that doesn't really happen that much anyways it almost happened
[23703.98s -> 23710.63s]  today yeah but today was weird because it just kind of i've never been in that in a scenario
[23710.63s -> 23714.79s]  before where okay here here's like a new thing that's like might be i like i pulled like a
[23714.79s -> 23725.00s]  muscle in my tongue somehow it's still there but this is exactly how it started when my chest and
[23725.00s -> 23729.72s]  back started to hurt it was just like oh this hurts what's wrong what what is that did i just
[23729.72s -> 23735.74s]  pull my muscle in my back i must have oh that's where that's not going away let's stay now this

[24043.43s -> 24061.38s]  i zoom right in on the joe joe why can i why is this am i even resizing this fucking thing
[24062.34s -> 24094.38s]  okay so i see you have sands back there what else you got both like a skunk oh yeah but at what point
[24094.38s -> 24110.02s]  do you get pulled over for this they're everywhere your car has sticker acne this is if reddit was a
[24110.02s -> 24134.01s]  car wait what does this one say bitch i'm going oh you oh mode ban this guy i can
[24137.06s -> 24154.57s]  what is this car all right cool car oh bitch i'm going uh i don't even know what that means
[24158.65s -> 24162.65s]  i'm not i'm not gonna ban somebody if i have a reddit car i don't even know what that means
[24165.86s -> 24169.22s]  say it right i how am i supposed to say something right that i've never heard in my life
[24179.21s -> 24189.46s]  uh when am i gonna have my own stickers oh um i don't know maybe someday who knows if that's
[24189.46s -> 24203.21s]  ever actually gonna happen i have no idea there's all kinds of things that i want to do
[24204.25s -> 24210.71s]  there's all kinds of things that i want to do but i gotta focus on one thing at a time
[24211.67s -> 24227.42s]  where's the background music oh whoops but um we'll move on i can't tell you when or if
[24227.42s -> 24232.54s]  what happened hey this is eskilo 13 for the 250 hello jerk but this is nintendo calling we want
[24232.54s -> 24239.50s]  you to explain this video uh but for reals most of my edits got deleted on community content night
[24239.50s -> 24251.66s]  like this one and this one yeah there's gonna probably as much as i don't want to say this
[24251.66s -> 24259.11s]  i think it's i should that there are so many submissions to community content night
[24260.23s -> 24269.08s]  i cannot show every single submission anymore there are sometimes month to month
[24270.55s -> 24281.69s]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of submissions and at first when people first start to figure
[24281.69s -> 24285.45s]  out oh we're just gonna put whatever i know we can just it'll just get on stream whatever that's
[24285.45s -> 24293.21s]  cool but going forward i it is gonna have to be some type of some type of like a initial
[24295.08s -> 24300.20s]  kind of content filter i guess and show things selectively and just because of the amount of
[24300.20s -> 24306.63s]  submissions is just so many and i really don't want to do a case where which it's not like i
[24306.63s -> 24312.55s]  felt it happening in any of the other ones but so let's say for instance either the community
[24312.55s -> 24317.67s]  content streams they're all they're all between four and the last one was what four and a half
[24317.67s -> 24324.78s]  hours they're between like four and five hours and i'd like to maybe instead of have those
[24324.78s -> 24333.99s]  potentially go even higher to like six plus hours we we got to start to because i don't want to just
[24333.99s -> 24339.03s]  skip through them oh i i know that we're going to be here for six and a half hours going through
[24339.03s -> 24343.11s]  artwork and edits and stuff so look at that one oh that one's kind of cool look at this one and
[24343.11s -> 24346.87s]  then look at that one and then this one and oh that one's pretty cool look at the line work oh
[24346.87s -> 24353.27s]  this one essentially you have to channel surf quickly otherwise you'll be there for 10 hours
[24354.31s -> 24361.50s]  so at this point probably going forward there's going to be at least a base level of sort of
[24361.50s -> 24366.06s]  selectively choosing what goes on to the stream and that's not to say that everything's going to
[24366.06s -> 24370.38s]  just oh wow now there's only going to be like 15 pieces of artwork and it's only going to be the
[24370.46s -> 24377.19s]  fucking insane ones that took people like six weeks to make no but there'll be at least a base
[24377.19s -> 24392.55s]  filter where we try to shave it down a little but that's kind of where that stands that's where that
[24392.55s -> 24404.71s]  stands no meme generator type stuff yeah originally originally like photoshops are were in there and
[24404.71s -> 24410.55s]  they could be funny and they can be fun but i don't know it's it's tough it's tough to try to
[24410.55s -> 24419.06s]  put like some kind of filter on it i'm still trying to figure that out now show the frogs
[24419.06s -> 24434.30s]  again oh like i accidentally did wait oh this uh why is it not here i'm trying to show the frogs
[24434.30s -> 24447.94s]  i'm clicking on them why i don't know they're not showing how can i not show the frogs they
[24447.94s -> 24460.49s]  should be on the screen right now oh there they are wait did we just big money just come in
[24461.45s -> 24471.29s]  another 50 from phylactery all these these red numbers holy shit guys phylactery another
[24471.29s -> 24479.72s]  5000 bits give me a fucking germa germ plus you streamer re 50 from core monster
[24480.84s -> 24484.28s]  if you don't do pachinko first thing tomorrow i'm gonna scream i will i'll beat it first thing
[24484.28s -> 24497.38s]  tomorrow maybe re resident sleeper but thanks both of you that's a lot of fucking money you
[24497.38s -> 24507.90s]  guys give a lot of money a lot i appreciate it anyways let's keep going uh let's go to lm man
[24507.90s -> 24514.20s]  for 500 bits five dolls from lm man germa when are you going to do viva piñata probably not
[24514.20s -> 24520.90s]  this week because i really want to get mario sunshine done and if we do mario sunshine for
[24520.90s -> 24528.49s]  the next three four straight days between like six seven ish hours or streams six to eight hours
[24528.49s -> 24534.84s]  a stream i would assume for mario sunshine that's talking yeah how long is mario sunshine like 20
[24534.84s -> 24540.62s]  hours 25 hours but i'm not just beating the game i'm obviously doing a lot of the extra stuff as
[24540.62s -> 24549.42s]  he's seen today doing it like six to eight shines in each level is going to take how long
[24550.30s -> 24559.86s]  would you guys say not 100 in the game but i'd say like how long would like 70 in the game take
[24563.99s -> 24571.56s]  18 hours i don't know i only watch speed runs of it oh average run is like 16 hours
[24574.34s -> 24581.90s]  okay all right well we'll see the whole stream the all the content 15 20 hours that makes sense then
[24584.38s -> 24591.85s]  yeah that's that would be like three ish four ish streams sounds good to me but there's not
[24591.85s -> 24599.70s]  gonna be time and then community content nights right after that so there will not be any time
[24599.70s -> 24609.69s]  for anything else this week we'll have to do it next week any percent yeah long as you're not
[24609.69s -> 24613.29s]  doing full blue coins it should be good now probably i just get them when i see them
[24615.43s -> 24619.03s]  hey atrolox atrix thanks for the thousand bits first you played my childhood game
[24619.03s -> 24623.83s]  tony hawks underground now you're playing my childhood game sunshine i love you so much thanks
[24623.83s -> 24631.48s]  also what was the hardest mission during tonight's stream um probably one of the
[24631.48s -> 24639.35s]  jump on the rotating cubes secret levels the chingos not hard i mean it's just dumb
[24640.15s -> 24647.10s]  it's not that mission's that level's not hard it's just stupid and i mean stupid as in it
[24647.10s -> 24653.34s]  not that i don't think it's any fun it's just like you just launch mario for the spring in a
[24653.34s -> 24661.54s]  pachinko machine it's just it's stupid it's not bad it's just stupid mad because bad no no it's
[24661.54s -> 24667.54s]  not bad it's just stupid if if you saw if i was if there's a green screen edit of me flying around
[24667.54s -> 24671.62s]  at a pachinko machine you'd be like well that's this is pretty stupid you'd probably think it was
[24671.62s -> 24684.47s]  cool i would i'm gonna get on that thanks atrolox for the thousand bits 10 bucks appreciate it uh

[24695.27s -> 24699.91s]  to watch the beginning of the stream it'll probably be right at the very end that'll be the last thing
[24699.91s -> 24705.10s]  that we do nobody wants to open a stream like that that's gonna be the last thing that i do
[24705.10s -> 24716.26s]  i'm gonna sit there for 30 minutes and just stare at the camera that's gonna be wicked
[24716.26s -> 24726.15s]  creepy awkward fucking stream i'm gonna lose fans from that stream you got it i gotta rip the bandaid

[24767.50s -> 24783.91s]  stupid no one ever beat this game in quote breakdown no one ever beat this game i don't think so it's
[24784.31s -> 24790.41s]  yeah you may be right i've seen a couple i wasn't even getting mad i was just i mean those these
[24790.41s -> 24798.20s]  levels are fun and interesting enough and it's really easy to start them over again they just
[24798.20s -> 24806.04s]  said the game is stupid but in a good way hey mr kool-aid thanks for the thousand bits germa would

[24826.74s -> 24834.97s]  bits you should play mario kart double dash it's a pretty solid mario kart game what you meant to say
[24834.97s -> 24846.39s]  was the last good mario kart game i'll say it i know you don't have to i will i'll say it
[24847.35s -> 24854.60s]  i know everybody in every all the 2500 people here all thinking it i'll be the one to say it
[24855.56s -> 24860.23s]  let me take the flag for this not you i'll take it
[24871.67s -> 24878.47s]  no but the wee one the wee one i remember this is before i guys this is before i had a
[24879.19s -> 24890.58s]  twitch channel a youtube channel i played the wee one and i fucking hated it i remember playing it
[24890.58s -> 24894.10s]  and just being like oh the new mario kart and being like i fucking hate this thing
[24895.61s -> 24899.45s]  what i'm in first place i'm in second place why do i get hit why do i get hit with a blue shell
[24899.45s -> 24905.00s]  again every time i get in the first place just don't go in first place ever only be in fourth
[24905.00s -> 24911.86s]  place until the last 10 seconds of the race why are these in the game why why does this exist
[24911.86s -> 24916.34s]  because the asshole in ninth place is just going to troll people in the first two places this is
[24916.34s -> 24934.34s]  stupid and i'd fucking never played it again it's a matter of balance that's how all of them work
[24934.34s -> 24949.86s]  not all of them not all of them i need to make it fair so people in last can catch up well maybe
[24949.86s -> 24955.08s]  the people in last place shouldn't have driven into the wall 10 times when you pass when you lap
[24955.08s -> 24964.66s]  toad a third time is is a toad like toad when you lap toad for a third time should toad get a
[24965.38s -> 24977.08s]  shell to throw at you in first place like toad just like pull over toad pull over and cheer from
[24977.16s -> 24996.01s]  the side at that point toad come on toad deserves it there was a dick what we're talking about
[24996.01s -> 25006.70s]  mario kart this is mario kart here we're not talking about like life remember it's that's you
[25006.70s -> 25014.22s]  hate no no hey we're talking about mario car top up passing toad three times and you get hit with
[25014.22s -> 25020.14s]  a turtle shell because on your third time passing him he accidentally pressed the fucking a button
[25020.14s -> 25044.23s]  in the right way and hit you with a green shell everyone loves mario kart unless you're inherently
[25044.23s -> 25052.23s]  evil i don't think so i don't think i don't think it makes you evil to be sick of toad in the fucking
[25052.23s -> 25068.54s]  back throwing blue shells at you he's a villain i can't be evil i can't be evil he's got something
[25068.54s -> 25078.34s]  against toad no okay but all right how many put the music on how many times have you it's a
[25078.34s -> 25082.82s]  fucking video game it's my free time if i'm gonna be in first place in a video game in my free time
[25082.82s -> 25089.35s]  i would like to stay in first place unless i do something wrong and tipped it and if i'm gonna
[25089.35s -> 25100.12s]  pass toad five times i paid for this game with 60 i'm at the finish line and i get hit with a
[25100.12s -> 25104.68s]  bullet bill in a blue shell and now i'm in seventh place and i gotta read through the
[25104.68s -> 25113.75s]  level every spy paid 60 for this game you beat you're beating up but you're beating a kid
[25123.43s -> 25126.89s]  so it's like toads like yeah what are you talking about toads it is like late
[25126.89s -> 25146.46s]  30s if you're in first the whole race it's boring that's where you took a wrong turn you paid 60
[25146.46s -> 25166.01s]  dollars for a video game he's definitely raged at somebody at like we online or something no i
[25166.01s -> 25170.17s]  know that's what some of you guys are thinking he must be so bitter for mario kart week because it
[25170.17s -> 25177.69s]  was the first time nintendo even tried to do online oh and by the way this is the new mario
[25177.69s -> 25185.61s]  kart for the uh for the ipad i did not know this until um until it was brought to my attention
[25185.61s -> 25196.89s]  that game's not online you're playing against bots i thought it was online they give them flags
[25197.61s -> 25206.90s]  and names and some of the names are different languages and shit it's just like that you it's
[25206.90s -> 25219.64s]  like they're pretending that there are people playing i bet he lost i did because i got hit
[25219.64s -> 25223.16s]  with a blue shell in the first place like five times because i'm in first place you leave me
[25223.16s -> 25237.45s]  alone best place to be mario kart in third place this is why you're mad old people fail fall for
[25237.45s -> 25249.19s]  so many scams it used to be like an old pastime of mine to see how many times i could pass toad
[25249.91s -> 25257.29s]  in super mario kart for super nintendo on the bowser level you could do it six or seven
[25257.29s -> 25263.34s]  potential plus times that was the game was all right it wasn't about how many how many times i
[25263.34s -> 25279.61s]  could win the race it was i need to pass toad eight times this time am i am i psycho this is
[25279.61s -> 25291.21s]  making me like a psychopath i mean is it am i like does this make me a psycho i'll bring this to the
[25291.21s -> 25296.38s]  doctor you're like hey what do you think about this oh hey here comes the time interval pretends to be
[25296.38s -> 25312.62s]  the doctor oh fuck toad that guy sucks yeah by the way let's take a look i'm not doing it anyways

[26231.48s -> 26238.70s]  stand-up you read off the donations most of which were like who are you i went up to you after and
