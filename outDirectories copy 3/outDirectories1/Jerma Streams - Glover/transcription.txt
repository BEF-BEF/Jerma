[3.38s -> 7.22s]  So if you don't know what Glover is, again, it's an N64 game where you play as a Glov.
[7.22s -> 14.58s]  And this music is pretty great, actually. I don't want it to be that loud, though.
[14.58s -> 38.09s]  Can you see it? Where the fuck is it? Come on, Glover! Glover.
[38.09s -> 56.50s]  So I'm gonna use a controller. This sucks.
[57.80s -> 60.52s]  Excuse me! What do you mean, do you guys...
[60.52s -> 63.32s]  Excuse me, this was picked in pre-stream chat. You got...
[63.32s -> 66.60s]  Okay, Glov buddies, I would be ready, because you're gonna have to defend yourselves.
[66.60s -> 72.42s]  This is a Glover for the N64. If one of the mods could please change the stream to this.
[73.14s -> 74.42s]  Do you remember this place? This sucks.
[75.70s -> 77.38s]  You haven't even seen one second of this game.
[91.35s -> 92.15s]  Billy.
[92.15s -> 100.44s]  Cutscene. Shut up.
[100.44s -> 112.71s]  Is it evil character? The wizard?
[112.71s -> 118.97s]  Is my cam lagging from this game? I think it is.
[122.90s -> 137.66s]  The accident. The crystals.
[137.66s -> 140.87s]  Your viewers are tanking.
[146.42s -> 150.74s]  All right, Glov buddies, you got a lot going against you right now.
[150.74s -> 165.35s]  Okay, so Glover, you play as a Glov and you have a ball.
[165.35s -> 167.19s]  You can switch to different balls.
[167.19s -> 170.44s]  I'm gonna have to move the camera, probably, because it's in a bad spot.
[170.44s -> 179.59s]  Does that work?
[179.75s -> 188.73s]  Let's do a poll now.
[188.73s -> 189.77s]  No, what?
[189.77s -> 193.51s]  Hi, my name is Mr. Tip. If you want any hints, just speak to me.
[193.51s -> 196.09s]  You can do this by sending me and pressing B.
[196.09s -> 200.76s]  Oh, by the way, you can press and hold B if you ever lose your ball.
[200.76s -> 211.37s]  All right, let's go. Glover Pog.
[211.37s -> 212.89s]  Oh, that's why my ball is over here.
[212.89s -> 218.41s]  It's like fucking scary.
[218.41s -> 226.22s]  All right, I got my ball. How do I use the ball?
[226.22s -> 227.98s]  This is the entrance to the practice level.
[228.62s -> 231.34s]  Jump in the well to learn the valuable tips and tricks.
[235.37s -> 238.65s]  Return balls to the cave to open the gateways to other worlds.
[238.65s -> 251.13s]  How do you jump? That was actually kind of cool.
[251.13s -> 253.62s]  All right, here we go. Glover action.
[254.18s -> 257.48s]  You can do this by sending me and pressing B.
[258.60s -> 265.72s]  To spin the camera. Yep.
[265.72s -> 272.63s]  To control Glover without the ball, press left trigger.
[272.63s -> 282.60s]  Okay. Yep. Jump. Cool. Sounds pretty fun.
[282.60s -> 285.82s]  To negotiate steps, try bouncing the ball.
[285.82s -> 291.45s]  This can be done. Yep, I know that one.
[291.45s -> 295.03s]  That's kind of fun.
[295.03s -> 296.55s]  To duck, press and hold left trigger.
[296.55s -> 298.63s]  Tapping left trigger will make Glover do a cartwheel.
[298.63s -> 314.63s]  To get over higher walls, try throwing the ball.
[314.63s -> 324.07s]  To do this, hold B, then push and hold L in the direction that you want to throw.
[324.07s -> 330.70s]  You got it.
[330.78s -> 332.46s]  Holy shit. What the fuck?
[332.46s -> 332.96s]  Glover!
[333.50s -> 340.17s]  You can also use the throw action to get across gaps.
[340.17s -> 342.33s]  If you are about to slap or throw the ball,
[342.33s -> 345.62s]  you can change your mind by pressing left trigger.
[345.62s -> 347.43s]  Okay. So like, you mean like this.
[347.43s -> 353.26s]  Like, ah, no, I don't want to do that.
[353.26s -> 355.42s]  Whoops.
[355.42s -> 371.70s]  Oh my god. Glover bat chest.
[371.70s -> 374.58s]  Glove buddies, you're fucked, I think.
[384.15s -> 386.23s]  Glove buddies are going to be like not even 5%.
[387.50s -> 389.82s]  Some gaps are too wide to throw the ball across.
[390.46s -> 392.70s]  Hold A and push and hold in the direction you want to slap.
[392.70s -> 393.90s]  Yeah, okay. Yep. Remember this.
[394.78s -> 402.62s]  Oops. You're a levitating glove.
[407.42s -> 411.08s]  Nice. Okay.
[412.04s -> 414.36s]  This is a ball switch. Place the ball here to activate it.
[417.22s -> 420.12s]  Nice. This is sick.
[427.43s -> 429.43s]  Alright, let's see you pull. Let's see you pull.
[429.43s -> 432.95s]  Alright, glove buddies, this has to be, we're starting at over 50%.
[434.26s -> 436.74s]  Can you do that? Can the glove buddies get this over 50%?
[441.66s -> 451.85s]  Shallow water can be crossed without a problem.
[451.85s -> 453.61s]  You cannot hold the ball in deep water.
[453.61s -> 455.61s]  You will need to use the ramps to get the ball out. Okay.
[456.49s -> 457.69s]  I'll just slap it over there.
[468.31s -> 471.75s]  These crates can be broken by fist slamming them by just jumping and pressing left trigger.
[471.75s -> 485.16s]  Okay. You can use your magic to change your ball.
[485.16s -> 487.32s]  If you are holding it, press right bumper.
[487.32s -> 497.58s]  How are we doing on the pull? Glove buddies are just children.
[503.66s -> 508.04s]  Whoa. They got it?
[509.00s -> 514.09s]  Do you guys understand that this goes up?
[515.11s -> 517.43s]  This goes up by 5% every like 15 minutes.
[518.23s -> 520.68s]  This is a Glover switch. Use fist slam to operate it.
[520.68s -> 526.89s]  Alright. Just like strawberry magic.
[526.89s -> 528.89s]  We've got to keep, we've got to be honest with ourselves here.
[532.58s -> 534.74s]  Some ledges may be too high to throw the ball.
[534.74s -> 536.50s]  Try combining bounce and throw.
[537.22s -> 543.11s]  I need a bouncy one.
[543.11s -> 548.15s]  What the fuck just happened?
[550.49s -> 556.95s]  What? Change the name.
[556.95s -> 558.31s]  What's the, what is the name of the stream?
[558.87s -> 563.94s]  Oh, God damn it.
[564.58s -> 570.25s]  I had this game when I was five and I could only play this tutorial because every enemy scared me.
[572.20s -> 573.80s]  That is like, I like that.
[573.80s -> 577.53s]  Yeah. We're at 60%.
[578.25s -> 587.69s]  Fuck you.
[587.69s -> 593.77s]  Yeah. And so in 10 minutes, we're going to do it again.
[593.77s -> 596.25s]  If it's not 55% at least, then I'm going to, I'm changing it.
[597.50s -> 598.78s]  That's how we do it here.
[598.78s -> 616.86s]  To what?
[616.86s -> 618.89s]  I don't want to tell you what the game is because then
[618.89s -> 620.57s]  some of the glove buddies might change their mind.
[621.05s -> 627.51s]  You know what I mean?
[627.51s -> 629.03s]  I got, I got to be careful here.
[629.03s -> 640.30s]  How do I do this?
[651.86s -> 652.34s]  Old B.
[660.09s -> 666.79s]  Ah, how can you be bad at Glover?
[674.82s -> 675.94s]  What do you mean bad at Glover?
[675.94s -> 678.18s]  I've done, I've played this game in like 30 years.
[686.02s -> 686.50s]  Does that count?
[690.26s -> 702.90s]  Got it.
[702.90s -> 703.54s]  Oh shit.
[703.54s -> 704.34s]  I have to, okay.
[704.34s -> 704.84s]  Yep.
[708.34s -> 716.86s]  I got to get more mods on that list if people like to change title.
[716.86s -> 717.10s]  All right.
[717.10s -> 719.26s]  So I mean, glove buddy.
[719.26s -> 721.58s]  How about glove buddies versus everyone?
[721.58s -> 722.54s]  Does that make sense?
[722.54s -> 723.90s]  I look weird when I'm flipped.
[724.90s -> 729.99s]  Like, like I look weird flipped horizontally.
[729.99s -> 730.39s]  All right.
[730.39s -> 741.91s]  Glove buds, glove buddies, glove buddies versus everyone else.
[742.55s -> 751.19s]  I'm going to end up changing this in fucking 15 minutes.
[758.46s -> 759.18s]  Okay.
[759.18s -> 760.86s]  Glove buddies versus everyone else.
[761.42s -> 770.23s]  Glover.
[770.23s -> 770.55s]  All right.
[770.55s -> 775.34s]  Let's go loud.
[776.07s -> 776.23s]  Okay.
[776.23s -> 776.47s]  Hi.
[776.47s -> 782.66s]  My name is, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[782.66s -> 783.54s]  So now where do I go?
[783.54s -> 784.74s]  Is that kind of like Super Mario, right?
[784.98s -> 790.79s]  How about in here?
[790.79s -> 796.74s]  No, blocked straight in here.
[796.74s -> 807.90s]  Oh, he took my way.
[807.90s -> 808.94s]  That's my ball.
[808.94s -> 810.97s]  Whatever.
[810.97s -> 819.50s]  Okay.
[819.50s -> 821.42s]  I think I need to collect these gems.
[821.42s -> 826.38s]  This is just Mario.
[826.38s -> 833.10s]  Dude, Glover, this is, this is a classic game from the Nintendo 64 era.
[833.10s -> 837.54s]  Wait, where's my ball?
[837.54s -> 848.39s]  All right.
[848.39s -> 849.19s]  Level one.
[849.19s -> 853.11s]  Zoomers don't know what this is.
[853.11s -> 854.47s]  That's all right.
[854.47s -> 858.09s]  All right.
[858.09s -> 858.81s]  Let's go.
[858.81s -> 870.25s]  Collect gar ribs, gar ribs to score points.
[870.25s -> 871.53s]  Get 50 and win an extra life.
[872.09s -> 872.41s]  All right.
[873.21s -> 885.85s]  I'm trying to slap it.
[891.50s -> 892.54s]  Does that not hurt?
[892.54s -> 906.30s]  Got it.
[906.30s -> 908.14s]  You can use your magic to change your ball.
[908.14s -> 909.02s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[909.02s -> 914.31s]  It's really nostalgic.
[914.31s -> 916.47s]  I think the only time I ever actually played Glover
[917.03s -> 919.27s]  was when I rented it from Blockbuster one time.
[920.60s -> 921.40s]  I don't think I got it.
[921.40s -> 921.88s]  I didn't get it.
[922.76s -> 926.12s]  I think I just kept changing the ball in the tutorial and thought it was cool.
[926.84s -> 930.31s]  Like I kept doing that.
[930.31s -> 930.55s]  Yeah.
[931.59s -> 933.67s]  And I walked around with a bowling ball and then I returned it.
[939.18s -> 939.74s]  Ball soon.
[939.74s -> 939.98s]  Yep.
[940.54s -> 941.88s]  Let's get another ball in there.
[942.52s -> 945.08s]  Looking for 55% to continue.
[945.08s -> 946.92s]  Glove buddies, you're up against the world here.
[946.92s -> 947.32s]  Good luck.
[950.65s -> 952.81s]  Objects with cracks in them can often be smashed.
[952.81s -> 953.13s]  All right.
[953.85s -> 958.20s]  I need 50 of these.
[958.20s -> 966.97s]  Some enemies can be destroyed by fist slamming.
[966.97s -> 967.21s]  Yeah.
[968.09s -> 970.82s]  What?
[970.82s -> 971.54s]  What the fuck is that?
[983.69s -> 984.57s]  Is it 55?
[990.68s -> 992.36s]  This game looks like ass.
[994.92s -> 995.24s]  Okay.
[998.22s -> 998.54s]  Hey.
[1003.11s -> 1003.35s]  Hey.
[1005.03s -> 1007.03s]  It is a classic video game.
[1007.03s -> 1007.27s]  Okay.
[1011.38s -> 1014.02s]  I don't know if the Glove buddies are going to be able to keep it over 55.
[1014.26s -> 1014.66s]  By the way.
[1015.54s -> 1023.06s]  We'll see.
[1023.06s -> 1027.32s]  It's a misleading poll.
[1029.88s -> 1031.00s]  Misleading poll.
[1033.46s -> 1034.34s]  Is it misleading?
[1038.02s -> 1039.94s]  Well, what else could it possibly be?
[1046.46s -> 1048.54s]  What else could that poll possibly be for?
[1049.10s -> 1055.35s]  I need to do a recount.
[1055.35s -> 1056.47s]  I didn't get it.
[1060.95s -> 1061.11s]  All right.
[1061.11s -> 1061.91s]  We'll do a recount.
[1070.02s -> 1070.98s]  It's misleading.
[1076.86s -> 1077.34s]  Fine.
[1077.34s -> 1077.82s]  Fine.
[1077.82s -> 1078.14s]  Fine.
[1079.26s -> 1080.54s]  All right.
[1080.54s -> 1081.26s]  Fine.
[1081.26s -> 1082.38s]  It was a misleading poll.
[1082.94s -> 1083.80s]  Do it again.
[1087.26s -> 1088.94s]  Only 5k people voted.
[1091.78s -> 1092.02s]  All right.
[1092.02s -> 1092.74s]  We need a recount.
[1095.11s -> 1095.51s]  Fine.
[1096.23s -> 1097.51s]  55% is what you're looking for.
[1098.39s -> 1116.12s]  This music is pretty good though.
[1116.12s -> 1116.60s]  Listen to this.
[1122.98s -> 1132.34s]  This is corrupt.
[1134.82s -> 1135.62s]  It's not corrupt.
[1135.62s -> 1136.42s]  What are you talking about?
[1137.06s -> 1145.51s]  I gotta go up there.
[1147.11s -> 1148.39s]  Oh, this is corrupt.
[1149.03s -> 1152.12s]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[1152.12s -> 1154.41s]  How do I get it out of the water?
[1155.05s -> 1159.74s]  Oh, there we go.
[1159.74s -> 1172.14s]  How are we doing?
[1189.85s -> 1190.33s]  It's not.
[1190.89s -> 1191.37s]  It's not.
[1191.37s -> 1191.85s]  Oh, boy.
[1192.79s -> 1193.59s]  47%.
[1194.79s -> 1195.27s]  No way.
[1197.03s -> 1198.31s]  This is your only last.
[1198.31s -> 1199.27s]  This is it.
[1199.27s -> 1199.59s]  Really?
[1202.06s -> 1204.06s]  The Glove Buddies can't get this to happen?
[1221.30s -> 1222.74s]  This feels rigged.
[1222.74s -> 1223.06s]  How?
[1223.70s -> 1224.34s]  I just...
[1225.06s -> 1226.98s]  I don't think there's enough passion
[1226.98s -> 1229.38s]  like there was for Strawberry Magic for Glover.
[1231.08s -> 1231.72s]  Should I go in there?
[1232.87s -> 1233.11s]  Yeah.
[1233.75s -> 1247.69s]  51%.
[1247.69s -> 1248.01s]  Uh-oh.
[1253.18s -> 1253.58s]  Really?
[1254.30s -> 1254.94s]  What?
[1254.94s -> 1256.14s]  Is this Zoomers 1?
[1257.18s -> 1257.50s]  What?
[1258.30s -> 1265.86s]  I can't.
[1265.86s -> 1266.98s]  I can't believe it.
[1266.98s -> 1267.94s]  You have to stop playing.
[1267.94s -> 1268.18s]  What?
[1268.18s -> 1268.58s]  I...
[1268.58s -> 1269.46s]  Hold on.
[1269.46s -> 1276.36s]  Hold on.
[1276.36s -> 1276.84s]  Give me a second.
[1285.56s -> 1286.52s]  Give me a second.
[1286.52s -> 1287.32s]  Stop now.
[1287.32s -> 1287.96s]  No, not yet.
[1287.96s -> 1288.36s]  Hold on.
[1288.36s -> 1288.60s]  Give me...
[1288.60s -> 1288.92s]  I will.
[1288.92s -> 1289.40s]  Give me a second.
[1292.02s -> 1292.58s]  That did not...
[1292.58s -> 1294.02s]  I thought that was gonna last a little longer.
[1303.11s -> 1303.51s]  Okay.
[1303.51s -> 1305.03s]  So I'm gonna stop playing
[1305.03s -> 1306.95s]  once I get one puzzle piece.
[1315.91s -> 1316.39s]  Holy shit.
[1316.39s -> 1317.43s]  Look at how big I am.
[1317.43s -> 1318.09s]  Isn't that cool?
[1327.35s -> 1328.95s]  What weird kind of shit is this?
[1328.95s -> 1330.55s]  Dude, it's Glover.
[1330.55s -> 1332.46s]  Don't fall off the mountain.
[1337.48s -> 1339.56s]  You didn't know what it was like back when I was a kid.
[1340.49s -> 1341.45s]  You didn't know what it was like
[1343.85s -> 1345.77s]  to rent a video game from Blockbuster.
[1346.58s -> 1348.82s]  I have no idea what the fuck it was
[1348.82s -> 1351.38s]  because there was no such thing as the internet.
[1352.57s -> 1355.05s]  You went by what the cover looked like
[1355.91s -> 1356.79s]  and you got home.
[1356.79s -> 1357.67s]  You put it in.
[1357.67s -> 1359.51s]  You put it in.
[1359.51s -> 1360.07s]  Press play.
[1360.63s -> 1361.27s]  How's the game?
[1361.91s -> 1362.47s]  It sucks.
[1363.11s -> 1365.29s]  Well, you're not gonna return it
[1365.29s -> 1367.69s]  because you have it for like four days from Blockbuster.
[1367.69s -> 1369.69s]  So this is what you're gonna do for the next four days.
[1374.50s -> 1375.22s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[1375.86s -> 1378.74s]  How do I get up there?
[1378.74s -> 1381.82s]  It was seven days.
[1381.82s -> 1382.78s]  It depended on the release.
[1382.78s -> 1383.82s]  Some of them were like two days.
[1385.91s -> 1387.11s]  Remember new shit was like
[1387.83s -> 1389.43s]  a day and a half or something ridiculous?
[1390.15s -> 1392.76s]  You guys remember that?
[1393.40s -> 1403.50s]  You're so old.
[1403.50s -> 1404.50s]  Can I break that?
[1405.69s -> 1406.17s]  Wait, what?
[1406.17s -> 1407.21s]  Can I hold on?
[1407.21s -> 1409.03s]  How do I activate this?
[1410.07s -> 1412.15s]  I have to activate something with the big body.
[1415.37s -> 1415.93s]  This is cute.
[1415.93s -> 1417.05s]  What's wrong with this?
[1417.05s -> 1417.61s]  This is good.
[1417.61s -> 1417.85s]  Yeah.
[1418.49s -> 1420.98s]  What's your problem?
[1421.54s -> 1427.21s]  How can I get this move?
[1427.21s -> 1432.97s]  How do I move this?
[1433.69s -> 1440.87s]  Where's the camera?
[1440.87s -> 1448.97s]  How do I get it to move?
[1448.97s -> 1449.85s]  30 minutes?
[1451.38s -> 1452.66s]  No, no, no, no.
[1452.66s -> 1454.10s]  I'm not gonna play this for 30 more minutes.
[1455.37s -> 1457.05s]  The same rules applied.
[1457.05s -> 1457.53s]  Okay.
[1458.33s -> 1458.89s]  Hold on.
[1459.53s -> 1467.34s]  This was a prank?
[1467.34s -> 1468.38s]  No, this is not a prank.
[1469.50s -> 1470.70s]  In the pre-stream, people were like,
[1470.70s -> 1471.98s]  yo, dude, Glover Pog.
[1472.78s -> 1488.47s]  Let me just do this last level.
[1488.47s -> 1490.63s]  By the way, the game that we're moving to is Blood.
[1490.63s -> 1491.77s]  It's a first-person shooter.
[1491.77s -> 1493.53s]  It's an old DOS first-person shooter.
[1494.17s -> 1500.97s]  You're a liar.
[1500.97s -> 1501.93s]  I'm not a liar.
[1501.93s -> 1503.37s]  I said we weren't gonna play for another five minutes.
[1504.01s -> 1507.24s]  I want some weight here.
[1507.80s -> 1517.29s]  I could actually see myself playing this.
[1518.01s -> 1528.20s]  How much?
[1528.20s -> 1528.84s]  I'm looking at the chat.
[1528.84s -> 1529.32s]  Am I looking?
[1529.88s -> 1530.46s]  Okay.
[1530.46s -> 1530.86s]  All right.
[1530.86s -> 1531.10s]  All right.
[1531.10s -> 1531.58s]  I fell off.
[1532.78s -> 1533.66s]  This is this.
[1533.66s -> 1535.26s]  This is kind of a PogChamp game.
[1535.90s -> 1536.94s]  This Pog game.
[1537.58s -> 1540.15s]  Is that right?
[1540.15s -> 1540.87s]  This is kind of Pog.
[1542.34s -> 1543.30s]  Dude, you fell off.
[1544.49s -> 1547.05s]  You can't fall off in 20 minutes.
[1547.05s -> 1549.05s]  You can't fall off in 20 minutes.
[1549.05s -> 1549.85s]  Okay?
[1549.85s -> 1550.81s]  You can't fall off.
[1550.81s -> 1551.69s]  I didn't fall off.
[1551.69s -> 1552.89s]  It's been 15 minutes.
[1552.89s -> 1554.57s]  You don't fall off in 15 minutes.
[1555.37s -> 1555.69s]  You know what?
[1555.69s -> 1559.59s]  You don't fall off.
[1559.59s -> 1560.47s]  Dude, you literally fell off.
[1560.47s -> 1561.27s]  No, I didn't fall off.
[1562.26s -> 1562.90s]  I didn't fall off.
[1563.54s -> 1564.73s]  All right.
[1564.73s -> 1565.61s]  Let's play Blood.
[1565.61s -> 1566.57s]  That was Glover.
[1566.57s -> 1567.21s]  It was fun.
[1567.21s -> 1567.93s]  It's a cool game.
[1571.37s -> 1572.09s]  It's fun.
[1572.09s -> 1573.69s]  You probably like it if you got it.
[1573.69s -> 1573.93s]  Maybe.
[1573.93s -> 1576.12s]  I don't know.
[1576.12s -> 1576.36s]  All right.
[1576.36s -> 1577.16s]  Let's play Blood.
[1578.01s -> 1579.05s]  That was a cool fall joke.
[1580.87s -> 1581.83s]  There's like half the people here
[1581.83s -> 1583.35s]  that at Glove Buddies have pissed.
