[2.74s -> 12.49s]  Hello everybody, welcome to the stream. I'm sorry, I was in chat talking about taxes.
[12.49s -> 20.38s]  We were discussing taxes, paying taxes and all that stuff. What are taxes? You know, we had to
[20.38s -> 24.38s]  go through an entire... this is for the vlog viewers, by the way. We had to go through an entire thing
[24.38s -> 34.02s]  of what taxes are dating back to the British, right? That's where it started and that's, you know,
[34.74s -> 40.34s]  that's how... that's where it began. And now the British now run the IRS, so we still have to pay
[40.34s -> 58.46s]  England. It's weird, but you know, no. Yeah, the one thing about taxes I will tell you is if you
[58.46s -> 67.66s]  are 1099, right? Because I used to be... you get a W-2 and somebody pays your taxes. And so I took
[67.66s -> 73.98s]  up money for health insurance and retirement and, okay, I don't have to do anything. When you become
[73.98s -> 81.03s]  full 1099, it's all you, man. You're gonna do it all. And it's just like, wait, hold on, what do I
[81.03s -> 91.42s]  have to do? But back in 2011, I got a CPA and I made sure... I was like, please, like, make sure
[91.42s -> 104.42s]  this is all correct. Thank you. And I've been using them for like seven years. Keep those receipts. Oh
[104.42s -> 111.24s]  yeah. And they have to like... that's like the next part is understanding what is like an expense,
[111.24s -> 121.77s]  what isn't an expense. It's difficult stuff. QuickBooks self-employed is pretty helpful.
[123.56s -> 127.88s]  Yeah, I just... I'm an idiot and I'll fuck something up. I'd rather just have somebody that
[127.88s -> 134.33s]  knows what they're doing that specializes in it, be able to do it, because I can't. I'll open up
[134.33s -> 138.33s]  QuickBooks and I'll be like, oh yeah, this, this, this, this, send it in. I'll get it wrong.
[138.65s -> 151.48s]  No, no, no, no. A good accountant is like a good mechanic. If you find one, do everything you can
[151.48s -> 163.45s]  to keep them. That's, that's the best statement I've read in the last 10 seconds. Even everything
[163.45s -> 178.81s]  laid out. And never do it for free. The next statement is the best. What about a barber?
[178.81s -> 183.45s]  That's yeah, there are a couple of things that you really need to hold on to in life. A good
[184.25s -> 190.74s]  CPA, like a good accountant, right? A good, a good doctor, right? Everybody wants a good doctor,
[190.74s -> 197.70s]  good accountant, good doctor, good car mechanic, a good lawyer, a good chef. Make sure you always
[197.70s -> 203.42s]  have a good chef around in your house. A good maid to make sure like you're very clean.
[205.26s -> 209.21s]  All these people have to come with you, by the way, wherever you go. And they all need a room
[209.21s -> 224.50s]  in your house. A good mailman. That's right. Yep. Imagine you had a doctor like live in your house.
[224.50s -> 230.36s]  Oh, that'd be fucking amazing. That'd be the best thing ever. I wish that were the case.
[231.54s -> 234.74s]  Imagine waking up with like you, you, you brushing your teeth and you're like, wait,
[234.74s -> 238.02s]  hold on. You're like, you stick your tongue out. There's like a little spot on your tongue and
[238.02s -> 241.70s]  like your tongue hurts. That's happened to me. And what am I going to make a doctor's appointment
[241.70s -> 249.16s]  for that? No, no, you just go bang, bang, just like, Hey doc. And it's like, it's like six
[249.16s -> 252.44s]  o'clock in the morning. He's like, fuck, what is, what is it? Hey, look at my tongue for a second.
[253.48s -> 257.56s]  He's like, hold on to me. And he like pulls the tongue and let me see that. Nah, that's just an
[257.56s -> 260.84s]  inflamed taste bud. You're going to be fine. It's like, Oh God. And he goes back to bed.
[266.23s -> 270.87s]  And then like you go to the next, you know, while that happens, I drop a plate and it smashes on the
[270.87s -> 274.31s]  ground and the doctor goes back to bed and I'm like, yeah, don't worry about it. I go to the next door.
[276.12s -> 282.12s]  Uh, maid? Open the door. Yeah. I just dropped a plate on the ground. Can you like help? Can
[282.12s -> 286.33s]  take care of that? Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Like they take care of that and you're good.
[289.29s -> 296.15s]  Oh God. That's got $50. I'm just going to have like a hotel of employees,
[296.79s -> 305.30s]  not even employees though. It's just all people that do jobs that are, that are very like skilled
[305.30s -> 313.27s]  jobs, things that, that are difficult to do a service jobs. Have like a police officer too,
[313.27s -> 319.22s]  just to have in here, just in case like the doctor fights the mechanic over breakfast or something,
[319.22s -> 322.58s]  like somebody who picks up a fork and he starts to lunge and all that. Oh, the cop is going to
[322.58s -> 334.62s]  take care of that. Just explaining this is the white house. This is just being the president.
[335.75s -> 354.26s]  This is the, this is being the president. Uh, anyways, thank you too. But to, all right,
[354.26s -> 363.03s]  to back us up here. Yes. Uh, having a good accountant is a good thing to have, especially
[363.83s -> 370.33s]  because you got to make sure you buy the book. Otherwise, uh, I'm going to have to answer that
[370.33s -> 376.34s]  door and it's my turn to open the door and it's a laundry list of, excuse me, you're coming to
[376.34s -> 380.50s]  court now. And I'm like, hold on, wait a minute, get the chef. And the chef comes down and he's
[380.50s -> 385.03s]  like, what's happening? And he's like, oh, you get, you're getting arrested. All right, whatever. I
[385.03s -> 395.10s]  can't do anything about that. Or it was the chef and I like to take the chef and I like push him
[395.10s -> 401.21s]  in front of it. It was the chef that did it. What are you talking about? I just cook and they're
[401.21s -> 413.99s]  like, they like cuff him up. He, oh yeah, he was cooking the books. I understand. And then I like
[413.99s -> 418.71s]  wink at the, I wink at the fucking guy at the, at the, the officer at the door. I'm like,
[431.40s -> 435.40s]  fuck that whole segment. What do you mean that joke was awful? Somebody, one of you guys said
[435.40s -> 445.24s]  that I was responding to it. It was a great joke actually. Mod that guy that made it.
[446.38s -> 453.99s]  No one said that. Yes, they did. Scroll up. They're now modded. Okay. Anyway, what are we doing?
[453.99s -> 461.03s]  Where am I? I'm in front of, I'm in front of a stream. Oh, shift the blame. Yeah, it was this guy.
[461.03s -> 474.46s]  It was this guy, Jacob. It was me. All right, we're going to play, uh, jack pox, jack pox party pox.
[475.18s -> 478.47s]  That's what we call it here. We're going to play jack box tonight.
[478.47s -> 482.23s]  Then we might as well just switch over to it right now because, uh, why not? It's right here.
[483.67s -> 496.41s]  Jack pox party pack, jack pox party pack five. It is going to be fun. Did I say it was going to
[496.41s -> 502.71s]  be fun? Why am I speaking in the past tense here? That doesn't make very much sense. But,
[502.71s -> 511.19s]  but more importantly, $50 came in from cookie CRM. 50, $50. Thank you cookie for the 50 bucks.
[512.90s -> 517.62s]  Hey, German, just a heads up. Uh, patently stupid is not a good game for stream. It's not very funny
[517.62s -> 526.79s]  or fun to play. Split the room in mad verse city are fantastic. All right, well we'll see.
[527.75s -> 535.02s]  I mean, we're going to try them all even if we do it once, but I heard, I have heard that a few of
[535.02s -> 540.55s]  these, at least two or three of them are very fun and very funny, but whatever this is, this is,
[540.55s -> 545.74s]  this is community night. You know, we do, we do sometimes we do, we do community night here.
[545.74s -> 557.91s]  You know what I mean? Uh, by the way, speaking of that, how this is going to work tonight
[558.71s -> 566.47s]  is just kind of scared me. So, uh, in the sub room of the discord is going to get the code.
[568.46s -> 574.14s]  There are a lot of you now, so good luck getting into the room. If you get into the room,
[576.12s -> 583.05s]  we kindly ask that you do not come back for another game. Uh, you can only play once. If
[583.05s -> 587.61s]  there's a way that I can remove somebody or I have to restart or something, that's what we're going
[587.61s -> 593.37s]  to do, or we might have to make a separate room, I will figure it out, right? But only one time,
[594.74s -> 605.67s]  only one time. So, I hope you're ready to begin, because I'm ready to begin. Which one are we
[605.67s -> 610.14s]  going to start with? How about we just go from top to bottom? Does that make sense? Why is this one
[610.14s -> 622.12s]  not family friendly? This is the only one that's not family friendly. What does that mean? We mean
[622.12s -> 631.08s]  it. Well, what do you, what does that mean though? All right, well, the parent, okay, this is the not
[631.08s -> 639.90s]  safe for work trivia game. All right. Oh, let's do it. You don't know Jack. You don't know Jack.
[639.90s -> 647.86s]  Shit. So how's the audio? Should I turn myself down? What are you trying to say? What are you
[647.86s -> 660.30s]  trying to say? What are you trying to say? Oh, I didn't tell Twitter. Ah, you're right. I didn't
[660.30s -> 671.64s]  tell Twitter. What do you say? This is the stream. There's people looking up at my bald fucking head.
[671.64s -> 678.18s]  I'm not even bald. Why do we do this thing on this channel where things are just absolutely
[678.18s -> 684.25s]  100% not true and we treat them like they are? You died to pinwheel. No, I didn't. You're bald.
[684.25s -> 691.58s]  I have fucking more hair than probably half the people on this website. I got a full head of hair.
[691.58s -> 706.50s]  What, what's the bald thing? You're stupid. Oh, really? I can't. All right. Well, that one might.
[706.50s -> 725.30s]  I can't fight that one. You're short. Not that short. All right. Let me tweet this up. Oh,
[725.38s -> 732.49s]  Chunky baloney. Chunky baloney giving out five community subs. Thank you, Chunky.
[735.88s -> 742.63s]  That is five. That is a five spot from Chunky baloney. I got one. I got one.
[744.73s -> 754.01s]  Thanks a lot, man. Your hair smells. My whole body smells. What are you talking about?
[757.82s -> 762.62s]  No, no. I mean, not right now. Hold on a second. I'm supposed to be tweeting out the stream.
[765.29s -> 785.21s]  Yeah. Jack box five. And then after the stream, hold on. Jack box five. See, now I tweeted it out.
[785.21s -> 794.46s]  Now everyone can relax. You know what I'm saying? Um, describe, describe the smell. Um,
[797.96s -> 809.93s]  cinnamon, uh, uh, jade, cinnamon and jade, clean cinnamon jade laundry. There you go.
[810.65s -> 819.58s]  All right. Uh, this needs to be, uh, right. Audiences on require Twitch, right? That's
[819.58s -> 827.88s]  important. Post game sharing. Um, I don't think I want to do that. Hi, gibberish. I would have to
[827.88s -> 834.70s]  delete my Twitch channel if that were the case. Uh, allow room hiding. Yep. Allow room code to be
[834.70s -> 838.54s]  hidden to prevent players from joining early. Recommended if you're streaming the game. Yes.
[839.10s -> 848.28s]  Max players eight. Sounds about right. Sounds about right. Let's scroll up a little bit here.
[848.28s -> 856.42s]  Okay. All right. I think that's good. Make the game loud. Oh no, that was them. Just all right.
[856.42s -> 862.73s]  Here we go. So, uh, for pro grammatically generated content, I think I'm going to,
[862.73s -> 869.24s]  I think I'm ready. So how Jack box works, you know, played it streaming services,
[869.24s -> 873.48s]  they'll tell you pipe is more than just the trivia hit. You don't know. Jack.
[873.48s -> 880.28s]  It's also a deep well of content that we cannot legally guarantee. You'll ever be able to access
[880.84s -> 890.30s]  or interact with. But, uh, so you go to jackbox.tv and once you're in jackbox.tv,
[890.30s -> 895.69s]  you're going to get a room code. If you're in the sub discord, it's going to show up
[895.69s -> 899.53s]  there in just a moment. What's the matter, Mark? I'm trying to find my blood type,
[899.53s -> 906.81s]  but these medical forms are just so complicated. Nevermind. Not for this first game by the way.
[907.61s -> 910.97s]  No, just send all your information to binge pipe and they'll find the
[911.85s -> 916.57s]  not for the first one. Hey, come on in everybody. Welcome to the first day. Yeah.
[916.57s -> 920.57s]  History credit card details, voting record, deepest fears, food allergies,
[920.57s -> 925.29s]  romantic preferences, and lucky numbers. And they'll sort through it to find the data I need
[925.29s -> 930.89s]  and leftover details for themselves. That sounds great. Looks like I won't need this paperwork.
[931.69s -> 935.69s]  And with the extra time we can get whatever. Do you like burritos?
[935.69s -> 942.65s]  I don't know. I'll have to ask binge pipe. Sorry. Sorry. I'll do it again.
[943.77s -> 947.69s]  The number one over medication that prevents nosebleeds caused by whatever it's we're going
[947.69s -> 952.01s]  to be here for like four or five hours. It's okay with your mind. Then my taxes is right.
[952.01s -> 959.45s]  Go to jackbox.tv. Put an HZ NE punch. I am the lion punch. You'll be able to participate as the
[959.45s -> 966.25s]  audience of the demon ways. Protector of the five shards of the crow core. HZ NE
[968.57s -> 971.13s]  avenge my father. And that's what I'm going to do.
[973.37s -> 976.41s]  Yeah. I wanted to, I wanted a mod or two to play the first game and then I was going to
[976.41s -> 979.93s]  put it in the sub discord and then I accidentally pressed that button.
[981.05s -> 987.21s]  I have to, my father just saw what happened. I have to do it and I will do it with or without
[987.53s -> 992.49s]  felt that was going to happen. I'm in the room. What are you talking about?
[992.49s -> 999.77s]  I'm in the sub discord right now. All right. So everybody's in. No way. Press everybody's
[999.77s -> 1006.57s]  in the start. That's a lion punch on binge pipe. Please just press everybody's in.
[1009.00s -> 1015.38s]  Do I, do I have to join? No. Wait, what? Do I have to do that?
[1015.86s -> 1023.21s]  To be the new home of you don't know Jack. $50. No, $50 is not a stock photo.
[1026.26s -> 1030.26s]  All right. I'm cookie Masterson and I have no idea why they call it a cookie.
[1030.26s -> 1037.30s]  Cookie CRM just gave $50. What do you mean I'm not in the game? That reminds me of my childhood dog
[1037.30s -> 1042.50s]  because he also ate people specifically mine. I don't, it doesn't automatically put me in
[1042.50s -> 1057.69s]  because I'm the host. I have to go on my phone. What? I was the host of the game. I have to,
[1057.69s -> 1066.41s]  oh fuck me. I have to be in the browser. I thought I hadn't played in like two years,
[1066.41s -> 1070.82s]  whatever. I'm not even in the audience. I got to join the audience.
[1076.31s -> 1084.15s]  No, no, I'm turning this off. I can't fucking believe I'm about to do this.
[1086.15s -> 1091.19s]  Enter the, what was the room code? HZHN. What's the room code?
[1094.55s -> 1107.27s]  HZNE. Enter your name. Bill. Okay, I'm ready. I'm in the audience.
[1112.97s -> 1121.43s]  All right. So it's a septillion. Yeah. I hate to lead you on. None of you got it.
[1121.99s -> 1127.51s]  A quintillion has 18 zeros and consequently six commas to go along with it.
[1129.42s -> 1135.42s]  I need to like, no, this is funny. This is cool. I want to participate. I mean, I would keep all
[1135.42s -> 1148.17s]  my money, of course, but the poor can have half the punctuation. Can I participate? I can't. All
[1148.17s -> 1150.97s]  right. I'm like, I run the server here. After this question, I'm going to start over.
[1154.17s -> 1157.29s]  Everyone's going to be mad. I'm going to disconnect everybody. I'm the server.
[1158.01s -> 1159.21s]  I'm just hosting this for people.
[1172.31s -> 1176.71s]  Fucking damn it, man. Right at the very beginning too. How could I possibly screw it up?
[1177.35s -> 1187.11s]  But, um, cookie. Okay. What'd you pick? You did a bad job.
[1189.43s -> 1191.91s]  Well, now we can, we can correct our mistake from beginning.
[1198.42s -> 1205.86s]  I just spit all of my fucking screen. God fucking damn it. I'm so upset right now. You have no idea
[1205.86s -> 1210.62s]  how mad I am. Not at the, I mean, whatever. I screwed up. I spit all, this is a new monitor.
[1210.78s -> 1219.85s]  New monitors in front of me. All right. So this time, first of all, cookie has given a hundred
[1219.85s -> 1225.88s]  dollars. Uh, cookie says, German, we know you screwed up. It's okay. We love you. Anyways,
[1225.88s -> 1233.37s]  big hearts all around. Have some more money. Cutie. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, thank you.
[1235.77s -> 1240.70s]  Thanks a lot, cookie. Well, let's go back in. I, I'm not going to fuck this up again.
[1243.48s -> 1247.16s]  So you can wait here. We're going to the chance of, I'm going to, I do want to mod in because it's
[1247.16s -> 1253.11s]  fun to get one for the first game. We're going to have mods, right? Like I'm going to put like
[1253.11s -> 1259.11s]  a weird body slider in and like pull his eyebrows off. Okay. Don't show the fucking room code.
[1259.11s -> 1266.31s]  Some critics say isn't a real service. It's just a framing device for a video. Okay. These are
[1266.31s -> 1272.31s]  entitled to their opinions and their privacy. So don't go looking for them. They're fine.
[1273.03s -> 1280.36s]  Okay. That's that. Let's make sure we get, I gotta, I have to go into. That's very important.
[1284.39s -> 1288.87s]  I almost did it again. With my old streaming service, I can never get a hold of a customer
[1288.87s -> 1292.55s]  service representative. Now that I'm a binge pipe customer, they never leave me alone.
[1292.55s -> 1296.15s]  I gotta make sure I get it right. I almost just said the name of the room I love.
[1296.15s -> 1300.23s]  We're grateful for their ever seeing eye. The second my binge pipe router went out requires
[1300.23s -> 1306.23s]  Twitch to log in. I have Twitch. Hold on. I gotta like open up another fucking browser.
[1310.87s -> 1319.91s]  What's the fucking code? Thank you, binge pipe.
[1319.91s -> 1326.63s]  I am logged in.
[1329.37s -> 1338.97s]  Twitch. Am I in? I'm in. I'm in. I'm in as Twitch. All right. I'm in as Twitch.
[1344.63s -> 1350.15s]  All right. Here we go. I'm in Twitch. I'm in. All right.
[1352.15s -> 1362.70s]  Good luck everybody. And we are full. Welcome everybody. Thanks for playing. Here we are.
[1370.17s -> 1374.33s]  All right. Everybody's in. Sit back and relax. I'm in. Everybody's in, right?
[1375.67s -> 1382.84s]  That's me, right? That's not like another person. How do I get this back over here?
[1382.84s -> 1390.14s]  Snack on this content. All right. We can play now. Finally. I'm Cookie Masterson. And if my mom
[1390.14s -> 1395.42s]  could see me now, I'd say, what are you doing, mom? I need a note jacked. While I hosted this game.
[1396.30s -> 1401.10s]  Everyone in? I didn't think you knew this many people. And I see we've got some gawkers.
[1401.10s -> 1409.34s]  All right. So we've got two mods, grump and no super you. And then we've got a bunch of other
[1409.42s -> 1420.94s]  random people. All right. Now we start for real. Thanks for hanging out. Thanks for being so
[1420.94s -> 1440.60s]  patient. Thanks for being so patient, guys. All right. I do.
[1443.08s -> 1451.40s]  I don't want to. So hold on a second. If after taking a sociology class,
[1452.44s -> 1455.70s]  that's not even a, this is even a question. It's not even a real question.
[1460.66s -> 1464.98s]  I mean, I know the answer, but that what kind of question is that? Can't do anything right. Can you
[1466.78s -> 1473.10s]  more ease folkways and laws are for cultural norms. Ethics can only help shape norms.
[1473.50s -> 1479.18s]  Okay. Although drinking 12 beers a night also has an effect on the shape of norms.
[1479.74s -> 1485.98s]  And how would our lovely audience do? Oh, just what I look for in an audience. 25% correct.
[1485.98s -> 1490.14s]  That means that right answer is worth even more. 700 of you. You can thank me later.
[1491.58s -> 1499.08s]  All right. Here we go. No, I don't want another question. I want one of these weird things.
[1499.08s -> 1504.28s]  Take a good look. How is this not safe for work? You know, the weird thing about the novel,
[1504.28s -> 1509.08s]  the three musketeers is there's a fourth musketeer wandering around that wasn't this one,
[1509.08s -> 1515.08s]  the not safe for work one started talking about it. If the musketeer left out of the umbrella term,
[1515.08s -> 1520.28s]  three musketeers angrily trademarked their own candy bar, what could they call it?
[1520.28s -> 1527.32s]  What could they call it? The port, those peanut chew Maurice's Milky way or d'Artagnan's date bar.
[1527.64s -> 1541.26s]  What? I don't, I don't, these are like computer generated
[1541.26s -> 1546.94s]  Google questions that an AI decided. It will never go near something called Lumiere's nut log.
[1548.30s -> 1554.86s]  Oh, what not safe for work. The three musketeers, but he spends the whole book as musketeer number
[1554.86s -> 1566.26s]  four. It's all right. I got $744. All right. Super hot aliens for those Huey and Martin short.
[1566.98s -> 1574.94s]  I got it right. 35%. Wow. How do we get to do these cool ones down here?
[1574.94s -> 1579.18s]  Mixed tapes and marmalade. And what goes with that better than a dis or dat.
[1581.58s -> 1587.10s]  Dis or dat. I'm going to list seven things. And for each one, you tell me if it's something that
[1587.10s -> 1592.46s]  happened to Paddington bear in the delightful family film, Paddington two, something that
[1592.46s -> 1599.02s]  happened to rapper Lil Wayne in real life. Okay. Don't think too hard. But I mean both.
[1599.02s -> 1605.66s]  Give you a few seconds to decide between Paddington. Spoilers for Paddington bear.
[1605.66s -> 1613.16s]  And you're all doing this together. So let's do it. No, I don't want to see that born in New
[1613.16s -> 1626.57s]  Orleans. Um, I don't know. I raised by his aunt Lucy. Uh, no, I don't know. It could be both
[1627.83s -> 1636.98s]  worked. It was Paddington bear, a window cleaner. It was, uh, this, this has got to be some story
[1636.98s -> 1646.02s]  where Paddington bear. Oh shit. I didn't answer. I don't, why would Paddington bear is not a human
[1646.02s -> 1654.58s]  being. So no, that's Paddington bear. That's Paddington bear. That's not Lil Wayne.
[1655.54s -> 1664.57s]  Was in a coma. Uh, I don't think Lil Wayne was ever in a coma. What? When was Lil Wayne in a coma?
[1664.57s -> 1671.45s]  You can't spell disastrous without us, but you, why he was, you just plain sucked at that desert.
[1672.73s -> 1677.13s]  Holy shit. Binge pipe customer retention protocol has been activated.
[1677.13s -> 1683.21s]  Sounds like it's screw time. That is the truth cookie. Use the screw to make answering a question
[1683.21s -> 1688.73s]  harder for all the other players. The results may surprise you and you'll receive a bonus for
[1688.73s -> 1696.25s]  anyone who answers incorrectly. This is like an ADHD computer. Use them wisely or don't you do you.
[1697.29s -> 1711.13s]  The question that doesn't care. Are you kidding me? See that, what, but that sentence
[1712.89s -> 1720.41s]  is hurting me. Stig Larsen. The answer of course is Stefan Edberg. It did in 20th century
[1720.65s -> 1732.68s]  Dov Lundgren is the guy from Rocky. No, that's not him. Uh, I don't know.
[1736.63s -> 1747.37s]  Oh, I just gave everybody an answer. Dov Lundgren did not found Ikea. No wait, Dov Lundgren is the
[1747.37s -> 1751.53s]  WWE guy. Oh no, that's another Dov.
[1758.09s -> 1767.62s]  Uh, what is sex? Oh, that's why you can't join it.
[1780.76s -> 1791.38s]  What? Oh, he made it harder. I don't understand. They just made it hard to read?
[1793.67s -> 1797.99s]  No, I just picked the wrong one because I got screwed. I just picked the wrong one.
[1805.27s -> 1806.71s]  It's incorrect on this side.
[1814.04s -> 1820.28s]  That's the whole point. Yeah, well why are we giving people in Jack Puck's party pack?
[1822.58s -> 1826.82s]  The blue turtle shell from Mario Kart is trivia questions, man.
[1831.85s -> 1836.33s]  Currently player four is in the lead. All right, Drosophilia doing all right.
[1837.53s -> 1843.85s]  These players are making everyone feel bad. So here comes the screws. And don't forget. Oh,
[1843.85s -> 1849.21s]  more screws. And they'll net you more cash for each player that gets the question wrong. So
[1849.21s -> 1852.73s]  don't be afraid to use them. The rest of you better answer quick. Screw this entire game.
[1855.21s -> 1858.49s]  Remember questions are worth twice as much. Oh, plus two. What are you trying to say?
[1858.49s -> 1860.01s]  Just wonderful cookie.
[1865.66s -> 1869.26s]  Try this on for size. Turtles all the way down.
[1870.46s -> 1876.46s]  Going by the divine comedy. Are there more levels of hell or seasons of entourage?
[1876.46s -> 1881.02s]  More levels of hell or seasons of entourage? There is more entourage.
[1881.02s -> 1882.94s]  So watch out. What the fuck?
[1884.62s -> 1887.82s]  I'm just trying to answer the question. Don't forget your password.
[1889.99s -> 1900.36s]  What is the password? We have to put a password in. What? Did I get it? Wrong password.
[1904.49s -> 1910.25s]  I can't even type the password in right. According to Dante, there are nine levels of hell,
[1910.25s -> 1917.98s]  but there are only eight seasons of entourage. I did type the phrase and I couldn't get it.
[1917.98s -> 1928.86s]  What is entourage? It's when Mark Wahlberg showed on camera
[1930.54s -> 1937.74s]  how cool his life is. That's the whole show. That's actually the entire show.
[1938.70s -> 1942.30s]  There's nothing else to that show besides Mark Wahlberg has a really cool life.
[1949.66s -> 1955.18s]  While solving a mystery all the game spoilers the tag of his collar floating in a pool of blood.
[1955.18s -> 1960.30s]  How do they know it's his? It's shaped like a paw print. It's shaped like a scooby snack.
[1960.30s -> 1966.06s]  It's shaped like his head or it has his initials on it. What is on scooby-doo's collar? I think
[1966.06s -> 1970.06s]  it's it has his initials on it. Stop giving people answers.
[1970.06s -> 1984.44s]  I forgot you could hear me.

[2911.02s -> 2926.26s]  but i'm not made out of gold so the longer it takes the room to answer the more bonus points

[3025.75s -> 3031.27s]  the book you have to spend a minute looking at looking at do you spend 10 minutes reading it
[3033.27s -> 3037.11s]  is a well is a book full of every nice thing anyone's ever said about you i don't want to
[3037.11s -> 3052.33s]  know that for every minute you spend look at what i mean that's not i mean i don't want to

[3056.66s -> 3061.32s]  i mean like if you open it up you're gonna then you're gonna start to pretty much think

[3115.66s -> 3120.30s]  so for five dollars an hour you can hire i could hire an impersonator to stream for me

[8831.96s -> 8852.54s]  he just said if i win i'm gonna feel bad why ipad contains of viruses
[8859.59s -> 8866.79s]  all right where my next two mcs at here we go we got lucratius versus uh fang kora

[8911.00s -> 8918.54s]  it's fucking crashed oh dear what was your line what was your rap luke
[8926.07s -> 8944.39s]  why is jack box crashing what is here to crash well um luke is the new green screen
[8945.11s -> 8954.71s]  too many graphics well i think we're gonna do i think that that was any time as any
[8954.71s -> 8966.34s]  to open up uh party pack four do i have party pack four it crashed for me as well that's annoying
[8966.34s -> 8986.60s]  do i not have this how did i play this before no i i i already own this was it on ps4 i might
[8986.60s -> 8998.55s]  have i might have owned it on ps4 yeah i think it's on ps4 oh maybe not hold on maybe i might
[8998.55s -> 9007.13s]  be on the wrong thing here no yeah you your account already owns this game so how why can
[9007.13s -> 9016.07s]  i not install it it's weird no it was telling me oh you can purchase it but it's weird all right
[9016.07s -> 9026.90s]  let's just get party pack four go on here that's so annoying that one's definitely the best one i
[9026.98s -> 9032.57s]  think maybe we need some other people in like a voice to do the other games so i'm just gonna
[9032.57s -> 9050.68s]  put this up temporarily while i get this going give me one second here's jack box i yeah i have
[9050.68s -> 9055.72s]  all of them the only i don't have is two i don't have two so for some reason i have every single
[9055.72s -> 9067.24s]  one but two the other one is you give presentations so it's way better when people are talking yeah
[9067.24s -> 9076.28s]  that's that's true is it the same site jack box four it is the same site for all of them so you
[9076.28s -> 9090.22s]  are good to go i'm opening it i'm going to mute the audio here because it's probably gonna be
[9090.22s -> 9095.18s]  very loud so opening party pack four probably should change the title to party pack four
[9098.57s -> 9114.33s]  it is very loud so all right oh yeah we got fibbage three save the internet full screen mode

[13072.90s -> 13085.50s]  is this what is going on is that supposed to be legs well it's either legs or i don't know
[13085.50s -> 13089.10s]  what this is and then is that supposed to be like rick that's rick from rick and morty he was gonna
[13089.10s -> 13114.12s]  write this is rick all right so we got a guy with this guy with legs congratulations good luck now

[13169.26s -> 13190.55s]  arms what started this tetris turned into this up next all right go good luck really focusing on
[13190.55s -> 13200.92s]  the face on this one i'm not necessarily the rest of the body uh i don't what's what's this
[13200.92s -> 13231.27s]  is somebody is it a person person is climbing on top tv sans it's voting time i know i i didn't i
[13231.27s -> 13243.62s]  cut i was too i was too much in shock what was what were you even drawing here that's supposed to be
[13243.62s -> 13252.07s]  an arm i think our painting is complete but it's still where's it going use your device to suggest
[13252.07s -> 13296.57s]  one all right um there you go i guess now vote for your favorite i don't know i don't know i
[13296.57s -> 13310.54s]  can't even man focus framework crushed by 300 pound tv time for the big reveal and the paint's
[13311.10s -> 13312.46s]  that's on an ice cream shop
[13315.29s -> 13323.13s]  just love a god all right moving on
[13326.84s -> 13344.12s]  round two and it was 400 pounds that's right there's a 450 pound television the start of some kind
[13344.12s -> 13379.18s]  of circle or maybe a um an ear that was quick uh see see see you or a face that was really quick
[13379.18s -> 13403.16s]  and it's it's the baseline here where you going with it get jexed so i need to add to this
[13404.12s -> 13426.95s]  good luck to you too make it happen uh chat chat rules and then a sans eye sans eye on the right
[13427.98s -> 13441.62s]  and then chat rules on the left and a tooth i think i think a sans eye at this point is
[13441.62s -> 13453.32s]  an automatic disqualification does that make any sense i think that breaks the rules at this point
[13463.67s -> 13471.99s]  all right so chat rules which appears chat rules all right how can i add to this let me think
[13509.86s -> 13523.98s]  it's a puppet it's a puppet or a screaming powerful spell moment of truth plus the audience
[13525.53s -> 13535.85s]  let's see pretty even actually pretty even but and then 10 shits it looks like we're going
[13535.85s -> 13546.78s]  with a puppet up next chat rules now is that supposed to be somebody that's okay so here
[13546.78s -> 13557.51s]  this is what i'm assuming here chat drools well see that the you the chat you are the the person
[13557.51s -> 13565.11s]  there right and the puppet is your avatar on the internet and you're essentially talking through
[13565.11s -> 13571.78s]  that so this this is this could be made into a very very good piece actually uh chat drools with
[13572.97s -> 13588.28s]  not no memes no like random was that
[13595.10s -> 13638.73s]  ow i know that's just a thing that that's like asking come on got it take your favorite and vote

[13658.92s -> 13674.33s]  and the audience oh yeah sure sure we made this a volunteer project instead of you know paying
[13674.33s -> 13692.33s]  anyone 23 is to do what now mr mayor i think it's time for final jeopardy final jeopardy

[13722.89s -> 13729.37s]  smoother gravy and then that would go on the tracks down to the the plant where they boxed
[13729.37s -> 13770.09s]  the gravy up so it's can i be honest i love them okay no sands good anyway sounds like upside down
[13777.08s -> 13789.24s]  that one's is that an upside down image audience all right looks like we're going
