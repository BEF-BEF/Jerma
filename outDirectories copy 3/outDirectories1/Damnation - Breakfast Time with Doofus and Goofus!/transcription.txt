[0.31s -> 19.35s]  What is extreme content? What does that mean? It's not blood or gore. Usually the blood or gore is a checkbox.
[19.35s -> 24.58s]  Watch the first scene of this game. There's gonna be tits everywhere.
[26.58s -> 27.58s]  I asked you a question.
[27.58s -> 28.58s]  I don't know.
[33.08s -> 34.08s]  Yokiken?
[37.08s -> 39.08s]  That's this person's name, Yokiken.
[39.08s -> 43.08s]  That's something that like Chung Lee would scream when she shoots a fireball.
[43.08s -> 46.08s]  Yokiken! Yokiken!
[49.08s -> 51.38s]  Holy shit!
[52.38s -> 59.29s]  This is so loud! This is the loudest thing I've ever experienced.
[60.29s -> 61.29s]  Yokiken!
[64.46s -> 67.02s]  There's only one enemy down here.
[68.02s -> 72.35s]  Does it seriously have to be this loud?
[77.69s -> 78.69s]  I told you he was gonna die.
[79.69s -> 84.53s]  Is he gonna get run over by a motorcycle too? That's been the best.
[84.53s -> 85.53s]  What?
[85.53s -> 86.53s]  What an awful shot.
[86.53s -> 90.53s]  How are you not shooting him? How are you missing that? How did you miss those three shots?
[90.53s -> 95.34s]  Shoot him! Shoot him! He's already gone!
[98.06s -> 99.30s]  Ster?
[99.30s -> 100.30s]  Yes?
[100.30s -> 103.30s]  I didn't want to be the first one to say this, but I truly think...
[103.30s -> 107.30s]  I truly think this weird agency is poisoning the water supply.
[107.30s -> 109.30s]  Oh no!
[110.66s -> 113.66s]  Where is he? Breakfast is almost served.
[113.66s -> 116.66s]  Honey! I have your favorite Pop-Tarts!
[117.66s -> 118.66s]  Pop-Tarts!
[119.66s -> 122.66s]  This is the one window in the whole game!
[122.66s -> 123.66s]  No! You broke it!
[124.66s -> 127.29s]  Did you see me trying to jump through it?
[127.29s -> 130.29s]  You fucking broke it and you messed up the joke!
[131.98s -> 135.98s]  Honey, I've got your favorite breakfast snack here waiting for you.
[135.98s -> 137.98s]  It's Pop-Tart!
[137.98s -> 138.98s]  Pop-Tart!
[138.98s -> 139.98s]  Pop-Tart!
[141.86s -> 147.25s]  Honey! You know there's Pop-Tarts down here!
[147.25s -> 149.25s]  Huh? What? Pop-Tarts?
[149.25s -> 153.97s]  You fucking idiot. Get in there!
[155.46s -> 160.46s]  You know, I've got all these breakfast toaster strudel things here. They remind me of...
[161.46s -> 163.46s]  Toaster strudel? Toaster strudel?
[164.46s -> 171.63s]  I got it in. Oh no, I didn't. It's close.
[172.81s -> 174.81s]  Alright, it's in. I got it in. I got it in the house.
[174.81s -> 177.81s]  I got it in the house. Help me.
[178.81s -> 181.81s]  I don't know what to do. I'm stuck.
[183.81s -> 186.62s]  Well, get off of it.
[190.82s -> 192.82s]  Get off of it so we can do this joke.
[192.82s -> 194.82s]  I kinda can't, dude.
[204.06s -> 206.06s]  Alright, I'm gonna get off. I'm gonna get off.
[206.06s -> 208.06s]  You got this on the second floor?
[208.06s -> 211.87s]  Honey, I have your favorite breakfast food.
[211.87s -> 212.87s]  Pop-Tart?
[212.87s -> 218.12s]  Yeah, that was so cool.
[219.12s -> 221.12s]  This is lagging so bad.
[225.56s -> 228.56s]  This game just got so much better.
[234.83s -> 240.63s]  I was riding on the walls. This is so...
[241.63s -> 244.83s]  Oh my god.
[255.84s -> 257.84s]  No, don't go. Don't go.
[259.27s -> 261.83s]  I'm dead.
[266.55s -> 268.55s]  I was dead.
[269.55s -> 272.55s]  I'm gonna burgably throw up right now.
[284.10s -> 287.62s]  Oh my god.
[288.62s -> 291.62s]  What is extreme content? What does that mean?
[294.01s -> 298.01s]  This was such a boring game. And then they added this to it.
[301.57s -> 303.57s]  Oh, you landed on the roof.
[304.57s -> 306.57s]  Watch out for this guy. I'm gonna die.
[308.57s -> 310.57s]  No, dude. What?
[312.13s -> 314.13s]  I'm dead. I'm dead.
[316.07s -> 318.07s]  Alright, here's your last chance, honey.
[318.07s -> 320.07s]  They're nice and piping hot. Pop-Tarts!
[320.07s -> 322.07s]  Please give me the Pop-Tarts.
[323.07s -> 332.48s]  Wait, mom. Mom, I need the Pop-Tarts.
[333.48s -> 339.45s]  I'm gonna use my superpowers to see where he is.
[339.45s -> 343.74s]  I'm not climbing up.
[343.74s -> 350.70s]  This is like on all those movies you watch with like the school bus is just hanging by a thread.
[350.70s -> 354.80s]  Do you see my tires spinning how much it's going?
[354.80s -> 356.80s]  I'm stuck perfectly. Like, I have no traction.
[356.80s -> 358.80s]  You cannot move at all?
[358.80s -> 363.67s]  No.
[363.67s -> 366.67s]  You cannot move this at all. This is like penis motorcycles.
[366.67s -> 370.74s]  Oh, yeah. Sure you can't.
[371.74s -> 374.74s]  No, no. Hitting the jet booster on the back kind of helps.
[375.74s -> 377.74s]  Alright, I'm done. I'm out of this fucking game.
