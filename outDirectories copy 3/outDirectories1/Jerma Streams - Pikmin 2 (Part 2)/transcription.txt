[1.53s -> 13.64s]  I was an hour late. Wait, what? I was an hour late? Where? What? No, it's just one.
[16.37s -> 18.29s]  I just had like a heart attack. I was like, wait, what are you talking about?
[19.37s -> 27.98s]  It was 1pm, right? I'm like seven minutes late. You know, Otto did the thing where he
[27.98s -> 33.70s]  walked around and smelled every smell and spun around three times, spun around three
[33.70s -> 40.93s]  times. Nope, not here. Found another place to smell. Spin around, spin around this way.
[40.93s -> 50.10s]  This is it. This is the place. No, it's not. And then finally took a fucking dump. He's
[50.10s -> 60.83s]  smelling all the smelly smells. Savory dog. I don't need to go over that again. I don't
[60.83s -> 71.16s]  need to go over that. Yeah, I'm gonna take care of Otto. Right, Otto? Oh, he needs his
[71.16s -> 106.11s]  bed in here. Okay. Show us Otto. No, I can't because I don't have any clothes on. No, no
[106.75s -> 115.41s]  cam at all. I don't have any clothing on. Fucking put them on. No, I'm not going to put on
[115.41s -> 123.35s]  clothes. You can't make me put clothes on. Okay. I am a voice inside of your head right
[123.35s -> 131.62s]  now. I'm talking to you. Just a voice. I don't have to have a body attached. Just a voice.
[136.09s -> 141.80s]  Okay. Anyways, we're gonna continue Pikmin 2. I'm having fun with it. I think it's a fun
[141.80s -> 148.50s]  game. I have a few things to tell you. One specifically, I hope I'm not jumping the gun
[148.50s -> 153.86s]  on this. Because we've just been essentially confirmed that it's probably going to happen
[153.86s -> 166.82s]  on this day. So I, I may or may not be jumping the gun. So keep that in mind. The archaeologist
[166.82s -> 179.78s]  stream is potentially like 80% confirmed to be on. Mark your calendar here. March 6th
[179.78s -> 198.57s]  of 2021. It's gonna be fun. Not cat boy. No, it is not cat boy. But I could be in a cat
[198.57s -> 205.94s]  boy outfit. I will not be in a cat boy outfit on that stream. Let me make sure I get the
[205.94s -> 215.99s]  record straight there. He's gonna find a cat boy fossil skeleton. Well, thanks for the
[215.99s -> 219.47s]  fucking free joke because there's a there's a bunch of jokes that are going to happen
[219.47s -> 224.75s]  on that stream. Thanks for another one. I credit that to you the person that just said
[224.75s -> 229.86s]  that because that would be kind of funny. Okay, I got to see if I can make that work.
[229.86s -> 239.74s]  But it should be fun. I again, I don't want to jump the gun because we've been working
[239.74s -> 244.58s]  diligently on trying to get this to happen. And over the next couple of weeks, especially
[244.58s -> 250.98s]  going to be doing a lot of stuff on it. So just to let you know, it's probably happening
[250.98s -> 256.70s]  on March 6th. I don't jump with the gun. I don't want to jump the gun. I know. I'm sorry.
[256.70s -> 260.22s]  I get on a phrase and I stay on it for like 10 minutes and then I never say that phrase
[260.26s -> 279.74s]  again. Oh, yeah. Pick me up today. Don't forget to tweet. Oh, fuck. Thank you. Thank you for
[279.74s -> 285.82s]  reminding me to open Twitter. I open Twitter like once every four days or three days or
[285.82s -> 293.06s]  something. That's a lie. What a liar. I look at it every day. Yeah, I don't even like use
[293.06s -> 299.22s]  technology. I don't even like use Twitter. That's a liar. I look at it every day, at
[299.22s -> 304.07s]  least like in the evening when I'm about to go to bed. Okay, what should we title this
[304.07s -> 313.54s]  Pikmin? Pikmin 2 continues our epic journey. I'm not going to put the last part, but you
[313.54s -> 329.09s]  get it. Let's tweet this. Why does Twitter do this shit? I don't like when Twitter does
[329.09s -> 336.00s]  that. It like it gives a link before I'm done writing. That's annoying. How dare it do
[336.00s -> 341.27s]  that? All right. Yeah, I'm into Pikmin 2. I can't say that what will happen after today,
[341.27s -> 351.75s]  but maybe I'll still be into it. Make sure I get that right. Okay. Facecam. I cannot
[351.75s -> 364.46s]  put a facecam on. You can play Yakuza again. That's the plan. Also, I don't have a date for
[364.46s -> 371.54s]  this, but the Minecraft server, the actual Germacraft Minecraft server is imminent as
[371.54s -> 384.62s]  well. It's beautiful. It is absolutely beautiful. It's a gorgeous server. So look for
[384.62s -> 389.58s]  that too soon. We'll be talking about that in detail over the next probably three or four
[389.58s -> 401.57s]  weeks. Just take a quick sip out of my bottle. Will you visit it from time to time on stream?
[401.57s -> 414.74s]  That's the plan. The plan is to visit that once a month, maybe. Maybe or so. Once every
[414.74s -> 421.22s]  couple months and go see what people are doing. Because in the last FTK stream, it was very
[421.22s -> 428.80s]  clear that the second half was way more interesting to a lot of you than the first. That's the
[428.80s -> 433.16s]  plan is to kind of do something like that. Again, I just wanted to bring this up because
[433.16s -> 439.00s]  I brought it up like maybe a month ago is the last time. Two months ago. Isn't it where we
[439.00s -> 445.08s]  talked about it last? There is no date for this, but just know that like probably within the
[445.08s -> 449.56s]  next couple of months, it will be a Germacraft server up and running that you can play on.
[450.70s -> 458.13s]  It's getting close. It's getting closer. We need a Hue cam. No, you don't need any cam. In fact,
[458.13s -> 463.21s]  I'm going to make sure like the cameras are on. I hate that knowing that that could just be turned
[463.21s -> 475.64s]  on. We already saw this. In my OBS preview, I can look over here and see that the cam is ready.
[476.36s -> 480.12s]  And the camera is physically pointing at me and the lights are on. So it's just like this shit is
[480.12s -> 490.92s]  on. The lights are just lit up, just ready to capture me naked. I'm not even naked though.
[491.64s -> 502.25s]  You know what? Here's like what I can tell you. Okay. You know how you go to sleep every night?
[503.26s -> 508.31s]  That's how I'm dressed. I have pajama pants on and no shirt. That's just what I do. That's how
[508.31s -> 523.98s]  I live every day. Pajama pants and no shirt on. That's how humans sleep. Just unplug the camera.
[523.98s -> 531.05s]  No, because then if I unplug it, I crash OBS. All right. So we left off. I had just gotten the
[531.05s -> 536.89s]  blue Pikmin. I'm very excited. Can you hear it in my voice? Yay. Can't wait to fucking play this
[536.89s -> 547.86s]  game again. I want to go here. He's bored already. I want to go because there's some water things in
[547.86s -> 564.79s]  here, right? No, wait. No, I don't. How many water Pikmin do I have? Can I see? He hates
[564.79s -> 573.02s]  it. I'm just going to go here. Whatever. I think I have enough water Pikmin. I should have like 20,
[573.02s -> 587.61s]  right? Only because they're perplexing. Boom. That you're creepy. Already said chat. You are wicked
[587.61s -> 596.97s]  creepy. All right. What do we got here? Citadel of spiders. Now there's a water thing to do here.
[596.97s -> 602.33s]  Let me just, let me take a look around first. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's get some
[602.41s -> 615.06s]  good look. All 18 of them more like wicked fucked wicked. Oh dude. I'll do that. That would be wicked
[615.06s -> 637.83s]  funny. And the electricity do 30 electric. And then we have some big boys, right? How many big
[637.83s -> 646.57s]  boys do I have? Ooh, that's not good. Only five. What happened? What happened to the big guys?
[649.54s -> 656.66s]  Stewie. Ooh, what happened to the big ones? Brian, didn't we have 20 purple pick?
[657.46s -> 663.56s]  We did Stewie, but you killed them all. No, I didn't kill them. You did. Okay. Let's go.
[664.76s -> 671.72s]  All right. Let's go over here. Everybody fucking hates family guy. You all like family guy.
[672.68s -> 678.52s]  We talked about this like two months ago. Family guy. You all hate it. Oh, shut up. I hate Stewie,
[678.52s -> 684.12s]  but you'll watch it on TBS every day. I know all of you watch adult swim and family guys on adult
[684.12s -> 690.02s]  swim. Like family guy is the teen Titans of adult swim. You watch it every time it's on.
[690.74s -> 708.98s]  No, you don't. You don't. Bridge. Okay, here we go. Uh, let's kill this guy. Only boomers.
[708.98s -> 713.94s]  Family guy literally sucks. Yeah, but it doesn't that doesn't matter. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[713.94s -> 715.14s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[715.14s -> 719.94s]  Bring everybody over here. No, just purples. Bring everybody. Fuck it. Whatever.
[720.74s -> 724.84s]  That guy's gonna jump on me. I know it. All right, let's kill all this stuff.
[730.36s -> 743.11s]  Boomers. Wait, is Adult Swim Boomer? No? I was under the impression that it wasn't. Kill it.
[743.11s -> 755.61s]  There we go. No! It kind of is. You know, maybe I am getting a little older because I turned on
[755.61s -> 762.57s]  Adult Swim recently and I thought all the shows were just fucking terrible. Is that- am I getting
[762.57s -> 772.82s]  old? Because I used to watch it all the time. They are. Okay, well hopefully this guy doesn't
[772.82s -> 779.46s]  kill me. I need the- we need to build this bridge. I'm gonna leave Louie over here in case they
[779.46s -> 789.59s]  attack. Louie, come over here. Just in case this guy attacks, I gotta be ready for it.
[793.58s -> 798.54s]  Yeah, I mean, Erica- I like Eric Andre. I think he's funny. But I don't- I don't really think
[798.54s -> 805.66s]  anything else is. Don't attack. Don't attack. Don't attack. Don't attack. Don't attack. Don't
[805.66s -> 813.03s]  attack. Don't! There's treasure here too. Oh shit. I need that because I want these guys to be-
[813.75s -> 823.83s]  Yes! All right, I'm ready to drink it. Rick and Morty Rea. Okay, all right, fine. When Rick
[823.83s -> 829.03s]  and Morty airs every three years, I guess sure you could watch it. Is he just gonna fight me?
[829.91s -> 839.40s]  Is he gonna- he is. He is. He is. He is. All right, you know what? Just kill him. Go for it.
[839.96s -> 861.51s]  We can do it. Are we gonna come back? No, come back! I'm fine. Don't crush him. I don't know what it
[861.51s -> 866.23s]  is. You know, you know you could title this video for the second channel? Because by the way, if
[866.23s -> 870.71s]  you're not subscribed to the second channel, what are you doing? What are you thinking?
[876.47s -> 890.89s]  Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill it. Kill it. I'm so afraid of him squashing. He's gonna do it.
[890.89s -> 901.08s]  Just wait for him to do it. There it is. Kill. Got it. Nice. Perfect. All right, now build a bridge.
[901.88s -> 910.70s]  You're scared of a frog? Yes. Because if it squashes them then I only have like 15 of these
[910.70s -> 919.86s]  guys. 20 of these guys. Aha! All right, good. Yeah, bring this back too. Don't go in the water,
[919.86s -> 924.95s]  go over the bridge. All right, now what's over here? There's treasure over here, right?
[925.75s -> 940.74s]  Where my white? I'm gonna dig? Wait, what? Wait, was the whole point of that to- huh. What was
[940.74s -> 948.47s]  the point of coming over here with the bridge? Can I break this? Why would there be a bridge over here?
[949.19s -> 956.47s]  I could throw yellow over there? Yeah, I could, but wouldn't they- was it just to throw yellow
[956.47s -> 967.54s]  over the bridge? They're not gonna get stuck over there, are they? I hope not. They're not gonna get
[967.54s -> 992.15s]  stuck over here, right? Are they gonna get stuck over here? They'll bring that down? Oh my god,
[992.15s -> 1007.13s]  we gotta go. What are they doing? It's all right. I'll get it. It's off locked? Well, not yet. Hold
[1007.13s -> 1016.71s]  on. Don't drown. Um, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay, okay. I'm good. I'm good.
[1017.43s -> 1027.00s]  I'm gonna sit here for a sec and then I'm gonna call these guys back. All right, now go over there
[1027.00s -> 1035.32s]  and- my mouth peaked. My mouth peaked. Did you hear that shit? That was not my microphone,
[1035.32s -> 1042.12s]  that was my mouth. I peaked the inside of my microphone, my mouth. That was fucking crazy.
[1043.46s -> 1055.80s]  Are they doing it? All right, break up for a second. All right, and then I'm gonna- so then
[1055.80s -> 1061.27s]  I'm gonna- how am I gonna get them back over here? I could throw them. I need blue to take- to pick
[1061.27s -> 1077.43s]  that up. Wait, what? Can I go over this way? I don't know, can they? I wanna- I kind of want to
[1077.51s -> 1082.50s]  hear that. The noise I've made with my mouth and my saliva or something sounded like a peaked
[1082.50s -> 1091.32s]  microphone. Throw them over? I can throw- yeah, but I don't want to touch the electric fence.
[1091.96s -> 1108.63s]  I wish I could move the camera like Mario 64. Don't I have more of these? Where are the other
[1108.63s -> 1124.73s]  blue ones? They all back at the ship? Uh, they are. Louie, go get them. Go get them, Louie.
[1124.73s -> 1145.67s]  Why is he- are they fighting him? Uh, where's the pace out there? All right, come back. Oh,
[1145.67s -> 1151.85s]  hold on. Is he playing on the Wii? I am playing on the Wii U, to be exact.
[1152.57s -> 1162.94s]  Okay, so now, anybody- any stragglers? I don't think so. I just have to go straight this way.
[1163.58s -> 1186.42s]  Wait, can I cross the bridge? Uh, no. Wait, can I? No. I won't fight him, just run. Oh, title of the
[1186.42s -> 1191.70s]  video. The title- what's the title of the video? The title of the video is gonna be Overreactor.
[1193.19s -> 1201.16s]  Pikmin Overreactor, because that's what I'm doing. I'm just like, whoa! It's like a kid's game.
[1202.12s -> 1206.39s]  Why am I, like, trying to make it sound so much more dramatic? I'm not even trying to, though. I
[1206.39s -> 1214.92s]  promise. All right, here we go. Who's dying? Oh my god! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[1217.10s -> 1227.99s]  Okay, Pikmin Overreactor. I'm sorry. I just did the exact thing that I told you. All right,
[1227.99s -> 1237.29s]  everybody relax. Come here. I only want the exact fucking thing I was talking about. All right,
[1237.37s -> 1244.07s]  can you guys get this? 15. All right, get it. Nice. The rest of you need to be thrown.
[1251.75s -> 1259.42s]  Don't pull it into the- what are you, dumb? Oh my god. All right, well, today's almost over anyways.
[1265.51s -> 1275.29s]  Pikmin Overreactor. And the thumbnail can be like a nuclear reactor. And it going off,
[1275.29s -> 1293.94s]  and it has my face kind of embedded into it going like, whoa! Oh god, perfect timing on his part.
[1294.82s -> 1308.34s]  Kill him! Oh my god. He almost just splash damage killed everybody. I'm missing anybody?
[1308.98s -> 1324.66s]  Jeremy, when are you gonna come out with a vegan burger? Um, I'm not. I'm sorry to disappoint you.
[1328.38s -> 1334.07s]  All right, hold on. These- these idiots just put five- a five blue coin into a red box.
[1334.79s -> 1343.75s]  Did they just mess that up? That's basic colors. They took the blue coin and put it in a red box.
[1343.75s -> 1360.94s]  Does that matter? Stop! It does matter, doesn't it? Pikmin carry stuff to their own onion, dummy.
[1361.91s -> 1370.36s]  That was a blue coin. Why would they do that? Can they not see blue? Can they not see the color
[1370.36s -> 1381.66s]  blue? There's a red majority carrying it. But I thought- what, what red majority cannot put the
[1381.66s -> 1394.90s]  blue coin into the blue container? Why not? All right, we'll have to remember that next time.
[1395.70s -> 1400.70s]  I'm bringing way less reds next time, by the way. They just overpower everything, and I need-
[1401.50s -> 1406.81s]  I need, like, a few more purples. Because they just keep- they pick up everything,
[1406.81s -> 1414.33s]  and they just take everything. All right, I'm good. At least I got a treasure.
[1421.69s -> 1431.59s]  Politics? Okay, well then Team Fortress 2 is politics. That's red versus blue. It's always
[1431.59s -> 1438.46s]  like fucking Halo, okay? Every video game ever that had the two contrasting red and blue colors
[1438.46s -> 1457.46s]  versus each other. They just got to get rid of the politics in those games. Base? That's not even-
[1458.02s -> 1467.35s]  That's not base? That's just- what? You just ruined all video games.
[1469.72s -> 1481.82s]  That was a flame ball back? What? I can't even believe it. 140. I keep putting a drink down in
[1481.82s -> 1490.74s]  front of my Wii sensor bar, and it keeps screwing everything up. Some say that you should look to
[1490.74s -> 1496.66s]  the past, to places you have been already, in order to make new finds. Of course, extraordinary
[1496.66s -> 1510.01s]  people like me always press onward. And scroll down, it's got one like on it. And by the way,
[1510.01s -> 1533.14s]  that's like the 30th time they've posted today. Here, go back here. In fact, you can use fire
[1533.14s -> 1543.69s]  as a Wii sensor bar. Oh yeah, sorry, you can put candles up, right? Like to own post. Boomer Twitter?
[1544.33s -> 1557.08s]  No. Yeah, and then there was one comment. It's just, are you coming over for dinner tomorrow?
[1558.31s -> 1584.06s]  It's like grandma. No, less red. I want a blue- I want a blue majority. I don't want a red
[1584.06s -> 1610.95s]  majority. Look, go ahead. You can't clip it out. He's just a psycho. Someone's going to just take
[1610.95s -> 1617.59s]  that and be like, I knew he was a Democrat. Who even cares? I don't even really fucking care.
[1618.55s -> 1624.33s]  I'm playing Pikmin 2. Does anybody actually give a shit about where I might lean politically?
[1624.33s -> 1641.75s]  Anybody even care? He's finally lost it. Okay, I don't need to bring a hundred people.
[1642.39s -> 1655.08s]  This would be good. Who needs to be- who needs to drink? Of course we do. All right,
[1655.08s -> 1659.48s]  where should I go in here? What's this place? A cavern? I got the bridge. Now what's over here?
[1660.28s -> 1676.54s]  I made that reference probably a hundred times. Oh, these are new. These are new bugs. Get them.
[1677.26s -> 1693.98s]  Didn't get a chance to eat them. Good. Okay, you know where to take that. Okay, now that's open.
[1693.98s -> 1706.34s]  Is there anything even in there besides that? It might be a secret in there. Just empty. Okay,
[1707.43s -> 1713.00s]  but I can go over here. Oh, another electric fence over there. All right, we're going to go this way.
[1714.46s -> 1751.02s]  Uh oh, here's the worst thing, the worst part about this. I want to be Louie down there.
[1751.66s -> 1759.91s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I hate this fucking thing. Why do I even put the elevator in this?
[1760.47s -> 1763.51s]  Like, I know you want to like, oh, you're way down with the big ones. Who cares?
[1764.07s -> 1773.72s]  This is stupid. I hate this. No, I don't. Stop coming with me. Stop coming with me.
[1780.68s -> 1814.25s]  Hey, kill it. Come on. Way him down. Kill it. Way it down. Oh my God. Kill it. Thank you. No,
[1814.25s -> 1819.27s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on. First, let me hit C, then one, then C,
[1819.27s -> 1824.54s]  then A, then B. Just send the other guy. Who cares? Why is this guy even in the game?
[1827.21s -> 1836.14s]  Stop doing that. I told you to stop. Oh my God. Why did you come over here? I don't. Stop picking
[1836.14s -> 1853.26s]  that up. Put it down. Go. We lost a bug. I don't care. I put Louie in this game to sell toys.
[1853.26s -> 1893.00s]  That's the only reason why he's here. Drink up. He hates Louie. What's over here? Is Louie in
[1893.00s -> 1904.79s]  Pikmin 3 as a playable character? I want to just... Yes or no? No. Okay. That's all I needed to know.
[1904.79s -> 1926.47s]  That's the only thing I need to know. Watch out. Drink it. What is... Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[1926.47s -> 1937.86s]  There's not enough here. Speaking of Louie, you go back here and go get everybody. There we go.
[1941.43s -> 1956.26s]  He's sold? By the way, why does the whistle work on people? Hold on. I'm gonna zoom out. How come
[1956.26s -> 1974.34s]  I can use the whistle on Louie? It works on you too. Yeah, I don't want the whistle to work on me.
[1974.34s -> 1977.78s]  If I'm gonna have two separate captains, I don't want the B look to be like, hey, you...
[1979.14s -> 1999.77s]  Oh my God, Nintendo. Why does every... Oh, I'm already getting mad at the fucking controls.
[1999.77s -> 2019.35s]  A is throw and A is also grab. Use the bridge. Does it not go over here? I thought the bridge
[2019.35s -> 2044.04s]  didn't go over here. All right. Everybody fucking get over here. We good? All right. Let's go.
[2044.60s -> 2058.82s]  I want yellows. Look at that great traction. Go over here. Take that down. You got killed.
[2059.46s -> 2068.63s]  You died. I just fell down here. Oh shit. I can't go back up. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go this way.
[2069.59s -> 2080.78s]  Avoid the frog. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't go over there. Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie.
[2082.01s -> 2097.06s]  Oh my God. No, no, no. Come on. You're okay. You're okay. Everyone's fine. All right. Go.
[2097.06s -> 2120.33s]  Take it down. I want Louie bait him over here. Thank God he's in the game. Thank God I have this.
[2121.29s -> 2130.42s]  Thank God I can do this. Everything I said previously, I take back completely.
[2131.06s -> 2139.78s]  There's a cave in there. Oh, okay. Cool. All right. Now come over here and weigh this thing
[2139.78s -> 2145.70s]  down so I can go up. It's almost done. Then I'm going to grab everybody and we're going to go in
[2145.70s -> 2160.02s]  the hole. I'm just distracting this, uh, Pollywog, whatever it is. Don't kill Louie.
[2163.19s -> 2171.06s]  You know what? Like, whatever. Don't jump over there. At least do a face cam. I'm not putting
[2171.06s -> 2181.86s]  on a face cam. Gooey, gooey, gooey, Louie. Yeah, that's the booger. That's the one with the boogers.
[2183.54s -> 2191.03s]  Okay. Everybody come with me. All right. We need somebody to go back and get the rest.
[2191.59s -> 2198.41s]  All right, Louie. I'll get them. No, I'll get them. All of them are. Uh, I have to go around.
[2200.44s -> 2207.80s]  Don't go up there and kill everybody, please. Okay. I need you guys to come help me knock this.
[2207.80s -> 2219.48s]  Not all of you. Oh, God damn it. Oh, God. No. What the fuck? What the fuck, man?
[2220.44s -> 2237.91s]  It's just so sad. It's fun when I can collect coins and stuff. I don't want to micromanage
[2237.91s -> 2255.72s]  5,000 fucking people. There's a treasure over here, but I don't care. I want to go in the cave.
[2256.36s -> 2265.27s]  All right. Where are we at? Where's the other team? Where's the other guy?
[2265.27s -> 2283.58s]  Okay. Over here. Can I get over there from here? Okay. Here we go. Holy shit. All right. I'm going
[2283.58s -> 2293.37s]  to get in the cave. Everybody drink? Everybody's drank. Okay. Let's go. It also doesn't help that
[2293.37s -> 2312.07s]  the whole ground looks just like I have a thousand upload right now. Strong scent. Okay.
[2314.22s -> 2324.68s]  You're both drooling. I wish just once. Is there food down here? 88 out of 88. That's good. Um,
[2324.68s -> 2343.94s]  let's do it. Let's go with the whole squad. I thought this was supposed to be a family
[2343.94s -> 2358.81s]  friendly stream. Is it? All right. What we got? I only have a few. I hope there's not a lot of
[2358.81s -> 2375.32s]  fire here. Uh, what's over there? Shit. Okay. Where's purple? Well, everybody back. Come on.
[2375.32s -> 2386.68s]  Back, back, back, back, back, back, back. He died? Why are you even over there? Oh my God.
[2387.24s -> 2397.34s]  Well, I got to, I got to turn my body and rest my arm on the stupid thing again.
[2399.35s -> 2405.45s]  Remember I'm holding out the remote like a remote control permanently. Oh, I'm already getting
[2405.45s -> 2421.32s]  annoyed by this, like upset by this. All right. I'm, I'm, my wrist is resting and I'm in a position
[2421.32s -> 2432.06s]  where the sensor bar can see it. Oh, let me see if I can do this. All right. All right. I'm good.
[2432.62s -> 2444.86s]  Give me purple. Purple, please. No, just everybody in. Everybody in. Just go overwhelm them with
[2444.86s -> 2463.66s]  overwhelming numbers. Go. Good. All right. Bring them back. I'm losing the sensor.
[2473.69s -> 2482.07s]  Only three purples are alive. That's okay. I'll get them. I'll get more. Let me move the sensor
[2482.07s -> 2498.86s]  bar to like here. Will that help? Maybe. Maybe a little. All right. Where's the treasure? Oh,
[2498.86s -> 2508.87s]  okay. It's like a glue stick. He's fucking angry. Wait, are they going to get trapped in here?
[2514.04s -> 2520.62s]  Damn. Trying to aim with this fucking thing is so hard. I feel like I'm doing surgery
[2521.26s -> 2539.35s]  to try to throw a Pikmin over a goddamn bridge and they climb. Oh, I can get out this way, right?
[2543.83s -> 2546.95s]  My grandma had an easy time using the Wii because she played for 15 minutes
[2548.39s -> 2551.91s]  once and then it sat on her shelf. She played it for like 10 minutes.
[2552.47s -> 2566.07s]  Total. She may be maybe one hour of total game time ever. Oh, that was worth a lot.
[2573.94s -> 2587.16s]  Wrong. It was a gamer grandma. What would a gamer grandma be? You're weaker than a grandma.
[2593.45s -> 2602.30s]  I don't even know what he's talking about. My forearm doesn't start to burn after 25 minutes
[2602.30s -> 2608.30s]  of holding it in the same place. I do just fine with my Wiimote. Thank you, grandson.
[2610.49s -> 2621.72s]  Lactic acid doesn't exist. It's a made up term that's a scientist made up. What is this?
[2625.96s -> 2636.58s]  Go in there? No, no, no. That's cope. I don't care. I don't care what it is.
[2638.46s -> 2642.38s]  Easy, easy, easy, easy. Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run. There's so many
[2642.38s -> 2661.93s]  weird mutant creatures in here. All right, get them. Those things are not violent. I gotta
[2661.93s -> 2679.72s]  kill this thing. It has to die. But okay, easy. He killed an innocent creature.
[2679.72s -> 2695.93s]  Now, is anything of a truly innocent? All right, let's start collecting. Where is this? Hey,
[2696.89s -> 2716.14s]  that's our fruit. He got it. He actually got it. He stole it. He stole it from us. Get away.
[2716.86s -> 2735.51s]  Don't touch that. Isn't he a Pikmin, does he? I don't think so. Okay, let's keep going. They're
[2735.51s -> 2739.43s]  just irritating. They're not really that scary. They kind of just get in the way. Is that a purple
[2739.43s -> 2773.02s]  flower? Thank God it is. Get that bottle cap. Hold on. I don't have any idea how much that
[2773.02s -> 2782.33s]  hurts to aim up there and keep it right there. I'm so glad this shit died. I'm so happy that
[2782.33s -> 2785.53s]  everyone thought we were going to go to... Oh man, motion controls are going to take over.
[2785.53s -> 2789.93s]  It's going to be what everybody... No, no, it's not. The PS5 controller is a fucking controller.
[2789.93s -> 2792.65s]  It's a regular goddamn controller. I'm so glad we didn't go from here.
[2793.45s -> 2805.29s]  What about VR? VR is completely different. VR is like your actual hands.
[2805.93s -> 2814.42s]  I'm not pointing an ice cream sandwich at a fucking red sensor. That's what this thing is.
[2814.42s -> 2817.54s]  It's a heat sensor. Whatever the hell it is. I don't know. I have no idea what this is.
[2817.54s -> 2822.02s]  It's a camera. It's a heat camera. Thermal camera. Whatever the hell it is.
[2823.99s -> 2845.30s]  Infrared. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I meant. Get this. I'm very angry today.
[2846.02s -> 2859.91s]  I'm very upset today for some reason. Why am I so angry? I'm so annoyed. I don't know why. Why?
[2859.91s -> 2864.89s]  There's no reason for me to be annoyed. Fuck this controller. Fuck this system. Fuck this whole
[2864.89s -> 2895.29s]  console. I'm just kidding. Geez. Is he stuck? Somebody said,
[2896.18s -> 2907.05s]  Frankie Wanky. I have nothing to be upset about. Shit's going real well. I don't know. Maybe it's
[2907.05s -> 2918.02s]  the whistle that's making me mad. Shut up, whistle. Isn't that making you mad? Oh, I want to go to
[2918.02s -> 2939.13s]  the flower. Who do I want to turn? I don't have any reds left, do I? Do I have any red? I might
[2939.13s -> 2967.90s]  have exactly five reds. Three. I could do a couple of blues or yellow. I'll do with yellow. Stop.
[2967.90s -> 2982.02s]  Stop. What? What? What? Laugh out loud. What? Keep the yellows? Do I do it with white then? I know.
[2982.02s -> 2992.42s]  White's pretty rare. Oh, is it red? I have red. I wish I could. I want to turn the face cam on
[2992.42s -> 2997.06s]  right now so you can see what I'm doing right now. I have both hands on the fucking Wiimote and I'm
[2997.06s -> 3002.18s]  leaning my neck down stuffed into my body like perched trying desperately hold it right here.
[3002.90s -> 3021.59s]  I don't have clothes on so I can't do that. All right, next level. Next layer. Where you going?
[3021.59s -> 3035.50s]  Get over here. You're playing here. Would I lose anybody back here? Where's the exit?
[3038.90s -> 3045.24s]  Who shows up naked? I don't have to have any clothes on. If I don't say anything,
[3045.24s -> 3054.02s]  you guys wouldn't even know. I'm just a voice in your ear. If I didn't tell you I didn't have
[3054.02s -> 3069.43s]  clothes on, some of you could have thought I was in a suit for all you knew. We got electricity.
[3071.32s -> 3078.04s]  Ooh, what do I do about that? I feel like, I don't know, is blue going to be in short supply?
[3078.84s -> 3097.26s]  How many blues am I going to have over the course of the game? You don't really need blue? Okay,
[3097.26s -> 3120.62s]  thanks for the tip. Appreciate it, guys. A is throw. A is grab. I feel like I'm...
[3125.59s -> 3146.02s]  Ooh, nectar. All right, break it. Everybody drink? Yes. Okay.
[3146.90s -> 3156.06s]  Now, let's go... All right, that's a lightning bug. Stay away. Wait, don't... I'm not risking
[3156.06s -> 3168.39s]  this. Everybody come over here. I'm going to go around with yellow. I got a white here. I don't
[3168.39s -> 3173.11s]  want that white. There we go. All right. Let's make sure this is safe first before we go any further.
[3173.83s -> 3194.58s]  How do I bet on this with draft kings? You can't. Kill him. Kill him. He's upside down.
[3195.22s -> 3218.73s]  Break his bones. Get away from me. Bugs don't have bones. Wrong. Their entire body is a bone.
[3220.33s -> 3246.84s]  Exoskeletons. Kill it. All right. We're clearing. I feel like I'm playing an MMO.
[3247.80s -> 3253.62s]  We're just clearing trash so then we can actually do the thing we want to do.
[3258.58s -> 3271.13s]  Okay. Looks good. Bingo. I didn't say wow. I said AMMO.
[3285.50s -> 3301.86s]  AMMO. AMMO. Come on. Get him. Flip him over quickly, please. AMMO. I didn't say MMO. I said
[3301.86s -> 3312.17s]  Alameo. I thought what you said was very funny. Whatever. He can have it. I don't want it. All
[3312.17s -> 3321.37s]  right. That's good. It's safe now. Is it safe? It's safe. There's a big tambourine over here.
[3321.93s -> 3330.20s]  Oh, it's not safe yet. This would have killed me later. What the fuck is that?
[3330.76s -> 3339.62s]  Oh, my God. Run. No. Come back. I got to run away. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[3339.62s -> 3347.14s]  I got to come back with Purple. Oh, my God. He's flying. He sees everybody.
[3349.29s -> 3352.57s]  Okay. We're good. We're good. We're good. I got to throw Purples at him to take him down.
[3362.25s -> 3367.02s]  I'm going to wait until he does the blow. All right. Come with me. Don't get caught in that.
[3371.96s -> 3380.55s]  Oh, my God. Everybody come back. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. We're fine.
[3381.72s -> 3384.52s]  Run, Purple. What are you doing standing there like an idiot?
[3404.38s -> 3409.16s]  Kill him. Are those spikes on his back? Am I throwing them into spikes?
[3410.04s -> 3429.59s]  Purple. No. What are you doing? He didn't die, right? Oh, thank God. Okay. We're good.
[3433.18s -> 3440.31s]  Purple. No. I don't even care if he takes them. All right. Here we go. Now I get my double treasure.
[3442.47s -> 3446.07s]  This really is an overreaction stream. I know. I don't know what I'm doing that for.
[3453.77s -> 3462.46s]  It's not a tambourine. It's not a treasure. Is your sensor bar set to a button? No,
[3462.46s -> 3478.25s]  it's set to below TV. Please take a break. It's distressing to see you. Hold on.
[3479.21s -> 3485.30s]  See this is please take a break. It's distressing to see you play when you aren't in a good mindset.
[3485.30s -> 3494.78s]  And not only does your gameplay suffer, but we do please take a break. I just started like an
[3494.78s -> 3507.22s]  hour ago. I would have to be next level baby. Or if I needed to take a break within like 20 minutes
[3507.22s -> 3510.82s]  of playing the game. Okay. At that point, it's like, it's not take a break. It's don't play the
[3510.82s -> 3525.96s]  game anymore because you don't like it. Is it necessarily take a break? Starting up a game
[3525.96s -> 3531.02s]  in 10 minutes being like, this is stupid. You got to take a break, man. Come back later. Yeah. I
[3531.02s -> 3547.98s]  think I'll take a break. It's still treasure. Where? Pick it up. Where is it? Pick it up.
[3547.98s -> 3567.91s]  Where is it? It's in the hole. Can we get in there? Can I like knock into it? Hey, wait, it's this guy.
[3568.55s -> 3617.54s]  You have something in there? Okay. And what was in his hole? What's wrong with you? I don't know.
[3617.54s -> 3623.02s]  Somebody said to kill them so I can get in. There's something in this hole. It's the wrong
[3623.02s -> 3652.76s]  one. Can I knock it? Did he actually steal a treasure and I can't get in there? To kill them
[3652.76s -> 3676.62s]  all. Um, to kill all the bugs. Holy shit. Run away. They come out for food. Um, so I have to kill a
[3676.62s -> 3705.90s]  bug over here and leave the dead body. Build the other one. Just kill the other bug. Okay. I don't
[3705.90s -> 3731.29s]  like killing these guys. They're like kind of cute and funny. I didn't like doing that. I wasn't a
[3731.29s -> 3751.93s]  fan of that. I don't want to kill them. They were not even hostile. Baste. Baste. Baste. Baste. Hello,
[3751.93s -> 3766.90s]  my name is German985 and what you just did there was totally baste. All right, we got it all?
[3767.54s -> 3783.27s]  Podcaster voice? No, it's not a podcaster voice. This is a podcaster voice.
[3792.26s -> 3798.20s]  I'll show you what a podcaster voice is. I'm going to fuck up all my settings.
[3799.00s -> 3805.69s]  So let me just hold on. I actually will mess this up and I won't be able to fix it ever again.
[3805.69s -> 3821.43s]  Hold on. Ready? Oh shit. What did I do? Hold on. I want to make sure I don't screw this up.
[3821.43s -> 3826.46s]  Okay. Here's your podcaster voice. I think I have to take a screenshot of this
[3826.46s -> 3838.52s]  because I'll fuck. All right. Hold on. Here's your podcaster voice. So today we're going to be
[3838.52s -> 3844.34s]  checking out, uh, you know, I saw this new movie. I saw infinity war and I was seriously not a fan
[3844.34s -> 3859.56s]  of it. I'm not, I'm not sure what they would think of with Thanos. I don't like him as a villain.
[3859.56s -> 3872.39s]  I was more inclined to be a happier with, um, you know, Dr. Dreadful, candy cartoon guy from
[3872.39s -> 3889.30s]  the eighties, nineties. He would have been so much more fun. Okay. Are we good? I think I'm,
[3889.30s -> 3900.76s]  am I back to normal? I hope, I hope I'm back to normal. More compressor. Hold on. I need to print
[3900.76s -> 3907.42s]  screen. I fucked it all up. Remember when I had a compressor like that on and everybody freaked out.
[3907.42s -> 3912.30s]  Everybody was so pissed off. They were like, Mike sucks. Fix your mic. What the fuck? This
[3912.30s -> 3920.54s]  sounds terrible. I'm like, I was so mad now that this is correct. This is the way it was.
[3920.54s -> 3928.55s]  Yeah, we're good. It wasn't that bad. I know it wasn't that bad, but if there's even a slight
[3928.55s -> 3942.58s]  change in audio, people think that I'm streaming from inside of a bathtub. All right. Is this also
[3942.58s -> 3954.47s]  electricity? No, there's a big bunker burger over here. Is that electric? Uh, all right. I gotta get
[3954.47s -> 3971.27s]  guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. No, he ate one. Hurry, hurry. Oh, he's eating everybody.
[3975.35s -> 4000.92s]  Shit. He got me into a corner. Uh, has Pikmin die? That's part of the game. Hundreds of Pikmin
[4000.92s -> 4005.96s]  are going to die over the course of a playthrough of this game. Like they're just dead. They're
[4005.96s -> 4035.70s]  going to die. Hundreds of them. Ooh, ice cream. Squish him. I can't go over there.
[4050.20s -> 4057.32s]  All right. This is probably going to be a buried treasure. Anything else that I've,
[4057.32s -> 4059.48s]  because I don't want to throw them over there and have all of a sudden like a
[4059.48s -> 4067.37s]  bunker burger jump over here and try to kill me. Okay. There's a coffee mug. It looks to be safe.
[4067.37s -> 4074.39s]  I think. All right. Just making sure there's nothing else that's going to kill me. All right.
[4074.39s -> 4108.78s]  Let's go. Uh, yellow going up there. If I said when I was a kid, I didn't finish the first
[4108.78s -> 4116.46s]  level in Pikmin because I didn't want any of them to die. That's so, that's so cute. That's like
[4116.46s -> 4121.69s]  absolutely adorable. What you just said. That's so cute. Like my God, you just like made my heart
[4121.69s -> 4127.75s]  turn to like, you just melted it. That's so cute. That's the cutest thing I've ever heard.
[4128.71s -> 4147.80s]  Where are they going? Why are they running over here? Remember he was 30 when he played.
[4147.80s -> 4151.80s]  So he's not, they're not going to try it. Is he going to try to steal it?
[4153.42s -> 4176.71s]  Kill him. Don't let him get it. So I have a question about the GameCube controls. How do you
[4176.71s -> 4195.51s]  throw Pikmin with the GameCube controller? It's just the C stick. All right. Let's pick up some
[4195.51s -> 4208.18s]  stuff. Go up here. Don't get stuck, man. You're going to get stuck. Come on. Is that it for the
[4208.18s -> 4220.94s]  treasure? That is. All right. Cool. Isn't great, but better than motion controls when you get used
[4220.94s -> 4226.63s]  to it. The motion controls are fine. I mean, I'm, I know I was like talking a bunch of shit and I
[4226.63s -> 4232.68s]  was, you know, making a bunch of jokes. Uh, motion controls are fine. It's, um, to be completely
[4232.68s -> 4237.88s]  honest with you, it's just like having to hold the thing out, like a remote control for a long
[4237.88s -> 4245.86s]  period. You know what they didn't make, which they should have made? They should have made a Wii arm
[4245.86s -> 4251.38s]  brace or as a device that you attach to the Wii mode and to your wrist and then anchored it to
[4251.38s -> 4267.93s]  something. Like a cushion, like an, well, Wii arm anchor cushion. Where are the other two? Uh,
[4267.93s -> 4280.79s]  there's one up here. There's the other guy back there. Bionic boomer. No, look, it doesn't, I,
[4281.51s -> 4288.60s]  the strongest man in the world could sit here with a Wiimote holding it up and his forearm would
[4288.60s -> 4292.76s]  start to get tired and it wouldn't matter. You guys would still make fun of that guy.
[4292.76s -> 4328.41s]  Where's this other one? Didn't I get him? There we go. Arty, the strongest man in the world. Yeah.
[4328.41s -> 4337.46s]  Arty, strongest man in the world. That's the best character that was on that show.
[4337.46s -> 4345.02s]  That might be the best character from any Nickelodeon show. I remember when Arty, uh,
[4345.02s -> 4352.07s]  at, for an entire episode was trying to lift up like Pete and Pete's house and he did it.
[4352.07s -> 4365.37s]  He lifted it like a 10th of an inch or something, right? Yeah. The entire episode he's sitting there
[4365.37s -> 4372.60s]  like, I will do it. I will lift up your house. And he's sitting there holding like the side of
[4373.56s -> 4392.20s]  the vinyl siding in their house. Like the whole episode. Kill. Back up. Follow me. Follow me.
[4392.20s -> 4425.06s]  Follow me. Follow me. All right. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Oh, he's going to kill them.
[4425.70s -> 4439.66s]  That's close. Take his body. All right. We got these guys to deal with too. I need one good shot.
[4440.46s -> 4457.64s]  My arm. I got it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. Throw the purples. That's
[4457.64s -> 4478.62s]  what I'm doing. Oh man. What I wouldn't give for a C-stick right now. You need to pay attention.
[4478.62s -> 4499.67s]  Don't just look at the chat. Excuse me. Don't. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. All right. We're good. Let's do
[4499.67s -> 4518.74s]  treasure hunting. Should I get Thai or pizza? I get Thai. Get Thai food. Get Thai pizza. You could
[4518.74s -> 4533.21s]  do that. A good pad Thai is, it's, you can't be beat. Pizza's pizza. Yeah. Pizza's pizza. You can
[4533.93s -> 4546.28s]  have pizza, but like pizza's pizza. I want some of you guys to get over here. In fact, all of you
[4546.28s -> 4566.46s]  get over there because I want whoever has not drank to drink. Oh, I could have just whatever.
[4566.46s -> 4579.69s]  All right. What's next? Treasure got. Treasure get. All you eat is heal. I don't. No, I don't.
[4580.33s -> 4594.84s]  Oh, fuck. This level is kind of hard. Oh, that's a good thing to do. He's always aiming over here.
[4595.40s -> 4608.06s]  I'm going to do that. Stop shooting over here. Oh, I fucking. Okay. I got to split up. I hope
[4608.06s -> 4615.42s]  it doesn't aim over here. I need just, just a couple of purples. Come with me. This purple's
[4615.42s -> 4630.58s]  very slow. Oh shit. Come on. Back, back, back, back, back, back, back. Come on. Hurry, hurry.
[4634.10s -> 4647.56s]  Oh my God. There's so many of these guys. Oh shit. Are we good? Come on. Keep going. Yes. Good job.
[4647.56s -> 4671.98s]  You did it. They will shoot only at me. Oh, okay. Now we have to deal with these guys.
[4672.62s -> 4684.52s]  I think I'm safe if I just stay right here. Yeah. I'm safe if I stay here.
[4685.32s -> 4692.62s]  That motherfucker just rolled it over here. I back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[4692.62s -> 4713.19s]  Everybody back up. Oh my God. Please. Wait. Dude, I didn't think it was going to roll that far.
[4713.19s -> 4720.31s]  I thought it was an explosion. Oh my God. I have to reset the level. I thought it was,
[4720.31s -> 4728.06s]  I didn't think it kept rolling that far. It rolled all the way down here. I lined him up.
[4729.67s -> 4735.88s]  I was trying to get away. The yellow's away. I thought it was, of course it hits this fucking edge.
[4737.00s -> 4744.78s]  Oh God damn it, man. What a pain in the ass. I could have just ran. He just killed another one.
[4744.78s -> 4762.54s]  I have to reset. I'm resetting. I'm not. No, that was in half of every Pikmin I own. Wait,
[4762.54s -> 4770.17s]  what do you mean? What do you mean? No, no, no, no, no, no. I mean reset the whole console.
[4770.17s -> 4779.24s]  That's not reset. Just turn the console off. Wait, what are you talking about? Just turn it off.
[4779.24s -> 4783.32s]  Just turn the console, just reset, turn off the console. So you're telling me if I turn off the
[4783.32s -> 4793.00s]  console right now, I'll come back and be okay. Consequences. No, not when I lose half of every
[4793.00s -> 4808.04s]  Pikmin I own. Okay. I'm turning off the game console. Here we go. I feel like this is bait.
[4808.04s -> 4829.13s]  This is bait. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. It's bait. Okay. Shit. Move out of the way.
[4829.69s -> 4838.22s]  He just crushed somebody. This fucking wee man. I have a drink in the way. Oh my god. I hate this
[4838.22s -> 4864.81s]  fucking console. It's not bait. It's not bait. Actually not bait. Okay. I'm doing it. I did it.
[4864.81s -> 4870.17s]  I just turned it off. I turned the console off. I hope, I bet, I better not be bait. I'd be really
[4870.17s -> 4894.54s]  mad if it is. Look at Samara for a sec. You want to know something funny about the Wii U? The Wii U,
[4894.54s -> 4902.07s]  I think, has a slower startup time to get from go to game, like go into game, turn on console,
[4902.07s -> 4907.03s]  then like an old hard drive from like 1998 to turn on Windows fucking 95 did. Like it's a longer
[4907.03s -> 4920.26s]  boot up time. It's a longer time to get into a game. Enter the password for your Nintendo network
[4920.26s -> 4926.26s]  ID. Oh my fucking god. Why do they even still have a network ID for Nintendo Wii U? I'm probably one
[4926.26s -> 4944.47s]  of eight people that are on the fucking network right now. All right. I'm coming back. TV only,
[4944.47s -> 4953.05s]  please. Okay. Here we go. Crying and screaming and farting. Beats to study.
[4953.05s -> 4975.94s]  Wii U. Put your strap on. Where's the brace? I want like a foam brace that I can stuck on here.
[4975.94s -> 4981.53s]  Like a, what's the thing that you, like a sniper rifle. If you're proning with a sniper rifle
[4981.53s -> 4984.17s]  and you put out that thing on the front, what's that thing called?
[4985.05s -> 4992.79s]  I want one of those for the Wii. A bipod. That's right. Exactly. That's what I want for the Wii.
[4993.51s -> 5004.42s]  Holy shit, it worked. It was, I thought it was bait the whole time too. Holy shit. Nice.
[5009.18s -> 5022.23s]  I honestly thought it was bait. Let me get comfortable again. There we go. All right.
[5022.23s -> 5035.24s]  I did blue. Does anybody else have this problem too? This might just be a me problem,
[5035.24s -> 5040.78s]  but like holding up the Wiimote and pressing A with my thumb like is after a while starts
[5040.78s -> 5047.91s]  to become like hard to do and like tiring. Did everybody else have that problem too?
[5048.55s -> 5056.95s]  I feel like the A button should have been more to the left or something. I don't know.
[5056.95s -> 5063.99s]  Let me just find every way I can complain about like a beloved console that everybody loved.
[5063.99s -> 5083.66s]  Except for me, apparently. Watch it. All right. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Move, move, move.
[5084.38s -> 5096.90s]  These guys suck. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Did we lose one? Okay. I lost one.
[5101.85s -> 5105.69s]  Stop throwing them over there. Why is he throwing them that way? That's so unfair.
[5120.28s -> 5139.64s]  Use my power up. Well, I have to fight like three of these guys. Kill that. Kill this guy. Shoot him.
[5140.44s -> 5150.42s]  Shoot this guy. Shoot this Bunger Burger guy. Shoot this. He's going to eat somebody.
[5151.85s -> 5162.15s]  Thank you. My God. Overwhelm him. Overwhelm him. He won't get to fire another shot.
[5162.95s -> 5186.73s]  Holy fuck. That was horrible. This place sucks. Reset. You lost four or three. No. Hold A. Press
[5186.73s -> 5213.14s]  B. Aim with remote control. High heat sensor bar. Oh, you motherfucker. This console. Oh, my God.
[5214.18s -> 5233.86s]  Let me shake my hand a little. They never intended anyone to play this console for more than fucking
[5233.86s -> 5253.22s]  20 minutes. They really didn't. I know they didn't. They even have a thing telling you to stand up and
[5253.22s -> 5263.00s]  take breaks every fucking 10 minutes. Like, what the hell? Remember how many times that they showed
[5263.00s -> 5267.80s]  you that screen? They were so hell bent on making sure you didn't play for more than 20 minutes in a
[5267.80s -> 5274.10s]  row. Remember, get up and stretch and don't knock over the fucking vase that's next to you. That's
[5274.10s -> 5287.96s]  right next to your couch for some reason. All right. I split this up. Scratch that. Drink that.
[5291.29s -> 5299.16s]  And then VR happened. Yeah, that's true. Watch out. There's a vase next to your dining table or
[5299.16s -> 5305.24s]  whatever or next to your couch actually turned into people putting holes in their drywall by
[5305.24s -> 5325.16s]  punching with VR. Now, a VR Pikmin that I can get into. I was going to say that killed me. I was
[5325.16s -> 5335.91s]  fucking turned off the stream. Shit. Hold on. How am I supposed to do this? All right. Everybody
[5335.91s -> 5342.78s]  back up. I'm going in here with like, okay, here's the plan. I'm going in here with just
[5342.78s -> 5357.64s]  purples and we'll go. I'm going to split this up small. Is there even treasure over here?
[5358.71s -> 5367.35s]  There is. Okay. This is this. Wait, I have an idea. Move. I went over him. Oh my fucking God.
[5368.74s -> 5384.62s]  What? This treasure. If I, I have an idea. If I stand in the way, just if I put the captains
[5384.62s -> 5396.82s]  in the way and make them get hit by the balls, they can get the treasure, right? I'll just die.
[5420.18s -> 5443.03s]  Watch out. Watch out. What's he shooting? Back up. Turn him this way. What are you shooting at? Oh,
[5443.03s -> 5467.16s]  fuck. Oh, fuck. He's almost dead. Just relax. What are you shooting? That way? All right. Kill him.
[5467.80s -> 5472.18s]  Good. Thank God. All right. There's two more. You don't have to recall them when it
[5472.18s -> 5475.46s]  tosses them. They run back towards you and the bullets just roll over them off the ramp.
[5476.26s -> 5479.22s]  I'm scared. That's scaring me shitless though. I don't know if I can handle that.
[5479.94s -> 5484.47s]  All right. There's nothing there. There's one here though. This guy's going to die over here.
[5485.43s -> 5505.80s]  Oh, no. I left one. I left one accidentally. Kill that guy. Yes. Shoot him. Shoot this guy.
[5510.47s -> 5521.38s]  You little asshole. Come here. Don't carry him. Run. What are you doing? What are you doing?
[5521.38s -> 5590.62s]  Why would you try to pick him up? Run away. All right. Collect. Collect the bounty.
[5590.62s -> 5608.76s]  Web, web dev here. What? What is web dev? What a, we you dev here. We, we, we, we you dev here.
[5608.76s -> 5612.44s]  Look, I understand my consoles and their motion controls did not revolutionize the gaming industry
[5612.44s -> 5616.68s]  the way we intended them to. But to sit here and watch you shamelessly bash my life's work,
[5616.68s -> 5620.54s]  who the fuck do you think you are? You know how many years I slaved away Nintendo to bring you
[5620.54s -> 5624.30s]  gaming experiences like this only if you stabbed me in the back by calling them garbage. You should
[5624.30s -> 5632.84s]  be ashamed. I never said that. I never said that. When did I, when did I say this was garbage? I
[5632.84s -> 5642.17s]  didn't say that. I said I want a bipod. And if, if you had a bipod that was for sale, I would have
[5642.25s -> 5659.90s]  had much better experience. Yes, I wanted it. I want a tactical Wii mode so I can just plant,
[5659.90s -> 5668.22s]  plant it on my arm, the chair of my arm, the arm of my chair and just lock it in there and rest
[5668.22s -> 5671.42s]  and have a little bit of, have like a gyro there so I can move the wrist around.
[5675.08s -> 5684.15s]  I did not say garbage. I did not. I did not say that. I know I didn't. I did not say garbage.
[5689.72s -> 5697.06s]  Let me tell you exactly what I said. I said in very direct quotes, fuck this console.
[5697.06s -> 5701.59s]  I think that's what it was. I think it was something like that, right? Now that I didn't
[5701.59s -> 5708.28s]  say this console was garbage. I just said, fuck this console and fuck this controller, right?
[5709.08s -> 5713.72s]  But that doesn't mean I don't like the game. I'm not having fun with the system.
[5714.68s -> 5733.75s]  That's worse. No, it's not. That quote was very, oh, fuck. Somebody said,
[5736.71s -> 5752.39s]  in direct quotes, I think. I know. Whatever. No, the Wii U. Alright, I can tell you right now.
[5752.39s -> 5765.26s]  I don't give a shit about the Wii U. The Wii U was fantastic. It was very good back in like 2007.
[5771.51s -> 5775.43s]  The Wii U is what they wanted the Switch so badly to be, but I guess they weren't ready to make it
[5775.43s -> 5785.08s]  yet. They took the Wii U idea and just how truly awful it was, and they made it the system they
[5785.08s -> 5800.01s]  actually wanted to make with the Switch, and it's way better. So look, I have to give Nintendo some
[5800.01s -> 5808.54s]  credit here. With the Wii U being as messy and as fucked up and weird, and I hate to say the word
[5808.54s -> 5815.29s]  bad as it was, if we didn't get the Wii U, we may not have gotten the Switch. And think of how good
[5815.29s -> 5819.21s]  the Switch is. Think about awesome. Think about how much you use the Switch. Think about awesome
[5819.21s -> 5825.11s]  that console really is. We wouldn't have gotten there without the stepping stone that was the Wii
[5825.11s -> 5847.38s]  U. Never bought a Switch. I think it's great. Switch is awesome. It's everything I've ever wanted.
[5847.38s -> 5851.75s]  Remember when the PSP came out and it was, oh my God, you're going to get PlayStation quality
[5851.75s -> 5859.18s]  graphics on the go. It was like, all right. It's okay. It was cool. I needed to go to the bathroom
[5859.18s -> 5866.09s]  console. I used to bring my entire computer in to the bathroom, and I get the Switch now. The Switch
[5866.09s -> 5873.34s]  is a full actual 3D graphics of the same caliber. And he's telling me I can die. That's my bathroom.
[5873.34s -> 5890.14s]  I can go to the bathroom with it. Best thing I've ever bought in my life. What's this ham
[5890.14s -> 5900.78s]  doing over here? Why is it like a piece of pork belly? This guy's freaking me out. What's he doing?
[5900.78s -> 5903.42s]  What are you doing? What are you doing? Get away from everybody. What are you doing? What's he
[5903.42s -> 5925.38s]  doing over here? This guy, he's freaking me out. I don't like this floor. Somebody died? This is a
[5925.38s -> 5937.66s]  very dangerous floor. Don't let him steal that. Whatever. There's a lot going on on this floor.
[5937.66s -> 5942.78s]  He's stealing a plate. Give me that. That's not for you. That's not for you. Get that from him.
[5942.78s -> 5949.30s]  That's not for you. That's not yours. That's not yours. Give it back. Don't let him take that.
[5951.35s -> 5959.13s]  Put that down. Put it down. Put that shit down. Get over here. I want that plate.
[5959.93s -> 5975.94s]  Oh, it's a piece of bologna. Meat of champions. It is. That killed him? Oh, he like touched the
[5975.94s -> 5986.54s]  beam. It fucking insta-killed him. Were you just going to take your friend? All right, you have to
[5986.54s -> 5993.66s]  die. I'm not going to deal with that this whole room. No way. It would be nice if I could fucking
[5993.66s -> 6018.89s]  land anybody on you. And the big one is freaking me out though. Oh my god. Damn it, man. I have
[6019.21s -> 6026.79s]  bracing every bone in my body to do this right now. Holding it right here, I'm using every bone in
[6026.79s -> 6047.13s]  my body. I was just holding it into my chest to make sure it wasn't moving that much. All right,
[6047.13s -> 6063.61s]  everybody get over here. Bro, what the fuck? What? Okay. Where's my other dudes? We're missing
[6063.61s -> 6072.30s]  somebody. Okay, here we go. All right, there's an egg over here. Let's get that egg. Get that over
[6072.30s -> 6075.90s]  here quickly before this guy takes it. I kind of like this level. It's like a breakfast level.
[6075.90s -> 6085.46s]  Where you going? Where they going? Down? Not where you going? And down this way. Thank you.
[6104.26s -> 6108.52s]  That looks like a pretty good egg. All right, in the chat, I want to know
[6108.52s -> 6112.04s]  over easy, over medium, or over hard. If you say anything besides over medium,
[6112.60s -> 6124.90s]  you are banned from this channel. Well, looks like we're dropping a lot of people today.
[6125.62s -> 6133.51s]  I love over over medium is perfect. Because it gives you the sort of gel,
[6133.51s -> 6145.16s]  almost gelatin like substance of the kill this guy. He's gonna steal something event. No,
[6145.16s -> 6153.00s]  I've just just get rid of the good I was doing before. Need yellow. They're not hostile. So
[6153.00s -> 6171.38s]  it's fine. Kill always over medium other 10 times actually made right. Actually over medium
[6171.38s -> 6177.51s]  is the hardest one to do. Because that's why it's the best one. Over medium is the most difficult
[6177.51s -> 6194.73s]  egg to cook. People don't get it right. What about boiled eggs? Yep. I love hard boiled eggs. But
[6194.73s -> 6201.26s]  here's the thing about hard boiled for me. I don't want soft boiled egg. I want a over medium egg,
[6201.26s -> 6205.18s]  but I don't want a soft boiled egg. And you probably be confused saying, Jeremy, isn't a
[6205.18s -> 6210.22s]  soft boiled egg exactly what you want? That is exactly an over medium style. And I'll say yes,
[6210.22s -> 6216.22s]  it is. But when it's a hard boiled egg, I want it to be solid. I don't want it to be drippy or
[6216.22s -> 6229.96s]  gooey. I want it to be solid. Read chat. What? He's stealing the treasure. Who is? I'm trying to
[6229.96s -> 6255.56s]  get rid of the electricity. I'll get it back. Somebody die. I can still get that treasure. I
[6255.56s -> 6267.08s]  just have to kill him. Yeah, but over medium is my favorite type of like that style cooked on a
[6267.08s -> 6274.81s]  skillet. Hard boiled I like it to be fully cooked all the way. I really am not a big fan of that.
[6274.81s -> 6281.13s]  So we can go scrambled eggs here. I don't I'm sorry. I don't like the scrambled egg. That's
[6281.69s -> 6285.29s]  you put it in the pan for five seconds and you stir it around and then it's done.
[6285.29s -> 6289.45s]  No, no, no, no, no. That's like porridge. It's sludge. I like my scrambled eggs to be
[6290.25s -> 6294.09s]  solid. I don't like the sludge porridge shit. I don't I really don't.
[6295.62s -> 6310.36s]  Okay, let's kill this guy. It's got to be purple. I get it. I don't think he can even
[6310.36s -> 6332.33s]  can even hurt anybody can even attack. I don't this is gonna take a while. He's not like the
[6332.33s -> 6336.01s]  caterpillar for Mario, right? Like, eventually, he's not going to freak out. So sprinting around
[6336.01s -> 6351.75s]  and killing everybody. Or if I get him down to red health and he starts to sprint around,
[6351.75s -> 6380.30s]  I'm gonna freak out. All right, split up any purple. Thank you. Where's he going?
[6380.30s -> 6399.93s]  He's walking like Squidward. What's that mean? Walking like Squidward. Dead. And he dropped a
[6399.93s -> 6411.40s]  can of milk and a donut. Oh shit, he had a lot of stuff. Processing how bizarre an item appears to
[6411.40s -> 6417.74s]  have fallen out of the freakish creature. Must have been a greedy beast to swallow something like this.
[6418.38s -> 6423.43s]  Probably. We have a lot of yeah, this is why I didn't want to stay.
[6424.31s -> 6434.06s]  Yeah, I'm good. Oh, right. Shit. We got warrior where smooth moves on the Wii.
[6435.34s -> 6439.10s]  It's like one of the best consoles. Never mind. I'm sorry. I put my drink down in front of the Wii
[6439.10s -> 6458.87s]  sense of our fuck this stupid shitty console. The donut. Get a candle. No, I will burn my whole
[6458.87s -> 6468.23s]  I'll burn my house of light. I'll burn my entire room down. I don't like candles. I love candles.
[6468.87s -> 6472.39s]  But I I'm always afraid of having a candle in multiple rooms.
[6473.78s -> 6478.79s]  Maybe some of you can level with me here. Candles great. But I know people that put candles in a
[6478.79s -> 6482.63s]  bunch of rooms. You know, there's a candle in the bedroom. There's a candle in the living room.
[6482.63s -> 6486.79s]  There's a candle lit in the kitchen. I want to be able to have an eyesight of that candle
[6486.79s -> 6491.24s]  from anywhere that I'm going to be standing for the next hour. I don't want to know candle in
[6491.24s -> 6503.14s]  a room I'm not going to be using. Absolutely not. If I cannot see that candle, it better be out.
[6506.06s -> 6508.94s]  It is far more advanced than the material I was researching. How frustrating.
[6510.84s -> 6514.12s]  Space suit made from this wonder ally could insulate the wearer from electric shocks. Oh,
[6514.12s -> 6519.18s]  cool. I could walk through electricity. The hard word to say when you're just not prepared for it.
[6519.90s -> 6530.15s]  This new material has allowed me to complete my anti-electrifier. It's my own invention with
[6530.15s -> 6538.97s]  only the smallest iota of outside inspiration. Do you burn incense with your healing bracelets?
[6540.28s -> 6546.65s]  Actually, I don't. I'm a bit I like essential oils, though, not because I think they give me
[6546.65s -> 6552.86s]  powers, but I just like the way tea tree oil smells. I just like the way tea tree smells.
[6552.86s -> 6559.35s]  I like the way eucalyptus smells. It doesn't give me powers. I just like the way it smells.
[6559.35s -> 6568.92s]  Cultist. No, I'm well aware that it doesn't do anything for me. Well, that's not true.
[6570.09s -> 6575.83s]  Tea tree is actually really good for your hair. I mean, that's a good thing. It's good for your
[6575.83s -> 6586.47s]  hair. It can relax you a little bit. It doesn't do anything. It doesn't give you powers. I mean,
[6586.47s -> 6591.43s]  that's how it starts. Okay, well, that's how it starts. Like 15 years ago, I should have gone
[6591.43s -> 6597.53s]  down like the rabbit hole. I didn't. I thought tea tree smelled good and was cool when I was like
[6597.53s -> 6617.86s]  20. I didn't progress. Sweet dreamer. Did everybody drink? You look like a greasy today.
[6621.83s -> 6630.31s]  Probably. That was pretty cool. I like the breakfast place. I didn't like the boulder bugs.
[6630.31s -> 6651.43s]  That's $1,300. You're an essential oils pyramid scheme. No, I bought a bottle of tea tree oil.
[6653.99s -> 6662.09s]  I want to say maybe seven or eight years ago that I still have it. It's still fine.
[6662.97s -> 6675.08s]  I smell it sometimes. Day's almost over. We're good. Nobody's left out. Pretty good. That's
[6675.08s -> 6690.58s]  a pretty good day. That's a pretty good day. $1,200. I signed up for this program where I get a bottle
[6690.58s -> 6696.25s]  of tea tree. I get 10 essential oil bottles delivered to my door every month. What you guys
[6696.25s -> 6701.62s]  don't understand is you could do this too. You could get it delivered to your door every month
[6701.62s -> 6705.86s]  and then you could bring 10 people in to deliver them to 10 people's houses and then those 10
[6705.86s -> 6715.64s]  people could have 10 other people and 100 people would be underneath you. Years ago
[6717.38s -> 6724.12s]  me and Burger Boy would spend a lot of time together. We were going to try to get him to
[6724.12s -> 6729.22s]  he and he wanted to do it too. We weren't trying to convince him or anything. We wanted to get him
[6729.22s -> 6734.10s]  to do one of those MLM things and see how much money he could make going around trying to sell
[6734.10s -> 6741.22s]  people's stuff. We're like, it would be funny if you just tried and he's like,
[6742.02s -> 6747.98s]  actually, yeah, maybe that would be funny. Burger Boy shows up and is like, let me ask you a question.
[6749.32s -> 6776.33s]  How's your skin care? Burger Boy ends up making $50,000 a month doing it. Wicked funny. No. A wicked
[6776.33s -> 6787.93s]  funny pyramid scheme. He didn't do it. We just like joked about it. Omar, you're my hero. You've
[6787.93s -> 6792.17s]  erased half of our debt. Still, things have become a bit dangerous. So I'm going into hiding. Focus
[6792.17s -> 6800.89s]  on work and don't slack off. What the hell are you doing? What is this? Why is the chat all hacked?
[6800.89s -> 6809.53s]  Why is the chat hacked? How are you doing that? Don't do that. Why is it hacked? Oh, what the
[6809.53s -> 6831.11s]  fuck is going on here? I don't even know what's going on over there. But no, we were just talking
[6831.11s -> 6836.87s]  about Burger Boy. Why don't you join that thing? And if you're like, I'm not fucking doing that
[6836.87s -> 6847.40s]  stupid fucking scam. Take the red pill, Jerma. I don't even know what the hell is going on.
[6847.96s -> 6867.10s]  Is this some new program? Put it in sub only. Put it in sub only quick. Don't do it. Take the blue
[6867.10s -> 6882.79s]  pill and have a nice steak. I'm going back here. Look at all this other stuff I didn't do here.
[6884.62s -> 6898.17s]  I have a good steak. He doesn't know what Unicode is. I don't know. I don't know.
[6898.97s -> 6922.49s]  Okay, what do we got? We got... Let me take a quick look. What is here? We did this. Okay,
[6922.49s -> 6926.89s]  I want more blue. What about over here? Up this way? Will we investigate what's this way?
[6927.53s -> 6930.65s]  If there's an electric fence over here, then... Fuck yeah.
[6935.59s -> 6947.50s]  Hmm. What's down there? Secret? Secret treasure? All right. There's nothing over here, Louis. I
[6947.50s -> 6951.86s]  don't care. You can stay there for the rest of the level. I don't care. There's nothing over there.
[6952.50s -> 6969.82s]  Go behind. Ooh, okay. This is nectar. Well, we actually kind of need it. Not yet, though.
[6969.82s -> 6976.15s]  So what's the thing I haven't done here? Perfect Jupiter is, yeah, pretty good.
[6976.87s -> 6992.86s]  What's up here? Don't fight this guy. Don't even need to. All right. Is it... There's a cave? I
[6992.86s -> 6998.01s]  think I've already... Did I complete this cave? I completed this cave. So we gotta go... All right.
[6998.01s -> 7001.40s]  I know where to go. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let's bring
[7002.04s -> 7007.24s]  25 blues. Let's pick... Let's spend a day collecting some Pikmin. What do you say?
[7007.80s -> 7014.01s]  It's a lot of Jupiters right now. Hey, don't you know now's your op... This is the opportunity.
[7015.10s -> 7019.26s]  Now's the opportunity, guys, to put out, like, German TV, an emote that you'll never see.
[7019.26s -> 7034.66s]  This is the opportunity to put out as many German TVs as you can put out. Well, hold on. Don't just
[7034.66s -> 7060.33s]  start doing that. And we'll do some red. Let's see. 15 red and purple. We got now some white
[7060.33s -> 7070.63s]  and then the rest will do blue. No, yellow. 30 yellow. And that leaves us with... Oh, get some
[7070.63s -> 7084.15s]  red, too. Why not? First of all, I need blue. Blue, go get this. We need more of you. Put it
[7084.15s -> 7091.77s]  in your thing. I need blue. There's a couple more flowers over here. I'm just doing some
[7091.77s -> 7102.65s]  Pikmin collection. I'm doing some Pikmin utility here. OK, grab that. That's blue.
[7106.70s -> 7122.15s]  Grab this one, too. Blue. Thank you. We're on 10-year slow mode. Go ahead and get it.
[7123.03s -> 7133.54s]  Go on. Bring it to blue. Did I take a break yet? No, I haven't. We'll probably take a first break
[7133.54s -> 7146.70s]  here in a little bit. After this level, I will. You literally won't. Why do you think I'm not
[7146.70s -> 7162.47s]  going to take a break? No break. No, don't bring that over to yellow. What are you dumb?
[7166.87s -> 7181.06s]  $25,000 slow mode. OK, now we can take the whole crew. I now have 100.
[7189.05s -> 7200.41s]  Somebody get that. Whatever. Just get one more. Just put it in blue. 99 out of 100. Where's the
[7200.41s -> 7222.38s]  last 100? Where's the last guy? Wait. Nectar. Where is it? This way, right? Yeah. Stop what?
[7224.15s -> 7232.90s]  The stream fucking sucks. Get out of here. Give me a break. Get out of here.
[7236.26s -> 7248.55s]  Come on, dude. Like, what the fuck? All right, let's go. Get him out of here.
[7253.37s -> 7259.45s]  This is worst stream 2021. Get out of here. Truly get out of here. That's bullshit. No, it's not.
[7268.12s -> 7282.78s]  OK. Water. Yes. Catboy will be worst stream 2021? No, it will not. What are you smoking?
[7283.42s -> 7288.39s]  You have no idea what I'm going to do for the catboy stream. And I'm sorry for all some of you
[7288.39s -> 7292.63s]  might be new here, but if you think I'm just going to put on cat ears and like eye makeup,
[7292.63s -> 7296.63s]  you are out of your fucking mind. You think that's what I'm going to do for that stream?
[7297.27s -> 7315.72s]  I would just hold on a minute. I was going to put cat ears on, put on like a little bit of
[7316.36s -> 7344.52s]  eyeliner. You must not have been here for very long. What we do here, get a competing dog boy.
[7345.48s -> 7358.28s]  That's fucking funny. I'll tell you, I'll be very, very honest. That's going to be a very
[7358.28s -> 7369.90s]  elaborate stream. It's not just going to be me with cat ears. And speaking of big streams,
[7370.54s -> 7379.69s]  maybe we'll see you on March 6th for the archaeology stream. Maybe you learn a few things.
[7385.22s -> 7397.00s]  OK, so now I've got to put the bridge out or bridge up. Can I do this with just blue? Good
[7397.00s -> 7408.73s]  kill. Good kill. Kill. Do March 5th. It's my birthday. No, I'm sorry. You just pretend like
[7408.73s -> 7418.70s]  it's your birthday on the 6th. All right. There's a scary guy over here. Is he fire? He's not. It's
[7418.70s -> 7427.58s]  one of these. Oh my. It's targeting me. It's homing missile. Why is it still spinning? What the fuck is
[7427.58s -> 7453.27s]  this doing? Get out of here. Get out of here. Come on. Hurry run past it. I'm not trying to fight.
[7453.27s -> 7456.39s]  I'm just trying to put the bridge. I don't want to get in a fight. Leave me alone.
[7458.18s -> 7474.18s]  Yeah, I might have to fight this guy. All right. Kill him. We might lose one. It's all right. OK,
[7474.18s -> 7484.26s]  we're good. Get away from me. Don't even think about coming over here. Come on, guys. Get it.
[7487.37s -> 7491.61s]  Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.
[7491.61s -> 7506.15s]  Oh, that almost. I almost lost it at the end. All right. We've got to come kill these guys. I need
[7506.15s -> 7514.71s]  fire. Good job. All right. We are now ready to bring everybody here. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.
[7533.02s -> 7559.82s]  OK, fire. What happened to Louie? Kill. You're immune to fire. Kill it. OK, now we need purple.
[7559.82s -> 7571.94s]  The rest can come over here, actually. One hundred. Nobody died. Good. This is where it gets a little
[7571.94s -> 7604.68s]  intense. And holy shit, I could have been really bad. Why is it curving? Why are they curving? Why
[7604.68s -> 7619.48s]  are they curving? Why is it curving? They're homing. That's unbelievable. I'm trying to get
[7619.48s -> 7625.74s]  out of the way. What? When does it hit? Just run. I don't even care. What a stupid enemy.
[7626.46s -> 7663.42s]  Is it fire? Oh my God. Get him down. What? It's already midnight? Can I get up there? How do I
[7663.42s -> 7693.00s]  get up here? Oh, bridge. Stop bringing that back. All right. I got 88. Let's go. Another cave
[7693.00s -> 7699.91s]  discovered. Venturing to the farthest reaches has proven rewarding. You may be tired of walking,
[7699.91s -> 7716.94s]  but just one last leap remains now to get that treasure. I don't have enough. I don't have any
[7716.94s -> 7724.41s]  white. Do I even have any white? All right. We're coming back here and getting that crown tomorrow.
[7724.41s -> 7737.83s]  How many white do I have? I'm going to try it. How many white do I have? I only have three
[7737.83s -> 7751.83s]  white Pikmin. I think we're safe for non-subs to come back. Bring them back. Let's see if they'll
[7751.83s -> 7769.80s]  behave. All right. Where are we? There's purple. Snow. Who do I want to replace for purple?
[7770.68s -> 7778.50s]  Everybody line up. What have we got? I have a lot of blue. I think I'm going to do blue.
[7780.09s -> 7794.52s]  This might be a mistake. This cave's scary. This cave sucks. This cave's hard. Well,
[7795.32s -> 7806.71s]  let's see if I get wiped. Here comes a difficulty chat. Difficulty spike. Damn it. Really? Well,
[7806.71s -> 7830.36s]  all right. We're just going in. What is that thing? Kill it. Crush it. No, no, no, no, no,
[7830.36s -> 7833.40s]  no, no, no, no. Run, run, run, run, run, run. I didn't know what that was. I didn't know what
[7833.40s -> 7856.01s]  that was. I didn't know what that was. I thought it was a snowball. All right. Whatever.
[7856.81s -> 7859.77s]  I didn't know what that thing was. I thought it was a snowball.
[7861.90s -> 7867.70s]  They got me. They baited me. This game is so bad. I can't believe anyone would even
[7867.70s -> 7871.96s]  play this for more than a minute. This is a beloved Nintendo franchise. This is the worst
[7871.96s -> 7879.64s]  game I've ever played. This is worse than Big Rigs. I'm sorry. That's going to be taken out
[7879.64s -> 7888.86s]  of context like everything I fucking say. Watch out. Don't get caught in the cast.
[7889.66s -> 7897.16s]  That's just Attack on Titan again. I think that's funny, but I have to stop doing that.
[7898.78s -> 7901.50s]  There's going to be a huge Pikmin fan that's going to see that and be like,
[7901.50s -> 7907.06s]  why did he hate it so much? Why is he such a dick? I don't understand. Why would he be like that?
[7907.86s -> 7944.82s]  OK, I'm back. You ate one. You fucking ate one. Crush him. Overwhelm him. All right. He lost his.
[7948.60s -> 7965.46s]  These corridors are so tight. It's the corridors are so small. All right. This buried treasure
[7965.46s -> 7982.06s]  here. I hope I have a white Pikmin to dig this. I do. I'll get it. You know,
[7982.06s -> 7986.54s]  I wish if when I pressed C to go to Louie, I didn't. I wasn't still attached to everybody.
[7987.10s -> 7997.21s]  It's kind of annoying. I just want to be Louie. I don't want to be Louie and bring the whole crew.
[7998.01s -> 8024.68s]  All right. Get that diamond. Nice. The third game fixes that. This boss killed my entire
[8024.68s -> 8038.41s]  squad. Good luck. Great. That doesn't sound good. Only 70 for a Ruby. There's a noob in the chat.
[8038.41s -> 8058.92s]  Oh, please. Noob. This game's not easy. This game's not easy. Don't let anybody tell you that.
[8058.92s -> 8083.42s]  It is. It's pretty easy. Is it? This game was made for children. This game was made for children
[8083.42s -> 8091.06s]  like 15 years ago. It's different. They made children's games hard 15, 20 years ago.
[8091.70s -> 8112.86s]  So if Pikmin were to be made now, there would be a Pikmin generator that I would just go to
[8112.86s -> 8127.50s]  the pause menu and just spawn another red Pikmin as many as I wanted. You think Nintendo would not
[8127.50s -> 8132.62s]  put that in nowadays? If you lose the same Mario level three or four times, it will beat the game
[8132.62s -> 8148.87s]  for you. You don't think there'll be a Pikmin generator in the menu in 2020, 2021? Further into
[8148.87s -> 8167.94s]  the depths. Easy. Our game is so easy. I didn't say that. I still have trouble. I would say,
[8167.94s -> 8175.43s]  look, I've been Louie, dude, plenty of times in the new games. You want to know why I've never
[8175.43s -> 8180.39s]  played Super Mario 3D World, really, or Super Mario New Mario Brothers Wii, whatever? A lot
[8180.39s -> 8184.25s]  of people have said, oh, you should play that. Because I know for a fact that I'm going to get
[8184.25s -> 8190.41s]  Luigi'd a bunch of times and it's going to be Omega Lels in the chat. Louie-jied. Bad streamer.
[8190.41s -> 8195.37s]  Louie-jied again. I know it's going to happen. So that's why I'm just like, I don't want to play
[8195.37s -> 8199.85s]  that. I'm scared to play it. I'm scared to get Louie-jied more than the quota that I'm allowed
[8199.85s -> 8211.53s]  of, like three. Okay. This level sucks. Okay. What do I do about this? I'm going to wake this
[8211.53s -> 8218.01s]  guy up. Can I get them to shoot each other? I'm going to try this. I'm going to do a tactic here.
[8222.20s -> 8227.66s]  Everybody stay back here with me and Louie. Don't come in here. No, he's going to shoot
[8227.66s -> 8233.35s]  it right down this lane and kill everybody. Oh, my God. He actually did it. No, he didn't. All
[8233.35s -> 8236.95s]  right. Just go, go, go, go, go. Run, run. Why are you still with me? I just, I didn't see. Get out
[8236.95s -> 8267.74s]  of here. Shoot him. Good. Do it again. Good. It worked. Now shoot each other. Oh, damn it. All
[8267.74s -> 8290.41s]  right. Come on. Get him. Get him. Yes. Yes. Wrap it back around. All right. Now kill him. Good.
[8290.41s -> 8308.41s]  Now come this way. Let him shoot. Damn it. I got to spin him around. Punch with A. Yeah,
[8308.41s -> 8325.10s]  I do like no damage. I need to move this out of the way. Punch him to death. I guess like.
[8331.98s -> 8340.63s]  I'm fine. He's going to. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I ain't going to have this happen.
[8341.59s -> 8350.06s]  Fuck. This is a horrible position to be in. All right. Here we go. I'm going to let him
[8350.06s -> 8391.42s]  walk away. There we go. Thank you. Now I'll be able to get him. Turn this way. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[8392.06s -> 8419.02s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. Don't let him eat you. Yes. What is that? Is that from something? All right. It's
[8419.02s -> 8433.16s]  now safe. It's Captain Falcon. Yeah. Yes. It is. Okay. That's just curious. All right. Get the
[8433.16s -> 8474.49s]  spoils of war. Come on. Soundboard. F-Zero GX on stream. I don't understand F-Zero. I just don't.
[8475.99s -> 8481.99s]  Everybody talks so highly of F-Zero. F-Zero. Oh my God. F-Zero. Captain Falcon is so cool.
[8483.27s -> 8492.58s]  Nobody actually cares about that game. Like why don't they make one? Why does anybody? I feel
[8492.58s -> 8496.34s]  like people talk so highly of like Captain Falcon and F-Zero, but I don't think anybody plays it.
[8497.22s -> 8506.55s]  And they like won't make a new game or anything. It's not even nostalgia. It's like a new
[8506.55s -> 8515.24s]  generation of like kids think he's cool. He is cool. He's really cool. Why don't they just
[8515.24s -> 8519.50s]  make another one? Oh, it doesn't need to be a racing game. Make like a Captain Falcon adventure
[8519.50s -> 8522.70s]  game where you walk around and punch people and stuff. Like people would eat that up like crazy.
[8523.34s -> 8549.58s]  Do I not have enough to get this? Shit. Is it yellow back here? I think there's enough yellow.
[8549.58s -> 8573.93s]  Yeah. Oh, there's a ramp here. I literally was blending in with the ground. I couldn't see it.
[8574.65s -> 8603.64s]  It's a present too. The football. Oh, the Super Bowl is on. Oh. Oh, I don't know. A Super Bowl.
[8608.68s -> 8616.87s]  Welcome to the Super Bowl. It's me, John Madden.
[8628.71s -> 8648.01s]  It's like I'm there. Is that all the treasure? Yeah. All right. Who is it going to win? Hey,
[8648.73s -> 8651.93s]  no, I won't be. I definitely won't be alive when the Super Bowl is over. I was going to
[8651.93s -> 8656.18s]  do a prediction for it, but I'm not going to be live when the Super Bowl is ending.
[8656.90s -> 8668.92s]  So it'll be wasted points. Okay. Let's assess what's going on here. There is a white flower.
[8670.49s -> 8676.92s]  Good thing there's a white flower. I need to replace. Hmm. I don't know. It seems yellow
[8676.92s -> 8685.24s]  probably, right? I don't know. I have an equal amount of pretty much everybody. Don't get it yet.
[8685.24s -> 8695.94s]  Do it at the end. Okay. Well, we have fire. Let's get rid of the fire. I'm going to say,
[8695.94s -> 8702.57s]  all right, we've got multiple things to deal with here. Louis, Louis, you take fire and you,
[8703.37s -> 8706.57s]  you know what? You know what else I don't like about this video game? Walking into
[8706.57s -> 8714.87s]  Pikmin collects them. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Okay. And then I'll let.
[8718.50s -> 8723.38s]  What are they doing over here? Oh my God. Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
[8723.38s -> 8728.18s]  run, run. Don't fight. Run. I hope there's nothing in this. I picked the one hallway.
[8728.18s -> 8744.95s]  They didn't have anything. Okay. Turn around and get them. Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[8745.67s -> 8750.36s]  Get back here. Quick. They're blocked. Oh my God. You're being blocked.
[8755.05s -> 8763.42s]  Fucking land on them. Oh my God. We just saw that. They were dead.
[8767.30s -> 8780.10s]  Gee, is there anybody still alive in his ass? Like what the fuck? That was so all right. That
[8780.10s -> 8790.18s]  was horrible. Okay. We're good. That was horrible. They just, they were pursuing us. They came for us.
[8792.06s -> 8800.94s]  I don't, I hate those ones. They actually actively come get you. 120. That was inside of his
[8801.58s -> 8812.10s]  danger chime. Okay. 66 though. Okay. So what was I doing? Right. I was in the middle of trying to
[8812.10s -> 8820.28s]  plan my, what I was going to do. So let's blurt it out. I'm going to take electricity with Olimar.
[8822.87s -> 8832.90s]  Okay. Electric Olimar. Louie, you, Louie, you need to spread these guys out and get red.
[8832.90s -> 8843.38s]  I'm like right next to the microphone. I'm sorry. Okay. Olimar, yellow. All right. It's time.
[8844.10s -> 8855.30s]  Fire first. Louie, go. My, my elbow is red. I need one of those bionic arms. Oh shit. Here comes like
[8855.30s -> 8880.89s]  another invasion. Get out of here. What happened? A confused Bulborb has fallen in with the Pikmin.
[8880.89s -> 8885.51s]  They appear to be, to coexist peacefully. Wait, what? Did I just kill one for no reason?
[8887.45s -> 8891.61s]  Strange. This Bulborb has a leaf sprouting from its spine, much like the leaf on a Pikmin's head.
[8893.94s -> 8904.82s]  Oh, I would, they wouldn't friendly. Well, oh no, that was a leader. That was a big one.
[8907.77s -> 8919.50s]  I love the little Bulborbs. I love them so much. I love them. They're my favorite. They must be
[8919.50s -> 8926.68s]  protected at all costs. Okay. Yellow. Let's go up here and just do this. This gas up there.
[8937.38s -> 8959.50s]  Tack. Kill everything. Excellent. Excellent. They can't die. Really? All right. And there's the way
[8959.50s -> 8966.81s]  to go down lower. Don't want to do that yet. I do appreciate the haunted house exit though. I do.
[8966.81s -> 8973.21s]  Just in case you don't want to do it. The guy that's standing at the door and like in the,
[8973.21s -> 8978.65s]  in the black jumpsuit that it's like all the screaming, crying kids run out that way before
[8978.65s -> 8985.58s]  the really scary stuff. I'm really glad it's there. By the way, just want to let you know,
[8986.38s -> 8992.94s]  I have had to use the escape haunted house exit one time in my whole life.
[8994.31s -> 9001.51s]  And all I remember was crying buried into my father's chest while he was holding me.
[9001.51s -> 9009.51s]  I was like probably six or seven. I was crying and just seeing the guy go right this way,
[9009.51s -> 9015.75s]  right this way. And we just went outside into the air. That's all I remember.
[9016.39s -> 9024.42s]  I don't remember anything else. Okay. Electricity all gone. It is. All right. We need the gas.
[9025.06s -> 9052.50s]  Okay. Everybody stay. I need more white. No. Fuck the Wiimote. Get it.
[9056.46s -> 9061.75s]  Put the Bulbman in the white flower. No way. Can I take them out to the surface?
[9062.31s -> 9069.98s]  If I can take them to the surface, I'm not going to do that. I can't take them out to the surface.
[9069.98s -> 9080.87s]  What? Oh, come on now. Really? That's really unfortunate. That's horrible.
[9081.59s -> 9088.60s]  All right. Let's go get everybody. We're ready to move. The fire is up there, but I don't need
[9088.60s -> 9097.83s]  unless there's a hidden one somewhere. They're immune to everything. Is there? Let's see.
[9098.55s -> 9113.42s]  Just use them while you have them. Okay. Was it a pen? Oh, it's a candle. There actually is.
[9114.58s -> 9135.83s]  There is something buried. Okay. We got to get it. Everybody come over here. Okay. So I should
[9135.83s -> 9146.98s]  throw the Bulbasaur in there. Use them while I have them. Don't. I'm seeing a lot of conflicting
[9146.98s -> 9177.03s]  data here. They're invincible. Don't. Okay. Well, then I'm going to throw blue. Okay. 76. Let's go.
[9177.67s -> 9209.70s]  Can they drink the nectar? Oh, wait. We good? Okay. We're good. Take the cupcakes. Those bugs
[9209.70s -> 9217.03s]  freak out. Yeah, they do. All right. It's time to go and try to find this one that's buried.
[9221.67s -> 9228.09s]  Money, money, money. Butter, butter, butter fills the bowl. We're making us a cake that you've never
[9228.09s -> 9234.42s]  seen before. We're making us a cake that you've never seen before. Heat up the oven. Now we're on
[9234.42s -> 9241.00s]  a roll. Heat up the oven. Now on a roll. Cheep, cheep, cheep is the name of your soul. Cheep,
[9241.00s -> 9260.54s]  cheep, cheep. Where's this last one? And it's buried. Where is it buried? It's buried over here.
[9261.26s -> 9272.52s]  Thanks for joining me, everybody. Hope you're having a good day. Hope you're having a Sunday.
[9272.52s -> 9278.94s]  Super Bowl Sunday. Hope you got yourself a slice of pizza and a big Subway Sub. The big ones. The
[9278.94s -> 9289.66s]  comically large ones. Oh, I don't like Subway. Subway's terrible. Whatever. A chain that you like.
[9290.30s -> 9305.75s]  Ooh, this would be worth a lot. Get that treasure. Stop saying dumbass things.
[9307.62s -> 9318.02s]  Um, I'm pretty much like 90% sure that at least half the time that I open my mouth on this stream
[9318.02s -> 9323.38s]  it's to say a dumbass thing. So if you don't like that kind of content, I suggest you go watch the
[9323.38s -> 9344.92s]  Super Bowl. That's on right now. Don't you know it's 50% stuff that you say in the shower when
[9344.92s -> 9365.00s]  you know no one's listening to you. 25% interesting true statements. And then like 20% noises. That's
[9365.08s -> 9371.51s]  kind of how the stream works. I'm here for the true. Yeah, I got to give myself some credit,
[9371.51s -> 9374.71s]  you know. Okay. Yeah. You're here for like 20% like interesting statements.
[9376.36s -> 9385.43s]  I got to give myself at least 20%. Wait, whoa, whoa. What did I just do? What happened? I went
[9385.43s -> 9404.04s]  out. I went out the Halloween exit. Oh no. Shit. Should I reset it? Oh, come on. I just was ready.
[9404.84s -> 9419.32s]  No, I can't. I don't. What the fuck? Oh no. I'll just go back and do it again. I made a lot of
[9419.32s -> 9431.66s]  money. Whatever. You can go back. I can go back tomorrow. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Don't worry,
[9431.66s -> 9443.00s]  son. It was just some men in costumes. I am now. I whatever. I fucked up. I'm done with that. I'll
[9443.00s -> 9458.52s]  go back tomorrow. He didn't like the way he screamed at me. I had four seconds to hit B.
[9460.73s -> 9464.57s]  It's okay. It's okay. We're going to go to McDonald's. We're going to go to McDonald's.
[9468.20s -> 9477.24s]  Is that what you want? You want to go to McDonald's? Yes. Of course you do. And I
[9477.24s -> 9491.13s]  want a large fry. Okay. You can have a large fry. Okay. And then because it's Halloween,
[9491.77s -> 9495.78s]  the McDonald's employees are just kind of having fun. And we pull up to the fucking
[9495.78s -> 9500.10s]  drive-thru and this guy in a scary mask that's just like, hello. Here you go. Thanks for coming
[9500.10s -> 9509.13s]  to McDonald's. Oh shit. No, no, no, no, no. It's okay. It's okay. That's just a scary guy in a
[9509.13s -> 9515.77s]  costume. It's okay. We'll go to Dairy Queen. We'll go to Dairy Queen right now. We will? Yeah.
[9526.14s -> 9534.02s]  It's a scary guy in a costume. No, no, no. I meant like a guy that was scary because he was in the
[9534.02s -> 9541.06s]  costume. Not a guy that was scary because whatever. Hello. I'm still on the, I am still on
[9541.78s -> 9551.98s]  the I am from debt collectors. Well, the time being still on the lamb. What does that mean?
[9552.06s -> 9563.83s]  Still on the lamb. On the lamb. L-A-M is it, is it, is it not B? What is L-A-M's? What is that?
[9563.83s -> 9571.30s]  I don't know what that is. L-A-M-B is like lamb. Lamb. I've never heard that presented that way.
[9573.03s -> 9578.01s]  Lamb. To hit someone hard. To attack someone. Shit. I didn't know that.
[9593.94s -> 9607.10s]  I can go back there and the, the, yeah, I'm going back here. Yeah. I wish you were my dad. No,
[9607.10s -> 9616.74s]  you do not. It would be, you would not like me as your dad. You would be listening to this from the
[9616.74s -> 9624.06s]  other room and be incredibly embarrassed. You would have friends over and you'd be doing whatever
[9624.06s -> 9627.26s]  you're doing, hanging out in your room and you would hear like, oh, look at me. Oh, the wee,
[9627.26s -> 9631.98s]  yes, a piece of shit. This thing sucks. Fuck you. You'd hear that and you'd be like embarrassing to
[9631.98s -> 9640.36s]  have friends over. You would make sure that on stream days you were far away from this house.
[9642.39s -> 9645.67s]  I'm not sure you would like that. Okay. So now I'm going to go back to that cave.
[9650.39s -> 9667.02s]  My dad's a streamer. You know, I'm actually kind of surprised that like Nickelodeon or the Disney
[9667.02s -> 9674.02s]  channel has not done that. Like my dad, the streamer. And they play like the, the handful
[9674.02s -> 9679.54s]  of guitar riffs before the intro starts. And the person sits down there like, oh man, it's so crazy
[9679.54s -> 9687.34s]  living in this house. And they introduce all the characters. My dad, the streamer is just, you'll
[9687.34s -> 9694.86s]  see. It'll happen. They did that with iCarly. Yeah. But I'm, that's not my dad, the streamer.
[9694.86s -> 9714.58s]  That's iCarly. Wait, in our, was iCarly's dad a streamer? My dad's a VTuber. My dad, the VTuber.
[9721.22s -> 9726.81s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It would be like my digital family. And they all have their
[9726.81s -> 9739.11s]  own little like avatars. That's real. What do you mean that's real? That's, that's, that Disney
[9739.11s -> 9752.31s]  channel has that. There's a VTuber family. That's a TV. What? Okay. I have to play the game. I got
[9752.31s -> 9762.63s]  to, I gotta go. That's an actual show? There's treasure somewhere over here. Where is it?
[9765.13s -> 9776.41s]  Dude, dude, dude, there's treasure here. Dude, it's up there, I think. I'm gonna throw some whites up
[9776.41s -> 9801.00s]  there. It spreads. Dude, it's definitely right there. Oh, nice. What is it? We'll dig it out
[9801.00s -> 9816.63s]  already. My dad, the VTuber. Oh, onion, onion ring. He made mustard cheese dip. That sounds
[9816.63s -> 9826.41s]  actually pretty good. Don't. They're gonna go in the water. You see that? Okay. Well, good thing I
[9826.41s -> 9838.55s]  caught that. Come this way. The great reveal. Uh, that was supposed to be very scary, but
[9839.19s -> 9856.58s]  I, uh, and now I know it's there. I just, I just think of Donkey Kong. All right. I need, um,
[9856.58s -> 9867.56s]  purples. That's not Toad. That's the bird from Donkey Kong. Come on up. Show yourself. He's like
[9867.56s -> 9885.18s]  right here. There you are. Oh, he ate a poison one. Good. That's good. Watch out. It's okay. All
[9885.18s -> 9905.78s]  right. Get off. Get back up. Where is he? No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop eating them. Why is nobody
[9905.78s -> 9921.30s]  attaching to him? Why? I, what the fuck is going on? How am I missing? I can't reach him from here
[9921.30s -> 9932.71s]  then. God, this Wiimote. I seriously feel like somebody's strangling me right now with their
[9932.71s -> 9944.86s]  hands around my neck, trying to aim this. I can't even, nobody can even reach there.
[9945.58s -> 9952.23s]  Nobody can actually, I can't throw anybody over there. Aim for the head. I'm trying to hold on.
[9957.43s -> 9959.11s]  Let me, let me aim over there. Hold on.
[9977.27s -> 9992.86s]  Dad, dad, shut up. I got a girl over. I have like, I suppose I'm getting ready for prom,
[9992.86s -> 10001.53s]  dad. What the fuck? Stop, please. Please don't do this right now. He just hit me through the wall.
[10013.43s -> 10018.47s]  Oh my God. Maybe I'm going to lean in. Oh wow. She looked, I'm going to have my first kiss.
[10019.11s -> 10022.15s]  What the heck? Oh my God. My heart is going crazy.
[10026.71s -> 10032.23s]  What was that? What was that? Do you hear that? I don't know. No, I don't know. I must have dropped
[10032.23s -> 10059.03s]  something on his foot. My dad, the streamer. I need to give you a kid to talk, like on stream
[10059.75s -> 10081.83s]  for content. That's not, that would be not okay. That would be terrible. I want some more blues.
[10081.83s -> 10087.75s]  I don't have like any blues, do I? All the blues died. All right. Put back some yellows. I have
[10087.75s -> 10101.96s]  way too many yellows. It's educational. What are you talking about? Oh fuck. I don't have any blue
[10101.96s -> 10108.34s]  left. That's not good. That's really bad actually. Oh, okay. Well,
[10119.02s -> 10119.82s]  ding, ding, ding, ding.
[10123.42s -> 10126.62s]  There you go. That's how every single one of those shows starts. It goes,
[10139.98s -> 10153.67s]  and then there's like a chorus. What was the one that was, is it,
[10153.75s -> 10157.11s]  did you have to take some time to realize.
[10159.43s -> 10169.45s]  That hurts. What was that one? Drake and Josh did that one. That just hurt me. Fuck. My voice
[10169.45s -> 10181.08s]  hurts. What the hell? And if you don't know, you know, you should never know where nobody's down.
[10181.08s -> 10189.88s]  Yeah, I remember that one. Remember the episode where they like make the tree house and they get
[10189.88s -> 10193.72s]  stuck in it because they didn't put a door on it and then like drew a door on it. Remember I said
[10193.72s -> 10201.06s]  that was like a funny routine and I accidentally stole it from Drake and Josh. Oh, how many white
[10211.77s -> 10219.50s]  shoot that again. I actually shoot it again. Come over here. Fire that at me. Fire.
[10222.63s -> 10237.14s]  Okay. I was going to say it attaches to me, right? Come on, kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Oh, you punk.
[10238.20s -> 10245.00s]  Oh my God. That was dangerous. This is a horrible idea. This is a horrible idea and he's going to
[10245.00s -> 10256.86s]  kill everybody over there. Isn't he? Please don't. Okay. We're fine. I need blue to pick that up
[10256.86s -> 10271.34s]  after we get rid of this guy. Shit. Do not please. Do not bring that back yet. What are you doing
[10271.34s -> 10275.58s]  over here? Stop doing that. Nobody fucking move. What are you thinking? All of you. What's wrong
[10275.58s -> 10298.57s]  with you? They're not going to get this in time. Why are they going? I could fart on them. I don't
[10298.57s -> 10318.82s]  think it'll do it though. I'll try. All right. Fart. All right. Go. But he died. That one just
[10318.82s -> 10329.82s]  got worked to death. What was that? Oh, it was red. Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[10329.82s -> 10365.30s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Damn it. I'm trying to get it to hit the wall. Come on. Hit
[10365.30s -> 10381.94s]  each other. Hit him. Do it. Oh my God, dude. Watch out. Watch out. Okay. We're good. Now some of you
[10381.94s -> 10389.78s]  can bring that back. I want blue to pick up this because we're running out of blue. Blue and purple.
[10390.74s -> 10411.66s]  Please. Couple. What? What the hell happened? At least that shit will be dead tomorrow. You wasted
[10411.66s -> 10418.30s]  a whole day talking about Drake and Josh. And I could probably waste a few days talking about
[10418.30s -> 10456.98s]  Drake and Josh. What a show. Yes. Okay. We'll go back to that tomorrow. You were 20 when that show
[10456.98s -> 10471.18s]  aired. Um, yeah. I was like 19 or something. I didn't watch Drake and Josh. So what? I'm like,
[10471.18s -> 10475.18s]  if I'm like 18 years old, 19, 20 years old, I can't enjoy an episode of Drake and Josh.
[10475.90s -> 10491.05s]  It's not for you. How many of you have Pokemon installed on your Switch right now or your Wii
[10491.05s -> 10497.58s]  or something? How many of you guys play Pokemon? How many? How many of you guys are over the age
[10497.58s -> 10504.94s]  of 18 that I can't wait for the next Pokemon game to come out? But I can't watch an episode
[10504.94s -> 10516.09s]  of Drake and Josh when I'm 20. Okay. Is that, but is that, that's not for you though. It's like a
[10516.09s -> 10521.00s]  game for, they make it that game for like a younger audience. You can't, you can't play that. Right?
[10522.76s -> 10532.52s]  Right guys? Wait, what am I doing? Continue. What did I just do? Did I not save the game?
[10533.16s -> 10550.10s]  All right. We're going back. Hey, I'm playing this. I'm playing Pikmin right now and you're
[10550.10s -> 10556.81s]  here watching Pikmin. What does that make both of us? But we're not, you're not allowed to play
[10556.81s -> 10566.38s]  something because it was made to have like a general audience in mind. Excuse me. What's wrong
[10566.38s -> 10588.49s]  with that? I only have two blues. We've got to change that. Is there any bigger ones out here?
[10588.49s -> 10604.18s]  I don't think so. Listen, like Pikmin. Okay. Cute does not mean only for children. Like look,
[10604.18s -> 10609.14s]  Pikmin, Olimar. Look, it's like a cute game with like Pikmins and they're so cute. And so look at
[10609.14s -> 10629.38s]  them. They're just like, Oh, only children can play this. That's not fair. I want at least like
[10629.38s -> 10652.97s]  six or seven. Wait, so you're not a child. No, I just act like one. Doesn't make me a kid. I'm
[10652.97s -> 10661.67s]  just one. I'm just a little kid that is wearing the suit. I'm wearing the suit glasses. Like a
[10661.67s -> 10667.11s]  nice pair of loafers as a joke in whatever movie or TV show you're watching. We're like, oh no,
[10667.11s -> 10678.28s]  the kid's got to be an adult. He's doing taxes. All right. So I got enough blue, I think. I do
[10678.28s -> 10698.92s]  need a bunch of red. I need white. 30. Boss baby Andy. 30, 30. And then N9. That's a pretty good
[10698.92s -> 10708.57s]  Nickelodeon sound by the way. This one. So let's supplement that with a little bit more yellow.
[10714.33s -> 10720.81s]  Okay. I have a ton of yellow. This is a yellow run. All right. Let's go. Who needs a nectar?
[10732.42s -> 10741.86s]  Drink it. I want you to be big and strong. Hit the bong on camera. I don't have a bong. I don't
[10741.86s -> 10749.14s]  smoke weed. I eat it. If I need to, if I feel like it, or if I want to. I do not really smoke
[10749.14s -> 10753.54s]  it. It irritates my throat. Just going to be completely honest with you. I don't like to
[10753.54s -> 10769.86s]  smoke weed because I feel like it's an irritant. It's an irritant. I love that snowman. It's so cute.
[10772.71s -> 10778.92s]  Okay. We dealt with that bird last time. Now we got this bridge. We went over here.
[10780.09s -> 10789.38s]  There was that fence. Where was that fence? Up this way. There we go. Okay. Monka. Oh,
[10789.38s -> 10803.48s]  there it is. Monka. Yes. Okay. I found it. White. There's another cave over here.
[10806.36s -> 10813.82s]  Anything this way? Let me just look over here. Um, this is the, oh, there's a, there's a couple
[10813.82s -> 10816.78s]  of caves. This is that cave, right? Okay. Wait, I'm going to go on this one first.
[10818.70s -> 10827.51s]  I think Monka. Whatever. I'm trying to stuff it in there. It's hard. The crown. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[10827.51s -> 10840.41s]  Where's that crown? He left three yellows behind. Oh shit, I did. More than that. Did I get them?
[10840.97s -> 10850.74s]  They just won't cross the bridge because they're dumb. What's your favorite bug?
[10851.94s -> 10863.67s]  Um, one of those big emperor beetles. Whatever they're called. The ones with the gigantic faces.
[10864.39s -> 10868.79s]  They have the long noses, the long jaws. They have the big twig face. What are they called?
[10868.79s -> 10880.73s]  Hercules beetle. Yep. That's one. I, if a Hercules beetle was on my floor right now, I would not
[10880.81s -> 10886.98s]  freak out. The bigger the bug, the less scared I will be of it. If a Hercules beetle walked into
[10886.98s -> 10891.86s]  this room right now, I would not get up and go, oh my God, what the fuck is that? No. I'd be like,
[10891.86s -> 10897.67s]  holy shit, that's a Hercules beetle. This is cool. Uh, if a, if a spider as big as my thumbnail
[10897.67s -> 10902.63s]  showed up in front of me, I would scream like a little kid. I would freak out. I would sprint
[10902.63s -> 10909.32s]  around. All the hairs on my body would stand up and I would, I wouldn't be able to come in this
[10909.32s -> 10914.60s]  room. I would have to stay out of this room for a few days. I wouldn't be able to go, I would not
[10914.60s -> 10925.88s]  be able to come in here. Uh, but a huge bug would just be, okay, that's a big bug. All right. This
[10925.88s -> 10941.88s]  guy doesn't want to go over here. Come on. I want to finish this cave. Big spider. Actually, no,
[10941.88s -> 10950.44s]  I want this. Yeah. Let's get this. All right. Can I get this without having to deal with this guy?
[10951.08s -> 10972.30s]  I don't think I can. I have to kill that thing. How am I going to do this? Just punch him with
[10972.38s -> 10998.76s]  Olimar. I can try that. I don't think I can even get up there. I don't have damage.
[11009.74s -> 11033.53s]  Wait a minute. I've got an idea. Ah, am I safe right here? I think it'll, I think it's going to
[11033.53s -> 11060.02s]  hit the wall. Yep. I'm safe right here. This is perfect. Kill. Oh shit. Everybody died. Perfect.
[11060.02s -> 11063.30s]  Nice. All right. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. We need blue to pick these
[11063.30s -> 11085.32s]  up. Blue, follow me. I need blue to get everything here. So let's do this right. We need, okay. We've
[11085.32s -> 11090.58s]  spread out. I wish I could hold C and make them spread out even further. I'm fucking wee.
[11090.58s -> 11110.06s]  Fucking stupid. Fucking wee. Fucking wee. Right. What are you expecting? I need like a, okay. So
[11110.06s -> 11125.51s]  we need a purple and a blue. Good. Okay. Now we need a purple and a blue. Good. Purple and a blue.
[11125.51s -> 11138.06s]  All right. What happened to, I'll take a break after this level. Oh, and then the rest of you
[11138.06s -> 11145.13s]  get that crown. Oh, you motherfuckers. I swear to God. Why are you doing that?
[11145.85s -> 11153.98s]  Why are you doing that? Do what? Cause you walked over here. I didn't tell them to do that. So why
[11153.98s -> 11157.82s]  are they doing it? I did not tell. I did not say anybody. I did not tell them to do that.
[11157.82s -> 11179.85s]  So why are you doing it? Oh God damn it. It's going to kill these guys. Isn't he? I know he is.
[11179.85s -> 11191.88s]  This is such a pain in the ass. You better not attack those guys. I will be so, I'll be furious.
[11191.88s -> 11231.11s]  All right. Hurry up. Get back to base now. The rest of you get this. Let's go. Raid song. Raid
[11231.11s -> 11238.42s]  song. Oh shit. All shame, no wow with the raid. Thanks dude. Welcome everybody. I'll give you a
[11238.42s -> 11250.20s]  song. It just takes some time to realize when you show boat, you show me, you show down, you show me
[11250.20s -> 11263.29s]  around. Thanks for the raid. Welcome. Am I going to be able to do this in time? Nah. Hope you had a
[11263.37s -> 11267.45s]  good stream. Thanks. Welcome everybody. I'm playing Pikmin 2 for the Nintendo Wii U.
[11268.09s -> 11272.46s]  The upscaled version from the GameCube to the Wii and then the Wii version ported to the Wii U.
[11273.10s -> 11287.37s]  I know. I know. It annoys me too. Name one other character from that show.
[11288.01s -> 11298.38s]  Come on. You can get there. Please get there. Don't make this a waste of time.
[11299.18s -> 11306.04s]  Are they actually not going to get there? Name one character from that show that's not Drake
[11306.04s -> 11316.17s]  and Josh. I don't know. Didn't they work at a movie theater? Josh worked at a movie theater.
[11318.94s -> 11327.14s]  There was a movie theater employee that he worked with. Whoever that was. I don't know.
[11327.14s -> 11336.70s]  All right. Well, I have 10 seconds left for them to bring these back. Only 120 what? Unspeakable
[11336.70s -> 11350.95s]  wonder. 70% of debt has been recovered. 10 seconds. Shit. At least get me one of them in there. Come
[11350.95s -> 11380.36s]  on. Come on. Hurry. Four. Three. Two. They're not going to get it. I'm missing somebody. Oh,
[11380.36s -> 11393.82s]  just a few reds. Who cares? If it was purple, I would be very upset. It's just like two reds.
[11394.38s -> 11400.90s]  At least I got the... The crown was a pain in the ass.
[11409.51s -> 11423.05s]  Jeremy, sing the Skyrim theme song, but say Monka S instead. I don't. I really don't know what the
[11423.05s -> 11435.29s]  Skyrim theme song is. It's the one that's like... I've never heard it before. What is it? I don't
[11435.29s -> 11439.94s]  know. Well, the animals that adopted me are actually rather cute once you get used to them.
[11439.94s -> 11447.16s]  Once we get the debt paid off, I might build a refuge for them. What do you think? This is not
[11447.16s -> 11454.50s]  a pre-recorded stream. Get out of here. Hey, as they say in England, fuck off. You know what I
[11454.50s -> 11460.92s]  mean? As they say in England, fuck off, mate. All right. I want to go back in there and go to the
[11460.92s -> 11471.93s]  cave. Let's take a break. I'm going to go pee. I'm going to refill my... Well, I have coffee.
[11471.93s -> 11477.38s]  Pretending I'm not drinking coffee. I'm going to drink some water, get a little bit more coffee,
[11477.38s -> 11481.82s]  and we will continue. Be right back. Don't go anywhere unless you have to go somewhere.
[11482.95s -> 11487.27s]  But definitely don't switch to the Super Bowl. I'll tell you the score right now. It's zero to
[11487.27s -> 11500.34s]  zero. Tom Brady has 15 interceptions. It's an absolute disaster for him. At least that would
[11500.34s -> 11677.26s]  be like... Whatever. I'll be back. What the hell is that? The ultimate gamer chair? The saw trap.
[11678.46s -> 11683.34s]  I got a question for you. Those of you guys that have or have ever experienced any time
[11683.98s -> 11689.67s]  with a refrigerator that has an ice maker in it? You have your ice. Water can come out of there
[11689.67s -> 11696.41s]  usually. And there's always the thing that says crushed ice. There's regular ice and then you
[11696.41s -> 11703.08s]  press the button. It's crushed ice. Has that ever worked in any fridge you've ever used with a
[11703.08s -> 11711.24s]  crushed ice? Doesn't it just spit out regular ice cubes but make loud fucking noises? Why is
[11711.24s -> 11722.62s]  that even on any fridge? I don't get it. I've never seen that work. It just goes... Ice cubes.
[11723.06s -> 11727.50s]  And some of them are broken. I don't even know why they put... Why do they even put that shit on
[11727.50s -> 11740.78s]  fridges? That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't do anything. You have a bad fridge. This has been
[11740.78s -> 11749.91s]  every fridge I've ever used that's ever had across multiple states and multiple continents
[11749.91s -> 11755.35s]  that I've never used the crushed ice fridge feature that has ever worked the way it's supposed
[11755.35s -> 11764.15s]  to be intended. I swear to god this is the last time I'll ever draw a German with a cat feature.
[11764.15s -> 11774.73s]  I swear. I swear. I promise. Sub. I'm serious. I've never seen it work. I thought that was
[11774.73s -> 11785.40s]  supposed to be Cheeto and I was like, holy shit. That's from a spore. All right. Let's keep going.
[11786.36s -> 11803.10s]  I want to go back in that cave. I love this game. It's very fun. All right. I want to go back in
[11803.10s -> 11811.94s]  that cave. Please read my chat message. Okay. What does it say? I've beaten Pikmin 2 and I've been
[11811.94s -> 11825.24s]  trying to give you tips. Well, I mean, there's almost 11,000 people here. Everyone's trying...
[11826.20s -> 11831.22s]  Look at the amount of tips that people are screaming at me. Half of them aren't even real.
[11832.84s -> 11837.24s]  Now, if I pay attention to your tips, what if they're not real? What if they're fake?
[11837.24s -> 11839.72s]  If you're trying to get me to throw a Pikmin off the bridge or something.
[11851.11s -> 11857.51s]  Ban if not real. No. I appreciate the tips though. I appreciate any tips you could give me except,
[11857.51s -> 11861.43s]  I mean, do I have a no back seating rule on this channel? I really don't.
[11862.86s -> 11867.45s]  No. People just write whatever they want. Half of it could be fake bullshit.
[11870.12s -> 11876.14s]  I want to go back in that cave, but I'll be okay. I'm going to be totally honest with you.
[11877.80s -> 11882.63s]  Back seating for me? Like, I'm not going to listen to you anyways. How many times have you
[11882.63s -> 11885.51s]  guys written something in here that was actually helpful? And I just didn't even care. I didn't
[11885.51s -> 11891.82s]  look at it. Like, I'm not going to listen anyways. That's happened many times. So it's not like I
[11891.82s -> 11905.85s]  have to have a rule. Why do I need a rule if I already don't pay attention? Why do I even try?
[11906.81s -> 11914.41s]  Look, it's all right. Everything's just good. I don't need any tips. I appreciate the tips,
[11915.05s -> 11920.58s]  but I don't need them because I'm a professional video game player.
[11920.58s -> 11933.72s]  And we went over that on the spore stream. Please tell me to go to the secret hole.
[11936.57s -> 11948.54s]  That sounds like a pretty good tip, actually. There's a secret hole, a secret tunnel.
[11949.10s -> 11956.63s]  Why did everything respawn? Hold on. Itchy inside of my ear. How did I lost somebody? 99 out of 100.
[11956.63s -> 11963.22s]  Where's the last one? I don't know where they are, but it's too late.
[11966.17s -> 11975.78s]  I'm not going to fight anything. I'm just going to go. I just want to go in the cave.
[11976.34s -> 11991.66s]  Why am I not feeding the Pikmin? I am. I'm going to give them the nectar. Let's go.
[11991.66s -> 12001.43s]  What's my opinion on roly-polys? The weird bugs that you find under the welcome mat?
[12002.70s -> 12013.48s]  Um, they're all right. Do I start on? What floor am I on? Floor one?
[12014.81s -> 12021.58s]  Shit. This is the first floor, isn't it? Damn it. It's the first goddamn floor.
[12022.30s -> 12028.94s]  Wait, technically I could run, right? Hold on. Technically I could just run and just go in.
[12028.94s -> 12040.92s]  I don't have to do any of this. I could just run. Okay, here we go. Where's the exit? Wait,
[12040.92s -> 12062.79s]  purple. Don't wake that motherfucker up. Get out of here. Did I just lose a white? Oh, man.
[12064.63s -> 12080.82s]  No, I didn't. I did. Shit. Same button. Nintendo. Why? I'm going to back up. In fact,
[12080.82s -> 12095.46s]  I don't trust any of you, so stay here. Oh, it's right here. Move. Go invent a console if
[12095.46s -> 12107.16s]  you keep complaining. I'm kidding. I don't actually believe any of these things.
[12107.96s -> 12140.63s]  I hope you know that. Okay, everyone get out of the way with a big Kappa. Kappa. I was on level
[12140.63s -> 12152.50s]  five or six before. This guy still believes in Santa. What a wild concept that we pretend is
[12152.50s -> 12164.42s]  real for like five to 10 years of people's lives. That's sort of bizarre if you think about it.
[12164.42s -> 12169.78s]  We just kind of like pretend that Santa's just a real thing. Oh, yeah, yeah. Santa's a real guy.
[12171.90s -> 12199.26s]  Run away. Run away. Run away. Where's the exit? Wait, little guys. There's only one. Santa is real.
[12201.88s -> 12208.47s]  Where's the exit? Thank God he's stuck there. Okay, where's the exit though? Right there. All
[12208.47s -> 12231.94s]  right. I mean, Santa was a real guy, but like 500 years ago, 800 years ago or something. Saint Nick,
[12231.94s -> 12243.86s]  right? Saint Nicholas. Isn't that based on a real thing? He used to put like toys in people's shoes
[12243.86s -> 12255.10s]  and stuff. It's based on something. What is it actually based on? What is it? No, it was a real
[12255.10s -> 12261.99s]  person. It was a real like a tale of a guy that did that. Oh, not Krampus. All right, this is the
[12261.99s -> 12266.55s]  one that I don't want to leave. There's a treasure on this one. And there's more purples to be had.
[12272.20s -> 12291.03s]  Red. Isn't it something in the Bible? Yeah, but there was a guy. Who is the guy?
[12293.67s -> 12304.63s]  Santa Claus is based on an actual living person. What was it? Patron saint of... Patron,
[12304.63s -> 12313.24s]  whatever. But fun fact, the actual Saint Nick punched a guy in the nose.
[12315.86s -> 12319.86s]  No, no, no, no, no. It's somebody else. Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors,
[12319.86s -> 12325.30s]  merchants, archers, repentant thieves, prostitutes, children, brewers, palm brokers,
[12325.30s -> 12332.42s]  unmarried people, and students in various cities and countries. What? Thank you for subscribing to
[12332.42s -> 12338.58s]  Fun Bug Facts. A vroly-poly vulgar has also been introduced to many locations in North America where
[12338.58s -> 12342.95s]  maybe each population is absent, whatever. And what does that have anything to do with Santa Claus?
[12343.51s -> 12348.30s]  Santa Claus is based on Saint Nick, who is a guy who left gold coins in prostitutes' laundry to
[12348.30s -> 12374.09s]  let... I don't even know if any of this stuff is... Thank God there's no timer. Oh, I don't want to
[12374.09s -> 12393.77s]  pick up anybody. Jerry, I don't want to pick anybody up. I just want the yellow one. You know
[12393.77s -> 12401.85s]  what's really interesting? So Seinfeld is a really, really old show. Nobody really pays that much
[12401.85s -> 12405.85s]  attention to it anymore. You guys think it's funny. You guys think that George is hilarious
[12405.85s -> 12410.73s]  and shit, and Jerry and stuff. That's really interesting. That's a really timeless show then.
[12412.98s -> 12419.02s]  Oh, that's really interesting to think about that. Is that a guy electric too?
[12421.45s -> 12443.16s]  It holds up. Oh yeah, I mean... Swarm. Swarm him. Take the swarm. Yeah, the swarm. That sounds like
[12443.16s -> 12455.62s]  a new keyboard. The swarm GX500. Loudest mechanical keyboard on the market. Let everybody know.
[12456.87s -> 12473.62s]  Just how much you're gaming with the swarm. Sounds like a bunch of bees. All right, electricity.
[12476.74s -> 12484.39s]  I have a quiet mechanical keyboard. I like soft. What do I have? A red? Cherry red? That's the one
[12484.39s -> 12493.91s]  that's a little softer, right? Didn't get anybody. Tough luck. Cherry red is with the O-rings, right?
[12493.91s -> 12499.19s]  I think that's what this is. Oh shit, I just completely... Well, I just absolutely exposed
[12499.19s -> 12506.38s]  myself. Yeah, no, it's all right. I just exposed myself 100%. I'm no longer using the Amazon Basics
[12506.38s -> 12512.62s]  keyboard. I told you guys that I was using that. I got a new, like a Corsair keyboard or something.
[12512.62s -> 12530.26s]  I don't know. All right, can we kill this guy, please? No, give me my friends back. Weigh him
[12530.26s -> 12546.81s]  down. Don't let him... Don't kill them. Weigh him down. Oh my God. How is this even missing?
[12550.15s -> 12566.50s]  Just rained down on his head. Okay, I don't know what any of this shit is, but take it.
[12574.50s -> 12575.06s]  What are they saying?
[12579.03s -> 12593.37s]  I can't. My voice is too hot low. I so badly just want to do the I-uh thing.
[12594.71s -> 12598.63s]  I just wanted to do it right now and I don't care what the repercussions are.
[12599.35s -> 12612.10s]  Oh, it's like a marble. There's so many of these enemies here right now.
[12619.19s -> 12631.46s]  You better not. Who's gonna tell you to stop? I'm gonna unsub if you do. How many people will
[12631.46s -> 12636.98s]  sub if I do it? That's a better question. Can we offset the sub that that guy I'm gonna lose from
[12636.98s -> 12651.58s]  that guy? I will. I'll sub if you do it. How many people will unsubscribe if I do that and how many
[12651.58s -> 12658.36s]  people will subscribe if I do that? This is tricky. I will gift a sub. Okay, this one, two,
[12669.10s -> 12686.70s]  pull. I don't trust a pull with that. You guys will just pretend I lose somebody. All right,
[12686.70s -> 12696.02s]  be careful in here. All right, pick him up. Let's see. I'm curious. I'm just gonna do it.
[12696.02s -> 12710.58s]  Whatever. Do it. Do it then. I'm gonna. I'm just thinking about when I want to do it.
[12710.58s -> 12718.63s]  I'm trying to get a good time. Don't. Please. I think I'm gonna get like a hundred subs if I do
[12718.63s -> 12727.42s]  that. 50 to 60 of you will unsubscribe and like a hundred will subscribe. So that's a net 40,
[12727.42s -> 12744.07s]  I guess, gain, right? Exactly, huh? All right, so if I say that word and I get a net 100,
[12744.07s -> 12750.81s]  a net 40, then if I say shpee immediately afterwards, will you come back? All those unsubscribed.
[12757.85s -> 12760.57s]  That's gonna be really. That's gonna fuck with the whole community, okay?
[12761.80s -> 12765.00s]  Because it's one thing that everybody hates and one thing that everybody loves. So I'm gonna.
[12765.00s -> 12768.92s]  This is gonna pull you guys apart. You guys are gonna get sucked through like an internet wormhole.
[12769.40s -> 12784.97s]  Shpee. What happened? Everybody all right? Is everybody okay? I don't know what happened.
[12784.97s -> 12798.90s]  Is everything. Is it going still here? Oh, shit. I'm losing subs. I'm losing subs, but I'm gaining
[12798.90s -> 12814.82s]  subs. I'm just kidding. Maybe we should do it again. All right. Watch out for these gliders.
[12814.82s -> 12823.03s]  I'm gonna call them gliders. Well, thanks for the community subs. Get away. He took me.
[12832.17s -> 12839.40s]  Get away from me. As long as it's not the Bane impression, it's fine. How many subs
[12839.40s -> 12853.46s]  to the Bane impression? Oh, my God. I just get everybody over here and spam. Stop it.
[12853.46s -> 12879.58s]  I hate these things. Pick me up every fucking time. Just get him. Put us down. Why is he getting us?
[12880.22s -> 12905.10s]  What the fuck? Finally. Geez. Kill him. I didn't say it. That could have been Elmo.
[12923.99s -> 12938.02s]  Just step on his head. Okay. Apologize. It's kind of fun to say though. You know that I say this
[12938.02s -> 12945.16s]  like in my off time. It's fun just to go. It's fun to do it. I don't know. It's nothing about it.
[12945.80s -> 12983.82s]  Why are they not attaching to him? Put us down. And now we're gonna die. Fucking dad. Ayayaying
[12983.82s -> 12993.62s]  again. The streamer dad. Boy. I wonder if I'm gonna get my first kiss.
[12994.50s -> 12998.38s]  Ayayaying. Dad, what the heck?
[13018.63s -> 13040.90s]  I hate that so much. What's that? Is that a starburst? Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. Oh,
[13040.90s -> 13055.27s]  you didn't say. Oh, I forgot. Shmee. There you go. How do I get health as Olimar? I need some nectar
[13055.27s -> 13076.30s]  too. I have a lot of new Pikmin. Get away. The ship will give you health? Oh, okay. You are dumb
[13076.30s -> 13095.56s]  dumb. Ha ha ha ha. Is Shmee gonna be on your gravestone? No. I hope not. Why is this not
[13095.56s -> 13118.94s]  giving me health? You lied to me. What is that guy? Press C. Why is he doing that? What do I do?
[13124.74s -> 13135.34s]  Hold C. What the hell? Hold C. I just did. This doesn't exit me from the level or something,
[13135.34s -> 13159.67s]  right? I'm holding C. Hold C. He's not doing anything. Okay, well, there's like a yeti over
[13159.67s -> 13192.25s]  here. You're stupid. What? Do it away from the Pikmin. That's not doing anything. Okay,
[13192.81s -> 13206.60s]  let's go for it. I want purples. We're gonna overwhelm. Three, two, one, go. Everyone's alive.
[13206.60s -> 13224.31s]  Nobody died. Oh, what's that? A butterfly? What is that? Who's in the ground here? Did I just get
[13224.31s -> 13231.78s]  more Pikmin? Okay, I'm gonna put some yellow in this. Or maybe some red. What do I have the most
[13231.78s -> 13258.04s]  of? Let's get red. Red's the easiest to get. They all missed. And aim. Oh my god. And aim.
[13258.76s -> 13265.72s]  Can we start banning? Can we start banning these people? Like, can we start? They're making fun of
[13265.72s -> 13272.22s]  me. Can we start banning them and making sure they don't show up again? Wicked funny. Everyone's so
[13272.22s -> 13293.70s]  funny. Can we start putting out bans, please? E and them. E and them. Cry baby. One, two, three,
[13293.70s -> 13302.73s]  four, five. I wish I wanted to get this to stop talking. Wait, if I switch to... Okay,
[13303.37s -> 13311.94s]  Louie's the one that's almost dead. Who cares? Now, oh, more purple. Oh, no, this is blue. Oh,
[13311.94s -> 13331.78s]  shit. Okay, I'm gonna get rid of some more. I'm gonna get rid of some more reds. You have so
[13331.78s -> 13337.75s]  many yellows. I love electricity. It's my favorite element. Electricity is my favorite element,
[13337.75s -> 13347.42s]  so of course I'm gonna want it. All right, what about... Watch out. Be careful here. Blue spider.
[13348.65s -> 13358.25s]  There's a lot of shit in here. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, boy. Well, back it up for a sec.
[13358.81s -> 13391.37s]  Let's take blue over here. Don't wake up everybody. Just be easy. Don't do that. Don't do that. Why
[13391.37s -> 13405.64s]  can you just... This is infuriating me. Hold on. Let me jam the Wiimote into my chest so I can
[13405.64s -> 13423.40s]  fucking aim it right. Why are they not jumping on his head? Oh, that only took like five tries.
[13424.12s -> 13446.26s]  They're friendly. What? Don't hurt them. What? Why not? They're gonna kill me. The Yetis are good.
[13455.50s -> 13469.54s]  Oh, yeah. A smashing claw animation. They're good, huh? Let them hit them. No. No, I'm not
[13469.54s -> 13478.10s]  gonna do that. I'm not gonna do that. Oh, this is not good now. They don't kill them. Frost us,
[13478.10s -> 13503.64s]  please. Fine. You better not be fucking with me. Oh, shit. Okay, cool. Oh, shit. We'll do that to
[13503.64s -> 13532.04s]  more of them. I got a lot of guys you can do that to. No! All right, there's another one.
[13532.68s -> 13547.59s]  I want him to do it to the purples. Get everybody over here. The purples really need to be flowered
[13547.67s -> 13573.50s]  up. Nice miss. Again. Oh, you got it. Nice. Just let him walk around and just do it. Stop moving. I
[13573.50s -> 13580.65s]  feel like he's gonna hit me with it. Okay, good. Okay. The rest of you, come back over here. Who
[13580.65s -> 13608.94s]  else needs it? Oh, look at all these yellows that need it. Come here. Good. All right, one more.
[13611.02s -> 13624.25s]  Okay. I'm done. I'm done. I don't care. I'm done. Kill him. Don't get crushed. All right. Well,
[13624.25s -> 13632.06s]  somebody attacked. Somebody attacked. Kill. Somebody attacked. Nobody had to do it.
[13636.66s -> 13652.70s]  Luis almost dead. Wait, I'm getting bored watching this. So, go watch the Super Bowl. Go watch Tom
[13652.70s -> 13671.61s]  Brady throw 50 interceptions. That's what you're missing. I'm telling you. Is the Super Bowl today?
[13671.61s -> 13690.57s]  Yes. Wait, the Super Bowl was today? Oh, shit. All right, we're good. There's still treasure
[13690.57s -> 13700.12s]  everywhere. Do a Super Bowl watch party. God, no. Okay, I want the nectar. Can I, can, can Olimar
[13700.12s -> 13717.51s]  drink this? Can we drink this? Like, can we drink it out of this? To heal? I don't know. How do we
[13717.51s -> 13727.56s]  heal? Super Bowl watch party, but it's just staring at a TV. Right, yeah. Uh, I think everybody pretty
[13727.56s -> 13746.87s]  much has it, so let's just kill him. Oh, he had a fist. The Super Bowl doesn't need another 10k
[13746.87s -> 13767.61s]  viewers. No, it doesn't. Giant metal hand. Perhaps it's an ancient work of art. What? He's going crazy.
[13767.61s -> 13771.29s]  Emergency. Pikmin are suffering. If you blow your whistle with B, you may be able to help them.
[13771.29s -> 13787.11s]  What's wrong with them? What do you do? Do you take too much DMT? What are you doing? I think we're
[13787.11s -> 13804.52s]  okay. I guess they were, they were suffering somehow. Super Bowl watch party with you staring
[13804.52s -> 13812.84s]  at the TV for six hours and just putting my fist up and going, yeah, after every time my team scores
[13812.84s -> 13826.44s]  points. This object seems to replicate a humanoid fist, a glove much like it once lay in my junk
[13826.44s -> 13832.66s]  hold. And here is that very glove. I have just found the missing rocket fist in my junk hold.
[13833.80s -> 13844.55s]  Tap A three times to launch it. One, two, punch. Oh, cool. Everyone get out of the way.
[13846.97s -> 13857.77s]  Ooh. Boom. Like a little three hit combo. All right. 99. We're good. No more treasure.
[13858.41s -> 13870.23s]  Let's get the hell out of here. That's the Luigi's Mansion.
[13880.14s -> 13901.05s]  Mm hmm. Level six. Not the final area either. Okay. Hold on. Let me just see what's around me.
[13902.87s -> 13907.75s]  What do we got? This is already a horrible place to be standing. Like right off the bat. Oh my god.
[13910.42s -> 13918.50s]  Holy shit, dude. What the fuck are you doing to me? What? You've got to be kidding me.
[13921.88s -> 13940.28s]  What kind of fucking place is this? I'm okay. I'm all right. Back it up. Purple, purple, purple,
[13940.28s -> 13949.62s]  purple, purple, purple, purple. What the fuck? Oh, that was stupid. Two of the homing missile
[13949.62s -> 13955.40s]  guys just sit right in front of the guy. What's with the design there? Who designed that? Terrible
[13955.40s -> 13960.04s]  design. Awful design. Worst design I've ever seen in a video game and I've played lots of them.
[13960.68s -> 13980.41s]  That's RNG. Oh, oh. Never mind. Worst I've ever seen in a video game ever. It's just a dice roll.
[13981.05s -> 14004.07s]  What we got in here? Fire, water. Okay. Don't die from this. Stay right here.
[14004.87s -> 14025.61s]  Okay. Keep going. Is that, what is that thing? Is that fire related?
[14026.33s -> 14035.51s]  I, you're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. Just get over here.
[14036.15s -> 14051.34s]  Oh, statue. All right. What else we got? All right. I think we're okay. This is going to be such a
[14051.34s -> 14096.97s]  horrible pain in the ass. I have to throw them across this. Almost all of them. It's a purple
[14096.97s -> 14113.43s]  in here. I don't want a purple with me. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.
[14113.43s -> 14128.63s]  Come here. Now I got a crew. There's like bad guys over here, guys. This is the guy that I'm
[14128.63s -> 14151.82s]  worried about. Pen. Fuck. I'm not going to be able to get that. Oh, punch it. Punch it to death.
[14151.82s -> 14192.28s]  Look at my health though. No, I need big guys. Shoot the rock. Shoot him. Thank you. Okay. Good.
[14192.28s -> 14205.62s]  Good. Good. Good. Good. What else is over here? Fire this way. That's it. Shit. I can't get that.
[14205.62s -> 14215.56s]  I can't get any of these things. I don't have enough blue. Come on. Really? What about the
[14215.56s -> 14242.17s]  Bulbman? A Bulbman? What do you mean a Bulbman? Did Bulbman die in the water? Oh shit. Okay.
[14242.17s -> 14276.50s]  Hold on. Oh, they have Pog. Two. How many do I have? Seven. Eight. Oh, no. There's no more?
[14276.50s -> 14302.62s]  Really? Reset the floor. I don't think, I think I only had seven blue to start. Damn it. That's
[14302.62s -> 14315.02s]  very disappointing. You had eleven. Did Bulbman are immune to poison, fire, electricity, and water.
[14315.02s -> 14322.31s]  I had more blues at the start of this level? I don't think I did. Did I? Did they die? I had eleven
[14322.31s -> 14331.53s]  at subspace six. I did. I did? Oh, right. That's right. These two assholes. Right. Okay.
[14332.49s -> 14368.47s]  Um, god damn it, Andy. God damn it, Andy. What's that even mean? Oh, wait. I have to turn it back
[14368.47s -> 14395.66s]  on. It went into sleep mode. I love his face. Uh, what's wrong with my Wii? Uh-oh. Um, it just made the
[14404.07s -> 14427.96s]  I have to put my password in. Hold on. I forget my, I forget my password. I just put it into,
[14427.96s -> 14442.36s]  I don't know what it is. Did I get it right? Password is, okay, good. Oh, password is Hewl12345.
[14443.32s -> 14464.89s]  All right, we're good. Come on back. Press what? He's pretending. Hey, listen, listen. Did you hear it?
[14467.53s -> 14492.10s]  All right, let's come on back. Nintendo. I just love playing the Nintendo. I just love the Nintendo.
[14492.10s -> 14507.06s]  Let's see if I get absolutely destroyed this time. The two dumb spawns right next to me that just
[14507.06s -> 14518.89s]  start shooting rocks everywhere. What do we got? Wow, that's a way better room. This room doesn't
[14518.89s -> 14540.66s]  suck ass. Okay, let's take the purples. I want, I don't know why I want to do Sir Finley Murgleton
[14540.66s -> 14562.12s]  so bad right now. It's just grabbing a hold of me. I don't know why. I need fire to get rid of that.
[14562.12s -> 14571.70s]  Punch them. I could try the punch. Yeah, I'm not bringing anybody over there. I'm going to punch.
[14578.22s -> 14584.22s]  Oh my god, hit him. That would have been horrible. All right, everybody stay back. I'm going for the
[14584.22s -> 14609.37s]  punch. I just got stun locked. Olimar is a clown. Olimar is a fucking clown. What happened? Wait,
[14609.37s -> 14629.19s]  what happens? Oh, just take rid of this so I can get over here. I don't even know why these guys
[14629.19s -> 14635.91s]  are even spawning here. It's like where are you supposed to even go with this? My teeth. I'm just
[14635.91s -> 14664.39s]  talking through my teeth. Move. Shoot him. Why did you, one walked all the way over there. What
[14664.39s -> 14674.54s]  is wrong with you? Get out of the water. Get out of the water. Get out of the water. I fucking god
[14674.54s -> 14680.06s]  fucked this place. Fucked this place. Fuck this level. What the hell? Where are you supposed to
[14680.06s -> 14701.53s]  even go? Get out. Make them shoot each other. Yeah, and then one of them is going to fire one.
[14702.49s -> 14707.77s]  That was the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life. I don't even know what happened. How
[14707.77s -> 14710.57s]  did that even happen? That was stupid. That was the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen.
[14726.12s -> 14770.20s]  Look, it's a bulbus. All right, I got a bulbus. Can I do this with Louis? Okay, do we have enough
[14770.20s -> 14781.34s]  blue to do this? Okay, thank god. Let's go. I need red as well to get rid of the fire and the
[14781.34s -> 14829.94s]  bulbuses. Here we go. Well, I had to do that because they have to pull the, they're going
[14829.94s -> 14837.51s]  to walk through that. Okay, there's one more of these assholes over here. Oh, perfect.
[14838.39s -> 14857.59s]  Good ING. Good ING. Don't get on that with them. You're just going to die if you do that.
[14858.15s -> 14866.62s]  That's pretty good ING. Nice. All right, then we just gotta wait for them to be done.
[14867.64s -> 14873.91s]  In the meantime, what can I do? I get a meantime. Oh shit, hold on. In the meantime, I'm gonna make
[14873.91s -> 14896.38s]  this guy shoot himself. The chest piece. Nice. Pog. Okay, now get shot. How much is that worth?
[14897.02s -> 14930.90s]  80. Pretty good. Pretty cool. You can do it. Yeah. Okay, I just keep hearing this in my brain.
[14931.70s -> 14949.96s]  All right, blues, get back. I said blue. I don't want any white there. Blue. All right,
[14949.96s -> 14959.43s]  we should have enough to get the last piece. It's 10. All right, is there anything else in here?
[14961.72s -> 14972.23s]  What about up here? No, that is all that remains. You all right? All right, you're good.
[14981.19s -> 14986.39s]  Go in there with them. You guys just really like to put yourselves into danger, don't you?
[14990.20s -> 14995.24s]  And then I'll be able to take everybody up. So again, please confirm with me again. If I go
[14995.24s -> 14999.08s]  into here just as Louie, everybody comes with me. It doesn't matter if they're part of the crew or
[14999.08s -> 15022.97s]  not, right? Correct. Okay. Fantastic. Goldman are immune to everything. That's good because I'll be

[15080.76s -> 15093.53s]  Okay, it doesn't look too bad so far. Unless there's something in the ground. And there's

[15366.79s -> 15370.19s]  I feel like it's like a mix of sour patch kids and ozone
[15383.84s -> 15387.76s]  It's really funny when people say that what are you talking about smelling ozone?
[15388.32s -> 15392.98s]  That's what you smell when it's like a when a thunderstorm is happening
