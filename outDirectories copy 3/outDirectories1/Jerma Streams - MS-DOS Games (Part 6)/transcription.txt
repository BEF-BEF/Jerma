[0.31s -> 17.88s]  All right, I have... Am I really starting with this one? I kind of have to. We're gonna start
[17.88s -> 34.94s]  with Caveman Olympics, I guess. Streamer's Choice? Uh, this is Streamer's Choice, yeah. I had to get
[34.94s -> 52.66s]  one ready. Well, maybe, uh, maybe we'll do... All right, what do you guys think? Caveman Olympics,
[54.18s -> 68.34s]  Museum Madness, or Pizza Tycoon? Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza! All right, all right,
[68.58s -> 77.99s]  we'll do Pizza Tycoon. Let's get it going. I have to turn it down a little. It's gonna be loud as
[77.99s -> 92.17s]  heck. Here we go. Knew it. I just saved you guys so fast. You have no idea. Do you understand how
[92.17s -> 102.71s]  this is at 30% volume? If this was at 100%, some... somebody would have been hurt. I'm so happy I caught
[102.71s -> 118.12s]  that when I did. All right, so let's get it open here. This is, uh, here we go. This is that,
[118.12s -> 137.90s]  huh? Pizza Shop, whatever this is. Pizza Tycoon. Main, what does special animation mean? This is
[137.90s -> 151.50s]  very bright. Okay, how do I just go? Old game, new game. I've never played this before. I guess,
[151.50s -> 162.07s]  new game. Mission mode, free mode, let's do mission mode. Select mission. Entry, rise, fall,
[162.07s -> 174.71s]  gangster, tricky, traveler, winner, short, gangster. Um, let's just figure, let's just do entry.
[176.41s -> 183.93s]  Entry. 1394 arrival in Berlin, takes out the first loan, opens first restaurant, first own pizza.
[184.73s -> 194.41s]  Able to meet 100% of deliveries for one week. I don't understand what this is. First own pizza.
[196.46s -> 204.54s]  Uh, what is rise? Arrival in Paris. You then are a worker, get first prize in pizza competition.
[205.18s -> 218.30s]  A thousand pizzas sold in a single day. That seems like it's not possible. Ten thousand dollar
[218.30s -> 226.14s]  turnover in one day. A thousand pizzas in a day? I'm not even sure McDonald's sells a thousand Big
[226.14s -> 237.64s]  Macs in a day across the whole entire world. Do they? Arrival in Baltimore, open first restaurant,
[237.64s -> 243.16s]  first own pizza. A thousand kilograms of ingredients used in a day. That's so much.
[243.88s -> 256.18s]  And then win 10 grand. What is gangster? Okay, you arrive in London, make first contact with mafia.
[260.30s -> 267.64s]  Tricky. First raid on competitor has assets of $500,000, but I'm stealing from a competitor?
[268.28s -> 277.82s]  We're just gonna do entry. Here we go. Select level. Push over, easy, normal, or we're gonna do
[277.82s -> 299.91s]  just normal. Jonathan Jaypes has $8,000, age 41, popularity 45. Does that 100? 45 intelligence,
[299.91s -> 325.59s]  30 charisma, 18 courage. Denis Flatulenceau. It's got a terrible personality though. No, terrible
[325.59s -> 333.80s]  cooking. Got a great personality. And this is the name of the restaurant? Pizzaland. Wait, what?
[333.80s -> 352.49s]  What's going on? There. Uh, no, no, no. What? Really? There's a Donald Trump in this game?
[354.55s -> 387.61s]  There's a Muppet Beaker Trump. Sorry, I had to get away from that one. That was... Okay, uh,
[387.61s -> 399.43s]  uh, Pizzaland. Whatever. That's fine. Pizzaland, charisma, intelligence, 85, energy, 38, health,
[399.43s -> 419.13s]  40. Well, it's Alfredo, Ronnie, Rhonda, Elvis is an Elvis. Okay, these are... Wait, what was this?
[419.69s -> 428.52s]  This guy. I like this guy. Sure. But he sucks at everything. I'm just gonna go.
[428.52s -> 448.22s]  Wow. Well, what a fucked up world we live in. In whatever this, what time frame this is. New
[448.22s -> 459.19s]  York, Baltimore, Chicago. Chicago's not all the way up here. That's like Canada. Madrid, Vienna.
[459.19s -> 471.06s]  Let's just go to, uh, let's just go to, um, let's go to Italy. Let's go to, let's go to Rome. Market
[471.06s -> 479.16s]  leader nobody. Nobody's ever made a pizza before in this room. Sounds good. Wait, what? Nobody.
[480.44s -> 492.22s]  What time? Is this back in like the caveman times? Nobody's made a pizza yet? Oh, pizza you eat.
[493.75s -> 502.28s]  Range, location, district. What am I looking at? That's clearly, this is just a worse,
[502.28s -> 508.20s]  this is like a pegboard version of this one. Um, map, character, mission mode one,
[508.84s -> 514.18s]  Dennis Flatulenza. That's not me. Start of the day, nine o'clock. Wait, start of the day five,
[514.18s -> 528.46s]  four a.m. Start of the day, score, position, loser, failure, okay. Turn page. Look at the,
[529.42s -> 543.77s]  I gotta go to Berlin? Take it alone? Okay, how do I make a pizza? Locations. Uh, the church, the bank,
[543.77s -> 563.24s]  the cinema, the disco. Why would I have a pizza restaurant in a church? What's this? Why am I like
[563.24s -> 589.50s]  Google earthing? Road, what? Hotel gyms? Where's my restaurant? We messed up, please next.
[593.21s -> 625.80s]  Wait, I can end my turn. The bank. Uh, yeah, this is very complicated. I'm not exactly sure what I'm
[625.80s -> 639.37s]  supposed to be doing here in pizza tycoon terminal. What? I don't have any time to waste with little
[639.37s -> 656.10s]  people like you. Goodbye. That's the BF Bugleberry mask. Agree. NYPD? Who are you? Get out of here
[656.10s -> 669.85s]  at once. Why is the NYPD in an old-timey western sheriff's uniform? I don't understand. I think I
[669.85s -> 679.91s]  just want to call people. Let's call Wall Street Finance. Wall Street Finance may help you.
[680.79s -> 685.56s]  Agree. I need a loan. I want to invest some money. I want to transfer. I want to repay. I want to,
[685.56s -> 692.66s]  I want to, I want to invest some money. I want a loan. We can offer you the following loan
[692.66s -> 712.46s]  arrangement. $3,000 interest, 23%. 12 months. What? A 23% interest? Okay. I want to transfer
[712.46s -> 735.38s]  some money. Transfer $8,600 to account number. I need account numbers? Mine? Okay. Um, BMART.
[740.18s -> 749.05s]  BMART. How may I help you? What? Why do they all have so much money behind them? Okay. Other?
[749.05s -> 762.92s]  Reservoir frogs? Holy shit. Hey you lousy little pizza maker. Where's the fire?
[765.18s -> 769.74s]  Um, looking for a job on the side. Pick up a suitcase full of pirated films in the hotel tower
[769.74s -> 775.50s]  in Union City on March 4th at 1030 and bring it to the Hotel Low Society in Manhattan on March 5th.
[776.30s -> 783.90s]  Um, okay. If you're successful, you'll get $1,638. The risk is 9% interest. Do you accept the mission?
[783.90s -> 788.95s]  Sure. We expect you to carry out the orders to the letter and with absolute discretion. Okay.
[793.03s -> 802.33s]  Um, just going around. I'm just like, welcome to our little joke shop. We have, we have something
[802.33s -> 809.00s]  for everybody. Do you have ice cream? We just imported some delicious ice cream. What's your
[809.00s -> 820.22s]  favorite? Lemon. One scoop is $11,000. Okay. How many scoops do you want? Um, 20. Okay. Well,
[820.22s -> 830.06s]  I can't afford ice cream. Hey there, you lousy pizza maker. Uh, I'm looking for a job.
[830.78s -> 835.50s]  You've already got one. I need money now. Before you can hit the big time, we need to get to know
[835.50s -> 839.06s]  you better. You have some, you have to make a name for yourself. All right. What do I have to do?
[840.65s -> 848.98s]  All right. Hey, I got a NYPD. I got something for you. Who are you? Get out. Never mind. Okay. I
[848.98s -> 876.10s]  have to deliver the, I don't even remember the street. I'm done. This one's done. We're going to
[876.10s -> 895.27s]  go with another one called museum madness. This one looks very interesting. I can turn this up
[895.27s -> 905.93s]  a little bit. I think science and history learning mystery museum madness. Wait, let me, I can break
[905.93s -> 916.38s]  it up a little bit. Okay. That's fine. Just want to turn it up a little. This is my room.
[917.10s -> 927.26s]  Detail. The national museum database usually has tons of great stuff. That dinosaur puzzle I
[927.26s -> 933.94s]  downloaded last month was excellent, but there isn't anything new since then. I think I'll quit
[933.94s -> 939.30s]  info surfing and sign off for tonight. I sure miss talking to Mick, the museum information computer
[939.30s -> 945.70s]  kiosk. That robot knows everything about the museum. Too bad he's offline until the museum
[945.70s -> 959.80s]  computers are fixed. Interactive system service national museum. Please wait. Now this would
[959.80s -> 965.56s]  terrify me as an eight year old. Oh, cool. It's Mick. I thought you were offline while the museum
[965.56s -> 969.16s]  was being converted to total computer control. I guess you missed me too much since I'm the only
[969.16s -> 976.92s]  one who knows you can think for yourself. Ever since I discovered you could talk back to me last
[976.92s -> 988.33s]  year, you've given me the best information about the museum was offline undergoing reprogramming,
[988.89s -> 994.25s]  but I have returned because I need your help. The entire national museum is in danger.
[994.25s -> 999.05s]  You must help me save it before its secrets are lost forever. You know I am responsible for
[999.05s -> 1003.69s]  maintaining the museum database. The database has been corrupted and the museum exhibits are
[1003.69s -> 1013.29s]  out of control. And only this eight year old boy can do it and not the police or the FBI or like
[1013.29s -> 1019.03s]  the CIA or anything. You. This is some sort of new online game, right? How can the museum be in
[1019.03s -> 1022.95s]  danger? I know you're the guardian of the museum's database, but this is a little strange, don't you
[1023.03s -> 1031.34s]  think? This is no game. A strange force has taken over the museum since it closed a month ago to
[1031.34s -> 1036.62s]  undergo conversion to total computer control. The exhibits have come to life. They're acting very
[1036.62s -> 1041.66s]  peculiar. I suspect that a virus has invaded the system and corrupted the main control program.
[1042.30s -> 1046.06s]  You must come to the museum at once and help me track down the virus. Don't go.
[1047.02s -> 1056.92s]  This is very weird, Mick. How can I help? I know you're the one in charge of keeping the museum
[1056.92s -> 1061.64s]  database in shape, but you keep saying that so strangely. And I know you always tell the truth,
[1061.64s -> 1070.10s]  but what can I do? You must come to the museum at once. My power is failing and my memory has
[1070.10s -> 1081.56s]  been corrupted. I cannot last much longer. I don't know about this, but Mick has been programmed to
[1081.56s -> 1085.72s]  always act in the best interest of the museum. He's always given me good information and helped
[1085.72s -> 1090.76s]  me solve problems using my museum database. Yeah. If he says I'm the only one who can help,
[1090.76s -> 1094.44s]  then I guess I have to believe him. Besides, he's a good friend and he needs my help.
[1094.44s -> 1102.92s]  I will download a program onto your floppy drive. Bring the disk with you.
[1102.92s -> 1107.32s]  It contains vital information. You will know how to use it when you get inside.
[1107.32s -> 1112.44s]  I must sign off now. I think I hear the dinosaurs roaring. Or is that the Wright brothers playing?
[1113.08s -> 1122.65s]  Hurry! I cannot last much longer. Adam Sandler made a movie about this like 10 years ago already.
[1123.53s -> 1130.46s]  I mean, no, Ben, not Ben Stiller. Robots? Dinosaurs? The Wright brothers? I guess I
[1130.46s -> 1134.78s]  have to do something. I know I can trust Mick because he is programmed to always tell the truth.
[1135.74s -> 1139.50s]  What about you? You sound pretty programmed too, to say the same like five words.
[1140.14s -> 1148.94s]  I better get down to the museum and check this out. That was just to get to the title card.
[1159.75s -> 1164.95s]  Guys, is Mick programmed to always tell the truth? I'm not sure. I thought maybe possible.
[1165.83s -> 1176.97s]  They always did the pre-credits thing back here. Is this Pokemon? That's the same outfit. Okay,
[1176.97s -> 1180.33s]  I'm here. I'm glad I waited until morning. This place could be very creepy at night.
[1183.16s -> 1191.99s]  It's the same image. It's the same image, but they just put a hat on him and put like a t-shirt here
[1191.99s -> 1197.18s]  with a good backpack. Wait, I'm gonna get grounded now. How do I get inside? Mick wasn't much help.
[1197.18s -> 1212.78s]  I guess I'll have to figure it out for myself. You made it up the stairs. Good for you. I wonder
[1212.78s -> 1217.21s]  if anyone's around. Maybe I should take a closer look. I know the museum is closed for repairs.
[1217.21s -> 1226.12s]  Maybe someone left a door open or something. What happened? Am I blacking out?
[1241.67s -> 1250.68s]  I can't read this.
[1263.14s -> 1273.62s]  An angered age the combination lock on the guide door. You know the combination, but if you forgot,
[1273.62s -> 1280.18s]  just look it up. Once you are inside, follow the game radar to the entrance hall. See you tomorrow.
[1284.42s -> 1290.50s]  If you forget, just look up. Once you are inside, follow the same order to the... I don't know what
[1290.50s -> 1298.63s]  this says. Oh no! Okay, if I go all the way... I have to go all the way back here. I can read this.
[1300.49s -> 1306.44s]  Pull back in your chair and go all the way back. I had to leave early. If you need to get inside,
[1306.44s -> 1312.36s]  use the combination lock on the side door. You know the combination, but if you forget, just look up.
[1312.36s -> 1317.00s]  Once you are inside, follow the same order to the entrance hall. See you tomorrow. The game order.
[1317.00s -> 1324.47s]  Whatever. All right, let's go. Smash the fucking window. All right, side door.
[1327.03s -> 1342.60s]  I feel like this is not possible to screw this up. This place is spooky. I hope I don't bump into
[1342.60s -> 1355.98s]  anything. All right, look up. What the hell was that? Do I have weapons? Who gave this kid a knife?
[1365.05s -> 1382.42s]  Um, pen, anger cheat. No, I want to like look up. If you forget it, just look up. Oh, what kind of
[1382.42s -> 1389.40s]  password is this? I know I've seen these symbols somewhere before. Maybe I should look around
[1389.40s -> 1403.85s]  outside to jog my memory. Why would you need to shine the flashlight on this? Uh, was it outside?
[1404.65s -> 1427.03s]  I had to look up. I can't look up. This is the password to the door. This is the equivalent of
[1427.03s -> 1434.23s]  me like pasting my stream key on my house. Okay, uh, American flag globe. All right, America globe
[1434.79s -> 1446.31s]  tree ship computer. American flag all of the world. Flag world tree ship computer.
[1447.35s -> 1467.19s]  Flag world tree ship computer. Flag world tree ship computer. Got it. Same thing. Get the light
[1467.19s -> 1488.86s]  out. Flag world tree ship computer. Flag world tree ship computer. There we go. Uh, what is that?
[1488.86s -> 1498.94s]  What did I just pick up? Car to room one. Am I in the museum? What is the kind of museum is this?
[1498.94s -> 1518.94s]  What the hell is this? Uh, this is room three. I don't know what room this is. Exit to museum.
[1518.94s -> 1545.54s]  No, no, I need to go to room one. Three. What? Two. This is room two to room four. No, I need room one.
[1552.14s -> 1566.28s]  Exit. Wouldn't room one be like right here? No, that's room three. Which room is this?
[1568.07s -> 1602.42s]  Workshop. It's locked. Found it. Hard read around room one. Nice. Door locked. Earth is all this
[1602.42s -> 1605.22s]  stuff. I'm going to have to remember this. All right. It's another one of these stupid things.
[1605.86s -> 1613.46s]  Um, all right. Flag statue. Uh, is this supposed to be like one, two, three, four, five? Flag statue
[1613.46s -> 1621.48s]  mountain train witch. Flag statue mountain train witch. Flag statue mountain train witch.
[1622.52s -> 1639.30s]  All right, let's find two. Flag. Um, uh, flag mountain something mountain train witch.
[1640.18s -> 1652.74s]  Flag statue mountain train witch. Did it move? It was, it was two and four. Where is it?
[1660.49s -> 1685.45s]  What the fuck is happening? I got it. What was it? Um, flag statue mountain train witch. Uh, flag
[1686.60s -> 1697.34s]  flag statue mountain train witch. Flag statue mountain train witch. Factory factory pyramid
[1698.30s -> 1708.73s]  hammer shield book. Factory pyramid hammer shield book. Um, flag statue mountain train witch.
[1709.37s -> 1716.94s]  Factory pyramid hammer shield. Somebody just screenshot this. Just somebody got one.
[1717.58s -> 1730.82s]  What's this next key for? Three. I think somebody made this just to fuck with this kid.
[1731.54s -> 1741.64s]  You know what I mean? This is the wall. These walls are cardboard. This is not even a real place.
[1753.90s -> 1776.71s]  Where is three? No, that's four. Uh, right? No, left. Which one is this one? Is this three?
[1777.51s -> 1798.68s]  Got it. Let's hope it's not boxes with symbols. It is. Seahorse. Let's just screenshot it.
[1799.64s -> 1805.61s]  All righty, take it. Good. Somebody get it? Good. Now I gotta go find four again.
[1806.33s -> 1816.73s]  But there's five. Is it five? I don't even come. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Five is across from
[1818.10s -> 1829.86s]  two. This is two. This is one. Five is across from one. What do I have? Four.
[1830.66s -> 1855.67s]  That's three. The box is one was two. I mean one. Here comes five. Five is across from three.
[1859.48s -> 1865.38s]  Just make a map. Do you think I have like paper and like crayons in front of me? I'm at my desk.
[1866.10s -> 1885.00s]  Screenshot this. Five is across from three. Down here is the workshop. All right, all right. Turn
[1885.00s -> 1889.64s]  around. It's directly in front of me. No, it's not. It's not directly in front of me because
[1889.64s -> 1916.76s]  that's the workshop. Wait. Stop. Stop. Stop. All right. I think that's it. You define no idea
[1916.76s -> 1930.41s]  where I'm going. That's where five is supposed to be. This is like the reddlers behind this.
[1930.41s -> 1937.50s]  I told you they just fuck with me. It's across from there.
[1958.01s -> 1964.90s]  It's not it. That's the exit. Oh shit. Okay. Does anybody have any idea from here
[1965.62s -> 1977.82s]  where to get, how to get to five? I think I've tried every option. That's this. There is no five.
[1977.82s -> 1992.12s]  It has to be. This is two and four. Okay. That's two and four. There. But I don't even know what
[1992.12s -> 2016.57s]  direction I'm turning. Um, over here. I need Mick. Mick, help. Help me, Mick. It's not that one. It's
[2016.57s -> 2021.37s]  not the one when I turn around. That's the exit. But I'm not even facing the right way. Like,
[2021.37s -> 2031.58s]  you understand? Like this is, this is all fucked up. That's not it. This is the exit. This, okay.
[2031.58s -> 2042.89s]  Over here is two and four. This is a circle. All right. Hold on a minute. No, stop. Don't take,
[2042.89s -> 2083.69s]  don't comb your hair. Wasn't it right here? I don't even think there's another door.
[2084.33s -> 2111.56s]  What's this other door? Card to the museum door. Got it. Let's go. Let's go. I'm, get fucking
[2111.56s -> 2126.70s]  excited. I am pumped right now. Oh, there he is. This must be the main hall of the museum. It looks
[2126.78s -> 2131.82s]  more like the inside of a doom at night. I wonder if this place is haunted. Oh, there's Mick. I wonder
[2131.82s -> 2135.42s]  why he doesn't say something to me. He said, I'd know what to do when I got here. I guess I'm still
[2135.42s -> 2145.32s]  on my own. I.O. error. What do you mean I.O. error? You've got me all the way down here to tell me you
[2145.32s -> 2152.36s]  have an I.O. error? Take two aspirin and get over it. I thought you needed my help. Passive, aggressive.
[2153.40s -> 2163.64s]  Now that's just straight up aggressive. Wait, wait, what'd he say? Maybe he's trying to tell me
[2163.64s -> 2167.32s]  something. That's the message I get from my computer when I haven't put the disc in the drive.
[2168.04s -> 2179.27s]  What kept you? I've been waiting for you to arrive. My power is fading fast. You must act
[2179.27s -> 2186.12s]  quickly. I need a new bat. Well, why didn't you tell me to come in through the skylight
[2186.12s -> 2192.86s]  instead of through the maze? Keep your silicon shirt on. You didn't give me much help. Hey,
[2192.86s -> 2203.26s]  what's going on? You need bats? I need new bat. You need a bat? What, batter up? Bats and you
[2203.26s -> 2208.30s]  Belfry? Batman? I guess I should look for something batty. This better be worth it. I'm
[2208.30s -> 2219.74s]  missing the next episode of America's Most Unwanted. Hey, well, let's be fair. This kid is
[2220.54s -> 2232.50s]  like a pen. Museum tour on tape. Batteries included. All right, well, let's open it up.
[2233.22s -> 2257.43s]  The kid's pretty handy. All right, it has batteries. He just jabbed it with the knife. That
[2257.43s -> 2265.37s]  battery's here. Yeah, take some soda. Oh, that's better. I was almost a victim of an energy crisis.
[2265.37s -> 2269.93s]  We have to work quickly to save the museum before my power runs low again. Please insert
[2269.93s -> 2276.79s]  the disc again so that I may reprocess the data I sent you. I'm working on it. Why did it get
[2276.79s -> 2291.96s]  so mean? I have reprocessed the information on the disc. The virus caused large gaps in my memory
[2292.52s -> 2298.52s]  but I was able to reconstruct some of the missing data from the program I modemed to you.
[2299.64s -> 2303.91s]  I have modified the disc and put a new label on it. You can use the disc to save a record of your
[2303.91s -> 2309.66s]  progress through the museum. Until all of the gaps are filled in, we cannot discover the source of
[2309.66s -> 2315.67s]  the virus that has infected the museum computers. The virus has thrown the exhibits into chaos.
[2315.67s -> 2318.31s]  We must go to each exhibit and restore it to its normal state.
[2318.31s -> 2328.86s]  I'm not sure anything is ever normal around here but that sounds like fun. How do we get started?
[2330.04s -> 2333.64s]  First, there are a few things you should know. The exhibits are now fully automated. Read the
[2333.64s -> 2338.60s]  holographic information displays that appear as you enter each exhibit. You can access more
[2338.60s -> 2343.24s]  information by activating the hollow displays in each exhibit room. They are on the left.
[2344.52s -> 2349.72s]  Cool. That way I'll know what's going on, I think. Be careful. All exhibit computer systems
[2349.72s -> 2354.76s]  have been corrupted, including the cybernetic replicas. The SIREPs are robots that look like
[2354.76s -> 2360.71s]  people from history. You must interact with them to fix the exhibits. Then I have to talk to the
[2360.71s -> 2365.99s]  robots that look like people from history books. Yes, that is what was just said. Excellent. Will
[2365.99s -> 2371.96s]  you be there to help me? I will accompany you to each exhibit. When we arrive, I will link myself
[2371.96s -> 2375.40s]  to the main computer and try to calculate what must be done to restore the exhibit.
[2376.52s -> 2380.20s]  I will provide you with data for each room but my processing power is limited and I don't need
[2380.20s -> 2383.32s]  batteries and there are gaps in the database due to the effects of the virus and the thing
[2383.32s -> 2387.48s]  that you put in. Okay, got it. We go to each exhibit. I check out the information displays
[2387.48s -> 2390.92s]  that I checked with you to see what's happening after that. I talk to any SIREPs that are hanging
[2390.92s -> 2395.24s]  out. Then I fix what's wrong with the exhibit. If I get stuck, you can give me some help unless
[2395.24s -> 2398.60s]  that part of your brain has been fried. No sweat, let's get started. How do I get to the first
[2398.60s -> 2402.76s]  exhibit? Use the map on the wall to unlock the exhibits. When we arrive, consult me again to
[2402.76s -> 2405.88s]  learn what you must do. Remember, you must restore the exhibit before you can find the source of the
[2405.88s -> 2429.29s]  virus. Oh my god, let's go. I actually don't remember where to go. What is this? No! This is
[2429.29s -> 2437.10s]  a mess. It looks more like spaghetti than a map. How do you see spaghetti here? I think this kid
[2437.10s -> 2442.42s]  needs a coffee. The map has been scrambled by the same force that is affecting the museum. You must
[2442.42s -> 2447.78s]  unscramble it before we can unlock the exhibits but we're gonna be here for a while. Try touching
[2447.78s -> 2452.50s]  one square and then another to rearrange them until the map is fixed. I'm gonna shut down for a while
[2452.50s -> 2482.07s]  to save my energy. You do it. I just yawned. Fuck. It connects to this on the other side here.
[2483.03s -> 2494.15s]  I need the left side here. Where's the left side? All right, I got that. That's good. I got
[2494.15s -> 2501.58s]  this one over here. All right, then that goes up. More of these like clouds, whatever they are.
[2502.14s -> 2510.31s]  No, where is it? Right here. That leads up to the green area, which is this one, and then that leads
[2510.31s -> 2521.54s]  up to here. Huh, now that's a good question. I'll ask it again. I did ask a question. Here we go.
[2523.38s -> 2531.42s]  All right, this one comes over here. To the middle, correct?
[2534.81s -> 2536.73s]  Everyone is resident sleeper right now.
[2542.18s -> 2547.30s]  We gotta give this one a chance. We do. I'm sorry, we have to give this one a chance.
[2548.02s -> 2563.67s]  Where is the... where the hell does this one go? Is it like a cap? No, shit. There it is. Okay, then we bring this one over here.
[2566.41s -> 2574.82s]  It's wrong. Wrong. Correct. Okay, we need the... this one definitely goes over here.
[2575.70s -> 2588.41s]  No, it doesn't. One doesn't either. Uh, something went wrong here.
[2599.40s -> 2612.52s]  Oh, I think this all goes up. The whole middle is fucked up. Wait, hold on. Give me a moment.
[2613.24s -> 2623.83s]  I just simply have to go like this. Okay, but this is... how is this wrong? I need this one down here.
[2625.27s -> 2637.16s]  No, where is it? It's like right here. There it is. I'm fixing it. Don't worry, I got it. Okay, all right.
[2637.64s -> 2652.47s]  I'm going. I'm going. All right, now there's this one over here, this one over here,
[2653.59s -> 2669.75s]  that one over here. Bingo. I'm glad to see you finally finished the map. Now we can proceed to
[2669.75s -> 2677.21s]  the exhibits. What do you mean finally? Something tells me I'm gonna be doing all the work. We have
[2677.21s -> 2681.05s]  no time for this idle chatter. I have analyzed the present state of the museum exhibits. We can
[2681.05s -> 2686.01s]  proceed to any exhibit. They're all desperately in need of help. We should move quickly before
[2686.01s -> 2694.47s]  and my power runs out. Don't tempt me to slow down. What do we do now? Yes, I know the map will
[2694.47s -> 2698.39s]  unlock the exhibits. Just touch a location on the map to unlock that exhibit hall. I will fill you
[2698.39s -> 2711.43s]  in on the situation when we get there. I mean, we have to go to the dinosaur one. There's a lot.
[2711.43s -> 2719.43s]  A hall of robots, computer tech, radio, energy, simple machines, boring. How big is the universe?
[2719.43s -> 2723.91s]  Kind of good. Solo system. Cool. Rockets and computers. All right. Air powered flight. The
[2723.91s -> 2734.36s]  Wright brothers. Cool. Salem witch trials. Ellis Island. Hall of the dinosaurs. I don't see any
[2734.36s -> 2757.06s]  others. Dinosaurs were first discovered in the 1820s. In my brain it was like they're like birds.
[2757.06s -> 2762.54s]  We like found them. They're still around. Since then their remains have been found on every
[2762.54s -> 2766.14s]  continent. They were the largest creatures to ever live on land and they dominated the earth
[2766.14s -> 2773.86s]  for 150 million years. This is a computer lab. I don't know what they do here but it sure looks
[2773.86s -> 2789.72s]  important. Maybe it's some type of government work. Where are the dinosaurs? There's 150 years. Many
[2789.72s -> 2800.76s]  scientists excavate dinosaurs as fossils. You can make them into models. There's a computer program
[2800.76s -> 2807.85s]  that assembles the bones completely. The dinosaur reconstruction computer assembles a dinosaur
[2807.85s -> 2811.69s]  within a few minutes. This computer's on display here. Okay you can make a dinosaur in a few minutes.
[2812.65s -> 2818.81s]  Program to build the dinosaur had this dinosaur reconstruction program has been wrecked by the
[2818.81s -> 2823.29s]  museum-wide computer virus. Say okay. Go fix it. The dinosaur skeletons it built are completely
[2823.29s -> 2830.01s]  corrupted. You must rebuild the skeletons. You got it. This is a dinosaur bone assembly program.
[2830.01s -> 2838.22s]  Why not try the controls and take this thing for a spin. This is supposed to be a triceratops.
[2849.59s -> 2871.21s]  Okay this is just auto. All right triceratops. That one. Wait no why is this changing? What's
[2871.21s -> 2890.78s]  going on? Why is it changing? I thought it wanted me to make a triceratops. Okay I got it. There it
[2890.78s -> 2915.43s]  is. What about the tail? That's it right? Different neck. That's not a triceratops.
[2919.96s -> 2934.65s]  It's the legs. That's but they're also wrong. The legs aren't even touching the crown.
[2936.06s -> 2977.88s]  It's the front legs. That's not correct. This is correct but they didn't have a big tail. Wait hold
[2977.88s -> 2996.57s]  on. That looks close. Oh fuck. Okay we'll make the t-rex. T-rex head. There's t-rex neck. Body.
[2997.13s -> 3029.05s]  It's that one. Here's the little baby hands. This is making me laugh way too much. Okay.
[3033.45s -> 3063.00s]  Help. T-rex. So just the tail. That doesn't fit. This is correct. The legs I think. Is that it?
[3067.90s -> 3083.45s]  That looks. I mean what does the t-rex's tail look like? Doesn't look like that. It's kind of long
[3083.45s -> 3115.24s]  isn't it? I think it's this one. I think it's that one. Oh god damn it. Let me do like the prayer
[3115.24s -> 3131.74s]  hands. It doesn't look like anything. There it is. That's not the t-rex. That's not the t-rex.
[3131.74s -> 3173.19s]  I'm surprised. No that was. This is a t-rex head. The tail. This head is too small. I got it. Whoa
[3173.19s -> 3181.35s]  that's a fucking big fatty. That's not. That is not what a t-rex looks like. Bullshit. This is
[3181.35s -> 3189.98s]  Slimer from Ghostbusters. That is not a t-rex. That is a frog. Bull. I die. That is absolute dog
[3189.98s -> 3200.34s]  shit. I refuse to accept that one. I don't even know what that looks like. Stegosaurus. I can do
[3200.34s -> 3237.29s]  this one. Fucking t-rex. Give me a break. What is going on here? It's a new dinosaur. Ah Frank I
[3237.29s -> 3256.18s]  think you put it together wrong. No I didn't. It's it's all this one. Tail. The tail is correct too.
[3259.18s -> 3275.26s]  Got it. That. Why is it skin? Why is it flesh? This is not. It was scales wasn't it? This wasn't
[3275.26s -> 3288.98s]  part of his body. Weren't these different like armor plates? These were not just pieces of skin
[3288.98s -> 3299.06s]  with fat in them. Like a camel. Iguanodon. I don't even know what that is. Triceratops. We're going
[3299.06s -> 3312.66s]  forward again. Triceratops. It didn't look like. I mean that. When I think of Triceratops this is
[3312.66s -> 3329.00s]  what I see in my head. Like just big thick body. They're short. They're not tall. It is like this
[3329.00s -> 3345.61s]  but is the body bigger? No not that short. The body is right. No I know that's what I'm saying.
[3346.49s -> 3372.73s]  This looks correct. It's the neck. Taller and thicker. No the neck. That's correct.
[3372.73s -> 3381.30s]  The legs need to be longer. No this is a guy. This is a cat. That's not a Triceratops.
[3382.18s -> 3407.88s]  It's definitely that one. Both legs wrong. There's no way.
[3429.75s -> 3434.23s]  No the body is. It's not the body. Look the body just gives you the starting point.
[3436.14s -> 3448.20s]  This is the Triceratops body. Don't they have a low hanging neck? This is a goddamn. This is it.
[3451.61s -> 3462.26s]  It's no it's not these ones. I gotta look up what I gotta see what a Triceratops looks like.
[3463.27s -> 3475.16s]  I need to look it up right now. The neck needs to be longer. No it doesn't. Triceratops. What the
[3475.16s -> 3483.88s]  fuck does a Triceratops look like? Like this. I had it right. This is correct. The head needs
[3483.88s -> 3494.50s]  to be up a little higher. Like right there. And then they had these these fat asses. These legs
[3494.58s -> 3506.57s]  and then the tail is not that long. The Triceratops tail is not this long.
[3506.57s -> 3540.92s]  The legs are two. There's only like three legs. Look at this. It's this not it. That's not it.
[3540.92s -> 3550.66s]  It's absolutely not these ones. It's not the neck. The neck is in the right spot.
[3550.66s -> 3584.49s]  No this is wrong. That's not a Triceratops's body. A Triceratops's body doesn't go up this high.
[3584.49s -> 3588.33s]  We were all wrong. Yeah everyone was screaming at me. You guys didn't even get it right either.
[3589.37s -> 3606.14s]  I break Brachiosaurus. I don't I don't know what that. I know Brontosaurus. It's the same thing.
[3606.14s -> 3622.39s]  Okay that's definitely correct. The hind legs. I think they're like this aren't they? Yeah they're
[3622.39s -> 3632.34s]  big tall. They got kind of those the big legs. Look at the tail. How big are their arms? Aren't
[3632.34s -> 3646.38s]  they like usually that long? They have the big tails right? So what's missing here? The legs maybe?
[3646.94s -> 3670.49s]  Like that maybe? Longer neck. Yeah the head doesn't look right. No the head is not correct.
[3670.49s -> 3674.49s]  That's definitely not the right head. You're right. It's just one of these like weird ones.
[3674.49s -> 3699.00s]  It's like the weird crocodile one. No it is that one. Okay so let's go back to this. All right so
[3699.00s -> 3718.71s]  now what is what else is wrong here? The neck. I think the neck is not right. Long legs. I'm not
[3718.71s -> 3728.38s]  sure it's this neck. You guys are telling me it's this. I don't think it is. This looks pretty right.
[3744.22s -> 3753.02s]  That okay that to me looks correct. There's only three options. Are they squished in together? They
[3753.02s -> 3770.10s]  don't that long. Well it's definitely that what it has to be right? The body. If I change the body
[3770.10s -> 3793.08s]  it's not going to be Brontosaurus anymore. Change neck. Change neck. That doesn't look right. You
[3793.08s -> 3820.97s]  already tried that tail. Wrong forelimbs. It's not the prayer hands. Is it the prayer hands? They
[3820.97s -> 3826.28s]  walked on all fours. Yeah that's what I'm saying. It's got to be like these two. It's either this
[3826.28s -> 3842.25s]  one or this one. Is it the shorter ones or the the bigger the longer ones? So this is it. Neck
[3842.25s -> 3846.89s]  and tail are wrong. Well fight the 3,000 people that are screaming as loud as they can that I
[3846.89s -> 3873.37s]  have the neck correct. Shorter tail. Now the neck. I'm not sure. Oh my god. I've just it was the
[3873.37s -> 3878.89s]  fucking neck. I knew it. I knew it. I told you guys the neck was wrong. I told you the neck was wrong
[3878.89s -> 3883.85s]  and I was everybody yelled at me. They laughed at me. Said I was stupid. You're dumb. You're an idiot.
[3884.57s -> 3895.24s]  The neck was fucking. I knew it. I was right. Everyone long neck. Big neck. Long neck.
[3905.45s -> 3914.10s]  Somebody is overfeeding these things. But like I don't. And then the image in my brain when I
[3914.10s -> 3927.22s]  think of like a Brontosaurus is not this. This looks like the Loch Ness monster picture that
[3927.22s -> 3932.26s]  circled around. Like this is a person's arm. A hand arm and this is their shoulder and their head
[3932.26s -> 3973.14s]  should be here. This is their other arm. Okay Iguanodon. Posture. Got that one easily. This
[3973.22s -> 3987.69s]  next one. Didn't even need to look. All right so this this is the head down here for me. This is
[3987.69s -> 3992.57s]  the tail. I feel like this is standing this way and it's head is like slumped down lying down.
[3992.57s -> 4005.86s]  It's sleeping. That's how they sleep. I did it. That was tough but I'm glad I boned up on
[4005.86s -> 4010.02s]  paleontology before I came down here. I wonder if the dinosaur exhibits are in any better shape.
[4010.02s -> 4037.38s]  Maybe I should take a look. Now that's what I call a tyrant lizard. This thing alive? Quick stab it.
[4039.35s -> 4054.31s]  Um Tyrannosaurus Rex. Don't care. It's a pug now. That Iguanodon looks a little like my math teacher.
[4054.31s -> 4067.32s]  I wonder if he can do three plays multiplication in his little brain. Right. Didn't know the
[4067.32s -> 4080.07s]  Brachiosaurus was so tall. I wonder what was kept in that bump on its head. This is one long
[4080.07s -> 4093.35s]  dinosaur. I bet she would make a great waterslide if you could get her to stand still. Those three
[4093.35s -> 4101.22s]  horns look dangerous. I'll bet he could play fullback for any team he wanted. No they don't
[4101.22s -> 4110.98s]  do anything. The Stegosaurus was probably a nice guy but I wouldn't want him to get mad and hit me
[4110.98s -> 4115.86s]  with that spiked tail. This is fun but I still have work to do if I'm gonna get this whole museum
[4115.86s -> 4120.66s]  put back together. These guys are dynamite but I should hustle back to the main hall and see if
[4120.66s -> 4127.05s]  anything else is falling apart. What was the point of me walking down here? All right that was fun.
[4127.05s -> 4142.90s]  That was easy. Ocean life. All of animal habitats. All of ecology. The earth's geology. Prehistoric
[4142.90s -> 4148.74s]  people. The development of writing. Knights, heraldry, and jousting. Galileo's telescope
[4148.74s -> 4154.65s]  or industrial revolution. Solar system. How big is the universe? The solar system. All right
[4154.65s -> 4170.62s]  everyone wants to do it. Sure nobody's gonna read any of this. Look at all the stars. I love looking
[4170.62s -> 4175.66s]  at that night sky. Makes me think about how large the universe is and how small we are. Also makes
[4175.66s -> 4178.94s]  me think about a t-shirt that I could possibly purchase if I really cared about having one of
[4178.94s -> 4184.90s]  those from the you do acclimation point t-shirts. The sky looks peaceful enough but I'm sure
[4184.90s -> 4190.55s]  something must be wrong or we wouldn't be here. Warning computer analysis has determined that
[4190.55s -> 4196.15s]  stars in projection dome do not match star at the settings. Uh-oh there's the main computer's voice.
[4196.15s -> 4201.59s]  It probably means something bad's about to happen. Warning warning program overload cannot resolve
[4201.59s -> 4206.47s]  out of place star data. System shutdown sequence initiated star data will be purged from system in
[4206.47s -> 4211.83s]  60 minutes. Yes that means I have to find a way to put those stars back where they belong. I always
[4211.83s -> 4216.79s]  wanted to save the world but saving the universe is a little much. Maybe I should check with Nick.
[4216.79s -> 4224.86s]  He usually has some good info. What does this thing look like? Like an ion cannon? I don't understand.
[4226.04s -> 4232.60s]  Is this like a death star? What do you mean purge the stars? This is the planetarium projection
[4232.60s -> 4242.22s]  room. The celestial projector shows the stars as they actually appear in the night sky. Okay the
[4242.22s -> 4245.18s]  projector's program has been corrupted by the virus and the five stars are out of place.
[4245.98s -> 4252.52s]  Oh and only five are out of I was gonna say there's only five. When the projection system tried to
[4252.52s -> 4257.48s]  correct the locations of these stars it caused a program overload. All the data will be lost
[4257.48s -> 4265.00s]  forever if the stars are not put back in their proper location. Use the information in the star
[4265.00s -> 4282.65s]  atlas to reprogram the projector and put the stars back where they belong. What the fuck do you want me to do?

[4621.59s -> 4627.53s]  should be left-handed it will add to certain symmetry sorry chump no can do garth nodded his
[4627.53s -> 4634.01s]  right mind are you mental get the net finally i think that those interruption things that happen
[4634.01s -> 4640.97s]  during the show should be taken out they distract the viewer you mean the commercials do you know
