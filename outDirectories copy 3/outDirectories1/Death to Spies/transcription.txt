[0.00s -> 15.30s]  Where am I supposed to bring this guy? This is a gigantic base with people in it, how am I supposed to sneak him out?
[15.30s -> 21.54s]  Leave the base with the captive. Oh, the body can be hidden in a truck, and that makes sense.
[21.54s -> 26.66s]  Okay, well you stay put, I'll be back. I killed him.
[26.66s -> 36.47s]  I've been sitting here for at least a few minutes, trying to figure out what exactly this fucking guy is doing.
[36.47s -> 44.53s]  Is he wiping down this old rusty cabinet with his hands? Or is he looking for a stud?
[44.53s -> 51.61s]  What are you doing? Stop, stop it please. I had to do that, you had...
[51.61s -> 68.23s]  Who was that? Oh he found me, he found me. He is trying to figure out how to shoot me right now.
[68.23s -> 77.23s]  Oh shit, did you guys see that? That fucking hat over there. I can't seem to hit it. How do I hit this fucking hat that's on the ground?
[77.23s -> 93.93s]  You guys are so stupid, you can't hit a fucking hat on the ground. Is that what you're seeing?
[93.93s -> 111.33s]  Who is flying by and dropping missiles on this place? Stop with the fucking bombs being hidden by this guy.
[111.33s -> 116.21s]  Are you kidding me? Are you guys kidding me right now?
[116.21s -> 124.18s]  These people are all out of their minds. They keep coming in here, realizing where I am.
[124.18s -> 130.99s]  And then somebody throws a grenade into the room and they have to leave. And some of them actually die.
[134.73s -> 142.31s]  There he is, I found him. Oh wait, Jerry, did you just throw a grenade into the room?
[142.31s -> 148.50s]  Which one of you morons is going to throw the grenade? That's the question.
[148.50s -> 158.66s]  We got the whole troop in here. Who is going to be the trigger finger moron? That does it.
[158.66s -> 173.98s]  What's the hold up? I don't understand what the hold up is. Was it you? Was it you?
[174.98s -> 194.31s]  What's going on? He's pointing his gun over.
[194.31s -> 199.55s]  What happened over here? I heard an explosion of some sort.
[199.55s -> 213.45s]  Throw it. Throw the grenade. Here we go, it's my chance. Throw it.
[213.45s -> 224.26s]  Did you just throw one in here? Why would you walk in the room after you threw it? You threw it into the wall.
[224.26s -> 230.06s]  I can't stop playing in the grenade room. I've just been reloading this over and over again.
[230.06s -> 237.07s]  That guy didn't even attempt to get out of the way.
[237.07s -> 244.00s]  Something interesting. If you take a look at the minimap you see all the green blobs.
[244.00s -> 251.00s]  Those are all the people, all the guards, all the hotel staff, all the people here cannot see through my disguise.
[251.00s -> 256.71s]  There's one red blip. Do you want to know who it is? The chef.
[256.71s -> 266.48s]  There are other chefs in here that can't see through. I'm just going to throw a fucking plate in this guy's face.
[266.48s -> 279.82s]  That just hurt me. Did this guy grab my leg? What is going on? What is hurting me?
[279.82s -> 286.14s]  What the fuck just killed me? Did I freeze in the freezer?
[286.14s -> 290.64s]  Oh, don't tell me you can freeze in the freezer. Do not give me that kind of power.
[290.64s -> 297.61s]  Hey, Gary, just the man I wanted to see. Hey, look, can you go ahead and grab me some extra kebabs from the freezer?
[297.61s -> 300.61s]  What a fucking idiot. What an idiot.
[300.61s -> 309.40s]  All right, now do me a favor, Gary. Fucking freeze. He's not freezing.
[309.40s -> 319.51s]  Is this guy immune to cold? Why is it? Why do I freeze in here but he doesn't? That's bullshit.
[319.51s -> 328.64s]  Gary. Put the guy on the chair. He won't even suspect a goddamn thing.
[328.64s -> 342.64s]  I wasn't supposed to kill that guy. It's easy.
[342.64s -> 350.10s]  Hey, I'm not doing anything in here. Are you seriously wondering how that guy died?
[350.10s -> 355.99s]  You opened the door and I did it. Don't fuck with the chef.
[355.99s -> 362.56s]  0800 hours. My mission is to find the mole.
[362.56s -> 366.56s]  I've got to be quick. I've got to be silent and unseen.
[366.56s -> 372.31s]  I find my target. He's this guy. I throw a piece of china right in his mouth.
[372.31s -> 379.18s]  Mission accomplished. I can now escape undetected.
[379.18s -> 383.26s]  You know, I really wish they would play something else.
[383.26s -> 388.26s]  You're right, Jerry. And I agree. I think this piano player really needs to shut the fuck up.
[388.26s -> 392.69s]  Get some rock music in here. You know what I'm saying?
[392.69s -> 406.55s]  I'm just being annoying right now. That's all I'm doing.
[406.55s -> 409.56s]  I'm just ruining these people's dinner.
[409.56s -> 418.46s]  How am I going to go about... Excuse me. Excuse me.
[418.46s -> 422.14s]  Are you serious? Occupied. Get out of here.
[422.14s -> 424.14s]  What are you doing? Get away from me.
[424.14s -> 431.27s]  Oh, good afternoon. Yeah, there's somebody in this one.
[431.27s -> 435.02s]  Yeah, no, somebody's still in it. Thank you for understanding.
[435.02s -> 441.21s]  Second time. Third time. He doesn't... He's going to piss in my face.
