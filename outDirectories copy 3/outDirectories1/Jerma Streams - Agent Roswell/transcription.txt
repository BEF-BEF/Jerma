[3.77s -> 7.59s]  All right, I want to get a controller for this one.
[10.25s -> 12.33s]  This seems like a controller game, so I'm going to use it.
[13.05s -> 22.09s]  Oh, the chopsticks. Shit. Yeah, we'll do that later.
[22.09s -> 25.80s]  Don't let me forget that. I'll do it. I promise.
[26.36s -> 28.82s]  Just I can't right now. I'm ready to go.
[28.82s -> 36.31s]  I'll make sure the audio is not loud. All right, let's go.
[37.03s -> 43.64s]  Hey, I got to change the... Do I have to change the title?
[43.64s -> 51.83s]  The title right now.
[51.83s -> 52.95s]  Being more considerate.
[54.41s -> 55.45s]  Oh, I think that's fine.
[57.50s -> 58.70s]  I'll do it. I promise.
[58.70s -> 69.08s]  Hold on.
[69.08s -> 70.44s]  The game has to change though.
[71.00s -> 74.52s]  Stream info. All right.
[75.16s -> 79.48s]  This is going to change to Roswell Agent.
[82.17s -> 83.85s]  Agent Roswell. There it is.
[83.85s -> 84.97s]  That's the name of this game, right?
[90.60s -> 93.72s]  Yeah, okay. All right. Coming back.
[95.56s -> 97.16s]  I can use chopsticks. Yes, I can.
[99.86s -> 103.48s]  This is... Oh, there we go. Okay.
[108.58s -> 111.14s]  I don't know how bad this audio is going to be. I have no idea.
[111.70s -> 115.90s]  Okay, new game.
[115.90s -> 123.59s]  Does the controller even work?
[123.59s -> 125.11s]  Hey, okay, hold on. Does this work?
[131.62s -> 132.90s]  No face cam? You'll get it later.
[144.23s -> 145.35s]  Long drive two?
[148.15s -> 149.19s]  There's a car in this game.
[149.19s -> 150.87s]  I don't know if it's exactly what you think it is.
[163.14s -> 176.97s]  Going after the power? All right.
[183.00s -> 186.62s]  Am I moving this? No, I don't think so.
[186.62s -> 199.99s]  Okay, there's a person over there.
[199.99s -> 203.77s]  Is this me? Oh, fuck. It's WASD.
[205.34s -> 207.64s]  Shit, I can't use the controller.
[207.64s -> 208.76s]  Power to the base is cutting out.
[208.76s -> 211.80s]  Take a Jeep to the electrical substation on the hill and check it out.
[211.80s -> 217.34s]  Okay, left shift is run. Mouse look.
[217.34s -> 219.26s]  Change controls after prologue.
[219.26s -> 222.92s]  Pick up, activate. Have a gun.
[225.13s -> 227.13s]  Jump and break. Pick up, activate.
[228.18s -> 237.83s]  Fire weapon. Okay, pick up.
[237.83s -> 242.63s]  This is a first-person shooter?
[242.63s -> 244.55s]  I thought this was like a third-person game.
[244.55s -> 249.21s]  Okay, I need to get the Jeep.
[249.21s -> 251.37s]  Oh, first and th- You can switch?
[253.03s -> 254.63s]  Holy shit. Okay, this is awesome.
[257.19s -> 259.19s]  Okay, zoom, unzoom, yep.
[259.75s -> 261.03s]  Menu, mission.
[261.03s -> 262.63s]  Power to the base is cutting out.
[262.63s -> 264.71s]  Take a Jeep to the electrical substation on the hill.
[265.66s -> 267.26s]  Inventory. Okay.
[267.82s -> 269.99s]  Change controls.
[269.99s -> 272.15s]  It's like weapon type. Reload, scroll as weapon.
[274.17s -> 275.13s]  C is kick.
[275.13s -> 277.45s]  There's a kick, okay.
[277.45s -> 283.75s]  Roll. Are these other- Who are these people?
[283.75s -> 285.24s]  Did we work together?
[287.08s -> 291.51s]  Melee? Do I work with these people?
[293.05s -> 299.11s]  Grenade? Are these enemies or are these people that-
[299.11s -> 301.35s]  I don't- I know. I don't have grenades.
[301.91s -> 305.91s]  Grenade type? Okay.
[305.91s -> 306.63s]  I need a Jeep.
[307.27s -> 312.36s]  These are my- These are like good guys, right?
[312.36s -> 313.08s]  We're on the same team?
[314.78s -> 315.66s]  I think we're on the same team.
[316.30s -> 325.83s]  All right, I need a Jeep.
[325.83s -> 328.95s]  Where's there a Je- I can run faster than a car can drive, okay?
[330.23s -> 330.95s]  That's a Jeep?
[331.51s -> 336.54s]  This is not a Jeep.
[336.54s -> 337.50s]  Where's her Jeep?
[346.10s -> 351.29s]  Back at the tower?
[351.29s -> 352.57s]  Oh shit, there's a Jeep right there.
[356.63s -> 357.91s]  Okay, I got a Jeep.
[357.91s -> 361.70s]  Ladies and gentlemen, plus one letter grade.
[361.70s -> 363.18s]  Okay, drive.
[363.18s -> 365.66s]  While driving, use return to recover your vehicle if stuck.
[379.67s -> 380.31s]  You can do it.
[386.23s -> 388.79s]  Drive to the electrical grid on the what?
[388.79s -> 393.18s]  Oh, it's over there.
[393.18s -> 401.14s]  Is there- Can I do- I can't do first person with this.
[405.13s -> 410.62s]  All right, I got it.
[410.62s -> 411.90s]  Nice. Okay, cool.
[411.90s -> 417.86s]  So I'd go in here and turn off the electricity?
[417.86s -> 418.90s]  Activate- Activated.
[420.81s -> 445.46s]  Oh! Can I kill it from here?
[445.46s -> 447.58s]  It's smoking.
[447.58s -> 448.78s]  Holy shit, it's an alien.
[448.78s -> 458.31s]  What am I supposed to do about this?
[463.08s -> 465.29s]  Okay, what's my task?
[465.29s -> 473.43s]  Oh shit, hold on.
[473.43s -> 474.71s]  He's running.
[474.71s -> 480.49s]  Okay.
[480.49s -> 485.19s]  Reset the circuit breaker.
[485.19s -> 488.15s]  You drive to that crash site and investigate wreckage.
[488.15s -> 489.11s]  What crash site?
[489.11s -> 491.40s]  Oh shit, all right, let's go.
[497.26s -> 498.22s]  They come in peace?
[502.36s -> 503.16s]  Oh, come on.
[506.47s -> 508.39s]  All right, it crashed over here?
[508.39s -> 509.35s]  I didn't even see it crash.
[527.64s -> 529.08s]  Let's get on the road, please.
[529.08s -> 539.64s]  I only have 30 bullets.
[539.64s -> 540.60s]  Is that bad?
[540.60s -> 558.14s]  All right, check for survivors at the crash site.
[558.14s -> 560.30s]  Keep a lookout to the sky for more.
[560.30s -> 562.18s]  All right, let's see if there's anybody here.
[562.18s -> 565.03s]  Anybody here?
[565.03s -> 578.18s]  LAPD, open up.
[578.18s -> 579.78s]  Okay, I don't know what's going on there, but-
[579.78s -> 585.61s]  There's nobody alive here.
[585.61s -> 586.17s]  Okay, whatever.
[586.17s -> 587.53s]  This is destroyed.
[587.53s -> 588.25s]  What about over here?
[588.25s -> 592.82s]  Are they like invading?
[592.82s -> 594.10s]  There's a shitload of them.
[594.10s -> 600.70s]  What the- Okay.
[603.21s -> 608.65s]  What the fuck is happening?
[608.65s -> 609.93s]  Help! Somebody help me!
[616.42s -> 617.70s]  I have no ammo left.
[617.70s -> 618.74s]  What the fuck?
[618.74s -> 628.94s]  They're going to like cut into me.
[646.39s -> 647.67s]  Okay, what just happened?
[647.67s -> 648.55s]  What did they do?
[648.55s -> 652.15s]  What did they just do to me?
[652.15s -> 654.07s]  They turned the contrast up.
[654.07s -> 659.77s]  After first contact with the visitors in Roswell
[659.77s -> 661.53s]  and the abduction of a military sergeant,
[661.53s -> 664.81s]  a task force is created to deal with the possible threat of alien invaders.
[665.37s -> 667.77s]  That task force is known as BATE,
[667.77s -> 671.11s]  the Bureau for Alien Investigation and Termination.
[671.11s -> 672.63s]  As the son of the missing sergeant,
[672.63s -> 676.07s]  you enroll to become an elite operative of the bureau.
[676.07s -> 678.87s]  After the Apollo moon landings in July 1969,
[678.87s -> 682.14s]  UFO activity spikes as reports and sightings
[682.14s -> 684.54s]  are flooding into the visitors returning,
[684.54s -> 687.00s]  clearly in great numbers and strength.
[687.00s -> 688.84s]  Your job is to investigate these incidents
[688.84s -> 692.30s]  and terminate any- anybody that's extraterrestrial.
[692.30s -> 695.18s]  Well, the bureau creates a long-term strategy to deal with them.
[695.18s -> 698.01s]  You are Agent Roswell.
[698.01s -> 698.73s]  Okay.
[698.73s -> 702.03s]  Hello?
[720.89s -> 721.39s]  Okay.
[722.94s -> 723.98s]  My computer.
[723.98s -> 725.02s]  Wait, what about the ball game?
[727.88s -> 729.08s]  Welcome to A-
[729.08s -> 732.71s]  What?
[732.71s -> 736.52s]  What the fuck?
[736.52s -> 738.79s]  This is spoilers.
[738.79s -> 739.94s]  No, exit.
[741.00s -> 741.96s]  Exit. That's spoilers.
[742.52s -> 744.65s]  I don't want to see those.
[748.73s -> 751.21s]  Arm 1, City 1, Desert 1, Pine Valley.
[752.26s -> 752.90s]  Side mission.
[753.46s -> 755.38s]  All right, let's do City 1.
[755.38s -> 759.06s]  We've identified a group of radicals who call themselves CETA,
[759.06s -> 761.06s]  supporters of extraterrestrial arrivals.
[761.62s -> 765.46s]  This group intends to contact or signal the aliens to land on Earth.
[765.46s -> 767.54s]  They believe they will bring about a new world order
[767.54s -> 769.54s]  free from governments and capitalism.
[769.54s -> 772.58s]  They have been trying to rally support for their cause around the city.
[772.58s -> 774.82s]  They've also stolen sensitive documents from another agent.
[775.88s -> 780.12s]  Disband all CETA activity in the city and get back to the documents.
[780.12s -> 789.30s]  It's a level creator?
[789.30s -> 798.14s]  So these people are working with the aliens.
[798.14s -> 799.34s]  All right, I have a radar.
[802.26s -> 805.30s]  Get in your car stored in the underground car park.
[815.54s -> 817.62s]  I can kick- I can like fucking kick people.
[817.62s -> 818.10s]  I don't want to-
[819.72s -> 820.76s]  Oh my god, put that down.
[820.76s -> 821.40s]  Put that down.
[821.40s -> 821.88s]  Put that down.
[821.88s -> 822.68s]  How do I put things away?
[823.16s -> 824.68s]  How do I put weapons away?
[824.68s -> 825.72s]  How do I put weapons away?
[826.36s -> 827.32s]  How do you put a weapon away?
[828.30s -> 828.70s]  I don't know.
[829.34s -> 833.30s]  Can I just take any car?
[836.04s -> 837.48s]  I can't just steal a car?
[837.48s -> 838.12s]  Yeah, I can.
[838.12s -> 839.08s]  What's wrong with this one?
[839.72s -> 840.87s]  The police?
[846.58s -> 848.18s]  I don't think it matters what car I take.
[848.82s -> 851.34s]  But I'm absolutely taking the motorcycle.
[851.90s -> 853.83s]  There's no way I'm not taking this.
[857.22s -> 857.72s]  Okay.
[859.22s -> 860.50s]  Police, I need to-
[862.02s -> 863.06s]  Stop, stop, stop it.
[863.78s -> 867.29s]  I need that bike.
[867.29s -> 868.01s]  I need the bike.
[868.01s -> 868.57s]  I need the bike.
[868.57s -> 869.13s]  I want the bike.
[886.97s -> 887.61s]  No.
[887.61s -> 888.11s]  Okay.
[888.81s -> 890.09s]  Can I get the motorcycle?
[890.81s -> 892.51s]  Shit.
[893.37s -> 893.77s]  I don't think-
[893.77s -> 894.65s]  Can I turn it around?
[895.45s -> 899.00s]  I don't think I can get it to turn.
[903.32s -> 904.36s]  Holy shit.
[904.36s -> 905.48s]  Oh my god, that was awful.
[907.08s -> 907.72s]  Where did she go?
[911.74s -> 912.30s]  Fuck you.
[913.67s -> 914.39s]  What?
[914.39s -> 915.27s]  It just disappears.
[916.07s -> 917.66s]  All right, just give me my car.
[918.22s -> 924.46s]  That was a gunshot.
[925.64s -> 927.32s]  Why am I kicking gunshots?
[933.00s -> 935.24s]  Why is like 30 people screaming?
[939.53s -> 940.49s]  Holy shit.
[940.49s -> 941.13s]  What?
[941.13s -> 943.53s]  Oh my god, that's so much blood.
[943.53s -> 944.89s]  That was so much blood.
[945.61s -> 947.85s]  There was just not that much blood inside of somebody.
[948.89s -> 950.01s]  Holy f-
[950.01s -> 950.89s]  Oh my god.
[951.45s -> 951.95s]  Okay.
[957.56s -> 958.06s]  Can I eat?
[958.68s -> 960.01s]  How much does food cost?
[963.37s -> 964.41s]  How do I get under there?
[971.66s -> 973.50s]  That like stock scream.
[974.30s -> 976.23s]  How do I go underground?
[983.16s -> 983.96s]  No, don't-
[983.96s -> 984.76s]  Is there like a subway?
[995.29s -> 996.41s]  How do I get underground?
[997.05s -> 1001.77s]  This bus cannot figure out what's going on
[1001.77s -> 1003.29s]  because the thing's in the way.
[1003.29s -> 1004.01s]  What are they doing?
[1004.01s -> 1004.81s]  Why are they fighting?
[1005.45s -> 1006.65s]  What is this guy doing?
[1023.29s -> 1024.57s]  Hit the eject button.
[1025.61s -> 1026.97s]  The guy ejected.
[1030.62s -> 1031.42s]  I'm gonna steal this
[1031.42s -> 1033.58s]  because this guy has no idea what's going on.
[1033.58s -> 1037.40s]  All right, get out of the car.
[1037.40s -> 1038.04s]  Get out of the car.
[1038.84s -> 1039.32s]  That's enough.
[1039.96s -> 1040.46s]  Get out.
[1041.90s -> 1042.62s]  Get out of the car.
[1045.80s -> 1046.30s]  What?
[1046.76s -> 1048.75s]  Where did you come from?
[1048.75s -> 1049.79s]  You spawned as-
[1053.87s -> 1054.37s]  What?
[1071.60s -> 1073.68s]  Why is your car so much more armor?
[1091.13s -> 1093.05s]  All right, I'm playing the game.
[1093.05s -> 1094.09s]  I hear a helicopter.
[1094.73s -> 1096.50s]  Why is there a-
[1100.86s -> 1103.10s]  Why is this game Grand Theft Auto?
[1103.10s -> 1108.22s]  This just became a really just low grade Grand Theft Auto.
[1108.78s -> 1113.05s]  Okay, well I'm just-
[1113.05s -> 1114.49s]  I don't know where this thing is.
[1115.13s -> 1116.81s]  I don't know how to get to the underground lair.
[1116.81s -> 1117.61s]  I have no idea.
[1120.44s -> 1121.56s]  Now there's a problem.
[1130.76s -> 1131.26s]  God.
[1132.04s -> 1133.16s]  What is he doing?
[1133.16s -> 1133.66s]  Okay.
[1137.28s -> 1138.40s]  I need to get this car.
[1140.91s -> 1141.41s]  What?
[1142.52s -> 1143.16s]  No!
[1143.16s -> 1144.68s]  It's not in this game.
[1144.68s -> 1146.28s]  It's impossible.
[1146.28s -> 1147.72s]  It's literally impossible.
[1148.44s -> 1149.56s]  It's impossible.
[1149.56s -> 1150.36s]  Are you serious?
[1150.36s -> 1151.24s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[1163.88s -> 1165.72s]  Is it the same person?
[1165.72s -> 1166.36s]  I don't know.
[1167.71s -> 1169.07s]  Why did you put this in here?
[1174.59s -> 1175.87s]  I can't fucking believe it.
[1175.87s -> 1177.15s]  I am shocked right now.
[1178.68s -> 1180.12s]  It's something that felt real familiar.
[1180.12s -> 1180.68s]  I'll be honest.
[1181.32s -> 1184.44s]  I want the bike.
[1185.08s -> 1191.00s]  I want the bike.
[1191.56s -> 1194.80s]  Is that actually in the game?
[1194.80s -> 1195.68s]  Yeah, it is.
[1195.68s -> 1196.48s]  What is that guy just-
[1196.48s -> 1197.52s]  Why is that guy floating around?
[1198.24s -> 1204.70s]  I cannot ride bikes.
[1213.10s -> 1213.82s]  It's down there.
[1213.82s -> 1214.32s]  Okay.
[1218.04s -> 1219.48s]  If you guys don't know why I just freaked out,
[1220.44s -> 1222.20s]  that's in Grab That Auto 5.
[1222.84s -> 1224.91s]  It's an old video I made.
[1224.91s -> 1227.31s]  We played a bunch of shitty GTA clones
[1227.31s -> 1230.43s]  and that song appeared in like four or five of them in a row.
[1233.47s -> 1234.83s]  Oh, that's shocking to see that.
[1235.55s -> 1243.15s]  Seeing what happens.
[1243.71s -> 1246.81s]  All right, so where's my car?
[1247.53s -> 1251.88s]  Yeah, like five years ago.
[1252.60s -> 1253.48s]  All right.
[1253.48s -> 1257.87s]  What the fuck?
[1257.87s -> 1259.31s]  I can't fucking believe it.
[1260.03s -> 1264.12s]  What does it want me to do?
[1266.19s -> 1268.67s]  Get in your car in the underground car park.
[1268.67s -> 1269.39s]  Where is my car?
[1274.75s -> 1275.63s]  Oh, is that it?
[1276.35s -> 1293.21s]  Yeah, I did not just put a-
[1293.21s -> 1294.01s]  That's not my car.
[1297.21s -> 1299.77s]  Oh, destroy three protest rally trucks.
[1318.20s -> 1321.56s]  So these are the people that want the aliens to take over.
[1321.56s -> 1322.92s]  Is that what I'm understanding?
[1325.87s -> 1327.95s]  My fucking right ear hurts.
[1327.95s -> 1328.45s]  Ow.
[1329.31s -> 1329.81s]  Ow.
[1331.80s -> 1333.00s]  What the fuck?
[1333.00s -> 1334.20s]  Wait, why do I have this?
[1335.93s -> 1337.13s]  Oh my god.
[1344.19s -> 1346.11s]  Why is all of a sudden it's a James Bond car?
[1356.64s -> 1357.36s]  What is it saying?
[1359.34s -> 1360.14s]  Abduct me.
[1361.79s -> 1363.31s]  Aliens, come in peace.
[1363.31s -> 1363.95s]  Abduct me.
[1371.60s -> 1372.24s]  No, I put-
[1372.24s -> 1372.80s]  I don't want this.
[1372.80s -> 1373.52s]  I don't want to put that out.
[1374.24s -> 1375.20s]  I want to read the signs.
[1375.76s -> 1377.53s]  What does it say?
[1381.31s -> 1382.83s]  Extraterrestrials are here.
[1384.01s -> 1384.81s]  Welcome to Earth.
[1385.45s -> 1391.96s]  I love UFOs.
[1391.96s -> 1394.04s]  I mean, they're not doing anything wrong.
[1394.04s -> 1395.72s]  Like, what's illegal about this?
[1398.75s -> 1400.19s]  The aliens are attacking.
[1407.76s -> 1408.56s]  Beam me up.
[1409.20s -> 1413.48s]  How do I do-
[1413.48s -> 1415.32s]  I have to destroy these?
[1416.04s -> 1421.79s]  Where's my car?
[1424.99s -> 1425.87s]  Beam me up.
[1426.43s -> 1435.07s]  Things were different in the 50s.
[1439.05s -> 1440.73s]  I need to, like, knock out their truck?
[1441.45s -> 1443.23s]  Did I do it?
[1443.79s -> 1452.59s]  Abduct me now.
[1453.31s -> 1455.52s]  I mean, look, if somebody wanted the aliens to abduct him,
[1455.52s -> 1457.28s]  like, I can't tell you not to do that.
[1458.08s -> 1460.30s]  Do they want to, like, take over Earth?
[1460.94s -> 1471.66s]  Do you have the-
[1471.66s -> 1472.22s]  Oh, yeah, right.
[1487.16s -> 1488.78s]  Did I do anything?
[1489.42s -> 1496.96s]  Okay, I think I did it.
[1497.52s -> 1501.40s]  All right, watch out.
[1501.40s -> 1501.88s]  Get out of the way.
[1504.52s -> 1511.79s]  I mean, do we know the motive?
[1512.35s -> 1516.64s]  The briefing that we got said that they want the aliens to take over
[1516.64s -> 1519.44s]  and they want to, like, kill everybody and abduct everybody.
[1519.44s -> 1519.92s]  That's what we're-
[1519.92s -> 1521.04s]  That's what we're understanding.
[1530.19s -> 1531.47s]  Little green men are cool.
[1532.19s -> 1536.16s]  This is, like, people just-
[1536.16s -> 1536.48s]  This is-
[1536.48s -> 1536.88s]  This is-
[1539.98s -> 1541.74s]  I don't see anything going on that's wrong.
[1542.30s -> 1559.84s]  All right, I want to-
[1559.84s -> 1560.32s]  Watch out.
[1565.04s -> 1566.24s]  Little suss men.
[1569.13s -> 1570.49s]  Put the cars in the ocean?
[1570.49s -> 1570.73s]  Yeah.
[1583.60s -> 1585.12s]  You're supposed to be wrong.
[1585.12s -> 1586.00s]  That's what's wrong.
[1589.08s -> 1590.52s]  Move, move, move.
[1590.52s -> 1591.00s]  Out of the way.
[1593.63s -> 1594.11s]  Oh, boy.
[1597.00s -> 1598.60s]  This would be a great time for you to move out of the way.
[1601.15s -> 1602.11s]  Move out of the way.
[1602.11s -> 1602.51s]  Good.
[1602.51s -> 1602.83s]  All right.
[1604.30s -> 1605.82s]  You're going to soft lock yourself?
[1606.70s -> 1607.58s]  I don't think I am.
[1608.30s -> 1609.98s]  This is going right into the ocean.
[1616.36s -> 1617.24s]  Okay, I think I have to-
[1617.88s -> 1619.74s]  I have to ditch both cars.
[1620.54s -> 1622.17s]  Oh, fuck.
[1622.17s -> 1623.05s]  Hold on.
[1623.05s -> 1632.32s]  Is there an invisible wall?
[1633.68s -> 1634.16s]  No, all right.
[1634.72s -> 1649.37s]  What happened to this person?
[1650.70s -> 1651.26s]  Watch out.
[1651.98s -> 1664.00s]  Why are there just people lying on the ground?
[1664.00s -> 1664.96s]  Like, ran over.
[1665.68s -> 1681.24s]  Why am I driving the taxi?
[1681.24s -> 1681.64s]  I don't know.
[1682.20s -> 1683.48s]  Because it was available.
[1683.48s -> 1699.48s]  Okay.
[1699.48s -> 1703.52s]  Move this out of the way.
[1704.24s -> 1708.91s]  What did I-
[1708.91s -> 1709.63s]  Did I-
[1709.63s -> 1710.99s]  Is that the mission complete music?
[1713.87s -> 1714.59s]  I can't tell.
[1717.47s -> 1718.11s]  No, no, it's just-
[1718.11s -> 1719.15s]  Okay, it's regular music.
[1719.71s -> 1725.45s]  Okay.
[1726.09s -> 1726.81s]  I have to destroy it.
[1729.92s -> 1731.12s]  I want to get some more info here.
[1738.92s -> 1739.64s]  Oh my god.
[1740.28s -> 1744.32s]  All right, I'm good.
[1744.32s -> 1747.44s]  Shut down the illegal pirate radio broadcasters
[1747.44s -> 1748.96s]  attempting to signal the aliens.
[1756.78s -> 1759.26s]  But people are just trying to signal the aliens?
[1759.26s -> 1760.86s]  Have the aliens attacked yet?
[1764.78s -> 1765.58s]  I need a little-
[1765.58s -> 1767.90s]  I need to understand more of what's going on.
[1767.90s -> 1769.34s]  Have the aliens attacked yet?
[1771.63s -> 1772.19s]  They have?
[1772.19s -> 1772.83s]  At the start of the game?
[1772.83s -> 1774.59s]  Did they attack like a city?
[1774.59s -> 1778.32s]  They literally killed your father.
[1778.32s -> 1778.80s]  Oh, okay.
[1788.86s -> 1790.54s]  What the fuck was that?
[1790.54s -> 1791.04s]  Hey!
[1791.66s -> 1794.06s]  Who's shooting at me?
[1799.02s -> 1800.30s]  Oh, wait, that was-
[1800.30s -> 1803.40s]  What the fuck?
[1803.40s -> 1813.24s]  So this is the radio tower.
[1813.24s -> 1815.16s]  So they're trying to signal the aliens.
[1815.16s -> 1820.75s]  My fucking head.
[1820.75s -> 1821.55s]  That was so loud.
[1828.46s -> 1829.18s]  Is it fall damage?
[1830.49s -> 1831.29s]  Yep.
[1831.29s -> 1834.16s]  Watch out.
[1834.16s -> 1846.06s]  I swear to god, you walk faster than driving.
[1846.06s -> 1852.11s]  I kind of want to skateboard or something too though.
[1852.11s -> 1859.12s]  I did not want to do that.
[1859.12s -> 1870.27s]  Can I not take the skateboard?
[1870.27s -> 1872.11s]  So where are the aliens now?
[1872.11s -> 1881.44s]  All right, get up here.
[1881.44s -> 1895.64s]  Are you gonna shoot me?
[1895.64s -> 1896.76s]  Yep, he's trying to shoot me.
[1915.21s -> 1916.01s]  How do you dodge roll?
[1917.21s -> 1917.71s]  Okay.
[1918.09s -> 1924.89s]  All right, I shot him in the fucking head.
[1925.53s -> 1943.18s]  All right, so it's like-
[1943.74s -> 1944.89s]  Is there anybody up here?
[1948.20s -> 1949.80s]  I don't even know how to react to this game.
[1954.33s -> 1956.41s]  Uh-oh, ultimate fall joke incoming.
[1956.41s -> 1956.97s]  I saw it.
[1956.97s -> 1957.69s]  I saw it.
[1957.69s -> 1958.65s]  Do you think I'll die?
[1958.65s -> 1960.97s]  What do you think?
[1960.97s -> 1969.58s]  Is this a fall that will kill me?
[1969.58s -> 1970.08s]  Nope.
[1973.37s -> 1974.09s]  Okay, we're fine.
[1974.65s -> 1981.42s]  All right, there's a guy on the roof though.
[1981.42s -> 1984.59s]  I have to be aware.
[1984.59s -> 1987.15s]  And if he shoots me once, I'm dead.
[1987.15s -> 1993.42s]  This thing is giving me like anxiety.
[1993.42s -> 1994.70s]  I don't like how close it's getting.
[1994.70s -> 1995.90s]  I don't like how weird it's acting.
[1999.71s -> 2000.91s]  All right, can I aggro?
[2000.91s -> 2008.54s]  God damn it, he's gonna shoot me once and I'm gonna die.
[2008.54s -> 2017.05s]  You're up even higher.
[2017.05s -> 2020.92s]  Wait, where are you?
[2020.92s -> 2022.12s]  Are you just sitting right there?
[2022.12s -> 2038.11s]  I did it.
[2038.11s -> 2039.15s]  You've regen health over time.
[2039.15s -> 2040.27s]  Yeah, don't stand too close to this.
[2040.27s -> 2041.15s]  It's gonna explode and kill me.
[2042.36s -> 2044.70s]  All right, I'm on the rooftops.
[2044.70s -> 2047.10s]  The aliens don't have any more broadcasting equipment.
[2047.10s -> 2049.28s]  I stole sacred files from bait.
[2049.28s -> 2050.32s]  Retrieve them.
[2050.32s -> 2052.72s]  There's an activity in the industrial district.
[2052.72s -> 2054.16s]  Check the garages and roofs.
[2054.88s -> 2057.16s]  Where are the aliens?
[2068.17s -> 2069.61s]  You're the alien.
[2069.61s -> 2070.25s]  Where are they?
[2077.53s -> 2078.17s]  That's heavy.
[2078.17s -> 2079.05s]  That's heavy base.
[2079.87s -> 2080.91s]  I like the heavy base.
[2098.46s -> 2103.52s]  What else you got?
[2105.12s -> 2106.24s]  All right, I like it.
[2109.88s -> 2116.08s]  This feels very iPad gamey.
[2119.85s -> 2121.05s]  No, this is not porn music.
[2122.57s -> 2127.31s]  This is, watch out.
[2133.21s -> 2137.82s]  To me, this is first name, last name, dev on App Store.
[2138.54s -> 2145.00s]  It's not like, oh, Firestuff Studios.
[2145.00s -> 2152.65s]  No, this is first name, last name, dev on the App Store.
[2154.08s -> 2156.24s]  All right, so I have to stop them from, all right, let's stop them.
[2156.96s -> 2163.58s]  All right, there's one.
[2163.58s -> 2164.30s]  How many people?
[2164.30s -> 2166.30s]  I do have to get, this is not good.
[2169.60s -> 2170.24s]  Wait, recover.
[2183.16s -> 2184.12s]  You're under arrest.
[2188.96s -> 2191.40s]  Can I land on him, please?
[2199.42s -> 2199.92s]  I got him.
[2207.21s -> 2207.77s]  It hurts.
[2207.77s -> 2208.49s]  All right, hold on.
[2210.20s -> 2210.68s]  What's the goal?
[2211.32s -> 2213.48s]  Okay, all right, all right, all right.
[2213.48s -> 2214.84s]  I gotta get the boxes full of files.
[2224.59s -> 2225.31s]  Files in here.
[2239.64s -> 2240.36s]  Okay, got it.
[2241.76s -> 2242.56s]  Well, there's files.
[2244.22s -> 2244.94s]  What was even in here?
[2245.50s -> 2249.79s]  Is that gonna explode?
[2250.27s -> 2252.12s]  Of course it is, okay.
[2252.92s -> 2254.46s]  There's no files?
[2255.18s -> 2257.84s]  Where are these files?
[2258.40s -> 2267.26s]  There's nothing even in here.
[2267.26s -> 2270.88s]  Check the garages and the roofs.
[2272.54s -> 2276.67s]  Dude, this is literally Saints Row.
[2276.67s -> 2279.79s]  I should literally play Saints Row on stream.
[2279.79s -> 2280.27s]  Don't you think?
[2280.91s -> 2284.89s]  I should literally play Saints Row.
[2284.89s -> 2289.92s]  Any of these other ones open?
[2290.56s -> 2297.84s]  Only the first two?
[2298.48s -> 2300.52s]  Yeah, I'd play like Saints Row 2.
[2307.40s -> 2308.04s]  I'm out of bullets.
[2308.99s -> 2310.11s]  Okay, we're fine.
[2310.11s -> 2311.66s]  Give me that gun.
[2311.66s -> 2313.31s]  Give me that gun.
[2323.85s -> 2324.01s]  No!
[2324.01s -> 2325.45s]  No!
[2325.45s -> 2328.91s]  There's a shitload of people up there.
[2329.79s -> 2340.73s]  Give me that gun.
[2340.73s -> 2346.41s]  Can I not pick it up?
[2346.41s -> 2353.82s]  Please fall off so I don't have to...
[2354.46s -> 2356.72s]  I gotta get up there.
[2358.86s -> 2360.38s]  I don't even know how many files I have to find.
[2362.49s -> 2363.77s]  Oh, shit, there we go.
[2363.77s -> 2366.14s]  Okay, how many more?
[2366.14s -> 2367.50s]  Recovered a box.
[2367.50s -> 2369.15s]  I think there's one or two more, maybe?
[2369.71s -> 2371.64s]  Play two, three, and four.
[2371.64s -> 2372.76s]  I at least wanna do two and three.
[2376.00s -> 2377.04s]  Absolutely, without a doubt.
[2377.60s -> 2393.74s]  How the fuck am I...
[2393.74s -> 2397.18s]  How was I supposed to do that?
[2397.18s -> 2398.86s]  How was I ever supposed to do that?
[2398.86s -> 2399.82s]  Are you serious?
[2399.82s -> 2414.64s]  I don't even know missions yet.
[2416.52s -> 2417.40s]  Oh, fuck off.
[2417.40s -> 2417.72s]  Really?
[2419.93s -> 2421.93s]  Oh, what?
[2421.93s -> 2427.88s]  I wanna see the aliens.
[2427.88s -> 2432.70s]  All right, no fucking around.
[2432.70s -> 2433.34s]  I'm doing this quick.
[2433.34s -> 2434.14s]  I wanna see aliens.
[2434.14s -> 2435.18s]  Yeah, no more fucking around.
[2435.18s -> 2435.82s]  We're keeping this on.
[2437.68s -> 2439.68s]  I'm trying to not take one point of damage.
[2440.48s -> 2475.55s]  I can't believe this game fucked everything up.
[2475.55s -> 2483.12s]  It's got tire marks all over his butt.
[2483.12s -> 2483.62s]  Okay.
[2491.82s -> 2492.38s]  Can't fire?
[2493.20s -> 2493.68s]  Can't shoot.
[2494.88s -> 2498.38s]  I thought this car had guns.
[2513.50s -> 2514.14s]  Did I?
[2514.14s -> 2527.60s]  Okay, I'm stuck under here.
[2527.60s -> 2528.72s]  Get the fuck out of here!
[2529.36s -> 2531.68s]  I think he crushed his head.
[2532.48s -> 2532.96s]  Jesus.
[2534.83s -> 2536.03s]  Why do I have a sniper?
[2536.83s -> 2540.20s]  Where did I get a sniper rifle from?
[2541.00s -> 2547.36s]  How are you still alive?
[2547.36s -> 2548.24s]  I don't understand.
[2569.87s -> 2570.37s]  Okay.
[2572.36s -> 2573.48s]  This game sucks.
[2575.32s -> 2577.72s]  We can't review the game until we get to see the aliens.
[2577.72s -> 2578.28s]  Don't you...
[2578.28s -> 2584.36s]  I can't review it until we see aliens on the screen.
[2584.36s -> 2585.56s]  Hold off your judgments.
[2585.56s -> 2586.36s]  Hold them now.
[2586.36s -> 2596.65s]  Wait, this is a shotgun.
[2596.65s -> 2604.80s]  This weapon sucks.
[2604.80s -> 2606.24s]  Absolute fucking ass.
[2606.24s -> 2606.80s]  Are you kidding me?
[2609.98s -> 2610.70s]  What just happened?
[2611.63s -> 2612.75s]  Somebody's car exploded.
[2618.68s -> 2619.00s]  What?
[2620.46s -> 2622.14s]  What is this head lean?
[2622.14s -> 2623.34s]  I shot him right in the head.
[2624.06s -> 2628.97s]  Throw a grenade?
[2628.97s -> 2630.01s]  I don't have any grenades.
[2630.57s -> 2637.56s]  This is fucked you.
[2637.56s -> 2638.36s]  God damn it.
[2639.95s -> 2640.59s]  He's gonna kill me.
[2640.59s -> 2641.23s]  He's gonna kill me.
[2641.23s -> 2649.96s]  It's over.
[2649.96s -> 2651.08s]  This sucks.
[2651.08s -> 2658.33s]  What the fuck?
[2658.33s -> 2658.89s]  How?
[2658.89s -> 2661.21s]  He's inside of the thing.
[2661.21s -> 2662.81s]  He's inside?
[2662.81s -> 2674.38s]  Jeremiah, I don't think there's gonna be aliens.
[2674.38s -> 2675.18s]  There's gonna be aliens.
[2675.18s -> 2675.90s]  You have to wait.
[2675.90s -> 2682.59s]  I have a sniper rifle.
[2682.59s -> 2684.27s]  I'm just gonna snipe from like another building.
[2685.77s -> 2686.27s]  Yeah.
[2686.49s -> 2687.85s]  I'm just sniping from another building.
[2688.41s -> 2690.57s]  I'm climbing up and I'm gonna snipe.
[2690.57s -> 2700.78s]  Did you pay for this?
[2700.78s -> 2701.34s]  Yes, I did.
[2705.05s -> 2705.93s]  I think it's...
[2705.93s -> 2706.81s]  I think it's gonna be fun.
[2707.77s -> 2708.97s]  We have to get out of this segment.
[2709.61s -> 2711.04s]  Just trust me.
[2711.04s -> 2711.60s]  You gotta trust.
[2712.16s -> 2713.90s]  It's hard.
[2713.90s -> 2715.50s]  Okay, this is really hard to drive.
[2715.50s -> 2716.94s]  It just skids around all over the place.
[2716.94s -> 2717.18s]  Why?
[2717.18s -> 2718.06s]  Is the handbrake on?
[2718.94s -> 2721.87s]  I would not be driving it like this.
[2722.51s -> 2735.68s]  Okay, I gotta climb up somewhere.
[2737.23s -> 2738.19s]  I want a good view.
[2738.83s -> 2753.69s]  Let's get off.
[2753.69s -> 2764.01s]  There's only one guy up here.
[2776.91s -> 2777.63s]  Fucking god.
[2778.19s -> 2786.96s]  This fucking game.
[2787.52s -> 2806.80s]  I shot him in the head.
[2806.80s -> 2809.07s]  I shot him in his head.
[2809.79s -> 2810.43s]  In his head.
[2811.07s -> 2816.11s]  Oh my god.
[2816.83s -> 2827.77s]  Give me the sniper.
[2827.77s -> 2830.88s]  Sniper.
[2830.88s -> 2833.40s]  Give me the fucking sniper rifle.
[2833.40s -> 2834.12s]  Which one is it?
[2834.76s -> 2864.49s]  Oh, give me this weapon.
[2864.49s -> 2872.36s]  Okay, shooting people in the head doesn't matter.
[2872.36s -> 2889.90s]  Okay, good.
[2889.90s -> 2892.43s]  Now, are there plans up here?
[2892.43s -> 2894.03s]  I need to see the aliens in the city.
[2894.03s -> 2894.59s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[2894.59s -> 2903.48s]  This is how it works.
[2903.48s -> 2904.12s]  Here we go.
[2904.76s -> 2907.47s]  Plans.
[2907.47s -> 2908.27s]  Plans.
[2908.27s -> 2912.04s]  There are three or four...
[2912.04s -> 2913.24s]  There's a lot more plans.
[2913.24s -> 2914.52s]  Holy shit, this sucks.
[2914.52s -> 2916.83s]  All right, what about the other buildings?
[2917.07s -> 2922.08s]  There's two plans in this building.
[2922.08s -> 2927.13s]  There's aliens in the room with you right now.
[2927.77s -> 2928.33s]  They were.
[2928.33s -> 2931.05s]  You just saw me get like shocked or whatever, electrocuted.
[2931.61s -> 2952.03s]  I did mocap for this game.
[2952.03s -> 2952.59s]  Did you really?
[2960.16s -> 2960.80s]  Oh, nice.
[2961.44s -> 2962.80s]  You did the mocap?
[2962.80s -> 2967.77s]  I have to see an alien.
[2967.77s -> 2968.25s]  I'm sorry.
[2968.25s -> 2989.05s]  That's the way it is.
[2989.05s -> 2990.49s]  Real mocap actor.
[2990.49s -> 2991.88s]  That's pretty sick, dude.
[2992.44s -> 2996.32s]  What was it like?
[2996.32s -> 3000.54s]  Was it cool?
[3000.54s -> 3011.71s]  Where the fuck is this thing?
[3011.71s -> 3012.03s]  This...
[3012.03s -> 3013.07s]  It has to be one more.
[3013.07s -> 3013.39s]  Where?
[3013.95s -> 3025.00s]  It's in one of these random buildings.
[3025.00s -> 3025.88s]  Come on.
[3025.88s -> 3030.78s]  We're here.
[3030.78s -> 3033.39s]  Over here.
[3033.39s -> 3034.11s]  Okay, right here.
[3036.57s -> 3038.57s]  My neck just got so itchy for no reason.
[3042.57s -> 3050.19s]  No, other side.
[3050.19s -> 3050.67s]  All right.
[3050.67s -> 3051.63s]  Finally, this one's done.
[3052.49s -> 3055.80s]  Mission complete.
[3055.80s -> 3056.28s]  Thank God.
[3056.28s -> 3056.60s]  All right.
[3057.66s -> 3058.38s]  All right.
[3058.38s -> 3058.70s]  Nice.
[3067.47s -> 3068.27s]  Awesome.
[3068.27s -> 3071.28s]  Okay, city two.
[3071.28s -> 3074.86s]  We believe that the aliens have the ability to hide in plain sight.
[3074.86s -> 3078.14s]  Use the detector to identify any aliens disguised as pedestrians.
[3078.14s -> 3081.72s]  We report they're at three locations marked on your radar.
[3081.72s -> 3085.21s]  Exterminate any you uncover immediately.
[3085.21s -> 3099.95s]  I've had more fun watching you paint walls and house flipper.
[3099.95s -> 3101.95s]  Once I see the aliens, don't worry.
[3107.32s -> 3108.04s]  Hey, Beepo.
[3108.04s -> 3109.72s]  Thanks for the five community subs.
[3109.72s -> 3109.88s]  All right.
[3109.88s -> 3110.36s]  So this is my...
[3111.24s -> 3112.04s]  Get to the location.
[3112.04s -> 3113.64s]  So this determines if somebody's an alien.
[3114.52s -> 3118.86s]  Does this hurt?
[3122.81s -> 3124.17s]  This does not seem to hurt.
[3131.64s -> 3132.92s]  3090 omega low.
[3134.89s -> 3137.21s]  You really telling me 3090 omega low in a game like this?
[3143.21s -> 3146.17s]  Here comes day Dallas levels of subordination.
[3147.93s -> 3148.97s]  I don't think so.
[3148.97s -> 3149.77s]  Not even close.
[3169.74s -> 3170.06s]  All right.
[3170.62s -> 3171.74s]  Somebody over here is an alien.
[3176.01s -> 3177.13s]  Do I want other people to know?
[3182.89s -> 3183.77s]  Which one is an alien?
[3205.80s -> 3209.60s]  There's more?
[3209.60s -> 3213.26s]  How are there more aliens?
[3213.26s -> 3225.64s]  Do I go somewhere else?
[3226.20s -> 3227.29s]  What is what?
[3227.29s -> 3234.12s]  What is that?
[3234.12s -> 3234.60s]  Oh, shit.
[3239.36s -> 3240.88s]  Is it like a false alarm or does it actually do it?
[3256.19s -> 3256.91s]  Next location.
[3256.91s -> 3257.15s]  Okay.
[3259.12s -> 3261.12s]  We've seen the aliens now.
[3261.12s -> 3263.48s]  Now I need to check everybody.
[3263.48s -> 3264.12s]  Oh, shit.
[3298.96s -> 3300.68s]  You're ready to stay calm.
[3300.68s -> 3306.67s]  All right.
[3306.67s -> 3307.47s]  You're all clean.
[3307.47s -> 3309.87s]  It doesn't have another game prepared.
[3309.87s -> 3311.23s]  Omega low day.
[3312.03s -> 3315.95s]  You know, you've got a great eye.
[3316.83s -> 3317.71s]  You've got a great eye.
[3317.71s -> 3318.27s]  You should.
[3318.27s -> 3319.23s]  Yeah, you should.
[3322.22s -> 3323.82s]  It doesn't have anything else planned for today.
[3325.02s -> 3326.14s]  Well, not technically.
[3326.14s -> 3327.42s]  No, you didn't have anything else.
[3327.42s -> 3333.36s]  No, it's just the plan.
[3336.68s -> 3338.92s]  Although there are other actually there are other options,
[3339.85s -> 3341.45s]  but I want to play tomorrow.
[3344.41s -> 3345.21s]  I don't want to do the game.
[3345.21s -> 3346.57s]  I'm supposed to play tomorrow today.
[3347.45s -> 3349.63s]  You guys aliens?
[3350.19s -> 3360.88s]  Nobody.
[3360.88s -> 3361.12s]  Okay.
[3361.68s -> 3366.30s]  Let me see what else I got.
[3366.30s -> 3366.54s]  Okay.
[3367.18s -> 3368.94s]  I want to see one more area and then fine.
[3369.50s -> 3372.00s]  I want to see one more zone and then I'll be fine.
[3375.37s -> 3376.41s]  Jump King DLC?
[3376.41s -> 3377.69s]  No, not at a chance in hell.
[3377.69s -> 3378.65s]  Not in a million years.
[3380.27s -> 3380.59s]  Nope.
[3391.58s -> 3392.14s]  Pawn shop.
[3392.14s -> 3393.50s]  Yeah, the pawn shop game is tomorrow.
[3393.50s -> 3394.86s]  And I feel like that's an entire stream.
[3398.70s -> 3400.70s]  What we're looking for right now is a way to potentially
[3401.74s -> 3403.10s]  have another maybe like hour and a half.
[3403.66s -> 3407.68s]  I'm running people over.
[3408.24s -> 3414.92s]  All right.
[3414.92s -> 3415.48s]  It's down there.
[3419.39s -> 3420.03s]  What?
[3420.03s -> 3428.33s]  Where the where is it?
[3428.33s -> 3428.97s]  Deltarune?
[3428.97s -> 3430.09s]  I don't want to play Deltarune.
[3431.45s -> 3434.41s]  It's been so long since chapter one that I have to play chapter one
[3434.41s -> 3435.53s]  before I do chapter two again.
[3436.52s -> 3437.64s]  So we're going to do that next weekend.
[3439.16s -> 3440.44s]  I forget everything.
[3443.36s -> 3445.60s]  I don't want to jump into chapter two without I literally
[3445.60s -> 3447.28s]  I couldn't even tell you the main character's name is.
[3448.00s -> 3450.24s]  I couldn't tell you like this like three or four characters.
[3450.24s -> 3457.76s]  I have no idea what their names are.
[3457.76s -> 3460.08s]  What the fuck is how do I get down there?
[3461.90s -> 3462.30s]  Alien.
[3462.94s -> 3473.36s]  Is that not an alien?
[3473.36s -> 3479.85s]  That was an alien though.
[3479.85s -> 3480.17s]  All right.
[3480.17s -> 3482.62s]  Well, how do I get down?
[3491.08s -> 3497.90s]  Oh, it destroyed it destroyed all human.
[3499.74s -> 3500.46s]  Not this time.
[3501.10s -> 3502.81s]  I have no idea where the fuck is supposed to go.
[3504.14s -> 3504.70s]  He's not dead.
[3505.34s -> 3513.56s]  Apparently underground or down under somewhere.
[3513.56s -> 3514.68s]  I don't get it.
[3515.32s -> 3516.67s]  Like Picross.
[3518.03s -> 3518.67s]  We'll see what I have.
[3526.92s -> 3527.16s]  All right.
[3527.16s -> 3528.28s]  We'll switch games.
[3528.28s -> 3529.00s]  Don't worry.
[3529.80s -> 3530.76s]  Everybody relax.
[3530.76s -> 3532.76s]  I just wanted to see the aliens.
[3532.76s -> 3533.88s]  Everybody relax.
[3534.76s -> 3548.01s]  I don't know how to get.
[3548.01s -> 3548.25s]  Okay.
[3548.89s -> 3559.24s]  What about this farm and desert desert one?
[3559.24s -> 3560.36s]  All right.
[3560.36s -> 3560.68s]  Desert.
[3560.68s -> 3562.20s]  I just want to see the desert one.
[3562.20s -> 3567.71s]  Play the long drive.
[3567.71s -> 3576.22s]  No, I don't think so.
[3576.22s -> 3577.26s]  Check out the junkyard.
[3577.26s -> 3577.98s]  This is actually kind of cool.
[3594.11s -> 3595.87s]  Next game is just this game.
[3595.87s -> 3597.31s]  No, we'll play something else for like an hour.
[3597.31s -> 3607.85s]  I have to see if it's possible.
[3607.85s -> 3608.89s]  Every game of the gas station.
[3608.89s -> 3616.96s]  You need to know it works.
[3616.96s -> 3620.49s]  I can't move.
[3621.13s -> 3625.20s]  All right.
[3625.20s -> 3626.32s]  Let me see what I hold on.
[3626.32s -> 3626.64s]  Can I fly?
[3626.64s -> 3627.36s]  If you can fly a plane.
[3627.36s -> 3628.56s]  Look, give me a break, right?
[3628.56s -> 3629.12s]  Just hold on.
[3640.68s -> 3641.00s]  Really?
[3641.00s -> 3641.48s]  Come on.
[3641.48s -> 3643.16s]  Come on.
[3643.16s -> 3645.71s]  Ah, all right.
[3645.71s -> 3646.19s]  Fine.
[3646.19s -> 3646.51s]  Fine.
[3646.51s -> 3647.23s]  It was cool.
[3647.23s -> 3648.11s]  I liked it.
[3648.11s -> 3648.67s]  I liked it.
[3648.67s -> 3650.19s]  But I think we saw what we wanted to see.
[3650.19s -> 3651.23s]  And I'm going to move on.
[3651.23s -> 3660.94s]  We got minus two letter grade.
[3660.94s -> 3661.98s]  No, what are you talking about?
[3661.98s -> 3662.46s]  That's not fair.
[3668.44s -> 3669.56s]  That's not fair.
[3669.56s -> 3673.45s]  All right.
[3673.45s -> 3673.93s]  We got.
[3676.03s -> 3677.15s]  Oh, shit.
[3677.15s -> 3680.72s]  I have that stupid.
[3680.72s -> 3681.76s]  Well, not stupid.
[3681.76s -> 3683.72s]  No, I have this too.
[3683.72s -> 3685.58s]  I got this too.
[3685.58s -> 3685.82s]  All right.
[3687.02s -> 3690.57s]  By a show of hands, I downloaded this.
[3690.57s -> 3693.63s]  I downloaded this game the other day.
[3693.63s -> 3697.15s]  It's called Animal Ultimate Simulator Battle.
[3697.15s -> 3697.88s]  What's it called?
[3699.08s -> 3700.68s]  Animal Revolt Battle Sim.
[3701.24s -> 3706.16s]  It looked like it was kind of insane.
[3706.16s -> 3712.11s]  Is it a YouTuber game?
[3712.67s -> 3716.44s]  Is it a YouTuber game?
[3717.00s -> 3718.04s]  It's a YouTuber bait.
[3720.80s -> 3721.36s]  Let's try it.
[3721.36s -> 3721.68s]  Whatever.
[3722.40s -> 3723.36s]  I'm not playing the game.
[3723.36s -> 3724.48s]  I'm not playing Pawn Shop.
[3725.04s -> 3728.44s]  I want to play that tomorrow.
[3728.44s -> 3729.24s]  Get the chopsticks.
[3729.24s -> 3730.36s]  I'll get the chopsticks in a minute.
[3730.36s -> 3732.01s]  Before the stream ends, I promise.
[3732.01s -> 3733.36s]  All right, give me a second.
[3733.36s -> 3735.58s]  Let me open this game up.
[3735.58s -> 3737.18s]  See if this is like a funny game or not.
