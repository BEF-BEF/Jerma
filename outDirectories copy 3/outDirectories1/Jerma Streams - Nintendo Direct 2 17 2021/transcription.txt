[15.74s -> 25.72s]  All right. Hello? What is this? I'm not muted?
[25.72s -> 27.22s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[27.22s -> 37.99s]  I just turned the stream on. What do you mean I have 20 minutes before my solar system is destroyed?
[37.99s -> 46.56s]  Oh. It's like we just- I just turned the stream on. You have 20 minutes before the fucking solar system is destroyed, Jeremy.
[46.56s -> 52.38s]  You're five minutes late. No audio? Oh, there we go.
[58.38s -> 60.88s]  I didn't even know there was a direct today. I had no idea.
[60.88s -> 61.88s]  I don't even watch these.
[68.70s -> 75.96s]  Wait, did they spoil the game? I'm so disheveled right now. I haven't even brushed my teeth yet.
[78.96s -> 81.96s]  I was getting out- I was getting out of the shower, and somebody just goes,
[81.96s -> 83.46s]  Hey dude, you're missing the direct.
[84.96s -> 88.46s]  I was like, I don't- I don't care.
[90.46s -> 91.96s]  But then I was like, I kind of do.
[93.46s -> 97.96s]  I haven't even brushed my teeth yet. I got up like 10 minutes ago. Did not wake up 10 minutes ago. I'm kidding.
[100.46s -> 101.96s]  All right. Get me out of here.
[110.08s -> 111.08s]  What game is this?
[114.32s -> 116.32s]  Famicom Detective Club?
[117.82s -> 118.82s]  Isn't that the Nintendo?
[120.82s -> 122.32s]  That's the Nintendo- That's the Super Nintendo.
[123.32s -> 124.82s]  I got a tweet that I'm streaming.
[128.32s -> 129.32s]  I'll turn it up.
[135.33s -> 138.33s]  Put the cam back on. Hold on a second. I wasn't ready for this.
[139.33s -> 145.03s]  Why did I rush to turn this stream on and freak out at direct?
[151.53s -> 152.53s]  Hold on.
[153.53s -> 156.03s]  Did they already announce who the next Smash Brothers character is?
[158.71s -> 160.71s]  Did they announce who the next Smash Brothers character is?
[161.21s -> 166.51s]  They did? Who was it? Johnny Bravo?
[167.01s -> 169.01s]  I really hope it was Johnny Bravo.
[172.51s -> 174.01s]  It was a Xenoblade girl.
[174.51s -> 175.51s]  Oh.
[186.50s -> 188.50s]  A new age of ba- Hold on. I gotta tweet this.
[189.50s -> 196.94s]  I'm not even paying attention. I care more about like tweeting my stream out. I'm not even- What's- Hold on.
[197.94s -> 213.04s]  I'm like screen capping this window, by the way. I didn't even get the- I didn't even get the embed link.
[213.54s -> 218.04s]  It wasn't in my froggy sleepy voice. It sounds like I just got up five minutes ago.
[218.54s -> 219.54s]  I may have.
[221.54s -> 224.04s]  Alright, I gotta tweet out. I'm ready.
[225.54s -> 231.05s]  Samurai Warriors 5.
[244.73s -> 246.23s]  I have no idea what's going on.
[248.73s -> 250.23s]  I feel like I'm dreaming.
[250.23s -> 251.23s]  I'm dreaming.
[252.73s -> 256.73s]  I'm watching Turbo 985 stream right now. I'm dreaming.
[258.23s -> 261.73s]  Am I awake? This would make sense if I woke the fuck up right now.
[262.73s -> 263.73s]  And I woke up like-
[264.23s -> 272.73s]  Sweat just dripping down my face like I've got- I've rushed to get a stream on to stream a Nintendo Direct when I've only streamed like one Nintendo Direct in four years.
[277.73s -> 279.23s]  I don't think I've ever done this.
[279.73s -> 280.90s]  Have I ever done this?
[285.40s -> 287.53s]  I- This is what I'm saying!
[290.03s -> 292.53s]  First the world's gonna explode, then I'm gonna dream.
[293.53s -> 294.53s]  Shit, I gotta shut up.
[313.18s -> 314.18s]  I have a snowman.
[315.18s -> 317.24s]  That snowman was pretty cool.
[317.74s -> 318.74s]  What game is this?
[329.82s -> 330.82s]  What do you say?
[332.82s -> 334.82s]  That looks kinda cool. Somebody said egg yolk hair.
[338.32s -> 340.82s]  When you mean there's egg yolk in my hair.
[340.82s -> 342.32s]  There's egg yolk in my hair.
[342.82s -> 345.32s]  And you know what? Here's the proof that I didn't brush my teeth.
[345.82s -> 348.32s]  Because my tongue is probably still blue from the blue drink I had last night.
[349.32s -> 349.82s]  Yup.
[350.82s -> 356.42s]  Is it?
[356.92s -> 361.41s]  I mean the screen is blue.
[361.91s -> 368.64s]  Why'd you need to prove that?
[369.14s -> 372.61s]  You don't fucking believe me.
[382.72s -> 384.22s]  Wait, is this Monster Hunter?
[385.22s -> 390.12s]  Why did they not put the Monster Hunter world on the Switch?
[392.85s -> 395.35s]  Because they were making like a Switch version kind of, I guess?
[395.85s -> 397.60s]  It's too powerful.
[399.94s -> 400.94s]  It wouldn't run.
[400.94s -> 401.94s]  Well, this one does.
[439.33s -> 441.58s]  Why the fuck are you watching this?
[442.58s -> 447.09s]  I don't know.
[447.59s -> 449.72s]  I don't know.
[450.22s -> 452.22s]  I think somebody said, dude, the direct is on.
[452.72s -> 454.72s]  I'm like, fucking, I gotta hurry the fuck up.
[455.22s -> 456.22s]  I gotta hurry up.
[460.68s -> 462.18s]  I'm watching this.
[463.85s -> 464.85s]  Go back to bed? Fine.
[475.75s -> 476.75s]  This is cool though.
[477.25s -> 478.25s]  Actually, I wanted to...
[478.75s -> 480.75s]  Recently I wanted to download Monster Hunter World.
[481.25s -> 481.75s]  On Switch.
[481.75s -> 483.25s]  But it was like, oh, it's not on Switch.
[483.25s -> 484.25s]  But okay, this is Monster Hunter Rise.
[484.25s -> 485.25s]  Cool, alright, that's cool.
[485.75s -> 486.75s]  We got a release date now.
[487.25s -> 489.25s]  Did we have a release date already and I just didn't know?
[489.25s -> 490.25s]  And I'm just...
[490.75s -> 492.75s]  Is that like a big reveal or did we already know that?
[493.25s -> 498.91s]  That was the latest trailer for Monster Hunter Rise from Capcom.
[498.91s -> 499.91s]  But it's still cool though.
[500.41s -> 504.85s]  How will our heroes fare against these ferocious monsters?
[505.35s -> 509.35s]  Stay tuned for the latest installment in the Monster Hunter series.
[509.85s -> 511.35s]  Launching March 26th.
[512.85s -> 513.53s]  Can I play it?
[513.53s -> 514.03s]  Next.
[514.53s -> 516.03s]  Please take a look at this.
[519.64s -> 521.14s]  Mario Golf, I mean, this is a huge deal.
[533.64s -> 535.14s]  Mario Golf Super Rush.
[535.14s -> 536.14s]  Okay, that's...
[536.14s -> 537.14s]  I can't wait for this game.
[542.14s -> 547.00s]  I want a new Mario Baseball too.
[548.50s -> 549.00s]  Is it multiplayer?
[549.00s -> 550.00s]  It better be.
[550.00s -> 551.00s]  I hope there is.
[552.50s -> 559.40s]  Use features on the greens like a shot gauge to see how your shot will curve due to slopes.
[559.40s -> 560.40s]  Ooh, that's cool.
[560.40s -> 563.40s]  And a scan that lets you examine a course's terrain.
[564.40s -> 565.40s]  Online multiplayer?
[565.40s -> 566.40s]  Right, it has to be.
[566.40s -> 568.40s]  These features can help you ace your shots.
[570.48s -> 577.48s]  In addition to button controls, you can also use motion controls by holding a Joy-Con controller like a golf club.
[578.48s -> 579.48s]  That's kind of cool.
[579.48s -> 581.48s]  Gently swing the controller to have your character swing in the game.
[581.48s -> 583.48s]  Dude, Wii Golf, they brought it back.
[583.48s -> 585.48s]  Enjoy the sensation of golfing.
[588.16s -> 589.16s]  You run around?
[589.16s -> 594.16s]  On top of all that, there are several modes with new elements that truly bring the heat to Mario Golf.
[594.16s -> 595.16s]  Wait, you're running around?
[595.16s -> 597.16s]  You have to fight each other?
[599.17s -> 600.17s]  Wait, what?
[600.17s -> 601.17s]  It's always your turn.
[601.17s -> 605.17s]  Everyone tees off at the same time, then you'll race through the course to reach your ball.
[606.17s -> 608.17s]  Wait, is this so unsafe?
[608.17s -> 609.17s]  Then keep going.
[609.17s -> 613.17s]  Luigi's gonna take a ball off the forehead when Mario's driving.
[613.17s -> 615.17s]  These skills aren't the only things at play.
[615.17s -> 619.17s]  Make use of dashes and special shots to beat the competition.
[620.17s -> 623.17s]  Oh, did we mention story mode?
[623.17s -> 625.17s]  There's a story mode.
[625.17s -> 631.17s]  You'll start out as a rookie and develop your golfing skills while interacting with various Mushroom Kingdom characters.
[631.17s -> 635.17s]  Okay, I hate this so much, but it might be my favorite game of the year.
[635.17s -> 637.17s]  Then allocate points to different stats.
[637.17s -> 638.17s]  You know what I mean?
[638.17s -> 639.17s]  This is amazing.
[639.17s -> 641.17s]  I hate that I love this so much.
[641.17s -> 644.17s]  You can also use your Mii in versus play.
[644.17s -> 646.17s]  You have skill points and shit in golf?
[646.17s -> 651.17s]  When Mario Golf Super Rush swings onto Nintendo Switch, June 25th.
[651.17s -> 652.17s]  I hate that sport.
[652.17s -> 655.17s]  Pre-orders begin on Nintendo eShop after this presentation.
[655.17s -> 658.17s]  I only care about golf when I play it as Super Mario, that's it.
[658.17s -> 660.17s]  But I care about it very deeply when I do.
[660.17s -> 669.17s]  The latest game in the Mario Golf series adds new gameplay for multiplayer modes, as well as the familiar golf gameplay with easy-to-learn controls.
[670.17s -> 671.17s]  This is really fun.
[671.17s -> 672.17s]  This is cool.
[672.17s -> 673.17s]  I like this.
[673.17s -> 676.92s]  You look forward to this game on Nintendo Switch.
[676.92s -> 679.92s]  Let's move on to more Nintendo Switch headlines.
[679.92s -> 680.92s]  Headlines.
[680.92s -> 682.74s]  Hey!
[682.74s -> 685.74s]  Check out these games coming to Nintendo Switch.
[685.74s -> 688.49s]  That looks good.
[688.49s -> 692.49s]  Return to the unforgiving world of Pandora in Tales from the Borderlands.
[692.49s -> 698.49s]  Play as the Hyperion lackey, Reese, and the quick-witted con artist, Fiona, as you set out to recover a mountain of cash.
[698.49s -> 699.49s]  This is not a new game.
[699.49s -> 708.49s]  But you can play it in the bathroom.
[708.49s -> 710.49s]  That's really important.
[710.49s -> 713.49s]  You can play it in the bathroom.
[713.49s -> 716.49s]  Couldn't do that before.
[716.49s -> 723.49s]  Every single game that comes on the Switch that's been out for five years, they really should just be serious about it.
[723.49s -> 724.49s]  Be real about it.
[725.49s -> 730.49s]  And Tales from the Borderlands is coming out on the Switch bathroom edition.
[730.49s -> 742.49s]  Just call it bathroom edition because that's what everyone's going to do.
[742.49s -> 747.49s]  Skyrim bathroom edition.
[747.49s -> 750.49s]  Go back offline until the Direct is over.
[754.67s -> 761.67s]  In this action game from Aspire, you'll build your zombie horde and take revenge on the city by turning humans into your undead allies.
[761.67s -> 764.67s]  Replenish your bodily arsenal with sputum head.
[764.67s -> 767.67s]  This is an incredibly highly requested game, by the way.
[767.67s -> 769.67s]  This city ain't no match for a dead man.
[769.67s -> 771.67s]  Stub the zombie and rebel without a pulse.
[771.67s -> 774.67s]  Eat its way onto Nintendo Switch March 16.
[774.67s -> 776.67s]  Pre-orders begin today on Nintendo eShop.
[776.67s -> 778.67s]  This looks pretty good.
[778.67s -> 779.67s]  All right.
[779.67s -> 780.91s]  Put that on the list.
[780.91s -> 782.91s]  That will be good.
[783.91s -> 784.91s]  Quiet.
[785.91s -> 786.91s]  Everybody quiet.
[808.91s -> 810.15s]  When is it coming out?
[813.15s -> 817.15s]  You'll have to do some odd jobs around town and earn enough to pay off the entry fee.
[817.15s -> 818.15s]  There's a mining one.
[818.15s -> 820.15s]  Against the slew of unusual opponents.
[820.15s -> 824.15s]  Most of them aliens with some crazy tricks up their sleeves.
[824.15s -> 827.15s]  Study their tactics carefully to gain the upper hand in combat.
[827.15s -> 835.15s]  With a new and improved death glove, you'll have access to a variety of deadly skills that can be customized and upgraded before each match.
[835.15s -> 837.45s]  The fate of the world is at stake.
[837.45s -> 838.45s]  Oh, man.
[838.45s -> 842.45s]  So be ready to kick some whatever aliens have that you can kick.
[842.45s -> 844.45s]  Well, it looks a little rough, though.
[848.45s -> 849.45s]  August, okay.
[849.45s -> 850.45s]  August.
[850.45s -> 851.45s]  It looks a little rough.
[852.45s -> 855.55s]  They all do.
[855.55s -> 856.55s]  Yeah, they do.
[858.55s -> 859.55s]  I'm going to play it.
[859.55s -> 860.55s]  I'm going to love it.
[860.55s -> 862.55s]  But that looked like really brain-brainy and kind of rough.
[872.57s -> 873.57s]  It's your PC.
[874.57s -> 877.60s]  Wait, is this a card game?
[877.60s -> 878.60s]  It's a shooter?
[879.60s -> 894.27s]  What?
[899.83s -> 908.08s]  I'm absolutely not going to play this, but it looks like a great game to watch somebody play, play very well.
[910.15s -> 911.15s]  Looking forward to that.
[926.48s -> 928.68s]  Cool.
[928.68s -> 931.68s]  The DC Super Hero Girls are here to save the day.
[932.68s -> 933.68s]  Hi, everyone.
[933.68s -> 934.68s]  My name is Barbara Gordon.
[935.68s -> 939.24s]  DC Super Hero Girls Teen Power.
[939.24s -> 940.60s]  He's inventing new gadgets.
[940.60s -> 945.36s]  This is Super Girl.
[945.36s -> 948.36s]  She's super strong and has heat vision.
[948.36s -> 949.36s]  Plus super breath.
[949.36s -> 951.37s]  Super breath.
[951.37s -> 952.37s]  And let's not forget Wonder Woman.
[952.37s -> 954.37s]  And, of course, Super Breath.
[954.37s -> 959.64s]  You don't want to be, you don't want your move to be classified as super breath.
[959.64s -> 962.64s]  Along with our friends Green Lantern, Bumblebee, and Zatanna, we fight evil supervillains to keep our city.
[962.64s -> 963.64s]  I feel like that's kind of rude.
[963.64s -> 964.64s]  But we're not justified.
[964.64s -> 966.64s]  Like, wow, you got super breath today.
[966.64s -> 967.64s]  Like, okay.
[969.64s -> 970.64s]  There'll be clean breath?
[971.64s -> 972.64s]  How about like minty breath?
[982.81s -> 983.99s]  She used her new super move.
[983.99s -> 984.99s]  Clean breath.
[986.99s -> 987.99s]  Hey, that sucked.
[987.99s -> 988.99s]  That's a shitty superpower.
[990.48s -> 991.48s]  You brushed your teeth this morning?
[992.48s -> 993.48s]  Yeah, but it's a ton.
[993.48s -> 994.48s]  It's a huge air.
[995.98s -> 996.98s]  Clean breath.
[1000.48s -> 1002.48s]  ...figures out our secret identities.
[1002.48s -> 1005.55s]  DC Super Hero Girls.
[1005.55s -> 1006.55s]  Teen Power.
[1006.55s -> 1008.55s]  Heroically sourced onto Nintendo Switch.
[1008.55s -> 1009.55s]  June 4th.
[1013.48s -> 1015.48s]  Ready the juice cannons and prepare for battle.
[1015.48s -> 1016.48s]  Are we?
[1018.91s -> 1024.03s]  This is what Plants vs. Zombies.
[1024.03s -> 1033.18s]  Battle for Neighborville.
[1035.38s -> 1036.38s]  March 25th Switch.
[1037.38s -> 1040.22s]  Fleet Edition.
[1044.72s -> 1048.37s]  Is this just Plants vs. Warfare?
[1050.96s -> 1051.96s]  Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.
[1052.96s -> 1059.25s]  Yeah, it is.
[1059.25s -> 1065.23s]  Okay.
[1065.23s -> 1066.85s]  Everybody get up.
[1066.85s -> 1067.85s]  Everybody get up.
[1067.85s -> 1068.85s]  Everybody just stand up.
[1068.85s -> 1069.85s]  Put your hands up.
[1079.48s -> 1080.48s]  Everybody just get up.
[1081.48s -> 1082.48s]  Just get up.
[1082.48s -> 1083.48s]  Get up already.
[1083.48s -> 1084.48s]  Come on.
[1084.48s -> 1085.48s]  Get up.
[1085.48s -> 1087.29s]  Get up.
[1087.29s -> 1088.29s]  No, sit down.
[1088.29s -> 1089.29s]  You're playing a video game.
[1089.29s -> 1090.29s]  It's Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.
[1090.29s -> 1091.29s]  Sit the fuck down.
[1092.29s -> 1094.29s]  You're gonna get in the way of everybody else on the couch.
[1094.29s -> 1095.29s]  Don't stand up.
[1095.29s -> 1096.29s]  Sit down.
[1096.29s -> 1097.29s]  Stay seated.
[1104.29s -> 1105.29s]  It's Miitopia.
[1121.74s -> 1122.74s]  Makeup.
[1124.74s -> 1125.74s]  I feel like I have to play this.
[1131.74s -> 1132.74s]  What do they do?
[1132.74s -> 1133.74s]  Do they just live in like a house or something?
[1133.74s -> 1134.74s]  They live in like a town?
[1136.74s -> 1137.74s]  Ooh.
[1137.74s -> 1138.74s]  This is cute.
[1138.74s -> 1139.74s]  This is cute.
[1146.24s -> 1147.24s]  Oh, cool.
[1171.86s -> 1172.86s]  Miitopia.
[1178.86s -> 1181.10s]  Yeah, I turned on the facecam for the raid.
[1181.10s -> 1184.00s]  I saw it.
[1187.00s -> 1190.00s]  I saw Kitboga just came in with a fucking monster raid.
[1190.00s -> 1192.00s]  So I turned on the webcam.
[1194.00s -> 1195.00s]  Thanks a lot.
[1195.00s -> 1196.00s]  Welcome, guys.
[1196.00s -> 1197.00s]  We're watching the Directive.
[1197.00s -> 1198.00s]  We're gonna play Slime Rancher later.
[1198.00s -> 1199.00s]  That's Super Mario.
[1202.00s -> 1203.00s]  Wait, what?
[1204.00s -> 1207.00s]  So play some however and wherever you'd like.
[1207.00s -> 1208.00s]  That's awesome.
[1208.00s -> 1209.00s]  Whoa.
[1209.00s -> 1212.00s]  It's Mario Maker Animal Crossing.
[1212.00s -> 1215.80s]  But thanks a lot, Kitboga.
[1215.80s -> 1216.80s]  Welcome, everybody.
[1216.80s -> 1217.80s]  Thank you.
[1217.80s -> 1218.80s]  That's a shitload of people.
[1218.80s -> 1220.80s]  Hope you had a good stream.
[1220.80s -> 1222.36s]  Have a good rest of your day, dude.
[1222.36s -> 1225.36s]  Hey, why not try recreating the Mushroom Kingdom?
[1225.36s -> 1229.61s]  The raid song?
[1229.61s -> 1231.61s]  A free update for the game launches February 25th.
[1231.61s -> 1238.49s]  After downloading it, Super Mario Bros. items will be available via Nook Shopping starting March 1st.
[1239.49s -> 1242.49s]  I was off camera, but I was going like this.
[1242.49s -> 1245.49s]  Trying to find a way to do it.
[1245.49s -> 1246.49s]  I was going like this.
[1252.06s -> 1253.06s]  I was getting ready.
[1253.06s -> 1254.06s]  I was getting ready to be like...
[1255.06s -> 1258.09s]  There you go.
[1258.09s -> 1259.09s]  This is your raid song.
[1259.09s -> 1260.09s]  Welcome.
[1260.09s -> 1261.09s]  Thanks for the raid.
[1261.09s -> 1262.09s]  Thanks.
[1266.09s -> 1267.09s]  Go follow Kitboga if you don't.
[1267.09s -> 1268.09s]  What are you, out of your mind?
[1274.52s -> 1279.52s]  A new launch for the Super Mario 3D World plus Bowser's Fury game.
[1279.52s -> 1283.52s]  We hope you enjoy that Mario adventure as well.
[1283.52s -> 1288.47s]  Next, we have another game to show you.
[1288.47s -> 1290.22s]  Another one.
[1290.22s -> 1292.74s]  What's this one?
[1292.74s -> 1293.74s]  Zelda.
[1293.74s -> 1294.74s]  The Legend of Zelda.
[1294.74s -> 1297.04s]  Tipping the scales.
[1297.04s -> 1301.23s]  Legend of Zelda.
[1301.23s -> 1309.10s]  The weight of time.
[1309.10s -> 1312.10s]  What ideas will you expose?
[1312.10s -> 1315.00s]  What is that?
[1315.00s -> 1317.00s]  The latest in the HD 2D series.
[1317.00s -> 1321.36s]  He leaves us no recourse.
[1321.36s -> 1322.36s]  Oh.
[1322.36s -> 1324.36s]  S-Frost will answer for its crimes today.
[1324.36s -> 1327.36s]  Are these the wages of loyalty?
[1327.36s -> 1330.36s]  Raised earth and burnt corpses.
[1330.36s -> 1334.36s]  You and no other must decide how we proceed.
[1334.36s -> 1336.36s]  I would love like a Christmas, like Santa RPG.
[1336.36s -> 1338.36s]  It's like top down, like isometric Santa Claus.
[1338.36s -> 1340.36s]  You like play Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus.
[1340.36s -> 1343.36s]  Like Rudolph and Frosty and shit.
[1343.36s -> 1344.36s]  What is that?
[1344.36s -> 1345.36s]  Why make that?
[1345.36s -> 1347.36s]  It'd be cool.
[1347.36s -> 1350.36s]  I promise to do all in my power to see us through this safely.
[1350.36s -> 1353.36s]  Every last one of us.
[1353.36s -> 1357.12s]  Triangle strategy?
[1357.12s -> 1361.68s]  Far, far away lies the continent of Norzilea.
[1361.68s -> 1365.68s]  Comprised of three nations and limited deposits of salt and iron.
[1365.68s -> 1370.68s]  The constant feuds among the nations over these precious resources
[1370.68s -> 1376.68s]  eventually ignited into a great conflict known as the Salt-Iron War.
[1376.68s -> 1379.68s]  Though the hostilities ceased with an uneasy truce,
[1379.68s -> 1383.68s]  decades later the flames of war threatened to engulf the realm once again.
[1383.68s -> 1384.68s]  Can I ask a question?
[1384.68s -> 1387.68s]  What's with the burning embers that go across the screen on every trailer ever?
[1387.68s -> 1390.68s]  Caught in a tangled fiery web of plots and conspiracies.
[1390.68s -> 1393.68s]  It's always like the edges are burning and embers are floating across the screen.
[1393.68s -> 1395.68s]  In like half of every trailer I've ever watched.
[1395.68s -> 1397.68s]  That would orchestrate their downfall.
[1397.68s -> 1399.68s]  Our benefit you say.
[1399.68s -> 1401.68s]  Just pay attention, you'll see.
[1401.68s -> 1407.96s]  In this new tactical RPG, battles take place on terrain
[1407.96s -> 1409.96s]  with different elevations.
[1409.96s -> 1414.96s]  A character's attack range is determined by their location and their equipment.
[1414.96s -> 1418.96s]  The range can be extended by attacking from higher ground
[1418.96s -> 1421.96s]  with long-range weapons such as bows and arrows.
[1421.96s -> 1424.96s]  Thus, your forces can use the terrain and other elements
[1424.96s -> 1427.96s]  to gain the upper hand.
[1427.96s -> 1431.96s]  An enemy outflanked is susceptible not only to your angel attack,
[1431.96s -> 1436.96s]  but also a powerful blow from the ally positioned behind the enemy.
[1436.96s -> 1438.96s]  What have we here?
[1438.96s -> 1445.68s]  Charge into an enemy to see them flying into position for a follow-up attack.
[1445.68s -> 1453.68s]  Link attacks together by first casting ice magic on the flames to create water terrain.
[1453.68s -> 1458.68s]  Then, electrify the area with lightning magic.
[1458.68s -> 1460.68s]  Power up!
[1460.68s -> 1464.68s]  It is of the utmost importance to survey the battlefield.
[1464.68s -> 1473.08s]  Electrify the battlefield with power up!
[1473.08s -> 1477.08s]  Throughout the story, you will be faced with making important decisions
[1477.08s -> 1482.51s]  in a variety of situations.
[1482.51s -> 1486.51s]  Utility, morality, liberty.
[1486.51s -> 1490.51s]  Collectively, your decisions will establish your conviction
[1490.51s -> 1495.51s]  affecting how the story unfolds and who will join your cause.
[1495.51s -> 1498.88s]  Once more, I would ask you plainly.
[1498.88s -> 1502.88s]  Do we or don't we relinquish Prince Roland to Azeroth?
[1502.88s -> 1506.88s]  Critical decisions that may determine the fates of nations
[1506.88s -> 1509.88s]  are settled by vote on the scales of conviction.
[1509.88s -> 1515.88s]  Use information you've gathered to sway allies toward your favored cause.
[1515.88s -> 1521.88s]  The story will significantly change based on how the votes are cast.
[1521.88s -> 1524.88s]  So they refuse to relinquish him to us.
[1524.88s -> 1527.88s]  Lies! His hand was forced!
[1527.88s -> 1530.88s]  Once more and more critical decisions are made,
[1530.88s -> 1535.88s]  your journey may take you down paths divergent from those of other players.
[1535.88s -> 1541.14s]  You will see what true might is!
[1541.14s -> 1546.14s]  Project Triangle Strategy, a brand new tactical RPG.
[1546.14s -> 1550.14s]  I'm sorry, ever since Peter Molyneux told me that like,
[1550.14s -> 1553.14s]  they're fabled too.
[1553.14s -> 1557.14s]  I remember he talked about trees and shit and how the world was going to change.
[1557.14s -> 1559.14s]  I don't trust anybody anymore.
[1559.14s -> 1565.14s]  That tree that you plant there will turn in a hundred years into an ice cream truck.
[1565.14s -> 1567.14s]  I was like, holy shit, how the fuck's that going to happen, Peter Molyneux?
[1567.14s -> 1570.14s]  What are you talking about? That sounds insane.
[1570.14s -> 1578.02s]  And that tree's roots will go into the ground and create ten cities of ants and mice.
[1578.02s -> 1582.02s]  Like, okay, cool.
[1582.02s -> 1585.02s]  And I think the biggest decision in that game is like, you have a dog.
[1585.02s -> 1588.02s]  A dog? What kind of dog do you want?
[1588.02s -> 1595.08s]  There's like two different, three different kinds.
[1595.08s -> 1613.71s]  Oh shit, quiet.
[1613.71s -> 1616.71s]  Oh, I spelled Pog.
[1616.71s -> 1618.71s]  I was...
[1621.71s -> 1624.71s]  He's just winding the toy up, ready to like, Pog!
[1624.71s -> 1626.71s]  Pop up and Pog.
[1626.71s -> 1628.71s]  I didn't get a chance.
[1636.27s -> 1638.27s]  Gorgon love battle.
[1638.27s -> 1640.27s]  Gorgon use many weapons.
[1640.27s -> 1643.27s]  Triple-bladed war axe, spear of misery,
[1643.27s -> 1646.27s]  Hades soul-devouring crossbow.
[1646.27s -> 1648.27s]  A princess is supposed to lead her people,
[1648.27s -> 1651.27s]  not be stuck up in some tower waiting for a hero.
[1651.27s -> 1654.27s]  In my line of work, bullets are constantly whizzing past you.
[1654.27s -> 1657.27s]  Flaming longsword, blade of doom.
[1657.27s -> 1660.27s]  Just once, just once, I'd like to catch one of your bones.
[1660.27s -> 1661.27s]  Are these all Fortnite skins?
[1661.27s -> 1664.27s]  I don't know, the background's messing me up.
[1665.27s -> 1670.94s]  Look, it's simple.
[1670.94s -> 1672.94s]  Gorgon want new weapon.
[1672.94s -> 1674.94s]  In Knockout City, I'm like a kung-fu master.
[1674.94s -> 1676.94s]  I can catch bullets.
[1683.08s -> 1686.92s]  That's cool.
[1686.92s -> 1688.92s]  Alright, hold on.
[1688.92s -> 1690.92s]  Is this dodgeball?
[1690.92s -> 1693.92s]  Let's find out what sound your face makes.
[1693.92s -> 1697.19s]  Is this dodgeball? No, it's not.
[1697.19s -> 1698.19s]  No.
[1698.19s -> 1711.37s]  You can throw people.
[1711.37s -> 1720.64s]  We're losing to a bunch of farmers.
[1720.64s -> 1721.64s]  Okay, team.
[1721.64s -> 1724.64s]  They may have won the battle, but not the war.
[1724.64s -> 1726.64s]  Why is the switch so small?
[1726.64s -> 1727.64s]  Why are the switches so t-
[1727.64s -> 1728.64s]  Oh, no, no, no, they're controllers.
[1728.64s -> 1731.64s]  I was like, why do they have tiny, like, iPhone switches?
[1731.64s -> 1734.64s]  Because the other people had the switches in their hands looking down.
[1734.64s -> 1738.00s]  We went up to- there was no TV, we were told of.
[1739.00s -> 1742.18s]  The big- the big orc guy had it in his hands looking down.
[1742.18s -> 1744.18s]  But there was no television they're looking at.
[1744.18s -> 1746.55s]  This is cameras.
[1746.55s -> 1749.55s]  No, I- I'm telling you, like, two people had the thing looking down at it.
[1752.90s -> 1754.90s]  The fight for survival starts now.
[1754.90s -> 1757.46s]  Hang on tight.
[1757.46s -> 1761.46s]  Because you're all going to play a little game of fate for me.
[1761.46s -> 1762.46s]  They're not real.
[1762.46s -> 1766.46s]  From the creators of the Danganronpa and Zero Escape series comes the fight for your life.
[1766.46s -> 1769.46s]  Literally, disoriented and trapped in an underwater theme park,
[1769.46s -> 1772.46s]  the twelve of you, known as the Go-Getters Club,
[1772.46s -> 1775.46s]  must now survive this game of fate at all costs.
[1775.46s -> 1777.46s]  I don't want to die yet!
[1777.46s -> 1780.96s]  Sorry to scare you all, but-
[1780.96s -> 1782.96s]  You are going to play this game.
[1783.96s -> 1784.96s]  I'm not going to play this game.
[1786.96s -> 1788.96s]  Well, no one's going to play it, I guess.
[1791.96s -> 1792.96s]  They got a call?
[1793.96s -> 1796.96s]  Hey, uh, cut the direct off right here.
[1796.96s -> 1797.96s]  This thing's not coming out.
[1812.32s -> 1815.32s]  I feel like that would be really hard to do that.
[1816.32s -> 1820.32s]  All it takes is one person to fuck that up, the rhythm, and the whole fight goes down.
[1822.32s -> 1823.32s]  Ooh, this is a good game.
[1824.32s -> 1825.32s]  Physical release?
[1833.32s -> 1834.32s]  Oh, cool.
[1842.32s -> 1844.32s]  I thought I was going to say, I hate his original game.
[1845.32s -> 1846.32s]  Wait, what?
[1847.32s -> 1849.32s]  He played the Switch one.
[1849.32s -> 1851.32s]  And it comes with a PC code.
[1851.32s -> 1853.32s]  So, you don't have to play it on Switch.
[1857.32s -> 1858.32s]  That would be so funny.
[1864.32s -> 1865.32s]  What a great game.
[1871.32s -> 1872.32s]  Ninja Gaiden?
[1877.32s -> 1878.32s]  The four Dark Souls.
[1880.32s -> 1881.32s]  This was the Dark Souls.
[1884.48s -> 1885.48s]  This was like the hard game, right?
[1885.48s -> 1887.48s]  This was like the hardest game.
[1887.48s -> 1890.30s]  This was like the old Dark Souls, right?
[1891.30s -> 1892.30s]  Does this still hold up?
[1893.30s -> 1894.30s]  I don't think so.
[1895.30s -> 1896.30s]  I don't think so.
[1897.30s -> 1898.30s]  I don't think so.
[1899.30s -> 1900.30s]  I don't think so.
[1901.30s -> 1902.30s]  I don't think so.
[1903.30s -> 1904.30s]  Does this still hold up?
[1911.30s -> 1912.30s]  It does.
[1917.30s -> 1918.30s]  Ninja Gaiden is fucking hard.
[1918.30s -> 1919.30s]  Yeah.
[1926.54s -> 1927.54s]  Some of them are shit.
[1928.54s -> 1929.54s]  What's a good one?
[1932.54s -> 1934.54s]  This is harder than Dark Souls, yeah.
[1940.54s -> 1942.54s]  What does this say on the difficulty tier list?
[1944.54s -> 1945.54s]  Oh, a better question.
[1945.54s -> 1947.54s]  Where's Dark Souls on that tier list?
[1947.54s -> 1948.54s]  Is Dark Souls A?
[1948.54s -> 1949.54s]  B?
[1951.54s -> 1952.54s]  Ninja Gaiden is S tier?
[1952.54s -> 1954.54s]  Is it like one of the hardest series ever?
[1957.54s -> 1961.08s]  Dark Souls is like B+.
[1962.08s -> 1972.35s]  EOTW sucks.
[1974.35s -> 1975.35s]  I didn't say it.
[1975.35s -> 1976.35s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[1976.35s -> 1977.35s]  I never played it.
[1977.35s -> 1985.37s]  Zelda sucks.
[1987.83s -> 1988.83s]  No, it doesn't.
[1988.83s -> 1992.63s]  Okay, can I...
[1992.63s -> 1993.63s]  I have...
[1993.63s -> 1994.80s]  This is important.
[1994.80s -> 1995.80s]  Do I get...
[1995.80s -> 2000.80s]  Do I get to have an opinion on like the current Zelda games if I have not played one since...
[2001.80s -> 2004.80s]  I gave up two hours into Twilight Princess?
[2004.80s -> 2005.80s]  Okay.
[2017.80s -> 2024.80s]  Yeah, I got to the part of Twilight Princess where I went in a chlorine filled pool and
[2024.80s -> 2028.80s]  then got out of the pool and opened my eyes and turned my head and looked at lights.
[2029.80s -> 2030.80s]  I got to that part.
[2034.80s -> 2049.75s]  Yeah, I got to the point of Twilight Princess where you had fucking chlorine eyes and I
[2049.75s -> 2050.75s]  stopped playing.
[2065.75s -> 2068.56s]  He got scared.
[2080.74s -> 2081.74s]  I don't remember any of these.
[2081.74s -> 2082.74s]  Remastered?
[2082.74s -> 2084.74s]  I don't remember any of this.
[2084.74s -> 2096.74s]  Were these games that came out like a decade ago or something?
[2096.74s -> 2097.74s]  Two decades ago?
[2107.74s -> 2108.74s]  It was in the Dreamcast.
[2108.74s -> 2109.74s]  Oh, okay.
[2115.74s -> 2116.74s]  Dinosaur?
[2129.75s -> 2130.75s]  Going good.
[2135.75s -> 2136.75s]  Super Mario Galaxy 3.
[2139.75s -> 2140.75s]  Super Mario Galaxy 3.
[2141.75s -> 2142.75s]  Coming up.
[2147.84s -> 2149.84s]  I'm the producer of the Legend of Zelda series.
[2150.84s -> 2153.84s]  I'm sure a lot of you saw me and thought there might be news about the sequel to the Legend
[2153.84s -> 2155.84s]  of Zelda Breath of the Wild game.
[2156.84s -> 2158.84s]  Unfortunately, we don't have anything to share right now.
[2159.84s -> 2160.84s]  We apologize.
[2161.84s -> 2165.84s]  Development is proceeding smoothly and we should be able to bring you some new information
[2165.84s -> 2166.84s]  this year.
[2167.84s -> 2170.84s]  For now, we'll have to ask you to wait just a bit longer.
[2171.84s -> 2172.84s]  Just kidding.
[2172.84s -> 2173.84s]  Here's the trailer.
[2173.84s -> 2176.84s]  While you're all waiting, however, this Legend of Zelda game will be coming to Nintendo Switch.
[2177.84s -> 2178.84s]  Please take a look.
[2231.37s -> 2235.37s]  What you've just seen is the Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword HD.
[2237.06s -> 2242.06s]  This game originally released in 2011 on the Wii console and now it's coming to Nintendo Switch.
[2243.88s -> 2247.88s]  The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword featured a control scheme in which players would use
[2247.88s -> 2251.88s]  the Wii Remote Plus controller as a sword and the Nunchuk controller as a shield.
[2252.88s -> 2255.88s]  With the increased processing power of the Nintendo Switch system, the controls here
[2255.88s -> 2257.88s]  are smoother and even more intuitive.
[2257.88s -> 2262.18s]  And we've recreated the controls for the sword and the shield here by having the player
[2262.18s -> 2264.18s]  hold two Joy-Con controllers.
[2265.18s -> 2266.18s]  Oh, it's motion control.
[2266.18s -> 2267.18s]  Okay.
[2267.18s -> 2268.18s]  Nevermind.
[2268.18s -> 2269.18s]  I hate it.
[2269.18s -> 2272.18s]  Swing it to have Link swing his sword in the game.
[2273.18s -> 2276.61s]  The Joy-Con controller in your left hand is the shield.
[2276.61s -> 2279.61s]  You know how many times I'm going to be like, I'm getting the fucking sensor bar.
[2279.61s -> 2280.61s]  The sensor's not working.
[2280.61s -> 2281.61s]  I can't see anything.
[2281.61s -> 2282.61s]  This is stupid.
[2282.61s -> 2283.61s]  It doesn't work.
[2283.61s -> 2284.61s]  Look at the screen.
[2284.61s -> 2285.61s]  It's glitching.
[2285.61s -> 2286.61s]  It'll be half the picture.
[2286.61s -> 2290.61s]  These physical movements add a sense of urgency and tension to combat.
[2291.61s -> 2295.61s]  But we've also made it possible to play the game with button controls to ensure it can
[2295.61s -> 2299.61s]  be played in handheld mode or on the Nintendo Switch Lite system.
[2299.61s -> 2303.61s]  After mulling over how to assign different gameplay elements to different buttons, we
[2303.61s -> 2307.61s]  decided to apply the sword motions to tilting the right control stick.
[2307.61s -> 2308.61s]  What?
[2310.81s -> 2311.81s]  But how do you...
[2311.81s -> 2315.05s]  Tilt the stick down when you want to swing the sword downward.
[2316.05s -> 2317.05s]  Oh shit.
[2317.05s -> 2324.05s]  Swing to the right, to the left, or diagonally, just tilt the stick in the respective direction.
[2325.05s -> 2327.05s]  This looks actually, that looks pretty good.
[2327.05s -> 2329.68s]  Saved, saved, saved.
[2329.68s -> 2331.68s]  Here's something else we've been working on.
[2331.68s -> 2333.68s]  Specially designed Joy-Con controllers.
[2333.68s -> 2337.68s]  The right Joy-Con controller is themed after the Master Sword while the left features a
[2337.68s -> 2339.68s]  Hylian shield motif.
[2339.68s -> 2343.68s]  The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword as the game depicting the earliest story in the Legend
[2343.68s -> 2347.68s]  of Zelda timeline details the events around the creation of the Master Sword itself.
[2347.68s -> 2352.82s]  We hope that people who played the original game on Wii and those playing it for the first
[2352.82s -> 2355.82s]  time will enjoy discovering the origins of the Legend of Zelda.
[2355.82s -> 2357.82s]  Joy-Con Drift.
[2357.82s -> 2359.83s]  Isn't that problem?
[2359.83s -> 2364.26s]  The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword HD launches July 16th.
[2364.26s -> 2370.20s]  Following this Nintendo Direct, you'll be able to pre-order the game on Nintendo eShop.
[2370.20s -> 2374.20s]  And the specially designed Joy-Con controllers will launch on the game's release day at your
[2374.20s -> 2375.20s]  local retailers.
[2375.20s -> 2379.20s]  Many of you may already know this, but the Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword was the last
[2380.20s -> 2384.20s]  original console game prior to the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild game.
[2384.20s -> 2387.20s]  And it was still following the established conventions of the Legend of Zelda.
[2387.20s -> 2392.20s]  However, it gave a glimpse into many features and innovations that would eventually be adopted
[2392.20s -> 2394.20s]  in the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
[2394.20s -> 2396.20s]  Using the sail cloth to descend in midair.
[2396.20s -> 2397.20s]  Oh, that looks fun.
[2397.20s -> 2399.20s]  A stamina gauge that depleted as you scaled walls.
[2399.20s -> 2401.20s]  Would I like Breath of the Wild?
[2401.20s -> 2403.20s]  Would I? Don't bullshit me here.
[2403.20s -> 2404.20s]  Give me the real story.
[2404.20s -> 2406.20s]  Would I really like this game?
[2406.20s -> 2407.20s]  I don't play Legend of Zelda.
[2407.20s -> 2408.20s]  I'm not a big fan of it.
[2408.20s -> 2409.20s]  I respect it as a series.
[2409.20s -> 2411.20s]  I think it's great for everything.
[2411.20s -> 2413.20s]  Without Legend of Zelda, we would have nothing.
[2413.20s -> 2414.20s]  We would have nothing.
[2414.20s -> 2417.20s]  It is the Dungeons and Dragons of modern adventure games.
[2417.20s -> 2418.20s]  I understand that.
[2418.20s -> 2420.20s]  Please look forward to the Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword HD.
[2420.20s -> 2422.20s]  Would I like Breath of the Wild?
[2422.20s -> 2427.13s]  Well, what did you think?
[2427.13s -> 2432.13s]  The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword has been optimized for Nintendo Switch.
[2432.13s -> 2437.13s]  It includes intuitive motion controls and button controls by tilting the right control stand.
[2437.13s -> 2439.13s]  How long do I cook bacon in an air fryer?
[2439.13s -> 2442.13s]  Okay, the next game will be our last announcement for today.
[2442.13s -> 2443.13s]  Epic.
[2443.13s -> 2444.13s]  Please take a look at this.
[2444.13s -> 2447.13s]  I don't know, but that was epic what you said.
[2447.13s -> 2448.13s]  I don't know why.
[2448.13s -> 2449.13s]  Something in that sentence.
[2449.13s -> 2453.32s]  I don't know.
[2453.32s -> 2454.32s]  Put bacon in an air fryer?
[2454.32s -> 2456.32s]  Cook it in like the fucking pan or the oven.
[2456.32s -> 2458.07s]  Be careful.
[2458.07s -> 2463.40s]  Is this...
[2463.40s -> 2464.96s]  Oh, shit.
[2464.96s -> 2476.28s]  Is this Splatoon 3 or is this like Splatoon RPG game?
[2476.28s -> 2484.35s]  Fallout Splatoon.
[2491.92s -> 2492.92s]  Here it comes.
[2492.92s -> 2500.09s]  It's like, what the hell is this?
[2500.09s -> 2523.07s]  Splatoon Rust.
[2523.07s -> 2563.37s]  What the hell is this game?
[2563.37s -> 2564.37s]  It's gonna be a skateboard.
[2564.37s -> 2567.15s]  Skateboard.
[2568.90s -> 2569.90s]  Splatoon...
[2569.90s -> 2570.90s]  It's Splatoon 3.
[2570.90s -> 2587.95s]  Oh.
[2587.95s -> 2588.95s]  Where are we dropping?
[2597.46s -> 2606.23s]  Come on, give me that one.
[2606.23s -> 2608.40s]  Of course you're gonna drop right there.
[2608.40s -> 2610.40s]  It's two teams on either side.
[2610.40s -> 2612.40s]  Come on, that's the comedy.
[2612.40s -> 2614.40s]  That's the humor in that one I just said.
[2614.40s -> 2617.60s]  What the fuck?
[2617.60s -> 2619.55s]  2022.
[2619.55s -> 2624.56s]  Hold on.
[2624.56s -> 2634.58s]  What you've just seen is the latest installment in the Splatoon series, Splatoon 3.
[2634.58s -> 2639.58s]  This game is scheduled to launch in 2022, so it'll be a while.
[2639.58s -> 2645.78s]  We hope you'll stay tuned for more information at a later time.
[2645.78s -> 2646.78s]  I didn't really play it.
[2646.78s -> 2650.78s]  Today, we showed you a sampling of games coming to Nintendo Switch.
[2650.78s -> 2654.60s]  A variety of games are in development.
[2654.60s -> 2657.60s]  And we look forward to sharing more news with you in the future.
[2657.60s -> 2659.60s]  That's all for today's Nintendo Direct.
[2659.60s -> 2660.60s]  That's not...
[2660.60s -> 2661.60s]  Thank you for watching.
[2661.60s -> 2663.09s]  No, it's not.
[2663.09s -> 2666.38s]  It's not over.
[2666.38s -> 2687.55s]  Well, that was the Nintendo Direct.
[2687.55s -> 2689.55s]  So, let me give you my thoughts.
[2689.55s -> 2693.00s]  What do we see?
[2693.00s -> 2695.08s]  What do we see?
[2695.08s -> 2699.83s]  We saw Super Mario Animal Crossing skins.
[2699.83s -> 2701.07s]  Kind of cool.
[2701.07s -> 2702.63s]  We saw...
[2702.63s -> 2704.51s]  What's wrong?
[2704.51s -> 2705.51s]  What are you doing?
[2705.51s -> 2706.81s]  No, I have...
[2706.81s -> 2707.81s]  It's my five o'clock shadow.
[2707.81s -> 2709.81s]  That's a five o'clock shadow.
[2709.81s -> 2710.81s]  Are you talking about up here?
[2710.81s -> 2711.81s]  Okay.
[2711.81s -> 2715.27s]  Well, I banned that person for three days.
[2715.27s -> 2716.27s]  It's like a beard.
[2716.27s -> 2719.75s]  You missed Team Fortress 3.
[2719.75s -> 2724.44s]  What did we saw?
[2724.44s -> 2725.44s]  We saw...
[2725.44s -> 2729.69s]  Why did I even turn the stream on for this?
[2729.69s -> 2732.89s]  One person told me to turn this on.
[2732.89s -> 2734.89s]  Somebody was like, dude, you're missing the Direct.
[2734.89s -> 2736.89s]  The fucking Nintendo Direct.
[2736.89s -> 2739.20s]  And I'm like, fuck, I got to get on there.
[2739.20s -> 2742.14s]  Why did I even stream that?
[2742.14s -> 2744.57s]  I mean, there was a couple of cool things.
[2744.57s -> 2745.57s]  What did I see?
[2745.57s -> 2752.23s]  Oh, Travis Touchdown.
[2752.23s -> 2753.23s]  No More Heroes 3.
[2753.23s -> 2755.92s]  It looked like it was going to be fun.
[2755.92s -> 2757.35s]  We got a release date, too.
[2757.35s -> 2758.35s]  August.
[2758.35s -> 2759.35s]  Kind of far away.
[2759.35s -> 2761.36s]  Mario Golf, that's right.
[2761.36s -> 2762.36s]  Mario Golf.
[2762.36s -> 2763.36s]  That's right.
[2763.36s -> 2764.36s]  Mario Golf.
[2764.36s -> 2765.72s]  That's a PogChamp moment.
[2765.72s -> 2773.11s]  What else was there?
[2773.11s -> 2774.11s]  Ninja Gaiden.
[2774.11s -> 2777.01s]  All right.
[2777.01s -> 2781.07s]  Yeah.
[2781.07s -> 2782.07s]  No, that's true.
[2782.07s -> 2785.44s]  I mean, I could have rolled over in bed and opened Twitter and seen the first somebody
[2785.44s -> 2787.44s]  going, hey, there's a new Mario Golf.
[2787.44s -> 2788.44s]  That's so cool.
[2788.44s -> 2794.50s]  And I would just be like, yeah, that's pretty cool.
[2794.50s -> 2798.15s]  And I would just go back to bed.
[2798.15s -> 2799.15s]  That's like a rollover.
[2799.15s -> 2801.15s]  Like, that's a good surprise on Twitter this morning.
[2801.15s -> 2802.84s]  All right.
[2802.84s -> 2806.48s]  I'm going back to bed.
[2806.48s -> 2807.48s]  One Voice Andy.
[2807.48s -> 2808.48s]  What do you mean, One Voice Andy?
[2808.48s -> 2809.48s]  What are you talking about?
[2809.48s -> 2810.48s]  This is me.
[2810.48s -> 2811.48s]  What do you mean, One Voice Andy?
[2811.48s -> 2812.48s]  One Voice Andy.
[2812.48s -> 2813.48s]  You're a liar.
[2813.48s -> 2814.48s]  You made that up.
[2814.48s -> 2815.48s]  You have to lie.
[2815.48s -> 2817.36s]  All right.
[2817.36s -> 2818.73s]  Well, now we're going to play a game.
[2818.73s -> 2823.87s]  I'm going to get off the camera here because why would I need to be on camera anymore?
[2823.87s -> 2824.87s]  I'm going to play...
[2824.87s -> 2828.48s]  What the heck are we doing?
[2828.48s -> 2829.91s]  Slime Rancher.
[2829.91s -> 2830.91s]  That's right.
[2830.91s -> 2834.26s]  I'm going to play Slime Rancher.
[2834.26s -> 2835.26s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[2835.26s -> 2837.46s]  Let me get...
[2837.46s -> 2838.46s]  Just let me get BRB for one second.
[2838.46s -> 2843.71s]  I'm going to brush my teeth.
[2843.71s -> 2844.71s]  Get back on camera.
[2844.71s -> 2845.71s]  Hold on.
[2845.71s -> 2846.71s]  I need to like change the Switch stuff.
[2846.71s -> 2847.71s]  I'll be right back.
[2847.71s -> 2848.71s]  Just watch Look at the Mart for a second.
[2848.71s -> 2849.71s]  I'll be right back.
