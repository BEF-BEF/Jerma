[1.53s -> 19.59s]  Wait, hold on. I didn't clear my throat before turning on the microphone. So that's my fault.
[20.63s -> 26.95s]  Hi guys. Why was everybody striking? I said, hey, we're on strike. We're on strike.
[27.91s -> 40.62s]  We're on strike. We're on strike. We're on strike. Why? What? What happened? What did I do? We already
[40.62s -> 52.66s]  forgot why. Look, I already know. I already know about the blank space thing. I was on my phone
[54.17s -> 58.65s]  checking in 20 minutes ago or so. And I just see a bunch of blank spaces, blank spaces,
[58.65s -> 61.13s]  blank, blank, blank. And I'm like, what's going on? I thought it was a bug on my iPhone.
[61.85s -> 66.57s]  It's not. I've already seen it. I thought it was funny. I laughed at it for a minute.
[68.22s -> 74.39s]  So, all right, you got me. Congratulations. I thought there was no stream today.
[75.27s -> 88.65s]  How did this stream today? What do you mean? Last night we streamed late and I said we're
[88.65s -> 101.74s]  going to go tomorrow too. We tricked him. Yes. Are you going to destroy any more marriages today?
[101.74s -> 105.29s]  I hope not. No, we're going to, we're going to dial it back a little bit.
[106.01s -> 108.81s]  We're going to play. Well, actually, that's, I say that, you know, I'm not, I'm going to stop
[108.81s -> 114.89s]  saying that because every time I say that, every single time that this live stream you've heard
[114.89s -> 119.05s]  German nine, eight, five say, we're going to dial it back tonight. We're going to just chill
[119.05s -> 125.05s]  and play a game and hang out and relax for a few hours. It ends up being like a 15 hour stream.
[125.05s -> 132.17s]  And I lose like 300 hair follicles. So what, you know what? This stream is going to be crazy.
[132.17s -> 136.17s]  It's going to be nuts. I'm going to go nuts on this stream. Okay. That's how, you know,
[136.17s -> 145.77s]  it's not going to happen. My nose blocked up. No, no, my voice sounds nasally. I don't know. Am I?
[145.77s -> 154.65s]  Maybe I got a little, maybe a little, maybe just a little bit. Yeah, maybe a little as I can. It's
[154.65s -> 165.19s]  kind of dusty and allergy out here today, but my voice gets deep. Look, my voice has three or four
[165.19s -> 172.78s]  different places where it sits. This is what I sound like if I, when I don't speak with a little
[172.78s -> 180.90s]  slightly nasally blocked up nose for like 10 hours in six hours. If you keep watching the stream,
[180.90s -> 183.78s]  two or three, four hours from now, my voice is going to sound different. It's going to sound
[183.78s -> 188.42s]  a little higher like this because I've been speaking for a long time. I'm very boisterous
[188.42s -> 193.24s]  right now because I haven't had, there's been no words coming out of my mouth. It's basic science.
[193.88s -> 206.10s]  I literally cannot tell a difference and neither can I. Thanks for coming to class.
[208.18s -> 217.80s]  We're going to play hidden folks today, which is a hidden person object game. I've been told
[217.80s -> 222.76s]  it's really, really fun. I've been told it's, I would, I was told you're going to love this game.
[223.40s -> 235.13s]  I'm like, okay. Am I though? Like, we'll see. Wrong. Well, there's one thing that I do know for
[235.13s -> 242.89s]  certain. We'll switch over to it now. It's, um, what you're about to hear is, well, not that. I
[242.89s -> 247.61s]  mean, that's pretty cool. It was a rumor. You're about to hear every single German nine eight five
[247.61s -> 281.56s]  stream from start to finish. I don't even need to say anything. I should just put this on repeat.
[282.20s -> 293.24s]  Okay. I've made all of these noises before, all of them multiple times.
[294.68s -> 298.92s]  It's hurts. It hurts to hear this. Anyways, I've, I don't know how this game works. I know you've
[298.92s -> 305.00s]  you have to, it's hidden folks. It's like looking in the mirror and I don't want, I don't know,
[305.00s -> 309.82s]  no more looking in the mirror. It's kind of, it's, uh, it hurts my eyes. Hold on.
[315.69s -> 319.75s]  That's better. Which one of these things is better?
[322.70s -> 326.46s]  I don't, I don't like the, all right. Jeremy's,
[326.46s -> 334.42s]  Jerma shut up for a second. I'm trying to talk. I think this one is good. Dark mode always. Yeah.
[334.42s -> 344.54s]  Yeah. He just spit on me. I'll do them all.
[344.54s -> 370.54s]  Oh, this looks worse somehow. Explore Garland is fascinated by the tongue of this reptile.
[376.07s -> 383.67s]  I mean, this is the reptile. There it is. That was, hold on. We need less. We need less German
[383.67s -> 394.71s]  noises. It's already, hold on. All right. That's better. All right. I got it. There it is. Now,
[394.71s -> 414.42s]  what do you want? Isn't that the tongue of the reptile? Now what do you want? Fascinated by the
[414.42s -> 420.82s]  tongue of this reptile. This big snake is a real bush crawler. This looks worse though.
[423.80s -> 425.40s]  I really like this game. Hold on.
[432.42s -> 441.99s]  Oh, that's, hold on. What about the sepia one? Oh, this is, this is all right. This is okay.
[443.11s -> 450.63s]  What does yellow look like? Not bad actually, but I, I need it to be a little bit darker.
[454.71s -> 457.11s]  Yeah. This is better. Should have, maybe I should darken it up a little.
[457.67s -> 469.08s]  This is cool though. Yeah. We're in night mode. Okay. So I got, got you. There's a brightness
[469.08s -> 476.36s]  setting. Oh, is there? Yeah, we got, that's better. Ah, all right. We can get this right.
[476.36s -> 490.70s]  Let's do. Yup. That's what I'm thinking. That's what I'm thinking. Nope. Nope. Nope.
[495.93s -> 499.13s]  I'm going to, it's going to, I don't know who's talking.
[504.87s -> 507.35s]  This is what I'm going with right here. This is perfect. Okay. Here we go.
[507.35s -> 514.46s]  The big snake is, I look for a snake. Snake. I got the chameleon.
[515.91s -> 528.71s]  There's a snake. Anybody see a snake? I don't see a snake. The land of the Jermas. I don't see a
[528.71s -> 536.55s]  snake. Kiki the monkey loves a good soft shelter. I can, I can cut stuff down.
[536.55s -> 560.76s]  Oh, Oh, okay. I get it. I get it. I understand too loud. All right. I'll fix it. I get it. Okay.
[560.76s -> 569.24s]  So now we need to find the snake, the big snake. That's still so loud. Okay. We've got a wink.
[569.80s -> 585.00s]  Okay. Now we need to find the snake. This big snake is a bush crawler.
[585.08s -> 593.75s]  So we need to find the snake. Got the snake. Big snake. It's still so loud.
[593.75s -> 609.91s]  You watched me fucking turn it down. Okay. Now we need Kiki the monkey. It's not you. You in here.
[609.91s -> 623.77s]  A good soft. Okay. Kiki the monkey. Now what? The only ripe white banana is pretty much up for grabs.
[623.77s -> 630.39s]  Oh, isn't everything white in here? Like it's, I can't, there's no, it's too loud. What do you
[630.39s -> 641.94s]  want me to do? The only ripe white banana. Everything is, I can't, there's nothing here.
[641.94s -> 655.32s]  Ripe banana. Pull one of these things. Oh, oh, oh, got it. This game is fucking not even,
[655.32s -> 660.30s]  I almost just said not even fun. I meant to say not even hard. You found everything here.
[660.30s -> 671.58s]  Stay here a little longer. Enter the jungle. Oh boy. Well, now this is a, oh, that was the
[671.58s -> 679.26s]  tutorial. Now we play the real game. For this man in distress, the uncomfortable seat is the
[679.26s -> 687.99s]  least of his troubles. Okay. What else we got? Why are they, why do we still have to hear they're
[687.99s -> 703.14s]  like, if you ask classy Jesse, treetop naps are the best. Treetop. There you go. This game hurts
[703.14s -> 719.22s]  my eyes, man. Sorry. This woman with a guitar plays music that will warm the hearts of men and
[719.22s -> 728.79s]  reptiles. Guitar. I don't even need 10 seconds. Zoom. You zoomer. What do you mean? No. Why would
[728.79s -> 734.01s]  I? Oh my God. No, why would I? Oh, that you can move to. Why would I want to do that? I could see
[734.01s -> 745.48s]  everything here. Oh no. Wishes he had paid more attention during his Tai Chi classes. That you?
[745.48s -> 760.82s]  No. See, why would I zoom in? Okay. And there's woohoo. I'm looking for silhouettes. That's what
[760.82s -> 766.44s]  I'm looking for here. And I, I can, I, I, I can see everything. I can scan this whole environment
[766.44s -> 775.45s]  in one second. Just look, I'm looking for that exact silhouette. My brain has not found it yet.
[775.45s -> 785.66s]  Silhouettes. That's all we're looking for here. There it is. Told you.
[791.59s -> 807.32s]  Fluffy Panda does what Fluffy Pandas do. Eat. Scan the environment. Okay. End in five, four, three,
[808.73s -> 834.23s]  two, one. Fluffy Panda eats. Fluffy Panda eats. Who told him to play this? I don't like 300 people.
[834.23s -> 848.58s]  I'm not done with this yet. Relax. Relax. It's been five minutes. Fluffy Panda likes to eat.
[848.58s -> 855.83s]  It's been 15. We spent five minutes introducing, six minutes picking a color and five minutes in
[855.83s -> 868.68s]  the game. Fluffy Panda. Oh, I can, I forgot I can interact with the environment. Fluffy Panda eats.
[868.68s -> 886.38s]  What is it? Say it again. Where are you? I'm just destroying the whole entire forest to look for
[886.38s -> 897.46s]  this one. Got him. Oh, I did it. Wait, stay here. There's more to do. The others watch jealousy
[897.46s -> 912.47s]  while King Kiki sits on his throne of bananas. Oh, wait, no, he's got a crown. Where's the monkey
[912.47s -> 929.83s]  with the crown? Got you. He sits on the throne of lies. What are you talking about? Long elegant
[929.83s -> 949.72s]  birds lay long elegant eggs. Just give, just give us a few minutes. I like this. All right,
[949.72s -> 960.34s]  let's go. Let's check the next area. Help that walking folk get across. How do I do that?
[963.93s -> 974.84s]  These snakes? How do you, oh, move. Please stop. I'm high as fuck. This game's scaring me.
[975.00s -> 986.94s]  Dude, you're fine. It's not that big of a deal. All right, with the noises, maybe,
[986.94s -> 996.09s]  maybe I could see what you're talking about. Please. I'm working high. What are you doing?
[1004.97s -> 1017.58s]  Cut it down. Make this louder. I'm not going to make it louder. I have to get this bridge over
[1017.58s -> 1037.05s]  here. Oh, I can pull things. I have to click and hold. I like this game because just because of
[1037.05s -> 1053.32s]  this. Cut it down so you can get through. It's just because of the Adam Sandler noises. That's
[1053.32s -> 1064.89s]  why you want to keep playing. That's kind of an interesting game. That's not even an Adam Sandler
[1064.89s -> 1083.00s]  noise. I'm sorry. I disagree. This game's fucking disturbing. It's a cute little hidden object game.
[1083.00s -> 1089.67s]  Why? Oh, dude, I'm on drugs. What the fuck? You can't do an activity that's in like an
[1089.67s -> 1102.12s]  eight-year-old's book when you're like high, apparently, but I probably can't. Yeah. The
[1102.12s -> 1110.58s]  guitar is having a real good conversation with the swing. Got it. Jerma's freaking out. Dude,
[1110.58s -> 1119.05s]  you're on crack, man. Stop being. Aiden really wants to be found. Yeah, what are you smoking?
[1119.05s -> 1125.66s]  What do you do? What drugs are you taking? Oh, man, the swears, the swears. Waldo fucking game. I
[1125.66s -> 1143.50s]  can't. Oh, it's coming at me. The walls are closing now. Air bed. I'm too high for this, man.
[1143.50s -> 1152.63s]  Jerma, I love this game. Also, I had my bunny. What? What happened? Wait, what did it say?
[1152.63s -> 1160.82s]  Jerma, I love this game. I had my bunny since September. I have somebody help me name the
[1160.82s -> 1170.54s]  bunny. It's an all black bunny. How about, uh, how about, I don't know, um, uh, how about, uh,
[1171.34s -> 1179.10s]  Jetson? Yeah, that's pretty good. All right, what's this one? With filthy hands, the bullies
[1179.10s -> 1186.15s]  quickly return to the campfire. Ella will never find her hairbrush. All right, which one of the
[1186.15s -> 1198.52s]  bullies has the hair? I did not get it. Filthy hands. It's in, it's inside the fire. Pepper's
[1198.52s -> 1212.38s]  pretty good. Pepper is pretty good, you know. Where's his hairbrush? Wait, no, I thought that
[1212.38s -> 1223.93s]  was gonna be in there. With filthy hands? Jerma, quick, say something funny. Sure. Ban that guy
[1223.93s -> 1231.83s]  for expecting me to be his personal clown. Funny enough for you.
[1241.19s -> 1249.21s]  All right, I'm done. I'm not doing this anymore. This is too much. No, I'm not. I'm still here.
[1249.21s -> 1257.67s]  We got a wink? You said I shaved? Nobody even commented on that. Why has nobody commented on
[1257.67s -> 1267.40s]  the fact that I shaved? Like, I mean, I do something and nobody's seen, nobody notices.
[1275.14s -> 1287.21s]  We couldn't see. Yes, you could. All right, where are we going? Beekeeper Barry. I'm still here. I
[1287.21s -> 1294.34s]  mean, guys, everybody relax. Relax. This is just, this is the pregame. Relax. This is the pregame
[1294.34s -> 1302.52s]  to Mega Man Legends. I wanted to play this for a little, for a little bit. But guys, everybody
[1302.52s -> 1312.71s]  just cool. Just cool off. You have an Instagram filter on. I do not have an Instagram filter on.
[1312.71s -> 1324.33s]  I don't even know how to use that. Beekeeper, Beekeeper Barry. All right, there's the bees.
[1325.05s -> 1331.64s]  Beekeeper Barry, where is he? Beekeeper Barry.
[1332.52s -> 1348.14s]  Fuck, I'm getting interested. Harriet, am I making the bee sounds? No. What if I just stay here for
[1348.14s -> 1361.05s]  like five hours and just play this all day? Am I? All right, listen. Mai releases every butterfly
[1361.05s -> 1382.47s]  she catches. That's why there's still so many of them here. Oh, no. Where are you? Where are you?
[1382.47s -> 1394.22s]  You're going to only have one viewer of me. I'm not even watching my own stream. What you meant
[1394.22s -> 1401.35s]  to say was zero. That means I would have to have my own stream open, which I don't. Let me just find
[1402.15s -> 1411.29s]  Mai, please. I want to check this game out. I got Mega Man Legends sitting in the tray right now.
[1411.29s -> 1437.38s]  What tray? In the PS2 tray? I like this game. You guys are too harsh. Where are the butterflies? Wait,
[1437.38s -> 1446.65s]  I see a butterfly right here. That's a clue. Let's see you foster this harshness.
[1448.17s -> 1455.99s]  Don't blame me. I'm playing the game. I'm playing this game. I like this game. What do you mean?
[1456.63s -> 1462.31s]  If I was fostering something, I'd be fostering you enjoying this game because I like it. That's me
[1462.31s -> 1485.05s]  fostering. I got to find this person. No Mega Man until I find this person. By liking the game,
[1485.05s -> 1494.36s]  you make chat hate it. What am I, your parents? What are you? What? Dude, I found this really
[1494.36s -> 1500.52s]  cool game today called Hidden Folks. No way, dude. Is it fun? Yeah, it's so cool, dude. You like find
[1500.52s -> 1506.07s]  monsters and pigs and there's fucking people here. Dude, that's awesome. Let's play it. Oh,
[1506.07s -> 1512.26s]  I'm so into it. We're both hitting or hovering over our desk. The fucking door opens. What are
[1512.26s -> 1516.47s]  you boys doing in there? Oh, we're just playing this game called Hidden Folks, Ma. You wouldn't
[1516.47s -> 1522.79s]  even like it. You're an idiot older. Oh, Hidden Folks. What are you looking for? Ma? Oh, she's
[1522.79s -> 1529.53s]  right over here. Boys, if you need help with anything else, especially with Lumberjack Fleck,
[1529.53s -> 1536.30s]  I know where that is too. I beat this game last night. Fuck out of here, Ma. Fine. I don't even
[1536.30s -> 1545.29s]  like this game, Ma. Mike, do you like this game? Yeah, you do. Fucking loser. No, I don't. This
[1545.29s -> 1555.10s]  game's a fucking loser. Yeah, I don't like it either. What am I doing right now? All right,
[1555.10s -> 1562.62s]  I'm like projecting, I'm fostering some hatred here on you guys. That's all right. All right.
[1563.50s -> 1574.47s]  Let's go. I'm going to play Mega Man Legends, but I have to find these people first.
[1577.05s -> 1581.94s]  I'm not leaving until I find the bat. I don't care. I don't care if every single person leaves
[1581.94s -> 1598.23s]  this frame. I have to, I'm going to beat this level. Are these every butterfly she catches?
[1598.23s -> 1614.73s]  That's why there's still so many of them. Found the bat. Monster Mo. All right, what about this
[1614.73s -> 1618.73s]  one? We'll go back to this. Hayden tried to escape the internet, but he put his tent next to the
[1618.73s -> 1640.36s]  only Wi-Fi point of the campground. Is there a cell tower here? Oh, I found her. Hayden tried to
[1640.36s -> 1649.74s]  escape the internet. It's over here. Campground's over here, right? No, the campground's down here.
[1651.11s -> 1663.58s]  Oh, there's the Wi-Fi spot. Where is he? Is that a secret? No. There you are. Got it.
[1665.50s -> 1671.50s]  Mom, can we please play Mega Man? No, not until you've done your homework, which is
[1672.86s -> 1680.73s]  watch this guy play hidden folks as your only assignment. You can't even do that. What the
[1680.73s -> 1692.74s]  heck? No ice cream for you after dinner. Who's this dog? The sun is shining too brightly today,
[1692.74s -> 1701.66s]  even for classy Jessie. That's not her. For all an unusual punishment.
[1703.26s -> 1715.38s]  Key? This is satisfying. It's a really satisfying game. What about this one? Lumberjack? What's that?
[1716.02s -> 1739.83s]  Sun is shining too brightly on like a beach camping. In the car? Maybe you're in the car.
[1744.28s -> 1759.48s]  I don't know where she is. This is kind of fucked up, by the way.
[1764.15s -> 1788.97s]  I'm just some otherworldly force opening up everybody's tents. No, no. Where are you? Right
[1788.97s -> 1805.70s]  here? No. No. Oh, chat. Vote on this. You don't vote on an unofficial poll. Guys, the unofficial
[1805.70s -> 1815.77s]  poll is the same thing as... All right. If you guys all... Unofficial poll. That's like watching
[1815.77s -> 1821.93s]  a TV show and being like, oh man, I really hope they kill off this character next.
[1821.93s -> 1828.92s]  Let's all vote for it and send it to the fucking CEO at Disney. CEO at Disney is going to read it
[1828.92s -> 1836.14s]  and be like, what's this? Who do they want? Who do they want to die next to the show? Oh, I would
[1836.14s -> 1842.07s]  throw it in the trash, but I get fucking a hundred of these a week and the trash is full every day.
[1842.07s -> 1863.14s]  So I'm just going to rip it in half. Recycle this, please. Where is this person? At least he's
[1863.14s -> 1876.36s]  recycling. Not realistic. Disney CEO wouldn't recycle. She's classy. Yeah, but what does that
[1876.36s -> 1894.70s]  mean? I mean, look at the results. Where are the... What is the poll? Let me see it. Let me see it.
[1894.70s -> 1905.64s]  It says, do you think Jerma could beat this game? No. Omega lol. Yes. Oh, I see what's going on here.
[1905.64s -> 1912.12s]  Okay. This is really interesting part of the stream. This is like a thousand of you. This is
[1912.20s -> 1916.20s]  very interesting. So like about, but probably like 700 of you are like, no, I want him to keep
[1916.20s -> 1921.45s]  fucking playing this game. Like I like this game. This is like kind of cool experience. This is like
[1921.45s -> 1927.13s]  fun to me. So let's say, let's make him think he can't beat it. So then he stays and tries to
[1927.13s -> 1930.81s]  prove us wrong. It works, but the Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring, it has to work
[1930.81s -> 1934.57s]  with something like this because he's already interested. It's not going to work. I already
[1934.57s -> 1962.39s]  know that. The sun is shining too brightly. Are there more than one campground? It's working.
[1963.29s -> 1964.57s]  Chat, keep up the pressure.
[1979.83s -> 1986.90s]  Classy Jesse found anybody who likes this game. Also, I'm not reading the rest of that. What the
[1986.90s -> 1992.58s]  fuck are you talking about? Lumberjack. All right, we got one more. Lumberjack flex stands in front
[1992.58s -> 2003.38s]  of his grand final challenge. Forest or a tree or wood or cutting or like a huge tree or something.
[2003.38s -> 2021.03s]  I mean, there's a bunch of trees. Zuma was a big tree. That's pretty big. That's pretty big.
[2021.03s -> 2028.09s]  Not that big though. That's there it is. He's blind. He's blind. He's blind. He's blind. He's
[2028.09s -> 2037.85s]  blind. He's blind. He's blind. No, I can't move on. Oh shit. This banana was parked into a fruit
[2037.85s -> 2048.60s]  basket. What about this one? This truffle is about to be discovered by a hog. Together with her bunny,
[2048.68s -> 2052.92s]  friends, Black Bitty hides in a hole chewing on some snatched wheat.
[2054.63s -> 2061.38s]  Ivan hitched a ride without permission. It doesn't have an escape plan. What are you guys doing right
[2061.38s -> 2076.06s]  now? I don't get it. I don't understand. What does this have to do with anything going on right now?
[2076.06s -> 2099.50s]  Is that what you think I'm doing right now? Somebody wrote LUL fuck chat. Do what you want to do.
[2101.34s -> 2111.61s]  Oh, I am. See, I said Mega Man Legends was coming, but I don't even own that game. I just made that
[2111.61s -> 2118.82s]  up completely. I don't have that. This spider has a particular taste. All right. There was a spider
[2118.82s -> 2139.22s]  over here. I don't understand. Fuck me. I don't even own Mega Man Legends. I just own Mega Man
[2139.22s -> 2155.19s]  Legends 2. I have to fucking have the sequel and not the first one. What's wrong with my floor?
[2156.07s -> 2169.67s]  I just picked up the PlayStation 2 controller instead of the mouse. Hi, nice to see you. It's
[2169.67s -> 2173.19s]  time for Mega Man. It's not time for Mega Man. You'll know when it's time for Mega Man.
[2174.15s -> 2180.54s]  It's how you know it's time for me to switch a game. I usually don't talk for about 30 straight
[2180.54s -> 2194.66s]  seconds. I go, all right. Okay. That's cool. I haven't done that yet. Usually it's a lot of,
[2196.10s -> 2204.76s]  all right, where's this thing? Cool. When you hear me fill air time, because there's nothing
[2204.76s -> 2208.57s]  interesting going on for me in the game or I have nothing interesting to tell you. That's how you
[2208.57s -> 2217.50s]  know like to start the countdown for about five minutes. All right. Rock pile, rock pile.
[2225.18s -> 2231.50s]  Dog, cool dog. Yeah. Saying things that I'm currently touching or what just the actual
[2231.50s -> 2236.39s]  noun. That's how you know it's like the person's done with the game they're playing. Because I'm
[2236.39s -> 2242.95s]  a streamer, right? So it's like, was it just dead air? No, I'm not going to have dead air.
[2242.95s -> 2256.01s]  Tractor riding along in the tractor. Oh, beep beep. You know, tractors. That's how you know.
[2256.01s -> 2260.10s]  And this is not just me. This is every streamer you've ever watched. You'll see it. You'll,
[2260.10s -> 2267.99s]  you can see it now. You'll know. All right. Ivan hitched a ride without permission.
[2267.99s -> 2274.36s]  Doesn't have an escape plan. So he's over here. He's like under the one of the cars.
[2275.16s -> 2288.50s]  That's not him. It's to ride without permission. No, saying the thing like this, saying any word
[2288.50s -> 2297.93s]  or phrase like this. Okay. It's to ride without permission. No. All right. I'm not doing that
[2297.93s -> 2313.82s]  anymore. All right. Where is he? Where is he? Over here? Nope. He's lying down somewhere.
[2323.46s -> 2323.94s]  Wow.
[2339.14s -> 2344.49s]  If he was going to be somewhere, he'd be down here. It's beaker.
[2344.49s -> 2353.51s]  Beaker. No, that's not beaker. Let's get him to do a whole symphony though. Cover your ears.
[2353.51s -> 2363.62s]  It's probably going to hurt. Can't figure out what's, what's germa and what's this game.
[2363.62s -> 2373.69s]  What's germa? What's germa? Well, what's germa? I can help you out there. What's germa? What's
[2373.69s -> 2383.93s]  germa? But I, but that's a good question. If I were to think, well, let's answer the second
[2383.93s -> 2389.22s]  question first. Second question is, this is a hidden folks game about hidden objects,
[2389.22s -> 2410.87s]  but here's the thing. What is germa? Hey you, person that just landed on the channel page.
[2410.87s -> 2415.59s]  What's going on? My name is germa985. Or you can just call me germa. That's what most people around
[2415.59s -> 2420.23s]  here call me. I'm a gaming channel. You probably could guess that by all the different playlists
[2420.23s -> 2425.27s]  and all the videos below, which you should check out and you should go watch some of them right now
[2425.27s -> 2429.43s]  and possibly subscribe. That's the whole purpose of this video. I'm trying to get you to subscribe
[2429.43s -> 2433.59s]  to my channel. So hey, subscribe to the channel. Subscribe. You see on this channel, I like to call
[2433.59s -> 2439.91s]  myself Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Germa, because I have two different sides. I have the very professional
[2439.91s -> 2445.91s]  side where I review content and I review packages. What? I don't review packages. No, I don't do that.
[2445.91s -> 2451.27s]  I review like games. Oh, here's like, here's a cup. This cup is good. There's a whole lot of stuff
[2451.27s -> 2457.99s]  here though. I have my fun. I have my professional side and I mold them together into sort of this
[2457.99s -> 2463.51s]  lunacy that is germa985. So hopefully this little trailer will be able to give you an explanation.
[2463.51s -> 2469.51s]  Did you review packages at once? You subscribe as well. So please subscribe, subscribe,
[2469.51s -> 2474.39s]  and subscribe. And I'll subscribe to you all next time. And of course, subscribe, subscribe.
[2474.39s -> 2481.86s]  Oh, I hate it. I hate it. Hey, what is going on everybody? Hey, what is going on everybody?
[2481.86s -> 2487.54s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Germa here. Who is this guy anyway? To gameplay commentary.
[2487.54s -> 2492.50s]  Meet me at the statue at 12 o'clock. Okay. I don't know what the statue is. I don't play this game.
[2493.78s -> 2497.62s]  No, what? Oh, what was that? You were going to bank what? What were you going to do?
[2500.10s -> 2507.06s]  Oh, there we go. So of course, as Mario, you have to do all the dirty work because
[2507.70s -> 2512.90s]  you can jump real high. I never understood that by the way that why does Mario have to do everything?
[2512.90s -> 2516.50s]  He's like the savior of the world because he can jump higher than Michael Jordan.
[2517.22s -> 2522.58s]  Right. Left or right. We're going to go left. Oh man.
[2528.46s -> 2533.90s]  Fucking scary game. I knew it. I knew what was going to happen too. And it still doesn't matter.
[2533.90s -> 2538.70s]  What I'm talking about here is you'll see it. I go like me, me, me, me, almost like I'm sweeping
[2538.70s -> 2544.30s]  the screen, not with my mouse, but with my A and D keys. And it's something I don't know why I do
[2544.30s -> 2549.02s]  this. And I think it's because I have a lot of trouble aiming with the mouse more so than I do,
[2549.02s -> 2554.06s]  which just kind of getting people in front of my cross here, but I kill every single person almost
[2554.06s -> 2568.33s]  by doing the sway in quotes. Oh no, I'm dead. Who did this? It's Otto. Okay. I don't want to alarm
[2568.33s -> 2574.17s]  anybody here, but I'm sorry. I may have taken a shit in your house. Being one of the top 10 players
[2574.17s -> 2579.53s]  in the world. That's right. This is Germany's grandfather here. Not Germany. He's not as good
[2579.53s -> 2584.73s]  as me. He can't give me the tips. He can't give me the strategies that I can. So let me just tell
[2584.73s -> 2589.13s]  you that I'm one of the best players in the world and I'll show you right here. Look at this. Get the
[2589.13s -> 2595.77s]  fuck out of here, buddy. Let me tell you. Did I really have this in me the whole time? And the
[2595.77s -> 2601.53s]  answer is yes. Yes. Everybody does. We all do. Everybody has it in them. You have it in you. You
[2601.53s -> 2605.53s]  do do it. You can actually do it. Oh, you just have to tell yourself it's possible and you have
[2605.53s -> 2624.87s]  to act on those possibilities. Oh, what a sick trick. Hi guys. Today we're going to create a
[2624.87s -> 2632.47s]  fucking washer dryer on Jeremy's channel. This is so long. All right, fine. Right here. So he
[2632.47s -> 2638.55s]  already finished it. So thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it and hopefully
[2638.63s -> 2644.87s]  you subscribe to his channel. Hopefully I have convinced you to do that and you can be part of
[2644.87s -> 2649.91s]  our little community here, The Germs. So join The Germs. I hope to see you all in the comments
[2649.91s -> 2654.95s]  section and thank you for watching again. So take care everybody. I'll see you all soon.
[2656.23s -> 2662.63s]  So that's somebody. Who's German on A5? That's who he is. Did you subscribe to
[2662.63s -> 2675.70s]  the channel yet? I don't know. That video needed to be three and a half minutes shorter than it was,
[2676.74s -> 2691.26s]  but this is like 2011 YouTube. Come on. Delete that video on stream. That video actually does
[2691.26s -> 2698.38s]  not exist anymore. It's like, I think that's a private. This video is private. I just showed
[2698.38s -> 2716.39s]  you a private video or unlisted at least. Make that your sub sub. All right. Anyways, what were
[2716.39s -> 2720.55s]  we doing? So the person that just came in, what is, what is German? I don't get it. And what is
[2720.55s -> 2725.91s]  this? Hopefully we answered both those questions. You probably left 15 seconds into that video.
[2726.07s -> 2733.38s]  But if you were still here, thanks for watching. All right. So we got the spider. I was over here.
[2733.38s -> 2740.74s]  I saw the spider web right there. It's right here. What do you mean? It's right here.
[2740.74s -> 2759.37s]  Video shouldn't be public. Actually the video should not be public. I don't know. Whatever.
[2759.37s -> 2770.06s]  But it has like 30,000 views. Save it quick. I'm not, what do you think? I'm going to just
[2770.06s -> 2779.94s]  delete that video. I got to get this one. I haven't hitched a ride without permission.
[2783.86s -> 2793.46s]  It's gotta be like this car park here. Is he just inside one of these?
[2797.05s -> 2803.03s]  There's no escape. Super Bruce. Thanks for the six community subs. Thank you Bruce.
[2803.67s -> 2816.38s]  Thanks for the subs. Hey, thanks for subscribing to the channel. All right. I need, I gotta, I gotta
[2816.38s -> 2819.26s]  level with chat here for a second. A lot of you guys might be newer viewers. Listen to me.
[2820.70s -> 2829.08s]  There was a time, I'll get on cam for this. There was a time between 2010 and like 2013
[2829.96s -> 2834.68s]  but I didn't even swear on this channel. I didn't know what I wanted the channel to be.
[2835.48s -> 2840.66s]  I didn't know if I wanted the channel to be a channel where I did, I was a professional
[2840.66s -> 2845.62s]  reviewer or something. This is like, nobody knew what the fuck they were doing back in like 2012.
[2846.18s -> 2854.23s]  No one. Not one person did. And now there's fist formulas for all this shit now. It is where
[2854.23s -> 2860.31s]  everybody's at that everyone's got the perfect way to do everything now. 10 years ago it was like
[2860.31s -> 2868.28s]  there are people watching my YouTube channel. Why? What do I do? Wait, what? There's how many
[2868.28s -> 2873.78s]  people, how many people clicked on that video? Why did they click on that video? Did I do more
[2873.78s -> 2879.74s]  of that? What should I do? Should I do like, should I do like another TF2 video? Should I do,
[2879.74s -> 2885.66s]  I'm gonna do this grandpa video. I think. Yeah. I think that's what I'm gonna do. I hope. And then
[2885.66s -> 2893.43s]  you make videos like that trying to like, it was different. It was, it was the wild west. It was
[2893.43s -> 2898.71s]  the wild. I never did clickbait videos. No, I didn't. No fucking way. Not in a million years.
[2898.71s -> 2912.54s]  No, I did not. I refuse to believe that. When, when did I do a clickbait video? I never ever,
[2912.54s -> 2924.50s]  ever did that. Ha ha. Oh God. Ha ha. Oh God is me not knowing what I want to title a video,
[2924.50s -> 2931.54s]  not clickbait. That's, I have no title for this. So it's going to be a TF2 uncensored
[2932.50s -> 2936.42s]  German. Ha ha. Oh God. I don't have any other words to describe the video. So I was going to
[2936.42s -> 2950.02s]  write ha ha. Oh God. Give me a clickbait TF2, bring on the thunder. That's not clickbait. That
[2950.02s -> 2958.50s]  happened. I got clickbaited in that video. Don't you understand the purpose of this video was I
[2958.50s -> 2976.36s]  was clickbaited. I was baited in this video and I was very upset by it. Watch it on stream. No,
[2976.36s -> 2984.23s]  no, I'm trying to hold on. Let me get through level one of find the hidden people. Somebody said,
[2984.31s -> 2987.43s]  what about the video where you said this is the scariest game ever? I really thought it was.
[2987.43s -> 2999.27s]  I really thought it was. It was the scariest game ever. And the reason why I thought it was
[2999.27s -> 3007.19s]  the scariest game ever. Okay. If you were to go back to like the 1700s and you brought a DVD
[3008.09s -> 3014.33s]  of Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill, and you gave it and you brought a TV and you plugged it in
[3014.33s -> 3017.85s]  somehow. You got it to work and you, and you watch, you showed like the pilgrims fucking
[3017.85s -> 3022.14s]  Jack and Jill. That would be the, they would be like, holy fuck. This is the most insane,
[3022.14s -> 3024.94s]  ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life. This is the best, but it's just called a movie.
[3024.94s -> 3030.25s]  That's the best movie I've ever seen in my life because they have no, they didn't have any other
[3030.25s -> 3037.66s]  experiences watching any other movies. So I didn't play that many scary games. So that was
[3037.66s -> 3042.42s]  the scariest game I had played, but there was a million of the scary games that I hadn't played
[3042.42s -> 3051.38s]  yet. They had Shakespeare. It doesn't matter. I have a magical box that plays Adam Sandler on a
[3051.38s -> 3057.72s]  TV. This one is actually clickbait. No, it's not. I'll give you, I can explain all of them.
[3057.72s -> 3080.89s]  What is it? I didn't, I didn't make this video. I didn't make this video. Games that you see in
[3080.89s -> 3091.50s]  this chat. I'm just going to get it off with because, wait, hold on. Wait, everybody, everybody
[3091.50s -> 3098.46s]  settle down for a second. I got to get this. Okay. Hold on. I can rebuttal this. I really can.
[3098.46s -> 3115.08s]  You give me any of these, I'll rebuttal them. This is painful. I bet I can't load anything.
[3115.08s -> 3119.00s]  You used to switch to Boost Mobile. You get four free phones when you switch. Switch to Boost Mobile
[3119.00s -> 3123.24s]  and get four lines for $25 per line per month with unlimited data and four free Samsung Galaxy A20
[3123.24s -> 3127.80s]  phones on our super reliable, super fast network. No, I didn't even get paid for that. One of the
[3127.80s -> 3135.10s]  most requested games that you see in this chat. I'm just going to get it off with because
[3136.62s -> 3143.10s]  it's all everybody talks about before every stream. It's based on a bunch of fucking animated
[3143.10s -> 3149.18s]  characters, like your fucking anime bullshit that everybody seems to like these days. Animated
[3149.18s -> 3163.14s]  character. Can't wait. We're just going to get it over with real quick. Of course I'm talking
[3163.14s -> 3170.58s]  about Garfield car. How's that clickbait? That's just me. Let's do it. I'll get you and I'll look
[3170.58s -> 3180.41s]  like a bloody accident. How about this? If I don't win this race, then, okay, if I don't win
[3180.49s -> 3189.88s]  this race, come in first place, then I will, I will beat Doki Doki Literature Club on stream
[3189.88s -> 3197.24s]  10 times in a row. Holy fuck. When did that? Why did I do that? All right. Focus now. Okay.
[3198.60s -> 3206.18s]  If I do not find the rabbit within the next 10 minutes, I will beat Doki Doki Literature Club
[3206.18s -> 3219.30s]  on stream 10 times in a row.
[3272.66s -> 3273.62s]  That's wheat, right?
[3304.50s -> 3307.22s]  Why didn't I say the mushroom? Why didn't I say the mushroom?
[3333.27s -> 3346.81s]  Get the fuck out of here. Don't have to do it. Three winks. Did it.
[3349.69s -> 3351.53s]  Fortress Raphael dries in the sun.
[3356.49s -> 3360.17s]  You have a Snapchat filter on. You don't want to show. Okay.
[3361.21s -> 3366.89s]  Jerma, Jerma, you got a Snapchat filter on. That's why you look so good today. Fine. We'll turn,
[3366.89s -> 3377.26s]  we'll turn, we'll get it on all the defaults. You ready? Fine. You want to see? I'll turn off
[3377.26s -> 3388.44s]  all the filters. All right. That's the, that's the smoother I turned off because I had kind of a
[3388.52s -> 3399.48s]  glossy look today. Turn off this one. I had a, I had a lip reducer that was on too.
[3401.72s -> 3418.55s]  Had a shine removal and there was a gloss there over there. Okay.
[3420.81s -> 3432.81s]  The what? Do I look any different? Oh, actually kind of a little bit. It's not even that much.
[3435.37s -> 3437.61s]  It's not that much. Turn them all back on.
[3450.18s -> 3473.14s]  That's better. That link, what? Stop doing that with your head.
[3477.30s -> 3483.30s]  So I stopped doing, stop doing the like, I need to be, I need to, I want to tilt my head in every
[3483.30s -> 3493.93s]  photo. That's what people, that's what people do. Hold on, hold on. We can't even get through
[3493.93s -> 3506.92s]  one level of this game guys. What is this? Why do I have this? Why is this saved? Why is this saved
[3506.92s -> 3531.48s]  in OBS? Why is this in OBS? What is this image called? This is just in OBS. That's actually a
[3531.48s -> 3550.52s]  scary image. I don't know, you know how you did that that fast. Guys, that's, that was like 42
[3550.52s -> 3559.43s]  seconds. How the fuck did you do that? Do you guys just have Photoshop ready and you just,
[3559.43s -> 3567.34s]  I don't even, how do you even do it that fast? All right, where's, I gotta find this person.
[3569.91s -> 3588.15s]  Oh, by the way, hey, listen up. All right, this is important. Listen. No, you gotta do,
[3588.15s -> 3616.31s]  you gotta do the side one, the side one. Hey, listen to me. I'm trying, hey, listen.
[3617.03s -> 3623.32s]  It's Kim and I's anniversary tonight. What do you think about that?
[3629.48s -> 3646.95s]  Four years. Long time. What am I doing here? I said tonight, tonight, we got plans. We got plans,
[3646.95s -> 3653.51s]  me and her. I'm streaming. No, no, I'm streaming right now, but we got plans tonight and tomorrow.
[3657.43s -> 3668.52s]  I gotta find Ivan. That's why you shaved. This dude leaves his girlfriend for big bits.
[3670.18s -> 3677.08s]  Oh, why did I say that out loud? No, just forget it. Where's Ivan?
[3682.98s -> 3693.53s]  Yeah. Okay. I'm kind of, I kind of can't stand these noises anymore. How do you guys watch this
[3693.53s -> 3699.67s]  stream? It's taking me an hour and two minutes to be like, nah, I don't want to hear these noises
[3699.67s -> 3716.70s]  ever again. We don't. All right. There's no, he's not down here. He's right here. Probably.
[3724.57s -> 3725.37s]  Bathroom doors.
[3725.53s -> 3738.17s]  All right. I have no idea what this guy is. There's only, the cars, they're only here.
[3739.93s -> 3753.77s]  He's a stowaway. He gets to ride without permission. That's not him. And he can't escape.
[3769.72s -> 3772.04s]  Oh, shit. Wait.
[3772.04s -> 3781.66s]  Wait. Where the hell is he? Well, that's a tortoise, right?
[3792.33s -> 3799.62s]  All right. Let's go. Why it takes his job as a wheat supervisor very seriously.
[3804.98s -> 3807.22s]  I bet you German never even kissed anyone before.
[3813.16s -> 3834.20s]  Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork versus hay.
[3834.20s -> 3846.68s]  Where's the fucking hay? Wouldn't it be right here? Hitchfork. Hitchfork versus hay.
[3858.81s -> 3875.10s]  Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork.
[3885.02s -> 3887.10s]  This picture makes me laugh every time.
[3890.46s -> 3904.89s]  That's like the ultimate narcissist photo.
[3908.97s -> 3914.41s]  Yeah, it is. Imagine if you were that, like, follow yourself that only you...
[3918.60s -> 3924.60s]  This can't be even real. Make this the thumbnail. I'm not going to make this the thumbnail of the
[3924.68s -> 3934.78s]  stream. So you want me to sit here like this for like two straight minutes to make sure this is
[3934.78s -> 3957.58s]  the thumbnail on the stream. No! Did it already happen? No, it didn't already happen. Stop blinking
[3957.58s -> 3980.49s]  me that weird picture of my face. That's top tier clickbait. I can play. I'm sexually attracted to
[3980.49s -> 3987.50s]  me. If you water your crops well and give them a little bit of extra attention, you may see this
[3987.50s -> 4003.88s]  flower. Got it. All right, ForresterAman is as much an artist as he is a lumberjack.
[4004.76s -> 4017.24s]  All right, he's an artist. Artist, artist, artist, artist, artist. What are you doing?
[4017.24s -> 4024.33s]  It's another one of those streams, huh? It's another one of those... Here comes
[4024.33s -> 4045.45s]  an image every three minutes. It's one of those. Yeah, that's not even turned the right way.
[4050.50s -> 4079.34s]  Oh! Oh! Oh! What is this? What the fuck is this? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, that's the New Year's kiss.
[4079.90s -> 4091.64s]  Here's the thing, though. Okay, everybody looks like that when they kiss somebody.
[4091.64s -> 4099.64s]  You ever... Here's a little tip to make yourself... Take your iPhone and put it
[4099.64s -> 4106.52s]  right up to your fucking face and close your eyes and go like that and tell me what it looks like.
[4106.52s -> 4114.90s]  Go like this. Go like this. Take your phone. Go like this. You're going to look like that.
[4115.46s -> 4172.31s]  I'll do it right now. Okay, here we go. Ready? You see? Okay, so exhibit A. I rest my case.
[4197.11s -> 4204.76s]  Who cares about the fucking pizza guys? He's avoiding playing this. No, I'm not.
[4207.96s -> 4218.26s]  I can't even. Guys, there's too many pictures you have here. You have too many photos.
[4224.55s -> 4231.35s]  Oh god. It looks like I'm made out of clay. Oh, all right. All right. All right. Okay. All right.
[4231.35s -> 4240.55s]  It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time to go. It's time to go. It's time to play. I'm playing.
[4240.55s -> 4245.35s]  It's time to play the game. That's the thumbnail now. Okay, that's fine. It's all right. It's time
[4245.35s -> 4258.50s]  to go. Show us. Hold on. I don't even know what image it is. Not this one. It's not that one.
[4258.50s -> 4263.10s]  Where is it? And just like the crowd in the background making all these fucked up noises.
[4263.66s -> 4281.77s]  You guys ever fucking think that like Intel is going to approach me for anything?
[4282.86s -> 4290.98s]  No, not this one. Not this guy. What? The title is perfect. Oh, all right. All right.
[4295.30s -> 4304.46s]  All right. Artist and a lumberjack. It's time to tell your girlfriend you love her.
[4306.33s -> 4321.82s]  I just found a chicken. Yeah, I've now. Oh, there's a cow. Wait. Oh, that's not you.

[4330.74s -> 4532.23s]  going to get coffee quick right now. All right. Anybody find this? Anybody find this person?
[4535.24s -> 4538.68s]  You lost viewers. What the fuck? No, are you fucking kidding me?
[4539.56s -> 4549.24s]  How many? How many? How many? No, what the fuck? 100, 200, 300, 500 got stupid. Oh,
[4549.24s -> 4554.01s]  I've never taken another break ever again. All right. Where's uh, where's this person?
[4554.65s -> 4572.12s]  We're going to find the art artist artist. It's right there, dude. Hold on. He's a lumberjack.
[4572.20s -> 4584.06s]  He's an artist. We got a wink. I'm, I'm getting really tired of doing that.
[4587.05s -> 4592.34s]  I didn't think I didn't think it was going to take. Um, I don't think I thought it was going
[4592.34s -> 4599.46s]  to be way longer. People have to get to 75,000. I'm done. I'm tired with the links, but they can't,
[4599.46s -> 4607.42s]  I can't move them. I can't leave. I have to stay. It's like in two months. Oh, right. That's
[4607.42s -> 4613.13s]  you're right. It's been a while. Okay. Who is this guy? It's time to get some fruity physics
[4613.13s -> 4619.00s]  into Newton's head. All right. Here it is. I didn't even take me one second.
[4622.14s -> 4624.30s]  Okay. Anymore apple to drop on somebody's head.
[4627.90s -> 4631.18s]  Apple, apple. There it is.
[4631.18s -> 4660.22s]  This is interesting. Did the Joker laugh? Why did the Joker laugh right now? How appropriate
[4660.22s -> 4670.49s]  would a Joker laugh be right now? We already, we just talked about this.
[4671.21s -> 4672.57s]  We just talked about this.
[4676.46s -> 4686.54s]  Scarecrow. Oh, here we go. Where is this? Fake Bull Barney is not moved by this pen. Maybe
[4686.54s -> 4690.66s]  because he's fake and has no feelings. Fake Bull Barney.
[4692.97s -> 4697.40s]  Yes. Fake Bull Barney. Five minutes on the clock.
[4701.29s -> 4704.49s]  Needle might not be in a haystack, but she sure knows how to roll.
[4707.61s -> 4713.19s]  Clues. Cool clues. What? No.
[4729.59s -> 4736.79s]  There you go. Oh, I did it. Oh, let's stay here for now. Okay. We have another image
[4736.79s -> 4768.60s]  that's circulating. Okay. What's wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you guys?
[4769.24s -> 4796.58s]  Why did you do this? Why would you make this? Okay. No.
[4803.91s -> 4813.19s]  It's like, it's the fact that it's come out of the coat. He's like five, five. He's like five, six.
[4814.39s -> 4817.91s]  Why is it like a person? What are you doing?
[4818.47s -> 4836.65s]  Okay. No. Community crack night. No, it is kind of. I hope to God that's not the thumbnail because
[4836.65s -> 4842.49s]  that would be really fucked up. No, I've been doing too much fucked up shit on the screen.
[4845.06s -> 4849.06s]  All right. Too many. All right. We got to dial back the fucked up stuff.
[4849.70s -> 4862.26s]  Okay. Oh, look. It's me as the Joker. It's full moon. It's just constant images.
[4862.98s -> 4868.12s]  I did. I said it was going to be crazy and I should, I do. I shouldn't have said that.
[4868.68s -> 4881.34s]  I should have said it was going to be chill. Constant conflict. No, I saw that one. It's not
[4881.34s -> 4890.97s]  the thumbnail. All right. Where's this fish? This rotting fish is repelling potential customers.
[4895.18s -> 4896.62s]  Well, here's the market down here.
[4907.00s -> 4920.12s]  Come on. Where is it? Here's the fish. That's be close, right?
[4926.60s -> 4930.12s]  Drawing away potential colors like a trash can somewhere. It's rotting fish.
[4970.98s -> 4987.51s]  Okay. Good. All right. I got to turn. I got to mute. Where's this fish?
[5004.78s -> 5012.42s]  Which staff and scrolling by that thumbnail be like, I got to click on this one.
[5018.30s -> 5034.10s]  Where's this fish? The hell is this? It's right here somewhere. It has to be.
[5034.74s -> 5064.06s]  Where is it? Shit. Is there another market scaring off potential customers? Oh, wait.
[5064.06s -> 5075.13s]  What's going on down here? There's only two. There's a scarecrow in this fish and then needle.
[5075.13s -> 5079.62s]  Oh, got you. No, shit. Really? There you are.
[5081.78s -> 5096.82s]  Staff is here. Everybody, quick. Duck. I keep passing the fish.
[5105.53s -> 5114.94s]  Well, I found that. That's good. No, don't scatter. No, no, no, no, no. Just everybody.
[5116.49s -> 5122.01s]  I'm having a family reunion party. We're all family here. Your brothers, sisters,
[5122.01s -> 5125.29s]  your cousins, your relatives. This is like thousands of us. We do it every year.
[5125.29s -> 5135.69s]  Shit. Stop. Stop. Shut up. All right. Fuck it. I'm going to the next one.
[5135.69s -> 5141.10s]  Fabian wants to get back to the festival, but the signs aren't helping him.
[5141.10s -> 5145.59s]  Oh, God. Oh, this is not going to be good.
[5146.73s -> 5169.10s]  Oh, shit. This is look at how huge this is. Oh, this is so big. New here. Is this the Twitch?
[5169.10s -> 5175.42s]  Okay. Well, the signs aren't helping. Found him. Got you. Fabian. I got you.
[5175.98s -> 5195.37s]  What are you guys doing? Dude, you know, the thing, you know,
[5195.37s -> 5200.76s]  if you ever heard like the phrase, like, don't ever post anything on the internet.
[5200.76s -> 5209.24s]  You ever heard that before? So I had like a cute moment with my girlfriend.
[5209.24s -> 5220.62s]  And it's been it's been ruined forever. I don't have a post anything on the internet,
[5220.62s -> 5227.38s]  but let this be a real lesson for you. What you see on the screen right now should be a warning.
[5227.38s -> 5233.74s]  Don't tell anybody fucking who you are. Don't give him any photos. Don't send anybody a picture.
[5233.74s -> 5238.22s]  Don't ever take a picture. Never take a picture ever again, unless it's on a disposable camera
[5238.22s -> 5240.70s]  and you have the originals. You have the negatives.
[5240.94s -> 5263.77s]  Oh, why? There's so many of these. I wanted to see him kiss the dog again from staff.
[5274.70s -> 5283.98s]  Okay. It's real, by the way. Oh, that's fucking funny. Is it bait? Yeah. No, this is a test.
[5284.54s -> 5297.90s]  Now this is a test. I don't want to fail the test. Like, oh, I want to see him kiss the dog again.
[5297.90s -> 5302.38s]  He's got his finger hovering over the 72 hour suspension.
[5307.86s -> 5319.42s]  The chief was standing up a minute ago. Standing up a minute ago. So what does that mean? Standing
[5319.42s -> 5352.44s]  up a minute ago? Is it flying down? The axe in that one. Oh, you guys really. Why are we airing?
[5352.44s -> 5356.76s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are we airing all? Why are we airing all the grievances of this stream?
[5357.40s -> 5360.52s]  Why are you guys trying to get me to get like in trouble? You guys are just.
[5361.24s -> 5369.05s]  Why are you gaslighting Twitch staff into making me like investigate me? Why? What are you doing?
[5378.70s -> 5383.10s]  Hey, dude, I took two weeks ago. Check the timestamp here. Check that out.
[5383.10s -> 5391.45s]  That serves you right. You're playing hidden folks on board. Hey, you're going to get what?
[5391.45s -> 5410.90s]  You're going to find anything. Hey, don't don't let this chat gaslight you staff.
[5410.90s -> 5420.60s]  What is it? It's fucking lit. Lit Fortnite arms and arms up and down, leaning forward and back.
[5422.47s -> 5427.91s]  What? OK, so you're pulling a log of what everything I told you guys. What did I fucking tell you?
[5428.63s -> 5434.15s]  What did I tell you? I specifically made this use this as an example. Don't ever everything
[5434.15s -> 5439.69s]  you've ever written on this website is logged. All of it. Every single thing you've ever said
[5439.69s -> 5451.67s]  is tied to you. Somebody just pulled that back. That was like four months ago. It's all here.
[5451.67s -> 5459.67s]  Let me be the example for you. Everyone wasn't enough to for scavenger fury max. Wait,
[5459.67s -> 5462.39s]  the sombrero cactus resides somewhere on the outskirts of the desert.
[5462.95s -> 5481.67s]  Who's this? Oh, wait, something going on out here. Help.
[5482.07s -> 5503.13s]  Meet me. Do we help them? What the fuck? It's fucking two hours until this joker's
[5503.13s -> 5512.41s]  dreams. P.S. team all this piss and shit time. Grow up. No, guys, that was that was me quoting
[5512.41s -> 5518.41s]  someone. I didn't say that. That was me saying, hey, look at what this crazy person wrote.
[5519.85s -> 5533.67s]  I didn't say that. I'm not crazy. Not me. Not me. I'm normal. I'm very normal.
[5533.67s -> 5537.56s]  I mean, I'm exceptionally normal. I'll prove it to you right now.
[5543.03s -> 5552.78s]  Hello. How are you? I'm doing very well. You see the Red Sox last night?
[5553.50s -> 5571.13s]  Yeah, they did a very good job. I can't believe they're trading for Ronson Arroyo. Also, I my
[5571.13s -> 5579.54s]  anniversary tonight with my girlfriend should be really fun. I'm gonna go out and maybe
[5579.54s -> 5589.13s]  to dinner. I will, you know, I do very normal things with me and my girlfriend. We just go do
[5589.13s -> 5598.01s]  things. I'll be wearing a suit with a bathing suit underneath just in case. You never know
[5598.01s -> 5602.57s]  when you're going to get invited to go to a pool or go into water. You got to be ready.
[5608.28s -> 5615.10s]  Did Twitch staff just give a hundred community subs? Did Link, the Twitch staffer, oops,
[5615.10s -> 5638.02s]  misclick? Holy shit. Wow. That's a lot of fucking subs. Link, what are you doing? That's insane.
[5647.53s -> 5655.72s]  Link gaming. Dude, Link gaming? No, thank you. Thank you for the hundred community subs,
[5655.72s -> 5663.35s]  which I will take as a free pass to have dog kiss images on my stream. All right, good.
[5669.82s -> 5681.14s]  Free pass granted. No, thank you. Seriously. That's a ton of money. All our hopes are for
[5681.14s -> 5694.89s]  this one plant to grow here in the desert. Don't drown it. I failed the test. Oh, dog kiss pass.
[5697.00s -> 5705.96s]  This lone vulture ate literally everything around him. Everything. Is this a vulture or
[5705.96s -> 5730.28s]  is this every Justin Roiland character? What's going on down here? Wow, funny stuff, dude.
[5730.84s -> 5742.84s]  So where is it? I will tell you that Justin Roiland is so good at doing a loud, high-pitched
[5742.84s -> 5750.74s]  scream. No one will ever be able to do that. No one will ever be able to do that. Like I can't,
[5750.74s -> 5754.50s]  no one can do it. Only he can. No one else can ever do that ever to ever live.
[5758.10s -> 5766.15s]  I can't even try it because it'll be embarrassing because I wouldn't, it wouldn't even be close.
[5766.15s -> 5782.86s]  SOS. The trail ends here. Aladdin surfs the mild winds across the desert like nothing weird is
[5782.86s -> 5798.52s]  happening. Let me send help. Oh, shit. I found you. This is Eric. That would have been so hard to
[5798.52s -> 5811.70s]  find that. Hurry, Max. Glasses. It was the, I'm right here. I can help you. It was only the
[5811.70s -> 5822.31s]  woman's glasses the three vultures didn't eat. All right, I got to find, hold on. I need my help.
[5822.31s -> 5831.93s]  I'm trapped in my bathroom. Start at the beginning of your bathroom and do a false sprint and then
[5831.93s -> 5849.22s]  put shoulder into door. Don't do that. What do you want me to say? Do you have access to a phone?
[5849.22s -> 5857.29s]  No? Can you not like slip like a, like something in the lock on your side to open it? Is the door
[5857.29s -> 5864.18s]  completely lodged? You have no access to anything. Do you have a window in that room? You don't have
[5864.18s -> 5870.01s]  access to the window. There's no window. All right, well, that's weird, okay? So how are you
[5870.01s -> 5874.02s]  going to get out of it? You're going to do that? What do you want me to tell you? Lie on your back.
[5874.02s -> 5878.28s]  If you're in a scenario where you're stuck, it's trapped and you can't get out and there's literally
[5878.28s -> 5882.94s]  no one to help you. Lie on your back and put your knees at a 90 degree angle at the door and just
[5882.94s -> 5889.16s]  like infant toddler tantrum, one, two, three, five, five, sit with both heels into the door until it
[5889.16s -> 5894.62s]  opens. What do you want me to tell you? Why are you asking me for this advice? What do you want me to
[5894.62s -> 5917.54s]  tell you? Is your door made out of wood? Probably. Mega Man Legends 2 looks great. Yeah, that's,
[5917.54s -> 5925.45s]  that boat sailed like an hour ago. I do, I will prove that I own it though. Here it is. I will
[5925.45s -> 5945.06s]  prove, I will prove that I own it. That's the Lord of the Rings. I'll prove that I own it. That's
[5945.06s -> 5953.14s]  like the serial number. Wait, what's this? Oh, there's like a Capcom hint telephone number.
[5953.14s -> 5965.10s]  He's got Lego hair. No, I do not. Not today. Bullshit. Bullshit. Do I? No, I don't actually.
[5965.10s -> 5972.76s]  This is normal human hair. Normal human hair today. This is hair. This is just human hair.
[5972.76s -> 5985.58s]  Now I've, I've made it Lego hair. This is what a normal person looks like. I, this is what a
[5985.58s -> 5990.20s]  normal person looks like. If you saw me on the train. All right. If you saw me on the train,
[5990.20s -> 5993.72s]  if we were on the fucking train together and you saw me like this, what would, you wouldn't do
[5993.72s -> 6008.12s]  anything. Yeah. That's a normal person. He's doing an alien monologue. This must be the
[6008.12s -> 6012.76s]  right Oasis treasure hunter. Open sesame, open sesame, open. Nope. This rocky door needs a
[6012.76s -> 6023.21s]  different kind of magic. I'm going to start wearing like a mustache. I can't grow a mustache.
[6023.21s -> 6027.80s]  So I'm going to start wearing like a fake mustache. All right. We're going to find this.
[6028.60s -> 6035.40s]  We're going to find the vultures. Vultures, vultures, vultures. If I saw you on a train,
[6035.40s -> 6038.94s]  I'd say is that Jerma from JermaCraft? You would not do that.
[6050.33s -> 6061.35s]  It's chats full of vultures. I didn't say that. You did. Would you cringe if someone actually did
[6061.35s -> 6069.99s]  that to you? No, I wouldn't. I would laugh. I'd be like, Oh, that's funny. And then I would get
[6069.99s -> 6073.43s]  off at the next stop. Even if I didn't have to get off at that stop, even if it meant I'd gotten a
[6073.43s -> 6093.72s]  taxi cab for 30 minutes to go to where I was going. What is this? This has been a fun stream.
[6093.72s -> 6097.64s]  This has been like the chat takes over the stream and I kind of, I'm all right with it. I think
[6097.64s -> 6113.66s]  it's fun. It's Lego hair again. That's all right. What? Dead people. This has been a downward
[6113.66s -> 6123.03s]  spiral. I don't think so. I think this has been an upward spiral. Wait, open sesame.
[6125.85s -> 6138.39s]  Martin waits for the music to kick in, but he will dance primarily on the inside.
[6138.39s -> 6146.87s]  No. What about these animals? This bottle of water could save your life in the dunes of the desert.
[6146.87s -> 6152.33s]  Bottle of water. I got to focus on one thing at a time here.
[6152.33s -> 6167.29s]  The chainsaw. This is my first stream of yours. Could you kindly explain what's going on?
[6171.61s -> 6174.82s]  Well, first of all, welcome to the stream. Thanks for joining us.
[6177.35s -> 6181.18s]  This is a game. It's a hidden object game where you have to find, it's like a where's Waldo hidden
[6181.18s -> 6191.99s]  object game. The whole purpose is to find these things. Like for instance, the vulture. That's
[6191.99s -> 6196.97s]  fine. It's just a fun little game. We're just hanging out and just talking about stuff and
[6199.48s -> 6246.23s]  I need to find a bottle of water. All right. Where's this bottle of water? Looking for water.
[6246.23s -> 6254.70s]  Looking for a group of vultures too. What's with the rocks? This is weird rock formation.
[6254.70s -> 6262.84s]  You look like someone hit random in a creative character. Oh, that's a crock of absolute
[6262.84s -> 6280.31s]  bullshit. That's not even remotely accurate. All right. There are many things that I am,
[6280.31s -> 6286.81s]  but one thing I am not is you look like someone hit random on a character creator.
[6286.89s -> 6294.10s]  I am no for a fact that I am not those things. I might not be able to do basic children's math.
[6294.10s -> 6318.81s]  I know that and I've told you that. Mr. Bone, come on. What about down here?
[6318.81s -> 6342.41s]  Too many places to be. Mail preset number three. Oh, please. Fuck. I'm never going to find this
[6342.41s -> 6356.68s]  shit. Who am I looking for? Looking for who you? I'm missing the music. Aladdin searched the mild
[6356.68s -> 6373.83s]  winds across the desert. Hey, no, no, he's right there. Where? What? What? Oh,
[6380.74s -> 6384.74s]  look, I can't see where you're pointing, guys. How many times do I have to tell you the title?
[6394.39s -> 6395.83s]  Says he likes to go be inside.
[6405.27s -> 6416.76s]  Martin. No, he's not here. He's not even over here. That person is.
[6421.69s -> 6423.85s]  All right, let's go. We need to find where people are dancing.
[6426.15s -> 6431.54s]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's not what I need. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,
[6431.54s -> 6435.69s]  let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, how do you guys like to be referred to?
[6436.95s -> 6446.52s]  Ladies and gentlemen. Hey, you guys. Hey, chat. What would you prefer? Folks. Hey, folks.
[6459.58s -> 6464.06s]  The germs, the germaniacs. No, that's not what this that's not what you guys are called.
[6466.47s -> 6469.03s]  We have gone over this many times. You guys are the germamites.
[6469.67s -> 6487.14s]  Anybody see water? No, not the rats. You are the germamite, the germamites. Yeah,
[6487.14s -> 6492.10s]  to say it like that. Otherwise, it's not accurate. It's the the accent there.
[6496.78s -> 6502.30s]  No links resident sleeper. Are you sure? That's I see a lot of them. Oh, here we go. What's down
[6502.30s -> 6519.37s]  here? Martin waits for the music. Martin waits for the music. Martin looking for the music.
[6519.37s -> 6552.49s]  Martin music. Wait, yeah. Oh, Rick. Oh, Rick. What? What? We made that reference before. I wasn't.
[6554.25s -> 6557.37s]  That's the original image. Why are you linking the original image?
[6557.37s -> 6564.42s]  Instant minus two for saying Rick. I wouldn't even I wouldn't even do an impression.
[6564.42s -> 6570.90s]  Instant instant just reaction when they Rick and Morty down vote. I didn't do anything. OK,
[6571.06s -> 6578.66s]  I'm doing it again. I've said it again. I got to stop saying the word that show. What? What? Why
[6578.66s -> 6587.27s]  are we so fucking crazy about that show? It's like it's ear poison. If you hear that word.
[6587.27s -> 6601.88s]  Why? It's all right. It's I mean, whatever you do. You guys don't care that much, do you? Yes,
[6601.88s -> 6610.34s]  we do. What's your favorite TV show? What's your favorite TV show? Current TV show that's currently
[6610.34s -> 6624.86s]  on the air. Fear factor. That's not even on the air. The NBA. I mean, that's called the NBA school.
[6624.86s -> 6640.25s]  Roe Jack Horseman. OK. Better Call Saul. It's a good one. Power Rangers.
[6640.25s -> 6647.08s]  America's Funniest Home Videos. Always Sunny Philadelphia. That's a great one. Here we go.
[6647.08s -> 6653.98s]  We made it to the festival. How come I'm not? I am disgusted. I am absolutely revolted that I'm not
[6653.98s -> 6659.62s]  seeing any Curb Your Enthusiasm fans here. I'm disgusted by this. I'm fucking actually disgusted.
[6659.62s -> 6677.78s]  I think one person said it. Curb is for boomers. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm revolted right
[6677.78s -> 6685.91s]  now. I got to go brush my teeth after hearing that. OK, we need to find the person that
[6686.39s -> 6708.84s]  music only likes to dance inside dancing inside. Where are you? Oh, oh, I turned the music on.
[6712.38s -> 6714.94s]  All right. Everybody dance. There's there's the only dances on the inside.
[6716.86s -> 6729.70s]  How many more do I need to move? One more. And it's one of these hard ones.
[6730.50s -> 6739.40s]  This reptile is a narcissist. What's this image? Narcissist, narcissist, narcissist, narcissist,
[6739.40s -> 6748.15s]  narcissist. This one's good. I like this one. I'll show this one. This one's actually really
[6748.15s -> 6757.83s]  this one's this one's pretty good. It is. Can you imagine like walking into the bathroom and seeing
[6757.83s -> 6787.59s]  this public restroom album cover? He's an egomaniac. This reptile is in this cactus
[6787.59s -> 6793.11s]  forest is so well camouflaged often loses itself. It's extremely rare. Whiteback scorpion is
[6793.11s -> 6800.12s]  surrounded by its children. A king of the desert never goes underground. All right. King of the
[6800.12s -> 6813.02s]  desert never goes underground. Well, I found the snake. How is that not the snake looking for a
[6813.02s -> 6833.42s]  bunch of scorpions? There are no more people left. Scorpions, tons of them. We want face cam. Oh,
[6833.42s -> 6852.98s]  OK. Thanks for the feedback. Appreciate the feedback. Scammed out of a wink. Let me just make
[6852.98s -> 6866.31s]  sure. Oh, fuck. Yeah, I did scam you. Hold on. All right. I need either a snake or I need the
[6866.31s -> 6876.31s]  scorpions or a bottle of water or a reptile in a cactus place. Bottle of water, cactus forest,
[6882.63s -> 6892.10s]  cactus forest, cactus forest, cactus forest. No, what a handsome young man I am. Hey, thanks.
[6898.26s -> 6906.92s]  I don't even know what this is. What is this image? This is like a bunch of dots, like three
[6906.92s -> 6916.38s]  mapping of me. I don't know what that is. I don't want to. Why does every one of your winks look
[6916.38s -> 6923.96s]  like you're trying to get something out of your eye? Because I am trying to get something out of
[6923.96s -> 6934.46s]  my eye. I'm trying to get a wink over with so I can go back to doing a live stream. Remember,
[6934.46s -> 6945.30s]  those are codes. He hates us. No, I already told you how I feel about the winks now because I
[6945.30s -> 6956.42s]  thought it was funny for one day and it's been two months and I have to stay. I can't walk it back.
[6956.42s -> 6961.66s]  I'm not going to walk it back. I never said I was going to walk it back. Increase the wink
[6961.66s -> 6974.97s]  price. No, no, no, I can't. It's too late. Come on, where are these scorpions? I need to find one
[6974.97s -> 6994.78s]  more damn thing. Would you be mad if I made winks 200,000? But I kept 75,000 and 75,000 was
[6996.73s -> 7013.51s]  my channel points. I say shpee. No, I don't want to do that. That's worse than winking.
[7015.29s -> 7020.49s]  Imagine how often I would be doing that. You guys watch a lot and there's people that have a lot of
[7020.49s -> 7033.53s]  points. I didn't even think about it. Oh, wait, I got it. Mom's waiting for the bus to the big
[7033.53s -> 7044.57s]  city to buy some diapers. Yes, mom. Okay, the TV technician is fine tuning a signal.
[7051.75s -> 7059.85s]  TV, TV tech, TV tech. There you are. Move it out of the way, please.
[7060.49s -> 7073.11s]  Hello. Where's my wink? Well, you know what I'm going to do? I know it's 7,000 IQ play here.
[7073.11s -> 7086.02s]  Soon, winks are going to be 75% off for one day only. And then it's going away.

[7131.34s -> 7140.18s]  bone in some wall. Freaky stuff. Let's go. Winks are going to crash. You need to sell them now.
[7140.18s -> 7147.90s]  Please don't. No, your wink. Don't you understand? Your winks are worth a lot now and you're selling
[7147.90s -> 7159.35s]  them because you know that winks are going to be really, really inexpensive in like a month.
[7159.35s -> 7168.87s]  That's insider wink trading. Oh man. Why did I just fucking say that? That was, why did I say this?
