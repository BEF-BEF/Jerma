[17.08s -> 25.06s]  How's it going? What is happening? How are you? What kind of tea do I got?
[26.30s -> 35.91s]  Uh, black tea today, actually. I said I don't drink black tea, but I really want the caffeine today.
[42.51s -> 47.67s]  And it's black tea with nothing in it, which is the worst kind of black tea.
[52.31s -> 56.11s]  Black tea with nothing in it just kind of tastes like water with.
[57.46s -> 62.58s]  Okay. Do you know, you don't like it like a seltzer water.
[63.90s -> 69.90s]  Seltzer water just has that it's water with a little bit of flavor, just a little bit.
[69.90s -> 76.22s]  It's a black tea is just kind of dry water with a hint of something kind of bitter.
[76.86s -> 83.15s]  I normally would put honey or sugar in it, but not today. I don't really have any.
[83.87s -> 96.02s]  All right. Let me, let me tweet and we'll go. Give me one second.
[96.02s -> 136.27s]  All right. Let me get comfortable this out of the way today. We're going to play a world box.
[136.83s -> 141.04s]  This was in the recommended channel. Looks pretty fun.
[141.84s -> 146.46s]  It's a game where you just kind of control everything.
[147.49s -> 151.65s]  I guess you watch civilizations kind of come and go.
[152.45s -> 159.01s]  The God game seems kind of fun. I've heard it's very, very interesting.
[163.71s -> 168.78s]  They just had an update, I think. Uh, it looks like a day or two ago today.
[168.78s -> 173.49s]  Maybe I don't even know. God complex Andy.
[174.29s -> 180.22s]  Hey, are you drinking hot Dr. Pepper?
[182.74s -> 196.38s]  I feel like that would not be as bad as I think it is. It's bad.
[197.18s -> 203.49s]  If you okay, if you took 70% of the sugar. Oh, fuck. Hold on. I got to restart the game.
[204.21s -> 211.90s]  Hold on a second. I've been idling here for like 20 minutes. Hold on. I gotta restart.
[217.73s -> 220.53s]  If you took like 70% of the sugar out of Dr. Pepper,
[221.41s -> 223.49s]  I feel like it would not even be bad hot.
[227.04s -> 235.31s]  Although I have no idea. It could be awful. Let me reopen it.
[236.85s -> 241.76s]  All right. Is this a randomly generated? I think it is.
[244.29s -> 250.10s]  There we go. Okay. Move back over here and come on.
[250.74s -> 257.34s]  Hey, there it is. Turn the volume on. There's no sound or anything yet.
[257.34s -> 265.68s]  All right. So this is, this is it. This is world box. I'm very ready.
[265.68s -> 272.50s]  Tutorial bear. Let me just take a nice sip of my tea.
[278.27s -> 281.52s]  Hi there. I'm tutorial bear. Take a moment and hear me out.
[281.52s -> 285.28s]  Super world box is a game about creation and destruction.
[285.28s -> 292.61s]  Control is simple. W A S D arrow mouse. There's a lot of info. Hold on.
[292.61s -> 301.36s]  W A S D arrow keys to move the camera. Right. Q and E to control zoom.
[301.36s -> 305.90s]  One, two, three, four, five to select powers and then escape quits the game.
[305.90s -> 309.92s]  I'm going to accidentally press that. It's literally only four. Yeah.
[309.92s -> 317.18s]  But it was just like, all right. So it's Q E W A S D. I got it.
[317.18s -> 320.62s]  All your powers are the bottom panel. Here are some important buttons.
[320.62s -> 326.34s]  The save button. Use it to save and load your worlds.
[326.34s -> 329.50s]  Custom worlds. Create worlds with bigger size.
[329.50s -> 333.98s]  World laws. Customize rules for your world.
[337.10s -> 339.98s]  Drawing. Tools to create your world so you can make your own world.
[339.98s -> 345.23s]  Oh, this is like a dragon or something. Change brush size for some powers.
[345.23s -> 351.81s]  This button will be on the left. Civilizations. Use it to create villages
[351.81s -> 355.22s]  and mess with kingdoms. Creatures and monsters.
[355.22s -> 358.00s]  Looking for dragons. That's the place. All right.
[358.00s -> 361.12s]  Nature and disasters. There's also some tools to help your civilization.
[362.13s -> 365.89s]  Destruction. Here you can find bombs and nukes.
[365.89s -> 371.65s]  Okay. And other various powers and menus.
[371.65s -> 375.20s]  There's so much stuff in there. Try them out and experiment.
[375.20s -> 384.94s]  Enjoy the game. Oh, shit. Okay. What do I do?
[384.94s -> 403.90s]  I just wiped out the only fire. Oops. Can I restart?
[410.26s -> 413.14s]  Don't give me this power in the first five seconds of the game.
[413.14s -> 416.34s]  All right. Create your world. All right. I'm making my own world.
[416.34s -> 427.14s]  I'm deleting all this. Oh, my goodness. You didn't save it.
[427.14s -> 432.86s]  It doesn't matter. All right. How do I make a new world?
[432.86s -> 437.36s]  Create new world. Here it is. All right. Choose the size and select a template.
[437.36s -> 448.22s]  Continent. Oh, shit. Okay. Hold on. So these are the resources.
[448.96s -> 453.76s]  So I think, do people just live? Animals start to spawn? What is this?
[455.62s -> 460.02s]  A bee. It shows how many kills it has. What the fuck?
[460.02s -> 466.16s]  All right. Hold on. This is the Fortnite map. Wait. Let me look at it again.
[466.16s -> 472.50s]  Continent. One big landmass. Box world. Islands. Boring planes.
[472.50s -> 476.88s]  Donut. Toast. Pancake. I think we'll start with this.
[476.88s -> 483.34s]  We'll just start with... I gotta figure out how to play.
[483.34s -> 490.82s]  Cool. So let's see. All right. How do I get people?
[490.82s -> 496.37s]  Civilizations, kingdoms, and villages. Okay. Kings and leaders.
[497.18s -> 511.36s]  See the location. Oh, we got trees. Oh, humans. Basic human with basic needs.
[511.36s -> 514.16s]  Where should I put them? Will they just start a civilization?
[520.64s -> 524.94s]  All right. So what do they do? All right. Good luck.
[526.77s -> 529.65s]  All right. We're going to spawn an alligator. Oh, wait. They're starting.
[537.07s -> 543.60s]  Wait. They're going to kill it? Now he's like a... What is this structure?
[547.15s -> 552.85s]  The only two humans on earth. I guess the one... Uh-oh. They're retreating.
[552.85s -> 559.06s]  Oh, no. Oh. Fucking assholes. Nuke them.
[559.06s -> 563.94s]  Okay. Humans? Elves? All right. Let's do like...
[565.38s -> 569.22s]  How many humans should we do? All right. All right. All right. All right.
[569.22s -> 574.05s]  Let's do... I got like... What? Okay. Should I put elves somewhere?
[574.05s -> 580.93s]  What about orcs? All right. Dwarves. Will they be friends?
[580.93s -> 584.19s]  Didn't I play this already? I did not. All right. So they made a fire.
[584.19s -> 586.43s]  They're making like a house or something. There's a mine here.
[586.43s -> 598.58s]  All right. Let's put the dwarves over here. All right. So there's 10 dwarves.
[598.58s -> 603.25s]  New kingdom. Wait. They made a new kingdom.
[603.25s -> 616.66s]  Okay. Let's put animals here too. Hold on. I'm just... I gotta populate the world.
[622.43s -> 631.41s]  Turtles and shit. Okay. Cool. Make a frog kingdom.
[631.41s -> 633.73s]  Uh... All right. We'll put the frogs down here.
[633.73s -> 644.85s]  I'm not fucking up the whole ecosystem, right?
[644.85s -> 657.58s]  Piranha? Rhinos? What is this? Oh, this is the king.
[657.58s -> 678.99s]  This is the king of the dwarves. So I think they just... Do they have children?
[678.99s -> 685.71s]  View kingdom. There's 10 people in Gursul. They have one village.
[690.54s -> 696.69s]  They're researching. Okay. This is just gonna end up... Did they fight?
[696.69s -> 705.34s]  Will they become friends? All right. Hold on. What about the sponge? Vortex?
[705.34s -> 711.46s]  Shovel? Wait. I can make mountains.
[711.46s -> 715.31s]  Shallow water. All right. I'm gonna make a mountain range over by the dwarves.
[715.31s -> 730.24s]  Oh, they already have mountains. Oops. Oopsie.
[730.24s -> 736.93s]  What do you mean you've ruined it? No. They live in the mountains.
[736.93s -> 741.07s]  Oh, wait. I think they are having children. All right. 10 versus...
[741.07s -> 744.06s]  No. I have to make it even. I'm gonna make it even.
[744.06s -> 755.14s]  Three more, right? I'm gonna put rhinos up here too.
[755.14s -> 763.74s]  Oh, we'll put rhino island. Nature? Temperature? Oh, I'm making it hot.
[763.74s -> 768.50s]  No, no, no. I don't want to do that. Make rat island?
[768.50s -> 777.86s]  Okay. Can they build structures? That would be actually pretty funny if they could.
[777.86s -> 781.14s]  The humans are developing a lot faster than the dwarves are.
[781.14s -> 789.44s]  What's going on here? Their favorite food is sushi.
[789.44s -> 798.18s]  The dwarves' favorite food is sushi. What? What are the humans' favorite food?
[798.18s -> 803.92s]  What is this? Cider. Okay. What traits?
[803.92s -> 811.20s]  Peaceful. Never attacks first. They have individual names. Okay.
[811.20s -> 820.19s]  Oh, yes. The dwarves love sushi. The dwarves are probably eating raw meat.
[820.19s -> 828.27s]  What are you doing? Oh, I guess they have different preferences. Never mind.
[828.27s -> 834.93s]  Stop poking me. Okay. All right. Let's make some more kings and leaders.
[834.93s -> 844.38s]  Yeah. Who? They show up on the map. Show... Wait. Armies? Enemies? Boats?
[844.38s -> 854.72s]  What? 12. Wait. Okay. So the humans are developing faster than the dwarves
[854.72s -> 858.80s]  with the, you know, civilization. But the dwarves are...
[858.80s -> 867.71s]  They're having more children faster. Okay. Let's add some more.
[867.71s -> 872.48s]  Uh-oh. Oh, should I leave it? Should I just see what happens?
[872.48s -> 881.41s]  The dwarves are having way more sex than the humans. Coffee?
[881.41s -> 887.47s]  Bless creatures to make them stronger. Madness?
[887.47s -> 894.08s]  Divine light. Oh, my God. Oh, wait, wait, hold on. The humans are catching up.
[894.08s -> 901.49s]  The dwarves have... They're currently mastering the navy.
[901.49s -> 908.74s]  Wait a minute. Where are they going? What is this thing?
[908.74s -> 917.95s]  There's nobody even on this boat. Why were they... They couldn't just... They
[917.95s -> 924.16s]  couldn't walk this way? It's a fishing boat. Okay. They're
[924.16s -> 936.59s]  keeping up. Should we add another kingdom? Yes. Okay.
[936.59s -> 943.62s]  Um, what should we do? Orcs? Or elves? All right. Orcs.
[943.62s -> 949.92s]  Where's it gonna be the orc? Okay, the orcs are gonna be up here. Yeah, like here.
[949.92s -> 957.14s]  Okay, they're already attacked. How many do I need? Ten?
[957.14s -> 975.74s]  All right. That's good. Okay, there are 13. The orcs are OP.
[975.74s -> 988.62s]  Save this. Statistics. 15 years. It's taken 15 years and it's only... You only
[988.62s -> 993.20s]  could... Okay. Infected? Natural death?
[993.20s -> 1000.02s]  Death from hunger? Creatures eaten? New village has been founded.
[1000.02s -> 1003.78s]  New kingdom has been founded. Okay, the orcs are progressing rapidly.
[1003.78s -> 1020.46s]  All right, they're doing well. All right, we got to put the elves down here too
[1020.46s -> 1022.06s]  then. All right, should the elves be on like a little
[1022.06s -> 1028.48s]  island or something? No, they'll be down here. Far away. Far
[1028.48s -> 1033.01s]  away. And the elves have been around for centuries, so there's gonna be like 20
[1033.01s -> 1043.34s]  of them already. Oh wait, this is the frog kingdom!
[1043.34s -> 1047.86s]  Oh shit. I may have just caused a problem. That's okay, right?
[1047.86s -> 1061.25s]  What the hell is this? I didn't make this a giggly?
[1061.25s -> 1071.78s]  Okay, well, they'll be all right. So we have the... Wait, what's this?
[1071.78s -> 1080.58s]  Is this a different... Who is this? Is this an orc?
[1080.58s -> 1086.85s]  So wait, this one guy made his own kingdom.
[1086.85s -> 1095.92s]  This guy's fucked. Okay, well, good luck. Wait a minute. No, it's got two now. All
[1095.92s -> 1103.22s]  right, let's just see what happens. This is interesting to me. All right,
[1103.22s -> 1115.41s]  they're doing a little... They're expanding. Uh-oh. Okay, we already got this. Now I
[1115.41s -> 1122.32s]  need to... All right, let's let's add some stuff.
[1122.32s -> 1127.31s]  Let's bless the elves. No, they have plenty of frogs.
[1127.31s -> 1131.50s]  I'm gonna... Okay, I'm gonna bless this kingdom with chickens.
[1131.50s -> 1138.46s]  I don't know if that does anything. I don't know if that matters, but whatever. I
[1138.46s -> 1149.84s]  think there's gonna be conflict here. Bless them with rain. Rain. All right,
[1149.84s -> 1152.72s]  who's... Who do we bless with rain? These are the
[1152.72s -> 1173.52s]  underdogs. Here, I grant you rain. There you go. And candy.
[1173.52s -> 1181.98s]  Click show kingdom zones in the civilization menu.
[1181.98s -> 1190.06s]  Interesting. This is like a game of risk. Funny, okay.
[1190.06s -> 1208.82s]  So how do they own this much land? Click on the boats.
[1208.82s -> 1215.89s]  Um, I don't know what these boats are doing. Uh, humans,
[1215.89s -> 1221.63s]  should I bless... All right, we'll bless them again with
[1221.63s -> 1229.81s]  uh, enchanted seeds. No, that's cheating. How about let's bless them with an
[1229.81s -> 1237.81s]  earthquake. Acid. You're progressing too quickly.
[1237.81s -> 1251.44s]  It's time for you to have to deal with some acid. Plain soil.
[1251.44s -> 1261.57s]  It's... They've slowed down. Favorite food. Burgers.
[1261.57s -> 1279.09s]  Children zero. Children four, okay. Likes bread. Children eight. Holy shit.
[1279.09s -> 1284.03s]  You are responsible for a major percentage of everybody here.
[1284.03s -> 1302.30s]  What about you? Zero. Ten. There's two people here that are
[1302.30s -> 1307.65s]  responsible for half of the village. All of these...
[1307.65s -> 1314.69s]  They're currently in there now. Okay. Where are you going?
[1314.69s -> 1321.10s]  They're expanding. What's this? What's going on? What's this? What are they doing?
[1321.10s -> 1327.18s]  What is this? What's this banner? Wait, they have shields.
[1327.18s -> 1338.11s]  Uh-oh. They're getting ready for war already?
[1338.11s -> 1348.50s]  With who? War has already been declared. Should I slow them down?
[1348.50s -> 1358.22s]  I'm gonna slow them down. What the fuck was that?
[1358.22s -> 1365.36s]  I didn't do that. What's happening? Where is that happening?
[1365.36s -> 1381.07s]  I'm not doing that. Wait, are they fighting? Oh shit!
[1381.07s -> 1385.82s]  No, it's... Oh, let me bless them. That's unfair.
[1385.82s -> 1398.88s]  That's not fair. They just got... They get lightning striked?
[1398.88s -> 1408.35s]  You good? Everything's good to go? Random lightning strikes?
[1408.35s -> 1412.45s]  Give them money. Yeah, their kingdom kind of sucks.
[1412.45s -> 1423.65s]  Sponges. Copies pixels under it to others around it.
[1423.65s -> 1434.22s]  Pickaxe. Removes grass. Shows where... Oh, shows where armies are going.
[1434.22s -> 1437.74s]  Shows where armies are going to attack when...
[1437.74s -> 1444.99s]  Some other god hates these elves. Okay, so it's showing where they're gonna
[1444.99s -> 1455.66s]  attack. I think, wait, people are dying in the
[1455.66s -> 1460.67s]  in the elf camp. I definitely want to see where they're
[1460.67s -> 1473.07s]  going. What happened here? This kingdom is
[1473.07s -> 1479.90s]  disintegrating. The one guy kingdom. 24 versus 13.
[1479.90s -> 1489.74s]  Wait, they're all defecting over here. Why are they all defecting?
[1489.74s -> 1512.24s]  Is it because this area is just fucked up? Because it's lava. I can change that.
[1512.32s -> 1541.70s]  There. And make some cool water. Nice ice cold water. Oh, another human
[1541.70s -> 1551.04s]  kingdom over here. It's because you gave them a chicken.
[1551.04s -> 1556.13s]  What, it created a whole civilization? What about... Wait, where are those
[1556.13s -> 1560.30s]  frogs? Did they eat all the frogs or something?
[1560.30s -> 1562.14s]  Wait, how can I see where all the animals are?
[1562.14s -> 1570.88s]  Statistics about your world. A hundred deaths?
[1570.88s -> 1578.91s]  What? No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is not... I'm not gonna let this...
[1578.91s -> 1587.34s]  I'm not gonna let this slide. I'm sorry.
[1587.34s -> 1600.21s]  Get out of here. That's too much expansion. No, I'm sorry. That's not... I'm sorry.
[1600.21s -> 1612.26s]  You don't... That's too much expansion. Candy? Create the candy biome.
[1612.26s -> 1616.74s]  Should I just make candy island over here? Okay, I'm gonna make candy island over here.
[1616.74s -> 1627.09s]  Oh, wait, should I just put a bunch of candy... Wait, okay. So this
[1627.09s -> 1634.56s]  candy over here. Corrupted seeds. Mushroom seeds. Grass seeds.
[1634.56s -> 1642.93s]  Let's make them fight for this island. I mean, it already was grass, but let's make
[1642.93s -> 1655.90s]  it really, really just like nice and lush.
[1655.98s -> 1661.30s]  They're persevering.
[1667.28s -> 1673.60s]  Is the orc actually gonna be able to kill the bear? No.
[1673.60s -> 1678.40s]  Oh, wait a minute. This is probably a bad idea. Oh,
[1678.40s -> 1686.19s]  all right. Get rid of this. This is enough of this. I just want to make it a
[1686.19s -> 1691.86s]  little harder for them. Cad Till has become the biggest kingdom
[1691.86s -> 1695.81s]  and the one guy kingdom. Wait, where's the actual one guy? How many kids do you
[1695.81s -> 1711.98s]  have? 39? Holy shit, dude. Every...
[1711.98s -> 1720.75s]  Wait, that's kind of fucked up. Doesn't that imply
[1720.75s -> 1725.10s]  that... Wait, how is it possible that you've had 38
[1725.10s -> 1738.21s]  children and there's 38 people here? I don't know. I think I have to get a
[1738.21s -> 1745.14s]  tornado. From the other kingdom? Uh-oh, we're gonna
[1745.14s -> 1753.86s]  fight here. Are they gonna go for it? Are they going for it? The orcs
[1753.86s -> 1760.29s]  over here are scattered. They're not preparing.
[1760.29s -> 1770.59s]  No, they back down. Wait, where they... Where they going?
[1770.59s -> 1779.33s]  Uh-oh, they're getting an army ready over here too.
[1779.33s -> 1794.24s]  Dude, what's with all the lightning? They're kind of just hanging out.
[1794.24s -> 1802.82s]  Oh, all right. Check this out. Let's make this whole thing fucking awful.
[1802.82s -> 1810.03s]  Fruit bushes right in the middle. Good luck. Fight over the bushes.
[1810.03s -> 1824.98s]  Amuse me. Fight over these fruit bushes. Amuse me.
[1824.98s -> 1833.79s]  Come on, you're just gonna... Uh-oh, a deco... Wait, what is this person doing?
[1833.79s -> 1843.52s]  They... Oh, now that they're part of this place.
[1843.52s -> 1856.53s]  38 children. Is that even... Like, I feel like at some point it's just 236%
[1856.53s -> 1869.76s]  full hunger that's gonna get ugly over here. Who's got the biggest kingdom?
[1869.76s -> 1888.18s]  77. They've been very busy. Villages? Cultures? Force kingdom to start a war.
[1888.18s -> 1892.85s]  When used on a village, that's not a capital. It becomes its own kingdom.
[1892.85s -> 1899.95s]  All right, I'm curious about this. Let's take a look. 11 houses, 16 people in the
[1899.95s -> 1910.35s]  army. 27... How did... Who died? Okay, so this is the leader of this village.
[1910.35s -> 1926.96s]  They have no children. They get in boats. Oh, he got killed by a bear. That's right.
[1926.96s -> 1943.98s]  No battles. Okay. Still no fight yet. What about a dog? You guys... Who should get the
[1943.98s -> 1961.79s]  dogs? You can all have... Okay, you can all have three dogs. Weird building pattern.
[1961.79s -> 1976.11s]  They kind of came back strong though. You guys... Let's put a few... A couple of cows.
[1983.04s -> 1994.21s]  Um... Wait, I can make enemies? All right, who should deal with the first... Who should deal
[1994.21s -> 2005.73s]  with the first group of, uh, like, attacking bandits? Oh my god, there's so much more that
[2005.73s -> 2021.46s]  I didn't see. A dragon? UFO? Beehive? Make Monster Island. All right, hold on. First,
[2021.46s -> 2027.07s]  I'm gonna make... We need to make somebody... A village has to get attacked by bandits.
[2027.07s -> 2041.17s]  Make Dragon Island. This thing is scary. All right, who is the most progressed?
[2041.17s -> 2058.43s]  It's either... You... You... You Boredran? E.S. or Ostod? Who needs a challenge here? E.S.?
[2058.43s -> 2066.37s]  I can check. Yeah, let's... Let's see who could use a challenge. Statistics. What about your world?
[2066.37s -> 2075.65s]  Oh, no. World laws? Kingdoms can declare wars and treaties. Yeah. Cities can rebel when
[2075.65s -> 2080.98s]  have low loyalty. So that's what we've seen. Kingdoms will send settlers to establish new
[2081.06s -> 2089.65s]  villages. They have armies. Allows the stealing of borders. Babies will be born. Everyone needs
[2089.65s -> 2095.36s]  food to live and creatures can die of old age. Baby animals can be born. Animals can randomly spawn.
[2095.36s -> 2120.50s]  Okay. So... World history. Demons from another realm have invaded this world. What? Since when?
[2120.50s -> 2135.46s]  Uh-oh. I didn't have to do anything. This thing has almost six... It's six hundred health? All
[2135.46s -> 2140.16s]  right, let's see. Here you go. You guys can have, like, a bunch of chickens and, like, two cows.
[2140.64s -> 2162.11s]  And let's, like, bless them with water. Here. Have some, like, grass seeds. This... They're looking
[2162.11s -> 2173.31s]  at each other from over... Okay. So now they can start their entire kingdom over here. They're
[2173.31s -> 2185.26s]  already doing machinery. Ah! What's going on here? Nobody in it. Is this a... Is this a diplomatic
[2185.26s -> 2203.46s]  ambassador of the Demon Kingdom? I don't know. Stone? Uh, let's put some... Actually, you know what?
[2203.46s -> 2213.02s]  Let's put some stone up here. I feel like they need it. They definitely need it. I just killed,
[2213.02s -> 2234.85s]  like, three people. Oops. Fill the hole up here. Now mine this for resources. Plants? All right.
[2234.85s -> 2256.32s]  Let's do some plants over here. Lemon seeds on the top of the mountain. Getting close to each other.
[2256.32s -> 2271.76s]  Hourglass? Change the flow of... Ah! What happened? Baby tornado? What's going on? Why are we all
[2271.76s -> 2290.43s]  celebrating? What happened? What are we celebrating? The King Oz of Zagad is dead. Oh, I crushed him
[2290.43s -> 2306.94s]  with a rock. Zoom out? Oh. Why is there a tornado kingdom? And why would the whole world celebrate
[2306.94s -> 2324.26s]  a tornado? Oh, right. Uh-oh. Okay. Favorite units? Oh, I should have favorited the guy that had like
[2324.26s -> 2333.86s]  40 kids. Can you handle that? I think they have the biggest army.
[2342.16s -> 2352.19s]  I'm picking favorites here, but it's all right. I'm gonna give it to everybody. Don't worry.
[2352.83s -> 2376.90s]  What are you doing? Favorite food? Cider. Mood normal. Children 16. Is this like, um,
[2376.90s -> 2395.90s]  can you put more plants? I mean, more plants, you think? Should we make it? Let's, let's,
[2395.90s -> 2403.79s]  let's heat something up. When do they start killing each other? I don't know. I would imagine
[2403.79s -> 2413.33s]  probably soon. There's not much, there's no more, there's nowhere else to go. Okay. Let's put some,
[2413.33s -> 2424.21s]  uh, oh, a hot spring. Volcano. Snow! Okay. Let's, let's, let's make some snow. This would be nice.
[2424.69s -> 2454.14s]  Give him like a winter wonderland. I hear hitting. What's being hit? Oh, they're killing a sheep.
[2462.80s -> 2474.70s]  All right. Should I drop a, uh, I don't want to drop on it. A heat ray. Robot Santa? Oh,
[2474.70s -> 2479.86s]  what about fireworks? Okay. Let's do, let's celebrate the fact that we just had another
[2479.86s -> 2514.58s]  30 kids. Am I going to light them? What happened? The size is too big. That's all right. I can fix
[2514.58s -> 2524.67s]  it. All right. That's, that's my apology. I gave you like six chickens. There's some cooled water.
[2528.77s -> 2542.34s]  It's time for war. This gag pond has 40. Oh, they're all here. All right. It looks,
[2542.34s -> 2548.51s]  I can influence this. Here it comes. I'm thinking about throwing a fireball at some point. Lava.
[2548.51s -> 2585.14s]  No. Um, they're getting very close. There's a lot of play out. Poison the water. Uh, they're just
[2585.14s -> 2595.78s]  matching each other's speed. Nobody wants to make the first move. They're all peaceful with each
[2595.78s -> 2616.53s]  other. 45 deaths from hunger. Other deaths. Are they still over there? It's like two. I picked them
[2616.53s -> 2632.53s]  up. Burning feet, fire, blood, fireproof. Cool. Um, all right. I think this is as big as the world
[2632.53s -> 2638.14s]  is going to be able to get. Cause I mean, we have so many kingdoms here. It's time to start a little
[2638.14s -> 2650.29s]  bit of conflict. What do you think? Like I'm just, okay. I'm just going to put a grenade over here
[2650.29s -> 2669.65s]  and it's going to be like, what the hell was that? Right? It's like, what was that? Oh,
[2669.65s -> 2685.70s]  they're just sitting at the border. Okay. We could make it be, we could speed the time up a
[2685.70s -> 2696.93s]  little bit here and see what happens in like a hundred years. Increased. What was it? Times one.
[2696.93s -> 2707.62s]  Okay. I could do times two maybe, right? Oh man. All right. What do you, what should I do? Times
[2707.62s -> 2726.72s]  five. What does the world look like? Uh, yeah, this is happening now. This is definitely happening.
[2726.72s -> 2736.51s]  No, fuck you. No, fuck you. No, fuck you. Well, how big is their army?
[2736.51s -> 2741.23s]  Attack speed. I don't know who's going to, who's going to hit first. You just drank coffee.
[2741.23s -> 2761.30s]  Here we go. Here we go. They're getting too close. There it goes. Oh no. They're fighting over,
[2762.83s -> 2776.42s]  they're attacking their huts. Just freak them out a little. I am angry. Stop fighting. Holy shit.
[2776.42s -> 2791.02s]  They wiped them out. They wiped them out completely. Nobody even died here. The one guy kingdom
[2791.02s -> 2807.49s]  is now very strong. Absolutely wiped them out. That's bad for you. Let us bet next time. Well,
[2807.49s -> 2816.54s]  how about this? Why don't you bet on who reigns completely supreme here? You got, um,
[2817.82s -> 2822.51s]  I think the dwarves have been wiped out. No, they're not. The dwarves are here. You've got,
[2822.51s -> 2829.65s]  I don't know. Should we go by kingdom or just humans, dwarves, orcs, or I don't know. But I'm
[2829.65s -> 2835.65s]  going to be influenced. This is killing a lot of people. All right. Don't vote for these people
[2835.65s -> 2841.95s]  because the tornado just went through the whole village and I think took out a lot of people.
[2841.95s -> 2866.37s]  Oh man. Are they all right? All right. I'm glad I tested that over there because eventually,
[2867.09s -> 2878.22s]  oh, God's just testing. Um, like this is still going. Just, I want them to make sure they know
[2878.22s -> 2893.73s]  what they're dealing with. This little tornado is causing so many problems. All right. It's,
[2893.73s -> 2920.48s]  we're at, we're at halftime. Everybody gets a dozen chickens. Why is nobody going to Candy
[2920.48s -> 2937.06s]  Island? It looks like, okay, we can speed up time a little bit now. Relations. These diplomatic
[2937.06s -> 2954.43s]  relations with other kingdoms. Death is health. They're militarist. Damn. Okay. War is peace.
[2954.43s -> 2961.49s]  Okay. They're at peace with pretty much everybody besides, I'm not worried with anybody. They
[2961.49s -> 2970.69s]  already destroyed everybody. Where are you guys? They're currently at peace over here too. Culture
[2970.69s -> 2988.24s]  level. How many villages this has? Peaceful militarist. Click the light bulb. Research.
[2990.85s -> 3003.78s]  Common knowledge is windmill population. Okay. Move over here. All right. Nobody else is at war.
[3003.78s -> 3026.91s]  We can change that really quickly though. I thought they weren't at war. They're gonna. All
[3026.91s -> 3035.22s]  right. I, we got to slow them down. I'm actually going to slow them down a little and then great
[3035.22s -> 3047.50s]  heat. What are they doing? Did you guys already, uh, do a poll? I don't remember. What are they
[3047.50s -> 3066.94s]  doing over here? What's going on here? Why are they all hanging around the windmill? All right.
[3066.94s -> 3098.67s]  Let's speed it up. Times five. Nobody decided to go over to the islands. What was going on over here?
[3098.67s -> 3120.45s]  Gold mine. Change the laws of the world now. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Natural disasters,
[3120.45s -> 3125.18s]  other disasters. Minerals. We need to start some fights. Look at the grayed out options.
[3125.18s -> 3133.68s]  Creep tiles like tumor pumpkin biomass would stay even after base structure is gone. Eternal lava.
[3133.68s -> 3160.96s]  Okay. Make a volcano. Look at the grayed out options. Hold on. Let me see. Peaceful monsters.
[3162.93s -> 3169.49s]  A hundred. Limit maximum population of a hundred. Villagers will also participate in insane. Really?
[3169.49s -> 3198.91s]  Okay. That's fine. Go up. Hold on a sec. This is as high as, as high as I can go. Kingdom tab. Let's see.
[3198.91s -> 3224.96s]  Okay. Is it still snowing over here? Mods are watching Sopranos. Oh, that's all right. So,
[3224.96s -> 3242.61s]  let's do, what is this? Under development. Okay. Force a kingdom to war. I think this is probably
[3242.61s -> 3265.66s]  going to be very hard to beat. Everyone's kind of just chilling. This is fine. I want to speed it
[3265.66s -> 3278.96s]  up one more time. Another times five and see what happens. Put on earthbound OST. No, that's all
[3278.96s -> 3303.06s]  good. I need to concentrate. Maybe in a minute. All right. It's time. Here we go. Here's my plan.
[3303.06s -> 3317.10s]  I want to see. Crabzilla. I feel like Crabzilla is going to end the whole thing. If I, if I click
[3317.10s -> 3331.62s]  Crabzilla, this is going to be a disaster. This was not my plan to play this all night, by the way.
[3331.62s -> 3337.98s]  I just wanted to check it out. I really liked this so far though. It's fun. Just like kind of
[3337.98s -> 3358.40s]  people watching. Save it. Oh my God. Thank you. Uh, where's the, no, do not quit. There it is.
[3358.40s -> 3367.22s]  Actually, I want to, I want to see the difference. What's the difference? 14 years versus 85,
[3367.22s -> 3376.59s]  four kingdoms, three, two cultures, five, three villages, seven, and then 359 population. Okay.
[3379.50s -> 3384.83s]  Uh, I'm just, I'm curious. I'm, I'm curious to see what happens here. Let's, let's do something weird.
[3385.55s -> 3401.89s]  Um, okay. Lava cloud. Robot Santa. Where should robot Santa spawn? How about over here in candy
[3401.89s -> 3424.72s]  world? Okay. So what, what are these two Santas? He's not doing anything. Oh, it's for everything.
[3424.72s -> 3438.34s]  Right. Okay. Okay. Well, I'm really glad I spawned that over here. Wait, this, look at this. Hold on
[3438.34s -> 3447.52s]  a second. I have an idea. What am I doing? Just staying over here? Oh, it's cause I can only go
[3447.52s -> 3488.43s]  here. Okay. It's forest soil and I put grass. I'll connect it. I'm going to put grass. I'm,
[3488.43s -> 3495.15s]  I'm very curious to see what happens here. You can make the world way bigger. That's pretty cool,
[3495.15s -> 3505.41s]  but let's see what happens when I do this. Uh, let's make some more elves over here.
[3505.41s -> 3527.95s]  Give them a chance. Let's give them a shitload of resources too. Why not? A bunch of water,
[3527.95s -> 3545.09s]  bunch of seeds, bunch of mushrooms, a bunch of enchanted seeds, a ton of lemon seeds,
[3545.09s -> 3551.86s]  tons of fertilizer. Oops. Bunch of fruit bushes. All right. This is the place to be.
[3555.89s -> 3579.12s]  Lemon Island. Animals. I put some already. They're fighting. Okay. Let's see what happens.
[3579.12s -> 3584.30s]  There was no pole, right? So I can just kind of mess around. Now that we have the world is here.
[3585.92s -> 3598.46s]  Ooh, they split off. Take a look. How are the demons? The demons have the same three. I'm
[3598.46s -> 3605.18s]  connecting. Why? They haven't developed any technology. They've just been walking around.
[3605.18s -> 3615.14s]  Give the orcs a boss to fight. That's a good idea. All right. The orcs are going to fight
[3615.14s -> 3628.10s]  five skeletons. Let's see if they can handle it. They look at how huge they are. Here we go. Ready?
[3628.74s -> 3638.16s]  They destroyed it. Oh my God. That wasn't even a... All right. What about a dragon? All right. It's
[3638.16s -> 3642.66s]  time for a dragon. We're putting a dragon into the orc kingdom and we're going to put it up in the
[3642.66s -> 3668.72s]  corner. Here we go. What is going on? Are these monkeys? Wait, there's monkeys that have made...
[3671.74s -> 3682.40s]  It wants nothing to do with the monkeys over there. Why are there so many? I didn't put these here.
[3687.25s -> 3708.80s]  Oh my goodness. Okay. Get him. Get the dragon. Fight it. What are they even throwing? I actually
[3708.80s -> 3717.92s]  don't want the kingdom over here to die, so I'm going to help. All right. Now blow it up.
[3717.92s -> 3735.50s]  Fuck. What happened? Shit. Oh no. Sorry. They can rebuild. They can rebuild. They can rebuild.
[3735.50s -> 3753.81s]  I got to bless them. I got to help them. No, everyone's fine. They're doing just fine over
[3753.81s -> 3762.88s]  here. You better stay the fuck away from Monkey Island. In fact, I don't trust that you won't.
[3765.12s -> 3786.43s]  Change the size of the rain. How do I make it bigger? Oh, right. Like this. Ooh. All right.
[3786.43s -> 3819.84s]  Let's bless everyone with the cooling, clean, crisp mist. Here we go. Civilization simulator.
[3819.84s -> 3843.15s]  All right. How about... People are drowning? Who? What are you talking about? You're stuck in the
[3843.15s -> 3866.85s]  wood. You're stuck in the wood age? This is going well over here. They need minerals. Okay. Like
[3866.85s -> 3911.34s]  ore. All right. Give the monkeys gold. Yeah. It's a good idea. They deserve it. You know what? Let's
[3911.34s -> 3918.99s]  put some gold over here too. Let's just give it to everybody. We need to make this a little
[3918.99s -> 3942.83s]  more enticing over here. Some mithril. So are they going to start making more advanced things?
[3942.83s -> 3964.56s]  Silver. The monkeys don't even care about this. Oh god damn it. Oh, I think I just killed a few
[3964.56s -> 3984.86s]  people. Stone. You got to get through the demons. All right. Let's pass some time. Let's see what
[3984.86s -> 4006.42s]  happens to our civilizations. Curious. Okay. Oh, wait a minute. Something happening over here.
[4010.51s -> 4020.75s]  This group in the middle here has gotten really, really a lot of people and they're starting to...
[4020.75s -> 4028.83s]  Yeah, this is a problem right here. The elves have... The elves are probably going to take it.
[4028.83s -> 4056.11s]  We need more metal. Do we need more metal? More ore too. Should I just make ore island? Okay. I'm
[4056.11s -> 4080.24s]  going to just make a... I'm going to pick an ore island. Just one piece. No, this is just
[4080.24s -> 4095.73s]  developer island. Okay. Stone. I think it's a little smaller. They're already coming over here.
[4095.73s -> 4106.27s]  Oh, wait. The demons. The demons can actually make it over here now. Oh, big mistake. They one shot
[4106.27s -> 4113.50s]  everybody. That's not good. I think that was just the king. Well, stop coming over here. What are
[4113.50s -> 4137.36s]  you doing? Stop. Why? You know what? Just let them fight. They're slowly just trickling over
[4137.36s -> 4145.55s]  here and dying. I don't know why they're just running over here. They're slowly... All right.
[4156.16s -> 4171.57s]  Why are you still alive? Dude, get out of here. Thank God. I may have just made a big mistake.
[4171.57s -> 4181.34s]  Well, that's their army, right? One demon is going through this whole thing. Okay. They got it. A
[4181.34s -> 4199.63s]  lot of people died though. Oh, they've made another kingdom. Okay. Let's keep going. All right. This
[4199.71s -> 4212.93s]  silver. Let's do ore and then I'm going to speed it up times five and see what happens. No, no,
[4212.93s -> 4216.69s]  no. You don't own this. This is, this is developer island. You don't own this.
[4230.56s -> 4235.20s]  Nobody owns this. Nobody owns this. Stop making a, you're not making a town here.
[4241.25s -> 4247.95s]  You're really going to... All right. Who are these people? You're really going to come over
[4247.95s -> 4265.62s]  here and claim developer island. Now you've angered me. Holy shit. That's not what I thought that was
[4265.62s -> 4282.86s]  going to do, but it worked. Oh, I thought it bounced down. It's okay. It's all good.
[4286.46s -> 4295.49s]  Stop, stop. You know what? Whatever. Go ahead and claim it. How's monkey island doing?
[4295.49s -> 4302.48s]  They're thriving up here. Look at it. Everything's peaceful. Everyone's friends.
[4302.48s -> 4310.66s]  It's rhinoceroses and chickens and frogs. They defended it from a dragon. They have growing trees.
[4310.66s -> 4331.07s]  They're being sustainable up here. Look at this. I want a little bit more ore. Let's do gold too.
[4331.39s -> 4348.91s]  And then adamantite. Okay. We have our ore island and let's do some bushes too. Berries.
[4348.91s -> 4369.73s]  Oh, I can't put it there. Why not? Sure. We're like a geyser again. I mean, this is,
[4369.73s -> 4378.08s]  wouldn't you want to claim this whole area? If you've got like 10 different civilizations on
[4378.08s -> 4387.18s]  earth and all the resources are running out and all of a sudden half a mile off the coast,
[4387.18s -> 4394.30s]  the water level drops and there's an island with every valuable resource ever invented,
[4394.30s -> 4408.78s]  you're going to cause a lot of problems. Okay. Let's speed it up and then we can do some wacky
[4408.78s -> 4414.90s]  stuff. They've already, yeah, they already claimed it. The humans. Wait, is it the humans or the
[4414.90s -> 4420.90s]  dwarves? I don't know, but this is going to be a fight here. They've already claimed it.
[4429.63s -> 4440.64s]  Kingdom lair. Looks like these two are, this one's doing the best. This one's stayed out of most of
[4440.64s -> 4450.85s]  the conflict. This one stayed pretty much not any fights or anything. These people have been in a
[4450.85s -> 4455.20s]  fight. These people obviously have been in a fight. The elves have not really done very much.
[4462.35s -> 4471.73s]  Monkey islands doing fine. Wait, monkey islands getting attacked by lightning. Oh no, it's not.
[4471.73s -> 4491.66s]  Okay, cool. That's not good. It's happening over here. Which island is mine? I don't know.
[4491.66s -> 4502.67s]  They're on the border over here. The other thing that I was going to do today, I wanted to play
[4502.67s -> 4520.32s]  pizza tower. I was going to load that up after this. Everybody hates the candy kingdom. Yeah,
[4520.32s -> 4526.45s]  I'm surprised. Nobody's, yeah, I think nobody likes it. Let's get some stats here.
[4526.45s -> 4546.94s]  520. Infected. Infected. I don't know what that means. Yeah, they claimed it. All right,
[4546.94s -> 4555.50s]  let's see what happens. I'm going to do this. Let's see if there is anything. Let me save it
[4555.50s -> 4565.79s]  first. I like looking at the progress. It's cool. Let's see. Ready? Yeah. Look at the left and then
[4565.79s -> 4583.74s]  all the way to the right. 14, 85, 129. Population slowly increasing. Okay. Uh, try summon the giant
[4583.74s -> 4608.32s]  crab. Gray goo? Do crabzilla. Okay. Where should crabzilla spawn? All right. Good luck, everybody.
[4608.32s -> 4626.83s]  Wait, I control it? Well, okay. Well, they're all gone. Are you serious? I'm unstoppable.
[4637.68s -> 4642.66s]  Nobody is going to stop me. I'm sorry. That's how would they ever deal with this?
[4643.06s -> 4669.22s]  Can I be killed? Okay. All right. Oh, I didn't, I didn't think that was going to happen. Sorry.
[4669.22s -> 4676.85s]  Uh, a-otade. Sorry. Almost all of the earth. They already took almost all the resources.
[4676.85s -> 4705.47s]  What about here? Lava cloud. I'm curious. One person. One person. It's just like,
[4705.47s -> 4718.67s]  holy shit. I don't even know what just happened, but I will rebuild. Good luck.
[4718.67s -> 4734.05s]  That's determination right there. All right. What else can I do here? How about, um, earthquake?
[4734.05s -> 4760.48s]  Where should I do it? Oh my goodness. Damn. Okay. Hey, make a hot climate up here. Infinity coin.
[4760.48s -> 4781.18s]  Meteor eat ray. Really guys? Really? Now, now you decide to go in after all that.
[4784.67s -> 4790.90s]  Was this seen as an opportunity of weakness where a bunch of this got wiped out? So they're like,
[4790.90s -> 4803.94s]  all right, well, let's go in. That's kind of messed up. They have flaming swords. They're
[4803.94s -> 4808.56s]  running now. Like, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. Wait. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[4808.56s -> 4814.80s]  Now it's actual constant total conflict. Everybody. Okay. The everybody's just fight.
[4814.80s -> 4825.30s]  Everybody's just attacking each other. I don't even know who is it. Wait, I need to see the map.
[4825.30s -> 4833.86s]  That the kingdom map thing. Ooh, it's pretty splintered. They're trying to take this. They're
[4833.86s -> 4853.26s]  not going to get it. Especially when a cloud of acid rains. Now they didn't get it. That's a very,
[4855.47s -> 4867.18s]  oh my goodness. That's loud. Why is this as a typewriter?
[4875.02s -> 4904.26s]  Everything is wow. This person is very big. All right. Stop, stop typewriter ring. They don't
[4904.26s -> 4916.43s]  even care. I got it saved. So don't worry. We're good. What about this? What's gray goo?
[4936.21s -> 4948.21s]  I didn't want to do. Okay. Oh my God. It's eating the whole place. What are they going to do?
[4948.21s -> 4975.28s]  Why are this person so big? Oh Jesus. Oh my goodness. How do I stop it? How do you stop it?
[4975.28s -> 4984.46s]  How do I stop it? I didn't want to. Okay. That's not what I wanted to do. That's, I wanted to,
[4984.46s -> 4990.27s]  you said, I didn't know it was going to be that big. I didn't know it was going to be that big.
[4990.27s -> 5006.50s]  Water? Dude, water is not going to stop this. How do I stop it? You can't stop the gray goo event.
[5006.50s -> 5014.62s]  No, no, not monkey Island. Anything but monkey Island. Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop. Pause.
[5014.62s -> 5056.99s]  Oh my goodness. Escape route. No, no, stop. Stop. I'm trying to save. I'm trying to save somebody.
[5056.99s -> 5069.73s]  Is there anybody left? No, you don't understand. Go over this way. You don't get it. There's one
[5069.73s -> 5078.14s]  other rhino that you guys need to make friends right now. Well, wait. Okay. At least we have.
[5078.14s -> 5140.82s]  All right. Well, that was kind of fun. That was world, um, world box. That was my favorite
[5140.82s -> 5153.42s]  character. How dare you? All right. That was world box. That seemed kind of crazy. Let's,
[5153.42s -> 5161.94s]  let's move on to pizza pizza tower. I did not know that that was going to do what that did.
[5161.94s -> 5171.38s]  I thought it was just going to make some goo on the ground. That's fun. Tired of it. No, not really.
[5171.38s -> 5179.06s]  I just, you know, I feel like if you wanted to really, really make a ton of kingdoms and stuff
[5179.06s -> 5188.54s]  kind of, my brain is a little too small for that, but definitely fun to play. All right. Pizza tower
[5188.54s -> 5210.14s]  time. How about sorcery? Uh, no plan for that right now. I got to plug this in. Uh, yeah. Let
[5210.14s -> 5216.51s]  me disclose this. Give me one sec. BRB for two minutes or three minutes. Give me a sec.
