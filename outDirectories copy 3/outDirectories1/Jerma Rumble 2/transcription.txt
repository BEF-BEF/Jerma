[0.31s -> 14.90s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the second ever Jerma Rumble.
[14.90s -> 19.40s]  I hope you're ready for some newcomers as well as some old favorites.
[19.40s -> 25.86s]  So sit back and relax, and here we go with the Jerma Rumble.
[25.86s -> 29.86s]  Alright, and with that introduction, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, we're going to get started here.
[29.86s -> 33.36s]  Welcome to the second Jerma Rumble. I'm glad to be your presenter.
[33.36s -> 36.86s]  And the first one to come down the ring is going to be Astronaut Spaceman Star,
[36.86s -> 39.86s]  who just got back from his 72nd expedition.
[39.86s -> 43.86s]  So if we could give him a round of applause to Star for that, that's a very good accomplishment.
[43.86s -> 48.16s]  And he'll be number one, and that's not an easy position to have.
[48.16s -> 53.16s]  Number two is going to be Pac-Man. Pac-Man is a newcomer to the Jerma Rumble.
[53.16s -> 58.16s]  He is brand new here. He said he wanted to come in, wanted to take over, wanted to use his big, orange, disgusting, ugly bits.
[58.16s -> 60.16s]  And he's getting kind of startled by something there on the...
[60.16s -> 64.16s]  I'm not sure if there was a mouse or what was there, but Pac-Man's ready to go.
[64.16s -> 67.16s]  And he's number two. Both of these guys are going to have quite a difficult time.
[67.16s -> 69.16s]  You saw what happened last time.
[69.16s -> 75.16s]  The first five are so, so much at a disadvantage than the last five.
[75.16s -> 78.16s]  But the bell has been rung. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get started here.
[78.16s -> 81.16s]  Welcome to the second ever Jerma Rumble. No more time wasted.
[81.16s -> 87.16s]  Here we go. Star and Pac-Man fighting in the ring, and immediately Star going for the Pac-Man chest push.
[87.16s -> 91.16s]  He's going to try to get him over that top rope. Remember, you have to go over the top rope.
[91.16s -> 94.16s]  Pac-Man not going to have any of that as of right now.
[94.16s -> 97.16s]  Spins around Star, throws him into the rope.
[97.16s -> 101.16s]  Star does a little jump over that side there, which is a pretty nifty move.
[101.16s -> 104.16s]  And initially, it always starts like this.
[104.16s -> 107.16s]  Somebody always goes for a push, somebody reverses it, somebody throws it.
[107.16s -> 109.16s]  You know, the AI is fucking stupid, alright?
[109.16s -> 113.16s]  So let's just put it that way. What a move by Pac-Man throwing him in the air and dropping him on his belly.
[113.16s -> 116.16s]  And just like that, we have our first new entrance.
[116.16s -> 119.16s]  It could be anybody. Ladies and gentlemen, it's Grandpa.
[119.16s -> 123.53s]  Coming down to the Jerma Arena with what seems like a couple of foreign objects there.
[123.53s -> 126.53s]  I think somebody needs to tell him he cannot bring that Kendo stick down to the ring.
[126.53s -> 130.83s]  And he's got a Soda in the other hand. Now that's definitely not Soda.
[130.83s -> 133.33s]  I can guarantee that's not Soda.
[133.33s -> 136.33s]  So if somebody gets that stick away from him, do not let him in the ring with that stick.
[136.33s -> 137.33s]  He could hurt somebody.
[137.33s -> 139.50s]  Anyways, coming back to the action here, we've got a block.
[139.50s -> 142.50s]  What a punch by Pac-Man, and down goes Star.
[142.50s -> 144.50s]  What a beautiful right hand to his head.
[144.50s -> 146.50s]  And he's wearing a helmet too.
[146.50s -> 148.50s]  You've got to figure some of that damage would be blocked.
[148.50s -> 152.50s]  And immediate reaction to Grandpa coming to the ring with a belly-to-back slam on the back.
[152.50s -> 154.50s]  And Pac-Man is taunting. Pac-Man is here.
[154.50s -> 156.50s]  What a fantastic display so far.
[156.50s -> 159.50s]  He is doing work on both of these two competitors.
[159.50s -> 161.50s]  And now he's going to take a little bit of a breather.
[161.50s -> 164.50s]  Maybe they'll try to both eliminate Grandpa. That's a good idea.
[164.50s -> 165.50s]  He's trying to.
[165.50s -> 168.87s]  Seems like he may have injured his left shoulder there.
[168.87s -> 170.87s]  If you saw that, he was favoring that left shoulder.
[170.87s -> 174.87s]  Maybe when he picked up Grandpa and did the slam, he might have hurt himself.
[174.87s -> 177.87s]  Now that's a very bad thing. It's very early here.
[177.87s -> 178.87s]  And you do not...
[178.87s -> 182.87s]  What a beautiful double-teaming front neck breaker by the two, Grandpa and Pac-Man.
[182.87s -> 184.87s]  But what I was saying is, you've got to be careful here.
[184.87s -> 189.87s]  If he is injured, if Pac-Man is hurt, he could be eliminated very, very shortly.
[189.87s -> 194.18s]  But there is the buzzer time to go check out who is the next person to come in the ring.
[194.18s -> 196.18s]  It could be anybody. It could be your brother. It could be your sister.
[196.18s -> 200.48s]  It could even be the Spy Party Monopoly Guy.
[200.48s -> 204.48s]  That's who it is, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome the Monopoly Guy to the German Arena.
[204.48s -> 208.48s]  And the funny thing about the Monopoly Guy is he is not the Monopoly Guy.
[208.48s -> 210.48s]  He just was an...Germa is an idiot.
[210.48s -> 213.48s]  Instead, he was the Monopoly Guy when he actually is more like Sir Topham Hatt.
[213.48s -> 215.48s]  But whatever, Monopoly Guy showing himself for the first time.
[215.48s -> 217.48s]  And what a lunging elbow to Starr.
[217.48s -> 221.48s]  Starr has been receiving a lot of pain in this initial period.
[221.48s -> 224.48s]  Grandpa almost goes over the top. Pac-Man almost eliminates Grandpa.
[224.48s -> 227.66s]  And Pac-Man just kind of lets him get up.
[227.66s -> 230.96s]  Something that's very, very interesting here, guys.
[230.96s -> 232.96s]  No eliminations.
[232.96s -> 234.96s]  There has not been any eliminations yet.
[234.96s -> 236.96s]  Everybody is still in this ring.
[236.96s -> 238.96s]  And we're going to have another person coming down here.
[238.96s -> 240.96s]  Another competitor. Very, very shortly.
[240.96s -> 243.96s]  Great reversal by Grandpa, as I say that.
[243.96s -> 245.96s]  Into another reversal by Pac-Man.
[245.96s -> 249.96s]  But take a look at this. We're going to have five people here without a single elimination.
[249.96s -> 252.96s]  It's going to start to get crowded. It's going to start to get crazy.
[252.96s -> 255.96s]  And what better time to introduce another person to have five in the ring.
[255.96s -> 257.96s]  Who's it going to be, ladies and gentlemen?
[257.96s -> 260.65s]  It's Gabe Newell. And listen to that crowd roar.
[260.65s -> 262.65s]  He's sprinting down to the arena.
[262.65s -> 264.65s]  He's not going to mess around like last time.
[264.65s -> 266.65s]  He's spent a lot of time in that arena.
[266.65s -> 268.65s]  A lot of time training since that event.
[268.65s -> 270.65s]  And my goodness gracious, everyone is so excited to see him.
[270.65s -> 273.65s]  Gabe, welcome back to the Jerma Arena.
[273.65s -> 275.65s]  So we got a little crowded here.
[275.65s -> 277.65s]  Five in here, like I said previously.
[277.65s -> 281.65s]  Gabe Newell is holding the Monopoly guy back by his arms.
[281.65s -> 283.65s]  And letting Star punch him in the stomach.
[283.65s -> 285.82s]  That was a little bit odd.
[285.82s -> 287.82s]  And now Star kind of changing his heart a little bit.
[287.82s -> 289.82s]  Going with a headbutt to Gabe Newell with that helmet on.
[289.82s -> 291.82s]  That should be illegal.
[291.82s -> 294.82s]  He should be thrown out for that disgraceful thing there.
[294.82s -> 296.82s]  But Star kind of...
[296.82s -> 298.82s]  But no one's getting eliminated. This is ridiculous.
[298.82s -> 301.00s]  We're going to have six people in this ring.
[301.00s -> 303.00s]  That could be a first for the Jerma Rumble.
[303.00s -> 307.00s]  Six or seven I think is the maximum amount of people that were in the last one.
[307.00s -> 309.18s]  And here comes somebody else.
[309.18s -> 313.18s]  Rounding up the number six spot is going to be an infamous gaming character.
[313.18s -> 315.18s]  Throwing up the three sign.
[315.18s -> 318.18s]  Trying to give us a hint maybe on one of his future games.
[318.18s -> 323.17s]  The iconic, the wonderful, the scientific Gordon Freeman.
[323.17s -> 325.17s]  Gordon Freeman making his debut here.
[325.17s -> 326.17s]  Gabe Newell's in the ring.
[326.17s -> 330.17s]  Gabe Newell cannot be happy about that announcement for Half-Life 3.
[330.17s -> 332.98s]  I would not be if I was in Gabe's shoes.
[332.98s -> 335.98s]  And speaking of Gabe, gets grabbed by the Monopoly guy behind him.
[335.98s -> 337.98s]  Kicks him right in his Achilles heel and punches him in the head.
[337.98s -> 338.98s]  No, he misses.
[338.98s -> 340.98s]  But he ends up picking up Gordon Freeman and throwing him around.
[340.98s -> 341.98s]  And a slam.
[341.98s -> 342.98s]  And Star has been eliminated.
[342.98s -> 345.98s]  Star is the first person in the Jerma Rumble to be eliminated.
[345.98s -> 346.98s]  Too bad, Star.
[346.98s -> 348.98s]  We had high hopes for you.
[348.98s -> 351.98s]  With that sweeping slam by Gordon Freeman on Gabe Newell.
[351.98s -> 354.98s]  Something tells me there's going to be a rivalry there.
[354.98s -> 356.98s]  They are probably going to be very annoyed with each other.
[356.98s -> 357.98s]  Especially because of that announcement.
[357.98s -> 358.98s]  They're both in trouble.
[358.98s -> 359.98s]  Gordon Freeman now.
[359.98s -> 362.98s]  Looks like he's getting double teamed by Pac-Man and the Monopoly guy.
[362.98s -> 363.98s]  Is he going to come out?
[363.98s -> 365.98s]  Could Gordon Freeman be that quickly eliminated?
[365.98s -> 367.98s]  It would be such a shame if he was.
[367.98s -> 369.98s]  No, he's holding on for dear life.
[369.98s -> 371.98s]  And he stays in.
[371.98s -> 374.98s]  And we've got Gabe Newell with a crushing lariat to Grandpa.
[374.98s -> 376.98s]  And he goes over the top turnbuckle.
[376.98s -> 379.98s]  Which means you are eliminated, Grandpa.
[379.98s -> 380.98s]  You didn't make it this time.
[380.98s -> 381.98s]  You didn't make it last time.
[381.98s -> 382.98s]  You keep coming up short.
[382.98s -> 383.98s]  You need to go back and train.
[383.98s -> 386.98s]  You don't drink beer out of a soda can to train.
[386.98s -> 388.98s]  Maybe you'll learn that next time.
[388.98s -> 390.98s]  Anyways, guys, we've got four people in the ring.
[390.98s -> 392.98s]  It's kind of lightened up a little bit.
[392.98s -> 394.98s]  There is not six people.
[394.98s -> 398.98s]  There are not six huge men poking in this ring.
[398.98s -> 399.98s]  There's only four now.
[399.98s -> 401.98s]  Very interesting dynamic, though.
[401.98s -> 404.16s]  But we've got somebody coming out here in about 10 seconds.
[404.16s -> 405.16s]  I wonder who it's going to be.
[405.16s -> 406.16s]  Not sure.
[406.16s -> 410.16s]  Gabe Newell accepting a bunch of punches by Pac-Man.
[410.16s -> 411.16s]  But he ends up dodging the last one.
[411.16s -> 412.16s]  But it's OK.
[412.16s -> 415.40s]  Because we have another competitor coming down right now.
[415.40s -> 416.40s]  And if you don't recognize this guy,
[416.40s -> 418.40s]  then I will be glad to help you with that.
[418.40s -> 421.40s]  He's one of the top Team Fortress 2 competitive players in the world.
[421.40s -> 422.83s]  It's Mela.
[422.83s -> 427.07s]  Mela, ladies and gentlemen, making his debut to the Jerma Arena.
[427.07s -> 430.07s]  Just casually walking down to the ring.
[430.07s -> 432.07s]  But you've got to give him a little bit of credit for that.
[432.07s -> 434.07s]  He's conserving his energy.
[434.07s -> 435.07s]  Sliding into the ring.
[435.07s -> 436.07s]  There he is.
[436.07s -> 438.63s]  Being a cocky asshole, it seems.
[438.63s -> 440.63s]  He just gets in the ring and starts taunting.
[440.63s -> 442.63s]  Nobody really seems to mind.
[442.63s -> 445.63s]  And he does a nice little elbow drop there on the Monopoly guy.
[445.63s -> 446.63s]  Got five people here.
[446.63s -> 448.63s]  Gabe Newell going for some punches on Mela.
[448.63s -> 449.63s]  Gets blocked by one of them.
[449.63s -> 451.63s]  Pac-Man is just missing people.
[451.63s -> 452.63s]  He's trying to grab people.
[452.63s -> 455.63s]  But he's just missing over and over again.
[455.63s -> 458.63s]  And that's what happens when your brain is the size of a dog brain.
[458.63s -> 461.63s]  If you don't know how big a dog brain is, they're pretty small.
[461.63s -> 464.63s]  And Gabe Newell now could be throwing Mela out immediately.
[464.63s -> 466.63s]  He's got him almost over the whole turnbuckle.
[466.63s -> 469.63s]  I thought he was going over.
[469.63s -> 471.63s]  That was some sheer strength by Mela.
[471.63s -> 473.63s]  And Pac-Man has been punched in the face over the top.
[473.63s -> 474.63s]  He's out.
[474.63s -> 477.63s]  The first person to be introduced is now eliminated.
[477.63s -> 480.06s]  And we've got somebody else coming down.
[480.06s -> 482.06s]  Hailing from your local neighborhood daring.
[482.06s -> 483.37s]  He's primed.
[483.37s -> 484.37s]  He's ready.
[484.37s -> 486.37s]  He's a 30s milkman.
[486.37s -> 487.93s]  Yeah, I know.
[487.93s -> 488.93s]  I know.
[488.93s -> 489.93s]  This guy sucks.
[489.93s -> 491.93s]  Yeah, this guy is probably worse than Batboy.
[491.93s -> 496.93s]  But sometimes you just have to have a 30s milkman be part of a Royal Rumble.
[496.93s -> 498.23s]  But whatever.
[498.23s -> 499.23s]  He's here.
[499.23s -> 501.23s]  Milkman is in German Rumble too.
[501.23s -> 503.23s]  And it's something we're all going to have to come to terms with.
[503.23s -> 505.23s]  But let's start talking about the action again.
[505.23s -> 509.23s]  We've got Gabe Newell kind of walking around aimlessly in the top right.
[509.23s -> 511.23s]  Not really sure where he wants to go.
[511.23s -> 513.23s]  Beautiful leg sweep there by Gordon Freeman.
[513.23s -> 514.23s]  And bang!
[514.23s -> 515.23s]  What a kick to the face.
[515.23s -> 516.23s]  And there goes the Monopoly guy.
[516.23s -> 517.23s]  See you next time.
[517.23s -> 520.23s]  Maybe you won't get shot in the face immediately in Spy Party.
[520.23s -> 522.23s]  Even though you will because that's how the game is played.
[522.23s -> 524.23s]  And a scoop slam by the milkman.
[524.23s -> 528.23s]  And now we've got something interesting, ladies and gents.
[528.23s -> 533.23s]  We've got Gordon Freeman and Gabe Newell fighting in the top right here.
[533.23s -> 535.23s]  This is a score that needs to be settled.
[535.23s -> 540.23s]  And it looks like Gordon Freeman has the upper hand destroying Gabe Newell in this last couple exchanges.
[540.23s -> 541.23s]  A third exchange.
[541.23s -> 545.23s]  Gabe Newell is getting destroyed, getting crushed, getting humiliated.
[545.23s -> 546.23s]  Just trying to stay alive.
[546.23s -> 548.23s]  He keeps getting blocked and countered and reversed.
[548.23s -> 549.23s]  It's horrible.
[549.23s -> 550.23s]  It's horrible.
[550.23s -> 552.23s]  Gabe Newell cannot do anything right now to Gordon Freeman.
[552.23s -> 554.23s]  And Gordon Freeman jumping on his leg.
[554.23s -> 555.23s]  This could be bad.
[555.23s -> 556.23s]  Gabe Newell has been eliminated.
[556.23s -> 557.23s]  Gabe Newell has been.
[557.23s -> 560.23s]  He tried to set up a powerbomb over the tough turnbuckle.
[560.23s -> 561.23s]  That could have gone either way.
[561.23s -> 563.23s]  But Gabe Newell is out.
[563.23s -> 565.23s]  And here comes Earthworm Jim.
[565.23s -> 566.47s]  Feeling that crowd.
[566.47s -> 567.47s]  Getting so pumped up.
[567.47s -> 572.47s]  It's so bad to see something so sad and then something so happy like Earthworm Jim's debut.
[572.47s -> 575.47s]  Gabe Newell is still standing at ringside.
[575.47s -> 577.47s]  He is shocked as are we all.
[577.47s -> 579.47s]  We can't believe he was eliminated.
[579.47s -> 583.47s]  Gordon Freeman with that incredible hurricanrana over the top rope.
[583.47s -> 588.47s]  I really thought we were going to see a repeat from last time when Gabe Newell powerbombed Sonic over the top.
[588.47s -> 590.47s]  But that is just not what happened.
[590.47s -> 592.47s]  And there's got to be a metaphor there.
[592.47s -> 594.65s]  There's a metaphor buried in there somewhere.
[594.65s -> 595.65s]  I just can't seem to find it at the moment.
[595.65s -> 598.65s]  But Earthworm Jim now has Gordon Freeman over the top rope.
[598.65s -> 600.65s]  Maybe some revenge enacted.
[600.65s -> 601.65s]  And there's the revenge right there.
[601.65s -> 605.65s]  Earthworm Jim comes in, gives him the finger, tells him to go screw himself.
[605.65s -> 606.65s]  And there it is right there.
[606.65s -> 608.65s]  Gordon Freeman is livid right now.
[608.65s -> 610.65s]  And there is another elimination.
[610.65s -> 612.65s]  We've got three people left in the ring.
[612.65s -> 617.65s]  Earthworm Jim, Mela, and the 30s milkman with somebody else on the way.
[617.65s -> 621.21s]  This is going to put us at the halfway point.
[621.21s -> 626.21s]  And who else to put us at the halfway point than the most iconic gaming character to ever live?
[626.21s -> 627.21s]  That's right.
[627.21s -> 629.21s]  It's Super Mario.
[629.21s -> 633.64s]  Showing off his patented long jump, super jump, whatever you want to call it.
[633.64s -> 640.64s]  It's such an honor to have the real, absolute not fake Super Mario from Nintendo
[640.64s -> 643.64s]  and not a drunk beer in a Mario costume.
[643.64s -> 645.94s]  It is just such an honor.
[645.94s -> 648.94s]  What a side super kick there by the beer, by Mario.
[648.94s -> 650.94s]  That was just so unbelievable.
[650.94s -> 651.94s]  Took us head off almost.
[651.94s -> 653.94s]  I wonder if Mela still has teeth.
[653.94s -> 656.31s]  You know, I want to talk about Earthworm Jim.
[656.31s -> 658.31s]  I want to talk about Jim for just a second here.
[658.31s -> 659.31s]  He's an underdog.
[659.31s -> 662.31s]  I'm rooting for Earthworm Jim because he hasn't had a game in a long time.
[662.31s -> 664.31s]  He's been kind of under the radar.
[664.31s -> 666.31s]  He hasn't been at the gaming scene, really.
[666.31s -> 669.31s]  There's been talks over the years that he was going to come back and do some more games,
[669.31s -> 671.31s]  but it hasn't really surfaced yet.
[671.31s -> 674.31s]  And I really hope to see him flourish during this Rumble.
[674.31s -> 676.31s]  I don't know if you probably agree with me.
[676.31s -> 679.31s]  And we've got another competitor coming down here after the talk about Jim.
[679.31s -> 681.31s]  We're going to talk about other weird characters.
[681.31s -> 684.13s]  And who the hell is this?
[684.13s -> 685.13s]  Well, that makes sense.
[685.13s -> 686.13s]  It is right around the corner.
[686.13s -> 687.13s]  It's the Easter Bunny.
[687.13s -> 692.13s]  The Easter Bunny showing up, one of our first holiday-themed characters to be graced at the arena.
[693.13s -> 694.13s]  He's frolicking down.
[694.13s -> 695.13s]  No basket.
[695.13s -> 697.13s]  No goodies for the children today.
[697.13s -> 698.13s]  But, you know, who cares?
[698.13s -> 699.13s]  He's here to kick some ass.
[699.13s -> 703.13s]  He's here to fight, not to really make any children happy.
[703.13s -> 705.13s]  And he kind of has a weird hairy back.
[705.13s -> 706.13s]  That's a little strange.
[706.13s -> 707.13s]  He's supposed to have feathers.
[707.13s -> 708.13s]  And there goes the...
[708.13s -> 710.13s]  No, the Mario stays in.
[710.13s -> 712.13s]  Mario stays in to see another day.
[712.13s -> 715.30s]  And curiosity is now starting to peak in my brain.
[715.30s -> 718.30s]  Because, number one, you know that Jerma's going to show up at some point.
[718.30s -> 721.30s]  You know that Burger Boy's probably here at some fashion.
[721.30s -> 722.30s]  You know that people are here.
[722.30s -> 725.30s]  You just don't know in what order they're going to come out in.
[725.30s -> 727.30s]  And that's the beauty of the Rumble.
[727.30s -> 728.30s]  You never know.
[728.30s -> 729.30s]  It could be anybody.
[729.30s -> 730.30s]  It could be anything.
[730.30s -> 732.30s]  And we got some calm stuff going on.
[732.30s -> 736.30s]  No one really going for any large-scale moves here.
[736.30s -> 743.30s]  Except we got a corner match with less than two seconds to go before we get crowded again with six contestants.
[743.30s -> 745.30s]  And here comes number 12.
[745.30s -> 748.48s]  Your most celebrated president in United States history.
[748.48s -> 752.48s]  The eighth president of the United States, Martin Van Buren.
[752.48s -> 759.30s]  Now the real question is, how many people just Googled this fucking guy's name right now?
[759.30s -> 762.30s]  I'm going to say like 50% of the entire audience watching.
[762.30s -> 767.30s]  But anyways, Martin Van Buren showing up to overcrowd this already crowded ring.
[767.30s -> 768.30s]  And it looks like the Milkman's in some trouble.
[768.30s -> 770.30s]  Mario's going to dip the Milkman out.
[770.30s -> 771.30s]  Thank God.
[771.30s -> 773.54s]  If there is a Lord, he just showed it.
[773.54s -> 776.54s]  Because now the Milkman has no chance of winning this Rumble.
[776.54s -> 778.54s]  And Van God damn Buren showing in here.
[778.54s -> 783.54s]  Going to try and get picked up with a belly-to-belly suplex by Earthworm Jim.
[783.54s -> 785.54s]  Mela just kind of sitting there watching and waiting.
[785.54s -> 787.54s]  And Mela is kind of an interesting character.
[787.54s -> 788.54s]  Because he's real.
[788.54s -> 790.54s]  Obviously he's a real person.
[790.54s -> 792.54s]  Van Buren is also real.
[792.54s -> 794.54s]  And I guess you could say Mario is as well.
[794.54s -> 795.54s]  But how do you compete?
[795.54s -> 801.54s]  How do you cope knowing that there are plenty of these supernatural superhuman characters in here.
[801.54s -> 802.54s]  And you have to go against them.
[802.54s -> 804.54s]  And you might even have to kill them.
[804.54s -> 805.54s]  Or you might get killed by one of them.
[805.54s -> 806.54s]  We have not...
[806.54s -> 807.54s]  That's not unheard of.
[807.54s -> 812.02s]  Last time, if you remember, Bat Boy, Benjamin Franklin did kill him.
[812.02s -> 814.02s]  Benjamin Franklin ran him over with a truck.
[814.02s -> 818.02s]  And unfortunately, Benjamin Franklin is now in state penitentiary.
[818.02s -> 822.02s]  But it can be said, this does get dangerous.
[822.02s -> 828.02s]  And what a masterful double DDT on both Earthworm Jim and the Easter Bunny by Mario.
[828.02s -> 829.02s]  That was fantastic.
[829.02s -> 830.02s]  I don't know how he did that.
[830.02s -> 832.02s]  He kind of just grabbed them both by the head and just leaned back.
[832.02s -> 835.02s]  And his fat ass body just dragged everybody down to the ground.
[835.02s -> 837.02s]  Which is what you'd like to see.
[837.02s -> 838.02s]  And getting crowded again.
[838.02s -> 839.02s]  Here we go.
[839.02s -> 840.02s]  Another person coming down.
[840.02s -> 842.02s]  This one is going to be number 13.
[842.02s -> 844.02s]  And you all know who this is.
[844.02s -> 846.02s]  I don't even need to introduce this guy.
[846.02s -> 847.02s]  He looks pretty mad.
[847.02s -> 848.02s]  Looks pretty mean.
[848.02s -> 851.02s]  It's the Red Heavy from Team Fortress 2.
[851.02s -> 854.19s]  Not exactly sure why he has those bullets attached to him.
[854.19s -> 857.19s]  Because it kind of could get in the way in this arena.
[857.19s -> 858.19s]  It doesn't have a gun.
[858.19s -> 861.19s]  No guns are allowed at the Jerma Arena during these wrestling events.
[861.19s -> 862.19s]  But he's here.
[862.19s -> 864.19s]  And he's in the final ten.
[864.19s -> 866.19s]  So that means he has a significant chance.
[866.19s -> 873.19s]  Everybody in the ring right now has a significantly higher chance to win this rumble than the previous ten people.
[873.19s -> 874.19s]  That's how it works.
[874.19s -> 875.19s]  It's unfair.
[875.19s -> 876.19s]  It's unfortunate.
[876.19s -> 881.19s]  But if you are in the last ten people to be introduced while Earthworm Jim almost goes out.
[881.19s -> 883.19s]  Then you have a higher chance to win.
[883.19s -> 884.19s]  A much higher chance.
[884.19s -> 885.19s]  You're fresh.
[885.19s -> 886.19s]  You're prepared.
[886.19s -> 887.19s]  You're ready.
[887.19s -> 888.19s]  You haven't been fighting for long.
[888.19s -> 891.19s]  You can just get in there and do everything you can to try to win.
[891.19s -> 893.50s]  And speaking of the Heavy.
[893.50s -> 898.50s]  Heavy for some reason went immediately a beeline right for Super Mario.
[898.50s -> 899.50s]  No one's really sure.
[899.50s -> 900.50s]  Choking him now on the ropes.
[900.50s -> 901.50s]  And he's going to dip him over.
[901.50s -> 902.50s]  No.
[902.50s -> 904.50s]  I think you know what the problem is.
[904.50s -> 907.50s]  I think Mario Bia is just way too heavy.
[907.50s -> 909.50s]  You can't dump somebody over like that.
[909.50s -> 911.50s]  But you can do a big boot to Van Buren.
[911.50s -> 913.50s]  And that's how you eliminate Van Buren.
[913.50s -> 914.50s]  He is gone.
[914.50s -> 915.50s]  Sayonara.
[915.50s -> 919.74s]  Go get yourself a haircut you Wolverine looking old bastard.
[919.74s -> 921.74s]  Earthworm Jim in the meantime lying on the ground.
[921.74s -> 923.74s]  The Heavy favoring that left knee.
[923.74s -> 926.74s]  We all know that Earthworm Jim has had knee trouble in the past.
[926.74s -> 928.74s]  And the Heavy is definitely exploiting that.
[928.74s -> 929.74s]  Well you have the Easter Bunny on the right there.
[929.74s -> 930.74s]  No.
[930.74s -> 931.74s]  Bia didn't want to do anything about that.
[931.74s -> 935.74s]  Which is a little ridiculous considering he could have had an elimination under his belt.
[935.74s -> 936.74s]  But we're going to do number 14.
[936.74s -> 938.74s]  Number 14 is Season Boxing Veteran.
[938.74s -> 940.74s]  He's doing all kinds of shadow boxing.
[940.74s -> 941.74s]  He's ready.
[941.74s -> 942.74s]  He's been training.
[942.74s -> 944.74s]  As you can tell he's only been doing the bench press when he works out.
[944.74s -> 945.74s]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[945.74s -> 947.04s]  The Coathanger.
[947.04s -> 950.60s]  Coathanger is one of the stronger characters.
[950.60s -> 954.60s]  Probably a top seed because of his sheer upper body strength.
[954.60s -> 960.60s]  All the while the Easter Bunny takes a fist right to the face going over that top turnbuckle area.
[960.60s -> 961.60s]  He is not happy about that.
[961.60s -> 967.60s]  Easter Bunny say goodbye while a belly to back suplex by the Heavy is keeping Mela in check.
[967.60s -> 968.60s]  Who is still here.
[968.60s -> 970.60s]  Mela has been in this a long time.
[970.60s -> 974.60s]  Him and Earthworm Jim have spent quite a long time in the ring.
[974.60s -> 979.60s]  Here's hoping they can keep their energy levels up because we're coming down to number 15.
[979.60s -> 985.60s]  The last five entrants of the Jerma Rumble are coming in from this point forward.
[985.60s -> 988.60s]  So let's take a look at who number 15 is.
[988.60s -> 989.60s]  Number 15.
[989.60s -> 990.60s]  The crowd is going crazy right now.
[990.60s -> 992.60s]  The crowd is so riled up.
[992.60s -> 993.60s]  I'm not sure who this is.
[993.60s -> 995.60s]  Who could do such a huge response.
[995.60s -> 996.97s]  It's Captain Crunch.
[996.97s -> 999.27s]  Captain Crunch is in the arena.
[999.27s -> 1002.27s]  He doesn't give a shit if you think his cereal is way too sugary.
[1002.27s -> 1003.27s]  He's going to come down.
[1003.27s -> 1004.27s]  He's going to drop kick the fuck out of your grandmother.
[1004.27s -> 1006.27s]  It's Captain Crunch ladies and gentlemen.
[1006.27s -> 1007.27s]  The keeper.
[1007.27s -> 1008.27s]  The number one seed.
[1008.27s -> 1010.27s]  I knew we were going to be getting some surprises here.
[1010.27s -> 1013.27s]  But I did not expect the captain to make it happen.
[1013.27s -> 1015.27s]  Let's hope he does.
[1015.27s -> 1016.70s]  And not only the crowd.
[1016.70s -> 1018.70s]  Once Captain Crunch got in here.
[1018.70s -> 1020.70s]  The contestants are now riled up.
[1020.70s -> 1021.70s]  Doing moves left and right.
[1021.70s -> 1024.70s]  It was kind of catatonic until the captain came in.
[1024.70s -> 1027.70s]  Doing a slinging neck breaker slam on Earthworm Jim.
[1027.70s -> 1028.70s]  We've got a large punch.
[1028.70s -> 1029.70s]  We've got a lot of things going on.
[1029.70s -> 1031.70s]  All kinds of stuff happening in the Jerma Arena.
[1031.70s -> 1033.70s]  Captain Crunch really decided to rile things up.
[1033.70s -> 1034.70s]  Mela picking up the heavy.
[1034.70s -> 1036.70s]  Power slamming him down.
[1036.70s -> 1037.70s]  We've got two power slams.
[1037.70s -> 1038.70s]  Belly to belly suplex.
[1038.70s -> 1040.70s]  Action left and right here in the arena.
[1040.70s -> 1043.70s]  What a fantastic display of athleticism going on here.
[1043.70s -> 1048.70s]  I think that large surge of the crowd just reminded all the contestants that this is for keeps.
[1048.70s -> 1049.70s]  This is going on.
[1049.70s -> 1051.70s]  One of these people has a high chance to win.
[1051.70s -> 1053.70s]  Earthworm Jim setting up the kick.
[1053.70s -> 1054.70s]  There goes the coat hanger.
[1054.70s -> 1055.70s]  Take it easy.
[1055.70s -> 1056.70s]  See you next week.
[1056.70s -> 1057.70s]  See you next fall.
[1057.70s -> 1058.70s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[1058.70s -> 1060.70s]  Earthworm Jim for the win.
[1060.70s -> 1063.88s]  We've got Captain Crunch now whipping the heavy into the corner.
[1063.88s -> 1066.88s]  Reversal does not look good for the captain.
[1066.88s -> 1067.88s]  Getting picked up in a power bomb.
[1067.88s -> 1068.88s]  Maybe going over the top.
[1068.88s -> 1069.88s]  No.
[1069.88s -> 1070.88s]  Straight down in the back.
[1070.88s -> 1071.88s]  No, he's going to do it again.
[1071.88s -> 1072.88s]  He's going to do it again.
[1072.88s -> 1073.88s]  The captain.
[1073.88s -> 1074.88s]  Two power bombs.
[1074.88s -> 1075.88s]  He's going to go for a third one.
[1075.88s -> 1077.88s]  A third power bomb on Captain Crunch.
[1077.88s -> 1078.88s]  That's got to hurt.
[1078.88s -> 1080.88s]  The heavy is a very big man.
[1080.88s -> 1081.88s]  And a moonsault.
[1081.88s -> 1082.88s]  A backflip by Earthworm Jim.
[1082.88s -> 1084.88s]  And we've got another competitor coming down.
[1084.88s -> 1086.88s]  And did you see that super kick?
[1086.88s -> 1088.88s]  Mela just went over the top rope.
[1088.88s -> 1090.88s]  It's Santa Claus with a chainsaw.
[1090.88s -> 1094.88s]  Shit is getting insane here in the German arena.
[1094.88s -> 1095.88s]  You've got Santa Claus with a chainsaw.
[1095.88s -> 1097.88s]  You've got people flying over the top turnbuckle.
[1097.88s -> 1100.88s]  Somebody get that thing away from him before he hurts somebody.
[1100.88s -> 1102.88s]  Santa Claus from the North Pole.
[1102.88s -> 1104.88s]  Obviously shit-faced.
[1104.88s -> 1107.88s]  Get that thing away from him before he hurts somebody.
[1107.88s -> 1109.88s]  Security doing your damn job and get that.
[1109.88s -> 1110.88s]  Thank you.
[1110.88s -> 1111.88s]  Somebody did he drop it?
[1111.88s -> 1112.88s]  I think he just dropped it.
[1112.88s -> 1114.88s]  Somebody pick that up so that nobody gets hurt.
[1114.88s -> 1115.88s]  Thank you.
[1115.88s -> 1117.06s]  Santa Claus coming in.
[1117.06s -> 1118.06s]  Welcome from the North Pole, like I said.
[1119.06s -> 1121.06s]  Throwing the heavy over almost.
[1121.06s -> 1122.06s]  And he's going right for the heavy.
[1122.06s -> 1125.06s]  Two of the biggest guys in here right now.
[1125.06s -> 1126.06s]  Santa and the heavy.
[1126.06s -> 1128.06s]  Looks like Captain Crunch might be going out.
[1128.06s -> 1130.06s]  Earthworm Jim had a chance there.
[1130.06s -> 1131.06s]  But the heavy stopped it.
[1131.06s -> 1134.06s]  He gets a belly-to-belly suplex for his trouble.
[1134.06s -> 1136.06s]  And so does the captain.
[1136.06s -> 1137.42s]  Wow.
[1137.42s -> 1138.42s]  That last couple minutes was pretty ridiculous.
[1138.42s -> 1144.42s]  And it's only going to get more ridiculous seeing as how we still have four people left that need to come in.
[1144.42s -> 1153.42s]  We have 17, 18, 19, and then 20 is left on the table while the heavy gets on top of Mario just punching him in the face.
[1153.42s -> 1154.42s]  And Mario's been here for a while.
[1154.42s -> 1156.42s]  Earthworm Jim's been here for a while.
[1156.42s -> 1157.42s]  We just lost Mela.
[1157.42s -> 1165.42s]  Mela right before Santa came in took a massive kick to the face and flew over the top rope like I've never seen before.
[1165.42s -> 1167.42s]  He went flying.
[1167.42s -> 1169.42s]  And 10 seconds are on the clock.
[1169.42s -> 1171.42s]  Belly-to-belly suplex on Santa.
[1171.42s -> 1172.42s]  Got a punching miss.
[1172.42s -> 1174.42s]  A couple of misses there by Earthworm Jim.
[1174.42s -> 1176.42s]  Receives a clothesline for his trouble.
[1176.42s -> 1178.42s]  Heavy almost goes over.
[1178.42s -> 1180.42s]  And we've got another contestant coming in.
[1180.42s -> 1183.86s]  At number 17, it is the King.
[1183.86s -> 1184.86s]  The King is in the building.
[1184.86s -> 1185.86s]  Uh-huh.
[1185.86s -> 1186.86s]  It is Elvis.
[1186.86s -> 1192.86s]  Elvis Presley showing us some sparkles with his wonderful, wonderful getup he has here.
[1192.86s -> 1194.86s]  This is Fat Elvis.
[1194.86s -> 1197.86s]  You know, this is not like in shape handsome Elvis.
[1197.86s -> 1199.86s]  This is Elvis impersonator fat guy Elvis.
[1199.86s -> 1204.86s]  I figured that would be a little bit better if he came to the arena rather than the actual in shape one.
[1204.86s -> 1206.86s]  But Elvis Presley is in the arena.
[1206.86s -> 1207.86s]  He's in the building.
[1207.86s -> 1208.86s]  King is in the building.
[1208.86s -> 1210.86s]  And there goes Earthworm Jim.
[1210.86s -> 1211.86s]  No.
[1211.86s -> 1214.86s]  Earthworm Jim, he just went straight over.
[1214.86s -> 1216.10s]  And what is Santa Claus doing?
[1216.10s -> 1218.10s]  Santa Claus is picking up Mario.
[1218.10s -> 1221.10s]  Santa Claus just threw him over the top with no effort at all.
[1221.10s -> 1225.27s]  He picked him up like a baby and then just dropped him over the top rope.
[1225.27s -> 1226.27s]  That was insane.
[1226.27s -> 1228.27s]  And nobody was able to do that.
[1228.27s -> 1233.27s]  So many people tried to throw Mario out, but it just didn't work because he was essentially too heavy.
[1233.27s -> 1235.27s]  Santa Claus ain't going to mess around.
[1235.27s -> 1238.27s]  Santa Claus is like seven feet tall, so that does not bother him really at all.
[1238.27s -> 1242.27s]  And Elvis here looks like Captain Crunch might be trying to set up something, pushing him out of the ring.
[1242.27s -> 1244.27s]  Elvis is going to be gone right before he came out.
[1244.27s -> 1245.27s]  He's gone.
[1245.27s -> 1249.27s]  Elvis is gone within a minute of coming in.
[1249.27s -> 1253.27s]  And now there are three and we are coming down to the final three people.
[1253.27s -> 1257.27s]  And one of those final people is going to be in a towel.
[1257.27s -> 1258.45s]  Apparently forgot to put clothes on.
[1258.45s -> 1260.45s]  Probably just got out of the shower.
[1260.45s -> 1264.45s]  And it doesn't care that he's almost totally naked, but that's fine.
[1264.45s -> 1266.45s]  Showing off some of his fireworks.
[1266.45s -> 1268.45s]  That is, of course, Burger Boy.
[1268.45s -> 1269.45s]  Number 18.
[1269.45s -> 1271.45s]  This is a fantastic position to be in.
[1271.45s -> 1273.45s]  He is one of the final two.
[1273.45s -> 1276.45s]  And right at the moment, right as he comes in, the heavy is gone.
[1276.45s -> 1278.82s]  Santa Claus eliminates the heavy.
[1278.82s -> 1281.82s]  Santa Claus just tossing everybody out left and right.
[1281.82s -> 1283.82s]  Nobody has a chance against Santa Claus.
[1283.82s -> 1285.82s]  This is unbelievable.
[1285.82s -> 1288.82s]  There are three now in the ring with two more to come in.
[1288.82s -> 1290.82s]  Captain Crunch, Santa Claus, and Burger Boy.
[1290.82s -> 1292.82s]  And they are double teaming Burger Boy right now.
[1292.82s -> 1296.82s]  And no, it doesn't seem like it wanted to do a little bit of false security there for Santa.
[1296.82s -> 1298.82s]  Could Captain Crunch eliminate Santa right now?
[1298.82s -> 1303.82s]  It looks like if this one guy is going to do it, no, he gets interrupted by Burger Boy.
[1303.82s -> 1305.82s]  No, Captain Crunch just barely goes out.
[1305.82s -> 1309.82s]  And we have 10 seconds before somebody else comes in.
[1309.82s -> 1311.82s]  This is crunch time.
[1311.82s -> 1313.82s]  This is crunch time.
[1313.82s -> 1317.82s]  Burger Boy is now on the offensive, but he's going to just with the skin of his teeth get it.
[1317.82s -> 1320.18s]  And here comes Jerma.
[1320.18s -> 1321.18s]  Jerma 985.
[1321.18s -> 1322.18s]  There he is.
[1322.18s -> 1326.18s]  Last time's champion, the defending champion, Jerma 985.
[1326.18s -> 1332.18s]  Looking as sexy and delicious as always coming down to the arena at this moment.
[1332.18s -> 1334.18s]  And you got to believe he wants another title.
[1334.18s -> 1339.62s]  Has another fantastic position to be in, taking Santa Claus for a ride.
[1339.62s -> 1343.62s]  And if you remember last rumble, Jerma was one of the final people.
[1343.62s -> 1346.62s]  And the last one as well, giving him a huge advantage.
[1346.62s -> 1348.62s]  And he could very well win this one again.
[1348.62s -> 1353.62s]  We could see a repeat by Jerma winning the second rumble.
[1353.62s -> 1354.62s]  It's anybody's game, though.
[1354.62s -> 1357.62s]  Santa Claus is one of the top competitors out of nowhere.
[1357.62s -> 1360.62s]  Santa Claus became the top seed.
[1360.62s -> 1362.62s]  It was going to be Captain Crunch, but he still is in it.
[1362.62s -> 1364.62s]  It was going to be Codehanger.
[1364.62s -> 1365.62s]  We just don't know.
[1365.62s -> 1367.62s]  You never know what the hell is going to happen in the Jerma rumble.
[1367.62s -> 1369.62s]  Anything could happen.
[1369.62s -> 1373.62s]  Anything could happen indeed, which the theory might be proven right here.
[1373.62s -> 1374.62s]  It is.
[1374.62s -> 1375.62s]  Jerma has been eliminated.
[1375.62s -> 1377.62s]  Jerma is not going to win this one.
[1377.62s -> 1378.62s]  No repeat for Jerma.
[1378.62s -> 1383.62s]  And the final contestant is now making their way down to the arena.
[1383.62s -> 1384.62s]  Fire and brimstone.
[1384.62s -> 1385.62s]  This looks kind of eerie.
[1385.62s -> 1388.62s]  Who could this be coming straight from hell?
[1388.62s -> 1393.31s]  The egg coming up straight from the fire of hell.
[1393.31s -> 1394.31s]  He lives in hell.
[1394.31s -> 1395.31s]  He breeds in hell.
[1395.31s -> 1398.45s]  He just, he...
[1398.45s -> 1400.39s]  What's that?
[1400.39s -> 1401.39s]  We're getting word here, guys.
[1401.39s -> 1404.39s]  Apparently, a massive commotion going on backstage.
[1404.39s -> 1406.39s]  Jerma985 is tearing backstage.
[1406.39s -> 1407.39s]  Do we have any cameras back there?
[1407.39s -> 1409.39s]  I'd like to know what he's doing back there.
[1409.39s -> 1410.63s]  That's Glooman.
[1410.63s -> 1412.81s]  That's Glooman walking to his car.
[1412.81s -> 1414.81s]  He has nothing to do with this, Jerma.
[1414.81s -> 1415.81s]  You psychopath.
[1415.81s -> 1416.81s]  What's wrong with you?
[1416.81s -> 1418.81s]  Glooman wasn't even part of the festivities today.
[1418.81s -> 1419.81s]  You didn't win.
[1419.81s -> 1420.81s]  It's too...
[1420.81s -> 1421.81s]  Jesus Christ.
[1421.81s -> 1426.11s]  Jerma is on an absolute rampage right now because he didn't win the rumble.
[1426.11s -> 1429.11s]  Get security back there right now for crying out loud.
[1429.11s -> 1431.11s]  We got action in the ring going on here.
[1431.11s -> 1432.11s]  Burger Boy is out.
[1432.11s -> 1435.11s]  Burger Boy has been eliminated by Captain Crunch,
[1435.11s -> 1437.11s]  and Santa Claus is holding up for dear life.
[1437.11s -> 1438.11s]  Santa Claus is out.
[1438.11s -> 1441.11s]  Here are your final two, the last two.
[1441.11s -> 1444.11s]  You've got Captain Crunch, and you've got the egg.
[1444.11s -> 1446.11s]  It's the battle of the breakfast.
[1446.11s -> 1448.11s]  This, nobody saw this coming.
[1448.11s -> 1451.11s]  Nobody thought that the breakfast people were going to be the ones,
[1451.11s -> 1453.11s]  the two small, five feet tall people.
[1453.11s -> 1457.35s]  I'm in shock right now, but let's get it started.
[1457.35s -> 1462.35s]  One of these two is going to be crowned new Jerma Rumble champion,
[1462.35s -> 1464.35s]  and there is no telling on which one.
[1464.35s -> 1466.35s]  Beautiful belly-to-belly suplex overhead.
[1466.35s -> 1469.35s]  Recovering from that punch was Captain Crunch,
[1469.35s -> 1471.35s]  and another scooping side slam.
[1471.35s -> 1472.35s]  Captain Crunch can taste it.
[1472.35s -> 1473.35s]  He can feel it.
[1473.35s -> 1475.35s]  I think Captain's going to make it happen.
[1475.35s -> 1476.35s]  Do we think Captain's going to make it happen?
[1476.35s -> 1477.35s]  He's going to push him on the top rope here.
[1477.35s -> 1479.35s]  Can Captain Crunch win the Jerma Rumble?
[1479.35s -> 1480.35s]  Is he going to do it?
[1480.35s -> 1482.35s]  It's so close.
[1482.35s -> 1484.35s]  No, he just barely ducks underneath it.
[1484.35s -> 1487.35s]  The egg still has a little bit of fire under his ass.
[1487.35s -> 1490.35s]  Can we see a victory here by either one of these two?
[1490.35s -> 1491.35s]  One of them will win.
[1491.35s -> 1493.35s]  The question is, which one?
[1493.35s -> 1497.35s]  And in the corner now, Captain Crunch has got the egg in the corner,
[1497.35s -> 1498.35s]  kind of where he wants him.
[1498.35s -> 1499.35s]  Let's hope something can happen.
[1499.35s -> 1500.35s]  He's going to tip him over.
[1500.35s -> 1503.35s]  Captain Crunch has got the egg on the ropes.
[1503.35s -> 1505.96s]  He didn't do it.
[1505.96s -> 1507.96s]  Oh, the egg is calling for timeout.
[1507.96s -> 1509.20s]  What a bastard.
[1509.20s -> 1512.20s]  He called for timeout, and he's going to get to his advantage.
[1512.20s -> 1513.20s]  He called for timeout.
[1513.20s -> 1515.20s]  What a disgusting cheap shot that was.
[1515.20s -> 1517.20s]  Captain Crunch was going to give him the timeout,
[1517.20s -> 1520.20s]  and I hope it does not make Captain Crunch lose this battle,
[1520.20s -> 1523.20s]  because that was just absolutely disgusting on the eggs part,
[1523.20s -> 1524.20s]  and the egg now is lying down.
[1524.20s -> 1525.20s]  Seems to be winded.
[1525.20s -> 1527.20s]  Captain Crunch has a chance here.
[1527.20s -> 1528.20s]  Ring that victory bell.
[1528.20s -> 1533.20s]  Captain Crunch has just won the second ever Jerma Rumble.
[1533.20s -> 1534.20s]  What a show.
[1534.20s -> 1539.13s]  I am blown away by everything here tonight,
[1539.13s -> 1541.13s]  and congratulations, Captain Crunch,
[1541.13s -> 1543.13s]  for the second ever Jerma Rumble victory,
[1543.13s -> 1545.13s]  and I'll see you guys all next time.
[1545.13s -> 1546.13s]  Thank you all so much for watching.
[1546.13s -> 1547.13s]  I really do appreciate it.
[1547.13s -> 1549.43s]  Take care, everybody.
