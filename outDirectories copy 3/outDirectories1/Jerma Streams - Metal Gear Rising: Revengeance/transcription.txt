[1.27s -> 37.07s]  What am I looking at here? I'm looking at the chat and I just see somebody's writing like pp and like pooh pooh and shit. Like what? Come on, guys. It's 2019. We're in 2019 now. Come on. We're not doing that anymore. Really? Not on my live broadcast. Not on my livestream. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I mean? All right. 2019 resolution. I'm going to stop saying at the end of every four sentences. You know what I mean?
[37.11s -> 39.53s]  I'll try. Other New Year's resolution. I am not going to say we did. We did the award for it. The word that is the it is the it is the first name. Not doing it anymore. That was fun in 2018. You know what I mean? Well, hope you had a good new year. Hopefully you're rested. Hopefully you had fun. Hopefully you were responsible. We're in 2019. So this is technically the first stream in starting in 2019 because
[84.66s -> 133.90s]  yeah, I streamed in 2019, but it started in 2018. Welcome to the first stream of the new year. And we're going to kick it off with a good one because this is Metal Gear rising. Revengeance. Is that a real word? How can you have vengeance be twice like a revengeance? Isn't vengeance just already something you do? So this is Metal Gear. Two vengences. Revenge vengeance. But anyways,
[134.30s -> 176.46s]  this is a game that's been requested a lot of times and figured because just kind of want to play something, hang out for the new year. It was either this visceral cleanup detail or back to Kenshin. We did a little poll. It was pretty close. So this did end up winning. Dermot, you need to learn to parry. You noob. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. I haven't even done anything yet. You can't make that joke until you see it happen. So what if I do really good with parries? What if I'm just
[176.54s -> 228.14s]  then you're going to look real silly in like 30 or 40 minutes, aren't you? Dermot, I just got banned from RuneScape for cheating. Well, why are you cheating? Why are you cheating in RuneScape? Don't do that. Come on. I just got, but cut that out. He learned from me. When have I ever, I don't cheat in video games. When have I ever cheated, truly cheated in a game? It hasn't happened. Safe scumming is not cheating.
[228.46s -> 267.07s]  Turn on the face cam or riot. My face cam is not even hooked up. It's sitting over here and not plugged in. So it's not going on. No, I'm not doing a face cam. Just pretend that that's me in like the fucking dentist suit. You know what I mean? The me with like the dentist thing on my mouth. That's me in there. I was going to say, uh, all right, starting off the new year. Great. We're going to start the story. This is like a four hour game, right? I'll blow through this and fucking free.
[272.08s -> 308.52s]  So I don't just give a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars from Collie Brady, 106 hours. If you're a bad, I'll do it too. Okay. Time me a happy new year. Jerma hope 2019 is a good one for you. Love from Ireland. Jerma heart. Thank you so much. Collie Brady. Thanks for your a hundred fucking dollars. A hundred. God. I didn't really touch upon on the New Year's Eve stream because I would just had to, I had to get out of there. You know, I got to get out of here, but totally shit guys.
[308.52s -> 310.86s]  You guys are fucking incredible. Thank you. So let's start metal gear rising. I've got a controller plugged in. Does that mean I'm bad? New game. Normal, easy. I'm not going to play it on easy. I'm not playing this game on heart. Okay. Why would I play on heart? No, I'm not going to already ruin the stream. Normal. Hard with a face cam. I'm not going to play on heart. I don't play gay. I don't do this on heart. The developers designed an experience and here's how people design video games guys from some
[349.74s -> 382.14s]  body that's in the industry. You know, I died. I've had my hand in it a few times. Normal is how all the developers, all the programmers on people like that are working on computers of the design. This is the game that they wanted you to play. They made this this way. Easy is all right. Like you, like it's, you don't have to like really worry about it. Just enjoy it and press X a bunch of times and you'll be fine. They made this for the super humans. Hard. This is the way the game,
[382.14s -> 421.50s]  it's like times two speed from my understanding. When you put the game on hard, enemies are at times two speed, times two health and times two damage. I don't want to do that. Bullshit. You just suck. Hey, I beat, I beat fucking dancer. First try dark souls three. I beat flame lurker. First try. I beat Jevil. First try. So excuse me. I mean, I did, I did lose to pinwheel like 30 times, but that's because I was like fucking, I had like a headache that day. I'm doing, I already did it. It's normal. That's fine. I don't, you can call. I'm playing on normal.
[421.50s -> 434.18s]  Look, if it's too easy for me, I'll go back. I'll go. I'm just going to play on normal. I want to, I want to enjoy the game the way that the violent the developers begin with a quick warmup. Shall we? All right.
[439.18s -> 441.18s]  Is it really that much different?
[441.18s -> 483.26s]  Am I a chicken? No, it's going to be fine. If it's too easy. Look, I can just go like this and turn it on. Look at, look at this options. Hard can be turned on. What? Right? Hard on. It's not that big of a deal. All right. Our right trigger is ninja run. This is kind of cool.
[490.42s -> 507.43s]  Swinging your blade while dashing, for example, or striking your foe. I know, I know. Everybody's already saying that that's me in the corner over there. And that's funny, but not really. That feels fluid. Is this one of those fluid games? It feels like a fluid game.
[512.55s -> 536.99s]  Why would I need to parry when I can just do this? Can I play through the whole game doing this? He's already bad. I just turned on the game and I learned how to run.
[541.54s -> 545.71s]  I just learned how to run. Can I have like even five seconds?
[550.62s -> 555.62s]  So bad. Oh my god. I'm so glad I'm not doing this on hard.
[556.62s -> 560.79s]  What is it? What button is it? Oh, I got hit.
[592.90s -> 597.46s]  He thinks there's a block button.
[597.46s -> 602.46s]  Oh, is there a dodge? See, look at this. Look.
[607.46s -> 611.46s]  Light attacks on your own in the same direction. Oh boy. Thanks for coming to the stream, guys.
[613.46s -> 614.46s]  I'll see you next time.
[614.46s -> 627.26s]  Push left stick in the direction of an enemy attack and press X at this perfect moment to use the HF blade to parry your foe.
[628.26s -> 638.21s]  Like, they're talking about like this, right? Left stick, not trigger.
[639.21s -> 651.50s]  I don't walk up. Okay, I see. In the direction of an enemy attack, so it can be left, right, up, down. Hold left trigger.
[657.60s -> 689.17s]  How long am I supposed to do this for? I think I got him. When am I supposed to stop doing this? Does he have a health bar?
[698.34s -> 703.48s]  Oh, all right. He's dead. Hey, put that guy in a stew.
[715.48s -> 717.48s]  This guy's fucked.
[721.48s -> 724.48s]  Carefully aim your strike. Okay.
[727.48s -> 730.48s]  Is there a dodge roll? Is it the Raze? Game of the Year!
[731.48s -> 734.72s]  All right, let's parry. Yeah, I got it.
[736.72s -> 741.22s]  Don't do that to me. Camera? Oh, what the fuck's with the camera? I heard that was a complaint in the game.
[746.49s -> 748.49s]  I want his brain. I want his brain. Give me his brain.
[751.14s -> 765.95s]  That's kind of insane. How am I supposed to do that? Do I get more points if I do it like 40 times?
[766.95s -> 776.57s]  Hey, somebody chop up that brain and put it in a stew.
[777.57s -> 780.57s]  All right, I gotta calm the fuck down. It's been like 10 minutes.
[781.57s -> 785.57s]  I'm gonna expel all my energy in like fucking five minutes and like go to bed.
[800.26s -> 806.46s]  2019 Jerma is not as good as 2018 Jerma. It's been 15 minutes.
[818.90s -> 821.78s]  You changed.
[826.90s -> 828.90s]  There he is.
[832.90s -> 834.90s]  So, Whiz Snake.
[836.90s -> 854.34s]  He's got a snake mouth. Does he open that snake mouth up and eat something?
[855.34s -> 860.34s]  There's gonna be a joke where he eats like a hot dog or a hamburger or something. He like unhinges his jaw and eats a big piece of food, right?
[860.34s -> 862.34s]  There's a joke that has to be in the game.
[887.38s -> 889.38s]  This is a serious game.
[890.38s -> 895.38s]  By the way, Mr. Lightning Bull is the worst name. That's like a child.
[896.38s -> 900.81s]  Making up a terrible superhero name when they're playing pretend in the backyard.
[901.81s -> 903.81s]  Mr. Lightning Bull!
[908.48s -> 914.16s]  Uh oh. Boss fight.
[917.51s -> 922.89s]  It's Snake. It's Snake, isn't it?
[923.89s -> 926.32s]  This takes place like 4,000 years in the future, right?
[927.56s -> 929.56s]  There he is.
[930.56s -> 942.23s]  Nah, I'm not even cool.
[943.60s -> 946.60s]  Everyone had like a face cam on when they played this game. My screen probably was like, whoa!
[947.60s -> 966.61s]  I don't fucking care. You're so cool.
[968.61s -> 973.41s]  I can't wait to see this snake.
[988.65s -> 989.65s]  Exit.
[990.65s -> 997.56s]  Quiet compared to video game audio file.
[999.82s -> 1000.82s]  Well, it's because it's a cutscene.
[1002.96s -> 1006.80s]  The cutscenes are always way louder in every video game.
[1007.80s -> 1012.80s]  They pre-render all these out and then the guy that's making the videos has the map plus 50 DB.
[1013.80s -> 1015.80s]  And they just put them in. They don't even edit them. They don't even care.
[1016.80s -> 1022.75s]  They rendered this in Final Cut.
[1023.75s -> 1025.75s]  That's like a .mp4 and they just gave it to their boss.
[1026.75s -> 1036.38s]  Here we go.
[1037.38s -> 1040.96s]  Do I weigh 400,000 pounds?
[1042.46s -> 1043.46s]  He's just naked.
[1047.06s -> 1049.06s]  Turns out it was just a ghost. Ah, now that is what we call...
[1049.06s -> 1051.06s]  I'm not going to say the E word.
[1056.14s -> 1058.14s]  That box only costed me one dollar.
[1059.14s -> 1060.14s]  What did I get? What did I get? What did I get?
[1061.14s -> 1064.38s]  Oh, it's common, but it's okay. Cool.
[1073.92s -> 1080.34s]  I forget how to play.
[1081.52s -> 1082.52s]  You jump with A, right?
[1083.52s -> 1084.52s]  Here we go.
[1102.26s -> 1104.26s]  What if I do blade attack on somebody, right?
[1105.26s -> 1106.26s]  Gun?
[1110.26s -> 1112.26s]  I got a minimap in the corner.
[1113.26s -> 1115.43s]  Should I try to parry? Do I get points for parrying and shit?
[1116.43s -> 1118.43s]  Like, I don't understand. Do I have to parry and then...
[1119.43s -> 1120.43s]  That guy's a gun.
[1121.43s -> 1122.43s]  Should I wait?
[1123.43s -> 1124.61s]  Oops.
[1125.61s -> 1127.61s]  Alright, that guy's a gun. I'm just trying to tell me to kill him.
[1128.61s -> 1137.91s]  Cut him off! Cut him off!
[1138.91s -> 1149.70s]  You can do it, but why is it not coming off all of his body parts?
[1149.70s -> 1158.43s]  Got it. Parry.
[1160.43s -> 1169.76s]  It's going to be really easy to kill this guy.
[1170.76s -> 1181.22s]  Hold on. Stay right there.
[1195.45s -> 1196.45s]  I want to parry.
[1200.38s -> 1202.38s]  Now, does it do it automatically or do I have to hold it like afterwards?
[1203.38s -> 1204.38s]  I guess not.
[1205.38s -> 1206.87s]  Perfect parry?
[1207.87s -> 1209.24s]  Of course I did.
[1210.24s -> 1212.24s]  If you can't cut through the barricade, try defense, huh?
[1213.24s -> 1214.24s]  I don't understand how to get through this.
[1215.54s -> 1216.54s]  You can't... shit.
[1217.54s -> 1218.54s]  Nah, that's it. I'm out of here, guys. Thanks.
[1219.54s -> 1229.30s]  I don't fucking know how to do this.
[1235.53s -> 1236.53s]  What if it was just left...
[1241.35s -> 1242.35s]  Here it comes.
[1243.35s -> 1246.06s]  It's Mothra!
[1247.37s -> 1248.37s]  No, that's a Metal Gear, isn't it? That's Metal Gear...
[1249.37s -> 1251.37s]  Wait, don't tell me that's Metal Gear Rising.
[1252.37s -> 1253.37s]  No, that's the name of this game.
[1254.37s -> 1255.37s]  That's Metal Gear Ray.
[1256.80s -> 1257.80s]  It's Metal Gear Ray, right?
[1258.80s -> 1259.80s]  I know these. I've played these.
[1260.80s -> 1271.98s]  This is the gear check to determine if I can play the game or not.
[1274.73s -> 1287.04s]  I don't care.
[1299.35s -> 1300.35s]  I'll just let him go.
[1315.22s -> 1316.22s]  I thought somebody sucked him from the other side.
[1331.18s -> 1332.49s]  So you're Jack.
[1333.49s -> 1335.49s]  What do you want with the Prime Minister?
[1336.49s -> 1337.49s]  I want him dead.
[1338.49s -> 1340.82s]  Nothing personal, of course.
[1341.82s -> 1342.82s]  That's Winston's voice actor.
[1343.82s -> 1345.82s]  Africa's just getting a bit too peaceful.
[1346.82s -> 1347.82s]  What?
[1349.57s -> 1351.57s]  Business ain't been the same since they shut down SOP.
[1352.57s -> 1356.77s]  A clean break from the war economy.
[1357.77s -> 1359.77s]  Some of us like that economy.
[1360.77s -> 1362.77s]  How's an honest warmonger supposed to make a living?
[1363.77s -> 1364.77s]  This is your answer.
[1368.77s -> 1371.10s]  What does he say?
[1372.10s -> 1373.10s]  Science is the most necessary emotion of all things.
[1374.10s -> 1375.10s]  What's his dumb voice line?
[1376.10s -> 1381.26s]  I won't. Not while he's still useful.
[1382.26s -> 1384.52s]  So long.
[1387.82s -> 1389.82s]  You get back here. I'm going to one, two, three, one, two, three you.
[1391.82s -> 1396.24s]  I'm going to one, two, three, X, one, two, three, Y. Just you wait.
[1397.24s -> 1404.75s]  All right, I'm so pumped up for this.
[1405.75s -> 1408.72s]  Look at the legs.
[1409.72s -> 1412.72s]  One, two, three, one, two, three.
[1413.72s -> 1414.72s]  Got it.
[1420.57s -> 1421.57s]  One. I didn't get it.
[1422.57s -> 1423.87s]  I didn't get one, two, three.
[1424.87s -> 1425.87s]  One, two, three.
[1426.87s -> 1427.87s]  One, two, three.
[1428.87s -> 1433.18s]  Okay, get out, get out.
[1450.62s -> 1451.62s]  Don't do more than that.
[1458.17s -> 1459.17s]  What am I doing?
[1460.17s -> 1462.17s]  I'm just making somebody's YouTuber logo from like 2014.
[1463.17s -> 1477.53s]  My logo.
[1481.71s -> 1487.94s]  The left leg.
[1488.94s -> 1491.91s]  Yeah, I understand everybody.
[1491.91s -> 1492.91s]  Well, that was his left leg.
[1493.91s -> 1494.91s]  I'm talking about his left leg.
[1495.91s -> 1496.91s]  What the hell are you doing?
[1504.34s -> 1505.34s]  That hit me. Stupid game.
[1517.53s -> 1518.53s]  Harry?
[1520.54s -> 1523.12s]  Can I actually carry his legs?
[1524.12s -> 1528.05s]  This is only for regular monsters.
[1529.05s -> 1530.05s]  All right, I'll try.
[1531.93s -> 1537.78s]  I'll carry this leg of Ryan, okay?
[1538.78s -> 1539.78s]  There you go.
[1556.23s -> 1560.54s]  What a game.
[1561.54s -> 1562.54s]  Oh, what a god of a gamer.
[1564.10s -> 1565.10s]  Not really. I'm going to really focus on that.
[1566.10s -> 1567.10s]  Like they do in the WWF.
[1568.10s -> 1569.10s]  I'm going to focus on the leg that is in the brace.
[1570.10s -> 1578.32s]  Maybe I should just get him bolted.
[1580.97s -> 1581.97s]  Get bolted legs.
[1582.97s -> 1588.43s]  Okay, but you keep doing that.
[1592.36s -> 1593.36s]  Turn his other elephant foot into...
[1594.36s -> 1595.36s]  Yeah.
[1596.36s -> 1597.36s]  Got this.
[1598.36s -> 1602.86s]  What? Yeah, I can just carry everything?
[1603.86s -> 1609.78s]  I'll carry.
[1610.78s -> 1611.78s]  Okay, I'm going to carry whatever he's doing right here.
[1624.28s -> 1625.28s]  Oh, I did get it.
[1626.28s -> 1627.28s]  Okay, I didn't.
[1628.71s -> 1629.71s]  All right, that's good to know.
[1631.40s -> 1634.82s]  Whoa.
[1640.73s -> 1641.73s]  I don't think I can carry that.
[1645.59s -> 1647.79s]  YB?
[1648.79s -> 1649.79s]  Oh, do I tap this?
[1650.79s -> 1657.34s]  Because the rock music...
[1660.38s -> 1661.38s]  Picking him up and swinging him around.
[1662.38s -> 1663.38s]  I just so longed him.
[1664.38s -> 1665.38s]  I did the so long Bowser thing.
[1672.12s -> 1673.12s]  I'm going to do desktop testing.
[1682.80s -> 1685.45s]  B.
[1689.01s -> 1690.01s]  It's always a B, guys.
[1691.01s -> 1692.31s]  Don't you understand?
[1693.31s -> 1697.62s]  Where's my level ups?
[1698.62s -> 1700.62s]  Any normal human B would have puked by now.
[1708.01s -> 1709.01s]  There, get him.
[1710.01s -> 1711.01s]  All right, it's a chase sequence.
[1716.60s -> 1717.60s]  Use your ninja run.
[1718.60s -> 1719.60s]  Probably, that's what I'm doing.
[1724.17s -> 1725.17s]  Oh, I did...
[1726.17s -> 1727.17s]  Just come on.
[1728.17s -> 1729.17s]  That would have been awesome if I accidentally perfectly timed that.
[1736.94s -> 1737.94s]  I thought it was...
[1738.94s -> 1739.94s]  I thought it was a climb up sequence or something.
[1743.35s -> 1747.41s]  You can't give me shit for that.
[1748.41s -> 1749.41s]  Actually, it would have been faster if I just walked up a part of the stairs.
[1754.17s -> 1755.92s]  Here's Ray again.
[1756.92s -> 1757.92s]  There, you cheat.
[1758.92s -> 1759.92s]  It still works.
[1759.92s -> 1765.22s]  Hurry up and kill the big monster so I can get some scales from the Monster Hunter World reference.
[1766.22s -> 1767.22s]  Do I block this?
[1770.77s -> 1771.77s]  Okay.
[1772.77s -> 1773.77s]  I have to slide underneath it?
[1774.77s -> 1775.77s]  Oh no, okay.
[1776.77s -> 1777.77s]  Is this a jump rope?
[1784.38s -> 1795.10s]  Do I have to jump over that?
[1796.10s -> 1797.10s]  I'm stuck in the ground.
[1798.10s -> 1799.10s]  What is this?
[1800.10s -> 1801.10s]  What the hell is this?
[1802.10s -> 1803.85s]  What?
[1804.85s -> 1805.85s]  What the fuck just happened?
[1810.67s -> 1812.10s]  Get it!
[1813.10s -> 1819.08s]  I get to see what he really looks like.
[1820.08s -> 1824.97s]  Perfect parry.
[1828.19s -> 1829.19s]  Just call me Perfect Parry...
[1830.19s -> 1831.19s]  Paul.
[1832.19s -> 1833.19s]  I was going to say something else.
[1850.69s -> 1851.69s]  I've got to...
[1854.27s -> 1856.28s]  Um...
[1857.28s -> 1858.28s]  What?
[1859.28s -> 1860.97s]  Hold the right trigger.
[1861.97s -> 1863.98s]  Am I supposed to be swinging at these?
[1865.54s -> 1868.18s]  What am I looking at?
[1869.18s -> 1871.64s]  What am I supposed to be doing?
[1873.20s -> 1874.20s]  Oh, ninja run.
[1879.47s -> 1880.47s]  Okay.
[1881.47s -> 1895.00s]  Whatever.
[1896.00s -> 1901.74s]  He starts fucking crunching me and my blood and guts are everywhere.
[1902.74s -> 1904.74s]  My legs are ripped off and I'm like fucking mangled and shit.
[1905.74s -> 1915.30s]  I was trying to do a thing.
[1918.84s -> 1919.84s]  Wait.
[1923.51s -> 1925.51s]  Why is title so close there?
[1926.51s -> 1927.51s]  I was just being a dickhead.
[1928.51s -> 1929.51s]  Lost on the first level.
[1929.51s -> 1930.51s]  I was fucking around.
[1930.51s -> 1931.51s]  I was like jumping.
[1932.51s -> 1933.51s]  Sorry, I've played...
[1933.51s -> 1934.51s]  Yeah, guys, guys.
[1934.51s -> 1935.51s]  Relax.
[1935.51s -> 1938.51s]  I've played this game on iPad like ten times.
[1938.51s -> 1941.99s]  This is the...
[1941.99s -> 1942.99s]  I'm sorry.
[1942.99s -> 1945.99s]  I'm playing the most downloaded free game on the App Store right now.
[1946.99s -> 1962.36s]  Oops.
[1962.36s -> 1963.36s]  All right.
[1963.36s -> 1964.60s]  So we're going to stay over here.
[1969.81s -> 1972.06s]  It's the next big...
[1972.06s -> 1976.24s]  Watch out.
[1976.24s -> 1984.71s]  It's the music.
[1984.71s -> 1985.71s]  All the way down.
[1985.71s -> 1991.18s]  That's not good.
[1991.18s -> 1992.18s]  My god.
[1992.18s -> 1993.18s]  Sell that iPad.
[1993.18s -> 1998.23s]  He even died three times and I got a B.
[2001.52s -> 2007.09s]  He's still running away with this guy.
[2008.09s -> 2012.59s]  B for bad.
[2013.59s -> 2018.69s]  How about B for banned for life from the channel?
[2018.69s -> 2020.31s]  Got him.
[2020.31s -> 2021.31s]  He's done.
[2021.31s -> 2040.83s]  That's what I would do with this all day.
[2040.83s -> 2044.07s]  I would just go to a giant open field and just slide around like that.
[2045.07s -> 2048.89s]  Until I was at the point of physical exhaustion.
[2049.89s -> 2052.22s]  I would do it every day.
[2052.22s -> 2054.22s]  That's what I would do for a living.
[2063.34s -> 2065.34s]  I was about to just run off the side and just...
[2066.34s -> 2067.34s]  I don't do the...
[2067.34s -> 2068.34s]  That's just 2019.
[2068.34s -> 2069.34s]  We don't make those jokes.
[2084.87s -> 2087.90s]  What?
[2087.90s -> 2088.90s]  2v1 fight right now?
[2093.85s -> 2094.85s]  Remember, this next boss fight is easy.
[2094.85s -> 2095.85s]  If you don't beat it, you're bad.
[2096.85s -> 2098.66s]  Just let me play.
[2099.66s -> 2100.66s]  Enjoy the game.
[2101.66s -> 2107.10s]  I was looking away for a second.
[2107.10s -> 2108.10s]  I thought they were just...
[2108.10s -> 2109.10s]  That's what was actually happening.
[2109.10s -> 2111.10s]  Good things more is done for us.
[2112.10s -> 2114.10s]  Why don't we ever hear speeches about that?
[2115.10s -> 2118.10s]  Jobs, technology, a common purpose.
[2122.47s -> 2124.47s]  I'm just so unenthusiastic.
[2127.47s -> 2130.80s]  You ain't listening.
[2131.80s -> 2146.58s]  If I got in...
[2148.27s -> 2150.27s]  All we're saying...
[2150.27s -> 2152.27s]  Give war a chance!
[2154.27s -> 2163.70s]  No!
[2172.82s -> 2174.82s]  That was crazy.
[2175.99s -> 2186.77s]  Okay.
[2186.77s -> 2187.77s]  Let's go!
[2188.77s -> 2195.81s]  That was a powerful swing.
[2196.81s -> 2200.26s]  Beat Sam or bad streamer.
[2200.26s -> 2201.26s]  I'm gonna try.
[2201.26s -> 2202.26s]  Just relax.
[2208.92s -> 2209.92s]  I love how it's like a game remote.
[2214.74s -> 2215.74s]  I'm gonna wait for him to do something.
[2216.74s -> 2220.03s]  We're both playing the same game.
[2220.03s -> 2221.03s]  He's waiting to parry me.
[2222.03s -> 2223.03s]  This is just...
[2223.03s -> 2224.66s]  Nice PvP fight.
[2224.66s -> 2225.66s]  I'm gonna taunt.
[2226.66s -> 2234.81s]  See?
[2234.81s -> 2235.81s]  God damn it.
[2235.81s -> 2236.81s]  I shouldn't have struck first.
[2238.81s -> 2241.46s]  Let's see.
[2241.46s -> 2242.46s]  That wasn't even...
[2242.46s -> 2243.46s]  I thought it was a cut scene.
[2243.46s -> 2244.46s]  I thought it was a cut scene.
[2247.40s -> 2248.40s]  I gotta parry more than once.
[2248.40s -> 2249.40s]  Okay.
[2251.09s -> 2252.09s]  It's like parry, parry, parry.
[2270.06s -> 2272.06s]  I gotta parry individually.
[2273.06s -> 2275.06s]  So it's parry, parry, parry.
[2276.06s -> 2279.48s]  I'm gonna try to get that right.
[2283.48s -> 2284.48s]  He's about to lose to Sam.
[2287.48s -> 2291.92s]  So, okay.
[2291.92s -> 2293.10s]  I get it.
[2293.10s -> 2295.10s]  We just have to actually just up the...
[2298.10s -> 2299.10s]  Okay.
[2299.10s -> 2300.10s]  I'm probably...
[2300.10s -> 2301.10s]  I got...
[2301.10s -> 2302.10s]  I'm .1% streamer.
[2303.10s -> 2312.59s]  Hahaha.
[2325.98s -> 2326.98s]  Losing to the easiest bot...
[2326.98s -> 2327.98s]  Well, I'm learning how to parry.
[2340.76s -> 2342.76s]  I don't even need my game genie.
[2343.76s -> 2372.58s]  There's my opening.
[2372.58s -> 2373.58s]  There's my opening.
[2373.58s -> 2374.58s]  There's my opening.
[2374.58s -> 2376.21s]  He's shooting.
[2376.21s -> 2377.21s]  Oh no.
[2377.21s -> 2378.21s]  He has one of those action figure things.
[2378.21s -> 2379.21s]  Yeah, I think he's supposed to lose here.
[2379.21s -> 2380.21s]  This is a joke.
[2380.21s -> 2381.21s]  You guys were baiting me.
[2388.50s -> 2390.70s]  He's supposed to lose here.
[2394.14s -> 2395.14s]  Everyone's talking about how bad I am.
[2421.94s -> 2422.94s]  Bleed on him.
[2422.94s -> 2423.94s]  Hahaha.
[2427.94s -> 2430.94s]  Imagine this is just an elaborate game over screen.
[2436.81s -> 2437.81s]  Oh, you're gonna raise the blade up too high
[2437.81s -> 2438.81s]  and you're gonna get caught in the ceiling.
[2439.81s -> 2441.82s]  Oh, you can't be outside
[2441.82s -> 2442.82s]  because it's right up.
[2442.82s -> 2443.82s]  Like Vampire, right?
[2443.82s -> 2444.82s]  Lucky devil.
[2445.82s -> 2453.90s]  Sit up a little too high
[2453.90s -> 2454.90s]  and get stuck in the ceiling.
[2454.90s -> 2455.90s]  He's just like...
[2456.90s -> 2457.90s]  Kept you waiting, huh?
[2460.49s -> 2461.49s]  That snake!
[2461.49s -> 2462.49s]  The snake's behind the wheel right there.
[2463.49s -> 2464.49s]  What a fun cameo.
[2465.49s -> 2474.66s]  That snake before the cigars.
[2474.66s -> 2476.66s]  This takes place like 400 years ago, right?
[2477.66s -> 2494.07s]  Is this a blind playthrough?
[2495.07s -> 2496.76s]  I...
[2496.76s -> 2498.76s]  never played this game before.
[2500.76s -> 2516.89s]  Metal Gear Solid V is the first one, right?
[2518.89s -> 2520.06s]  Yeah.
[2520.06s -> 2522.06s]  The story of Metal Gear Kingdom Hearts.
[2523.06s -> 2527.22s]  They sell a product that you can download
[2527.22s -> 2528.22s]  into your brain, though.
[2528.22s -> 2530.23s]  I tried to...
[2530.23s -> 2536.66s]  chat, I'm confused.
[2536.66s -> 2537.66s]  Which one is Snake?
[2538.66s -> 2539.66s]  Oh, well...
[2540.66s -> 2542.66s]  I'm sure that it'll pop up eventually.
[2543.66s -> 2546.94s]  So I got...
[2548.76s -> 2549.76s]  Chapter...
[2549.76s -> 2551.06s]  Difficulty Normal.
[2551.06s -> 2552.06s]  Chapter Combat.
[2552.06s -> 2553.06s]  BB.
[2553.06s -> 2554.06s]  Time.
[2554.06s -> 2555.06s]  BP.
[2556.56s -> 2557.56s]  Rank B.
[2557.56s -> 2558.56s]  Bonus B.
[2558.56s -> 2560.93s]  How many Bs are on total BP?
[2561.93s -> 2565.60s]  Alright.
[2565.60s -> 2571.94s]  A whole lot of Bs on the screen.
[2571.94s -> 2581.79s]  This is gonna be kind of a fun game.
[2582.79s -> 2585.06s]  Three weeks later.
[2589.56s -> 2590.56s]  Oh, I know what this is.
[2590.56s -> 2592.56s]  This is the lolly with it all.
[2606.79s -> 2607.79s]  Come on.
[2607.79s -> 2609.79s]  I make a Metal Gear reference?
[2609.79s -> 2612.79s]  While playing Metal Gear and I get a bunch of question marks and chat?
[2613.79s -> 2614.79s]  Huh?
[2627.00s -> 2633.00s]  Oh, nooooooooooo don't.
[2636.74s -> 2637.74s]  Ah, okay, we're good.
[2642.34s -> 2644.34s]  So which one of these guys is the secret bad guy?
[2648.78s -> 2650.78s]  He looks like a secret bad guy.
[2650.78s -> 2651.78s]  He just does.
[2651.78s -> 2658.78s]  Yes, enemy cyborgs should provide plenty of MCFC electrolytes once you slice them open and extract their fluids.
[2660.78s -> 2663.78s]  Alright, gain like 50 pounds and then do what Dr. Eggman costed.
[2663.78s -> 2665.78s]  And their left hands, if you please.
[2665.78s -> 2667.78s]  Nobody wants the Eggman haircut.
[2667.78s -> 2668.78s]  Why? I don't get it.
[2668.78s -> 2672.78s]  That combat data stored on holographic memory typically located in the left hand.
[2672.78s -> 2673.78s]  You know when I get older?
[2673.78s -> 2675.78s]  Yeah, I really want like the Eggman.
[2675.78s -> 2676.78s]  That data is very valuable.
[2676.78s -> 2677.78s]  The Dr. Robotnik.
[2677.78s -> 2678.78s]  You know what I mean?
[2678.78s -> 2679.78s]  So this is the guy you upgraded with?
[2682.78s -> 2683.78s]  No, fuck that, man.
[2683.78s -> 2690.78s]  See, I'll fold that hair up and put a bunch of grease on it and fold it over the top of your head.
[2690.78s -> 2691.78s]  That would look better.
[2693.78s -> 2695.78s]  Grow that out really, really fast.
[2695.78s -> 2696.78s]  Yeah.
[2696.78s -> 2697.78s]  Yeah.
[2697.78s -> 2698.78s]  Yeah.
[2698.78s -> 2699.78s]  Yeah.
[2699.78s -> 2700.78s]  Yeah.
[2700.78s -> 2701.78s]  Yeah.
[2701.78s -> 2702.78s]  Yeah.
[2702.78s -> 2703.78s]  Yeah.
[2703.78s -> 2704.78s]  Yeah.
[2705.78s -> 2713.87s]  Grow that out really long and then fold the whole thing over and then style it.
[2717.87s -> 2718.87s]  I mean, no, it wouldn't.
[2722.87s -> 2726.87s]  Only one person has ever made that haircut look good.
[2726.87s -> 2727.87s]  And it was Hulk Hogan.
[2729.87s -> 2731.87s]  If you are not Hulk Hogan, don't have that haircut.
[2739.03s -> 2748.03s]  Or Ben Franklin.
[2748.03s -> 2757.03s]  Only two people in history have made that haircut look good.
[2757.03s -> 2759.03s]  Hulk Hogan and Ben Franklin.
[2772.71s -> 2785.58s]  All right, I'm ready.
[2785.58s -> 2790.84s]  So stop the organization here.
[2790.84s -> 2793.84s]  I got upgrades from Dr. Eggman.
[2793.84s -> 2794.84s]  New suit.
[2794.84s -> 2796.46s]  New weapon.
[2796.46s -> 2798.46s]  Three weeks later.
[2798.46s -> 2817.02s]  The way we drop it.
[2817.02s -> 2822.42s]  I was about to do the da-da-da noise, but no.
[2822.42s -> 2823.42s]  It's not anymore.
[2823.42s -> 2824.42s]  It's 2019.
[2824.42s -> 2836.28s]  All right.
[2836.28s -> 2838.03s]  What do I get for it?
[2838.03s -> 2839.03s]  I got an A for that one?
[2839.03s -> 2840.03s]  Did I get S?
[2840.03s -> 2849.03s]  Let's go in.
[2849.03s -> 2851.03s]  Can I run up walls in this game?
[2851.03s -> 2852.03s]  No.
[2852.03s -> 2853.03s]  Return it.
[2853.03s -> 2855.68s]  Cut the tree.
[2855.68s -> 2856.68s]  Cut the tree.
[2856.68s -> 2857.68s]  Cut the tree.
[2857.68s -> 2858.68s]  Oh my god.
[2858.68s -> 2859.68s]  Relax.
[2859.68s -> 2868.02s]  Cut the tree.
[2868.02s -> 2870.02s]  Can I do it vertically?
[2870.02s -> 2871.58s]  Okay, cool.
[2871.58s -> 2874.58s]  I'm so glad you guys told me to cut the trees.
[2874.58s -> 2877.10s]  Can I cut?
[2877.10s -> 2878.10s]  Hold on a second.
[2878.10s -> 2894.00s]  Whoa.
[2894.00s -> 2895.00s]  That's cool.
[2895.00s -> 2902.38s]  Combat manual.
[2902.38s -> 2906.06s]  What is it?
[2906.06s -> 2907.06s]  Codec.
[2907.06s -> 2908.06s]  What?
[2908.06s -> 2909.06s]  Back.
[2909.06s -> 2910.06s]  Who am I calling here?
[2910.06s -> 2911.06s]  Kevin?
[2911.06s -> 2912.06s]  Looks like a war zone out here.
[2912.06s -> 2913.06s]  The palace cleared out quick when Dolzayev's men showed up.
[2913.06s -> 2914.06s]  The streets got pretty hot after that.
[2914.06s -> 2915.06s]  Destroy cat.
[2915.06s -> 2916.06s]  We're definitely going to see a few civilian casualties here.
[2916.06s -> 2917.06s]  Luckily, it looks like most of them got out of the city before things got bad.
[2917.06s -> 2918.06s]  What do you mean cut the cat?
[2918.06s -> 2919.06s]  They basically got control of the entire town and are using the refinery as their HQ.
[2919.06s -> 2920.06s]  And that's why we're hitting the plant.
[2920.06s -> 2921.06s]  Keep in mind, those cyborgs are contractors.
[2921.06s -> 2922.06s]  For most of these guys, this is just a job.
[2922.06s -> 2923.06s]  There's a cat on the beach.
[2923.06s -> 2924.06s]  In theory, once you eliminate their commanding officer, they should scatter pretty quickly.
[2924.06s -> 2925.06s]  Okay.
[2925.06s -> 2926.06s]  Good to know.
[2926.06s -> 2953.33s]  There's a cat on the beach.
[2953.33s -> 2954.33s]  I don't see a cat.
[2954.33s -> 2959.02s]  Oh, I see a cat.
[2960.02s -> 2965.02s]  So the joke here is you want me to hold L2 and cut up the cat.
[2965.02s -> 2967.02s]  Why would I do that?
[2967.02s -> 2968.84s]  Whoops-a-daisy.
[2968.84s -> 2969.84s]  Good thing you just dodged it.
[2969.84s -> 2970.84s]  Because I hit right stick.
[2970.84s -> 2971.84s]  Good dodge.
[2971.84s -> 2972.84s]  You deserve it.
[2972.84s -> 2974.84s]  I'm not going to cut up the cat.
[2974.84s -> 2976.84s]  Why would I do something like that?
[2976.84s -> 2982.43s]  No.
[2982.43s -> 2983.43s]  That cat lives.
[2983.43s -> 2987.23s]  Okay.
[2987.23s -> 2988.23s]  All right.
[2988.23s -> 2989.23s]  Get me away from that cat before I do it.
[2989.23s -> 2994.67s]  I'm not cutting up the cat.
[2994.67s -> 2997.19s]  No.
[2997.19s -> 2998.19s]  Somebody else probably did that.
[2998.19s -> 3000.19s]  And you want to see somebody else cut up the cat.
[3000.19s -> 3001.19s]  But I want that cat to live.
[3001.19s -> 3002.19s]  Because Resident Evil 4 taught me.
[3002.19s -> 3003.19s]  Protect the animal.
[3003.19s -> 3004.19s]  Protect the fucking animal.
[3004.19s -> 3005.19s]  What is this?
[3005.19s -> 3006.19s]  What the hell am I doing?
[3006.19s -> 3007.19s]  I just ripped out a spinal cord.
[3007.19s -> 3008.19s]  What?
[3008.19s -> 3009.19s]  I'm sorry.
[3009.19s -> 3010.19s]  It's a counterattack.
[3010.19s -> 3014.66s]  All right.
[3014.66s -> 3016.98s]  Well.
[3016.98s -> 3041.17s]  Easy as one, two, three.
[3041.17s -> 3042.17s]  That's how you eat.
[3042.17s -> 3043.17s]  Oh, I see.
[3043.17s -> 3046.01s]  Okay.
[3046.01s -> 3047.01s]  I missed.
[3047.01s -> 3049.11s]  How do they miss you miss this?
[3049.65s -> 3059.59s]  And your film eat with this body. I could take these guys with no eyes
[3060.75s -> 3064.75s]  Intel wasn't exaggerating on the cyborg count now. They didn't do this, right?
[3065.39s -> 3067.75s]  You wouldn't be able to talk like that if you had that on your jaw
[3069.15s -> 3071.15s]  The super justice like this
[3071.75s -> 3073.43s]  I mean, yeah
[3073.43s -> 3077.23s]  Like a new body. It's really really easy and cyborgs are still you
[3078.11s -> 3082.19s]  Thinking people way less risk of collateral damage than your typical UAV strike
[3082.91s -> 3088.43s]  And don't forget the PR angle nations start playing Frankenstein with their troops and the public goes nuts
[3089.15s -> 3091.55s]  PMC's on the other hand are off the ethical radar
[3092.75s -> 3096.55s]  Yeah, they still don't think I'm PMC's in official death tolls
[3096.95s -> 3101.61s]  What was the moving the cup SOP out of the picture private militaries needed a new edge on the market?
[3102.11s -> 3107.78s]  We got in a way cyborgs are just SOP troops by another name
[3109.44s -> 3111.44s]  So she doesn't spill it predictable
[3111.76s -> 3115.73s]  But it makes you wonder here comes a classic spill of John these guys
[3117.25s -> 3120.53s]  I'm not complaining. They're like walking vending machines
[3123.83s -> 3125.83s]  Vending machines full of blood
[3128.07s -> 3135.23s]  Easy there Dracula like I said, there's still people people who terrorize and take innocent lives for money
[3136.55s -> 3140.99s]  They sewed their fate when they took this job. Oh, whoa, I'm scared
[3146.74s -> 3148.74s]  Still that from Bugleberry
[3150.66s -> 3152.66s]  Yeah, he's still
[3153.06s -> 3155.88s]  Jump-scare into the camera from BF Bugleberry
[3156.58s -> 3158.42s]  You sure did
[3158.42s -> 3168.78s]  s
[3168.78s -> 3177.17s]  Storials now playable view of VR missions. All right head to the indicated waypoint straight up here
[3177.17s -> 3179.17s]  Are there any secrets? They're like secret cats over here
[3179.81s -> 3181.57s]  And it should be where?
[3181.57s -> 3184.74s]  There's got to be random secrets in this game, right?
[3185.42s -> 3195.42s]  Cut the billboard cut billboard cut billboard. All right, my god
[3196.34s -> 3207.58s]  Cool, you'll need to head inland. But first make your way through this building
[3208.20s -> 3214.68s]  Cut car cut car in half the coastline is too long and heavily gun. You must take the inland route
[3215.58s -> 3219.36s]  Cut ground. I don't want to do that
[3219.64s -> 3222.14s]  The whole the earth will cut in half
[3222.26s -> 3229.06s]  Right. This is Boris. Give me your status looks clear. No one in sight. Good. Let's recap the route
[3229.06s -> 3234.38s]  You will take as I said the enemy's HQ is in the refinery along the coastline
[3234.78s -> 3238.86s]  Dolce I have has been spotted there using satellite photography also on site
[3239.34s -> 3241.98s]  Mistral a desperado captain cut Boris
[3241.98s -> 3245.10s]  So I go through the city I cross the bridge into the old town
[3245.50s -> 3247.98s]  Then head down to the rear of the refinery keep walking
[3248.70s -> 3253.74s]  I think I'm gonna walk and be on the phone. We'll probably have a grand reception awaiting you at the old city
[3254.30s -> 3256.30s]  Do not let your guard down
[3258.45s -> 3261.84s]  All right, so I gotta get up there
[3263.42s -> 3270.59s]  Ooh chest plus one repair nano paste
[3271.71s -> 3275.71s]  I think I didn't just sprint through wait about anything can open the boxes
[3276.99s -> 3279.23s]  Oh shit, you can
[3282.02s -> 3287.58s]  Everything can just be chopped up. Thank god. I have a good cpu for this
[3289.60s -> 3291.84s]  Okay, uh, so I gotta get up there
[3293.86s -> 3296.02s]  No, wait, there's more boxes now. This is couch
[3296.98s -> 3299.28s]  It's gotta be perfect right down the middle cut
[3300.67s -> 3306.43s]  Fuck I didn't realize that was gonna happen. Right it if you ever get lost use augment mode to check your next objective
[3307.55s -> 3311.23s]  So now you can fit it through wait toggle ar using augment mode
[3311.47s -> 3315.23s]  You can see enemy positions and the direction in which you should head
[3315.79s -> 3318.99s]  Useful for when you cannot find your objective on the soliton radar
[3321.30s -> 3322.50s]  Hey, thanks
[3322.50s -> 3325.38s]  I probably would have been here for so long
[3325.70s -> 3329.34s]  All right, we got another uh chest here
[3329.66s -> 3331.65s]  What's that
[3331.65s -> 3334.06s]  Bp
[3334.06s -> 3339.26s]  I don't want to say but it's just so easy to say b and then p, you know what I mean from two days ago
[3339.50s -> 3343.98s]  Hostiles in the lower corridor. I see try to flank them or approach from behind
[3344.94s -> 3347.18s]  I'm not doing it. I told you i'm leaving that in 2018
[3348.22s -> 3352.37s]  All right, let's get over here and do like the fun move where you jump down and then splash them
[3354.61s -> 3357.81s]  Nice
[3357.97s -> 3359.57s]  Excellent raiden
[3359.57s -> 3365.20s]  What's out here this time i'm gonna deflect rockets and shit
[3365.76s -> 3368.32s]  Is this stealth in this game take that main thoroughfare?
[3368.72s -> 3371.60s]  You can use augment mode to see where the enemy is located
[3372.08s -> 3376.08s]  Your body analyzes radar and ir data to construct your ar display
[3377.28s -> 3380.48s]  Some civilians are still in the city. That is not good
[3381.68s -> 3385.76s]  When it flashes blue use blade mode blue blue blue black flat blade
[3385.76s -> 3390.21s]  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. What are you doing? This area is off limits
[3396.35s -> 3398.35s]  That guy's crouching too much
[3408.75s -> 3410.83s]  Oh, nice try almost got me
[3411.47s -> 3422.98s]  Can I parry the grenade?
[3429.07s -> 3431.07s]  All right, who's left you
[3431.15s -> 3435.23s]  This guy's a little different
[3435.31s -> 3436.51s]  So
[3436.51s -> 3438.51s]  Okay. All right, whatever when they're up here
[3441.61s -> 3449.84s]  Sands high restart. I killed a civilian. I did not I did no such thing. Oh, it's one of the goat things
[3450.80s -> 3461.55s]  Dodge roll
[3494.42s -> 3496.42s]  That makes things a lot easier
[3507.89s -> 3518.05s]  That guy didn't even exist like I just flipped over into me and turned into nothing
[3518.85s -> 3530.94s]  Oh, I tried to do it
[3530.94s -> 3531.90s]  What?
[3531.90s -> 3533.02s]  What?
[3533.02s -> 3534.38s]  Okay
[3534.38s -> 3549.90s]  What do I do?
[3549.90s -> 3551.90s]  Did I miss something? No, I got it
[3559.95s -> 3564.35s]  Blade wait, hold on. Wait, wait when they turn blue I have to press left. Okay
[3566.74s -> 3570.34s]  I thought you I thought what you talked about the blue up there when it was full or something
[3572.67s -> 3574.67s]  Blade mode when the symbol appears
[3575.98s -> 3580.06s]  change sub weapon
[3580.06s -> 3582.88s]  recovery
[3582.88s -> 3583.92s]  main
[3583.92s -> 3587.39s]  Okay, here's grenades
[3587.39s -> 3593.90s]  A small quantity of the substance found in cyborg and ug self-repair units that can be used to immediately restore raden's
[3594.38s -> 3596.70s]  A life gauge. Okay, so it's heads. He's a heal
[3597.66s -> 3607.57s]  And then this is a grenade
[3607.97s -> 3609.97s]  the latest in fragmentary grenades
[3610.77s -> 3612.29s]  Yeah, yeah
[3612.29s -> 3615.49s]  Uh, I get the mouse office. I just dropped the fucking mouse hole
[3617.28s -> 3621.28s]  Uh larger and heavier than a conventional grenade requires cyborg great strength to throw it
[3621.84s -> 3623.76s]  all right, so
[3623.76s -> 3625.44s]  Lb is
[3625.44s -> 3628.88s]  Equipped. Oh i'm holding it now. Okay, uh throw it
[3629.92s -> 3634.18s]  Where is it?
[3634.18s -> 3637.14s]  Well a great place to give me the tutorial for that
[3650.08s -> 3651.60s]  Okay, let's go
[3651.60s -> 3661.70s]  Oh, that was long. That was a long animation
[3664.86s -> 3666.22s]  Oh fuck
[3666.22s -> 3671.38s]  Am I supposed to be fighting both these guys the same time?
[3671.94s -> 3700.27s]  Where did this guy come from? Oh my god. I'm like getting my ass kicked here. I'm gonna like die
[3707.86s -> 3712.66s]  All right. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. What? Why is it not doing it? Did I have not enough power?
[3713.54s -> 3717.87s]  There's a guy behind me
[3717.87s -> 3723.04s]  I did hold it
[3723.04s -> 3725.04s]  Hold blade mode. That's what I was doing
[3725.68s -> 3742.83s]  All right. Sometimes I'll do it
[3743.55s -> 3745.55s]  Sometimes i'll press like up and x
[3746.83s -> 3748.83s]  What the fuck is going on
[3749.57s -> 3755.73s]  I thought it was hold it hold it when he does this he's blue. He's blue. This guy's blue right now. All right, he's blue
[3759.63s -> 3761.63s]  I hold it when he's blue
[3761.63s -> 3765.12s]  That what happened?
[3765.12s -> 3767.12s]  The screen also has to be blue
[3769.38s -> 3776.35s]  Okay
[3776.35s -> 3778.27s]  I just uh, well
[3778.27s -> 3788.06s]  Everybody's screaming at me
[3788.14s -> 3790.14s]  Do the blade mode tutorial
[3791.63s -> 3796.27s]  Well, I haven't done that yet. Is that gonna is that happen soon? They haven't like taught me this shit yet
[3796.99s -> 3811.73s]  You shouldn't see most likely an enemy data terminal. Check it out. We may be able to salvage some intel
[3813.98s -> 3815.98s]  Let me see
[3816.64s -> 3820.42s]  Not wrong is it under help
[3823.26s -> 3826.86s]  All right. Hold on a second light attack launcher during light attack strong attack
[3827.58s -> 3829.58s]  Yeah, yeah flurry kick
[3829.74s -> 3838.05s]  Let me just see these for a second heal the drop y slight pause then x y
[3841.06s -> 3843.62s]  Vr missions hold on. I know I just wait wait wait wait wait wait
[3854.74s -> 3856.82s]  Um, no, no, no, I don't want to do this yet
[3857.54s -> 3861.66s]  Let me get to like the stopping point here. I feel like it's gonna pull me out of the whole game
[3864.70s -> 3869.82s]  But I don't know all this stuff. You know what I mean? Like I how am I supposed to know all these things that I?
[3869.82s -> 3874.78s]  Have not known
[3874.78s -> 3877.58s]  Greeting you missed the terminal. Oh i'm busy looking over here
[3878.72s -> 3882.16s]  Show yourself telling people to do the thing that I didn't learn yet
[3883.12s -> 3912.70s]  All right, I got this in the hard way. Well, how else would you do it?
[3913.42s -> 3915.42s]  I need to figure it out
[3915.74s -> 3919.66s]  I can go and do that. I can do the vr thing if I really feel the need to
[3921.73s -> 3927.20s]  And you are I am I have just the final fantasy 7 monster
[3931.98s -> 3940.22s]  Interface prototype all autonomous ugs feature high level onboard artificial intelligence an additional prototyping to base enables
[3940.62s -> 3944.30s]  How big does it download? I possess an intellect 20 30 gig
[3946.06s -> 3947.66s]  You don't say
[3947.66s -> 3951.18s]  Okay, then what's the meaning of life? Why are we here?
[3955.50s -> 3958.94s]  Good bad time that pretty good. I am here to kill you
[3965.87s -> 3968.03s]  oh
[3968.03s -> 3970.03s]  My god, that hurts. That's it
[3970.59s -> 3973.39s]  Pretty simple thinking for such a mighty intellect
[3974.93s -> 3978.69s]  I may analyze orders, but I may not disobey them
[3979.09s -> 3982.61s]  Should I disobey a direct order? My memory would be wiped
[3983.25s -> 3987.97s]  I must destroy you. Is this the same actor doing the same conversation here if you can't use it
[3989.09s -> 3991.09s]  Your taunting is pointless
[3991.55s -> 3993.55s]  Exterminate
[3993.57s -> 3997.73s]  See how badly I need to do the uh, vr tutorial we'll find out real quick
[3998.93s -> 4012.93s]  Who goes first?
[4018.70s -> 4024.78s]  Probably should have done that
[4029.81s -> 4031.81s]  No, target him what whoa
[4035.44s -> 4043.33s]  You will die as all of these tools get up here I get up there too
[4044.53s -> 4047.65s]  What's he doing? What's that move? He did the blink could I
[4048.99s -> 4050.99s]  Oh, he howled in fucking ads
[4051.47s -> 4059.22s]  Can I have a pair of the grenades?
[4059.30s -> 4063.97s]  Get this away
[4070.66s -> 4075.65s]  Back down here
[4075.65s -> 4077.65s]  Exterminate your consciousness
[4080.29s -> 4094.62s]  And ready here we go get it that didn't work that didn't work. I thought I could do something there
[4097.90s -> 4111.57s]  I really thought that was gonna work. Do it
[4141.81s -> 4146.29s]  Stop doing that. What the hell is going on turn that off?
[4156.05s -> 4159.17s]  I'm trying to all right. I'm getting confused with the animations here
[4159.89s -> 4161.89s]  Sometimes i'll do up an x
[4161.89s -> 4163.89s]  I must have to not be moving right?
[4164.53s -> 4167.79s]  Because sometimes i'll do it and he won't parry
[4174.43s -> 4180.42s]  All right. I I held it. I swear to god I did I promise you
[4196.93s -> 4221.57s]  Where is he? Where the fuck is he? Where'd he go? Did I not get it?
[4222.75s -> 4224.75s]  Superficial damage
[4228.59s -> 4240.00s]  I did it
[4240.00s -> 4242.00s]  Okay, we're good
[4245.58s -> 4248.70s]  So what what was the difference between that and the last one I held it
[4251.20s -> 4262.46s]  The next time I do that i'm gonna just hit him once in the toe region. See if I can kill people like that
[4265.90s -> 4267.90s]  I gotta see for that one, but it's all right. Don't worry
[4270.48s -> 4273.52s]  All right, solve the weapon tutorial is now played. All right, here we go
[4274.48s -> 4277.36s]  Let me do let me let me just do them now
[4277.84s -> 4280.08s]  Wait, does that does that am I a checkpoint? I am right?
[4280.80s -> 4287.26s]  How does one change?
[4292.38s -> 4296.06s]  How do you uh, oh, okay. All right. Well, I just took it apparently
[4296.86s -> 4298.93s]  I thought I had to change it
[4298.93s -> 4305.95s]  Apparently something over here
[4310.91s -> 4313.63s]  Have you not played bane? I've never played bayonet. No
[4314.43s -> 4322.93s]  Hello chip. Let's go
[4325.47s -> 4327.73s]  play that next
[4327.73s -> 4330.78s]  maybe
[4330.78s -> 4340.64s]  Is there a stealth?
[4340.64s -> 4342.72s]  Perfect parry here we go one two
[4343.68s -> 4345.44s]  Come on now
[4345.44s -> 4347.62s]  I want a perfect parry you dude. Let's go
[4348.98s -> 4352.22s]  Okay, i'm not even gonna perfect parry it was point just kill him
[4353.26s -> 4367.73s]  Like I may cry isn't the new one coming out soon
[4368.53s -> 4371.68s]  May anymore secrets
[4371.68s -> 4373.18s]  secret
[4373.18s -> 4382.82s]  Got it. Just run like a baby
[4385.84s -> 4395.82s]  Oh speaking of running
[4395.82s -> 4399.42s]  That that easily he's dead. He's just gone. It's that easy
[4401.10s -> 4402.78s]  No screams
[4402.78s -> 4405.82s]  No big dramatic finish. No, he just fell off the bridge
[4412.21s -> 4414.71s]  I got just I just got stuck on the environment
[4415.49s -> 4417.49s]  I got stuck on the lip of the bridge
[4418.13s -> 4423.89s]  How did I get stuck on that?
[4424.85s -> 4444.27s]  Same spot do the tutorial on the bridge
[4444.99s -> 4451.07s]  Oh my god, I guess we keep going
[4457.82s -> 4459.82s]  Oh my god
[4462.59s -> 4466.43s]  Oh, no, we have to do this again. Fuck. This is gonna be the hardest thing I can do in this game
[4466.83s -> 4478.54s]  Is run the bridge
[4478.62s -> 4482.38s]  All right. So seriously what is what is the problem here?
[4486.91s -> 4488.91s]  Stop jumping. It makes you slow
[4489.39s -> 4493.04s]  I didn't jump once
[4493.28s -> 4497.12s]  Half of you guys are saying jump and the other half is saying don't jump
[4498.08s -> 4513.39s]  Which one is it?
[4513.39s -> 4515.55s]  See i'm gonna run that wasn't ready to run last time
[4520.14s -> 4521.73s]  Don't lose
[4521.73s -> 4525.49s]  Is this bridge is my dumb with bridge? Oh lord
[4526.05s -> 4543.76s]  Come on, do it again. Maybe I have to get up closer
[4550.27s -> 4552.27s]  Uh kind of maybe
[4552.35s -> 4555.55s]  All right, the lock on is just fucking my brain here. Let's get up here
[4558.98s -> 4560.98s]  Don't eat them. Don't eat them
[4565.39s -> 4567.39s]  Uh, all right. Well that was
[4567.87s -> 4569.66s]  Okay
[4569.66s -> 4572.22s]  It blinked is it blinking? Is it shooting the?
[4574.93s -> 4576.13s]  All right, what?
[4576.13s -> 4586.54s]  Where'd he go? Okay
[4588.14s -> 4590.14s]  Use that as that's what I was trying to do
[4590.46s -> 4594.82s]  I'm just gonna stay down here. What's the point of going up?
[4595.22s -> 4603.65s]  uh
[4603.65s -> 4605.65s]  Well, there's this on the ground
[4607.82s -> 4609.98s]  Do I have that like equipped now the sub weapon
[4614.29s -> 4620.24s]  Okay
[4620.24s -> 4630.03s]  Interesting
[4630.03s -> 4634.19s]  Well, I guess that's you just have to shoot them with the I get it sounds fun fun
[4634.83s -> 4639.25s]  I don't know. I got another one goes right somewhere
[4647.81s -> 4650.21s]  Is there another one of those rocket launchers?
[4653.84s -> 4654.88s]  There is
[4654.88s -> 4663.46s]  I need to get hit like one more time
[4663.94s -> 4677.52s]  In order to run up them now, you can't fly dick
[4680.85s -> 4683.25s]  Conveniently placed rocket launchers. Yeah, apparently
[4684.91s -> 4686.19s]  All right
[4686.19s -> 4692.32s]  Now i'm gonna do the tutorial
[4692.32s -> 4695.92s]  I'm at the checkpoint head to the indicated waypoint. All right, let's go be honest
[4696.80s -> 4711.63s]  All right. So this is part of the this is new
[4715.90s -> 4717.66s]  All right
[4717.66s -> 4719.82s]  So this is I don't know what what I just pressed
[4728.64s -> 4734.72s]  Your body comes equipped with a technique we call blade mode. Let's begin by assuming the fighting position
[4736.32s -> 4741.14s]  All right fighting position sure now use blade mode to strike all of the targets
[4743.18s -> 4751.81s]  Okay
[4755.25s -> 4759.78s]  Right
[4759.78s -> 4763.78s]  Now remember blade mode exacts a heavy toll on your fuel cells
[4764.32s -> 4770.12s]  Replenish your energy by attacking enemies your blade will absorb the electrolytes automatically
[4770.58s -> 4773.70s]  Try restoring your fuel cells back to maximum now
[4774.26s -> 4779.78s]  Standard cyborgs you can dismember immediately. No problem. Other fools will not fall so easily
[4780.26s -> 4783.54s]  You will first need to attack and damage them to some degree
[4783.94s -> 4785.94s]  Powerade
[4785.94s -> 4788.26s]  So you get it I get it back by damaging people
[4789.86s -> 4791.86s]  Makes perfect sense
[4796.34s -> 4801.14s]  Cool after I need to get the blade
[4802.40s -> 4803.44s]  and now
[4803.44s -> 4808.00s]  The zandatsu technique or stab and grab as some call it
[4808.48s -> 4814.16s]  Activate blade mode with full fuel cells and you will automatically analyze the ideal cutting position
[4814.72s -> 4821.12s]  Executed successfully and you will seize your full self-repair unit and restore some of your quick time event
[4821.60s -> 4825.52s]  Try it for yourself. Take the enemy's repair unit before he falls
[4828.13s -> 4830.50s]  So I did
[4833.06s -> 4835.06s]  That's what the square is for
[4839.73s -> 4843.97s]  Oh, okay. I I understand that I got all right. Okay. All right. All right. All right
[4844.05s -> 4849.41s]  All right, you have to hit the square. You have to slice through the square. That's how you get that
[4851.26s -> 4853.26s]  Next
[4853.90s -> 4859.58s]  Approach a target from the rear or above without being noticed and you can eliminate them with a single strike
[4859.58s -> 4862.06s]  Did you not know already? Well, we've only seen it like three times
[4864.72s -> 4867.76s]  I've only seen that square like three times
[4868.91s -> 4882.03s]  Come on
[4882.03s -> 4888.59s]  About your enhanced ar enhanced ar add several layers of information to your augmented reality vision
[4889.07s -> 4893.47s]  Use it for additional intel on your enemies you missed it new aspects of your surroundings
[4893.95s -> 4898.27s]  Just remember enhanced ar is automatically disabled as soon as you attack
[4901.22s -> 4906.53s]  Yeah
[4906.53s -> 4912.69s]  Head to the waypoint you can see me through walls. All right, he's not even doing this. All I needed to know is the square thing
[4913.65s -> 4921.12s]  Because now that makes a whole lot of sense. You have to cut it right
[4930.29s -> 4932.29s]  He just leaves I just
[4945.31s -> 4948.35s]  All right, this is come across several different weapons in your missions
[4948.91s -> 4950.91s]  Best we went over their basic use
[4951.95s -> 4955.71s]  Pick up the rocket launcher in front of you. No, I did just I did just figure this out though
[4956.75s -> 4962.03s]  You can equip any weapons you acquire by selecting them in the sub weapon screen
[4963.25s -> 4966.45s]  Of course sub weapons have a limited number of uses, you know
[4967.57s -> 4972.45s]  In this tutorial it has unlimited ammunition, but do not expect this out on the field
[4973.65s -> 4977.65s]  You will want to save them for just the right time. I suspect you can hip fire
[4977.81s -> 4982.53s]  Try all the sub weapons you come across you find that each has its own unique properties
[4983.81s -> 4986.61s]  Now use these weapons to reach the goal point
[4991.09s -> 4993.09s]  Yeah, change sub weapon. There it is
[5000.88s -> 5002.64s]  I just accidentally
[5002.64s -> 5005.58s]  my fucking finger
[5005.66s -> 5007.66s]  Console aim by the way
[5007.66s -> 5028.94s]  All right. That was fun
[5028.94s -> 5034.77s]  Do a rocket jump. You can't do rocket jumps. What are you?
[5035.49s -> 5042.27s]  You can't do that
[5042.27s -> 5044.37s]  Right in the head
[5044.37s -> 5045.49s]  Oh
[5045.49s -> 5056.11s]  Is there a way I can quick switch weapons like that or do I have to go to the menu every time?
[5061.33s -> 5066.38s]  All right, almost done
[5066.38s -> 5070.62s]  Just use the d-pad. I mean that's what i'm doing. I okay right on the d-pad opens this menu
[5071.42s -> 5074.38s]  Left on the d-pad opens the menu down on the d-pad up on the d-pad
[5075.90s -> 5078.06s]  Does that and have to menu? Okay?
[5088.66s -> 5094.02s]  I mean, it's not it's not my fault that this guy's on like a little cube. Okay, he's on a cube
[5095.22s -> 5100.37s]  How am I supposed to get that guy when you have a he's on a cube
[5118.56s -> 5120.00s]  Okay
[5120.00s -> 5122.00s]  I'm serious. What?
[5122.08s -> 5128.08s]  I guarantee you didn't do that. I guarantee you did this tutorial. He did the same fucking thing. I guarantee it
[5128.40s -> 5130.88s]  Okay, that's a 100 guaranteed
[5131.92s -> 5134.40s]  I won a hundred percent guarantee that
[5138.70s -> 5144.22s]  Your new enhancements are quite something if I do say so myself now I get the square thing. I'm ready to go
[5144.54s -> 5160.10s]  Oh sub weapons suck anyways in this game. All right. Well, that's good to know jokes on you. I didn't do the tutorial
[5161.30s -> 5167.68s]  All right, i'm ready customized
[5176.59s -> 5180.75s]  That poor guy I that's not what I wanted that happened god damn it
[5188.75s -> 5190.51s]  Cut it cut the thing
[5190.51s -> 5191.55s]  Got it
[5191.55s -> 5205.76s]  No, get it. Got it
[5205.76s -> 5219.58s]  What the fuck are you?
[5219.58s -> 5221.58s]  oops
[5222.99s -> 5224.99s]  Holy shit squards
[5225.07s -> 5227.07s]  10 community subs from squards
[5228.77s -> 5230.69s]  Holy shit. Thank you
[5230.69s -> 5237.54s]  That's a lot
[5237.54s -> 5239.30s]  10 community subs
[5239.30s -> 5243.22s]  I say I get it. I get I understand it now. It takes sometimes it takes a minute to figure out what you're doing
[5246.02s -> 5249.30s]  Like I don't have like an implant in my brain where I download a game
[5250.10s -> 5252.10s]  And know exactly how to do everything
[5253.14s -> 5256.98s]  It takes a tutorial. Look, it's giving me a little bit of a break
[5257.14s -> 5263.39s]  In your left hand and a cyborg with access and uh borrow it
[5263.47s -> 5267.71s]  Do you see any cyborgs around here doc? Why not double back check the vehicle route again?
[5268.11s -> 5272.75s]  You know back breaking down. No, i'm fine. Who knows maybe you can hitch a ride
[5273.23s -> 5278.91s]  Most likely platoon commanders carry correct id data for the gate use enhanced mode to figure out who to hit
[5279.55s -> 5281.23s]  All right, we're gonna find
[5281.23s -> 5283.23s]  We're gonna find somebody that has the data
[5284.35s -> 5286.35s]  This guy does apparently
[5286.35s -> 5292.37s]  Well, there's a bunch of people in there
[5294.13s -> 5299.44s]  How do you guys not know i'm here
[5300.43s -> 5303.63s]  No, no, no, no, no, I didn't get it. I missed it
[5304.51s -> 5312.45s]  No, I don't have enough. Okay, whatever
[5316.51s -> 5318.51s]  That like little chunk of his body. Fuck
[5319.47s -> 5338.88s]  Wait, somebody has the dna. Okay, I cut all around it. All right. Where are you?
[5339.97s -> 5344.05s]  Right you you missed them all. What? Well, you just have to fight
[5346.37s -> 5352.38s]  Hold on. Wait, wait what you what do you mean? I missed them all
[5355.60s -> 5358.72s]  What was I supposed what was I what was I what did I do wrong?
[5359.28s -> 5362.48s]  Oh their hands. Oh, I needed to bring their hand back
[5364.99s -> 5366.99s]  I was supposed to cut that guy's arm off
[5367.39s -> 5369.39s]  And bring it back here
[5370.03s -> 5372.35s]  Wow, man, you missed them all holy shit
[5373.71s -> 5376.91s]  Really am I not close enough?
[5379.73s -> 5383.01s]  Really you missed them all that's never happened before
[5383.97s -> 5386.59s]  I'm actually pretty surprised. That's even possible
[5387.47s -> 5414.86s]  This early in the game
[5422.72s -> 5442.27s]  I'm just gonna have to shoot you with the rocket launcher. I guess wait what? Oh, okay. I just I just cut that
[5444.59s -> 5458.10s]  I gotta be quick with that
[5458.66s -> 5474.96s]  You're dead good. I need to get a left arm
[5484.30s -> 5487.74s]  If you cut all of someone's limbs off, they still try to come after you really
[5488.70s -> 5494.06s]  That's kind of crazy
[5494.62s -> 5499.23s]  All right, I got the heels
[5499.31s -> 5521.36s]  What else we got 3d photo frame, how does that do come on get up there lore. Ooh
[5522.75s -> 5524.75s]  Lore everybody loves lore. Don't they?
[5565.54s -> 5569.46s]  Snipe him snipe him take the shot take the shot you have it right there snipe him
[5571.88s -> 5583.58s]  Unbelievable. I'm a proponent of a few just don't even wear the jacket
[5584.48s -> 5586.64s]  You know, why do you have just on your back like that?
[5597.01s -> 5599.44s]  What's happening?
[5600.08s -> 5606.58s]  Uh text from text from dad I just dodged a new voicemail from dad
[5607.62s -> 5625.71s]  All right. I'm heading for the refinery. Good job parrying those cooties
[5628.19s -> 5630.19s]  All right, hold on got the fact
[5630.67s -> 5637.60s]  What do I got? I got some parts I can put into my body
[5643.04s -> 5652.35s]  Body new new new new. All right custom body custom body original body gray fox
[5653.84s -> 5655.84s]  white armor inferno armor
[5656.86s -> 5659.60s]  Unpurchased all right. I have 35 000 bp
[5660.48s -> 5663.92s]  So why would I buy one of these skins that I do anything?
[5667.71s -> 5669.71s]  gray fox gray fox gray fox
[5670.78s -> 5677.26s]  Functionally equivalent to recent side though. It was terminated as an exoskeleton in these days where they happen in modern cybernetic technology
[5677.34s -> 5679.66s]  It could have been taken. So why would I do this? It's just cosmetic
[5681.26s -> 5683.98s]  Don't I want to make sure I save my money to buy like new weapons?
[5686.30s -> 5689.34s]  I only got one. Wow. Okay. Well, that's two hundred thousand
[5690.30s -> 5697.02s]  Like attack power energy use special effect
[5699.31s -> 5700.27s]  life
[5700.27s -> 5708.46s]  Uh, I got an enhancement here enhance upgrade an updated version of raiden's cyborg body firmware that immediately reshapes his artificial muscular
[5708.86s -> 5711.26s]  Whenever he's hit reducing the amount of damage taken
[5712.29s -> 5714.13s]  Wow, I mean I want that
[5714.13s -> 5719.12s]  Yeah, like endurance plus one
[5719.84s -> 5725.58s]  This is 8 000 fuel cell an updated version of raiden's cyborg body firmware
[5726.14s -> 5730.62s]  Optimizes power usage represented in the air display as an extended field cell. Uh, yeah
[5733.12s -> 5735.57s]  skills
[5735.57s -> 5738.72s]  aerial parry
[5738.72s -> 5743.84s]  That improves balance when airborne enabling to parry enemy attacks in midair. Uh, okay. Thank you
[5746.46s -> 5754.38s]  Faster more detailed feedback to be delivered to his brain synapses this detailed neural feedback allows raiden to freely sidestep enemy attacks in any direction
[5755.02s -> 5757.02s]  and counter their aggression
[5757.34s -> 5758.46s]  Yeah
[5758.46s -> 5761.70s]  Sounds great
[5761.70s -> 5767.06s]  Improves reaction speed in his quadriceps enabling a special upward thrust with his weapon held in his foot
[5768.32s -> 5769.84s]  That's a dodge roll
[5769.84s -> 5773.26s]  Thank god
[5773.26s -> 5774.78s]  sweep kick
[5774.78s -> 5776.78s]  Thunder strike, okay
[5777.62s -> 5782.96s]  What else do I got?
[5782.96s -> 5784.16s]  That's it, right?
[5784.16s -> 5786.18s]  I got some upgrades
[5786.18s -> 5795.74s]  Wait, you're gonna you're gonna wait. Hold on. I can you can do your current weapon?
[5797.50s -> 5799.50s]  I don't have to just buy another
[5799.50s -> 5806.48s]  Let me see
[5806.48s -> 5808.02s]  main weapon
[5808.02s -> 5810.02s]  This is okay zero equipment
[5812.84s -> 5814.86s]  Enhancements
[5814.86s -> 5817.26s]  Strength plus one of I mean I can still I can afford it
[5819.73s -> 5822.29s]  Moves become enabling to deal greater damage to enemies
[5823.76s -> 5826.40s]  Absorbs more electrolytes from it makes the fuel
[5827.60s -> 5829.60s]  Bar go up higher
[5830.70s -> 5832.70s]  Uh, i'm gonna say
[5833.34s -> 5837.66s]  Let's just go with
[5837.66s -> 5839.66s]  I want to yeah electrolytes
[5851.15s -> 5852.67s]  big bits
[5852.67s -> 5854.67s]  Lucky bone just gave 30 dollars
[5857.58s -> 5859.58s]  Uh lucky bone. Thank you for the 30 bucks
[5860.80s -> 5864.24s]  Funny story here. I accidentally purchased a shit ton of bits
[5864.96s -> 5869.68s]  Completely by accident. You're my favorite human being. So here you go. Not much. What do you mean? Not much
[5872.48s -> 5876.03s]  not much
[5876.03s -> 5878.03s]  30 that's a fucking 30 dollars
[5878.83s -> 5884.27s]  All right, so that's the dodge. It's a and x at the same time in a direction
[5884.27s -> 5888.59s]  Can I do it backwards? I can't can I do it forwards? No, so you can do side to side
[5893.28s -> 5896.03s]  All right, cool
[5896.03s -> 5898.03s]  That's 30 bucks. That's not
[5898.96s -> 5900.96s]  Oh, that's not much. Yes, it is

[5931.25s -> 5933.25s]  Thanks for the bits, yeah, thank you
[5938.00s -> 5940.00s]  Greedy streamer demands more what
[5941.15s -> 5944.59s]  I said don't say the 30 dollars is not much because it's a lot

[6196.11s -> 6198.11s]  Take it off. No, you know what I was trying to say
[6212.37s -> 6214.37s]  At least they're low enough where I don't have to shoot them with rockets
[6224.83s -> 6227.31s]  Why are they flying so low? Yeah, they could be so much higher up
[6228.03s -> 6236.98s]  All right, you're out

[6275.14s -> 6277.22s]  No, it was only built two years ago
[6277.70s -> 6280.42s]  There should be a narrow path around there that leads to the plant
[6280.98s -> 6284.58s]  It is protected by a fence, but probably you can cut your way through
[6285.14s -> 6286.58s]  probably
[6286.58s -> 6288.98s]  Don't get cocky most likely it is
[6289.38s -> 6291.54s]  I don't know why I was about to just scream

[6433.82s -> 6435.82s]  Should I really get stuck inside of this?
[6436.46s -> 6441.60s]  I didn't get seen watch this ready one two three
[6448.00s -> 6452.13s]  Didn't even see me no alert wait secrets
[6455.98s -> 6462.06s]  Why do they put that shit in games anymore? You know what I mean?
[6471.50s -> 6495.02s]  They do that. I tried to block it. Okay, the thing is that thing is shooting me. You gotta go
[6503.54s -> 6506.98s]  What am I even look who's on me this one of these little frogs is on me

[6577.17s -> 6578.69s]  Oh well
[6578.69s -> 6587.62s]  Is there a way I've reliably killed these things besides like jumping and having to splash blindly
[6596.22s -> 6601.60s]  I'm like pausing. I don't know just have run past them
[6605.22s -> 6609.55s]  Why would I do that?

[7983.60s -> 7987.64s]  this is the second but I am paying attention highlighting I know what to
[7987.64s -> 7996.17s]  say yeah I say let's throw my bow we're playing my exoskeleton resembles
[7997.05s -> 8014.53s]  he's our friend now two levels that's nice dirty to play his dog I told you
[8014.53s -> 8018.41s]  to be nice to the animals that's just the cat that's the cat that's its
[8018.41s -> 8038.89s]  brain has been implanted into a cybernetic being pop champ I cannot
[8038.89s -> 8043.33s]  wait for the inevitable when the dog goes there's gonna be some sarcastic
[8043.33s -> 8049.72s]  comment where he goes whoop whoop it's gonna happen
[8057.93s -> 8063.64s]  because the whole time it's like oh you're a dog but he's not a dog and
[8063.64s -> 8067.12s]  then he's gonna get really upset about it over the course of time I'm
[8067.12s -> 8070.44s]  in this somebody makes a joke about hey your dog coming on sarcastically
[8070.44s -> 8074.36s]  gonna go ahead looking well I guess affiliated research center somewhere in
[8074.36s -> 8078.36s]  that area according to the Intel from our client the labs been dumping
[8078.36s -> 8083.04s]  illegal waste into those sewers FYI they're also involved with the
[8083.04s -> 8088.00s]  cartels in human trafficking allegedly anyway don't give me those ha ha it's
[8088.00s -> 8091.96s]  right now better now it's not me making a joke need you to infiltrate
[8091.96s -> 8096.68s]  the last difference everything you mean joke reference and prediction first we
[8096.68s -> 8100.52s]  still don't know the exact location so I'm looking for anywhere the lab
[8100.52s -> 8104.48s]  might hook up with the sewers yep if they're actually dumping waste
[8104.48s -> 8109.40s]  they've got a link up somehow find that connection sneak into the lab and see if
[8109.40s -> 8113.00s]  you can find evidence implicating them on anything no problem
[8113.00s -> 8119.64s]  stealths my specialty reference equals joke well how do we have any idea
[8119.64s -> 8124.12s]  what kind of research they're doing there not really that's not true
[8124.12s -> 8127.72s]  maybe something related to all the people they're trafficking like
[8127.72s -> 8133.36s]  experimentation it's possible first things first though find a way into
[8133.36s -> 8143.44s]  that lab all right it's all be TV black crocodile so you know watch out black
[8143.44s -> 8149.76s]  crocodiles could they be talking about you geez maybe just an urban legend but
[8149.76s -> 8154.08s]  still be careful you said it was your New Year's resolution you now
[8154.08s -> 8160.24s]  provide that that was the joke there's the joke sir commence operation you
[8160.28s -> 8180.14s]  know whoa that's just kind of what we just that was too fast what okay that
[8180.14s -> 8184.44s]  was joke is the you know you know New Year's resolution and it's always you
[8184.44s -> 8187.96s]  never do it you say you're gonna do it you don't so I'm not gonna do it
[8187.96s -> 8194.01s]  that would get on daytime TV if it's like twitch was on daytime TV that
[8194.01s -> 8198.13s]  would be daytime TV twitch.TV NBC joke
[8203.01s -> 8220.11s]  well wait for a parry moment right there I'm gonna get some perfect parry
[8220.11s -> 8236.59s]  ah fuck can you not parry those you just dodge I guess it's the dog
[8236.59s -> 8248.65s]  whoa I thought he was dead apparently not no what's that what is that he's
[8248.65s -> 8265.93s]  just like shit on an ice cube I don't oh no no wait that's an item
[8265.93s -> 8271.41s]  use it to conceal yourself if necessary
[8272.61s -> 8278.84s]  nobody knows the lyrics to those everyone only knows that one part all
[8278.84s -> 8288.33s]  right so I need everything but the place I need everything but the
[8288.33s -> 8291.61s]  place everywhere but the one spot I needed to do that I don't know how I
[8291.61s -> 8302.63s]  didn't relax in fact I'm gonna get back up top easy here come on you
[8302.63s -> 8310.47s]  can't get up there all right what and why I don't I don't explain like I'm
[8310.47s -> 8322.78s]  getting the glitched into the boxes just get up there that was so much
[8322.78s -> 8354.10s]  more difficult than it and he's gone whatever what is he gonna do it didn't
[8354.10s -> 8368.59s]  get the arm he does double thump
[8368.83s -> 8385.15s]  okay backwards swing man the guy has no arms
[8385.15s -> 8413.80s]  should I heal I'm not sure if I should even feel here there is a boy in these
[8413.80s -> 8422.72s]  sewers recoveries down right don't you feel automatically um I don't do
[8422.72s -> 8441.00s]  you you do I don't maybe I'm just too afraid to die jamming grenade right
[8441.04s -> 8465.54s]  that is throw this I think I'm just gonna throw this what a waste that's for
[8465.54s -> 8471.96s]  me to determine I think I need secondary items to win a guy with no arms just
[8471.96s -> 8490.30s]  almost killed me I actually need items for this game wait nice
[8490.30s -> 8493.50s]  yeah and I got replaced and plus somebody told me that the items don't
[8493.50s -> 8500.61s]  matter in this game guys somebody said secondary items bad also this is
[8500.61s -> 8512.44s]  the new weapon right one guy said that and they might be right you guys
[8512.44s -> 8517.20s]  seriously need to relax don't do it when you come and go to it
[8517.20s -> 8523.59s]  relax don't do it when you come around what even are the lyrics that's
[8523.59s -> 8558.16s]  on apparently okay oh you're doing something that I don't know what you're
[8558.16s -> 8594.48s]  doing okay the purple bad purple not good purple bad purple bad bad well
[8594.52s -> 8612.50s]  that was a lot slower than I thought it was tell me I didn't get it what am I
[8612.50s -> 8681.46s]  not getting here I'm still alive okay I just kind of feel bad he's just
[8681.50s -> 8715.69s]  shooting his machine gun at me I'll get you I'll get you a dead-on
[8716.69s -> 8723.91s]  it's a thousand briefs
[8730.91s -> 8736.59s]  yeah I'm from America he's the lowest rank that's not true we saw a see it
[8736.59s -> 8748.59s]  already George yeah so what are you doing here
[8752.71s -> 8758.35s]  why that's subtitle for bad guys why the to counter research lab you know
[8758.35s -> 8766.81s]  about it you know me now go back hey you're not one of them Scott now no I
[8766.81s -> 8772.41s]  guess you're all right that well that was clear what that was you know who
[8772.41s -> 8779.28s]  day is sort of what happened to you we've been live on the street they can
[8779.48s -> 8784.92s]  above now then this good need dressed like the mafia say hey why you want a
[8784.92s -> 8791.28s]  job what the worst gonna happen now don't put me on a raspbook they pack
[8791.28s -> 8794.36s]  us all a big of a dirty container next thing we know we're here at that
[8794.36s -> 8801.53s]  chum be left our kids like you yeah a lot of wine but then we've been
[8801.53s -> 8811.06s]  over here what Dems can't want to do snuff us out and got all day all game so
[8811.06s -> 8820.47s]  you're a shame me not a bad-ass robot ninja man same as you maybe the
[8820.47s -> 8824.47s]  strongest cyborg ever warlock all them phantoms in black clothes that I
[8824.47s -> 8829.71s]  passed me starting to sound like a bad guy yourself just playing now we
[8829.71s -> 8838.82s]  done plenty bad thing oh me not kill no man now never good we tried to warn
[8838.82s -> 8842.90s]  another boy I say I would ease brain would get cut out run your ass out of
[8842.90s -> 8847.14s]  there what damn boy with me no understand they like Spanish or
[8847.14s -> 8851.74s]  something so me the only one for escape then that machine come after me
[8851.74s -> 8858.40s]  and and I know the rest George I need every detail about how you
[8858.44s -> 8867.84s]  escaped George please tell me so the kid got into the sewers through a
[8867.84s -> 8872.40s]  drainage channel yeah he says the channel is super tight but there's some
[8872.40s -> 8876.44s]  kind of shutter next to it yeah George that must be where they dumped the
[8876.44s -> 8882.32s]  waste George it sounds like a desperado exec was on site yesterday if a
[8882.32s -> 8886.00s]  sentry cyborg was on hand for the meeting you should be able to review
[8886.00s -> 8889.66s]  their video log provided you can find the server access looks like he
[8889.66s -> 8894.00s]  actually belongs in a different game as well as a little peek at the level of
[8894.00s -> 8898.16s]  that technology that's a resident evil sign so what about the kid I made sure
[8898.16s -> 8902.32s]  the area was secure and told him to sit tight can you pick him up sure
[8902.32s -> 8906.04s]  I'll send a couple agents for it you just focus on getting into that
[8906.04s -> 8911.40s]  land if what he said is true about the organs we need to hurry agreed
[8911.40s -> 8916.40s]  right now this is the right door
[8919.40s -> 8923.48s]  it is possible they are conducting test operations while the lab is closed
[8923.48s -> 8927.36s]  they're not gonna make it easy to get into that land there's some way you
[8927.36s -> 8933.24s]  could sneak past what's that the first time I've touched one of these
[8933.24s -> 8945.96s]  computer data devices all right I got it oh man oh man oh man yeah yes
[8945.96s -> 8950.55s]  it's gonna be so fun how's that gonna help I can't wait
[8950.55s -> 8966.68s]  medical supplies where is it that could work actually yeah well you knew it was
[8966.68s -> 8972.39s]  coming it's up no okay I thought I just get lost I have to see this is
[8972.39s -> 9015.83s]  sneak mission with boss he's the only one that has an issue with this oh he
[9015.87s -> 9032.38s]  got up here no go no wait oh god they're all up here I have to turn this on now
[9032.38s -> 9067.26s]  go just get this is a bad place to fight all of you guys no god he's
[9067.26s -> 9097.08s]  running out of circles damn it I didn't see him on screen fuck I thought
[9097.08s -> 9127.61s]  I got with me he broke my neck how are you still alive no more legs for
[9127.61s -> 9145.50s]  you get out of my way I got the arm good damn it I tried to block it
[9145.54s -> 9174.67s]  both of you both of you both of you both of you come on break
[9185.47s -> 9197.78s]  yeah I'll do it sure this gets fun fun game how are you still not getting it I
[9197.78s -> 9201.62s]  am I know I have to hit the square but I had like a second to do it I didn't
[9201.66s -> 9204.03s]  get it
[9219.30s -> 9227.10s]  I'm trying all right hold on a second I'm trying to to parry that but I'm
[9227.10s -> 9238.61s]  just dashing forward into the fire so there you can't block that I can't
[9238.61s -> 9241.53s]  like do anything about that is that deal with it okay
[9241.53s -> 9247.93s]  like left or right well I gotta keep going more than that
[9247.97s -> 9272.42s]  take his brain out yeah your brains gone thanks for the brain
[9272.42s -> 9284.76s]  oh shit there's another one go the other way
[9284.76s -> 9304.84s]  whoa what the hell are you doing here one more another one
[9309.22s -> 9343.40s]  whoa there's two where where am I too many oh god fuck too many
[9343.84s -> 9380.42s]  feel the burn I was doing my cutscene I always miss it the first time every
[9380.42s -> 9399.87s]  done for that plus thousand full find a way into the research facility I will
[9399.87s -> 9404.98s]  I already cleared the whole fucking area wait I'm going the wrong way aren't I
[9404.98s -> 9418.66s]  am I going the wrong way right now lost for health packs equals a well when
[9418.66s -> 9423.46s]  they give me two of those guys the fire everywhere there's a box I could open
[9423.46s -> 9434.77s]  down here where is it did I already get it another something else maybe I'm
[9434.77s -> 9447.47s]  maybe I'm just there we go it's up there there to get it I didn't get it
[9447.47s -> 9487.88s]  okay really why can I not open this okay data storage I got it you got to
[9487.88s -> 9512.28s]  use seco mode another box that he's finite this is one out of five who
[9512.28s -> 9521.72s]  knows right I have determined the approximate location of the lab based
[9521.72s -> 9528.72s]  on your soliton radar that's a good that's a good point that's good but
[9528.72s -> 9544.65s]  mod that guy I'm just kidding all right so combo lists it's like a pole
[9544.65s -> 9550.71s]  arm okay he's in there so let's see there's just why why why why why why
[9550.71s -> 9560.20s]  why why why why why X why X why why X a lot of why starts yeah most of them are
[9560.20s -> 9568.32s]  why starts why why X why oh my lord okay why why why X why let's test
[9568.32s -> 9587.06s]  that out why why why okay let's test it on this guy that was like three
[9587.06s -> 9612.52s]  perfect areas again I thought was lined up correctly it was we got any
[9612.52s -> 9618.08s]  treasures not that I can confirm but hold on a minute
[9618.08s -> 9645.42s]  back I can't fit in here perfect shit I thought it was me I'm always afraid
[9645.42s -> 9662.83s]  to do a full like every dude one or two swings even up what else is in
[9662.87s -> 9673.14s]  here what do you want for me there's another guy in here hold on let me
[9673.14s -> 9675.66s]  sneak attack this guy I can stealth backstab kill this guy in one hit right
[9675.66s -> 9695.27s]  what's this right oh I could have done it something I actually could have done
[9695.27s -> 9699.25s]  that damn I really didn't think you could actually do something like that
[9699.25s -> 9714.40s]  I was just making a joke but you can't you actually can do that you're
[9714.40s -> 9728.81s]  gonna breathe fire too this is a smooth experience what's this game have
[9728.81s -> 9754.97s]  on medic product 61 that's unfair camera yeah the enemies are spawning
[9755.29s -> 9768.21s]  this farming experience point so where am I supposed to go I need to find a
[9768.21s -> 9779.46s]  way to get out of here and is this way can I go over I mean this is gonna
[9779.46s -> 9789.31s]  take me back around isn't it I was already in here right I have
[9789.31s -> 9792.71s]  discovered the entrance to the lab so you know coordinates to your
[9792.71s -> 9795.63s]  soliton radar took you long enough thanks a lot
[9795.63s -> 9808.47s]  playing Metal Gear Survive oh no I don't think so I don't think so
[9811.51s -> 9837.16s]  I took too long don't give me that it was scripted one two my forklift people
[9837.16s -> 9840.84s]  is there like a forklift item that you can I don't know what the fuck I'm
[9840.84s -> 9861.60s]  talking about so let's just play is this some kind of forklift thing when
[9861.60s -> 9869.21s]  am I gonna play metal gear rising probably next week this would appear to
[9869.21s -> 9872.97s]  be the huge in maintenance area you should find a terminal there
[9872.97s -> 9876.69s]  something they used to upload mission parameters to say you cheese and
[9876.69s -> 9882.21s]  something I can use to access the labs main server perhaps but first you need
[9882.21s -> 9886.29s]  no I thought there were two games that were in this series I thought it was
[9886.29s -> 9890.29s]  metal gear rising and then I thought there was metal gear rising revenge
[9890.29s -> 9893.77s]  you'll need one to interface with the terminal most any you G should
[9893.77s -> 9899.41s]  suffice tripod or the like I'll see what I can come up with how do I use
[9899.41s -> 9904.17s]  it simply connect to it you should be able to use your communications outlet
[9904.17s -> 9908.09s]  to control the proxy Eugene I missed something over here let's give it a shot
[9908.09s -> 9914.15s]  well there was like a funny joke that I missed something happened out of that
[9914.15s -> 9917.96s]  window
[9931.87s -> 9935.25s]  well that's the only chance that I have to be able to speak because my
[9935.25s -> 9960.18s]  brain has to turn off when I fight enemies short attention span well nobody
[9960.18s -> 9980.45s]  saw that okay well and you guys thought I who had tunnel vision how do I
[9980.45s -> 9983.13s]  do a stealth takedown
[9985.01s -> 10000.85s]  no how do you do stealth take down like this is up here where do you
[10000.85s -> 10004.41s]  go there's something that got bounced it's because he bounced got
[10005.25s -> 10032.05s]  walk up behind a present be whoa no no you're not gonna do that shit somebody
[10032.05s -> 10065.10s]  charge at me somebody do something fine I'll start what can I interrupt that
[10065.10s -> 10092.64s]  or something do I just have to run away still too far away really how is
[10092.64s -> 10108.95s]  that even possible again I don't know how it's possible for me to miss
[10108.95s -> 10114.11s]  that there's only one sliver that's even possible to hit there use the
[10114.11s -> 10120.67s]  other stick to aim better right stick or something like a just manually do it
[10120.67s -> 10127.60s]  you have plenty of time and maybe that's not just freaking out I think I
[10127.60s -> 10148.44s]  have like a fire extinguisher all right I did it that filled up the
[10148.44s -> 10167.47s]  whole room can I not open this door this looks like a door I can slash
[10167.47s -> 10184.84s]  through apparently go down here do I eat on a day that I stream like an hour
[10184.84s -> 10222.03s]  before and then that's it all right well we're starting here I want to
[10222.03s -> 10228.63s]  try to get a bowl I did panic there for a second
[10233.39s -> 10242.57s]  I do have lots of time really need stuff
[10242.57s -> 10257.62s]  okay solid metal gears rises one of them is a sword game and the other one
[10257.62s -> 10268.47s]  is a when you for now stealth stealth there it is but that room those were
[10268.47s -> 10273.67s]  cyborg brain casings duh we saw George said they were harvesting
[10273.67s -> 10277.47s]  organs from kids yes this must be why they are trafficking
[10277.47s -> 10281.51s]  children perhaps other organs are being sold elsewhere but they are definitely
[10281.51s -> 10287.71s]  taking their brains Jesus are they making these kids into cyborgs wait the
[10287.71s -> 10292.19s]  cyborgs you've been fighting did they seem like they might be kids you said
[10292.19s -> 10295.51s]  earlier the child soldiers have a telltale approach to combat I just want
[10295.51s -> 10299.75s]  to open this up but I didn't see it here those weren't kids bad time so
[10299.75s -> 10304.07s]  what desperado is just doing the surgeries there we've got to do
[10304.07s -> 10307.79s]  something about all those brains and the other kids George was talking about
[10307.79s -> 10312.43s]  he changes his voice a few hours ago he does the Christian Bale Batman
[10312.43s -> 10316.75s]  thing true there could still be a bunch of kids they haven't touched yet
[10316.75s -> 10337.27s]  I better move sometimes he just goes like this sometimes okay all right I
[10337.27s -> 10338.97s]  don't know why you do that's the equivalent of picking up like a
[10338.97s -> 10341.43s]  pretzel you found on the ground you don't just put that into your
[10342.03s -> 10363.59s]  damn it any funny business and they might just open fine try latching onto
[10363.59s -> 10367.39s]  cyborgs heads from behind then an electric shock should lock them
[10367.39s -> 10374.00s]  unconscious do we really have to have an avoid everybody spider-man Mary Jane
[10374.00s -> 10384.58s]  mission I want that give that to me what am I looking for a terminal or
[10384.58s -> 10409.94s]  something my friend what do we do sorry I'm sorry all right so I gotta go that
[10409.94s -> 10433.27s]  way all right got a guide there I'm thinking all right another one of
[10433.27s -> 10450.45s]  those assholes I need to get rid of that guy good moment whoa how do I
[10450.45s -> 10465.28s]  stop him how do I like attach on his head
[10470.96s -> 10478.12s]  I see the joke that you can never get a USB the first time you try to put a
[10478.12s -> 10492.46s]  USB in USB joke it's perfect explaining the joke well just in case somebody
[10492.46s -> 10495.38s]  didn't ever put a USB in a computer before don't they have like new like
[10495.38s -> 10500.80s]  the lightning cable you might not even know what it is USB in five years is
[10500.80s -> 10521.24s]  gonna be like saying DVD half you guys don't even know what a DVD is DVD was
[10521.24s -> 10529.24s]  like 25 years ago some of you guys might not even know that is
[10545.83s -> 10552.59s]  D-I-V-I-D-I somebody wrote what is a DVD
[10586.30s -> 10589.50s]  accounting will be in touch
[10603.07s -> 10608.71s]  Dr. Eggman's outfit combine all the characters in this game you'll have
[10608.71s -> 10616.22s]  dr. Eggman you see that kev in money's killer this
[10616.42s -> 10623.30s]  chief of operations goes by sundowner the Californian wildfire the kids think

[13049.30s -> 13055.27s]  know it's just it's very difficult for me to do that I feel like it's
[13055.27s -> 13057.55s]  harder for me to do that than just trying to aim with left stick in the
[13058.11s -> 13074.97s]  triangle from the or lion X what would you like me to do jump okay that's the
[13074.97s -> 13090.84s]  thing that's gonna stop me there are stairs why use stairs when you can
[13090.84s -> 13097.91s]  slice through everything it's more fun that way
[13097.91s -> 13130.74s]  hammer okay I can't carry that one these guys gotta go no no that's not
[13130.74s -> 13155.54s]  what I wanted to do that's some kind of achievement for some reason two hammer
[13155.54s -> 13161.90s]  guys are gonna be fun what was that magnet passing bullshit he just like
[13161.90s -> 13178.80s]  attached to my body why are you dark souls lock on that's bullshit the

[13231.95s -> 13262.37s]  there's a ladder next to me I can't use it this is why not that miss
[13266.40s -> 13287.98s]  where are you going good dog point blank am I gonna beat the whole game
[13287.98s -> 13292.26s]  today that depends huh I wonder how much I'll try I'll try to get through
[13292.26s -> 13316.10s]  the whole thing an indicator was what the indicator was sitting oh my god
[13316.10s -> 13321.11s]  that was an indicator issue and I thought there was a ledge just I thought
[13321.11s -> 13330.56s]  that was another place to drop down a current period whatever I'm not gonna
[13330.56s -> 13371.90s]  complain well that's not what happened I'm just as confused as all of you are
[13371.90s -> 13386.39s]  okay this time go to edge but no don't go to edge I have to just go
[13386.39s -> 13392.89s]  over there I for some reason just saw the blip and I was like oh there's
[13392.89s -> 13435.11s]  probably a door down there or second I thought I did it again okay come on no
[13435.11s -> 13438.91s]  it's right trigger to run and I'm really good can I get both these guys
[13438.91s -> 13451.03s]  from far away they kill them every time am I supposed to be rescuing these
[13451.03s -> 13513.84s]  guys don't follow him down there hold don't oh my god
[13513.84s -> 13518.08s]  you cannot proceed any further via the rooftops there is a freight railroad
[13518.08s -> 13522.96s]  underground the elevator ahead will take you to it do it for the joke not
[13523.08s -> 13538.80s]  the whole thing if I do that again I swear to God I keep pressing left
[13538.80s -> 13561.09s]  trigger to run this must be the railroad it would appear so likely part
[13561.09s -> 13564.33s]  of Denver's old system couldn't just take the elevator like a normal
[13564.33s -> 13568.93s]  person in the early years of freight trains this particular line appears
[13568.93s -> 13573.53s]  to have been abandoned some time ago it was originally constructed to transport
[13573.53s -> 13578.21s]  supplies to an underground factory but now it seems even the electrical
[13578.21s -> 13583.05s]  system is no longer functioning yeah it's pitch black in here as a
[13583.05s -> 13595.02s]  cyborg I trust this is not a serious concern I hate this I don't hate this
[13595.02s -> 13621.34s]  anymore no I've never might I do hate oh get out and his enemies in here it's
[13621.34s -> 13632.54s]  wonderful night vision goggles can I just skip
[13632.54s -> 13647.34s]  fighting these guys oh okay so I should do this then all right it's
[13647.34s -> 13653.50s]  only it's one or the other I can't be in the box hold on wait that why they
[13653.50s -> 13664.89s]  can see me why can hold on a minute pitch black we can they have the same
[13664.89s -> 13676.26s]  items that I don't expose yourself apparently they also happen I think I
[13676.26s -> 13697.44s]  thought I had to be a little closer to that we just glued to my body with
[13697.44s -> 13732.88s]  that arm God I need to get in a better spot somewhere over here slide
[13733.44s -> 13772.42s]  I've dodged Lord please can I please not do this again let me just move on from
[13772.42s -> 13811.90s]  this please activate the train I'm you know I'm getting stuck in animations
[13811.90s -> 13814.82s]  that's one of the problems like I'm gonna swing swing and then I see that
[13814.82s -> 13823.05s]  I need to walk but I'm in the middle of a swing and I can't do is that
[13823.05s -> 13848.30s]  even can I I don't even know if I can block that I can't okay I thought
[13848.38s -> 13862.38s]  I hate this dark level fucking hell oh my god he just keeps doing it I can't
[13862.38s -> 13870.59s]  stop it stop it by God just cut his fucking body in half Jesus what the
[13870.59s -> 13881.63s]  hell there's somebody else in here who's the person in here what there's
[13881.63s -> 13901.79s]  like a enemy right here who is one of those fucking idiots up there and
[13901.83s -> 13904.79s]  he's he's gonna alert I gotta throw fucking group to try to shoot this
[13904.79s -> 13922.55s]  thing I'm just gonna shoot fucking rocket at this guy all right I did it
[13922.55s -> 13935.63s]  there is a maintenance shaft up ahead use it to return to the surface no no
[13935.63s -> 13941.42s]  no don't put the rock and launch it down you fucking idiot where I wish I
[13941.42s -> 13946.20s]  could have the night vision on and have the box open so there's a guy
[13946.20s -> 13957.97s]  right there there's people on the ceiling I guess I could get if I
[13957.97s -> 13974.58s]  throw a MP grenade and I've run by I have a few of them electromagnetic or
[13974.58s -> 13986.34s]  jamming no it's this one oh boy I have no idea okay well I hope I'm
[13986.34s -> 14003.69s]  throwing this in the right spot well that didn't that distracted him is it
[14003.69s -> 14010.86s]  was it enough I meant away I don't really maybe I can just go by
[14010.86s -> 14017.38s]  without fighting or trying stealth kill it's not gonna see me right here
[14017.38s -> 14024.30s]  right I don't know if this is the right time to go in but I have to turn this
[14024.30s -> 14028.67s]  off I need to wait till he starts walking again because this has to go
[14028.67s -> 14052.16s]  off and then how am I gonna can stealth kill big guy and it's like
[14052.16s -> 14070.05s]  people all over the ceiling and they're all over me shit yes way I have
[14070.05s -> 14075.57s]  to do I think I can't I can't move I have to dodge you can't do any
[14075.57s -> 14081.31s]  animations to do anything in this game I have to not be moving to
[14081.31s -> 14117.63s]  parry or to dodge I don't know how did I not dodge that I'm not gonna get
[14117.63s -> 14121.71s]  fucking dropped again get me out of this level for God's sake give me a zero I
[14121.71s -> 14130.06s]  don't care I hate this place I'll take a fucking zero pitch black stealth
[14130.06s -> 14146.14s]  mission get me the fuck out of here it would appear your only way forward
[14146.14s -> 14150.66s]  is to return to the surface you will exit into an evacuated commercial
[14150.66s -> 14155.22s]  district security is heavy but you need not worry about collateral damage
[14155.22s -> 14160.86s]  when engaging the enemy about time finally I can cut loose proceed to the
[14160.86s -> 14165.14s]  right from the exit you will find a stairway on your right those stairs
[14165.14s -> 14169.58s]  lead to a shortcut to world martial headquarters do not be distracted by
[14169.58s -> 14174.90s]  the advertisements you are not here as a tourist sure I'll just buy a quick
[14174.90s -> 14178.34s]  souvenir or two for Rose and that'll go back to fucking Power Rangers

[14282.37s -> 14298.02s]  ago I would have liked I would play something else

[14316.34s -> 14327.94s]  camera ah like when you have to hit up an X to carry and you end up
[14327.94s -> 14343.38s]  hitting saw it like right because we're what why did that have to what
[14343.38s -> 14401.97s]  did that do that for what a weird route you does that why did you that
[14401.97s -> 14409.96s]  was the oddest route he's just got shot by his own guy I'll take I'll take the
[14409.96s -> 14420.37s]  victory
[14428.61s -> 14438.24s]  I actually have prompt to back say I don't like fighting the dog it's a
[14438.24s -> 14458.10s]  problem dog it's the great point of the story where he turns do it like for
[14458.10s -> 14463.30s]  instance why come on I can't parry when I have to press that
[14463.30s -> 14494.20s]  fuck are you trying to parry with why no I'm trying it's forward it's
[14494.76s -> 14501.12s]  X to parry right or like towards where they are when the camera like like rips
[14501.12s -> 14506.16s]  around they add point two seconds when you press the button the right button
[14506.16s -> 14522.38s]  that you think you're pressing it goes the other direction jet stream Sam
[14522.38s -> 14559.30s]  happy new year fucking Snoke my sword is a means to an end to protect those
[14559.86s -> 14567.90s]  prey on really let me ask those sidewalls you've killed up to now maybe
[14567.90s -> 14572.46s]  they weren't kids but they were you ever think about them when you're
[14572.46s -> 14583.22s]  chopping them into hamburger their adults they made their choice right on
[14583.22s -> 14588.62s]  the dotted line their BMC contract usually they're no strangers to all in
[14588.62s -> 14594.45s]  fact many times they already lost a leave or two many times they were out
[14594.45s -> 14602.29s]  of work and starving on the street so yes they keep appearing on other pieces
[14602.29s -> 14607.17s]  of media somebody there's a tech director that's changing cameras here
[14607.17s -> 14612.71s]  this is a whole production down on pivoting nanomachines sent right into
[14612.71s -> 14619.78s]  the blender they made their choice right open your
[14621.05s -> 14627.73s]  camera two in three twenty two one camera switch
[14644.28s -> 14654.70s]  can we take on the meme thing you guys are the meme part of the game
[14664.92s -> 14667.92s]  die
[14674.39s -> 14677.99s]  well which one is it dude
[14677.99s -> 14681.87s]  he took my leg

[14714.70s -> 14738.61s]  shut up Boris he did it for you what am I who shot me who shot me I want
[14738.61s -> 14749.90s]  another name

[14766.64s -> 14775.64s]  psycho why am I psycho just doing what I'm supposed to be doing
[14775.64s -> 14790.38s]  right are you injured I thought they had a choice a fair choice not like
[14790.38s -> 14792.70s]  you I don't want this like he's out there
[14824.63s -> 14841.67s]  but I'm not doing the course of mankind half man half machine five percent
[14841.67s -> 14848.75s]  together on three previous missions he proved most capable you think highly
[14850.50s -> 14855.43s]  so wait that's just not me in like a cool suit
[14855.43s -> 14861.91s]  until now scouting data for the next area I thought he just had like a cool
[14861.91s -> 14878.74s]  job he saw him he's in a suit I like a costume it's just a costume
[14878.74s -> 14883.42s]  your current emotional state appears highly volatile I am sure you do not
[14883.42s -> 14887.62s]  intend to get out here but I suggest you avoid combat for the time being
[14887.62s -> 14897.02s]  oh man not I don't want to do another avoid combat mission yeah I can hear
[14897.02s -> 14900.42s]  the nanomachines I know that riding is a robot I know I'm just kidding
[14900.42s -> 14934.78s]  around I'm just ahead what's we got any I used to train his cover why

[14948.50s -> 14953.78s]  of this area what you want to do what can I do right now besides walk and
[14953.78s -> 14963.16s]  grab item and go to next I'm not gonna throw a grenade at somebody make
[14963.16s -> 14984.80s]  us laugh can I jump I can't jump when I'm sad I can't go in the box when
[14984.80s -> 15001.33s]  I'm sad either I don't think there's any way I can avoid these guys but
[15001.33s -> 15051.98s]  say something like yoinky hurry up quick say yoinky I'm gonna die okay well
[15051.98s -> 15059.34s]  the cutscenes happening so we're gonna stop right
[15059.34s -> 15064.86s]  now is it is your cause just or is that just what you tell yourself fuck
[15064.86s -> 15071.14s]  you he's so bad he was into a basic enemy how pleased you are to chop
[15071.14s -> 15085.13s]  away I mean my name is monsoon of the winds of destruction yeah I guessed
[15085.37s -> 15088.97s]  much here comes the mean
[15092.75s -> 15100.33s]  yeah he just he's tapping
[15105.92s -> 15118.50s]  Raymond so that was the funny thing that was the thing that everyone's
[15118.50s -> 15122.98s]  losing their minds about does he say something feasting on the insides of
[15122.98s -> 15128.24s]  your enemies how easily you ignore the loss of life when it suits your
[15128.24s -> 15134.85s]  convenience so tell me who saves the week from the man who saves the
[15134.89s -> 15142.81s]  week you're the ones exploiting them you take advantage of their weakness of
[15142.81s -> 15152.02s]  course they get hurt when you set them up as your human shield kill or be killed
[15152.02s -> 15160.58s]  Jack
[15163.58s -> 15168.89s]  like a camera mode activated
[15169.33s -> 15174.21s]  its final lesson is carved deep in my psyche and this world and all its
[15174.21s -> 15181.57s]  people are diseased okay free will is a myth religion is a joke look right
[15181.57s -> 15185.64s]  controlled by something me I mean these people standing here when you

[15245.94s -> 15266.33s]  be ashamed it's only nature running its course the whole speech was about
[15266.33s -> 15276.11s]  memes about me I mean I knew something was how did I miss it I was looking at
[15276.11s -> 15279.99s]  the cat I could walk off the battlefield and I thought the cat was
[15279.99s -> 15285.67s]  the meme but here I am surrounded by death arguing philosophy with
[15285.67s -> 15290.79s]  terrorists I told myself this was about justice about protecting the
[15290.79s -> 15295.07s]  weak but I was wrong look when everybody is screaming here comes the
[15295.07s -> 15299.75s]  meme here comes the meme and a cat shows up on screen I learned young that's
[15299.75s -> 15302.67s]  the meme to me good you know what I'm saying that's that's what the joke

[16219.80s -> 16229.62s]  problems there the dark room the that's fine I don't like that chapter I like
[16229.62s -> 16234.46s]  the meme boss I mean he was fun there are three or four areas in that I would
[16234.46s -> 16253.70s]  just you know what I mean I got tactical Psy dystopia unlocked ooh I'm
[16253.70s -> 16273.30s]  gonna try that up so main weapon and then unique weapon I still mean this

[16280.83s -> 16285.47s]  Lawrence force following Fleming's left hand rule for motors his force is
[16285.51s -> 16293.13s]  generated by a magnetic field I want to try I could be Raphael from the Ninja
[16293.13s -> 16300.60s]  Turtles and I'm gonna enhance it strength one strength two strength
[16300.60s -> 16312.34s]  three Mike doing something wrong well now how I'm gonna use it now all
[16312.34s -> 16324.31s]  right make sure it's quick 20,000 for enhance I need these upgrades guys I
[16324.31s -> 16376.58s]  do and I can do this and I have it on
[16376.78s -> 16411.31s]  what the hell does this thing do oh it's fake okay watch out ripper mode
[16411.35s -> 16414.72s]  okay
[16436.30s -> 16451.85s]  guess it's kind of like spider-man you got in the way you dick really how is
[16451.85s -> 16456.53s]  that not okay I'm a little bit confused here I'm trying to figure out
[16456.73s -> 16491.51s]  it was like too far away you're off the screen
[16492.79s -> 16507.54s]  thank that's great well that was a good in the care of that was fun
[16507.54s -> 16531.77s]  apparently you've wasted it somehow I got traveling two rockets and yeah it's
[16531.81s -> 16535.29s]  unfortunate that I just upgraded this three times I I don't I really don't
[16535.29s -> 16566.95s]  like it thank you classic waste all the money joke well wasn't really a joke I
[16566.95s -> 16570.96s]  thought it was gonna I thought it was a melee weapon I didn't think it was
[16570.96s -> 16596.32s]  kind of like I thought it was replacing does the staff replace the elevators
[16596.32s -> 16602.40s]  appear to be disabled which we should have expected I suppose I will access
[16602.40s -> 16606.60s]  the control unit perhaps you can hack an elevator and make it operational
[16606.60s -> 16613.60s]  who splendid idea by all means yes it seems the guards are storming the
[16613.60s -> 16621.92s]  building okay do not stray too far from the elevators right and use the
[16621.92s -> 16625.12s]  weapons around you to slow them down all right well I can't get them you
[16625.12s -> 16633.79s]  can so I might as well just use this as well yes give them hell the guy
[16633.79s -> 16639.06s]  already up here because it's a guy behind me is he just hitting me right
[16639.26s -> 16694.50s]  probably that's a dental arm I really need to be using this guy behind a
[16694.50s -> 16709.66s]  force field no he's just out of reach can I shoot him in the feet and kill
[16709.66s -> 16723.67s]  him come on why can I aim it up like half an inch higher he's still on the
[16723.67s -> 16750.46s]  stairs is he gonna get up console FBF well first you tell me don't leave the
[16750.46s -> 16753.42s]  elevator and they tell me go we go to the elevator and then you stop them
[16753.42s -> 16757.06s]  from getting in the elevator get in the elevator stop talking to her the
[16757.06s -> 16759.10s]  cutscenes
[16759.14s -> 16765.06s]  the lower insists of offices and meeting space for staff and visitors while
[16765.06s -> 16769.10s]  confidential military projects and technical research are restricted to the
[16769.10s -> 16773.26s]  upper levels so that's where the brains in the server room will be up top
[16773.26s -> 16779.26s]  indeed but that elevator can only access the lower floors you need to
[16779.26s -> 16782.70s]  get to the 20th floor and pass the security gate they are to reach the
[16782.70s -> 16788.22s]  upper area let me guess time to find another left hand well that is
[16788.78s -> 16793.46s]  security cyborgs would not have sufficient clearance but managers and
[16793.46s -> 16799.42s]  senior staff have already been evacuated no doubt so the only option is to cut
[16799.42s -> 16804.40s]  the power to the security gate which will not be easy it is powered by no
[16804.40s -> 16808.36s]  less than three systems including a backup power supply you will need to
[16808.36s -> 16812.06s]  destroy all of the electrical control panels to disable them in any
[16812.10s -> 16819.66s]  case you should arrive at the 20th floor soon a lot of grenades the
[16819.66s -> 16823.62s]  electrical panels are most likely hidden in the walls use your enhanced
[16823.62s -> 16828.98s]  AR to search for any unusual heat sources inside the walls there
[16828.98s -> 16858.66s]  unusual heat sources all right I'm just going in well I looked at it
[16858.66s -> 16888.19s]  there you go get out of the way give me my item that I just found give
[16888.19s -> 16939.74s]  my item oh whoops okay the heat sources rocket launchers gotta go I
[16939.74s -> 16955.74s]  know this where the dog come from why is it like a dog in here now okay I
[16955.74s -> 17007.38s]  gonna run away from me we don't know you don't too many people to parry
[17007.38s -> 17014.06s]  too much going on oh boy am I gonna die here I think I'm dead here I'm like
[17014.06s -> 17030.41s]  walking the corner I got other shit going on right yeah I can't really do
[17030.41s -> 17071.75s]  anything I don't I don't know where it's trying to get in space but it's
[17071.75s -> 17080.87s]  trying to get you to face the poster that I'm not so sure about
[17080.99s -> 17102.83s]  bug got on my back really all right now where do I go look for the heat heat
[17102.83s -> 17111.19s]  look at the heat on the walls there should be an electrical panel nearby use
[17111.19s -> 17129.82s]  your enhanced AR to locate it knows boxing okay sure
[17129.82s -> 17134.50s]  one down two to go I already see one of those I thought I would try to
[17134.50s -> 17143.86s]  swing it one there should be an electrical panel nearby use your
[17143.86s -> 17154.66s]  enhanced AR to locate it excellent just one more people coming in no all
[17154.66s -> 17202.20s]  right one two three that was not a pretty good that was not a good
[17202.20s -> 17236.27s]  telegraph right there still alive I think he's dead no little worms in there
[17236.27s -> 17267.07s]  my last one I thought there was one back here but I'm probably crazy
[17267.07s -> 17333.63s]  we go hey hurray how much more of the game do I got what's uh what's left I
[17333.63s -> 17350.14s]  feel like I'm getting fairly close like our two minutes left
[17350.14s -> 17355.14s]  should I activate I don't know about that now no keep them off I need it this
[17355.14s -> 17361.78s]  way well as you wish I must say I have turned more than a few men into
[17361.78s -> 17369.26s]  cyborgs but you well your past is most what you getting that doc most of
[17369.26s -> 17373.74s]  the time you're working with first world ex-military grown men compared
[17373.74s -> 17377.50s]  to the average third world child soldier I can't really complain do the
[17377.94s -> 17381.50s]  most of them they're the sort of gorillas your typical patient gets paid to
[17381.50s -> 17390.54s]  slaughter this shouldn't be news to you doc look just help me take care of
[17390.54s -> 17396.38s]  those brains after I bring him back I do my business you do yours
[17425.89s -> 17461.62s]  so go go go I'm the guy told me to run so I'm gonna run for some reason I
[17461.62s -> 17473.94s]  thought he was talking about blow the door open that's all I saw don't fight
[17473.94s -> 17484.72s]  everybody just go you know grab the RPG but oh what can I start I know I'm
[17484.72s -> 17518.30s]  fine I'm good why fight anything just run destroy the grad ain't no going
[17518.90s -> 17548.04s]  you're really easy with the electrocution knife let go and then all
[17548.04s -> 17573.92s]  these sliders in the area let go press again that's cool I'm gonna hit right
[17573.92s -> 17584.94s]  in the face by something yeah keep climbing like that it will be
[17585.50s -> 17588.50s]  that dog
[17596.89s -> 17616.29s]  all right apparently I did it I got a D there I didn't do anything I didn't
[17616.29s -> 17620.33s]  fight anybody I couldn't build points you should find an indoor garden up
[17620.33s -> 17626.17s]  ahead like garden sounds fancy a Japanese garden to be precise it is an
[17626.17s -> 17631.49s]  area set aside for VIPs apparently one of world marshals directors is a rather
[17631.49s -> 17636.45s]  serious Japanese culture enthusiast all right so what's this got to do with me
[17636.45s -> 17640.93s]  there's something I need from the garden not at all you need only pass
[17640.93s -> 17644.93s]  through that area to arrive at a freight elevator I found a route to
[17644.93s -> 17649.57s]  the elevator controls to the unit we hijacked downstairs I have located
[17650.01s -> 17674.48s]  great work doc elementary my dear right now head for the garden well fight
[17674.48s -> 17698.04s]  apparently I don't know how the second it should shut up shut up I'm trying to
[17698.04s -> 17702.24s]  hit that guy too but I can't his this guy's body was getting in the way
[17702.72s -> 17736.02s]  die with the RPG is gonna go what point blank by an RPG why these guys down
[17736.02s -> 17739.58s]  here the hell do you need to be doing that for why are you done with the
[17739.58s -> 17780.34s]  RPG you got tired that works out for me too far away shit I mean wouldn't you
[17780.34s -> 17803.48s]  say something similar at this point fuck me proceed through the garden
[17828.06s -> 17839.55s]  so many people here I wonder what the hell I should do here cuz 5,000 damn
[17839.55s -> 17851.83s]  okay um what's going on that moon that is that is a very two-dimensional moon
[17851.83s -> 17868.99s]  can I go this way I thought I could but there was a weird invisible wall I gotta
[17868.99s -> 17922.65s]  say on earth is with the stealth in this game no I don't like why okay
[17922.65s -> 17940.50s]  it's targeting this guy well why would it turn I don't even know which
[17940.50s -> 17986.34s]  way I'm going which I use I need to like do something here where is this
[17986.34s -> 17997.48s]  camera even going what is happening man come on oh my fucking Lord all right
[17997.48s -> 18002.10s]  like do we have to find these little corridors that's all there is here
[18002.10s -> 18005.10s]  there's no open place like it's like over here is the biggest place I
[18005.10s -> 18057.65s]  think gracious no don't do it keep doing that same move my god I'm gonna
[18057.65s -> 18082.46s]  scream in a second here fuck off both of you are you still alive
[18082.46s -> 18117.70s]  can I keep playing the game can I move on to another place
[18118.14s -> 18160.87s]  this looks so long go this way my crazy or something something up here no I
[18160.87s -> 18179.36s]  don't have enough power shit you don't need power I thought you do
[18179.36s -> 18189.46s]  okay apparently don't all right all is a catwalk straight ahead to reach the
[18189.46s -> 18202.56s]  elevator my apologies right I seem to have fallen behind no worries actually I
[18202.56s -> 18207.96s]  should thank you what are you talking about if it wasn't for you I wouldn't
[18207.96s -> 18215.24s]  have gotten Jack back then that is your true nature more or less still
[18215.24s -> 18220.64s]  interested I find no reason to alter my objectives from the moment we met
[18220.68s -> 18225.84s]  you have acted on emotional urges you speak of protecting those weaker than
[18225.84s -> 18231.84s]  you such people number in the billions it is impossible you cannot save every
[18231.84s -> 18236.88s]  human being in the world you cannot save every street child after
[18236.88s -> 18242.56s]  extended observation I have come to a conclusion your actions are rooted in
[18242.56s -> 18249.12s]  affinity for those from similar circumstances as yours guess so not
[18249.12s -> 18253.92s]  much of a superhero after all huh however your emotional status is
[18253.92s -> 18259.64s]  understandable perhaps I share this same affinity well if that's what you
[18259.64s -> 18265.44s]  feel then glad to have you along Roger you can reach the server room
[18265.44s -> 18292.90s]  beers afraid elevator just a hair press the button but I've watched the
[18292.90s -> 18311.61s]  arm guys where the my like my right hand hurts I might have to take a
[18311.61s -> 18341.74s]  break boomer injury so it's all like the tap wait wait tap rap use the claw
[18341.74s -> 18351.76s]  grip oh with a game like this how are you supposed to claw grip it no it's a
[18351.76s -> 18380.77s]  lot of this fight this part's gonna hurt your really no I don't want a
[18380.77s -> 18400.51s]  part that it hurts by hand that didn't happen I think of it always hurt my
[18400.51s -> 18409.36s]  fucking hand oh fuck this elevator seriously do I have to fight half the
[18409.36s -> 18416.15s]  enemies in this game these tight-ass spaces really his enemies bigger than
[18416.15s -> 18436.31s]  the screen and it's a square where one of them can fit let's go thank God
[18436.31s -> 18453.50s]  he can't fall off no I didn't want to show it to him I wanted to
[18453.50s -> 18478.18s]  roll the grenade I'm about to restart just kill me after he started just kill
[18478.18s -> 18501.28s]  me you're supposed to be stronger than this all right let's go trying to
[18501.28s -> 18522.14s]  parry yeah go sicko mode no no no I have to wait for those big guys to
[18522.14s -> 18540.02s]  get here I gotta take a break this game is so much this is like playing dark
[18540.02s -> 18564.96s]  souls at like times five speed my brain is just like slowing down get to
[18564.96s -> 18579.02s]  the next boss well if I can get off his elevator we'll see maybe now I'm
[18579.02s -> 18635.92s]  gonna activate you just have cutscenes like it's a really tall building yeah
[18635.92s -> 18670.80s]  it is how did you get me don't care about the
[18670.84s -> 18672.84s]  here
[18677.58s -> 18700.34s]  one kind of you I might actually have to turn it on here I hate fighting the dog
[18700.34s -> 18729.10s]  stop running around huh the one you know I'm gonna do anything the one
[18729.10s -> 18741.61s]  time that I want you to come on I just fat-fingered the whole entire
[18741.61s -> 18752.81s]  control porn in chat again well I think that's strike three guys I think
[18752.81s -> 18778.94s]  I'm gonna have to disable links permanently why would you baby with that
[18778.94s -> 18783.74s]  why would you tell me this porn in the chat we've got an issue already
[18783.74s -> 18795.78s]  speed why what hey we already had a good issue with that shit
[18798.46s -> 18822.15s]  they can't do this or I just turn it off I'm just mashing excellent by
[18822.15s -> 18839.22s]  the elevator sequence how do I know what porn is I went I had a class
[18839.26s -> 18859.74s]  when the class talked about pornography things that they talked about I don't
[18859.74s -> 18865.07s]  even know what enemies are fighting me right now lying around shooting missiles
[18865.07s -> 18874.84s]  there's three fucking vultures it's time it's time to fuck it for like a
[18874.84s -> 18878.84s]  grenade or something holy shit I just threw it over I threw it over boy
[18878.84s -> 18886.00s]  oh man what are you even supposed to do about this reliably Jesus man I
[18886.00s -> 18894.22s]  don't even know what the fuck I'm gonna shoot at just shoot it who
[18894.22s -> 18934.52s]  cares I hate these big guys I'm actually the worst
[18994.68s -> 19012.36s]  just kill him anything else here it was real there was a real porn why do we
[19012.36s -> 19018.16s]  have to have this problem now guys I've had links in chat for almost three
[19018.16s -> 19022.96s]  or four years server rooms ahead yes and you tell me that three years later
[19022.96s -> 19027.24s]  I expect to find if they're VR training those brains I'm guessing it
[19027.24s -> 19031.40s]  won't look like your typical IT department quite right most of it
[19031.40s -> 19035.32s]  will likely be occupied by life support units feeding oxygen and
[19035.32s -> 19038.44s]  nutrition to the brains they have stored you know they would also need
[19038.44s -> 19042.88s]  a server to feed them to be our data but in terms of structure it's
[19042.88s -> 19049.72s]  really more brain storage but no doubt it makes a convenient euphemism for what
[19049.72s -> 19054.52s]  they are really doing there yeah like how CIA agents refer to where they work
[19054.52s -> 19058.92s]  as the company indeed something like that would never arouse the
[19058.92s -> 19062.84s]  suspicions of rank-and-file staff who may hear it and I'm sure those
[19062.84s -> 19067.28s]  complicit in this operation feel better not calling it the VR training
[19067.28s -> 19072.16s]  room even something so simple as a name can help one ignore the truth of
[19072.16s -> 19077.64s]  what they are doing truly fascinating how the human brain works so this whatever
[19077.64s -> 19082.60s]  room that's where sundowners waiting right if he wants a fight I wish he'd
[19082.60s -> 19085.64s]  just get on with it he didn't seem the time to run and
[19085.64s -> 19090.64s]  hide then he is in charge of security but I suspect this is not about
[19090.64s -> 19095.32s]  business if I had to guess I would say he's toying with you testing you
[19095.32s -> 19099.32s]  perhaps whatever he's doing it won't change what's going to happen once I
[19099.32s -> 19104.28s]  finally catch up with them all right so give me a second I gotta like get a
[19104.28s -> 19108.56s]  glass of water I get to break I'll be back in like two minutes I'm gonna pee
[19108.56s -> 19113.96s]  grab a jar of water this is this is this games like lighting my neurons up
[19113.96s -> 19121.28s]  in my brain no porn links in this chat if this if I come back there's
[19121.28s -> 19130.05s]  a porn link you're all in deep shit don't don't do that I'll be right
[19130.05s -> 19333.14s]  back all right hello change like the lighting in here I think the
[19333.14s -> 19338.29s]  lighting is like fucking with my head they'd have like the ideal lighting
[19338.29s -> 19359.50s]  what was ideal lighting I don't know all right hello yeah I just needed to
[19359.50s -> 19365.81s]  take a second this game is this game's a lot of fun but it's kind of
[19365.81s -> 19373.14s]  like I'm melting and at some point it's just like
[19377.14s -> 19388.27s]  fires off a lot of shit in the brain really fast I think it's a good game
[19388.31s -> 19406.83s]  brain can't take it I think I'm good though I just needed to look away for it
[19406.83s -> 19417.69s]  from it for like a minute or two grab some water you know chill how you think
[19417.69s -> 19426.65s]  secure I was gonna feel definitely a lot slower than this but I don't know
[19426.65s -> 19434.25s]  it's it's kind of the same realm as the early games right I think the
[19434.25s -> 19438.73s]  sound design makes it really overwhelming yeah we'll see if I can
[19438.73s -> 19458.71s]  do the whole game
[19465.51s -> 19475.15s]  well got it they're all getting back on top of her head I gotta kill them all
[19475.15s -> 19478.47s]  before they get back she has a good I don't know what the hell's happening
[19478.47s -> 19491.03s]  I'll take it I'll take the victory BD so I gotta fight this this isn't like
[19491.03s -> 19508.10s]  a boss brush is it this is boss brush don't let her get it I don't really

[19524.50s -> 19567.29s]  no no no no don't wanna get away only two bosses yeah still still a rush
[19567.29s -> 19584.22s]  still a boss run they only need it with some water do you understand the
[19584.22s -> 19588.18s]  whole hydrate mean thing I understand it now you got it I was turning it I
[19588.18s -> 19628.26s]  was shriveling up there come back down lady hey lady I gotta get a good
[19628.26s -> 19644.25s]  walk walk it do something what are you doing why are you standing still zero
[19644.25s -> 19663.07s]  point zero point zero point one percent got it now what oh it is a bit is a
[19663.07s -> 19670.98s]  boss brush that was a stupid joke I was making it really is actually is a
[19670.98s -> 19676.98s]  lot lower and I don't drink didn't drink enough water for this shit

[19742.23s -> 19794.58s]  whoo oh not the foot first sweet got it I didn't go ever I didn't get like a
[19794.58s -> 19817.10s]  super cool kill but I still did it all right late mode does less damage I
[19817.10s -> 19823.84s]  don't wanna miss anything people get really mad when I miss something I'm
[19823.84s -> 19829.08s]  sorry I'm sorry I do I just said I'm sorry this thing's up there
[19829.36s -> 19841.34s]  late mode is not meant for dealing damage you know I use blade mo because
[19841.34s -> 19847.40s]  it makes me feel safe it's so slow don't disrupt the students while class
[19847.40s -> 19854.06s]  is in session I believe familiar with the lesson plan the same regimen you
[19854.06s -> 19858.74s]  went through in Liberia right is fighting this guy program just look
[19858.74s -> 19864.38s]  how you turned out of course running it in the real world just got a bit
[19864.42s -> 19867.38s]  you missed a diamond
[19868.46s -> 19874.62s]  virtually though no fuss no must straight to the brain
[19874.62s -> 19884.50s]  it's like a dream well maybe dream is the wrong word to kill some POWs some
[19884.50s -> 19895.74s]  civilians we give their pleasure centers nice big joke every time plus
[19895.78s -> 19902.62s]  they can shine a new body is a graduation present wait did I just get
[19902.62s -> 19909.74s]  the whole thing you haven't come I chose this that kid's you son of a
[19909.74s -> 19917.22s]  bitch and kids did rock don't make me laugh
[19917.22s -> 19921.94s]  lose touch with it as they get older start thinking they know right wrong
[19922.26s -> 19930.70s]  that's immoral war crime this code of conduct that kids you can mold
[19930.70s -> 19936.14s]  manipulate it performing all kinds of atrocities and there's nothing like a
[19936.14s -> 19944.23s]  good atrocity to keep a war going that's why I'm shutting you down you
[19944.23s -> 19953.93s]  just don't see the bigger picture do you say you bring this whole place
[19954.81s -> 19961.34s]  what's out of the rubble with all these precious brains
[19961.34s -> 19971.67s]  nothing changes all the guys in charge of long gone we've got offices around
[19971.67s -> 19978.53s]  the world which one of these Harry Potter things to act to find we're
[19978.53s -> 19986.77s]  just support we don't create the market for war and who does the
[19986.81s -> 19993.97s]  patriots are gone those guys just manage the war economy they did not
[19993.97s -> 19999.73s]  create it did you think every battle in history was all part of some big
[19999.73s -> 20009.83s]  old conspiracy bullshit war is just part of who we are why fight it
[20009.83s -> 20015.12s]  none of this will matter in three hours demand for PMC's is about to
[20015.12s -> 20022.86s]  scar like the good old days after 9-eleven what are you talking about
[20022.86s -> 20035.51s]  not here follow me okay right then get sundowner do not lose it this time
[20035.51s -> 20045.39s]  don't lose it but wait I'm gonna have to lose him for a second because his

[20108.46s -> 20115.86s]  and ball I'll upgrade because I feel like I'm probably getting close to
[20115.86s -> 20120.81s]  one of those second to last areas hopefully just don't put me all the
[20120.93s -> 20160.52s]  bird up why did I read that okay fuel cells they're all good I'm gonna go to
[20160.52s -> 20167.44s]  skills though because this much that I don't have sweep kick Thunderstrike
[20170.61s -> 20194.76s]  whole arm falling lightning diving down the air weapon 200,000 I don't have
[20194.92s -> 20206.86s]  enough strength plus three how much is this 16,000 I'm just gonna upgrade this
[20206.86s -> 20216.75s]  few times really need it then I have enough for one of the skills right
[20216.75s -> 20236.97s]  Thunderstrike channel air pressure into a shockwave sure and sweep kick let
[20236.97s -> 20255.35s]  me see what this does right then get sundowner hold on let me just take a
[20255.39s -> 20276.82s]  look on the list Thunderstrike this is left stick up down X okay what about the
[20276.82s -> 20291.23s]  other one sky high is up up X did I get any other sweet right I think I've
[20291.23s -> 20312.42s]  done this accidentally a couple times blade how do I pick stabbing despair
[20312.42s -> 20321.53s]  and then after throw dash I mean it's just there's only two moves take off
[20321.53s -> 20333.85s]  side yeah yeah well I have enough to upgrade the other weapon to the
[20333.85s -> 20339.76s]  night of 2000 everyone I thought for some reason I thought I had 20,000
[20339.76s -> 20359.94s]  nevermind right then get sundowner do not lose it this time should I just go
[20359.94s -> 20378.15s]  to none right all right here we go make sure I didn't miss anything I'm
[20378.15s -> 20390.13s]  too paranoid about that okey-dokey we need to go up here
[20390.13s -> 20402.77s]  be nice if you could do the whole thing so I wonder how hard this
[20402.77s -> 20422.62s]  boss fight will house this Jack we can play up here without damaging the
[20422.62s -> 20429.34s]  merchandise what happens in three hours who the hell was that the Jack is
[20429.34s -> 20436.26s]  talking you're too late even at Mach 2 you wouldn't make it kill it that was
[20436.26s -> 20442.38s]  a joke take some time what happened in three hours
[20442.38s -> 20451.82s]  I don't want to hear that again this whole game is a joke take those back
[20451.86s -> 20460.61s]  solar panels that's how we charge
[20469.56s -> 20484.02s]  okay I'll try it you can be cooler than that
[20484.02s -> 20509.26s]  check play with me good how a copy back there is kind of a problem
[20509.30s -> 20514.42s]  right keep your blade away from the chill all right keep my blade away from
[20514.42s -> 20516.70s]  the shield
[20518.82s -> 20529.01s]  I cut the shields off I chopped the shield off all right so he does that
[20529.01s -> 20535.29s]  in the right spot with your place maybe you can drop his gun
[20535.41s -> 20542.62s]  I see okay all right um does it have to be a helicopter here like why is this
[20542.62s -> 20554.29s]  here just to be annoying isn't it no I just get rid of this thing
[20554.29s -> 20578.50s]  out of here let's go all right after I do that he trying to not hit him
[20578.50s -> 20632.35s]  again after that right behind him oh god damn it no all right get that thing

[20743.59s -> 20747.07s]  we didn't have it and like flipped all over the place
[20747.07s -> 20751.07s]  I might as well just die and just do it again don't do it, just try it next time
[20751.07s -> 20767.33s]  do I have enable heals?
[20767.33s -> 20769.33s]  I know
[20769.33s -> 20771.33s]  you're not gonna be able to help me
[20771.33s -> 20773.33s]  yeah I'll just do it again
[20773.33s -> 20779.68s]  to be stronger than this you can be cooler than that

[20861.20s -> 20871.71s]  and just me aiming with the right stick somehow is impossible
[20871.71s -> 20873.71s]  like I'm so close to him

[21013.39s -> 21015.95s]  I'm gonna be very very
[21015.95s -> 21031.50s]  fly along the side of the building
[21031.50s -> 21048.85s]  that hurt
[21048.85s -> 21050.85s]  I guess I'll come in
[21050.85s -> 21053.02s]  I thought it was gonna be one cut
[21053.02s -> 21055.02s]  I thought it was gonna be one cut

[21110.99s -> 21112.99s]  operation
[21112.99s -> 21114.99s]  to cum se
[21114.99s -> 21116.99s]  who?
[21116.99s -> 21118.99s]  armstrong
[21118.99s -> 21120.99s]  armstrong has too much
[21120.99s -> 21124.32s]  have a call
[21124.32s -> 21126.32s]  to make
[21126.32s -> 21128.32s]  got yourself shaving?
[21130.32s -> 21132.32s]  asshole
[21132.32s -> 21141.07s]  real
[21141.07s -> 21143.07s]  you knew this would happen
[21143.07s -> 21145.07s]  didn't you?
[21145.07s -> 21149.41s]  well
[21149.41s -> 21151.41s]  you'll get your wish
[21151.41s -> 21154.03s]  up to you now
[21154.03s -> 21159.02s]  final boss incoming
[21159.02s -> 21161.02s]  I've taken martial HQ
[21161.02s -> 21163.02s]  final boss
[21163.02s -> 21165.02s]  incoming
[21165.02s -> 21167.02s]  hurry
[21167.02s -> 21169.02s]  what sundowner said?
[21169.02s -> 21171.02s]  I know
[21171.02s -> 21173.02s]  anything that'll rival 9-11
[21173.02s -> 21175.02s]  cannot be good
[21175.02s -> 21177.33s]  maybe less
[21177.33s -> 21179.33s]  he said even maktu could not get there in time
[21179.33s -> 21181.33s]  if he was serious that's
[21181.33s -> 21183.33s]  over 4000 miles away
[21183.33s -> 21185.33s]  4500
[21185.33s -> 21187.33s]  so whatever it is it's not happening on American soil
[21187.33s -> 21189.33s]  if it's gonna spike demand
[21189.33s -> 21191.33s]  for PMC's it's gotta be a political hot spot
[21191.33s -> 21193.33s]  a coup or civil war
[21193.33s -> 21195.33s]  in a stable region wouldn't have a domino effect
[21195.33s -> 21197.33s]  and they'd want to draw in a super power
[21197.33s -> 21201.54s]  what?
[21201.54s -> 21203.54s]  president
[21203.54s -> 21205.54s]  he's on his way to Pakistan
[21205.54s -> 21207.54s]  what happens to him there?
[21207.54s -> 21209.54s]  oh shit
[21209.54s -> 21211.54s]  the war on terror part two
[21211.54s -> 21213.54s]  contact the military
[21213.54s -> 21215.54s]  official channels are frozen since Mexico
[21215.54s -> 21217.54s]  unofficial channels would take too long
[21217.54s -> 21219.54s]  besides what's our proof?
[21219.54s -> 21221.54s]  who's gonna believe us over world marsh?
[21221.54s -> 21223.54s]  then we have to get there first
[21223.54s -> 21225.54s]  impossible
[21225.54s -> 21227.54s]  it is the other side of the planet
[21227.54s -> 21229.54s]  even if we were in the world's fastest jet right now
[21229.54s -> 21231.54s]  it's not even close
[21231.54s -> 21233.54s]  hold up
[21233.54s -> 21235.78s]  did you get me?
[21256.06s -> 21258.06s]  it's fast
[21258.06s -> 21262.42s]  it's really fast
[21262.42s -> 21265.55s]  b-a-d-a-c-b-c-s-a-v
[21265.55s -> 21267.55s]  that's all over the place
[21267.55s -> 21269.55s]  I took that test drunk
[21269.55s -> 21287.15s]  custom cyborg party
[21287.15s -> 21289.52s]  okay
[21289.52s -> 21292.21s]  I got his weapons
[21292.21s -> 21294.45s]  and his armor
[21294.45s -> 21312.74s]  how much is it?
[21312.74s -> 21314.74s]  custom cyborg 15,000
[21314.74s -> 21323.81s]  so what's the difference here?
[21323.81s -> 21327.52s]  I don't have enough to do that
[21327.52s -> 21332.58s]  just a different color
[21332.58s -> 21339.74s]  well what's the weapon?
[21339.74s -> 21341.74s]  pincer blades
[21341.74s -> 21343.74s]  pair of giant high frequency machetes
[21343.74s -> 21345.74s]  that can be combined to form massive shears
[21345.74s -> 21347.74s]  so in motion they are particularly effective
[21347.74s -> 21349.74s]  at catching their prey off guard
[21349.74s -> 21351.98s]  developed after careful analysis
[21351.98s -> 21353.98s]  of sundowners battle data
[21353.98s -> 21363.76s]  10,000?
[21363.76s -> 21366.70s]  not good, I wonder if they're good
[21366.70s -> 21370.48s]  I'm gonna try it
[21370.48s -> 21372.48s]  I'm not gonna put the upgrades on it yet
[21372.48s -> 21374.48s]  but I am gonna know I'm not
[21374.48s -> 21379.60s]  because it's 40,000
[21379.60s -> 21390.14s]  turbulence
[21390.14s -> 21393.02s]  I don't have enough, I need to level up
[21418.08s -> 21420.70s]  man of many talents
[21420.70s -> 21429.58s]  this kind of
[21429.58s -> 21431.58s]  space launch once required days
[21431.58s -> 21433.58s]  of preparation
[21433.58s -> 21435.58s]  solus has been conducting test flights almost every day for the last
[21435.58s -> 21437.58s]  six months
[21437.58s -> 21439.58s]  as long as we're not breaking atmosphere
[21439.58s -> 21441.58s]  they said they can reroute today's flight no problem
[21441.58s -> 21443.58s]  amazing
[21443.58s -> 21445.58s]  the earth is the cradle of humanity
[21445.58s -> 21447.58s]  but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever
[21447.58s -> 21449.58s]  I'm only going as far as the
[21449.58s -> 21451.58s]  thermosphere
[21451.58s -> 21453.58s]  this thing can't pass the karman line
[21453.58s -> 21455.58s]  this mission will just have to wait
[21455.58s -> 21457.58s]  and here I was hoping you might bring me back
[21457.58s -> 21460.46s]  a monolith
[21460.46s -> 21462.46s]  scheisse, two bogeys closing fast
[21462.46s -> 21464.46s]  uh oh
[21464.46s -> 21466.46s]  who else? the flight pattern suggests
[21466.46s -> 21468.46s]  unmanned incorporate 20s
[21468.46s -> 21476.66s]  this is a transport chopper
[21476.66s -> 21478.66s]  our defensive options are limited
[21478.66s -> 21480.66s]  I didn't say sam, I said saaam
[21480.66s -> 21482.66s]  with a capital
[21482.66s -> 21484.66s]  M
[21484.66s -> 21486.66s]  missiles incoming
[21486.66s -> 21500.61s]  yes, but not
[21500.61s -> 21502.61s]  I'm strong enough to kick out the drone
[21510.74s -> 21515.28s]  here they come
[21515.28s -> 21517.97s]  this? I didn't
[21517.97s -> 21520.46s]  have a nice flight
[21520.46s -> 21522.46s]  and people say Germans aren't funny
[21522.46s -> 21525.47s]  when did I say that?
[21525.47s -> 21543.65s]  one guy said that
[21543.65s -> 21545.65s]  there it is
[21550.72s -> 21552.72s]  alright, bring the chopper around
[21552.72s -> 21601.36s]  this is easier said than done
[21601.36s -> 21603.36s]  you know
[21603.36s -> 21605.66s]  do you mind living with me?
[21605.66s -> 21618.02s]  yeah sure
[21618.02s -> 21620.02s]  yeah sure
[21620.02s -> 21628.66s]  yeah sure
[21628.66s -> 21656.62s]  nooooo
[21656.62s -> 21659.63s]  I got out of here
[21659.63s -> 21661.63s]  I'm sorry my friend
[21661.63s -> 21663.63s]  your sacrifice will not be forgotten
[21665.63s -> 21674.98s]  that was quite the fall Raiden
[21674.98s -> 21676.98s]  I'm glad to see that you are alright
[21676.98s -> 21678.98s]  it's time you got out of
[21678.98s -> 21681.79s]  Denver
[21681.79s -> 21689.22s]  enemies
[21689.22s -> 21691.65s]  clean out
[21691.65s -> 21695.68s]  I'll take it
[21695.68s -> 21697.68s]  play as a docker
[21697.68s -> 21700.11s]  wouldn't that be something
[21700.11s -> 21702.11s]  if there wasn't a guy behind me
[21702.11s -> 21704.11s]  I would have got that guy in one hells world
[21704.11s -> 21707.44s]  I'm not even getting the right guy
[21707.44s -> 21719.92s]  use pincher?
[21719.92s -> 21721.92s]  well I didn't really get a chance to
[21721.92s -> 21723.92s]  go into my menu
[21723.92s -> 21725.92s]  I kind of got attacked immediately
[21725.92s -> 21727.92s]  oops
[21727.92s -> 21737.39s]  oops
[21737.39s -> 21744.99s]  so it is on
[21744.99s -> 21746.99s]  I can charge up
[21746.99s -> 21748.99s]  there's a slow
[21748.99s -> 21750.99s]  can people stop calling me?
[21750.99s -> 21752.99s]  Mike can you talk to me on the move?
[21774.99s -> 21776.99s]  I know
[21776.99s -> 21778.99s]  let me just worry about putting some distance
[21778.99s -> 21780.99s]  between me and world marshal
[21780.99s -> 21784.83s]  and what's left of it
[21784.83s -> 21786.83s]  you could have emailed that to me
[21786.83s -> 21789.26s]  I'm a 20 billion dollar
[21789.26s -> 21791.26s]  cyber ninja
[21791.26s -> 21793.26s]  okay
[21793.26s -> 21795.26s]  you can email me that and it'll just download into my brain
[21795.26s -> 21797.26s]  and I won't even need to hear you talk
[21797.26s -> 21811.92s]  okay well I'm turning this shit on
[21811.92s -> 21820.88s]  and that whole animation
[21820.88s -> 21822.88s]  lasts too long
[21822.88s -> 21824.88s]  to the point where now I get a fight
[21824.88s -> 21830.51s]  why does it need to do that?
[21830.51s -> 21862.26s]  get off the lock on there
[21862.26s -> 21866.86s]  get off that lock on
[21866.86s -> 21868.86s]  well I
[21868.86s -> 21884.10s]  those are very slow aren't they?
[21890.11s -> 21892.80s]  and now you're in big trouble
[21892.80s -> 21901.89s]  two heals
[21901.89s -> 21903.89s]  that's not good
[21903.89s -> 21923.57s]  no
[21923.57s -> 21933.36s]  I'm not sure I like these
[21933.36s -> 21935.36s]  these might be too slow in a game that's this fast
[21935.36s -> 21937.98s]  it's kind of hard to use them
[21937.98s -> 21947.63s]  where's my AR?
[21947.63s -> 21950.83s]  yeah
[21950.83s -> 21961.97s]  I couldn't even do it
[21961.97s -> 21966.62s]  just tried to do it you heard it
[21966.62s -> 21968.62s]  voice just got cracked right there
[21968.62s -> 21986.86s]  oh Jeremy
[21986.86s -> 21988.86s]  you got it
[21988.86s -> 21992.58s]  you got the arm on purpose
[21992.58s -> 22002.88s]  I tried
[22002.88s -> 22004.88s]  actually here's why those things are not terrible
[22004.88s -> 22006.88s]  because they can hit more than one person at a time
[22006.88s -> 22013.14s]  nice work Jeremy
[22013.14s -> 22015.76s]  you did a great job
[22015.76s -> 22040.21s]  I'm doing fine it's okay
[22040.21s -> 22042.21s]  Jeremy makes less jokes and he enjoys a game
[22042.21s -> 22044.51s]  um
[22044.51s -> 22046.51s]  I don't know if
[22046.51s -> 22048.51s]  it's just hard to talk and play at the same time
[22048.51s -> 22051.46s]  you know what I mean?
[22051.46s -> 22054.40s]  when there's a bunch of enemies on screen
[22054.40s -> 22056.40s]  it's like
[22058.40s -> 22060.40s]  I can't be like
[22060.40s -> 22062.40s]  I was at the grocery store yesterday
[22062.40s -> 22064.40s]  let me tell you something
[22064.40s -> 22073.04s]  hates game? what?
[22073.04s -> 22075.04s]  when did you hear that?
[22075.04s -> 22077.04s]  when did I say hate game?
[22077.04s -> 22079.47s]  I would not be streaming
[22079.47s -> 22081.47s]  I would not be playing this game for more than 6 hours
[22081.47s -> 22083.47s]  if I hated the game
[22083.47s -> 22085.65s]  what?
[22085.65s -> 22088.40s]  no
[22088.40s -> 22090.40s]  I think it's fun
[22090.40s -> 22093.66s]  I wouldn't be playing it if I didn't think that
[22093.66s -> 22095.66s]  and by the way let me tell you something
[22095.66s -> 22097.66s]  I went to see infinity war for like the 34th time
[22097.66s -> 22099.66s]  I saw infinity war
[22099.66s -> 22101.66s]  for every single year that I've been live
[22101.66s -> 22103.66s]  because I had to
[22103.66s -> 22105.66s]  and I'm in line
[22105.66s -> 22107.66s]  and let me tell you something
[22107.66s -> 22109.66s]  popcorn? fucking expensive
[22109.66s -> 22111.66s]  it's like the airlines
[22111.66s -> 22113.66s]  you know what I mean? when you go to the movie theater
[22113.66s -> 22115.66s]  essentially you're going to an entertainment airline
[22115.66s -> 22123.60s]  you know what I mean?
[22123.60s -> 22126.67s]  they charge so much but here's the difference
[22126.67s -> 22131.09s]  alright I gotta stop that
[22131.09s -> 22133.09s]  somebody just said shut up
[22133.09s -> 22135.46s]  you see? you know what I mean?
[22135.46s -> 22137.46s]  you know what I mean? you know what I mean?
[22137.46s -> 22142.19s]  one guy said that
[22142.19s -> 22144.19s]  yeah but there's still one guy that's angry
[22144.19s -> 22146.19s]  that I just did that
[22146.19s -> 22148.19s]  activate the vac system
[22148.19s -> 22165.09s]  every time I activate this I fall down
[22165.09s -> 22170.53s]  you guys are going to have to have like a vote
[22170.53s -> 22172.53s]  amongst yourselves here
[22172.53s -> 22176.43s]  Jerma talk, Jerma don't talk
[22176.43s -> 22178.43s]  hey you shut up, be quiet
[22178.43s -> 22180.43s]  why aren't you talking? we're the jokes
[22180.43s -> 22182.80s]  pay attention
[22182.80s -> 22185.36s]  do we have like a poll in chat here?
[22185.36s -> 22196.37s]  I hate you guys so much
[22196.37s -> 22198.93s]  no no no
[22198.93s -> 22202.13s]  I'm talking about
[22202.13s -> 22204.13s]  ow my stomach
[22204.13s -> 22206.37s]  I'm talking about
[22206.37s -> 22208.37s]  these enemies
[22208.37s -> 22210.61s]  ow I'm talking about the
[22210.61s -> 22212.61s]  I just like hurt myself
[22212.61s -> 22214.61s]  I'm talking about the enemies, the vultures
[22214.61s -> 22222.99s]  I'm not talking about
[22222.99s -> 22232.51s]  you guys
[22232.51s -> 22235.01s]  no, the stupid fucking
[22235.01s -> 22237.01s]  vulture guy, I hate them
[22237.01s -> 22241.94s]  he called us vultures
[22241.94s -> 22243.94s]  oh
[22243.94s -> 22246.88s]  oh my
[22246.88s -> 22248.88s]  let me see that clip
[22248.88s -> 22250.88s]  I want to hear how fucking bad that was
[22250.88s -> 22252.88s]  that probably sounded
[22252.88s -> 22255.12s]  so bad
[22255.12s -> 22259.09s]  ugh
[22259.09s -> 22263.10s]  oh no
[22263.10s -> 22267.65s]  they gotta get the whole thing there
[22267.65s -> 22272.06s]  ugh
[22272.06s -> 22274.06s]  I'm losing viewers now
[22274.06s -> 22278.16s]  that's not what I meant, y'all know it, come on
[22278.16s -> 22286.91s]  holy shit that was bad
[22286.91s -> 22288.91s]  wait are people actually leaving
[22288.91s -> 22290.91s]  because they thought that's what I was saying
[22290.91s -> 22304.22s]  it was actually
[22304.22s -> 22331.17s]  somewhere there's somebody that really thought
[22331.17s -> 22333.17s]  because I did just say
[22333.17s -> 22335.17s]  something about chat and stuff
[22335.17s -> 22337.17s]  what do you want me to do
[22337.17s -> 22339.17s]  ugh that came out so bad
[22339.17s -> 22341.60s]  all the fucking vultures
[22341.60s -> 22350.56s]  you got a dragon ball
[22350.56s -> 22362.53s]  in your face
[22362.53s -> 22364.53s]  alright now don't fuck this up
[22364.53s -> 22366.53s]  it's gonna go up
[22366.53s -> 22368.53s]  and do it again
[22368.53s -> 22374.34s]  we need an apology statement
[22374.34s -> 22377.47s]  well I'm sorry that you may have
[22377.47s -> 22379.47s]  thought that's what I said
[22379.47s -> 22390.54s]  that's not what I said
[22390.54s -> 22395.34s]  wait cut car in half, doesn't make you happy right?
[22399.36s -> 22401.36s]  can't even cut the car in half
[22401.36s -> 22404.30s]  how am I supposed to make everybody happy
[22404.30s -> 22406.30s]  nice non apology
[22410.30s -> 22412.30s]  that's making me laugh
[22417.17s -> 22419.17s]  ugh
[22419.17s -> 22429.09s]  that's what I said I hated these enemies
[22429.09s -> 22437.52s]  look at me now
[22437.52s -> 22439.52s]  I've come to have a lot of perspective
[22439.52s -> 22445.92s]  you know what I mean
[22445.92s -> 22459.42s]  I got two here
[22459.42s -> 22461.42s]  the whole point of the segment is to show how much better you are now
[22461.42s -> 22464.50s]  I mean I feel like I
[22464.50s -> 22468.02s]  have been brewing a lot
[22468.02s -> 22470.02s]  the whole point right?
[22470.02s -> 22472.02s]  you can't be a top number one
[22472.02s -> 22474.02s]  video game player
[22474.02s -> 22476.02s]  you gotta get the muscle
[22476.02s -> 22478.02s]  memory you gotta fucking drink some water
[22478.02s -> 22480.02s]  you gotta accidentally press L2
[22480.02s -> 22482.02s]  twice by the way
[22482.02s -> 22493.54s]  twice
[22493.54s -> 22500.83s]  who's still around?
[22500.83s -> 22503.46s]  who's this?
[22503.46s -> 22505.82s]  really?
[22505.82s -> 22507.82s]  well now I'm gonna fucking mutilate him
[22507.82s -> 22514.42s]  that clip is gonna haunt me
[22514.42s -> 22516.42s]  for the next six years
[22516.42s -> 22520.38s]  people are gonna take the whole clip and be like
[22520.38s -> 22522.38s]  look what he said, can you believe this shit?
[22547.50s -> 22557.02s]  fuck
[22557.02s -> 22559.02s]  watch the actual clip
[22559.02s -> 22561.02s]  does somebody have a full one?
[22561.02s -> 22572.93s]  nice chapter okay?
[22572.93s -> 22575.23s]  the truth comes out
[22575.23s -> 22577.23s]  is this the right one?
[22577.23s -> 22580.30s]  pull?
[22580.30s -> 22582.30s]  I gotta hear how bad this is

[22615.58s -> 22618.32s]  it's too late
[22618.32s -> 22620.32s]  it's really so bad
[22629.89s -> 22631.89s]  there it is
[22631.89s -> 22633.89s]  the career is over
[22633.89s -> 22637.98s]  I wanna use these
[22637.98s -> 22643.30s]  I feel like I could use these if I start to actually play
[22643.30s -> 22646.50s]  I want the skill with them too
[22646.50s -> 22648.50s]  where's the skill?
[22648.50s -> 22666.48s]  turbulence, right here
[22666.48s -> 22668.48s]  I guess you can follow up the slash with a powerful downward strike
[22668.48s -> 22673.02s]  I'll get it
[22673.02s -> 22675.02s]  who is another one?
[22675.02s -> 22677.02s]  down burst

[22690.78s -> 22694.43s]  points here
[22694.43s -> 22698.72s]  yeah
[22698.72s -> 22700.72s]  you can charge the second hit as well, that's pretty cool
[22700.72s -> 22705.78s]  I don't have enough for the mariachi
[22705.78s -> 22730.99s]  the devil
[22730.99s -> 22732.99s]  everything okay on your side?
[22732.99s -> 22734.99s]  I am out of colorado airspace
[22734.99s -> 22736.99s]  and nothing on the radar
[22736.99s -> 22738.99s]  that guy's face seriously looks like the scream mask
[22738.99s -> 22740.99s]  I'm almost there
[22740.99s -> 22745.73s]  does he get a full letagrade?
[22745.73s -> 22763.58s]  do I get to ride the motorcycle?

[22780.38s -> 22782.38s]  having a little heart to heart
[22782.38s -> 22784.38s]  I just analyzed his words and actions
[22784.38s -> 22786.38s]  I am unable to ascertain
[22786.38s -> 22788.38s]  his motivation
[22790.38s -> 22793.26s]  fancy meeting you here
[22793.26s -> 22795.26s]  you knew I'd come
[22795.26s -> 22798.02s]  I suppose I should thank you for not killing
[22798.02s -> 22800.02s]  everyone at the launch site
[22800.02s -> 22803.47s]  hehehehe
[22803.47s -> 22805.47s]  well not if you say it like that
[22805.47s -> 22807.47s]  I just want a mack truck to drive down the road
[22807.47s -> 22809.97s]  you're not very good at your job
[22809.97s -> 22812.27s]  the war
[22812.27s -> 22816.05s]  is the big payoff
[22816.05s -> 22818.05s]  big raises all around
[22818.05s -> 22820.05s]  once world marshal gets all those contracts
[22820.05s -> 22822.35s]  I'm not
[22822.35s -> 22824.35s]  talking about money jack
[22824.35s -> 22827.62s]  I'm talking ideals

[22829.62s -> 22832.82s]  forget it
[22832.82s -> 22834.82s]  we've both heard enough speeches about higher causes
[22834.82s -> 22837.76s]  by now
[22837.76s -> 22839.76s]  history will decide who's right
[22842.00s -> 22844.56s]  end of story
[22844.56s -> 22848.72s]  van van van van
[22848.72s -> 22850.72s]  van van

[22866.72s -> 22869.79s]  I don't care who thinks I'm right
[22869.79s -> 22871.79s]  I've got cause enough for killing you

[23482.86s -> 23490.83s]  streamer to defeat Sam I highly doubt that any cyborg enhancements was this
[23491.39s -> 23501.15s]  necessary evidence inconclusive I guess even a eyes don't know everything it is
[23501.15s -> 23508.47s]  likely no single correct answer exists additionally human conflict stems from
[23508.47s -> 23514.55s]  opposing ideals and societal norms I was not programmed with these
[23514.55s -> 23525.06s]  guidelines you're better off figuring those out for yourself new weapon ID

[24138.50s -> 24172.80s]  part of the line of the line that hurt give me some of that pizza man I need
[24172.80s -> 24208.66s]  of brainpower no why why do you say that it's taking over the whole internet
[24208.66s -> 24219.55s]  doesn't matter well shit from fucking ten years ago doesn't matter nothing you
[24219.55s -> 24226.32s]  sure we got the right only base big enough with security contracted out to
[24226.88s -> 24239.11s]  all right I'm headed in goodness gracious put the mariachi nice to play that it's
[24239.11s -> 24280.25s]  too late to put that on fine what a great end of the video game level and
[24280.25s -> 24300.76s]  cutscene wait to see what the thumbnail for this video is gonna be eliminate
[24300.76s -> 24325.87s]  all enemies a Lolli Lolli lemonade all enemies
[24333.31s -> 24356.42s]  holy shit he just gave up after buying the mariachi that's not true
[24356.42s -> 24374.59s]  it is I believe I have all I need for a little surprise
[24374.59s -> 24391.46s]  they used to like healthy room one hit you see that yeah their exit codes show
[24391.46s -> 24396.46s]  up as unaffiliated wait Marshall has the security contract for the space why
[24396.46s -> 24399.54s]  would they have their side work set to the same illegal exit code as
[24399.54s -> 24405.06s]  Desperado it's evidence against them no it's their alibi they're making it
[24405.06s -> 24408.90s]  look like Desperado hacked their soldiers on site because everyone knows
[24408.90s -> 24417.14s]  Desperado has a contract with the Pakistani rebels I'm too tired to mute
[24417.14s -> 24421.22s]  the game audio and voice act up this nice big foreign threat all cooked up
[24421.22s -> 24424.94s]  and ready to serve the media and the public won't be able to resist
[24424.94s -> 24429.46s]  remember WMDs in Iraq we're at the end of the game no I'm not gonna do
[24429.50s -> 24435.62s]  that what about any humans on the base Marshal only handled security dead most
[24435.62s -> 24440.86s]  likely or brain-jacked if they needed them to keep up appearances they'd
[24440.86s -> 24443.82s]  never publicize what airport the president was flying into not in this
[24443.82s -> 24448.26s]  region and almost no one would have access to an outside line for security
[24448.26s -> 24452.14s]  reasons it wouldn't be difficult to keep things hush hush at least
[24453.14s -> 24458.32s]  I'm heading for the control tower if I can destroy the antenna array the US
[24458.32s -> 24464.90s]  military will know something's wrong good idea be careful just blue the winds
[24464.90s -> 24471.52s]  of destruction away fly backwards
[24471.52s -> 24499.43s]  didn't break it today but I'm sure I do not isn't that funny that nice again
[24499.43s -> 24505.40s]  these idiots with the rocket launchers where are you even aiming that why he
[24505.40s -> 24512.84s]  predicted where I was going to go nice really okay I'm just I can't
[24512.84s -> 24522.66s]  believe it I'm shocked at a point where it's I'm just could you stop doing this
[24522.66s -> 24559.60s]  maybe predict that I might just restart this instead of a shoot of rocket
[24559.60s -> 24569.36s]  proud now I gotta restart the run yeah just turn the whole game I gotta
[24569.36s -> 24588.37s]  restart the whole game that runs over here guys I'm sorry much unnecessary I'm
[24588.49s -> 24600.50s]  like making shitty noises he's just like a floating piece of hamburger meat it's
[24600.50s -> 24630.86s]  hard to hit I need health seriously I have no healing seriously what am I
[24630.86s -> 24636.03s]  supposed to do what am I supposed to do I don't know man like it seems like
[24636.03s -> 24644.72s]  it's not like is it impossible I don't know what to do the game actually
[24644.72s -> 24678.56s]  like this I can't understand how did I miss that many times because when I
[24678.56s -> 24681.40s]  would go down and swing it would correct up a little then correct down
[24681.40s -> 24714.54s]  you saw what was happening clip it and watch it another guy with a rocket
[24714.54s -> 24754.75s]  launcher point like making me angry not block a bolt perfect I'm like

[24811.14s -> 24815.26s]  health potion but it doesn't matter it just the thing that refills your health
[24815.26s -> 24840.70s]  got one there get up that where is this thing there whoo okay if I could
[24840.70s -> 24859.51s]  get that endurance book my mouth is just wide open right there good do a

[24863.19s -> 24886.70s]  mean there's like 200 of them so nothing else I have one healing whatever
[24886.70s -> 24894.53s]  it's called let's go this way can I a stealth kill
[24896.73s -> 24917.52s]  what all right all right I need something I want I want you to see
[24917.52s -> 24923.48s]  that because do you see it went right through the middle do it that
[24923.48s -> 24945.80s]  actually went right through the middle it did these backstab ones well
[24945.80s -> 24979.94s]  I'm not like mattering me I'm just it's it's a game that requires a lot
[24979.94s -> 24986.14s]  brain power and sometimes it's hard and and that's okay because it's a fun
[24986.18s -> 24989.14s]  game and I'm really enjoying it I think it's I think this is a swell video game
[24989.14s -> 24994.84s]  how much is this game oh fuck no for real actually no no joking around this
[24994.84s -> 24998.56s]  actually is like four dollars or something isn't it right now it's not
[24998.56s -> 25001.42s]  even like five bucks I think right now yeah I'm sorry seven dollars and
[25001.42s -> 25008.76s]  fifty cents it's currently part of the sale so you like what you see what
[25008.76s -> 25027.88s]  all means download it games almost five years old the sale for the game
[25027.92s -> 25033.24s]  ends in three minutes really
[25070.20s -> 25074.52s]  there's nobody even talking on the screen it's just rocks and explosions I
[25074.52s -> 25114.88s]  can talk during this little tiny guy is gonna get out
[25121.16s -> 25130.64s]  as usual I'm strong impressive little toy you've got there but your plan ends
[25130.64s -> 25132.64s]  here
[25133.96s -> 25141.42s]  idiot you're not ending our plan you're expanding it check the internet
[25141.42s -> 25149.85s]  lately right check the air force one is turning back to the state what how
[25149.85s -> 25153.61s]  they know someone posted photos of what's happening on the base the
[25153.61s -> 25157.73s]  whole world is up in arms show
[25160.43s -> 25173.62s]  no those tabs the story leaked early then Marshall's plan is ruined the hell
[25173.62s -> 25179.02s]  it is look what they're saying the story just went live and already they're
[25179.02s -> 25192.40s]  calling for blood but the president was saved and yet American blood was
[25193.40s -> 25199.28s]  by Americans he's hot a few dozen soldiers is tragic but nothing to start
[25199.28s -> 25206.04s]  a major war over that's just a spark son the excuse we've been waiting for
[25206.04s -> 25211.88s]  America's wanted this war for years the Patriots they knew war was good
[25211.88s -> 25217.00s]  for the economy four years later their legacy lingers on the memes they
[25217.60s -> 25224.04s]  left us their great is a shot nationalism unilateralism materialism
[25224.04s -> 25228.88s]  welcome maxims for those with no faith without guiding principles of
[25228.88s -> 25234.20s]  their own give yourself up to the whole no need to better yourself you're
[25234.20s -> 25240.20s]  American your number one then the only value left is dollar value the
[25240.20s -> 25245.76s]  economy so we'll do whatever it takes to keep it humming along even war
[25246.08s -> 25251.96s]  especially war bullshit the Patriots planted the seed we don't need them
[25251.96s -> 25257.44s]  around to filter and foster their memes any longer we're spreading them just
[25257.44s -> 25263.53s]  find ourselves every American man woman and child
[25265.17s -> 25271.16s]  I'm surprised that's something to jumpstart the economy out of this
[25271.72s -> 25279.84s]  this recession has been stuck in since the fall of SOP and the military costs
[25279.84s -> 25284.16s]  wasting billions is going to help the economy
[25284.16s -> 25292.15s]  emcees arms manufacturers job creators Jack all those workers I just imagine

[26487.04s -> 26497.04s]  are you talking about when did this game come out what I'm using war as a
[26497.04s -> 26503.56s]  business to get elected so I can end
[26506.02s -> 26520.44s]  in mine people will die and kill not for money not for oil not for what
[26520.44s -> 26526.56s]  they're told is right every man will be free to fight his own wars
[26526.56s -> 26567.02s]  mr. really liked this game well I don't write my own speeches should try
[26567.02s -> 26571.34s]  fighting for what you believe in sometime Jack it's a Reagan club or a
[26571.34s -> 26585.04s]  nation or for anyone else maybe I was wrong about you am I finally
[26585.04s -> 26600.20s]  getting through with this world of pointless wars dusting them off

[26635.67s -> 26640.34s]  worst way you could possibly get up and look behind you
[26640.34s -> 26646.44s]  can't fret over every day not when you're purging right what do you know
[26646.44s -> 26652.72s]  about weak you weren't born poor you've never been hungry
[26652.72s -> 26658.40s]  fight and steal and kill justice survive but you did survive
[26658.40s -> 26663.00s]  sheer force of will following your own set of rules with your own two
[26663.00s -> 26670.96s]  hands you took back your life and now take yours the real boss fight no
[26670.96s -> 26682.20s]  weapons just this fight right apparently I guess I don't know I just

[26785.57s -> 26790.43s]  there more of this shit I can't handle this anymore
[26790.43s -> 26804.64s]  nanomachines son they harmed in response to physical trauma can't hurt

[26816.84s -> 26822.24s]  this should be broken but off your head what an oversight by the deaf
[26822.80s -> 26856.54s]  very mean
[26865.54s -> 26885.15s]  all right I think we're about done here right
[26891.91s -> 26897.72s]  working towards this and on the last day Lonnie has me doubting the whole
[26897.72s -> 26904.91s]  thing we'll leave it up to fate then shall we will see a duel to the death
[26905.51s -> 26914.84s]  the best man win Sam I cut him down and that's that back to a regularly
[26914.84s -> 26923.73s]  scheduled international now I can hurt him but if he beeps me if I die here
[26923.73s -> 26928.08s]  the lock on my blade will disable after a couple hours

[26968.56s -> 26975.64s]  ensure all data acquired is preserved and pass along to expire here would
[26975.64s -> 26981.52s]  violate that directive that's a good boy
[26981.72s -> 26989.52s]  however right came to my aid I have learned from him when Samuel fell data
[26989.52s -> 26996.08s]  analysis was inconclusive but that has changed I have established new
[26996.08s -> 27002.68s]  parameters now created my only directives like a 30-minute ending
[27002.68s -> 27005.36s]  sequence here

[27035.28s -> 27048.50s]  anger not used for vengeance but my favorite flavor strawberry and besides
[27049.06s -> 27058.59s]  this isn't my soul

[28033.52s -> 28042.04s]  funny this stream is seven hours and 48 minutes long the game was seven dollars
[28042.04s -> 28055.92s]  and fifty cents didn't that the dollar a minute I know that's that
[28055.92s -> 28061.84s]  that's a cent that's us wait is that a cent every that's a cent per
[28061.84s -> 28075.00s]  minute a dollar a minute would know that's not that would be 700 let me
[28075.20s -> 28083.08s]  seven it's too late it's too I'm too frustrated it's a dollar every one point
[28083.08s -> 28085.52s]  well you know what I'm saying it's a seven dollar and fifty cent game is
[28085.52s -> 28089.56s]  seven hours and fifty cents one cent per hour whatever the fuck it is I
[28089.56s -> 28103.08s]  don't even know thanks for watching seven hours and fifty cents a dollar
[28103.08s -> 28110.60s]  an hour point eight whatever it is I was a post credit scene apparently
[28110.60s -> 28118.50s]  we're gonna stay but also I want to the reason why we go I had an
[28118.54s -> 28124.08s]  opportunity to to leave and try do it again tomorrow or something but I want
[28124.08s -> 28126.24s]  to get the whole thing done tonight because I want to do a longer stream
[28126.24s -> 28134.03s]  tonight because I have some plans over the next couple days and I'm not gonna
[28134.03s -> 28141.62s]  be around for the next two days to stream so you will see me again I
[28141.62s -> 28144.86s]  know I've been going it's really erratic the last week with the whole
[28144.86s -> 28148.30s]  New Year's Eve thing and pushing back streams and the Christmas Eve
[28148.30s -> 28153.66s]  thing but really wanted to do at least like an eight to nine plus hour stream
[28153.66s -> 28160.30s]  tonight so what's gonna happen is today I know what technically today for a lot
[28160.30s -> 28167.80s]  of you guys what's today Thursday what is today today's technically Wednesday yes

[28177.06s -> 28184.28s]  doing things that I was planning on doing so we'll do the whole weekend
[28184.28s -> 28187.84s]  Saturday Sunday and then Monday there's a lot of shit to do I was
[28187.84s -> 28190.12s]  thinking about booting up the PlayStation 2 and doing Simpsons hit
[28190.12s -> 28195.87s]  and run for the weekend maybe and if not that then there's also best for
[28195.87s -> 28200.51s]  cleanup detail there's also a more kenshi there's a I plan on going three
[28200.51s -> 28211.08s]  or four straight days in a row so final thoughts that if you don't own
[28211.08s -> 28218.32s]  this game it sure is a lot of fun for seven dollars great Canadian Fuck
[28218.32s -> 28221.80s]  Club just gave up ten minute itself ten more to add to the list of the
[28221.80s -> 28234.08s]  hundreds the actual hundreds of community subs that you have given do a
[28234.08s -> 28240.75s]  fortnight dance what are you talking about have ever played monster hunter
[28240.75s -> 28244.63s]  yeah actually I played a lot of monster hunter world streamed it a few
[28244.63s -> 28251.13s]  times played pretty much to the end of the game not on stream but Darth
[28251.13s -> 28266.10s]  Vader what oh no I played one of the old ones on stream too you said

[28288.88s -> 28294.65s]  want to see if there's something at the end but thank you so much double D
[28294.65s -> 28302.82s]  five community subs don't run away from this all right fine really I mean
[28302.82s -> 28305.74s]  I've got I don't know what which one is which but I'm gonna crash the
[28305.74s -> 28334.87s]  game okay so I'm just gonna say this is one is it hairline turn off the
[28334.87s -> 28359.80s]  hairline worst hair this is this looks good that's the baby little kid
[28359.80s -> 28371.94s]  dance all right here we go here is the end of the stream voice cutscene
[28371.94s -> 28400.72s]  acknowledge the DLC okay how much does the DLC add thank you that's a
[28400.72s -> 28412.42s]  couple hours two stories and about Sam that's cool it's great so three
[28412.42s -> 28422.01s]  hours super fun all story related all right yeah that's kind of a weird
[28422.01s -> 28426.40s]  like that's gonna have to be a scenario where because if it's like a
[28426.44s -> 28430.72s]  three-hour experience that's that's not enough to do for a whole stream so that
[28430.72s -> 28433.36s]  have to be a day where there's something to do for two or three hours
[28433.36s -> 28438.68s]  and then that we kind of need two three to four hour experiences back to
[28438.68s -> 28445.32s]  back you know I mean I keep saying it you know you know me New Year's
[28445.32s -> 28452.67s]  resolution okay 2020 I'm gonna stop saying we go oh good good there are

[28462.36s -> 28468.38s]  lot of money not to mention killing their funding literally the
[28468.38s -> 28473.54s]  breathtaking program is finished but the larger company is not I'm afraid
[28473.54s -> 28479.54s]  that someone will buy them PMC's are in demand once again
[28479.54s -> 28490.79s]  fighting for reasons they don't know microcomputers big pardon no nothing so

[29408.29s -> 29411.49s]  wasn't able to watch the stream live but I watched the VOD last night it
[29411.49s -> 29414.77s]  was a great stream but when I went to bed I had a horrific nightmare when my
[29414.77s -> 29419.49s]  hair was replaced with your hair it was very messy and I couldn't get it
[29419.49s -> 29421.97s]  to look good so I locked myself in the bathroom and freaked out while

[29453.36s -> 29456.12s]  one dollar local streamer isn't sure if there is stealth in a Metal
[29456.12s -> 29460.88s]  Gear game but there is no there is here's how you tell if there's
[29460.88s -> 29465.56s]  stealth in a video game there was no stealth in that game I'm sorry there
[29465.56s -> 29471.22s]  wasn't where was the crouch button if a game has stealth it has a crouch or a
[29471.22s -> 29481.05s]  duck and walk slow button there was no stealth in that game there was walk
[29481.05s -> 29490.15s]  that's not stealth it's called using the box no no no no no no I'm sorry
[29490.15s -> 29500.95s]  that doesn't count the box does not count as a crouch how doesn't that
[29500.95s -> 29510.90s]  count because that's you're putting yourself into a box there is no push
[29510.90s -> 29516.92s]  in l3 and you go down and you're creeping around it's an item that's an
[29516.92s -> 29521.02s]  emote that's an emote dance from fortnight is what that was in this
[29521.02s -> 29533.04s]  game that's how it wasn't the other Metal Gears no wasn't and the other
[29533.04s -> 29539.71s]  Middle Gears you could go up against the wall and go well where was my
[29539.71s -> 29572.94s]  whistle where's my knock you crouch down in the box did you pay it hey

[29720.74s -> 29729.86s]  DLCs it just is it a really a scenario where Konami just doesn't get
[29729.86s -> 29745.71s]  it and it just makes slot machines you guys know that right yeah yes we
[29745.71s -> 29756.10s]  know it sucks they have a lot of great franchises the developer of the

[29891.04s -> 29900.53s]  dollars a hundred dollars that's a big gesture to that person it is the fact
[29900.53s -> 29907.85s]  that you would even think about doing that in the first place I don't collect

[30042.74s -> 30045.90s]  thought of a very uncomfortable event imagine biting the side of your fork
[30045.90s -> 30052.91s]  and expecting food but just tasting metal and pain that's not that's not
[30052.91s -> 30063.89s]  a good thing to think about it's like chewing on tinfoil ah chewing on tinfoil

[30167.40s -> 30173.08s]  information that you guys need to know I love that character I love that
[30173.08s -> 30189.23s]  character it's like my favorite character I'm like actually it makes
[30189.23s -> 30195.62s]  me laugh that so many people like fuck this guy you know how much fun I had on
[30195.62s -> 30204.29s]  that first stream hiring him having him come and do that that was just fun I
[30204.29s -> 30216.38s]  did it was fun probably gonna fucking do it again thank you time for slime
[30216.38s -> 30223.08s]  for that touching video the five dollar mask you bought at a pharmacy for
[30223.08s -> 30231.49s]  Halloween that mask was not five dollars at a few zeros no that means
[30231.49s -> 30242.67s]  it's five thousand that mask was not five thousand dollars that mask was five
[30242.67s -> 30251.09s]  grand okay gonna get my money's worth out of that character hey thanks
[30251.09s -> 30255.83s]  peaceful Haley for the one dollar hey Jeremy just wanted to know how you
[30255.83s -> 30258.31s]  were doing and also just wanted to let you know how amazing your
[30258.31s -> 30262.67s]  community is and the friends I've made a here on discord on here and on
[30262.67s -> 30266.91s]  discord and the people who come over and watch my stream feels good when I
[30266.91s -> 30270.03s]  can entertain others and that's all thanks to you or else I wouldn't have
[30270.03s -> 30273.31s]  known what to do with myself so thank you Jeremy you're awesome
[30273.31s -> 30283.35s]  yeah I fought for a long time to even have that discord because I wasn't sure
[30283.35s -> 30286.43s]  if it was something I wanted to do do I want to have a discord but
[30286.43s -> 30290.07s]  people do discords I do think the paid discord no no why would I do
[30290.07s -> 30294.47s]  that like sub rooms channel how do I even manage this like I didn't know if
[30294.47s -> 30300.16s]  it was something I was gonna do because that it's hard to do that it's
[30300.16s -> 30302.80s]  hard I mean as much as it's easy to be like I have a discord and go
[30302.80s -> 30307.77s]  there and but I whatever managing something like that with thousands of
[30307.77s -> 30313.71s]  people is actually hard to do so you can thank the mods for being around all
[30313.71s -> 30318.15s]  the time to take care of that and to make it so much easier to have that
[30318.15s -> 30324.33s]  because I'll be very frank with you if the mods in this community were not
[30324.33s -> 30329.94s]  on top of their game every day that discord does not exist I wouldn't be
[30329.94s -> 30335.26s]  able to have it I've tried before to have communities I've had groups
[30335.26s -> 30338.98s]  I've had oh I'm just gonna set up this thing and maybe I can like a steam
[30338.98s -> 30353.77s]  group and shit and I never can manage it so without them there is no discord
[30353.77s -> 30358.72s]  and I'm really glad that it can exist because messages like this proved
[30358.72s -> 30369.75s]  that it's worth having for sure no right music's not playing but thank
[30369.75s -> 30381.95s]  you peaceful Haley appreciate it uh yakko boo thank you for the $1 no
[30381.95s -> 30386.97s]  message thank you thank you yakko Alec thanks for the two bucks so when
[30386.97s -> 30390.85s]  are you gonna play ocarina of time I'm probably not gonna play ocarina of time
[30390.85s -> 30400.63s]  on stream probably not if I was to do a Zelda game on stream it would probably
[30400.63s -> 30411.10s]  be breath of the wild but even that's kind of a long shot at this point so
[30411.10s -> 30414.88s]  if I was to play a Zelda game that would be the one that would be played
[30414.88s -> 30424.18s]  but why oh cuz it's a pretty huge time commitment I played a lot of red
[30424.18s -> 30430.06s]  dead and I streamed a lot of red dead and isn't breath of the wild a
[30430.26s -> 30441.13s]  huge game this stream this community I feel like and I'm like this too I don't
[30441.13s -> 30444.61s]  really like to have oh yeah breath of the wild breath of the wild breath of
[30444.61s -> 30448.86s]  the wild because when I get into a game I want to play it but I don't
[30448.86s -> 30454.17s]  really like streaming a game more than four or five six times in a row
[30454.17s -> 30458.92s]  and then if I leave it I'll come back to it there's all this shit
[30458.92s -> 30463.24s]  that's going on more ideas and more games and I never usually go back to
[30463.24s -> 30473.42s]  it yeah I would say play breath of the
[30473.42s -> 30477.40s]  wild on your own maybe stream it once or twice that's typically how it goes yeah
[30477.40s -> 30482.32s]  I'll play a game that's like breath of the wild like a red dead like there's a
[30482.32s -> 30487.39s]  lot of other ones that have been in that similar realm play it on stream
[30487.39s -> 30491.63s]  few times maybe three or four times and then all right that was cool I'm
[30491.63s -> 30503.07s]  gonna finish it on my own so that's definitely possible please go back to
[30503.07s -> 30509.10s]  red dead though I beat the game off-stream I completed red dead
[30509.10s -> 30525.26s]  redemption 2 off-stream betrayal it was great did you finish everything I
[30525.26s -> 30535.47s]  finished everything everything I love rockstar games so I did all the story
[30535.47s -> 30539.39s]  and it did all the side stuff I didn't do all the hunting stuff though
[30539.39s -> 30545.81s]  but I did I think pretty much all the dialogue content that's in the game
[30545.81s -> 30554.67s]  to be honest I'm glad you enjoyed it definitely worth keeping some games
[30555.55s -> 30562.06s]  yeah I mean this this could bleed into a conversation about the game that you
[30562.06s -> 30567.85s]  saw tonight it's a different when I play a game
[30567.85s -> 30571.49s]  off-stream it's a lot different you know I'm just kind of sitting there
[30571.49s -> 30577.33s]  and I'm not really talking I'm just enjoying the game and having fun I'm
[30577.33s -> 30581.63s]  not really speaking or anything and it could actually have I have some
[30581.63s -> 30584.59s]  trouble especially the games that require a lot of attention and this
[30584.59s -> 30591.98s]  is because of my uncontrollable ADHD looking at chat and talking and let's
[30591.98s -> 30594.58s]  talk about this thing and this thing and it's it's kind of it's I like
[30594.58s -> 30600.26s]  having you know the off-stream sit there with my mouth open type of
[30600.26s -> 30605.78s]  type of experience and yeah you can't really do that on stream I can't
[30605.78s -> 30617.70s]  really sit here and just like this for like 40 straight minutes that's
[30617.70s -> 30624.12s]  another five community subs from soft 33 thank you soft for the five
[30624.88s -> 30632.39s]  surprised and glad you have time to play games on your own and with how much you
[30632.39s -> 30639.60s]  put into your streams yeah but remember I want I want this I want each stream
[30639.60s -> 30646.62s]  that I do to engage and talk and hang hang out and interact with you guys
[30646.62s -> 30652.00s]  and sometimes it is nice just to turn off my brain and just not just sit
[30652.00s -> 30659.92s]  there and I'll play a game like Red Dead for like six straight hours it's
[30659.92s -> 30671.80s]  just eating fucking chocolate you know I mean but yeah it is but but there's
[30671.80s -> 30674.48s]  another thing though this is why it's it's kind of a double-edged sword
[30674.48s -> 30678.92s]  because if in games a lot of times I'll be playing a game just alone in the
[30678.92s -> 30682.20s]  dark with the headphones on or something and all of a sudden something
[30682.20s -> 30686.28s]  fucking hysterical happens or something awesome happens and I'm
[30686.28s -> 30690.89s]  looking around just like where did you see anybody see that I nobody's in
[30690.89s -> 30695.85s]  the room oh so I was awesome I should have been streaming this what
[30695.85s -> 30708.82s]  you know what I mean it happens a lot I think there's a balance somewhere
[30708.82s -> 30721.76s]  Bixby start game record how many Jax moments happen in private I mean I
[30721.76s -> 30724.56s]  could tell you how many I could say oh it happens all the time you're not
[30724.56s -> 30728.20s]  gonna believe me you know oh yeah you know you should have seen when I
[30728.20s -> 30732.72s]  was playing off stream I didn't saw I did all this cool shit it's like
[30732.72s -> 30751.76s]  okay sure you did but it's all good it's all good but thank you thank
[30751.76s -> 30755.60s]  you Ike turtle for the one dollar a towel I rubbed German nose wipe here's
[30755.60s -> 30769.67s]  a sewer dollar what's a sewer dollar thank you as a right reaction for the
[30769.67s -> 30773.63s]  one dollar chat maybe if you guys stopped spamming 40 things for him to
[30773.63s -> 30777.31s]  do he would actually be able to notice a single thing in the game and maybe
[30777.31s -> 30780.55s]  if you stopped spamming shit then it would actually be a surprise to him
[30780.55s -> 30807.38s]  instead of spoiling it 20 minutes in advance 20 minutes in advance thank
[30807.38s -> 30814.96s]  you as a right reaction it's alright though I mean like yes sometimes I do
[30814.96s -> 30819.02s]  look over it and I see three four different things before what you're
[30819.02s -> 30821.50s]  doing you need to do that you got to do this you have to do this what you
[30821.50s -> 30824.62s]  doing why go that way go the other way that weapon sucks and it's just
[30824.62s -> 30840.16s]  like I don't know what oh but that's just that's just what happens though
[30840.16s -> 30854.07s]  it's it you know it back seating nice not even no it's all right Ken
[30854.07s -> 30858.15s]  and like I get it like I'm not doing something right or if I'm fucking up and
[30858.15s -> 30861.51s]  do something wrong and I'm not learning it yeah probably is frustrating to watch
[30861.51s -> 30865.67s]  but it's also frustrating for me too because I want I want to figure it out
[30865.67s -> 30870.78s]  and I want but I don't want to have to figure it out where it's a
[30870.78s -> 30875.64s]  detriment to the stream you know if I spend 50 minutes trying to figure out
[30875.64s -> 30879.16s]  how to block somebody it's like fucking Jesus Jeremy give me a break
[30879.72s -> 30899.83s]  but the game the gnome porn links got old spoilers or shit though really hope
[30899.83s -> 30904.32s]  people can avoid that stuff I didn't really care I mean the one the only
[30904.32s -> 30909.96s]  thing that I kind of was just like oh okay was when everyone was screaming
[30909.96s -> 30918.07s]  about the cat so I mean that's the real that's the only spoiler I really
[30918.07s -> 30921.31s]  think I received during the stream maybe a couple other things too but I
[30921.31s -> 30927.78s]  don't know it at the end of the day it's just people are just trying to
[30927.78s -> 30951.16s]  have fun ruined that cutscene about memes yeah but it's alright I was not
[30951.16s -> 30956.68s]  I've that was not making me frustrated what was making me frustrated was the
[30956.68s -> 30961.59s]  game you know it's a tough game I don't think it was anything in chat
[30961.59s -> 30968.31s]  that I was like shut up everybody I think it was one time maybe where when
[30968.31s -> 30970.71s]  I was telling what I was told to go in four or five different directions
[30970.71s -> 30981.68s]  you're too forgiving you need to punish your chat more but but but
[30981.68s -> 30987.98s]  punish for what you know if I start punishing for stuff like you suck at the
[30987.98s -> 30992.86s]  game or hey you went the wrong way or spoilers I mean a lot of people would
[30992.86s -> 31001.61s]  be on that list too before am I gonna ban them if I ban somebody every time
[31001.61s -> 31008.69s]  somebody told me that you're doing it wrong I think I think half the chat
[31008.69s -> 31030.40s]  wouldn't exist if you nobody there the mods would even get banned that's
[31030.40s -> 31038.84s]  how you know when it's unnecessarily rude it can be kind of depressing yeah I
[31038.84s -> 31042.00s]  mean I'm not gonna lie I'll be completely open here sometimes I look
[31042.00s -> 31048.67s]  over and it's I read something and it's just like fuck that person's is
[31048.67s -> 31052.15s]  really fucking mad at me right now and somebody's saying something fucking
[31052.15s -> 31056.34s]  mean and shit it's just like god I wish I could I really I don't want you
[31056.34s -> 31068.58s]  to be saying that that doesn't happen that often though I would say
[31068.58s -> 31076.65s]  if I stream this 365 days in a year if I stream a hundred days a year if there's
[31076.65s -> 31082.76s]  like a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty streams a year maybe like
[31082.76s -> 31087.60s]  three or four of those streams I will actually look over and be like kind
[31087.60s -> 31109.79s]  of depressed or annoyed by something doesn't happen that often and ninety
[31109.79s -> 31115.84s]  nine point nine percent of the time it's we're just having fun I've been
[31115.84s -> 31118.88s]  I know I've spent a lot of time on this topic but I think it's worth
[31118.88s -> 31126.98s]  talking about like somebody saying that I suck no no no because I know that
[31126.98s -> 31131.72s]  that's you know I do dumb shit in games all the time that's not what I'm
[31131.72s -> 31134.44s]  talking about I'm talking about like me something really mean that's like a
[31134.44s -> 31138.96s]  full-on like sentence about how something I'm doing is so stupid or
[31138.96s -> 31142.64s]  I'm such a piece of shit or something it's just like fucking hell
[31142.64s -> 31164.62s]  mr. German can you eat anybody who complains about bugleberry gets me
[31164.62s -> 31174.40s]  like that and it's so easy let me tell you that it's so easy it's such
[31174.44s -> 31181.62s]  an easy out to say well fuck the haters fucking haters fuck the haters but that
[31181.62s -> 31186.98s]  that's a person with an opinion and they have it for a reason you know I
[31186.98s -> 31190.34s]  don't I hate being that kind of person that's just like a fuck the
[31190.34s -> 31203.58s]  haters cares yeah fucking hater no I that person has an opinion and what
[31203.58s -> 31220.05s]  am I gonna do yeah but their opinion is wrong no if somebody comes
[31220.05s -> 31223.59s]  in here and doesn't like what I'm doing then that's I'm not gonna be mad at
[31223.59s -> 31231.74s]  that person because they don't like what I'm doing that's it they'll move on
[31231.74s -> 31234.34s]  and that's it I'm not gonna be like oh you didn't like what you see here
[31234.34s -> 31238.34s]  you're a fucking little baby and let me tell you that you're a little
[31238.34s -> 31244.45s]  baby no sorry I didn't think it was fun maybe you'll check back again
[31244.45s -> 31265.06s]  another time but this is a pretty long-winded comment about all this
[31265.06s -> 31287.88s]  it's a cool heart to heart yeah it's sometimes we do these sometimes you
[31287.88s -> 31296.31s]  just gotta talk it's all fun and games but you know we're all people here so
[31296.31s -> 31311.43s]  right after that Roger Cheeto thanks for the $1 you missed the memes stop
[31311.43s -> 31330.60s]  talking during cutscenes dumbass the timing the timing was impeccable but
[31330.60s -> 31342.25s]  thank you for the $1 mostly lost thanks for the $1 because you're
[31342.25s -> 31346.97s]  apparently incapable of processing two things at once here's the memes
[31346.97s -> 31383.26s]  cutscene thanks for the dollar mostly let the roast continue protect him no
[31383.26s -> 31386.94s]  that's funny that's funny I mean if I had looked over and saw that like
[31386.94s -> 31389.82s]  four hours ago because I was already like the game was like give I was
[31389.82s -> 31393.46s]  getting kind of mentally fatigued if I looked over and saw that I would
[31393.46s -> 31402.94s]  have been like okay fine fine no it's all good thanks for the dollar you guys
[31402.94s -> 31417.50s]  thank you for speaking a dollar thank you for real though for the $1 watch
[31417.50s -> 31422.09s]  this no this is not something that will get you in trouble I love the
[31422.09s -> 31428.84s]  the context has to be there
[31461.86s -> 31472.60s]  he's just like puking thank you it's not gonna get you in trouble that it's not
[31472.60s -> 31487.25s]  thank you thank you ushi corn for the $1 it's gonna be the last season of
[31487.25s -> 31492.76s]  Eric Andre is it really well I guess maybe he's been doing other shit
[31492.76s -> 31497.71s]  though he's been on other TV shows that aren't the Eric Andre show so
[31497.71s -> 31508.75s]  he's probably he's branching out a lot but thank you ushi corn thank
[31508.75s -> 31515.82s]  you thank you kill Ganon for the dollar 15 I got fired today I'm sorry but I
[31515.82s -> 31519.62s]  decided to use this time to pursue something more creative I just wanted to
[31519.62s -> 31522.26s]  ask when you started making videos that it terrified you that everyone
[31522.26s -> 31536.57s]  would hate what you'd made no because I wasn't making videos I wasn't making
[31536.57s -> 31545.38s]  videos I don't think it's this kind of hard to describe and explain but
[31545.38s -> 31550.48s]  I wasn't I wasn't making videos to try to get like an audience I was kind of
[31550.48s -> 31555.13s]  just doing them it was a way for me to pass my time and I thought they were
[31555.13s -> 31560.37s]  fun and I wasn't really in the back of my mind of oh somebody's gonna hate
[31560.37s -> 31570.04s]  this I was just kind of doing it it really didn't it took probably like
[31570.04s -> 31577.58s]  20 or 30 videos remember I'd had no expectations at all zero absolute zero
[31577.58s -> 31583.53s]  if I got 20 viewers it was like oh that whoa okay who that where they
[31583.53s -> 31596.36s]  from well this is cool so when your intentions are not to I guess when your
[31596.36s -> 31602.94s]  intentions aren't to necessarily have an audience you really don't mind or
[31602.94s -> 31606.42s]  don't necessarily care who comes across it because you're doing it
[31606.42s -> 31611.96s]  because you want to make them not necessarily to have a bunch of
[31611.96s -> 31618.96s]  people and watch my first 10 20 videos it's just me just talking and
[31618.96s -> 31622.88s]  being like fucking weird and saying like strange shit and just doing
[31622.88s -> 31645.57s]  nothing but now I don't think that the words not terrify but I I don't want
[31645.57s -> 31651.48s]  people to hate the things that I make so I try as hard as I'm able to to try
[31651.48s -> 31657.09s]  to do as best as I can because I in my heart and in my brain think that
[31657.09s -> 31662.49s]  the best that I can is hopefully good enough I think everybody thinks that
[31662.49s -> 31677.84s]  everybody just hopes the best that they can is good enough and there are
[31678.68s -> 31684.89s]  a bunch of people here now that I know already kind of get it because they've
[31684.89s -> 31692.64s]  been here for so long it was it's a weird it's a weird thing where made
[31692.64s -> 31698.03s]  videos for years didn't really have that many expectations I wasn't like
[31698.03s -> 31700.87s]  partnered on YouTube for a bit particularly took like a hundred and
[31700.87s -> 31704.11s]  fifty videos I think of more than a like at least fifty to a hundred
[31704.11s -> 31709.39s]  before I had any money at all from YouTube and there's a bunch of
[31709.39s -> 31712.55s]  people here that just a lot of people just kind of get it and they
[31712.55s -> 31718.52s]  think the things are fun and you guys are a part of the joke as much as you
[31718.52s -> 31736.81s]  know for the half the shit that is done on this stream I don't get it did
[31736.81s -> 31739.57s]  you lose the password to your main channel I know it's a meme but I'm
[31739.57s -> 31745.07s]  really curious I've talked about it a bunch of times before but YouTube just
[31745.07s -> 31752.11s]  wasn't it just wasn't doing it for me anymore and I mean that in a
[31752.11s -> 31755.47s]  bunch of different ways it creatively monetarily that's back when
[31755.47s -> 31759.20s]  never YouTube would changed a lot of shit there was a lot of
[31759.20s -> 31761.92s]  subscription shit that they were changing there was a bunch of ad
[31761.92s -> 31767.16s]  revenue stuff that they were getting rid of and it was it was hard to let's
[31767.16s -> 31772.91s]  say if I was gonna spend like a week on a video it just really wasn't
[31772.91s -> 31781.88s]  possible anymore so I didn't lose the password to my main YouTube
[31781.88s -> 31786.70s]  channel I just stopped using it because I started losing interest and
[31786.70s -> 31790.78s]  twitch seemed like the next thing that I wanted to try to do I don't
[31790.78s -> 31796.10s]  know what the next thing will be but I'm not gonna force myself to make
[31796.10s -> 31801.81s]  a video just because I like have to that's not gonna happen if I am not
[31801.81s -> 31806.64s]  wholeheartedly enjoying every everything that I'm doing it'll show
[31806.64s -> 31809.80s]  it'll just be forced and I don't want to force stuff I'd rather have it come
[31809.80s -> 31831.53s]  naturally and have fun natural raw German I've told I've told you guys
[31831.53s -> 31835.05s]  this you know over the last two three years on twitch if what I'm doing is
[31835.05s -> 31839.54s]  not something that I'm having fun doing and enjoying doing and having
[31839.54s -> 31843.34s]  you know more ideas are coming out because remember on YouTube there was a
[31843.34s -> 31846.26s]  lot of things I wanted to try and a lot of things I wanted to do and now
[31846.26s -> 31870.56s]  that's I have to have that same itch on twitch on itch on twitch nice rhyme you
[31870.56s -> 31872.60s]  ever thought about saying that on the main channel innocent people who didn't
[31872.60s -> 31878.56s]  even know you stream just thought you kind of disappeared yeah I think part of
[31878.56s -> 31882.59s]  me in my brain somewhere kind of doesn't want to make that video
[31882.59s -> 31889.96s]  somewhere up in my brain I don't want to tell people it's over here it's
[31889.96s -> 31893.96s]  on twitch and see on twitch this is a weird lock in my brain because
[31893.96s -> 31899.96s]  that's such a huge portion of my life it's like this this door that's still
[31899.96s -> 31906.76s]  up there that I I've got this I know there's a monster in that room but I
[31906.76s -> 31910.99s]  don't know what to do about him he's just in there I can't let him out
[31910.99s -> 31931.07s]  he'll eat me just tell them about the second channel yeah I've thought
[31931.07s -> 31938.88s]  about it but I mean that's another thing too I just don't don't pissing
[31938.88s -> 31943.47s]  people off and making a video on on that main channel saying hey by the
[31943.47s -> 31947.11s]  way I know it's been a couple of years since you last seen me but I'm done
[31947.11s -> 31952.55s]  isn't that like kind of you made you waited two you waited two years to make
[31952.55s -> 31959.13s]  a video saying that I'm done on YouTube hey guys when was the last time
[31959.13s -> 31963.49s]  you heard my voice hey it's a new upload from German on a five here it
[31963.49s -> 31981.10s]  is okay I'm done that's kind of pointless in a way I gotta go I gotta
[31981.10s -> 31992.98s]  get out of here but closing that door is I don't think it's even
[31992.98s -> 31999.76s]  necessarily necessary because I don't know a year or two from now a couple
[31999.76s -> 32002.52s]  of years I don't know who knows maybe I will want to go back to YouTube and
[32002.52s -> 32011.52s]  make more video content actual edited video car I don't know I never had a
[32011.52s -> 32018.82s]  plan I don't have a plan you know like I did this there's no errors the
[32018.82s -> 32030.14s]  plan nope I have plans week to week and month to month if I have
[32030.14s -> 32033.44s]  something that I'd like to do on stream or back when I was making
[32033.44s -> 32039.96s]  YouTube videos I got plans to do content and do things but long term of
[32039.96s -> 32043.86s]  where I want to be and what I want to do not really just wherever the wind
[32043.86s -> 32053.16s]  takes me is what's gonna happen what would you do if streaming was no longer
[32053.16s -> 32063.16s]  profitable um something else you know cuz you have to remember I'm 30 I'm
[32063.16s -> 32075.04s]  turning 34 this year so I mean I wouldn't just disappear but it's at
[32075.04s -> 32078.76s]  some point I gotta do if I wasn't doing streaming or YouTube or
[32078.76s -> 32090.89s]  something I would have to do something else I wouldn't stop streaming but it
[32090.89s -> 32094.81s]  wouldn't be a scenario where it was you know three four days a week or four or
[32094.81s -> 32098.61s]  five whatever days a week for eight nine you know this is nine hour stream
[32098.61s -> 32103.01s]  they'd be shorter it would be maybe once or twice a week when I had time
[32103.01s -> 32119.52s]  if you stop now what would you do huh that's that's a tricky one as a
[32119.52s -> 32135.34s]  really tricky that's a tricky question street magic um probably
[32135.34s -> 32144.01s]  something with the animals I'd go get like a vet tech I'd go back to school
[32144.01s -> 32154.50s]  probably and get a vet like tech degree or something because I I did a
[32154.50s -> 32161.21s]  just about a year stint at an animal shelter and it was great I would do
[32161.21s -> 32175.13s]  that for a job without doubt as a person who runs a rescue and as a vet
[32175.13s -> 32188.15s]  I prove yeah no I'd animals are awesome I would do it you going to
[32188.15s -> 32192.32s]  school to be vet tech right now let us know how it goes and that's probably
[32192.32s -> 32201.61s]  what I would be doing if I wasn't doing this I feel like that maybe I'll still
[32201.61s -> 32204.93s]  do it anyways and I mean I feel I'm probably one of those people that's in
[32204.93s -> 32211.14s]  their 50s and just decides you know what I'm just gonna go work at a zoo I
[32211.14s -> 32215.22s]  don't even care if I'm like the guy I'm if I'm the guy that's like
[32215.22s -> 32220.42s]  cleaning up after the animals and refilling water dishes and shit cool
[32220.42s -> 32241.63s]  that's fine with me pop pug champs did be the guy and from up and sell
[32241.63s -> 32256.27s]  balloons just buy just buy a farm somewhere and produce milk probably why
[32256.27s -> 32271.72s]  not farming is back-breaking work yeah I know I'm just throwing out random
[32271.72s -> 32278.69s]  shit right now when's the next episode of German craft coming out um I'm
[32278.69s -> 32289.92s]  sorry to say but it has been canceled forever but this is a long
[32289.96s -> 32304.99s]  winded very long started with chat and it moved into milking somehow but kill

[32310.98s -> 32317.67s]  today hopefully the decisions that you've made and the things you're gonna

[32354.01s -> 32361.12s]  for a long time a bunch of people have said to play that game on stream
[32361.12s -> 32370.57s]  and I looked into it enough to play it getting close getting close not very

[32381.75s -> 32388.08s]  than just the internet meaning it comes from Richard Dawkins the word meme is a
[32388.08s -> 32396.64s]  shortening modeled on gene of Mimi an imitated thing coined by British
[32396.64s -> 32401.00s]  evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in the selfish gene as a concept for
[32401.00s -> 32412.47s]  discussion of evolutionary principles the memes that's a well thanks for the
[32412.47s -> 32416.43s]  piece of historical scientific data G floater thank you for the five

[32465.40s -> 32471.26s]  this stream labs does this weird thing when you try to copy something it just
[32471.26s -> 32475.04s]  copies the entire page the entire message and it's impossible to deal
[32475.04s -> 32483.63s]  with a virus dog no no no no if you can get me the link again sugar shin I

[32556.42s -> 32558.98s]  hey man hope you enjoyed metal gear rising
[32558.98s -> 32562.38s]  revengeance I got two questions are you gonna play Kenshi Saturday whenever
[32562.38s -> 32565.66s]  you stream and would you consider playing the other metal gear games if
[32565.66s -> 32569.38s]  they get hit by a sale metal gear series is a favorite of mine and I'd
[32569.38s -> 32571.98s]  love to see my favorite streamer play them thanks for the fun man love
[32572.18s -> 32585.01s]  probably not probably not metal gear solid one two I mean three is three is
[32585.01s -> 32588.57s]  pretty interesting three might be worth a stream they all might be worth the
[32588.57s -> 32603.29s]  stream probably not this game was a good one stream one long stream three
[32603.29s -> 32608.33s]  is the best one yeah that's why three might be worth streaming did you

[32755.27s -> 32759.59s]  number one favorite game that I never played the Raiden versus Armstrong
[32759.59s -> 32764.51s]  scene inspired me to do my first and only studio grade dub over at least in
[32764.51s -> 32767.59s]  my opinion so this game is pretty special to me glad you didn't get too
[32767.59s -> 32777.78s]  frustrated with it now go drink some brain fluid you hobbit no I did I
[32777.78s -> 32782.38s]  there was a I got frustrated for about 30 minutes 40 minutes maybe
[32782.38s -> 32788.19s]  during that stream not that much though is it a level it was a very
[32788.19s -> 32802.97s]  containable level thank you for that video hey Garfield the Monday killer
[32802.97s -> 32805.49s]  thanks for the one dollar here's Garfield coming in with some bits I
[32805.49s -> 32808.81s]  didn't know you were streaming German why don't you warn Garfield next time
[32808.81s -> 32813.13s]  you start you want Garfield to miss a stream you want to make Garfield seem
[32813.13s -> 32818.49s]  like he's not committed well gosh god damn it I guess it's time for
[32818.49s -> 32821.97s]  Garfield to make some funny garfed up jokes for you I think this just
[32821.97s -> 32825.25s]  broke the record for the amount of Garfield's I said in a single Gar for
[32825.25s -> 32832.75s]  graph anyway germ who are do you hope to see in smash DLC crash bandicoot hint
[32832.75s -> 32840.32s]  no I mean I would love to see I'm not I'm not gonna know I'm not gonna say
[32840.32s -> 32846.86s]  it everybody thinks I'm gonna say a certain character at this point no Banjo
[32846.86s -> 32850.00s]  Kazooie would be great I'd love to see Banjo return to a
[32850.00s -> 32863.64s]  Nintendo console he was gonna say Gino no I mean no I'd love to see
[32863.64s -> 32872.03s]  Garfield iconic video game cat I'll give you an eye the off-the-wall one
[32872.03s -> 32888.82s]  here Scrooge McDuck get Scrooge McDuck in there he would be perfect you can't
[32888.82s -> 32893.30s]  tell me that Scrooge McDuck would not fit in that especially really
[32893.30s -> 32898.02s]  really popular old retro game that was on the regular Nintendo it was a
[32898.02s -> 32904.23s]  cool awesome game loved by millions his move set it just made itself the
[32904.23s -> 32910.87s]  Pogo the bring bring he's got the his side smash could be the cane swing he's
[32910.87s -> 32930.05s]  got the whole thing the little gems he could throw money out and shit maybe but
[32930.05s -> 32933.41s]  that includes Disney and if Disney's gonna get included then Sora is gonna
[32933.41s -> 32939.06s]  be put in the game it's not gonna be anybody else if there is gonna be a
[32939.06s -> 32946.28s]  big Disney Square or something DLC it's gonna be Sora and I don't want it to
[32946.28s -> 32962.60s]  be but it makes the most sense Kingdom Hearts is right on the horizon square
[32962.60s -> 32966.78s]  doesn't own Sora Disney does that's not like a joint partnership who square
[32966.78s -> 32975.41s]  does not own any of those characters it's all Disney really but there you
[32975.41s -> 32986.30s]  go Scrooge McDuck or banjo cuz we there's your answer thank you no
[32986.30s -> 32997.42s]  thank you no spores bones I'm may I am absolutely destroying your name

[33066.83s -> 33075.41s]  why is it telling me that I'm leaving Facebook yeah I don't know no no links
[33075.41s -> 33090.03s]  oh this dog link oh look at that that is the dog link oh look at what was
[33090.03s -> 33094.53s]  that was that was that a french fry I didn't have these french fries
[33094.53s -> 33115.33s]  anymore since ever scrumptious it's a cute dog you guys don't think I do
[33115.33s -> 33120.62s]  that voice when I anytime I look at my dog my dog will just look at
[33120.62s -> 33124.14s]  me and I'll just start talking as if I'm him talking why do we do that what's
[33124.14s -> 33133.14s]  wrong with human beings every time we see an animal we talk out loud as us
[33133.14s -> 33146.58s]  talking pretending to be the animal talking why I don't do that that's
[33146.58s -> 33157.84s]  just you what I think that's just you it's like a baby voice with
[33157.84s -> 33162.08s]  infants yeah but with the baby voice with infants you're not going like
[33162.08s -> 33166.44s]  this hello yes it's me the baby I'm the baby and yes I'm so cute and I
[33166.44s -> 33170.04s]  just birthed I'm the baby you know you know you're going oh hello baby you're

[33175.66s -> 33179.53s]  crunchy delicious crunchies like that's what you do nobody says I'm the baby
[33179.53s -> 33188.96s]  nobody says I they do it with a dog because we wish that they could talk
[33188.96s -> 33196.57s]  because that's what we hope that they would say that makes sense there's a
[33196.57s -> 33212.56s]  good take on that I'm the baby thank you though thank you Star Wars

[33981.53s -> 33987.54s]  not necessarily I mean I just end up being invited on some things sometimes
[33987.54s -> 34000.58s]  and yeah I guess I'll do it I don't have any intention to go on podcasts
[34000.58s -> 34012.53s]  or kind of IEC the collab with X or collab with Y you know it just happens

[34048.99s -> 34052.15s]  don't do something to the fullest of my abilities there's no point in
[34052.15s -> 34055.51s]  doing it at all it can be a suffocating and depressing way to view
[34055.51s -> 34058.43s]  the world but I don't know how to drop it PS your hair does look good
[34058.43s -> 34064.25s]  I'm just used to short hair and couldn't handle the change advice for
[34064.25s -> 34077.39s]  perfectionist except the fact that you trying your best is good enough you
[34077.39s -> 34084.58s]  have to accept the fact that it can't be perfect I have to come to terms
[34084.58s -> 34088.77s]  with kind of just kind of shit all the time whether it's in your daily
