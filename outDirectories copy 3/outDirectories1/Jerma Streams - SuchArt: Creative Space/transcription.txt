[0.82s -> 9.22s]  Too many of you guys bet on this sure thing and it works until it doesn't.
[9.22s -> 14.28s]  There were millions of channel points that said I would not be live
[14.28s -> 20.68s]  in the next 15 minutes. That was about seven minutes ago.
[20.68s -> 28.81s]  I know that 98% of the time that's accurate, but not this time.
[29.99s -> 32.87s]  Kind of pay it out. Big payday.
[39.10s -> 44.62s]  6.1 million goes to MeowMix and 341 other people.
[45.42s -> 51.72s]  Nice job. Make sure I tweet this out.
[57.37s -> 62.01s]  Hi guys, welcome to a late night edition of the live stream.
[62.65s -> 68.36s]  We're going to play a chill game today, but I know I say that every time.
[68.36s -> 69.56s]  And it ends up not being that.
[71.34s -> 73.02s]  Well, it's a late night version of the stream.
[74.31s -> 78.63s]  We're going to play, I saw it pop up the other day, or today to be more specific,
[78.63s -> 80.79s]  Such Art Creative Space.
[82.17s -> 83.45s]  This is going to be a painting stream.
[84.17s -> 85.37s]  I'm going to paint pictures.
[86.01s -> 87.61s]  You can get commissions.
[87.61s -> 89.37s]  You can sell your paintings and shit.
[90.17s -> 92.07s]  It looks really fun.
[92.07s -> 93.59s]  This is not the full game though.
[93.59s -> 98.12s]  I think the full game comes out in like a month or two.
[98.92s -> 102.12s]  This is a free starter edition of the game, I guess.
[102.12s -> 102.52s]  I don't know.
[103.16s -> 106.79s]  It looks like there's a lot of content there for it being just a random starter edition.
[107.43s -> 112.38s]  It's kind of like a demo, but it's more than a demo.
[112.38s -> 113.82s]  EA. This is not an EA game.
[113.82s -> 115.02s]  What are you talking about?
[115.02s -> 118.18s]  You already played this game.
[118.18s -> 118.66s]  I did not.
[119.56s -> 125.56s]  I played a passive, passive pout, passive pout, the artist game.
[125.56s -> 126.65s]  This one's different.
[127.83s -> 130.63s]  I think this one's a little more involved than that one is.
[133.11s -> 133.67s]  What was it called?
[133.67s -> 139.29s]  Passpart, passpartout, passpartout.
[139.29s -> 140.33s]  No, not pat upon.
[142.89s -> 143.93s]  Passpartout.
[144.73s -> 145.13s]  Right.
[145.13s -> 151.11s]  There it is.
[151.11s -> 152.39s]  CVD brain.
[152.39s -> 153.75s]  No, not tonight.
[153.75s -> 155.99s]  I don't know what happened two, three nights ago, man.
[155.99s -> 156.71s]  I have no idea.
[158.09s -> 161.61s]  I walked in a circle in the third Hitman level.
[161.93s -> 165.29s]  25 straight minutes and just was yelling at myself.
[166.90s -> 168.58s]  Didn't I talk shit about parking garages?
[169.22s -> 170.52s]  I don't know what happened.
[171.48s -> 172.60s]  Everything was going so well.
[173.40s -> 176.04s]  And then I just started talking shit about parking garages.
[176.04s -> 178.12s]  And I walked in a circle for 20 minutes and I turned the stream on.
[180.02s -> 180.66s]  What the fuck happened?
[185.40s -> 187.00s]  He fucking hates concrete.
[187.00s -> 189.72s]  Yeah, I was talking about how concrete sucks and stuff.
[189.72s -> 190.20s]  I don't know.
[190.84s -> 200.47s]  Well, we'll just pretend that last 20 minutes of the last stream didn't happen.
[201.11s -> 203.94s]  You're not supposed to drink the bong water.
[204.50s -> 206.50s]  Well, you're not supposed to tell me how to live my life.
[207.14s -> 209.21s]  Hey, thank you.
[209.21s -> 211.13s]  Unionize your workplace with the 10 community subs.
[211.13s -> 211.61s]  Appreciate it.
[212.81s -> 213.21s]  Thank you.
[215.53s -> 221.80s]  This game has Twitch integration and I think it's on,
[221.80s -> 223.24s]  but I don't have any idea what it is.
[223.96s -> 226.90s]  So it's on right now, but I don't know what that means.
[227.78s -> 229.06s]  I guess we'll find out.
[230.92s -> 232.52s]  EasyCache and InkCat.
[232.52s -> 233.32s]  Thanks for the subs, too.
[234.12s -> 236.28s]  10 from EasyCache and 5 from InkCat.
[236.28s -> 236.76s]  Thanks, guys.
[237.40s -> 242.76s]  What are your opinions on cheese?
[243.85s -> 244.49s]  I love cheese.
[245.45s -> 246.73s]  That stuff's awesome.
[248.65s -> 250.73s]  Dogchompers.
[250.73s -> 252.17s]  Thanks for the 5 community subs.
[258.06s -> 258.54s]  Gooey.
[259.66s -> 261.66s]  It's just ooey gooey cheesy.
[263.48s -> 264.52s]  Name 10 cheeses.
[264.52s -> 264.92s]  Brie.
[266.22s -> 266.62s]  Gouda.
[268.74s -> 269.14s]  Swiss.
[270.25s -> 270.89s]  Havarti.
[271.53s -> 272.90s]  American.
[273.86s -> 274.26s]  Cheddar.
[277.35s -> 278.39s]  Gruyere.
[278.39s -> 279.43s]  Oh, Gruyere.
[281.11s -> 282.63s]  Three more and I'm done with this.
[288.36s -> 288.76s]  Jack.
[289.40s -> 290.12s]  Jack cheese.
[292.17s -> 292.49s]  Jack.
[293.13s -> 294.17s]  Two more and I win.
[299.82s -> 300.54s]  Provolone.
[301.50s -> 302.62s]  And the final one.
[303.58s -> 303.98s]  Feta.
[304.70s -> 305.18s]  Thank you.
[306.06s -> 307.34s]  Just named 10 cheeses.
[309.62s -> 312.82s]  25 community, but this is this 35 community subs are EasyCache.
[313.90s -> 314.78s]  Giving too much money.
[315.42s -> 318.94s]  Thanks for the 35 community subs.
[318.94s -> 320.14s]  That's EasyCache.
[322.30s -> 322.94s]  MintyFox.
[322.94s -> 323.74s]  Thanks for 5 subs.
[325.13s -> 325.69s]  Let's just, what are you?
[325.69s -> 326.17s]  Let's get started.
[326.17s -> 326.49s]  Let's do it.
[327.77s -> 328.41s]  Jack cheese.
[328.41s -> 329.53s]  Havarti is not a cheese.
[329.53s -> 330.33s]  What the hell is it then?
[330.81s -> 332.95s]  What is Havarti?
[339.80s -> 340.44s]  I love Havarti.
[340.44s -> 341.08s]  Havarti is awesome.
[341.72s -> 347.58s]  Havarti is kind of like, it's a cheese that just sort of sits there.
[347.58s -> 351.51s]  And the flavor of Havarti is sort of just like you,
[351.51s -> 354.79s]  it doesn't even really taste like much, but you know it's cheese.
[354.79s -> 355.99s]  So you just put it on your sandwich.
[361.18s -> 363.34s]  It's just like a square that has cheese texture
[363.34s -> 365.18s]  and it kind of has like a hint of cheese flavor.
[365.82s -> 370.78s]  Realistically, like Havarti on your sandwich is just like an extra 140 calories.
[371.42s -> 373.70s]  But I like it though, and it melts really well.
[373.70s -> 375.94s]  So it's nice melty, ooey, cheesy, gooey.
[375.94s -> 376.42s]  You know what I mean?
[377.88s -> 378.84s]  You're stalling.
[378.84s -> 380.60s]  Look, this is a late night stream, all right?
[380.60s -> 382.12s]  This is a late night stream.
[387.13s -> 387.69s]  Stalling.
[387.69s -> 389.69s]  I'm about to paint paintings.
[395.19s -> 396.39s]  All right, that's enough out of you guys.
[397.03s -> 398.22s]  All right, let's go.
[399.02s -> 400.65s]  We're going to move on to here.
[400.65s -> 402.17s]  This is, I guess it's turned on.
[402.73s -> 405.98s]  This is called Such Art Creative Space.
[406.54s -> 411.90s]  He's stalling.
[411.90s -> 412.46s]  I'm not stalling.
[412.46s -> 413.58s]  What are you talking about?
[413.58s -> 418.28s]  Okay, I am now.
[418.28s -> 419.80s]  Like, I'm definitely stalling right now
[419.80s -> 420.84s]  because I just looked at my phone.
[421.40s -> 423.42s]  All right, let's go.
[423.98s -> 425.59s]  There's a story mode.
[425.59s -> 427.03s]  Let's take a look at what it's going to look like.
[427.03s -> 428.71s]  Add this to your wish list.
[430.49s -> 433.48s]  Oh man, I can't wait for this to come out.
[433.48s -> 435.96s]  A bigger, nicer, well-equipped studio?
[435.96s -> 437.94s]  Full creative mode?
[437.94s -> 439.14s]  A virtual gallery?
[442.44s -> 443.00s]  A story?
[443.00s -> 443.88s]  I almost burped.
[443.88s -> 446.04s]  A full story involving robots, aliens,
[446.04s -> 448.46s]  and the very fate of the solar system.
[448.46s -> 450.38s]  What is money if there is no fame?
[450.38s -> 452.38s]  Let the whole solar system know about you
[452.94s -> 456.06s]  as you become more famous.
[456.06s -> 456.70s]  Cool.
[456.70s -> 458.90s]  All right, so let's go.
[458.90s -> 459.86s]  I'm just going to paint.
[459.86s -> 460.42s]  How's the audio?
[460.42s -> 461.14s]  Should we turn it up?
[461.14s -> 466.10s]  There's music.
[467.59s -> 469.59s]  Is Twitch enabled?
[469.59s -> 470.31s]  You're connected.
[470.31s -> 471.11s]  Jerma985.
[471.11s -> 472.31s]  I don't even know what this means.
[472.31s -> 473.96s]  I guess we'll find out right now.
[473.96s -> 475.88s]  Here we go.
[475.88s -> 478.92s]  A, B, C, D, E, B.
[478.92s -> 480.12s]  What's your artist's name?
[481.40s -> 484.73s]  How about Jeremy?
[485.98s -> 487.02s]  Jeremy the Great.
[489.66s -> 490.14s]  Jerry.
[491.51s -> 492.66s]  Jerry.
[492.66s -> 494.18s]  I'm your uncle Jerry.
[494.18s -> 496.47s]  You're my uncle Gary.
[496.47s -> 497.91s]  I am my uncle Jerry.
[499.45s -> 507.64s]  Jerry.
[507.64s -> 509.24s]  The year is 2130
[509.24s -> 510.44s]  and you have just received the result
[510.44s -> 512.60s]  of your professional compatibility DNA test.
[514.52s -> 516.06s]  Huh?
[516.06s -> 517.26s]  Your genome indicates
[517.26s -> 519.74s]  that you have rare artistic talent.
[519.74s -> 525.53s]  For decades, art has been...
[525.53s -> 528.01s]  I feel like that would be way too stressful.
[528.01s -> 531.40s]  That would put a ton of pressure on you
[531.40s -> 532.52s]  your whole life.
[532.52s -> 536.68s]  Can you imagine having you be like
[536.68s -> 539.45s]  50, 12, 13, 14, 15 years old?
[539.45s -> 540.09s]  It's like, hey, you know,
[540.09s -> 542.01s]  you have the rare artistic gene.
[542.01s -> 544.01s]  You should be so good at art.
[544.01s -> 545.29s]  Are you?
[545.29s -> 547.29s]  And you haven't like explored it yet.
[547.29s -> 548.65s]  That would be so much pressure.
[548.65s -> 550.20s]  What if you like didn't think
[550.20s -> 551.32s]  you did a good enough job?
[551.32s -> 556.79s]  That would freak me out.
[556.79s -> 558.39s]  For decades, art has been largely dominated
[558.39s -> 562.76s]  by robots and other artificial intelligence.
[562.76s -> 565.24s]  But in these times of artistic perfection
[565.24s -> 567.32s]  and homogeneity,
[567.32s -> 569.64s]  the world of art has become stale
[569.64s -> 572.89s]  and in need of renewal.
[572.89s -> 574.33s]  It is time for you to act.
[574.33s -> 578.95s]  As on earth, the threat of a robot revolt is rising.
[578.95s -> 580.07s]  What the fuck is going on?
[580.07s -> 582.82s]  An alien species, the Crabucks,
[582.82s -> 585.16s]  covet the planet's saltwater.
[585.16s -> 586.60s]  Only you can decide what to paint
[586.60s -> 587.96s]  on your next canvas.
[587.96s -> 589.69s]  What does this have to do with painting?
[589.69s -> 592.36s]  We're being harvested by aliens?
[592.36s -> 595.42s]  But so far you have yet to be granted a studio
[595.42s -> 600.78s]  aboard the International Space City.
[600.78s -> 602.86s]  In order to get ready to revolutionize the world of art
[602.86s -> 604.70s]  and while waiting for your real studio,
[604.70s -> 606.46s]  you have been provided with a virtual space
[606.46s -> 610.86s]  of artistic simulation.
[610.86s -> 612.62s]  You activate your hollow headset
[612.62s -> 615.00s]  and connect to your virtual studio.
[615.00s -> 616.60s]  This isn't a VR game, right?
[616.60s -> 619.24s]  This looks like you're about to go into a VR portion.
[619.24s -> 620.28s]  Is this VR?
[620.28s -> 622.25s]  I hope it's not.
[622.25s -> 623.37s]  I didn't look.
[623.37s -> 625.34s]  I didn't look.
[625.34s -> 626.70s]  I didn't even look.
[626.70s -> 630.90s]  Is it?
[630.90s -> 632.18s]  Streamer menu.
[632.18s -> 634.92s]  Oh no, hold on.
[634.92s -> 635.56s]  I don't want to look.
[635.56s -> 636.28s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[636.28s -> 639.11s]  Did I lose connection?
[639.11s -> 641.62s]  Nobody look.
[641.62s -> 643.85s]  I don't want to spoil anything.
[643.85s -> 644.57s]  Nobody look.
[644.57s -> 651.99s]  Oh no, a red connection error.
[651.99s -> 652.55s]  Hold on.
[652.55s -> 653.74s]  All right.
[653.74s -> 654.62s]  There's no spoilers here.
[654.62s -> 655.90s]  I thought that might be spoilers.
[655.90s -> 657.66s]  It kind of is.
[657.66s -> 661.78s]  There's my-
[661.78s -> 662.90s]  What happened to my cursor?
[662.90s -> 665.13s]  Okay.
[665.99s -> 667.27s]  Challenge my skills.
[667.27s -> 668.55s]  Challenge my style.
[668.55s -> 669.43s]  Boo me.
[669.43s -> 671.77s]  Rate my painting.
[671.77s -> 677.27s]  Have you just completed a painting or a challenge?
[677.27s -> 678.23s]  Time to get booed.
[682.65s -> 683.45s]  Did that do anything?
[689.51s -> 691.51s]  I don't think the streamer menu works.
[691.51s -> 695.14s]  I have a red connection error.
[695.14s -> 698.55s]  Maybe it's not working right now.
[698.55s -> 699.75s]  Oh well.
[699.75s -> 701.94s]  Did I just turn it off?
[701.94s -> 705.38s]  Connect.
[705.38s -> 707.64s]  You're not connected.
[707.64s -> 708.44s]  Well, why not?
[708.44s -> 715.74s]  It doesn't-
[715.74s -> 717.43s]  You're connected.
[717.43s -> 717.91s]  Oh, shit.
[717.91s -> 718.31s]  Here we go.
[718.31s -> 718.87s]  All right.
[718.87s -> 720.73s]  What do you guys think?
[720.73s -> 722.60s]  Boo me.
[722.60s -> 727.48s]  Boo or applaud.
[727.48s -> 729.00s]  Only five of you have voted?
[729.00s -> 732.84s]  Is it actually boo?
[734.68s -> 735.00s]  All right.
[738.68s -> 741.80s]  This is acting like half the time that I have diarrhea.
[741.80s -> 742.84s]  I just want to be clear.
[742.84s -> 746.89s]  Can I stop and poll?
[746.89s -> 750.25s]  All right.
[750.25s -> 751.80s]  Let's see what you guys say.
[751.80s -> 753.24s]  This is too long to boo.
[753.24s -> 756.06s]  Is that too-
[756.06s -> 757.18s]  Was that gross?
[757.18s -> 759.80s]  That was kind of gross what I just said, isn't it?
[759.80s -> 761.75s]  I have zero dollars.
[761.75s -> 762.47s]  All right.
[762.47s -> 763.03s]  All right.
[763.03s -> 763.67s]  Let's see.
[763.67s -> 769.50s]  Okay.
[769.50s -> 771.48s]  Thanks.
[771.48s -> 771.72s]  Paint.
[771.72s -> 774.49s]  To paint with a brush you have in hand, press right.
[774.49s -> 774.81s]  Whoa.
[774.81s -> 777.11s]  Hold on.
[777.19s -> 779.43s]  Select another object present in your inventory.
[779.43s -> 782.20s]  Use mouse wheel.
[782.20s -> 783.08s]  Oh, shit.
[783.08s -> 783.64s]  I shouldn't-
[783.64s -> 790.02s]  This is my house.
[790.02s -> 792.36s]  Is that a distinct paint on the wall?
[792.36s -> 792.52s]  All right.
[792.52s -> 793.72s]  What else do I have?
[793.72s -> 794.60s]  Oh, shit.
[794.60s -> 795.64s]  Throw an object.
[795.64s -> 796.44s]  Press E.
[796.44s -> 798.28s]  Okay.
[798.28s -> 799.48s]  This game is going to be fun.
[799.48s -> 804.66s]  You pick up the object you threw, aim at it, and keep pressing without moving.
[804.66s -> 805.54s]  Ah.
[805.54s -> 809.75s]  Thanks to the wonders of artificial gravity, you can also press space and jump.
[809.75s -> 810.94s]  Cool.
[810.94s -> 813.74s]  Press left control to crouch and paint the ugly floor.
[813.74s -> 819.05s]  This is-
[819.69s -> 820.95s]  It's like a toddler.
[820.95s -> 821.51s]  Okay.
[821.51s -> 823.67s]  Wait, do we have a canvas?
[823.67s -> 825.72s]  You don't have any commissions.
[825.72s -> 827.00s]  After you flush what?
[827.00s -> 831.35s]  Place a finished painting on the support to send it to a customer.
[831.35s -> 834.23s]  After you flush a painting down the toilet.
[834.23s -> 837.11s]  After you finish a small painting, place it here and send it to your client.
[837.11s -> 837.67s]  Okay.
[837.67s -> 841.58s]  Those are my emails.
[841.58s -> 841.82s]  Hold on.
[841.82s -> 843.34s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[843.34s -> 843.90s]  I'm excited.
[843.90s -> 844.46s]  Hold on.
[844.46s -> 845.26s]  Was-
[845.26s -> 850.98s]  I have a paint roller?
[850.98s -> 853.32s]  No, don't fuck this up already.
[853.32s -> 855.88s]  Press F to do a-
[855.88s -> 856.36s]  Oh, wait.
[856.36s -> 862.28s]  I can go like this?
[862.28s -> 863.00s]  Okay.
[863.00s -> 865.74s]  So I can go vertical or horizontal.
[865.74s -> 867.80s]  I just testing.
[867.80s -> 869.72s]  Holy shit.
[869.72s -> 870.68s]  There's so many slots.
[870.68s -> 871.72s]  This is my canvas.
[871.72s -> 875.27s]  Take a photo.
[875.27s -> 876.86s]  What?
[876.94s -> 877.58s]  Holy shit.
[877.58s -> 878.30s]  This is awesome.
[878.30s -> 878.94s]  What is this?
[878.94s -> 882.54s]  It's like ice cream station.
[882.54s -> 884.86s]  Choose a color and tone to get the paint you want.
[884.86s -> 893.80s]  You can access your photos from the main menu or in-game using the computer.
[893.80s -> 894.76s]  Oh, cool.
[894.76s -> 896.10s]  How do I put this down?
[896.10s -> 897.74s]  Is there a hairdryer?
[897.74s -> 902.52s]  By the way, why is there a hairdryer?
[902.52s -> 917.10s]  Is this drying the paint?
[917.10s -> 917.34s]  Okay.
[917.34s -> 917.90s]  This is so-
[917.90s -> 919.18s]  Why is there a broom too?
[919.18s -> 925.88s]  I'm gonna prime this canvas.
[925.88s -> 926.76s]  Access your photos.
[926.76s -> 927.08s]  Cool.
[927.96s -> 928.84s]  From the main menu.
[928.84s -> 929.16s]  From the-
[929.16s -> 932.58s]  Oh, and the computer.
[932.58s -> 934.30s]  Photos.
[934.30s -> 935.02s]  Whoa!
[935.02s -> 936.44s]  That's not that exciting.
[936.44s -> 937.32s]  Whatever.
[937.32s -> 938.52s]  Emails.
[938.52s -> 939.24s]  Painting order.
[939.24s -> 939.88s]  Welcome to your-
[939.88s -> 940.90s]  Hold on.
[940.90s -> 942.18s]  Dear Jerry.
[942.18s -> 944.41s]  Welcome to your virtual art simulation space.
[945.13s -> 947.05s]  Following the results of your latest DNA test
[947.86s -> 949.86s]  and a view of your immense artistic potential,
[949.86s -> 951.86s]  you've been registered in the Talent Development Program,
[951.86s -> 953.14s]  a United Earth program.
[953.70s -> 955.86s]  Until a real studio is assigned to your name,
[955.86s -> 958.98s]  this simplified virtual studio will allow you to familiarize yourself with all this stuff.
[959.62s -> 961.82s]  Cool.
[961.82s -> 962.38s]  All right.
[962.38s -> 963.26s]  That's all I send back.
[964.57s -> 965.29s]  Order.
[965.29s -> 966.09s]  What I want?
[966.09s -> 967.69s]  Something very powerful.
[967.69s -> 969.13s]  Use a small canvas, please.
[969.13s -> 972.23s]  Would 220 dollars be enough?
[972.23s -> 974.04s]  I mean powerful.
[974.04s -> 974.76s]  Small canvas.
[974.76s -> 975.56s]  That's enough?
[975.56s -> 976.12s]  Sure.
[976.12s -> 977.35s]  How long do you-
[977.35s -> 978.31s]  How long do I have?
[978.31s -> 982.04s]  Okay.
[982.04s -> 983.96s]  Small canvas or something powerful?
[983.96s -> 986.20s]  I need a canvas.
[986.20s -> 987.90s]  All right.
[987.90s -> 989.62s]  Change canvas.
[989.62s -> 990.34s]  Small.
[990.34s -> 992.62s]  Good.
[994.98s -> 996.10s]  Can I make the FOV bigger?
[998.97s -> 999.93s]  Where's like FOV?
[1000.57s -> 1004.62s]  There's no FOV, is there?
[1006.14s -> 1006.78s]  No FOV?
[1007.42s -> 1008.90s]  That's all right.
[1008.90s -> 1009.14s]  What is it?
[1009.14s -> 1010.34s]  It looks like it's 90.
[1010.34s -> 1010.66s]  All right.
[1010.66s -> 1011.22s]  Small canvas.
[1011.22s -> 1011.46s]  Here we go.
[1011.46s -> 1012.50s]  That's not a small canvas.
[1012.50s -> 1013.30s]  This is huge.
[1013.30s -> 1014.02s]  This is fucking-
[1014.02s -> 1015.14s]  He's like an entire wall.
[1026.25s -> 1026.73s]  And this?
[1026.73s -> 1027.77s]  Well, how do I make this small?
[1028.41s -> 1031.48s]  After you finish painting,
[1031.48s -> 1032.92s]  use the terminal to send it to your client.
[1033.56s -> 1035.02s]  Change canvas.
[1035.98s -> 1036.30s]  Wait.
[1036.30s -> 1036.78s]  Smaller.
[1037.34s -> 1040.36s]  How do I make a small canvas?
[1041.08s -> 1048.84s]  Small canvas is already on the wall.
[1048.84s -> 1049.16s]  Where?
[1050.60s -> 1051.08s]  Oh shit.
[1051.08s -> 1051.56s]  It's right here.
[1053.51s -> 1054.07s]  Oh fuck.
[1054.07s -> 1054.31s]  Okay.
[1054.31s -> 1054.55s]  Let's go.
[1054.55s -> 1054.71s]  All right.
[1054.71s -> 1057.62s]  Something powerful.
[1057.62s -> 1058.66s]  Okay guys.
[1058.66s -> 1060.02s]  Why don't you challenge my style?
[1060.74s -> 1060.98s]  No.
[1062.04s -> 1062.36s]  No.
[1062.36s -> 1063.88s]  We're not doing any of this right now.
[1063.88s -> 1064.04s]  Yeah.
[1064.04s -> 1064.60s]  Fuck all this.
[1064.60s -> 1065.40s]  I'm not doing any of this.
[1066.04s -> 1067.43s]  All right.
[1067.43s -> 1068.31s]  Something powerful.
[1069.75s -> 1070.23s]  All right.
[1070.23s -> 1071.19s]  I need paints.
[1071.19s -> 1072.18s]  All right.
[1072.18s -> 1073.22s]  What should I get?
[1073.22s -> 1074.42s]  Raspberry sauce?
[1074.42s -> 1075.94s]  Yep.
[1075.94s -> 1076.82s]  Give me this.
[1076.82s -> 1077.38s]  Raspberry?
[1077.94s -> 1078.10s]  Wait.
[1078.10s -> 1078.98s]  These are spray paints.
[1079.54s -> 1080.26s]  What?
[1080.26s -> 1080.82s]  Oh my God.
[1080.82s -> 1081.70s]  I love spray paint.
[1083.46s -> 1084.58s]  I love spray paint.
[1091.78s -> 1092.66s]  This is cool.
[1092.66s -> 1099.46s]  All right.
[1099.46s -> 1100.10s]  I love this.
[1100.10s -> 1100.34s]  All right.
[1100.34s -> 1100.98s]  This game is a lot.
[1100.98s -> 1101.14s]  Wait.
[1101.14s -> 1102.02s]  Is this a sponge too?
[1106.89s -> 1107.61s]  You can clean?
[1108.57s -> 1110.09s]  Uh-oh guys.
[1110.09s -> 1111.85s]  I may have found.
[1112.65s -> 1113.61s]  Uh-oh.
[1113.61s -> 1116.14s]  I think I may have found
[1117.66s -> 1120.14s]  a game of the year 2021.
[1120.14s -> 1121.02s]  It's possible.
[1121.02s -> 1122.46s]  Let's not get too excited here.
[1124.02s -> 1125.06s]  I don't want to get too excited
[1125.06s -> 1125.94s]  but I may have found it.
[1125.94s -> 1128.02s]  And this shit is just free right now.
[1128.02s -> 1129.62s]  This game doesn't cost any money.
[1131.24s -> 1132.28s]  The one that costs money
[1132.28s -> 1133.88s]  is coming out like in a month or two.
[1133.88s -> 1134.81s]  That's a lie.
[1134.81s -> 1135.45s]  I don't know.
[1135.45s -> 1136.41s]  It says coming soon.
[1142.04s -> 1143.56s]  Oh, it feels so good.
[1146.65s -> 1146.89s]  Okay.
[1146.89s -> 1148.17s]  Just get rid of this for a second.
[1148.17s -> 1149.37s]  I need to have a station set up.
[1149.93s -> 1151.21s]  I want this first.
[1151.21s -> 1151.85s]  What do I want this for?
[1151.85s -> 1152.73s]  I'm going to dump paint on this
[1152.73s -> 1153.69s]  and spray paint it.
[1153.69s -> 1153.85s]  Yeah.
[1153.85s -> 1154.09s]  Hold on.
[1154.09s -> 1154.41s]  Wait.
[1154.41s -> 1154.73s]  Powerful.
[1154.73s -> 1154.97s]  Power.
[1154.97s -> 1155.29s]  I'll give you.
[1155.29s -> 1155.85s]  I'll give you power.
[1155.85s -> 1156.33s]  What does this do?
[1157.05s -> 1159.78s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1159.78s -> 1160.26s]  That's too high.
[1160.90s -> 1163.66s]  You can flip it.
[1163.66s -> 1164.06s]  Ooh.
[1164.06s -> 1165.10s]  You can rotate it.
[1165.74s -> 1168.10s]  You can tilt it back.
[1168.10s -> 1168.82s]  Tilt it forward.
[1168.82s -> 1169.06s]  All right.
[1169.06s -> 1169.30s]  Cool.
[1169.30s -> 1169.46s]  Cool.
[1169.46s -> 1169.70s]  Cool.
[1169.94s -> 1170.58s]  I'm excited.
[1171.30s -> 1171.86s]  What should I do?
[1172.58s -> 1181.24s]  How do I spin this?
[1191.02s -> 1191.50s]  Oh, man.
[1191.50s -> 1192.22s]  That's a good start.
[1192.78s -> 1195.59s]  Let's get the sculpting tool.
[1202.02s -> 1202.26s]  What?
[1204.58s -> 1204.98s]  Dude.
[1205.70s -> 1206.66s]  Holy fuck.
[1206.66s -> 1207.30s]  This is cool.
[1210.74s -> 1211.38s]  Dip it in the blue.
[1214.71s -> 1216.07s]  I got to make sure before anything happens.
[1216.07s -> 1217.11s]  I got to fucking sign this.
[1217.91s -> 1220.78s]  All right.
[1220.78s -> 1221.26s]  Now let's do...
[1221.90s -> 1222.54s]  Give me the brush.
[1224.74s -> 1225.54s]  How do I wash this?
[1226.74s -> 1227.30s]  Does it combine?
[1227.94s -> 1229.22s]  I think it combined.
[1229.22s -> 1233.50s]  It is combining.
[1233.50s -> 1234.62s]  Dude, this is fucking crazy.
[1234.62s -> 1235.34s]  It's combining.
[1235.34s -> 1236.62s]  It's combining the colors.
[1237.18s -> 1248.86s]  Let's get some red in there.
[1248.86s -> 1254.63s]  What's this?
[1256.68s -> 1257.00s]  Salt?
[1257.64s -> 1261.78s]  Oh, it's like a little pounder.
[1261.78s -> 1262.02s]  Wait.
[1262.02s -> 1262.58s]  Hold on.
[1262.58s -> 1273.45s]  What is this thing?
[1273.45s -> 1274.89s]  This is like the pitcher's bag.
[1274.89s -> 1280.47s]  This has got to be powerful.
[1280.47s -> 1281.91s]  I did my first painting.
[1281.91s -> 1284.47s]  Spread that around.
[1284.47s -> 1286.07s]  We'll make it like kind of dusty.
[1286.07s -> 1288.38s]  I need some green down here.
[1288.38s -> 1296.52s]  Get a little bit more red.
[1296.52s -> 1297.56s]  Layering sucks.
[1297.56s -> 1297.88s]  It's not...
[1297.88s -> 1298.68s]  What do you mean this sucks?
[1298.68s -> 1300.79s]  Did you see the title of this frame?
[1300.79s -> 1301.91s]  This is the background, guys.
[1301.91s -> 1302.87s]  This is nothing but a painting.
[1302.87s -> 1304.87s]  Plus, this art, you can't say art sucks.
[1304.87s -> 1308.07s]  Somebody sold a banana for $150,000 taped to the wall.
[1308.15s -> 1323.51s]  You can't say that.
[1323.51s -> 1324.47s]  I just go.
[1324.47s -> 1325.91s]  I'm an abstract painter.
[1325.91s -> 1330.79s]  What does a spoon do?
[1336.15s -> 1337.70s]  Let me try.
[1340.23s -> 1340.87s]  Eat the paint.
[1340.87s -> 1341.43s]  Wait, you can just...
[1341.99s -> 1342.47s]  Really?
[1342.47s -> 1342.95s]  Hold on.
[1345.29s -> 1345.85s]  What?
[1345.85s -> 1347.75s]  I can just like drip it on there?
[1348.65s -> 1348.97s]  What?
[1358.09s -> 1358.57s]  I need to hold on.
[1358.57s -> 1359.13s]  I need to tilt.
[1362.62s -> 1363.34s]  Throw paint.
[1364.28s -> 1368.06s]  Wait, how do I throw it?
[1371.05s -> 1372.25s]  Hold on a second.
[1372.25s -> 1372.73s]  Back up.
[1375.70s -> 1380.55s]  Holy shit.
[1380.55s -> 1382.31s]  Okay, this looks pretty good so far.
[1382.31s -> 1383.35s]  All right, we got a background.
[1385.77s -> 1388.17s]  Let's get this little one up and just be like...
[1389.77s -> 1390.25s]  What do we do?
[1391.19s -> 1391.99s]  Okay, now we're gonna have...
[1392.79s -> 1393.19s]  Let's see.
[1394.46s -> 1395.42s]  I think it's ready.
[1395.42s -> 1396.22s]  Is everything is ready?
[1396.78s -> 1402.89s]  This looks fucking cool.
[1402.89s -> 1403.93s]  I squeeze some on there.
[1403.93s -> 1404.81s]  All right, let me get the teal.
[1406.38s -> 1407.98s]  Dude, can I just squeeze the paint out?
[1409.38s -> 1411.06s]  Holy shit, you can.
[1412.09s -> 1412.81s]  No, you can't.
[1413.37s -> 1422.95s]  There's nothing left in here.
[1426.07s -> 1427.11s]  No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1427.11s -> 1427.83s]  Where's that other tool?
[1427.83s -> 1428.63s]  The thing you can spread it with.
[1429.27s -> 1430.15s]  Wait, should I dust it?
[1436.23s -> 1436.55s]  Shit.
[1436.55s -> 1437.03s]  No, it's okay.
[1437.03s -> 1438.47s]  It's a big fist coming out.
[1438.47s -> 1439.03s]  Wait, hold on.
[1442.10s -> 1453.43s]  Actually, I kind of like it.
[1453.43s -> 1464.89s]  I'm gonna call this one Tornado.
[1464.89s -> 1474.18s]  I guess with Tasmanian devil in there.
[1474.18s -> 1478.39s]  Okay, where's my painting tools?
[1478.39s -> 1479.59s]  Why is there Nerf gun in here?
[1479.59s -> 1481.78s]  Is there stencils?
[1481.78s -> 1483.88s]  Are you kidding me?
[1483.88s -> 1487.40s]  What?
[1487.40s -> 1492.54s]  Okay, I have to give the Tasmanian devil like a Victory Royale.
[1493.10s -> 1495.96s]  Okay, hold on.
[1495.96s -> 1496.36s]  I need...
[1497.88s -> 1498.92s]  Where are my paint brushes?
[1498.92s -> 1499.96s]  I throw them on the ground.
[1499.96s -> 1509.24s]  This isn't doing anything.
[1509.24s -> 1513.51s]  Where are my brushes?
[1513.51s -> 1514.63s]  I kind of like this so far.
[1516.70s -> 1517.58s]  What do I do with my brushes?
[1520.60s -> 1521.40s]  Where are my paint brushes?
[1524.44s -> 1528.04s]  Oh, they're in my inventory.
[1528.04s -> 1528.76s]  Is this cleaning?
[1529.83s -> 1531.43s]  Oh, you clean your tools.
[1531.43s -> 1531.75s]  Okay.
[1535.13s -> 1536.49s]  Let's test the porridge.
[1536.49s -> 1540.65s]  I sprayed this?
[1540.65s -> 1541.37s]  Wait.
[1541.37s -> 1543.48s]  All right, now I'm gonna...
[1543.48s -> 1544.20s]  I'm gonna...
[1544.20s -> 1545.38s]  Let's...
[1547.64s -> 1554.60s]  I have minus $30 right now for what?
[1554.60s -> 1555.56s]  Minus 30 bucks.
[1555.56s -> 1557.06s]  What?
[1557.06s -> 1558.26s]  Okay, I need this.
[1558.26s -> 1559.54s]  I want it to be...
[1559.54s -> 1562.50s]  Let's have little fine lines just like...
[1564.47s -> 1565.35s]  Make them blue.
[1565.35s -> 1571.03s]  I want it like a teal.
[1571.03s -> 1571.51s]  That looks good.
[1571.51s -> 1572.55s]  Okay, now let's go like this.
[1574.07s -> 1574.71s]  The same color?
[1574.71s -> 1575.27s]  No.
[1575.27s -> 1579.19s]  How about punching someone in the face over here?
[1579.19s -> 1581.72s]  How do you...
[1581.72s -> 1582.92s]  What does the fist look like?
[1591.22s -> 1592.90s]  And the thumb is up here, right?
[1592.90s -> 1605.38s]  Okay.
[1605.38s -> 1607.30s]  Is this a sniffing nose?
[1607.30s -> 1608.50s]  Should it just be a nose?
[1611.03s -> 1612.47s]  Maybe just like a guy...
[1612.47s -> 1614.07s]  Like 3D is nose.
[1614.07s -> 1615.27s]  Cartoon style is like...
[1617.02s -> 1618.62s]  He's like sniffing in something.
[1620.06s -> 1621.10s]  Looks like boogers.
[1623.14s -> 1623.78s]  Hold on.
[1623.78s -> 1624.58s]  Wait.
[1624.58s -> 1625.86s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1625.86s -> 1627.78s]  I think I messed this up.
[1627.78s -> 1628.50s]  I messed this up.
[1629.22s -> 1659.72s]  I have to have like eyes back here bugging out.
[1659.72s -> 1660.92s]  Like, whoa!
[1660.92s -> 1662.20s]  Because it looks 3D.
[1662.20s -> 1664.73s]  It's not a snail.
[1664.73s -> 1666.49s]  No, it's a big sniff.
[1666.49s -> 1676.36s]  This is one of the eyes.
[1676.36s -> 1676.76s]  You know what I mean?
[1679.66s -> 1680.54s]  Is there an undo?
[1680.54s -> 1684.74s]  How do you undo?
[1689.69s -> 1690.81s]  Can I do Ctrl Z?
[1690.81s -> 1692.34s]  No, you can't.
[1692.34s -> 1696.17s]  Oh, they should be white.
[1696.17s -> 1706.54s]  Okay, that's better.
[1706.54s -> 1707.42s]  Okay, good.
[1707.42s -> 1710.70s]  Is this too thick of a brush?
[1710.70s -> 1711.20s]  Yes.
[1714.41s -> 1715.69s]  Way too thick of a brush.
[1716.41s -> 1716.97s]  It's paint.
[1716.97s -> 1717.69s]  You can't undo.
[1717.69s -> 1718.49s]  Well, it's a video game.
[1718.49s -> 1719.05s]  You should...
[1719.05s -> 1720.01s]  Yeah, you can.
[1720.01s -> 1722.15s]  I can fix it.
[1722.15s -> 1722.39s]  Here we go.
[1722.39s -> 1729.67s]  Ready?
[1729.67s -> 1731.27s]  This is so cool.
[1734.86s -> 1739.13s]  I've been like waiting for a million years for a game like this.
[1739.13s -> 1740.65s]  And I know they already exist.
[1740.65s -> 1742.09s]  But this one's better.
[1742.09s -> 1746.36s]  This is a crocodile doing a big sniff.
[1746.36s -> 1751.58s]  What do eyes like attach?
[1751.58s -> 1752.38s]  I don't know.
[1752.38s -> 1763.80s]  It's called painting.
[1763.80s -> 1769.16s]  Or like what?
[1769.16s -> 1770.44s]  Like an elephant?
[1770.44s -> 1772.74s]  Or just a guy?
[1772.74s -> 1773.62s]  Like a green guy?
[1774.26s -> 1781.86s]  Should I make like a big mouth here?
[1781.86s -> 1782.50s]  Like, whoa!
[1783.14s -> 1797.32s]  What do eyes look like?
[1798.76s -> 1799.72s]  Like this?
[1799.72s -> 1800.28s]  This is a hair.
[1800.28s -> 1801.08s]  That can stick.
[1801.72s -> 1811.72s]  Okay, now we need like a mouth going like, what?
[1817.06s -> 1818.50s]  I need teal, right?
[1818.50s -> 1822.04s]  A little bit, a little bit more.
[1822.04s -> 1824.58s]  That's it, right?
[1824.58s -> 1824.98s]  Yeah.
[1824.98s -> 1826.18s]  Wait, did I accidentally touch the purple?
[1826.74s -> 1830.26s]  Is this the same color?
[1830.26s -> 1835.06s]  No, it's not.
[1835.06s -> 1836.02s]  Old and brash.
[1836.02s -> 1837.46s]  Make a pog crocodile.
[1837.46s -> 1838.02s]  All right.
[1838.02s -> 1843.98s]  There it is.
[1843.98s -> 1845.32s]  That's the right one, right?
[1845.32s -> 1852.10s]  I can't tell if it's the same color.
[1852.10s -> 1853.78s]  Okay, he has to be like, whoa!
[1853.78s -> 1856.06s]  I can't mess this up.
[1856.06s -> 1873.51s]  I can...
[1873.51s -> 1874.31s]  No, it's not ruined.
[1874.31s -> 1882.58s]  It's not ruined.
[1882.58s -> 1882.90s]  It's fine.
[1882.90s -> 1883.30s]  It's fine.
[1883.30s -> 1889.80s]  Is this the right color?
[1889.80s -> 1901.43s]  Not the right color.
[1901.43s -> 1902.52s]  Wrong color.
[1902.52s -> 1925.08s]  I need to undo button.
[1925.08s -> 1925.64s]  Fuck!
[1925.64s -> 1926.44s]  No!
[1926.44s -> 1926.92s]  It's okay.
[1930.62s -> 1931.58s]  You can't.
[1931.58s -> 1931.90s]  I know.
[1931.90s -> 1932.38s]  You...
[1932.62s -> 1933.90s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1933.90s -> 1934.46s]  I can fix it.
[1934.46s -> 1935.77s]  I think.
[1935.77s -> 1936.33s]  I can fix it.
[1936.33s -> 1936.81s]  Hold on.
[1936.81s -> 1939.43s]  This one has the right paint on it.
[1939.43s -> 1942.42s]  This one does, right?
[1942.42s -> 1942.98s]  No, it doesn't.
[1942.98s -> 1944.34s]  How do I get that fucking color?
[1944.34s -> 1952.02s]  How did I get this color?
[1952.02s -> 1958.52s]  It's that color.
[1958.52s -> 1959.16s]  It's that one.
[1959.16s -> 1969.27s]  Wait, hold on.
[1969.27s -> 1969.67s]  No!
[1969.67s -> 1982.73s]  What the...
[1982.73s -> 1983.69s]  Get the gun?
[1983.69s -> 1996.34s]  There's nothing in here.
[1996.34s -> 1997.14s]  Holy shit.
[1997.14s -> 1997.78s]  Are you kidding me?
[2001.85s -> 2002.65s]  I want this.
[2002.65s -> 2003.29s]  Somebody wants this.
[2003.29s -> 2003.93s]  Somebody wants this.
[2003.93s -> 2004.49s]  Somebody wants this.
[2004.49s -> 2004.97s]  Somebody wants this.
[2004.97s -> 2005.45s]  Somebody wants this.
[2005.45s -> 2006.09s]  I don't care about anything.
[2006.09s -> 2007.24s]  Who wants it?
[2007.24s -> 2008.12s]  I want this.
[2008.12s -> 2009.69s]  I like the power of your paintings.
[2009.69s -> 2010.89s]  I think you have great potential.
[2010.89s -> 2011.85s]  Here's what I'd like you to paint.
[2011.85s -> 2015.29s]  Abundance in a gothic style would be great.
[2015.29s -> 2015.61s]  Then...
[2015.61s -> 2015.85s]  All right.
[2015.85s -> 2016.57s]  Take it.
[2016.57s -> 2018.09s]  Take it.
[2018.09s -> 2019.05s]  He wants this.
[2019.05s -> 2020.17s]  He wants this one.
[2020.17s -> 2022.28s]  Give it to me.
[2022.28s -> 2026.89s]  Send this painting to Jay's.
[2026.89s -> 2028.38s]  Take it.
[2028.38s -> 2028.86s]  Send the painting.
[2028.86s -> 2029.74s]  Your painting will be sent to the customer.
[2029.74s -> 2031.02s]  There's no virtual gallery in this training program.
[2031.02s -> 2032.30s]  Consider taking a photo.
[2032.30s -> 2032.94s]  Take it.
[2032.94s -> 2036.33s]  He said, I want this.
[2036.33s -> 2039.91s]  I got a text saying, I want this.
[2039.91s -> 2045.26s]  Okay.
[2045.26s -> 2047.27s]  Did I do it?
[2047.27s -> 2048.23s]  Did I get the money?
[2048.23s -> 2060.30s]  It's not done yet, but what do you think about it so far?
[2060.30s -> 2068.54s]  Oh, come on.
[2069.18s -> 2072.78s]  I have to fix it first.
[2072.78s -> 2073.66s]  That's way too many.
[2073.66s -> 2075.42s]  I'm not counting any zeros or any tens.
[2077.62s -> 2078.98s]  Thank you for the 80 bucks.
[2078.98s -> 2079.62s]  You guys thought he did...
[2079.62s -> 2081.46s]  He said he gave me an email that he wants this.
[2081.46s -> 2082.02s]  How do we...
[2082.02s -> 2083.54s]  Does he have like binoculars in my house?
[2084.18s -> 2086.26s]  Is he like over here looking through my window?
[2086.26s -> 2097.27s]  What is it?
[2097.27s -> 2098.55s]  Did they take the average or just the...
[2101.30s -> 2105.11s]  That's fair.
[2105.11s -> 2107.03s]  That is actually kind of fair.
[2107.03s -> 2108.23s]  Oh, I'll take it.
[2108.23s -> 2108.79s]  That's fair.
[2109.99s -> 2111.75s]  Four, five, fucking three.
[2111.75s -> 2112.39s]  What is this?
[2113.03s -> 2115.80s]  Is this like a soft serve ice cream machine?
[2116.36s -> 2119.61s]  Oh, shit.
[2119.61s -> 2120.25s]  Soft serve.
[2120.25s -> 2125.22s]  Oh, whoa.
[2126.17s -> 2127.29s]  It's kind of sour.
[2128.49s -> 2129.69s]  I don't taste any vanilla.
[2134.20s -> 2135.32s]  The credit card?
[2135.32s -> 2138.06s]  What is this?
[2138.06s -> 2142.01s]  What color is this?
[2143.26s -> 2143.74s]  Oh, my God.
[2143.74s -> 2144.14s]  I got it.
[2144.14s -> 2144.46s]  All right.
[2144.46s -> 2150.58s]  I got the color reader.
[2150.58s -> 2150.82s]  Okay.
[2150.82s -> 2151.86s]  Now give me that color.
[2152.42s -> 2170.57s]  Now what do I do?
[2170.57s -> 2171.53s]  Oh, I did it already.
[2172.49s -> 2172.97s]  Oh, no.
[2172.97s -> 2173.53s]  Fuck you.
[2173.53s -> 2174.01s]  Do it again.
[2174.01s -> 2174.57s]  Give me another one.
[2183.54s -> 2183.94s]  No.
[2183.94s -> 2184.90s]  Put it in.
[2184.90s -> 2185.54s]  Stop it.
[2186.34s -> 2187.93s]  What's the range on this?
[2188.73s -> 2188.97s]  All right.
[2188.97s -> 2189.93s]  It's pretty fucking far.
[2201.46s -> 2201.78s]  Nice.
[2203.38s -> 2204.02s]  Yes.
[2204.02s -> 2205.78s]  Finally, I have the right color.
[2205.78s -> 2212.46s]  I need new water.
[2212.46s -> 2223.30s]  Okay.
[2223.30s -> 2224.18s]  Where do I get water?
[2224.18s -> 2229.10s]  Where's the water?
[2229.10s -> 2239.34s]  Place to finish painting on the support.
[2239.34s -> 2240.70s]  I don't even need to do that.
[2240.70s -> 2243.66s]  Canvas printer.
[2243.66s -> 2244.46s]  Oh, shit.
[2244.46s -> 2246.33s]  That's cool.
[2246.33s -> 2247.37s]  What do I get water?
[2247.37s -> 2254.60s]  What if I need a lot more of that?
[2254.60s -> 2257.37s]  Does this cost money?
[2257.37s -> 2260.09s]  I feel like I'm going to need a lot of this paint
[2260.09s -> 2261.29s]  because I'm going to make a couple.
[2261.29s -> 2261.85s]  I like this teal.
[2261.85s -> 2262.89s]  Take my favorite color.
[2262.89s -> 2287.03s]  Teal addict.
[2287.03s -> 2287.91s]  I like teal.
[2288.47s -> 2289.51s]  I love teal.
[2289.51s -> 2296.14s]  I need water.
[2296.14s -> 2297.10s]  I have another bucket.
[2297.10s -> 2297.82s]  I have two buckets.
[2297.82s -> 2298.46s]  I'm fine.
[2299.16s -> 2300.76s]  Trust me when I say that I will use this.
[2300.76s -> 2302.76s]  This is going to be used in every single painting, guys.
[2302.76s -> 2309.90s]  This is a bucket filler.
[2309.90s -> 2318.97s]  If it isn't that, this is water.
[2318.97s -> 2326.07s]  How do I put it down?
[2326.07s -> 2327.27s]  Put it down the drain.
[2328.15s -> 2330.23s]  This shit's stuck there forever.
[2330.23s -> 2332.58s]  Why is this water so cloudy?
[2332.58s -> 2334.10s]  This is cloudy ass water.
[2334.10s -> 2334.58s]  Look at this.
[2336.25s -> 2339.05s]  This is the cloudiest water I've ever seen.
[2339.05s -> 2339.85s]  This is water.
[2340.49s -> 2345.77s]  We'll pick the damn thing up.
[2348.63s -> 2348.95s]  Okay.
[2349.99s -> 2351.94s]  This is just permanently going to be teal.
[2353.02s -> 2353.98s]  It's paint thinner.
[2358.23s -> 2359.91s]  Where's the paint bucket filler that you got?
[2364.33s -> 2365.37s]  Oh, dude.
[2365.37s -> 2365.85s]  There it is.
[2368.76s -> 2370.12s]  Cotton candy ice cream.
[2371.40s -> 2372.84s]  Let me leave my mouth under it.
[2377.11s -> 2378.07s]  Cotton candy.
[2378.87s -> 2383.93s]  Fill it.
[2383.93s -> 2387.42s]  Fill the bucket.
[2387.42s -> 2387.90s]  What are you doing?
[2404.47s -> 2404.87s]  Nice.
[2406.41s -> 2408.25s]  I just fucking throw it over there.
[2408.25s -> 2408.97s]  All right.
[2408.97s -> 2410.49s]  How do I put this down without dumping it?
[2411.05s -> 2413.02s]  I don't know.
[2413.02s -> 2413.90s]  How do you put it down?
[2417.14s -> 2417.62s]  Okay.
[2417.62s -> 2418.90s]  So I have the right color now.
[2418.90s -> 2419.30s]  I'm ready.
[2419.94s -> 2422.39s]  I'm taking my paintbrush.
[2422.39s -> 2423.67s]  I'm going to wait.
[2423.67s -> 2424.23s]  I need water.
[2424.95s -> 2425.61s]  Give me this.
[2426.74s -> 2428.10s]  You're fucking crazy, dude.
[2428.10s -> 2428.42s]  What are you?
[2428.42s -> 2428.66s]  Why?
[2429.30s -> 2443.90s]  This is an art studio.
[2443.90s -> 2445.85s]  I don't understand.
[2445.85s -> 2446.81s]  This is an art studio.
[2449.08s -> 2450.84s]  Go find me an art studio that doesn't have paint
[2450.84s -> 2455.05s]  all over every fucking wall and all over the ground.
[2455.05s -> 2455.21s]  All right.
[2455.21s -> 2455.93s]  Here we go.
[2455.93s -> 2458.26s]  I don't want to use this.
[2458.82s -> 2460.58s]  I want my finesse.
[2461.30s -> 2463.29s]  Where's my finesse brush?
[2463.29s -> 2465.98s]  What happened to it?
[2465.98s -> 2470.73s]  Where's my finesse brush?
[2470.73s -> 2475.08s]  What did I throw?
[2475.08s -> 2482.55s]  I just had it on the floor.
[2482.55s -> 2482.71s]  Yeah.
[2482.71s -> 2482.95s]  Where?
[2482.95s -> 2483.35s]  Where is it?
[2488.20s -> 2488.60s]  Left.
[2488.60s -> 2489.24s]  Left.
[2489.24s -> 2489.48s]  Where?
[2491.93s -> 2493.93s]  How did I get over here?
[2496.28s -> 2496.60s]  Okay.
[2496.60s -> 2496.92s]  Rinse.
[2498.86s -> 2499.34s]  Here we go.
[2499.90s -> 2500.78s]  Time to go.
[2500.78s -> 2501.26s]  Let's do it.
[2501.90s -> 2503.10s]  Let's touch this up a little.
[2507.93s -> 2508.73s]  Thank you.
[2508.73s -> 2509.45s]  All right.
[2509.45s -> 2513.54s]  This is not the right color.
[2513.54s -> 2513.78s]  How?
[2513.78s -> 2514.74s]  Is this the wrong color?
[2514.74s -> 2521.48s]  How is this the wrong color?
[2521.48s -> 2537.24s]  Is it dry?
[2537.24s -> 2542.98s]  Is that what it is?
[2542.98s -> 2543.86s]  It's a work in progress.
[2543.86s -> 2544.50s]  Just wait.
[2544.50s -> 2557.69s]  It's not drying.
[2557.69s -> 2559.21s]  You guys fucking annihilated.
[2560.01s -> 2560.95s]  I'm not.
[2566.33s -> 2566.65s]  Okay.
[2566.65s -> 2568.65s]  When it dries, then I have to put
[2568.65s -> 2593.35s]  like a big open mouth right here.
[2593.35s -> 2594.07s]  D face.
[2595.10s -> 2601.59s]  I mean, it's kind of, but this is happy.
[2601.59s -> 2613.19s]  Dude, I'm an artist.
[2613.19s -> 2623.48s]  Turn off the music.
[2623.48s -> 2626.50s]  Kind of is the same loop, isn't it?
[2626.50s -> 2629.11s]  Need more paint.
[2629.11s -> 2630.38s]  Wrong one.
[2630.38s -> 2633.18s]  Put on an OST.
[2633.18s -> 2635.74s]  I kind of don't want to nuke this VOD though.
[2635.74s -> 2637.50s]  Doesn't that happen every time you do OSTs?
[2637.50s -> 2651.94s]  Okay.
[2651.94s -> 2654.42s]  This is actually, this is starting to be.
[2655.78s -> 2658.78s]  I got to make sure this doesn't turn into like
[2658.78s -> 2661.91s]  a like big green penis.
[2661.91s -> 2663.11s]  I'm trying.
[2663.11s -> 2664.87s]  It'll just wait till it's done.
[2665.34s -> 2667.02s]  Hold off your reservations here.
[2667.02s -> 2672.36s]  Those are clean lines.
[2673.22s -> 2674.90s]  Ah, you guys are relaxed.
[2674.90s -> 2676.34s]  I am so relaxed.
[2679.83s -> 2680.23s]  Okay.
[2680.23s -> 2680.71s]  There it is.
[2680.71s -> 2682.07s]  He's like, whoa.
[2686.47s -> 2686.79s]  Okay.
[2687.35s -> 2689.43s]  Um, now we need teeth.
[2689.43s -> 2692.15s]  He's got like teeth and a big tongue.
[2692.15s -> 2695.58s]  I need white.
[2713.21s -> 2722.28s]  Well, I'll get teeth as he has.
[2722.28s -> 2723.00s]  Too much?
[2723.00s -> 2730.68s]  Too much?
[2738.36s -> 2739.24s]  No, that's all right.
[2739.24s -> 2757.35s]  It's orange.
[2757.35s -> 2758.07s]  Wrong.
[2758.07s -> 2770.28s]  This is like fucked up.
[2781.54s -> 2782.02s]  Okay.
[2782.02s -> 2784.97s]  He's, uh, this is just like, this looks
[2784.97s -> 2786.01s]  really fucking wrong.
[2786.81s -> 2791.19s]  He's like boogers into his own mouth.
[2791.19s -> 2792.15s]  Is that what is happening?
[2792.95s -> 2793.83s]  Get the vote menu.
[2793.83s -> 2795.11s]  No, it's not done yet.
[2795.11s -> 2796.39s]  I'm not taking the menu up.
[2805.69s -> 2806.97s]  I need to see what it looks like.
[2806.97s -> 2811.90s]  And then I got to change it.
[2811.90s -> 2813.42s]  Well, they wanted something powerful.
[2813.42s -> 2814.46s]  They're going to get it.
[2814.46s -> 2818.95s]  And by the way, I'm sorry.
[2818.95s -> 2820.71s]  You don't just commission somebody like
[2820.71s -> 2823.11s]  a famous artist like me.
[2823.11s -> 2824.71s]  Hey, uh, do whatever you want.
[2824.71s -> 2826.90s]  Just make sure it's powerful.
[2826.90s -> 2828.66s]  You have to be ready for anything.
[2828.66s -> 2833.72s]  You might get, you might get human shit in the mail.
[2834.46s -> 2836.54s]  Be careful with what you ask for here.
[2836.54s -> 2841.34s]  Be, you got to be very clear.
[2841.34s -> 2845.06s]  I want it, uh, I want it powerful.
[2845.06s -> 2847.14s]  But, um, use paint and make it look like
[2847.14s -> 2848.18s]  I could show it to my grandmother.
[2848.18s -> 2848.50s]  There you go.
[2848.50s -> 2849.86s]  Powerful, but grandmother.
[2849.86s -> 2854.06s]  Okay.
[2854.06s -> 2861.75s]  Tongues have like a line, right?
[2862.39s -> 2864.33s]  Do tongues have like a line down the middle?
[2873.69s -> 2875.69s]  This looks like it could be,
[2877.96s -> 2880.36s]  I like on the commercial for like an old
[2880.36s -> 2881.72s]  soft drink in the 90s or something.
[2882.97s -> 2884.33s]  In fact, I get an order for you.
[2884.33s -> 2885.05s]  Hold on.
[2885.05s -> 2886.41s]  I think there's like a Nickelodeon ad
[2886.41s -> 2887.77s]  with this exact thing is happening.
[2892.14s -> 2893.10s]  Some of you guys forget this.
[2893.90s -> 2896.46s]  Nickelodeon used to be about like eating boogers
[2896.46s -> 2898.46s]  and like pooping and shitting your pants and stuff.
[2899.10s -> 2903.93s]  Nickelodeon from like the late 80s into the mid 90s
[2903.93s -> 2905.85s]  was about like boogers all over your face
[2905.85s -> 2908.01s]  and like boogies and boogers.
[2908.65s -> 2910.33s]  It was every single thing they did.
[2910.33s -> 2915.16s]  All right.
[2915.16s -> 2916.20s]  I'm selling this one.
[2916.20s -> 2918.58s]  This one's ready.
[2918.58s -> 2919.72s]  Let's start over.
[2920.28s -> 2926.38s]  No, it isn't.
[2926.38s -> 2927.34s]  Yes, it was.
[2927.34s -> 2931.37s]  Actually, this would go on the grid on the bottom
[2931.37s -> 2932.01s]  of a skateboard.
[2932.01s -> 2932.49s]  Don't you think?
[2933.13s -> 2934.50s]  Let's get a picture of this.
[2935.14s -> 2941.94s]  Why am I trying to paint the lens?
[2941.94s -> 2942.74s]  Like that's stupid.
[2943.38s -> 2944.12s]  All right.
[2944.12s -> 2944.84s]  This one's completed.
[2944.84s -> 2945.72s]  I'm going to call this one
[2946.68s -> 2949.40s]  a skateboard t-shirt
[2950.62s -> 2952.46s]  ponyhawk menu t-shirt menu.
[2952.46s -> 2955.58s]  Create a character t-shirt number like 32.
[2956.22s -> 2958.65s]  That's what I'm calling it.
[2958.65s -> 2970.92s]  Okay.
[2970.92s -> 2973.18s]  This is for Solman.
[2973.18s -> 2974.06s]  Solman.
[2974.06s -> 2975.54s]  Here you go.
[2975.54s -> 2976.26s]  Let me know what you think.
[2976.82s -> 2977.94s]  How do I send it to you?
[2977.94s -> 2981.56s]  How do I pick it up?
[2981.56s -> 2988.98s]  It's okay.
[2988.98s -> 2989.54s]  It was dry.
[2989.54s -> 2990.18s]  It was dry.
[2993.32s -> 2994.36s]  Paint side down.
[2994.36s -> 2998.89s]  Okay, Solman.
[2998.89s -> 2999.77s]  Hope you like it.
[3001.85s -> 3002.97s]  Let me know what you guys think.
[3002.97s -> 3003.85s]  Finish painting.
[3003.85s -> 3005.21s]  Rate my painting.
[3005.21s -> 3007.05s]  By the way, 40 seconds is way too long.
[3007.05s -> 3008.33s]  You have like 15 seconds.
[3008.33s -> 3009.13s]  Come on.
[3009.13s -> 3010.95s]  What do you think?
[3010.95s -> 3021.18s]  Okay.
[3021.18s -> 3022.78s]  Okay.
[3022.78s -> 3027.62s]  6.5 out of 10.
[3027.62s -> 3028.18s]  That's not bad.
[3028.82s -> 3031.29s]  That's pretty good, actually.
[3031.29s -> 3032.01s]  I'm happy with that.
[3032.01s -> 3032.81s]  6.5 out of 10.
[3032.81s -> 3035.64s]  That's good.
[3035.64s -> 3037.00s]  I can sell this on a marketplace?
[3037.00s -> 3037.16s]  Wait.
[3037.16s -> 3037.80s]  No, I have a commission.
[3038.44s -> 3038.76s]  Hold on.
[3038.76s -> 3039.48s]  How much are you going to give me?
[3040.12s -> 3042.68s]  This is like how much money is this for?
[3042.68s -> 3043.56s]  Can I sell it for more?
[3046.09s -> 3047.05s]  I can only do one painting.
[3047.77s -> 3049.02s]  220 bucks.
[3049.02s -> 3050.14s]  I'm going to get like 500 for this?
[3050.70s -> 3054.98s]  Oh, I forgot to sign it.
[3054.98s -> 3055.78s]  I forgot to sign it.
[3057.91s -> 3058.55s]  No, I did sign it.
[3058.55s -> 3059.19s]  I just painted over it.
[3059.19s -> 3059.51s]  Hold on.
[3060.39s -> 3061.91s]  Uh, yeah, I got to sign it.
[3061.91s -> 3072.98s]  Okay.
[3072.98s -> 3076.15s]  I'm not doing my real signature.
[3076.15s -> 3077.67s]  That guy freaks me out.
[3077.67s -> 3079.99s]  I'm not going to sign my actual like real signature
[3079.99s -> 3081.59s]  in front of fucking 14,000 people.
[3082.15s -> 3084.65s]  It's kind of sounds dangerous.
[3086.07s -> 3086.47s]  Doesn't it?
[3086.47s -> 3087.59s]  Hey, I don't know if I'm going to do that.
[3088.23s -> 3091.64s]  All right.
[3091.64s -> 3092.52s]  Let's just let's do it.
[3093.16s -> 3095.46s]  I want something very powerful.
[3096.41s -> 3097.13s]  Small canvas.
[3097.13s -> 3097.45s]  Let's go.
[3098.09s -> 3101.38s]  Do you like it?
[3102.02s -> 3111.61s]  How is it?
[3111.61s -> 3113.21s]  Make your signature the channel icon.
[3113.21s -> 3114.09s]  I don't think I can do that.
[3117.32s -> 3118.76s]  Into the shredder it goes.
[3119.64s -> 3119.88s]  All right.
[3119.88s -> 3121.48s]  We're going to go wild for the next one.
[3121.48s -> 3124.12s]  I'm talking just I'm going to just do whatever the fuck I want.
[3124.12s -> 3125.16s]  I'm not going to think about it.
[3125.72s -> 3127.54s]  Did you pay me?
[3134.71s -> 3135.43s]  Target tube.
[3135.99s -> 3140.46s]  Where's my money?
[3144.17s -> 3145.29s]  My name is Dumari.
[3145.29s -> 3146.01s]  I would like to.
[3146.01s -> 3147.85s]  I would have liked to be an artist myself.
[3147.85s -> 3148.65s]  Here's what I'd like you to do.
[3148.65s -> 3149.61s]  Something steampunk.
[3150.89s -> 3152.33s]  No, that's fucking boring.
[3153.29s -> 3154.33s]  My name is Asher.
[3154.33s -> 3156.33s]  I think you can change the world through your artwork.
[3156.33s -> 3157.45s]  Can you paint something for me?
[3157.45s -> 3158.57s]  A skull.
[3158.57s -> 3159.85s]  The size of the canvas is up to you.
[3159.85s -> 3160.01s]  Okay.
[3160.01s -> 3160.97s]  I'll do that one.
[3160.97s -> 3164.01s]  All right.
[3164.01s -> 3164.65s]  I need a big.
[3164.65s -> 3165.61s]  I'm going to do a huge skull.
[3165.61s -> 3166.89s]  I'm going to paint it with this gun too.
[3166.89s -> 3169.37s]  It's going to be like in red paint like a red blood skull.
[3169.37s -> 3170.57s]  There's going to be so much meaning behind it.
[3170.57s -> 3172.74s]  I can't wait.
[3172.74s -> 3173.22s]  And I just like.
[3174.02s -> 3177.21s]  All right.
[3177.21s -> 3177.69s]  Load it up.
[3178.25s -> 3181.66s]  Give me that canvas.
[3183.42s -> 3184.14s]  Change canvas.
[3184.86s -> 3185.90s]  I want a big one.
[3186.62s -> 3187.02s]  This one.
[3187.02s -> 3187.82s]  One by one free.
[3188.46s -> 3190.65s]  Where's my money for the last commission?
[3191.29s -> 3194.33s]  All right.
[3194.33s -> 3194.89s]  I'm going to do it.
[3194.89s -> 3195.05s]  Wait.
[3195.05s -> 3195.53s]  I need a back.
[3195.53s -> 3196.41s]  I need a background to be gray.
[3199.19s -> 3200.31s]  Gray background.
[3200.31s -> 3201.43s]  There's a roller.
[3206.33s -> 3213.48s]  I'm a little tall enough.
[3213.48s -> 3224.62s]  Where did my money for the other one go?
[3229.45s -> 3230.09s]  Oh, shit.
[3230.09s -> 3231.05s]  This whole thing moves.
[3231.61s -> 3235.66s]  I need more paint.
[3235.66s -> 3250.70s]  It's all right if it's a little washed out on the left here.
[3250.70s -> 3252.22s]  It's just it's the background.
[3252.22s -> 3255.91s]  All right.
[3255.91s -> 3256.47s]  Hey, let's go.
[3256.47s -> 3258.79s]  Let's go to the McDonald's and let's get every fucking soda.
[3259.51s -> 3260.55s]  We got sprite.
[3260.55s -> 3261.35s]  We got Powerade.
[3261.35s -> 3262.31s]  We got Powerade blue.
[3262.31s -> 3264.23s]  We've got like Mountain Dew.
[3264.23s -> 3265.03s]  Do the whole thing.
[3265.03s -> 3265.53s]  Yeah.
[3280.20s -> 3280.76s]  There it is.
[3282.12s -> 3282.76s]  Oh, yeah.
[3282.76s -> 3283.16s]  Okay.
[3283.16s -> 3283.56s]  Oh, yeah.
[3298.55s -> 3298.95s]  They go.
[3298.95s -> 3299.67s]  220 bucks.
[3299.67s -> 3299.99s]  Let's go.
[3300.71s -> 3306.07s]  All right.
[3307.03s -> 3307.99s]  That's a pretty good start.
[3313.24s -> 3315.45s]  Not a bad start.
[3315.45s -> 3315.69s]  All right.
[3315.69s -> 3316.01s]  Let's go.
[3316.01s -> 3316.81s]  Give me the gun.
[3316.81s -> 3318.36s]  I told you guys this one was going to be.
[3318.36s -> 3319.24s]  I'm just going to go for it.
[3319.80s -> 3322.50s]  All right.
[3322.50s -> 3323.54s]  We got red in here, right?
[3324.54s -> 3324.86s]  Okay.
[3324.86s -> 3325.66s]  Fill it up with red.
[3327.80s -> 3328.68s]  There it is.
[3328.68s -> 3330.23s]  Let's make this fucking skull.
[3330.95s -> 3332.98s]  What does the skull look like?
[3332.98s -> 3336.07s]  It's got like a big head like.
[3355.08s -> 3355.56s]  Oh, okay.
[3355.56s -> 3360.49s]  Now I need this might give me that paint brush.
[3360.49s -> 3368.70s]  I need white.
[3368.70s -> 3381.69s]  I'm a big T like this looks like one of the enemies from Mario.
[3381.69s -> 3383.94s]  This guy's from Mario 64.
[3383.94s -> 3386.62s]  Oops.
[3386.62s -> 3390.73s]  Who's the Mario enemy that looks like this?
[3390.73s -> 3404.97s]  The swamp?
[3404.97s -> 3405.69s]  Maybe.
[3405.69s -> 3407.90s]  All right.
[3407.90s -> 3409.50s]  Now let's that looks all right.
[3409.50s -> 3413.70s]  It's a skull.
[3413.70s -> 3415.35s]  Um, hold on.
[3415.35s -> 3420.44s]  Let me hothead.
[3420.44s -> 3421.16s]  Yes, that's the one.
[3421.16s -> 3421.64s]  Thank you.
[3421.64s -> 3422.20s]  Hothead.
[3422.20s -> 3430.86s]  Wait, there's a thing in the middle too, right?
[3430.86s -> 3442.90s]  I need red.
[3442.90s -> 3444.02s]  That's kind of like a clown.
[3445.14s -> 3446.74s]  Wait, give me the smear tool.
[3446.74s -> 3447.94s]  That's what I want to use.
[3447.94s -> 3462.60s]  Perfect.
[3462.60s -> 3464.79s]  Sell it.
[3464.79s -> 3466.39s]  Send it quick.
[3466.39s -> 3466.95s]  Skull.
[3466.95s -> 3471.13s]  I need to take a picture of it.
[3471.13s -> 3472.63s]  Oh, well.
[3472.63s -> 3476.71s]  How do I clean up?
[3476.71s -> 3478.55s]  I need to.
[3478.55s -> 3478.79s]  Okay.
[3478.79s -> 3480.31s]  Time to clean up the station here.
[3480.31s -> 3482.58s]  Station cleanup time.
[3482.58s -> 3486.65s]  We didn't even vote for it.
[3486.65s -> 3492.94s]  Oh, vote for that one.
[3492.94s -> 3493.26s]  All right.
[3493.26s -> 3494.54s]  You guys remember what it looked like?
[3494.98s -> 3499.42s]  What was it?
[3499.42s -> 3500.22s]  Well, I clean up.
[3501.02s -> 3501.98s]  A package has arrived.
[3504.58s -> 3511.58s]  Package has arrived?
[3511.58s -> 3514.62s]  Just dump the bucket.
[3514.62s -> 3515.66s]  A two?
[3515.66s -> 3518.04s]  A 2.8?
[3518.04s -> 3518.76s]  Two?
[3518.76s -> 3521.37s]  That was a two.
[3521.37s -> 3524.63s]  That was not a two.
[3524.63s -> 3527.40s]  How was that a two?
[3527.40s -> 3535.10s]  It was zero effort.
[3535.10s -> 3535.74s]  No, it wasn't.
[3535.74s -> 3537.66s]  That was me just going just visceral.
[3537.66s -> 3542.74s]  Not everything has to have a plan.
[3542.74s -> 3544.55s]  Why does everything have to have a plan?
[3544.55s -> 3553.48s]  Everything has to have a plan, Arthur.
[3556.82s -> 3561.66s]  Not everything has to have a plan.
[3561.66s -> 3563.58s]  But it does.
[3563.66s -> 3566.14s]  Doesn't it, Arthur?
[3566.14s -> 3569.35s]  Yeah, doesn't it, Goku?
[3569.35s -> 3570.39s]  I'm not going to do it.
[3570.39s -> 3571.67s]  Some people hate that, by the way.
[3580.10s -> 3583.62s]  I've seen at least half a dozen comments saying,
[3583.62s -> 3585.78s]  I really fucking hate it when he just adds a Goku
[3585.78s -> 3587.62s]  to the end of everything when he does a low voice.
[3590.01s -> 3590.65s]  I've read that.
[3590.65s -> 3591.37s]  I've seen that.
[3601.40s -> 3601.64s]  All right.
[3601.64s -> 3602.92s]  No more just throwing shit on the ground.
[3607.27s -> 3608.55s]  This game is sick, though.
[3608.55s -> 3609.51s]  I love this game.
[3610.15s -> 3612.46s]  This shit's free.
[3613.18s -> 3615.06s]  You don't have to buy it if you don't want to.
[3615.78s -> 3617.56s]  What's the story mode going to be like?
[3617.88s -> 3619.00s]  There's more to this game?
[3619.72s -> 3622.39s]  How did you make this free?
[3625.42s -> 3626.14s]  This is free.
[3627.98s -> 3629.18s]  This is a free game.
[3629.18s -> 3630.62s]  This is 100% for free.
[3634.63s -> 3636.31s]  There's actually no strings attached to this.
[3636.31s -> 3636.79s]  You just go.
[3636.79s -> 3639.11s]  You can play exactly what I'm doing right now for free on Steam.
[3639.75s -> 3642.49s]  This game's called Such Art.
[3643.69s -> 3645.37s]  It's a fucking free game.
[3646.01s -> 3655.05s]  I love the water effects, too.
[3655.05s -> 3656.01s]  A lot of time went into it.
[3656.01s -> 3657.13s]  You can tell time went into this.
[3657.13s -> 3658.17s]  I like this.
[3658.17s -> 3659.45s]  I have an incredible offer for you.
[3659.45s -> 3660.41s]  What is it?
[3660.41s -> 3663.93s]  I'm Arly.
[3664.01s -> 3666.01s]  You're in my top 30 favorite artists.
[3666.01s -> 3667.77s]  I'm so glad a friend told me about you.
[3667.77s -> 3668.57s]  What I want?
[3668.57s -> 3669.29s]  Boredom.
[3669.29s -> 3670.73s]  With your personal touch.
[3670.73s -> 3672.71s]  The size of the canvas is up to you.
[3672.71s -> 3673.75s]  155 bucks.
[3675.38s -> 3676.82s]  You're in my top 30.
[3680.33s -> 3681.21s]  Excellent link.
[3681.21s -> 3681.93s]  Hold on.
[3681.93s -> 3682.81s]  I'll be the judge of that.
[3685.59s -> 3689.83s]  250 million off the debt if you choose a random Bob Ross video and follow along.
[3693.90s -> 3694.14s]  All right.
[3694.14s -> 3697.58s]  Hold on to that one.
[3697.58s -> 3699.18s]  Why is 1 billion scratched off?
[3700.65s -> 3700.89s]  All right.
[3700.89s -> 3701.45s]  Hold on to that one.
[3701.45s -> 3701.85s]  We'll do it.
[3702.71s -> 3703.43s]  That sounds like fun.
[3703.99s -> 3706.95s]  Can I do that?
[3706.95s -> 3710.04s]  Can I watch a Bob Ross painting on Twitch?
[3710.60s -> 3712.49s]  Am I allowed to do that?
[3712.49s -> 3717.78s]  No, that's not like a problem, right?
[3718.34s -> 3719.91s]  All right.
[3719.91s -> 3720.79s]  So anyways, I have spoken.
[3720.79s -> 3721.75s]  So this is what he wants.
[3721.75s -> 3724.95s]  They want boredom with my personal touch.
[3724.95s -> 3725.19s]  Sure.
[3726.42s -> 3727.94s]  Boredom with my personal touch.
[3728.58s -> 3742.81s]  I'm just getting the I'm getting the spot ready.
[3743.45s -> 3744.73s]  No, I don't want the big canvas.
[3744.73s -> 3745.53s]  It's too much for me.
[3746.09s -> 3747.45s]  I want a little canvas.
[3747.45s -> 3749.37s]  This one's perfect.
[3752.34s -> 3752.82s]  This is perfect.
[3753.46s -> 3754.39s]  Spin this around.
[3758.86s -> 3759.58s]  Boredom.
[3759.58s -> 3760.14s]  That's too much.
[3760.14s -> 3760.46s]  You're going.
[3761.10s -> 3762.09s]  You know what?
[3762.73s -> 3763.85s]  Wait a minute.
[3764.41s -> 3768.04s]  Holy shit.
[3768.04s -> 3768.52s]  Wait a minute.
[3779.56s -> 3779.88s]  Whoa.
[3781.51s -> 3781.75s]  Whoa.
[3788.81s -> 3789.37s]  No shit.
[3791.37s -> 3791.69s]  Whoa.
[3796.12s -> 3796.44s]  Cool.
[3796.44s -> 3796.76s]  I like.
[3796.76s -> 3797.08s]  All right.
[3797.08s -> 3797.56s]  I like that.
[3798.95s -> 3800.79s]  This is a rainbow from every two-year-old
[3800.79s -> 3801.75s]  you've ever seen in your life.
[3805.43s -> 3806.55s]  I need Sprite cans.
[3807.19s -> 3808.17s]  All right.
[3808.17s -> 3808.89s]  We got green on there.
[3808.89s -> 3812.76s]  We're doing a little bit this green right here.
[3813.32s -> 3814.20s]  Let's test it.
[3814.84s -> 3815.48s]  It looks all right.
[3816.20s -> 3817.16s]  I'm going to stay far away.
[3817.72s -> 3837.51s]  Dude, this is like rotisserie chickening gas.
[3838.23s -> 3838.63s]  How's that?
[3838.63s -> 3839.03s]  You hear it?
[3843.80s -> 3844.20s]  Cool.
[3844.20s -> 3844.68s]  I like it.
[3844.68s -> 3846.84s]  This is like outside with some grubs outside.
[3847.40s -> 3848.36s]  I need a leaf.
[3848.36s -> 3848.92s]  I need a leaf.
[3849.64s -> 3851.66s]  Is there a leaf stencil?
[3852.94s -> 3853.42s]  Not really.
[3855.37s -> 3855.85s]  That's a leaf.
[3856.49s -> 3860.28s]  Can I make this small?
[3866.23s -> 3869.88s]  Stop spinning.
[3869.88s -> 3871.00s]  I need a leaf right here.
[3877.64s -> 3878.52s]  Grubhub gives you.
[3879.08s -> 3880.95s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[3882.73s -> 3883.05s]  Okay.
[3883.05s -> 3883.85s]  I need a leaf.
[3885.05s -> 3885.13s]  Yeah.
[3885.13s -> 3886.25s]  Somebody's to turn the music off.
[3886.25s -> 3886.57s]  Right.
[3886.57s -> 3886.89s]  Sorry.
[3891.14s -> 3892.50s]  It's just way too loud.
[3892.50s -> 3894.17s]  It can be in the background.
[3894.17s -> 3894.89s]  That's fine.
[3894.89s -> 3895.13s]  All right.
[3895.13s -> 3895.77s]  I need a leaf.
[3896.33s -> 3900.23s]  What color should it be?
[3900.23s -> 3901.51s]  Should it be like maroon?
[3902.23s -> 3903.19s]  Like fall?
[3903.27s -> 3904.23s]  This looks spring to me.
[3904.79s -> 3905.77s]  I think it has to be green.
[3906.33s -> 3915.08s]  Inspiration.
[3915.08s -> 3915.32s]  Okay.
[3915.96s -> 3919.10s]  Or what if I just like...
[3921.02s -> 3921.26s]  All right.
[3921.26s -> 3923.02s]  So it goes like wham, wham, wham.
[3923.66s -> 3924.22s]  Droplet.
[3924.22s -> 3924.94s]  Wham, wham.
[3924.94s -> 3925.26s]  Okay.
[3925.26s -> 3925.98s]  I'm just going to go for it.
[3926.54s -> 3931.05s]  I'm going to go fall colors.
[3931.05s -> 3931.66s]  All right.
[3931.66s -> 3932.38s]  I need one of these things.
[3932.94s -> 3940.84s]  Okay.
[3940.84s -> 3941.80s]  Let's mix these together.
[3942.92s -> 3943.48s]  What?
[3943.48s -> 3946.02s]  I put that on my pants.
[3946.66s -> 3959.14s]  Dude, that's a good one already.
[3959.94s -> 3960.50s]  That's a good one.
[3960.50s -> 3961.14s]  It's like a little guy.
[3962.74s -> 3962.98s]  Okay.
[3963.54s -> 3964.65s]  Here we go.
[3965.29s -> 3966.65s]  Let's see if I can get this to happen.
[3967.21s -> 3968.01s]  Is this clean?
[3976.34s -> 3976.90s]  Okay.
[3976.98s -> 3978.18s]  That's a perfect leaf.
[3979.32s -> 3979.96s]  That's right.
[3980.84s -> 3981.08s]  Okay.
[3981.08s -> 3981.48s]  So it's...
[3984.63s -> 3986.07s]  I don't have to be perfect.
[3986.07s -> 3993.51s]  This is too big of a...
[3994.15s -> 3997.26s]  No, that's not water.
[3997.26s -> 3997.82s]  This is paint.
[3998.38s -> 4005.30s]  Okay.
[4005.30s -> 4005.46s]  All right.
[4005.46s -> 4006.10s]  Here we go.
[4006.10s -> 4008.94s]  Looks like it's a one, two.
[4008.94s -> 4030.07s]  It's like a fucking shitty palm tree.
[4031.05s -> 4031.85s]  No, it's okay.
[4031.85s -> 4033.24s]  It's okay.
[4033.24s -> 4054.30s]  It's okay.
[4054.30s -> 4054.70s]  Shit.
[4054.70s -> 4055.34s]  Hold on.
[4055.34s -> 4062.39s]  I need a spray can.
[4062.39s -> 4062.71s]  Oops.
[4063.35s -> 4074.92s]  Okay.
[4074.92s -> 4075.56s]  Give it to me.
[4075.56s -> 4082.82s]  This would be such a good VR game.
[4082.82s -> 4083.22s]  That's right.
[4083.22s -> 4083.38s]  Okay.
[4083.38s -> 4083.94s]  Hold on.
[4083.94s -> 4092.89s]  I should just did it like this already.
[4092.89s -> 4094.09s]  This is way better.
[4094.09s -> 4125.45s]  I shrink that.
[4125.45s -> 4130.33s]  I need to blend.
[4130.33s -> 4131.13s]  Blend it in a little bit.
[4131.13s -> 4131.69s]  Hold on.
[4131.69s -> 4134.58s]  I need like a blender.
[4134.58s -> 4135.22s]  This thing.
[4135.22s -> 4160.65s]  Or did I?
[4160.65s -> 4161.99s]  Wait a minute.
[4161.99s -> 4162.97s]  No, I didn't.
[4162.97s -> 4163.69s]  Holy shit.
[4163.69s -> 4164.17s]  Holy shit.
[4164.17s -> 4165.05s]  This is awesome.
[4165.05s -> 4166.97s]  This is in the background.
[4166.97s -> 4168.57s]  This is like a beach.
[4168.57s -> 4169.05s]  This is a beach.
[4169.05s -> 4170.09s]  This is a fucking palm tree.
[4170.09s -> 4170.73s]  That's a palm tree.
[4170.73s -> 4171.29s]  The beach.
[4171.29s -> 4172.39s]  This is perfect.
[4172.39s -> 4173.85s]  That's a background.
[4173.85s -> 4174.17s]  That's a tree.
[4174.17s -> 4174.73s]  The beach.
[4174.73s -> 4178.14s]  That's like an animal crossing tree.
[4178.14s -> 4178.38s]  Okay.
[4178.38s -> 4179.02s]  No, that's perfect.
[4179.02s -> 4179.26s]  Okay.
[4179.26s -> 4180.06s]  I'm all right.
[4180.06s -> 4182.86s]  If I go all the way up.
[4182.86s -> 4186.87s]  These guys need eyes.
[4186.87s -> 4193.35s]  Why did you smush caterpillars on the canvas?
[4193.35s -> 4195.70s]  I didn't.
[4195.70s -> 4196.18s]  Hey.
[4196.18s -> 4197.62s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[4197.62s -> 4211.38s]  Grow up.
[4211.38s -> 4211.70s]  Hey.
[4212.34s -> 4214.17s]  I didn't want to shrink his head.
[4214.89s -> 4221.03s]  I want to paint.
[4221.03s -> 4226.36s]  I can't paint on top of that
[4226.36s -> 4227.88s]  because it's technically paint.
[4227.88s -> 4237.16s]  Get over here.
[4237.16s -> 4243.43s]  I killed him.
[4243.43s -> 4244.31s]  I killed him.
[4244.31s -> 4248.62s]  I didn't want that.
[4248.62s -> 4249.26s]  Shit.
[4249.26s -> 4267.59s]  Is that like bat?
[4267.59s -> 4268.79s]  Is that like a squished head?
[4268.79s -> 4273.00s]  Here we go.
[4273.00s -> 4276.90s]  This is just part of their bodies.
[4276.90s -> 4290.36s]  It's pickle Rick.
[4290.36s -> 4294.10s]  I don't hate this so far.
[4294.10s -> 4294.58s]  I actually really...
[4294.58s -> 4295.22s]  What was this one?
[4295.22s -> 4295.86s]  Boredom?
[4295.86s -> 4300.82s]  What should I add?
[4300.82s -> 4301.06s]  Maybe...
[4301.86s -> 4303.03s]  I don't know.
[4303.03s -> 4303.99s]  I kind of like this.
[4303.99s -> 4306.74s]  How's that?
[4306.74s -> 4307.06s]  Awful.
[4307.06s -> 4307.78s]  Looks fine.
[4307.78s -> 4311.51s]  Is it bored?
[4311.51s -> 4314.49s]  I actually like...
[4314.49s -> 4315.21s]  I like this one.
[4316.34s -> 4317.32s]  What's the...
[4317.32s -> 4318.68s]  Look, and we'll go like this too.
[4318.68s -> 4325.32s]  I like this one.
[4325.32s -> 4325.96s]  It's cute.
[4325.96s -> 4328.66s]  I think I want to dress this up a little more.
[4328.66s -> 4330.36s]  Or is it ready?
[4330.36s -> 4331.08s]  What do you think?
[4331.08s -> 4335.38s]  All right.
[4335.38s -> 4336.50s]  Let's see what you guys think.
[4336.50s -> 4341.11s]  It's ready.
[4341.11s -> 4342.63s]  I have a package to get too.
[4342.63s -> 4352.74s]  I love it.
[4352.74s -> 4354.50s]  You guys can give me inspiration.
[4354.50s -> 4355.22s]  6.0.
[4355.22s -> 4356.18s]  Give me a break.
[4356.18s -> 4365.77s]  That's better than the 6.0.
[4365.77s -> 4368.02s]  Oh, it got squished.
[4372.76s -> 4373.48s]  Flip it around.
[4374.79s -> 4376.31s]  Oh, they got squished in.
[4376.31s -> 4376.79s]  Oh, well.
[4385.82s -> 4387.10s]  It's still wet.
[4387.10s -> 4390.10s]  Wait, I can fix it before it goes.
[4390.10s -> 4393.61s]  Let's give a check mark on it.
[4394.49s -> 4402.54s]  Okay.
[4403.34s -> 4403.74s]  Where's my...
[4403.74s -> 4404.70s]  I got a new package.
[4404.70s -> 4407.86s]  Where did I get a package?
[4407.86s -> 4408.66s]  Important.
[4408.66s -> 4409.86s]  Nothing.
[4409.86s -> 4411.48s]  Where's the package?
[4416.71s -> 4417.35s]  What the fuck is this?
[4423.94s -> 4424.82s]  What the hell?
[4426.30s -> 4426.78s]  Small...
[4426.78s -> 4427.74s]  Ready for delivery.
[4430.34s -> 4431.62s]  What's ready for delivery?
[4433.91s -> 4434.47s]  Oh, shit.
[4434.47s -> 4435.35s]  What's going on out here?
[4436.57s -> 4437.13s]  Okay.
[4437.13s -> 4440.17s]  For a second, I thought we were in a moving truck.
[4440.17s -> 4442.36s]  I was like, we're going...
[4442.36s -> 4443.88s]  We're on the highway right now.
[4443.88s -> 4444.92s]  What the hell is going on?
[4445.48s -> 4449.00s]  What's in here?
[4449.00s -> 4453.50s]  Is there anything fragile in this?
[4454.06s -> 4471.77s]  How do I open it?
[4471.77s -> 4472.41s]  Dude.
[4472.41s -> 4477.34s]  This is the best game ever.
[4477.34s -> 4480.18s]  What's this one?
[4480.18s -> 4480.90s]  Hearts?
[4480.90s -> 4486.84s]  You can drag it too?
[4486.84s -> 4500.28s]  What's the last one?
[4500.28s -> 4501.48s]  Oh, god damn it.
[4501.48s -> 4502.12s]  Are you kidding me?
[4502.12s -> 4504.44s]  I could have just done this in the middle of the last one.
[4504.44s -> 4506.54s]  Whatever.
[4506.54s -> 4507.72s]  All right.
[4507.72s -> 4508.84s]  Let's get you guys involved.
[4508.84s -> 4512.22s]  Pick three random challenges to make your life harder.
[4512.22s -> 4513.66s]  The chat will then vote for one of them.
[4513.66s -> 4514.14s]  Don't cheat.
[4514.14s -> 4515.18s]  They're watching you.
[4515.18s -> 4516.12s]  Okay.
[4516.12s -> 4517.88s]  Pick three random art styles for your next painting.
[4517.88s -> 4519.48s]  The chat will then vote for one of them.
[4519.48s -> 4520.90s]  You will fail.
[4520.90s -> 4522.42s]  Perhaps your viewers are merciful.
[4522.42s -> 4525.53s]  Okay.
[4525.53s -> 4526.09s]  How about...
[4526.81s -> 4527.85s]  What do you guys think?
[4527.85s -> 4538.73s]  We aren't merciful?
[4539.29s -> 4540.54s]  Yes, you are.
[4541.18s -> 4546.95s]  Thank you.
[4547.83s -> 4548.71s]  Thank you.
[4548.71s -> 4549.75s]  Thank you very much.
[4550.81s -> 4551.69s]  Thank you very much.
[4551.69s -> 4552.01s]  All right.
[4552.01s -> 4554.95s]  Challenge my style.
[4554.95s -> 4555.51s]  As real...
[4555.51s -> 4556.31s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4556.31s -> 4556.95s]  I canceled this.
[4556.95s -> 4557.67s]  I need more time.
[4557.67s -> 4560.60s]  It's gonna be longer than 15 seconds.
[4560.60s -> 4563.14s]  30 seconds.
[4563.14s -> 4563.46s]  All right.
[4563.46s -> 4565.22s]  Challenge my style.
[4565.22s -> 4571.26s]  Expressionist, Cubist, or Art Nouveau.
[4571.26s -> 4572.86s]  I don't know what the third one is.
[4572.86s -> 4575.10s]  So I have no idea.
[4575.66s -> 4580.07s]  What is a Cubist?
[4580.07s -> 4588.55s]  I'm just gonna interpret that as draw cubes.
[4588.55s -> 4589.11s]  Cubist.
[4594.52s -> 4595.16s]  Okay.
[4595.16s -> 4596.52s]  So it looks like we're gonna go Cubist.
[4598.10s -> 4598.66s]  Sounds good.
[4599.38s -> 4601.22s]  Analyze and cut your subject from different angles.
[4601.22s -> 4602.66s]  Now make those cuts more abstract
[4602.66s -> 4605.30s]  and reassemble them on your painting.
[4605.30s -> 4605.62s]  Okay.
[4605.62s -> 4606.74s]  I'm gonna draw some cubes.
[4606.74s -> 4607.54s]  I don't know.
[4607.54s -> 4608.18s]  Whatever.
[4608.18s -> 4610.09s]  All right.
[4610.09s -> 4610.73s]  Canvas size.
[4610.73s -> 4614.42s]  I want a normal one.
[4614.42s -> 4615.14s]  Oops.
[4615.14s -> 4616.98s]  Throw that one away.
[4616.98s -> 4623.69s]  How do you throw a painting away?
[4623.69s -> 4624.09s]  Thank you.
[4624.09s -> 4624.33s]  What?
[4626.63s -> 4626.95s]  Okay.
[4626.95s -> 4628.15s]  One by...
[4628.15s -> 4628.63s]  Let's do this.
[4628.63s -> 4629.51s]  Let's just small one.
[4629.51s -> 4629.91s]  Perfect.
[4630.47s -> 4640.66s]  There you go.
[4640.66s -> 4641.22s]  Cubist.
[4645.22s -> 4646.90s]  Cubist.
[4646.90s -> 4647.78s]  Cube painting.
[4651.32s -> 4652.44s]  Cube painting.
[4652.44s -> 4653.32s]  A cube painting.
[4654.04s -> 4657.61s]  Interesting.
[4659.54s -> 4660.10s]  Interesting.
[4661.99s -> 4662.63s]  Interesting.
[4666.34s -> 4666.98s]  Interesting.
[4667.62s -> 4674.76s]  Interesting.
[4679.94s -> 4680.58s]  Interesting.
[4681.59s -> 4682.47s]  Very interesting.
[4683.67s -> 4684.55s]  Very interesting.
[4686.17s -> 4686.89s]  Interesting.
[4687.99s -> 4689.03s]  Very interesting.
[4690.84s -> 4692.84s]  Very interesting indeed.
[4692.84s -> 4693.80s]  Very interesting.
[4696.26s -> 4697.30s]  Very interesting.
[4700.10s -> 4701.91s]  Where's my sponge?
[4702.47s -> 4703.43s]  That was very loud.
[4703.43s -> 4703.75s]  Sorry.
[4704.31s -> 4742.74s]  All right.
[4742.74s -> 4743.70s]  Where's the leaf blower?
[4743.70s -> 4745.66s]  Aim this right here.
[4745.66s -> 4755.70s]  Clean that up.
[4755.70s -> 4756.82s]  Aim it directly down.
[4782.52s -> 4784.92s]  I'm getting rid of the play like paintball.
[4784.92s -> 4785.67s]  All right.
[4785.67s -> 4786.79s]  Where is my...
[4786.79s -> 4787.99s]  Where's my leaf blower?
[4787.99s -> 4794.68s]  What is this thing?
[4794.68s -> 4796.04s]  What is this?
[4796.04s -> 4796.76s]  What is this?
[4798.39s -> 4798.71s]  Whoa.
[4799.59s -> 4800.07s]  Holy shit.
[4800.07s -> 4800.47s]  This is...
[4800.47s -> 4800.79s]  Let me...
[4800.79s -> 4801.11s]  Hold on.
[4801.11s -> 4803.08s]  Wait.
[4803.08s -> 4803.80s]  What the fuck?
[4803.80s -> 4804.60s]  This is awesome.
[4804.60s -> 4805.08s]  All right.
[4805.08s -> 4810.17s]  This is like I got like eight brushes on it.
[4810.17s -> 4817.90s]  I want to...
[4817.90s -> 4819.26s]  This is a mop.
[4819.26s -> 4825.51s]  It's a mop.
[4825.51s -> 4826.71s]  It's just a regular mop.
[4826.71s -> 4828.79s]  I thought it was going to be like a bunch of paint brushes.
[4828.79s -> 4831.70s]  For a second, I thought it was clay.
[4831.70s -> 4833.38s]  I could like squeeze clay out of here.
[4833.38s -> 4838.47s]  All right.
[4838.47s -> 4840.71s]  I'll do the satisfying thing when you go like this.
[4840.71s -> 4853.45s]  Keep going.
[4853.45s -> 4862.36s]  Oh.
[4862.36s -> 4863.56s]  This cleaning up the paint.
[4863.56s -> 4864.76s]  I want to do that later.
[4864.76s -> 4865.54s]  I'm not...
[4865.54s -> 4866.26s]  Let's do that later.
[4866.66s -> 4869.40s]  Where's the leaf blower?
[4869.40s -> 4869.96s]  There it is.
[4869.96s -> 4870.28s]  Here we go.
[4870.28s -> 4872.63s]  You ready?
[4872.63s -> 4872.87s]  There.
[4872.87s -> 4874.76s]  Here's Cubist for you.
[4874.76s -> 4900.94s]  Let's go.
[4900.94s -> 4904.20s]  I'm just waiting for the mom to open the door and go,
[4904.20s -> 4906.90s]  Jerry, what are you doing?
[4906.90s -> 4907.46s]  And I turn.
[4907.46s -> 4909.72s]  I've got like lipstick all over my face.
[4909.72s -> 4911.48s]  I've got all of her clothes on.
[4911.48s -> 4916.42s]  I got like a pair of dad's shoes on that are way too big for me.
[4916.42s -> 4920.36s]  They're like eight sizes too big.
[4920.36s -> 4921.24s]  Jerry.
[4921.24s -> 4930.04s]  What is she, mom?
[4930.04s -> 4930.52s]  Cool.
[4930.52s -> 4932.36s]  It made a really cool pattern.
[4932.36s -> 4942.63s]  Look at the pattern it made.
[4942.63s -> 4944.71s]  We need more.
[4944.71s -> 4946.87s]  We need more paint.
[4946.87s -> 4950.06s]  Give me...
[4950.06s -> 4953.21s]  Spin it.
[4953.21s -> 4953.77s]  No.
[4953.77s -> 4959.83s]  I'm not going to spin it because this symbolizes like the insanity.
[4959.83s -> 4965.96s]  And this is me trying to be as stoic and normal as possible
[4965.96s -> 4970.15s]  while the sanity just flows over me.
[4970.15s -> 4974.71s]  Insanity, I mean.
[4974.71s -> 4985.53s]  In a true Cubism fashion, I stand strong while society just goes nuts.
[4985.53s -> 4991.51s]  I try as hard as I can to stay cool and stay strong and stay locked.
[4991.51s -> 4994.39s]  But getting hit by all the crazy shit going on.
[4994.39s -> 5000.73s]  I kind of like what it did to the floor.
[5000.81s -> 5005.26s]  Okay, I got it right when it...
[5005.26s -> 5005.58s]  I got it.
[5005.58s -> 5005.98s]  I got it.
[5005.98s -> 5006.62s]  No, I didn't.
[5006.62s -> 5007.02s]  Fuck.
[5007.02s -> 5007.58s]  It's okay.
[5007.58s -> 5010.36s]  That's the Joker.
[5012.68s -> 5017.22s]  That was just for the Joker.
[5017.22s -> 5018.34s]  I want a bucket of paint.
[5018.34s -> 5019.70s]  I want to spray it everywhere.
[5019.70s -> 5040.62s]  Isn't it fun to make a mess when it doesn't even matter?
[5040.62s -> 5042.46s]  You're pretending this is some profound statement
[5042.46s -> 5048.46s]  when you just don't actually know what Cubism is.
[5048.46s -> 5049.18s]  Oh, it's full.
[5049.18s -> 5059.70s]  Okay.
[5059.70s -> 5060.42s]  Hell yeah.
[5060.42s -> 5063.43s]  It was like, I know what Cubism is.
[5087.29s -> 5089.70s]  We call that an accident.
[5089.70s -> 5091.14s]  That's not a happy accident.
[5091.14s -> 5095.03s]  That is, you've ruined the whole painting.
[5095.03s -> 5096.63s]  Looks like it's red now.
[5098.46s -> 5098.86s]  Okay.
[5099.82s -> 5101.03s]  What do you think?
[5101.03s -> 5102.84s]  Cubism.
[5102.84s -> 5112.54s]  Okay.
[5112.54s -> 5113.50s]  How do I wash the...
[5113.50s -> 5115.74s]  Can I just press a button and have the sprinkler system come on?
[5115.74s -> 5126.63s]  Because that's the only way this is getting clean.
[5126.63s -> 5127.35s]  Zero and ten.
[5127.35s -> 5135.22s]  Therefore, it's a five rate.
[5135.22s -> 5136.50s]  I'm going to put this on the marketplace.
[5136.50s -> 5137.70s]  Let me sign it first.
[5137.70s -> 5157.48s]  It's a Spider-Man popsicle.
[5157.48s -> 5158.04s]  I win.
[5158.04s -> 5159.24s]  Spider-Man popsicle.
[5159.24s -> 5159.56s]  I won.
[5159.56s -> 5159.88s]  I won.
[5159.88s -> 5160.04s]  I won.
[5160.04s -> 5161.16s]  It's a Spider-Man popsicle.
[5161.16s -> 5161.88s]  It's okay.
[5161.88s -> 5174.95s]  It's fixed.
[5174.95s -> 5176.47s]  Marketplace.
[5176.47s -> 5182.31s]  Sell it for 250 hours.
[5182.31s -> 5187.50s]  No, 100 bucks.
[5187.50s -> 5188.06s]  New vote.
[5188.06s -> 5188.62s]  New vote.
[5188.62s -> 5189.10s]  New vote.
[5189.10s -> 5189.50s]  New vote.
[5189.50s -> 5190.14s]  All right, all right, all right.
[5192.18s -> 5195.21s]  Challenge my skills.
[5195.21s -> 5196.25s]  One minute to paint.
[5196.25s -> 5198.49s]  Paint with your eyes closed or one single stroke.
[5202.20s -> 5203.48s]  How am I going to do any of these?
[5204.28s -> 5205.80s]  How am I going to do one minute?
[5208.38s -> 5209.82s]  One single stroke?
[5211.77s -> 5213.37s]  Paint with your eyes closed.
[5213.37s -> 5214.09s]  I don't even...
[5214.09s -> 5214.57s]  I can't...
[5214.57s -> 5217.29s]  How am I supposed to do that without somebody being in the room here?
[5217.29s -> 5218.70s]  I need to put a pair of...
[5218.70s -> 5219.98s]  I need to put clothes on for this.
[5219.98s -> 5220.70s]  Fuck.
[5220.70s -> 5227.22s]  The only reason why you guys are clicking on that is because you want the webcam.
[5229.94s -> 5230.34s]  All right.
[5230.34s -> 5231.06s]  Fine.
[5231.06s -> 5231.94s]  Let me set this up.
[5232.50s -> 5235.80s]  Can I clean the area up first?
[5237.51s -> 5238.31s]  Let me clean up first.
[5238.95s -> 5244.82s]  I got to do a full cleanup.
[5244.82s -> 5246.26s]  This is disgusting.
[5246.26s -> 5248.95s]  I got to...
[5248.95s -> 5249.91s]  It's disgusting.
[5249.91s -> 5251.29s]  Give me a minute.
[5251.29s -> 5254.22s]  I got to organize.
[5254.22s -> 5256.62s]  This is just absolutely fucking revolting.
[5256.62s -> 5257.34s]  Where's the trash?
[5259.90s -> 5266.74s]  Where's the trash can?
[5266.74s -> 5267.78s]  Is this trash?
[5267.78s -> 5268.18s]  Over here?
[5271.42s -> 5271.98s]  I guess so.
[5277.13s -> 5277.53s]  All right.
[5277.53s -> 5279.03s]  Trash.
[5279.03s -> 5280.15s]  He's stalling.
[5280.15s -> 5281.19s]  Yeah, well, whatever.
[5285.45s -> 5286.57s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[5286.57s -> 5287.37s]  Ow, my face.
[5287.93s -> 5288.74s]  I'm really sorry.
[5288.74s -> 5290.14s]  I didn't mean to.
[5290.14s -> 5290.94s]  Don't do that again.
[5291.75s -> 5293.85s]  Okay, I won't.
[5293.85s -> 5304.82s]  Come with me.
[5304.82s -> 5305.78s]  I'm going to put you on the shelf.
[5306.26s -> 5324.73s]  You want your favorite delicious nutrition paste?
[5324.73s -> 5325.23s]  Okay.
[5326.01s -> 5326.33s]  Clean.
[5326.33s -> 5327.45s]  Oh, this looks nice.
[5327.45s -> 5328.57s]  Clean, clean, clean, clean.
[5328.57s -> 5329.45s]  Give me that bucket.
[5329.45s -> 5330.90s]  Move this stuff out of the way.
[5332.18s -> 5333.94s]  Okay, that's what those are.
[5333.94s -> 5335.06s]  I thought there were bugs everywhere.
[5335.06s -> 5336.26s]  All right, give me my trash.
[5336.26s -> 5341.69s]  There's a gift above the water tap.
[5341.69s -> 5344.50s]  How do I get up there?
[5344.50s -> 5357.40s]  What is this?
[5367.66s -> 5368.94s]  Is everyone saying compact?
[5368.94s -> 5373.51s]  Do you understand that this is like 14 feet tall ceilings?
[5373.51s -> 5374.55s]  Okay, open.
[5374.55s -> 5379.91s]  What is it?
[5379.91s -> 5380.31s]  A ball?
[5387.86s -> 5388.66s]  Whoa.
[5388.66s -> 5392.22s]  Can I put paint on it and throw it around?
[5392.22s -> 5398.73s]  Can I cover it in paint?
[5400.02s -> 5426.07s]  Hold on.
[5426.07s -> 5427.03s]  Dip it in a bucket.
[5427.03s -> 5431.91s]  Hold on, let me.
[5431.91s -> 5436.41s]  All right, dip it in a bucket of paint.
[5436.41s -> 5437.21s]  Sure, fill this.
[5437.21s -> 5438.65s]  I'll roll it around here.
[5438.65s -> 5454.14s]  Stalling, stalling.
[5454.14s -> 5455.74s]  I'm playing.
[5455.74s -> 5456.70s]  I'm not stalling.
[5456.70s -> 5457.98s]  This whole game is painting.
[5458.86s -> 5460.30s]  Just chill, okay?
[5460.30s -> 5467.00s]  Chill.
[5467.00s -> 5469.54s]  Don't make me take a break and go eat a piece of beef jerky.
[5469.54s -> 5471.59s]  But I will.
[5471.59s -> 5473.19s]  All right, let's dunk it in the paint.
[5473.19s -> 5473.91s]  Where'd it go?
[5488.57s -> 5490.41s]  Whoa, it rolls down.
[5495.58s -> 5496.38s]  Wow.
[5496.38s -> 5507.19s]  Is there any more fun toys?
[5507.19s -> 5509.64s]  Put a canvas on the floor.
[5509.64s -> 5520.01s]  Yeah, but it's the biggest one I can get.
[5520.01s -> 5521.13s]  One, three.
[5521.13s -> 5524.92s]  One, two.
[5524.92s -> 5527.05s]  One, one.
[5527.05s -> 5528.41s]  No, this is tiny.
[5528.41s -> 5529.05s]  Sell it back.
[5529.05s -> 5534.87s]  Right here.
[5534.87s -> 5538.76s]  One, 13.
[5538.76s -> 5540.84s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5540.84s -> 5541.56s]  Yes.
[5541.56s -> 5542.78s]  Give it to me.
[5542.78s -> 5548.18s]  How do I move this?
[5548.18s -> 5553.43s]  Can I not pick this up?
[5553.43s -> 5562.36s]  Five minutes ago, he said you were going to clean this place up.
[5562.36s -> 5562.76s]  What am I?
[5563.56s -> 5564.79s]  You know, strong enough.
[5564.79s -> 5565.91s]  Hurry and turn the cam on.
[5565.91s -> 5566.95s]  All right, we'll just wait a minute.
[5566.95s -> 5591.37s]  What is this?
[5591.37s -> 5592.73s]  I thought that was my doorbell.
[5592.73s -> 5594.01s]  I was about to freak out.
[5594.01s -> 5620.92s]  I was like, somebody here.
[5620.92s -> 5622.28s]  That's a dick.
[5622.28s -> 5623.48s]  I have to change that.
[5627.34s -> 5628.54s]  I don't know, like this one.
[5628.54s -> 5629.10s]  Whatever.
[5629.10s -> 5639.26s]  Better.
[5639.26s -> 5662.52s]  Okay, good.
[5662.52s -> 5663.16s]  Who?
[5663.24s -> 5664.68s]  Okay, what do we have for customers?
[5664.68s -> 5667.54s]  Offer.
[5667.54s -> 5670.57s]  I'm Scarleth.
[5670.57s -> 5672.17s]  Always stay strong in the face of adversity.
[5672.17s -> 5672.97s]  I'd like a painting from you.
[5672.97s -> 5674.17s]  Something warm.
[5674.17s -> 5675.70s]  Big canvas.
[5675.70s -> 5676.34s]  Thank you.
[5676.34s -> 5677.46s]  This is pure art.
[5677.46s -> 5678.26s]  I'm amazed.
[5678.26s -> 5680.55s]  You're my favorite human artist.
[5680.55s -> 5681.67s]  Stay free.
[5681.67s -> 5682.47s]  I need a painting for you.
[5682.47s -> 5683.67s]  The portrait of a demon.
[5683.67s -> 5684.87s]  In Dada style.
[5684.87s -> 5685.67s]  Don't know what that is.
[5685.67s -> 5686.76s]  Got it.
[5686.76s -> 5687.64s]  Incredible offer.
[5687.64s -> 5689.14s]  Yep.
[5689.14s -> 5690.55s]  All right, well, hold on.
[5690.55s -> 5691.83s]  End of the simulation.
[5691.83s -> 5696.06s]  This is the end of your simulated training program.
[5696.06s -> 5697.90s]  While you can spend more time training your skills here,
[5697.90s -> 5700.14s]  no more virtual clients will try to contact you.
[5700.14s -> 5702.70s]  Hope your natural talent for the art has been further simulated.
[5704.10s -> 5705.14s]  Yet another disappointment.
[5705.14s -> 5706.10s]  Can't wait to have a real studio.
[5706.10s -> 5709.64s]  Equipped with liquid art runs through my veins.
[5709.64s -> 5711.24s]  End of the trial.
[5711.24s -> 5711.72s]  No.
[5711.72s -> 5713.90s]  Let me end it.
[5713.90s -> 5714.54s]  That's not.
[5714.54s -> 5719.29s]  Your painting is on its way to the marketplace.
[5719.29s -> 5720.70s]  Offer.
[5720.70s -> 5721.10s]  You want a...
[5721.10s -> 5721.98s]  Do you want something warm?
[5723.77s -> 5732.20s]  Hey, this kind of looks good.
[5732.76s -> 5748.22s]  Turn the camera on.
[5748.22s -> 5749.66s]  I'm gonna do a camera one.
[5749.66s -> 5750.22s]  Just hold on.
[5750.22s -> 5750.86s]  I have to like...
[5750.86s -> 5753.58s]  Let me take a break and put on a t-shirt.
[5753.58s -> 5764.22s]  Jump into the laser now.
[5764.22s -> 5765.74s]  No, it's probably gonna kill me.
[5765.74s -> 5776.18s]  It's fine.
[5776.18s -> 5776.98s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[5776.98s -> 5778.42s]  Seize get degrees, guys.
[5778.90s -> 5779.70s]  Oops, I just ruined it.
[5779.70s -> 5779.94s]  Whatever.
[5779.94s -> 5780.58s]  I don't care.
[5780.58s -> 5785.70s]  End it.
[5785.70s -> 5789.78s]  Oh, this is not big enough.
[5789.78s -> 5792.65s]  Sell it on the marketplace.
[5792.65s -> 5800.68s]  For 50 bucks.
[5800.68s -> 5802.84s]  SD5 added to the marketplace.
[5809.48s -> 5810.28s]  This looks funny.
[5810.28s -> 5811.29s]  Okay.
[5811.29s -> 5811.61s]  All right.
[5811.61s -> 5812.09s]  Let me...
[5812.09s -> 5812.81s]  I need this.
[5813.45s -> 5814.09s]  I'll do the...
[5814.09s -> 5816.89s]  I closed one on like a decent size canvas over here.
[5816.89s -> 5824.82s]  Well, this is...
[5824.82s -> 5825.38s]  This is fine.
[5833.61s -> 5834.41s]  Right there.
[5834.41s -> 5835.94s]  A little bit higher.
[5835.94s -> 5842.01s]  Close your darn eyeballs.
[5842.01s -> 5842.57s]  I will.
[5842.57s -> 5842.97s]  I'm not gonna...
[5842.97s -> 5844.95s]  I'm just setting it up.
[5844.95s -> 5846.07s]  What's this link?
[5846.07s -> 5848.20s]  It says...
[5849.00s -> 5850.26s]  I don't know.
[5850.26s -> 5854.09s]  I don't know what the hell you just linked me.
[5854.09s -> 5854.89s]  I don't...
[5854.89s -> 5855.77s]  What is this?
[5855.77s -> 5863.74s]  What is this?
[5863.74s -> 5885.11s]  This is from Ferris Bueller's Day Off?
[5885.11s -> 5886.31s]  I don't remember this.
[5886.31s -> 5889.37s]  I don't...
[5889.37s -> 5891.45s]  I don't remember.
[5891.45s -> 5894.42s]  I've seen this movie a few times,
[5894.42s -> 5896.34s]  but it's been a very long time.
[5896.34s -> 5905.40s]  100 million off the debt if you clean the studio
[5905.40s -> 5907.88s]  and keep it clean for the rest of the stream.
[5907.88s -> 5911.46s]  I don't think I can do that.
[5912.62s -> 5914.06s]  Clean the studio.
[5914.06s -> 5916.31s]  Wait, what is this?
[5916.31s -> 5919.34s]  It says 100 million off the debt
[5919.34s -> 5920.54s]  if you clean the studio
[5920.54s -> 5929.16s]  and keep it clean the rest of the stream.
[5929.16s -> 5929.64s]  I can...
[5929.64s -> 5931.78s]  That's not gonna happen.
[5931.78s -> 5932.02s]  All right.
[5932.02s -> 5932.74s]  Let's take a break.
[5932.74s -> 5933.22s]  I'm gonna go pee.
[5933.22s -> 5934.10s]  I'm gonna grab a...
[5934.10s -> 5936.78s]  I'm gonna grab a beef stick.
[5936.86s -> 5938.23s]  And I'll be right back.
[5938.23s -> 5939.43s]  And then I'll make sure I have clothes on.
[5939.43s -> 5940.87s]  I'll turn the face cam on.
[5940.87s -> 5942.71s]  And I will do a...
[5942.71s -> 5943.67s]  I closed one.
[5943.67s -> 5944.28s]  All right.
[5944.28s -> 5945.58s]  I'll be right back.
[5945.58s -> 5946.14s]  Here we go.
[5946.14s -> 6263.42s]  How many catboys?
[6264.47s -> 6264.95s]  I left...
[6265.59s -> 6267.98s]  I left like four or five minutes ago
[6267.98s -> 6269.66s]  with a catboy on camera.
[6269.66s -> 6273.66s]  And I came back and there's a catboy on camera.
[6273.66s -> 6274.46s]  It's like...
[6274.46s -> 6275.98s]  It's just all catboys.
[6279.02s -> 6280.06s]  All catboys.
[6281.00s -> 6283.24s]  It was 90 plus percent catboys.
[6283.24s -> 6284.28s]  Oh my fucking god.
[6284.28s -> 6284.92s]  That's so funny.
[6289.22s -> 6290.74s]  It's only catboy.
[6291.30s -> 6294.41s]  They're holding a gun?
[6294.97s -> 6296.10s]  What is that?
[6297.32s -> 6297.72s]  Oops.
[6297.72s -> 6298.60s]  All catboys.
[6298.60s -> 6299.08s]  Why is...
[6299.08s -> 6299.56s]  Why is this...
[6299.56s -> 6300.52s]  Why is he holding a gun?
[6301.16s -> 6305.16s]  All right.
[6305.16s -> 6309.27s]  Let me get my camera set up.
[6309.27s -> 6309.83s]  One of us.
[6309.83s -> 6310.47s]  One of us.
[6310.47s -> 6311.03s]  What the fuck?
[6311.67s -> 6312.34s]  All right.
[6312.34s -> 6312.58s]  Hold on.
[6312.58s -> 6319.26s]  Let me get my camera set up.
[6319.26s -> 6320.06s]  Out of the way.
[6321.21s -> 6322.01s]  Get this out of the way.
[6322.01s -> 6324.09s]  And I'll close my goddamn eyes.
[6329.91s -> 6330.15s]  Okay.
[6330.79s -> 6333.35s]  Make sure this looks fine.
[6334.07s -> 6336.92s]  I've got a drink here too, by the way.
[6336.92s -> 6337.40s]  Don't...
[6337.40s -> 6338.92s]  Don't get mad at me.
[6338.92s -> 6344.25s]  How am I gonna do this?
[6344.81s -> 6353.42s]  Can you see me?
[6355.06s -> 6355.86s]  Anybody see me?
[6362.18s -> 6363.54s]  Why is my camera fucked up?
[6370.82s -> 6371.30s]  Wait.
[6371.30s -> 6373.30s]  What is this?
[6373.30s -> 6373.78s]  Fuck that.
[6373.78s -> 6374.42s]  Why is it...
[6374.42s -> 6376.73s]  Get out of the way.
[6376.73s -> 6377.13s]  You see?
[6380.10s -> 6381.77s]  Hello?
[6381.77s -> 6388.79s]  You down there?
[6388.79s -> 6401.22s]  Why am I...
[6401.22s -> 6401.54s]  Oh.
[6401.54s -> 6403.91s]  Hold on.
[6403.91s -> 6404.31s]  Oops.
[6414.84s -> 6415.40s]  Oh.
[6415.40s -> 6418.36s]  Gotta get the good side in too.
[6418.36s -> 6418.76s]  We can't...
[6418.76s -> 6420.76s]  We can't just have the bad side.
[6420.76s -> 6428.02s]  Gotta get the good side in there too.
[6428.02s -> 6430.50s]  We can't just have just the bad side.
[6430.50s -> 6440.62s]  I have to keep my eyes closed.
[6440.62s -> 6443.32s]  I'll try it.
[6443.32s -> 6448.98s]  Raid song.
[6448.98s -> 6450.18s]  Family guy raid.
[6450.18s -> 6456.38s]  We got a family guy raid?
[6459.45s -> 6462.90s]  Donkey just came in with a raid?
[6462.90s -> 6463.70s]  What's going on, Donkey?
[6466.44s -> 6467.56s]  What's going on, everybody?
[6467.56s -> 6468.20s]  Welcome.
[6468.20s -> 6471.10s]  I'm just setting up a chat challenge video.
[6471.10s -> 6471.90s]  Family guy?
[6471.90s -> 6473.82s]  Should I sing family guy?
[6473.82s -> 6475.50s]  I'm not gonna do that.
[6475.50s -> 6476.54s]  There's 6,000 new people.
[6476.54s -> 6481.85s]  No way.
[6481.85s -> 6482.33s]  What's up?
[6482.33s -> 6483.29s]  Thanks for the raid.
[6483.29s -> 6484.65s]  This is fucking crazy.
[6486.15s -> 6487.99s]  I've been a fan of Donkey's for years.
[6490.09s -> 6492.12s]  He was one of the YouTubers.
[6492.12s -> 6493.56s]  I'll tell you, the capture video,
[6493.56s -> 6496.23s]  that's one of the best videos on YouTube.
[6496.23s -> 6498.33s]  Like, hands down.
[6498.33s -> 6499.85s]  The capture Donkey video
[6500.41s -> 6503.69s]  is one of the best YouTube videos on YouTube.
[6503.69s -> 6505.98s]  I'm gonna be gushing here for a little bit.
[6505.98s -> 6506.70s]  Sorry.
[6510.15s -> 6511.51s]  So what we're doing right now...
[6511.51s -> 6512.31s]  Thank you again, Donkey.
[6512.31s -> 6513.19s]  Welcome, guys.
[6513.19s -> 6515.43s]  We're doing a art stream.
[6515.43s -> 6517.51s]  And part of it is, as you'll see...
[6517.51s -> 6517.99s]  Hold on.
[6517.99s -> 6518.55s]  Whoa!
[6518.55s -> 6518.87s]  You just...
[6518.87s -> 6520.31s]  Now you can see what I look like with the white.
[6523.43s -> 6524.39s]  Turn that back off!
[6525.42s -> 6525.66s]  Shit!
[6525.66s -> 6526.86s]  With like a real camera?
[6531.98s -> 6533.10s]  Why do I not know how to drink?
[6533.82s -> 6534.78s]  This is not even alcohol.
[6534.78s -> 6535.50s]  I just lied to you.
[6536.71s -> 6537.11s]  Ew!
[6537.11s -> 6538.47s]  He's like ugly now.
[6540.10s -> 6541.62s]  Okay, so the goal here was...
[6543.78s -> 6545.06s]  I got challenged.
[6545.06s -> 6546.01s]  I'm connected.
[6546.01s -> 6546.73s]  Look, look, look.
[6546.73s -> 6547.54s]  Here you go.
[6547.54s -> 6548.90s]  So this is connected to Twitch right now.
[6548.90s -> 6549.70s]  And it's a cool game.
[6549.70s -> 6550.98s]  It's called Art...
[6550.98s -> 6552.20s]  What's the name of the game?
[6553.91s -> 6555.90s]  Such Art.
[6555.90s -> 6558.46s]  It's a game where you just kind of can do whatever you want.
[6558.46s -> 6560.06s]  There's spray cans.
[6560.06s -> 6561.66s]  There's paint brushes.
[6561.66s -> 6562.78s]  It's really fucking cool.
[6563.34s -> 6565.10s]  So we'll see what they do.
[6565.10s -> 6568.22s]  Oh, the challenge, right.
[6568.22s -> 6569.74s]  I have to keep my eyes closed in the next painting.
[6569.74s -> 6570.14s]  But let me get...
[6570.14s -> 6571.58s]  Okay, while you guys do, let me set this up.
[6571.58s -> 6574.04s]  Because this is not ready at all.
[6574.04s -> 6574.92s]  I want...
[6574.92s -> 6576.04s]  What color should I do?
[6576.04s -> 6579.14s]  Let me get this...
[6579.14s -> 6580.10s]  Hold on.
[6580.10s -> 6580.82s]  Right.
[6580.82s -> 6586.41s]  And you can go like this.
[6587.72s -> 6589.08s]  You get this cleaning in the game.
[6589.08s -> 6591.00s]  If you like viscera cleanup detail, you're gonna love it.
[6591.00s -> 6591.80s]  It's free.
[6592.76s -> 6593.72s]  Make sure I say that.
[6593.72s -> 6595.58s]  Get it out of here.
[6595.58s -> 6597.46s]  Free game.
[6597.46s -> 6598.82s]  This is free.
[6598.82s -> 6608.82s]  You want to see the amount of content that's here for free?
[6608.82s -> 6609.70s]  Okay, I need this brush.
[6611.42s -> 6612.22s]  This brush here.
[6614.50s -> 6615.70s]  I need to have a palette.
[6615.70s -> 6618.65s]  Okay, let me get this back over here.
[6619.29s -> 6620.41s]  I need to clean this.
[6621.13s -> 6623.21s]  So if my eyes are gonna be closed, I have to be...
[6623.21s -> 6625.48s]  I gotta be really close.
[6625.48s -> 6626.60s]  So this is gonna go up here.
[6626.60s -> 6630.54s]  I'm gonna clean it like this.
[6631.26s -> 6631.90s]  So if I...
[6631.90s -> 6634.22s]  It's right there.
[6634.78s -> 6635.26s]  So it's...
[6635.26s -> 6636.86s]  How many degrees is that?
[6636.86s -> 6641.66s]  That is burp puked.
[6643.21s -> 6644.17s]  How many degrees is this?
[6647.34s -> 6648.06s]  One, two.
[6649.69s -> 6650.73s]  I took one sip of this.
[6650.73s -> 6652.86s]  It's a ginger beer.
[6652.86s -> 6653.82s]  Oh, you're urinating.
[6653.82s -> 6659.42s]  No, I'm not.
[6659.42s -> 6662.09s]  Okay, so let me clean this.
[6666.54s -> 6669.11s]  Do it. Vomit.
[6669.11s -> 6670.73s]  Shut up.
[6670.73s -> 6674.50s]  Fuck.
[6674.50s -> 6679.50s]  Fuck up.
[6679.50s -> 6683.38s]  What are you writing?
[6683.38s -> 6684.34s]  Mr. Jeremy, sir.
[6684.34s -> 6687.06s]  I'm gonna read it until it gets fucking deleted from the mod.
[6689.67s -> 6690.47s]  Mr. Jeremy, sir.
[6690.47s -> 6691.91s]  I've been to ask this for almost four months now.
[6691.91s -> 6692.55s]  I cannot sleep.
[6692.55s -> 6694.55s]  I stayed for nights going through this thought process
[6694.55s -> 6695.91s]  in my head over and over again.
[6695.91s -> 6697.59s]  My wife cannot even look at me in the eyes anymore
[6697.59s -> 6699.75s]  and she's moved to her mother's house.
[6699.75s -> 6702.31s]  I need to know if you urinate standing up or sitting down.
[6702.31s -> 6703.51s]  I know this is somewhat off limits,
[6703.51s -> 6707.03s]  but this morbid curiosity is ruining my life.
[6708.76s -> 6709.32s]  That's an easy...
[6709.32s -> 6709.96s]  I can answer that.
[6714.01s -> 6715.29s]  If you just go number one, you stand.
[6715.29s -> 6717.13s]  If you go number two, you go number one
[6717.13s -> 6721.24s]  after you go number two while you're sitting.
[6721.24s -> 6722.04s]  Easy.
[6722.04s -> 6728.18s]  That's correct.
[6728.18s -> 6736.31s]  You go number two and you're still sitting there.
[6736.31s -> 6737.59s]  So it's like, all right, might as well do number one too.
[6737.59s -> 6740.38s]  I'm right here.
[6740.38s -> 6741.10s]  That's like a fact.
[6741.74s -> 6743.26s]  If you don't do that, you're a liar.
[6743.26s -> 6749.03s]  So wait, let me get this straight.
[6749.59s -> 6752.95s]  You go shit and then after you shit, you go,
[6752.95s -> 6756.63s]  if you have to pee, you stand up and turn around
[6756.63s -> 6760.54s]  and pee into the toilet.
[6760.54s -> 6765.05s]  Can I understand that one?
[6765.05s -> 6767.13s]  I'm confused.
[6767.13s -> 6769.77s]  You go before, but what if you have to go?
[6772.25s -> 6773.45s]  What if you have to go afterwards?
[6773.45s -> 6774.97s]  What, you're just going to hold it?
[6774.97s -> 6779.02s]  Is that such a big deal to pee while you're sitting down
[6779.02s -> 6780.14s]  for a lot of you guys?
[6780.14s -> 6785.50s]  You just don't go.
[6785.50s -> 6786.00s]  What?
[6790.07s -> 6791.11s]  You just don't go.
[6793.98s -> 6796.42s]  Why?
[6796.42s -> 6797.46s]  Toilet humor stream.
[6797.46s -> 6798.34s]  No, this is not toilet.
[6798.90s -> 6800.98s]  I'm actually curious if you guys are gaslighting or not.
[6802.30s -> 6804.22s]  God, I'm so sick of being gaslit every day.
[6806.58s -> 6806.98s]  What is this?
[6806.98s -> 6810.55s]  Oh, I need that.
[6810.55s -> 6811.91s]  Okay, so what colors do I want?
[6811.91s -> 6817.27s]  I want to do, we'll do like a gray.
[6818.36s -> 6821.67s]  We'll do a yellow.
[6822.55s -> 6823.91s]  Yellow and other yellow.
[6823.91s -> 6829.22s]  Mustard, pink and purple.
[6829.22s -> 6831.02s]  Good.
[6831.02s -> 6832.46s]  Okay, so let's go here.
[6833.10s -> 6846.55s]  I got to remember where these are.
[6846.55s -> 6851.05s]  Okay, so that's purple and pink are on the left side.
[6852.68s -> 6855.48s]  Mustard and yellow are in the middle and blacks on the right.
[6855.48s -> 6862.98s]  Okay, so paintbrush one is here.
[6864.49s -> 6864.97s]  I need paint.
[6864.97s -> 6865.93s]  And this is another slot.
[6866.49s -> 6867.51s]  What just happened?
[6868.76s -> 6870.52s]  Yeah, I don't like the slots these are in.
[6870.52s -> 6874.76s]  I know this is a lot of setup, but bear with me.
[6875.32s -> 6877.50s]  I need water.
[6878.14s -> 6887.88s]  Shirt your pants right now.
[6889.91s -> 6891.59s]  Had to do it.
[6891.59s -> 6893.83s]  The person gave like 500 community subs.
[6893.83s -> 6902.42s]  So this is going to be to my left.
[6902.98s -> 6904.36s]  Oh, come on, dude.
[6904.36s -> 6904.76s]  Really?
[6904.76s -> 6913.56s]  What the fuck?
[6913.56s -> 6914.36s]  Actually did it.
[6914.92s -> 6921.50s]  So this is in.
[6922.38s -> 6922.94s]  That's correct.
[6922.94s -> 6926.78s]  Okay, so if I close my eyes, it's not close enough.
[6926.78s -> 6927.82s]  It's got to be closer.
[6927.82s -> 6933.06s]  Okay, there's the canvas.
[6933.06s -> 6936.44s]  Okay, there it is.
[6937.32s -> 6938.52s]  And then I've got my paints over here.
[6938.52s -> 6939.00s]  Here we go.
[6939.96s -> 6941.00s]  All right, I'm going to start.
[6941.00s -> 6941.80s]  Are you ready?
[6941.80s -> 6944.62s]  I'm going to do...
[6944.62s -> 6945.34s]  Let's just go for it.
[6945.34s -> 6946.70s]  See if I can do something here.
[6946.70s -> 6949.16s]  When do I close my eyes?
[6949.16s -> 6949.80s]  Now?
[6949.80s -> 6953.14s]  Wait, should I close my eyes like...
[6953.78s -> 6955.62s]  Can I open them at all during the whole process?
[6955.62s -> 6956.90s]  How long do I do this for?
[6956.90s -> 6963.96s]  I don't have a time limit.
[6963.96s -> 6965.75s]  I guess until I'm ready.
[6966.31s -> 6968.28s]  Set a timer.
[6968.28s -> 6969.08s]  All right, what's the timer for?
[6969.08s -> 6969.56s]  Five minutes?
[6970.12s -> 6972.01s]  I was at a time for five minutes.
[6972.01s -> 6977.64s]  I just...
[6977.64s -> 6978.76s]  Okay, I almost just...
[6978.76s -> 6980.20s]  I almost just locked out my phone.
[6980.92s -> 6982.84s]  I just did the password wrong like five times.
[6982.84s -> 6984.04s]  I just deleted my whole phone.
[6985.48s -> 6986.52s]  Jesus Christ.
[6986.52s -> 6988.97s]  Okay, let's do...
[6993.51s -> 6993.91s]  Timer.
[6996.38s -> 6998.06s]  My alarms are so fucked up.
[6999.18s -> 7002.54s]  My alarms right now, I have one for 7 a.m., 8.30 a.m.,
[7002.54s -> 7006.02s]  and then 1.30 p.m.
[7006.02s -> 7007.22s]  After 8.30, it's kind of just like...
[7007.22s -> 7007.94s]  Apparently, it's just like...
[7007.94s -> 7008.82s]  I guess fuck it.
[7008.82s -> 7012.23s]  I'm just going to stay asleep.
[7012.23s -> 7014.42s]  Okay, timer.
[7014.42s -> 7018.09s]  Five minutes on the clock.
[7018.09s -> 7019.19s]  Ready?
[7019.19s -> 7026.38s]  Three, two, one, go!
[7026.38s -> 7027.26s]  Oh, wait.
[7027.26s -> 7034.09s]  I want the thick...
[7034.09s -> 7034.97s]  Okay, one and two.
[7034.97s -> 7035.45s]  Is this one?
[7036.09s -> 7042.58s]  Do I have paint on?
[7042.58s -> 7043.62s]  I don't even know if I have paint on.
[7045.77s -> 7046.73s]  I think there's paint on this.
[7053.24s -> 7058.14s]  I don't even know where I'm standing.
[7058.14s -> 7066.76s]  I don't know where I'm standing.
[7066.76s -> 7067.56s]  I heard something.
[7072.34s -> 7073.22s]  Where's the paint?
[7073.78s -> 7081.59s]  I don't know where I am.
[7081.59s -> 7091.83s]  I gotta find the water bucket.
[7091.83s -> 7092.95s]  I think I'm on the...
[7092.95s -> 7093.75s]  I hear it.
[7093.75s -> 7100.63s]  I don't know where the bucket is.
[7100.63s -> 7102.31s]  I really have no idea where the bucket is.
[7102.31s -> 7106.17s]  Did I move?
[7106.17s -> 7111.86s]  Fuck it.
[7111.86s -> 7113.05s]  On the bucket.
[7113.05s -> 7117.29s]  That means here's the canvas, which means here's the paint.
[7117.29s -> 7137.42s]  I have no idea what's happening.
[7137.58s -> 7168.31s]  Is this the bucket of water?
[7168.31s -> 7182.36s]  I don't know what the you grabbed paint sound is.
[7182.36s -> 7183.48s]  Where's escape?
[7183.48s -> 7185.88s]  Okay, this tilde is one.
[7185.88s -> 7192.86s]  I hear like the...
[7192.86s -> 7205.32s]  How long is it?
[7205.32s -> 7206.52s]  It's been five minutes yet.
[7206.52s -> 7219.32s]  I think I did something wrong.
[7219.32s -> 7221.27s]  I think I just clicked something.
[7228.62s -> 7229.42s]  I don't know where the bucket is.
[7229.42s -> 7234.63s]  I gotta find the bucket again.
[7234.63s -> 7235.35s]  That's the bucket.
[7235.35s -> 7238.39s]  That's the water bucket.
[7238.39s -> 7240.70s]  So then this is the canvas.
[7240.70s -> 7245.74s]  So then this is the fucking palette.
[7245.74s -> 7247.26s]  Is this the palette to the right?
[7249.91s -> 7251.51s]  Why is it making painting sounds?
[7251.51s -> 7266.63s]  How much time is left?
[7269.94s -> 7271.38s]  Is my phone on silent?
[7271.38s -> 7271.70s]  Can I...
[7271.70s -> 7272.26s]  Wait, hold on.
[7272.90s -> 7275.48s]  Can I look at the phone to make sure it's not on silent?
[7275.48s -> 7277.29s]  If I go like this, hold on.
[7277.29s -> 7279.50s]  How long has it been?
[7279.50s -> 7285.19s]  Can I look?
[7285.19s -> 7286.42s]  Can I look at the phone?
[7287.06s -> 7287.38s]  Please?
[7287.94s -> 7291.24s]  I don't even know what you're saying.
[7297.66s -> 7298.54s]  I'm painting something.
[7298.54s -> 7299.18s]  It could be the ground.
[7299.18s -> 7299.66s]  It could be a wall.
[7299.66s -> 7300.22s]  I don't know.
[7300.22s -> 7304.01s]  Where's my drink?
[7304.01s -> 7307.26s]  This is the stupidest thing ever.
[7307.26s -> 7316.22s]  Why would I like just blindly reach for a drink?
[7316.22s -> 7317.82s]  Why is that so hard to do that with my eyes closed?
[7317.82s -> 7319.58s]  It's not like that my muscle memory changes.
[7320.22s -> 7321.02s]  Do I need to see?
[7321.98s -> 7327.59s]  Holy shit, I did it.
[7327.59s -> 7331.19s]  Stop.
[7331.19s -> 7331.83s]  Shut the fuck up.
[7336.78s -> 7337.98s]  I actually did it.
[7337.98s -> 7346.15s]  What happened over here?
[7346.15s -> 7356.73s]  How long has it been like that?
[7356.73s -> 7360.17s]  I haven't had paint for like probably a long time.
[7360.17s -> 7360.97s]  The whole time.
[7360.97s -> 7361.85s]  Well, how did I get this?
[7362.65s -> 7363.90s]  All right, here you go.
[7364.54s -> 7367.21s]  What do you think?
[7367.21s -> 7382.81s]  I disconnected.
[7382.81s -> 7388.39s]  I'm in.
[7388.39s -> 7390.49s]  Let's see what's going on here.
[7390.49s -> 7401.72s]  Game's not centered.
[7401.72s -> 7404.42s]  It really isn't.
[7404.42s -> 7407.66s]  How long has that been like that for?
[7411.38s -> 7412.82s]  I think this is broken.
[7412.82s -> 7414.68s]  Yeah, this is fucked up.
[7414.68s -> 7420.90s]  I'm going to disconnect and try to reconnect.
[7420.90s -> 7421.70s]  Where's my mouse?
[7421.70s -> 7423.64s]  What the fuck is going on?
[7423.64s -> 7428.60s]  Where's the mouse?
[7428.60s -> 7435.13s]  All right, disconnect.
[7435.13s -> 7437.77s]  Disconnect.
[7437.77s -> 7439.82s]  Try it again.
[7439.82s -> 7441.46s]  Connect.
[7443.05s -> 7443.93s]  This has just worked.
[7446.68s -> 7448.60s]  Well, I'm going to say it was a 10.
[7448.60s -> 7459.85s]  I'm going to restart it.
[7459.85s -> 7461.80s]  Can I save the game like this?
[7461.80s -> 7465.56s]  Do a straw poll instead.
[7465.56s -> 7473.38s]  It's probably for the best that we can't rate this one.
[7473.38s -> 7479.34s]  All right, now let me do that.
[7479.34s -> 7480.14s]  All right, here we go.
[7480.14s -> 7481.58s]  I want to do the Bob Ross thing.
[7481.58s -> 7492.86s]  I'm going to take a picture of this.
[7492.86s -> 7497.08s]  It was a pog out of 10.
[7497.08s -> 7498.68s]  All right, what's a good one to do?
[7498.68s -> 7501.42s]  What's a good one that's not going to get me DMCA claimed?
[7501.42s -> 7505.48s]  Does he have like a YouTube channel?
[7505.48s -> 7511.85s]  I need a new canvas, first of all, and I'm going to sell this.
[7511.85s -> 7523.90s]  I'm selling this for 200, 150.
[7523.90s -> 7527.51s]  He's on Twitch right now.
[7527.51s -> 7529.27s]  Just co-stream the one on Twitch.
[7529.27s -> 7530.79s]  But I have to catch up, don't I?
[7530.79s -> 7536.33s]  There's a Bob Ross right now on Twitch.
[7536.33s -> 7537.37s]  I have to catch up.
[7537.37s -> 7538.49s]  I'm not prepared for that.
[7538.49s -> 7539.29s]  He just started.
[7539.29s -> 7540.41s]  Did he just start?
[7540.41s -> 7554.94s]  What happened to the top?
[7554.94s -> 7557.74s]  Where's the top?
[7558.30s -> 7562.92s]  What happened to the top?
[7563.48s -> 7566.79s]  Wasn't there a top to this?
[7567.43s -> 7567.91s]  Where'd it go?
[7568.63s -> 7571.05s]  Wasn't this sitting on top of this?
[7577.78s -> 7578.66s]  Yikes.
[7578.66s -> 7581.69s]  Jesus.
[7582.25s -> 7593.85s]  Holy shit, that was bad.
[7593.85s -> 7597.08s]  Okay, I got to get a Bob Ross.
[7597.72s -> 7599.08s]  I'm going to co-stream Bob Ross.
[7599.08s -> 7602.63s]  I'm going to do what he's doing on Twitch.
[7602.71s -> 7604.60s]  What's the link?
[7604.60s -> 7618.65s]  Bob Ross, there it is.
[7618.65s -> 7619.53s]  I can do this, right?
[7620.09s -> 7621.40s]  I can do this, right?
[7621.40s -> 7622.36s]  I can do this.
[7622.36s -> 7631.10s]  I can do this, right?
[7631.10s -> 7631.82s]  I can do this.
[7632.38s -> 7635.53s]  I think so.
[7636.09s -> 7638.66s]  All right, let's go.
[7638.66s -> 7641.32s]  I'm going to turn the music down here.
[7641.32s -> 7645.05s]  I got to hurry up because he's going already.
[7645.05s -> 7646.65s]  I got to catch up if I can.
[7646.65s -> 7651.85s]  If it's streaming, then yeah.
[7651.85s -> 7653.37s]  Isn't that the whole point of Bob Ross?
[7657.21s -> 7657.69s]  I guess.
[7657.69s -> 7659.93s]  I guess, I mean, this is like cool, I guess.
[7659.93s -> 7660.41s]  Hopefully.
[7663.51s -> 7665.43s]  Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN.
[7666.55s -> 7667.91s]  Okay, what do we got?
[7672.17s -> 7674.57s]  Disney, Hulu, and ESPN.
[7674.57s -> 7679.19s]  I think the sketchy website I bought this turtle from.
[7680.15s -> 7681.59s]  I didn't buy a turtle.
[7683.72s -> 7684.52s]  Get that up here.
[7685.69s -> 7686.57s]  Make this full screen.
[7686.57s -> 7687.29s]  Give me one sec.
[7690.33s -> 7691.86s]  Okay, can you see it?
[7692.50s -> 7694.86s]  Shit, okay.
[7694.86s -> 7695.66s]  Wait, I can't hear it.
[7697.37s -> 7697.93s]  I can't hear it.
[7697.93s -> 7698.41s]  I can't hear it.
[7705.45s -> 7708.33s]  He's already has a full fucking mountain.
[7708.33s -> 7709.93s]  I'm not going to be able to catch up to this.
[7714.28s -> 7715.56s]  He's got a beautiful mountain.
[7716.20s -> 7725.13s]  He just started this.
[7725.13s -> 7725.61s]  That's it.
[7738.30s -> 7739.02s]  What is it, blue?
[7743.99s -> 7749.06s]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[7749.06s -> 7753.22s]  Blue, white, and this thing too.
[7753.22s -> 7753.46s]  White.
[7753.46s -> 7754.02s]  Where's white?
[7755.75s -> 7757.83s]  Blue, white, and gray.
[7757.83s -> 7758.07s]  Go.
[7758.63s -> 7760.68s]  Doesn't matter.
[7760.68s -> 7761.16s]  I just need it.
[7773.37s -> 7776.26s]  YouTube link.
[7776.26s -> 7777.38s]  You need a brown too.
[7778.81s -> 7779.77s]  Just YouTube it.
[7779.77s -> 7780.01s]  Fuck.
[7780.65s -> 7781.29s]  Give me, give me.
[7781.29s -> 7782.09s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7782.09s -> 7782.41s]  Stop that.
[7782.41s -> 7782.89s]  All right, give me.
[7782.89s -> 7785.34s]  Where's the better one?
[7785.34s -> 7786.30s]  Please, please, please.
[7786.30s -> 7787.66s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[7787.66s -> 7788.78s]  Use YouTube, use YouTube.
[7788.78s -> 7790.06s]  This better not be a fucking screamer.
[7790.06s -> 7790.70s]  I swear to God.
[7790.70s -> 7791.58s]  I will let it stream if it is.
[7795.42s -> 7797.82s]  Not a screamer, but like, fuck you regardless still.
[7807.86s -> 7809.54s]  Did you just link me like your channel?
[7820.23s -> 7820.87s]  All right, how about this?
[7820.87s -> 7821.67s]  How about this?
[7821.67s -> 7822.63s]  We'll do the next one.
[7822.63s -> 7823.35s]  We'll do the next one.
[7823.35s -> 7824.31s]  We'll do the next one here.
[7824.31s -> 7826.07s]  I don't want, I want to catch it.
[7826.07s -> 7832.89s]  This is Otto's Big Adventure 2.
[7836.42s -> 7836.74s]  Great.
[7837.30s -> 7838.66s]  Do you understand how hard this is going to be
[7838.66s -> 7840.50s]  to get somebody to give me a real video?
[7840.50s -> 7841.46s]  We have to wait for the next one.
[7842.58s -> 7851.88s]  I guess I could just find it myself.
[7852.60s -> 7855.46s]  Bob Ross.
[7856.02s -> 7861.13s]  Okay, Bob Ross follow along painting.
[7861.13s -> 7863.66s]  This one is called
[7864.06s -> 7870.58s]  in the midst of winter.
[7870.58s -> 7872.65s]  In the midst of winter.
[7872.65s -> 7877.72s]  This is the right one.
[7877.72s -> 7879.32s]  No, I'm going to do in the midst of winter.
[7879.32s -> 7882.55s]  I really hope I can do this.
[7895.82s -> 7897.50s]  In the middle of winter is this one.
[7897.50s -> 7905.34s]  Good grammar and spelling are important.
[7906.06s -> 7906.78s]  Not anymore.
[7906.78s -> 7908.30s]  You can just type it into this grammar thing
[7908.30s -> 7910.14s]  and just it corrects literally every mistake
[7910.14s -> 7910.62s]  you've ever made.
[7912.15s -> 7913.35s]  You can just fucking just who cares.
[7913.35s -> 7915.43s]  Just mash your goddamn keyboard like a fucking piano.
[7915.99s -> 7916.55s]  Doesn't matter.
[7916.55s -> 7918.15s]  Send your emails will all get fixed.
[7920.50s -> 7923.38s]  Okay, let's get this in the same spot.
[7925.29s -> 7927.21s]  It undermines the writer's message
[7927.21s -> 7928.57s]  and the word choice is bland.
[7938.49s -> 7939.05s]  Okay, here we go.
[7939.05s -> 7940.41s]  Glad to see you today.
[7940.41s -> 7942.50s]  Tell you what, let's get right on today
[7942.50s -> 7944.42s]  and have them run all the colors across the screen
[7944.42s -> 7946.26s]  that you need to paint along with us at home.
[7946.82s -> 7948.42s]  While they're doing that, as usual,
[7948.42s -> 7949.62s]  let me show you what I have.
[7949.62s -> 7950.10s]  What do I need?
[7950.10s -> 7952.18s]  Today I have my standard old pre-stretched
[7952.18s -> 7953.62s]  double primed canvas
[7953.62s -> 7955.62s]  and I've just covered it with a very thin coat
[7955.62s -> 7956.42s]  of liquid white.
[7956.42s -> 7957.06s]  That's all.
[7957.06s -> 7958.18s]  It's wet and ready to go.
[7958.18s -> 7960.10s]  So I thought today maybe we would do
[7960.82s -> 7962.10s]  let's do a little winter scene.
[7962.10s -> 7964.41s]  Something that's let's just see what happens.
[7964.41s -> 7966.17s]  Let's start with with black.
[7966.17s -> 7966.97s]  Potato blue.
[7966.97s -> 7967.77s]  Or blue and black.
[7968.41s -> 7968.65s]  What?
[7968.65s -> 7969.77s]  Just sort of mixing together.
[7969.77s -> 7971.13s]  Black and blue and blue and black.
[7971.13s -> 7972.57s]  Black and blue and blue and black.
[7972.57s -> 7974.81s]  I thought we'd just play a little bit today.
[7974.81s -> 7976.57s]  I don't even have my paints here
[7976.57s -> 7978.01s]  and I hope it is wherever you're at.
[7979.64s -> 7980.92s]  Just have a good time with this.
[7981.88s -> 7986.89s]  We're just we'll just pop in a little sky here and there.
[7988.09s -> 7989.37s]  Something about like so.
[7991.30s -> 7993.70s]  I'm leaving some spots open intentionally.
[7995.14s -> 7996.58s]  Just little spots.
[7996.58s -> 7998.74s]  I don't want this to be a flat old dead sky.
[7999.46s -> 8000.66s]  I wanted to have some life.
[8000.66s -> 8001.62s]  Some action to it.
[8002.66s -> 8003.14s]  Shoot.
[8004.10s -> 8005.54s]  Maybe we can get a little crazy here.
[8007.46s -> 8008.74s]  I've got several of these brushes.
[8008.74s -> 8009.86s]  Mine just doesn't do that.
[8009.86s -> 8010.26s]  Another one.
[8010.26s -> 8011.46s]  Put a little touch.
[8011.46s -> 8013.08s]  Not much.
[8013.72s -> 8014.36s]  Little touch.
[8014.36s -> 8014.92s]  What color?
[8014.92s -> 8016.04s]  Of alizarin crimson.
[8017.40s -> 8018.28s]  I think that's on the ground.
[8020.09s -> 8022.33s]  Just so it's not too bleak.
[8022.89s -> 8026.57s]  Sometimes winter scenes can be very very depressing.
[8027.29s -> 8030.18s]  Put just a little pink in there.
[8030.18s -> 8033.13s]  Just to give it a little warmth in the background.
[8033.93s -> 8035.19s]  This looks like shit.
[8035.19s -> 8035.91s]  I need my masher.
[8035.91s -> 8038.63s]  I still want to have a distinct winter taste to it.
[8038.63s -> 8044.01s]  Play some of that right down to the edge of that pink.
[8046.90s -> 8048.42s]  And that's basically all it takes.
[8049.06s -> 8049.46s]  Is it?
[8049.46s -> 8050.10s]  I did it.
[8050.10s -> 8055.19s]  There a little bit and that's good enough.
[8055.19s -> 8058.15s]  That'll give us the sky that as I say it has a little life in it.
[8058.15s -> 8059.27s]  Some actions happening.
[8059.27s -> 8061.03s]  It's not just a flat old dead sky.
[8061.03s -> 8064.23s]  You can see light areas and I like that in the sky.
[8065.19s -> 8067.00s]  Shoot that's working pretty good.
[8067.72s -> 8069.08s]  Maybe we'll do the same thing down here.
[8070.36s -> 8070.60s]  Shit.
[8072.71s -> 8074.95s]  Anything that we don't use.
[8076.63s -> 8078.23s]  I should have done this in the beginning.
[8078.23s -> 8080.71s]  If this is a winter scene maybe we'll have some snow.
[8080.71s -> 8082.31s]  You've got to have shadows in the snow.
[8083.19s -> 8084.79s]  Or maybe it'll turn out to be water.
[8085.59s -> 8087.03s]  Who knows?
[8087.03s -> 8088.15s]  It doesn't matter.
[8088.15s -> 8088.87s]  I'm doing pretty well.
[8088.87s -> 8089.75s]  It doesn't matter.
[8089.75s -> 8092.52s]  We can fix anything that can happen here.
[8092.52s -> 8095.88s]  We don't concern ourselves with mistakes.
[8095.88s -> 8097.08s]  We just have happier mistakes.
[8097.08s -> 8099.00s]  What a fucking unbelievable person.
[8099.00s -> 8100.20s]  I love this guy.
[8100.52s -> 8101.40s]  Bob Ross is incredible.
[8103.62s -> 8104.98s]  What a fucking joy of a human.
[8104.98s -> 8105.54s]  You know what I mean?
[8105.54s -> 8105.94s]  Seriously.
[8107.22s -> 8108.34s]  I should have done this more often.
[8108.34s -> 8110.50s]  I should do this like every fucking week.
[8110.50s -> 8111.14s]  This feels good.
[8119.34s -> 8119.98s]  It looks okay.
[8120.79s -> 8121.11s]  I don't know.
[8121.11s -> 8122.39s]  It's a little too much in the middle.
[8124.50s -> 8124.90s]  Oh wait.
[8136.28s -> 8140.31s]  Black, Prussian blue, a little patch of crimson.
[8140.95s -> 8142.23s]  A patch of crimson.
[8142.23s -> 8142.63s]  Blue.
[8142.63s -> 8143.03s]  Crimson.
[8143.03s -> 8145.27s]  A little crimson and I'm going to get some white.
[8145.27s -> 8145.59s]  White.
[8146.47s -> 8148.92s]  Just take a little bit of white.
[8148.92s -> 8149.72s]  Okay.
[8149.72s -> 8151.59s]  Mix up.
[8151.59s -> 8153.64s]  Put a little more blue in there.
[8153.64s -> 8154.28s]  A little more blue.
[8154.28s -> 8155.00s]  Yeah.
[8155.00s -> 8155.48s]  Yeah.
[8155.48s -> 8157.48s]  I want it to have sort of a blue cast to it.
[8158.12s -> 8158.76s]  That's good.
[8158.76s -> 8159.80s]  Oh, I like it.
[8159.80s -> 8162.30s]  That's a good looking color.
[8162.30s -> 8162.54s]  Okay.
[8162.54s -> 8163.18s]  Yeah.
[8163.18s -> 8165.66s]  You just mix it until it gets to the flavor you like.
[8165.66s -> 8166.46s]  My flavor is...
[8167.90s -> 8169.69s]  It's sort of a drab.
[8169.69s -> 8171.77s]  Real bright.
[8171.77s -> 8173.93s]  Too much white?
[8174.33s -> 8182.62s]  Please old fanbrush today!
[8182.62s -> 8183.42s]  Yo look still...
[8183.42s -> 8192.33s]  See this color is not...
[8192.33s -> 8193.13s]  Wrong.
[8193.13s -> 8193.45s]  Wrong.
[8193.45s -> 8193.93s]  Wrong!
[8193.93s -> 8194.17s]  Wrong!
[8194.17s -> 8194.81s]  Where's my paintbrush?
[8194.81s -> 8195.05s]  Wrong.
[8196.01s -> 8197.05s]  Where's my paintbrush?
[8197.05s -> 8197.61s]  Wrong.
[8197.61s -> 8197.69s]  Wrong!
[8197.69s -> 8198.33s]  Where's the paintbrush?
[8198.33s -> 8198.97s]  Wrong.
[8198.97s -> 8199.45s]  Where's the brush?
[8199.45s -> 8200.09s]  Where is it?
[8200.09s -> 8200.96s]  Where's the brush?
[8201.67s -> 8202.55s]  Where's my paintbrush?
[8204.25s -> 8205.69s]  Where is my paintbrush?
[8205.69s -> 8208.44s]  Where's my fucking paintbrush?
[8208.44s -> 8209.32s]  Pretty close.
[8209.32s -> 8211.61s]  I'm going to pause this.
[8215.43s -> 8218.18s]  Maybe it has a nice winter color.
[8218.18s -> 8218.82s]  Okay.
[8218.82s -> 8219.46s]  Pursed.
[8219.46s -> 8226.66s]  Where's my paintbrush?
[8226.66s -> 8230.90s]  Okay.
[8230.90s -> 8231.22s]  All right.
[8232.15s -> 8232.79s]  Good.
[8232.79s -> 8247.67s]  so that needs to be this a little more crimson a little more blue a little more gray a little more
[8247.67s -> 8257.14s]  white i think we're there i think we're there here we go on pause i need black okay yeah black too
[8257.14s -> 8274.71s]  squish this down here black okay how's that look that's very wintery i think i got it a little
[8274.71s -> 8280.39s]  more there we go that's it that's the one right there that's it i got it that's the one i'm good
[8280.47s -> 8290.57s]  let's go let's grab an old brush an old brush full of color where's it going
[8292.78s -> 8300.20s]  maybe in our world back here i don't know where it's going somewhere see this color is not
[8300.20s -> 8310.50s]  but it's already on the canvas let's push upward today and make us a little tree it's pretty close
[8310.50s -> 8323.62s]  to the color it's on the canvas and that's what we're looking for i don't want it too much right
[8323.62s -> 8329.77s]  there and you decide how many trees live in your world it's up to you totally well i only did one
[8330.49s -> 8336.62s]  as you've probably heard me say before to me that's what's so fantastic about painting
[8337.34s -> 8341.54s]  is that each and every person will paint differently and that's what makes it special
[8342.10s -> 8347.14s]  if we all painted the same way what a boring time it would be see yeah that's right you would know
[8347.14s -> 8352.10s]  what the finished painting was going to be before you start that's right he's right because people
[8352.10s -> 8359.67s]  are different paintings are different it's the beauty of it it really is makes it very special
[8359.67s -> 8372.58s]  allows you to to show your individuality the trees do we want here it's up to you you decide
[8372.58s -> 8380.47s]  you decide maybe like five you just want a few maybe just a little baby one right there
[8380.47s -> 8385.69s]  he's not so big yet make up little stories you know people look at you like you're a little
[8385.69s -> 8391.69s]  strange but that's all right painters are expected to be different i love bob ross
[8391.69s -> 8403.94s]  it's trees i thought i don't have a real paintbrush
[8407.53s -> 8411.85s]  what the fuck is that thing i've missed down here at the base of this
[8412.41s -> 8418.58s]  yes so just by tapping we're just going to softly softly disappear over here
[8419.30s -> 8423.83s]  we used to just sort of look like we're just sitting in a little misty area
[8424.79s -> 8442.44s]  just breathing in the cold air i fixed it very misty cold looking and already you had the
[8442.44s -> 8450.02s]  impression of winter mine looks like a forest of burnt down this doesn't look like clean
[8455.74s -> 8465.21s]  now the paint snow with a two inch brush very easy loaded full of color which is white and we have
[8465.21s -> 8472.14s]  we already have this gray color on the canvas we put on and talked about it being shadow now
[8472.14s -> 8478.06s]  it's gonna pick that up see there we just let it sort of disappear over here we don't care
[8480.23s -> 8490.22s]  fuck wrong way that easy fantastic why are you doing that snow is one of the easier things to
[8490.22s -> 8499.51s]  paint in this technique okay you ready for a little a little fun today maybe tell you what
[8499.51s -> 8503.75s]  we filmed the show in indiana and there's a there's a lot of old barns here that just
[8504.63s -> 8508.71s]  let's paint an old barn today barn in there one of the easiest ways is to take
[8509.43s -> 8515.35s]  scrapes out of basic shape just where's my scraping tool where's my scraper exact and
[8515.35s -> 8521.58s]  you're not where's the fucking scraper committed here i'm actually using this the whole time
[8521.58s -> 8532.84s]  decide what comes down like yeah it has a place over here for the cow to sleep you decide barns
[8532.84s -> 8539.13s]  come in all kinds of shapes where's the scraper farmers are like painters they they do it their
[8540.04s -> 8548.66s]  way wait stop stop stop stop pause it that's so great about being a fantastic
[8548.66s -> 8556.70s]  that looks so good okay pause it where's the scraper can somebody help me out here where's
[8556.70s -> 8581.21s]  the scraper behind you on the table where is it this is a dora moment i don't know where it is i
[8581.21s -> 8591.70s]  threw it a long time ago i've whipped it across the room a very long time ago and this place is
[8591.70s -> 8602.06s]  filthy so i have no idea where the scraper is here is it you're throwing for views i don't know
[8602.06s -> 8626.25s]  where the scraping tool is does anybody see the scraping tool does this work it's under the
[8626.25s -> 8633.90s]  elevator wait see what do you mean under the elevator what the fuck am i going to do this
[8633.90s -> 8663.69s]  little scraping tool it's near the spoon i just saw it big canvas left corner i don't think it's
[8663.69s -> 8678.76s]  even still here can i get another one i looked right at it did i under the lift you mean under
[8678.76s -> 8688.89s]  this there it is all right i got my scraping tool i'm good all right bob what are we doing
[8689.45s -> 8697.96s]  let's do it snow is one of the easier things to paint in this technique okay you ready for a
[8697.96s -> 8704.20s]  little a little fun today let's go tell you what we filmed the show in indiana and there's a
[8704.20s -> 8710.26s]  there's a lot of old barns here that just fascinate me let's paint an old barn today one of the
[8710.26s -> 8716.90s]  easiest ways is to take a scrape out a basic shape just sort of scrape it out it doesn't have to be
[8717.86s -> 8725.59s]  and you're not committed you're not committed here so let's just decide what kind of old barn
[8725.59s -> 8731.99s]  we want maybe it comes down like that maybe it has a place over here for the cow to sleep
[8733.27s -> 8741.22s]  it doesn't matter you decide this is just a figured tree all right i made it a perspective
[8741.62s -> 8764.57s]  their way great about being a fantastic country sorry the other side about the same distance here
[8766.34s -> 8771.67s]  but just scrape out i hope you can see there's just a basic basic that thing sucks and as i
[8771.67s -> 8776.87s]  mentioned earlier you are not committed bandak brown dark sienna you can change your mind at
[8776.87s -> 8785.40s]  this point a little roll of paint now let's begin picking out the little thing there's the the back
[8786.04s -> 8787.00s]  i didn't paint it
[8824.06s -> 8848.94s]  me too i do that i do i got that's take let's take let's take some white arc sienna
[8851.61s -> 8858.31s]  uh a little band i can i wasn't done a little crimson too what the heck uh give it a little
[8858.31s -> 8866.23s]  warm feeling don't over mix the paint off a little roll of paint then we can go up in here
[8866.23s -> 8872.15s]  shit and just barely touch just let it graze see let it graze looks like old old wood
[8872.95s -> 8878.71s]  if you painted barns and cabins and stuff what happened here what happened to mine
[8879.75s -> 8888.84s]  antique glass for example when you get my age you have a tendency to like
[8889.64s -> 8897.61s]  you can relate to them i need a thinner brush it's this it's not going to work it's not going to
[8897.61s -> 8908.46s]  work let's take a little bandage whether it's darker on the side because maybe not as much
[8908.46s -> 8916.25s]  light is going to hit over here see that's much darker now that some boards in there for that
[8916.25s -> 8920.89s]  we'll just take some bandag brown i need a thicker brush but i need a thinner brush it's too thin but
[8920.89s -> 8931.37s]  it's too thick raid song what what happened who raided another fucking monster raid who raided
[8931.37s -> 8943.94s]  i came to see what's up coney thanks for the raid welcome everybody shit low to you what's
[8943.94s -> 8954.14s]  going on coney coney am i saying this wrong i'm saying this wrong oh my god i'm such a shithead
[8959.78s -> 8965.99s]  i got it i got it i got it well thank you welcome guys today we're uh we you get a nice straight
[8965.99s -> 8969.67s]  edge i guess i don't even do i have to explain what's happening i mean i think this is very
[8969.67s -> 8974.07s]  clear that i'm just this is just a complete bogus this is not working well uh but thanks
[8974.07s -> 8979.54s]  to the very welcome guys hope you had a good stream if what happened there's no paint on this
[8979.54s -> 9003.80s]  this actually looks not this just looks off this it's very bad this is very bad happy accidents
[9004.44s -> 9011.06s]  well what happens when they're all accidents what happens if you only have accidents so you have a
[9011.06s -> 9021.13s]  nice straight edge i need purple there and i need white up here straight edge this looks like an old
[9021.13s -> 9025.29s]  book this is like an old shitty tomb that you found in like your grandfather's attic
[9026.17s -> 9029.34s]  there's like a bunch of spells in this i i don't know what to do about this
[9029.90s -> 9036.34s]  but you can just move it anyway that you i fucked up this angle i don't know how all right we need
[9036.34s -> 9042.54s]  a door oh cal's gotta have a way to get in and out there let's take some bandage decide where
[9042.54s -> 9048.90s]  your door lives and once again don't worry about the bottom we're gonna do we're gonna do a barn
[9049.46s -> 9058.39s]  as i mentioned earlier okay uh wherever we wanted to be i need a door which is about time to do now
[9058.39s -> 9070.62s]  let's say the old barn take too much cutting on that but sometimes i paint that's that's that's
[9070.62s -> 9088.33s]  salad fingers house that's who that's who lives there okay um what do i do now wait he's little
[9088.33s -> 9109.35s]  like uh speckles down here on it on the snow you know what they say about it i gotta pat it over
[9109.35s -> 9119.50s]  here on the other side we'll just bring it when in doubt just like mush this fucking thing down
[9119.50s -> 9127.62s]  and it looks kind of like you did it on purpose snow is so easy to paint i actually don't like
[9127.62s -> 9141.08s]  this so this actually i don't this doesn't look that bad actually now i look at it gotta have a
[9141.08s -> 9151.77s]  big big what's he doing very very helpful most is important is having what is having easel that
[9151.77s -> 9159.35s]  holds your paint you're okay you're painting you're gonna cough your sneeze you really need
[9159.35s -> 9166.52s]  you all right okay you're okay you're just going like he's supposed to like sneeze or cough
[9167.40s -> 9178.66s]  you're good he's okay missed it what happened little crimson little crimson in there what he
[9178.66s -> 9191.96s]  just do maybe right here when you paint just a little bit pretty soon you begin to get a feel
[9191.96s -> 9196.52s]  for it when it touches if it don't want to pull just right then you can add a little that's not
[9196.52s -> 9204.52s]  lightning i just knew the paint wasn't going to cover us unless i did i guess it got be darker
[9204.68s -> 9211.48s]  have a happy little tree he lives right there darker little guy darker on the side the barn
[9211.48s -> 9225.02s]  go the other side over here you know me here we go bigger tree big old tree so much fun to make
[9225.02s -> 9231.29s]  they're very simple very simple takes a little practice like everything else everything in your
[9231.29s -> 9236.71s]  life takes a little practice and mine looks pretty good this technique faster than any painting
[9236.71s -> 9244.90s]  technique that i have ever seen fuck out of the way i think i've tried just about all of them wells
[9244.90s -> 9253.99s]  are so forgiving what am i what am i painting with acrylic i know what that is i think that's
[9253.99s -> 9265.06s]  why the old masters painted mostly in oils they just have a richness mediums to me are very flat
[9265.06s -> 9275.19s]  when they're dry and they're harder this is the easiest because it's very forgiving you can't
[9275.19s -> 9282.86s]  make a mistake here all right let's take let's take some of that nice gray color we had
[9284.41s -> 9288.01s]  this don't look half bad now there's a bunch of trees that covering all the shitty things i did
[9288.01s -> 9309.42s]  maybe there's a little just work way out here oh shit when in doubt mash it on our little ever
[9309.42s -> 9330.95s]  drink titanium white i changed the blue i've been using titanium white liquid white and titanium
[9330.95s -> 9345.98s]  blue whatever that was this is a blue spruce i just made a decision command level decision
[9345.98s -> 9362.23s]  right here that looks really really good not mine but his omega l command focus on your face what
[9362.87s -> 9369.96s]  to decide which trees in the foreground make the small one here is so you do the one
[9369.96s -> 9383.58s]  what oh my god what actually good what is good and did a little tree over here
[9383.58s -> 9401.38s]  somebody just made this this is this is good that's pretty good that's really good nice job
[9403.48s -> 9454.25s]  is the other you need to click then click this link what the fuck not edited oh my fucking god
[9469.08s -> 9507.03s]  hmm okay let's go keep going i only got like five minutes left oh it's like saw it don't take it
[9507.03s -> 9539.13s]  off it's nice and frosty titanium white this is gonna ruin it yep winter seems a lot it
[9539.13s -> 9547.85s]  might be the easiest ones to do fucking hell yeah what do you got here and we just blend that a
[9547.85s -> 9555.51s]  little bit until it looks nice and soft all right let's go in this little tree over here
[9556.98s -> 9563.21s]  i'm intentionally grabbing some of that dark color see we'll put him up on a little hill
[9564.25s -> 9569.05s]  that easy that's not gonna be white right he sort of sits up high isn't that neat but just
[9569.05s -> 9575.00s]  by pulling some of that color that you can create that illusion believable to have this kind of
[9575.00s -> 9596.94s]  power it's a blustery day you just decide like that i like it right there right there my path
[9596.94s -> 9613.64s]  is fine you can just go back and this until it gets just what we consider perfect for the roof
[9613.64s -> 9620.34s]  and sometimes it's nice to just pop in a little duder here what do you say open in one
[9629.08s -> 9635.00s]  you decide you decide where they are but you have little patches of bushes and sticks and wigs
[9636.23s -> 9645.75s]  limbs and twigs that go everywhere what is the same brush ready to get crazy let's take some
[9645.75s -> 9651.37s]  van dyke brown and i brown mostly van dyke brown mostly van dyke brown do i have van dyke brown
[9651.93s -> 9656.73s]  i don't have brown brown does not a color here what is this we're gonna make it
[9657.77s -> 9666.70s]  all right we're gonna make van dyke brown is that van dyke brown is this van dyke brown okay let's
[9666.70s -> 9681.75s]  give him a friend let's give him a friend maybe this is an old birch tree it lives out here it's
[9681.75s -> 9702.30s]  up to you oh why did that fucking happen i got actually visibly mad about that this is the 31st
[9702.30s -> 9717.10s]  series of the joy of painting good gosh holy shit that looks so good for this long been doing this
[9717.42s -> 9723.26s]  now for years i need white i need white i need white white white white white
[9723.26s -> 9729.42s]  and you've made me feel special to enlighten into your home and to let me be part of your family
[9729.42s -> 9736.36s]  i could do it if you hadn't got to see all the shows in your area you would like to
[9737.00s -> 9743.94s]  give your station a call they're available to them they're available to them or if you want to see
[9743.94s -> 9751.64s]  some of them over again it's the only way they know the brown but paint them here i'm just gonna
[9751.64s -> 9758.52s]  put on some little lambs it's too cold for there to be any leaves on here they went they went to
[9758.52s -> 9768.97s]  florida oh shit this leaf there's a good thing i didn't hold it over there i need to add limbs
[9768.97s -> 9775.54s]  where's the what i do with my paintbrush where's the fucking paintbrush where's the

[9820.63s -> 9827.21s]  object game give a break that was a hidden object game okay let's go back he wants to do limbs on
[9827.21s -> 9859.88s]  here with the titanium uh titanium brown wherever it is oh just rascal a little stick right in there
[9859.88s -> 9867.37s]  maybe let's go right over in here maybe over in here we can put the indication of just
[9868.09s -> 9876.49s]  a few little twigs and sticks and things that are living everywhere i can shoot i think with
[9876.49s -> 9881.62s]  that we've done haven't finished painting let's take a little bread and we'll sign this rascal
[9881.62s -> 9886.66s]  i really hope you've enjoyed this little painting i hope you'll try it it'll give you a lot of
