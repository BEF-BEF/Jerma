[18.87s -> 35.64s]  How's it going? How we doing? We doing good? He's early. Yeah, I am early. I am- I'm very early. I
[35.64s -> 48.36s]  am at least four minutes early today. Very interesting. I could- I could be way earlier
[48.36s -> 58.23s]  too, couldn't I? I could have showed up at 3.50. You know, I saw the messages. It's always late.
[58.87s -> 69.83s]  It's always delaying. But you know what? Not today. There is a lot of stuff to talk about today.
[71.96s -> 79.66s]  Let's start. The first thing that we're going to talk about is Katamari Damacy. I'm going to
[79.66s -> 88.98s]  be finishing it today. We love Katamari. We love Katamari. I was going to do some beanies,
[88.98s -> 101.98s]  but pre-stream chose differently. That's what it is. Why are you doing this? You could be eating a
[101.98s -> 110.10s]  big bowl of soup right now. I think soup is probably the worst stream snack. I don't think
[110.10s -> 117.27s]  that works very well. Imagine some streamer is eating a bowl of fucking soup in the middle
[117.59s -> 139.43s]  and soup does not work. You ever have a bread bowl? Yeah, they're amazing. Bread bowl and
[140.47s -> 147.78s]  broccoli cheddar soup. Pretty good. Yeah, we have a lot of stuff going on today. So we're
[147.78s -> 156.90s]  going to do Katamari. Finish Katamari. And later, Final Fantasy 16 sponsor segment for the demo.
[157.62s -> 166.44s]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We'll do that after. We're going to finish Katamari
[166.44s -> 176.42s]  before we do that. We're not going to jump right into that. Hashtag ad. That's right.
[182.33s -> 191.30s]  Do you like Final Fantasy? I have not played a Final Fantasy in probably 10 years, but this one
[192.10s -> 202.82s]  caught my attention because it's action combat. I think the last time I played Final Fantasy
[202.82s -> 212.52s]  I was probably, I don't know, maybe Final Fantasy 4? Final Fantasy 5? But it's kind of like DMC.
[213.08s -> 222.90s]  Really? Interesting. Can you play something else? I don't want to be spoiled on Katamari.
[223.54s -> 239.61s]  It's all good. Katamari is fine. What about TF2? Yeah, that's the idea. Eventually maybe
[239.61s -> 244.89s]  play some Man vs Machine. Let me clarify the record here for a lot of people that probably
[244.89s -> 249.13s]  were expecting. Like I said the words TF2 and I think a lot of people were like,
[249.13s -> 257.37s]  he's going to play TF2 again. Hold on. I don't know. I think I want to play Man vs Machine.
[257.93s -> 261.05s]  I don't know if I want to. I don't know what's going to happen with that.
[261.77s -> 270.44s]  So it's just an idea. He confirmed it. What about Peggle? You know we're playing Peggle.
[270.44s -> 280.04s]  Just not Peggle 2. We're playing the original one. What about Zoombinis?
[281.43s -> 288.76s]  Well, Zoombinis is the next game we're playing. The next game we're playing.
[289.24s -> 302.79s]  So here's how it's going to play out. Katamari Debassi today. Final Fantasy 16 sponsor segment
[302.79s -> 313.74s]  today. Zoombinis. Another day. Like in the next few days. After Zoombinis. Sorcery. Lined up.
[314.38s -> 325.78s]  Sorcery. I told you we were doing it on the 24th but I lied. We're actually doing it. No,
[325.78s -> 333.06s]  we're probably still doing it on the 24th. Somewhere in the middle of that. There's more
[333.06s -> 349.43s]  shit to do. Something else. Dress that time you did a wet fart? Um, nah. It happens. It's all right.
[350.07s -> 369.85s]  When are you going to play Skyrim? Okay, this is not the game request hour. We're just going
[369.85s -> 373.37s]  over the schedule for the next, like the things that I want to do for the next week or two.
[373.93s -> 382.50s]  Remember, what about the something else? Oh, what about the something else? Yeah, there was
[382.50s -> 391.35s]  something else too. Forget what it was. What was it? I don't remember. Is there something else?
[392.73s -> 398.36s]  Stalling? No, not really. Just chilling. Just waiting for people to come in. Because we're
[398.36s -> 406.23s]  going to play Katamari. Oh, and something else. Not, no, I don't think I'm ever going to play
[406.23s -> 414.97s]  Yakuza. I'm really sorry everybody, but I don't think that's going to happen. It's been so long.
[414.97s -> 419.03s]  What's the, you guys have been watching, some of you guys have been watching for years.
[419.75s -> 427.19s]  What is the period where if we cross that period, there's no way I will do it. No way.
[428.46s -> 434.25s]  Let's say I play something and a certain amount of time goes by and I have never gone back.
[434.81s -> 453.08s]  A few days? Really? A few days? No, it's got to be like a week. Really? Yeah, it's at least
[453.08s -> 461.35s]  a couple of weeks. I know. I just move on so quickly. I really do. It's been nine months
[461.35s -> 471.70s]  since you played Sorcery. Yeah. Open up Street Fighter real quick then. Yeah. Are you done
[471.70s -> 476.26s]  with Breath of the Wild? It's been a few weeks. Oh shit. You're right. It actually has been a
[476.26s -> 499.86s]  few weeks. Who cares? Who cares? Yakuza zero one the rumble. It is owed as an extra stream. Yeah,
[499.86s -> 513.26s]  it's not fair. It's genuinely completely fucking unfair. I do have something I want to talk about
[513.26s -> 521.77s]  though. This is the something else. The something else is what I'm about to tell you. So I've been
[521.77s -> 529.51s]  stalling as of right now. Are you ready for a major, major fucking announcement?
[530.23s -> 539.38s]  This is a major announcement. Okay, here we go. He's going for it. He's going for it.
[541.90s -> 550.57s]  As of today, I am now the official chief creative officer of off brand. Let's go.
[551.74s -> 561.80s]  Oh shit. That was kind of loud. Chief creative officer for off brand. If you don't know what
[561.80s -> 567.00s]  off brand is, this is good news. This is really good news. This is great news. I don't know why
[567.00s -> 577.77s]  people, why are people expecting bad news? Off brand. If you know Ludwig, Ludwig started a company.
[578.33s -> 584.82s]  I want to say a year ago now or so. We've been talking back and forth. It's been a long time
[584.82s -> 597.29s]  in the making. No, I'm not pregnant. So I think I want to, let's just talk real quickly about this
[597.85s -> 603.67s]  because, oh shit, I'm still on my like starting soon screen. Oh fuck. Oh God. Hold on.
[604.31s -> 609.54s]  Over the last couple of years, I think a lot of you guys have, you know, I didn't even set up my
[609.54s -> 613.86s]  webcam. Oh no, this is not good. It's all right. Whatever. It's all good. I'll just turn this off.
[615.19s -> 621.75s]  It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Here. Well, I'll give you something else to look at.
[621.75s -> 626.42s]  There you go. Okay. There's like birds in the background and shit. Okay. Here we go.
[626.42s -> 631.18s]  So I want to say like two or three years ago, we talked a lot on this stream about where I
[631.18s -> 635.88s]  wanted to be in the future. And this is all kind of real talk right now. I don't want to,
[635.88s -> 640.98s]  um, little jokes aside, I want to kind of get real for a little bit. I want to say two or three
[640.98s -> 647.77s]  years ago, I talked on stream. I want to say over the course of three or four months about I want
[647.77s -> 655.99s]  to do shows. I want to make stuff and I want to help people make shit too. And I floated the idea
[655.99s -> 661.53s]  around of like after streaming, right? Like what did I want to do when I was done streaming? And
[661.53s -> 665.16s]  some of that, you know, I remember talking to some of you guys in the community being like,
[665.16s -> 671.56s]  hey, what if I helped people make shows? What if I got, I try to be in a company and be a creative
[671.56s -> 677.62s]  director or a creative consultant or something like that. And I was approached by off-brand
[677.62s -> 683.80s]  to do that very thing. So I am insanely excited to work with the off-brand team, the off-brand
[683.80s -> 691.29s]  productions team with obviously with Ludwig, with stands, with, uh, there's all kinds of people
[691.29s -> 704.54s]  in this company now. He's doing his career voice. Let me tell you what this is not. Oh shit. It's
[704.54s -> 708.30s]  no, no, no, no. Okay. So I know that I knew that a lot of people are going to be saying that. So
[708.30s -> 717.62s]  let me, let's address it. Let's address it. Company Andy, company Andy. Okay. The streams going forward.
[717.62s -> 721.30s]  I'm not done streaming by the way. I don't know where you're getting that from. I never told you
[721.30s -> 736.04s]  that. I'm still here. I ain't going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. No. Yeah. Still here. But I
[736.04s -> 743.86s]  think my focus is going to be obviously I'm going to be splitting time and I want to spend a bunch
[743.86s -> 747.78s]  of time with off-brand because there's a lot of shows to do. There's a lot of things that I really
[747.78s -> 756.57s]  want to bring to the table. Do you have a speech ready? This is the speech. Uh, streams are going
[756.57s -> 762.22s]  to operate pretty much as normally. I don't think there's going to be a pretty major change, at least
[762.22s -> 768.98s]  right now. I mean, there's always a but, right? I definitely want to spend a lot of time on the
[768.98s -> 776.66s]  project that they're going to be putting me on. So I am very, very excited. I, uh, I've been,
[776.66s -> 781.75s]  do you understand how hard it's been to not tell you guys this? I think off-brand was going to
[781.75s -> 786.47s]  fucking strangle me, but I, there's been so many times where I'm like, Oh, when I tell everyone,
[786.55s -> 804.30s]  can I tell people this? They grow up so fast. No, no, no, no. So what this means is there's going
[804.30s -> 809.10s]  to be a lot of things that you're going to see that comes from off-brand that I will have had
[809.10s -> 814.66s]  a hand in. If you saw the Ranboo show, Ranboo show was not part of off-brand. I'm just giving
[814.66s -> 822.20s]  an example. That was a little bit of this already kind of working with Ranboo and talking to him
[822.20s -> 824.84s]  and being like, what do you want? What's your vision? What do you want to do for this scene?
[824.84s -> 830.90s]  And for this part of the show, whatever, breaking down scenes and writing stuff and helping with
[830.90s -> 836.62s]  creative direction, I am so fortunate and so happy to be able to say that that's what I'm
[836.62s -> 843.16s]  going to be able to do. Now I didn't have that huge of involvement in Ranboo show, but I, you know,
[843.16s -> 847.24s]  I was consulting on a few things, but now as a creative officer and a creative director,
[847.24s -> 858.52s]  whatever you want to call it, I'm going to be involved in almost everything that off-brand does.
[858.52s -> 864.09s]  And it's great because they're all awesome. I get along really, really well with Ludwig, of course,
[864.09s -> 875.30s]  obviously, with all the rest of the off-brand group. I'm going to cry. No, don't do it. Don't
[875.30s -> 882.52s]  cry. You're going to, I'm telling you right now, you better not start crying. I'm fine. I'm so glad
[882.52s -> 891.13s]  the fucking webcam isn't on. Now I'm excited. This is going to be really cool. We'll see how it goes.
[891.13s -> 906.36s]  Do a face cam sobbing stream. Yeah. So, hey, when you see that off-brand is working on something
[907.61s -> 915.14s]  in the future. Yeah, this is official. I got to retweet it too. And this is all still very new.
[915.14s -> 920.10s]  So obviously there's still a lot that has to happen with I got to get completely onboarded
[920.10s -> 924.10s]  into the company. We have a lot of meetings to do before it's like I actually start working on
[924.10s -> 937.13s]  something. So we're in the very early stages, but it is official. So let's just keep doing what we
[937.13s -> 944.42s]  were doing. I guess the only thing that you guys really need to know in the future is I am going
[944.42s -> 950.17s]  to continue to stream and I'm going to continue to stream kind of when I want to and when I feel
[950.17s -> 957.37s]  like it. And when I think it's going to be a fun thing. Now, let me reiterate what that means.
[957.37s -> 964.55s]  That could mean anything. That could mean five days in a row. That could mean once in a week.
[964.55s -> 969.27s]  That could mean, I mean, think about when the Elden Ring DLC comes out. You're talking about
[969.27s -> 978.30s]  literally that's going to be all day every day. But I do have to make it really clear that I
[979.82s -> 988.60s]  have a job now. He still hasn't tweeted about his card game, by the way. I've got a few tweets
[988.60s -> 994.55s]  I've got to make. All right. I've got a few tweets. Oh, this motherfucker went corporate already.
[996.60s -> 1008.28s]  But yeah, you're not going to see that much of a difference. I'm just telling you, I am an employee
[1008.28s -> 1017.82s]  of a company now and I have duties that I have to do. So this is not, I'm still here. We're obviously
[1017.82s -> 1027.10s]  streaming right now. We're obviously streaming. I'm not going anywhere. I don't plan on it either.
[1027.10s -> 1034.42s]  Keep it real. I'm keeping it real. Yeah, I'm keeping it real right now. You better watch what
[1034.42s -> 1042.73s]  you say now on stream. No, no, no, no, it's fine. Look, I'll prove it to you. I just announced that
[1042.73s -> 1048.22s]  and I'll just say a bunch of bad words, right? So then you know that this is like not changing
[1048.22s -> 1057.80s]  anything. Poopoo penis poopoo. See, it's fine. I still have a job. Wait, I just got something.
[1057.80s -> 1072.33s]  Where's this from? Off brand corporate, was it? Whatever. Now, I don't want to give you guys,
[1073.93s -> 1081.34s]  I'm insanely excited. I cannot wait to get started on projects and I hope I do a good job.
[1081.34s -> 1084.94s]  I hope I actually do a good job. That's what I really want to do. I really want to work with
[1084.94s -> 1089.58s]  creators and streamers, YouTubers, whoever that wants to do something that will come through off
[1089.58s -> 1096.44s]  brand and we'll talk and we'll develop it. I'm going to do my best. Hopefully I can make everybody,
[1097.98s -> 1101.74s]  especially everybody here that's been watching the shows and watching the stuff that I've been
[1101.74s -> 1107.48s]  doing for so long. I just hope that you like the stuff that I do over there too, because I'm going
[1107.48s -> 1111.64s]  to put the same effort, the same time. I'm going to put as much as I can into each one of these
[1111.64s -> 1124.78s]  things. Let's play Katamari. What's the process going to be like working for off brand? Well,
[1124.78s -> 1134.87s]  that's a good question considering today's my first day. So, okay. What do we do? I was going
[1134.87s -> 1140.22s]  to walk into the office with a cup of coffee in my hands and be like, all right guys, what do we do?
[1140.22s -> 1146.36s]  What do I do? What do you want me to do? I'm going to have a whiteboard. I'm going to just
[1146.36s -> 1155.64s]  pull off the top of the whiteboard pen with my teeth to be like, all right, I got an idea.
[1155.64s -> 1160.17s]  We got you. We're going to get you up on a podium. You're going to be given a presidential
[1160.17s -> 1163.77s]  presidential speech. That's where it starts. I'm going to write presidential speech, right?
[1163.77s -> 1167.11s]  And I'm going to go bullet by bullet, right? Bullet line to bullet line.
[1173.93s -> 1182.20s]  Fuck, I have to retweet that. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I know I don't want to repeat myself
[1182.20s -> 1185.80s]  that much, but the whole studio seems like it's going to be a really, really great venture.
[1186.95s -> 1195.43s]  Let's go ahead and retweet this because come on, look at that. Chief creative officer. Come on, Ma.
[1195.43s -> 1205.90s]  Hey Ma, I got a job. Hey Ma, I got a job. Oh yes, it only took him until he was 40.
[1205.90s -> 1219.08s]  It only took him until he was 40. But yeah, let's just keep going. That's the news. That's the thing
[1219.08s -> 1229.13s]  I've been wanting to share for a little while. It's shocking. I haven't told you it yet. This
[1229.13s -> 1236.89s]  feels like a milestone. I think it kind of is for me because I mean, we do make the 40 year old joke,
[1236.89s -> 1242.09s]  but I think there's still a lot of stuff I really want to do. And there's a lot of things that I
[1242.09s -> 1249.18s]  really have left, I think, to say. No, I'm not quitting streaming. I know a lot of people think
[1249.18s -> 1263.06s]  that's what this is. That's not what this is. Welcome to the workforce. It's the job that you
[1263.06s -> 1268.04s]  said you always wanted. I think that's the most important thing to take away from this. This is
[1269.08s -> 1272.28s]  like I told you a couple of years ago, I've talked about it. This is the thing that I really wanted
[1272.28s -> 1279.42s]  to do and I hope I do a good job. And if it is, if it goes the way that I think it's going to go,
[1279.42s -> 1289.21s]  then I'm ready to work. The job is chief creative officer at off brand. Those of you that are just
[1289.21s -> 1304.22s]  trickling in that didn't hear or didn't see the tweet. White collar, white collar Andy. Yeah.
[1304.22s -> 1310.12s]  Are you going to move? I don't, I, I don't, I don't know. All these things have to be taken
[1310.12s -> 1314.41s]  into consideration eventually in the future. I don't know. I'm just going to take it really
[1314.41s -> 1328.68s]  one step at a time. Wait, he's the chief, he's the chief creative officer. That's right. He's the
[1328.76s -> 1346.09s]  chief. No, I like Vegas though. I think I'll probably stick around for a while. Let me turn
[1346.09s -> 1366.58s]  up the chief Elvertson. All right. Hello, honey. You're so floating. You make it look easy.
[1366.58s -> 1373.99s]  Flying is actually hard work, isn't it? But roll up clouds. We thought this was about flying. When
[1373.99s -> 1379.83s]  did we finish talking? Like you can even roll up clouds. I want to be like the king when I grow up.
[1380.78s -> 1385.69s]  My gosh. Don't give up. Clouds can be rolled up. No doubt. Of course they can.
[1386.41s -> 1398.87s]  Come to think of it, we did in Katamari Damassi. Crew chief Elvertson. Are you still going to do
[1398.87s -> 1404.23s]  your own event streams? Yeah. Stuff. I, I know I, I want to make sure I've, I'm a broken record
[1404.23s -> 1411.45s]  on this, but I want to make sure I'm very clear. Me working for off brand and being a position at
[1411.45s -> 1417.06s]  off brand does not mean that I will not do anything anymore. That is not what that means.
[1417.86s -> 1423.48s]  It just means that I'm going to be spending a lot of time working on shows with off brand.
[1423.48s -> 1427.24s]  A lot of those shows that I would want to do too, will probably just be with off brand.
[1427.24s -> 1436.97s]  Of course they will. Right? So it's, it's mainly a, I have another set of duties to do that are not
[1436.97s -> 1446.65s]  just streaming. That's what this announcement is about. All right. We have way. I'm already this
[1446.65s -> 1465.38s]  big. He said duty. I did. Why did I have to scream let's go after I announced it? I just like,
[1465.38s -> 1472.74s]  I was like nervous. The one like clippable moment of like, I am chief creative officer for off
[1472.74s -> 1485.24s]  brand. Let's go. What the fuck? God damn it. Oh, I'm all the way up here. Let's go. Great.
[1486.12s -> 1497.80s]  Wait, how, how do I pick up anything? Oh, I see. Are you going to star in some off brand
[1497.80s -> 1505.42s]  shows or will you be mainly behind the scenes? It really depends on what it is. I just want
[1505.42s -> 1525.06s]  to participate. I can't pick anything up. I only have three clouds total. Which ones can I pick up
[1525.06s -> 1535.74s]  and not pick up? I'm going to know what the fuck is going on right now. Oh, it's these little,
[1535.74s -> 1553.06s]  little ones. Hey, dude, you're going to watch the golden Knights game tomorrow. Yep. Looking
[1553.06s -> 1571.62s]  for the sweep. Can I go fast up here? All right. I might have to redo this one. It's not going to
[1571.62s -> 1590.10s]  be a sweep. Yeah, it's all right. Here we go. Wait, get this guy. One thing. Let me check one
[1590.10s -> 1604.07s]  thing real quick. Sure. I didn't miss anything here. Okay. Good. I haven't even grown at all.
[1606.84s -> 1637.22s]  Oh yeah. I had to check my work email. Where are the clouds? I get, wait, cousin. Work email is a
[1637.22s -> 1646.74s]  weird way for you to pronounce solitaire. I don't even know how to play solitaire.
[1647.38s -> 1653.64s]  All right. So let me just correct that. I don't understand how solitaire works. And anytime
[1653.64s -> 1657.88s]  somebody tries to explain to me solitaire, I just stopped paying attention after the first 10 seconds
[1658.76s -> 1677.82s]  because it's just like, I don't, I don't even care. This was pretty bad. It's all right. It's
[1677.82s -> 1690.81s]  not even 200 clouds. This is an embarrassment. Chief creative officer of off brand Kansas
[1690.81s -> 1699.46s]  and not have to have a display like this. You know what I'm saying? I have at least 250.
[1708.07s -> 1711.67s]  I was thinking about, I didn't want to be like a weirdo about it or anything, but I was thinking
[1711.67s -> 1716.07s]  about going live and just being like, oh yeah, chief creative officer for off brand and just be
[1716.07s -> 1721.69s]  wicked mean for the whole stream. And then you'd be like, uh, yeah, uh, you're talking to the chief
[1721.69s -> 1725.18s]  creative officer of off brand. Like, do you know what the fuck you've been talking about?
[1725.18s -> 1730.87s]  And just have it just be like a nightmare. All right. That's all right. We're just getting started.
[1733.82s -> 1753.29s]  That would not go well. That's how your normal streams are. Massive ego. I'll move the cursor. I
[1753.29s -> 1763.66s]  got it. 60% possibility of rain. There's no Katamari Damacy without fans. Well, let's roll
[1763.66s -> 1776.60s]  up more clouds. All right. That was pretty 57%. It's not good. Should we add chief creative officer
[1776.60s -> 1783.40s]  at off brand to the stream tags? Yeah. Yeah. That sounds pretty good to me. Yeah, definitely.
[1783.40s -> 1794.86s]  A hundred percent. I like that a lot. Who would ever type that in to the search on Twitch?
[1796.54s -> 1803.34s]  Okay. Twitch show me streams of chief creative officers of off brand. Oh, there's only one. Oh,
[1803.34s -> 1818.73s]  okay. Do they know that you only have a 98.5 IQ? Yeah. Hey, they didn't hire me because I'm smart.
[1819.45s -> 1830.89s]  Maybe they did. Who said clearly? All right. Whoever said clearly timed them out. I made a
[1830.89s -> 1843.08s]  little joke and they said clearly and I want them timed out for five minutes. You're creative officer,
[1843.08s -> 1860.44s]  not intelligent officer. Chief creator of shitting pants. That would probably get more hits on the
[1860.44s -> 1871.90s]  tag on Twitch than that one. Let's do who's new. Are you new? Who's new? You're new. Nice to meet
[1871.90s -> 1877.54s]  you, your highness. Katamari Damacy is really fun making stars. That's so cool. So I kind of ended
[1877.54s -> 1883.38s]  up, I missed it. I can't get the, I really want to see a new Saturn that fits this ring just right.
[1883.38s -> 1901.78s]  Your highness, I'm totally asking you, please make a new Saturn, please. All right. This one's
[1901.78s -> 1907.21s]  actually really good because this is just like a, all right. You just like, you twisted the knife
[1907.21s -> 1916.73s]  a little. I like it. It's funny. Chief, where is it? It was funny. Chief visual learning officer
[1917.45s -> 1932.54s]  at off-brand. Yeah. Come on. All jokes aside though, I'm going to try to do as best I can.
[1933.18s -> 1939.14s]  I really am. There's a lot of people that have a lot of cool ideas. I would love to develop them
[1939.14s -> 1951.30s]  with them. Hope I do a good job. We are what we are because of our tights, safe and snug,
[1951.38s -> 1967.46s]  fit and fab. That's how we'll make this Katamari. And you do a Microsoft Excel stream because now
[1967.46s -> 1980.10s]  you're an executive. Well, I don't know how to use Excel. Okay. 20 centimeters is about this big.
[1980.10s -> 1991.91s]  Ready? Here it is. Okay. So that's how big it is. All right. It's all yours. Okay. So I have to make
[1991.91s -> 2014.98s]  a 20 centimeter ball. I have a no time limit. 20 centimeters, by the way. Do you even know how to
[2014.98s -> 2027.48s]  use Microsoft Word? I know that a popular belief would have you think that I write all of my ideas
[2027.48s -> 2034.79s]  and all of my shows on like a bag of a napkin. That's kind of, I mean, that's somewhat true.
[2041.40s -> 2048.44s]  Ludwig tweeted. What did he say? Derma being my coworker is now the coolest thing about me.
[2052.28s -> 2054.20s]  He's such a cool fucking dude. He really is.
[2055.08s -> 2073.83s]  Oh, I'm excited, man. Let's, let's do some cool shit. My first order of business
[2076.28s -> 2107.70s]  is in the company break room. There must be mini M&Ms. Not even fucking looking at the game.
[2110.74s -> 2114.82s]  I've been just walking into walls, just reading chat and looking over at bod chat.
[2115.90s -> 2121.54s]  It's a big day. All right. Like we're going to retry. It's kind of, it's kind of a wild day today.
[2124.71s -> 2127.21s]  OK, I need to make it 20 centimeters.
[2133.30s -> 2136.50s]  Oh, there's no time limit. It's OK. But I wasn't paying attention. Now I'm going to
[2138.54s -> 2160.63s]  pick up the chocolate beatbox now. OK, this is me.
[2160.63s -> 2186.10s]  If we were in the break room. Hold on. What are you saying?
[2188.50s -> 2195.43s]  I'm sorry. It's a big day. If you were in a break room, you would have another apple juice.
[2196.15s -> 2201.82s]  What? Oh, you mean like I would take apple? Well, whatever. They already know all this.
[2202.78s -> 2220.42s]  This is getting close. I wouldn't say it's there yet. I think after all these glues.
[2221.30s -> 2233.74s]  What do you think? It's almost there. A little bit more.
[2242.55s -> 2249.18s]  I think this is good. Yeah, this is it right here. I'm going to say that's it.
[2250.22s -> 2265.56s]  Might be too big. Who knows? All right, let's find out. I just show up to work
[2265.72s -> 2273.46s]  and your boss is never wearing pants or underwear. Wait, what? Why did I read that?
[2273.46s -> 2288.50s]  Wait, why did I just read that? Why did I read that? I read that so nonchalantly like it was
[2288.50s -> 2294.58s]  just a regular message. Oh, man, there's no wear pants and no underwear. What the fuck?
[2294.58s -> 2308.04s]  I didn't want to read that. I just kept reading and reading and reading and reading and it just
[2308.04s -> 2314.39s]  didn't stop. Why do you read the most unhinged messages? Well, I don't know, because everyone's
[2314.39s -> 2332.10s]  writing salad right now and there's one fucking weird message in the middle. Hey, wait, wait, wait,
[2332.10s -> 2339.13s]  14. OK, OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. I can do. Yeah, I can do better than that. So it has to be much
[2339.13s -> 2359.50s]  bigger than that. OK, let's do it again. Move the cursor or I'm going to call or I'm going to call
[2359.50s -> 2417.70s]  your boss. OK. Oh, baby crying sounds. There he is. Cool. I want to do that one again. Which
[2417.70s -> 2439.13s]  one was it? This one here? It was this one, right? 20 centimeters. I can do it. It's two meters next.
[2439.13s -> 2458.71s]  Is it? Oh, we smell. Wait, this is different. Oh, they change it up on you. They don't want
[2458.71s -> 2469.13s]  you to be able to go in and just grind it. All right. Two meters. That's way. That's huge. All
[2469.13s -> 2492.81s]  right. I got to. There's two or three versions of every level. Oh, cool. Why did you just fake
[2492.81s -> 2498.34s]  excitement? I add that was genuine excitement that I turned into fake excitement because I
[2498.34s -> 2502.34s]  didn't want anyone to bat chest me because I was genuinely excited about having three different
[2502.34s -> 2508.34s]  levels per level. And I was afraid because I was excited about something on the Internet.
[2509.30s -> 2529.22s]  And I thought I was going to get yelled at for it. Oh, you're just just give me more power.
[2529.86s -> 2562.14s]  Give me more of them. All right. Two meters. Take my energy, Jerma.
[2583.37s -> 2587.86s]  I just joined. Who the fuck is this guy? Oh, you from the tweet? Well,
[2589.14s -> 2596.90s]  my name is Jerma985, Chief Creative Officer of Okran. You might know me as the guy that did that
[2596.90s -> 2605.29s]  dollhouse stream one time. You also might know me from such unbelievable bangers as meme image
[2605.29s -> 2610.41s]  I didn't make as the most popular thing that's ever happened to this channel that had nothing
[2610.41s -> 2616.81s]  to do with I had I didn't do it. Somebody else did. They stretched up my face and made put me
[2616.81s -> 2640.22s]  like in an Among Us cartoon. And I also talk about food. I'm pretty strong. I think I'm at
[2640.22s -> 2662.71s]  two meters. You may have seen me at Team Fortress two long time ago. Oh, they put it up in the
[2662.71s -> 2685.26s]  discord. That's funny. OK, did I do it? It wasn't even close. Shit. I thought I was going over.
[2685.90s -> 2694.86s]  You play Life is Strange? I did. I played the original long time ago. Pretty much when it first
[2694.86s -> 2704.95s]  came out. All right. Well, these ones are hard. We'd like that in a Saturn. Let's pop it up.
[2714.30s -> 2730.68s]  I guess it wasn't that far off. 1.4 to 2. It is. What's this one? Oh, Your Highness really is
[2730.68s -> 2736.76s]  resplendent. Yeah, I love studying. So I haven't played Katamari these days. I'm really sorry.
[2736.76s -> 2743.24s]  Anyway, I study so much that they cut it off. Cut off the electricity to my apartment.
[2743.32s -> 2748.76s]  I do nothing but study so I don't earn any money. That's why I didn't even notice.
[2749.56s -> 2753.74s]  But I do want to study when it's dark at night. Your Highness, can you help?
[2759.29s -> 2766.65s]  They're sharing an image in the discord right now that I cannot publicly share. But they're
[2766.65s -> 2774.06s]  sharing it nonetheless. I cannot publicly share that image. You know, it's kind of a brand issue,
[2774.06s -> 2789.88s]  I think. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2789.88s -> 2795.08s]  Oh, I thought that was real. I was like, what the fuck? Somebody said, just check the website and
[2795.08s -> 2798.74s]  look at the picture they used for you. And it was me sitting naked in the chair. I was like,
[2798.74s -> 2803.83s]  did they do that? No. All right, it's edited. Oh, shit. I was like, what the hell? I was like,
[2803.83s -> 2811.62s]  all right, well, that's the direction. Yes, it's a little brighter. What? No, you're talking about a
[2811.62s -> 2818.71s]  van? We forbid it. It's all about us. So much larger than life, you're the king of all cosmos,
[2818.71s -> 2840.70s]  all right. Larger than life? I agree. That's no good. Too dark is no good. Somebody said,
[2840.70s -> 2855.45s]  I have to admit, that would be a creative photo to use. Okay, what's going on in the game?
[2855.45s -> 2863.64s]  Anyways, this is our bookish fan studying by nothing more than the light of the moon.
[2863.64s -> 2871.10s]  Let's give this boy a brighter future. Yes. Roll up a bunch of fireflies, then roll him up in
[2871.10s -> 2876.38s]  the Katamari to brighten things up. If you can manage it in this time, that would be romantic.
[2876.38s -> 2903.13s]  We know you can do it, honey. Fireflies. So just make it really bright. I'll take it slow. I don't
[2903.13s -> 2909.14s]  want to go too fast because I'll miss the little crunchies, whatever they are. Oh, fireflies. No,
[2909.14s -> 2931.22s]  they're not crunchies. Do not eat these. No, don't eat these. That's right. Okay. It's still very
[2931.22s -> 2953.56s]  dark. Looking at some other questions and stuff. Just looking at questions. If anything rolls in
[2953.56s -> 2964.49s]  that I can answer, I will answer it. I haven't really started. So there's some things that
[2964.49s -> 2970.98s]  off-brand is doing that I have not really participated in because obviously this announcement
[2970.98s -> 2977.14s]  today and some of the other stuff, right. Um, this is kind of starting as of production stuff
[2977.14s -> 2995.83s]  for like as of now forward. I can't climb that. You're going to wear a suit every day. I was
[2995.83s -> 3001.46s]  thinking about wearing a suit running on the face game and having like super Mario pajamas on my
[3001.46s -> 3007.64s]  pants and stand up at some point to get a coffee and you guys can see I was like, but I didn't have
[3007.64s -> 3019.29s]  very much time to, I had to, I had to get out of here and then come back with like a super Mario
[3019.29s -> 3050.47s]  ice cream or something. All right. It's still dark technically. Yeah. I can't, I'm going to answer.
[3052.23s -> 3058.39s]  All right. So here's the thing. I will answer questions like, hmm, so what kind of, no,
[3058.39s -> 3063.91s]  that's such a softball question. What kind of projects do you think you'd be the most excited
[3063.91s -> 3068.47s]  about? Like, all right, did you just, did you just give me a fucking layup? Is that really
[3073.13s -> 3079.21s]  somebody? Yeah, but I'm sorry. I'm not. Hey, Gerber, what's your, how much money are you making?
[3081.16s -> 3101.26s]  No, I'm not going to answer these questions. It's his first day. It's my first day.
[3103.03s -> 3109.77s]  It's my first day and I'm playing Katamari Damacy. Oh shit. I'm going to get in trouble.
[3118.31s -> 3122.87s]  Oh, hey guys. Where's, where's Gerber? We're doing our, our, you know, day one company meeting.
[3122.87s -> 3130.04s]  Where is he? Oh, he's like joking about being naked and playing Katamari Damacy. The meeting was
[3130.04s -> 3142.86s]  at 4 30. All right. If I get to bright, it should be fine. Right. Is there more over there? I don't
[3142.86s -> 3165.43s]  know. Hey, what's the best part about working with off-brand? Ah, let me answer that. Hey, Gerber,
[3165.43s -> 3169.27s]  what would you say your level of excitement is right now? Well, I would say it's definitely at
[3169.27s -> 3194.12s]  least like a nine or a 10. Working with off-brand to me seems like kind of bright, kind of bright.
[3194.12s -> 3202.09s]  It's got to be pretty good. Right. Oh, um, I am itching to go. I'm itching to just get started
[3202.09s -> 3219.30s]  on a project and just start typing, get involved. If I was your intern, would you make me use me as
[3219.30s -> 3250.01s]  a human footstool? No, I wouldn't. Is that, is that from a TV show? I'm not reading chat anymore.
[3250.57s -> 3256.54s]  Hey, I got to look, I got a sponsor segment coming up. So you can't, you can't write that shit
[3256.54s -> 3263.82s]  anymore. Hey, I'm goddamn chief creative officer of off-brand. Okay. Let's clean it up a little.
[3272.84s -> 3286.39s]  Ooh, look, wait, it's bright. What's wrong with it? You can have this thing. Oh, it's, it's,
[3286.39s -> 3304.47s]  it was bright. So what do you guys think? Let's get some feedback here because I all jokes aside,
[3304.47s -> 3320.58s]  I genuinely am really, really happy about this. What does off-brand do? Off-brand is a company
[3321.14s -> 3344.54s]  that facilitates multimedia reductions. You need flashcards? No. And also to a lot of these things.
[3344.54s -> 3349.42s]  I know a lot of people have a lot of questions and I know what we're jokingly, we are jokingly
[3349.42s -> 3355.26s]  answering them, but I be honest, I really, I need to see, we need to see how this plays out,
[3355.26s -> 3361.74s]  what the workflow is like, what, um, how long I'm going to be spending on certain things and what,
[3362.30s -> 3370.44s]  who I'm going to be working with every day. And I actually, I, it's so new that I probably could
[3370.44s -> 3379.59s]  answer a lot of these questions in the next few weeks, but all I can tell you now is that I'm
[3379.59s -> 3391.29s]  excited. Yeah. So, uh, referencing somebody mentioned a good point, um, like the baseball
[3391.29s -> 3395.85s]  stream, the Christmas stream, the dollhouse show, those are the kinds of things that I'm,
[3395.85s -> 3399.83s]  I want to be working on. And not just that either. There's going to be a lot,
[3399.83s -> 3402.79s]  there's a lot of projects that are going to probably come through off-brand that are not
[3403.43s -> 3412.39s]  dollhouse streams, dollhouse level streams. Um, I've made it pretty clear that if some,
[3412.39s -> 3418.06s]  if there's a cool project to work on, I, I want to work on it. I don't care how much it costs or
[3418.06s -> 3422.62s]  what, if it's, oh, well, that's not going to be that expensive or that's going to be too expensive.
[3422.62s -> 3425.90s]  I think it's just pretty much anything and everything, whatever I can put my hand into,
[3425.90s -> 3432.68s]  whatever I can try to make, um, it better if I can, whatever it is, I'm going to try to.
[3432.68s -> 3448.65s]  Will you still stream? Yes. Uh, if you missed the first part of the stream, I did
[3448.65s -> 3454.44s]  go over that a little bit. Streams are not stopping, but I do have a job
[3455.51s -> 3461.10s]  that I have to do and I'm going to have to pay attention to. So not going anywhere,
[3461.10s -> 3472.28s]  not stopping streaming. Okay. I like this one. Can I show this one? Is anybody from off-brand here?
[3472.28s -> 3478.09s]  Can I show this one, the me as the vampire? Can I show that one? That's all right. That's like
[3478.25s -> 3491.69s]  company policy. That's fine. Right. It's me as a vampire as, um, well, you'll see it in the
[3491.69s -> 3509.11s]  discord. I'm going to show it. I don't care. It's too good. It's just, it's just too funny. I have
[3509.11s -> 3534.39s]  to show it. Imagine if they used this. It's stupid. Like that's, if I've requested that,
[3534.39s -> 3556.92s]  that would be like a personal request. What was the most important thing that led you to
[3556.92s -> 3562.81s]  this decision? That's a really good question actually. Thank you. Person that obviously did
[3562.81s -> 3566.97s]  not get planted there to say that. They really didn't. Like, I'm just fucking around. They
[3566.97s -> 3574.95s]  actually asked a good question. Uh, so I have my most fun when I'm coming up with something to do
[3576.92s -> 3582.97s]  and as much as I love, I still genuinely enjoy hanging out and playing games and, you know,
[3582.97s -> 3589.29s]  spending time with the stream and doing this stuff. I am at my happiest coming up with it and trying
[3589.29s -> 3595.43s]  to execute on something just kind of wacky. Uh, and that again, that's not to say that I don't
[3595.43s -> 3608.18s]  like streaming. What just happened? A bear for sure. Finally got one. Want to go home now?
[3608.18s -> 3615.69s]  Oh, well, I think I'm supposed to avoid the bears. You know the rules. All right. Good luck. What
[3615.69s -> 3626.06s]  would the wait, what are the rules? I have to avoid them, right? You need to get the, how is there
[3626.06s -> 3657.22s]  a bear in front of me? Okay. I need to get a huge bear. Well, that's not fair. Okay. So I just have
[3657.22s -> 3663.38s]  to get, I have to get huge without touching a bear. Look at that. I love my favorite thing.
[3665.56s -> 3681.74s]  What? Oh, it's cow themed. You guys are fucking just absolutely roasting me in the sub stream.
[3684.66s -> 3688.42s]  So many of these images are popping up. It's like, I can't even keep track of them anymore.
[3690.31s -> 3701.27s]  Like so many of these with just a different fucked up image is popping up. What? Where?
[3701.27s -> 3726.15s]  Oh, okay. I'm done. That was a fun one. See you tomorrow. So true. Bye. What's this Katamari?
[3726.15s -> 3731.59s]  You caught it while we were on the phone. Seriously? The cow bear? By honey? For real?
[3732.31s -> 3739.06s]  We apologize, Mr. Cow Bear. We're rolling up such a small bear. There's no point in having such a
[3739.06s -> 3745.24s]  small bear at the ranch. Pay attention to your surroundings when you roll. Stay calm and focused
[3745.24s -> 3750.95s]  when rolling. Hey, it's really okay. You don't need to say you're sorry. Should have just caught
[3750.95s -> 3770.82s]  them myself really. Oh, well we get to keep it. So we said, hey dude, why are you so popular?
[3770.82s -> 3783.08s]  Um, I don't, I don't know. I don't know. And I don't know how popular I really am.
[3783.80s -> 3800.07s]  Yeah, I don't, am I? Is that dog still in the select plaza? Woof, it could work out. Woof.
[3800.07s -> 3812.15s]  Oh, there's a bunch of those King of the Cosmos missions too. Dog, I want to roll up the brightness.
[3812.15s -> 3825.22s]  Somebody else just wanted to do that too. If you found someone you considered funnier than yourself
[3825.22s -> 3834.12s]  and had the chance to trade fame with them, would you? No, absolutely not. No, 100% no.
[3834.12s -> 3842.74s]  If you're good, that's, that's good. I'm cool with being where I am. I don't,
[3842.74s -> 3866.90s]  I don't want to trade places with anybody. What about trading consciousness with someone? Um, no.
[3867.70s -> 3879.80s]  We have a dog among our fans. Yes, and she talks and talks this dog. Hmm, what did you say?
[3880.76s -> 3887.00s]  Woof, want to roll up? Woof, roll up the sun. We heard it. We heard it loud and clear. Yes,
[3887.00s -> 3893.42s]  we weren't hearing things amazing. Yes, our course is clear. Off to the sun we go.
[3895.88s -> 3907.45s]  Oh, are all the main missions done? Okie dokie. Want to go for the sun? Want to roll the earth
[3907.45s -> 3937.99s]  and roll up the sun? We know you can do it. I don't think I'm quite ready. Well, however you've seen
[3937.99s -> 3944.81s]  this channel over the years, whether you like it or you don't, hopefully you can take something from
[3944.81s -> 3954.01s]  it that at least, I don't know, makes you feel better. If you don't like the stream, if you don't
[3954.01s -> 3959.06s]  like me, whatever, that's fine. If you do like this place, if you do like what's going on here,
[3959.06s -> 3976.28s]  that's great. Cool. That's all I really will ever say about it. I'm never going to be bigger than
[3976.28s -> 3994.18s]  the sun. I think I've tried over the years to, I don't know. I'm just trying to do as best I can.
[3994.90s -> 4014.78s]  That's it. It's all it ever was and all it probably ever will be. You're doing great,
[4014.78s -> 4042.90s]  sweetie. Thank you. Oh, oh, oh, oh, am I big enough? Unfortunately, you peeked at coffee
[4042.90s -> 4055.53s]  Cheetos chicken. That's some truth to that, I think. Well, there are no more, let's see,
[4055.53s -> 4074.36s]  there are no more planets. Let's see if I can get it. Did I get it? Oh, shit, I got it. Rolled up
[4074.36s -> 4080.60s]  the sun. It's a huge deal, but there's something else that's kind of, you rolled the world into one,
[4081.08s -> 4085.70s]  you know, we don't really know whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. But
[4086.34s -> 4093.96s]  it's powerful global news. Earth must be going nuts now. Oh, you were rolling Earth.
[4094.52s -> 4099.64s]  Wonder if our fans are all right. Ah, we feel something. We're feeling the presence of each
[4099.64s -> 4105.14s]  and every fan. Earth is fine. Don't worry, your highness. That's what they're saying. Oh,
[4105.14s -> 4111.64s]  what a relief. Come to think of it, this game mission was to roll a Katamari to, you know,
[4113.42s -> 4122.92s]  rant fans their wishes. There are still other fans on Earth. Maybe we didn't grant all their wishes
[4122.92s -> 4130.17s]  yet. But then again, rolling up the sun is such a happy thing. So we're going straight on to the
[4130.17s -> 4137.30s]  ending. The king decrees it. So now here's the profoundly moving ending coming up fast. Not the
[4137.30s -> 4147.82s]  end. I have to get ready. We'll just go on ahead. See you later. I know the curse is on the screen.
[4147.82s -> 4200.89s]  I can't get it off. I can do better than that. Anybody here? Namco. Didn't the creator of
[4200.89s -> 4225.16s]  Katamari going to make a couple of the games? Oh, come here. I can't, I can't have people come
[4225.16s -> 4265.75s]  with me. Oh, come on, cousin. Run. Run, cousin. Don't show the vampire anymore. I'm gonna get a
[4265.75s -> 4292.09s]  word in the letter. King of Ken. Wait, they're making another one? Are they actually making
[4292.09s -> 4301.58s]  another Katamari? Oh, not, not Katamari. Okay. Turn the volume up, by the way. I'm turning the
[4301.58s -> 4325.37s]  song up. Oh, I got grabbed. I told you to dodge. I didn't know how to dodge that quickly. You
[4325.37s -> 4355.96s]  fucked it up. Okay. You can replay it. I'll replay it and I'll dodge. But there's more levels. We're
[4355.96s -> 4364.46s]  not done. There's at least four or five more levels to do. When are you gonna play Monster
[4364.46s -> 4379.16s]  Rancher DS? That sounds really fun. What class should I play in Diablo 4? The Sorceress.
[4381.38s -> 4405.18s]  The only one. Or uh, yeah, Necro. Druid all the way. I tried Druid. I tried Werewolf Druid
[4405.18s -> 4422.30s]  and I got to like level 20 something. I was just like, I hate this. And then I changed to
[4422.30s -> 4435.26s]  Sorceress. I was like, this is kind of fun. This game's kind of fun. Is it gonna be loud? I'm
[4435.26s -> 4463.82s]  turning it down. Let's go. Oh, you were so close. Just a little more. Just a teeny bit. Just a
[4463.82s -> 4477.10s]  squash. That's always the way it is. Just a little bit more. Cool. All right. So now what's this one?
[4478.06s -> 4486.22s]  Hello. It's been a while. It's we met in Katamari Damase. That was a great experience. Looks like
[4486.22s -> 4493.34s]  it also put the Hoshino family on the map. But wait, who cares? Earth is in danger. Your Highness
[4493.34s -> 4510.86s]  is the only one who can save us all. Please, we need your help. Okay. Earth is blue. A very
[4510.86s -> 4516.38s]  beautiful star, yes. Hope that it can hold a candle to the great cosmos. Oh, honey.
[4517.10s -> 4524.28s]  Hmm. Giant asteroid is headed towards Earth. Oh, sounds like fun. Please help us. We're all
[4524.28s -> 4530.71s]  waiting for your Highness. All waiting? Oh, so you really were waiting. All righty. We'll totally
[4530.71s -> 4544.10s]  save Earth. Danger. Earth is in danger. Trouble of the planet is in big trouble. If you don't hurry
[4544.10s -> 4549.45s]  up and roll a really big Katamari, Earth is going to have even more problems. This is going to
[4549.45s -> 4565.70s]  smash into Earth. Sounds bad. Honey, you have to hurry or Earth is toast. Somebody help. Oh,
[4565.70s -> 4574.81s]  you're picking up all the countries. Okay. Cool. Come on. How many countries are on Earth?
[4575.61s -> 4590.31s]  Shit. I gotta get like all the islands. Oh my goodness. There goes all of... Okay, but that was
[4590.31s -> 4639.72s]  all of Europe? Africa? It's almost here. Why is the Earth round? What's this one? Where's the...
[4640.52s -> 4652.89s]  I should have said, where's the United States? I know where it is. I just... I'm going to get...
[4653.61s -> 4667.40s]  This is all of Africa. I have to get 100%. All right. Oh my god. It's right here.
[4668.84s -> 4687.16s]  I got USA, Canada. Oh, I got Brazil. What's left? Am I not big enough to pick up? I can't pick up
[4687.16s -> 4710.42s]  Russia. Get it. That's it. Wait, there's like one island. No. Oh, no. The Earth is gone. No more
[4710.42s -> 4719.03s]  Katamari to bossy, I guess. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Control the Katamari
[4719.03s -> 4724.07s]  properly. Next time will be different. We have a brand new Earth ready to go. We'll definitely
[4724.07s -> 4741.11s]  save this one. Seriously. Okay, let's go. I cannot go fast. Retry. All the islands around me. Move
[4741.11s -> 4749.88s]  your mouse, please. I'm telling you. I can't do it. I got to stay around here and get the islands.
[4749.88s -> 4770.41s]  It's a good start. Good start. That's a good start.
[4774.25s -> 4787.94s]  Come on. Can I get the United States yet? No. Sorry. South America.
[4788.58s -> 4823.35s]  I can't get Brazil. I'll come back for it. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. What am I missing?
[4823.35s -> 4859.54s]  What am I missing? Okay. Good. The pace is fine. The pace is fine. The pace is perfectly fine.
[4860.18s -> 4870.55s]  I got Australia. I got China. This is Russia. All right. I got it. I got everything. Did I get
[4870.55s -> 4886.71s]  everything? Did I get everything? Get the meteor? Holy shit. I didn't think I had to do that.
[4887.27s -> 4899.62s]  I thought I just did a save or everything. That's like two pixels away, isn't it?
[4901.32s -> 4913.26s]  It's a little further than that. What should I make for my birthday dinner?
[4913.98s -> 4916.46s]  Buffalo chicken. If you like it. If you can handle it.
[4918.74s -> 4933.54s]  Buffalo chicken subs. 100%. Everyone on our earth is all right. We just confirmed it.
[4933.54s -> 4946.65s]  It turned out well. Cool. Tell you the truth. I'd given up, but we all managed to survive.
[4946.65s -> 4949.34s]  It's a token of our gratitude. We'd like your highness.
[4953.59s -> 4958.14s]  Seriously. Fabulous. Thank you. We are so pleased. What should we do with it?
[4958.78s -> 4978.01s]  Sorry. I'm just imagining it being... I'm just thinking if I was a teacher,
[4979.48s -> 4983.96s]  it would be such a pain in the ass to get the class to just shut the fuck up and
[4983.96s -> 4990.62s]  pay attention again. Do you know what I'm saying? In the middle of teaching in a classroom being
[4990.62s -> 5002.55s]  like, okay, kids. Be like, what was that? It was, I had a late lunch today. Be like,
[5002.55s -> 5014.79s]  everybody stop talking now. Stop talking. That's enough. Streaming is so interesting because
[5015.59s -> 5020.31s]  you may have just laughed out loud at me and I have no idea. I'm just still going. We're just
[5020.31s -> 5040.46s]  going. That was kind of a small Katamari. Let's try it again. What did you say? Did you forget
[5040.46s -> 5049.58s]  that you have already told us? I already told you what? Imagine if you could hear all of us
[5049.58s -> 5062.18s]  like a laugh track. That'd be so awful. That one time I went into discord and there was like
[5062.18s -> 5074.34s]  about 200 people in that call. Times that by 10. We are not that easy. All right, so we did this
[5074.34s -> 5086.09s]  one before but I think it has to be big, right? We're not big. This one has to be... We're sick
[5086.09s -> 5091.05s]  and tired of just making it bigger. So we had a notion. We had a notion even though we're starving,
[5091.94s -> 5099.16s]  just try rolling as quickly as possible and get it to about this big. You can do it. We know.
[5099.16s -> 5104.82s]  All righty, good luck. All right, just get it to 50 and then submit it.
[5121.85s -> 5127.53s]  Do the teacher noise. I don't even think I could anymore. I have to be like really excitable to do
[5127.53s -> 5176.73s]  it. I have to be super excited. Try it. I could probably do it. Shit. All right, good. I'll be
[5176.73s -> 5209.80s]  happy if I can do this in two minutes. Damn it. This is it right here. Under two minutes. Come on.
[5213.37s -> 5247.86s]  Get it. No, I'm not going to get it. Hurry. Okay, 220. That's not great. That's not bad.
[5248.50s -> 5260.50s]  I'll try to do it. Turn your volume down because it's probably going to be annoying.
[5260.50s -> 5285.54s]  You guys ready? Ready? Definitely turn your volume down. 50 fucking years old. I still got it.
[5299.21s -> 5302.09s]  Hey, don't ever ask me for that ever again because I won't do it.
[5302.65s -> 5326.17s]  Do you understand? Oh, shit. Sorry. I was looking at like off brands Twitter. It's like, oh, cool.
[5326.97s -> 5337.21s]  What are people saying? Do a moment? No, that doesn't. We don't need a moment for that.
[5337.21s -> 5358.63s]  Hey, you guys pumped for Final Fantasy 16 demo sponsor segment coming up very soon in the next
[5358.63s -> 5374.36s]  probably couple hours. I want to do some of these because these are new.
[5381.34s -> 5390.54s]  Ballerina hunt study time. Is this seriously your last stream? No, I just told you we're playing
[5390.54s -> 5404.47s]  zoom beanies in like two days. Extra special training. Night school. Lots of wheels. Let's do
[5404.47s -> 5412.20s]  night school. Oh, that one is the last one. No, I just told you we're playing sorcery after that.
[5412.76s -> 5424.50s]  Like three days after that. And then that's the yeah. Okay, I see what's going on.
[5424.50s -> 5432.31s]  Hurry to the school and get them. All right, so I'm the king of the cosmos right now.
[5432.31s -> 5449.62s]  Okay, don't be afraid of ghosts. Just hurry and get the forgotten instruments. Five in total.
[5450.18s -> 5463.16s]  If you touch a ghost, you have to leave. What? I need to get the five instruments.
[5464.20s -> 5482.65s]  Are they in this room? There's one here. Hey, quarter. Oh, shit.
[5488.28s -> 5500.49s]  Can I leave? I can leave. Oh, my God. I'm just gonna hug the wall. All right, take an observation
[5500.49s -> 5525.69s]  first. Where is it? Hey, there it is. How do I climb this? Okay, wait, can I even get that?
[5528.06s -> 5558.36s]  Do I have to get bigger? Oh, I'm done. Don't touch the ghost. I bounced.
[5563.18s -> 5574.90s]  It'd be so funny if you played Five Nights at Freddy's. That would be actually pretty funny.
[5575.54s -> 5589.35s]  Okay, what about lots of wheels? First, collect the tires. Run and run into the sunset. Become
[5589.35s -> 5603.06s]  a charming king. You get presents for these. Oh, cool. I'm into that. You got the Katabari
[5603.06s -> 5618.97s]  faster than usual. Run, just run. Get lots of tires. Oh, you gotta be big enough to do that.
[5619.69s -> 5668.92s]  Four minutes? I'm too small for that. Tires. I only have nine tires. I need to be big enough to
[5668.92s -> 5703.38s]  pick up cars. I'm taking pick up cars. It's all over. All right, come on. Level up. All right,
[5703.38s -> 5732.68s]  I'm gonna be upgrading in a second here. Give me these. Oh, well, there's a whole tire factory
[5732.68s -> 5761.35s]  over here. I need to be big enough to pick up the actual cars. There we go. Hurry up.
[5761.35s -> 5774.97s]  Not big enough. Shit. All right, where? Somebody said I was missing tires. What about all this?
[5775.61s -> 5828.33s]  What about these Minecraft houses up here? I got 200. There they are. 350? 20 seconds. I
[5828.33s -> 5855.40s]  can pick up cars. No, I can't. Damn it. It's all right. Barely passing. The real test starts now.
[5857.05s -> 5872.97s]  Shut up. God, did that happen? We think we were better than that. We aren't a prince.
[5874.50s -> 5894.41s]  50%. That's it. That's a challenge mode. Okay, so I did this one. I did this one.
[5896.12s -> 5904.57s]  Extra special training. Stop skipping salad. I don't think there is a salad in this one.
[5905.77s -> 5910.81s]  I'm gonna do the 17 minutes to make a huge one again because I think I can do better than I did.
[5911.45s -> 5925.66s]  Collect fighting spirit and seize victory. Become a brave king. Yeah, these are new. These
[5925.66s -> 5937.86s]  missions are new as of the remaster. Shadow boxing boxer. Very sexy. If you get burning
[5937.86s -> 5949.05s]  fighting spirit, your punches will get stronger. Roll until your ashes. What is that?
[5954.70s -> 5959.42s]  Okay, I'm imagining... Does it get... Okay, the water does not affect it. You just have to get burnt?
[5959.42s -> 6005.02s]  Street Fighter 6. I'm not picking anything up besides the fire. Is this a mistake?
[6011.26s -> 6031.59s]  Oh, hold on. Look at this. There we go. This song's pretty good, huh? Yeah, I think I have
[6031.59s -> 6062.62s]  this set to favorite songs. That's why it keeps playing. This is one of those songs.
[6063.26s -> 6076.84s]  This is such a summertime. Windows down. Volume up. Cruisin' kind of song. Not too loud.
[6077.56s -> 6098.50s]  Not too loud. Loud enough to enjoy it, but not too loud to distract your driving. Not too loud.
[6101.64s -> 6112.50s]  Centrist Andy. Yeah, turn it up. Turn the volume up. Let's go pump it. No, but not too much volume.
[6112.50s -> 6130.50s]  Maybe a little more than halfway is fine, though. Battle Damacy roll time. Oh, you got your salad.
[6130.50s -> 6153.96s]  Yeah, there it is. I have not completed one of these. These are tricky. Salad. I think both
[6153.96s -> 6157.64s]  quiet and loud volume have pros and cons to consider with that face of me moving around and
[6157.64s -> 6167.94s]  talking quickly. No, that is accurate. What you're saying is the truth. There is a time and a place
[6167.94s -> 6177.51s]  for low music and loud music. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I offend anybody here, but if I go out,
[6177.59s -> 6182.87s]  I'm at an establishment, and I want to go out and have a couple drinks and talk. I want to be able
[6182.87s -> 6190.49s]  to hear you talking. I'd like to hear you speaking. Here we go. Here he goes. Here he goes. Here he
[6190.49s -> 6202.74s]  goes. I would like to hear you talk. A lot of establishments play very, very, very loud music
[6202.74s -> 6214.55s]  to the point where you're talking over a vacuum cleaner for the entire night. I propose a separate
[6214.55s -> 6223.86s]  room in every establishment that is closed off. That is the same building. It's just a place to go
[6223.86s -> 6231.26s]  to get away from the loud music. This place can be decorated the same. It can be the same spot. It's
[6231.26s -> 6248.44s]  just, hey, this is a room here that's a little bit quieter. You can have a conversation if you want.
[6248.44s -> 6258.06s]  No, I'm not talking about a sensory room. What do you mean a sensory room? I didn't even pay
[6258.06s -> 6263.94s]  attention to what this was. What? No, I'm saying it's this.
[6270.57s -> 6277.29s]  Wait, what? And then you turn your head, tilt, and aim your ear at their fucking mouth.
[6278.17s -> 6287.56s]  Huh? I have to aim my ear directly at your mouth talking and lean in and lean in and put my hand up
[6287.56s -> 6301.51s]  and tilt. I didn't pay attention again. Don't give up. Won't allow it.
[6301.51s -> 6310.06s]  Roll Katamari until you collapse. Become the king of all cosmos.
[6310.06s -> 6316.18s]  Anytime I'm in a place where there's a bunch of music playing, like a bar or it's just like,
[6316.18s -> 6323.34s]  I want to hear you talk. Let's go out and have a few drinks and talk.
[6326.42s -> 6328.18s]  Let's do some interpersonal communication.
[6340.95s -> 6346.17s]  I just asked if I wanted to get fucking pizza and then I said yes. And then everybody at the
[6346.17s -> 6351.67s]  end of the night. Everybody at the end of the night sounds like this. Yeah, yeah, no, I'll call
[6351.67s -> 6356.94s]  you to see what you're up to tomorrow. Yeah, give me a call when you have a chance. I'll probably
[6356.94s -> 6381.00s]  get up at like 11 or something. I want interpersonal communication. Hey, look, I get it. Sometimes,
[6381.94s -> 6386.66s]  sometimes you just want to just fucking rock out to some music and you don't want to talk to
[6386.66s -> 6392.26s]  fucking anybody. I don't want to talk to some fucking asshole. I just want to rock out. Yeah,
[6392.26s -> 6396.38s]  that's fine. Absolutely. Go for it.
[6400.87s -> 6428.70s]  I was supposed to be picking up ballerinas and I have not found one. You know how places do like,
[6428.70s -> 6436.76s]  oh, we're doing loud music Fridays. I would love for a bar or like a place to go like hang out
[6436.76s -> 6447.82s]  or anywhere. Never be like, hey, this is quieted down Fridays where we play the music 50% softer
[6449.85s -> 6467.27s]  and quiet reading time. You guys don't want this? No, it's not a library. They would be playing
[6467.27s -> 6474.58s]  music just loud enough where you can actually talk to people. Look, I like loud environments,
[6474.58s -> 6479.78s]  too. It's not that I don't like a loud environment. It's just there's an environment where I want to
[6479.78s -> 6486.18s]  talk to people. And when you stand around in a circle with four or five buds and you all have
[6486.26s -> 6490.42s]  a cocktail in your hand and everyone just kind of looking at each other because I know I'm not
[6490.42s -> 6497.62s]  going to be able to hear you. So I just kind of sip the drink and nod at you. Sip and nod at you
[6497.62s -> 6517.51s]  and then walk the other direction. Do you start every conversation with I would like to start a
[6517.51s -> 6533.13s]  dialogue? Bro, just go to the grocery store. No, but I'll tell you the grocery store is a good
[6533.13s -> 6539.24s]  example of the kind of level of audio that I am looking for. That is the level of audio that I am
[6539.24s -> 6544.17s]  looking for. And look, every now and again, you know, when they play, you know, when they play
[6544.17s -> 6553.90s]  tequila, it's like, all right, turned up. I'm talking to you and we kind of have our drinks.
[6553.90s -> 6559.50s]  Yeah. So I think about that business meeting. I'm going to be like, all right,
[6560.71s -> 6563.91s]  we you understand what this is going to get loud. So we're going to rock out, right?
[6565.14s -> 6572.78s]  I'm rocking out to tequila. And by rocking out to tequila, I mean putting the straw up,
[6572.78s -> 6579.64s]  sipping, sipping the drink and just like moving my shoulders left and right. Yeah, tequila.
[6587.08s -> 6592.28s]  And then someone does the Pee Wee Herman and everybody freaks the fuck out every time. You,
[6592.28s -> 6600.04s]  I'm telling you right now, if you want to make sure that you are, you are awesome at one of these
[6600.04s -> 6604.12s]  at a party or something. If tequila comes on and you do the Pee Wee Herman dance,
[6605.08s -> 6620.47s]  you just made like 10 new friends. At least I'm not doing this right at all.
[6629.58s -> 6638.58s]  Everybody knows that intro. What the hell is the Pee Wee Herman? It's the two fists closed,
[6640.06s -> 6646.46s]  right foot out, sticking out, bent at the knee. And it's you go forward, tap, tap your fist
[6646.46s -> 6653.66s]  closed together, hitting your thumbs together. And then you go back with the right foot behind
[6653.66s -> 6658.62s]  the back with the fists. I would show you, but I don't have pants on. That person that said that
[6658.62s -> 6667.06s]  was right. All right. I got to find ballerinas. Just, just go to YouTube and type in Pee Wee Herman
[6667.06s -> 6689.37s]  dance. That's you'll find it. How big are these ballerinas? This is kind of like people like this
[6689.37s -> 6695.77s]  or are they smaller or bigger? I, how do I, what am I looking for? Exactly. I know what top left,
[6695.77s -> 6717.98s]  but I accidentally picked one up early. I don't know. Let's focus on getting bigger first.
[6718.78s -> 6736.46s]  This game is fucking fun. But here's the problem though. Make sure you're the first one to do the
[6736.46s -> 6742.47s]  Pee Wee Herman because someone's going to upstage you. You'll know because the second that that song
[6742.47s -> 6746.55s]  comes on, someone's going to put the drink down. They're going to be like, oh fuck, this is time.
[6746.55s -> 6752.79s]  Like, can you hold this for a sec? Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't. No, no,
[6752.79s -> 6756.60s]  I'm not going to hold your drink. And then you go, Hey, hold my drink for somebody else.
[6757.16s -> 6763.16s]  You got to make sure you do it first. Cause if you're the second person to do the Pee Wee Herman
[6763.16s -> 6780.26s]  tequila dance. Ooh, come on. You know, Joe already did that. You got to make sure you're the first
[6780.26s -> 6795.35s]  one. Who's Joe? I don't know. Go put some fucking pants on and show us. You already know what it is.
[6795.35s -> 6801.11s]  You just want me to embarrass myself on his webcam, which I get it. I can understand you.
[6801.11s -> 6807.91s]  I understand where you're coming from. No, no, dude. I don't get it. How does it work?
[6809.96s -> 6829.22s]  Look at this fucking idiot. Okay. I think I'm big enough. This game just became a hidden object
[6829.22s -> 6844.90s]  game and I'm not very good at it. Have you guys seen any so far? How would you do this in under
[6844.90s -> 6873.22s]  two minutes? Oh, right there. This one's weird. What the hell? I'm not big enough.
[6886.28s -> 6910.34s]  Still too small? How am I still too small? I see it. I just can't, I cannot pick up the ballerina
[6910.34s -> 6933.90s]  to get a little bigger. These fishes were just dancing. I just saw the Pee Wee dance. It looks
[6933.90s -> 6959.37s]  like cringe. What do we do with them? You know what I mean? Like what? In mod chat, Pee Wee dance is
[6959.37s -> 6972.57s]  just the first Fortnite dance. It actually is. That's true. Prove them wrong then. Prove them
[6972.57s -> 6982.57s]  wrong. All right. This is only for you. This is only for your guys ears only. The next time that
[6982.57s -> 6992.17s]  I show up on camera, I will do the Pee Wee Herman dance to any music that pops up. And I'm talking
[6992.17s -> 6997.53s]  about, I could be with a bunch of other people. Like I'm doing the Pee Wee dance and the next
[6997.53s -> 7005.69s]  time that I'm on stream, this one or whatever one, if music starts playing and it's danceable music,
[7005.69s -> 7014.54s]  I will do the Pee Wee Herman and see what happens. Okay. Now I can definitely pick people up.
[7014.54s -> 7044.89s]  Okay. There we go. There's two. Probably out of this area. Do you see any? There's one. All right.
[7044.89s -> 7059.37s]  One more. Way too much time on this, by the way. Way too much time. I would avoid the person doing
[7059.37s -> 7068.09s]  the Pee Wee dance. That's all right. It's all right. Me and the buds will be having a grand
[7068.09s -> 7109.14s]  old time. We'll be having a good old time. Where? Where? By where you started? We're going to hold
[7109.14s -> 7150.33s]  you to that. That's fine. No, that's fine. Please hold me to it. Over here? Oh, right here. All
[7150.33s -> 7171.61s]  right. Well, that was so long, but I did it. Okay. As long as me and the buds are having fun.
[7172.41s -> 7195.08s]  Take eight minutes, five minutes. You do you. Okay. So this last one is this one study time.
[7200.70s -> 7206.14s]  Can we please restart the debt arc? The debt arc never came to a conclusion.
[7208.78s -> 7216.30s]  You want some insider info of the debt arc? I tried to close that joke a half a dozen times,
[7216.30s -> 7223.51s]  at least. And I kept failing the bets and kept making the price higher. Trust me, I tried. It's
[7223.51s -> 7227.75s]  like, oh, okay. Oh, a billion off the debt. If I do this and I just wouldn't do it, I would fuck up
[7227.75s -> 7233.75s]  every time. It would never happen. I was always increasing it. Even when I thought I was decreasing
[7233.75s -> 7247.96s]  with something I knew I could do and did now solve the solve it. I'm so glad you stopped talking
[7247.96s -> 7254.84s]  about it. Well, it just got to a point where I kept screwing up, clean up quick. And oh,
[7254.84s -> 7280.98s]  I only have a minute. Minute? How am I going to do this in a minute? Actually, it's not that much.
[7292.28s -> 7319.83s]  I did it, right? Yeah, I got enough. Barely passing. It's still passing.
[7333.22s -> 7346.47s]  Please can I, um, whatever you guys, you guys are on today. You guys are on point today. Cool.
[7347.35s -> 7360.65s]  All right. I want to go do, I want to go do this. Did all these. That was pretty fun. I want to do
[7360.65s -> 7373.29s]  some more of these. Where's the big one? The elephant, right? I have to get that one much
[7373.29s -> 7386.60s]  better. Oh, something new over here. What's new? Is it you? Cousins, second cousins. I want to play
[7386.60s -> 7405.93s]  with them all. Hurry and roll them all up. What do you mean? Get a bunch of cousins? All right.
[7405.93s -> 7424.09s]  Here we are. No, I need them all. Oh, I need them all. Okay. Uh, was it the elephant?
[7424.81s -> 7447.75s]  Where's the elephant? I'm going to use this character. I like that. Where's the elephant?
[7448.47s -> 7461.75s]  What's the Katamari Memorial? Oh, okay. Hey dude, can you do a stream where you fulfill all the
[7461.75s -> 7467.82s]  promises you made in rapid succession? Now that's a really, really, really good idea.
[7469.38s -> 7474.66s]  We have a list of these. Okay. Who's been, somebody's been keeping track of this somehow.
[7474.66s -> 7485.50s]  Okay. Let's go over these. Um, second Catboy stream, Paper Mario, D&D with stir, Mega Milk
[7485.50s -> 7492.60s]  shirt stream, playing neon white sorcery, the monster breeder browser game, iPad stream night,
[7492.60s -> 7497.90s]  M. Dickey stream night, Bionicle building stream, pre-recorded stream, children's entertainment
[7497.90s -> 7506.22s]  stream, remake autos big adventure, yoga stream. Interesting. Hilux two, ace attorney, Tony Hawk's
[7506.22s -> 7514.31s]  underground two, BLT sandwich stream. I thought that said during surgery. It says during sorcery.
[7514.31s -> 7522.82s]  Bugleberry audio book, man versus machine, zoom beanies, Peggle, Pee Wee Herman dance,
[7522.82s -> 7536.38s]  next face cam stream. Not that many. You want me to do each one of those in five minutes?
[7536.38s -> 7555.45s]  I'd get, I would get sick. Battleaxe? Yeah. Don't worry. Hey, hey, off-brand. Hey, chief
[7555.45s -> 7560.47s]  officer of off-brand. You don't think, you don't think a battleaxe will show up at some point?
[7560.47s -> 7578.39s]  Come on. Where's the elephant? How come the elephant's not here? You passed it already?
[7578.39s -> 7594.92s]  How did I not see an elephant? How do you miss an elephant? It's called the screen is showing
[7594.92s -> 7600.98s]  lights and colors at me, but information is not being processed. I am just up here in my head.
[7601.70s -> 7606.58s]  Nothing else is going on there. The screen is just colors and lights. There's nothing on it.
[7607.93s -> 7612.89s]  When I start talking and we just haven't just looking at chat and stuff. All right. Let me
[7612.89s -> 7633.93s]  try to make this one big. I want to get this one done right. I'll do it right. There's no way you're
[7634.01s -> 7653.51s]  dodging a battleaxe. You can think that's fine. A thousand meters. Oh shit. Okay.
[7668.97s -> 7686.09s]  Play last of us. Oh, I feel like I've missed. I missed that big time. Why are you just skipping
[7686.09s -> 7713.91s]  over the laugh? What laugh? What laugh? The mouse have to scream. There we go.
[7713.91s -> 7725.69s]  Oh, we can talk. It's still just three meters. You're going for a thousand. Well,
[7725.69s -> 7730.01s]  with such a long way to go, how about having some fun with the rolling? Like roll backwards
[7730.01s -> 7734.49s]  the rest of the way, but trying a roller too with your eyes closed. Of course there's no
[7734.49s -> 7748.30s]  benefit whatsoever, but it could be kind of fun. Maybe. Get over here now. I never played stray.
[7748.30s -> 7775.02s]  I know I didn't. I'm not ready to go that way yet. You unironically promised paper Mario
[7775.02s -> 7820.28s]  thousand year door back in 2017. Okay. Well, I'm going this way. You also said you're going to
[7820.28s -> 7825.40s]  play arc two when it came out. No, I did not. You, that's reaching. You are reaching really
[7825.40s -> 7830.78s]  far into the memory bank here. No, I never said that. When did I say I was going to play arc two?
[7838.68s -> 7842.52s]  Get the clip. Get the clip. There is no clip of me saying, yeah, man, I'm really excited to play
[7842.52s -> 7849.16s]  arc two. I don't, I don't think that's ever came out. That sentence has never been formed out of
[7849.16s -> 7873.56s]  my mouth. I definitely didn't say it. Careful. You never played the Barbie horse adventure game
[7873.56s -> 7882.44s]  either. Yeah, but you got to give me a little, give me a little bit of slack here. Here's how
[7882.44s -> 7898.33s]  many video games exist ever? There's a lot. There's a lot of them. Are there more than 500,000 video
[7898.33s -> 7906.60s]  games that have released? I made just about a thousand YouTube videos before I started really
[7906.60s -> 7917.26s]  streaming on Twitch and I've streamed like what, like two or three thousand times. Like at least
[7917.26s -> 7923.82s]  a couple of thousand times. That means I've only played like 3% of 5% of every, every video game
[7923.82s -> 7947.67s]  that exists. What is this shit? He's laughing already. What's even funny? I really am Beavis
[7947.67s -> 7956.60s]  and Butthead combined as one person. What are you talking about? Two Vin Diesel is the character.
[7956.60s -> 7962.70s]  I don't understand what we're watching here. That was a fan fiction. Like they made that.
[7965.42s -> 7971.48s]  Somebody made that in Blender. What? I didn't say I was going to play it.
[7973.14s -> 7976.98s]  I have to play that day one. Well, you're an idiot for saying that.
[7986.70s -> 7994.71s]  People pulling out these receipts. So Grump Clump, you said you were going to play Billy Hatcher and
[7994.71s -> 8004.54s]  the Giant Egg. It looks fun. I'll add it to the list when slash if a GameCube night comes back.
[8004.54s -> 8021.43s]  This is a year ago. You should do an ice cream making stream. That sounds actually really cool.
[8021.43s -> 8035.96s]  I like that idea. Thank you. I got it. Don't happen again. I'll try. Jesus. Settle the fuck down.
[8050.25s -> 8056.50s]  I could read you guys the list of games that I have and it dates years back and some of
[8056.50s -> 8063.13s]  the stuff I just have never opened. That sounds fun. Put it on this list and then I never open it.
[8068.34s -> 8074.82s]  One day we'll also have to go over the retirement retirement. I definitely want to go over with you
[8074.82s -> 8081.90s]  guys all the ideas that I wish I could have done. I just didn't and we'll just kind of go over them
[8081.90s -> 8087.26s]  and rank them on a tier list of what you guys think would have been the best one and I'll do
[8087.26s -> 8095.35s]  that one. Do you know what I mean? We'll go over the, I'll open my fucking notebook. We could go
[8095.35s -> 8101.99s]  over like the 30 different stream ideas that I've wanted to do and we'll rank them and then I'll do
[8101.99s -> 8123.22s]  it. I'll do the one that's the highest rank. You're streaming until you drop dead. Okay.
[8127.56s -> 8147.70s]  You fucking maniac. You're streaming until you drop dead. No, I have an idea. I know what I'm
[8147.70s -> 8154.34s]  doing for the retirement stream. Oh, I know. It's been, I've had it ready. It's been up here. I know
[8154.34s -> 8172.01s]  exactly what it is. It's going to be humorous. It makes me laugh. It makes me laugh every time
[8173.24s -> 8179.22s]  because I don't know. It's kind of, it's kind of like fucked up, but whatever. Not really,
[8179.22s -> 8192.70s]  but it is. It's just, I think it makes me laugh. So I don't care. I want to tell you one of the
[8192.70s -> 8197.18s]  jokes so bad, but if I do actually go through with this and it'll be worth it. You just not
[8197.18s -> 8207.11s]  and just waiting till whenever that happens. It's kind of fun to just relaxingly play this game.
[8207.11s -> 8216.74s]  Just like roll over stuff and get bigger. This is fun. I like this one. Yeah. No, I'll show the
[8216.74s -> 8225.82s]  Aaron fart video before I retire. I promise. I'll release all of my draft tweets. No, I will
[8234.06s -> 8236.14s]  stop making promises. You're not going to keep any of these.
[8254.90s -> 8262.30s]  We talk about candy or something instead. No, don't worry. Don't worry.
[8272.34s -> 8274.90s]  You're going to dig in your grave here by making all these promises.
[8289.34s -> 8297.03s]  How's your talkie addiction going? Oh, actually. So here's a funny little story.
[8298.15s -> 8308.95s]  I started drinking beet juice and I like, I don't want to say like 12 hours later.
[8310.54s -> 8321.66s]  Beet juice. E as in Barry. E as in Barry. E-A-T. Beet. No, B-E-E-T. E. How many E's?
[8322.70s -> 8325.90s]  Chief creative officer of off-brand. How are you? Good. Nice to meet you.
[8325.90s -> 8336.63s]  Take my hand. There you are. Yeah. How do you spell beets? I don't know. B-E-E-T.
[8337.51s -> 8352.41s]  B-E-E-T juice. Not meat as in M as in Mary. OK, the whole punchline with this is I peed
[8353.05s -> 8358.82s]  bright red and I thought I pissed blood and I freaked out and I thought it was the talkies
[8358.82s -> 8364.50s]  that I ate. I was like, no, can't we ask me the talkies? Talkies are red. But no,
[8366.42s -> 8374.18s]  I did not know this. Apparently some people, like 20% of the population, if you drink beet juice,
[8374.26s -> 8389.18s]  or if you eat B-E-E-T-S, you pee red. No, you don't. If you drink beet juice, your pee is red.
[8398.94s -> 8411.37s]  Weird. Somebody lied to you? No, they did not. Because every time I've drank beet juice,
[8412.17s -> 8416.65s]  a day later, I have a full red piss. Like, well, that's a lie. It's like pink.
[8418.04s -> 8420.52s]  I'm embellishing because I'm a fucking live streamer and that's all we do.
[8421.56s -> 8444.06s]  You are fucked up. I'm really not. I think I just eat some beets and then tell me how you feel.
[8444.86s -> 8448.98s]  Probably will feel pretty good because they're really good for you. It kind of tastes like
[8448.98s -> 8477.32s]  dirt though. I think I can get a lot of these buildings here now because it tastes like goat
[8477.32s -> 8483.66s]  cheese. It's in that same world of goat cheese flavor, where it has that kind of very soil-y
[8484.38s -> 8500.66s]  dirt. It's kind of like dirt. Name five historical landmarks on this map.
[8502.87s -> 8524.33s]  Taj Mahal, Great Wall of China, Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and the Leaning Tower of
[8524.97s -> 8574.14s]  Pisa. And then, Big London. Oh, I love this no time limit routine. That's great.
[8575.02s -> 8600.01s]  Big London is the name of the bell. Cool. Have you ever really gotten mad at chat before?
[8600.89s -> 8610.18s]  Oh, yes. Yes, it has happened. I have been screaming for like seven years.
[8610.98s -> 8615.86s]  Yes, there's been at least one or two times where I've been like, what the fuck are they saying?
[8616.82s -> 8650.07s]  Do they know? It's had to have happened at least once. Getting there. When we're full of
[8650.07s -> 8671.88s]  contrarian Andes, he gets sassy. Can I get? Nope, not yet. You spent two minutes mocking
[8671.88s -> 8675.96s]  me one time because I said that one of the nerds in Sam and Max sounded like you.
[8680.14s -> 8690.07s]  Um, okay. But we're, this is a two-way street. It's not like, oh yeah, remember that time that
[8690.07s -> 8696.47s]  Jerma got, yeah, yeah, Jerma gets mad at chat all the time. Remember the time that we raided him
[8697.35s -> 8702.41s]  until he fucking got angry at us? You're leaving out a very important part.
[8703.45s -> 8710.84s]  Yeah, I remember that time that Jerma got really upset. Yeah, it was weird. I just said his hair
[8710.84s -> 8717.80s]  looked like shit and he smelled like yellow M&Ms. And that I think that he, his eyes,
[8718.76s -> 8723.32s]  his eyes are too close together. That's all I, I don't, why did he get mad at us?
[8723.32s -> 8727.08s]  Why did he say? I don't understand. Why was he so upset with us today?
[8728.28s -> 8749.19s]  What's the maddest you've ever been on stream? I don't know. I'm trying to think of some real
[8749.19s -> 8759.26s]  genuine moments where I was actually really, really unhappy. They're very far, few and far between
[8760.14s -> 8766.46s]  because I mean, all right, no more jokes. Let's be real. I treat this stream. I mean, like the
[8766.46s -> 8771.58s]  whole point of this stream is kind of just fucking around. I just like having fun. It's
[8771.58s -> 8780.20s]  fun to mess around with a bunch of people. It's fun. I don't take what I'm doing here.
[8781.88s -> 8786.95s]  Well, I do take it serious. I take fucking around really seriously. Does that make sense?
[8789.54s -> 8799.58s]  I take messing around really seriously. But besides that, I just treat this as like a
[8799.58s -> 8805.88s]  fun space where I'm not really, I know that we're all kind of messing around for the most part.
[8805.88s -> 8812.81s]  So yeah, sometimes somebody comes in and just like, oh, this guy's a dickhead. And it's like,
[8812.81s -> 8824.30s]  okay, whatever. But like 99.9% of the time, it's just like, it doesn't bother me. And I know people
[8824.30s -> 8849.90s]  just have fun. I'm going to assume this person's accusing me of being bald. Let's see. What did
[8849.90s -> 8860.14s]  you say? Be honest. Is this the reason why you haven't had a face cam on? Oh, wait, what? Oh,
[8860.14s -> 8863.10s]  I thought you were going to say, be honest. Do you have not have a face cam on because you're bald,
[8863.10s -> 8885.69s]  that you don't want to show anybody? No. But the answer to that. Self-reporting? Yeah. It's
[8885.69s -> 8896.81s]  going to happen. I wonder, when I do start to really show, when I start to show that I'm going
[8896.81s -> 8901.54s]  bald, which I don't think I'm going to, I don't think it's really going to happen, but what do
[8901.62s -> 8910.10s]  you think is going to be more important to the community? Bald guy or short guy? That's a
[8910.10s -> 8918.84s]  conundrum. I wonder, I wonder how, how you guys are going to take it. Will it always be like,
[8918.84s -> 8923.32s]  oh, he's like kind of short or will it be bald bald? He's bald guy. Bald would be fresh.
[8924.68s -> 8930.70s]  Why can't you be bald and short? Maybe you're going to, you know, you're going to pick one.
[8930.70s -> 8944.26s]  I know you. I know you. When I turn the webcam on and I'm bald for the first time or like balding,
[8944.26s -> 8949.70s]  you're just going to write bald. You're not going to write short and bald. No, no, no,
[8949.70s -> 8960.68s]  that's far too much. You're just going to write bald. That's it. I'm going to make it really hard
[8960.68s -> 8965.62s]  for you. I'm going to, I'm going to stand next to like a measurement tool that says like five,
[8965.62s -> 8992.06s]  five on it, but I'm going to be balding for real. Thank you, George. Yeah. I don't even care.
[8995.80s -> 9013.37s]  I don't even care. Said by the person that very much does. He's crying. I don't actually care.
[9014.01s -> 9021.85s]  I'm very confident. I'm very confident in who I am. I'm, I'm who I am. I don't care.
[9023.86s -> 9030.26s]  I'm super quick. I'm very, very, I can have explosive energy. I can fit in a lot of really,
[9030.82s -> 9034.82s]  I can fit in a lot of spaces that normally, you know, a lot of big tall people can't fit in.
[9034.82s -> 9084.58s]  I don't give a shit. And nevermind. And what? And what? There is no and 20 minutes. Well,
[9084.58s -> 9095.42s]  this isn't relaxing. Hey, what's the point of this game is to be, nope. Oh, brand awareness.
[9097.94s -> 9118.46s]  No, we're going to have a lot of fun. I can't wait till the first company meeting where me
[9118.46s -> 9142.10s]  and stands have a friend ending argument. And he throws a coffee in my face. No,
[9143.14s -> 9149.67s]  we've already talked a bunch of times and I think we're all kind of laser focused on trying to be
[9150.55s -> 9159.13s]  trying to make us go to stuff as we can and have fun doing it. The group is very much
[9160.01s -> 9179.96s]  on the same page completely. Yep. I know I don't want to keep, you know, I mean, obviously I do
[9179.96s -> 9185.74s]  want to keep reiterating it, but for people that weren't here at the beginning, uh, yeah, I've,
[9185.74s -> 9193.11s]  I am now officially an employee of off brand as the chief creative officer of the company.
[9193.11s -> 9218.26s]  Can I keep going? Oh, I didn't get to roll up everything. Finally got a job. That's right.
[9221.83s -> 9234.02s]  I'm looking forward to it. Yep. Again, I'll make it clear. The role that I'm going to have in off
[9234.02s -> 9239.30s]  brand is to be essentially creative director of most of the stuff that comes through.
[9240.26s -> 9245.61s]  So if you have a show and you want to do it through off brand, we're probably going to talk
[9246.65s -> 9256.65s]  extensively to develop out some of those things. So essentially it's like a, it's like a creative
[9256.65s -> 9288.04s]  director of the company. That was fun. Are you going to give ideas or just help other ideas
[9288.04s -> 9294.47s]  happen? I think it's kind of going to be everything. A little bit of everything.
[9296.58s -> 9300.66s]  If I have something that I think I could add or that I want to do that I think would be great,
[9300.66s -> 9307.80s]  maybe there's people that would want to do it. Help develop somebody else's idea.
[9308.52s -> 9317.10s]  That sounds really fun to me. That's nice. I would do that to write up my alley land of mystery,
[9317.10s -> 9332.68s]  small bang. And also working very closely with the production team. I, my responsibilities will
[9332.68s -> 9340.38s]  probably develop a lot over the coming period, but I'm imagining it'll probably play out something
[9340.38s -> 9349.50s]  like how I do it for my own shows. I write a bunch of stuff. I say, Hey, I want it like this.
[9349.50s -> 9352.54s]  I want it to be like that and like that. And it should be like this. And here's like the whole
[9352.54s -> 9358.76s]  document of how I want it to go. And we take that to production. We see how it can fit in,
[9358.76s -> 9365.82s]  go back and forth a lot. It's essentially just sort of the, the, a lot of writing, a lot of
[9365.82s -> 9374.63s]  a kind of onsite direction, I think too, which is what I like to do. That's where I hope to be.
[9374.71s -> 9381.94s]  Are you just an ideas guy? No, no, I'm going to be like on site for a lot of these shows.
[9383.29s -> 9389.05s]  And I'll be writing probably a very large portion of a lot of stuff that we're working on, I imagine.
[9390.52s -> 9395.66s]  So no, but it's, it is that too. It's kind of everything that you're describing that I'm
[9395.66s -> 9408.36s]  describing. Oh, he's a writer now. You can have it. I can't ever tell anybody I'm a writer.
[9408.36s -> 9424.31s]  I just can't. I'm because I'm not. Did I beat everything? I think we're done. He's going to be
[9424.31s -> 9429.16s]  an on the scene e-clown. I'm going to walk over there and be like, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[9429.16s -> 9435.26s]  wait, hold on a second. That was, you need to say it with a little more oomph, a little more oomph.
[9435.26s -> 9442.50s]  You need to squeeze your nose afterwards. Like there's no, we don't have a clown nose in this
[9442.50s -> 9457.14s]  scene. Why not? How could there not be a clown noise in every scene? Do you worry that you'll
[9457.14s -> 9462.10s]  be so busy with projects that you'll run out of creative steam and won't be able to work on your
[9462.10s -> 9468.50s]  own stuff? No, I don't think so. Because my own stuff at this point is going to probably be,
[9469.14s -> 9489.38s]  is off-brand. That's a lot of the point, I think. You're only 45% finished. What do you got? What's
[9489.38s -> 9512.70s]  this one again? They all have alternate versions, right? So it's also, so it's just a change in
[9512.70s -> 9519.53s]  focus in terms of where stuff like baseball stream will be coming from. I think it's both focus and
[9520.73s -> 9527.88s]  sort of the evolution of where I really wanted to be. This is something I've always wanted to do.
[9528.52s -> 9539.54s]  And I can continue to stream and still do this stuff. Working on a show and working on a project
[9539.54s -> 9544.10s]  or something and doing all these things with off-brand is, it's going to take up a significant
[9544.10s -> 9552.82s]  amount of time, but not all of my time. So I still can do this too, sort of in an evolved way where
[9552.82s -> 9559.98s]  I'm putting time here and putting time over there, putting time here. Because I genuinely love doing
[9559.98s -> 9571.43s]  this. I love to stream. It's fun. It's a lot of fun. In the mod chat there's a comment that says
[9571.43s -> 9576.23s]  I need to respond to this. Okay. Jerma, will you ever have to for when you are going to in the
[9576.23s -> 9584.95s]  future, will you be able to wanting to have that or no? I don't think so. I think what matters is
[9584.95s -> 9592.04s]  how I feel about what you're describing. And I think how I feel about it is I feel like this is
[9592.04s -> 9599.66s]  just the natural way that I would have done it anyways. What a really good question. What a really
[9599.66s -> 9617.43s]  good comment. Use your left and right. Wait, this is the tutorial. Wait, how come I'm doing
[9617.43s -> 9637.75s]  the tutorial again? Is there a reason why I'm here? That guy was the tutorial. I thought he
[9637.75s -> 9656.97s]  had a different mission for me. Jeez. Oh, I want to do another car one. That sounds fun.
[9666.23s -> 9683.42s]  I played this yesterday. It's a good game. You can fly now beyond. What? You want to roll up cars?
[9684.38s -> 9692.33s]  I've also talked to other streamers and YouTubers over the past year or two and just been like,
[9692.41s -> 9703.05s]  you know, we should work together. We should do some stuff together. And now this is my job now
[9703.05s -> 9709.86s]  is to do that. So I'm really hopeful and excited that anybody that I've really talked to over the
[9709.86s -> 9716.10s]  years of like, hey, we should do something like, oh, yeah, we should. Okay. Well, let's do it.
[9716.10s -> 9735.70s]  Let's do something because it's really easy to get into that mindset where, oh, yeah, we'll do
[9735.70s -> 9741.30s]  something. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And it's like, I'm like, I got my own shit going on. And I something else
[9741.30s -> 9746.54s]  happened. And yeah, maybe some baby. Well, maybe one day. Yeah. No, well, let's just do it. Let's
[9746.54s -> 9758.10s]  do it. My job here going forward is to make sure I follow up on those things. Because that's the
[9758.10s -> 9776.76s]  point now. But yeah, I want all those. Oh, this one. Oh, that's right. This one has all forward
[9776.76s -> 9814.58s]  momentum. I can't stop. What does that sound? I want there is your favorite cousin.
[9818.86s -> 9842.98s]  The ball tennis ball. I think I did pretty good there. Two minutes and 16 seconds.
[9842.98s -> 9856.06s]  Yeah. That's pretty cool. Oh, shit. That's right. So we're talking about are you still eating
[9856.06s -> 9863.08s]  Takis? I thought the Takis is what made me read. And I looked it up. It was the beats all along.
[9863.96s -> 9877.83s]  Oh, they actually like it this time. You like it. Oh, got a good score.
[9901.21s -> 9910.38s]  No more salad. When are we doing the final fantasy 16 stuff? Um, just whenever. Whenever I feel like
[9910.38s -> 9917.78s]  switching over to it. So it's just the demo. I think we're also going to watch one of the
[9917.78s -> 9928.84s]  trailers for the game, too. But I am actually I'm very curious if I like this or not, because
[9928.84s -> 9932.84s]  Final Fantasy is I never really got into very much Final Fantasy, by the way, Chrono Trigger
[9932.84s -> 9936.84s]  and Chrono Cross, the most important media in human history. It's up there.
[9938.20s -> 9944.02s]  But Final Fantasy has been something I haven't really paid that much attention to for,
[9944.02s -> 9948.82s]  I want to say, since like, I don't think I see 10 on a fantasy six or something.
[9949.54s -> 9965.77s]  Well, I'm going to do one more level and we'll switch over. Chrono Cross is mediocre.
[9965.77s -> 9978.06s]  I agree. I agree. But I will tell you Chrono Cross is soundtrack carries that entire game.
[9978.06s -> 9992.71s]  The Chrono Cross soundtrack is is so good that I can handle the kind of kind of wild kind of
[9992.71s -> 9996.87s]  convoluted storyline. And don't put spoilers, please, because a lot of people don't know what
[9996.87s -> 10003.05s]  I'm talking about. But if you know, you know, it's kind of messy. You needed to experience
[10003.05s -> 10009.13s]  a text based adventure game before playing Chrono Cross to get the actual story of how the game
[10009.69s -> 10026.60s]  worked. So talk to that dog. I did before, didn't I? Another nice day. Didn't I already do the sun?
[10031.38s -> 10035.62s]  But Chrono Cross's soundtrack carries the whole game, except for the battle music,
[10035.62s -> 10044.82s]  which is unfortunate because you hear the battle music more than anything else.
[10044.82s -> 10048.82s]  You really rolled it up. You rolled up the sun really and truly. Oh, we are impressed.
[10049.62s -> 10059.22s]  We have a dog among our fans. One more time. One more time? I can't say no. Do it till the end.
[10059.22s -> 10072.79s]  Do only this. The battle music is OK. It has no lasting power at all.
[10073.51s -> 10085.99s]  I think it's just kind of the tempo is sort of out of whack with the game. It's just like that.
[10089.99s -> 10092.79s]  Oh, my God. I just get the shit out of myself without somebody in my room.
[10097.88s -> 10102.81s]  I was hitting my desk and something fell off the desk to the left and fell down.
[10103.37s -> 10106.97s]  And I was like, oh, shit, there's something in here. I thought there was an animal in my room.
[10112.26s -> 10122.62s]  Sorry. That fucking sound from Devil May Cry, I swear, has permanently fucked me up.
[10122.62s -> 10150.60s]  Prey instincts. Corn nuts. Yeah. But what I was trying to say is
[10155.50s -> 10159.50s]  this is too fast for battle music. This is too fast for battle music.
[10160.30s -> 10164.14s]  Let's go to the other one. Let's go to Chrono Trigger. Ready? You hear the tempo?
[10171.18s -> 10177.86s]  Here's that. You hear that, right? That's proper tempo.
[10177.86s -> 10185.40s]  I think that Chrono Cross's tempo of it's just like it's too slow down too much.
[10185.40s -> 10211.06s]  There's a lot more planets here. What about Doom Eternal?
[10211.06s -> 10224.34s]  Doom Eternal is not a turn based RPG. Oh, what did I get? Pega and Altair?
[10225.22s -> 10250.34s]  Those cousins. He doesn't know the stars. Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.
[10251.06s -> 10276.41s]  Orion. Capricorn. Icee's. Big Dipper. The Little Dipper.
[10277.21s -> 10289.19s]  I'm a big fan of the Little Dipper, by the way. The Little Dipper is, you can see the,
[10289.19s -> 10294.79s]  I can make out the Little Dipper before anything else. What kind of food do you think they ate
[10294.79s -> 10322.50s]  there? Did you watch the Starfield presentation? No, I have not seen a single clip from any of the
[10322.50s -> 10335.30s]  summer game stuff. I don't even know what got announced. I got everything right.
[10335.30s -> 10344.57s]  I'm not going to pick up every single star. Elden Ring DLC trailer? No, no, sorry. I have an alert
[10344.57s -> 10349.77s]  on my phone that will ping me the moment that happens. So I'm sorry. I would have been the
[10349.77s -> 10367.72s]  first. I would have been the first person to tell you that. Every single morning I wake up and I
[10367.72s -> 10390.06s]  just refresh the Elden Ring YouTube official page at 6 a.m. But what if the announcement drops at
[10390.06s -> 10406.25s]  8 a.m.? No, then I just won't see it till tomorrow. All right, so now I will try not to lose in the
[10406.25s -> 10411.48s]  credits. And then we'll move on just to give you those of you that know it's going to be a sponsor
[10411.48s -> 10415.32s]  segment. We're going to chill. We're going to just hang out with the demo of Final Fantasy 16. We're
[10415.32s -> 10420.76s]  going to watch a trailer and we're just going to fucking hang out. If you want to join us, please
[10420.76s -> 10425.48s]  stick around. If you don't, then we'll see you at some point soon. Thanks for playing. Thanks for
[10425.48s -> 10434.18s]  hanging out. Final Fantasy 16 coming up. All right, I'm not going to get hit by the ping this time.
[10442.14s -> 10448.46s]  Try the lies of P demo. I actually saw Charlie playing that for a little while.
[10448.46s -> 10468.20s]  It actually looks fun. It's actually good. It is good. I'll definitely try it. I mean,
[10468.20s -> 10474.06s]  when does it come out? Maybe I won't play the demo. Probably just wait till it launches.
[10474.70s -> 10491.94s]  Probably this summer, right? Yeah, September. I can wait. Okay, I have to be careful now.
[10499.14s -> 10517.26s]  Everything is coming out in September. Yeah. What about Trey Pang 2 when it launches?
[10518.22s -> 10525.35s]  Oh, some of those Steam demo best things are coming out now, aren't they?
[10532.23s -> 10533.94s]  Okay, I'm not going to mess it up.
[10546.90s -> 10550.82s]  I'm going to turn it up. I'm going to turn the volume up because it's like a
[10551.46s -> 10556.94s]  big crescendo of the song. Here we go.
[10573.50s -> 10580.14s]  Oh,
[10580.14s -> 10583.27s]  shit.
[10605.38s -> 10626.73s]  Oh, no. I thought it was high enough. I was going to say why is this character not in
[10626.73s -> 10637.29s]  Smash Brothers? I thought there was room above. All right. Well, we got at least the first verse.
[10637.29s -> 10659.67s]  That's all right. We got through the first verse. Do better. Time to play Final Fantasy.
[10661.13s -> 10667.54s]  Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy. All right, let's move to Final Fantasy. It's been like three hours.
[10668.10s -> 10671.38s]  This is what I kind of planned on streaming for like three-ish hours and then move.
[10672.10s -> 10686.17s]  To Final Fantasy. I'm going in. You look like Richard Lewis. All right. Cool. Cool.
[10688.02s -> 10709.30s]  Hell, yeah. That's kind of cool. Save the game. No, I'm probably never going to play Cyberpunk.
[10709.30s -> 10715.74s]  All right. Let me take a quick break. I will come back. We will start the Final Fantasy 16
[10715.74s -> 10726.65s]  hangout sesh. I'm going to watch the trailer first and then we'll play it. So again, this is
[10726.65s -> 10730.89s]  going to be we're going to slow it down. This is going to be kind of just a chill part of the stream
[10731.64s -> 10739.46s]  because it is the demo. The demo is also available right now if you want to play.
[10739.46s -> 10749.86s]  I'll be right fucking back before I do. Let me just make sure this is ready.
[10749.86s -> 10769.10s]  I'll check it real quick. Yeah, make sure this is good. Yep. Oh, by the way, I got a PS5 now.
[10769.10s -> 10777.51s]  So that means also I can play the Demon's Souls remaster remake. It only took me like two years
[10777.51s -> 10784.74s]  to get one. So I'm excited about that. All right. I'll be right back.
[10786.71s -> 10790.28s]  Going to take me probably like a few minutes maybe. I'm just going to set up a couple of
[10790.28s -> 10794.50s]  things. There's a nightbot timer. Give me a minute. I'll be right back. Bye bye.
