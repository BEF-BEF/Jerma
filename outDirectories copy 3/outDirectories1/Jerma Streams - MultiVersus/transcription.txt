[2.68s -> 11.83s]  How you doing? What's happening? How you been? Good?
[11.83s -> 16.60s]  Please play with Steven Universe. I'm sorry, no.
[16.60s -> 20.94s]  I don't have anything against Steven Universe. It just...
[20.94s -> 24.79s]  Tasmanian Devil is a selectable character, so
[24.79s -> 28.07s]  that's who I'm going to play with.
[28.07s -> 31.67s]  And by the way, where's Daffy? I just want to get that out of the way. Where
[31.67s -> 35.11s]  is he? I think there's probably a bug in my game.
[35.11s -> 40.15s]  Some kind of a... probably a data that I had verify integrity of game cache. I
[40.15s -> 45.05s]  don't see Daffy Duck as a selectable character.
[45.05s -> 51.53s]  I'm not sure what's going on in my game, but... So what are we doing?
[51.53s -> 56.22s]  We're going to play multi-versus. I got access to the Alpha,
[56.22s -> 61.00s]  or whatever this is, the early access of it. It ends
[61.00s -> 66.84s]  in about two hours, so I want to check it out for a couple hours and
[66.84s -> 75.77s]  see how it is. Daffy Duck got fired from WB.
[76.01s -> 81.16s]  You don't fire a cartoon character? What? Nice milk voice?
[81.16s -> 83.88s]  Why do I know what you're talking about? I hate that I know what you're talking
[83.88s -> 94.20s]  about. Nice milk voice. Is it though? Is it... I mean,
[94.20s -> 105.35s]  maybe a little bit milky, but... What did this person say?
[105.35s -> 108.39s]  I got immediately used to the new mic. It sounds neat now.
[108.39s -> 114.25s]  Oh cool, thanks. Just to let you know, I haven't...
[114.25s -> 117.69s]  I haven't fixed anything with this mic. Anything, since the first time you heard
[117.77s -> 122.22s]  me use it during the horror games. I kind of sat down and opened up the
[122.22s -> 127.26s]  compressor and just got... I was just like, I don't care.
[127.26s -> 133.03s]  And then I said, I'll fix it later. It's not laziness.
[133.03s -> 139.05s]  It's not laziness. It's almost like a disdain for having to do it,
[139.05s -> 143.14s]  because there's so many little knobs I have to
[143.14s -> 146.66s]  twist and stuff, and move, and drag, and sliders, and
[147.06s -> 149.94s]  the attack, and the release time, and I'm just like, I don't fucking, I don't care
[149.94s -> 155.40s]  right now. I think it's okay. So it's laziness.
[155.40s -> 158.36s]  No, it's a disdain for needing to have to do it in the first place. It's not
[158.36s -> 164.20s]  laziness. Tweaking audio is the worst. Okay, you know
[164.20s -> 167.64s]  what it is? I set the whole thing up, and it took me like an hour or two to
[167.64s -> 170.12s]  get this where I want it, and what I want it to be like.
[170.12s -> 173.00s]  And then I got to mess with a bunch of knobs after messing with the knobs, and
[173.00s -> 176.47s]  then the knobs weren't in the right place. I'm just like, you know what?
[176.47s -> 182.12s]  I'll do it eventually. I'll figure it out. So don't worry.
[182.12s -> 191.74s]  He's lazy. Next person. We're playing multiverses, and you need to stop.
[191.74s -> 203.54s]  It's disdained laziness. But how you doing? Hope everyone's
[203.54s -> 211.54s]  all right. Hope you're having a good day. My day is going pretty well. I think it's
[211.54s -> 216.50s]  time that we moved over. By the way, after this, because I gotta
[216.50s -> 219.70s]  get going. We gotta go, because I only have until 5 p.m. Pacific.
[219.70s -> 225.88s]  Did I watch Obi-Wan Kenobi? No, I didn't. I own almost every Star Wars shirt that
[225.88s -> 231.58s]  they've released in the last four or five years, but I've only seen
[231.58s -> 236.30s]  the goddamn milk voice. That's the only one I've seen. I've seen the only
[236.30s -> 246.46s]  the new one. The new movie. I haven't seen any of the new shows really.
[246.46s -> 251.42s]  He's in Fortnite now. I know, right? Yeah. Do a watch party? I'm not going to do a
[251.42s -> 254.62s]  watch party. All right, so anyways, after this, there's a few games that I want to
[254.62s -> 259.96s]  play. It's going to be a mystery game, so hope you're ready.
[259.96s -> 268.52s]  So let's go. You guys ready? What's up? And because we're playing, it's
[268.52s -> 273.21s]  Warner Brothers. Hold on, let me make sure. Do I have a fly down?
[273.21s -> 283.14s]  Did you shave? Yeah, I did. But because it's a Warner Brothers game, I decided I
[283.14s -> 291.30s]  was gonna wear Aquaman. The shirt is so tight now. I don't think this shirt ever
[291.30s -> 295.75s]  fit me. This is a classic shirt, but I don't think it ever fit me for real.
[295.75s -> 298.87s]  And now I've gained probably like another 10 pounds or so, and it's
[298.87s -> 305.05s]  it definitely doesn't fit at all. It's very, very tight. You outgrew your kids'
[305.05s -> 310.33s]  clothes. And I gotta get a haircut too. I don't like what my hair looks like
[310.33s -> 314.39s]  today. Okay, you guys ready? Look at it. It's all
[314.39s -> 322.65s]  fucked up. It's all bunched up over here. I got to slick it back.
[322.65s -> 326.86s]  That looks okay. Not really, but whatever. You look like a vampire. Whatever.
[326.86s -> 331.74s]  All right, so here we go. We're gonna play... Who should I play with
[331.74s -> 336.26s]  first? I did the basic tutorial. It just plays just like Smash Brothers, except
[336.26s -> 345.34s]  it's pretty much 2v2, right? So let's go. Let me just do 1v1. This is
[345.34s -> 349.85s]  the teams. Let me just do 1v1. Let me just try it for now.
[349.85s -> 353.78s]  Should I play online already? What if I don't know what the fuck I'm doing?
[353.78s -> 364.76s]  Can you guys hear it? I should be able to hear it now. All right, 1v1.
[364.76s -> 372.63s]  Choose one. Okay, let's go. Cross play. That's fine. All right, should I be
[372.63s -> 381.18s]  Shaggy? Shaggy's a bruiser. Rain Dog. Who is Rain Dog? There's no
[381.18s -> 385.43s]  background music. Oh, it's because I turned on the streamer mode, so it
[385.43s -> 392.38s]  removes, I think, everything. Bugs Bunny. I was looking at
[392.38s -> 399.59s]  Tasmanian Devil. I'm gonna do Taz. Experimental. All right,
[399.59s -> 404.60s]  Summertime Taz. I don't... I can't... I don't have that yet. Is the game good?
[404.60s -> 416.23s]  What is all this for? Oh, what's this? Oh, dude, Hustle Town game!
[416.23s -> 419.75s]  I looked like a fucking... I was made out of taffy for a second. When I
[419.75s -> 422.23s]  leaned into the mic, I looked over here and I looked like I was made out of
[422.23s -> 429.75s]  fucking clay. It was weird. Alanna's to always...
[429.75s -> 440.31s]  All right, let's go. My mic cut that off. What did you hear?
[440.31s -> 445.00s]  The mic cut you off. You didn't hear me say, oh my god, Chalky Arian!
[445.00s -> 451.30s]  Oh, Aria Stark! What are perks? I don't care.
[451.30s -> 458.49s]  It's called... Do I have to pick a perk? I don't have any perks.
[458.57s -> 461.13s]  Onion... Onion Stark.
[461.13s -> 465.69s]  Taz, Onion Stark! This is fucking loud.
[465.69s -> 473.74s]  All right, let's go. No perks, no perks. I don't even know what's going on.
[473.74s -> 480.97s]  It's the first time I've ever played this. First to get two ringouts wins.
[480.97s -> 484.33s]  I have no intention of letting someone else be the victor. I was like, that's not
[484.33s -> 499.94s]  Taz. Why are we playing on this stage? All right, so you got the bite.
[499.94s -> 510.71s]  All right, what's that? Attack down. Oh, burp!
[510.71s -> 523.58s]  Oh, you got... I got Salt and Pepper too. Oh, shit! All right, that's what I can do.
[523.90s -> 555.77s]  Oh! Oh! Oh my god!
[555.77s -> 559.29s]  Why am I a turkey? Oh, no, that's not me. That's her.
[583.98s -> 586.28s]  Oops.
[600.68s -> 616.28s]  This is fun. This is fun. This is actually pretty fun. This is fun.
[616.28s -> 618.44s]  There's no music. Why is there no music?
[626.44s -> 631.59s]  No, I... Let me go to the music section. Good fight. That was actually pretty fun.
[632.95s -> 636.65s]  Let me... Let me... Hold on a second here. Oh, let's give a toast.
[639.22s -> 644.49s]  I toasted. Okay. Oh, all right. All right, let me tell you something right now.
[645.45s -> 650.74s]  Let's put the OST. Put on Looney Tunes music. It's on streamer mode. Oh, I'll fix it.
[651.78s -> 661.03s]  Excuse me, though. This runs fucking unbelievable. The problem that I always have, and I'm not
[661.03s -> 669.86s]  fucking around. I'm not making this up. Input delay and lag in an online match is unbearable
[669.86s -> 673.70s]  in every fighting game I've ever played. I just can't do it. I literally can't play them.
[674.70s -> 679.18s]  I didn't even feel like I was playing online. This is not an ad. No, it's not. This is not
[679.74s -> 686.54s]  a sponsored stream. I just got access to the game. Trust me when I say there is almost no
[686.54s -> 692.92s]  input lag, at least in that match. I'm going to give it a little bit more time. What is that?
[692.92s -> 701.38s]  Does this use rollback netcode? I don't know. But holy shit, that felt phenomenal. That actually
[701.38s -> 707.64s]  felt fantastic. You know what I'm talking about when you play a game online, a fighting game,
[707.64s -> 716.10s]  especially, and you press A to do a move and it's like, hey, hey, jump, jump. It's like,
[716.10s -> 720.23s]  I'm not playing. I'm literally, I'm literally not going to play. I can't do it. I physically
[720.23s -> 727.30s]  can't play. That felt really good. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. What do I have to do? Turn
[727.30s -> 731.86s]  off? What do I have to turn off? Streamer mode? Should I try something on the character?
[731.86s -> 745.26s]  This is fun. I'm excited. Audio, streamer mode. We're, we're in line at the Superman ride.
[745.26s -> 757.64s]  Why did I turn this off? Oh dude, it's so sick. I can't believe it. We can just walk through the
[757.64s -> 765.00s]  whole queue and not experience any of the queue experience and just get like half of whatever that
[765.00s -> 770.68s]  was, that movie, that like four minute movie they're playing. I guess I'm seeing 10 seconds of it.
[770.68s -> 788.66s]  Say goodbye to the VOD, whatever. Let's try bugs. Batman's locked? I really like this. I think it's
[788.66s -> 795.03s]  because I won. Every time I play Smash Brothers Online or a fighting game online, I get fucking,
[795.03s -> 801.00s]  what's the term, beat up? It's bad. I can't even like play. I can't even have fun.
[806.15s -> 816.34s]  It's called rolled, obliterated, decimated. All right, I got a match. Uh oh. All right,
[816.34s -> 823.59s]  versus Wonder Woman. I mean, unlock your first perk bar. I get mastery level two. All right.
[823.59s -> 827.19s]  All right, let's go. Is Seinfeld going to be in the game? Are you serious?
[836.86s -> 844.18s]  All right, I don't, I don't know how to play with any of these characters. All I know is they have
[844.18s -> 847.62s]  cartoon moves. If you have a cartoon move, I'm going to be, you're going to be fine.
[850.23s -> 889.18s]  Let's two ring out. I like this. Oh, what stage is this? Oh, that's a, okay, that's a stun.
[897.05s -> 903.14s]  I don't know what his fucking moves is. I just hit myself with my own rocket.
[914.87s -> 933.85s]  He, okay, that's, what the fuck was that? Oh, oh, there comes a comeback.
[948.01s -> 965.42s]  Oh shit. What the fuck just happened? I got a pie.
[988.58s -> 1010.34s]  What the hell's that? Sorry. All right. My hands are so greasy. My hands are greasy.
[1011.38s -> 1056.18s]  You have no idea how greasy I am right now. It's bad. Oh, that's it.
[1061.86s -> 1064.34s]  I'm so greasy. You have no idea. I'm covered in fucking oil.
[1064.98s -> 1086.42s]  To do it to him. He's actually cracked. Not really. I just itched my ass on camera.
[1093.18s -> 1100.33s]  What? Why? I'm tired. I just like woke up. What the fuck am I doing? I'm fine. I'm fine.
[1100.33s -> 1111.98s]  I got a new unlock. I got a new utility perk. Copyzilla. We don't care. That's fine. I don't
[1111.98s -> 1122.49s]  care either. Fucking self report, self-made problem. Try play as Shaggy. This game's fucking
[1122.49s -> 1129.59s]  fun. I was so concerned going into this because I saw all the advertisements. I'm like, okay,
[1129.59s -> 1135.00s]  I'm not so sure. Maybe this is just first time playing. I haven't played a game like this in
[1135.00s -> 1151.10s]  a while, but this feels clean. This feels really clean and really good. I have emotes too. No,
[1151.10s -> 1156.87s]  I swear to God, this isn't even an ad. I promise you, this is not an ad. I just got access to the
[1156.87s -> 1179.16s]  game. I promise. I promise this is not sponsored. What? Oh, all right. So I can practice.
[1180.04s -> 1193.70s]  So everybody has a combo, right? He doesn't. Okay. Who am I fighting? Uh oh. I'm fighting.
[1193.70s -> 1199.45s]  It's uh oh. I'm fighting Chad Shaggy. This person's a level 10 Shaggy. I'm going to get fucking
[1199.45s -> 1248.41s]  destroyed. I'm scared. Weak Shaggy. What are all these? Uh oh. Let's go. Oh my God. I forgot
[1248.41s -> 1326.55s]  how to play. How's he doing that move? Where'd he get a sandwich? Oh, whatever. He had a perk. I
[1326.55s -> 1360.74s]  didn't have any perks. Whatever. I had perks. I don't have perks. That was fun. You know what?
[1360.74s -> 1365.48s]  I like, I think I like bugs. No, I got to play with every character at least once. How many,
[1365.48s -> 1371.59s]  how much time is left on this alpha? Oh my God. I can only play for like 40 minutes. Why didn't I
[1371.59s -> 1378.84s]  play this two days ago? Why didn't I do this like a week ago? I was so concerned. I was going to hate
[1378.84s -> 1390.10s]  it. Okay. I want to, who should I play with now? Do Tom and Jerry? All right. Hold on. Let me,
[1391.94s -> 1399.82s]  let me go into practice with Tom and Jerry. It's time to try teams. No.
[1400.46s -> 1405.94s]  How do I do just like a practice? Oh, here we go. Like advanced tutorials. No, I already know. I
[1405.94s -> 1417.48s]  kind of know that. Is there no practice? Oh no, there is practice. Yeah, there is. Okay. So let's
[1417.48s -> 1425.82s]  do Tom and Jerry. Dude, I can do pirate Tom and Jerry. Okay. So they run together. Everybody has
[1425.82s -> 1433.50s]  a double jump. Everybody has a charge. All right. That's like a three hit combo. One, two, three,
[1433.50s -> 1455.85s]  four. Pretty nice. Pretty nice. Up. Ooh. You get a pretty good combo there. Ooh. What? So all right,
[1455.85s -> 1469.61s]  regular special is you launch out Jerry. You can, excuse me? This seems advanced. This seems like
[1469.61s -> 1485.16s]  advanced techniques. That's a mouse trap. How do I get Jerry to come back? This is the hardest
[1485.24s -> 1496.34s]  character to play in the game. Okay. Well, I could probably see that. Dude, even that combo is insane.
[1496.34s -> 1510.92s]  How would you fight against this? This seems crazy. Oh, what if he dies? What's the fishing
[1510.92s -> 1524.07s]  line do? Is it a grab? Can't tell. Holy. Oh my God. If you can actually land that, that's crazy.
[1524.07s -> 1531.53s]  All right. Okay. That's cool. They're all right. They're kind of hard to play with. What about
[1531.53s -> 1547.05s]  Batman? Well, that's okay. Cool. All right. Batman. That's not ready. It's not ready.
[1547.93s -> 1555.58s]  Wait, I'm getting a, that spells not ready yet. That spells not ready yet.
[1562.70s -> 1573.70s]  This can't use that yet. All right. Batman's kind of cool. What is Batman's default spells?
[1574.74s -> 1581.32s]  All right. That's I don't, I don't know. Oh, that's the battery. Okay. Does it blows up too?
[1581.32s -> 1596.68s]  Doesn't it? Uppercut. Okay. What about down special? Ooh. Okay. Cool. What about Superman?
[1596.68s -> 1602.04s]  No, what about Velma? What does Velma do? Does that mean Scooby-Doo is going to be in the game too?
[1602.04s -> 1618.41s]  It has to be, right? Oh, I see. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I think I actually like,
[1618.41s -> 1634.82s]  I think I like Velma. That's the side. What about the charge? Okay. Up special is this weird potion.
[1636.89s -> 1657.85s]  Oh, it's a freeze. Why do I have a big head mode? What happened? All right. So side B is this like
[1657.85s -> 1664.39s]  run and you grab and then you, can you throw them off? You take them to the edge and then they bounce
[1664.39s -> 1674.15s]  backwards. Okay. All right. I like Velma. I'm going to try Velma. I think the next game. What is this?
[1674.15s -> 1694.26s]  Who's this Pokemon? Rain dog? Who's rain dog? What show is this from? All right. What's standard?
[1695.74s -> 1707.75s]  Actually kind of good. This is an OC character. Oh, really? All right. Seems kind of cool.
[1708.47s -> 1735.86s]  Be Jake. He's pretty, pretty, pretty good. All right. How about Jake? I like that three hit combo.
[1736.50s -> 1751.03s]  Two, three. What about, what about down attack? Nice. That's really good. Oh, he's super stretchy
[1751.03s -> 1761.42s]  too. All right. So what about standard special? It's a bite. Oh, okay. That's a cool down.
[1762.30s -> 1765.75s]  All right. That was pretty cool. Or what about down special? You turn into a house.
[1766.84s -> 1774.92s]  I'm imagining, right. Okay. It's like Pac-Man. All right. What about side? Turn into a horse.
[1777.70s -> 1784.15s]  That's up special. That's pretty cool. All right. So could I, so let's, let's do a little bit of a
[1784.15s -> 1809.59s]  combo here. So check this out. Ready? Oops. No. Oh, all right. Cool. Nice combo. Whatever. Oh,
[1809.59s -> 1826.54s]  what about Steven Universe? Standard punch. Okay. That's a three hit combo. Why is it a bubble?
[1826.54s -> 1837.61s]  That's pretty cool. Side smash, up smash, uppercut. All right. What about specials?
[1842.62s -> 1856.74s]  What the hell is that? So that's a projectile defense. Okay. What about up? What the fuck?
[1857.38s -> 1877.11s]  What can I jump? Can I jump on them? Oh my God. I can jump on them. Holy shit. You can knock them
[1877.11s -> 1884.15s]  into the, um, all right. That's advanced techniques. Pretty cool though. All right. What about garnet?
[1884.79s -> 1898.41s]  All right. I like that multiple hit combo. What about down? That's very far reaching.
[1902.52s -> 1923.45s]  Seems incredibly powerful. All right. Wow. What a fun game. Jesus, man. What am I doing?
[1924.41s -> 1931.46s]  I'm so unaware of the weird gross things I'm doing today. All right. What about, uh, up?
[1932.26s -> 1970.82s]  Do you put these stars out? All right. Pretty sick. What about Superman? Oh, Ari Stark. All
[1970.82s -> 1978.55s]  right. Very quick. I feel like this is going to be a, a meta character. Lots of fast movement
[1978.55s -> 1998.36s]  slashes, tons of fucking movement speed. All right. Sick. Let's go. I'm ready. I'm going to
[1998.36s -> 2013.26s]  play around as Belma. Oh, I still want to do 1v1. Oh my God. I forgot what Jake and Finn are,
[2013.26s -> 2022.10s]  Finn's in this. I didn't even see them. All right. What do you got for stuff?
[2032.12s -> 2038.97s]  What about your perks? I don't, I don't have any perks. All right. Belma versus Steven universe.
[2041.37s -> 2049.35s]  See, I don't have any perks. Equip all. Let's go. I don't have any perks. See? All right. We're both
[2049.35s -> 2067.54s]  level one. It's fine. Not one of these matches has felt laggy. Not one. And that gosh darn it.
[2067.54s -> 2075.70s]  I mean it. I feel like I'm connected with a ethernet cable to this other person's computer.
[2079.86s -> 2124.25s]  What's that? You went through the stage. Get away from me. Oh my God. Don't fall off the
[2124.25s -> 2259.38s]  waves. All right. Sorry. I got 60%. I got 60%. What was that sound? I feel like I'm not playing
[2259.38s -> 2281.93s]  her correctly. You look like the annoying orange. What are you talking about? Am I level two yet?
[2282.65s -> 2309.77s]  Oh, I got some boxes. Oh, I got a perk. Cool. Collection. Oh, okay. Gold times a hundred. Okay.
[2309.77s -> 2318.57s]  So I have this. Your team receives 10% reduced ability cooldown. How do I put that on? This taunts
[2318.57s -> 2331.42s]  too. All right. I'm going to play bugs and I'm going to do team fight. Let's try it. Team fight.
[2331.42s -> 2350.63s]  Choose your character. This is a rare. Whoa. All right. Cool. I don't, I can't do anything,
[2350.63s -> 2365.32s]  sort of. Definitely going to put this on. All right. So it's 2v2. I love this. These kids
[2365.32s -> 2390.10s]  game Tuber reactions. I'm actually excited. These kids game. Double fucking Batman. What the hell is
[2390.10s -> 2412.57s]  this? Is this allowed? At least we have perks. Prepare yourself. All right. I actually would
[2412.57s -> 2426.68s]  probably bet on this team. If this were real. I think you're the toughest I've gone up against.
[2426.68s -> 2496.18s]  Let's go. Watch out. Oh, got him. Slowed him. He slowed. He slowed. Got him. Good interrupt.
[2496.66s -> 2548.09s]  Shit. Oh, got him. Sorry. Sorry. Don't let him get away. Don't let him get away.
[2561.37s -> 2579.58s]  Nice job. I got carried. No, I didn't. I got carried. That was a good team effort.
[2587.86s -> 2608.92s]  That was a team effort, man. Equal effort. Yeah. Although I am in the, okay, so all the level ones,
[2608.92s -> 2614.26s]  this is why I love playing a new fighting game right when it comes out. Because all of us,
[2614.26s -> 2619.45s]  every single person besides a small percentage of people, we're all just kind of pressing buttons.
[2619.45s -> 2631.54s]  It's great. I love it. We're all just kind of still, I don't even, I don't even know what
[2631.54s -> 2635.94s]  Bugs's downbeat even really does. I know it goes underground,
[2635.94s -> 2644.14s]  but I mean, everybody else thinks that too. It's great. Prepare for my dectifying exploits.
[2647.93s -> 2657.64s]  Say hi to my uncle. Hey, you know what? I don't even care. Just fuck the whole thing up.
[2658.36s -> 2677.06s]  What is going on? I do look like a big kid. What's happening right now? I look like a big kid.
[2677.06s -> 2698.12s]  What's going on? That's better. Put it to a middle part. I don't think I can even do
[2698.12s -> 2711.50s]  a middle part. I don't, I actually don't think I can do a middle part. That was just wet.
[2711.50s -> 2718.46s]  Please put glasses on. All right. I got to pay attention to this. I'm like, I'm like seven in
[2718.46s -> 2815.70s]  one right now. Shit. What's wrong with me? Oh, how did he fucking miss that? I'm gonna
[2815.70s -> 2821.40s]  fall off of this motherfucker's 143 Fahrenheit. That guy's at 143 degrees Fahrenheit. Fucking
[2821.40s -> 2896.55s]  get rid of him. Finally. Shit. Look at this. 420 damage. I'm starting to understand, but I
[2896.55s -> 2904.89s]  didn't throw it. What are you talking about? I didn't jump out of bounds. I'm starting to
[2904.89s -> 2913.18s]  understand Bugs Bunny's moves. You got to pick somebody and just play. That's the only way.
[2913.98s -> 2921.83s]  You got to just play. I'm going Bugs. What about the chapstick? Thank God for reminding me.
[2922.39s -> 2935.77s]  Of course. Just play the game. Oh, they're both level one. I think we're fine. Is this the same
[2935.77s -> 2962.31s]  person that I was with last time? More games for your wax face. What did I just witness? I don't
[2962.31s -> 3065.29s]  know. Whatever. Let's do it. Oh, no. Oh, Jake, no. Stupid reactions. Oh, missed it out. Oh,
[3065.29s -> 3123.62s]  my pie. Fuck you. I got to get a stun. Goodbye. What happened? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[3124.02s -> 3127.22s]  we got it right there. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Don't worry.
[3128.26s -> 3143.45s]  I got it. I got it. We win. I feel like I went pretty cracked out right there.
[3151.80s -> 3166.94s]  Nice job. That was a nice game. That was a nice fight. Good job. Your lips are way too pink. I
[3166.94s -> 3181.02s]  don't know what you want me to say, man. Your lips are too pink. Oh, all right. Cool. I'm enjoying
[3181.02s -> 3188.25s]  my multiverse game. What time is it? I have one hour to enjoy this. All right. One more match of
[3188.25s -> 3202.33s]  bugs. I mean, I'm going to go back to wait, money. Cool. I accept a rematch and teams are one v one.
[3206.60s -> 3212.65s]  What's the next game after this? I have I don't know. I downloaded like four things. I have
[3212.65s -> 3224.52s]  Sniper Elite five, the Miku game project, um, mega mix or something. And then I also have
[3225.69s -> 3231.83s]  Pac-Man museum, which I feel like I hold on a minute. Let me see. I know the kick kick into the
[3231.83s -> 3244.23s]  bat. I like bugs is hold on a minute. His side air is really, really good. It's really powerful.
[3244.23s -> 3257.03s]  Use your character. I gotta stop spamming the mallet though. That sounds good to me.
[3257.67s -> 3264.33s]  What is this? Your team deals one additional damage when knocked back.
[3264.33s -> 3278.60s]  Enemies collide. Okay, cool. Oh, we got a mirror. Oh, what is that? That's fucking crazy.
[3280.52s -> 3297.96s]  That's crazy. That's, that's really powerful. I got it. What stage is this?
[3297.96s -> 3380.94s]  Oh, I almost got it. Left trigger. How do I use this? Get out of here. Easy on the edge here.
[3444.12s -> 3458.98s]  Shit, that was close. I could, I got caught up. I got caught up. Yeah, let's go. Let's go again.
[3458.98s -> 3473.51s]  I feel like that was good teams. I threw. Let's go. No, I didn't. Let's do rematch.
[3473.51s -> 3488.94s]  Choose your character. All right. I'm going to change it up a little bit here. Lord stock.
[3489.50s -> 3519.48s]  You must be thirsty. Snacks. Yeah, let's go. Snacks. Did you turn the swear filter off?
[3519.48s -> 3538.01s]  I don't know. Maybe. Can I get a birthday wish? Happy birthday. It's your birthday today.
[3538.57s -> 3551.61s]  Happy birthday. It's a kid's game. You need to stop sweating. I sweat all day, man. I could be
[3551.61s -> 3559.21s]  reading a book in bed and I'll just be like sweaty. Even if the book is, it could be a cookbook. It
[3559.21s -> 3573.29s]  doesn't matter what it is. Honestly, it does not matter. All right. Right off the bat. Go in.
[3573.29s -> 3645.98s]  And I forgot how to press the button. This guy fucking fly up already. Holy shit. Do we have any
[3645.98s -> 3659.29s]  fucking power? Dude, fucking can we knock somebody off the fucking edge? I just spit a tooth out.
[3660.09s -> 3661.05s]  That's what it felt like.
[3661.77s -> 3666.36s]  At least he didn't eat me.
[3747.98s -> 3756.02s]  What's happening? I don't know what happened. I'm so fucking sweaty. Oh, what happened?
[3756.90s -> 3762.18s]  I didn't know you could hold on to the edge like that. I was like stuck to the edge. What was that?
[3764.09s -> 3774.30s]  Fuck. I was stuck to the edge. You're peeking your mic. I'm going to fucking break it in half.
[3779.24s -> 3791.45s]  Nice mic. All right. Taz is fun, but like I just, the up, his recovery move is not that great.
[3792.17s -> 3798.34s]  You can hold on to walls and climb back. Yeah, that freaked me out. I was just stuck on the wall.
[3798.34s -> 3806.97s]  I was just started mashing buttons. I was freaking out. All right. We're going back.
[3806.97s -> 3828.46s]  Oh, I was already in a party. Sorry. Can I buy some stuff versus the AI? Free for all?
[3828.46s -> 3841.91s]  Foreplay of mayhem. Let's do some 1v1s. Let's go back to bugs.
[3848.39s -> 3865.77s]  I have a black eye? No, it's the shadow from like, uh oh, Tom and Jerry. That's good. All right. Let
[3865.85s -> 3878.84s]  me, like the 1v1 scenario, I think I'd be fine. Prepare yourself. Oh, the reacting YouTuber to
[3878.84s -> 3888.74s]  the fun new kids game. That's not, it's not even a kid's game. Batman's in this. That's T for teen.
[3888.74s -> 3985.67s]  I'll beat you. All right. Leave me alone. I got to win a match. Oh, the bounce. Damn it.
[3985.99s -> 3993.43s]  Use this.
[3996.66s -> 4047.38s]  Huh? Damn it. I want to end up with that. This is really funny. What? Piece of cake. I'm not a
[4047.38s -> 4056.26s]  victory in the continue. You know what? I got to get used to. So with the analog, when you press
[4056.26s -> 4062.58s]  up to do up smash or up air, whatever, sometimes I do left or right because the analog is still
[4062.58s -> 4074.76s]  thinking I'm pressing left and right when I'm trying to press up skill issue, skill issue.
[4075.40s -> 4094.09s]  It looks like a black eye. I think I'm just very red today. I shaved and I'm playing an intense
[4095.54s -> 4103.48s]  fighting game and I'm trying to do and I'm trying to get as much. Look,
[4103.48s -> 4107.00s]  I'm trying to just go, go, go, go, go, because I only have like 40 minutes left in the fucking
[4107.00s -> 4127.51s]  alpha. It's a smudge on the camera. I don't think so. It looks like you're wearing rogue,
[4128.62s -> 4153.34s]  rouge, rogue blush. I'm just super excitable right now. I'm just super excitable. I'm playing a game
[4153.34s -> 4158.92s]  that I'm intensely paying attention. You know, I get shit on this channel all the time for dude,
[4158.92s -> 4163.48s]  fucking read the tutorial. Why are you walking into walls? Dude, you went in a circle five times.
[4164.28s -> 4166.76s]  I'm getting victories here and I'm getting red.
[4166.76s -> 4331.19s]  Red. Oh, you caught me. Nice job. Nice job. Shit. What was that? How are you still alive?
[4331.99s -> 4358.76s]  That was crazy. Good fight. How are you still alive? You had 200%. Yeah, I know I did. You're
[4358.76s -> 4375.32s]  right. Look at this beautiful blushy boy. I need a haircut. I'm just sweating. It's not even blush
[4375.32s -> 4392.12s]  people. Oh my God. He's blushing. No, I'm sweaty and in pain. That's it. Oh, he's blushy. Bugs again.
[4392.12s -> 4407.51s]  Let's go. This is actually really fun. Let me see something. So the air specials are different.
[4407.51s -> 4422.33s]  Choose your character. Okay. I got to drop that safe more often.
[4422.89s -> 4439.11s]  It reminds me of the Pac-Man fire hydrant from Smash. Prepare yourself. Oh my God. I haven't
[4439.11s -> 4447.85s]  blinked in an hour and 15 minutes. Clean the camera. There's nothing wrong with the camera.
[4448.65s -> 4488.55s]  Get your eyes checked.
[4587.13s -> 4596.98s]  All right. You morphed on him? Let's go again. That was a good one. That was intense.
[4603.93s -> 4610.81s]  You didn't speak at all? Yeah. I'm trying to win. I'm trying to play. Guys, I have to prove at
[4610.81s -> 4617.22s]  least once a year that I understand the concept of a video game. At least once every six months.
[4618.82s -> 4624.14s]  I have to at least prove to you guys that I can still drive the video game car sometimes.
[4635.59s -> 4640.95s]  This is fun as fuck too. God, I'm so happy. A fighting game. Finally, for the love of God,
[4641.59s -> 4647.72s]  I can actually play the game online. It's not I press a button and a half a second later,
[4647.80s -> 4662.12s]  the action happens. So explain to me while I play because I won't read it, but I'll
[4662.12s -> 4668.04s]  somebody will spam it to me later. Why is this so clean? Why is this so good?
[4718.68s -> 4792.76s]  Oh, nice hit. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job.
[4827.35s -> 4894.41s]  I got to get in there. I got to get in. He's getting too much range. Oh, I missed it.
[4920.09s -> 4960.15s]  Anyone taunt? Good job. That was insane. All right. One more. One more. This is a rematch.
[4960.15s -> 4967.21s]  Yeah, we got the best two out of three. Let's go. You look like a skin walker.
[4968.57s -> 4972.89s]  I'm sorry. What do you want me to do? How's this? Is this better?
[4979.08s -> 4985.40s]  All right. This is this is for all the marbles. This is for all the marbles.
[4987.66s -> 4996.09s]  That was intense. God, it's I feel like that super villain that is so happy that finally there's a
[4996.09s -> 5000.65s]  challenge for him. You know what I mean? Like finally, finally I can play against somebody
[5000.65s -> 5019.70s]  that's intense and that feeling of fighting and strength. Finally. You look like Mega Mind.
[5019.70s -> 5024.84s]  All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. This is this is it. Now I know why people play these.
[5025.66s -> 5030.38s]  I get it because my whole body is like kind of nervous. Is that weird? All right, let's go.
[5093.50s -> 5139.08s]  Oh, my God. Do it. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What's happening? All right. All right. Let's go.
[5139.08s -> 5176.98s]  Match point. Red team. You lost your friend.
[5194.17s -> 5208.33s]  Good fight. Good match. God damn. Damn. That was fun. Nice fight. I was really afraid that
[5208.33s -> 5225.48s]  you're going to come back there. Oh, my goodness. I look 14. I have to stop shaving my face. I feel
[5225.48s -> 5229.08s]  like people look at me when I shave my face. They go, what's wrong? Why does he look so weird?
[5240.55s -> 5252.94s]  I understand what people are saying now. Holy shit. Oh, my God, dude. That looks crazy.
[5253.74s -> 5258.26s]  All right, we got only got like 21 minutes till the alpha is over.
[5267.10s -> 5270.62s]  All right, we're going experimental here because I know I can play with bugs. Bugs is my main,
[5271.34s -> 5274.97s]  but I kind of want to just jump around as another character in the 20 minutes I have left.
[5277.75s -> 5295.74s]  What does Wonder Woman do? Let me go back. Okay. The thing about... Okay, but what about bugs is...
[5296.54s -> 5305.59s]  Oh, that's what that does. Okay. There's so many more combos I could have been doing.
[5308.15s -> 5319.72s]  If you're in the air, he paints it. I get it. Okay. Interesting. All right, let me see Wonder
[5319.72s -> 5330.41s]  Woman. What's the combo for Wonder Woman? Cool. One, two, three. The one thing I don't like about
[5330.41s -> 5336.01s]  bugs is bugs has kind of a weird combo. He just goes like this and you can miss it really easily.
[5336.73s -> 5361.53s]  Okay. What is that? Oh, okay. Is that a pull? Oh, it's on a cooldown. That's like a little dash.
[5362.73s -> 5372.41s]  All right. Down special seems to be a shield, I think. Up special is this float and you can...
[5372.41s -> 5375.82s]  Okay. All right. I think it seems pretty self-explanatory.
[5377.37s -> 5388.18s]  It's a sword character. I'm wondering about that whip. All right. Let's go for it.
[5388.18s -> 5398.23s]  It seems cool. Sword Andy. I only got like 15 minutes to play this game.
[5401.02s -> 5402.94s]  We'll go back to teams. That's just fun to jump around.
[5410.17s -> 5414.17s]  And I am genuinely not fucking around. I know that we fuck around a lot on this channel and
[5414.17s -> 5430.20s]  I mean, and we tell a lot of jokes. This is very good. I mean, go ahead and say
[5430.20s -> 5435.56s]  add if you want. It really is. This is like the most fun I've played in a fighting game
[5435.56s -> 5449.56s]  since I was like fucking like 16 or something because it works. It looks really fun. I'm telling
[5449.56s -> 5457.00s]  you it is. All right. So while there's a few minutes here, why can this game play so well on
[5457.00s -> 5463.24s]  the internet? What is this thing people were saying? This like netcode thing. And why doesn't
[5463.24s -> 5475.70s]  every video game that's a fighting game use it? It's called rollback netcode. Prepare yourself.
[5475.70s -> 5480.26s]  For no reason. Is there a downside or something? Why wouldn't anybody use it?
[5480.26s -> 5490.30s]  It's really difficult to implement. It's pretty much arcane magic. It predicts what you were just
[5490.30s -> 5503.58s]  going to do. The infants of our tribe are stronger than you. Let's go. Shit.
[5532.76s -> 5547.98s]  Don't fall off the edge like an idiot. Oh wait, I just jumped. I'm giving my teammate that. What?
[5548.38s -> 5586.79s]  In the future. There it is. One more, right? Blue team.
[5591.37s -> 5614.44s]  Oh, you fly to your teammate. All right. Red team.
[5624.95s -> 5634.25s]  Oh, get that last hit. Oh my God. Kill. Kill before I die. I blew it. I blew it for us.
[5634.25s -> 5637.61s]  I blew it for us. Way too bad. I just didn't. I didn't know how high her thing went. It's the
[5637.61s -> 5643.77s]  first time I played with her. I blew it. I just like didn't know how high the thing.
[5643.77s -> 5649.54s]  It's the first time I played with that character. Sorry. I'm sorry. It was fun. All right. New
[5649.54s -> 5659.02s]  character. I threw and now I did. So it's really hard to implement this netcode. Who made this
[5659.02s -> 5681.80s]  game? What? What developer made this game? Because and what else did they do? Me. Let me spend some
[5681.80s -> 5687.94s]  currency first. It's really hard to implement. Well, they did a phenomenal fucking job.
[5693.93s -> 5697.13s]  Batman is locked. I want to play a game with Superman. How much does he cost?
[5697.69s -> 5708.02s]  How do I unlock him? 2000 gold. All right. Yeah, sure. I want to try and match with Superman.
[5708.82s -> 5726.26s]  Stop swearing. My mom's getting mad at me. That's a mature audit. You had to click the
[5726.26s -> 5744.63s]  mature audience thing. All right. Let's play before the servers turn off. Let me just see how he is.
[5744.63s -> 5754.12s]  Wonder Woman seems pretty solid. Just a solid pick. All right. Let's see Superman. Superman has
[5754.12s -> 5765.24s]  this punch. Big charge. That combo seems insane. And you finish it off with one of these.
[5766.98s -> 5782.57s]  One, two, one, two. Jesus. All right. Superman is very much a punch character.
[5783.74s -> 5790.57s]  I actually really like characters like this. I like just bouncing. Okay. So what about your
[5790.57s -> 5802.65s]  specials? This is ice breath, right? Okay. What about side special? Holy shit. I can aim that too.
[5804.01s -> 5809.29s]  Okay. Superman seems pretty ridiculous. Is Superman insane? What's the tier list look like?
[5809.93s -> 5821.82s]  All right. Down special. What's the application here? Oh, you just, okay. It's kind of like a
[5821.90s -> 5837.26s]  defense. Up special is big fly. Can you fly as Superman? No. You can fly as Superman.
[5840.33s -> 5859.85s]  So you have to be in the air. Wow. Holy shit. All right. Superman seems pretty fucking cracked,
[5859.85s -> 5875.69s]  if I'm honest. Let's go. Is he not? They nerfed him? Do they even have time to nerf any of these
[5875.69s -> 5891.93s]  characters? The game has been in early closed alpha for like five days. Choose your character.
[5891.93s -> 5909.27s]  There was already a closed network test. Oh, okay. I'll do my best. I'll try it. How can
[5909.27s -> 5917.93s]  be staring into our souls? I'm reading the chat room. He looks off. Maybe you think it's because
[5917.93s -> 5923.13s]  of this? Do you think it has anything to do with whatever this is right now? Do you think it has
[5923.13s -> 5927.88s]  anything to do with how off I look today? I wonder if you think it has anything to do with this.
[5932.36s -> 5942.44s]  They mean Superman, right? That's what I was saying too. That's what I was saying too.
[5942.44s -> 6000.17s]  All right. Superman time. I feel like with a little practice, I would really like Superman.
[6041.46s -> 6116.87s]  He kind of lumbers around, but he's really powerful. Oh shit. I keep getting caught.
[6121.00s -> 6152.81s]  That's probably it. Whoa. What the fuck was that? Get him. Jesus. He's a little slow,
[6154.49s -> 6166.09s]  but I like the power. I like the move set. It's pretty good. This is a man-sized character. I
[6166.09s -> 6170.65s]  only got 10 minutes. Okay. Well, should I play it? All right. Viewer's choice. Who do you want me
[6170.65s -> 6180.38s]  to play with? Superman has a triple jump? Viewer's choice. What do you think? Shaggy?
[6180.38s -> 6198.66s]  I haven't played with Shaggy. You're right. Okay. Shaggy. I played a lot with bugs already.
[6201.99s -> 6205.75s]  I did one. I played the first two matches with Shaggy, but I had kind of no idea what the hell
[6205.75s -> 6214.87s]  was going on. All right. He's got a combo. What are his moves are doing here? He has this super
[6214.87s -> 6246.04s]  Saiyan mode. Interesting. Okay. He goes ultra instinct. I have to move this light. Oh, that's
[6246.04s -> 6249.64s]  our Harley Quinn's in the game. Does that mean the Joker will be in the game eventually? I feel like
[6249.64s -> 6255.05s]  all the Batman characters will be eventually. They have quite a roster they can fill out if
[6255.05s -> 6297.42s]  they really want to. I would love to see Daffy Duck. I don't know where he is. Oh, I got it.
[6297.42s -> 6353.94s]  Can I eat this? What can I do with this? What do I do with this sandwich? Oh, I got it. Oh shit.
[6354.02s -> 6361.66s]  Oh my God. I keep trying to just flatten them. What? He went through the fucking thing.
[6374.84s -> 6404.07s]  Oh my fucking God. Knock him off. I don't like Shaggy. What the fuck? Why can he go through that?
[6404.07s -> 6410.54s]  That's so weird. This motherfucker can go through the whole stage.
[6411.26s -> 6429.14s]  Holy shit. Shaggy. You're the fucking worst character in the game.
[6429.14s -> 6476.86s]  Okay. He's fucking terrible. Shaggy fucking. Oh, Shaggy. Look at Shaggy.
[6479.08s -> 6495.34s]  Holy. Shaggy is the worst character in the game. Actual skill issue. Shaggy's S tier. Not for me.
[6495.34s -> 6506.84s]  Not for me. Quick. I got to do one more with bugs. Before Craftman blames his tools,
[6506.84s -> 6510.92s]  Shaggy just like smokes weed and fucking sits in a chair and screams at ghosts.
[6511.08s -> 6522.38s]  He doesn't have any superpowers. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower.
[6522.38s -> 6525.68s]  Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower.
[6525.68s -> 6530.46s]  Superpower, guy that eats food. He's terrible. Never playing with him ever again.
[6542.89s -> 6552.58s]  What about Velma? Velma has like 180 IQ. Super powered intellect. Oh, I like that.
[6559.24s -> 6583.91s]  Batman. Batman is the superpower of money. What about Harley Quinn? Harley Quinn is the superpower
[6583.91s -> 6689.34s]  of new york accent what the fuck is that thing all right that's a good one to go out on it's
