[0.00s -> 1.52s]  Wait, talk. I don't think people can hear you.
[3.02s -> 5.38s]  Oh shit, talk. I don't think people can hear you.
[7.86s -> 16.02s]  And I have one of those too. Oh shit. I don't think people can hear you. Oh shit. I don't think I can do that too. Oh shit. I don't think people hear you.
[18.28s -> 19.04s]  It didn't do anything.
[19.50s -> 26.92s]  No, I didn't miss it. I didn't. I'm here. We're here. I know you're here. I'm just, you know, I just, this was my big break.

[29.24s -> 32.40s]  All right, look hold on I got I got how do I turn this down?
[32.40s -> 37.40s]  Both of them so much individually and I'm really curious to see what that I'm here
[38.36s -> 41.28s]  They and how different it might be from pretty much in the wrong place
[45.28s -> 49.64s]  60 seconds see you don't ever go to the movie with the previews are on
[50.20s -> 55.00s]  Well, I really need to see the Gemini man trailer like ten more times. I've already seen it
[55.68s -> 62.10s]  This is the same amount of time when we travel together like how much time was left in boarding
[63.16s -> 65.16s]  Yeah, you get right on the plane
[66.12s -> 68.81s]  You get right on the plane
[70.81s -> 75.69s]  Get to the terminal fucking like two hours early. No you get right on the plane
[76.81s -> 78.81s]  Yeah, but what about?
[80.01s -> 81.13s]  Hillary's email
[81.13s -> 87.15s]  What about the people that don't know that you were gonna stream and come in late and then okay on my stream
[88.49s -> 94.33s]  We've got a no chatter left behind policy and if you don't start early you're leaving people behind who didn't know
[94.33s -> 110.33s]  No, they were here. No early
[111.73s -> 116.53s]  What do you know? How do I do it? What's fun? I'm gonna talk during the cut
[116.53s -> 119.77s]  I have to meet I have to be able to deafen you during the big reveal of Elden Ring
[119.77s -> 124.09s]  Okay. Well, you've got you've got 60 seconds to figure out how to do it. All right, let me figure it out
[124.09s -> 126.09s]  I have to tweet that I'm here. I
[127.05s -> 131.41s]  Got a tweet. I can tweet my mother that like we're about to get on the plane. Okay. Yeah, I
[132.25s -> 134.62s]  Got a I got a story for you, by the way
[135.66s -> 140.58s]  Just I don't know why I was late. I have a lot that I wanted to talk to you about but I don't really have the time
[140.58s -> 144.50s]  We got the after show. That's what that's for. We sit and we talk about our what our thoughts were
[150.78s -> 152.78s]  Yeah
[152.78s -> 156.58s]  Well, not dead silent you can like coffins they make like old man noises
[160.10s -> 162.10s]  Seats on the plane
[166.60s -> 170.44s]  Anyways, hi guys. Welcome to e3 shows gonna begin at 55 seconds
[175.70s -> 178.08s]  Yeah, I got to turn you up this down
[178.74s -> 190.38s]  Yeah, what do you guys want to hear more?
[190.66s -> 199.36s]  What if I did it? Okay. All right. I got it. What do you guys want to hear more me and stars hood?
[199.36s -> 203.86s]  Larry is banter. We're like I want to hear they want to hear
[204.34s -> 208.70s]  What is the future of gaming with more ways to play than ever before?
[209.06s -> 214.94s]  We're finally bringing to the home console. Yeah, my dream is generation. Why is my true? Oh fuck. Hold on
[214.94s -> 218.26s]  I'm gonna disconnect for like five seconds. I'm lagging. There we go
[219.02s -> 225.26s]  Sorry, I was running. I'm good. I'm good. We're good. Good. Welcome to the e3 conference. I'm here. I'm here. I'm good
[225.26s -> 228.01s]  I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Okay
[228.17s -> 234.09s]  Now if you could follow your own advice and please the movie is starting I want some complete silence. All right
[234.09s -> 239.69s]  All right. All right. I'm good. I'm good. We're old depth of the trailers. They've worked a long time on creating
[240.43s -> 248.19s]  Yeah, I can turn this up. What did you want to talk about? I don't have time
[248.19s -> 251.55s]  There's there is not enough time to get into it. It's like a whole
[253.07s -> 257.77s]  Shit on the screen get this off the screen. How do I turn this off? How do I get this off?
[259.51s -> 264.99s]  20 years you click on on the right side. There's a there's a twitch gaming pop-out and like you click on that
[266.39s -> 268.39s]  That's a not visible
[269.91s -> 271.91s]  All right
[272.67s -> 280.29s]  Watch this guy talking everyone around will come together and celebrate what games mean to all of us
[280.29s -> 284.09s]  But you don't know how to mute me so I'm self-conscious now fuck they've meant even more all right
[284.09s -> 289.17s]  Stop Todd's talking for being with us today. Thank you for the support. You give us and one another
[289.41s -> 294.92s]  He thinks we're friends 20 and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the friendships
[294.92s -> 301.60s]  We've had that whole time at Bethesda. We believe video games do one thing better than anything else
[301.96s -> 304.60s]  They transport us through art and technology
[305.52s -> 309.68s]  There's real magic when you step into a new world and can make it your own
[310.60s -> 318.00s]  We've traveled the worlds of Elder Scrolls of fallout and now for the first time in over 25 years
[318.60s -> 320.60s]  We're creating a new universe
[320.64s -> 326.68s]  With starfield oh we already knew that hundreds of years in our future. It's a new that did you know that about hope?
[327.20s -> 331.16s]  Your humanity and yeah, I'm greatest mystery
[331.36s -> 334.78s]  It's a game we've dreamt of playing and it wasn't till now
[335.78s -> 341.06s]  Where the technology and the team who's hard it was your first time don't worry about it make that dream a reality
[342.10s -> 348.06s]  We're excited to finally share our first in-game teaser and something was in game all right
[348.06s -> 353.54s]  I'm on my phone. Are you what I was just like
[354.58s -> 361.08s]  Attention all right quiet. I did that during Elden ring. I didn't even realize it was on screen
[361.08s -> 380.19s]  I just talked over it stop dude am I the guy that has to tell his own friend to shut the fuck up at the movie
[380.51s -> 384.03s]  No one's there where I'm talking about. He's walking. He's climbing a ladder
[384.03s -> 387.23s]  Can you visually see this or do you need your ears to hear the ladder clank?
[387.23s -> 394.23s]  You may as well just be smoking a cigarette next to me like get the put that shit out. They say okay the wonder is
[394.75s -> 397.59s]  Not that the field of stars is so vast
[398.47s -> 400.47s]  But that we have measured it
[400.59s -> 405.44s]  You're part of constellation now part of our family
[406.76s -> 408.52s]  What you found?
[408.52s -> 410.76s]  It's the key to unlocking
[411.76s -> 420.30s]  Everything this is all we've been working towards
[422.06s -> 427.98s]  I have so many drinks. I don't know which one my drink. We've come to the beginning of humanity. Excuse me
[443.80s -> 448.20s]  To discover what's out there
[448.20s -> 450.20s]  Yeah
[451.00s -> 462.10s]  Yeah, no gameplay no by can I tell you I'm sick. I'm sick of the space shit
[463.30s -> 465.30s]  Space shit, and we saw this movie already
[466.14s -> 470.91s]  Space shit is the new zombie shit. It's the new I don't I don't care for space stuff anymore
[471.59s -> 480.58s]  Okay, so um I mean there's this gigantic vast universe, and you just don't want anything to take place in it
[480.58s -> 485.84s]  But I it's just like I'm sad honest. I'm sick of seeing the guy the astronaut helmet on I've seen it a thousand times
[488.03s -> 490.73s]  Water I don't I'm sick of seeing
[499.87s -> 504.23s]  I did imagine a movie that like every every like five to ten minutes. It's stopped
[511.23s -> 513.23s]  You get to discuss what you just watch
[514.07s -> 516.07s]  Well, yeah, I mean how many buzzwords
[517.43s -> 519.43s]  Somebody
[522.75s -> 528.16s]  We are committed to forging the next getting Komodo hype right now, what is that?
[531.68s -> 533.68s]  It's only 50% that's not
[534.88s -> 540.68s]  50% you guys you gotta spam it gamers rise up not here. Do you spend it in this?
[541.92s -> 543.92s]  Is the main chat
[544.40s -> 550.40s]  If you do it in there it counts it's all twitch does not count so today of course they count
[551.20s -> 555.84s]  This looks bad. We can't even get it to 50% show 30 tight. Yeah, you got to amp it up
[557.08s -> 564.76s]  If it gets to the top every single they cancel Starfield today is optimized for Xbox series X and S
[565.52s -> 569.02s]  This is weird to have this on the screen and features
[571.16s -> 573.52s]  This is I don't know why this should not be on
[574.20s -> 580.98s]  This is the equivalent of us saying do we just talk over her like they're trying to put something on the screen to entertain you
[580.98s -> 584.16s]  Well, she just like does like the Naruto filler
[584.80s -> 589.72s]  Like oh, this is the last like five years of games. We've released. We're gonna tell you that we did this and
[590.32s -> 595.42s]  You you guys just like play with this toy. We give you for a second, but it's filled. So what happens?
[597.76s -> 601.28s]  What if she looked over to the left of the screen and was like, oh the height meter filled
[601.32s -> 605.56s]  That's what I put on the funny hat and like it's like a hat comes down she puts it on
[605.88s -> 611.64s]  Well logically that can't happen because this is streaming on multiple platforms and only twitch has the meter. Oh shit
[611.64s -> 613.64s]  This is actually a gameplay. Oh
[613.68s -> 615.68s]  you know what I mean, I
[616.16s -> 618.16s]  Thought this was light
[618.60s -> 620.60s]  It looks so real
[622.48s -> 624.78s]  Your place talker got to
[627.02s -> 630.94s]  We can do it movie theater style, hey, dude, did you play stalker?
[631.90s -> 636.38s]  I tried to like a long time ago and I I didn't have a good computer and it just crashed so I gave up
[636.38s -> 638.38s]  Yeah, yeah, who is that? Who is that?
[640.30s -> 645.74s]  John stalker I what I was in the bathroom. What's that guy do?
[648.16s -> 655.92s]  Character from Metro. Okay. Hey, it's your fucking seat. I got sticky
[664.48s -> 666.64s]  Sorry, sorry the movie's too loud
[681.02s -> 694.10s]  This really looks like Metro this game's kind of fun it really was I've heard a lot of good things
[697.61s -> 701.46s]  I think you would actually like this game. I think I would too
[701.90s -> 703.90s]  I mean like the whole series
[722.74s -> 724.74s]  That is you talking I don't know why for some reason
[762.38s -> 767.66s]  I was looking down at my water and I looked up and I thought that the model he was dancing with did not load in
[767.66s -> 769.66s]  And they were freaking out behind the scenes
[801.14s -> 803.14s]  Donald Waller
[818.26s -> 820.94s]  Mutual sir actually looks kind of look a bit pretty good. Yeah
[821.90s -> 823.58s]  That's a hush. Oh
[823.58s -> 828.44s]  One of them is a sushi. Um, I just want to let you know
[828.44s -> 835.60s]  Can everyone listening know that I've decided so that we can have a totally neutral and our biased review of e3
[838.04s -> 840.60s]  You're gonna disagree with me on everything. Yeah
[842.08s -> 843.92s]  This game looks like garbage
[844.12s -> 848.46s]  It was a typically a slower pace to tactical game and they've got people running around
[857.25s -> 862.16s]  It's like you German what
[875.69s -> 878.82s]  Understand you you get into these like
[880.66s -> 882.66s]  People get it
[882.66s -> 884.66s]  Oh wait, you know
[888.66s -> 893.77s]  Roll the tape back
[893.77s -> 895.57s]  streamer reveal I
[895.57s -> 898.38s]  Gotta tell you what I did today
[898.98s -> 903.90s]  You gotta just why you were late. Yes, and it's fucking horrible. Listen to me. This is important
[903.90s -> 907.34s]  I wish I could pause e3, you know, I mean we got like we got stuff to talk about the movie
[907.62s -> 911.02s]  So I was in a rush and I fuck this more
[911.66s -> 914.78s]  It's just left for dead again. We've all played it before
[915.18s -> 920.90s]  Okay, we've seen this we all already know that dead deep rock galactic is a better game move on
[921.74s -> 925.80s]  so before I got here, I just got a new deodorant, right and
[926.44s -> 930.00s]  I grabbed it and but without even thinking I
[930.52s -> 935.28s]  Just brand new I took the top off the deodorant because I was in a rush got out of the showers
[935.28s -> 938.60s]  like I gotta get fucking get there gotta get to the movie, right and I ripped the top off and went
[939.64s -> 942.64s]  And scrape with the plastic shit still on it
[943.00s -> 948.82s]  Plastic nub on it and I caused like damage to the underarm here. It was like gotta go gotta go
[950.92s -> 952.92s]  It was horrible I have like a cup there
[953.48s -> 957.80s]  Took me like five minutes to figure out what I was gonna do. Okay, I took you five minutes
[957.80s -> 959.80s]  And that's why you were 30 minutes late
[960.36s -> 964.97s]  Well, I cut my underarm it hurt a lot
[965.49s -> 969.97s]  It was awful. It hurt a shit load
[973.57s -> 977.28s]  All right, what are you doing that?
[977.40s -> 982.94s]  What do I think what I said? I think that
[983.74s -> 989.62s]  Everyone has wanted a left for dead sequel for like 10 years and no one made it and now that they've made it
[989.62s -> 994.42s]  it's outdated and other people have done it better and you could really try deep rock galactic if you haven't or
[996.26s -> 998.26s]  Personal favorite of EDF
[999.94s -> 1004.22s]  No one gives EDF a chance, but they're all gonna play left for dead again
[1006.95s -> 1012.13s]  EDF was fun, but EDF I think that people just don't know what to do about multiplayer anymore
[1012.65s -> 1017.37s]  It's just like I guess four of you have guns and shoot it people running at you
[1017.37s -> 1023.13s]  I would not evolved from like the grab three of your buddies and shoot at people sprinting at you
[1023.13s -> 1025.30s]  I don't know. How how do we do that?
[1027.42s -> 1033.38s]  Do you like this is what I brought up last time last time they showed the e3 for the first time and you know
[1033.38s -> 1038.74s]  Everyone big disarray cuz you got I'm a hard person to agree with. How do you feel about reloading guns?
[1039.32s -> 1043.84s]  Personally, where you stand on this? I think it gives a pause for you to have to stretch each other
[1043.96s -> 1047.80s]  Make sure that you can it's it's a risk and reward
[1048.32s -> 1053.12s]  Okay, so this is why we're good because we're neutrally balanced that I'm gonna disagree with you on everything
[1054.08s -> 1058.14s]  Well, we got all these zombies running towards you who wants to stop shooting them
[1058.14s -> 1061.80s]  That's why doom was so good and everyone loved doom because you can just jump around and keep shooting them
[1061.86s -> 1067.94s]  What is the reload animations and these left-for-dead games are like, okay, shoot you shoot for a second reload for four
[1068.46s -> 1071.14s]  Thanks kid. Can you two shut the fuck up back there?
[1075.22s -> 1082.48s]  Talking the whole movie next question. Do you think DMCA is real or made up? I think DMCA is made up
[1083.10s -> 1084.18s]  Yeah
[1084.18s -> 1088.04s]  No, I don't well then explain this how come
[1088.62s -> 1094.58s]  No streamers have been banned. I don't know because everyone freaked out
[1095.22s -> 1099.10s]  they mute your stream if you have like a portion of this they will mute it and
[1099.50s -> 1103.42s]  Now everyone's saying that I don't know. Why are you fucking up my whole worldview?
[1104.26s -> 1105.79s]  Well
[1105.79s -> 1109.23s]  You're listening to this popular song on your stream right now. Nothing's gonna happen, right?
[1109.79s -> 1112.55s]  Well, they have they have like they've suspended people
[1113.35s -> 1120.09s]  Who name a big streamer? They've suspended. I don't know. Don't pay attention. Fuck. I'm this is I'm terrible at these
[1121.01s -> 1125.83s]  Okay, how did you hear about DMCA claims being an issue?
[1126.35s -> 1134.84s]  Um, it's all like a reddit thread that said hey like they're kind of cracking down and then like twitch came out
[1134.84s -> 1140.72s]  Didn't twitch come on with thing that said that like that like hey, we're like DMC cracking down who told me that
[1145.64s -> 1153.82s]  I swear no, no, dude. I DMCA is but my youtube channel has been fucking strike before but not strike
[1153.82s -> 1157.38s]  But like shit has been what does it have to do with your twitch stream? They mute it
[1157.38s -> 1163.18s]  They mute it if they hold forces of odd. Are you here's the real question? Are you afraid of DMCA?
[1163.18s -> 1167.86s]  I am not afraid of DMCA. I am afraid of having my
[1168.66s -> 1173.96s]  Magical voice muted during a goddamn live stream while I'm talking and listening to music
[1174.66s -> 1180.10s]  Well, it doesn't happen while you're talking. Yes. It does if this music in the background mutes like 12 minutes of your stream
[1181.38s -> 1187.22s]  Yeah, and your VOD which isn't while you're talking. No one watches the VOD. They might do that shit. You never know who knows
[1187.22s -> 1192.86s]  Yeah, but on OBS now you can have your VOD save with a different track than the ones that you streamed with
[1193.54s -> 1198.32s]  Stop talking. Stop talking. This is very important. That was just Johnny Depp dude. Okay, it is. Okay, you're right
[1198.32s -> 1203.44s]  Actually, this is Johnny Depp. Do you remember the first time they showed Sea of Thieves at E3 and we were both like
[1203.44s -> 1206.28s]  This is the fucking game. This is the game changer
[1209.10s -> 1213.64s]  Trying to watch okay, I guess I'm trying to member over here
[1229.80s -> 1233.60s]  Oh, yes, and now one Davey Jones, I
[1240.98s -> 1244.46s]  Believe that now is the perfect time to use these cannons
[1246.02s -> 1248.45s]  This is perfect
[1257.31s -> 1264.75s]  I've never seen a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Well, but the reason why this is perfect because the latest Johnny Depp
[1265.03s -> 1270.39s]  Jack Sparrow shit is like Johnny Depp pretending to be Jack Sparrow. It's it's kind of gotten that far
[1271.95s -> 1280.07s]  So now like he's CG so they're even pretending that the actor is a real person too. So if you see the first day where
[1281.01s -> 1284.87s]  What's his name? Jeff Goldblum came on to announce Jurassic Park
[1286.99s -> 1289.35s]  No, it's worth going back to watch
[1289.35s -> 1294.97s]  I swear he came back and did a parody of himself to make fun of everyone who wanted him to do it
[1294.99s -> 1308.24s]  It was really great. All right. Wait, what's um, all right Johnny Depp now available
[1308.24s -> 1311.80s]  Yeah, should I get Xbox game pass? I feel like it's gonna be worth it at some point soon
[1312.56s -> 1314.98s]  Do you have a computer?
[1314.98s -> 1317.86s]  Yeah, but that's oh
[1318.18s -> 1322.46s]  Okay, do you have I don't know tens of thousands of viewers
[1324.82s -> 1330.28s]  Is your purchasing of games that deductible in taxes
[1331.28s -> 1334.68s]  I'm times. Yeah, I don't think game pass is really gonna help
[1338.14s -> 1342.40s]  Okay, here's the real final question, I'm sorry last one
[1342.92s -> 1349.09s]  Are you going to play a game made later than 1980? Oh, this is people in like diapers on the screen
[1350.57s -> 1357.81s]  What you kusa is this and why have I not played it yet? I want to play this you you would actually love them
[1357.81s -> 1359.81s]  Yeah, I played because zero
[1360.53s -> 1372.19s]  I don't know. Why did some why everyone want me to play the first one zero? Why wouldn't I play that one free alpha gameplay?
[1380.09s -> 1385.31s]  Are you sick of the yeah, what do you think it's cool?
[1389.16s -> 1393.80s]  I'm a huge fan of the in. Um, what was the name of that movie?
[1394.88s -> 1396.28s]  district 9
[1396.28s -> 1398.50s]  That was a really good
[1398.50s -> 1405.98s]  But like cinematic trailer, huh? No. Yeah, I think I think I'm kind of over it. I'm actually kind of let's let's watch
[1406.60s -> 1438.50s]  I'll come on. Oh, hi
[1438.50s -> 1443.05s]  Let's get the buck chance to the chat. Oh
[1443.61s -> 1447.05s]  It's actually it's on the screen. Why are they doing this?
[1447.73s -> 1452.66s]  And it's like ruining the trailer for everybody that wants to do not listen to two dickheads talk over it
[1453.28s -> 1459.48s]  Yeah, let's see some pot. It's like hey, I'm watching this
[1459.48s -> 1485.75s]  I have a confession to make after this trail is over to about how I play battlefield whenever I played it
[1486.35s -> 1494.05s]  Okay, I've never killed one person in one game of battlefield. I don't think once
[1494.79s -> 1499.52s]  Once no, I just kind of walk around and shoot the like weapon at stuff in the air
[1500.04s -> 1503.72s]  Like my assault rifle and stuff at planes and stuff and I pretend like I'm playing
[1504.32s -> 1509.48s]  And I just revive people and then I don't ever play the game again. And like I don't and then people stop inviting me to play
[1515.78s -> 1517.80s]  I
[1517.80s -> 1522.68s]  Mine is actually a little bit similar is I find like a really tall hill and I lay on top of the hill
[1523.28s -> 1525.84s]  And I just kind of watch the battle
[1526.76s -> 1531.56s]  And every one minute I take a shot and like pretend I'm like sniping and like I feel cool
[1531.56s -> 1537.72s]  I don't hit anybody though. So I'm saying I have not killed anyone. So you play battlefield as an idle game
[1538.24s -> 1542.84s]  Well, yeah, like me and my friends we do a full squad and all four of us are on different hills
[1543.12s -> 1549.80s]  Just looking for other people on hills, but nobody really ever gets a shot in also. Are we still in the previews?
[1552.65s -> 1557.11s]  What these are these are games I know but like has this field come on talk yet
[1559.17s -> 1561.17s]  Todd was out talking
[1566.92s -> 1569.24s]  Well, this is not even Xbox this is Bethesda
[1570.76s -> 1576.80s]  Co a group thing. I see I seen this a lot too, but back at you
[1592.38s -> 1595.96s]  Yeah, but I feel like a lot
[1597.01s -> 1599.37s]  This is what I worry about, you know last day
[1600.01s -> 1604.49s]  You're like, hey, let's watch on the last day. You've already seen all these already. I haven't seen anything
[1605.09s -> 1610.82s]  I'm waiting for Elgin, right? You have you have not heard that like Psychonauts 2 is a thing. Well, yeah, but I'm
[1611.62s -> 1613.82s]  But it's closer to being released
[1614.50s -> 1625.43s]  There's three or four new clips in here
[1640.63s -> 1649.01s]  It's like it's actually fun, you know, I asked this question every single time this trailer shows
[1649.85s -> 1652.60s]  Have you ever played it nope
[1659.20s -> 1661.20s]  probably more fun than like
[1661.60s -> 1663.60s]  cleaning a dirty fence I
[1663.64s -> 1669.32s]  Don't know about that going to this game might have too many buttons for you
[1669.88s -> 1672.32s]  You think so? Yeah
[1672.36s -> 1685.81s]  We're getting just bang bang, but reveal reveal reveal
[1686.21s -> 1694.88s]  This is usually the moment when I say hello and welcome to the Bethesda e3 showcase
[1695.04s -> 1701.44s]  We love that we can share this you're not gonna do the Xbox this year and whether you've known Bethesda for 35 years or are just
[1702.32s -> 1704.32s]  35
[1705.32s -> 1707.32s]  35 what?
[1715.00s -> 1720.24s]  That's when you like pat me on the back and you're like good good job Jeremy. Yep. That's how old you are
[1721.28s -> 1728.82s]  I don't know how old you are. I don't know why we're talking what and today bringing ten more titles to game pass for a total of
[1729.78s -> 1735.14s]  You know how old you are Jeremy you're three yes, I'm free like the award-winning doom eternal
[1735.14s -> 1739.68s]  If you're looking for another reason to play it doom maternal will be optimized if you play doom
[1741.96s -> 1748.28s]  That's why you think the reloading is essential this next-gen upgrade will be not every single game has to have no reloads
[1752.24s -> 1758.72s]  Because then every game becomes like the zombie game every game becomes the the two choices that you have to make at oh
[1758.72s -> 1763.98s]  Which one who lives and who dies right that everybody? I don't want to do that. I want everything to be different
[1767.35s -> 1769.53s]  You were just complaining about every game is the same game
[1770.15s -> 1775.57s]  When was I complaining about that you said what it was the very beginning exploring every beginning this frame you said
[1775.91s -> 1780.15s]  No, I said it and then you agreed. I said man. Oh, what's with all these that left for dead clones, right?
[1780.15s -> 1784.47s]  It's a you show four people you said they shoot zombies. No what I said
[1785.47s -> 1791.03s]  Was that there's a better version of Left 4 Dead and you should just play the best version of each genre and that is deep
[1791.03s -> 1796.29s]  Rock galactic, and it's not even debatable everyone who plays this game knows this this is just true
[1796.29s -> 1801.19s]  I forgot our whole conversation already. I have to be honest. I'm just I'm just winging it here
[1801.99s -> 1806.92s]  All right, what is this?
[1812.68s -> 1819.10s]  Do you think they're ever gonna Diablo 3 this game and they'll come out with Reaper souls
[1819.18s -> 1823.48s]  And people it'll be actually kind of fun. I think people are enjoying it that
[1824.14s -> 1826.77s]  still play it
[1826.93s -> 1828.37s]  but
[1828.37s -> 1834.01s]  No one who had the initial impression that they think it's bad is ever gonna go back and like try it again
[1835.37s -> 1840.97s]  It would take years for like a whole new generation of people to just forget what it was like when they launched it
[1842.61s -> 1844.61s]  People saying it's kind of fun
[1844.69s -> 1850.06s]  Yeah, I've honestly not been hearing bad things about it what the launch was, you know
[1850.98s -> 1854.54s]  One of the worst I thought you understood what that insignia meant
[1856.06s -> 1867.83s]  No power another brotherhood. I said this plan in motion and I am the only one who can stop them people like CBT, too
[1870.65s -> 1877.33s]  I'm surprised. That's the kind of comment you would read righteous crusade. Well, it looks like you don't know me very well, do you?
[1877.33s -> 1882.31s]  I guess I don't been watching the stream lately. I don't know. Do you talk about CBT often? I might
[1883.15s -> 1889.31s]  Know I thought CBT was a time zone when people started spamming it like a year ago. Oh really I think I thought it was
[1889.31s -> 1891.31s]  Central British time
[1893.03s -> 1897.96s]  Yeah, never mind I'm not joining now
[1912.07s -> 1914.07s]  It's a follow I
[1934.44s -> 1938.92s]  Would take 30 less trash cans on the screen for this to run at 60 FPS
[1939.56s -> 1942.50s]  And everyone else agree that with that
[1942.78s -> 1952.02s]  Big agree, but there's the games always actually have that mod. Wait. No, I'm not supposed to be agreeing with you
[1952.02s -> 1958.10s]  Oh, I think the the graphical fidelity is worth the loss of frames because I can't see over 24. Anyway
[1958.10s -> 1963.50s]  Studio has now surpassed 18 million players and shows no signs of slowing down
[1963.86s -> 1968.90s]  Right now still going enjoying the new Blackwood chapter part of the gates of oblivion your long
[1968.90s -> 1973.62s]  I feel like the whole Bethesda conference has me been going they're still working on this
[1974.34s -> 1979.18s]  This is still a game. They haven't like liquidated this whole franchise. Like that's what I've been saying the whole time
[1979.18s -> 1986.00s]  So console enhanced this Tuesday the game would deliver a true native experience. I have heard for the series. No, wait, that's
[1986.68s -> 1994.54s]  That's fine. Repeat every single thing you said about fallout 76, but like change the wording to elder scrolls online
[1995.66s -> 2004.20s]  This is the mobile one. No, this is not the mobile. Yes. Look. Yeah, this looks like a mobile game. You tell them
[2004.38s -> 2006.38s]  No, no, no, I just
[2006.78s -> 2012.94s]  Elder scrolls online that was the console one that it was I came on a console right?
[2012.94s -> 2016.62s]  That was a big deal. What came out on console? That was a big deal that it came out on console
[2017.26s -> 2025.06s]  Right a big deal that an elder scrolls game came out on a console. It's an MMO
[2025.06s -> 2031.32s]  It was like an MMO that came out on console again. Are you gonna play any games that have come out after 1980?
[2032.08s -> 2036.43s]  Well, why is every question marking me? What am I talking about?
[2037.07s -> 2045.68s]  Wasn't wasn't when this when this when this first came out wasn't it on console and that was like, oh my god an MMO on console
[2045.68s -> 2054.20s]  No way. Yes. Yeah, it was that was Final Fantasy 14
[2054.84s -> 2058.81s]  Remember you're wrong stop
[2059.05s -> 2069.08s]  That was Final Fantasy 14. I mean like one guy might have said that I don't know if it was a thing
[2069.08s -> 2073.75s]  I thought that's what I thought. That was a big deal. Oh shit. Wait fall guys
[2074.47s -> 2077.29s]  Have they added? No, I'm not gonna be mean
[2077.93s -> 2087.56s]  This is not fall guys
[2087.56s -> 2095.28s]  yeah, if you want to like when you say you don't want to be mean if like a game comes up and you don't like
[2095.28s -> 2096.72s]  It but you don't want to be the one to say it
[2097.44s -> 2101.32s]  You want you want to just send you like a discord message every time I want to say something mean and you'll just say
[2101.32s -> 2106.34s]  No, no, you just ask me. What do you think about this and then I'll say it
[2107.48s -> 2120.64s]  Okay, I don't I don't have a filter. Oh, this actually kind of looks fun. This is that my bad game gang beasts
[2121.16s -> 2124.64s]  Pretty sure this is like gang beast too. Yeah, is it yeah
[2125.24s -> 2131.55s]  This looks like it could be fun kind of fun. Oh shit. This looks really fun
[2132.11s -> 2138.94s]  Well, not actually but yeah, it just looks like gangbeast
[2143.62s -> 2161.04s]  Actually, it's kind of fun. Hey you play this game
[2161.68s -> 2169.50s]  Wait, hold on before I say anything. I want to know what you felt about how you felt about this game
[2170.06s -> 2174.56s]  I felt that okay now go what I just want to make sure I was ready
[2175.44s -> 2177.16s]  Okay, wait
[2177.16s -> 2182.32s]  Why do you need to be ready? Because I just need to be ready. Are you capturing my soul?
[2184.48s -> 2187.96s]  I want to let's hear your thoughts. I want to hear my thoughts on Hades
[2188.60s -> 2196.00s]  Are that I'm really sick and tired of rogue light games requiring you to lose multiple times claiming that it's because their game is hard
[2196.72s -> 2199.64s]  Rather than just that they're gating you from being to
[2200.20s -> 2203.08s]  Accessing the things you need to actually win the game from the start
[2203.32s -> 2207.69s]  You know, we go back to the back in the day gamers who played fucking binding of Isaac
[2207.69s -> 2209.85s]  You could just go beat mom like what's the big deal?
[2210.05s -> 2217.11s]  But nowadays Hades is like you got to play for a couple of hours before you can do plus 300% damage and double your health
[2218.23s -> 2222.52s]  Sorry, I didn't listen
[2223.04s -> 2230.84s]  Essentially that was my game of the year last year. How fucking dare you first of all and second of all was it?
[2230.88s -> 2236.20s]  Yeah, I think it's a good game except for the first part where you need to unlock things
[2236.68s -> 2243.83s]  Here's here's the better example. I think Hades is encouraging the trend
[2243.99s -> 2252.36s]  Have you played the last spell the last spell is a tower defense rogue like but here's the catch
[2252.60s -> 2255.84s]  You can't actually build towers until you've lost a few times
[2256.36s -> 2260.08s]  You'd be a horrible boss to work for I think
[2264.13s -> 2268.09s]  Somebody would come to you with a concept of like a thing that they were making it'd be you'd be like
[2268.67s -> 2271.48s]  Nope
[2271.48s -> 2276.89s]  redo it and then and then they would they would redo it like a hundred times and
[2277.29s -> 2279.69s]  Then you would have already moved on to another project
[2282.79s -> 2288.88s]  Well, I feel like I'm giving I feel like I'm giving actual reasons and not just I'm not just telling them
[2288.88s -> 2296.05s]  No, try again. I feel like I would I would offer some form of guidance, but then you would have the perfect thing
[2296.15s -> 2303.56s]  What's your favorite game of all time?
[2304.04s -> 2311.74s]  Diablo 2 we can agree on that. Well, you're not supposed to be agreeing right now
[2315.38s -> 2317.38s]  Master Chief is back there
[2324.58s -> 2332.79s]  Our goal has always been to bring players together and for the first time we're thrilled to offer our entire
[2333.51s -> 2335.51s]  Quiet right now
[2337.39s -> 2342.31s]  You said quiet there's halo I know and then you waited 20 seconds instead
[2342.31s -> 2347.23s]  Why are we quiet and invite more of you than ever before to become a Spartan hero?
[2347.23s -> 2352.33s]  I'm excited to be here with Joseph Staten the creative
[2353.13s -> 2355.13s]  What's the last halo you played?
[2357.63s -> 2359.63s]  Me and me and Joel
[2360.83s -> 2367.41s]  We played on legendary the the remake remaster one for 40 minutes and it's the only time I've ever played it
[2367.41s -> 2370.17s]  I watched people play it and I was like
[2371.77s -> 2373.77s]  Halo 2 I've never played a halo game
[2382.48s -> 2385.35s]  I don't know. It just never grabbed me for some reason. I don't know why
[2389.27s -> 2391.27s]  Reloading
[2393.15s -> 2398.87s]  Wait, do you reload and halo? Yeah, you do. Of course you do you shoot your battle rifle twice and then you reload
[2398.87s -> 2401.24s]  I mean that this is a huge deal, right?
[2411.36s -> 2413.36s]  I'm very excited
[2418.76s -> 2423.20s]  All right, I was thinking about doing the puke thing I was thinking about going them but I was like I don't want to do
[2423.20s -> 2436.71s]  That right now like people trying to watch you know, I like about Master Chief is he kills relentlessly
[2436.75s -> 2438.75s]  But also it's clear that he cares
[2441.00s -> 2457.39s]  Okay, imagine me like landed on his like head
[2462.49s -> 2464.49s]  That's all that's it
[2467.44s -> 2471.13s]  That's it
[2471.13s -> 2473.05s]  It's too early
[2473.05s -> 2478.96s]  So I need it
[2478.96s -> 2481.68s]  Hey, you know, you know how cool of a boss I would be
[2482.24s -> 2487.97s]  How cool of a boss would you be drama you'd come into my office and it would be like a
[2488.61s -> 2492.29s]  Transparent cup that has levels of like up here
[2492.29s -> 2495.29s]  There's a there's a line that says don't even think about talking to me
[2495.29s -> 2501.45s]  And then when the line is here and the coffees here, it's like maybe listening and then when it's down here the line right here
[2501.45s -> 2504.79s]  It's like now's time not now's time for you to talk
[2506.81s -> 2508.81s]  That's how you know, I'd be a cool boss
[2513.49s -> 2517.20s]  You
[2517.24s -> 2519.80s]  Okay, I don't know how to react
[2521.40s -> 2525.16s]  On successful deployment my deletion routine was supposed to complete
[2528.84s -> 2537.96s]  Good good something stopped your deletion. We need to find that Cortana or a new hollow girl
[2539.64s -> 2545.20s]  Just people this is change people are getting furious with us if we stop we don't stop talking right now no gameplay
[2545.20s -> 2566.04s]  No, bye. Stop talking. Of course. You can't have a halo game without multiplayer and on Xbox Series X
[2566.04s -> 2571.12s]  You'll be able to enjoy infinite's multiplayer action at up to 120 frames per second
[2571.78s -> 2579.54s]  Finally, I'm very happy to announce that halo infinite's first free-to-play multiplayer season and infinite story-driven campaign
[2579.62s -> 2582.00s]  We launched together this holiday
[2582.52s -> 2586.44s]  A new day is this a new generation
[2586.96s -> 2591.48s]  This is halo. I just gotta let you know people are sitting at their table right now
[2591.48s -> 2596.56s]  And they are contemplating whether to give this restaurant of our stream like a two-star review
[2597.28s -> 2600.58s]  Where we're getting there? I was letting you know we all need to be careful here
[2600.58s -> 2602.58s]  I just want to let that person know
[2602.70s -> 2608.18s]  That they're sitting in a virtual restaurant and the only thing letting them like stopping them from going to a better restaurant
[2608.34s -> 2610.34s]  They don't even have to stand up
[2610.62s -> 2615.62s]  They just click the special events where it says that under the stream and then like there's a whole bunch of options
[2616.42s -> 2619.82s]  You can just change the restaurant you're in. Yeah
[2620.58s -> 2624.66s]  Yeah, you said that like a fucking Denny's or something and you just you know what?
[2624.98s -> 2629.44s]  I'm really not into this like French toast grilled cheese. They just gave me
[2630.78s -> 2633.50s]  That one Applebee's you just teleport into the seat
[2634.30s -> 2638.90s]  Yeah, so like they put down the pancakes in front of you at Denny's and you're like how these don't look that good
[2638.94s -> 2643.62s]  You just you switch you switch the channel and there's a new tray of food in front of you already
[2644.98s -> 2651.01s]  But do you have to pay you would have to pay right?
[2651.77s -> 2654.38s]  Not no
[2654.38s -> 2655.94s]  No, maybe no
[2655.94s -> 2657.94s]  so what's stopping somebody from just going just
[2657.98s -> 2663.22s]  What about like the trolls that would just jump from restaurant to restaurant and order everything on the menu and just jump the galaxy?
[2663.22s -> 2664.94s]  Jump to the next restaurant
[2664.94s -> 2666.94s]  The customer is always right. Oh
[2668.14s -> 2675.90s]  right
[2675.90s -> 2700.31s]  Don't just run it all capitalism. Why are they talking? I would probably like payload twos multiplayer
[2701.13s -> 2710.57s]  I thought is this it always looked really fun to me. Well, it's free to play. So you're definitely gonna try it out, right?
[2712.70s -> 2721.38s]  That one looked always the most fun. What about it? Oh, no, just driving the cars around running over people
[2721.38s -> 2727.62s]  Oh, you can't do that in three, but it just seems cleaner. It seemed more fun. I've seen three
[2729.02s -> 2733.54s]  Shut up. I'm serious over Elden ring, right?
[2733.86s -> 2735.86s]  Stop talking. This is my why I'm here
[2735.90s -> 2740.94s]  As the Diablo figure wanders, I know there's five dude
[2741.62s -> 2743.53s]  game of the year
[2743.53s -> 2759.83s]  Must be stopped. It's my fucking like I'm ready
[2760.43s -> 2768.73s]  Are you not excited for this? I heard it's very good
[2771.45s -> 2783.36s]  Wow, I even have mixed feelings about my game of the year joke. I mean it looks great
[2785.36s -> 2788.96s]  It's so close one to one to the actual Diablo 2 that
[2789.44s -> 2796.16s]  The bugs that Diablo 2 has that like speedruns use it kept everything even like really weirdly obscure mechanical things
[2796.56s -> 2801.12s]  Really? So it's it's like as authentic of a remaster as you could possibly get
[2802.04s -> 2810.61s]  Because this is I've I've wanted this for a decade and a half at least
[2811.57s -> 2819.70s]  Well, see my only mixed feeling is that I I never stopped playing Diablo 2 so like a graphical update doesn't even
[2820.34s -> 2824.70s]  But don't you think this is important to remember here don't you think that
[2825.66s -> 2829.54s]  Having a Diablo 2 on the blizzard launcher
[2830.06s -> 2832.70s]  Means we'll get interesting updates to the game
[2833.26s -> 2839.85s]  No, you don't think they'll add stuff to it like items potentially really doubt they would add things to it
[2839.85s -> 2846.72s]  I feel like whenever you add things to a remaster the purists start complaining and then you you're afraid
[2846.90s -> 2852.35s]  Even look like even patches though even stuff that like people have been begging for well
[2852.35s -> 2855.91s]  That's what I mean is that they have bugs from Diablo 2 are
[2856.51s -> 2865.08s]  Remastered to be authentically bugged from like still so if they're not patching that they're not gonna what is happening on this?
[2865.08s -> 2870.72s]  I don't know is this is this by the is this me or is this the this is the stream, but he's my brother
[2871.50s -> 2874.13s]  And I would die remastered
[2875.89s -> 2878.33s]  This is not Diablo, but it just got louder
[2881.45s -> 2883.81s]  Why is this this got like 30% louder
[2884.69s -> 2898.15s]  My only concern would be able to remastered is that Diablo 2 has a whole bunch of mods, and I hope that
[2898.75s -> 2900.75s]  Blizzard doesn't restrict
[2900.75s -> 2904.79s]  Mods being able to make be made of the remastered because otherwise
[2905.35s -> 2908.43s]  To me do like actual Diablo 2 is still just gonna be better
[2909.19s -> 2910.39s]  hmm
[2910.39s -> 2924.18s]  Stir shut up stir shut dude this game came out like two years ago. It's the new games and cinematics no gameplay no buy
[2924.90s -> 2928.90s]  You
[2928.90s -> 2935.78s]  Give a bunch of policies apparently that I didn't know I have a lot of policies no gameplay no buy no chatter left behind
[2936.38s -> 2942.22s]  But what if what can we have one trailer where we don't talk just one this one?
[2942.22s -> 2947.02s]  Okay, ready is like the fourth time. They've shown this game, but this one. Let's just see if we can do it
[2948.58s -> 2950.82s]  But if we're gonna do it why this game?
[2952.58s -> 2954.58s]  Okay, okay
[2955.18s -> 2957.48s]  Let me ask you a question
[2957.52s -> 2966.76s]  When I am dead and Yara is burning, what exactly is your plan whole hands sing songs around the fire
[2991.37s -> 2993.37s]  It really was just like
[2993.49s -> 3000.28s]  I
[3029.64s -> 3039.24s]  Somebody said NBC comedy intro trailer like the music I was gonna say this music is a little oh
[3048.25s -> 3051.58s]  You know that they're killing people
[3053.69s -> 3058.29s]  Whatever happened in games where we honor the death of the fallen I want to play like crazy back, but you
[3059.17s -> 3067.86s]  know this is worse this is like an NBC compilation of all their comedy trailers and like and and and
[3068.18s -> 3074.52s]  Michael walks out just like it's happening. It's happening. Is Ubisoft really gonna make light of revolution
[3086.95s -> 3098.40s]  This is a lot of fun all right don't talk if I called it from the clouds, I'm gonna keep talking
[3099.08s -> 3108.26s]  onto drag knock online
[3108.26s -> 3115.14s]  Everybody's a slime rancher devs. Are you shooting me? Oh, I want a real. I want reaction for this one
[3158.43s -> 3160.43s]  It's too early for that shit
[3160.99s -> 3162.43s]  all right
[3162.43s -> 3164.43s]  Slime rancher was all do you play slime rancher?
[3164.75s -> 3169.65s]  Yeah, I love that would have been my game of the year if I played it when it was actually relevant
[3169.65s -> 3175.32s]  I can like 2017 or something right? Yeah, I think I played it too early
[3175.32s -> 3177.96s]  I never played like I loved it
[3178.96s -> 3183.32s]  When I played it, but it was very good. I'm actually really excited for that. That's I love that game, so let's see
[3195.93s -> 3201.80s]  It's been a while since we have had a real good snowboarding game, right? Oh
[3217.20s -> 3219.20s]  steep yes steep, but steep was uh
[3219.44s -> 3227.68s]  It was more than snowboarding game. It was a wingsuit game. I guess you could count that though
[3227.68s -> 3238.42s]  I get the appeal of snowboarding games and games like this
[3238.42s -> 3244.36s]  But I just can't play them because I end up trying to do a backflip for too long and don't land the third back flip
[3244.40s -> 3250.74s]  I mean, I get way too overzealous with the tricks on the snowboarding game, and I just fall down every time
[3259.08s -> 3266.57s]  You actually get to do that that'd be actually kind of fun if you could be the camera guy I
[3269.03s -> 3271.03s]  Okay, right that one down. I'm serious
[3271.55s -> 3275.98s]  Writing it down as if they if you can be the camera guy then I'm I need to play that
[3276.14s -> 3291.62s]  On my cart, I feel like atomic heart is going to be cyberpunk 2077 without all of the hype
[3294.99s -> 3296.99s]  Maybe better
[3310.37s -> 3322.96s]  This what is this song is it getting you pumped me kinda
[3323.38s -> 3338.21s]  It was 80s Russian pop. What was that? I won. I'm kind of curious about what that was
[3348.68s -> 3353.63s]  Hype meter fog meter just filled up 200. I don't have a fog meter
[3354.15s -> 3370.00s]  Haven't you made this tweet before where you're like, I'm you're one of those people that say you are sick of games that have pixels in them
[3373.23s -> 3378.02s]  Did I I feel like I feel like you've been there
[3378.64s -> 3383.76s]  Maybe because I was shocked that you would have one of the lowest forms of opinion. I
[3385.93s -> 3392.57s]  Think pixel part if done. Well, I'm pixel art can be I think it's like it has a big range
[3393.57s -> 3397.45s]  Yes, it's almost like you can arrange pixels and do like a lot of different things with them
[3397.45s -> 3403.03s]  I mean that this this is look this looks gore. This is gorgeous. Let me just say, okay
[3403.69s -> 3441.41s]  There's a range in pixel art. I'm very interested quiet write that one down, too
[3441.53s -> 3449.35s]  Okay, am I actually I didn't write down the last one. Why didn't I don't even remember what the last one was?
[3449.35s -> 3454.92s]  Why didn't you not write it down? I'll write this one down. What was the other one? I don't remember it was a snowboard game
[3455.06s -> 3459.07s]  No, it wasn't that was the one I told you to write down was a snowboard game
[3459.47s -> 3463.10s]  in the first year of grounded
[3465.15s -> 3467.15s]  Millions of players kept busy
[3469.21s -> 3472.59s]  With crafting it's a billions of players
[3481.10s -> 3487.30s]  Billions
[3490.02s -> 3494.46s]  To celebrate everyone at birth getting an account tied to their ID
[3505.02s -> 3507.94s]  But not those guys
[3511.52s -> 3513.52s]  Why have I never even heard of this
[3520.99s -> 3529.86s]  You should probably turn on arachnophobia mode, oh even her blob scares this of us
[3536.39s -> 3539.40s]  Or never go home
[3540.36s -> 3548.06s]  Oh, honey, I shrunk the kids right. Oh, and it looks like we added achievements to nice
[3549.00s -> 3551.00s]  Okay, I'm writing this one down. I
[3551.04s -> 3556.80s]  Would say this is what Jerma sees every day
[3557.28s -> 3561.10s]  Okay among us to
[3561.66s -> 3576.35s]  Enter the sauce guy. All right, so I'm gonna take a screenshot of this so I can pretend like I played it
[3576.79s -> 3584.40s]  Is that important so you can prove that I was in a different clothing. I threw up my backs
[3584.40s -> 3586.52s]  I just threw my back out. I just literally pulled the muscle my back
[3587.08s -> 3590.22s]  I'm worried about you
[3592.13s -> 3594.13s]  Like if you move you hurt yourself
[3594.13s -> 3600.24s]  Oh, I just pulled a muscle down the left side of my back cuz I've you hurt yourself putting on deodorant
[3600.72s -> 3606.35s]  That was stupid do the face
[3606.95s -> 3614.41s]  No, I did. I need to drink some more water. I got water right here
[3614.93s -> 3620.32s]  Yeah, I know what's happening right now. No gameplay. No, but I
[3621.00s -> 3650.84s]  What is it? I don't know. His stories will be it's like this 2d 3d thing is kind of cool looking though
[3652.68s -> 3654.68s]  Why am I doing that without eating fucking like
[3656.84s -> 3658.94s]  I
[3658.94s -> 3669.45s]  Yeah, and I don't know
[3673.56s -> 3675.56s]  I don't have a reaction for you
[3675.64s -> 3682.39s]  Wait, how did you see that before I did? I thought you were saying and what's your reaction Jeremy?
[3682.39s -> 3687.72s]  I didn't know that no, I'm I have the paid for stream that you actually had seconds in advance
[3687.72s -> 3690.90s]  Yeah, am I actually like 10 seconds behind?
[3692.53s -> 3696.21s]  You could try refreshing like that's better
[3703.17s -> 3705.17s]  No, what
[3705.49s -> 3713.62s]  There's like binaural audio
[3713.82s -> 3716.64s]  Yeah, I feel completely
[3717.08s -> 3719.08s]  explicit and I love the government now
[3719.88s -> 3725.21s]  That's the shit you listen to when like you really want to go to bed before a big event that you're really really excited for like
[3725.21s -> 3729.29s]  The first ever packs being a content creator and you couldn't fucking fall asleep
[3729.29s -> 3731.33s]  It was four or five or six a.m
[3731.33s -> 3737.53s]  And you had to be up at 11 and you just put on binaural beats in both ears fucking so pissed off that you can't
[3737.53s -> 3741.81s]  Go to bed and you just please fucking work so I can be go. I'm like a content creator now
[3742.69s -> 3760.24s]  Didn't work. I mean, I wanted I want to throw up question marks, but a lot of people are plus doing you
[3760.76s -> 3766.48s]  So I just I'm glad I just turned off the webcam right when I spilled coffee all over me. It just went all over me
[3767.32s -> 3782.18s]  You need to live in like in a home. You know what? I mean? I'm fine. Okay
[3783.10s -> 3789.44s]  No, I failed another
[3790.04s -> 3814.14s]  I'm fine. Yeah, I don't know about this game. I'm kind of bored of games taking place like on earth
[3814.78s -> 3817.64s]  You know what? I mean?
[3817.64s -> 3823.84s]  Like the entire universe is boring you so I think I'm just gonna be the opposite again
[3824.12s -> 3829.60s]  And say like any game that takes place on a planet. It's just I think a little overdone
[3829.60s -> 3831.60s]  I think I'm just I think I think we're just too spoiled
[3831.96s -> 3837.62s]  And I mean like there's been so many video games in the last two or three decades that all summer been so good
[3837.70s -> 3844.83s]  That's just like outer galactic exploration. Yeah, we both hate one because this is a planet in space
[3844.83s -> 3846.83s]  So like I'm just I'm over it
[3866.53s -> 3873.25s]  Suddenly and for no reason we added combat goons to our game. We needed shooting. I was intrigued until a moment ago
[3874.81s -> 3879.09s]  But this is but I we said you talked about this last year constant conflict
[3880.05s -> 3883.57s]  It has to be constant conflict
[3884.62s -> 3892.94s]  I think I'm being parody
[3898.85s -> 3902.57s]  Silhouette because the developers haven't finished the design
[3903.13s -> 3912.32s]  Finished the story or finished any gameplay that's actually ready to show in fact, the only thing they have finished
[3913.12s -> 3917.02s]  Is the title?
[3918.06s -> 3926.26s]  Wait, really? Why?
[3932.30s -> 3937.74s]  No gameplay. No, bye. I played the first I played through the whole first one. It was
[3939.55s -> 3947.19s]  Okay, it was fun. I mean that we're getting it too. I feel like they there's isn't a DLC that is still making for the first one
[3947.75s -> 3962.45s]  Yeah, there are. Yep. They are. That's what I mean. Like it's
[3962.97s -> 3977.16s]  It seems pretty this is really close to having a second one. I also feel like
[3977.92s -> 3980.18s]  You would probably like flight simulator
[3980.78s -> 3984.23s]  You kind of really don't do much
[3984.27s -> 3992.28s]  Like a one-button kind of game. What's that supposed to mean? This just seems like the game that you seem to like
[3992.96s -> 3997.38s]  like
[3997.38s -> 4001.01s]  Like those euro truck simulators to you probably really enjoy
[4001.77s -> 4005.93s]  Earth game resident sleeper earth game
[4006.57s -> 4008.57s]  Yeah
[4019.01s -> 4024.77s]  Constant conflict right? Yeah, these planes are in constant cut they're in competition to get there. Do you see how many there were I
[4032.89s -> 4038.37s]  Don't I was I was honestly curious about your opinion and why you would or would not like this and I feel like you just deflected
[4038.37s -> 4043.82s]  I would probably like it. I don't not saying I wouldn't when it came out
[4043.82s -> 4046.38s]  I just don't think I had a good enough graphics card to be able to play it. Oh
[4054.81s -> 4062.69s]  Is this top gun actually might be
[4080.46s -> 4083.98s]  Do it do it do me a favor do me a hit pause on your on your hit pause on your stream
[4083.98s -> 4086.46s]  No, just do it. Just do it. Just do it, but just please do it ready, right?
[4086.46s -> 4089.02s]  Ready pause the pause ready one two three
[4090.22s -> 4092.22s]  four five
[4092.34s -> 4097.04s]  No, I'm back. You were you were not that far behind me. I was I was it really was
[4097.56s -> 4100.12s]  Can we both just press refresh at the same time?
[4100.48s -> 4102.54s]  But I'm
[4102.54s -> 4106.48s]  Capturing the browser. All right. Let's tell me what you see. So am I
[4107.16s -> 4112.22s]  Rain, I see cactuses. I see rocks
[4112.74s -> 4114.87s]  grass a car
[4114.87s -> 4120.66s]  You see how do you see a car? Oh, I'm pausing for like you're so far behind you are so far
[4120.66s -> 4128.46s]  All right. How do I refresh this f5 on all browsers? I'm not I'm not I'm capturing the actual like embedded. Oh
[4129.22s -> 4130.78s]  That's what you mean
[4130.78s -> 4132.78s]  Yeah, no, then I just pause more
[4133.14s -> 4142.86s]  When the splash screen comes up that says like the name of the game like car driver
[4143.98s -> 4145.98s]  Atlantic tell me okay
[4146.54s -> 4159.30s]  Low latency mode. I do have low latency mode on yeah. All right, so the Jeep just went through the outdoor car wash
[4159.74s -> 4167.93s]  Just getting on the road doing things that are gonna get us absolutely arrested pulled over illegal. What else that's the whole trailer
[4167.93s -> 4172.89s]  I think I'm behind you now. Wait, hold on. We'll find out
[4173.61s -> 4194.65s]  Inside the car both of us. They say both paws on the title
[4195.25s -> 4204.33s]  Posing I'm on the title. I'm so far ahead of you. I'm paused on the title. Yeah, I
[4206.46s -> 4211.62s]  Go, I don't think pausing will fix it. Wait, wait, no, no, no, just refresh it. I refreshed. I'm good
[4211.62s -> 4216.06s]  I can't wait to show you what we've been working on. I'm like live now. I think
[4216.66s -> 4220.94s]  Oh your streams live. No, like I think I'm like live like I'm getting the live feed
[4222.94s -> 4224.94s]  Whatever I'll just like delay my reaction
[4225.54s -> 4229.70s]  largest and most diverse open world ever in a Forza Horizon game
[4230.46s -> 4235.34s]  And there is no better car to explore it than the stunning. Oh, what's your opinion on cars?
[4236.82s -> 4244.66s]  Um in unparalleled detail, they did look nice in Forza Vista. Thanks to the power. That's a pretty humble opinion for someone who drives a Ferrari
[4248.04s -> 4255.07s]  I've invited along some of the team to help you I can do that some of the amazing content that's waiting for you in Forza
[4255.07s -> 4257.07s]  Like seriously, that's fucking so annoying
[4261.07s -> 4263.07s]  Hey Mike
[4263.95s -> 4270.45s]  Hey, what's up Mike and we also have Abraham with us as well. He's one of the talented actors who will be appearing in the game
[4272.35s -> 4276.55s]  When you were riding around me fucking sir should have a lot to say about how cool it was and
[4277.87s -> 4280.69s]  Now you want to like talk shit. That's fine. You campaign well
[4284.27s -> 4287.63s]  You made a bunch of comments about the sun roof and how fucking cool that was I
[4288.51s -> 4293.59s]  Mean it was cool. I'm just saying that your opinion on cars is like
[4294.47s -> 4297.19s]  You're really not that into them to be a guy in a Ferrari
[4298.39s -> 4300.39s]  You know, I don't think you appreciate it
[4314.60s -> 4321.66s]  That's a peek at our adventurous campaign but Forza Horizon has always been a game that's best enjoyed with others
[4322.22s -> 4324.86s]  Let's go and see what some of our other players are up to
[4325.58s -> 4329.86s]  The Xbox series consoles allow us to capture every last detail
[4329.98s -> 4333.50s]  What are they up to the individual needles on these cholla cactus?
[4334.02s -> 4336.96s]  What is what you told me to wait a second? I'm like waiting for you
[4338.70s -> 4341.70s]  Because it was like the e3 we're like people talking
[4343.06s -> 4347.28s]  Yeah, cars, but it's like the fake multiplayer like we were talking
[4349.14s -> 4352.98s]  This is one of my favorite things about e3 is when you have the like fake gamer moment
[4353.14s -> 4357.94s]  Especially when you have people communicating over voice and they say all the things that no one would ever say
[4360.66s -> 4368.47s]  Let's watch let's leave Maddie for a moment and head out to the coast and meet Don
[4369.19s -> 4373.99s]  Don is already on the move exploring this idyllic seaside town
[4374.37s -> 4382.03s]  This is a recreation of Mexico that is honest authentic and filled with love. That's why is there somebody fucking gameplay? Oh
[4382.37s -> 4384.09s]  Hey, what's up?
[4384.13s -> 4387.73s]  This is a mural by Mexican artist Farid Rueda
[4388.13s -> 4394.01s]  Just one of the many beautiful faithful pieces of Mexico. You'll find all over for to horizon five
[4397.40s -> 4404.02s]  Like oh, let's check on see what what's dawn up to
[4408.46s -> 4410.90s]  Fuck you doing who are you? Why are you in my game?
[4411.54s -> 4415.46s]  Using photogrammetry data captured on location atop an active
[4415.74s -> 4422.14s]  Mexican volcano the entire world has been recreated at this level of detail. I'm not really feeling this one
[4424.54s -> 4426.54s]  It's just another earth game
[4429.86s -> 4434.46s]  That I just actually looks good consoles, but I mean the actual graphics
[4435.74s -> 4441.46s]  I'm really yeah, I'm very happy that consoles have caught up to what PCs could do like six years ago
[4441.46s -> 4443.46s]  Because
[4443.78s -> 4447.06s]  Games have been looking good lately cities anywhere in the world
[4447.38s -> 4451.66s]  It's a colorful undulating city full of vibrant architecture
[4451.66s -> 4459.02s]  Yeah, even has a sprawling network of tunnels and these twisting turning, but it's a box that you buy once every eight years
[4462.14s -> 4465.78s]  Is usually under four or five hundred dollars the eliminator
[4466.90s -> 4469.62s]  Yeah, but you have to pay for your internet on it separately
[4472.46s -> 4477.94s]  Open-world let's head north to the can we mean the horizon so if you want to play online games
[4477.94s -> 4484.20s]  Don't you need like a PlayStation plus subscription HDR camera rig captured 24-hour shoots?
[4486.20s -> 4488.68s]  Four years if you're paying $15 a month
[4489.52s -> 4491.52s]  How much was it?
[4492.20s -> 4494.20s]  You have to pay for internet no matter what
[4494.68s -> 4501.28s]  Well, why is the internet I'm talking about like a beast computer that can run insane ultra settings is usually more than a thousand
[4501.32s -> 4503.32s]  1500 bucks in it
[4503.80s -> 4509.64s]  Run like a game on like ultra and have it be the look good. You need like a pretty beefy computer
[4512.60s -> 4519.16s]  Not really anymore actually well, okay, you know what I mean, I'm not gonna argue that they aren't more expensive than
[4521.56s -> 4523.56s]  It's actually gone a lot cheaper
[4532.28s -> 4538.72s]  Knows that bill loves minigames so intelligently prompts Sierra to invite bill and 80 I don't have 1080
[4541.80s -> 4546.32s]  With that horizon arcade minigames starting soon all of our players are coming together
[4547.72s -> 4549.72s]  For a second I thought these are people
[4552.84s -> 4554.84s]  Oh gamer track
[4556.72s -> 4560.96s]  Our players now have to work together to find and pop as many as they can
[4561.28s -> 4563.28s]  Okay, go up here to the left
[4569.77s -> 4571.77s]  You know what I figured out about this
[4572.25s -> 4576.41s]  These these people are all streaming the game. That's what I figured out
[4576.41s -> 4578.61s]  We're going over to the stage because when you stream a video game
[4578.61s -> 4583.81s]  This is an inside information you guys you you have to say everything you fucking doing because you're terrified of dead silence is
[4584.53s -> 4587.25s]  Going through the balls incredible. Whoa big turn
[4587.73s -> 4593.51s]  You watch out you don't have to though you do though you do you can be comfortable with silence
[4595.33s -> 4601.13s]  They're all screaming the game they're all making videos streaming I think they'd be louder
[4602.33s -> 4603.49s]  Okay
[4603.49s -> 4605.18s]  Yeah
[4605.18s -> 4608.18s]  Forza Horizon 5 is the largest most fun
[4609.22s -> 4611.30s]  I was gonna make a really specific
[4612.30s -> 4616.86s]  Example reference showcase for the X what it's seven like seven years. I'm just gonna let them go
[4619.14s -> 4623.18s]  Thank you. When is it gonna end? I'll see you all in this. It's a big deal for a lot of people
[4624.02s -> 4636.65s]  Team Xbox is on a mission to bring the joy and community of gaming to everyone on the planet
[4636.89s -> 4641.05s]  That's why you the gamer are at the center of everything we do
[4641.69s -> 4644.17s]  Today we showed you 30 games
[4645.09s -> 4647.93s]  27 of them will be available on Xbox game pass
[4648.49s -> 4652.85s]  Now through the end of the year you can look forward to back-to-back
[4653.25s -> 4654.81s]  Monthly releases
[4654.81s -> 4662.37s]  Landing day one on game pass led by five new titles from Xbox game studios as well as highly
[4662.81s -> 4670.13s]  Anticipated games like back for blood 12 minutes and the ascent and as we look ahead to next year
[4670.13s -> 4675.21s]  I'm inspired by the creativity of Bethesda and Xbox game studios
[4676.25s -> 4680.05s]  We showed you the highly anticipated RPG starfield
[4680.89s -> 4682.89s]  Coming exclusively to Xbox
[4683.29s -> 4689.17s]  But we all know that some of the industry's best RPG storytellers working on about
[4689.29s -> 4697.03s]  They're still making a fable that's not canceled fallout 76. I think so the outer worlds to I mean apparently elder scrolls six
[4698.05s -> 4704.63s]  We unveiled the stunning multiplayer mode for the world's most beloved shooter in Halo infinite
[4705.13s -> 4708.21s]  Adding to the roster of iconic Xbox shooters
[4708.81s -> 4713.65s]  Alongside Wolfenstein years of war perfect dark in doom
[4714.37s -> 4720.81s]  We premiered the most everybody said why is he nodding and listening so intently he doesn't even have an xbox
[4720.81s -> 4726.81s]  You have vibrant and authentic depiction of me. I don't know in a game. What does Xbox games come to PC?
[4728.73s -> 4735.29s]  Ten is hard at work on the next what's the motors also apparently you just love Phil our growing family
[4735.97s -> 4740.81s]  Smart guy studios is devoted to advancing the medium. We all love
[4742.03s -> 4747.19s]  That camera change was perfect has been here for 20 years and that's because of you
[4747.63s -> 4754.69s]  Our team strives to make Xbox a place where you'll find the greatest games the most dedicated
[4755.19s -> 4757.89s]  developers and the most passionate community
[4758.59s -> 4763.07s]  Together we all make Xbox coming up the best place to play
[4764.07s -> 4765.67s]  Before I go
[4765.67s -> 4767.55s]  There's one more thing
[4767.55s -> 4770.30s]  Take a look at this brand new
[4770.94s -> 4778.02s]  Original game from the arcane team at Bethesda the studio that created prey and dishonored
[4779.18s -> 4785.70s]  Arcane created something new for them an open world immersive shooter that you can play alone
[4786.10s -> 4792.42s]  Or with your friends and like starfield death loop this game will be an xbox
[4792.90s -> 4794.34s]  exclusive
[4794.34s -> 4810.96s]  the death loop
[4811.00s -> 4826.56s]  probably
[4839.71s -> 4843.75s]  I'm sorry. I've seen five distinct four distinct characters, but it's about a real
[4853.16s -> 4856.72s]  Piper with a sans eye I'm interested
[4870.97s -> 4880.97s]  Wait is it a four-player shoot the people running at you game
[4897.81s -> 4904.73s]  Redfall Massachusetts behind me. We are witnessing clear signs of cult activity as the locals
[4909.53s -> 4918.69s]  I wasn't why somebody does have to be vlogging. I was just here to record a vlog and I accidentally ended up shooting them all
[4919.97s -> 4923.24s]  America
[4927.97s -> 4934.75s]  It is it's a four-player shoot the people running at you game
[4969.68s -> 4971.68s]  No, let's go off to
[4973.88s -> 4977.92s]  Somebody says can we mute the Diablo 2 nerd that hates everything
[4979.82s -> 4988.67s]  Are you talking about me you're talking about him? I don't know people don't like me you should mute me
[4992.02s -> 4993.66s]  Both of you
[4993.66s -> 5001.08s]  Yeah, I don't hate everything you see my pog face during slime rancher 2
[5001.64s -> 5010.44s]  I'm willing to give arcane studios the benefit of doubt on anything, but like these types of characters. I don't know
[5011.90s -> 5017.90s]  They set a certain tone for a game that I don't expect to like and also by the way, no gameplay. No, but
[5018.38s -> 5031.14s]  This is oh, it's not gameplay. I don't know why I thought this was gameplay. I was like, oh game. It's worked. Oh
[5033.26s -> 5039.10s]  Yes, this gameplay I'm actually really impressed now all in engine footage. This is great
[5039.50s -> 5050.60s]  Every game has to have a sniper. I get it. Every game has the rocket launcher and every Bethesda game has to have a little robot
[5050.98s -> 5056.26s]  Yeah, and it takes place on earth. I know this no no, that's not Bethesda. That's gearbox. What am I talking about?
[5056.82s -> 5071.35s]  Wait, is it there's a little robot in every Bethesda game too. No, I'm thinking of um, what's the game with Peter Dinklage?
[5071.95s -> 5080.90s]  The game with Peter Dinklage. Yeah, it's in the game. Yeah when he replaced him because his voice lines were so bad
[5082.43s -> 5084.43s]  Destiny. Yeah. Yeah
[5084.75s -> 5088.15s]  That's a little remind me that just every time I see like a little robot, dude
[5088.59s -> 5095.24s]  The one the first vampire guide looked like the outsider
[5096.34s -> 5097.62s]  from
[5097.62s -> 5099.94s]  Dishonored I was confused. I thought they were doing like
[5100.62s -> 5106.44s]  Like a PlayStation all-stars mashup and that robot was from like some game. I don't know
[5111.36s -> 5117.81s]  Destiny's fun though, isn't it? Oh, just nice fun though in it. It is. No, it's I'm serious. Like isn't it?
[5117.81s -> 5125.35s]  I played the first one for a little bit. It was fun to shoot stuff
[5125.63s -> 5132.08s]  You know for all the people that are that are like, you know, sir, you're annoying. Yeah, destiny 2 is a great game
[5139.14s -> 5142.54s]  It was even more annoying that he didn't complain about it
[5143.34s -> 5149.86s]  Honestly, I picked the wrong person to stream this conference. But I want something. I want something that's like oh shit
[5150.78s -> 5153.82s]  I mean, I asked you if you wanted to so it's my fault
[5155.14s -> 5162.28s]  Just hates everything. He's bashes everything. He's one of those BP bashes. He's angry
[5163.16s -> 5175.28s]  Some of this stuff does look pretty good. I mean age of it. That's it. Is that a remake?
[5175.80s -> 5181.29s]  It is right age of empires. No, actually, I think it is the
[5182.33s -> 5186.93s]  The thing that most interested me this entire conference
[5187.65s -> 5194.59s]  Was them saying we're still working on a fable and they didn't even show it since when are they working on fable?
[5195.03s -> 5198.94s]  I think I think he was just saying that they're like currently working on it
[5199.22s -> 5203.94s]  Yeah, but it was like the briefest of name drops of like I am we're working like we what?
[5204.82s -> 5208.50s]  Yeah, but how long has it been? Holy shit. We've been here for an hour and a half
[5209.34s -> 5210.75s]  Yeah
[5210.75s -> 5213.29s]  Wait, what?
[5213.29s -> 5219.68s]  How did that go by that my brain that did not process that an hour a half has gone by time goes by fast when you're
[5219.68s -> 5221.68s]  Just having lots of fun
[5221.92s -> 5226.49s]  That I've been having no fun with you. That's the thing. I've actually hated every second of being this
[5226.49s -> 5230.05s]  I think that I think that you're being you're playing coy and you've had so much fun
[5230.97s -> 5237.23s]  So what what's what's the what's the big one? I feel like I missed everything
[5238.11s -> 5244.44s]  What do you mean you I missed everything the big one they started with starfield
[5244.62s -> 5254.98s]  Yeah, but that was an hour and a half ago. So you forgot you missed Elden Ring. No, I'm just kidding
[5254.98s -> 5260.66s]  I saw the trailer that looks fucking awesome. Yeah. All right, wait, we gotta talk about elder Elden Ring for a second
[5261.30s -> 5263.62s]  Am I to be am I wrong here?
[5263.62s -> 5271.04s]  It's it's an open world from software like Dark Souls game like open like complete or is it because don't mean Dark Souls is open
[5271.04s -> 5273.56s]  World technically right but like a big open world
[5275.97s -> 5280.37s]  Supposedly and you get a horse but why they give you a horse if you didn't have somewhere to go
[5280.37s -> 5284.25s]  Why are they making that such a point because all the other Dark Souls games were kind of open world, weren't they?
[5284.33s -> 5290.49s]  They've not really they were open in that different paths connected to each other, but they weren't actually open
[5290.49s -> 5294.85s]  I can't imagine how crazy they've been an open world Dark Souls kind of game
[5294.85s -> 5302.47s]  It has open fields, but it still has some the same dungeons like Dark Souls
[5302.47s -> 5305.71s]  I don't know
[5305.83s -> 5310.91s]  Well, but here's something really important about about the guy in the call right now the last from software game that came out
[5310.91s -> 5312.91s]  He didn't finish but I did
[5313.03s -> 5322.03s]  Which one was the last one? It's Kero. Remember you did not beat the last boss in secure. Oh, you were like this game's dumb
[5322.03s -> 5324.03s]  I don't want to even complete it. You're
[5324.79s -> 5329.71s]  You're bringing up games that are the most likely to make people not like me
[5330.71s -> 5333.40s]  Hold on. I guess for this add-up
[5333.44s -> 5337.83s]  I'm getting flashbang by the screen being open. So wait
[5338.19s -> 5344.15s]  Well, hold on the next one is Square Enix at 12 15. What time is that what that's like?
[5344.15s -> 5350.03s]  That's in like 45 minutes from now. Yeah, okay. So we've got a lot to talk about for 45 minutes a huge recap
[5350.03s -> 5353.09s]  I actually I don't know if you wanted to keep talking about that
[5353.09s -> 5357.75s]  I don't know if I'm interrupting but I know that like I was saying earlier, this is my this is my big break
[5357.75s -> 5360.03s]  I don't normally have such
[5360.63s -> 5365.43s]  High caliber celebrities on my stream and I'm kind of trying to make it as a journalist
[5365.43s -> 5369.91s]  So I actually wrote up a bunch of interview questions for you and it would be an honor if you would allow me
[5370.35s -> 5375.39s]  To interview you no. All right. So what did you think about?
[5375.91s -> 5382.81s]  What do you what what do you think about me beating secure? Oh before you I didn't beat it at all
[5382.83s -> 5385.85s]  So I don't really I don't think anything
[5387.61s -> 5391.70s]  Congratulations, nobody said getting the sus guy is pretty big
[5391.90s -> 5400.54s]  So what what was in that conference that you thought was that you were interested in?
[5402.46s -> 5404.59s]  Babel
[5405.35s -> 5410.63s]  All right, you wrote down you know replaced I wrote it down snowboard cameraman I wrote that down
[5410.63s -> 5415.12s]  I wrote I don't know why I wrote that down. Why did you write among us? I just
[5416.32s -> 5422.58s]  Sweeping the nation. So wait, what was the among us thing was that they they're adding more lobby slots
[5422.58s -> 5427.23s]  Wait, so is it okay for you to interview me? I don't want to interview you
[5427.23s -> 5431.15s]  I don't what you are you you are interviewing me. You're not a question
[5431.15s -> 5435.39s]  I have what would I even ask you like I don't you just asked like three in a row
[5437.79s -> 5440.75s]  But this it's we're talking about the games we just
[5441.15s -> 5444.27s]  Watched not about like what you had for dinner last night
[5444.43s -> 5450.58s]  that was not one of the questions, but you know, um, I like the camera the cameraman snowboard game could be funny because
[5451.06s -> 5455.70s]  You know the laugh-out-loud moments of being able to take the camera and watch like you like snow snowboard down
[5455.70s -> 5457.50s]  I don't know why it's you it's not gonna be you
[5457.50s -> 5462.74s]  It's gonna be somebody else way more interesting than you but like it's gonna be filming somebody like a hilarious other streamer
[5462.98s -> 5469.04s]  Going and like crashing and jumping over somebody and stuff. You know, I mean I need I need the
[5469.28s -> 5470.40s]  old-person
[5470.40s -> 5475.84s]  Recap, I'm like clicking to the stream what you didn't hear what I just said. No, no, I heard what you just said
[5475.84s -> 5478.68s]  I'm looking like what games they showed that I miss
[5479.30s -> 5485.10s]  Understand because like there was a couple things that seemed interesting, but everything that seemed interesting had no gameplay
[5485.18s -> 5489.10s]  Which is kind of typical e3. I'm curious about the arcane
[5489.50s -> 5492.79s]  Studios because our game studios has never made a bad game
[5492.99s -> 5498.63s]  But I don't know what they were showing because there was no gameplay. It's gonna be like
[5499.51s -> 5503.63s]  Shooter four-player, that's very presumptuous of you. It's a
[5504.99s -> 5511.52s]  You're jumping to conclusions here, Jerma, even if it's and I feel like you're not being fair to the developers
[5511.52s -> 5515.70s]  I always try and give it there. All right, hold on. But what what what did you said arcane studios?
[5515.70s -> 5519.22s]  What was the last thing they made?
[5519.46s -> 5526.56s]  Prey was the last okay, so they make good games. Yeah, they make prey to make dishonored. Oh, okay
[5526.64s -> 5530.72s]  So, yeah, they probably they're probably all right and they're they're making death loop
[5530.72s -> 5533.28s]  But I think this would be the actually the first time that they have
[5534.09s -> 5541.36s]  Made two games at once because I didn't expect a second game. Also Dark Messiah a very good game
[5541.36s -> 5550.00s]  That is a very good game. I'm just kidding. Yeah, but if you want to play the snowboard game, I'll film you. Oh, okay
[5550.00s -> 5554.87s]  Yeah, no, okay. No, that's fine. I'll do the snowboarding you do the camera. Yeah, it was just kidding around
[5556.50s -> 5560.34s]  Something for blood darkness. I might I would love to see another one of those wouldn't you?
[5560.46s -> 5565.10s]  Yeah, I would love any I would like a heroes of might and magic game that
[5565.86s -> 5571.36s]  Was the last one they even made they've made a bunch of them
[5571.72s -> 5578.02s]  But even you just haven't heard of them because they were not very good. Why are you pretending to play games?
[5578.02s -> 5580.38s]  I know that is what I'm doing cuz I don't
[5582.58s -> 5586.94s]  I mean, there's 22,000 people here. I have to at least pretend like I fucking know what I'm doing
[5586.94s -> 5589.89s]  I have to we have to say I have to sit with like a hand on my to be like
[5589.89s -> 5597.38s]  Let me tell you something. That is not why people are here, right?
[5597.38s -> 5603.90s]  You know if they wanted to go to Applebee's they just switch the channel you have to be comfortable
[5603.90s -> 5610.68s]  Silence sometimes I am comfortable with silence. But did you see that? It was like a dust cloud that just went by the camera
[5610.68s -> 5622.15s]  That was crazy. Uh, no, I don't have it open. We want the dump truck. We're here to see you. Oh, thanks
[5622.15s -> 5633.08s]  No, thank you. Seriously. Thank you Applebee's Andy. You're looking cute today. You lost weight
[5633.22s -> 5637.08s]  I've gained a lot of weight actually like a hundred and sixty
[5639.42s -> 5644.34s]  Okay, too much weight. Oh, yeah, I haven't stood up on I haven't stood up on camera for a while
[5644.34s -> 5650.57s]  I actually know that's versions of me have how it way that really like okay
[5650.57s -> 5654.77s]  Jarvis short jokes, but to hear that you're you gained a ton of weight. You're 160
[5654.85s -> 5660.49s]  We're going with this that math doesn't that's weird to me that you could be like, oh, yeah
[5660.49s -> 5662.97s]  I'm up a whole bunch. I'm a hundred. That's like nothing
[5662.97s -> 5670.53s]  I'm not I'm how short do you have to be for like I've gained a bunch of weight and you to be 160 pounds to be
[5670.53s -> 5676.26s]  Like oh, it's not how it's getting bad. I'm five like eight, you know, how tall I am
[5676.30s -> 5684.60s]  Why is this such a mystery? Well, that's I'm just saying that's the first time it has actually hit me as like I'm on board with this joke
[5685.78s -> 5691.54s]  There is no job. I'm five eight and a hundred and sixty fat guy pounds. Like I need to lose
[5692.54s -> 5694.54s]  160 cannot be fat
[5695.34s -> 5700.62s]  Seven to five eight and I'm gonna say that range because it depends on what kind of shoes you have on if you have dress shoes
[5700.62s -> 5702.62s]  On I become five eight and a half without
[5703.30s -> 5708.02s]  You're a dwarf without dress shoes. I'm like five seven and two quarters or something
[5708.06s -> 5715.53s]  I have to have dress shoes on my chat, which is scientists very intelligent people
[5715.53s -> 5718.29s]  This guy's saying 160 at your height is perfectly healthy
[5718.85s -> 5728.90s]  Are you always this down on yourself?
[5729.02s -> 5733.85s]  If you have fucking dress shoes on you get a little taller
[5734.41s -> 5737.42s]  Wait, how tall are you?
[5737.62s -> 5743.22s]  Six two. Yeah, right. What do you mean? Yeah, right? You're like again. You've seen me
[5743.22s -> 5746.43s]  Oh six one. You're like six feet on a good day
[5747.43s -> 5753.19s]  By the way, who gives a shit about any of this? What did you think about the fucking fable conference?
[5753.19s -> 5757.80s]  I think it was really cool that for about one second
[5757.80s -> 5763.69s]  They showed a sword and apparently that sword is in fable. Yeah, we can we can we move on to something else?
[5763.69s -> 5766.37s]  I mean, this is making me a little nervous talking about how tall I am
[5766.69s -> 5770.96s]  What did you see the first conference? Did you see yesterday?
[5770.96s -> 5775.38s]  I didn't we could watch yesterday's stuff cuz I haven't seen any of it. No, I've seen that shit
[5775.38s -> 5778.28s]  It was fucking cool. Some of the stuff was cool. You really should check it out
[5778.44s -> 5784.93s]  Yeah, I was going to wait because you were like, I'm only gonna stream on Sunday and I was like, oh, okay
[5784.93s -> 5788.98s]  I'll just like I'll cue it all up for him
[5790.13s -> 5797.73s]  And but this is this is what like all the big reveals are like Xbox the Xbox. No, that's when that typically happens
[5797.89s -> 5810.50s]  They typically happen on the first day. Let me go take a break. I have to go to the bathroom. Um, yeah, when's the next one?
[5811.06s -> 5812.50s]  well, 15
[5812.50s -> 5817.30s]  12 15 we got a we have to kill a lot of time here. What are we gonna? What do we do?
[5819.04s -> 5830.00s]  I don't know shit. How do I how do we kill like 30 minutes? This is like 45 minutes. I don't know ma'am
[5830.00s -> 5833.14s]  What can we even play?
[5834.64s -> 5846.61s]  Among us. I'm not playing the minus. I'm not playing wait, you know what? No. No, it's the only time I'd ever play it
[5847.05s -> 5851.75s]  It's a bit me and you what are we gonna? I who is the imposter you you killed me
[5851.93s -> 5859.47s]  That's how you do it. The reason why I don't play among us and the reason why a lot I I'll give you the reason
[5859.79s -> 5862.51s]  I don't I don't know like
[5863.19s -> 5867.67s]  10 streamers to be like hey you guys ready to play among us. No, I don't I'm not gonna do that
[5867.83s -> 5872.87s]  Well, then you're gonna get involved in the streamer drama. I know like four people
[5872.87s -> 5889.73s]  I mean I could ask people on Twitter just ask people on Twitter what I don't like. Okay, here's thing
[5889.73s -> 5891.17s]  I don't really want to play though
[5891.17s -> 5895.81s]  I don't really like care that much about among us to like hit up a bunch of people and be like hey
[5895.81s -> 5906.74s]  I want to play among us today. Can you and can I be in? Oh, yeah, that's another thing
[5906.78s -> 5910.90s]  Talk about so I'm gonna I'm gonna be do it. I guess I'm talking about tomorrow
[5911.72s -> 5913.60s]  I'm gonna be on
[5913.60s -> 5921.25s]  OTK schooled you just making up letters. What? Oh, I'm gonna be I'm gonna be on schooled
[5921.25s -> 5926.56s]  It's a it's a like a game show. Oh, check it out. It's a it's a it's gonna be fun
[5927.20s -> 5931.38s]  It's a it's a game where you go through 12 grades
[5931.48s -> 5937.20s]  You start it like kindergarten you go grade one grade two grade three and if you get three questions wrong, you're eliminated
[5937.78s -> 5941.34s]  I hopefully I make it past the second grade. I really I'm very concerned
[5941.34s -> 5946.68s]  I've actually been studying like the periodic table and like math and shit cuz I'm stood
[5946.68s -> 5949.48s]  It's been like 20 years since I've been in a fucking classroom
[5949.72s -> 5954.82s]  Yeah, when you're in school and you're young they don't teach you that you don't actually need to know any of it
[5954.82s -> 5959.12s]  I really hope I get this past like the fifth grade or something
[5959.12s -> 5965.24s]  I think is that's like okay, right getting to like the sixth grade in a game show at least it's like alright
[5965.72s -> 5974.71s]  Seventh and eighth grade science questions are kind of they can be really specific, right? Yeah
[5974.71s -> 5983.31s]  I do could you beat yourself, you know, you used to do the uh, what did they call it in school the
[5984.12s -> 5991.34s]  The fitness awards and gym every year. Yep. They're gonna make you beat your like your times on the
[5992.62s -> 5996.62s]  You can do never tell the story about how I tried to run the mile as fast as I could and I end up like
[5996.74s -> 5999.98s]  Puking and they had to put me in a wheelchair and we and I had to go through like the halls in my school
[6000.38s -> 6006.81s]  I haven't heard that no, I like I've told that story. Yes. Okay. I'm just making sure I've told it
[6006.93s -> 6010.76s]  Okay, I was so desperate. I think you just told it again
[6010.76s -> 6015.32s]  I did but like I just so badly wanted to I don't know why I just
[6015.90s -> 6020.02s]  Decided I was gonna run the mile and try to get it as fast as I could or do it as best as I could
[6020.02s -> 6023.62s]  And I think like six or seven minutes was oh wow
[6024.04s -> 6027.72s]  You get your name written down in a book if you go like six or seven minutes
[6027.72s -> 6030.88s]  And I was like I'm going for it and then I it was awful
[6030.88s -> 6035.84s]  I felt awful. I wasn't really prepared for it. I ended up like puking behind a tree. I couldn't really walk
[6035.84s -> 6042.66s]  I was so fucked up that the teacher like the phys ed teacher had put me in a wheelchair and I it was it was just awful
[6042.86s -> 6045.38s]  But here's one thing I'm really good at in that shit
[6045.38s -> 6050.90s]  You know the one where you sit down and you put your feet against the box and you have to put your arms out
[6050.90s -> 6052.90s]  And go help them lean forward
[6053.66s -> 6056.94s]  No, no, how far how far on the line you can put when you put your hands on top
[6056.94s -> 6059.84s]  You guys know what I'm talking about the sit and reach. Yep. I am
[6060.40s -> 6065.12s]  Reekishly good at the sit and reach because I have really long long arms and fingers and
[6065.88s -> 6067.64s]  Like a really long body
[6067.64s -> 6074.75s]  So I'm able to just like go like this and just I beat everybody's record when I was young
[6074.75s -> 6081.97s]  I could do that position the reach I could put my nose on the ground. I can barely reach my knees now
[6081.97s -> 6089.09s]  What happened put your nose on the ground wouldn't you know like if you put your feet out in front of you and like lean forward?
[6089.09s -> 6097.99s]  Yeah, like I could stretch enough that I could put my face on the floor what yeah
[6099.84s -> 6113.08s]  Yeah, what what what's the problem? Oh?
[6116.20s -> 6128.37s]  Are you good? Oh, I see where this is going. I see I understand where this is going now
[6129.43s -> 6131.92s]  You have sexual comedy
[6132.28s -> 6139.16s]  Like what the fuck are you talking about you could seriously lean down you could put your face on the ground
[6139.16s -> 6144.48s]  Is that what you're telling me? Yes. No you fucking no way. You know, what are you talking about?
[6146.50s -> 6153.44s]  That's what I'm talking about you're telling me while you're sitting if you were Steve Wow back you could lean forward
[6154.00s -> 6159.00s]  All the way and have your face touch between your legs and hit the ground
[6159.00s -> 6167.69s]  Well, I mean like my body would go forward so like not like not like that close
[6167.69s -> 6168.81s]  There's what you're talking about
[6168.81s -> 6173.93s]  But yes, like if I leaned and tried to do the like touch your toes I could get my face to the ground
[6175.93s -> 6180.73s]  I lived it
[6185.74s -> 6189.68s]  Like okay, we gotta move on because I'm gonna get stuck on this
[6196.74s -> 6203.44s]  Everything's fine. Everything's fine. I'm just I lived it. Are you jealous? No, I just can't
[6204.12s -> 6210.28s]  Understand I can't believe that what you're describing is something that everybody says is impossible
[6211.04s -> 6213.04s]  But the stop somehow
[6213.20s -> 6216.00s]  You put your face on the ground between your legs
[6216.44s -> 6223.48s]  Do you understand like how that's not even you make it doesn't make any sense what you're saying
[6225.16s -> 6230.24s]  There's no way you were able to do that this no way you're able to do that this I don't believe it
[6230.24s -> 6232.24s]  I I refuse to believe that's possible
[6232.64s -> 6238.88s]  You could probably look up a Google like a video right now and react to it live on stream
[6238.88s -> 6243.32s]  Like someone stretching and do it like I've seen videos of people doing crazier stuff than that
[6255.61s -> 6259.38s]  Okay, do you not like those kinds of videos
[6260.10s -> 6270.39s]  I think it's time we take a quick break and get a little bit of water refill some coffee and get prepared for the
[6270.39s -> 6277.35s]  What's the next conference is coming up next Square Enix coming up next probably anime games and you know growing up
[6277.35s -> 6280.95s]  I was just always told that people like, you know, yeah flexible boys. Oh
[6283.15s -> 6291.02s]  My god, I just muted him. I mean I muted him. I I'm on his stream, but he's not on mine
[6291.28s -> 6302.45s]  Yes, you are. You're muted on my stream respond to you still. Okay, I'm gonna
[6303.01s -> 6317.43s]  Okay, I've got to start screening your comments, okay, go ahead and tell me we've got not true
[6317.43s -> 6320.03s]  We thought like at some point you were like, oh, you know what?
[6320.03s -> 6324.23s]  I'm gonna put like the actual like 18 plus on the channel and I'm gonna start saying swear words like damn
[6324.43s -> 6330.43s]  There is there is a mature audience morning on this channel. Yeah, so why can't I talk about being flexible?
[6330.45s -> 6336.08s]  It's it's it's the way you do things. You know what I mean? It's the way you do things
[6336.12s -> 6344.20s]  It's the way you it's the way you do it. Okay, so let me ask you this. I'm screening it good
[6344.24s -> 6349.69s]  All right, let me know I'm sorry. I'm screening it right now
[6349.99s -> 6366.24s]  Say that again if you had to if you absolutely had to I'm screening the rest of this
[6366.52s -> 6373.85s]  To be so say that one more time if you had to bleach one part of your body, what would it be?
[6373.85s -> 6382.56s]  I'm here. I don't know. But what are you talking about? Like? All right. I'm come. All right. He's muted. He's gone. He's muted
[6383.20s -> 6387.56s]  We're gonna I'm gonna take a break. We're gonna go pee. I might grab this more coffee
[6387.76s -> 6390.72s]  This is gonna this would be like a five-plus minute break
[6390.72s -> 6395.36s]  Okay, like I'm not gonna turn the stream off but like there's nothing gonna be here. What are you you agree with that?
[6395.60s -> 6402.44s]  What did you just say? I just said like let's take a five-minute break a five-minute
[6402.44s -> 6405.82s]  I'll get like a coffee cuz I mean we got like another like 20 30 minutes
[6405.84s -> 6412.05s]  I'm I'm like young and spry enough still that I don't need to get coffee. So I'm I'm still just gonna be here
[6412.05s -> 6421.60s]  All right. Well, I don't I just I'm not gonna be here for like at least five minutes. Okay. Well, are you are you muting me?
[6421.60s -> 6424.18s]  I just want to make sure that I don't like say anything while you're gone
[6424.44s -> 6430.06s]  Okay, just came out of my nose. I gotta go
[6430.38s -> 6435.33s]  Alright and turn off your stream too. I don't want you to talk about me. Okay
[6439.08s -> 6441.58s]  All right, I'll be right back I'm back in like five minutes
[6444.21s -> 6446.96s]  we're gonna do Square Enix and
[6447.00s -> 6454.97s]  Hopefully we don't talk about stir being able to lean forward far enough to touch the ground, right? Okay
[6455.61s -> 6458.49s]  Well, I will be right back after these okay
[6458.49s -> 6463.29s]  I want to say that this was also like second or third grade. So you're making it I okay
[6463.41s -> 6471.28s]  Goodbye. Good fucking bye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. I'm going I'll bring it back. Goodbye. Oh my god
[6471.28s -> 6482.30s]  I'll be back. I thought you were talking about like like now like like recently. Oh my god
[6482.30s -> 6485.98s]  I'm out get back. Stop. Stop. Stop it. Stop. I'm out of here. I'm out of here
[6485.98s -> 6514.90s]  I'll be back in five minutes. I need to unmute him cuz we didn't talk about this. I thought you were saying
[6515.28s -> 6521.12s]  Yes, I was able to do that maneuver and go boy. I got I got that maneuver up there somewhere
[6521.16s -> 6523.28s]  I thought you meant like you have that maneuver
[6523.28s -> 6529.12s]  It's something that you like developed and be able to able to do when you were younger and it's like something you could still do
[6529.12s -> 6530.20s]  I
[6530.20s -> 6534.36s]  Specifically said I used to be able to do this and I can't even reach my own knees now
[6534.36s -> 6539.72s]  I was I didn't even hear the second part of that sentence. Okay
[6539.72s -> 6545.72s]  I think that you just have like a prejudice against me where you expect the things that I say to be things you don't want
[6545.72s -> 6548.64s]  To hear and that you don't actually give me the floor to speak
[6549.56s -> 6553.20s]  And you don't really consciously accept what I'm talking to you about
[6554.47s -> 6556.47s]  I don't know my fucking like
[6556.83s -> 6561.33s]  My brain thought that like this is so are you know? All right. Goodbye. I'll be back in five minutes
