[2.94s -> 14.02s]  Hold on. I don't know what I did with my drink. My tea is the most important thing on stream.
[18.02s -> 29.88s]  My green tea or energy drink that I have here is my Spider-Man Iron Man suit. I- I'm sorry.
[29.88s -> 75.26s]  I need it. Be right back. Peter, if you're nothing without the suit, then you're nothing at all.
[75.90s -> 85.64s]  Peter, if you're nothing with- without the green tea, then are you really Spider-Man?
[85.64s -> 95.38s]  Yeah, I still am. It's a drink. I'm fine. Shut up. It's literally green tea. I'll be- I-
[95.38s -> 110.58s]  I am Spider-Man. Who am I even arguing with? Yeah, people- Oh, Popeye. When Popeye breaks
[110.58s -> 114.26s]  open the spinach can, he eats the spinach. Iron Man didn't walk onto the set and go,
[114.26s -> 116.90s]  hey, Popeye, if you're nothing without the spinach, you're nothing at all.
[117.72s -> 121.48s]  No, Popeye said it's a nutritious fucking thing and I can- I'm gonna knock your lights out,
[121.56s -> 137.29s]  actually. Who are you- what is he talking about? Do you guys not know what I'm referring to?
[141.30s -> 156.30s]  I thought you guys watched Marvel movies. What? You don't know? I think they're doing this on
[156.30s -> 167.11s]  purpose. Yeah, see, I understand. Somebody does. That's from Homecoming. Yeah. Wait, is it? What
[167.11s -> 178.34s]  movie is that from? That's from Homecoming, right? Yeah, it is. Okay. Anyways, hi, guys. How you
[178.34s -> 184.02s]  doing? We're gonna be playing some Slime Rancher 2 today. It came out. It's in technically early
[184.02s -> 196.65s]  access. I liked the last one. I thought the last one was great. So why not try the other one?
[197.29s -> 207.58s]  How was my birthday? My birthday was great. I had a really good time. Yeah, once you get over 30,
[208.38s -> 213.10s]  your birthday just is a birthday kind of- it's not like, oh my god, we're gonna- oh,
[213.10s -> 217.98s]  wear birthday hats. And there's gonna be like a bunch of cake stuff. Well, I actually-
[217.98s -> 236.14s]  Holly did make me a cake. So, excuse me. That happens at 40. That was a nice day. The big
[236.14s -> 245.05s]  everybody needs to show up is 40. If you're invited and you don't show up to my 40th birthday,
[246.47s -> 257.85s]  I may have to cross you off the friends list. Because I mean, really? 40. I don't care if you
[257.85s -> 267.35s]  miss 31 through 39. That's 40. And I'm gonna be doing it in the McDonald's fucking place.
[273.70s -> 278.58s]  Somebody just said in pre-stream, he's gonna be really sus today, I can tell. And like, fuck,
[278.58s -> 282.34s]  I have been. I've been like saying weird shit for the first like 10 minutes.
[283.72s -> 286.60s]  Why did you know that? Why did you know that I was gonna be really sus today?
[287.40s -> 304.25s]  You must- I don't know. Somebody must have had some vision or something. But yeah, 40 is when
[304.25s -> 312.76s]  I'll care. Every birthday from 31- okay, you freak out when you hit 30. And then it just doesn't
[312.76s -> 322.89s]  matter. At 31 and 32, you're kind of just, I don't really care. 40 is the next big one where
[322.89s -> 327.61s]  it's, you know, this is zero at the end. It's like, oh shit. Okay, this is another one. Another zero.
[328.33s -> 341.86s]  But I appreciate all the birthday wishes I saw. There's a lot of cool artwork and people saying,
[341.86s -> 348.18s]  at birthday, thank you. It surprises that many people on the internet who would
[348.90s -> 352.58s]  say that to some random guy who has gone on record talking about
[353.99s -> 360.38s]  putting baseballs up his ass. So, I mean, thanks. I appreciate it. I hope we can have a good time
[360.38s -> 383.05s]  still today. Here's to 39 more baseballs. But that's implying that I'm 39. I'm 37. You got
[383.05s -> 390.31s]  it wrong. Actually, I would much rather people think that I was older. I kind of pre-bake
[391.11s -> 395.11s]  my birthday. Does anybody else do this? Maybe you do this when you're after 30.
[395.99s -> 402.31s]  But I have been telling- oh, how old are you? Oh, and I'm 37. Even though I wasn't. Just because,
[402.31s -> 408.23s]  like, I need to prepare for being older. So now, maybe like six to seven months from now,
[408.23s -> 411.27s]  I'm just going to be like, yeah, I'm like, you know, I'm 38 pretty much. I'm turning 38. I'm
[411.27s -> 416.70s]  probably 38 soon. 38. So then when I'm actually 38, it's like, oh, I've been saying- it doesn't
[416.70s -> 424.92s]  matter. I'm prepared for it. I do that too, kind of. Yeah. All right, let's go. Slime Rancher 2.
[425.56s -> 437.56s]  Welcome, everybody. I do that too. Yeah, it makes it easier. It makes it more palatable for your
[437.56s -> 452.78s]  brain. Just say you're 40 now and prepare for it. I don't know if I want to do that. All right,
[452.78s -> 469.54s]  is this game good? How is it? This game good? Yeah. I've seen a few slimes and they're cute.
[469.54s -> 492.68s]  Okay, it's the same as one, but better. Okay, let's go. Tar? Oh, well, you can disable the
[492.68s -> 510.01s]  bad slimes. Huh. Okay, well, one time- how high can you go? One and a half times damage?
[510.57s -> 525.90s]  We're just- we're just playing the regular way. I'm not doing anything weird. Is there a cutscene?
[525.90s -> 532.46s]  After a long day of slime ranching, Beatrix Laboo was enjoying a cool glass of carrot juice as she
[532.46s -> 537.90s]  watched the sun set across the slime sea. Suddenly, a boat arrived at her dock with nothing
[537.90s -> 548.46s]  inside but a mysterious letter. You've explored the far, far range from the dusty shores of the
[548.46s -> 554.46s]  dry reef to the furthest reaches of the perilous glass desert. There are worlds yet uncharted,
[554.46s -> 559.50s]  Beatrix Laboo. Rainbow Island awaits you. Climb aboard if you're ready for a new adventure.
[564.63s -> 570.47s]  Beatrix excitedly boarded the boat and took it across the slime sea. Eventually, she saw an
[570.47s -> 574.95s]  island unlike anything on the far, far range. Mountains, trees, and grasses all in an array
[574.95s -> 583.94s]  of colors that danced and moved like a dream. As she explored, she found an abandoned conservatory
[583.94s -> 588.10s]  overlooking the rest of the island. Curiously, it was equipped with everything a slime rancher
[588.10s -> 597.70s]  like her would ever need to wrangle slime, start a farm, and build gadgets. That was- that scared
[597.70s -> 607.21s]  the shit out of me. And so, a new adventure begins. Beatrix tightened her boots, readied her
[607.21s -> 614.82s]  vac pack, and set out to explore Rainbow Island and uncover its mysteries. I don't know, it was a
[614.82s -> 632.73s]  loud screaming noise. How- it scared me a little. All right, sensitivity's way too high. Let's try
[632.73s -> 642.78s]  that. It feels a little bit better. All right, moving around. This game looks like the graphics
[642.78s -> 656.78s]  have increased a little. There's a lot of bloom. It looks pretty good. All right, vac pack. Yep,
[656.86s -> 665.77s]  suck in slimes. I remember this. Yeah, then you got to shoot them through the barrier, right?
[666.41s -> 671.00s]  So, is that- no, that's not it. That's not it. That's not- that's wrong.
[671.88s -> 688.26s]  Shoot through a cor- yeah, here we go. Then they sit here. They shit out money. Okay, so they eat
[688.26s -> 701.99s]  fruit, veggies, and meat, right? Cool. Okay, so then- oh, here's the marketplace, right? Just E.
[702.63s -> 709.16s]  Basic player controls. Okay, I think I got it. So, this game just kind of assumed that you finished
[709.16s -> 716.12s]  the first one and we're downloading the second one and it's like, let's go. What- let's go,
[716.12s -> 729.82s]  right? Like, that's it. Let's go. So, I need to feed them. What do I get the food? Don't you- don't
[729.82s -> 739.96s]  you plant berries and shit too? Is there a map? There is. Okay, so where am I? I think we're going
[739.96s -> 748.18s]  to get Elden Ringed. I think it looks like it, right? It kind of looks like it, doesn't it?
[749.94s -> 760.62s]  Put the cam in a different place. Okay. Oh yeah, chickens, right? Food like fruits,
[760.62s -> 772.60s]  veggies, or chickens. Hold on. I got it. I might be a weirdo, but does anybody else agree with me
[772.60s -> 778.78s]  that music in the background of a game? Just- I hate it. I just- I want it to be quiet and I'm a
[778.78s -> 786.47s]  weirdo. I've done this- um, I've tested this theory where if I turn the music off during, like,
[786.47s -> 794.63s]  Dark Souls or Elden Ring, I will play five times better at a boss. So, you know how the boss
[794.63s -> 805.03s]  musics are always like, if I turn that off, I will beat that boss fucking 100 times easier.
[808.39s -> 814.68s]  Okay, so I get to get food. All right, try shooting food at a pink slime. They'll eat anything.
[814.68s -> 820.04s]  They'll eat chickens? I thought they didn't- I thought they only ate berries.
[825.18s -> 831.88s]  Oh, how do I only pick up the money? When slimes eat, they make plorts. Head on over to the
[831.88s -> 842.34s]  plort market and cast your pillow. Okay, depends on the game. Yeah, I really do. I- you know what,
[842.34s -> 849.50s]  it's definitely like a concentration problem or like an ADHD problem, but if I turn all the sounds
[849.50s -> 861.03s]  off and I just do it visually, I will- I will first try every boss in Dark Souls. Here we go.
[861.03s -> 870.58s]  How much money do I got? 261. Get out there and explore. So, we're just going. All right, so now
[870.58s -> 876.84s]  I got- how much is it to do another pen? Happy slime makes for a happy- okay, this is two-
[877.94s -> 894.98s]  250. I have to produce food. I gotta do a garden, right? Prove it. Prove it. I don't have Dark Souls
[894.98s -> 907.80s]  ready to go. I'm doing a garden. Yeah, shoot a veggie or fruit into the depositor to begin
[907.80s -> 912.02s]  growing more of that type. Yeah, this is what I want because I gotta start- that was one thing,
[912.02s -> 921.46s]  was food was always a huge problem. Where's my wi-fi off? All right, let's go. I'm just gonna go
[921.46s -> 928.50s]  straight to the front door. Install it right now. I'm not- no, I'm not gonna install Dark Souls to
[928.50s -> 935.05s]  turn all the music off and beat champion Gundyr in one minute. It's- I don't- I don't- I'm not
[935.05s -> 961.59s]  gonna do that. Silent. Hold on. Just prepare it in a different window? That sounds like you want to
[961.59s -> 977.86s]  do it. Carrots. How many can fit in one pen? Pomegranates? Just do it. Just do it. I don't
[977.86s -> 981.38s]  have a save file that's at any boss. They would have to be the first boss of any of those games.
[981.38s -> 1005.16s]  Slimes. Well, that's a bunny. Yep. Fog fruit. Oh, shit. Large slimes are large,
[1005.16s -> 1012.70s]  formed when slimy support- I'm like- I forgot. Right. All right, I'm going back. I'm going back.
[1013.58s -> 1039.21s]  I'm going back. Okay, there's the garden. I'll do a big pen over here. Stay right there.
[1040.86s -> 1048.60s]  All right. Oh, it's like incinerator. Pond. Okay, right. So I want to do this. I only have 11 bucks.
[1048.60s -> 1056.14s]  Never mind. Will you just hang up over here if I feed you? All right, should I do fog fruit or-
[1056.14s -> 1065.11s]  I'm gonna do carrots. All right, yeah. Carrots. And then we'll feed you- Here you go, guys. Going in.
[1068.50s -> 1092.42s]  They eat anything, right? Let's make some fucking money. He's gonna eat somebody. How do I suck up
[1092.42s -> 1098.34s]  just the money? Oh, I need to build that, don't I? I think I have to actually build it.
[1098.34s -> 1119.16s]  Okay, this is growing, right? Yep. Floor vacuum for the pen. Yeah. So what are these worth?
[1119.72s -> 1130.07s]  1.11? That's not bad. Cool. All right. The market changes too, doesn't it? On a daily basis.
[1135.88s -> 1146.44s]  I need to make a cabinet, whatever. A chickadoo? Shit, I don't have money.
[1176.82s -> 1191.94s]  What do you like that? That's what a chickadee does. And apparently that's only cute to your
[1191.94s -> 1199.06s]  girlfriend. Apparently. Apparently doing that on the couch going like, it's only cute to your
[1199.06s -> 1225.80s]  girlfriend. Okay. Oh, he's gonna be sus today. Boy, it's nighttime. You have to sleep, don't you?
[1229.13s -> 1238.76s]  You're nearly 40. So I'm 40, so therefore I cannot ever for the rest of my life
[1238.76s -> 1249.72s]  imitate a chickadee for the rest of my entire life. No, I refuse. Hey, dude, what's that bird?
[1249.72s -> 1252.44s]  That birds have like a pretty interesting, you know, you know that call, that bird call.
[1253.67s -> 1256.70s]  No, I don't. I don't. I'm 40. Oh, but you know, it's like, it's like,
[1257.58s -> 1263.93s]  how do you do it? I've heard you do it before. No, no, I'm 40. I can't make that sound.
[1264.73s -> 1270.25s]  Yes, it's a fucking bird sound. You're fine. No, I can't. I'm 40. I can't make sounds.
[1271.21s -> 1278.02s]  I'm going to be, I don't care. I'm going to make sounds until I'm dead. You understand that when
[1278.02s -> 1284.12s]  I'm in my death bed and there was rotten. Oh, no, it's just nighttime. When I'm lying in my
[1284.12s -> 1287.56s]  death bed and I'm connected to like about, you know, what it's I'm like 90 or something, like
[1287.56s -> 1291.96s]  a hundred and everyone's like gathered around the bed and everyone's like, oh, let's just say
[1291.96s -> 1304.63s]  goodbye to grandpa. Right. You bet your ass that I'm going to be like, you bet your fucking ass.
[1304.63s -> 1314.04s]  That's the last thing I'm leaving you with. All right. I need to make it. I need more money.
[1318.74s -> 1331.29s]  Yeah. And what they don't know, it was me making that noise. I'm all right. I got at least another
[1331.29s -> 1345.64s]  few days. Come back tomorrow. Can't make sound effects anymore. What is it? All right. So I need
[1345.64s -> 1352.76s]  more money. I need, when, how long does it take to grow? Probably a little while, right? I'm just,
[1352.76s -> 1372.09s]  I'm just going to go sleep. Death bed stream. You know how fucked up that would really be though?
[1372.09s -> 1382.10s]  How are you getting out? Stop. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you.
[1384.15s -> 1392.06s]  Can you imagine if like, I, you know, I retire, whatever, and then you just don't really hear
[1392.06s -> 1402.30s]  from me at all. I fall into complete irrelevancy over the course of like 40 years. And then one day
[1403.42s -> 1412.31s]  you're a complete, you're completely grown up to, and you're like fifties or sixties or seventies
[1412.31s -> 1418.92s]  and you get a notification on whatever device you have. You're still following that. I went
[1418.92s -> 1425.56s]  live today and it's me lying there. It's like, I wanted to make sure I went out with everybody's
[1425.56s -> 1440.74s]  here on Twitch. I don't know where it would be. Would you guys be there if you were like 75? All
[1440.74s -> 1444.50s]  right. I'll get enough money to make those then. I don't know if you would. Okay. You'd probably
[1444.50s -> 1451.14s]  look at your phone or your, you know, holographic fucking eye cameras and just be like, nah, I don't
[1451.14s -> 1477.74s]  think so. Is that too much going on? Okay. 300 bucks. I need more food. That's, you're immoral.
[1477.74s -> 1484.14s]  I mean, I'm not actually going to stream the last moments of my life in a hospital. Like why would
[1484.14s -> 1505.00s]  I, that's, I'm not going to, when I'm like a hundred? No. Should I do a coop? I think so. Okay. I
[1505.00s -> 1515.58s]  need chickens in there. I think I have too many, right? There are too many. I need way more food.
[1515.58s -> 1541.38s]  I'll be back. Now you said immortal, not immoral. Yeah. I need way more food. Merch for your deathbed
[1541.38s -> 1580.78s]  stream. That's fucked up. All right. I need way more food. What is this? Is it oil? Get tombstone
[1580.78s -> 1597.66s]  shirts. Ooh. Okay. Can you mark anything on the map or you just have to kind of browse around?
[1597.66s -> 1603.21s]  I'm going a little too far. Discover map data nodes across the range to uncover more of your map.
[1612.71s -> 1621.08s]  These mushrooms. I need to upgrade. Honestly, I'm just trying to get as many carrots as I can.
[1622.20s -> 1636.10s]  And, um, get these too. You have to pay for the deathbed stream. Wait, there's a new, hold on.
[1638.78s -> 1650.57s]  Tabby slime. Oh, I remember these. Refinery. Refinery links conveniently transport resources
[1650.57s -> 1662.86s]  and ports to the, what did it say? I can send stuff from the world to the farm. That's pretty
[1662.86s -> 1686.46s]  cool. Okay. Okay. It tells you what they like. Favorite is chickens. It doesn't really have a
[1686.46s -> 1704.86s]  favorite. Favorite is blue ice cream or something, whatever it is. Water lettuce. Interesting. What
[1704.86s -> 1709.66s]  if they banned you right before you do? Yeah. Cause I would be dying on camera, right? Then
[1709.66s -> 1716.60s]  you're going to get the, not like this disconnect thing. Can you imagine they caught it right at
[1716.60s -> 1738.02s]  like, right at like the flat line. Okay. I gotta go back. Oh, can you mark stuff on the map?
[1741.32s -> 1751.32s]  Streams is going to lag. You drop a bunch of frames. We come back from a disconnect.
[1752.97s -> 1757.98s]  Community Jake like walks into the frame for a minute. Hey, hey, can you die again?
[1757.98s -> 1762.89s]  We, we, we lost a connection. I don't know what we lost. What do you see?
[1768.49s -> 1776.50s]  All right. I got 20 carrots. I'm ready. What's that? Ooh, that's the lettuce stuff. Don't touch
[1776.50s -> 1790.49s]  that. That's mine. Um, I want to grow that probably, right? Don't touch it. Water lettuce. I
[1790.49s -> 1808.23s]  want to grow this. This is somebody's favorite, right? Yeah. I got to grow this. Am I going the
[1808.23s -> 1813.99s]  right way? Yeah. This game's fun. This game is just like the other one. Okay. Here's the thing
[1813.99s -> 1820.02s]  about Slime Rancher. Starting over in Slime Rancher was always like, I don't think I really
[1820.02s -> 1823.22s]  want to do that. I think I've seen what the game is and I've seen everything I really want to do.
[1823.86s -> 1827.70s]  Would I have loved to have memory wiped myself and played Slime Rancher one again, because I
[1827.70s -> 1834.18s]  loved that initial kind of playing the port market and making money and making pens and stuff.
[1834.74s -> 1838.98s]  So this is, I just memory wiped and I'm playing Slime Rancher again. So this is great. I'm very,
[1838.98s -> 1850.17s]  I'm very happy. Hey, hey, sometimes people just want more and you just give them more.
[1850.73s -> 1860.12s]  What's wrong with that? I bet you this is probably some new tools and stuff. The map's probably a
[1860.12s -> 1872.66s]  lot bigger too. It feels like it. All right. Let's go. All right. I'm back. I've got a bunch of
[1872.66s -> 1892.46s]  carrots. Um, okay. Here you go. Well, don't jump out. You know what? You just, there's, there's too
[1892.46s -> 1914.33s]  many. So, but you should eat. I want you to eat something. All right. 20. Was it worth? I went
[1914.33s -> 1933.19s]  down. What the fuck? It was 11 bucks. Now it's 10. Okay. I can do another. I swear to God,
[1933.19s -> 1942.58s]  I thought this was Jerma in the casket. Okay. I think I've seen this before, but hold on.
[1943.38s -> 1955.02s]  Am I, does somebody edit me into this? This looks like I'm, am I edited into this picture?
[1955.02s -> 1982.92s]  I thought this was Jerma in the casket. I swear to God, I thought this was Jerma in the casket.
[1982.92s -> 2042.23s]  What is this? What movie is this from? No, don't vote. Hold on. It's so hard to do this.
[2082.73s -> 2119.70s]  All right. Get this off the fucking screen. I'm still alive, but this chin is way too big. Hold on.
[2119.70s -> 2124.42s]  Oh, I'm done. It's so, you know, it's like, it's, you know, how hard it is to make the adjustments
[2124.42s -> 2155.08s]  over here and be upside down. This is my soul. Look at, we're looking into each other's souls.
[2155.08s -> 2174.71s]  No, no, no. Wait, wait, hold on. Then I wake up. I have to go back into my body.
[2174.71s -> 2189.90s]  I'm the spirit flying in like, I'm in. And now it's me. I have to go back into my body.
[2189.90s -> 2213.70s]  How big was this webcam? Jerma ghost? That is like fucked up though. It actually does look
[2213.70s -> 2226.58s]  ridiculous. Make it mirrored. No, I'm supposed to like go fly down, right? You did this bit
[2226.58s -> 2233.58s]  three years ago. No, I didn't prove it. Hey, prove it. Don't you understand? Like,
[2234.54s -> 2239.50s]  it's a series of recycling a joke from five years ago over and over again.
[2239.50s -> 2252.20s]  You did? When? Oh, when I, I was going to say, when was I in a casket on stream doing like a
[2252.20s -> 2258.23s]  routine where I fly back into my body? It's like that never happened. Oh, okay. I know what you
[2258.23s -> 2262.71s]  mean. When I died on stream and I came out of the, okay. I remember. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[2263.27s -> 2267.58s]  I thought you meant that exact scenario right there. Okay. Yeah, I did do that. You're right.
[2268.30s -> 2280.68s]  All right. I want, I got to make, I could take some chickens over here. Let's do another garden
[2280.68s -> 2285.27s]  because I want to grow this water lettuce because it's the bunny's favorite, right?
[2289.08s -> 2303.58s]  When was that? 2018? 2017? Because then I'm going to put these guys over here. All right. I got to
[2303.58s -> 2316.98s]  get more food. There are definitely way too many, but whatever. This is before hit and run. Yeah,
[2316.98s -> 2327.08s]  I would think so. There we go. Come here. Nice. All right. I need to put these in the pen.
[2327.08s -> 2348.78s]  It was January, 2019. Oh, yeah. Close enough. All the viewers. This game is pretty. It is really
[2348.78s -> 2363.66s]  pretty. That's growing. I'll put the, who's is the favorite, right? Thumbnail, the thumbnail.
[2363.66s -> 2379.18s]  I don't get it. All right. I want to know. No, that's not what I want. I think I just have to,
[2379.18s -> 2383.88s]  I don't want to lose the whatever. I just got to get more food until I can grow up myself.
[2383.96s -> 2395.02s]  Let's go. Just more carrots, more fruits, more vegetables. I don't want to lose the cats though.
[2395.02s -> 2421.61s]  Suck in your cheeks, raise eyebrows and smile at the camera. I don't get it. Can I touch my elbow?
[2421.61s -> 2445.35s]  Who cares? All right. I'm just trying. I'm just getting food. That's all I want. I don't care
[2445.35s -> 2465.13s]  about ports right now. Just food. That's all I want. And I fold my tongue. No, I can do this.
[2467.16s -> 2480.60s]  I can't do anything. Oh no. Can you, somebody said, can you fold your tongue? And I said, no,
[2480.60s -> 2519.85s]  I don't think I thought I could. You can't. Does it work? Stop. What? He's left brain,
[2519.85s -> 2529.29s]  right brain Andy right now. What? Wouldn't that just mean a complete brain? Wouldn't that mean
[2529.29s -> 2538.17s]  that I go fine? Left brain, right brain Andy. What's it mean? You mean like one's taking control
[2538.17s -> 2555.51s]  for five seconds and the other one takes over for five seconds? Oh, they had a test in high school
[2555.51s -> 2560.63s]  saying stuff like you're left brained if you can roll your tongue and vice versa. It was dumb.
[2561.77s -> 2591.75s]  Oh, I see. All right. Let me get some money now. American education moment. I always forget which
[2591.75s -> 2602.49s]  one is which. What's left brain is the analytical kind of mathematics one, right? And then right
[2602.49s -> 2622.84s]  brain is the more artistic, whatever it is. Reverse that. Okay. It's crazy how we have all these
[2622.84s -> 2628.57s]  theories and is there, is there science to back that up? Is it like, oh yeah, by the way,
[2628.57s -> 2633.86s]  that is what it is. I wonder how much that gets refined in like another hundred years.
[2636.81s -> 2642.81s]  Like, is how we view the brain and kind of our bodies right now going to turn into how we view
[2642.81s -> 2650.97s]  people bleeding people because they had a cold? Like, oh yeah, you have the sniffles. Let's remove
[2650.97s -> 2655.93s]  half your blood. Do you think that eventually like in two, three, 400 years people are going
[2655.93s -> 2662.20s]  to look back and be like, what were they talking about? Wait, they thought they thought that they
[2662.20s -> 2668.12s]  had a left and right brain. I bet it's going to be, it's weird thinking about that. Just like,
[2668.12s -> 2673.46s]  what is going to be completely outdated science and education wise in a hundred years? Because
[2673.46s -> 2683.82s]  we are going to be that group that looks back and goes, holy shit. Yeah. Fuck in like 50 plus years.
[2683.82s -> 2698.41s]  It's possible. No, maybe not in our lifetime. Maybe like another two lifetimes. We, you're the
[2698.41s -> 2719.14s]  one that's 40 dude. That okay. I'm not that old. All right. I got 320. What's okay. It's time to
[2719.14s -> 2724.87s]  make a pen and time to feed bunnies their favorite foods, which is water lettuce. Let's do it. This
[2724.87s -> 2745.22s]  is where the money starts to actually roll here. Pretty, pretty, pretty big. Here you go. Look at
[2745.22s -> 2776.30s]  they love it. You're 20 years older than me. Dang. All right. These are, these are worth like 20 or
[2776.30s -> 2809.98s]  30, aren't they? You guys happy? Good. Remember you're as old as my step mom. Wait, these are
[2809.98s -> 2827.42s]  a good value. Yep. Seven. Oh hell yeah. Hell yeah. I said almost as old. Yeah. But, but how,
[2827.42s -> 2856.42s]  what do you mean? Oh, are we talking like 45? Cause that's, I'm not even close. All right. So now
[2856.42s -> 2871.13s]  I think it's time to go to sleep. How do I upgrade this stuff? Okay. Here we go. Nutrient soil
[2871.13s -> 2874.89s]  contains compost from the rainbow fields and minerals from Ember Valley makes crop always
[2874.89s -> 2883.90s]  yield the maximum harvest grow twice as fast. I want that. So we're going to save up for it.
[2883.90s -> 2898.97s]  I guess they will eat anything, right? So then, so now from my understanding, if I feed a, you,
[2898.97s -> 2906.25s]  you feed a plot of a different slime to a different slime and it becomes something else. Right. So I
[2906.25s -> 2911.74s]  take this and then I feed this to one of them over here. Right. That's what, if I remember,
[2912.76s -> 2918.18s]  except that they, what are they doing? They're trying to escape. Okay. Well, whatever. Well,
[2918.18s -> 2923.19s]  I'm not going to do that yet. I don't think I'm prepared for that yet. So I'm going to go to bed.
[2925.75s -> 2930.15s]  This game, I love this game. It's just as fun as the other one. It's just more of that,
[2930.15s -> 2957.30s]  but it's somehow new. Let's go. How's the audio? Audio good? Is the sound high enough? Low enough?
[2957.30s -> 2963.40s]  Nobody wants meat yet. So that's fine. All right. I'm going to go out and do another,
[2964.73s -> 2976.26s]  another poll. I'm just going to go out and just do another poll. You're not 40. You got plenty of
[2976.26s -> 2984.95s]  time. I know. I look, I don't care how if I'm 40. You think, are you serious? You don't think I'm
[2984.95s -> 2990.12s]  still going to, you don't think I'm still going to pull my pajama pants all the way up to below my
[2990.12s -> 2996.74s]  breasts, my leg area, my chest, whatever. And with super Mario pajama pants on and like put my hands
[2996.74s -> 3004.42s]  down and walk around. Like, I just have legs in the house. You think I'm going to stop doing that?
[3004.42s -> 3011.32s]  My, they're like chest muscle. What am I, my breasts, my breast or area, whatever this is,
[3011.32s -> 3022.63s]  my sternum. What is it? What is this called? My under my chests. My, what? I didn't even want
[3022.63s -> 3032.34s]  to kill that thing and I just did accidentally. Pectoral muscles. Thank you. No, torso is down
[3032.34s -> 3043.16s]  here. This is chest muscles. All right. Chest, whatever. Pectorals. But anyways, my point was,
[3045.93s -> 3067.56s]  I'm not going to just stop doing that, which I haven't gone over there this way. What about
[3067.56s -> 3086.01s]  down here? I don't think I've gone over here. Mushrooms? Me when the, oh, you didn't finish it.
[3086.01s -> 3099.29s]  What's this? Ah, all right. Hydro turret blueprint. That sounds pretty, um, pretty sick.
[3104.86s -> 3115.34s]  What was that? What just happened? That was weird. It was like a little rock that had stuff in it.
[3115.34s -> 3151.96s]  Nothing. Me when the, whatever. I wasted it. Yeah. Maybe more food. I mean, I'll just take these.
[3151.96s -> 3155.37s]  Why not? It's free money. Look at this. Look at all this.
[3157.13s -> 3170.71s]  Have you seen this? You can see this, right? What do they call it? Oven when you, hold on. Why do
[3170.71s -> 3181.78s]  they call it oven when you in of out the cold food and in out hot eat the food? I don't know.
[3181.78s -> 3199.53s]  I don't know what that means. They did it wrong. Why do they call it oven when you of in the cold
[3199.53s -> 3209.61s]  food of out eat? I feel like my head hurts. What is this from Garfield? Why do they call it oven
[3209.61s -> 3237.83s]  when you of in like put in cold food? It's an edit. Okay. Hmm. I need more food. Oh, I need,
[3237.83s -> 3248.97s]  okay. Yeah, this is, okay. You know, I'm, this is, I, no, I'm not going to say it, but like, man,
[3248.97s -> 3254.42s]  this is, this is the, this is my kind of game. This is my kind of game, especially, you know,
[3254.42s -> 3265.03s]  if I was sitting on the couch. Oh, this would be a great couch game. Just sitting on the couch.
[3265.99s -> 3292.36s]  Oh yeah. I think I'm all right now. I got 20. This puts me over the edge. Now I can do the
[3292.36s -> 3301.83s]  faster growing. Yeah, it was, it was made up. Okay. Look up Garfield, but minus Garfield.
[3305.72s -> 3317.61s]  I have way better things to do with my time than that bullshit. Okay. Like beating carrots to slimes.
[3318.25s -> 3351.10s]  The original comic is a fun comic. It makes John look crazy. I've actually seen it before and it's
[3351.10s -> 3366.44s]  very funny. Wait, didn't somebody do like Garfield, but as like a Lovecraftian monster? There was a
[3366.44s -> 3383.75s]  lot of Garfield material. It's all, it's all very funny. It's John just saying stuff to his pet cat.
[3393.29s -> 3402.82s]  You know, uh, but isn't that kind of already fucking happening? Isn't John just kind of
[3402.82s -> 3408.10s]  talking to his cat? Is it even confirmed that Garfield can even really actually talk? Right?
[3408.10s -> 3417.22s]  Like that's already happening. Like John is just talking to nothing. That's already a thing. What's
[3417.22s -> 3440.44s]  wrong with them all? Something wrong? Veggie diet. This is not a vegetable. Oh shit. Okay.
[3441.00s -> 3457.13s]  It's a fruit. You're right. Does anybody have their favorite example of the Garfield-less John comic?
[3457.13s -> 3479.19s]  One of the mods want to link me one? You guys want this. I'm just going to let them go. This is way
[3479.19s -> 3514.84s]  too many. Let me see this one. Oh my God. Stop moving other stuff. Why is this locked? Remember
[3514.84s -> 3535.70s]  the time yesterday when I almost ate a donut? These are fucking funny. Hold on. This one too.
[3539.83s -> 3564.41s]  Something wrong with my pants. I do this shit like every day. I like this one. Stop making toast.
[3564.41s -> 3578.31s]  But is he making the toast? What is happening in this one? What is happening in this one?
[3587.03s -> 3613.51s]  Yeah. This one's sad. This one's really sad. Oh my God. This is so awful. I'm going to throw
[3613.51s -> 3622.38s]  myself a surprise party. Gosh. I hope I don't suspect anything. Oh man. This is just fucked
[3622.38s -> 3636.62s]  up. He looks so happy in the second picture. I don't know. Poor John. Now those are fucking
[3636.62s -> 3650.49s]  wild. What? Oh, some of these are so bad. Some of these are bad. I don't. Oh, I don't like it.
[3656.98s -> 3685.53s]  Okay. Last one and then we're done. Yeah. Those are, those are, those are fucking classic. All
[3685.53s -> 3698.17s]  right. Let's go. You have some plorts and new bucks to spare. I don't get it. What do you mean
[3698.17s -> 3704.15s]  you don't get it? He's, Garfield's supposed to be on the chair. So they edited Garfield out of the
[3704.15s -> 3710.07s]  chair and Garfield's too lazy to get out of the chair. So he just drags the chair with Garfield
[3710.07s -> 3715.77s]  in it to the vet. But you see that he's been removed. So he's just dragging a chair to the vet
[3715.77s -> 3724.02s]  and looks, um, a little, a little weird. So you get it, right? All right. I got a lot of money.
[3724.02s -> 3732.60s]  I got to go to the lab underneath the conservatory. All right. Where is that?
[3732.60s -> 3751.26s]  I have to go in the conservatory. How do I get down there? Oh, feed them, feed them. I was too
[3751.26s -> 3757.62s]  busy looking at funny Garfield list comics. I'm sorry. This is what I'm talking about.
[3768.50s -> 3784.34s]  What does this do? I don't want this yet. Oh, right. You have to, you can make shit. All right. Um,
[3784.34s -> 3798.57s]  I need resources. Okay. When are you going to do Garfield shorts movie night? Um, I don't know if
[3798.57s -> 3803.21s]  what conspiracy you want to believe or what you want to look into or what, what it is about
[3803.21s -> 3812.47s]  Garfield, but Garfield has stayed around. He is the test of time has shown that Garfield is now a
[3813.27s -> 3818.87s]  super meme and people think Garfield's really funny and shit. Even, even unironically, right? Or
[3818.87s -> 3826.33s]  ironically Garfield, there was the meme stuff that came over the last 10 years or so. And I don't
[3826.33s -> 3832.01s]  think any other old comic strip like that has really stuck around in the mainstream kind of
[3832.01s -> 3842.89s]  meme world like Garfield has. I'm trying to think if there's other ones, not really Dilbert. I don't
[3842.89s -> 3856.34s]  know about Dilbert. I don't think so. The peanuts. Yeah. But the peanuts, kind of the peanuts are
[3856.34s -> 3862.28s]  sort of, they have that new show, right? On whatever it is like, like Apple TV or something.
[3862.28s -> 3875.69s]  But, but Garfield took on this next level kind of ironic humor. The peanuts don't have that.
[3878.81s -> 3883.70s]  Garfield's kind of turned into Shrek in a way. If either that, that comparison makes sense
[3886.14s -> 3890.79s]  or like Peter Griffin, like Garfield turned into like Peter Griffin with people just kind of
[3890.79s -> 3911.24s]  put them everywhere. If just as a funny joke. All right. I got to spend some money. Shrek is Shrek.
[3913.22s -> 3918.28s]  Yeah, no, I mean, of course. I mean, Shrek is in the Library of Congress. This is one of the most
[3918.28s -> 3922.60s]  important films ever made. But they've, okay, they're very hungry. All right. I got it. I got it.
[3922.60s -> 3926.52s]  Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh my God. What have I done? What's happening?
[3927.32s -> 3940.47s]  Oh my God. I'm sorry. How do I, what do I do? Hold on. Everybody hold on. Relax. Relax. Relax.
[3940.47s -> 3950.55s]  Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. If I sneeze, then I, if I sneeze,
[3950.55s -> 3955.27s]  then I'm going to come into 500 million dollars with no strings attached at some point in the
[3955.27s -> 3981.54s]  very near future. Okay. Not going to happen. All right. Eat, eat, eat, eat. It's in there. Come on.
[3982.58s -> 3992.66s]  All right. There we go. I was making, what do you mean? I was making a joke that if I sneezed right
[3992.66s -> 3996.18s]  there, like I thought I was going to, because it was coming, that I'm going to, if I sneeze,
[3996.18s -> 4023.35s]  I get a million dollars, right? The non sequitur. Irma hallucinates and thinks he owns a dog. Wait,
[4023.35s -> 4051.51s]  this is pretty much what you just were looking at. I'm going to leave him here. Come on. Turn this
[4051.51s -> 4078.25s]  down. Have I ever seen this video? Is this going to be like a Toy Story scenario where like I leave
[4078.25s -> 4082.57s]  the room. He doesn't know that this is recording. He gets up and starts walking on fucking two legs.
[4082.57s -> 4086.57s]  I'm not the dog. This is not like dog. I'm not the dog. If you just got in here, like a minute ago,
[4087.74s -> 4093.67s]  listen, the microphone's down here right now. Listen to me. I haven't washed my hair in two days.
[4094.63s -> 4100.95s]  I've conditioned it twice. I'd haven't done that because after VR, my hair gets wicked
[4100.95s -> 4105.27s]  fucked up and I'm afraid to wash it because I'm afraid it'll fall out. Why is, why are you,
[4105.27s -> 4109.69s]  why are you saying this? I'm going to do it today. Why are you saying this?
[4110.41s -> 4116.81s]  All right. So you're probably asking why am I doing this? No, I, yes, I am. I am asking that,
[4116.81s -> 4121.80s]  Jeremy. I fucked up the sus and the sus said there was a scream today for the last two days
[4122.86s -> 4130.55s]  and I didn't even know there was a scream that was scheduled for today until like a half an hour ago,
[4130.55s -> 4135.67s]  40 minutes ago. Oh, come on. What's this? Get up there like that. There you go. Now you look better.
[4136.63s -> 4139.03s]  I didn't know there was going to be a stream today, but now apparently there is.
[4140.79s -> 4146.55s]  I told you guys that anybody that was in the fake pre-stream chat that we were going to do an auto
[4146.55s -> 4154.07s]  stream. It really is John Artbuckle. This is literally going to be like 30 minutes. I'm just
[4154.07s -> 4158.79s]  doing this because I got guilt tripped by pre-stream because I, you know, this is a guilt trip stream.
[4158.79s -> 4168.06s]  Got me. Come right, go there exactly. Oh, here comes a full body reveal of the dog. Oh, no,
[4168.06s -> 4175.82s]  nevermind. Well, I know what it'll make me get up. It'll move for his favorite toy. Just you wait.
[4177.42s -> 4183.98s]  Flamingo. See? Oh dude, auto reveal. I didn't get the fuck out of the way.
[4184.78s -> 4191.91s]  What if he's just like shit on the carpet right now? Hey, don't do anything. Get daddy in trouble.
[4193.43s -> 4200.38s]  Just like spins around and just like dumps right here. Do you see the finger? Look at the finger.
[4200.38s -> 4204.70s]  Look at the finger. Oh, hey, hey, don't do anything. Look at this weird edited shit.
[4205.34s -> 4218.49s]  Just like spins around and just like dumps. Is that a fake hand? It's going to be like a
[4218.49s -> 4222.89s]  Toy Story scenario where like I leave the room. He doesn't know that this is recording. He gets
[4222.89s -> 4228.01s]  up and starts walking on fucking two legs. Oh, no, I gotta get the dog. I'm blocking the view of the
[4228.01s -> 4235.88s]  dog. Hey, did that just join the stream? Welcome. Have we seen this? Today's a subscriber. Uh,
[4235.88s -> 4243.54s]  what day is it? Tuesday. Welcome to subscriber Wednesday. He's going to get me. He's going to
[4243.54s -> 4258.46s]  get me. I'm not the dog. This is not like dog. I'm not the dog. If you just got in here like a minute
[4258.46s -> 4269.93s]  ago. I'm just putting this in my mouth. It's not rolling around. I know. I can't seem to move.
[4270.57s -> 4282.79s]  Oh, no, please. You have to rescue me. Oh, I can't get up. Oh, no, I can't. I can't seem.
[4283.90s -> 4291.90s]  I'm trying to do it. I, this is so sad. No, it's not sad when it was the John Arbuckle ones were sad.
[4291.90s -> 4312.31s]  This is a human, normal human behavior. Those of you that are wanting to eat that may have come out
[4312.31s -> 4325.27s]  of my mouth. That's enough of that. That's enough of that. That's enough of that. Completely normal
[4325.27s -> 4336.95s]  behavior. All right. All right. Okay. All right. What is that? So sad. It's not sad. It's a funny
[4337.83s -> 4363.03s]  joke. Oh my God. Look at all this cash. I can't pick up more than one slot. Really? Why not?
[4363.03s -> 4394.36s]  Prices are going down, but I need the money. Okay. Everybody good. Everybody has been fed.
[4394.36s -> 4400.25s]  Everybody's good. Head back over here. I'll go bring you guys some carrots.
[4407.18s -> 4423.70s]  What is happening with these two? Why are they fused together? Is that, is this a new feature?
[4423.70s -> 4449.00s]  Can they like fuse together? That's interesting. Okay. I need. All right. I got another nod. All
[4449.00s -> 4462.76s]  right. I'm going to come here. Okay. No, they weren't fused together. I'm going to get rid of
[4462.76s -> 4475.86s]  a couple because I don't, I'm running out of the ability to feed everybody. So I'm going to combine
[4476.74s -> 4481.86s]  because I don't want the pink, the pink florts anymore. We're going to do some combinations
[4481.86s -> 4496.42s]  here. I'm going to do, uh, there. Okay. That's too many. Just go, go be free over there somewhere.
[4499.08s -> 4518.09s]  Who wants carrots? Uh, all right. Cool. You can upgrade the, uh, yeah.
[4520.34s -> 4533.10s]  Yeah. I know. I don't know how they, that's how, okay. We're going to do one more poll and then
[4533.10s -> 4544.95s]  I'm going to buy a bunch of upgrades. All right. That's the last poll. Do the chickens have to eat?
[4544.95s -> 4553.99s]  I forget, or they just kind of exist, right? Do you have to feed the chickens? No, no. Okay.
[4553.99s -> 4562.79s]  All right. I'm going to upgrade this pen so they, okay, they can't bounce out. That's a good thing
[4562.79s -> 4575.34s]  to have, especially because it could be the bigger ones are going to be here. That one's pretty good.
[4575.34s -> 4585.90s]  That one's huge. Yeah. I want this one too. And then the auto feeder is, uh,
[4585.90s -> 4602.82s]  will be coming after that. All right. Everybody in. I'm going to make them, I'm going to feed them
[4602.82s -> 4621.29s]  these, right? And we'll make a bunch of big ones. That sounds like a good idea. What's this? Oh,
[4622.58s -> 4628.66s]  hello. Hello. I'm sorry. Beatrix, do you read me? Testing, testing. Hmm. Perhaps you're lost at sea
[4628.66s -> 4633.59s]  taken away. Oops. Nope. Just forgot to turn on the display. Nice to see your face again, Beatrix.
[4633.59s -> 4638.79s]  I've missed you greatly, my dear friend. And while I'm quite excited for you to partake in
[4638.79s -> 4643.85s]  a new adventure, I already have data that might complicate things. Last night I received a message
[4643.85s -> 4649.77s]  from some sort of artificial intelligence program written in code, but not one I recognize. I'm in
[4649.77s -> 4655.75s]  the process of analyzing it, but I'm certain this message was sent from where you are now. Okay.
[4655.75s -> 4663.64s]  Mysterious boat takes you to a mysterious island and is a mysterious code from a mysterious island.
[4663.64s -> 4672.58s]  Curious. Well, thanks for literally zero info. Take this home portal. It should make the early
[4672.58s -> 4688.81s]  stages of your journey easier. That's good. And teleport back the town portal. Okay. It's time to
[4688.81s -> 4708.14s]  make big pink bunnies. Will they still like the lettuce that I'm making? I wonder. Hello. Well,
[4708.14s -> 4717.16s]  there we go. Nice. They will. Okay. So I need some, I'm going to go to bed when I wake up. The food
[4717.16s -> 4727.80s]  will probably be ready. I'm so goddamn excited. Do bunnies and cats actually probably better. I
[4727.80s -> 4743.02s]  do. I need a place to put them though. I guess what do they eat? Could I put them in the same pen
[4743.02s -> 4764.50s]  or are they going to, is there going to be a problem? Are they eating each other? They eat.
[4764.50s -> 4804.79s]  Okay. Happy slimes eat meat. All right. Here we go. It's going to start to get crazy in here.
[4804.79s -> 4834.09s]  Oh, and lettuce is ready. Okay. They, I caught in Tappy Largo. All right. Veggies. They're going to
[4834.09s -> 4846.84s]  get out. I need to buy that thing. Oh no. That's bad. How do I, are there too many? Oh shit. Okay.
[4846.84s -> 4877.37s]  Hold on. Air net. I need some money. I got to get the air net. Is this game worth it? 100%. Yes.
[4877.37s -> 4888.46s]  If you actually, honestly, if you've never played it, how much content is in the early access?
[4888.46s -> 4895.99s]  425. A lot. Okay. Is it, is it almost feature complete? Would you say it's at least 15 hours?
[4895.99s -> 4908.89s]  All right. Well then yeah, then it 100% is worth it. I know I'm, I know I'm coming with some,
[4908.89s -> 4920.09s]  some food. I need more chickens. All right. I'm going to go on a chicken run. Elder rooster. Okay.
[4920.09s -> 4940.71s]  Well, okay. Tappy port. What are these worth? All right. Where's the thing that collects the ports?
[4941.19s -> 4958.74s]  There it is. Okay. All right. Cool. Let's go. 28. That's worth a lot. All right. Let me get a
[4958.74s -> 4973.35s]  roof on this. I think there's too many. Are there too many? Are there too many in here? I think so.
[4973.35s -> 4992.28s]  Yeah. All right. I need to go and do some exploring. Oh, the carrot's not done. I need to go explore.
[4992.28s -> 5009.77s]  I've got to get some stuff. I'm going on a generic food run. I'm going to head here and then to the
[5009.77s -> 5049.08s]  left. Food run. Has he done the beat box thing yet? I think so. Yeah. Chickens, fruits, vegetables,
[5049.08s -> 5068.81s]  everything. Anything I can get. Okay. Yep. Is this thing? I want 20 of each. I got to get ahead of,
[5068.81s -> 5097.13s]  uh, ahead of myself here. Otherwise I'm going to be in a lot of trouble. Just am. Pod decoration.
[5097.13s -> 5107.83s]  Oh, I'm in this area now. All right. Where's one of those map pods? I have a question. So
[5110.15s -> 5119.27s]  I get a very important question. I keep getting on my YouTube homepage. Just I open up YouTube
[5119.27s -> 5132.78s]  and there it is. Gatorade pod videos. What is this? What is a Gatorade pod? You should watch it.
[5132.78s -> 5142.22s]  It's Gatorade. These little globes that people like into this container. It's not a Gatorade.
[5142.30s -> 5155.98s]  It's like a Gatorade syrup that you put into a, I guess, a travel kind of sip thing. I'm trying
[5155.98s -> 5164.92s]  to figure out what, what the application for that is. It's a make your own Gatorade. Right. But
[5165.80s -> 5174.94s]  why not just buy a Gatorade? Is it cheaper? What is, what's, what is it? Oh, I have like the red
[5174.94s -> 5181.58s]  Gatorade syrup that I turn it upside down and like into this special device that has to puncture the
[5181.58s -> 5198.10s]  thing. Why not just buy a red Gatorade? It's less plastic. No, it is expensive. It is. Wait, those
[5198.10s -> 5217.72s]  are good. It's a reusable bottle and you can dilute it. Maybe less plastic. One bottle in small pods.
[5217.72s -> 5225.53s]  Wouldn't like powder with like a paper kind of bad, like, you know, a paper container be better
[5225.53s -> 5233.22s]  than a plastic pod. But it just, it wouldn't be, powder would be bad or something. I mean, it's
[5233.22s -> 5239.54s]  still, I just keep seeing these videos and I'm just like, what, what is it? This is Gatorade pods?
[5244.78s -> 5251.21s]  That word. So just Kool-Aid. I mean, yeah, but just wait, does Kool-Aid have electrolytes
[5251.21s -> 5260.66s]  or is it just like food coloring and sugar? I don't think, I don't think Kool-Aid is a Gatorade.
[5263.06s -> 5275.08s]  It's, it's like yummy, delicious flavoring and sugar and food coloring. It's what less waste
[5275.08s -> 5282.06s]  overall because it's a reusable bottle. All right. I get it. Okay. So it's a, it's a, maybe it's a way
[5282.06s -> 5287.80s]  for Gatorade to be like, Hey, look, we have all these plastic bottles and we're going to shrink
[5287.80s -> 5296.39s]  our bottles to like 10% the size and you have to turn it upside down and like, like load it.
[5297.27s -> 5302.62s]  It's, it's almost like a little, it's a little canister. It's weird. This thing eats fruit.
[5302.62s -> 5321.24s]  Oh, no, I'll come back here versus right here. There was a specific reason why I came out here
[5321.24s -> 5329.94s]  and it was to collect 20 of each food and I'm going to stick to it. All right. I'm pretty close.
[5329.94s -> 5340.10s]  I just need some more. I got enough chickens. That's fine. The reason he's getting it on
[5340.10s -> 5350.81s]  YouTube is there's a big marketing push for it. Should I try it? Do you want to do like a Gatorade
[5350.81s -> 5386.44s]  pod stream review? No. All right. I brought food. Oh yeah. This is going to be huge now.
[5386.44s -> 5392.84s]  Look at how much money I'm about to make. They seem to want you just to do Kool-Aid instead.
[5394.94s -> 5399.03s]  What was the, what was the tier list that I want to do when I'm just sitting there? IRL.
[5399.91s -> 5410.78s]  Oh, cheese. I want to do a cheese tier list because of all the goat cheese bullshit.
[5410.78s -> 5425.98s]  All right. Can I get in there? Yeah. I want to do a cheese tier list. I talked about this with
[5425.98s -> 5430.62s]  Holly. She was like, you're going to like shit your pants. I was like, no, no, no. It's going to be
[5430.62s -> 5446.30s]  cubes, little cubes of each one. All right. This will put me in. It's going to be a lot of money
[5446.30s -> 5455.45s]  here. This is going to be a big payday. I can upgrade this pen. This pen kind of sucks.
[5456.73s -> 5464.65s]  I surely you probably won't shit your pants. I mean, if I do it correct, I mean, I was okay
[5464.65s -> 5472.55s]  on the last one. I will say I felt a little odd after eating all that random shit. You need at
[5472.63s -> 5478.17s]  least two to three variants of goat cheese to get a real, I, I promise I will get real goat cheese.
[5478.17s -> 5483.88s]  I will get the good stuff. I had a big argument with the mods by the way. There was, there was a,
[5483.88s -> 5491.00s]  there was a blowout in the mod chat on the discord. I was told that my opinions were
[5491.00s -> 5495.80s]  absolutely fucking meaningless. That they were disgusted that I said that goat cheese tasted
[5495.80s -> 5503.53s]  like dirt and it was, it was a blowout. So I was told this specific goat cheese you need to eat.
[5503.53s -> 5507.21s]  Don't just eat the random shit from like the random restaurant that puts it on top.
[5508.47s -> 5514.84s]  So I agreed. I said, okay, I will eat a specific good one and we'll see how I feel.
[5517.21s -> 5528.46s]  And it's got to be a blind taste test. Okay. Okay. That's fine. I'm going to know when it's
[5528.46s -> 5535.18s]  goat cheese because I'm going to want to puke when I eat it. This is not a Coke versus Pepsi
[5535.18s -> 5545.86s]  scenario. This is a Coke versus, this is a Coke versus a can of creamed corn that I have to drink.
[5545.86s -> 5560.68s]  I'm going to tell what's wrong with creamed corn. It's just so different. And I'm so
[5578.22s -> 5580.94s]  get out of here. Get out of here. You're not supposed to be over here.
[5581.98s -> 5597.93s]  You know, I actually don't, when was the last time I had creamed corn for all the people in the chat
[5597.93s -> 5602.57s]  that are calling me, yeah, what the fuck do you, you, you creamed corn, your elitist creamed corn.
[5603.59s -> 5607.51s]  I mean, when was the last time you ate creamed corn? I don't think you even could tell me.
[5610.07s -> 5624.23s]  I couldn't. I don't. When was the last time you ate a can of creamed corn? Today. Was it good?
[5627.06s -> 5636.79s]  Never in my whole life. LMAO. Never in my life. I feel like I've had it. Okay. It's not bad. It's
[5636.79s -> 5649.22s]  just kind of, it's a little off-putting. Cream corn is good. I don't remember the last time I
[5649.22s -> 5654.70s]  even had it. Had it been mixed in with something else, like a casserole or something, like a
[5654.70s -> 5661.85s]  Thanksgiving casserole. I don't know. One of your subs is named creamed corn. You better be nice.
[5662.49s -> 5667.67s]  I didn't say that it was bad. I just said I didn't, but I said it was kind of gross, but it is.
[5670.54s -> 5698.10s]  It tastes fine. Oh, that's good. We definitely want to make this better. Music box. Cream corn tier
[5698.10s -> 5703.40s]  list. Everyone is pinging me. Omega lul. You put creamed corn in F tier during the Thanksgiving
[5703.40s -> 5726.73s]  tier list last stream. I did? Um, I should probably get this, right? Yeah. That's a 46
[5726.73s -> 5746.90s]  month sub and that's the treatment you're giving a 46 month sub. Um, all right. Money's going to
[5746.90s -> 5757.91s]  start flowing here. You guys are all right. I think I need to take care of you. Oh, you know,
[5757.91s -> 5770.54s]  they've been fed. They've been fed. You should apologize. I mean, I'm no, no, I'm not going to.
[5770.54s -> 5781.70s]  I don't like creamed corn. I would not eat it from a can. I would not eat it with a fan. I would
[5781.70s -> 5788.36s]  not eat it in your house. I wouldn't even eat it with a mouse. I wouldn't eat it here or there.
[5788.92s -> 5807.59s]  I wouldn't eat it with a bear. I can't rhyme any other words. I don't know. Pretend like I did,
[5807.59s -> 5824.79s]  well, like a little bit more and then I eat it and I'm like, Oh, you wouldn't eat with a mouse.
[5826.66s -> 5838.74s]  Okay. I need more of, I think I need to separate some of these out because they're, they're,
[5838.74s -> 5849.72s]  they're doing another pen. I'll get one ready. I would not eat it on a bus. As you know,
[5849.72s -> 5855.75s]  that would make me sus. Yeah. But you had time to come up with that. You had time to sit there and
[5855.75s -> 5880.33s]  go. I didn't have that opportunity. Let's get some of the nighttime ones. Maybe I should go to sleep.
[5880.33s -> 5889.78s]  All right. I'm going to go to sleep. Mods are saying that they're a good chatter.
[5893.35s -> 5903.61s]  I don't know. All right. This is really funny to me, but they're a good chatter. They've only
[5903.61s -> 5911.67s]  been timed out. Now think about this, right? Just think about this. The mod is telling me,
[5911.67s -> 5915.27s]  no, they're a good chatter. They're good. They didn't, they're no problems. They didn't have
[5915.27s -> 5925.48s]  anything fucked up or okay. Whatever. They've only been timed out 91 times. That seems,
[5925.48s -> 5935.34s]  that seems like kind of a lot. That just goes to show you how much you guys misbehave here.
[5938.52s -> 5948.41s]  Look at how much you guys misbehave. Most frequent chatters have over a thousand timeouts,
[5950.94s -> 5961.24s]  over 999 plus timeouts for a, for a, a frequent chatter here. That is actually an incredible
[5961.24s -> 5970.34s]  ratio. Wow. I'm sitting here thinking, Oh, if you get, if I got time, maybe if you got time
[5970.42s -> 5984.15s]  out like twice. No, a thousand. Some of you guys have been timed out over a thousand times.
[5984.15s -> 6000.74s]  I'm sorry. It's nightbot. Fuck the caps limit. Well, dude, if you get timed out for caps
[6001.46s -> 6009.06s]  500 times, you're going to get timed out of 501st time for a thousand times is a lot.
[6009.06s -> 6012.50s]  If I got timed out a thousand times in a chat room, I'd probably be like,
[6013.46s -> 6024.42s]  I'm probably going to get fucking banned. One of my mods has been timed out 999 plus times.
[6024.42s -> 6032.89s]  Wait, what? No, you, Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. No, let's air it out. Let's air it out.
[6033.45s -> 6040.06s]  We've got 18 timeouts from one of the mods. Do you want me to tell you who these are?
[6040.06s -> 6054.28s]  Should I tell you who these are? Are you guys comfortable with that? Okay. Ooh. Oh,
[6054.28s -> 6068.25s]  VR Josh. VR Josh has been timed out 34 times. Dude, one was a personal one from you.
[6070.18s -> 6080.07s]  Wait, I timed you out personally. I'm interested. All right. Grump, what's yours?
[6080.07s -> 6094.38s]  How many times you've been timed out? Oh, wow. We currently have a leader.
[6094.38s -> 6103.30s]  We currently have a leader right now. Who's number one in regards to the timeouts here.
[6103.30s -> 6121.69s]  Okay. Kumakisu has three, three timeouts. Grump has never been timed out ever. Once. Ever. Ever.
[6121.69s -> 6142.58s]  In like seven years. Wow. That's actually remarkable. Wow. Not once. Unable to be timed
[6142.58s -> 6152.87s]  out. Immune. Not fair. You can't be timed out. Giga chat. Zero. No, wouldn't the Giga
[6152.87s -> 6159.29s]  chat be the person that's on my mod team that has like 900 timeouts, right? I feel like that
[6159.29s -> 6163.45s]  that's Giga chat, right? Like, I don't give a shit. I've been timed out a thousand times.
[6163.45s -> 6171.62s]  So that means, yeah, that means that, uh, I'm very curious about this. This is funny.
[6171.62s -> 6176.58s]  Is there a way? No, I don't want to do this, but this is kind of funny internally. Maybe
[6176.58s -> 6181.02s]  is there a way for the mods to know who in chat right now has the most timeouts ever
[6181.02s -> 6187.30s]  that's here right now? Cause like, I think that's funny. Who is, who is the ultimate
[6187.30s -> 6202.44s]  timeout Andy? Do we know? We can't see more than 999. There's internal stats on Twitch. Probably.
[6202.44s -> 6223.27s]  Oh, we can't see it. We can only see 999. Ollie's been timed out 11 times, but, but a thousand.
[6224.28s -> 6231.14s]  Those of you thousand plus Giga chats, you know what I'm saying? You've been timed out in this
[6231.14s -> 6260.39s]  channel over 999 fucking times. Oh, here we go. This is, that's so funny. Don't, uh, don't the
[6260.39s -> 6267.96s]  glowing slimes need to be somewhere else? The only need to be kind of in the underground or something
[6268.60s -> 6278.26s]  so they're not in the sunlight. That's how it worked in the first game. Almost all of it is
[6278.26s -> 6288.17s]  nightbot. I mean, I would imagine it would be. They have solar shields for, okay. Good to know.
[6288.17s -> 6297.94s]  Thank you. Oh, you're big. Uh, let's get a few of, uh, I don't want to do any combinations yet.
[6297.94s -> 6306.97s]  We'll get, we'll start with seven. Cool looking though. Cool looking. I think, isn't nightbot
[6306.97s -> 6318.50s]  broken right now too? Don't have a weapon to get rid of those. All right. I'm going to go, let's go
[6319.14s -> 6342.81s]  this way. Is water death? How do I get rid of these? Isn't there like a gun or something I
[6342.81s -> 6372.25s]  can use? It's water. I don't have it yet. Okay. All right. I, what do I want to do now? What do they
[6372.25s -> 6377.78s]  eat? What do you guys eat? They eat fruits. All right. I have fruits. I need to upgrade.
[6379.45s -> 6398.04s]  I need to upgrade my pens bad now. All right. Is that also that big guy down there? Right.
[6413.88s -> 6434.34s]  So let's do this. What kind of plorts of these? Oh, 34. Yep. I'll take it. Oh, they can jump
[6434.34s -> 6455.72s]  right out of here. Shit. It's okay. No guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, come on. Stop 425.
[6456.36s -> 6473.11s]  Your hairline is crooked. No, it's because this hair, look, my hairline is not crooked. It's just,
[6473.11s -> 6480.81s]  this is falling over this way. Uh, by the way, congratulations on your 998th timeout.
[6480.81s -> 6500.06s]  Whoever said that? Why are they? Oh my God. I forgot they're in the sun. I need the sun shield
[6500.06s -> 6519.78s]  thing. That's a lot. Um, oh my God. Okay. Hold on. I got a lot of stuff going on. What are these
[6519.78s -> 6543.05s]  worth? Only 19. That's it. I gotta feed them too. They're probably, yeah, they're hungry. 35. Damn.
[6543.05s -> 6554.81s]  All right. Hold on a second. Okay. Looking good. I need more plorts.
[6554.81s -> 6584.41s]  All right. I got money to work with now. Where are your eyebrows? I have a big brow bone and it messes
[6584.41s -> 6628.18s]  them up. 1600 bucks. Let's go. Let's go. This needs way, this has got to go way faster. Soil.
[6629.40s -> 6641.61s]  I'm going to have, I need fruits. So I'm going to do this too. I have two slimes that eat fruits.
[6641.61s -> 6654.73s]  Okay. So that's good. That'll produce much faster. Let's go. All right. Uh, right. Okay. I need the
[6654.73s -> 6666.30s]  solar shield sensitive to light and then let's make the height more too. Okay. All right. Now
[6666.30s -> 6675.61s]  you guys hopefully can't fly out. Maybe you can. Hope not. How you guys doing over here? Good.
[6676.17s -> 6685.93s]  All right. This is going, this is automatically doing it. Good. Okay. I don't think they can get
[6685.93s -> 6711.14s]  out. I think we're good. They're safe in there. Your wig is crooked. My wig? Oh, all right. We're
[6711.14s -> 6725.72s]  going to do one more pole. One more pole because there's a bunch of, uh, ports to get. All right.
[6725.72s -> 6752.87s]  Suck it up already. Let's go. Suck it up already. Let's go this way. So they eat fruits and their,
[6752.87s -> 6766.34s]  um, plorts are worth a lot, right? 34. I got to really start to get more of those. They're okay
[6766.34s -> 6776.39s]  in here for now. No one's having a problem. They're all fine. I don't want anything else to do. Do I
[6776.39s -> 6782.97s]  want someone else here? No, this is, this is the best pen that I have. Yeah. So I got to keep that
[6782.97s -> 6794.18s]  in mind. Looking for a pole. No, I think I'm maybe just said something that sounded like pole. Perfect.
[6794.18s -> 6809.05s]  This is ready. So this is a vegetable. I'm going to replace this with a fruit because I have
[6809.05s -> 6819.06s]  vegetables here and these are better, higher quality. Pull all the carrots out. I need a fruit.
[6820.10s -> 6831.08s]  I'm going to go try to find like a high quality fruit. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.
[6831.08s -> 6859.93s]  It's foods in here. There you go. Yeah. Eat up. I tried to make it. All right. I'm on a mission for a
[6859.93s -> 6877.26s]  really cool, delicious fruit. Maybe backwards because I want to replace the carrots. Eat it up.
[6877.26s -> 6891.56s]  That's right. I cannot go this way. Nevermind. Because there's the pog fruit, but there's
[6891.56s -> 6897.86s]  probably something else too, right? It has to be. Qberry is probably the best thing to find in this
[6897.86s -> 6915.50s]  area. Maybe I'll look for it. Or is it? All right. Fruits. Fruits are chickens. Eventually I'm going
[6915.50s -> 6927.66s]  to need a lot of chickens, I think. I think I'm just going to head to the unexplored area.
[6927.66s -> 6939.16s]  That's probably the best idea. Just in case, I'm going to pick these up. There's a very real
[6939.16s -> 6946.58s]  possibility I don't find any fruit. And if that's the case, I will punch through my monitor as hard
[6946.58s -> 6969.18s]  as I can. Because like, I can't believe I didn't find any fruit. The people egging me on, by the
[6969.18s -> 6988.31s]  way. Come on, Quinn. I actually don't remember the last time I truly tried to break something
[6988.31s -> 6992.23s]  like that because of, I don't know. The only thing I can think of is when I used to play Super Nintendo
[6993.27s -> 6998.95s]  or some Nintendo game back when I was younger. And I told you this before, but you grip the
[6998.95s -> 7002.95s]  controller so hard and you try to like, almost like you're tearing it in half and you're just like,
[7003.67s -> 7009.19s]  and all you hear is like, just, just components crackling inside the controller. It's just,
[7011.03s -> 7015.59s]  you're like, all right, I'm fine. Just the crunches inside. Yeah.
[7015.59s -> 7032.44s]  But no, I like throw in a controller or something into the screen or into the wall.
[7034.15s -> 7044.26s]  No, my brain thinks probably five to 10 minutes ahead. A lot of times like that. And I just, if
[7044.90s -> 7052.39s]  there's a hole in your, I have to fix that. I like the drywall is fucked up now. That's a whole
[7052.39s -> 7060.31s]  project. That's a whole weekend project now that I'm making for myself. I have to, how do you fix
[7060.31s -> 7066.60s]  a hole in drywall YouTube video? Okay. All right. I need to go get like plaster. I need to go get
[7066.60s -> 7074.28s]  this material. I have to, I don't want to do, I don't want to do that. No. My rage is contained
[7074.28s -> 7088.06s]  by how lazy I am to do household maintenance. Sorry. If throwing a controller onto the ground,
[7088.06s -> 7097.08s]  boom, it blows up. Pieces kind of go everywhere. I don't want to do that. I mean, I got a dog,
[7098.02s -> 7102.33s]  right? I don't want to, what if like auto is nearby or something, right?
[7102.33s -> 7108.84s]  Oh, what if like a week later, I don't get all the pieces and I step on it. I don't, you know,
[7108.84s -> 7116.98s]  I'm not, I don't. Oh, trust me. There have been times. Oh yeah. There have been times
[7116.98s -> 7119.62s]  when I have just been like, I want to fucking eat this.
[7119.70s -> 7130.20s]  I want to smash this thing, but it's just, it's, it's built out of this idea that I don't want to
[7130.20s -> 7136.20s]  do the housework that required afterwards. I, you know, maybe I should get a, like a foam controller.
[7138.57s -> 7148.12s]  Do they make those? Do they make little like kind of squishy toy controller things for your
[7148.12s -> 7155.06s]  controller? Cause what if you just threw that and it was just like a, a nerf controller? Yeah.
[7155.38s -> 7166.65s]  The nerf controller is real. If I went over somebody's house and instead of just two or three
[7166.65s -> 7173.35s]  regular PlayStation five controllers, they had these foam made out of clay controllers.
[7173.35s -> 7178.55s]  And that's all they had. I'd be like, you, you, you need to work on your temper. You're like,
[7178.55s -> 7184.74s]  why do you, you own, why do you have these? I'm, I'm anticipating that that control is going to
[7184.74s -> 7194.04s]  get thrown tonight while we're here at your house. Okay. These guys, I mean, they're, they're, they're
[7194.04s -> 7203.00s]  at your house. Okay. These guys, I need, I, what did I do with all the fruit that I just had?
[7203.56s -> 7219.99s]  What did I do with all the fruit that I just had in my pocket? You, oh, I fed the big guy. God
[7219.99s -> 7237.91s]  damn it. I did. Didn't I? All right. It's time. It's time to set the pink slimes free because
[7237.91s -> 7250.25s]  they're not, the money is not worth very much. And I want to make room for the next group and
[7250.33s -> 7259.10s]  we're going to set them free. Good luck guys. Thanks for being the start of the business.
[7261.42s -> 7283.06s]  Excellent work. Okay. Over here with your friends and there's a big patch of carrots here.
[7283.70s -> 7289.06s]  See you guys later. Thanks for, thanks for coming to the stream guys. Appreciate it. Thanks for
[7289.06s -> 7308.60s]  hanging out. Thanks for the bits. Yep. Thank you. All right. One, a few more of these. These are
[7308.60s -> 7320.38s]  currently the most expensive. Should I do more than 10 or 20 in one thing? I don't think so.
[7324.84s -> 7331.50s]  Although that's a big pen. I can fit a lot. Might as well. And then I have to get fruits.
[7332.70s -> 7363.99s]  No bullshit. Fruits. There we go. Okay. Cute slime. Yeah. This is vegetable, but whatever.
[7363.99s -> 7379.72s]  I'll take it. Um, we're already, I already got, I already got a bunch of those. Ooh, what's that?
[7380.36s -> 7397.74s]  Fruits. There we go. Finally. Chicken. Uh, I don't need this lettuce. I'll take some more, uh,
[7398.22s -> 7418.23s]  chickens. All right. I have a ton of these. I have 20. That's probably way too much, but whatever.
[7427.43s -> 7444.76s]  Oh, that's a little, uh, what's that? Ooh. Okay. So there's this little area over here. I think I
[7444.76s -> 7480.39s]  got to go back. Wait. Cool. Just give me, just pick up the pink florts as well. Fruit. Oh shit.
[7480.39s -> 7500.90s]  Tons of chickens too. The right chickens. Shit. Um, I want the chickens. They're going to be so
[7500.90s -> 7507.90s]  important. It's very soon here. Once I need to actually start getting meat, probably make a
[7507.90s -> 7528.17s]  second pen. What's my favorite book? Um, is it a meme for me to say, um, one of the song of ice
[7528.17s -> 7540.63s]  and fire books? That's probably the last real book that I read. It's funny how that turned me off to
[7540.63s -> 7548.76s]  reading books like forever. I've read every single song of ice and fire book. I was so into it.
[7548.76s -> 7552.68s]  And then I just like, I was like, Oh, the other book is like just never coming out.
[7553.70s -> 7587.69s]  I'm never reading ever again. Okay. Time to go back and start building the fruit here. Of course
[7587.69s -> 7612.10s]  it's the game of Thrones book. Show teeth so we can prove if you have cigarette stains. I don't
[7612.10s -> 7648.28s]  think so. Your teeth are made out of plastic. All right. Let's put in. Ooh, wait. All right.
[7648.28s -> 7661.77s]  Pog fruit going in. Is this fully upgraded? I don't think I don't want to do that. All right.
[7661.77s -> 7670.12s]  So I got fruits coming. I have a bunch of chickens now. I have too many chickens,
[7670.12s -> 7683.56s]  so I got to be ready for this. All right. Good to go. Cool. Looks good. Let's feed you. Get some
[7683.56s -> 7702.78s]  good shit. And then what should I, should I combine the, should I make, I don't know. What
[7702.78s -> 7726.26s]  should I combine next? I'm not, I don't think I'm going to put these, the, Ooh, nice. Okay. I think
[7726.26s -> 7738.39s]  they could fit in here for now. I'm just going to go right to bed. Okay. Now I need a music box
[7741.24s -> 7750.73s]  and automatic feeder. All right. We're going to put a bunch of fruits in here. I think
[7763.38s -> 7768.36s]  showing your teeth is a threat. I got, I'm a dog or something.
[7780.26s -> 7790.06s]  I think you're a dog. I ain't doing it. I ain't doing it. I know the meme. I know I've read it
[7790.06s -> 7793.34s]  a thousand times. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. And then I do like a snarl
[7793.34s -> 7813.13s]  into the camera. I refuse. I'm not doing it. All right. Come on, hurry up. New quest. What do you
[7813.13s -> 7824.95s]  know? Beatrix Labu off on another rival adventure. Rival adventure. Why did I add a word? I don't get
[7824.95s -> 7831.35s]  it. Why did I do that? Uh, and we'll, and didn't think to take her good pal, sometimes rival
[7833.77s -> 7841.42s]  and forever mentor. What is happening? Why did I, why did I go like this? Well,
[7841.42s -> 7847.26s]  what do you know? Beatrix Labu off on another rival adventure. Why did I go like this?
[7849.53s -> 7855.82s]  That was weird. Okay. Seriously. Next time you go off running off to dangerous uncharted territory,
[7855.82s -> 7861.88s]  could you at least give me a heads up? Okay. Help collect all those valuable resources that
[7861.88s -> 7867.34s]  seem to be scattered all over the island. Why you think I wasn't going to do a little recon
[7867.34s -> 7880.07s]  of my own? What good are surveillance statistics if they can't snoop on stuff? Why am I making
[7880.07s -> 7886.79s]  words up? Anyway, be careful out there. The island gives me a kind of weird vibe,
[7886.79s -> 7893.99s]  so I'm going to keep poking around. This is why I don't read. I, I have been waiting for
[7894.79s -> 7900.17s]  the winds of winter for 10 years. I stopped reading books and I've lost the ability to
[7900.17s -> 7908.26s]  comprehend reading. Okay. Since I know you're starting from scratch out there, take this
[7908.26s -> 7920.76s]  refinery link. Should you make things easier for you? I'll just, bro, I gotta be honest.
[7921.86s -> 7925.46s]  The only reading I've done is just reading the back of cereal boxes when I'm bored
[7925.46s -> 7929.85s]  eating cereal in the morning. You know what I mean? That's the only reading I've done.
[7929.85s -> 7935.37s]  It's just the what's on the back of the cocoa puffs box. Oh, it's another maze. By the way,
[7935.37s -> 7940.10s]  let me design those. Let me design those fucking things. Have you noticed that those have gotten
[7940.10s -> 7950.04s]  worse? Those, the back of the cereal box activity things have gotten worse. It's just an easy shitty
[7950.04s -> 7955.56s]  maze now. There used to be so much cool shit. There'd be a word search. There'd be a maze over
[7955.56s -> 7961.03s]  here. There'd be find the 10 leprechauns. What happened? There's just, there's don't,
[7961.03s -> 7979.22s]  they don't want to do that anymore. Oh, here's a mad lib. Those are for children. Yes. And I'm
[7979.22s -> 7987.32s]  saying they're not, they're not there anymore. No, I'm sorry. They're for children. And they're
[7987.32s -> 7991.98s]  also for adults in a bathrobe at two o'clock in the morning eating Honey Nut Cheerios out of a
[7991.98s -> 7996.28s]  fucking bowl because you're hungry at two o'clock in the morning. And I'm sorry. Who am I going to
[7996.28s -> 8004.87s]  talk to at 2 a.m.? What am I going to do at 2 a.m.? That is the box is facing me and it's, I don't
[8004.87s -> 8011.34s]  know, a little dark outside. Is nobody really around? It's just, it's me in the box. It's just
[8011.34s -> 8019.38s]  me in the box. So I'm sorry. Yes. I read the little activity thing on the back of if it's like 3 a.m.
[8019.38s -> 8037.62s]  and I'm eating Honey Nut Cheerios in a bathrobe. Oh, here we go. Don't act like you don't pick up
[8037.62s -> 8044.60s]  random shit to read in the bathroom. I'm not saying they do that with the Honey Nut Cheerios box,
[8044.60s -> 8060.95s]  but you know what? It's the same. It's in the same space. It sits in the same spot. It's just,
[8060.95s -> 8065.91s]  it doesn't, it's just shit that doesn't even matter that you're just passing time with two minutes.
[8094.94s -> 8100.62s]  Somebody said, dude, you realize the toilet bowl is not for the cereal, right? Like I'm
[8100.62s -> 8116.89s]  I'm putting the cereal into the toilet bowl and Captain Crunch still has puzzles on it.
[8116.89s -> 8122.47s]  He did it with coffee recently while I was asleep. I'm horrified. He talked about it on stream and
[8122.47s -> 8125.91s]  I learned about it hours later. Well, we talked about when I drank the espresso while I was taking
[8125.91s -> 8135.43s]  a shit. That was a little unhinged. I will agree. I felt like it. I felt, I don't care. I felt like
[8135.43s -> 8145.85s]  doing it. That's it. I felt like I just felt like it. That's it. That's all. I don't need to explain.
[8145.85s -> 8150.50s]  There's no explanation. It actually is not an explanation. People are like, dude, why,
[8150.50s -> 8161.98s]  why did you do that? There is none. There's nothing to explain. It's just, I felt like it
[8161.98s -> 8171.18s]  one day. I was like, I'm going to do this today. That's it. And it was, it was like, whatever.
[8173.06s -> 8179.21s]  It wasn't a big deal. It was, it actually wasn't a big deal. Okay. Let me explain. For those of you
[8179.21s -> 8184.73s]  that don't know or weren't here or whatever. I don't know. Like, like three years ago, whatever
[8184.73s -> 8191.78s]  it was, it was like, I don't know, like a few months ago, I was late to a stream and I like to
[8191.78s -> 8198.65s]  have a coffee before the stream. And I made an espresso. The espresso was just a little,
[8198.65s -> 8205.70s]  it's just a little thing. It's not even two ounces of liquid. So that's a lot of money, by the way.
[8207.61s -> 8213.29s]  So I make an espresso. I'm already like five to 10 minutes, probably late to the stream. So I'm just
[8213.29s -> 8220.36s]  like, okay, usually it's you drink the coffee and then, okay, I need, I don't really need to go
[8220.36s -> 8232.02s]  this far. Coffee is a, it's a diuretic. I, coffee in the morning gets me moving. Right? So I was
[8232.02s -> 8237.88s]  like, you know what? Like, I'm, I'm late to the stream already. I'm just, I'm just going to bring
[8237.88s -> 8242.04s]  this into the bathroom. Like, what the fuck do I care? It's one and a half ounces of liquid. I
[8242.04s -> 8250.81s]  didn't even care. And I sat there and was just sipping on an espresso while I was, you know,
[8251.37s -> 8261.38s]  getting prepared to what? That's not, is that really that weird? And I remember sitting there
[8261.38s -> 8275.98s]  going like, all right, I've only, that's only, I've done it once. I haven't done that ever again.
[8275.98s -> 8298.31s]  How are we doing over here? Good. It doesn't matter. That's kind of a weird vibe. I, I disagree.
[8298.87s -> 8305.51s]  It was something that I just did one time and I was like, you know what? Fuck it. I'm going to
[8305.51s -> 8312.22s]  do this once because I feel like it. And I will tell you, it was, it was not a negative experience.
[8312.22s -> 8316.22s]  It was not, I don't want to say it was a positive experience, but there was nothing. I got through
[8316.22s -> 8321.88s]  the coffee and I was done and I was ready to go. And I, I skipped like 10 straight minutes of like
[8321.88s -> 8333.26s]  sipping a coffee before the stream. All right. Let me go upgrade something. It wasn't only one
[8333.26s -> 8354.79s]  time. It was the only one time. That's it. Oh, I need ore. Okay. 10 of these. I feel like I need
[8354.79s -> 8378.87s]  this. All right. This is for any 10 of the funny lords. Okay. Okay. Let's do that. And I will load
[8378.87s -> 8388.42s]  this up momentarily. How are you guys doing? You all right? I think I need to make this go faster.
[8390.79s -> 8401.54s]  Yeah. People hungry in there. How are you? Let's do increase soil, faster growth. Looks good. Are
[8401.54s -> 8417.99s]  you at the age where you have a magazine rack in the bathroom yet? Um, no, I think I have to do
[8417.99s -> 8438.17s]  another. Yeah. I need more food. I just do. This is vegetables. I need root or yes. Okay. Did you
[8438.17s -> 8443.05s]  eat a three course meal on the crapper? I have not heard anybody say crapper in a long time. That's
[8443.05s -> 8454.68s]  impressive. Um, well, no, that's not true, but whatever. All right. I'm going to get this one.
[8454.68s -> 8471.38s]  Should I just put vegetable in there now? I'll be back. Um, I gotta get off this island. I feel like
[8471.38s -> 8478.14s]  I've seen a lot of the, uh, feel like I gotta go up here or this way because I've gotten a lot,
[8478.14s -> 8485.43s]  most pretty much everything off here. Are there any other slimes that are here? I need 10 of
[8485.43s -> 8516.04s]  these. I need 10 ports, 10 of the bunny ports. I need that. Okay. I need 10 of these. Come on.
[8516.04s -> 8541.48s]  Three or somebody else eat something. I missed a lucky slime. What does that mean? I've, if you
[8541.48s -> 8569.83s]  eat the veggies, they need them. That's it. One more. Where is it? When do you just please? All
[8569.83s -> 8595.58s]  right. 10. Good. I can now upgrade the vacuum cleaner. We're going to blink for like an hour.
[8595.58s -> 8598.78s]  I'm going to just do another, I'm going to do another pog fruit tree. I think it makes the
[8598.78s -> 8610.82s]  most sense. Oh shit. Look at this. Why was this one so fertilized or whatever? That's a lot.
[8610.82s -> 8641.38s]  Okay. 19. I guess I could feed this, right? Isn't there one down there? Anything else over here?
[8641.38s -> 8646.30s]  All right. This is the only area I've not been. So let's just take a quick look.
[8646.30s -> 8667.10s]  Hmm. Nothing over here. Actually there was, it was a hen.
[8667.10s -> 8695.66s]  I think that's good. Although I'd like a, I think that's good. I'll get the upgrade for the
[8695.66s -> 8712.22s]  vacuum cleaner. Ooh, what's that? You need to take a cold shower chat. Is there any data?
[8712.22s -> 8719.78s]  Isn't there science behind that? Taking a, like finishing your shower with like it not being hot,
[8719.78s -> 8732.14s]  hot, hot is actually not a bad thing. Can you play trombone champ? I actually, I'll play trombone
[8732.14s -> 8742.26s]  champ probably maybe tomorrow. Cause I want to do breath of the wild tomorrow. Is trombone
[8742.26s -> 8752.12s]  champ on the switch or is it a steam game? Yeah. I'll do breath of the wild and trombone champ.
[8752.12s -> 8765.72s]  Is it on switch? Steam. Okay. The, this has got to get an upgrade. Yeah. I got to feed the chickens
[8765.72s -> 8780.30s]  and shit. Okay. I need to feed. You guys are good. Holy shit. That's a lot. All right. You need food.
[8780.30s -> 8798.12s]  All right. That's good to go. Suck this up. It's just on steam. All right. Oh fuck. I already have
[8798.12s -> 8814.25s]  a lot of those. Probably have two grand after this. What's the price? The price, I'm going to go to bed.
[8814.25s -> 8820.76s]  Maybe the price will increase tomorrow. What about splatoon? I did want to play splatoon eventually.
[8829.77s -> 8849.85s]  No price change, whatever. All right. Sucking these up, right? Remind me to keep 10 of these.
[8849.85s -> 8856.50s]  Otherwise I will forget. I got this 10 in the, in the chamber thing here. Okay.
[8869.59s -> 8882.14s]  15. Okay. All right. Now pretty good payday coming out here.
[8886.92s -> 8895.77s]  Very nice. Okay. What are these worth? Like 30? These were 30 yesterday. Whatever.
[8900.94s -> 8929.13s]  I need whatever that is. He doesn't understand economics.
[8931.26s -> 8944.71s]  I know I'm flooding the market. I know. Okay. Cotton port. Oh, I have to shoot them into here.
[8944.71s -> 8961.70s]  Right. How do I do that? There we go. All right. So I can, now I can get resources from a node.
[8961.70s -> 8975.80s]  Shakes loose science resources from nodes in the environment. What does that mean? What does that
[8975.80s -> 9003.16s]  mean? A node? Well, I know a node when I see one. Yeah. Okay. Still have money. Hmm. The water
[9003.16s -> 9016.81s]  sprouts. Oh, okay. Cool. So I can actually use those now. That's pretty sick. What's down here?
[9016.81s -> 9037.11s]  Oh, it's just behind everything. Okay. All right. Time to upgrade. How much is it to go the, the
[9037.11s -> 9047.91s]  area over here? I want to go over here or down here. Let's see. I think it's like a thousand,
[9047.91s -> 9068.02s]  2000, 1800 for the den. Oh, okay. That's the place to put the, where the light doesn't get
[9068.02s -> 9086.01s]  in there. The archway, ancient ruins. Okay. How are we doing? No more ports, but I definitely
[9086.01s -> 9092.55s]  have an, I definitely have to play. Let's restock the food. This is going to get bad if I don't.
[9093.35s -> 9115.61s]  Oh my goodness. There's so many chickens in here. Um, what, what am I supposed to do? Feed
[9116.57s -> 9158.71s]  Vitamizer? There's a lot. All right. Feed, feed, feed, feed growing. Okay. Right here. All right.
[9158.71s -> 9166.52s]  Good. Go. Okay. There's way too many chickens, but I need somebody, something that eats meat.
[9168.06s -> 9183.83s]  They eat meat, but do I really? I don't know. Okay. It's time to, where should I go? Is this
[9183.83s -> 9198.46s]  boat? Can I use this boat? Let's check it out. Wake up, dude. I'm awake. The boat costs money.
[9198.46s -> 9212.89s]  I don't think I can activate the boat. I did get that node thing though. Let's check that out.
[9213.67s -> 9228.65s]  Why are you angry? What? I'm not angry. Why do you think I'm angry? Why is everyone saying wake up?
[9228.65s -> 9254.23s]  I'm looking for one of those oil nodes. Another one down here. Oh, wait a minute. I see one right
[9254.23s -> 9284.87s]  here. All right. Give me something new. Jelly stone. Ooh. Okay. Jelly stone. This is box.
[9284.87s -> 9302.84s]  Wouldn't, this is another one of those somewhere over here, isn't there? Veggies. Oh, okay. Here,
[9302.84s -> 9323.59s]  look. Eat these. That's a veggie, right? Oh, I got it. Okay. That's the cube one. That's when
[9323.59s -> 9333.66s]  everyone's like, you got to find that one. I got a cube berry. All right. I got to make sure I grow
[9333.66s -> 9363.77s]  this. I don't want to forget something. I'm thinking I'm just going to go back. Cue berry,
[9363.77s -> 9371.10s]  resident sleeper. Cue berry. Chat's on something today. To be fair, the entire stream feels like
[9371.10s -> 9400.23s]  we all shared a joint. Does it? So is this, is this a food? This jelly stone? What does it do?
[9400.23s -> 9415.58s]  Is it just like a, is it a buff or something? Oh, here we go. Don't touch those. Those are mine.
[9420.71s -> 9433.99s]  Deep brine. Not safe for drinking. Water from a slime sea that's been filtered by the subterranean
[9433.99s -> 9443.16s]  core below Rainbow Island. It's denser than freshwater and loaded with salt. Okay. What do
[9443.16s -> 9477.22s]  I do with it? Bong water. Nothing else over here. Oh, yeah, there is. I remember there was one in
[9477.22s -> 9484.52s]  the cave somewhere, right? Yeah. All right. I got a couple of new resources. What the hell do I do
[9484.52s -> 9500.58s]  with this shit? How hard is the jet pack to get? I don't know. Let me go look. I'll make some money
[9500.58s -> 9517.72s]  here. Put it in the refinery. Yeah. That's a good idea. All right. You are fine, but you...
[9521.66s -> 9531.08s]  Where's my second tree over here? I really hate to do this, but I have to delete this.
[9532.94s -> 9564.62s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. This one's not upgraded. I'll do to this one. There we go. All right. Let's
[9564.62s -> 9572.58s]  collect some cash. Cause I've got a lot of florts now. Yeah. I'm going to have this again. I'll be,
[9572.58s -> 9579.18s]  I'm going to have, I'm going to end up with like three grand. Oh yeah. You better believe it. Look
[9579.18s -> 9627.16s]  at this. I'm going to have like two grand or at least look at this. All right. It's time to
[9627.16s -> 9651.08s]  collect this pen. I need a new group of slimes. All right. Refinery. Okay. I've got jelly stones
[9651.08s -> 9662.49s]  in here now. So what's the, how do I get the jet pack? Jet pack is one, 10 radiant ore,
[9662.49s -> 9678.55s]  10 phosphor plorts. What's that? I can get those. Where do you get the radiant ore? Check caves.
[9678.55s -> 9688.39s]  All right. Let's do a collection here.
[9717.03s -> 9726.17s]  Okay. I wonder if I should upgrade people now. Like I should people, what's with my voice?
[9727.21s -> 9759.27s]  Should I combine the, the ghosts with the pink or something? Experiments.
[9759.75s -> 9792.28s]  There's food in the dispenser. I think it's garbage though. It is. Okay. I got a lot of money
[9793.18s -> 9796.62s]  and I do anything else with these. I think these are all fully upgraded, right?
[9796.62s -> 9801.35s]  Yep. This is fully upgraded. This is fully upgraded. It does have to,
[9801.35s -> 9809.69s]  I don't think I need that though. This, this is fully, wait no it's not. Safely and gently
[9809.69s -> 9813.37s]  moves elder chickens away from the younger generations and stores them in a collector.
[9815.99s -> 9832.86s]  Um, should I just do that? I feel like they're all getting old. There was only one elder chicken
[9832.86s -> 9859.99s]  in this whole coop. That was 1300 bucks. Okay. Well, this is good. All right. I'm going to,
[9859.99s -> 9899.14s]  where do I go? Where should I go? Southwest and down here. Cubes. So now we are going to do this.
[9903.34s -> 9924.65s]  Uh, yeah. Get rid of this shit. I just want double cubes. I have to start feeding
[9924.65s -> 9928.33s]  chickens to somebody because that this is getting ridiculous.
[9943.45s -> 9964.17s]  They eat meat, right? I think so, right? Veggies and meat. I'm just scared that I'm going to find
[9964.17s -> 9981.16s]  a slime that only eats meat and I'm going to waste all these. Is that wrong to think that?
[9981.16s -> 9986.36s]  All right. I need a, I need a new slime. I got this pen over here. I'm not,
[9986.36s -> 9995.05s]  just not being used for anything. What are you doing over here? Oh, you're just hungry.
[9995.05s -> 10003.78s]  Oh, okay. Well here, that's a special cube. That's cube fruit. That's just for you.
[10007.05s -> 10016.63s]  There you go. All right. Speaking of cube fruit, I should probably store this
[10017.99s -> 10034.14s]  or feed it to these guys over here. Yeah. All right. I'm going to the Southwest. Special dork fruit.
[10039.30s -> 10052.73s]  All right. Let's move. There's too many tabby slimes. I cracked the super mysterious code
[10052.81s -> 10058.31s]  that was sent to me. It was complex. I believe that AI, I believe that the AI that created
[10058.31s -> 10064.23s]  this code displays a comparable intellect to my own. So very advanced, almost alien.
[10064.23s -> 10089.00s]  What did it say? Okay. Hello. Who's this? Hold up, Beatrix. Are you there? It's me, Ogden Ortiz.
[10089.00s -> 10092.49s]  Are you off on a big new adventure on a mysterious island filled with secrets and danger and maybe
[10092.49s -> 10097.06s]  a few succulent fruits and veggies the world has never seen before? You know, I had to ask.
[10097.62s -> 10102.33s]  Ever since you got me a steady supply of Cucadoba fruits, I've been reaching for
[10102.33s -> 10111.30s]  even greater culinary heights, getting pretty tired of eating Cucadoba pie, Cucadoba souffle,
[10111.30s -> 10119.96s]  Cucadoba pudding, Cucadoba corn, carne, Cucadoba corn. You get the idea. I'm running out of ideas
[10119.96s -> 10133.83s]  and willpower. If you see something new, please tell me about it. Okay. Okay. Oh, I got this.
[10133.83s -> 10150.84s]  Finally. How do I turn that on? How do I use the water? Do I have to suck water up first?
[10150.84s -> 10172.95s]  Is that other tree upgraded all the way? No, it's not. This is democracy manifest. Oh,
[10172.95s -> 10182.49s]  that's a nice chokehold, sir. It's one of my favorite videos of all time. I mean,
[10182.49s -> 10196.90s]  it's a classic video. All right. It's in Southwest. I'm heading Southwest. A meal?
[10197.46s -> 10229.22s]  A succulent Chinese meal? Hot on. Farewell. Get your hands. What an outrageous video. Show it and
[10229.22s -> 10248.49s]  dump it. I can't. I don't, I don't think I can. I don't know. I don't know what word for word
[10251.22s -> 10270.97s]  fry. Um, I'll try. Is the charge eating? Can I have subtitles? It's going to be hard for me to do this.
[10270.97s -> 10294.71s]  Let me turn on subtitles. Okay. I'm going to, uh, let me see how this works. What is the charge?
[10294.71s -> 10300.87s]  Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal? Okay. Let me try this. I got to turn him off though.
[10300.87s -> 10315.77s]  All right. So this has been muted. Okay. I'm going to try. What is the charge eating a meal?
[10315.77s -> 10329.24s]  A succulent Chinese meal? What is this? This is not the video. Hold on. Wait, this is the wrong
[10329.24s -> 10353.03s]  video. Just skip to 15 seconds. Okay. I'm under what? Okay. Gentlemen, this is democracy
[10353.03s -> 10360.54s]  manifest. What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal? Democracy manifest.
[10361.98s -> 10369.94s]  I need, this is the wrong video. Give me the right video. He keeps cutting around. This is like the
[10369.94s -> 10391.85s]  news report of the guy. This is the news report. Okay. I'll do this one. Hold on. Let me do it again.
[10394.09s -> 10406.87s]  Okay. Let's put this one on. I'm ready. I have to really prepare for this.
[10408.66s -> 10450.78s]  Okay. Are we ready? Are we ready? Okay. Let's go. No, you don't want, we don't want audio for you.
[10450.78s -> 10470.02s]  This is, this is not even right. What? Hold on. I'm not showing any under rest. I'm, what? Gentlemen,
[10470.02s -> 10479.16s]  this is tab, tabock receive manifest. Ever look at the headlock here. See that chap over there
[10479.16s -> 10505.16s]  joined. Oh my piousness. This bloke who got me on. Chinese male. Eating a meal? Eating succulent
[10505.16s -> 10520.01s]  Chinese male. Succulent Chinese male. Oh, that's a nice headlock, sir. I see that you know that
[10520.01s -> 10534.22s]  you're cute. Alright, let me try this. I'll give it a go. Here we go. Just a short breather. I could
[10534.22s -> 10548.78s]  speak showing anything under arrest. I'm under water. Gentlemen, this is tobacco receive manifest.
[10548.78s -> 10555.98s]  Ever look at that headlock there. See that chap over there joined or by piousness is the bloke
[10555.98s -> 10565.45s]  who got me on the penis before. Well, what reason? What is the charge? Eating on the older succulent
[10565.45s -> 10575.91s]  Chinese male. Oh, that's a nice headlock there. Stop. I see that you know you're cute over here.
[10575.91s -> 10605.43s]  Wood and user. Are you waiting to receive my? I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't do it. I can't do it.
[10605.43s -> 10626.17s]  What the fuck? What the fuck? I can't, dude. I can't. I gotta go back to play the slime game.
[10640.98s -> 10647.14s]  That's in the video. I did not. I forgot that was in the video. I thought that was a wrong
[10647.14s -> 10654.87s]  caption. I forgot that he says that. It's like, holy shit, dude. What? I forgot that was actually
[10654.87s -> 10676.49s]  in the video. OK, we're going to go down to the southwest. Did he beat champion gundyr already?
[10678.87s -> 10714.52s]  Yes, I did. It was very easy. Is this a cube tree? Oh, the cash in there. All right, I'm down in the
[10714.52s -> 10720.82s]  southwest. What am I looking for? I have to open up one of those other places, right? I gotta,
[10720.82s -> 10732.63s]  I gotta hurry up. I got, I got money coming in. Bring the mustache back. I can't, I can't do it.
[10733.19s -> 10750.71s]  Is there an audio delay? There shouldn't be. Is it one of the other? I feel like I have to go into
[10750.71s -> 10760.18s]  this or something, right? This is what, like two grand? 1800? Can you do the ooh, ooh, voice? I've
[10760.18s -> 10768.89s]  been waiting a long time. No, I promised I would never do it again. If there's a reason to do it,
[10768.89s -> 10778.09s]  maybe I would. I kind of don't know where to go. I could feed the big guy. I could try to go this
[10778.09s -> 10787.46s]  way. Let me, let me look at what's over here. I feel like that's where I need to go. Wait,
[10787.46s -> 10798.31s]  there's a voice desync? No, there shouldn't be. No, there really shouldn't be. I turned all that
[10798.31s -> 10817.67s]  off. The webcam is late. Oh, it really shouldn't be. It's probably because of the low FPS on this
[10817.67s -> 10828.90s]  piece of shit. Yeah, this thing's a piece of crap. Actually, this thing's a piece of crap. But I'm
[10828.90s -> 10835.62s]  one of those people that complains about a product and, and never stops using the product. I just
[10835.62s -> 10858.57s]  complain about it every day. Have I gone up there? I haven't, I need the jet pack. Seems fine now.
[10858.57s -> 10866.97s]  That's weird. All right. I'm going to head over here because I feel like this is where I need to
[10866.97s -> 10883.24s]  go. I need to activate the boat or something. Because if I go this way, what, what, how much
[10883.24s -> 10896.81s]  is this? All right. 1800 bucks. All right, let's go. I can make that right now. I guarantee you,
[10896.81s -> 10911.53s]  I can make that right now. I, okay. I need to get rid of at least a third of these chickens.
[10911.53s -> 10949.05s]  I see you know your judo well. Where's my, uh, cabbage farm? Like the cabbages aren't even
[10949.05s -> 10979.90s]  ready. How is that possible? All right. Here we go. How can, how can it, is it possible that
[10979.90s -> 11009.40s]  there's no cabbage right now? Oh man. Okay. Yeah. I definitely can afford it now. What the fuck is
[11009.40s -> 11035.62s]  that? This is an AI prompt photo for a German enjoying a succulent Chinese meal at a,
[11035.62s -> 11042.65s]  German 95 enjoying a succulent Chinese meal in an upscale restaurant. Oh, I see. They fed the face
[11042.65s -> 11054.60s]  into the, it didn't generate the face. I was going to say this is weird. Let me, I gotta say,
[11054.60s -> 11075.19s]  this is weird. Yeah. I want you to, yeah, I'll show you. This is creepy. I thought it made my face.
[11088.73s -> 11093.37s]  Why am I putting it into my, what's happening to my hair? Why am I putting it in my ears?
[11093.37s -> 11115.29s]  Why am I putting, why am I going into my ears? These look like Tinder profile pictures. It
[11115.29s -> 11132.10s]  really does. Oh, I'm on vacation. What the fuck? Why do I look so weird? Why do I look so strange?
[11132.10s -> 11166.94s]  What is this from? This image right here. This is a toothbrush or whatever. AI is fucked, man.
[11166.94s -> 11192.18s]  It really is. The prompt for this apparently was, what the fuck is this? German 95 enjoying succulent
[11192.18s -> 11200.01s]  Chinese mayonnaise at home in his kitchen. Why do I have sunglasses on my head? What is this one?
[11204.22s -> 11219.00s]  What is going on in this image? Can somebody help me with this? They said Reddit shelf,
[11219.00s -> 11240.06s]  me with my Reddit shelf. It's so funny. Why, why am I so skinny? It can't do text. It's just you in
[11240.06s -> 11254.17s]  the Reddit shelf. But what's even on here? Why is there a sink? There is a sink on the Reddit shelf.
[11254.17s -> 11265.11s]  Look at this right here, right in the middle. What else is even on here? A toilet, an empty toilet
[11265.11s -> 11274.04s]  paper roll, a bunch of Funko pops, some weird Funko pops. These like backpacks, a bathroom sink,
[11274.04s -> 11292.36s]  a toilet. What else is it in this room? What is this? What's the shirt? I think that's a whee behind
[11292.36s -> 11316.15s]  me. RIR rims. JC Mr. JC. What is this? Dude, AI is so fucking weird. This shit is, this shit is
[11316.15s -> 11347.18s]  fucked up. It really is. What's on the ground? Unbelievable. Jesus. Okay. All right. There's tons
[11347.18s -> 11357.94s]  of money now and I'm going to open up that of the door. I, okay. The chickens are, this is better.
[11364.06s -> 11380.92s]  Okay. So this is good. That looks good. Looks good. Forty six. I need to hold more
[11380.92s -> 11416.23s]  plorts. I, how do I upgrade my plort holding ability? These are going down in price. Two grand
[11416.23s -> 11429.27s]  probably. I should be able to open it. Would you ever play super monkey ball? Um, I did. I beat it
[11429.27s -> 11434.97s]  already. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that was a melt downstream, right? I had, I had a lot of
[11434.97s -> 11447.98s]  problems with that game. Oh yeah. No, I, that was a, that was kind of a nightmare. I did not expect
[11447.98s -> 11478.79s]  that game to be as hard as it was. That game was hard. Like really hard. Lettuce. German 985's
[11478.79s -> 11503.70s]  gamer room. Then I added a details like Funko Pops. It's crazy. This takes forever. This, they're
[11503.70s -> 11525.72s]  being fed, right? Yep. Don't ignore it. Where's Lala? Where's Lala? You know, I would do it,
[11526.36s -> 11531.48s]  but I think a lot of people ask for it a little too much. We had somebody come in here and ask
[11531.48s -> 11545.08s]  for the, the ooh, ah-ha-ha thing. I don't know if people have been asking a little too much for it.
[11545.08s -> 11547.24s]  I don't know. I mean, people have been asking for it.
[11565.03s -> 11584.36s]  I'm not doing that again for at least three months. That's on, that is only three months
[11584.36s -> 11612.97s]  cool down. I told you three grand. That's exactly what we're doing. Three grand. Three thousand
[11612.97s -> 11636.97s]  dollars. It's going to be pretty close. Almost exact. All right. Now I want to buy the new area.
[11637.61s -> 11652.87s]  But I also want to see what I can do here. Utilities. Portable water tap. Warp tech.
[11652.87s -> 11666.42s]  Okay. Right. Decorations. Upgrades. Water tank. Extra tank. Tank booster. There we go. All right.
[11666.42s -> 11681.21s]  It's 10 tabby plorts and 450. So let me get the tabby plorts. 10 tabby plorts. And let's open this
[11681.21s -> 11725.61s]  up. New area. What the hell is that sound? Ooh. Oh, this is another. Ooh. Okay. Okay. Sorry. I
[11725.61s -> 11739.91s]  have coughed like in your face. So this is just extra space. All right. Is there anything else
[11739.91s -> 11768.65s]  I can do here? Whatever's down here. What's this? Tide pools. So this is all just expansion on the
[11768.65s -> 11776.06s]  conservatory. How do I get out of here? Like out of the island? Because I mean, look, there's
[11776.06s -> 11785.26s]  definitely at least another area or two to explore, right? How do I get out of here?
[11785.26s -> 11801.77s]  Do I have to feed the giant slimes? Okay. Where am I now? Which are the big slimes should I feed?
[11801.77s -> 11820.73s]  The vegetable one or the fruit one? The veggie one? Does the veggie one also eat meat? Which
[11820.73s -> 11826.57s]  one of them eats meat? Because I'm going to bring like a hundred chickens. No. Damn it. I don't think
[11826.57s -> 11838.36s]  I even have enough vegetables. The pink one will eat the meat. Because there's this one here and
[11838.36s -> 11844.66s]  this one here. One of them's fruits, one's vegetables. Pink is any. All right. So we're
[11844.66s -> 11848.55s]  going to feed the big slimes. That's the next. That's the next part. That's the next part of the
[11848.55s -> 11898.41s]  plot. I feel like these have taken so long. That's the deal. Okay. 450. I can carry 30 of each thing.
[11898.41s -> 11910.17s]  Okay. Cool. Jet pack. I don't have it yet. Dash boots. Power core. Don't really need these right
[11910.17s -> 11920.10s]  now, but I definitely wanted that. All right. Let's go. Do you remember why don't you say penis on
[11920.10s -> 11939.16s]  stream? I just did. And I have, what are you talking about? All right. We got to go feed people.
[11939.16s -> 11948.97s]  I need vegetables. I'm just going on a vegetable hunt. That's it. Just picking up a hundred of each
[11948.97s -> 11956.06s]  one. What's my take on kefir? I love kefir. There's kefir in my fridge right now. It's amazing.
[11958.76s -> 11980.55s]  It is amazing. Highly recommend it. You grow your own. Oh no. Grow my own kefir? Look, that's a
[11980.55s -> 11985.77s]  very, that's a huge process that I want nothing to do with. I just want to buy it and drink it.
[11985.85s -> 12006.90s]  It's not that hard. Yeah. Hold on. Is it like making your own kombucha or whatever it is?
[12007.46s -> 12012.26s]  We have to get like that weird circle alien bacteria thing and stick it in. I don't know.
[12012.26s -> 12026.18s]  I don't like it. It's not that hard. Scoby. Yep. It's this weird hockey puck of bacteria
[12026.18s -> 12039.11s]  that sits on top of the kombucha. It's wicked easy, dude. Just leave milk out in the sun.
[12039.51s -> 12044.73s]  Oh yeah. That's how you do it. Thanks for the help. Thanks for the tip on how to make kefir.
[12045.53s -> 12058.28s]  Just leave milk out in the sun. Cool. I guess that's how you do it. It's not how you do it.
[12058.28s -> 12075.70s]  Is it really that difficult to make though for real? It kind of is. It starts with kefir crystals.
[12075.70s -> 12082.20s]  Okay. My parents do it. It's not hard. I don't, it probably doesn't, it's probably not hard,
[12082.20s -> 12085.96s]  but it probably takes a while, doesn't it? How long does it like the fermentation process take?
[12085.96s -> 12094.54s]  At least a couple weeks or something, right? Or at least a week. No, I don't fuck with anything
[12094.54s -> 12098.87s]  like that. I don't fuck with fermentation. I don't fuck with making anything like that ever
[12098.87s -> 12105.80s]  because what you are doing, you are making a fermented product. You are taking milk,
[12105.80s -> 12113.34s]  which I mean, I don't know, man. Like I don't want to make kefir. Oh, I made my own kefir.
[12113.34s -> 12121.48s]  I made my own kombucha and take one sip and instapuke and go to the hospital. I don't feel
[12121.48s -> 12130.22s]  like doing that. Why do that when I can just buy it? Oh, it turns out you made it wrong and
[12130.22s -> 12133.98s]  there's a bunch of other bacteria in this and you just drank, you just drank. Now you're going to
[12133.98s -> 12138.98s]  go to the hospital because you just puked and it's like you instapuked. Wine is fermented. Yeah,
[12138.98s -> 12155.78s]  I'm not waking my own wine in the closet over here. Like people have like, you know, like the FDA and
[12155.78s -> 12162.42s]  shit, right? Or you, I don't know. When you buy kombucha at the store or when you buy kefir from
[12162.42s -> 12167.70s]  the supermarket or whatever, I don't think it's coming from some random dude's closet.
[12168.90s -> 12188.68s]  Isn't there like regulation on the milk? I don't know. I like FDA. Yeah. Okay.
[12189.72s -> 12198.98s]  I don't know. Well, I don't know. It's not, it's not like some guy like on the, I don't know. It's
[12198.98s -> 12204.50s]  not like the back of the carton's like, Hey, my name is Dave. I made this. My name is Dave. I made
[12204.50s -> 12211.22s]  this with my bare feet. Like, okay. That doesn't, no, it's made in a processing facility where
[12211.78s -> 12217.99s]  cleanliness and, you know, this is like, there's the process involved and there's even trained
[12217.99s -> 12222.90s]  employees and people that know what they're doing. I don't know. Maybe, maybe Dave's bare feet
[12224.10s -> 12236.92s]  kombuchas. I don't know. I'm afraid of products that are fermented. Dude, FDA is federally Dave
[12236.92s -> 12249.50s]  approved. You are full of shit. You would not buy, you would not. I'm looking at you right now. I
[12249.50s -> 12253.34s]  moved you. I put you over here. I moved you from over here to over here. I'm reading you up right
[12253.34s -> 12258.30s]  now. If you would not buy a product, if it was called Dave's bare feet kombucha, you wouldn't
[12258.30s -> 12280.22s]  buy it. You wouldn't buy it. I know you wouldn't. I'd probably try it, dude. You don't know me, man.
[12280.22s -> 12302.97s]  I guess not. What about the show called Barefoot Contesta? The show, okay. The show Barefoot
[12302.97s -> 12311.82s]  Contesta is not called Barefoot Contesta's bare feet kombucha. That's, that's, that's not the same.
[12312.14s -> 12322.46s]  The product is called Dave's bare feet kombucha. That's a huge difference. There's a huge difference.
[12322.46s -> 12352.42s]  What about wine? Moving on. Drinking wine. What about wine? No, it's not. That doesn't happen.
[12353.06s -> 12364.25s]  All right. I have a lot of vegetables that I need to prepare. They do that. What about the wine stuff?
[12364.25s -> 12389.02s]  You stomp grapes, dude. Yes, some small batch wine person place is, will do that. Maybe the, when you
[12389.02s -> 12396.84s]  buy the, oh, there's a wine called, isn't there a wine called like Barefeet? The most popular wine
[12396.84s -> 12409.61s]  in the world is like Barefeet wine or something, isn't it? Listen, I'm trying to say that, uh,
[12409.61s -> 12415.32s]  but if they don't, I was trying to say the big like corporate wine companies aren't like
[12415.32s -> 12424.09s]  Barefeet wines, but there it is. I'll take the, Barefoot wine. Wines. I lose. I lose. Sometimes
[12424.09s -> 12430.55s]  you lose. Sometimes you lose. I'm going to lose. I take a loss. I'll lose this one. I'll lose it.
[12430.55s -> 12445.13s]  Yep. I lose. That's a loss. I hate, I don't like losing. I lose. I don't want, I hate losing. All
[12445.13s -> 12457.22s]  right. Fine. I lose. Fine. I lose. Oh, I fucking hate losing. Okay. Now stop feeding it to, all
[12457.22s -> 12465.02s]  right. I got to deposit this crap. Yes. Hold on. But wait, I'm getting backed up by a mob though.
[12466.04s -> 12475.40s]  It's not, it's called Barefoot wine, not Dave's Barefeet wine. That it's, there is a semantic
[12475.40s -> 12491.37s]  difference here. Yes. There's a difference. Dave's, Dave's Barefeet wine versus Barefoot wine. One is
[12491.37s -> 12498.22s]  implying that Dave's Barefeet were in this drink. And the other one is like, oh, Barefoot everywhere
[12498.22s -> 12504.66s]  on the beach. Maybe we're, I don't know, relaxing at home or I don't know. You know what I'm saying?
[12504.66s -> 12530.36s]  There's a different, there's a different context. Dude, you're weird. All right. All right. Let's go
[12530.36s -> 12544.90s]  feed the big guy. Wait, hold on. I got to answer this. Somebody said really important. Oh fuck. I
[12544.90s -> 12549.21s]  missed it. Somebody said this is really important for context. Remember this will make or break the
[12549.21s -> 12555.21s]  argument. Okay. Does the packaging look homemade and does Dave have his picture on the box?
[12555.69s -> 12590.57s]  Um, come on, you have to give me some credit. Yes. I love this car. It's so stupid. I'm not buying it.
[12590.57s -> 12596.12s]  That's worse. No, but it's, it's not that it's worse. It's okay. Let me make some money.
[12598.28s -> 12607.69s]  But is it just his face? Okay. Is it Dave going like this? Does Dave have a big beard? Okay. Does
[12607.69s -> 12619.46s]  Dave have a huge beard? I feel like it'd be Dave going like, and he's got a huge beard. Then like,
[12619.46s -> 12625.13s]  okay, that's just Dave. And like, maybe that means like Dave is, I don't know, likes to be barefoot
[12625.13s -> 12636.52s]  and whatever on the beach or whatever. No, it's just, it's his, it's his bare feet. Then no,
[12636.52s -> 12642.22s]  then absolutely not. I don't want it. You guys are distracting the fuck out of me right now.
[12656.31s -> 12660.39s]  Guys, no one would do this with their marketing. No one would be like, Hey, I have an idea.
[12660.39s -> 12664.07s]  I'm going to make a wine and it's going to be called Dave's Barefeet Wine. And oh, by the way,
[12664.07s -> 12667.91s]  let me remind people that it's my bare feet that is crushing the grapes. And I'm going to put my
[12667.91s -> 12674.26s]  feet on the picture on the packaging. No marketing 101 would be like, um, I don't know if you,
[12674.26s -> 12693.00s]  I don't, I don't think we do that. Somebody typed this. I need to find out if it's for real.
[12693.00s -> 12702.23s]  Barefoot's creator, his first wine he made in his garage. It was called Barefoot Burgundy. What?
[12703.93s -> 12722.95s]  It's true. It can't be. Barefoot Wine. Was somebody named Davis? No, it was not. Wow. That's
[12722.95s -> 12738.63s]  unfucking believable. Take our very beginnings. California winemaker, Davis first created Barefoot
[12738.63s -> 12744.15s]  Burgundy in his garage. The unconventional name referred to what else? The free spirited method
[12744.15s -> 12761.19s]  of crushing grapes barefoot. Fast forward. Here we are today. His name was Davis. Wow. Oh, this is an
[12761.19s -> 12768.65s]  Omega loss that I'm taking here. This is like a huge L. You just watched me get absolutely eviscerated
[12768.65s -> 12779.48s]  on stream. Has that happened before? Have I ever been this eviscerated on camera? I don't think so.
[12780.28s -> 12783.88s]  This is an absolute complete and total incorrect statement. I've been making this whole time.
[12785.34s -> 12803.35s]  Wow. We told you now last week you were wrong about goat cheese too. I stand by that.
[12805.46s -> 12811.37s]  Apologize. I apologize for having no, I'm not apologizing because I don't, I don't know. I,
[12811.45s -> 12824.87s]  I don't know. Are you going to? No. Okay. Let's play Slime Rancher. I took the L. I lose. Um,
[12825.91s -> 12839.38s]  it was Barefoot Wine. Oh, what a loss. Okay. I got some fruits and vegetables. We're going
[12839.38s -> 12858.20s]  to go check out our buddy up here. But what if it was called like Davis like fart bread
[12858.20s -> 12866.18s]  or Dave's like fart wine? Would you still, would you drink it? Dave's saying like I farted. I farted
[12866.18s -> 12871.54s]  in the, okay, hold on. I farted in the room this was made in was like in quotes on the,
[12872.54s -> 12881.10s]  right on the, on the label. Would you drink it? It's just like, I farted in the room where this
[12881.10s -> 12890.86s]  was made. It's probably time to cease, Jerma. This is reaching now. Wow. This is, you're reaching
[12890.86s -> 12901.98s]  hard. All right. The mods are telling me to stop. Is this reaching? Yeah, this is reaching pretty
[12901.98s -> 12909.69s]  hard, I think. No, you can keep going, dude. Sorry. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[12909.69s -> 12918.17s]  no, no, no, no. Don't, don't, don't 180 on me. Rain me in here. You can go. Pepe laugh. Do what
[12918.17s -> 12934.94s]  you want. Pepe laugh. Is that a no? Oh, all right. Where, where, where are you? Where's the big slime?
[12934.94s -> 12959.30s]  Where's the big slime? Where's the big slime? It's in a cave. Oh, oh, it's down here. Okay.
[12959.30s -> 12998.92s]  This is fruits. Ooh. Okay. So now we're under here. Watered yet? Um, this is a certain port.
[13023.80s -> 13049.34s]  Okay. Can I put this in here? No. Is this a cat? I think that's a cat. Okay. So we've got to come
[13049.34s -> 13054.78s]  back down here and that's a cat slime. I think does it count if I take one of the,
[13054.78s -> 13066.82s]  I think that counts, right? I do want to go to the, okay, this one over here because that's
[13066.82s -> 13117.34s]  the vegetable one, right? Come on, dude. All right. The other one is over here. Ooh.
[13118.46s -> 13184.76s]  Large pink bonza. More? There we go. All right. What do you got? What, carrots?
[13184.76s -> 13219.59s]  I feel like I just blew up that town in Fallout 3. Um, what does that do? Oh,
[13220.31s -> 13226.23s]  you look at that. Okay. All right. I got to go back and deposit and then I'm going that way.
[13226.23s -> 13278.07s]  Nice. Unlock. What are these? Like, what are these things you're pulling out here?
[13278.07s -> 13284.62s]  At 24 minutes and 20 seconds in the second German video, L.A. Noire, the German craft killer.
[13284.62s -> 13306.87s]  All right. Detective Andy. He holds up a bottle of barefoot wine to the camera. Okay. I'm not,
[13306.87s -> 13360.10s]  I can't drink it. Why can't I drink it? It's literally the thumbnail. All right. I got to,
[13360.10s -> 13376.90s]  there's a lot of money to be made here. I got to feed a lot of people. Hold on.
[13376.98s -> 13421.11s]  Dave's bread. Dave's bread is great. Okay. It's time to do a huge turn in here very soon.
[13421.11s -> 13436.81s]  This is going to be a lot of money. This is going to be more money than I know what to do with.
[13436.81s -> 13464.70s]  Look at this. Uh, how many of these do I need? The, that door. Just one? Just one? Cool.
[13464.70s -> 13486.22s]  I don't know. You're hungry. How are you? Hold on. I'll feed them.
[13523.21s -> 13534.17s]  Any more? I think we're good. Maybe we'll be at five grand. It's overflowing.
[13534.17s -> 13573.21s]  Make sure to save a tabby plort. Yep. 4200 bucks. What can I do? All right. Pink plorts
[13573.21s -> 13585.02s]  is more health. I still need the ore. I don't have any. Yeah. Okay. I have enough jelly stones.
[13585.02s -> 13599.22s]  Um, I don't think I can do anything. Very cool. It's time. Dude, I just banked the money. I don't
[13599.22s -> 13611.48s]  need it. What about tomatoes? I don't really need to give my tomato opinion again. I feel like it
[13611.48s -> 13625.00s]  been pretty clear about it. All right. I need a tabby plort.
[13635.42s -> 13659.06s]  Is this thing fully upgraded? I'm just going to buy it. Is everything fully upgraded? Uh,
[13659.06s -> 13681.58s]  this pen over here could use it. I need another slime. All right. This thing's ready. Do you
[13681.58s -> 13689.32s]  prefer a fast food place to wrap your burger in paper or foil? Paper. Something about foil.
[13689.32s -> 13692.20s]  I feel like I'm going to accidentally eat a piece and it's like, I just ate metal.
[13692.92s -> 13721.37s]  Monka S. If I eat some paper, I don't care. Boil will keep it warm. Boil makes it feel premium.
[13725.24s -> 13744.07s]  I didn't think about that. That's kind of true. That makes sense. Keeps it warm. Time to go open
[13744.07s -> 13759.58s]  that thing. Burger or burrito. Uh, okay. Let me, let me backtrack a little. Burger or taco.
[13759.58s -> 13766.95s]  That's harder. Burger or burrito. It's burger every time. Uh, I don't dislike burritos. I just,
[13766.95s -> 13773.77s]  burgers are better in my brain, but burger versus taco. That's actually very hard for me
[13773.77s -> 13778.28s]  because I don't think I could answer that. I really don't. All right. So it's down here.
[13778.28s -> 13805.45s]  Burritos have a tendency to get really messy. What about tacos? All right. But okay. How do
[13805.45s -> 13816.26s]  I word this? A taco is usually small, very small. And I can, I get through a taco and I'm like,
[13816.26s -> 13823.99s]  all right, cool. Did I got two more tacos? Sure. I, yeah, I'll take another taco. That sounds great.
[13823.99s -> 13834.79s]  But a burrito, burrito, unfortunately, is huge. They're usually big and stuffed full of stuff.
[13834.79s -> 13838.95s]  So you get, sometimes you might get halfway through burrito and it's just like, I don't
[13838.95s -> 13844.87s]  really want the rest of this. Tacos, you can kind of portion out what you want. Where a burrito,
[13844.87s -> 13852.47s]  a big burrito especially, you're committed here. You could wrap it back up and put it in the fridge,
[13852.47s -> 13864.46s]  but I don't know. I'd rather just eat what I want. And plus the street taco is sort of, I mean,
[13864.46s -> 13871.34s]  if you have the soft shell, kind of soft street taco, it kind of is a burrito. It's just a small
[13871.34s -> 13876.95s]  one. I don't like the big burrito. And things I don't, I like one thing, tacos to me, I like
[13876.95s -> 13882.63s]  because you've got the layers. It's meat, cheese. And then on top of the cheese is lettuce. And on
[13882.63s -> 13886.39s]  top of the lettuce is tomatoes, whatever, right? It's a layered experience and everything doesn't
[13886.39s -> 13894.26s]  kind of mush together. A burrito, everything gets mushed into this soup in the middle. And
[13895.05s -> 13901.74s]  I'm talking and everything turns into kind of this weird meat soup where it's just kind of
[13901.74s -> 13910.06s]  everything mushes together. I like it being kind of separated in the taco. Now, let me make,
[13910.06s -> 13919.82s]  I gotta make this really 100% clear. If you gave me a burrito right now and you said, hey, eat this,
[13919.82s -> 13930.02s]  it's a burrito. I'd go, yes, that sounds fucking incredible. It's not like an S tier versus D tier.
[13930.02s -> 13936.58s]  It's like an A plus tier versus A minus tier, if that makes any sense. So there you go. This
[13936.58s -> 13948.07s]  might take on burritos versus tacos. All right, where was that? Down here, right? Where's the
[13948.07s -> 13967.11s]  cave? I forgot where that cave was. I feel like it's right here somewhere, right? Where is it?
[13967.11s -> 13980.73s]  Can you guys help? It's over near the beach. Can you help? Thank you. I appreciate the help.
[13980.73s -> 13989.19s]  What about, what's your favorite Indian dish? I mean, butter chicken is just, you cannot, I can't,
[13989.27s -> 13997.66s]  it's just, it's just S tier. It's 10, 110 out of 10. How do I get out? How do I get, okay, I gotta
[13997.66s -> 14018.98s]  talk about, no more food. I need to find this cave. Wait, where was it? Like down here? No,
[14018.98s -> 14037.74s]  it wasn't at like here. I wish I could mark stuff. Was it up? Somebody help me. I genuinely don't
[14037.74s -> 14089.99s]  know. It was like a cave thing here somewhere down off the cliff. It wasn't over here somewhere.
[14089.99s -> 14095.02s]  The line on the map. No, no, no, no. I'm not looking for that. I'm looking for the place where
[14095.02s -> 14102.70s]  I can shoot this port. It was like up and then down and then I just honestly have no, I have,
[14102.70s -> 14122.06s]  I do not remember where it was. It's near the conservatory. Is it? Isn't it just like right
[14122.06s -> 14144.74s]  here? Yeah. All right. Here it is. Yeah. I was like, no, there's no way. There we go. Tank guard.
[14144.74s -> 14170.22s]  What is that? Pretty cool. All right. Now let's go to the next area down here. 37 year old
[14170.30s -> 14185.19s]  Jerma is whack. I turned 37 guys and now every stream is a crack stream. Have I ever had
[14185.19s -> 14208.04s]  octopus? I haven't. I don't like it. It creeps me out. It's a little weird for me. All right. So
[14208.04s -> 14228.46s]  from here, go. Even squid too. Squid kind of freaks me out too. Something about it. I really
[14228.46s -> 14236.86s]  don't want to ruin the calamari for anybody, but it looks very specifically like something
[14236.86s -> 14258.47s]  that I do not, I don't like. Here we go. Move. Although I do have a bunch of shit. Maybe I
[14258.47s -> 14267.02s]  should get rid of this. They look like spiders like lying on their backs with their legs in the
[14267.02s -> 14278.30s]  air dead. When you get like calamari where it's like, you know what I'm saying? They had the
[14278.30s -> 14299.38s]  legs. They're like this. What kind of 37 year old is afraid of calamari? I don't sit in the
[14299.38s -> 14303.86s]  restaurant and freak out when the calamari comes. Somebody orders calamari. I go, oh, all right,
[14303.86s -> 14310.28s]  cool. I'm not going to have any, but I hope you like it. It's not like the guy doesn't walk over
[14310.28s -> 14319.10s]  with the fajita plate like shh. And I'm just like, no, no, I have to leave. I'm fine. I don't
[14319.18s -> 14354.30s]  care. I might even eat one new zone. Let's go. I need a new slime and go. All right. I found
[14354.30s -> 14377.75s]  what I'm going to put. Let's make that sound. What did I miss it? I missed it. I didn't,
[14377.75s -> 14380.47s]  I didn't even know what I was supposed to be looking for. It looked like just a regular.
[14380.47s -> 14412.57s]  It looked like a cat slime beats. All right. It's just white. Okay. What do rocks eat?
[14412.57s -> 14449.13s]  Ed cheese. Really? You don't need meat. What has happened? That scared the shit out of me, man.
[14487.66s -> 14504.10s]  No, please make it. Oh my fucking God. What? What happened? What ever back? I'm gonna pee.
[14504.10s -> 14512.62s]  What the fuck? I, you die instantly and you lose everything. I was trying to bring it back.
[14512.62s -> 14611.70s]  Beer B fucking game is not even fun. Uh, I got a lot of cleanup to do though. I, so I was muted,
[14611.70s -> 14618.71s]  but, um, I might haven't cleaned my room in a while and I didn't clean my room. So I got to
[14618.71s -> 14670.49s]  clean my room. Um, so I, I'll, um, I'll be right back again. Okay. No. Why would I leave the mic
[14670.49s -> 14677.62s]  on and just smashing windows? All right. Um, all right. I'll actually be right back.
[14680.36s -> 14700.36s]  Modeling is a house. Oh man. I was muted. I was, I was dying over here. I just people like,
[14700.36s -> 14706.42s]  what is he doing? I was, if you look up smash controller sound effect, it's one of the first
[14706.42s -> 14716.38s]  two and this, this, whoever's doing this is really hitting it on something and it won't break.
[14716.94s -> 14993.59s]  It's not breaking. All right. BRB for real. Hello again. Okay. I think it's time to dial the, uh,
[14993.59s -> 15002.12s]  maybe a little bit of erratic stream behavior here. I think we're going to pull it back a little
[15002.12s -> 15014.02s]  and chill and relax the next part of the stream. Okay. Hey dude, can you reduce the bit rate of
[15014.02s -> 15024.30s]  the stream so I can finish downloading devil may cry five? Uh, just put it in one ADP or something.
[15024.30s -> 15038.49s]  You can do that. You can do that on your own. Put it in like 240 feet. All right. So what was
[15038.49s -> 15045.40s]  I doing? Right. Oh, I died. That's right. It's also funny that I'm not even using a controller.
[15045.40s -> 15051.94s]  Okay. Is there a way I can tell? I got to teleport. I have a teleporter. Don't I?
[15055.24s -> 15070.14s]  Do I have to buy it or unlock it? Cause I have access to this teleporting pod,
[15070.14s -> 15089.38s]  but do I have to actually make it? Oh, okay. I need 10. Perfect. I need 10, uh, bunny
[15089.38s -> 15093.70s]  ports and I'm good to go. Do I have any in here? No. All right. I can do it.
[15093.70s -> 15100.81s]  When you can play trombone champ. I don't know. Maybe whenever I stream next tomorrow,
[15100.81s -> 15114.70s]  the next day, I need just regular bunny ports
[15132.76s -> 15155.53s]  at more than 30. Damn. Okay. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.
[15157.88s -> 15178.07s]  I'm 38. You're not old. Thank you. That's a nice thing to say. Appreciate it.
[15186.18s -> 15194.33s]  All right. So we got to get this one loaded because eventually there's going to be
[15194.33s -> 15203.00s]  some buddy in here. Okay. First things first. I'm going to do a one pole here.
[15204.28s -> 15211.38s]  There's a lot of ports I need to collect. Very important.
[15214.23s -> 15266.86s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Now I need 10 of the cotton floors. Let's build it. So now I can
[15266.86s -> 15272.47s]  actually teleport. Um, and I'm not going to get stuck somewhere and not be able to go anywhere.
[15272.47s -> 15294.42s]  All right. Let's do it. Build it home portal one. Oh, one way travel back to the conservatory. It's
[15294.42s -> 15309.00s]  T. I need to build it here. This gadget is installed permanently until demolished. Should
[15309.00s -> 15316.87s]  I put it somewhere else? Oh, okay. Let me put it. Where should I put it? Can I put it pretty much
[15316.87s -> 15322.07s]  anywhere? I can. All right. I definitely want it next to the house. Yeah. Without a doubt.
[15327.00s -> 15344.33s]  Right next to the house. Very cool. Okay. So this brings me. What did I, what just happened? What
[15344.33s -> 15365.91s]  the hell just happened? Don't I, how do I, it's a one way home portal, but how do I use it to go
[15365.91s -> 15387.34s]  back? I wasted it. It's one way. Yeah. But it's not like a town portal in Diablo where like, oh,
[15387.34s -> 15393.27s]  I'm going to leave and I go back to that. I have to build. Okay. All right. All right. Let me,
[15393.27s -> 15413.27s]  let me make sure I get this right. So I want to go here. Let's go one way to your home.
[15413.27s -> 15419.86s]  Fuck. I thought it meant like I could, I thought it was a permanent thing that just stayed there.
[15419.86s -> 15433.66s]  It's what can I take it back? You build it in the wilderness for a quick trip home. Yeah. But I
[15433.66s -> 15439.74s]  thought it was a permanent fixture here and I had like a town portal scroll that I clicked on or so.
[15439.74s -> 15466.41s]  So what the fuck is the point of that? I just wasted all those resources too. Didn't I?
[15466.41s -> 15485.26s]  How do I remove it? I get it back. I don't get it back. I don't fucking get it back. Well,
[15485.26s -> 15492.87s]  when I built it down here, it was like, Oh, I had to build it here. I had to build one of these down
[15492.87s -> 15495.99s]  here. And then it was like, Oh, make sure to go into gadget mode and put it down. I didn't know
[15495.99s -> 15501.38s]  it was, that's how it worked. I thought it was like a permanent like teleporter upgrade for the
[15501.38s -> 15528.15s]  wait. Why can I, I can still do it. I think I'm fine. I'm fine. I can still do it. I can still do
[15528.15s -> 15581.50s]  it. Yeah, we're good. All right. I want to go get some slimes here. Free food. Okay. Let's go. Now
[15583.19s -> 15589.51s]  let me get my stuff that I want to get. They were beats. They were, there was new slimes.
[15589.51s -> 15625.75s]  There was a rock slime. It was a, it was a stealth assassin slime. Let's not blow it please. All
[15625.75s -> 15645.99s]  right. There we go. Yep. There we go. Oh, you're too big. But I did get one of the, one of the
[15645.99s -> 15683.37s]  plorts. I can use that. Okay. Let me find just a little small version. What's going on over there?
[15683.37s -> 15716.15s]  Is that a beehive? Oh shit. Wild honey. All right. I'll take it. Honey slime. Oh hell yeah. Let's go.
[15725.03s -> 15757.62s]  Get the fuck away from me. I don't know what that is, but I kind of want it. Oh, I don't,
[15757.62s -> 15777.85s]  maybe I could get one. What do they eat? Veggies, right? I just want a blue one to eat a vegetable.
[15777.85s -> 15790.50s]  What is that thing? Look at this weird apple. Mint mango? Shit. Um, I think it's important to
[15790.50s -> 15802.41s]  have this. I'm not going back yet. I want some more rocks and some more. I think the wild honey
[15802.41s -> 15817.72s]  back too. Whoa. Angler slime. That's too much. That's too much shit. Look at all this stuff.
[15817.72s -> 15827.61s]  So I don't have it. I need a bigger inventory. Okay. I have to go back. I want a bigger inventory.
[15828.09s -> 15832.68s]  Let me see if I can find some more of these.
[15838.95s -> 15844.49s]  My whole life just flashed before my eyes. I can't believe I shit my pants in the fucking second
[15844.49s -> 15905.50s]  grade. Jesus. What is that? How do I get the first two? All right. It's time to go before I die.
[15905.50s -> 15931.50s]  What is that? Oh, this is, I need this ore. Oh God damn it. Um, all right. I know what this is though.
[15968.18s -> 15988.46s]  What was this? No, no, no. I don't want that. Buzz wax? No, you're more important. Kubrick's stare.
[15988.54s -> 16013.78s]  How do I get more slots in my backpack? I have to upgrade it. Is it even on the list of things
[16013.78s -> 16052.46s]  to upgrade? It was. I didn't even see it. Backpack size, not capacity. Okay. I wonder what it needs.
[16052.46s -> 16077.24s]  Okay. For a second, I thought everybody died in here. They didn't. That's just, there was
[16077.24s -> 16081.99s]  nothing in there to begin with. All right. So what are these guys like? Is it fruits? No,
[16081.99s -> 16089.30s]  they like vegetables. What about the honey slimes? Oh, you like fruits. Well, go on in.
[16089.30s -> 16097.06s]  This is ready for you. It's going to be delicious. Tons of plorts. It's going to be sick.
[16100.42s -> 16114.97s]  I believe it is time. I think it's time to retire bunnies maybe. Yep. Either that or I need a new
[16116.09s -> 16144.95s]  plort thingy. Let me just put this here. And these, they want vegetables. All right. So we
[16144.95s -> 16158.09s]  got fruits, veggies, a lot of veggies. All right. Let's go. I think I'll make another garden too.
[16158.89s -> 16184.54s]  Yeah. I mean, I need some more vegetables. Okay. Cool. So it's, do you guys like fruit?
[16184.54s -> 16202.31s]  Let's fill this other one with fruit. Veggies going here. I got you guys. This is probably
[16202.31s -> 16208.07s]  one of the last times I feed the, maybe not. I don't know. What should I do?
[16217.00s -> 16239.00s]  Clear some of the hens out. All right. Don't retire any. Keep them all. Yeah. I mean,
[16239.00s -> 16243.56s]  but they're not going to be worth, the plorts aren't worth anything. And if I have to keep
[16243.56s -> 16263.38s]  feeding a dozen of these, I feel like I'm going to waste food. Okay. So what do I want to make?
[16264.02s -> 16278.12s]  I still have this, is this got a pond one? Deposit this shit. Hold on. All right. What is,
[16278.12s -> 16288.31s]  what is this thing you talking about? Tank booster, 30 units, extra tank. So this is it here.
[16288.79s -> 16320.34s]  I don't have any sand. Well, let's do this. I'm going to store 30 in here, maybe more
[16320.98s -> 16325.14s]  because I, you want at least 10 to 20 of every single plort, right? Just in case
[16342.65s -> 16356.73s]  100 of every plort. Okay. I have so much shit here. All right. Um,
[16356.73s -> 16381.02s]  um, honey rocks, maybe. Oh, you eat meat. Perfect. Uh, you're going to be in your own pen.
[16381.02s -> 16406.95s]  Is there any more pens? You need water for the angler slime? Maybe it's a pond. Um, well,
[16406.95s -> 16434.17s]  I have some more room down here. All right. I think it's a pond. Is this correct? You look
[16434.17s -> 16447.37s]  pretty happy in there. You look kind of happy, right? Are you trying to get out? I don't think
[16447.37s -> 16515.67s]  so. Right. Eat this. Nice. Nice. Should I feed you a rock or something? Let him out. How much
[16515.67s -> 16520.39s]  do the honey ones go for? All right. I got to start. Let's go. I'll keep getting distracted
[16520.39s -> 16558.26s]  and overwhelmed. Um, I need so much more room. Blood on the floor of that cage. Okay. You're
[16558.26s -> 16580.22s]  happy. You're kind of unhappy, but we're okay. Kind of, I think. Okay. Yikes. Okay. I need to
[16580.22s -> 16585.58s]  feed this to somebody. Who should I even? I think I'm going to feed it to you.
[16585.58s -> 16596.49s]  One of you guys in here. Just fuck it. Go for it. All right. Yeah. You eat meat and vegetables. All
[16596.49s -> 16611.21s]  right. Cool. Maybe I should turn, turn them into rock ones. That might be smart. Should I do rock,
[16611.21s -> 16623.69s]  uh, phosphorus or rock? Um, honey, honey, phosphorus, honey, phosphorus. That's what
[16623.69s -> 16635.27s]  I was thinking. All right. Well, there's a shit load over here, so let's do it.
[16636.92s -> 16668.02s]  All right. It's time for you to grow up. Cool. So they eat fruit. Good to know. They're too big.
[16668.02s -> 16706.01s]  I think they're okay. All right. What about rock honey? Rock honey? They might break out. They're
[16706.01s -> 16727.50s]  not going to break out. Okay. Fruit. Let's go back to what I was doing. These are worth 58 each. Uh,
[16727.50s -> 16742.38s]  yes, please. Thank you. So you guys are good. I need fruits. I have a lot of fruit over here.
[16746.70s -> 16765.72s]  Okay. Um,
[16796.79s -> 16804.62s]  overstimulation. No, I'm all right. This is veggies and I obviously want lots of rock stuff.
[16805.18s -> 16824.12s]  Yes. You know what? Just kind of keep it in there. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.
[16841.96s -> 16847.99s]  All right. Cool.
[16850.79s -> 16863.93s]  All right. Cool. How you guys doing? What do you guys eat? Fruits? Yeah. All right. I'm coming.
[16863.93s -> 16884.90s]  I'm coming. Cool. I'm coming. Fuck. Um, hold on. 33. That's all right. He's never cleaned any of
[16884.90s -> 16926.17s]  these cells. Let's go do this. Um, I think I'm going to remove some of the phosphorus ones.
[16926.89s -> 16942.57s]  They, it's going to get too, it's going to get too wild in here. It's going to, it's going to get
[16942.57s -> 16955.53s]  actually unreasonable in here. Okay. I think that's all right. Maybe like two or three more.
[16956.33s -> 16991.42s]  That's enough. Why are there veggies in here? All right. Go be free. They're fine. They're fine.
[16991.42s -> 17003.64s]  They're fine. They're fine. Oh shit. Box box raid. What's up box box. Uh, welcome everybody. How are
[17003.64s -> 17012.41s]  you playing some slime ranch or two? I think I'm doing a pretty good job. Hope you had a good, uh,
[17012.41s -> 17025.74s]  stream box box. I've got a lot of, uh, stuff going on. Trying to make some money. I'm doing
[17025.74s -> 17040.39s]  all right so far. Things are going good. Where'd all this energy come from? I'm saying hello. I'm
[17040.39s -> 17057.19s]  welcoming a bunch of people that just got here. What was that? It was okay. I'm going to show you
[17057.19s -> 17063.56s]  this one day. The ring light is right here. So when I look up here, it's kind of really
[17063.56s -> 17086.73s]  bright in my face. So I can't really look into the camera because it's so bright. Okay. I have
[17086.73s -> 17102.90s]  almost a hundred of these phosphorus. I think I'm ready to leave. I think I'm ready to continue
[17102.90s -> 17116.09s]  what I was doing. Right? Let it just collect. I want to go get one of those, um, assassin raccoon
[17116.09s -> 17154.30s]  things. Let me fill up some of the wrong side. All right. Let's go. The inventory upgrade.
[17154.30s -> 17159.34s]  Thank you for reminding. Thank you. Seriously. I actually would have just completely just,
[17159.34s -> 17182.10s]  just glossed over that. What do I need? What was it again? Someone fed the AI thing,
[17182.10s -> 17186.34s]  the image of the stream, but erased just your face so it would auto-complete.
[17192.70s -> 17235.34s]  This is fucking hilarious. You ready? That's insane. There's another one. This one, I don't get it,
[17235.34s -> 17269.93s]  but I do. I want this as an emote or something. This picture is so perfect. What's the, uh,
[17270.65s -> 17303.91s]  the Pennywise actor? What was his name? Yeah. Bill Skarsgård. Bill Skarsgård. So ridiculous.
[17303.91s -> 17311.70s]  It's ridiculous. It really is. Okay. But the real question is how many yellow plorts did I need?
[17311.70s -> 17326.18s]  How could there only have been one elder chicken? It was 10, right? Okay. So hold on. I got to take...
[17331.46s -> 17350.89s]  It's 10 rock ports, not yellow. Is it?
[17350.89s -> 17370.42s]  Is it really rock ports?
[17378.74s -> 17409.42s]  Shit. All right. What do they eat? Veggies? Fuck. I need veggies. Hurry. I'm going to bed. So I wake
[17409.42s -> 17441.91s]  up and it'll be there. This is a long time to be asleep. Okay. Let's do this now. Oh, something in
[17441.91s -> 17449.06s]  my eye. You get something in your eye and it just doesn't stop for like an hour. It's annoying.
[17450.78s -> 17482.36s]  Okay. Excellent. You guys need to eat too. Uh, shit. Hold on. I'll be right back. Hold on. I'll be
[17482.36s -> 17494.79s]  back. I'm back. End of the stream, boys? Um, not, not yet. Maybe in a little bit. So what does it
[17494.79s -> 17512.31s]  take? Silky. Oh, I don't even have the sand for this. Or distort. Let me feed everybody again.
[17512.31s -> 17525.38s]  I got a lot of people to feed here. You ever played the first game? Yeah. I, uh, I beat the
[17525.38s -> 17570.62s]  first game on stream, didn't I? I remember correctly. You guys eat fruit. You need veggies
[17570.62s -> 17601.61s]  or meat. I can do that. You guys want fruit. Chickens. Come here. I'm going to be overflowing
[17601.61s -> 17633.78s]  with these. Oh, the angler. I'm just going to bring the angler up here. He hates us. He's not
[17633.78s -> 17706.63s]  reading chat. What are you on about? All right. Store it. All right. Cool. Let me go get the
[17707.66s -> 17715.93s]  other slime that's down here. I'm going to bring them out. I'm going to put them in that, uh, with
[17715.93s -> 17722.30s]  the other rocks and feed it a rock. I think that's a great idea. And what's, do you hear my voice
[17722.30s -> 17730.18s]  right now? I don't know what, I don't know why this is happening, but it is. Hey, come with me.
[17730.26s -> 17751.70s]  And then I'm going to feed a rock to this. It makes the most logical sense, I believe.
[17755.16s -> 17760.44s]  Go ahead and eat one. I guess I'll pull it if it's not. All right. We need, um, did you eat one?
[17761.24s -> 17774.58s]  All right. There we go. Perfect. Perfect. Let's go. It's time to continue. I think everyone's fine.
[17774.58s -> 17785.86s]  I could refill some fruit. He's not ready yet. Nope. Not quite. All right. All right. I'm going
[17785.86s -> 17811.69s]  now. I need to find sand. I'm going this way. The inventory slots. I need sand. I need what,
[17811.69s -> 17823.58s]  like silky sand or something, which I don't have. Is it, maybe it's on a beach. Could NPCs have
[17823.58s -> 17858.33s]  feelings if they're programmed to? Oh, a thinking face. Let's go. Stop at Wendy's on your way back.
[17858.33s -> 17865.53s]  You know, that's actually not a bad idea. Oh, somebody said food. That means streams ending
[17865.53s -> 17873.10s]  in like 30 minutes. Actually true though. Didn't I tell you guys, like, if you want,
[17873.10s -> 17877.10s]  if you want a stream to turn off, just talk about food after like seven or eight o'clock Pacific.
[17877.10s -> 17891.86s]  That's the quickest way for me to be like, oh yeah, food, eating humans. I eat. I need that.
[17891.86s -> 17913.27s]  I want the beat. I'm looking for, I guess I can take more rocks. That's fine. I do want the
[17913.27s -> 17931.62s]  recommend though. Do you recommend eating any of these? I don't think they're edible. Not, not,
[17931.62s -> 17940.30s]  not the humans though. I don't think, not the humans at least. You can play breath of the
[17940.30s -> 17969.91s]  wild tomorrow. Yes. I want to bring this guy back. Jesus. I still have not found the map
[17969.91s -> 17999.72s]  fragment thing here. Just kind of surprising to break these or something. Oh, no, I don't want
[17999.72s -> 18034.65s]  the honey. Okay. Ooh, meat. I have so many chickens. What's better, Greek or Italian food?
[18034.65s -> 18044.10s]  Uh, that is very hard. Depends on the day. I want to say Italian because Italian, it's just
[18044.10s -> 18068.01s]  chicken parm or, you know, you know what I'm saying? No, I'll, I'll joke aside. Italian
[18068.01s -> 18073.34s]  food is like one of my favorite. Uh, Mexican, Italian and Greek are probably one, two and three.
[18073.34s -> 18081.96s]  Probably in that order as well. I'm a sucker for American food too though. Just like that,
[18081.96s -> 18088.62s]  hot dogs, hamburgers, turkey sandwiches. Just like the, the, whoa, give me a bunch of these.
[18089.26s -> 18099.42s]  Is that that like a barbecue? Brisket's one of my favorite things in the world.
[18099.42s -> 18122.57s]  Um, I mean that's kind of style. I like a lot of different things. I really do. Good old-fashioned
[18122.57s -> 18138.25s]  American food. Yeah. Well, I'm going to have a ton of these now. They're going to need their own,
[18138.33s -> 18163.45s]  uh, they're going to need their own pen. 24? That's a lot. French fries? Well, they're actually not
[18163.45s -> 18171.78s]  called French fries, right? Aren't they just called, aren't they called crisps? No. Oh man,
[18171.78s -> 18182.92s]  I got that wrong. What, what is it? It's chips, right? Chips are fries. Crisps are chips, right?
[18182.92s -> 18188.34s]  Yeah, so it's not French fries. They're, they're chips. Isn't that what a lot of EU calls French
[18188.34s -> 18201.14s]  fries? Oh, another L. Oh, another L. That's British. Fries are French. So what do, okay,
[18201.14s -> 18213.64s]  if you're from France, what do you call French fries? What are they called? Chips? Frites?
[18213.64s -> 18235.11s]  Just fries. Frites. Okay. Yeah. So I need this. I'm just going to farm over here for a
[18235.11s -> 18243.50s]  sec because I, I need this. Silky sand is over here on the beach. I need 10 of them.
[18243.50s -> 18275.90s]  Come on. How can there not be any? Any. Oh my God. Hey, what'd you do with my stuff?
[18275.90s -> 18307.66s]  What did my, where's my silky sand go? I just lost all of it. Oh my God. Get out of the way.
[18307.66s -> 18337.27s]  Sand? Don't jump that. I'm an idiot. I need a lot more than this.
[18357.29s -> 18371.10s]  I'm trying to think of some other foods that I like. I just like sat there. It was silent. I
[18371.10s -> 18379.11s]  just was, I just was in my own world for at least a full minute. I was gone. I was not even sitting
[18379.11s -> 18386.42s]  here. I was in my own head thinking about how good brisket was. I was like, oh yeah, brisket. Man,
[18386.42s -> 18409.18s]  that's good shit. And I forgot I was playing. I was just sitting here. Meat brain. Yeah. A good
[18409.18s -> 18417.00s]  brisket is you do the food dancing. No, I don't even know why I'm telling you guys this. Whenever
[18417.00s -> 18426.86s]  I eat something I like that I really like, I just kind of start going like, I just start punching
[18426.86s -> 18437.37s]  the air. I'm kind of just like, does anybody else do that? If it's really good. And I'm like,
[18437.37s -> 18451.21s]  oh, this is awesome. Yeah. I feel like other people do that. Stop shooting the fucking sand.
[18452.01s -> 18472.41s]  I think my body just gets bored. That's the problem. My mind is focusing so hard on how much
[18472.41s -> 18475.77s]  I like the thing that my body's like, Hey, how come I'm not involved? Why am I not involved?
[18475.77s -> 18486.17s]  The mind is having a good time. Let's throw some punches. I only, I still only have three
[18486.17s -> 18512.78s]  sand. It's bullshit. I think like over here, right? I'll give me this like another two minutes.
[18514.98s -> 18536.25s]  I can't replicate it or anything, right? There's no sand at this beach. How can there be no sand
[18536.25s -> 18570.62s]  on this beach? I think I'm ready to go back. There we go. Let's get the, how do I get up there?
[18570.62s -> 18576.01s]  Sand comes from the mud. Geyser is on the ground. Really? Okay. I thought they've just scattered
[18576.01s -> 18621.43s]  around randomly. How do I get up here? Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,
[18621.43s -> 18639.64s]  stop. I want, I want, um, thank God. All right. Nice. Now I have, all right. Good. I haven't been
[18639.64s -> 18656.74s]  up here yet. Have I been up here? Yeah. I was earlier. I don't know. I'm going back. I have,
[18656.74s -> 18662.20s]  I can't get rid of any of this stuff. So I'm just going to get out of here. Tons of new slime. So
[18662.20s -> 18679.98s]  have I not found the map? What's your favorite Mexican dish? I can't answer that. I actually
[18679.98s -> 18694.70s]  can't answer that question. Some days I just feel like a wet burrito, just a wet burrito and eat it
[18694.70s -> 18713.66s]  with a fork and knife. Um, I love tacos. I love, I love everything. Yeah. Soggy, wet burrito,
[18713.66s -> 18719.00s]  just covered in the sauce. And you just like, you eat it. It's like a stew almost sometimes.
[18719.72s -> 18745.80s]  Favorite frozen pizza? It used to be Dr. Oakhurst, but you can't really find it anymore
[18745.80s -> 18758.31s]  the last few years. Where would you place plain cottage cheese on a tier list? Um, it can't be
[18758.31s -> 18766.15s]  plain. I would say cottage cheese with salt and pepper is, it's pretty high. I think a lot of
[18766.15s -> 18771.45s]  people sleep on cottage cheese. It's really good for you. It has a lot of nutrients, very dense.
[18771.45s -> 18782.98s]  It's really good, but you have to put salt and pepper on it. Salt and pepper. And that's it.
[18782.98s -> 18793.14s]  Just eat it like that. Just pepper. Pepper and cottage cheese need to be together. I don't like
[18793.14s -> 18800.71s]  cottage cheese. If anyone puts anything with sweetness or anything, no, no, no. All right.
[18800.71s -> 18810.42s]  I need another pen. I have so many of these and I'll do this and maybe, I don't know. Cottage
[18810.42s -> 18815.06s]  cheese is with sweet stuff like apples. Um, I, I prefer it with just pepper on it. Just salt and
[18815.14s -> 18825.45s]  pepper. No fruit. Nope. Salt and pepper. You already have the anglers with rock. Yeah,
[18825.45s -> 18832.90s]  but I think I want to do anglers and something else. Anglers and, uh, uh, ringtail. That'd be
[18832.90s -> 18843.83s]  cool. So let me go to the pen that I made down here. Hold on. Where is it? How am I even going
[18843.83s -> 18853.75s]  anymore? Cottage cheese and parmesan is good. I've never had that, but I had a doctor, not Dr.
[18853.75s -> 18861.86s]  Oakhurst. I had, what the hell, DiGiorno's, DiGiorno's stuffed cross pepperoni pizza.
[18861.86s -> 18886.06s]  That's very high. It's, it's exceptionally high. You guys hang out there for now. Um,
[18886.38s -> 18905.80s]  I guess I'll do another one over here. Should I not be putting the solar shield on everything?
[18905.80s -> 18926.89s]  I feel like I shouldn't be. They eat meat. Oh shit. The chickens. I put them in the wrong spot. Um,
[18926.89s -> 18959.11s]  okay. Uh, hold on. I'm going to transfer them here. Okay. I got to hold on. I'm going to do
[18959.11s -> 18981.51s]  a huge chicken transfer. Yeah. DiGiorno's stuffed crust pizzas. Phenomenal. Uh, the red Baron French
[18981.51s -> 18991.99s]  bread pizzas. That's like a high nine. All right. Now we can clean this out a little bit. That's
[18991.99s -> 19005.56s]  better. All right. Very good. Let's go dump all these in the other one. You've never had a French
[19005.56s -> 19013.83s]  bread pizza. Oh, it's so good. It's so good. That red Baron Supreme French bread pizza from the other
[19013.83s -> 19022.68s]  night. Jesus. That was, that was, that was close to a 10. That was like a 9.5. It was unbelievably
[19022.68s -> 19048.09s]  good. Where's the audio? All right. I got food. Maybe a little bit more. Those are going to be
[19048.09s -> 19064.71s]  worth a lot too. Those plorts. Do you guys eat meat, fruits? All right. Well here, eat these.
[19064.71s -> 19078.92s]  You guys good? Okay. I need to kind of sneak in here and grab these.
[19089.37s -> 19110.50s]  Cool. I think I should do, these two are going to be worth a lot right now, right? I think I'm
[19110.50s -> 19128.62s]  just going to combine these. Why not? Is that a bad idea? Anyone disagree? I'm just going to do it.
[19128.62s -> 19143.26s]  Don't they need light protection? Um, I don't think they do. Okay. Let's just do that. Cool. Whoa.
[19144.42s -> 19168.94s]  What? That was cool. So when do they, um, when do they stop doing that? It's dead? Oh, it needs to
[19168.94s -> 19175.43s]  be nighttime. Oh shit. Okay. Oh fuck. All right. I'll be back. I'll be right back. I'll be right
[19175.43s -> 19191.48s]  back. Well, the reason why I want to combine them is because when I feed them, I'll get both
[19191.48s -> 19207.10s]  ports, which is a huge deal. How much are these angler ones worth? 50? Oh yeah. All right. I'll
[19207.10s -> 19218.20s]  feed everybody. Hold on. I want them to feed. Uh, Oh God. They've been eating in days or something.
[19218.20s -> 19263.45s]  This is bad. Okay. Oh yeah. Okay. Oh, they say these guys eat fruit, right? Yep. Okay. Now who
[19263.45s -> 19290.06s]  eats the vegetables? These guys? What do you guys eat? Vegetables? Shit. I just used them all. You
[19290.06s -> 19305.24s]  guys eat fruit? Okay. Time to make some money. Goodness. All right. All right. All right. All
[19305.24s -> 19326.04s]  right. Um, hold on. You eat chickens or something, right? You guys are good. 61. Oh my God. Okay.
[19328.52s -> 19359.24s]  Uh, shit. Okay. I've got a really big overload here. Fuck. There's so many things to collect.
[19359.24s -> 19381.94s]  Okay. He's getting overwhelmed by a kid's game. This is not, I'm not, I, I'm going to stop talking.
[19381.94s -> 19428.10s]  I'm going to store the rest of these. Okay. What else is over here? We have these. Cool. All right.
[19428.10s -> 19454.62s]  Everybody good. If I took you to a casino and I gave you a hundred thousand dollars, what would
[19454.62s -> 19460.89s]  be the best game to triple your money in an hour? Uh, I would say do not go in the casino. Uh, use
[19460.89s -> 19469.62s]  that money to start like a business or like invest in, you know, skills or education or something.
[19469.62s -> 19477.16s]  No, I would not take that to a casino. I would, I would, I would walk out of the casino with that
[19477.16s -> 19485.77s]  money. That's probably a bad idea. Now you want to drop 500 at the blackjack table, smoke a cigar,
[19485.77s -> 19490.01s]  have a fucking vodka pineapple. That's up to you. I don't think I would do more than that though.
[19499.18s -> 19516.73s]  Lame vodka pineapple is, um, it's that that's the drink.
[19518.65s -> 19524.25s]  Everybody sleeps on the vodka pineapple till they drink it and they go, wow. Okay. Never mind.
[19525.46s -> 19528.18s]  Every other thing I've ever had is like, why would I ever have it ever again?
[19532.18s -> 19534.98s]  It's smooth. It's loaded with vitamin C.
[19554.71s -> 19573.66s]  Not pineapples. I didn't, that's not what I said. All right. Sell it. All right.
[19573.66s -> 19582.36s]  I have 3,600 bucks. I can, I'm going to bring the, somebody needs fruit. Who wants it?
[19583.50s -> 19589.88s]  Does somebody need fruit? I'm very simple when it comes to alcohol. Incredibly simple.
[19591.62s -> 19597.86s]  I don't want any, I don't, I don't, I'm not into like the marshmallow toasted almond vodka. No,
[19597.86s -> 19602.06s]  no, no, no. Just, just give me, I just want a vodka pineapple, a vodka cranberry,
[19602.94s -> 19607.10s]  or just like two fingers of whiskey. Like I got one that I like. That's it.
[19609.98s -> 19633.69s]  I only drink like a few times every few months. There's a never-ending supply here. Okay. Um,
[19634.94s -> 19646.74s]  load the, load this. Don't sleep on 1800 coconut tequila. I haven't, I'm not really a big tequila
[19646.74s -> 19653.45s]  guy, but if I'm ever in the tequila mood, I'll definitely, I would definitely check it out.
[19654.17s -> 19666.42s]  All right. Everyone's good. Everyone's good. Everybody likes tequila. Um, I'm not a big, no,
[19666.66s -> 19683.00s]  not margaritas, no. If you could invent a cocktail that would be named after you, what would it be?
[19683.00s -> 19692.89s]  Uh, Blue Gatorade. One, one, one and a half ounces of vodka. Blue Gatorade. Um, Jolly Rancher.
[19693.53s -> 19720.57s]  On the bottom. Um, two Green Apple Jolly Ranchers. And hold on. No, but I'm kidding. Are you serious?
[19720.57s -> 19725.61s]  No, my favorite drink that would be named, would just be, this is, it would be called the, the,
[19727.00s -> 19736.15s]  just drink it. Just drink it. I just feel like just drink it. That's it. And it would just be,
[19736.15s -> 19741.00s]  oh, what do you got? I've just vodka and pineapple. Just drink it. It's good. Just sip on it. It's
[19741.00s -> 19763.45s]  good. You don't need anything special. Why am I holding 25 fruits? Are they getting out?
[19763.45s -> 19803.91s]  Don't listen to German 985. We suggest the German 985. 12 ounces of rum, 12 ounces,
[19803.91s -> 19807.27s]  monster energy drink, combined in shaker and strain into a cocktail glass. That's,
[19807.27s -> 19822.23s]  I would not drink that. I don't know. The whole energy drink and alcohol thing to me is just,
[19822.23s -> 19835.26s]  just headache fluid. Uh-uh. It's just, I just, I'm just going to get a headache.
[19835.26s -> 19859.22s]  I never got into that. Too headache-y. Red Bull vodka. Yeah, but no, nah, nah, not me. I'm not
[19859.22s -> 19877.16s]  into it. It just makes me feel fucking crazy. I just don't like it. Everybody good? I think
[19877.16s -> 19889.18s]  everybody's good. Favorite subway order? That's a Meatball Marinara Sub. Large, no bullshit.
[19890.87s -> 19895.69s]  Just a large 12 inch meatball sub with just regular ass provolone cheese on it.
[19895.69s -> 19906.76s]  Nothing else. Don't put anything else on it. That's it. That's the one thing that I like at
[19906.76s -> 19918.92s]  Subway for real. Subway meatballs are F. That's it. They're okay. I haven't had one in a long time.
[19929.99s -> 19936.62s]  Sandwich tier list. Look, if you guys get me that interesting tier list, I'll do them. But I don't
[19936.62s -> 19940.63s]  want somebody to be like, Oh, Hey dude, do a sandwich tier list. Use this one. And it's like
[19941.54s -> 19948.97s]  a JPG's of like two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, a ham and cheese, a meatball sub
[19948.97s -> 19953.72s]  and a steak. They got to be substantial and it has to be a lot on it. They got to be a lot of
[19953.72s -> 19959.13s]  variety. I got to do the, they got to be good. It has to be like a decent tier list.
[19967.05s -> 19976.78s]  All right. I'm going to feed the other over here one more time. I did a sandwich
[19976.78s -> 19987.26s]  tier. Yeah, I did one already. I think I've done pretty much all of them that you can do.
[19987.26s -> 19994.62s]  We're going to start reaching here. Yeah. Once we start reaching to, uh, what is Donald Duck's
[19994.62s -> 20024.74s]  favorite sandwiches tier list? You know that we're kind of past doing them anymore.
[20024.74s -> 20033.00s]  Sell this. That should do it for a little bit. Firehouse is solid. Firehouse is all right. It's
[20033.00s -> 20041.16s]  good. What's the, uh, the Turkey one? They have, uh, it's like a Turkey. I think it's called the
[20041.16s -> 20047.70s]  ladder. It's whatever the ladder is. It's like a Turkey and peppers or something. The engineer,
[20050.65s -> 20056.90s]  the hook and ladder. Yeah. What's that one? I think that's the one that I get.
[20056.90s -> 20067.50s]  It's Turkey and ham. Yeah. Whatever that one is, it's good. Firehouse is fine.
[20067.50s -> 20081.88s]  I don't have a problem. Firehouse is good. What slimes are those? These are, um, angler slimes
[20082.84s -> 20091.83s]  and I combined them with the tail ringtail slime. So now they are happy raccoon angler.
[20091.83s -> 20098.10s]  Well, they're very, they're very unhappy. It seems they're very angry with me. They want to attack.
[20098.10s -> 20116.10s]  It's okay though. They're cute. Yeah, they are. The person with the coffee pasta that ended like
[20116.10s -> 20128.87s]  40 minutes ago, dude, are you, do you have like 60,000 ping? That was just, it just came up again.
[20128.87s -> 20137.26s]  I look over and it's like 40 minutes have gone by and I see, oh, hey dude, I'm a big fan. But like
[20137.26s -> 20143.91s]  you cool ranch Dorito farts or something. It's like, man, we, we were over that already. Okay.
[20143.91s -> 20154.55s]  You're about, I'm drunk. Um, well, just relax, drink some water, stop drinking. Now you got,
[20154.55s -> 20160.63s]  I got to give you guys the strat here. The drinking strat, trust me, please listen to me.
[20162.33s -> 20170.84s]  Stop drinking after midnight. It's treated like gremlin shit. Stop drinking after like 1150.
[20171.77s -> 20178.70s]  No, don't drink anything else. You're done. Drink water for the rest of the night and you'll be,
[20178.70s -> 20184.95s]  you'll feel in the morning, you're going to feel way better. Do not sit there and stare at that
[20184.95s -> 20195.45s]  fucking 1245 AM shot. Yeah. Okay. Um, maybe not. Yeah. Nope. Put it down. Put it down.
[20195.45s -> 20203.14s]  Seriously. Put it down. That one AM shot of fucking Jack Daniels. Don't do it. You're not
[20203.14s -> 20205.46s]  going to want to do that. You're going to wake up in the morning. You're going to be like,
[20205.46s -> 20211.06s]  why the fuck did I do that? It was the shot of Jack. You're going to be able to rewind and go
[20211.06s -> 20217.54s]  the shot of Jack Daniels at 145 is what fucked me up bad and put me over the edge.
[20221.50s -> 20231.85s]  At about 1215, you should treat alcohol like you're a gremlin and just start doing,
[20231.85s -> 20238.90s]  start doing water. Cause no, what, what, what like happens at two o'clock in the morning?
[20239.78s -> 20255.80s]  Nothing. Fuck that. No, no, I don't know at like two, three plus AM it's no after midnight.
[20257.40s -> 20261.24s]  It's like the let's let's it's time to end the party here.
[20261.24s -> 20267.06s]  So if you're sitting there and it's like, you know, 1231 AM right now and it's like,
[20267.38s -> 20278.70s]  I'm on Pacific. So I don't know where you are, but 1230, one AM, no more. What happens at two AM?
[20278.70s -> 20286.52s]  I joined a stream and asked where the, wait, what with the nearest barbecue? I don't know.
[20286.52s -> 20298.25s]  I couldn't even read what he said. Drinking is for nighttime though. Yeah. You got a solid.
[20298.25s -> 20302.58s]  All right. If you, if you start, oh, I'm going to have some drinks tonight.
[20302.58s -> 20305.06s]  Maybe I'm going to go with some friends. What am I going to do? I'm going to go do something.
[20305.06s -> 20309.38s]  Right. There's been plenty of opportunity to do that. I do it. People come to Vegas a lot.
[20309.38s -> 20315.16s]  And it's like, oh, let's go do something. You cross that threshold of, you've got like from,
[20315.16s -> 20324.63s]  from like seven to eight PM to like one AM. You started about like six straight hours of drinking.
[20324.63s -> 20331.86s]  That's where you need, you need to be. That's gotten at that point. You're kind of, you're good.
[20337.10s -> 20341.42s]  What am I talking about? Talking about drinking after midnight or drinking after one AM or after
[20341.42s -> 20358.57s]  two, after one 30 boomer goes out at six and is what, no, I didn't say that. I didn't say that.
[20358.57s -> 20364.73s]  Okay. At midnight, you don't have to go. Well, fellas, it's 12 o'clock. And if I don't get home,
[20364.73s -> 20370.81s]  I'll turn it to a pumpkin, right? You don't have to do that. You just stay out. No, you can,
[20370.81s -> 20384.89s]  you can hang out still backtracking Barry. No, that's not, I didn't say you had to leave.
[20385.53s -> 20392.57s]  I didn't say you had to like, if you're, I didn't say you had to leave if, okay, if you're hanging
[20392.57s -> 20397.67s]  out with friends at like a buddy's house and it's like, you don't have to just leave, stay,
[20398.47s -> 20407.11s]  just don't drink after 12 30 after one 30. It's okay. It's like, it's like a calm cast guy window
[20407.75s -> 20430.50s]  between 12 and one 30. They go and take a fucking lift takeovers. Don't, don't be a fucking idiot.
[20431.14s -> 20446.12s]  For the love of God, for the love of God, please. All right. Why was he screaming at us? I wasn't
[20446.12s -> 20462.89s]  screaming at you. Drink some water for eight hours on a stream. I mean, I kind of do that already.
[20468.68s -> 20471.80s]  Yeah. I'm not going to tell you how you should drink if you're of the age to drink.
[20472.52s -> 20479.05s]  Just be careful. Look, I'm 37. Okay. Listen to me. I'm, I'm listening to me. I'm your goddamn
[20479.05s -> 20487.32s]  grandpa. Okay. I'm your goddamn grandpa. Listen to your grandpa. All right. So I've walked in a
[20487.32s -> 20493.51s]  circle for, you know, 10 straight minutes. That's how we know that time to probably turn the stream
[20493.51s -> 20501.02s]  off. I did the build the Minecraft wall and take the Minecraft wall down 10 times while we talked
[20501.02s -> 20529.29s]  about something. You're 37 omega low. Oh, come on. He's a rambling old man now. What? All right. This
[20529.29s -> 20535.93s]  game is really fun. We might pick this back up again. I definitely want to, I want to do Breath
[20535.93s -> 20548.87s]  of the Wild tomorrow though, between 12 and one 30. That's it. Vodka pineapple, vodka cranberry,
[20548.87s -> 20561.80s]  good whiskey, and just drink responsibly. It makes me old man. All right. I'll see you guys
[20561.80s -> 20577.45s]  tomorrow. Breath of the Wild will start probably closer to three tomorrow, not two. So that's what
[20577.45s -> 20580.41s]  we're going to do. Breath of the Wild. We'll continue playing it. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[20580.41s -> 20585.72s]  Thanks for watching. This has been Slime Rancher 2. It's been, it's good. It's kind of just Slime
[20585.72s -> 20593.29s]  Rancher 1 again, but it, it feels like they, they just, they have Slime Rancher 1 and they're like,
[20593.29s -> 20599.24s]  let's just make that again and put a bunch of other shit in it. So, and that's not a complaint.
[20599.24s -> 20623.35s]  Like I said, it, it's great to get more of that game. So anyways, uh, hold on a second. Is,
[20631.43s -> 20652.47s]  is the Vinesauce stuff going on right now? Is Joel, Joel going right now? All right. Cool.
[20652.47s -> 20658.31s]  I believe, I think Joel and all the rest of the Vinesauce crew there, I think they're doing a
[20658.31s -> 20674.15s]  charity event right now. I'm going to raid Joel. Yeah. Let's, let's, uh, go say hello,
[20674.15s -> 20683.50s]  go support, uh, go support their, uh, streams and everything they do inside. It's called Stream of
[20683.50s -> 20691.00s]  Conscious, uh, for St. Jude's Children Hospital. And I believe he's doing Vine Wrestle. So, I mean,
[20691.00s -> 20698.68s]  like go enjoy that. That's always a treat. All right. I will see you guys later. Thanks for
[20698.68s -> 20708.57s]  watching everybody. Take care of yourselves today. It was kind of an unhinged stream today,
[20708.57s -> 20726.87s]  but whatever. Sometimes it just happens. It wasn't too weird. I mean, it was kind of weird
[20726.87s -> 20747.42s]  eating a meal, succulent Chinese meal. Yeah. I'll see you guys later. Breath of the Wild tomorrow.
[20747.42s -> 20751.42s]  Good night. Goodbye. 3 PM Pacific. Mark it on your calendar, even though it's tomorrow.
[20751.42s -> 20768.87s]  Take care of yourselves. Good night. And please behave over on Joel's channel. I will be very
[20768.87s -> 20773.70s]  upset if I hear that either you were misbehaving. I will actually be annoyed by it. Don't misbehave.
[20774.10s -> 20781.45s]  Be good. Be nice. Be supportive. Or I'm going to be very upset. You understand? I'm going to
[20781.45s -> 20793.74s]  be very upset about it. And I'll, I don't know. I'll be told. Take it easy.
