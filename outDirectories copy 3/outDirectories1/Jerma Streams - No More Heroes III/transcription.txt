[191.40s -> 198.62s]  thanks for the reminder I've been looking forward to this game I wanted to play it since they
[198.62s -> 204.31s]  announced it I was a big fan of the first one and I hated the first one I was a huge fan of the
[204.31s -> 208.52s]  second one and I hated the second one I think that's just how it is when you're a no more
[208.52s -> 215.26s]  heroes fan you love these games so much but you also don't like them at all it's a really
[215.26s -> 225.08s]  weird way to go about it this series is one of my favorite actual series but I hate these games
[225.08s -> 234.07s]  it's weird he's gonna hate this one I'm just fucking around everybody come on
[234.95s -> 239.54s]  but you'd have been here before actually some of you may not have been here before
[239.54s -> 244.50s]  now but I like the games are always really fun but they're a little they're a little grungy
[245.22s -> 251.21s]  that makes any sense I'm fully expecting that no I didn't play Travis Strikes again because
[252.25s -> 258.14s]  I don't know it's like three times as long as all the no more heroes main games and it's a
[258.14s -> 264.65s]  top-down game I want to like slash around the sword and jump around and don't be paper don't
[264.65s -> 272.44s]  let paper Mario thousand year door be a wicked lie it's not a lie it just it was reality if I'm
[272.44s -> 276.60s]  going to stream like twice a week somewhere between one and two times a week on the weekends
[278.20s -> 282.36s]  I can't like thousand year door is like a thousand year long game it's a thousand hours
[283.00s -> 286.34s]  I don't think I could do it it would take me I would take forever
[289.22s -> 302.20s]  all right I'm ready I'm ready to go I think thousand year game yeah
[302.20s -> 306.63s]  thought you were streaming on Friday I figured we would just go back to the weekends like we
[306.63s -> 316.02s]  were supposed to so from here on out you are to expect a Saturday Sunday experience maybe Friday
[317.61s -> 323.90s]  Saturday Friday Saturday Saturday only Saturday Sunday I think it's a it's a good place to be
[324.54s -> 330.39s]  and I wanted to kind of get back to that schedule so this is going to be
[331.37s -> 335.21s]  uh we'll do Saturday Sunday because this game's obviously not just going to be one and done
[335.21s -> 338.33s]  because I have to I'm playing through the game because I fucking love this game I love this
[338.33s -> 344.46s]  series I hate this series so you know we have to do it uh this one actually is I think it's
[344.46s -> 351.54s]  supposed to be a little longer than the uh than the other two so we'll see like a bug just no
[355.93s -> 367.46s]  let's bring it over all right I'm ready how come there's no audio can you guys hear anything bad
[367.46s -> 374.26s]  controllers here we come I am playing with the joy cons and I know that that's I I don't like
[374.26s -> 380.02s]  these things but it says for the best experience use the joy cons and I just got 10 community subs
[380.02s -> 385.32s]  from James Morris thank you appreciate it but I also want to play the regular difficulty not
[385.32s -> 391.38s]  the hard one I'm not going to play this mode this is just like the cutscene mode I'm going to play
[391.38s -> 401.08s]  bitter formidable foes normal recommended difficulty hey Taylor uh thanks for those 10
[401.08s -> 407.62s]  community subs you didn't play Travis strikes again you aren't going to understand anything
[412.95s -> 417.59s]  no I don't I look they're gonna they're going to do the thing that they do in all these games if
[417.59s -> 423.99s]  you there's a one gigantic side game in the middle they're gonna do a previously on the next game of
[423.99s -> 428.98s]  thrones cutscene that happens before I start the game we're gonna get caught up in the first cut
[428.98s -> 436.38s]  scene that's how they do it because then I don't have to play the game and would you look at that
[436.38s -> 442.89s]  we've got another 10 give me to do subs from uh Vince smoke thank you I've not been calling out
[442.89s -> 446.86s]  any of the big community subs recently because I really haven't been able to look
[447.42s -> 453.96s]  all right here you go ready previously on no more heroes I'm starting I'm ready I'm gonna milk this
[453.96s -> 463.05s]  because I've been waiting for this game for like three years you hear anything there's no sound
[463.05s -> 468.87s]  once the difficulty level has been set it cannot be changed later during the game are you sure
[468.87s -> 488.04s]  I'm sure there's an audio oh there is oh suda 51 loves his like retro I'm looking forward to the
[488.12s -> 503.48s]  minigames are there any minigames in this one press any button death hand death claw was it
[503.48s -> 514.02s]  stage one I remembered this game I used to play nobody at school had it but I was super into it
[514.02s -> 521.02s]  for some reason it was called death man oh it's called toe jamming earth was a side scrolling
[521.02s -> 529.46s]  action game it was like a clone of one of those famous Japanese games but it was so cool these
[529.46s -> 535.38s]  aliens from the planet death take over earth and they print the human scores on their arms
[536.10s -> 544.46s]  intelligence and beauty if either score drops below 100 they get killed a murder show begins
[545.38s -> 552.12s]  oh the murder show trope right but one man put a stop to this terrible game that's right it's
[552.12s -> 558.98s]  death man death man fights against the death aliens to protect the planet earth he kills off
[559.06s -> 567.58s]  all 10 of the top evil death aliens then when he kills general death at the end
[567.58s -> 578.54s]  death man reveals his true identity it's Travis touchdown is that man how did it end I totally
[578.54s -> 587.45s]  forgot the watch mojo and is still unsolved for me and we're pretty sure oh yeah that lady that
[587.45s -> 592.26s]  does that voice remake version and we're pretty sure that they're looking for a comeback we find
[592.26s -> 598.76s]  out who death man really is finally they probably have they probably
[599.40s -> 612.60s]  death oh and don't forget the uh the the 10 to 20 gift clips of a friends episode oh there's
[612.60s -> 627.13s]  chandler and he's shaking oh shit i play how do i punch it looks like roger from american dead

[1479.27s -> 1483.67s]  unknown this is this might be travis strikes again info search to include the entire galaxy
[1483.67s -> 1492.36s]  head a hit out ending supernova an energy stump of the planet gest baptiste so they really are
[1492.36s -> 1503.18s]  aliens things are getting real funky real quick mission accomplished easy where the rest of them
[1503.98s -> 1513.90s]  it's only polite to accept an invitation to kick ass master i believe the time has come to use
[1514.70s -> 1529.83s]  it loading the dd system okay we missed a lot in the last game oh he does a hinge in a gogo
[1530.55s -> 1551.02s]  they don't explain how they got this oh so okay maybe we didn't miss very much it just has this
[1551.90s -> 1563.93s]  fuckhead here's the travis i know he better be in smash brothers eventually like i'd be upset if
[1563.93s -> 1580.55s]  he wasn't you're behind enemy lines it's just always assumed you were are you tweaking this
[1580.55s -> 1587.27s]  is how i've always sounded that's pretty badass if there's anything you're not clearer let me know
[1587.27s -> 1594.39s]  i'll lay it out for you ah so you're basically my navigator huh come on man don't underestimate
[1594.39s -> 1602.55s]  my prowess in battle i'm right up there with yeah rick what is gonna make things more
[1604.71s -> 1606.63s]  who is that let's go
[1615.66s -> 1639.91s]  i like the heavy slaps oh this is good this is fun this is fun oh i got a battery so much
[1640.87s -> 1653.75s]  android blood what is he saying voice the fuck out as you can see things got all funky
[1653.75s -> 1661.40s]  quick probably some planet eating type dude waiting all yoked and powerful and trying to
[1661.40s -> 1669.37s]  take over the world or something this looks so good but don't you worry let's hold on
[1670.81s -> 1676.89s]  what i don't read any reviews i don't care they're totally i just go in blind i don't touch down
[1676.97s -> 1682.92s]  let's let's play here to save the world i'm also just a passing assassin
[1683.88s -> 1695.05s]  here we go taking a kill trip on death road especially with the game even looking forward
[1695.05s -> 1701.46s]  to right it's me now i feel bad for the people that did that with cyberpunk but you know what
[1701.46s -> 1706.68s]  to do i've been looking forward to this for like the last three or four years more than that
[1706.84s -> 1715.58s]  kill them all the insanity travis let it fly there we go primitive insanity
[1716.79s -> 1723.50s]  safeguarded insanity so we're just going right into a boss or something like this right immediately
[1723.50s -> 1745.66s]  into a dash oh okay press it in too many beers oh shit i need a toilet perfect location oh yeah
[1745.66s -> 1751.42s]  don't forget always stop by the toilet if you find one especially before boss fights you need time to
[1751.42s -> 1760.58s]  get your thoughts in order so you know save your damn game i like how they did make him older
[1761.14s -> 1780.04s]  right saving i'm i want to play the mini games i'm so excited i can't wait access the sushi shop
[1780.68s -> 1793.50s]  this is the sushi shop hey irash i i am bug zaburo yummy yummy yummy get some fish in your tummy
[1795.27s -> 1799.03s]  probably thinking what's a sushi place doing inside of a ufo like this right well but listen
[1799.99s -> 1805.06s]  i used to have a shop in santa destroy but it got sucked up in that light from the sky and i
[1805.06s -> 1811.46s]  ended up in here somehow anyways enough about my problems how about some sushi buddy use l and r
[1811.46s -> 1817.02s]  to choose take out or eat in take out is well exactly what it sounds like grab a quick bite
[1817.02s -> 1822.87s]  when you get hungry during battle what's this a counter over on the right side why is it counting
[1824.15s -> 1828.47s]  okay so you can take with you eat it means you can sit here and get filled up and get
[1829.43s -> 1836.14s]  ripped rarin to go for the next battle it's like monster hunter okay we have excellent choices
[1836.86s -> 1844.02s]  i'm a huge fan of dawn my sushi they've got all sorts of sushi to choose from so she's actually

[5297.54s -> 5305.30s]  lot of attention span so i don't know if i buy the like zoomers don't have an attention span
[5305.30s -> 5315.00s]  anymore but that's instant gratification i guess you could say that right
[5316.52s -> 5322.95s]  fuck it's actually hard to do because like you can you can load up the next episode immediately
[5326.07s -> 5337.10s]  yeah god all right all right my previous high score i'm just gonna beat that

[5375.82s -> 5383.61s]  do in at least 20 i love that i can't wait to do that again but for now time to there's a time
[5383.61s -> 5405.45s]  to do it's not a worse noise i do that all the time downstairs okay i remember when i had to
[5405.45s -> 5410.89s]  wait till next week for the new episode netflix changed things yeah but it's almost like a 50
[5410.89s -> 5415.14s]  50 shot some series just dumped the whole thing up there don't they although they kind of stopped

[5920.60s -> 5926.70s]  the room like there is an iron which i think is a mistake if you're gonna have an iron in every
[5926.70s -> 5931.67s]  single room there should be a plunger in the closet too or something no one on the closet
[5931.67s -> 5936.39s]  because if you you don't i mean like because if i clog the toilet in a hotel room you have to call
[5936.39s -> 5946.25s]  the front desk and you have to say hi i'm having them uh having a problem with my toilet device
[5946.25s -> 5953.35s]  i can send uh maintenance up to have a toilet issue and then they have to come up and they go
[5953.35s -> 5957.91s]  all right yeah what's up i was up does it pro is a toilet problem like how why it's so embarrassing

[7556.07s -> 7561.35s]  30 more minutes you want me to i'm not gonna keep that up for 30 minutes that's not worst joke 2021
[7561.35s -> 7568.26s]  come on because i'm pretending to have like way more people hate me than that actually come on
[7568.26s -> 7582.60s]  that's not the worst joke of 2021 i thought it was plus two personally all right so he has a do a
[7582.60s -> 7589.48s]  perfect dodge that's not what it's perfect but i'll take it all right it's like one let's see
[7590.78s -> 7593.42s]  one it seems pretty perfect to me
[7601.06s -> 7606.44s]  strawberry all right perfect dodge right before you get hit there it is
[7611.85s -> 7626.50s]  stunned nope now he is for the four pixels on the block yeah i actually don't know what those are
[7626.50s -> 7643.91s]  that's a good question i've yet to figure that out what those are oh it's item slug
[7647.90s -> 7670.06s]  that's sushi okay all right finally an s with dead pixel you know what's really weird about
[7670.06s -> 7677.69s]  dead pixels so like 10 years ago i feel like they've solved that problem because 10 to 15
[7677.69s -> 7683.53s]  years ago every monitor i ever had it was always such a tragic awful event when you would just see
[7683.53s -> 7688.62s]  the green dot appear i have not had a dead pixel on any monitor that i've had in the last probably
[7688.62s -> 7697.72s]  five years but it used to happen all the time so what i have to do three coins or something
[7697.72s -> 7710.49s]  this is my bike i remember sitting there with my fingernail out just tapping it a hundred times
[7711.69s -> 7720.26s]  there was so many weird old wives tales how to fix a dead pixel get a cloth put the cloth over the
[7720.26s -> 7726.26s]  dead pixel take a hammer slightly tap the hammer onto the cloth onto the pixel and then rub garlic
[7726.26s -> 7746.73s]  under your armpits none of them ever actually even did anything oh it's a scorpion how do i
[7746.73s -> 7765.59s]  get it i get it it smells fruity it reminds me of uh creepy crawlers creepy crawlers those weird
[7765.59s -> 7790.22s]  like plastic gel um they like smelled didn't they oh goodness triple putt watch out for his charges
[7790.22s -> 7795.38s]  when he turns invisible if you can dodge him then get behind him and whoop his ass bouncing all over
[7795.38s -> 7801.13s]  the place like that he's gonna try to hit and run me i gotta find a way to take him down they can
[7801.13s -> 7810.06s]  turn invisible and then wait for them to come out of invisibility i all right i will say that i
[7810.06s -> 7814.79s]  really like this one so far out of the two or three of them that have been out there so far
[7815.51s -> 7821.32s]  because it's not just guy in a suit almost every single enemy in the other normal heroes games
[7821.32s -> 7835.50s]  were just dudes with bats or guys in suits so there's like actual variety in the enemy
[7835.50s -> 7861.42s]  types which is really cool all right let's see what do you got come on whoa he jumped over it
[7861.42s -> 7879.54s]  what's the pokemon that is looking all the huge arms like this man champ yep grab him grab him
[7879.54s -> 7917.29s]  it's not his name what's his name my champ whatever man champ my champ so there's a blue
[7917.29s -> 7924.54s]  and a red one the blue one is probably just optional i assume right well i'm becoming
[7924.54s -> 7941.53s]  obsessive so i'm starting to become a little obsessive i want to do them all although i
[7941.53s -> 7948.23s]  there's a toilet over here hold on i did not hit that lady that's a lie fake didn't touch that

[8607.21s -> 8615.83s]  worth i didn't have grass the basics next is the real thing prepare yourself appropriately
[8615.83s -> 8631.67s]  okay next is the real thing new level is unlocked well i want to do it level one volunteer mission
[8631.67s -> 8667.82s]  yes oh this is where it becomes real okay all right no messing around here all right whatever
[8667.82s -> 8684.46s]  d in turn makes you turn sharper okay let's do that of course the camera move with you this
[8684.46s -> 8708.07s]  actually was a better tactic how is that a better tactic all right now let's clean the rest up and
[8708.07s -> 8725.50s]  i'll be good back it up inefficient andy it doesn't need to be efficient just need to get done fast
[8726.30s -> 8761.75s]  you see that silver those controls are weird i think this is reward all right now i got 5000 um
[8762.55s -> 8772.87s]  wesson now i can get the shirt is there another level a little too everything's fine let you know
[8772.87s -> 8789.72s]  if anything comes up all right getting it done fast is what efficiency is well but what an
[8789.72s -> 8797.62s]  efficiency you can be really fast and do a terrible job that's not efficient if you go so fast that
[8797.62s -> 8803.26s]  you fuck the whole thing up you're just doing it as you're rushing that's not efficient if it's bad
[8803.26s -> 8814.47s]  efficient is fast and well exactly just because you sprint 100 miles per hour and go really fast
[8814.47s -> 8822.12s]  doesn't mean you did a good job that means that's inefficient you're bad at both though that's fine
[8822.12s -> 8831.18s]  don't listen to the haters yeah i know what the fuck there's a bunch of haters
[8831.18s -> 8838.84s]  if one of his shots hits you it'll screw up your death glove if he gets you in his sights dodge
[8838.84s -> 8843.98s]  he's small but definitely tough this could be a hassle but that name though leo pardon is pretty
[8843.98s -> 8859.69s]  badass okay so be careful just be careful here we go blood berry this guy's a boss
[8861.85s -> 8888.22s]  all right he's got like a cube all right let's go for a dodge nice you know i kind of like is

[8999.38s -> 9022.95s]  what hit me that was cool i think that was pretty clean i was like an a what i thought that was
[9022.95s -> 9044.14s]  pretty clean to kick more for the high score yeah i keep forgetting i have it so that's that now
[9044.14s -> 9051.10s]  what cleared all the designated matches needed to enter the ranking battles we need to do next is
[9051.10s -> 9055.74s]  get to an atm and transfer the funds for the tournament entry fee it seems to show on the map
[9055.74s -> 9063.08s]  with a icon that looks i don't i don't even know what that is there's like a house like a bank
[9063.80s -> 9075.90s]  there's a really weird icon does that say atm oh it's okay i thought it was like a city you can
[9075.90s -> 9084.62s]  check out the coordinates on the map what the fuck is wrong with me you can check out the conditions
[9084.62s -> 9089.98s]  required to enter ranking battles via mail in the menu be sure to read them carefully
[9098.06s -> 9109.61s]  new mail i want to go to the mail how do i get to the mail what the hell pause this isn't mail

[9215.88s -> 9237.77s]  the difference this game stays on and this is actually fun no for a second i thought it
[9237.77s -> 9246.25s]  crashed i was about to laugh old family has served the royal family for about 23 700 years now
[9246.25s -> 9252.54s]  it has been pretty long this is apparently a specialty of this planet these humans line
[9252.54s -> 9261.18s]  up for more than two hours for this shit and you got some just for me i had damon's secretary
[9261.18s -> 9273.22s]  line up for it long lines delicious these little balls they drinking boba really that good

[9301.40s -> 9310.20s]  my life your majesty life isn't something you give away it's something you protect your majesty
[9310.20s -> 9313.32s]  didn't he like nuke like 600 million people in the beginning of the game
[9314.60s -> 9338.18s]  they kind of grow on you damn okay we gotta clean up here a lot of pizza okay here we go
[9338.18s -> 9342.58s]  rank matches access this entrance and you'll be thrown into a series of life or death battles
[9342.58s -> 9350.44s]  against the other rankers basically it's a bunch of boss battles okay you've got toilet breaks
[9350.44s -> 9356.36s]  sushi you can buy the power-up machine and death glove chips use all these to add your advantage
[9356.36s -> 9361.35s]  and be sure to prepare yourself for the deadly battles ahead good luck interesting
[9368.07s -> 9373.42s]  if i'm feeding the cat a candy bar this is weird what was that that's okay
[9375.16s -> 9404.12s]  the cat tree oh bonito flakes all right let's change i want to change clothes
[9404.12s -> 9434.20s]  put the jacket back on oh i have a mr black hole shirt i like that kill kill kill i get the kill
[9434.52s -> 9452.15s]  kale shirt all right kill kill kill back it off yeah keep the jacket off and what else can i do
[9452.87s -> 9468.62s]  now i'm about to do i'm about to fight um what's his name gold joe what the hell is this power-up
[9468.62s -> 9479.93s]  machine hey creepy ass otaku i'll use my power-up machine to enhance your skills for you stick in
[9479.93s -> 9488.97s]  all the wesson you got it's a power-up machine in dr naomi's lab by feeding wesson worlds and
[9488.97s -> 9492.41s]  supernova into the power-up machine you can enhance your health attack power power and
[9492.41s -> 9497.22s]  cooldown time required for using skills you can also use it to acquire new techniques
[9498.02s -> 9502.22s]  you can readjust your various status levels so try tweaking the balance till you find your
[9502.22s -> 9514.09s]  sweet spot and don't worry you can get back the wesson you put in power how do i do this a down
[9514.73s -> 9529.75s]  okay this is my power health attack power battery power level two death skill
[9530.47s -> 9541.16s]  for dash attack shake that to special ties when handheld style hold on i'm not gonna read this
[9541.16s -> 9552.94s]  again while dashing shake allows you to special attack okay so while i'm running i shake and i
[9552.94s -> 9559.13s]  can do a jumping slash cool is there anything else i can do i probably should do health right
[9559.13s -> 9568.54s]  that makes the most sense right now well i love this game i love this game this is very good
[9569.34s -> 9580.78s]  i'll do attack as well yeah i'm gonna do attack again hey i'm gonna do attack again
[9581.42s -> 9587.26s]  fuck i don't have money power level definitely i'm the battery andy let me i'm gonna do this twice
[9590.28s -> 9604.79s]  i don't want to deal with this can i do any more it's 1200 that looks pretty good for now
[9604.79s -> 9618.36s]  no special moves though i'm sorry that's cool time machine what is a time machine
[9619.00s -> 9624.57s]  it's a time machine in dr naomi's lab you can use it to have rematches against rankers you
[9624.57s -> 9629.37s]  fought in the past set the difficulty level higher to receive more awesome rewards for winning
[9630.01s -> 9648.62s]  so you just it's like a boss farm interesting okay death glove chip here you can equip and
[9648.62s -> 9660.39s]  create death glove chips what do you want to do equip here's the supercomputer access this to
[9660.39s -> 9665.61s]  create and equip death glove chips items which provide a wide range of special effects up to
[9665.69s -> 9670.33s]  three death glove chips can be equipped at once each chip has a strength and weakness find the
[9670.33s -> 9674.95s]  one that best suits your needs because i don't have any chips so let's say we're going to create
[9676.31s -> 9683.22s]  this keeps up this game of the year let me tell you right now the security access that's great
[9683.22s -> 9687.94s]  and equip death glove chips okay to create a chip you'll need junk for raw materials
[9689.29s -> 9697.43s]  and utopia coins to pay for development costs okay that's what the weird material i've been
[9697.43s -> 9702.26s]  getting junk is dropped by enemies and can be received as a reward for clearing volunteer
[9702.26s -> 9707.86s]  missions right like i've been doing and junk has different rarity the rarer the junk the harder
[9707.86s -> 9716.04s]  it is to find right so i have 500 bucks number one great chip trigger chip
[9721.16s -> 9735.11s]  what the fuck what there are 52 of these which i do how about number 35 that's how old i am so

[9747.75s -> 9764.98s]  okay hold on after successful guard power consumed 20 down you'll get it later oh this is cool
[9766.44s -> 9774.22s]  normal attack power down five percent heavy attack power 10 up i don't know i kind of like that
[9774.62s -> 9782.97s]  it's five start at the top so as you take more damage but you do more damage
[9790.41s -> 9795.61s]  the world got psychonauts 2 and no more heroes 3 in a week we really do not deserve this
[9796.81s -> 9810.97s]  should i do damage yeah let's go mash the a button hard so there's one out of three do i have to wait
[9810.97s -> 9828.98s]  i have to do it three times to get it so i have to do this three times now once enough oh oh i have
[9828.98s -> 9835.78s]  three slots i've got three slots holy shit oh my god this opens up so much stuff okay

[10356.36s -> 10360.60s]  i die that's the die sound i started to feel the sneeze coming on and i was like fuck i gotta i
[10360.60s -> 10366.20s]  gotta be ready so i was gonna go like cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo sneeze and but it didn't
[10366.20s -> 10370.12s]  work out that way it actually just kind of came out i couldn't even do the first part of the joke
[10370.12s -> 10390.41s]  let me move this that's then it's not the joke worst unfinished joke you're so cringe germa no

[10465.10s -> 10469.98s]  means these guys have all come from different planets this sounds dangerous we got to think
[10469.98s -> 10476.46s]  of a way to strike back just remember that earth also counts as a planet in space bloodthirsty
[10476.46s -> 10481.82s]  people are generally the same everywhere now come on let's go all right so what's your deal
[10493.24s -> 10497.80s]  he's about to change uh to get into the shower that's the only that's the move you do before
[10497.80s -> 10507.05s]  the pixelation comes on
[10533.05s -> 10538.97s]  something to think that you'd be ahead of us in this sort of artwork also that's way too much
[10538.97s -> 10544.65s]  time wasted on something like simple projection mapping don't waste budget money on shit like this
[10557.66s -> 10561.02s]  well judging by what i see i'm assuming you use magnets huh
[10564.30s -> 10571.58s]  snap crackle and pippity poppity poopity so you're going to use blue and red magnetic north south
[10571.58s -> 10583.88s]  to bust out some just slightly puzzlish attacks right damn that's what i thought bingo okay i'm
[10583.88s -> 10590.52s]  just gonna put this out there for red throw up an n mark above your head and throw up an s for blue
[10590.60s -> 10595.56s]  okay will make it simpler gamers like that kind of thing what does that mean i don't know if i can
[10595.56s -> 10604.36s]  it's a red and blue as you say but i'll try my best nice now show me a good time what do how do

[10632.68s -> 10648.07s]  he's blue now now that means i attack with blue i can attack whoa he's gonna hit the wall and
[10648.07s -> 10661.02s]  it's gonna hit the blue and i'm gonna get him points for it what that's not how magnets work
[10661.02s -> 10668.82s]  all right but when he said the really important line i didn't even my brain was not processing

[10892.79s -> 10906.16s]  Ha, ha, ha.
[10906.16s -> 10908.91s]  All right, phase three.
[10908.91s -> 10910.98s]  Back it up.
[10910.98s -> 10913.38s]  Holy fucking shit, that was a lot of damage.
[10914.66s -> 10926.06s]  Red, got it already.
[10926.06s -> 10927.85s]  What do you got?
[10927.85s -> 10936.08s]  Oh, I'm already blue.
[10937.04s -> 10939.77s]  I'm already blue.
[10939.77s -> 10945.39s]  What's he doing?
[10945.39s -> 10956.02s]  Oh, red.
[10956.02s -> 10960.82s]  Get over here.
[10960.82s -> 10962.21s]  Goodness.
[10962.21s -> 10965.02s]  We don't want color, color, color, color.
[10965.02s -> 10966.55s]  Color, what color?
[10966.55s -> 10970.86s]  Pick one, pick a color.
[10970.86s -> 10977.21s]  Blue, got it.
[10977.21s -> 10981.40s]  All right, say goodnight, so.
[10981.40s -> 10984.64s]  Oh, oh, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.
[10984.64s -> 10987.36s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10987.36s -> 10995.20s]  Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[10995.20s -> 11001.08s]  God, I got him.
[11001.08s -> 11007.02s]  I almost just died there.
[11007.02s -> 11007.98s]  That was cool.
[11007.98s -> 11023.18s]  I don't know if that's it, we're still in space.
[11023.18s -> 11024.86s]  Old Joe is dead.
[11024.86s -> 11025.70s]  Oh, I guess not.
[11025.70s -> 11028.50s]  I guess he's just dead.
[11028.50s -> 11029.82s]  I know, Adam Sandlin noises.
[11029.82s -> 11032.10s]  I'm gonna do those when I get into a situation
[11032.10s -> 11035.40s]  where I'm scared.
[11035.40s -> 11037.44s]  Is this the shit you've been smuggling?
[11037.44s -> 11040.24s]  Wow, you're a real shitty guy, huh?
[11040.24s -> 11043.16s]  Um, you probably shouldn't touch that stuff.
[11043.16s -> 11045.00s]  It's super dangerous.
[11045.00s -> 11048.56s]  It'll melt stuff, like everything.
[11048.56s -> 11050.28s]  That's why it makes such good money.
[11053.34s -> 11054.54s]  All right, then.
[11054.54s -> 11055.94s]  Bon appétit.
[11056.78s -> 11058.34s]  No, anything but that!
[11058.34s -> 11083.94s]  It's a Stardew Valley.
[11083.94s -> 11089.44s]  Damn.
[11089.44s -> 11091.72s]  It's the ones who don't look like bad guys
[11091.72s -> 11093.56s]  who are the real bad guys.
[11095.66s -> 11102.02s]  I see again.
[11102.02s -> 11104.78s]  Oh, well.
[11104.78s -> 11105.78s]  Somebody's saying I gotta use that.
[11105.78s -> 11110.02s]  How often does that kick refresh?
[11110.02s -> 11111.38s]  I did take a lot of damage, though.
[11111.38s -> 11112.22s]  I mean, come on.
[11112.22s -> 11113.06s]  The first time you see a boss,
[11113.06s -> 11116.48s]  I can go back in time traveling and get an S.
[11116.48s -> 11127.14s]  It's like every 30 seconds, every few minutes.
[11127.14s -> 11127.98s]  That was a cool fight, though.
[11127.98s -> 11132.32s]  That was fun.
[11132.32s -> 11134.00s]  Congratulations.
[11134.00s -> 11136.48s]  You have been recognized as number nine
[11136.48s -> 11138.44s]  in the galactic rankings.
[11139.32s -> 11140.56s]  What's that light?
[11140.56s -> 11142.28s]  Is it flying?
[11142.28s -> 11143.12s]  Well, yeah.
[11143.12s -> 11144.40s]  Talbot?
[11144.40s -> 11145.84s]  You guys are up.
[11145.84s -> 11149.32s]  You know, I never actually knew those dudes' names till now.
[11149.32s -> 11151.72s]  The series is going to keep going, right?
[11151.72s -> 11153.84s]  So we kinda had to give them names.
[11153.84s -> 11156.12s]  Council style, huh?
[11156.12s -> 11157.44s]  You like it, don't you?
[11157.44s -> 11158.40s]  They have names, yeah.
[11158.40s -> 11160.60s]  Not bad, but whatever.
[11160.60s -> 11162.12s]  This is space, right?
[11162.12s -> 11164.00s]  Can we do the small talk later?
[11164.00s -> 11164.84s]  Space?
[11164.84s -> 11166.44s]  You're still at the number nine spot.
[11166.44s -> 11167.96s]  You've got a ways to go.
[11168.84s -> 11169.68s]  Okay.
[11169.68s -> 11170.52s]  I thought you couldn't touch those.
[11170.52s -> 11173.40s]  But before all that, I wanna ask you something.
[11173.40s -> 11177.56s]  Also, I need to talk to you.
[11177.56s -> 11178.80s]  You ask me something?
[11178.80s -> 11180.44s]  Why are you helping them?
[11180.44s -> 11182.00s]  Is it because it's your job?
[11182.00s -> 11183.12s]  It is for you.
[11183.12s -> 11185.80s]  I mean, being your wife and all.
[11185.80s -> 11188.96s]  I do what I can to help my husband out.
[11188.96s -> 11190.92s]  What does that even mean?
[11190.92s -> 11193.84s]  These guys are basically evil aliens.
[11194.68s -> 11196.92s]  We do not know when they might swarm Earth.
[11196.92s -> 11199.84s]  So we need some kind of order here.
[11199.84s -> 11201.00s]  Yeah, that's true.
[11201.00s -> 11203.72s]  If we're using the same type of ranking system as usual,
[11203.72s -> 11206.24s]  then I've got a lot more experience.
[11206.24s -> 11211.00s]  That is why the UAA is running this thing.
[11211.00s -> 11212.20s]  Are they married?
[11212.20s -> 11213.96s]  Are the kids doing okay?
[11213.96s -> 11215.44s]  I don't remember that at the end of the second game.
[11215.44s -> 11216.92s]  We do not have time.
[11216.92s -> 11218.76s]  I will set up the match for the next ranking battle.
[11218.76s -> 11220.12s]  I said, what, did you say kids?
[11220.12s -> 11222.48s]  Make sure you kill them dead.
[11222.56s -> 11232.22s]  Sylvia, I still need to talk to you.
[11232.22s -> 11233.98s]  That's Travis Strikes Back lore.
[11240.28s -> 11241.56s]  I'll just read the Wikipedia page
[11241.56s -> 11249.14s]  for Travis Strikes Back, whatever it is.
[11249.14s -> 11260.35s]  All right, so we're number nine.
[11260.35s -> 11261.19s]  Oh, the intro.
[11261.19s -> 11269.55s]  Never skip the anime intro and outro.
[11269.55s -> 11275.12s]  I almost just accidentally did.
[11275.12s -> 11278.20s]  Every time you watch an anime intro and outro,
[11278.20s -> 11283.75s]  you experience those same internal dopamine hits.
[11283.75s -> 11285.54s]  Probably you never want to skip them.
[11285.54s -> 11287.18s]  Because everybody has their favorite moment
[11287.18s -> 11289.14s]  in the anime intro or outro.
[11289.18s -> 11290.70s]  Like their favorite character's on screen
[11290.70s -> 11293.58s]  doing something really cool, animated at 60 FPS,
[11293.58s -> 11294.78s]  because they don't do that in the real show,
[11294.78s -> 11296.52s]  the actual show.
[11296.52s -> 11298.60s]  Your favorite character does this like dash, slash, slash,
[11298.60s -> 11302.90s]  jump, eye into the camera at like 700 frames a second.
[11302.90s -> 11303.90s]  You know you're never going to get to see
[11303.90s -> 11305.62s]  that actually happen in the show.
[11305.62s -> 11308.53s]  Maybe you will in some shows.
[11308.53s -> 11330.04s]  Man, looks great in that intro.
[11330.04s -> 11341.51s]  So many shows intros are better than the actual show.
[11341.51s -> 11342.43s]  Game's already over.
[11342.43s -> 11344.03s]  It is not already over.
[11361.86s -> 11368.06s]  Travis Strikes Again next stream, loser.
[11368.22s -> 11373.64s]  Tell me what to do.
[11373.64s -> 11375.40s]  I hope we get, are you still watching?
[11375.40s -> 11376.24s]  That'd be hilarious.
[11376.24s -> 11377.32s]  The guest has arrived.
[11377.32s -> 11379.84s]  Mr. Black Knight direction.
[11379.84s -> 11381.94s]  Huh, let him in.
[11381.94s -> 11383.02s]  All right.
[11383.02s -> 11385.46s]  And just who do we have next?
[11385.46s -> 11387.90s]  The emperor of the night.
[11387.90s -> 11389.18s]  What?
[11389.18s -> 11390.78s]  Do you doubt our power?
[11390.78s -> 11391.86s]  No, no.
[11391.86s -> 11394.08s]  That's not what I meant.
[11394.08s -> 11396.40s]  I was hoping I could be of help.
[11396.40s -> 11397.72s]  You want to help?
[11397.72s -> 11400.86s]  Then sit there quietly.
[11400.86s -> 11413.06s]  Dick.
[11413.10s -> 11417.70s]  Lord Froon had to get to see you again.
[11417.70s -> 11421.54s]  Any wish of yours is old Black Knight directions command.
[11421.54s -> 11424.26s]  Travis must be dealt with.
[11424.26s -> 11426.12s]  I'm leaving him to you.
[11426.12s -> 11428.04s]  Don't let me down.
[11428.04s -> 11429.40s]  I will not let you down.
[11429.40s -> 11430.60s]  Interesting character.
[11435.05s -> 11438.86s]  I feel like there's three people in there.
[11438.86s -> 11441.02s]  Just people standing where the shoulders are.
[11441.02s -> 11453.16s]  And they're all moving as one.
[11453.16s -> 11475.02s]  They're on a custom map, GM flat grass.
[11475.02s -> 11477.90s]  Oh, that's funny.
[11477.94s -> 11479.78s]  What's Mieke's best film?
[11479.78s -> 11481.18s]  That'd be Gozu.
[11481.18s -> 11482.34s]  What do you think?
[11482.34s -> 11485.02s]  Gozu, of course.
[11485.02s -> 11487.86s]  What's the most bad ass Mieke film then?
[11487.86s -> 11488.92s]  Dead or Alive.
[11488.92s -> 11489.76s]  You?
[11489.76s -> 11491.24s]  Shield or Straw.
[11491.24s -> 11493.72s]  Nice.
[11493.72s -> 11495.88s]  What's the most fucked up Mieke film?
[11495.88s -> 11497.12s]  Audition, right?
[11497.12s -> 11497.96s]  Everything you need to-
[11497.96s -> 11499.52s]  Hold on, here it is.
[11499.52s -> 11500.68s]  Visitor Q.
[11500.68s -> 11503.12s]  Oh shit, I haven't seen that one.
[11503.12s -> 11504.08s]  For reals?
[11504.08s -> 11506.68s]  Oh, you gotta see Visitor Q.
[11506.68s -> 11508.08s]  Let me borrow it.
[11508.08s -> 11508.92s]  Nope.
[11508.92s -> 11510.36s]  I'm totally gonna keep it.
[11510.36s -> 11511.20s]  I'll keep it back.
[11511.20s -> 11512.88s]  Come on, you know I will.
[11512.88s -> 11513.72s]  Hell no.
[11513.72s -> 11516.66s]  You always steal my shit after borrowing it.
[11516.66s -> 11518.06s]  Okay, then check this out.
[11518.06s -> 11520.70s]  I'll lend you the whole Kaoru Chan series.
[11522.14s -> 11523.58s]  You're so badass.
[11523.58s -> 11525.26s]  Yeah, Mieke is hella badass.
[11525.26s -> 11527.94s]  By the way, this is all actual film commentary?
[11530.55s -> 11531.39s]  What do you mean?
[11531.39s -> 11535.22s]  That'd be the shit.
[11535.22s -> 11538.78s]  They pulled transcripts from actual film critic stuff?
[11538.78s -> 11539.90s]  They're real.
[11539.90s -> 11540.74s]  Really.
[11542.62s -> 11549.10s]  Oh, I got the Gold Joe T-shirt.
[11549.10s -> 11549.94s]  I kinda need to see that.
[11549.94s -> 11558.59s]  I feel like I'm gonna put that on.
[11558.59s -> 11576.35s]  Ooh, I like that.
[11576.35s -> 11577.19s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[11577.19s -> 11584.16s]  I wanna see.
[11584.16s -> 11587.65s]  Come on.
[11587.65s -> 11588.49s]  I pressed L.
[11588.49s -> 11590.91s]  I don't know why it didn't register.
[11590.91s -> 11592.53s]  L, R.
[11592.53s -> 11594.09s]  I can't switch to L.
[11594.09s -> 11598.69s]  Oh, it's cause this is a whole outfit.
[11598.69s -> 11604.70s]  Oh, I get it.
[11604.70s -> 11607.89s]  Till.
[11607.89s -> 11609.45s]  They're talking about real movies.
[11609.45s -> 11612.27s]  Oh, it was Gold Joe.
[11617.22s -> 11625.34s]  I wish the Gold Joe shirt was actually gold.
[11625.34s -> 11630.02s]  You think it should be gold?
[11630.54s -> 11634.47s]  I'll put that on.
[11634.47s -> 11640.10s]  I'll wear the jacket for a little while.
[11640.10s -> 11644.37s]  And we gotta change our outfit every time we get a chance.
[11644.37s -> 11646.71s]  I don't wanna just wear the same thing.
[11646.71s -> 11647.53s]  Okay, save it.
[11647.53s -> 11648.37s]  Wait, Gene.
[11660.55s -> 11664.57s]  What is the last Japanese movie you watched?
[11664.57s -> 11665.89s]  I don't know.
[11665.89s -> 11669.19s]  I can't tell you the last movie I watched.
[11669.19s -> 11670.61s]  Can I?
[11670.61s -> 11672.09s]  Oh, yes, I can.
[11672.09s -> 11689.68s]  Cromwell.
[11689.68s -> 11690.76s]  Was it good?
[11690.76s -> 11691.58s]  I don't know.
[11691.58s -> 11692.42s]  It was free on YouTube,
[11692.42s -> 11693.26s]  and I was just like,
[11693.26s -> 11697.06s]  this is kinda funny to watch this.
[11697.06s -> 11700.63s]  It's one of those movies where everyone talks like this.
[11700.67s -> 11702.83s]  Will it please the court for them to know
[11702.83s -> 11704.99s]  that Cromwell, I will be exiled?
[11704.99s -> 11708.69s]  Like, it's one of those movies.
[11708.69s -> 11710.17s]  Parliament, parliament needs to,
[11710.17s -> 11713.35s]  I will not stand for parliament.
[11713.35s -> 11717.37s]  We will absolve and dissolve parliament.
[11717.37s -> 11718.37s]  That was the whole movie.
[11718.37s -> 11726.28s]  And then there was a bunch of fight scenes and stuff.
[11726.28s -> 11731.77s]  All right, I gotta kill some more people.
[11731.77s -> 11735.13s]  What was the last Japanese movie you watched?
[11735.13s -> 11735.97s]  Cromwell.
[11735.97s -> 11736.97s]  No, I didn't.
[11736.97s -> 11738.09s]  Cromwell takes place,
[11738.09s -> 11742.85s]  it's based on the English and Ireland and Scotland.
[11742.85s -> 11745.01s]  They're all fighting each other as priests and shit,
[11745.01s -> 11746.53s]  and because they ride horses,
[11746.53s -> 11750.09s]  they throw knives at each other and stuff.
[11750.09s -> 11751.37s]  They have sword fights,
[11751.37s -> 11755.41s]  and I don't know what his name is,
[11755.41s -> 11756.49s]  something Cromwell.
[11756.49s -> 11758.93s]  He ends up becoming the King of England,
[11758.93s -> 11762.28s]  or whatever it was, I don't remember.
[11762.28s -> 11765.56s]  I've slept and woke up three times.
[11765.56s -> 11767.90s]  The ads woke me up, okay?
[11767.90s -> 11768.82s]  I'll be honest with you.
[11768.82s -> 11770.18s]  If you watch YouTube movies for free,
[11770.18s -> 11771.38s]  the ones that are on YouTube,
[11771.38s -> 11773.06s]  there's like 10 ads throughout the movie,
[11773.14s -> 11778.56s]  and they'll wake you up if you're fucking asleep.
[11778.56s -> 11781.28s]  I don't know when the last Japanese movie I watched is.
[11781.28s -> 11784.66s]  I have no idea.
[11784.66s -> 11793.80s]  I don't know.
[11793.80s -> 11797.74s]  You level up, like, oh no, you have to get, okay.
[11797.74s -> 11799.26s]  He never became the King.
[11799.26s -> 11802.27s]  No, he owned Parliament.
[11802.27s -> 11804.19s]  He got rid of Parliament,
[11804.19s -> 11806.47s]  and then he brought back Parliament,
[11806.47s -> 11808.83s]  because the King got rid of Parliament.
[11808.83s -> 11810.99s]  So it was like, we need to fight to get Parliament back.
[11810.99s -> 11812.71s]  I don't know, they said Parliament,
[11812.71s -> 11822.51s]  they said that word like 400 times in the movie.
[11822.51s -> 11823.66s]  Oh, nice.
[11823.66s -> 11829.49s]  Shedded snakeskin.
[11829.49s -> 11831.13s]  And then he became King of Japan.
[11837.06s -> 11840.46s]  What was the last, like, okay, movie based on Japan,
[11840.46s -> 11845.56s]  or in Japan, or like a Japanese film?
[11845.56s -> 11853.44s]  Name some Japanese films that have come out.
[11853.44s -> 11859.86s]  Maybe I've seen them, I don't know.
[11859.86s -> 11860.82s]  Oh, I got a card.
[11873.05s -> 11875.41s]  Romwell's really good.
[11875.41s -> 11883.37s]  I mean, it was entertaining.
[11883.37s -> 11884.77s]  Need to watch Akira.
[11884.77s -> 11887.29s]  I've already seen Akira.
[11887.29s -> 11906.85s]  Two decades ago, whatever, a decade ago.
[11906.85s -> 11914.28s]  Seen Spirited Away, yeah, a long time ago.
[11914.28s -> 11916.76s]  Ooh, Flame Tea.
[11917.44s -> 11926.94s]  Romwell is 45% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[11926.94s -> 11928.02s]  Was it really?
[11928.02s -> 11929.46s]  I mean, I didn't watch the movie
[11929.46s -> 11941.36s]  because I thought it was gonna be a good movie.
[11941.36s -> 11943.32s]  Oh, I also saw the one Lindsay Lohan
[11943.32s -> 11945.36s]  pretends to be pregnant.
[11945.36s -> 11947.06s]  The whole movie.
[11947.06s -> 11948.38s]  I forget what it's called.
[11948.38s -> 11949.42s]  Guys, these are free on YouTube,
[11949.42s -> 11951.22s]  and I'll just load one up for fun in the background.
[11951.22s -> 11956.57s]  Just not even pay attention.
[11956.57s -> 11957.77s]  I don't know, the movie's called, like,
[11957.77s -> 11959.01s]  I'm Expecting or something.
[11959.01s -> 11967.06s]  What's it called?
[11967.06s -> 11976.52s]  Labor Pains, yeah, that's what it's called.
[11976.52s -> 11984.34s]  There's a fight here, hold on.
[11984.34s -> 11989.98s]  Lawn mowing.
[11989.98s -> 11992.89s]  What was the last movie you actually watched?
[11997.47s -> 11998.87s]  I don't know.
[11998.87s -> 12000.23s]  What was the last movie I actually watched?
[12000.23s -> 12012.82s]  I sat down and watched Start to Finish.
[12012.82s -> 12015.83s]  It's, like, so gone from my brain right now.
[12015.83s -> 12017.75s]  The Force Awakens III, what was it called?
[12017.75s -> 12022.73s]  The Sith are always, Eternal Sith, what's it called?
[12022.73s -> 12026.60s]  It was, they all have the same name.
[12026.60s -> 12027.44s]  I'm not gonna look at chat
[12027.44s -> 12029.02s]  because I need to figure this out on my own.
[12029.02s -> 12032.33s]  Star Wars, Attack of the Clones,
[12032.33s -> 12033.93s]  Star Wars The Phantom Menace,
[12033.93s -> 12037.18s]  Star Wars Revenge of the Sith,
[12037.18s -> 12039.25s]  Star Wars A New Hope,
[12039.25s -> 12041.32s]  Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back,
[12041.32s -> 12043.10s]  Star Wars The Return of the Jedi,
[12043.14s -> 12044.54s]  Star Wars The Force Awakens,
[12044.54s -> 12046.10s]  Star Wars The Last Jedi,
[12046.10s -> 12053.77s]  Star Wars The Never-Ending Sith, what is it?
[12053.77s -> 12056.69s]  It's something just like Revenge of the Sith.
[12056.69s -> 12059.00s]  What the fuck is it called?
[12059.00s -> 12060.20s]  I'm not gonna look at chat.
[12060.20s -> 12061.93s]  I'm gonna sit here until I get it
[12061.93s -> 12066.06s]  because this is embarrassing that I don't know this.
[12066.06s -> 12070.64s]  The Way of the Sith, the end of the Sith.
[12070.64s -> 12071.88s]  I don't know the movie.
[12071.88s -> 12078.55s]  Apparently, I don't give a shit about this movie.
[12078.55s -> 12080.47s]  Star Wars The Next Generation.
[12080.47s -> 12084.24s]  No, that's Star Trek.
[12084.24s -> 12085.06s]  I don't know.
[12085.06s -> 12087.16s]  I don't know what the lightest Star Wars movie is
[12087.16s -> 12088.64s]  and it's gonna kill me.
[12088.64s -> 12090.20s]  I am turned around in my chair right now
[12090.20s -> 12094.70s]  to make sure I don't look at the screen.
[12094.70s -> 12097.74s]  Phantom Menace Clone Wars,
[12097.74s -> 12100.46s]  Revenge of the Sith,
[12100.46s -> 12102.32s]  A New Hope,
[12102.32s -> 12103.56s]  Empire Strikes Back,
[12103.56s -> 12105.40s]  Return of the Jedi,
[12105.40s -> 12107.83s]  Force Awakens,
[12107.83s -> 12109.88s]  The Last Jedi,
[12109.88s -> 12113.98s]  and The Last One.
[12113.98s -> 12117.47s]  What is it?
[12117.47s -> 12118.43s]  I can't do it.
[12118.43s -> 12122.26s]  What is it?
[12122.26s -> 12123.58s]  I'm not turning around until I get this.
[12123.58s -> 12129.69s]  This is fucking embarrassing for me.
[12129.69s -> 12131.30s]  The end of the Sith?
[12131.30s -> 12133.92s]  No, the Sith of the,
[12133.92s -> 12135.72s]  the width of the Sith?
[12135.72s -> 12139.46s]  No, that's not it.
[12139.50s -> 12143.43s]  Although that's probably on Pornhub.
[12143.43s -> 12144.27s]  I give up, what is it?
[12144.27s -> 12145.09s]  I have no idea.
[12145.09s -> 12150.14s]  I don't know, what is it?
[12150.14s -> 12150.98s]  I give up.
[12150.98s -> 12155.94s]  What is it?
[12155.94s -> 12156.78s]  I give up.
[12156.78s -> 12157.62s]  Rise of Skywalker.
[12157.62s -> 12160.33s]  Oh my God.
[12160.33s -> 12161.17s]  God.
[12161.17s -> 12166.97s]  How, right.
[12166.97s -> 12169.61s]  The movie was so bad that he forgot it.
[12169.61s -> 12183.15s]  No, it's, ah, whatever.
[12183.15s -> 12184.43s]  I'd like to test out your true fortitude.
[12184.43s -> 12187.77s]  Could you please clean up all the grass?
[12187.77s -> 12189.61s]  As a show of respect for your whimsically good heart,
[12189.61s -> 12191.50s]  I should reward you handsomely.
[12191.50s -> 12193.89s]  But let's be completely honest.
[12193.89s -> 12194.71s]  I don't even,
[12194.71s -> 12197.48s]  if I don't even remember the title of the movie
[12197.48s -> 12200.20s]  and it's in one of the most celebrated franchises ever,
[12200.20s -> 12203.26s]  I probably didn't care that much, right?
[12203.26s -> 12208.60s]  I can't pretend I did.
[12208.60s -> 12212.51s]  All right, let's do another one more.
[12212.51s -> 12214.63s]  Lag X just gave 50 community subs.
[12214.63s -> 12216.41s]  That's insane.
[12216.41s -> 12220.01s]  That's a massive amount of community subs.
[12220.01s -> 12223.48s]  That's hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
[12223.48s -> 12225.72s]  Holy shit.
[12225.72s -> 12227.79s]  Three, two, one.
[12227.79s -> 12229.19s]  Thank you, Lag X.
[12229.19s -> 12230.23s]  That's insane.
[12230.23s -> 12231.07s]  That's a lot of money.
[12231.07s -> 12237.00s]  All right, I'm gonna do this right.
[12237.00s -> 12238.60s]  I really do blame the camera though.
[12238.60s -> 12243.64s]  I'm going to.
[12243.64s -> 12263.49s]  I think doing this like a little spurt, it helps.
[12263.49s -> 12276.01s]  I missed a piece, but all right.
[12276.01s -> 12276.85s]  Next game.
[12276.85s -> 12277.77s]  I'm not doing next game.
[12277.77s -> 12278.61s]  I'm playing this.
[12278.61s -> 12279.45s]  I'm playing Heroes 3, but I've been waiting
[12279.45s -> 12280.37s]  three years for this.
[12280.37s -> 12290.93s]  No, turn, turn, turn.
[12290.93s -> 12304.22s]  Didn't even have to look, but that's good.
[12304.22s -> 12311.02s]  Is there anything higher than gold?
[12311.02s -> 12317.37s]  Thousand, that's it.
[12317.37s -> 12319.63s]  All right, well that's lawn mowing.
[12319.63s -> 12321.68s]  And then I've got this.
[12321.68s -> 12323.58s]  Volume one volunteer mission, sure.
[12334.52s -> 12341.92s]  That was the tutorial.
[12341.92s -> 12350.30s]  Oh my goodness gracious, okay.
[12350.30s -> 12369.94s]  Shit, I didn't know it could overheat.
[12369.94s -> 12384.90s]  Only three minutes.
[12384.90s -> 12407.16s]  I got plenty of time, I'm good.
[12407.16s -> 12408.36s]  I hate turning that camera.
[12408.36s -> 12419.03s]  Camera's the worst, damn it.
[12419.03s -> 12420.19s]  I wish that just turned with you.
[12420.19s -> 12424.38s]  Why do I have to use my other right stick to turn too?
[12424.38s -> 12441.64s]  Oh, fuck you.
[12442.64s -> 12447.62s]  Oh God, give me a break.
[12447.62s -> 12455.54s]  That was not clean, but I'll take the money.
[12455.54s -> 12457.10s]  Using turn signals with a mower.
[12457.10s -> 12459.93s]  Bronze, yuck.
[12459.93s -> 12472.11s]  I don't care.
[12472.11s -> 12475.37s]  New level has been unlocked.
[12475.37s -> 12477.54s]  Be cool.
[12477.54s -> 12478.66s]  All right, new level unlocked.
[12478.66s -> 12482.44s]  It's probably later on.
[12482.44s -> 12489.72s]  There's a toilet over here.
[12489.72s -> 12494.99s]  Oh my goodness.
[12494.99s -> 12497.57s]  Have you ever mowed a lawn in real life?
[12497.57s -> 12501.14s]  Yes, many, many times.
[12501.14s -> 12504.42s]  When I'm mowing the lawn, I don't turn my head backwards
[12504.42s -> 12508.95s]  and use my left and right thumbs to turn.
[12508.95s -> 12513.19s]  Oh, excuse me.
[12513.19s -> 12514.27s]  Where is this?
[12514.27s -> 12523.21s]  Where's this toilet?
[12524.13s -> 12525.29s]  This game blows and it really doesn't.
[12525.29s -> 12536.60s]  I assure you.
[12536.60s -> 12537.44s]  All right.
[12544.81s -> 12545.65s]  Where is it?
[12565.32s -> 12575.09s]  Fuck the haters, no.
[12575.09s -> 12581.67s]  Cereal shitter.
[12581.67s -> 12584.89s]  Oh, the recording thing.
[12584.89s -> 12587.89s]  So confused by that.
[12587.89s -> 12592.04s]  We'll save the game.
[12592.04s -> 12596.38s]  No more heroes is if someone turned the combo's pizza snacks
[12596.38s -> 12597.64s]  into a video game.
[12597.64s -> 12599.50s]  Why do I know what you mean?
[12599.50s -> 12600.52s]  I, yeah, I get it.
[12600.52s -> 12610.20s]  Yeah, that's true.
[12610.20s -> 12612.12s]  It's such a weird thing to understand,
[12612.12s -> 12617.70s]  but I know what that means.
[12617.70s -> 12625.30s]  It's over here.
[12625.30s -> 12627.02s]  By the way, I can't find those anymore.
[12627.02s -> 12629.08s]  You know what else I can't find?
[12629.08s -> 12631.78s]  This is really starting to agitate me.
[12631.78s -> 12632.84s]  Pretzel goldfish.
[12632.84s -> 12633.68s]  What happened to them?
[12633.68s -> 12635.70s]  Where are they?
[12635.70s -> 12639.78s]  I can't find them anywhere.
[12639.78s -> 12648.30s]  Have you noticed that?
[12648.30s -> 12652.54s]  Those are my favorites.
[12652.54s -> 12653.62s]  They still exist here.
[12653.62s -> 12655.58s]  I feel like there's like a few places in the world
[12655.58s -> 12656.42s]  or in the country or something
[12656.42s -> 12660.05s]  that are not getting the supply or something.
[12660.05s -> 12661.45s]  All right, you have the driving skills of a true champion.
[12661.45s -> 12663.86s]  Could you possibly entertain a request?
[12663.86s -> 12666.46s]  These vulgar thugs only able to follow their flock
[12666.46s -> 12668.50s]  have been utterly terrorizing the highway.
[12669.22s -> 12671.30s]  The day my grandmother was on her way to work
[12671.30s -> 12673.62s]  when these cretins almost ran her off the road.
[12673.62s -> 12676.30s]  It was probably me.
[12676.30s -> 12677.42s]  I absolutely cannot abide.
[12677.42s -> 12681.41s]  Please put these criminals in their place.
[12681.41s -> 12684.05s]  Destroy the head runaway car before time runs out.
[12684.05s -> 12686.80s]  Destroy the followers to extend the time limit.
[12686.80s -> 12694.02s]  Don't hit normal cars.
[12694.02s -> 12694.84s]  There's actually a,
[12694.84s -> 12699.05s]  there's a pretzel goldfish shortage.
[12699.05s -> 12706.46s]  It's really sad.
[12706.46s -> 12710.14s]  Okay, accelerate, brake, boost.
[12710.14s -> 12713.41s]  Do I have to smash into them?
[12713.41s -> 12722.74s]  What?
[12726.39s -> 12735.22s]  Holy shit, I'm going too fast.
[12735.22s -> 12742.93s]  Those gems.
[12742.93s -> 12743.77s]  I'm so close.
[12744.65s -> 12758.42s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[12758.42s -> 12759.62s]  So avoid the cars coming this way.
[12759.62s -> 12768.44s]  That's all I have to do.
[12768.44s -> 12769.64s]  Shit.
[12769.64s -> 12770.48s]  This is, you know what?
[12770.48s -> 12772.64s]  This is the stupid toad level in Mario Kart.
[12772.64s -> 12775.40s]  The highway toads, whatever it's called.
[12775.40s -> 12776.92s]  That's my least favorite Mario Kart level
[12776.92s -> 12780.40s]  in the entire 30 years span of that entire series.
[12780.40s -> 12781.24s]  I hate that level.
[12781.24s -> 12791.18s]  It looks stupid.
[12791.18s -> 12801.95s]  All the toads driving the wrong side of the road.
[12801.95s -> 12805.38s]  Come here.
[12805.38s -> 12811.38s]  Come here.
[12811.38s -> 12822.12s]  There he is.
[12822.12s -> 12833.05s]  Silver, that's fine.
[12833.05s -> 12834.05s]  Make a funny sound.
[12834.05s -> 12836.25s]  I just did.
[12836.25s -> 12838.37s]  I just did the toad finish.
[12838.37s -> 12839.21s]  You just heard it.
[12839.21s -> 12840.03s]  I just did it.
[12840.03s -> 12844.94s]  You just got a funny sound.
[12844.94s -> 12845.98s]  That wasn't funny.
[12850.08s -> 12853.50s]  The whole world doesn't drive on the wrong side of the road.
[12853.50s -> 12859.04s]  But where, okay, but our toad is toads in England?
[12859.04s -> 12874.80s]  Toadville in like Europe?
[12874.80s -> 12876.28s]  Japanese.
[12876.28s -> 12880.01s]  Doesn't Japan drive on the right side of the road?
[12880.01s -> 12883.26s]  I thought Japan drives on the right side of the road.
[12883.26s -> 12886.48s]  There's one or two other countries on earth that do that.
[12886.48s -> 12887.32s]  Where is it?
[12887.32s -> 12891.00s]  Singapore?
[12891.00s -> 12891.84s]  Is it Japan?
[12891.84s -> 12894.64s]  Who does it?
[12894.64s -> 12904.04s]  South Africa, the United States.
[12904.04s -> 12904.96s]  No, I'm serious.
[12904.96s -> 12907.27s]  It's more than a few countries.
[12907.27s -> 12917.16s]  Well, who drives on the right side of the road?
[12917.28s -> 12919.88s]  USA, China, Russia.
[12919.88s -> 12920.76s]  Japan too, right?
[12920.76s -> 12926.72s]  No, not Japan.
[12926.72s -> 12927.92s]  Mexico does, yeah.
[12927.92s -> 12934.30s]  All of South America.
[12934.30s -> 12936.30s]  Japan drives on the left side.
[12936.30s -> 12938.94s]  Well, I haven't seen a Japanese movie in a long time.
[12938.94s -> 12947.50s]  So I don't know anything about Japan apparently.
[12947.50s -> 12950.50s]  Most countries do drive on the right.
[12950.50s -> 12953.18s]  I'm thinking of like the metric system
[12953.18s -> 12954.76s]  versus empirical, right?
[12956.08s -> 12957.32s]  Who is it?
[12957.32s -> 12958.44s]  I got it wrong.
[12958.44s -> 12960.24s]  I'm thinking of like the metric system.
[12960.24s -> 12968.12s]  Who uses empirical?
[12968.12s -> 12973.48s]  Imper, whatever, whatever it's called.
[12973.48s -> 12974.32s]  Who uses it?
[12974.32s -> 12977.76s]  It's the United States and like three other countries.
[12981.86s -> 12982.70s]  I'm not drunk.
[12982.70s -> 12988.99s]  No, I'm not.
[12988.99s -> 12998.04s]  It's the US and Myanmar.
[12998.04s -> 12999.32s]  Okay, let's go.
[12999.32s -> 13001.39s]  How much money do I need?
[13001.39s -> 13007.30s]  Shit.
[13007.30s -> 13009.40s]  I need $25,000.
[13009.40s -> 13014.89s]  How much do I have now?
[13014.89s -> 13027.25s]  I gotta turn around.
[13027.25s -> 13029.25s]  Dude's got a garlic aioli brain.
[13029.25s -> 13037.43s]  No, oh my God.
[13037.43s -> 13047.20s]  There's a toilet over here.
[13047.20s -> 13052.28s]  Let's make some money.
[13052.28s -> 13054.32s]  This game is, this game's tight, it is.
[13054.32s -> 13057.90s]  This game is awesome.
[13057.90s -> 13058.74s]  Where are these missions?
[13058.74s -> 13068.21s]  This one's like over here.
[13068.21s -> 13072.23s]  Hello.
[13072.23s -> 13077.15s]  You eat raw cloves, admit it.
[13077.15s -> 13079.79s]  I mean, look, I don't wanna tell people
[13079.79s -> 13083.91s]  to eat raw cloves of garlic because it's really, really harsh.
[13083.91s -> 13086.11s]  I already did this shit like three days ago.
[13086.11s -> 13089.18s]  I'm not gonna go over this again.
[13089.18s -> 13090.90s]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, garlic.
[13090.90s -> 13092.38s]  When you crush garlic, allicin comes out
[13092.38s -> 13095.74s]  and when you cook garlic, it gets rid of a lot of the allicin.
[13095.74s -> 13102.74s]  I don't know, we don't have to go over this again.
[13102.74s -> 13105.94s]  It's actually, eating raw garlic is really intense
[13105.94s -> 13109.06s]  and I do not really recommend people do that.
[13109.06s -> 13114.38s]  But, you know, just I'm telling you.
[13114.38s -> 13115.82s]  Pickled garlic is really good.
[13115.82s -> 13118.08s]  Garlic, anything is good.
[13118.08s -> 13121.65s]  I love that shit so much, you have no idea.
[13121.65s -> 13123.94s]  Empty cans littered everywhere.
[13123.94s -> 13128.46s]  He's going to dispose of all the garbage.
[13128.46s -> 13131.50s]  Pick up all the empty cans.
[13143.51s -> 13146.31s]  Okay, press the A button to pick up trash.
[13146.31s -> 13147.71s]  If you're attacked by an alligator,
[13147.71s -> 13150.21s]  press the button displayed on the screen.
[13150.21s -> 13167.09s]  Uh, watch out for alligators.
[13167.09s -> 13170.46s]  Crash, crash, I couldn't even read what that said.
[13170.46s -> 13172.66s]  That was an A upside down.
[13172.66s -> 13174.82s]  That was an upside down A.
[13174.82s -> 13180.34s]  I can't, this is hard.
[13180.34s -> 13190.60s]  That's what I know, but like it looked like a fucking A.
[13190.60s -> 13196.30s]  Where's the rest of the trash?
[13196.30s -> 13204.34s]  Crash, I don't see anymore, where's it?
[13204.34s -> 13211.49s]  Where's the pieces of trash?
[13211.53s -> 13217.24s]  There's no trash left.
[13217.24s -> 13223.62s]  I don't see any trash, that's, okay.
[13223.62s -> 13229.20s]  Ugh, listen, this is why I'm going to go
[13229.20s -> 13230.36s]  on a fucking rant here.
[13230.36s -> 13232.63s]  I'm going to go on a huge rant.
[13232.63s -> 13233.91s]  I don't know if people are going to think I'm an idiot
[13233.91s -> 13236.02s]  and stupid and whatever.
[13236.02s -> 13238.78s]  Why, there should have been a goddamn Congress law
[13238.78s -> 13241.46s]  that all video game consoles should just have
[13241.46s -> 13244.44s]  the same letters and same button mappings.
[13244.44s -> 13246.54s]  But they're like face buttons.
[13246.54s -> 13250.86s]  Cause like Xbox, X is where the Y is.
[13250.86s -> 13252.42s]  B is where the A is.
[13253.38s -> 13254.22s]  Triangle is where the X is.
[13254.22s -> 13256.06s]  If you play all the consoles equally,
[13256.06s -> 13260.58s]  I play all consoles equally, all of them.
[13260.58s -> 13265.18s]  When I put into muscle memory where A is on Xbox One,
[13265.18s -> 13267.87s]  that is where A is on Switch.
[13267.87s -> 13269.99s]  There should be a goddamn Congress law
[13269.99s -> 13272.81s]  that states that has to be there.
[13272.81s -> 13273.65s]  And that's not even important,
[13273.65s -> 13275.01s]  it's a literally first world problem
[13275.01s -> 13286.21s]  and nobody really cares, do it again.
[13286.21s -> 13288.83s]  But that's my only defense.
[13288.83s -> 13293.86s]  Is when I see Y on the screen, I press Y on Xbox.
[13293.86s -> 13295.82s]  If I see X on screen, I might press X
[13295.82s -> 13297.54s]  where it is on PlayStation.
[13298.50s -> 13300.58s]  It's wherever my muscle memory of my brain
[13300.58s -> 13302.93s]  decides to go for that moment.
[13302.93s -> 13304.57s]  Unless you play on one console, obviously,
[13304.57s -> 13305.85s]  then you're not gonna have this problem at all.
[13305.85s -> 13314.18s]  But you know, whatever.
[13314.18s -> 13315.46s]  It's usually the last console
[13315.46s -> 13317.02s]  that I spent the most time with.
[13317.02s -> 13320.17s]  So I was playing a lot of Xbox before this
[13320.17s -> 13323.45s]  and I use my Xbox controller on PC all the time.
[13323.45s -> 13329.80s]  So, and where is the rest of the trash?
[13329.80s -> 13334.94s]  Am I freaking out here?
[13334.94s -> 13343.65s]  You see that?
[13343.65s -> 13347.46s]  Rotate, the camera wouldn't rotate anymore after that.
[13347.46s -> 13348.98s]  I was literally trying to rotate the camera
[13348.98s -> 13350.38s]  and it wouldn't rotate any further
[13350.38s -> 13355.95s]  to see the other side, I promise you.
[13355.95s -> 13363.29s]  Play the seal video, I already did it.
[13363.29s -> 13377.58s]  Hey, is it tutorial again?
[13377.58s -> 13385.66s]  I wanna do the actual mission, there we go.
[13385.66s -> 13388.55s]  Play it again, I will in a minute.
[13406.30s -> 13408.70s]  Why, fuck, that's not why, that's Xbox Y.
[13408.70s -> 13425.75s]  I just pressed the up button, the top one.
[13425.75s -> 13443.71s]  I get it, it changed the layout.
[13443.71s -> 13445.15s]  I feel like I would do the reverse problem.
[13445.15s -> 13446.11s]  I would start overthinking it
[13446.11s -> 13448.79s]  and try to hit buttons that were,
[13448.79s -> 13461.74s]  it says X on screen, I'll press the right one that time.
[13461.78s -> 13477.62s]  60 seconds, wait till it gets ported to PC.
[13479.90s -> 13496.58s]  Nobody tell them, nobody's gonna tell them.
[13496.58s -> 13506.35s]  Just emulate it with a switch emulator.
[13506.35s -> 13518.25s]  I don't think that makes it, I don't think those exist.
[13518.25s -> 13519.81s]  The thing is, I don't think I would ever emulate anything
[13519.81s -> 13524.94s]  on the current gen because it's available to just play.
[13524.94s -> 13530.37s]  The problem with emulate, oh my God, I have nine seconds left.
[13530.37s -> 13534.30s]  I don't know where it is, it's right there.
[13534.30s -> 13538.25s]  Ah, I have 0.4 seconds to press A.
[13538.37s -> 13541.53s]  Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[13541.53s -> 13543.76s]  Did I get it?
[13543.76s -> 13554.07s]  Got it.
[13554.07s -> 13555.03s]  What was I saying?
[13556.38s -> 13557.58s]  Oh, right, right, right.
[13557.58s -> 13561.10s]  So the reason why emulation is something
[13561.10s -> 13563.54s]  that I have done in the past, right,
[13563.54s -> 13568.21s]  is because sometimes you just can't get access to anything.
[13568.21s -> 13570.45s]  Even when I play a game from like 20 years ago
[13570.45s -> 13573.36s]  that is never gonna get released ever again,
[13573.36s -> 13575.48s]  that you may even have in a closet,
[13575.48s -> 13579.69s]  up in your attic or whatever.
[13579.69s -> 13584.94s]  It's just, it's impossible to ever do it again.
[13584.94s -> 13587.06s]  And like, I'm gonna, okay, I'm gonna take a shot
[13588.06s -> 13590.26s]  at Nintendo here.
[13590.26s -> 13592.90s]  You don't solve that problem by releasing
[13592.90s -> 13594.98s]  like one Super Nintendo game a week
[13594.98s -> 13599.47s]  that nobody gives a shit about on like the Switch Online.
[13599.47s -> 13602.07s]  Like, oh, new Super Nintendo games available.
[13602.07s -> 13605.39s]  It's like one or two, it's like every like week or two.
[13605.39s -> 13610.24s]  Not even, sometimes it's like once a month.
[13610.24s -> 13612.72s]  It's like you, like I would actually pay for this.
[13612.72s -> 13615.31s]  I really would.
[13615.31s -> 13616.79s]  And I understand like, oh, but we don't want to just
[13616.79s -> 13617.95s]  dump everything on.
[13617.95s -> 13621.47s]  I would pay a very hefty, more than like Netflix fee.
[13622.03s -> 13625.33s]  I would pay a Netflix style fee
[13625.33s -> 13627.49s]  if they just dumped whatever they were able
[13627.49s -> 13631.27s]  to actually license still.
[13631.27s -> 13632.11s]  Just give us everything.
[13632.11s -> 13635.03s]  I'll pay a monthly fee for it.
[13635.03s -> 13640.78s]  I want to play the games and I will pay for it.
[13640.78s -> 13645.90s]  But like, well, there's like 31 games on the Switch Online
[13645.90s -> 13650.39s]  and you know, maybe we'll, maybe you'll get like Rygar.
[13650.39s -> 13656.10s]  Okay, yeah, I guess.
[13656.10s -> 13657.46s]  I don't want to rent, I want to own.
[13657.46s -> 13659.64s]  I will pay for these games.
[13659.64s -> 13661.12s]  Yeah, they had the virtual console
[13661.12s -> 13662.28s]  and everybody like loved it.
[13662.28s -> 13664.08s]  And then there was probably some licensing problem
[13664.08s -> 13665.08s]  to bring it over, right?
[13665.08s -> 13670.28s]  But still, I would pay more than what I pay for Netflix.
[13670.28s -> 13671.48s]  They have access to like every
[13671.48s -> 13674.40s]  available licensed regular Nintendo game.
[13674.40s -> 13675.80s]  And they wonder why people like emulate it.
[13675.80s -> 13679.07s]  That's the why, is they want to play.
[13679.07s -> 13680.91s]  You talk, look at the younger audience, right?
[13680.91s -> 13682.92s]  The younger kids.
[13682.92s -> 13685.11s]  They hear all these stories.
[13685.11s -> 13686.43s]  Oh my God, you have no idea.
[13686.43s -> 13689.35s]  Super Mario One, Super Mario Two, Super Mario Three.
[13689.35s -> 13692.43s]  No, you didn't play, you didn't play Unicycle.
[13692.43s -> 13693.39s]  That game was amazing.
[13693.63s -> 13695.79s]  The Unicycle racing game for the Super Nintendo.
[13695.79s -> 13699.25s]  You idiot Zoomer, you have no idea how good it was.
[13699.25s -> 13700.97s]  I want to play.
[13700.97s -> 13703.50s]  Oh, you're never going to get a chance.
[13703.50s -> 13709.53s]  Like they want to have those experiences.
[13709.53s -> 13711.25s]  Dude, I remember Clay Fighter.
[13711.25s -> 13712.81s]  Yeah, me and my like 30 year old buddy
[13712.81s -> 13713.97s]  are talking about Clay Fighter.
[13713.97s -> 13715.61s]  Oh, Frosty the Snowman, it was awesome.
[13715.61s -> 13718.09s]  Purr, purr, purr, hurt, hurt, hurt.
[13718.09s -> 13720.49s]  Oh, I loved, Taffy, it was awesome.
[13720.49s -> 13722.89s]  Was that this guy that, this kid's like 19
[13722.89s -> 13724.49s]  where you didn't play it?
[13724.49s -> 13725.77s]  Good luck, idiot.
[13725.77s -> 13726.93s]  We loved it, we played it.
[13726.93s -> 13729.32s]  Don't you wish you had an experience like us?
[13729.96s -> 13730.80s]  They kind of do, they want to play it.
[13730.80s -> 13734.51s]  They would love to do it.
[13734.51s -> 13737.57s]  So like they have to find a way to play it, right?
[13737.57s -> 13751.41s]  It's not rocket science.
[13751.41s -> 13753.45s]  And I don't know, but like punishing like,
[13753.45s -> 13757.77s]  I don't have like a reason to go get Clay Fighter
[13757.77s -> 13758.77s]  for the Super Nintendo.
[13758.77s -> 13762.95s]  Like I don't, or like Clay Fighter 63 and third, whatever.
[13762.95s -> 13764.03s]  So I already experienced that.
[13764.03s -> 13766.49s]  I played it a shitload when I was younger.
[13766.49s -> 13767.73s]  And if we're going to hold these games
[13767.73s -> 13771.25s]  to this like really high, almost like gatekeep standard
[13772.13s -> 13775.42s]  to like the younger gamers,
[13775.46s -> 13777.26s]  they should be able to play it.
[13777.26s -> 13778.54s]  They should have an opportunity to play it
[13778.54s -> 13789.78s]  without having it being illegal.
[13789.78s -> 13797.45s]  That's just what I think.
[13797.45s -> 13799.53s]  Why is it being illegal stopping you?
[13799.53s -> 13802.53s]  Well, I'm not saying it is, but the fact that like you,
[13802.53s -> 13807.03s]  look, going and getting like an emulator
[13807.03s -> 13809.27s]  and downloading ROMs and shit,
[13809.27s -> 13810.99s]  it's like you'd nobody, people like actually kind of
[13810.99s -> 13813.23s]  don't really want to do that.
[13813.23s -> 13814.07s]  Like a young audience.
[13814.07s -> 13817.15s]  Like if you're talking, like when I was like 13, 14, 15,
[13817.15s -> 13817.99s]  oh, what you got to do, you got to go
[13817.99s -> 13818.83s]  with this piece of software.
[13818.83s -> 13819.95s]  You got to go get this ROM.
[13819.95s -> 13820.95s]  You got to drag the ROM into here.
[13820.95s -> 13821.95s]  By the way, hit escape.
[13821.95s -> 13822.79s]  And you have to do a configure
[13822.79s -> 13824.27s]  a bunch of fucked up video settings.
[13824.27s -> 13825.95s]  And oh, by the way, maybe the ROM doesn't work.
[13825.95s -> 13828.51s]  Oh, maybe, but I can't feel like viruses and shit.
[13828.51s -> 13836.24s]  It's like, it's just, it's just troublesome.
[13836.24s -> 13837.56s]  It's not the same experience.
[13837.56s -> 13841.57s]  Yeah, and look, I am forever grateful
[13841.57s -> 13844.25s]  to the people that were able to kind of archive
[13844.25s -> 13847.58s]  a lot of this stuff.
[13847.58s -> 13848.66s]  Because without emulation,
[13848.66s -> 13851.14s]  without people doing ROMs and emulation,
[13851.14s -> 13852.54s]  and having to be like a real passionate thing
[13852.54s -> 13854.22s]  that people did, we probably wouldn't be able
[13854.22s -> 13857.36s]  to even have half of these things.
[13857.36s -> 13858.56s]  We wouldn't be able to even care
[13858.56s -> 13865.82s]  about half of these franchises, I don't think.
[13865.82s -> 13867.18s]  All right, what do I need?
[13867.18s -> 13870.14s]  Get C rank or higher in one defense mission.
[13870.14s -> 13870.98s]  I did it already.
[13870.98s -> 13873.38s]  Otaku Freak is the name of this item.
[13876.30s -> 13889.65s]  I guess I'll put it on, okay.
[13889.65s -> 13891.81s]  But here's the thing, I'm also not naive enough
[13891.81s -> 13896.29s]  to say that, oh, just put all 700 Super Nintendo games
[13896.29s -> 13900.58s]  up on the Super Nintendo online Switch thing.
[13900.58s -> 13902.58s]  Like there's licensing deals.
[13902.58s -> 13904.22s]  There's like music that probably was
[13904.22s -> 13905.70s]  in some of those games that they can never
[13905.70s -> 13907.58s]  like actually release ever again.
[13908.46s -> 13911.46s]  I do, but it'd be nice to see like a real actual effort
[13911.46s -> 13924.61s]  to really put on a bunch of stuff that they can put on.
[13924.61s -> 13928.61s]  Like Super Mario RPG can't be released easily again.
[13928.61s -> 13940.53s]  Right, isn't that a huge reason why we're never gonna see
[13940.53s -> 13943.16s]  Turtles in Time?
[13943.16s -> 13948.16s]  Probably, but who stands, I hate, okay, here we go.
[13948.48s -> 13949.88s]  You ready?
[13949.88s -> 13953.44s]  Who stands to gain from that?
[13953.44s -> 13955.76s]  They're not selling copies of Turtles in Time
[13955.76s -> 13958.52s]  really anymore, they remade it, right?
[13958.52s -> 13960.72s]  Didn't they like redo like Turtles in Time
[13960.72s -> 13962.68s]  or like a version of it?
[13962.68s -> 13963.68s]  They made like a new beat-em-up
[13963.68s -> 13965.44s]  like five or six years ago, right?
[13967.02s -> 13968.54s]  They're not selling Turtles in Time anymore.
[13968.54s -> 13971.66s]  Like, I don't know, I just don't understand why.
[13971.66s -> 13973.26s]  It's such an awesome piece of media
[13973.26s -> 13975.94s]  that people should be able to enjoy.
[13975.94s -> 13977.16s]  And even if they were to get it together
[13977.16s -> 13979.46s]  and like charge for it again, like a few bucks or something,
[13979.46s -> 13981.22s]  whatever, that's fine.
[13981.22s -> 13983.60s]  But just to like delete this shit from all history
[13983.60s -> 13986.06s]  and say, don't ever look at it ever again.
[13986.06s -> 13986.90s]  Don't look at it.
[13986.90s -> 13989.77s]  If you look at it, then it's illegal.
[13989.85s -> 13991.05s]  But like, I mean, it was awesome.
[13991.05s -> 13996.72s]  I like wanna look at it.
[13996.72s -> 14000.93s]  You can't like, okay, you can't like have the Picasso
[14000.93s -> 14004.60s]  be a painting that existed.
[14004.60s -> 14006.78s]  And then you like put the Picasso behind a fucking,
[14006.78s -> 14009.27s]  like a black screen,
[14009.27s -> 14015.84s]  just because it's fucking like more than 100 years old.
[14015.84s -> 14018.64s]  Well, you see, oh, I wanna come see,
[14018.64s -> 14021.04s]  I wanna come see all Picasso's paintings.
[14021.04s -> 14024.03s]  Well, see, there's an issue there.
[14024.03s -> 14026.90s]  You can't look at them anymore.
[14026.90s -> 14028.30s]  Why not?
[14028.30s -> 14030.84s]  Well, because it's been a pretty long time
[14030.84s -> 14032.52s]  and we just kinda don't feel like
[14032.52s -> 14035.18s]  showing it to anybody anymore.
[14035.18s -> 14036.28s]  So what about, can I,
[14036.28s -> 14040.38s]  but there's images of Picasso's paintings online.
[14040.38s -> 14043.59s]  You look at them, you're going to fucking jail.
[14043.59s -> 14046.86s]  Okay, thanks.
[14046.86s -> 14048.64s]  Appreciate, I guess I get,
[14048.64s -> 14051.42s]  my like older, like 35 year old boomer friend
[14051.42s -> 14065.26s]  will tell me how cool they were.
[14065.26s -> 14074.38s]  All right, I'll rant over.
[14074.38s -> 14075.96s]  Don't give him any ideas.
[14075.96s -> 14078.51s]  All right, what am I actually supposed to be doing right now?
[14078.51s -> 14080.07s]  I've lost all control of the stream.
[14080.07s -> 14081.37s]  What was I doing?
[14081.37s -> 14086.37s]  Okay, ATM, I gotta make 25,000 utopia coins.
[14087.65s -> 14092.00s]  So let's go do a mission.
[14092.00s -> 14093.48s]  Get on the highway and head to the thunder dome.
[14093.48s -> 14107.20s]  Okay, friends with 35 guy,
[14107.20s -> 14109.40s]  friends with older 35 year old.
[14109.40s -> 14112.31s]  No, I'm just saying, like,
[14112.31s -> 14114.25s]  you get to watch like YouTube videos
[14114.25s -> 14117.05s]  of dickheads like me telling you,
[14117.05s -> 14122.95s]  oh my God, and it was the coolest thing ever.
[14122.95s -> 14125.43s]  It was the best experience ever.
[14125.43s -> 14132.83s]  It was so fun.
[14132.87s -> 14155.42s]  I said rant over, I know.
[14155.42s -> 14162.06s]  I love the weekly rants, keep it up.
[14162.06s -> 14170.14s]  Ooh, something right here.
[14170.14s -> 14172.32s]  Where is it?
[14172.32s -> 14180.04s]  ATM, wait, where's the, there it is.
[14180.04s -> 14180.96s]  Oh, it's the rant.
[14181.96s -> 14184.18s]  I can't say that.
[14184.18s -> 14185.02s]  Those are facts.
[14185.02s -> 14185.98s]  Oh, there's Twitch here.
[14185.98s -> 14186.82s]  Twitch dev, what's going on?
[14186.82s -> 14192.14s]  Hello.
[14192.14s -> 14193.86s]  Wesson mining is dangerous and can prove fatal.
[14193.86s -> 14195.54s]  No one ever returns.
[14195.54s -> 14196.82s]  I'd like to test out your true fortitude.
[14196.82s -> 14200.27s]  Could you please take over Wesson mining in the cave?
[14200.27s -> 14215.06s]  All right, mining, it's Bonzi buddy.
[14215.06s -> 14217.12s]  It is.
[14217.12s -> 14219.00s]  Okay, dig up Wesson before the time runs out.
[14219.00s -> 14222.30s]  Just swing the pickaxe, run around in mine.
[14233.38s -> 14234.22s]  Did I get it?
[14234.22s -> 14236.16s]  I got it, okay, go.
[14236.16s -> 14237.00s]  Shut up.
[14243.08s -> 14245.34s]  Okay, I got to count how many times it takes to do it.
[14247.86s -> 14248.70s]  It's lava.
[14251.20s -> 14252.78s]  Like, can I go over here?
[14252.78s -> 14253.62s]  No, where is it?
[14253.62s -> 14254.76s]  Is that it?
[14254.76s -> 14255.76s]  It's two out of two.
[14255.76s -> 14258.54s]  How do I leave?
[14258.54s -> 14259.38s]  Is that it?
[14268.16s -> 14269.00s]  Yeah!
[14269.00s -> 14282.22s]  Tutorial, oh, okay, okay.
[14282.22s -> 14285.62s]  I heard you talk shit about Nintendo.
[14285.62s -> 14288.22s]  I'm not talking shit about Nintendo.
[14288.22s -> 14293.58s]  I'm just bringing up a point.
[14293.58s -> 14297.79s]  I'm playing on a Nintendo console right now.
[14297.79s -> 14299.71s]  But here's another part two to this.
[14299.71s -> 14301.99s]  This is a really important part two.
[14301.99s -> 14303.15s]  I think we don't think too much
[14303.15s -> 14306.27s]  about this particular part two.
[14306.27s -> 14309.98s]  What happens in another 50 years, 100 years?
[14309.98s -> 14313.82s]  What happens in 30 years when like 10 more consoles are out?
[14313.82s -> 14315.06s]  Does this all just disappear,
[14315.06s -> 14317.68s]  all this shit that we've done?
[14317.68s -> 14321.25s]  We have to like preserve this stuff,
[14321.25s -> 14325.26s]  otherwise it just goes away.
[14333.54s -> 14334.82s]  Dude, there are people that like,
[14334.82s -> 14337.30s]  they turn off like the servers to play games sometimes.
[14337.30s -> 14340.50s]  Like all these, that's like the big proponents against
[14340.50s -> 14346.41s]  always online games, right?
[14346.41s -> 14356.42s]  What happened?
[14356.42s -> 14357.54s]  Well, let's try that again.
[14357.54s -> 14367.34s]  You can fall in the lava.
[14367.34s -> 14369.18s]  Look at the seal video.
[14369.18s -> 14373.43s]  No, no, I refuse.
[14377.00s -> 14379.49s]  You mined straight down.
[14379.49s -> 14380.61s]  Yeah, kind of.
[14380.61s -> 14382.09s]  All right, well, I'm gonna go this way.
[14389.74s -> 14396.84s]  Watch out for the fire.
[14396.84s -> 14397.68s]  What happened?
[14397.68s -> 14399.24s]  I have to fight enemies in here too?
[14399.24s -> 14400.24s]  What the fuck?
[14403.07s -> 14404.07s]  I'm so confused.
[14429.27s -> 14436.75s]  Grab.
[14438.63s -> 14441.84s]  I gotta remember how to get the hell out of here.
[14445.48s -> 14446.32s]  This is two.
[14446.32s -> 14449.44s]  Two heavy hits and that's it.
[14449.44s -> 14450.76s]  Seven, two out of seven.
[14456.45s -> 14457.89s]  This is gonna be my least favorite one.
[14457.89s -> 14460.48s]  I'm gonna get so lost here.
[14460.48s -> 14461.32s]  Aye, aye, aye.
[14464.68s -> 14466.24s]  Get it.
[14466.24s -> 14475.34s]  Oh my fucking God, this sucks.
[14475.34s -> 14481.90s]  Same exact place.
[14481.90s -> 14482.74s]  I'm gonna try this one more time,
[14482.74s -> 14484.79s]  then I don't even care.
[14484.79s -> 14485.83s]  This is level one.
[14498.72s -> 14499.56s]  Okay.
[14505.37s -> 14506.29s]  I'm gonna go left.
[14506.29s -> 14507.73s]  Wait for this fire to go.
[14507.73s -> 14508.57s]  I can jump.
[14509.05s -> 14510.81s]  I just jumped in the, whatever.
[14510.81s -> 14511.77s]  You all saw what happened.
[14511.77s -> 14513.45s]  I don't need to tell you what happened.
[14522.77s -> 14523.69s]  These missions are tough
[14523.69s -> 14527.79s]  because they have to actually fight them too.
[14527.79s -> 14528.63s]  I don't know where I am,
[14528.63s -> 14529.47s]  but I apparently...
[14539.74s -> 14540.58s]  No.
[14546.16s -> 14548.08s]  Pretty good dodges in this fight corridor though,
[14548.08s -> 14548.92s]  I will say.
[14552.78s -> 14554.34s]  No seal, no meal.
[14554.34s -> 14555.70s]  I'll show the video again.
[14555.70s -> 14556.94s]  I'll play it again.
[14556.94s -> 14563.82s]  Get the fuck out.
[14563.82s -> 14564.66s]  And dig.
[14564.86s -> 14566.70s]  How are you?
[14566.70s -> 14572.49s]  It's two heavy, one normal.
[14572.49s -> 14579.13s]  It's two heavy.
[14579.13s -> 14580.13s]  What the fuck?
[14589.20s -> 14593.33s]  Gonna explode and...
[14593.33s -> 14595.75s]  Shut up.
[14595.75s -> 14598.03s]  I'm gonna see, is it three swings maybe?
[14598.03s -> 14599.99s]  Three normal swings and then one.
[14599.99s -> 14605.38s]  I gotta get a good rhythm here.
[14605.38s -> 14607.34s]  It might be one, two, three, three.
[14613.06s -> 14614.02s]  Seal, seal.
[14614.02s -> 14614.86s]  Stop.
[14614.86s -> 14616.62s]  I'll show the seal in like 10 minutes.
[14628.99s -> 14630.23s]  Invincible mode.
[14630.23s -> 14631.07s]  Ooh.
[14632.87s -> 14650.38s]  What's wrong?
[14650.38s -> 14652.42s]  It's gonna be one, two, let's see.
[14654.22s -> 14655.06s]  One, two, three.
[14656.86s -> 14658.74s]  Let's do, two, let's do three.
[14658.74s -> 14660.26s]  Let's do four.
[14660.26s -> 14662.74s]  One, two, three, four.
[14662.74s -> 14664.18s]  Nope, that's a bad strategy.
[14665.51s -> 14667.86s]  We'll do one and then two heavy.
[14667.86s -> 14668.90s]  There's only three more.
[14668.90s -> 14673.34s]  Take it slow, don't be a fucking idiot.
[14673.34s -> 14675.90s]  I'm probably not gone.
[14675.90s -> 14677.42s]  Went down there.
[14677.42s -> 14680.06s]  Haven't gone this way.
[14680.06s -> 14681.02s]  I did go this way though.
[14681.02s -> 14687.69s]  No, not all the way.
[14687.69s -> 14688.73s]  Hey, don't be stupid.
[14688.85s -> 14690.17s]  It's up there.
[14690.17s -> 14691.53s]  What about this way?
[14691.53s -> 14692.37s]  One up there.
[14699.54s -> 14706.00s]  Two more.
[14706.00s -> 14707.20s]  Where's this last one?
[14712.03s -> 14713.43s]  Where's the last one?
[14726.27s -> 14727.47s]  Come on.
[14727.47s -> 14728.31s]  Where is it?
[14735.59s -> 14736.83s]  I gotta leave.
[14736.83s -> 14737.67s]  There's the exit.
[14737.67s -> 14738.51s]  Can I jump?
[14738.51s -> 14750.71s]  Can I make this jump?
[14750.71s -> 14751.63s]  How many noises today?
[14751.63s -> 14761.24s]  Yeah, you're getting a lot of slurps tonight.
[14762.44s -> 14771.26s]  That's for sure.
[14771.26s -> 14772.70s]  All right, 25,000, right?
[14772.70s -> 14775.90s]  I still have to do those missions before the boss.
[14775.90s -> 14782.74s]  So, probably should get over there and start doing this.
[14782.74s -> 14794.60s]  There's actually one over here.
[14794.60s -> 14795.44s]  Seal time.
[14795.44s -> 14808.58s]  Yes, it is.
[14808.58s -> 14811.10s]  Here you go.
[14811.10s -> 14820.06s]  Here's the seal video.
[14820.06s -> 14825.06s]  Five, four, 19, 84, 10, 47, 10, 47.
[14841.39s -> 14842.23s]  Hey, hey.
[14857.15s -> 14864.14s]  This actually might be,
[14864.14s -> 14867.14s]  this actually might be the best video ever
[14867.14s -> 14868.60s]  I've ever seen.
[14868.60s -> 14871.42s]  It's pretty high up there, I think.
[14871.42s -> 14872.26s]  I think it is.
[14879.66s -> 14880.62s]  We can't see?
[14880.62s -> 14884.44s]  Oh, well, you'll just take,
[14884.44s -> 14890.15s]  I can't put it up right this second.
[14890.15s -> 14893.20s]  It's on the subreddit.
[14893.20s -> 14899.18s]  RGerman985 is there.
[14899.18s -> 14900.94s]  If one of the parasites shot up from its mouth
[14900.94s -> 14903.77s]  lashes onto you, you'll be rendered immobile.
[14903.77s -> 14906.71s]  Watch out for the parasite face attack.
[14906.71s -> 14908.31s]  I'm pretty sure I've fought this dude in the tutorial,
[14908.31s -> 14909.15s]  right?
[14909.15s -> 14909.99s]  Okay, bring it on for real this time.
[14909.99s -> 14915.63s]  Show me what you got.
[14915.63s -> 14916.55s]  Get ready.
[14923.24s -> 14924.68s]  Okay, it moves really slowly.
[14926.42s -> 14927.98s]  Because you can't even touch it.
[14927.98s -> 14932.98s]  But I thought it was like a pistol or something.
[14932.98s -> 14933.82s]  Here are the ads.
[14947.18s -> 14957.03s]  All right, let's go.
[14957.03s -> 14957.85s]  What?
[14957.85s -> 14965.91s]  I was in super mode.
[14969.14s -> 14971.18s]  Heavy attacks only, Jeremy.
[14983.50s -> 14985.11s]  Doubt.
[14985.11s -> 14993.50s]  Yeah, this guy is a pain in the ass, isn't he?
[14993.50s -> 14994.78s]  Can I get rid of those?
[14994.78s -> 14997.22s]  Is there any way I can actually kill those things?
[15010.74s -> 15011.58s]  Good toss.
[15013.82s -> 15015.84s]  Again, grab.
[15015.84s -> 15032.38s]  Oh, it didn't work.
[15032.38s -> 15033.22s]  What's that?
[15033.22s -> 15034.04s]  What's that?
[15034.04s -> 15034.88s]  What's that?
[15034.88s -> 15038.22s]  Oh my goodness, that hurt.
[15038.22s -> 15039.06s]  I want to dodge.
[15039.06s -> 15039.88s]  Stop swinging too much.
[15039.88s -> 15040.72s]  You're being greedy.
[15040.72s -> 15043.00s]  Stop it.
[15043.00s -> 15046.21s]  Wait for an opportunity.
[15046.21s -> 15047.49s]  Stop it.
[15047.49s -> 15048.65s]  I have to relax today.
[15050.37s -> 15051.21s]  Here we go.
[15073.13s -> 15073.97s]  Here comes a C rank.
[15073.97s -> 15080.11s]  Yeah, whatever.
[15080.11s -> 15082.08s]  Dodge when it's purple.
[15082.08s -> 15083.76s]  Hey man, it's either just easier said than done though.
[15083.76s -> 15087.49s]  You get like a 10th of a second to make that decision.
[15087.49s -> 15110.66s]  Just be happy they're not Ds.
[15110.66s -> 15112.46s]  Ds what?
[15112.46s -> 15114.63s]  You know.
[15116.74s -> 15117.58s]  There's another one.
[15117.58s -> 15118.40s]  There's another mat.
[15118.40s -> 15120.22s]  There's something right here.
[15120.22s -> 15129.58s]  I'm kind of standing right on top of whatever this is.
[15129.58s -> 15136.23s]  What is it?
[15136.23s -> 15137.99s]  Number 33, take on the defense mission.
[15137.99s -> 15148.24s]  Two waves, yes.
[15148.24s -> 15151.25s]  Are you going to do another royalty free movie night?
[15151.25s -> 15152.09s]  I thought about it,
[15152.09s -> 15160.06s]  but I feel like we've watched the good ones.
[15160.06s -> 15161.22s]  It's two of these Katana guys.
[15161.22s -> 15163.22s]  All right, let's do this right off the bat.
[15175.24s -> 15183.46s]  And get it from behind.
[15183.46s -> 15190.36s]  Grab it.
[15190.36s -> 15201.91s]  Ooh, nice.
[15201.91s -> 15204.25s]  Recommend the second game.
[15204.25s -> 15207.42s]  Um, hold on.
[15207.42s -> 15215.12s]  Can't talk right now.
[15215.12s -> 15228.55s]  Hold on.
[15228.55s -> 15229.39s]  Come here.
[15237.20s -> 15238.64s]  Can't talk while he's focused.
[15238.64s -> 15240.24s]  No, not at all.
[15240.24s -> 15242.56s]  My brain can only focus on one thing at a time.
[15242.56s -> 15257.70s]  Only one, nothing more.
[15257.70s -> 15259.42s]  That should be a B at least, right?
[15259.42s -> 15262.32s]  That's a B.
[15262.32s -> 15263.56s]  That's a B.
[15263.56s -> 15264.40s]  I was wave two.
[15264.40s -> 15265.24s]  Oh my God.
[15265.24s -> 15268.02s]  This harder than that.
[15268.02s -> 15276.48s]  I forget what these guys do.
[15276.48s -> 15277.32s]  Oh my God.
[15277.32s -> 15282.77s]  I forget these guys explode.
[15282.77s -> 15286.68s]  I got to activate these.
[15286.68s -> 15287.52s]  Ow.
[15287.52s -> 15289.11s]  Be careful.
[15289.11s -> 15289.95s]  Holy shit.
[15305.08s -> 15305.92s]  What's my opinion on sardines?
[15305.92s -> 15318.91s]  Love them.
[15318.91s -> 15322.95s]  No.
[15322.95s -> 15324.19s]  Oh, come on.
[15324.19s -> 15325.07s]  I hate these guys.
[15325.07s -> 15332.71s]  I hate these teleporting bullshit enemies.
[15332.71s -> 15333.55s]  Ugh.
[15351.46s -> 15352.30s]  Oh, fuck you.
[15358.99s -> 15366.57s]  What?
[15366.57s -> 15367.41s]  Oh.
[15374.83s -> 15384.54s]  If that's a C, then this game is hard.
[15384.54s -> 15385.38s]  I may have probably,
[15385.38s -> 15389.60s]  I could have done that a little faster on the second phase.
[15389.60s -> 15390.96s]  Skill usage.
[15390.96s -> 15399.49s]  Another C.
[15399.49s -> 15404.42s]  You gotta be perfect to do that shit.
[15404.42s -> 15405.26s]  Okay, somebody said,
[15405.26s -> 15407.70s]  do you recommend the second game?
[15407.70s -> 15411.73s]  I would say you should play at least the first two.
[15411.73s -> 15413.49s]  The only reason why I didn't play Travis Strikes again
[15413.49s -> 15416.25s]  is because I wasn't a fan of the top-down stuff.
[15416.25s -> 15417.65s]  I was gonna play it before this,
[15417.65s -> 15423.07s]  but I heard very, very mixed things about that game.
[15423.11s -> 15424.63s]  And not only that,
[15424.63s -> 15426.38s]  it's all top-down.
[15426.38s -> 15428.50s]  I think there's a couple of segments that aren't.
[15428.50s -> 15455.00s]  But, where's this fight?
[15455.00s -> 15461.04s]  Oh, there it is.
[15461.04s -> 15463.07s]  Transform!
[15463.07s -> 15470.78s]  Travis Strikes again is better than two.
[15470.78s -> 15473.76s]  Um, I really have to give it a chance.
[15473.76s -> 15476.36s]  But someone actually please correct me if I'm wrong here.
[15476.36s -> 15477.72s]  Change bucamelia!
[15477.72s -> 15483.69s]  Isn't Travis Strikes again a 40-hour game?
[15483.69s -> 15484.53s]  I feel like these games-
[15484.53s -> 15485.45s]  That's huge!
[15485.45s -> 15493.22s]  Whoa.
[15493.22s -> 15495.46s]  It's like 12.
[15495.46s -> 15497.98s]  I guess I'm, is it just wrong?
[15497.98s -> 15500.98s]  Fuck no, definitely not.
[15500.98s -> 15504.14s]  Like 15.
[15504.14s -> 15504.98s]  Okay, well this isn't new.
[15504.98s -> 15506.29s]  This is like a boss.
[15506.29s -> 15508.21s]  This giant suddenly appeared in Stratosphere
[15508.21s -> 15509.49s]  and has grown miraculously
[15509.49s -> 15514.01s]  in minus 270 degrees Celsius temperatures.
[15514.01s -> 15515.37s]  His ice cannons are powerful enough
[15515.37s -> 15518.55s]  to destroy entire planets.
[15518.55s -> 15519.39s]  Stay calm.
[15519.39s -> 15522.50s]  Your eye camera sensors will scan enemies for weak points.
[15522.50s -> 15523.58s]  That's gonna help.
[15523.58s -> 15525.22s]  These super big dudes always have a core
[15525.22s -> 15526.42s]  serving as their weak point.
[15526.42s -> 15531.14s]  All right, so let's get up here.
[15531.14s -> 15534.93s]  Phase one.
[15534.93s -> 15535.77s]  Wow!
[15545.00s -> 15549.28s]  Okay, so I hit him in the head.
[15549.28s -> 15550.12s]  Ice core.
[15555.38s -> 15556.22s]  Okay, we're good.
[15559.45s -> 15561.71s]  Mouth's open.
[15561.71s -> 15562.55s]  Yeah.
[15562.55s -> 15563.37s]  All right, when his mouth opens,
[15563.37s -> 15564.21s]  it's like a big clam.
[15564.21s -> 15568.49s]  Shoot it in the ear.
[15568.49s -> 15569.33s]  Oof.
[15575.09s -> 15575.93s]  I'm gonna open.
[15576.97s -> 15585.93s]  I just, I didn't get it.
[15585.93s -> 15586.77s]  His mouth is open now.
[15586.77s -> 15587.61s]  Shit.
[15587.61s -> 15595.15s]  Oh, I messed up, I messed up, I messed up.
[15595.15s -> 15602.37s]  Wait until he opens his mouth.
[15602.37s -> 15603.21s]  Here it goes.
[15603.21s -> 15605.37s]  Open up.
[15605.37s -> 15609.65s]  Open.
[15609.65s -> 15610.49s]  Open.
[15610.49s -> 15617.74s]  That's the shit on his ears.
[15626.24s -> 15627.08s]  All right.
[15627.08s -> 15627.90s]  I'm open.
[15627.90s -> 15628.74s]  I'm open.
[15628.74s -> 15629.58s]  Lockpad.
[15632.94s -> 15641.39s]  Just keep saying the same thing.
[15641.39s -> 15644.60s]  Say anything else, Travis.
[15644.60s -> 15649.50s]  Open your mouth.
[15649.50s -> 15650.34s]  I didn't even hit him.
[15650.34s -> 15656.84s]  What?
[15656.84s -> 15657.68s]  I can hit him.
[15657.68s -> 15662.46s]  Oh, I guess it's, okay, whatever.
[15662.46s -> 15668.01s]  Stop blocking.
[15668.01s -> 15671.56s]  What just happened?
[15671.56s -> 15675.42s]  What?
[15675.42s -> 15676.70s]  Was I just not even paying attention
[15676.70s -> 15679.94s]  to my health or something?
[15679.94s -> 15685.48s]  Are you serious?
[15685.48s -> 15686.32s]  What?
[15688.14s -> 15689.64s]  I don't understand.
[15689.64s -> 15691.94s]  I just wasn't looking at my health.
[15691.94s -> 15697.76s]  Change Bukabilia.
[15697.76s -> 15699.04s]  I had literally one HP.
[15699.04s -> 15700.12s]  Oh, that's annoying.
[15700.12s -> 15705.12s]  Why was I not looking at that?
[15705.12s -> 15710.47s]  I don't think I even had a heal.
[15710.47s -> 15711.31s]  Oh shit.
[15711.31s -> 15712.59s]  It is over there.
[15712.59s -> 15713.75s]  There's so much stuff on the screen.
[15713.75s -> 15727.80s]  It's almost like I couldn't even pay attention to it.
[15727.80s -> 15729.73s]  Does it hurt?
[15729.73s -> 15735.97s]  No, I'm not, fuck the cannon.
[15735.97s -> 15736.81s]  Yeah, like fuck the cannon.
[15736.81s -> 15737.63s]  I'm not even gonna use the cannon.
[15737.63s -> 15741.01s]  Cranberry.
[15741.01s -> 15744.08s]  These things are just better.
[15744.08s -> 15758.09s]  Poisonberry.
[15758.09s -> 15767.88s]  Go for that gas breath.
[15767.88s -> 15772.86s]  Over here.
[15772.86s -> 15775.66s]  Special kill.
[15775.66s -> 15777.02s]  Watch that health.
[15777.02s -> 15777.86s]  Lockhead.
[15778.86s -> 15781.72s]  Oh, that hit.
[15781.72s -> 15782.56s]  God damn it.
[15782.56s -> 15783.72s]  It's so hard to avoid that.
[15801.05s -> 15806.84s]  Get away.
[15806.84s -> 15810.90s]  Okay, now this is where he killed me instantly last time.
[15810.90s -> 15815.83s]  In the hands?
[15815.83s -> 15816.83s]  Let's get that core.
[15827.77s -> 15830.22s]  Come here.
[15830.22s -> 15831.06s]  Oh shit.
[15835.26s -> 15836.22s]  Where are those things?
[15836.22s -> 15837.54s]  I don't wanna hit them.
[15841.54s -> 15843.50s]  Phase two and he's dead.
[15843.50s -> 15845.50s]  That's a very bad score because I died.
[15861.46s -> 15875.37s]  I swear he didn't say that this much when I played.
[15875.37s -> 15876.97s]  Yeah, I know what it is.
[15876.97s -> 15881.72s]  Really?
[15881.72s -> 15890.06s]  Interesting.
[15890.06s -> 15892.37s]  Because I died?
[15892.37s -> 15894.05s]  Yeah, how many of these would I not get to see on
[15894.05s -> 15896.09s]  if I knew what it was, didn't take a bunch of damage,
[15896.09s -> 15902.12s]  and could retry it and do it again?
[15902.12s -> 15904.16s]  There's two more?
[15904.16s -> 15914.78s]  There's actually like three more.
[15914.78s -> 15916.38s]  Oh, this is the toilet.
[15916.42s -> 15917.82s]  Let's do the toilet.
[15917.82s -> 15923.00s]  And this one over here.
[15923.00s -> 15926.26s]  This is also a, is it red?
[15926.26s -> 15928.87s]  This one's just regular.
[15928.87s -> 15934.88s]  Do the toilet first.
[15934.88s -> 15936.24s]  This is what Vegas looks like?
[15936.24s -> 15938.41s]  Kind of.
[15938.41s -> 15944.24s]  A lot of it.
[15944.24s -> 15945.08s]  What is that?
[15948.59s -> 15967.69s]  Why does it have a big star on it?
[15967.69s -> 15969.05s]  Is that what it looks like when you step over it?
[15969.05s -> 15971.41s]  No.
[15971.41s -> 15972.25s]  I don't think I've ever seen what they look like
[15972.25s -> 15973.09s]  on the minimap.
[15983.11s -> 15999.69s]  Hey, oh, my hands are shaking now.
[15999.69s -> 16015.26s]  Do it already.
[16015.30s -> 16016.14s]  My friend is watching.
[16016.14s -> 16017.34s]  Please say something funny.
[16024.98s -> 16041.34s]  No, I don't really feel like it.
[16041.34s -> 16042.50s]  Yeah, we've reached the part of the stream
[16042.50s -> 16046.81s]  where I'm just like, my back's against the chair.
[16046.81s -> 16048.65s]  Got my Joy-Cons here, I'm just leaning back,
[16048.65s -> 16050.49s]  and I'm just enjoying this video game
[16050.49s -> 16052.68s]  because it's a good one.
[16052.68s -> 16054.80s]  We've reached enjoy the game portion of the stream
[16054.80s -> 16057.04s]  where I'm just, my back is just here.
[16057.04s -> 16061.52s]  Leaning back.
[16061.52s -> 16064.13s]  Evolver burger.
[16064.13s -> 16068.72s]  I think I've done it 25 times.
[16068.72s -> 16075.46s]  I want to keep the other shirt.
[16075.46s -> 16076.30s]  How is my back doing?
[16076.30s -> 16082.42s]  I'm doing, I'm good.
[16082.42s -> 16085.73s]  What else is here?
[16085.73s -> 16087.65s]  The toilet, the bike, and the shirt.
[16093.48s -> 16097.00s]  I was actually not horrible after the dollhouse stuff,
[16097.00s -> 16098.48s]  which is surprising considering
[16098.48s -> 16107.21s]  I kind of beat the shit out of myself.
[16107.21s -> 16112.82s]  But yes, the reduced time sitting down
[16112.82s -> 16114.22s]  has absolutely helped.
[16114.22s -> 16115.50s]  I will be completely honest with you
[16115.50s -> 16116.90s]  and I'm proud of you.
[16116.90s -> 16118.78s]  Going back to once or twice a week
[16118.78s -> 16120.10s]  and not sitting down,
[16120.10s -> 16123.94s]  because, I mean, a couple years ago,
[16123.94s -> 16126.56s]  two years ago or so,
[16126.56s -> 16130.52s]  probably really was not doing myself any favors
[16130.56s -> 16136.38s]  by sitting down here for seven to 10 hours a night.
[16136.38s -> 16139.10s]  Because there was this part of the stream life
[16139.10s -> 16141.54s]  that I've had where when I first started streaming,
[16141.54s -> 16143.79s]  I streamed for two hours,
[16143.79s -> 16146.39s]  like two or three times a week.
[16146.39s -> 16148.51s]  And then when I made the full transition to Twitch
[16148.51s -> 16151.10s]  and stopped completely doing YouTube at all,
[16151.10s -> 16156.02s]  that I started doing seven, eight, nine hour streams.
[16156.02s -> 16158.59s]  Three, four, five times a week sometimes.
[16158.59s -> 16160.67s]  At least three or four times a week.
[16160.67s -> 16164.46s]  And that probably was not a good thing to do.
[16164.50s -> 16172.32s]  This looks hard, hold on.
[16172.32s -> 16175.12s]  So my body was already having these issues
[16175.12s -> 16179.05s]  and I was sort of making them worse, I think.
[16179.05s -> 16183.39s]  But ever since being able to kind of sit here
[16183.39s -> 16186.98s]  and stream for once or twice a week,
[16186.98s -> 16189.94s]  five to seven hours, four to six hours, something like that,
[16189.94s -> 16200.48s]  I don't have like a time limit really.
[16200.48s -> 16205.54s]  Hey, this jumping guy is so annoying.
[16205.54s -> 16207.14s]  Oh, this place sucks.
[16207.14s -> 16209.10s]  I don't think I have any food left.
[16221.18s -> 16222.02s]  There he is.
[16222.02s -> 16225.96s]  All right, take care of him.
[16225.96s -> 16227.20s]  Ooh, Mustang mode.
[16227.20s -> 16230.62s]  Mustang, Mustang, Mustang mode.
[16230.62s -> 16248.12s]  That's what Mustang mode is, okay, good.
[16248.12s -> 16250.32s]  You say you're gonna get a standing desk?
[16250.32s -> 16253.04s]  Yeah, and so here's the thing though.
[16253.04s -> 16255.55s]  It's stationary.
[16255.55s -> 16258.58s]  The more that I am stationary, the worse it is.
[16258.58s -> 16263.05s]  So even with a standing desk, standing in the same spot
[16263.05s -> 16278.65s]  is essentially the same thing.
[16278.65s -> 16284.01s]  Make a treadmill, get a treadmill desk?
[16284.01s -> 16285.49s]  No, that's not gonna happen.
[16285.49s -> 16288.48s]  I'll be winded in 10 minutes.
[16288.48s -> 16290.48s]  All right, now I have enough, I can do the ATM
[16290.48s -> 16296.82s]  and start the next fight.
[16296.82s -> 16300.34s]  I think you'll bill one halo
[16300.34s -> 16307.31s]  for the five community subs, appreciate it.
[16307.31s -> 16309.51s]  But it's not been bad lately.
[16313.19s -> 16315.55s]  There was a few times on stream where you probably saw
[16315.55s -> 16318.61s]  like when the face cam was on or not.
[16318.61s -> 16320.81s]  You can always tell when I'm really uncomfortable,
[16320.81s -> 16324.50s]  when my shoulders go back and I push my chest up
[16324.50s -> 16326.50s]  more than once or twice every few minutes.
[16335.55s -> 16338.12s]  He is but a simple human.
[16338.12s -> 16340.56s]  I'm going to cut off his arms
[16340.56s -> 16344.46s]  and we'll then proceed to slice him up nicely.
[16344.46s -> 16347.18s]  Hey, tell me about some of your memories.
[16347.18s -> 16350.74s]  Feeling sentimental, hmm?
[16350.74s -> 16354.74s]  I don't like it when a friend dies.
[16354.74s -> 16357.57s]  This happened a long time ago.
[16357.57s -> 16360.52s]  I went on a family trip to the sea
[16360.52s -> 16363.83s]  but I don't remember anything about the ocean.
[16363.83s -> 16367.67s]  What was burned into my memory was a shop
[16367.67s -> 16370.67s]  with a glass bulb hanging from the ceiling.
[16370.71s -> 16374.58s]  I was moved by the sound of the jingling glass.
[16374.58s -> 16380.00s]  And when I left the shop, there was a white lighthouse.
[16380.00s -> 16386.18s]  But as for where that place was, I have no idea at all.
[16386.18s -> 16388.57s]  That's a nice story.
[16388.57s -> 16392.66s]  Let's go out there and find that lighthouse together.
[16392.66s -> 16394.82s]  Lord Fool.
[16394.82s -> 16396.38s]  Thank you.
[16396.38s -> 16400.68s]  Now go, Black Knight direction.
[16400.68s -> 16411.87s]  I'm off.
[16411.87s -> 16420.30s]  It's a really weird way to end that cut scene, I think.
[16420.30s -> 16422.11s]  You know what time it is.
[16422.11s -> 16424.05s]  It's been at least two hours or so.
[16424.05s -> 16424.89s]  I get to do this.
[16424.93s -> 16427.01s]  And by the way, speaking of doing this,
[16427.01s -> 16430.12s]  what am I eating today?
[16430.12s -> 16433.35s]  Come on, what's the matter?
[16433.35s -> 16436.05s]  What do you think?
[16436.05s -> 16436.89s]  Burger?
[16436.89s -> 16437.89s]  Nah, I'm not feeling a burger.
[16437.89s -> 16438.73s]  Pizza?
[16438.73s -> 16439.57s]  Yup.
[16439.57s -> 16442.47s]  It's been a while since I've had pizza.
[16443.59s -> 16445.91s]  I haven't had pizza in a very long time.
[16445.91s -> 16448.39s]  Been at least a month or two, maybe.
[16456.18s -> 16457.02s]  Thai food?
[16457.02s -> 16457.86s]  Ooh.
[16459.26s -> 16460.54s]  That's another great option.
[16460.54s -> 16461.54s]  That sounds great.
[16461.54s -> 16462.38s]  Shepard's pie?
[16463.62s -> 16465.46s]  I mean, I really want that, because you just said it,
[16465.46s -> 16469.11s]  but that means I have to make Shepard's pie.
[16469.11s -> 16470.91s]  I have to make mashed potatoes.
[16470.91s -> 16472.12s]  Yeah.
[16472.12s -> 16474.44s]  I have to put some ground beef and some onions
[16474.44s -> 16475.76s]  into a pan, simmer that.
[16475.76s -> 16477.56s]  That's probably going to take some time.
[16477.56s -> 16478.40s]  Meow.
[16478.40s -> 16479.68s]  I'm going to get that right.
[16480.56s -> 16483.51s]  I don't have mashed potatoes.
[16485.51s -> 16487.43s]  I don't have any ground beef either, so.
[16487.43s -> 16488.27s]  Bring it.
[16488.27s -> 16490.11s]  Ground lamb?
[16490.11s -> 16491.95s]  That doesn't make any sense to me.
[16492.91s -> 16495.83s]  That just made me angry to look over and see that.
[16495.83s -> 16496.67s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[16497.91s -> 16499.07s]  That just threw me off.
[16500.87s -> 16502.47s]  Look at how bad that threw me off.
[16506.87s -> 16510.93s]  I think lamb, I don't like lamb.
[16510.93s -> 16512.50s]  I don't eat lamb.
[16512.50s -> 16513.42s]  I'm not into lamb.
[16520.22s -> 16521.46s]  What's wrong with lamb?
[16521.46s -> 16522.61s]  I don't like it.
[16524.69s -> 16528.28s]  Shepard's pie is lamb.
[16528.28s -> 16534.44s]  I've always had Shepard's pie with ground beef.
[16536.11s -> 16537.95s]  Maybe my mother made it that way
[16537.95s -> 16540.23s]  because she knew that I didn't like lamb.
[16542.30s -> 16544.26s]  That's why it's called Shepard's pie.
[16547.30s -> 16548.94s]  I always thought it was like Shepard's pie
[16548.94s -> 16553.31s]  because that's like what the Shepard ate.
[16553.31s -> 16554.15s]  But if that makes sense.
[16554.15s -> 16563.13s]  But the Shepard eats his sheep?
[16563.13s -> 16563.97s]  Yes.
[16566.65s -> 16568.29s]  Oh, they're not reindeers.
[16568.29s -> 16569.13s]  What am I talking about?
[16569.13s -> 16569.97s]  Like it doesn't fly around
[16569.97s -> 16571.53s]  and deliver presents to people with sheep.
[16571.53s -> 16573.41s]  Of course, that's what they do.
[16573.41s -> 16574.61s]  What am I talking about?
[16577.14s -> 16578.50s]  Cottage pie is the beef one.
[16578.50s -> 16579.34s]  Oh, okay.
[16582.34s -> 16583.18s]  This is fucking hard.
[16583.18s -> 16586.54s]  I have to get at least 10 to 20.
[16586.54s -> 16589.14s]  They don't raise the sheep for fun.
[16589.14s -> 16590.74s]  Hold on.
[16590.74s -> 16591.90s]  It threw me off again.
[16596.30s -> 16599.06s]  Well, yeah, I thought it was wool too.
[16599.06s -> 16600.42s]  I thought it was like wool.
[16605.90s -> 16611.78s]  Sheep are raised for wool and milk, you dummies.
[16611.78s -> 16615.88s]  I didn't think that they raise the sheep to shear the wool.
[16615.88s -> 16620.10s]  Yeah, they don't like raise the sheep to make Shepard's pie.
[16620.10s -> 16621.54s]  That's not why they do that.
[16623.19s -> 16624.03s]  Hold on.
[16624.03s -> 16625.43s]  Am I getting fucked with here?
[16637.25s -> 16639.17s]  Shepard's pie is any red meat.
[16639.17s -> 16640.09s]  That's what I thought too.
[16640.09s -> 16643.78s]  I think people are just being weirdos.
[16643.78s -> 16645.26s]  Well, I got 15.
[16645.26s -> 16646.30s]  Wow, that actually counted.
[16646.30s -> 16647.14s]  Okay, cool.
[16658.08s -> 16658.92s]  Oh, yeah.
[16658.92s -> 16660.08s]  Okay, well, that's crazy.
[16661.16s -> 16662.00s]  I'll take 17.
[16670.30s -> 16676.58s]  That's not a bad score.
[16676.58s -> 16681.18s]  Hey, David.
[16681.18s -> 16682.86s]  And probably after I beat this guy,
[16682.86s -> 16683.98s]  or after I fight this guy,
[16683.98s -> 16686.46s]  we'll probably call it here and we'll keep going tomorrow.
[16686.46s -> 16689.62s]  Because I'm just thinking about Shepard's pie and pizza.
[16689.62s -> 16694.02s]  I combined the two and Shepard's pie just turned into
[16694.02s -> 16697.78s]  a hamburger and onion pizza with a side of mashed potatoes.
[16699.18s -> 16701.58s]  And I'm gonna try to get that to be a reality.
[16710.30s -> 16711.14s]  Yeah, let's go.
[16719.91s -> 16721.07s]  Did you end the stream by accident?
[16721.07s -> 16727.46s]  No.
[16727.46s -> 16729.58s]  You want some starch with your starch.
[16736.06s -> 16737.22s]  So who is this?
[16737.22s -> 16740.01s]  I have to go to the Thunderdome, okay.
[16740.01s -> 16744.90s]  I need a sushi place.
[16744.90s -> 16746.14s]  That guy's driving backwards.
[16746.14s -> 16747.50s]  See that truck?
[16747.50s -> 16760.28s]  What the hell was that?
[16760.28s -> 16763.85s]  Try to find me.
[16763.85s -> 16765.45s]  Hey there, Mr. Assassin, let's play a game.
[16765.45s -> 16766.98s]  Try to find me.
[16766.98s -> 16767.80s]  What am I?
[16767.80s -> 16769.18s]  Find me and you'll know.
[16769.18s -> 16770.58s]  Or maybe you won't.
[16771.42s -> 16773.22s]  Because I am the imitator of everything.
[16773.22s -> 16780.89s]  I will wait for you forever in the glorious land.
[16780.89s -> 16783.98s]  Yes.
[16783.98s -> 16786.40s]  Okay, recommendations.
[16786.40s -> 16788.52s]  We got a new movie recommended for you.
[16788.52s -> 16789.84s]  51 Grams.
[16789.84s -> 16792.49s]  What's with the 51?
[16792.49s -> 16798.68s]  51st Chamber.
[16798.68s -> 16800.72s]  Oh, I have upgrade points.
[16800.72s -> 16803.14s]  Forgot about that.
[16803.14s -> 16804.30s]  Look at how, all right.
[16804.30s -> 16805.14s]  I love this game.
[16805.14s -> 16806.86s]  I love this series.
[16806.86s -> 16810.10s]  Holy shit, that building looks awful.
[16810.10s -> 16811.14s]  Truly awful.
[16811.14s -> 16811.98s]  I'm sorry, I'm just gonna,
[16811.98s -> 16813.34s]  I'm gonna call it exactly how I see it.
[16813.34s -> 16824.62s]  It looks awful.
[16824.62s -> 16826.66s]  There's more artifacts on that building
[16826.66s -> 16843.23s]  than there were in King Tut's tomb.
[16843.23s -> 16844.07s]  Good one.
[16844.07s -> 16852.04s]  Hey, thanks, man.
[16852.04s -> 16855.56s]  That's the only complaint of the entire game so far.
[16855.56s -> 16861.22s]  The only one.
[16861.22s -> 16864.63s]  And look, I don't even look at the buildings.
[16864.63s -> 16866.11s]  What am I looking at the buildings for?
[16866.11s -> 16873.35s]  I'm not even looking at them.
[16873.35s -> 16887.05s]  So the weight of that problem is very, very small.
[16887.05s -> 16888.71s]  Oh, all right.
[16888.71s -> 16890.37s]  What I wanna do here,
[16890.37s -> 16891.61s]  I should probably get some, a skill.
[16891.61s -> 16896.27s]  3,000.
[16896.27s -> 16898.12s]  I'll take the health upgrade.
[16898.12s -> 16899.90s]  Nice.
[16900.74s -> 16902.59s]  2,200.
[16909.22s -> 16911.70s]  I'm gonna have to do it at some point.
[16911.70s -> 16914.02s]  And now that's a running slash.
[16914.02s -> 16916.86s]  And then charge attack.
[16916.86s -> 16919.90s]  That's also really good.
[16919.90s -> 16922.05s]  Battery.
[16922.05s -> 16922.89s]  3,200.
[16922.89s -> 16924.65s]  Attack or, yeah, I'll do another attack.
[16928.98s -> 16931.83s]  I think I have enough for, no, I don't.
[16931.83s -> 16933.93s]  I need, no.
[16933.93s -> 16939.52s]  I can do another health.
[16939.52s -> 16940.73s]  Yeah.
[16940.73s -> 16941.57s]  I have 1,900.
[16941.57s -> 16942.65s]  I don't think I can buy anything else.
[16942.65s -> 16943.49s]  Can I?
[16943.49s -> 16944.33s]  22.
[16944.33s -> 16951.34s]  Oh, I can, right?
[16951.34s -> 16952.82s]  22, no.
[16952.82s -> 16956.11s]  Yeah, wait, I can.
[16956.11s -> 16957.79s]  Nice.
[16957.79s -> 16958.61s]  All right.
[16958.61s -> 16959.45s]  No more health for a little while.
[16959.45s -> 16960.75s]  I wanna do more damage.
[16960.75s -> 16964.99s]  Like I'm swinging too hard at stuff.
[16964.99s -> 16966.79s]  Long dash.
[16966.79s -> 16969.95s]  Oh, it's a double.
[16969.95s -> 16972.57s]  Mash Y to unleash a high,
[16972.57s -> 16975.77s]  that's really cool too.
[16975.77s -> 16979.60s]  Mustang dodge.
[16979.60s -> 16981.12s]  Ooh.
[16981.12s -> 16982.84s]  If you have full health and you do a perfect dodge,
[16982.84s -> 16984.12s]  you can just annihilate.
[16984.12s -> 16984.96s]  All right.
[16984.96s -> 16985.88s]  That's cool.
[16985.88s -> 16990.78s]  That's a $30,000.
[16990.78s -> 16993.97s]  All right.
[16993.97s -> 17003.46s]  Let's also check, look at this.
[17003.46s -> 17004.90s]  What can I make?
[17004.90s -> 17009.14s]  Can I make a third one of these?
[17009.14s -> 17011.57s]  Uh, no, I can't.
[17011.57s -> 17014.46s]  Can I make another one of those?
[17014.46s -> 17017.14s]  Heavy attack power down, normal attack up.
[17017.14s -> 17020.88s]  Currently doing a lot of heavy attacks.
[17020.88s -> 17022.62s]  Cannot create.
[17022.62s -> 17026.45s]  Death force attack power 10% up.
[17026.45s -> 17031.62s]  A lot of materials.
[17031.62s -> 17033.54s]  When health is at 20% or below,
[17033.54s -> 17035.86s]  weapon attack power is plus 15%.
[17043.78s -> 17049.29s]  I feel like I'd be too scared to be that low.
[17049.29s -> 17051.85s]  You're at 88% or above, 8% up.
[17051.85s -> 17056.08s]  I kind of like that.
[17056.08s -> 17059.18s]  I kind of want like a three of those.
[17059.18s -> 17060.62s]  During slow down after a perfect dodge,
[17060.62s -> 17062.18s]  attack power is plus 10%.
[17062.18s -> 17067.36s]  That's cool.
[17067.36s -> 17070.12s]  Weapon attack power down, but damage taken down.
[17076.34s -> 17080.24s]  Successful guard power consumed 20% down.
[17080.24s -> 17089.20s]  How long though?
[17089.20s -> 17090.28s]  Health is at 80%.
[17090.28s -> 17091.12s]  All right.
[17091.12s -> 17094.98s]  Let's make, make this one.
[17094.98s -> 17098.03s]  No, where is it?
[17098.03s -> 17099.51s]  So when I'm at 80% or higher,
[17099.51s -> 17102.77s]  my weapon attack is 8% up.
[17102.77s -> 17103.65s]  Cause I'll replace one of the ones
[17103.65s -> 17104.49s]  that makes me take more damage.
[17104.49s -> 17109.71s]  Yeah, I want this one.
[17109.71s -> 17111.19s]  Cause I usually try to stay above 80%.
[17111.19s -> 17112.35s]  I'm a maniac.
[17112.35s -> 17115.80s]  I freak out if I'm not.
[17116.68s -> 17117.52s]  What does the tension gauge do?
[17117.52s -> 17124.36s]  I actually don't know.
[17124.36s -> 17125.32s]  Okay.
[17125.32s -> 17127.56s]  Damage taken 5% up, weapon attack power.
[17127.56s -> 17131.18s]  I think I, maybe I'll get rid of this one.
[17131.18s -> 17137.24s]  Getting me into too much trouble.
[17137.24s -> 17142.03s]  So now I just do 10% more damage,
[17142.03s -> 17143.59s]  which includes heavy,
[17143.59s -> 17145.87s]  but also the regular attack power too.
[17145.87s -> 17156.16s]  Yeah, I like that.
[17156.16s -> 17158.94s]  Refill on sushi.
[17158.94s -> 17160.22s]  Oh, it's the tiger thing in the corner.
[17160.22s -> 17161.06s]  All right.
[17164.31s -> 17166.47s]  Eat something, can't eat in.
[17170.12s -> 17170.96s]  All right.
[17170.96s -> 17171.80s]  I need five of these.
[17173.22s -> 17176.00s]  Essentially makes me run out of money.
[17176.00s -> 17180.72s]  I haven't used any of these.
[17180.72s -> 17181.76s]  All right.
[17181.76s -> 17184.25s]  I have to pee, but I'm going to hold it.
[17184.25s -> 17185.09s]  No I'm not.
[17185.09s -> 17186.10s]  I'll be right back.
[17186.10s -> 17187.22s]  All right, this is the final break of the evening.
[17187.22s -> 17188.10s]  I will take a piss.
[17188.10s -> 17189.02s]  I'll be right back.
[17189.02s -> 17190.92s]  We're going to try to beat this boss
[17190.92s -> 17191.76s]  and we'll probably call it there
[17191.76s -> 17192.88s]  and I'll see you tomorrow.
[17192.88s -> 17194.16s]  So I'll be right back.
[17194.16s -> 17363.60s]  We'll try to fight the boss.
[17363.60s -> 17364.44s]  Damn.
[17367.61s -> 17370.29s]  You know, it's time to like change the pants you have
[17370.29s -> 17371.13s]  or the underwear.
[17371.13s -> 17373.31s]  Like what the hell?
[17373.31s -> 17377.66s]  So the band of my underwear
[17377.82s -> 17381.01s]  has apparently been, this whole time,
[17381.01s -> 17382.81s]  so tight around my waist
[17382.81s -> 17385.96s]  and I haven't even really noticed
[17385.96s -> 17390.79s]  that I have those just two indent lines
[17390.79s -> 17396.04s]  where the elastic is around my entire body
[17396.04s -> 17398.48s]  and it hurts.
[17398.48s -> 17400.34s]  This actually hurts.
[17400.34s -> 17402.67s]  Ow.
[17402.67s -> 17403.51s]  What the hell?
[17403.51s -> 17410.73s]  How fat am I getting?
[17410.73s -> 17411.81s]  Dude, it's time for new underwear.
[17411.81s -> 17413.21s]  This is nice underwear.
[17413.21s -> 17417.01s]  This is, I just don't fit into it anymore.
[17417.01s -> 17422.92s]  Oh well, whatever.
[17422.92s -> 17428.65s]  Let's come back.
[17428.65s -> 17431.72s]  I'm trying to plan a workout stream.
[17431.72s -> 17434.86s]  Yeah, I need to, I need to figure that out.
[17434.86s -> 17435.70s]  All right, whatever.
[17435.70s -> 17438.57s]  Let's go.
[17438.57s -> 17448.76s]  Try to fight this next boss.
[17448.76s -> 17452.06s]  Save the game.
[17452.06s -> 17465.52s]  All right, I wonder what this boss is going to be like.
[17465.52s -> 17466.36s]  What's going on?
[17466.36s -> 17469.35s]  I just got some cheese sticks.
[17469.35s -> 17471.93s]  I just actually got fish sticks recently.
[17471.93s -> 17482.51s]  Those things are so good.
[17482.51s -> 17485.96s]  You?
[17485.96s -> 17487.46s]  You, really?
[17487.46s -> 17489.14s]  I love, those are amazing.
[17489.14s -> 17492.28s]  I love fish sticks.
[17492.28s -> 17497.43s]  Yes, I've seen the South Park episode.
[17497.43s -> 17511.49s]  I think we all have.
[17511.49s -> 17512.33s]  All right, so we're going to get on the highway
[17512.33s -> 17518.59s]  and we're going to go back to the Thunderdome.
[17518.59s -> 17520.51s]  You eat like a toddler.
[17520.51s -> 17522.96s]  I've, no, I don't.
[17522.96s -> 17525.95s]  But let's be fair though.
[17525.95s -> 17531.50s]  The kids menu at every major restaurant
[17531.50s -> 17533.26s]  always seems to have some real good shit on it
[17533.26s -> 17536.13s]  that you know you would enjoy, doesn't it?
[17536.13s -> 17544.64s]  I don't order off the kids menu, but I'm just being honest.
[17544.64s -> 17548.20s]  You can't look at the kids menu and go, ugh.
[17548.20s -> 17550.64s]  Chicken nuggets, ugh, gross.
[17550.64s -> 17552.00s]  Mac and cheese, disgusting.
[17552.00s -> 17553.28s]  I, ugh, ugh.
[17554.20s -> 17558.04s]  French fries, onion rings, ugh.
[17558.04s -> 17560.00s]  Apple slices, ugh.
[17560.00s -> 17565.00s]  Please, you probably, if you order from McDonald's,
[17565.76s -> 17568.06s]  anything off the whole menu,
[17568.06s -> 17571.57s]  then don't give me shit for looking at the kids menu.
[17571.57s -> 17582.00s]  Him, would be fair about that.
[17582.00s -> 17583.50s]  Grow up.
[17583.50s -> 17588.50s]  I, look, I eat boring stuff too, like salads.
[17588.50s -> 17596.14s]  Caesar salad, ooh, a chopped salad.
[17596.14s -> 17599.62s]  I eat, oh, like a baked fish.
[17599.62s -> 17603.20s]  That was delicious.
[17603.20s -> 17604.04s]  That is fun.
[17610.53s -> 17611.69s]  Tuna is one of my favorite things.
[17611.69s -> 17622.91s]  Yeah, I love to salmon, I love tuna.
[17622.91s -> 17628.77s]  Caesar salad, oh, mega lull, why?
[17628.77s -> 17631.89s]  And by the way, what fancy ass restaurants and food,
[17631.89s -> 17636.58s]  what are you eating every day?
[17636.58s -> 17652.13s]  Do you guys have like a personal chef?
[17652.13s -> 17657.40s]  That sucked, the fight here.
[17657.40s -> 17665.66s]  Let's just do the boss.
[17665.66s -> 17673.07s]  I'm an adult, I know how to cook.
[17673.07s -> 17674.98s]  Really?
[17674.98s -> 17678.62s]  The number eight ranked assassin is Black Knight Direction.
[17678.62s -> 17680.96s]  He is a space kidnapper.
[17680.96s -> 17683.96s]  He uses an illegal unlicensed transfer machine
[17683.96s -> 17687.16s]  to kidnap important and valuable people in space
[17687.16s -> 17689.12s]  and sell them to the powerful.
[17689.12s -> 17691.24s]  But dressing, I like a lemon, lemon vinaigrette.
[17691.24s -> 17693.69s]  Absolutely wild, Travis.
[17693.69s -> 17695.85s]  To the garden of insanity.
[17695.85s -> 17698.96s]  I just like olive oil.
[17698.96s -> 17702.79s]  Olive oil is pretty good for just a salad dressing.
[17702.79s -> 17704.87s]  I actually like olive oil and pasta.
[17704.87s -> 17709.13s]  So, I'm less a fan of red and white sauce on pasta
[17709.13s -> 17713.17s]  and more just olive oil and salt.
[17713.17s -> 17714.85s]  It's like, oh, pasta, that sounds good.
[17714.85s -> 17716.45s]  That's how I like it, preferred.
[17723.31s -> 17727.89s]  That's drive, mini girl.
[17727.89s -> 17729.29s]  Have I done enough wrestling moves?
[17729.29s -> 17732.22s]  No.
[17732.22s -> 17735.34s]  Olive oil by itself, yeah.
[17735.34s -> 17737.34s]  Olive oil, salt, and Parmesan on pasta is perfect.
[17737.34s -> 17738.99s]  It is.
[17738.99s -> 17745.33s]  I just like to get a really, really good EVOO.
[17745.33s -> 17753.81s]  A lot of stuff to do in this game, it's insane.
[17753.81s -> 17762.76s]  Where's this toilet?
[17762.76s -> 17763.68s]  I like omelets.
[17763.68s -> 17769.14s]  I love eggs too, yeah.
[17769.14s -> 17775.67s]  Omelets, like a fried rice with egg, awesome.
[17775.67s -> 17776.95s]  I love sauteed vegetables
[17776.95s -> 17779.11s]  and like just grilled chicken in a way.
[17779.27s -> 17785.03s]  I'm a big fan of a lot of different foods.
[17785.03s -> 17787.67s]  You like all cheeses, not all cheeses.
[17787.67s -> 17789.75s]  I actually don't really love soft cheeses.
[17789.75s -> 17791.07s]  I'm not a big brie person.
[17791.95s -> 17799.18s]  I like hard cheeses, not soft.
[17799.18s -> 17800.02s]  Cringe.
[17806.30s -> 17809.72s]  I love horseradish, one of my favorite things.
[17811.37s -> 17813.25s]  The wasabi that you get at restaurants,
[17813.25s -> 17814.37s]  that's not real wasabi,
[17814.37s -> 17817.56s]  it's just horseradish that's dyed green.
[17817.56s -> 17818.48s]  I love that stuff.
[17818.48s -> 17819.84s]  I wish I could, I put it on everything.
[17819.84s -> 17822.32s]  I could put that on literally every single food
[17822.32s -> 17831.20s]  that I've ever eaten and love it.
[17831.20s -> 17832.04s]  What about sauerkraut?
[17832.04s -> 17849.97s]  No, I'm actually not a big sauerkraut fan.
[17849.97s -> 17852.75s]  Put it on your Captain Crunch.
[17852.75s -> 17856.21s]  I actually, that's falling out of favor.
[17856.21s -> 17860.18s]  The Dunkin' Donuts mocha latte cereal
[17860.18s -> 17863.06s]  has taken over completely at this point.
[17863.06s -> 17870.26s]  Almost 100%.
[17870.26s -> 17882.29s]  All right, let's do it.
[17882.29s -> 17883.81s]  How is this place?
[17883.81s -> 17886.13s]  Looks like something out of Black Raid.
[17886.13s -> 17888.05s]  So is this Osaka?
[17888.05s -> 17889.57s]  Yes, gotta be.
[17889.57s -> 17891.77s]  Everyone's wearing tigers on their clothes.
[17896.18s -> 17897.14s]  He's here. Hello.
[17897.70s -> 17899.26s]  He's gonna fight in the street?
[17899.26s -> 17903.66s]  Probably.
[17903.66s -> 17905.86s]  Sense anything.
[17905.86s -> 17907.54s]  Some kind of zen thing, maybe?
[17911.18s -> 17912.02s]  The fuck?
[17916.24s -> 17917.40s]  Culture, huh?
[17917.40s -> 17918.92s]  Didn't your mama teach you
[17918.92s -> 17921.00s]  that it is not okay to steal shit?
[17921.00s -> 17922.48s]  They do this every game.
[17923.78s -> 17927.56s]  This isn't your scene.
[17927.56s -> 17929.96s]  I got no idea who the hell you are.
[17929.96s -> 17931.76s]  But stay the fuck out of this.
[17931.76s -> 17935.08s]  This town's problems are my problems.
[17935.08s -> 17936.84s]  You're just like they say.
[17937.68s -> 17938.88s]  I've also heard that you can't solve a thing
[17938.88s -> 17940.28s]  without brute force.
[17940.28s -> 17941.80s]  Look, outsider.
[17941.80s -> 17944.20s]  Who the fuck are you anyway?
[17944.20s -> 17945.80s]  I'm from the future.
[17945.80s -> 17947.28s]  It's a long story, but...
[17947.28s -> 17948.52s]  Don't bother.
[17948.52s -> 17952.08s]  Once we do battle, I'll know all I need to know.
[17952.08s -> 17953.76s]  When am I gonna get my next katana upgrade?
[17953.76s -> 17955.64s]  I won't hold back.
[17955.64s -> 17956.48s]  Hell yeah.
[17956.48s -> 17957.32s]  I wonder how many katanas are in the game.
[17957.32s -> 17958.56s]  That's what I wanna hear.
[17958.56s -> 17959.72s]  Bring it!
[17959.72s -> 17961.68s]  Activate Night Reaper mode.
[17961.68s -> 17965.16s]  Strawberry on the sweet shortcake.
[17966.12s -> 17966.96s]  What?
[17971.70s -> 17973.95s]  Oh my God, I'm in Mustang mode.
[17973.95s -> 17974.79s]  I'm in, where is he?
[17974.79s -> 17976.51s]  I'm in Mustang mode, please.
[17976.51s -> 17979.66s]  Oh, that's sad.
[17979.66s -> 17991.09s]  It's all the way down here.
[17991.09s -> 17993.49s]  Your killer instinct is simply unmatched.
[17993.49s -> 17996.21s]  I can feel it all the way down in my bones.
[17996.21s -> 17997.89s]  I want to express my respect
[17997.89s -> 18001.29s]  for that fighting spirit and bloodlust, grandpa.
[18001.29s -> 18003.29s]  This is Death Slow.
[18003.29s -> 18011.46s]  It's quite an elegant ability, perfect for you.
[18011.46s -> 18013.96s]  Death Slow.
[18013.96s -> 18015.52s]  If you're quite a new skill,
[18015.52s -> 18019.85s]  use its strange power to slow down time in your vicinity.
[18019.85s -> 18021.81s]  Unleash it by holding L and pressing A.
[18021.81s -> 18023.41s]  So L and A.
[18023.41s -> 18024.65s]  That has a cooldown.
[18024.65s -> 18025.49s]  Okay.
[18030.63s -> 18031.47s]  This guy should provide it now.
[18031.47s -> 18036.28s]  I think I have four viewers watching.
[18036.28s -> 18037.12s]  Wait, hold on.
[18037.12s -> 18039.34s]  Hold on, they're coming.
[18039.34s -> 18044.54s]  10, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[18044.54s -> 18047.16s]  Holy shit, here it goes.
[18047.16s -> 18050.82s]  20, 21, 26.
[18050.82s -> 18057.10s]  Well, I mean, we kinda have to wait for people, right?
[18057.14s -> 18058.62s]  I wonder how quickly, something like this.
[18058.62s -> 18059.82s]  Oh, there's two people,
[18059.82s -> 18061.34s]  like there's two assassins fighting each other
[18061.34s -> 18063.70s]  in the street on Twitch right now.
[18063.70s -> 18064.74s]  They have like magic powers.
[18064.74s -> 18068.89s]  Like how fast would this go up, do you think?
[18068.89s -> 18070.69s]  Okay, let's do Death Slow.
[18087.64s -> 18098.02s]  Okay, so I slow time down and, where'd he go?
[18098.02s -> 18104.77s]  50 viewer Andy.
[18104.77s -> 18106.33s]  This is less of a boss fight and more of a,
[18106.33s -> 18107.45s]  I'm teaching you moves.
[18107.45s -> 18110.88s]  I'm probably gonna fight him after.
[18110.88s -> 18112.24s]  This would sit at one viewer.
[18112.24s -> 18122.30s]  No, it would not.
[18122.30s -> 18124.22s]  And dream about our battle of souls.
[18124.22s -> 18128.65s]  I want to see how you do once you're more evolved.
[18128.65s -> 18130.85s]  Something I'd like you to have, Grandpa.
[18130.85s -> 18131.77s]  This is the Death Force.
[18131.77s -> 18133.77s]  It's quite violent, perfect for you.
[18139.03s -> 18142.39s]  Okay, X.
[18142.39s -> 18144.39s]  Use its mysterious power to knock enemies back.
[18144.39s -> 18152.83s]  Unleash your, okay, so it was a knockback.
[18152.83s -> 18153.67s]  Okay, try it out.
[18165.23s -> 18167.07s]  Oh, all right, that's cool.
[18172.02s -> 18176.01s]  That's very useful.
[18176.05s -> 18192.54s]  It's just a force push.
[18192.54s -> 18197.59s]  Travis not being in Smash is a crime.
[18197.59s -> 18199.54s]  I don't know.
[18199.54s -> 18202.18s]  They've used mature games before.
[18202.18s -> 18205.66s]  Bayonetta.
[18205.66s -> 18208.50s]  And honestly, No More Heroes is just,
[18208.50s -> 18211.28s]  has been a Nintendo exclusive.
[18211.28s -> 18214.80s]  They've ported it years later to other platforms,
[18214.80s -> 18222.18s]  but it comes out on Nintendo platforms every time.
[18222.18s -> 18228.78s]  He's a Smash costume fighter.
[18228.78s -> 18230.50s]  By the way, have they ran out of character slots
[18230.50s -> 18233.10s]  to fit on the screen in Smash Brothers yet?
[18233.10s -> 18235.34s]  Or is that still, they still have enough room?
[18239.26s -> 18240.10s]  Okay, imagine what it takes.
[18240.10s -> 18242.66s]  Before we take each other on, I have a present for you.
[18242.66s -> 18244.42s]  There's literally one more left.
[18248.04s -> 18256.81s]  This is Death Rain.
[18256.81s -> 18259.81s]  Use its weird power to pour down a rain of pain.
[18259.81s -> 18262.29s]  So it's like a, okay, try it.
[18280.62s -> 18283.98s]  Ow, what just hit me?
[18283.98s -> 18285.34s]  I get hurt by my own shit?
[18295.96s -> 18300.14s]  Did I win?
[18300.14s -> 18301.70s]  Favorite burger from Burger King.
[18301.70s -> 18302.82s]  It's not a burger.
[18302.82s -> 18305.54s]  It's my favorite, it's the Burger King long chicken.
[18307.24s -> 18312.65s]  Who do you keep tossing out all this fucking foreshadowing?
[18312.65s -> 18316.02s]  I'll explain it all once I take you down.
[18316.02s -> 18317.70s]  Really talk a lot of shit.
[18317.70s -> 18320.70s]  This is where I actually start trying.
[18320.70s -> 18326.86s]  Good, get ready, grandpa.
[18326.86s -> 18332.27s]  Long chicken.
[18332.27s -> 18333.55s]  What's your damn mouth?
[18333.55s -> 18336.47s]  I'm not even close to being a grandpa yet.
[18336.47s -> 18339.15s]  Now it's time for a little spanking.
[18339.15s -> 18343.86s]  All right, time for the real fight.
[18343.86s -> 18345.66s]  Hey, that was not fair, okay?
[18345.66s -> 18353.13s]  I just like literally spawned in.
[18353.13s -> 18354.53s]  Those of you that are saying long chicken,
[18354.57s -> 18355.61s]  omega lol, question mark.
[18355.61s -> 18357.21s]  He's stupid, he's an idiot, long chicken.
[18357.21s -> 18358.93s]  What's long chicken?
[18358.93s -> 18359.77s]  That's not what it's called.
[18359.77s -> 18361.53s]  It's the original chicken sandwich.
[18361.53s -> 18362.89s]  Original chicken sandwich, Jermo.
[18362.89s -> 18366.05s]  What are you, stupid?
[18366.05s -> 18372.25s]  That's fine, that's okay.
[18372.25s -> 18378.66s]  That's completely fine.
[18378.66s -> 18380.22s]  No, that's fine, that's cool.
[18382.96s -> 18389.85s]  He's an idiot, stupid idiot.
[18389.85s -> 18392.45s]  What's that say?
[18392.45s -> 18393.53s]  What's that say?
[18393.53s -> 18400.08s]  Something on there text-wise?
[18400.08s -> 18406.25s]  Interesting.
[18406.25s -> 18411.84s]  What's starting at $20,000?
[18411.84s -> 18415.37s]  Is that rent?
[18415.37s -> 18416.69s]  What is that?
[18416.69s -> 18421.09s]  What is that?
[18421.09s -> 18422.81s]  I can't, I don't know what that is,
[18422.81s -> 18428.98s]  but I don't think I can afford that.
[18428.98s -> 18433.85s]  Holy shit.
[18433.85s -> 18437.78s]  That's not what that meant, right?
[18437.78s -> 18440.78s]  Oh my god, that's not a targeted ad.
[18440.78s -> 18443.18s]  No, I don't have that kind of fucking money.
[18447.86s -> 18449.66s]  Targeted advertising.
[18449.66s -> 18460.36s]  That's so stupid.
[18460.36s -> 18462.24s]  I would never, ever,
[18462.24s -> 18464.78s]  and I don't think that's what that was.
[18464.78s -> 18468.52s]  Was that like a dining room set?
[18468.52s -> 18470.82s]  I think that was like a yearly payment.
[18470.82s -> 18475.22s]  I have no idea, I have no clue.
[18475.74s -> 18478.82s]  How much is that a year?
[18478.82s -> 18480.74s]  Hold on a second.
[18480.74s -> 18481.82s]  I need to do a calculation.
[18481.82s -> 18483.62s]  I am so taken aback.
[18483.62s -> 18485.66s]  I don't even know what we're just looking at.
[18485.66s -> 18494.82s]  Hold on, this is important.
[18494.82s -> 18501.43s]  $240,000 a year for rent?
[18501.43s -> 18510.90s]  $20,000 a month?
[18510.90s -> 18521.50s]  Holy shit.
[18521.50s -> 18522.98s]  That's unbelievable.
[18523.86s -> 18526.13s]  I really thought that that was,
[18526.13s -> 18530.59s]  maybe, are we crazy?
[18530.59s -> 18531.59s]  Damn, that's, I don't,
[18531.59s -> 18533.15s]  got that money, if you got that kind of money,
[18533.15s -> 18538.58s]  whatever, that's not me.
[18538.58s -> 18549.17s]  That's a mogul move?
[18549.17s -> 18550.41s]  It's a targeted ad.
[18550.41s -> 18551.97s]  That's my, okay,
[18551.97s -> 18553.53s]  that's my top 10 favorite moment,
[18553.53s -> 18554.85s]  I think, that's ever happened on stream.
[18554.85s -> 18558.14s]  That's hilarious.
[18558.14s -> 18559.54s]  I don't even know what to say.
[18559.54s -> 18560.78s]  That's fucking hilarious.
[18569.67s -> 18570.51s]  All right, be easy.
[18570.51s -> 18578.21s]  Hold on.
[18578.21s -> 18579.29s]  I can't get over that.
[18579.29s -> 18580.69s]  I don't even know the,
[18580.69s -> 18581.85s]  wait, activate it.
[18586.33s -> 18587.89s]  Nice flex on your viewers.
[18587.89s -> 18599.60s]  I honestly, God, don't know why the fuck I got that.
[18599.60s -> 18604.38s]  Oh, I am bashing the shit out of this guy.
[18604.38s -> 18605.90s]  Oh, yep, yep.
[18605.90s -> 18611.56s]  Reign of hell.
[18611.56s -> 18612.72s]  You give me these crazy moves,
[18612.72s -> 18614.80s]  I'm just beating the shit out of this guy.
[18614.80s -> 18619.62s]  This guy doesn't stand a chance.
[18619.62s -> 18624.74s]  Rented a battery, that's what's making me have to leave.
[18624.74s -> 18625.58s]  Oh, what's that?
[18625.58s -> 18629.82s]  Oh, sorry.
[18629.82s -> 18637.58s]  Just get perfect dodged, is that what happened?
[18637.58s -> 18644.51s]  I'm embarrassing this guy right now.
[18644.51s -> 18657.15s]  Oh, that exploded, all right, whatever.
[18657.15s -> 18663.49s]  Oh, double.
[18663.49s -> 18665.19s]  You see that?
[18665.19s -> 18676.35s]  You paying attention?
[18676.35s -> 18678.39s]  Holy shit, I annihilated this guy.
[18689.82s -> 18705.90s]  All right, this three, I'm gonna be careful.
[18705.94s -> 18715.53s]  Oh shit, easy, easy, easy.
[18715.53s -> 18718.67s]  Oh, get cocky, there's no reason to be cocky.
[18722.28s -> 18727.71s]  That's fucking battery problem.
[18727.71s -> 18731.71s]  Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho.
[18735.81s -> 18752.46s]  Oh, see you later.
[18752.46s -> 18753.70s]  See you later, goodbye.
[18755.44s -> 18757.24s]  I know this guy's probably tutorial to teach you the moves,
[18757.24s -> 18769.83s]  but I had a good time on that one.
[18769.83s -> 18775.71s]  Not done yet.
[18775.71s -> 18776.79s]  That was quick.
[18776.79s -> 18778.03s]  Over there.
[18778.03s -> 18779.51s]  That's not gonna be a C rank, no way.
[18779.51s -> 18780.35s]  Not yet.
[18781.19s -> 18794.09s]  You gonna die on me without explaining all that bullshit?
[18794.09s -> 18797.09s]  Whatever, you can tell me in the next world.
[18799.05s -> 18800.09s]  Oh.
[18800.09s -> 18801.17s]  What the hell?
[18801.17s -> 18802.85s]  My katana won't budge.
[18806.88s -> 18810.06s]  I can't kill him?
[18810.06s -> 18813.17s]  That's gotta be S, right?
[18813.17s -> 18815.60s]  How?
[18815.60s -> 18816.84s]  I did everything so well.
[18816.84s -> 18821.17s]  I beat him in three minutes.
[18821.17s -> 18824.82s]  I beat that guy in three minutes.
[18824.82s -> 18837.20s]  It's a C.
[18837.20s -> 18839.92s]  Congratulations, you have been recognized
[18839.92s -> 18843.00s]  as number eight in the galactic rankings.
[18843.00s -> 18845.28s]  Looks like you're doing okay.
[18845.28s -> 18847.60s]  Hey, who the hell was that guy?
[18851.19s -> 18852.59s]  There is your answer.
[18852.59s -> 18855.07s]  Your body instinctively jumped into action,
[18855.07s -> 18857.99s]  trying to prevent his kid from getting hurt.
[18857.99s -> 18859.59s]  Why is that?
[18859.59s -> 18860.87s]  What the hell do you mean?
[18860.87s -> 18863.07s]  Someone starts to fall, you help them out.
[18863.07s -> 18865.47s]  Is this my son?
[18865.47s -> 18867.03s]  You are an assassin.
[18867.03s -> 18869.11s]  What are you doing helping people?
[18869.11s -> 18870.87s]  Have you ever helped out any of your other opponents?
[18870.87s -> 18872.31s]  Definitely my kid.
[18872.87s -> 18874.83s]  Why would someone as bloodthirsty as you
[18874.83s -> 18877.19s]  try to save another ranked assassin?
[18878.15s -> 18879.35s]  The reason is.
[18879.35s -> 18881.31s]  Is what?
[18881.31s -> 18882.79s]  A secret.
[18882.79s -> 18885.03s]  A secret guy, huh?
[18885.03s -> 18888.71s]  Whatever.
[18888.71s -> 18890.39s]  Go ahead and sleep here.
[18890.39s -> 18893.62s]  Rest it off.
[18893.62s -> 18897.74s]  I see you've gotten comfy in the Garden of Slaughter.
[18897.74s -> 18900.38s]  Now, Travis, go.
[18900.38s -> 18902.66s]  Off to swim the Sea of Blood.
[18904.02s -> 18909.34s]  Well, I'm really happy that they pulled the...
[18909.34s -> 18910.66s]  Here comes a boss.
[18910.66s -> 18912.42s]  Just kidding, someone's gonna kill that boss
[18912.42s -> 18916.97s]  and you fight somebody different for the third time.
[18916.97s -> 18920.30s]  They really love that joke.
[18920.30s -> 18928.25s]  They love it so much.
[18928.25s -> 18930.05s]  It's weird, because I'm just sitting here thinking,
[18930.05s -> 18932.53s]  which one of these guys are they gonna do that to?
[18932.53s -> 18937.98s]  So we got our answer.
[18937.98s -> 18956.85s]  It's like the fall joke for me, yeah?
[18956.85s -> 18962.89s]  20K.
[18962.89s -> 18971.52s]  No.
[18971.52s -> 18972.52s]  When are you gonna buy a mansion?
[18972.52s -> 18981.80s]  I'm not gonna buy a mansion.
[18981.80s -> 18983.76s]  Okay, the prospect is terrifying to me.
[18983.80s -> 18986.80s]  Look, and if you got money, you got money, right?
[18986.80s -> 18988.60s]  If you got a lot of money, if you got a lot of money,
[18988.60s -> 18989.44s]  do whatever you want.
[18989.44s -> 18990.48s]  Well, I don't give a shit, right?
[18990.48s -> 18994.74s]  But here's what scares me.
[18994.74s -> 18996.94s]  With an automatic payment coming out of my bank account
[18996.94s -> 19004.03s]  of more than $20,000 a month, that would give me anxiety.
[19004.03s -> 19007.64s]  20,000 automatic payment, right?
[19007.64s -> 19010.16s]  Like if it was like a mortgage or if it was like a rent,
[19010.16s -> 19014.24s]  that scares the shit out of me.
[19014.24s -> 19016.56s]  I would never want an auto payment to be more than
[19016.56s -> 19021.16s]  like a few thousand dollars a month, ever, for any reason.
[19021.20s -> 19022.44s]  I don't care how much money I have.
[19022.44s -> 19027.97s]  That's like terrifying to me.
[19027.97s -> 19030.49s]  In my personal opinion, that I would be scared
[19030.49s -> 19032.13s]  of that much money coming out of my checking account
[19032.13s -> 19048.56s]  on an automatic basis.
[19048.56s -> 19055.46s]  Well, you can afford the long check-in, yeah.
[19055.46s -> 19065.16s]  Just don't check your balance.
[19065.16s -> 19070.94s]  If you had that much, just put it towards the house.
[19070.94s -> 19073.50s]  Yeah, I don't know if I would rent for that much.
[19073.50s -> 19074.74s]  That's a lot of money.
[19077.95s -> 19079.91s]  That's a huge amount of money for rent.
[19090.73s -> 19092.81s]  Can you really kill this guy?
[19092.81s -> 19096.14s]  Shut up!
[19096.14s -> 19099.73s]  Sorry, I got a bit overexcited.
[19099.73s -> 19100.73s]  Listen, Damon.
[19100.73s -> 19101.89s]  I love that underwear he has.
[19101.89s -> 19103.13s]  This is a game.
[19103.13s -> 19105.57s]  Unless someone shows up to challenge me,
[19105.57s -> 19108.01s]  the game doesn't work.
[19108.01s -> 19110.09s]  Your guest has arrived.
[19110.09s -> 19112.41s]  Missed their vanishing point.
[19112.41s -> 19114.01s]  Good, let him in.
[19114.01s -> 19114.85s]  All right.
[19115.73s -> 19117.09s]  RGB underwear.
[19129.26s -> 19130.10s]  Hey, French.
[19131.06s -> 19132.93s]  You killed this guy?
[19133.69s -> 19134.85s]  Hell yeah.
[19134.85s -> 19136.89s]  Who do you think you're talking to?
[19136.89s -> 19138.93s]  You seem confident enough.
[19138.93s -> 19140.25s]  Just watch me.
[19140.25s -> 19142.53s]  I'm gonna kill the shit out of you.
[19142.53s -> 19144.25s]  Show me a good time.
[19144.25s -> 19146.41s]  Anything you say, Prince.
[19146.41s -> 19147.25s]  Nice.
[19154.84s -> 19157.23s]  Love how every episode starts.
[19157.23s -> 19159.11s]  Just going to the throne room.
[19159.11s -> 19160.75s]  Just see this weird back and forth
[19160.75s -> 19162.71s]  between the new weird character
[19162.71s -> 19169.49s]  that's being introduced.
[19169.49s -> 19185.38s]  They are giving off a second life DBZ universe, aren't they?
[19186.63s -> 19187.87s]  Let's get to the save point.
[19187.87s -> 19189.07s]  If there's another cutscene, we'll watch it
[19189.07s -> 19191.07s]  and then we're gonna pick it up tomorrow.
[19206.74s -> 19213.27s]  That's it.
[19213.27s -> 19214.91s]  Got some new clothes.
[19214.91s -> 19219.22s]  New T-shirt.
[19219.22s -> 19220.54s]  Play with Gene and then I'm gonna save it
[19220.54s -> 19222.86s]  and we'll pick it up tomorrow.
[19227.95s -> 19229.79s]  Thanks for watching, everybody.
[19229.79s -> 19231.98s]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[19231.98s -> 19240.27s]  Around the same time, around four o'clock.
[19240.27s -> 19241.99s]  We definitely did not get halfway through the game,
[19241.99s -> 19244.71s]  but I think this game's amazing.
[19244.71s -> 19247.72s]  I'm having a ton of fun with it.
[19247.72s -> 19252.86s]  So I, if this has to be like three streams, that's fine.
[19252.86s -> 19254.26s]  We'll do one tomorrow and see how we feel
[19254.26s -> 19256.54s]  and maybe do another one.
[19256.54s -> 19259.48s]  If not, then we'll pick it up like,
[19259.48s -> 19260.44s]  but here's the thing.
[19260.44s -> 19263.26s]  I'm gonna be staying on the Switch
[19263.26s -> 19266.84s]  because yeah, this will work out fine.
[19266.84s -> 19268.70s]  So we're gonna stream tomorrow
[19268.70s -> 19271.60s]  and then however, wherever we get tomorrow,
[19271.60s -> 19273.88s]  on the 10th, the new WarioWare comes out.
[19273.88s -> 19275.40s]  You better believe I'm gonna play the absolute hell
[19275.40s -> 19277.22s]  out of that on Friday.
[19277.22s -> 19279.59s]  So maybe we could do like a Friday, Saturday,
[19279.63s -> 19282.39s]  which would be, or Friday, Sunday or something,
[19282.39s -> 19286.17s]  which would be WarioWare and then I'll finish No More Heroes.
[19286.17s -> 19293.11s]  I think that'll work out perfectly.
[19293.11s -> 19294.35s]  So let's pick it up.
[19294.35s -> 19298.61s]  I'm gonna be exactly where I'm standing right now.
[19298.61s -> 19302.99s]  We'll check it out tomorrow.
[19302.99s -> 19305.90s]  Sims 3, Sims 3 will be probably another week or two.
[19305.90s -> 19308.49s]  I wanna play WarioWare.
[19308.49s -> 19310.57s]  So I have all the mods done.
[19310.57s -> 19311.41s]  They're all installed.
[19311.41s -> 19312.23s]  They're ready to go.
[19312.23s -> 19319.71s]  I just have to do it.
[19319.71s -> 19325.86s]  I got like seven mods installed and they're all insane.
[19325.86s -> 19328.12s]  Thanks for watching, everybody.
[19328.12s -> 19329.24s]  There was a lot of community subs.
[19329.24s -> 19331.12s]  Oh, the sunflowers, yes.
[19331.16s -> 19335.47s]  There will be a sunflower reveal tomorrow.
[19335.47s -> 19344.29s]  You better believe it.
[19344.29s -> 19345.65s]  Yeah, there were a lot of community subs.
[19345.65s -> 19348.09s]  There was like 50 community subs given
[19348.09s -> 19351.52s]  in like 10, 10, 10, 10.
[19351.52s -> 19354.76s]  When I looked at the sub count after the all-house stream,
[19354.76s -> 19360.77s]  I remember, I did not think it was gonna be that high.
[19360.77s -> 19364.19s]  We have smashed every record I ever held on this channel
[19364.19s -> 19371.51s]  for subscriptions.
[19371.51s -> 19373.74s]  It's quite a lot.
[19373.74s -> 19375.54s]  The record of the channel was,
[19375.54s -> 19377.97s]  and I'll be upfront with you,
[19377.97s -> 19382.39s]  record of the channel was 12,800 subscriptions.
[19382.39s -> 19385.31s]  Now, I know that this is not gonna be this high
[19385.31s -> 19387.78s]  probably in 30 days from now,
[19387.78s -> 19388.62s]  but this is, like I said,
[19388.62s -> 19391.41s]  I'm gonna be chasing highs for the rest of my life.
[19391.41s -> 19396.11s]  100K viewers, like all this shit that had a lot of people.
[19396.11s -> 19398.45s]  I think the peak the day after the stream
[19398.45s -> 19401.65s]  was about 17,400 subscriptions,
[19401.65s -> 19404.53s]  which is like, are you kidding me?
[19404.53s -> 19407.63s]  I do not expect that to continue
[19407.63s -> 19409.19s]  because obviously a lot of that might be just people
[19409.19s -> 19411.63s]  that primed or that gave during the stream,
[19411.63s -> 19413.07s]  whatever that stream,
[19413.07s -> 19417.06s]  but that's 20k rent money.
[19417.06s -> 19419.90s]  Targeting network.
[19421.93s -> 19428.12s]  Yeah, it's, I can't, it's insane.
[19428.12s -> 19432.26s]  So, regardless if we stay up here at this,
[19432.26s -> 19434.18s]  and I'm saying we, right?
[19434.18s -> 19436.06s]  But you know what I mean.
[19436.06s -> 19442.23s]  Regardless if 17,000 subs is the highest it ever goes ever,
[19442.23s -> 19445.00s]  and we pull back quite a bit maybe,
[19445.00s -> 19448.17s]  that's an achievement that I never thought I'd see.
[19448.17s -> 19449.57s]  We, I mean, do you remember like a year ago
[19449.57s -> 19451.99s]  during one of the,
[19451.99s -> 19454.01s]  I think it was the New Year's Eve stream,
[19454.01s -> 19457.46s]  I broke 10,000 subs for the first time.
[19457.46s -> 19460.36s]  When I went to bed that night,
[19461.30s -> 19462.14s]  I was like, this is,
[19462.14s -> 19463.65s]  I'm never crossing this ever again.
[19463.65s -> 19464.65s]  I remember just like lying in bed,
[19464.65s -> 19465.77s]  just staring at the ceiling being like,
[19465.77s -> 19468.16s]  this is never happening again.
[19468.16s -> 19473.61s]  There's no way I stay over that.
[19473.61s -> 19477.32s]  I am, I know I'm saying that again right now.
[19477.32s -> 19478.70s]  Parasocial Andy.
[19482.51s -> 19489.40s]  But I get, I don't know, just thanks.
[19489.40s -> 19491.36s]  Hopefully I can spend the money well
[19491.36s -> 19495.60s]  and not on, not on that insane rent.
[19495.60s -> 19497.84s]  Don't worry.
[19497.84s -> 19506.95s]  Just do dollhouse quality streams every day.
[19506.95s -> 19509.71s]  No, I just, I don't want people to think
[19509.71s -> 19512.66s]  I'm trying to be like, look at how many subs I have now.
[19512.66s -> 19514.22s]  I just, it's a bit shocking
[19514.22s -> 19516.10s]  that this many people would even do it in the first place.
[19516.10s -> 19520.38s]  So, cause I talked about it before
[19520.38s -> 19521.90s]  and I kind of would like to be
[19521.90s -> 19525.38s]  a little more transparent about it.
[19525.38s -> 19532.97s]  I wouldn't like hide it or anything, but thank you.
[19532.97s -> 19534.09s]  We'll see where it goes.
[19534.09s -> 19538.07s]  Let's see what streams can happen
[19538.07s -> 19540.46s]  because of different opportunities, right?
[19540.46s -> 19543.47s]  The more money that I make, the more I'm going to use.
[19543.47s -> 19545.17s]  And we've had sponsors,
[19545.17s -> 19547.67s]  we've had involvement from Twitch, right?
[19547.67s -> 19548.51s]  So I don't know.
[19548.51s -> 19550.07s]  I'm hoping to continue to do stuff
[19550.07s -> 19551.23s]  like you saw a couple of weeks ago,
[19551.23s -> 19554.94s]  the last week or whatever.
[19554.94s -> 19559.96s]  Let's give it a shot.
[19559.96s -> 19560.80s]  Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.
[19560.80s -> 19562.08s]  Thanks for watching everybody.
[19562.08s -> 19563.28s]  Have a great rest of your night.
[19563.28s -> 19565.56s]  It's probably pretty late for a lot of you
[19565.56s -> 19571.72s]  considering it's 9.30 PST right now, or PT, whatever.
[19571.72s -> 19573.05s]  See you tomorrow.
[19573.05s -> 19574.71s]  Good night, guys.
[19574.71s -> 19621.29s]  Take care of yourselves.
