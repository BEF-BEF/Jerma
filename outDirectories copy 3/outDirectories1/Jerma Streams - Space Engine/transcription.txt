[1.85s -> 9.64s]  Uh oh. Already? I just... I just started. Why would I be doing this?
[9.64s -> 21.62s]  Let's hope that was just a little bump. Weird, but anyways, hi guys.
[21.62s -> 34.01s]  It's a clay... ooh. Uh oh. Classic Jerma stream, yeah. Well, hi everybody.
[34.01s -> 46.52s]  I'm back. Just waiting to see if this is... I might have to change
[46.52s -> 52.60s]  Twitch servers again. Am I gonna have to do that? I probably will.
[52.60s -> 64.44s]  Oh, this is really bad. What a good comeback after
[64.44s -> 67.72s]  a week of not streaming. And we got a lot to talk about too.
[67.72s -> 79.56s]  But anyways, hi. Uh, I have returned from about eight days of being absent.
[79.56s -> 83.24s]  Got a lot to talk about. There's a lot to do.
[83.24s -> 91.67s]  And hopefully we can straighten out the internet here for a minute.
[91.67s -> 95.43s]  Any news on the work that blored out? There's a lot of news. We got...
[95.43s -> 99.59s]  This stream is not even gonna be a stream. This is gonna be like a
[99.75s -> 108.28s]  news broadcast. So welcome back to the non-stream.
[108.28s -> 115.19s]  And I want to play this game Space Engine because it's kind of one of those
[115.19s -> 118.15s]  experiences where you just can travel the universe.
[118.15s -> 126.18s]  So we can talk, travel the universe. I'm ready. What's wrong with Space Engine?
[126.18s -> 130.98s]  Is it bad? I heard it was pretty good. This was
[130.98s -> 135.48s]  highly requested. It was in the Jerma985 Discord
[135.48s -> 141.62s]  recommended channel. So I mean, come on. You don't think
[141.62s -> 146.49s]  that I'd look at that? Anyways, before we really get started,
[146.49s -> 148.81s]  there's a few things that need to be said.
[148.81s -> 152.89s]  First of all, God, I love you. Can we just say that?
[152.89s -> 156.26s]  I gotta like, I gotta soften the blow here. You know,
[156.26s -> 161.22s]  you're just fantastic. Hold on, did you do something with
[161.22s -> 166.25s]  your hair? It looks different today. I like it. It looks good.
[166.25s -> 170.97s]  Wait, did you get an A plus? Good. Good. If you got a B, that's fine
[170.97s -> 174.65s]  too. I don't care. As long as you try.
[175.99s -> 180.49s]  All right, now that I softened the blow, I softened you a little bit.
[180.49s -> 186.76s]  All right, here we go. Over the next two months or so,
[186.76s -> 193.99s]  I am going to be dialing back streams. Instead of four days a week,
[193.99s -> 197.19s]  probably going to be more like two or three days a week
[197.19s -> 201.02s]  for the next couple of months. And I'll tell you why.
[201.02s -> 204.46s]  The carnival stream, if you don't know what that is,
[204.46s -> 208.14s]  is pretty much getting into full motion here.
[208.14s -> 212.94s]  And this stream is going to be the biggest thing I've ever done.
[212.94s -> 217.77s]  And it's going to happen before the end of September.
[217.77s -> 223.53s]  We are trying our hardest. This is not going to be just a little
[223.53s -> 228.84s]  dunk tank stream. This is going to be an incredibly elaborate experience.
[228.84s -> 235.34s]  So I gotta put the time in necessary to get it done.
[235.34s -> 239.34s]  And there's a lot of potential travel back and forth from a few places
[239.42s -> 244.68s]  that I may or may not have to do over the next couple of months.
[244.68s -> 248.12s]  But streams are going to be, essentially I'm going to be splitting
[248.12s -> 253.16s]  time between live streaming and working on this project.
[253.16s -> 258.23s]  Because I'm going full speed ahead. As of like this next week,
[258.23s -> 262.89s]  I'm going to try to go full speed ahead, whatever it takes.
[262.89s -> 272.38s]  Also, also the green screen encore night is Saturday.
[272.38s -> 278.17s]  For those of you that don't know, we've been talking about it for a few weeks.
[278.17s -> 284.36s]  If you have something ready, there is a form
[284.36s -> 289.53s]  that you have to submit your video to. This is happening on Saturday, so if
[289.53s -> 292.23s]  you got something, you got to submit it here.
[292.23s -> 296.23s]  Please use this form to submit your green screen
[296.23s -> 300.31s]  encore video. It is not, oh video, I swallowed my tongue there.
[300.31s -> 304.79s]  That was like video it. I was just like fucking puked.
[304.79s -> 309.46s]  That was weird. Anyways, so when you submit your
[309.46s -> 312.98s]  green screen, I haven't been on stream for like a week, come on.
[312.98s -> 317.78s]  When you submit your green screen video, keep in mind it has to be
[317.78s -> 321.59s]  under three minutes. Try to get it under three minutes.
[321.59s -> 326.79s]  We are making exceptions for some pieces of content.
[326.79s -> 330.31s]  But for the main part, don't like just throw up like a 30 minute video.
[330.31s -> 335.54s]  It's not going to be shown. Also, not every video is going to be
[335.54s -> 339.62s]  shown. Instead of this being a six to seven
[339.62s -> 343.06s]  hour, almost every submission is accepted,
[343.06s -> 349.45s]  we're going to take like the top submissions, ones that the mod team
[349.45s -> 354.12s]  and me, I'll be involved in this process as well, we'll be picking them.
[354.12s -> 357.40s]  So we really want this to be just like an encore presentation with some
[357.40s -> 361.64s]  of the really good ones and not like a 400 video,
[361.64s -> 371.02s]  seven hour live stream. So I'm, when I say I'm involved too,
[371.02s -> 374.68s]  I'm not going to watch every single video before the stream, but we're
[374.68s -> 377.80s]  talking like if there's a case where I need to come in and take a look,
[377.80s -> 381.96s]  the mods are going to do a really good job of sifting through
[381.96s -> 387.61s]  whatever is submitted. Get your submission in
[387.61s -> 394.39s]  before tomorrow night. Try. If you don't get it done and it's like
[394.39s -> 397.43s]  Saturday morning and you're like just finishing something,
[397.43s -> 401.03s]  then you can still submit it. I think we don't really have
[401.51s -> 407.27s]  a hard, hard limit, but if you don't get your submission in by like Friday night,
[407.27s -> 410.70s]  Saturday morning, it's not going to happen. You know
[410.70s -> 413.10s]  what I'm saying? It just isn't. There's just no way we're going to be able to
[413.10s -> 419.06s]  get it in there that quickly. And this is not designed to be like
[419.06s -> 422.74s]  a scenario where, oh, hurry up and make something crazy. This is just for
[422.74s -> 426.10s]  if you had something already, if something was already done, or if
[426.10s -> 428.18s]  you were working on something and you didn't finish it, or you had a
[428.18s -> 434.30s]  couple videos, or one video. That's what this is for. This is
[434.30s -> 439.85s]  not another full-on movie night. It's an extra
[439.85s -> 444.76s]  night, if you know what I'm saying. And that's Saturday at the regular time.
[444.76s -> 449.94s]  So today, tomorrow, and into Saturday, we're going to do some other stuff.
[449.94s -> 453.06s]  Mario Maker comes out tomorrow. Mario Maker 2, right?
[453.06s -> 456.65s]  Maybe we'll play that. But tonight we're going to just play Space Engine
[456.65s -> 460.34s]  and talk about this stuff. Because there's a lot to talk about.
[460.34s -> 463.10s]  Wasn't there a third thing? What was the third thing?
[463.10s -> 470.42s]  What was the third thing? Anybody know what the third thing was? There was a
[470.42s -> 478.14s]  third thing. Shit. What was the third thing? There
[478.14s -> 487.90s]  was a third important thing. The carnival fucking twitch place
[487.90s -> 492.34s]  carnival stream. The fact that streams are going to be
[492.34s -> 494.95s]  pulled back a little bit over the next couple months.
[494.95s -> 502.63s]  Encore movie night. No, I'm not pregnant. It'll come to me.
[502.63s -> 508.07s]  Don't worry. Let's get this on here. And this is a tad loud, so we're
[508.07s -> 520.10s]  going to turn it down. He's trying. I'm not pregnant. If I'm
[520.10s -> 525.24s]  pregnant, then I get Disney World. I think that's good. Maybe a little
[525.24s -> 531.24s]  more. Should we do it at one? I think that's all right. That sounds
[531.24s -> 538.73s]  okay. We can turn it up. I have no idea what's going to happen in this game. All
[538.73s -> 542.94s]  I know is we're going to just browse around.
[542.94s -> 546.78s]  How did you not use... Oh, I was going to read that out loud.
[546.78s -> 549.42s]  All right. I haven't played it yet, so I don't know what I'm
[549.42s -> 555.56s]  continuing. I'm going to take you guys to my
[555.56s -> 573.21s]  house. This is like Google Earth. What planet is this? So this is
[573.21s -> 583.91s]  Earth? What the fuck happened? What year is this? This is like 2845?
[583.91s -> 589.59s]  This is all fucking like toxic. Oh, I don't even want to know what the
[589.59s -> 594.78s]  fuck happened here. Let me look at some of the... How do I
[594.78s -> 600.34s]  play this game? Is there like a tutorial? Tools? Video capture? Planet
[600.34s -> 607.66s]  editor? I can make my own planet? I can make like a Minecraft skin?
[607.66s -> 612.49s]  Wait, I can just go anywhere? I don't need any instructions.
[612.49s -> 619.32s]  Oh yeah! Interface. Hey, I'll see you in like fucking four hours.
[619.32s -> 621.72s]  Welcome to Space Engine. This tutorial will introduce you to Space Engine's
[621.72s -> 626.86s]  interface. There's Earth. What's all the whipped cream,
[626.86s -> 629.82s]  though? What is that? This is our planet Earth. The table in the upper left
[629.82s -> 632.62s]  corner of the screen displays various information about the planet, like
[632.62s -> 637.64s]  radius, length of day, gravity, and so on. Don't minus two me on that. Come
[637.64s -> 642.17s]  on. That was like kind of funny. It was like a latte.
[647.32s -> 651.32s]  All right. It was kind of a bad joke, but whatever. Up in the corner of the
[651.32s -> 655.98s]  screen displays radius, life, organic, multicellular,
[655.98s -> 665.30s]  marine and terrestrial life, mass, one me, ESI-1, apparent mag, 21
[665.30s -> 672.28s]  phase, apparent size, 21 degrees by 40, 54 degrees by 47 inches by 62 feet.
[672.28s -> 679.93s]  Okay. One year is the orbital period. Rotation period is 23 hours 56 minutes.
[679.93s -> 685.54s]  Age. How old is the Earth? This is 4.5 years.
[685.54s -> 694.36s]  The Earth is 4.5 years old times 10 times 9. 10 times 9, 10 times.
[694.36s -> 699.30s]  I don't know. That's like a square root. Gravity, one gram.
[699.30s -> 702.26s]  The sea's composition of Earth is hydrogen
[702.26s -> 709.05s]  and salt. The atmosphere is nitrogen, oxygen, and air. The atmospheric pressure
[709.05s -> 711.85s]  is one atom. The temperature is 15 degrees Celsius.
[711.85s -> 716.89s]  The greenhouse effect is 33. The number of moons is one. Cool. Okay.
[716.89s -> 720.09s]  Interesting. If you left click on any visible object on the screen, Space
[720.09s -> 725.00s]  Engine will select it and displays information about it. Click any star.
[725.00s -> 730.78s]  Any star. Choose any star. I could choose any car.
[730.78s -> 736.49s]  Okay. This one. Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice.
[736.49s -> 743.29s]  Uh-oh. Don't say it a third time. Now you can read info about the newly
[743.29s -> 747.56s]  selected object. Tiny rotating arrows indicate which object
[747.56s -> 749.96s]  is selected. It is called selection pointer.
[749.96s -> 753.08s]  Yeah. Select the Earth again by left clicking on it. All right. So can we go
[753.08s -> 759.21s]  there? Look at all these toolbars. They have
[759.21s -> 761.85s]  plenty of useful options, some of which have hotkeys.
[761.85s -> 765.21s]  Hover the mouse to cursor over any icon to see the hint about its function.
[765.21s -> 771.16s]  There's a lot of shit going on. Universe map. Solar system browser.
[771.16s -> 779.54s]  Chart. Star browser. Find object. Is there a star named after me?
[779.54s -> 782.90s]  You guys remember that scam where you could like name a star
[782.90s -> 788.18s]  after somebody? Oh, it's called name a star after your
[788.18s -> 791.74s]  loved one for like an anniversary present. Remember that scam?
[791.74s -> 800.44s]  Anybody have that done? Like, does anybody have that done so we can find
[800.44s -> 809.16s]  you? No, I'm not. I'm not a boomer. I remember
[809.16s -> 814.90s]  hearing those on the radio. When your wife knows that you named
[814.90s -> 819.78s]  a star after her, she will be so happy when your
[819.78s -> 822.74s]  husband comes in after a long day of work and you tell him that you
[822.74s -> 826.90s]  named him after what is effectively a fucking crumb
[826.90s -> 831.32s]  in the sky out of trillions of them. He's gonna be so
[831.32s -> 844.09s]  happy with you. Alright, spacecraft manager. I don't have one.
[844.09s -> 848.49s]  Journey. Log. Locations. Display. I don't want to do that. What if it shows
[848.49s -> 851.54s]  where I am? Settings. Is that gonna do like a
[851.54s -> 856.58s]  google flag at like my house? I'm scared to press this.
[856.58s -> 862.01s]  This is like a video player. Spacecraft mode.
[862.01s -> 867.90s]  Aircraft mode. Okay, this is like kind of cool. Alright,
[867.90s -> 871.26s]  so there's a lot of functions here. High dynamic range. The left toolbar,
[871.26s -> 873.26s]  also called the main toolbar, gives you access to all basic functions of
[873.26s -> 876.86s]  space. Clicking on any icon opens a special dialogue window. Click, for
[876.86s -> 884.92s]  example, this blinking icon. Is that gonna show my location? So you
[884.92s -> 889.26s]  can see everything about earth. Physical. This is cool.
[889.26s -> 892.86s]  You don't flash me. You may rotate the planet preview in the wiki
[892.86s -> 895.90s]  windows by holding the left or right mouse button and dragging your mouse.
[895.90s -> 899.26s]  Try this now. What happened to the back of the
[899.26s -> 903.59s]  earth? It's like this is like torched. What
[903.59s -> 908.57s]  happened? Wiki also informs you if the
[908.57s -> 915.80s]  selected object is real or not. Space engine has thousands of real
[915.80s -> 920.76s]  objects and billions of billions of procedurally generated by programs.
[920.76s -> 924.04s]  Objects in the uncharted regions of the universe.
[924.04s -> 927.00s]  This line can help you identify the object,
[927.00s -> 933.98s]  the type of object. So this is a real earth.
[933.98s -> 938.65s]  Does that mean there's a fake earth? Click the gear icon. It opens the
[938.65s -> 942.82s]  settings menu. Yeah, almost everything you can
[942.82s -> 945.46s]  configure. The settings menu has multiple tabs, each of which groups
[945.46s -> 949.22s]  settings by their uses. Graphics. Yeah, graphics. You can
[949.22s -> 952.82s]  tweak anything else. Simulations such as visual style,
[952.82s -> 956.82s]  depending on your taste using other tabs. Bottom left toolbar also called
[956.82s -> 959.30s]  navigation toolbar shows movement anytime.
[959.30s -> 963.22s]  As useful options such as flying automatically to a selected object.
[963.22s -> 969.38s]  Sick. Change in free flight speed and setting date. All icons on this
[969.38s -> 972.82s]  toolbar act immediately, i.e. don't open any dialogue
[972.82s -> 977.67s]  windows. All right. Sick. So this is like traveling and
[977.67s -> 982.07s]  speed and sound. The bottom right toolbar is also called the camera
[982.07s -> 985.19s]  toolbar. Has an options to change the overall
[985.19s -> 989.03s]  scene brightness. Exposure. Sick. And the limiting stellar magnitude of
[989.03s -> 992.47s]  galaxies, stars, and planets. It also controls the current field of
[992.47s -> 999.90s]  view. Oh, that's kind of cool. What's this one?
[999.90s -> 1002.94s]  What do these fireworks do? Increase magnitude.
[1002.94s -> 1005.75s]  Magnitude. Wait, is this gonna like this? Is this gravity? Am I gonna like
[1005.75s -> 1011.59s]  fucking implode the earth? What does that mean? What does that do?
[1011.59s -> 1014.63s]  Is this gonna start like morphing, breaking, and ripping apart?
[1016.49s -> 1021.70s]  I don't want to do it. Filters has an option to hide and show some types of
[1021.70s -> 1026.12s]  objects. And okay, this is the filtering objects.
[1026.12s -> 1029.64s]  For example, you may hide stars to observe the Milky Way or hide clouds
[1029.64s -> 1037.67s]  on a planet to observe its surface. Hide galaxies. Hide stars. Oh.
[1037.67s -> 1046.14s]  Hide clusters. Hide nebula. Planets. This is so cool. Hide water. What
[1046.14s -> 1048.62s]  happened? Oh, what happened? Where did the
[1048.62s -> 1057.94s]  water go? Okay, I'm just realizing that was like as if you guys were
[1057.94s -> 1060.95s]  like three. You guys, I've been hanging, let me tell you
[1060.95s -> 1063.40s]  something, I've been hanging out with a lot of children
[1063.40s -> 1069.48s]  over the last week. So I saw my family, nieces and nephews, and like that's
[1069.48s -> 1072.36s]  funny to them. Like if I were to get rid of the water,
[1072.36s -> 1075.56s]  well where'd the water go? Like so there's gonna be some like kid humor
[1075.56s -> 1080.55s]  today. So I've been, I think my nieces and nephews like thought that
[1080.55s -> 1083.02s]  just think that kind of shit is funny.
[1083.02s -> 1086.50s]  So sorry. That's not gonna happen though. Let's get the clouds back here.
[1086.50s -> 1091.58s]  Well, without the clouds, this really looks like dumb.
[1091.58s -> 1095.61s]  Oh clouds. Without the clouds, the atmosphere,
[1095.61s -> 1101.69s]  any comet trails, any uh auras or yeah this looks like stupid without
[1101.69s -> 1107.66s]  like all this cool stuff on it. Wow what a boring shit planet. I want
[1107.66s -> 1111.74s]  to move. You know what I'm saying? All right, that's cool. For example, this
[1111.74s -> 1114.86s]  icon toggles the displaying of constellations. Click it now, although you
[1114.86s -> 1122.87s]  can also press x. Constellations. Oh I gotta find me. I gotta
[1122.87s -> 1146.70s]  find me. Where am I? What are these constellations?
[1147.50s -> 1152.62s]  Octans? Mensa? Chameleon? This is a chameleon constellation, is there?
[1152.62s -> 1160.98s]  There's a puppy? Where's me? I don't, I want to find me.
[1163.11s -> 1174.94s]  Phoenix? Arizona? I don't think Phoenix is that way.
[1174.94s -> 1184.95s]  Capricorn? Sagittarius? Where is my character? Hercules?
[1184.95s -> 1187.75s]  There's a, I don't, there's no, is a Hercules constellation?
[1188.39s -> 1199.85s]  Is it booty? Ursa Minor? Where's Ursa Major?
[1199.85s -> 1203.74s]  Okay, this is freaking me out. Where is my character? Dude,
[1203.74s -> 1208.38s]  I saw a fucking pretty sick game. Make a fighting game
[1209.24s -> 1215.91s]  with all the constellations. I said it first so if anybody does it I get 10%
[1215.91s -> 1222.63s]  of all the revenue. All right, I have no idea what my,
[1222.63s -> 1227.14s]  what my character is. So we're just gonna move on.
[1231.27s -> 1236.94s]  Constellation Battle Royale. Now I don't know where it is.
[1236.94s -> 1245.64s]  Oh well. Wait. Where's the Earth? What happened to the Earth?
[1245.64s -> 1250.68s]  Oh there it is. Oh thank god. Imagine being in like a spaceship
[1250.68s -> 1254.47s]  and you go up there you're an astronaut and just spinning around with like a
[1254.47s -> 1257.46s]  camera looking around. Where the fuck did it go?
[1257.46s -> 1264.18s]  I don't know where it is. Hopefully we just turn us around a little.
[1264.18s -> 1267.62s]  Okay you can unlock the main toolbar by ticking the small
[1267.62s -> 1272.50s]  pin in the bottom corner. It is blinking red to help you spot it.
[1272.50s -> 1277.54s]  So these little pins here. Now if you move the mouse it will go away.
[1277.54s -> 1280.90s]  That's cool. So they come back when you get close enough. Cool.
[1280.90s -> 1287.08s]  Let's do it to all of them. All right, this is pretty cool. You can
[1287.08s -> 1298.50s]  click the pin icon and keeps it there. Two bottom toolbars have a half hide or
[1298.50s -> 1304.31s]  half lock option. Tick the pin icon on the navigation
[1304.31s -> 1310.87s]  toolbar and see what will happen. Isn't that what I just did? Navigation
[1310.87s -> 1314.58s]  is down here. Now if you move mouse away from the
[1314.58s -> 1317.24s]  toolbar it'll hide only the bottom half,
[1317.24s -> 1320.44s]  leaving only essential information such as the current time visible. Okay what
[1320.44s -> 1325.48s]  so what time is it? 12? 18? 17? I want 12 hour.
[1325.48s -> 1330.68s]  I can't read that. I don't know what that means. Now hide it completely
[1330.68s -> 1336.81s]  by ticking the pin again. Cool. All right now we're going to
[1336.81s -> 1339.61s]  learn how to navigate space. Are you guys ready for like
[1339.61s -> 1350.58s]  look at this shit? Yeah you won't be here all day.
[1350.58s -> 1354.10s]  Streamer can't read a clock. I just don't do 24 hour time.
[1354.10s -> 1359.38s]  This tutorial will teach you basic controls and navigation. Okay I'm
[1359.38s -> 1362.47s]  going to do this real quick. Here we go.
[1362.47s -> 1365.75s]  You may look around using the mouse by left drag. Okay.
[1365.75s -> 1371.05s]  Look around by left drag. Hold that button and move the mouse.
[1371.05s -> 1383.05s]  It's kind of takes some. So that'd be being. So that'd take that long.
[1383.05s -> 1394.15s]  I guess I am in space right? What about right click?
[1394.15s -> 1408.33s]  DPI? No look at this. Okay is it my FOV? Go to my. I'm gonna take
[1408.33s -> 1411.37s]  you guys to my house. I promise once I get an opportunity.
[1411.37s -> 1416.79s]  You have aircraft movement on. It's dull.
[1416.79s -> 1434.78s]  What? Are you sure? Oh Jesus. Um how do I turn them off? Spacecraft
[1434.82s -> 1440.10s]  mode? I mean I clearly know how to move the left
[1440.10s -> 1446.01s]  mouse. I know how to do this. Can I get another tutorial here?
[1446.01s -> 1452.12s]  I have to stay in free flight mode. Free mode.
[1452.12s -> 1456.07s]  This is free mode. What the hell is going on?
[1456.07s -> 1460.07s]  Did you notice the sun? Turn around to see it. The sun is highlighted with
[1460.07s -> 1462.55s]  the selection pointer which we viewed in the previous
[1462.55s -> 1466.39s]  tutorial. If an object is outside the screen's edge the indicator arrows
[1466.39s -> 1468.55s]  will move in that direction of the object. Move your view towards the
[1468.55s -> 1470.79s]  arrow to get that. Wow I don't look right at the sun.
[1470.79s -> 1477.08s]  Did somebody give a hundred dollars? Holy shit somebody gave a hundred bucks like
[1477.08s -> 1480.78s]  five minutes ago. First let me look at the sun and
[1480.78s -> 1484.73s]  hurt myself. How long can you do it for? How long
[1484.73s -> 1491.32s]  can you do it for? One. Two. Three. Four. Ow! I did it for
[1491.32s -> 1501.45s]  four seconds. But our Tingy. Thank you Tingy for the
[1501.45s -> 1509.96s]  hundred bucks. Child humor. It's doing more kid humor.
[1509.96s -> 1513.00s]  Hey you want to know how to do kid humor? Here you go.
[1513.00s -> 1522.55s]  Here's the foolproof way to make any kid laugh. Did you get hurt? That's it.
[1522.55s -> 1527.48s]  That's pretty much all you need to do. Did you get hurt or did you surprise
[1527.48s -> 1538.28s]  them? That's it. Like if I walk and like
[1538.28s -> 1543.32s]  and like oh I bumped my knee. Oh ow! It's like
[1544.20s -> 1547.32s]  that was not a kid. That was I don't know what that was.
[1547.32s -> 1552.73s]  I don't know what that was supposed to be. That was not a kid.
[1552.73s -> 1559.53s]  Anyways Tingy. That was an imp. That was a fucking goblin. Thank you for the
[1559.53s -> 1567.72s]  hundred dollars Tingy. But thank you. Hundred bucks came in.
[1567.72s -> 1569.96s]  May sound like a broken record by now but your streams are such an escape
[1569.96s -> 1572.20s]  from reality. For a while I've been struggling with
[1572.20s -> 1575.64s]  anxiety and these past two weeks have been unfortunately hell.
[1575.64s -> 1578.84s]  Currently on antidepressants but I have to be honest your streams are
[1578.84s -> 1581.24s]  the most effective antidepressants there is.
[1581.24s -> 1585.30s]  Even when you're not live it's just a vaude and it's just a vaude.
[1585.30s -> 1587.54s]  I can't donate enough to show you how much I appreciate you and everything
[1587.54s -> 1591.21s]  that you do. I'm really sorry that you're going
[1591.21s -> 1598.54s]  through that shit. Sorry the last couple weeks have not been good
[1598.54s -> 1605.40s]  but you say broken record. No I say this too all the time and I
[1605.40s -> 1608.09s]  mean it. If you enjoy yourself here and this
[1608.09s -> 1610.25s]  can make you feel better and this can make you take you
[1610.25s -> 1614.73s]  a load off then that's great. I'm happy that you're able to have a
[1614.73s -> 1619.19s]  place here where this is fun. So thank you so
[1619.19s -> 1624.57s]  much for the hundred bucks. Let's learn how to fucking drive a
[1624.57s -> 1628.94s]  car. Now this is the uh yeah I got this one.
[1628.94s -> 1633.99s]  Don't don't step in the poison. Okay you can do that at any time to explore an
[1633.99s -> 1638.89s]  object from all sides. By dragging mouse vertically while
[1638.89s -> 1641.85s]  holding you can left and right. Uh wait a minute wait wait wait wait
[1641.85s -> 1644.25s]  wait wait wait wait wait by dragging mouse vertically while holding both
[1644.25s -> 1649.53s]  the mouse buttons you go okay got it. More kid humor today. Okay try to
[1649.53s -> 1655.42s]  zoom and that was a noise right? That was just a noise.
[1655.42s -> 1658.94s]  Stop the kid humor. I can't help it. This is all I've been doing for
[1659.02s -> 1663.27s]  eight days. That's not true. Like the last three or four days were like
[1663.27s -> 1666.47s]  working on this project but like five days before
[1666.47s -> 1671.99s]  that it was all kid humor. This is the same every stream. Is it?
[1671.99s -> 1677.58s]  No it's not. Do I do kid humor on the stream? Okay that's cool.
[1677.58s -> 1680.38s]  Try to zoom out from the earth. Good now we'll learn other basic
[1680.38s -> 1688.97s]  navigation. Uh okay did you spot the moon? I
[1688.97s -> 1705.75s]  did not see the moon. Where is it? There it is. So I press C or the
[1705.75s -> 1712.12s]  blinking and so this is center object. Okay cool. Use it anytime
[1712.12s -> 1714.28s]  when you want to find a selected object that you have lost.
[1714.28s -> 1721.29s]  Try to select any star and center on it. Uh this is the
[1721.29s -> 1726.97s]  y seti. Set no center. And I can just go there too. Now it's
[1726.97s -> 1729.85s]  time to go to the moon. Select the moon and hit the G key
[1729.85s -> 1738.65s]  for go. G. We are flying to the moon
[1738.65s -> 1746.30s]  in real time. Every time I press G I go slow down slow I'm gonna crash
[1746.30s -> 1749.58s]  into it. This is the most useful command in space engine. It's called the go to
[1749.58s -> 1754.68s]  and you'll use it a lot. You may notice that it works only for selected
[1754.68s -> 1757.56s]  objects just like the center command. Okay cool.
[1757.56s -> 1764.94s]  Orbit the moon with the right mouse button and drag until you see the earth.
[1764.94s -> 1770.17s]  Wow look at that. Notice that orbiting as well as zooming
[1770.17s -> 1773.45s]  works relative to the moon. This is because the go to command binds your
[1773.45s -> 1777.45s]  controls to the new object. The moon. The name of the currently
[1777.45s -> 1780.41s]  bound object displayed on the navigation tool with the following moon.
[1781.37s -> 1786.70s]  That's really cool. Sick. You may bind to a different object manually by selecting
[1786.70s -> 1792.39s]  it and pressing shift f. So bind to here is shift f. I'm now
[1792.39s -> 1796.86s]  bound to the earth. Now you may orbit the earth with the
[1796.86s -> 1804.68s]  right drag. Wow. I'm gonna this is gonna be I'll puke
[1804.68s -> 1810.02s]  if I keep doing this. Let's return back to earth. Click the
[1810.02s -> 1813.22s]  blinking icon on the navigation toolbar. It works like a double press of G.
[1813.22s -> 1822.14s]  The fast go to. This is go to object. Nice. Hit
[1822.14s -> 1828.42s]  f2 or click the moon the main menu solar system browser.
[1828.42s -> 1833.16s]  It shows all the stars planets and moons in the current planetary system.
[1833.16s -> 1837.59s]  Left click on a planet to select it. Well we gotta go to jupiter.
[1837.59s -> 1842.94s]  Okay so I have jupiter selected. Somebody's asked can I destroy the
[1842.94s -> 1847.03s]  earth in this game. Not everything has to be about
[1847.03s -> 1854.66s]  destruction and conflict. Okay now I can center that so we're
[1854.66s -> 1861.54s]  centered on jupiter. Try this. Select Venus and go to
[1861.54s -> 1864.10s]  it. So I want to I want to but I want to go to
[1864.10s -> 1875.88s]  jupiter. Venus center on Venus and then go to Venus. This is really
[1875.88s -> 1886.73s]  what it's like. That's not what Venus looks like. This
[1886.73s -> 1894.44s]  is not Venus. That's not what Venus looks like. I know
[1894.44s -> 1902.36s]  what Venus looks like because it's in my chat right now.
[1902.36s -> 1905.72s]  Venus is for some reason in this game
[1905.72s -> 1908.84s]  it's when you get the defect gumball from the gumball machine that
[1908.84s -> 1914.63s]  didn't get any coloring put on it. That's not true. Venus looks like
[1914.95s -> 1920.54s]  it's in the chat. Okay you can navigate the solar system browser like folders in
[1920.54s -> 1922.70s]  your computer. Double click on any planet which has
[1922.70s -> 1934.63s]  moons. What? Does Venus not have a moon?
[1934.63s -> 1941.11s]  What? Yeah doesn't. Okay you can also click the satellites icon which
[1941.11s -> 1945.64s]  appears on the planet's cell when you hover a mouse over it.
[1945.64s -> 1950.90s]  Satellites. Oh wait what about jupiter? Oh isn't it? Okay I
[1950.90s -> 1954.71s]  I'm not even looking at the screen. I know the jupiter moons. It's
[1955.61s -> 1967.27s]  Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, and Yo right? Yep I got it. You've entered this list of
[1967.27s -> 1970.87s]  satellites. You can select any by left clicking to go back double click on the
[1970.87s -> 1975.56s]  parent object. That's so cool. All right let's like
[1975.56s -> 1983.26s]  center on that. It's easy. Now select Yo the moon of
[1983.26s -> 1986.46s]  Jupiter. Double click on Jupiter enter its moons and left click on
[1986.46s -> 1992.28s]  Yo. Now that the select is pointing to now fly there using the go to
[1992.36s -> 2010.78s]  command. We're going to Yo. Here it comes. Whoa what?
[2010.78s -> 2014.54s]  Nice close the solar system browser by hitting F2 or prison the eye. Yeah F2
[2014.54s -> 2017.66s]  you can close the solar system browser. Let's go to Saturn. You can find it by
[2017.66s -> 2024.30s]  using the solar system browser or by the search tool.
[2024.30s -> 2029.19s]  Saturn. There it is center. Just take a look where it is.
[2029.19s -> 2035.18s]  Go to Saturn. By the way you think this is the the whole game?
[2035.18s -> 2040.54s]  I've got an extreme news for you. No you can land on any planet you
[2040.54s -> 2043.34s]  want and explore it. This is not just like look at the
[2043.34s -> 2049.48s]  planet simulator. Any of these planets can be it's like
[2049.48s -> 2052.81s]  what's that game? Once again that guy was on all the late
[2052.81s -> 2055.77s]  night tv shows talking about how it was like the greatest thing ever
[2055.77s -> 2058.89s]  and it wasn't the greatest thing ever at all and then like three years
[2058.89s -> 2069.62s]  later they like made it really good. No man's sky that's what it is okay.
[2069.62s -> 2074.44s]  Show us your house. I've got to learn how to play.
[2074.44s -> 2080.74s]  All right I'm on Saturn. Click the lens icon. Yeah it wants me to
[2080.74s -> 2087.64s]  search. Parents, son, asteroid. All right hold on.
[2087.64s -> 2096.34s]  Damn it. Nobody named a star after me? All right dude how many of these
[2096.34s -> 2112.66s]  are actually oh is it like a you have to think there's gonna be
[2112.66s -> 2126.09s]  because they had that like star registry thing.
[2126.09s -> 2129.69s]  Big Bits just came in right now. Big Bits, Big Bits, Big Bits. I got it. I
[2129.69s -> 2134.98s]  got it. I got it. The Diabeetles just gave 100 bucks. 200
[2134.98s -> 2137.22s]  dollars back to back here. Thanks guys.
[2137.22s -> 2142.26s]  Thank you Diabeetles for the 100 bucks and they say hey Jerma things have been
[2142.26s -> 2145.14s]  pretty rough lately. I recently separated from my fiance and
[2145.14s -> 2147.46s]  it just seems like things were getting worse from there.
[2147.46s -> 2150.87s]  I'm fucking sorry to hear that but even at my lowest I could go back to
[2150.87s -> 2153.51s]  your videos or watch your streams and you've always given me a reason to
[2153.51s -> 2156.57s]  laugh. Going back to therapy and I'm making
[2156.57s -> 2159.22s]  changes to make my life better. Just wanted to thank you. I've been
[2159.22s -> 2163.59s]  watching since 2012 and I always could come to you for a
[2163.59s -> 2169.50s]  laugh. I'm happy that you're taking some necessary steps here to
[2169.50s -> 2174.82s]  take care of yourself. Making some changes. Going to therapy.
[2174.82s -> 2179.13s]  I wish you the best of luck. I'm really sorry to fucking hear that. That's
[2179.13s -> 2183.37s]  that sucks. But keep your head up because
[2183.37s -> 2190.84s]  I'm not sure how old you are but I really do truly wish you the best
[2190.84s -> 2196.23s]  because that's tough. Thanks for sticking around. Thanks for watching the
[2196.23s -> 2211.08s]  videos and the streams for that long. Glad you have a good time.
[2211.08s -> 2213.88s]  Look at all these. Look at all these Jerma hearts in the chat. That
[2213.88s -> 2218.34s]  makes me feel good. It does. All right. How about just
[2218.34s -> 2224.09s]  like John? Yeah. Johnson. This is absolutely
[2224.09s -> 2229.80s]  somebody's star registry name. How about like I don't know somebody has to have
[2229.80s -> 2235.29s]  some like like I don't know like Gandalf right?
[2235.29s -> 2243.08s]  No. I don't know like Da Vinci? Did like did Leonardo Da Vinci have a
[2243.08s -> 2253.35s]  star named after him? No. Was that just a scam? I don't think
[2253.35s -> 2261.21s]  it even did anything. All right well we have to find Saturn.
[2261.21s -> 2266.14s]  There it is. Saturn 1. Saturn 2. Saturn 3.
[2266.14s -> 2274.12s]  Saturn 4. Saturn 9. Saturn L.
[2274.12s -> 2279.45s]  What does that mean? Saturn L3? How many Saturns are there?
[2279.45s -> 2290.87s]  Okay let's go to Saturn. Saturn. No Saturn.
[2290.87s -> 2296.86s]  I'm gonna click okay. Perfect. To consolidate the knowledge go to Mars.
[2296.86s -> 2301.72s]  Find it using the solar system browser. Yeah we can just go Mars.
[2301.72s -> 2305.24s]  There it is. Hey how many Marses are there?
[2305.24s -> 2319.18s]  Oh yeah I want to go. Go to. There it is. That's not even what Mars looks like.
[2319.18s -> 2324.58s]  Somebody put Mars here please. Actually yeah it is. All right now we're gonna
[2324.58s -> 2334.55s]  learn how to fly. We're almost done. All right I'm not
[2334.55s -> 2337.51s]  gonna make any more jokes. I'm just gonna blow through the
[2337.51s -> 2341.21s]  tutorial so just put on like your favorite song
[2341.21s -> 2352.17s]  and I mean I recommend. I don't know. Put on like church music or something. Who cares?
[2352.17s -> 2355.13s]  All right I'm gonna go. Just don't pay attention to me anymore.
[2355.13s -> 2357.13s]  I'm just gonna do the tutorial and we're gonna go.
[2357.21s -> 2361.40s]  Advanced movement control space. Basic controls. Yeah yeah moving around like this and that.
[2361.40s -> 2365.38s]  Clicking outside the solar system. Okay find the planet.
[2365.38s -> 2369.96s]  Go find the planet Trappist. Okay let's get that open.
[2369.96s -> 2381.30s]  Trappist. Trappist 1G. F E F G. Okay then let's get out. Let's get
[2381.30s -> 2394.02s]  over there. Go to. Oh this is cool. Wait what? Did I go too fast?
[2394.02s -> 2402.76s]  Oh boy. Alien ice icy planet almost 40 light years away from Earth.
[2402.76s -> 2406.36s]  Now we will learn the free movement. The go-to command allows you to quickly
[2406.36s -> 2409.16s]  reach the desired object but exploring it is much more
[2409.16s -> 2412.84s]  enjoyable using a game like free movement. Press the W key.
[2412.84s -> 2416.36s]  Press the W key. It's the funnest word to say in broadcasting.
[2416.36s -> 2420.28s]  Once you learn how to say W it becomes so much fun for you to do.
[2420.28s -> 2426.04s]  W W W W W W W W W W W. It's so. Once you go to
[2426.04s -> 2428.20s]  broadcasting school you'll learn it. It's fun.
[2428.20s -> 2436.14s]  You did this joke before. No I didn't. No I didn't. No I didn't.
[2436.14s -> 2441.67s]  All right I gotta fucking calm down. You may move in multiple directions.
[2441.67s -> 2452.41s]  R and F is up and down. Okay cool. A D W S R F.
[2452.41s -> 2456.07s]  Yep. W and then S to fly forward and backward. Yep.
[2456.07s -> 2460.98s]  A and D left and right. Yep. R and F to go
[2460.98s -> 2465.46s]  rup and then found. You may change the flight direction with the mouse.
[2465.54s -> 2472.26s]  Press W to fly forward and then. Remember these two key keys. Q and E.
[2472.26s -> 2485.03s]  They change your roll. Whoa. All right. What kid joke.
[2485.03s -> 2491.78s]  Now try to reach the waypoint. Come on like Superman 64.
[2491.78s -> 2496.10s]  Adjust your velocity with the mouse wheel with the plus and minus keys.
[2496.10s -> 2499.59s]  Now depending on how funny you are this stream you will go faster or
[2499.59s -> 2501.67s]  slower. Scroll the wheel up. Press the
[2501.67s -> 2506.92s]  plus key to increase to 1000 kilometers a second. Perfect. Now you
[2506.92s -> 2509.24s]  can reach the waypoint quicker. This is another indicator that shows your
[2509.24s -> 2513.78s]  current velocity. It is zero while standing and equal to
[2513.78s -> 2516.34s]  the assigned velocity while moving. Reach the waypoint.
[2516.34s -> 2524.92s]  Okay. Good. Proceed to the next waypoint. The selection pointer will help you
[2524.92s -> 2531.43s]  locate it. Try this. Whoa. Slowly descend on the
[2531.43s -> 2540.78s]  planet surface. This is Superman 64 and then we're
[2540.78s -> 2549.06s]  going to land on the planet. Remember Q R E. Two waypoints left.
[2549.14s -> 2553.34s]  This is the surface of the universe. One less
[2553.34s -> 2562.66s]  surface. Here it is. Look at this shit. Are they aliens?
[2562.66s -> 2566.25s]  All right. I made it. We are on the surface now. Note
[2566.25s -> 2569.13s]  that if you hit the ground your velocity will be flat.
[2569.13s -> 2577.19s]  Fly to the green waypoint ahead and explore the terrain. Explore the
[2577.19s -> 2580.47s]  planet. Depending on your computer speed
[2580.47s -> 2590.86s]  terrain may take a while to load. I got a pretty fast computer speed.
[2590.86s -> 2595.45s]  Cool. Free flight is easy isn't it? Now let's return to space. Just fly
[2595.45s -> 2599.21s]  into the sky away from the planet or use the R key to fly straight up.
[2599.21s -> 2602.09s]  Increase your speed to 100 to 200 kilometers a second with the mouse
[2602.09s -> 2624.04s]  wheel to do that faster. Whoa. I'll never dig straight up.
[2624.04s -> 2628.60s]  That's pretty cool. Great. We're in space again. You also may use the go
[2628.60s -> 2633.08s]  to command to fly to a default distance from the planet.
[2633.08s -> 2639.99s]  Go to object. Ah okay. You can land on a planet automatically
[2640.79s -> 2651.98s]  shift G on any planet to do that. How fast? But that's fast. Wow. Another
[2651.98s -> 2654.62s]  way to land on a planet or exit to space is using the zoom.
[2654.62s -> 2658.86s]  Hold both the left and right buttons and drag the mouse vertically.
[2658.86s -> 2661.10s]  Note that this works with the current bound object.
[2661.10s -> 2675.69s]  Oh interesting. Yep. It works. Okay. Now you know the basics of the free
[2675.69s -> 2678.49s]  flight in space engine. You can explore anything with it. Not only
[2678.49s -> 2682.65s]  planets. Simply increase your velocity to some unimaginable value and fly to
[2682.65s -> 2695.06s]  interstellar space. Not yet. Not yet. Okay. Let's just get back out.
[2695.06s -> 2705.21s]  So is that it? Do I now know how to play? All right. Let's go.
[2705.21s -> 2720.54s]  Where should I go? Where am I? Whoa. 10. Set the velocity of 10 light years
[2720.54s -> 2727.13s]  a second. That's too fast. C's? How many C's?
[2727.13s -> 2731.13s]  What's the C mean? A U is a second. That's a that is
[2731.45s -> 2735.96s]  you go over the course of Australia in a second. That's how much terrain that is.
[2735.96s -> 2743.42s]  This is a thousand Australias a second. One. Okay. Now one light year a second.
[2743.42s -> 2748.18s]  10 light years a second. Is this gonna hurt? I feel like this is gonna be
[2748.18s -> 2759.34s]  scary. You may approach any star and enter its planetary system.
[2759.34s -> 2762.70s]  Fly to Betelgeuse. It is highlighted with the selection pointer. Aim the
[2762.70s -> 2775.67s]  camera towards it and press W to fly forward. Heading towards Betelgeuse.
[2775.67s -> 2782.31s]  Now that's the third time? No. It's okay. It's okay.
[2782.31s -> 2804.71s]  Betelgeuse is dead. So it's okay. I didn't have I didn't have it cued up.
[2804.71s -> 2807.83s]  But he's like a demon. He's gone. He was like purged
[2807.83s -> 2818.06s]  fucking a million years ago. Okay. Hold on.
[2818.06s -> 2828.52s]  Slow down. What is this? Hey no. Too fast.
[2828.52s -> 2832.04s]  Get over there. 778 Australias a second. That sounds good.
[2832.04s -> 2840.60s]  Center on you. You're now entering the planetary system. Small dots near
[2840.60s -> 2845.14s]  the star are its planets. Approach the star so you can see its
[2845.14s -> 2852.41s]  surface. Oh. Oh it's gold. It means gold. AU is gold. It's gold.
[2852.41s -> 2862.74s]  That's what it is. Wow. That was fun. Okay this is Betelgeuse.
[2862.74s -> 2867.35s]  One of the brightest stars in the constellation of Orion.
[2867.35s -> 2870.71s]  A red supergiant. It looks lumpy because of very weak gravity on its
[2870.71s -> 2877.00s]  surface which is barely maintaining the gas in its place.
[2877.00s -> 2880.04s]  Now look at the filters toolbar. Click the blinking icon to show orbital
[2880.04s -> 2884.26s]  paths of planets. Oh that's cool. You can see like
[2884.34s -> 2898.57s]  where the rotations are for oops. Where did I go? Shit.
[2898.57s -> 2907.00s]  Where? Hold on. Where was it? Oh shit it's it's it's lost in the crumbs.
[2907.00s -> 2932.50s]  Oh fuck. Hold on. There it is. Oh okay now I'm orbiting this. I get it.
[2932.50s -> 2937.48s]  Okay all right. Orbits of planets will help you with
[2937.48s -> 2940.44s]  visual navigation in the planetary system. Planets are shining dots at the
[2940.44s -> 2943.40s]  bright ends of lines. Try to reach any planet. Oh I didn't
[2943.40s -> 2946.47s]  turn color. Now try to reach any planet manually
[2946.87s -> 2954.41s]  What's going on? What's going on? What's happening? What?
[2954.41s -> 2961.69s]  Okay I have to slow down. So I need to fly into a planet that's orbiting.
[2961.69s -> 2967.70s]  Let's go down here. There it is. We got to go faster than
[2967.70s -> 2981.08s]  this. 285 Celsius. Right here. This one. What is this one?
[2981.08s -> 2987.29s]  Betelgeuse 2. Let's fly to it. This one looks cool. Wait a minute. Hold on.
[2987.29s -> 2993.00s]  There's more in here? Betelgeuse 2 has its own life system.
[2993.00s -> 2998.55s]  Its own solar system. Orbits of planets.
[2998.55s -> 3000.95s]  Perfect. Now that you know how to explore the universe in free flight mode, next
[3000.95s -> 3006.01s]  tutorial will teach you how to manipulate time flow.
[3006.01s -> 3013.37s]  Wait a minute. Where'd I just go? I just like sucked into it.
[3013.37s -> 3031.22s]  Shit. Get up. Up. Go up. Okay I want to turn off like the gas.
[3031.22s -> 3039.82s]  I'm on the surface. Whoa no I'm not. Holy shit.
[3039.82s -> 3044.86s]  All right I'm out. Okay now we can do time.
[3044.86s -> 3054.76s]  Look we're getting close. There it is. All right.
[3054.76s -> 3059.08s]  The navigation toolbar has all the options for time control. Some of which
[3059.08s -> 3062.60s]  have their own hotkey. The blinking element is the date bar.
[3062.60s -> 3066.36s]  It displays the current simulation date and time. I can't wait to see what
[3066.36s -> 3070.12s]  Las Vegas looks like when it was like two million years ago.
[3070.12s -> 3074.36s]  It may differ from the real date because in space engine you're free
[3074.36s -> 3083.18s]  in space and time. Cool. Right. Whatever. The buttons below the
[3083.18s -> 3088.78s]  date bar control time flow. You can speed up and slow down the
[3088.78s -> 3092.54s]  time, reverse it, and reset it to the current date based on the system
[3092.54s -> 3099.91s]  clock. Speed up the time to see space bodies in movement. Press the L key
[3099.91s -> 3110.42s]  to speed up the flow to times 10. Selection pointer. Disabled. What?
[3110.42s -> 3113.70s]  Planet Shine. Disabled. What? What are you talking about? L key.
[3113.70s -> 3125.58s]  Am I missing something here? Press the L key or this button
[3125.58s -> 3143.72s]  twice. What's going on here? Did I mess something up?
[3143.72s -> 3157.82s]  Shift L. Planet Shine. L. Something's going on here.
[3157.82s -> 3160.78s]  Now sometimes the game bugs regarding time. Might have to reset it. Hold on.
[3160.78s -> 3165.94s]  Let's try this. Oh there we go. Times 10. I lost my
[3165.94s -> 3172.92s]  tutorial though. This is just times 10 speed but I don't
[3172.92s -> 3183.66s]  have my tutorial anymore. I'm lost. Times 100 speed. Times a
[3183.66s -> 3188.90s]  thousand. Times 10,000. Times 30,000. Times 5
[3188.90s -> 3192.82s]  million. At some point this is going to turn into
[3192.82s -> 3198.28s]  like a pottery. It's going to be... Is it burning up on the top?
[3198.28s -> 3216.76s]  Stop. Set normal time speed. Okay. I want to get off the ride.
[3216.76s -> 3224.81s]  All right. I think I need to see if we can get that back. Okay.
[3224.81s -> 3228.25s]  Date and time. Yeah. We can do... We can reverse it.
[3228.25s -> 3231.13s]  Times 10 speed. There we go. I'll get it. Times 10.
[3231.13s -> 3236.50s]  Continue increasing the time till you get to 3,000.
[3236.50s -> 3244.92s]  3,000. Okay. Now press the O key to see the orbits.
[3244.92s -> 3249.38s]  You can put on labels. What is that? What does it want me to do?
[3249.38s -> 3255.16s]  Oh. You can observe the orbit of motion of the
[3255.16s -> 3260.68s]  Galilean moons. O, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. To make it more
[3260.68s -> 3265.24s]  convenient zoom out from Jupiter to 5 million kilometers left plus right
[3265.24s -> 3272.58s]  and drag to see now the whole thing. So the
[3272.58s -> 3275.78s]  moon's orbits will be seen from the top. Look at the Jupiter info table
[3275.78s -> 3282.42s]  for the distance readout. This is cool. Look at how educational
[3282.42s -> 3286.82s]  this is. Imagine if you were... Who's sniping Jupiter right now?
[3286.82s -> 3296.65s]  Is there something... Is that bad? Okay. Jupiter info table.
[3299.27s -> 3311.10s]  The distance readout. Distance readout. What is the orbit here?
[3311.10s -> 3315.67s]  Should I have gone out further? 5 million kilometers.
[3315.67s -> 3323.62s]  I mean this is 5 million kilometers. Right here is 5 million.
[3323.62s -> 3332.23s]  And orbit to its northern pole. I was already there. Now accelerate
[3332.23s -> 3346.02s]  time by times 30,000. Oops. Back. This is insane.
[3346.02s -> 3348.34s]  Now we will learn all the buttons which it controls the speed of time.
[3348.34s -> 3354.14s]  Press the space bar to pause the simulation.
[3354.14s -> 3366.31s]  Again, to resume. Kids jokes are costing him this time.
[3366.31s -> 3371.02s]  It's all right. It's all right. These kids jokes really. They do very, very
[3371.02s -> 3374.95s]  well. These kids jokes do very, very well
[3374.95s -> 3378.23s]  during a paused bathroom break of Zootopia. So
[3378.23s -> 3383.66s]  I mean come on. All right. Jakey reverses the time
[3383.66s -> 3392.44s]  flow. So we're now going in reverse. Reverse time.
[3392.44s -> 3400.34s]  That's ridiculous. Note that the simulation date and time displayed in
[3400.34s -> 3408.52s]  the date bar are counting backwards. It's 2016 already.
[3408.52s -> 3414.31s]  Restore the normal direction. Accelerate time to 3000
[3414.31s -> 3421.14s]  by pressing the K key several times. You can put it back to real time
[3421.14s -> 3426.34s]  like this. Control slash sets the simulation time
[3426.34s -> 3432.04s]  to the current system time. I'll just press it. Okay.
[3432.04s -> 3435.16s]  Great. We have now learned time speed controls. Remember the reverse
[3435.16s -> 3438.60s]  decelerate, accelerate, set normal, set current. Got it.
[3438.60s -> 3441.40s]  You can easily change the simulation date time by clicking the date bar and
[3441.40s -> 3455.83s]  typing the desired date. Okay. 2016, period 11,
[3455.83s -> 3464.74s]  period 15, 21. Okay. And then hour and minute. Or that's
[3464.74s -> 3471.78s]  just fine. And then hit enter. Whoa. Now we will
[3471.78s -> 3475.46s]  use your knowledge to catch up to the solar eclipse on Europa. Look at
[3475.46s -> 3485.29s]  Europa and accelerate up to 10,000. Pause time with the
[3485.29s -> 3491.83s]  space bar when Europa enters the shadow. What shadow? Like over here?
[3491.83s -> 3500.50s]  Yeah, like right here. Now slowly accelerate the time
[3500.50s -> 3509.18s]  until Europa starts moving. 1000 times is a good value. Once Europa exits
[3509.18s -> 3521.48s]  the shadow, reverse the time flow. The moon will start moving back. Wait
[3521.48s -> 3524.68s]  until Europa enters the shadow and exits from the opposite side. Then
[3524.68s -> 3545.67s]  decrease the speed to minus 100. Almost. Restore the normal time
[3545.67s -> 3551.86s]  flow by pressing J. When Europa enters the shadow again, set the time speed to
[3551.86s -> 3556.98s]  real time. What? Can I just see it? Can I just like
[3556.98s -> 3577.26s]  look at it? Now go to Europa. Europa. Wow, it's
[3577.26s -> 3580.06s]  completely black. Reverse the time flow and accelerate it a bit until
[3580.06s -> 3599.74s]  Europa exits the shadow. Reverse time flow. And accelerate. No!
[3599.74s -> 3607.40s]  Go back. Can I go back? No, no, no. Other way. Other way. Reverse the
[3607.40s -> 3614.15s]  flow. Now land to this green point and
[3614.15s -> 3620.17s]  watch the sun getting eclipsed by Jupiter. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3620.17s -> 3623.78s]  Wait, stop. Pause it right there. This is as good as it. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[3623.78s -> 3679.13s]  Stop time. Oh, whoa. Oh, cool. Here we go.
[3679.13s -> 3688.22s]  Wow. The next tutorial. Guys, I know what we're going to do.
[3688.22s -> 3694.47s]  I need people to find events that happen to the solar system.
[3694.47s -> 3698.07s]  You know what I mean? When did like an asteroid like explode?
[3698.07s -> 3701.67s]  We have to go find the exact day and time of where it was and go
[3701.67s -> 3706.98s]  watch it. All right. The next tutorial will
[3706.98s -> 3714.97s]  teach you how to use the telescope. We're getting there. Well, we're done.
[3714.97s -> 3728.65s]  This is like photo modes. Did you notice the thin lines near Jupiter's
[3728.65s -> 3733.74s]  crescent? These are its very faint dusty rings
[3733.74s -> 3737.54s]  that are only visible under certain lighting conditions. You may make them
[3737.54s -> 3740.42s]  more visible by switching space engine to the realistic photographic mode.
[3740.42s -> 3747.53s]  Press the V key. Oh, okay. This is the auto exposure
[3747.53s -> 3751.21s]  mode. In this mode space engine renders celestial objects with
[3751.21s -> 3754.17s]  physical accurate brightness in attempts to adjust
[3754.17s -> 3756.97s]  camera sensitivity or exposure automatically. When you look at a dark
[3756.97s -> 3759.93s]  sky it sets it to a human eye sensitivity.
[3759.93s -> 3764.47s]  Who cares? You know what I mean? Exposure one.
[3764.47s -> 3772.25s]  We'll just display it as exposure one. Yeah, I mean we can make this look cool.
[3772.25s -> 3777.06s]  We can take photos. We can zoom in. Yeah, I get it.
[3777.06s -> 3788.02s]  I get it. I do. You know what I mean? I get it.
[3788.02s -> 3803.51s]  All right, we got it. I don't think the camera mode is something that's
[3803.51s -> 3806.52s]  interesting. We can do... I know how to work it.
[3806.52s -> 3811.64s]  Photo camera. We got... Notice the value of the exposure display.
[3811.64s -> 3817.02s]  Roughly corresponds to the photo camera shutter speed. Oh yeah, something's wrong
[3817.02s -> 3829.70s]  here. There we go. Press and hold this, this
[3829.70s -> 3836.25s]  to change the exposure value. Yep. You can make it look really, really
[3836.25s -> 3842.84s]  blown up and nice and cool. Yeah, this is cool.
[3842.84s -> 3847.80s]  All right, I'm ready. I don't think there's anything else I need to do.
[3847.80s -> 3851.69s]  Universe map maybe. I kind of want to just browse around for a little
[3851.69s -> 3855.02s]  bit. You know what I mean? I'm just going
[3855.02s -> 3863.40s]  to go. I want to browse around. So this is
[3863.40s -> 3866.44s]  where we are. Where are we? We're at the cold,
[3866.44s -> 3880.78s]  airless... Turn up object quality. Where would that be? Visual style?
[3880.78s -> 3896.78s]  Lens flare? We'll look at object quality. Filter objects? No, we got
[3896.78s -> 3915.85s]  that. That looks good. Graphics? Go to custom.
[3915.85s -> 3927.35s]  I'm scared. Should I do... I mean black hole... I feel like this is going to
[3927.35s -> 3931.80s]  break my computer. Max the shit out? I can't do that. My
[3931.80s -> 3937.21s]  computer's not good enough. I don't got AMD. Maximum graphics. I'm
[3937.21s -> 3947.40s]  not going to be able to stream this. High. I'm keeping it on high. No, this is
[3947.40s -> 3950.79s]  all right. All right, let's just go. So I want to...
[3950.79s -> 3954.46s]  Where's earth? I want to first see how detailed this is.
[3954.46s -> 3962.38s]  Where's earth? And where's my search? There it is. Okay,
[3962.38s -> 3969.83s]  earth. Right there. Go to earth. Is that the sun?
[3969.83s -> 3973.75s]  There we go. All right, so I want to do the current date.
[3973.75s -> 3976.87s]  This is what it looks like right now outside your house. Outside your
[3976.87s -> 3980.81s]  window when you look. This is what it looks like. Well,
[3980.81s -> 3984.07s]  you know what I mean? Like when you're looking down... When you're looking down
[3984.07s -> 3986.07s]  out your window if you're in a spacecraft above the earth. This is
[3986.07s -> 3996.66s]  what it looked like. So let's go to the United States.
[3996.66s -> 4008.38s]  Australia. There's... Is that Africa? No, that's South America. I mean,
[4008.38s -> 4012.39s]  that's Brazil. I know what it is. God. Give me a
[4012.39s -> 4015.19s]  break guys. You think I'm crazy? All right, let's... I want to make it so
[4015.19s -> 4023.90s]  we're like in the... Let's spin it around. I need some light. I want the
[4023.90s -> 4030.90s]  sun. I don't want it to be dark. Come to Brazil. I will. I'll go to
[4030.90s -> 4042.50s]  Brazil. So we're gonna go see. Okay, maybe a little bit more. Okay,
[4042.50s -> 4047.94s]  that looks good. I need to set this as like the object in
[4047.94s -> 4054.46s]  rotating the earth. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[4054.46s -> 4069.11s]  Oh, shit! I used one of my wishes. Hold on. Should I try to find Las Vegas
[4069.11s -> 4074.87s]  from here? All right, I'm gonna try to. Let's
[4074.87s -> 4078.71s]  see if I can find my house from the middle of the ocean.
[4078.71s -> 4087.54s]  There's no way I'm gonna fucking do this. It's ocean in every direction.
[4087.54s -> 4091.74s]  This is 200 miles per hour. I'm essentially a plane.
[4091.74s -> 4101.35s]  But hide everything. I don't want any tips. I'm a plane right now.
[4101.35s -> 4116.58s]  All right, hold on. The sun... The sun sets in the east and rises in the
[4116.58s -> 4120.25s]  west. No, the sun sets and rises in the east,
[4120.25s -> 4129.99s]  sets in the west. This is the right way. The home of the rising sun
[4129.99s -> 4148.79s]  is east. You can just fly a plane. I'm in the plane right now. Can I do
[4148.79s -> 4163.85s]  a different view? Do planes go 2,000 miles per hour?
[4163.93s -> 4174.46s]  I don't think planes go fucking 5,000 miles per hour.
[4174.46s -> 4192.92s]  No, they don't. They go like 600. Ooh. Acceleration. All right, I need to
[4192.92s -> 4204.17s]  find land. Left toolbar for vehicles.
[4204.17s -> 4227.16s]  Spacecraft manager? Drunk superman. It's actually kind of
[4227.16s -> 4232.33s]  fun to control this because it's really delayed. I just
[4232.33s -> 4248.09s]  need to get to land. I think I see land. The sun is
[4248.09s -> 4254.68s]  setting in my face. Good luck finding anything. I think I can see land right
[4254.68s -> 4260.22s]  here. Is this California? All right, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[4260.22s -> 4263.02s]  Wait, no, that's not California. Where's California? I gotta find
[4263.02s -> 4275.99s]  California. I'm going so fast. I would have already crossed land by
[4275.99s -> 4287.32s]  now, wouldn't I? I'm going east? Wait, did the sun just
[4287.32s -> 4299.42s]  rise? Is this rising or is the sun setting? What day is it?
[4299.42s -> 4303.18s]  It's setting. All right, so that's fine. Should I put time up a little just
[4303.18s -> 4310.65s]  to make sure? Hold on. I'm gonna increase time. Is
[4310.65s -> 4318.82s]  that going down? That shit's going up. That's going up. I'm going the
[4318.82s -> 4337.46s]  wrong way. Hold on, folks. Am I just in the Pacific
[4337.46s -> 4346.06s]  Ocean? Can I see what ocean this is? I'm sorry. I'm trying to get to
[4346.06s -> 4349.75s]  Vegas. I went a different route this time.
[4349.75s -> 4357.06s]  I decided to go across the whole Pacific Ocean twice.
[4357.06s -> 4366.12s]  Normal time. Normal time. Time scale. Use the balloon option. There is no
[4366.12s -> 4382.68s]  balloon. Should I swim? What's going on?
[4383.08s -> 4387.08s]  Okay, get me in the normal...
[4387.08s -> 4392.42s]  Okay. No, that's too fast. How fast can you swim?
[4392.42s -> 4396.74s]  I could probably go like, I don't know, 15 miles per hour? 20 miles per hour
[4396.74s -> 4410.07s]  swimming? All right, where am I? Can I see like
[4410.07s -> 4415.16s]  longitude, latitude? All right, I'm in 35. No, that's time.
[4415.16s -> 4420.73s]  Where's longitude, latitude? I need info. I can't even use
[4420.73s -> 4428.94s]  wiki. Where's the sun? I have to stare at the sun for a second.
[4429.02s -> 4438.71s]  I need to know how... I need... Where's it going? We gotta go that way.
[4438.71s -> 4443.26s]  The sun rises in the east, sets in the west. We gotta go... What's going on?
[4443.26s -> 4450.73s]  Oh, we gotta go that way. All right, stop.
[4450.73s -> 4458.33s]  Okay, normal time scale. Let's go. All right, just imagine that I was in like
[4458.33s -> 4459.77s]  a... I don't know, like a sailboat. They
[4459.77s -> 4471.06s]  go how fast? Like 60? Okay, now we're in the plane again. Here we go. Let's
[4471.06s -> 4475.67s]  go. I'm gonna go faster. This is going
[4475.67s -> 4479.99s]  to take you days. No, if you go 2,000 miles per hour,
[4479.99s -> 4486.36s]  it's not gonna do that. I'm going so fast right now, like
[4486.36s -> 4490.65s]  I'm just gonna get across the ocean. This is 20 fucking thousand, 50,000 miles
[4490.65s -> 4507.24s]  per hour. Where's the sun? There it is. 100,000 miles per hour.
[4507.24s -> 4514.98s]  Where the fuck is land? I'm almost going a million miles per
[4514.98s -> 4549.85s]  hour. Where is land? What the fuck is going on? Is there
[4549.85s -> 4557.82s]  no land on earth? I'm going 5 million miles per hour.
[4557.82s -> 4561.40s]  Then the oceans are not this big. Wait, wait!
[4561.40s -> 4582.76s]  Those clouds? Earth is 75% water. What is that? What's this? What is
[4582.76s -> 4595.59s]  this? Found it. But what land? Planet Earth. What continent is
[4595.59s -> 4616.71s]  this? I made it. My computer's not good enough
[4616.71s -> 4628.02s]  though. All right, let me see. Let me guess where I am.
[4628.02s -> 4631.62s]  Yes, I know. I'm aware that this looks like a Minecraft skin. I know.
[4631.62s -> 4643.50s]  This is a Minecraft seed. I think, I think I'm in
[4643.50s -> 4685.67s]  China. China. I don't know where, where am I?
[4685.67s -> 4690.54s]  I was right! I was right! It was pretty close.
[4690.54s -> 4701.50s]  I was pretty close. Okay, now I just have to go to Vegas without
[4701.50s -> 4714.28s]  guessing. That's Russia? No, it's not. It's China. Okay, here we go.
[4714.28s -> 4740.71s]  Let's go to Las Vegas. There ain't nothing here. There's nothing here.
[4740.71s -> 4750.50s]  Oh shit. Oh well. It's just the same bitmap image. I wonder, can I like
[4750.50s -> 4753.38s]  actually search for Vegas? I don't think they would have like that
[4753.38s -> 4757.99s]  kind of shit on here. Why would they have that on here?
[4757.99s -> 4769.98s]  Vegas. All right, let's see if I can find... Whoa, easy.
[4769.98s -> 4776.25s]  All right, can I... I mean this is like the desert connecting California
[4776.25s -> 4786.58s]  to Vegas. Are there any cities? Why would there
[4786.58s -> 4792.87s]  be cities? This is a space exploration game. Why
[4792.87s -> 4795.59s]  do I care about if there are cities or not?
[4795.59s -> 4802.95s]  We can go anywhere in the world. We would just be doing Google Earth. Yeah.
[4802.95s -> 4813.08s]  Why would I be doing this? I'm only exploring
[4813.08s -> 4818.49s]  Earth. Oh yeah, I have to explore the universe. All right.
[4818.49s -> 4825.80s]  What's that? The Andromeda. But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to see
[4825.80s -> 4829.80s]  something. Hold on. Let's do a once and for all. Once
[4829.80s -> 4835.94s]  and for all. Let's see if it's true. So according... I want to see if Pangea
[4835.94s -> 4846.74s]  exists. You know what I'm saying? Let's see if it's real. Okay, so we're
[4846.74s -> 4855.14s]  gonna go back here. We're gonna reverse time. We're gonna
[4855.14s -> 4860.54s]  go back to... How many years?
[4860.54s -> 4875.18s]  How many years was Pangea? It's like one?
[4875.18s -> 4887.35s]  One. One, one. Yeah, one, one, one. Just one. Let's see what it looks
[4887.35s -> 4889.40s]  like. And then we'll do it like, I don't know,
[4889.40s -> 4906.33s]  two o'clock. All right, so what we got here?
[4906.33s -> 4919.66s]  Ah, fucking Pangea debunked. Why are there
[4919.66s -> 4925.75s]  lights? Why are there so much city lights? Okay, so
[4925.75s -> 4944.30s]  one ad. Can I do negative time? This is minus ten thousand. Oh, hold on.
[4944.30s -> 4968.73s]  There's hundreds of millions. That's not enough. There's no rotation on the
[4968.73s -> 4988.26s]  Earth. Why? No, still not connected. The
[4988.26s -> 5007.37s]  Earth hasn't spun yet. Oh, there we go. Okay. No, it looks
[5007.37s -> 5010.49s]  pretty normal to me. Sorry, guys. All right, give me an event.
[5010.49s -> 5016.20s]  How about a comet? What's like a cool comet?
[5016.20s -> 5021.16s]  What's a comet that's gone through? Somebody just dumped coordinates into the
[5021.16s -> 5028.02s]  chat. And oh yeah, the Andromeda. I want to
[5028.02s -> 5034.86s]  check out the Andromeda. Andromeda. It's a galaxy. Let's go to it.
[5034.86s -> 5045.00s]  Normal time. Look at this place. All right, let's get it. So there's...
[5045.00s -> 5048.60s]  Let's get in the galaxy. Now, what's in here? What's this?
[5048.60s -> 5057.66s]  M-110. Oh, fuck. I'm still in 10 minus 10 million BC.
[5057.66s -> 5061.74s]  Current time. There we go. And we're on
[5061.74s -> 5066.10s]  times one scale. That's fine. You guys ready?
[5067.96s -> 5079.48s]  I'm flying at insane speeds. What's in here?
[5079.48s -> 5089.80s]  Go right into the center. Hold on, wait. The Andromeda is gonna collide.
[5089.80s -> 5099.22s]  Whoa, hold on. Slow down a little. Who the fuck are you?
[5099.22s -> 5109.30s]  RS-1235. Let's get some more info on you, please.
[5109.30s -> 5123.03s]  This is the one. Found it. Watch the collision. Let's get in there.
[5123.03s -> 5129.37s]  All right, let's take a look. White luminous supergiant.
[5129.37s -> 5132.97s]  Go find a black hole. I'm gonna try, but let me... I want to get onto this
[5132.97s -> 5138.54s]  planet. I want to see what it's like on here.
[5138.54s -> 5143.06s]  Increase the mag limit. What does that do?
[5143.06s -> 5149.86s]  I didn't do the tutorial for this. What does this mean? Why? What's... Why? What's
[5149.86s -> 5164.07s]  going on with all the things in the background here?
[5164.07s -> 5173.64s]  That's all stars. All right, let's get onto the surface.
[5173.64s -> 5187.02s]  It can't be this bright on the surface, right? Holy shit, this is cool.
[5187.02s -> 5195.18s]  Imagine being able to stand here. How much did you pay to do this?
[5195.18s -> 5204.25s]  Press V. What's all these, like, divots and grooves and shit?
[5204.25s -> 5214.62s]  I want to get off of this. How do I let go?
[5214.70s -> 5222.87s]  V. Oh, photo mode was on the whole time. All right, let's get closer.
[5222.87s -> 5229.80s]  Can I take samples? Why can I take a sample? And why can't I
[5229.80s -> 5234.18s]  leave? How do I, like, deselect this planet? G? Shift?
[5234.18s -> 5238.38s]  F? I want to just fly around. Free mode here. Come on.
[5238.38s -> 5256.49s]  Free mode. F. I can't leave. What, is this place just huge?
[5256.49s -> 5264.97s]  Oh, fuck. It's that big. Oh, I get it. I feel like I'm crawling across
[5264.97s -> 5282.01s]  somebody's skin. It's a supergiant. Well, that's...
[5282.01s -> 5288.92s]  Who cares? I'm gonna go this way. What do you guys want to see?
[5288.92s -> 5294.98s]  The explosion between... Ooh, that's cool. Is that what they look like?
[5294.98s -> 5299.19s]  All right. And the Andromeda and... When did it happen?
[5299.19s -> 5317.11s]  When did the Andromeda crash? It's not in the game. Oh.
[5317.11s -> 5320.15s]  But look at that. Okay, what is this? This is a moon?
[5320.15s -> 5333.86s]  Oh, this is a planet. This is a star. This is a planet.
[5333.86s -> 5337.94s]  Go look at a black hole. I gotta find one. Hold on. I just got, like...
[5337.94s -> 5342.10s]  I just got, like, a shotgun blasted in, like, Overwatch
[5342.10s -> 5359.78s]  in the face. Slow down. I'm playing Overwatch.
[5359.78s -> 5362.66s]  That was... That wasn't... I wasn't making a kid joke. I was making, like, a...
[5362.66s -> 5366.10s]  That's what it felt like. I felt like I just got shot by, like, a
[5366.10s -> 5371.86s]  video game shotgun. What is this? This is called
[5371.86s -> 5386.46s]  Torrid Arid Super Terra. Whoa. That's a photo right there. Hold on.
[5386.46s -> 5390.01s]  That's a photo mode. The giant egg. The giant, like,
[5390.01s -> 5392.33s]  golden egg. I gotta get in a good spot for this.
[5392.33s -> 5400.65s]  Over here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hurry. Go, go, go, go, go. Right
[5400.65s -> 5423.48s]  here. On the ground. Photo mode. Let's go.
[5423.48s -> 5439.85s]  Oh, Jesus. Slow down. Why is it so bright?
[5439.85s -> 5451.05s]  That's kind of ominous. All right, here we go. No. No, no, no. Go back.
[5451.05s -> 5455.43s]  No! Oh, what have I done? That's fine. Right there.
[5455.43s -> 5465.62s]  Drop the magnitude a little bit. Right there. All right. Take it.
[5465.62s -> 5476.86s]  Got it. You want to see it orbit. Okay, fine. I can do that.
[5476.86s -> 5492.42s]  There it goes. I feel like I'm watching slow-mo a basketball go into
[5492.42s -> 5510.25s]  a hoop. I'm gonna pull out. There you go.
[5510.25s -> 5526.87s]  You can see its path here. This is cool. This is awesome.
[5526.87s -> 5560.12s]  Just get, like, eyes on this. It's kind of cool. All right, back to normal.
[5560.12s -> 5566.81s]  All right, let's go. I want to go somewhere else. I want to find a black hole.
[5566.81s -> 5574.02s]  They're both 3,500 degrees. Look for 55
[5574.02s -> 5579.61s]  cankri. A super earth made out of diamonds.
[5579.61s -> 5586.18s]  Wait, what? A super earth made out of diamonds.
[5586.18s -> 5600.82s]  What do you say it was called? Cankri? I don't think it's here.
[5600.82s -> 5615.27s]  Diana. 55 can... 55 cankri. No, it's not here.
[5615.27s -> 5620.33s]  Wait, there it is! 55 cankri right here. All right, did you tell me this is
[5620.33s -> 5627.54s]  made out of diamonds? That would be pretty crazy if it was.
[5627.54s -> 5647.93s]  Hold on. Orange dwarf. It is 5... 5,200 degrees.
[5647.93s -> 5659.16s]  Kelvin. This thing's millions of years old. That's the star. So where's the...
[5659.16s -> 5674.22s]  So this is 55 cankri Janssen. This is a planet. Is this it?
[5674.22s -> 5684.79s]  55 cankri E. This thing isn't made out of diamonds.
[5684.79s -> 5698.36s]  I mean, it looks like it's made out of wood. Let's land on it. Let's go.
[5698.36s -> 5729.35s]  I can't see shit. Am I on the planet? Oh, it's a photo!
[5729.35s -> 5732.71s]  It's because there's toxic fumes everywhere. All right, let me turn off the toxic
[5732.71s -> 5741.24s]  fumes. Atmospheres, nebula, clusters,
[5741.24s -> 5746.44s]  stars. Turn them all off. Turn off water. Turn off aurora.
[5746.44s -> 5750.52s]  Turn off planets. No, turn off comet tails. Turn off galaxies. Turn off
[5750.52s -> 5761.77s]  spacecraft. Turn on spacecraft. I mean, it looks pretty cool.
[5770.84s -> 5780.31s]  This one's cool. I need to turn this shit back on.
[5780.31s -> 5792.17s]  Comet tails, clouds, water, aurora. Any orbits there? There are. Okay, cool.
[5792.17s -> 5801.90s]  This thing's purple. This thing's nice. Turn on the HD. Look at that.
[5801.90s -> 5804.70s]  Is that happening right now? Is it happening right now? Hold on. Pause. Is
[5804.70s -> 5836.34s]  it happening right now? I'm gonna have a dozen desktop
[5836.34s -> 5849.85s]  backgrounds by the time this is done. Sell them. Sell them on like a
[5849.85s -> 5857.16s]  royalty-free website. That would mean they were free. All right, hold on. What
[5857.16s -> 5862.25s]  about... Check. I want to see the blue one. The
[5862.25s -> 5873.34s]  atmospheres are off. They shouldn't be. Oh, they are. You're right. But now we
[5873.34s -> 5879.27s]  can't see like the cool blue. What's this up here? Why is there a
[5879.27s -> 5900.22s]  ring up here? What is that for? That's magnetic field. That's kind of scary.
[5900.22s -> 5910.22s]  Kitchen. How is that a kitchen? Right there. Bingo.
[5910.22s -> 5920.28s]  Get one. Earth has one of those? That's interesting. All right, I want to
[5920.28s -> 5929.19s]  look... Where is... Let me go over here. Hold on. I want to find a
[5929.19s -> 5936.52s]  comet. What's like a popular one? What's like a cool one?
[5937.48s -> 5954.28s]  Haley's comet? Black hole. The Black Widow?
[5954.28s -> 5963.10s]  We gotta go see where the Black Widow is. Holy, this is a million... Jesus.
[5963.10s -> 5968.94s]  What is that? This is bright. I can't even get away from it.
[5968.94s -> 5974.71s]  It's peering into my soul. Is this temperature like
[5974.71s -> 5977.99s]  20-50 million degrees or something? Wow.
[5977.99s -> 5983.78s]  That's really cool looking. Turn all that shit off. Hold on. I can't even
[5983.78s -> 5998.44s]  turn it off. It's too bright. This is a neutron star. This is a black hole.
[5999.16s -> 6016.98s]  But what is it doing? Can I land on it? This is freaking me out.
[6019.16s -> 6023.34s]  The time is changing around it. Can I land on here? I'm gonna do this
[6023.34s -> 6054.98s]  gentle. Close your eyes. What happens if I go through this?
[6054.98s -> 6064.30s]  Well, I'm on it. This is it. Turn the mag down?
[6064.30s -> 6083.03s]  Should be reset, right? It's just ice. Ow.
[6083.03s -> 6092.34s]  All right. Hold on. Two million degrees. Don't you guys know when something's
[6092.34s -> 6098.02s]  so cold it becomes so hot? If something is like
[6098.10s -> 6101.30s]  negative 50 million degrees, it's gonna burn you. It's hot.
[6101.30s -> 6116.95s]  That's true. Hold on. I want to go to... Let's go to a nebula.
[6116.95s -> 6122.55s]  What about like, Warcraft names? There's gotta be like a thrall, right?
[6122.55s -> 6130.36s]  Damn it. Thrall? How about like, Zul'jin?
[6130.36s -> 6186.10s]  No. Jaraxxus? We're gonna find one. Come on. Come on.
[6186.10s -> 6194.25s]  How would I know these Warcraft names? Sagittarius.
[6194.25s -> 6205.74s]  All right, let's go. Holy shit. Should I go into that?
[6205.74s -> 6231.75s]  I got a good photo of this. That's so insane that this shit exists.
[6231.75s -> 6235.19s]  Oh, no. That's ingrown. That's ingrown. You're gonna have to just get tweezers to
[6235.19s -> 6240.41s]  get that one out. Nah, I can't help you there. You're
[6240.41s -> 6265.90s]  gonna have to go to a doctor, man. Negative 566. Give me a break.
[6265.90s -> 6280.92s]  Oh, give me a fucking break. What? I've made like three jokes. Oh, that's
[6280.92s -> 6291.56s]  bright. I gotta get the fuck away from
[6291.56s -> 6306.68s]  this. Whoa. Okay, that's cool. It's like a
[6306.68s -> 6309.48s]  lightning bolt going through this thing. That's crazy.
[6309.56s -> 6319.10s]  Land? Is this shit gonna start absorbing planets
[6319.10s -> 6336.66s]  and stars and stuff? That's crazy. All right, this actually is a perfect
[6336.66s -> 6356.17s]  home run. Right here. That looks great. I think that's the background
[6356.17s -> 6361.98s]  right there. I'm gonna land in it. I'm gonna turn
[6361.98s -> 6372.97s]  the exposure down. I'm going in. Let's see what happens. Wish me luck. I
[6372.97s -> 6374.57s]  think it actually is like sucking me in.
[6374.57s -> 6399.98s]  It just sucked me in. Where do I go? Can I leave?
[6399.98s -> 6445.56s]  Where the hell am I? What? This is Sagittarius A?
[6445.56s -> 6463.35s]  I'm following Sagittarius A. Oh, no. I clicked. I must have. I clicked
[6463.35s -> 6473.21s]  something else. No. Well, I got the photo. Yeah, go to.
[6473.21s -> 6476.89s]  What the hell? Go back out. Go back. No, no. Back out. Go back out. I want to see
[6476.89s -> 6483.37s]  that again. Go back out. That was potentially even
[6483.37s -> 6502.57s]  cooler than when I came in. What's this one?
[6502.57s -> 6508.44s]  Any of these have names? What? What do you mean the Milky Way?
[6508.44s -> 6524.12s]  That's a Milky Way? Oh, is it not? Is this the Milky Way?
[6524.12s -> 6531.58s]  This is the Milky Way? This is our galaxy.
[6531.58s -> 6551.05s]  I thought we were in a different galaxy. Blue main sequence star.
[6551.05s -> 6582.58s]  There it is. How far can I go out? I'll turn down the magnitude a little bit.
[6582.58s -> 6586.26s]  How much can I go? There's the Milky Way right there.
[6586.26s -> 6597.26s]  What happens when you go to the end? There can't be this many things, right?
[6597.26s -> 6605.24s]  No, there's no way. There's no way. How?
[6605.24s -> 6611.59s]  These are all galaxies. No, there's no way. If this is true,
[6611.59s -> 6622.89s]  no, if this is true, then we're actually like bugs in a petri dish.
[6622.89s -> 6631.98s]  All this shit? No, somebody sneezed and they scooped it up and put it under
[6631.98s -> 6635.14s]  a microscope and we just happened to be one of these.
[6635.14s -> 6652.60s]  Look at this shit. Let's go to this one. Look at this red one.
[6652.60s -> 6668.36s]  We're going to go to this red one. This is right here. What is this one?
[6668.36s -> 6676.73s]  Infinite galaxies. Somewhere on some computer is somebody else
[6676.73s -> 6685.13s]  playing this same game and he came across. No, he's not. He's not going
[6685.13s -> 6692.18s]  to come across Earth ever. That's not possible. Aliens? How come
[6692.18s -> 6697.82s]  aliens haven't found us yet? Oh, I don't know. Why do you think?
[6701.85s -> 6707.91s]  It's the equivalent of getting rained on outside. You know, if aliens existed,
[6707.91s -> 6718.20s]  they would have already found us. Oh, really? Wouldn't they have?
[6718.20s -> 6723.24s]  This is a blizzard. Can you pick me out one individual snowflake that's going
[6723.24s -> 6732.47s]  by right now? You know, they would have had some
[6732.47s -> 6735.83s]  means of communication. You think that some aliens would
[6735.83s -> 6738.33s]  have some means of communication? You think so.
[6738.33s -> 6744.06s]  You know the telephone was invented like fucking like 70 years ago, right?
[6744.06s -> 6748.33s]  And we can only talk to like other assholes on this planet.
[6750.06s -> 6753.66s]  You know how long this shit would take? Well, some of them have been around.
[6753.66s -> 6755.98s]  I guarantee you some of them don't even have a damn telephone. They still
[6755.98s -> 6758.46s]  scream at each other out their windows in alien space.
[6758.46s -> 6762.73s]  Why do we have this weird fantasy world that aliens have technology that
[6762.73s -> 6769.91s]  can make a cell phone call like 500 trillion light years away?
[6769.91s -> 6773.14s]  You lose cell phone coverage when you go through a tunnel.
[6773.14s -> 6777.46s]  And we are literally seen as like the most advanced fucking species on our
[6777.46s -> 6780.73s]  planet. You think somebody else is going
[6780.73s -> 6800.44s]  to have better technology? No fucking way. He knows too much.
[6800.44s -> 6815.96s]  What is this? All right, this is the one. This is Galaxy RG 06229807.
[6815.96s -> 6837.75s]  Well, let's get in there. Let me in there. I can't get in here?
[6837.75s -> 6847.67s]  Increase the brightness? Are there no planets in this galaxy?
[6847.67s -> 6863.42s]  There's nothing even here. It's just gas and hairspray.
[6863.42s -> 6869.10s]  I wonder why we haven't had a fucking phone call from Dave the Alien.
[6869.10s -> 6873.46s]  There's no gas out here. There's nobody out here. Wait, hold on.
[6873.46s -> 6899.69s]  This is a star. Cut his mic. Cut his mic. Imagine being on one of these planets
[6899.69s -> 6909.59s]  though. That would suck. Look at how shitty this
[6909.59s -> 6914.92s]  fucking planet is. Imagine you lived here. This is the
[6914.92s -> 6918.62s]  equivalent of living like in the middle of Nebraska.
[6918.62s -> 6930.49s]  There ain't nothing cool here. Come on, fly there. I'm pressing G.
[6930.49s -> 6937.66s]  Can I not go to this one? Oh, it's because I'm not going fast enough.
[6937.66s -> 6954.68s]  Oh, this one's pretty. Okay, why can't I move? Dude, look at this thing.
[6954.68s -> 6981.08s]  This thing sucks. How hot is it here? Caramel popcorn. These are parts of space
[6981.08s -> 6986.82s]  that are so far away that everything looks like a single star.
[6986.82s -> 6991.21s]  I can't wait for the fucking alien to get here because it's not going to be
[6991.21s -> 6996.52s]  like, here they come on their spaceships
[6996.52s -> 7000.44s]  and they have they have space rifles. No, it's going to be one alien is
[7000.44s -> 7002.44s]  going to accidentally fucking press the wrong button and he's going to
[7002.44s -> 7005.48s]  have like a Tom Hanks beard and he's going to fall out of his
[7005.48s -> 7011.00s]  space boat. And he's not going to be able to talk to him.
[7011.00s -> 7016.76s]  And guys, this already probably happened.
[7016.76s -> 7022.04s]  The government like vacuumed out his brain and just like looked at it under a
[7022.04s -> 7033.43s]  fucking computer screen. This already happened. Cut his mic.
[7033.43s -> 7043.51s]  That is a kind of cool looking planet though. It's not even that's a
[7043.51s -> 7048.09s]  star on a planet. All right, hold on. Let's get the gas
[7048.09s -> 7053.56s]  back here. All right, where's like the New
[7053.64s -> 7059.26s]  York City of this galaxy? Because that ain't it. Where is it?
[7059.26s -> 7068.60s]  Let's turn on the little thing here to show us. Detail. Let's see.
[7068.60s -> 7079.13s]  Give us some detail. It's a star. I know I'm looking for a planet.
[7079.13s -> 7094.28s]  All right, get this off. The government has made
[7094.28s -> 7102.66s]  video games about aliens. We also have this weird
[7102.66s -> 7107.48s]  picture of what is that? I'm going there. We have this like strange
[7107.48s -> 7110.28s]  picture of what aliens look like. They probably,
[7110.28s -> 7118.34s]  for there to be aliens that exist too. I think I just found the fucking New
[7118.34s -> 7130.31s]  York City. What the? Look at that. Is this a star?
[7130.31s -> 7139.37s]  That is a star and this is a star. Boring. Oh, nice galaxy you got here.
[7139.37s -> 7149.94s]  You got two street lamps. Where's the cool shit? What's that?
[7149.94s -> 7154.34s]  Warm super Jupiter. Wait, you get a super Jupiter here? Hold on.
[7154.34s -> 7169.16s]  They have a super Jupiter. I'll be the judge of that.
[7169.16s -> 7193.90s]  All right, that's pretty. Whoa. Quick, quick, quick, quick. Take it.
[7193.90s -> 7198.47s]  Take it like right now. Take it right now. Take it right now. Go, go, go, go, go.
[7198.47s -> 7201.43s]  That looks awesome. I can't wait. We're gonna go over these at the end of the
[7201.43s -> 7231.99s]  stream. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Check this shit out. Come on,
[7231.99s -> 7257.91s]  give me control. Hold on. Oh, yeah, we got it.
[7257.91s -> 7265.22s]  Oh, here are there. Here we go. Orange super giant.
[7265.22s -> 7270.58s]  Dwarf moon. What does that mean? Look at. Wow, I was wrong.
[7270.58s -> 7282.58s]  I had my GPS wasn't on right. It's an asteroid. So what does that do?
[7282.58s -> 7299.18s]  A bit of a trail. Get there faster. This is a rock.
[7299.18s -> 7316.17s]  This is a stone. What was I expecting? Oh, that's right. It's an asteroid.
[7316.17s -> 7320.26s]  How are there even rocks out here? That's something I really don't understand.
[7320.26s -> 7333.37s]  Does this move? What is a rock doing out here? What the hell is this here for?
[7333.37s -> 7336.41s]  What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What just happened? Go back.
[7336.41s -> 7339.70s]  Rewind. Do you see that? What the hell was that?
[7339.70s -> 7350.74s]  Something just reversed time. There was a shooting star back here.
[7350.74s -> 7367.37s]  Wait for it. What's that fucking thing? No, just pull out.
[7367.37s -> 7381.35s]  No, no, no. I want to go to that thing. This is another rock.
[7381.35s -> 7402.41s]  That's cool. Wait a minute. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[7402.41s -> 7407.06s]  Get another photo here. Looks pretty cool. That is a nice looking rock.
[7407.06s -> 7410.89s]  You're right. Although I want that like in the back.
[7410.89s -> 7414.25s]  Hold on. That's fine. This is good. It's like an ice rock.
[7414.25s -> 7423.32s]  No, I didn't get the whole thing. Take it again. I want a good close-up
[7423.32s -> 7437.03s]  of the ice rock. Ooh, this is like a peak. That looks
[7437.03s -> 7441.37s]  cool. Save it. It looks like shit. How does it?
[7441.37s -> 7446.01s]  What do you mean looks like shit? You think this looks like shit?
[7446.01s -> 7465.37s]  I want to get it good. There we go. Like that. This alien life form here.
[7465.37s -> 7480.18s]  Hold on. Give me something cool here like that. Up a little.
[7480.18s -> 7493.67s]  Drop the exposure. No, no, no. Put it back. Man.
[7493.67s -> 7503.69s]  Drop the exposure a little bit more. Hold on. Right there. Got it.
[7503.69s -> 7510.81s]  That's beautiful. This is beautiful. All right. Viewer's choice. Where are we
[7510.81s -> 7519.54s]  going? And what year? So basically, just
[7519.54s -> 7529.40s]  delete that. Go to Earth's Moon 2018.
[7529.40s -> 7547.56s]  That sounds... Why 2018? Oh, shit. I'm reversing time.
[7548.33s -> 7560.49s]  What did that... That was fucking cool. I just broke the fucking... I crashed the
[7560.49s -> 7568.87s]  game. God damn it. Come on. Did I... Where is it? What's the matter? What was
[7568.87s -> 7583.43s]  that an error for? I don't have an error. Okay, that's weird.
[7583.43s -> 7592.58s]  All right. You want me to go to the moon, right? Earth Moon.
[7592.58s -> 7609.43s]  Go to the Earth Moon. Why 2018? What happens on 2018?
[7609.43s -> 7623.18s]  Where did they land? What a waste of viewer's choice. Go to the Earth Moon.
[7623.18s -> 7626.22s]  Well, hold on a minute here. Hold on. How fast can you walk? Like 20 miles per
[7626.22s -> 7633.93s]  hour? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. This is cool.
[7633.93s -> 7646.22s]  We get to actually see the surface of the moon. Right here.
[7646.22s -> 7655.13s]  But what do you want me to do? Find the footsteps. I don't think they're
[7655.13s -> 7670.82s]  gonna have that. Why 2018? Find the flag. Make a damn
[7670.82s -> 7677.08s]  spaceship already. I didn't... Spacecraft manager? I don't
[7677.08s -> 7679.48s]  have one. Can I... How do I... Can I make one?
[7679.48s -> 7699.62s]  How do I make one? You can spawn in a spacecraft.
[7699.62s -> 7702.74s]  Go to the menu. Do I have to save this? Why would I have to save it? I can just
[7702.74s -> 7721.30s]  type in moon. Flight simulator? Build. Space engine.
[7721.30s -> 7733.75s]  Aliens. Fire. Fire Dragonfly Starship. Build it.
[7733.75s -> 7743.74s]  Okay, so take control of it. What? Main engine. I didn't... I don't have
[7743.74s -> 7750.31s]  this tutorial. There's a lot going on here. Flight
[7750.31s -> 7765.78s]  assist. How fast am I going? Main engines. Okay, main engines are on.
[7765.78s -> 7772.04s]  Thrusters. On. I'm going 2,000 miles per hour. How do I move?
[7772.04s -> 7789.64s]  Orp. Warp. Orp. Net 32. What is this ball of yarn over here?
[7789.64s -> 7795.69s]  What is this? Saturn's moon? I want to go that way.
[7795.69s -> 7805.00s]  Saturn's moon. Land on Saturn's moon. Main engines. On.
[7805.00s -> 7811.80s]  Dock. No docking ports available. Where are you going?
[7811.80s -> 7830.87s]  Is it like flying itself? Select star and then click warp to.
[7830.95s -> 7837.70s]  Normal up. Rotate to target. Kill rotation.
[7837.70s -> 7844.17s]  Switch view. Here we go. View ship trajectory.
[7844.17s -> 7853.93s]  Oh, all right. Switch view. Okay, and then warp.
[7853.93s -> 7860.92s]  I'm warping here. All right, here we go. Main engines at 100.
[7860.92s -> 7879.21s]  Thrusters. Engaged. Go for it. Do I have to do anything else?
[7879.21s -> 7894.87s]  Or will it just do it on its own? Is it going to crash?
[7894.87s -> 7902.50s]  Am I going to crash into this planet? Yeah, I'm fine.
[7902.50s -> 7910.23s]  That's what it looks like on the inside, huh? Shredded tax documents.
[7910.87s -> 7917.66s]  Wow. So this is like the shredder planet. Cool. All right, let's push it.
[7917.66s -> 7928.81s]  Push the planet. I can't push the planet. How about orb? Oh, that's orbit.
[7928.81s -> 7931.62s]  What about H-O-R? What does that mean?
[7934.82s -> 7947.00s]  Whore. What is whore? What is whore? All right, go that way.
[7947.00s -> 7959.18s]  Well, all right. Well, I can right click and land.
[7959.18s -> 7965.67s]  Am I still on the spaceship? Oh, is that my spaceship's out here.
[7971.16s -> 7977.22s]  Okay. Well, that was fun. I jumped out of the spaceship into the space.
[7977.78s -> 8000.07s]  What is the planetarium? Why does the moon look like this now?
[8000.07s -> 8014.70s]  Oh, it's just there. All right, I want to go to two more places.
[8014.70s -> 8018.81s]  And then I'm going to do something else. This is fun, though.
[8018.81s -> 8033.26s]  No, like five more places. Go to the year 2077.
[8033.98s -> 8045.02s]  Earth. There's a Sauron? Where is it?
[8045.02s -> 8049.32s]  Well, that's a lot stupider than I thought it was going to be.
[8049.48s -> 8062.55s]  Stupid's the wrong word. Listen, what is that down there?
[8062.55s -> 8065.18s]  All right. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8065.18s -> 8073.74s]  We've got red blood land cluster and then big orange.
[8073.74s -> 8083.48s]  Let's go red. Type diffuse. California nebula.
[8083.48s -> 8095.74s]  Let's go. What's this one? G1. Yellow giant. Star Capella.
[8095.74s -> 8100.47s]  All right, we're going to go much faster than this.
[8109.98s -> 8112.38s]  I'm missing so many planets. All right, hold on.
[8112.38s -> 8116.87s]  This is it right here. California nebula.
[8124.58s -> 8128.26s]  One of these days, one of these just giant red toxic poison clouds
[8128.26s -> 8136.23s]  is just going to cross Earth's path. Shift F3.
[8139.80s -> 8148.84s]  Search for star browsers. Go to search.
[8150.76s -> 8152.60s]  Oh, you can see how many stars and how many planets.
[8152.60s -> 8157.48s]  Life. Hold on, there's life on some of these planets?
[8157.48s -> 8159.72s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you mean life?
[8167.90s -> 8178.87s]  Wait, wait, wait. This for planet A3.
[8178.87s -> 8181.27s]  All right, hold on. We'll close this for a second.
[8181.27s -> 8187.85s]  I want to check out the red fumes. What's in the red fumes?
[8187.85s -> 8203.24s]  Something in here. Star. I'm not going to say that.
[8203.24s -> 8207.80s]  I was going to say Final Fantasy, but I'm already just barely
[8207.80s -> 8209.88s]  breaking even right now on the joke meter,
[8209.88s -> 8211.72s]  and I don't want to cause a problem on that.
[8218.22s -> 8220.22s]  I didn't do anything. You can't just write minus two.
[8220.22s -> 8225.24s]  I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything.
[8225.24s -> 8232.55s]  No, I didn't. Oh, that's unfair. That was unfair minus twos.
[8233.94s -> 8234.98s]  All right, I want to see what this is.
[8235.62s -> 8249.56s]  Percy. Let's see what Percy is.
[8250.12s -> 8252.94s]  Percy is actually pretty cool looking.
[8263.72s -> 8272.54s]  Whoa. I want it right on the left side there.
[8273.18s -> 8275.26s]  I want that in the background too, like this.
[8276.22s -> 8282.02s]  Like over here maybe. I don't know.
[8282.02s -> 8283.30s]  I don't know. I don't know.
[8283.30s -> 8285.46s]  I don't know. I know I want that.
[8286.18s -> 8288.84s]  Like this. I don't know.
[8297.02s -> 8298.70s]  What the hell is going on here?
[8299.42s -> 8312.20s]  All right, this just looks like when you used to have
[8312.20s -> 8315.70s]  a disposable camera and like six of the photos
[8315.70s -> 8317.70s]  when you got them developed would look like this
[8317.70s -> 8320.36s]  because you had to shake your fucking hand on it and shit.
[8320.36s -> 8329.62s]  So, all right, turn it off auto.
[8329.62s -> 8330.42s]  That's even worse.
[8336.81s -> 8338.09s]  I almost want to like go.
[8338.09s -> 8341.13s]  Hold on. This is super duper.
[8342.73s -> 8353.50s]  Just take it. Take the photo.
[8353.50s -> 8355.34s]  I can't wait until we go over these at the end
[8355.34s -> 8358.46s]  and you just go, holy shit, he's talented.
[8358.46s -> 8365.00s]  All right, what was that going?
[8365.56s -> 8367.64s]  Oh, the planet with a life on it.
[8367.64s -> 8369.34s]  Let's go get a sample.
[8369.90s -> 8374.01s]  Let's go have one of like the space cows peeing in a jar.
[8374.57s -> 8380.89s]  Where was that? Shift F3.
[8381.45s -> 8386.66s]  All right, this one right here is a this system here.
[8387.93s -> 8389.05s]  So there's life here.
[8389.69s -> 8393.30s]  Where the hell am I?
[8393.94s -> 8395.14s]  Life on these planets?
[8395.86s -> 8409.75s]  Let me open that back up.
[8412.49s -> 8413.93s]  There's life on one of these planets.
[8415.40s -> 8419.24s]  RS8 and within one light year.
[8422.84s -> 8424.84s]  Filted like there's 18 planets here.
[8424.84s -> 8425.64s]  But what do you mean life?
[8427.80s -> 8429.72s]  251. Like that's where I am.
[8431.18s -> 8439.99s]  But like which one of these has life on it?
[8439.99s -> 8440.87s]  Barrie Center?
[8441.43s -> 8450.98s]  What the hell is this?
[8451.62s -> 8472.02s]  Well, get there.
[8472.02s -> 8472.42s]  Let's go.
[8472.42s -> 8475.74s]  Gee, take me to the Barrie Center.
[8475.74s -> 8477.02s]  What the hell is going on here?
[8477.02s -> 8479.46s]  Here we go.
[8479.46s -> 8481.02s]  Does it say if there's life on it?
[8481.58s -> 8492.01s]  All right, there's life on this planet.
[8492.01s -> 8495.14s]  Oh, life on this one.
[8507.62s -> 8508.34s]  The timing.
[8508.34s -> 8508.82s]  Wait, did it?
[8510.02s -> 8510.98s]  Oh, I want to see.
[8510.98s -> 8511.62s]  Clip it.
[8511.62s -> 8512.34s]  I want to see it.
[8513.80s -> 8514.68s]  I want to see that.
[8515.70s -> 8546.18s]  I want to see it.
[8546.18s -> 8547.62s]  That's so stupid.
[8548.68s -> 8560.46s]  It's like I had a button queued up
[8560.46s -> 8561.90s]  and pressed it at the perfect time.
[8561.90s -> 8562.22s]  All right.
[8562.86s -> 8568.34s]  I need to find the life on this damn planet.
[8574.04s -> 8575.88s]  No, not the main menu yet, dummy.
[8577.96s -> 8578.44s]  F2.
[8579.96s -> 8581.00s]  Let me check this one.
[8583.29s -> 8585.45s]  Green text in Barrie Center.
[8586.09s -> 8587.29s]  All right, there's apparently life here.
[8591.35s -> 8593.51s]  Let's take this down to like 10 times
[8593.51s -> 8594.63s]  and let's go explore the planet.
[8595.35s -> 8597.83s]  There's life on this planet.
[8598.39s -> 8605.50s]  How do I find it?
[8605.50s -> 8615.91s]  Is it just water?
[8615.91s -> 8623.62s]  I swear to God if an alien shows up.
[8623.62s -> 8624.10s]  Found it.
[8624.10s -> 8624.82s]  Look at that.
[8624.82s -> 8626.78s]  It's like a snow snow.
[8626.78s -> 8627.74s]  It's a crack.
[8627.74s -> 8631.10s]  I thought it was a snake.
[8631.10s -> 8641.06s]  Is it like a life-o-meter?
[8641.06s -> 8643.93s]  Can I pull up a thing to see if I can find it somewhere?
[8643.93s -> 8651.21s]  The moons have life, but you won't see it.
[8658.34s -> 8659.62s]  No life on this planet.
[8659.62s -> 8660.74s]  Go to the moons.
[8663.75s -> 8666.42s]  Go to moon.
[8666.42s -> 8667.06s]  All right.
[8667.06s -> 8670.02s]  Wait, I think those are those life orbs.
[8670.02s -> 8675.00s]  How could there be life on this planet?
[8675.00s -> 8676.44s]  Shit can't live on this.
[8676.44s -> 8680.38s]  How on earth are you supposed to live
[8680.38s -> 8682.30s]  on top of Nickelodeon Floam?
[8682.30s -> 8683.10s]  I don't understand.
[8683.74s -> 8684.86s]  Does it make any sense to me?
[8701.48s -> 8702.36s]  That was funny.
[8702.36s -> 8702.76s]  It was.
[8702.76s -> 8703.64s]  You just don't get it.
[8703.64s -> 8704.20s]  You just don't get it.
[8704.20s -> 8705.56s]  You didn't have Floam when you were a kid.
[8705.56s -> 8707.64s]  It hasn't existed in like 15 years.
[8707.64s -> 8711.19s]  I feel like this is a conspiracy against me today.
[8715.38s -> 8716.66s]  There's a joke conspiracy against me
[8716.66s -> 8718.02s]  ever since we started talking about it.
[8718.02s -> 8728.33s]  It's actually kind of cool looking.
[8728.33s -> 8729.77s]  You think we're under 15?
[8730.49s -> 8730.73s]  No.
[8732.41s -> 8737.24s]  Nobody had Floam and I didn't even have Floam.
[8737.24s -> 8741.43s]  I had it for like an hour.
[8741.43s -> 8742.71s]  I've liked that one.
[8742.71s -> 8744.07s]  I'm keeping that one.
[8744.07s -> 8746.68s]  All right.
[8746.68s -> 8747.48s]  Let me turn off the...
[8748.44s -> 8749.40s]  That actually looks kind of good.
[8749.88s -> 8752.90s]  No, but I didn't have it though.
[8752.90s -> 8753.78s]  Somebody brought it over.
[8755.48s -> 8757.00s]  Somebody brought it over
[8757.00s -> 8757.96s]  and they took it out of the package
[8757.96s -> 8759.08s]  and we were playing it
[8759.08s -> 8760.68s]  and I stole some.
[8760.68s -> 8761.80s]  When they went to the bathroom
[8761.80s -> 8764.12s]  I pulled off like a little corner of it
[8764.12s -> 8765.80s]  and then spread the rest of it out
[8765.80s -> 8766.76s]  inside the container
[8766.76s -> 8769.00s]  so it looked like there was nothing missing.
[8769.00s -> 8771.51s]  Then I put it into a little shoe box
[8771.51s -> 8773.27s]  and then I had my own Nickelodeon Floam.
[8790.41s -> 8790.73s]  All right.
[8791.53s -> 8793.45s]  Let me go ahead and tell you something here.
[8794.25s -> 8797.29s]  Me telling you about a bad thing I did
[8797.29s -> 8799.24s]  when I was younger
[8799.24s -> 8802.44s]  is not a minus two scenario.
[8802.44s -> 8811.38s]  Oh, I can't believe you did that bad thing
[8811.38s -> 8812.18s]  when you were a kid.
[8813.05s -> 8814.57s]  That wasn't a funny joke.
[8814.57s -> 8816.73s]  Oh, am I dead?
[8816.73s -> 8819.38s]  Is Dream dead?
[8819.38s -> 8827.08s]  Yeah, guys.
[8827.08s -> 8830.65s]  One time I ate a bowl of fucking cereal.
[8830.65s -> 8833.51s]  Yeah.
[8833.51s -> 8834.15s]  Minus two.
[8848.94s -> 8850.06s]  Theft isn't funny.
[8850.06s -> 8851.18s]  It's not a...
[8851.18s -> 8851.82s]  Yeah.
[8851.82s -> 8852.86s]  It's not a joke.
[8853.50s -> 8854.78s]  Theft is not a joke.
[8854.78s -> 8856.94s]  Therefore, there's no reason for it to be a joke
[8856.94s -> 8858.70s]  and I'm stuck in the quicksand.
[8869.37s -> 8871.05s]  I'm climbing back by the end of this stream.
[8872.66s -> 8873.46s]  I ain't going to let this...
[8874.02s -> 8875.38s]  Oh, this looks good.
[8875.38s -> 8878.97s]  How about right here?
[8878.97s -> 8880.89s]  Everyone's working against me now
[8880.89s -> 8882.95s]  because they know, oh, he wants to try to break even
[8882.95s -> 8883.83s]  on the Joko meter.
[8883.83s -> 8885.11s]  Oh, I'm not going to let that happen
[8885.11s -> 8887.11s]  every time he says something I can say minus two.
[8887.11s -> 8899.93s]  Let me go...
[8900.89s -> 8902.46s]  Let me go where...
[8902.46s -> 8903.18s]  Let's go here.
[8903.18s -> 8903.98s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8903.98s -> 8904.54s]  What was the...
[8904.54s -> 8908.26s]  Let me look at this.
[8908.26s -> 8912.62s]  Oh, there's an egg.
[8912.62s -> 8914.78s]  There's an egg nebula.
[8914.78s -> 8915.50s]  Let's go.
[8915.50s -> 8924.73s]  Holy shit, you ate a bowl of cereal.
[8924.73s -> 8926.49s]  Fucking plus two.
[8928.50s -> 8931.74s]  Hey, guys.
[8932.54s -> 8933.98s]  Do you like Coca-Cola?
[8933.98s -> 8934.48s]  Me too.
[8937.72s -> 8943.54s]  Give me a fucking break.
[8959.82s -> 8963.86s]  I'm definitely going to get a picture of this.
[8963.86s -> 8967.64s]  This is fucking so stupid.
[8970.65s -> 8972.17s]  So fucking funny.
[8972.17s -> 8973.37s]  Minus two Pepsi is better,
[8973.37s -> 8973.93s]  but that's like...
[8974.98s -> 8976.66s]  Opinions aren't jokes either.
[8979.82s -> 8984.54s]  You know, I thought Endgame was like a really good movie.
[8984.54s -> 8985.26s]  Minus two.
[8986.47s -> 8987.27s]  No, no, what?
[8989.30s -> 8990.26s]  That's not a joke.
[8991.53s -> 8992.89s]  No, stop doing...
[8992.89s -> 9003.83s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[9003.83s -> 9005.59s]  He's got opinions.
[9005.59s -> 9006.95s]  All right, let's get in the egg nebula.
[9012.46s -> 9016.06s]  I wonder if we can find some spies inside the egg nebula.
[9016.06s -> 9017.18s]  I wonder if that's possible.
[9032.44s -> 9033.32s]  That's guaranteed.
[9033.32s -> 9034.04s]  I will game...
[9034.04s -> 9034.76s]  You want to game...
[9034.76s -> 9035.64s]  You want to game me?
[9035.64s -> 9036.84s]  I'm going to game you.
[9036.84s -> 9040.07s]  I will get that to positive by the end of the stream.
[9044.50s -> 9045.62s]  You're already falling for it.
[9045.62s -> 9046.34s]  I already got you.
[9050.74s -> 9053.14s]  Washed up streamer gives into nostalgia.
[9053.14s -> 9061.32s]  What are we at?
[9061.32s -> 9061.80s]  What are we at?
[9061.80s -> 9062.76s]  What's the total?
[9062.76s -> 9063.56s]  Let me see your total.
[9066.18s -> 9067.78s]  I'm deleting that, by the way.
[9067.78s -> 9068.58s]  That's like...
[9068.58s -> 9071.38s]  That is like the self-conscious mode active.
[9072.02s -> 9079.78s]  I got to look over here and just like, wait a minute.
[9079.78s -> 9080.18s]  Where am I?
[9080.18s -> 9081.70s]  Am I at my funny score?
[9082.57s -> 9085.13s]  I don't want to have to have that climbing up my ass.
[9091.64s -> 9094.36s]  Or I only want that available at the end of the stream.
[9094.36s -> 9098.31s]  That's going to put too much pressure on me.
[9098.31s -> 9100.15s]  I'm going to look over and it's going to be like, oh, total.
[9100.15s -> 9102.87s]  Wow, he sucks.
[9102.87s -> 9104.07s]  No, no, I don't.
[9104.07s -> 9105.19s]  I don't suck, do I?
[9105.19s -> 9114.94s]  Let's go on this one.
[9114.94s -> 9115.66s]  That's worse.
[9116.46s -> 9135.24s]  Look, I know this looks like the gravel circle in Garden Flipper.
[9135.24s -> 9138.66s]  That's just an observation.
[9138.66s -> 9139.46s]  I'm not making a joke.
[9139.46s -> 9140.34s]  That's an observation.
[9140.90s -> 9154.34s]  Come on, I want to get like a...
[9154.34s -> 9156.94s]  Can I take the atmosphere on?
[9161.58s -> 9162.70s]  Let me see what happens when I do this.
[9163.26s -> 9165.96s]  No, it doesn't help.
[9165.96s -> 9166.44s]  Doesn't help.
[9173.53s -> 9175.21s]  Go to the sun and see if it's super nervous.
[9176.07s -> 9186.14s]  I don't think any actual things happen in the game.
[9186.14s -> 9188.62s]  I think it just is interesting to do.
[9188.62s -> 9190.62s]  I think there's certain events that you can see.
[9190.62s -> 9195.21s]  Maybe there's no like physics simulation.
[9195.21s -> 9197.45s]  Yeah, nothing currently aware of.
[9197.45s -> 9198.25s]  This is a cool planet.
[9198.81s -> 9202.92s]  I get this one like a D minus, like a C plus, maybe.
[9206.52s -> 9212.82s]  Turn back on the magnitude.
[9213.38s -> 9214.34s]  I'm like very far away.
[9214.34s -> 9215.14s]  Hold on.
[9215.14s -> 9220.23s]  What am I?
[9220.23s -> 9221.27s]  I'm like lost here.
[9221.99s -> 9224.50s]  There we go.
[9227.75s -> 9228.47s]  What am I going to go?
[9229.19s -> 9237.53s]  I should play universe sandbox.
[9238.25s -> 9240.78s]  I could check that out eventually.
[9241.66s -> 9245.42s]  That star took billions of years to form and you gave it a D minus.
[9249.14s -> 9252.81s]  Yeah, and what's the problem?
[9254.82s -> 9255.62s]  I don't see a problem.
[9256.18s -> 9264.18s]  That's rude.
[9267.53s -> 9269.45s]  Planets don't have feelings.
[9272.44s -> 9279.70s]  They have bottles of gas, water, and vapor.
[9279.70s -> 9284.02s]  They don't get sad about not being cool.
[9284.66s -> 9290.66s]  I'll tell you what is cool.
[9290.66s -> 9291.38s]  This.
[9291.38s -> 9292.98s]  Let's get a good view of this.
[9293.54s -> 9302.94s]  It looks like a double star here.
[9302.94s -> 9305.29s]  I got to drop.
[9305.29s -> 9305.93s]  Oh, hold on.
[9306.57s -> 9307.13s]  I like this.
[9307.77s -> 9311.67s]  Slow it down a little.
[9311.67s -> 9315.61s]  Get up.
[9315.61s -> 9315.93s]  Maybe.
[9315.93s -> 9316.17s]  Nah.
[9316.17s -> 9316.89s]  What am I going to go?
[9324.28s -> 9324.84s]  Right in here.
[9324.84s -> 9326.12s]  And let's zoom it out a little bit.
[9326.68s -> 9330.25s]  And then I want to turn on.
[9331.53s -> 9336.62s]  I mean like that's again from your disposable camera.
[9336.62s -> 9337.66s]  You took a picture of the sun.
[9338.30s -> 9344.12s]  I've got I got an idea for a stream.
[9344.68s -> 9346.86s]  Oh yeah.
[9346.86s -> 9347.74s]  This is going to happen.
[9348.73s -> 9350.01s]  Oh, this is going to happen real soon.
[9350.57s -> 9354.20s]  I'm not even doing anything.
[9354.20s -> 9357.66s]  Everyone's this is you guys a game in the system here.
[9358.52s -> 9363.72s]  I'm going to buy like five disposable cameras and like go on a trip.
[9364.60s -> 9366.76s]  And I'm not going to I'm going to develop them.
[9367.88s -> 9371.88s]  And then I'm going to show you I'm going to show up to you on stream.
[9371.88s -> 9386.71s]  I'm going to go like this.
[9387.43s -> 9392.30s]  No more magnitude.
[9392.94s -> 9398.22s]  What is that?
[9399.69s -> 9401.13s]  No, I want that looks all right.
[9403.35s -> 9403.99s]  Fire watch.
[9403.99s -> 9407.67s]  Yeah, but the difference with fire watch is those are taken in the game.
[9407.67s -> 9412.34s]  Like I'm going to really go on like a trip.
[9418.42s -> 9419.37s]  Oh, shit.
[9420.01s -> 9421.96s]  All right.
[9421.96s -> 9422.36s]  What do you say?
[9422.36s -> 9422.76s]  What do you say?
[9422.76s -> 9425.56s]  Like about five minutes of this and I'm going to just go to the bathroom.
[9425.56s -> 9426.92s]  We'll come back and do something else.
[9426.92s -> 9434.60s]  All right.
[9434.60s -> 9438.52s]  I'm going to we're going to type in random letters here because the just
[9438.52s -> 9440.12s]  I'm going to just whatever you have in chat here.
[9446.92s -> 9447.56s]  I see J.
[9448.20s -> 9452.52s]  I see Q.
[9457.16s -> 9457.56s]  J.
[9457.56s -> 9457.88s]  Q.
[9463.42s -> 9463.82s]  Damn it.
[9470.90s -> 9471.22s]  J.
[9471.22s -> 9471.46s]  S.
[9474.62s -> 9475.02s]  J.
[9475.02s -> 9477.42s]  S one eight three B.
[9478.14s -> 9483.37s]  And then I'm going to go as fast as I possibly can and try to get to the end of the world.
[9484.25s -> 9486.33s]  Now, that's a cool looking fucking zone.
[9487.80s -> 9491.83s]  I can't wait to level up here.
[9491.83s -> 9493.27s]  What's the level limit?
[9493.27s -> 9493.99s]  10 to 25.
[9494.63s -> 9494.79s]  Nice.
[9494.79s -> 9495.35s]  You want to go here?
[9496.31s -> 9496.71s]  Nice.
[9496.71s -> 9497.27s]  I do too.
[9501.86s -> 9502.26s]  Bullshit.
[9502.26s -> 9503.54s]  You guys are liars.
[9503.54s -> 9504.18s]  Liars.
[9504.18s -> 9504.58s]  Liars.
[9504.58s -> 9505.06s]  All of you.
[9505.80s -> 9509.88s]  I don't care about some arbitrary rating system.
[9509.88s -> 9530.94s]  I want to get like in here though.
[9530.94s -> 9532.06s]  Now, that's an awesome view.
[9532.70s -> 9534.26s]  Let's go in here.
[9541.75s -> 9542.71s]  It does look like Neptune.
[9543.35s -> 9546.33s]  Go see Messier 82.
[9546.97s -> 9554.07s]  I'll check it out.
[9560.66s -> 9567.91s]  I haven't even gone to see like Jupiter and Mars and stuff.
[9567.91s -> 9569.35s]  Messier 82.
[9569.35s -> 9570.07s]  Let's try it.
[9570.07s -> 9577.21s]  I don't know.
[9577.21s -> 9577.93s]  Where is it?
[9577.93s -> 9586.01s]  It's not here.
[9586.01s -> 9586.57s]  There's nothing here.
[9588.41s -> 9589.29s]  M82.
[9589.93s -> 9599.18s]  That's a pretty good chat's choice.
[9599.18s -> 9611.77s]  This looks good.
[9611.77s -> 9616.66s]  Pick at that.
[9616.66s -> 9616.98s]  Okay.
[9618.50s -> 9625.61s]  What about anything in here that's interesting to see?
[9625.61s -> 9638.20s]  It's cool.
[9638.20s -> 9646.73s]  A crab nebula?
[9646.73s -> 9648.01s]  I think I feel like I've seen this before.
[9658.47s -> 9659.99s]  It's cool looking I guess.
[9659.99s -> 9665.67s]  What's the one back here?
[9665.67s -> 9673.32s]  If you call something a crab nebula, don't you expect it to have claws
[9673.32s -> 9674.76s]  or look kind of like a crab?
[9674.76s -> 9676.12s]  Why would it be crab nebula?
[9676.12s -> 9684.28s]  What is this thing in here?
[9684.28s -> 9692.94s]  Can't even click it.
[9692.94s -> 9695.75s]  Not even clickable.
[9695.75s -> 9696.55s]  There it is.
[9696.55s -> 9700.60s]  I want to check this one out.
[9700.60s -> 9706.38s]  And I'm going to fly to this one.
[9706.38s -> 9708.42s]  Oh, this is cool.
[9708.42s -> 9709.70s]  This one is nice.
[9709.70s -> 9730.62s]  I want to fly like hordes of right there.
[9730.62s -> 9731.34s]  Right there.
[9731.34s -> 9731.90s]  Hold on.
[9731.90s -> 9742.02s]  I'll get out of here.
[9742.02s -> 9742.74s]  That's perfect.
[9747.40s -> 9748.52s]  What is that?
[9748.52s -> 9753.74s]  This feels like it doesn't belong.
[9753.74s -> 9755.58s]  I feel like this is an error in the game.
[9755.58s -> 9759.48s]  This is chewed up bubble gum that the developer accidentally left here.
[9759.48s -> 9767.91s]  I mean, it's cool looking.
[9767.91s -> 9769.51s]  Wait, I can get a pretty good picture here I think.
[9795.80s -> 9796.36s]  Looks pretty nice.
[9796.36s -> 9801.13s]  All right, cool.
[9801.13s -> 9801.77s]  All right.
[9801.77s -> 9810.12s]  What's the last place I'm going?
[9810.12s -> 9812.12s]  Somebody said the spirit of creation.
[9812.12s -> 9812.60s]  Whatever.
[9812.60s -> 9819.38s]  Something of creation.
[9819.38s -> 9820.74s]  Pillars of creation.
[9820.74s -> 9828.10s]  This is huge.
[9828.10s -> 9831.05s]  What the hell?
[9831.05s -> 9837.62s]  Is this a giant E?
[9837.62s -> 9838.18s]  E.
[9838.18s -> 9847.96s]  I'm still loading in shit.
[9847.96s -> 9866.23s]  What the hell is that?
[9866.23s -> 9867.11s]  How big is this?
[9879.56s -> 9881.08s]  That's huge.
[9881.08s -> 9891.14s]  Yeah, this is the Milky Way.
[9891.14s -> 9891.64s]  Wow.
[9894.50s -> 9894.90s]  All right.
[9894.90s -> 9895.22s]  Okay.
[9895.22s -> 9895.70s]  All right.
[9895.70s -> 9896.18s]  All right.
[9896.18s -> 9896.50s]  All right.
[9896.50s -> 9897.06s]  Yeah, I know.
[9909.24s -> 9910.92s]  I know it's our galaxy.
[9910.92s -> 9914.28s]  I just didn't know that like the crab nebula or I don't know.
[9914.28s -> 9919.64s]  I haven't taken like fucking ninth grade geography since the ninth grade.
[9919.64s -> 9920.84s]  I don't know that.
[9921.40s -> 9922.28s]  Why would I know that?
[9922.28s -> 9929.11s]  I haven't opened up like a ninth grade science book since I was in the ninth grade.
[9929.11s -> 9933.35s]  I don't remember that the pillars of creation are in our galaxy.
[9936.98s -> 9941.13s]  Why would I have that information right now?
[9941.13s -> 9946.04s]  Why would I remember this?
[9946.04s -> 9947.32s]  Click the flag.
[9947.40s -> 9948.92s]  I'm scared to click the flag.
[9948.92s -> 9950.57s]  Okay.
[9950.57s -> 9951.29s]  I can click the flag.
[9951.29s -> 9952.17s]  Wait, is that my address?
[9958.41s -> 9960.97s]  I saw my location.
[9960.97s -> 9964.01s]  I saw my location and I fucking freaked out.
[9964.01s -> 9964.33s]  Okay.
[9965.61s -> 9966.49s]  Spare me.
[9966.49s -> 9972.04s]  All right.
[9972.04s -> 9973.24s]  Look at the pillars of creation.
[9976.86s -> 9977.98s]  We saw that one.
[9977.98s -> 9979.34s]  Sunrise in hell.
[9979.34s -> 9993.46s]  Holy shit.
[9994.02s -> 9999.22s]  Good photo op coming up here I think in a fast forward time frame.
[9999.22s -> 9999.62s]  Watch this.
[9999.62s -> 10000.18s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[10002.04s -> 10002.84s]  Oh, hold on.
[10002.84s -> 10003.96s]  I don't even care where I am.
[10003.96s -> 10004.76s]  Who cares?
[10004.76s -> 10010.62s]  I would laugh so hard if I had a face on it.
[10010.62s -> 10042.58s]  I'll come back.
[10042.58s -> 10053.26s]  Come on and hurry up.
[10053.26s -> 10057.16s]  Come on.
[10057.16s -> 10058.04s]  Where is it?
[10058.04s -> 10059.78s]  Where did it go?
[10059.78s -> 10080.02s]  Here we go.
[10080.02s -> 10080.66s]  Ready?
[10080.66s -> 10087.75s]  Find me a better picture from anyone that's ever played this game.
[10088.31s -> 10106.25s]  That's going to be featured in a magazine.
[10110.94s -> 10113.10s]  Go to the Great Wall?
[10113.10s -> 10113.42s]  Hold on.
[10115.02s -> 10116.30s]  Let me see what this is even first.
[10116.30s -> 10117.02s]  Hold on.
[10117.02s -> 10120.20s]  This is like a lava gallery.
[10120.20s -> 10121.80s]  No, this is a crab galaxy.
[10121.80s -> 10123.02s]  Okay.
[10123.02s -> 10126.14s]  If it were me making the rules, this would be the crab nebula.
[10126.14s -> 10126.86s]  Take a look.
[10126.86s -> 10128.97s]  This is a crab.
[10128.97s -> 10130.81s]  Just for everyone to make sure they understand this.
[10131.53s -> 10139.27s]  This is crab nebula to me.
[10139.27s -> 10139.59s]  Why?
[10139.59s -> 10141.27s]  I just did like a loop-de-loop.
[10141.27s -> 10142.07s]  Why?
[10142.07s -> 10145.50s]  I'm going to fucking throw up here.
[10145.50s -> 10146.06s]  What's going on?
[10148.62s -> 10149.82s]  Where am I going?
[10149.82s -> 10160.31s]  Where am I going?
[10160.31s -> 10161.03s]  I don't understand.
[10161.03s -> 10162.63s]  Where am I going?
[10162.63s -> 10172.84s]  Oh, this is Beetlejuice 3 is the name of this planet.
[10172.84s -> 10173.88s]  Oh, god damn it.
[10173.88s -> 10174.52s]  No, no, no.
[10174.52s -> 10175.56s]  Not Beetlejuice 3.
[10181.99s -> 10183.83s]  Just wait for it any minute now.
[10188.36s -> 10189.88s]  It's not how many times you say it.
[10189.88s -> 10191.64s]  It's the planet number.
[10191.64s -> 10200.44s]  Hold on.
[10200.44s -> 10204.06s]  Where is he?
[10204.06s -> 10206.84s]  Where is he?
[10206.84s -> 10207.32s]  I don't...
[10209.62s -> 10210.90s]  I'm dying this music.
[10213.13s -> 10213.69s]  Is he here?
[10216.82s -> 10217.70s]  Where the fuck is he?
[10223.61s -> 10224.17s]  What the fuck?
[10224.17s -> 10224.81s]  Somebody at the door.
[10226.73s -> 10227.45s]  What the fuck?
[10228.09s -> 10229.13s]  Hold on.
[10229.13s -> 10262.46s]  Weirdly enough.
[10267.35s -> 10269.03s]  Weirdly enough, he drives for FedEx now.
[10270.41s -> 10272.41s]  I actually got a couple things on Amazon.
[10272.41s -> 10277.05s]  So put them over here.
[10277.05s -> 10282.81s]  I got to do water filter.
[10282.81s -> 10284.01s]  So that's cool.
[10288.33s -> 10296.60s]  Because the water in Vegas can be kind of not so good.
[10297.24s -> 10305.18s]  What was going on?
[10305.18s -> 10305.90s]  Oh, right, right, right.
[10305.90s -> 10306.46s]  We're going here.
[10312.73s -> 10313.77s]  Reused joke.
[10318.38s -> 10318.86s]  Come on.
[10319.82s -> 10320.94s]  That happened.
[10320.94s -> 10322.22s]  I got three.
[10322.22s -> 10322.62s]  Come on.
[10323.42s -> 10324.46s]  That actually happened.
[10324.46s -> 10325.42s]  He actually drove here.
[10326.87s -> 10330.79s]  Actually had an actual filter from the actual Beetlejuice
[10330.79s -> 10332.95s]  that actually showed up at my actual house.
[10338.25s -> 10339.45s]  Recycled water.
[10340.09s -> 10346.90s]  What is this thing?
[10346.90s -> 10348.10s]  An actual Beetlejuice.
[10350.94s -> 10355.34s]  Oh, is there a great wall?
[10355.34s -> 10356.06s]  What do you want me to do?
[10361.16s -> 10362.52s]  Should I go into locations?
[10368.46s -> 10370.22s]  One of the biggest stars known.
[10372.57s -> 10373.99s]  What is this one?
[10373.99s -> 10374.63s]  How big is it?
[10375.11s -> 10378.50s]  How many pounds is that?
[10382.14s -> 10384.70s]  Type in fuck and see if it gets any results.
[10391.38s -> 10392.66s]  Why would they ever do that?
[10395.56s -> 10397.24s]  No scientist is going to make.
[10398.46s -> 10399.18s]  Fuck.
[10399.18s -> 10403.35s]  I don't believe that for a second.
[10403.91s -> 10406.18s]  No, of course not.
[10411.27s -> 10412.23s]  I don't want to type it in.
[10425.70s -> 10430.54s]  I'm turning the game off so you can't see what I type next.
[10430.54s -> 10444.50s]  No, none of those exist.
[10444.50s -> 10463.98s]  None of these exist.
[10468.14s -> 10468.46s]  What is this thing?
[10468.46s -> 10469.74s]  This is the biggest object in the universe?
[10470.30s -> 10471.34s]  Something like that.
[10471.34s -> 10476.92s]  This is Starwo G64.
[10477.93s -> 10479.29s]  Go to the Pinwheel Galaxy.
[10484.31s -> 10485.11s]  Well, that was a...
[10485.11s -> 10486.31s]  I think you lied to me.
[10486.31s -> 10486.87s]  Pinwheel?
[10494.97s -> 10496.49s]  The Sloan Wall.
[10498.94s -> 10499.66s]  There's nothing...
[10499.66s -> 10500.46s]  There's nothing showing up.
[10501.26s -> 10501.58s]  This...
[10501.58s -> 10502.62s]  The wall?
[10503.34s -> 10504.76s]  What would it be called?
[10507.51s -> 10508.07s]  M1...
[10508.95s -> 10510.63s]  M101?
[10513.03s -> 10514.23s]  This M29?
[10515.58s -> 10520.22s]  Who keeps track of this shit?
[10520.22s -> 10522.62s]  If to be like an astronaut scientist person,
[10522.62s -> 10534.81s]  do you have to memorize all this shit?
[10534.81s -> 10537.59s]  Imagine needing to know all this.
[10537.59s -> 10539.11s]  So this is the biggest thing in the universe.
[10540.01s -> 10541.26s]  This here.
[10541.26s -> 10542.94s]  The M101.
[10542.94s -> 10546.17s]  It's called the computer.
[10546.17s -> 10549.88s]  Yeah, what about like 40 years ago?
[10549.88s -> 10551.08s]  30 to 40 years ago?
[10551.08s -> 10551.72s]  How did they keep track of...
[10551.72s -> 10553.24s]  They wrote it on notepads?
[10553.80s -> 10559.85s]  They had a book.
[10559.85s -> 10560.57s]  That's a big book.
[10561.13s -> 10567.03s]  They had computers.
[10567.03s -> 10567.91s]  Not powerful enough.
[10568.63s -> 10570.95s]  They had like fucking 100k worth of data.
[10570.95s -> 10573.59s]  That's not enough to store 500 trillion stars.
[10573.59s -> 10584.54s]  That's kind of cool looking.
[10587.46s -> 10588.74s]  Text is not heavy at all.
[10589.30s -> 10592.10s]  Yeah, but 500 trillion lines of text
[10592.10s -> 10594.50s]  is more than a computer in the 70s can handle.
[10596.30s -> 10598.46s]  This is actually called the pinwheel galaxy.
[10601.08s -> 10602.76s]  Well, maybe I should die in there.
[10607.93s -> 10609.37s]  So many things in here though.
[10609.37s -> 10610.73s]  Let's just pick a random one.
[10610.73s -> 10615.29s]  It looks super giant.
[10616.01s -> 10624.66s]  Do I feel like the guy that names stars
[10624.66s -> 10626.10s]  is the same guy that's so sick
[10626.10s -> 10628.66s]  of naming different colors of crayons or paints?
[10632.89s -> 10636.49s]  Yeah, we just found another 500 planets over here, Bill.
[10637.86s -> 10638.18s]  Shit.
[10638.74s -> 10645.56s]  Yeah, we really need names for them all.
[10645.56s -> 10650.41s]  That's cool though.
[10650.41s -> 10658.76s]  Where do we go?
[10658.76s -> 10659.40s]  What was it called?
[10659.40s -> 10659.96s]  I...
[10659.96s -> 10661.50s]  I see what?
[10661.50s -> 10662.86s]  I see 1001?
[10672.90s -> 10673.46s]  This is it?
[10678.44s -> 10681.08s]  I wouldn't be surprised, man, if this was an eyeball.
[10681.08s -> 10683.22s]  This was an eye.
[10683.78s -> 10702.01s]  What even is existence, by the way?
[10702.01s -> 10703.21s]  What the fuck is existence?
[10711.21s -> 10712.57s]  101...
[10712.57s -> 10714.09s]  1101.
[10714.09s -> 10729.56s]  I just wanted to laugh.
[10729.56s -> 10730.52s]  So this is it.
[10730.52s -> 10743.37s]  It's like foggy over here.
[10743.37s -> 10745.69s]  I see 1101.
[10745.69s -> 10754.63s]  Let's get in a little closer.
[10754.63s -> 10760.36s]  What's like right at the heart?
[10760.36s -> 10766.73s]  Is it weird that I think that if you get to the center of this,
[10766.73s -> 10768.25s]  you're gonna get superpowers.
[10768.25s -> 10773.00s]  That's how this works.
[10773.08s -> 10779.42s]  If you touch in the middle here, you turn into Superman.
[10779.42s -> 10780.30s]  How would that be?
[10780.30s -> 10781.18s]  It would be...
[10781.18s -> 10786.25s]  That's how that would work.
[10786.25s -> 10789.37s]  All you need to do is just breathe into your nostrils, the air here,
[10789.37s -> 10791.72s]  and you'll get the power of invisibility.
[10791.72s -> 10798.90s]  This is huge.
[10798.90s -> 10801.38s]  Hold on, what just zoomed by?
[10801.38s -> 10806.70s]  Star.
[10813.24s -> 10814.12s]  Radiation.
[10814.12s -> 10817.88s]  Yeah, but what if it's not radiation?
[10817.88s -> 10819.24s]  What if it's something else that we don't know?
[10819.80s -> 10821.24s]  What if everyone's just like,
[10821.24s -> 10823.08s]  ah, there's radiation in there, you're dead.
[10823.08s -> 10823.64s]  What if it's not?
[10823.64s -> 10826.31s]  What if it's like radiation?
[10826.31s -> 10827.38s]  I don't know.
[10827.38s -> 10828.10s]  What if it's something else?
[10828.10s -> 10829.46s]  What if it's like the other...
[10829.54s -> 10829.94s]  I don't know.
[10830.74s -> 10832.18s]  Nobody knows what's in here.
[10832.18s -> 10834.95s]  You don't know what the hell is in here.
[10834.95s -> 10836.15s]  Nobody knows what the fuck is in here.
[10844.31s -> 10844.71s]  What?
[10844.71s -> 10845.51s]  No, I'm serious.
[10845.51s -> 10848.23s]  Like, you don't know what's in the middle here.
[10848.23s -> 10860.30s]  Quick, say, Shmee.
[10860.30s -> 10869.54s]  I'm in the middle.
[10869.54s -> 10876.46s]  I'm in the center.
[10876.46s -> 10877.90s]  I have made it to the center.
[10886.89s -> 10887.85s]  I'm gonna try it.
[10887.85s -> 10896.34s]  Okay, here we go.
[10896.34s -> 10897.86s]  Fuck, it was muted.
[10897.86s -> 10899.45s]  Why was it muted?
[10899.45s -> 10900.73s]  Why would you be muted?
[10900.73s -> 10901.53s]  Why does every...
[10906.87s -> 10909.03s]  Why is YouTube permanently mute itself?
[10909.03s -> 10910.41s]  What feature is that?
[10910.41s -> 10916.94s]  What kind of dumb feature is that?
[10916.94s -> 10920.38s]  Hey, you know that website you just clicked on to want to watch a video?
[10920.38s -> 10927.22s]  We're gonna make sure it's muted when you click on it.
[10927.22s -> 10929.86s]  Why does YouTube always assume that I'm in like a dorm room
[10929.86s -> 10932.34s]  surrounded by like 10 people at like 4 o'clock in the morning
[10932.34s -> 10934.18s]  with speakers as loud as they can go?
[10938.26s -> 10940.39s]  What?
[10940.39s -> 10943.83s]  YouTube, I promise I'm not like in a fucking nursery
[10943.83s -> 10945.83s]  with the volume at max
[10945.83s -> 10948.15s]  with like a new Bose speaker system.
[10951.08s -> 10952.84s]  Why does every video have to be muted?
[10957.34s -> 10958.54s]  It doesn't have to be like this.
[10959.18s -> 10963.42s]  Everything is either muted or at maximum volume.
[10963.42s -> 10964.78s]  Just what is...
[10966.14s -> 10966.62s]  Why?
[10967.66s -> 10972.74s]  Bose is garbage?
[10972.74s -> 10973.54s]  What?
[10973.54s -> 10980.18s]  What do you mean, Bose is garbage?
[10980.18s -> 10990.78s]  What do you mean it is?
[10990.78s -> 10992.30s]  Where are you getting that information from?
[10992.30s -> 11000.58s]  Who told you that?
[11000.58s -> 11001.62s]  Holy shit, you guys.
[11004.06s -> 11008.30s]  You guys have strong opinions about Bose sound.
[11008.86s -> 11012.34s]  Whoa, where am I?
[11012.34s -> 11035.06s]  I made it.
[11035.06s -> 11037.51s]  I'm in the fucking center of all creation.
[11037.51s -> 11038.31s]  Let me try it.
[11041.02s -> 11041.98s]  I think that may have worked.
[11043.02s -> 11045.35s]  Oh, hold on.
[11045.35s -> 11047.93s]  Come in.
[11047.93s -> 11048.33s]  Just wait.
[11048.89s -> 11049.85s]  Wait a second.
[11073.99s -> 11075.75s]  Yeah, I'm running up the stairs.
[11075.75s -> 11076.39s]  Hey.
[11076.39s -> 11086.10s]  Sorry, I had another package.
[11086.10s -> 11089.10s]  I got a lot of deliveries.
[11089.10s -> 11091.74s]  Me and Beetlejuice, I like this.
[11091.74s -> 11103.26s]  This is a joke.
[11103.26s -> 11107.91s]  I was thinking about going and getting a package
[11107.91s -> 11109.11s]  and bringing it up here
[11109.11s -> 11113.26s]  because there's a package actually down there right now
[11113.26s -> 11115.59s]  but it has like all information on it
[11115.59s -> 11117.35s]  and I couldn't like...
[11117.35s -> 11119.62s]  I couldn't do it.
[11119.62s -> 11122.42s]  I would have to like have ripped off all the labels and shit
[11122.58s -> 11123.14s]  couldn't do it.
[11134.31s -> 11136.87s]  He had to drive back for another package.
[11142.22s -> 11143.26s]  Okay, so where are we?
[11143.82s -> 11144.62s]  Oh, ding dong.
[11144.62s -> 11145.42s]  Oh, that's funny.
[11145.42s -> 11158.01s]  Here we go.
[11158.01s -> 11158.97s]  iCar.
[11158.97s -> 11161.53s]  Wasn't I supposed to leave
[11161.53s -> 11163.50s]  till I go to the bathroom and come back
[11163.50s -> 11164.22s]  and do something else?
[11170.34s -> 11171.78s]  iCarly.
[11172.58s -> 11173.86s]  This is not an iCarly.
[11173.86s -> 11174.26s]  Wait, i...
[11175.14s -> 11182.73s]  Wait, hold on.
[11182.73s -> 11183.69s]  One, one, one.
[11183.69s -> 11185.85s]  There's a black hole in here.
[11191.64s -> 11192.36s]  So, shit.
[11193.00s -> 11195.16s]  Control G will take me to...
[11195.96s -> 11199.72s]  What's the name of the...
[11201.77s -> 11202.81s]  Okay, so I did Control G.
[11207.40s -> 11209.16s]  Go find Drake and Josh.
[11209.16s -> 11217.42s]  So I'm back in here.
[11217.42s -> 11219.80s]  But so, so what?
[11219.80s -> 11228.04s]  Am I inside of the damn thing?
[11228.04s -> 11228.52s]  Zoom out.
[11228.52s -> 11230.30s]  I'm trying to zoom out.
[11230.30s -> 11231.34s]  Holy shit.
[11232.73s -> 11235.48s]  Whoa, this is insanity.
[11235.48s -> 11236.36s]  That's awesome.
[11237.61s -> 11238.90s]  That's awesome.
[11238.90s -> 11239.54s]  Holy shit.
[11239.54s -> 11258.63s]  I gotta get a good pic of this one right here.
[11258.63s -> 11259.75s]  That's insane.
[11259.75s -> 11266.15s]  Remember all of this existed.
[11267.02s -> 11268.62s]  Yeah, that's wild.
[11268.62s -> 11269.43s]  That's what I'm saying.
[11269.43s -> 11270.71s]  Like how the fuck does this exist?
[11277.46s -> 11278.74s]  What the hell even is light?
[11279.75s -> 11281.03s]  Where does it come from?
[11281.03s -> 11290.52s]  You understand what I'm saying?
[11290.52s -> 11296.12s]  Where the hell does light even come from?
[11297.62s -> 11298.26s]  Photons.
[11298.26s -> 11300.26s]  What the fuck is a photon?
[11300.26s -> 11312.36s]  Like, I know it's energy,
[11312.36s -> 11314.12s]  but what even is energy?
[11314.12s -> 11317.64s]  What does that even mean?
[11317.64s -> 11319.40s]  Right now somebody's laughing at us.
[11319.40s -> 11321.00s]  Somebody's laughing at us right now.
[11321.00s -> 11322.58s]  Somebody has this on a computer screen,
[11322.58s -> 11327.21s]  like up fucking seven trillion light years away somewhere.
[11327.21s -> 11329.45s]  They're like, oh my god, they're laughing.
[11329.45s -> 11331.21s]  They're trying to figure out what light is over there
[11331.21s -> 11333.29s]  on that stupid shitty stream.
[11333.29s -> 11334.97s]  That guy's such a boomer.
[11334.97s -> 11339.05s]  Like they even use that terminology too.
[11342.02s -> 11349.30s]  I want to get a better picture right there.
[11349.30s -> 11352.63s]  It's going to hurt, but it's all right.
[11352.63s -> 11353.51s]  Drop this a little bit.
[11354.15s -> 11361.14s]  I'm going in.
[11361.14s -> 11366.44s]  I'm going in.
[11366.44s -> 11378.68s]  Why am I going backwards?
[11378.68s -> 11382.25s]  I'm going backwards.
[11382.25s -> 11383.21s]  Am I going backwards?
[11432.71s -> 11433.83s]  What the fuck is that?
[11435.43s -> 11440.01s]  Turn up the brightness.
[11440.01s -> 11444.74s]  Oh shit, I know how this movie ends.
[11444.74s -> 11446.02s]  For the rest of my existence,
[11446.02s -> 11451.03s]  I climb out of TVs and fucking call people,
[11451.03s -> 11452.63s]  collect from the bottom of the well.
[11452.63s -> 11465.05s]  How do I get out of here?
[11465.05s -> 11466.01s]  Head towards the light.
[11466.01s -> 11469.56s]  The light doesn't exist anymore.
[11469.56s -> 11470.68s]  What even is light?
[11470.68s -> 11474.25s]  What is, there's something else here.
[11474.25s -> 11479.90s]  I'm going.
[11479.90s -> 11483.06s]  I'm going.
[11483.06s -> 11507.06s]  I'm going.
[11507.06s -> 11508.36s]  Quick.
[11508.36s -> 11510.20s]  Someday somebody will develop these.
[11526.70s -> 11529.56s]  Did I make it out?
[11529.56s -> 11532.34s]  I made it out.
[11532.34s -> 11533.30s]  So what's on the other side?
[11533.30s -> 11533.86s]  Go again.
[11533.86s -> 11541.48s]  There's a Windows update error here.
[11541.48s -> 11542.44s]  Okay, hold on.
[11542.44s -> 11542.92s]  Black hole.
[11542.92s -> 11550.78s]  Go in.
[11550.78s -> 11551.42s]  Do it again.
[11551.42s -> 11553.72s]  Let's get the fuck in there.
[11553.72s -> 11557.30s]  Turn off the, turn that off.
[11557.30s -> 11560.25s]  And then I want to make this fast.
[11563.48s -> 11564.92s]  Oh fuck, I'm reversing time.
[11564.92s -> 11565.72s]  I just went through it.
[11566.46s -> 11566.86s]  All right.
[11566.86s -> 11568.46s]  I'm now in, I'm in no man's land now.
[11568.46s -> 11569.74s]  Now, this is important.
[11569.74s -> 11570.38s]  This is important.
[11570.38s -> 11570.94s]  I'm going to go down.
[11571.58s -> 11576.44s]  I want to go turn up the brightness.
[11577.24s -> 11577.88s]  Turn up the magnitude.
[11577.88s -> 11578.92s]  We're going to find out what's down here.
[11581.75s -> 11582.07s]  Okay.
[11582.07s -> 11596.34s]  I'm looking down and I'm going to go 500 trillion light years away until we hit.
[11596.34s -> 11597.46s]  What the fuck was that?
[11598.10s -> 11637.80s]  Wait, that's right.
[11637.80s -> 11642.70s]  Time doesn't exist in here.
[11643.34s -> 11644.38s]  I forgot about that.
[11645.82s -> 11647.10s]  There is no time.
[11647.10s -> 11649.64s]  There is only now.
[11649.64s -> 11665.69s]  I'm very comfortable right now.
[11680.26s -> 11680.76s]  Whoa.
[11682.47s -> 11682.97s]  Wow.
[11685.50s -> 11687.50s]  Literally fucking nothing could change.
[11688.97s -> 11691.40s]  My attention right now.
[11691.40s -> 11691.96s]  Holy shit.
[11691.96s -> 11693.08s]  This is fucking incredible.
[11696.44s -> 11699.00s]  Actually fucking one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.
[11699.00s -> 11703.30s]  I'm all right right now.
[11703.30s -> 11704.10s]  I don't need anything else.
[11704.98s -> 11705.62s]  Nothing else.
[11707.46s -> 11708.10s]  Oh, hold on.
[11712.74s -> 11714.26s]  Sometimes you got to go get a package.
[11717.78s -> 11718.10s]  Fuck it.
[11718.10s -> 11719.22s]  They'll leave it at the door.
[11719.22s -> 11721.16s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[11721.16s -> 11722.36s]  I need this right there.
[11722.36s -> 11722.84s]  No, no, no.
[11722.84s -> 11723.48s]  Do it again.
[11723.48s -> 11729.59s]  I want to get that again right when they, right here.
[11729.59s -> 11730.15s]  Ready?
[11730.15s -> 11733.72s]  Did I get it?
[11733.72s -> 11739.50s]  Need to sign for it?
[11739.50s -> 11741.66s]  No, they'll just like, they'll whip it as hard as they can at the front door.
[11746.70s -> 11766.28s]  Oh, I made it through.
[11766.28s -> 11766.68s]  I think.
[11770.04s -> 11770.36s]  Stop.
[11770.36s -> 11771.80s]  I just want to take a fucking picture.
[11772.52s -> 11776.71s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[11776.71s -> 11777.75s]  What was that?
[11777.75s -> 11783.21s]  No one's going to get one of these.
[11783.21s -> 11783.77s]  No one's going to get one.
[11783.77s -> 11784.41s]  I did.
[11784.41s -> 11804.34s]  It's the Borg.
[11805.22s -> 11811.43s]  Come on.
[11811.43s -> 11812.15s]  Let me get this.
[11815.69s -> 11816.33s]  No, no, no.
[11816.33s -> 11817.21s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11817.21s -> 11818.17s]  Right here.
[11818.17s -> 11838.81s]  It's a toilet.
[11844.41s -> 11844.89s]  Wow.
[11844.89s -> 11847.13s]  What a wonderful, beautiful black hole.
[11847.77s -> 11869.94s]  Really cool stuff.
[11870.58s -> 11874.52s]  I wonder what this actually is.
[11875.16s -> 11878.28s]  There's so much science as to what the heck is this even?
[11878.28s -> 11879.16s]  Is it energy?
[11879.16s -> 11880.44s]  Is it a time paradox?
[11881.30s -> 11882.58s]  Is it aliens?
[11882.58s -> 11883.70s]  Did aliens make this?
[11883.70s -> 11884.26s]  I don't know.
[11884.26s -> 11885.78s]  It's so many questions that I have.
[11886.50s -> 11888.22s]  We'll never know the answers to.
[11894.62s -> 11919.19s]  Now I'm stuck down here.
[11922.04s -> 11922.36s]  Great.
[11925.35s -> 11927.59s]  I've got to, I'm stuck down here.
[11927.59s -> 11928.39s]  Can anybody help me?
[11928.39s -> 11929.43s]  Is there anybody that can help me?
[11930.47s -> 11930.95s]  Oh, hold on.
[11932.31s -> 11932.79s]  Somebody.
[11936.07s -> 11937.59s]  Somebody got to somebody's bearing a plumber.
[11952.26s -> 11952.90s]  No, almost.
[11954.09s -> 11955.05s]  You got to do more than that.
[11956.38s -> 11957.02s]  A little more.
[11958.46s -> 11959.90s]  We're still stuck down here, man.
[11963.32s -> 11963.80s]  Help us.
[11964.70s -> 11972.65s]  Preview, preview, preview, preview.
[11979.50s -> 11980.86s]  That wasn't even a plunger.
[11980.86s -> 11981.98s]  What the fuck was that?
[11982.70s -> 11984.38s]  We're still stuck down here and we need help.
[11984.70s -> 11987.26s]  What do you recommend is the quickest and easiest way
[11987.26s -> 11988.30s]  to unclog a drain?
[11990.22s -> 11990.70s]  I don't know.
[11990.70s -> 11991.58s]  If your sink is clogged like this,
[11991.58s -> 11993.26s]  you're definitely looking for the quickest
[11993.26s -> 11995.58s]  and easiest way to get it unclogged
[11995.58s -> 11997.98s]  and the over-the-counter drain cleaners work most
[11997.98s -> 12000.06s]  of the time, but they can be a little damaging
[12000.06s -> 12001.02s]  to your pipes.
[12001.02s -> 12002.22s]  Before you try that.
[12002.22s -> 12002.86s]  Yeah.
[12002.86s -> 12005.98s]  This is a drain snake and it has a brush
[12005.98s -> 12007.82s]  or sometimes several hooks on the end.
[12007.82s -> 12008.38s]  Well, be careful.
[12008.38s -> 12008.94s]  We're down here.
[12008.94s -> 12010.62s]  To reach down and grab.
[12010.62s -> 12011.34s]  Easy, easy.
[12011.34s -> 12014.46s]  To be clogging up your sink, particularly in a bathroom.
[12014.46s -> 12016.38s]  But if you have a lot of grease and food,
[12016.38s -> 12017.90s]  you need a little pressure
[12017.90s -> 12020.54s]  and everybody has one of these very, very effective.
[12020.54s -> 12020.86s]  What is it?
[12020.86s -> 12021.90s]  Oh, is that a plunger?
[12021.90s -> 12022.54s]  I can't see.
[12022.54s -> 12024.22s]  But if you have a double sink like this,
[12024.22s -> 12026.14s]  you want to make sure you take your stopper
[12026.14s -> 12028.46s]  on the open side of the sink.
[12028.46s -> 12028.78s]  Where is he?
[12028.78s -> 12030.30s]  He's coming this way.
[12030.30s -> 12033.34s]  That'll put more pressure on the side of the plunger
[12033.34s -> 12034.94s]  and then that'll be very successful
[12034.94s -> 12035.90s]  in blowing through.
[12035.90s -> 12036.94s]  That wasn't enough.
[12036.94s -> 12037.66s]  That wasn't enough.
[12037.66s -> 12038.62s]  Follow that up.
[12038.62s -> 12039.74s]  Plenty of hot water.
[12039.74s -> 12040.54s]  Sorry, Dave.
[12040.54s -> 12041.18s]  That wasn't enough.
[12043.75s -> 12044.39s]  God damn it.
[12045.35s -> 12047.14s]  You're going to need something more powerful than that.
[12052.87s -> 12063.26s]  Come on, almost there.
[12072.26s -> 12072.90s]  You got it.
[12072.90s -> 12073.22s]  Thanks.
[12073.94s -> 12075.99s]  All it took is a vacuum to stuff it down the drain.
[12075.99s -> 12077.43s]  By the way, if you ever have a drain,
[12077.43s -> 12078.79s]  if you have a clogged toilet or something,
[12080.38s -> 12081.90s]  just get the vacuum attachment.
[12082.78s -> 12084.38s]  Stuff it down into the toilet bowl,
[12085.02s -> 12085.66s]  into the drain,
[12085.66s -> 12087.74s]  turn it on and suck up whatever it is in the vacuum.
[12093.30s -> 12096.26s]  Now, one of you psychos is going to do that
[12096.26s -> 12097.86s]  and I have to make sure I say
[12097.86s -> 12098.90s]  that that is not a joke.
[12098.90s -> 12099.70s]  I hope you do that
[12101.40s -> 12102.12s]  because it works.
[12108.41s -> 12109.61s]  Do not do that.
[12110.82s -> 12112.66s]  I'm not going to be responsible
[12112.66s -> 12114.98s]  for your fucking YouTube prank video
[12114.98s -> 12116.66s]  that you put up online and say,
[12116.66s -> 12118.66s]  hey, Jeremy said this.
[12118.66s -> 12131.66s]  This is so crazy.
[12132.22s -> 12135.56s]  All right.
[12135.56s -> 12137.48s]  I think we saw all we need to see in this game.
[12137.48s -> 12138.12s]  Is there anything else?
[12143.48s -> 12149.24s]  Any other cool, any cool other nucleuses?
[12151.50s -> 12152.86s]  Zoom out all the way.
[12152.86s -> 12154.06s]  Oh, yeah, right, right, right, right, right.
[12154.06s -> 12154.62s]  I was going to do that.
[12154.62s -> 12155.50s]  I was going to run away.
[12157.38s -> 12157.86s]  Where am I?
[12163.64s -> 12164.12s]  There we go.
[12164.12s -> 12168.23s]  Okay, let's turn down the magnitude here.
[12168.23s -> 12169.91s]  It's a little much for me.
[12170.79s -> 12177.64s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[12177.64s -> 12179.48s]  Put black hole quality on low.
[12179.48s -> 12180.76s]  Put black hole quality on low.
[12180.76s -> 12181.80s]  Black hole quality on low.
[12181.80s -> 12182.36s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[12182.36s -> 12184.84s]  Wait, wait, wait, where, where, where?
[12184.84s -> 12187.14s]  G, control G.
[12188.41s -> 12189.05s]  What was it called?
[12191.77s -> 12192.65s]  What was it?
[12192.65s -> 12197.96s]  Black hole quality on low.
[12197.96s -> 12199.64s]  Look up IC dash.
[12199.64s -> 12200.04s]  Shut up.
[12209.91s -> 12210.63s]  All right, hold on.
[12210.63s -> 12211.35s]  I'm going to go pee.
[12212.15s -> 12216.18s]  I'll be right back.
[12216.18s -> 12216.74s]  I'm going to pee.
[12421.91s -> 12422.95s]  Are you guys fucking kidding me?
[12424.23s -> 12424.55s]  Really?
[12425.75s -> 12426.07s]  Really?
[12427.51s -> 12428.31s]  All right, nice.
[12432.15s -> 12435.43s]  I come back and people are just putting minuses into the chat.
[12436.15s -> 12454.81s]  Is this tug of war or is this a barometer for how the jokes are?
[12454.81s -> 12455.85s]  It's because I left.
[12457.00s -> 12457.72s]  I'm coming back.
[12459.58s -> 12462.46s]  All right, what do you guys want me to turn on?
[12462.46s -> 12467.03s]  A quality low, right?
[12467.59s -> 12471.42s]  A black hole quality on low.
[12472.14s -> 12474.20s]  Why is it two mediums?
[12474.20s -> 12474.92s]  Oh, never mind.
[12475.48s -> 12478.68s]  Black hole quality on low and then go to a black hole.
[12479.40s -> 12480.02s]  All right.
[12480.58s -> 12483.02s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
[12483.02s -> 12483.90s]  Yeah, I changed it.
[12483.90s -> 12484.54s]  I know.
[12484.54s -> 12485.10s]  Come on.
[12485.10s -> 12488.46s]  I live in one part of the earth that cares about this and this.
[12489.26s -> 12495.10s]  All right, so where's the black hole?
[12496.57s -> 12498.25s]  What's a cool black hole that you know of?
[12498.81s -> 12503.56s]  Because after this, we're going to move on to something else.
[12508.68s -> 12510.36s]  Go inside a black hole.
[12515.22s -> 12516.42s]  For a second, I really almost
[12518.39s -> 12519.35s]  like typed that in.
[12521.24s -> 12522.52s]  Not because somebody just wrote it.
[12522.52s -> 12523.96s]  I was like, oh, wait, no, that's a song.
[12529.85s -> 12530.49s]  Which one of these?
[12533.83s -> 12534.31s]  X1.
[12539.35s -> 12541.11s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[12541.11s -> 12542.15s]  What what's going on here?
[12542.15s -> 12542.55s]  Why is this?
[12545.91s -> 12546.55s]  Why is it on?
[12547.77s -> 12548.65s]  Okay, all right.
[12548.65s -> 12548.97s]  This is...
[12549.77s -> 12567.46s]  Why did that happen?
[12567.46s -> 12572.38s]  Oh, this thing has like flames on it.
[12589.67s -> 12590.95s]  Is this a black hole?
[12590.95s -> 12593.53s]  This is not a black hole though.
[12593.53s -> 12595.05s]  I'm looking for a black hole.
[12595.05s -> 12612.38s]  Right, is the other one is a black hole.
[12612.38s -> 12613.34s]  This is a black hole.
[12614.46s -> 12618.81s]  Don't look like a black hole
[12618.93s -> 12625.53s]  Hold on slow down slow down. What are you thinking here times 30?
[12626.21s -> 12636.68s]  Slow down the speed. Let's get a closer look here. It looks like a butane torch
[12637.26s -> 12647.97s]  All right. Why do I feel like this is going like a million miles per hour? This is a regular speed
[12648.67s -> 12709.62s]  Slow down. I mean I where do you well abstract now do normal speed
[12709.62s -> 12719.17s]  I'm gonna warn you this is probably gonna hurt. This is not gonna be pretty to look at here
[12719.25s -> 12723.37s]  Just be aware of this despite this this could be a little over stimulating
[12723.37s -> 12726.49s]  Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that because this is gonna be a time is one speed
[12727.01s -> 12729.34s]  Yeah, just be this is gonna be super stimulating
[12729.82s -> 12798.56s]  Shit, what did I what the fuck? I'm trying to just go in backwards, but it's hard to line up. I slow down slow down
[12799.12s -> 12832.05s]  That's it. I get I'm zoomed out as far as I can in theory. You would see the back of your head
[12832.23s -> 12857.76s]  Let's go the other way. What happens if you go the other way in a black hole? No wrong same thing
[12857.76s -> 12871.80s]  Yeah, same thing happens. Well, that was cool. You get out. Do you though you're dead by the radiation?
[12871.80s -> 12875.66s]  We don't know this radiation there 3c 58
[12877.98s -> 12884.82s]  I just took I just took like an actual screenshot. I think 3c
[12885.87s -> 12891.38s]  58 3c
[12891.42s -> 12915.10s]  66 B. Let's see what this one's like. Yeah, it's a run-of-the-mill galaxy. No, yeah
[12923.05s -> 12934.74s]  FoV down. I mean, this is like the normal fov the bubble nebula now
[12934.94s -> 12958.38s]  Hold on. We'll do something else. Just relax. Just relax. I see why. Yep. Okay, do Sagittarius a didn't we already do?
[12958.38s -> 12969.53s]  Sagittarius a yeah, we already did Sagittarius a I was here before I mean we didn't see the ion cannon that was coming
[12969.53s -> 12988.94s]  Out of it. I don't think it wasn't this pronounced was it this is insane
[12989.42s -> 13005.98s]  Do a time-lapse doesn't have an orb. What is this an orbit of now you get tangled in that
[13006.22s -> 13012.35s]  You'd get tangled up in there. Oh, that's cuz of the black hole. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait
[13012.63s -> 13036.56s]  Wow, that's so cool. They all just ran the fuck into each other. What is the trajectory of this?
[13036.56s -> 13040.72s]  I want to see what is that trajectory? What's going up there?
[13041.12s -> 13052.79s]  What's that and why is that doing that if there's a black hole down here and it's all the gravity is getting like
[13053.43s -> 13058.23s]  What's this guy flying around for?
[13063.71s -> 13072.05s]  S111 that's so strange. What that's such a weird pattern
[13072.41s -> 13082.76s]  It goes up here and then just rides the rollercoaster down and does the same thing again. No, no, no, wait
[13082.76s -> 13088.18s]  Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, come back. Come back. Come back. Wait. Wait, what it's what come back come back
[13088.40s -> 13105.37s]  We reversed it just don't give a fuck come back here. What year is it?
[13107.83s -> 13137.37s]  8400 the year 8400 where'd it go? Where'd it go? Where the fuck did it go? I did okay
[13137.37s -> 13152.22s]  I did this stick this it disappeared on me. Let's go. Take a look. Oh, this is like
[13152.74s -> 13154.62s]  600
[13154.62s -> 13156.54s]  Quatrillion light years away
[13156.54s -> 13177.64s]  Really what I'm on it, right G. Yeah G double G tap G go to object G
[13177.64s -> 13188.42s]  I'm I press G like five times. Are you like I'm not pressing G. They're like won't let me go over here
[13188.92s -> 13199.66s]  This is freaking me out. Hold on. See I can't go any faster. I have to like go there
[13200.30s -> 13212.78s]  What is happening? Yeah, look at this. It won't let me go over here
[13212.98s -> 13219.00s]  It stops me right here and spins me around. All right, I'm gonna have it come backwards then
[13219.44s -> 13231.23s]  Did we find a new planet? I think we found a new planet. I know nobody knows about this only we do reverse time
[13231.75s -> 13266.35s]  Pull it back. What I want to go to s1 1 1 1 is that the
[13266.87s -> 13278.71s]  Let me move out of the way. I think they might be broken. It might be broken. Yeah, I might come on
[13278.79s -> 13285.46s]  Is that it? I'm so confused right now. What is this line?
[13286.02s -> 13307.76s]  The line is even bending. I'm just gonna get right in the way. Okay, so
[13308.28s -> 13339.99s]  Let's go. Where is it? Get over here. Is it the black hole is fucking it up. The hell is this doing?
[13340.43s -> 13366.51s]  Well, oh well, I tried it's insane. Oh
[13372.38s -> 13387.84s]  Come on make a milkshake. It's pulling me back. Stop pulling me back. Just center G
[13388.24s -> 13414.55s]  It's going so fast that they all froze. All right, normal normal. It's time
[13415.35s -> 13440.02s]  You guys ready? I'm going this way for 10 straight seconds. Go to ID 10 T for black hole
[13440.42s -> 13464.97s]  Did you just spell out idiot? I think you did. Yeah, you did. That's idiot. That's that's pretty good
[13465.09s -> 13471.88s]  I'll give you that one. That was pretty good. All right, you ready? So we are distance 12
[13472.28s -> 13479.64s]  The gala the universe cannot be infinite. There's definitely like a brick wall that you walk into there has to be an end
[13480.16s -> 13494.54s]  Nothing is infinite. There's an end. I made it. I did I'm here. I made it
[13495.56s -> 13499.09s]  I told you I told you there's gonna be like a fucking wall here. That's the end
[13499.29s -> 13525.11s]  But what does it look like from far away all the way back? I'm gonna laugh my ass off if it's a gnome
[13539.01s -> 13540.59s]  31
[13540.59s -> 13549.62s]  Gly now we're in darkness. Wait one here. What is that?
[13549.98s -> 13559.16s]  Let's find the I need the one red dot here and then I'm gonna move on. This is galaxy RG
[13559.44s -> 13561.44s]  wall 0 1 6
[13561.84s -> 13563.84s]  1 8 8
[13564.36s -> 13571.17s]  8 up the magnitude. I mean I'm at I'm at like almost a magnitude limit
[13571.73s -> 13586.53s]  No, I'm not how far can this go? I mean am I gonna try to break the computer?
[13586.93s -> 13593.48s]  Let's pull back and see what it is
[13593.48s -> 13602.69s]  What's the image? Come on my computer hurts
[13603.13s -> 13624.77s]  Pull it back and have it say something like the treasure's buried at this precise location. So that's what it looks like
[13628.42s -> 13635.14s]  This is this is somebody with like a sunburn. We're just a goddamn skin cell all of us
[13635.54s -> 13685.68s]  Pull it down pull it down pull it down pull it universe Sandbox universe. I'll do universe Sandbox
[13685.68s -> 13690.65s]  All right, let's play a fun game
[13690.65s -> 13697.09s]  So let's spin it around and wherever I land with my face and my finger is where I'm gonna go on vacation
[13697.77s -> 13700.61s]  Let's see. Oh my god. I hope it's Hawaii
[13705.18s -> 13712.07s]  I just choked on my water. What the fuck?
[13722.44s -> 13741.57s]  There it is it's this galaxy double G Oh
[13741.61s -> 13743.73s]  Oh
[13743.73s -> 13753.29s]  Shit the the limit. I just blew a firework up in my face
[13753.47s -> 13767.95s]  What a great disposable camera picture by the way got the firework exploding again. It's over. Yeah, that's it
[13767.95s -> 13783.94s]  We got we got the wheel of death space engine has stopped responding close the program. Okay, that was interesting
[13784.82s -> 13789.02s]  Imagine being a science teacher and unloading that up during class
[13789.42s -> 13798.40s]  We didn't get that shit. The guy had a chalkboard and drew
[13798.88s -> 13807.45s]  Shitty planets in this like crusty white paste and his handwriting sucked
[13809.73s -> 13822.38s]  Imagine we had that shit god. That would have been awesome. I would have been so much more into school
[13822.82s -> 13834.35s]  Think about how much more fun and cool school would have been. I was so disinterested in high school
[13843.90s -> 13848.54s]  All right, so we have like
[13849.78s -> 13852.21s]  a couple hours hour or two I
[13852.53s -> 13859.47s]  Bought and I have downloaded. There's a couple of things that I thought would be might be fun. I have received various
[13861.04s -> 13868.63s]  Recommendations and we're gonna do a poll. We'll do a poll on the screen here in a minute
[13868.63s -> 13875.54s]  I don't know I know about one of these but I do not know about the other one
[13875.78s -> 13879.34s]  So I'm gonna mispronounce this
[13880.14s -> 13887.67s]  Very very poorly because I don't know how to pronounce. I don't it's this one is called
[13888.63s -> 13897.98s]  Recetteer and item shops tail and the other one is cook serve delicious of the two that were
[13898.42s -> 13904.36s]  Requested that I thought might have been interesting. I also have cook serve delicious, too
[13904.62s -> 13914.70s]  Now I don't know there might be some internal debates here by the chatters
[13915.32s -> 13929.72s]  Both are so good. I have played cook serve delicious before I don't know if I should just open cook serve delicious, too
[13930.08s -> 13943.50s]  Is this a scenario where cook serve delicious to is just a better version of cook serve delicious one do it
[13943.70s -> 13951.38s]  We'll do do what cook serve delicious to is worse
[13951.84s -> 13957.72s]  Well, I'll put a poll on the screen here because we'll vote on that too. So straw poll
[13958.48s -> 13963.45s]  So let me give you an indicator of what's going on over the next few weeks. I
[13964.95s -> 13971.11s]  Want to do so obviously tomorrow. I'm probably gonna do Mario maker 2 tomorrow and just played random levels and
[13971.59s -> 13976.34s]  Fuck around for like, you know a few hours, however long I can take it
[13977.34s -> 13983.42s]  Saturday is the grain screen movie night on core stream and then on top of that
[13984.20s -> 13989.17s]  Next week. I want to I think I want to do Dark Souls randomizer
[13989.69s -> 13992.63s]  At least try that once or twice
[13993.05s -> 13996.97s]  randomized items randomized enemies and stuff looked like it was
[13997.97s -> 13999.97s]  Just I can't say words
[14000.37s -> 14002.37s]  but
[14002.53s -> 14011.05s]  Yeah, I can oh, huh. All right, hold on
[14011.61s -> 14014.69s]  I'm gonna just write on a bucket of an item shops tail
[14015.29s -> 14019.62s]  Is an item shops tail like its own stream?
[14020.10s -> 14026.77s]  Cuz I can kind of just play cook serve delicious for like a couple hours and we can just chill and talk about stuff
[14026.77s -> 14028.77s]  Cuz I didn't want to also bring up
[14028.77s -> 14030.77s]  we're kind of just
[14030.97s -> 14033.05s]  rolling here, so I didn't want to bring up the
[14034.22s -> 14038.14s]  Cuz at least two options are needed. There are two options. Oh
[14038.78s -> 14050.75s]  Okay, so the first option the cook serve delicious
[14051.23s -> 14059.14s]  That's just if you want to see that rather than an item shop still we will pick the first of the second one
[14059.14s -> 14063.38s]  I might even just open the first one. You know what I mean vote on that
[14063.38s -> 14066.54s]  I'm gonna put the BRB screen up and drop in a shitload of frames to
[14068.92s -> 14072.63s]  I don't know why this shit was fixed
[14073.11s -> 14074.87s]  But apparently not
[14074.87s -> 14079.23s]  Hopefully this is kind of like an outlier today because that's a lot of drop frames. I
[14079.79s -> 14093.38s]  Don't have time for reciter. It's its own stream. Is that true?
[14094.14s -> 14096.14s]  it's not just like a little
[14096.90s -> 14098.90s]  cook serve delicious is
[14098.98s -> 14119.18s]  More inclined to what we're doing right now. Does it really take that long? Huh? It's gigantic. Oh geez. All right, um
[14120.18s -> 14126.69s]  Well, okay. Hold on riddle me this riddle me this right? Let me ask you this
[14127.33s -> 14132.64s]  Would you want me to just do that tomorrow instead of Mario maker 2 and we'll do Mario maker 2 next week
[14133.26s -> 14148.50s]  Doesn't take that long. Yeah, but I really only I mean, I'm probably only gonna stream for like another couple hours. So
[14150.50s -> 14160.73s]  Absolutely not never play Mario maker. Well, we'll see how it goes. I'm gonna play it. Yeah, I guess I'll strike while the iron saw it
[14160.73s -> 14166.53s]  Yeah, all right. All right. Hey, listen, I know you just voted on a poll and I'm going to pretend like that poll never happened
[14167.53s -> 14168.99s]  so
[14168.99s -> 14173.03s]  Sorry, I will play that item shop game
[14173.81s -> 14176.57s]  Next week before we do Dark Souls remastered
[14177.37s -> 14178.45s]  randomizer
[14178.45s -> 14191.27s]  So you can expect that that can that's kind of what we'll do next week. What a democracy. What a great democracy. We got here
[14191.79s -> 14193.89s]  but the streamer just
[14193.89s -> 14201.81s]  Reverses everything he just said but let's open up a cook serve delicious and we'll do Mario maker tomorrow
[14201.81s -> 14207.56s]  Cuz that's like that's like a hot game. I mean I gotta play the hot game. Hopefully this is not loud
[14207.56s -> 14215.57s]  I can't believe you asked us. Well, I I thought that cooks
[14215.57s -> 14220.33s]  I thought that that item shop game was like and a good thing I you can probably hear it
[14220.41s -> 14241.93s]  I can't even change that you're trying to stay relevant by playing Mario maker
[14242.45s -> 14249.30s]  What do you what are you on about here? I gotta turn this way the fuck down. This is so loud
