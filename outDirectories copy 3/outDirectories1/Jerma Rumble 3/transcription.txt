[0.31s -> 24.90s]  It's the end of a year, and the beginning of a new adventure. Welcome everyone, to Turma Rumble 3. Excitement, awe, and inspiring motions will get you on your feet tonight, I can promise you that.
[24.90s -> 33.90s]  But before we get started, please join me in a moment of silence to remember all those wrestlers who we lost this past year.
[33.90s -> 103.39s]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise and welcome Grandpa to sing our national anthem.
[103.39s -> 118.81s]  Oh, say can you see, by the drop of my smokey, my poor meatball, bursting in air, bursting in air.
[118.81s -> 119.81s]  Turn on my mic!
[119.81s -> 126.81s]  Turn my mic on! Grandpa! Oh no, that's Demon Lord Zaraxos, ladies and gentlemen. I can't even, he's got a chocolate!
[126.81s -> 131.81s]  Whoa! He just did, just fire underneath that ring.
[131.81s -> 141.98s]  Okay, um, hey everybody, welcome to Turma Rumble 3. I'm Turma. While I try to compose myself after what just happened, Sonic the Hedgehog is now coming down to the ring.
[141.98s -> 146.54s]  He's supposed to come in 16th. What the fuck is going on?
[146.54s -> 154.78s]  I'm gonna have to do some jumbling around of the scheduler and see who's coming in next, but anyways, visibly drunk and spitting at people in the audience is Sonic the Hedgehog.
[154.78s -> 162.78s]  Look, we get it. We know Sonic Boom wasn't a good success. We know that Germania 2014, you lost, but that is no excuse for this type of behavior.
[162.78s -> 168.78s]  Get your act together. Please ring that bell. Let's start Turma Rumble 3. My god.
[168.78s -> 174.40s]  No, he's uh, he's dead.
[174.40s -> 178.40s]  Uh, that's the second person Zaraxos has killed in two minutes.
[179.64s -> 187.64s]  And, uh, I carried the button. We started, guys. We have started two or three minutes ago, so that means another contestant has to come down to the arena.
[187.64s -> 194.64s]  And we'll get this guy introduced as quickly as possible. This is Turtimus the Adolescent Warrior, and he's got a task ahead of him.
[194.64s -> 199.64s]  If he's going to be number three, that's gonna die, and he's gonna show off for the cameras a little bit here.
[199.64s -> 206.64s]  If he is number three to die in a row by Demon Lord Zaraxos, I really don't know what to say. I'm not exactly sure how we're going to continue the rumble,
[206.64s -> 213.64s]  but Turtimus, if Master Splintoad has taught you anything at all, please use it immediately.
[213.64s -> 219.65s]  Because it would be bad if Demon Lord Zaraxos just eliminated himself.
[219.65s -> 222.96s]  Why? What? What?
[222.96s -> 226.61s]  I have no idea why that just happened.
[226.61s -> 232.61s]  But regardless, we have to send another person in prematurely, so whoever is next on the list, send them on out here.
[232.61s -> 240.91s]  And it's gonna be, ladies and gentlemen, it's a good one, it's the 1997 Boston Celtics Champion, Frank Pizza,
[240.91s -> 246.91s]  running down here with his patented, I have a dump in my pants run. Here he comes, and let's get started.
[246.91s -> 250.91s]  Welcome to actual wrestlers in the ring now.
[250.91s -> 257.91s]  We're going to actually talk about technical rasslin', rather than people just instantly dying when they come into the ring.
[257.91s -> 262.91s]  Turtimus, the teenage adolescent mutant warrior, or whatever, what did I call him? Something like that.
[262.91s -> 268.91s]  And Frank Pizza of the Boston Celtics, wearing his 1997 authentic championship jersey.
[268.91s -> 273.91s]  Turtimus was looking for a early elimination there, but cannot even get him over the first turnbuckle.
[273.91s -> 279.91s]  Well, Frank Pizza's now hanging on the ice, reverse elbow, and a flying shoulder tackle onto Turtimus for his troubles.
[279.91s -> 284.91s]  But Frank Pizza gets his leg caught, gets spun around on his back, and here comes another contestant.
[284.91s -> 292.09s]  If you forget how this works, every minute or so, another competitor is going to come down, and here comes a familiar face indeed.
[292.09s -> 299.09s]  You had to have thought that after Captain Crunch's victory at Germania 2014, we'd see more serial characters.
[299.09s -> 303.46s]  And here's Count Chocula, coming down to the German arena for the first time ever.
[303.46s -> 308.87s]  And unfortunately, his serial leg doesn't even exist anymore.
[308.87s -> 314.11s]  You can only get Count Chocula on Halloween. That's how much this guy sucks.
[314.11s -> 317.11s]  But he's in the German Rumble for the first time ever.
[317.11s -> 322.48s]  Let's see if he's got any tricks up his sleeve, besides, of course, turning your milk into chocolate milk.
[322.48s -> 327.48s]  And it's not even really chocolate milk. It's like a weird inside of a dog's ass chocolate milk.
[327.48s -> 330.48s]  It tastes like it's just like sugar. It's all right.
[330.48s -> 336.48s]  Look, I'm not going to blast Count Chocula, because I used to eat it every other day when I was a kid.
[336.48s -> 342.48s]  I'd eat Captain Crunch. I'd eat Count Chocula. I'd eat like Boo Berry. All these old cereals.
[342.48s -> 345.48s]  I ate them all when I was younger, so I can't be biased against any of them.
[345.48s -> 348.48s]  But we got another contestant coming in right now.
[348.48s -> 353.91s]  Confidently walking down to the arena is everybody's favorite shit character.
[353.91s -> 358.98s]  It is none other than Gabe, the Glueman Dick Rossi.
[358.98s -> 360.98s]  Fireworks. I don't know why he bought fireworks.
[360.98s -> 363.98s]  He spent like 60 bucks for no reason, because nobody cares.
[363.98s -> 368.35s]  Nobody cares about you, Glueman. Just get in here and win for fucking once in your life.
[368.35s -> 371.35s]  Four people in the arena. Now we get Glueman, Captain Crunch.
[371.35s -> 374.35s]  Oh, I almost just said Captain Crunch. That's Count Chocula. Get your cereals right.
[374.35s -> 378.35s]  That's Count Chocula, Glueman, Frank Pizza, and Turtimus the Teenage Warrior.
[378.35s -> 382.35s]  No eliminations whatsoever. Not yet, at least.
[382.35s -> 385.77s]  And pay attention to the left side of your screen right now.
[385.77s -> 390.77s]  Gabe, the Glueman Dick Rossi, and Frank Pizza, former teammates on the Celtics, are fighting right now for some reason.
[390.77s -> 395.77s]  Turtimus is gone. Turtimus has just been eliminated from the competition by Count Chocula.
[395.77s -> 398.77s]  And Glueman now. Glueman looks like he just got in.
[398.77s -> 401.77s]  That would be a terribly sad story if Frank Pizza and Count Chocula try to help.
[401.77s -> 404.77s]  He doesn't really...Count Chocula didn't do anything there, let's be honest.
[404.77s -> 407.77s]  Are they actually going to try to double-team Glueman out of here?
[407.77s -> 412.46s]  Another person coming down to the arena right now. Who's it going to be while they're tag-teaming Glueman?
[412.46s -> 416.02s]  That's Dick Dastardly Richard from the Rat Movie.
[416.02s -> 419.02s]  One of the most notorious gem thieves and artifact stealers.
[419.02s -> 423.02s]  This side of the Mississippi, folks. This is a dangerous man.
[423.02s -> 428.02s]  Keep your eye on him for the remainder of the Rumble, because frankly, he is terrifying.
[428.02s -> 429.70s]  And here he comes.
[429.70s -> 433.52s]  Surprisingly a lot bigger than I thought he was going to be.
[433.52s -> 435.52s]  I thought he was only going to be, like, five-five.
[435.52s -> 437.70s]  He's a...but how big is Count Chocula?
[437.70s -> 440.13s]  Isn't Count Chocula, like, three feet tall?
[440.13s -> 443.43s]  Well, no, Glueman's, like, six-something, I think, right? I have no idea.
[443.43s -> 446.43s]  All I know is that Frank Pizza just gave Glueman three or four punches,
[446.43s -> 452.43s]  and Glueman accidentally just slobber-knocked Count Chocula in the face.
[452.43s -> 454.43s]  He was going for Frank Pizza, but he ended up getting...
[454.43s -> 458.43s]  Well, then, Frank Pizza now gets a chin smash into a hip toss
[458.43s -> 461.43s]  and then into a flipping heel kick onto Frank Pizza.
[461.43s -> 464.43s]  Count Chocula is doing some work here.
[464.43s -> 467.43s]  Count Chocula and Glueman doing their respective work.
[467.43s -> 470.43s]  Frank Pizza looks like he could be on the verge here of getting eliminated.
[470.43s -> 472.43s]  So does Dick Dastardly Richard. No, gets the punch.
[472.43s -> 475.43s]  Is Captain Cork-Cocula...Cork-Cocula gets it. I said his name wrong.
[475.43s -> 479.43s]  Frank Pizza is now eliminated with a drop kick to his face over the ropes.
[479.43s -> 482.43s]  And we've got another contestant coming down to the arena.
[482.43s -> 485.43s]  It's the Candyman from Lethal League.
[485.43s -> 488.43s]  If you've never played Lethal League, in my opinion,
[488.43s -> 491.43s]  it is one of the best indie games of 2014.
[491.43s -> 494.43s]  I suggest you check it out. He is represented here for the first time ever.
[494.43s -> 496.43s]  Welcome, Candyman.
[496.43s -> 499.43s]  Without his cane that he typically uses,
[499.43s -> 502.43s]  and immediately goes for Dick Dastardly Richard, who throws him over the ropes.
[502.43s -> 505.43s]  Dick, could he immediately get eliminated for his first appearance in the German arena?
[505.43s -> 511.80s]  No. Dick Dastardly Richard with a very rare sign of empathy and sympathy there,
[511.80s -> 513.80s]  letting him get up. You don't technically see that ever by Dick.
[513.80s -> 515.80s]  And he could really suffer because of that.
[515.80s -> 517.80s]  He just gave him a little bit of sympathy.
[517.80s -> 519.80s]  You don't give that kind of sympathy to the Candyman.
[519.80s -> 521.80s]  Is Dick Dastardly Richard going out Candyman?
[521.80s -> 523.80s]  Cork-Cocula, how many fucking times am I going to miss?
[523.80s -> 525.80s]  For now, it's Cork-Cocula's name.
[525.80s -> 529.80s]  And just barely, just barely, he gets up.
[529.80s -> 531.80s]  Dick Dastardly Richard survives another day.
[531.80s -> 533.80s]  But is he going to, right after surviving that,
[533.80s -> 535.80s]  he's going to go, oh, we've got another contestant coming in right now.
[535.80s -> 537.80s]  And Dick Dastardly Richard vines.
[537.80s -> 539.80s]  I can't, I'm going to fucking change that name.
[539.80s -> 541.80s]  And here comes the Giant Rat.
[541.80s -> 543.80s]  That's the Giant Rat rolling his way down here.
[543.80s -> 545.80s]  Look at him go.
[545.80s -> 547.80s]  I've never seen such a huge rat in my entire life.
[547.80s -> 549.80s]  He definitely prays at night.
[549.80s -> 551.80s]  He definitely stalks at night.
[551.80s -> 553.80s]  You can tell by just by the way he looks.
[553.80s -> 555.80s]  And he's in the arena right now as Glooman is about to get,
[555.80s -> 557.80s]  he's going right by, what a ball dog by the Giant Rat.
[557.80s -> 559.80s]  And he is, me means business.
[559.80s -> 561.80s]  You've got to figure, he's definitely a top seed.
[561.80s -> 563.80s]  Ladies and gentlemen, if I were to say so myself,
[563.80s -> 567.80s]  the Giant Rat is now in along with Dick Dastardly Richard,
[567.80s -> 569.80s]  which makes it, no, he's gone.
[569.80s -> 571.80s]  Dick Richard is gone.
[571.80s -> 573.80s]  He has been eliminated.
[573.80s -> 575.80s]  Well, the Giant Rat and Count Chocula are trying to push Glooman out.
[575.80s -> 577.80s]  Are they going to Glock?
[577.80s -> 579.80s]  Glooman has been eliminated.
[579.80s -> 581.80s]  Glooman is out of the competition
[581.80s -> 583.80s]  per use of the Giant Rat
[583.80s -> 585.80s]  and Count Chocula.
[585.80s -> 587.80s]  What a terrible thing to see.
[587.80s -> 589.80s]  And we've got another person coming out almost immediately already.
[589.80s -> 591.80s]  It's crazy to me
[591.80s -> 593.80s]  how fast people come out in this game.
[593.80s -> 595.80s]  Has it really been like 30 to 60 seconds?
[595.80s -> 597.80s]  I feel like somebody just came in.
[597.80s -> 599.80s]  But whatever, sorry, because it's Earthworm Jim
[599.80s -> 601.80s]  showing off his dance moves.
[601.80s -> 603.80s]  He's ready, he's a veteran of the German Rumbles
[603.80s -> 605.80s]  and he's here to prove himself.
[605.80s -> 607.80s]  He's here to dance. He's here to point.
[607.80s -> 609.80s]  And he's here to win.
[609.80s -> 611.80s]  Welcome Earthworm Jim to the rumble.
[611.80s -> 613.80s]  As we've got Count Chocula patiently awaiting his arrival
[613.80s -> 615.80s]  while the Giant Rat and Candy Man are fighting in their own right.
[615.80s -> 617.80s]  And Earthworm Jim, right when he gets in,
[617.80s -> 619.80s]  does a headbutt to Count Chocula's stomach.
[619.80s -> 621.80s]  Would that even hurt?
[621.80s -> 623.98s]  Isn't Earthworm Jim a worm?
[623.98s -> 625.98s]  Is there any bones? I don't think worms don't even have any bones, do they?
[625.98s -> 628.15s]  So I don't know why.
[628.15s -> 630.15s]  That would just kind of feel like squishy goo
[630.15s -> 632.15s]  pushing up against your stomach.
[632.15s -> 634.15s]  Anyways, we've got Count Chocula already.
[634.15s -> 636.15s]  Count Chocula just eliminated Earthworm Jim
[636.15s -> 638.15s]  with a clothesline over the top ropes.
[638.15s -> 640.15s]  Immediately when he gets in.
[640.15s -> 642.15s]  Oh, I had high hopes for you, Earthworm Jim.
[642.15s -> 644.15s]  Every time you get screwed.
[644.15s -> 646.15s]  And Candy Man, speaking of people getting screwed,
[646.15s -> 648.15s]  Candy Man now looks like he can, no, he's going to stay in.
[648.15s -> 650.15s]  He is going to get rid of that double team
[650.15s -> 652.15s]  while we have another person coming in.
[652.15s -> 654.15s]  He just throws over the giant rat, which is surprising
[654.15s -> 656.15s]  because he is a top seed.
[656.15s -> 658.15s]  Count Chocula lining up the big boot!
[658.15s -> 660.33s]  And he's gone! And here comes the mime!
[660.33s -> 663.58s]  You know, every Jerma Rumble
[663.58s -> 665.58s]  we visit a thing where
[665.58s -> 667.58s]  he's the shit character.
[667.58s -> 669.58s]  You know how there's always the worst character
[669.58s -> 671.58s]  that's made? This is the one.
[671.58s -> 673.82s]  But here he comes, he jumps over the top ropes.
[673.82s -> 675.82s]  There are only three people in the
[675.82s -> 677.82s]  ring at the moment. You've got Count Chocula,
[677.82s -> 680.31s]  Candy Man, and now the mime. What's that?
[680.31s -> 684.07s]  Are you serious?
[684.07s -> 686.07s]  As I'm getting word right now, we're going to be joined
[686.07s -> 688.07s]  at ringside right now
[688.07s -> 690.07s]  by Demon Lord Zaraxos at the commentary table.
[690.07s -> 692.31s]  Okay, I don't know.
[692.31s -> 694.55s]  Okay.
[694.55s -> 696.55s]  We're going to have to get another seed over here so we can move
[696.55s -> 698.55s]  a couple things while the action
[698.55s -> 700.55s]  is still going on. I want to be able to still cast the game.
[700.55s -> 702.55s]  But ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
[702.55s -> 704.55s]  Demon Lord Zaraxos.
[704.55s -> 706.55s]  Once you have a seat, we pulled a chair up here for you.
[706.55s -> 708.55s]  Please tell us what's on your mind,
[708.55s -> 710.73s]  I guess.
[710.73s -> 712.73s]  Man, I was fucking bored back there.
[712.73s -> 714.73s]  Alright, I don't want to cut you off,
[714.73s -> 716.73s]  but we do have another entrant to come in, Demon Lord.
[716.73s -> 718.73s]  It is a 90's icon.
[718.73s -> 720.73s]  You know him as the Slim Jim Guy.
[720.73s -> 722.73s]  Snap into a Slim Jim, oh yeah,
[722.73s -> 724.73s]  baby. Here he is.
[724.73s -> 726.73s]  Making his first ever appearance. The Slim Jim Guy is in this?
[726.73s -> 729.61s]  Yeah.
[729.61s -> 731.61s]  I hate this guy.
[731.61s -> 733.61s]  I've had a feud with this guy for the last like
[733.61s -> 735.91s]  2,000 years.
[735.91s -> 737.91s]  You've had a feud with the Slim Jim Guy for
[737.91s -> 739.91s]  two... That doesn't make any... I'm going to move on.
[739.91s -> 741.91s]  So, we have Slim Jim Guy
[741.91s -> 743.91s]  coming in. You really threw me off there, dude.
[743.91s -> 745.91s]  We have Slim Jim Guy coming in. We have the Mime,
[745.91s -> 747.91s]  Count Chocula, and Candyman
[747.91s -> 749.91s]  now, all fighting for
[749.91s -> 751.91s]  dominance in Jerma Rumble 3. Welcome, Slim Jim Guy.
[751.91s -> 753.91s]  And I guess while I have you
[753.91s -> 755.91s]  here, Zaraxos, I do have a couple of questions for you.
[755.91s -> 757.91s]  I'll get to those in a minute, but I do want to
[757.91s -> 759.91s]  focus on what's going on in the ring. We've got Slim Jim
[759.91s -> 761.91s]  now on the ropes, and a backhanded
[761.91s -> 763.91s]  slap to Candyman,
[763.91s -> 765.91s]  who is calling for time out right now
[765.91s -> 767.91s]  for some reason. People tend to do that.
[767.91s -> 769.91s]  Why do people call for time out in the middle
[769.91s -> 771.91s]  of a Royal Rumble? You're not going to get it.
[771.91s -> 773.91s]  There is no time out. What do you think there's a referee here?
[773.91s -> 775.91s]  And there goes Candyman! No, just barely.
[775.91s -> 777.91s]  Count Chocula almost eliminates him while
[777.91s -> 780.28s]  we have another contestant coming out. This
[780.28s -> 782.28s]  guy does not need an introduction.
[782.28s -> 784.28s]  He's the most miserable person on Earth.
[784.28s -> 786.28s]  Miserable, Mikey. And he's
[786.28s -> 788.28s]  all the way from the Quizney Channel, the most
[788.28s -> 790.28s]  miserable place on Earth. And
[790.28s -> 792.28s]  here he is, to show that he's ready
[792.28s -> 794.28s]  to take on everybody in the Jerma
[794.28s -> 796.52s]  Arena. He's huge, by the way. He's
[796.52s -> 798.82s]  like another giant rat. Anyways, now we're getting
[798.82s -> 800.82s]  a little crowded here as he goes for
[800.82s -> 802.82s]  Count Chocula with a couple of swift elbows
[802.82s -> 804.82s]  to his face. Nearly takes
[804.82s -> 806.82s]  his skull off, his huge skull,
[806.82s -> 809.00s]  mind you. And now that we have sort of a second
[809.00s -> 811.00s]  here where I can ask you, Xeraxos, I have
[811.00s -> 813.00s]  one question, just one simple question.
[813.00s -> 815.00s]  What the hell was going on in the beginning
[815.00s -> 817.00s]  there? Why did you eliminate yourself?
[817.00s -> 819.00s]  What are you doing? You honestly think
[819.00s -> 821.30s]  I belong here? It just wasn't fair.
[821.30s -> 823.48s]  You're going to put like Candyman and
[823.48s -> 825.48s]  Count Chocula versus me?
[825.48s -> 827.48s]  I'm the lord of all hells. None of
[827.48s -> 829.48s]  these little dipshits can do anything against me.
[829.48s -> 831.48s]  Why would I be in it? God, I fucking
[831.48s -> 833.48s]  hate the Slim Jim guy. You need to
[833.48s -> 835.48s]  calm down. Okay, you're seriously stressing
[835.48s -> 837.48s]  me out. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. So we got another entrance
[837.48s -> 839.48s]  to do, guys. Another buzzer. That means number 12
[839.48s -> 841.48s]  is going to be coming in. And it's
[841.48s -> 843.48s]  you know him. You love him.
[843.48s -> 845.66s]  The egg is coming down
[845.66s -> 847.96s]  for the fourth time. You know,
[847.96s -> 849.96s]  I am actually, I hate to say this,
[849.96s -> 851.96s]  but I actually am pleasantly surprised to see the egg.
[851.96s -> 854.26s]  I thought he was going to die or something. I thought he
[854.26s -> 856.26s]  would be one of the people in the beginning that was dead.
[856.26s -> 858.26s]  But no, he ends up being here. And
[858.26s -> 860.26s]  hopefully he goes far because he always
[860.26s -> 862.26s]  loses. So welcome egg to the German Rumble
[862.26s -> 864.26s]  and we've got a lot of stuff going on. Candyman
[864.26s -> 866.26s]  now is owing the ropes. He may
[866.26s -> 868.26s]  in fact, no, not going to get eliminated by Miserable Mikey.
[868.26s -> 870.26s]  I can't get over the fact that the
[870.26s -> 872.26s]  Slim Jim guy is in this. Will you
[872.26s -> 874.63s]  stop? I'm pissing me off. You need to stop
[874.63s -> 876.63s]  interrupting me. Okay, you're really derailing this
[876.63s -> 878.63s]  whole thing. I'm going back in. Fuck this guy. No, no, no, no.
[878.63s -> 880.63s]  You can't do that. Fucking Slim Jim guy. Zaraxos
[880.63s -> 882.63s]  no. Zaraxos.
[882.63s -> 884.63s]  Oh no, no, no, no. Don't do it.
[884.63s -> 887.06s]  Don't do it. No, we're going to get.
[887.06s -> 889.06s]  All right, get security. Get security.
[889.06s -> 891.06s]  Somebody call the fire department. Call security.
[891.06s -> 893.06s]  No, what do the Mayan have to do with
[893.06s -> 895.06s]  this? I'm not going to have this asshole
[895.06s -> 897.06s]  rule the whole German Rumble. There's another person dead.
[897.06s -> 899.06s]  Zaraxos is killing everybody in the
[899.06s -> 901.06s]  ring. Candyman, no. No, he's going
[901.06s -> 903.06s]  down. We need some help. The egg.
[903.06s -> 905.06s]  What the fuck egg? No, no, count Chocula.
[905.06s -> 907.06s]  All right, we need to get like the army
[907.06s -> 909.06s]  or something. How do you deal with the demon lord?
[909.06s -> 911.06s]  I have no idea. But somebody
[911.06s -> 913.06s]  has to get down there. Somebody has to stop this.
[913.06s -> 915.06s]  The egg and Mickey Mouse are
[915.06s -> 917.06s]  really starting. They're plotting who's
[917.06s -> 919.06s]  going to take on. You're not going to be able to take him on.
[919.06s -> 921.06s]  Are you crazy? I don't know what to do.
[921.06s -> 923.06s]  We're going to have to cancel the whole event, guys. I'm really
[923.06s -> 925.06s]  sorry about this. But wait a minute.
[925.06s -> 927.06s]  Who is that? Is that who
[927.06s -> 929.30s]  I think it is? That's Mr. Sneak Man.
[929.30s -> 931.30s]  It's me, Mr. Sneak Man.
[931.30s -> 933.30s]  Oh no.
[933.30s -> 935.30s]  No.
[935.30s -> 937.30s]  He came and he was trying to rescue this
[937.30s -> 939.30s]  event and he got stopped by
[939.30s -> 941.30s]  Demon Lord Zaraxos. This is just ridiculous
[941.30s -> 943.30s]  guys. And now Demon Lord can do whatever he
[943.30s -> 945.30s]  wants now. He cleared the ring pretty much.
[945.30s -> 947.30s]  And hold on a second.
[947.30s -> 949.30s]  Hold on a second.
[949.30s -> 951.30s]  Kitty, he's going to do it.
[951.30s -> 953.30s]  Through the table. Mr. Sneak Man
[953.30s -> 955.30s]  has just eliminated Demon Lord Zaraxos
[955.30s -> 957.30s]  and himself in the process.
[957.30s -> 959.30s]  Oh my God.
[959.30s -> 961.30s]  What have we just witnessed?
[961.30s -> 963.30s]  And also Bat Boy is, who fucking
[963.30s -> 965.30s]  cares about this guy? This guy sucks.
[965.30s -> 967.30s]  What really matters is Mr.
[967.30s -> 969.30s]  Sneak Man saves the
[969.30s -> 971.30s]  day and lets the rumble continue
[971.30s -> 973.30s]  sacrificing himself
[973.30s -> 975.30s]  for the greater good.
[975.30s -> 977.30s]  Thank you Mr. Sneak Man. Your
[977.30s -> 979.80s]  duty will not go unnoticed.
[979.80s -> 981.80s]  It seems like Zaraxos is very slow
[981.80s -> 983.80s]  to get up here. Needing the attention
[983.80s -> 985.80s]  of medical staff to bring him out.
[985.80s -> 987.98s]  I think he might have broken his leg on
[987.98s -> 990.15s]  that table. Yeah, he's pointing at his leg here.
[990.15s -> 992.15s]  Let's hope he does not recover
[992.15s -> 994.15s]  because fuck this guy. He ruined the whole rumble.
[994.15s -> 996.58s]  And after that entire ordeal
[996.58s -> 998.58s]  we are left with just three
[998.58s -> 1000.58s]  competitors in the ring and what a shame
[1000.58s -> 1002.76s]  it is that it's these three
[1002.76s -> 1004.94s]  guys. You're telling me you couldn't have
[1004.94s -> 1006.94s]  chokeslammed Miserable Mikey into hell?
[1006.94s -> 1009.11s]  Like what is he still doing here?
[1009.11s -> 1011.11s]  You picked Count Chocula. He was doing
[1011.11s -> 1013.11s]  fantastic. Why would, now there's like three
[1013.11s -> 1015.11s]  dickheads in the ring. And now they're gonna
[1015.11s -> 1017.11s]  be double teaming. Now they're gonna do Miserable Mikey
[1017.11s -> 1019.11s]  holding the egg back while Bat Boy punches
[1019.11s -> 1021.11s]  him in the stomach and calling for time
[1021.11s -> 1023.11s]  out. It doesn't work. Stop calling time out.
[1023.11s -> 1025.11s]  It doesn't do it. Now Bat Boy is being held back by
[1025.11s -> 1027.11s]  the egg. These guys are idiots.
[1027.11s -> 1029.11s]  And now here comes the king
[1029.11s -> 1031.11s]  of all the idiots.
[1031.11s -> 1033.11s]  Ladies and gentlemen, please put your
[1033.11s -> 1035.11s]  hands together for the greatest
[1035.11s -> 1037.11s]  video game character to ever live.
[1037.11s -> 1039.11s]  I'm talking about Pac-Man.
[1039.11s -> 1041.11s]  Here he comes.
[1041.11s -> 1043.11s]  Coming in at number 14
[1043.11s -> 1045.11s]  to Jerma Rumble 3. And he's
[1045.11s -> 1047.11s]  got a great advantage. If you come in
[1047.11s -> 1049.11s]  in the last five or six you have such
[1049.11s -> 1051.11s]  a huge one up on
[1051.11s -> 1053.11s]  every other competitor that has come in
[1053.11s -> 1055.11s]  so far. He's refreshed.
[1055.11s -> 1057.11s]  He's naked and he's ready to go.
[1057.11s -> 1059.29s]  And his first order of business is to throw
[1059.29s -> 1061.29s]  Mikey over the ropes.
[1061.29s -> 1063.29s]  Not necessarily going for any
[1063.29s -> 1065.29s]  elimination while Bat Boy just did a roundhouse
[1065.29s -> 1067.29s]  kick and completely missed the egg.
[1067.29s -> 1069.29s]  I don't know if anybody saw that but I'm sure you did.
[1069.29s -> 1071.29s]  What a block by Pac-Man. One punch
[1071.29s -> 1073.29s]  and here comes the second. What a blast
[1073.29s -> 1075.29s]  to his face knocking him clean unconscious
[1075.29s -> 1077.29s]  while the egg is gonna get thrown over.
[1077.29s -> 1079.29s]  The egg has been eliminated by Bat
[1079.29s -> 1081.29s]  Boy. Embarrassing egg
[1081.29s -> 1083.29s]  hit the showers. You just got eliminated
[1083.29s -> 1085.29s]  by Bat Boy. And speaking of eliminations
[1085.29s -> 1087.29s]  we've got potentially Mikey
[1087.29s -> 1089.29s]  going over here by Pac-Man and Bat Boy. Is he gonna
[1089.29s -> 1091.29s]  go over? There holding up by his butt cheeks
[1091.29s -> 1093.29s]  and he doesn't go over just
[1093.29s -> 1095.29s]  barely. And here comes number 15.
[1095.29s -> 1097.46s]  All the way from your
[1097.46s -> 1099.46s]  neighborhood classroom. He's
[1099.46s -> 1101.46s]  here. He's primed. He's ready.
[1101.46s -> 1103.46s]  He's sharpened. He is.
[1103.46s -> 1106.09s]  The pencil.
[1106.09s -> 1108.26s]  First time ever seeing him in the
[1108.26s -> 1110.26s]  Jerma arena making his way down
[1110.26s -> 1112.26s]  really confident. He is stoked
[1112.26s -> 1114.26s]  to be here. He said he sharpened
[1114.26s -> 1116.26s]  his head to the point where he could stab
[1116.26s -> 1118.26s]  somebody through the heart and instantly
[1118.26s -> 1120.26s]  kill them. Let's hope he doesn't do that because that
[1120.26s -> 1122.26s]  would be terrible and we don't want to see any
[1122.26s -> 1124.26s]  more characters die at the hands
[1124.26s -> 1126.26s]  of somebody in this arena tonight.
[1126.26s -> 1128.26s]  Well Pac-Man gets a Larry by Mikey. Pac-Man has
[1128.26s -> 1130.50s]  been eliminated. And
[1130.50s -> 1132.50s]  look at this temper tantrum. He's starting to throw
[1132.50s -> 1134.50s]  at ringside right now. Usually a
[1134.50s -> 1136.50s]  pretty happy-go-lucky guy. Not
[1136.50s -> 1138.50s]  tonight though. Unfortunately
[1138.50s -> 1140.50s]  Pac-Man you have to go home. I
[1140.50s -> 1142.50s]  don't even know where that is. And the pencil
[1142.50s -> 1144.50s]  could get eliminated as well. No pencil
[1144.50s -> 1146.50s]  still hangs on to a double
[1146.50s -> 1148.50s]  attempt at elimination.
[1148.50s -> 1151.05s]  And now it's back to three.
[1151.05s -> 1153.05s]  There has been three in the ring
[1153.05s -> 1155.05s]  for the last few minutes now. We have not
[1155.05s -> 1157.05s]  seen a crowded ring since Zaraxos
[1157.05s -> 1159.05s]  destroyed everyone.
[1159.05s -> 1161.05s]  But now we've got number 16
[1161.05s -> 1163.05s]  coming in while Batboy is just
[1163.05s -> 1165.05s]  looking back and forth like he's at a tennis match.
[1165.05s -> 1167.74s]  I'm not exactly sure what the hell he's doing.
[1167.74s -> 1170.04s]  And that's, that's Jerma.
[1170.04s -> 1173.35s]  Looks a little different. Has he lost
[1173.35s -> 1175.85s]  weight? Has he not been going to the gym?
[1175.85s -> 1178.54s]  I don't know. Does he?
[1178.54s -> 1180.54s]  Oh no. Here we go. Let's see a couple of push-ups by you Jerma.
[1180.54s -> 1182.54s]  Let's show everybody you can do them.
[1182.54s -> 1185.02s]  You did one. You did one. Okay.
[1185.02s -> 1187.32s]  Very good. Get in the ring.
[1187.32s -> 1189.32s]  Batboy is still just looking left and right
[1189.32s -> 1191.32s]  while Mikey is being pushed over the
[1191.32s -> 1193.32s]  ropes by the pencil. Is he gonna get it?
[1193.32s -> 1195.32s]  He's gonna get it! He just tossed Mikey
[1195.32s -> 1197.32s]  over. That's it. Mikey is gone. He was in there
[1197.32s -> 1199.32s]  for a little while. He survived. The
[1199.32s -> 1201.50s]  final survivor of the Zaraxos
[1201.50s -> 1203.50s]  Tyrade has been eliminated.
[1203.50s -> 1205.80s]  And pay attention to these guys
[1205.80s -> 1207.80s]  that are in here right now everybody
[1207.80s -> 1209.80s]  because these three have a huge
[1209.80s -> 1211.80s]  percentage chance to win
[1211.80s -> 1213.80s]  the Jerma Rumble. There are only four
[1213.80s -> 1215.80s]  other contestants physically that are
[1215.80s -> 1217.80s]  going to come in and what a toss
[1217.80s -> 1219.80s]  by Batboy on the pencil.
[1219.80s -> 1221.80s]  I gotta say, we have seen some pretty
[1221.80s -> 1223.80s]  impressive moves by Batboy today.
[1223.80s -> 1225.80s]  I have talked a lot of shit about this guy
[1225.80s -> 1227.80s]  but he has done very well
[1227.80s -> 1229.80s]  with his time in the ring so far.
[1229.80s -> 1231.80s]  And what a block. What a reverse block by pencil
[1231.80s -> 1233.80s]  and a punch to the face by Jerma. Could we see Jerma get
[1233.80s -> 1235.80s]  eliminated? No, he reverses it and
[1235.80s -> 1237.80s]  tosses pencil into the corner there while we have
[1237.80s -> 1239.80s]  another person coming in at
[1239.80s -> 1242.10s]  number 17. Take a look
[1242.10s -> 1244.41s]  at this guy. Do you see the
[1244.41s -> 1246.41s]  intensity on that face? You can breathe
[1246.41s -> 1248.41s]  in the determination. He's looking for
[1248.41s -> 1250.41s]  redemption. Can you hear that roar?
[1250.41s -> 1252.41s]  That's Gabe Newell. Gabe
[1252.41s -> 1254.41s]  Newell is here at number 17.
[1254.41s -> 1256.41s]  The sailor of the ship.
[1256.41s -> 1258.41s]  The queen of Valve. The king of
[1258.41s -> 1260.41s]  Valve. He is everything. He is one.
[1260.41s -> 1262.41s]  He is the only Gabe Newell.
[1262.41s -> 1264.41s]  And you gotta figure shit is gonna hit
[1264.41s -> 1266.41s]  the fan when he gets in the ring here. He is
[1266.41s -> 1268.41s]  not happy with Jerma. What a duck by Jerma.
[1268.41s -> 1270.41s]  Gets him in a German suplex and throws him.
[1270.41s -> 1272.41s]  Unbelievable reversal there by Jerma.
[1272.41s -> 1274.41s]  Here comes the grudge match. TF2
[1274.41s -> 1276.41s]  community versus Valve. All the
[1276.41s -> 1278.41s]  shit that we talked about end of the line. It got
[1278.41s -> 1280.41s]  to Gabe Newell. He's pissed about it. What a punch.
[1280.41s -> 1282.41s]  And one, two, three. What
[1282.41s -> 1284.41s]  a series of combinations. Gabe Newell has
[1284.41s -> 1286.41s]  a vendetta and he is just
[1286.41s -> 1288.41s]  taking it out on Jerma's face right now.
[1288.41s -> 1290.41s]  Another right hand. Oh no he gets
[1290.41s -> 1292.41s]  a block. Gets a reversal here. Jerma going
[1292.41s -> 1294.41s]  for a wrist twist. It's not gonna happen.
[1294.41s -> 1296.41s]  Gabe Newell is running on pure adrenaline
[1296.41s -> 1298.41s]  right now. Tosses Jerma over the ropes.
[1298.41s -> 1300.41s]  Are we gonna see an elimination? Gabe
[1300.41s -> 1302.41s]  Newell is going to eliminate Jerma.
[1302.41s -> 1304.41s]  He's gone. Gabe Newell is cheering
[1304.41s -> 1306.41s]  into the crowd right now of his elimination
[1306.41s -> 1308.41s]  of Jerma. And we have another person
[1308.41s -> 1310.41s]  to call in. What a series of
[1310.41s -> 1312.41s]  events that just was.
[1312.41s -> 1314.41s]  I seriously can't believe
[1314.41s -> 1316.41s]  that Gabe Newell just came in and kicked the
[1316.41s -> 1318.65s]  shit out of me. Like he went right
[1318.65s -> 1320.65s]  for me. I didn't program that.
[1320.65s -> 1322.65s]  That like happened. He just beat the absolute bag
[1322.65s -> 1324.65s]  out of me and then threw me out.
[1324.65s -> 1326.65s]  I didn't script that. Anyways
[1326.65s -> 1328.65s]  here comes Abierre. And he's gonna go
[1328.65s -> 1330.65s]  right for Gabe Newell. Gabe Newell spins him around
[1330.65s -> 1332.65s]  and slams him on his back while the pencil
[1332.65s -> 1334.65s]  almost falls out of the ring
[1334.65s -> 1336.65s]  after being tossed over by Batboy
[1336.65s -> 1338.65s]  who still I can't believe is in it.
[1338.65s -> 1340.65s]  I cannot believe this. Guys
[1340.65s -> 1342.65s]  Batboy's like median attributes
[1342.65s -> 1344.65s]  are like 13 out of 100.
[1344.65s -> 1346.65s]  His like strength and grappling
[1346.65s -> 1348.65s]  and dexterity and all that shit
[1348.65s -> 1350.65s]  is less than 20 for every single one.
[1350.65s -> 1352.65s]  He should have been eliminated a long
[1352.65s -> 1354.65s]  time ago, but he's still in it for some reason.
[1354.65s -> 1356.65s]  Hey, maybe not for long.
[1356.65s -> 1358.65s]  Pencil's got him on the corner. You're gonna possibly throw him
[1358.65s -> 1360.65s]  over. No!
[1360.65s -> 1362.65s]  He gets a hand in the mouth right into
[1362.65s -> 1364.65s]  what is, what is Abierre doing?
[1364.65s -> 1366.65s]  What the hell is that? He was just like making origami
[1366.65s -> 1368.65s]  in front of him. He wasn't even like touching him.
[1368.65s -> 1370.65s]  And here comes number 18.
[1370.65s -> 1372.65s]  Sorry.
[1372.65s -> 1374.65s]  You didn't think there was gonna be
[1374.65s -> 1376.65s]  any more serial characters
[1376.65s -> 1378.65s]  did you? You didn't think that Sonny
[1378.65s -> 1380.65s]  the Cocoa Puffs Bird was gonna make an
[1380.65s -> 1382.65s]  appearance at number 19 in the
[1382.65s -> 1384.65s]  Jerma Rumble. Here he is. Sonny.
[1384.65s -> 1386.65s]  He's Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs
[1386.65s -> 1388.65s]  and he's Cuckoo for the audience too. Look at him
[1388.65s -> 1390.65s]  riling him up, pointing and shouting. Everyone's
[1390.65s -> 1392.65s]  getting so fired up from Cuckoo the Cocoa Puffs
[1392.65s -> 1394.65s]  Sonny the Bird. And now he's in the ring
[1394.65s -> 1396.65s]  diving over with a beautiful display. They're going
[1396.65s -> 1398.65s]  right for Batboy. Strangely
[1398.65s -> 1400.65s]  enough, why did he go right for Batboy?
[1400.65s -> 1402.65s]  Batboy and Gabe Newell were in
[1402.65s -> 1404.65s]  sort of a little tussle there, but he
[1404.65s -> 1406.65s]  he may have been listening to me backstage.
[1406.65s -> 1408.65s]  There's a monitor back there. He just definitely
[1408.65s -> 1410.65s]  heard me talking about his low attributes
[1410.65s -> 1412.65s]  and he's gonna go, he's gonna take this to his advantage.
[1412.65s -> 1414.65s]  He's gonna push over Batboy. Is Sonny the Bird gonna do it?
[1414.65s -> 1416.65s]  Sonny the Bird's gonna toss him. He tosses
[1416.65s -> 1418.65s]  him. That's it. Batboy has been eliminated.
[1418.65s -> 1420.65s]  Sonny using
[1420.65s -> 1422.65s]  insider trading to be
[1422.65s -> 1424.65s]  able to throw Batboy over
[1424.65s -> 1426.65s]  the ropes there, which is sort of unfortunate
[1426.65s -> 1428.65s]  for Batboy because he went far. And now
[1428.65s -> 1430.65s]  Sonny is sort of just standing around not doing
[1430.65s -> 1432.65s]  anything. He went for the easy route
[1432.65s -> 1434.65s]  and now he's just chilling out while we have another
[1434.65s -> 1436.65s]  competitor coming in. This is the final
[1436.65s -> 1438.65s]  competitor, the final person in
[1438.65s -> 1442.04s]  JermaRumble 3 is
[1442.04s -> 1444.04s]  it's Tony the Tiger!
[1444.04s -> 1446.04s]  Do you hear this crowd right now?
[1446.04s -> 1448.04s]  This is the loudest I've ever heard
[1448.04s -> 1450.04s]  the Germania crowd screaming for
[1450.04s -> 1452.04s]  Tony the Tiger, the most physically
[1452.04s -> 1454.04s]  fit, the most positively influenceable,
[1454.04s -> 1456.04s]  the best serial character in
[1456.04s -> 1458.04s]  a lot of people's opinions. Here he comes
[1458.04s -> 1460.04s]  for the first time ever, Tony the Tiger
[1460.04s -> 1462.04s]  rounding out the number 20 spot.
[1462.04s -> 1464.04s]  Finally, the last person is
[1464.04s -> 1466.04s]  in and one of these
[1466.04s -> 1468.04s]  five is going to be crowned
[1468.04s -> 1470.04s]  JermaRumble 3 champion.
[1470.04s -> 1472.04s]  And there is a high chance
[1472.04s -> 1474.04s]  it's gonna be another serial
[1474.04s -> 1476.04s]  character. So place
[1476.04s -> 1478.04s]  your bets now. Somebody in
[1478.04s -> 1480.04s]  this ring is going to win.
[1480.04s -> 1482.04s]  Will it be the much deserved
[1482.04s -> 1484.04s]  Gabe Newell victory that we've all
[1484.04s -> 1486.04s]  been waiting for? Could it be a revival
[1486.04s -> 1488.04s]  of the Biaz? Could the Biaz
[1488.04s -> 1490.04s]  take it? Could Gabe Newell just clothesline
[1490.04s -> 1492.04s]  Sonny the Bird over the top ropes? Yes he will!
[1492.04s -> 1494.04s]  See you later, Sonny!
[1494.04s -> 1496.04s]  And now there are four.
[1496.04s -> 1498.04s]  You see, this is where fatigue,
[1498.04s -> 1500.04s]  this is where the nerves, this is where the
[1500.04s -> 1502.04s]  computer AI, which one isn't a moron,
[1502.04s -> 1504.04s]  this, all this stuff comes into play
[1504.04s -> 1506.04s]  at the very end of a JermaRumble.
[1506.04s -> 1508.04s]  You see we've got the Bia now and Gabe Newell in the
[1508.04s -> 1510.04s]  corner, two very heavy characters.
[1510.04s -> 1512.04s]  The Bia and Gabe Newell,
[1512.04s -> 1514.04s]  very large characters. Gabe Newell with ease
[1514.04s -> 1516.04s]  seems to pick up the Bia on the top
[1516.04s -> 1518.04s]  turnbuckle. Can he do it? He's very heavy!
[1518.04s -> 1520.04s]  Is he that strong?
[1520.04s -> 1522.04s]  He is! Gabe Newell just eliminated
[1522.04s -> 1524.04s]  Bia 846. That's another
[1524.04s -> 1526.04s]  elimination that you can tally
[1526.04s -> 1528.04s]  onto Gabe Newell. He has been
[1528.04s -> 1530.04s]  on a spree. It looks like him and Tony
[1530.04s -> 1532.04s]  the Tiger are going to- No! It's a reversal!
[1532.04s -> 1534.04s]  The pencil just reversed that double
[1534.04s -> 1536.04s]  DDT attempt. What a fantastic
[1536.04s -> 1538.04s]  double reversal that
[1538.04s -> 1540.04s]  was by the pencil. You just don't see
[1540.04s -> 1542.04s]  reversals like that anymore, let
[1542.04s -> 1544.04s]  alone from a character that's as shitty as
[1544.04s -> 1546.04s]  the pencil. Now Gabe Newell, Gabe Newell
[1546.04s -> 1548.04s]  on the defensive. Gabe Newell might be eliminated
[1548.04s -> 1550.04s]  right here by two of these assholes! No, he
[1550.04s -> 1552.04s]  ends up getting out of punches and both in the head
[1552.04s -> 1554.04s]  and for Tony the Tiger's trouble, he's going to
[1554.04s -> 1556.04s]  get thrown over. Could Gabe Newell get
[1556.04s -> 1558.04s]  another elimination here? Could it be possible?
[1558.04s -> 1560.04s]  Is Tony the Tiger going to fight back? Is the pencil
[1560.04s -> 1562.04s]  going to rescue him? No! Gabe Newell has
[1562.04s -> 1564.04s]  just eliminated Tony the Tiger as well!
[1564.04s -> 1566.04s]  Unbelievable!
[1566.04s -> 1568.04s]  Gabe Newell, that's like five
[1568.04s -> 1570.04s]  eliminations almost in a roll
[1570.04s -> 1572.04s]  for Gabe Newell and now we are down to
[1572.04s -> 1574.04s]  the final two. These are the final
[1574.04s -> 1576.04s]  competitors, the pencil
[1576.04s -> 1578.04s]  and Gabe Newell. One of
[1578.04s -> 1580.04s]  these two is going to be crowned
[1580.04s -> 1582.04s]  German Rumble 3 champion. Will it be
[1582.04s -> 1584.04s]  the shit character or will it be the most
[1584.04s -> 1586.04s]  beloved man in the history
[1586.04s -> 1588.04s]  of PC gaming? And he throws over
[1588.04s -> 1590.04s]  the pencil, body to back suplex,
[1590.04s -> 1592.04s]  and he might have possibly injured his face
[1592.04s -> 1594.04s]  on that somehow. What a
[1594.04s -> 1596.04s]  reversal. What a block and an elbow to Gabe Newell's face!
[1596.04s -> 1598.04s]  Almost blinding him, punching him in the eye,
[1598.04s -> 1600.04s]  only seeming to irritate Gabe
[1600.04s -> 1602.04s]  Newell just a little bit while he
[1602.04s -> 1604.04s]  gets him with a big boot right to his gut there.
[1604.04s -> 1606.04s]  Throws him over the ropes and they both bounce into
[1606.04s -> 1608.04s]  each other. I think Gabe Newell had a different
[1608.04s -> 1610.04s]  strategy there and he didn't utilize it.
[1610.04s -> 1612.04s]  Maybe going for a powerbomb, his patented finishing
[1612.04s -> 1614.04s]  move, the powerbomb, no! Going to
[1614.04s -> 1616.04s]  try and maybe end this right now.
[1616.04s -> 1618.04s]  No, he's just taunting, maybe catching his breath a little
[1618.04s -> 1620.04s]  bit after all that. He did eliminate a bunch of people
[1620.04s -> 1622.04s]  after all. And the pencil was probably
[1622.04s -> 1624.04s]  very low on his priorities
[1624.04s -> 1626.04s]  for who he should eliminate. And
[1626.04s -> 1628.04s]  dear God, he just threw him across the
[1628.04s -> 1630.04s]  entire ring. And the
[1630.04s -> 1632.04s]  pencil is hurt. The pencil is
[1632.04s -> 1634.04s]  really hurt right now. May have a broken
[1634.04s -> 1636.04s]  leg. Gabe Newell being a good guy, checking
[1636.04s -> 1638.04s]  on him, making sure. No!
[1638.04s -> 1640.04s]  No! What a cheap
[1640.04s -> 1642.04s]  shot that was. He cheap
[1642.04s -> 1644.04s]  shot him. He hit Gabe Newell right in his family
[1644.04s -> 1646.04s]  jewels. No, this can't be it.
[1646.04s -> 1648.04s]  It can't end like this. Gabe Newell
[1648.04s -> 1650.04s]  is holding up a dear life. Can the pencil eliminate
[1650.04s -> 1652.04s]  Gabe Newell after that cheap shot?
[1652.04s -> 1654.04s]  That's the end. The pencil
[1654.04s -> 1656.04s]  has won Jerma Rumble 3 on
[1656.04s -> 1658.04s]  a cheap, low
[1658.04s -> 1660.04s]  blow. Oh, you've
[1660.04s -> 1662.04s]  got to be kidding me. You've
[1662.04s -> 1664.04s]  got to be kidding me. Gabe Newell cannot believe
[1664.04s -> 1666.04s]  what just happened, and neither can
[1666.04s -> 1668.04s]  I, and neither can this crowd.
[1668.04s -> 1670.04s]  Do we really have to
[1670.04s -> 1672.04s]  crown this guy Jerma Rumble champion?
[1672.04s -> 1674.28s]  In the rule books, we do.
[1674.28s -> 1676.28s]  Ladies and gentlemen, your
[1676.28s -> 1678.28s]  Jerma Rumble 3 champion,
[1678.28s -> 1680.97s]  the pencil.
[1680.97s -> 1688.26s]  Jerma Rumble 3 is in the books,
[1688.26s -> 1690.26s]  and I'll see you at the next event.
