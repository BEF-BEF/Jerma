[23.35s -> 32.09s]  Hello, hello. How you doing? Welcome, everybody. A little late. Maybe a few minutes.
[33.24s -> 38.44s]  Vinny and I want to make sure that we could get in the game together. Multiplayer. We did. We are good
[38.44s -> 54.31s]  to go. Welcome to another stream. Give you the game plan today. Part one of the game. Bro, you fell
[54.31s -> 61.14s]  off. What? What are you talking about? All right. How did I even read that? That was impossible to
[61.14s -> 71.13s]  read. But yeah, today we're going to be doing some sponsored segment of the stream. This part here is
[71.13s -> 79.98s]  sponsored by EA. We're playing Wild Hearts. Looks pretty damn fun. Vinny and I. Vinny is joining us
[79.98s -> 93.69s]  today too. Hashtag ad. Should be fun. Do you read messages that have resident sleeper in it?
[94.58s -> 108.98s]  Every single one of them. And it hurts every single time. Yeah. After this, we're going to be moving to
[108.98s -> 117.85s]  the that last hero nostalgia. Should be a fun night. Looking forward to it. If you don't know
[117.85s -> 124.74s]  what Wild Hearts is, it's in that monster hunting kind of monster hunter world where it's kind of
[124.74s -> 132.70s]  a monster hunting strategy action game. So if you liked Monster Hunter, you probably would like this
[132.70s -> 147.67s]  too. That world of this type of hunting game. We're going to do face cam today. If you're good,
[148.98s -> 160.97s]  I will turn face cam on if you're good. Everybody's like, oh shit, everybody be good.
[160.97s -> 165.96s]  Everybody be really good today. Everybody has to be so good because then we're going to see his face.
[167.40s -> 172.78s]  I also like, okay, I need to like turn my face cam on at some point just to prove that I'm
[172.78s -> 177.34s]  I'm not like covered in bandages or something, right? Like I've seen the concerns and let me
[177.34s -> 186.54s]  tell you, no, I, I'm, I'm fine. I'm not bald. I heard the theory that, oh, I know why he doesn't
[186.54s -> 189.90s]  have the face cam on anymore. It's because he's bald and he went bald and he doesn't want to show
[189.90s -> 197.88s]  us. Nope. We're good. But yeah, thank you EA for sponsoring the stream. Let's get started. Wild Hearts.
[198.68s -> 211.75s]  Vinny, how are you? Like, oh, I forgot to unmute. Hey, hey, hey, hey, how are you? I'm good. Um,
[211.75s -> 220.55s]  we were talking about mitochondria. Really? Yeah. What about mitochondria? It's just cool.
[221.35s -> 225.99s]  So, um, so, so yes. Uh, how are you? I'm good.
[229.43s -> 232.55s]  All right. We need to get, we need to bring people up to speed of what happened.
[232.55s -> 236.55s]  We did the tutorial already. We wanted to get right into the goddamn game. You understand?
[237.70s -> 242.95s]  So we have not picked weapons. I know there are weapons. I think we're still in the tutorial.
[243.91s -> 251.21s]  Yeah. I think that's correct. We just looks like, yeah, we just like rescued someone and we just
[251.21s -> 257.14s]  set up camp and this is the earliest we could play online together. So we're not sure where this is
[257.14s -> 262.66s]  going to go. But, um, at the moment, I guess we both have long katanas and that's how we will kill
[262.66s -> 269.53s]  this rat. And oh, you, spoiler. Oh, right. Sorry. A rat broke through this and you didn't get to see
[269.53s -> 276.23s]  it. So we have to go hunt this rat. It was actually really cool. Very sad you didn't see it. This game
[276.23s -> 281.51s]  has, um, like a kind of a weird game play mechanic too, where you can like conjure like crates. Have
[281.51s -> 285.99s]  you done, like, did you see that? Yeah. Yeah. You could, you can make, right. Watch this.
[287.32s -> 292.66s]  Yeah. All right. Check this out. Yeah. I have to stand up first. Ready? Yeah. All right. Now
[292.66s -> 300.26s]  watch this. Where'd you go? I don't even know where you went. Oh, wow. That's amazing.
[301.86s -> 305.94s]  Wow. Oh, sorry. I did it. I just like freaked out. You can like jump off. You build stuff. You can
[305.94s -> 310.36s]  jump. It seems pretty fun. Yeah. It's like, um, breath of the fork knife.
[311.72s -> 319.32s]  Something like that. Yeah. We've got to kill, but you know, it looks really cool because I like the
[319.32s -> 325.70s]  rat. I almost don't want to kill it, but this is kind of the intro monster camp. All right.
[325.70s -> 328.26s]  Vinny, are you ready? Yeah. Yeah. Let's do this.
[328.26s -> 340.86s]  What is this? Have you? Rage tail. Get him. Okay. I'm trying. I'm, I'm, I'm pressing the wrong
[340.86s -> 347.10s]  buttons. Did you ever like play a game a lot and then get used to those buttons and then have to
[347.10s -> 351.98s]  get used to a whole new set of buttons? Yeah. And your brain doesn't know how to like. Oh,
[351.98s -> 358.98s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Ready? Uh, use your, uh, your, hold on. Ready? All right. That's
[358.98s -> 364.97s]  actually pretty cool. We do it. Uh, I don't think I did a very good job, but I heard some
[365.77s -> 374.10s]  weird noises. Yeah. You can, you can jump off these crates. That does a lot of damage. You can,
[374.10s -> 378.98s]  you can lock on to, you probably figured this out already, but yeah. How high can you put the
[378.98s -> 385.70s]  crate? Three at the moment. Maybe there's like a, oh, there's just like fucking everywhere. Can
[385.70s -> 393.13s]  you get the tail? Like, can we, can we do that? I wonder. I hope so. Cause you played other similar
[393.45s -> 400.33s]  such unnamed monster games. Yeah. Monster Hunter has that in it too. Does the monster
[400.33s -> 413.24s]  hunter have that? Yeah. Wait, you gotta get the flowers. And if you, you get low on health,
[413.24s -> 423.32s]  press up, I think on the D pad to heal. I wonder if that's consumable. What is like the rat's tail
[423.32s -> 430.49s]  or. No, no, no. Like the heels. Oh, it is. It is. Yeah. There's like, can you eat the tail?
[431.13s -> 437.85s]  Yeah. That's what I thought. No, you can. I'm going to die. There's like, there's like these
[437.85s -> 447.61s]  healing plants. Here we go. E3 can play commentary. I got your back chef. I've got you back. Stacking
[447.61s -> 457.24s]  crates. Crates now quick to a barrel roll. Oh, there's crates over here. Yeah. There you go.
[457.24s -> 461.80s]  Oh, sick. I just did a hundred damage. Get it. Now it's now it's time. Now it's time.
[461.80s -> 468.76s]  Right ahead. Now it's time. Now it's time. I think you can charge swings too. Oh, you can.
[468.76s -> 474.94s]  What do you do? Do you do ranged or do you do like melee? In let's say generic monster game
[475.98s -> 482.06s]  where you hunt said monsters, whatever it may be called, I usually go for the switch axe.
[483.24s -> 489.48s]  I like, I'm a ranged Andy. I like the range stuff. Okay. Yeah. I'm John switch axe then
[490.44s -> 496.55s]  because I liked ranged in, which one was it? Monster hunter three you, I think it was. And I
[496.55s -> 503.11s]  did like bow and arrow, but now I do a switch jacks and charge blade. I'm actually curious how
[503.11s -> 509.34s]  many weapons are in the game. Yeah. I'm kind of, I'm also curious to see if there's anything similar
[509.34s -> 513.98s]  to the switch acts. Cause that's like, all right, I got to stop doing that. It was like big chunky
[513.98s -> 518.76s]  weapons. Do I have any heels left? I think I'm out of, you know, I got, I got one more.
[520.73s -> 526.01s]  You can always like, I think you can also grab more from the environment. Oh, right. Right. Right.
[526.01s -> 532.12s]  Cool. There's like several just chilling. God damn it. Wrong button. We're going to use the,
[532.12s -> 536.68s]  the crates more. Yeah, they do. They did a hundred damage earlier from the crates.
[538.94s -> 550.74s]  Are you fat rolling? I'm fat rolling. Is there such a thing? I will say chat, like the gameplay,
[550.82s -> 557.78s]  the mechanics of the gameplay feel solid. Yeah. It actually does feel pretty polished in regards
[557.78s -> 567.00s]  to like hitting the monster in the face. So almost dead. Cool. If you need more healing,
[567.00s -> 574.42s]  there's like, uh, against the trees, there's like green bulbs. Oh, wait, I only have four more of
[574.42s -> 583.43s]  these. Uh, you have to collect like dust. There you go. Right there. I get it. These ones. Oh,
[583.43s -> 593.22s]  yeah. There we go. I don't know how much crafting is a focus of the game. Vinny Vinny. What are you
[593.22s -> 599.78s]  doing? Oh, oh, sorry. I just got carried away for a second. Yeah. We already made our characters
[599.78s -> 604.18s]  before I started the stream. Yeah. I barely, I spent three minutes making the character. I
[604.18s -> 609.80s]  didn't work too hard on it. There's like default plus like three edits. I was good with that.
[610.76s -> 623.22s]  It's very angry with things bouncing around on its, on its ball. There we go. Oh, there we go.
[623.22s -> 629.43s]  What'd you just do? Oh, I jumped off the crate. Did a hundred damage. I can't wait to make
[629.43s -> 634.31s]  by the way Vinny and Jerma were born in the same year. Are we literally 1985? Yeah. Yeah.
[634.31s -> 639.75s]  Some chat member. Oh shit. Yeah. I didn't know we were that. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. What,
[639.75s -> 645.99s]  what month are you? You just had a birthday, right? Uh, no, I'm September. Oh, okay. Boy,
[646.07s -> 649.35s]  time goes quick. Doesn't it? Time does. I really feel like that's the case though.
[651.13s -> 656.81s]  2023 feels like it started like a week ago. It's fucked up. Yeah. It's crazy. And like there's
[656.81s -> 661.29s]  already been like a ton of games to play. I don't even have like time in my life to play this many
[661.29s -> 668.65s]  video games. All right. Drag over here. I got to land that at least once. I'm doing it again.
[669.37s -> 683.50s]  Like why did it tail? Oh, there you go. Oh, did you get it? We got it. Nice. I wonder where's the
[683.50s -> 691.72s]  weak point? I would see the head bulb, big bulb. I'm going for the tail. I've been going for the
[691.72s -> 702.17s]  tail. I've been trying to get that thing off. Watch out. No big swing. That was a very gamer
[702.17s -> 708.42s]  watch out of you. I want to see the weapons. I want to get to, I want to, I, I'm very curious.
[709.22s -> 715.72s]  Yeah, me too. There's actually, this is, this, uh, if you have no weapon on,
[715.80s -> 719.24s]  you can do like a dash slide is pretty helpful. Oh yeah.
[720.44s -> 730.82s]  Durham, I think dead. I think we got it. It's like, no, no. Oh, it's still alive. Mad.
[733.62s -> 740.10s]  It's extra bad. It could spawn a tree. It just got like, do you ever get so angry that you
[740.10s -> 747.30s]  conjured a tree? I like the fact that you can ride on the ball. That's weird. Maybe it hurts.
[748.18s -> 761.72s]  I mean, usually it does. Oh my God. I have no Jesus. Oh, I'm unconscious. Yeah. Just
[761.72s -> 772.66s]  mash, mash buttons. Wait, did you drop something? Someone said, someone said, what the fuck is going
[772.66s -> 778.58s]  on? Hey, grab, grab. Hey, Dre. Oh, here's an item. Rage tail thing. Just I think you cut it off.
[779.54s -> 786.20s]  Oh, okay. Okay. Get your head in the game. I know. I know. What does it look like?
[787.00s -> 790.12s]  We're just a couple of dudes hunting a giant like angry rat.
[793.75s -> 798.23s]  Those cubes, you just do so much more damage. Yeah, you do. All right. Right in the head.
[802.42s -> 809.22s]  There you go. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Finish it. Do you want me to do it? You can do it. Yeah,
[809.22s -> 820.76s]  you do it. Look at your face. I forgot he looks like this. Now stay down. That's it. Why am I
[820.84s -> 825.64s]  saying this to you? What's the chef cooking up this time? See, that's how you do it.
[825.64s -> 830.87s]  Why am I saying that stuff? Now stay down. That's it then. There you go.
[834.01s -> 844.25s]  Let me increase the volume of Jeremy because you can conjure. Wait, can you make,
[844.97s -> 851.37s]  can we make like a bunch of like, would you like a bunch of like Minecraft piston stuff? Hold on a
[851.37s -> 859.59s]  minute. Kind of looks like it. This thing's going crazy. Yeah, it just propels you forward.
[859.59s -> 863.43s]  All right. That's crates. You can, you can jump up. Oh, I gotta get my car. I didn't even get the
[863.43s -> 871.11s]  car. Is there a car? I think we just got it. Did you get that screen? Did you get a game? Oh,
[871.11s -> 875.19s]  you did a completed screen with all the. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I didn't see this
[875.19s -> 878.95s]  stuff because I was, I was looking at the chat. All right. Now we got to make sure the woman back
[878.95s -> 890.22s]  safe is the woman back at camp is safe. Oh, we have to go back to camp. Yeah. So I see it. It's
[890.22s -> 897.59s]  the, yeah. The icon. Yeah. It's really, it's convenient when you're a streamer and you can
[897.59s -> 905.26s]  just blame chat whenever you don't see something. It's like, no, I was looking at chat. You're going
[905.26s -> 918.76s]  on here. We said I unironically want this game. Yeah. I mean, it seems pretty fun. I like how
[918.76s -> 925.00s]  everything has to be like, sorry. Everything has some layer of irony on the internet. So it's like,
[925.00s -> 932.28s]  it's good to clarify just in case, like, you never know when, when there's irony on the internet.
[932.28s -> 939.80s]  Some people don't use CAPAs. How's performance been? Performance has been pretty good for me.
[939.80s -> 944.28s]  There's a little bit of slowdown on some of the new loading areas, but at least from what you're
[944.28s -> 948.20s]  seeing here so far, it's, it seems pretty good. How about you? Yeah. It hasn't, it hasn't been too
[948.20s -> 953.56s]  bad. I'll tell you what it earlier in the tutorial, I had a couple of spots. There's,
[953.56s -> 959.96s]  I think there's a big patch on the way to, which that will be nice, but I turned down like one or
[959.96s -> 967.72s]  two settings and it's been mostly okay. I feel like once it loads a new area, you just run kind
[967.72s -> 975.08s]  of smooth, but yeah, like, you know, it's a new game. I'm moving, I'm moving around a lot. I mean,
[975.08s -> 981.59s]  I, I don't seem to have that many issues. Not saying that people don't have issues, right?
[982.31s -> 1001.32s]  So I guess we talk to her. I do have to admit, I skipped a third of the cutscenes. So I kind of know
[1001.32s -> 1004.20s]  what's happening. Oh, I skipped all of them. Oh no, because we were like, oh, let's get,
[1004.20s -> 1006.44s]  we've got to get in a game together. Let's test the multiplayer.
[1007.40s -> 1007.72s]  Mm hmm.
[1012.81s -> 1019.02s]  I have like an idea of what's going on. That's my character. Yeah. You look kind of cool.
[1020.30s -> 1026.46s]  I guess I was like default, default, default, change one thing. Oh, you did default everything.
[1026.46s -> 1044.87s]  Okay. So big monster. Oh, you can see, you can see all of our Tetris pieces.
[1051.62s -> 1054.66s]  By the way, your placement of your blocks is fucking awful.
[1058.82s -> 1060.50s]  Spread them out a little more moron.
[1060.98s -> 1071.96s]  I have to, who? He only came with me because I insisted. Wait.
[1073.48s -> 1079.40s]  Well, you can see when I skipped the dialogue. Yeah. Oh, wait, can I, are you skipping her now?
[1080.20s -> 1090.65s]  A little bit. Oh, it's a monster. Oh, I just turned the audio off.
[1090.65s -> 1097.37s]  Okay. So she's a blacksmith and she can help us get weapons. So we're going to,
[1097.37s -> 1102.49s]  we're going to get weapons now, I think. Also, I do have to bring this up because this is,
[1102.49s -> 1111.94s]  this is a good feature. You and I are just in the game together. Yeah. You and we don't, I,
[1111.94s -> 1115.54s]  I don't, let's see what happens here, but I, we're not, it's not like, oh, we have to join
[1115.54s -> 1120.84s]  this lobby and then that lobby. I think we're just in the game permanently. Okay. So, oh yeah,
[1120.84s -> 1127.35s]  there, I see you. I see the chef, but I'm like, oh, I have to return to you. So wait, you're not
[1127.35s -> 1137.80s]  escorting this person. So, okay. That's interesting. You were at camp while I was doing the cut scene.
[1137.80s -> 1143.21s]  Yeah. Wow. So maybe it just puts me at the camp when you're, if a cut scene is activated.
[1144.60s -> 1154.12s]  Okay. Hold on. Open your info screen and select. Oh, there's a map. Okay. Turn your face came on.
[1154.12s -> 1161.99s]  I told you, if you're good, I'll turn it on. Don't threaten them with a good time. Okay. Here we go.
[1161.99s -> 1169.35s]  So you have like a tree, types of Karakuri. You can use the kimono orbs that you obtain by hunting
[1169.35s -> 1175.86s]  kimono to awaken new types of Karakuri or strengthen Karakuri you've already awakened.
[1175.86s -> 1179.94s]  Knowledge of certain Karakuri cannot be awakened using kimono orbs. Instead, you need a flash of
[1179.94s -> 1184.52s]  inspiration in the midst of hunting particular kimono or some other hunting success to unlock
[1184.52s -> 1189.64s]  such Karakuri secrets and conjure them for the first time. So there's like a tree. Okay. So this
[1189.64s -> 1195.98s]  is the one we've been using. It's massive. If you scroll all the way down, like hold X and scroll
[1195.98s -> 1206.81s]  all the way down, it's insane. Oh my God. What is going on? What? I thought that was, it wasn't
[1206.81s -> 1213.48s]  repeating. That's a lot of whatever that is. I guess cause this game, it looks like this game's
[1213.48s -> 1217.96s]  feature or one of its features to set itself apart is that you can like actually build your camp the
[1217.96s -> 1226.09s]  way you want to. Oh yeah. Okay. Cool. So yo, that's a lot. Sugoi.
[1238.60s -> 1245.96s]  Make what? Make what? I didn't hear it. Oh, sorry. I think she said bow. Oh, she's gonna take apart
[1245.96s -> 1255.16s]  the Katana. Time to choose your weapon. I know I want to switch X. If there's no switch X,
[1255.16s -> 1263.24s]  then I'll take the biggest dumbest object I can use. Forging. Have a weapon forged.
[1266.28s -> 1272.38s]  Oh man. This is like, look at this. Oh, here they are. Well, we can't get all of them right now.
[1272.38s -> 1280.33s]  It's like, I think, I think you have to do some stuff. All right. But what do I want? Katana?
[1281.67s -> 1290.65s]  Nodachi, bow, maul, bladed, wagasa. What is that? An umbrella. Yeah. It's an umbrella.
[1294.92s -> 1299.34s]  What do you think? What are you into? I'll let you choose first and then I'll just,
[1299.34s -> 1303.06s]  I'll choose second because I'm just happy to be here.
[1305.66s -> 1317.05s]  I'm just happy to be here. Vinny, you are, you are, you're the best. Thanks man. Well,
[1317.05s -> 1323.43s]  I mean, thank you for, you know, getting me the game and stuff. Appreciate it. Vinny's a good dude.
[1323.43s -> 1330.86s]  All right. So what do you, I think, should I do the, I usually would probably, I'd go maul.
[1330.86s -> 1337.34s]  Either maul or bow. I mean, I'll just, I'll probably do the Nodachi then because it's like a big sword.
[1337.34s -> 1345.74s]  I want to be like Cloud from Final Fantasy 7. Maybe I should do. What do I want to do? What
[1345.74s -> 1355.88s]  are you guys saying? Wagasa or maul? Can we get a pole? I'll do either one. Looks like you can
[1355.88s -> 1361.08s]  already upgrade it too. Once you get your first one, like you have the choice of like the weapon
[1361.08s -> 1368.94s]  tree because we killed that rat now and we could use the rats like bones and gore and like organs
[1368.94s -> 1380.94s]  and spleen and stuff. Umbrella now, umbrella now. You know what? All right. I'll do, I'll do the
[1380.94s -> 1392.74s]  Wagasa. Chat, this is a tough choice. I don't, I don't know which one I want to go. Oh yeah,
[1392.74s -> 1397.22s]  we already can do this. All right. Critical master or savage. I don't know what savage is.
[1397.22s -> 1406.78s]  Oh goodness. Okay. I don't, this is, this is a lot of options. Yeah, it's, it's skill details. So
[1406.78s -> 1412.30s]  savage increases attack. You can press Y. Critical master boosts the chance of critical strike. So
[1412.30s -> 1417.34s]  I'm going to go for my critical sword. I don't have the materials to do the other one. So I
[1417.34s -> 1422.17s]  think we're both going to do the critical one. Okay. Although you could wait and go,
[1422.90s -> 1430.18s]  you could go this other path. There's that left path too. Hey, I want to. Okay. I might as well do
[1430.18s -> 1440.57s]  more damage. Okay. I got big sword and then armor too. I don't know if we can make armor.
[1440.57s -> 1445.69s]  So yeah, they all have their own individual trees. That's cool. Yeah. I mean, it's nice visually.
[1445.69s -> 1456.18s]  I'm going to get, um, the gauntlets. I think this is just teaching us how to do this. Yeah. Very
[1456.18s -> 1472.57s]  cool. All right. Let me see your weapon. Ooh. Can you charge it? Big energy. Like I can just like
[1472.57s -> 1483.22s]  unleash energy. Wait, I got, I have a hop. That's cool. Umbrella is amazing. Can you,
[1483.22s -> 1491.93s]  what happens when you hold a ZR or R2? Like I like spin it. I think it's a block or like a parry.
[1491.93s -> 1501.82s]  Okay. Can I charge, let me see if I can charge this. It is a parry. All right. That's cool.
[1501.82s -> 1509.00s]  The problem with the problem with me is I keep trying to press R and R2 to attack. Yeah. All the
[1509.00s -> 1517.59s]  Elden Ring, all the, every, all the from software games. Yeah. All right. We, um, oh, make a plan
[1517.59s -> 1524.66s]  for the hunt around the campfire. You want to make a plan? Yeah. I unlocked something else though.
[1524.66s -> 1533.54s]  See if I can figure that out. I unlocked a, um, so we got a drying rack for food. Let's make some
[1533.54s -> 1541.19s]  steaks. And I also got a hunting tower that uses celestial thread to seek out kimono in the
[1541.19s -> 1547.72s]  wilderness. Sends out pulses from the turret to use as echoes that return the chart. Okay. So we
[1547.72s -> 1555.72s]  can find monsters. Okay. So we, when you sit down at the campfire is when you decide on what you
[1555.72s -> 1562.26s]  want to do next. Okay. From the map, you can take on quests or travel instantly to camps and other
[1562.26s -> 1566.98s]  places out in the wilderness. Quests come about when the people of Minato make requests of you
[1566.98s -> 1570.18s]  and your hunting skills. And when there's a kimono thread that needs it. So we can kind of
[1570.18s -> 1576.15s]  port around. Some can be taken as many times as you like, right? Okay. So I think there's like
[1576.15s -> 1579.66s]  story missions. There's other missions, but I think we can just do it from together from the
[1580.38s -> 1590.60s]  campfire. So yeah, I see, I see more rage tales, but, um, I don't know. It's up to you. What do
[1590.60s -> 1594.42s]  you want to, you want to go for another rage tale or do you want to, I don't know how we find like
[1594.42s -> 1600.95s]  new monsters. I think we can do rage tale again if we want to, but, um, we talked to her for another
[1600.95s -> 1610.46s]  one. Yeah. You want to do it? Yeah, let's do it. Actually you might have to do it because you're
[1610.46s -> 1621.24s]  the host. Oh, that's right. Okay. So wait, what happens when you, um, do you watch this or you're
[1621.24s -> 1624.12s]  just like running around looking at nothing? No, I can see, I can see what you're doing.
[1624.12s -> 1629.66s]  Oh, okay. Okay. There's a weapon later in the game that's basically the charge blade
[1629.66s -> 1631.90s]  switch axe thing you're looking for. Sick.
[1631.90s -> 1644.42s]  The monster design is actually very good.
[1649.38s -> 1655.70s]  It looks like they put like truthfully, they put a lot of like budget into making things look cool.
[1666.18s -> 1672.42s]  Someone said crisis looks better. What do you know about my brother in crisis? That is a 20
[1672.42s -> 1677.86s]  year old game. Somebody just said, what do you know about design? I don't know. I just think
[1677.86s -> 1685.38s]  the games, I just play games. I don't know. All right. Saps scourge. So we're going after the
[1685.38s -> 1693.38s]  step. Are we, are we prepared? Huh? Um, yeah, I feel like the preparation is, is less than we
[1693.38s -> 1700.63s]  would expect maybe, but let me talk to her again. Yeah, it's, I'm ready to rock and roll.
[1700.63s -> 1708.65s]  Yeah, we can, we can just start fighting like, do we have to remove these or are they just all
[1708.65s -> 1715.26s]  permanently here? They're just still here. Oh yeah. Why are they still here? I think they're
[1715.26s -> 1721.42s]  permanent. You have to be very, maybe you can take them down. Do you have enough healing like juice?
[1721.42s -> 1727.66s]  Um, wait, if you conjure a hunting tower, you'll be able to detect kimono in the surrounding area.
[1728.90s -> 1735.64s]  Yeah, I got one of those in the tower. I, I, I did one of those. That's, uh,
[1735.64s -> 1743.54s]  Oh, and I think it wants us to make it. Oh, I can catch the snake. I just caught a snake.
[1743.54s -> 1747.45s]  Can't fire. Where's hunting tower? Wait, do you see the enemy?
[1747.45s -> 1754.23s]  All right. So the game is telling us to go down the tree in your Karakuri tree and unlock the
[1754.23s -> 1760.97s]  hunting tower. It's like a radar. Okay. Cause I, I have the monster on my, uh,
[1762.17s -> 1769.43s]  UI. I can see it for the wall too. All right. Um, did you see that little fella? Where?
[1769.43s -> 1777.91s]  This little fella here. Oh, I see a friend. Hunter aids. You can enhance them at campfires.
[1777.91s -> 1788.30s]  I think those are like cats. Did you collect them? Yeah. I think you, you collect them and then you
[1788.30s -> 1794.46s]  can use them to like tank hits from giant rats so that you don't, you don't die. And they do
[1794.46s -> 1800.06s]  something like that. Make changes to them. Okay. Cool. I think we have to upgrade our menu at least
[1800.06s -> 1807.72s]  down to the tower. How did you know how to do that? In your menu, go to the Karakuri menu.
[1807.72s -> 1818.30s]  It's like to the right and then hunting tower. What does this actually do? Field Forge. Um,
[1818.30s -> 1825.82s]  Oh, I think we can build stuff out in the wilderness. Okay. That's cool. We can build a
[1825.82s -> 1831.82s]  tower here. Yeah. So I guess this, um, seek out kimono in the wilderness. It sounds out pulses
[1831.82s -> 1836.54s]  from the turret and uses the echoes that returned to chart the lay of the land. And look, I say,
[1836.54s -> 1841.43s]  I think it's like, you can get map reveal with it. Yeah. I, I built one at base and, um,
[1841.43s -> 1851.72s]  I'll build another one here and see if this does anything, but it's already in operation. It says,
[1851.72s -> 1859.56s]  Oh, there it is. Okay. Yeah. I don't know. So I think, I think this just kind of sits on the map.
[1859.56s -> 1864.92s]  Maybe it beeps when, uh, it detects something nearby. Oh, we just follow the thread. If you
[1864.92s -> 1876.57s]  hold L two, it just like shows you like a path to the enemy. I got full heels. Okay. There it is.
[1876.57s -> 1883.69s]  Is this on iPad? Um, no, it's not. What the fuck is that? Look up. There's two of them. Oh gosh.
[1883.69s -> 1891.03s]  Why is there two? Why? Okay. Well, these days monster games need to have at least two.
[1893.21s -> 1901.94s]  All right, let's go. Oh boy. I wonder how the parry work. It said we can request assistance.
[1901.94s -> 1905.62s]  I guess we could just get like randos to jump in. I'm imagining it's probably that.
[1907.22s -> 1909.94s]  All right. I'm going to build a spring and see what this is.
[1909.94s -> 1917.59s]  I hope that other thing doesn't. The other thing is still over there. It's hiding.
[1918.49s -> 1934.36s]  Oh boy. Are you dead? No, almost. I'm just healing. What are we thinking? What are we thinking?
[1935.00s -> 1941.64s]  I'm just going to put shit everywhere. Head empty. All right. I might be like annoying,
[1941.64s -> 1947.00s]  but whatever. No, no, no. I'm trying. I do it. You put everything everywhere.
[1947.00s -> 1949.56s]  I just did like 150 damage or more to this thing.
[1949.56s -> 1962.70s]  Ooh. All right. That's funny. Use a spring to dodge. Oh, you put these around to not get.
[1962.70s -> 1967.34s]  Okay. I get it. I get it. I get it. So you put them in places where you know you can dodge.
[1968.22s -> 1985.56s]  Trying to charge my attack. Yeah. Oh, some of the sack blue.
[1990.28s -> 1996.89s]  It's fine. I do like a weird dive. I would go straight down on the crown of my head.
[2003.66s -> 2012.31s]  I kind of float in the air. Also. Yeah, dude. The amount of damage you do from a tower is insane.
[2012.31s -> 2018.22s]  It's unbelievable. It's so good. All right. I figured out how this thing works.
[2019.54s -> 2025.46s]  You want to be in the air. Wait, is it gone? Wait, wait. I think you might've,
[2025.46s -> 2029.06s]  I think you, you cut something off over here. Did I? Okay. Hang on.
[2030.52s -> 2035.32s]  Zap Scourge Amber. I just picked up a weird thing that allows me to build more stuff. I think.
[2035.32s -> 2042.26s]  I don't know. Hold R T and X to build your meter faster and then release R T for a charged attacks
[2042.26s -> 2049.22s]  as a chat member. Helpful help. Today we have helpful chat members. Like I didn't, I didn't know.
[2050.02s -> 2057.05s]  So wait, where did, where did that monster go? All right. We got a marker. Yeah. We got a marker.
[2057.05s -> 2071.82s]  There's a rage tail behind us, but yeah, let's just mark it. Oh no. Oh, that's a turtle. I chat.
[2071.82s -> 2075.10s]  I get it. You're trying to get me to say the forbidden words. I'm not going to say them
[2075.42s -> 2085.08s]  just like wiped his eyes. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, look, look, look. Yes. What? This is one of those
[2085.08s -> 2095.66s]  friends. Oh, okay. I'll grab one. Okay. We need the bear at the camp logic to train and see all the
[2095.66s -> 2100.38s]  combos you can do. Interesting. That's, that's the way you work it. That's the way you go for it.
[2104.79s -> 2109.19s]  Put down some of those, those tools and just bounce off them and jump in the air and stuff.
[2110.07s -> 2130.65s]  Okay. Oh, it rolls around. Oh, I got to collect that. Wrong thing.
[2139.51s -> 2142.23s]  Dude. Yeah. You fly in the air. I like that. This weapon is actually pretty fun.
[2146.54s -> 2155.85s]  More stuff rolls around, comes around. I guess so. Yeah. That's sort of fun too.
[2155.85s -> 2163.27s]  What's the thing around it on his left leg? Like a blue thing? Uh, I don't know.
[2163.35s -> 2179.27s]  It's like a wonderful spot. Yeah, that's weird. I don't know what that is. Damn it. Things.
[2180.23s -> 2183.29s]  I want to try the parry. I'm going to try a parry. Let's see what happens.
[2184.01s -> 2188.01s]  Wait, is that a specific to your weapon? Oh, it is. It is. I think so. I wonder how it works.
[2188.97s -> 2199.18s]  Wait, I think we did enough damage. It's running. All right. Use springs quick.
[2200.06s -> 2208.68s]  I mean, I mean, they help a little bit. We are just fucking up this whole area though.
[2209.24s -> 2214.52s]  These are going to be here forever. Yeah. Oh, this beautiful area. We like,
[2214.52s -> 2220.74s]  this is a comment on industrialization, this game. I used all of my breads.
[2225.00s -> 2234.36s]  I know there's more. It's like some of the trees maybe. Oh, you can slide too.
[2235.08s -> 2239.32s]  Chat member, I swear you've typed that like 18 times since I started.
[2241.08s -> 2243.80s]  Look out for the snake. Look at this guy. This guy's just trying to hang. No.
[2244.76s -> 2249.88s]  I need to save the snake so bad. Okay. Thank God. That's like the most concerning thing
[2249.88s -> 2262.15s]  of the whole game for me so far. What's wrong with me? Oh, oh God. Oh, I got out just in time.
[2262.15s -> 2272.02s]  I'm out. I gotta get more. He loves animals. Yeah. As I kill one right here. Yeah.
[2273.14s -> 2284.44s]  And forests. We love the forests. You keep chopping down the trees like that. Oh,
[2285.16s -> 2297.02s]  shoot some sticky. All right. You, I sappy substance. Oh, where is he? Okay. Oh, I'm
[2297.02s -> 2305.70s]  going to use yours. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It really does. So it's insane. Like I, and I combo with
[2305.70s -> 2314.09s]  it. Like I ended up doing like a hundred hits. I love the elbow drop that I can do with this thing.
[2317.42s -> 2328.87s]  Okay. I just got really knocked off. Oh, Vinny, I might die. I'm going to die. I'm trying to help.
[2328.87s -> 2335.35s]  I'm trying to get attention. Dodge chef. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. I just went back into the fire.
[2340.54s -> 2345.99s]  Oh, he's angry Vinny. Oh boy. Yeah. It's dropping like, like,
[2345.99s -> 2352.31s]  Oh, whatever this is. Oh, sap scourge. That's right. That's the name. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look at
[2352.31s -> 2357.90s]  this. Hold on. Can you climb this? I'm going off the top rope. Oh my God. It's eating me.
[2357.90s -> 2361.50s]  It's a tree. It's a tree and it's eating me. How does it have a mouth?
[2362.30s -> 2371.82s]  Where you be? Where are you? Sorry. Sorry to make all these weird noises. No, it's all right. No,
[2371.82s -> 2375.74s]  I'm good. It's just this, this enemy is literally like a tree creature. I didn't even realize that
[2375.74s -> 2392.74s]  until just now. It's taken down the whole forest. It's so sappy. Jesus. Shit. I missed you climb
[2392.74s -> 2399.64s]  freeze. Not like you can climb the crates. I don't think those are like made. Those crates were made
[2399.64s -> 2420.62s]  for climbing. That's just what they'll do. Yeah. Same here. I'm sorry. I keep missing it and it's
[2420.62s -> 2434.28s]  so cool. Great egg commentary. Okay. I feel like we're in the last phase here. We have to be. It's
[2434.28s -> 2444.14s]  angry. We've been hitting it. There we go. We've been sapped upon several times by now. Oh,
[2444.94s -> 2466.89s]  Oh, under leveled. Oh, he is eating me too. Here we go. It's good damage on now.
[2467.69s -> 2474.89s]  I'm trying to see. I know there's like other attacks that you can combo. Like I'm seeing in
[2474.89s -> 2481.69s]  the top right. Oh, that's hot dog. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Massive damage. Absolutely
[2481.69s -> 2488.94s]  massive damage for me. Get that shit. Get up there. Drop the crates. Get up the crate.
[2494.98s -> 2508.97s]  You did 40 DPS. I'm doing fine. Jay is saying that my graphics look better than your graphics.
[2508.97s -> 2515.29s]  You do. I don't know. You have to show little bro. Germa your settings as a chat member.
[2515.29s -> 2521.51s]  What are your settings? Um, I don't know. I have most things on high. I got rid of ambient
[2521.51s -> 2526.79s]  inclusion and motion blur and everything else is on high. It looks apparent chat saying it like
[2527.43s -> 2533.83s]  my graphics is good. My graphics are not good. All right. I don't know. Look better. You have
[2533.83s -> 2539.66s]  a better GPU than me though. I do. Yeah, you do look better. We don't get time for this. We
[2539.66s -> 2553.27s]  got to hunt the monster. Yeah, we got to. That's right. Oh, there's a little fella here. I don't
[2553.27s -> 2559.59s]  know if we can catch it. I caught it. The same graphics are wicked crisp. Why am I not crisp?
[2559.59s -> 2566.78s]  I didn't apply them. Is that chat member from Boston? Did you actually say wicked growing up?
[2566.78s -> 2570.14s]  Like was that like a regional thing? Because we did not have that in New York. All the time.
[2570.14s -> 2573.98s]  No one was saying wicked when I was growing up. Like when Ocarina of Time came out, no one was
[2573.98s -> 2580.60s]  saying it was a wicked cool game in New York. That was actually a thing Germa that you were
[2580.60s -> 2589.16s]  saying wicked. I said wicked all the time. Yeah. Did you ever hear of like herbs? Do you know like
[2589.16s -> 2596.79s]  when someone's a herb? That I don't. I don't know. Okay. Is that what you. I think a little
[2596.79s -> 2603.67s]  little bit of that or if someone's a skel, do you know skel? Skel? No. Yeah. Like if they're on like
[2604.87s -> 2612.47s]  a fellow of ill repute is a skel. We got we've got a weird we've got like an asparagus dragon over
[2612.47s -> 2631.53s]  here. Yeah. Let's do it. Why is this here? Let's get rolled over. I love I'm fighting just like
[2631.53s -> 2636.57s]  the random shitty enemy and it's an intense fight and you're over there fighting the real monster.
[2636.57s -> 2654.22s]  I'm trying it. Oh, you got it. You actually got the tail. You could do it. It's real. Climb it.
[2654.22s -> 2662.06s]  Climb. Oh shit. I'm on his back. Oh, you can do that. I'm on his back. What do I do? I don't
[2662.06s -> 2678.49s]  know. Press buttons. All right. I'm still fine. Come on Vinny. Kill it. I don't know. How do I
[2678.49s -> 2703.16s]  thrust? Oh, those hits. I hope there's no damage meter because you're probably doing 80% of all
[2703.16s -> 2708.20s]  the damage. I don't think so, man. I'm doing okay. But there are moments where I just don't get any
[2708.20s -> 2718.49s]  hits for like a minute. There's no health bar. There usually isn't in these games. Yeah. No,
[2718.49s -> 2731.94s]  you just have to like if the monster is like limping or if the monster seems tired or weak,
[2731.94s -> 2739.35s]  that's how you know you're almost done. Definitely on this there. We have to be. You need to parry
[2739.35s -> 2746.15s]  to do real damage with this weapon. All right. I'll learn it after this. Finish what? Oh, wait.
[2746.15s -> 2763.19s]  This thing's still alive. That was kind of sad. Oh, oh no. Shit. I'm going to try to parry.
[2765.11s -> 2771.24s]  Oh, I'm dead. Okay. I don't think I can get you back. I think I can get. I'm going to see.
[2772.36s -> 2786.42s]  Be careful. Oh, it's eating me alive. Oh my God. Bro, why? No, no, no. I'm sapped up. I'm
[2786.42s -> 2791.85s]  saying this about killing monsters. I'm sitting there going like, oh no.
[2792.65s -> 2803.13s]  Let's see. I think I can rescue. I can rescue you. Oh my goodness. You were just in time.
[2804.25s -> 2817.58s]  Died to sap scourge omega low. I'm fine. Don't know the combos. If I would be so much more
[2817.58s -> 2822.74s]  effective with this weapon. If I knew the combos, I've got to figure out the parry. That's how you
[2822.74s -> 2830.86s]  get this to work. Yeah. For yours, that would probably be amazing. Even angrier. We are at
[2831.18s -> 2840.79s]  anger levels. Never seen before. Stay alive. Keep going. That's sap off of us.
[2841.51s -> 2850.10s]  Ungar max. That's right. That's Barrett's limit break in final fantasy. Ungar max.
[2850.90s -> 2855.22s]  Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. Did you ever hear about that? What was it?
[2856.02s -> 2860.26s]  There was a mistranslation of Barrett's limit break in final fantasy seven.
[2861.22s -> 2867.08s]  And they called it Ungar max when it should have been anger max. We won. I was like a little kid.
[2867.08s -> 2874.31s]  I was like, what's Ungar max? Yeah, they just mistranslated it. Hey, I got the final blow.
[2878.90s -> 2890.44s]  All right. Ungar. New word every day. Flying vine. Karakuri awaken. Oh, that's me. Yeah. So
[2890.44s -> 2896.28s]  one of the big selling points of this game is the fact that you can put, I mean, we're doing these
[2896.28s -> 2901.48s]  things, but there are a ton of these tools. You can like put like zip lines around. You could,
[2901.56s -> 2906.44s]  I think it's pretty handy to make like almost like a little fort in the monster fight area.
[2907.16s -> 2913.11s]  Like at night. Well, during the day too. Okay. During the day too. Good. Good.
[2922.38s -> 2926.06s]  Your gamma is too high. I'm a regular hunter. If you say so. Can I turn my gamma down?
[2928.14s -> 2938.01s]  Turn down your gamma. My gamma is like so high. Is that why the graphics is different? I think
[2938.01s -> 2950.20s]  that's probably what's going on. Yeah. You mean that explains it. She roped me to doing her dirty
[2950.20s -> 2954.92s]  work for turn on ambient occlusion. It breaks the shaders. If it's off. Okay. Oh, all right.
[2954.92s -> 2963.67s]  Mine are off too. I'll turn mine back on then. Weird. You made camp teacher in that case lead
[2963.67s -> 2972.65s]  the way much as I like the idea of a statue in my honor. I don't want to keep it. So this takes
[2972.65s -> 2980.49s]  place in medieval Japan. Yeah, that's right. I was thinking or like some very, I mean there's
[2980.49s -> 2986.34s]  monsters. So look at this. You, you awaken the flying vine dragon. Hold on a minute.
[2986.98s -> 2993.58s]  Did you see that? Yeah. Let's see if we can make it. Instruct your own network of corridors
[2993.58s -> 2997.18s]  through the wilderness. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. I think we're, I think everything is
[2997.18s -> 3003.82s]  permanent. We're supposed to make essentially our own permanent resources to travel around.
[3007.43s -> 3019.40s]  Let's see if we can do it. Let me do this real quick. The tail is, I think I carved the tail
[3019.40s -> 3025.42s]  already chat. Like there would be like a green stink around it if I didn't. And I'm pretty sure
[3025.42s -> 3035.56s]  I got that. Oh, that does look better. Oh, you know what? Here, let me turn the ambient occlusion
[3035.56s -> 3044.41s]  on. Oh, it's a thousand times better. Wow. Okay. Yeah. They weren't kidding. Yeah. This actually
[3044.41s -> 3051.98s]  looks like this is great. I had my, I had my gamma up like way too high. All right, cool.
[3051.98s -> 3057.74s]  I'm trying to build the thing, the flying vine thing. Yeah. Cause we're in a cave. We can't
[3057.74s -> 3072.81s]  let's, let's get out of this cave and see what happens. Oh, I got one. You did it. Yep. This
[3072.81s -> 3085.42s]  should help. Oh, wait. Oh, I didn't, I made the wrong thing. Wait, did I make the wrong thing?
[3087.32s -> 3094.12s]  Maybe. I made like, I made like a fucking, like a trebuchet. Oh, wait. No, I think that's it.
[3094.12s -> 3104.41s]  It's the one all the way to the right, right? Why are you not holding A? Wait. Oh, whoa, whoa,
[3104.41s -> 3108.97s]  whoa. I get it. Oops. I blew it. You got to hold A. Oh, I blew it big time. I get it.
[3110.17s -> 3113.77s]  Okay. You have to aim the thing and shoot it. I thought it was that we connected together.
[3114.41s -> 3135.96s]  Let me try it. Okay. Wait, how do I yeet myself? Oh, you jump and you hold right bumper.
[3136.98s -> 3150.74s]  You hold right? Um, RBA. I re I press that chat. I press that. It's literally tells you.
[3150.74s -> 3155.70s]  I know it tells me, but it's not working. RB. Oh, I was pressing LB. Dude, that thing's going
[3155.70s -> 3162.18s]  like two feet. It's fine. Do you want, oh, you're all the way over there. Let me get to you real
[3162.18s -> 3171.56s]  quick. No, there's nothing over here. It's fine. I mean, all right. That was, all right. That's
[3171.56s -> 3176.52s]  cool. It's, it's cool, but it didn't, I didn't really build an effective one. We need to,
[3176.52s -> 3182.57s]  okay. The next Mossberry fight, we have to build a little base around it. Okay. You can teleport
[3182.57s -> 3194.65s]  to camp from the maps as a chat member. Oh, you can. You can. Oh, you can. It's useful.
[3194.65s -> 3201.18s]  Only hosts can do that. Wait, no, no, no. Okay. I'm good. I'm gone. Oh, there you are. Okay. Here.
[3201.18s -> 3210.42s]  I'm going to build one of these. The dragon pit isn't powerful enough. Oh, we need more like
[3210.42s -> 3215.62s]  capacity to build extra stuff. I think I am going to become so compulsive with this because these
[3215.62s -> 3227.99s]  things are permanent. Hunter with death stranding. There's elements of both. You're sure. What's up,
[3227.99s -> 3233.35s]  Jeremy? I was going to say the, if everything is permanent, I feel like there's a lot of people
[3233.35s -> 3237.35s]  that are going to make insane travel basis. Like you're going to be able to go anywhere.
[3238.79s -> 3243.59s]  Some of you that get this game and just build networks. Yeah. I'm curious like the insane
[3243.59s -> 3249.11s]  networks people are going to build with all the stuff unlocked. I'd be preserved in amber right
[3249.11s -> 3260.57s]  now. Exposed for all to see. You paint a green picture. It really was fortunate. You're right.
[3261.69s -> 3265.53s]  Did you see this one in battle? We are face cam imminent by the way. I want to make sure
[3265.53s -> 3274.92s]  everyone's aware. I know creating out of thin air like that. That's a skill I simply have to learn.
[3275.88s -> 3279.40s]  Good. We've, we were good. We've been good. I'd like to get back to me.
[3283.08s -> 3289.40s]  No, I'm not turning. I don't know. Oh no. Yeah. No, don't wait. Not, you know, not you. No,
[3289.40s -> 3293.24s]  no. My, my chat's like, you should do it too. Vin. I'm like, I don't care how good the chat's been.
[3294.68s -> 3298.60s]  I've been, uh, lazy for that. I've been streaming with it off, uh, with it off recently.
[3300.54s -> 3304.38s]  It's just, it's nice because I could sit back in my chair and I can just look like shit.
[3304.38s -> 3309.18s]  I know not have like light lights on. Like I can stream in the dark and damage my eyes. It's fun.
[3310.22s -> 3317.96s]  I like it. I was using a game boy camera for a while and you like, that was actually my,
[3319.00s -> 3323.40s]  were you actually doing that? Not a real one, but I found a way to make it work.
[3323.40s -> 3331.02s]  Oh, that's so funny. It was cool. What was that? Oh, I thought he, I thought he farted.
[3333.90s -> 3334.94s]  Suburban Sasquatch.
[3334.94s -> 3339.58s]  Probably haven't eaten a thing since we were, I was looking over at the chat and I just said,
[3341.50s -> 3345.74s]  okay, so we're going to eat because that guy's stomach was growling and we have food.
[3346.62s -> 3348.06s]  All right. There we go. It's all real.
[3353.05s -> 3359.22s]  That's a very interesting way to sit. Let's not linger here any longer.
[3359.22s -> 3361.06s]  Good. It's, it's, it's good on the spine.
[3361.86s -> 3365.45s]  Mm hmm. It's a nice permanent spine damage.
[3366.09s -> 3366.49s]  Fuck. Yeah.
[3373.54s -> 3383.56s]  That's fun. Oh, wait, what's this chat members? Oh, hang on. I just tabbed out by accident. Chat
[3383.56s -> 3394.55s]  member. Can you repeat that about the audio thing? You have to break the dragon vines you place to
[3394.55s -> 3399.67s]  make more. And two, if you change your audio settings to 5.1, your FPS gets doubled. Really?
[3400.31s -> 3407.99s]  5.1. Huh. All right. I'll try. Let's try it.
[3407.99s -> 3411.86s]  You'll have to do this scouting alone. Please slow you down.
[3411.86s -> 3416.06s]  So you say go to audio? My FPS are good. I don't like,
[3416.06s -> 3419.10s]  I haven't had, I've had stutters a little bit, but nothing terrible.
[3419.10s -> 3426.30s]  No. Put on it, put it on 5.1, 7.1?
[3426.30s -> 3431.56s]  Yeah. Okay. 7.1, 5.1. We'll give it a shot.
[3434.81s -> 3440.07s]  Someone mentioned the audio thing in critical's chat too. All right, we'll see.
[3440.07s -> 3442.63s]  That actually like kind of, that actually kind of worked.
[3443.51s -> 3451.96s]  I mean, it was, it was fine before, but wait a minute. Oh, this is the training thing.
[3453.88s -> 3460.55s]  Did you fight the bear? No, not yet. I'm going to do that. Oh, that's what this is. Yeah.
[3462.23s -> 3470.44s]  Okay. Bunging comet from reverse lunge. So you go wham, then you go wham.
[3470.44s -> 3477.98s]  DRG has a similar bug. It's with internal EQ. Okay. Interesting. So once I could charge this,
[3477.98s -> 3486.26s]  like faster, what was the charge button? I just did 795 damage.
[3486.26s -> 3492.42s]  What? Not a second. I was, we were, I was doing like three damages swing.
[3493.14s -> 3496.66s]  You just did 700 damage. Yeah. Yeah. I did a full charge
[3496.66s -> 3504.33s]  with the sword and I got that much damage. What? Okay. That's, that's interesting.
[3504.33s -> 3512.47s]  Oh, I see. Okay. With this weapon, I can charge and attack while I'm charging and then unleash
[3513.11s -> 3517.99s]  a 700 damage attack. Crazy. Absolutely insane damage.
[3518.71s -> 3520.95s]  Come under attack while in parry stance. Hold on.
[3524.15s -> 3532.89s]  I want to bring one of these little fellas with me. Is that working? Do I have to time it? Like
[3533.61s -> 3547.80s]  press LT next to the bear. Oh, deficient materials.
[3552.22s -> 3558.62s]  I need to parry it. Isn't that, it's not working. Parry successfully for big spin dance.
[3565.10s -> 3574.68s]  Oh, okay. So it's not, wait a minute. All right. It's not the top of the weapon. It's, I get it.
[3575.64s -> 3581.56s]  So during a box, you're right. Where are you? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just equipping stuff in a box.
[3582.28s -> 3587.64s]  So you parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, build up your gauge and then you've got ultra damage.
[3590.70s -> 3596.55s]  This is hard. This is, this is tricky. You probably chose like the most technical weapon
[3598.31s -> 3604.79s]  like by accident. This is now your thing. Okay. So during parry counter attack,
[3605.75s -> 3610.55s]  I'm not caught up with this one. I think I have to use them all. I have to use them all.
[3614.07s -> 3620.18s]  Oh shit. All right. Wait, wait, wait. I got a full gauge.
[3624.12s -> 3630.92s]  Vinny, why are you fondling that poor ball? Don't, do not incite ball fondler.
[3632.12s -> 3641.72s]  Do not like summon him. Whatever you do. Okay. I think I'm getting it down. Now how much damage
[3641.72s -> 3652.17s]  does it do? Nice. All right. Oh wow. I'm doing so much more damage to swing now. Mid dodge attack.
[3653.80s -> 3670.25s]  Nice. Okay. Oh, this really does just teach you all your combos. That's awesome. Yeah. All right. Oh
[3670.25s -> 3675.45s]  my God, dude. I was swinging and hitting the back of the bark on the back of that last enemy's back
[3676.01s -> 3680.01s]  and was doing one damage to swing. I'm doing like a hundred damage now.
[3681.88s -> 3692.26s]  Nice. I wonder if I was so useless in that last fight. Okay. Mount spring, then mid leap.
[3692.90s -> 3705.38s]  Great based attack. There's a lot of travel attacks. It seems like. Yeah. I just got to get
[3705.38s -> 3717.13s]  the parry down. Mount spring and then X mid leap. Wait, you can mount a spring. Oh, I see what it
[3717.13s -> 3726.38s]  means. Okay. So you have to like spring into the enemy and then attack. Cool. So I'm imagining that
[3727.18s -> 3732.78s]  chat helped me out here. When my gauge is higher, I do more damage. Obviously. I mean, obviously.
[3741.61s -> 3747.34s]  Nah. Cool. Yeah. Now it's like we both know how to play the game now. Yeah. So that's good.
[3747.34s -> 3759.16s]  You both got it down. Yeah. What about these little guys? Yeah. So I just upgraded that little dude.
[3759.16s -> 3765.16s]  I don't know what it does exactly, but you know, you can like, I think you can carry more stuff
[3765.88s -> 3772.04s]  for crates. That seemed to be like what happened. You lose the gauge very quick when taking damage
[3772.04s -> 3784.89s]  or not fighting anyone. Attack form? Jerma, there's food too, but you can, you can draw your meat
[3784.89s -> 3789.53s]  and then it'll like give you attack and health bonuses and stuff. I just learned.
[3791.62s -> 3804.76s]  Ooh, let's do it. Find out what creature made the roar. Ooh. Okay. Dry ingredients. Oh, this is what
[3804.76s -> 3813.37s]  you're talking about. Jerma, is this woman stuck in a box for you too? Whenever, whenever you're
[3813.37s -> 3823.24s]  over there. Um, I'll check it out in a sec. Yeah. Yeah. No rush. Cubed meat. I'm just drying a bunch
[3823.24s -> 3834.33s]  of meat. Luigi, I'm stuck in a little box. It's me, Mario. I need you to get me out of here.
[3834.33s -> 3840.15s]  I'm just drying meat. Mario, Mario, what are you doing in the box? I'm in the box too.
[3840.15s -> 3845.42s]  What are you doing in there? Get out of there. That's dangerous. Someone just said you're
[3845.42s -> 3853.03s]  embarrassing us. I mean, I'm embarrassing myself, not, not you, chat. No, no, no. I, I don't think
[3853.90s -> 3859.26s]  you, I did. You don't get embarrassed here. Do you understand the things that I've said? Yeah,
[3859.26s -> 3865.46s]  I know. I know. Yeah. Don't worry. We are all collectively weird here. Don't worry. Yes. That's,
[3865.46s -> 3869.99s]  that's fair. All right. Let's make, hold on. Let's make one of those. I'm going to make one of these
[3869.99s -> 3875.62s]  things and you're going to see how cool it is. Ready? Yeah. Check this shit out. Now, before you
[3875.62s -> 3880.42s]  do that, the Jerma, I have a, there's a sign over here that you can place. It was, it's, there's a
[3880.42s -> 3889.72s]  weird message on it. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Check this out. It's weird. Like I just read it. I was
[3889.72s -> 3894.52s]  like, how, how did that sign get there? Like, why does it say that this one? Let me investigate.
[3894.52s -> 3916.01s]  Hold on. Yeah. Right here. Yeah. All right. You want to go hunt a monster now? Really? Really?
[3916.65s -> 3923.96s]  I want to sponsor stream Vinny. All right. We need to make that a, speaking of sponsor,
[3923.96s -> 3929.69s]  thank you EA for sponsoring the stream. The game is out right now. It is wild hearts.
[3929.69s -> 3934.25s]  You can get it on PlayStation five, Xbox series X and series S as well as PC.
[3936.36s -> 3939.56s]  Those are the best times to possibly do that. If you're into the monster hunting
[3940.62s -> 3951.59s]  kind of lifestyle, this is potentially the game for you. Weirdly enough, that switching audio
[3951.59s -> 3956.87s]  thing actually increased my performance by quite a bit. I mean, I would say that what I'm looking at
[3956.87s -> 3962.31s]  right now, yeah, I would call, I would call it beautiful. Like a marginal difference. Yeah.
[3962.31s -> 3975.83s]  Really? During my sponsored stream? Really? Unbelievable. Oh my God. Vinny killed him.
[3976.63s -> 3983.13s]  I had to, had to. All right. So we wait. Oh shit. I forgot about, I, my, I wasted stuff.
[3984.34s -> 3987.30s]  All right. You ready Vinny? Check this out. Yeah. We're going to make this happen here.
[3988.02s -> 3993.51s]  Okay. I don't have enough resources. You need to make one. Make what? Oh, we need to tear that
[3993.51s -> 3998.47s]  down. Hold on. Come back over here. I'm just getting smacked by a goat, by a fantasy goat.
[3998.47s -> 4006.92s]  Hang on. Let's just take care of this. All right. I think we can only make a certain amount of
[4006.92s -> 4015.59s]  objects in. Correct. Yeah. Yes. So if we have too many, we should probably remove some, right?
[4016.63s -> 4028.54s]  Can I do that? So how do I? You can dismantle from the menu, I think. Oh wait. I don't know.
[4029.88s -> 4041.14s]  How do we do that? Cause it says, uh, dragon pit isn't powerful enough and see dragon pit capacity.
[4041.14s -> 4050.28s]  We're at kind of minus 13 right now for that or two old L one and press up. Oh, dismantle. There
[4050.28s -> 4059.29s]  it is. Yep. You press, you press the right stick in. I found another sign. It's weird. Another one.
[4061.62s -> 4065.54s]  Well, you got another sign. Let me see what's on it. No, no, no, no. You're no, you're good. You're
[4065.54s -> 4073.10s]  good. Not during your sponsored stream. Check this out. We are going to make a zip line from here to
[4073.10s -> 4078.30s]  there to the, to the mountain. Okay. Cause my zip line is placed in a very inconvenient area and I
[4078.30s -> 4082.62s]  think I'd have to go over to it and dismantle it. Okay. We have so much shit everywhere. I can't
[4082.62s -> 4094.92s]  feel it. Looks like we're walking. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. What if we, um, touch the dragon pit
[4094.92s -> 4102.25s]  here? Do you have a small mist crystal by chance? Do you still want to eat shit? No, no, no, no,
[4102.25s -> 4109.14s]  don't do that. Um, German over here. Can you, can you touch this dragon pit? Cause if you do that,
[4109.14s -> 4115.00s]  we can then build more stuff in this area. Only hosts can do that. Goddammit. Can you do it?
[4116.06s -> 4130.70s]  I can't because I'm missing a small mist crystal. Wait, maybe I have one. Small mist crystal.
[4130.70s -> 4136.23s]  Wait, this might be it right here. No, that's crystal ore. I have a shitload of them. Can I
[4136.23s -> 4142.68s]  give them to you? Open your crafting and hit right stick and you can dismantle the boxes.
[4142.68s -> 4150.26s]  All right. So if you do that, oh, wrong button. So if you do that right. Uh, and then you can make
[4150.26s -> 4158.12s]  it huge so you can just get rid of everything. All right. That's the least you can do that.
[4158.84s -> 4172.09s]  Wait, how do you dismiss? Oh, nice. Okay. Can you, can you, can you build the thing now? The,
[4172.09s -> 4177.53s]  the zip line? Like I'm really, I cannot really dedicate it to the zip line. I didn't know.
[4178.17s -> 4186.71s]  I cannot build it. I can build this other stuff though. So we only have, okay. So we have two
[4187.83s -> 4192.86s]  of that capacity on the top row. I think I honestly, I'm going to be honest with you. I
[4192.86s -> 4197.58s]  think I built like four of them when we were testing it. They're all in that place. I wonder
[4197.58s -> 4204.74s]  if I can do it from the, do we have to go dismantle them? Get rid of the poop sign. Someone said for
[4204.74s -> 4209.27s]  me to get rid of the poop sign. Okay. Or you might have to go back to the old one. All right. Let me
[4209.27s -> 4215.38s]  get rid of the poop sign. We'll try then. Oh, I got a small mist crystal. Hang on. I think that's
[4215.38s -> 4224.26s]  exactly what I needed. We need more leaps and purge. You can now conjure more dragon Karakuri
[4224.26s -> 4233.74s]  here. So now I think we can do it. Maybe. I think it's not quite. I think you only have two out of
[4233.74s -> 4238.97s]  a larger capacity. You don't have enough resources. All right. We just need to get resources. Let's,
[4238.97s -> 4243.61s]  let's try to get our way over there then a long way. We need one more. All right. Oh wait. No,
[4243.61s -> 4248.26s]  I can do it now. I can do it. Oh, you can. All right. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So now if you put
[4248.26s -> 4252.44s]  it here, can you just aim it to the top of that cliff and can we just ride it up? Yeah. I'm going
[4252.44s -> 4259.24s]  to try. There you go. So how do we make the zipline part? You know, you get on top of it and you fire
[4259.24s -> 4269.08s]  it wherever you want. I think it's a left trigger to activate it and then you aim it and you're
[4269.08s -> 4278.15s]  trying to get it there. And look at that. Oh my God. We did it. Why are you faster than me? You
[4278.15s -> 4285.46s]  shouldn't be faster than me. I don't know. That's not fair. I got on it first. I think I'm starting
[4285.46s -> 4289.30s]  to understand. So there is a, okay, so there's an object limit and me placing the poop sign
[4290.18s -> 4294.34s]  meant that we couldn't place other objects. I think that's what happened. All right. Use your
[4295.46s -> 4303.64s]  sense. Make sure there's nothing here. Where the hell are we? There's a document in here.
[4305.70s -> 4313.62s]  We went, where do we go? There's a lot of stuff here. Oh, this way. Oh, look. There it is. There
[4313.62s -> 4318.70s]  are all of our stupid things that we placed. You can see them? I can see them on the mini map,
[4318.70s -> 4325.69s]  like on the actual map map. Yeah. Well, it's all right. Like on the, on the map, like if you press
[4325.69s -> 4332.74s]  select, yeah, you can see where we, yeah, I see them. That's funny though that they're permanent.
[4332.74s -> 4339.13s]  All right. So now where is this monster? Find out what the creature made the roar.
[4341.42s -> 4345.18s]  I think if you hold your senses, we were being guided in this direction.
[4351.61s -> 4358.84s]  Do the roar. I landed on the ground with such force.
[4359.72s -> 4367.10s]  Jeremy, you're going to like the view up here. Okay. Good. Oh my God. Oh, we got a Pat raid.
[4367.82s -> 4379.88s]  What's up, Pat? Thank you. That was so violent. I want to be there too. It's not fair. You will be.
[4380.94s -> 4396.04s]  You will be. Warthog. We'll crush it. I mean, crush it. We will. How come,
[4396.04s -> 4398.76s]  why are people so afraid to have somebody with a funny voice as the main character?
[4402.28s -> 4406.73s]  Like Yoda? Yeah. I mean, just like, how come the main character in video games can't,
[4406.73s -> 4410.73s]  you know, talk like this? Why not? That's why we need more Muppet games.
[4411.53s -> 4415.05s]  True. Seriously, like Muppet Treasure Island was a great game and everyone had that voice.
[4419.40s -> 4421.80s]  Someone in my chat wrote, because cringe culture.
[4422.60s -> 4428.02s]  Cringe? I don't know. Funny voices is great. I made a career out of it.
[4428.58s -> 4433.67s]  Actually, you know what people, that would get annoying. Yeah. After a while. I mean,
[4433.67s -> 4439.03s]  but Mario has a funny voice. Someone just said, and like he goes, the whole game and we just get
[4439.03s -> 4446.15s]  used to it. But Mario is not, Mario, you know, going like, yahoo. He's not going like, yahoo.
[4446.15s -> 4450.71s]  And by the way, let us talk about current political landscape. Like it doesn't really,
[4451.67s -> 4457.59s]  it doesn't really talk that way. Luigi does that. Luigi's like, oh Mario, we're going to yeet that
[4457.59s -> 4464.42s]  meat. You know, I actually really, I like that voice. I don't think I would have a problem with
[4464.42s -> 4468.98s]  that voice. I wouldn't either, you know, we're going to make it the pasta, the pizza.
[4470.84s -> 4474.26s]  Snow covers summer pastures. I like that voice.
[4474.26s -> 4478.90s]  So if we let that Kingdust think this is its patch. I don't suppose.
[4478.90s -> 4484.18s]  Charles Martinet actually talked to people, like as Mario, like he can hold like full
[4484.18s -> 4489.10s]  conversations with people as Mario. What an absolute saint of a person, by the way.
[4489.10s -> 4494.62s]  Yeah. He's a champ. He's awesome. I met him once and he was like, it was a long convention.
[4494.62s -> 4497.18s]  Really? He was signing for days and days and days,
[4497.18s -> 4502.06s]  like all three days. And I met him at the very end of a day. We were both tired,
[4502.06s -> 4505.98s]  but he was way tired. You could hear his voice was just tired and he was still doing the voices
[4505.98s -> 4511.83s]  for me while he was signing my photo. He was like, wahoo. It's me, Mario. And he just signed and
[4511.83s -> 4516.71s]  drew pictures all over it. And he was so nice to me. And I was like, Charles, thank you. You just,
[4516.71s -> 4521.77s]  you just made my day. You just made my month. Really sweet guy.
[4521.77s -> 4527.53s]  All right. We can use the tower search. Oh, that's what this does. All right. So if it's
[4527.53s -> 4532.01s]  in the area, if you put down one of these towers, that's how it's being illuminated
[4532.01s -> 4538.42s]  through the walls. And if we use flying, it's as flying vine, we can do surprise attacks.
[4538.42s -> 4542.15s]  Yeah. No, he just seems like a really, really swell guy.
[4543.62s -> 4548.26s]  Yeah. He's good. Good, good lad. So how do you want to handle this? You want to do a zipline?
[4549.70s -> 4555.22s]  Do we have enough points to do it? I'm going to see if we can make one, but I see a little
[4556.18s -> 4566.01s]  Jerma. Yeah. Jerma, can you get over here? Yep. All right. Nevermind. You know what?
[4567.05s -> 4573.91s]  Probably wouldn't be good for your sponsorship. But, but here, can you, can you follow, follow me?
[4579.50s -> 4585.88s]  That was pretty fucking cool. I'm not going to lie. Okay. All right. I'm just,
[4585.88s -> 4588.04s]  Hey, name me, name me another game where you could do something like that.
[4591.18s -> 4597.48s]  Good point. I can't write the second. Good point. Someone said Sonic 06.
[4597.56s -> 4606.46s]  That was pretty pog to me. Skyrim. All right. All right. Yeah. Well, we can zipline that dude.
[4606.46s -> 4612.39s]  Let's do it. Let's, let's go for it. All right. Hang on. Let me see if I can do
[4612.39s -> 4616.23s]  a zipline. Can I just jump? I cannot. I don't have enough resources.
[4617.03s -> 4622.31s]  We, unfortunately we might need to go and like dismantle these like useless.
[4622.31s -> 4631.03s]  I made two or three of them in the same place. Let's see. Dragon pit isn't powerful enough.
[4631.59s -> 4639.64s]  Oh, hang on, hang on. Before we give up, let me look for, there's, there's a thing.
[4640.28s -> 4646.01s]  There's an item you can get and then you can increase the, the amount of stuff you can place.
[4646.01s -> 4652.01s]  Yeah. Those little pits with the purple, with the dragon pits. I think we need more of them.
[4652.01s -> 4655.45s]  There's one down here. Is that the one we already got? So there's one over here,
[4655.45s -> 4660.31s]  but I can't upgrade it because I don't have the material for it. Yeah. The collision.
[4661.03s -> 4665.51s]  I don't know what's going on. Look, I'm looking. Is this actually an open world game? Can you just
[4665.51s -> 4671.19s]  climb that stuff in the distance? I think that's accurate. I'm pretty sure it's just like a big
[4671.19s -> 4678.36s]  open map. I think that's accurate. I think we can just kind of go up pretty much anywhere we want.
[4679.24s -> 4686.20s]  Or maybe it's different areas that load up. You can even go into the sky. Oh, I found, oh wait
[4686.20s -> 4690.84s]  now I found a core stone. Um, I mean, I guess we could just go down there and kill the thing.
[4691.48s -> 4695.24s]  Is there, I wonder if we can like dismantle things in the, on the map or something.
[4695.80s -> 4698.76s]  We could just go down there. Can you dismantle things from the, from the map?
[4699.56s -> 4711.03s]  Let's just, I'm going to, let's head down there. All right. Just don't fall too far. Oh, I'm alive.
[4711.96s -> 4717.06s]  I'm good. That hurt a lot, but I'm good. Huh. I didn't take any damage from that.
[4718.97s -> 4724.30s]  It's probably a, all right. That he's like right here. All right. Everything we learned,
[4724.30s -> 4728.70s]  everything we trained. It's time to kill this thing. Okay. Wait, dismantle this shit.
[4730.71s -> 4737.83s]  Oh, so, so you, uh, here's how you do it. Um, right stick. So, so go into the thing and then
[4737.83s -> 4744.10s]  right stick, click in and then you can dismantle. I think we, it has to, oh, here's another one of
[4744.10s -> 4754.07s]  these. Activate this thing. We need extra materials. Were you able to activate it? No.
[4754.07s -> 4759.37s]  No, the host has to. Okay. That's so weird that only I can do it. I guess it is my game world,
[4759.37s -> 4766.47s]  right? Following your game world, but yeah, I think that's probably why we sneak over. Yeah.
[4766.47s -> 4772.82s]  I don't have the materials. Someone said I have both yours and German streams open at once.
[4773.46s -> 4779.54s]  That's a good lead. That's pretty, that's pretty cool. Yeah. Are you ready? Yeah. Let's, let's put
[4779.54s -> 4784.01s]  some shit around the area. You know what I mean? Like I'm going to put a spring over here, like
[4784.01s -> 4788.01s]  maybe have springs all around so we can kind of keep the monster the same, you know, put springs
[4788.01s -> 4798.55s]  around boxes. I got springs. Okay. Got a bunch of springs. Okay. All right. Are we, are we ready?
[4798.55s -> 4812.07s]  I'm going to aggro. Whoa, it's Roar just knocked me back. This is a two star monster. Are we in
[4812.07s -> 4819.02s]  trouble here? We could seek assistance. I guess that's like health from randos. Shit, he almost
[4819.02s -> 4838.06s]  killed me in one hit. We're going to go hog wild. I got to get this parry down. Oh my God. And here
[4838.06s -> 4855.03s]  we shit. Yeah, this is a problem. This thing is huge. It's very big. Look at the eyes. All of my
[4855.03s -> 4861.30s]  tactics. There's so many eyes. Oh yeah. Oh God. It's got a lot of eyes. Oh, I don't like that.
[4861.30s -> 4881.13s]  That's so weird. Back legs. Back legs seem to be vulnerable. That one did. It's a tree out of the
[4881.13s -> 4889.78s]  way. We're good. Don't chat. Don't worry. We're going to put the squeeze on this hog. What? Unleash
[4889.78s -> 4914.76s]  unleash a little bit. Got a little bit. Oh, there it is. I got one. Careful. This weapon is definitely
[4914.76s -> 4922.30s]  for like for a master. It's not me. Yeah. I mean, I'm even struggling with this big sword.
[4923.26s -> 4936.90s]  So I was dammit. There you go. I did some damage there. If you knew the monster patterns. Yeah.
[4937.86s -> 4943.62s]  I think this thing is higher level than us, but we'll pay. How do you enjoy monster hunter?
[4943.62s -> 4952.74s]  I've played a lot of monster hunter. Try three you for world rise. Sorry to just list my
[4952.74s -> 4960.54s]  credentials, but no, it's true. I played a lot, but I don't get like I play like 100 hours of
[4960.54s -> 4970.49s]  each game. And then I just after that I'm good. And that's like no small amount for me. Gamer
[4970.49s -> 4976.82s]  resume. Exactly. I got it. I'm going to try to get a Perry. It's like a whack. Nope. All right.
[4976.82s -> 4998.10s]  That's a long swing. That's a very long swing. I might have to go mall. I might have to start
[4998.90s -> 5003.70s]  some materials. Don't forget you can attack and charge. Oh no, I know. But then the hog attacks
[5003.70s -> 5015.50s]  me. And then I end up kind of like losing the combo. He's running LB. What's going on right now?
[5016.84s -> 5025.19s]  Wait, what? What did I just do? What did you blow? What the fuck did I just do? What did you do?
[5025.19s -> 5034.18s]  Holy shit. I don't know. I had I went like instinct mode and I made a bulwark, a bulwark
[5034.18s -> 5040.12s]  fusion. Cowra Courage is flashed into existence. I think that's the play for this one.
[5040.84s -> 5046.84s]  Bulwarks can fend off charging kimono use a fusion of how two rows of free crates.
[5048.81s -> 5058.66s]  All right. Oh, you're down. Yeah. Perry, you can. Oh my God.
[5065.91s -> 5070.71s]  I tried. I think we're dead. No, no, no. You got this. No, I'm dead. All right.
[5071.59s -> 5078.44s]  I think this thing is this thing is a little more difficult. So we have three tries, it seems. So
[5078.44s -> 5086.46s]  retreat. Yeah, we have to retreat and then I think run back. Oh, I'm gonna grab some of this water.
[5088.86s -> 5102.20s]  Revival point. Yes, definitely do get. Hold on. Do we have your meat dry? It dried. I got it. I
[5102.20s -> 5111.40s]  don't know what else to do with it. Oh, I did. I don't think I tried it properly. I'm going to try
[5111.40s -> 5123.99s]  to let me try the other weapon. How do you eat the meat? Do you know? Or was it like auto eat
[5123.99s -> 5137.93s]  meat? I don't think I'm going to go this way. You should upgrade your gear. I don't know if I can
[5137.93s -> 5146.79s]  right now. Like we don't have enough materials to really upgrade gear left on D pad to eat meat.
[5146.79s -> 5153.43s]  Oh, it is that. OK. All right. Let me let me just real quick. I just want to mess around with the
[5153.43s -> 5166.86s]  mall. This thing is OK. While you do that, I'm going to do. Oh my God, it's huge. It's got like
[5166.86s -> 5170.79s]  a small handle, too. I feel like this would be hard to handle. All right. Let me try it.
[5171.35s -> 5177.05s]  Have you heard about stream squad? It makes it easier for people to watch your stream when
[5177.05s -> 5184.04s]  you're playing with friends. No, I didn't know about that really. Jumping smash. Nice.
[5188.68s -> 5193.88s]  You're trying to fight one of if not the last boss of the map. You skipped all the one star fights
[5195.16s -> 5199.56s]  as a chat member. I don't know how true that is, but it feels true. That felt hard.
[5206.87s -> 5223.34s]  All right. This is this is way cooler. Stended mall held. You went straight to Ganon. Yeah,
[5223.34s -> 5235.77s]  pretty much. There's also another Rage Tale. Oh, you can see. OK, because the towers we build
[5235.77s -> 5245.40s]  have like radius of like where the monsters are. So, yeah, we. So wait, this is a little explosion.
[5246.73s -> 5253.61s]  Is that what it does to this boss? You switch to Minato map. The NPCs are looking for its entire
[5253.61s -> 5276.28s]  village. Oh, yeah, it's a telescoping handle. X, R, T, X, R, T, X, R, T, X, R, T. Come to work.
[5277.48s -> 5282.65s]  Here. You know what? You do that and I'm going to deconstruct all this crap that I built.
[5283.61s -> 5293.19s]  There we go. Jesus. I suggest doing this boss since you pick up side quests at the village
[5293.19s -> 5308.49s]  after this boss. I mean, if we can, we're going to try. You got to get this down. So it's like you
[5308.49s -> 5314.95s]  smash, then you press right trigger, then you press it again, right trigger and you press it again.
[5319.48s -> 5324.95s]  Instant extend power smash. All right, that one's way cooler.
[5324.95s -> 5336.41s]  Yeah, I'm just going to go resource gathering while Jerma is learning the hammer.
[5337.21s -> 5349.27s]  Feel like I'm going to like it. All right, I think I'm ready. So what else do we have?
[5350.09s -> 5356.49s]  We've got King Tusk. We've got King Tusk and that rat again, which could be good to upgrade our
[5356.49s -> 5363.02s]  stuff. But I mean, it's up to you. Do you want to go for the rat and then come back to the King Tusk?
[5363.34s -> 5373.06s]  Yeah, let's let's do some resource gathering. Let's actually I'm going to go destroy all this
[5373.06s -> 5379.06s]  shit that I made over here. OK, I'll be back in two seconds. Yeah, take your time. I found the rat,
[5379.06s -> 5389.42s]  so I'll just be there. I'm going to go delete that stuff because it's just it's sucking up resources.
[5389.98s -> 5402.97s]  It's the fastest way to get there. I think fast travel only works to camp, but yeah,
[5402.97s -> 5408.06s]  we'd have to like make a bunch of ziplines. It's definitely worth me going and getting rid of them.
[5408.06s -> 5416.09s]  But I think that's only per area, like I'm almost positive it's a per area thing.
[5416.73s -> 5423.69s]  And then like you can just go to a new area and build more, but you need to upgrade the limit.
[5423.69s -> 5433.48s]  Chat members, can you confirm this? I think that's accurate. It seems like it's accurate.
[5435.51s -> 5441.82s]  Something just screamed at me. I don't know what it was. Oh, I found a new ball. New ball just
[5441.82s -> 5456.04s]  dropped almost there. You need your pits upgraded. That sounds weird when you type it like that,
[5456.04s -> 5462.04s]  but I know what you're talking about. Oh my God, I fell. This is probably a better way to do this,
[5462.04s -> 5470.30s]  but it's going to be more mindful of it. Dude, can you seriously climb this? Oh, what am I doing? I
[5470.30s -> 5477.54s]  have boxes can help. Yeah, that's right. We just had the same issue and I had to build boxes the
[5477.54s -> 5492.89s]  same time you did. I'm going to get a different area of the map. All right. Bounce, bounce, please.
[5493.53s -> 5503.00s]  Bounce, please. It doesn't rock and whatever. I think we talked about this, but you're not going
[5503.00s -> 5510.38s]  to Boston for PAX, right? I am not. OK, right. I think we did talk about that. Sorry. Yeah,
[5510.38s -> 5515.42s]  I haven't really been to very many conventions or meetups or anything like that in a while.
[5516.14s -> 5527.53s]  Yeah. I'm going to kill this frog. What about TwitchCon in Vegas? Says someone. I mean, that's
[5527.53s -> 5533.29s]  here. Yeah, that's close to you. I considered that one. I haven't been to the West Coast or
[5533.29s -> 5539.45s]  the Middle Coast very much at all ever. The problem I have with that is last year it was
[5539.45s -> 5545.05s]  the same time as Comic Con. And I like I like going to New York Comic Con. So I just went there
[5545.05s -> 5554.70s]  instead. I'm going the right way. I think I am. Yeah, I'm picking up a bunch of resources to just
[5554.70s -> 5561.93s]  anything I can find. Yeah, me too. Like I already found another upgrade area. Vinny, there's no
[5561.93s -> 5567.29s]  coast in the middle. Yeah, it's just a bunch of fields. But like if you go south, there's like
[5567.29s -> 5575.50s]  the Gulf of Mexico. No, I got a snail. Oh, that's the Gulf Coast. All right. I'm almost there.
[5576.63s -> 5585.96s]  Don't fall, please. Why did I not make the thing? I'm good. How do I get up here?
[5592.66s -> 5599.80s]  Vinny, wrong direction. Well, how do you know where I'm going? I don't know where I'm going.
[5599.80s -> 5605.90s]  Actually, I'm looking for a rat. Have you seen a rat anywhere? I am. Where is the rat? Oh,
[5605.90s -> 5612.60s]  I found the rat. Oh, you're right. The pink icon. Oh, shit. All right. I'm coming in a minute.
[5612.60s -> 5629.40s]  I'm going to teleport back to the camp and I'll meet you there. Crystals. All right. Where are
[5629.40s -> 5638.78s]  they? They're like behind me. I hope I'm going the right way. Yeah, this is definitely the right way.
[5645.54s -> 5651.62s]  I have initiated rat fight. I am about to initiate the one we just did. Hold on. No,
[5651.62s -> 5661.32s]  let me just delete this stuff. Don't fight me. Please don't hurt me. I just want to get. Oh,
[5668.28s -> 5679.46s]  all right. Here's one. Here they are. Good, good, good, good. Oh, get off me. All right.
[5679.46s -> 5684.98s]  I think this one's not mine. Isn't it, though? Can you not deconstruct it? Oh, yeah. There we
[5684.98s -> 5693.66s]  go. All right. Did that free anything up? Can you look at your menu? Uh, it might. But again,
[5693.66s -> 5697.98s]  I think it's since it's per area, I think it's it should be OK. Wherever wherever I am, I think
[5697.98s -> 5703.80s]  is different. I'm not sure. But it might also be a limit on like the zip lines. Like, I don't know
[5704.36s -> 5708.52s]  I don't know how this game works. I don't know. I it definitely is per area because I just deleted
[5708.52s -> 5716.46s]  them in there still there. It's definitely. All right. I'm coming to you. Yeah, I'm wailing on
[5716.46s -> 5730.10s]  the rat. It's going great. I can figure out how you got there. How did you get over there?
[5730.10s -> 5740.90s]  Oh, I got to go this way. You take a bite out of a bar of soap on screen. No. What? It's kind of
[5740.90s -> 5745.06s]  unhinged. Why? Why? Why are people like, oh, yeah, yeah, that'd be so awesome if you did that.
[5745.78s -> 5752.18s]  Oh, man, I hope you eat soap on it. Why would I eat soap for no reason? No, it's a good bit,
[5752.18s -> 5757.37s]  streamer. Trust me. Actually, I've eaten soap at least three times before I got here today.
[5757.37s -> 5762.57s]  All right. I need to go back to the road. You're going to kill that thing before I even get there.
[5763.53s -> 5766.97s]  Chat, I won't even face cam. What makes you think I'm going to eat soap?
[5766.97s -> 5785.27s]  And then it's to the left, right? OK, here we go. I was so close to unleashing my fury upon this rat.
[5785.91s -> 5796.46s]  Am I going the right way? As long as I get the finishing blow, that's all I care about.
[5797.40s -> 5800.44s]  You know what I noticed? You don't have to sharpen your weapons.
[5801.24s -> 5810.07s]  No. That is a great thing to not have to do. I get why that's in the other series,
[5811.03s -> 5817.66s]  but it's kind of nice to just fight and not think about it. OK, I'm still trying to find you.
[5818.38s -> 5829.74s]  I think I can go this way. I can't eat anything at the moment.
[5829.74s -> 5844.76s]  No, I see your name. I see the chef. OK, I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.
[5844.76s -> 5861.27s]  OK, good. Good. Good. I'm almost there. I'm 200 miles away. I'm almost there. Oh, no. Oh,
[5861.27s -> 5866.39s]  no, no, no, rat. Don't don't do it. I'm getting there. Can you see me?
[5867.03s -> 5885.21s]  I think I can see. Was that you? I see you. I see you. All right. What's up? Yeah. Help me
[5885.21s -> 5893.38s]  fight this rat. And then like we can use rat materials to further upgrade our weapons.
[5893.38s -> 5900.02s]  It's going to be fucking awesome. Oh, there's a ball here. Oh, germ germ ball ball ball to be
[5900.02s -> 5917.19s]  friend. Oh, I got one. All right. Rat. I like this town. Pretty cool. Looks good.
[5918.76s -> 5933.90s]  How do we get over there? OK, now that was way more damage than I've ever done. Nice.
[5934.70s -> 5944.36s]  And unleash the fucking fury upon the rat. Oh, my God. 500 damage.
[5945.32s -> 5966.49s]  I think it's kind of like trapped in here, too. Might be. Right in the head.
[5967.53s -> 5978.34s]  Oh, man. Did it run out? I lost it. I lost the charge. I think there's a material here. Yep.
[5983.11s -> 5991.06s]  Got it. Cool. I'm enjoying this, actually. I think it's pretty good.
[5991.86s -> 5995.98s]  Yeah, I think just learning how to how the mechanics work, I think are important.
[5997.02s -> 6003.18s]  Yeah, like they're going for the like the box stuff. I get what they're doing. Like the same
[6003.18s -> 6008.14s]  way in like rise, you can like use your bug to like go to the sky and then do an attack.
[6008.14s -> 6014.54s]  This you just build boxes like it's once you figure out the combos and dodging, it makes sense.
[6015.58s -> 6021.16s]  All right. This thing is inside of this room now. You know what? Yeah, fuck it. Let's you know,
[6021.16s -> 6027.66s]  speaking of that. Oh, that would have been so awesome. You all know what I actually landed.
[6028.86s -> 6036.52s]  Why is there a little possum down here? See that little possum friend? I think this might be
[6037.16s -> 6051.88s]  the same species. I don't know. It looks like a little fella. Oh, again. Again. Stop running.
[6051.88s -> 6064.15s]  It's dead. Fucking dead now. Oh, that felt good. It's all about using the springs and stuff.
[6066.23s -> 6081.69s]  Yeah, I got to start building more springs. Let's see. Oh, nice.
[6082.41s -> 6095.69s]  Oh, do it, please. Again. Oh, man. I had so many opportunities. I just screwed up. Yeah,
[6095.69s -> 6106.47s]  I'm not doing the combos very well. It's like this swing. It's right trigger. Swing, right trigger.
[6106.47s -> 6110.07s]  Swing, right trigger. This little fella part of your vocabulary now. That's been a part of
[6110.07s -> 6114.63s]  my vocabulary for like the past decade. That's like a Carl Pilkington thing that I've just like
[6114.63s -> 6127.45s]  said for years. Get some monkey news up in here. Little monkey news. Little fella.
[6128.33s -> 6136.49s]  A hundred damage. Very mad. Very dead, I think. Very dead. Very dead. Nice.
[6140.46s -> 6149.29s]  Carve it. Yeah, I always have a problem in monster hunting games like this,
[6150.17s -> 6154.09s]  because I don't know what to play with. I always go, no, no, something else.
[6154.09s -> 6157.05s]  Then I change and I have to relearn the whole thing. And then I go, no, something else.
[6157.13s -> 6160.89s]  And I have to relearn the whole thing. Ah, something else. You end up sticking with something,
[6160.89s -> 6166.65s]  though. Yeah, like I said, I have like my two, but even then I forget like which one I'm using.
[6167.21s -> 6172.57s]  And then I'm like, oh, I'm pressing the wrong buttons. Sorry, I couldn't escape. I couldn't
[6172.57s -> 6176.65s]  go anywhere. Good. That was a good sneeze. It was like a powerful sneeze. I like got out of the
[6176.65s -> 6186.87s]  chair. All right. Maybe we should make some armor. Yes. I like that idea. I'm going to teleport back
[6186.87s -> 6195.11s]  to camp, I think. Vinnie, your duck sneeze. Yeah, I do a duck sneeze. People like that.
[6195.11s -> 6200.70s]  I just sound like a duck when I sneeze. I'm like, people like, do you do that in public?
[6200.70s -> 6210.18s]  And my answer is I fucking try not to. Wait, we discovered it. We discovered one.
[6210.90s -> 6220.17s]  Target kimono discovered. Oh, I see. OK. So I wonder, do you see these grayed out things?
[6221.72s -> 6227.82s]  Yeah, those are camps or the dragon thing. Yeah, I think those are the ones that I've upgraded
[6227.90s -> 6234.42s]  the pits. So we got to like, yeah, if we go to those and upgrade them, we can place more garbage.
[6234.42s -> 6242.62s]  Yeah. Oh, I can actually do it from here. Really? Yeah. Yeah, I just upgraded one.
[6242.62s -> 6252.90s]  You have to like actually see it first and then you can upgrade it. Paddle scoop. Oh,
[6252.90s -> 6271.82s]  this is an automatic fish catcher. Let me see if I can upgrade something. Upgraded. I got a new
[6271.82s -> 6286.84s]  thing. It's like, oh, OK, I can do this. It's an ornamental lantern. I think I'm going this way.
[6286.84s -> 6292.44s]  Oh, Jerma, collect this food when you get a chance. The dried out food. And if you press
[6292.44s -> 6295.64s]  left on the D pad, you can use it before we fight and it'll give you a boost.
[6296.63s -> 6303.88s]  There's also inherited skills here. I'm like putting that on. Interesting. What do you mean?
[6303.88s -> 6307.16s]  Where's that? When you go into your weapon upgrades, you can kind of take inherited
[6307.16s -> 6314.63s]  skills from the thing you just had. OK, that's interesting. This thing's way cooler. My magma
[6314.63s -> 6331.37s]  hammer. Nice. I need one more Rage Tale thing and then I can get the better sword. Damn it.
[6331.93s -> 6341.32s]  All right. I think I got this combo down. Bang, whack, bang, whack, and then wham.
[6341.32s -> 6347.64s]  Which one's bang and which one's whack? Bang is X, whack is right trigger. OK.
[6352.06s -> 6358.15s]  Health boost. Oh, this armor has a health boost. Are you going to play anything else today or just
[6358.15s -> 6369.45s]  this? I think in a little bit I'll play something else. Maybe we'll see. Dark and darker ended,
[6369.45s -> 6378.39s]  right? Yes, it did. I needed that to end because my productivity was dipping anyway. I'll wait
[6378.39s -> 6381.99s]  like another month and a half and I'll be happy with that. That's fine. We could go kill that
[6381.99s -> 6389.82s]  sap scourge again if you want to. Which one's that? That's the fire one that was burning
[6389.82s -> 6398.23s]  like the whole forest down. Oh, the sap scourge. Gotcha. Yeah, yeah. We could do that. We could
[6398.79s -> 6405.43s]  just go like explore and find things to hunt. I'm fine with that too. You know what? We could go
[6405.43s -> 6412.71s]  like here, like that blue icon or the purple one and we can build a tower and just see what's out
[6412.71s -> 6429.99s]  there. I'm into it. Let's go. Why did I not do that? Wild hearts. I feel like I'm going to be
[6429.99s -> 6443.42s]  way happier with this weapon. Where's our thing that we placed? We got like a... I destroyed a
[6443.42s -> 6452.84s]  couple of things. Do you want to just kind of explore? Yeah, maybe we'll explore it and we'll
[6452.84s -> 6459.51s]  find... we'll go this way and maybe and then we'll just like... We'll probably run into something.
[6460.07s -> 6466.47s]  Yeah, we'll run into something. I'll build a tower. Have you told Jerma about your pet owl yet?
[6466.47s -> 6471.43s]  What is this pet owl stuff that people keep... What are you talking about? You got a pet owl?
[6472.23s -> 6479.58s]  No. It's the owl's name. Flanko from the New York Zoo. Oh, right. Yeah, because there was an owl
[6479.58s -> 6484.30s]  that escaped from the Central Park Zoo and he's just chilling in Central Park and like eating rats.
[6484.30s -> 6497.69s]  What? Yeah. I can't wait to just magma smash. Not fair. I'm heavier than you.
[6498.33s -> 6506.04s]  I'm heavier than you. Not fair. Oh, we went... Oh, we can go up and around, I guess.
[6506.68s -> 6512.23s]  Vinny, tell him about the female owl plan. All right. Well, Jeremy, I don't know if you're
[6512.23s -> 6519.14s]  interested in this information, but in order to catch the owl... No. No? All right.
[6523.11s -> 6530.25s]  No. No, I'm just fucking around. What is it? Oh, ball here. Ball. Ball. In order to catch the owl,
[6531.78s -> 6536.98s]  they're putting a female owl of the same species in like a little like cage and they're just going
[6536.98s -> 6541.86s]  to like dangle it in front of the owl and hope it goes into the cage. What? I'm not even kidding.
[6542.90s -> 6546.26s]  Like that's how they're going to catch the owl. That's the plan. Yeah, that's the plan.
[6546.98s -> 6556.57s]  Uh-huh. What kind of plan is that? That's a good one. Hopefully it works. I hope they catch that
[6556.57s -> 6563.14s]  owl. I read that and I was like, wait, no, that can't be real. That's like Bugs Bunny shit. I was
[6563.14s -> 6568.42s]  going to say that that's some like Looney Tunes level of... I guess it's just put this here and
[6570.46s -> 6580.17s]  hope it works. If it goes for it. That's it. I like the slide. All right. So we are down here.
[6580.17s -> 6593.70s]  Maybe put a beacon up over here somewhere. Um, let us... What's that? Um, what's that creature
[6593.70s -> 6599.54s]  over there? I think that's the King Tusk again. Yeah. Okay. Let's go this way and we'll place one.
[6600.18s -> 6607.98s]  I'm just picking up every single thing I see. Oh, this is the one I made earlier.
[6607.98s -> 6620.28s]  This is the useless one. Oh, yeah, that's right. Tom literally did that to Jerry. Oh, the plan.
[6620.28s -> 6634.90s]  Yeah. Oh, we can upgrade this. Okay. You can now conjure more dragon something, something here.
[6634.90s -> 6640.58s]  Okay. Oh, yeah, we know. Yeah, we can. Oh, wow. That's way more. We had like two before. It's 59
[6640.58s -> 6653.11s]  now. Holy shit. That's so much better. It's good. Um, we can go. Let's see. Yeah, let's, let's go
[6653.11s -> 6658.01s]  over this way. I'm going to build a tower and we'll, uh, we'll see if there's any monsters
[6658.09s -> 6665.50s]  chilling. Has it got a squirrel? It's always monster hunter, but what about monster chilling?
[6665.50s -> 6671.45s]  Like, like, why can't I just hang out? I think that's what we're doing right now.
[6671.45s -> 6678.62s]  All right. Let's see if we can find something. Uh, I can't build it because it,
[6678.62s -> 6686.50s]  your dragon pit isn't powerful enough. Let me, you know what? Let me just head back this way and see.
[6688.07s -> 6692.15s]  I think we're like out of the zone. If you look at the map, see the map,
[6692.15s -> 6699.00s]  maybe we have to be in those zones. I think that makes sense. Yeah. Let me, let me get closer to
[6699.00s -> 6708.18s]  this. If you sneak up on wild animals, you can pet them and get free resources. Oh, you actually
[6708.18s -> 6716.22s]  can pet the animals. You can? What? You just like changed Jerma's life. Thanks chat member.
[6716.22s -> 6727.14s]  I want to do that. Uh, no, I can't place this here. It still says the dragon pit isn't powerful
[6727.14s -> 6737.86s]  enough. It's weird. All right. We can just go kill that pig. That's why I want to keep exploring up
[6737.86s -> 6751.75s]  here. Let's go up here and then we'll loop around and if we don't see anything, we'll kill a pig.
[6751.75s -> 6757.56s]  Yeah. I think the, the issue is that because you're the host, it's technically your game.
[6758.78s -> 6765.77s]  So I can't interact with those. It's just so, so weird. I get it, but it's also really weird
[6765.77s -> 6771.48s]  and not, not really anything in here. Nothing that I saw. Oh, there's a cool rock break.
[6772.28s -> 6781.61s]  Yeah. There's rocks to break. Yeah. Um, this game, please. You are so close to getting it.
[6781.61s -> 6787.30s]  You are. Just keep up the good behavior. Jerma chat. Keep up the good behavior.
[6787.94s -> 6796.76s]  I think we got a lot more damage too. I, I'm, I now I'm not doing like four damage total,
[6796.76s -> 6804.17s]  the whole encounter. Cool. So I'm down. I mean, we can loop back around this way and try to get
[6804.17s -> 6815.38s]  to the hog again. Down for that. Uh, where did you go? You're there. What percentage still face cam
[6815.38s -> 6824.25s]  you're at like 92%. Your other towers are overlapping. Well, that would make sense.
[6824.89s -> 6833.27s]  This is a cool looking area. Yeah, this is cool. Yeah. I think,
[6833.27s -> 6837.03s]  I think the chat member is right though. Like I built too many towers too close and,
[6837.03s -> 6846.62s]  Oh, yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Can you pet the snail? Wait, I need to see if this is real.
[6852.17s -> 6856.97s]  It's real. Holy shit. I just pet this weird tree creature of, of whom it's family. We've
[6856.97s -> 6862.98s]  probably killed a couple of times. How do you do it? So you press the dodge button while standing
[6862.98s -> 6870.42s]  still to crouch and like go stealth. And then when you get close to the creature and then you
[6870.42s -> 6875.06s]  just pet them, it'll show you the button. I think I accidentally angered this thing.
[6876.42s -> 6895.61s]  I hit it right in the fucking head. Yeah. It's too late to pet it. It's angry. I mean,
[6895.61s -> 6902.68s]  I guess that's angry. It looks angry. Well, it's angry at me, not you. All right. All right.
[6903.32s -> 6911.75s]  All right. Oh, I feel so bad. I have to leave. It's just this weird little hop.
[6912.71s -> 6917.43s]  Listen, don't look, don't look, Jerma. I got this. Oh, what is he doing? What are you doing?
[6919.10s -> 6924.63s]  Vinny, quick question. What's your favorite oil? Don't answer that. That's somebody from yesterday.
[6926.15s -> 6934.71s]  What? I mean, you can answer it. I'm curious. Okay. A light olive oil to cook with or are
[6934.71s -> 6941.40s]  you talking about like like essential oils? Because I like like lemongrass. It was a very,
[6941.40s -> 6945.72s]  it was a very vague question yesterday and I gave pretty similar answers. So
[6946.44s -> 6951.90s]  are you ready for the pig? Yeah, I'm ready. We're prepared. We're upgraded. Wait, I suppose.
[6952.62s -> 6962.30s]  I wanted to pet that. Okay. It's not going to aggro until we attack it. Okay. I'm sorry. I was
[6962.30s -> 6972.06s]  just collecting a ball. We've had the big monster. That'd be kind of funny. Yeah. Your chat is
[6972.06s -> 6976.46s]  bleeding into mine because now they're saying honest to goodness. Let's hunt like they're just
[6976.46s -> 6982.36s]  they're just like, I think we focus people saying focus on one of the legs. Let's focus on the back
[6982.36s -> 6992.38s]  left leg. Okay. It's a good idea. Sure. All right. I'm gonna I'm gonna engage in three, two, one.
[6994.89s -> 7013.18s]  Let's go loud. My goodness. 120 damage dude. I was so useless up until about 15 seconds ago.
[7019.69s -> 7028.07s]  Nice. Nice. Nice. Get that damage. Nice. Wait, build the build the bulwark. Oh, I built it.
[7028.07s -> 7049.42s]  Don't walk up. Okay, that was weird. It fucking worked. It did. I have a bulwark over here. No,
[7049.42s -> 7065.11s]  yeah, I do. Oh, I'm over here. Get him to run into this. Come and get me. Pumped his head.
[7065.75s -> 7092.71s]  Oh, what? Get that damage. Get the tail. 400 damage. One, two. God damn it. That would have
[7092.71s -> 7098.79s]  been awesome. Yeah, same. I also at the exact same time missed my big attack. All right.
[7101.19s -> 7104.47s]  At least we're doing damage and we know how to like play the game and stuff.
[7108.68s -> 7113.40s]  Vinny, have you noticed that this hog has jiggle physics in its ass? Mods. Mods.
[7113.80s -> 7130.57s]  Please remove this delinquents. Where did he go? I don't know. He's gone. I don't see him on the
[7130.57s -> 7146.86s]  map. Oh, wait. No. Yeah. He's at the blue. Go to the blue. There it is. All right. Re-engaging.
[7147.58s -> 7169.70s]  Bulwarking. Bulwark up. It kind of. Oh, it worked. I think maybe. I'm not sure. Big hit. Nice worked.
[7174.39s -> 7179.99s]  Two hundred and twenty two damage. Nice. Sick. Four eighty. Four forty eight.
[7180.87s -> 7186.39s]  Kimono weakness has become apparent in battle. Oh, I see. I see. I see. You can steal. Four
[7186.39s -> 7191.51s]  hundred damage. Karakuri threat from. Those blue areas are their weak points and you can
[7191.51s -> 7198.68s]  steal threat from them. Oh, grab onto with R, B and A. Then you can extract thread.
[7199.48s -> 7208.31s]  Oh, that was pretty cool. He's got like horns now. These things like he's got like antlers.
[7210.86s -> 7218.98s]  Like I'm on top of the thing now. That's weird. So wait, wait, wait, wait. So I can get on and
[7218.98s -> 7227.03s]  then I can extract. Wait, wait. If you do that, you might be. I think you're distracting. Oh,
[7227.03s -> 7232.15s]  you get like a massive abundance of materials. You exceed your limit so you can build like
[7232.15s -> 7242.33s]  massive towers. Speaking of that. Oh, should I have no more. I got no more juice.
[7243.85s -> 7253.05s]  Healing juice right over there. There's the flower right there. 164. Not bad. How did I
[7253.05s -> 7267.06s]  do the spin attack before? I forget. I kind of remember how I did that. These are two. Yep.
[7270.18s -> 7280.14s]  Oh, my God. I am dead. I can help you. Maybe I thought I was out of the range.
[7283.78s -> 7288.66s]  Oh, my. Dude, what did you just do? I just did the bulwark. I'm going to be able to rescue you,
[7288.66s -> 7299.67s]  I think. He just bounced around. One. Wow. MVP. I was a VIP. But you know what? That works, too.
[7301.30s -> 7328.57s]  Oh, my God. I can't see shit. No. All right. It's almost dead. OK. I wasted a bulwark,
[7328.57s -> 7338.71s]  but that's fine. Isn't it so crazy that oil like gives us energy? This weird goop gives us energy.
[7338.71s -> 7342.07s]  Why is this dude in my chat? I don't know. I'm sorry. I apologize.
[7344.70s -> 7349.18s]  Is this what was happening yesterday for you as well? Yeah, I think everybody got on this oil
[7349.18s -> 7355.90s]  thing and I was like, OK, feel free to permanently ban that guy. No, it's OK. I understand. He just
[7355.90s -> 7362.49s]  likes the wonders of oil, I guess. Like it it propels vehicles and like you can cook with it
[7362.49s -> 7369.85s]  and use it like on like skin like use it. I get it. Like, I understand. I'm kind of like team oil now.
[7372.49s -> 7377.45s]  Yes, Jerm. Oh, no, I was making so I was going hmm. Every time I touched one of these things,
[7380.06s -> 7383.98s]  it really used these ziplines, but we're just like, let's run instead.
[7385.88s -> 7392.20s]  In that game against the storm, I choose oil as my first boon chat. So that's weird. Ready?
[7393.30s -> 7406.54s]  Yeah. Fast travel time. Let's go for it. Check it out. Bang. Nice. Please don't tell me you cook
[7406.54s -> 7414.98s]  food with crude oil. Yeah, we so fucked up like you run out of oil. It's like,
[7416.01s -> 7424.86s]  all right, I'll just grab it for my car, I guess. Oh, that hurt. I got to get on one of those crates.
[7425.50s -> 7454.38s]  Oh, work. Do your biggest combo. Biggest combo. Unleash it now. Oh, no, that was an awful noise.
[7454.38s -> 7458.22s]  But yeah, I'm dead. Awful noise. I didn't hear anything. I think you peaked so much that I
[7458.22s -> 7471.85s]  didn't hear you. I have an idea. Oh, my God. Stop. I don't have enough valiant effort.
[7472.81s -> 7481.13s]  Run, run, run. I'm dead. I'm dead. Fuck. No, I'm sorry. I tried to dodge. I didn't know where he was
[7481.13s -> 7488.07s]  going to land. Okay. Oh, the hunt ended in failure. Shit. Oh, because each of us were like,
[7488.07s -> 7494.07s]  we each have one life out of three. And I keep forgetting that there's no iFrames. I'm like,
[7494.07s -> 7497.11s]  oh, just wait for the iFrames. Sorry. Hey, hey, hey, this is a tough one. It's tough.
[7497.51s -> 7502.07s]  You know, Jeremy, we forgot to eat. I don't know why I keep calling you by your full name,
[7502.07s -> 7507.96s]  but we forgot to eat food. It's weird because my name is Dave. I don't know why you keep saying
[7507.96s -> 7513.43s]  that. Yeah, I could call you like Jer or something like Jerry. They call you Jerry. You could call
[7513.43s -> 7521.91s]  me David, which is my name. David. I don't have to keep calling me. All this time. I didn't know
[7521.91s -> 7526.55s]  that. I'm going to talk to you. I'll talk to you after the stream. Okay. You know, it's funny
[7526.55s -> 7533.90s]  because for a long time, people were like, hello, Vinny. Is your real name Vinny? I'm like, yeah,
[7533.90s -> 7543.08s]  no, that's it. I took some defense food. All right. That went a lot better, even though I
[7543.08s -> 7551.51s]  kind of blew it at the end, but it's okay. Well, what about armor? We might have, let's take a look.
[7551.51s -> 7555.19s]  We could look at all this stuff we can make. I already, I already built a bunch of armor.
[7555.19s -> 7564.15s]  Oh, I didn't. Yeah. So I was like able to tank like a couple more hits to the face.
[7564.15s -> 7571.53s]  This is okay. I can make one of these. Is Vinny short for Dave? Yes, it is. Actually, it's a lot
[7571.53s -> 7579.72s]  of fire damage. I'm losing from these. These are the days I know. I know these are the daves. I know
[7579.72s -> 7597.93s]  it hurt. I'm just going to make the just the regular gear better than what I had on. I don't
[7597.93s -> 7604.49s]  think I want to be able to recover health for you. Chat. Do I have to bring these balls with me or
[7604.49s -> 7617.06s]  do they just like do this automatically? I pray for you. We're at 97% face cam turning on. You
[7617.06s -> 7622.07s]  know, close. No, they've been good. Give me one second. They've been good. I'll turn it on.
[7622.07s -> 7633.35s]  One sec. I'm actually going to open your stream to see if you do it. Like, I feel like it's a bit
[7633.35s -> 7639.40s]  incoming, but I don't know. What's up? Nothing. No, it's like, I'm not like joking or anything.
[7639.40s -> 7651.00s]  I'm just turning it on for a minute. So here you go. I'm look, I'm normal. Oh, yeah, there is
[7651.00s -> 7659.40s]  normal, normal Jeremy. I'm just normal. Everyone was like, Hey, what's wrong with you? Man, I wish
[7659.40s -> 7671.26s]  I had. I wish I had that kind of balls. Oh, wait, I do in game. The once every eight weeks
[7671.26s -> 7679.10s]  face cam. There was a point where people saw my face once a year. Like that was like pretty much
[7679.10s -> 7688.38s]  like for just some weird special occasion thing. I like that. It was fine. All right. I've eaten.
[7688.38s -> 7698.18s]  I'm ready. Let me do one more thing real quick, because I want to get this down. Well,
[7698.50s -> 7712.60s]  ah, hmm. Okay. That's jumping splash. I want to get it down. For a while. I thought V-dub was an
[7712.60s -> 7717.32s]  actual different person chat member. That is a different person. V-dub is a different human
[7717.32s -> 7745.10s]  being entirely thousand damage. But why was it doing that? What the hell? Okay. I think I get it.
[7745.10s -> 7760.92s]  I get it. I get it. I'm going to try the bow for a minute. I want to see what that's like.
[7760.92s -> 7772.10s]  Good idea. How about the timing? You got to go like swing and swing now, then swing.
[7773.54s -> 7783.32s]  Line it up. I feel like I'm going to use this combo a lot. Arrow switch.
[7791.32s -> 7797.94s]  This is pretty cool. Shoot. I'll tell you where the higher landed.
[7801.35s -> 7806.50s]  Is it one single shot? Or do you do more than one? You can do a couple of different things.
[7806.50s -> 7816.70s]  But I think, huh, is there like a switch? I see. So when you charge, you can like
[7818.47s -> 7822.87s]  shoot the area you just shot and it does more damage and they explode the other arrows.
[7825.14s -> 7828.34s]  Like, yeah, the arrows get stuck in there and then you can make them explode.
[7830.60s -> 7840.71s]  It's weird. It's that seems like an omega shot. Oh my gosh. Climb crate and then
[7840.71s -> 7851.91s]  RT mid jump. I feel like jumping off of the crates with the hammer seems like that's the way to do
[7851.91s -> 7859.99s]  it. I'm going to only attack by jumping off and just hitting Y. Heavy attack. It's just too good.
[7859.99s -> 7864.95s]  It's just too good. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you find the weapon that works
[7864.95s -> 7870.84s]  for you, honestly, the sword was also kind of broken. So it's pretty happy about that.
[7871.80s -> 7875.64s]  All right. But I think this bow is pretty amazing. I'm going to try this.
[7875.64s -> 7879.88s]  I'm going to try this. Do you want to try the King Tusk again? I think we had it.
[7881.59s -> 7886.31s]  Yeah, we had it. Let's just eat like a good hearty meal before we attack the King Tusk.
[7886.31s -> 7890.78s]  Yeah, I had some defense food. It was pretty sick.
[7891.58s -> 7894.28s]  Jerma, do you like grilled cheese? Oh, yeah, I love grilled cheese,
[7894.28s -> 7895.88s]  especially when I drop it on the ground and eat it.
[7896.68s -> 7900.63s]  Wait, that's an actual thing that's happened? Somebody said that, right?
[7901.27s -> 7905.88s]  No, I just pulled that out of the air, dude. Like, you didn't have to tell me that embarrassing
[7905.88s -> 7909.56s]  moment. I was literally just asking about grilled cheese, like from my no one said that.
[7912.82s -> 7917.30s]  Sure. Yeah, I swear. What do you mean you ate it off the ground? Like David Hasselhoff?
[7917.30s -> 7925.21s]  No. OK, in my pre stream chat today, I said that I was mess. I was joking around. I said that I
[7925.21s -> 7929.13s]  ate a grilled cheese off the ground. And I thought that's because people talk to you about oil.
[7929.13s -> 7933.59s]  I'm just thinking like, oh, they're going over to your stream and bringing up my shit that I do.
[7933.59s -> 7938.07s]  I shit you not. I was just thinking about grilled cheese today because I watched like a recipe like
[7938.07s -> 7942.79s]  Gordon Ramsay just like actually butchered grilled cheese with some like weird recipe.
[7942.79s -> 7948.71s]  And I was just asking. Wait, is it the one where he he puts it like in a weird kettle like like a
[7948.71s -> 7954.98s]  fireplace? Yeah. He's like, OK, we're going to use the saffron. Beautiful. There's like apples on it.
[7955.78s -> 7958.90s]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, we're going to use this expensive cheese that doesn't even
[7959.38s -> 7964.33s]  melt delicious. Best grilled cheese, Vinny. Let's go ahead and discuss.
[7965.37s -> 7968.89s]  OK, I can tell you, but you tell me first, what's yours?
[7968.89s -> 7973.72s]  So how about we both write it down and then say it at the same time out loud?
[7973.72s -> 7980.84s]  OK, I don't need to write mine down, but. Yeah, why would we need to write it down? OK, so you go
[7980.84s -> 7989.43s]  first. OK, it's cheddar in the bread, white bread, just simple. And then you can also put butter on
[7989.43s -> 7995.43s]  the pan and then put cheddar on the other side. And then you can crisp the cheddar in the pan
[7995.43s -> 7999.75s]  on the butter. And like so you have crispy grilled cheese with melty grilled cheese in the middle.
[7999.75s -> 8003.26s]  It's amazing. Now, that sounds amazing.
[8005.26s -> 8010.38s]  I'm going to tell you something. Have you ever have you ever used mayo instead of butter?
[8012.14s -> 8022.90s]  No, like to cook on the pan or just in there. Mayo on the outside instead of on, you know,
[8023.46s -> 8026.98s]  do you like butter the like the sides, right? Like you said, you put butter on one side or
[8026.98s -> 8029.54s]  do you put butter in the pan or do you butter the bread and then put it on?
[8029.54s -> 8033.78s]  I butter the pan and then I put the grilled cheese in there
[8033.78s -> 8036.26s]  because it helps the cheese not stick to the pan.
[8037.67s -> 8042.95s]  Well, I'm into the cheddar. I would say I would add a little bit of Gruyere if I were you.
[8042.95s -> 8047.38s]  Yeah, that's what Gordon Ramsay was doing. Yeah, I don't know about that, buddy.
[8048.74s -> 8051.86s]  If I can't say the cheese name easily, then I'm not sure I'm going to edit.
[8051.86s -> 8054.50s]  I've never even eaten Gruyere. I don't even know what it looks like.
[8054.50s -> 8057.94s]  OK, good. All right. Ready to go fight this big warthog?
[8058.66s -> 8063.64s]  Yeah, I don't know where it is, though. Cheddar is good. I like Swiss, too.
[8063.64s -> 8068.33s]  I just like love Swiss. Monster is my favorite cheese.
[8068.33s -> 8071.37s]  Probably I've talked about this on stream. I love monster cheese and people.
[8071.37s -> 8074.41s]  What do you mean? Monster cheese? Are you milking monsters to get it?
[8074.41s -> 8079.62s]  I'm like, no, no, the male thing is for real. All right.
[8079.62s -> 8081.78s]  It makes it really nice and great. Wait, let me hold on. Can I let me pet?
[8082.74s -> 8089.53s]  You scared it, I think. Oh, here. Try that one. Try that one.
[8094.78s -> 8097.10s]  Mayo outside of bread is life changing. Vinesauce.
[8097.10s -> 8100.86s]  OK, you have supporters for this mayo stuff in chat.
[8100.86s -> 8103.18s]  So I'll take you up on that. I'll give it a shot.
[8103.82s -> 8109.43s]  It's another rat. Oh, another rat.
[8110.79s -> 8116.86s]  Yeah, I think we're going to have to like I do. OK.
[8117.82s -> 8121.82s]  I do really appreciate the fact that we're just in the game and we don't have to leave.
[8121.82s -> 8123.18s]  Like, you don't have to like call me back in.
[8123.18s -> 8125.58s]  I don't feel like a summoning thing down, like we're just in the game playing.
[8126.54s -> 8129.02s]  Yeah. There's been no other screen.
[8129.02s -> 8132.22s]  It's just get in the game and stay in it. Let's just kill this thing.
[8132.22s -> 8135.82s]  Why not? It's free. It's free.
[8135.82s -> 8137.02s]  You want to? Yeah, it's free.
[8137.02s -> 8164.70s]  OK, that would be awesome if I hit it. I mean, it's good practice for the bow, at least.
[8165.58s -> 8167.42s]  Yeah, maybe get the moveset down too.
[8169.54s -> 8173.30s]  Oh, oh, yeah. It explodes the whole thing. The whole rat just exploded.
[8173.30s -> 8181.13s]  It was amazing. I want to hit this so bad.
[8182.01s -> 8196.09s]  Damn it. You can get that right in the head.
[8196.81s -> 8210.02s]  Oh, my God. OK, yeah. So, Chad, here's what you do.
[8210.02s -> 8213.99s]  You have to like shoot the rat with these explosive bolts.
[8213.99s -> 8220.60s]  They don't do a whole lot of damage, but then you can then you can make them all explode.
[8220.60s -> 8226.79s]  It's really cool here. So like that, like that.
[8226.79s -> 8228.23s]  It's fucking. That was a good stagger too.
[8230.90s -> 8233.54s]  Already got it running. Already running.
[8233.54s -> 8235.46s]  Already running. Running. Yeah, it's running.
[8236.84s -> 8238.44s]  Chasing. Running.
[8239.08s -> 8242.28s]  The game's like build a tower to chase.
[8242.92s -> 8244.60s]  Like you said before, we're just running after them.
[8246.20s -> 8248.92s]  Vinny, what is the Lunchables tier list we were promised?
[8250.15s -> 8253.11s]  I never talked about. I've never promised the Lunchables tier list.
[8253.11s -> 8253.99s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[8256.49s -> 8259.53s]  Chad, have you had a Lunchable in your like if if you're an adult,
[8259.53s -> 8260.97s]  have you had a Lunchable recently?
[8262.09s -> 8264.89s]  Like the ham tastes like water flavored ham.
[8264.89s -> 8268.49s]  Like I don't it's so like like weirdly watered down ham.
[8269.37s -> 8271.77s]  You don't like it? No.
[8274.09s -> 8276.49s]  Wait, do you like Lunchables? Did I just insult you?
[8277.21s -> 8279.21s]  No, not that great.
[8279.85s -> 8282.81s]  OK, because when we were kids, it was amazing.
[8282.81s -> 8285.69s]  But like I had one as an adult because I was like, let me be wacky.
[8285.69s -> 8287.05s]  I'm like a wacky, quirky adult.
[8288.89s -> 8290.41s]  I'm like wacky. Like, you don't know.
[8291.13s -> 8293.77s]  So I'm going to try. I'm going to get like a Lunchable as an adult
[8293.77s -> 8296.09s]  and I'm going to try it. And it was like really disappointing.
[8297.30s -> 8298.58s]  Like the magic was just gone.
[8299.72s -> 8301.32s]  Um, the notch was good.
[8301.32s -> 8305.72s]  I ate, I ate a whole stack in one bite.
[8305.72s -> 8309.08s]  This was, um, what am I going to say, like three, four years ago?
[8309.64s -> 8311.88s]  Would not recommend for like a charity or something.
[8311.88s -> 8312.60s]  No, I just did it.
[8313.58s -> 8318.87s]  Oh, um, there is the thing about Lunchables, though, is
[8320.07s -> 8321.83s]  they're actually not that bad.
[8322.89s -> 8324.33s]  Look, it's it's very easy.
[8324.33s -> 8328.41s]  It's just look, it's just all the food groups are in there besides vegetables and fruits.
[8329.05s -> 8330.09s]  Um, right.
[8330.09s -> 8334.17s]  So meaning incredibly important, you know, um, very important, very important.
[8334.17s -> 8335.53s]  It's just not in there.
[8335.53s -> 8339.13s]  Uh, but it's, hey, if you need a snack, it's a good snack.
[8339.13s -> 8339.85s]  It's a good snack.
[8340.81s -> 8343.45s]  As a kid, though, I was like, if I eat a Lunchable, I'm good.
[8343.45s -> 8344.97s]  I'm getting all of my balanced diet.
[8344.97s -> 8345.37s]  It's fine.
[8346.17s -> 8350.98s]  But like what I do these days, if I'm craving that kind of thing,
[8350.98s -> 8353.46s]  I just get like the Hormel pepperoni and cracker meal.
[8354.26s -> 8355.38s]  Like that, that shit's good.
[8356.34s -> 8357.74s]  Yeah.
[8357.74s -> 8359.90s]  They make like kind of adult versions, don't they?
[8359.90s -> 8360.14s]  Yeah.
[8360.14s -> 8360.30s]  Yeah.
[8360.30s -> 8363.26s]  They have like adult versions and like you get like salami and like,
[8363.26s -> 8364.94s]  like you get like fancy cheese.
[8364.94s -> 8366.30s]  It's like, I like that stuff.
[8367.26s -> 8368.30s]  That was a good hit.
[8369.50s -> 8369.98s]  My mod.
[8369.98s -> 8372.46s]  Jeff just said rich people food, bro.
[8372.46s -> 8373.98s]  Bro, salami and cheese.
[8375.10s -> 8375.98s]  Yeah, I disagree.
[8377.26s -> 8383.69s]  Vinny, what's your favorite deli meat?
[8385.56s -> 8387.32s]  Oh, can I answer that for him?
[8387.96s -> 8388.20s]  Yeah.
[8388.20s -> 8388.84s]  Answer that.
[8388.84s -> 8389.56s]  Black horse ham.
[8390.94s -> 8391.74s]  It's good.
[8391.74s -> 8392.54s]  I do like that.
[8393.10s -> 8394.06s]  It's not my favorite.
[8394.86s -> 8396.26s]  Wait, what's yours?
[8398.33s -> 8398.89s]  Black horse ham.
[8398.89s -> 8399.69s]  Black horse ham.
[8399.69s -> 8400.25s]  Oh, all right.
[8400.25s -> 8401.69s]  I thought you answered for me.
[8401.69s -> 8403.13s]  Oh, like, yeah, I'm just speaking for you.
[8403.13s -> 8404.33s]  It's yours is black horse ham.
[8405.86s -> 8406.42s]  It is now.
[8407.30s -> 8408.10s]  I like deli chicken.
[8409.48s -> 8410.60s]  Yeah, I like that too.
[8410.60s -> 8412.12s]  Deli chicken slice chicken.
[8412.12s -> 8412.84s]  Yeah, it's good stuff.
[8413.40s -> 8414.36s]  I haven't had that in a while.
[8416.09s -> 8419.35s]  I like, I'm going to tell you, you know what?
[8419.35s -> 8422.79s]  Since we're talking about food, I want to tell you about a sandwich that I really like
[8422.79s -> 8426.31s]  that I found on the internet that I now get my deli guy to make for me.
[8426.31s -> 8427.83s]  I'm a huge sandwich fan, so.
[8428.79s -> 8429.11s]  All right.
[8429.11s -> 8429.75s]  Cool.
[8429.75s -> 8431.27s]  Because I love a good sandwich.
[8431.27s -> 8434.79s]  I like really good like store roast beef.
[8434.79s -> 8436.07s]  That's like my favorite.
[8436.07s -> 8440.63s]  There's like a little salt on it and it's like, like store-made, like good shit.
[8440.63s -> 8441.99s]  That's like perfect.
[8442.63s -> 8451.03s]  I'm not a huge roast beef fan, but if it's good, toasted bread, slice of fucking provolone
[8451.03s -> 8452.07s]  on it, let's get weird, right?
[8452.07s -> 8452.71s]  Love that.
[8452.71s -> 8453.35s]  Yeah, love that.
[8453.99s -> 8459.19s]  If you're ever in New York, I would take you for like the best pastrami sandwich you'd
[8459.19s -> 8459.91s]  ever have in your life.
[8459.91s -> 8461.19s]  Oh, don't say that.
[8461.19s -> 8465.27s]  I'll literally get on a plane tomorrow because I got some good things.
[8465.99s -> 8468.87s]  Yeah, I got some good places like pastrami, corned beef.
[8469.43s -> 8470.47s]  It's just unbelievable.
[8472.42s -> 8475.94s]  I'll tell you about the sandwich and maybe you'll be interested.
[8475.94s -> 8476.34s]  I don't know.
[8476.34s -> 8477.94s]  But all right.
[8477.94s -> 8484.34s]  Chicken cutlet with pepperoni on top and fresh mozzarella.
[8485.22s -> 8491.96s]  And what you do is you put that in the toaster oven for a little bit and you let the pepperoni
[8491.96s -> 8495.56s]  sweat onto the chicken, right?
[8495.56s -> 8501.80s]  You let it sweat onto the chicken and the mozzarella melts a little bit and then mustard
[8501.80s -> 8502.84s]  on both sides of the roll.
[8503.40s -> 8505.00s]  It is life-changing.
[8505.00s -> 8505.72s]  It's so good.
[8506.76s -> 8511.48s]  That sounds so there's some shit YouTube chef who said he made that drunk in college
[8512.36s -> 8516.04s]  and he said it was like the best sandwich you ever had.
[8516.04s -> 8516.76s]  So I tried it.
[8518.28s -> 8519.85s]  It's that good.
[8520.57s -> 8523.53s]  There it is.
[8524.09s -> 8525.70s]  That sounds incredible.
[8526.65s -> 8527.53s]  Good job, Jerma.
[8527.53s -> 8532.33s]  The only problem is I'm not a huge pepperoni and salami fan.
[8533.61s -> 8537.45s]  Okay, so you're not into like the salted like dry meat.
[8537.45s -> 8538.25s]  I like it.
[8538.25s -> 8540.41s]  I just I don't really love it.
[8542.70s -> 8543.10s]  That's fair.
[8543.10s -> 8543.66s]  You know what it does?
[8543.66s -> 8545.90s]  It just gives the chicken a little extra push.
[8545.90s -> 8549.74s]  Like it doesn't really you don't get as you can put as much or as little pepperoni,
[8549.74s -> 8550.86s]  but I loved it.
[8550.94s -> 8552.38s]  Are you more mustard or more mayo?
[8552.38s -> 8553.98s]  Because I think you're more of a mayo guy.
[8553.98s -> 8554.70s]  I would imagine.
[8554.70s -> 8556.70s]  I like them both, but I'm more of a mayo guy.
[8557.50s -> 8557.82s]  Okay.
[8557.82s -> 8558.78s]  Yeah, I am too.
[8559.66s -> 8560.57s]  You know what?
[8560.57s -> 8562.17s]  You know what other kind of guy I am?
[8562.17s -> 8565.78s]  Kind of guy that is enjoying this experience.
[8566.42s -> 8568.42s]  Thank you to EA for sponsoring this stream again.
[8569.78s -> 8573.70s]  If you want to check it out, it's on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S.
[8574.26s -> 8575.83s]  Kind of a monster hunting game.
[8576.47s -> 8578.55s]  You can, you know, get materials.
[8578.55s -> 8579.03s]  Quite shit.
[8579.67s -> 8580.15s]  Pretty fun.
[8580.95s -> 8583.16s]  Thank you, EA again.
[8583.80s -> 8588.41s]  I'd like to point out that I don't have to say any of those things,
[8588.41s -> 8589.61s]  but I'm enjoying the game.
[8590.89s -> 8591.69s]  I'm enjoying it.
[8594.38s -> 8596.70s]  I got to find a time to come out to the East Coast.
[8597.34s -> 8598.79s]  Just do like an East Coast trip.
[8599.91s -> 8600.47s]  Yeah, you should.
[8601.19s -> 8603.35s]  Ross was out here not too long ago.
[8603.35s -> 8607.16s]  And I took him for a pizza.
[8607.16s -> 8607.96s]  I took him.
[8607.96s -> 8609.64s]  We had some cool, cool stuff.
[8609.64s -> 8610.52s]  Good meals and stuff.
[8610.52s -> 8610.92s]  It's fun.
[8612.22s -> 8613.50s]  Kraken was here a couple.
[8614.22s -> 8616.54s]  Kraken was here around the holidays.
[8616.54s -> 8618.54s]  And we got some some noodles and stuff.
[8618.54s -> 8619.42s]  And yeah, it was fun.
[8620.74s -> 8622.90s]  I could go for some New York pizza.
[8622.90s -> 8623.30s]  I'll tell you.
[8623.30s -> 8626.95s]  That's like my favorite style.
[8626.95s -> 8629.35s]  Well, I know the spots.
[8629.99s -> 8632.12s]  Oh, I bet you do.
[8632.12s -> 8633.24s]  What do you got in Vegas?
[8633.24s -> 8635.24s]  I love pizza in Vegas.
[8635.24s -> 8635.74s]  Dogshit.
[8638.57s -> 8641.45s]  There is like no good pizza in Vegas, unfortunately.
[8641.45s -> 8644.17s]  There's some that are okay that I've had.
[8645.13s -> 8647.05s]  Vegas is not a pizza city at all.
[8647.05s -> 8647.85s]  This one.
[8647.85s -> 8652.78s]  This is a monster we've never seen, I don't think.
[8652.78s -> 8653.28s]  So what?
[8654.71s -> 8655.35s]  We'll go to it.
[8655.35s -> 8656.55s]  We'll check it out.
[8656.55s -> 8661.99s]  So what do you what in Vegas is good that like you go for on a regular occurrence?
[8662.98s -> 8666.50s]  Pretty much any of the sit down restaurants in Vegas are some of the best in the country.
[8667.37s -> 8669.53s]  You're talking about like like steakhouse type stuff?
[8669.53s -> 8672.41s]  Steak houses, a lot of sushi places that are like 10 out of 10.
[8673.05s -> 8673.61s]  Oh, shit.
[8673.61s -> 8673.93s]  Okay.
[8674.57s -> 8677.37s]  There's a lot of like amazing Korean barbecue out here.
[8678.50s -> 8681.27s]  Dude, I love Korean barbecue.
[8681.27s -> 8681.91s]  Yeah.
[8681.91s -> 8685.98s]  You got McDonald's?
[8686.97s -> 8687.77s]  We got McDonald's.
[8687.77s -> 8689.37s]  We got McDonald's out here.
[8689.37s -> 8690.65s]  Oh, nice, dude.
[8690.65s -> 8691.13s]  All right.
[8691.13s -> 8692.65s]  Is that the same monster?
[8692.65s -> 8693.53s]  I think it is.
[8693.53s -> 8695.27s]  Why is it a question mark?
[8695.27s -> 8696.55s]  Well, there's a Sap Scourge.
[8696.55s -> 8698.55s]  This might be one we've never seen before.
[8698.55s -> 8699.35s]  It looks weird.
[8700.31s -> 8701.19s]  Oh, wait, wait, it does.
[8701.19s -> 8702.87s]  No, no, that looks like the one.
[8702.87s -> 8703.67s]  I think so, yeah.
[8703.67s -> 8703.99s]  Yeah.
[8703.99s -> 8704.49s]  Let's get it.
[8705.99s -> 8706.55s]  Okay, hang on.
[8706.55s -> 8708.87s]  Let me see if I can build a wacky thing here.
[8709.75s -> 8715.77s]  He's just like in the village, just hanging out in here.
[8721.59s -> 8722.71s]  He's just chilling.
[8722.71s -> 8730.63s]  He's literally just hanging out in here.
[8730.63s -> 8732.31s]  Ask him what his McDonald's order is.
[8732.31s -> 8733.43s]  You won't be disappointed.
[8734.23s -> 8735.59s]  It's changed over the years, though.
[8737.58s -> 8737.98s]  Why?
[8737.98s -> 8739.58s]  Was that like a weird order or?
[8739.58s -> 8742.94s]  I used to get like two McChickens, two McDoubles,
[8743.50s -> 8745.10s]  a large drink, a large fry.
[8745.10s -> 8746.06s]  It was fucking bad.
[8746.06s -> 8746.94s]  It was actually bad.
[8747.58s -> 8748.94s]  How do you eat that much?
[8748.94s -> 8749.66s]  I don't know.
[8749.66s -> 8750.22s]  I just did.
[8751.26s -> 8751.50s]  Okay.
[8751.50s -> 8751.90s]  It was bad.
[8754.65s -> 8755.53s]  Are you up here?
[8755.53s -> 8756.17s]  Are they where?
[8756.17s -> 8756.57s]  I am.
[8756.57s -> 8757.05s]  I'm ready.
[8757.85s -> 8758.26s]  All right.
[8758.26s -> 8759.62s]  You ready to take this down?
[8760.42s -> 8761.06s]  Yeah.
[8761.06s -> 8762.10s]  Let's do it.
[8762.10s -> 8762.74s]  We got resources.
[8762.74s -> 8763.78s]  Yep, I got 12.
[8763.78s -> 8764.26s]  You got enough?
[8765.06s -> 8765.86s]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[8765.86s -> 8766.36s]  Let's do it.
[8767.54s -> 8773.61s]  Okay.
[8773.61s -> 8774.97s]  As soon as we find that weak point,
[8774.97s -> 8777.29s]  I'll be able to like shoot it directly.
[8789.98s -> 8793.27s]  All right.
[8793.27s -> 8793.91s]  That was a big hit.
[8794.79s -> 8795.99s]  May have exposed some flesh.
[8810.55s -> 8811.05s]  Two.
[8812.39s -> 8813.67s]  He's exposed over on this side.
[8814.31s -> 8814.55s]  Okay.
[8815.11s -> 8817.03s]  Now, Jerma, if you grab that stuff,
[8817.03s -> 8818.71s]  you can get a ton of materials.
[8818.71s -> 8819.27s]  Really?
[8819.27s -> 8819.51s]  All right.
[8819.51s -> 8819.91s]  How do we?
[8819.91s -> 8820.55s]  I got to try to get.
[8821.75s -> 8824.23s]  The run button and then just like jump onto it.
[8824.23s -> 8825.99s]  And then you continue grabbing
[8825.99s -> 8827.51s]  and then you can get all the materials.
[8827.51s -> 8828.07s]  It's amazing.
[8828.07s -> 8828.47s]  I know.
[8828.47s -> 8829.11s]  Face cam is on.
[8829.11s -> 8829.83s]  People are going to love that one.
[8829.83s -> 8830.15s]  Clip it.
[8830.15s -> 8830.55s]  I don't care.
[8832.23s -> 8832.63s]  All right.
[8832.63s -> 8833.75s]  I'm seeing materials.
[8833.75s -> 8833.99s]  Shit.
[8835.11s -> 8835.53s]  Oh, wait.
[8835.53s -> 8837.21s]  Has he got the glowing blue spot yet or no?
[8837.69s -> 8838.49s]  I got fucking magical.
[8838.49s -> 8838.81s]  Oh, he does.
[8838.81s -> 8839.53s]  He doesn't even know.
[8840.41s -> 8840.73s]  Okay.
[8842.17s -> 8843.45s]  See if I can grab some of this too.
[8850.90s -> 8853.06s]  Did the pig just say appreciate you?
[8854.34s -> 8855.14s]  What the fuck?
[8855.70s -> 8856.58s]  No, I don't think it did.
[8858.02s -> 8859.14s]  No, it did.
[8859.14s -> 8861.06s]  I swear to God, it did.
[8862.02s -> 8865.78s]  There's no way a pig spoke English.
[8865.78s -> 8866.34s]  It did.
[8866.34s -> 8866.98s]  I just did.
[8866.98s -> 8870.98s]  It had to have smoked English.
[8875.62s -> 8876.26s]  215.
[8876.26s -> 8877.14s]  Oh, nice hit.
[8877.14s -> 8877.62s]  Nice hit.
[8878.50s -> 8885.62s]  Big hit.
[8886.34s -> 8886.58s]  No.
[8887.46s -> 8892.14s]  Oh, come on.
[8892.14s -> 8893.26s]  I landed that.
[8896.90s -> 8901.24s]  Damn it.
[8905.45s -> 8908.50s]  These wash died.
[8909.22s -> 8924.17s]  Winging around.
[8925.37s -> 8926.09s]  I was so loud.
[8926.09s -> 8926.65s]  I'm sorry, dude.
[8927.61s -> 8928.65s]  I don't hear it.
[8928.65s -> 8929.13s]  It's being.
[8929.77s -> 8930.01s]  Yeah.
[8930.01s -> 8932.73s]  Discord is like just limiting the fuck out of that.
[8932.73s -> 8933.69s]  So it's not loud at all.
[8936.74s -> 8938.98s]  Slamming the compressor, I believe we call it in the biz.
[8942.36s -> 8943.00s]  We got it running.
[8943.88s -> 8945.51s]  Not yet.
[8946.23s -> 8946.71s]  Now it is.
[8946.71s -> 8947.83s]  There it goes.
[8947.83s -> 8949.24s]  All right.
[8949.24s -> 8949.80s]  Let's catch up.
[8953.98s -> 8954.78s]  It didn't go very far.
[8956.02s -> 8956.50s]  Not really.
[8963.56s -> 8964.28s]  I appreciate it.
[8965.24s -> 8966.46s]  Yeah.
[8966.46s -> 8967.66s]  It's like you hit him.
[8967.66s -> 8968.30s]  He's like, thank you.
[8968.30s -> 8969.34s]  I appreciate it.
[8969.42s -> 8971.90s]  His mouth moved perfectly to appreciate it.
[8971.90s -> 8973.58s]  It was actually very humorous.
[8978.70s -> 8981.90s]  People are saying that you got a lot of good Mexican food in small places.
[8981.90s -> 8982.46s]  Oh, yeah.
[8982.46s -> 8983.90s]  In Korean traditional barbecue.
[8984.54s -> 8989.26s]  It seems like you have everything except like good bagels and good pizza.
[8989.26s -> 8989.74s]  I'll tell you.
[8990.62s -> 8992.78s]  Sub shops and pizza places.
[8994.46s -> 8994.70s]  Yeah.
[8994.70s -> 8995.98s]  Some there are some good breakfast places,
[8995.98s -> 9000.94s]  but that counter serve deli counter serve subs pizza.
[9000.94s -> 9002.38s]  Yeah, I live for that.
[9002.46s -> 9003.42s]  That's my favorite food.
[9003.42s -> 9004.14s]  And it's not here.
[9004.14s -> 9004.54s]  Yeah.
[9004.54s -> 9005.98s]  Well, you're an East Coast guy.
[9005.98s -> 9007.74s]  I guess you kind of grew up with that like I did.
[9007.74s -> 9010.20s]  So yeah, I love that shit.
[9010.76s -> 9011.56s]  It's very angry.
[9011.56s -> 9012.44s]  Be careful.
[9012.44s -> 9012.76s]  Wait.
[9015.82s -> 9016.70s]  That was awesome.
[9029.34s -> 9029.66s]  Get it.
[9030.22s -> 9031.42s]  Oh, that was a good one.
[9032.06s -> 9047.85s]  It didn't look like I did any damage.
[9050.92s -> 9053.16s]  So we're phase three is when it is horns light up, right?
[9053.88s -> 9054.68s]  I think so.
[9071.78s -> 9072.02s]  Nice.
[9072.02s -> 9072.26s]  Okay.
[9077.18s -> 9077.82s]  Two.
[9077.82s -> 9078.30s]  Wait, what?
[9079.02s -> 9080.23s]  What do you mean to?
[9085.85s -> 9086.97s]  Oh, shit.
[9086.97s -> 9088.33s]  I don't even know if that hurt.
[9088.33s -> 9089.13s]  That was full, though.
[9089.77s -> 9090.57s]  215.
[9090.57s -> 9090.97s]  Okay.
[9090.97s -> 9091.85s]  Now I'm getting it.
[9091.85s -> 9093.13s]  Horns coming up.
[9093.13s -> 9096.02s]  This game has critical range.
[9096.02s -> 9098.82s]  Oh, you have to be closer to do better damage with the bow.
[9098.82s -> 9099.14s]  I see.
[9100.02s -> 9124.39s]  Oh, this dude just slammed through my bulwark or work.
[9127.74s -> 9128.94s]  Let's get fucking weird.
[9128.94s -> 9129.50s]  Watch this.
[9129.50s -> 9129.98s]  Oh, never mind.
[9129.98s -> 9131.02s]  I don't have enough resources.
[9144.50s -> 9144.74s]  Shit.
[9146.55s -> 9147.35s]  That was good.
[9147.99s -> 9148.71s]  That was good.
[9149.67s -> 9151.82s]  Seems pretty unhappy.
[9158.07s -> 9159.43s]  Oh, my God.
[9159.43s -> 9160.15s]  It's weak point.
[9168.89s -> 9169.93s]  Get the blue weak spot.
[9169.93s -> 9171.05s]  I do, but it doesn't.
[9171.05s -> 9173.53s]  If your crosshair is white, it won't do damage.
[9173.53s -> 9174.65s]  Oh, that makes sense.
[9175.61s -> 9178.66s]  I don't have any.
[9178.66s -> 9183.77s]  Oh, what?
[9183.77s -> 9185.37s]  What don't you have for a bulwark?
[9185.37s -> 9186.25s]  I was trying to do a bulwark.
[9186.81s -> 9187.05s]  Okay.
[9187.05s -> 9188.33s]  I got one up over here.
[9189.29s -> 9192.81s]  Get it.
[9193.37s -> 9193.85s]  Nice.
[9193.85s -> 9194.09s]  All right.
[9194.09s -> 9194.89s]  That was like 500.
[9202.46s -> 9203.50s]  I understand now, chat.
[9203.50s -> 9206.38s]  I was just too far away because this bow is amazing.
[9207.10s -> 9209.98s]  And I was wondering, like, why is this weapon so broken?
[9209.98s -> 9211.58s]  It's because you have to be kind of close.
[9214.73s -> 9216.73s]  That's why we place this shit everywhere like this.
[9217.37s -> 9218.41s]  Just to be able to hop around.
[9219.61s -> 9221.29s]  So you make a permanent route.
[9222.25s -> 9223.05s]  I get it.
[9223.05s -> 9223.85s]  I get it.
[9223.85s -> 9226.89s]  And then the world just changes as you continue adding stuff.
[9226.89s -> 9227.69s]  So that way it's like...
[9228.49s -> 9230.25s]  I mean, when people were saying death stranding,
[9230.25s -> 9231.61s]  I was like, wait, what are you talking about?
[9231.61s -> 9232.73s]  Now I kind of understand.
[9232.73s -> 9233.85s]  We have a situation over here.
[9235.58s -> 9236.70s]  What's that situation?
[9236.70s -> 9237.82s]  You'll see when we turn the corner.
[9238.78s -> 9241.16s]  Oh, that of the situation.
[9242.46s -> 9243.74s]  Yeah, the sap scourge, dude.
[9244.38s -> 9247.59s]  I think it's all right.
[9247.59s -> 9247.99s]  Keep going.
[9247.99s -> 9249.83s]  Yeah, I think we could just keep moving.
[9250.47s -> 9263.35s]  Is it a better spot for it?
[9263.35s -> 9265.59s]  It was an amazing shortcut, Jerma.
[9266.47s -> 9266.87s]  Got one?
[9267.59s -> 9267.99s]  Oh, yeah.
[9269.03s -> 9269.75s]  You got to take that.
[9269.75s -> 9272.07s]  It's literally right exactly where we have to be.
[9272.87s -> 9274.97s]  Why can I not grab this?
[9274.97s -> 9275.61s]  What's wrong with me?
[9276.89s -> 9279.37s]  You hold the run button, press A, jump into it.
[9279.37s -> 9280.33s]  What's going on here?
[9280.33s -> 9282.47s]  That was weird.
[9283.11s -> 9288.89s]  It was covering my health a little bit.
[9289.45s -> 9290.25s]  All right.
[9290.25s -> 9291.05s]  Let's finish it.
[9291.77s -> 9300.14s]  They do make these big trees.
[9300.14s -> 9300.94s]  It's really weird.
[9301.66s -> 9308.46s]  Oh, damn.
[9309.34s -> 9310.62s]  I just got my ass handed to me.
[9311.34s -> 9313.56s]  Try to get back again.
[9314.28s -> 9320.89s]  It's like almost some Star Wars in this music.
[9321.61s -> 9322.65s]  Like the Force theme.
[9322.65s -> 9323.21s]  It's very good.
[9324.09s -> 9326.14s]  It's very, like, intense.
[9326.14s -> 9326.97s]  It is.
[9328.84s -> 9329.08s]  Yes.
[9330.47s -> 9330.87s]  Worth it.
[9331.51s -> 9339.32s]  Got a bulwark?
[9340.81s -> 9341.77s]  Ah, don't even need it.
[9357.18s -> 9359.69s]  I'm running out of heals.
[9360.33s -> 9366.68s]  Too far.
[9367.24s -> 9368.28s]  Oh, no, not too bad.
[9368.28s -> 9369.40s]  Still did some decent damage.
[9373.61s -> 9375.61s]  I got a bulwark up in case we need it.
[9376.49s -> 9379.64s]  I'm going to run behind it.
[9384.78s -> 9385.34s]  Oh, you got it.
[9385.34s -> 9385.66s]  You got it.
[9385.66s -> 9386.62s]  It is now time.
[9386.62s -> 9387.34s]  It is now time.
[9388.22s -> 9392.81s]  Right in the head.
[9392.81s -> 9393.29s]  Right in the head.
[9393.29s -> 9393.77s]  Right in the head.
[9394.65s -> 9396.33s]  Oh, fuck.
[9396.33s -> 9396.57s]  Yeah.
[9398.38s -> 9400.94s]  Oh, that felt so good because we lost to it the first time.
[9400.94s -> 9402.38s]  It's like even more satisfying.
[9404.41s -> 9405.61s]  You can do the final blow.
[9407.69s -> 9408.17s]  Yeah, yeah.
[9409.05s -> 9416.33s]  What happened?
[9416.33s -> 9417.05s]  That was weird.
[9417.05s -> 9418.65s]  Wait, did I just destroy our tower?
[9420.98s -> 9423.38s]  I just like, I guess I don't know.
[9423.38s -> 9424.66s]  I broke a lot of buildings.
[9424.66s -> 9425.78s]  What happened?
[9425.78s -> 9426.34s]  I don't know.
[9426.34s -> 9426.66s]  Okay.
[9431.24s -> 9431.72s]  That was fun.
[9431.72s -> 9432.28s]  All right, great.
[9434.81s -> 9438.23s]  That was fun.
[9438.79s -> 9440.23s]  Lyco tower destroyed, yeah.
[9441.67s -> 9444.55s]  Charge blue-green arrows for level three for volley arrows.
[9445.48s -> 9446.52s]  Can you charge level three?
[9446.52s -> 9447.88s]  I guess you can, if you're saying I can.
[9449.62s -> 9450.74s]  Why did this come out, by the way?
[9450.74s -> 9451.78s]  This come out like today.
[9452.42s -> 9455.46s]  I believe last night or midnight, maybe.
[9456.10s -> 9460.66s]  Okay, because I was wondering, like, how do people even, like, know how to do?
[9461.96s -> 9468.01s]  And now I understand.
[9468.01s -> 9470.73s]  Tattoo that logo on your head.
[9470.73s -> 9481.14s]  Did you see the land retake its original form?
[9482.30s -> 9488.38s]  By hunting the Yamaugachs, you reversed the influence of the Kemono.
[9488.38s -> 9491.34s]  Minato is but a stone's throw from here.
[9492.74s -> 9494.42s]  You saved it from being...
[9494.42s -> 9496.18s]  I don't think he said the Amogus chat.
[9499.21s -> 9502.81s]  So I wonder if that's the first sort of, like, tutorial chapter.
[9504.89s -> 9505.85s]  Because I feel like at the very...
[9505.85s -> 9506.65s]  I think it is, chat was saying.
[9506.65s -> 9509.37s]  Yeah, at the end of that, I feel like I know how to play the game.
[9509.37s -> 9510.89s]  I feel like the guy know how to play now.
[9510.89s -> 9511.45s]  Like, I get it.
[9513.61s -> 9517.29s]  The answer you seek is woven into your soul.
[9517.29s -> 9522.04s]  You need only reach out and grasp it.
[9522.04s -> 9525.72s]  As guidance, I can give you only this.
[9527.14s -> 9530.58s]  Hunt, hunt the Kemono.
[9531.14s -> 9533.85s]  You know, with brave...
[9533.85s -> 9535.21s]  For a second, I was like, what's wrong with the game?
[9535.85s -> 9537.53s]  Oh, no, that was what was wrong with me.
[9538.09s -> 9539.61s]  This is impatience, is all it is.
[9539.61s -> 9540.33s]  Whoop, whoop, whoop.
[9540.33s -> 9544.34s]  Excellent.
[9544.34s -> 9544.84s]  What's this?
[9545.93s -> 9552.38s]  Uh, I don't know.
[9552.38s -> 9553.26s]  Back in action.
[9555.34s -> 9557.82s]  That tower just, like, got destroyed again.
[9557.82s -> 9558.54s]  Wait, what?
[9558.54s -> 9559.82s]  Jerma, what's happening here?
[9560.38s -> 9562.06s]  I'm just so strong.
[9574.20s -> 9575.24s]  Literally, what the fuck?
[9578.97s -> 9579.53s]  I think...
[9580.25s -> 9583.13s]  I think it doesn't want us to lose the tower,
[9583.13s -> 9585.37s]  but the pig is lying on top of it.
[9586.83s -> 9588.35s]  Can we get the pig out of here?
[9588.35s -> 9589.71s]  How do we move the pig?
[9589.71s -> 9591.47s]  He's ruining our structures.
[9598.01s -> 9599.53s]  It doesn't take much to amuse me.
[9599.53s -> 9600.17s]  I swear to God.
[9600.17s -> 9600.97s]  How do we delete it?
[9601.77s -> 9602.41s]  I don't know.
[9606.00s -> 9607.20s]  Here, I think I know how to do it.
[9607.20s -> 9608.32s]  I'll try to delete it.
[9609.12s -> 9610.88s]  It's hog-locked.
[9610.88s -> 9613.76s]  Yeah, I think it's because we got the exact moment
[9613.76s -> 9617.28s]  when I baseball swung him into that structure,
[9617.92s -> 9619.76s]  and I think he's stuck inside of it.
[9620.88s -> 9622.88s]  That just scared the shit out of me.
[9623.68s -> 9626.09s]  And I didn't even, like, it didn't even look like it.
[9626.09s -> 9627.29s]  I didn't go like, holy shit.
[9629.20s -> 9629.84s]  Oh, my God.
[9634.11s -> 9634.99s]  Yeah, all right.
[9634.99s -> 9636.27s]  Well, that just keeps happening.
[9636.27s -> 9637.23s]  Look for dragon pits.
[9637.23s -> 9638.35s]  Let's look for dragon pits.
[9638.35s -> 9638.91s]  Over here, look.
[9639.87s -> 9643.55s]  Yeah, the pig is too big on top of everything.
[9648.00s -> 9650.48s]  Okay, so then we can do this one.
[9653.36s -> 9653.60s]  Good.
[9657.36s -> 9658.96s]  Believe it or not, that was the hog that said that.
[9660.54s -> 9661.98s]  I want to see the clip of that.
[9661.98s -> 9662.78s]  I want to see the clip of that.
[9662.78s -> 9663.34s]  It was funny.
[9674.78s -> 9678.35s]  So I'm just getting the essence of each sentence, you know?
[9680.06s -> 9681.58s]  All right, I want to see this.
[9681.58s -> 9686.00s]  All right, Vinny, if you want to see the pig talk,
[9686.80s -> 9689.20s]  uh, open up my stream in...
[9689.20s -> 9690.64s]  Someone already linked the clip.
[9690.64s -> 9691.60s]  Oh, okay, there you go.
[9692.40s -> 9694.01s]  I gotta...
[9694.01s -> 9695.37s]  It was very humorous.
[9695.37s -> 9701.92s]  I gotta watch it in a second.
[9710.48s -> 9711.68s]  All right, I'm gonna watch it now.
[9711.68s -> 9712.40s]  Yeah, let's watch it.
[9714.75s -> 9715.39s]  Oh, my God.
[9717.42s -> 9718.38s]  Your face, too.
[9721.18s -> 9723.34s]  Did the pig just say, appreciate you?
[9731.31s -> 9732.43s]  It's fucking perfect.
[9732.43s -> 9733.39s]  It's uncanny.
[9733.39s -> 9734.11s]  It's like, perfect.
[9734.27s -> 9734.83s]  It's perfect.
[9735.47s -> 9737.55s]  I gotta show the chat because they really want to see it.
[9740.30s -> 9742.62s]  Look, and you can see, like, Jerma's reaction to it.
[9742.62s -> 9743.90s]  He's just, like, befuddled.
[9747.34s -> 9747.98s]  That was fun.
[9753.44s -> 9753.84s]  This is a...
[9753.84s -> 9754.72s]  Ooh, look at the mountain.
[9757.08s -> 9758.44s]  Okay, hang on, hang on.
[9758.44s -> 9761.42s]  That was really fucking perfect timing.
[9761.42s -> 9764.86s]  Okay, uh, look at the mountain.
[9764.86s -> 9765.82s]  There's a mountain.
[9765.82s -> 9766.62s]  Huge, right behind you.
[9768.84s -> 9769.32s]  Oh, shit.
[9773.44s -> 9776.73s]  Flying vine.
[9776.73s -> 9778.17s]  Ah, it wants us to do this.
[9779.05s -> 9781.84s]  What, like, to the mountain or to this place?
[9787.50s -> 9788.22s]  Oh, right, right.
[9788.86s -> 9792.68s]  Yeah, I almost missed it.
[9793.32s -> 9796.36s]  So now this is...
[9796.36s -> 9798.60s]  I think we're opening up the hub world or something, right?
[9798.60s -> 9799.48s]  That's what it seems like.
[9800.76s -> 9801.16s]  Oh, yeah.
[9803.02s -> 9804.38s]  Yeah, I think this is the big town.
[9806.24s -> 9808.35s]  Appreciate it.
[9808.35s -> 9809.47s]  Appreciate it.
[9809.47s -> 9810.67s]  I gotta watch it one more time.
[9811.39s -> 9812.28s]  Just one...
[9812.28s -> 9813.88s]  I promise one more, and that's it.
[9813.88s -> 9815.08s]  Like, it was...
[9815.08s -> 9816.12s]  It's perfect.
[9816.12s -> 9817.64s]  It's actually, like, kind of perfect.
[9827.20s -> 9829.36s]  Did the pig just say appreciate you?
[9833.63s -> 9835.82s]  It's...
[9835.82s -> 9836.94s]  I love it so much.
[9836.94s -> 9838.78s]  That's, like, my favorite moment of the whole day.
[9838.78s -> 9840.64s]  Well, we made it.
[9840.64s -> 9843.28s]  Someone just said that would be a good sub-graphic for a stream.
[9844.80s -> 9847.28s]  It's just a close-up of the pig, and I appreciate it.
[9847.92s -> 9850.88s]  Yeah, it even sounded like it came from the pig's direction, too.
[9851.52s -> 9851.76s]  Yeah.
[9852.64s -> 9858.59s]  Yeah, this is definitely, like, the hub world.
[9875.61s -> 9877.29s]  There's no bunny dongo here, chat.
[9884.16s -> 9885.76s]  There is bunny dongo junior, though.
[9886.80s -> 9888.96s]  So here's a big kicker here.
[9892.30s -> 9892.86s]  Yes.
[9892.86s -> 9893.50s]  Hold on, this is...
[9895.00s -> 9895.48s]  What are we...
[9895.48s -> 9896.04s]  What is that?
[9897.00s -> 9898.36s]  It's some kind of sack.
[9898.36s -> 9898.84s]  Is that the...
[9899.48s -> 9901.58s]  I think we carved that off of one of the monsters.
[9901.58s -> 9902.30s]  Off of a rat?
[9903.18s -> 9903.42s]  Yeah.
[9904.06s -> 9909.98s]  It's like those popping videos you see on the internet.
[9911.74s -> 9917.23s]  It's a big payout.
[9920.12s -> 9922.04s]  It's the scorn goal of the dong fish.
[9929.72s -> 9936.91s]  You weren't very good at that, apparently.
[9946.24s -> 9954.08s]  Don't talk during the movie.
[9954.40s -> 9961.50s]  Started to feel at home yet?
[9961.50s -> 9962.62s]  Well, good for you, then.
[9966.86s -> 9967.42s]  Or run.
[9967.42s -> 9968.78s]  Yeah, from Final Fantasy X.
[9986.04s -> 9986.92s]  Time to go to sleep.
[9995.00s -> 9995.56s]  Good talk.
[9995.56s -> 9996.76s]  Yeah, good talk with that dude.
[10002.86s -> 10005.02s]  Jeremiah, are you seeing your character or my character?
[10005.02s -> 10006.46s]  I see your character.
[10007.76s -> 10011.02s]  Why do they always wear these jabroni outfits,
[10011.02s -> 10014.80s]  like in these monster hunting games?
[10014.80s -> 10017.68s]  Like, I swear to God, they have the jabroniest outfits I've ever seen.
[10020.92s -> 10022.44s]  New armor can now be forged.
[10025.56s -> 10026.92s]  Let me take a look at this area.
[10027.48s -> 10029.08s]  Your home is a convenient place.
[10029.08s -> 10030.76s]  You go, all right, so here's the kicker.
[10030.76s -> 10031.56s]  This was the kicker.
[10031.56s -> 10032.04s]  This was...
[10032.04s -> 10034.40s]  Here we go.
[10034.40s -> 10037.90s]  We are still in each other's game.
[10037.90s -> 10039.58s]  I can see you were literally running around across the way.
[10039.58s -> 10040.78s]  Oh yeah, I see the chef.
[10040.78s -> 10041.42s]  Yeah, there you go.
[10041.42s -> 10041.98s]  That's a huge...
[10041.98s -> 10044.30s]  Do you have a home or is this my home only?
[10044.30s -> 10045.02s]  Be honest.
[10045.02s -> 10045.90s]  That's a big deal.
[10045.90s -> 10046.54s]  That I don't...
[10046.54s -> 10046.86s]  We don't...
[10046.86s -> 10048.70s]  Like, oh, invite me from like something
[10048.70s -> 10049.90s]  and I join this thing.
[10049.90s -> 10050.94s]  Join off me.
[10050.94s -> 10051.82s]  We're just here.
[10051.82s -> 10052.70s]  We're just here.
[10052.70s -> 10053.18s]  Forever.
[10053.18s -> 10054.14s]  Yeah, it's convenient.
[10054.14s -> 10056.14s]  It's nice that we haven't had any disconnects either.
[10056.14s -> 10057.90s]  It's like we're just playing the game.
[10057.90s -> 10059.74s]  Doesn't feel like in a pain in the ass.
[10059.74s -> 10059.98s]  No.
[10059.98s -> 10061.98s]  The only thing was we just had to complete the tutorial
[10061.98s -> 10063.26s]  and then that was it.
[10063.26s -> 10064.62s]  It's like 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
[10067.72s -> 10068.92s]  You're welcome.
[10068.92s -> 10072.09s]  So we have gear to craft.
[10084.76s -> 10090.00s]  He's wearing like a modern day looking mask.
[10090.00s -> 10090.72s]  What is it?
[10090.72s -> 10092.16s]  I'm gonna come find you.
[10092.80s -> 10094.96s]  Can I use this stuff here?
[10094.96s -> 10096.51s]  Oh, sick.
[10097.23s -> 10097.79s]  Oh, man.
[10097.79s -> 10099.31s]  You can make ornaments.
[10100.35s -> 10102.83s]  Okay, Vinny, I'm gonna need to do something for me.
[10102.83s -> 10104.35s]  Just stay right there.
[10105.63s -> 10107.95s]  Just turn around and look over here when I tell you.
[10110.03s -> 10111.66s]  Okay, go ahead and look.
[10111.66s -> 10113.10s]  You had the exact same idea.
[10113.10s -> 10114.78s]  I was about to do the same thing.
[10114.78s -> 10115.28s]  Yeah.
[10116.91s -> 10117.55s]  That's the...
[10117.55s -> 10118.75s]  You put this...
[10118.75s -> 10120.03s]  Oh my God, don't kill anybody.
[10120.59s -> 10123.29s]  How do I get up there though?
[10124.56s -> 10126.08s]  If I want to go up there,
[10126.64s -> 10127.84s]  I wonder if there's a way to do that.
[10129.60s -> 10130.32s]  Oh yeah, there is.
[10139.34s -> 10140.30s]  Oh, you put it in your hair.
[10145.04s -> 10147.04s]  We do have new materials from that pig, so...
[10150.96s -> 10151.36s]  Oh yeah.
[10152.48s -> 10154.48s]  I gotta find the forge.
[10154.48s -> 10156.00s]  Over by me?
[10156.64s -> 10160.35s]  Wait, what happens when you jump into the water?
[10161.07s -> 10163.69s]  Oh, you just die.
[10163.69s -> 10164.25s]  Cool.
[10164.25s -> 10165.37s]  What is that 40?
[10166.17s -> 10166.81s]  40 what?
[10167.45s -> 10172.51s]  Is that like elemental damage?
[10172.51s -> 10173.55s]  A 40 of OE.
[10185.47s -> 10186.11s]  Oh, this is...
[10186.11s -> 10186.43s]  Okay.
[10188.51s -> 10189.63s]  So that's more damage.
[10190.19s -> 10191.55s]  And so when it topples over,
[10192.11s -> 10195.39s]  I do 13% more damage if they're toppled over.
[10195.39s -> 10196.59s]  What is nimble fingered?
[10199.93s -> 10200.81s]  Oh, I can...
[10200.81s -> 10201.77s]  Yeah, I can do this now.
[10201.77s -> 10204.49s]  I can upgrade the sword.
[10204.49s -> 10204.89s]  Very cool.
[10204.89s -> 10205.69s]  Bare thread.
[10205.69s -> 10206.33s]  What does that do?
[10207.74s -> 10212.60s]  Inhibit stamina loss when Karakuri thread has run out.
[10212.60s -> 10213.10s]  Okay.
[10215.84s -> 10216.96s]  If I want to keep going down this path,
[10216.96s -> 10221.52s]  I need to kill the King Tusk probably a few more times.
[10226.54s -> 10229.50s]  You can't afford to neglect the equipment that affords you protection.
[10229.50s -> 10230.14s]  Armor mods?
[10230.14s -> 10232.09s]  Wait, wait, did I...
[10232.09s -> 10237.96s]  I'm not sure if I forged a new weapon or if I just put things...
[10237.96s -> 10239.56s]  Oh, enhance.
[10239.56s -> 10242.17s]  There's a button that says enhance.
[10242.17s -> 10243.34s]  I see.
[10243.34s -> 10244.78s]  Okay, now that's the next level.
[10244.78s -> 10248.78s]  Oh, and I can upgrade to the Creeping Vine Nodachi.
[10248.78s -> 10249.66s]  This is centered.
[10249.66s -> 10250.54s]  What does that mean?
[10250.54s -> 10253.77s]  That was like E3 gamer talk right there.
[10254.73s -> 10255.93s]  Is this centered?
[10255.93s -> 10257.13s]  Yeah, hold on.
[10257.13s -> 10257.77s]  I kind of just...
[10257.77s -> 10261.96s]  I glossed over everything it just told me.
[10261.96s -> 10265.26s]  Strong arm spirit.
[10265.26s -> 10268.62s]  It's like an evil meter.
[10268.62s -> 10269.18s]  Final blow.
[10269.18s -> 10271.02s]  Boost attack power against toppled kimono.
[10271.02s -> 10274.22s]  Boost the chance of landing critical hits for a while when Hunter's arm is activated.
[10274.22s -> 10275.18s]  I don't know what that is.
[10275.18s -> 10277.66s]  I might have just beansed it.
[10277.66s -> 10278.94s]  Is there an undo?
[10278.94s -> 10279.74s]  Oh, fuck.
[10279.74s -> 10280.24s]  No.
[10283.56s -> 10285.16s]  Used materials will be returned.
[10285.16s -> 10287.32s]  Oh, it's only a gold cost.
[10287.32s -> 10288.78s]  Yeah, that's easy.
[10288.78s -> 10289.74s]  No, I didn't blow it, chat.
[10289.74s -> 10291.05s]  It's all good.
[10291.05s -> 10292.99s]  You can get your materials back.
[10292.99s -> 10295.55s]  Oh, that's good to know.
[10295.55s -> 10298.03s]  So we need to talk to the person over...
[10298.03s -> 10298.75s]  How are you doing, by the way?
[10298.75s -> 10299.47s]  You good to...
[10299.47s -> 10300.91s]  Do you like another monster or are you good?
[10300.91s -> 10302.51s]  I can do one more fight.
[10302.51s -> 10303.01s]  Okay.
[10303.01s -> 10304.09s]  Do one more.
[10304.09s -> 10309.29s]  If you want to go kill a toppled rat or some weird slime or something.
[10309.29s -> 10315.85s]  Yeah, let's try to find the next monster.
[10315.85s -> 10316.73s]  Yeah, let's do one more.
[10316.73s -> 10324.99s]  This thing has a running fire swing.
[10324.99s -> 10326.19s]  This thing's just burning now.
[10326.19s -> 10328.35s]  Oh, that's the new thing I got.
[10328.35s -> 10329.39s]  All right, that's cool.
[10329.39s -> 10331.07s]  I get it.
[10331.07s -> 10332.35s]  So that's fire damage.
[10332.35s -> 10334.59s]  Of course it is.
[10334.59s -> 10338.30s]  Human path modification.
[10338.30s -> 10339.98s]  Kimono path modification.
[10339.98s -> 10344.86s]  Where did I shoot that thing?
[10344.86s -> 10348.38s]  There it is.
[10348.38s -> 10349.10s]  Wait a minute.
[10349.10s -> 10349.74s]  What's going on here?
[10354.16s -> 10356.88s]  We might have to climb to the roof to get on that thing that I made.
[10357.98s -> 10358.62s]  Okay.
[10358.62s -> 10359.42s]  Yeah.
[10359.42s -> 10360.62s]  Oh, yeah, I had to do that earlier.
[10363.93s -> 10365.77s]  How do you equip a different weapon?
[10365.77s -> 10366.97s]  Do you have to do that at the forge?
[10368.01s -> 10368.81s]  Change equipment.
[10368.81s -> 10373.34s]  So at that same lady, you can do change equipment.
[10373.34s -> 10374.22s]  Oh, I see.
[10374.22s -> 10374.78s]  Okay.
[10374.78s -> 10380.54s]  Someone in my chat named CostcoHotDog150, which is...
[10380.54s -> 10382.14s]  That's a great name, by the way.
[10382.14s -> 10386.62s]  Said, can you convince Jerma to drink a 40 on his stream and burp directly into his camera?
[10389.92s -> 10394.22s]  I mean, how would you convince me to do that?
[10394.22s -> 10395.66s]  I'm not going to even try.
[10395.66s -> 10400.38s]  You guys enjoying your dinner?
[10400.38s -> 10401.50s]  Not even going to try.
[10401.50s -> 10404.91s]  Oh, there's a ball over here.
[10404.91s -> 10411.45s]  No, I'm not going to drink a 40 on stream.
[10411.45s -> 10413.37s]  Have you ever done Edward 40 hands?
[10413.37s -> 10416.60s]  Do you know what that is?
[10416.60s -> 10418.96s]  Edward 40 hands.
[10418.96s -> 10424.08s]  Yeah, it's when you, like, electrical tape or duct tape two 40s to each of your hands,
[10424.08s -> 10427.44s]  and you can't, like, get rid of them until you drink them.
[10428.48s -> 10431.36s]  It's Edward 40 hands, yeah.
[10432.00s -> 10434.99s]  No, I'm not going to do that on stream.
[10434.99s -> 10437.69s]  All right, you ready to go to the new location?
[10437.69s -> 10438.57s]  Is that the new location?
[10438.57s -> 10441.85s]  I think the new location is we have to talk to this person.
[10441.85s -> 10444.11s]  Oh, I thought they were in the new location.
[10444.11s -> 10447.10s]  Yeah.
[10447.10s -> 10451.12s]  Wait, I think you have to do it, actually.
[10451.12s -> 10452.08s]  I'll do it, yeah.
[10452.08s -> 10460.60s]  Someone said, I heard you talking about Edward 40 hands, so I joined your stream instead.
[10460.60s -> 10461.39s]  That's sick.
[10461.39s -> 10462.51s]  You know what would be cool?
[10462.51s -> 10467.36s]  If everyone came to my stream and just, like, followed my stream,
[10468.48s -> 10470.08s]  that would be, like, that would be really cool.
[10470.08s -> 10470.72s]  You should do that.
[10470.72s -> 10471.36s]  And based.
[10472.08s -> 10472.72s]  And based.
[10472.72s -> 10473.52s]  Do it right now.
[10473.52s -> 10476.12s]  Even do it right.
[10476.12s -> 10478.60s]  I mean, there are almost 12,000 people here right now.
[10478.60s -> 10479.56s]  All of you better go follow.
[10479.56s -> 10480.20s]  No, no, no, no.
[10480.20s -> 10481.96s]  And you're fine right now.
[10481.96s -> 10485.98s]  You better do it right now.
[10485.98s -> 10486.54s]  What's going on?
[10487.18s -> 10490.14s]  I'll just have to get you to drink a 40 at some point, but it's fine.
[10491.34s -> 10495.88s]  It's making the bridge repairs on the old blossom trail impossible.
[10495.88s -> 10496.92s]  I'm already followed.
[10498.68s -> 10502.12s]  This is an ad for EA, but for Vinnie, I suppose so.
[10503.16s -> 10504.52s]  Wait, why can't it be both?
[10504.52s -> 10505.85s]  It can be both.
[10510.00s -> 10511.20s]  Carrie, request.
[10511.84s -> 10513.77s]  What if we talk to Toga Hime?
[10513.77s -> 10515.21s]  Is that he Hime or Hime?
[10515.21s -> 10516.41s]  I don't know how to pronounce that.
[10516.86s -> 10523.20s]  I don't know, because I'm not the host.
[10523.20s -> 10523.76s]  I can just sit here.
[10523.76s -> 10524.80s]  Wait, can I emote?
[10524.80s -> 10525.92s]  How do I do emote?
[10525.92s -> 10527.84s]  It probably is emote, right?
[10527.84s -> 10529.68s]  They're right on the D-pad.
[10535.29s -> 10537.77s]  Chat, I swear to God, I thought this was a person with no face.
[10539.28s -> 10544.73s]  Like, I thought that was their shoulders and like their head was missing.
[10544.73s -> 10545.45s]  Re-input.
[10555.90s -> 10556.62s]  OK, you are.
[10565.42s -> 10566.94s]  Dude, everybody just left your screen.
[10567.58s -> 10568.08s]  Heck!
[10570.78s -> 10575.34s]  Lots of cool and basic chat members that have just entered my channel.
[10575.34s -> 10575.98s]  Very nice.
[10575.98s -> 10576.54s]  Very cool.
[10580.70s -> 10583.42s]  I promise you, new chat members, I will not drink a 40.
[10583.42s -> 10584.54s]  I will not be on camera.
[10584.54s -> 10586.38s]  I will not eat a grilled cheese off the ground.
[10588.16s -> 10590.32s]  That seems like a little...
[10592.24s -> 10593.84s]  I don't know why you wouldn't.
[10593.84s -> 10594.72s]  Oh, no, you shouldn't.
[10595.68s -> 10597.60s]  It's not the best deal for these new viewers,
[10597.60s -> 10600.56s]  but I can make a funny noise once in a while.
[10600.56s -> 10601.06s]  Let's hear it.
[10606.16s -> 10608.16s]  What's your best funny noise besides that one?
[10610.00s -> 10610.56s]  I'll go first.
[10611.84s -> 10612.34s]  OK.
[10623.15s -> 10623.65s]  OK.
[10624.27s -> 10626.43s]  That just sounds like you ate a grilled cheese off the ground.
[10627.98s -> 10629.26s]  They are not good.
[10629.26s -> 10630.22s]  They're not being good.
[10630.22s -> 10631.66s]  Space cams should be revoked.
[10637.39s -> 10638.99s]  Show him the AI snake.
[10638.99s -> 10641.71s]  Well, there's an AI version of me like shorting out
[10641.71s -> 10644.27s]  and making like really bizarre like death throw noises.
[10644.27s -> 10645.39s]  That was a pretty funny noise.
[10647.58s -> 10649.10s]  I thought, OK, I got this.
[10652.20s -> 10653.96s]  That was really good, actually.
[10653.96s -> 10654.68s]  That was pretty good.
[10658.19s -> 10659.55s]  My name is Tinky Winky.
[10659.55s -> 10660.51s]  I'm a Teletubby.
[10660.51s -> 10661.23s]  How you doing?
[10661.23s -> 10661.73s]  Hey.
[10663.40s -> 10664.20s]  Hey, that's pretty good.
[10664.20s -> 10665.80s]  Which Teletubby is you?
[10666.28s -> 10669.96s]  I'm the one that is orange, I think.
[10671.48s -> 10672.04s]  That's actually.
[10672.68s -> 10673.32s]  Oh, my God.
[10673.32s -> 10675.96s]  We could start a TV show with these two fucking voices.
[10675.96s -> 10676.68s]  Oh, my God.
[10678.01s -> 10682.09s]  Hey, welcome to the funny kids programming show.
[10682.89s -> 10683.39s]  Yep.
[10684.17s -> 10686.49s]  You know, but on the paper when I make all the rules,
[10686.49s -> 10687.13s]  you know what I'm saying?
[10687.13s -> 10689.87s]  That's kind of like Peter Griffin.
[10689.87s -> 10691.47s]  I don't know what you're talking about, Lois.
[10691.47s -> 10694.35s]  I mean, I never even once sounded like Peter Griffin.
[10694.35s -> 10694.99s]  All right.
[10694.99s -> 10697.47s]  Vinny, you are not sponsored to play this.
[10698.27s -> 10702.75s]  But can I just commission you right now to just on my stream?
[10702.75s -> 10703.87s]  You can mute your stream.
[10703.87s -> 10707.23s]  Can you just do that but say what platforms this is on?
[10709.10s -> 10711.50s]  I don't know what platforms it's on.
[10711.50s -> 10716.14s]  It's on Xbox, X and S, PS5, and PC.
[10717.18s -> 10719.42s]  Just mute your stream until it only comes through my stream
[10719.42s -> 10721.10s]  because I have the sponsor.
[10723.36s -> 10723.86s]  OK.
[10724.48s -> 10727.84s]  So excuse me, Vinny, where could I get this if I wanted to play it?
[10729.29s -> 10730.89s]  Be happy to tell you, Jamer.
[10732.01s -> 10735.96s]  Well, it's on Xbox Series X and X.
[10737.77s -> 10741.21s]  It's also on PC and PlayStation 5.
[10741.21s -> 10741.85s]  How you doing?
[10743.92s -> 10744.96s]  He said what he said.
[10744.96s -> 10746.24s]  He already forgot.
[10748.20s -> 10749.16s]  No, I got it right.
[10749.16s -> 10749.88s]  No, you got it right.
[10751.20s -> 10752.24s]  No, that was good.
[10752.24s -> 10753.20s]  That was actually really good.
[10753.93s -> 10754.41s]  Thanks, man.
[10756.09s -> 10756.49s]  Hey, thanks.
[10756.49s -> 10757.05s]  Free, by the way.
[10757.05s -> 10757.77s]  You could have that one.
[10757.77s -> 10759.29s]  Yeah, that was that was free.
[10760.17s -> 10761.93s]  Like I said earlier, I'm just happy to be here.
[10762.81s -> 10764.09s]  I love playing games with you, dude.
[10764.09s -> 10765.05s]  It's the it's fun.
[10765.77s -> 10768.49s]  Yeah, I'm glad we started doing this more often.
[10768.49s -> 10768.97s]  Exactly.
[10768.97s -> 10770.01s]  It's exactly what I was going to say.
[10774.70s -> 10775.82s]  I appreciate you, Jerma.
[10777.34s -> 10778.22s]  Appreciate it.
[10778.78s -> 10783.12s]  Appreciate it.
[10783.12s -> 10785.60s]  All right, appreciate this.
[10785.60s -> 10786.72s]  So where are we going?
[10788.25s -> 10789.53s]  We got to kill one more monster.
[10795.08s -> 10796.36s]  Head to Spirit Island.
[10797.31s -> 10800.19s]  So I guess we have to find the exit.
[10800.19s -> 10801.23s]  Are you near the exit?
[10801.23s -> 10802.11s]  Can you like?
[10802.11s -> 10803.55s]  I don't think I can activate it.
[10803.55s -> 10805.16s]  I think you have to.
[10805.16s -> 10809.28s]  I'm very interested in this, though.
[10809.28s -> 10815.42s]  So the Costco hot dog person said you're one step closer to gaining his trust.
[10815.42s -> 10817.98s]  Like, I'm not going to have him drink a 40 for you.
[10818.54s -> 10820.54s]  Like, I can't force Jerma to do anything.
[10820.54s -> 10823.02s]  So don't like stop Costco hot dog person.
[10823.02s -> 10824.22s]  That's you're weird.
[10824.22s -> 10826.60s]  Yeah, relax.
[10826.60s -> 10827.72s]  Oh, dude, right here.
[10827.72s -> 10828.28s]  Yeah.
[10828.28s -> 10830.70s]  So here I'll depart us.
[10830.70s -> 10833.44s]  There are so many options here.
[10833.44s -> 10834.00s]  I don't even.
[10835.32s -> 10839.52s]  People are people are going to go absolutely nuts with this.
[10839.52s -> 10841.68s]  There's like dummies.
[10841.68s -> 10844.56s]  There is training dummies.
[10844.56s -> 10845.60s]  There's bulwarks.
[10845.60s -> 10849.60s]  There's there's a lot of stuff here.
[10851.07s -> 10853.85s]  Honestly, yeah, there's a there's a there's a ton of things.
[10853.85s -> 10854.89s]  This is like a trap.
[10856.03s -> 10858.83s]  Powerful leverage brings down a massive hammer with terrifying force.
[10858.83s -> 10861.87s]  A single blow can stop a kimono in its tracks and crush any horror.
[10861.87s -> 10863.63s]  So you can set up like little traps and stuff.
[10863.63s -> 10867.39s]  And this goes forever.
[10867.39s -> 10870.84s]  That's cool.
[10870.84s -> 10873.52s]  There's some this is something else to put your points into, right?
[10873.60s -> 10874.24s]  Sounds fun.
[10874.24s -> 10879.00s]  The Costco hot dogs hit different.
[10879.00s -> 10879.40s]  They are.
[10879.40s -> 10879.88s]  You know what?
[10879.88s -> 10884.08s]  I will say they're fine.
[10884.08s -> 10886.49s]  They're just cheap.
[10886.49s -> 10888.38s]  They're fine.
[10888.38s -> 10889.02s]  They're big.
[10889.02s -> 10890.48s]  There's nothing wrong with it.
[10890.48s -> 10891.84s]  No, this area is ready.
[10892.56s -> 10893.44s]  They're fine.
[10893.44s -> 10895.20s]  I like the coral.
[10896.96s -> 10898.16s]  Good source of bacteria.
[10898.16s -> 10899.04s]  That's right.
[10899.04s -> 10905.96s]  When your gut biome is in danger, just go get a Costco hot dog.
[10905.96s -> 10906.52s]  Can we swim?
[10910.97s -> 10911.61s]  Kind of like.
[10911.61s -> 10912.73s]  No, not really.
[10912.73s -> 10913.93s]  Wait, why would I be able to?
[10913.93s -> 10914.65s]  OK, never mind.
[10915.64s -> 10917.00s]  Yeah, the weapons are so huge.
[10917.00s -> 10918.28s]  They're just like weighing us to the ground.
[10919.93s -> 10920.33s]  Hi.
[10920.33s -> 10922.43s]  Ah, all right.
[10922.43s -> 10927.88s]  Would you agree that Bologna or like hot dog pancakes?
[10927.88s -> 10930.60s]  Jerma, I think we've reached the point of no return for stupidity
[10930.60s -> 10932.60s]  and I can't stop reading these chat messages.
[10932.60s -> 10933.24s]  No, go for it.
[10933.88s -> 10936.68s]  I have the choice not to read these and I can't stop myself.
[10937.42s -> 10940.46s]  Welcome to every single day of my life.
[10941.58s -> 10944.06s]  I look over and it's just somebody will just say something
[10944.06s -> 10948.28s]  that's just so just so strange that I have to address it.
[10949.08s -> 10949.88s]  Exactly.
[10949.88s -> 10953.88s]  Yeah, that's like one of the reasons Jerma and I even know each other chat
[10953.88s -> 10958.25s]  is because like our chats ended up being kind of similar
[10958.25s -> 10961.85s]  and people started noticing like just the weird like the weirdness.
[10963.55s -> 10964.91s]  Yeah, it was a meme friendship.
[10964.91s -> 10965.23s]  Yeah.
[10965.23s -> 10969.53s]  But at the same time, there is like some commonality to the to the way the chat.
[10969.53s -> 10972.25s]  I mean, I mean, we have demographics.
[10972.97s -> 10975.92s]  Vinny, I'm sure you've looked at this or there's overlap.
[10975.92s -> 10979.52s]  Yeah, I think as of two or three, four years ago,
[10979.52s -> 10984.00s]  I think you and I have shared like 30 percent of our audience together.
[10984.64s -> 10986.56s]  Something makes about like 40 percent.
[10988.60s -> 10989.16s]  It's interesting.
[10992.30s -> 10996.78s]  Weird, weird dudes the same age that make weird scenarios.
[10996.78s -> 11003.07s]  However, I will say, though, Jerma, don't get used to this, but to compliment you,
[11004.88s -> 11010.62s]  you do put a lot of effort into your bits.
[11010.62s -> 11011.10s]  I don't.
[11011.10s -> 11011.66s]  Thank you.
[11011.66s -> 11012.30s]  Yeah, you do.
[11012.30s -> 11013.02s]  I whipped cream.
[11013.58s -> 11016.92s]  Jerma, I have whipped creamed an alien.
[11016.92s -> 11018.76s]  That's that's as far as I'll go for a bit.
[11018.76s -> 11020.36s]  I'll whip cream an alien.
[11020.36s -> 11020.84s]  That's it.
[11020.84s -> 11025.66s]  Can we just talk about how pretty this area actually is?
[11025.66s -> 11026.46s]  I love this place.
[11026.46s -> 11026.78s]  I love this.
[11026.78s -> 11027.74s]  I love the beach.
[11027.74s -> 11028.91s]  This looks awesome.
[11028.91s -> 11030.99s]  This is like Chrono Cross, like one of my favorite games.
[11030.99s -> 11031.47s]  Wow.
[11031.47s -> 11032.75s]  That kind of holy shit.
[11032.75s -> 11035.28s]  You just unlocked a memory in my head.
[11035.28s -> 11035.92s]  Yeah.
[11035.92s -> 11039.74s]  That looks like I was wondering.
[11039.74s -> 11040.38s]  Yeah.
[11040.38s -> 11040.80s]  Yeah.
[11040.80s -> 11044.00s]  That game is got like some pretty areas.
[11044.00s -> 11045.04s]  Watch this.
[11045.04s -> 11046.51s]  Check this out.
[11046.51s -> 11050.76s]  Let's explore over here.
[11050.76s -> 11051.48s]  Sounds good.
[11051.48s -> 11053.93s]  Let's go up.
[11053.93s -> 11056.44s]  Why not?
[11064.96s -> 11065.68s]  Oh, you can.
[11065.68s -> 11068.32s]  You can stop mid midway.
[11068.32s -> 11070.04s]  Like you don't have to keep going.
[11070.04s -> 11071.72s]  Like you could just slow down and stuff.
[11071.72s -> 11073.47s]  I did it on purpose.
[11076.44s -> 11081.10s]  OK, we put one of those under towers.
[11081.10s -> 11082.22s]  Yeah, I could do that.
[11082.22s -> 11083.10s]  I'll throw here.
[11083.10s -> 11083.50s]  You know what?
[11083.50s -> 11084.86s]  Let me fake.
[11084.86s -> 11090.09s]  Was it the whole that gave it away?
[11090.83s -> 11092.43s]  No, it's three presentation, dude.
[11093.23s -> 11093.95s]  Dog.
[11093.95s -> 11095.79s]  I couldn't decide between dude or dog.
[11095.79s -> 11096.35s]  So I said dog.
[11097.60s -> 11098.40s]  I can put one over here.
[11103.69s -> 11104.19s]  Search.
[11106.12s -> 11106.76s]  Oh, that's right.
[11106.76s -> 11108.28s]  We had we gave Jerma a dog.
[11108.28s -> 11108.68s]  Sona.
[11108.68s -> 11109.48s]  I forgot about that.
[11110.20s -> 11111.24s]  Hey, we all got one.
[11111.80s -> 11113.08s]  Yeah, we all got one.
[11113.08s -> 11114.28s]  I don't see anything from here.
[11116.81s -> 11119.61s]  OK, I'm going to place a tower in the middle here and hope for the.
[11119.61s -> 11123.72s]  Oh, Vinnie, open your mouth.
[11123.72s -> 11128.38s]  That circle is the range of this tower.
[11128.38s -> 11131.10s]  So there is no monster in this circle.
[11131.10s -> 11132.91s]  We're going to have to keep going.
[11132.91s -> 11133.23s]  Yes.
[11133.96s -> 11137.44s]  Took me a while to figure that out.
[11137.44s -> 11138.24s]  I'll be honest.
[11138.24s -> 11142.56s]  I think I knew that, but I was not putting it into like a like active effect.
[11142.80s -> 11145.76s]  I was just like hiding the information for some reason.
[11145.76s -> 11147.92s]  But can you pet the sea animals?
[11147.92s -> 11154.99s]  You can pet the turtle.
[11154.99s -> 11155.87s]  That's cute.
[11155.87s -> 11156.75s]  Wait, he dropped it.
[11156.75s -> 11158.91s]  He gave me an item because I was nice.
[11158.91s -> 11160.67s]  Yeah, they do that when you pet them.
[11160.67s -> 11166.33s]  What about the crab?
[11166.33s -> 11169.72s]  I can even pet the crab.
[11169.72s -> 11175.72s]  I don't think they feel it like crabs wouldn't like even know what that is.
[11176.59s -> 11182.22s]  Oh, he's not very happy.
[11182.22s -> 11190.70s]  Jerma, I found like a cool pirate ship and there's like a monster on top of it.
[11190.70s -> 11191.69s]  All right.
[11191.69s -> 11192.25s]  I'm coming.
[11192.25s -> 11201.55s]  My character is going to puke.
[11201.55s -> 11201.71s]  All right.
[11201.71s -> 11202.11s]  I'm coming.
[11204.72s -> 11215.15s]  So you are all the way back there.
[11217.04s -> 11217.28s]  Yeah.
[11217.28s -> 11220.24s]  And I found a really strange looking monster.
[11220.24s -> 11225.39s]  I'm coming.
[11225.39s -> 11230.24s]  Wait, let me get some thread.
[11230.24s -> 11239.92s]  Just sounds like flipper.
[11240.64s -> 11242.16s]  Chad, you know, you hear that?
[11242.16s -> 11247.04s]  This monster conjure a torch to engulf your weapon in flames when you attack.
[11247.04s -> 11248.40s]  I think I just picked up something to do that.
[11249.04s -> 11249.52s]  Oh, wow.
[11250.16s -> 11250.48s]  Okay.
[11257.02s -> 11264.62s]  Oh, Suno Bashiri.
[11265.26s -> 11267.05s]  Are we doing this?
[11268.72s -> 11270.16s]  I'm fighting this one over here.
[11270.16s -> 11270.56s]  I don't know.
[11271.52s -> 11273.20s]  This thing is going for it.
[11273.20s -> 11275.12s]  Yeah, it's really fast and it sounds like flipper.
[11290.36s -> 11291.00s]  Yeah, this thing's quick.
[11292.68s -> 11294.04s]  It does have like a dolphin sound.
[11294.04s -> 11294.92s]  You were good.
[11294.92s -> 11295.32s]  Come back.
[11296.12s -> 11300.27s]  Vinny, that's called a dolphin.
[11300.27s -> 11300.51s]  Yeah.
[11300.51s -> 11304.56s]  No, I just wanted to be even more specific with my reference.
[11304.56s -> 11305.04s]  That's all.
[11305.04s -> 11305.60s]  What's it doing?
[11309.68s -> 11312.48s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[11312.48s -> 11315.45s]  I okay.
[11315.45s -> 11316.81s]  That was pretty ridiculous.
[11320.92s -> 11322.12s]  Oh, do it.
[11322.12s -> 11322.52s]  Damn it.
[11322.52s -> 11323.00s]  Not in the head.
[11323.64s -> 11326.44s]  Come on.
[11327.16s -> 11330.38s]  Oh, didn't hit pounders can do.
[11330.38s -> 11330.62s]  All right.
[11330.62s -> 11333.02s]  So three springs makes a pounder.
[11333.82s -> 11339.04s]  Watch this.
[11339.04s -> 11340.16s]  Oh, man.
[11342.08s -> 11342.32s]  Yeah.
[11342.32s -> 11345.20s]  Three springs on top of each other makes like a big hammer that swings down.
[11346.00s -> 11352.67s]  Ready to go.
[11365.37s -> 11366.09s]  That's amazing.
[11366.89s -> 11374.17s]  Oh, shit.
[11376.20s -> 11379.64s]  Yeah, I'm like a little too slow for this enemy right now.
[11379.64s -> 11380.76s]  Then again, you have a hammer.
[11380.76s -> 11385.08s]  So honestly, you using the springs gets a knockdown if you get it right in the head.
[11405.15s -> 11405.39s]  Shit.
[11408.48s -> 11409.60s]  I'm trying to climb up there.
[11413.45s -> 11414.17s]  Stop camping.
[11414.81s -> 11430.49s]  Oh, I'm out of materials.
[11431.13s -> 11432.88s]  Is there any materials like any threads?
[11434.16s -> 11434.72s]  You know what?
[11434.72s -> 11440.64s]  I thought maybe the weak point, but this enemy might be too small to grab thread from.
[11448.36s -> 11449.00s]  Oh, shit.
[11449.56s -> 11453.95s]  Did I get it?
[11453.95s -> 11454.19s]  No.
[11458.48s -> 11459.76s]  So fucking fast.
[11464.97s -> 11465.21s]  Shit.
[11465.21s -> 11465.85s]  I don't have any more.
[11467.60s -> 11468.96s]  Whoa, did you get it?
[11468.96s -> 11469.92s]  Now's the time.
[11469.92s -> 11470.72s]  Yeah, now's the time.
[11476.91s -> 11477.15s]  Yes.
[11477.79s -> 11480.08s]  Oh, I got the big hit.
[11482.36s -> 11483.16s]  All right, he's running.
[11487.45s -> 11491.05s]  All right, let's try to get some thread, too, because that hammer move is so good.
[11491.85s -> 11494.46s]  You can collect it from a lot of places.
[11495.76s -> 11498.40s]  Someone said they keep hearing the Splatoon disconnect sound.
[11499.20s -> 11500.00s]  It's the same thing.
[11500.00s -> 11502.88s]  It's just like a water drop with a reverb.
[11503.84s -> 11512.38s]  The threads.
[11513.02s -> 11516.01s]  Threads over here.
[11516.73s -> 11522.01s]  I found some, too.
[11522.57s -> 11526.65s]  If you hold down left trigger, you can see what gives you.
[11526.65s -> 11528.89s]  Yeah, it's like it's like spider vision.
[11541.02s -> 11545.07s]  You're going to want to see this on my way.
[11545.07s -> 11546.27s]  Yeah, it was very odd.
[11547.07s -> 11557.96s]  Oh, is this the same thing we were attacking before?
[11558.92s -> 11559.40s]  Smash it.
[11560.12s -> 11560.60s]  Oh, it is.
[11560.60s -> 11561.16s]  Yeah, it's mad.
[11570.14s -> 11571.74s]  Oh, don't die here.
[11572.54s -> 11575.36s]  What did you just make?
[11576.65s -> 11577.53s]  Pounder.
[11577.53s -> 11578.57s]  Oh, that was a pounder.
[11579.63s -> 11587.87s]  Yep.
[11587.87s -> 11589.31s]  Oh, opportunity.
[11591.36s -> 11592.16s]  Nice.
[11592.16s -> 11594.80s]  Just did like 396 damage or 68 rather.
[11595.68s -> 11597.80s]  Stay right here.
[11598.84s -> 11599.64s]  I got 250.
[11606.83s -> 11608.59s]  Oh, that would have been fucking awesome.
[11609.31s -> 11610.11s]  Whatever.
[11610.11s -> 11625.04s]  A lot of materials over here.
[11625.60s -> 11628.32s]  Jerma, if you walk into the torch, your weapon will.
[11628.32s -> 11630.64s]  Oh, oh, he put it out.
[11631.28s -> 11636.00s]  I don't know the big sack bounce.
[11636.80s -> 11638.72s]  Oh, that hurts a lot.
[11638.72s -> 11639.36s]  I am dead.
[11644.96s -> 11645.52s]  Thank God.
[11645.52s -> 11646.16s]  He ran away.
[11646.88s -> 11650.46s]  All right.
[11650.46s -> 11651.90s]  Healing, healing, healing.
[11651.90s -> 11652.30s]  Thank you.
[11653.18s -> 11656.06s]  Dammit.
[11659.00s -> 11659.32s]  Smash.
[11661.64s -> 11663.56s]  Oh, missed.
[11669.28s -> 11669.60s]  Nice.
[11670.24s -> 11672.54s]  No stun, though.
[11673.42s -> 11674.22s]  Oh, I got sacked.
[11675.18s -> 11675.90s]  Not too bad.
[11675.90s -> 11677.10s]  Oh, you got worse than I did.
[11677.10s -> 11677.74s]  Yeah, that hurt.
[11678.54s -> 11682.49s]  All right.
[11682.49s -> 11685.13s]  Seems to be out of that weird like intense mode.
[11701.04s -> 11702.96s]  Do you have any materials for this?
[11702.96s -> 11703.92s]  I got no materials.
[11704.64s -> 11705.04s]  All out.
[11705.84s -> 11706.88s]  I think we're pretty close, though.
[11707.60s -> 11709.44s]  Yeah, it should shouldn't be too much longer.
[11709.44s -> 11710.56s]  What the hell?
[11710.56s -> 11711.12s]  That was weird.
[11719.23s -> 11722.04s]  Running materials.
[11723.47s -> 11724.83s]  Yeah, there's a crystal over here.
[11724.83s -> 11725.33s]  Yep.
[11725.79s -> 11727.63s]  This is also one of those dragon things.
[11728.35s -> 11731.29s]  All right.
[11731.29s -> 11733.45s]  Is that a wooden horse?
[11734.33s -> 11738.20s]  All right.
[11738.20s -> 11739.16s]  I got full threads.
[11743.44s -> 11744.96s]  Finding a lot of these balls.
[11744.96s -> 11746.00s]  Oh, here comes trouble.
[11752.57s -> 11753.77s]  Yeah, this is a wooden horse.
[11754.41s -> 11755.66s]  Can we break it?
[11756.70s -> 11758.41s]  I don't think so.
[11760.96s -> 11763.20s]  Where did where'd our friend go?
[11763.20s -> 11764.24s]  Oh, down that way.
[11764.24s -> 11765.04s]  Very far away.
[11766.00s -> 11771.61s]  Oh, we're saying funny comedic line.
[11771.61s -> 11772.73s]  Oh, I see what you're doing.
[11773.61s -> 11778.52s]  Jerma, we're gonna we're gonna do this.
[11778.52s -> 11779.02s]  Ready?
[11779.56s -> 11782.49s]  You're talking about dropping down from
[11783.88s -> 11785.96s]  I'm dropping down from the zip line.
[11785.96s -> 11786.84s]  I think I fucked up.
[11786.84s -> 11787.16s]  Hang on.
[11787.16s -> 11787.56s]  Hang on.
[11787.56s -> 11788.20s]  Let me try again.
[11788.20s -> 11789.24s]  We could do that.
[11789.24s -> 11790.60s]  We could we could zip up here.
[11790.60s -> 11792.04s]  Maybe now we get this.
[11793.40s -> 11794.35s]  All right.
[11794.35s -> 11796.99s]  If we get this, there needs to be only pogs in the chat.
[11800.64s -> 11801.44s]  Okay.
[11801.44s -> 11804.16s]  So you take one up here and then jump off from here.
[11804.96s -> 11807.28s]  Maybe I'm not sure I did a good job with this.
[11809.16s -> 11811.24s]  No, we're getting close, dude.
[11811.24s -> 11811.96s]  Never mind.
[11811.96s -> 11813.32s]  It was still cool.
[11813.32s -> 11814.68s]  It's not even the same monster.
[11815.40s -> 11815.88s]  It's not?
[11816.68s -> 11816.92s]  No.
[11817.48s -> 11818.04s]  What?
[11818.04s -> 11820.20s]  Oh, this is yeah, this is like a peacock.
[11821.00s -> 11821.96s]  What the fuck is this?
[11827.28s -> 11828.80s]  Where did the monster go?
[11830.40s -> 11830.96s]  Down here?
[11840.32s -> 11841.12s]  Uh, come over here.
[11841.68s -> 11844.88s]  Did you find it?
[11844.88s -> 11846.00s]  I think it's down here.
[11847.12s -> 11848.72s]  Let's activate this.
[11848.72s -> 11848.96s]  All right.
[11850.51s -> 11850.83s]  Ready?
[11851.47s -> 11853.96s]  That's it.
[11853.96s -> 11854.20s]  Right?
[11854.20s -> 11854.44s]  Yep.
[11854.44s -> 11854.92s]  Right here.
[11854.92s -> 11855.24s]  All right.
[11855.24s -> 11855.96s]  Pogs in the chat.
[11860.32s -> 11860.56s]  No!
[11861.28s -> 11861.60s]  What?
[11861.60s -> 11862.16s]  Did you get it?
[11865.15s -> 11866.11s]  So I certainly didn't.
[11866.11s -> 11868.11s]  I just felt flat on my fucking face.
[11869.87s -> 11870.99s]  We died.
[11870.99s -> 11871.79s]  Yeah, we died.
[11872.59s -> 11873.15s]  It's all right.
[11873.15s -> 11875.15s]  That was really oh my god.
[11875.15s -> 11877.47s]  I thought that was going to do like 10,000 damage.
[11877.47s -> 11878.19s]  No, we didn't die.
[11878.19s -> 11878.75s]  We didn't die.
[11878.75s -> 11879.15s]  We didn't die.
[11879.15s -> 11879.63s]  No, we're good.
[11879.63s -> 11879.87s]  We're good.
[11879.87s -> 11880.27s]  We're good.
[11880.91s -> 11881.23s]  All right.
[11881.87s -> 11882.43s]  Oh my god.
[11882.43s -> 11884.03s]  I thought that was going to do like a hundred K.
[11886.27s -> 11886.91s]  That's sad.
[11891.80s -> 11892.28s]  All right.
[11892.28s -> 11892.92s]  I'm engaging.
[11901.44s -> 11901.92s]  Big hit.
[11906.81s -> 11918.22s]  Damn it.
[11918.22s -> 11918.54s]  Nice.
[11918.54s -> 11919.10s]  That was perfect.
[11920.64s -> 11921.28s]  No stun though.
[11921.92s -> 11925.71s]  I just got.
[11925.71s -> 11925.95s]  Wow.
[11925.95s -> 11926.99s]  He knocked me into the water.
[11932.30s -> 11932.70s]  Damn it.
[11939.87s -> 11941.79s]  That was an unbelievable amount of damage.
[11942.51s -> 11944.14s]  Oh, it's okay.
[11944.14s -> 11944.54s]  This is it.
[11945.34s -> 11951.13s]  I just always horn knocked off.
[11951.93s -> 11957.36s]  I think we did it.
[11958.00s -> 11958.24s]  Nice.
[11959.04s -> 11960.62s]  You can do the final.
[11961.26s -> 11962.62s]  No, you can do the honors.
[11962.62s -> 11963.10s]  Okay.
[11963.10s -> 11965.50s]  I want to see a hammer lodged into its cranium anyway.
[11969.07s -> 11969.95s]  Crash.
[11969.95s -> 11970.97s]  Wait, what happened?
[11971.77s -> 11972.49s]  Oh, okay.
[11972.49s -> 11972.81s]  I see.
[11978.36s -> 11979.80s]  I think the horn came off.
[11979.80s -> 11980.44s]  That's crazy.
[11982.27s -> 11982.59s]  Cool.
[11983.60s -> 11984.08s]  Glider.
[11984.64s -> 11988.80s]  Make sure you get the horn.
[11992.97s -> 11996.01s]  It's also like, yeah, we don't even have to initiate a hunt.
[11996.01s -> 11998.49s]  We just like are just hunting.
[11998.49s -> 11999.61s]  You can just kind of go wherever you want.
[12000.33s -> 12000.57s]  Yeah.
[12002.51s -> 12004.03s]  Now you can conjure gliders.
[12008.68s -> 12008.92s]  Yeah.
[12008.92s -> 12012.16s]  The tools, I think.
[12013.20s -> 12014.48s]  Dude, I'm in a helicopter.
[12015.04s -> 12017.12s]  All right.
[12017.12s -> 12017.68s]  That's pretty cool.
[12019.02s -> 12023.18s]  You probably figure out what you want to use for a loadout for this stuff.
[12024.40s -> 12024.96s]  I imagine.
[12024.96s -> 12028.08s]  Yeah, you probably choose when you unlock a bunch of them.
[12028.08s -> 12031.84s]  Because at some point, you're going to have a couple dozen of these, right?
[12031.84s -> 12035.50s]  So, I mean, you kind of have to choose what you want.
[12035.50s -> 12036.38s]  Wind vortex.
[12040.56s -> 12043.47s]  How did you get the glider?
[12043.47s -> 12044.91s]  What happens when you stack gliders?
[12045.63s -> 12047.15s]  I think you have it now too, no?
[12047.15s -> 12048.19s]  Do I?
[12048.19s -> 12051.55s]  Is it in that Karakuri menu or no?
[12051.55s -> 12055.21s]  Yeah, it's a A button.
[12055.21s -> 12056.33s]  Oh, so we just have it now?
[12057.05s -> 12057.29s]  Yeah.
[12057.93s -> 12059.05s]  Or you could just take one of mine.
[12059.61s -> 12070.89s]  What are the physics of this?
[12070.89s -> 12071.77s]  How does this even work?
[12072.33s -> 12073.37s]  I think it just kind of floats around.
[12077.39s -> 12078.11s]  Well, that was fun.
[12080.27s -> 12081.07s]  Are you good?
[12082.11s -> 12082.75s]  I'm done.
[12082.75s -> 12083.63s]  I'm going to go to sleep.
[12083.63s -> 12084.83s]  I'm tired.
[12084.83s -> 12088.59s]  But I actually enjoyed this more than I expected to.
[12090.43s -> 12091.31s]  Not to say it like that.
[12091.31s -> 12095.31s]  But once you start fighting and getting the mechanics, it is fun.
[12095.31s -> 12096.91s]  Mechanically, the game is sound.
[12096.91s -> 12098.11s]  And I like the monsters.
[12098.99s -> 12101.63s]  So I'm ready to go to sleep now.
[12101.63s -> 12104.35s]  Like other games like this, like in Monster Hunter or whatever,
[12105.15s -> 12110.41s]  you really do need to play for like an hour or two before it's like, oh, I get it.
[12110.41s -> 12115.74s]  OK, because after the first couple of hours, we just kind of learn what
[12115.74s -> 12119.90s]  is when you first get shown this new mechanic, it's kind of like, what the fuck is this?
[12119.90s -> 12120.46s]  What is this?
[12121.66s -> 12122.54s]  And then it's like, oh, wait.
[12122.54s -> 12126.78s]  Oh, oh, yeah, no, it's pretty much.
[12127.58s -> 12128.14s]  Yeah, it was good.
[12128.14s -> 12130.54s]  And it was just good playing playing game with your germ.
[12130.54s -> 12131.66s]  No, I enjoyed this.
[12132.94s -> 12134.78s]  Thanks for I mean, I reached out.
[12135.02s -> 12136.62s]  It was like, hey, you want to do this?
[12136.62s -> 12139.71s]  So Vinny was was cool enough to jump in.
[12139.71s -> 12143.24s]  So yeah, well, thanks for the invite.
[12144.12s -> 12146.01s]  I'm going to quit out.
[12146.01s -> 12147.45s]  And yeah, thanks, everybody.
[12147.45s -> 12151.21s]  And German chat, thank you for like bringing your unhinged chat messages
[12151.21s -> 12152.49s]  to my chat for a little bit.
[12152.49s -> 12153.76s]  That was fun.
[12153.76s -> 12157.40s]  And yeah, I'm sure we'll play more stuff in the future.
[12157.40s -> 12158.12s]  But thanks, man.
[12158.12s -> 12159.08s]  Have a good night.
[12159.08s -> 12159.88s]  Yeah, you too.
[12159.88s -> 12161.48s]  Thanks for coming up.
[12161.48s -> 12161.98s]  See you.
[12164.06s -> 12165.18s]  That was Vinny.
[12165.18s -> 12167.08s]  Fine sauce.
[12167.08s -> 12167.88s]  Awesome, dude.
[12167.88s -> 12174.92s]  Because I figured playing a game like this multiplayer is kind of more interesting anyways,
[12174.92s -> 12176.72s]  for me at least.
[12176.72s -> 12183.40s]  And that is going to conclude the sponsor part of the stream.
[12183.40s -> 12185.96s]  Like Vinny said, I'm pleasantly surprised.
[12185.96s -> 12190.86s]  Took a little bit to kind of get the feel of things, but it's really fun.
[12190.86s -> 12193.66s]  I have to imagine that there'll probably be some patches for it.
[12194.83s -> 12196.03s]  It's on everything again.
[12196.03s -> 12198.03s]  EA, thank you for sponsoring this part of the stream.
[12198.03s -> 12199.79s]  That was really, really cool.
[12199.79s -> 12203.66s]  I very much enjoyed that time.
[12203.66s -> 12206.86s]  Multiplayer was smooth in a game like this.
[12206.86s -> 12209.66s]  Like I said, that's probably the number one feature that,
[12209.66s -> 12213.66s]  I know I keep harping on it, but I keep talking about it.
[12215.96s -> 12222.14s]  That's really nice to not just be able to jump in and just play.
[12222.14s -> 12223.82s]  But yeah, thank you, EA.
[12223.82s -> 12225.18s]  That concludes this part of the stream.
[12225.18s -> 12226.22s]  We're going to move on.
[12226.22s -> 12229.28s]  I'm going to go back to last hero of nostalgia.
[12229.28s -> 12239.63s]  That was Wild Hearts, available now on pretty much every platform,
[12239.63s -> 12240.75s]  every current platform.
[12240.75s -> 12242.03s]  So I'm going to take a break.
[12242.03s -> 12242.59s]  I'll be right back.
[12242.59s -> 12248.62s]  I'm going to pee, maybe get some more water,
[12248.62s -> 12251.26s]  and we will play some more.
[12251.26s -> 12252.14s]  Be right back.
