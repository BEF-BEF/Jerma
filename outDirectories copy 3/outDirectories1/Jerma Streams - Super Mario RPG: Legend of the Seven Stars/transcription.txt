[1.08s -> 13.06s]  What is going on in this chat room? This is just- it's just a bunch of words. Just nonsense words.
[13.78s -> 29.75s]  Wait, what do you mean Nightbot? Nightbot isn't modded? What? How? That makes no sense. What?
[32.31s -> 42.06s]  Where is Nightbot? Where is he? So there's this Nightbot. Wait, I can't see. Not- I gotta-
[43.26s -> 53.38s]  Nightbot isn't- why is Nightbot not modded? What the fuck? All right, now it's- now you-
[53.38s -> 72.90s]  all the fun is over and now I understand. Okay, I see. You've been purged. Yeah, Nightbot is
[72.90s -> 80.97s]  my security guard who's sleeping at his desk. I just had to go and like shake his desk for a second.
[81.69s -> 88.50s]  Okay, I just shook my desk and all my fucking monitors are screwed up. Hold on, what the
[88.50s -> 94.38s]  fuck just happened? I just shook my desk and my- my desktop on my computer flickered and all my
[94.38s -> 100.46s]  icons have moved and my- hold on, I think my display thing pulled out. Yep, okay, I don't know
[100.46s -> 106.46s]  what to do about this. Yeah, okay, well it doesn't matter. I have three monitors and the middle
[106.46s -> 112.94s]  monitor's DVI cable just got unplugged. It's okay because we don't need it. What do we need that for?
[115.38s -> 122.01s]  You understand? You know what we're doing tonight, right? By popular demand, and I do mean popular,
[122.73s -> 135.03s]  we're going to play my favorite video game of all time. Ever. I have a top five.
[138.44s -> 145.24s]  It's up there. It's probably number one or two or three. I don't know. It's definitely in the-
[145.24s -> 150.92s]  I would say, you know, it's not fair to have a top five video games you've ever played in your whole
[150.92s -> 159.37s]  life. They're all number one. You don't get to choose in that point, I don't think. We're going
[159.37s -> 166.58s]  to play Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars. Now when you ask me why are we doing that,
[168.33s -> 172.41s]  because a few weeks ago we talked about our favorite games and would you ever stream some
[172.41s -> 176.89s]  of your old favorites or have like a nostalgia relaxing kind of stream night and I'm like,
[176.89s -> 184.09s]  I don't know. I've played them a lot. Probably not. But then I just said, fuck it. Sure, why not?
[185.16s -> 196.76s]  So we're going to play Mario RPG. That's the plan. Didn't you say Chrono Trigger was your
[196.76s -> 206.01s]  favorite? They're all my favorites. There's five or six of them. I have beaten this game many times,
[206.01s -> 212.09s]  although I don't remember everything every time, right? Small details get lost. Even some of the
[212.09s -> 220.09s]  large details do as well. But I do end up playing through this game like once every three to four
[220.09s -> 229.48s]  years. It's a great one. If you've never seen this game, you've never played it, then you're in for
[229.48s -> 236.68s]  a treat. In fact, if you've never played this game before, just go get it and delete me from
[236.68s -> 241.48s]  right now. There's no, just enjoy it. It's a fucking fantastic or experience it with all of us
[241.48s -> 256.22s]  if you want to. And why don't we switch over to it right now? This, by the way, has some of the best
[256.22s -> 264.14s]  music ever from any video game. Uh, Yoko Shimomura, I believe, uh, is the composer.
[264.14s -> 274.14s]  And I am a purist when it comes to this kind of things. This is Mario. This is not Jeremy. This
[274.14s -> 284.06s]  is not Jax. This is Super Mario. I'm not going to name, all the characters have to be their actual
[284.06s -> 294.95s]  names. I can't do it. Because every conversation that comes up throughout the course of this entire
[294.95s -> 304.01s]  game, it's Mario, Mario, Mario, hey Mario, Mario. I don't want to be called Peter. I don't want to
[304.01s -> 312.49s]  be called pee pants. Hey, pee pants. Hey, uh, Larry. No, this is Mario. If there was character
[312.49s -> 320.63s]  customization, sure. If I could change Mario's hat and pants color and take his mustache off and
[320.63s -> 327.45s]  make his nose bigger, okay, then that's not Mario. But it is. I'm going to do it just like it shows
[327.45s -> 340.86s]  up on TV. No, I'm not going to do Jario. I can't do that. This is, that's Mario right there. What
[340.86s -> 348.65s]  do you mean boring? No, it's, you're, you're ruining my childhood. Settle down. This is Super
[348.65s -> 384.42s]  Mario. No, I'm going to, I'm supposed to be relaxing. Hold on. Hold on. You know what's funny about
[384.42s -> 397.14s]  this? Everybody when they were younger just made this their name. And it's not correct.
[400.73s -> 406.95s]  You would go to Blockbuster and rent this shit. And there would be a few save files from people
[407.27s -> 410.39s]  that got, I don't know, a 10th of the way through the game. And it was like Steve,
[411.11s -> 418.30s]  Matt, Andrew, Catherine. Nobody ever did Mario. And it's, that's who that is.
[444.30s -> 466.47s]  No, I can't do that. I'm a purist. It's going to be Mario. Come on. Let's go. Who the fuck is Ralph?
[469.02s -> 486.41s]  Oh shit. It's right. I rented this from Blockbuster. That's right. Sometimes I forget where I got it.
[487.05s -> 491.30s]  This is Zack.
[495.38s -> 499.06s]  Calm the fuck down. This is not like an exciting game. It is. All right. Quiet.
[522.12s -> 533.02s]  The game starts off like any other Mario game. You got Bowser. You got Princess. You've got the
[533.02s -> 553.43s]  castle. And you got Mario. We get in there. Ah, I remember this. Yep. Wow. So you can jump. You can
[553.43s -> 563.43s]  run. That's pretty much what you do in every Mario game that you've ever played. You can jump.
[563.43s -> 568.49s]  No, you can't. See, I'm one of these, this is, I, this is my favorite kind of RPG. Oh, Jeremy,
[568.49s -> 573.45s]  how come you don't like most RPGs turn-based? Because I don't like having to randomly fight
[573.45s -> 579.29s]  enemies. Chrono Trigger did the same shit. You don't have to fight people. You can just run
[579.29s -> 583.77s]  around them. There's no random battles. I hate random battles. I want to see them on the screen.
[584.57s -> 591.85s]  Anyways, you got a B and A and X and a Y like the Super Nintendo controller. A Y, by the way,
[591.85s -> 598.73s]  is your special moves. B is defense and running away. X is items and A is attack. Now this game
[599.53s -> 612.20s]  implemented one of the, I've made this video. I've already made this video. I'm getting nostalgia
[612.20s -> 618.18s]  not on the game, but on the video that I made like six years ago. Yes, there are timed hits
[618.18s -> 621.38s]  and there are timed defenses as well. And usually I'm pretty good at this, but you know, it's been a
[621.38s -> 631.13s]  few years. I didn't get it. It's right after he lands. So it's like do, do, do, A. A is time,
[635.58s -> 641.26s]  A is timed hits when you block and when you are attacking. Although I'm not getting experience
[641.26s -> 644.38s]  right now. That's why I don't want to really do much of this. So I just want to get through it
[645.42s -> 657.30s]  because this is the tutorial essential. This is a walkthrough. Yes, it's not. By the way,
[657.30s -> 662.90s]  some fun trivia for you. This is the first isometric 3D-esque game that Nintendo decided to
[662.90s -> 669.58s]  release. This game did not do that well because it was released at the very end of the Super
[669.58s -> 675.26s]  Nintendo's life cycle, which as you know, most of the other consoles were already being released by
[675.26s -> 683.74s]  then. It is a cult classic status at this point and because it sucks. I'm not kidding. Actually
[683.74s -> 690.02s]  ban that person for at least 10 minutes. Like, I mean, that's, that's a 10 minute timeout. Like,
[690.02s -> 698.90s]  how dare you. Don't let Bowser bruise you, Mario. Mario, prepare your chef for a great beyond.
[702.22s -> 708.34s]  It's a block. Every time I grab my head, that means that I did it.
[708.98s -> 716.39s]  You want to see what a non-timed hit looks like. See, you can take zero damage in this game.
[716.39s -> 721.83s]  Mario, the chain. Aim for the chain. See, if this is the first time playing, you'd be like, wait,
[721.83s -> 727.35s]  what? Oh, what the fuck? I can aim for the chain. And you'd go, what? Oh, no, I know. I'm like,
[727.35s -> 739.74s]  brain is pro. Hit the chain. Drop Bowser. Sounds like a plan. 15 damage. You guys want to see what
[739.74s -> 744.28s]  a non-timed hit looks like? Because I, Toads are going to come out and explain all of this
[744.28s -> 747.24s]  and about it. Yeah, I'm giving you spoilers. I don't want to like be the person that says,
[747.24s -> 750.36s]  we're going to watch the movie and then I'm going to tell you everything that happens in the movie.
[750.36s -> 757.83s]  Toads in this game. That's all you need to know. Mario, the chain. I am aiming for the chain.
[757.91s -> 772.78s]  That's what I'm doing. Boom. What was that sound? No. It's a chain reaction. Hang on,
[772.78s -> 797.59s]  Pink Link. Coming, Mario. Fight, Mario. Fight. Fight. This should finish you. I can't do it.
[797.59s -> 800.87s]  I was going to do the, you know what I'm talking about, the, when he, you know what I mean.
[804.06s -> 809.90s]  Ah, did you think I was just going to give it to you? You're always in my way. This is it.
[810.62s -> 828.58s]  I'm going to take you out, Mario. Foiled again. Shit. Oh, Mario. You had me so worried. Let's get
[828.58s -> 838.71s]  out of here. Now what the heck's happening here? You're probably saying, wait, well, this is not,
[838.71s -> 843.27s]  this is Mario beats Bowser. Princess Peach, they don't go back. They had, they, they,
[843.27s -> 850.63s]  and that's it. But who the fuck is this guy? That's somebody I've never seen before.
[851.88s -> 869.22s]  Ooh, we're in the castle, didn't we? Super Mario RPG. You're feeling sleepy. Very sleepy.
[871.06s -> 876.26s]  And there go the stars that were broken from the sword. And here's the overworld map. We get
[876.26s -> 882.09s]  launched over here. What happened here? The sword went right into Mario's head.
[885.32s -> 896.15s]  Don't narrate this anymore. I can't, I'm sorry. I know I really am. Like, the sword drops down,
[896.15s -> 901.43s]  and what happens here? We got a rob. I'm like the fucking audio book. All right. All right.
[901.43s -> 910.68s]  I'm good. Hey, Mario. Lots of people use something called a door to go in and out of their houses.
[911.80s -> 922.94s]  Anyway, I came by to pick up Toad School since she's a bit late. Quiet, Archer. Thanks in 10
[922.94s -> 932.02s]  community subs. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You can jump on the bed. Go turn the
[932.02s -> 944.50s]  light on. Watch is ready. Good night. All right. What else can we do here? Lots of stuff.
[946.76s -> 953.06s]  Here we go. First save point of the game. The save points scattered around.
[955.70s -> 974.92s]  Fucking Ralph. Oh, no. Ralph save. Actually, I feel bad about Ralph save.
[975.64s -> 982.07s]  Ralph's not even, I don't think a real person. Hey, I thought the princess was here with you,
[982.07s -> 986.47s]  Mario. Where is she? I hate this. I hate this. Nobody can do Toad unless you do that.
[987.11s -> 995.29s]  Toad is just Marge, but a little higher pitched. Mario, what's with the silent treatment? No,
[995.29s -> 1001.29s]  I'm not going to do that. You're not telling me something. It's Bowser again, isn't it? Oh,
[1001.29s -> 1005.13s]  no. Here we go again. Mario, would you please bring it back like you always do?
[1006.01s -> 1018.78s]  It's worse. It's not worse. It's better. Let's go up to Bowser's key. Mike Tyson.
[1021.19s -> 1037.80s]  Who goes there? A trespasser. This castle now belongs to us, the Smithy Gang. It's our first
[1037.80s -> 1043.40s]  step towards taking over this world. And if it weren't for nosy characters like you,
[1044.36s -> 1050.04s]  we'd practically own this world. So let's see you deal with this.
[1063.77s -> 1085.38s]  Took out the bridge. So we, I mean, what do we do now? Why does this guy sound exactly like
[1085.38s -> 1099.61s]  a Jerma character? Because I'm sitting here doing that. All right, let's go. I'm excited. I love
[1099.61s -> 1107.21s]  this game. All right, Jay Leno, Mike Tyson, or Toad? Which one do you want me to do? Pick one.
[1108.17s -> 1119.77s]  I'm seeing a lot of Leno. Okay. You're back so soon. Did you forget something? No? What happened
[1119.77s -> 1131.58s]  up there? The bridge to Bowser's key was out now. It's just wonderful. I don't know what we must
[1131.58s -> 1140.38s]  bring out from the Chancellor of Mushroom Kingdom at once. Let's go, Mario. From the Chancellor of
[1140.38s -> 1153.14s]  what's going on. Where do we go? Oh, excuse me. Oh, that bump on your head reduced your HP level.
[1153.78s -> 1162.12s]  One of Mushroom Kingdom's famous items out of pink. The mic. Received a mushroom. Do you know
[1162.12s -> 1168.04s]  how to use items? Of course I do, Toad. Oh, I see. You're just so well traveled and experienced,
[1168.04s -> 1179.82s]  Mario. Now, why did I rush back? I had something to tell you. Oh, I remember. I came to warn you
[1179.82s -> 1185.50s]  that mushroom was swarming with monsters. I just barely made it back here in one piece.
[1186.30s -> 1192.31s]  This is Meowth. You're right. Mario, please do something. Perhaps I can help. Do you know
[1192.31s -> 1199.61s]  about Time Tits? Yes. Hey, you better watch out. He knows about Time Tits. He's going to punch
[1199.61s -> 1209.19s]  your lights out. He's got more black than white, huh? Why did I rush back? I had something to tell
[1209.19s -> 1215.13s]  you. Oh, that's right. We need to tell the Chancellor about Toadstool. I'll see you over
[1215.13s -> 1219.69s]  at Mushroom Kingdom. Have you seen this? Have you heard about it? Just in case, take these with you.
[1220.57s -> 1236.17s]  Three mushrooms. The Chancellor. I'm so glad Germa isn't an actor.
[1237.75s -> 1245.35s]  You know, you don't get me. What? I've played this game 500 times. I'm just having some fun
[1245.35s -> 1258.63s]  with the voices. All right. You want me to really give you acting? Fine. On the next dialogue,
[1258.63s -> 1261.35s]  you'll see what a real actor looks like. But first of all, we want to do this because this
[1261.35s -> 1276.71s]  is the best song in the game. The battle music is the best. The mushrooms heal you, as you probably
[1277.35s -> 1282.10s]  I blocked that. It was too much damage. What?
[1285.75s -> 1292.54s]  You get random events like that. HP max. That's good. The boss music's about. Yeah, the boss
[1292.54s -> 1301.93s]  music is very good as well. Yeah, this is also back when Mario punched hard with both hands.
[1303.14s -> 1308.18s]  Now he kicks and flips, right? This experience. I don't really need this right now, but let's
[1308.18s -> 1318.44s]  go ahead and get the coins because the coins are currency. You use these to buy stuff at the shops
[1319.08s -> 1335.70s]  and upgrade weapons. And let's, you know, let's save toad. Yeah. Toad gives you useful stuff as
[1335.70s -> 1341.03s]  you go through. To exp. Now I have to figure out how I want to do this. All right.
[1344.79s -> 1348.71s]  My life was flashing before my eyes for a second there. Here's a little something.
[1348.71s -> 1369.14s]  Thanks. I appreciate it. Oh, this is fine. Cause the experience you level up. That's not a toad
[1369.14s -> 1382.62s]  voice. Don't worry. I'm just getting warmed up. Now there are hidden blocks in the game, as you
[1382.62s -> 1393.45s]  probably could have guessed. What are my first impressions of the game? Um, I don't know. Not
[1393.45s -> 1398.89s]  that good. I mean, it's like, what is, I don't understand. It's an RPG, like turn-based. I fight
[1398.89s -> 1405.85s]  two. This is not even hard. I fight two things at once. That's it. Um, like, okay. That's not hard.
[1405.85s -> 1419.86s]  I only like hard games. No, I'm sorry. I don't like this. I only like hard games. Let's save toad.
[1421.91s -> 1434.63s]  Okay. So this is me too. I only like hard games too. Now the game actually does get,
[1435.51s -> 1443.48s]  the game does get a little challenging just in regards to some facets of the game,
[1443.48s -> 1449.74s]  facets of the game. How do you say that? Boy, that was a close call. Here's a token of my appreciation.
[1450.70s -> 1455.42s]  Flower tap. So if you wanna know what a flower tap does, this is the interesting part.
[1456.38s -> 1465.16s]  Flower is mana. So when you have, you can get flower tabs, flower boxes, flower jars,
[1465.72s -> 1475.42s]  and they increase your maximum mana by one. Neat, huh? That's pretty cool. Syrup is a mana potion.
[1475.42s -> 1485.82s]  Think of mushrooms as health potions. Check for secrets, you know? There could be secrets
[1485.82s -> 1493.90s]  anywhere. The one thing that I never ever actually did in this game, and never really explored,
[1493.90s -> 1500.79s]  even though I've played this game a thousand times, is the frog coins. I never did anything
[1500.79s -> 1506.31s]  with them, and I never cared to. All right, there is a toad that's been beaten up. Oops.
[1507.35s -> 1515.90s]  They're mostly useless. Oh shit, I shouldn't have read that. I just took a lot of damage.
[1516.78s -> 1521.34s]  Yeah, that's my understanding from that as well, because frog coins are just very novelty things,
[1522.14s -> 1523.50s]  weird accessories that you can get.
[1523.50s -> 1542.34s]  There is a permanently missable frog coin where you have to jump off a toad's head who starts
[1542.34s -> 1559.40s]  walking during a cutscene. Really? See, that's the kind of shit I love. That's coming up really soon,
[1559.40s -> 1568.76s]  actually. Is it? Uh oh, I'm gonna miss it. I'm gonna get healed too. Three hour stream of
[1568.76s -> 1577.30s]  Germa fighting Kulex. No, actually. I will beat Kulex first try. I hate to say it, I'm sorry to
[1577.30s -> 1589.34s]  say it, but now when I fight Kulex is another story, you know. Where's Toad? I know you're over
[1589.34s -> 1602.60s]  here somewhere. Where's Toad? Isn't he hidden over here? Oh, there he is. All right. Oh, that's scary.
[1603.48s -> 1615.27s]  Uh oh. Really gotta pad out this playthrough. This is the first mini boss in the game. All right,
[1615.27s -> 1624.30s]  gotta get a good voice. Hey, are you looking at me? My hammer and I don't like you. Mario,
[1624.30s -> 1636.26s]  you better be careful. He's definitely got a mean streak. Now you got my hammer angry. You
[1636.26s -> 1644.55s]  shouldn't have done that. And there's two. The Hammer Brothers. So we're gonna do something fun.
[1644.55s -> 1662.95s]  We're gonna... 33 damage. We're gonna use it over and over again just to get rid of this one gone.
[1662.95s -> 1670.01s]  See you later. I do have to be careful because Valor up now means that they're... they take more
[1670.01s -> 1683.24s]  damage and they dish it out too. All right, six. I can do this two more times. See? Kulex first
[1683.24s -> 1690.68s]  try live. Uh oh, this is actually important. I didn't get it. Oh fuck, I'm gonna die.
[1697.98s -> 1704.47s]  Die. I'm gonna die in my like 11th playthrough. Uh oh. I can just do it with my hand.
[1711.62s -> 1719.30s]  I don't want to use the honey syrup. Okay, I gotta get this right. Now, there it is. Okay, so I'm block...
[1719.30s -> 1726.18s]  when you block shit, you... you might not get it right. They're weirdly timed. That whole animation
[1726.18s -> 1741.82s]  has to go by first before you block. Uh, I think... yeah, I'm gonna do it again. I really want to just
[1741.82s -> 1745.34s]  jump on him, but is it really worth me taking a honey syrup? He's probably... he's got like five
[1745.34s -> 1762.49s]  health left. How did you know? I just do. Why is it that whenever I play bad games, you're here,
[1762.49s -> 1770.95s]  but whenever I play good games, you're not here? Well, which one is this? I don't... I don't know
[1770.95s -> 1785.62s]  which one is this. Got a flower jar though, and we leveled up. Max HP 25, 23, 2.
[1786.50s -> 1794.46s]  It's magic attacking, magic defense. Level this up correctly or I'm gonna unfollow. See, when I was
[1794.46s -> 1803.66s]  younger, I did a thing and I kind of just continue to do it. Uh, I pick one option
[1804.54s -> 1811.98s]  and I do it every single time with each playable character. So I would just have, like for instance,
[1811.98s -> 1820.79s]  Mario would have hundreds of HP. And I don't... I never really changed that up.
[1825.62s -> 1829.54s]  Because there's three people in your party, so I figured, all right, one of them is going to be
[1829.54s -> 1841.46s]  good at everything. Uh, I want health. I do. Actually, maybe... hmmm... I gotta plan... I gotta
[1841.46s -> 1849.38s]  think about this. I'm gonna do health. Power. Power. No, I'm gonna do health. Caring about HP.
[1849.38s -> 1856.82s]  Yeah, you have to care about HP in this game. Otherwise, people die. You'll die. Let us pick.
[1857.38s -> 1866.70s]  I'm not... I gotta let you guys ruin my childhood again. Fine. I'll let you guys ruin my childhood
[1866.70s -> 1875.11s]  again. You guys are really onto this recently, ruining my childhood every day. I mean, I mean,
[1875.11s -> 1878.39s]  every day. I don't mean every... I mean like just today. I don't know why I said every day.
[1879.35s -> 1886.50s]  Okay. Uh, sure. Why not? Here we go. You guys can pick. Don't fuck this up, though, because like
[1886.50s -> 1897.05s]  you literally will ruin this whole game. What do you want me to do? Like really don't fuck this up.
[1897.05s -> 1919.99s]  Okay. All right, we're doing power. Uh, thank you for choosing the thing I'm gonna pick for Mario
[1919.99s -> 1931.78s]  every time. By the way, forgot to mention that's what this was. Why can I get this off the screen?
[1936.54s -> 1941.34s]  Get off the screen. Why can I not take... There we go. All right. Power. Attack went up from
[1941.34s -> 1947.66s]  33 to 24. Defense 2 to 3. Now this is physical attack power. So if somebody casts a magic spell,
[1947.66s -> 1951.26s]  this is not gonna do shit. I hope you guys understand what you've just done.
[1952.06s -> 1960.18s]  All right. Thanks, Mario. I was running so fast. I wasn't watching where I was going.
[1961.35s -> 1967.58s]  Whoa. Mushroom Kingdom's just ahead. We're almost there, Mario. Hey, where did this hammer come from?
[1969.35s -> 1979.34s]  Hmm. Hey, do you know what this is? It's the hammer, brothers. It's significant. No one stands a
[1979.34s -> 1987.27s]  chance against you when you whop them with this. You never know. It might come in handy.
[1989.50s -> 1994.94s]  Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. Let's get a move on. I'll see you in Mushroom Kingdom.
[1999.32s -> 2005.99s]  You can probably guess that, uh, that is a weapon. Attack power goes to 34.
[2010.26s -> 2028.92s]  Now the game begins. Mushroom Kingdom. I thought this was for crafting? No. Here's the Mushroom
[2028.92s -> 2045.08s]  Kingdom. Hey, Mario. Look what you're standing in. Gotcha. It made me jump. Just a fan. The star
[2045.08s -> 2050.58s]  means it's an in and a save point. And the mushroom means it's a shop and potentially...
[2052.02s -> 2060.30s]  Yeah, gotcha. Good. Items and weapons and all that good stuff. Mario, what a pleasant surprise.
[2060.86s -> 2067.11s]  One of Frog Fuchs' grandchildren is running errands in town today. I haven't seen him, though. Oh,
[2067.11s -> 2076.14s]  you're here to shop. What are you looking for? Here we go. See, shirt, pants, shoes. Uh, jump
[2076.14s -> 2080.54s]  shoe. It'll use jump attacks against any foe. This is really good. Antidote pin prevents poison.
[2081.50s -> 2092.62s]  But I need... you gotta get... you gotta get armor first. Get pants. Mario's not wearing pants. Uh,
[2092.62s -> 2101.32s]  shirt and pants. And I also did this when I played this game all the time. I am gonna get
[2101.32s -> 2107.90s]  a lot of shit for this. I already know it. There's gonna be a lot of RPG min-maxers that are gonna be
[2107.90s -> 2115.70s]  what the fuck is wrong with this guy. Um, I max out my inventory with revives. Every time. I have,
[2115.70s -> 2123.88s]  like, 20 pick me ups. Because I'm terrible at video games. So I just have a ton of
[2123.88s -> 2130.22s]  heals and pick me ups. And I'm probably gonna get made fun of. But I'm already accepting that.
[2132.78s -> 2140.87s]  It's not optimal at all. I know. But for right now, this is fine. I don't have enough for the
[2140.87s -> 2148.50s]  jump shoes. Let's equip. Uh, somebody just gave a lot of money. Defense and magic defense. And
[2148.50s -> 2156.23s]  pants. They're not for me. They're for somebody else. Uh, phylactery. Let's just give 100 bucks.
[2156.87s -> 2170.71s]  Thank you. For the 100 dollars and 11 cents. They say,
[2170.71s -> 2174.71s]  I will give you 500 dollars to play Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door on stream.
[2176.71s -> 2182.31s]  Well, uh, I'm sa- I'm sorry to say I will never get that money. I'm never gonna receive that money.
[2182.31s -> 2187.00s]  And I'm not gonna do that. I appreciate it, though. Thank you so much for the 100 bucks.
[2188.04s -> 2198.50s]  Oh, this is tha- oh yeah, this is the person that's playing on the Game Boy. Wait, this is important
[2198.58s -> 2204.86s]  stuff. But no, phylactery, let's say that, like, you're up, you have to be up to over five, six,
[2204.86s -> 2214.28s]  seven, eight hundred dollars. No, thank you. Here we go, ready? Don't talk to me now! Nothing up
[2214.28s -> 2225.29s]  there? He's only the last level of the game or something. And all the inns, people are just
[2225.29s -> 2233.59s]  sleeping. It's not like I'm always sleeping. Yes, it is. You're always sleeping up here.
[2233.59s -> 2239.51s]  Don't talk to him, he's gaming. Paper Mario is better than this. Well, that's the thing about
[2239.59s -> 2247.26s]  video game opinions. I get to have one and so do you. I happen to think this is the best game
[2247.26s -> 2253.10s]  that Nintendo's probably ever made. And if you like it, then that's- if you like the other one
[2253.10s -> 2266.60s]  better, I'm glad you do. But you're wrong. It's so nice to see our young ones having a good time,
[2266.60s -> 2276.73s]  but you're not that old. I always look for boxes. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Oh, look, here's like the-
[2276.73s -> 2278.89s]  the- look, the wicked, like, caffeine person.
[2298.25s -> 2304.14s]  All right, let's go. Hey, did you see a crocodile around here? He talks like a
[2304.14s -> 2308.94s]  mobster wannabe. I'm sure he's up to no good. Hey, wait a second, my wallet's gone.
[2311.29s -> 2316.38s]  Now, shit, I'm sorry about your wallet. All right, let's continue. I think there's-
[2317.26s -> 2323.54s]  anything else to see in here? Oh, yeah, that's right. This kid.
[2348.15s -> 2353.37s]  I love that. There's the sprite going up and down.
[2354.25s -> 2364.22s]  Look, I'll help you. In fact, you might be better than me, kid. Keep at it.
[2373.27s -> 2378.97s]  All right, let's go talk to the chancellor. Do all toads, like, talk- like, toad? Or is
[2378.97s -> 2395.26s]  there some toads that talk like this? Wait, no! Is this the part? Is this the part you're talking
[2395.26s -> 2399.02s]  about? This is the part you're talking about? This is the part you're talking about. Fuck, I- I ruined
[2400.06s -> 2408.30s]  that. That's the part you're talking about, isn't it? I missed the coin. In all my years,
[2408.30s -> 2412.62s]  I've never done that. I missed it. It's over. I might as well just delete this game and- and
[2412.62s -> 2426.76s]  stop streaming. But what about this toad? This is a toad, right? That- that- this is a toad.
[2427.40s -> 2437.13s]  So would he also talk like this? Or does he have a lower voice?
[2449.32s -> 2455.51s]  Oh, excuse me. Where- where is the princess? She departed for your house hours ago.
[2456.15s -> 2479.61s]  I feel the worst. Could Bowser somehow be behind all of this? Spore's alive. You're telling us that
[2479.61s -> 2486.52s]  Bowser has abducted the princess again. Never mind. It will be up to you to enter the keep
[2486.52s -> 2497.70s]  and rescue Princess Toadstool. No, you're not getting this. Yeah, guys, this is back before
[2497.78s -> 2510.44s]  Mario talked. This is my favorite part. Not yet.
[2540.70s -> 2541.26s]  Got a map.
[2552.42s -> 2555.86s]  Go to the cellar and prepare for your journey. The vault guard shall assist you.
[2556.50s -> 2569.53s]  Where is it? Come on, it's over here somewhere. So this is up- I believe this is going to- this
[2569.53s -> 2577.78s]  is the princess's room? Yeah. The princess hasn't returned yet. Can you imagine how the chancellor
[2577.78s -> 2601.94s]  must feel? I'm just checking for stuff. Found Toadstool's- Hey, what are you doing? I'll give
[2601.94s -> 2631.06s]  you this in exchange. Just leave everything where it was. What? Okay. Mario, the chancellor has filled
[2631.06s -> 2636.98s]  me in. Come, let me show you around. This is gonna get fucking tiring. Help yourself to the
[2636.98s -> 2644.82s]  treasures. This mushroom will restore your hit points and flower points. Unfortunately,
[2644.82s -> 2654.71s]  mushrooms you find as items only restore your HP. So beware. This is a flower. The more gathering
[2654.71s -> 2663.11s]  you do, the more flower points you'll have in battle. Find them. This is a coin. The small
[2663.11s -> 2671.30s]  ones are worth one and the large ones are worth 10. This one's a 10. Do you know about flower
[2671.30s -> 2679.34s]  points? Yes. You sure are smart, Mario. All right, now walk that way so I can get the secret.
[2688.66s -> 2718.09s]  All right, let's go. Hmm, I gotta think of- I gotta think of one. I'm back here. Oh, get back here.
[2723.85s -> 2738.42s]  Oh no, that reptile stole my grandfather's coin. I can't cry. Big boys don't cry,
[2738.42s -> 2762.42s]  but it's just not fair. I gotta do. Good luck, kid. Yes, gee, you're soaking wet, aren't you?
[2765.05s -> 2771.69s]  I'm all right now, sorry. There's nothing like a good cry. But why was I crying? There was some
[2771.69s -> 2778.73s]  reason. My grandpa asked me to buy some things for him here. When I walked into town that croc
[2778.73s -> 2784.63s]  stopped me. Oh yeah, he took it from me. He stole my coin. I chased him, but he was too fast.
[2785.19s -> 2793.10s]  Hey Mario, let's see how you're going to take on Bowser. Wow, he doesn't stand a chance.
[2795.42s -> 2800.78s]  Wait, you're the Mario? I know all about you. You've got more jump in you than a box of frogs.
[2801.66s -> 2807.34s]  I'm Mallow from Tadpole Pond. I'm a frog, but can you believe it? I can't jump. It's embarrassing.
[2808.06s -> 2810.46s]  How about it, Mario? Will you help me catch that filthy thief?
[2812.41s -> 2820.41s]  Yeah. The young frog Mallow, who doesn't look at all like a frog, joins Mario in his quest.
[2826.50s -> 2840.71s]  New party member. And I planned ahead. Put on those pants, Mallow. What do I have for items?
[2843.61s -> 2853.90s]  I do a flower jar. Let's use it. I need a couple of mushrooms, I think. First, let's save it.
[2865.62s -> 2876.23s]  Wasted the flower jar? I did not. All right, let's do uh... Hey, Mallow, what kept you? I was starting
[2876.23s -> 2883.69s]  to worry. Wait until you hear this. You see... Wait, I've already heard. Old Frog Fuchs has told me.
[2883.69s -> 2889.61s]  He seems to know everything. Hold on. No, listen to me. The truth of the matter is, well, um,
[2890.49s -> 2896.57s]  the coin was stolen. What? Well, if that's the case, I guess we can't trade. That's a shame.
[2898.26s -> 2904.18s]  Oh, but there's no need to worry. Mario here is going to help us. Is that so? Well, if Mario's
[2904.18s -> 2910.49s]  on your team, you'll have that coin back in a jiffy. Not so fast. Take this with you. You'll
[2910.49s -> 2921.24s]  probably need it. Pick me up. Uh, but I need to buy a couple more. I love this job. What are you
[2921.24s -> 2931.59s]  looking for? I'm looking for like a couple of these. Want to do these? One more of these.
[2933.08s -> 2947.80s]  Inefficient, but it's one more of those. Okay. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Get off
[2947.80s -> 2968.97s]  there this minute. I order you to stand before me. I now order you to jump. In this world,
[2968.97s -> 2974.30s]  there are things called hidden treasures. Use your awesome jumping ability to look for them.
[2974.30s -> 2992.09s]  And he's got one sitting right here somewhere, don't he? Okay, bye. All right. So we have to
[2992.09s -> 2999.53s]  try to... We have to go to Toad. Mario, I have something to report, sir. I saw him. He's here
[2999.53s -> 3005.35s]  somewhere. He just zoomed past me a second ago. Did you see him? Did he look something like this?
[3008.20s -> 3015.21s]  Why, yes, exactly. He's the one who took my coin. Why didn't you stop him? Because I forgot my
[3015.21s -> 3025.98s]  bazooka at home. Sheesh, give me a break here. Get back here. You smugs will never catch me.
[3025.98s -> 3044.94s]  A snail can outrun you morons. Later. That's him. Hurry, Mario. Let's get him. Got anything for me?
[3044.94s -> 3059.66s]  No. You're too slow. You're too slow. Bandits way. Let's go. Hmm. There he is. He probably
[3059.66s -> 3064.92s]  stashed it in that bag. Let's nab him. Are you trying to tell me? Go on, hold on before you get
[3064.92s -> 3095.70s]  hurt, kid. He does a very high speed. He can one hit. One hit. Thunderbolt now. Use Mallow's
[3095.70s -> 3115.98s]  stretchy arms. I love the hammer sound. It sounds so great. You missed me. Now this is a frog.
[3118.04s -> 3132.81s]  I mean, it's like a human frog. This game has battles and not just wacky dialogue.
[3133.61s -> 3137.37s]  Um, no. There's lots of wacky dialogue and there are lots of battles.
[3138.49s -> 3156.90s]  Oh, I forgot. This game doesn't just have wacky dialogue. I'm just checking. You couldn't jump to
[3156.90s -> 3173.61s]  save your life, kid. So I guess this is goodbye. And he stole one of the coins. Oh, fuck. All right,
[3173.61s -> 3182.20s]  here we go. Is this when I... Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Where do you... Sometimes you get stars.
[3184.28s -> 3192.65s]  I know there's something around here, isn't there? What about over here? Oh, there has to be.
[3193.61s -> 3200.68s]  Right? If you find a star in this game, you're guaranteed to level up like at least once or
[3200.68s -> 3214.86s]  twice, at least. That is... Okay, it is the next room. You're right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3214.86s -> 3235.45s]  Oh, you're a persistent bugger, but I'm a hundred miles ahead of you. He is pretty fast. Any chests
[3235.45s -> 3254.97s]  or anything? He is fast. I feel like you lied when you played this game five hundred times.
[3257.26s -> 3263.50s]  No, I played it like once every three or four years. No, sorry. I don't go to sleep at night
[3263.50s -> 3304.04s]  saying all of Krakos' lines out loud. Why don't you? Wait. Stupid. There he goes. It's not worth it.
[3306.49s -> 3310.09s]  It's not even a thing you should be looking... Give up already. That treasure box is tempting,
[3310.09s -> 3315.56s]  but now is not the time. Oh, it is absolutely worth it. It's definitely worth it because we're
[3315.56s -> 3323.88s]  going to level up like three times. This all counts as a full battle, by the way.
[3323.88s -> 3339.93s]  There it is. Bingo. Mallow has reached level three. His HP has gone up by four. His defense
[3339.93s -> 3351.77s]  is terrible. His magic attack is... Mallow, I believe, has the best magic in the game.
[3351.77s -> 3359.86s]  I think Peach has... Oh, spoilers. Fuck. HP rain. All right. What do you guys think? Where should I go?
[3359.86s -> 3390.49s]  All right. Special. Magic attack. Magic defense. I can't click down there. All right. We're doing
[3390.49s -> 3400.30s]  magic. Thank you for voting. So this brings us to 18 attack, 13. One point at each one.
[3402.47s -> 3406.71s]  That's probably what I would have done too. Although, make sure you guys give Mallow some
[3406.71s -> 3418.04s]  HP because he is very, very, very weak. Very weak. Like, super replaceable weak. I mean, no.
[3418.68s -> 3428.44s]  You guys do not want me to use him. Okay. That's why you bring all the pick me ups.
[3429.32s -> 3432.54s]  I got another flower tab. All right. I think there's something else I can do over here.
[3435.16s -> 3445.58s]  Winter Squash. Just gave $50. Thank you, Winter Squash. 5,000 bits. And they say,
[3446.62s -> 3452.38s]  Jeremy, the other day I spilled pasta sauce on my keyboard and I ruined it. At first I was annoyed,
[3452.38s -> 3458.62s]  but then I remembered the time you spilled PBR all over your keyboard live on stream and I
[3458.62s -> 3464.95s]  immediately felt better about myself. Keep up the good work, streamer. I don't drink PBR. I've never
[3465.03s -> 3469.27s]  spilled PBR anywhere. That would imply that I had to have purchased it.
[3481.94s -> 3491.53s]  Yes, that was not a PBR though. I think there's no, I'm good. Let's go. Dead end. And they won't
[3491.53s -> 3498.63s]  give up. I'll just have to hide. This is where he starts adding mileage every time you go and find
[3498.63s -> 3506.68s]  him. He's gone into hiding. Let's see if we can sneak up behind him and catch him. Full health.
[3506.76s -> 3512.06s]  And hey, what's up? What's this you fools couldn't chase down a pumpkin?
[3520.55s -> 3526.87s]  Found you. Your eyes are much faster than your feet. At this rate it'll take you a hundred more
[3526.87s -> 3536.70s]  years to catch me. Your eyes are faster than your feet. At this rate it'll take you 50 more
[3536.70s -> 3550.02s]  years to catch me. This is getting old. It'll still take you enough. You got me fair and square.
[3550.74s -> 3556.66s]  I'll give you back your coin. Did you really believe me? I was lying.
[3559.85s -> 3590.70s]  Boss time. Eight. Oh, he hurts. By the way, there are timed hits also on special attacks. Oh, fuck.
[3592.14s -> 3603.30s]  Oh, I missed that one. I don't tell you, Mallow, Mallow is weak. Very weak. I might even have to
[3603.30s -> 3610.81s]  take a mushroom. Oh my god, that picked me up. Oh boy. He's good. All right, now I actually have
[3610.81s -> 3624.55s]  to heal him. No, Mario does the damage. Heal yourself. Got a freebie. That means at the end
[3624.55s -> 3629.03s]  of the game, or end of the round here, we get something cool. I'm gonna, Mario's gonna heal now.
[3630.47s -> 3633.43s]  Uh, if I go for damage, I'm just gonna go straight up and jump on him.
[3634.31s -> 3648.82s]  And then Mallow's gonna heal him. He means he didn't use the item. I was just testing him.
[3648.82s -> 3658.14s]  He's almost dead. Shit. Yeah, Mallow, Mallow is kind of just straight up support. All right,
[3658.14s -> 3669.88s]  I'm gonna have to use the honey. This is a real game for real gamers? I mean, yeah, it is. Did I
[3669.88s -> 3681.45s]  get it? Fuck. I didn't get it again. Shit. I think you have to wait another second after the bomb
[3681.45s -> 3693.78s]  blows up. All right, I'm out of uh, mana. I think he's close. All right, let's go with honey syrup.
[3699.24s -> 3711.14s]  Do a raptor noise? No, I'm not gonna do a raptor. When do I get psychopath? Psychopath is incredibly
[3711.14s -> 3730.25s]  helpful. Do it. Do it. Do it. All right, weird mushroom. You think it's healed? You know, fuck it.
[3730.25s -> 3739.42s]  I'll show you this. I'll show you this. This is cool. See if I can get it. Got it. When you hit that
[3739.42s -> 3754.38s]  second strike, that's the time tip. I think you can do this too. Let's see. When it flies over.
[3757.61s -> 3763.54s]  Yeah, there it is. It's right at the very end when the cloud starts to close. Fuck. Seriously?
[3764.10s -> 3784.20s]  God damn it. Yeah, that was a oof moment. You're right. Take the honey syrup. Finally. All right.
[3789.11s -> 3805.43s]  Still going. Why do you have so much health? Get out of here. How much health do you have?
[3806.15s -> 3829.86s]  I only, okay, I only have two anyways. There it is.
[3846.14s -> 3859.86s]  Yes, amigos. All right. We got it back. ADXP. 10 coins. Flower tab. And a Mario level up.
[3860.58s -> 3868.49s]  25 to 30. That's a big jump for attack and defense. That's a milestone of a level.
[3869.64s -> 3889.35s]  And I learned fire orb. Yes, I did. Don't mess it up. Malo has more defense than Mario.
[3897.45s -> 3907.16s]  Little dancing flowers. All right, we'll go with power. Sounds good to me. That is what I,
[3907.16s -> 3917.90s]  I would have picked power as well. We did it. We got grandpa's coin back. I can finish my errand
[3917.90s -> 3925.45s]  now. Hey, look at this. That croco guy left a wallet. I'm going back to the shop at Mushroom
[3925.45s -> 3938.10s]  Kingdom. Are you coming? There's the fast travel shortcut out. Got a wallet too. Okay. So that is
[3938.10s -> 3958.23s]  that part. And got a wallet. Let's actually, let's, yeah, I'm all right with this. Let's test this out.
[3959.19s -> 3980.66s]  42. That's pretty good. Time to grind. No, there actually is a spot in the, close to the end game
[3981.62s -> 3986.74s]  that is an insane grinding spot. You kill this same little blue thing and it has the most
[3986.74s -> 3996.73s]  experience pound for pound. It takes one hit for the thing to die. It's pretty much cheating. All
[3996.73s -> 4023.51s]  right. Back to Mushroom Kingdom where there's something wrong here. Something going on. It
[4023.59s -> 4031.03s]  looks normal to me. Shit. All right. The fireballs always got me. They always did. I never block
[4031.03s -> 4037.67s]  fireballs. It's after, or is it before or is it like second after? I forget. The fireballs get me
[4037.67s -> 4048.39s]  every time. Use Thunderbolt? Not yet. Thunderbolt is, yes, it is incredible against these enemies,
[4048.39s -> 4059.93s]  but not unless there's more than two. It's a waste of flower power. My opinion. The magic can't be
[4060.01s -> 4066.15s]  blocked. I always thought some of it could though. Like you can block the slimes that come out of
[4066.15s -> 4071.11s]  people. The little like globs that like, yeah, you have to, the stars don't come out of you.
[4071.11s -> 4077.56s]  Then yeah, that's true. Thanks Mario. I'll continue to stand watch, but now everyone seems suspicious.
[4078.28s -> 4091.29s]  By the way, look what I got. 10 coins. Please leave the correct amount of money for items.
[4091.29s -> 4101.45s]  Manager. All right. I need, I need, how many of these do I have? 10 coins for one of, how many?
[4101.45s -> 4114.10s]  Two? I already got pants. How many do I have? Four? I need like at least five or six of these.
[4116.87s -> 4123.00s]  I'm gonna probably, I'm gonna get like seven, eight. Let's get another two. I'm gonna need them
[4123.00s -> 4137.29s]  and then another one of these. Two more of these. Okay. How am I doing? Looks like a pretty standard,
[4138.17s -> 4145.61s]  um, pretty standard inventory. I got the, what? So worth $123. Yeah, that's true. Okay. Sell the
[4145.61s -> 4152.81s]  wallet. How is this selling a wallet? Aren't I just taking the cash out and handing it to the person?
[4157.96s -> 4161.72s]  Yeah, I got bad news for those of you that want me to return this wallet.
[4168.28s -> 4175.29s]  Turns out it ain't worth it. That's, I could get everything. Okay, fine. I'll be a good person.
[4176.76s -> 4180.52s]  We got, uh, Malice doesn't have a weapon. I don't think Mal gets a weapon for a while.
[4185.62s -> 4192.42s]  Excuse me? You want to, what? How can you shop at a time like this? Just take what you want and leave
[4192.42s -> 4221.88s]  some money. I wish you luck. All right, let's go save everybody. Level up a little. He's too scared
[4221.88s -> 4246.94s]  to stop you from jumping on his furniture. Now, do it. Two damage. I thought it was 20. Ow. Jump
[4246.94s -> 4251.02s]  on the furniture. No, I'm not going to, why would I do that? You guys, okay. Return the wallet is
[4251.02s -> 4255.82s]  something that is, all right, come on, you can do more than two fucking damage. Return the wallet is
[4255.82s -> 4261.10s]  a big deal to you guys, but jump on the scared guy's fucking nice furniture in his house is okay.
[4263.62s -> 4269.32s]  You understand how I'm having trouble with this with you guys? That was too darn close. Thanks for
[4269.32s -> 4274.52s]  the land, Mario. Hey, that's the wallet that the crocodile swiped for me. Can I have that wallet
[4274.52s -> 4301.14s]  back? No way. Thank you so much. Here, I'll give you this as a reward. Go on, take it at 123 points.
[4302.26s -> 4314.57s]  But I had to do the right thing. Everyone's safe in here. It's testing. So nice to see our young
[4314.57s -> 4322.47s]  ones having a good time. It's scary outside, so let's play indoors, okay? But I want to play
[4322.47s -> 4351.59s]  outside. It's too dangerous. Yeah, she's like, oh wow. Look, I can go higher. Here, go fish.
[4352.63s -> 4365.06s]  Yeah, she thinks it's cool because they're jumping. She's a huge fan of jumping.
[4366.42s -> 4388.86s]  When is a German jumping stream going to happen? You saw it yesterday.
[4389.66s -> 4398.84s]  Oh, the Kinect streams are German jumping streams. Hey Mario, look what you're standing in.
[4400.44s -> 4419.38s]  Gotcha. Still running the business. Still playing your game. Was the princess kidnapped by those
[4419.38s -> 4435.90s]  things outside? Are they a part of this? Oh, shut up. See, I'm wide awake. Now I guess it's time for
[4435.90s -> 4462.74s]  me to win big cash. There's a casino in this game. Bet you didn't know that. Yeah, he's just bouncing
[4462.74s -> 4471.37s]  on the door. Stop that. Trying to get at least one more level up for Mario. It's pretty important
[4472.09s -> 4486.06s]  because Malo is almost 100% useless right here. In a moment, Malo will be very, very useful.
[4491.70s -> 4497.45s]  Say that to his face. I'm standing behind them, but I'm talking pretty loudly. They can both hear me.
[4505.45s -> 4512.98s]  In fact, they turn around and look at me all the time to ask me what they should be doing.
[4517.83s -> 4522.15s]  Yeah, she's right. I guess we can put it off until things cool down around here.
[4522.71s -> 4526.30s]  I found the perfect place for a wedding, but now we're all stuck inside.
[4526.94s -> 4538.60s]  Everybody's stuck. Now we can leave. Town is being attacked.
[4542.94s -> 4547.34s]  There are things in our kitchen. Help. Look, scary things. Get rid of them.
[4550.84s -> 4578.95s]  Hope my little brother's okay. I'll handle this. It's too scary. There's two scary people here.
[4578.95s -> 4596.01s]  There's two in this room and I feel a level up coming soon. Probably Malo.
[4599.29s -> 4610.36s]  No, I was wrong. Am I gonna beat this whole game on stream? Um, I don't, I don't know.
[4611.85s -> 4619.48s]  Probably. Maybe not all today. It depends. I don't think I'll be able to do it in one sitting.
[4620.92s -> 4632.14s]  This game is like a, this is like a 18-hour game. This game takes about 20 hours to go through.
[4632.78s -> 4649.64s]  So I don't think that'll be a one and done stream. Malo. Nope. Thanks Mario.
[4650.28s -> 4663.86s]  But what about my son upstairs? Oops. I forgot all about him. I'm scared.
[4670.17s -> 4690.65s]  Boing, boing, boing. Now this guy can jump. Now Malo's gonna die. You're killing his friend.
[4696.79s -> 4713.58s]  What are you, why are you doing this? You're bashing his friend's head. Stop this. They were
[4713.58s -> 4721.24s]  just playing Mario together. Oh no, this is dangerous. They're monsters. They're trying
[4721.24s -> 4729.59s]  to get, they're trying to kill us. Really? Thank you so much for everything. Here's a little token
[4729.59s -> 4736.87s]  of my appreciation. Got a flower tab. You're gonna grow up to be just like Mario. You hear?
[4739.64s -> 4754.41s]  Am I? Yes. I can still jump the highest. I love this little kid. I love this little kid.
[4757.34s -> 4764.95s]  Oh, that's, I love that little kid. He's so cute. Okay, let's go. Faster. Go faster.
[4765.83s -> 4769.59s]  No, the poor kid's gonna throw up if you keep telling him to go faster.
[4773.22s -> 4778.84s]  All right, what do I get for health? It's not, not very good. Let's change that.
[4782.23s -> 4792.07s]  What do I have for, uh, flower points? 18. How many tabs do I have? I got a lot of tabs. I mean,
[4792.31s -> 4806.95s]  technically, I'm not supposed to use these, but I'm gonna need them. When I say technically,
[4806.95s -> 4814.18s]  you're not supposed to use them. If you use a flower tab, it fills up your flower mana
[4815.06s -> 4821.86s]  all the way. But you can only do it from the menu. So that's why it's not what you're thinking.
[4822.74s -> 4829.82s]  The flower tabs increase your max mana. Yeah. And they fill up your mana as well.
[4830.46s -> 4852.01s]  Here we go. Yes, there it is. All right, Malo is level four. A nice jump on the HP.
[4853.58s -> 4875.14s]  28 HP. Yes, you decide. You do. Mario is hard carrying. Yeah, that's kind of how it is
[4875.14s -> 4880.30s]  for the first hour or two of the game. Sometimes even more. For the first like two or three hours
[4880.30s -> 4893.27s]  of the game, Mario is just hard carrying. All right, that's it. We're doing a magic attack and
[4893.27s -> 4906.95s]  magic defense. Again, I wonder if we get Mario too. Now that was really scary. Everyone's hiding in
[4906.95s -> 4911.35s]  the princess's bedroom. I and some others couldn't escape in time. I hope no one got hurt.
[4916.49s -> 4932.60s]  Uh oh. Toad's lagging out. Come on. Come on, cocks. God damn it. 700 ping Toad.
[4938.01s -> 4951.21s]  He's getting the G mod disconnect message. I don't even know what that is. Ooh, that magic
[4951.21s -> 4970.58s]  defense is really helping though. Three damage. Mario's taking 10. Oops. Malo better than Mario.
[4970.58s -> 4977.50s]  Maybe eventually, but not right now. Use thunder? No, not until it's necessary,
[4978.14s -> 4986.30s]  because I'm going to waste all of my flower points before I really need them. And I'm gonna
[4986.30s -> 4995.45s]  really need them really soon. Saved by Mario again. How could I ever thank you? I love that.
[4995.45s -> 4998.57s]  He goes like this and puts his back against the wall and slowly goes upstairs.
[4999.53s -> 5013.93s]  Trapped again. Not so fast, pal. Look at him. Can't even bounce. Hey, maybe we could bounce on his
[5013.93s -> 5029.35s]  head. I mean, I don't need a device to bounce though. I can jump higher than you and I don't
[5029.35s -> 5043.46s]  need a device to do it. So if I had a device like yours, I wonder how high I could go. And then you
[5043.46s -> 5048.90s]  walk out of the room and that person just is floored and they have to rethink everything.
[5049.78s -> 5070.78s]  Come on, Mario. Saved by Mario again. How could I ever thank you enough? Toadstool's room. You're
[5070.78s -> 5079.10s]  in one piece. Thanks to Mario, of course. Saved by Mario again. How could I ever thank you? Oh no,
[5079.10s -> 5085.58s]  the Chancellor's still in the throne room. What? That's terrible. But with Mario around, we're
[5085.58s -> 5097.61s]  safe, right? You bet. There we go. Now, hey, wait, hang on for a second. Please take this. The
[5097.61s -> 5106.73s]  Princess will be happy to know you have something of hers. I love how sometimes Mario just does like
[5106.73s -> 5113.69s]  the gym from the office. Like flower tab, right into the fucking camera. I'm like, geez, okay.
[5115.02s -> 5126.15s]  Saved everybody. I'm scared. You may not sleep in the Princess's bed. Have you no manners?
[5127.03s -> 5139.70s]  All right, I am going to. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to, I'm taking the tabs. I don't
[5139.70s -> 5148.07s]  care. I need them. What are you doing? Wait, dude, what the fuck? Idiot. What the fuck, dude? What's
[5148.07s -> 5155.05s]  wrong? Are you serious? I'm changing streams. Like I, I, I'm going to a different stream. That was
[5155.05s -> 5179.85s]  it for me. I did. I'm going to do that anyways. All right, relax. There we go. Now people are asking,
[5179.85s -> 5184.25s]  when are you going to do Thunderbolt? When there's at least three. Watch what we can do here.
[5189.94s -> 5206.20s]  Check this out. Goodbye. And that's a Mario level up right there. 35 HP, 32 attack.
[5207.38s -> 5228.07s]  Terrible defense. And I mean truly awful. Let's go. What do you think? What's the plot so far?
[5229.46s -> 5241.38s]  Bowser kidnaps Princess. Mario thwarts Bowser, saves Princess. Unfortunately,
[5241.38s -> 5247.70s]  giant sword crashes down from the sky at the very end and knocks everybody out and takes everybody
[5247.70s -> 5252.23s]  out. Therefore, what the heck's going on with this giant sword that came out of the sky?
[5253.30s -> 5259.78s]  That is not a spoiler. You just watched that part. We're at the same movie theater
[5260.34s -> 5265.78s]  and we just watched the same scene. Let's say for instance, oh no, that's who did it.
[5265.78s -> 5270.74s]  And it was, it was Gary. Whoa, just revealed on the screen and I go, holy shit, dude, it was Gary.
[5270.74s -> 5274.50s]  And you look over at me in the, in the same fucking theater and you go, what the spoilers, dude,
[5274.50s -> 5288.01s]  idiot. All right, we're going to do power. Thank you for voting. You got to get Mario some HP guys,
[5288.01s -> 5307.85s]  or some magic power. Mario needs like not, not all right. Well, no HP. There just ain't,
[5307.85s -> 5314.41s]  there ain't no point. Why would I get Mario's like arms tired for no reason?
[5315.05s -> 5325.91s]  Never hear of a glass cannon. The vault guard, I come here to save him and he runs into the next
[5325.91s -> 5349.74s]  room. Oh, so much for him. Damn. More free shit. I'll take it. You're all right. Hey, it's safe.
[5349.74s -> 5356.70s]  You're good. Nevermind that. Guess what I found. It's a gold coin, a gold coin and it's all mine.
[5358.07s -> 5369.72s]  Oh, I found this in the cellar. You can have it. Wake up pin. Yeah. Prevents mute and sleep attacks.
[5370.44s -> 5374.20s]  And it also gives you a little bit more defense. So I'm going to give this to Mario because,
[5375.24s -> 5381.40s]  I mean, look, 1822 versus 1970. Like that's much more important. Keep Mario.
[5385.93s -> 5393.27s]  Mario is in need of it. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay. No one takes our treasure. That's true.
[5393.91s -> 5402.58s]  All right, let's go. I think I'm ready. I'm going to save the game.
[5403.54s -> 5421.40s]  I need Luigi. I'm going to make everybody really, really upset about this. And I'm going to say this
[5421.40s -> 5428.90s]  and people are going to be very, very, very mad. Um, not maybe not mad, but, um, this is a spoiler.
[5428.90s -> 5437.48s]  Should I say it? Yeah. Who cares? It's not a big deal. Um, link from the legend of Zelda
[5438.62s -> 5460.18s]  is in this game more than Luigi. It's pretty, it's pretty bad. Where do you think everybody went?
[5460.90s -> 5466.82s]  Well, gang looks like we have ourselves a new home. We can bounce around all day and there's
[5466.82s -> 5481.53s]  no one here who can stand in our way. Let's bounce the night away. Hey, not so fast pal.
[5482.25s -> 5485.05s]  Look at him. Can't even bounce. Maybe we can bounce on his head.
[5495.46s -> 5502.98s]  Listen up gang. These guys are going to put a stop to our party. Are we happy about this?
[5504.49s -> 5510.33s]  You're asking for it. Ooh, you're going to get it. You picked the wrong people to bounce with,
[5510.33s -> 5527.98s]  bub. How about a fat lip to go with that ugly mustache? Here we go. Fire in the back.
[5538.42s -> 5567.02s]  Check this out. Mac is stunned. Don't worry, only four damage, not a big deal.
[5572.79s -> 5592.09s]  Nope, save it. I always tap A. Six, four, yeah, you got enough. All right, we're still fine.
[5593.05s -> 5606.55s]  64, Nintendo 64. All right, I guess I have to take care of Mario here. Oh yeah, six.
[5614.20s -> 5616.68s]  I'm going to use mushroom on Mario.
[5621.00s -> 5628.71s]  And they're back. Also, I'm going to use, how much do I, what do I have for flower points? Three.
[5629.75s -> 5634.23s]  All right, I'm going to jump. No, I'm not. I'm just going to hit him. I'm just going to whack him and
[5634.23s -> 5647.43s]  then I'm going to get on the boat again and it's gonna stun him and they can't do shit. Oops,
[5649.42s -> 5656.84s]  didn't work that time. I just got instant spawned. All right, so let me do the,
[5657.72s -> 5663.34s]  this is kind of bad actually. All right, honey syrup. We got, we both have pretty good health.
[5664.14s -> 5688.02s]  Do it again, quick. Can you stun him? Stun him would be nice. Do it again. Stun him.
[5688.82s -> 5697.43s]  This is why I wanted to save all those. You're wondering why I wasn't using the honey syrup
[5697.43s -> 5701.67s]  and why I wasn't doing thunderbolt because shit like this happens. You can, you can get destroyed.
[5702.55s -> 5727.48s]  He's done. Ain't gonna be much left after this. This motherfucker can't even attack me. Done.
[5727.48s -> 5748.74s]  That's it. See you later. Yeah, that boss is very easy. That boss is not easy at all if you don't
[5748.74s -> 5765.40s]  understand that Malo has thunderbolt. If you don't use thunderbolt. And I got a star. I beat that,
[5765.40s -> 5772.06s]  I beat that when I was four. Yes, so did I. Well, I was like probably, I was more like 12.
[5780.97s -> 5790.20s]  This is not good. This is not good. The mustachioed one is strong. Strong, yes.
[5790.20s -> 5812.68s]  Yes. We must warn the boss. Come on. Now I'm the fucking king. Gracious. Oh, it's you, Mario.
[5812.68s -> 5827.03s]  What a relief. Once again, Mario to the rescue. But who were those? Chancellor. Sir, thank goodness
[5827.03s -> 5843.21s]  you're all right. Mario, so it was you who got us through all this. We owe you a lot. First the
[5843.21s -> 5852.34s]  princess and now this. It's too much to bear. Mario, how about we ask my grandpa for help?
[5852.34s -> 5859.98s]  He knows everything. Excuse me, but who the fuck are you? Oh, hello. My name is Malo. I'm from Chad
[5859.98s -> 5867.18s]  Pol Pond. Well, any friend of Mario's is welcome here in Mushroom Kingdom. As I was saying, Mario,
[5867.18s -> 5877.06s]  you are, you are, or as I was saying, Mario, you are our only hope. Why can't I do that?
[5877.86s -> 5885.24s]  Mario, please, you must rescue the princess now. Mario, I'm in your debt too. Let's head over to
[5885.24s -> 5893.03s]  Grandpa's place in Chad Pol Pond. He can help. Wait, why did I even come to Mushroom Kingdom in
[5893.03s -> 5904.31s]  the first place? I guess I'll find out. I don't know. Could Mac, the sword-like monster who crashed
[5904.31s -> 5911.58s]  into Mushroom Kingdom, have anything to do with the star piece that Mario found? Our heroes move
[5911.58s -> 5934.58s]  on towards the Kiro sewers. Mario, all we can do is wait here. Don't let us down. Goodbye. Uh-oh,
[5934.58s -> 5953.45s]  sewer level. Resident Sleeper. Uh-oh, Resident Sleeper coming up. Uh, I think we just surpassed
[5953.45s -> 5965.64s]  Ralph. Oh, wait, wait. Oh, wait, wait, wait, hold on. This is the high score. Oh, now look,
[5965.64s -> 5984.55s]  I lost good at you. Oh, you idiot. I'm like, hey, hey, hey, hey, item shop. All right, here we go.
[5985.27s -> 5994.38s]  Hey, Malo, what kept you? I was starting to worry. Hey, mister, I got my coin back. Oh, well done,
[5994.38s -> 6000.60s]  lad. Okay, here's the thing I promised you. There, make sure it doesn't get stolen, eaten, or whatever.
[6000.60s -> 6013.61s]  Your grandpa needs it, okay? Got a cricket pie. You bet. Mario, thank you so much.
[6014.25s -> 6021.35s]  Grandpa will be delighted. You know, I hate to admit it, but I love this job. What are you looking
[6021.35s -> 6028.76s]  for? Who are you? What do you mean, Luigi's in, where's Luigi? Luigi's in this game more than he
[6028.76s -> 6044.95s]  is in Mario 64. Where is Luigi? In here? I don't know that. Luigi's not here. Why does Malo sound
[6044.95s -> 6054.25s]  like your dog? Because they're both like seven. No, there's no Luigi. I've played this game 500
[6054.25s -> 6066.02s]  times. There's no Luigi. I know that for a fact. Okay, so I got, I have plenty of items. Let's move
[6066.02s -> 6075.88s]  on. We're going to go to the sewers. He's behind the big house. Luigi's not in this game. He really
[6075.88s -> 6095.80s]  is here. Luigi, where is he then? Behind the big house. Is this Luigi? Trample the monsters. Smash
[6095.80s -> 6115.59s]  them all. It'll do you good. Trust me on this one. Is that Luigi? I don't know. That's not
[6115.59s -> 6126.20s]  Luigi. That was a half-assed phone did Luigi. Like, come on. I wasn't even trying. Kiro sewers.
[6131.26s -> 6137.18s]  This is the entrance. Grandpa says to watch out for Balo, whoever that is. It's probably a little
[6137.18s -> 6154.49s]  dark down there, so keep alert. Kiro sewers. I love this. This is the best sound. One of the best
[6154.49s -> 6174.73s]  top five sounds in the whole game. Ah, all right, let's go. Read directions on how to enter. Sure.
[6175.45s -> 6180.01s]  Stand on the pipe and push down on the control pad. If you're pressing several buttons at the same
[6180.01s -> 6195.02s]  time, you will not be able to enter. To re-enter a pipe, jump off once and try again. Thank you.
[6195.02s -> 6200.25s]  All right, so this is a little bit of a maze scenario. Although, I mean, not really. It is,
[6200.25s -> 6204.55s]  but it isn't. It is. I'm just checking it out. I wanted to check it out. Check out some stuff.
[6205.19s -> 6211.86s]  There are pipes everywhere, leading to god-who-knows-what.
[6213.66s -> 6235.29s]  And there are rats, so this now became your favorite game. Shit. Shit. It's an automatic
[6235.29s -> 6253.50s]  letter grade. Boink. He's tired now. These little mice. Yeah, they're kind of like, um, like little
[6253.50s -> 6271.94s]  mousers, right? I missed time. It's okay. What was that? What was the name of the mouse in Mario?
[6271.94s -> 6282.50s]  Mario 2. With the bombs? That was Mouser. Why am I getting question marks?
[6286.38s -> 6303.61s]  Ooh, pure water. All right, let's go. Shit just jumps out at you. This is, uh, the game that I
[6303.61s -> 6308.65s]  make a reference to every- oh fuck. Oh no, this is not good. This is very bad. I forgot about this.
[6308.65s -> 6314.73s]  All right, this thing's hard. This thing's really hard. Really hard. Um, I was going to say it's
[6314.73s -> 6318.49s]  Dark Souls reference. I was going to say it's- it's one of the things that I reference every
[6318.49s -> 6346.28s]  single fucking game. It's really high damage. Don't you dare. I didn't, so I- I did not. That
[6346.28s -> 6362.50s]  hurts. Does Thunderbolt do anything? I wonder how bad Thunderbolt is. Zero. Oh god. I'm dead.
[6367.96s -> 6380.66s]  Good thing I got these, because I'm a scrub. Oh, it hurts a lot. It don't matter. Okay,
[6380.66s -> 6390.89s]  the carny kiss. I have to block. 80. Come on. I think I'm just gonna block, because look at
[6390.89s -> 6401.51s]  how much damage this is gonna do. I'm gonna heal Mario with- no. Use the honey syrup. Pure
[6401.51s -> 6422.68s]  water's for ghosts. Okay. Uh oh. I didn't fucking block it. Shit! It's hard to block. It's a- after
[6422.68s -> 6446.95s]  the sound? All right, come on. This is it. Dead. Yes! A lot of- and flower jar and a lot of coins.
[6447.75s -> 6461.70s]  Good. And I got a true form pin. Fuck yeah. True form, uh, means you cannot be turned into a
[6461.70s -> 6466.58s]  mushroom or a scarecrow. It just essentially turns you off. I'm gonna give that to Mellow.
[6467.30s -> 6477.85s]  And I did get a jar, so what do I got? I don't have any pick-me-ups left, but I have two.
[6478.81s -> 6486.70s]  Uh, I'm not gonna use this yet. I'll use it later. But that was good. Now I have to go back and save
[6486.70s -> 6498.52s]  it. I gotta make the speedrunner jump. I got it. I actually- I did it. I can't believe it.
[6498.52s -> 6502.12s]  I actually cannot fucking believe it. That- literally speedrunners take hours doing that.
[6502.12s -> 6521.86s]  I just did it. I watched somebody sit here for four hours doing that one time.
[6521.86s -> 6538.54s]  Ah! I forget! I forget what to do! I forget where to go! That's all right. Still got what I wanted.
[6554.78s -> 6563.56s]  Guys, I'm gonna have to fill two backpacks full of pick-me-ups if you don't start picking HP.
[6564.52s -> 6578.18s]  You were gonna do that anyways.
[6594.74s -> 6615.22s]  No one gets HP. Yes, you have to have some- you have to have a tank. I want to save it. Save it.
[6616.31s -> 6626.39s]  Because I don't want to fight that stupid thing again. If you need a tank, you're not DPSing
[6626.39s -> 6639.43s]  fast enough. What are you on about? How are you supposed to DPS without- how- without being
[6639.43s -> 6660.20s]  protected first? You can't, like, attack something. That's not gonna work. Drain the water. Ah! Sorry.
[6660.20s -> 6693.98s]  Miss. Fuck off with that. Got it. Sometimes I try to trick ya. Not me. End of level. Use pure water?
[6694.62s -> 6719.96s]  Oh, lazy. I have to hit X. Mario's level five! Ooh, that's a big- that's a big increase. Help me,
[6719.96s -> 6749.96s]  please. Pick something good. Hope you do. Now this is a fight. Damn. 43, 42. I can't do this.
[6749.96s -> 6785.00s]  All right. Seems HP has taken- no? Okay. Uh, I'm gonna close this in 10 seconds. Five, four,
[6785.80s -> 6799.80s]  three, two, one, zero. I- what am I supposed to do? 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three,
[6800.60s -> 6838.41s]  two, one. HP. Thank you. The water's been drained. How is that rigged? That's not rigged. That was
[6838.89s -> 6852.97s]  an- I was in a democracy election there. The water has been drained. Ah, it's okay.
[6854.95s -> 6863.64s]  I'm glad we went through all that for three HP. Three HP could mean life or death, guys.
[6864.44s -> 6880.15s]  Jerma, are you allowing multi-click on that? Because I think I single-handedly won HP. No,
[6880.15s -> 6889.75s]  I'm not. It is only on one click. Are you openly admitting that you were spamming the click button?
[6891.85s -> 6908.39s]  Openly admitting for manipulation? What the heck, man? Uh, yeah, I want to go up there. Okay.
[6908.39s -> 6912.57s]  I want to get up there. I forget how you get up there. How do I get up there?
[6912.57s -> 6919.61s]  How do- I know there's a way to get up there. I gotta go through that one and then you jump
[6919.61s -> 6922.09s]  up there and then you jump up there. Shit. How do I get that one?
[6945.21s -> 6950.76s]  This must be Belong? Is that a fire hose or a tongue?
[6950.76s -> 6967.93s]  It's a snack attack. And you're it, mate. Let's try fire.
[6981.56s -> 7001.24s]  Room service has been kind to me. Where's me bib? Good block. Perfect block.
[7016.82s -> 7025.86s]  God, standard. The hunger. The hunger. He's dead. He's gone. That was one of the biggest things of
[7025.86s -> 7030.82s]  this game when it first came out. People- I was trying to keep a seal on that because
[7031.38s -> 7036.66s]  Malo's gone now. He picks a character and they're gone. He ate them. That was a big controversy
[7036.66s -> 7054.74s]  when it first came out. It was like, what the fuck? The character's just gone? That was scary.
[7057.67s -> 7066.02s]  Oh, that's weird. I must not have played past that part. I don't think anybody else did either.
[7066.02s -> 7071.66s]  I think when that happened, everyone just kind of assumed that was the- like the end of the
[7071.66s -> 7074.94s]  kind of- that character pissed a lot of people off. I don't think very many people played past
[7074.94s -> 7086.90s]  that. That's why I believed it, too. Ooh, stick for a body and full of straw.
[7087.70s -> 7102.76s]  Give me a scarecrow. Raw, raw, raw. Scarecrows cannot do anything but magic.
[7103.64s -> 7122.36s]  That's fine. I'm going to take a honey syrup. Sleep socks. No shit, that's not good.
[7124.57s -> 7131.70s]  It's all right. I'm just going to keep jumping on them. I'm already a scarecrow, so I don't know.
[7146.76s -> 7152.70s]  I cannot do anything now. Let's hope that Malo wakes up. Oh, I wish that it just hit him.
[7153.42s -> 7161.72s]  I can't do anything. I can just defend. That's it. Hey, look, Malo woke up. I don't have any more
[7161.72s -> 7175.59s]  honey. No, I don't. Nope. I have to punch him to death. Pure water? No, he's not a ghost.
[7176.47s -> 7191.59s]  Uh, I can't stand it. The hunger. Uh, hey, Mario's back. Should be pretty close.
[7199.93s -> 7207.46s]  That was scary. If you defeat me, you still won't beat me. Beware the flood.
[7208.42s -> 7227.45s]  Malo must have been lying when he said water would come gushing out of here.
[7231.22s -> 7238.95s]  Mario, do you hear something, or is it just me? It's water! Quick, Mario, hit the button before
[7238.95s -> 7252.02s]  it washed away. You couldn't have stood on the button. That means he's so light that he's like
[7252.74s -> 7261.58s]  a pound. This is the Midas River course. Want to crash course? No. I know you've got to float down
[7262.22s -> 7279.21s]  and swim, and there's coins to collect. There's a broad coin right here. Got it. All right,
[7279.21s -> 7291.83s]  I don't- I think I skipped this one, if I remember. Which side do I go on? Left side?
[7292.47s -> 7300.68s]  Broad coin. And I'm gonna go in. Should I- all right, should I go in this?
[7301.32s -> 7316.44s]  I don't remember. I know you go in one of them. There it is. Come on, give me it. Give me it!
[7317.00s -> 7333.98s]  Give me that flower tap right now. No! Please! Get it! It's mine! Yeah!
[7335.74s -> 7347.42s]  Yeah, now we're over here and we bounce. We should get- I can't.
[7347.42s -> 7363.99s]  I think I'm gonna go right this time. I'm gonna go in the right hole.
[7365.03s -> 7384.94s]  Give me it! Yes! Give me those coins! Spray them! There we go again. Getting spit out.
[7385.58s -> 7395.69s]  I think that's the end of that. Oh, I'm- yeah, I remember this part. That's right.
[7395.69s -> 7399.93s]  Now for the barrel jumping. Um, give me some point. I do- I remember this, but hold on. You
[7399.93s -> 7405.21s]  jump from barrel to barrel. Time your jumps and grab coins along the way. Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[7405.21s -> 7409.05s]  Jump onto the next barrel before they collide. Right, okay, let's deal with that. Now I know
[7409.05s -> 7414.18s]  exactly what's going on. You- you can stay on it. You'll- if you don't have to jump. All right,
[7414.18s -> 7419.75s]  let's go. Almost forgot to tell you, leap over the fish that pop up or you'll lose coins. All
[7419.75s -> 7437.14s]  right, let's go. All right, straight. And again, straight. Change course. Watch out for the fish.
[7440.74s -> 7457.69s]  Fuck, I missed one. No! I thought I got it! Oof! Change.
[7458.33s -> 7478.06s]  Hahaha. Stay on this one. No, I want to stay on that one! I tried. Change course. Oof, that was
[7478.06s -> 7496.94s]  close. What? How did I not get that? There it is. Wasn't that fun? You got 61 coins. Trade the coins
[7496.94s -> 7502.46s]  you got from Midas River for frog coins. As a first-time-only bonus, I'll give you one frog
[7502.46s -> 7508.22s]  coin for 60 of your coins. If you didn't know, frog coins are the green ones and tadpole ponds
[7508.22s -> 7515.50s]  got more info on them. You got 61 coins, so you get one frog coin. Yeah. I will hold your
[7515.50s -> 7521.62s]  one extra coin. Here's something I picked up. You can keep it for good luck. You got a knock-knock
[7521.62s -> 7544.52s]  shell. Knock-knock shell is Mario's next weapon. Knock-knock shell. Kick to attack. By the way,
[7544.52s -> 7570.33s]  I think you can do this over and over again. All right, I'm gonna take the first pee. I'm gonna
[7570.33s -> 7578.97s]  pee my pants. I've been drinking water. I'll be right back. Two hours and no piss. That's a first.
[7807.06s -> 7825.94s]  Hey. Sorry, I want to grab a drink too.
[7835.00s -> 7849.11s]  Jesus. Is it time for PBR? No. This is a pineapple juice. Oh, just gonna have a cold one.
[7853.82s -> 7858.38s]  That does sound really fucking weird. I'm just pouring a pineapple juice into here.
[7864.36s -> 7880.36s]  All right, he's peeing in a glass. All right, back to it. So we just got out of the sewers.
[7881.78s -> 7902.04s]  We're now going to tadpole pond to go meet grandpa. Where is this?
[7913.06s -> 7919.56s]  Hi, can I help you? Malo, it's you. We've heard all about your adventures with Super Mario.
[7921.24s -> 7931.43s]  You guys beat up Balaam, right? You know about that? See Mario, the waterways of the world bring
[7931.43s -> 7940.52s]  news to us here all the time. That's why grandpa knows all the news that's fit to hear. Are you
[7940.52s -> 7947.93s]  really the Super Mario? Hey everybody, you'll never guess who's here. No, these are not talking frying
[7947.93s -> 7956.87s]  pans. These are tadpoles. They're huge. He's the real thing. Doesn't look anything like I thought
[7956.87s -> 7972.12s]  he would. They do say he can jump better than a froggy. I wonder if it's only a rumor. I sure can.
[7975.22s -> 7986.55s]  Well, grasshopper, what's new? Grandpa, Mario's been helping me. I know, child.
[7986.55s -> 7996.92s]  That rainstorm we just had, that was you, wasn't it? Oh, watch it up there. You're supposed to make
[7996.92s -> 8015.69s]  me look like I'm floating. Welcome. So you are Mario, yes? I am Frogfusus. You've come to seek
[8015.69s -> 8022.57s]  wisdom from me, have you not? I've been waiting for you. Yes, old, wise people can often give good
[8022.57s -> 8033.34s]  advice. But how rude of me. Let's get more comfortable. Come along and we'll talk.
[8035.26s -> 8043.99s]  Clear. Full reverse. Tadpoles, don't just float there. Make yourselves useful.
[8047.24s -> 8072.23s]  Form a bridge for Mario. Everyone talking about the music. It stopped for one second.
[8072.87s -> 8082.49s]  Yes, come into my sanctuary and partake of my wisdom, children. Let's see. That smithy
[8082.49s -> 8088.98s]  character that appeared at Bowser's Keep, he is quite formidable, yes? And Mario, you wish to
[8088.98s -> 8095.62s]  rescue the princess quickly, do you not? But, oh, if all of you do the truth, Toadstool is no longer
[8095.62s -> 8111.77s]  there? Uh, what? Patience, young one. Let me explain. Here is what happened. You were rescuing
[8111.77s -> 8116.33s]  Toadstool from Bowser's Keep. After defeating him, and just when you were about to free the
[8116.33s -> 8125.27s]  princess, you heard a loud crash and saw a sword split the sky. This, whoosh, out of the blue.
[8126.15s -> 8132.28s]  The shark sent the three of you flying. Bowser and Toadstool are still lost somewhere out there.
[8133.08s -> 8139.82s]  Now, listen to me. You're worried about the princess, but first you need to take care of
[8139.90s -> 8147.32s]  Smithy. His underlings are wrecking havoc in our world. Mac, whom you defeated at Mushroom Kingdom,
[8147.32s -> 8154.70s]  was one of them. More will be coming. Grandpa, I almost forgot to tell you something. We found a
[8154.70s -> 8161.18s]  star in the castle at Mushroom Kingdom. Do you know why it was there? A star, and most interesting.
[8162.22s -> 8165.90s]  This may sound illogical, but I believe shooting stars can grant wishes.
[8166.78s -> 8170.46s]  And now, more than ever, I believe they will play a vital role in the fight against Smithy.
[8173.69s -> 8182.02s]  Was that too much to absorb? Would you like a recap? No. It's quite a situation we have
[8182.02s -> 8189.62s]  on our hands, ain't it? Wow, everything sounds so dire and serious. I guess Mac was only the
[8189.62s -> 8196.02s]  first of many, Mario. Some of them will make Bowser seem nice. Mallow, you speak as if these
[8196.02s -> 8203.22s]  things do not concern you. You will accompany Mario on his adventure, too. Grandpa, what are
[8203.22s -> 8215.51s]  you talking about? I'm only a simple tadpole. This adventure isn't for me. Mallow, my boy,
[8215.51s -> 8230.97s]  I've kept this from you until now, but you're not a tadpole. What? I was sitting here on a rainy day,
[8230.97s -> 8236.39s]  enjoying a snack of crickets when I happened to see a basket floating down from the fog.
[8237.11s -> 8244.18s]  I peeked inside and saw a little baby staring right back at me. The name Mallow was written
[8244.26s -> 8250.54s]  on his belt. I felt sorry for the little bundle of puff and took him in to raise as my own grandchild.
[8251.42s -> 8258.57s]  He had powerful magic, and I knew he was more than a piece of fluff. I thought surely this child must
[8258.57s -> 8272.84s]  be from some far off land. Grandpa, you mean I'm not a tadpole? Stop that! Mallow, now is not the
[8272.84s -> 8278.78s]  time to cry. Go with Mario on his adventure and find your real family. Your real mother and father
[8278.78s -> 8289.78s]  were out there somewhere. Hey, Mario, the boy's magic is sure to come in handy on your adventure.
[8290.58s -> 8297.86s]  You'll take him along, right? Grandpa, I won't cry anymore. I'll go on this adventure with Mario
[8297.86s -> 8303.70s]  and find my real family. Then it is settled. You must embark on your adventure immediately.
[8305.26s -> 8323.21s]  First, go to Rose Town where they need your help. It'll be quiet around here with Mallow gone.
[8324.17s -> 8330.73s]  Maybe a snack will cheer me up. Wait a minute! That's right, I'd forgotten all about it.
[8331.29s -> 8336.98s]  I'll give you something for the cricket pie you brought back. Oh, you shall have the staff I
[8336.98s -> 8343.72s]  used when I was Mallow's age. Oh, it must have to be here somewhere. The froggy stick will come in
[8343.72s -> 8355.85s]  handy. Do not forget to equip it. Froggy stick? Holy shit, boy, he's going off script.
[8364.06s -> 8387.29s]  Here we go. So you can also spend frog coins here. Welcome to the Frog Coin Emporium. You're a first
[8387.29s -> 8392.81s]  timer, aren't you? Listen up. The green coins you find periodically are frog coins. Accumulate them
[8392.81s -> 8403.11s]  and you can buy items at Tadpole Pond. So as you see, this is the real currency. Bracer
[8404.31s -> 8411.45s]  raises defense, raises allies' battle power, raises party's entire, all the party's defense,
[8412.41s -> 8421.03s]  raises the whole party's attack power, but I don't, I never used them. This is the premium currency,
[8421.03s -> 8432.46s]  yes. Welcome to the juice bar. Are you a card member? Even Todofsky has a membership here.
[8433.18s -> 8436.30s]  Sorry, you're limited to this menu if you don't have a current membership card.
[8437.50s -> 8450.04s]  You can buy a froggy drink. Party recovers 30 HP. These are actually pretty good. I'll buy a few of
[8450.84s -> 8463.48s]  them. Put the froggy stick on. Did I get the secret coin that I only have one chance at? No,
[8464.20s -> 8477.67s]  I didn't. Melody Bay. Play notes by jumping on the tadpoles. Let's hear your melody.
[8480.07s -> 8493.26s]  Now this is, there are a ton of deep secrets in this game. You have to play certain songs
[8493.26s -> 8508.63s]  for Todofsky and some of them are very difficult to figure out which ones you should play. It takes
[8508.63s -> 8514.97s]  playing through this whole game and knowing very specific random things. Is that something you
[8514.97s -> 8519.85s]  composed? No, that's not the right melody at all. Yeah, he's looking for like the right melody.
[8520.81s -> 8525.13s]  I'm the composer Todofsky. I am trying to create my next masterpiece, but I've got composer's block.
[8526.47s -> 8530.62s]  You want a music lesson from moi? No. Fine, be that way.
[8541.91s -> 8553.56s]  He's still explaining the game. I've got this dream of becoming a composer. I want to be as
[8553.56s -> 8561.24s]  famous as Todofsky. My favorite song? It's Frogfusious's suite number 18,
[8561.24s -> 8570.49s]  so la mi re do re do re. Todofsky's fond of it too. Okay, there it is. That's one of them.
[8573.74s -> 8584.57s]  So la mi re do re do re. I'm just gonna write it down. So la mi re do re do re.
[8585.53s -> 8588.09s]  So la mi re do re do re.
[8590.41s -> 8600.31s]  Okay, I don't know which one of these is do. It's the start, right? Do is the first one,
[8600.31s -> 8607.18s]  right? It's do re mi la. So this is up here would be do. Is it descending or descending? I don't
[8607.18s -> 8621.75s]  remember. So do re mi fa so. Do re mi fa so la so. Do re mi fa so la. Do re, this is the second one.
[8623.30s -> 8649.56s]  Do re do re do re. So now I just do this. Isn't that something you composed? No, it's the other way
[8649.56s -> 8666.42s]  then. So it's up this way. I did it backwards. It was upside down. So this is do re mi fa so.
[8669.61s -> 8705.85s]  Do re mi fa so la. Do re mi re. So I need do re do re do re. That's it. Is that something you did?
[8707.40s -> 8717.83s]  That's not what? See the five lines between the second and third lines from the top.
[8717.83s -> 8727.85s]  Okay, so between the second and third lines from the top lies do. Keep going up and the notes are
[8727.85s -> 8738.10s]  do re mi. Go down and you'll do do ti la so fa. Okay, right. So it's do. Okay, I need this. I need
[8738.10s -> 8747.50s]  this. I need a screenshot that I can't screenshot this. It's on a console. So going up is do re
[8747.50s -> 8760.52s]  mi and then going down is do ti la so fa. Do re mi ti la so fa. Use your phone. Oh my god,
[8760.52s -> 8776.09s]  I fucking missed it. Okay, I'll get it. Okay, the notes. Second third lines is do. So you got do.
[8776.09s -> 8787.45s]  I'm taking a picture. Okay, so do re mi is like up that way. So that's do re mi and then down is
[8787.45s -> 8804.54s]  that's do ti la so fa. Got it. Okay, let's get it on there. Use chat screenshot instead.
[8805.74s -> 8809.10s]  All right, so do is between the second. So this is do between second and third line.
[8809.98s -> 8816.73s]  Do, right. So then I need to do. No, no, no, no, no. Back it up. Back it up. Fuck. I need to.
[8825.35s -> 8834.71s]  Thank you, Otter Fiend for the 10 community subs. Thanks a lot, Otter. Thanks for the sub drop.
[8836.82s -> 8850.15s]  I'll get it right out. Okay, so the out. So I mean, it's so. So that is do ti la so fa. Okay.
[8851.11s -> 8863.13s]  Then that we need to do la. So there we go. We got do ti la is mi. So this is do re mi
[8865.00s -> 8895.98s]  and then re do re do re. Re, re do. So this is do re do. I almost jumped. Do re do re. Got it. There
[8895.98s -> 8901.46s]  it is. That's it. This is the melody I've been looking for. Thank you for the inspiration.
[8902.02s -> 8907.38s]  Please take this as a token of my gratitude. Received an alto card. If I ever need help with
[8907.38s -> 8915.16s]  my compositions again, I'll look for you here. Until then, adios. I feel like I do that a lot,
[8915.16s -> 8919.00s]  what he just did. That like look at the air with your hands and go oh. I do that all the time.
[8925.78s -> 8935.50s]  All right, so I got my card now. Oh, I'm going to bed. Can't wait to graduate from music school
[8935.50s -> 8947.27s]  and start composing. I just stole that person's music. May I help you? Oh, an alto card. What
[8947.27s -> 8955.38s]  would you like? You can buy elixirs now. Party recovers 80 HP. That's a little out of budget,
[8955.38s -> 8966.97s]  though. All right, now I think let me go back here and ask you another question. I think he's back
[8966.97s -> 8972.18s]  and he gives you vague. Yeah, he's gonna give me vague things that I need to find.
[8973.14s -> 8989.29s]  Well, maybe not yet. I think I probably have to unlock it. Just grind until I have 99 elixirs.
[8990.17s -> 8997.27s]  That would be the most boring fucking thing I could ever do. I would hate that so much.
[8998.15s -> 9008.62s]  Okay, a rose wave. You can't jump on or off when the block is blue.
[9008.62s -> 9020.14s]  Try jumping when the block turns yellow. Now these move around in different places. I can go,
[9020.14s -> 9038.30s]  yeah. I have to go across. Shit, it's okay. Did he find Luigi? Um, a long time ago. I did find
[9038.30s -> 9065.62s]  Luigi. He's doing like crack behind one of the houses. Let's get that coin. No. Okay, can I go
[9065.62s -> 9081.85s]  from here? That didn't really... I had loved the froggy stick. I was gonna say I hate the froggy
[9081.85s -> 9097.13s]  stick and I just immediately corrected myself. The giant enemy spider. Yeah, those things suck.
[9097.93s -> 9116.47s]  Blocking these at all. All right, so I need to go around. I eventually will come around this way.
[9121.03s -> 9126.26s]  Oh, I remember this part. I'm gonna knock them both off and go get the treasure.
[9127.06s -> 9146.63s]  What a fun game. I'm not timing it right. The giant enemy spider is based on real Japanese history.
[9148.39s -> 9172.31s]  Is it really? That's really cool. Jebaited. He's jebaited. Are you sure? I feel like I've
[9172.31s -> 9187.83s]  heard that before. All right, I can't screw this up. I already did. I'm just gonna block.
[9191.88s -> 9222.90s]  Damn it. Shit. Oh, I blew it. Oh no. Now I have to... Wait, hold on. Okay. I fucking desynced it.
[9224.06s -> 9251.56s]  Now I have to desync enough times again to resync it. That's good enough. I'm gonna lose my fucking
[9251.56s -> 9264.71s]  mind. Shit. I remember this. I remembered even years later doing this and being like,
[9264.71s -> 9293.94s]  nah, I kind of don't care. I just keep going. All right, nobody move. Got it. Frog coin. What?
[9293.94s -> 9316.81s]  I can get that. All right, wrap it around. Watch out for those bandits. They steal. A penny? No,
[9316.81s -> 9335.91s]  that's ten. That's ten coins. The big ones. Damn it. Miscalculated. Pick it down. Yeah, money's
[9335.91s -> 9346.17s]  worth a lot. Come on. I gotta spend money. Let's see. Does this keep going this way? It does.
[9348.07s -> 9353.67s]  I missed all of it. Every single one. I still didn't. Unbelievable. That's truly not fucking
[9353.67s -> 9377.82s]  believable. Okay, let's go. I don't... No, hold on. I think there's other things I can do here.
[9378.62s -> 9386.54s]  What else can I do? What else is this gonna do for me? Something cool? Nothing cool at all?
[9387.50s -> 9394.63s]  There's no secrets? There has to be a secret. No secret. Maybe there is. I don't remember.
[9395.43s -> 9397.77s]  All right, let's get the heck out of here.
[9411.99s -> 9423.96s]  Full health. Watch out for the bandit. Damn it. He got it.
[9429.10s -> 9431.58s]  Well, why did you run into me then if you're just gonna run away?
[9438.39s -> 9449.51s]  No face cam, resident sleeper, no tuber reactions. What am I even doing here? Holy shit, he almost
[9449.51s -> 9478.01s]  insta-killed me. Fucking fart on stream. I'm not going to do that, so don't worry.
[9478.73s -> 9484.25s]  Those of you that are concerned, don't ask me why. Those of you that are concerned saying,
[9484.25s -> 9495.75s]  no, don't, don't do that. Why are you assuming that I would do something like that? Why would
[9495.75s -> 9502.63s]  I do that? Why would I just turn like my ass up and just go like...
[9512.78s -> 9519.40s]  Why would I do that? Guys, I am a super embarrassed farter and I want to just explain this.
[9520.84s -> 9527.16s]  I don't fart unless like I like go into a closed room and make sure that nobody is within like 50
[9527.16s -> 9539.83s]  feet of me. If there are people within like a hundred foot radius of me, I don't do it and I
[9539.83s -> 9560.52s]  like escape. This is actually kind of bad. I'm gonna die. Damn it, why did he run away?
[9561.59s -> 9585.13s]  Why did you run? Jerma, do you hear me? What? Snuck that one. This is cool, right here, go.
[9585.69s -> 9601.05s]  Wait, don't do that. It's the army. All right, people, form ranks. Attention,
[9601.05s -> 9612.22s]  shelled warriors, hooded sorcerers, and last but not least, ground wing goombas. This is our finest
[9612.30s -> 9617.74s]  moment. The koopa troop is invincible. We shall be victorious. The bridge is down,
[9617.74s -> 9627.37s]  but we'll find a way to get back in. Move out, on the double. Snap. That's right, Bowser in this
[9627.37s -> 9639.46s]  game, whenever he doesn't move, he snaps his fingers. It's fucking awesome. Bowser and his
[9639.46s -> 9653.43s]  troops must be on their way to Bowser's keep. Come on, Rosetown's just up ahead. Rosetown.
[9656.74s -> 9665.19s]  Ooh, you all right? See, arrows come flying out from the forest and when you're hit, you can't move.
[9665.99s -> 9676.44s]  See, look, I can't move a muscle. Now I know how our scarecrow feels. Since the day of shooting
[9676.44s -> 9687.93s]  star fell into the forest, arrows have been showering our town. Get inside, quick, get inside.
[9688.82s -> 9698.55s]  I tell you, it's scary out here, where someone's gotta pump the water, like this. One, two, one,
[9698.55s -> 9708.09s]  two, one, two, one, two. Someone's gotta do it. I'm desperately waiting for the comedic moment
[9708.09s -> 9715.11s]  where I can make a noise when I get hit, but this ain't a comedy stream. This is a nostalgia stream.
[9715.75s -> 9738.98s]  Item shop. Ding. And then to get this one, you gotta, you gotta fall to the ceiling.
[9743.72s -> 9750.12s]  But hey, why don't we uh, why don't we go in here? Should I go in here? What do you think? I think
[9750.12s -> 9780.12s]  it's time to go in here. I know, I know. I'm just very excited. No, no. The audio's desynced? Like in
[9780.12s -> 9816.65s]  the game? It's not. Luigi's behind the house. Oh, maybe I should go find him. That's weird. Here we go.
[9836.66s -> 9841.61s]  It hurt me with your childish pranks. Attention, Toadstool, you're coming with me. Zip your lip.
[9842.63s -> 9857.00s]  Help, help, somebody help me! Oh my god. It's, it's, it's, it's mom. Mom, we have a guest.
[9858.44s -> 9870.44s]  Yes dear, I hear you have. Hello there, aren't you Mario? For real? Well, you have the hat and the
[9870.44s -> 9885.53s]  funky stash. Are you really Mario? Wrong number. You bet. How do I know it's you? You might just be
[9885.53s -> 9895.32s]  pulling my leg. Show me, prove it. All right, okay. Mario, you want to play with me? I'm playing save
[9895.32s -> 9902.66s]  the world. Now, Gaz, Mario might be a little tired, dear. Aw, come on mom. You never play with me. It's
[9902.66s -> 9910.74s]  no fun playing alone. Oh dear, Mario. I hate to ask, but could you play with Gaz for a little while?
[9912.33s -> 9923.32s]  Yes! Okay, Mario just bought the farm, so you can be Bowser. I'll be Gino, okay? Ready? Let's play
[9923.32s -> 9934.86s]  from where I left off. All set. Oh scary, but just watch me. Better watch out, Bowser, because Gino's
[9934.86s -> 9947.88s]  gonna blow you away. Take this! Your turn, Bowser. Easy, Mario. It's just, it's just a game, Mario.
[9947.88s -> 9953.77s]  It's just a kid. Ow! Oh no, if he keeps this app unfinished. All right, you asked for it.
[9954.49s -> 9960.65s]  The super duper custom patented one star, one star on Yelp. Shooting star shot.
[9963.77s -> 9976.65s]  Oops, I think I missed. Oh, Mario. Mario, you, Mario, you good? Everybody shut up. This is the
[9976.65s -> 10050.06s]  most important thing in my whole life. There he is, there he is. Shh. It's not Luigi.
[10050.38s -> 10064.34s]  You know, for the longest time I thought his name was Geno. I was like 12. I thought it was Geno.
[10064.34s -> 10081.75s]  That was a 10 out of 10 Mario dream. Yeah, Mario, maybe you shouldn't eat like a pint of ice cream
[10081.75s -> 10088.92s]  before bed anymore. Mom, you'll never believe what I just saw. It was amazing. I just saw Gino walk
[10088.92s -> 10095.56s]  into the forest. Neat, huh? Yes dear, that's nice dear. And isn't Gino the one who broke my lamp the
[10095.64s -> 10103.16s]  other day? Oh my, it was just, this is real. I swear mom, really, it's true. I saw him outside.
[10104.04s -> 10106.76s]  All right, Gaz, let's hear it. What are you trying to get out of this this time?
[10108.49s -> 10115.58s]  Mom, I didn't do anything. I really saw Geno. And she's, I guess it's implied that she's like
[10115.58s -> 10126.09s]  screaming out. Oh, this boy is impossible. Sorry if I hurt you, but what would Geno want in the
[10126.09s -> 10146.12s]  forest? What would Geno want in the forest? I'm going to buy some shit. Mario, good to have a
[10146.12s -> 10152.26s]  customer at last. What do you need? What do I have? I have eight, I should, I need syrups.
[10153.30s -> 10166.97s]  I have, I might as well get five of these. Maybe one or two, a couple more of these. Hey Mario,
[10166.97s -> 10173.06s]  it's so nice of you to drop by the shop. What can I do for you? Thick shirt, thick pants.
[10173.86s -> 10184.52s]  Oh, we need thick shirt, thick pants. Jump shoes are actually really good. Wake up pin
[10185.40s -> 10190.97s]  prevents sleep. You won't be turned into a mushroom, prevents fear. These are way too
[10190.97s -> 10198.62s]  expensive. Let's see, I'm going to sell some stuff too. Jump shoes, they, as you see,
[10199.74s -> 10206.70s]  drop your defense, but they make your magic attack really good, which is my, obviously my jump
[10206.70s -> 10214.33s]  ability. What is my defense at right now? 22 and 19. 22 and my magic, yeah, that's actually, no,
[10214.33s -> 10223.80s]  that's good. I go up to 23 magic attack. Yeah, I'm putting on. True form versus wake up. Mushrooms
[10223.80s -> 10234.34s]  and it prevents mute. I don't think this upcoming boss does air crows, but do lose. Sorry, put the
[10234.34s -> 10242.94s]  thick pants on. Put the thick shirt on. I'm going to keep the wake up pin, but I'm going to sell
[10242.94s -> 10257.26s]  this other stuff. Okay, I think we're good. I'm going to maybe get a couple more items.
[10257.98s -> 10273.56s]  All right, that should be all right, I think. If it's not, it's not. Everyone is, you're about
[10273.56s -> 10277.16s]  to hear the best song in the whole game, by the way. This is, yeah, I would, I've seen a lot of
[10277.16s -> 10281.72s]  resident sleepers. I would wake up for this one because this is the best song in the whole game.
[10289.13s -> 10294.86s]  Still in Rosedown. I'm laughing my ass off. Yeah, this is the, we're going to be bopping here real
[10294.86s -> 10344.52s]  quick. Into the forest maze. You ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? No, I don't, I don't, I want
[10344.52s -> 10371.45s]  to hit the arrow. All right, we got it. That's why I'm going to be shooting pretty hard the whole
[10371.45s -> 10391.69s]  song. That was a lot of fucking damage. And now he's poisoned. That went pretty good. Malo's like
[10391.69s -> 10402.73s]  dead. He is going to die. Nope. I'm going to use one of the mushrooms because shit. He's almost
[10402.73s -> 10414.10s]  dead. I don't want to use any unnecessary mushroom. Don't worry guys, the song comes right back right
[10414.10s -> 10438.58s]  now. I think there's something in these. I know there is something. I think there's like a frog
[10438.58s -> 10482.33s]  coin or something in one of these. Star? Yeah, I think it is a star. You missed! What? What do you mean I missed?
[10483.13s -> 10496.65s]  You missed? How does that make any sense? What the hell? Did I check this one?
[10503.43s -> 10506.79s]  What is this song called? The song is called Beware the Forest Mushrooms.
[10508.95s -> 10519.98s]  There are probably 500 remixes of this song on YouTube. This is one of those songs that
[10519.98s -> 10524.06s]  everybody just seems to love over and over and over again and everybody thinks is like the
[10524.06s -> 10529.26s]  greatest song that Nintendo has ever put in a game and they won't put it in any other fucking game.
[10530.06s -> 10533.74s]  They won't put it anywhere. I don't even forget about like Gino and Smash Brothers. Why don't
[10533.74s -> 10540.58s]  they just put this song in? Why? It's only in this game and everyone's like yeah that's probably the
[10540.58s -> 10547.94s]  best Mario song ever. I don't want to hear like 15 different Nintendo official remixes of Rainbow
[10547.94s -> 10560.17s]  Road. I want this! Gosh darn it. Square owns the rights to the song? Do they? No, I don't.
[10561.37s -> 10573.26s]  What? All right, I need some levels here guys. So there are these characters that Square owns in
[10573.26s -> 10579.58s]  this game. What the hell are you going to do with these characters? I never understood that. Well,
[10579.58s -> 10583.42s]  you see the thing is like everybody like really loves these characters but Square owns them
[10583.42s -> 10592.30s]  and they just lock them in a fucking box and nobody can look at them. Nobody can buy them.
[10592.30s -> 10597.80s]  Nobody can look at them. Hey can you guys like do anything with those characters? No.
[10599.03s -> 10611.72s]  Can you sell those characters to somebody that will? No. Please? Oh I got Psychopath. Good. Please
[10611.72s -> 10619.21s]  go. I'm not even like Smash but like if like some of the characters that they brought into this
[10619.21s -> 10623.37s]  game into the universe they're really cool. They're really fun interesting characters. They
[10623.37s -> 10626.17s]  could be put anywhere. You could put them in another Mario game for all that matters.
[10627.13s -> 10652.01s]  You guys are going straight up magic huh? What are we doing? 29, 30, 21, 22. He's doing a lot
[10652.01s -> 10663.46s]  of damage. Square didn't even let Final Fantasy music in for the Final Fantasy characters in
[10664.02s -> 10681.46s]  besides one track. Shit I missed it. Like how much? Was it just like a stupid amount or something?
[10682.98s -> 10689.40s]  I wonder if Nintendo ever approached Square and said hey can we just buy all the intellectual
[10689.40s -> 10694.84s]  property of the characters that are in that Mario game? This seriously is like a Disney and
[10694.84s -> 10700.04s]  Sony fucking bullshit. That really is what this is. Disney and Sony come together and do like
[10700.04s -> 10713.54s]  Spider-Man movies and then yeah that's the same the exact same thing that happened. That was a
[10713.54s -> 10727.98s]  rock because now there's a bunch of these cool characters that we it's just no sorry you can't
[10727.98s -> 10733.42s]  say anything about them ever again just but I just enjoy the thing that existed that one time. Why
[10733.42s -> 10743.08s]  can't you just enjoy this thing? I do enjoy this thing. Well good. This thing was 20 fucking years
[10743.08s -> 10750.44s]  ago. Well enjoy it. I know but can I can you do any can I have another one? No enjoy this one.
[10750.44s -> 10756.12s]  I do I I already do. I love it so much that I want you to do another one so I will buy it.
[10756.12s -> 10774.17s]  No go back and play that one again. Oh I'm getting angry. He's losing it.
[10774.49s -> 10795.51s]  Oh first time today. I didn't do all night. What an embarrassment. It's all Disney's fault.
[10796.95s -> 10802.04s]  All right we got Mario here. Hey thank you. Jerma sucks for the five community subs.
[10802.92s -> 10820.65s]  Appreciate that. Thank you. We got super jump. What do you guys want to go now? We do everybody
[10820.65s -> 10824.97s]  gave me so much shit when I talked about in the very beginning of this stream that when I was
[10824.97s -> 10831.21s]  younger I just picked power only for a character HP only for another character and magic only for
[10831.21s -> 10837.21s]  another character and I was called a doofus and now you guys are doing that exact thing.
[10838.01s -> 10855.51s]  Okay that's 65% want me to continue to do power. Jeff just came in with five community subs. Thank
[10855.51s -> 10865.72s]  you Jeff. Thank you Jeff and Jerma sucks both of you. You said not to ruin your childhood. Yeah
[10865.80s -> 10880.54s]  that's true. I did say that. Don't do that. I know it's in one of these. Is this the last one?
[10880.54s -> 10886.44s]  It's in this one. Did I like bait myself on a thing that I'm misremembering?
[10890.46s -> 10895.66s]  Thank you the fax machine. This is three sub drops right in a row. Fax machine with five community
[10895.66s -> 10907.26s]  subs. Thank you. Jeff, Jerma sucks and fax machine. This is just like ET on the Atari.
[10908.62s -> 10921.86s]  Malo's dead and like I said it doesn't even need to be a Mario just anywhere. I would love it if
[10921.86s -> 10928.10s]  Malo was taught like fucking healthy eating habits in like a DS game or something. Like I would
[10928.10s -> 10945.29s]  fine it'd be cool. Why? It would be cool. I don't know. For your son or daughter to think it was
[10945.29s -> 10960.31s]  cool. That would piss me off. Why would that make you so mad? That would piss me off if he was like
[10960.31s -> 10973.14s]  in a vegetable eating tutorial game. Just play WoW Classic. No I'm not going to play WoW Classic.
[10973.94s -> 10987.06s]  I think I'm I got an opportunity here. I need to take a mushroom. How am I doing on I got a flower
[10987.06s -> 11004.58s]  jar. That's just easy. Might as well. I was gonna say remind me to pick those up. Some of them are
[11004.58s -> 11028.98s]  poisonous though I think. Yeah pick those ones up. No I'm looking for secrets. Wait a minute. The
[11028.98s -> 11033.86s]  first Jerma stream I tuned into was WoW and it put me off from watching you for years.
[11035.61s -> 11043.38s]  Holy shit. Well what are you doing here? What made you come back?
[11050.31s -> 11056.23s]  You know like okay as like a broadcaster that is that like is so horrible to hear that but I
[11056.23s -> 11062.89s]  understand why. That's the worst part about all that. Like hearing that oh no dude I watched that
[11062.89s -> 11066.73s]  stream and I was like I'm not fucking watching this person for like years. Like I'm like oh
[11066.73s -> 11077.43s]  fuck man really but I know why you said that. What do you mean lol broadcaster? What is this?
[11078.07s -> 11089.40s]  I'm sorry am I doing like am I doing like messages in fucking like I was gonna say
[11089.96s -> 11110.06s]  smoke signals but I couldn't find the word. Check this out this is gonna be fucking awesome. No
[11110.06s -> 11123.62s]  don't all run away I wanted to get this. Broadcaster lol. That's a lot of coins. He thinks he's a
[11123.62s -> 11145.50s]  broadcaster. Whatever. Now let's heal up. Wasteful but I don't care and I'm gonna take this flower jar
[11145.50s -> 11149.90s]  and I pissed off at least two people. They're not gonna watch for years after I did that.
[11150.62s -> 11171.50s]  Here we go. Follow them. Now there is a secret in this forest. I forget what it is. You don't
[11171.50s -> 11176.06s]  actually follow Gino. You do a different path and it gives you a huge treasure. I don't remember
[11176.06s -> 11192.38s]  which way it is. I forget. I'm sure I'll come back. And it's got double tap. Do you want the
[11192.38s -> 11213.80s]  directions? Uh no. No I don't think so. Somebody gives it to you eventually. I want this to be an
[11213.80s -> 11231.21s]  organic experience. He thinks he's broadcasting right now. Where are you Gino? There you are.
[11232.01s -> 11243.99s]  No. For some reason I have this weird image in my brain of if I ever did like an event
[11243.99s -> 11250.60s]  where I was on a stage or something like it for twitch like oh twitchcon and here's germa985

[11261.88s -> 11268.98s]  favorite broadcaster germa985 and the crowd just erupts in fucking laughter you know like is that
[11268.98s -> 11276.63s]  is that what would happen like he's just a broadcaster and then I would get wicked nervous
[11276.63s -> 11282.63s]  backstage I'd be like what the fuck man I would have like my magician's outfit on

[11958.09s -> 11967.98s]  the truth I'm a visitor from above and this is the form I'm borrowing briefly you mean like from
[11967.98s -> 11976.47s]  the sky or something higher than that I'm afraid do you too know anything about the star road got
[11976.47s -> 11984.86s]  it completely in the dark well it's a big mess up there right now and it concerns you too let me
[11984.86s -> 11993.03s]  explain you've heard of wishing upon a shooting star at the star road your wishes transformed
[11993.03s -> 12001.40s]  into a star when it's granted it then turns into a shooting star and falls down to earth so you see
[12001.40s -> 12008.15s]  the star road plays an integral role in granting wishes but ever since a sword destroyed the star
[12008.15s -> 12015.66s]  road everything's come to a halt no stars have been made since the way things stand yours is a
[12015.66s -> 12025.64s]  world where wishes can't come true anymore are you saying this star is part of your star way
[12025.64s -> 12033.88s]  that star road my fluffy little friend yes that star is a broken piece of the star road
[12034.44s -> 12041.62s]  I'm here to find them all and repair the star road the broken star pieces there are seven all

[16029.45s -> 16036.89s]  once again there it is finally first time I've seen it the worst speedrun I've ever seen
[16040.12s -> 16055.64s]  um I'm sorry to hear that all right I'm really not using items right now I really need to and

[16165.00s -> 16175.58s]  oddest parts of the game the place is fucking weird booster is such a nice place I miss my
[16175.58s -> 16182.14s]  fortress I miss the good old days toadstool screaming in terror of mario rushing in to save
[16182.14s -> 16192.58s]  her oh jesus mario oh okay okay uh calm down don't let him see you like this hey how you been
[16192.58s -> 16201.13s]  no not like that idiot wrong tone needs more confidence you what are you doing here
[16201.93s -> 16206.17s]  if toadstool were at my castle waiting to be rescued she'd be crying like a baby
[16214.65s -> 16238.47s]  oh did I just hear some voices I can't believe it it's mario I'm up here that voice it's toadstool
[16239.69s -> 16248.95s]  I thought she'd gone away but she's been stuck here well I guess I'll be returning to my castle
[16248.95s -> 16287.50s]  now out of my way shorty it's locked what you're still here that look on your face

[16314.54s -> 16322.76s]  thank me later mario and his friends have joined the koopa troop or so they're pretending bowser
[16322.76s -> 16334.57s]  joins the group by the way for those of you wondering the first game and one of the only
[16334.57s -> 16357.02s]  games where bowser is a playable character the first time they did it and yes malo is gone

[16392.66s -> 16407.82s]  I'm talking like a main like mario video game you can't count a party game for I can't you
[16407.82s -> 16427.67s]  cannot replace mario unfortunately uh what do you have for items nothing yet welcome to booster
[16438.02s -> 16445.22s]  hello there booster is busy right now so he can't play come back some other time or you can try to
[16445.22s -> 16488.79s]  force your way in like right now blizzard it's chilly in here I still don't know what terrorize

[16574.50s -> 16586.57s]  booster the first booster the second booster the third booster the fourth booster the fifth
[16587.13s -> 16601.29s]  booster the sixth and there's booster of the creep all right mustache beard eye patch okay
[16601.37s -> 16611.59s]  kind of is it yeah booster's voice
[16616.90s -> 16618.18s]  what's the big rush
[16627.83s -> 16634.31s]  I'm booster and this is my famous tower of amusement normally I welcome visitors to play
[16634.31s -> 16643.34s]  with me in my sniffits however a girl fell out of the sky and into my lap recently since then I've
[16643.34s -> 16650.15s]  been busy keeping her happy and entertained I no longer have the time to play so please enjoy
[16650.15s -> 16681.29s]  yourself at your own risk please refrain from bothering booster holy shit they did a lot of
[16681.29s -> 16715.40s]  damage oh fuck gotta be careful bye-bye let's heal while I still have a second mid-bush
[16716.28s -> 16748.74s]  oh take a honey syrup though I love the base on this one flower tap he's just hiding
[16750.10s -> 16756.09s]  all right here we go remember I told you I was gonna have to do this later got it
[16757.13s -> 16782.26s]  first try yeah found a masher that is a new weapon for mario it's much better take a look at that 97
[16783.22s -> 16798.22s]  versus 77 it's ridiculous 97 attack in fact now that mario has that item I'm going to give the
[16798.22s -> 16817.93s]  work pants to mario mario cannot use the work pants never mind give bowser the work pants well
[16817.93s -> 16835.40s]  geno's got the work pants and he's doing damage shit too fast you miss malo well you might see
[16835.48s -> 16851.53s]  malo again eventually what was that loud noise outside check out boosters pass
[16851.53s -> 16860.23s]  that is a new area I think are you guys ready are you ready
[16894.60s -> 16899.88s]  how did they get the rights I can't believe they got the rights to mario
[16899.88s -> 16918.25s]  oh that thing on the left sucks doesn't take it only takes damage from
[16919.05s -> 16928.39s]  um magic I think it's a pain in the ass earwig well that was not correct
[16928.39s -> 16940.74s]  I know that one of them is hard to kill and that's a little bit
[16942.90s -> 16977.38s]  nice weather we're having I want to fight you you want to fight I do bash his head
[16986.50s -> 16987.62s]  snippet three is the most powerful
[16998.38s -> 17018.54s]  all three uh snippets are dead save mine game booster style is this on the SNES yes it is
[17019.42s -> 17027.02s]  superintendent entertainment system you can get it from the little SNES mini or by some other means
[17027.90s -> 17034.54s]  know how take a look at boosters family portraits in order from the oldest to the youngest
[17035.26s -> 17045.94s]  wait can I remember this I tried to I was doing I'll go for the one on the right
[17055.46s -> 17072.86s]  I'm gonna level up soon here okay here we go then it was okay then I think eye patch then it's a
[17072.86s -> 17079.02s]  little messy for me here I think then it's sunglasses and then regular glasses and then
[17079.02s -> 17109.54s]  here we are that's me the elder key they gaze into each other's eyes mario she's a bit shy
[17109.54s -> 17118.25s]  look the other way will you you can turn around now she says she's been locked up ever since she
[17118.25s -> 17133.03s]  took a bite out of booster so now she wants to help us stir up a little trouble the chomp new
[17133.03s -> 17144.22s]  party member unlocked chomp now you get the work no you don't chomp work pants 105 damage
[17146.50s -> 17148.58s]  don't have any more armor for gino but it's fine
[17149.86s -> 17191.37s]  I did that move sorry I'm an idiot all right got the chomp new weapon browser and
[17192.57s -> 17198.41s]  I love the architecture of this place this is really weird and interesting
[17203.96s -> 17223.85s]  and this full fine all right go across this way oops it's so weird it is so weird
[17224.81s -> 17233.38s]  there's a primo con these things that get hundreds of damage
[17234.34s -> 17241.69s]  that's the other one here in my life the best part of the game is mario challenges you to a game
[17241.69s -> 17258.65s]  of yahtzee I know what you're talking about that is pretty interesting part so weird mid mushroom
[17258.65s -> 17276.66s]  good let me make these jumps what's up there check cover behind yeah frog got it nice
[17277.62s -> 17317.93s]  there's always something figured I would have figured really this booster wario's dad do you
[17317.93s -> 17337.83s]  think but we'll never know the answer to that question wario's not in this game so there's no
[17337.83s -> 17353.29s]  spoiler I want to get all the frog coins it's important to me hey malo reach level eight
[17353.29s -> 17371.03s]  without even doing anything maybe some upgrades well I may as well just pick special every time
[17371.03s -> 17379.67s]  because there's no way anyone's you're never gonna pick anything else ever I'm just gonna
[17379.67s -> 17389.58s]  do special every time because that's what you're gonna pick that's what you're doing
[17390.14s -> 17410.41s]  oh that was two from 38 to 40 damn it you know I still don't know um what the mechanic is in
[17410.41s -> 17421.45s]  this room since I was 12 I just jump to the ones that are the tan tiles and I think it works
[17422.54s -> 17438.44s]  that's the right w exp isn't zone you guys I'm not gonna involve you guys
[17439.56s -> 17459.94s]  how do I get it wrong every single time every time room key zoom shoes oh yeah zoom shoes
[17460.90s -> 17478.26s]  let me take a look here 67d should I just give him to Bowser speed up by 10 huge magic defense
[17479.22s -> 17484.30s]  Bowser's kind of unstoppable if he's on yeah we're giving the zoom shoes to
[17485.90s -> 17493.74s]  zoomer ha ha funny it's like the word zoomer but it's funny ha ha zoomer
[17495.50s -> 17499.18s]  I'm so glad that you just said all that and stuff because I was gonna say like here are the zoomer

[17549.26s -> 17569.67s]  oh

[17903.61s -> 17909.21s]  there I was internally debating if me muting my microphone and going eating food downstairs
[17910.17s -> 17915.45s]  just getting like some like pasta or something and just eating and spend like a full hour down
[17920.30s -> 17923.98s]  but then I was like no I want to play I want to play this game I want to like continue to go

[21312.50s -> 21339.24s]  this all right let's get back to mushroom kingdom although i see how we're kind of at the halfway
[21339.24s -> 21345.70s]  point there's another false side of the overworld there but we still have a little little way to go
[21346.58s -> 21351.70s]  am i gonna do mario rpg tomorrow tomorrow the plan is terraria
[21362.86s -> 21367.98s]  and depending on how long we do that i may maybe we'll just transition back to play this
[21374.15s -> 21378.95s]  let's say we play terraria for like three four five hours and we're like all right that's it
[21379.51s -> 21389.85s]  maybe i'll hop back on this for an hour or two or something and you're gonna do the word problems
[21389.85s -> 21394.33s]  part of the game with no walkthrough word problems what do you mean word problem
[21398.39s -> 21402.68s]  i don't know what you mean mario welcome back you look like you're in one piece
[21405.37s -> 21412.52s]  princess i'm finally home and with mario and some wonderful new friends they saved my life
[21415.11s -> 21421.18s]  let's go find the chancellor we don't come on mario we mustn't keep the chancellor away
[21425.24s -> 21434.82s]  oh i know what you're talking about holy shit i forgot about that that's hell that area is
[21434.82s -> 21443.30s]  actual living fucking hell i love that area that's the hardest part of the whole game
[21443.94s -> 21447.70s]  that's the only game that actually that's the only part of the game that's a real true challenge
[21448.26s -> 21462.73s]  besides maybe the ship and then the last few encounters that is hard very hard
[21466.26s -> 21476.55s]  chancellor the princess is back thank goodness this has been a true nightmare i'm a nervous wreck
[21477.83s -> 21484.23s]  i know i've worried everyone but i'm fine i can take care of myself with a little help from mario
[21486.94s -> 21497.35s]  come everyone let's get out of this drafty door mario i hope you know how thankful we are
[21498.92s -> 21506.28s]  but you must tell me one thing how on earth can you trust bowser trust bowser what are you talking
[21507.24s -> 21522.57s]  mario what are you doing with what is going on here big gods chancellor listen everyone
[21522.57s -> 21529.18s]  relax mario's got things under control mario you brought bowser into the one place where you
[21529.18s -> 21538.97s]  have all of his enemies are yes yes i see bowser perhaps this time you told us your story
[21540.01s -> 21542.65s]  what exactly did you mean when you said you had bigger fish to fry
[21545.56s -> 21560.12s]  can't tell them the truth if this gets out i'm finished excuse me sir perhaps i can set the stage
[21560.12s -> 21566.63s]  and the others can add their comments along the way the princess bowser and mario were thrown in
[21566.63s -> 21571.50s]  different directions after a terrible explosion something huge crashed through star road high
[21571.50s -> 21591.32s]  above bowser's place and went boom where the fuck did mario go there was a gigantic sword now
[21591.32s -> 21597.59s]  bowser's keep has been taken over by monsters to work for some creep game smithy they've thrown
[21597.59s -> 21603.67s]  me out of my own i mean i decided to take a vacation they can't do this to me
[21607.19s -> 21613.83s]  anyway i was working on a plan to get my house back mario walked up to me and begged me to let
[21613.83s -> 21620.74s]  him join the koopa troop i had no choice but to let him in it was pathetic that's not what happened
[21620.74s -> 21628.73s]  no it's okay mario we know bowser's stretching the truth a little and mallet how about you why
[21628.73s -> 21635.74s]  are you traveling with mario well because mario is helping me find my real home and my parents
[21636.46s -> 21643.13s]  that's why we're on the road together what this is dreadful news awful horrible
[21643.93s -> 21651.29s]  i hope you find your real parents soon and um gino was it why are you and mario
[21652.25s -> 21659.78s]  the star road has been destroyed i'm here to fix it mario is helping me search for the star pieces
[21659.78s -> 21671.30s]  i need them to rebuild the road star pieces the star road grants our wishes unless we find all
[21671.30s -> 21677.82s]  the star pieces and fix the star road we can kiss our dreams goodbye what this is dreadful news
[21677.82s -> 21689.98s]  horrible isn't it indeed for example say bowser kidnapped you without the aid of the star road
[21690.54s -> 21697.48s]  you'd probably never be rescued actually that sounds pretty good to me let's just forget about
[21697.48s -> 21705.93s]  all these star things ah great bowser then you can just kiss your precious keep goodbye hey what
[21706.81s -> 21714.98s]  ah let's see mario can't find stars poster will be mine but i won't get my keep back and
[21714.98s -> 21720.66s]  wish mario finds a star so if i want to keep back i need a star thing but ah run that past me one
[21720.66s -> 21728.28s]  more time just ignore that idiot i just don't think i could take a word without a world without
[21728.28s -> 21737.08s]  wishes we need to go and find those star pieces now princess you can't be serious you're not
[21737.08s -> 21743.75s]  thinking of joining them are you this is sheer madness you're a princess what will people say
[21743.75s -> 21751.21s]  hey i don't care things seem so hopeless right now i'm tired i think i need to go lie down in my
[21751.21s -> 21768.84s]  room for a while mario malo gino and bowser you too look wait that's fucking mario now that
[21769.64s -> 21775.34s]  thanks to mario the princess is back i now declare this date to be known forever as
[21776.54s -> 21782.57s]  hey wait a minute you don't suppose who would have been this smithy who attacked our kingdom
[21782.57s -> 21786.89s]  i fear we have no cause to rejoice in fact mario we must ask you for yet another favor
[21787.69s -> 21793.32s]  please on behalf of all of us you must defeat smithy it is the only way we shall ever live in
[21793.32s -> 21822.52s]  peace again princess told stools home safe but she has decided to stay with him but sorry guys
[21823.32s -> 21838.62s]  it ain't gonna be like that please mario take me along with you please don't worry grandma
[21838.62s -> 21843.88s]  helped me through this one so no one will ever notice that i'm gone let's find us a star
[21845.00s -> 21847.72s]  but i wonder where it could be i have absolutely no idea do you
[21848.84s -> 21860.76s]  mario at times like these what should we do we should ask grandpa my grandpa should know
[21862.02s -> 21875.21s]  okay then let's do it just as i thought toadstool joins the party once again you want to go see how
[21875.77s -> 21895.18s]  how toadstool is uh pretending to be still here grandma thanks for putting up with all my selfish
[21895.18s -> 21903.11s]  demands don't worry princess a little invincible do you see the world it makes them friends help
[21903.11s -> 21911.85s]  destroy smithy just make sure nobody looks at my face mario's beside me everything's going to be
[21911.85s -> 21920.74s]  all right so don't worry you take care grandma you hear i feel like i'm growing younger just
[21920.74s -> 21943.82s]  talking with you people i thought you thought that was a skull that's all right i did i've
[21943.82s -> 21953.22s]  already found the question mark i did i'm gonna save it i think this is a pretty good stopping
[21953.22s -> 21966.98s]  point i'm gonna hang out and do the bits and the subs and stuff how long is the game probably
[21966.98s -> 21975.67s]  another another full stream and we'll probably do it it's probably like another seven-ish hours
[21975.67s -> 21987.13s]  in the game six to seven hours something like that maybe a little bit more but yeah i i love
[21987.13s -> 21997.00s]  this game i hope if you've never played it before then you get to see and enjoy it too
[21997.00s -> 21999.88s]  and those of you that have played it before remember how much fun it was
[22000.84s -> 22014.70s]  oh wait wait wait wait wait we missed the score up again but there are a lot of little easter eggs
[22014.70s -> 22019.34s]  that we have not even seen yet so we'll probably see those well depending on how long we go tomorrow
[22020.06s -> 22033.59s]  this felt like a video game play it was awesome yeah sometimes i mean yeah obviously i was doing
[22033.59s -> 22046.74s]  like voices and stuff but it's fun just to hang out very comfy for real but i will see you guys
[22046.74s -> 22053.75s]  tomorrow we'll keep going after terraria maybe i'll jump back on here for like another couple
[22053.75s -> 22069.80s]  hours depending on how it goes but that's where we're gonna end thank you for watching as always
[22075.90s -> 22086.97s]  let's get the bits open and go back a little earlier today here we are see you tomorrow if
[22087.05s -> 22092.47s]  you're coming back or see you next uh next time whenever you decide to join us again
[22098.17s -> 22105.37s]  and thank you to gnarly for the 250 two dollars and 50 cents uh i had this really weird dream
[22105.37s -> 22109.93s]  last night you were streaming minecraft in the middle of the day with a bunch of mods installed
[22110.49s -> 22119.59s]  there were no jokes gaps or even gaffs or even commentary from you you kind of just kept quiet
[22119.67s -> 22125.59s]  occasionally mumbling to yourself you seemed mad at one point there was a jump scare and instead
[22125.59s -> 22131.67s]  of reacting with a scream or a laugh you just sighed and muttered god damn it under your breath
[22132.47s -> 22151.91s]  i wonder if you were even aware you were streaming i will never i don't think ever have an accidental
[22151.91s -> 22161.37s]  stream i go through so many rituals before i press the start streaming button there's no
[22161.37s -> 22174.68s]  it would be impossible what do you mean rituals just i just have like rituals like routines that
[22174.68s -> 22184.68s]  i do before i start you have any plans to do any other rpgs i think with the voice work it's great
[22184.68s -> 22192.44s]  i would love to see some more chill rpg streams yeah i mean chrono trigger is one of them after
[22192.44s -> 22199.46s]  i uh the next stream or two of mario rpg i could do that next that's also one of those just
[22200.76s -> 22210.02s]  you know greatest game of all time type stuff yeah maybe i if people like this and people
[22210.66s -> 22216.33s]  think this is a fun stream and a relaxing chill stream i think it is it's kind of up to you guys
[22218.97s -> 22224.25s]  but it seems like this was fun for a lot of people tonight so i mean kind of was testing the waters
[22224.25s -> 22241.83s]  tonight so we'll see but thank you too we also had lacronda gave 50 dollars before i was live
[22246.04s -> 22254.50s]  yeah lacronda gave 5 000 bits before i turned the stream on holy shit they say i go why isn't
[22254.50s -> 22265.21s]  germa streaming yet late streamer and you go live what kind of which are you that's 50 dollar
[22265.21s -> 22271.62s]  pre-stream bits and i didn't even know what happened lacronda if you're still here thank you
[22272.34s -> 22286.70s]  that's a lot really appreciate it 50 bucks it's time for slime thanks three dollars did you know
[22286.70s -> 22292.70s]  super mario was originally going to be called a superb mario until miyamoto convinced nintendo
[22293.90s -> 22302.15s]  that they should drop the b from the title really it's gonna be superb mario
[22306.12s -> 22313.24s]  miyamoto said convinced president of nintendo to drop the b is this is this is bullshit this
[22313.24s -> 22318.34s]  might be both this is bullshit isn't it superb no i'm getting it is it i mean it sounds like it
[22318.34s -> 22326.86s]  could be i don't know though he would adore bowser's inside story it has the same kind of
[22326.86s -> 22334.90s]  goofy charm not no random encounters that sounds cool why would they make that up i don't know
[22337.64s -> 22344.71s]  i guess it's real that's cool hey tingy thanks for the 250 you didn't even last 10 minutes
[22344.71s -> 22355.24s]  without swearing this stream i was much more relaxed today look at the stream title hey smelly
[22355.24s -> 22365.72s]  boy thanks for the 250 like 15 minutes in and you're still in let's player mode what no i was just
[22365.72s -> 22370.12s]  described look i played this game a lot of time so i'm just like really excited to explain and
[22370.12s -> 22385.13s]  talk about everything that i'm doing you were explaining the concept of currency
[22385.93s -> 22407.88s]  what if you don't know what that is oh my god what the fuck jesus 69 again this is what is this the
[22407.88s -> 22413.96s]  fifth fourth fifth sixth time fifth time in the last like two weeks that phylacter lich has given
[22414.68s -> 22424.81s]  69 subs this is like the fifth time you've done this maybe more they don't if i liked your lich i
[22424.81s -> 22443.02s]  don't remember well regardless that's um that's another 69 subs from phylactery on top of the
[22444.86s -> 22457.72s]  hundreds and hundreds of bits worth of dollars that's that's crazy everyone will be a sub soon
[22459.06s -> 22470.74s]  yeah sometimes i wonder what some of uh their occupation people's occupations are
[22472.62s -> 22479.56s]  i'd be a doctor in that case can you look at that i got this like itchy thing on my back can you
[22479.56s -> 22486.46s]  look at it no but for real that's you've given an astronomical amount of money to the channel over
[22486.46s -> 22494.78s]  the last month so thank you you are responsible for hundreds of fucking subs you've given hundreds
[22494.78s -> 22503.16s]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars thank you i still cannot believe that you would
[22503.16s -> 22523.56s]  give that many subs there pretty much every single string thanks a lot we also had oh my goodness
[22524.20s -> 22532.94s]  where are we over here all right right here may thank you may posting for the five dollars
[22533.98s -> 22539.10s]  germa are you gonna try to fight culex during this playthrough yes and also on all your times
[22539.10s -> 22543.42s]  playing this game how many times have you got a perfect hit with geno world that's the real
[22543.42s -> 22552.14s]  ultimate gamer move as far as i'm concerned i'm not sure i don't know if i i do know like the secret
[22552.14s -> 22561.14s]  jokey part but i know i'm not gonna do it i'm not gonna do the joke and those of you guys that know
[22561.14s -> 22566.26s]  the geno world meme i'm not gonna do it this playthrough i'm gonna actually beat it right i'm
[22566.26s -> 22579.06s]  gonna actually beat it but yes i'm going i'm going to i'm going to beat culex on this playthrough yes
[22583.30s -> 22591.53s]  oh no now phylacterlish gave 18 subs to make it so they had 420 gifted subs on the channel
[22591.53s -> 22597.94s]  think about that think about how many how many subs that is you're responsible for 420 subscriptions
[22607.88s -> 22621.06s]  they have fulfilled their promise of 420 get that is true phylacterly did you did say that before
[22621.06s -> 22627.51s]  and you've achieved that a few different ways it's the weed number it's the weed number
[22629.42s -> 22635.02s]  i know it's the weed number i know i know what the weed number is and then fly for shy
[22636.66s -> 22651.86s]  not to be upstaged fly for shy dropping 20 community subs 20 i want one so bad
[22654.55s -> 22662.46s]  you you stick around you you probably get one thank the both of you that's
[22663.02s -> 22671.26s]  20 subs and then like 80 something 90 something right from phylactery thank you for the enormous
[22671.26s -> 22695.18s]  sub drops something is a sign of weakness stay strong i don't know why i think that's funny
[22699.45s -> 22711.48s]  but thank you both of you again hey i don't even like taco bell gave 250 thank you
[22712.20s -> 22722.12s]  jerma can you stop doing all the best streams when i have to work i'm sorry the duality of
[22722.12s -> 22727.11s]  chat jerma why do you have to do the best streams when i work jerma why do i always
[22727.11s -> 22737.45s]  catch your worst streams that happened both of those happened tonight and you know it we
[22737.45s -> 22755.77s]  we caught it earlier that's funny just pure duality but um i don't i'm sorry that
[22756.33s -> 22762.02s]  you streams that you want to watch are conflicting with your schedule but you can watch the vod the
[22762.02s -> 22769.34s]  vod and the chat will exist for at least two months it's not the same i know it's not the same
[22769.34s -> 22777.29s]  but it's still something thank you though thank you thank you thank you i don't even like taco
[22777.29s -> 22788.28s]  bell also thank you to uh pigeon for the 250 hey jerma again i'm so fucking excited to meet and
[22788.28s -> 22793.32s]  hang out with you at twitchcon and i never really got into this game but i played this shit out of
[22793.32s -> 22800.98s]  superstar saga what are your thoughts on the mario and luigi games i did i played superstar saga but
[22800.98s -> 22814.50s]  not the other ones in the series because there is what two three more after that something like
[22814.50s -> 22821.85s]  that i did superstar saga then the dream team or something something like sleeping something
[22821.85s -> 22829.37s]  about sleeping they sleep in one of them what's the one where they sleep superstar saga
[22830.01s -> 22843.38s]  the time with the moment they sleep bowser's inside story the sleep one is the newest one oh
[22843.94s -> 22855.61s]  luigi's dream it is dream team isn't it partners in time bowser's inside story dream team and
[22855.69s -> 22868.12s]  paper jam okay so there are quite a few of them but yeah i'll be at twitchcon i'll be poking around
[22868.12s -> 22874.78s]  i have no official meeting greets or anything so i'm kind of just going to be just kind of
[22874.78s -> 22879.99s]  walking around randomly i don't really do any planned real meeting greets or anything
[22880.71s -> 22891.45s]  like we talked about it a few times i kind of just am going to exist there but i have nothing
[22891.45s -> 22897.58s]  official i'm probably going to be like in a mustache and shit i'm going to be like i'm one
[22897.58s -> 22907.80s]  of those like i like glasses and mustaches i should be like if you find me then you get like
[22907.80s -> 22921.02s]  a thumbs up i'm gonna be like glasses mustache grow beard a mustache would be part of the beard
[22921.02s -> 22928.71s]  i guess and i guess this is the part in the stream where we get a shitload of community subs because
[22928.71s -> 22948.87s]  uh your boy just gave 10 20 20 came in from fly for shy and then almost 100 came in from
[22948.87s -> 22959.29s]  file actor elitch and then 10 now from you boy oh my goodness thank you thank you for the subs
[22959.29s -> 22966.81s]  thanks for the community subs guys you shock me every fucking day i said i wasn't gonna swear
[22966.81s -> 22973.50s]  in the mario streams i forgot how am i ever gonna get that ad friendly stream it's never gonna
[22973.50s -> 22985.53s]  happen might as well just forget about it now but uh thank you thank you to uh tramston for the 10
[22985.53s -> 22992.70s]  bucks thousand bits from uh tramston mick chicken fund this is for the mick chicken fund
[22993.26s -> 23002.42s]  i mean that is good that's at least three mick chickens so and then i'm going to use them for
[23002.42s -> 23012.30s]  that i promise thank you to the ten dollars thank you gnarly for the 250 i think it would be cool
[23012.30s -> 23017.64s]  to see you play a mario rpg game without prior knowledge of it like bows is inside story a lot
[23017.64s -> 23030.06s]  of bows is inside story fans here huh there's a lot of people that say play that one play that one
[23030.06s -> 23040.28s]  play is that it's it's really good it's just a really good game okay superstar saga is the
[23040.28s -> 23048.47s]  best one geno's in superstar saga a lot of people don't know that gino is actually in that game
[23050.92s -> 23072.20s]  weirdly enough it's true inside story was the best one okay i will keep that on all that knowledge
[23072.20s -> 23081.91s]  upstairs in the brain hey game watch thanks for the 10 bucks game watch hey jeremy i would meme
[23082.79s -> 23087.99s]  but today is my two year sub anniversary i love your stuff since the first raven's cry video and
[23087.99s -> 23095.19s]  your streams are consistently the best part of my week here's to another two years raven's cry is
[23095.19s -> 23103.82s]  the best worst game i've ever played i you know sometimes you wish you could just memory wipe
[23103.82s -> 23118.79s]  yourself and do something again that first experience in raven's cry was so funny it was
[23118.87s -> 23125.88s]  so awful but somehow was still worth playing just because you needed to know what was going to
[23125.88s -> 23133.43s]  happen next you can't be on that ship with the be brave guy and not play the rest of the game
[23133.43s -> 23142.97s]  at least put another few hours in how could you do that how could you get like launched across the
[23142.97s -> 23148.33s]  map from an animal or watch like an animal throw what i think that the was wasn't there an animal
[23148.33s -> 23155.85s]  throwing rocks at people there was a guy there was a there was like a rock throwing animal that
[23155.85s -> 23167.32s]  was whipping rocks people yeah it was it was like a monkey or something right he's just throwing
[23167.32s -> 23180.46s]  rocks at i wish that company would make i wanted to make another game please do i hope they made
[23180.46s -> 23187.19s]  enough money to make another game i said i really do i truly believe that it was worth playing it
[23187.19s -> 23194.66s]  was worth it i don't care how much money it was they probably don't exist anymore though
[23194.66s -> 23201.40s]  unfortunately but thank you game watch or game watcher for the 10 bucks here's to another two
[23201.40s -> 23213.11s]  years uh erdemius erdemius thanks for the 21 dollars erdemius 21 bucks coming in from erdemius
[23213.11s -> 23217.59s]  89 hey streamer it's my 21st birthday on monday and i wanted to thank you for all the years of
[23217.59s -> 23223.35s]  top tier content i wanted to know if you had any life advice from a longtime boomer to a new one
[23225.77s -> 23235.05s]  thanks well first thank you thanks for the 21 2100 bits happy birthday on monday which is i mean i
[23235.05s -> 23241.45s]  don't know if you're eastern time or what what time zone you're in but it might be monday so
[23241.45s -> 23255.00s]  happy birthday probably maybe right now but any of any life advice hmm let me think that's pretty
[23255.00s -> 23266.92s]  open-ended question i think the best advice that just general life advice i can give is everybody
[23266.92s -> 23277.48s]  figures it out eventually some people take longer than others i took a long time to figure it out
[23277.48s -> 23287.54s]  but eventually you do figure it out for the most part drink water is a good one too
[23288.18s -> 23301.02s]  no that actually is a great piece of general advice um replace at least one or two drinks
[23301.02s -> 23321.38s]  a day with a glass of water you are going to exponentially help your entire life i'm when
[23321.38s -> 23330.94s]  i was younger i used to just drain mountain dew code reds i didn't drink water when i was younger
[23330.94s -> 23344.73s]  i didn't and it's really not good for you i have since pretty much eliminated most of and this is
[23344.73s -> 23351.05s]  this is not i'm not going to be like i don't drink soda anymore because it's bad that's what i do
[23351.85s -> 23355.18s]  i just don't drink it for every single piece of liquid that goes in my body
[23360.39s -> 23365.96s]  i kind of was one of those people for a little while i don't know why you just you just kind of
[23365.96s -> 23371.24s]  are you'd go to like restaurants and you'd sit around and people would order oh yeah what
[23371.80s -> 23375.32s]  i'm taking my you drink orders what would you what are you having i'll have a coke
[23375.32s -> 23383.59s]  i'll have a coke we'll have a coke yeah i'll take a coke i'll take a lemon tea please i don't drink
[23383.59s -> 23394.44s]  soda and everyone's like where is the guy that doesn't order the coke but then i would just be
[23394.44s -> 23400.04s]  envious like watching everybody drink their cokes and i'm like i kind of i wish i kind of wish i had
[23400.04s -> 23400.52s]  one of those
[23412.94s -> 23420.30s]  but i drink soda sometimes i'll drink soda just if you know something you just feel like it
[23421.26s -> 23432.06s]  that's fine sometimes you just want to have a soda because i feel like it go for it sometimes
[23432.06s -> 23439.18s]  you want to eat like three double cheeseburgers from burger king do it i love every second of it
[23440.06s -> 23448.28s]  just don't do it every day in fact don't do that like
[23449.08s -> 23459.46s]  once a week in fact don't ever do that you shouldn't you should go to you should go to
[23459.46s -> 23470.86s]  in and out instead they have much better burgers don't they don't go there either make them at home
[23480.58s -> 23484.90s]  this is the voice actor real stream i don't know i really am just like
[23484.90s -> 23496.12s]  oh hey i've gone through all of my range this whole stream i'm reaching for new ones too i'm
[23496.12s -> 23503.11s]  reaching out to try to find other ones you know when you got to do 50 characters you kind of have
[23503.11s -> 23512.07s]  to figure out which ones don't sound alike and that concludes my life advice but thank you
[23512.07s -> 23527.90s]  urdemius for the 21 bucks do mickey oh oh donald what are you talking i had i was close it was
[23527.90s -> 23545.14s]  really close i had it if i worked on that i could probably do it uh thank you to sai sai chan for

[23616.97s -> 23620.89s]  and i don't mind if he doesn't see these messages like i said just getting all the emotes

[23655.32s -> 23658.76s]  not much but i wanted to give you something because you helped you've helped me so much
[23660.14s -> 23670.49s]  last month here in the dc area my house burnt down oh my god i'm so sorry i fucking hear that
[23670.49s -> 23676.90s]  and uh today i found out that a co-worker that i liked has passed away i've been watching his

[23680.98s -> 23688.89s]  or stream i'm really really sorry to hear all that that sounds like a really really hard fucking time
[23693.02s -> 23698.38s]  hopefully that gets completely situated hopefully you're safe number one and anybody else that was
[23698.38s -> 23710.06s]  there whoever it was family friends hopefully you're all okay and i'm sorry um for your loss
[23710.06s -> 23716.44s]  here losing somebody that you cared about that sounds like a shitload of things to go through
[23716.44s -> 23723.48s]  in a small amount of time but thank you gray tax for the five dollars and thank you for
[23725.08s -> 23736.15s]  hanging out here i as long as well as everybody else here i'm probably very happy to cheer you up
[23736.79s -> 23746.70s]  or anybody for that matter so stay safe stay strong because that's a lot of stuff to go through
[23748.09s -> 23769.86s]  i wish you and your family the best i really do have a great day we also had community subs come
[23769.86s -> 23781.35s]  into a lot not just the ones that came in very recently here we had otter fiend 10 subs tonight
[23781.35s -> 23787.53s]  germa sucks with subs jeff with subs the fax machine with subs we touched upon them but still
[23791.22s -> 23794.66s]  it was a lot of community subs tonight i just want to make sure i touch on them again
[23797.06s -> 23811.16s]  thank you to paul manifold for the 10 dollars i like gino with a smiley thank you paul manifold
[23811.16s -> 23827.78s]  for the thousand bits the 10 dollars they say i'd like gino i do i do too that's the guy from
[23827.78s -> 23837.43s]  smash brothers um paul manifold is not in smash brothers no you're talking about gino
[23847.03s -> 23852.89s]  he's not and gino isn't either so that's equally as funny
[23853.53s -> 23871.42s]  oh you know gino is in smash as a jpg image oh i was seething i was inconsolable because it's
[23871.42s -> 23877.02s]  not even new artwork or new model it's just like the png from the back of the fucking super nintendo
[23877.02s -> 23882.95s]  box you couldn't have had any new artwork somebody could have drawn them or something commission
[23882.95s -> 23889.91s]  anything why does it have to be like the the super nintendo image from like the game informer poster
[23894.78s -> 23911.80s]  he's coping right now i am i am gino will never be in smash no he won't absolutely not it's never
[23911.80s -> 23918.94s]  gonna happen there's been almost two there's been like 15 years of people demanding that gino is a
[23918.94s -> 23926.94s]  playable character in smash brothers and it's never gonna happen they have had like three
[23926.94s -> 23934.14s]  opportunities with tons of square involvement yeah paul manifold actually is a higher contender
[23934.14s -> 23941.45s]  than gino at this point because all the every bullet point every single it all pointed to
[23941.45s -> 23955.58s]  gino was probably going to be in this game that's it unless they do a second season pass
[23956.86s -> 23962.86s]  and they just add just just fucking because they add all the characters that everybody's upset
[23962.86s -> 23967.82s]  aren't in the game they'll be okay this is the only way this is gonna happen the next few dlc
[23967.82s -> 23973.26s]  characters are gonna be big great reveals right season pass two is gonna be like the all right
[23973.26s -> 23982.90s]  everybody relax waluigi isaac from golden sun gino they're gonna do if they do that that's what's
[23982.90s -> 23995.70s]  gonna that's the only way it's gonna happen isaac is never gonna get a game you delusional idiots
[23997.27s -> 24009.75s]  well i was a little nicer with my take on that yeah that was very mean take i'm still holding
[24009.75s -> 24016.87s]  up hope the more that like somebody said earlier the more that i say it'll never happen the more
[24016.87s -> 24025.83s]  that it maybe would if no it won't no it's not gonna happen at this stage they would rather put
[24025.83s -> 24039.54s]  in anybody else it's nice to dream people said banjo would never happen and look how that turned
[24039.54s -> 24048.71s]  out yeah but but microsoft has really started to push its kind of collaborative efforts with the
[24048.71s -> 24064.01s]  other big three especially nintendo square and nintendo have a a decent relationship i guess
[24064.81s -> 24075.11s]  but banjo is one of those characters that is is such a huge beloved rare franchise from the
[24075.11s -> 24084.98s]  nintendo 64 era gino was in this game for 12 hours and then you can see him in the background
[24084.98s -> 24090.66s]  in superstar saga i think he's a great character i he's a great character he's really interesting
[24090.66s -> 24096.02s]  really cool they could have developed him a little more but banjo getting in over gino makes a lot
[24096.02s -> 24109.67s]  more sense they do have a gino me skin and it's hurting me nintendo is probably the reason why
[24109.75s -> 24114.20s]  they probably haven't done like a gino dlc or something because i have to assume
[24116.04s -> 24121.72s]  they're probably scared that they'll release something like that and like 112 people are
[24121.72s -> 24126.92s]  going to buy it because it's probably only 112 of us that actually care about this character
[24128.63s -> 24139.32s]  you could probably fit us all in an auditorium we we they could be like a gino we love gino convention
[24141.21s -> 24153.59s]  and you could fit us all on a school bus i'd be there in my gino hat in my gino shirt my
[24153.59s -> 24157.67s]  gino shorts my gino lunchbox and i'd be so fucking raring to go it'd be awesome
[24159.35s -> 24165.69s]  but way more people are going to buy the banjo dlc and i know they have the pass right but i'm
[24165.69s -> 24171.80s]  talking about like in years prior as well i don't know did they even do a pass for the wii you want
[24171.80s -> 24190.70s]  to did you buy could you buy them solo you're underestimating the size i'm just i'm i'm just
[24190.70s -> 24196.34s]  i'm taking the piss right now my point is there's a lot fewer people that even know who this person
[24196.34s -> 24213.58s]  is versus some of the more currently relevant nintendo or not characters i do love it i think
[24213.58s -> 24217.42s]  it's a great character i think malo is a great character i think croco is a great character i
[24217.42s -> 24223.74s]  think some characters you haven't even seen yet are great characters too is sans gonna be in smash
[24225.58s -> 24248.65s]  i don't i don't think so no i mean i i don't think that would happen he said no so he wants
[24248.65s -> 24261.67s]  him in he has insider information nobody tells me anything i don't know shit i am the least
[24261.67s -> 24274.76s]  informed person that you probably watch on twitch at least in regard i mean like in regards to like
[24274.76s -> 24284.18s]  video game stuff like no no no no i'm talking no i'm not talking about like video game related
[24284.18s -> 24287.70s]  news and information this is not i don't have any of that
[24305.14s -> 24309.56s]  all right but uh thank you paul manor for it for the 10 dollars i really do love gino as well
[24311.82s -> 24315.58s]  uh i look forward i look forward to maining you in uh smash brothers switch 2
[24318.22s -> 24322.30s]  hey airless thanks for the 250 jeremy elberton is my favorite broadcaster i think he's all right
[24326.81s -> 24331.61s]  jeff putus thanks for the 250 hey germa can you wish my good friend daphne a happy 23rd birthday
[24331.61s -> 24345.27s]  yes absolutely happy birthday daphne have a good 23rd birthday jeff says hello happy birthday
[24345.27s -> 24352.38s]  make it a good one wait isn't pluto a planet again remember when everyone laughed at me
[24352.38s -> 24357.18s]  and talked shit to me and called me all kinds of names when i said that that was gonna happen
[24357.90s -> 24381.40s]  everybody remember that everybody remember that happening i do uh one day ago nasa boss
[24382.20s -> 24396.74s]  jokingly declares pluto a planet no no no this is the real one is pluto a planet nasa administrator
[24397.54s -> 24411.80s]  a nasa administrator may reignite the argument hold on i'm gonna read this whole fucking thing
[24412.60s -> 24421.78s]  strap in for this one in 2006 the international astronomical union caused consternation when
[24421.78s -> 24427.14s]  it declared that pluto was no longer a planet several bodies of similar size had been found
[24427.14s -> 24433.38s]  in the cupra belt so the iau created a definition that included the criterion that a planet must
[24433.38s -> 24439.38s]  clear the neighborhood around its orbit which pluto does not pluto was reclassified as a
[24439.38s -> 24448.71s]  dwarf planet a dwarf planet a dwarf planet in a move which upset anyone who grew up learning
[24448.71s -> 24460.66s]  about a solar system consisting of nine planets now nasa administrator jim brutenstein has
[24460.66s -> 24465.94s]  reignited the fierce debate of a pluto status by unexpectedly coming out in favor of it being a
[24465.94s -> 24475.58s]  planet just so you know in my view pluto is a planet he said in a tongue-in-cheek clip posted
[24475.58s -> 24482.07s]  to twitter you can write that the nasa administrator declared pluto a planet once again i'm sticking by
[24482.07s -> 24499.96s]  that it's the way i learned it i'm committed to it sorry link the article just type just
[24499.96s -> 24504.84s]  uh you know how easy this article is to find just type in pluto planet is in fucking google
[24505.64s -> 24520.66s]  it's everywhere you got it guys there's a debate right now between is pluto a planet or not
[24524.04s -> 24528.36s]  a dwarf planet is a dwarf okay hold on is it remember when i said pluto is a planet and
[24528.36s -> 24533.24s]  everyone's like it's not a planet what is it what does it come at what comes after dwarf
[24533.96s -> 24541.05s]  it starts with a p i don't know what that what is it what's the word it comes after dwarf p
[24541.05s -> 24548.97s]  something it's a land lanet planet a planet a dwarf planet but it's not a planet though but
[24548.97s -> 24557.64s]  it just gets called a dwarf planet so what is it then a broadcaster oh fuck off that's that's
[24557.64s -> 24574.31s]  purge worthy that's purge worthy for me that's it that's purge worthy the dwarf planet it's a
[24574.31s -> 24593.94s]  planet all the moons are jupiter of jupiter are planets too no because they're moons they're not

[24920.65s -> 24924.81s]  when i play the game i get lost in a phase then i find out i'm stuck in geno's maze
[24927.10s -> 24937.59s]  it is tough especially when you don't know what you're doing but i do i do and they say i don't
[24937.59s -> 24941.35s]  know about you but i would love to see an hd remaster of this game not to say the original
[24941.35s -> 24946.23s]  isn't awesome but seeing these graphics in full hd would be amazing especially if the original
[24946.23s -> 24959.53s]  renders were used i would love that and i would also love a actual super mario rpg too that would
[24959.53s -> 24971.99s]  be great they were going to do it but they canned it i don't know why problems for some reason but
[24971.99s -> 24975.27s]  let's get the credits rolling we only have a few more bits to do so let's get those credits on
[24975.27s -> 24983.34s]  screen this is going to be a lot of subs on this list considering the amount of community subs

[25001.82s -> 25006.62s]  did the carnival that was just a joke i was making because they said like if you're good then you get
[25006.62s -> 25016.38s]  something special and i said that like yesterday so i did it last night i did and i'm incredibly
[25016.38s -> 25029.48s]  excited for it i'm almost cannot contain myself did the carnival stream happen though it's happening
[25029.48s -> 25038.41s]  on the 21st of september so in just about three weeks is everyone going to be the same or subs
[25038.41s -> 25042.73s]  going to have access to special stuff everyone is going to be on the same playing field completely
[25043.53s -> 25064.26s]  but we had uh we had 10 dollars from ahahua ahahua ahahua i think i'm saying that right it's ahahua
[25066.95s -> 25072.78s]  i'm doing it right thank you for the 10 bucks they say best streamer been watching for seven

[25094.49s -> 25104.41s]  the 10 bucks even live for seven hours you should have consumed a bunch of water yeah i've refilled
[25104.41s -> 25112.46s]  it a few times i'm good but thank you for the 10 bucks appreciate it all of you thanks for 250 can
[25112.46s -> 25118.94s]  i get an f in the chat for my frogs that died recently no idea how or why and my week is ruined
[25118.94s -> 25132.41s]  i'm really sorry to hear that rest in peace to your frogs i'm sure they were great great great
[25133.13s -> 25147.99s]  pets i love frogs i love frogs of toads back in massachusetts when it was a lot it was a lot
[25147.99s -> 25155.34s]  wetter they were frogs and toads everywhere just randomly in the grass every time you'd see a toad
[25155.34s -> 25161.83s]  or frog it would just be like oh yes and walk over and just look at them and they would just be
[25161.83s -> 25174.09s]  staring up just like hanging out they're cute and they eat a shitload of bugs so they're awesome
[25176.33s -> 25181.93s]  the amount of frog the amount of bugs that the mosquitoes and flies that frogs and toads eat
[25184.25s -> 25191.21s]  they're helping you out they're taking care of you you just don't know it but thank you all mew and
[25191.21s -> 25204.23s]  again i'm really sorry to hear about your frogs take care thank you oh chase for the 10 dollars
[25204.23s -> 25218.17s]  love you germ can i pm you i do not have open pms i don't unless i'm in the discord and i do
[25218.17s -> 25226.42s]  this because i found over the years that it's impossible to keep up with i used to have like
[25226.42s -> 25232.90s]  steam friends and steam open and it can i could be added but it's just it's i'll be honest it's
[25232.90s -> 25241.74s]  just kind of too much for me to handle and when i actually am streaming and i actually and after
[25241.74s -> 25250.06s]  the streams and before streams i would rather focus on making content making streams hanging out
[25251.74s -> 25257.34s]  i don't really have a whole lot of time to have like open pms and just kind of talk to people
[25258.14s -> 25263.72s]  i do show up in the discord all the time or in pre-stream chat i'll hang out here for a couple
[25263.72s -> 25274.25s]  hours i was here um two days ago i was in the chat for about two three hours just hanging out
[25274.25s -> 25280.82s]  when i wasn't feeling good but if there is something that you want to get across to me
[25282.68s -> 25288.18s]  i you and it's something important right and i would put i would say important as in you know
[25288.18s -> 25294.58s]  use your you know common sense and due diligence to know what like would be important um then there
[25294.58s -> 25309.85s]  are mods that you could ping in pm and they can get the messages to me but it also kind of that
[25309.85s -> 25315.93s]  same type of uh way of thinking the same reason why i don't do um like reading bits and subs on
[25315.93s -> 25321.75s]  stream anymore i mean obviously we hang out for like an hour or so at the end of streams
[25323.26s -> 25328.06s]  but when i'm like in when i'm in like the mode to stream and hang out and talk and do all this stuff
[25328.06s -> 25353.94s]  that's what i want to do so you don't have any nudes nudes uh no but no i don't the to kind of
[25353.94s -> 25360.02s]  end that whole thing i don't do like open pms i don't really i the only way that i really reach
[25360.02s -> 25367.48s]  out to like the collective community is through discord and hanging out in the general or in
[25367.48s -> 25371.96s]  pre-stream unless if you want if you need to ping a mod about something that's something that you
[25371.96s -> 25376.38s]  think is important then we could figure it out but thank you do appreciate it thank you for the
[25376.38s -> 25386.58s]  ten dollars thank you thank you thank you do i yeah do i browse my own subreddit i do not all
[25386.58s -> 25396.55s]  the time but i do check in from time to time to see what what they're doing over there i check
[25398.65s -> 25401.93s]  you know sometimes i just want to know you need to know what people are saying
[25406.07s -> 25418.76s]  he needs when he needs an ego boost no uh thank you snoozing coffin for the 250 hey i'm going to
[25418.76s -> 25423.24s]  dallas for a month it's pretty exciting because it'll be the longest time i'll be on my own
[25423.24s -> 25430.52s]  pretty much i've only been on a plane twice i'm still anxious about planes you fly a lot now don't
[25430.52s -> 25434.84s]  you to la or california and back how do you deal with that were you never scared about it or did
[25434.84s -> 25440.84s]  you just normalize it with time and it will be exciting in a different time zone closer to the
[25440.84s -> 25448.55s]  normal stream times too i've flown on enough planes where it's just it's it's just a car
[25448.55s -> 25464.55s]  that goes in the air it's a very loud car yes flying flying used to make me nervous until i
[25465.11s -> 25474.31s]  realized and i thought about there are people that fly three four five six plus times a week
[25474.87s -> 25483.18s]  every week and they just kind of get on and get off get on get off go about their regular day
[25486.57s -> 25491.05s]  so the one time that i would be flying be like gosh i really don't want to get on a plane there's
[25491.05s -> 25496.17s]  a guy walking by me with a briefcase that that's his like six is sixth or seventh plane ride today
[25497.14s -> 25507.13s]  and i'm just like oh why is he seems like he's everything everything's cool all right this yeah
[25507.13s -> 25515.14s]  this is easy then the one thing i can't do is i can't sleep on planes no matter how much i try
[25515.14s -> 25519.86s]  does i could be the most exhausted in my entire life i could stay awake for two or three straight
[25519.86s -> 25532.10s]  days and i would not be able to sleep on the plane those are actors the guy walking around
[25532.10s -> 25536.58s]  with the briefcase in the airport is not he's just doing that because he wants people to think he's
[25536.58s -> 25543.35s]  a businessman that's what he does on his days off he just i'm gonna okay it's my day off
[25543.99s -> 25550.15s]  i'm gonna put a bunch of blank computer paper in a briefcase and like shuffle the papers around at
[25550.15s -> 25557.02s]  the terminal and like check my watch open up a laptop and look at it close it and then i
[25559.19s -> 25565.98s]  feels pretty good no they get paid to do that no why would anybody be paid to do that
[25572.92s -> 25581.40s]  he's honored by the airport to just be a guy how many of these guys are there they what they just
[25581.40s -> 25587.86s]  have like a hundred fake business people having an illusion of people traveling it's so people
[25588.42s -> 25601.35s]  like you don't get scared by planes so what about the people on the plane
[25602.87s -> 25607.19s]  if there's like two or three hundred people on that plane is like only four people that actually
[25607.19s -> 25633.13s]  bought a ticket first class is a scam to make you think you're getting a good a cheap ticket
[25635.42s -> 25641.37s]  so what all the people in first class it's not real and they're like oh those are like a thousand
[25641.37s -> 25648.38s]  dollars a seat but they're not actually used so oh good thing i'm not sitting that has two more
[25648.38s -> 25663.32s]  crazy mine was only 342 what a shitty fucking imagine having to like imagine having to sit
[25663.32s -> 25669.82s]  on an airplane and you're not even working you're not doing anything like flight attendants for
[25669.82s -> 25675.90s]  instance right they fly every day multiple times a day but they are they're they're they're working
[25676.86s -> 25682.14s]  they are at the drinks talking to passengers they're doing through safety protocols they're
[25682.14s -> 25687.42s]  in contact with the work crews in the luggage imagine if like you just sat in the seat and you
[25687.42s -> 25700.28s]  didn't you didn't do anything i would not be able to do that job what about an air marshal you have
[25700.28s -> 25707.98s]  an air marshal has like a specific they're like a specific task they're like security your job
[25708.06s -> 25716.41s]  is to just be on the airplane with an ipad in your hand i think i would lose my mind
[25721.08s -> 25731.02s]  you just get to watch movies on the airplane but yeah but you but that's just bring a d i guess
[25731.02s -> 25740.50s]  you could just bring a ds and just play the ds or like warcraft or something but but then the the
[25740.50s -> 25748.46s]  jig is up because wouldn't everybody do that if you were a career pretend in the airplane actor
[25749.18s -> 25753.72s]  they're all gonna have wow accounts and you're gonna look around as the one person that bought
[25753.72s -> 25757.80s]  the ticket and it's gonna be like 60 laptops people are gonna be playing wow in the same server
[25757.80s -> 25762.20s]  you're gonna know who that you you're sitting next to you're gonna have your own like in crew wow
[25762.20s -> 25774.22s]  server it's gonna look strange when you're like wait a minute i just want to get to go to the
[25774.22s -> 25780.54s]  bathroom and all these people in this strange all these people on this plane are in the same
[25780.62s -> 25788.17s]  molten core raid that's kind of odd is it is there a gaming convention going on
[25788.17s -> 25800.54s]  like where i'm going i've played mario kart ds multiplayer on airplanes with people well we
[25800.54s -> 25817.50s]  found the actor how is it is it fun all right all right all right but no planes i i take i take
[25817.50s -> 25827.82s]  planes all the time they can be stressful when they're long and when you can't really sleep
[25828.81s -> 25839.42s]  but you do get to go across ridiculous amounts of land and sea like five thousand times faster
[25839.42s -> 25844.54s]  than you would normally so it's kind of it's it's worth it to you know gotta go through security
[25844.54s -> 25849.18s]  you gotta go do all this you gotta sit on the plane who are you sitting with do you how big is
[25849.18s -> 25856.38s]  your seat oh fuck i'm like gotta go to the bathroom however long it is usually i anything less than
[25856.38s -> 25862.23s]  like three to six hours for me is i can completely handle totally fine i just wish i could sleep
[25865.75s -> 25868.87s]  they just changed the sets outside the airplane and it takes a couple hours
[25869.51s -> 25876.07s]  so what you're adding on top of this saying that you're not actually leaving the plane what does
[25876.07s -> 25880.31s]  plane take you so everyone gets in there there's like 150 actors and there's three people that
[25880.31s -> 25889.43s]  bought a ticket and they put up a gremlins to pretend outside scenery they make some noise
[25891.56s -> 25898.57s]  and then but how do you explain where you end up is that just down the street is that like the
[25898.57s -> 25910.15s]  truman show where we have like two miles of actual livable earth the entire the entire airport is
[25910.15s -> 25925.18s]  moving like a floating disk island you never wonder why all the trees look the same that is true why
[25925.18s -> 25930.46s]  the fuck do all trees look why are all trees the same you might be on to something here
[25932.09s -> 25941.37s]  you just go on an elevator so wait you got like seven layers of hell you just go in an elevator
[25941.37s -> 25952.06s]  you go to like layer one and that's like what like simpson addy layer two is like i don't know boston
[25952.06s -> 25976.12s]  new york layer three which is like in different layers of the crust just different classic wow
[25976.12s -> 25997.48s]  layers i love this it's so stupid all right let's get out here birds aren't real either
[26000.86s -> 26007.06s]  all right i'm done oh we gotta move on i'm going to bed thank you wolfgang for the five dollars

[26036.17s -> 26040.78s]  to do a mickey mouse impression they're going to go i don't think i can do that
[26041.90s -> 26047.82s]  i'm not sure and you go no no no just give it a try they're always going to end whatever they say
[26047.82s -> 26070.10s]  with donald donald donald and they always start with a laugh yeah they always go like

[26098.10s -> 26102.66s]  use to refill jugs for really cheap that also saves on plastic from not using water bottles
