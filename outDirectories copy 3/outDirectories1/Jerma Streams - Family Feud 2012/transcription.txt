[0.82s -> 16.54s]  Alright, have you guys decided on, let's see, potential elimination? Or do we just do Xbox?
[16.54s -> 23.77s]  I feel like 150 people would like to choose between these two.
[24.49s -> 44.33s]  So we could eliminate Tier List. Let's do another one. Because I could Tier List either way.
[44.33s -> 79.90s]  Alright, here we go. Add a neither option? Neither. Well then it's like, alright,
[79.90s -> 97.13s]  I'll see you later. Again, we're at the stage where it is so, it is too close that
[98.18s -> 101.54s]  streamer might, streamer, which is me, might just have to pick one of these.
[105.98s -> 147.85s]  262 to 262? 268 to 264? It's too split. Alright, here we go. I didn't vote? Well vote!
[147.85s -> 154.14s]  This is the only opportunity you're gonna get. Do both? Both of these things will take
[156.98s -> 165.43s]  more time than I would like to stay streaming. If I did both. Alright, we're getting close to
[165.43s -> 171.61s]  where I'm gonna have to turn this down here. Turn this off. People now, oh, every, all I had
[171.61s -> 191.22s]  to say was let's go. It's still too close to call. Looks like it's pulling away a little bit. It's
[191.22s -> 201.86s]  pulling away. It's pulling out. I'm gonna have to do it. Oh, it's, oh, we got about, if you haven't
[201.86s -> 212.82s]  voted, this is your last opportunity. I'm gonna count from 10, starting right now. 10, 9, 8,
[214.06s -> 218.47s]  wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. People need to have the poll again.
[221.96s -> 243.03s]  Okay, just in case. This is it. Go do it. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Thank you for voting.
[243.03s -> 249.94s]  Family Feud is won. We're gonna play Family Feud for a couple of hours. On the Xbox. So Family
[249.94s -> 259.72s]  Feud wins anyways. It's close though. Family Feud coming up. Uh, let me just set it up real quick.
[259.72s -> 264.04s]  I'll be a minute or two because I don't have my Xbox plugged in or anything. So give me, uh,
[264.76s -> 379.56s]  give me like a minute, give me like two minutes. I'll be right back. All right. Did it work?
[380.84s -> 392.81s]  Let's see. Where's my Xbox controller? That would be useful. That'd be nice if I actually had it.
[398.65s -> 420.58s]  I didn't shred this game, right? No. Stay mad. TT tears. Hey, a true champion does not brag about
[420.58s -> 430.09s]  his win. A true champion does a shitload of interviews and is respected around the goddamn
[430.09s -> 440.25s]  world, which is essentially kind of the same thing. A true champion does not talk shit.
[440.25s -> 467.03s]  I got a hopeless fucking captured. Hey, it did. Okay. Uh, all right. Hold on. I gotta change this
[467.03s -> 488.90s]  thing. I gotta change things to take disclaimer, everybody, just in case. Family Feud. I have to do
[488.90s -> 504.50s]  this though, because I'm going to be coming in. Hopefully that's enough of a delay. Yeah, this is
[504.50s -> 518.23s]  2012 Family Feud. We don't have any, but this is not a recent one. Change the title of the stream.
[519.77s -> 533.14s]  Family Feud 2012. Are you on the Twitch list? I wonder. I am going to do myself a favor here
[533.14s -> 539.14s]  and I am going to unplug the fucking connect because I just saw a like that's so Raven vision
[539.14s -> 557.58s]  of me sitting here with no clothes on. So I, I'm going to make sure that don't happen.
[557.58s -> 568.84s]  All right. We'll get my headphones in the burnout camera. The only difference this time is I, I
[568.84s -> 586.68s]  don't have a bathroom on. All right. I've updated the stream. All right. Who's ready to go find this
[587.48s -> 597.58s]  spy. You know what I love the most about anything is when monitors have touch-based fucking controls
[597.58s -> 614.79s]  on them that don't work like 60% of the time. I love that so much. I love it. I'm using the
[614.79s -> 622.46s]  Xbox. That's not the right controller. What, what happened to the other one? All right, let's go.
[622.46s -> 633.78s]  Ow. Let's do it. 2012 Family Feud. I want to do a test to make sure I've synced everything up.
[634.34s -> 647.11s]  You guys are going to have to help me here. I'm not going to play David. David sucks.
[647.99s -> 652.65s]  You're doing that thing where you can make me sit and look like I think David sucks.
[665.34s -> 679.67s]  Okay. You ready? Two, three, one, two, one, two, one, two, three, four. Boomer avatar. What are we
[679.67s -> 689.59s]  talking about? How are we doing? Good. Challenge. Beach party, high seas, rock and roll, fiesta.
[690.63s -> 703.51s]  Beach party. Medium. I pick the, do I have to pick my family? I have to, I'm assimilating myself
[703.51s -> 726.82s]  into another family. Who's the host? No host. No licensing fee for a host. I'm the only one in the
[726.82s -> 739.66s]  family. I, it's just me. Where's my whole family? Oh shit. Our flights got all fucked up, but they
[739.66s -> 748.97s]  still had to tape the show. Your score points for every top answer you give for these surveys.
[750.42s -> 756.10s]  If you give me an answer that's not on the board, I'll give you a strike. When you have three
[756.10s -> 762.66s]  strikes, the other family can try to steal your points. The family with a top score after four
[762.66s -> 767.14s]  rounds gets to play for a twenty thousand dollar prize. How do we do that with just me though?
[771.90s -> 788.20s]  The Kelps versus Tended D Rangoon's family. I guess I'll do it. Why do I have my avatar?
[789.32s -> 794.57s]  Answers on the board. The best answer gives you control of the board.
[794.57s -> 803.37s]  And how it works. In the buzzer to answer. We asked 100 people, name someone who might knock
[803.37s -> 820.46s]  on your hotel room door. Cleaning person. Quick answer. Clean. A clergyman.
[821.34s -> 827.66s]  Like that answer. A clergyman is going to come knock on your door.
[827.66s -> 834.71s]  It fills in the blank. It's like an auto correct.
[836.95s -> 848.33s]  All right, who could knock on the door? I think I'm going to play it. Yep. We're talking about
[848.33s -> 860.66s]  security. Room service. Pizza guy. All right, who might knock on the hotel room door?
[860.66s -> 878.58s]  We're talking about a security. A secretary of defense. What?
[882.82s -> 890.38s]  How could security? Okay, room service is another day on the one I was going to say.
[893.69s -> 902.87s]  Roofer. Room service. All right, some tiny answer. I don't know what it's going to be though.
[904.33s -> 918.33s]  One strike. Knock on your door. The front desk? Delivery? Like a delivery, right?
[927.50s -> 940.02s]  All right, that's... Plumber? Why would a plumber? Pizza? Wouldn't pizza be delivery? Like pizza
[940.02s -> 963.46s]  delivery delivery? Repair? Like maintenance. Why am I not getting an answer here? Repair guy.
[964.82s -> 974.33s]  See that answer. God. That's three strikes. There's a chance for a steal.
[975.61s -> 983.32s]  You can steal all those points just by giving me an answer on the board. I'll repeat the question
[983.32s -> 993.19s]  for you. So what is it then? I think pizza delivery person. Is that answer on the board?
[996.15s -> 1005.50s]  I said delivery. I win, motherfuckers. Your family wins the round.
[1007.85s -> 1022.02s]  Why Beach Party? Bellboy. All right. The manager. Those two out of a hundred are the ones that got
[1022.02s -> 1029.86s]  complained on. I would think it would be more than two percent of people that had their radios too
[1029.86s -> 1043.59s]  loud in their hotel room. Six answers. Give the best answer and take charge of the board.
[1043.59s -> 1051.56s]  Buzz in to answer. Here's the question. We are your family. According to women,
[1051.56s -> 1057.72s]  what is the most beautiful thing you have? What do you mean you have? What do you mean you have?
[1057.72s -> 1071.48s]  Like me? You're in a hurry. You have. Kids. I like that answer. Let's check the board.
[1074.68s -> 1080.44s]  Kids, number one. The most beautiful thing that you have are kids. It's your choice.
[1082.62s -> 1089.50s]  I mean, I was going to say. Do you want to play or pass? 2018 Lamborghini Porsche.
[1090.46s -> 1093.50s]  That thing's fucking, that's a beautiful car. You'll let the other family take it from here.
[1093.50s -> 1105.06s]  I have no idea what these answers are. Oh, okay. What is the most beautiful thing you have?
[1107.14s -> 1127.75s]  I'd say dog. A dog. A dog. Dogs. Pets. All right. You got a beautiful dog. Okay. House? I'm just
[1127.75s -> 1131.43s]  trying to think of what people would say. Oh, you've got a beautiful home. You've got a beautiful
[1131.43s -> 1144.04s]  house. You've got a beautiful house key. Houses? Houses. You've got a beautiful kids. You've got
[1144.04s -> 1163.32s]  a beautiful home. You've got a beautiful dog. You've got a beautiful life? Car? Yard. You've
[1163.32s -> 1175.46s]  got a beautiful yard. Why can't I just do yard? Why does it have to be yard stick? You have a
[1175.46s -> 1184.36s]  beautiful, I was going to say smile. Beautiful smile. Look at you. What nice teeth. Two strikes
[1184.36s -> 1196.68s]  now. What nice teeth you have. What beautiful teeth you have. What's the werewolf grandmother?
[1196.68s -> 1202.44s]  What'd she say? Beautiful what? Beautiful eyes. My, what beautiful eyes you have. My, what beautiful
[1202.44s -> 1222.41s]  teeth you have, right? All the better to see you with. All the better to, okay, what is the most
[1222.41s -> 1236.18s]  beautiful thing you have? A ring? Hair. That's a good one. Hair. Your beautiful health insurance.
[1237.14s -> 1251.69s]  Good answer. Smile. And then I have no idea what one person said. No, it's not smile. I can't even
[1251.69s -> 1265.74s]  get it wrong. Muscles? Skin? Teeth? Did we do teeth? What beautiful, beautiful teeth.
[1272.06s -> 1279.16s]  Show me the answer. What? The board has it.
[1280.04s -> 1287.08s]  Only one answer left. Beautiful teething ring. That's considered jewelry. What's the last one?
[1288.58s -> 1299.58s]  Oh wow, everything like that. Your molars are coming in really good, Nancy. Beautiful clothes?
[1303.48s -> 1312.22s]  Clones? Cloth? Oh shit, I'm gonna run out of time. Clothes for the gym. Fuck, I didn't press A.
[1312.94s -> 1325.45s]  Time for the steal. Teething ring. They're not gonna get it. The points are yours for the taking.
[1325.45s -> 1333.14s]  Just give me an answer from the board. We're talking about. All right, there's no way.
[1333.14s -> 1339.86s]  There's only two people that said anything. One person. Dresses. Does that steal the points? I
[1339.86s -> 1345.78s]  don't know why you went cross-eyed. Nope. I'll take it. No, the other family keeps the points.
[1345.78s -> 1357.24s]  The other family wins the round. What are the other answers? It's less than three.
[1358.34s -> 1364.10s]  This was answer number six. Shoes. We're doubling the score for round three.
[1366.02s -> 1376.89s]  Let's keep this going. I need one player from each team. These animations are weird. It's
[1376.89s -> 1381.77s]  almost like they overly mo-capped them or something. The top five answers are on the board.
[1382.73s -> 1385.85s]  This is the type of way you're supposed to perform on a stage for a play.
[1387.13s -> 1390.01s]  You're supposed to over-annunciate, over-act so people can see you.
[1390.01s -> 1395.90s]  We asked 100 people if you hired a gourmet chef to cook for you,
[1395.90s -> 1398.22s]  name a complaint he might have about your kitchen.
[1399.56s -> 1419.16s]  No, you shitty olive oil. You're too small. Like that answer. Let's see. There it is. Number one.
[1419.16s -> 1427.80s]  That's the number one answer. Not enough tools, not enough ingredients. They're not fresh. You have
[1427.80s -> 1436.15s]  like frozen ground beef in the freezer. You have your pantries just full of the same brand of
[1436.15s -> 1443.13s]  spaghetti and it was like the get 10 for $10 spaghetti deal. I don't know if I want to do
[1443.13s -> 1462.58s]  this one. You're going to pass. They're not going to get it. A microwave. Is that on the board?
[1464.65s -> 1475.27s]  Nope. Because a lot of places use them. I got to be ready for a steel though. I'm going to say
[1475.27s -> 1482.39s]  ingredients. Counter space. I said small. Did I pick easy? This is medium, right? What do you mean
[1482.39s -> 1496.15s]  counter space? Because the counter space is small. What will complain? The light? It's too dark in
[1496.15s -> 1507.43s]  here? Holy shit, that was a dumb answer. Okay, the knives. Ingredients. Your tools. Your utensils
[1507.43s -> 1518.63s]  are bad. Your ingredients are bad. That's going to be tools. It's dirty. Dirty. Yeah, I think dirty.
[1520.15s -> 1528.42s]  Now you have to watch out. Fuck. Stole that. Show us the answer.
[1530.30s -> 1538.47s]  Dammit. All right, what's the one that one or two people said? Fill in the blank. Ingredients. It
[1538.47s -> 1544.38s]  has to be. Like low quality. It's warm in here. All right, this is the opportunity. What is it?
[1546.26s -> 1553.14s]  Rats and pests? No. That's your third strike. Oh shit. Okay, what is it? It's ingredients.
[1553.94s -> 1561.08s]  You can steal all those points just by giving me an answer. Low quality. Not fresh.
[1565.74s -> 1593.59s]  Ingredients. No. Quality. Frozen. No. Oh no. It smells in there. Spices. Is that answer on the board?
[1597.56s -> 1606.17s]  The other family keeps the points. Fine, we have our winner for the round.
[1607.69s -> 1614.47s]  The other answers are? You know, I really would like this if you didn't,
[1614.47s -> 1618.31s]  if you would just stop spitting in the food. Each answer is worth triple.
[1619.11s -> 1630.62s]  Let's keep this going. I need one. Stove. I don't like your stove. Isn't counter space in small?
[1630.62s -> 1638.30s]  All right, I got to do this. The top five answers are on the board. Give the best answer and take
[1638.30s -> 1644.62s]  charge of the board. The stove is a stove. They're all the same damn thing. Here's the question.
[1646.73s -> 1653.21s]  Name a word or phrase that begins with the word string. Cheese. Don't let me stop you. String
[1653.21s -> 1668.71s]  cheese. String theory. I'll get all these. Sounds good to me. I'll take that. String.
[1673.66s -> 1681.03s]  String theory. String. It's your choice. I don't know other than two of these. Do you want to play
[1681.03s -> 1701.18s]  or pass? String bean. String bean. Let's keep going. I'm going to string theory because I said
[1701.18s -> 1713.74s]  that immediately. Is it up there? Why is it funny? I don't know. The word string bean is funny. I
[1713.74s -> 1728.86s]  don't know why. It is. Excellent. There are no strikes on the board. String beans. Did that just
[1728.86s -> 1744.47s]  say string bingus? String cheese. String cheese. String. Like a violin. String violin. String
[1744.47s -> 1774.10s]  instrument. All right, what is this last one? String. Guitar. String. String quartet. That's
[1774.10s -> 1801.67s]  not a bad idea. Thank you, family. Is that right? Uh oh. That's strike one. String bikini. Is it on
[1801.67s -> 1812.58s]  the board? Uh oh. Guys. That's strike two. String bikini. String quartet. String instrument. String.

[1825.74s -> 1847.08s]  String section. String along. Is that right? Oh. Good job, family. Clear the board. Show me the
[1847.08s -> 1853.29s]  link team. And that's how you win. That's how you decimate. You're moving on. That's how you just
[1853.29s -> 1859.78s]  absolutely fucking decimate, guys. Thanks for playing. Better luck next time. It's time for
[1859.78s -> 1868.09s]  Fast Money. Against me. Do I get to play with him? That was a pretty sick karate move.
[1868.89s -> 1872.09s]  That was a good like martial art move. I just did like a spin kick.
[1875.93s -> 1881.93s]  You have five surveys to answer but not much time. You have two chances to answer each question.
[1881.93s -> 1887.53s]  Chances. We'll add the scores together and give you fast money bonus if you have at least 200
[1887.53s -> 1895.82s]  points. Okay. The clock starts when I read the question. Name something a gardener uses that
