[1.21s -> 8.86s]  Little early, huh? Do you guys think it's funny that the last, probably two or three streams,
[8.86s -> 15.32s]  I've said? Yeah, it's gonna be starting around noon. Oh, just kidding. It's starting at 9 30 a.m. Pacific
[15.32s -> 24.55s]  time. How do you think that's funny? You know what I mean? It's click baiting. Am I? What did I do?
[24.55s -> 37.99s]  The title is, finishing in the top 10 is a win for me. That's just a fact. That's just me telling you
[37.99s -> 48.26s]  what's gonna happen. Finishing in 11th place is second place. Finishing in 12th place is
[48.26s -> 53.08s]  third place. Make sure you remember that for this stream because that's going to happen quite a few
[53.08s -> 61.88s]  times. You're a loser. That's not a loser. That's winning in your own world. That's called winning
[61.88s -> 73.11s]  in your own world. He's settling. All right, whatever you want. Whatever you want to call it.
[73.67s -> 88.39s]  I'm winning in my own world. That's a loser talk. No, it's not. As long as I make my rules.
[89.56s -> 96.76s]  Look, if I come in 13th or 14th place, sure, I lost. I didn't win. I come in 12th place. That's
[96.76s -> 117.43s]  third place. All right, you ready? What about 40th? How many people are in this game? How many people?
[117.43s -> 125.13s]  How many players are there? 60? All right, is this game any good? Be real with me. I've seen a lot of
[125.13s -> 129.53s]  people have been playing it. I've seen a ton of people playing it. I feel like people like it.
[134.65s -> 142.94s]  It's pretty average. Well, here let's let's go ahead and take a look. Does this mean that I'm the
[142.94s -> 149.66s]  does this mean I'm the 8300 and second fall guy? Does that mean that I'm the 8300 person to install
[149.66s -> 161.75s]  the game? How does that work? Or do I have to get that higher and be that's my ranking? This is a
[161.75s -> 168.22s]  tuber game? Well, whatever. I'm an ex tuber. I think I'm allowed to be a tuber sometimes.
[168.78s -> 181.86s]  I thought you were going to play this with stir. It's a little early for stir though. I think he
[181.86s -> 187.45s]  has something to do today, but I wanted to play it. Look, don't you guys know with all tuber games,
[187.45s -> 192.89s]  you've got to strike while the iron's hot. Otherwise, don't do it. If I don't play this
[192.89s -> 198.90s]  game now, you think I'm going to play it in like six months? No, I got I've got to jump on. I've
[198.90s -> 204.36s]  got to get on the ride. Let me get on the ride. I don't care that I'm sitting all the way in the
[204.36s -> 209.66s]  back of the roller coaster. I mean, that sucks. I want to be up in the front, but I wasn't there.
[209.66s -> 213.66s]  So I have to take my seat all at the last spot of the roller coaster, but I'm not going to be
[213.66s -> 222.76s]  able to see the big drop. Whatever. Okay. So if I press A right now, you guys are all going to
[222.76s -> 230.70s]  press A at the same time, right? That's how this works, right? Like you wait for me to press A and
[230.70s -> 241.16s]  then everybody presses A. Okay, here we go. I'm going to press A now. Oh, some of you got
[241.16s -> 247.50s]  fucked up there. I'm going to press A right now. Sorry, some of you got messed up. Do a countdown.
[247.50s -> 260.34s]  Sure. Wait, hold on. This outfits. I like the blue, uh, common kind of like the sprinkles.
[260.34s -> 266.31s]  Well, I like, I know lightning bolt face. I'm not putting that on people that this is the gibbous
[266.31s -> 275.37s]  of this game. I'm not going to wear it. People will know I'm new. I'm putting on the bird feet
[275.37s -> 291.06s]  though. That's important. Okay, cool. Yeah, let's go. Theatrics. Oh, this is a D pad. Oh, I don't
[291.06s -> 299.96s]  have anything celebrations. All right. What does this mean? Season one ways to buy stuff. Oh,
[299.96s -> 310.55s]  this is a buy things game. Oh, it's a buy things game. Is it? No, it's not. Right? Yeah. Oh, it's
[310.55s -> 315.62s]  pretty generous. All right. Cool. All right. I'm just gonna, I don't have no idea what the fuck's
[315.62s -> 319.78s]  going on. I only know there's like a hundred people don't lose. I guess. I don't know anything about
[319.78s -> 329.66s]  this game. You ready? Three, two, one, better press it. Ah, it's too bad. You were coming for me.
[329.66s -> 337.88s]  How about now? Oh, wait, it just does this anyways. It's not like Hearthstone where you press the
[337.88s -> 344.15s]  button and it locks you into somebody. Am I going to get like stream sniped? This is what this game
[344.15s -> 353.62s]  is, right? It's just stream sniper of the game. Cancel it. I can cancel it. Just keep canceling
[353.62s -> 364.90s]  and keep looking for players until I like get rid of all of you. How many people are playing
[364.90s -> 371.72s]  this right now? Enough. Did I miss everything? Did I miss the boat? Oh no. Did I miss the boat?
[371.72s -> 392.66s]  I got, you got rid of us. Somebody gave 50 bucks. I have to say thank you. Thank you. Weak
[392.66s -> 399.16s]  cankles for the $50. It's a huge amount of fucking money. Thank you. Am I going to, is something
[399.16s -> 406.18s]  wrong with my computer? It happens a lot of this connection errors, but the servers are under
[406.18s -> 418.02s]  maintenance. Are they done? This is not like, Oh, are they? Do I have to do something else?
[418.02s -> 433.32s]  Did I restart the game? Oh no. The servers are down. What? Oh fuck. No, they're not. Let me see.
[433.32s -> 444.58s]  Wait, ball guys, Twitter. I waited like seven days to play this. Fuck. Don't play on day one. It's
[444.58s -> 447.54s]  going to be overloaded. Don't play on day two. Everyone's going to be really trying to play
[447.54s -> 450.82s]  because like all the streamers and YouTubers all played at the same time and everyone's playing
[450.82s -> 453.94s]  at the same time. And then like a week later, German nine, eight, five gets on the back of
[453.94s -> 461.56s]  the roller coaster and still fucked up. Is that, let me see. Is that for real? All guys, Twitter.
[461.56s -> 469.64s]  I don't see anything here. There's no scheduled maintenance. I'm just playing it again. I'm going
[469.64s -> 482.36s]  to try it again. I'm playing TF2. Oh yeah. If it doesn't work this time, I'll restart it.
[483.00s -> 500.25s]  Put the gibbous on. No, I'm not putting the gibbous on. The servers are actually down. Oh
[500.25s -> 519.69s]  damn it. How are they really? No. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to reset the game.
[520.25s -> 535.91s]  Hold on. Let's reset the game. Oh, that stinks. Did you just do a comb stream? Oh, I need to put
[535.91s -> 544.26s]  on clothes if I do that. Hold on. Let's try this again. Heroes of Might and Magic three. No,
[544.26s -> 556.57s]  I'm not prepared for that one right now. All guys. Well, I mean, I have a shit load of things
[556.57s -> 562.09s]  installed. We could just, we could pivot. I mean, we could pivot pretty quickly here to the complex,
[562.65s -> 566.97s]  which is an FMV choose your own adventure movie game made by the same people that made,
[567.61s -> 572.46s]  uh, Silent Night, whatever it's called. What the fuck is that game? The one where you drive the
[572.46s -> 576.54s]  car. The one where you, what's it called? It's not Silent Night. What is it called?
[577.82s -> 590.06s]  I got it. It's called like tonight. What was it called? Let's try this. Night shift. There it is.
[590.06s -> 603.70s]  Yeah. Made by the same people. Read this before you start. Yeah. It's made the same for the made
[603.70s -> 619.72s]  late shift made a new one. It's called the complex. I don't think this is going to work.
[619.72s -> 625.86s]  Keep trying. It takes like five tries to get in. How popular is this game? What is this the most
[625.86s -> 629.46s]  popular game ever? Is this the, this has got to be the most popular game on steam right now. It
[629.46s -> 649.93s]  has to be, right? Two million sold on steam. Oh my God. In like five days, you got to be shitting
[649.93s -> 669.69s]  me. 125,000 players right now at 10 AM. Holy shit. Well, turn off your VPN. You think that's
[669.69s -> 684.87s]  causing a problem? It shouldn't cause a problem. Yes. Yes. Yes. A hundred percent. No, no, that's
[684.87s -> 696.46s]  not a problem. No, that's not an issue. That's lying. The servers are crashed. All right. Well,
[696.46s -> 702.06s]  I don't want to just sit here and just stare at a guy falling for three hours. You guys do that
[702.06s -> 715.32s]  already. I don't want to sit here and do it with you. Uh, unable to find a match. What? All right.
[716.34s -> 723.78s]  I'm going to, we're going to give this a few minutes. Saw waiting room. No, no. Saw waiting
[723.78s -> 732.94s]  room. Oh, read Yelp reviews. I don't know. I'm not going to go for Yelp reviews. No, I'll go. Go
[732.94s -> 739.42s]  read Yelp reviews on stream. It's just, Hey guys, all the Yelp, all the places and restaurants that
[739.42s -> 743.58s]  I go to are going to drop by two stars because they're on stream. I'm not doing, I don't want
[743.58s -> 756.70s]  to do that. Don't fall one more time. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Turn the boot it back
[756.70s -> 764.87s]  up. Turn it back on. Get a server back on. We can, we can do this. We can, we, one of my, we can do
[764.87s -> 769.43s]  this. Who's the we in this scenario? I have nothing to do with this and neither do any of you.
[770.57s -> 774.49s]  This is somebody at an office or at a warehouse that has to like fix this. It'd be probably
[774.49s -> 780.15s]  freaking out right now. This has nothing to do with me. Oh, we can do this guys. What do you mean
[780.15s -> 788.23s]  we? No, you can't. Warehouse. Yeah. This is where they get, what do you think? They store all the
[788.23s -> 808.07s]  computers. They store a bunch of computers in a fucking cold ice room. Yes. All right. I'm going
[808.07s -> 812.47s]  to pivot. We got to pivot. Damn it. I wanted, I wanted to fucking play this dude. Shit. All right.
[812.47s -> 818.78s]  We're going to pivot to the complex. I feel like that's, I want to play it. It's a choose your own
[818.78s -> 828.14s]  movie game. You know, we love those. Come back in an hour. We'll see how long I think this, I think
[828.14s -> 835.10s]  the complex is like an hour. So we're good. Right? Let's go. I'll come back and try it. And wait,
[835.10s -> 844.38s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. What happened? Did I play? I'll come back in an hour. We're going to do the
[844.38s -> 855.14s]  complex and I'm going to come back. Dammit. Complex is a 90 hour game. That's, it's a 90 minute game.
[855.14s -> 863.30s]  I think you read the second word wrong. I got to change my title. Shit. What am I? It takes me like
[863.30s -> 872.47s]  two hours to come up with a title for a stream. How about like movies? Um, choose. I don't know.
[872.47s -> 889.51s]  The servers are back. Don't do that to me. Servers are back. No, they're not. Are there people
[889.51s -> 895.35s]  fucking around? Are they actually back? Can somebody please tell me that they're back?
[895.35s -> 900.20s]  And I don't want like three of you to say this. Servers are back. They're back. They're actually
[900.20s -> 904.36s]  back online. Actually online. It's better not be a debate. I'm going to be really mad if it is.
[904.36s -> 922.36s]  It's a lot of you are saying it. I mean, I opened the game. I was, is this real? I'm in a game right
[922.36s -> 926.84s]  now. They're not back. Multiple one guys actually back. Am I, I'm just getting, why did I even open
[926.84s -> 932.81s]  the fuck up? Why did I even open this? Why did I open this again? Why? What's the point? What's
[932.81s -> 941.99s]  the point of this? This is a lie. Do a political stream. That's the last thing I'm going to do ever.
[942.79s -> 962.06s]  No, were you lying to me or what? I'm not going to do this again. I'm not going to do this. No. All
[962.06s -> 966.70s]  right. Okay. It was, it was a bunch of bullshit. Fine. I'm not listening to you guys ever again,
[969.03s -> 973.83s]  but I don't care if I'm like standing somewhere and there was a car behind me, like literally
[973.83s -> 981.30s]  like, and the guy behind the wheel is leaning forward with this wicked fucking angry face.
[982.50s -> 985.62s]  And he's, and he's coming for me and I'm just sitting there talking to you guys and you're
[985.62s -> 989.06s]  going to be like turn around. There's a guy with the fucking guts, right? I'm not even going to
[989.06s -> 999.38s]  fucking listen to you. I've never listened to you guys ever again. I mean wicked. What? All right.
[999.38s -> 1004.30s]  We're going to do. Okay. How was I, this is just a movie. I don't even know what this movie game is
[1004.30s -> 1010.01s]  about. We're going to play it. How about just, I'm naming this string complex. Who cares? Nobody
[1010.01s -> 1021.96s]  cares about the title. It doesn't matter. I do. Hey, the servers are back online.
[1024.36s -> 1032.33s]  They could be. Let's see how this is. Let's see if this game is any good. When did this come out?
[1032.33s -> 1057.30s]  Turn off your fucking VPN. Servers are up. Maybe I don't want to play this. Well, I, I wasn't ready
[1057.30s -> 1063.67s]  for this one. Ironically too. All right. I'm turning. All right. No, no, no, I'm moving on.
[1063.67s -> 1073.77s]  Let's go. Turn off your VPN. All right. It's no, it's not real. It's, it's not real. You're fucking me
[1073.77s -> 1082.33s]  up. No, they're not. All right. I'm, I'm opening this game. Turn off your VPN. Don't turn it off.
[1082.33s -> 1090.95s]  Don't fall for it. I don't want to play the complex. What do I play instead? I don't want
[1090.95s -> 1104.06s]  to do this right now. To open up AI dungeon. Actually, that's not a bad idea. It's not a
[1104.06s -> 1110.87s]  terrible idea. Either that or Nancy Drew. I'm ready to, I'm ready to go full on fucking just
[1110.87s -> 1131.42s]  Nancy Drew. Let me see. Is AI dungeon in the same spot that it was before? Or do I have to do that
[1131.42s -> 1150.63s]  thing again? Boy, I said the word Nancy Drew. God damn it. Didn't I? Let me just do this.
[1151.27s -> 1157.83s]  So the AI dungeon, AI dungeon.io, is that a better version than the other one before? You remember
[1157.83s -> 1163.00s]  how it was kind of not as good as the other one? That like kind of Google doc one, whatever it was.
[1163.00s -> 1179.21s]  So it's, it's good now. Let me just put this on. Oh, is German 95 emotionally today? Good or bad?
[1179.21s -> 1182.97s]  Well, it started good. And then I couldn't play the game that I wanted to play. And it just threw a
[1182.97s -> 1187.37s]  wrench into my, it just threw a wrench into my window. And so now I have to figure out what I'm
[1187.37s -> 1196.92s]  going to do. And that's how it happens. End of the stream voice. No, I should have been more
[1196.92s -> 1207.43s]  prepared to have a backup. All right. Let me get this going. Can I capture this? You'd have like
[1207.43s -> 1226.92s]  music and shit. What is this? Cause I changed this thing. All right. I have to open up a game. I
[1226.92s -> 1230.76s]  can't capture this window right now. I changed a bunch of dumb shit around. I'm just going to,
[1230.76s -> 1235.56s]  I'm just opening up Nancy Drew. I don't even care. I don't even, I don't even know what one is
[1235.56s -> 1247.08s]  installed. I'm just going to open one fall guys, but you fall forever. I'm opening up.
[1247.08s -> 1251.96s]  This is just until I can play fall guys. Uh, how about Nancy, Nancy drew secret of the old clock.
[1251.96s -> 1262.94s]  Wait, did I already play this one? Nancy drew treasure in the Royal tower. Nancy drew the VPN
[1262.94s -> 1272.68s]  clock. All right. I'm going to play Nancy drew treasure in the Royal tower. And I'm going to hate
[1272.68s -> 1278.84s]  every second of this. I can't believe that you're getting what you want. I can't believe
