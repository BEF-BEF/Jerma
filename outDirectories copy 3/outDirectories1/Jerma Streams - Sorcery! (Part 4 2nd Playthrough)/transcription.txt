[3.19s -> 11.13s]  Alrighty, how you doing? Welcome back. We're going to continue our journey through
[11.13s -> 22.74s]  Kare, city blood of traps. Got my tea here. I also have a coffee too from earlier, which gross.
[22.74s -> 39.48s]  He spelled completing wrong. I don't, I don't care. Where? In the tweet? Or here? Because I gotta be
[39.48s -> 47.32s]  honest, in the world of 2022, spelling mistakes no one cares about anymore. They really just don't.
[48.33s -> 55.13s]  Back in like the 40s, or like the 50s. It's like, oh, you misspelled that on minus five points on
[55.13s -> 60.41s]  your grade. Who gives a shit? Nobody cares. We all are talking to each other. We all know what we're
[60.41s -> 69.16s]  trying to say. Nobody cares about how you spelled a word right. You're not going to put a red pen
[69.16s -> 74.52s]  through it and put like, oh, excuse me. You know what I'm saying. We both know what I'm trying to
[74.52s -> 89.77s]  say. Am I going to delete the tweet? No, I'm leaving it. The tweet is staying as is.
[90.81s -> 102.62s]  If we all started not caring, we would make a new language. All right. But okay, I get it. If I,
[102.62s -> 107.74s]  if I was sending like a formal letter to something, to someone, I would want to make sure it didn't
[107.74s -> 120.07s]  say like completely. But hey, I'm just in a live stream. It's just me hanging out, tweeted again.
[123.86s -> 127.62s]  Yeah. For those of you that are, have asked about it or wondering about it, the thing that I was
[127.62s -> 133.62s]  talking about on Thursday has been announced and it's going to be a wild one. Uh, I did not know,
[134.42s -> 142.60s]  I did not know my team until an hour ago. Uh, this is going to be crazy. So myth is putting on
[142.60s -> 153.56s]  a black ops two event and I'm on one of the teams and, uh, I hope I do. Okay. I haven't played call
[153.56s -> 165.99s]  of duty in like eight years. Go look, go to myth's Twitter and look at the two teams.
[166.95s -> 172.71s]  I am going to be the worst fucking person on this team. I'm actually, I'm actually quite concerned
[172.71s -> 177.59s]  about it. I'm going to be, I'm going to download black ops two tonight and just play it all night
[177.59s -> 186.62s]  and just try to not embarrass myself in front of like a hundred million people tomorrow practice
[186.62s -> 196.82s]  now. No, I don't, I, I'm not practicing right now. Do you need some coaching help? I might,
[196.82s -> 205.11s]  I may need some pointers. Am I going to stream it? I don't know. I'll, uh, I got to talk to myth
[205.11s -> 213.37s]  and see what the plan is. I'm not a hundred percent sure, but we'll see that 6 PM tomorrow.
[213.37s -> 220.54s]  I believe that's six Pacific and let me check again. Yes. Tomorrow at six Pacific. I believe
[220.54s -> 233.85s]  it will at very least be on myth's channel. I would assume it was redacted. I don't know.
[236.06s -> 250.97s]  I genuinely don't know. I'm being serious. I have no idea. I need to, I look, all I remember from
[250.97s -> 261.72s]  call of duty is so hold hitting shift to sprint and then right clicking and, and then dying.
[261.72s -> 269.70s]  That's the only thing I remember. I don't remember anything else. I remember people just dropping
[269.70s -> 277.11s]  down to prone and then I remember dropping a grenade because I was one of those assholes.
[277.67s -> 281.37s]  What was that thing called again? Is whenever, every time you died, you dropped a grenade on
[281.37s -> 290.73s]  the ground and people wanted to band from the game. It was like, please ban this from the game.
[290.73s -> 294.41s]  Get rid of this. It's doesn't need to be in the game. And I would get kills
[294.41s -> 298.74s]  just because I died near like somebody. Yeah. I was, I was one of those people
[301.67s -> 306.39s]  and I was one of those people. And at the same time, I also was mad at those people.
[307.35s -> 314.79s]  I had, yeah, martyrdom. I had martyrdom equipped and I would kill somebody with martyrdom
[314.79s -> 324.09s]  and die from it and go, fuck that loser. And I had it equipped. That's my experience.
[324.09s -> 340.55s]  I hope I, I hope I do okay. I'll try. Dude, you're going to be comic relief.
[341.27s -> 349.43s]  Do I just bring a slide whistle to this event tomorrow? I'm going to go 0 and 15, right? I
[349.43s -> 356.95s]  might as well be like, I should make sounds and shit. Like I'm just going to be the jester.
[360.57s -> 366.68s]  Watch me play like crazy though. That would be fun. Happy birthday to my friend, please. Hey,
[367.78s -> 372.12s]  Montes's friend. Happy birthday. No one else is getting that by the way.
[375.18s -> 379.50s]  Do what you're good at. You're good at something. Never do it for free.
[384.09s -> 389.10s]  You see, but that's the problem, right? I've told you guys this before and I mean this.
[391.11s -> 395.51s]  Okay. If I'm, if I'm like the weird clown guy that makes sound effects with his mouth,
[396.47s -> 401.27s]  that's what I do over here. But if I go into an environment where I'm on a team with people
[401.27s -> 408.47s]  and I, and I'm just like, people are going to be like, shut this fucking guy up.
[408.47s -> 412.97s]  Shut this guy up. I don't want to hear this guy talking anymore. You know what I mean? Like you,
[412.97s -> 425.48s]  we can't bring that to somebody else's house, right? Usually that's how I feel. I can't,
[425.48s -> 430.28s]  right? I have to at least dial it back a little. And I'm not even that I don't do that that often
[430.28s -> 434.20s]  anyways. Can we give him, I'm going to give him some a little bit of credit. I don't do that
[434.20s -> 439.32s]  anyways, but I don't want to do that in a lobby with other people that might be streaming
[440.04s -> 454.10s]  and they don't want to hear my horse shit. You need to do it more. Why else would they invite
[454.10s -> 462.14s]  you? Oh, come on. Come on. Like myth is running the event. He's got like a clipboard. He's like,
[462.14s -> 465.74s]  it's been a bunch of time planning this. And he comes over to our lobby and he's like,
[465.74s -> 472.20s]  what the fuck, man? Dermot's not making fucking sound effects. What that's what he's doing here.
[473.00s -> 481.83s]  What? Come on, man. You're supposed to be doing sound effects. No, I'm kidding. It'll be a good
[481.83s -> 488.02s]  time. I'm really looking forward to it. It should be a lot of fun. I'm going to say,
[488.02s -> 502.90s]  I might surprise a lot of you. I really might the wrong discord. It's because you try to seem
[502.90s -> 517.75s]  normal in front of the other streamers. That's not true. No, it's not. It's because you're a vegan
[517.75s -> 534.28s]  furry. Yeah, but I actually think it's going to be a lot of fun. Obviously myth reached out and it
[534.28s -> 544.38s]  was just cool. That's a really cool dude. Really, really funny guy. So I'm honored to be invited to
[544.38s -> 548.06s]  the first place. So I'm going to try to bring it my all. I'll bring it what I can. And by the way,
[548.06s -> 551.66s]  this has just been going in my head the whole time. I've not heard anything else and I'm sitting
[551.66s -> 562.10s]  there going, this sounds weird. It's just cats. It's just in sorcery. Well, now they're not there
[562.10s -> 569.82s]  anymore and you don't hear them. All right. So again, we're going to try to beat part two.
[569.82s -> 575.88s]  We're going to try. We're going to absolutely get to the end of part two. Sorcery part two today.
[575.88s -> 584.81s]  Black Ops 2 event tomorrow. It's going to be a wild time. I'm going to do my best. And then green
[584.81s -> 600.39s]  screen part two movie night is on Saturday. Very cool. You guys ready? Cast some sorceries already,
[600.39s -> 605.98s]  man. I'm going. I'm going. I wanted to talk about that. This is a cool event. I'm participating
[605.98s -> 614.89s]  in tomorrow. I'm going to talk about it. All right. So let's let's recap on what happened
[614.89s -> 626.18s]  yesterday. If you remember, for those of you that are vaude Andes, I would watch that first
[626.18s -> 633.00s]  because you're going to get a big spoiler here. We got to the gate, North Gate of Carr, which is
[633.00s -> 641.29s]  the end of part two. But all these animals are just talking over me. When you get to the end of
[641.29s -> 646.09s]  sorcery part two, if you haven't technically completed the game, it gives you an option,
[646.09s -> 652.33s]  gives you the choice to either just go on and say, fuck it, who cares, or be able to go back
[652.33s -> 656.65s]  and try to get the rest of the spell lines. And that's what we did. So we are still looking for
[656.65s -> 662.57s]  one more line. And it's down here where we have not been down here at all. We have to somehow
[662.57s -> 668.95s]  make our way from here down to here or make our way from here to here and restart it one more
[668.95s -> 676.12s]  time down here. Are you ready? The last thing we did, we went to the council meeting with Flanker.
[676.92s -> 691.78s]  There's nobody there for the council. Bro, play something normal. Play something normal? What do
[691.78s -> 707.90s]  you mean? We're playing Black Ops 2 tomorrow. That's pretty normal. All right, the docks.
[707.90s -> 721.42s]  I would call that a pretty normal video game, wouldn't you? No, Call of Duty is not like a...
[721.42s -> 727.69s]  What would you consider a normal game? That's a genuine question. What would you consider
[727.69s -> 735.30s]  a normal game? I played multiverses. Multiverses was a few days ago. Black Ops 3, Destiny 2.
[736.60s -> 743.91s]  I don't want to play those games. Phosphor 2 is normal. Yeah, what's so abnormal about this?
[744.55s -> 748.31s]  All right, so we're at the docks. You return to the docks. You still need to find somewhere to
[748.31s -> 753.50s]  stay for the night, which if you remember... Oh, it's still nighttime. We haven't gone to bed yet.
[754.97s -> 760.25s]  Sleep in an alley. Sleep by the river. Sleep in the market. Or the meet and cleaver had that
[761.45s -> 769.29s]  musical act. It was there, right? We could head over here. That's where the musicians were.
[771.61s -> 776.33s]  We met the band down here. We shook their hand and it was like, yeah, come hang out at the
[776.33s -> 785.99s]  meet and cleaver later. So let's do that. All games are normal games. You know what a normal...
[785.99s -> 792.71s]  Okay, an abnormal game would be like... I don't know. How many times can you do a backflip in a
[792.71s -> 800.60s]  row? That's kind of abnormal, right? If we're playing... That's like Mew, who can do more
[800.60s -> 813.62s]  backflips in a row? It's not like a normal game. How many times can you do backflips in a row?
[813.62s -> 822.23s]  I don't know. None? That's just gymnastics. Well, no, that would be abnormal for me to just turn
[822.23s -> 825.67s]  the camera on and do that. Like, hey guys, I'm going to play how many backflips can I do in a
[825.67s -> 828.87s]  row? It's like, what are you doing? This is like a video game. This is like just a normal game,
[828.87s -> 835.94s]  but like normal rules. That would be abnormal. That would be weird, right? So that's what...
[835.94s -> 840.98s]  What are you talking about? All right, let's go. Let's go. I'm not talking about abnormal
[840.98s -> 847.35s]  games versus normal games. All right. We're in the meet and cleaver. The meet and cleaver is
[847.35s -> 853.19s]  a small, grimy place. It looks like it's been converted from a wood store. Rats run across the
[853.19s -> 858.79s]  floor and the customers at the tables look haggard and tired, as if just smelling the air is draining
[858.79s -> 864.54s]  them. Damn. By the bar, a stooped and hunched innkeeper wipes his beer mugs with a filthy
[864.54s -> 874.47s]  handkerchief. All right, Jerry the musician's over here, which is the person we want to talk to.
[876.95s -> 883.38s]  So, I mean, we're going to go hang out with him, obviously. How many backflips can you actually do?
[883.46s -> 890.66s]  I used to be able to do one. I definitely can't do that anymore. You look for Jira, but eventually
[890.66s -> 895.21s]  it is he who spots you, waving from a particularly dark corner of the inn.
[896.15s -> 903.26s]  Come and sit with us. We've got food to share and company. Sit, but don't eat. Sit. Reject the offer.
[903.26s -> 906.82s]  Why would I reject the offer? This guy's been nothing but kind to me. Why would it be like,
[906.82s -> 920.01s]  no, fuck you. I'm going to sit. Thank you. You follow him to his table and sit down with three
[920.01s -> 923.93s]  others that you recognized from the performance at the fair earlier. Their table is spread with
[924.81s -> 931.83s]  delicacies, fried hill fox feet, curried ball eye beans, and a thin green plant in oil
[931.83s -> 941.43s]  that might be stewed grass. You eat greedily. So, how have you enjoyed your day in Carré?
[941.43s -> 946.38s]  This city is filthy. Jira looks at his friends and they all laugh.
[947.70s -> 954.33s]  It is, but it is no one's fault. Everyone who lives here generates just as much mess as everyone
[954.33s -> 958.44s]  else. One of the dancers, a tall thin woman with a thoughtful expression says,
[959.32s -> 966.04s]  the problem is the poverty. Everyone is so poor. There's no one poor enough to clean the streets.
[966.04s -> 971.90s]  Jira introduces his friend with a gesture. This is Almira. She's a dancer, but don't let that fool
[971.90s -> 979.46s]  you. She's a thoughtful soul, if ever there was one. Almira nods her head. The only choice is
[979.46s -> 986.02s]  poop water. Yeah, they're pumping poop water from the river and drinking it and pretending it's beer.
[986.02s -> 994.60s]  That's not good. All right, greetings. Almira smiles once and then turns back to her food.
[994.60s -> 1006.65s]  Jira crunches on a battered skunk bear toe. So, are you staying here tonight? Yeah, for free. Yeah,
[1006.65s -> 1011.80s]  I go, yeah. And then I look at him and I kind of cock my head to the side. For free. I just look
[1011.80s -> 1019.10s]  at this guy. I'm like, for free. The guy's like, come on, man. He nods. You're a brave man. I don't
[1019.10s -> 1025.53s]  know many as would risk the beds at the heated reaver or whatever this place is called. The owner
[1025.53s -> 1034.76s]  makes good rat bone fritters, but he's a few giblets short of a casserole. A few giblets short
[1034.76s -> 1044.36s]  of a casserole. Where should I stay? The other inn isn't bad, though I hear that Vic tends to scoop
[1044.36s -> 1053.54s]  up the drunks. He nods meaningfully. Oh, Vic's a friend of mine. Oh, that's what happened. Okay.
[1053.54s -> 1062.06s]  Yeah, that's what happened last time. Well, then I won't drink. All right, let's get some info.
[1062.06s -> 1069.10s]  Who is he? Vic? I wouldn't say Vic was a good man to know. Or rather, there's many who know him
[1069.10s -> 1075.48s]  and wish they didn't. Vic's a bad man. Head of the slave ring and looking to be head of a lot more,
[1075.48s -> 1082.04s]  or so I hear. Almir agrees. They say he intends to overrun the council. That's impossible,
[1082.04s -> 1089.27s]  but if he's planning it, I suspect he has a trick up his sleeve. A kind of trick. I have no idea,
[1089.27s -> 1093.77s]  but Vic is a very clever man, indeed, and not afraid to work in league with sorceries and the
[1093.77s -> 1101.30s]  darker arts. Jura tries to lighten the tone, raising a toast with his mug. I need to find
[1101.30s -> 1106.65s]  a blind beggar. That's what I'm looking for. This is accurate, right? Maybe they know where he is.
[1106.65s -> 1115.43s]  We're looking for Theda. I need to find a blind beggar, one of the nobles. Jura looks blank.
[1116.38s -> 1121.54s]  You might find such a man somewhere in Kaare. You might find a hundred such. Hope you know what
[1121.54s -> 1127.22s]  your beggar looks like, because otherwise, how would you know you had the right one? It's late.
[1127.22s -> 1132.26s]  We should be going. Almir nods and takes his hand. Arm in arm, they bid you farewell and leave the
[1132.26s -> 1145.96s]  inn. All right. Am I sleeping here or am I going to go sleep outside somewhere? Do I sleep outside
[1145.96s -> 1151.90s]  or sleep in here? I feel like I want to get attacked in here or something. I'm going to
[1151.90s -> 1159.94s]  get attacked in here. Should I go sleep outside? All right. What is it? How much does it cost? I'm
[1159.94s -> 1165.10s]  going to get attacked. All right. You march over to the bar. The innkeeper stands up as straight
[1165.10s -> 1175.24s]  as he can to greet you. How is trade here? The man peers at you. Trade? This is a docks and I
[1175.24s -> 1180.42s]  sell beer. Trade is the same as it's always been. I know the city is supposed to be going to the
[1180.42s -> 1184.90s]  dogs and falling apart, but I don't believe it. People are always saying that, but they're still
[1184.90s -> 1196.17s]  in here most nights drinking their beer. I need food. How much is food? We're out of food, I'm
[1196.17s -> 1202.89s]  afraid. He points to a group in one corner. Bo's lot ate everything. Musicians. They're always
[1202.89s -> 1209.64s]  hungry, but good for drinking. Oh, no, I did eat. I already did eat. Never mind. I ate all the food.
[1210.28s -> 1216.44s]  I'm sitting here going, oh man, I'm hungry. I haven't eaten anything all day. Like I just ate.
[1216.44s -> 1222.30s]  I literally just ate all their food and I'm looking for more? I'm the problem. I'm one of
[1222.30s -> 1230.86s]  the musicians. I was part of their group. All right, what about a room? Do you have rooms? The
[1230.86s -> 1239.10s]  innkeeper nods and smiles a wide, almost wicked smile. We do. Best in Kare, if I say so myself.
[1239.90s -> 1247.77s]  People who stay here never stay anywhere is good again. Oh, gold pieces. Yeah, that's fucked up.
[1247.77s -> 1254.23s]  That's a weird way. Why would you? That's weird. That was a weird way to say that.
[1261.34s -> 1273.96s]  Should I just leave outside? I'm gonna sleep outside. I'm gonna go sleep in the water. Yeah,
[1273.96s -> 1279.50s]  I'm out of here. No, I don't know. I was specifically told not to stay here by the musicians.
[1279.50s -> 1284.49s]  They literally said don't stay here. He was like, hey, don't sleep there. This place is fucking
[1284.49s -> 1291.58s]  dump. Don't sleep there. I'm gonna listen to him. I'm not sleeping here. You walk back out to the
[1291.58s -> 1303.16s]  docks. All right. Back to the dock. You're running out of options. Sleep in an alley,
[1303.16s -> 1306.44s]  sit by the river or sleep in the market. All right. I don't know which one. I don't know
[1306.44s -> 1313.64s]  what you want to do. First poll of the night. One is sleep in alley, two is sit by the river,
[1313.64s -> 1324.34s]  and three is sleep in the market. I get to pull up right here. One, two or three. Where we going?
[1328.57s -> 1332.57s]  One is the alley, two is by the river, and three is in the market. I'm not sleeping in that end.
[1333.37s -> 1350.58s]  No, fuck that. What do you feel? By the river. By the river? Isn't that like out in the open?
[1351.38s -> 1360.18s]  I'm just gonna be lying on the beach in the open. Isn't that bad? You really want me to do that?
[1361.34s -> 1370.47s]  Okay. Carré is a renowned city as thieves and villains and has not earned that reputation for
[1370.47s -> 1377.13s]  nothing. To sleep outside is to invite disaster. Instead, you seat yourself by the edge of the fat
[1377.13s -> 1383.86s]  slug-like Fubaji River where the air is by turns fresh and stomach-turningly rancid, both of which
[1383.86s -> 1390.28s]  should help you to stay awake through the long watches of the night. Oh, I'm not gonna sleep.
[1390.28s -> 1396.52s]  Hey, you sit watching the river as it creeps past. Today has been a successful day.
[1397.08s -> 1402.20s]  You've made progress towards learning the lines of the Northgate spell. After a while, you notice
[1402.20s -> 1412.73s]  a light on the far bank. Oh, it's because I'm staying. I'm tanking the whole day. That's why.
[1412.73s -> 1419.91s]  Okay. Let's watch it. It is a lantern. For a while, it moves forward and backwards, then is
[1419.91s -> 1425.85s]  joined by several more. Voices call to one another. They're looking for escapers, but escaping from
[1425.85s -> 1434.20s]  what you cannot tell. As dawn breaks, one calls, Vic will be pleased. Clear night tonight. That
[1434.20s -> 1441.24s]  name again. Glandragor's friend. The men disappear as the sun begins to rise. Your long vigil has
[1441.24s -> 1450.28s]  left you tired out, but still in one piece. I got the health back. I got the health back.
[1450.28s -> 1465.22s]  I'm good. I'm good to go. All right, the next morning. As the sun breaks over the rooftops
[1465.22s -> 1470.10s]  of Lower Kare, the city looks clean and bright, like a stone polished to a shine by a fast-flowing
[1470.10s -> 1475.18s]  river. The effect lasts for a beautiful moment, and then the people of Kare begin to stir,
[1475.18s -> 1480.06s]  opening their windows to throw out their slop, shouting and cursing at each other as they do so.
[1482.34s -> 1490.33s]  The word slop. That's one of my favorite words. Can I just tell you? The word slop is just,
[1490.33s -> 1500.57s]  it has so much weight behind it. It can be used as an insult. It can be used as a means of
[1503.50s -> 1508.62s]  endearment, right? Oh, you're going to serve me this slop? That's not endearment. That's
[1508.62s -> 1516.26s]  fucking horrible. That's really insulting. It's only as an insult. Oh, hey, yeah. Give me some
[1516.26s -> 1523.30s]  of that. Imagine calling something slop at a dinner. Dude, what the fuck did you just call
[1523.30s -> 1529.96s]  my cooking? Oh, so what I have here is I have a pan-seared salmon. Yeah, I'm a big salmon guy.
[1529.96s -> 1538.71s]  And I have broccolini, very lightly torched to a nice crunch on the outside. Yeah, give me some
[1538.71s -> 1548.58s]  of that slop. That's so gross sounding. All right, whatever. It's only used as something gross or an
[1548.58s -> 1556.49s]  insult. Okay, the effect lasts for a beautiful moment, then the people come out. The city is
[1556.49s -> 1564.60s]  stirring again. Now we're going to head for the bridge. The market traders begin to set up their
[1564.60s -> 1570.28s]  stalls fighting and threatening each other to get the spots closest to the ships. A few sly types,
[1570.28s -> 1577.98s]  probably pickpockets, begin to prowl the shadows between the stands. Oh, well, real quick. Should
[1577.98s -> 1584.78s]  I play that new horror game that just came out? What's it called? Some of the Assistant or
[1584.78s -> 1597.08s]  something? Yeah, the Mortuary Assistant. Yeah. All right, no spoilers. I'm going to play it.
[1597.08s -> 1607.62s]  I'll play it like the next stream or two. Yeah. All right, I'll play it. You're going to die
[1607.62s -> 1614.84s]  playing that. I'll play it. It's really glitchy and buggy. Well, maybe it'll be fixed in the next,
[1614.84s -> 1626.33s]  like, I don't know. Maybe they'll do a patch for it. Yeah, we'll do that in the next few days.
[1626.33s -> 1631.96s]  Okay, cool. You can do the next parts of sorcery. Well, here's the thing, right? I want to make sure
[1631.96s -> 1638.01s]  that it's not just only sorcery, because it's been pretty much a focus for the last couple of weeks.
[1638.01s -> 1648.12s]  So we'll break it up. If you want to watch the sorcery stuff, it'll probably be there.
[1648.20s -> 1660.06s]  There'll be some more stuff in between. So, yeah. Look, I would. I don't care if there's, you know,
[1660.06s -> 1663.02s]  less viewers here or anything. That's fine. This is one of my favorite games of all time. I'll play
[1663.02s -> 1668.98s]  this all day, right? That's fine. I get it, too. If you don't want to, like, kind of sit here and,
[1668.98s -> 1674.90s]  like, chill, like, have, like, essentially read a book together. I get it. I do. But for those of
[1674.90s -> 1681.98s]  you that do like it, then we'll keep doing it. But for those of you that don't, then whatever.
[1681.98s -> 1690.95s]  Maybe we'll see you on the next one. It's all good. I don't care. If there's 5k, 10k, 30k,
[1690.95s -> 1697.29s]  whatever. People like different shit. That's fine. Let's keep going.
[1697.29s -> 1702.09s]  The market traders begin to set up their stalls, fighting and threatening each other to get the
[1702.09s -> 1707.67s]  spots closest to the ships. A few sly types pickpockets. I already read this. I should buy
[1707.67s -> 1717.66s]  breakfast. You wander the stalls looking for something to eat and find a stand selling
[1717.66s -> 1722.95s]  bomba bread for two gold pieces. The smell is quite nourishing. I definitely need it.
[1722.95s -> 1733.53s]  Ooh. All right. Okay. You buy a slice of the bread. It is pleasantly filling with a sweet,
[1733.53s -> 1738.66s]  meaty texture. You thank the woman at the stall and head over to the river to wait for the bridge
[1738.66s -> 1744.33s]  to be lowered. After a while, a grizzled old man arrives and unlocks a small booth by the harbor
[1744.33s -> 1759.74s]  bridge. He goes inside and closes the door behind him. Meaty bread? Yeah, it means when you pull it
[1759.74s -> 1764.95s]  open, you get the steam that comes out and it's really chunky and, like, fleshy on the inside.
[1766.07s -> 1771.56s]  I know what they're talking about. All right. Should we go knock on the booth? I'm going to
[1771.56s -> 1777.46s]  wait. You sit down outside the booth to wait for the man to lower the harbor bridge. After a while,
[1777.46s -> 1782.90s]  something happens. The old man leaves his booth and goes over to a contraption on the waterfront.
[1782.90s -> 1789.21s]  He begins to heave and wind an ancient winch. It seems to be quite hard work. He's trying to move
[1789.21s -> 1800.49s]  the whole weight of the bridge single-handedly. Can I go help? Excuse me. Let me help. That's the
[1800.49s -> 1807.88s]  way that Hannibal Lecter would describe meat. You get to your feet and go over to help the man out.
[1809.59s -> 1819.10s]  Get off. You'll break it. Okay. Don't help him. You let the man struggle, happy to let him be
[1819.10s -> 1824.86s]  stubborn. Sweat feeds on his forehead and he heaves and puffs as he works, but eventually the bridge
[1824.86s -> 1830.92s]  clunks down into place. You salute the man cheerfully and get to your feet. All right.
[1830.92s -> 1839.88s]  Cross the bridge. You cross the bridge over the Jojube River, which runs like a slime trail through
[1839.88s -> 1852.81s]  the center of the city. Oh, that's fucking gross. Andy Funny Voices. You said that wrong. Andy Funny
[1852.81s -> 1860.26s]  Voices. No, no, no, no, no. Excuse me. I gotta correct you. That's Funny Voice Andy. Andy Funny Voices.
[1860.26s -> 1870.78s]  You flipped it. You gotta get, come on, you gotta get it right. Funny Voice Andy. Come on. Andy
[1870.78s -> 1875.90s]  Funny Voices. I love that. That's my favorite comment of the week. That's so, I love that wording.
[1875.90s -> 1882.95s]  Time that person up for five seconds. You've reached the banks of Uppercare. The buildings
[1882.95s -> 1888.55s]  here are not as grand as on the south side of the river. They're in much better condition. Fewer
[1888.55s -> 1894.18s]  people live on this side away from the fields and the hills, but those that do are richer. They are
[1894.18s -> 1899.34s]  also most likely more dangerous. But of course, it is on this side of the city that the north gate
[1899.34s -> 1908.57s]  stands. You follow the road away from the river towards the fork in the road. Okay, we need to go
[1908.57s -> 1913.43s]  down here and I don't know if we can get there from here. I think it's impossible. Maybe it's not.
[1914.31s -> 1927.08s]  If we go here and then down, maybe. We'll try it. Yep, the sun is rising over the streets of Uppercare.
[1927.08s -> 1930.68s]  A few creatures roam this way and that unaware that they have walked these streets in just this
[1930.68s -> 1935.46s]  fashion once before. In one corner, a spring bubbles with fresh water. Oh, I remember this.
[1935.46s -> 1940.17s]  Drink it. You cup your hand in the water and drink a mouthful. It is fresh and invigorating
[1940.17s -> 1946.26s]  as though the water was enchanted. Okay, move on. We gotta go down. There we go. All right,
[1946.26s -> 1953.72s]  let's make our way down to the ruins. Where's the water coming from? I don't ask that question.
[1953.72s -> 1960.58s]  We don't ask that question. Got a lot of stamina now. You turn right heading away from the city
[1960.58s -> 1965.54s]  wall. A sign points towards Fireview Square. You pass large houses that are the aspect of official
[1965.54s -> 1972.15s]  places of business. One is marked with the clawed fist of a money lender. An elven woman is just
[1972.15s -> 1981.43s]  leaving. She looks quite worn out already this early in the morning. You stop the woman with a
[1981.43s -> 1988.71s]  gesture. She looks up at you in some surprise. Uh, you seem distraught. What's this building?
[1989.35s -> 1994.14s]  The woman looks at you in some surprise as though she thinks your question must be a joke.
[1994.14s -> 2002.07s]  It's a money lender. The why they call themselves that I don't know. She gulps back a sob. They've
[2002.07s -> 2013.61s]  turned you down. They're the worst kind of thieves. What happened? Did they turn you down? She looks
[2013.61s -> 2022.58s]  at you. Her narrow eyes wide. Oh, stranger. You have no idea. I'll help you. What do you need?
[2022.58s -> 2029.88s]  She pulls a face. You? Why would you do that? I cannot pay you. I'm sure you can guess. I'm an
[2029.88s -> 2043.13s]  adventurer. I help people. Perhaps you can help me. I don't know. What should I say? Well,
[2043.13s -> 2046.73s]  wait, maybe you know some, I just love the information, right? Perhaps you can help me.
[2047.93s -> 2056.76s]  I'm new to Kare. Is that so? Then maybe, maybe you'll need a guide. I don't want to guide.
[2056.76s -> 2062.82s]  I don't want to guide. I travel alone. I don't want to guide. It's a dangerous city full of traps.
[2063.38s -> 2071.64s]  A friendly hand wouldn't do you harm, would it? No, no, no, I don't trust anybody. I don't trust a
[2071.64s -> 2087.51s]  single person. I don't want guys. I don't want to get like clubbed. You know what I mean? It's like,
[2087.51s -> 2091.19s]  oh, yeah, come this way down this down this alley. And there's a guy I get fucking clubbed in the
[2091.19s -> 2095.86s]  back of the head by some fucking thief. I don't want to do that. That's happened to us like at
[2095.86s -> 2108.90s]  least once or twice so far. It's like, oh, yeah, I bumped into you and took like three items. All
[2108.90s -> 2112.98s]  right. I'll leave it up to you guys. What do you think? Do we want a guide? Do we want someone to
[2112.98s -> 2123.08s]  travel with us or no? So the poll will be one for yeah. Oh, well, we're doing it.
[2123.88s -> 2131.83s]  I didn't mean to do that. Very well. She smiles the first true smile you've seen in her face.
[2131.83s -> 2136.79s]  Very good stranger. I'll be happy to help you if I can for a fee. Where do you want to go? Oh,
[2139.21s -> 2146.84s]  oh shit. She actually might help. I need to find a beggar in the ruins. She nods. The falling
[2146.84s -> 2152.09s]  quarter. That's very easy to find if you can avoid the traps. She nods clearly pleased.
[2156.36s -> 2168.15s]  Take me there. I'll kill you. Like I pulled a sword out. I'm not going to right now. I got
[2168.15s -> 2175.62s]  threatened. We can't be this like psycho that starts a car. This has happened. This has happened.
[2176.50s -> 2180.44s]  My last place where I remember this is getting halfway through a conversation
[2181.00s -> 2186.42s]  and then throwing a rock at someone like, oh, yeah, I'm new in town. I'm the Annalander.
[2186.42s -> 2192.82s]  What's your name? Oh, I'm the great sage of the of the of the Western ruins. Oh, interesting. Can
[2192.82s -> 2199.08s]  you help me? Sword comes out sticking to their neck at their neck. Like what? Why start the
[2199.08s -> 2205.08s]  conversation if you're going to just threaten to kill somebody? Oh, yeah, like I'm enjoying my time.
[2205.08s -> 2208.92s]  We're having a good time around this campfire. I'm going to craft a fireball and just lob it
[2208.92s -> 2214.68s]  in the air above me and then run. Well, we know I'm going to we're going to do what we did.
[2215.32s -> 2223.98s]  And how much do you charge? She sizes you up for a moment. Four gold pieces. Half now, half later.
[2224.54s -> 2234.46s]  That's the way we do this. Half now, half later. I'll give you up. Fine. Half now, half later,
[2234.46s -> 2241.26s]  you suggest. The woman shrugs. That's fair. She holds out a palm and you give her two gold pieces.
[2241.26s -> 2250.50s]  She smiles. Very well then. She gestures down the street. Okay. What's your name? Before we begin,
[2250.50s -> 2257.03s]  tell me your name. You can call me Mesh. She nods. It's good to meet you, stranger. This way.
[2257.21s -> 2262.12s]  She heads off along the street. I'm telling you, we're going to get clubbed in the head.
[2265.05s -> 2269.13s]  You feel the round, painful edge of a bowling pin strike the back of your skull.
[2269.77s -> 2275.74s]  I'm going to get clubbed. The alley gets wider and passing a long building on the left,
[2275.74s -> 2282.54s]  which seems to be full of children. An orphanage, Mesh tells you, full of ne'er-do-wellers.
[2282.54s -> 2291.58s]  On the step, a lanky man sits with his eyes firmly closed. Wait, isn't this the area where the people
[2291.58s -> 2303.70s]  they open their eyes? We gotta get the fuck out of here, right? Yeah, isn't this the group of
[2303.70s -> 2311.99s]  people that have the fire eyes? Yeah, we're getting out of here. Ignore. Yeah, we got a place to be.
[2311.99s -> 2315.43s]  We have a guide that's already walking. If we stop, we're going to lose the guide. We're not
[2315.43s -> 2324.92s]  stopping. We're not stopping for anything, by the way. You're back on the approach to Fireview
[2324.92s -> 2330.18s]  Square. You see that? Mesh says, pointing to the monument at the center of the square with a curious
[2330.18s -> 2335.35s]  gleam in her eye. That's one of the great treasures of Carré. If you step inside,
[2335.35s -> 2341.05s]  you're granted a vision of the whole city from above, so you can see where you need to go.
[2341.05s -> 2346.41s]  Once again, you stand in the plaza of the red eyes, the heart of this half of the city port.
[2346.41s -> 2350.89s]  In all directions, roads lead off, some no doubt to the houses of nobles and others directly into
[2350.89s -> 2355.21s]  danger. On the other side of the square, the main road continues on through a low arch.
[2355.77s -> 2361.88s]  A thousand other alleyways lead off in all directions into upper Carré. Yeah, we're not
[2361.88s -> 2374.65s]  sticking around here. Lead on. We're not doing this. Yeah, I'm going to get teleported.
[2375.53s -> 2380.12s]  No, we're just going. Lead on. You gesture for your guide to lead the way.
[2380.68s -> 2384.60s]  Through here, she says, waving towards the arch at the far side of the square.
[2385.83s -> 2399.43s]  Right? Here it comes. Here comes the- I'm going to- Are you sure? You ask, surprised by the
[2399.43s -> 2404.76s]  direction. The woman smiles. Of course I'm sure. Do you want to find the beggar or don't you?
[2411.64s -> 2414.60s]  I don't know. I don't remember. I don't remember. What is this?
[2416.73s -> 2425.19s]  I forget what this is. What is this thing? What does this do to you? Follow. You follow your guide
[2425.19s -> 2436.94s]  through the archway. You follow Miche between the narrow buildings until you reach a fork.
[2436.94s -> 2440.94s]  To the left, the road continues towards- Oh, I thought it wanted me to stand in the middle
[2440.94s -> 2445.56s]  and get- I don't know. Okay. While the right leads to the shorter street.
[2445.56s -> 2448.68s]  In the center of the fork is a great bronze statue with some kind of pot at its speed.
[2448.68s -> 2454.18s]  I remember this. Oh my. Look at how much gold there is. She steps towards the statue.
[2454.90s -> 2459.86s]  No, no, no, no. Don't do that. No, no, no. Lead on. Lead on. Don't go over there. Don't go over
[2459.86s -> 2466.22s]  there. This thing, I made a goblin go try to take money from it and cut the goblin in half.
[2466.22s -> 2470.78s]  No, no, no, no. Don't. Lead on. Don't. Do not. Let's go, you say, waving to Miche to start walking.
[2471.74s -> 2477.91s]  Of course, she says. But you can see she's looking at the base of the statue where a pot sits,
[2477.91s -> 2482.70s]  containing several gold pieces. She begins to head down the road to the right.
[2482.94s -> 2495.19s]  This way to the beggar. Is she gonna die? Was that a different statue? Oh, but this can't be
[2495.19s -> 2507.43s]  good either. Follow her. You follow her. But then at the last possible moment, she dives to one side
[2507.43s -> 2514.73s]  and grabs an armful of gold from the bowl by the statue's foot. That'll teach those moneylenders
[2514.73s -> 2521.06s]  to not pay out. She cries, stuffing nearly 20 gold pieces into her pocket. Oh, god damn it.
[2521.06s -> 2525.88s]  From somewhere behind her, there is a noise like thunder of something moving into life.
[2527.24s -> 2531.32s]  Put the money back. Put it back. We were just kidding. Yep. Yep. Yep. It was a joke.
[2532.04s -> 2539.00s]  Look for the noise. I gotta draw the sword. We can't run quickly. Put the money back.
[2539.00s -> 2543.91s]  She's an idiot. Leave her. Abandon her. No, this is a new party member.
[2547.03s -> 2554.26s]  Run, run, run. Pray to the ape. I'm pulling the sword out. You draw your sword, expecting attack.
[2554.98s -> 2561.16s]  But Miche only laughs. That won't be much good, she says, pointing behind her at the statue.
[2561.98s -> 2567.98s]  The guardian of the gold, she shouts over the noise of hissing pistons and grating metal as
[2567.98s -> 2574.73s]  the statue steps forward. Why do you think I led you here? With that, she sticks a single gold
[2574.73s -> 2580.73s]  piece into your money pouch. The statue comes for the last person to thieve. Good luck. You'll need
[2580.73s -> 2588.46s]  it. She races away but turns in the mouth of the alleyway to shout something. Here comes the club.
[2589.85s -> 2595.30s]  Listen. It's got a weak spot on one of the legs, she calls back. And to find the beggar,
[2595.30s -> 2608.12s]  you need to go to the wasteland, but beware the mill. And she blows you a kiss and rushes away.
[2608.12s -> 2619.91s]  Well, we did get some info. Oh, am I always left? Okay, you don't have time to be angry.
[2619.91s -> 2625.86s]  Looking up, you see the statue's right arm sweeping down towards you. Leap left. You jump left,
[2625.86s -> 2635.69s]  straight into the path of the club. We got clubbed. Actually got fucking clubbed. It just took
[2635.69s -> 2641.45s]  like 12 minutes to happen. Which sends you flying backwards. Picking yourself up quickly,
[2641.45s -> 2647.21s]  you see the bronze giant has leapt from its pedestal and is advancing towards you. You adjust
[2647.21s -> 2653.54s]  the grip on your sword. You rush forward, dodging the statue's stamping foot. But when your blow
[2653.54s -> 2658.18s]  lands on the metal, it only sends a painful shockwave up your arm and does no damage to
[2658.18s -> 2662.82s]  the creature at all. The statue's leaning back for another swipe at you. You'll have to find
[2662.82s -> 2669.27s]  this thing's weak spot, if it has one, or else you do not stand a chance. One of the legs.
[2671.96s -> 2675.72s]  In the milliseconds available, you scour the creature for scratches, blemishes,
[2675.72s -> 2683.50s]  as anything that might suggest a chink in the armoring. Left leg, right? You said one of the
[2683.50s -> 2696.23s]  legs. Left leg? Left leg. You race forward towards the creature's left leg and spy a small metal
[2696.23s -> 2701.35s]  plate. Twisting your sword around in your hand, you drive it into the crack and begin to lever
[2701.35s -> 2707.13s]  the panel open. The giant flails this way and that, trying to shake you loose. But you are determined,
[2707.13s -> 2713.21s]  and finally the plate flies open. A blast of hot gas ejects from the statue. It sways and then
[2713.21s -> 2722.62s]  topples face down into the street. I'm alive. You gasp with relief and take a moment to recover
[2722.62s -> 2729.85s]  your breath. You've survived, but your elven guide has disappeared. Will all the statues money?
[2730.41s -> 2737.00s]  You see, we don't care about spelling, right? Who cares? It's with all the statues. Who cares?
[2737.56s -> 2741.37s]  I told you, it's 2022. Nobody gives a shit. I know what you were trying to say. I'll just
[2741.37s -> 2748.98s]  re-say it. It's fine. I don't care. Who cares? All right. So we've got to go down here. Back to the
[2748.98s -> 2754.90s]  house. Oh, okay. So we're going to go back to the house of Vlada and then chase the gnome, right?
[2754.90s -> 2767.78s]  And then go down. Side street. Could we get there from here too? No, we definitely have to go straight
[2767.78s -> 2778.52s]  down. Uh-huh. You follow the short street towards the building with a sign that says the gambling
[2778.52s -> 2783.42s]  halls of Vlada. Lots of creatures are going in and the place seems quite busy. There's a short queue
[2783.42s -> 2790.81s]  to get in. Yeah, we have to go in and we have to chase the gnome out the back. You join the queue
[2790.81s -> 2798.66s]  and after a few minutes, you are, you are allowed inside. Yeah, guys, I'm, I'm not, I'm not, I don't
[2798.66s -> 2803.86s]  want to go to the casino. I have to go through the casino. I got to walk through the casino
[2804.42s -> 2810.44s]  and out the back door. So, I mean, I could, maybe I'll set it up. Maybe I'll put a 20 bucks in a
[2810.44s -> 2813.56s]  machine or something and that's fine. I'm just trying to, but I'm not staying here. I'm just
[2813.56s -> 2824.41s]  getting, I'm going through it. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So here we go. I'm just walking through. Uh,
[2824.49s -> 2828.44s]  give her my gold. All right. I'm just, I'm just going to play for one game.
[2829.00s -> 2841.05s]  Those of you that missed yesterday's stream, this is a casino. Uh, it is the casino in the game. So
[2842.49s -> 2850.58s]  we're, uh, I, we played yesterday and I did okay, but wait a minute. I got to hold on.
[2851.83s -> 2856.82s]  Am I going to lose my money? All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta, okay. Look at the tables
[2856.82s -> 2863.53s]  picking up. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, I can't, cause if, cause the gnome, right? No,
[2863.53s -> 2875.42s]  I don't want to do this. I'll play one game of the high wager. All right. We're going to play the,
[2876.14s -> 2882.26s]  we'll do one 10 gold bet and then we're out. Let's go. First the innkeeper. This is one,
[2882.26s -> 2896.30s]  it's 10 gold. Just one 10 gold bet. No matter. Okay. So I got, let's start with two, two threes.
[2896.30s -> 2906.89s]  No two. Uh, it's, I have literally everything. I have like a, we'll do one, two, two ones. Okay.
[2906.89s -> 2916.01s]  Three ones. That means he has to have to do four ones. Say it. Oh, you are in trouble. That means
[2916.01s -> 2921.56s]  you call it. There's no way you have three ones. I mean, see, we're just going to play. I'm going
[2921.56s -> 2939.85s]  to just sweep this guy and then we're going to get out of here. I got two, let's say two threes
[2939.85s -> 2956.06s]  because that's what I have. No two twos, two. All right. You've got two roof, two fours,
[2956.06s -> 2973.32s]  three fours. Now he's done. Call it. Thank you. You need 40 gold for that blacksmith sword.
[2973.32s -> 2985.16s]  I'll be close. Remember you're ruining this guy's family. I am not. It's look, we, that's not what's
[2985.16s -> 2995.59s]  happening. What do you mean? Why does the four confuse you so much? Because on a regular,
[2996.23s -> 3003.16s]  on a regular six sided die, the five looks like this. It has that kind of same pattern. So my
[3003.16s -> 3007.94s]  brain just keeps saying, this is a five because it's got that same, you know, the, in the middle off,
[3007.94s -> 3015.35s]  you know what I'm saying? It looks like a five on a regular six sided die. Okay. So you only,
[3015.35s -> 3019.69s]  he only has three guys. So I can really make this, I can put this guy in a lot of trouble.
[3019.69s -> 3037.24s]  I'm going to say two ones. No two twos. Let's really just ruin it. Two threes. Okay. I'm going
[3037.24s -> 3043.46s]  to say four. Let's do this because the chances of him having one of these are pretty high. Call it.
[3043.46s -> 3055.05s]  You definitely have one. You have to have one. Yeah. You definitely have one. Whatever. Oh,
[3057.91s -> 3070.17s]  oh really? One? I think there are two twos. Oh, well that's interesting. I think there are three
[3070.17s -> 3082.73s]  ones. Call it. Yeah. Sorry. That's a, that's a horrible, horrible hand to have against you.
[3082.73s -> 3091.00s]  You lose. Stupid. I'm just kidding. Damn. That's another good one. All right. So let's do
[3091.56s -> 3112.90s]  two twos again. Two threes. Fine. Hmm. How many, he has two die, which means he probably has one.
[3112.90s -> 3121.50s]  So if I, if I have to call this and it's wrong, right. Okay. So that's assuming that he's saying
[3121.50s -> 3143.98s]  that he has doubles, which no way. All right. All right. That, that was unlucky. One, three,
[3143.98s -> 3163.56s]  two threes. Don't call it. Yep. I win. All right. And then we cash out and then we get out of here.
[3163.56s -> 3173.99s]  Uh, there was one, one, one, one, two. I think that there, there's two twos. Two is probably
[3173.99s -> 3182.20s]  the only thing he has. Three twos. I'm sorry, buddy. What? Oh fuck. Wait a minute. I didn't,
[3182.20s -> 3189.05s]  I didn't know I had two twos. I thought I only had one. I thought I didn't know that was a two.
[3189.05s -> 3196.46s]  I didn't, my brain just didn't make that a two. I thought I only had one two. I have to call it.
[3197.45s -> 3209.61s]  Cause I mean, no, I got caught here. I just have to hope he doesn't have it. I could just bluff it,
[3209.61s -> 3215.61s]  but that's impossible. Cause he'd, he'd have to call it anyways. I got to see if he's bluffing.
[3215.61s -> 3219.85s]  No, he wasn't. I, that was my fault. I actually didn't, um, realize I had that.
[3219.85s -> 3235.62s]  All right. What do you got? One, one, one, three. I, I pretty much have guaranteed to win this too.
[3235.62s -> 3238.66s]  Yeah. I'm guaranteed there's not, when you have one die versus two die, you,
[3238.74s -> 3249.42s]  it's almost impossible to win. There we go. All right. 10 chips. Change. Get out. I'm done.
[3249.42s -> 3270.39s]  Cash it out. Cash out. Bang. 26. Okay. So wait, how do, how do I get to the ruins?
[3270.39s -> 3285.93s]  Down here and up? Okay. I'm not, I'm not fucking with the statue again. So I have to go,
[3285.93s -> 3299.98s]  how do I get over there? Could I go up and then this way? Let's find out up and left. I think.
[3299.98s -> 3307.27s]  Yeah. Uh, leave the square. Yeah. There we go. Okay. Cool. Let's go in the alley.
[3307.67s -> 3312.86s]  Do you like flour or corn tortillas? Well, that's a very loaded question because it depends on what's
[3312.86s -> 3318.78s]  in them. Corn tortillas are good for, uh, carne asada. I love like a carne asada and a corn
[3318.78s -> 3327.02s]  tortilla and fold it up nice and small. Pick it up. Just a flour tortilla is great for burritos.
[3327.02s -> 3331.74s]  Um, yeah. Okay. You choose a random alleyway on the right hand side of the square and slip
[3331.74s -> 3337.69s]  into the shadow between the tall buildings. The houses either side are well built and well defended.
[3337.69s -> 3344.41s]  There are iron railings on the windows and some even have arrow slits and portcullises. One
[3344.41s -> 3350.47s]  household has a dug, a moat across its front door. Outside one building, a tall man stands with a
[3350.47s -> 3361.72s]  grappling hook. Okay. You hang back and watch as he swings his grappling hook twice aiming for one
[3361.72s -> 3368.55s]  of the windows on the floor above. The hook misses and clatters to the street below and the man curses
[3368.55s -> 3376.07s]  before gathering up the rope for another try. Approach him. It's Batman. You stride over to
[3376.07s -> 3383.27s]  the man as he swings his hook once more. Greetings. You begin with a respectful nod. The man turns to
[3383.27s -> 3390.47s]  you. Stranger, I'm in a terrible fix. The man gathers the rope for another swing. He's clearly
[3390.47s -> 3400.81s]  tiring. Uh, what's the problem? I've been locked out. This is my home and I've lost my key but I've
[3400.81s -> 3409.62s]  got a terrible throw as you can probably see. The man throws again and misses again. Um, where'd you
[3409.62s -> 3415.69s]  get the grappling hook? How would you believe it? I found it near an old well in the wasteland.
[3415.69s -> 3430.17s]  I was wandering about there feeling sorry for myself and I chanced across it. Bullshit. You a
[3430.17s -> 3441.61s]  thief? Are you a guard? Answer the question. You reply coolly. Listen, if I were a thief,
[3442.65s -> 3446.81s]  do you not suppose I would be better at getting this accursed thing to land on the sill?
[3446.81s -> 3452.02s]  To demonstrate his point, he swings again with considerable effort and once more misses,
[3452.02s -> 3457.30s]  ducking to one side to avoid the look at he as the ducking to avoid the hook as it falls back.
[3458.92s -> 3463.91s]  The man gives up. He winds up the rope around his shoulder and then cups his hand to his mouth.
[3463.91s -> 3470.30s]  Ask me, will you just open the door and let me in? For a moment, nothing happens. Then a bucket of
[3470.30s -> 3479.78s]  slop is thrown out over the man. He stands dripping in muck. Who is that? You ask from a safe distance
[3479.78s -> 3486.84s]  away. Take my advice, stranger. Never marry an elephant. They may have lovely eyes. They are
[3486.84s -> 3498.79s]  thoroughly untrustworthy. He stalks away up the alley. Time for you to move. Well, we failed that,
[3498.79s -> 3512.44s]  whatever that was. Okay, along the alley. Well, I don't know, the guy's out there with a grappling
[3512.44s -> 3516.28s]  hook thrown at random windows. But am I going to trust this guy? Hey, yes, let me see that. I'll do
[3516.28s -> 3521.86s]  it. And then I go, shoot the grappling hook out into the window, break the window and the guards
[3521.86s -> 3527.54s]  come and club me in the back of the fucking head. We've seen that song and dance too many times.
[3527.54s -> 3535.18s]  The street is falling into disrepair around you. Something has blighted this region of the city.
[3535.18s -> 3539.18s]  Even the trees and the gardens behind the mansions have turned black where they stand.
[3539.18s -> 3544.66s]  The only greenery is the moss on the stone walls. There are no rats scurrying underfoot
[3544.66s -> 3550.62s]  and only spiders roost in the rooftops. You pass a particularly grand house. It's doors locked with
[3550.62s -> 3561.83s]  a heavy iron chain. Look at it. There is a metal S bolted beneath one gable. Perhaps it's an owner's
[3561.83s -> 3567.37s]  mark. Perhaps it is there to stop the wall falling out onto the street. There's a ringing noise from
[3567.37s -> 3573.62s]  down the alley. A hooded creature with a bell around his neck is approaching in shuffling steps.
[3573.62s -> 3599.32s]  Oh boy. We could open, we could open the door. Doc? Oh no, I don't have any more. There's always Jig.
[3599.32s -> 3618.63s]  But we don't know what this is. I could do Sos. Why is it lowercase and uppercase? There's the
[3618.63s -> 3628.78s]  different spells. So capital D-O-P is open doors, but lowercase D-O-C, like lowercase D is um,
[3628.78s -> 3641.78s]  a different spell. I don't know. It's a spell. Who knows? Uh, it's either Jig or Sos. Let's do Sos.
[3642.87s -> 3646.47s]  Or Sap. Sos is probably better. Because what if it's not a danger?
[3647.19s -> 3655.16s]  Sense danger. You cast a spell and a calm voice enters your mind. It tells you that the house
[3655.16s -> 3660.60s]  before you is empty of anything important, even of ghosts, but that the creature approaching is
[3660.60s -> 3670.60s]  quite deadly and the voice fades away. Um, you want to scurry into the house? I could do another one.
[3670.60s -> 3689.82s]  You cast the spell pulling out your little flute and playing a merry tune. The figure in the cloak
[3689.82s -> 3697.54s]  stops suddenly and then in awkward and painful steps begins to dance. The sight is macabre
[3697.54s -> 3705.08s]  and cruel. And you hear the creature wheezing with the effort of every movement. Oh no,
[3705.08s -> 3714.73s]  this is like bad. Keep playing? It said that the creature was deadly. Does that mean that
[3714.73s -> 3725.21s]  they were going to attack or they're just actually, I don't know. Keep playing? You show no mercy.
[3725.21s -> 3730.89s]  Continuing the spell until the creature is quite exhausted, it begins to scream in a human voice
[3730.89s -> 3735.90s]  from its terrible injuries. When the enchantment finally fades, the creature can barely find the
[3735.90s -> 3740.94s]  strength to crawl away. The creature with the bell around its neck passes you without looking
[3740.94s -> 3768.60s]  up and shuffles away. Okay. But Suss said that the creature was dangerous. Open the door? Do it
[3768.60s -> 3777.69s]  again. It doesn't cost anything. You cast the spell pulling out your little flute and playing
[3777.69s -> 3782.09s]  a merry tune. The sound is cheery on the desolate street. Nothing more occurs. Now the creature's
[3782.09s -> 3787.67s]  gone. Let's go to the house. The door to the house is locked with a heavy padlock chain. You can try
[3787.67s -> 3801.19s]  to pry it open with the tip of your sword, but achieve nothing. Let's dop it open. Open locks
[3801.19s -> 3810.76s]  and doors. You cast the spell over the heavy chain and it tumbles to the ground and to the house.
[3811.32s -> 3819.59s]  You slip through the wide doors into the old empty house, an empty mansion. You push open the doors
[3819.59s -> 3825.05s]  and step inside the dark house. It is a mansion on a grand scale, larger even than the abandoned
[3825.05s -> 3830.68s]  house you explored on the lower side of Carré. There are at least three floors and two great
[3830.68s -> 3835.78s]  doors leading off to wings on either side of the entrance hall. From the back of the house comes
[3835.78s -> 3853.24s]  a voice. The Lord is not home. I know. That's why I'm here. I know. The figure shambles forward,
[3853.24s -> 3859.88s]  resolving itself out of the darkness into a tall ogre wearing the livery of a manservant.
[3859.88s -> 3874.10s]  His eyes are tightly closed. Lord Shinva is not at home. Please leave. Lord Shinva is dead.
[3874.10s -> 3886.95s]  Yeah, Sus said there wasn't anybody in here. Lord Shinva is dead, isn't he? Indeed. He will not be
[3886.95s -> 3899.13s]  returning for some time. Returning? Is he not dead? Not so dead that he might not yet be revived,
[3899.13s -> 3905.66s]  but I hold out very little hope. My service will continue regardless, of course. As he speaks,
[3905.66s -> 3910.94s]  you notice a flash of metal from his neck, some kind of collar made of a strange dull colored
[3910.94s -> 3917.56s]  metal, and the collar is covered up by his shirt. I must now ask you to step outside,
[3917.56s -> 3933.96s]  gesturing towards the door. Should I just try? What do I do? I don't know. What do I do about it?
[3933.96s -> 3939.46s]  Push past? Push past the creature. You elbow past the creature, meaning to explore the house.
[3939.46s -> 3944.50s]  In return, the creature opens his eyes, and a searing red flash burns your arm.
[3944.50s -> 3950.95s]  I regret to inform you that I am part red-eye. Then he grabs you by the burnt arm and hauls you
[3950.95s -> 3955.67s]  out of the house onto the street. The creature with the bell has gone. A narrow alley opens up
[3955.67s -> 3969.06s]  to your left, slipping between the buildings. God damn it. That's bullshit. Rewind. Rewind.
[3970.50s -> 3981.18s]  I can't. Dude, just start killing everybody. No, I can't just kill everybody. Remember Corga?
[3981.18s -> 3998.66s]  Corga hated us. Um, I'm gonna go down this way, because we didn't explore this. I wonder,
[3998.66s -> 4009.03s]  I wonder where the beggar would be. Down here, maybe? Who cares about Corga? I don't know. Um,
[4009.03s -> 4017.74s]  I'll stay on the road. The buildings are thinning out, through a gap between roofs you can make out
[4017.74s -> 4023.54s]  a tall, crooked steeple some way away, like a finger pointing up towards the heavens. A dark
[4023.54s -> 4031.72s]  shape sits at its very tip. As you watch, the shape seems to grow wide, then flatten once more,
[4031.72s -> 4037.40s]  as though it had opened and closed. A bird, perhaps? Or simply a flag, draping downwards
[4037.40s -> 4049.16s]  in the still air. Okay, we're looking for theta. We need the spell line. Once again, you're
[4049.16s -> 4054.46s]  emerging from the alley into a wide area of wasteland. Once, this was a busy city district,
[4054.46s -> 4060.52s]  but now it looks as though a hurricane has leveled it. Nothing stands higher than head height. A few
[4060.52s -> 4066.25s]  staircases lead to nowhere, and in some places a door still stands. Plants grow from every crevice
[4066.25s -> 4071.14s]  and crack as though someone had poured green paint over the whole scene. Things are constantly
[4071.14s -> 4078.07s]  moving and shuffling between the leaves. The road, such as it is, is quickly smothered by
[4078.07s -> 4083.30s]  piles of wreckage. There are lots of other ways to pick your way through. One possible route leads
[4083.30s -> 4088.22s]  up and over the side of a broken down house. Another passes by what might have once been a mill.
[4088.22s -> 4094.58s]  You would have to climb over the mill wheel to continue this way. We were told to avoid the mill.
[4094.58s -> 4108.84s]  Didn't somebody say, don't go near the mill? That was the guide, right? Yeah, they said,
[4109.48s -> 4118.36s]  go to the mill. Did they lie? Yeah, while she was running away she was like, don't go to the mill,
[4118.36s -> 4126.41s]  you're gonna get fucked up. Something like that. Look at the broken house. The house has been sliced
[4126.41s -> 4131.42s]  like a many layered cake, showing the floors that were once inside. Opened rooms have been
[4131.42s -> 4135.58s]  stripped of their color by the wind and light, and of their possessions by a decade or more
[4135.58s -> 4140.44s]  of scavengers. But there's still hints that this place was once a family home. The hooks in the
[4140.44s -> 4145.32s]  ceiling above the hearth, the marks notched on a ground floor pillar, that suggest the height of a
[4145.32s -> 4162.55s]  growing child. Children. Height of growing children. I'm gonna climb the house. Look at the mill.
[4162.55s -> 4168.26s]  Who would build a mill out here so far from the river? Still, there is a gigantic mill wheel
[4168.26s -> 4173.03s]  lying on its side in the path. Despite the state that the building next to it is in, the wheel
[4173.03s -> 4181.51s]  itself seems perfectly intact and has not even lost its perfect circular shape. Um, we were
[4181.51s -> 4194.63s]  specifically told to avoid the mill. So, um, oh it's a portal trap! That's right! That's right,
[4194.63s -> 4201.38s]  a perfect circle on the ground. Climb the broken house. You clamor up the fallen rubble to the
[4201.38s -> 4206.17s]  roof of the broken building. From here you get a clear view across the rest of the wasteland.
[4206.17s -> 4212.31s]  It stretches for a mile or two and will take about an hour to cross on foot. And at its far side,
[4212.31s -> 4217.22s]  a tall iron fence thick with ivy slices across the land. Perhaps to keep the people of the
[4217.22s -> 4223.93s]  wasteland out, or to keep whatever is beyond the fence in. In the distance you see dark shapes
[4223.93s -> 4228.84s]  moving across the sky. Climb down the other side of the house. You make your way down the far side
[4228.84s -> 4234.63s]  of the building and look back onto the path, which soon forks. All right, this is actually
[4234.63s -> 4243.14s]  really important because I don't know where this with where this person is. Lord Theda is in the
[4243.14s -> 4248.57s]  ruins. Lord Theda can be found blind and begging in the ruins of the fallen quarter of the city.
[4248.57s -> 4269.59s]  He's a beggar. I don't know, just said he's in the ruins. Does anybody, nobody told us where.
[4281.90s -> 4294.58s]  He could be anywhere. Let's try right. Okay, you follow the path to the right between broken
[4294.58s -> 4300.57s]  foundations and cracked streets. On one side a roof sticks half out of a sand dune. On the other,
[4300.57s -> 4305.21s]  front door lies flat on the ground as though leading to a hidden cellar. Then the path comes
[4305.21s -> 4310.47s]  to a building that amidst all this destruction is still standing. Its door is closed and its
[4310.47s -> 4317.96s]  stone walls seem completely intact. You try the door and find that it falls open at the slightest
[4317.96s -> 4328.42s]  touch. Go in the house. You might be in the house. The house consists of a single room with a large
[4328.42s -> 4335.77s]  table and a large chair and in the far corner a sealed box. Everything seems in good repair.
[4335.77s -> 4341.88s]  The wood looks waxed and polished and the hinges on the box are free of rust. Is it a mimic chest?
[4341.88s -> 4346.98s]  I don't know. From the doorway you stop and look around and that's when you notice the
[4346.98s -> 4358.79s]  foot sticking out from under the table. Look at the foot. You go over to look at the foot.
[4358.79s -> 4366.23s]  It is clawed and a dull shade of gray green. It is about the size of your head and sticks out from
[4366.23s -> 4375.24s]  under the low table. This house feels dead. Even the air inside seems not to move. Did I just kick
[4375.24s -> 4382.06s]  the foot? All right, I'm gonna, I'm gonna fraud the foot. Reaching forward with the walking cane
[4382.06s -> 4392.79s]  you found in the house. The one opportunity to use the cane is here. I take the cane out and go
[4392.79s -> 4401.45s]  poke poke. That's the only thing the cane has been used for. Nothing happens. All right, poke it again.
[4401.45s -> 4406.18s]  Feeling more confident now? You brought it once more. Still nothing. Seems like this creature is
[4406.18s -> 4415.67s]  either very asleep or very dead. Okay, go for the box. No longer concerned about the creature,
[4415.67s -> 4420.87s]  you head over to the box and lift the lid. Inside are a series of small round stones.
[4420.87s -> 4428.62s]  Carefully carved. Lift out a stone. You pick out one of the stones at random and lift it from the
[4428.62s -> 4435.75s]  box. It isn't heavy but it is exquisitely smooth. Not quite round with a dimple at the top and a
[4435.75s -> 4440.86s]  deeper pit near the top. In fact, you realize as you turn it over in your hand it is carved in the
[4440.86s -> 4447.50s]  shape of an apple. Looking in the box you see other carved food stuffs. Apples, bread rolls,
[4447.50s -> 4453.88s]  goat's cheese, a ham. Each has been almost perfectly chiseled into a shape. This is the
[4453.88s -> 4461.46s]  kit at the fair. You search through the box hoping to find something of value or else something to
[4461.46s -> 4466.36s]  explain the purpose of the collection but you discover nothing more. Turning away your eyes
[4466.36s -> 4471.66s]  fall on the other side of the table where the head of the creature lies. The face is clearly
[4471.66s -> 4479.78s]  stoned. The eyes are stone. The open mouth is stone. It is a statue of a spin or else it once
[4479.78s -> 4491.70s]  was a spin. In its hand you see it holds a stone shovel. You peer at the shovel. It is a wide blade.
[4491.70s -> 4497.51s]  Good for heavy digging. This creature was a gardener, perhaps or a farmer, or more likely given his
[4497.51s -> 4503.98s]  lonely outpost near the necropolis, the city gravedigger. But now he is solid stone. Such
[4503.98s -> 4509.74s]  things are not impossible. Perhaps he buried a wizard's lover. A day too soon, perhaps.
[4509.74s -> 4518.52s]  You step back outside into the dying sunlight. Interesting. I wonder what you could do there.
[4518.52s -> 4526.54s]  You make your way between blasted walls and weed encrusted rubble. There is a constant movement in
[4526.54s -> 4532.42s]  the corner of your eyes. Rats scurrying to hide under the stones and the cracks. The path turns
[4532.42s -> 4536.90s]  around a large stone fountain which has toppled over on one side revealing an empty well
[4536.90s -> 4544.84s]  leading down into the earth. We don't- I don't want to go in the sewer. Move on. I'm not going
[4544.84s -> 4556.81s]  in the sewer. All right the edge of the wasteland. Did we miss it? Oh hold on. After a while another
[4556.81s -> 4562.50s]  path joins this one. Looking back along it you see a toppled steeple. A track climbs the rise at your
[4562.50s -> 4567.83s]  back towards a low hovel. This is the far end of the wasteland ahead you make out a line of tall
[4567.83s -> 4582.68s]  dark trees. Okay I'm gonna say the hovel. So hey do all your jokes come from this game? I'd say like
[4582.68s -> 4590.23s]  maybe 10% of all the jokes I've ever made. Maybe maybe like seven maybe seven percent of everything
[4590.23s -> 4595.48s]  I've ever said has been directly from the text of this game. No maybe like four percent of everything
[4595.48s -> 4606.10s]  I've ever said. Such as? I don't know. I made it up. I don't know. It's not even true. All right you
[4606.10s -> 4611.56s]  climb the rise towards the hovel. It is merely a tent pitched into clearing. Guy ropes held down
[4611.56s -> 4619.02s]  by rubble. You stand and hold your breath but you hear nothing from inside. Perhaps it is unoccupied.
[4619.02s -> 4627.80s]  Certainly it can't contain much. It's going. Aha! Did we find him? You step into the shade of the
[4627.80s -> 4635.46s]  tiny hovel and your eyes widen. The room inside is lined floor to ceiling with trinkets, knickknacks,
[4635.46s -> 4641.10s]  brick-a-brack, and other miscellaneous stuff. Some is piled up on the shelves. Some hang from the
[4641.10s -> 4646.82s]  ceiling. Even more lean against the walls. There are weapons, pottery, jewelry, domestic objects,
[4646.82s -> 4659.77s]  magical items, and so on. Oh it's not the right person. Who is this? Sitting cross-legged on the
[4659.77s -> 4664.33s]  floor in the midst of all this mess is a small bearded gnome who rubs his hands and greets you
[4664.33s -> 4695.06s]  as you come in. I have come to rob you. You know what? You know what I'm saying? Should I? I've come
[4695.06s -> 4702.34s]  to rob you. I've come to rob you. You announce. Amazed that no one has done it already since he
[4702.34s -> 4708.62s]  lives out here clearly undefended. Very well. As you can see I can't stop you. But you wouldn't
[4708.62s -> 4719.18s]  rather trade. I'll trade your life for what you own. Trade would be acceptable. Imagine like hey
[4719.75s -> 4725.08s]  this is a stick-up this is a robbery oh but I mean we could trade too yeah yeah you know that's
[4725.08s -> 4734.47s]  works I I'm more into that you're right yeah that's acceptable to me taking mercy on the
[4734.47s -> 4741.06s]  tiny scrawny creature oh good I'm very glad to hear that as you might imagine he pats the ground
[4741.06s -> 4746.79s]  beside him let's see if we can do a little bartering as you can probably tell I have no
[4746.79s -> 4752.98s]  interest in money the gnome gestures around his little room there's clearly a lot to choose from
[4752.98s -> 4758.34s]  but the items which stand out are a pot of beeswax a bag of goblin's teeth and a compass
[4758.34s -> 4764.25s]  whose needle quivers in a direction which is close to but not actually north what would you
[4764.25s -> 4775.22s]  like no mast I don't want any more teeth what's the compass it's not a normal compass instead
[4775.22s -> 4781.24s]  it'll point you to where it thinks you need to go I'm afraid it has a mind of its own and it isn't
[4781.24s -> 4787.78s]  always correct and it probably won't work in the countryside outside of Kare either so I'd understand
[4787.78s -> 4810.30s]  if you don't want it um well we're but we're like on our way out of Kare it's Jack Sparrow's compass
[4810.30s -> 4820.84s]  it's not that's not gonna do anything honestly it's not gonna work I don't need any more teeth
[4820.84s -> 4829.02s]  I could use the beeswax he said it's not gonna work outside Kare we're at the end of our Kare
[4829.02s -> 4842.20s]  journey very soon here teeth or we riot you could be lying all right I'll take the compass
[4842.20s -> 4852.39s]  sounds intriguing you reply not putting the compass down anything else um do I have beeswax
[4852.39s -> 4869.35s]  oh no okay I have beeswax yeah guys I have eight goblin teeth I don't need any more um no that's
[4869.35s -> 4877.30s]  enough you say standing back all done very good you took one of mine so I've taken one thing of
[4877.30s -> 4883.86s]  yours I'm very quick you probably didn't notice me doing it good day the gnome gestures towards
[4883.86s -> 4891.77s]  the door for you to leave wait what did he take what did you take the gnome looks surprised well
[4891.77s -> 4898.01s]  really I have no idea I'm a kleptomaniac that should be fairly obvious and what's more I couldn't
[4898.01s -> 4902.97s]  see into your pack when I was taking it could I but I'm very fair and I took exactly the right
[4902.97s -> 4920.17s]  amount of things so we're all square what did he take what did he take am I missing something
[4920.17s -> 4934.39s]  skull cap wig bone sun jewel badge of the noble 26 gold tinderbox walking cane what did I what
[4934.39s -> 4947.29s]  did he take he took the chain he took the silver chain he took the flute no he took the chain he
[4947.29s -> 4957.37s]  took my silver chain a magical silver chain that acts like a snake for a fucking dumb ass broken
[4958.33s -> 4975.51s]  I'm attacking this guy give me my stuff I'm sorry that's really quite impossible
[4975.51s -> 4980.39s]  I don't know where I put it or what it is you should be pleased with what you stole from me
[4980.39s -> 4984.87s]  and be on your way oh that's why he's got all this shit because he didn't he doesn't even know what
[4984.87s -> 4993.50s]  it is take something I just start grabbing stuff no no no no no no that's not I actually probably
[4993.50s -> 4997.98s]  should get out of here because if I take something if I just start grabbing shit he's going to grab
[4997.98s -> 5003.06s]  stuff from me and be like well you took something of mine so I took something of yours I wonder if
[5003.38s -> 5013.03s]  should I just attack him threaten him give me my things or I'll squeeze you to death for a moment
[5013.03s -> 5021.43s]  you seem to see something move in the corner of your eye look here I can't help it and in all this
[5021.43s -> 5027.32s]  talking about it I've gone and stolen something else from you so really I do advise you to just
[5027.32s -> 5034.09s]  leave kill this might kill him you give into your worst intentions and strangle the gnome where
[5034.09s -> 5047.21s]  he stands but with him dead you'll never find your property you search of the you do a search
[5047.21s -> 5052.25s]  of the hut but nothing turns up while all the time outside the sun is setting eventually you
[5052.25s -> 5057.05s]  give and you head out of the hubble you return back along the path what the fuck hold on what
[5057.05s -> 5074.79s]  else did I just strangled him to death what did he take oh he took the wig no I need that
[5076.66s -> 5082.34s]  I genuinely need that wig I need it I genuinely need that that's the thing that lets me talk to
[5082.34s -> 5091.11s]  animals are you not gonna let me rewind that well and by the way why did I put my hands around his
[5091.11s -> 5098.02s]  neck I strangled him to death why wouldn't I just kill him with my sword why would I choke him to
[5098.02s -> 5105.82s]  death and put my bare hands around his neck and squeeze him to wait did I say that I did say that
[5105.82s -> 5115.88s]  didn't I give me my things or I'll squeeze you to death why was I in the mood to strangle someone
[5115.88s -> 5122.15s]  I have swords and magical spells and why I don't need to strangle someone there's no reason for
[5122.15s -> 5131.66s]  this I have magic I have lightning bolts and I run a poll can I rewind and just fuck this place
[5131.66s -> 5141.99s]  and literally just not even go in here it's got to be at least 75% yes can I rewind or do we lose
[5141.99s -> 5159.88s]  two items for no reason you have to live with my decision it's got to be at least 75% that's what
[5160.04s -> 5167.70s]  you get it's a free rewind I know re-winding is I know it's polarizing I know right do you live
[5167.70s -> 5172.34s]  with your decisions and just take it as the game goes or do you no no no my finger was still there
[5172.34s -> 5177.30s]  so I could still do it I think there's an equal amount of both that make the game fun right because
[5177.30s -> 5180.34s]  there's been a lot of cases where I have not rewound it's like no we gotta fucking live with
[5180.34s -> 5190.39s]  that it is fun though to play this game uh and you have to live with every decision although
[5190.39s -> 5198.25s]  it's really hard to win I will say it's very difficult to win the game without doing it all
[5198.25s -> 5208.79s]  right let's go back uh we're just should I do what I did to get the compass and he takes the
[5208.79s -> 5217.06s]  chain right wait wait it might be random though maybe I just don't even do this what is I'm gonna
[5217.06s -> 5233.78s]  leave I'm not going in here no don't even bother okay uh we're going to the steeple chat's a bunch
[5233.78s -> 5243.69s]  of rewind Andes hey by the way we got him this is definitely him you make your way through the
[5243.77s -> 5249.05s]  wasteland towards the church most of the building is in ruins but a tall steeple still reaches for
[5249.05s -> 5254.92s]  the sky circling the steeple are two dark shapes that look like enormous birds at the foot of the
[5254.92s -> 5265.66s]  church a man dressed in rags is curled up asleep look at him you stop and peer down to look at him
[5265.66s -> 5273.08s]  could this be theta the blind beggar that you were told to find his face is curiously familiar
[5273.08s -> 5278.30s]  you've definitely seen it somewhere before since you arrived in care although you have not seen
[5278.30s -> 5287.53s]  any other beggars as filthy and smelly as this one is this the guy from the very beginning we
[5287.53s -> 5293.58s]  could have killed this person from in the beginning thomas yeah well I think we could have actually
[5293.58s -> 5301.72s]  killed this guy uh let's wake him you reach down and wake him gently at first he doesn't respond
[5301.72s -> 5309.22s]  and you wonder if you are too late but then he sits up sharply who's there I'm under attack I'm
[5309.22s -> 5316.26s]  under attack he rubs his eyes then reaches out with a dirty fingertip to your face um all right
[5316.26s -> 5321.42s]  let's take let's take it let's take it slow one voice andy no sorry it's andy one voice get it
[5321.42s -> 5334.17s]  right or don't even say it um wait wait okay well should I give him something introduce myself
[5334.17s -> 5341.19s]  greetings you say the beggar groans and grumbles what did you wake me for I can see in my dreams
[5341.19s -> 5353.98s]  you know I maybe that joke from the first game for the first time you played I'd rather stay there
[5353.98s -> 5365.13s]  you are theta noble of care do I jump this on him immediately you are theta noble of care
[5365.13s -> 5372.78s]  you round on the beggar you are theta seventh noble of care are you not the man looks absolutely
[5372.78s -> 5378.62s]  terrified by the accusation he begins to curl up around himself and scream it seems quite a
[5378.62s -> 5385.70s]  strong reaction then you see he is not looking at you but past you oh shit look up you turn
[5385.70s -> 5391.46s]  your attention skywards to see the two dark shapes are hurtling downwards beating wide leathery wings
[5391.46s -> 5397.91s]  they're the creatures you saw flying around the steeple god cursed harpies they come for me every
[5397.91s -> 5403.83s]  time every coin I get every apple every stinking crust of bread they come and they take it from me
[5403.83s -> 5411.59s]  what did I do to deserve such torment step in front of the beggar you push the beggar back and
[5411.59s -> 5425.88s]  stare up into the sky terrifying looking the harpies are screaming down towards him ugly
[5425.88s -> 5430.44s]  dark-skinned creatures with sharp talons and their arms and legs coming to tear out what's
[5430.44s -> 5452.79s]  left of his let's go okay this is important I don't have a pebble shield can I do cats
[5453.88s -> 5468.01s]  what would cats do I could do giant giant would help gob we got I got plenty of goblin teeth
[5468.87s -> 5479.32s]  I got eight of these let's get a goblin friend you toss a goblin's tooth into the ground and
[5479.32s -> 5484.36s]  cast the spell a plume of smoke forms and then moment later a goblin warrior stands in front of
[5484.36s -> 5491.26s]  you the beggar begins to shriek and scrabble back through the dust no what why would it do
[5491.26s -> 5497.06s]  turn the goblin on the harpies you turn the goblin about to attack the harpies the short
[5497.06s -> 5503.14s]  creature jumps up and down trying to stab the flying monsters but they cackle and laugh before
[5503.14s -> 5508.50s]  one finally snatches your little warrior into the air they lift him high well above the ruined
[5508.50s -> 5514.26s]  steeple then let go thankfully the enchantment that has created him breaks before his body hits
[5514.26s -> 5530.42s]  the ground and he simply vanishes in mid-air they're so fucking useless you know what gob
[5530.42s -> 5538.62s]  is really good to test stuff right you go first sending a goblin into a room and they just get
[5538.62s -> 5542.54s]  like instantly killed by a trap and then you just walk around it that's we've done that a few times
[5543.74s -> 5550.57s]  uh there's such dog shit though this is so bad at everything else all right they come
[5550.57s -> 5554.17s]  screaming for your neck uh they only got five stamina though so I'm gonna go full blaster
[5555.42s -> 5563.03s]  got it it flexes its long talons as it turns in the air once more it's still fighting all right
[5563.03s -> 5571.59s]  I gotta hold back I think you think he'll go more than five yeah he will oh come what the
[5571.59s -> 5581.90s]  fuck was that 0.1 look out they never give up these harpies they never give up full blast
[5582.94s -> 5587.26s]  oh that's fucking that's awful that's truly bad I might have to do I'm gonna do it again
[5587.90s -> 5603.06s]  that's actually terrible the beggar holds onto his hat as his head and the creature swoops low fuck
[5603.06s -> 5641.86s]  I'm dead oh my god this stupid thing it's over it's still defending I oh I can't hit it okay

[5679.02s -> 5693.11s]  gonna defend it circles out of reach defend again it flies up to the roof of the old building okay
[5693.11s -> 5709.26s]  defend again it wheels high into the air screaming to the other what what the fuck I thought it was
[5709.26s -> 5713.18s]  high in the air I didn't know he was down what it said he was goes high into the air
[5713.66s -> 5726.26s]  the harpy's eyes are on fire yeah come in 6.5 that's a huge that's a huge hit huge huge hit

[5741.83s -> 5746.79s]  what's happening demands the beggar but you order him to silence as an opening appears you cut a
[5746.79s -> 5753.24s]  side blow the harpy hits the ground it is a huge creature as big as a bear but the savage light in
[5753.24s -> 5758.23s]  its eyes has gone dark the beggar darts forward to jab it with his stick but there's no time for
[5758.23s -> 5763.88s]  celebration the second creature is already searing down from the sky oh god damn it this is such a
[5763.88s -> 5782.89s]  this the ape thank god for the ape this one has a much bigger stamina pool I gotta defend yep that
[5782.89s -> 5795.24s]  was a good play don't let him get you yeah thanks okay you just used a whole bar I'm gonna go like
[5795.24s -> 5801.00s]  the creature hovers just a little out of reach this is a defense scenario right or just a little bit
[5801.08s -> 5812.15s]  like 1.2.0 okay it wheels up and turns about ready to strike look out he's going for your head
[5812.79s -> 5820.81s]  eight got him okay now we pull back because he's coming in with like probably like a five or six
[5821.37s -> 5828.10s]  I could have done it but sorry I got a bigger stamina pool now it hangs in the air a short way

[5854.79s -> 5860.74s]  final turn through the air the harpy barrels over then tumbles striking the side of the church as
[5860.74s -> 5865.86s]  it hits the ground a wall collapses and the creature is buried beneath a slide of masonry
[5865.86s -> 5873.00s]  the beggar cheers it begins to dance all right well I'm glad we got a goblin like just like
[5873.00s -> 5878.42s]  snatched up and dropped the beggar creeps out from his hiding place and thanks you two or three

[5927.78s -> 5933.21s]  to the sound of you rummaging through your things finally you produce the badge and place it into
[5933.21s -> 5942.82s]  his hand he smiles as he accepts it my stranger thank you but he feels over the surface trying
[5942.82s -> 5949.21s]  to work out the shape then suddenly he drops it as though it were scolding hot that's not mine
[5950.33s -> 5957.78s]  not anymore I wish I'd never taken it in the first place I won't take it again he kicks at the badge
[5957.78s -> 5966.97s]  and skitters away into the debris of the fallen church talk to him lord theta I'd like to talk

[5976.39s -> 5983.77s]  blindness struck me down I've been tormented by those demons and now they're dead you've saved me
[5983.77s -> 5993.80s]  or as much as I can be saved that's his cane dude we are ready for this conversation by the way
[5993.80s -> 5998.66s]  this is the most prepared I think I've ever been for this conversation give him his walking cane
[5998.66s -> 6005.67s]  here I have something for you you take his outstretched hand and place the walking cane
[6006.39s -> 6013.37s]  into his grip his fingers find its familiar shape and he leans quickly onto it with a sigh
[6013.37s -> 6020.09s]  my old friend this saw me through the worst times when my eyes were failing I hardly need it now of
[6020.09s -> 6026.14s]  course to demonstrate he spins around on the spot gets his legs into a tangle and sits down
[6026.14s -> 6036.74s]  sharply laughing but thank you stranger you are indeed kind the beggar shivers against a sudden
[6036.74s -> 6043.35s]  breath of cold the afternoon is waning evening is approaching already days are growing shorter
[6043.35s -> 6052.10s]  it's like that here near the backlands tell me your spell line for the gate just cut right to
[6052.10s -> 6067.69s]  the chase that was a willy wonka moment tell me your spell line for the gate please happily

[6113.53s -> 6121.02s]  remember the rest of the line he shakes his head it's gone I fear it's gone like my sight
[6121.02s -> 6127.26s]  it was the name of a god one of the old gods the god of pride no less and maybe you can find out
[6127.26s -> 6133.77s]  elsewhere you could ask corga the god of grace for his health he lives in a temple that way
[6133.77s -> 6150.20s]  he waves roughly northwards shit corga is not going to be happy that you killed the gnome
[6150.20s -> 6161.13s]  wait I did does that still count that doesn't still count right I have I killed anybody no be
[6161.13s -> 6165.90s]  let's be honest I strangled a gnome I did I strangled the gnome with my bare hands and then
[6165.90s -> 6170.60s]  cut off his wimp height until he died but we rewound that have I killed anybody in this play
[6170.68s -> 6179.83s]  through here I killed the council guards fuck no but was that in defense no that was flanker

[6224.58s -> 6231.54s]  the order of the spell lines do you know it no no idea although I know my line came first
[6231.54s -> 6239.85s]  okay tell me about corga corga sees all and knows all suddenly the beggar grips your wrist
[6239.85s -> 6245.21s]  and squeezes what you risk your life if you talk to him remember please the left eye that's how
[6245.21s -> 6253.18s]  you start the left eye what happened to your eyes you take a moment to show some sympathy what
[6253.18s -> 6261.80s]  happened to your eyes a black eye curse and I know who cursed me it was sansis once he was a good
[6261.80s -> 6268.47s]  ruler fair and honest he ruled kare like a kind father looking after a cherished daughter nothing
[6268.47s -> 6274.20s]  was too much effort but he began to fear his other counselors he thought we were plotting against
[6274.20s -> 6283.80s]  him ready to overthrow him were you mulas was as soon as sansis gave mulas one of the spell lines
[6283.80s -> 6290.87s]  he wanted them all he wanted them for himself if he could hold the city to ransom mulas used to
[6290.87s -> 6302.90s]  be a blackmailer while I was loyal and sansis repaid me like this he was weeping you curse the
[6302.90s -> 6307.90s]  beggar for his useless half-help then you look to the track ahead and take your leave of him
[6307.90s -> 6319.42s]  your clues have been updated god damn it I just needed to have food where can I get food I need
[6319.42s -> 6325.37s]  to buy food where can I get food I need to rewind to get food corga's not gonna help me I kill
[6325.37s -> 6356.89s]  somebody in this rewind god damn it check the sewer check your notes on the spell order where is it
[6356.89s -> 6371.64s]  corgas grace wait I know it I know it I know it I know it I already know it corgas grace

[6391.72s -> 6414.17s]  like corgas grace and someone's pride shit who's pride who's pride the god of pride is who we need
[6414.17s -> 6426.81s]  to find out who the god of pride is shit oh no is it can we get it here corga no corga's not the
[6426.81s -> 6441.90s]  god of pride corgas the god of grace you need to get it from corga could I ask someone ask the
[6441.90s -> 6461.61s]  dead noble in the crypt uh let's try that let's try that over here right the fence is a slang
[6464.52s -> 6472.02s]  shit fuck doesn't know damn it we're so close I need literally one word to complete it I've
[6472.02s -> 6479.86s]  I've never completed this the path ends at a tall and ancient iron fence overgrown with weeds
[6479.86s -> 6485.37s]  through the dense leaves you can make out a wide area dotted with stones and small buildings and
[6485.37s -> 6493.46s]  straight somber trees it's an acropolis of mausoleums and tombs slang's the god of malice
[6493.46s -> 6506.87s]  maybe check the tombstones yeah that's right there are nobles buried here all right I'm
[6506.87s -> 6518.23s]  gonna uh let's cast spill wait I look at my health try the sewers what is big big is one
[6518.23s -> 6536.55s]  stamina is anything free zip it's not free what parts do you have I have everything besides the
[6536.55s -> 6550.28s]  name of the god of pride that's the only thing I don't know uh hopefully this doesn't kill me
[6550.28s -> 6558.07s]  I'm gonna climb it you test the ivy seems tightly wound about the railings wedging one toe between
[6558.07s -> 6563.19s]  the metal bars you grip the cords of the plant and haul your way up and the second foot is up
[6563.19s -> 6571.86s]  and you are climbing so you can feel the plant tearing under your hands keep on ow you keep
[6571.86s -> 6576.50s]  going hoping that if you move quickly you will clear the fence before the ivy comes away you
[6576.50s -> 6581.14s]  don't manage it near the very top you feel the sap leaking between your fingers as the cords of the
[6581.14s -> 6587.43s]  plant snap then you fall painfully back onto the rubble strewn ground however all is not lost where
[6587.43s -> 6592.76s]  the plant has torn away from the fence a foxhole has been revealed leading underneath the fence
[6592.76s -> 6596.84s]  something a rat perhaps scurries through the fence and back into the wasteland
[6596.84s -> 6605.45s]  all right we're going to the hole you kneel down and wriggle your way into the foxhole
[6605.45s -> 6609.69s]  it is so narrow that you have to keep your arms out in front of you and drag your pack along
[6609.69s -> 6614.73s]  behind but thankfully it is short coming up on the other side of the fence less than two strides
[6614.73s -> 6622.30s]  away you pull yourself up from a hole in the ground into the graveyard all right where's the
[6622.86s -> 6626.38s]  i need food i need to heal do i have do i have nothing
[6637.54s -> 6649.32s]  fuck try corga again last time they answered you still they just didn't bless you i remember him
[6649.32s -> 6655.70s]  standing up and saying um i'm going to destroy you how dare you take a life of somebody i'm going to
[6655.70s -> 6663.62s]  kill you how dare you okay you're once again standing in the city necropolis in the shadow
[6663.62s -> 6671.27s]  of the ewes and gravestones okay the sun is setting behind the wall look around the gravestones is
[6671.27s -> 6675.88s]  there anything we didn't get here you step nervously off the path and walk between the
[6675.88s -> 6681.40s]  nearest tombs somewhere ancient headstones tilt to the crazy angles others are fresh neatly carved
[6681.40s -> 6698.70s]  okay we were here we were here is anything here wait grave goods shit all right oldest grave
[6699.62s -> 6708.86s]  lorag all right no we lorag doesn't know we already talked to lorag don't argue with corga
[6708.86s -> 6723.61s]  look elsewhere we just need the god's name you were rude to him last time somebody said there
[6723.61s -> 6728.65s]  are two ways to get the final part of the spell line the second way is a bit eccentric
[6729.85s -> 6740.98s]  i love how you put that that's great it's a little eccentric go to corga you don't need
[6740.98s -> 6752.47s]  the corgas blessing all right we'll go to corga let's go to corga okay you return to the path

[6786.79s -> 6805.16s]  okay here we go up to corga you will not get the line from corga you need to go into the sewer

[6893.27s -> 6898.38s]  trees along a narrowing track until you reach a fork in the road to the left the track gets narrower
[6898.38s -> 6903.98s]  to the right a massive shadow looms yep okay so this we've been through here before we're gonna
[6903.98s -> 6911.56s]  make a move so wait wouldn't stepping in the circle in corgas thing is a teleport trap and
[6911.56s -> 6928.46s]  it puts me into the sewer doesn't it yep that's what we're doing uh okay let's make a move no no
[6928.46s -> 6941.80s]  no what okay look for an opening uh oh yeah we pay we pay the gargoyle right drop in a gold piece
[6941.80s -> 6949.74s]  and look into the eyes and we get health yep very good climb up uh we're gonna do cast spell
[6949.74s -> 6962.58s]  we're gonna probably gonna do big because or should we do float big works float works

[7002.20s -> 7011.06s]  of shit piece and then step right in the circle he's gonna be like oh why did i turn that on i
[7011.06s -> 7028.07s]  should have kept it off yeah we're gonna follow me i could learn another spell too right should i go
[7028.07s -> 7039.29s]  learn another spell that would work wouldn't it i get another chance to learn a second one yeah why
[7039.29s -> 7048.92s]  not let's do that before i um before i get out of here uh let's create a new spell for people that
[7048.92s -> 7053.48s]  didn't see yesterday's dream i'm sorry i'm kind of blowing through this but uh we did already do
[7053.48s -> 7058.68s]  all of this very slowly and very methodically so um if you haven't caught up yet i suggest you do
[7063.30s -> 7068.92s]  look to the stars you're a mage and not a mere sorcerer who knows what spell you could weave
[7068.92s -> 7081.24s]  at a spot like this it's the best place in the city let's try to make a new spell we did purr
[7081.24s -> 7094.92s]  last time which is summon a thousand cats tack is really good tar uh puke puke exists
[7096.44s -> 7101.48s]  luck i'm imagining luck is probably a good one too black is really good i think we can just
[7101.48s -> 7117.30s]  create whatever do tack tack what's litter luck lure tack is the best you should do tack please
[7117.30s -> 7126.41s]  tack all right let's do tack you fashion the stars into alignment and an enchantment is created
[7126.49s -> 7132.33s]  you feel a tingling sensation in your wrist and you look down to see flashing sparks in your palm
[7132.33s -> 7142.52s]  that flicker different colors for a moment gold then white then black um close my fist
[7146.78s -> 7151.90s]  you flex your fingers ready to grip the sparks which begin to flash faster and faster perhaps
[7151.90s -> 7158.78s]  the shade of the spark is important will you grab a certain color or trust to chance i don't know
[7159.78s -> 7185.11s]  gold just grab gold black is gold gonna give me money just grab gigachad um i need to pull
[7185.11s -> 7197.14s]  because i i genuinely don't know which one of these i'm gonna do uh one two or three i could
[7197.14s -> 7207.66s]  not make a decision if i wanted to yeah one is uh wait for the black spark two is wait for the
[7207.66s -> 7228.90s]  gold spark three is just grab whatever it looks like it's gonna be just grab so you want me just
[7229.06s -> 7240.26s]  to close my eyes and just gigachad who cares okay why would you guys do this right this is
[7240.26s -> 7250.18s]  not my decision so if i explode when i do this then it's not my fault all right just grab you
[7250.18s -> 7254.66s]  have no way of knowing the spell how the spell will last so you waste no time you close your
[7254.66s -> 7260.34s]  fist tight the sparks are hot in your palm but the pain fades quickly and when you reopen your fist
[7261.06s -> 7267.00s]  you found that you are now holding a wooden face mask of black wood the sparks in the spell
[7267.00s -> 7272.57s]  itself are gone you found one of the secret spells of the temple of corga the icy wind
[7272.57s -> 7289.00s]  chills you to the bone that is a new spell that i can do that's fear right where is it it's gack
[7289.00s -> 7300.81s]  isn't it fog mud niftel yak terrible fear within another's mind brave creatures will suffer a cold
[7300.81s -> 7314.98s]  sweat while cowardly ones will be reduced to powering jelly gack well i love y'all but i'm
[7314.98s -> 7326.22s]  so glad we have so many opportunities to use it go use it on the gnome all right it's time
[7327.75s -> 7335.96s]  then head back down and just go right in try to steal something what is tack though what does
[7335.96s -> 7353.19s]  that do is tack on there now uh no it's not because it's not known it's an unknown it's not my spell

[7370.41s -> 7377.82s]  this is the ziggurat of corga the gracious go inside oh shit i forgot about the snake
[7377.82s -> 7408.95s]  i forgot about the snake no you dick oh my god rewind i forgot about the snake get out of here
[7408.95s -> 7419.00s]  minus four minus four minus four full blast again kill him kill him kill him we cheat
[7419.00s -> 7433.29s]  we cheat we cheat we cheat all right corga you're a little bit of a dick there's corga
[7433.29s -> 7440.39s]  uh up there steal something yeah fuck this place the temple is cluttered with so many valuable
[7440.39s -> 7445.93s]  artifacts it is hard to decide where to begin there are sculptures plates candlesticks and
[7445.93s -> 7452.12s]  shields of solid gold a table covered with a silk cloth holds a crystal decanter and four
[7452.12s -> 7458.33s]  golden goblets in another corner a fountain showers with an endless stream of diamonds and jewels
[7458.33s -> 7464.12s]  take a handful of fucking jewels you go over to the fountain gazing in wonderment at the
[7464.12s -> 7469.46s]  sparkling splendor that issues from its spout you could simply put your pack underneath the stream
[7469.46s -> 7474.66s]  open and make enough money to hire an army to take with you to mampang you take a fistful of
[7474.66s -> 7479.46s]  the jewels but then you freeze the humming sound in the temple has become louder and you have a
[7479.46s -> 7486.55s]  strong sense that something is watching you turn around and look you turn your gaze up and see
[7486.55s -> 7492.25s]  nothing but wait a moment weren't there four stone demons up in the rafters above the altar before
[7492.25s -> 7498.47s]  the gargoyles are flapping in the air above you they are still stone but now their jaws are working
[7498.47s -> 7504.25s]  and their teeth snap in the air in front of their faces you begin to ready a spell but the creatures
[7504.25s -> 7510.10s]  know a sorcerer when they see one in moments one has dived for your right arm and with a single
[7510.10s -> 7517.34s]  bite severs it clean away what you look down in horror you will not be able to cast any more
[7517.34s -> 7522.95s]  spells now or wield your sword well the gargoyles hover back a little perhaps hoping that the
[7522.95s -> 7538.09s]  punishment has been suitably severe i can never cast the spell ever again that sucks um we we
[7538.09s -> 7546.47s]  ain't living with that i know i'm just i'm a cheating andy so bad right now whatever whatever
[7546.47s -> 7559.94s]  whatever i don't care i don't care whatever it's fine what else can i do here should i just zap
[7559.94s -> 7578.86s]  the statue should i just cast lightning and put it directly into corgis head it's three stamina
[7578.86s -> 7607.98s]  though that's bad do hot and just burn this place down um doesn't matter i mean i i'm trying to get
[7607.98s -> 7617.85s]  to the sewer because the sewer is where we can apparently figure out this last word maybe all
[7617.85s -> 7626.90s]  right i'm just walking across let's go nonsense and superstition you stride across the carpet
[7626.90s -> 7631.48s]  towards the idol but along the way something happens although you cannot be sure of what
[7631.48s -> 7638.26s]  one moment you are in the temple of corga and the next you are in the sewer this is where we want
[7638.26s -> 7652.46s]  to be let's find this goddamn line you've landed in a disgusting pile of unbelievable filth slime
[7652.54s -> 7658.78s]  excrement sludge dung and dregs all the way up to your neck you are evidently in the sewers of
[7658.78s -> 7668.49s]  kare wait you wait a moment as a nearby chute ejects a torrent of filth and pig swill then
[7668.49s -> 7674.36s]  you get yourself to your feet and wipe off the sludge as best you can oh we just got elden ringed
[7674.36s -> 7688.23s]  by the way where am i you stand in a cavernous sewer tunnel filled knee deep with slow flowing
[7688.23s -> 7695.66s]  stench filled water it is pitch black you could be standing on a mountaintop or inside of a coffin
[7695.66s -> 7704.70s]  except that is for a single speck of light somewhere in the far distance you wait and
[7704.70s -> 7711.32s]  within a few moments the tunnel is filled with goblins there are not one or two but a whole army
[7711.32s -> 7718.31s]  led by a tall stocky elder goblin enchanting a weird guttural song they pause a short distance
[7718.31s -> 7725.75s]  away from you and the leader steps forward you should not be here this is the domain of the mad
[7726.23s -> 7756.22s]  king end of us fuck you gack or god damn it i could be the new god uh hot that's too much stamina
[7756.22s -> 7764.60s]  though i need to i need to do the things that are not stamina gack would work pop would work
[7764.60s -> 7773.42s]  i don't have any pebbles though uh god would work but that's stamina i think gack is good
[7773.42s -> 7784.70s]  let's try it it doesn't cost any stamina gack you cast the spell whipping out the black face mask
[7784.70s -> 7791.50s]  the goblins shake and quiver with fear you are clearly a powerful being we will not trouble you
[7791.50s -> 7798.18s]  and with that he waves his army on they march off into the tunnel jeer at them you call and
[7798.18s -> 7805.08s]  jeer at the goblins as they pass but they are well trained even the grunts at the back ignore you
[7805.08s -> 7812.84s]  at the rear are two goblin generals how many more soldiers does the mad king want thousands
[7813.80s -> 7821.42s]  they don't get what he gets that he will the two walk on still talking in muttering voices like
[7821.42s -> 7831.78s]  this one didn't see that there were no quotes the goblins are tramping away up the sewer all right
[7831.78s -> 7841.51s]  head the other way follow the goblins i mean what does this go this goes down here potentially up
[7842.07s -> 7849.14s]  this goes up and potentially over here i'm going to follow them with the face mask on and just be
[7849.14s -> 7853.90s]  like
[7866.33s -> 7870.79s]  jim carrey from yeah i'm gonna be running around that's exactly what i was thinking of
[7870.79s -> 7876.07s]  do you know what i was holy shit that person you that i didn't even say it but that was exactly
[7876.07s -> 7881.96s]  what was in my mind jim carrey from the mask when he's in the office and he's holding it up to his
[7882.04s -> 7884.66s]  face and it doesn't work and he's just going like
[7887.62s -> 7891.30s]  he's making all these noises and jumping around that is what i was just doing as well that was
[7891.30s -> 7896.58s]  in my head i just didn't say it i didn't know how many people were going to understand that
[7900.65s -> 7914.98s]  that was the sweetest chef hey is the mask in the library of congress is it because it better be
[7914.98s -> 7921.90s]  that's like has to be right can somebody look that up is is jim carries the mask in the library of
[7921.90s -> 7934.65s]  congress if why no not the mask itself like the movie prop i'm talking about the the movie
[7938.63s -> 7949.46s]  like people in congress like want to go look at it yeah if this one movie somebody said it if
[7949.46s -> 7953.78s]  there's somebody said they shot it into space if there's one movie they should shoot into space
[7953.78s -> 7964.12s]  it's the mask just confuse the fuck out of all the aliens there's only jim carries the mask and
[7965.16s -> 7973.34s]  and a wheel we're like a car tire like what the hell is going on with what what is this
[7973.34s -> 7982.94s]  just that would be crazy right what the fuck even is this thing a car tire with the hubcap on
[7982.94s -> 7989.29s]  that's all of our inventions oh we found this strange thing siya look what we found we pulled
[7989.29s -> 7996.82s]  it into the beam it's a wheel that's what they put in their uh the thing in their time capsule
[7996.82s -> 8003.59s]  a fucking wheel at the jim carrey movie well we aren't going there they would never no we
[8003.59s -> 8009.72s]  would never get invaded we would never be invaded why would you invade this place why would you ever
[8009.72s -> 8016.44s]  care no no no we can just skip that planet they just they sent out a wheel and a jim carrey movie
[8016.44s -> 8022.66s]  we don't have to worry about that place don't shoot any interesting technology there right it's
[8022.66s -> 8030.28s]  like oh man we should share our technology are you kidding me don't send an iphone up there
[8030.28s -> 8046.76s]  send a burnt torch and a wheel they're going to skip our planet that's isolationist would you
[8046.76s -> 8050.84s]  want the aliens to know the technology that we have i don't want oh yeah let's make sure the
[8050.84s -> 8065.96s]  satellite communicates no all right anyways where were we um it's not did uh jim carrey the mask is
[8065.96s -> 8080.20s]  not in the library of congress but shrek is yeah i don't put i send up like a stick with a like a
[8080.20s -> 8088.87s]  cloth wrapping around it and like a shark tooth on it look yes tools we have tool we tool oh poor
[8088.87s -> 8106.71s]  earth no no no no no no we just leave them okay here we go send up a stick yeah the fact
[8106.71s -> 8112.55s]  the fact that it would be in a rocket ship means we have the technology to have a rocket ship
[8112.55s -> 8120.07s]  communicate in the first place that would be even more bizarre right why we're not fooling anybody
[8120.07s -> 8125.53s]  why would they put this in the we have rocket fuel but they're showing us that they have primitive
[8125.53s -> 8139.51s]  tools that's stupid uh yeah never mind what i said was dumb we have the technology to throw
[8139.51s -> 8149.91s]  that shit on whatever all right let's move on i fucked up i fucked up you trail along behind
[8149.91s -> 8169.19s]  the goblins like a shadow can't move on yet that was really dumb i don't know for some reason i
[8169.19s -> 8175.29s]  was thinking about in my mind i'm thinking about a tool with like earth carved in it somehow being
[8175.29s -> 8180.74s]  shot out of a cannon into space like it's not a rocket we just have a bag floating around in space
[8180.74s -> 8186.94s]  it's not on a rocket ship there's a bag in space that they come across and it's shitty tools and
[8186.94s -> 8196.71s]  a wheel right that's what i was thinking of like we don't leave a rocket ship it's just a bag
[8203.82s -> 8208.06s]  these like primitive cavemen are just taking their tools and throwing them as hard as they can into
[8208.06s -> 8224.12s]  the air it'll get we'll get soon strong reach space imagine if we did kind of what ellon mustered
[8224.12s -> 8244.01s]  with the car but instead slingshot on a metal box with sticks and shiny rocks yeah who cares
[8244.01s -> 8250.74s]  all right all right i'm done with i'm done we're gonna move on it's just too stupid to not at least
[8250.74s -> 8261.46s]  spend five minutes on it what if wood was rare to them that's true too like shit we gotta be careful
[8261.46s -> 8269.38s]  what if trees what if wood was an unbelievable resource and the aliens are like wait a minute
[8269.38s -> 8279.56s]  they have wood on this planet liquefy it and take all the trees don't send anything to space
[8279.56s -> 8286.23s]  they can come find us okay we don't send anything to space some people might see it as a threat
[8286.23s -> 8292.95s]  uh boss there's a metal box here that has earth carved on it and there's an ax in here shoot the
[8292.95s -> 8304.98s]  fucking beam at it that's an act of violence that's a threat please move on i have an essay do
[8304.98s -> 8318.49s]  well go do your essay you're assuming that aliens are as stupid as we are this is a declaration of
[8318.49s -> 8331.75s]  war the aliens finally show up one day the president goes on camera uh ladies and gentlemen it's the
[8331.75s -> 8336.73s]  president i just need to make sure everyone understands that the aliens are arriving on
[8336.73s -> 8344.30s]  tuesday and they think we're all primitive cave men and cave women so for one day only at least
[8344.30s -> 8351.48s]  everybody don't speak in any languages everyone crawl around and save noises and grow your beards
[8351.48s -> 8357.22s]  out as long as you can we keep up we gotta keep up like the the actual thing here we could keep the
[8357.22s -> 8372.49s]  personas up the aliens land everyone just kind of like throwing rocks making sounds grow a beard by
[8372.49s -> 8391.46s]  tuesday yeah some people can do that not me you do it in the bernie voice all right let's go
[8391.46s -> 8398.49s]  destroy all the cars yeah unfortunately ladies and gentlemen my fellow americans
[8399.37s -> 8405.91s]  all cars need to be destroyed or not destroyed but hidden there'll be government issued tarps
[8405.91s -> 8411.83s]  to put over all your vehicles and all your houses uh everyone is to dig a hole five feet deep in
[8411.83s -> 8418.36s]  their backyard and hang out in there for just six hours while the aliens walk around and uh survey
[8418.36s -> 8428.82s]  the planet how long would you have to keep that up what if they wanted to hang out oh this is
[8428.82s -> 8433.30s]  beautiful what a wonderful planet and they're so primitive i think we'll stay here for uh two or
[8433.30s -> 8440.06s]  three uh parsecuens oh two or three parsecuens was that a week oh on your planet that's three
[8440.06s -> 8457.70s]  thousand years oh well well let's do it for a little bit longer and they know right these
[8457.70s -> 8463.18s]  motherfuckers know ah yeah i wonder how long they're going to keep this up they know they want to see
[8463.18s -> 8482.15s]  like just how long we'll do this for i feel like you came from an alternate reality i'm from this
[8482.15s -> 8487.27s]  reality there what do you mean look just because the marvel movies came out and we're like look
[8487.27s -> 8492.71s]  there's this spider-man and there's another spider-man we don't know shit guys it's just
[8492.71s -> 8504.18s]  us and the cockroaches okay i'm sorry it's just us the cockroaches and like the the bunny rabbits
[8504.18s -> 8512.62s]  there's nothing else it doesn't matter that's a big spoiler a spoiler for what i don't know
[8512.62s -> 8516.94s]  look i okay i get the theory but the fact that okay so this what there's like an infinite amount
[8516.94s -> 8524.26s]  of me sitting in this chair having an infinite amount of rants about the alien joke no it's just
[8524.26s -> 8543.27s]  us and the bugs there's nothing else it's just us and the fucking earwigs who is he talking to
[8543.27s -> 8546.63s]  i know i'm stalling all right all right i'm not stalling though this is just an interesting
[8546.63s -> 8558.70s]  conversation what if they came down and they were large sentient earwigs i get to stick around
[8558.70s -> 8564.06s]  because i they will look at all my history here and they'll be like this guy was talking about
[8564.06s -> 8569.72s]  earwigs and he talked about how they were cool and they were an awesome group of uh beings and
[8569.72s -> 8578.89s]  i they would i would become an ambassador to earth sorry guys would you ever eat earwig meat
[8578.89s -> 8583.53s]  no all right you trail along behind the goblins like a shadow god we've been sitting for like
[8583.53s -> 8590.57s]  10 minutes the vaclands tribes are ready the first goblin general hisses second goblin makes a
[8590.57s -> 8596.17s]  chittering noise something close to a laugh ready to run through the city like a river of molten
[8596.17s -> 8602.18s]  steel that her word from the king a few words but i have learned a few of myself
[8603.69s -> 8630.15s]  hey what was that freeze or keep up i probably get high right right over here freeze you freeze
[8630.15s -> 8635.13s]  the goblins keep walking away out of earshot not stopping they do not look around but continue
[8635.13s -> 8649.75s]  talking in low voices catch up you hurry up and catch up with the goblins i thought i said a corpse
[8649.75s -> 8662.57s]  the tunnel turns a corner something glints from the side of the sewer i gotta keep up i have to
[8663.21s -> 8689.48s]  keep up i missed it you missed the spell line what i missed the spell line no i didn't keep up
[8689.48s -> 8696.57s]  i'm gonna run right into them keep up i heard nothing the other replies you heard a key pace
[8696.57s -> 8708.28s]  just behind them in the dark further on you know one of the lines one goblin is quizzing the other
[8708.28s -> 8717.85s]  the goblin spits an agreement i ever had the mad king whispered to himself in forger's pride
[8717.85s -> 8723.96s]  you can't believe your luck it's the second half of theta's spell line i got them all now
[8723.96s -> 8735.22s]  i win got it we've got all the lines we just don't know the order but it's okay this is the
[8735.22s -> 8741.06s]  first time i'm ever going to complete part two truly actually getting the good end and not the
[8741.06s -> 8749.98s]  bad end every single time okay something let's look at it you stop to look at it losing the
[8749.98s -> 8755.42s]  sight of the goblins it's a vial of it's a vial of potion sniff it you uncork it and sniff it it's
[8755.42s -> 8766.74s]  blimbleberry quaff it i should probably quaff it yeah i quaff it you unstoppable the blimberry
[8766.74s -> 8772.34s]  potion and knock it back quickly you feel a little better and all traces of hunger are gone also
[8772.34s -> 8781.85s]  the goblins disappear so does that actually mean that i know everything do i know the whole thing
[8781.85s -> 8796.52s]  i got the whole thing by corgas grace and forga's pride one lock made of golems hide tumblers to
[8796.52s -> 8808.26s]  seal deep inside i bid you portals open wide got it that's definitely the order that's the rhyme
[8809.94s -> 8822.46s]  okay i can turn back or we can keep going as we'll just keep going if the king knew you even knew
[8822.46s -> 8832.14s]  that much tell him and i cut your throat ah stay quiet and maybe we'll get out of this oh wait stay
[8832.14s -> 8837.75s]  quiet maybe we'll cut his throat just then you see more lights up ahead it seems the sewer is opening
[8837.75s -> 8856.28s]  out into a wider space the opening all the lines rhyme do they one lock made of golems hide
[8857.54s -> 8867.35s]  tumblers to seal deep inside like corga oh they all rhyme they all whatever
[8875.64s -> 8880.54s]  you slip into the hall it is warm with the fetid breath of a thousand creatures
[8880.54s -> 8887.24s]  who drink and laugh and clash swords down in the muck on his throne their king seems to be sleeping
[8887.24s -> 8896.04s]  or else they have killed him by accident he's a man not a goblin how does he control this rabble
[8896.04s -> 8903.48s]  you wait transfixed by the strange scene the king coughs suddenly the effect is bizarre at the noise
[8903.48s -> 8915.02s]  every goblin in the great chamber freezes and looks up interesting the man is thin as if he
[8915.02s -> 8922.36s]  has not eaten in months and pale as if he has been in the dark just as long his hair is long and gray
[8922.36s -> 8928.38s]  and he slumps over the side of his throne as though desperately ill his clothes are long soiled robes
[8928.38s -> 8937.80s]  that perhaps were once quite fine on his hand is a ring a diamond ring which he gazes at periodically
[8937.80s -> 8945.11s]  and on his head he wears a gray circlet of a dull silver metal you cannot quite place the king pushes
[8945.11s -> 8953.56s]  on the arm of his chair attempting to stand then shivers and falls down silence the chamber is
[8953.56s -> 8965.53s]  suddenly quiet look at his face you peer through the gloom through the grime and dirt and the
[8965.53s -> 8971.53s]  thickness of his beard trying to see his face there's something familiar about it you've seen
[8971.53s -> 8981.45s]  it somewhere before the king fingers the circlet on his head as if scared it will slip my creatures
[8981.45s -> 8991.26s]  the time is almost on us as the night draws in we will rise up and open the gates we will rub this
[8991.26s -> 9003.66s]  filthy city clean he's broken off into a fit of coughing you keep waiting wanting to see what
[9003.66s -> 9012.10s]  comes next the long journey is nearly over the process i began when i blinded lord theta
[9012.10s -> 9018.70s]  and left him a beggar finally the council will be destroyed and the city will be
[9018.70s -> 9036.63s]  cleansed it's not dumbledore so this is this is sansa's yeah this is the first noble uh i'm
[9036.63s -> 9044.46s]  afraid if i keep listening you stay hidden a goblin close by by your elbow murmurs how much
[9044.46s -> 9051.70s]  longer do we have to listen to this his companion silences him with a talon to the arm shut up wait
[9051.70s -> 9057.18s]  and listen you stay hidden and wait the king finally gets to his feet and raised into wise an arm
[9057.18s -> 9067.58s]  into the air i will open the gates for you tonight and we will make this city pure the king raises a
[9067.58s -> 9075.45s]  cheer and the goblins as one cheer back throwing their swords up in the air a thousand blades flash
[9075.45s -> 9081.38s]  and the confusion when they landed extreme every goblin cowering for cover and then squabbling to
[9081.38s -> 9093.62s]  retrieve their blade all right let's go move now it's time to get the hell out of here creep to a
[9093.62s -> 9105.14s]  ladder or return to the sewer well i think we can get out this way sticking to the shadows you begin
[9105.14s -> 9108.98s]  to creep around the perimeter of the hall aiming for one of those long ladders that disappear up
[9108.98s -> 9114.89s]  into the darkness you get about halfway before the goblins nearby turn pushing at each other
[9114.89s -> 9119.98s]  and you are forced to freeze the king calls for silence but the goblins do not hear him they are
[9119.98s -> 9126.12s]  still in a mess with their swords go go go get out go just leave just run run run run run run
[9126.12s -> 9139.14s]  keep going keep going no no you creep further around the edge of the hall the king calls a
[9139.14s -> 9145.30s]  again for silence clutching his circlet with one hand this time the goblins fall silent you realize
[9145.30s -> 9148.98s]  with a heavy heart that you've missed the best opportunity you will get to escape the chamber by
[9148.98s -> 9190.36s]  the ladder what look at his face all right i'm okay you know who it is familiar all right go
[9190.36s -> 9206.63s]  andy rewind that's fine uh yep keep going make a move we get out the long journey is nearly over
[9206.63s -> 9218.36s]  the process i began when i blinded lord theta left him a beggar let's go and we're out how much
[9218.36s -> 9228.18s]  longer do we have to listen to this make a move they raise a cheer hooray make a move we're out
[9228.18s -> 9234.74s]  get out leave quick taking advantage of the confusion you scurry quickly up the ladder
[9234.74s -> 9239.86s]  for a few rungs you are in the open it must look like a strange oversized rat climbing the rigging
[9239.86s -> 9244.95s]  in this underground cell but you climb fast and quietly and are quickly lost into the shadows
[9244.95s -> 9254.79s]  overhead once more you climb the ladder into a narrow stone chimney which climbs at an angle
[9254.79s -> 9259.11s]  after a while the ladder gives out and there is nothing but stone above you in the distance
[9259.11s -> 9277.34s]  a circle of light god i'm gonna fall right back down on my back gum raz sharpen blade
[9277.90s -> 9293.35s]  with oh i can probably stick it in the side force field float in the air float would work
[9293.35s -> 9307.66s]  yeah let's float float in the air you cast the spell making your body featherweight
[9307.66s -> 9311.74s]  you then paw your way up the stone chimney pushing off the walls with your hands and feet
[9311.74s -> 9316.82s]  as if you were dancing up towards the light you emerge in a grateful heap to the fresh air of the
[9316.82s -> 9329.27s]  outside world it's oh it's right here we're i got the let's go let's go go go go go you've emerged
[9329.27s -> 9333.67s]  from a well house in a clearing in the shadow of the city wall looking around you realize how far
[9333.67s -> 9338.47s]  you've come on the other side of this clearing is the north gate itself wasting no time you stride
[9338.47s -> 9345.24s]  over to the gate we gotta go now you reach the other side of the clearing unscathed and stand
[9345.24s -> 9361.86s]  below the enormous doors okay what's the the north gate spell i know what the first line is
[9361.86s -> 9374.62s]  here it is something that the corgas grace one lock deep inside i bid you corgo lock deep bid
[9377.54s -> 9386.36s]  let's go recite the spell you knock firmly on the door until you wake with the voice
[9387.48s -> 9396.15s]  you knock firmly on the door until you wake the voice within do you know the spell to open this
[9396.15s -> 9404.15s]  gate you close your eyes and try to recall the scratched poem in the sewer chamber of by corgas
[9404.15s -> 9415.16s]  grace and forgus pride one lock made of golems hide tumblers too sealed deep inside i bid you
[9415.16s -> 9425.51s]  portals open wide you stand back to see what effect your lines have had the voice has gone silent
[9425.51s -> 9433.00s]  you wait impatiently to see what will happen then the gate creaks the tumblers drop and the
[9433.08s -> 9441.10s]  wooden panels begin to move the door is opening booming out the voice declares the gate is under
[9441.10s -> 9453.16s]  your control but it is moving slowly looking over your shoulder you see an army of goblins
[9453.16s -> 9461.78s]  emerging from a well shaft and they are racing towards you oh do i just run i've i don't think
[9461.78s -> 9469.46s]  we've ever done this do i just run through go go go go go you rush through the gate into the back
[9469.46s -> 9480.84s]  lens okay just go go go go this i'm not waiting beyond the north gate in the darkness around you

[9488.84s -> 9498.30s]  close it on him gate close the gate obeys immediately swinging shut like a trap
[9499.19s -> 9504.23s]  from the low hills around red-faced marsh goblins are springing up and pouring towards the sealed
[9504.23s -> 9509.35s]  gate like flies into a fallen ox they begin to scramble on top of one another trying to
[9509.43s -> 9516.71s]  bridge the wall with their own bodies destroy the goblins the goblins must be destroyed
[9517.27s -> 9526.46s]  as though on command a ghostly figure forms in the air before you it is lorag you control the gate
[9527.26s -> 9539.35s]  use it uh you do it uh i don't know how try it is hopeless how can you use a magic you do not know
[9540.15s -> 9545.35s]  you close your eyes feeling your anger and frustration rising the hated goblins this
[9545.35s -> 9549.99s]  meddling specter the long and difficult road behind and the ones still to come all seem to
[9549.99s -> 9557.69s]  bite into your very soul like wolf teeth there is suddenly a terrible sound and a smell of burning
[9561.64s -> 9569.37s]  open my eyes you open your eyes there's not a goblin in sight just blackened grass around the
[9569.37s -> 9577.50s]  gate and black soot and piles on top of the wall the ghost nods slowly to you
[9584.50s -> 9590.18s]  i'll keep it on fuck it all the hatred of the whole city of thieves and liars and murderers
[9590.18s -> 9596.50s]  stored for centuries a little leak towered into the red eyes the rest was waiting for this for one
[9596.50s -> 9606.34s]  strong of hard enough to use it go be safe the long road is long huh he gestures to the path ahead
[9606.34s -> 9626.76s]  be safe you're not in turn to go so what so i burn the city so that's my i did it no just the
[9626.76s -> 9634.68s]  goblins though this is getting intense all right here we go outside kare into the back lands
[9635.32s -> 9643.11s]  from a short distance away you look back to see the plane outside the gate is quite empty
[9643.83s -> 9650.22s]  not a single marsh goblin remains but a single short sword or hooked pick it is like they have
[9650.22s -> 9656.06s]  been wiped from the surface of the earth and inside kare something similar must have occurred
[9656.06s -> 9659.18s]  as where there was the sound of flashing swords there is now only silence
[9660.22s -> 9667.27s]  you have saved kare a foul city perhaps but not one whose citizens deserve to die by a goblin
[9667.27s -> 9674.73s]  sword but it has been at a cost to your strength you turn your back your own road lies ahead
[9675.37s -> 9682.94s]  through the plains of badubak and on towards mampang the back lands await you remember the
[9682.94s -> 9688.26s]  words of the site master sergeant as you left the outpost settlement once you have crossed the city
[9688.26s -> 9693.93s]  port of traps you will enter the backlands they say that day and night are controlled by forces
[9693.93s -> 9711.38s]  other than the sun and from kare too your progress will be watched to badubak your journey across

[9730.28s -> 9735.80s]  and that silver weapons harm the undead you collected a fantastic number of magical artifacts

[9747.40s -> 9753.45s]  poison a bottle of bark essence a bottle of snake bite antidote and a tinderbox you're very happy
[9753.45s -> 9759.58s]  considering this was your grocery list and it is now complete you're still armed only with your

[10533.88s -> 10541.61s]  designed to trap the unwary and you faced an army of enchanted werewolves as they sought to
[10541.61s -> 10549.53s]  overthrow the first noble i fought one werewolf but you know i could say an army i fought one
[10549.53s -> 10558.23s]  werewolf that's fine one werewolf attacked me on the road and uh i killed it but the backlands
[10558.23s -> 10569.40s]  are different but the plains of badu bak will be different once long ago this land thrived
[10569.40s -> 10575.61s]  prospering in the warm shadow of the fortress of sorcerers high in the zanzunu peaks then
[10575.61s -> 10582.25s]  something changed they say the last refugee to reach kare declared only they are all gone
[10582.25s -> 10593.48s]  the north gate was sealed and the backlands left to die now the gates stand open they say the land
[10593.48s -> 10599.69s]  beyond the gates is cursed no one from the young country of aniland has ever crossed this wilderness
[10599.69s -> 10606.71s]  before you will be the first the old world is counting on you but already you have no food
[10606.71s -> 10614.34s]  this stage of your journey will be punishing but you cannot turn back ladies and gentlemen
[10614.34s -> 10638.74s]  inkle presents a story by steve jackson steve jackson's story part three the seven servants
[10638.74s -> 10651.13s]  is the gate of kare again let's take a look at this here you go it's very large it's like five
[10651.13s -> 10664.17s]  different world of warcraft zones and something else happens here too that's even more ridiculous
[10664.17s -> 10673.08s]  and you'll find out if you don't know and if you do know don't tell anybody because it's cool it's
[10673.08s -> 10687.48s]  cool and we're gonna let everybody figure that out no spoilers here we go the stones of the old road
[10687.48s -> 10693.43s]  disappear under a layer of dust and sand at your back looms the great wall the city port of kare
[10693.51s -> 10703.21s]  ahead there is nothing but an empty waste and the night you cast a glance at the city port even now
[10703.21s -> 10709.83s]  vic is taking control the baying of his wolves echoes across the plains that's a storyline
[10709.83s -> 10719.38s]  we did not do but um the city's there and vic apparently has taken it look up at the stars
[10719.38s -> 10725.40s]  you turn your gaze from kare to the stars wondering what fresh secrets they may hold
[10725.40s -> 10736.84s]  this far from the walls of aniland into the plains every step along the broken road takes you further
[10736.84s -> 10743.82s]  from safety and into the unknown something the ape perhaps sets your senses tingling you're not
[10743.82s -> 10763.03s]  alone out here is that the screech of a bird you hear or a distant scream we could talk to animals
[10764.90s -> 10780.84s]  we could uh just throw a fireball into the air we could sense danger let's talk to animals all
[10780.84s -> 10792.84s]  right let's try it it doesn't cost anything you cast the spell and pull on the wig in the distance
[10792.84s -> 10797.32s]  you hear the screeching of birds but as the spell takes hold the sound resolves into words
[10799.08s -> 10807.56s]  there's one he looks like a tasty morsel i claim first strike a moment later a ferocious
[10807.56s -> 10816.70s]  nighthawk has plunged from the sky talon's outstretched for your neck worse voice shut up
[10818.02s -> 10838.82s]  shut up that's how you do a bird that's a bird voice what do you want me to do all right i'm
[10838.82s -> 10846.17s]  gonna uh i'm gonna roll you hurl yourself to one side just in time and the sharp claws sweep
[10846.17s -> 10855.42s]  past your neck to rake the dirt i will shred you to your gizzards tasty one the bird wheels up
[10855.42s -> 10860.46s]  into the sky to rejoin its group take his eyes take his eyes you count four birds circling ready
[10860.46s -> 10871.96s]  to attack shout in defiance try to take me i have killed a manticore we will take your blood all
[10871.96s -> 10892.20s]  right bad enough are they stupid i think they're intelligent aren't they oh that would be all right
[10900.57s -> 10905.98s]  i don't think they're magical well they don't talk i can i can understand them because i have
[10905.98s -> 10913.96s]  the wig on i could put up a wall i can't do anything expensive because i only have what seven
[10914.52s -> 10937.85s]  stamina um i'm gonna say wait a minute i could i float up to them i'm floating up to them and
[10937.85s -> 10945.61s]  i'm gonna okay let's float you cast the spell and feel yourself lifting gently off the ground
[10945.61s -> 10951.00s]  as your weight is reduced to that of a feather the nighthawks do not pause one swoops talon
[10951.00s -> 10960.89s]  spiking your shoulder knocking you sprawling to the ground i prick you i'm dead you stay down
[10960.89s -> 10966.22s]  hoping the bird will leave you for dead but nighthawks do not attack for pleasure but for
[10966.22s -> 10974.01s]  food lying still makes them bold and soon all three are diving for you then quite suddenly
[10974.01s -> 10979.90s]  the nighthawks break formation something else is shimmering into visibility in their very midst
[10979.90s -> 10990.07s]  you settle back to the ground as your spell wears off wait what so wait they hit me in the
[10990.07s -> 10994.55s]  in the air midair and i'm lying down but pretending to be lagged out of the server
[10995.11s -> 11005.86s]  i'm just floating there falling slowly on my side all right i'm running crawl you belly crawl
[11006.50s -> 11012.65s]  up to higher ground while behind you the strangest of battles ensues the wing of one nighthawk snaps
[11012.65s -> 11019.27s]  upwards like a broken branch a second is ripped into feathers by invisible claws the remaining
[11019.27s -> 11034.71s]  birds scatter there's nothing left but your mysterious savior uh i'm gonna stay hidden you
[11034.71s -> 11040.34s]  stay low hoping the creature will not see you but there is a rush of air just in front of you
[11040.34s -> 11046.73s]  whatever it is has landed you hear the movement of unseen feathered wings and then at last you
[11046.73s -> 11059.96s]  understand this creature is a gold crest eagle from the king's own eerie in aniland the eerie
[11059.96s -> 11067.24s]  is deep behind the shumantanti wall it must have flown for three days to reach you but why the
[11067.24s -> 11076.36s]  creature slowly becoming visible sees you have recognized it it tilts its beak bow you bow your
[11076.36s -> 11082.76s]  head to the eagle it opens its beak in reply and something falls to the ground it is a message
[11082.76s -> 11087.75s]  cylinder whatever it contains must be of vital importance or the king would not have risked
[11087.75s -> 11099.13s]  revealing your location like this to deliver it to you take the tube you reach down and pick up
[11099.13s -> 11103.69s]  the tube inside is a rolled parchment sealed with the royal seal of the king of aniland
[11103.69s -> 11115.37s]  but you pause for a moment and sigh the king has accidentally sent you his letter to santa claus
[11115.37s -> 11127.83s]  it must have been some kind of mix-up okay let me read this we trust these tidings reach you in
[11127.83s -> 11135.70s]  fair health but must warn you of impending peril your mission is discovered the man pangs eyes have
[11135.70s -> 11143.21s]  spied our plan and word is on its way to the dark fortress too late we discovered our unwelcome
[11143.21s -> 11149.53s]  eavesdroppers and news of your quest is being carried towards high xamen by the seven serpents
[11149.61s -> 11155.18s]  the archmage's most trusted servants by now they will have reached the backlands
[11155.18s -> 11161.94s]  and here they will divide to complete their journey separately if you are still able seek
[11161.94s -> 11169.05s]  them out for they must stop to rest and eat destroy the creatures before they reach their goal
[11169.05s -> 11177.30s]  else the archmage will prepare a deadly welcome for you find shadrach the hermit for advice
[11177.30s -> 11186.42s]  for not moves through the backlands without his knowledge our hearts are with you the seal
[11186.42s -> 11196.66s]  fucking george washington thank the eagle you look up but the goldcrest eagle has already
[11196.66s -> 11201.37s]  rendered itself invisible once more you feel the rush of air as its great wings lift it from the
[11201.37s -> 11212.31s]  ground and you are alone destroy it or keep it i feel like maybe keep it because this might be
[11212.31s -> 11220.73s]  proof like hey i've got the king of aniland has the seal here maybe it's i could use it for help
[11220.73s -> 11233.00s]  that's possible right or destroy it because if somebody finds it on me then they know what i'm
[11233.00s -> 11251.45s]  doing here keep it to show the hermit yeah i'm not sure either way how this would work um yeah
[11251.45s -> 11257.83s]  we'll do a poll should i destroy the message or hold on to it in case i need to use it it's pretty
[11257.83s -> 11279.85s]  50 50 on what would happen i need food and i need to sleep this is bad one or two what are we

[11334.41s -> 11338.97s]  message up and slip it into your pack it would seem the backlands are not as deserted as you
[11338.97s -> 11344.73s]  had supposed you must find these seven serpents and destroy them or your journey will be for
[11344.73s -> 11354.94s]  nothing two new clues what are the clues seven serpents seven serpents threaten your journey
[11354.94s -> 11362.14s]  for they carry a message that will warn the archmage of your coming uh shadrack the hermit
[11362.14s -> 11370.71s]  can help you only silver weapons can harm the undead you are given a clue about the backlands
[11371.35s -> 11382.17s]  for sleeping of the sleepless ram seek the one they call the sham okay still have all my shit
[11382.17s -> 11395.03s]  right yeah all right back to the road the stars turned in the sky overhead taking the pole as
[11395.03s -> 11401.27s]  your guide you rejoin the old road and make your way north before you the backlands stretch away
[11401.27s -> 11408.68s]  to a dim horizon how can you hope to locate seven serpents in such a wilderness my spirit will guide
[11408.68s -> 11418.76s]  me the ape my spirit will guide me you will no doubt require the ape even more than ever before
[11419.32s -> 11429.03s]  out here where nothing else can be trusted and the ape has told you to walk off of a cliff so you do
[11429.03s -> 11438.76s]  it no decision is permanent rewind at any time that it was that was that wrong after about half
[11438.76s -> 11444.20s]  an hour you see a deep black line across the earth up ahead and catch your step just in time
[11444.20s -> 11450.28s]  you are one pace away from the edge of a sheer cliff a few loose stones disappear over the edge
[11450.28s -> 11459.37s]  and clatter away into the dark look for a way down rest until daylight uh i need stamina
[11459.37s -> 11485.35s]  stamina sun what would that do here how what would that do sun jewel oh so i can see down
[11485.35s -> 11494.58s]  oh i'm gonna do that doesn't cause i don't want to do anything that costs stamina looking to the
[11494.58s -> 11499.70s]  stars you craft the magic and the sun jewel in your back begins to pulse and throb with a brilliant
[11499.70s -> 11506.07s]  blinding light with the light from the jewel you look over the cliff and make out a set of
[11506.07s -> 11512.70s]  worn carved steps leading downwards it seems there definitely is a path here or there was
[11512.70s -> 11521.13s]  many hundreds or thousands of years ago climb down you creep towards the stone steps and begin
[11521.13s -> 11535.26s]  to make your way down okay that that works the cold night lingers on using the light from your
[11535.26s -> 11540.94s]  sun jewel you feel your way forward but halfway down the glow on the gem begins to fade you begin
[11540.94s -> 11552.82s]  to curse your decision to come this way throw the jewel no what i don't want to throw it this thing
[11552.82s -> 11561.48s]  is very very useful keep going you focus on placing your feet carefully and continue to make
[11561.48s -> 11567.51s]  your way down the cliff face like a goat the glow from your gem fades and you are plunged into
[11567.51s -> 11573.27s]  darkness once more the ground is closer than you realize and when the staircase runs out and turns
[11573.27s -> 11579.53s]  into loose scree it is a rough but thankfully short slide to the bottom you land with a thump
[11579.53s -> 11591.72s]  at the base of the cliff why would i have thrown the jewel you've reached the bottom of the cliff
[11592.17s -> 11598.30s]  the sky is already beginning to warm in the east the rock wall rises behind you cutting out half
[11598.30s -> 11604.94s]  the sky the staircase is now invisible just shadows on shadows in the craggy rock in the
[11604.94s -> 11609.83s]  near distance across the plains and away from the cliff you can see a dark shape jutting up from the
[11609.83s -> 11633.38s]  ground like a gigantic sword rest here out in the open in the dark zen hmm zip i don't have i could
[11633.38s -> 11641.40s]  teleport and get whatever the green ring is uh i might be okay that's one stamp anything free
[11642.20s -> 11660.20s]  what do i have that's free heel disease this is three this is a lot isn't it um i'll do how
[11662.47s -> 11670.52s]  because yeah let's do how i'm gonna die if i'm not careful you bind the starling to shape around you
[11670.52s -> 11675.96s]  and a familiar calm voice begins to speak voice tells you that the stairs are long since destroyed
[11675.96s -> 11700.02s]  and will never be rebuilt okay thanks i want safe passage not the history of the stairs i'll rest
[11700.02s -> 11707.48s]  let me look at the cliff you gaze up the soaring arc of the cliff barren rock dusted by what little
[11707.48s -> 11714.34s]  scrub can cling onto its sides it is as if some great clawed hand had scooped out the earth the
[11714.34s -> 11724.68s]  foot of the cliff is pitted with shadow holes no doubt dug by animals you peer through the gloom
[11725.32s -> 11730.28s]  trying to make out more details whatever the structure is it does not appear natural
[11730.28s -> 11737.34s]  but equally it does not appear to be intact seems to be sliding into the earth strange
[11737.34s -> 11748.92s]  the backlands were said to be uninhabited i i have to sleep we have to i have to rest here you find
[11748.92s -> 11755.34s]  an old fox hole and scramble inside at least you've eaten already today so do not need to
[11755.34s -> 11761.80s]  eat again to avoid hunger though more food will make you stronger you'll eat to eat once a day
[11761.80s -> 11775.38s]  all right close my eyes nothing bad nothing bad nothing bad nothing bad nothing bad you close your
[11775.38s -> 11781.43s]  eyes and let your tiredness overtake you the silence is loud in your ears slowly you're
[11781.43s -> 11787.96s]  understanding the true loneliness of this place you long for human company even the withering insults
[11787.96s -> 11802.17s]  of flanker but there is no one here you feel quite safe and you do not dream cliff face during the
[11802.17s -> 11809.59s]  past day you've become weaker reached the pit of the backlands and found four new clues you pull
[11809.59s -> 11819.18s]  yourself out of your hole and stand up okay i got two health nearby is a stone tower the only stone
[11819.18s -> 11825.91s]  structure in the whole barren landscape it is the shape you saw here at night look at the tower the
[11825.91s -> 11831.70s]  tower stands some way across the plane almost in the foothills of the ridge it lists to one side
[11831.70s -> 11840.17s]  but appears not to have crumbled into ruin move on this then is the plane of badubak an endless
[11840.17s -> 11846.44s]  expanse of dust broken only by the thin outline of an ancient road no one from aniland has been
[11846.44s -> 11853.67s]  here no one even knows what happened to this place once it was the archmage's country his fields and
[11853.67s -> 11863.16s]  paddocks and now it is too barren to even be a place of death what do we do this is quite this
[11863.16s -> 11877.11s]  is quite the early decision he just came and said what the fuck is happening all right uh i'll get
[11877.11s -> 11882.62s]  a poll going because we're either gonna go because let's let's give it a big picture here
[11882.62s -> 11897.29s]  where are they going this way right this way or this way so i'm it's going to be four choices but
[11897.29s -> 11911.45s]  i imagine yeah so ready pay attention one two three four again follow the cliff one into the
[11911.45s -> 11927.91s]  plane two follow this cliff three the old road four one two three four one two three four got it
[11927.91s -> 11946.54s]  again one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four
[11946.54s -> 11968.02s]  one two three four you got it two four three one four four three four four four two four two one
[11968.02s -> 11985.11s]  did i get it right did i get the code right where are we going baby sensory hey wait what was it
[11985.11s -> 11991.11s]  again i wasn't paying attention oh that's easy that it's four or you get all you get one or it's two
[11991.11s -> 12002.22s]  you go four or four or four or three all right let's go four you leave the shadow of the cliff
[12002.22s -> 12007.50s]  for the road that cuts across the plane the air stirs a little still cold but at least fresh
[12007.50s -> 12012.28s]  from here the path is uncertain badubak is a wasteland and there is no pass through
[12012.28s -> 12020.23s]  the great ridge that forms its eastern border the forest of snata is uncharted the zanzunu peaks
[12020.23s -> 12026.63s]  and mampang seem remote the forest of snata to the east of the ridge is uncharted and the
[12026.63s -> 12035.45s]  clatterback steps are said to be home only to under evolved half humans no tracks climb the horns
[12035.45s -> 12043.72s]  of ilk lala no tracks climb the horns of ilk lala that lie beyond the forest and there is no bridge
[12043.72s -> 12050.01s]  across the great lake beyond that there may be no road at all when the archmage sent his birdmen to
[12050.01s -> 12058.86s]  steal the crown of kings they flew but you must walk lala there is no alternative the future of
[12058.86s -> 12067.98s]  the old world depends on you finding your way across this lonely dust bowl jesus christ um
[12069.61s -> 12079.50s]  well we're okay strike out north the blasted tree along the road okay well we're going
[12079.50s -> 12085.90s]  we're not going this way you've already decided to go this way we're not going from here to here to
[12085.90s -> 12092.94s]  here you had a choice to go from here to here and you didn't choose it so we're going this way so
[12092.94s -> 12105.64s]  you do get a choice here though you get a one two three lala you didn't choose to go that way you
[12105.64s -> 12148.26s]  chose to go this way one two three one two three three two one two two two two three three three
[12148.26s -> 12155.54s]  three three three three three three three three three two two two two two two two two two two two
[12155.54s -> 12175.10s]  one two one one two one one two one one three one two one one one sick fucking beat hey dude i just
[12175.10s -> 12183.64s]  joined what's happening he said i actually just joined and i thought my computer was actually
[12183.64s -> 12191.06s]  glitching i got you i got you i got you all right we're going one and then i'm going to start
[12191.06s -> 12198.71s]  making some decisions you know what i mean we're going to the blasted tree you leave the road and
[12198.71s -> 12204.97s]  walk across the desolate plain a few clouds scut across the sky after a while of walking you see
[12204.97s -> 12211.14s]  something to break the monotony too tall and thin for a skewer of rock or a building you cannot
[12211.14s -> 12219.70s]  place it until you get close it's a single tree leafless and dead tilting from the desolate soil
[12219.70s -> 12226.74s]  climb the branches that seems the tree must be the last remnant of an ancient forest
[12226.74s -> 12232.04s]  the why this particular trunk has survived when all the others fell is not clear and that is not
[12232.04s -> 12243.90s]  all a rope ladder hangs from one of the higher branches of the tree okay climb the rope ladder
[12243.90s -> 12254.28s]  this is like a tree house you scramble up the rope ladder to get a view across the lands
[12254.28s -> 12260.18s]  but the branches seem to be alive twisting and bending as you climb they're closing in around
[12260.18s -> 12273.21s]  you like a trap untie the ladder it's like a three stooges routine okay untie the ladder
[12273.21s -> 12280.22s]  the knots holding the ladder to the branch are thick with age but you manage to work them free
[12280.22s -> 12285.51s]  the branch underneath seems to lift in relief that is as it is removed a moment later another
[12285.51s -> 12291.48s]  branch draws backwards behind you and releases knocking you painfully to the ground for a moment
[12291.48s -> 12316.50s]  you hear a sound almost like a laugh who's there stranger stranger show yourself there is no
[12316.50s -> 12324.10s]  response surely this land is a desert you're entirely alone are you not we'll find out
[12330.12s -> 12338.86s]  hmm to burn the tree i could burn the tree i could read minds which would be interesting
[12341.19s -> 12355.62s]  uh sense danger i think that's all we have i only have four hp so that would be bad let's read minds
[12355.62s -> 12364.79s]  it's free you weave the enchantment pulling on the cloth skullcap as you do you reach out with
[12364.79s -> 12372.55s]  your mind but what you find is not what you expect there are no humans or even any creatures in the
[12372.55s -> 12380.46s]  vicinity instead there is an intelligence something heavy and dark and thick the thoughts like ancient
[12380.46s -> 12401.96s]  oil talk or listen let's talk you reach out further trying to connect with this strange other presence
[12401.96s -> 12409.11s]  you seem to make no progress and then the spell fades and you open your eyes to find yourself
[12409.11s -> 12421.38s]  staring another pair formed by the curved twigs of the tree itself a face stranger
[12422.74s -> 12440.38s]  you are lost what makes you say who are you what are you be warned i will not be played with i am
[12440.38s -> 12458.63s]  a spirit and an old friend okay well how are you a friend can you guide me the branches flutter
[12458.63s -> 12465.85s]  and break in a sudden gust of wind the face disappearing for a moment you seek the whereabouts
[12465.85s -> 12479.16s]  of a shard rack of badubak uh yeah where where is he turn like a leaf in the morning
[12479.72s -> 12488.10s]  through the fish tail rock he is expecting you another strong breeze catches the branches and
[12488.10s -> 12501.19s]  disturbs them and when they settle the face has disappeared fish tail rock come back get back here
[12501.19s -> 12511.80s]  you mother fucker uh wait you wait a short while but it's no good you walk away from the shade of
[12511.80s -> 12521.69s]  the tree all right we got a clue fish tail rock all right let's keep going this way we're not
[12521.69s -> 12527.38s]  going back this way you've already made your choice east along the road i told you that was
[12527.38s -> 12539.34s]  a major decision can you pray to get healed i can i don't want to use it unless i have to though
[12539.34s -> 12543.74s]  you walk on across the plane until you meet the edge of an old road as the morning moves on the
[12543.74s -> 12550.42s]  wind begins to rise the road snakes across the dust bowl in the nearest in the near distance you
[12550.42s -> 12557.45s]  make out something through the haze not a tower but a spire of rock seems to flicker strangely
[12557.45s -> 12569.59s]  from behind you a voice says excuse me turn around you turn around to find the road deserted
[12569.59s -> 12578.49s]  there is no one in sight in any direction where are you you call half expecting flanker to
[12578.49s -> 12585.58s]  materialize up from the dust to greet you there's no reply the cold wind whistles around you the
[12585.58s -> 12596.70s]  planes feel suddenly far emptier than a moment before you continue along the ghost road okay
[12596.70s -> 12608.17s]  you get a choice one or two one two one two one is towards the cliff two is head up east this way
[12608.17s -> 12617.64s]  and go so one is to go down probably here over here two is to go like here one is cliff two is
[12617.64s -> 12625.42s]  head east what do you think what do you think what do you think what do you think what do you think
[12625.42s -> 12664.18s]  what do you think please can you hit the two button a lot again uh no um no sorry no uh it's close
[12664.18s -> 12681.59s]  very close can you please hit the three button three i'll give you that i mean i'll give i'll
[12681.59s -> 12688.87s]  give you this too right like two no yeah i'll give you one a lot of you guys don't want to go to the
[12688.87s -> 12696.82s]  cliff interesting okay i don't remember what this is i don't remember what this is either i of all
[12696.82s -> 12704.41s]  the games forget these next two parts more than anything kare is my favorite so i obviously
[12704.41s -> 12712.54s]  remember a lot of stuff but i don't remember very much from this very much gone from my brain
[12712.54s -> 12723.10s]  all right we're going east you follow the old road the sun is hot now the road forks here with the
[12723.10s -> 12728.78s]  main path snaking up the mountainside of the east rocks have tumbled down the slope and all but cover
[12728.78s -> 12734.97s]  the road you cast your gaze east toward the towering badu back ridge the main peak is lost
[12734.97s -> 12741.26s]  in the haze at the end of the long winding road that climbs up the slope looking north the road
[12741.26s -> 12747.90s]  winds along the rocky edges of the foothills our particularly impressive stone stupa stands out a
[12747.90s -> 12760.82s]  little way along stone shift and move underfoot as you walk i mean two was cliff we talked about
[12760.82s -> 12780.95s]  two is the road all right i'm gonna make this decision this way heading towards the clatterbox
[12780.95s -> 12799.75s]  steps or up here into more of this kind of plains area let's go up the ground underfoot
[12799.75s -> 12805.82s]  turns into rocks and scree the sun has reached its highest point now out of the shade the air
[12805.82s -> 12812.46s]  is baking hot you pause to rest in the shadow of a large rock spire that sticks out from the dirt
[12812.46s -> 12820.39s]  like a claw through cloth the rock is a single shattered spire perhaps once part of the mountain
[12820.39s -> 12826.58s]  range to the east or perhaps driven up through the ground by some geological quirk at the base
[12826.58s -> 12835.27s]  of the rock is the mouth of a cave perhaps stuffed with buried treasure you approach the cave with
[12835.27s -> 12841.78s]  one hand on your blade the cave appears to go back some distance into pitch blackness someone
[12841.78s -> 12848.12s]  seems to have scratched a message into the rock inside the cave it is only just legible and must
[12848.12s -> 12857.14s]  be ancient in the thin sunlight falling into the cave you can make out the ancient scratch message
[12857.14s -> 12868.49s]  with some difficulty stranger i am waiting very long ago summon you call my name to the skies and
[12868.49s -> 12883.48s]  i will draw the message on the cave wall suggested calling out a name but what name should you call
[12883.48s -> 12902.86s]  flanker where are you shadrack jan well imagine calling jan's name here i mean we're gonna do
[12902.86s -> 12909.77s]  this right because that's shadrack you cry the name across the plains and the echo of it seems
[12909.77s -> 12915.46s]  to set off a distant avalanche the ground begins to shake and rumble and you stagger to your knees
[12915.46s -> 12920.97s]  the very earth is moving as though it was splitting or merging back together you reach down to steady
[12920.97s -> 12931.45s]  yourself only to find that the grass is growing between your fingers you pick yourself unsteadily
[12931.45s -> 12938.28s]  to your feet feeling sick and unwell everything around you is the same but everything is different
[12938.28s -> 12946.14s]  the rock has two spires for one thing the cave seems smaller and darker and in a fire pit built
[12946.14s -> 12957.77s]  into the scrub is its mouth is a fire burning from inside you hear the gentle sound of singing are
[12957.77s -> 12975.62s]  you guys starting to understand why a part three is cool and you will soon you guys just got elden
[12975.62s -> 12988.49s]  ringed yep there it is you got elden ringed again let me take a few guesses okay uh we're
[12988.49s -> 12994.54s]  gonna listen you stop and listen the singer is a man with a voice like gravel moving over ice
[12994.54s -> 13001.42s]  he sings in a language you do not recognize what its tune feels at once arresting an ancient and
[13001.42s -> 13014.90s]  the melody seems to soothe your soul you approach the fire call out for shadrack shadrack i am here
[13014.90s -> 13022.20s]  the singing stops abruptly there's a coughing and a wheezing sound and then an old man hobbles from
[13022.20s -> 13029.83s]  outside the cave limping on a stick this must be shadrack himself but you recognize the face as
[13029.83s -> 13040.04s]  that of the tree spirit you met earlier ah it's you i have been expecting you he waves a hand
[13040.04s -> 13056.33s]  around the landscape welcome back welcome back just so you have come a long long way my anilander
[13057.46s -> 13068.87s]  i know your mission of course i know all about you and you know about me i hope my name is shadrack
[13068.87s -> 13077.16s]  oh i i it was worth keeping show him the eagle's message you pulled the message from your pack i
[13077.16s -> 13087.19s]  was given this it mentions you hmm the diviners are most impressive or perhaps our meeting has
[13087.19s -> 13095.53s]  simply been remembered yes that is more likely then his eyes narrow on as he reads seven serpents
[13095.53s -> 13109.08s]  yes now i see why they have sent you to me can you help that depends hmm i know you journey here
[13109.08s -> 13119.45s]  from clare tell me how fares that city it stands still the same as always it stands still same as
[13119.45s -> 13133.02s]  always you have to call it the same as always right i've i've it stands sad track nods deeply
[13133.02s -> 13140.04s]  i watched an army of marsh goblins scale the cliffs armed with swords and axes there should
[13140.04s -> 13146.31s]  be smoke rising at the horizon but i see no such thing he grabs a handful of dry grass from the
[13146.31s -> 13151.53s]  ground and tosses it into the fire pit where it blazes for a moment into flame he appears to
[13151.53s -> 13159.16s]  change topic i must warn you that no one from aniland has ever crossed the backlands alone
[13159.16s -> 13174.71s]  and survived the serpents yes but not only them the very rocks and earth here are lost things
[13174.71s -> 13185.00s]  become unstuck and you have now become unstuck yourself i i don't understand he demonstrated
[13185.00s -> 13190.44s]  with his finger as he speaks twisting them together the old world in the ancient world
[13190.44s -> 13201.27s]  have grown together like thorny bushes to journey through one is to journey through the other you
[13201.27s -> 13209.13s]  have any do you have any food the ancient world you ask looking about yourself with the fields of
[13209.13s -> 13217.99s]  grass that have appeared to replace the desert istara the place that was my home you are most
[13217.99s -> 13230.78s]  welcome unexpectedly shadrach stumbles he smiles at you weakly oh are you unwell this whole land
[13230.78s -> 13239.27s]  is unwell i will not be able to stay for very long please ask me what you need to know and then
[13239.27s -> 13248.97s]  leave you play swindle stones you come all of this way to speak with me and you want to do it by
[13248.97s -> 13259.96s]  playing dice why don't we talk oh you're just afraid i'm gonna win i do not think so and what
[13259.96s -> 13265.34s]  do you think you have to gain playing swindle stones against a telepath is beyond even my
[13265.34s -> 13274.38s]  cogniz do you have any food my my three wishes right i asked the genie asked the mage the
[13274.38s -> 13282.87s]  questions i'm hungry i want a car and um replace the toilet paper in my bathroom because it's low
[13282.87s -> 13292.26s]  why could i ask for anything worse i could get the answers to the universe do you have any food
[13292.26s -> 13303.26s]  that actually is important i am too holy to eat but if you can reach karyama north of the river
[13303.26s -> 13309.67s]  you may be able to eat well there if it still exists in your time most likely it does not
[13309.67s -> 13316.28s]  shadrach is shivering slightly now his face is pale beyond the ruddy beard how did this curse come
[13316.28s -> 13324.54s]  to be the land was cursed by the archmage to be forgotten and so it has been and so it will be
[13324.54s -> 13334.23s]  not long now and then all you will see will be gone only timeless desolation will remain but why
[13336.46s -> 13343.42s]  because of you the archmage punished this whole land to make a trap to kill you before you could
[13343.42s -> 13354.52s]  kill him he is a dangerous enemy and he is quite desperate uh i understand he has sent seven
[13354.52s -> 13364.95s]  serpents to kill me the hermit nods most seriously the serpents are most terrible i have often seen
[13364.95s -> 13373.19s]  them but they are no mere snakes do you know of their legend tell me i don't care just tell me how
[13373.19s -> 13386.87s]  to tell me yes i can do that better it is said that thousands of years from now a few years ago
[13386.87s -> 13394.84s]  for you perhaps the archmage of manpeng often slew a mighty hydra which dwelt in the caves of
[13394.84s -> 13400.58s]  high salmon so formidable a foe was his creature that the archmage took its seven heads back to
[13400.58s -> 13407.03s]  manpeng where he used his dark arch to resurrect them as seven winged serpents they became his
[13407.03s -> 13417.05s]  personal messengers his assassins his force in a dark place thousands of years from now indeed so
[13417.05s -> 13424.07s]  look about you i fancied this valley was not green with grass when you entered it he's right
[13424.07s -> 13435.86s]  it is the same valley and yet not the same i don't understand what has happened how much
[13435.86s -> 13444.34s]  you ever lost on swindle stones i need to get a better mic guys there are no other mics that
[13444.34s -> 13456.54s]  are better than these you understand i'm not talking through like a fucking $40 desk microphone
[13456.54s -> 13463.99s]  there's no there are there are no other mics that exist that are better than this they don't exist

[14306.87s -> 14312.23s]  hangs in the air you muse on what you have seen it seems there is more to the backlands than
[14312.23s -> 14320.39s]  there first appeared you are left alone by the cave mouth once more yeah well take some stuff
[14320.39s -> 14325.66s]  from the cave you look into the cave again and this time find a strange horn hanging from a hook
[14325.66s -> 14332.23s]  on the wall it is ordinately carved from strange twisting shell for the height of leather it is a
[14332.23s -> 14347.64s]  gale horn one of very few in existence you lift it down with great care what are they saying over
[14347.64s -> 14355.75s]  here are they saying that word that i said not to say how dare they i can't believe they're

[14375.42s -> 14384.92s]  and blow a note it is a clean and mellow pitched and makes the air stir with echoes it is both
[14384.92s -> 14394.94s]  powerful and likely to be valuable should you decide to sell it you pause to look around the
[14395.02s -> 14400.87s]  plane then scrub grass stretches away north and west to the east the mountains are shadowing the
[14400.87s -> 14407.61s]  sun the whole world seems to have come alive around but surely this magic cannot last you make your
[14407.61s -> 14412.38s]  way back to the old road that runs past the rock to the north you catch a glimpse of the tower
[14412.38s -> 14418.58s]  shadrach mentioned covered in green ivy west you notice a young tree that surely wasn't there
[14418.58s -> 14446.86s]  before sick so this is the tree that we were at before let's go see it now you head out across
[14446.86s -> 14453.45s]  the prairie the sun begins to dip heading towards the horizon you swat at pestering flies and
[14453.45s -> 14460.73s]  images the dead tree you saw here earlier is now a young strong sapling in its shadow a woman sits
[14460.73s -> 14473.35s]  cross-legged with eyes closed you watch the woman for a moment she's breathing in and out slowly
[14473.35s -> 14479.90s]  and murmuring under her breath perhaps she's praying around her neck she wears what looks
[14479.90s -> 14486.82s]  like a giant's tooth on a leather string i've got a few of those a fleet of long thin birds
[14486.82s -> 14498.02s]  swoop and career overhead snatching flies from the steamy air steal the tooth i have enough uh i

[14999.00s -> 15004.94s]  of the cliff you came down when you enter the backlands but quite why is not clear then she
[15004.94s -> 15014.01s]  hurries away the tree is relatively young fresh and strong as though it has been only planted a
[15014.01s -> 15020.14s]  few minutes before it is hard to believe this is the same tree that you saw before so tall and so
[15020.14s -> 15029.11s]  very dead but the position is the same with the woman gone you look around the plane south and
[15029.11s -> 15034.39s]  west the great fault line of the cliff shields out the sky and at its top it seems as dark as
[15034.39s -> 15040.63s]  night north the grass stretches away towards a distant flashing line that seems to cut across
[15040.63s -> 15058.84s]  the land you turn your attention back to the landscape sweet create a paradox all right so
[15058.84s -> 15074.78s]  where are we going back to the road let's go up north i'm gonna head north you walk on across the
[15074.78s -> 15080.38s]  grassland until you join an old road the sun is sinking and the sky is turning bruised purple
[15080.38s -> 15087.14s]  it will be night soon again already away from the road to the northeast the curious stone tower you
[15087.14s -> 15100.49s]  saw earlier stands alone overlooking the river towards the tower towards the tower the road
[15100.49s -> 15109.11s]  north uh go yeah the tower i we i'm gonna go to the tower because i want to show people something
[15109.11s -> 15115.19s]  interesting you step off the well-paved road and cut across the grassy fields that have somehow
[15115.19s -> 15121.02s]  replaced the plane that was here before the sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky soon it
[15121.02s -> 15126.95s]  will be dark you reach the shadow of the tower you spotted while climbing down the cliff its sides
[15126.95s -> 15133.51s]  are too smooth to be natural and that there are no stones or brickwork like a gigantic game piece
[15133.59s -> 15138.33s]  carved from a single block of stone thick gripweed curls up and around the tower like
[15138.33s -> 15151.14s]  wool round a bobbin beyond it a river pushes past look for a door tug the gripweed look at the river
[15151.14s -> 15161.53s]  what's available please my father the sweetest chef demands your opinions on cast iron or he
[15161.53s -> 15169.16s]  will flame you on twitter okay cast iron is a okay here's the thing about cast iron it's probably

[15173.96s -> 15205.75s]  heavy it is to do dope to do zen if i had the jewel i don't can you put it in the dishwasher
[15206.39s -> 15215.13s]  i don't think so we can't hear you laugh anymore it gets cut off yeah i'll i'll eventually fix the
[15215.13s -> 15219.29s]  cut off thing i have no idea why that's happening that's what that's this mic problem that didn't
[15219.29s -> 15228.31s]  happen with the other mic so i gotta figure out why that's happening um what do i do what do i do
[15228.39s -> 15236.07s]  what do i do what do i do do do why don't you we're gonna cat look for a door you walk a full
[15236.07s -> 15243.32s]  circuit of the tower hoping to find a doorway but there is nothing to see the tower sides are made
[15243.32s -> 15251.51s]  of solid stone if indeed it is a tower on the very top something metal glints in the sunshine
[15251.51s -> 15257.45s]  listen now you agree well i think the mic sounds fine it's just sometimes i get cut off when i make
[15257.45s -> 15263.53s]  a loud screeching noise i think it sounds beautiful right now don't you agree don't you agree agree
[15263.53s -> 15278.46s]  with me don't you agree uh tug the gripweed you give the gripweed shoots a sharp tug the plant
[15278.46s -> 15285.51s]  is tough as rope and seems to be firmly anchored into the stone of the tower uh look at the glint
[15286.07s -> 15290.23s]  craning your neck and squinting against the sun you try to make out what the gleam is
[15291.22s -> 15297.61s]  some kind of brass fitting seems to jut out over the side strange to see worked metal and stone
[15297.61s -> 15305.72s]  out here wasn't this place supposed to be barren you pause for a while watching the river rushing
[15305.72s -> 15311.72s]  past the sound is calming even though it is on the far side that the plains continue then somehow
[15311.72s -> 15326.39s]  you must cross climb up climb the gripweed quickly you grab the gripweed and scramble up the outside
[15326.39s -> 15331.83s]  of the tower the roots of the thick plant offer plenty of footholds and the ascent is easy enough
[15332.63s -> 15339.21s]  soon you are hauling yourself over the battlements onto the top of the tower at the top of the tower
[15341.43s -> 15345.75s]  you stand atop the tower the wind across the prairie whips at your hood and the ground seems
[15345.75s -> 15355.54s]  like an endless green sea far below remember this game has screen shake don't interrupt me
[15355.54s -> 15362.02s]  but the top is not empty indeed there is barely room to stand most of the floor space is taken
[15362.02s -> 15370.07s]  up by a large brass contraption that has been built into the middle of the roof look at the
[15370.07s -> 15374.47s]  contraption in the tower this tower was clearly built to house the brass contraption in the center
[15374.47s -> 15381.27s]  of the turret you look it over with curious interest a large brass cylinder it is set into
[15381.27s -> 15387.64s]  the bearing in the center of the tower and protrudes a short way over the battlement it
[15387.64s -> 15393.93s]  is rather like one of the chief mages telescopes but why would anyone set such a complex device
[15393.93s -> 15403.54s]  out here in the wastes you crouch to look through the cylinder but find you cannot it has no eyepiece
[15403.54s -> 15409.66s]  the near end disappears unbroken into the brass mounting of the device the bearing underneath the
[15409.66s -> 15414.47s]  cylinder looks as though it might allow the contraption to move furthermore set in the
[15414.47s -> 15422.14s]  central dome is an impressive looking blue crystal the blue crystal is not a gem you recognize
[15422.14s -> 15430.76s]  it pulses with a small interior glow as though something lived inside you touch the crystal
[15430.76s -> 15435.72s]  but as your fingers brush the glass something happens and you feel yourself whipped up into
[15435.72s -> 15441.61s]  the air as though catapulted for a dizzy moment you seem to stare down at the entire land of
[15441.61s -> 15450.01s]  badubak then a moment later you're back on your feet head reeling but feeling curiously powerful
[15450.01s -> 15459.08s]  touch it again you reach out to touch the crystal again only to catch yourself the blue crystal on
[15459.08s -> 15464.44s]  the contraption is flashing brilliantly and then suddenly the cylinder ignites with a thick beam
[15464.44s -> 15469.02s]  of syrupy light the beam floods across the landscape cutting through the mists and warping
[15469.02s -> 15480.81s]  the view like a heat haze the land in the light of the beam has changed it seems the magic you
[15480.81s -> 15488.23s]  witnessed earlier is happening again birds wheel and tumble in the air a short distance away
[15488.23s -> 15496.73s]  ladies and gentlemen welcome to why this is the coolest potentially of the three episodes it is
[15497.46s -> 15512.38s]  two maps on top of each other one in the past and one in the present and you can traverse them
[15512.38s -> 15533.05s]  however you see fit get elden ringed so the question is where do i want to point this
[15533.05s -> 15543.19s]  down in the water over here to the bridge so i can cross over here straight down over against this
[15543.19s -> 15562.71s]  thing uh i could also make this back to normal what do you guys think the cave this is a flop
[15562.71s -> 15581.00s]  episode come on it's a flop well let's put it over here first right or we could try to cross it
[15581.00s -> 15587.78s]  without it without the water and without the bridge and aim it this way or go across here first and
[15587.78s -> 15603.19s]  try to get over there back in time cave cave cave cave all right we'll do the cave i'll point it back
[15603.19s -> 15612.10s]  here you adjust the beam around its track sweeping light over the land below the view is now partially
[15612.10s -> 15616.66s]  lit with the beam from the tower and a different land appears in its light birds fly gentle wind
[15616.66s -> 15627.94s]  stirs pollen in a haze the various towers across the game you aim them that's how you do it there
[15627.94s -> 15632.90s]  we go with the beacon blazing away you swing yourself over the battlement once more after an
[15632.90s -> 15640.62s]  uncertain moment you find the grip weed and clamor swiftly down back to the tower's base you scramble
[15640.62s -> 15647.61s]  down the tower and drop the last few feet to the ground and you leave south of here the grand road
[15647.61s -> 15656.22s]  runs from west to east across the plain so that is what we have opened back up is over here this
[15656.22s -> 15672.60s]  road is now back in time i think it was a thousand couple thousand years ago let's go back uh the
[15672.60s -> 15680.26s]  road west i think we can cross this now you return to the road night falls you should find somewhere
[15680.26s -> 15685.06s]  safe to sleep if you keep going through the night you'll be weaker for it especially after so long
[15685.06s -> 15692.98s]  walking with an empty belly uh i'm if i can make it i think i can hang out maybe in the cave
[15693.70s -> 15700.92s]  you abandon the road and walk across the suddenly grassy field the moon rises filling the world
[15700.92s -> 15707.10s]  with thin silver light you crest a low rise and look down across the grass offering something of
[15707.10s -> 15715.40s]  a view looking north a wide river splashes spray into the air south you can make out
[15715.40s -> 15721.18s]  elthera's tree and east the road makes a loop past the foothills of badobak ridge passing an
[15721.18s -> 15728.42s]  unusual double spiked rock formation and that's all there is to see so we're gonna head back
[15728.42s -> 15739.11s]  towards the cave and it's really really sweet all right here we go you make your slow way across
[15739.11s -> 15746.95s]  the virgin grassland this then is the pit of the backlands it is not as fearsome as you had expected
[15746.95s -> 15753.64s]  or maybe the sludge and grime of kare has toughened your resolve indeed in this strange magical light
[15753.64s -> 15759.70s]  it is almost pleasant east of the badobak ridge lie the clatterback steps which you must cross
[15759.70s -> 15770.31s]  to reach the lake return to the cliff once more you enter the shadow of the cliffs that surround
[15770.31s -> 15776.39s]  this place the stars are flooding the sky the grass meadow ends by the cliff base and the
[15776.39s -> 15783.29s]  carved stone steps that lead away from the backlands i do need to sleep you find an old fox
[15783.29s -> 15787.29s]  hole and scramble inside you've not eaten today but you have no rations so you're gonna have to
[15787.29s -> 15792.28s]  just deal with it you lie back and try to forget your troubles you're protected here
[15792.28s -> 15801.62s]  and your rest is untroubled by dream you gain considerable stamina and met shadrach the hermit
[15801.62s -> 15811.75s]  all right here we go you pull yourself out of your hole and stand up the grass meadow ends by the
[15811.75s -> 15817.54s]  cliff base and the carved stone steps that lead away from the backlands go up the steps you haul
[15817.54s -> 15827.10s]  yourself onto the first of the gigantic steps that leads up the cliff face halfway up it's been two
[15827.10s -> 15832.71s]  days and you're exactly where you started yep but just like a thousand years in the past you clamor
[15832.71s -> 15838.89s]  up the carved rock it is painstaking work as every step is about the height of your own body
[15838.89s -> 15846.23s]  then about halfway up you pause to rest near the entrance to a cave the cave is clearly inhabited
[15846.23s -> 15858.47s]  a cloth hangs across the opening let's go you push back the cloth hanging and enter the cave
[15858.47s -> 15868.47s]  inside welcome murmurs a voice from the shadows at the far end of the space who's there i am armed
[15868.47s -> 15876.84s]  or greetings don't we we know who lives here didn't l theorist say it was her cave i was
[15876.84s -> 15886.38s]  gonna say it um you're enabling him yeah i didn't say it who's there you call waiting for your eyes
[15886.38s -> 15892.98s]  to readjust so you can see you hear footsteps patting forward over sand and then a shambling
[15892.98s -> 15902.42s]  figure appears a woman with crazed white hair wearing rags of animal skin you i had no idea
[15902.42s -> 15908.10s]  i would see you again her voice is familiar from somewhere but you've not met anyone so old since
[15908.10s -> 15919.16s]  the witch above the waterfall in the shuman tanti hills do you know me of course you've not changed
[15919.24s -> 15926.89s]  a bit or i was so young i was rather in love with you as i recall wait with that she steps
[15926.89s -> 15931.91s]  forward once more coming into the thin moonlight at the entrance of the cave you gasp though this
[15931.91s -> 15938.78s]  woman is old beyond imagining you recognize her face it is l thera with whom you were playing
[15938.78s -> 15947.53s]  dice only hours before how is this possible you demand afraid of whatever curse had befallen her
[15947.53s -> 15955.58s]  she laughs it is this not normal where you come from with my people we change this way as time
[15955.58s -> 15963.27s]  passes it's quite normal how long ago did we meet you ask horrified by what the answer might be
[15964.79s -> 15974.18s]  when we met i was barely 16 and now let me see i suppose i am 113 if you don't count the year
[15974.18s -> 15982.26s]  i spent as an eagle she shrugs sadly but welcome all the same perhaps you are thirsty from a corner
[15982.26s -> 15991.51s]  of the cave she produces a jug which has been catching water dripping down the stone thank you
[15991.51s -> 15998.22s]  she pours you a cup and you drink gratefully and quickly feel thoroughly refreshed it's been
[15998.22s -> 16006.14s]  barely any time since i last met you can you tell me about the serpents do you have any provisions
[16006.14s -> 16020.23s]  how can i cross the backlands eagle fursona yeah the last time i met i was in oh yeah the last
[16020.23s -> 16028.20s]  time we were at that fur con and i was in my fucking eagle costume weren't you a gopher yeah
[16028.20s -> 16036.63s]  i was a gopher i thought i knew i knew you from somewhere uh all right can you uh it's been
[16036.63s -> 16043.72s]  barely let's get let's get some some lore here it's been barely any time since i last met you
[16043.72s -> 16051.18s]  well then the curse on this land affects me but not you perhaps you will be able to leave unlike
[16051.18s -> 16059.46s]  the others what others the others all the others that survive the new crown they wander the
[16059.46s -> 16071.37s]  wilderness and circle is lost endlessly repeating themselves quite unstuck any provisions uh i do
[16071.37s -> 16082.98s]  not eat i sustain myself through passive thought it is a pure existence can you train me if you
[16083.06s -> 16087.78s]  have 50 years to spend in practice but i do not have so long i fear
[16090.09s -> 16100.58s]  you're a sorcerer are you not i'm a student of magic she nods there is a secret known only to
[16100.58s -> 16106.31s]  the most powerful sorcerers in this land the sorcerers of the fortress know it i am sure
[16106.31s -> 16117.29s]  but they've tried to keep it a secret would you like to hear it yeah uh if there are nods in
[16117.29s -> 16124.54s]  return it is said you see that sorcery is unstoppable powerful the sorcerers tell us
[16124.54s -> 16132.09s]  that magic controls the world's very warp and weft that once woven a spell cannot be unwound
[16132.09s -> 16146.55s]  the claim is bold but i have learned it is also untrue magic can be undone magic some magic perhaps
[16146.55s -> 16154.65s]  all magic can be countered just as the parrying blade can stop a sword i have discovered one such
[16154.65s -> 16161.90s]  counter spell already the spell of the healing opposes the enchantment of the fireball i believe
[16161.90s -> 16168.54s]  if one can recognize the spell being cast and one knows the form then one can prevent that spell
[16168.54s -> 16177.91s]  with the cast of the other counter spells what about the most powerful spells i have not tested
[16177.91s -> 16184.17s]  it but yes perhaps even the most powerful spell can be undone as she speaks she draws a shape in
[16184.17s -> 16193.61s]  the air a horizontal line a diagonal another line it is the letter z interesting what does
[16193.61s -> 16203.70s]  z can you tell me about the serpents seven serpents suddenly her face is alive with activity
[16203.70s -> 16207.80s]  and she hobbles back into the depths of her cave returning a moment later clicking her fingers
[16207.80s -> 16213.77s]  i have seen this i have seen this in the stars about the seven serpents turns the fate of man
[16213.77s -> 16219.32s]  and about that turns the fate of the world i thought the seven serpents were stars
[16219.32s -> 16231.16s]  up there the seven serpents are real they are most powerful they're all but indestructible if you see
[16231.16s -> 16239.69s]  one of these serpents stranger i believe that you must run i have killed many serpents this is
[16239.69s -> 16256.89s]  definitely going in this voice acting sizzle reel true i have killed many serpents not such
[16256.89s -> 16263.26s]  as these each of the seven serpents is sliced from the head of a hydra each is bound to an
[16263.26s -> 16272.04s]  element of the world fire or air or earth or time she waves a hand that sort of thing and each only
[16272.04s -> 16280.79s]  has one weakness what weakness a different weakness in each serpent you must know them to kill them
[16280.79s -> 16287.94s]  but to know them is to be killed by them and the whole land turns on this so the whole land must
[16287.94s -> 16299.05s]  surely fall woman sits down quite suddenly in a state of some despair they all have pokemon
[16299.05s -> 16306.74s]  weaknesses yeah you approach her hoping to console her but she does not react to your presence she
[16306.74s -> 16315.24s]  does not even blink the woman murmurs softly to herself look around the cave you glance around
[16315.24s -> 16320.84s]  the cave althera has few possessions to speak of but your interest is taken more by the dust
[16321.00s -> 16329.18s]  that covers the floor stone dust can be very valuable for magic you scrape together a handful
[16329.18s -> 16333.82s]  is worth of stone dust between your palms and slip it into your money pouch for safe keeping
[16333.82s -> 16341.10s]  the woman's third eye seems to glow momentarily you step away from the old woman and look about
[16341.10s -> 16351.53s]  for where to go next then quite suddenly she grabs your leg but it will take some time to search
[16351.53s -> 16375.88s]  come back then her eyes roll up into her skull keep going stepping carefully past the catatonic
[16375.88s -> 16381.11s]  woman you make your way further into the back of the cave after a narrow passage it opens out to
[16381.11s -> 16388.41s]  reveal a wide space lit by a torchlight the walls are covered with scratched writing curious symbols
[16388.41s -> 16406.92s]  and glyphs all in the same shaky hand a little dust trickles from the ceiling be careful here
[16406.92s -> 16426.66s]  sus rock turn to stone how probably sus right yeah that's definitely play consulting the
[16426.66s -> 16432.17s]  constellations above you bind the spell and a quiet voice enters your mind it assures you
[16432.17s -> 16438.94s]  that the cave is quite safe and the woman who lives here can be trusted but it advises you
[16438.94s -> 16445.27s]  she will have nothing to tell you until long after she is dead that strange message delivered
[16445.27s -> 16452.65s]  the voice fades some of the glyphs on the walls are split you notice like cracked crazed cracks
[16452.65s -> 16460.87s]  in the stone you look more closely at the cracks in the walls it is as though the cliff itself is
[16460.87s -> 16466.74s]  slowly shearing apart one crack in particular spiders the ceiling and threatens to bring the
[16466.74s -> 16474.25s]  roof down looking more closely you see why it is filled with a seam of some soft metal
[16474.25s -> 16485.69s]  which is slowly wearing away intrigued by the writing you look over some symbols they're a
[16485.69s -> 16492.28s]  mixture of star signs letters numbers and shapes you do not recognize there's no order it is as
[16492.28s -> 16497.77s]  though their scribe was desperately trying to capture as much as possible of a dream before
[16497.77s -> 16503.19s]  it was forgotten the results are quite indecipherable especially in the near darkness
[16503.19s -> 16513.80s]  and barely any space is left only one patch of blank stone near the base of the wall um
[16513.80s -> 16532.33s]  probably sun get a closer look right it's free you wind the stars into order around you the
[16532.33s -> 16536.73s]  sun jewel starts to give off a magical white glow the glow picks out details in the glyphs
[16536.73s -> 16543.30s]  and carvings of the wall letting you read several more clearly the bridge will fall
[16543.30s -> 16556.38s]  and the river become a chasm reads one the blood candle must not be lit do not eat from the larder
[16556.38s -> 16569.67s]  of a frog okay sounds important uh look at the blank stone you squat down to look at the blank
[16569.67s -> 16575.59s]  stone but see nothing it is natural rock only remarkable because every other surface has been
[16575.59s -> 16582.95s]  etched or carved above the blank section is drawn a rude outline of a snake followed by a hand and
[16582.95s -> 16600.74s]  two vertical lines a son again will this kill us both dig out the metal seam you dig at the metal
[16600.74s -> 16605.48s]  seam with your sword it is worthless tin and comes away easily there's a noise like rumbling
[16605.48s -> 16611.42s]  thundering the stones above shift perceptively quickly you put your sword away before you bring
[16611.42s -> 16634.71s]  the rocks down on your head what else can i do summon darkness so why would i do that no rock
[16634.71s -> 16663.50s]  can do sun again uh what does this do you craft the spell and billows of black smoke emerge quickly
[16663.50s -> 16668.65s]  from under your cloak the back of the cave plunges into thick darkness the torch on the wall
[16668.65s -> 16678.55s]  disappearing completely from view you wait and after a few minutes the spell fades and the fog
[16678.55s -> 16687.53s]  dissipates once more it's there for no reason i may as well just have put my back up against a wall
[16688.09s -> 16697.51s]  standing straight up standing back flush to the wall heels against the wall head against the wall
[16697.51s -> 16704.09s]  and just tilt my head down and then throw it back fucking hard and hit my fucking head against the
[16704.09s -> 16712.97s]  wall i just did the set that's what i just did i did the same thing and then just leave i just
[16712.97s -> 16719.61s]  took damage for no reason all right you head back out of the cave avoiding a cascade of small stones
[16719.61s -> 16734.39s]  from a crack in the ceiling as you go you return from the rear of the cave the light from your sun
[16734.39s -> 16740.47s]  jewel pulses twice and fades althera is still here squatting in one corner and rocking quietly
[16740.47s -> 16749.27s]  what do the symbols on the walls of the cave mean she shakes her head too much to see not enough
[16749.27s -> 16789.80s]  space enough space okay um can i make the space bigger i'm going back here uh how can't do far
[16792.86s -> 16800.73s]  log i don't think this if i could i but i don't have the right turn to strike do it turn to stone
[16805.43s -> 16809.99s]  i wonder what this does how much stone dust do i have i don't want to waste it i mean i just
[16809.99s -> 16822.01s]  picked it up off of her ground i'm gonna use it here all right i get a rewind if it doesn't
[16822.01s -> 16834.98s]  do anything i'm gonna rewind if it doesn't do anything
[16841.74s -> 16845.58s]  reaching up to the stars you create the magic across a handful of stone dust
[16845.66s -> 16850.46s]  and you feel the potential of magic entering your palm you have a few seconds to decide what to do
[16850.46s -> 16861.74s]  with it toss the stone dust onto the metal in the crack or toss it into the air you toss the stone
[16861.74s -> 16866.70s]  dust at the soft metal that fills the stone crack it bonds instantly and soon the cracks themselves
[16866.70s -> 16872.47s]  have turned to stone healing the join whether this will be enough to protect althera's home
[16872.47s -> 16884.81s]  you cannot be sure is that a good thing was that good did i prevent her roof from caving in or
[16884.81s -> 16904.76s]  something i'm gonna live with that uh althera is still here lost in thought okay all right let's
[16904.76s -> 16914.92s]  get out of here the view below is quite giddying you're one step from plunging to the pit floor
[16914.92s -> 16926.79s]  okay so we can go we'll go up through here maybe maybe i'll should i go no i'm gonna go check this
[16926.79s -> 16936.06s]  out in the uh in the present uh this is this will be the present so we'll go up i could also come
[16936.06s -> 16955.13s]  back here in the present time let's do that uh move on so let's let's let's see what happens i'm
[16955.13s -> 16968.62s]  gonna take the thing away we'll go back again you carry on across the grassland enjoying the
[16968.62s -> 16974.06s]  soft chirping of the insects the mid-afternoon heat floods the valley from behind you a voice says
[16974.06s -> 16981.29s]  excuse me this happened already just ignore it you ignore it another mirage like the one you heard
[16981.29s -> 16990.14s]  before excuse me are you deaf all right you turn around to find a small boy holding a black face
[16990.14s -> 17007.13s]  mask in his hand he pushes it towards you where did you get that you dropped it the boy says
[17007.13s -> 17016.28s]  thank you you nod your head and thanks the boy smiles puts the face mask into your hands then
[17016.28s -> 17030.50s]  he steps back and waits for something um what do you want like a reward offer him a reward
[17030.50s -> 17044.57s]  you look in your pack for a suitable reward um here here's three gold okay the boy smile grows
[17044.57s -> 17051.54s]  wide at the site thank you by thruff i'm glad i followed you i mean that i was here you know
[17051.62s -> 17057.08s]  what i mean he puts the gold into his pocket you squat down onto your ankles to be more at
[17057.08s -> 17067.48s]  the boy's level he's clearly local and is likely to know a lot about the area where are you from
[17067.48s -> 17080.42s]  you ask the boy kare but i run errands all the way to tin pang sometimes where's tin pang across
[17080.42s -> 17085.88s]  the marsh over the bridge near the lake you can run there in almost a day the idea that this boy
[17085.88s -> 17093.30s]  can cross the entire of the backlands is startling this is the most dangerous land you know the boy
[17093.30s -> 17111.98s]  is starting to look twitchy what do you know of the seven serpents nothing sounds like one of
[17111.98s -> 17125.75s]  shadrach stories the boy hops from foot to foot so you know shadrach of course i do everyone knows
[17125.75s -> 17139.10s]  shadrach he's a brute and beats children if they make too much noise near his cave um he seems most
[17139.10s -> 17146.87s]  ferocious he hates children he says they're all thieves and villains i have to go now i have to
[17146.87s -> 17155.00s]  go where i'm going back home before they close the gates with a final nod he in the other direction
[17155.00s -> 17161.61s]  across the gates with a final nod he goes in the other direction across the grass it is only later
[17161.61s -> 17181.56s]  you realize he somehow swiped the claw well guess what why did you do that if you i that skull cap
[17181.56s -> 17190.70s]  is so important do we live with it and just not have the skull cap anymore do i have to live with
[17190.70s -> 17195.93s]  some of these things and he took three gold i gotta stop being nice to people and just if it
[17195.93s -> 17202.04s]  says punch in face immediately punch in face if it's just oh a punch person in face done punch
[17202.04s -> 17244.14s]  person in face i'm going this way yeah fuck that i'm going over here i know rewind rewind rewind
[17244.14s -> 17251.56s]  rewinds when he said he was from kare that should have hinted that he was a thief yeah that's true
[17251.56s -> 17257.53s]  i forgot i haven't played it in a while okay you carry on tramping across the endless waste and the
[17257.53s -> 17264.57s]  grass turns to dust as you go the mid-afternoon heat floods the valley the sunlight turns the
[17264.57s -> 17271.18s]  dust of the plane to a bitter yellow as you walk you come across an open area dotted with 20 or 30
[17271.18s -> 17294.52s]  small holes you pull a goblin tooth from your pack and throw it on the ground casting you spell
[17294.52s -> 17299.74s]  across it the tooth erupts into a column of smoke and a moment later a goblin warrior is standing
[17299.74s -> 17306.47s]  in front of you go investigate the holes you direct it to investigate the holes in the ground
[17306.47s -> 17313.66s]  it salutes waddles over to the nearest and peers down a moment later a jet of hot steam vents
[17313.66s -> 17320.28s]  through the earth knocking the goblin high up into the air it howls in pain as it flies up and then
[17320.28s -> 17326.84s]  winks out of existence a moment later the jet also knocks something free from the hole which you
[17326.84s -> 17335.40s]  pick up it is a single polished giant's tooth with a hole drilled at the top part of a pendant perhaps
[17335.40s -> 17342.47s]  you pick it up and put it in your pack a flash of something catches your eye but by the time you
[17342.47s -> 17355.26s]  turn your head whatever it was has gone uh uh well i nice job goblin i ain't looking in the holes
[17355.26s -> 17377.32s]  that not doing that gob for yob got an extra tooth all right onto the bridge the sun is beginning
[17377.32s -> 17382.68s]  to lower the air begins to cool you journey across the open plane approaching a curious
[17382.68s -> 17388.79s]  black stroke that seems to have been drawn across the land as you get closer you see it for what it
[17388.79s -> 17395.85s]  is a gash in the land thousands of fathoms deep the road comes to a stop at the edge of a wide
[17395.85s -> 17401.22s]  fissure in the ground and the ruins of an ancient bridge the wind roars along the crack in the ground
[17401.22s -> 17412.68s]  in front of you like a mockery of a river look down into the crevice you creep to the edge of
[17412.68s -> 17418.04s]  the crack to look down into it it seems to drop for miles besides plunging like a waterfall of rock
[17418.04s -> 17428.60s]  the bottom is lost in mist and the rock walls seem quite sheer i wonder what will happen
[17428.60s -> 17435.80s]  oh look at the bridge there was once a bridge here the road runs up to it and a few stones push out
[17435.80s -> 17440.98s]  over the yawning abyss but as long ago tumbled into ruin and now it does nothing but give you
[17440.98s -> 17446.78s]  an impressive place to look down suddenly you see movement at the edge of the fissure
[17446.78s -> 17452.06s]  some kind of long spike reaches up over the edge bends and hooks into the ground closely followed
[17452.06s -> 17479.78s]  by another whatever it is kill it a nap speed stench talk all languages all right we're going
[17479.78s -> 17489.00s]  to toss we're going to talk all languages it's an earwig grabbing the wig from your pack you pull
[17489.00s -> 17494.01s]  it onto your head and weave your spell but nothing happens this spell works only on intelligent
[17494.01s -> 17498.41s]  creatures and not animals wait wait no no no no no go back i want to talk i want to talk to the
[17498.41s -> 17517.77s]  earwig i actually i really genuinely i want to talk to the earwig okay okay okay all right it's
[17517.77s -> 17529.40s]  not it's uh it's a different spell yap is all talk with animals there we go not languages yap
[17536.06s -> 17540.92s]  grabbing the wig from your pack you pull it onto your head and weave your spell the creatures
[17540.92s -> 17548.09s]  clicking legs and rubbing jaws are suddenly transformed into words soft flesh don't run from
[17548.09s -> 17556.65s]  me come to me i am beautiful as it talks the creature keeps coming it is a long six-legged
[17556.65s -> 17563.51s]  bug with hooked jaws and a deadly looking sting the size of the one you sliced from the back of
[17563.51s -> 17574.71s]  the manticore only days ago so just run run for it you waste no time but turn tail and run but
[17574.71s -> 17581.00s]  the creature whatever it is is out of the crack and the ground and coming for you well i wanted
[17581.00s -> 17590.22s]  to go back here anyway i wanted to go this way anyways you hurry your way down the old road and
[17590.22s -> 17596.39s]  the bug scuttles along behind you running along inside the inside of the fissure to keep up
[17596.39s -> 17601.08s]  it must be able to run much faster than you across the rock as it appears a moment later
[17601.08s -> 17607.43s]  directly before you jaws wide open the creature raises its long sharpened jaws and seems to
[17607.43s -> 17613.48s]  thicken its armor plated hide you steal your courage at the site this is a lynch bug a ferocious
[17613.48s -> 17633.67s]  creature that will be hard to defeat in battle it climbs inside of your ear yeah i could do law
[17633.67s -> 17650.49s]  fireball i don't have access to jig wall i'll do law law is expensive but it usually works really
[17650.49s -> 17661.06s]  well you weave the constellations into a pattern around you reaching out to take control of the
[17661.06s -> 17668.20s]  lynch bug's thoughts its legs lock up and it stiffens it is waiting for your instructions
[17668.20s -> 17680.71s]  walk the bug into the fissure or ride the bug's back ride the bug you bring the bug close to you
[17680.71s -> 17687.37s]  and clamor up onto its back it is uncomfortable but affords a tremendous view of the landscape
[17687.37s -> 17695.69s]  order the bug across the fissure or ride the bug south we gotta go go across right you order the
[17695.69s -> 17702.36s]  bug northwards to the edge of the fissure and ready it to jump but although you control the
[17702.36s -> 17708.42s]  creature's will you cannot override its most basic instincts instead of jumping the fissure
[17708.42s -> 17715.06s]  it leans out over the side and begins to climb down the rock face into the depths of the canyon
[17715.06s -> 17722.25s]  hold on you cling onto the bug's antenna for life as it turns vertical there's no way to get off
[17724.79s -> 17733.59s]  oh god down the canyon side the bug continues it's inexorable climb down the canyon side
[17733.59s -> 17740.14s]  it is approaching a large gray brown mucusy something built onto the side of the rock wall
[17740.14s -> 17747.45s]  it's a lynch bug nest and as you approach you see it is crawling with hundreds more lynch bugs the
[17747.45s -> 17755.88s]  thought occurs to you that these ones will not be under the influence of your spell uh should i hide
[17761.90s -> 17771.61s]  order to climb up or crouch low against the sides go in the hive and hang out that's kind of funny
[17771.61s -> 17778.17s]  all right i'm gonna crouch you hunch low against the lynch bug shell hoping to perhaps go unnoticed
[17778.17s -> 17786.78s]  meanwhile the bug reaches the nest and squirms its way in through a tight sticky entrance way
[17786.78s -> 17794.12s]  inside the nest everything falls into darkness except for the echoing clicks of a hundred
[17794.12s -> 17808.26s]  thousand lynch bugs and they're young this is fucked should i pray to the ape or just wait
[17808.26s -> 17819.13s]  but wait you cling on and wait the bug squirms along a narrow passage almost scraping you off
[17819.13s -> 17830.04s]  its back there's nothing you can do but wait the bug enters a wide chamber presumably burrowed deep
[17830.04s -> 17842.65s]  into the rock itself you hear these sounds you're in a wide chamber chewed out from the rock of the
[17842.65s -> 17850.73s]  canyon wall and the center sprawls the vast corpulent body of the lynch bug queen your spell
[17850.81s -> 17866.41s]  has now entirely worn off uh it's the time for the ape to come and help wait you hold on
[17866.41s -> 17875.99s]  hoping against hope for some means of escape the bug you are riding bows low to its queen
[17875.99s -> 17884.14s]  and one of her majesty's 300 eyes settles on you she reaches out a clawed limb and strokes
[17884.14s -> 17894.70s]  the side of your cheek we have to bow bow to her you bow your head low to the queen's gaze
[17894.70s -> 17900.41s]  but you cannot tell if she understands the gesture the queen raises two of her arms and
[17900.41s -> 17906.97s]  intones a few words a moment later the clicks and rubbing of her front legs transforming
[17907.53s -> 17926.49s]  impossibly into human speech greetings you are the anilander uh i um what if that's bad no
[17928.52s -> 17940.81s]  um i am you reply surprised by this turn of events good my enchantment will not last long
[17942.18s -> 17949.34s]  you stare in disbelief the queen's raised arms make it clear what is happening she has cast a spell
[17949.34s -> 17959.08s]  a variant of the rap spell no doubt um your majesty is most powerful should i cast something
[17959.08s -> 17965.82s]  what can i do if this bug can cast a spell then that must mean you are able to as well
[17965.82s -> 17973.62s]  you raise your arms to the stars only to have them pinned by the lynch bug you rode on i am pleased
[17973.62s -> 17987.08s]  you have come i have expected hold on let's do this i am pleased you have come i expected my drone
[17987.08s -> 18004.63s]  to eat you by accident your drone was sent to get me i am pleased it did not as am i but you are the
[18004.63s -> 18015.86s]  one the serpent slayer of legend serpents what do you mean what do you mean serpents you ask
[18015.86s -> 18024.87s]  wondering at what this creature knows the seven serpents of the archmage from an orifice in my
[18024.87s -> 18033.93s]  underbelly i'm going to pull out a claw and a gob of goo this is monarch oil smeared upon the serpent
[18033.93s -> 18042.22s]  of water that swims in lake il klala and it will shrivel like a burned creature she drops the goo
[18042.22s -> 18053.27s]  into your hands holy shit really uh thank you you nod and place the goo into your pack the queen
[18053.27s -> 18063.38s]  clashes together her antenna which you understand as a nod one more thing do not forget there her
[18063.38s -> 18071.22s]  remaining words are lost into clicks and scrapes and wet squirts as her spell fades no i gotta
[18071.22s -> 18083.94s]  remember do remember what your majesty i can't cast all right i'm gonna i'm gonna bow once more
[18083.94s -> 18089.19s]  you bow your head to the queen the lynch bug who brought you here scoops you up and clamors out of
[18089.19s -> 18102.33s]  the nest that's pretty cool where the fuck are we oh it marks it on the map um i gotta be really
[18102.33s -> 18114.73s]  honest with you i don't think i've ever seen that that's the first time i've ever seen that
[18114.73s -> 18127.72s]  i've never seen that happen that was cool all right out of the out of the fissure the bug clamors
[18127.72s -> 18134.12s]  up over the canyon's edge and drops you into the dirt with a final nod it turns and strides away
[18134.12s -> 18139.24s]  call a thank you you call out a thank you to the bug but it is already gone you look around once
[18139.24s -> 18145.13s]  more a few birds swoop in and wheel in the crevice turning circles that are way below you and yet
[18145.13s -> 18155.56s]  still high up in the air we got earwig friends right that was cool all right um we gotta see i
[18155.56s -> 18171.67s]  i'm gonna jump across this right this makes the most sense to me or uh teleport but i don't have
[18171.67s -> 18182.01s]  the item um create a force field i guess i get hurt floating is definitely it makes the absolute
[18182.01s -> 18189.34s]  most sense look you cast the spell lightening your body weight to the mere fraction of normal
[18189.34s -> 18195.19s]  jump you eye up the width of the gap cautiously it is a long distance made harder to judge by the
[18195.19s -> 18199.83s]  featurelessness of the far side you'll probably be unable to make it at least not without aid
[18199.83s -> 18206.97s]  so taking a short run up you race for the edge of the fissure and hurl yourself out into space
[18206.97s -> 18212.20s]  your feather lightweight means you hardly fall but it also means the speed of your run-up is
[18212.20s -> 18220.02s]  quickly lost you fall gently and calmly for a long long way into the featureless chasm
[18220.02s -> 18225.26s]  then with no warning the spell ends and you speed up nothing else happens for some time
[18225.26s -> 18233.37s]  and then when finally something does occur it is mercifully brief so i wily coyoted off the edge
[18233.37s -> 18251.59s]  come on how far is this chasm all right well i think this gotta be a way to get over there
[18251.59s -> 18257.06s]  i could fix the bridge with the tower there's no way for me to get over there from here
[18259.45s -> 18270.58s]  cause slowness i have an idea i'll cast slowness on myself you cast you cast the enchantment but
[18270.58s -> 18275.14s]  without any other creatures around the only target is yourself you feel no different once the spell
[18275.14s -> 18282.71s]  is taken hold but the clouds overhead seem to double their haste jump across you eye up the
[18282.71s -> 18289.02s]  width you're probably unable to make it without a let's go taking a short slow motion run-up
[18289.10s -> 18296.44s]  you stride for the edge of the fissure and hurl yourself out into space the chasm whisks away
[18296.44s -> 18303.91s]  below you at a comical speed and the wind that batters at you is not enough to slow you down
[18303.91s -> 18311.35s]  a moment later you collide into the ground on the far side in a pile of scratches and scrapes what
[18311.35s -> 18329.61s]  i made it wait the slow motion jump works that's so stupid i was just in slow motion the whole time
[18329.61s -> 18343.26s]  the world moves faster around you okay i did an action movie jump well shit i'm kind of stuck over
[18343.26s -> 18363.53s]  here you slowed your own physics down i lost a lot of health and after crossing the bridge that is
[18363.53s -> 18379.64s]  where we're going to call it so i'm going to ask you the question the question is do you want to
[18379.64s -> 18387.82s]  keep going with this you still want to go through sorcery i'm going to put it in a little i'm going
