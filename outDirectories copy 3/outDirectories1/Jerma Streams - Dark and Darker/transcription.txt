[25.59s -> 48.78s]  What's, uh, what's happening? How you doing? Yeah, supposed to be live tomorrow, but good life today. Felt like it. Hope you're doing well.
[50.74s -> 68.70s]  Got a plan tonight. Uh, I was going to play Dark and Darker Tomorrow, but I saw everybody playing it and I got, I got FOMO and I didn't, I was like, okay, it's out right now. It's only going to be up for like five or six days or something.
[68.70s -> 69.58s]  I was like, I don't want to waste it tomorrow. I want to play it right now. I did play a handful of rounds just to get the controls because there's not really a proper tutorial. I understand how the game works. And boy, oh boy, is this game easy. My goodness. I've won every match. I have a ton of cool stuff. It's actually very simple. It's probably the easiest game I've ever played in regards to difficulty. And by that, I mean, um, it's hard for me to get
[113.39s -> 152.44s]  past the first two skeletons. And if I do that, I usually die in the next room. So yeah, I think it'll be fun. But I was, I was, I was like, what the fuck is going on? What is this game? What is this game? And then I decided to read the developer, um, little manual that's here. And in that manual, it says that, uh, 90% of our internal testers died to the first monster.
[153.28s -> 201.46s]  Now I don't feel so bad. I don't feel so bad now, but that's just the way it is. Yeah. How come you're so zesty? Why is the microphone so close to my face? Hold on. There we go. Uh, yeah. And I know this game is about, I, I join a party. Don't do it alone, but whatever. Maybe we will. Maybe eventually. I don't know. I let me just see if I like it first, right? Let me just see if I like before I like hit up a bunch of streamer friends or YouTubers, whatever, or the people in the community or whatever. What I, let me just make, let me just make sure I like it.
[201.62s -> 255.47s]  Surprise stream. Yes. That was easy. Where's Gunnu? Hey, Gunnu. No, no, no, no, no. People haven't, people didn't potentially watch the VOD last night. I don't want to give any spoilers. All right. So let's go. I'm just going to go. I do have a question. And I know a lot of you, this is my first time playing this. I didn't participate in the alpha first two alphas, whatever they were. So I'm going to have a lot of questions and I would like them to have them answered. If you could please help me.
[255.49s -> 295.16s]  Question number one, this new map, this goblin caves map, put it in the emote only. What? No, I don't do that. I need help. Is this goblin caves map something I should be doing solo? Because when I went to it and I opened it, it looked like a ton of really hard monsters were just walking around. Yeah. Because as of this update, I think it's there's a solo only map. It's only solo. The goblin cave is so hard.
[295.18s -> 335.25s]  Yeah. It's really hard monsters. Yeah. It's solo, but way hard. Okay. All right. Well, let's just, I'm just jumping in. Look, and I, you look, people are going to give me a lot of help. I'm sure there's going to be people that are trickling into this stream that like are going to ask, hey, I'm just like curious. Can, can this guy tie his shoes or is this like a normal thing? And I know I'm, I'm ready to, I'm prepared to look over and see so bad omega low. And I'm going to make sure it doesn't get to me. I'm going to look over. I'm going to see it probably every 10 seconds.
[335.25s -> 379.01s]  I've just, I know it. I, I'm in the mirror. I was, I was doing nice, relaxed breathing. I was going, all right, you can do this. We're going to be good. It's already bad. All right. Are you guys ready? I've got my drink here. I'm ready to play some games. Let's go for it. You'll be doing well. Don't make fun of me too much. I'm new. So, uh, I'm just going to do the regular mode. I made a couple of characters. This is mead one, not to be confused with mead.
[379.01s -> 411.62s]  Three, mead four, mead five, or smush. I have smush one, smush three, smush seven. Well, sorry, smush now. Where's mead two? Yeah, I skipped over two and I skipped over like five. I don't know who to play with.
[411.62s -> 431.15s]  Barbarian seems dangerous. Fighter seems like the thing to start with. I'm going to start with fighter. I'm going to start with, I got a shield. Is this a good stream to fall asleep to? Um,
[431.15s -> 443.32s]  ask that again in 20 minutes after I've screamed for the first time. Probably, hopefully not that loud. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to stay with the fighter. This is just the default class. It's just the fighter.
[443.32s -> 457.34s]  You can use most gear. You can do most things and you have a sword and a shield. I'm just going to go. I don't know why. I must have said hi at some point with the other character to nobody. All right, let's go. Let's go. I'm going.
[457.34s -> 488.19s]  Am I going to get stream sniped? Oh shit. I probably am. I'm going to get, I'm going to get stream sniped. Oh, it's open mic. I turned it off. I made sure to turn voice chat off. Don't worry. I put, I put stream remote on and I turned off voice chat. I don't know if that matters.
[488.19s -> 536.75s]  Okay. Here we go. Both headphones going in. It's time for me to try this game out. All right. It's time for me to try this game out. That was kind of E3, I will say. Okay. I already hear something. Hold on. Should I worry about people hearing my footprints?
[536.75s -> 607.18s]  Pick it up. What is that? Is it loud? It sounds kind of loud. Oh, a gem. Does that mean anything? Is it good? Okay, good. There's a lot. Okay. So for those of you that don't know, this is a PV, PVP, PVPVPE. Okay. I can't make any, I can't like talk. Is that a person? This is, that's a player. Is it a player?
[608.18s -> 635.11s]  What the, what is that? Ow. All right. So I'm dead. All right. So I died. That's, it's a good test run. I'm dead and I lost. It is kind of loud. It's too loud. All right. That's it. That's game number one. I'm trying to think of what I might have done wrong there.
[635.11s -> 706.10s]  I got, I got, there's too many people in that room and I met, I messed up. Is this a VR game? All right. Is the audio, how's the, how is the audio? Is it actually too soft? Like that? I wonder if that's better. Music can stay there. All right. So the whole, what can you, can I, can, what did I do wrong? What did I do? I can't do face cam. I don't have any clothes on. I literally don't have a shirt on. I can't. I'm not doing that. So should I just wait and slowly walk around and open chests and stuff?
[707.10s -> 779.70s]  Only engage one enemy at a time. I mean like this mother fucker right here. All right. Well, there's two enemies now. What? I didn't block it. Excuse me. Why is that not blocking? Hold on. That one doesn't count. Why did it not block? You went right through the fucking shield. It's loud. It's a timed block. Wait, it's timed. So I can't just hold it up. I have to like, oh, boom.
[779.70s -> 842.86s]  Okay. I'm learning. Hey, the developers of the game couldn't even get past the first run. So easy. Easy. I'm not going to uninstall the game. What are you talking about? I'm not going to uninstall it. Yeah. Well, I guess I'm going to uninstall the game. That's enough. I've had enough. Oh my God. That probably hurt. That was my blood coming off of my hand. That was nothing to do with his head. Aim at the, at the attack. I'll figure it out. Okay.
[842.86s -> 933.32s]  No, I'm not uninstalling it. The only way you can get good is if you get good. Nowhere in the get good manual is it uninstall the game after 10 minutes. That's not get good. I thought that hurt me. Ooh, a ring. I'm not going that way. I'll deal. I'll deal with the spiders. One hit. Okay. Look over here. Can I break that? Okay. You can break it. All right. All right. All right. Not bad.
[933.32s -> 1009.24s]  Okay. Not bad. Not bad. Didn't take any damage. I got to move here. Actually, I don't want to go this way. The thing's coming. Look at the mini map. Should I cover the mini map? Is that what streamers do? Cause you know where I am. What is this? Why are you in this room? So is somebody saying it's a physics based block? All right. Give me a fucking diamond. Give me some gems, some jewels. Thank you. All right. How do I get out of here? I want to leave now. I got three gems.
[1009.24s -> 1101.93s]  I'm done. I want to leave. How do I get out? How do I get out of here? I need to find a portal. Where are they? Is there weight in this game? Okay. I got to go over here. I got to wrap around. I can't get this way. Head towards the middle. They only spawn near the end of the round. Okay. And the round is eight and a half minutes left from what I understand. You're looking at that, right? Watch out. I got to go. I got to go. I got to go.
[1101.93s -> 1172.87s]  How do I get through this? Can I open this? I got to go now. Is there a lever? I don't, I don't see one. I don't see one. Is there one on the wall? I don't see. I'm just going to go this way. Oh shit. I'm dead. Or the side of the door. Uh, hold on. I got kind of screwed here. I got screwed. What the fuck is wrong with me? What happened? What? Where the fuck did all these people come from? I got screwed. I got screwed. That's what happened.
[1172.87s -> 1241.99s]  I couldn't leave. And the thing, I got screwed. Is this harder than Elden Ring? Um, I don't know. Maybe it was a stone by one of the doors. I'm getting it though. I'm understanding it. Yeah. The game is meant to be very difficult by design. Well, I kind of, that was kind of a bad spawn. I got trapped behind that wall with the lever and I didn't, it was on the other side. Best to play it in a team. Well, I would like to get to a point where I see another player first. All right, let's go. I get it. This looks like a much better spawn.
[1241.99s -> 1364.92s]  Am I poisoned? I'm already poisoned. Shit. Come on, man. Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. Two movement speed. Those are pretty good. I actually am a little faster. All right. All right. All right. Campfire kit. I know this heals. Somebody shooting. Make sure to close the doors behind you. Yeah, that's true. Shit. What have you done? Why'd you aggro everybody? Oh, what have you done? What have I done? What have you done? I got him. How do I heal? Fuck you. Oh,
[1364.92s -> 1430.41s]  oh, Jesus. You can't get in here. I'm going to heal in here. All right. I feel pretty good about that. All right. So can, can rogues go invisible? What happened? Oh, I'm okay. Oh, it's only like a half heal. All right. I got to kill. I'm happy about that. I got to go loot that body. Your E is a heal. It is. Oh my God. I thought it was like a power up. Where'd that, where'd that guy die?
[1430.41s -> 1563.08s]  Oh my. Oh shit. What is this? An, a sacrificial altar. Oh, okay. I'm fucking, I'm fucking out of here. Like the whole instance aggroed to me. Okay. What was that? How do I throw this? Oh shit. A portal appeared. Did they show up on the mini map or no? The hell? How do I put, how do I equip that? All right. I'm kind of safe here. It's like three.
[1563.08s -> 1670.89s]  My friends, those, they're friends. I ain't going over there. Oh shit. It's three of them. It's three people. It's three people. I killed somebody. Shit. Holy shit. There's an omega chest. Guys. There's an omega chest right here. Oh, I can't, how do I get out of here? I hope I, I need to leave now. I'm safe right here. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. This is so much. I can take everything. Oh my God. Look at all this gear. That's all. This doesn't look good. Does anybody have anything? What a battle that came. Look at this battle that happened here.
[1670.89s -> 1702.83s]  This stuff, it's all just default shit. This guy's going over. Oh, that's like a whole party. That's a whole party. That's an entire party.
[1704.94s -> 1723.96s]  I got nowhere to run. How'd I get out of here? Use your invisibility potion? How do I switch to it? How do I switch to it?
[1723.96s -> 1725.80s]  How do I switch to it? How do I switch to it? How do I switch, how do I switch to it?

[3005.15s -> 3013.68s]  I didn't know you had to sit there and open it like a treasure chest wizard was helping you

[3390.08s -> 3406.08s]  Okay. Yeah, but I don't know in a game like this. You don't expect anybody to be friendly. There's a taunt. That's kind of good
[3406.08s -> 3417.53s]  I feel like I need to use these more often. I'll be fine though. Yeah, PvP is the point of the game. Yeah. Yeah

[4066.44s -> 4069.96s]  because they're spending all this time desperately trying to get over to where I am and
[4070.48s -> 4076.86s]  They they're spending like 15 to 20 minutes sometimes getting precisely to where I am and I just die in the first five minutes
[4076.86s -> 4088.13s]  And they're just like what the fuck maybe that's a deterrent to stream snipers interesting. All right, this is this is a this is a good room

[6667.82s -> 6674.06s]  Just a little much when each person I saw I saw two different people had a an
[6674.74s -> 6678.22s]  Absolute just there was a choo-choo train of enemies running after
[6679.22s -> 6697.84s]  Single person dude. This is laser tag on steroids. That's funny. I was fair and better in the team stuff
[6711.76s -> 6750.22s]  Alright same spot. I need you to test it. That is hit myself with the sword. I'm hitting myself with my own weapon
[6754.80s -> 6805.85s]  I'm already in trouble. There's a player. Alright, give me some stuff. Alright way back. I just got a green ring
[6805.85s -> 6863.83s]  That's gonna be worth like 20 bucks. What was what is that? Oh, I might say that they can't fire eight eight
[6863.83s -> 6897.88s]  Oh shit. Okay, I'm going in. What is that? I got okay. I'm gonna set it. I gotta move. No, I got a bandage
[6897.90s -> 6909.81s]  No, no, no, no, I don't want to swing. Why is this what I'm not pressing any buttons?
[6909.81s -> 6914.63s]  I'm I might literally my hands are in the air guys. I'm not pressing any buttons. Stop swinging
[6914.63s -> 6920.41s]  I'm not pressing any buttons. I probably just looked like a fucking crazy person comes to the campfire
[6920.41s -> 6934.67s]  Look, that's the dumbest thing in the game. There's literally should be removed
[6934.67s -> 7000.83s]  They literally they should take it out of the game tomorrow. You take all this stuff. Ah, you missed this thing on the bottom
[7000.83s -> 7063.40s]  Oh stop. That shit is way harder. I'd rather fight the three players. You can see traps on the map
[7063.58s -> 7091.74s]  Really? I can't believe you're dying to level one goblin enemies. Yeah, pretty rough. All right. There we go
[7091.82s -> 7146.10s]  Look at this already getting started with some fucking wines of olive oil. You holy shit. That's not bad
[7146.20s -> 7149.31s]  Can't use it. But okay. I gotta go down. Oh
[7170.59s -> 7197.61s]  Okay, that's a good start take my time here
[7197.61s -> 7240.97s]  I'm kind of in the middle so I don't really have to go that far that on nice. Oh, yep
[7240.99s -> 7271.70s]  Those better 30 25 now, I'll hold them though. I get this whole area to myself spell book longbow
[7271.70s -> 7293.68s]  You go in the hole. Maybe ooh surge full heel. Oh my goodness. It's a full heel
[7293.72s -> 7334.16s]  Okay, I got no excuse now. Where's the actual circle right now?
[7334.18s -> 7360.82s]  I feel like I'm very far away from it. There's a lot of shit in here. I'm gonna hang out it for a minute
[7360.82s -> 7411.69s]  I think it's pretty quick too. It's a lot of money. Okay, let's go
[7411.69s -> 7454.95s]  Loot so many chests. I gotta turn and run in a second here. Okay time to move
[7454.95s -> 7459.96s]  I got a lot of money to one more chest and I'm gonna go I promise
[7459.96s -> 7530.49s]  Yeah, I think sucks a lot of shit here. Look at all this stuff. No, I want to pick it up

[7670.71s -> 7677.52s]  What's going on with the weather three portals in the same spot, dude?
[7677.52s -> 7696.25s]  I was running around like an asshole when I had all that shit and there was only one there in the middle
[7696.25s -> 7722.60s]  I was it directly in the center. What look at all these there's so many in this spot. Oh
[7726.39s -> 7727.63s]  Come on
[7727.63s -> 7737.38s]  You don't start spawning till late
[7737.38s -> 7767.49s]  You should get near the center early then camp out till you see the prompts about a portal the caves I guess
[7771.58s -> 7779.75s]  We actually might have a friend here. Hold on a second. I
[7787.34s -> 7797.90s]  Want it? I was gonna play with other I'm definitely into it. So I'm down to party in random places. It's all good

[8186.02s -> 8194.52s]  I have nothing on me. I don't have a bunch of jewels or anything. Did you crouch? Did you crouch yet?
[8194.52s -> 8237.29s]  What's this? What the fuck is that? Oh my it's a red spider. No, that is not happening. Uh, uh-oh

[8253.19s -> 8265.62s]  How do I how do I how do I fix this? How do I fix this? I have to run through it
[8265.62s -> 8289.04s]  Bro, where are the freaking portals?
[8330.45s -> 8334.01s]  They gone why is there not one here?
[8334.01s -> 8354.25s]  I thought it would spawn in a circle where I was they were on the floor above me, bro
[8354.37s -> 8373.48s]  With all that verticality, how can you tell where one ever is?
[8373.66s -> 8388.18s]  They're all first-come first-serve. They always seem to spawn on the top floor
[8388.18s -> 8416.46s]  Is that is that for real or is that just so they're always on the top floor? I made it up
[8416.46s -> 8459.41s]  Oh, I'm just a day win motherfucker. Not that easy. There we go. All right, we're back in it now
[8459.41s -> 8485.52s]  We're back in it. You just killed your friend

[8603.34s -> 8622.73s]  Sorry, I read that from chat. I had to do it. What you there's no way you hit me with that
[8623.25s -> 8649.86s]  Get out of town. I'm in so much trouble. No, no, no, I'm in so much trouble. There's a fucking plate right there
[8649.86s -> 8659.80s]  What's going on? Ah, what? Where are they?
[8667.98s -> 8675.16s]  This is so hard, I got decapitated
[8677.14s -> 8684.57s]  God damn it. I got a but I got I gotta buy something. I have to buy something. I'm buying
[8684.95s -> 8702.87s]  I'm gonna lose all my money buying buying this longsword. No, I'm not 34. I'm buying this
[8702.87s -> 8716.81s]  I gotta give myself a chance, right?
[8717.21s -> 8743.21s]  47 this one's 13 the believers are filing for bankruptcy
[8743.49s -> 8780.68s]  At least I have some armor and more than 20 damage. We're good. Everything's good. Does he make it out alive?
[8782.92s -> 8796.43s]  2.1 to 9 point Wow. Well if I win I make a lot of you really really rich with channel points

[8825.00s -> 8891.80s]  I was stuck. It was so loud. Patch it. What is this? What did that do? Secret? Stop it. Stop!
[8893.15s -> 8909.64s]  Throw a torch at it. Yes. Ooh
[8916.09s -> 8926.35s]  A spear. I don't know how to use this. Is it 34 versus 39? I don't know
[8926.61s -> 8943.97s]  It's where I got a lot of reach though. Okay. So the last one is a swing down
[8944.05s -> 8960.24s]  Looks like it has a block at least or the parry at least. Okay, cool. All right, let's go. What do I?
[8960.88s -> 9043.40s]  Why this is a maze but that was a player that's shit away from me. Oh
[9043.92s -> 9139.22s]  Portal up. Holy shit you oh my god. How'd tell me how to tell how can you tell?

[9179.05s -> 9185.82s]  There was one what my my indicator was on top of it my little indicator
[9185.82s -> 9192.04s]  It's so teeny little tiny my characters arrow indicator was covering it
[9192.24s -> 9220.10s]  You can crouch crouch. I didn't know you could avoid it by crouching this
[9220.62s -> 9222.62s]  How was I supposed to know that?
[9222.70s -> 9229.69s]  It reminds me of
[9229.69s -> 9233.87s]  Darkest dungeon when some you just walk in and all of a sudden it's just like yeah
[9233.87s -> 9262.21s]  Like the thing just fucking the trap on the ground just attacks you I'm fucking angry now
[9262.33s -> 9269.51s]  You I know, you know, I was that me or you well, I thought that was that I thought there's a mage
[9269.53s -> 9272.57s]  I thought that was a player. This is not a player

[9369.41s -> 9389.58s]  Remember that was a cat. Everybody loves Otto. You're dying too fast for mods to be able to put up new poles
[9390.26s -> 9394.66s]  Dude, I'm sorry. What am I supposed to do?
[9396.10s -> 9414.76s]  back back
[9414.76s -> 9458.30s]  Good I get poisoned. Oh, come on. That's a big deal. That's one knowledge. I'm so much smarter with this on look
[9458.30s -> 9497.20s]  Oh, I want to mine this so bad. That's where you get the crystals. They're more than one. It was two burning eggs
[9497.42s -> 9556.92s]  Agility and action speed nice. Okay, not bad. Can't put any of that on try to dodge it a lot of boots down here
[9561.17s -> 9571.67s]  18 pretty these things this is all crap. I don't even this is not even worth selling. Yeah wizard shoes

[9681.45s -> 9696.66s]  It doesn't care. It doesn't care. It doesn't care. He doesn't care. Oh my god. I had 50% HP
[9702.39s -> 9731.18s]  Crouch and people will be friends that first was a rabbit animal just like I whatever I had didn't have very much help
[9731.18s -> 9736.19s]  I had like what half health I tried to do I pressed control too many times
[9736.19s -> 9745.29s]  I sticky keyed myself as somebody that was just easy to kill control control control control
[9745.91s -> 9772.22s]  Kill that one. Oh nice. I'm so addicted to this game, but I can't win
[9773.90s -> 9788.49s]  Frustrating get your ass away from me
[9789.86s -> 9792.25s]  Just restart
[9792.25s -> 9811.56s]  Fucking pissed trying to the class. I want I need to get it at least one more. I need to get out one more time
[9811.56s -> 9819.16s]  I'm not turning the stream off unless I survive again. I don't care if I'm here for ten straight days
[9819.30s -> 9825.88s]  I'm not turning the stream off until I get out again. I don't care if it takes a hundred years
[9825.88s -> 9840.48s]  I don't care if I turn to dust in this chair. Okay, we're good. This is not a bad place to spawn
[9859.32s -> 9875.34s]  Explosion bottle. Why am I not doing the strategy? This is impossible. I'm never gonna do it. Everybody accepted right now
[9875.38s -> 9881.84s]  It's never happening. I will never do it. It's just I mean they pack it up. This is not happening
[9881.84s -> 9885.43s]  It's never gonna happen. I escaped last time I said that
[9885.97s -> 9909.15s]  Look at how much stuff is on that fucking goddamn cupboard. Oh hell
[9911.90s -> 9918.20s]  That hurt a lot
[9918.20s -> 9965.99s]  You didn't hit me you swung around my body you look at all this stuff. Oh my god. It's so many things
[9965.99s -> 9974.25s]  I'm taking oh my god. That was a blue. I'm taking the I'm taking the whole entire antiques roadshow with me
[9974.25s -> 9978.86s]  I have to get out of here now. I'm just gonna I'm gonna run to the middle. I'm gonna hide
[9978.86s -> 10048.64s]  I'm literally gonna hide in a corner. What the fuck? Why do I hear so many noises? What is that? Oh, I'm so fucking jumpy
[10048.78s -> 10073.78s]  Hey, hey, hey, they back fuck you
[10077.31s -> 10100.24s]  You piece of shit, no, I wasn't ready I wasn't ready I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. He scared the fuck out of me
[10101.40s -> 10118.38s]  Oh my god, it's just like he appeared behind me and he my heart started to go fuck
[10118.38s -> 10126.94s]  I had a full heel how but I am I gonna be like done
[10127.08s -> 10144.92s]  How long does it take to heal every other heel in the game besides the health potions?
[10144.92s -> 10147.46s]  Is it like an instant heal? I'm thinking like it's a bandage
[10147.50s -> 10155.00s]  It probably takes a long time and he's doing this like or back forward for back for back for back stab forward back for back
[10155.36s -> 10170.10s]  He swings so much faster than me. It takes a good 30 seconds to heal with the surgical kits
[10170.10s -> 10217.10s]  Yeah, was that a poison dagger too? I feel like it was it was poisoned. Oh, there's three things here
[10217.10s -> 10226.70s]  Never mind. You'll do an attack chain
[10226.78s -> 10231.04s]  Yeah, but I feel like though it's me holding down the attack button
[10231.04s -> 10243.78s]  He'll stab me four times and I'm dead like I have to block so much shit in here
[10244.14s -> 10280.37s]  Alright, why does out played by the AI the AI stopped moving and just sat there looking at me regardless of the loss rate
[10280.49s -> 10289.11s]  Well, I mean it's the first day I've ever played it. Give me give me a break. I've never played this before
[10289.11s -> 10296.54s]  This is the first time I've ever played a video game as I'm an actor. I'm an actor. I don't play video games
[10296.54s -> 10361.58s]  I'm an actor stop. All right, let's do it. I'll change classes after this. I'll try the I'll try the Ranger Ranger rules
[10361.60s -> 10370.24s]  Did I get it? I did. Okay Ranger is snooze
[10370.24s -> 10394.12s]  Um, I would want to try it at least once Rangers not great solo
[10394.12s -> 10412.97s]  I feel like this is a great solo class to be wrong. Is that incorrect rogue is wizard is crazy
[10413.37s -> 10453.25s]  Solo really you like spaghetti. This is my only question. Yeah, I love spaghetti. I'll be taking that one. This looks like a trap
[10453.25s -> 10465.56s]  I'm wait. It's not on the mini map. It's not on the mini map. Where is it on the mini map?
[10465.60s -> 10488.84s]  It's not on the mini map. It's not on the mini map. I think I'm all right
[10488.94s -> 10507.34s]  I'm

[10513.38s -> 10520.40s]  I'm not gonna fight you. Look see I haven't swung at you. I'm protecting you. I'm helping. Let's go. Let's get out of here
[10520.50s -> 10538.27s]  Yes, I feel like he's gonna hit me. Well, I keep like I don't know
[10538.27s -> 10547.76s]  I feel like he's gonna hurt me. We should probably be Wow. Okay, cool. All right, we need if we gotta find a portal
[10547.76s -> 10588.75s]  We gotta get out of here. It's bugleberry. Should we try to kill the boss? What is going on here? Hey, stop hitting me
[10588.75s -> 10596.49s]  Why is he hitting me? Why is he hitting me? Wait, who's wait? What was a different person? It was a different guy
[10596.97s -> 10608.20s]  What do you mean? That's a different guy. It looked exactly the same. It was the same person. That was a different guy
[10608.52s -> 10614.25s]  They had the same exact clothes on it was the same person
[10619.91s -> 10629.00s]  All the classes look the same, but yeah, but they had the same robe on they had the same staff
[10629.32s -> 10637.24s]  No, they didn't he had like a club. I don't whatever I he was behind me. I turn I turn around he's right there
[10637.30s -> 10650.58s]  I'm thinking that's my buddy with the fucking magical shit. Okay, maybe it was a trap. Maybe he lured you into it
[10657.18s -> 10669.06s]  Damn it. I need to I spent all my money. I have like five gold. Yeah, I I kind of just I see a
[10669.90s -> 10675.74s]  Bugleberry walking towards me. I'm like, oh, that's bugleberry because he was just he was right there a second ago
[10675.74s -> 10679.94s]  And then I get hit in the head with a fucking mace. It's like wait, what's happening?
[10680.74s -> 10685.11s]  Why is everything going dark my head hurts?
[10697.14s -> 10719.67s]  So bad there's a diamond

[10853.83s -> 10858.45s]  See, it's not just me. Don't make you make fun of me. It's not just me. It's not just me
[10858.45s -> 10872.15s]  Everybody gets hit by that shit. He's dead
[10882.37s -> 10884.37s]  Right now
[10886.95s -> 10891.19s]  I can't do this right now. What happened? I feel so bad
[10892.19s -> 10893.59s]  Oh
[10893.59s -> 10929.38s]  He's got like fucking jewels on him though. I give me a portal get me out of here already. I got I have like stuff
[10929.38s -> 10942.94s]  I'm okay. I'm just I'm gonna find a portal. I'm just going to the middle. This is gonna be awful
[10942.94s -> 10945.94s]  Look, we're in this room this huge
[10945.94s -> 10956.68s]  Look at all this verticality all this bullshit camp in the middle until the circle closes in in the portal spawn
[10956.72s -> 10958.96s]  That's that's kind of the goal right now
[10958.96s -> 11004.66s]  I'm just gonna sit right here and no one's even gonna fucking see me. I need to go over here
[11004.66s -> 11006.52s]  Okay, I'm going in here and I'm gonna hang out in this one
[11006.52s -> 11015.59s]  This is where I'm gonna just sit turn all the turk close every door and turn all the torches off
[11015.81s -> 11059.45s]  One person has escaped one person escape portals appeared you fucking piece of shit. I would die. Yeah, that's how he died
[11059.75s -> 11079.88s]  Where is it? Come on. Is it above me or something? I'm gonna go up. Oh, I can't I can't do it
[11079.88s -> 11083.56s]  I can't do it. I can't do it. I'm gonna die if I go up
[11083.74s -> 11106.92s]  I don't have any more healing potions you have to this game is so fucking hard
[11107.02s -> 11112.84s]  the fact that you have to find one of these portals and it could be anywhere and like
[11114.58s -> 11131.96s]  Go so that so there was one portal somewhere in that area
[11132.76s -> 11146.55s]  Somewhere I mean I was just down I went up but the thing is already there
[11146.61s -> 11160.25s]  If you waited another portable to spawn you were the last person is there any way I can see that or is it?
[11160.25s -> 11165.94s]  I just keep track of the kill feed. How would I know? I'm the last person does it tell you?
[11172.39s -> 11179.37s]  I kind of just want to die so I can just start the maps. Oh, I'm wearing them out
[11179.37s -> 11186.11s]  I see the timer does it show player count? I'm done. I'm dead
[11186.11s -> 11198.86s]  I'm just trying to see like where is there an indicator? It's on top now that one doesn't count
[11198.90s -> 11210.19s]  So let me I got a question
[11210.19s -> 11216.64s]  So even if everybody is dead you're dead too if you don't go in one of the random portals
[11217.30s -> 11258.03s]  Everybody's dead. You still have to leave the same fortnight focus on just finding a portal, you know
[11258.17s -> 11259.37s]  Yeah, I'm not gonna find one till late game
[11259.37s -> 11267.45s]  So is it a certain minute wise or a certain how big the circle is the one the one thing?
[11267.45s -> 11270.45s]  I'm getting confused at is so I was the last person left there
[11270.53s -> 11276.04s]  How come the oranges portals everywhere in that because remember like three or four games ago?
[11276.36s -> 11292.60s]  There were like five portals in the middle at the end. It's just based on time. It was map size
[11294.30s -> 11303.90s]  In the goblin caves only three portals open up every time only three people could leave my god
[11303.90s -> 11334.99s]  That sucks. It's based on how many players are there is this well somebody's walking not that person by the way
[11334.99s -> 11373.72s]  I heard something. No, I'm telling you. It's not this person. Okay. I got a pretty good helmet ten goddamn minutes
[11373.72s -> 11424.17s]  I get it all I'm kind of in the middle already. So now just go up
[11429.31s -> 11442.47s]  Where is up? Somebody was here. There's something is anything on the on the mini map look like a staircase
[11442.47s -> 11447.69s]  Like what does the staircase look like on the mini map? I don't think it looks like anything. Okay, I'm up now
[11447.71s -> 11477.49s]  I always make a habit of crouching in hallways not a bad idea nice alright besides my weapon. I've got I'm alright
[11477.49s -> 11503.86s]  I've got some pretty good stuff. Why am I going down? Oh, okay? Never mind after this. I'm just going for survival
[11503.86s -> 11526.40s]  This is a huge chest come on. Give me something give me something. Just let me hide. It's alright 49 pretty good
[11527.89s -> 11529.65s]  23 33
[11529.65s -> 11541.07s]  Get rid of that crap get rid of this bow to fuck this thing get rid of this tunic. Okay, all right all right
[11541.09s -> 11544.25s]  It's time to escape with the jewels and the gems. Oh
[11556.89s -> 11612.31s]  No, okay a portal is out. There's a magical sword in there. Can it jump over? Oh?
[11616.34s -> 11632.54s]  Goff I want whatever that is. Oh
[11644.85s -> 11653.10s]  That's pretty good. Oh, I'm so bad at inventory management
[11653.82s -> 11722.08s]  We friends if you careful be careful. Whoa, that's dangerous up there. I don't get through this
[11722.36s -> 11769.49s]  Why can't I get through that equip the sword? I can't on I need a portal look for the portal
[11769.55s -> 11788.88s]  That's what I'm doing. I'm telling you. I'm looking for one right now. Is that one right there might be get me out of here
[11788.88s -> 11791.91s]  Get me out of here. Get me out of here. Get me out of here. Get me out of here
[11791.91s -> 11798.41s]  Get me out of here believers. We made it second time tonight
[11798.41s -> 11809.92s]  Oh, that's so stressful needing to go find one of these fucking things
[11809.96s -> 11818.53s]  It's so stressful because you just don't know where it is and there's so many people that are trying to kill you
[11818.53s -> 11824.72s]  Okay, I did get some decent stuff. I should be able to sell some of that
[11824.76s -> 11837.72s]  I'm gonna put sunglasses on so many emotes. Yeah, you earned it you earned it
[11837.72s -> 11857.33s]  Did a fun game it is it's very addicting. It's very very hard though. It's a game where one
[11857.93s -> 11867.82s]  Single mistake will just delete all the stuff you have and I am very prone to mistakes
[11867.94s -> 11871.45s]  So take that as you will
[11871.45s -> 11885.74s]  Yeah, I was gonna maybe party up with some people but I wanted to make sure I actually liked it first
[11886.22s -> 11891.66s]  rather than get into a game with two or three people and it's like I actually really don't really like it and
[11893.12s -> 11921.08s]  20 minutes into the game be like, well, sorry guys, it's not for me and leave I think I can just exit right?
[11921.12s -> 11935.18s]  It's not gonna hurt me. Oh my god. All right. Look at all this. I got a big battle axe
[11939.80s -> 11956.60s]  Okay, but I haven't clicked on a merchant in four hours or whatever. It's been nice nice Jesus
[11963.04s -> 11980.45s]  76 bucks actually have money now. So the real question is is it worth me taking that perk to use this?
[11980.63s -> 12006.89s]  No, so I should just sell it shield is better. Yeah, uh, I'm gonna hold on to these. All right
[12006.89s -> 12015.10s]  I got 94 bucks. I get rid of this thing
[12018.17s -> 12037.04s]  3323, okay, so we're gonna be conservative Andy if I have a decent one
[12037.04s -> 12039.24s]  I'm not gonna I'm gonna take the worst one
[12039.40s -> 12046.70s]  we're gonna be conservative Andy here and I'm gonna take all my money in my inventory and
[12049.91s -> 12054.82s]  Just cuz I really want to like flash my wealth around you know, I mean
[12055.00s -> 12072.60s]  Yeah, I feel like that would be like I like somebody's little brother if you killed somebody in the head like a hundred gold
[12072.60s -> 12086.22s]  On or something if they go you just don't you don't understand what's happening right now. It's gotta be nice
[12086.22s -> 12103.84s]  I refuse to have a stash that doesn't look perfect. Okay now I might take some of this shit off depends
[12103.84s -> 12117.19s]  All right weapons see those blue letters and it just makes me sad. Uh
[12128.86s -> 12131.68s]  22 I could buy a

[12192.61s -> 12202.65s]  NHP 15 HP this just way worse. Hold on three of these versus three of these that's an extra 15 health
[12203.97s -> 12222.69s]  45 gold 15 HP over 20 seconds
[12225.28s -> 12227.04s]  15 HP over 20 seconds
[12227.04s -> 12239.47s]  I feel like the bandage is just better but you can drink that and move around this one's cheap six now

[12751.81s -> 12760.74s]  He's literally probably in voice chat right now with two other people that you imagine looking at this guy
[12760.88s -> 12797.04s]  You look at what I got you're coming for me the portal. Oh, I can't use that
[12797.66s -> 12812.23s]  Somebody said hey, dude, this dude's gear is ass. Let's ignore him
[12812.29s -> 12826.19s]  Hey, this dude's gear is ass. Don't worry. No, no, no guys. Everything's gonna be fine. I've been watching this dude stream
[12827.12s -> 12832.48s]  He's literally only escaped twice and he's been playing for four hours. I mean, he's probably gonna die
[12832.48s -> 12836.90s]  Anyways, I kind of feel bad killing him. He's like one of these shitty streamers that like does not have play
[12836.90s -> 12847.86s]  I feel kind of bad. He's lighting something on his hand
[12859.72s -> 12895.17s]  Everybody has you have friends. Don't you I'm gonna go the other way. There's portals everywhere now where I'm sorry
[12895.19s -> 12902.03s]  That fucking scared the shit out of me. I thought they were behind me. I really thought they were behind me
[12902.07s -> 12948.92s]  There's so many portals. How have I not run into one? How have I not run into one actually hit me?
[12948.92s -> 12996.80s]  I need my fucking torch. Oh, what's that sound sound? I heard when I heard it. Hey, hey, hey

[13069.12s -> 13077.42s]  All right for one second. I thought this was a three-part story like something
[13077.42s -> 13080.74s]  This is like a cards on this character like he was eating something
[13080.74s -> 13086.42s]  He ate it and it was gross and it hurt him or something. It looks like oh like I'm testing this and it's like
[13086.42s -> 13095.00s]  Ah, I thought it was like the read for some reason for one second
[13095.00s -> 13141.64s]  I was like, oh, he's like poisoned. He ate something story in 3x not bad. Nice. All right. What do you do with silver?

[13170.88s -> 13184.43s]  That's pretty good. Nice 20 more bucks. Um, I'll keep the bear trap now. I have a really important question
[13184.43s -> 13197.12s]  Do I buy this should I do it? It's gonna be a blue weapon
[13197.12s -> 13204.02s]  I'm gonna lose it all of my money, but it'll be worth it cuz I'll have a blue in my inventory
[13204.04s -> 13212.32s]  I'm not gonna equip it. I'm not equipping this. I just want to make sure I have a blue
[13212.32s -> 13217.81s]  So if somebody comes to this stream and they see me at stash they go, all right, he's got a blue
[13217.81s -> 13221.32s]  He's fucking all right. He knows that he's done. He's got a blue up there
[13221.32s -> 13235.46s]  I was gonna I was literally just gonna leave the stream, but he's all right spend on utility so you can survive
[13235.78s -> 13247.82s]  Do I sell this to him not interested in buying what it's a way again. Explain to me
[13247.82s -> 13261.64s]  What it do with silver sell to the treasurer?
[13262.00s -> 13279.54s]  Golden golden silver is my language by the one. Oh, wait a minute. Oh
[13279.54s -> 13287.40s]  One is free five is 15
[13287.40s -> 13300.10s]  Is it my getting scammed or is this just the exchange rate by a coin purse notice? It's just always three to one
[13300.10s -> 13314.70s]  Okay. All right. This is really good much more money now
[13317.12s -> 13359.06s]  120 bucks I can't even use this I should just sell it. I actually can't use it. Let's go again

[13409.45s -> 13418.16s]  Is it true that you spent a hundred dollars on the family guy mobile game? What year is it right now?
[13419.00s -> 13434.69s]  Asking that why are you asking that? Why are you asking me this? Do you want me to answer the question? Yes back in
[13436.48s -> 13440.32s]  2013 or 2014 I may have spent
[13441.44s -> 13448.92s]  $75 on the family guy the quest for stuff mobile game. I don't know. I just did it

[13484.07s -> 13497.42s]  It was like dopamine or something. I don't know. It was an iPad toilet game
[13510.78s -> 13514.42s]  This is like this is like nine years ago, by the way
[13514.64s -> 13533.17s]  I can't believe you spent $75 for toilet entertainment. Well, hold on
[13533.33s -> 13541.43s]  It was like it was like five dollars at a time and then after I got to like near a hundred
[13541.43s -> 13544.18s]  I was like, all right, I'm done
[13545.02s -> 13547.40s]  And I uninstalled it
[13547.40s -> 13553.92s]  It just I uninstalled it five. Yeah, it was I did five dollars
[13554.52s -> 13573.32s]  Sometimes it's $75. So you wasted money. Yeah, I mean remember that's so much

[13718.06s -> 13726.00s]  I don't know that was not. Oh, what a that doesn't sound like a sound investment to me. Hmm
[13726.00s -> 13728.04s]  I think that's on the level of family guy
[13729.00s -> 13751.76s]  Mobile game purchases, don't you think? All right, we're going for a real one this time
[13751.76s -> 13771.41s]  Yeah, I I know how much people spend on mobile games
[13771.51s -> 13789.40s]  Do I don't think I want to take everything like it's always a mistake to do that, but we got it

[13880.19s -> 13892.52s]  I don't really spend that much money really don't okay. I think I'm ready to go
[13892.68s -> 13908.70s]  I'm gonna take some of the good shit. Let me do my perks kind of like that
[13908.70s -> 13920.18s]  I've spent over two hundred dollars on Pokemon cards
[13920.22s -> 13931.62s]  Yeah, I I mean that some of the mobile game stuff is just clicking on a house to collect coins
[13932.00s -> 13950.17s]  So that's a little different. I'm going in I split I spent over three hundred dollars on planetside to cosmetics. Yeah, whatever

[14020.67s -> 14047.42s]  I gotta get everything and run away. I can't believe you spent
[14048.70s -> 14051.54s]  150 thousand dollars on the family guy
[14052.14s -> 14060.98s]  Mobile game you all right. What do you do? Are you doing that? He's everything. Okay. Hey, I told you that I knew it
[14070.74s -> 14080.29s]  You play with a party where you get jumped by three people
[14080.31s -> 14089.72s]  Well, you play solo and you fight the fucking goblin horde and lose everything's gone
[14089.72s -> 14121.28s]  At least I have I still have money you didn't use II. I kind of was like not even any time
[14121.28s -> 14124.36s]  I think I would have died well before the hill over time happened
[14124.60s -> 14134.19s]  That rogue just got right up my face and was just like bap bap bap bap bap bap
[14134.19s -> 14136.25s]  How do you how do I how do I what do I do about that?
[14136.25s -> 14139.58s]  I feel like I feel like I couldn't do anything about that
[14139.70s -> 14144.20s]  He was just like right in my character's character model just going step step step step step step dad dad dad
[14144.20s -> 14148.28s]  What do you do hit him back?
[14148.74s -> 14153.87s]  All right, just run just kill
[14154.47s -> 14188.56s]  Hit a fucking mage with him. Did I cut my finger cooking any tips?
[14189.32s -> 14194.80s]  Go to the doctor. How bad is it? It's bad. Go to the doctor get stitches or whatever
[14232.30s -> 14252.13s]  Elton if there's gonna I'm telling you there's gonna be some Eve online shit with this game when it eventually is done and everything
[14252.13s -> 14256.28s]  It's already and everything that comes out. They're gonna be people decked out in all
[14256.92s -> 14262.06s]  Legendary fucking uniques and they're gonna lose and it's gonna be an Eve online moment
[14266.48s -> 14272.00s]  There's gonna be one point where you're gonna get all decked out. You're gonna go into a lobby. You're gonna lose everything
[14272.40s -> 14274.76s]  It's gonna be so sad
[14275.28s -> 14279.24s]  I'm actually kind of happy that I'm not really doing that
[14279.24s -> 14281.24s]  Well, and I'm not just keeping that many things
[14281.56s -> 14287.93s]  Because I'm gonna get really attached to like a blue or purple and I'm going to literally stare at the wall for an hour
[14288.25s -> 14300.76s]  If I were to lose it, there's a high roller mode for that. Yeah, the hundred goal to go in
[14301.62s -> 14307.79s]  Sucks I would okay. I would definitely watch people do that. That's way too scary for me
[14307.79s -> 14328.64s]  I'm just gonna pretend like I don't see this person. He's trying to get my attention so bad
[14328.64s -> 14340.25s]  I watch this watch this, but I'm doing this for the joke. I don't care. He's probably like this kid sucks
[14341.73s -> 14358.29s]  Like I guess I just saw him right like wait. Oh, are they watching the stream?
[14359.49s -> 14401.39s]  Thank you. I appreciate it. I'll drop the spiders working together
[14401.41s -> 14424.65s]  Hey, do you mind if I get all the jewels? Hey, thanks. Hey, do you mind if I get all the jewels? You know this guy?
[14439.93s -> 14445.32s]  I'm just kidding. You can have it. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Have it you can take it
[14445.32s -> 14450.85s]  You can have it. You can have it. You can have it. You can have it. How do I drop it, dude?
[14450.85s -> 14457.79s]  I used to play Diablo 2. I don't fuck around. How do I do? How do I get have give back just drink?
[14457.79s -> 14513.70s]  I just drag it out. What's he doing? All right. Well, I'm taking this wrong with me
[14513.70s -> 14547.80s]  Oh, I find our way out of here. I think this is a different person. All right, let's go loot this shit
[14547.90s -> 14586.42s]  We're definitely gonna get a portal. Oh, you're mining. Nice. Oh, it's friend, right guys
[14586.42s -> 14589.02s]  It can be hard to tell all right portals here portals here
[14589.02s -> 14604.78s]  I'm gonna go up right up portals are up portals are up portals up right you need to get out get out get out
[14604.78s -> 14624.64s]  I don't know where like where's a portal down down. I don't see anything like wait
[14624.64s -> 14643.34s]  Wait, do you actually mean that like I actually can't see it. Where is it? I think we're in trouble. What do we do?
[14643.46s -> 14656.03s]  What do we do stone ramp? Well, these guys don't know where to go either. I just heard something. I heard it
[14656.13s -> 14666.24s]  Where is it? Where is it? I dude everything has fucking collision. I I don't know where to go
[14666.24s -> 14683.15s]  I just heard something up the ramp. I I'm gonna die. I think I'm alright. Hold on. You mean like up here, dude
[14683.15s -> 14697.43s]  I like this mode. Where the fuck are they? Why did I wait so long?
[14697.87s -> 14717.08s]  Dude, this this level is like seven thousand feet tall. Well, okay, I got trapped
[14717.08s -> 14725.87s]  If you're outside the circle for more than like ten seconds, you're just dead. I thought I thought they were alright
[14725.93s -> 14731.91s]  So apparently I have this incorrect they do not spawn directly in the middle
[14731.91s -> 14736.87s]  I thought that it was like a ton of them like two three of them at the end will spawn right in the middle right in
[14736.87s -> 14746.01s]  The middle of the circle right in the middle. That's not what happens. Never it's just RNG
[14746.09s -> 14759.18s]  There's so many up and down in this level. How do you reliably know where they are?
[14759.54s -> 14768.83s]  The regular mode is almost it's pretty much one level
[14769.09s -> 14772.39s]  It's not like fucking a ten-story hotel
[14773.11s -> 14832.37s]  Hold everything the awful start. I might just die and restart and poisoned just kill me
[14833.44s -> 14862.01s]  This room is like a fucking million people in it. I was doing fine
[14862.01s -> 14872.21s]  I just got somebody said I got so salty I uninstalled laughing my ass off kind of par for the course
[14872.21s -> 14884.46s]  I think don't you think with this game? He was laughing his ass off. I
[14902.57s -> 14909.04s]  Got so salty uninstalled
[14909.74s -> 14911.34s]  I
[14911.34s -> 14961.89s]  Thought I could kill him in three hits in the head. It's too magic
[14976.08s -> 15001.54s]  He's already damaged boys. Let's go. Come on. Oh, you're gonna make my confidence go to zero or mage. Ooh
[15010.71s -> 15048.34s]  Not a hurt. This is not a horrendous start somebody here. Oh
[15051.10s -> 15105.52s]  Skeleton. Oh fuck German. Just go play slots
[15106.57s -> 15114.96s]  What
[15116.56s -> 15128.99s]  This is the one this is the one hey, I have made character progress I have like a hundred bucks
[15129.27s -> 15136.54s]  Well, I mean I'll have 25 at the end of this after I you know
[15136.54s -> 15159.62s]  I a little bit of family guy gold I would have walked into that trap
[15159.62s -> 15192.79s]  Oh, I've completely forgot to play one of the other classes my bed
[15192.79s -> 15231.50s]  I'll do after this a lot of money the penguin walking you can play this with some friends at a later date
[15233.17s -> 15243.97s]  Probably I'm very I'm addicted to it. I'm addicted to it. Even though I can't do it. Oh
[15278.23s -> 15287.20s]  My god, that guy threw a fucking bomb at me. What are you gonna do now? What are you gonna do now wizard?
[15304.98s -> 15329.40s]  You're dude your nose got cut off such a shitty thing to be in what the fuck you hit me right in the fucking eyes
[15329.94s -> 15332.18s]  He hit me right in the eyes
[15334.32s -> 15381.14s]  Is there a hole in the shield fuck was that sound that was a mistake wasn't it? Oh, no, it's these two
[15391.73s -> 15423.76s]  Powered shield on new class new class. Hold on one more try and I'll switch. Please. I'm losing everything
[15424.12s -> 15431.23s]  Hey, I gotta tell you this is a casino tip or if we're here
[15431.23s -> 15437.68s]  If you're at the casino and you're at the roulette table, and it's red hundred times in a row
[15437.68s -> 15443.90s]  Just bet with the trend you're gonna be like, it's gonna be blitz gonna be black this time
[15444.02s -> 15454.22s]  No, it'll be black this time. No, I think you should I think you should bet with the trend at this point
[15454.36s -> 15461.53s]  That's a fallacy. Of course it is. Oh
[15463.21s -> 15490.39s]  Gambling is just a fallacy. You missed one again. He hit me right in the fucking hair
[15494.50s -> 15520.36s]  No, I'm not fighting this room. Well, this is a lot of stuff. I didn't see I can pull them individually might be alright
[15520.42s -> 15522.31s]  That
[15522.31s -> 15526.96s]  Get you have wall hacks like how would you even have?
[15527.80s -> 15612.01s]  There are three more skeletons in here focusing you're dressed like your character
[15612.01s -> 15637.00s]  I am NOT so there's a pretty decent amount of money. Okay, let me just loot bro. That garb is whack
[15637.00s -> 15659.98s]  Uh, I've been here to this to you're to all this now find a portal and leave
[15659.98s -> 15697.80s]  Um, I don't think they're even spawned in yet clean this up. There it is
[15697.84s -> 15730.60s]  I'm going mess somebody up with that. This is it's such an interesting PvP
[15730.78s -> 15796.19s]  PvP PvP. Okay, decent shield. I'm too junk junk. Alright, there's a portal you alone. You're not alone
[15796.19s -> 15817.04s]  Goodbye. I hope nobody saw me. Oh fuck. Oh my god. Fuck off. Wait, are we fighting?
[15821.57s -> 15824.21s]  I thought they were being non hostile
[15824.81s -> 15839.64s]  They were kind of standing around for a second
[15839.64s -> 15842.50s]  It was a full three or four seconds and I was like, wait a minute
[15842.50s -> 15851.56s]  I I didn't hope they were like stream friends or you know what I mean? I didn't alright
[15852.06s -> 15865.61s]  Let me ask the believer something I can't fight three people. Are we fighting? I know I was just whatever
[15865.61s -> 15876.61s]  I went into this room. I thought I turned the light off. They all just barreled into the room
[15876.61s -> 15880.51s]  I could have probably thrown down. I know I was just stuck
[15880.51s -> 15888.02s]  It was over the mage is just enchanting fire sword on the barbarian and you got a
[15889.06s -> 15890.34s]  monk
[15890.34s -> 15893.08s]  Doing something else some type of shield buff. I don't know
[15893.50s -> 15903.45s]  I'm just a guy with a fucking bottle of liquor in a lighter new class
[15903.45s -> 15925.78s]  I'll do it after this is what it feels like to root for a losing sports team
[15926.18s -> 15944.08s]  Yeah, but eventually they're gonna win the World Series and you're gonna be so happy when they do just might take
[15945.54s -> 15959.22s]  70 or 80 years. Yeah, but that's also not a fair analogy considering
[15959.84s -> 15966.25s]  Okay, it would be like if I was playing a basketball game and I was the only player versus a whole team
[15966.37s -> 15970.12s]  They're like passing the ball back and forth
[15970.28s -> 15991.64s]  They like slap in five and I and I'm running around in circles. When is that stream?
[15991.64s -> 16001.83s]  Do you guys think that if I hired a professional basketball team to just go just versus me only?
[16002.43s -> 16025.45s]  Would I score one point in a full regulation game? What do you think? I didn't know you don't think so
[16025.47s -> 16029.34s]  I think I would do it. I think I could actually do it
[16031.54s -> 16036.02s]  What scoring one basket?
[16043.82s -> 16051.58s]  Can you just see in your head a team of like seven foot tall basketball players and me as like five eight Andy
[16051.58s -> 16055.73s]  I would go to shoot the ball and they would just just
[16056.37s -> 16063.24s]  Absolutely, just spike it down. Yeah, I would have to get a foul shot. I would have to get
[16063.60s -> 16066.95s]  I would just be flopping. You know what I mean?
[16067.17s -> 16071.04s]  Somebody would get it. I would run up and do go for a dunk and I would flop and be like, oh
[16072.48s -> 16081.28s]  Well, I was too that was too hard and then I get a chance
[16081.80s -> 16089.77s]  Your five eight was shoes. You don't think I'd be wearing shoes. I'll be wearing like basketball shoes
[16090.99s -> 16108.28s]  What?
[16108.28s -> 16115.58s]  No, no, that doesn't count either. I want that health back. I'm gonna wait. I'm gonna wait till that health is back
[16115.58s -> 16149.49s]  I'm waiting. I'm gonna wait till it's back. It's going in the review. What's happening right now?
[16149.59s -> 16171.45s]  Can't even leave do you think if I just stand here somebody will eventually walk by like what if I'm just a prisoner
[16171.45s -> 16190.62s]  This are paying as a prisoner. Oh, I'll tell you in locked in here all this time
[16190.62s -> 16199.23s]  I just wish I'm able to rescue me or something. All right, give it out there

[16689.12s -> 16704.56s]  Okay, it never turned on they couldn't hear you good. It was the little indicator down the lower left
[16704.64s -> 16710.35s]  Yeah, they were like they were answering questions. Did you do a wizard voice?
[16712.14s -> 16721.84s]  All right, let me see here. So this is a swing
[16722.00s -> 16732.42s]  We select a spell from your memory to cast fireball slow haste invisibility magic missile
[16732.54s -> 16753.76s]  Okay, so I fires pretend home. So is that on? Okay, do a Deckard Kane RP
[16754.77s -> 16761.12s]  Maybe maybe another minute or two. They've been a minute. Does the mage does not have a torch
[16761.12s -> 16814.47s]  Oh, yeah, I can't wear any of this, you know, just throw one down easier that way. Ooh, what's that ancient scroll?
[16814.61s -> 16864.66s]  That was a wizard thing. I'm doing this wrong. Oh wizard battle. That's actually really fun
[16864.94s -> 16935.59s]  What happens if you run out of spells? Oh, that hurts me. Oh, this is a trial run. This is a trial run fuck
[16935.91s -> 16967.25s]  Using everything I have here
[16968.01s -> 17005.48s]  I'm in trouble now. Is there a heel? Oh, that's the other that's the other caster. What does haste do faster?
[17005.48s -> 17028.11s]  You don't really tell you meditate to recharge. Is that a certain button combination? Oh really vulnerable here really vulnerable
[17028.17s -> 17041.35s]  Oh, it's only one recharge
[17041.75s -> 17111.76s]  Your headshots matter with that or no, they do. Oh big pog move the big chest. I don't think I can
[17124.30s -> 17132.62s]  All right, I'm just gonna try to get out. I'm just gonna try to survive
[17132.78s -> 17164.32s]  Okay, the goal is just just try to get the hell out of here portal. Get me out. Oh fuck
[17168.52s -> 17212.80s]  Don't mind me. I'm not sure they saw me. I'm just running around looking rooms for portal. Oh, I feel like there's one in here
[17228.78s -> 17245.66s]  Thank God, I didn't see what it was. It was a ranger 15 armor plus two magical heal. Wait, I could I can wear it
[17245.66s -> 17255.14s]  No, I can't so okay if you find a good item like this for another class
[17255.14s -> 17264.94s]  I can't it's not a shared stash, but I can trade it to
[17265.42s -> 17276.03s]  Myself or just trade it you trading post it to others
[17276.15s -> 17293.00s]  Do not sell blues to NPCs trade them to the other players in the market really you would that's so cool. That's so cool
[17293.02s -> 17302.28s]  I'm gonna fill my inventory with blues
[17302.40s -> 17315.16s]  I'm gonna sit in the fucking trade server and just drink like six Mountain Dews and just trade like hats for refined and shit
[17315.16s -> 17335.18s]  All right, made it out alive
[17335.90s -> 17359.19s]  We go all this other stuff is kind of trunk trunk trash and junk combined
[17359.19s -> 17381.09s]  Are there other spells besides the one that they're more spells?
[17381.25s -> 17420.61s]  This is the coolest part of this whole game by the way, but this is by far the coolest thing the menus
[17420.61s -> 17427.70s]  Yeah. All right. Let me look at my spell
[17428.18s -> 17449.98s]  Here was zap. Wait, what is this? I don't get it. Good night skill one skill two
[17450.42s -> 17460.36s]  Spell memory priority, you'd have two sets of spells equipped, but it sucks
[17460.52s -> 17479.09s]  So just keep it on this keep it on one. Oh, I see the cost limit
[17479.61s -> 17489.27s]  Actually haste is good for trying to run around and find stuff. I'll get rid of it. I just want all offense
[17489.31s -> 17519.54s]  Let's try his app magic damage bonus melt. Oh, I want yeah this for sure 20% cast speed. Hell
[17519.56s -> 17544.27s]  Yeah, can I get a hell yeah in the chat, please? All right, let's keep going. I made some money. That's cool
[17544.35s -> 17559.62s]  Hell yeah, are you addicted yet?
[17559.62s -> 17572.27s]  I've been addicted since probably the first hour this game does this thing where it lets you keep stuff and there's rarities
[17572.47s -> 17585.62s]  It's it's just kind of scratch that itch for a ton of people addicted but bad
[17585.78s -> 17593.22s]  Hey, where does it say that you have to be good at a game like this to enjoy it? I've done I've done
[17593.22s -> 17603.38s]  Okay, I didn't mean to do that. They're not allowed to make fun of me
[17603.38s -> 17675.17s]  It's my stream that count as a spell this wizard sucks, dude. You kind of stink at this Jesus somebody die
[17675.69s -> 17697.89s]  Holy shit, that was a weird 3d movie
[17697.89s -> 17707.91s]  Um, okay
[17707.91s -> 17733.59s]  So that takes a lot to kill things if I had voice chat on I was gonna be like don't fucking do that
[17733.59s -> 17738.72s]  So what would some of us are trying to look at our menus and we don't want sounds to have be in our ears
[17738.84s -> 17764.48s]  Don't fucking do that. That's BM majors PvP. Do some more RP. All right fine. Oh
[17771.98s -> 17780.81s]  Goodness me. No, if I say so myself, I seem to be

[18177.62s -> 18181.92s]  I'm just a lonely mage trying to find watch out for the skeleton. Oh
[18183.16s -> 18200.79s]  Little sticks. Hey adventurer. I know a few tricks little faster now now, aren't we?
[18201.31s -> 18209.78s]  Now this I believe there is a gigantic diamond hidden in this cave somewhere
[18209.78s -> 18236.58s]  I saw it one time 25 years ago. Yeah, let me help you out with the more haste. Let us go back up adventurer
[18237.04s -> 18247.89s]  Fireball incoming nice swing now the fireball coming out here
[18255.44s -> 18258.60s]  Excellent work. You sure do know how to use a sword
[18258.60s -> 18266.62s]  I know quite a few people that would be very interested in how you are using that weapon
[18266.66s -> 18274.14s]  I'm from the adventurer's guild up north very far north
[18274.30s -> 18291.61s]  It's very chilly where I'm from as you can see I'm wearing all these robes down here and close that door
[18291.87s -> 18305.86s]  Even wanted anybody to be sneaking up on us. What is your name? Ah, Mike, I'll get this one
[18308.50s -> 18311.42s]  Would you mind if I meditated for just one moment, please? Ah
[18325.14s -> 18342.00s]  Refreshing adventure. This is probably a bad way to go. Oh my skin hurts. Yes. Yes, of course
[18342.00s -> 18352.50s]  We need to go this way all the way looking for a diamond a crown made out of jewels
[18353.89s -> 18356.26s]  emeralds rubies
[18356.28s -> 18359.80s]  Adventurer, have you ever held a ruby before in your hands? Oh
[18366.44s -> 18368.70s]  You've had it the whole time
[18368.70s -> 18380.24s]  By gravy. Well now we can leave I don't need to stay here any longer not exactly what I was looking for
[18380.24s -> 18391.56s]  I do feel awful though. Make sure I have a power spell just adventurer. Where did you go?
[18392.70s -> 18400.18s]  Adventurer, I might have something for you adventurer. Holy show
[18400.74s -> 18404.46s]  Grisness of adventurer. I'm gonna give you something and I want you to make sure you understand
[18404.48s -> 18408.36s]  This is a very expensive item and that's what you get for being on my team
[18408.36s -> 18434.76s]  I'd venture up this way if you see a portal by any chance, please. Let me know. I'm so old
[18434.76s -> 18443.61s]  I should be the one to go first. Yes, of course. Yeah, what a nice young man. You really are
[18443.61s -> 18460.07s]  Oh, they think that they can use magic on us. Don't they how does that sound?
[18471.99s -> 18484.15s]  I hope he gets out with that blue. I really do
[18488.28s -> 18495.98s]  Failed that guy fucking hated you. I don't think so. He's got a blue. He's got a blue. He's getting out of there
[18495.98s -> 18512.05s]  All right, one more RP and then I'm gonna go back to plan this time
[18512.05s -> 18533.85s]  I'm gonna be a dark wizard. Well, that's when you that's when you turn it off
[18564.00s -> 18566.22s]  Well, let's play
[18566.22s -> 18582.24s]  Unfortunate fireball. What is the range for this to actually hurt me? Am I in a cell? Oh my goodness
[18582.26s -> 18614.08s]  I went into a cell. How did I back into a cell? What was that? I didn't hit apply. It looks like it was off
[18614.08s -> 18643.21s]  That's pretty good stuff. Is there a heel that way? This is oh, this is a heel. Is it a full heel?
[18650.21s -> 18660.96s]  Somebody kill me. What's that? Did I kill him? Did I just kill myself because of the magic missile? Oh
[18662.84s -> 18665.14s]  Dear oh me oops
[18665.54s -> 18683.36s]  Accidentally magic missile to ground. All right, this one's for real. Let me try. Hold on. Let me try the Ranger
[18683.42s -> 18695.45s]  I feel like the wizard is really really awesome, but I think you really have I think you need to be like a little
[18696.21s -> 18726.22s]  More familiar with the whole game range. Yeah, range. Yeah, it seems really cool though. This seems like the the kid is really fun range
[18726.22s -> 18749.25s]  Yeah, no range. Yeah free. How does this work detect recent enemy footsteps? That's cool
[18749.57s -> 18766.16s]  Forage food light speed projectiles a greatly increased in addition physical attack powers increase. Okay, that's cool. That's pretty good
[18766.54s -> 18805.82s]  That's pretty good too 15% more headshot damage. I'll try that was the loadout the bow
[18805.98s -> 18820.26s]  All right. Let me try it. The multi shot one is super good. How does it work? It's I get six shots you hold it
[18820.34s -> 18826.41s]  There's a lot of drop on it though. Okay, that's a lot of drop
[18826.41s -> 18851.66s]  I gotta be ready for that range of voice probably something like this if I were to say something like this
[18851.70s -> 18864.68s]  You think you're so powerful waving around that two-handed axe. Okay, I don't like this
[18865.34s -> 18883.78s]  Where why am I in vents? I don't have a melee weapon. Do I just eat wood off the ground? Oh that's okay
[18883.78s -> 18927.08s]  Oops, how do I get out of here? Do you have infinite arrows? Oh, fuck you. Oh
[18935.24s -> 18986.72s]  I kind of like it. It's kind of fun. Can I break this with arrows another pick lock?
[18986.72s -> 19008.78s]  I don't seem to have any close range. This one's open pretty good. You can get a sword. Maybe I'll try it out
[19008.78s -> 19066.76s]  Walk over here wizard shoes. Get him. Ah, ah
[19088.91s -> 19089.95s]  Oh
[19089.95s -> 19111.34s]  I'm to go holster the bow to go faster. Oh
[19121.87s -> 19130.51s]  No, I want that chest. Oh
[19141.44s -> 19165.82s]  Never mind. Goodbye. So the sacrificial altar. What do you do? What is that? Oh, no, this is bad
[19165.82s -> 19169.62s]  I'm in a lot of trouble here. I gotta I gotta just drag them this way
[19185.21s -> 19199.25s]  The teammate revive, oh, that's pretty cool. Okay, cool. Holy shit just run. What is that? I don't know. I'm dead
[19202.12s -> 19211.46s]  Thousand there was so much shit. I'm dead. Yeah. Goodbye. It was like a thousand spiders in that room
[19211.54s -> 19224.53s]  There's just so many people. There's so many things close the door behind you. Yeah. Yeah, I know I know
[19224.89s -> 19232.51s]  Honestly, I just trying to get used to how to shoot the bow
[19240.46s -> 19265.46s]  Triple shots amazing. It's gonna land some headshots on some people. I want some garlic bread. Um
[19269.32s -> 19277.91s]  You know, what's really weird and I've never said this out loud. I don't think anyone's ever heard me say this
[19277.91s -> 19287.41s]  You know what? I want a steak. Is that weird? I want a steak right now
[19288.96s -> 19298.68s]  I haven't eaten a steak. I mean when we're talking about like a fork and knife. I want a steak like
[19299.44s -> 19310.54s]  Steak, I think it's been probably 10 to 15 years since I've said that I don't really eat steak
[19310.70s -> 19324.46s]  Yeah, I'm not sure what put me in a steak mood
[19324.54s -> 19330.86s]  Yeah, no, it's been probably at least at least 10 years since I've wanted to eat a steak
[19330.86s -> 19348.35s]  I guess I could just sit up here and just sniper. Ah
[19349.59s -> 19364.18s]  Oh, that's good, but I'm gonna have to wait
[19364.28s -> 19393.25s]  I was saying it a lot last night because the eternal cylinder. Yeah, you're right. All right, you look ridiculous
[19393.65s -> 19402.24s]  Can you die already if you got low iron? Hmm. That's an interesting theory
[19402.28s -> 19445.48s]  What's the netcode like on this? How much should I lead people pregnant cravings?
[19445.48s -> 19450.75s]  Um, no pregnant craving would be if I were to say I want a steak
[19450.83s -> 19473.58s]  But I want you to marinate it in cool whip first somebody else here they together who you shooting at who you shooting at
[19473.60s -> 19504.43s]  Are you shooting me? Yep. Oh god. Damn it. Um, okay, so
[19505.31s -> 19520.32s]  People are fighting. It's I think that I think one's dead. Oh, you're coming after me, aren't you?
[19520.32s -> 19529.42s]  I don't know how I survived that and really don't I got no arrows. I'm in trouble here. Yeah
[19529.54s -> 19537.28s]  No, this is not getting out of that
[19537.28s -> 19552.40s]  I mean, honestly, you should have just started killing the stuff
[19552.40s -> 19568.72s]  We were both dead was like four or five enemies behind like right next to us first PvP kill of the night
[19568.72s -> 19574.66s]  Well, that's not true
[19574.66s -> 19578.60s]  That would be oh, I don't know how I'd feel about that if that was a accurate statement
[19580.52s -> 19592.20s]  That's at least the third or fourth PvP kill of the night at least five
[19592.20s -> 19610.00s]  I missed some raids didn't I shit honey Goblin came in with a raid honey Goblin rated last night, too
[19610.00s -> 19617.03s]  And that's where if you're still here from that raid, which I see I think that was hours ago. Thank you
[19617.03s -> 19630.98s]  All right, caught it like three and a half hours late. You did not hit me with that
[19633.39s -> 19646.12s]  What is it going for your wing? It's horse shit, dude. Why are there so?
[19646.82s -> 19654.06s]  Many of you honest to goodness. What the hell I know I'm supposed to close that door, but I had to
[19658.02s -> 19701.28s]  What's going on? Okay. I'm fine. It's a little sloppy, but whatever what's going on
[19722.11s -> 19753.33s]  Welcome to odds right in the face a wonderful word of odds that class seems
[19754.25s -> 19786.31s]  Unbelievably good rogue is a hard time with mobs Rangers. Not a solo class
[19786.31s -> 19802.39s]  I probably shouldn't be playing it then the fighter I think the fighter is probably the class
[19802.39s -> 19813.84s]  I could try barbarian feel like that would be my speed big heavy swing hit head P break
[19813.84s -> 19829.02s]  Um, I'll probably I want to keep playing but it is getting kind of late. I want to get out one more time
[19829.02s -> 19904.02s]  I want to escape one more time shoot. Oh fuck
[19932.64s -> 19972.84s]  Terrifying. Oh shit. Somebody's here how to go just in case somebody follows me down here
[19982.04s -> 19992.49s]  Somebody's asking if there is a proper solo queue. There is there is a solo mode now. It's very very hectic
[19992.49s -> 20010.59s]  It's very scary. That's I would say it's very difficult. It's the game. That's the way they get the name of the game
[20010.59s -> 20043.57s]  It's not called easy and easier. It's called fucking hard and harder. Please. Let me loot these chests in peace, please
[20043.61s -> 20074.30s]  I'm still alive. That's a good thing 15. Wait, is it faster seven bow? Oh seven. Okay, I'll try it
[20074.30s -> 20090.06s]  That damage is pretty bad though. Your mom's sick. I gotta go to bed. I hope you feel better. Oh, this is bad
[20090.06s -> 20142.10s]  Yeah, I'm in trouble wrapping around. Give me a good bow. Give me a blue bow 29
[20142.36s -> 20163.68s]  Better. Oh my god. I thought I had an extra second. All right, give me a portal. Give me out of here
[20163.68s -> 20209.39s]  There is a person portal. That's way too that room is way too dangerous. Oh shit. I'm in trouble
[20209.39s -> 20242.26s]  I don't think I have any potions or anything. Do I could be worse. This is a good stream
[20242.26s -> 20250.22s]  Oh, I'm glad you think so. The game is very very fun
[20252.15s -> 20254.35s]  This is gonna be one of those games
[20254.35s -> 20258.33s]  I think that it's gonna have a lot of fans
[20258.45s -> 20284.60s]  There's gonna be a lot of people that are gonna be playing this very very frequently. I'm just gonna go
[20293.71s -> 20295.71s]  Oh
[20296.25s -> 20313.79s]  Very bad everywhere. I just leave another archer here. Oh, yeah. Come on. There's a portal somewhere
[20313.79s -> 20360.62s]  I don't really have very much. Yeah, I have some jewels. I have some stuff crouch. I step in my own trap
[20361.88s -> 20370.28s]  What just happened? I didn't know you could do that. I didn't know you could do that
[20370.28s -> 20375.10s]  I thought it was like it's mine. So therefore the game doesn't I didn't know you could do that. Ah
[20380.49s -> 20390.49s]  Thought it was mine. Yeah, and I even still tried to jump
[20391.27s -> 20400.54s]  All right, it's a fun class but I feel like it's a classy where you need to have like support, okay
[20400.54s -> 20427.12s]  I'll try but I'm gonna try barbarian for two times co-op with somebody
[20427.12s -> 20436.70s]  Um, that'll be probably something that has to be planned because it's um, it's very very late around almost the whole world
[20436.78s -> 20441.26s]  So I think that's something that hey you want to do this on
[20442.02s -> 20456.35s]  Thursday or something, right? I think that's got to plan it up a little it's 6 p.m. In Australia
[20457.28s -> 20467.65s]  Hey, hey ones in chat if you if you're if you're from Australia, where am I? Where are my Australian friends at? That's a lot
[20467.65s -> 20500.84s]  Wow, okay. I get it. I feel it. They're different swing. It's a sideways swing. Oh get out of here
[20501.60s -> 20526.62s]  This is a really bad place to spawn. Yeah, a lot of the it's a lot of people that are around right now. It's a lot of
[20527.76s -> 20528.92s]  Australia
[20528.92s -> 20547.75s]  Asia too, right New Zealand. Yep. So I'm yeah, but you're up to because you're probably waking up right now
[20547.81s -> 20558.62s]  I like the late-night crowd you guys you guys have been really really not like it didn't don't get me wrong. Hey
[20573.93s -> 20576.55s]  Thanks, I don't get me wrong
[20577.03s -> 20579.96s]  every time zone has
[20580.12s -> 20586.87s]  You know this this perks to every time zone. Well, this is the first time I've ever streamed like this
[20587.39s -> 20597.72s]  Somebody's coming. Oh, okay. Yep. Ow, you got it. Oh
[20606.29s -> 20608.72s]  Yeah
[20608.82s -> 20615.77s]  Yes, you lied to me you lied to me that is that is be a way this different person
[20615.89s -> 20621.05s]  What'd you lie? Why would you lie to me? You're the two. Oh, why would you do this to me?
[20621.09s -> 20631.20s]  Why would you do this to me trader trader? What the heck you lied to me?
[20631.20s -> 20642.08s]  You did the squat squat. I lied to was it a different guy. They would look like they were together
[20642.36s -> 20660.70s]  He was waiting for backup bunch of bastards. I'm telling you to a man party. Only one was friendly
[20661.16s -> 20672.92s]  Would you ever visit Australia?
[20672.92s -> 20680.75s]  Australia seems like equal parts one of the most beautiful remarkable places on earth while also being one of the most terrifying places
[20680.75s -> 20697.26s]  I would never want to go like I would want to experience Australia in a in a helicopter
[20697.38s -> 20704.31s]  You know what I mean? Like holy shit. Wow. Look at this. Look at how amazing this is. This is so beautiful
[20704.91s -> 20713.79s]  Don't let don't land though. Don't land. I hear there are spiders as big as two fists. I
[20714.51s -> 20717.78s]  Thought we'd fly over
[20717.84s -> 20749.26s]  Now is there a parry or no, is it just power all jokes aside though?
[20749.26s -> 20756.83s]  I would I would it's definitely on the bucket list the places that are interesting to me
[20757.15s -> 20770.58s]  Dude, you got a really wide swing. Yeah
[20771.50s -> 20806.87s]  Maybe barbarians not for me. This is a little harder than I thought it was gonna be
[20807.23s -> 20823.92s]  Japan's another one a lot of places in Europe to like you guys know
[20823.92s -> 20870.07s]  I've never left I've never left in North America for like any reason ever don't trust anybody. Oh, no. Oh, yeah
[20871.04s -> 20876.96s]  Probably eventually I imagine I'll do a kind of a world tour at some point
[20876.96s -> 20891.86s]  Maybe into my 40s or 50s or something world tour announcement. No
[20895.75s -> 20901.15s]  That's why I'm gonna be going to every major city in the world a
[20905.18s -> 20924.47s]  Hundred cities in a hundred days, you know what I really want to do
[20924.47s -> 20928.82s]  I just I just want to go into a bar in Scotland
[20928.88s -> 20938.53s]  Just like sit down just get whatever they have on tap and just have somebody just talk to me
[20938.53s -> 20950.60s]  You know what? I mean, I just want to sit there on that stool and just look over to the left and right and just like
[20950.60s -> 20984.78s]  What's what's your story? What's your story? Let me hear it. No bar. Yeah a pub. That's what I mean. It's very profound, dude
[20984.94s -> 20997.67s]  I'm serious though. I think that's like would be nice dude. Yeah, I just like said that's everybody be like, oh my god
[20998.17s -> 21006.14s]  He's he's so well traveled and he's so he just wants to like have a conversation
[21006.86s -> 21018.58s]  You won't be able to understand them, but I could nod I could nod
[21018.94s -> 21053.18s]  Don't cast a spell at me. Did you miss the legendary ancient scroll? I don't need that shit
[21053.30s -> 21064.24s]  Do you think I need the legendary scroll? No, give me two packs of cigarettes and a fucking axe. I'll be done in an hour
[21077.91s -> 21097.02s]  Get your whole fucking crew, huh? Get your whole crew out of here. Ah, ah
[21102.69s -> 21118.70s]  He was one hit I'm alive just so dark bro, you died to a friar
[21118.86s -> 21126.80s]  Hey his buddy jumped on my back and when it wasn't hey that was I that was 2v1
[21154.26s -> 21163.50s]  But yeah, I think there's a lot of cool places to see the thing about the United States if those you bet
[21163.50s -> 21169.20s]  It may not have ever been here. The United States is very very different across the whole country
[21169.48s -> 21179.83s]  It's almost like four or five different countries. There's so many wildly different climates wildly different people
[21180.05s -> 21193.54s]  It really does sometimes feel like a few different countries. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we got multiple Star Wars worlds stole that from chat
[21193.54s -> 21221.73s]  I don't really understand how to play barbarian. It's like I swing and then I just like oh fuck
[21221.73s -> 21225.86s]  Is there am I missing something here like I'm getting hit way too much
[21225.86s -> 21268.67s]  I'd rather eat 50 hot dogs or travel the world. Why can't I do both of those things?
[21268.67s -> 21284.87s]  You're thinking too limited here. I have to choose one. I would want it. I would travel the world
[21287.34s -> 21291.38s]  Yeah, you can get a hot dog whenever you want to get a hot dog traveling the world something
[21291.38s -> 21299.66s]  That's kind of a big deal. I could eat a hot dog every day for the next two months
[21299.66s -> 21308.63s]  I mean, I wouldn't want to do that, but I could but it's 50
[21308.69s -> 21325.82s]  Yeah, the 50 hot dog sounds like a punishment not a reward. Hold on. Ow
[21326.34s -> 21346.36s]  Alright, I'm gonna hurt. Alright, so I oh shit my bleeding. No, that would be unfortunate. I think I might be
[21350.64s -> 21372.01s]  Hold on. Yeah, give me a sec. Okay, so the issue that just happened. Damn, okay
[21372.11s -> 21376.62s]  So let me explain. No. Yeah, I am shit
[21378.21s -> 21383.18s]  Give me one second. I'm fine. Don't worry. So this is actually kind of funny
[21384.58s -> 21393.34s]  I'm a bloody nose right now and it's because there was a really hard ass booger in my nose and I just went to like
[21393.34s -> 21401.70s]  Kind of rub my nose and this really hard booger just hurt me. It's kind of funny in a way, but like fuck it sucks
[21401.70s -> 21711.43s]  I'll be right back. That's unfortunate. You're back. He ripped his own brain. I'll be right back. I'm back
[21711.43s -> 21719.66s]  So I didn't realize it wasn't at a BRB screen. I'm good. I have
[21720.18s -> 21734.10s]  Tissue paper stuffed up my nose. Hey booger boy. Yeah, can we see no?
[21734.10s -> 21744.84s]  I I got a I got a some I got some liquidation here. It'd be hard to drink this in my nose though
[21744.92s -> 21760.77s]  That's hard to do. Did you at least eat the booger bro?
[21761.75s -> 21764.55s]  What do you think? No, shut up
[21766.11s -> 21772.32s]  Time that person out for I don't know that few days. I don't know. Shut up. No, I didn't it's disgusting
[21772.34s -> 21783.22s]  That person for a week. Okay. Let me try I
[21787.58s -> 21817.95s]  Want to try let me go back to them the thing I was doing before even gonna play scorn. Let's go prepared
[21817.95s -> 21836.48s]  Let me just take all this stuff. I got plenty of money. I'll try this one more time. This is so hard though
[21845.61s -> 21852.22s]  Yeah, I don't really know what happened. It does get very dry out here. It's very cold and it's very dry in Vegas right now
[21852.22s -> 21854.81s]  I'm not really prone to nosebleeds
[21854.81s -> 21862.44s]  But I think there was just there was a one a little too hard in there and I rubbed
[21862.44s -> 21867.63s]  I got I do this thing a lot. I don't know if it's just something. I don't know. It's a call it like a
[21869.49s -> 21870.65s]  kind of
[21870.65s -> 21877.34s]  Compulsive thing that I do but I a lot of times I will pinch my nose and like kind of pull down a little
[21877.46s -> 21880.28s]  Just I kind of rub like pinch pulp. I do it all the time
[21880.40s -> 21886.39s]  You probably see me do it on camera a lot where I kind of like take my my index finger in my thumb
[21886.39s -> 21893.22s]  And I go like just rub pulp. I do it all the time. So I did that and
[21894.95s -> 21899.48s]  Caused a nosebleed somehow
[21900.42s -> 21909.09s]  That does sound like a really really suspicious way to tell everybody that as a nearly 40 year old man
[21909.09s -> 21917.91s]  I was picking my nose when you couldn't see it. Well, you see
[21919.91s -> 21987.77s]  All right, let's go I'm fighting the boss one two shit three hit combo. I got that
[21995.43s -> 22006.57s]  Against the wall
[22006.93s -> 22063.19s]  Don't even I'm fighting this don't hurt me not again fucking die. Oh my god. Damn it
[22063.35s -> 22075.90s]  I can't I can't back up back up back up bang into wall. Now you're in trouble
[22075.90s -> 22100.94s]  I have no idea if I was even close but whatever. Oh, yeah, I forgot I got attacked
[22103.94s -> 22125.38s]  75% just started aggroing stuff in the room and at that point it's just over. It's late
[22125.38s -> 22141.50s]  It is late, but I'm a late-night Andy now. Oh, I'm just gonna leave
[22142.14s -> 22164.00s]  Let's just go back in here. He's dreaming of that Scotland pub
[22164.00s -> 22184.66s]  You think it's the earwigs in your brain that are making you slowly nocturnal or earwigs nocturnal. Ooh
[22195.28s -> 22201.79s]  Okay, pretty good
[22204.46s -> 22217.62s]  Diamond back here or something get back here. Can I just hide here the whole match?
[22218.66s -> 22238.36s]  Unfortunately, I am NOT near the center. I want to take you one at a time, please
[22238.56s -> 22249.01s]  Don't you dare come together? He seriously hit me in the fucking head. Oh my god. Oh my god
[22249.01s -> 22256.77s]  I can't I I died in two arrows. Did he headshot me twice in a fucking row?
[22256.91s -> 22265.10s]  I died as I shot 15 arrows at somebody and hit him in the head 15 times and they didn't die
[22265.10s -> 22282.62s]  I got hit to a two arrows and I'm dead aim really high with the shield. It's awkward. Jesus
[22283.26s -> 22317.26s]  Crouch and aim stupid high. I like this comment you muppet. You keep costing me a thousand points
[22317.86s -> 22327.04s]  What's the statistics here? How many bets have there been and how many have actually how many have I won?
[22327.04s -> 22330.70s]  How many have I you know? Oh, I made it out for three
[22331.00s -> 22335.46s]  Like 30 those odds are very bad
[22335.86s -> 22343.59s]  You can't put it on double zero every time with the rule of table and when the dealer is like, oh, sorry
[22343.59s -> 22351.53s]  It's a it's a red 20. Yeah, you fucking muppet. Why is it not on the green one the one in one out of 35? Oh
[22354.08s -> 22361.00s]  Shit, I just blew my snot thing. I gotta put this back in
[22361.72s -> 22369.68s]  You're betting
[22369.68s -> 22372.40s]  Against the edge. There's an edge here and you're betting against it
[22373.22s -> 22380.58s]  Stop trolling it. I
[22381.94s -> 22388.70s]  I'm this game. Yeah, fuck you fucking muppet. Oh
[22399.73s -> 22408.19s]  I'm telling you stop that in green stop betting zero and double zero. It's not gonna come up
[22408.19s -> 22429.09s]  You need to you need to be betting a strategy bet, right? I'm gonna damn it. This one's so hard. Okay
[22430.38s -> 22446.30s]  I'm gonna do this one. You didn't even put a an English accent on while doing the muppet
[22446.32s -> 22449.41s]  I didn't I don't know if that person's English
[22454.78s -> 22463.48s]  So many people have lost money. We're okay right now. It is 270 K 4 million
[22463.64s -> 22469.76s]  It's not good. It's not good. The believers have been drained
[22470.46s -> 22480.33s]  Completely 200 K to 4 million. It's we're kind of bleeding out all the believers
[22480.33s -> 22485.13s]  I've actually kind of feel bad. I need some of these believers to get a big win here
[22486.63s -> 22492.55s]  Otherwise only gonna be doubters with them with the with the capital. I can't have that
[22493.07s -> 22506.94s]  I'm trying as hard as I can know. I can't have that. It'll just be all doubters. Let's go. I'm gonna turn it here
[22506.94s -> 22563.56s]  It is somebody's close. Oh
[22563.76s -> 22611.97s]  I'm in the left. There's still many archers in here. No, fuck you. Give me all your stuff
[22611.97s -> 22627.40s]  Give me everything you own. Stop rolling. Stop rolling. Stop rolling. What do you have? I took okay
[22627.40s -> 22632.57s]  I got everything actually don't need this shit
[22632.57s -> 22644.36s]  17 no, I have a lockpick which can get you fuck this up. I'm gonna be very pissed off at you
[22644.38s -> 22683.36s]  I need health though. I can't use the fuck. What's that? What's just why did the clock just appear whatever?
[22683.36s -> 22698.62s]  Okay, I I just I looked away for one second
[22698.62s -> 22711.30s]  I was like, oh, that'll be fine and cool lockpick. All right potions this I actually I have to get out from this one
[22711.30s -> 22728.08s]  I do look at all these trinkets and shit. I got to get out of here healing potions or something
[22728.08s -> 22745.30s]  Come on, they live. Thank you. What the fuck? Oh, it's a mage
[22745.48s -> 22788.62s]  What a little bubble time to go in a minute in a minute in one minute
[22788.62s -> 22873.02s]  There's one or is it to loot loot loot nice worth it. Oh, I'll take it something
[22873.02s -> 22887.48s]  Wait, did you make sure you fight as many monsters as you can? Hey, dude, I see what you're doing
[22888.30s -> 22903.37s]  Look at this little fucking place
[22906.50s -> 22956.34s]  That doesn't really help me. Nice. Okay, don't want to fight that. I'm just gonna go this way. Okay. All right portal portal is somewhere
[22956.34s -> 22991.50s]  We've got some dead bodies portal. I just heard one. Where is it? I just heard one. Oh my god
[23002.96s -> 23004.52s]  Yes
[23004.52s -> 23012.16s]  Believers believe it. I'm gonna call that and I'm an unbelievably clutch
[23012.56s -> 23024.48s]  Molotov to buy me the time to open the portal to get the heck out of here. Yes
[23024.64s -> 23033.87s]  Look at all this shit. Look at all this and I left I got it. Didn't I get out with something pretty nice?
[23033.89s -> 23051.98s]  I swear I got a oh the blue is the last round when I yeah, that was unfortunate huge payout
[23051.98s -> 23062.00s]  I'm actually so sad. Oh, well, the odds weren't that good. I would have oh no, I feel bad
[23062.40s -> 23082.90s]  You didn't win. Oh, oh no, everyone's sad. Well that that worked. Okay, let's get some money
[23097.23s -> 23110.18s]  Hmm. There's gonna be a lot nice nice nice nice nice
[23113.35s -> 23121.10s]  Ooh, ooh. Oh, yeah, this is big money now. Look at this
[23122.89s -> 23123.89s]  65
[23123.89s -> 23157.15s]  Gold who wants to buy this thing? I'm gonna actually hold on to this like a crystal ball is pretty good to have for a wizard
[23157.23s -> 23171.31s]  Hey, well, what if I play with a wizard? Who knows? Hey, I'm saving this for Holly
[23172.05s -> 23185.99s]  She's gonna play a wizard. Um
[23186.59s -> 23199.67s]  Only four gold and I feel like yeah, whatever those worth a lot
[23199.67s -> 23241.96s]  I've got a pretty decent amount of money now. Do I dare gamble it? Of course not
[23255.75s -> 23299.51s]  No, I'm saving it. Why do I have multiple torches? I will buy a weapon though
[23306.99s -> 23339.08s]  22. Hmm. None of these are any good. I got bandages. I'll buy potions though. I would why these here
[23341.71s -> 23342.91s]  19
[23342.91s -> 23344.15s]  health
[23344.15s -> 23363.54s]  54 that sounds just that's just like awful. All right, I'm gonna do another one, but I have perks
[23363.58s -> 23375.27s]  I have stopped bleeding. So that's good. Do a high roller. I am NOT ready
[23375.27s -> 23376.67s]  You want me to go into high roller looking like this?
[23376.67s -> 23382.57s]  I'm wearing an elf costume with a fish tank on my head
[23382.69s -> 23387.69s]  You want me to go into the high roller zone and get fucking one shot by somebody's legendary weapon
[23387.69s -> 23423.85s]  You just want to see me lose a hundred gold. Hmm. Yeah guys. I have a serving tray for a shield
[23423.85s -> 23432.48s]  It's gonna get attacked the legendary ice sword of the mountain and it's gonna crumble and it's gonna split me in half
[23432.48s -> 23439.31s]  All right, I'm just gonna do I'm just gonna go again
[23439.31s -> 23446.85s]  Actually like last one probably for the night because I mean I do you know, I am very very into it
[23452.19s -> 23475.57s]  He's never gonna say hi to smush. You know, the worst part about this is I really like this game and they're about to take
[23475.57s -> 23487.83s]  It away from me in like five days. They're gonna take it away from me
[23487.83s -> 23495.82s]  I wonder when the actual just kind of beta just like it's open and it's gonna be there for a while
[23497.26s -> 23500.72s]  I wonder when the beta actually will be because it's supposed to be coming out at the end of the year
[23500.72s -> 23515.61s]  Is that full on 1.0 right? This is just a play test. Yeah, I think it's in my personal opinion playing this
[23515.61s -> 23519.26s]  I feel like it's almost
[23519.62s -> 23548.31s]  At that point where I think they could probably slap a beta on it, but that's you know
[23549.67s -> 23553.35s]  Okay, I have to win this but that's also just me being selfish and
[23556.72s -> 23562.94s]  You know, I got I want to play it so that's you know me being selfish
[23563.62s -> 23588.92s]  What is that spider don't play Tarkov Tarkov is like this right same kind of idea but with machine guns
[23588.92s -> 23602.73s]  I actually prefer this than that. I prefer the sort of dungeon kind of medieval fantasy. He's here
[23602.73s -> 23608.08s]  I don't know what the hell he's doing. Oh, come on
[23619.00s -> 23622.78s]  There's no getting out of this I
[23623.22s -> 23653.46s]  Can kill your fucking priest? I'll be happy you have the best take sometimes
[23653.46s -> 23661.44s]  But then you ruin it by talking about drinking your own piss or something. All things must be balanced
[23661.44s -> 23685.11s]  What if I talked about drinking my own piss? That's I've never said that. Oh
[23694.32s -> 23696.20s]  I whatever yes, right
[23696.20s -> 23700.55s]  I said I was people gave me shit cuz I had a water filter and I was like, oh, it's great
[23700.55s -> 23702.39s]  And they were like, oh actually that water filter sucks
[23702.39s -> 23715.16s]  And I was like I'll piss in and drink it and I never did it. Yeah, I remember it's like
[23715.16s -> 23717.04s]  Oh, man, that water filter dude, it's like a scam
[23717.04s -> 23720.72s]  I'm like what he did like I could piss in this thing and drink it and it was like to do it then I was
[23720.72s -> 23723.37s]  Like I will and then I just got called out and didn't do it
[23723.49s -> 23748.84s]  I hate that you just hit me. That's so unfair
[23776.99s -> 23784.54s]  Somebody's shooting me with a bow and fucking arrow and I don't know if it's a person or if it's a monster
[23784.94s -> 23792.41s]  That's just not gonna happen
[23792.57s -> 23801.08s]  This guy's buddy just died and I'm just gonna absolutely
[23801.80s -> 23816.67s]  Scared this shit out of him here. Oh my god, your friend had nothing. Your friend had nothing. What the fuck?
[23816.91s -> 23831.36s]  Well, good luck cuz now we're both fucking dead. What was he invisible?
[23831.92s -> 23839.91s]  He's invisible, wasn't he?
[23839.95s -> 23847.00s]  Invisible, how long can they stay invisible? Are they actually invisible invisible? Or is it kind of rogues can go invisible?
[23847.16s -> 23861.45s]  How long does it last? It's until that way is it it's like shadow meld from Warcraft every day
[23861.45s -> 23875.60s]  I you know every day I just see how good this class really is about 20 seconds if they're stationary
[23875.60s -> 23904.13s]  I remember when a rogue used to kill me in wow, I would have a fucking mental breakdown
[23904.13s -> 23912.66s]  I remember just questing in like Stranglethorn Vale and you would hear that
[23913.58s -> 23916.50s]  Kidney shot of whatever wasn't just couldn't move and then it was like
[23917.38s -> 23927.26s]  Who and you stunned again and then that person would just sit there for like an hour and I would just get my body
[23927.26s -> 23928.74s]  And they would just do it again
[23928.74s -> 23945.51s]  Just like log off bro log off. I was that guy were you you're a real piece of work. I'll tell you
[23945.51s -> 24014.24s]  I just said the ceiling that's very good believers. Are you there? I'm proving my usefulness
[24038.46s -> 24062.29s]  Start is this is he just running around the circle turn the brightness down. No, I can't play it
[24062.29s -> 24070.05s]  I can't play it unless the brightness is up like 20 30 percent at least my eyes are so bad my you know
[24070.05s -> 24075.72s]  It's crazy my eyes when I'm looking at a monitor or worse than just real life
[24075.72s -> 24121.52s]  I don't know why that is boomer eyes. Oh shit. What happened to this person? Oh, sorry, man
[24121.52s -> 24135.36s]  I'll take this I tried to help him I did but this game this game is
[24137.46s -> 24155.71s]  This game is pretty pretty hard we leave me alone for one second. Oh my god, you fucking little shits. I'm gonna wrap around
[24156.23s -> 24212.89s]  I'm over here, man. Hey, it's a little slow. Dude. Where's Mike? Oh my god
[24212.89s -> 24219.72s]  I thought this is gonna be so much easier. I thought this is gonna be so much easier. Holy shit
[24219.72s -> 24237.48s]  That was a disaster. No, don't even please don't please please not right now getting kind of just destroyed at every turn
[24237.48s -> 24247.62s]  This is so bad. This is bad. I'm in trouble. Holy shit. You saved my life
[24247.70s -> 24258.77s]  Thank you for the love of God close this door for the love of God closer, okay
[24260.33s -> 24279.64s]  Okay portal. Oh dear careful. Careful. There's a monster behind you. I gotta be honest. Oh shit
[24281.28s -> 24308.38s]  No fall damage, right? Okay. Wait, I need a portal. What happened the mage act the goblin mage killed me
[24308.38s -> 24317.64s]  Well from that far away. I got sniped from that far away. He jumped down
[24318.48s -> 24337.23s]  Well, I hope you get this these items. That's sad
[24337.79s -> 24344.93s]  Alright, this is the last one. This one counts. This is the one that
[24345.55s -> 24353.58s]  Really counts this one counts. None of the other ones did I've been playing for about seven hours
[24353.58s -> 24355.62s]  These were all tutorials leading up to this
[24356.30s -> 24387.51s]  Exact one right now all led up to here. Hmm. What do you got you two are together?
[24389.56s -> 24393.91s]  What about you?
[24393.91s -> 24415.13s]  That means you need to refund all previous bets. Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say that's not gonna happen
[24419.36s -> 24427.29s]  I'm getting out. I'm gonna leave here with like 300 gold. Let's do it
[24427.29s -> 24499.88s]  You should turn the monitor off for this one. That'd be actually really funny. The gas following me. Okay, I got some replacements
[24499.96s -> 24518.10s]  This is just junk, but I'll take it. Alright, let's keep going. I'm gonna actually go around your time
[24518.14s -> 24580.64s]  Is this poison somebody else's down here? It isn't poison. Thank goodness. Somebody's down here
[24580.64s -> 24644.65s]  You better not be full of shit. Nice the code. Yeah. Alright the the adventurer code. Alright, let's get out of here
[24644.65s -> 24683.98s]  Oh, he's meditating whoo you you coming or do you need help? Why am I talking like you can hear me?
[24683.98s -> 24723.16s]  Yeah, I got full health. I don't know if you can hear me. No, you can't I got you. Don't worry
[24723.16s -> 24761.36s]  I'll protect you. Okay, then go over here. Be careful. This is really dangerous a wizard like you. He's hallucinating again
[24761.36s -> 24776.49s]  This isn't even a multiplayer game. I don't understand what what Jeremy's talking about
[24776.49s -> 24779.61s]  He's been playing Scrabble on stream for the last six hours
[24780.13s -> 24783.85s]  Against the computer. I don't what is he talking about like swords and stuff
[24783.89s -> 24818.01s]  I'm just like taking everything and stuff sucks friendly. There's a boss down there. Can we kill it together?
[24818.33s -> 24826.23s]  Well, we're gonna have to figure that out. We're gonna have to go. We're gonna have to do it. I think it's mine
[24826.23s -> 24830.52s]  Holy shit. Oh my god
[24832.12s -> 24839.76s]  That's a fucking purple. That's a purple bro. I'm leaving. I'm out of here. I'm fucking out here. It's mine. It's all mine
[24839.76s -> 24849.75s]  Oh shit, we slept we separated. Is this cool? Wait, could he use that? Maybe I could give it to him
[24849.87s -> 24854.32s]  Hold on. Hold on a minute here. Hold on a second here. Hold on a minute. Hey, hold on a minute
[24854.32s -> 24858.20s]  Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold on. Everybody's relaxed. Everybody relaxed for a second. I'm freaking out
[24858.20s -> 24873.98s]  I can't jump that wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What is who is it for?
[24875.19s -> 24879.64s]  Warden Ranger is do we have a Ranger anywhere over here?
[24879.64s -> 24895.16s]  I I actually would give it to the Ranger if there's a Ranger here give him the crystal ball
[24895.16s -> 24910.88s]  Oh, hey, can you use them? Should I do the Diablo 2 thing where you like dropped it on the ground?
[24910.88s -> 24913.16s]  I picked it up really quickly just to make piss everybody off
[24916.12s -> 24921.20s]  Please to do that and any time it got grabbed it was they would just leave the game. They were just an exit
[24921.20s -> 24924.16s]  I'm not gonna dump kidding
[24924.16s -> 24932.79s]  I would never do that but like if there really was a Ranger with us, I would absolutely give it to them
[24933.31s -> 24941.46s]  Because like that's fucking cool. I just too bad. It's not for a wizard. You probably should go over here
[24941.46s -> 24948.31s]  I used to do that in fucking tibia
[24948.31s -> 24954.26s]  Oh
[24959.50s -> 24964.62s]  See you later. See you later. See you later. Have fun everybody. Have fun. I got a fucking purple
[24964.62s -> 24967.89s]  I got a purple. I got a purple
[24967.89s -> 24989.55s]  I wish there was a Ranger in our like part of that little group because if you drop that for somebody that's actually using that
[24989.55s -> 24993.10s]  Class and they would just it was like holy shit
[24993.10s -> 25005.96s]  Did really like if somebody dropped me something for that could use quick end the stream
[25006.00s -> 25021.11s]  I will probably hold on to this because I will probably I'm not gonna I'll probably give this to somebody
[25021.11s -> 25024.33s]  Oh, by the way, let me like ask like an actual question here
[25024.33s -> 25027.95s]  Like I know I was just kind of fucking around was that like BM. I don't want to be like that guy
[25027.95s -> 25029.79s]  I know we're just kind of fucking around here
[25029.79s -> 25036.35s]  But is that like is that BM or anything like was I like a dick for doing that like be honest with me?
[25036.35s -> 25055.38s]  Cuz I don't I don't want to like, you know, yeah, who's it? Yeah, the wizard was the one who killed it
[25055.38s -> 25073.17s]  I just I just saw it die like I just saw fucking red and it was like a purple
[25073.17s -> 25098.34s]  I just picked it up and I freaked out leaving him stuck. There was meaner. It's true. Is there any way to do recent players? Oh
[25101.05s -> 25117.14s]  He feels bad. Well, I just I like don't know the etiquette and even if there is not I mean here's the thing
[25117.14s -> 25120.55s]  It is like it's just like a demo. So it's not like
[25123.01s -> 25135.82s]  But I don't be like a dick you would leave in a heartbeat if you if you were German
[25136.46s -> 25143.45s]  Is there actually like a recent players list cuz I will just send it to them. I really don't even care
[25143.45s -> 25148.50s]  I don't want to be like an asshole. It was like funny for a second and I'm like, wait a minute
[25148.50s -> 25153.83s]  That is actually really good and somebody could probably sell that but it is like five days left on the beta, right?
[25153.91s -> 25174.91s]  You're thinking too much about it. Yeah, I probably am it's a beta. There are no rules. That's true. That's true
[25175.03s -> 25201.37s]  Maybe if it was a legendary should I should you use the gathering halls be happy about it? Yeah
[25202.05s -> 25214.36s]  Trade what if I went into trade? I was like, hey the wizard that I just took that purple from did please DM me
[25222.24s -> 25231.46s]  The DM for BM he gave you the gloves you drop you have the odd that and 2020 hindsight
[25231.46s -> 25243.46s]  I should have just dropped that for him. I feel bad, but it's all good. Don't forget to stash it
[25243.46s -> 25254.98s]  Yeah, I got it right here. Dude. You gave him a magical globe. That's right. I did dude. Don't worry
[25254.98s -> 25262.79s]  What if he's a terrible guy in real life? That's not the point. That's not the point
[25262.95s -> 25274.44s]  He he probably thought the orb is what you got. Yeah, I should have just gave it to him. It's all good
[25274.44s -> 25314.18s]  All right, one more I'm gonna keep this. Where did I get this from? Oh
[25315.45s -> 25321.17s]  My god, this is for a wizard. Oh my god. How did I not see this?
[25321.17s -> 25328.35s]  I did I get that too. I gotta get in contact. I got I gotta fucking hit that guy up
[25328.35s -> 25333.95s]  I took all of his stuff. I gotta give him that fucking dagger. I have to I have to find that person
[25334.71s -> 25361.32s]  Fucking terrible. All right, let's I'm gonna play another one stash it for you
[25369.48s -> 25373.24s]  Screaming it's all mine and then I feel bad
[25373.24s -> 25380.50s]  I get my brain just like didn't piece together like what I was doing and I'm just like, oh, yeah
[25380.74s -> 25385.30s]  Wait. Oh, right. This is the people here. That's fucking

[25438.69s -> 25462.97s]  Nobody has to remember their name. Oh, you have stream remote on steam recent players. I don't have I'm not really maybe I can see
[25468.68s -> 25496.48s]  Recent game now one of the things up top wizards. There's only 18 wizards in the whole game name and karma
[25496.48s -> 25500.16s]  It'll show you oh that I knew it was somewhere
[25500.24s -> 25512.37s]  Oh, there was no there's no there was no teammates because we weren't technically in a team together
[25512.37s -> 25536.41s]  All right, let me sell this stuff and we'll we'll do one more. He's gone forever
[25536.53s -> 25566.36s]  How many more one more is a good question gotta be extra generous next time to make up for it
[25566.36s -> 25590.55s]  Yeah, I will atone for my sins. I will it's so funny cuz it's
[25591.39s -> 25597.99s]  Calling with the ring or something. I spent the last seven hours playing and like I've haven't been playing very well and all of a sudden
[25597.99s -> 25600.47s]  Like oh my god amazing. I don't take it
[25601.90s -> 25603.66s]  Yes, like it's right
[25603.66s -> 25651.92s]  Pretty good pretty good. You see your recent players. I just looked
[25652.60s -> 25671.10s]  There's nothing there. You were like a little raccoon. I know that's I got it felt like my god. I'm gonna die
[25671.10s -> 25717.92s]  Oh my god, I'm fucking sloppy right now dirty
[25717.92s -> 25729.95s]  I really do want to make it out because I have a lot of decent stuff. He said it's okay
[25729.95s -> 25744.73s]  It wasn't malicious. Yeah, but I still feel bad about it bugs
[25747.44s -> 25748.72s]  Yeah
[25748.72s -> 25775.52s]  Why is Bugs Bunny Peter Griffin the same character? Why is that they aren't it's just me
[25775.52s -> 25782.85s]  Yeah, my impression. Yeah, that's always scary every time it really is
[25782.85s -> 25798.73s]  All right, I'm just gonna move cuz kind of far away. I actually didn't his revenge. This is revenge for uh,
[25800.54s -> 25869.46s]  The Wizards revenge I was not altruistic enough. I can see names unless they're just scrambled nonsense. Are they he's addicted?
[25869.46s -> 25942.28s]  Yeah, I am somebody's behind that door. No
[25943.42s -> 25983.75s]  They were friends everything was going so well until you blinded by greed
[25989.74s -> 25993.44s]  Shit and he said hey, dude, does the stolen equipment work better? Oh
[25998.91s -> 26002.03s]  Okay, we laugh about this and it's like really not that big of a deal
[26002.03s -> 26008.45s]  I shit you not a couple hours from now. I'm gonna be lying in bed
[26008.45s -> 26013.30s]  You're talking to Holly and it's gonna be like I feel real bad about that wizard
[26013.30s -> 26031.77s]  I wonder if I can like reach out to him and give it back to him. Ow. Oh my god, don't even vote
[26031.77s -> 26034.57s]  It doesn't count. Don't even vote. It doesn't count. Don't even vote doesn't count
[26034.57s -> 26036.71s]  That's not that that one doesn't count up. Don't know that one doesn't count
[26036.71s -> 26047.20s]  There's been a few stinkers in a row it now that one doesn't count I walked out and I I was looking at chat
[26047.32s -> 26093.46s]  Well, you're gonna bet anyways, so this just pretend it's this one. All right
[26093.46s -> 26097.79s]  I had to pay I had to pay it forward over here. You shot me so I hit him
[26097.79s -> 26124.64s]  Hey, my buddy Eric just got his loot stolen by some jackass. Be careful. Damn shit
[26124.64s -> 26148.98s]  I'm gonna be on the lookout. I was waiting for you
[26148.98s -> 26152.40s]  I knew you were gonna do that and you still got me with it somehow
[26152.56s -> 26178.96s]  These are some really dog shit spawns the last two times, huh? I can die
[26184.00s -> 26186.36s]  That's pretty cool
[26186.36s -> 26261.57s]  Get this stink out of the way. You can't have any more in there. I can't believe this
[26261.57s -> 26288.19s]  I can't believe you still alive like I hit you a hundred times Jesus. Oh my god
[26288.19s -> 26322.52s]  I just want to leave but I can't walk up there. What is happening? What's happening? Let me help
[26322.52s -> 26396.78s]  I need that I need this and you're in the way. I got a plan. Come and get me now with it
[26396.78s -> 26423.68s]  Oh, you gotta be kidding me. You weren't even aiming at me. It's better than a player
[26427.08s -> 26443.64s]  What's this deal? Oh, I'm in trouble now. I'm dead. I just there's three people just fucking chasing my ass
[26443.64s -> 26487.20s]  Like you're doing great, sweetie
[26487.76s -> 26515.88s]  So here's the plan. I'm gonna do this one
[26515.96s -> 26528.82s]  I'm gonna do this one and then one more solo goblin world just for old times sake and that's it
[26528.82s -> 26534.95s]  And then I actually I have to go eat. I haven't eaten seven and a half hours. So I need to eat
[26534.99s -> 26572.88s]  I'm getting like brain fog. I'm just gonna I'm just gonna you know, I mean, I'm just gonna try to get away
[26572.88s -> 26589.05s]  I'm just gonna try to get out if they're red
[26589.05s -> 26601.23s]  Does that mean that they're stronger or have more health or something? Yes. Okay, that would explain the damage
[26632.34s -> 26647.26s]  How why am I not swinging to wait what what the fuck happened why oh you have to you have to hit right click
[26647.26s -> 26654.18s]  Then left click it's backwards. That's what the fuck. I come
[26654.18s -> 26658.95s]  I forgot just to do the swing to go one two with the swords
[26658.95s -> 26663.11s]  You have to do a right click then left click and not left click and right click you have to hit right click first
[26663.23s -> 26688.71s]  Now that was annoying that laugh. Yeah, so if you have if you have two swords, you can't press left click first
[26688.71s -> 26695.88s]  You'll just swing the left side. You can't do left and then right you have to hit right click first, which is come on
[26695.88s -> 26773.00s]  Gwen the heel. Okay, not bad. I have to get out of here though. Yeah, this is that this is truly the last one
[26773.00s -> 26787.57s]  Where the fuck are you? Oh
[26787.69s -> 26858.16s]  Just trying to get out of here without getting hit once. I actually have to get out of here now surprising that that did not kill
[26867.64s -> 26882.50s]  Jesus I got so complacent. I just was like, oh, I'm just like walking around just tacking random shit Jesus. No
[26882.94s -> 26891.46s]  No, no, no, no. Oh my goodness. What a disaster
[26891.46s -> 26898.84s]  Oh, come on, there's no getting out of that that one sucked
[26898.84s -> 26903.04s]  That one didn't count that one that truly was just stupid. That just didn't count
[26903.04s -> 26952.76s]  I escaped that shit turn around guy the bow and arrow. You just I'm just dead. I wouldn't count. I don't shit spawn. I
[26955.42s -> 26997.37s]  Just have to what is this a red bug what I can't move no matter what happens. This is it
[26999.57s -> 27007.49s]  Mmm, I could die in the first 10 seconds and that's it. I'll come back to it
[27007.49s -> 27033.12s]  Yeah, this is the final match no matter what happens next time. I will be in a party or maybe I'll play so I don't
[27033.12s -> 27035.92s]  I do but up you'll I'll be playing this again 100% this week

[27062.12s -> 27074.05s]  I know it's probably a whole crew that can get cycled in and out. Okay final one. This is it
[27074.05s -> 27113.07s]  I'm gonna actually I'm gonna just quiet down. I'm gonna focus. I'm gonna try to win way too many nice
[27113.23s -> 27145.86s]  Very good. Very good. Very good. Hello. Let's work together. You have a pickaxe. Oh shit. You get a bow
[27145.86s -> 27191.75s]  Oh fuck every friend I get dies or I steal from them. That was my fault. What did I do?
[27191.75s -> 27199.06s]  I think he just gets shot in the head by an arrow. They're sad. It's unfortunate
[27199.06s -> 27200.30s]  I shouldn't be laughing at that
[27200.30s -> 27217.50s]  But I mean, I feel like I've discovered people's bodies a handful of times here. Okay, I gotta get out of here
[27217.62s -> 27223.86s]  I'm not this open-ass room. No way. See you

[27354.93s -> 27380.50s]  Why just people just walking around backstage? We're not fighting this anymore
[27389.47s -> 27393.15s]  It's so bad I wanted to do it so bad
[27395.11s -> 27397.54s]  No
[27398.71s -> 27405.75s]  Wait the shield I thought I blocked it. No. Oh, that's so annoying
[27405.75s -> 27413.59s]  I thought I fucking had it. I was certain I like a purple was gonna drop and I was gonna it was gonna be a whole
[27413.59s -> 27420.53s]  Thing I was gonna turn the voice on I'm gonna be like, hey take that you've earned this. Oh, I had a whole thing planned
[27421.09s -> 27436.18s]  Shoot why am I a loading screen?

[27933.52s -> 27996.65s]  This is my sin corner. It's the guilt armor. All right, that was very very very fun
[27996.65s -> 28106.42s]  Oh, it's offhand. This is the comedy run. This one is not even real. There's no betting or anything
[28106.42s -> 28131.40s]  It's nothing about it's just a comedy run. See it's already funny. They're already really funny
[28131.40s -> 28160.18s]  This is such a bad spawn to new law. No, there's no way. All right. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow

[28192.08s -> 28201.36s]  There's only six days in this test and then they just wipe everything and they put it back in the oven for like another two
[28201.36s -> 28206.22s]  Or three months. Yeah, I'll see you guys on
[28206.58s -> 28209.60s]  See you guys on
[28209.60s -> 28226.04s]  Wednesday the eighth have an awesome rest of your night. Take care of yourselves. Get some sleep. See you later
[28226.04s -> 28228.74s]  Okay
[28228.74s -> 28253.41s]  Now that they all left everyone that wanted to go to bed that really needed to go to bed was like, all right
[28253.41s -> 28284.05s]  I'm going to bed. See that person's doing a comedy run. I can't do one more. It seems good. All right, it's confession time
[28288.68s -> 28290.68s]  What a terrible place for that to spot
[28291.08s -> 28296.26s]  No, get get me out of here. Let me out. Let me out. He's a rabid fucking animal
[28296.82s -> 28324.58s]  Like pretty good comedy run I would say peak comedy run
[28324.90s -> 28337.99s]  What was the confession in the first 30 minutes of playing this game? I thought it was fucking dog shit
[28338.69s -> 28352.16s]  Like in the first 30 minutes. I was like, wow, this game is fucking absolute dog shit. So this is awful
[28352.22s -> 28353.66s]  well
[28353.66s -> 28358.61s]  I'll play this for like an hour or two and then I'm fucking never opening this again and then um
[28358.85s -> 28363.62s]  And then I realized what what it was and and realized that it was fun
[28364.62s -> 28368.70s]  Now I am telling you this is probably going to be my favorite game of the year
[28373.10s -> 28375.90s]  This possibly could be one of my favorite games for the year
[28383.51s -> 28386.07s]  It's just it just grabs a hold of you
[28395.74s -> 28402.86s]  Yeah, I mean that's obviously a really bold prediction, but I I know how I am when I get in a game
[28403.42s -> 28410.81s]  And this is really fun. Even if it's like kind of a it's it's it's kind of it's rough, right?
[28410.97s -> 28417.24s]  But rough in a kind of a good way
[28417.24s -> 28422.33s]  Um, I know it's it's literally february and this game's not even out yet
[28422.73s -> 28434.54s]  But I could see myself jumping in this and just playing it and bashing my head against the wall. Oh shit. Sorry
[28435.16s -> 28452.57s]  Yeah, I lowered this accidentally. Thanks for watching. Thanks for staying up. Um, we'll play this again
[28452.65s -> 28457.21s]  I'll see you probably i'll ping some other streamers and see who wants to play it. Maybe on um on wednesday
