[1.78s -> 5.78s]  Alright, let's get let's get one thing straight before I've seen a lot of pogchamps. I'm seeing a lot of venus's
[6.02s -> 13.96s]  I'm seeing a lot of before you pogchamp. This ain't even real. This is an uploaded video
[14.52s -> 19.00s]  I want to make sure you're aware of that before we get started. I have a super
[19.88s -> 27.98s]  Streamer switch which if there's an internet problem for more than four days a video is uploaded and broadcast as if it was live
[28.79s -> 36.20s]  I'm currently crying in bed tears are streaming down my face because the internet problem has still not been fixed
[36.44s -> 44.76s]  So hopefully this little tidbit of content will be worth a little bit for you. Can you hear me crying?
[46.28s -> 48.84s]  Well, you can because this is recorded
[51.91s -> 54.30s]  How is everybody?
[54.30s -> 63.05s]  Alrighty, no, we are live. This is live. This is real, but i'm gonna be really honest with you
[63.05s -> 69.91s]  I haven't even tweeted this this is a let's see if it can stay on kind of moment here
[72.50s -> 79.11s]  I don't believe you. I i'll start reading names two two one one one one
[79.51s -> 88.52s]  Thanks for the comment there six two one one two one three three. Thanks for that comment
[88.52s -> 94.58s]  It's a good one. This is pre-recorded says
[95.51s -> 114.23s]  One two two two one one one zero zero. Thank you. Nobody said that now. How you guys doing?
[114.55s -> 119.72s]  I'm turning into a goblin. I really am
[120.12s -> 125.69s]  We're gonna relax for a minute here and I i'm not gonna turn the webcam on because I look like shit
[127.16s -> 137.67s]  You want to see a goblin? Would you like to i'm not sure if i'm like comfortable
[137.67s -> 141.61s]  This is like this is essentially me turning the webcam on and naked
[145.22s -> 148.82s]  I haven't i haven't looked in the mirror in like seven hours. I have no idea
[149.54s -> 151.85s]  I have dog hair all over me
[152.25s -> 154.25s]  It probably looks like such a psycho
[154.57s -> 155.93s]  All right. Are you ready?
[155.93s -> 157.93s]  All right. Fine. Are you ready? Let's see
[159.64s -> 161.88s]  Let's see. Well, I don't know what I look like. I have no idea
[162.60s -> 167.90s]  full screen
[167.90s -> 169.53s]  one
[169.53s -> 170.98s]  two
[170.98s -> 173.99s]  Three no, I look okay
[174.66s -> 180.44s]  Look at this look at like I have so much dog hair all over me. Oh, I know I oh no, I look bad
[184.22s -> 188.17s]  I look okay
[188.17s -> 190.17s]  I just look a little a little tired though
[191.05s -> 192.09s]  um
[192.09s -> 194.01s]  Not lipstick not this time. See
[195.21s -> 197.21s]  Um, i'm very tired
[197.66s -> 200.47s]  It's been a long three days
[201.27s -> 204.55s]  All right. Now let's get this off because I really am turning into like a fucking goblin
[206.07s -> 208.07s]  Am I wearing eyeliner?
[209.77s -> 211.16s]  No
[211.16s -> 213.80s]  I don't think so unless somebody put it on me
[215.05s -> 217.45s]  Well, I was like going just like this at the wall
[221.51s -> 224.33s]  I was like a stone person
[224.33s -> 226.65s]  No, this is just like i'm just like flush
[229.66s -> 234.28s]  But i'll give you the long and short of it. We've been dealing with this for three days now
[234.92s -> 238.52s]  I was up at seven o'clock this morning. I slept for like three hours
[239.08s -> 241.08s]  I've been trying to be on top of this shit
[242.20s -> 245.42s]  Get at it get at it
[245.42s -> 246.55s]  uh
[246.55s -> 248.55s]  And i've got some we got some
[249.27s -> 251.27s]  bad news
[254.76s -> 258.12s]  Bad news, it's not really bad news as much as it's just
[260.15s -> 261.59s]  I mean, it just
[261.59s -> 265.11s]  Sucks, but whatever
[265.11s -> 266.39s]  um
[266.39s -> 268.39s]  It's kind of like too long
[269.30s -> 275.06s]  It really is you know, like something's just too long to even talk about it anymore. I've been talking about this for less like
[276.37s -> 279.27s]  34 hours
[279.27s -> 280.07s]  so
[280.07s -> 282.47s]  I'd be tell you okay, you know when to go around at a
[283.27s -> 284.87s]  family get-together
[284.87s -> 288.23s]  And it's like let's say there's like 30 or 40 people there
[289.13s -> 292.41s]  And every single person that you talk to you have to tell the same story to
[293.94s -> 295.38s]  Hey, so
[295.38s -> 297.00s]  hey
[297.00s -> 298.20s]  Johnny
[298.20s -> 301.72s]  How's your school? You're an engineering student, right? What's that like?
[302.73s -> 304.01s]  well, um
[304.01s -> 309.77s]  Yeah, I was an engineering student. I you know, I work on engineering and uh, i'm making a i'm making this new plane
[309.93s -> 311.53s]  of architecture
[311.53s -> 316.41s]  And uh, i'm i won a award for it in the in the school paper and oh wow
[317.05s -> 319.05s]  Good to see you
[319.05s -> 321.05s]  And you walking away to the next person
[321.77s -> 325.05s]  Oh, it's you johnny. How it's you it's me aunt etna
[325.53s -> 331.61s]  You're in school, right? Yeah. Yeah in school. Oh as an engineering student that must be
[332.17s -> 334.60s]  That must be really interesting
[334.60s -> 340.58s]  Yeah, what are you gonna do? What are you been doing? Um, well, I uh, yeah, I got an award
[340.66s -> 345.62s]  I've got an award. I was working on this new plane thing plane. Wow. That's incredible
[346.26s -> 347.86s]  Tell me more
[347.86s -> 353.14s]  Uh, I got an award for i'm an engineering student. It's been you know, I the the food though the school food
[353.78s -> 357.14s]  Oh, it's kind of stinks, right? Right, grandma. Uh, yes
[357.70s -> 363.53s]  Oh, you're so smart. You're the smartest one and you keep going uncle lou
[364.26s -> 371.62s]  Hey, how are you johnny? I I mean I heard somebody told me, you know through the night that you're an engineering student
[372.50s -> 377.78s]  Yes, I am an engineering student. Oh, what's that? You must work on planes
[378.42s -> 379.80s]  Yeah
[379.80s -> 391.10s]  Yeah, I work on airplanes lou. Oh, wow. Have you won any awards? I've been doing that for three days
[399.24s -> 401.24s]  Tell us again
[403.45s -> 405.45s]  Save it for three days
[405.78s -> 408.22s]  Yeah, and I actually like
[408.70s -> 413.90s]  I I like time looped myself too, by the way, this is important because we're just hanging out right on you hearing this
[414.62s -> 416.62s]  So here's how I time looped myself
[416.86s -> 417.58s]  so
[417.58s -> 419.58s]  A person from maintenance was here
[420.60s -> 422.90s]  this morning, right
[422.90s -> 425.02s]  and I
[425.02s -> 430.86s]  There was a bunch of bullshit. It turns out there's like a saturated node, you know, i'm an engineering student
[430.94s -> 433.34s]  I work on airplanes, you know the blah blah blah, right?
[433.98s -> 435.50s]  so
[435.50s -> 438.94s]  He gives me the idea. Hey, you should get a static ip address
[439.50s -> 441.66s]  that will probably that maybe that'll help you with traffic and
[442.06s -> 446.70s]  um, you know, I got an award for an award for my airplane design
[447.34s -> 448.94s]  So I call up
[448.94s -> 450.94s]  the cox tech support
[451.02s -> 453.51s]  To try to get a static ip
[453.59s -> 455.99s]  So the guy on the phone
[455.99s -> 460.57s]  Is telling me oh, yeah, we're having problems issuing you this static ip
[461.13s -> 463.13s]  uh, it's
[464.46s -> 469.42s]  No, I can't talk right now. I don't want to talk about my engineering degree anymore. This is damn again
[470.46s -> 471.50s]  No
[471.50s -> 473.74s]  I'm not answering. I'm not talking about my engineering degree anymore
[474.63s -> 475.83s]  so anyways
[475.83s -> 477.75s]  static ip
[477.75s -> 481.35s]  They're telling me that they can't do it. There's a problem. There's like an issue with the static ip
[481.59s -> 484.15s]  And i'm like, what do you mean? What's an issue? Oh my god, what's happening?
[485.11s -> 488.23s]  Uh, fuck
[488.23s -> 490.47s]  I can't answer this on stream. That's not cool
[492.04s -> 493.88s]  What if they were like quick?
[493.88s -> 497.56s]  We're detecting router levels of over 400 degrees
[499.40s -> 501.80s]  Tell me where you what do you what do you do for work at school?
[502.76s -> 505.08s]  I got engineering. Yeah. Yeah
[506.52s -> 514.81s]  The router
[514.81s -> 523.19s]  anyways, uh the
[523.98s -> 528.30s]  The engineering student that talked no, i'm not doing the webcam. I look like fucking trash
[528.94s -> 532.74s]  I'm gonna mute the volume for now and keep the music background music's nice
[533.38s -> 535.54s]  So static ip, right just listen listen
[536.57s -> 537.93s]  They tell me
[537.93s -> 541.05s]  There's a problem here with your static ip if the phone rings again, I swear to god
[541.85s -> 545.29s]  No, it didn't so the static ip
[546.49s -> 551.45s]  Could not go through and the guy couldn't figure out why so he told me well, hold on a minute here. I
[552.09s -> 556.84s]  I actually see there's an outage in your area. I was like really
[557.64s -> 558.76s]  What are you talking?
[558.76s -> 559.88s]  Yeah, yeah
[559.88s -> 564.12s]  It looks like uh, this is probably what's going on with the static ip. Oh, you're getting packet loss here
[564.12s -> 566.76s]  There's somebody's going to be out there to uh fix that
[568.22s -> 570.60s]  There's an outage and i'm sitting there going
[571.72s -> 573.72s]  No, that's that's me
[574.36s -> 578.60s]  I i'm going like a full-on go back in time time loop scenario
[579.32s -> 582.28s]  Where like I was the one that had the guy come out?
[583.08s -> 585.08s]  to try to fix the packet loss
[585.48s -> 587.64s]  And the guy thought it was an outage in the area
[587.64s -> 594.46s]  But he's talking to the person that like caused the guy to come down. So I I didn't even say anything
[595.11s -> 596.79s]  I was like, oh wow
[596.79s -> 599.35s]  Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, I think there's something wrong with the line
[599.91s -> 602.38s]  Yeah, I mean
[602.38s -> 603.74s]  Got an award
[603.74s -> 611.32s]  For that so as it stands right now, we're switching to a static ip and it's maybe gonna help
[611.88s -> 613.88s]  but the super duper long
[614.12s -> 617.43s]  sad story is
[617.43s -> 622.31s]  It's not gonna fix the problem because we have like a saturated node and it's gonna take them
[624.42s -> 626.98s]  Uh, this is not a joke. I'm not kidding. This is real
[631.13s -> 632.89s]  It's gonna take them
[632.89s -> 634.89s]  10 years to fix it
[641.35s -> 643.35s]  It's gonna take 10 years
[643.83s -> 646.15s]  Yeah, well, you know, we're working all this stuff and uh
[646.87s -> 652.87s]  The plan is to have it all done in 10 years to like replace all the nodes and stuff and i'm like wow 10 years
[655.32s -> 657.48s]  At least my children will have good internet
[658.76s -> 661.16s]  No, no, no the static ip might work
[662.25s -> 665.13s]  In fact, we haven't dropped any frames so far. It's just all over the place
[665.13s -> 670.73s]  There's nothing I can do about it. So the real end of the story to move on and we're gonna play garden flipper
[671.29s -> 673.66s]  If you were curious
[673.66s -> 678.54s]  is vegas has done a lot of development in the last year like before
[679.34s -> 686.25s]  Um before we got here it they've dialed it up to a thousand fiber is now starting to become
[686.97s -> 688.97s]  Oh my god. Why did I just say it?
[691.13s -> 693.13s]  Why did I just say that
[701.43s -> 705.35s]  I don't know what happened man. All I all I picture is like, okay, you know like the cartoon
[706.31s -> 709.27s]  like in the in the cartoon with a guy like if somebody has like like
[709.75s -> 714.95s]  Like the charcoal all over their face and their hair is out like this and they're like like kind of dirty
[715.67s -> 720.07s]  All I picture is like that guy like with like frayed out air and like the loony tunes like
[720.79s -> 723.19s]  I don't know man. I I pressed a couple of wrong buttons
[729.21s -> 731.64s]  400 degrees
[731.64s -> 732.76s]  See in 10 years
[732.76s -> 740.47s]  No, but it also might have been like all the water all the rain that vegas has had but to we'll put a cap on this
[741.61s -> 743.21s]  Fiber is coming out here
[743.21s -> 748.49s]  It's coming everywhere. There's a ton of new development and even if it means that I have to move
[750.10s -> 752.10s]  Like down the street
[753.24s -> 757.34s]  That's not a problem. That's not a big deal and you do what you got to do
[759.80s -> 762.52s]  Just move down the street to get fiber
[764.95s -> 769.03s]  That is a very real possibility if we keep having problems, right? Let's
[769.91s -> 774.02s]  Look, I am not going to be the one to tell you just move
[778.76s -> 780.57s]  but moving
[780.57s -> 786.31s]  Right down the street to get fiber or to make sure that it's there on like some of these newer developments
[786.31s -> 789.51s]  So where there's there's like hundreds of them. They pop up everywhere
[790.92s -> 795.98s]  All over the whole entire like las vegas valley everywhere and that the guy told me
[796.38s -> 799.82s]  All these huge new developments that they're going all over the place here in vegas
[800.06s -> 804.25s]  They're all gonna have fiber laid out there and i'm like, oh, all right. Well, maybe i'll look
[807.16s -> 810.12s]  vas vegas i'm sorry i've i've been sleepless
[810.68s -> 813.85s]  How long have i've been live?
[813.85s -> 815.85s]  uh 14 minutes exactly
[816.25s -> 819.13s]  Just get elon muska's internet
[819.59s -> 820.73s]  muskas
[820.73s -> 824.50s]  Elon musk's elon musk get elon muska's internet
[828.79s -> 833.35s]  But I can't let it bother me. I'm not gonna you know life's too short
[834.38s -> 835.93s]  to
[835.93s -> 837.05s]  Get bad
[837.05s -> 840.81s]  I'm just like it's just i'll i'm just i'm just fucking hanging out. You know what I mean?
[842.90s -> 844.07s]  So
[844.07s -> 845.62s]  Here we go
[845.62s -> 849.06s]  Uh, what we're gonna do today is we're gonna see how long we can be live for
[850.18s -> 855.51s]  we're gonna get the static ip change over tomorrow, hopefully that helps and
[856.31s -> 858.31s]  They are going to monitor us
[859.51s -> 862.79s]  And just make sure that nothing really major happens, but you know, whatever like you can't
[863.51s -> 870.52s]  Life's too short life's too short to pay premium internet prices for internet that will be installed in 10 years. What's going on?
[871.16s -> 878.28s]  What's going on?
[878.28s -> 883.72s]  No, no. Oh, you guys are like scared. Okay. I might be like overtired. You guys just scared the shit out of me
[885.50s -> 887.50s]  I thought that was like somebody in my room
[889.11s -> 891.11s]  What's happening? What did I say?
[895.69s -> 897.53s]  I'm sitting here going
[897.53s -> 901.29s]  This is somebody like gonna like strangle me behind me. Why would that happen?
[905.72s -> 907.72s]  Uh, oh monga ish
[913.21s -> 915.21s]  But we're just gonna chill we're gonna hang out
[915.94s -> 921.86s]  Uh, we'll see how long we can go. Um, this might not be a very long stream. I'm sorry
[922.42s -> 924.18s]  but you know, sometimes
[924.18s -> 925.70s]  it's
[925.70s -> 927.70s]  What is it? Let's go through the stages
[928.58s -> 930.31s]  anger
[930.31s -> 932.74s]  denial and then
[934.44s -> 936.44s]  Super saiyan and then
[937.72s -> 940.86s]  uh out of mana then
[943.98s -> 947.42s]  uh superimpose no, uh, whatever it is
[948.40s -> 950.04s]  impose
[950.04s -> 955.80s]  Imposition on somebody and then denial again and then you accept your fate
[956.20s -> 963.43s]  I think we're pretty much somewhere in the acceptance stage denial too is real
[971.75s -> 975.35s]  But this is garden flipper. Uh, don't pay no attention to the house
[977.45s -> 979.45s]  Oh, hold on a second here
[980.95s -> 982.95s]  Look in the lower left corner
[986.01s -> 988.01s]  Hey Jeremy, it's me
[988.09s -> 990.09s]  I'm calling you from my home office
[991.08s -> 994.12s]  The degrees went so much higher than I originally anticipated
[996.90s -> 1000.04s]  I was trying to fix it
[1000.52s -> 1004.36s]  And then I did like a 1980s home alone style movie thing
[1004.68s -> 1009.00s]  Or I grab the two ends of the wires and connect them and then it is explosion
[1017.83s -> 1026.55s]  Sorry, i'll get back to you. This house sucks. But who cares? We're doing gardens today. Oh, there's the laptop
[1028.33s -> 1030.33s]  I had to put it on a cool surface
[1030.57s -> 1037.08s]  It's been a long time since we've been in this game
[1037.48s -> 1039.42s]  crack outs
[1039.42s -> 1044.04s]  We're gonna learn how to play garden flipper a bit of gravel and a couple of bushes
[1044.52s -> 1047.64s]  Hello, I work at home in my dentist's office
[1048.20s -> 1051.48s]  I can deal with all kinds of teeth cavities but not with the holes
[1052.12s -> 1053.72s]  And weeds in my garden
[1053.72s -> 1056.68s]  Please lay some gravel on the front part of my yard to get rid of these also
[1056.68s -> 1061.16s]  Could you plant something on there to make it look better? This is a stay a stay at home dentist
[1065.32s -> 1068.04s]  That you work at your your home is the dentist
[1073.91s -> 1077.37s]  That's kind of weird

[2386.09s -> 2387.85s]  But I don't think it is
[2387.85s -> 2392.89s]  You see what i'm talking about?
[2392.89s -> 2394.89s]  See that shouldn't shouldn't that be covering it?
[2397.10s -> 2399.22s]  Okay, that's fine
[2399.22s -> 2401.22s]  See look at see
[2401.38s -> 2403.99s]  What the hell?
[2403.99s -> 2405.43s]  See look at that
[2405.43s -> 2419.06s]  This is this too hard landscaping is too hard
[2426.01s -> 2429.61s]  How many I have to like pull the fence up to get this under here. That's not part of the job
[2429.77s -> 2434.82s]  It's fine. This one's done
[2434.82s -> 2437.18s]  Yeah, no, this is we're good
[2437.18s -> 2438.54s]  mow the lawn
[2438.54s -> 2440.30s]  mow their lawn
[2440.30s -> 2445.10s]  I have to mow the neighbor's lawn. Look at that. I'm not doing that
[2445.82s -> 2457.85s]  Yeah, me and ted have an agreement
[2461.38s -> 2464.06s]  My son used to do it
[2464.06s -> 2467.00s]  But he really didn't give a shit
[2467.00s -> 2470.76s]  He just well, uh, by the way, i'm projecting here. This is me i'm describing
[2470.84s -> 2473.16s]  So when I used to get like asked to mow the lawn
[2473.56s -> 2476.60s]  My father would say go mow the lawn give it come on help out try to jump up in the yard
[2476.60s -> 2478.65s]  I'd be like, okay fine
[2478.65s -> 2480.73s]  And I'd go out there and we had a pretty big yard
[2481.29s -> 2483.35s]  And what I would do
[2483.35s -> 2490.07s]  Is I would start in the middle. No, no, no, I would end in the middle. I would end in that
[2490.15s -> 2492.15s]  I would just do a giant circle
[2492.63s -> 2493.67s]  right
[2493.67s -> 2498.95s]  So I would start like on the edges and I would go like this around in a huge circle
[2500.52s -> 2502.52s]  And then I would line the tires up
[2503.34s -> 2507.18s]  With the where the you know the end of where I end so I made like a giant spiral
[2507.18s -> 2509.18s]  So the next pass would be like this
[2509.72s -> 2512.49s]  And then like this and then like this
[2513.45s -> 2529.54s]  Like this until you got in the middle. That's how you mow a lawn. No, it's not
[2530.10s -> 2532.10s]  You're supposed to go like straight up
[2532.82s -> 2537.06s]  And then straight down lining up the tires. So you so you get a straight line
[2537.70s -> 2546.38s]  The background the background the backyard used was a giant spiral and my father was pissed
[2552.12s -> 2555.24s]  and then there was a part of the yard where so the dogs went out and
[2556.04s -> 2559.48s]  There was a little section of the yard that they would go to and there was like a rock out there
[2559.48s -> 2562.28s]  And they peed on it and they like kind of shit out there
[2562.84s -> 2567.32s]  And I would always avoid it because I didn't want to like run over dog shit
[2573.56s -> 2576.04s]  I would like avoid because I didn't want to like go out there and like
[2576.60s -> 2580.84s]  Clean it up and then mow the lawn and my father would always be like what you missed the dog pen
[2581.91s -> 2583.91s]  Oh, yeah, I do but it's okay
[2584.39s -> 2589.21s]  I'll get i'll get it later and he'd be like, oh my fucking shot
[2597.27s -> 2600.15s]  Okay, is this done 48 percent. What am I missing?
[2607.11s -> 2609.83s]  Is it taking in the equation the whole thing over here?
[2610.47s -> 2619.37s]  I can't sell the grill. That's too bad. Look in the mini map
[2619.93s -> 2622.41s]  Yeah, it's all this shit
[2622.41s -> 2626.55s]  But I can't get rid of this
[2626.55s -> 2630.94s]  Does this count as they don't want me to get rid of this? I don't want to okay
[2631.42s -> 2643.05s]  All right, let's at least do this. Can I get a bigger roll of tape?
[2644.41s -> 2649.85s]  I can't make this bigger
[2649.85s -> 2655.11s]  Big roll. Thank you. Jesus. No, wait a minute. This is too big
[2666.52s -> 2668.52s]  Waste
[2669.24s -> 2671.24s]  And throw the rest in the trash
[2674.23s -> 2682.71s]  Shit, it looks like but that's correct though. Look at see
[2683.51s -> 2687.18s]  That that decay if I click right now doesn't that look correct?
[2687.74s -> 2690.55s]  Look at where it's lining up at the edges
[2693.27s -> 2695.83s]  See that that's this like right in the corner there, right?
[2697.58s -> 2700.38s]  It's from the bottom of the roll. So like this
[2712.50s -> 2717.14s]  Start from the fence
[2717.14s -> 2719.14s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no
[2719.30s -> 2723.34s]  stay
[2733.51s -> 2737.35s]  No, they'll figure it out. Watch this be watch this be the phone call. That is
[2738.79s -> 2745.67s]  Mr albertson we're going to be shutting your internet out for about 30 minutes to do the static ip change
[2746.15s -> 2750.71s]  If you could do me a favor and just not use your internet stay far away from it
[2751.27s -> 2764.36s]  Well, you'll find out in a second here. What a waste. I know but don't worry
[2768.15s -> 2770.15s]  We're gonna go down and then i'm gonna cut that
[2774.68s -> 2776.68s]  It's all right. Just get tweezers and you pick that up
[2777.34s -> 2779.98s]  This is done. I'm learning still i'm just learning
[2780.86s -> 2783.50s]  Let's get the even um, let me see what the smaller one looks like
[2784.84s -> 2786.84s]  Look, here we go. This is a perfect little roll tape
[2799.91s -> 2806.84s]  Why I mean it's
[2806.84s -> 2808.84s]  I need to like move their fence
[2809.62s -> 2813.54s]  Hey, I can't I can't sell their fence and I can't move it. So like I can't do that
[2815.46s -> 2818.66s]  I i'm sorry that you you're not gonna let me move your shit
[2819.38s -> 2837.37s]  I can't wait till I get a real lawnmower. I can't wait to show you guys
[2837.37s -> 2839.37s]  I'm gonna cut the lawn like I used to
[2839.69s -> 2841.69s]  And we can compare the two ways
[2843.62s -> 2845.86s]  You're not gonna let me uproot your whole fence
[2847.50s -> 2849.50s]  No, I just need to move it
[2850.79s -> 2853.91s]  Well, why did they decide to do this? How you can't do it like this?
[2858.14s -> 2861.93s]  It actually looks kind of good
[2861.93s -> 2864.42s]  Up the game audio
[2867.58s -> 2879.54s]  How is it that's probably a little better take a dip in the pool
[2881.06s -> 2883.70s]  Uh, that's unfortunate. It's it's called out. I can't
[2884.58s -> 2896.66s]  It's a glass pool
[2896.74s -> 2901.18s]  Internet what do you guys think is the next step of the internet?
[2910.79s -> 2912.89s]  gardeners
[2912.89s -> 2917.82s]  Gardener jesus. Oh, no, no, no that okay. Never mind. I was like, what does that mean?
[2919.74s -> 2924.60s]  100 wireless. I don't want that
[2924.92s -> 2930.06s]  Any other like fucking boomers in this chat like actually scared of like 7g
[2930.78s -> 2933.85s]  I'm gonna start growing horns
[2948.90s -> 2956.63s]  Imagine not wanting horns and like the telecom companies will all spin it. You know what I mean?
[2957.35s -> 2961.82s]  There'll be like a hearing
[2961.82s -> 2965.82s]  Well, you know the thing is everyone has started to grow two extra eyes
[2966.46s -> 2968.76s]  But now you can see twice as good
[2969.72s -> 2974.07s]  I see that as a plus
[2974.07s -> 2976.39s]  Okay, this is what's the other percentage here right here?
[2983.94s -> 2989.19s]  97 90. All right. There it is 100 complete. I didn't have to do anything else
[2995.69s -> 2998.65s]  Oh, yeah, the the senator from new york would like to ask a question
[3000.10s -> 3004.50s]  Yeah, uh, so we've got four eyes now, but two of them throw up blood
[3005.22s -> 3009.91s]  Every six hours. Well, I think that's just progress, you know
[3017.80s -> 3027.56s]  We're done. That's a cool straw man
[3028.20s -> 3032.36s]  Wait, what if you had eyes that had blood coming out of them?
[3032.36s -> 3038.60s]  There were extra eyes because of 7g wireless technology. I don't think that's a straw man. I think that's a real man
[3042.76s -> 3044.60s]  Yeah, good to be home
[3044.60s -> 3055.82s]  This is dirty
[3055.82s -> 3057.82s]  What the hell is a straw man?
[3058.38s -> 3060.86s]  Ah, well welcome to the world of politic
[3061.98s -> 3065.26s]  That's just fucking god. I my heart hurts
[3066.06s -> 3083.30s]  Fuck come on. Oh my god. That was horrible. I did not
[3084.50s -> 3092.49s]  uh
[3092.49s -> 3094.49s]  Jesus christ
[3095.51s -> 3097.51s]  How do I stop that?
[3100.49s -> 3103.05s]  Can I was it it was never that loud before
[3104.57s -> 3107.00s]  Wow
[3117.19s -> 3121.19s]  Why is it getting louder? Wait, I need to try something cover your ears
[3122.33s -> 3126.97s]  Mute the stream for a second. I'm gonna do I need to see is this gonna is it going down cover?
[3127.05s -> 3133.90s]  I'm serious, please. This is a warning with an audio warning like it might lower it because that was definitely way louder
[3134.63s -> 3139.27s]  Okay, you ready? Just i'm giving you a pure warning in five seconds. Here it comes one
[3140.07s -> 3141.03s]  two
[3141.03s -> 3142.23s]  three
[3142.23s -> 3145.45s]  Four
[3145.45s -> 3147.45s]  I don't know what to do. I can never knock a wall down
[3157.32s -> 3159.32s]  I can never do anything with the walls
[3162.92s -> 3165.10s]  the master
[3165.10s -> 3167.10s]  Yeah, but if the master turns everything down
[3168.92s -> 3180.42s]  like
[3180.82s -> 3184.10s]  Oh, what were you saying again? What were you saying?
[3190.22s -> 3192.22s]  Oh my god
[3197.64s -> 3199.32s]  Okay. Well
[3199.32s -> 3202.44s]  Keep a mental note. Uh, I cannot use the hammer
[3203.29s -> 3208.57s]  And if I do I need to turn the source audio down all the way disable sound
[3226.49s -> 3232.33s]  That's unfortunate that's unfortunate that sounds like a uh, that sounds like a bug to me
[3232.97s -> 3245.82s]  It's a known bug reset the game that I have to is it saved
[3246.46s -> 3248.46s]  I have it saved right by by progress
[3254.94s -> 3262.47s]  What about my progress?
[3262.47s -> 3265.43s]  Uh, oh guys, I don't think I I think I may have lost my progress
[3269.21s -> 3271.85s]  Turn the in-game sound down in volume mixer and then it
[3279.18s -> 3281.18s]  Is that gonna do it?
[3283.11s -> 3286.94s]  Let's try it
[3286.94s -> 3289.98s]  We're on the worst timeline. Why the worst timeline?
[3297.50s -> 3300.06s]  Is it getting louder?
[3300.06s -> 3302.22s]  I don't know man. I think I might have to type into my computer
[3306.25s -> 3308.04s]  Out on steam
[3308.04s -> 3309.96s]  I got it already
[3309.96s -> 3333.78s]  Okay, let's test it last attempt and then i'm not using this device. No, ain't no
[3341.51s -> 3343.59s]  I need everybody to do me a big favor though
[3344.34s -> 3348.84s]  Like for real when there is an opportunity for me that I need to use this
[3352.68s -> 3354.84s]  I need to you guys have to spam chat
[3355.40s -> 3357.19s]  just write
[3357.19s -> 3359.19s]  Hammer sound or something. I'll forget
[3361.29s -> 3365.53s]  And I will fill somebody watching this stream's pants with shit because of that
[3368.02s -> 3372.50s]  No, I know now and I know I know I know I know but what about the other sounds let me make sure hold on
[3374.38s -> 3378.22s]  No, that's fine. What about this one? What about the paint sounds the tiling sounds?
[3379.72s -> 3381.00s]  How loud is this?
[3381.00s -> 3399.46s]  That's fine. It's just the hammer. Okay next garden, uh tool
[3401.51s -> 3403.94s]  playground and barbecue
[3404.24s -> 3406.66s]  Substrats for liquors instead of flowers
[3407.22s -> 3411.24s]  What about the barbecue my daughter grows so fast
[3411.88s -> 3414.12s]  And she is so curious about the world around her
[3414.60s -> 3417.56s]  I would love to prepare a play corner for her in the garden
[3418.04s -> 3421.40s]  It seems to me that a swing a sandpit and a rocker will be just right
[3421.88s -> 3426.92s]  Once you get started with the garden, maybe you can also plant some shrubs for me as my wife bought them for me
[3427.40s -> 3429.00s]  That'd be really nice
[3429.00s -> 3431.00s]  We've already enlarged the terrace
[3431.00s -> 3433.32s]  But now there's so much space and not much to fill it with
[3434.04s -> 3435.30s]  uh
[3435.30s -> 3439.86s]  A brugola would be useful here also a grill and a table for the whole family
[3440.34s -> 3443.30s]  Big enough to fit all of us even the grandparents when they visit us
[3443.70s -> 3445.94s]  Oh, and would you remove all these nettles too?
[3446.34s -> 3449.46s]  Those are the worst. I don't want my sweetie to get some burns from them
[3449.62s -> 3455.08s]  Okay, the the first two sentences and the last two sentences removed from this email. I'm doing a service
[3455.08s -> 3457.77s]  I'm doing a job. Tell me what you want me to do this this

[3476.47s -> 3484.49s]  Holy shit. I was too busy talking about cocks
[3486.50s -> 3494.90s]  Uh, we had 50 bucks 5 000 bits from reinville. Hopefully you're still here. Thank you reinville for the 5 000 bits 50 dollars
[3495.22s -> 3495.94s]  They say hey germa
[3495.94s -> 3500.90s]  I'm a magic the gathering artist and your streams have kept me company during long hours of painting
[3501.54s -> 3507.46s]  Really appreciate the positive space and all the goofs keep up the funny shit and know you're appreciated ps popsicle. Germa is a
[3508.10s -> 3510.26s]  Better piece of art than i've ever created
[3513.30s -> 3515.06s]  That's fucking awesome
[3515.06s -> 3516.41s]  Wow
[3516.41s -> 3520.10s]  magic the gathering artist
[3520.10s -> 3523.94s]  Yeah, i'm sure a ton of people in the chat would love to know some of the cards that you've worked on or done
[3523.94s -> 3526.87s]  That's that's really really cool
[3526.87s -> 3532.68s]  But thank you for the 50 dollars and i'm absolutely happy to keep you company while you're working on that cool shit
[3536.97s -> 3540.65s]  But thank you so much for the 50 bucks and let us know what you uh, what you're working on. That's cool
[3540.89s -> 3542.89s]  That's really really cool
[3545.34s -> 3547.78s]  All right, so
[3547.78s -> 3550.50s]  You've ruined his painting with that loud sound
[3552.50s -> 3554.10s]  Yeah, he's like
[3554.10s -> 3557.94s]  They're like working on the whatever it is like really detailed work and they hear this
[3558.74s -> 3568.62s]  Smash. Oh fucking they like move their hand and go like a big smear on it. Oh shit. I'm sorry
[3573.43s -> 3579.77s]  I would feel so bad
[3579.83s -> 3582.49s]  control z
[3582.49s -> 3587.19s]  Yeah, but what if but what if it was like a big oil painting? Is that how it works?
[3591.99s -> 3593.75s]  I need a better tool than this
[3593.75s -> 3596.47s]  This thing sucks
[3596.47s -> 3599.19s]  Can I like back up one of those log grinders?
[3600.74s -> 3604.74s]  And then no, but I would need to pull it up by hand. I mean, I want just like I need a blonde mo
[3612.78s -> 3614.78s]  Use your skill points. Do I have any new skill points?
[3615.26s -> 3626.09s]  I'll get it. Hey, let's all I have to do is start talking about it. All right
[3626.73s -> 3629.77s]  Large 2019 trimmer. That's the one I want
[3633.11s -> 3637.91s]  That's it, right? Ooh
[3637.99s -> 3639.99s]  That's a much bigger radius
[3645.62s -> 3648.30s]  Take down those weeds
[3648.30s -> 3650.30s]  Ain't ain't no corn growing on those
[3652.28s -> 3654.36s]  Because it kind of looks like corn stalks
[3657.98s -> 3668.58s]  Somebody whatever speaking of which I I would long corn
[3669.62s -> 3673.06s]  I would long maze. I don't think I would put that in a short sale
[3673.70s -> 3676.14s]  I feel like it's gonna really boom here some
[3685.11s -> 3688.31s]  All right. So now we got uh, there's still weeds over here
[3688.95s -> 3691.38s]  I'm not planting those yet. Look at all this crap
[3692.02s -> 3704.06s]  All right. Let me see the mini map
[3704.06s -> 3706.06s]  That is just I need to plant
[3707.08s -> 3709.13s]  Where's the rest of this?
[3709.13s -> 3712.17s]  Uh, it's over here. Look at all. I missed all this. What a terrible gardener
[3715.43s -> 3717.99s]  Have you has this person ever been out here before?
[3721.69s -> 3729.82s]  How long have you lived here?
[3729.82s -> 3732.78s]  Those are just gonna grow back. I know you got to get in there and rip up the roots
[3735.48s -> 3739.08s]  By hand that'll spread that poison shit on them
[3740.30s -> 3742.86s]  Get in there and rip them up get the roots
[3743.50s -> 3747.51s]  Okay, there's still weeds. Where are these last weeds?
[3750.36s -> 3758.07s]  Well, let's plant this
[3758.07s -> 3760.07s]  I would say to rip them up with your teeth

[3994.04s -> 3999.29s]  You don't have to swing on this
[3999.29s -> 4005.24s]  Dude if it were me though, I would put
[4005.88s -> 4007.88s]  I would put like something right here going up
[4008.68s -> 4011.00s]  Kind of like the head the like the hedges back here
[4011.72s -> 4015.72s]  So you could like jump you could jump out of the swing set over into the pool
[4016.97s -> 4018.97s]  I'll add a pool for free. That's fine
[4019.21s -> 4034.50s]  That was it. Oh, that was easy. Can I use it? Can I test it?

[4045.62s -> 4048.28s]  I need two of these
[4048.28s -> 4050.65s]  These are huge
[4050.65s -> 4052.65s]  No, don't ever get one this big
[4054.41s -> 4057.02s]  This is too many
[4057.02s -> 4061.74s]  Put it right in the back door. So they have to like climb through sand to go outside
[4067.16s -> 4093.38s]  That's not that big. This is really big. Okay, we're good
[4096.46s -> 4100.62s]  Too many sandboxes sandbox joke. I have a half a million dollars. I can make a joke like this

[4114.60s -> 4118.52s]  We're gonna hide back here behind the bushes and then we're gonna watch them come out out the back
[4120.82s -> 4124.98s]  And we're gonna like laugh hysterically when they like I don't what's happening here
[4125.54s -> 4127.30s]  God damn it
[4127.30s -> 4129.62s]  Damn it and they're gonna turn around and go back inside
[4130.26s -> 4145.69s]  I can make that fucking joke. I got the money
[4156.41s -> 4158.41s]  rooster spring rider
[4158.89s -> 4162.58s]  What is that?
[4162.58s -> 4164.98s]  Rooster spring rider. Oh, it's one of these
[4165.78s -> 4167.78s]  It's one of those like mcdonald's toys
[4167.86s -> 4183.03s]  This is a very you get what I mean mcdonald's. This is a mcdonald. This is from mcdonald's
[4185.40s -> 4187.56s]  Old mcdonald's play places used to have this shit
[4189.22s -> 4190.66s]  all yellow
[4190.66s -> 4197.86s]  No, that's ugly
[4197.86s -> 4204.63s]  That's all right
[4204.63s -> 4206.63s]  Your mcdonald's had to throw up corner
[4209.70s -> 4212.18s]  What is what is that? What is a throw up corner?
[4212.98s -> 4219.90s]  And then we need a cherry tree
[4224.68s -> 4226.20s]  How big does it have to be?
[4226.20s -> 4230.38s]  It can be small right? Yeah, i'm gonna put the cherry tree back here
[4239.24s -> 4245.02s]  Why do kids always throw up in there? Um, I don't think that's hard to decipher that
[4246.22s -> 4248.22s]  You eat a bunch of mcdonald's
[4248.94s -> 4252.78s]  And then you run around in a play place and slide down a bunch of slides
[4253.90s -> 4255.90s]  And get lost in like a ball pit
[4257.10s -> 4259.10s]  You that's not hard
[4259.82s -> 4264.78s]  If you eat like a mcdonald's cheeseburger if I ate a mcdonald's cheeseburger or three of them or whatever and then slid down
[4264.78s -> 4268.94s]  A slide I throw up when I get off
[4268.94s -> 4273.56s]  That looks good
[4273.56s -> 4275.74s]  Lost in a ball pit how
[4275.74s -> 4277.74s]  You guys never went
[4277.74s -> 4280.38s]  Did you guys ever do ball pits? How old are some of you guys?
[4283.32s -> 4285.88s]  Because if you were old enough to do the ball pit
[4287.10s -> 4289.11s]  At mcdonald's
[4289.11s -> 4294.07s]  You never did the thing where you dig you dig dig dig your whole body
[4294.63s -> 4296.95s]  To a point where you are underneath all of the balls
[4298.36s -> 4300.60s]  And you just like lie there for some reason
[4301.62s -> 4306.66s]  And pretend like you don't exist anymore and then like the somebody like jumps in
[4307.14s -> 4315.82s]  And crushes you
[4315.82s -> 4321.98s]  What do you mean? No one does that what you know how many times i've like bruised my shoulder and arm and leg
[4322.62s -> 4327.26s]  Because I got hulk hogan leg drop from some random kid that didn't know I was underneath them all
[4331.99s -> 4339.27s]  Still weeds somewhere. I'm looking at the mini-map. I don't see any other weeds. Do you see any other weeds?
[4339.83s -> 4345.05s]  These aren't weeds
[4345.05s -> 4350.62s]  No, those aren't weeds
[4350.62s -> 4358.38s]  Got them. There's more somewhere. There's one more this one little turd weed
[4359.18s -> 4363.59s]  You were recently in a ball pit
[4363.91s -> 4366.63s]  No, I just remember what it was like to be in a ball pit
[4374.39s -> 4378.31s]  You guys didn't have like throw the ball pit balls at each other when you were younger
[4379.19s -> 4383.86s]  That was original paintballing
[4388.63s -> 4391.83s]  That was like that was like nine your eight-year-old paintballing
[4392.63s -> 4396.66s]  And you leveled up to go paintballing
[4396.66s -> 4404.33s]  You would just like get in a corner and just have a never-ending plastic snowball fight. You guys didn't do that
[4405.05s -> 4409.34s]  All right, so I need to place
[4409.34s -> 4411.34s]  two times
[4411.66s -> 4413.18s]  Why does it say 11?
[4413.18s -> 4421.29s]  You want them on here?

[4439.02s -> 4441.02s]  I hate these. Why do you want one of these?
[4447.42s -> 4449.42s]  It's not my house. Like so why do I care?
[4453.96s -> 4455.96s]  How do you put this here without it being ugly?
[4459.59s -> 4462.15s]  Their back patio is not big enough to have this here
[4468.47s -> 4472.55s]  Well, might as well just
[4472.55s -> 4474.30s]  Whatever
[4474.30s -> 4476.92s]  Put it right in front of the door
[4476.92s -> 4478.92s]  Yeah, but what if it rains?
[4480.12s -> 4490.78s]  And it gets all up in there
[4490.78s -> 4493.10s]  Oh, you don't put uh, I thought don't you drape something on this?

[4525.32s -> 4527.32s]  Where am I supposed to put these?
[4534.71s -> 4536.71s]  You're gonna have to put them on the roof
[4537.61s -> 4539.21s]  What?

[4603.03s -> 4605.80s]  Why?
[4605.80s -> 4607.80s]  Okay. Now I need six chairs
[4621.77s -> 4623.77s]  How do you have six chairs here?
[4626.07s -> 4632.38s]  Why would you have this many?
[4632.38s -> 4636.09s]  Wait one two
[4636.09s -> 4638.81s]  One, two, three, four five six. You don't need this many
[4642.94s -> 4645.42s]  How many people do you have in your family that are coming out here?
[4651.22s -> 4653.90s]  What? Huh?
[4653.90s -> 4672.23s]  You want more? This table is not big enough to have this many chairs

[4720.36s -> 4722.52s]  All right, let's do grandma style. That's fine with me
[4724.95s -> 4726.95s]  Now this is here we go grandma
[4728.06s -> 4749.45s]  Perfect. I think we're good. No, not 100% though. What am I missing? Use the rooster
[4757.48s -> 4760.20s]  That looks all right
[4760.20s -> 4763.56s]  With like the grandma sleep pod which i'm gonna put down here
[4767.42s -> 4771.34s]  So something's going on over here that I missed weeds maybe

[4828.09s -> 4836.82s]  Now we need how many of these?
[4836.82s -> 4839.38s]  You want more than one of those? You don't have a big enough house for this
[4847.32s -> 4850.68s]  And then a table you don't have a big enough house. You can't have all this stuff
[4863.61s -> 4871.67s]  Got it. This person's fucked if it rains. That's what i'm saying. I felt like I was gonna put something up here
[4876.62s -> 4879.10s]  I thought we were gonna dread. That's why I was curious of why I had somebody
[4879.74s -> 4881.74s]  You know numbers. I thought we were gonna go
[4881.74s -> 4884.17s]  Uh tarp or something

[4909.14s -> 4913.24s]  You just have it you open up like your bank account and just look at it and go cool
[4918.39s -> 4925.83s]  All right. What was this one? Hi there mommy left for a few months
[4926.55s -> 4929.83s]  When she returns, I will tell her that the flowers unfortunately rotted
[4930.47s -> 4932.47s]  Because I watered them too often
[4933.83s -> 4939.51s]  In the meantime, you have to cut them out and plant my favorite plants quinces wine grapes, etc
[4939.99s -> 4941.75s]  You can leave the flowers that are at the front of the house
[4941.75s -> 4946.15s]  So that won't that she won't notice anything when she returns all her flowers in the backyard have to disappear
[4946.55s -> 4948.15s]  That's my spot
[4948.15s -> 4950.52s]  Hope you can do that. Can't you see ya?
[4952.58s -> 4954.58s]  What the fuck is going on here?
[4956.95s -> 4960.15s]  What kind of willy wonka chocolate room kind of shit is this?
[4966.10s -> 4967.48s]  uh
[4967.48s -> 4969.48s]  Don't get involved in this
[4970.44s -> 4973.08s]  Wait, what would what leave the ones at the front, right?
[4973.88s -> 4984.04s]  This is a nice garden. No, I don't know. No, I don't like this. This gives me anxiety
[4985.16s -> 4995.94s]  And this is like anxiety here. I don't like this. I don't it just does so I don't something about it. I don't like it
[4996.82s -> 4999.94s]  Too much just give me one giant cactus and that's it. I don't want all this other stuff
[5000.82s -> 5003.80s]  I feel like they're all looking at me
[5003.80s -> 5005.80s]  They're all like alive and shit
[5006.20s -> 5017.30s]  I'm sorry. Okay. I mean they are alive
[5018.18s -> 5020.50s]  No, just I want one huge cactus
[5021.86s -> 5025.56s]  and then a big aloe vera plant and
[5027.48s -> 5031.43s]  Maybe like a couple other cactuses. So how many anyone weeds?

[5048.84s -> 5051.58s]  Eating cactus
[5051.58s -> 5061.86s]  That shit will keep you alive man weeds weeds weeds weeds weeds. This is a nice table
[5065.46s -> 5067.62s]  Those don't even look like weeds. Those look like nice flowers
[5068.34s -> 5072.89s]  Okay, almost done with that
[5075.32s -> 5077.32s]  The hunt for weeds, you know
[5081.86s -> 5095.46s]  Right here. Is there a weed scanner? I don't have the skill point. Well, i'll get back to it. All right

[5169.37s -> 5180.36s]  I swear fucking zoomers man. I want to put this like back here
[5180.92s -> 5193.61s]  Not enough space. I'm moving this shit. There's gonna be enough space, but who cares it is a tutorial
[5195.35s -> 5199.43s]  It is just a tutorial. It is just a tutorial. It's weird to say that
[5199.91s -> 5201.91s]  It's like too many t's in that sentence

[5229.51s -> 5231.35s]  Okay, and then
[5231.35s -> 5233.51s]  That's three then three ribs
[5236.31s -> 5238.31s]  ribs r i b e s
[5238.95s -> 5241.59s]  You know three of these wait. There was a color change there
[5243.16s -> 5244.22s]  species
[5244.22s -> 5247.38s]  Uh, let's do
[5247.38s -> 5253.90s]  Let's do the red
[5253.90s -> 5259.69s]  These are gonna go in the front. Why are you saying spi?
[5261.43s -> 5263.03s]  why
[5263.03s -> 5269.62s]  Come on, I can fit one more here
[5271.30s -> 5272.78s]  right
[5272.78s -> 5274.78s]  Here somewhere. Come on
[5276.06s -> 5277.34s]  eyes
[5277.34s -> 5284.14s]  All right plant
[5284.14s -> 5287.19s]  He said the thing
[5287.19s -> 5289.19s]  Yeah, I say the thing all the time
[5289.59s -> 5294.92s]  I think i've said the word spi more in the last two months than I have in the last five years
[5306.34s -> 5309.19s]  He said it again
[5309.19s -> 5311.19s]  Just pull surprises these days
[5311.35s -> 5320.20s]  Let's plant this
[5320.20s -> 5324.87s]  You have to say it with the voice
[5325.53s -> 5327.98s]  No, I don't have to do that
[5327.98s -> 5330.92s]  No, I don't gotta do it
[5330.92s -> 5332.44s]  You can do it. You try it
[5332.44s -> 5345.14s]  I don't like the way this looks
[5345.14s -> 5353.27s]  Three then I get to plant these over here
[5353.91s -> 5356.23s]  Let's just do the big tree
[5356.23s -> 5358.23s]  First to get it out of the way
[5358.23s -> 5366.42s]  It's gonna take forever to dig. Isn't it?
[5366.42s -> 5368.42s]  How long does it take to dig a hole this big?
[5368.58s -> 5376.97s]  I don't think i've ever dug a hole like this before every time i've ever tried to dig a hole
[5377.85s -> 5380.25s]  I always get into that. Oh, yeah, i'm gonna dig a hole
[5380.89s -> 5383.21s]  You get like a not even a foot down and it's impossible
[5384.01s -> 5392.02s]  You just can't do it anymore
[5392.02s -> 5394.82s]  You like hit you hit like obsidian. It's like
[5396.50s -> 5409.22s]  You can't go
[5409.22s -> 5411.54s]  I don't know why it's weird. It's like it hardens up
[5416.04s -> 5419.88s]  Rocks and shit. Yeah, I don't know how do people dig holes without a
[5421.16s -> 5422.12s]  actual
[5422.12s -> 5423.64s]  Device to do it
[5423.64s -> 5430.36s]  I'm you guys are strong. I'm kind of a wuss
[5431.16s -> 5443.08s]  This chat is so easy to manipulate. It's crazy
[5447.24s -> 5450.44s]  I didn't say that somebody did it. I didn't say I didn't say that
[5452.25s -> 5454.25s]  Somebody said that and i'm just reading it
[5458.73s -> 5463.26s]  I said it
[5463.26s -> 5472.25s]  soil
[5472.25s -> 5475.21s]  Just say pog and we will all spam pog
[5478.06s -> 5480.06s]  Yeah, but I mean this goes both ways
[5480.14s -> 5482.41s]  because
[5482.41s -> 5487.13s]  If somebody puts a fish on the end of their comment, i'm going to read it out loud
[5487.93s -> 5488.89s]  remember
[5488.89s -> 5496.81s]  So this works both ways
[5496.81s -> 5498.81s]  We tested that theory a while ago
[5498.97s -> 5503.59s]  All right, there's still weeds over here that looks all right
[5504.63s -> 5505.83s]  ooh
[5505.83s -> 5509.59s]  Well, it's no this is bad bad placement. Just cut that one down
[5510.23s -> 5519.18s]  All right. These are the weeds
[5519.18s -> 5521.10s]  Come on weeds
[5521.10s -> 5523.90s]  Oh, there's looking how much more of this shit there is. I gotta fill the pool up
[5531.18s -> 5533.58s]  I remember having an above ground pool
[5535.32s -> 5537.32s]  And this is what you did
[5537.32s -> 5542.20s]  You had to just put the hose in there and just let it run. It took like three weeks
[5549.08s -> 5552.52s]  Now these pools come assembled and they come with water in them
[5553.08s -> 5556.20s]  A company comes to the big truck and just dumps it in there
[5563.30s -> 5568.50s]  It takes like 20 hours. Yes spread over like five days. You can't water that in a row like that
[5570.62s -> 5572.62s]  That's like that's not allowed
[5572.62s -> 5578.95s]  So you do like a couple gallons a day and it took like like two or three months
[5586.81s -> 5594.14s]  Found the weeds
[5594.14s -> 5596.14s]  Yeah, because if there was like a water ban
[5597.30s -> 5606.33s]  The water police would show up
[5606.33s -> 5608.33s]  At that point just take a bath
[5614.94s -> 5616.94s]  Are you putting
[5616.94s -> 5621.67s]  Why does it take so long? Are you putting it through a brita filter first?
[5622.63s -> 5624.63s]  There's some sick fuck that does that
[5625.11s -> 5627.67s]  You know it I don't even have to fucking pretend. That's not real
[5628.89s -> 5633.61s]  There's some like weirdo that has like purified water in their pool
[5636.09s -> 5638.81s]  They like filter it first and then they put it in the pool
[5644.78s -> 5647.42s]  In case they get thirsty. Yeah, you can just go under water and just go
[5648.38s -> 5658.18s]  It's actually kind of fucking cool
[5658.18s -> 5660.18s]  That's not that's actually pretty cool
[5660.18s -> 5665.94s]  If I've had like a fucking hundred billion dollars
[5666.50s -> 5668.98s]  I'd have a purified brita pool
[5672.52s -> 5674.36s]  and every month
[5674.36s -> 5676.60s]  I would have another pool behind it
[5677.70s -> 5684.02s]  And then we just get a giant brita filter and then filter the water every few months and dump it into the other pool
[5684.50s -> 5687.98s]  And then have that one cleaned. I think that's good with weeds
[5692.17s -> 5694.17s]  Well, wait, I just like I just cut those down
[5694.73s -> 5696.73s]  But those doesn't worry. Those are nice
[5698.60s -> 5700.34s]  Oops
[5700.34s -> 5702.50s]  All right. Now we have to do plant 10 Bacchus
[5703.22s -> 5708.44s]  Yeah, get these out of here
[5708.44s -> 5710.44s]  10 Bacchus plants
[5710.52s -> 5716.22s]  This is gonna take a million years
[5720.31s -> 5722.76s]  10 of these
[5722.76s -> 5734.79s]  three
[5735.11s -> 5746.31s]  I don't think I ever did any work like this before. Can I get some pogchamps in the chat, please for that?
[5750.47s -> 5753.19s]  Never. No, I have I have such soft
[5754.74s -> 5757.80s]  unused hands
[5757.80s -> 5761.00s]  I'm the kind of person that if I pick up a bunch of sand in my hands
[5761.40s -> 5763.40s]  I might start to bleed
[5767.37s -> 5769.37s]  They're just unused
[5771.99s -> 5773.99s]  Now we're gonna do this in waves here
[5774.63s -> 5788.14s]  You need to use them much like i'm not gonna read that one, but like all right
[5789.91s -> 5798.92s]  Settle down
[5798.92s -> 5800.92s]  Just all right. Let's just go for it
[5805.78s -> 5808.74s]  See some of you guys that have like fucking unwashed hands
[5809.82s -> 5811.32s]  You'll know
[5811.32s -> 5814.39s]  You know how long this takes to do
[5814.39s -> 5817.43s]  This should take doing this would take like three weeks
[5819.58s -> 5821.58s]  You could fill a pool in that time
[5841.61s -> 5842.97s]  Somebody just wrote
[5842.97s -> 5844.97s]  What are you talking about?
[5850.60s -> 5852.68s]  I love it
[5852.68s -> 5855.40s]  Local old man has no concept of time. Yes, I do
[5856.20s -> 5860.23s]  I was actually gonna buy a watch
[5860.23s -> 5866.23s]  And no, i'm not talking about i'm gonna do rolex. No, no, i'm gonna get like a walmart fucking like 1999 watch
[5866.87s -> 5875.54s]  An apple watch
[5875.54s -> 5881.85s]  No, i'm not gonna get an apple wash. I would wash my hands in the bathroom and I would it would break
[5891.02s -> 5894.54s]  I would seriously I would I would just forget it was on and I would wash my hands
[5894.54s -> 5896.54s]  And it would get the water would get all over it
[5902.89s -> 5905.05s]  Yeah, you have to just get one of those really really just
[5905.67s -> 5915.58s]  cheapo ones
[5915.58s -> 5917.58s]  That would happen for any other watch
[5917.82s -> 5920.38s]  yeah, I know, but there's a difference between a like
[5921.16s -> 5923.16s]  $600 watch and a
[5923.88s -> 5926.14s]  $15 watch that if you break it you just go
[5926.94s -> 5929.67s]  Ah, oh well
[5929.75s -> 5931.75s]  Instead of go. Oh, no
[5932.47s -> 5948.86s]  No
[5948.86s -> 5953.26s]  Get some water is it you could get water resistant, right? But that's too much to think about
[5954.22s -> 5959.82s]  I'm just gonna get the time tattooed on my like stomach so I can look down and like know what time it is
[5960.70s -> 5962.38s]  It's probably easier that way
[5962.38s -> 5973.51s]  I'm gonna get them all in one go here
[5985.30s -> 5987.30s]  That's how how cheap is the tattoo?
[5989.30s -> 5994.66s]  Yeah, but that okay that I make it I make that joke, but somebody somewhere has that so they can
[5995.38s -> 5996.74s]  at the bar
[5996.74s -> 5998.74s]  you know when it's like
[5999.76s -> 6001.38s]  10-28 p.m
[6001.38s -> 6005.54s]  They can lift up their fucking shirt and go 10-28 p.m
[6006.50s -> 6008.50s]  And everyone goes like what the fuck
[6009.38s -> 6011.38s]  Everyone's mouth curls into like that. Oh
[6012.62s -> 6013.96s]  and then he like
[6013.96s -> 6019.02s]  shotguns a beer
[6019.02s -> 6021.02s]  Somebody out there has that
[6021.10s -> 6027.21s]  And it's like digital clock format too. So it's even more like oh fuck off. You know what I mean?
[6039.10s -> 6041.10s]  That's literally me
[6047.24s -> 6049.74s]  That's like an interesting idea though backtracking
[6051.72s -> 6055.96s]  I can hear it. I can feel the backtrack coming out
[6058.28s -> 6064.22s]  Okay, so that's done
[6064.22s -> 6069.43s]  Nice, you didn't hear what I just said. I was like, that's like a cool idea though
[6069.99s -> 6074.20s]  Because somebody just said that I have that and then I got like scared. I was like, I hope he's not mad
[6077.32s -> 6079.40s]  Oh faster planting faster digging
[6081.38s -> 6083.38s]  Yeah faster planting I got two
[6083.70s -> 6089.67s]  Let's get the better shovel
[6089.67s -> 6094.82s]  What's the shovel look like? I want to see it. All right medium pear tree
[6096.10s -> 6097.70s]  Cherry tree
[6097.70s -> 6103.02s]  so medium
[6103.02s -> 6104.97s]  cherry tree
[6105.05s -> 6107.80s]  Need two of these
[6107.80s -> 6109.80s]  Oh, let's let's go over here
[6112.01s -> 6114.87s]  Let's put the fruit together
[6114.87s -> 6116.71s]  You know right in the back there
[6116.71s -> 6120.15s]  And the other side over here
[6120.15s -> 6124.28s]  That's not bad placement
[6124.28s -> 6126.28s]  That looks I think that looks okay
[6130.01s -> 6131.85s]  I've never played it
[6131.85s -> 6133.54s]  not once
[6133.54s -> 6138.18s]  But I was gonna make like a okay now start dota auto chess and like have them fought. I don't know
[6139.38s -> 6141.38s]  Somebody might be able to come up with something from there
[6146.90s -> 6148.90s]  They had to be over here. That's unfortunate
[6149.38s -> 6160.07s]  Oh, well, I got plenty of money
[6163.14s -> 6165.14s]  Forcing chat to make your jokes for you
[6166.02s -> 6168.18s]  I I never said I was making it. I was just like
[6170.04s -> 6173.56s]  Thinking about it. It's a good shovel
[6176.01s -> 6178.01s]  These cherry trees aren't gonna get me sun
[6178.41s -> 6197.51s]  Yeah, they are why do the cherry trees look like palm trees?
[6199.46s -> 6202.06s]  Uh, yeah, they kind of do you're right
[6204.07s -> 6205.51s]  Mod that guy
[6205.51s -> 6207.51s]  Fucking mod that guy right now
[6207.51s -> 6217.78s]  He's right
[6217.78s -> 6224.06s]  All right medium pear tree
[6224.14s -> 6228.92s]  Oh, this is cool
[6228.92s -> 6232.36s]  I'm just kidding. It's not going over there everyone's but I just saw so many people
[6233.66s -> 6237.58s]  Like grab their monitors with both hands and rip it into their face and scream
[6240.31s -> 6242.31s]  Uh, let's put it right here. It's fine
[6245.18s -> 6248.70s]  All right. We still need more the lawn two medium plum trees are gonna go one two
[6252.10s -> 6254.10s]  medium plum tree
[6254.16s -> 6256.82s]  medium
[6256.82s -> 6258.02s]  Medium
[6258.02s -> 6260.07s]  Where is it?
[6260.07s -> 6261.82s]  medium
[6261.82s -> 6268.47s]  Plum tree, what the hell?
[6268.55s -> 6270.55s]  Medium plum tree
[6275.37s -> 6287.26s]  All right, let's do it this is the most boring garden placement
[6288.26s -> 6290.26s]  What do you mean? I think it looks good
[6294.98s -> 6299.30s]  Okay, it is just kind of tree tree tree tree tree tree
[6300.42s -> 6305.46s]  It's on the edges. You're right. This is kind of a boring placement. I told you i'm not very good at this though
[6306.18s -> 6308.18s]  I'm pretty good at smashing stuff with a hammer
[6309.06s -> 6312.26s]  If you need a guy to take down a wall with a sludge hammer with anger
[6312.82s -> 6315.83s]  Just leave it to me. I'll take care of that
[6316.90s -> 6318.98s]  If you want loud sounds I can make those
[6319.88s -> 6325.26s]  With my mouth did I get the job?
[6325.90s -> 6333.96s]  Okay, so that's still weeds
[6341.11s -> 6345.83s]  Why does it sound like static?
[6345.83s -> 6350.92s]  I don't know
[6350.92s -> 6353.10s]  I have absolutely
[6353.18s -> 6355.18s]  Idea. No, that's not how it works
[6356.86s -> 6360.44s]  It doesn't just stop
[6360.44s -> 6363.61s]  I seriously
[6363.61s -> 6367.18s]  everybody would just
[6367.18s -> 6369.93s]  It gets to a point when that the
[6370.01s -> 6372.33s]  Power of the devices that you power in your house
[6372.89s -> 6374.89s]  So if you have two sockets
[6375.61s -> 6380.15s]  Use the
[6380.15s -> 6395.59s]  Don't put anything in there. Did you guys get that nice?
[6396.47s -> 6398.47s]  All right. Now let's like fucking stomp
[6401.32s -> 6403.32s]  With like big boots on. All right. So we good
[6404.04s -> 6406.04s]  No, I still need to move weeds
[6409.29s -> 6411.29s]  Pool weeds not cool
[6420.18s -> 6421.70s]  Where are they?
[6421.70s -> 6425.86s]  It's getting dark out. This task is taking me all day to complete lawn
[6426.42s -> 6436.12s]  All right, I got the lawn mode still weed somewhere
[6442.97s -> 6446.04s]  Hmm. Anybody see weeds?
[6446.60s -> 6448.60s]  Ah, no, it doesn't not weeds
[6449.61s -> 6457.22s]  Where are these weeds could be flowers though. I can't tell I don't see any
[6461.37s -> 6463.05s]  Don't ignore us
[6463.05s -> 6465.94s]  What do you want about?
[6465.94s -> 6468.50s]  This whole job was two thousand dollars. What a piece of crap
[6470.08s -> 6472.52s]  99 percent
[6472.54s -> 6473.42s]  Oh
[6473.42s -> 6475.98s]  Just like cox's uptime in quotes
[6482.04s -> 6486.25s]  That's actually what they say
[6486.25s -> 6487.77s]  All right. Um
[6487.77s -> 6489.45s]  I got a lot of bugs in my house
[6489.45s -> 6492.49s]  No, i'm leaving it like that. Oh, yeah that we destroy these walls
[6498.15s -> 6502.81s]  No, I like this stuff. I'm keeping it. All right, there might be time too. I think we know what we're doing here
[6504.98s -> 6506.50s]  one little thing to come
[6506.50s -> 6510.82s]  Complete my part of heaven. I guess this is what is there any other tools that I have not figured out?
[6515.86s -> 6520.18s]  Buy the home alone house. Well, not yet. Hold on. I need to make sure there's any tools that I can use
[6520.74s -> 6524.98s]  Why is the music so the music's not scary?
[6528.36s -> 6530.68s]  Why is the music scary? What are you talking about?
[6531.16s -> 6535.93s]  I should be back home by the end of the week
[6535.93s -> 6539.45s]  I just need some rest when I get back and I think that the mess in my garden might make me nervous
[6540.25s -> 6541.29s]  See
[6541.29s -> 6546.09s]  You I don't even have this garden and it's fucking already making this person like nervous and have anxiety
[6548.25s -> 6551.45s]  I feel the same way. I want to hire your company again to put my garden or to own

[6677.88s -> 6685.64s]  This thing sucks
[6686.28s -> 6690.84s]  You're using a corner edger to mow an entire one
[6692.89s -> 6697.77s]  Imagine looking out the window and seeing this sorry ass guy out here just mowing with an edger
[6707.18s -> 6709.42s]  I don't have access to a lawnmower
[6713.03s -> 6728.76s]  Coming soon. I don't think there is a lawnmower. It's not in the game yet
[6734.60s -> 6744.12s]  Oh god and flipper. Am I going to e3 this year? I I don't know
[6746.95s -> 6749.03s]  Didn't everybody back out of e3?
[6749.75s -> 6754.58s]  Like everybody backed out of that one dude's birthday party
[6755.06s -> 6761.06s]  You passed out invitations to everybody and like one of the cool kids isn't going
[6761.62s -> 6765.62s]  So then all of a sudden you get like ah, I mean, I can't go. I'm sick
[6767.85s -> 6771.29s]  And then you end up with just like the your two or three close friends that go
[6779.77s -> 6783.29s]  And you rented out the whole laser tag arena. It was gonna be really cool
[6785.75s -> 6787.75s]  You have this vision in your mind
[6788.49s -> 6791.45s]  Of two teams of like 15 people on each team
[6799.53s -> 6801.53s]  Not the laser tag again
[6805.83s -> 6807.99s]  That just kind of reminds me. Does anybody else do this?
[6809.11s -> 6809.99s]  where
[6809.99s -> 6813.83s]  So you've like a trip or something that you've like wanted to do or planned for a long time
[6813.91s -> 6815.51s]  You have all these like ideas of how it's gonna go
[6815.51s -> 6817.99s]  Like it would like a water park or like disney world or something
[6819.29s -> 6824.33s]  And you go you have you think about like weeks in advance like all this shit that you're gonna do
[6824.57s -> 6830.09s]  And how much fucking fun it's going to be and how amazing you're gonna try that and you're gonna try that that
[6830.09s -> 6835.77s]  This restaurant seems cool. We'll try that one and then you get there and you do like two things and you're like, this is this stupid
[6836.41s -> 6842.92s]  this sucks
[6842.92s -> 6844.76s]  Or like, uh, this is
[6844.76s -> 6846.76s]  It's like okay, I guess
[6847.16s -> 6851.48s]  And you've spent weeks before man. I go like we're gonna try this is gonna be so awesome
[6851.56s -> 6853.56s]  And you have the thing you're like, oh this is
[6854.49s -> 6863.42s]  Yeah, that's all right
[6863.42s -> 6866.94s]  The most fun just kind of happens when you just don't even you accidentally have it
[6868.55s -> 6870.79s]  it's like you go to the disney world and
[6871.67s -> 6875.51s]  Instead of the ride that you wanted to ride and getting off it and being like that was fun
[6876.07s -> 6880.71s]  No, no, there's like a clown in the street. That's like juggling and you love it and you're like, this is fucking great
[6881.03s -> 6883.03s]  That's the best thing i've ever seen in my entire life
[6883.75s -> 6901.32s]  It's those moments. That's why I don't have a schedule and I and I don't stream that much
[6906.01s -> 6908.25s]  He's gonna tie it back into streams
[6911.13s -> 6912.01s]  You know
[6912.01s -> 6925.96s]  That makes sense doesn't it? It just makes sense to me. This amusement park sucks

[7225.99s -> 7231.74s]  Can I like I think I might have been wrong
[7233.14s -> 7235.14s]  Maybe it's possible but you know
[7235.54s -> 7239.67s]  I think so though
[7239.67s -> 7246.12s]  I mean I was the lead in my school play. How would I ever be fucking wrong about anything?
[7252.17s -> 7254.17s]  But one time I threw
[7254.25s -> 7255.61s]  a pass
[7255.61s -> 7258.01s]  A 40 yard pass
[7258.01s -> 7260.01s]  How the fuck could I ever be wrong?
[7263.99s -> 7265.99s]  I did I mean I did that once
[7266.15s -> 7286.71s]  I got it all I did it wait. I didn't get this part. There's one little strip here
[7287.59s -> 7294.06s]  All right. That's good
[7294.06s -> 7296.06s]  That's good. Look at that

[7445.26s -> 7447.29s]  Right
[7447.29s -> 7450.25s]  You spent that much time writing that but you didn't mow your whole lawn
[7455.10s -> 7458.54s]  I feel like this is the kind of person that would have like 40 bumper stickers
[7468.49s -> 7473.18s]  right
[7473.18s -> 7475.18s]  So, okay. I was partially wrong
[7476.78s -> 7479.21s]  You want to know why?
[7479.21s -> 7484.49s]  Here's why you were partially wrong because if i'm putting that's how i'm gonna spin it check this out ready
[7484.89s -> 7486.89s]  If i'm putting straight down
[7486.89s -> 7492.25s]  Like this. Yes, it gets it all but if I have it up a little it's not cutting and I didn't know that
[7492.65s -> 7494.89s]  I I thought it had it didn't matter what the angle was
[7495.45s -> 7497.85s]  So you were partially wrong and I was always right
[7510.15s -> 7513.35s]  All right. I think it's time to buy a house. I think I know I know what I know what to do

[7662.62s -> 7664.62s]  Oh shit, you have to get every little piece
[7670.73s -> 7672.73s]  Take a mental note of what this looks like
[7672.81s -> 7674.26s]  Because it'll be probably
[7674.26s -> 7675.38s]  um
[7675.38s -> 7679.30s]  I'm trying to think this is how it'll be like at least
[7680.16s -> 7682.26s]  32 to 35 percent better
[7682.90s -> 7686.18s]  When i'm done take a mental note of what you see right here. I put away the tool
[7688.23s -> 7690.23s]  Screenshot that and then that
[7691.22s -> 7693.22s]  And this and then screenshot this
[7693.86s -> 7697.94s]  Get a screenshot of this too because I want you to compile. This is like a big collage screenshot that
[7698.50s -> 7700.50s]  Get a close-up of that one screenshot right now

[7757.85s -> 7760.65s]  He was coming to fight me. Did you see he was like trying to bite me in the legs?
[7766.09s -> 7767.80s]  I yeah
[7767.80s -> 7769.32s]  What a wuss

[7782.46s -> 7785.34s]  I I okay. Look, I can't I can't imagine
[7786.44s -> 7789.48s]  If you this is like your bedroom right here, right or like right here
[7790.36s -> 7794.28s]  Can you imagine just throwing cans of soda out your open window?
[7797.48s -> 7800.52s]  What are you doing?
[7800.52s -> 7804.92s]  The just don't you have a trash can just you open the windows open and you're just like
[7806.20s -> 7820.54s]  Throw it out the window
[7820.62s -> 7822.62s]  If I ever threw a can on the ground
[7823.94s -> 7825.94s]  It would cause me physical pain
[7828.57s -> 7830.41s]  Not only be not only
[7830.41s -> 7831.61s]  because
[7831.61s -> 7834.49s]  Of the ability to scrape the dna off of the mouth part
[7835.45s -> 7837.45s]  I'm not you know, fuck that
[7837.85s -> 7840.97s]  Not only being able to cotton swab the top of that and fucking get me
[7847.19s -> 7851.58s]  But that it's it's rude and bad and you think i'm making that up. Oh look at question marks
[7851.66s -> 7854.78s]  What the fuck is this weirdo streamer talking about? There was somebody
[7855.42s -> 7856.30s]  That
[7856.30s -> 7860.22s]  Found like gum all over the ground and shit and picked up random stuff
[7861.02s -> 7868.89s]  And did dna testing on it and made people out of it. They like went and got gum
[7869.61s -> 7873.85s]  And like tested it and made what they think the person looked like
[7874.65s -> 7878.71s]  I swear to god, this is real
[7878.71s -> 7881.99s]  They did like a police sketch of these of what the people looked like
[7884.97s -> 7894.25s]  That is true. Yes, it is
[7894.25s -> 7897.77s]  No, i'm not having an episode. This is what do you mean? What about having an episode?
[7899.64s -> 7900.68s]  No, no, no
[7900.68s -> 7904.12s]  You know, i'm not saying like they made a human out of like finding gum in the trash
[7904.12s -> 7907.80s]  i'm saying that somebody did like a scientific research thing where they took
[7908.52s -> 7910.52s]  samples from like stuff in the trash
[7911.24s -> 7912.52s]  and gum
[7912.52s -> 7919.80s]  That was chewed up underneath like seats and shit and they did a dna like genetic code of what that person may look like
[7922.49s -> 7924.49s]  What if you're on there? What if that's you?
[7930.07s -> 7933.61s]  That's so interesting
[7933.61s -> 7938.28s]  That cloning experience. I remember reading about that like years ago
[7941.43s -> 7946.07s]  I didn't say what clone? No, I didn't say cloning. I said that there's like that like that's research
[7953.58s -> 7957.34s]  We already know what you look like. No, you don't you didn't go like find gum
[7966.46s -> 7971.66s]  That's an episode of black mirrors. No, no, this is like actual scientific research
[7972.54s -> 7980.17s]  Hold on stay right there
[7980.17s -> 7998.90s]  Nobody move. Yeah, it's for real
[8005.37s -> 8019.80s]  Just this shit is science guys. It's the pre-recorded joke
[8022.28s -> 8023.72s]  Sight your source
[8023.72s -> 8027.64s]  I think the american institute of uh collegiate scientific discovery
[8029.19s -> 8033.43s]  Yes, I know that sounds like a shell company for like a bit of money like launder money
[8045.59s -> 8047.59s]  mla format
[8051.91s -> 8055.75s]  The article and or researcher. All right, do I hold let me see if I can find this
[8056.31s -> 8058.31s]  I remember this was so fascinating
[8079.18s -> 8080.62s]  I got it
[8080.62s -> 8084.48s]  Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. It's from the smithsonian
[8085.36s -> 8088.96s]  Are you gonna are you gonna not say that the smithsonian does like something interesting?
[8096.60s -> 8099.87s]  Yeah, like from cigarette butts
[8101.16s -> 8110.96s]  And they can make map out of face. This is me smithsonian smithsonian mag
[8111.60s -> 8114.42s]  Azine so this is this from the smithsonian.com
[8118.04s -> 8124.11s]  All you have to do. I'm not gonna like break the smithsonian website
[8124.75s -> 8130.27s]  If you want to figure out for yourself, you just have to type in pulling dna from gum what they look like
[8130.75s -> 8132.75s]  Into google and you'll find it
[8132.83s -> 8133.95s]  Thanks
[8133.95s -> 8141.64s]  Always wrong though, right? What does it say in my front line?
[8142.78s -> 8145.45s]  What does it say in my front line?
[8145.45s -> 8147.05s]  This is actual research
[8147.05s -> 8160.11s]  It's the god damn smithsonian
[8168.36s -> 8170.44s]  Use it as a retort for everything
[8172.19s -> 8185.24s]  Always right. How do we even get to like the smithsonian like research?
[8188.81s -> 8192.01s]  I work for the smithsonian. Thanks for giving us the shout out. Yeah, it's fucking great
[8193.03s -> 8194.17s]  Absolutely
[8194.17s -> 8197.37s]  Really interesting really cool research for real like it's really cool shit
[8198.33s -> 8207.07s]  Wait, didn't I start by saying that I was terrified of that? No, i'm not that was it's cool shit. What?
[8207.79s -> 8220.03s]  But imagine if you like saw your face
[8224.99s -> 8246.68s]  I do actually think it's pretty cool though for real. Well bullshit. I'd rather not see my face
[8247.48s -> 8253.31s]  Well, of course, of course we shout out science on this channel. It's very interesting stuff
[8261.24s -> 8263.24s]  I don't leave hair. Yes, you do
[8264.04s -> 8270.41s]  What are you talking about? You know, you you know, you shed like 150 hairs a day. What do you mean?
[8273.87s -> 8275.87s]  If you have a head of hair
[8275.95s -> 8278.32s]  You shed 150 hairs a day
[8278.56s -> 8284.57s]  Your hair is everywhere
[8284.57s -> 8286.57s]  Um i'm sputter walking again
[8286.89s -> 8292.08s]  There's a space x launch tonight. That's nice
[8298.38s -> 8301.74s]  All right. I'm i'm kind of just like talking I need to like focus
[8304.08s -> 8306.08s]  That's a free haircut every single day. That's true
[8306.88s -> 8324.60s]  How do they know it's my hair nerd?
[8325.71s -> 8330.99s]  Well, if science ever gets to a point where they can genetically take your entire code from that hair
[8331.95s -> 8333.47s]  They'll be able to know
[8333.55s -> 8337.79s]  That yeah, you ordered four big macs last night. You were in line
[8338.51s -> 8341.23s]  At that mcdonald's and you got four big macs
[8341.79s -> 8350.78s]  You can't hide that anymore
[8350.78s -> 8354.30s]  They'll have like some big mac juice saliva and you
[8355.28s -> 8356.24s]  Like that
[8356.24s -> 8358.24s]  dripped out onto the ground
[8358.62s -> 8362.54s]  And they'll be able to tell the quantity of big macs that you ate because of the like enzymes in your saliva
[8363.26s -> 8365.26s]  Give it like another 500 years
[8369.32s -> 8376.46s]  Did they get me?
[8376.46s -> 8378.62s]  Did they get me?
[8378.62s -> 8396.41s]  Uh-oh, we were all right for a little while. I think we're good quantity of big macs
[8396.41s -> 8398.41s]  How many big macs do you eat? Well, it depends
[8399.34s -> 8402.54s]  It I mean it depends on how hungry I am. What's the scenario my
[8404.41s -> 8406.41s]  as I haven't been like
[8406.41s -> 8411.64s]  Streaming or whatever. Oh, no, my stream is sputter walking
[8413.20s -> 8415.52s]  Yeah, it was kind of inevitable because they didn't do anything
[8416.70s -> 8421.18s]  And i'm I was told that maybe as of we'd have a static ip later today
[8421.66s -> 8423.66s]  Oh, I think it's actually to zero
[8424.06s -> 8436.06s]  Holy shit, that was bad
[8436.06s -> 8437.74s]  Hold on. Let me send a text
[8437.74s -> 8446.04s]  Am I good?
[8446.04s -> 8448.76s]  I'm supposed to i'm supposed to text somebody when it's like really bad
[8459.69s -> 8461.37s]  Hold on. Give me a second
[8461.37s -> 8466.30s]  Give me one second
[8466.30s -> 8476.68s]  I would call this bad. I would call this
[8478.32s -> 8481.36s]  Not good
[8481.36s -> 8486.56s]  Hmm, is it worth I I feel like I got my hand on like the emergency line and I feel like I
[8486.80s -> 8488.80s]  I don't want to pick it up and be like help me, please
[8489.28s -> 8491.28s]  And they're like there's nothing there. Oh
[8491.68s -> 8493.28s]  Yeah, I don't want to be like the
[8493.28s -> 8498.99s]  The boy who crawled uh cried frames do we got a raid?
[8501.68s -> 8508.81s]  Oh shit, we do have a raid. Hello everybody. Hopefully we stay connected to the internet
[8511.88s -> 8513.80s]  uh, that's from uh
[8513.80s -> 8515.64s]  robaz
[8515.64s -> 8521.98s]  robaz
[8521.98s -> 8523.98s]  robaz robaz
[8533.74s -> 8541.20s]  Now I know I know who robaz is but thank you so much
[8543.16s -> 8546.12s]  That that's you. That's an old that's an old youtuber
[8549.90s -> 8551.74s]  the king of um
[8551.74s -> 8556.04s]  king of the castle no king of uh, what the
[8556.68s -> 8565.79s]  He's an old youtube
[8565.79s -> 8572.57s]  Robaz has been around for a long time, but thank you. Welcome everybody. Hopefully we stay on connected
[8573.13s -> 8592.48s]  Why am I not cutting this? Ah, yes the castle, uh, but yeah, we're playing house flipper currently fighting the internet
[8592.48s -> 8595.52s]  Hopefully you had a good stream robaz
[8595.52s -> 8599.55s]  Thank you so much for the raid
[8599.55s -> 8607.98s]  What were you streaming? What were you doing? He beat getting over it. Are you serious?
[8611.12s -> 8623.79s]  That's impossible
[8623.79s -> 8630.00s]  Wow, congratulations. That's insane
[8630.00s -> 8633.92s]  All right, I think it's time to say I gotta say I got I gotta like pick up the emergency phone line here
[8638.64s -> 8640.64s]  I'm going for the emergency phone line
[8640.64s -> 8659.92s]  Wish me luck. Let's see. Hold on
[8660.80s -> 8671.61s]  I didn't know how long this stream was gonna be and I hope we can actually keep it going for like at least a little
[8671.61s -> 8673.29s]  while longer
[8673.29s -> 8679.95s]  All right. I got my I got my hand on the button. I have a text written out and i'm ready to like press the button
[8686.56s -> 8697.42s]  I sent it. I sent it. I pressed it. It's been done
[8706.36s -> 8708.52s]  Let's see. Let's see if anything happens
[8719.42s -> 8721.42s]  I just got a text message
[8722.44s -> 8724.52s]  Well, hey, come on, give me a hand here
[8730.41s -> 8735.05s]  No, i'll be right back. I'm calling. I got i'm going for it. I'm gonna i'm no text is not fast enough
[8735.05s -> 8736.25s]  I gotta do it now
[8736.25s -> 8739.61s]  I'll be right back. I'm calling i'll be right back
[8833.37s -> 8837.29s]  Uh, that would happen wouldn't it? Oh god damn it
[8840.25s -> 8841.93s]  No
[8841.93s -> 8844.41s]  Uh, so I i've tried to call
[8847.10s -> 8849.82s]  Let me try to catch it call me when something happens
[8851.42s -> 8856.28s]  The phone is off
[8856.28s -> 8858.28s]  It goes right to voice bill
[8858.52s -> 8862.36s]  And they didn't get the text either because it doesn't say delivered their phone is off
[8864.59s -> 8869.63s]  No, it's not they're not closed. This is a direct line to somebody. This is this is somebody's like phone number
[8877.76s -> 8879.76s]  No, this is the opportunity
[8880.72s -> 8881.92s]  No
[8881.92s -> 8883.92s]  Charge your phone. What?
[8892.03s -> 8895.47s]  They called you no no, but that no no that wasn't them
[8897.15s -> 8899.48s]  No, they didn't that wasn't them
[8899.48s -> 8901.96s]  I i recognize that that was a different number
[8902.76s -> 8907.08s]  I have this person in my phone as like the cox guy and that's not who it was
[8909.77s -> 8915.28s]  Oh, well, it's okay
[8915.28s -> 8916.96s]  Uh, let's do
[8916.96s -> 8920.67s]  Let's do this
[8920.67s -> 8923.50s]  And faster digging
[8923.50s -> 8927.50s]  But after all I just wanted to make sure I clearly state uh everyone that came over from
[8928.06s -> 8930.06s]  Uh robaz's channel
[8931.87s -> 8934.11s]  Uh, I kind of was in the middle of this bullshit. So
[8935.88s -> 8938.20s]  Thank you again for coming out and again. Thanks for the raid
[8939.96s -> 8941.48s]  I really appreciate it
[8941.48s -> 8947.48s]  Just want to make sure I got that out
[8947.48s -> 8951.00s]  Because I didn't know if we were dropping or not in the middle of me talking about it
[8951.72s -> 8956.81s]  I'm saying i've got i've got an accent. I can't help it
[8964.86s -> 8966.86s]  I don't think this is any of the stream
[8968.88s -> 8970.88s]  No, we're good. It's all right. We'll be fine
[8972.89s -> 8974.89s]  Just everyone uh
[8975.56s -> 8981.80s]  Everybody just at the same time close your eyes and just think about how just think good thoughts here
[8998.46s -> 9003.42s]  The good thoughts aren't working here, but if we all use our like brain power
[9003.74s -> 9015.37s]  We can use our own 5g 6g network to be able to fix this. Does everybody think like give
[9016.01s -> 9020.57s]  Me better internet right now and like now our brains have electromagnetic, uh currents to them
[9021.29s -> 9028.35s]  We're gonna make our own like 7g network into this house
[9029.15s -> 9035.23s]  There's so much dead grass
[9035.79s -> 9049.68s]  I think it worked
[9049.68s -> 9055.28s]  Okay now like like a thousand of you just dedicate yourselves to to doing the brain power thing
[9055.84s -> 9063.69s]  And we should be fine. I need to get these weeds
[9066.91s -> 9067.87s]  No
[9067.87s -> 9076.51s]  Uh, you don't have to do that. I'm kidding. I think it passed
[9079.63s -> 9081.63s]  Yeah, I think we're fine
[9083.77s -> 9086.36s]  You guys did it
[9086.36s -> 9089.32s]  You guys you guys did it you actually did it
[9089.96s -> 9107.85s]  I'm, so proud of you guys
[9107.85s -> 9114.94s]  Maybe maybe he got the text hopefully I didn't I hope he wasn't eating like a pizza or something
[9115.66s -> 9118.09s]  Because if you're eating pizza that your hands
[9118.41s -> 9122.57s]  You can't really do anything. You're like a greasy hands and you can't really help and he's probably eating a pizza
[9122.57s -> 9133.32s]  And I didn't want to like bother him
[9133.32s -> 9135.96s]  If you had like a deep dish pizza, would you want someone to like text you?
[9136.84s -> 9139.77s]  No, you put your phone on silent until you're done
[9140.94s -> 9145.66s]  And you're gonna eat the whole fucking thing. That's fine. Don't tell that and then people are gonna be like
[9145.82s -> 9147.82s]  You ate a whole pizza. Don't worry. Don't listen to them
[9148.38s -> 9159.90s]  That's okay
[9159.90s -> 9168.62s]  It's not healthy. I know look at all this grass
[9169.98s -> 9172.06s]  I'm gonna shape this place up though. Just you wait
[9172.70s -> 9180.64s]  I want that lawnmower though
[9180.72s -> 9187.66s]  Can I not get the lawnmower?
[9187.66s -> 9189.66s]  I wish jerma would text me
[9189.82s -> 9192.00s]  No, you don't want me to text you
[9192.00s -> 9195.00s]  It'd be a bunch of nonsense
[9195.00s -> 9201.28s]  All right this house
[9201.28s -> 9203.84s]  Do the weeds grow back after a certain amount of time?
[9209.16s -> 9221.56s]  I feel like they probably do
[9221.56s -> 9223.64s]  Come on get in there right in the middle. I'll get it later
[9224.78s -> 9226.14s]  All right
[9226.14s -> 9228.57s]  So far so good
[9228.57s -> 9232.28s]  Looking pretty damn good
[9232.36s -> 9234.04s]  Oh
[9234.04s -> 9240.51s]  A little bit on the edge here. I'll get it. I can't get it
[9241.47s -> 9242.91s]  No, I cannot get that
[9242.91s -> 9249.71s]  Yes, I can
[9249.71s -> 9252.35s]  Gotta get the roots or the weeds will never go away
[9254.09s -> 9256.41s]  I don't think this game is going that deep
[9257.13s -> 9260.33s]  The house is a piece of crap though
[9265.04s -> 9268.16s]  So many weeds and so much grass
[9276.64s -> 9278.72s]  With the yeah, you know the house has to be renovated too
[9283.47s -> 9286.43s]  All right. What if I just do the part again if I just do the part that people see
[9287.15s -> 9289.64s]  Who cares, right?
[9289.64s -> 9292.44s]  No one's gonna look in this bush and see there's grass in there
[9294.11s -> 9298.99s]  Who's gonna do that?
[9298.99s -> 9300.99s]  That's being lazy. Yeah, but
[9302.28s -> 9303.88s]  You don't have to do it all
[9303.88s -> 9311.24s]  Come on get it almost done
[9313.36s -> 9320.06s]  He's being a lazy boy all this crap. That's what it is. It's crap
[9321.00s -> 9328.16s]  Look at all this crap
[9328.16s -> 9329.28s]  um
[9329.28s -> 9331.28s]  Get this chunk out of here
[9331.44s -> 9334.38s]  Replace it with some cactuses
[9334.38s -> 9342.59s]  I want some light
[9342.59s -> 9344.67s]  You're gonna make a house with a dad in the bushes
[9345.63s -> 9354.09s]  I have to play the brain. I'm not gonna play the brain power song
[9355.69s -> 9358.33s]  No
[9358.33s -> 9360.33s]  No brain power
[9362.75s -> 9364.75s]  I don't want to overdo it because you'll overload it
[9365.39s -> 9370.44s]  Can it be daylight, please?
[9370.84s -> 9372.84s]  So I can get on with this project
[9373.16s -> 9384.04s]  Need more power. I need to zoom in here with my seat. There we go
[9385.00s -> 9388.80s]  Let's open the door and see what we got working with in the inside
[9389.52s -> 9395.56s]  I need lights
[9395.56s -> 9397.93s]  ugly
[9397.93s -> 9400.49s]  Revolting what's with the rooms in this house?
[9401.13s -> 9410.49s]  Like give me some light
[9410.49s -> 9413.76s]  Uh, it doesn't matter
[9414.32s -> 9424.08s]  Oh just put i'm gonna replace him, but let's just buy a bunch
[9425.12s -> 9430.48s]  Can I put these outside?
[9430.48s -> 9432.48s]  I need the light out here temporarily
[9436.01s -> 9446.03s]  How do I turn these on I need the lights on the outside
[9446.83s -> 9453.68s]  All right. Here we go
[9453.68s -> 9455.08s]  What?
[9455.08s -> 9460.48s]  Why?
[9460.48s -> 9478.89s]  That doesn't control that how is it possible? Well, that's annoying. I forgot I had a flashlight. Thank you for the tip
[9485.85s -> 9489.56s]  No one's gonna see that. All right. What about I gotta clean this house up
[9490.75s -> 9493.47s]  I'm gonna be rolling out the uh, green carpet here
[9494.91s -> 9498.03s]  Make sure I got enough. You don't get this all just get rid of all of it
[9499.15s -> 9501.15s]  Yeah, fuck that get out of here
[9502.68s -> 9504.44s]  Put it in myself
[9504.44s -> 9512.54s]  This looks like left for dead. It kind of does
[9513.50s -> 9514.86s]  You are right
[9514.86s -> 9524.46s]  Give me that last little thing there. Come on
[9525.18s -> 9531.10s]  This game is seriously such you could become such a perfectionist
[9537.48s -> 9539.88s]  How is he still mowing the fucking lawn?
[9540.68s -> 9542.76s]  Because i'm doing it with a weed whacker
[9545.50s -> 9557.53s]  It would take this long
[9557.53s -> 9562.27s]  All right a wild
[9563.08s -> 9564.20s]  animal
[9564.20s -> 9570.60s]  At this edge
[9570.60s -> 9572.60s]  Ah, all right. Nice
[9573.72s -> 9575.72s]  I hope you had those screenshots from before ready
[9576.28s -> 9579.64s]  Because i'm gonna need them
[9579.64s -> 9582.08s]  Well, not yet, but in like probably like an hour
[9587.79s -> 9590.11s]  You mowing the lawn with a weed whacker at 3 a.m
[9592.56s -> 9595.44s]  Yeah, i'm probably on something really strong
[9596.00s -> 9611.32s]  I'm not sure what though
[9611.32s -> 9613.32s]  Watch out for the mole
[9613.32s -> 9626.38s]  I have to work in the morning. Why are you doing this?
[9628.78s -> 9631.90s]  Just just just 20 minutes, man. I got this
[9632.62s -> 9639.45s]  Hey, do you care if I play some music?
[9639.45s -> 9643.24s]  Anybody care if I play music?
[9643.24s -> 9657.60s]  Play some music
[9657.60s -> 9659.15s]  One of these
[9659.15s -> 9689.31s]  We need a clean slate because I want to get all I can put my own stuff in here. There we go
[9693.13s -> 9699.55s]  Oh, by the way, I forgot to say this the uh, the the one of the cocks maintenance like technician people
[9700.75s -> 9704.67s]  They told me that the reason why we're having problems is because of the kids playing call of duty
[9706.89s -> 9708.41s]  I'm not making that up
[9708.41s -> 9719.40s]  I swear to god
[9719.40s -> 9721.40s]  It's those kids playing call of duty
[9723.72s -> 9726.40s]  Oh
[9726.40s -> 9729.05s]  All right
[9729.05s -> 9731.05s]  You're one of those kids
[9732.33s -> 9735.37s]  I'm playing ultra call of duty. I'm playing call of duty
[9736.27s -> 9738.27s]  on like 30 xboxes
[9755.80s -> 9764.78s]  Nobody even plays black ops anymore. It's those damn video games clogging up the toilet
[9768.40s -> 9769.84s]  Hey, okay
[9769.84s -> 9771.04s]  You in there?
[9771.04s -> 9772.00s]  Yeah
[9772.00s -> 9774.41s]  What are you doing there for so long?
[9774.41s -> 9776.57s]  Nothing just I have to go to the bathroom
[9777.79s -> 9779.79s]  Get off a fucking call of duty
[9779.79s -> 9780.83s]  Come on
[9780.83s -> 9795.96s]  We gotta go to church mom said it's my turn to play
[9796.36s -> 9801.77s]  All right, but let's just let's just say that is the case, right? That's like let's say that's the truth
[9802.25s -> 9804.01s]  And that's really what's happening
[9804.01s -> 9806.89s]  What the fuck are you supposed to do?
[9808.09s -> 9810.06s]  What?
[9810.06s -> 9812.38s]  Too many video games too many internet connections too many
[9813.74s -> 9825.80s]  All right
[9825.80s -> 9827.80s]  Cock said it's my turn to use the internet
[9835.58s -> 9837.58s]  Don't queue our spier right now
[9839.69s -> 9841.13s]  All right
[9841.13s -> 9843.13s]  I think we are clean
[9858.06s -> 9866.81s]  Uh time to become like an irl streamer carrying on one of those like ghostbusters internet backpacks
[9867.37s -> 9883.31s]  Where's the broccoli video?
[9884.40s -> 9886.40s]  I got a big bigger fish to fry at this point
[9890.19s -> 9895.47s]  Okay, so we're good. Let's take take care of the uh, although outside is good
[9895.63s -> 9897.63s]  I'm gonna do a line. I don't even know what I want to do
[9898.35s -> 9903.71s]  We're gonna replace this grass. First of all, that's really important
[9907.13s -> 9909.77s]  That sounded like the weed wacker, but I can assure you it wasn't
[9910.33s -> 9920.11s]  My brother used to work at our local isp with nodes specifically
[9920.11s -> 9925.07s]  And he told me a while ago that 99% of the time they overload the nodes in higher resonance real areas
[9925.39s -> 9927.39s]  Most ips just oh, yeah. No, it's ridiculous
[9929.02s -> 9931.18s]  They don't they they don't give a fuck
[9932.41s -> 9937.13s]  See what they they just load as many customers on as many packages as they can
[9937.69s -> 9941.21s]  Until you have like thousands of people on one node
[9942.73s -> 9944.81s]  And then it doesn't work as good anymore
[9946.73s -> 9951.53s]  But here's the real awful part about this, right? I'm gonna give you the real reality. Don't use that
[9953.05s -> 9956.09s]  Um, most people do not use the internet
[9956.73s -> 9958.09s]  like this
[9958.09s -> 9959.95s]  right
[9959.95s -> 9962.27s]  most households do not have
[9963.23s -> 9965.87s]  A connection that needs to be constantly stable
[9969.08s -> 9971.64s]  like six thousand up
[9972.44s -> 9975.24s]  For three four five six seven eight hours, right?
[9976.52s -> 9982.36s]  So they can get away with all this dog shit because for the most part most people don't even know it's happening
[9983.80s -> 9991.69s]  The only reason why we know in this area that this is happening is because like i'm streaming right now. So it
[9992.49s -> 9996.65s]  You you you you're not gonna be like to convince very many people like hey, let me go door to door
[9996.65s -> 9998.65s]  Hey, we're gonna replace that node
[9998.73s -> 10002.24s]  What are you talking about? My internet's fine. I go
[10003.42s -> 10004.96s]  Fuck
[10004.96s -> 10006.96s]  Okay. Well have have a good night
[10012.72s -> 10019.18s]  What the fuck is a node?
[10019.18s -> 10020.91s]  turf
[10020.91s -> 10027.29s]  Big roll. We want a big roll. Let's get this laid out. Yeah, there are other companies out here
[10029.05s -> 10034.73s]  There's like I think like three different isps, but they all are the they run on like the same infrastructure
[10035.29s -> 10047.07s]  Let's get this out here
[10047.23s -> 10049.23s]  Am I do I got that in the right place?
[10049.23s -> 10051.93s]  I hope so
[10051.93s -> 10054.43s]  Build a labo node. Yeah
[10055.07s -> 10059.12s]  but that's why it's it's it's almost like
[10060.78s -> 10066.94s]  It's really difficult to even explain even to a technician. This is somebody who like whose job it is
[10067.66s -> 10071.98s]  To know like the ins and outs of a network and internet, right and they do they do it's not like they don't
[10072.86s -> 10074.46s]  but
[10074.46s -> 10076.46s]  Wait, you you you tube what?
[10077.18s -> 10082.94s]  What are you talking about? What are you doing? I think it looks fine. It's like, yeah
[10083.82s -> 10093.18s]  But I don't think you don't I don't think you understand. Wait, so you're watching youtube videos? No
[10094.56s -> 10098.64s]  No
[10098.72s -> 10106.48s]  What's youtube? No, it's my tubes. Hey that one was perfect
[10111.85s -> 10124.91s]  Shit, this one's not perfect. Cut it up. Get out of here. Just say i'm famous
[10128.11s -> 10130.11s]  What that's not gonna do anything
[10132.25s -> 10136.73s]  Hey, well, so it's it says here that this is this node is uh, kind of overloaded
[10137.13s -> 10140.09s]  And we're really trying to put out maybe oh fuck I did but look
[10140.73s -> 10143.05s]  Whatever
[10143.05s -> 10145.13s]  Yeah, but I i'm i'm famous
[10146.68s -> 10150.28s]  Okay, that's uh, that's fine. We're not replacing that node
[10151.93s -> 10158.54s]  Okay, who you are? I'm just gonna keep this going
[10159.18s -> 10164.70s]  look at this
[10164.70s -> 10166.70s]  and then there's the other option right of
[10168.25s -> 10169.85s]  maybe like you
[10169.85s -> 10171.85s]  Need to rent like an office
[10172.49s -> 10174.89s]  And like go to the office to stream
[10175.53s -> 10178.35s]  But those are expensive
[10180.86s -> 10182.86s]  Those are really expensive
[10183.10s -> 10186.68s]  How much was this?
[10186.68s -> 10190.01s]  Was that just five grand?
[10199.40s -> 10206.11s]  No, it wasn't was it?
[10206.11s -> 10208.11s]  Shit, I did this one wrong too. Sorry
[10209.26s -> 10211.26s]  but I
[10211.98s -> 10217.82s]  Should I really have to go to get like a stable connection? Should I really have to go to like an office complex?
[10224.38s -> 10226.22s]  That shouldn't be a thing
[10226.22s -> 10234.64s]  It's too many customers and not enough nodes to service all of them. Well
[10236.27s -> 10238.27s]  and like I said previously
[10238.51s -> 10240.51s]  Not very many people give a shit
[10243.13s -> 10245.93s]  as long as you know as long as like netflix works and they can like
[10246.78s -> 10249.82s]  You know play their game or whatever and they can check their emails most people just
[10250.38s -> 10267.61s]  Not gonna be that's not a big deal to anybody but sadly it is um
[10268.33s -> 10270.33s]  It is like this kind of everywhere
[10270.33s -> 10276.51s]  I've heard stories from other streamers and other people that have like do this, you know streaming and youtube and stuff
[10276.51s -> 10278.51s]  And they're like, oh, yeah my provider sucks
[10278.75s -> 10282.83s]  Like why do we all say that you know, it seems like that happens very frequently
[10285.56s -> 10289.24s]  Consistent upload is important to like one percent of all people. Yeah, that's what I mean
[10289.96s -> 10294.86s]  Is this lined up right?
[10294.86s -> 10296.86s]  Yeah, we're good. It's lined up right
[10296.94s -> 10307.56s]  It's gonna take them 10 years to replace nodes
[10307.72s -> 10312.76s]  What they should be doing is replacing nodes that people are having issues with on a priority because 90 people don't notice
[10313.48s -> 10319.00s]  Yeah, but that's where you run into like total just company like bureaucracy
[10319.88s -> 10322.12s]  They have like a blueprint of where they're going
[10322.84s -> 10324.84s]  And if nothing else matters
[10325.66s -> 10327.66s]  It's just company bureaucracy
[10328.30s -> 10329.66s]  That's all it is
[10329.66s -> 10334.17s]  Hey, this node is kind of like might need some work might need to be replaced or split
[10335.42s -> 10338.24s]  No, that's not that's no, that's that one's like in 2024
[10340.52s -> 10342.44s]  Invisible line shit
[10342.44s -> 10348.12s]  I'll get the little piece of tape and do that after i'll do it right now. I'll do it right now. I got it
[10348.12s -> 10350.49s]  I got I got the line. I'll do it
[10352.40s -> 10354.40s]  No, no, no, no, it's uh
[10354.88s -> 10359.20s]  No, it's turf turf not tape not turd. No, not a turd
[10361.76s -> 10370.44s]  turf
[10370.44s -> 10372.44s]  This is so pathetic
[10385.08s -> 10387.08s]  This is a turd
[10388.75s -> 10393.32s]  Oh man
[10393.32s -> 10395.76s]  anyways, uh
[10396.67s -> 10399.47s]  The worst part about it is that there are people that are on the ground
[10400.43s -> 10403.71s]  Whether they're technicians or supervisors that that will tell you
[10404.75s -> 10408.67s]  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, this is like bad or like yeah, they're not gonna replace this. It's not gonna happen
[10409.31s -> 10416.73s]  It's like there's like four different companies that are talking to each other that are like different branches of the set is weird
[10421.84s -> 10423.44s]  It's just really odd
[10423.44s -> 10426.89s]  Let's get a big one here big roll
[10428.67s -> 10430.67s]  No visible lines this time
[10431.93s -> 10438.03s]  Uh
[10438.03s -> 10440.03s]  All right, let's get these rolled out
[10445.16s -> 10449.90s]  Fuck I thought I
[10450.14s -> 10458.60s]  It's all right. What's my end game here?
[10459.96s -> 10462.20s]  to roll out grass
[10462.20s -> 10463.40s]  and then put
[10463.40s -> 10466.20s]  um a flower bed and a swing set
[10471.07s -> 10474.91s]  Come on, don't hit the side. Don't hit the side. Don't hit the tree. Don't hit the tree. Don't hit the tree. Don't ah
[10491.10s -> 10493.10s]  And here's another thing. That's kind of sad
[10493.93s -> 10499.74s]  Even with fiber you can still have something called a noise floor
[10501.48s -> 10504.92s]  People can just dump junk into the network
[10506.64s -> 10512.84s]  Sometimes it doesn't matter if you even if you have like a thousand a thousand which is that's what's available
[10512.84s -> 10514.84s]  Will you have fiber a lot of times?
[10518.44s -> 10522.12s]  This guy told me a story of how somebody had like a halogen light bulb
[10523.52s -> 10525.28s]  That was
[10525.28s -> 10527.28s]  And like fucking up the network years ago
[10528.19s -> 10534.91s]  Somebody he also told me about somebody that something as simple as a a modem not being screwed in tight enough
[10536.04s -> 10542.64s]  Can pump noise into the node and it's like a what what?
[10543.28s -> 10552.06s]  It's almost seems like why how how why is that even possible? Why would that even be a thing that could happen?
[10561.27s -> 10565.13s]  Electrical and veterans. Yeah. No, that's real. Apparently that's real
[10565.69s -> 10570.32s]  Halogen bulbs are really bad for interference. Yeah, I don't that's what I mean
[10571.47s -> 10575.71s]  so when you have like thousands and thousands of thousands of customers and one guy
[10576.99s -> 10578.04s]  like
[10578.04s -> 10582.12s]  has an aquarium in his living room and turns on a bulb or something and
[10582.76s -> 10600.62s]  Buzzes out the node. What do you do? What the hell are you supposed to do? Is that gonna hit better not?
[10605.69s -> 10611.21s]  For fiber any light getting into the cable can basically destroy the whole line. Yeah, it's fucking bonkers
[10612.01s -> 10622.57s]  but you essentially you roll any any
[10623.21s -> 10627.29s]  Internet that you have especially in north america you you're kind of just rolling the dice
[10627.85s -> 10630.17s]  So if you're gonna get a connection that's not gonna have any
[10630.81s -> 10632.81s]  really any major
[10633.21s -> 10637.18s]  interference problems
[10637.18s -> 10640.62s]  And then, you know, sometimes you just get unlucky like like I have
[10641.74s -> 10646.06s]  and even in two different parts of the whole country you have like interference and kind of
[10647.34s -> 10653.15s]  bad node issues
[10653.15s -> 10655.87s]  No, no, i'm not gonna do i'm not gonna hit anything with a hammer. I promise
[10664.65s -> 10665.69s]  No
[10665.69s -> 10667.69s]  No, please
[10667.85s -> 10669.53s]  No
[10669.53s -> 10672.01s]  Cut this tree down just uproot it and move it over there
[10680.38s -> 10685.34s]  And we've had the conversation before it's like, oh just move to here. Just just move to here
[10686.14s -> 10693.69s]  Yeah, I I I like it here, you know, I I like I wanted to live here. I wanted to move here
[10694.17s -> 10696.17s]  This is like where I wanted to live
[10696.25s -> 10707.87s]  Are you overlapping the terse? Is that wasting money?
[10708.75s -> 10710.75s]  Uh, yes, uh probably is definitely
[10711.23s -> 10722.46s]  I would say a hundred percent it is because vegas is a is that a line?
[10726.65s -> 10728.65s]  That's that's a visible line right here, isn't it?
[10732.68s -> 10734.68s]  Uh vegas is a 24-hour city
[10735.24s -> 10736.12s]  so
[10736.12s -> 10737.32s]  you know you
[10737.40s -> 10741.96s]  Up late at night or you're doing something you can go get food. You can go do something you can
[10743.36s -> 10745.36s]  You know something as simple as
[10745.52s -> 10748.88s]  Just getting like something to eat at 12 1 2 o'clock in the morning
[10750.52s -> 10752.52s]  Is it just the texture?
[10753.56s -> 10757.32s]  Vegas doesn't turn off. It's literally 20 everything is open 24 hours
[10758.04s -> 10759.32s]  so it's
[10759.32s -> 10761.08s]  It's great
[10761.08s -> 10762.44s]  especially
[10762.44s -> 10765.16s]  Um if you're a person that's like a up late at night all the time
[10765.72s -> 10770.67s]  There's tons of shit to do tons of shit to see it's great
[10775.63s -> 10779.95s]  Well, yeah, not everything not everything but most things that you want are open
[10782.28s -> 10784.36s]  Turn vegas. Oh, actually I asked
[10785.00s -> 10790.25s]  I asked that you said turn vegas on and off again. I asked that question to the guy this morning. I said
[10790.89s -> 10792.89s]  Can you just like reboot the node?
[10794.12s -> 10799.16s]  And he's like, I can't do that. We would turn off like a thousand like customers. No, that's not gonna happen
[10799.48s -> 10801.24s]  And i'm just like I can
[10801.24s -> 10806.24s]  You can't just restart it and to see if it helps who's gonna notice
[10807.18s -> 10810.94s]  Yeah, like your episode of doctor who is gonna freeze for 10 seconds like who cares
[10811.74s -> 10818.19s]  That person's not gonna know just try it
[10818.75s -> 10823.34s]  turn off
[10823.34s -> 10826.06s]  Vegas just flip the switch on and off once
[10826.70s -> 10833.26s]  What was I doing?
[10833.26s -> 10835.26s]  Turf I want to turf right? Yeah
[10835.58s -> 10838.65s]  Let's lay these out
[10838.65s -> 10840.41s]  This one right here
[10840.41s -> 10844.51s]  And then right here
[10844.83s -> 10850.60s]  It's almost like I need to have them overlap a little bit just so I don't get a line
[10851.48s -> 10856.04s]  I'm gonna do this one first. Remember I have to do it in this order
[10858.80s -> 10860.80s]  Okay, let's do that fucking tree
[10864.01s -> 10866.09s]  Vegas is down for scheduled maintenance
[10866.73s -> 10870.76s]  Am I no, no, I'm not leaving vegas. No
[10871.77s -> 10874.89s]  But fiber is like being built up here all over the place
[10877.08s -> 10879.64s]  There's a lot of new shit a lot of new developments that weren't here
[10890.97s -> 10892.97s]  But why do I like vegas? I just like the
[10894.27s -> 10896.43s]  It's mainly just the 24-hour atmosphere
[10897.15s -> 10902.20s]  Because you know, you guys know sometimes i'll be streaming and sometimes the streams will go to
[10903.32s -> 10904.76s]  10 11 12
[10904.76s -> 10906.44s]  a.m pacific
[10906.44s -> 10911.48s]  And I remember I hadn't like eaten anything really all day. I hadn't really done anything all day. So that's like my time
[10912.72s -> 10917.28s]  Offstream to like even go get food go to the grocery store. You know that that's
[10919.39s -> 10922.35s]  You know if I if I go to sleep at like two three four o'clock in the morning
[10925.05s -> 10929.21s]  It's just stuff is available. All right, that looks good
[10932.41s -> 10934.41s]  No, I mean we make food at home all the time
[10935.13s -> 10939.69s]  Have you seen the plates of food that I that I have from kim does great but making food
[10939.69s -> 10941.77s]  I make food too. I've got a great recipe
[10943.23s -> 10947.26s]  Sell the trees, uh, I don't think I can these are just permanent fixtures
[10949.87s -> 10952.22s]  Turn your flashlight off
[10952.22s -> 10954.22s]  It's got a I got a recipe or two
[10960.75s -> 10961.55s]  um
[10961.55s -> 10964.57s]  Okay, hold on a minute here. I'm gonna give you a countdown
[10968.44s -> 10970.52s]  It's gonna be really loud. Just make sure you know
[10972.92s -> 10973.80s]  one
[10973.80s -> 10977.08s]  Up if you don't know if you came to the stream or later
[10977.88s -> 10980.28s]  This is louder than anything in the whole game and I can't turn it down
[10981.00s -> 10982.60s]  so
[10982.60s -> 10986.36s]  Uh turn your volume down a lot because it's gonna blow out your microphone
[10987.82s -> 10988.88s]  one
[10988.88s -> 10989.84s]  two
[10989.84s -> 10992.54s]  three
[10992.54s -> 10996.38s]  I you can't take them down. Never mind. I did that. I might as well water the damn thing
[10997.02s -> 11003.37s]  All right, big roll
[11003.37s -> 11006.76s]  Let's go right here
[11006.76s -> 11012.09s]  But so the but so for instance the internet has stabilized, right?
[11014.08s -> 11018.80s]  It's we're fine. We've been fine for like probably 20 30 minutes straight here. It's just so
[11020.22s -> 11022.94s]  It's like impossible to like find and fix
[11023.90s -> 11025.90s]  It's the saddest truth there is
[11035.21s -> 11037.21s]  Peek your mic. Maybe that'll fix it
[11037.45s -> 11042.12s]  Because those of you that remember back in october
[11042.76s -> 11049.44s]  When we first moved in here, they didn't even work. It was all fucked up tons and tons of problems
[11049.44s -> 11051.84s]  It was it was awful couldn't be used
[11053.26s -> 11058.46s]  And that is a scenario where they fixed it and there was a big big problem that they fixed
[11059.10s -> 11061.64s]  It's not like that anymore
[11061.64s -> 11063.88s]  Just kind of just randomly throughout the day just
[11067.15s -> 11071.23s]  I'm fine. I'm good. Hey, what's going on? What are you using the internet? It's me the internet. I'm fine
[11071.63s -> 11086.65s]  That scared my cat. Oh, I'm so sorry to that little kitty
[11087.21s -> 11091.29s]  What's gas name?
[11091.29s -> 11099.74s]  sprinkles
[11099.74s -> 11100.78s]  george
[11100.78s -> 11102.68s]  Pretty cool cat name
[11102.68s -> 11111.44s]  Was that in the same person?
[11116.28s -> 11119.64s]  Uh, how many how many more of these this is not even real grass
[11121.34s -> 11124.54s]  I'm just coming to the realization here. This shouldn't even real
[11125.66s -> 11127.66s]  I'm laying out a football field
[11127.98s -> 11130.16s]  This is not even actually grass
[11134.27s -> 11136.94s]  What it is
[11136.94s -> 11139.76s]  This is not astroturf
[11139.76s -> 11149.88s]  It's topsoil
[11149.88s -> 11154.54s]  They sell this shit at like the home depot by the roll. Is this how you make grass?
[11166.75s -> 11169.63s]  Yes, I mean, yeah only if you want it quickly
[11170.43s -> 11172.43s]  No, this is not the real thing
[11173.05s -> 11176.73s]  you plant seeds in the ground and water it and
[11177.61s -> 11179.05s]  No, this is like
[11179.05s -> 11181.44s]  This is not real grass
[11181.44s -> 11194.19s]  You still using seeds. Yeah, that's the natural way
[11195.29s -> 11206.94s]  There's a line there
[11206.94s -> 11208.70s]  Come on. Oh
[11208.70s -> 11231.26s]  That felt so good. Did you see how good that felt? I got it. I got it
[11231.34s -> 11233.34s]  I mean, I missed it, but I got it. I'm good
[11233.82s -> 11240.84s]  But this is bothering me though. Why can I not remove these that's bothering me?
[11241.40s -> 11243.40s]  Can I take the little tape the roll of tape and do it?
[11251.44s -> 11255.36s]  Shit, come on really
[11255.36s -> 11261.88s]  It is a bother
[11261.88s -> 11263.64s]  I wasted it
[11263.64s -> 11276.14s]  I mean maybe a little bit. Can you put the maybe chips around the trees?
[11276.78s -> 11280.20s]  I'll try that
[11280.20s -> 11284.76s]  How much is this actually costing a lot of money what I for oh, no, that's not that much money
[11291.71s -> 11293.76s]  Missed
[11293.76s -> 11296.67s]  Wait, wait, wait, I'll do it this way
[11296.67s -> 11298.67s]  I didn't really miss
[11299.53s -> 11301.53s]  Didn't really hit it either though
[11304.67s -> 11307.55s]  Stream stream later in the day try to stay away from the prime time
[11309.52s -> 11311.92s]  it's it's just it's tough it really is because
[11312.80s -> 11316.99s]  I if you stick it if I let's say I started it like
[11317.63s -> 11320.83s]  seven eight nine o'clock pacific time, that's so
[11321.77s -> 11324.19s]  Unbearably late for so many people
[11326.48s -> 11331.84s]  And then on the same thing if you stream at you know, six o'clock in the morning seven o'clock in the morning pacific
[11331.92s -> 11336.88s]  It's just screwing it up for half the other. It's it's kind of it's difficult to try to figure out that right spot
[11340.56s -> 11344.51s]  But I I don't I can't really stream
[11345.23s -> 11347.05s]  at
[11347.05s -> 11349.29s]  Like fucking eight o'clock in the morning. I can't
[11350.17s -> 11352.41s]  I don't think I don't have the energy to do it
[11352.41s -> 11356.89s]  I don't I can't like get into whatever i'm talking fucking I I don't like wake up really
[11357.21s -> 11359.77s]  It takes me like two hours to sort of get up to like really wake up
[11364.64s -> 11366.16s]  and i'm at my
[11366.16s -> 11369.36s]  Highest energy levels at like this time right now
[11370.56s -> 11372.96s]  My whole life it's been like that ever since I was like 16
[11374.51s -> 11376.51s]  And I can't change it
[11377.93s -> 11380.43s]  I've tried a million times
[11380.43s -> 11384.11s]  But all through college it was I was peak hours for my brain
[11385.07s -> 11387.07s]  is between like one and
[11387.47s -> 11392.75s]  Five pm really is like where i'm at my highest energy. God damn it. I keep fucking this up
[11394.00s -> 11404.54s]  But I can't even tell who cares
[11404.54s -> 11406.78s]  You were born a 16 year old
[11407.34s -> 11409.34s]  No, i'm just saying like I I have
[11410.56s -> 11412.80s]  Even if I get up in the morning for weeks
[11413.52s -> 11416.28s]  I'm still a slug
[11416.28s -> 11417.88s]  I think i'm one of those like
[11417.88s -> 11420.51s]  I mean, I don't really abide by like the
[11420.91s -> 11422.91s]  energy fields and stuff
[11423.55s -> 11425.47s]  but
[11425.47s -> 11430.30s]  Is there like a do you just can you get like power from the moon?
[11432.22s -> 11434.22s]  Will you roll past the tree?
[11438.89s -> 11441.29s]  Can you be like a moon person and not like a sun person?
[11448.19s -> 11450.19s]  Okay, why is this not working?
[11452.60s -> 11456.33s]  This is gonna drive me crazy
[11456.33s -> 11463.82s]  Oh my god, why?
[11463.90s -> 11469.64s]  I I can't get this
[11469.64s -> 11481.90s]  Nope, i'll put flowers there. That's okay. Yeah, i'll put a flower there. It'll be fine. Oh, look at this
[11484.12s -> 11486.12s]  Ah nice. Oh, I like this
[11487.00s -> 11489.00s]  Very cool. Very excellent. I think
[11499.04s -> 11501.72s]  Yeah, I would say that's excellent
[11501.72s -> 11504.68s]  I mean, I know i'm patting myself on the back there, but I think that's kind of excellent
[11506.17s -> 11511.26s]  No, I need the big one
[11511.26s -> 11513.58s]  but
[11513.58s -> 11515.90s]  Internet, I mean, we're just having a conversation here
[11517.92s -> 11519.92s]  Apparently having a static ip
[11520.76s -> 11522.36s]  will
[11522.36s -> 11524.38s]  Help apparently
[11524.38s -> 11526.38s]  I got a line here on the left
[11526.46s -> 11537.56s]  And it's weird
[11537.56s -> 11540.20s]  Because I don't know if anybody knows anything about networking in here. Maybe you do
[11541.40s -> 11543.40s]  So I need someone to explain this to me
[11545.07s -> 11548.99s]  If you if you do then just chime in this is open forum chime in
[11550.49s -> 11552.01s]  The guy on the ground
[11552.01s -> 11553.69s]  Like the guy in the truck
[11553.69s -> 11556.57s]  The dude that does all the networking shit
[11558.01s -> 11560.57s]  Told me that having a static ip
[11562.09s -> 11563.93s]  actually somehow
[11563.93s -> 11565.85s]  makes your
[11565.85s -> 11567.29s]  traffic
[11567.29s -> 11569.29s]  Like a higher priority in the node
[11572.28s -> 11573.40s]  is
[11573.40s -> 11575.88s]  Doubt I would that's what I was told that it was possible that I could help
[11581.05s -> 11587.84s]  Doubt it static if he does nothing but I mean, but this is somebody that is
[11588.72s -> 11599.44s]  Am I gonna what's going on here? Is it stuck on the tree? Did I pay for this? No
[11600.59s -> 11603.55s]  I have a business package. So it all support is
[11604.59s -> 11617.87s]  There it's possible to have their qos set differently depending on address assignment
[11618.43s -> 11623.45s]  It's possible that because from what he was explaining to me
[11624.81s -> 11626.24s]  is
[11626.24s -> 11628.67s]  Because it's static
[11629.31s -> 11631.55s]  The cox just has rip
[11632.43s -> 11638.59s]  And it never changes and they know exactly where it is and exactly the dns. It doesn't change at all ever
[11639.07s -> 11643.21s]  You'd be saying it to calm me down
[11643.77s -> 11647.53s]  I wasn't like a raving lunatic when this person came
[11650.01s -> 11662.67s]  All right, calm down, sir. Let me tell you it got just easy. I'm not like a maniac
[11666.30s -> 11670.70s]  but so that's what the guy and and this was the person who was responsible for
[11671.90s -> 11675.18s]  like maintenance and monitoring all these networks
[11676.44s -> 11681.48s]  And then the guy on the phone like just the tech support guy said no, that's not true
[11684.99s -> 11686.43s]  So which one is it?
[11686.43s -> 11703.15s]  It's like they have like five different scripts for different scenarios. Like which what's the real what can somebody just tell me the truth?
[11703.95s -> 11705.95s]  Can somebody please help me?
[11706.35s -> 11716.60s]  We already yeah. No, we we've been on the business package. Ah, damn it. I missed it. No, I didn't I no I got it
[11717.24s -> 11719.68s]  We've been on business business this whole time
[11726.03s -> 11728.03s]  But it's almost like I don't know who to trust
[11728.51s -> 11730.75s]  It's like I have a telltale choice
[11734.27s -> 11736.43s]  Who's the one that i'm gonna like go with?
[11748.86s -> 11753.32s]  Me we're almost I almost have a legitimate yard here
[11759.28s -> 11764.64s]  Dude, like all these isps are so all over the place. It's so fucked. I remember when I first called
[11765.44s -> 11769.23s]  To like set up a business package and I said does business have priority
[11769.87s -> 11771.47s]  over residential
[11771.47s -> 11773.45s]  Yeah
[11773.45s -> 11775.77s]  Uh, okay. Cool. That's pretty cool
[11776.49s -> 11780.09s]  And then like three days later I was told no, that's not true who told you that
[11781.58s -> 11784.62s]  Who the fuck is running shit over there? Like what's going on?
[11790.22s -> 11792.22s]  it's just like we have like
[11793.00s -> 11795.00s]  12,000 employees and
[11796.51s -> 11801.10s]  All of them are not on the same page ever. What the fuck
[11820.16s -> 11823.44s]  He's going out. He's getting into another episode. No, no, no, i'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good
[11823.52s -> 11825.84s]  Wait, i'm gonna do this because it's cost effective
[11830.67s -> 11833.47s]  Static ip is an address for you specifically doesn't give you priority
[11833.47s -> 11837.07s]  But it does give them a direct point to know it's you rather than the guy down the street because when wait
[11837.15s -> 11839.15s]  That was a that was a one guy statement
[11840.32s -> 11844.64s]  Because when you connect to the internet the isp gives you a different ip every time you connect imagine having a street address
[11844.64s -> 11847.76s]  That changes every time you mail a letter as opposed to a fixed number so they know it's you
[11849.12s -> 11865.02s]  Well, let's see if it does anything
[11865.02s -> 11869.77s]  Do I have to water the grass?
[11869.77s -> 11871.05s]  Can I get these both?
[11871.05s -> 11873.05s]  I'm thinking one go. Let's try it
[11873.21s -> 11875.21s]  I'm gonna try it. I hope I get it
[11882.43s -> 11884.83s]  All right, let's try it again if I don't get it this time
[11884.83s -> 11887.39s]  I swear to god i'm fucking canceling my wow subscription
[11892.17s -> 11894.73s]  Ah, it's cancelled. Fuck it. I don't want to play it anymore
[11902.84s -> 11906.36s]  No, don't don't do it
[11906.36s -> 11909.56s]  Is classic wow going to be a separate subscription than regular? Wow?
[11910.28s -> 11914.44s]  Does anybody have any idea is it gonna be two different games or is it just gonna be two different clients?
[11914.44s -> 11926.56s]  How's it gonna work?
[11926.56s -> 11928.56s]  Oh, okay. That's cool
[11928.96s -> 11935.16s]  All right, we're almost done with the yard
[11941.77s -> 11947.29s]  Uh, i'm just putting plants around these i'm done with this shit. I ain't doing that anymore one more here
[11948.01s -> 11950.73s]  Like one more right here and then we're covering this with bushes
[11967.52s -> 11970.48s]  Ah, it's always so misleading to me. Come on
[11973.10s -> 11974.70s]  I got the money. It's all right
[11974.70s -> 11980.35s]  All right one last one. It's I this is too addicting to just do this shit
[11981.45s -> 11988.08s]  That's it
[11988.08s -> 11990.08s]  Nice. All right, let's get in there
[11991.55s -> 11994.43s]  All right. I don't care about the front here. I'll put like a welcome mat or something
[11995.76s -> 11997.76s]  Oh, there's so much more to do
[11997.84s -> 12001.29s]  Look at how much more there is to do
[12001.37s -> 12003.61s]  There's so many more things to do
[12005.76s -> 12006.96s]  Uh
[12006.96s -> 12010.00s]  I think I could get him
[12010.00s -> 12012.40s]  Let's try this i'm gonna try to just plan it out
[12022.08s -> 12024.08s]  Look, it's can't be it's not gonna be perfect
[12028.88s -> 12030.88s]  I wonder if that's lined up right? Who knows?
[12031.20s -> 12041.44s]  It doesn't have to be perfect. Just get it right
[12042.00s -> 12044.88s]  Okay, what's the furthest one this one? No, this one

[16607.68s -> 16609.68s]  brick oven house
[16611.36s -> 16613.36s]  My house just is a pizza oven
[16622.33s -> 16624.49s]  It's fine. It's fine
[16633.24s -> 16635.24s]  Sooner or later, we'll have a good house
[16643.36s -> 16645.60s]  So earlier in the stream
[16646.32s -> 16648.75s]  You probably noticed I was
[16648.75s -> 16651.34s]  I was very high energy
[16651.34s -> 16654.06s]  I'm very low energy right now for the last like probably hour
[16654.70s -> 16656.81s]  I hit the wall
[16656.81s -> 16659.37s]  So if you don't know I didn't sleep very much last night
[16660.01s -> 16664.49s]  I only slept for about three hours. I was up at like seven o'clock in the morning
[16665.44s -> 16669.20s]  And I hit my second wind and turned the stream on it was like a psycho for three hours
[16670.46s -> 16673.18s]  And now i'm just like
[16673.18s -> 16688.56s]  Ah, I don't hate the outside here on the bright side. The internet has stabilized. Yeah, it's been pretty good
[16690.28s -> 16699.44s]  Take what we can get right
[16699.44s -> 16701.44s]  Go to bed. No, not yet

[16706.14s -> 16707.90s]  All right question
[16707.90s -> 16712.06s]  Um, should I do the home alone house tomorrow? I ain't doing anything. I should maybe i'll do well
[16712.06s -> 16714.06s]  Like isn't there like a horror movie house
[16714.14s -> 16718.22s]  I feel like if we're gonna do house flipper I may as well dedicate like a couple of streams to it
[16719.47s -> 16721.15s]  That's right beep
[16721.15s -> 16728.46s]  Scream at me
[16728.46s -> 16731.72s]  This actually is just a pizza
[16731.72s -> 16734.52s]  I should just block this off and have these be three different pizza ovens
[16737.05s -> 16740.17s]  My house is just a giant pizza oven
[16741.16s -> 16754.38s]  And I live in it over here. That's just stupid enough for me to want to do it
[16754.94s -> 16763.55s]  I'm not making the pt house. I'll fucking throw up

[16816.73s -> 16820.01s]  Just make yeah, I can make like a like a pizza parlor. That's a good idea
[16820.81s -> 16825.08s]  So what can I do for this?
[16825.08s -> 16827.08s]  Personally close this up. I need three
[16831.16s -> 16842.00s]  I don't have enough. Can I seriously not build more one at a time? I thought I could
[16843.28s -> 16845.64s]  Isn't it q or something?
[16845.72s -> 16849.74s]  We're like w e r where what is it t q?

[16867.80s -> 16879.26s]  All right. This one's gonna be coal
[16880.22s -> 16882.22s]  For like extra crispy pizzas
[16882.94s -> 16887.55s]  This would give me wood fire coal fire
[16888.11s -> 16889.47s]  and then
[16889.47s -> 16890.43s]  um
[16890.43s -> 16892.35s]  I don't know microwave
[16892.35s -> 16897.32s]  How else does half of the restaurants make their pizzas and is the parlor the garden doesn't even matter
[16897.96s -> 16900.92s]  This is like the okay. Uh, this is the way you come in
[16901.88s -> 16905.56s]  Brick oven
[16905.56s -> 16911.16s]  Yeah, the whole thing's a pizza oven and then the coal look I can do coal and let's just block this out in my brain here
[16914.27s -> 16918.11s]  Yeah, you just like fucking frisbee the pizza into there. You can have like 10 of them at a time
[16919.07s -> 16924.72s]  Let's see. All right. We got ceramic charcoal
[16928.12s -> 16934.09s]  This could be charcoal
[16934.09s -> 16936.09s]  Need shelves and racks for the pizza
[16937.26s -> 16944.64s]  Yeah
[16944.64s -> 16947.53s]  ceramic
[16947.53s -> 16957.52s]  This looks like charcoal. It's got to be just like
[16958.68s -> 16960.68s]  Brown black or something
[16961.00s -> 16963.85s]  That looks all right
[16963.85s -> 16973.50s]  Let's try this
[16974.14s -> 16990.70s]  That looks terrible
[16990.70s -> 16992.70s]  This is shit
[16992.70s -> 16994.70s]  This is a shit idea
[16994.86s -> 17018.38s]  Okay the back floor
[17021.64s -> 17023.72s]  This looks like wood wood fire
[17024.04s -> 17028.88s]  Fire
[17028.88s -> 17045.15s]  Rug a rug fired oven. Okay, looks good
[17045.95s -> 17056.00s]  and then this needs to be like
[17056.56s -> 17065.02s]  black
[17065.02s -> 17066.38s]  Just need
[17066.38s -> 17068.38s]  Not blue
[17068.78s -> 17071.47s]  It just needs to be black
[17071.79s -> 17073.79s]  They don't black carpets
[17079.90s -> 17087.32s]  A pizza rug
[17087.40s -> 17089.40s]  Yeah, but that's for the main hallway
[17089.72s -> 17091.72s]  Can I just paint the ground black?
[17092.52s -> 17094.52s]  Imagine that
[17095.16s -> 17107.18s]  Imagine painting your ground black doing some weird shit in there. I don't think I can paint the ground
[17111.74s -> 17130.49s]  I mean they could do the charcoal to be the sides
[17140.16s -> 17143.04s]  The apartment has black floors. That's interesting
[17144.48s -> 17153.37s]  I mean, I guess maybe like entryways
[17153.77s -> 17159.07s]  Oh, that's fine. We need like heat lamps, too
[17161.72s -> 17163.48s]  I'm gonna air it out
[17163.48s -> 17172.75s]  All right. So let me see
[17172.75s -> 17174.75s]  So the wooden paneling is to go in here
[17178.73s -> 17180.73s]  Maybe we can get actual wood paneling
[17185.69s -> 17188.60s]  wall panels
[17188.60s -> 17189.64s]  Wood
[17189.64s -> 17191.64s]  Here we go. Yeah, that's perfect
[17192.36s -> 17195.05s]  Is the same thing? No
[17196.41s -> 17206.14s]  Do they even have pizzas?
[17208.04s -> 17230.70s]  I wish I could do this faster. It's a pizza hut taco bell combo
[17233.21s -> 17236.11s]  Why did you say that?
[17236.11s -> 17238.11s]  You just said the magic
[17239.34s -> 17241.34s]  like 14 words
[17242.17s -> 17245.61s]  Pizza hut and taco bell combo 9. Fuck
[17248.33s -> 17252.81s]  Wait pizza hut and taco bell combo. Those are syllables. Those aren't words
[17253.85s -> 17255.85s]  You could tell i'm fucking tired
[17260.78s -> 17262.67s]  Fucking tired
[17262.67s -> 17264.83s]  I counted syllables as if they were words
[17265.47s -> 17267.08s]  but you said
[17267.08s -> 17269.08s]  You said pizza hut and taco bell
[17276.17s -> 17278.89s]  You said the combination of things that make me hungry
[17286.46s -> 17289.26s]  I've entered sleeping mode. Yeah, I have um, I am
[17290.54s -> 17292.64s]  I might have to call it soon. Unfortunately
[17293.52s -> 17295.84s]  I'm just glad I was able to stream for at least a while
[17297.57s -> 17300.61s]  And this is relaxing and fun. This is like helping me go to bed
[17301.57s -> 17310.72s]  How do people do 24-hour streams? I can barely stay awake for 24 hours
[17324.42s -> 17327.70s]  Wooden box room. What am I doing?
[17328.66s -> 17333.62s]  What am I making a pizza house? What is it? What are we doing? What are we doing right now?
[17335.04s -> 17337.20s]  Making three giant pizza ovens
[17340.26s -> 17341.54s]  Why?
[17341.54s -> 17346.03s]  Why am I doing this?
[17346.03s -> 17348.35s]  I feel like if I walked in this room, it'd be like
[17352.78s -> 17355.82s]  I want to is it weird that I want to sprint around in a circle in this room
[17356.75s -> 17359.71s]  I want to fucking run around. I know this is basketball court now
[17360.43s -> 17369.94s]  I want to just fuck it looks like so waxed and slippery and shiny
[17369.94s -> 17374.50s]  I want to just start here and sprint and stop and turn and sprint so it goes
[17378.08s -> 17380.08s]  That's so badly want to do that
[17380.08s -> 17390.42s]  Whatever gets you off. Well, yeah, that's fine
[17391.22s -> 17397.10s]  Have you guys ever seen like a freshly waxed basketball court?
[17398.67s -> 17400.67s]  Oh, it's something to behold
[17400.75s -> 17402.75s]  it's just like when the uh
[17402.75s -> 17405.71s]  So when the when the when the gazebo goes over the ice
[17407.71s -> 17412.19s]  And it's brand new ice freshly shaved down freshly like coated
[17416.19s -> 17418.19s]  The zip. Yeah, the zamboni, whatever
[17422.11s -> 17427.31s]  I always want every time anytime that the the I can't say zamboni. That's a gazebo
[17431.74s -> 17434.30s]  So anytime the zamboni goes across
[17435.42s -> 17437.66s]  Same scenario. I want to get a running start
[17438.75s -> 17440.75s]  like wet slippery just
[17441.37s -> 17442.99s]  zambonied ice
[17442.99s -> 17448.69s]  Start outside the rink and run as fast as I okay. So let's say that's the rink starts right there, right?
[17449.49s -> 17455.25s]  I want to run as fast as I humanly possibly can jump dive face first slide across the whole rink
[17455.65s -> 17473.94s]  Did you just make like a golden knights dis?
[17479.38s -> 17485.49s]  Why the golden knights did a fantastic fucking job
[17486.29s -> 17497.07s]  I feel like I could play like goalie for a minute. I think I could like stop a slap shot. I really do
[17498.03s -> 17501.62s]  If I ever got like the balls
[17503.10s -> 17505.10s]  imagine if I like contacted
[17505.34s -> 17508.69s]  Like the glow like the golden knights organization
[17509.39s -> 17512.59s]  And I just had a star player like try to score a goal on me
[17513.15s -> 17521.02s]  I feel like I feel like I might die
[17521.26s -> 17527.44s]  I don't know why i'm picturing this weird like adam sandler movie scenario
[17528.16s -> 17532.98s]  Well, like I get the puck right in the visor right in the between the eyes
[17543.44s -> 17545.44s]  I'm not doing all those up there
[17546.37s -> 17547.57s]  I can't
[17547.57s -> 17552.18s]  That's so small
[17552.26s -> 17558.27s]  Do them do them do them. All right. All right. All right. I'm doing i'm doing i'm doing i'm doing them. I'm doing them
[17559.07s -> 17573.78s]  Finish painting the other room. I will don't worry. I will
[17574.50s -> 17582.10s]  Don't worry. I'm gonna come back tomorrow. I'm gonna be rested. We're gonna have a static ip
[17582.74s -> 17584.74s]  And there's gonna be no drop frames
[17585.14s -> 17588.58s]  And what are the like fucking wizard of oz bullshit made up scenarios?
[17588.58s -> 17590.58s]  Am I gonna come up with here that i'm not gonna be real?
[17591.06s -> 17592.34s]  I wonder
[17601.23s -> 17602.91s]  I can't paint all the ceiling
[17602.91s -> 17605.15s]  I'm gonna leave that there. No, i'm not I can't handle that
[17612.91s -> 17614.37s]  Karate
[17614.37s -> 17620.00s]  Get that looks good
[17620.56s -> 17623.84s]  That's a nice wooden room. Ah, fuck. No, it's not done
[17631.17s -> 17635.49s]  This room is just bizarrely weird. I just feel like I need to I feel like I come in here
[17635.97s -> 17638.93s]  And like sit in the corner and need to be quiet in here
[17641.57s -> 17643.97s]  Uh, this is like a weird. I don't know why this reminds me
[17644.45s -> 17648.53s]  I don't know. I feel like I need to be like quiet in this room and i'm being like punished
[17652.90s -> 17662.27s]  It's like the wooden room. You just have to go in here and be quiet in there. There's a window though. So
[17662.91s -> 17687.23s]  rats
[17687.47s -> 17689.55s]  Grass coming up
[17689.55s -> 17691.07s]  in
[17691.07s -> 17696.62s]  My damn it. I can't make the ceiling wood
[17699.98s -> 17703.02s]  I can't make the ceiling wood. It doesn't work
[17703.82s -> 17706.02s]  Okay. What was this one gonna be?
[17706.02s -> 17709.50s]  charcoal
[17709.50s -> 17715.49s]  Go to sleep. I'm good. I'm good. Don't worry. I'm gonna wrap it up here in a few minutes
[17715.81s -> 17718.43s]  I'm going for about five hours
[17718.43s -> 17720.29s]  I'm very tired
[17720.29s -> 17726.50s]  But I had a lot of fun. It's fun to come back. Why did I just what the fuck am I doing?
[17735.94s -> 17737.94s]  I'm typing in from reddit

[17773.12s -> 17775.12s]  That's so fucking ridiculous
[17775.44s -> 17777.44s]  I'm really not even that tired
[17778.38s -> 17780.38s]  Yeah, it's time. That's time to call it

[17812.13s -> 17813.49s]  I'm very tired
[17813.49s -> 17815.17s]  Wrapper

[17846.54s -> 17851.65s]  oh

[17874.40s -> 17876.40s]  20,000 dropped frames in five hours
[17877.44s -> 17879.44s]  We were stable for a while though
[17884.96s -> 17888.46s]  Thank you again everybody for putting up with this
[17890.13s -> 17892.93s]  Uh, it can be very frustrating. It's very frustrating for me
[17894.16s -> 17896.48s]  But it's something that i'm actively trying to fix
[17897.52s -> 17899.52s]  Hopefully it's not too much of a
[17899.86s -> 17902.21s]  Pain in the ass for you to watch

[18163.22s -> 18169.65s]  I didn't think you'd be streaming tonight. Thanks for the surprise neither did I but thankfully we could get something in
[18170.29s -> 18172.29s]  And have some fun because I had fun
[18172.61s -> 18175.58s]  It was fun learning how to cut grass with a weed whacker
[18176.06s -> 18180.16s]  Talked a little bit of shit had a little bit of fun
[18180.40s -> 18183.62s]  Hopefully you enjoyed it. Thank you for the 250
[18185.46s -> 18191.87s]  Uh, thank you halo soft boy for the 260. I don't think that's a straw man. I think that's a real man
[18192.99s -> 18195.71s]  Something I said earlier and then they're laughing about it
[18200.38s -> 18202.62s]  rapper
[18202.62s -> 18205.18s]  Reddit. Oh my god
[18205.24s -> 18214.69s]  Autopilot man just on autopilot dr fudge. Thanks for the 15 dollars
[18216.61s -> 18224.54s]  Germa, I can't hear the hammer turn it up. I did at some point there. I really actually did
[18226.72s -> 18232.64s]  Am I ever gonna get new brb end stream overlays? Yes, blordow is currently working on them right now
[18234.99s -> 18236.75s]  in a week or two
[18236.75s -> 18242.10s]  Depending on how long it takes them to make it. We're going to have 10 to 12 new songs
[18242.74s -> 18244.10s]  for background
[18244.10s -> 18247.78s]  When we do the wind down and a wind down animated screen
[18249.86s -> 18254.21s]  Something to play in the background. That's not the stream over so there'll be
[18254.93s -> 18257.89s]  A large playlist of songs that he has created
[18259.74s -> 18265.57s]  For the wind down specifically so there'll be two portions of the end of the stream this one
[18266.38s -> 18268.38s]  Which will not have this stream over
[18268.86s -> 18272.45s]  It'll be more thought out, you know
[18274.30s -> 18277.34s]  And then we'll transition to this one when it's actually time to leave
[18279.41s -> 18281.97s]  We have some ideas. He's got a couple of great ideas for
[18283.22s -> 18286.42s]  Stuff that happens in the background and the scene and we've been talking back and forth
[18287.38s -> 18298.30s]  It's probably going to be pretty great. Don't get rid of the screen songs. You no, no, no
[18298.38s -> 18300.38s]  That's going to be added to a circulation
[18302.51s -> 18305.31s]  so the intro and outro songs will stay the same but
[18306.35s -> 18309.63s]  If I want to I can pump in one of the new ones in random places
[18309.71s -> 18312.67s]  I can have two or three lined up. I can change it once in a while
[18314.37s -> 18316.37s]  It's just adding not subtracting. So don't worry
[18322.02s -> 18325.18s]  So don't worry. It should be fun. Blordow makes
[18325.74s -> 18328.22s]  amazing music
[18328.22s -> 18331.18s]  He's one of the best when it comes to making
[18332.22s -> 18333.98s]  He makes like really great
[18333.98s -> 18335.48s]  just chill
[18335.48s -> 18336.54s]  relaxing
[18336.54s -> 18337.34s]  music
[18337.34s -> 18339.50s]  He's got great talent when it comes to making
[18340.77s -> 18343.81s]  Like listen to this just listen. This is just like a this is just beautiful
[18344.37s -> 18347.76s]  He's got great ambient talent
[18347.84s -> 18355.84s]  So there'll be uh, essentially what we talked about is I was like I want a lot more of this
[18356.80s -> 18358.21s]  so
[18358.21s -> 18360.77s]  We're gonna get more of these low-key ambient tracks
[18361.49s -> 18363.49s]  That he is very much known for so
[18373.34s -> 18376.22s]  But thank you to dr fudge for the 15 dollars. Really appreciate that
[18379.42s -> 18382.62s]  Thank you. Uh three dollars from Leroy. Thank you Leroy
[18383.26s -> 18386.96s]  Hey germa, good luck with the colonoscopy. I'm 26 and had to have one of those last year
[18387.52s -> 18389.52s]  For my ongoing stomach problems
[18389.52s -> 18392.32s]  I really appreciate that you talk openly and without shame
[18392.88s -> 18396.16s]  About this kind of stuff makes me feel like less of a weird gross goblin
[18397.04s -> 18401.76s]  Anyway, I wish you the best. Hope you get a chance to check out some fire sign theater stuff in the future
[18403.98s -> 18405.36s]  yeah, i've
[18405.36s -> 18407.76s]  i've been a pretty much an open book when it comes to
[18408.62s -> 18410.00s]  illnesses and stuff
[18410.00s -> 18413.95s]  I feel like it's
[18413.95s -> 18415.47s]  it's just
[18415.47s -> 18422.11s]  I have this shit. I have this problem. I have these things that I have to do. I've had it for pretty much over a decade now
[18422.75s -> 18425.23s]  So it's like what I like to pretend it doesn't exist
[18428.34s -> 18430.72s]  I just want to make sure
[18430.72s -> 18432.72s]  That everything is good
[18433.23s -> 18435.23s]  Because I have not been
[18435.71s -> 18438.32s]  really evaluated
[18438.32s -> 18439.90s]  since like
[18439.90s -> 18441.90s]  2014 2013
[18442.64s -> 18446.16s]  Maybe a little bit later. Maybe 2015 to the point when I have my last real
[18446.80s -> 18448.80s]  Evaluation at a sigmoid
[18448.80s -> 18452.24s]  Oscopy, which is not the same as a colonoscopy. It's the same thing
[18452.88s -> 18457.52s]  But they don't go as far into your intestinal tract. They just kind of go up
[18458.59s -> 18463.84s]  Into like the lower half of your colon. They don't go all the way in so yes
[18464.32s -> 18467.44s]  You can say they need to go deeper. They do. Yes, they do
[18469.70s -> 18473.70s]  And i'm i'm doing i've had kind of some issues recently over the last six months
[18474.59s -> 18477.39s]  I don't know if they're related to the colitis and all these other
[18477.95s -> 18482.74s]  IBD issues, but I don't know. I just I it was a good idea
[18482.90s -> 18486.90s]  He said let's just do it just do the whole thing and let's be certain certain, right?
[18488.32s -> 18497.39s]  So, oh that that's happening next week. The prep is the worst. Yeah, that's why i'm gonna have to take
[18498.03s -> 18501.90s]  I'm probably gonna have to take like two or three days off
[18502.54s -> 18504.56s]  Because you can't eat
[18504.56s -> 18508.00s]  A full 24 hours before the procedure you cannot eat food
[18508.48s -> 18510.75s]  So I won't really be
[18510.75s -> 18514.03s]  I won't have any energy. I'll be tired. I'll be kind of irritable probably
[18515.28s -> 18520.96s]  So I don't think I can stream a day before the day of and maybe even the day after depending on how the drugs
[18522.00s -> 18530.00s]  Um, I did say I wasn't gonna do any drugs going straight up. No sedation, but depending on the practice
[18531.25s -> 18534.21s]  You actually might from my understanding is they might not offer that
[18536.74s -> 18541.14s]  I just don't like the idea of going under. I really don't if it's it freaks me out
[18541.70s -> 18546.83s]  You should be okay the day after
[18546.83s -> 18548.11s]  Yeah, we'll see
[18548.11s -> 18552.11s]  I'm definitely gonna do at least the day before and the day of obviously I won't be able to do anything the day of
[18554.13s -> 18556.21s]  but
[18556.21s -> 18559.90s]  Anesthesia just freaks me out. I've had it done once
[18561.63s -> 18565.55s]  I just don't like it. I just don't like the idea. I don't like the whole process
[18568.27s -> 18572.43s]  So I already talked to them. I said I either don't want sedation or I want it
[18574.27s -> 18577.73s]  Light enough where like very light so
[18578.45s -> 18580.61s]  Hopefully I can you know, they actually adhere to that
[18591.73s -> 18594.85s]  Yeah, yeah, you know, it's it's a it's a conscious sedation, right?
[18598.70s -> 18601.02s]  I've had tons of operations and I just enjoy it now
[18601.98s -> 18605.02s]  Yeah, it's I guess something you just kind of will would get used to
[18613.44s -> 18615.44s]  but I I think i'm just kind of
[18615.76s -> 18619.04s]  Weirdo and I always like to have this weird scenario in my brain
[18619.68s -> 18622.80s]  Where it's like
[18622.80s -> 18624.80s]  Okay, like here we go
[18625.38s -> 18628.66s]  All right. It's time for you to go under. All right, here it comes
[18628.74s -> 18630.98s]  Oh here you're gonna feel a little a little pinch in your arm
[18631.54s -> 18637.30s]  Okay, and now you're going down. Here we go. All right. We'll see you soon. Have a nice sleep
[18640.13s -> 18644.37s]  There's a fire in the building fire and i'm just like there's a fire
[18645.33s -> 18647.33s]  I can't do anything
[18648.64s -> 18650.64s]  uh, you know what I mean like
[18653.34s -> 18655.34s]  Like if fire alarm goes off and you're just like
[18659.30s -> 18663.57s]  Was somebody gonna pick you up
[18664.05s -> 18668.29s]  You shouldn't overthink things like that. I know but you don't have like
[18671.09s -> 18676.77s]  It's the same person that told you that i'm scared of like them finding dna on my bubblegum
[18677.49s -> 18689.38s]  Oh, he would maybe some of you guys weren't here earlier
[18689.78s -> 18700.32s]  The doctor screamed in my face one time right before I went under what the fuck
[18705.84s -> 18711.36s]  What no, that's so bad. That's not really did that really happen?
[18716.30s -> 18718.94s]  The last time I was under conscious sedation. I was
[18719.90s -> 18721.66s]  I got my wisdom teeth up
[18721.66s -> 18725.47s]  And it was really fucked up
[18725.47s -> 18727.47s]  It was fucking weird, man
[18728.59s -> 18730.51s]  I was lying in the chair and I remember just like
[18731.23s -> 18733.23s]  Hearing the same sound
[18733.23s -> 18738.99s]  Go and don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't he was playing music on a radio and it was just
[18739.31s -> 18742.27s]  I could hear a loop of the last thing that was said it was just like
[18743.15s -> 18745.55s]  And it ended and then we we we we we we we did
[18747.63s -> 18749.63s]  It was just that I could hear it over and over again
[18749.95s -> 18752.13s]  And then I said out loud
[18752.45s -> 18757.01s]  Do people say funny things on this and the dentist said stop talking
[18757.73s -> 18759.81s]  And then I started laughing and then I that's all I remember
[18760.29s -> 18772.35s]  I had my wisdom teeth. Yeah
[18772.35s -> 18774.35s]  I hate that. I hate it
[18776.19s -> 18778.19s]  I know some people are really into the whole
[18779.31s -> 18784.35s]  Oh, man. Yeah, you get a psychedelic man. Like the walls are breathing
[18785.07s -> 18790.83s]  No, no, no, no, I want the walls to stay firm and and not collapse and I want them to not breathe at all
[18794.90s -> 18799.14s]  I love just sinking down like when I love that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no
[18800.10s -> 18809.86s]  Are we getting kicked off? No, we're good. The walls got him
[18813.22s -> 18816.82s]  I'm very I like I need to be very very close to reality
[18818.05s -> 18820.53s]  Otherwise, I feel like i've just I would lose my mind
[18821.25s -> 18833.25s]  There's a difference between a hallucinogenics and sedation. I know I know i'm but i'm just saying
[18834.29s -> 18836.91s]  I don't I would probably hate it
[18836.99s -> 18839.07s]  Just because when I get put on a drug
[18842.42s -> 18847.78s]  I I like don't want to be on it. So i'm sitting there while I hear like the same sound play 10 times
[18848.50s -> 18853.06s]  and like the walls start to move around and I start to put my head back and i'm just like
[18856.69s -> 18860.05s]  I I want to go out of here. I want to go home
[18860.93s -> 18863.73s]  That's why i'm like, I don't want sedation and they're like you're fucking stupid
[18874.02s -> 18886.35s]  But we'll see don't play yourself like that sedation isn't a bad thing. No, I know I know
[18891.74s -> 18893.74s]  Just get sedated to deal with the sedation
[18894.30s -> 18901.79s]  I'm not nervous about going under but i'm nervous about the idea of being in that loopy state
[18902.03s -> 18906.19s]  All the videos out there are people getting their wisdom teeth removed and worry what I might say
[18907.15s -> 18916.02s]  Yeah, I don't know man like I might wake up and start saying passwords, you know, like I don't fucking know
[18916.66s -> 18925.42s]  I would be the worst person to be on a truth serum. I would just say I would just tell you everything
[18925.82s -> 18939.14s]  You'll just save reddit
[18944.00s -> 18945.76s]  Reddit
[18945.76s -> 18947.86s]  Reddit I want to go to reddit
[18953.42s -> 18956.30s]  And I feel like if you sit around and you here's the thing
[18957.10s -> 18960.70s]  If i'm sitting there and i'm on those drugs and i'm going to tell myself over and over again
[18960.94s -> 18965.66s]  Don't say anything. Don't say anything fucking stupid. Don't say anything crazy. Just be normal. You can do it
[18965.74s -> 18969.10s]  You could do this. You can be normal. I feel like the outside perspective is like
[18970.48s -> 18975.70s]  I'm not saying anything normal and i'm being insane. I'm not going to start streaming
[18976.26s -> 18978.76s]  No, i'm going to be under close supervision
[18990.21s -> 18992.21s]  Nope, no cameras are allowed
[18992.61s -> 18994.61s]  I ain't having anybody fill me
[18996.59s -> 18998.19s]  After i'm coming up
[18998.19s -> 19003.01s]  Mm-hmm. I i'm not gonna happen. They're gonna get all my passwords
[19011.70s -> 19019.41s]  That would be gold
[19019.41s -> 19024.64s]  record
[19024.64s -> 19026.40s]  But let's keep going
[19026.40s -> 19028.00s]  I've said my piece
[19028.00s -> 19030.00s]  But yes, it is is happening next week
[19030.40s -> 19034.82s]  Prime opportunity to bump my stocks
[19035.30s -> 19038.98s]  Uh, thank you to big buddy. Thank you big buddy for the 10 bucks
[19039.62s -> 19043.42s]  Germa flips houses on stream germa old
[19044.14s -> 19047.66s]  Flipping houses is kind of like a boomer activity, isn't it?
[19048.46s -> 19051.10s]  No, there are some like millennials and zoomers that are into that
[19051.82s -> 19055.57s]  They're just not doing it on tv on four different networks
[19061.12s -> 19063.28s]  Thank you zach the sloth for the five dollars
[19064.00s -> 19068.03s]  Hey germa, i'm sitting outside watching you stream and enjoying the warm weather
[19068.51s -> 19070.59s]  When you first made that loud sound with the hammer
[19070.59s -> 19076.43s]  I shit my pants and shouted by phone on the pavement, but don't worry. It wasn't your stream's fault. It was my
[19077.07s -> 19079.07s]  ass fault
[19080.94s -> 19087.18s]  Yeah, I mean it was
[19087.18s -> 19093.42s]  Thank you to sticks renegade for the two dollars and 55 cents. Did somebody say 40 bumper stickers?
[19096.32s -> 19098.32s]  Yeah, this is yeah, but just everywhere
[19104.29s -> 19106.53s]  Bumper stick is the thing he's like about bumper stickers, right?

[19112.29s -> 19113.65s]  four
[19113.65s -> 19116.05s]  At some point they kind of just look like cars zits

[19129.86s -> 19132.14s]  a hundred

[19268.45s -> 19272.53s]  You can honestly you can tell a lot about somebody who has car stickers
[19273.25s -> 19278.10s]  How do you get those off?
[19278.10s -> 19280.10s]  If you peel those off does paint come with it?

[19471.44s -> 19478.48s]  So, thank you and especially thank you the 10 dollars
[19479.04s -> 19484.50s]  Really appreciate that. They never said they watched for that long. What?
[19486.30s -> 19488.70s]  They said thank you for nearly a decade of content
[19489.34s -> 19492.99s]  What do you mean? They didn't tell me how long
[19492.99s -> 19495.92s]  They said a decade that's 10 years

[19526.90s -> 19528.90s]  Our conversation went to streamers
[19529.62s -> 19536.34s]  She made a comment about lady streamers. I mentioned how you sometimes don't wear clothes and stream in a bathrobe
[19537.63s -> 19541.55s]  Anyway, moral of the story is that she was actually interested in me rambling about you, which is cool
[19542.03s -> 19545.71s]  I think she's a keeper. Well, that's all smooches. Enjoy the money. You silly willy
[19547.74s -> 19549.87s]  well
[19549.87s -> 19552.99s]  What you told her about me is factually correct statements
[19554.91s -> 19556.59s]  I do stream
[19556.59s -> 19561.06s]  Without clothes on I don't have a camera on but I do sit here
[19562.66s -> 19566.82s]  As just me as the day I was born. No, I don't that's a lie
[19567.38s -> 19570.10s]  I don't sit here naked. How would I do that?
[19570.66s -> 19572.66s]  There's other people that like live in this house
[19574.82s -> 19577.06s]  That's kind of weird. No, I don't do that
[19583.86s -> 19588.22s]  You fucking imagine how much of a weird motherfucker you have to be
[19589.10s -> 19591.74s]  To when I broadcast I just broadcast
[19592.36s -> 19598.78s]  Naked
[19598.78s -> 19602.70s]  No, I I always i'm pretty much shirtless every moment of the day unless i'm
[19603.34s -> 19605.34s]  Driving around somewhere we could go somewhere
[19605.98s -> 19616.75s]  Hey after what was that? He's like, hey, we gotta go do it as a joke
[19621.36s -> 19623.36s]  uh, but glad to hear that you're
[19624.24s -> 19626.24s]  Might be having a potential
[19626.99s -> 19629.79s]  uh getting a new
[19629.79s -> 19632.75s]  Friendship into a maybe a relationship. I don't know whatever you're doing here
[19635.87s -> 19638.11s]  Uh, wish you both luck. Hopefully you guys, uh
[19638.91s -> 19641.78s]  Talk about more street if I talk about me some more, you know
[19642.34s -> 19644.34s]  I'm a topic of conversation talk about me
[19644.98s -> 19654.08s]  But thank you
[19654.08s -> 19656.08s]  Uh, thank you too
[19657.63s -> 19660.67s]  Uh raslik corgon for the five dolls
[19661.47s -> 19666.11s]  Hey jerma, i'm thinking about jumping into the world of streaming even if I get just 10 viewers think it'll be a blast
[19666.83s -> 19671.57s]  Any advice you're willing to share?
[19671.57s -> 19673.57s]  You are you're already on the right track
[19673.57s -> 19678.08s]  Do it because you want to do it because you think it'll be fun
[19680.00s -> 19682.00s]  You already got the right, uh mindset so
[19683.28s -> 19688.85s]  Give it a try
[19688.85s -> 19697.76s]  You got step one
[19697.76s -> 19703.46s]  Take sure no
[19703.86s -> 19705.86s]  The thing is people ask me advice for streaming
[19707.62s -> 19709.76s]  but
[19709.76s -> 19711.76s]  I don't know what the fuck i'm doing
[19717.44s -> 19722.18s]  At all
[19722.18s -> 19724.18s]  I don't even know how to turn the stream on sometimes
[19731.07s -> 19734.61s]  We know
[19734.61s -> 19740.05s]  No, but in all honestly it
[19740.05s -> 19741.65s]  There's no real
[19741.65s -> 19743.73s]  There's no real blanket advice that's possible to give
[19745.22s -> 19751.86s]  Just because of the nature of the platform it's it's a bunch think about what the platform is right twitch.tv or any streaming platform even youtube
[19751.86s -> 19754.00s]  You can add this together
[19754.00s -> 19755.20s]  You have
[19755.20s -> 19759.84s]  A bunch of people who are all streaming right right now. There's a bunch of oh, well, can you hear me?
[19760.32s -> 19761.84s]  Or did we lose?
[19761.84s -> 19766.66s]  I think we're good
[19766.66s -> 19770.90s]  uh, what I was saying is you have a bunch of people that are doing this sort of thing at the same time
[19772.72s -> 19773.68s]  and
[19773.68s -> 19775.04s]  trying to
[19775.20s -> 19780.96s]  Maneuver your way around and find some kind of audience or some people that would be fun to hang around with or
[19781.60s -> 19783.60s]  Some people that you want to stream to
[19784.16s -> 19787.36s]  You kind of have to make your own brand right make your own
[19788.64s -> 19790.64s]  Um way that you know how
[19790.96s -> 19794.35s]  Because there are a lot of ways to do it
[19795.65s -> 19799.09s]  You know, are you really good at something like a video game? Are you like top?
[19799.65s -> 19806.61s]  10 percentile in a particular game. That's a that's worth watching. Can you do something really fast? That's worth watching
[19807.25s -> 19811.73s]  Can you make like jokes do people think that you're funny and that's worth watching right?
[19812.61s -> 19815.89s]  There's a lot of avenues that you can go down to start a stream
[19824.59s -> 19828.59s]  So what might be right for you or right? What what might be right for me?
[19829.63s -> 19836.06s]  Um might not be the same for anybody else because I really don't have a way to
[19836.70s -> 19840.86s]  Here's what you need to do step one step two step three because I I don't know. I really don't know
[19842.93s -> 19845.25s]  Just try to do something and try to do something that you're good at
[19846.32s -> 19863.18s]  And see what happens did this internet kill the stream? No, we were we were teetering around for a little bit
[19863.18s -> 19872.37s]  It was still okay
[19872.37s -> 19876.85s]  People shouldn't go into something with the brand in mind. No, no, but that's not what I mean by that is
[19879.74s -> 19882.06s]  You just kind of have to do whatever you want to do
[19884.83s -> 19888.51s]  Most of the people that started doing this just did it because they felt like doing it one day
[19890.43s -> 19895.79s]  And it was just I want to make a video. I'm just gonna make it and i'm gonna put it up
[19896.51s -> 19899.55s]  Did anybody watch my first five videos no
[19901.74s -> 19903.74s]  My first 10 videos, maybe a few
[19904.67s -> 19907.55s]  I just kept doing it because I just was having a great time
[19908.19s -> 19910.19s]  I was just having a lot of fun
[19910.35s -> 19913.26s]  Making a video
[19913.26s -> 19917.50s]  And in the initial stages it was it was almost to see if I could even do it in the first place
[19930.10s -> 19933.44s]  We all watched germa craft. Yeah, but that was
[19934.53s -> 19939.66s]  That was like 50 videos in I knew what I was doing at that point. I had everything figured out
[19940.46s -> 19945.65s]  But I wish you the best of luck I
[19945.89s -> 19947.89s]  I wish there was more advice I could give
[19947.97s -> 19950.98s]  But I don't really have any
[19950.98s -> 19961.22s]  If i'm completely honest
[19961.22s -> 19966.00s]  Germa craft was the pinnacle. I disagree, but that's okay
[19973.94s -> 19975.94s]  You've seen me in the servers
[19976.26s -> 19979.23s]  What's the best video you think you ever made? I mean that's kind of
[19980.03s -> 19982.08s]  That's very skewed
[19982.08s -> 19988.43s]  I made a germa rumble live action was just that's probably the best video and it's like the last video I ever made
[19989.31s -> 19994.54s]  Maybe castle griffin steed just like put a lot of time into them
[19995.18s -> 19997.73s]  Thought they were a lot of fun to make
[19997.73s -> 20007.86s]  I have a lot of videos that I remember very very fondly
[20009.06s -> 20016.61s]  What video embarrasses you to think about?
[20017.81s -> 20019.81s]  every modern warfare 3 video
[20019.97s -> 20023.28s]  I actually uploaded a video that was a 14 and 7
[20024.32s -> 20028.56s]  Kill confirmed gameplay and I thought that that was a good I thought that was it at the time
[20029.12s -> 20033.52s]  That was okay to upload for me. It was like yeah, this is this is good. I'm gonna I'll upload that
[20036.35s -> 20038.91s]  14 and 7 kill confirmed and I thought it was yeah
[20040.53s -> 20045.65s]  But this is listen. This is back before let me i'm gonna go off on a little thing here. This is back before
[20047.21s -> 20049.31s]  Esports was really took off
[20050.96s -> 20055.28s]  And people were really good and all like the best players were coming out and and and being
[20055.76s -> 20060.40s]  Noticed and and good gameplay really good gameplay was something that was sought after at that point
[20061.28s -> 20063.52s]  This is like 2011 2012
[20068.11s -> 20069.31s]  I used to make
[20069.31s -> 20071.63s]  Tip videos on how to play the scout
[20085.09s -> 20088.93s]  The heart defended your iphone game video saying that you were genuine casual
[20090.59s -> 20093.63s]  Yeah, playing iphone games in bed is not the same of
[20094.75s -> 20099.84s]  You know what I mean?
[20099.84s -> 20101.46s]  but yeah
[20101.46s -> 20103.46s]  Being really good at a video game
[20104.02s -> 20106.74s]  Really started to take off like just about five years ago
[20107.70s -> 20112.34s]  All the esports teams started to really form and started to make teams started to compete
[20113.14s -> 20116.12s]  Money real big money started to get involved in competitions
[20121.16s -> 20125.88s]  That was like 2012 2013 is when that really started
[20134.39s -> 20135.27s]  but
[20135.27s -> 20145.62s]  It's an interesting space. We're in it was way earlier than that
[20147.92s -> 20149.52s]  Yeah, but
[20149.52s -> 20152.72s]  I mean, I don't know because think about like even like youtube
[20154.27s -> 20156.27s]  2010 2011
[20157.30s -> 20162.50s]  That was like the call of duty youtubers were just starting to really be popular and
[20164.50s -> 20166.72s]  Esports hadn't really
[20166.72s -> 20171.28s]  Taken off that much online entertainment for video games hadn't really
[20172.00s -> 20174.00s]  It was just starting to happen
[20174.08s -> 20180.68s]  back in like 2008
[20180.90s -> 20186.52s]  2007 2008 2009 you would get your channel deleted if you uploaded video game
[20187.24s -> 20188.36s]  footage
[20188.36s -> 20191.08s]  Like straight up your channel is terminated
[20191.81s -> 20194.21s]  back in like 2000 before like 2010
[20194.85s -> 20208.40s]  Somewhere in like the 2005 2006 2007 when they really started to introduce all that stuff
[20211.72s -> 20213.56s]  Yeah, they i'm like
[20213.56s -> 20217.24s]  I think there was specific cases of people uploading gta 4 footage
[20218.34s -> 20220.50s]  And just it just been instantly removed
[20227.41s -> 20231.57s]  Yeah, this is but you couldn't even upload videos longer than 10 minutes. Yeah, it was crazy
[20238.74s -> 20245.84s]  2010 is the year that online video game media really was starting to take off
[20254.93s -> 20257.41s]  Yeah, you used to have to get approved for 15 minute videos
[20263.62s -> 20265.62s]  Video responses. Oh, yeah
[20267.17s -> 20270.45s]  Yeah
[20270.45s -> 20275.91s]  You might think that that's a long time ago. That's not that long ago that really I mean like 2010 2011
[20276.77s -> 20278.77s]  That's less than 10 years ago
[20278.77s -> 20290.15s]  I mean, it's not like it was like 20 years ago or something. It was really like eight-ish plus years ago almost
[20292.42s -> 20295.62s]  You had so much hair back then. I actually had a lot less hair because I had it short
[20296.10s -> 20300.50s]  I cut my hair really short
[20300.50s -> 20302.50s]  10 years is still a good bit. Yeah, it is
[20305.16s -> 20309.48s]  But in this last 10 years, we've seen such a monumental surge
[20310.76s -> 20314.12s]  in attention to like the gaming communities the gaming world
[20316.02s -> 20317.62s]  I remember when
[20317.62s -> 20319.14s]  smite
[20319.14s -> 20324.34s]  Had that 2.6 million dollar tournament and i remember being like, holy fuck man. That's
[20325.12s -> 20326.66s]  insanity
[20326.66s -> 20334.85s]  That's crazy
[20335.25s -> 20340.45s]  There was a big dota one four or five years ago. What was the one was like 10 million bucks or something like that 10
[20341.49s -> 20343.43s]  8 million
[20343.43s -> 20345.43s]  That's when it was really like holy shit
[20346.63s -> 20349.51s]  You mean I can I can be I can make millions of dollars doing this
[20352.92s -> 20354.92s]  Yeah, when was the first international?
[20357.80s -> 20366.62s]  That'll probably give you a good indicator. I remember reading that article of the first international
[20367.62s -> 20369.62s]  Yeah, 2011 2010
[20371.80s -> 20374.68s]  The international has a price pool of 20 million dollars. Yeah, that's
[20375.16s -> 20383.33s]  It's an insane amount of money
[20383.33s -> 20393.83s]  Yeah, it's weird 18. It was not an 1800. Remember the gaming at the olympics video you called it
[20395.11s -> 20397.11s]  Yeah, people told me I was wrong
[20399.25s -> 20402.45s]  Jeremy in quotes always write 9 8 5
[20407.44s -> 20409.92s]  I'm gonna i'm gonna shave that into the back of my head
[20419.20s -> 20422.40s]  You really did have such a galaxy brain prediction though
[20427.25s -> 20434.69s]  Yeah, too bad back in like 2010 2011 2012. I was doing galaxy brain gaming
[20435.17s -> 20438.05s]  Community predictions and not like buying bitcoin
[20439.46s -> 20442.66s]  Too bad. I didn't have that kind of galaxy brain intuition, huh?
[20443.30s -> 20455.78s]  It's always good. It always goes back to crypto
[20456.26s -> 20460.21s]  All right, let's uh, we'll move on though
[20460.21s -> 20466.05s]  Good talk though. Good good talk. Very good talk. Thank you, too
[20467.28s -> 20470.32s]  Uh lobotomized teddy bear for the two dollars and 75 cents
[20471.06s -> 20474.66s]  Jerma i'm an intern at the smithsonian. One of my jobs is web maintenance
[20474.82s -> 20477.46s]  If you could not possibly crash our site, that would be great
[20478.69s -> 20485.46s]  Also do an irl gardening stream. It'd be

[21055.64s -> 21056.76s]  that
[21056.76s -> 21062.28s]  Streamers and youtubers were really pushing and showing and it was kind of a craze for a year or two
[21063.00s -> 21065.49s]  You kind of had to be there, right?
[21071.97s -> 21073.97s]  Time to get a new identity
[21074.37s -> 21081.59s]  You're just gonna be the blood box guy. Oh, no
[21083.35s -> 21087.41s]  Don't worry, like show them like a cool video. Is there a video wherever it like was cool?

[21103.92s -> 21107.44s]  Hey, look at this guy lifting weights on camera. Why would you show people that?
[21108.00s -> 21113.38s]  That'd be weird to show if we're just out of context
[21114.31s -> 21118.77s]  It's cool though
[21118.77s -> 21123.33s]  I've actually thought about this a lot before I don't believe there's any video of jerma's I could show to a friend
[21124.21s -> 21126.13s]  Me either
[21126.13s -> 21137.52s]  So we can both agree on that
