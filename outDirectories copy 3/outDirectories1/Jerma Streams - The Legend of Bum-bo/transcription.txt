[44.66s -> 48.98s]  It's popped over, I see. Roy Mustang, S tier, or Riot.
[53.16s -> 54.20s]  Do you think you're on the VOD?
[58.36s -> 61.96s]  Oh shit, I thought I was watching the VOD. He went live right when that happened.
[63.40s -> 65.24s]  So the chat turned into the live chat.
[71.66s -> 75.66s]  A new tier list. Binding of Isaac bosses. Binding of Isaac items.
[78.06s -> 87.93s]  No, no more tier lists. Sounds like a pretty good list though. It doesn't already exist.
[88.57s -> 92.60s]  That would take so long. Yeah, there wasn't like a thousand items in Binding of Isaac.
[97.37s -> 103.21s]  But speaking of Binding of Isaac, what a perfect transition to talk about what we're doing today.
[104.25s -> 111.61s]  We are going to, I was going to do this yesterday, but we spent a little more time in
[111.61s -> 117.99s]  Katamari than I would have imagined. And then we did tier lists. So this got bumped over to today.
[119.30s -> 125.62s]  We are going to play the Legend of Bumbo, which is the Binding of Isaac prequel,
[125.62s -> 131.21s]  but it's a different game. These are different games. If you think you're going to get that
[131.21s -> 137.77s]  classic Binding of Isaac gameplay, it's a little different. This is a cardboard
[138.81s -> 149.03s]  attack and defend match for video game. It's Edmund McMillan. Same guy. I trust it'll be a
[149.03s -> 163.05s]  fun experience. And everything's made out of cardboard. So this stream, I don't know how
[163.05s -> 170.33s]  long the stream is going to be. It might be a few hours. It might be seven, eight. Like, I don't
[170.33s -> 180.84s]  know. I might get really into this. I might think this is a lot of fun. I don't know. Incoming 30
[180.84s -> 186.98s]  minutes. I think it probably takes like 30 minutes to get through the tutorial. So I doubt that. But
[189.51s -> 195.21s]  something else to talk about very quickly before we move on with this. I just preliminarily started
[195.85s -> 202.73s]  to really start to put the resources in and truly develop the fuck the King streams.
[204.50s -> 210.22s]  They're going to be way more elaborate than I think anybody thinks. We're talking multiple
[210.22s -> 218.28s]  camera angles. We're talking about multiple observer views. The King streams are now actively
[218.28s -> 228.86s]  being started now. No spoilers. You're going to have to know how this works though, as we get closer
[229.66s -> 236.92s]  because there's, you guys need to participate in this stream. I can't just be like two days
[236.92s -> 240.04s]  before the stream starts and go, oh, hey, by the way, here's the server info.
[241.48s -> 244.52s]  No, this is going to be all kinds of systems that need to be talked about beforehand.
[245.32s -> 254.60s]  This will probably be happening a couple weeks after the new green screen stream,
[254.60s -> 261.24s]  which the new green screen stream, by the way, will probably end up being on date to be determined
[261.24s -> 266.86s]  the first week of December. I have to lock that down. I have to get the date locked down
[266.86s -> 271.34s]  with the green screen. So that means that there's, I was, I'm kind of waiting.
[272.14s -> 278.46s]  I was waiting a little bit for when I could know I could get in there on a given day to the studio
[279.02s -> 285.85s]  before I actually had the discussion board up. So it'll be probably a week or two after the green
[285.85s -> 293.62s]  screen stream. So probably mid December. And it's going to be potentially a weekly thing that we do,
[293.62s -> 298.41s]  maybe even more than once a week. Depends on how fun it is. There you go. There's your timeline.
[300.92s -> 306.60s]  So we're going to move to Bumbo. I have not, I've opened the game once to make sure that I can
[306.60s -> 316.47s]  capture it. What's he talking about? I will give way more details when, when stuff actually starts
[316.47s -> 321.59s]  to glue together. But December is going to have some fun streams in it. Let's just say that
[322.23s -> 336.86s]  anyways. Time for Bumbo. Let's watch the opening cinematic. Hopefully it's not too loud. It's
[336.86s -> 339.35s]  actually very soft.
[373.35s -> 409.40s]  I loved it. Bumbo take trash downstairs. Dermal want bits. All right. So this is how
[409.40s -> 415.56s]  teaching this tutorial. Hit me with some bones kid. I'll give you one move point. Use it to line up
[415.56s -> 427.50s]  four bones, then throw that bone my way. I think we know what we didn't know. Four bones. Throw it
[427.50s -> 439.00s]  where? So throw it right down the middle. Cool. Thanks. I needed that, but I need more. I'll give
[439.00s -> 444.68s]  you two more points this time, but I want you to line up five teeth and throw them straight into
[444.68s -> 462.15s]  my kisser. Bumbo make that. Throw teeth down. Okay. Wow. That packed punch teeth and bones
[462.15s -> 467.27s]  both hurt bad when thrown and the more tiles you match up, the more impact they make.
[467.91s -> 474.79s]  Experiment with tile combos. So if I get two lines, it's like teeth and bone.
[477.86s -> 491.06s]  Do I get to throw two? Oh, you're going to go twice. Okay. He's dead. Hey again. Now it's time
[491.06s -> 499.96s]  for me to hit you. Okay. I'm going to hit you. Whatever you do, don't match four booger tiles
[499.96s -> 517.88s]  and gum me up. Stun? You gummed up the works there, didn't you? Boogers only stop one action
[517.88s -> 526.55s]  by an enemy. So be careful. Here I come again. Uh oh. So wait. Oh no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[526.55s -> 533.26s]  How do I cancel that? So here he comes again. So I can't do anything. I guess I could go like this.
[534.22s -> 545.98s]  This is another turn. No, okay. I can do it. Throw poop at him. Oof. I just punched a darn poop. How
[545.98s -> 551.18s]  do you know how to do that? Oh yeah. Poops can shield you from one single enemy attack, but you
[551.18s -> 561.30s]  know that already. Okay. Now just finish me off and I'll give you a little treat. So I get two moves.
[561.30s -> 581.74s]  So should I pee on him? Plus one move. I get it. All right. Uh oh. Now just finish me off.
[583.72s -> 593.53s]  Do they have to be in a row? Or can I just like drag? It's going to be like, okay, it'd be like a
[593.53s -> 616.30s]  row. Uh oh. I did this wrong. Diagonal don't work. Okay. I'll take the money. Yep. Me again. Wow. I
[616.30s -> 626.78s]  really gave you a run for your money there, didn't I? You should probably heal a bit. Let me just do
[626.78s -> 631.26s]  heal. Okay. This is my health. All right. Hearts are a lot less common than other tiles, so don't
[631.26s -> 639.56s]  get used to healing so easily. This reminds me of 10 million, but potentially much more interesting
[639.56s -> 642.44s]  for one reason, because apparently there are like hundreds of items in the game.
[643.24s -> 650.50s]  Okay. It's time to get crazy now. See, each tile you match actually gives you specific colored
[650.50s -> 659.19s]  mana that you can use to cast spells. Crazy, huh? Here, take this. Okay. So I have bumbo smash.
[661.51s -> 666.79s]  Take- that spell takes bone mana to use, so just match some bones and when it lights up,
[666.79s -> 685.24s]  click on it and knock my face off. Spell's ready. Okay. So this is called bumbo smash.
[690.62s -> 695.74s]  Oh, I just knocked his body off. Okay. I think you are ready for a real battle, dude. Before you go,
[695.74s -> 702.60s]  let me give you a few tips. You can visit the casino. Best game ever! Best game ever! Best game
[702.60s -> 709.53s]  ever! After each boss, they'll save those coins. Bosses usually have more than one action a turn,
[709.53s -> 723.77s]  so be careful. All right. I think I'm- I think I get the basics down. Bumbo want coin, the legend
[723.77s -> 740.70s]  of bumbo. New game. Choose your bumbo. Bumbo the brave. Bumbo the nimble. Bumbo the stout. Bumbo
[740.70s -> 747.14s]  the weird. Bumbo the dead. Bumbo the empty. Beat the game twice with all characters. What are these
[747.14s -> 751.78s]  ones? Beat chapter one with Bumbo the brave. Beat chapter two with Bumbo the nimble. Okay.
[752.66s -> 759.75s]  So this is the lower his health, the harder he hits. This is just standard like Isaac. So
[759.75s -> 766.23s]  Bumbo smashes four bones and then Bumbo shake his two teeth. Rerolls the puzzle board.
[774.20s -> 787.66s]  Sewers of Dros? Bumbo the furry. Hey Jeremy, you got a nice looking bum. Thanks. All right,
[787.66s -> 794.97s]  here we go. Oh, shit. This is a lot. All right. Boogers. Uh oh. All right. Let's start off with,
[796.01s -> 803.26s]  huh. What do I want to do here first? I'm just going to do boogers. No, I got- is it four? Okay,
[803.26s -> 811.19s]  I get another move. What do I want to go, right down the middle? I'm going to go right down the
[811.19s -> 825.05s]  middle. End your turn. Spell is ready. Bumbo smash right in the middle. Oh, they move. Okay. So now
[825.45s -> 836.97s]  my turn again. Maybe boogers. P? Boogers? I'm going to booger. Booger on, uh, booger on middle.
[841.70s -> 855.26s]  And then teeth on right. Oh, shit. He broke out. Right here. You're about to attack.
[858.92s -> 868.34s]  Reroll the puzzle board. I don't think I need to do that. Uh, let's see. No one's about to attack
[868.34s -> 881.40s]  and I have one move left. So let me go. Should I do P? Can I get P without? Let me see. Uh oh.
[881.40s -> 888.44s]  Wait. Fuck. I'm going to take damage, I think. Not quite. They're about to. What does P do?
[891.30s -> 899.64s]  Oh, P gives me more turns. Right. Okay. Got it. Got it. All right. Uh, I'm going to booger
[899.64s -> 919.42s]  right here. One turn left. Can I kill it? No. Is there poop available? There is. Right here.
[925.32s -> 937.74s]  All right. I'm ready. Good. Okay. This is fun. Okay. This is a fun one. I'm going teeth. Teeth
[937.74s -> 950.12s]  on the left. No. Yeah. Teeth on the left. And then in turn, it's going to queue up.
[951.08s -> 953.64s]  All right. I got two turns to kill this thing. I got it right here.
[963.59s -> 973.72s]  Free coins. Uh, what is this? This is a item. Snot rocket is a booger, a booger lane,
[973.72s -> 984.18s]  a navy beam. Destroy a column of tiles. This is four, four, two. That seems like a lot.
[988.17s -> 998.28s]  All right. I got the booger lane. I need to get four, then four, and then two P's. All right.
[998.28s -> 1002.76s]  Let me see what I want to do here. Snot rocket. Yeah. All right. I'm going to go.
[1006.55s -> 1012.31s]  I can do just bone immediately. Does that set me up for anything after that? Fuck it. Whatever.
[1012.31s -> 1023.42s]  This is wicked. And then no, not Bumbo smash. I could do teeth right down the middle. Bumbo
[1023.42s -> 1038.71s]  smash right down the middle. All right. Middle lane gone. This board's good. I'll keep it.
[1040.09s -> 1053.58s]  Oh shit. They've ranged. Those guys are ranged. Uh oh. Wait, hold on. That's three and then I
[1053.58s -> 1084.09s]  could do poo, but do this. Fuck. He's going to attack. Does this take up the whole lane?
[1085.77s -> 1090.68s]  I'm going to, I'm curious. Let me see if this works. Like if he attacks, will it hit that?
[1091.72s -> 1098.39s]  Yep. Oh, cool. All right. Cool. Very cool. I got it. Well, now I'm in trouble again.
[1099.11s -> 1107.42s]  I don't have enough. Do I have a P scenario? I could do five booger. I could booger this whole
[1107.42s -> 1112.87s]  lane. I'm going to booger this lane. And then I'm going to do a super booger on the,
[1115.83s -> 1129.24s]  like right over here. This is five boogers. I can do it twice. Let's go. Okay.
[1129.80s -> 1140.15s]  Now I got to start killing shit. I could do, I've got bones here. I could do bone.
[1144.09s -> 1147.61s]  Dammit. All right. Wait, hear me out on this one. Hear me out on this. This is stupid,
[1147.61s -> 1152.70s]  but I'm going to do it. That's six bones. How many throws is that?
[1158.07s -> 1172.18s]  Two, three. Oh shit. That's actually a really good idea. Now I can just bumbo smash him.
[1175.62s -> 1185.02s]  Yeah. Still. Do I like this board? What do you guys think? Seven is a super combo.
[1189.67s -> 1198.79s]  Nana drain. What the hell was that? I got teeth and I got bone here. I wish I could split this
[1198.79s -> 1209.74s]  up, but I'll do teeth and then I'll do bone. No bone and then teeth. How much damage does the
[1209.74s -> 1233.13s]  bone do? It's only one damage, right? Yeah. Kill it. Let's go. New item coming up.
[1237.14s -> 1246.44s]  All right. Flying insects. What do they do? I'm assuming they just keep going forward.
[1253.27s -> 1258.70s]  What does this mean up here? Does this just nothing or does what does this mean?
[1259.34s -> 1265.83s]  It's what falls down after. Okay. This comes next like Tetris style. I get it.
[1265.83s -> 1281.50s]  All right. We're going to booger. Booger. I wait. Can I do P too? Booger. All right. Hold on. Watch
[1281.50s -> 1295.53s]  this. Kind of. That was pointless. I thought I was going to give more turns to like then do this.
[1295.53s -> 1303.62s]  It's all right. I'm sorry. You're going to make a mistake once or many times. How do I salvage
[1303.62s -> 1311.26s]  this? I just fucked a seven bone. God damn it. Whatever. I'm just going to line up these bones
[1311.26s -> 1320.12s]  here. No one's doing anything yet. Let's go right down the middle. Wait. Let me make sure.
[1327.24s -> 1331.70s]  Okay. You go up top first. Bone smash. I wonder if now save it. Don't use it.
[1332.50s -> 1337.64s]  Do I have anything else to do? No boogers are in the wrong spot.
[1339.08s -> 1354.09s]  I wonder if these guys, they attack or is it just that they get close enough to hurt you?
[1360.66s -> 1368.54s]  Six boogers is an AOE. I don't want to reroll this yet. Uh oh. Okay. Now
[1372.12s -> 1383.21s]  I need to make some poos. One, two. What if I set up like a whole row? You need
[1383.21s -> 1392.74s]  seven for AOE. Damn it. I could do one. I could do this and then poo. Let's see if this helps me
[1392.74s -> 1406.78s]  at all. I'm not sure where to go with it though. Kind of playing defense. And then how about right
[1406.78s -> 1422.73s]  here? And then I'm going to kill this with bubble smash. Okay. I can booger the lane next. All right.
[1422.73s -> 1435.06s]  You're about to go. I'm going to keep that there. So cool. All right. So they don't attack. They just,
[1435.70s -> 1442.76s]  you don't, you do not take damage unless this pops up, right? This is like that you're about
[1442.76s -> 1451.99s]  to take damage. It's not just, they just walk forward and hit you, right? Oh, we got a bone here.
[1454.66s -> 1462.62s]  Wait, let's see. I could do bone and then smash. Yeah, let's just bone it.
[1468.15s -> 1476.33s]  And then smash right down the middle. Oh shit. It's, it's in the air. Uh oh. All right. I'll
[1476.33s -> 1484.62s]  booger this whole lane. Whoa. What just happened? What? Why did that do damage?
[1491.53s -> 1501.50s]  Oh hell, they had, oh it was poo shields. Oh fuck. Oh no. Okay. I get it. So they,
[1501.50s -> 1514.06s]  that was poo shields for the, I get it. Damn it. That's cool. Well, I got an opportunity here at
[1514.06s -> 1522.23s]  this. I might reroll this. No, I don't have to. Teeth and then just, I'm going to wait it out.
[1529.91s -> 1559.40s]  Yeah. You're going to run into that and I'll be fine. Heal. Did I just poop that? I could do an
[1559.40s -> 1576.38s]  extra. Oh, cool. All right. Uh, here, we'll take that. Wait, I can do a super poo. Hold on
[1576.38s -> 1584.15s]  everybody. I could do this. I could go, I could do, what does five poos do? No, no, no. What is
[1584.15s -> 1601.22s]  six poos? Holy shit. Could I get a huge one? I could do six poos. I'll just do five. Just
[1601.22s -> 1620.92s]  going to see what happens. The stars. Oh, it's wild. That's cool. Wild. Ooh. Well, I can,
[1620.92s -> 1638.09s]  what is, I can do a big heal. Spell ready. No. Oh, all right. Let's just go. I'm going to do five
[1638.09s -> 1652.06s]  bones. No, I'm not. I even do four right now. This looks pretty neat to be honest. It is. It
[1652.06s -> 1668.18s]  actually is pretty cool. That's what I like to see. And I can bumble a smash. Does this
[1668.18s -> 1683.59s]  save between floors? I can hold. Is this? No, they didn't. No. Okay. Okay. Eight coins. Ooh.
[1686.17s -> 1697.66s]  Plus one movement or trap door. Skip to next chapter. I don't want to skip. This is the first
[1697.66s -> 1707.00s]  time. This is my first game. Let's take the juice. Bumbo versus peeper. His eyes are slippery.
[1710.66s -> 1724.92s]  15 health. Oh fuck. Okay. So I can do, I'd probably have to freeze them. We'll slow them.
[1725.56s -> 1739.27s]  I wonder if I should just try to damage. Cause I could do one bone. I could do bone and then
[1739.27s -> 1751.88s]  movement. Check this. Wait, do they have health? Should I attack him? I'm going for him. Now check
[1751.88s -> 1777.90s]  this out. One movement. Bingo. Sticky on you. I guess. Oh, can I stick? I could have stick that,
[1778.78s -> 1789.85s]  but they would have been blocked anyways. All right. Thank you. This is not good. I could do
[1789.85s -> 1803.05s]  teeth, but can I even hit you? This is just resisted, but these don't take any damage.
[1803.05s -> 1811.70s]  Okay. So the plays you got to stick these sticky sticky and then hit them or move them by swinging
[1811.70s -> 1822.49s]  out. Okay. He doesn't move though. Well, let's see what happens. Oh, this is not good. I need poo
[1823.37s -> 1831.86s]  right now. Right? Oh, I need two poos. I'm going to get hit. Can I get an extra turn out of this?
[1839.00s -> 1851.05s]  Yes. Yes. That was poo and a extra move. All right. Oh, look at all these moves. Okay. This is
[1851.05s -> 1860.41s]  important. I don't want to fuck this up, but I'm going to. I could do booger over here. I could do
[1860.41s -> 1876.34s]  super poo, but that's not going to help me. Does it stack? Oh, shit. Will this poo stack? See,
[1876.34s -> 1892.52s]  that's just one. Let's try it. Oh, yes, it does. It does stack. Nice. All right. Then, oh, look at
[1892.52s -> 1898.60s]  that. Look at that. I could do five bones. Boy, I could do more than that. I could do six bones.
[1899.32s -> 1910.97s]  Wait, don't do that. Cause that's four. I, but I can't hit them. No, I'm not going to do it. Can
[1910.97s -> 1917.27s]  I just end the turn? I could do an extra turn, but will that help me? Big bones? I don't, I,
[1917.27s -> 1923.64s]  maybe I should move the bone down. Wait, wait, wait. How many turns do I have? No, I can't hit
[1923.64s -> 1936.15s]  them. Okay. What if I do this? Put this here or should I move? Fuck. I'm going to put this here
[1938.31s -> 1948.46s]  and then go for seven. I don't, I don't think I'm too slow for that. Do seven teeth. One, two, three,
[1948.46s -> 1954.97s]  four, five, six. I could go. All right. If this is wrong, it's wrong. If it's wrong, I'm stupid
[1954.97s -> 1961.29s]  and I messed it up, but you got to mess up at least once. Ready? One, two, three, four, five, six.
[1962.41s -> 1975.29s]  This is going to be, oh, I fucked it up. I was going to try to go for six bones. I fucked it up
[1975.29s -> 1981.34s]  because the whole thing. No, no, wait a minute. No, I didn't. I can still do it. I can get it.
[1983.02s -> 1991.35s]  One, two, three, four, five. I'll have six. Okay. I'll have six bones. Maybe more. Seven.
[1992.15s -> 2000.36s]  I got to move this out of the way though. All right. Here's the game plan. You ready?
[2001.48s -> 2008.31s]  Throw teeth, move that out of the way. Uh, fuck. This whole thing is messed up. Um,
[2009.42s -> 2019.53s]  I'm going to connect four anyways. Well, I'm uh, damn it. I'm set. So I can't do seven teeth
[2020.25s -> 2026.62s]  because if I go up from here, I'm going to connect. Hold on because that's four.
[2028.23s -> 2037.53s]  This is four. Can I go over? Can I do this? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2037.53s -> 2051.38s]  Okay. Hold on. Yes. I'm doing teeth. No, I'm doing bones. Seven. So if I go this way.
[2052.44s -> 2058.12s]  All right. All right. All right. So you saying bang right here, then bring it up to make three,
[2058.12s -> 2071.72s]  then bring the wild down to make seven. I mean, no teeth, not bones. We're talking about that.
[2071.72s -> 2077.08s]  Isn't that, that's not correct. That's going to take too long. Slide the third from the top to
[2077.08s -> 2099.24s]  the left third row left. I think you mean like right here and then just go up and then down.
[2099.24s -> 2107.94s]  But then I'm going to connect. You mean like this? I see what you're saying. You guys are
[2107.94s -> 2120.98s]  fucking pretty good. Well, my way would have done it too. Yeah. My way would have done it.
[2126.79s -> 2137.00s]  Perfect. Our way is better. All right. Here we go. One, two, three, four, five, six, 17.
[2139.77s -> 2155.82s]  All right. It does four damage to everything. Okay. That's cool. I guess I could go. Let me see.
[2155.82s -> 2176.52s]  I could just booger the lane. Try to get the extra turn and get a little move and I'm going to go
[2176.52s -> 2188.18s]  here. Give me a, uh, I probably shouldn't have even done that. But I don't know why I did that.
[2188.74s -> 2200.52s]  I saw one guy. All right. So we got one. Can I do a seven bone? One, two, three,
[2200.52s -> 2211.96s]  hold on. One, two, three, four. Okay. Down. All right. Here we go. You're ready? I'm going to set
[2211.96s -> 2218.63s]  up the seven bone scenario. That'd be one, two, three, four, five, six. Okay. I'm setting up the
[2218.63s -> 2240.57s]  seven bone. Let me make sure it is right. Then two, wait, and then, okay, let's do it.
[2241.45s -> 2261.56s]  Should I do this now? Because they're walking away. What does it do? Oh, I just fucking destroyed.
[2262.20s -> 2270.50s]  Holy shit. That's the best thing in the whole game. How much damage does that do?
[2284.06s -> 2293.66s]  Weird box in back of room. What in there? Bumble stink. Spider with long bite, big long bone,
[2294.38s -> 2303.02s]  bees with magic powers. It a mystery with no thinking. Bumble bash open scary box.
[2305.77s -> 2313.06s]  Another bumble. What a twist. Bumble the nimble has been unlocked. Just came.
[2314.02s -> 2341.32s]  Forlorn Hollow has unlocked. That's been bumble, guys. So we unlock the next area after that.
[2341.88s -> 2362.76s]  Okay. Let's do it again. New game. Let's see. What's the new bumble do? His puzzle attacks
[2362.76s -> 2384.57s]  gain mana. Remove a single tile. Damage goes up with each hit. What that bumble do?
[2393.75s -> 2399.80s]  Each cast of the spell in a single room. All right. So they have their own poo shields.
[2403.83s -> 2415.35s]  I'm going right up the middle. Set up the fucking bones. I'm just going to, whatever.
[2415.35s -> 2425.74s]  I could do this. I could gum up the middle and then could set up a five bone scenario,
[2425.74s -> 2444.68s]  a six bone scenario. Yeah, that's what we're doing. Fucked it up. This is what we'd like to call
[2444.68s -> 2477.94s]  fucking wasting time. Oh, let's go. What? But they have different moves. Oh, it's five. Five
[2477.94s -> 2485.96s]  damage. I thought it was like the big tooth that comes down. All right. So it's, if it's, it has
[2485.96s -> 2493.40s]  to be seven, not more than like five. Okay. Seven is the big one. I get it. Oh, you know when you
[2493.40s -> 2502.57s]  just like, when a run gets fucked up, you know what I mean? Uh, well, I, I think I die. We'll
[2502.57s -> 2515.56s]  find out. See if I can live. He soft locked it. I could do a bunch of pee. How many would that
[2515.56s -> 2524.63s]  give me? One, two, three, four, five. I can't do the six. Can I? I have to get all of this pee.
[2528.30s -> 2543.62s]  That'll give me, I only have two moves. I'm going to get hit. I'm dead. I can drink six in two.
[2544.42s -> 2551.34s]  Can I? This has to go forward and down. That's five. Forward, down. That's, I guess I could do
[2551.34s -> 2560.34s]  this. Yeah. Okay. What does it do? Not, not that good. Just what? Two more moves.
[2563.51s -> 2568.31s]  Right. Oh, actually that did help a lot. Wait a minute. I get three, one, one, two, three.
[2580.31s -> 2606.20s]  See you later. No. Wait. I'm dead. All right. No more joking around. It's time for the real one.
[2609.35s -> 2615.72s]  Uh, let's do, I had more. What? I could have done it again. Yeah. Only one more time. It's
[2615.72s -> 2630.18s]  only one damage. What? Really? All right. Let's get serious. What do I even want to do here?
[2630.18s -> 2650.23s]  A lot of flying enemies. It goes up one damage every time. So what can I start to set up here?
[2651.03s -> 2661.02s]  I can set up bones. If I bring this over here, that goes one, two, three. Oh, check this. Yeah.
[2661.02s -> 2670.10s]  Let's do it. Let's do a seven bone setup. I'm going to, I'm going to take damage here though.
[2670.10s -> 2676.47s]  It's worth it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I'm going to take,
[2679.05s -> 2682.89s]  it's not worth it, but I'm going to do it. It's not worth it. Like I don't even know why I keep
[2682.89s -> 2702.04s]  doing it. I'm dead again. It's not worth it. The ultimate greed. Yeah. I'm dead.
[2703.32s -> 2713.11s]  Cause no, I can't survive this. Could have had the seven. Oh, whatever. Yeah. Restart, restart,
[2713.11s -> 2719.34s]  restart, restart. New game. I'm not just going to set up seven and eight scenarios this whole time.
[2729.05s -> 2734.74s]  Quitter. No, it's not about getting like rows of seven. It's about trying to
[2734.74s -> 2745.21s]  control these little mutants. All right. Rocks. I don't know what they do. That's a bomb. I don't
[2745.21s -> 2766.82s]  know what that does. Let's start with this. Oh, let's just go poop to do P. Get set up a five P.
[2767.78s -> 2782.95s]  Yeah. I'll do a five P set up here. That's six P set up. Sorry. No, it's not. Stop,
[2782.95s -> 2787.51s]  stop doing six and seven P setups. No, it's not worth it. Just do the five.
[2788.47s -> 2793.03s]  Oh, I can get seven. No, stop going for seven. I don't have to go for seven every time. What's
[2793.03s -> 2800.95s]  wrong with me? I'm just doing five. Okay. Here we go. You gotta, you gotta go for it. I can't just
[2800.95s -> 2832.02s]  like set up five and six. All right. But I can do this. How many teats have I got? See? Yeah. I
[2832.02s -> 2841.69s]  don't have so I could get a row of 10. You're dead by the time you get there. Enemies move slower.
[2841.69s -> 2855.48s]  Stopwatch. Buzz down. Move a tile column one down. That one seems cool. So that's four bones.
[2856.28s -> 2864.46s]  All right. We got two. The bomb in the back. Poopsie here. Set up a, I could set up a fucking
[2864.46s -> 2885.45s]  six teeth scenario. Oh, what's that? We get a six teeth scenario. Wait. Uh, this is going to do
[2885.45s -> 2901.35s]  five damage, right? I gotta remember how that works. This is five damage. Okay. Five. Yeah,
[2901.35s -> 2921.10s]  right. Don't do that ever again. Uh, take a hit. Oh, sorry. The bomb is getting close though.
[2927.98s -> 2937.78s]  Use the toothpick. I can't. I need, I need a bunch of pee for that. Remove a single tile. I could do
[2937.78s -> 2953.61s]  this. Gives me a little more time. And then I could toothpick the, I've got three moves.
[2955.10s -> 2968.76s]  This might be a set up a bone scenario. If I go down, no, it's not worth it. Just get,
[2968.76s -> 2993.14s]  I have to kill something. I'm not doing seven bones. Use the needle. It's only going to do one
[2993.14s -> 3008.23s]  damage. I'm going to save it. Three moves. I go down and then left and then I have to hit something.
[3011.66s -> 3019.10s]  Do seven bones or riot. No, I'm not doing seven fucking bones. I can't. It's going to take me too
[3019.10s -> 3027.43s]  much time. I could do like this, which is, that's not even correct. I don't even know. I don't even
[3027.43s -> 3037.74s]  see what you're saying. Need poo to protect against the bomb fly. Wait, is he going to explode?
[3042.97s -> 3056.30s]  Pop the stuff under the bones. You mean like here? I mean, pop under the bone. You mean like pop.
[3057.10s -> 3059.90s]  All right. But how many, I have one. I only have, I can only do this once.
[3060.78s -> 3074.97s]  I'm talking about pop like here. Drag this down. I can't believe I'm doing like a seven setup.
[3074.97s -> 3087.51s]  You guys are going to get me killed. I need to get a tooth here first. Don't I?
[3093.00s -> 3120.28s]  No, seven bones. Oh my God. I can get seven bones this turn. You want to pop this one, this pop.
[3122.20s -> 3124.68s]  Yes, no, yes, no. All right. I'm just going to, I'm popping it.
[3125.72s -> 3138.46s]  I have three moves. So then I go over here, which is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[3139.80s -> 3159.88s]  Bring this one down. Yeah, this is it. Seven bones. Only seven bones.
[3160.28s -> 3175.93s]  Oh, what did I take damage for? How was the bomb fly? Okay. This is an easier one, I think.
[3183.05s -> 3194.73s]  Just kill it. And I have, oh, enemies move slower. Should I just do that? What does it do?
[3194.73s -> 3198.98s]  I've never, what does it do? Next wave of baddies move less. All right, cool.
[3199.94s -> 3204.82s]  Seven teeth, seven teeth, seven teeth, seven teeth, seven teeth, seven teeth.
[3212.04s -> 3218.52s]  I don't care about optimal reverse, like calculate every seven move. I just want to, I'm playing it.
[3226.94s -> 3233.18s]  Every move must have at least five to seven tiles removed each turn or inefficient, ineffective.
[3233.98s -> 3244.36s]  So I'm going to do, I have one move. Can I do anything with this one move? I set up seven teeth.
[3249.50s -> 3310.68s]  Or I set up fucking five teeth. Who cares? I'm thinking. I'm thinking. Speak. I'm thinking.
[3310.68s -> 3316.71s]  I'm trying to think. I'm thinking, I'm thinking if I drop, I don't know, I can move just over.
[3318.65s -> 3323.37s]  Just hold on. I got it. I've got it figured out. I'm going to drag this over and I'm going to drop
[3323.37s -> 3327.45s]  and I'm going to get a fucking five poops. Check it out. And you're going to be very proud of me.
[3340.79s -> 3358.06s]  Told you you're going to be proud of me. All right. Now we're going to go with this because I feel like
[3366.47s -> 3378.10s]  that was a huge mistake, but it's okay. Wait, maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe not. I think I
[3378.10s -> 3383.40s]  can do it still. Yeah. Hold on. No, that's not a bone up there. What about a tooth? I need a
[3383.40s -> 3390.90s]  tooth drop right here. Okay. Wait, everybody watch this shit. This is what we call problem solving.
[3401.03s -> 3409.18s]  Butterbean, knock back all enemies plus one coin. Knock back all enemies.
[3409.18s -> 3421.03s]  Nice. Bumble versus the Duke. Keep him small. Spell ready. Did I only use this once? I can use
[3421.03s -> 3427.94s]  this one time. All right. Give me chat. Give me a seven bone scenario. Let's do it. Let's set it up.
[3434.18s -> 3447.61s]  There's one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, five. Move the one top to the right down.
[3448.58s -> 3472.50s]  No, fuck. I'm just. Stay still and make him move slower and give me some more moves.
[3477.32s -> 3496.18s]  Not yet. Seven P. Yep. This is not going to activate it, right? Seven P. So this is going to be one,
[3496.18s -> 3510.47s]  two. Is this even going to work? If I move. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[3516.66s -> 3529.98s]  You can't. Omega lull. Hold on. Just wait. Up and then up. And I have fucking so many
[3529.98s -> 3549.67s]  peas next round. Up. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Next round. All right. One, two, three.
[3561.38s -> 3591.66s]  Everybody back the fuck up. Wait. I screamed so loud. Hey, thank you, dad. Thanks for the 10
[3591.66s -> 3597.96s]  community subs. Dad. Appreciate that, dad. Thanks for the 10 subs, dude. Seriously. All right. So
[3597.96s -> 3605.86s]  let's, let's do a little, let's put it to a poop right there. And then we're going to drop down a,
[3608.42s -> 3624.63s]  I think that two more moves. Kill that. Maybe. To that. Yeah. Whatever. Then got another move I can
[3624.63s -> 3638.79s]  do. Go. Needle. Bang. Needle again. Bang. And then what's that? Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't been
[3638.79s -> 3648.46s]  slowed down. Fucking idiot. And then, yeah, just, just for fun. Just because, just because you're
[3648.46s -> 3669.67s]  ugly. You know what I mean? Okay. That's two rounds of stun to add to our pool collection.
[3670.39s -> 3697.27s]  Is that a bone scenario over here? Nice shot. Idiot. Seven bone scenario. Is there? I mean,
[3697.27s -> 3701.99s]  I could drop this tile here, move over, move down. Wait, hold on. Are you guys for real?
[3701.99s -> 3709.11s]  This is a seven bone scenario coming up? What if I go here? No. Here. Drop the tile there.
[3717.93s -> 3725.80s]  Let me think about this. I can remove two tiles. So let's go bang right here. I get it. I get a
[3725.80s -> 3734.49s]  bone here. You can remove. I can remove. Wait, hold on. Two, two, four, six. Holy shit. I can
[3734.49s -> 3741.54s]  do three tile moves. Okay. All right. So I'm going to remove. We need to have a communication
[3741.54s -> 3747.86s]  way if you guys talk to me in chat. Remember, think it's a board, right? So we're going to say
[3747.86s -> 3755.80s]  four. Like this is one, two, three, four. Okay. This is one, two, three, four. If you want me
[3755.80s -> 3764.28s]  to see something, you have to say one or like two, two, three, two dash three. One, two, three,
[3764.28s -> 3770.76s]  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. They're nine. Two, six, two, eight, two, three. See?
[3773.24s -> 3776.52s]  I'm not going to, if it's more than two numbers, I'm not going to read your chat message.
[3777.16s -> 3785.74s]  Okay. So what do you, what do you guys see here? You've seen a scenario?
[3790.54s -> 3793.50s]  Now everyone's all fucked up. I'm going to do, I'm doing two, two,
[3794.47s -> 3802.81s]  two, two, three, two, two, two, three, two, three. That's my play. Two, two, two, three, two, three.
[3807.21s -> 3820.55s]  Right? That's what I'm saying. Two, two, two, three, one, two, three, four. That's only six.
[3821.19s -> 3851.48s]  Hold on. Wait. Oh, fuck. Wait a minute. I fucked it up. And then I can do two, two,
[3852.12s -> 3863.00s]  down. And then next round, do it. Okay. Two, two, two, two, down. And then back the fuck up.
[3870.46s -> 3894.70s]  You got to give me info. Two, one, two, two, four, four, full heal. Teeth deal plus one damage.
[3894.70s -> 3905.98s]  That's okay. These are both insane. Does this mean I can use it whenever I want?
[3906.62s -> 3915.82s]  Or does that mean it happens right now and that's it? Just once. Okay. I'm going to go with the
[3915.82s -> 3928.55s]  teeth damage. I like that better. The stat wheel. 15 cents for, hold on, this is a casino. Oh, fuck.
[3930.18s -> 3945.10s]  Randomized needle. What else is here? Five cents for heart or item or the shell game.
[3945.98s -> 3958.30s]  That's a lot. Randomize, reroll the spell. Spell charge less. Man, I need a spell cost less.
[3959.42s -> 3963.82s]  Spin the wheel. You never play the wheel at the casino. It's the worst thing to do.
[3964.54s -> 3986.07s]  What does that do? Oh, cool. Great. I got extra luck. All right. I'm going for it. Whoa. There's no way
[3986.07s -> 3997.85s]  anyone could figure that out. Nobody saw the end of that. Nobody did. Spells change each room.
[3998.57s -> 4016.30s]  I wish I had a heal though. Oh my God. You can just buy one. I have no more money.
[4020.22s -> 4034.86s]  So what's the trinket that I just got? Randomize spells? Oh, this is all different now. What's it?
[4035.82s -> 4046.55s]  Oh, this is actually, I don't like that. Destroy a column of tiles and then blind an enemy.
[4047.35s -> 4053.69s]  All right. Well, whatever. I guess maybe you could give us an error. Does this last the whole time
[4053.69s -> 4060.89s]  I'm down here? I'm going to do that more often. I'm sorry. All right. Oh, I don't like this board.
[4064.95s -> 4068.07s]  I need to do bones though, because I have the bone trinket. So we're doing bones.
[4069.03s -> 4084.92s]  I'm thinking, let's see. Bang. Yeah. Oh, oh, oh. And then I, oh, what's that? I call that a
[4085.88s -> 4114.84s]  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven bone scenario. So that's, let me see. Oh, I don't,
[4114.84s -> 4119.40s]  no, fuck. I don't have my thing. I think to break tiles. Oh, let me see. One, two, three.
[4120.36s -> 4140.18s]  One, two, three. I can do it next turn. I'm going to win. Am I going to die? No. Oh, all right. I
[4140.18s -> 4162.68s]  win. It was not, I don't think that was worth losing a full heart for though. This is pepper
[4162.68s -> 4171.13s]  and number one movement gaining attack. Ooh, that takes a lot of resources, but it's really cool.
[4174.02s -> 4181.88s]  Booger and knockback. I already have a knockback. I'm not buying the ghost pepper. This one is a
[4181.96s -> 4189.86s]  damn, you do damage and you get a move. I can stay alive. All right. No more fucking around.
[4190.58s -> 4197.50s]  What is this? Oh, it's, oh, it's, it doesn't matter. Everything's random every time.
[4198.62s -> 4209.69s]  Skip to the next chapter. Should, should do it. There is no next chapter. I haven't unlocked it
[4209.69s -> 4221.67s]  yet. Okay. Well, we're fine. Hmm. All right. I don't know what these guys do for, well,
[4221.67s -> 4224.79s]  I'm going to have to put some food down, I think. And yeah, let's gum it up a little.
[4232.95s -> 4254.58s]  Uh, let's throw a tooth to damage. Nice, uh, stink club. Okay. P I could just, I could move
[4254.58s -> 4265.32s]  and just get some, no shit. All right. I could do P and just kind of recalibrate. No, I can't.
[4268.98s -> 4284.58s]  I need the P though for this. All right. Hold on. Wait. No, I have to, I just gotta, I gotta get
[4284.58s -> 4300.65s]  this fucking going and kill. What is this thing doing? Blinding attack. Gain plus one damage for
[4300.65s -> 4321.74s]  the room. Why should I blind? I think this is like just a shield, isn't it? All right. I'm
[4321.74s -> 4336.06s]  hitting harder in the room. Gain mana equals to most common tile. Who? So if I gain, so I'm
[4336.06s -> 4342.73s]  going to gain six Pooh mana, but I don't, I don't even use Pooh mana, but just again.
[4344.97s -> 4356.74s]  Okay. I'll just do it again. Where the fuck did this come from? All right. I got to, um,
[4358.10s -> 4367.40s]  right down the middle, I got to get rid of this. I got to kill this thing.
[4368.44s -> 4373.96s]  Seven Pooh. No, I'm going to die. I get it. I've got to do bones. I've got to do bones.
[4374.92s -> 4384.42s]  Can I do bones twice? You know, I could kill the thing that's about to attack.
[4397.77s -> 4401.21s]  Yeah, this is actually really bad. Uh, I'm going to have to kill the thing. I have to.
[4402.65s -> 4410.38s]  Otherwise I'm fucked. Spell is ready. Blinding attack. We're going to do that on
[4411.98s -> 4426.74s]  left. Gotcha. Now you're in trouble. No one's attacking yet. I'm good. Oh, this is bad. Um,
[4427.62s -> 4458.14s]  I have to set up some Pooh defense. This is a bad board. This is not a good board. Gaining mana
[4458.14s -> 4462.46s]  for the most common tile. It's Pooh, but I, right? How many is it? Boogers or Pooh? It's Pooh. I
[4462.46s -> 4490.60s]  have to get rid of Pooh. Three, one. What about it? Two, five, two, four, two, one, two, three,
[4490.60s -> 4501.93s]  four, five, two, five, two, four. I know I saw that too, but I think that screws up. I'll go for it.
[4501.93s -> 4526.55s]  All right. But, uh, I can't defend myself against these guys. Is it teeth now? It's Pooh. Fuck.
[4527.27s -> 4541.70s]  How much damage is this going to do? It can kill you. And then I'm going to have to take a hit.
[4549.02s -> 4563.37s]  Dammit. You guys just keep coming out of nowhere. This is kind of shit.
[4569.11s -> 4578.90s]  Too much Boogers and too much Pooh. Reroll? I would love to. I can't. I think I'm dead here.
[4579.54s -> 4600.42s]  That gave me a bunch of Boogers, which I don't even need. Eyes? I think dead. I could put down a...
[4600.42s -> 4620.84s]  No one's attacking yet, so that's good. Where am I going to put it though? Over here.
[4621.96s -> 4630.90s]  I'll put it right down the middle. Yeah. All right. Come on. Give me your worst. And then I can do...
[4632.02s -> 4648.22s]  I can do an Ultra P. And then I can do a Super Booger. But where do I want that? On the right,
[4648.22s -> 4660.66s]  I guess? I guess that prevents me from dying right now. I need more teeth. All right,
[4660.66s -> 4663.86s]  Ariel. Let's just go like this. And I'm throwing this right down the middle.
[4664.58s -> 4680.55s]  Okay. Gain extra damage for the room. Yeah. I keep spawning these things. Shit.
[4683.59s -> 4692.65s]  It keeps... I gotta kill these things. I gotta get all the way to the back. Okay. New... Okay.
[4693.29s -> 4727.35s]  It's going to have to be Pooh Shield on the left. I need a seven bone scenario. I gotta just try to
[4727.35s -> 4735.54s]  kill one of these fucking guys. Can I get the bone? Can I set up a blinding attack? Wait, that's...
[4735.94s -> 4757.59s]  I got extra damage for the whole floor. What was it? Teeth? Okay. I gotta set up a... Let's
[4757.59s -> 4772.97s]  gonna go, I don't know, down here. Go over here. And then maybe I could go from... Shit.
[4773.93s -> 4786.28s]  That's all I can really do. Can I stop anything? I think that's all I got. Do a seven Pooh scenario.
[4788.17s -> 4793.61s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. That's way too much. That can take a million years.
[4794.89s -> 4804.31s]  The two spread out. I could go down here and then... What do you want? What are you talking about?
[4805.03s -> 4812.31s]  Set up the heart. That's a much better idea. I've set up the heart.
[4813.11s -> 4826.71s]  Whatever else you guys want me to do. Disgusting. Now I can heal.
[4833.18s -> 4841.35s]  It's not three hearts. It's not three. It's four. Oh, no. It's four hearts like everything else.
[4841.35s -> 4848.76s]  Oh, no. That was a mistake. Shit. It's... I don't know why. I just thought it was three hearts
[4848.76s -> 4861.86s]  because they don't... It's all right. I'm fine. Jesus Christ. They're just filling the board now.
[4862.50s -> 4878.46s]  I'm about to take the... Wait. If I go like this, then I can do a shield on the right.
[4879.42s -> 4888.02s]  Hold on. Let me see what I can do. That's all you get? What kind of fucking messed up world is
[4888.02s -> 4898.31s]  that? It's only half a heart. I gotta kill one of these things and I have Pooh set up for next round.
[4909.75s -> 4917.16s]  No. I think I may have fucked it. I think I spent... I did this too many times.
[4917.80s -> 4927.45s]  It's not completely over. I can do two shields. I can go over here. No, no, no, no. I can go...
[4928.57s -> 4940.20s]  I can do one shield. One and then... If I like your Lich Escape, 5,000 bits. Thanks for the 5,000
[4940.20s -> 4949.88s]  bits on top of your like three of $5,000 you get into this channel. You don't get to make fun of
[4949.88s -> 4964.70s]  chat ever again because you're literally playing pee-pee poo-poo. Yes, I know. Four, seven, one,
[4964.70s -> 4977.16s]  four. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Left. What does that do? Thank you so much for
[4977.16s -> 4986.71s]  like three of those. Seriously. Two, two. Two, two. One, two. One, two. Two, two. Yeah, I know.
[4987.43s -> 4999.02s]  But I don't know if that helps me. I can... I know... At least I know I can do this. I can do that.
[4999.58s -> 5011.75s]  For that. Does that help me later? I mean, it stops whatever's going on here. I need to set the
[5011.75s -> 5020.25s]  bones up. Bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone.
[5021.13s -> 5024.57s]  Instead of the bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone,
[5024.57s -> 5048.18s]  bones. You know like that? Six bones only. No, I gotta free... Seven bones of bust. I'm just
[5048.18s -> 5054.41s]  gonna do this. I don't know if everyone's gonna be like, wait, what'd you do?
[5061.21s -> 5076.06s]  All right, these guys are the worst. Okay, now I could P. I could get P. And wait, is there a
[5076.06s -> 5082.86s]  better P scenario there? Maybe. If I go over and then down, that'll give me more turns to then...
[5083.82s -> 5106.95s]  Fucking no. And then... Maybe I could do bones. Seven bones scenario. You know what? It's actually
[5106.95s -> 5113.54s]  kind of funny you saying that, but I think I was... I needed to kill these things fast. I just didn't
[5113.54s -> 5117.30s]  know what they did. I was too focused on like the toilet paper guys when I should have killed
[5117.30s -> 5126.30s]  these guys immediately. I need the mana for the bones. Yeah, I know. I'm just gonna go like this
[5134.79s -> 5141.53s]  and then I'm gonna kill one on the right and then I'm gonna end my turn again.
[5142.49s -> 5162.33s]  I can't do anything. Thankfully, no one's attacking right now. So, all right. Any bones?
[5178.31s -> 5186.50s]  Well, if I blinding attack, will it kill it through here? Or is it gonna...
[5187.06s -> 5194.89s]  Are we certain about that or is it gonna block it? What the fuck just happened?
[5197.21s -> 5212.90s]  What the... It attacked me? Why? Oh, now I really am dead. Uh-oh. Can I keep... I can at least keep
[5212.90s -> 5226.84s]  this going for another... Who's... I'm gonna freeze you and then... No one's attacking, right? Oh,
[5226.84s -> 5236.22s]  you asshole. Right in the middle. Bones. I need bones. This is taking so much longer than it should.
[5237.10s -> 5250.73s]  I could go like this and then I need to block this guy. I die if I don't block that guy.
[5259.48s -> 5284.39s]  It's over. You know what the real culprit was? This guy right here. I'm dead. Holy shit. I'm alive.
[5287.77s -> 5303.34s]  Uh, I could kill them both but then that... I'm just like treading water perpetually.
[5304.30s -> 5318.79s]  BZ seven bones? No, it's not. It's gonna take like two turns. But I could do five bone in two turns
[5318.79s -> 5325.11s]  but that... Does that help me? I'm talking about like you go one bang and there's five there
[5327.35s -> 5339.11s]  or I could go... You're dead in one hit. I know. That's why I can't... I have to kill these two on
[5339.11s -> 5344.60s]  the sides. If I don't kill these two on the sides, I have to make them... I'm just dead. So, that's
[5344.60s -> 5373.26s]  what has to happen. So now, set up the five bone scenario. Or, wait. One, two, three... I got a
[5373.26s -> 5394.26s]  six bone scenario. Six bone scenario coming up. If you can do it... If you can do it, you can
[5394.26s -> 5402.94s]  survive these two and set up for the next. I... I'm about to die right now. If I... No, if I do
[5402.94s -> 5412.14s]  seven bones, this thing's gonna activate and it's gonna kill me. It's gonna kill me. Booger mid.
[5416.52s -> 5430.94s]  No, let me... I'm gonna do six bone scenario. Okay. Bang. Bang. All right. And then we're gonna...
[5430.94s -> 5442.14s]  I'm clearing it. And then we're gonna kill this guy on the left. And then. And only then. What do
[5442.14s -> 5474.15s]  you mean why? If this thing takes damage, I die. What happened? I can't attack these guys.
[5475.42s -> 5501.32s]  I can't attack them. Give me some... Wait. I can do six. I could do seven, actually. No, I couldn't.
[5501.32s -> 5508.28s]  Yes, I can. What does seven poo do? Have we even seen it yet? No, we don't know what it does. I'm
[5508.28s -> 5545.00s]  doing it. What does it do? Okay. That's pretty great, actually. That's really good. Uh, okay. I
[5545.00s -> 5558.44s]  think I'm okay for a while. But god damn it, these clouds! All right. Ugh. I need bones. I'm
[5558.44s -> 5570.73s]  just building bones. That's all I care about. If I go this way, this way, and then down, I'm just...
[5570.73s -> 5590.23s]  I don't... I'm just doing bones only. What did that just do? Bones only. Blinding attack. I have some.
[5590.23s -> 5612.02s]  I'm not using it yet, though. Game... Why would I press this? Stop telling me to do that. And then
[5612.02s -> 5623.06s]  gum up the booger. I know. I'm gonna do it. Let's see. What do I got? I could do this booger here,
[5623.70s -> 5629.74s]  and then... Who should I gum up? On the left? That's what I'm probably gonna do.
[5634.95s -> 5652.89s]  And then I need these blinding attacks. It's so bad. All right. Can I throw a tooth?
[5653.69s -> 5662.12s]  I have seven bone mana. Yeah, I need eight. I don't want to use it, though, because
[5663.56s -> 5666.92s]  they're just gonna keep spawning them. Yeah, I have to clear these and then kill that before
[5666.92s -> 5678.50s]  that little cloud there. I have shield. I have time. Yeah, I'm all right. I just want to...
[5679.54s -> 5697.91s]  I guess I could bring this down and bring the bone over. I could do this. I could do this. And then
[5698.63s -> 5709.62s]  get the teeth. Half-Life VR game announced on Valve's Twitter.
[5712.90s -> 5731.75s]  What? Are you serious? Half-Life VR. Half-Life VR. Oh, that's fucking cool.
[5733.70s -> 5737.06s]  We'll see, though. I'm gonna hold off judgment, because here's the thing about VR games.
[5738.55s -> 5744.71s]  This... Okay, if this is like a two hour and 25 minute Valve tech demo, then I don't care.
[5745.59s -> 5757.27s]  We'll find out. If this is the real deal, I'm in. If this is like a 48 minute long demo for their new
[5757.27s -> 5770.01s]  controllers, then I'm not in. Speaking of being in, why is he still on this level? Because it's kind
[5770.01s -> 5775.29s]  of hard. And these guys are... They spawn. You can't hurt these guys. It's pretty... It's cool.
[5775.29s -> 5778.73s]  It's a fun game. He's trying to challenge, trying to get through the fucking hard levels.
[5779.29s -> 5786.62s]  All right. I'm setting up Bones only. And I know people are going to be like, what are you doing?
[5787.74s -> 5802.57s]  Oh my... I can't believe he just did that. Dude, I can't even watch this stream because of him.
[5803.53s -> 5818.90s]  Bones. And we're going to the bright side. Okay. Drop that stupid gas thing. What's the better
[5818.90s -> 5836.82s]  play? This or this? Probably that. This guy set up a five poo scenario, maybe? The poo protects from...
[5836.82s -> 5842.50s]  Wait, what are you saying? The poo protects the clouds. If this is not real, I'm going to be very
[5842.50s -> 5850.57s]  mad at you. You guys are so fucked. Thank you. Appreciate it. We can... Now this game... This
[5850.57s -> 5859.96s]  level's got five times easier. So now I can do this two more times. I'm going to... I could go
[5859.96s -> 5866.15s]  bang bang. That wouldn't... It's not finally we can end this. We're not even close. We're not even
[5866.15s -> 5873.86s]  remotely close yet. If only it didn't take you 25 minutes to read that. I've only been on this
[5873.86s -> 5879.38s]  level for like 18 minutes. So like... Pump the brakes a little. Screech on the brakes.
[5880.34s -> 5883.86s]  I haven't even been 25 minutes. It's only been like 17 or 18.
[5884.58s -> 5892.09s]  All right. Let's go. Go for the health. That's a good idea. But I don't... I don't have any more health.
[5895.06s -> 5903.77s]  No, I'm set. Look. You know what? No. Okay. Go for a heart match. I need four hearts. There's no hearts
[5903.77s -> 5943.93s]  coming down on the menu. I'm setting up the shit. I'm setting up poop. Oops. Don't fucking... I'm
[5943.93s -> 5954.41s]  going to mess this up now. Give me the teeth. I was going to do like seven poos. Almost had nine of every...
[5955.53s -> 5969.46s]  Yeah. Almost nine of every minute. You're right. Three, nine, two, three, five. One, two, three, nine,
[5969.46s -> 5973.46s]  two, three, five. Three, nine, three. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine,
[5973.46s -> 6021.50s]  two, three, five, nine, eight, seven, six, five. Excellent. New spells. Like all... This thing
[6021.50s -> 6027.10s]  fucking punched me in the face and then threw me in front of a train. I don't have any spells. I have
[6027.10s -> 6035.99s]  this one. I only have this one. All right. Let's do teeth, three, smack, and he wins.
[6053.34s -> 6061.83s]  But I do need... I'm going to... Let's go to the bones. Come on. So down, down. So up, up, down,
[6061.83s -> 6075.05s]  down, down, down. It doesn't matter. Uh, I think... Wait, wait, wait. Can I... Where's the poop?
[6075.61s -> 6085.61s]  I can put it down. Let's poo the right. Gum up the poop. Let's go gum up on this guy and then poop
[6085.61s -> 6102.10s]  on this guy and then see you next time. See you later. Wait, hold on a second. No, who cares?
[6102.90s -> 6115.50s]  Who even cares? I'm just going to win. Cool. Tough love. Tough love.
[6123.43s -> 6130.55s]  No, I... Finally. Let me tell you something about the word finally. I... This is all new shit every
[6130.55s -> 6137.98s]  single level. It's like I can't just... I don't know. I have to relearn my whole build when I
[6137.98s -> 6147.50s]  walk through the door. 25 minutes. Finally. 25 minutes. Finally. Oh, that's fucking incredible.
[6147.50s -> 6151.26s]  Too bad. I'm going to use this many times. Okay. Reduce the cost of your spells. Okay.
[6155.90s -> 6163.03s]  That's cool. All right. Add three wild tile. Spells cost less for the room. Heals half a heart.
[6163.03s -> 6177.83s]  So we need bones and... I mean, that's pretty awesome. Poo and goo. Let me see. How do I set
[6177.83s -> 6185.96s]  up a good poo and goo scenario? What does this do? What's the icon on the head for?
[6186.84s -> 6206.07s]  You don't like the music? Oh, there's no options. Here, I'll turn it down. All right. I can go... I'm
[6206.07s -> 6215.67s]  going to do a tooth. Should I just try to kill this thing right now? I wonder how... Let me see.
[6216.39s -> 6222.01s]  I'm just going to hit this thing. I don't know if it does. I guess it's just dead, I guess.
[6223.06s -> 6232.52s]  Oh, fuck. It's one of those things. Poo right down the middle. I need poo and I need goo. Although,
[6233.82s -> 6243.45s]  I could do five. All right. Hold on. Hear me out on this. I could do five. Damn it. No.
[6244.25s -> 6248.58s]  Just mute and play better music. You guys really don't like it that much, huh?
[6262.38s -> 6276.87s]  Now, if I go like this and then I go like this, I don't do that. One, two, three, four, five, six.
[6277.83s -> 6288.15s]  If I go down with this, I get another move, though. Oh, no. I knew that was going to happen.
[6288.15s -> 6293.83s]  Why did I do that? I knew that was going to fucking happen. Did you see how I stopped?
[6293.83s -> 6298.74s]  And I was like, no, wait. Why did I do that? I knew that was going to happen. I got a double
[6298.74s -> 6312.10s]  thing. Oh, fuck. Shit. I knew that was going to happen. Six poo ruined. Yeah, I fucked it up.
[6314.28s -> 6343.90s]  Well, I got... This is where it gets fucking hairy. Like, really hairy. I don't think I can do
[6343.90s -> 6355.03s]  seven bones. I think I'm dead before I do it. I could set up a... I could set it up, but
[6355.03s -> 6370.10s]  seven bones next turn. What are you saying? Like, down here, down here. Because that'll be six and
[6370.10s -> 6373.14s]  then I could drag. All right. I'm going to do it. I'm going to... I might die. Let's see if I die.
[6377.16s -> 6402.04s]  Uh, so far, it's a first, right? All right. This is... I win. No, I didn't. Wait. Uh, what do I have?
[6402.04s -> 6421.64s]  Nine? So I just had to... No, do I gum them up? I gotta be careful about this guy. And then, wait.
[6426.30s -> 6436.33s]  Oh, my. Oh, my. Wait, wait. I don't know what I'm doing. What am I doing? Holy shit. Okay. Um,
[6436.97s -> 6457.06s]  over here, and then you, then here, then throw, then... Oh, man. We got more wild tiles. Can I keep
[6457.06s -> 6471.91s]  this? There's too many flashing, like, Super Mario stars. Um, I want that heart. I want a super heart.
[6471.91s -> 6478.74s]  No, I don't. I just want one heart. I could do a big turn. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I could
[6478.74s -> 6491.08s]  do... I don't know. This is a lot to do here. I could do a big, huge super go more. Oh, it doesn't
[6491.08s -> 6504.14s]  matter. Why did it not activate immediately? There it is. All right. Full health. Now, I just need to do...
[6508.41s -> 6530.65s]  Uh, I just win. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, I did. Mega battery plus three movement plus random man.
[6530.65s -> 6540.06s]  This doesn't matter anyways. It's gonna be fucking rainbowed anyways. Plus three movement
[6540.06s -> 6553.38s]  random man. I mean, what? Doesn't matter. Bumble versus dusk. All right, time. Let's go. Time to
[6553.38s -> 6560.92s]  reload everything I've known about my whole build. Movement gaining attack. Destroy all tiles of one
[6560.92s -> 6567.64s]  type. Blocks the next single attack. Charges random usable item. Hits the furthest enemy plus splash.
[6568.60s -> 6576.82s]  Okay. Plus three movement and random mana. Should I do it right off the bat? Go for it right off the
[6576.82s -> 6584.06s]  bat. Let's go. How much mana? All right. I got, I got a seven bone scenario I can do now. I got
[6584.06s -> 6593.18s]  one, two, three, four, five moves. One, one, two, three, four, five. There's seven bones on the board.
[6593.18s -> 6601.02s]  How do we get the seven bones to make a seven bone scenario? I don't want to mess this up.
[6601.66s -> 6612.86s]  No, it's possible. It is. It'll be possible next turn. If I go over, over down, that's three,
[6612.86s -> 6628.97s]  which then has this row. No, three. Okay. Hold on. I hope I'm doing this right. Okay. Then this one
[6628.97s -> 6641.37s]  comes up and then no, no, no, no, no, three. This, no, this goes down, right? Okay. This comes down.
[6642.33s -> 6650.79s]  Then this goes over. What? No, no, that was right. Because I have to move this one over.
[6651.35s -> 6659.54s]  That's too many moves. Use one, just all to the top row. What do you mean all the top row?
[6660.18s -> 6672.14s]  What do you do? What do you mean? Do it on the top row? Should I? So like this and then
[6673.10s -> 6687.16s]  it's all right. Let's go. Uh oh. Okay. He doesn't, he just hits you. Seven bones. I almost just
[6687.16s -> 6701.29s]  double clicked. Okay. Seven bone scenario. Light them up. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[6701.29s -> 6707.38s]  God, I couldn't do it in one move. Damn it. Okay. Hold on. Hits the furthest enemy with splash
[6707.38s -> 6711.48s]  damage. Did it in one move.
[6739.40s -> 6748.68s]  Someone stinky mom. The dog with human face. A hot dog with teeth. It's a mystery.
[6749.96s -> 6757.56s]  What's in there Bumble? Bumble back open scary box. What's this? Another Bumble?
[6758.52s -> 6772.47s]  This is the fat Bumble. You unlock Bumble the stout. And halls of Belial have unlocked.
[6778.63s -> 6789.54s]  What's your thing? Whoa, this game sucks ass. What? What are you talking about? This game's like
[6789.54s -> 6809.30s]  coal. I like this. This is fun. This is an iPad game. It's not an iPad game. Bannum. All right.
[6809.30s -> 6817.05s]  So this is Bumble the stout stick. Whack away. That's three poops. That's a blender blade
[6817.05s -> 6826.97s]  destroys tiles and touching tiles. Kind of a shitty stats setup though. Terrible
[6826.97s -> 6832.66s]  in everything. So far Bumble, Bumble's the best. Bumble the brave.
[6843.08s -> 6852.71s]  Let's try the new one. Yeah, you got to play with them to unlock the next floor anyways. Yeah.
[6859.43s -> 6872.92s]  Okay, so I have whack away. So might as well just load up poops, huh? I mean, I could just do this now.
[6873.72s -> 6877.85s]  Or I could load up a big one. Yeah, fuck it. Let's just do this.
[6880.30s -> 6912.78s]  Mana drain. Yeah, fuck it. Watch this. Whack away. It's two damage. Best character in the game.
[6917.62s -> 6928.04s]  Let's throw a bone. Actually, I'm gonna get hit. No, I'm not. Yes, I am. Should have killed this guy.
[6928.04s -> 6932.79s]  I'm fucking dumb. It's all right. I'm a little dumb, but whatever.
[6946.41s -> 6949.77s]  Stories tiles and see this is I need to use this to see how that works.
[6950.73s -> 6981.14s]  Okay, uh, there's bone over here. And then what cares, right? You lose mana every turn.
[6982.36s -> 6992.36s]  That's all right. Brown belt blocks next attack plus attacks or chaos. Add wild tile and a curse.
[6993.16s -> 7003.51s]  I'm not sure what a curse does, but one wild tile for two teeth is kind of cool.
[7004.79s -> 7023.64s]  I'm going for it. All right, let's do this poop in the way. Let's kill you.
[7025.72s -> 7028.23s]  I got out of wild. Oh, that's
[7040.26s -> 7043.94s]  all right. Sorry. I just like choked on air. That was ridiculous. I'm sorry. I tried to meet
[7043.94s -> 7049.22s]  as fast as I could. I got a wild tile here. We can gum up the mill. It's gonna happen again.
[7049.78s -> 7061.02s]  Maybe I should, maybe we should do bones. Do it again. All right. I gotta stop fucking around.
[7066.06s -> 7072.89s]  Don't fuck around. I mean, I know I could have used it again, but
[7075.13s -> 7083.54s]  curse insta kills enemies. What? Why would that be a downside? All right. I've got wilds here.
[7084.42s -> 7093.18s]  I could go here. I could start to build out a big bone, which would probably better this way.
[7093.18s -> 7102.34s]  Actually, no, it's going to take too long. I'm just going to do what's going to do over here.
[7102.34s -> 7116.68s]  I'm just going to throw a bone right in the middle. And then I'm going to move this out here.
[7118.55s -> 7130.98s]  And so if I block that, this is their shit, not mine. Right. So I have to block it with my own
[7130.98s -> 7155.67s]  shit. Okay. I'm safe. All right. Let's do gum. I need to do poops.
[7157.08s -> 7165.50s]  But let's just gum this because I wanted to get rid of it. Destroy tiles and touch.
[7165.50s -> 7171.94s]  I kind of want to know what this does. Take an area to destroy. I just want to know what it does.
[7173.78s -> 7180.17s]  Okay. So it just destroys all the tiles touching that one. I should have destroyed the curse.
[7181.21s -> 7185.94s]  Yeah, that would have been a smart idea, but I would have gotten rid of the bones.
[7186.66s -> 7220.44s]  All right. Let's set up, uh, bring this down. I could kill this, but I'm going to take a hit.
[7221.40s -> 7244.78s]  What's going to do more damage? Probably this. Uh, and then I just got to throw a tooth at you.
[7244.78s -> 7260.04s]  If I can make it work. I don't really have any great set up here. I can go up and then over
[7260.76s -> 7277.72s]  and then heal and I heal a booger down and then right. Good booger. I'm just going to do it.
[7278.52s -> 7290.23s]  Probably fucking this whole thing up, but whatever. Let's get rid of the curse
[7291.19s -> 7306.92s]  and then, I don't know, let's go. And then, uh, that was kind of fun to do that because now I do
[7306.92s -> 7346.74s]  this. It's only one damage. Oh fuck. Keep it going. Is that he's in front of the poop, isn't he?
[7347.46s -> 7368.50s]  All right. Poop on the left, kill thing in the middle. This is two damage though, isn't it?
[7368.50s -> 7391.50s]  See what. And now I could just nonchalantly throw a tooth at you and then get wild in there.
[7392.14s -> 7403.45s]  Do another one. Another one. Good. Now, I mean, it's impossible for me not to get something here.
[7403.45s -> 7413.91s]  So wild. Uh, it doesn't matter. I mean, I could have done something. I mean, that's cool. Pretty
[7413.91s -> 7428.47s]  cool. It doesn't matter the play there. You just got to kill it. Ooh. Plus one damage this turn.
[7428.47s -> 7438.52s]  It's only two P, but for this turn only or plus one damage and life gain. It takes three rooms
[7438.52s -> 7454.02s]  to charge. Which drug do I want? That's a good question. I mean, is this permanent? If it's
[7454.02s -> 7459.80s]  permanent, then just use it every single second to get it. Or this is just, you can. Yeah. Yeah,
[7459.80s -> 7469.74s]  that's probably better. Peeper. I'm a peeper. I have ADHD. Get the ADDY. Okay. I see what you're
[7469.74s -> 7483.10s]  doing there. All right. So, uh, should I do a huge poop here? I could do one, two, three, four,
[7483.10s -> 7509.13s]  five, six. No, I could do five. So I'm gonna do it. Yeah, I'm just gonna do five. Not like it
[7509.13s -> 7513.45s]  matters. I'm just gonna do it in the middle anyways. Uh, wait. Is it possible? No. Whatever.
[7513.45s -> 7525.94s]  Just do it. Could I have done six? I got a bone too. Move it out of the way. I'm not going to use
[7525.94s -> 7538.79s]  this because it's not going to hurt him. But let's, uh, I can do another turn. Can I hurt, can I hit,
[7539.03s -> 7546.74s]  hit it with something? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Hold
[7546.74s -> 7555.50s]  on. Slow down. Hold on. Wait. I think, can I kill him? Plus one. I can do this two, four. I can do
[7555.50s -> 7565.34s]  plus three damage for this turn. Hold on. So that's three. I can do this twice so I can hit him for
[7566.94s -> 7579.30s]  what? Like I can do a shitload of damage right now. The teeth. Hit him with the teeth. Oh yeah.
[7583.94s -> 7587.62s]  All right, buddy. It's time for you to take an absolute shitload of damage.
[7587.62s -> 7607.91s]  It's five, 10 damage. Oh, that feels pretty good. It's out of wild too. You know what? Fuck it.
[7607.91s -> 7624.20s]  Let's add, let's just fill the board with wilds. Okay. I'm looking for shit here. Shit and piss.
[7626.09s -> 7633.82s]  Uh, I could just kill him, I think. Can I? There's a lot of different wild scenarios here. Uh,
[7634.06s -> 7641.19s]  uh, I think I can kill him if I just do poo. So hold on, get this over here.
[7645.86s -> 7656.01s]  That's poo. Hold on. Cause that's one, two, three, four. It's not enough.
[7657.05s -> 7670.25s]  No, we'll bring that back. Go this way. Shit. That's a lot to look at. Uh, I'm just gonna do it.
[7672.10s -> 7680.92s]  I, I, yeah, I'm just gonna go for it. So let's move this. Just, I'm just gonna just connect it.
[7680.92s -> 7685.96s]  I got plenty more wilds and shit too. So who cares? So I'm just going to cover up the you
[7687.22s -> 7704.55s]  and then I'm going to hit you in the face. Cursed. How did I get cursed? Oh fuck. That's how. All
[7704.55s -> 7718.42s]  right. Let's just kill him. One. Can I kill him right now? I just need poo. I could do four bones
[7718.42s -> 7730.70s]  on the left. Yeah, there it is. Goodbye. Nice. If you match seven curse, you instantly die. That's
[7730.70s -> 7744.65s]  not good. Rat heart. May gain soul hearts or modeling clay. Copy a trinket. May gain soul
[7744.65s -> 7757.59s]  heart. Or I can copy one of my trinkets. What do I have for a trinket right now? What's the scenario
[7757.59s -> 7764.70s]  how this plays out though? Is it just in the beginning of a room? Let's try it. See what
[7764.70s -> 7778.60s]  happens. All right. Spells hurt more. Spells cost less or reroll spell cost. Spin the wheel.
[7780.18s -> 7790.01s]  Spin the fucking wheel. Spells hurt more is absolute. I'm taking that. Pick a spell to modify.
[7790.01s -> 7798.02s]  Um, this one does three damage now. Okay. That's pretty fucking good. Spells cost less. I'm going
[7798.02s -> 7805.46s]  to do it to that as well. Check this shit out. Ready? This thing is going to be two. It's only
[7805.46s -> 7840.79s]  two. I can either spin the wheel or I can buy a heart. Set. Yeah. Yep. Let's take a look at that.
[7840.79s -> 7846.66s]  That's going to be, I mean, I'm going to be, I'm going to wipe everybody out. If I just only need
[7846.66s -> 7855.94s]  to focus on just match poos and I have a four damage spell that I can use many times I want.
[7855.94s -> 7873.54s]  Pooh wizard. Let's go. Four damage for two poops. Holy shit. That's ridiculous.
[7875.85s -> 7888.23s]  I can kill two things right now. Let's go right down the middle. Yeah. I'll put this over here.
[7888.87s -> 7904.12s]  Let's take a look at our new move. Bang. Huh? They, I, spell resisted. I can't kill those.
[7908.58s -> 7912.82s]  No, you can't do spells against these stone mushrooms. That's what that icon means.
[7913.70s -> 7922.52s]  This is the room that I get the set right after getting my awesome new build.
[7928.54s -> 7937.64s]  That sucks. This is horrible. I have to, okay, we get bones. I would have put the pooh here
[7937.64s -> 7950.25s]  if I had even remotely had thought this is a possibility. Um, wait. Okay. So I go,
[7950.97s -> 7964.25s]  this is one damage. I could kill one of these. Oh, fuck. How many bones can I throw? One,
[7964.25s -> 7972.82s]  no matter the scenario. I mean, I, I think it's time to set up a potential re ridiculous scenario.
[7972.82s -> 7983.98s]  No, I'm only going to be able to throw one bone. How long is it going to take me to do? I'll take
[7983.98s -> 7989.98s]  one. I'll take, I'll have one heart left. What'd you beat? Then I, next round I can do three,
[7990.54s -> 8005.59s]  three. Fuck it. Let's do it. Who cares? You know what I'm saying? All right. All right. All right.
[8006.55s -> 8017.32s]  Let's go. See you later. Hopefully this kills the thing in the back or at least the, hopefully
[8017.32s -> 8025.62s]  this does enough damage. Get the guy in the front. Oh yes. That was a really bad room for what I just
[8025.62s -> 8041.13s]  built splash damage attack. So wait, could I activate the addy like three times activate
[8041.13s -> 8053.48s]  splash damage attack and then use my stick. It's sick, but I mean, that's kind of, that's,
[8053.48s -> 8060.78s]  that's too pricey. Is it though? If we're going glass cannon, I might as well stuff it too expensive
[8060.78s -> 8067.66s]  50% of blind, but that's a, this is four, this one's six, 50% chance of not blinding an enemy
[8067.66s -> 8082.66s]  for four bones. You start from zero at every turn. Shit. That's right. Yeah. That's right.
[8082.66s -> 8105.86s]  That's true. All right. What do we got? Let's see what I want to do here. Start. Let's put down
[8105.86s -> 8112.82s]  some shit. I'm going to go right down the middle and then we're going to kill the shit on. Oh man,
[8112.82s -> 8120.73s]  this is so fantastic. Look at this. I did eight damage, but what's the most, what's the most
[8120.73s -> 8130.82s]  threatening thing here? I need to know. I want is the other thing. We're going in the back. Yeah.
[8131.22s -> 8146.41s]  I don't even know what these things do, but I don't want to know. Okay. I can throw a tooth.
[8146.41s -> 8156.71s]  I can throw a bone. I need more foos. Get some piss. Now let's do piss. Bring down the goo.
[8157.43s -> 8162.39s]  Hold on. Wait, hold on a second. Two, four. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8163.64s -> 8171.22s]  Bone, bone damage. Bingo. Right. Yeah. That's a good, that's a play cause then I could
[8171.22s -> 8184.82s]  throw this once and it'll kill it. Six teeth. I'm just going to do the safe bone play. So this is
[8185.62s -> 8192.89s]  two, four, six, two, four, six. Bang. Let's throw this, kill this thing right off the bat.
[8195.34s -> 8210.68s]  Game sucks. Blind enemies. Yeah. No, I, this is actually really cool. All right. So we're
[8210.68s -> 8215.13s]  going to attack. It's going to hit there. I don't have any shits to line up, but I could throw a
[8215.13s -> 8222.07s]  tooth, which will give me some wilds. Actually I could throw, can I throw more than one tooth
[8222.07s -> 8251.02s]  is the question. I could do, I could do this. Okay. Hold on. Do this. Yup. I'm getting,
[8251.02s -> 8267.61s]  all right. I'm getting a little fucking. All right. Slow down. No more. Okay. Okay. Done.
[8281.94s -> 8293.48s]  What do I do about this? I can do down gum booger and then booger. We're going to break the tiles
[8293.48s -> 8320.33s]  here. Right here. Okay. Then we're going to go right here. Very cool. Damn it. Bad room.
[8322.60s -> 8326.20s]  Absolutely terrible room. Did they know what build I just made? What the hell?
[8327.24s -> 8345.48s]  I might have to try to do seven here. If I go all the way back here, like here,
[8346.36s -> 8355.26s]  I could do three. No, it's not going to work. Maybe this way. No, maybe this way. No,
[8356.06s -> 8371.27s]  I could do six. Is that going to take too long? That shit's going to take too long.
[8371.27s -> 8382.54s]  You can do seven and two turns. Can I though? Seven bones? That's not possible.
[8383.42s -> 8401.61s]  If I go, I could do four poos and one P. What do you see that? Wait, hold on. That's not terrible.
[8402.17s -> 8421.06s]  Let's go right here. Just do it because for fun, because we want to. Now I got a P set up. I can't
[8421.06s -> 8425.86s]  do this anyway. So that's yeah. I know I, I do have a pretty good P set up here, but P,
[8425.86s -> 8429.30s]  I don't think P is that very good for seven and you only get what? Five? Maybe. I don't know.
[8429.30s -> 8443.22s]  We'll see. I might be in some trouble here though. Cause if I go the free teeth column on the right,
[8443.86s -> 8460.20s]  what do you mean? I could set up P. If I do this, bring two down and then I mean that's six.
[8461.08s -> 8473.75s]  I'm just going to go for that. Knock back, right? Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? Knock back,
[8473.75s -> 8481.53s]  right? Teeth. Teeth. Teeth. I'm not seeing this. Teeth. I can do four on one move.
[8482.49s -> 8490.46s]  Why am I not seeing this? Second, I got two, three, three, one, four, two, do seven teeth.
[8492.36s -> 8496.41s]  I, I, I see what you, I see you. I see what you're saying.
[8502.70s -> 8511.91s]  Fuck. Okay. Seven teeth. What does it do? I can't do it this round. I have to get, I have to take a
[8511.91s -> 8522.18s]  hit. Am I safe? Oh, that's right. I have to poo there. Okay. You're right. That's true.
[8522.74s -> 8533.02s]  I forgot about it. All right. I hope this works. Otherwise the runs over. Thank God.
[8539.90s -> 8545.64s]  Destroy a column of tiles. I have too many bones, too many things that require bones.
[8545.64s -> 8559.43s]  Copies spell at random. Let's take that. Bumble versus shy gal. Unmask and smash.
[8562.79s -> 8571.29s]  New, new boss. Copies spell at random. Should I just do it? I mean, what am I going to do? Just
[8571.29s -> 8574.89s]  not do it. Just do it right now. Whatever it is. What if it's a bone? What if it's a seven bone?
[8575.77s -> 8595.35s]  It might be. Oh shit. It's a throwable stick. Unmasked. All right. Hold on. Now, um,
[8596.23s -> 8605.77s]  I could do poop right now. Let's put it right in the middle.
[8607.43s -> 8626.55s]  Whack. Can I kill you right now? I just, I just want to. Yes. This is an insane build. It really
[8626.55s -> 8633.82s]  is really good. I might get screwed later though. Free spell at low HP. May add poison to attacks.
[8634.54s -> 8645.85s]  What is low HP? What would that would be considered low? Half a heart? Or would I have right now?
[8645.85s -> 8657.69s]  Probably half a heart. May add poison. Not will add poison. It may add poison. What's that
[8657.69s -> 8670.44s]  percentage though? I want the free spell. All right. 21 coins. What do we got over here?
[8672.84s -> 8688.42s]  Spell costs less. Oh, I can't break it. I can't break the game. Cancel. Too bad.
[8689.14s -> 8705.86s]  Cancel. Well, let's at least take a heart. Spin the wheel. Wait. Spell costs less. Reroll spell
[8705.86s -> 8709.86s]  costs. What does spell charge? Well, I guess that that's okay. I see what that means.
[8711.48s -> 8718.46s]  Copies a spell. It's just a, I see. It'll bring it down to one room. That might not be a horrible
[8718.46s -> 8728.97s]  thing to do. I mean, there's a wheel. So obviously everyone wants me to spin the wheel. I'll have
[8728.97s -> 8742.54s]  enough to do one more thing. That's absolutely incredible. 33%, 33% more health and we'll,
[8742.54s -> 8753.22s]  we'll do this. Wait. Reroll spell. No. We have to get the, uh, open the box.
[8754.34s -> 8775.67s]  Granny teeth? And I have one more coin, which that doesn't look right. The Halls of Belial.
[8776.55s -> 8792.90s]  Haven't been here before. This is a new content. What do these do? Can I look at it? Is there any
[8793.14s -> 8802.25s]  see what this does? You just get one tooth. Oh, all right. These guys are spell resistant. What's
[8802.25s -> 8821.45s]  with all the spell resistant? That sucks. Gum up the one on the right. Teeth. Put the music back
[8821.45s -> 8830.01s]  up. Uh, I'm just going to do, let's do the safe play here and dump somebody else. Or I could do,
[8830.01s -> 8845.30s]  I could set up a seven teeth scenario. Possible. It can take a while though. If I go this way,
[8845.30s -> 8856.76s]  I can do, so if I go that way and then this way, so if I, okay, hold on and then bring this
[8858.42s -> 8867.24s]  up and then one tooth. Wait, hold on. I don't want to do this wrong. It would have to be here
[8868.54s -> 8872.46s]  and then one tooth. No, I can, I think, I don't think I can, I don't think I can do it.
[8872.46s -> 8887.13s]  I'm going to do the bottom row. Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened? What happened? What? No,
[8887.13s -> 8892.55s]  I tried to put it back. I tried to put it back. I tried to put it back. What? No, I want to put
[8892.55s -> 8900.18s]  it back. I didn't put it back. Ah, fucked it up. It's, I fucked it. It's, I fucked it up.
[8900.82s -> 8913.10s]  That sucks. Okay. That's bad. Um, new plan. I got, I'm sorry guys. I got to go with a new plan here.
[8913.98s -> 8936.07s]  Hook, use the hook. Hook, use the hook. Hook, use the hook. What am I using the hook on?
[8938.39s -> 8947.96s]  Do one, two, three. If I break this, it's, it'll break too much, won't it? This is going to destroy
[8947.96s -> 8961.34s]  all this. Yeah, no, I'm not going to do that. Seven teeth spotted. Yeah. It's too much stress.
[8961.34s -> 8969.13s]  Okay. If I go one, two, three. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to take a hit, but we're going to get
[8969.13s -> 9017.74s]  seven teeth. Damn it. God damn it. Taking a lot of damage. Too much for my comfort. Wait,
[9017.74s -> 9038.97s]  I can't whack them. They were, they won't hurt them. Charges random usable item. Blinding attack.
[9044.18s -> 9048.98s]  That's so expensive. I'm never going to use that, but I'm never going to use the
[9048.98s -> 9054.97s]  lemon either. I mean, this is a guaranteed blinding attack instead of 50% blinding of enemies.
[9055.69s -> 9074.17s]  Okay. Let's think about it. Let's, let's, let's do, let's poop. Right. Okay. Who is the most,
[9074.17s -> 9087.91s]  what's the most dangerous thing here? The middle bro, I guess. I don't know. I'm going to kill this
[9087.91s -> 9099.08s]  though. Let's go on the left side. Okay. Right down the middle. You got to be fucking kidding me.
[9115.14s -> 9136.46s]  Fuck. Bad. Cancel. Fuck. What should I break? I have this. Not even worth done. Oh boy. Teeth.
[9137.02s -> 9155.70s]  Okay. Let's kill everything. Kill, let's kill everything. Shit. Oh, how do I kill this?
[9156.50s -> 9161.22s]  How do I kill you? I don't even know how to kill this thing. I can't take a curve. I can't take a
[9161.30s -> 9167.18s]  wild right now. Cause if it goes right there, then I'm going to be in big trouble. Look at,
[9167.18s -> 9180.81s]  look at this bro. Do it? I don't think that's a good idea. It's you have to do it when his
[9180.81s -> 9191.43s]  neck is up. But when is his neck up? No, I'm not doing it. No way. Fuck. Um, okay. Now his neck
[9191.43s -> 9197.43s]  is up and there's two attacks coming on this side. I need a miracle right now. What's my miracle?
[9200.74s -> 9217.54s]  Take a chance for once in your life. Pee into poo. Make the pee. Can I do only four
[9217.54s -> 9249.75s]  peas though? This is important. I'm in trouble. Pee and bones. Ah, bone. Oh, guys. I don't know.
[9249.75s -> 9256.14s]  I could do this. Let me do that and do, and oh, but wait, hold on. Let's do this.
[9256.14s -> 9265.35s]  Right. Oh, and that's an extra bone. Oh, that's a lot of bone. That is a six bone, but ah,
[9266.55s -> 9272.78s]  how many bones do I get to throw with six? Holy shit. This might actually, I might win.
[9275.54s -> 9282.63s]  It's three throws. Okay. Everybody settle down. Two, four, six. That's four damage a throw.
[9283.88s -> 9292.14s]  And then I can throw three times. One, two, three, and then up.
[9294.57s -> 9313.13s]  And then up again. Here we go. Eight fucking damage. Okay. And let's blinding attack on you.
[9313.85s -> 9333.91s]  And then on, fuck, this is going to get tricky. One heart. Bad. Although I can't kill this thing.
[9334.71s -> 9342.50s]  I could do a couple of whacks. I can't kill this thing with a whack though. Eight health. Fuck off.
[9343.38s -> 9367.29s]  Going right in the middle. And then kill these two and then give her the poop in the middle.
[9368.09s -> 9393.08s]  Sounds good. All right. Poop again. Can I do poo again in one turn? Or is it bones? I'm going to
[9393.08s -> 9401.90s]  throw a bone. Try to set the poop up. All right. So what if I go like this? No, no, that's too far.
[9401.90s -> 9411.50s]  What about down here? Let's go over here and then set up this. Just, just do a poop setup run.
[9412.22s -> 9419.54s]  I think I'm just going to throw. No, there's no reason to throw the bone. I just need to do poop
[9420.98s -> 9426.20s]  or bone and teeth. Yeah, I'm just going to do it. I need that might as well.
[9437.59s -> 9449.06s]  Shit. I'm trying to hit the toilet paper.
[9470.46s -> 9486.12s]  I can poop next round. In fact, I want more poos. I'm going right here. No, no, it's not even worth
[9486.12s -> 9496.07s]  it. It's not worth it. Just let it play out. I can poop next round anyway. So speaking of that,
[9496.07s -> 9502.31s]  I can go over and then up or I can go just pull it this way and I get it for free
[9502.87s -> 9509.75s]  without having to do two moves. And then would you look at that? I can set up for a booger
[9510.39s -> 9529.62s]  next round. Can I? Sort of. I cannot hurt this. I'm going to hit it anyways. It's fun.
[9538.73s -> 9545.05s]  All right. I'm safe. I'm just going to set up another. I'm going to set up another poop.
[9545.69s -> 9573.14s]  Could be this, right? Yeah. There it is. See you later. I need help.
[9578.15s -> 9581.67s]  It's all enemies rerolls a row of tiles. That's really good.
[9584.46s -> 9594.74s]  Heart bad. This is really good because I can activate the addy with this.
[9596.74s -> 9609.75s]  Right. That would be a huge, huge deal. Yeah. I don't want the random spell. It's too, it's too
[9609.75s -> 9635.02s]  much. Oh, bumbo versus sangry. Go for the soft spot. Okay. I can, I can do a poop right now,
[9635.74s -> 9658.71s]  which is good. Let's get it on there. Let's see if, can I hurt him? Yes, I can. Oh, he,
[9658.71s -> 9669.56s]  when you hit him once, he closes. He has to open back up again. I get it. Okay. We need to go. I
[9669.56s -> 9680.90s]  got to get pee because I need pee and then poo so I can kill him in like one hit. Cursed. Oh, oh boy.
[9682.79s -> 9687.59s]  Holy shit. He's right here. Okay. Pee and then poo. Is there, is it possible to do pee and poo
[9687.59s -> 9697.59s]  right now? I don't think so. Let me see. I can do pee, but I don't have a poo set up. Can I take
[9697.59s -> 9715.54s]  one hit? I can't take one hit. He'll hit you more than once. Oh, he's going to hit you three times.
[9723.64s -> 9734.12s]  Is it, what's the other play here? Is to gum him up for a run? Do the blind attack. Will that
[9734.12s -> 9755.02s]  actually do it? How long are they blind for? I'm going to try it. I'll try it. Let's go for the
[9755.02s -> 9770.04s]  attack with the blind. Blind is RNG, but could save the whole thing. Let's try it. Oh, he's back.
[9770.04s -> 9783.99s]  All right. So now blind him. Will this work? Is he going to just run up to me? I mean, I just pushed
[9783.99s -> 9811.43s]  him. He's really far back now. Please don't kill me. One, two, three. Oh, I'm dead. I could do pee,
[9811.43s -> 9818.07s]  but it's not going to help. Pee and then maybe throw a wild in and hope I get RNG.
[9822.60s -> 9837.27s]  Boogers. Battery and boogers. He's knocked back. That doesn't help me though. And then hold him
[9837.27s -> 9848.17s]  there. So you say and go bang bang and then just hold in place. Just booger him. I'm going to try
[9848.17s -> 9876.74s]  it. Stuck right here, I think. Oh, should I destroy the carcasses? Give me shit. I need poo
[9879.96s -> 9906.62s]  over here. Oh, should I press it? I don't think I should press it. No, I thought he was, I thought
[9906.62s -> 9915.93s]  he was frozen. Oh, it's only one. He gets three turns. Fuck. That guy sucks. Damn. Damn it.
[9917.37s -> 9950.04s]  Damn it. Oh no. Damn it. Super booger. I'm so sad. Oh, I'll just do poo. It's better that way.
[9950.84s -> 9973.53s]  That was a cool run. Yeah, it was. Oh well. It was cool. Permadeath? Yeah, there is permadeath.
[9973.53s -> 9977.64s]  You just start over. But every time you beat it, you unlock new stuff.
[9996.79s -> 10008.63s]  Why'd I do that? Hold that. No, I'm an idiot. I'm a dumb as a sack of rock.
[10009.43s -> 10043.74s]  I thought I could do seven. Yeah, we know. I don't. I could do this. I'm gonna get hit though.
[10044.46s -> 10066.89s]  So many teeth. I'm so sad that that build was so cool. Maybe I can do a similar one.
[10071.35s -> 10093.30s]  Change any tile to a wild. Yeah, immediately. Okay, this is a lot of boogers, but we go poo
[10093.30s -> 10116.52s]  first always. I guess I probably shouldn't put it there, but I can. I'll be fine. Who do I gum?
[10118.22s -> 10148.50s]  Huh? Do this. Not in any danger. I'm not in any real danger or anything. All right. Bones.
[10158.82s -> 10180.50s]  Cool. Show Otto. Show Otto. Okay, how many throws do I get? Two. Yeah. I'll do this.
[10183.75s -> 10194.90s]  Get you with a tooth. Now you have to show Otto. Otto's such a good boy. He's such a good boy.
[10211.08s -> 10215.32s]  Valve announced the new Half-Life game. Yeah, that's pretty big news right now, isn't it?
[10215.32s -> 10225.18s]  That is a pretty big deal. Change any tile. Okay, I need to pee. Although, I have a terrible
[10225.18s -> 10235.30s]  setup here to do this maybe. I can just do it now. Yeah, I need it now. Okay, I gotta start
[10235.30s -> 10254.22s]  killing stuff, you know? Half-Life VR. Yeah, hopefully it's good. I hope it's good. I got
[10254.22s -> 10260.09s]  a bone next turn. I'm gonna put this over here because I'm gonna kill these things in the middle.
[10260.81s -> 10292.17s]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. That's actually a real uh-oh. I'm not gonna kill this. How many throws do I have?
[10292.73s -> 10309.69s]  Pretty you. Pretty you. Ow. I actually kind of somehow nonchalantly ended up making this way worse.
[10310.65s -> 10325.67s]  Um, the soundtrack isn't great. Uh, I think it's okay. I'd like a little more variety, though.
[10326.31s -> 10347.11s]  Try to make some wilds. I'm kind of in trouble. Uh, do I have enough to... I could do the extra
[10347.11s -> 10349.99s]  turn, but that's not... I don't think it's gonna do anything for me. I guess I could do the extra
[10349.99s -> 10360.28s]  turn and try to make a wild. Let's do tooth. That'll kill that. And then I could do the
[10360.28s -> 10370.98s]  extra. Yeah, let's do that. And with this, now I have any tile as a wild, which I could do that,
[10372.73s -> 10393.00s]  which I'm just gonna do because why the hell not? Don't win yet. I do win now, though.
[10393.64s -> 10403.48s]  Yes, I do. Wait. Yes, I do. Kill the rock. What does it get? Is there something in the rock?
[10404.20s -> 10425.21s]  Should I stall and heal? Is there actual shit in the rock? There's nothing in the rock. Change
[10425.29s -> 10429.53s]  anything into a wild. Okay, so let me... We're just gonna stall, apparently.
[10449.90s -> 10460.90s]  Am I really gonna do this? What do you mean wasted poo rock? I don't need... I don't need seven.
[10461.46s -> 10476.89s]  Why do I need seven? Hit rock with poop. This doesn't do anything. Uh, well, I want to get
[10476.89s -> 10480.73s]  rid of the bones, though, because if I am gonna just try to get this farm wilds to heal, then
[10482.89s -> 10490.87s]  that's the plan, then. There's a wild right there. Don't throw that.
[10491.75s -> 10502.73s]  Okay, I want to move. I'm gonna do anything. Okay, let's... I need pee to farm the wilds, too.
[10503.69s -> 10508.89s]  I got three hits here. All right, let's bring this with pee. Let's get some pee here.
[10508.89s -> 10522.68s]  You go down and then over. Whatever. Rock doesn't do anything. Yeah, I know. There we go.
[10523.72s -> 10530.94s]  So let's make this... Let's bring this over here. I gotta make sure I don't actually activate this
[10530.94s -> 10562.47s]  somehow. All right, we're good. Here's the heal, right? Yes. Let's go. Floor one. Plus three
[10562.47s -> 10566.71s]  movement. I'm never gonna have that. Gain one to two coins. I mean, that's just free money every
[10566.71s -> 10584.36s]  couple rooms. Vote to cancel. This is what we're playing. There is no vote to change the game.
[10584.36s -> 10596.84s]  This is the game that I'm playing. What's going on in here? If that vote passes, then we times
[10596.84s -> 10601.00s]  two the amount of time... I will spend a week playing this game. I will spend the next seven
[10601.00s -> 10607.19s]  straight days playing this game. If you... What are you talking about? I mean, I'm not gonna do
[10607.19s -> 10622.28s]  that, but I'm having... This is a good game. Well, free coins. Let's take them. I don't know what this
[10622.28s -> 10633.85s]  dude does. Uh-oh. Kenshi. Turned him a lot about playing Bumble for seven days. Turned him a lot
[10633.85s -> 10640.49s]  about pooping his pants. All right, let's set this up down and then I'm gonna do this. Freeze him.
[10644.54s -> 10652.25s]  And then... I think that's fine. He can't do... Well, he's gonna move twice.
[10653.29s -> 10662.81s]  But that's okay. I think he's just gonna get really close. But that's okay because... Do I have an
[10662.81s -> 10675.64s]  opportunity for a poop right now? I can throw a tooth at him. I could set up a five poop.
[10675.64s -> 10692.44s]  I could do one, two, three, four, five. Five head. I mean, I could go... I could set up a
[10693.24s -> 10713.38s]  down here and then up and then... All right. Cool. Might be able to kill him right now.
[10714.10s -> 10732.65s]  Ooh. You break up into little things. Right down Main Street. Let's go. Oh, every time you hit him.
[10734.62s -> 10738.62s]  All right. That's actually a pretty good thing to do. What is this? Are these extra poops?
[10739.34s -> 10757.78s]  Well, that's terrible. That sucks. I think I'm gonna have to...
[10760.26s -> 10774.58s]  I just... I don't know. Make a tooth. Yeah. Maybe it'll knock him back. Yes, it will.
[10774.58s -> 10778.28s]  And he destroys all that shit. Did he go over the poo?
[10779.90s -> 10790.57s]  Fuck. How am I supposed to clear all this? This is so much stuff to clear.
[10800.78s -> 10811.18s]  It's just... Wait. It's hiding them. Oh. That makes more sense. I guess I'm... Shit. This guy's
[10811.18s -> 10829.96s]  gonna kill me. I think this is R.I.P. Yeah. This sucked. I think I just need to get lucky and do
[10829.96s -> 10841.98s]  poo, right? I'm just gonna hope that there's a poo up here. Wait. How do I... I don't understand.
[10841.98s -> 10858.33s]  I thought it was hiding them. No? It is, but they have to be revealed before... Shit. Move the row
[10858.33s -> 10866.68s]  and it'll uncover the one that I'm on. Well, I guess I'm gonna do this. Damn it. I was just
[10866.68s -> 10870.52s]  where the shot... Oh, he didn't even attack me. He didn't even attack. He didn't attack yet.
[10871.94s -> 10886.70s]  What? Uh-oh. Okay. He hit the poop shield. Yeah, he usually spits and he goes over the poop shield.
[10888.70s -> 10905.03s]  So this is... It's the shape of these that matter. Which one is poo? Do we know? Teeth? Tooth and
[10905.03s -> 10917.80s]  wind. Tooth and wind. Where... I guess I... Yeah, I could do this, right? Yeah. It's only one damage,
[10917.80s -> 10946.47s]  though. Got it. That was close. That was really close. Hmm. Charge any item. More green tiles.
[10946.95s -> 10957.32s]  Uh... Damn it. I wish that was more poop tiles. Charge any item. What do I have for item right now?
[10957.32s -> 10967.59s]  I guess... Does the... I have the coin. I don't think that's worth it. It just means I can get
[10967.59s -> 10971.75s]  two coins every two rooms. One to two coins. Yeah, but I can only use this once, right?
[10972.55s -> 10977.86s]  Well, let's get the nose gobble. Let's try to build around green. All right. What do we got?
[10978.50s -> 10989.32s]  Spells hurt more. I mean, it's so simple just to make... To do this... Try to this again.
[10990.36s -> 11003.02s]  Try the same run again. I could try it. Let's see if I can do it again. And then re-roll
[11003.02s -> 11008.38s]  spell cost. Re-roll spell cost. Should I try to... But what if I make it larger?
[11014.20s -> 11023.98s]  Re-roll it to boogers. Wait. That's what that does? So there's a one in five chance that this will be
[11023.98s -> 11058.60s]  rolled into a booger. The worst one possible. Speed? I get an extra move. That's pretty huge,
[11058.60s -> 11073.29s]  actually. That's really huge. That's a big deal. Run fucked, run saved. Yeah, poop is not vital
[11073.29s -> 11079.29s]  at all. But it still is because I still... It hurts a lot. I just did the... It does another damage.
[11083.50s -> 11092.18s]  Three damage. It was four bones. No, but poop is so important anyways. And I got so much more nose
[11092.18s -> 11127.06s]  goblins. Well, go for five bones. Might as well. And then whack the fuck out of the middle. What
[11127.06s -> 11147.82s]  just happened? Why is it... What? Okay. Those die when you have them all in the ground. Oh.
[11148.78s -> 11155.46s]  Okay. Yeah. For those that die, I can't... These things, I cannot hit these with this... They are
[11155.46s -> 11164.09s]  resistant to all spells. Well, we're just going to booger. Booger the middle too, I guess.
[11165.37s -> 11190.33s]  And then I could do... I could do some extra moves here. Any tile of wild? Wait, did I already have
[11190.33s -> 11198.70s]  it? No. Fuck. I think I might have... Do some poop here. I could do up. I could do up, up, and then
[11198.70s -> 11218.06s]  wild in the middle. And then stick that right in the middle. Well, I don't really want to destroy
[11218.06s -> 11233.27s]  anything. I got to knock all these guys down. That's a pain. I could throw a bone over here and
[11233.27s -> 11246.31s]  then whack the middle again. Sticky them again. I got to deal with those moles last. I'm going
[11246.31s -> 11254.73s]  to throw a bone. I have three moves, so I could just... One, two... Yeah, whatever. Fuck it.
[11254.73s -> 11276.47s]  Fuck it. Like it matters. Okay. Can I kill you? I can kill you now with teeth.
[11277.35s -> 11283.19s]  And then I... Do I have a... I can do glue in the middle. I can do a big... I can do... Okay, hold on.
[11283.19s -> 11290.97s]  What does seven glue do? That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I don't think I can... I
[11290.97s -> 11298.82s]  can't do it. I can only do like five... Wait, hold on. If I go up here, that would be one, two,
[11299.62s -> 11310.82s]  three, four, five, six. But what if I go over here? That'd be one... Hold on. What if I move
[11310.82s -> 11318.82s]  it over this way? That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Right? I think I'm doing this
[11318.82s -> 11331.67s]  right. Because then I go like this. And then I go like this. Do nine boogers? What happens if... What
[11331.67s -> 11343.10s]  does that do? No, I can't do nine. One, two, three, four, five, six. Fuck. I can't do nine. Can I do
[11343.10s -> 11356.46s]  seven though? I don't know. I think I screwed it up. I can? I can't do seven. No, I can do... I
[11356.46s -> 11364.50s]  can do six. What do you mean you can? What? One, two, three, four, five, six. I can't... If I move this
[11364.50s -> 11374.04s]  way... No, I can't do it. If you just do it on the top row. I'll do six. It's not... No, it's not
[11374.04s -> 11410.60s]  worth it. Probably shouldn't do it. Whatever. Okay. These guys are a little annoying, aren't they?
[11412.36s -> 11423.78s]  You're a little irritating, aren't you? Let's get some wild bone. How many bones can I do?
[11430.57s -> 11442.34s]  Bone, bone. Don't even need the wild. Well, I have to use it though. I could go one, two, three,
[11442.34s -> 11450.89s]  four. Can I do five? I could do six bone maybe. If I do one, two, three. So you say one, two, three.
[11457.40s -> 11465.77s]  And then I could do a wild there. Wild here. No, no. Wild here. Move this over and go up.
[11466.33s -> 11476.50s]  So go... Do I have this right? Five bones wins. Am I fucking this whole thing up? One, two, three,
[11477.22s -> 11487.77s]  four. There's the wild. Okay. There's the wild. Hold on, Jeremy. Don't fuck this up yet. One...
[11487.77s -> 11515.54s]  Oh, five just wins. Don't matter. Heals one heart, lose one move. Attack a whole row.
[11516.42s -> 11535.45s]  You guys want to put on Chillstep? What do you think? Epic Chillstep.
[11545.02s -> 11548.78s]  All right. Let's put on some Chillstep for a while. Because yeah, this music is starting to like
[11549.34s -> 11559.29s]  burn into my brain. How do I turn this down though? I know you can. I know. I swear to God,
[11559.29s -> 11564.97s]  I saw it. Attack a row. That's pretty good. But heals one heart, lose one move. That's actually
[11564.97s -> 11579.70s]  bad. But this could be a big deal too. I'm always needing heals. Do the volume mixer. Yeah, but then
[11579.70s -> 11589.75s]  you lose all the audio from the game too. I'm gonna do the heal. They're both six. That's a full heart
[11589.75s -> 11611.40s]  from doing it. Where's that menu? If you use a move, is it gone forever? Only this... For me,
[11611.40s -> 11616.76s]  yes. Because it will not technically. There's two rooms. If I press this like I should have pressed
[11616.76s -> 11623.72s]  like last round, now in two rooms, this will be ready to be used again. Now, I have to collect...
[11624.52s -> 11629.32s]  I almost said claws. I have to collect bones. If I get four bones, I can use this move.
[11630.04s -> 11634.04s]  You store them until the end of the round for this character, which then you all go to zero
[11634.04s -> 11647.93s]  for all of your abilities. It's complicated. You need to read a book. All right. I think I want
[11648.66s -> 11677.32s]  wilds. I could go... I could just do... I need to poop. And then... What the fuck? What the fuck is
[11677.32s -> 11697.43s]  that? I didn't heard it. Oh, what? I don't... Okay. It still is three. Fuck me. I should have just used
[11697.43s -> 11704.31s]  that. Oh, I'm so fucking... I was so tilted from that last thing. I wasted the Lord. Oh, it's all
[11704.31s -> 11718.09s]  right. Check this out. My God. How many? One, two, three. Okay. Here we go. Ready? One, two,
[11718.09s -> 11739.06s]  three. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Did I have three turns? Okay. I just did a... Hold on.
[11739.06s -> 11755.02s]  I did a shitload of stuff there. Should I hit this guy again? Will he die if I... Should I do small or
[11755.66s -> 11763.43s]  hit the guy in the middle? Okay. Hold on a second here. Look at all these turns I have.
[11764.39s -> 11773.19s]  Give me the coins back. Okay. I could... This is gonna take a much more calculated brain than me.
[11774.55s -> 11781.37s]  There's bone, bone, bone. I could do a lot of bones here. I could move this over. So I could have
[11782.09s -> 11789.58s]  one, two, three. No, I could do five bones with a wild. Could I do seven? I could do
[11789.58s -> 11799.94s]  two. No, I could do one, two, three, four. Teeth for the heel. Oh, man. Okay. I could do seven bones.
[11799.94s -> 11807.19s]  Couldn't I? It'd have to be very strategic because it would have to be make this a wild,
[11807.19s -> 11816.62s]  make this a wild, which would be one, two, three, four, five, six. If I go like that,
[11826.23s -> 11836.09s]  if I move over here and then I go down, down, and then make it a wild. Change this to a wild.
[11836.89s -> 11861.91s]  But let's go. Still, still not doing so well. Okay. I need teeth now. How many teeth can I do?
[11862.63s -> 11874.01s]  I could do one, two, three. I do five because if I do this, I can do the one on the right. Can I do...
[11874.01s -> 11885.14s]  Wait, I can... No, no, no. I can do one of that. I could do... Move this down and then move one to
[11885.14s -> 11900.14s]  the right. Go up. I need another wild. Shit, yeah. I could still do five or six because if I go over
[11900.14s -> 11914.39s]  here, that means bring the one on the right up, bring the one on the left down. Wild on the left.
[11914.95s -> 11923.80s]  Do I have enough time to do this? Wild on the left? I don't have enough time to do this. I thought I
[11923.80s -> 11934.31s]  had one more move. Fuck. I thought I had another move. Wacky. I know. I'm just trying to set this
[11934.31s -> 11939.70s]  up for success. Who am I whacking though? Guy on the right or guy in the middle? Guy in the middle.
[11940.42s -> 11957.21s]  Streamer doesn't read chat. Yes, he does. And then let's get rid of you. Actually, go right in the
[11957.21s -> 11966.68s]  middle. Uh, no. Right in the middle. Why do you... What happened? What happened? I can't swing because
[11966.68s -> 11978.60s]  you're in the... He's in the air. Oh, what have I done with this one? Okay. I can kill this though
[11978.60s -> 11982.04s]  and then I can heal. There's nobody attacking me right now, so let's just do what I was going
[11982.04s -> 11992.36s]  to do before, which is wild. Bring this down. I'll whip it at you. Insta-dead. Just kidding.
[11993.61s -> 12008.38s]  Heal a full heart. Good. This is Candy Crush with extra steps and it was made by Edmund McMillan.
[12009.02s -> 12030.98s]  I think I'm being stupid. Am I being stupid here? Wait. Uh, get the wild and then
[12031.70s -> 12040.14s]  put it here. That's not going to work. Uh, put... Move this down and then move this down and do that.
[12040.14s -> 12051.40s]  I don't know. Backseat. Backseat. Yeah. I mean, what is the nature of these games? You only have
[12051.40s -> 12062.30s]  two moves. Yeah. So I have to... You still have three... Yeah. I still have three moves. That
[12062.30s -> 12066.22s]  move... That's good at the very end. All right. I'm going to do... Let's do Booger and P. That's a
[12066.22s -> 12073.62s]  good one. So if I go down like this and then bring it down like that... No. Oh man. I get so... I
[12073.62s -> 12078.34s]  second guess everything I do in these games because even if there's like five ways to do it,
[12078.34s -> 12083.14s]  I will figure out somehow the sixth way that's the wrong way to do it. It just happens every time.
[12083.14s -> 12089.70s]  Uh, I'm going to go for this. I think. I think. I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet. I'm
[12089.70s -> 12106.97s]  still trying to figure that out. How about down from here? No. Let's go like this. Dumb this up,
[12110.23s -> 12118.12s]  which will then allow me to go like this, which will then allow me to change something else into
[12118.12s -> 12124.86s]  a wild. I could have two wilds somewhere over here. And where do I want those? How about...
[12125.74s -> 12134.38s]  I only have one move left. I have to kill... I have to kill this thing.
[12135.10s -> 12143.50s]  The dude right there and just throw the bone at him. But that's not going to kill it though.
[12143.50s -> 12162.04s]  I could whack it too. Okay. There's a heart scenario. I've got one more move to do. Let's
[12162.04s -> 12167.38s]  just... I mean, that's not going to help, but let me set up a super move for next round.
[12168.02s -> 12210.70s]  It's the first time we've seen that. Cool. Let's do a heart while out there. Right? No. Yeah.
[12213.00s -> 12224.07s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I need to bring you... fuck. Okay. Up, up, up, up. Can I do this?
[12224.79s -> 12237.18s]  I need to get P. Okay. We're going to do P, wild, and then... fuck me. Bring this up? No. Bring this
[12237.18s -> 12256.65s]  up. Okay. Am I doing it right? I hope so. I am. Wait, don't use this yet. What if I get hit?
[12264.02s -> 12275.93s]  Make a seven heart stack. Hold on. Wait a second. Just don't get hit. It'll be stunned for an extra
[12275.93s -> 12279.13s]  turn. But what... Okay. What can I make? What happens if you do seven hearts? Do you get a
[12279.13s -> 12292.50s]  permanent full heart? Do you get a soul heart? Because I would only need two more, which I could
[12292.50s -> 12300.74s]  maybe do P's. That's a soul heart? Oh. That's not really worth it. I mean, they're like,
[12300.74s -> 12309.13s]  it's not worth it. Seven hearts stack. There's a two-way poop right here. Does that work?
[12310.55s -> 12315.35s]  Try to get the seven hearts. They're worth it? Well, I'm just gonna make this a wild then,
[12315.35s -> 12327.61s]  and then see if we can make it happen. Do the two-way poop. But no, that two-way don't work.
[12328.41s -> 12342.66s]  Uh, let's see. Can I get some more wilds here? I don't think so. That's... I don't... I think
[12342.66s -> 12357.93s]  seven hearts is going to be kind of out of reach. Yeah. It's going to take too long because there's
[12357.93s -> 12365.66s]  only three P's on the board. I can't... I'll just do seven poop and then I'm just going to heal.
[12369.77s -> 12387.93s]  Oh, fuck it. Let's just do it now. Who cares? All right. Let's set up a good bone scenario.
[12388.73s -> 12421.58s]  It looks pretty good. Don't look behind you. Munker. You can miss in this game. Oh,
[12421.58s -> 12451.56s]  because he went up right... Wait, let's make it a good end. Have we seen these enemies yet? I don't
[12451.56s -> 12468.07s]  think so. This might be the first time. So, hmm. P. I'm going to do P. Get a wild in this scenario.
[12468.07s -> 12488.23s]  Down wild. Uh, these guys have a lot of health too. I'm going to go poo on the left. Then I'm
[12488.23s -> 12495.27s]  going to do... Let's set up teeth for next round, dude. One, two, three. One, two, three. I guess.
[12495.27s -> 12507.29s]  Whatever. Let's do three down. One, two. I just need a... I just need a P. If I do one, two, three,
[12507.29s -> 12513.35s]  and then one, two, three, I could kill them all potentially. Fuck it. Let's go for it. Sometimes
[12513.35s -> 12518.55s]  you got to do the big play. All right. Then up, down, and then we got one move. Um, let's go.
[12519.59s -> 12539.40s]  There's seven right there. See if this does anything. Oh, fuck. I did not know that was
[12539.40s -> 12569.77s]  going to happen. Uh... Well, nobody's attacking. What do I destroy? I don't think I want to destroy
[12569.77s -> 12579.13s]  anything. Nobody's going to move. And let's go... Yeah, green doesn't hurt you unless you attack.
[12580.09s -> 12587.00s]  So I need to wait. I could do some wilds. I think that's a good idea. Up or down? Probably,
[12587.00s -> 12596.52s]  yeah, up because I want the bone. Uh, wild for poo. Or just stick a wild on the board. Who cares,
[12596.52s -> 12614.58s]  right? Yeah, just stick a wild on the board. Right here. Whatever. Fuck. Right here. Whatever.
[12629.06s -> 12641.61s]  All right. This should be the boss, right? Loose change. Gain coins equals to next damage. What
[12641.61s -> 12651.11s]  the fuck does that mean? Gain coins equals to next damage taken. So gain...
[12651.99s -> 12661.29s]  Rudolph's a real... This one's interesting. I like that one. That seems cool. That's one coin for
[12661.29s -> 12671.75s]  every damage you take. So like one, two, three, four. Let's just do the D12. Bumble versus Gibbs.
[12671.75s -> 12684.20s]  Heavy hits are best. Let's go. Ah, heavy hits are best. What the hell does this jello cube even do?
[12686.58s -> 12689.62s]  I could do poo just to get it out and make sure I get some safety here.
[12690.82s -> 12695.14s]  One, two, three. One, two, three. Should I set up a... I'm gonna set up a huge poo, I think.
[12695.14s -> 12718.18s]  How much time do I got? Enough, right? I don't know. Yeah, I'm doing it. Now. Hold on. All right.
[12718.18s -> 12729.85s]  This is important. Ready? One, two. There's my wild. Bring this down. Let's do it. Super poop.
[12734.90s -> 12744.23s]  And I can slow you down. So I'm protected, but I need to do big hits.
[12745.19s -> 12753.54s]  Reroll a row of tiles. Which row? Seven bone or super tooth? I'm probably gonna say bones.
[12754.26s -> 12764.97s]  Just reroll the whole top row. No, I got a wild here now though. I'm thinking drag this over here
[12764.97s -> 12777.88s]  and be able to bring it down. Second top row reroll. I could... But I can make a...
[12777.88s -> 12787.16s]  This is... Right now I can just throw a tooth at him. If I do this, then I can set up... Let me try
[12787.16s -> 12797.40s]  this. Yeah, this is the one right here. Check this out. Because I'm gonna go... Next round,
[12797.40s -> 12803.18s]  I'm gonna go bang, bang. Drag this down. Seven bone. I don't want to reroll anything right now.
[12803.18s -> 12836.31s]  Let's do it. Kill. Oh, but he's dead. That was... He was just kind of a big piece of meat. I wonder
[12836.31s -> 12845.21s]  what he does if you leave him alone. More brown tiles. Damn it. Now having me reroll that thing
[12846.17s -> 12855.66s]  is a bad idea. Me having the stupid bones for the smash, it could have been... Reroll it again.
[12856.54s -> 12864.55s]  I could. It raises crit chance, but how much does that mean? More poo for more hammer. No,
[12864.55s -> 12879.26s]  the hammer is bones now. Remember? I know, but my whack is for bones. Remember I rerolled it?
[12884.98s -> 12899.46s]  Crit. I'm taking the crit. Okay, what do we got? Reroll the spell. Reroll spell cost.
[12900.50s -> 12926.95s]  Spell cost less. Reroll spell cost. On this one, you mean to try to get boogers?
[12927.67s -> 12942.01s]  But what if it's... Fuck you.
[12942.65s -> 12969.06s]  I'm gonna do spell cost less on wild, I think, because that's just been such a...
[12969.06s -> 12974.12s]  It's the only thing that's gonna keep this together. On the heal, you think?
[12977.61s -> 12982.74s]  Maybe. I'm thinking the wilds, if I could place like... Because if I do one match,
[12982.74s -> 12998.60s]  I could place two wilds instead of one. That's the play. Spin the wheel. Movement.
[12999.00s -> 13019.58s]  Now, should I reroll the spell? Yeah, I don't... I don't care about this. I really don't. I would
[13019.58s -> 13026.26s]  much rather have anything else. Wait, this is an item. I can reroll boats as I can. Pick a spell
[13026.26s -> 13040.79s]  to modify? Is this not blocked out? I don't even know what the... What was that? More bones. I don't
[13040.79s -> 13049.48s]  even know what it was. Well, this is the run here. We're gonna try. This is the... This is the third
[13049.56s -> 13059.37s]  room, third area. Six bones. Halls of Belial. Come on, my build's terrible. Can you mute the
[13059.37s -> 13065.93s]  game audio so I can take samples of you saying those bad words? Gain mana equals to most common
[13065.93s -> 13085.74s]  tile. Let's do some P. Okay, I got two wilds I can put out here now. That's a big deal. So,
[13086.70s -> 13100.23s]  super booger, I can do bang, bang, and then go up. Yep. Right? And then, fuck. Go up. Wild,
[13100.23s -> 13121.30s]  go up. Bring the wave. All frozen for two turns. Let's do another wild on... I'm gonna say bones.
[13124.54s -> 13137.72s]  We're looking for bones, so let's destroy some shit. Try to make room for bones. Not bad. Pretty
[13137.72s -> 13155.72s]  good. Okay. Not bad. Really not bad at all. Let's make this a wild. No, no. What's the best way to
[13155.72s -> 13164.50s]  do this? Drag this over one. Might be hard to do this. So, I need to do three. One, two, three.
[13165.22s -> 13172.54s]  I'm gonna have to move these around because I... I'm gonna make four every time I move it.
[13173.18s -> 13178.92s]  I can only make one. If I make one a wild, it'll just close it. So, this has to be the wild.
[13179.88s -> 13187.85s]  So, that would be one, two, three, four, five, six. Yeah, I'm gonna... it's not gonna be good.
[13187.85s -> 13193.29s]  Move the left one down. Okay, so I moved the left one down. That would be... and then one, two, three,
[13193.29s -> 13200.07s]  four. Now, if I move that left one down, then this is a wild. It'll complete it. Move the bone on the
[13200.07s -> 13204.95s]  right away. So, if I move this out of the way, then that means I got one, two, three. All right. Yeah,
[13204.95s -> 13212.95s]  that's the play. So, the play is get this one out of the way, make this a wild, move this up,
[13212.95s -> 13229.96s]  move this down, kill him. Sounds like it. Hope I'm right. So, move this up, move this up,
[13229.96s -> 13251.74s]  move this down, kill him. Holy shit, I just got a double combo. I did. And gain mana to most common
[13251.74s -> 13261.83s]  tile. Just whack. Because it's not... is it bones? It's not bones, is it? Because I could probably...
[13261.83s -> 13271.19s]  I don't know, I could kill this stuff right now. Let's whack. Spell resistant. Fuck. All right,
[13271.19s -> 13274.39s]  hold on. This is not a bad... this is not terrible because we... I'm just gonna make more and more
[13274.39s -> 13293.82s]  bones or teeth or whatever. Look at that. Lots of bones now. Let's go. All right. One, two, three.
[13294.70s -> 13310.60s]  If I go this way. All right, here we go. One, two, three. And then one, two... uh, one, two,
[13311.56s -> 13322.26s]  I think. I'm just gonna tap the next round. Because this can come over here and make three.
[13324.49s -> 13340.95s]  Yep. So, I'll make three and then bring the... yeah, let's go. So, that makes one... oh shit,
[13340.95s -> 13365.94s]  in my pants. What happened? One... okay, we're good. Just do bones. Gain gray mana or blinding
[13365.94s -> 13383.10s]  attack. Gray mana. Which is great. That's bones? Is it teeth? So, I could infinite heal, potentially.
[13383.98s -> 13398.44s]  It's teeth, okay. I think that's better than this. Rerolls a row of tiles. This one sucks.
[13399.08s -> 13410.34s]  That's too much. I could heal. I can't... there's enough scenario where I would rather whack than
[13410.34s -> 13418.25s]  use this. All right, I gotta... let me get... let me beat the boss here. Let me at least get to the
[13418.25s -> 13427.10s]  end of this damn game. Or at least this area. All right. Three moves. I need some pee here.
[13431.75s -> 13469.11s]  What should I do? Setting it up. All right. Let's go. Look at how many wilds I'm gonna have.
[13476.09s -> 13489.26s]  Three wilds in a row. And I can move five times. Bones. All right, so we've got wild here. No,
[13489.26s -> 13502.41s]  I can move this down. No, hold on. Let me think about this. If I move this over, I could do
[13503.29s -> 13538.73s]  one, two, three. One, two, three, and then up. Right? Let's go. Oh, fucking hell yeah. Look at
[13538.73s -> 13549.96s]  this. I can just move and do it. I don't need the wilds. All right, I'm in a good position. This is
[13549.96s -> 13559.66s]  not a bad... now I can whack away. Can I kill you? Are you dead? Hold on. Yeah, let me kill you first
[13560.46s -> 13568.71s]  because you're the threat. And then that means I got one thing left to... I don't have any more
[13568.71s -> 13588.81s]  moves, but can I just end it right here? Yeah. All right, I'm gonna end it next turn. Did I get
[13588.81s -> 13597.70s]  further? This is as far as I've ever forgotten. Uh-oh. So I'm assuming the... that means I cannot
[13597.70s -> 13603.69s]  attack them, right? Yeah, I made it to the boss. Oh yeah, I did make it to the boss. You're right.
[13603.69s -> 13609.74s]  Okay. So I cannot... I have to hurt these guys with spells. It's gonna be a pain in the ass.
[13611.78s -> 13618.33s]  Does the big summoning bone... seven bone move count as a spell? Or do I have to kill them
[13618.33s -> 13629.75s]  with the whack? I wonder. No, it doesn't. Okay. Well, maybe I should just try to freeze everybody
[13629.75s -> 13640.04s]  right off the bat. So I could go like this. Set up a... yeah, let's set it up. So then I can bring
[13640.04s -> 13644.36s]  this down. One, two, three. No, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't hold on a second. Don't mess this up.
[13645.48s -> 13653.67s]  I want to get a big wave of goo. Because I want to freeze everybody. So if I bring this down,
[13653.67s -> 13672.39s]  that's three. Up, up. I need to... I hope I'm doing this right. Shit. Oh god. Oh god, oh god, oh god,
[13672.39s -> 13680.38s]  oh god, oh god, oh god. I might have to cancel this plan. It's possible. I gotta... it's possible next
[13680.38s -> 13692.95s]  turn. I only have one fucking move though. What? One move? No! That sucks. I can do it all next
[13692.95s -> 13706.60s]  turn and then... no, I can't. Can I? I'm in trouble. It's okay. It's only one heart. Oh no! What?
[13709.16s -> 13721.10s]  What was that? I'm dead. I ha... this is my only opportunity. I just... everyone has to be frozen
[13721.10s -> 13741.40s]  and then hopefully I can make something happen. I hope this works. Oh no. I'm so disappointed. That...
[13741.40s -> 13748.12s]  that's so... that's so hard. I'm almost dead. Ah, I shouldn't have even tried to build the big one,
[13748.12s -> 13763.32s]  but as a play... eee. It's okay. I'm gonna try to get bones. This is not gonna touch any bones, right?
[13763.96s -> 13795.29s]  No? Okay. Holy shit. Are you kidding me? This is it. Game over. Yeah, it's game over. It is, right?
[13796.39s -> 13804.84s]  Is there any scenario where I can live? Maybe. If I bring this down here,
[13805.64s -> 13818.39s]  poop up the right side, get a bone, kill the rights... uh, I think it's over. Do poop for the
[13818.39s -> 13830.71s]  rerolls. Where do I put this though? On the right? Reroll a row of tiles, but which row?
[13831.59s -> 13841.90s]  I could do P, but that's not gonna be enough. What really ha... I got screwed here trying to
[13841.90s -> 13848.66s]  reroll this into the green one. That was the big mistake. Do the third row. One, two, three,
[13848.66s -> 13859.21s]  try to reroll this whole thing. Bone and then whack. Yeah, but I still... I'm gonna... I take it...
[13859.21s -> 13872.81s]  I take damage. There's no way I don't take damage. Try to roll for a poop. Reroll all the rows.
[13875.37s -> 13881.82s]  That's just like throwing dice in the air. I don't think that's gonna happen.
[13883.26s -> 13894.31s]  If only I had another move, I might be okay. Whatever. Let me see. Hold on. Cancel this.
[13895.35s -> 13905.69s]  Here's the only... here's the play that I see. The play that I see is try to... can I... is there a...
[13905.69s -> 13927.32s]  no, there's no way I can do it. Fuck. I'm so sad. I'm so sad right now. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait,
[13927.32s -> 13934.82s]  wait, wait. Wait a second. Hold on. Hold on. Everybody wait. Don't move. I can heal, but I
[13934.82s -> 13950.95s]  need to... can I gain... oh wait. Hold on. I can heal a full heart. If I use this six times, I can
[13950.95s -> 13962.98s]  heal a full heart. Because this is only a half heart. Wild to heal, but then... yeah, but then
[13962.98s -> 13966.98s]  it's only half a heart. I die. I'm gonna hit three times. Wait, maybe not. Let me try it. Let's see.
[13966.98s -> 13980.14s]  Let's go for it. Fuck it. Here we go. Now rip. No, I didn't even know I had this up there. It
[13980.14s -> 13984.38s]  don't matter. Fuck it. It's fine. Everything's fine. We're gonna be fine. I'm gonna do this.
[13984.38s -> 13991.06s]  It don't matter. Whatever. It's okay. Well, I'm up against the goddamn wall anyways with like a
[13991.06s -> 14006.06s]  toothpick versus a wild bear. I'm up against the wall. Let's try to booger him. Wait. Not yet.
[14006.06s -> 14037.14s]  Bring this down. Oh, fuck you. I actually might not die. God damn it. If only I had done that
[14037.14s -> 14052.47s]  first. How am I supposed to know? They move twice in one turn. Yeah, I'm dead. Well, that was fun.
[14052.47s -> 14059.30s]  Well, that's fun while it lasted. Yeah, five hearts before. Yeah, but even still, these guys
[14059.30s -> 14067.06s]  move twice. They would have done like five hearts worth of damage. The real killer of this one was
[14067.06s -> 14073.38s]  rolling this and rolling it. Not only rolling it once, but rolling it twice and it was bones twice.
[14074.26s -> 14098.50s]  That sucked. Hold on. I'm not giving up yet. Hold on. Wait, I can do that next turn. Wait. I'm not
[14098.50s -> 14136.65s]  giving up yet. Oh, hold on. One, two, three. I guess I can do one. I can do a super bone,
[14136.65s -> 14144.68s]  but that doesn't matter. Does a bone dream exist a little bit, but not really? Wait, maybe it does
[14144.68s -> 14157.48s]  because then I can club. Club. I'm still dead. Move bottom row. One, two, three. Okay. If I go
[14157.48s -> 14168.02s]  like this, then that's one, two, three. One, two, three. I got two wilds. No, do seven teeth instead
[14169.67s -> 14186.14s]  and then heal. Hold on. I can't get seven teeth this round. Can I? No, I can't get seven. Can I
[14186.14s -> 14197.43s]  get enough to heal once? I get the two wilds. So if I go like this over, so then that's wild, wild.
[14197.43s -> 14203.61s]  I need to squish my eyes for a second. I have seven bones, but that's not going to help me.
[14203.61s -> 14210.86s]  I don't want to die. Bottom left row. Yeah, but the seven bones don't hurt these guys.
[14213.06s -> 14221.88s]  The seven teeth allows me to get a full heart. If I do seven bones, I could swing twice, right?
[14222.84s -> 14230.92s]  I got three wilds. Yeah. Bones let me whack, but bones don't heal me. And if one thing touches me,
[14230.92s -> 14241.67s]  I'm dead. Can I do seven twice? I need a defensive combo. Yeah, I need the seven teeth. I've got to
[14241.67s -> 14247.03s]  do a defensive combo. I've got to, I've got to do, I've got to bring the hammer down, heal a full heart.
[14248.68s -> 14257.03s]  All right, let's go. I'm fucking excited. Here we go. Ready? We got one, two, three,
[14258.30s -> 14265.75s]  one, two, three. Bring this one down. Wild in the middle. Wait, don't even have to do this. Wild.
[14266.86s -> 14277.19s]  No, don't do that. I don't want to use the moves though, because if I use my moves, then I,
[14283.05s -> 14291.10s]  I'm saying wild in the middle here and then over and then down. No, it's like,
[14292.95s -> 14299.88s]  wilds are better than the moves. I could do wild here, wild here, and then drag this one in.
[14300.76s -> 14311.77s]  I think that's what I'm doing. That's what I'm doing. Wild, wild. Bring this down. If I drop
[14311.77s -> 14316.57s]  this one down, then I could, but it's the same thing happens. So I could do there and then wild
[14316.57s -> 14326.38s]  in the left, wild in the middle. That'll do it. That's one less move. Yeah, that's true. Okay.
[14327.02s -> 14344.49s]  Wait a minute. Okay. Give me, give me the heal. God. Okay. You all thought I was done. Not even
[14344.49s -> 14358.87s]  close. You all thought I was dead. But hold on. Wait a second. I still have to worry about this.
[14361.46s -> 14371.83s]  Now I do a poo combo in the middle. Poo combo in the middle, then heal.
[14374.15s -> 14382.90s]  Yes. Drag down. Wild in the middle. Heal. Bone kill left. I can't kill the one in the left.
[14383.54s -> 14404.62s]  That's what I'm doing. If it's wrong, then by God, I don't want to be right. I have another move.
[14404.62s -> 14422.78s]  What's the move here? Reroll the, which one though? Top row? Third row. Right here. Top row,
[14422.78s -> 14431.32s]  but I lose the heart. Do I really want to lose these hearts to kill the curse? All right. Okay.
[14431.32s -> 14438.70s]  I got the heart back. Fuck. Okay. Fuck. I can do, I can sticky. I can do, I can do a sticky.
[14443.03s -> 14454.84s]  Sticky on which one is the question. This is tough now. Sticky the one on the left.
[14457.61s -> 14463.34s]  Right. What do you got now? What am I destroying? What do I need to do? I got a seven bone scenario
[14463.34s -> 14468.62s]  coming up, but it don't matter. But it does matter. Seven bone scenario is increasing odds
[14468.62s -> 14474.15s]  here, but I don't want to do that. I want to whack, which reroll something else. Hop out,
[14474.15s -> 14498.20s]  reroll the top row. The second row. Oh, reroll second row. Destroy two, three. What a good idea
[14498.20s -> 14511.85s]  that was from that person that said that. Now what? I can't do seven bones. It's not possible.
[14513.32s -> 14522.42s]  I can't do eight bones. I can do bones twice. Okay. Now destroy two, three. No, no, no, no,
[14522.42s -> 14530.63s]  no, no, no. That's not a good idea. Destroy the teeth. Talk about like up here. I fucked it up.
[14531.27s -> 14535.34s]  How did I fuck it up? What are you talking about? Destroy this one here is what I'm thinking.
[14536.06s -> 14550.17s]  I've got nine bones. Destroy one bone. I don't know what to do. I don't know.
[14550.33s -> 14560.54s]  This poop gets rid of this bone. All right. This poop gets rid of this bone. No, this one
[14560.54s -> 14567.03s]  gets rid of this bone. It doesn't get rid of this one, right? Break the first bone on the left.
[14567.75s -> 14573.43s]  I don't think that is that a good idea? This one, he won't break this one. Why? Middle tooth
[14573.43s -> 14585.59s]  gives you four bones. Do not. You guys, I'm trying. There's a lot of knowledge in this chat
[14586.55s -> 14600.66s]  lying around. Three, one, get this one here. Sure. But okay, then I would bring,
[14601.96s -> 14610.42s]  I guess that's correct. Is that correct? Why did you make me do that? Oh, thank God. You're smart.
[14613.11s -> 14618.23s]  And then I'm going to get a double. Oh, baby. Here it comes. Next turn. I am going, no, not
[14618.23s -> 14623.11s]  reroll the top row. Don't you freaking me out. I'm going to go up here, get this extra turn and the
[14623.11s -> 14629.19s]  bones. Good. I'm just going to go. We're done. I'm not going to reroll the second row because then
[14629.19s -> 14653.69s]  I don't want to lose this. But wait, hold on. I only have two turns. Think about the order.
[14654.33s -> 14659.43s]  Other one first. This is going to complete that. It'll, what do you mean other one first?
[14660.15s -> 14680.18s]  Yeah, this, that's what I'm doing. But I know left first. I'm not doing right first.
[14680.82s -> 14683.78s]  I'm doing the seven. I'm not going to do the right one first. That'll make four.
[14684.58s -> 14708.74s]  Okay. I got two swings. Oh no. What do I do? Kill the one. This is three damage. I can kill one of
[14708.74s -> 14721.13s]  them. I'm going to kill the one on the right first. Oh my fucking God. I just got a crit.
[14721.77s -> 14731.93s]  Give me two crits. Give me two crits and we'll go. We're good. My God. I can't believe it. Did
[14731.93s -> 14752.01s]  we just do it? I think we actually just did it. Don't fuck it up. Did I do it wrong? Wild. Two
[14752.01s -> 14761.53s]  wilds. Okay. We're going to do bone. I win. I win. It's over. I win. No, no, no. Wait, wait,
[14761.53s -> 14775.66s]  wait, wait, wait. Okay. No, we're fine. Everything's good. Everything's fine. No, everything's okay.
[14781.78s -> 14794.73s]  Kill, kill them before I do anything. Now I can do, I can heal. Let's heal. Two wilds.
[14795.29s -> 14804.10s]  Bang, bang. That lets me heal. I think that's the fucking idea here. Wait, wild the hearts.
[14804.90s -> 14810.22s]  Only one wild necessary for the hearts. You're talking about, talking about, talking about.
[14810.22s -> 14819.14s]  What are you talking about here? Talking about going like this. What do you mean? Teeth heal.
[14819.14s -> 14826.18s]  What? Get hearts. There's a whole cafeteria of people screaming different scenarios at me
[14827.06s -> 14833.14s]  and I have my own scenarios, but we have to, you guys are doing a great job helping me. I love it.
[14833.14s -> 14843.02s]  I only have one wild, so not two wilds. So therefore we're going to do the teeth because
[14843.02s -> 14848.94s]  I can wild this, bring this up, which then that means I can use this. But it was, does that work?
[14854.33s -> 14871.00s]  Do poop because then I can just get mana. You mean play safe and make a poop poops. Three,
[14871.00s -> 14892.07s]  one poop, three, two wild. I got to, I got to like turn this music off. It's like stressful music.
[14892.07s -> 14901.11s]  It's hard for me to even think. Four, two wild, make a poop. Four, two wild. So you want me to
[14901.11s -> 14916.79s]  go right here with a wild and then drag this guy over and make a poop and drop it. And then
[14916.79s -> 14933.19s]  I'm rerolling. I don't even know the fuck I want to reroll. Make a tooth. Reroll number four. Tooth
[14933.19s -> 14977.40s]  and heal. Good play. Now reroll. Bottom row. Reason. Get ready for next row. In fact, delete
[14977.64s -> 14999.78s]  teeth for the bone. I need bones. You're right. I just like burped. Okay. I'm good. I got, I did it.
[14999.78s -> 15018.68s]  Game over. I win. I can't believe I have full health right now. Holy shit. I can't believe,
[15018.68s -> 15026.68s]  I can't believe, I'm going to say I did that, but it was like 21, 22% me, like 81% you.
[15027.72s -> 15032.04s]  Like it's 78%. You gain a soul heart. That's pretty good. Reroll next row of tiles.
[15033.24s -> 15052.47s]  I didn't even do anything. Pog jam. Yeah. I want the soul heart. I don't, I don't want this. This is
[15052.47s -> 15066.65s]  it. Bumbo versus Gizarda. She's, I got full health. Cannot do spells by the way. Very important to
[15066.65s -> 15087.18s]  know. Can only beat this with attacks. So I can do, we can do a big goop here. Get a seven bone
[15087.18s -> 15094.78s]  lined up. All right. Let me first, let's go up and then let's just goop. I'm not, I don't,
[15094.78s -> 15101.14s]  you know, what a fucking don't, don't even need seven boogers. It doesn't, it does the same damn
[15101.14s -> 15112.04s]  thing. It's two always. All right. Now we need bones. Let's start destroying shit for bones.
[15120.46s -> 15161.98s]  Looking pretty good. Now. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Big crits. All right. Let's not get cocky
[15161.98s -> 15201.40s]  here. Uh, I'm going to say just tooth it up. What the fuck does this mean? Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah. Oh,
[15201.40s -> 15229.43s]  man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Okay. Game over. I went whack. What? Oh shit. No, it's okay.
[15229.83s -> 15244.25s]  Oh no. I got two whacks. He thought he had me. Bang. I got a little too cocky. I didn't realize
[15244.25s -> 15268.70s]  it spun around in one hell of a thing. Weird box in back of room. What in there? Another
[15268.70s -> 15309.90s]  Bumble. Bumble the weird has been unlocked. Did I beat it? Three levels? I didn't see another
[15309.90s -> 15317.26s]  unlock. Maybe I have to beat the game like 10 times or something. All right. Let's see Bumble
[15317.26s -> 15329.62s]  the weird. When they kill, they gain movement. Magic marker adds more of a selected tile. That's
[15329.62s -> 15337.83s]  awesome. Removes tiles and throws them. Puzzle flick. You have to beat the game with Bumble
[15337.83s -> 15356.44s]  the weird. Beat the game with Bumble the weird. Let's go for it. Yeah, let's do it. I like it.
[15356.44s -> 15366.92s]  Wouldn't you guys help me do this game? It's fun. Options menu. Where did I see this options menu?
[15366.92s -> 15381.59s]  I swear. Is it the main menu? Can I get back to the main menu from here? It's before character
[15381.59s -> 15399.19s]  select though. I guess I can just quit, right? There was a bad bug in the sound setting, so they
[15399.19s -> 15417.18s]  had to take it up before release. This is going to be hard. Let's new game. Okay. Options. There
[15417.18s -> 15446.07s]  you go. All right. Epic chill step collection. Whoops. Reset progress. Animal crossing. Yeah,
[15446.07s -> 15457.56s]  I hate this. Animal crossing. We always go back to animal crossing though, don't we?
[15458.36s -> 15478.68s]  It's always animal crossing. Every time. No, not Katamari. Put on sea shanties.
[15481.06s -> 15491.19s]  Super Mario Brothers Super Show intro in every language. Put on Sims music. How about roller
[15491.19s -> 15537.91s]  coaster tycoon 2 building music? Or was it zoom out music? There we go. All right. What we got?
[15537.91s -> 15548.79s]  Removes tiles and throws them. I wonder how much damage that does. I didn't mean to do that. That
[15548.79s -> 15564.84s]  was my bad. Already fucked it up. Might as well reset and reset all progress. Reset all progress.
[15567.22s -> 15590.82s]  This is really loud for me. Why? All right, let's go. Bumble the weird. Let's unlock the
[15590.82s -> 15609.91s]  final game's mystery. Puzzle. Fuck. Puzzle. Fuck. Puzzle. I'm too old for that. Square. Okay. This
[15609.91s -> 15619.16s]  time we're just going tooth or poop. Right there. Right down the middle. That's a good idea. And
[15619.16s -> 15624.62s]  then we're going to go. I think we're going to move this up and prepare for a big one.
[15624.62s -> 15655.66s]  What do you think? Sounds pretty good idea. Thanks, man. This is three damage, but what?
[15660.55s -> 15666.28s]  Could just take out the middle. Why am I not? So they don't attack me and kill me.
[15666.28s -> 15671.32s]  Adds more of a selected tile. Oh, what's that? We're going to pick bone. Hey, look at that.
[15672.28s -> 15711.06s]  Ooh. Don't fuck it up. Um, that looks kind of good to me. What do I care though? Wait.
[15712.79s -> 15716.55s]  I screwed it up. This music is chilling me out too much.
[15717.27s -> 15744.25s]  Removes tiles and throws them. Wait, I'm getting moves. Every time I throw something, do I move?
[15745.51s -> 15756.82s]  Which tile do I want to throw? The poo? Oh my God. How many times do I get to do this?
[15758.71s -> 15775.64s]  Move on kill. Right. Holy shit. This is an awesome character. Oh my God. Move on kill one.
[15778.30s -> 15797.10s]  This character is ridiculous. How do you lose with this character?
[15798.06s -> 15809.35s]  That's so powerful. Oh, music's gone. Sorry. Uh, how about
[15810.46s -> 15813.02s]  Metroid? Relaxing and ambient music from Metroid.
[15813.66s -> 15821.22s]  Blocks the next two attacks. Move a tile row one to the right or blocks the next two attacks.
[15821.94s -> 15831.88s]  The buzz looks pretty crazy. Booger sink. That's a good idea.
[15832.68s -> 15849.00s]  Okay. We just need to kill one. So I'm thinking tooth. No, hold on. Yeah, let's get tooth.
[15849.72s -> 15857.96s]  This should lead us into a...
[15861.98s -> 15870.90s]  adds more of a selected tile. We're going to go with, uh, we're going to go with, uh, bones. Okay.
[15873.56s -> 15882.33s]  Keep up the killing spree. And we got to do it again. Removes a tile. So let's get rid of this one
[15883.37s -> 15889.48s]  and throw it this way. What are you going to do, huh?
[15894.46s -> 15900.73s]  What a room full of shitty enemies. I don't want to get too cocky.
[15901.29s -> 15925.16s]  That's pretty much it. I can do... no, I can do this. Play Half-Life music in honor of Half-Life VR.
[15927.43s -> 15957.69s]  I could, but will I? No. Just add more hearts. Yeah, I mean, this is kind of doing well for me now.
[15967.42s -> 15977.13s]  Turn one kill. I feel like, um, Bumbo the Weird might little, little bit of extra tuning.
[15979.34s -> 15987.40s]  Seems, uh, very, very, very, very good. So what's with these rooms? Is this
[15988.92s -> 16013.13s]  designed around just a bunch of random enemies in a room? Okay, let me go. Okay, I'm ready for
[16013.13s -> 16024.28s]  another one. Um, I kind of want to do... let's throw out... what do I want to throw out? This one here.
[16025.08s -> 16041.70s]  Yep, check it. And then that allows me to... like this. First turn. You never get a chance.
[16044.09s -> 16049.46s]  You're not going to get a single chance. Although, wait a minute. Maybe you do get a chance.
[16051.59s -> 16062.44s]  Do I have a four? I could do that. Move a tile to the right. It's... hold on. This is possible for me
[16062.44s -> 16069.62s]  to do this. Because now I can just move to the right. Uh, how many times am I going to do this?
[16069.62s -> 16074.57s]  Four times. So move a tile to the right. We're gonna do...
[16087.46s -> 16118.47s]  Let's get some bones. Um, now we're gonna remove the... this one and kill you. I think that's...
[16118.47s -> 16131.70s]  no, I'm not done. What happened? What do you mean miss? I... it's because I clicked in the wrong
[16131.78s -> 16149.98s]  section or something. What the fuck was that? I'm just kind of dumb. Whatever. Uh,
[16151.10s -> 16157.02s]  I've ruined it. Yeah, I guess if you miss click in the wrong row, you just throws it down the...
[16157.66s -> 16173.85s]  I guess. Okay, whatever. Oh, let's go this way. Yeah, that's... whatever. You can... that'll care.
[16178.95s -> 16192.06s]  One, two, three. Middle is empty. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Charges random usable item.
[16194.41s -> 16214.14s]  Copies spell at random. These both suck. Bumbo versus peeper. All right, let's just pick a tile
[16214.14s -> 16234.10s]  to throw. Well, you made that easy for me. Now let's go like this. This is gonna be beautiful.
[16237.37s -> 16260.65s]  Add more to select the tile. We're gonna go with wilds. Bug. Removes the tile. We're gonna remove...
[16260.65s -> 16278.60s]  What should we remove? Uh, probably this here. Go again. And now we can do the sticky. We can do
[16278.60s -> 16297.69s]  actually a big sticky. You ain't going anywhere. Move a tile one row to the right. Well,
[16298.73s -> 16311.98s]  if you ask, I'll do it. Eyes? What about the eyes? They're not even gonna get a chance.
[16312.62s -> 16319.22s]  This dude's dead. I can move to the right and I would get... uh, no, should I do? What should
[16319.22s -> 16327.29s]  I do? Move what to the right? I can do it four times. One, two, three, four. Is that gonna help?
[16327.93s -> 16342.62s]  What should I move? The teeth. Row... the second row? Third and fourth rows? Oh, would you look at
[16342.62s -> 16366.57s]  that? We're just gonna keep going. I'm gonna remove this booger. Dead. That was turn one.
[16371.54s -> 16380.70s]  Items are on sale. 50% off. That's like automatic. That's an automatic click.
[16383.11s -> 16392.94s]  All right. What do we got? Spell cost? Spell hurts more. This has a question mark around it, but
[16392.94s -> 16405.72s]  can I actually increase this? Or is this a waste? It doesn't... it doesn't work. It's broken. Don't.
[16405.72s -> 16415.91s]  It's not worth it. No. It's a scam. Okay. Um, reroll spell. I could reroll this. Try to get
[16415.91s -> 16432.38s]  something better because this thing sucks. Um, that's insane. Plus one movement. I could, uh,
[16435.34s -> 16442.52s]  should I reroll its cost from poop? No, I need a poop sink, don't I? No, I need a poop sink. Spell
[16442.52s -> 16451.05s]  hurts more. That's fine. We'll keep that the way it is. Let's roll it. What do the puzzle pieces
[16451.05s -> 16461.96s]  mean? More spell damage? That's really good too. All right. Give me a hand on this one.
[16463.38s -> 16472.34s]  More yellow tiles. I need this one. This one's, that's huge. This is like, I'm guaranteed to win
[16472.34s -> 16480.34s]  if I get it. If I get this, this is, there's no way I lose again. Left? This is too important. I need
[16480.34s -> 16487.75s]  to pull. Yeah, it's way too important. I'm sorry. Because this is a guaranteed absolute 100%. There's
[16487.75s -> 16510.54s]  no way I lose. Okay. Give me a hint. It's random? I know, but I don't want it to be my fault.
[16511.26s -> 16527.53s]  Most people are saying left or middle. I would probably have said,
[16528.09s -> 16538.90s]  I'm not going to tell you because I don't want it to be my fault. All right. Number one is left.
[16538.90s -> 16543.22s]  Uh, but I'm going to go with right because it's the least. God damn it. Which one was it?
[16554.74s -> 16556.10s]  Now it is my fault.
[16562.36s -> 16569.11s]  Should I reroll the spells cost on one of these? What if I reroll this and it's like a two?
[16570.84s -> 16592.90s]  Oh, whatever. Koala brain. Yeah, I know. Yeah. I figured that would have been such like a pog
[16592.90s -> 16598.38s]  moment. No, for me. Sorry. We don't need it. We don't need it. We don't need it. We're just
[16598.38s -> 16603.99s]  going to kill the thing. How many, what do I got? I got three moves. Let's get a bone in here.
[16604.79s -> 16613.22s]  Toss it right up the left side. And then we're going to do, got another move left here. We're
[16613.22s -> 16618.79s]  going to do, uh, let's see. I wonder what I want to do with this one. I think we're going to probably
[16618.79s -> 16629.75s]  do, uh, anybody see anything? Anybody see anything? I could line up a pretty good, uh,
[16639.03s -> 16660.54s]  set up for a yellow, um, I could do teeth and set up teeth. Uh, okay. This thing's going to
[16660.54s -> 16668.22s]  explode on me. Okay. I need teeth and I can remove. I know here we go. I'm going to go like this,
[16668.22s -> 16680.63s]  which will be, no, no. What are you an imbecile? Are you dumb? Poop is movement. Yeah. Yep. Fuck.
[16680.63s -> 16732.49s]  Yep. Oh, hold on. That's actually not that good. Okay. I'm going to slow down here.
[16733.69s -> 16744.65s]  I have a shit load of teeth. Three, three. I could do seven teeth and I can kill the fly.
[16744.65s -> 16755.58s]  It fucking hurts. Okay. Then I'm going to, I gotta kill this other fly. It's screwing me up.
[16756.78s -> 16759.98s]  Get rid of this, uh, bone. No, which, how do I make this better?
[16762.20s -> 16768.26s]  Get rid of this bone, right? Give her to the booger right here. Booger, booger, booger, booger,
[16768.26s -> 16774.23s]  booger, booger, booger, booger, booger, booger, booger. Give her to this P. Give her to this booger.
[16774.23s -> 16776.63s]  Give her to the P at the top. Give her to the booger. Give her to the P.
[16777.51s -> 16792.58s]  Get her ready to do the poop first. Okay. All right. Okay. Then we can do, we can do the
[16792.58s -> 16821.83s]  one movement. Booger. Remove this tile. Bingo. Oh, what's that? Now, oh, I can move. Let's move
[16822.39s -> 16829.19s]  the tiles now. Don't waste any moves. Why don't I just go like this and then go like this again.
[16829.19s -> 16838.98s]  Get the bone, get my extra turn. Now I can remove this tile here, this tooth,
[16839.70s -> 16846.79s]  because who gives a shit? Bingo. Throw it. We're dead. No, you're not. I fucking hate this game.
[16847.35s -> 16878.01s]  I hate it. Okay. I messed up. He's so moody. I need teeth. I'm out of hearts though. This is
[16878.01s -> 16899.77s]  actually not good. Let's go. I'm an idiot. Oh, right. I don't lose it between turns.
[16900.41s -> 16922.28s]  I forgot. Different character. Explode. Make the hearts. Oh yeah. Fuck. I'm too busy.
[16923.72s -> 16930.12s]  Splash back attack. Attacking enemies. Attacking enemies take damage or splash back. I can't even
[16930.12s -> 16948.07s]  heal anyways. I think the splash back is the one. This is a lot of enemies. This is a lot. Okay. I
[16948.07s -> 16958.92s]  can't really fuck around now. I only have one heart. I could set up a huge poop. This is what
[16958.92s -> 16976.63s]  I'm going to do. And then we're going to do a teeth setup. So let's see, what's the best way to do this?
[16977.43s -> 16996.78s]  There's like a bunch of ways I could probably do this. You go this way. Go one, two, fuck no.
[16997.50s -> 17014.36s]  Do seven bones instead. I actually, I need the seven. I need to do the stomp. If I get one,
[17014.36s -> 17035.94s]  two, three, one, two, three, four, five, six, move this one down. Bone at the top. Um,
[17037.34s -> 17050.54s]  bones are good too. Yeah, I know, but I have a lot of teeth. And then if I go like this,
[17052.01s -> 17069.35s]  move you up. Wait. Okay. Yeah. I do with the poop shields. It's right. This should do it now.
[17069.99s -> 17087.58s]  All right. So we got seven here. Okay. They're all dead. Good. Cool. Okay. Bones.
[17092.33s -> 17101.03s]  Let's go right down the middle. I'm doing it again because you can only take damage from this shit.
[17101.67s -> 17117.22s]  Right. Let's get a poop on the left side. Yeah. And that allows me to add a movement and I can
[17117.22s -> 17130.63s]  make more tiles and you know what we're doing. I mean, obviously teeth. So I could go one, two,
[17130.63s -> 17137.27s]  grab it. I could do a big one here. Three. Oh yeah. Okay. Here we go. Let's set it up. It's
[17137.27s -> 17157.91s]  not going to kill that, but it'll kill these things. Okay. Bring it down. It did kill. Wait,
[17157.91s -> 17162.47s]  why did it kill that? Why did it kill the one that has, Oh, cause that's not magic.
[17163.19s -> 17174.31s]  Reduce the cost of your spells or flips a row of tiles. This one. That means I can just do the
[17174.31s -> 17185.14s]  more often. All right. Second boss Bumble versus Gibbs. This thing was kind of shitty, but I don't
[17185.14s -> 17191.45s]  want to get cocky. I'm trying to use this. No, not yet. All right. Oh, what do I want to do? Big,
[17191.45s -> 17209.69s]  big moves, big moves, big moves. Oh, that's extra more tiles bones. All right. Bingo. Good game.
[17221.90s -> 17229.70s]  Hey, what do you know? Splash back attack. That was came in pretty useful. I guess
[17235.72s -> 17253.98s]  may gain movement or enemies may take damage moving. Probably the battery, right? Okay. 21.
[17253.98s -> 17264.74s]  What do we got? The spell costs less. Which one remove tile and throw or add more of a selected
[17264.74s -> 17274.33s]  tile? Probably this one, the movement one with the piss. This is very difficult. This one are you,
[17274.33s -> 17280.57s]  but I can only do this once. I think it's this one. That'll be two, man. The marker.
[17284.14s -> 17291.85s]  Imagine how many times I'd be able to use this probably twice in one turn.
[17293.77s -> 17303.56s]  It'd be two and three. It'd be two and three. Okay. We're going to go marker. Spell hurts more.
[17304.20s -> 17327.88s]  Not worth it. Re-roll the spell. Splash back, but I'm going to use bones for this. It's too expensive.
[17328.52s -> 17339.96s]  Well, I'm going to get one of them. Spell hurt more on one. I thought that was, I thought I
[17339.96s -> 17360.70s]  couldn't do that. All right. Puzzle damage up. Oh, fuck. Are we certain that this doesn't work?
[17361.34s -> 17366.14s]  That's really good. I just, I'm just going to do it to splash back then.
[17367.18s -> 17379.51s]  Why would I not going to re-roll the spell? What just happened? How many times has that happened?
[17383.19s -> 17386.87s]  Okay. That's the third time in a row that I've re-rolled something into the same number that
[17386.87s -> 17399.45s]  it was already. Damn it. How is that even possible? One coin. Let's go. See if I can beat this.
[17401.13s -> 17405.05s]  You increase the damage, not re-rolled. Oh, but why does it still say two?
[17405.93s -> 17414.18s]  That's because I re-rolled the damage to two. Damage went from two to two.
[17415.35s -> 17422.47s]  All right. This is important. This is the one I got to win. We need better music than this.
[17422.47s -> 17428.28s]  Something a little more upbeat, but not too upbeat that I'm going to get nervous.
[17434.79s -> 17446.97s]  Insane aquarium OST. No, that'll drive people crazy. WWE entrance music. I like it. Okay. WWF
[17446.97s -> 17460.04s]  entrance music. These are, well, no, these are all the VODs. Yeah, this is bad. I can't do that.
[17463.42s -> 17468.46s]  Goodbye VOD viewers. I can't do that. Binding of Isaac OST.
[17470.62s -> 17486.52s]  Kata Mario. We just did that two days in a row. Not Banjo Kazooie. Metal Slug? Now that's one.
[17486.52s -> 17505.00s]  Metal Slug OST. Good choice. All right. Move one. We're going to throw. We're going to do,
[17506.52s -> 17510.20s]  I say we're going to go up with the, I don't know. I have no idea. Can you play for me?
[17515.50s -> 17526.86s]  What? Wait, what? Was this me going like what? Turn on the clicks? No, no, no, no.
[17527.42s -> 17531.64s]  Here we go. Watch this. This is, might be a, this might be a poor decision, but I'm going for it.
[17531.64s -> 17538.10s]  I don't care. Don't fuck it up. I want the more tiles because we're going to do
[17539.30s -> 17553.75s]  teeth. Set us up. It's set up and I get to drop poop right here. Oh, what's that? Look at me.
[17554.47s -> 17577.29s]  That's fine. All right. Now bone. Uh, yeah. Bone into, or should I slow?
[17578.09s -> 17583.37s]  Maybe I'll drop a poo over here just to be safe. I've looked at how many moves I have. Holy fuck.
[17593.93s -> 17598.81s]  Uh, I can't, I have to kill you with the spell. So let me get some bones and some teeth. I just
[17598.81s -> 17613.43s]  need bones and that's, I mean, I can't even hurt you. So let's throw a puzzle at you. Let's get
[17613.43s -> 17627.35s]  rid of, uh, over here. There you go. Now I kind of just have to wait until you open. Uh, should I
[17627.35s -> 17638.09s]  just, oh, how am I supposed to do? Okay. Add more, um, bones or teeth. Okay. Now just set up seven,
[17638.09s -> 17651.62s]  just set up seven of them. I can take as long as I want. Set up seven hearts. I can't do that.
[17654.79s -> 17660.36s]  Do hearts instead. I'm actually wondering if we should just farm hearts right now.
[17660.84s -> 17679.93s]  All right. Well, I can't, I'm, no, I can't. He's dead. Use the marker, but I, I, next time.
[17680.65s -> 17702.46s]  Poopy morph attack or gain gray mana. This is, wait, this is not even original metal slug.
[17702.46s -> 17710.68s]  Where's metal, where's original metal slug? Oh, this is like a compilation. All right. Look,
[17710.68s -> 17717.85s]  this is original metal slug is right here. There we go. Okay. Here's original metal slug. Okay. Um,
[17718.73s -> 17734.36s]  I wonder which one of these is even worth doing. Poop, maybe the poopy morph attack and take it.
[17734.36s -> 17737.96s]  No, but what do I want to get rid of? I just upgraded this, didn't I? No, I didn't.
[17738.76s -> 17750.60s]  Get rid of splashback. I don't think I'm taking it. No, how should I not take anything?
[17751.40s -> 17758.39s]  Splashback might be good later. No, I'm not going to take it. How do I just get out of this?
[17759.35s -> 17773.93s]  I don't think I can leave. I can't cancel. I'll replace splashback. That's a little too much
[17773.93s -> 17784.58s]  because I'm going to be using it for tiles. What are these guys? I don't know what these guys do.
[17785.30s -> 17794.98s]  Okay. We're looking for, first of all, very important, get the P. What do I want more of?
[17795.62s -> 17805.85s]  They have a double move. All right. Let's do poo then. Right down the middle.
[17806.65s -> 17811.13s]  And then let's get, I want to add more bones.
[17816.02s -> 17839.86s]  Fuck. Didn't want to do that. Didn't want that to happen. Oh, fuck. Maybe I did. Ooh.
[17839.86s -> 17848.33s]  Play this whole row. Another move. This is four damage. All right. Keep clearing it.
[17849.29s -> 17855.32s]  I'm all right with this. Can I kill this guy without doing anything? Let's see if I can kill
[17855.32s -> 17872.22s]  him. Okay. Let's add more teeth. That should be enough to at least move a little bit.
[17872.94s -> 17885.40s]  Get rid of the boogers. Beat him with a zero. Remove boogers now. All right.
[17885.96s -> 17904.98s]  Okay. This is a lot. I need to slow down. I have way too many teeth. Three. If I move,
[17906.42s -> 17912.38s]  I'm just going to keep this rolling. All right. Now I'm going to get hearts.
[17913.99s -> 17939.80s]  Do poopy mouth. Not yet. I'm just going to keep killing shit. Okay. Hearts. Now let's do tile
[17939.80s -> 17948.07s]  remove on this one on the bone. No, let's do this one. Just whip it right down the middle
[17949.11s -> 17961.08s]  and then do it again. I'm going to do it to this. I don't have any idea what I'm doing right now.
[17961.08s -> 17971.93s]  How about the poop over here or the bone? Okay. I don't know. All right. One, two, three, four,
[17971.93s -> 17989.74s]  five, six, seven hearts. Seven of them. Don't screw it up. This needs to move. This needs to move.
[17994.95s -> 18011.50s]  Oh, hold on. I, I, this is wrong for me. How do I get this to be right? Uh, it's, it's almost,
[18011.50s -> 18020.14s]  it's close. Kind of. Just take your time. Okay. And then this is going to come over here.
[18022.98s -> 18040.87s]  I'm just going to take my time. Yeah. I only take my time. Now why do I have one move? Okay.
[18041.35s -> 18056.10s]  Now this is, I need three over here. So move you here and then it's close. So now I go up,
[18056.10s -> 18062.02s]  up, up, and then I can move that one to the left. One more on the bottom. What do you mean?
[18065.45s -> 18089.18s]  Move wild to the middle with the spell. I see you Sam. There we go. All of this just to get an
[18089.18s -> 18110.15s]  extra soul heart. I hope it was worth it. Here we go. Cool. Cool. All right. Now, uh, whatever. Just
[18110.87s -> 18130.68s]  got to hit it once. Another move. I just need to kill it. Just who cares? No, I want to try and
[18130.68s -> 18141.62s]  bring this up. Dead. All right. Now I have two hearts. I think I have one more room and then
[18141.62s -> 18150.25s]  that's the boss after this. I already have a good scenario here for a, I got already. Already.
[18150.89s -> 18163.16s]  Bring this one down. Bring this one down. Already. I can fucking care less. Whatever you guys do.
[18163.80s -> 18180.55s]  Good night. And hell yeah. All right. Don't blow it. Destroy a row of tiles or plus three movement
[18180.55s -> 18188.49s]  and a random mana. That's the one. Yeah. I, what do I replace it? I'm going to, yeah. The heart's gone.
[18189.13s -> 18199.67s]  Why is the heart gone? What happened to the heart? They exploded? No, it was the fly.
[18200.47s -> 18205.46s]  All right. We'll have a mega battery and I'm going to, we're going to just get rid of the pot.
[18205.46s -> 18213.38s]  Put the morph attack. That's it. All right. Bumbo versus pyre matching specific color tiles is the
[18213.38s -> 18227.00s]  key. All right. I need to match yellow battery right off the bat. I think I'm doing battery
[18227.00s -> 18236.82s]  both these right off the bat. Okay. I have a lot of time to think about this. So we need to do
[18236.82s -> 18254.87s]  yellow tiles. Do seven P. Is that possible right now? I could go here. This is going to
[18254.87s -> 18260.66s]  take a lot of movement here. No, I'm not going to go for it. We're just going to do one, two.
[18270.68s -> 18285.48s]  Now what? Now is he hurt? Add more of his, all right. Is this, is this teeth? Okay. Um, hold on.
[18285.48s -> 18296.87s]  Now he's hurt. Teeth. How many teeth do I have? Seven teeth. Let's go. I can do one, two, three,
[18296.87s -> 18314.76s]  one, two, three. No, hold on. Do this first. Okay. Okay. Crush him. Ooh, that one stings.
[18316.41s -> 18332.14s]  All right. Hold on. More of what? Poop? More boogers, more bones. Hold on because I need to
[18332.14s -> 18341.48s]  make sure I'm protected. If I get hit once or twice, I'm dead. Bones. Okay. All right. Let's do it.
[18344.38s -> 18347.26s]  Not a great position, but it's enough for me to at least, let's see,
[18350.26s -> 18369.74s]  if I go, I'm going to have to do one and then can I do seven? Can I? I have two moves. Okay. I could
[18369.74s -> 18381.54s]  do bang, bang. Is that enough? This down, down. This is it? No, it's not. Use the spell to move
[18381.54s -> 18404.97s]  it once. Down, down. That's it. Where is it?
[18421.69s -> 18423.21s]  That character is really powerful.
[18423.85s -> 18432.25s]  Trap door under Bumbo. What do you think? More bigger coin? More better trash?
[18432.25s -> 18437.37s]  Even more bigger coin? That reminds me of Azazel. Original Azazel.
[18447.24s -> 18464.33s]  And the basement has been unlocked. The trap door. Let me see. Did I unlock anybody else?
[18465.05s -> 18469.32s]  Bumble the brave. Bumble the nimble. Bumble the stout. Bumble the weird.
[18470.12s -> 18487.51s]  Beat the game with the weird. How come I don't get this character? Do I have to beat it with
[18487.51s -> 18500.90s]  the fourth floor? You didn't beat the basement with Bumble the weird. You just moved the goalpost
[18500.90s -> 18515.74s]  forward. Hurry up and speed run it. There's a door there now? Yeah. So did I just do the
[18515.74s -> 18521.98s]  equivalent of you beat mom like five times or whatever? And now the video game starts?
[18523.42s -> 18533.00s]  Yeah, that's fucking awesome. That's cool. Only 20 more times did you get the real ending.
[18533.80s -> 18546.95s]  Except it's not that much more content yet. I think it's fun. Does it have the staying power
[18546.95s -> 18561.48s]  or something like Binding of Isaac? Probably not, but it is a cool little game. He hates it? No,
[18561.48s -> 18567.91s]  I think it's great. I don't think I'm gonna do... I mean, I would probably play this.
[18568.87s -> 18590.06s]  It's early access? Are you sure? It's not early access. No, this is released. This is definitely
[18590.06s -> 18593.34s]  one of those games that you just kind of play when you're just chilling like we've done today.
[18593.90s -> 18600.47s]  I would play the fuck out of this on my iPad. Oh, I would too. I mean, that's coming. That's coming
[18600.47s -> 18609.67s]  soon. Soon as in who knows how long that'll take. I know it's supposed to be coming on the Switch
[18609.67s -> 18621.45s]  or something, but I think it was pretty good. Yeah, that's another thing. Another really important
[18621.45s -> 18630.30s]  thing to remember about this game. When Binding of Isaac released just 1.0, it didn't have the
[18630.94s -> 18641.99s]  thousand plus items that are in it now. I'm sure that over the years there'll probably be at least
[18641.99s -> 18649.54s]  a couple of major additions to it. It was on Newgrounds in 2008 with two floors. Yeah,
[18651.21s -> 18665.58s]  I think it's great. I think it's 13... it's like 14 bucks. I think it's worth your time, but this
[18665.58s -> 18670.38s]  isn't a free game on Newgrounds. No, I think it's worth it. I think it's worth like the 13, 14 dollars.
[18671.91s -> 18674.95s]  I mean, I've been playing this game for over five hours now and it's...
[18678.17s -> 18682.73s]  there's still more to do. It's still... it's a game that you're just supposed to play through
[18682.73s -> 18706.60s]  like 30, 40 times in a row. We'll see. But you didn't. Well, not yet. It's got bad Steam reviews.
[18708.25s -> 18712.97s]  It's kind of mixed, I guess. People are mad about the bugs that were there last week.
[18716.15s -> 18720.07s]  I mean, that's completely understandable. If the game crashes in the middle of your run,
[18720.07s -> 18731.00s]  that's kind of... that sucks. But once they patch it a bunch of times and it's the game that
[18731.00s -> 18733.96s]  kind of, I guess, should have released a week or a half ago or so, a week ago.
[18734.76s -> 18743.27s]  I would say if you want to wait till... I mean, it's 10% off right now.
[18744.81s -> 18751.93s]  If you like what you saw, then you liked what you saw. I think it's an interesting mechanic.
[18751.93s -> 18758.63s]  Did he get softlocked? Yeah, I got softlocked. I had to go back to the very first save file
[18758.63s -> 18766.84s]  in Dead Rising 2. Is this a sponsored stream? Why the hell would I do a sponsored Bumbo stream?
[18772.70s -> 18782.89s]  Hey, yeah. Bye, guys. My first ever sponsored stream. It's Bumbo. No, I think it was cute. It
[18782.89s -> 18788.33s]  was fun. It was interesting. It's taken a long time. But I mean, it's only like a handful of
[18788.33s -> 18793.88s]  people that are working on this. I thought it was good. I liked it. And I'm going to play it
[18793.88s -> 18804.09s]  another time. Not on stream. I'm going to play it on my own. But, guys... No, no, no, don't say it.
[18804.09s -> 18810.65s]  Don't say it. Don't say it. Guys, don't say it. Oh, no, no. It's only been five and a half hours.
[18810.65s -> 18825.72s]  Don't say it. Guys, I have to go. No, but why? Why do you have to go? What? No. Dude, come on.
[18825.72s -> 18840.76s]  I am going to go start working on the lazy fuck sultan. What is that? What the fuck? Oh,
[18840.76s -> 18851.93s]  come on. What does that even mean? Liar. All right, let me explain for those of you that
[18851.93s -> 18859.13s]  are not sure what I'm talking about here. In the probably the second week of December,
[18860.82s -> 18868.10s]  I'm going to have a series of streams where I have an enormous Minecraft server.
[18868.92s -> 18872.66s]  That's probably going to be the first one. And it's going to be...
[18873.46s -> 18881.58s]  Fuck the king. I am going to rule over a kingdom with hopefully potentially hundreds and hundreds
[18881.58s -> 18890.12s]  of slots on a server. It's going to be a kind of slightly RP kind of scenario where if I die,
[18891.74s -> 18900.49s]  it's over. The king's dead. I am going to collect taxes on you. I'm going to have bodyguards.
[18904.58s -> 18910.14s]  Good luck. There's going to be an aging system, hopefully, if we can get it coded,
[18912.23s -> 18918.23s]  where you if you so people can't just turtle, you know, like five hours in game or 10 hours
[18918.23s -> 18926.36s]  in actual game is like you die. You're dead. He thinks the guards will protect him. I think they
[18926.36s -> 18931.48s]  will. Oh, they will because they're going to be all trusted. Very, very highly trusted people.
[18931.48s -> 18938.07s]  I'm going to be surrounded by them. There will be grievances with the kingdom. I will usually be
[18938.07s -> 18949.02s]  expected to make statues of me. Oh, there'll be consequences. There's a lot going on that it's
[18949.02s -> 18953.78s]  going to be a hopefully it's going to be a lot of fun. And that's not it. There's going to be
[18954.90s -> 18961.46s]  there's an this is kind of a series of like the streamers of fucking egomaniac because as we go
[18961.46s -> 18969.22s]  forward with other games in that sort of open no goal RP style, I want to do this where I don't
[18969.22s -> 18974.82s]  do anything. I physically do not play the game and thousands of you just just play the game for
[18974.82s -> 18982.65s]  me. I want like 50 diamond blocks and you just bring them to me and I just sit there and we have
[18982.65s -> 18986.73s]  like cameras that are observers that are going around seeing how people are doing.
[18992.25s -> 18995.93s]  If I'm unhappy, like I'll just make I'll call a court and we'll decide what we're going to do.
[18996.57s -> 19002.73s]  You need to protect me. I'll have loyal I'll pay I'll pay in like in game money. We'll have like
[19002.73s -> 19006.49s]  try to have like an in game currency of like have like mercenaries to protect me and protect the
[19006.49s -> 19023.10s]  kingdom. But there's a lot that needs to go into it and I want to start working on it and get it
[19023.10s -> 19030.55s]  solid because I need to like buy servers. I need to hire some coders. I've been talking to
[19031.75s -> 19036.39s]  people like producers for this to try to help get cameras and observer cameras and
[19036.39s -> 19039.35s]  it's going to be a whole thing and it's probably going to be like a four or five week series.
[19040.07s -> 19043.35s]  We'll do it like once a week with probably potentially maybe one or two in Minecraft,
[19043.35s -> 19049.10s]  one or two in like Conan Exiles. We're just throwing them. We're just it's in the phase
[19049.10s -> 19054.28s]  right now we're trying to figure it out. But I definitely want to have a the lazy king sucks
[19054.84s -> 19070.26s]  stream at least probably four or five of them. But I will see you guys in a couple days. We will
[19070.26s -> 19075.14s]  start. I don't know what we're going to start because there's like this Star Wars which I was
[19075.14s -> 19081.94s]  like eh. There's like Outer Worlds where I'm like eh. There's PlayStation 1 where I'm like
[19081.94s -> 19095.42s]  eh. I'm trying there's a bunch of stuff I could pull from. 200 people are going to just bum rush
[19095.42s -> 19101.38s]  you. Well that's I'm going to do you guys don't think that I'm going to have plans? What am I
[19101.38s -> 19108.44s]  just yeah sure you're going to build a ladder and climb up to my tower into my window like I said
[19108.44s -> 19112.28s]  the other day with like an axe in your hand. You don't think I'm going to have sentries just people
[19112.28s -> 19119.29s]  ready? Oh did you pay that sentry in the in-game currency to like look the other way? Oh that's
[19119.29s -> 19123.96s]  fine. I've got somebody in the bedroom that's standing there at the window ready for you and
[19123.96s -> 19133.11s]  he's paid way more than you could ever pay. You don't think I'm going to have like a series of
[19133.11s -> 19139.54s]  like 30 different tunnels built privately that I'm going to get I can always escape and bring like
[19139.54s -> 19146.26s]  30 of my most loyal men and women and we then oh then what then you're going to take over the
[19146.26s -> 19153.26s]  castle oh yeah you are don't think so and I'm going to be a good king I'm not going to be mean
[19153.26s -> 19158.62s]  to you at least unless you don't mean if you don't do what I say then then come on I'm the king.
[19163.86s -> 19170.98s]  He's going to be you're going to be Lord Farquaad. Somebody said this the other day I've been laughing
[19170.98s -> 19176.90s]  about it ever since. It's like everyone has you build up your houses we have like a series of
[19176.90s -> 19185.50s]  houses and people populate them and role play and walk around and give bring me things and like
[19185.50s -> 19190.22s]  somebody just pulls out an enchanted arrow and shoots me in the fucking head during one of these
[19190.22s -> 19195.18s]  like tell me your grievances and I'm instantly dead it's over and it's like all the work was for
[19195.18s -> 19201.64s]  nothing but that makes me laugh so I don't care. You're going to get like we're going to check
[19201.64s -> 19205.96s]  your items to see what you have you can't come into the throne room with like an enchanted bow
[19206.04s -> 19217.77s]  what am I going to let that happen there's going to be metal detectors that you have to go through
[19217.77s -> 19230.47s]  before you come to the throne room but anyways once an idea pops like into my brain and the
[19230.47s -> 19236.47s]  original idea for those of you that weren't here was WoW Classic where I didn't want to play WoW
[19236.47s -> 19241.67s]  Classic because I was grilled about hey why the fuck didn't you make the guild you should have
[19241.67s -> 19245.35s]  made that guild that you promised and I said I got to level seven and quit the game because I was
[19245.35s -> 19249.59s]  stupid I didn't like it right I don't want to do this again I want to play WoW Classic again
[19249.59s -> 19255.59s]  right I was going to make a guild and then it was like well if I play WoW Classic anyways people
[19255.59s -> 19259.83s]  are just going to be like a hundred people around me just like all bringing me shit and like killing
[19259.83s -> 19263.56s]  each other and I was like I'm not going to play the game I was walking around like looking at
[19263.56s -> 19268.90s]  stuff and then I was like all right well fucking I'll do it and if I if I die then streams over
[19268.90s -> 19272.18s]  and then it was like okay well that's incentive for people to like protect me and then people
[19272.18s -> 19277.82s]  to kill me and then it's like all right fucking I'm not gonna do anything I want to give I want
[19277.82s -> 19282.30s]  like 50,000 gold and like all the best bounce in the game and if I'm hurt I get the streams over
[19282.30s -> 19290.71s]  and then it's kind of just piled on top of that decided maybe WoW is probably not the best idea
[19290.71s -> 19302.92s]  it might still be funny to do that as one of the one of the weeks we'll see five minute stream
[19302.92s -> 19307.72s]  once a week well that wouldn't be the only thing I'd be doing that would just be like you know
[19307.72s -> 19313.32s]  Saturday night is the fuck the king you know what I mean that's like what we do on like Saturdays
[19313.32s -> 19329.16s]  for a few weeks fuck the king friday I just see all these scenarios where I'm like trying to escape
[19329.16s -> 19333.56s]  from my tunnel like okay we get overrun this castle gets taken okay they've risen up and
[19333.56s -> 19339.32s]  they've taken over and I go through one of my tunnels and I I like pop out I have to like dig
[19339.32s -> 19344.12s]  up because like I'm sorry it's like five of my loyal bodyguards and we're like fucking escaping
[19344.12s -> 19348.36s]  and I dig up and I'm like I got we get stuck and get lost and there's like a hundred people
[19348.36s -> 19359.34s]  surrounding me like me pop my head like a like a prairie dog you don't think I'm gonna have like
[19359.34s -> 19369.21s]  fucking dragons and shit good luck or you could just be civil and just we could be in the kingdom
[19369.21s -> 19383.56s]  and who cares I don't need to die but that's it we're gonna probably try to come up with
[19384.36s -> 19392.02s]  some incentives to why I would not be dead you know why why protect me what would you what do
[19392.02s -> 19400.54s]  you gain from that spitballing ideas for that sounds fun and then there's like other factions
[19400.54s -> 19405.26s]  that arise of people that want to take over they might even be fighting between the viewers
[19405.90s -> 19420.98s]  and I have nothing to do with it I step in I'm just like trying to like correct it music oh shit
[19422.04s -> 19425.24s]  but that was legend bumble I just want to play it for a few hours and end up playing it for more
[19425.24s -> 19433.32s]  than five I think it's very fun you let me lie in bed with that and I'll play it every night
[19433.32s -> 19452.78s]  for at least a few weeks any interest in halo reach when it comes out yeah I'm gonna probably
[19452.78s -> 19457.38s]  play all of them that seems like a really just fun thing to do because I've never played any of
[19457.38s -> 19469.08s]  the halo games that just seems like a no-brainer but let's go back to five and a half hours ago
[19469.08s -> 19476.60s]  we had martin had a meme gave a thousand bits thank you martin germa you got a nice looking
[19476.60s -> 19483.46s]  bumbo haha just kidding thanks to the thousand bits appreciate it by the way for those of you
[19483.46s -> 19502.90s]  wondering I will be back on uh Thursday Thursday afternoon pepe hands he hates us
[19504.18s -> 19510.01s]  you guys go right to that every single time I had a lot of fun today you guys it was fun thanks for
[19510.01s -> 19517.06s]  helping me it's just that's it was just chill it was just fun it was stressful sometimes but that
[19517.06s -> 19530.33s]  was just fun I'm gonna play more puzzle games with you guys no but thank you seriously to martin had
[19530.33s -> 19538.54s]  a meme for a thousand bits appreciate it peaceful hailey thanks for the 250 germa how are you I'm
[19538.54s -> 19542.55s]  doing pretty good uh I want to ask you a question maybe it might be dumb but I guess I just kind of
[19542.55s -> 19547.03s]  want to know do you ever think about your view count while streaming like if it goes below a
[19547.03s -> 19552.81s]  certain number does it bother you anyways hope you're well have a good night no not at all
[19555.85s -> 19566.39s]  the view count on this stream fluctuates huge because if there's a big event stream you know
[19566.39s -> 19570.15s]  let's say like once a month some months every like 30 to 40 days there's like oh wow there's
[19570.15s -> 19576.15s]  an event like the halloween stream or the carnival or the green screen stuff I mean they might be
[19577.27s -> 19582.70s]  eight ten twelve thousand people concurrently watching those streams and that's awesome but
[19582.70s -> 19588.20s]  yeah I can't I can't expect that that's not that's not gonna happen every time I also do like yeah
[19588.20s -> 19592.92s]  somebody just said that was my next point I play and do so many different things on this stream
[19593.64s -> 19601.08s]  every single time that there's no way it would be the same amount of people every time
[19601.96s -> 19610.58s]  like for like today right I mean this still there's still a lot of people here
[19611.30s -> 19616.02s]  but the dude the people that don't want to watch me play like a match for bumbo game
[19616.58s -> 19622.10s]  you know they'll just kind of take off whatever I think any genre any game it doesn't really I
[19622.10s -> 19626.98s]  don't care about like genres and what the exact game I'm playing is I don't really have like that
[19626.98s -> 19634.47s]  anchor video game where it's like hey guys two or three times a week I'm gonna play overwatch or
[19634.47s -> 19644.25s]  dota or something right there's not that anchor video game that I play every day or every week
[19644.25s -> 19651.99s]  so I can't let a view count get into my head for any reason because there's no it's these streams
[19651.99s -> 19657.74s]  are just kind of all over the place by design so how could I expect people to be that the views
[19657.74s -> 19667.21s]  are gonna fluctuate all the time so no that does not bother me at all that is I mean we make jokes
[19667.21s -> 19671.61s]  sometimes like oh all right well how many people just left 500 people just left because I said that
[19671.61s -> 19680.14s]  but it's all just bullshit and I'm just fucking around you guys know that but no it doesn't I
[19680.14s -> 19688.97s]  don't really think about it that much at all show it's we're begging you to show auto he's sleeping
[19688.97s -> 19699.34s]  in the other room I mean if you think I care about view counts I do you really think I would be
[19699.34s -> 19704.30s]  laughing as hard as I am sometimes about how bugleberry dropped two to three thousand
[19704.30s -> 19712.66s]  concurrent viewers on the halloween stream I that that like it made me laugh I wasn't like oh fuck
[19712.74s -> 19726.50s]  no my views that's like it's all right I get it I get it but I hope that answers your question
[19726.50s -> 19734.46s]  kind of long-winded but hopefully it answers what you were asking hey bob boy you get five
[19734.46s -> 19743.00s]  gifted subs I didn't even see it thanks bob boy it was the echo in the sound I know that makes
[19743.00s -> 19748.20s]  it so much worse but funnier is like the sound was so un-fucking-bearable that if people just
[19748.84s -> 19757.78s]  I can't listen as I'm fucking leaving and I did the loudest noise I've ever done on a stream
[19758.76s -> 19761.40s]  it's just there's so many reasons why people would leave
[19764.66s -> 19778.38s]  whatever it's all good it just makes me laugh but thank you thank you ball boy ball boy with
[19778.38s -> 19784.38s]  the five subs and 1500 bits half-life alex was just announced as the flagship vr title by valve
[19784.38s -> 19789.26s]  I hope it's thank you for the 1500 bits by the way but I do hope it's actually a video game I do
[19789.26s -> 19795.34s]  I really hope like I said earlier I hope this is not a tech demo for a new peripheral that's like
[19795.34s -> 19800.54s]  an hour and 10 minutes I hope this is a real game like a flagship actual full vr video game
[19801.66s -> 19810.98s]  it's supposed to be a full game but is it a full vr game because most full vr games are like two to
[19810.98s -> 19816.26s]  three hours it's 12 to 16 hours you gotta be kidding me okay well then that's awesome I'm
[19816.26s -> 19825.37s]  glad that that's now a known thing it's 12 to 15 hours it's not a tech demo for new tech it's a
[19825.37s -> 19832.52s]  demo for old tech they haven't confirmed anything yet all right well I'm gonna my hands I'm just
[19832.52s -> 19838.07s]  gonna pull my hands back and just not just be like okay whatever it ends up being I hope it's very
[19838.07s -> 19847.05s]  good because it has been a very long damn time since valve actually made a video game yes artifact
[19847.05s -> 19871.30s]  came out but did it though like I it came out yes it released but and then I know but uh they've
[19871.30s -> 19881.32s]  made a couple of games but if you love artifact and you like it then I'm glad you do but I would
[19881.32s -> 19895.62s]  have much rathered something else than card game number like 30 no one does any artifact fans here
[19896.66s -> 19905.42s]  click on the link all right yeah why what's why am I naked what I'm not that hairy what's with the
[19905.42s -> 19915.40s]  hair all it's probably hairy but I hope it's good I really do if I will play it is it index
[19915.40s -> 19929.42s]  only if it is and that sucks no okay good thank you squad dollar for the 300 bits

[20054.49s -> 20060.62s]  to invite a bunch of streamers to do this I'll give you one reason why I'd like to do it once
[20060.62s -> 20069.82s]  or twice because if it just is a absolute mess then I just wasted a bunch of people's time
[20070.82s -> 20074.34s]  okay you you uh you want to do it yeah that sounds fun y'all be here at seven o'clock okay
[20074.34s -> 20078.68s]  you yeah well we're all doing it and somebody enchanted blows me the head and I turn my stream
[20078.68s -> 20083.24s]  off after five minutes it's just like what the fuck do these people do now well I want to I want
[20083.24s -> 20086.84s]  to get like one or two under the belt to make sure it's like even going to be something that's fun
[20087.80s -> 20097.19s]  it's an experiment that we're going to do so we'll get one under the belt maybe two and then
[20097.19s -> 20110.20s]  we'll start to potentially see if anybody else wants to do it but yes there's that is a thought
[20110.20s -> 20119.64s]  absolutely hey dark soul thanks for the 250 I said I wasn't going to donate bits for now but your
[20119.64s -> 20126.49s]  letter was very convincing anyways please play metroid prime one through three on stream and
[20126.49s -> 20141.51s]  I won't have to eat my game cube thank you imagine you imagine a streamer doesn't play

[20160.17s -> 20166.15s]  how do you eat a game cube do you just melt it down the plastic and then just drink it
[20175.75s -> 20179.27s]  that's an interesting thought those games are supposed to be really good by the way have never
[20179.27s -> 20185.69s]  played any one of them yes I know it's like oh whoa how have you not played metroid prime
[20186.25s -> 20193.11s]  I've seen it played I've seen it played for like 20 minutes I have not played it myself there's a

[20280.33s -> 20284.17s]  now I hope it gets a lot of attention so then I hope valve decides hey wasn't it fun when we
[20284.17s -> 20292.34s]  made video games that people liked that was cool maybe we should do that again but thank you joe
[20292.34s -> 20302.66s]  yes I'll be playing it within three days of it coming out I would say thank you I think I can for
[20302.66s -> 20308.65s]  the thousand bits appreciate it germa you know many other content creators have gotten you know
[20309.45s -> 20314.81s]  you know many hold on I'm speaking strangely germa you know many other content creators have
[20314.81s -> 20320.57s]  gotten me to laugh some of you made me laugh crying but no one has ever made me legitimately
[20320.57s -> 20331.13s]  fear for my life from laughing so hard that it hurt throughout my whole body you uh you're the
[20331.13s -> 20334.65s]  greatest person I've ever watched and I want you to know that I absolutely adore your streams and
[20334.65s -> 20339.13s]  you yourself please keep doing this for as long as physically possible I'm looking forward to
[20339.13s -> 20348.82s]  your retirement home streams that's a that's a incredibly nice thing to say I hope you don't
[20348.82s -> 20354.89s]  end up being killed from laughing at this stream but I will tell you there has actually been three
[20354.89s -> 20367.11s]  or four times where I thought that I was actually in danger the last time it happened was um sims
[20367.11s -> 20375.13s]  four is I mean I was I seriously thought that something bad was going to happen to me and it
[20375.13s -> 20379.61s]  was not what you think it was the dogs the guy doing drugs and walking his dog in his house
[20380.74s -> 20390.39s]  it was so so fucking funny it was unbearably funny and then dogs were like rolling around
[20390.39s -> 20400.62s]  into the pee like why would you put a leash on a dog and then walk the dog in your house
[20401.34s -> 20409.80s]  that you're just so fucked up on drugs okay but the actually the last time recently was in planet
[20409.80s -> 20414.36s]  zoo when I was trying to get the the monkey to climb out of the enclosure and he kept taking
[20414.36s -> 20428.41s]  that way the long way and the alarms would sound I gotta be careful though because
[20432.12s -> 20436.44s]  it's hard if you laugh hard you can like I don't know I'm not even going to get into it but you
[20436.44s -> 20444.71s]  can like I feel like I may have given myself a hernia it's actually one of the things
[20445.43s -> 20457.10s]  that I'm being checked for soon so I mean full transparency here for the medical stuff I'm being
[20457.10s -> 20470.89s]  checked for a hernia I don't know I that's what I was told so it this is not what's happened I'm
[20470.89s -> 20477.96s]  just giving you a scenario that is so strange I don't even know if this is possible but can you
[20477.96s -> 20485.80s]  imagine a scenario where I laughed so hard at the sims 4 drug dog pee thing that I gave myself a
[20485.80s -> 20493.27s]  hernia last year can you imagine how fucking ridiculous that is I don't even know if that's
[20493.27s -> 20500.57s]  medically possible I am speaking totally out of my ass here I'm just saying that's fucking so
[20500.57s -> 20514.60s]  stupid I'm not even sure that that's even how that works but I am like out of all of all the
[20514.60s -> 20520.42s]  things I'm being checked for I've had my liver checked I'm having my throat down the tube into
[20520.42s -> 20527.30s]  my stomach to check for a hernia we're just trying to figure it out why I I I'm fine you know that's
[20527.30s -> 20543.90s]  everything's gonna be fine what a way to go you're gonna go no but I know but that's not even real
[20543.90s -> 20551.02s]  I'm just saying how fucked up would that be I want to make sure that's very clear on the record
[20551.02s -> 20560.63s]  that I have that's a total bullshit thing that I'm just saying so no that's definitely not what
[20560.63s -> 20576.90s]  happened but it'd be wild but anyways uh thank you I think I can for your 2400 bits I really
[20576.90s -> 20582.76s]  appreciate it the second part of your message here is I have an odd number of bits so this is
[20582.76s -> 20589.22s]  a separate message uh still appreciate you though my thoughts and opinions have not changed even in
[20589.22s -> 20593.61s]  the last 20 minutes good thing I didn't say anything in 20 minutes that you started to hate
[20593.61s -> 20600.25s]  me for hope you didn't watch last night's stream where I talked about mayonnaise and fries looking
[20600.25s -> 20607.19s]  forward to the coming of the king if life ever becomes too much I'll just lock myself in a room
[20607.19s -> 20613.19s]  and blast lock myself in a room and blast every germ of video full volume speakers right next to
[20613.19s -> 20627.34s]  my ears I would advise not doing that because you're gonna cause hearing damage but I thank
[20627.34s -> 20634.01s]  you I really appreciate it thanks for the 2400 fucking bits seriously you're gonna give yourself
[20634.01s -> 20642.26s]  an ear hernia thanks a lot thank you silent serenity for the 250 hey jerma if you could put
[20642.26s -> 20647.22s]  your brain in a jar and stream for the rest of eternity would you do it no no I don't want to
[20647.22s -> 20658.41s]  fucking be around forever I would rather you put my brain in a jar and like have me generate
[20658.41s -> 20666.70s]  electricity but hold on do we know if like I'm like like in a nightmare during that scenario
[20669.83s -> 20675.74s]  maybe we'll look into that he's already he already is a brain in a jar don't say that that's scary
[20679.14s -> 20686.79s]  it would be a low wattage now that is a factual statement but I know you're saying that because
[20686.79s -> 20693.94s]  you're saying I'm like stupid so it works both ways but it's not even real because your brain
[20693.94s -> 20698.58s]  guess what would have really low wattage too it wouldn't just be my brain it would be yours too
[20698.58s -> 20713.50s]  you got a low wattage brain too but thank you thank you elizabeth for the 250 you should hit
[20713.50s -> 20720.06s]  up criken with those fuck the king stream sounds like they're jam yeah I there's like I said I want
[20720.06s -> 20727.59s]  to get like one or two down I the lazy king that doesn't do anything stream with a thousand people
[20727.59s -> 20734.06s]  that's trying to kill you is fun on paper I just want to make sure it works in practice before I
[20734.06s -> 20737.82s]  ask it if anybody else is interested to come like have fun and role play on the servers
