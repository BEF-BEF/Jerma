[2.23s -> 8.01s]  That title could be better, couldn't it? That's as literal as you can get.
[8.01s -> 12.33s]  And that's not even Red Dead 2. That's Red Dead Multiplayer. What if people don't know I'm playing
[12.33s -> 25.69s]  the new one? How about, uh, Rootin' Tootin' Cowboy 2. Let's see, uh, Red Dead. There's no redemption
[25.69s -> 33.85s]  in there. That's the first one. That's the one that was for PlayStation 2. Red Dead...
[33.85s -> 50.17s]  I don't know, how do you... Multiplayer. Rootin' Tootin' 2 Multiplayer. Cowboys using the
[50.17s -> 67.59s]  internet. No, but that's not even in the game though. How about this? All right, give me a sec.
[67.59s -> 116.84s]  One sec. There. I made it an IGN article. Is that better? The lawless land of Red Dead
[116.84s -> 129.99s]  Redemption 2 Online. And then in brackets it's going to say, watch out for gnomes.
[129.99s -> 136.17s]  This stream is known to gnome. But anyway, hi guys. I didn't even... I gotta make a fucking
[136.25s -> 145.64s]  tweet. I gotta see... I gotta make a tweet first. Is this sponsored? I don't think you could even
[145.64s -> 151.56s]  get a Rockstar game sponsorship. I don't think that exists. I'm not sure it's a good thing.
[158.02s -> 164.10s]  They're gnome... they're gnome to gnome. Why am I... I'm saying this right now. I don't even
[164.10s -> 177.88s]  like that thing. All right, let's, uh, let's move this over here so we can actually see the
[177.88s -> 184.94s]  game. I'd say that's a good idea, isn't it? I have to sign my life away though. That's the
[184.94s -> 194.87s]  thing. This doesn't have, like, online policies. Just want to make sure everyone's aware on this
[194.87s -> 202.55s]  channel. Well, I just want to make people trickle in so I can talk about it. Give me
[202.55s -> 220.46s]  one second. What if I don't? What's all that... there's like fucking people smoking motorcycles
[220.46s -> 236.68s]  by. Just like... I can hear... I can still hear that guy. All right, so for those of you that
[236.68s -> 242.12s]  are fairly new to the channel or those of you that, you know, whatever, I want to make sure
[242.84s -> 246.44s]  that what I'm doing... because I come from a law background. Before Twitch,
[247.32s -> 253.64s]  uh, I was a... I was in a law firm. My parents owned... there was... they were a dual...
[254.44s -> 258.36s]  uh, they were husband and wife law team and I was the son and they were gonna bring me up as
[258.36s -> 262.36s]  like the law prince. So I need to read this shit and I'm gonna read it the whole time.
[263.00s -> 266.44s]  So I need to know what I'm getting myself into. So what we do is...
[269.56s -> 290.89s]  My mom and dad aren't gonna like me anymore! Hey, welcome to Red Dead 2 Online. I'm excited.
[292.47s -> 299.30s]  You just woke my dad up. Hey dad! It's me, the law prince!
[310.55s -> 314.55s]  All right, so how does this work? Am I gonna have fun? Should I turn off voice chat already?
[316.47s -> 324.28s]  Is there a story here? I'm so excited. I can't wait for the first person that right when I
[324.28s -> 339.43s]  fucking spawn puts me into a hogtie. I can't wait. I gotta make my character
[340.94s -> 345.22s]  choose a character. Okay, we're gonna go with this guy.
[348.12s -> 357.16s]  How much different is there, uh, is there a character creator? What's that, 6-1?
[358.28s -> 368.36s]  All right, we gotta get a good name. Good name. Hmm, I don't know what he looks like quite yet, so...
[374.89s -> 378.49s]  No, it can't be just a beer. It's gotta be something better than that.
[381.46s -> 384.82s]  No, I'm not even gonna look at chat. I'm not even looking at chat right now. I'm gonna come
[384.82s -> 452.49s]  up with my own name. No, no, what the fuck? No, not Prawn. Why? Prawny. Prawny Phil. Prawny PM.
[459.14s -> 467.98s]  Prawny Phil. Prawny Philadelphia. Prawny philosophy. Prawny Philip. Prawny Philip. Prawny
[467.98s -> 480.71s]  Philip is better. Why though? Because just wait till I make his hands.
[492.23s -> 499.58s]  No, no, Prawny Philip G. That's his name. Prawny Philip. Prawny Philip.
[506.97s -> 517.53s]  Prawny. That's an old west name. Prawny Phil. Oh fuck, I know why I named him that. I don't
[517.53s -> 525.67s]  know. I was thinking of Bill Murray last night. That's Punxsutawney Phil from Groundhog Day. Oh
[525.67s -> 542.31s]  well. Punxsutawney Prawny Phil. Okay, let's see. Oh, dude, I took a picture of my face
[542.31s -> 573.83s]  every day for five years. That looks good. Dude, I took a picture of my body every day
[573.83s -> 596.55s]  for three days. This is what happened. This is what my body did. Should it be like
[596.55s -> 612.44s]  18? This guy's 18. That's a lie. Does it actually change your face? No, this doesn't change
[612.44s -> 625.83s]  anything. 60. No, he's gonna be 18. Dude, I took a picture of my birth certificate of my
[625.83s -> 652.71s]  birthday cards every year since I was 18. He had a heart attack, fortunately. Prawny Build.
[652.71s -> 661.80s]  Prawny Skinny. Athletic. He's gonna, I mean, I have to make a Prawny guy. I can't just
[661.80s -> 676.17s]  not make a guy Prawny, right? Carefree. Broad. Narrow. The closer they are to the bridge of my
[676.17s -> 686.46s]  nose, the better. That's just the way it is. That looks pretty good. How do I change his
[686.46s -> 701.35s]  name? Wait, can I go even further than this? Customize, though. Oh, damn, you can. High
[701.43s -> 721.64s]  brow. Deep brows. Eye color. Green. Eye redness. We get red eyes. All right, this is the
[721.64s -> 737.32s]  seventh, this is the eighth dwarf. Looks smoky. This is a gnome. No, it's not a gnome. I said
[737.32s -> 742.76s]  dwarf. Like the seven dwarfs. It's not the seven, it's not the seven gnomes, guys.
[743.40s -> 759.13s]  That looks good. All right, I position up. Yeah, actually down. Down and in. All right, looks
[759.13s -> 773.50s]  good. Nose. Neutral. How do I customize? It's gotta be low and wide and it's gonna be long.
[774.38s -> 783.06s]  Long and long into the, let's see, long into the left, baby. Ha ha, it's a funny character.
[786.04s -> 796.23s]  I haven't even made him yet. I haven't even made the guy. What? You can't say that yet. I
[796.23s -> 805.83s]  haven't even made him. Just wait till I get to his hands. Smoocher. What the fuck does that mean?
[813.08s -> 817.24s]  Mouth position. Up is fine. I'm not gonna, I don't think I'm gonna have this beard.
[822.95s -> 826.23s]  Thin and narrow on the upper lip and then like a, like a big,
[827.03s -> 837.82s]  like he's got like, he's got like fucking chew in his mouth. Yeah, that looks good.
[860.25s -> 862.33s]  Keep the beard. Well, the beard is still there.
[862.73s -> 875.93s]  Ha ha, it's just Jerva Pluto. No, from the side. Look at him from the side. He looks like that
[875.93s -> 897.40s]  henchman from the Looney Tunes. Tilt high and wide. Go deep. Deep chin depth. Okay, all right.
[898.04s -> 919.85s]  So, is it a whistle? He's like a bird. Clarity? So what if it's not clear?
[923.93s -> 932.54s]  No, it's really breathy. It's going through his teeth. Teeth ready.
[933.18s -> 947.48s]  I like the really high pitched one. That means anybody can hear me from a mile away.
[950.55s -> 965.54s]  Nice style. Ow. Ugh. Jesus. These are not whistles. This is, I just turned on the TV
[965.54s -> 982.98s]  at grandma's house. All right, that one's fine. All right, attributes. Health. Oh,
[982.98s -> 988.82s]  is where we're gonna be. Careful. Two points left. I can't, can I not pull points away?
[989.62s -> 997.80s]  I'm gonna probably say health. Health is probably the most important thing. Health and stamina.
[997.80s -> 1006.14s]  Forget about Deadeye. You can use Deadeye online. Well, how does that work on the internet?
[1006.86s -> 1013.77s]  You turn off everybody's game for five seconds? Am I, are you able to actually do that to
[1013.77s -> 1022.98s]  other players? It's gonna make them really burly. Health is most important. I want to be
[1022.98s -> 1028.47s]  able to run around and like punch people and stuff. I like all funny. Okay, attributes. How
[1028.47s -> 1050.28s]  do I change his fronty philip? Turn based. Appearance. Scroll down. Oh, okay. This is
[1050.28s -> 1055.16s]  the only complaint I ever had about Red Dead Redemption 2 is you have all this room below
[1055.16s -> 1061.24s]  this. Like I know the number is there, but I wish they would just extend that menu down
[1061.24s -> 1067.82s]  like three slots. All right, so we got mouth and lips. Did that. Ears. Cheeks. Here we go.
[1067.82s -> 1076.84s]  Goofy. Large. You can click on them. I don't have my, I got a controller in my hand.
[1078.36s -> 1087.83s]  Neutral. No, we're not doing the comedy ears. I could make another Snow White reference here
[1087.83s -> 1094.31s]  though. These are all the dwarves. Small. Droopy. Goofy. Hold on a minute. Goofy.
[1095.11s -> 1101.75s]  Neutral. Large. Small. Droopy. Yeah, and there's only like four, like five gnomes.
[1101.75s -> 1110.20s]  Never mind. Keep that one. Cheeks. Let's take off. I need to take this off. Wide.
[1111.80s -> 1120.49s]  Uh, gaunt. Looks good. Teeth. Chompers. Plum. Warout. I need to take off the
[1122.14s -> 1142.14s]  hair for a second here. I mean, this one is pretty good. I'm not going to do this one.
[1142.14s -> 1145.42s]  This one's too easy to just be the fucking weirdo online.
[1147.78s -> 1160.70s]  No, I can't, I like this one. This one is just weird enough.
[1165.78s -> 1185.80s]  And the guy's 18. Blonde hair. Yeah, that's fine. Facial hair. Okay. 18 with a full,
[1186.52s -> 1198.49s]  like gray beard. Like dirty. That's fine. No, I don't like that. No, actually that's okay.
[1202.10s -> 1216.07s]  Lifestyle. What is it? What's, what's going on? Complexion. Get rid of the facial hair.
[1216.07s -> 1230.87s]  What is, what are they talking about? Oh. Oh, I see. Okay. He's 18. I mean, he could be,
[1230.87s -> 1238.57s]  right? Like, couldn't he be 18? This is just Chris Griffin. I accidentally made Chris Griffin.
[1239.13s -> 1244.65s]  Chris Griffin does look like this. Chris Griffin is 18. Or like 14 or something, right?
[1245.37s -> 1261.58s]  No, I'm not going to name him Chris Griffin. Why the fuck would I do that?
[1262.90s -> 1280.14s]  It's not going to be Chris Griffin. No. No. Do it. Do it.
[1298.94s -> 1314.28s]  Looks like Owen Wilson. Chris Griffin. No, I'm going to keep the facial hair off,
[1314.28s -> 1320.34s]  but his name is Prani Phil. Okay. I'm going to keep the fucking stupid hair.
[1320.34s -> 1323.46s]  I'm going to keep his fucked up face, but I'm not changing his name to Chris
[1323.46s -> 1341.69s]  Griffin. Okay. Attributes. We already did it. Appearance. That's Prani Phil. Get his beard
[1341.69s -> 1366.18s]  back. I kind of like it like this. No, that's it. What? What's with the background there?
[1376.49s -> 1380.17s]  No, guys, this is not all these. This is, this is Prani Phil.
[1384.02s -> 1389.94s]  Dumb and dumber. It really does look like, what's not Lloyd? Harry. No, it is,
[1389.94s -> 1397.51s]  it's Harry, right? It's just Harry from Dumb and Dumber.
[1405.22s -> 1409.30s]  I can't wait to get a shotgun shot directly into the back of my head when I spawn at the
[1409.30s -> 1413.06s]  at the newbie level one. Welcome to Goldshire.
[1426.92s -> 1431.90s]  So I'm in jail. They're going to come across me.
[1438.62s -> 1444.94s]  Hey, uh, hey, Lloyd. You with the hammer and you, you'll do. We need to perform a work
[1444.94s -> 1451.18s]  detail out in roads. Come on, get in. Open the gate. You guys think I'm out of place
[1451.18s -> 1455.93s]  and you don't think that guy is, you don't think saber tooth from X-Men is out of place,
[1455.93s -> 1474.22s]  but fucking Harry from Dumb and Dumber apparently is. Red Dead Online. Yeah,
[1474.22s -> 1478.94s]  I can't, I can't have a voice like this. I tell you what, I can't talk like that.
[1479.10s -> 1481.34s]  I'm going to keep this one and I'm going to be a Barney from.
[1495.86s -> 1498.74s]  And it's still Harry. Barney Rubble is Harry.
[1509.78s -> 1517.62s]  Education. So how does this all start? How does this start? How does this all start? I don't know.
[1518.65s -> 1526.01s]  Good day, gentlemen. Oh, don't do anything stupid. Nobody gets shot. Act like fools
[1526.01s -> 1530.81s]  and the pair of you will be dead within a minute. Now, what are your names? Jenkins
[1531.53s -> 1536.65s]  and Millican. Well, Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Millican throw your guns to the ground and
[1536.65s -> 1542.65s]  get on down here. They break me up. There's Arthur. Very glad to meet you. It's not worth
[1542.65s -> 1549.05s]  being rash. I found Arthur. What's going on? You get that salary whether these people escape
[1549.05s -> 1561.64s]  or not. Your wives presumably want you alive. Let them out now. Please. Okay. Okay. You all
[1561.64s -> 1568.86s]  run away. Aside from you. Try to stay out of trouble. This is a stroke of good fortune
[1568.86s -> 1576.46s]  for all of you. Use it. Okay. Now, Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Millican, be so kind as to
[1576.46s -> 1581.42s]  you in the back. You're the ugliest person in the whole carriage. You're coming with us.
[1581.42s -> 1589.13s]  Go on. Don't look back. Mr. Wynn, I believe it was $50 we agreed on. It was? Here's 50 each.
[1589.13s -> 1594.81s]  Each? Yes. Now get out of here, both of you. My employer and I appreciate your professionalism.
[1594.81s -> 1598.65s]  All we did was stand there and look tough. And you did it fantastically well.
[1599.61s -> 1604.09s]  I'm gonna be some storied criminal. How about you pick up these guns and we move out.
[1604.81s -> 1615.74s]  My mistress is waiting for us. Follow the string. You better get on this horse.
[1616.97s -> 1625.96s]  Now. Well, this is different. You can do anything in Red Dead Online too, right?
[1625.96s -> 1628.36s]  I haven't got far to ride. I can ride a horse? Ready?
[1629.77s -> 1633.94s]  Holy shit. I hope you'll. How does the controls work?
[1634.74s -> 1642.34s]  My employer. Okay. My name is Mr. Horley, by the way. Six months.
[1642.34s -> 1646.74s]  Well, hold X while riding to match the speed. This is fucking crazy.
[1649.06s -> 1652.50s]  If I tilt the stick left or right, I turn left or right.
[1655.37s -> 1658.41s]  How's that even possible? Like I'm not doing that in real life.
[1658.41s -> 1678.87s]  I'm going to strangle you. Hey, whoa. Easy, man.
[1679.99s -> 1682.87s]  I hope you mean in Red Dead Redemption 2 Online.
[1694.25s -> 1699.45s]  That's Horley. Okay, Horley. I'm ready to start my adventure on
[1700.25s -> 1709.54s]  Red Dead. There's a post right here. All right, let's do it. Let's do it.
[1724.58s -> 1727.22s]  See how good they're getting 3D in these things here.
[1727.78s -> 1732.04s]  Hello. Jessica, the clerk. How do you do? What did you tell him?
[1733.19s -> 1739.35s]  Nothing, as we discussed. Thank you, Horley. I do hope we have an
[1739.35s -> 1743.51s]  inconvenience to you dreadfully, but seeing as you would do to be hanged in a week,
[1743.51s -> 1746.55s]  I'm sure you don't object too strongly. That's very interesting to us.
[1746.55s -> 1752.47s]  I know you're innocent. Well, not perhaps exactly innocent, but not guilty of what
[1752.47s -> 1757.19s]  you were accused. I know you and those who were with you that died were little more than
[1757.19s -> 1762.87s]  patsies and that you were set up by one of three men or a woman, possibly by all of them.
[1762.87s -> 1765.91s]  Every time he makes a reaction, I feel like this is going to come out of his mouth.
[1768.95s -> 1772.31s]  And one of these people also made Mrs. LeClerc a widow.
[1772.31s -> 1779.19s]  And I will avenge my husband's death, so help me, God. But I will not avenge it upon them who did
[1779.19s -> 1786.07s]  not cause it or caused it unwillingly. Anyway, I'm sure this is all a touch confusing and
[1786.07s -> 1792.07s]  melodramatic. Where are my manners? Horley, please show our guests to their tent and
[1792.07s -> 1794.55s]  give them some fresh clothes to put on. Very good, madam.
[1794.55s -> 1797.43s]  Then serve us both a little refreshment. Certainly, madam.
[1798.39s -> 1800.55s]  This way. You'll find a change of clothes in there.
[1800.55s -> 1802.63s]  Hey, look, it's a camp just like in the regular main game.
[1802.63s -> 1806.55s]  Also a few other items you might need. A lasso, a knife, and a lantern, I believe.
[1810.68s -> 1813.96s]  Wardrobe, here we go. This is where we stand out from the rest of the crowd
[1814.76s -> 1824.30s]  in GTA Online because we purchased, we got the $70 hat pack, so we get to wear this instead.
[1828.50s -> 1831.46s]  All right, well, I just turned him into Ebeneezer Scrooge, so that's fine too.
[1842.20s -> 1850.25s]  Now vest, and no, he's gonna have a shirt on. He's turning, what does he, what does he look
[1850.25s -> 1858.57s]  like? He's turning into something. Oh man, this character from a movie.
[1862.74s -> 1866.10s]  I don't know who he's turning into. It's like a Muppet or something, I forget.
[1867.14s -> 1881.93s]  Who's the Muppet that looks like this? I think, well, no, that's,
[1882.81s -> 1896.66s]  just everyday shirt is fine. Yeah, that's good. All right, suspenders. Yeah, that looks good.
[1899.06s -> 1904.36s]  I don't like that color though, there we go. Dante from Devil May Cry. I don't,
[1904.36s -> 1919.67s]  I already told you, just wait till I get to his hands. Nevermind. All right, so we got gloves,
[1920.47s -> 1925.11s]  item up, weapon equipment. I don't have any equipment. I can't modify, I have a collar.
[1926.31s -> 1941.93s]  Open, full sleeves, boots. Yeah, I like that. Okay, pants. Level up to rank 24 to unlock
[1941.93s -> 1963.38s]  this item. What? Don't I already have it? Well, whatever. No, not bare feet, he'll step on a
[1963.38s -> 1969.32s]  fucking log and die. Guys, this is, this is like, this is like 19, like 24 or something.
[1969.88s -> 1975.94s]  I don't want to step on a log and die. So George Washington died. He got a splinter
[1975.94s -> 1987.51s]  and they fucking bled him to death. All right, exit the wardrobe when you're ready.
[1987.51s -> 1992.52s]  I'm ready. Exiting the wardrobe will finalize your starting clothes. Are you sure you want
[1992.52s -> 2020.47s]  to leave? Yes. Why am I so small? Oh, nevermind, she was up on the thing. Okay. I know what
[2020.47s -> 2026.87s]  that's like to have a photo that's manipulated. Standing on a hill in San Francisco, which should
[2026.95s -> 2032.71s]  be 2142 in italics. And I was at the bottom of the hill. And it was literally in out in some
[2032.71s -> 2038.95s]  restaurant San Francisco with a fucking sidewalks are like 75 degrees. And I'm all the way to the
[2038.95s -> 2044.15s]  end. I know what that's like. different bullets to those you possessed when you were arrested.
[2045.93s -> 2052.09s]  These fucking photo manipulation mistake. You were rounded up and sentenced to death
[2052.65s -> 2059.21s]  all because you came to town and didn't talk too much and seemed like you were nasty. Anyway,
[2059.21s -> 2068.17s]  cool story. The people who run Blackwater, Mr. Jeremiah Shaw, banker, real estate speculator,
[2068.17s -> 2075.61s]  and crook, Mr. Amos Lansing, ranch owner, these are the players and crook. Mrs. Grace,
[2075.61s -> 2078.97s]  when you get to the top of when you get to rank 10 in GTA online,
[2079.21s -> 2082.17s]  lover of the arts, you become this cutscene for all the new players
[2083.45s -> 2087.45s]  and have a bounty on your head. Why didn't they do that? A disgraced brother,
[2087.45s -> 2094.73s]  outlaw, wanted man and still in contact with them. All I ask of you is your help in finding
[2094.73s -> 2098.73s]  out quite what happened. This is the clerk would like to help you get back on your feet.
[2099.53s -> 2104.97s]  I do consulting work. Whatever your work may be. I don't judge. You want to rob?
[2105.05s -> 2111.53s]  Looks like that looks good. You want to save innocent folk? Do that as well. But you need me
[2112.09s -> 2118.17s]  just as much as I need you. I think we all understand each other. I hope we do. I kind
[2118.17s -> 2124.97s]  of missed the silent protagonist. Good. I look forward to rewarding you for killing.
[2124.97s -> 2129.05s]  Nobody ever seems to mention it. It's just accepted that you never speak.
[2129.85s -> 2137.05s]  You just listen in this country in the West. He was killed for greed. Foul greed when there's
[2137.05s -> 2142.33s]  quite enough for everybody. I don't care what your scruples are as to killing.
[2143.13s -> 2146.09s]  I will take the full burden. It feels really weird.
[2152.86s -> 2157.34s]  You know, on a second thought, no, I don't miss it. I don't, I don't really miss it.
[2157.90s -> 2163.03s]  Crips well enough. He's long past his prime, of course. I do miss it in some games, though.
[2163.03s -> 2168.87s]  Entirely crazy just yet. And he will help you better than most of his ilk. Crips.
[2170.07s -> 2177.48s]  Get up. Hello, partner. Horley. This is your new boss. Oh, pleased to meet you, partner.
[2177.48s -> 2182.92s]  JB Crips at your service. Was that a sign of respect back then? Camp established. Mrs.
[2182.92s -> 2186.76s]  Leclerc is a generous. That's a complete reverse now. Where are we headed?
[2190.14s -> 2194.22s]  All right. Where are we headed? I get to pick my select location for your camp.
[2194.86s -> 2199.18s]  Crips will set this up for you. A fee can be paid to move your camp again when you enter free
[2199.18s -> 2215.58s]  room. Okay. Camp. View and change camp settings. Set camp location. Okay. So I just
[2215.58s -> 2222.52s]  small camp. Daily fee is charged for camp maintenance. A small camp can hold between one
[2222.52s -> 2230.07s]  to four posse members. I can't do the larger. Well, large is $2. We're going to go to the Bayou.
[2230.87s -> 2238.81s]  I think that's the only thing we can do. Yeah. Here comes level one. This is where we're going
[2238.81s -> 2245.90s]  to go. Oh, sir. While Crips is establishing your camp, perhaps you can go to the station
[2245.90s -> 2252.06s]  and see the clerk, then head to see Clay Davies. He's a horse thief and not a terribly nice
[2252.06s -> 2265.72s]  one. Then meet Crips back at your camp. See you shortly, boss. Okay. Good luck. Pressing up
[2265.72s -> 2274.41s]  can be used to whistle for your horse. Yes. Just like in the other game. My horse is...
[2278.81s -> 2283.64s]  If you don't have any horses, this is your horse. Somebody just get five community subs.
[2286.09s -> 2293.90s]  Lightning Rider, thank you for the five community subs. Very generous of you.
[2293.90s -> 2305.34s]  Thank you so much. I got resubbed. Oh, there you go. You can thank Lightning Rider for that one.
[2305.98s -> 2313.54s]  Is this online? Oh, yeah. This is kind of like in GTA Online, where there was that initial...
[2314.50s -> 2318.18s]  You do the first couple of little missions and it teaches you how to play again,
[2319.59s -> 2326.26s]  sort of, and then the world opens up. So this is the... I got just a kind of shitty
[2326.26s -> 2335.66s]  horse. Got to go to the post office and find a new horse. I forgot how to play. So last night
[2335.66s -> 2339.42s]  we played this for like a couple hours just so I could familiarize myself with Red Dead again
[2339.42s -> 2343.61s]  because I hadn't played it in a couple weeks. I didn't need to do that. The game just teaches
[2343.61s -> 2355.18s]  you how to play again in the first like 40 minutes of this. So am I in my own instance
[2355.18s -> 2360.52s]  right now? Or are there other players? Like is it possible that I'm going to see a guy with
[2360.52s -> 2364.52s]  like a bear head on just like walking down the road throwing fucking grenades at people
[2364.52s -> 2379.02s]  and stuff? You're on your own. Okay. Well, that's interesting. So it is just like the first
[2379.98s -> 2389.30s]  time they tried this in GTA Online. Red Dead 2. Find a train as soon as possible.
[2390.10s -> 2394.34s]  No, let me get out of this tutorial. I don't want to... I'm not going to go train myself.
[2396.12s -> 2400.44s]  Free roam mission givers can be found across the map. The closest mission giver
[2400.44s -> 2404.92s]  will be shown on the radar when you enter free roam. So that is a free roam mission.
[2405.72s -> 2417.96s]  Okay. There's a rocket powered stage coach. Well, that sounds fucking fun.
[2432.97s -> 2437.85s]  Everyone you see is a person. So this person is just doing a fantastic RP job.
[2447.48s -> 2452.60s]  You might want to earn a little money. Well, some gentlemen have been robbing our stages and
[2452.60s -> 2457.08s]  they are not part of the club. If you catch my meaning, if you can make them go away,
[2457.08s -> 2462.76s]  I'm sure they will have something of interest to you. They're up at blue water marsh.
[2462.76s -> 2471.16s]  I need to see what you can do. Okay. Here, by the way, a catalog, the latest issue just
[2471.16s -> 2476.20s]  came into this armpit from a land more civilized. And if all works out, well,
[2476.20s -> 2483.32s]  my colleagues and I move around these stations as needed. And all of us are very discouraged.
[2483.32s -> 2489.83s]  We will all help a fellow sufferer with pertinent information. Good afternoon, sir.
[2492.54s -> 2502.36s]  Muppet with scally cap. God, I need to know this. It's the same person.
[2503.32s -> 2512.20s]  I think I, I'm pretty certain it was just a one-off Muppet from one of the random movies.
[2513.08s -> 2524.71s]  No, it's not beaker. It's like, it was like a one-off Muppet. All right. So let's go to the
[2524.71s -> 2545.94s]  volume. I'll find it. I think this Muppet was only in like three scenes in the whole
[2545.94s -> 2551.62s]  movie. And that's the only time he was ever used. And I think he did talk like this too.
[2551.62s -> 2555.54s]  I think it just was that we made, I don't know. I'm subconsciously making characters
[2555.62s -> 2570.66s]  that are in my brain. Great Muppet caper. Oh, yeah. I think the person got it.
[2573.43s -> 2592.63s]  Did you get it? I think it was. Is it the taxi driver? Yes.
[2595.82s -> 2598.86s]  You got him. You got him. All right. We have to watch this right now.
[2603.19s -> 2615.22s]  Yes, you got it. Wow. You found him. It's the taxi driver from the Great Muppet caper.
[2620.73s -> 2621.13s]  Hold on.
[2633.45s -> 2637.85s]  Where is it? Where is it? Nice eyes. Sturdy legs. And it might have been my imagination,
[2637.85s -> 2643.21s]  but I think she found me. Here he comes. Here he comes. Taxi. Where is he?
[2644.73s -> 2652.09s]  Runs in the family. Taxi. Taxi. I don't know why the cabs won't stop. Just leave it to me.
[2652.09s -> 2661.64s]  He's gonna, there he comes. Gonzo's gonna get him. Taxi. There he is. That's very effective.
[2672.55s -> 2675.35s]  That's it. That's it. It's the only time he was ever used.
[2682.68s -> 2690.55s]  How and why do, I don't know. I just, I remembered, but the best part about it is
[2692.07s -> 2697.03s]  who said that? That person deserves an accolade right now.
[2703.19s -> 2714.22s]  Oh, I did. Oh no. I forgot. I can't say that. Oh, that's so funny. That was,
[2714.22s -> 2718.14s]  guys, I'm gonna be completely honest with you. That was going to drive me
[2719.37s -> 2728.10s]  fucking crazy. I was going to sit here for probably, even after the stream is over,
[2729.48s -> 2738.07s]  in bed, lying down, at dinner. It would not have left me. Nobody help him next time. What,
[2738.07s -> 2759.83s]  you want me to like suffer? Streamer lies down at dinner. Moses, his name was the meme goblin.
[2759.83s -> 2782.76s]  So that was his name? All right. Search for the hideout. All right. Search, where is it?
[2782.76s -> 2787.16s]  Gang hideouts may appear across free roam. Enemies at these hideouts can be looted for cash
[2787.16s -> 2796.15s]  and other items. Okay. Something about this music is, something about this music is weirding
[2796.15s -> 2814.78s]  me out. Let's try to be a little bit stealthy about this. He dropped his gun to pull a different
[2814.78s -> 2823.05s]  one out. He was holding a toy. Oh, a guy's here. I'm going to pick up a real gun.
[2823.85s -> 2846.01s]  I'm doing pretty good. A whole squad. These guys are all in a party together.
[2846.73s -> 2860.01s]  Look at that. I, what do I get for doing that? 1800s Stormtroopers.
[2860.65s -> 2871.11s]  Oh, got another RP here. Our role player.
[2881.27s -> 2883.91s]  All right. The world will be influenced by your honor. Spare the banner in order to increase
[2883.91s -> 2890.87s]  your honor or kill them to lower it. I don't have my mic plugged in. So I am just like
[2890.87s -> 2902.66s]  the silent protagonist. No, I'm going to spare him. The Muppet taxi driver is a good guy.
[2902.74s -> 2918.60s]  Okay. Yes, I did try to punch him in the face. So you've just received a treasure map.
[2919.67s -> 2922.47s]  Hold, uh, to open your satchel and select the treasure map.
[2923.11s -> 2932.36s]  You're gonna go, are we going on a treasure hunt? Okay. Now install your rifle. I got
[2932.36s -> 2942.97s]  my rifle. I'm fine. Search this area here. Okay. For the treasure. I'm going to assume
[2942.97s -> 2955.08s]  this is how you make money in this game. That would make some sense, right? I'm online
[2955.08s -> 2963.99s]  now, man. So money is valuable. Items are valuable. Where did this guy go? Down here?
[2964.71s -> 2974.73s]  That was a real person. All right. Sure. Sierra for the treasure. Let's get back on the
[2974.73s -> 2989.14s]  horse. I have to go up here. Oh, by the way, it's been nearly 50 minutes so far streaming
[2989.14s -> 2995.78s]  and I have not fallen off the horse once. So that's a new record. It actually might be.
[2996.97s -> 3001.93s]  Anybody know if that's like actually a new record of not smashing into a tree or a rock
[3001.93s -> 3037.75s]  after 30, 40, 50 straight minutes? Emote. Emote wheel. Oh my God. Search the area. So
[3037.75s -> 3044.95s]  when does this actually come out? It's currently in beta, right? When does this actually release?
[3045.51s -> 3052.89s]  For real? Not like, oh, open the beta up. Is this closing in a couple of days? And then
[3052.89s -> 3062.71s]  coming back a month later or something? It's always going to be a beta. Wait,
[3062.71s -> 3071.67s]  I want to emote on this guy. I'm going to emote all up in this guy's face. I can't go. Oops.
[3072.63s -> 3085.06s]  I didn't fall off the horse. That doesn't count. So that's a west range. No, come on, man.
[3085.94s -> 3091.83s]  That is a really weird way to do that. So it's, you have to lock onto somebody.
[3091.83s -> 3129.10s]  R2, L, L, R1, R1 again for the wheel. Wave. No, he's not listening. R1, R2, square,
[3129.10s -> 3133.42s]  R1, then press R2. Kind of running out of buttons on the controller it seems.
[3136.33s -> 3145.29s]  Yeah, it's L2, R1, and then R1 if you want to change something. So it's L2, L2, R1, triangle.
[3149.10s -> 3159.06s]  Let's find that treasure. It's an eagle eye. Let's get off the horse. Well, I don't even,
[3159.06s -> 3164.71s]  why would I need to use eagle eye? Here it is. There's going to be money in here, right?
[3165.27s -> 3180.89s]  There's a brick. Ability card voucher. What? Gold bars can be used to purchase or unlock certain
[3180.89s -> 3186.57s]  items early. Once you own a hundred gold nuggets, these will automatically turn to a gold bar.
[3186.57s -> 3189.45s]  Shop items become unlocked as your rank increases. You can see your rank unlocks and
[3197.06s -> 3199.62s]  cash can be used to purchase a range of products and services.
[3202.07s -> 3206.15s]  So there's a current, there's a, there's an in-game currency and then a currency.
[3206.15s -> 3214.17s]  So there's money and then like MOBA gems. You've discovered an ability card.
[3214.17s -> 3221.91s]  Coupons can be redeemed to acquire your first ability card. They can be purchased and equipped
[3221.91s -> 3232.33s]  to offer certain boosts in combat situations. The triangle is the ability loadout. Select to
[3232.33s -> 3242.55s]  equip an active ability card in this slot. Okay, so this is, this is my dead eye,
[3242.55s -> 3246.87s]  these are my dead eye abilities. While dead eye is active, you slowly regenerate health.
[3248.33s -> 3255.32s]  Okay. While dead eye is active, you and your team members deal a little bit more damage. If more
[3255.32s -> 3259.16s]  than one member of your team has an, has this ability active, the effects do not stack.
[3261.70s -> 3271.61s]  You can paint targets onto enemies. I mean that's, that's pretty good. Yeah, taking
[3271.61s -> 3288.95s]  this one. Paint it black. You can upgrade it. It has its own experience. That's odd. Okay,
[3290.90s -> 3294.34s]  that's just normal dead eye. I mean I, I like the normal dead eye.
[3300.38s -> 3307.19s]  You now have a dead eye card. When aiming, press R3 to enter dead eye and use the card's
[3307.19s -> 3311.99s]  effects. Some cards require a weapon to be equipped. Yeah, now that would make sense.
[3314.81s -> 3326.18s]  Almost fell, but it didn't. Opens treasure chest. Cool. Four dollars.
[3326.90s -> 3339.98s]  Story mission. So what's considered a lot of money in Red Dead Online? 100 bucks, 50 bucks,
[3347.08s -> 3354.54s]  50 dollars? No, no, no. Forget about the guy that already broke into the game's data files
[3354.54s -> 3358.22s]  and gave himself like 50 trillion dollars. I'm talking about like for real,
[3359.26s -> 3372.65s]  for real video game, in-game currency-wise. Is it the cost of the game? 59.99? Now that would
[3372.65s -> 3386.23s]  be fun. If it was 60 bucks and that was like expensive. Some of the horses go for 60
[3386.23s -> 3397.91s]  gold bars, which is that's 600 or six. What's the nugget to bar conversion? Is it 101 or
[3397.91s -> 3417.00s]  a thousand to one? Is it 101? Don't. We're good. Four dollars is probably a steak dinner.
[3417.80s -> 3432.02s]  Clay Davies is far away, ain't he? Jesus, Jerma, if you don't know the nugget to bar
[3432.02s -> 3438.28s]  conversion, you will never make it to the finals. I'll make it to the finals just based
[3438.28s -> 3451.35s]  on my pure skill shot. I don't need to, look, I don't need to understand. I just need to do,
[3454.86s -> 3463.85s]  right? I don't, okay, if you want to take the the basketball or baseball sports thing,
[3463.85s -> 3470.18s]  right? I don't even need to know how the game works. The goal is put that ball into
[3470.18s -> 3478.42s]  the basket and just don't cross this line when you do it. Okay, if I can get a swish every
[3478.42s -> 3482.90s]  single fucking time, no matter what happens, that's all I need to know. And I could get
[3482.90s -> 3486.66s]  that 50 million dollar contract just based on getting the ball in the hoop, even if I don't
[3486.66s -> 3505.00s]  know how to play the game. Start matchmaking for other players. I guess, I guess we're going
[3505.00s -> 3517.10s]  to find players. Is this the same streamer that made kids toys while eating pizza? Yep.
[3520.89s -> 3529.29s]  Game start. Players one out of one. Harley suggested that you go to see Clay Davies,
[3529.29s -> 3533.70s]  a horse thief, to learn the ins and outs of the horse rustling trade. All right,
[3533.70s -> 3546.81s]  I guess I'm just gonna ready up. Weapon loadout. All right. Honor among horse thieves.
[3553.74s -> 3562.38s]  Clive and Clay. Somebody already wanted to skip it. What? Skip the cutscene?
[3565.42s -> 3579.34s]  I want to see. I want to know what happens. Somebody in the party is just like, I don't
[3579.34s -> 3585.26s]  give a shit about any of this. I just want to drop dynamite in the middle of the team
[3585.26s -> 3586.38s]  right when we start the mission.
[3595.42s -> 3607.18s]  Oh, one out of four. Red dead players have ADHD. Sorry. It's probably three out of four.
[3611.82s -> 3616.46s]  Because guess what? I have it. And if you think that that guy has it, that's at least two out
[3616.46s -> 3632.06s]  of four. At least. All right, so go to the mill. Take it back to the horse thieves at
[3632.06s -> 3643.86s]  Rhodes and bring it to him at St. Dennis. So this is the squad, huh? This already feels
[3644.42s -> 3662.55s]  like a ju- wait, what? I can- is this gonna hurt him? Can I- I can jump on his horse. Okay.
[3666.23s -> 3670.87s]  That's interesting. All right, that was actually kind of cool. I want to know how fast you
[3670.87s -> 3676.47s]  can go and do that. All right, speed up. Get us up there so I can- I want to get
[3676.47s -> 3681.82s]  to the first place. I want to live vicariously through the person in first place by jumping
[3681.82s -> 3697.46s]  on their horse. How do I emote? All right, we need to steal a horse. Am I slowing the
[3697.46s -> 3703.88s]  horse down? I probably am. All right, so we get to steal the horse. Uh, this guy- this
[3703.88s -> 3717.05s]  guy is just kind of running in. How did that- what? How did that horse- no- oh god,
[3717.05s -> 3729.16s]  you just already did that, really? Oh my god. No, I want to shoot this guy. Give him cover.
[3729.88s -> 3742.87s]  It's exactly what I thought it was gonna be. This is the first mission, too. All right,
[3742.87s -> 3759.27s]  we gotta get a horse. Did I shoot the horse? All right, and he's- wait, which horse am I?
[3759.27s -> 3762.71s]  Wait, I'm in here first. Red. No. Blue. No, no, no, no. Which one do I want?
[3763.35s -> 3777.26s]  This one. Let's go. I already didn't get one. How did he- did he not get a- who didn't
[3777.26s -> 3785.45s]  get a horse yet? Which one of my crew members? Why are we not together?
[3786.25s -> 3797.38s]  Somebody died. Who died? What is- this guy didn't have a horse yet. Go get a horse!
[3798.26s -> 3803.13s]  No, I don't want that person- I have to help because that- somebody needs to go get their
[3803.13s -> 3823.88s]  horse. Oh well. What the fuck was that? All right, take the horse in the stable.
[3825.00s -> 3845.42s]  All right, I gotta get real close. Whoa! Are we waiting for the last person? Um,
[3845.50s -> 3856.90s]  excuse me. Excuse me. What? Where's our last guy? What's he doing all the way over there?
[3857.70s -> 3862.54s]  That guy- we- everyone shot that guy. Four hats came out of that guy.
[3863.34s -> 3878.79s]  He disappeared and he turned to the hats. Um, why are we standing here? Is there a reason
[3878.79s -> 3889.37s]  for this? Why can I not shoot? Okay, that was really weird. Leave him. Don't we have to
[3889.37s -> 3914.52s]  finish the mission together? You fucking asshole! You dick! That doesn't count. I was
[3914.52s -> 3925.34s]  intentionally sabotaged. I ran into him. He stopped- no, he stopped in the middle of the
[3925.34s -> 3933.42s]  road. He just went- he did that on purpose. He was trying to- he was making like a
[3933.42s -> 3947.13s]  compilation video. Now I'm in it. I get to be in it now. The funniest part about this,
[3947.13s -> 3953.96s]  is this still a guy that just rode down there to the west? I don't think that- that
[3954.12s -> 3967.90s]  guy- I don't think that guy knows what's going on. Did that person's horse die? Don't stop short
[3967.90s -> 3997.42s]  again. I got a horse. Mets. Some kind of suicide squad. I got to rank three.
[3997.90s -> 4006.98s]  The good thing about this, I'm happy that we all don't have to complete it. Just, we can't have two
[4006.98s -> 4014.38s]  people die. That guy just took off into the wilderness and started hunting.
[4032.20s -> 4038.84s]  I call him boy because I'm older. 30 minutes, he went black. Let's give our friend here back the
[4038.84s -> 4045.00s]  horse. Hey, thanks. It's yours. A sign of faith and future business. If you want to buy any
[4045.00s -> 4050.60s]  extras or sundries for the animal, head inside. Sundry? They've got a lot available. What's a
[4050.60s -> 4078.82s]  sundry? See you soon. Dude's face. What the fuck? All right, so services.
[4082.52s -> 4100.06s]  Rename the horse. I can't. Horse insurance. I guess just get it. Rename horse. How about-
[4101.02s -> 4140.60s]  uh, it can't be Phil. It's got to be something better than that. How about- I just used all my
[4140.60s -> 4157.37s]  money. That was seven dollars and fifty cents. I forgot I was online. I- I- this is just something
[4157.37s -> 4160.89s]  I just do in the regular game. I just buy it every time because I haven't bought a ton of
[4160.89s -> 4175.22s]  money. All right, whatever. Empty slot. I guess this is just free. Improved. Um, it's just
[4175.22s -> 4182.34s]  stock. Saddle voucher. All right, saddle bags. This is going to cost money, isn't it?
[4182.42s -> 4192.86s]  That's 80 bucks. Look at this shit. 22 dollars. Not enough. Buy now with one gold.
[4197.98s -> 4207.40s]  This shit ain't even worth it. Drain rate. It's- you just- you're paying- all you're paying for
[4208.12s -> 4216.09s]  is to get that 10% drain rate. The- the- you're not even- you can't even see that
[4216.09s -> 4224.54s]  from more than three or four feet away. So if you want to pay for a drain rate decrease,
[4226.44s -> 4239.40s]  buy a hundred gold packs on the- no. Absolutely not. Uh, we're just gonna do- just gonna do
[4239.40s -> 4254.04s]  default. Just buy the super horse. 21. No, that's too much money. Core drain. Oh, whatever.
[4254.76s -> 4257.88s]  I don't think I can do anything about the- this is probably gonna cost money too. Yep.
[4258.60s -> 4261.64s]  No, I have to keep- I just do default. I can't do anything interesting
[4262.20s -> 4270.07s]  because I need to buy a gun or something. Which version of the game is this? This is
[4270.07s -> 4274.74s]  the special edition. I didn't buy the ultimate edition because I didn't think it was worth it.
[4275.38s -> 4278.78s]  I didn't think it was- oh, whatever. I'll just get the- I'll get the one that you shouldn't
[4278.78s -> 4284.55s]  buy. The one in the middle. And I couldn't play yesterday. And I got like a cool horse
[4284.55s -> 4296.17s]  in the main game. All right, that's good. So am I in the open world now? You've
[4296.17s -> 4299.53s]  bonded with your horse after purchasing a saddle for it. Your horse is indicated by- yep,
[4299.53s -> 4313.88s]  yep, yep. V at the camp. See, I got the cool one. Knowing Rockstar, they'll be flying
[4313.88s -> 4319.38s]  horses soon. Yeah, if you want- look, if you want to play Red Dead Redemption,
[4319.38s -> 4324.58s]  and you want to play it at its very pure core, you gotta play within the next- I would say
[4324.58s -> 4329.70s]  within the next couple months. Because after a year of content updates, it's gonna feel like
[4329.70s -> 4335.61s]  steampunk in this game. It'll be like astronaut helmets, there'll be spaceships and shit.
[4338.73s -> 4341.29s]  Extra stalls can be purchased in the stables, these allow you to buy and manage
[4341.29s -> 4350.81s]  additional horses, right? If you want the real Red Dead Redemption 2 online experience,
[4351.61s -> 4360.18s]  I would- I would get involved in the next couple months. Before the guy that has $500,000
[4362.18s -> 4367.22s]  that just sends horses with like C4 attached to like blow up everybody standing in free
[4367.22s -> 4373.40s]  realm. That's not- that doesn't exist right now. It will. It's gonna happen.
[4374.36s -> 4387.13s]  Once people are able to battlefield people in this game, now I'm just shilling for Red Dead
[4387.13s -> 4391.85s]  On- no, no! I'm telling you, play it now. Don't play it later. Guess I am telling you
[4391.85s -> 4409.05s]  to buy it, am I? Yeah, I guess I am saying that. All right. Well, okay, for a second,
[4409.05s -> 4415.86s]  I was like, who the fuck is Sean and why are they in my game? Do you really need me to tell
[4415.86s -> 4421.86s]  you to buy Red Dead Redemption 2? Do I have to say that? Isn't it very obvious that this game
[4421.86s -> 4428.58s]  is worth playing? I gotta be careful with what I say about one of the best open world games
[4428.58s -> 4431.70s]  probably to come out in five to ten years. No, I gotta be careful!
[4441.94s -> 4442.50s]  Not really.
[4443.14s -> 4448.50s]  Think you did a good job for you? I'll earn my keep. When you get too old to fight,
[4448.50s -> 4453.54s]  what choice have you got? It's either work or beg. I'd rather work.
[4457.22s -> 4461.14s]  Now, he wants you to come down and meet him in Blackwater when you get a chance.
[4461.70s -> 4467.30s]  I think he might have some work for you. And while you're out on your travels,
[4467.30s -> 4473.86s]  you may see some folk with employment opportunities. Good folk, bad folk. Well,
[4473.86s -> 4477.14s]  should I? Hey, you decide if you want to purchase something or not.
[4477.14s -> 4483.14s]  Up to you if you listen to them. I will always tell you what I don't like.
[4486.90s -> 4492.82s]  This guy's beard is just frozen boogers. That's all it is. He's never wiped it off.
[4498.39s -> 4508.12s]  In probably two or three decades. General stores and tailors with supplies and clothing.
[4508.12s -> 4511.56s]  Here you go. Welcome to GTA Red Dead Online.
[4516.42s -> 4519.46s]  Find and accept free row missions from various characters like this guy.
[4520.10s -> 4520.74s]  Or this guy.
[4522.28s -> 4525.24s]  Or counter a rival player's mission for your own reward.
[4525.24s -> 4528.82s]  No. Really? Hold on. What?
[4530.46s -> 4533.18s]  Did they just say please grief everybody that's playing the game?
[4541.14s -> 4546.54s]  Hahaha. Hey, if somebody's trying to do a mission, fuck them up intentionally
[4546.54s -> 4550.38s]  by flying a fucking flying horse into the train in front of their mission.
[4550.38s -> 4551.42s]  You'll get rewarded for it.
[4553.11s -> 4555.19s]  I guess the whole game is about being like an outlaw.
[4555.19s -> 4556.95s]  So that doesn't go out of the ordinary.
[4557.91s -> 4562.74s]  Player many is used to this and receive invites.
[4563.30s -> 4569.78s]  Okay, I can either quick join. Ooh, I got a trophy.
[4570.82s -> 4572.58s]  You join or invite players.
[4573.46s -> 4579.51s]  Oh, MLC still is not playing this game.
[4587.03s -> 4594.90s]  Let's see. He has friends. Yeah, like one.
[4595.94s -> 4599.14s]  So I guess just join, view and invite. Quick join.
[4599.14s -> 4602.66s]  Join a series or story. Wait, wait, wait. Not yet. Wait a minute.
[4604.34s -> 4606.90s]  Camp's white flag is raised protecting you from other players.
[4606.90s -> 4609.30s]  Focus on the flag or use the player menu to lower it.
[4611.32s -> 4613.40s]  The camp's white flag is raised.
[4614.36s -> 4615.96s]  So that means nobody can come in here.
[4616.68s -> 4621.21s]  So this is where you're safe. As long as I have the flag raised.
[4622.09s -> 4623.56s]  Oh, they're okay over here.
[4627.06s -> 4630.33s]  Lower the flag. Lower the flag.
[4632.39s -> 4633.11s]  Let them come.
[4633.75s -> 4637.22s]  Some items can be purchased through the catalog.
[4637.22s -> 4640.41s]  You have a new person.
[4641.21s -> 4642.01s]  That is uh-oh.
[4645.21s -> 4646.97s]  All right, let's open the handheld menu.
[4647.61s -> 4655.51s]  Hunting and fishing horses. So this is just the web.
[4655.51s -> 4657.27s]  Okay, so you can buy. I can just buy this from here.
[4658.47s -> 4663.67s]  That's cool. How much is a bow?
[4667.13s -> 4668.49s]  124 dollars.
[4672.82s -> 4677.22s]  724 dollars? Why is it so- how much higher than that?
[4678.78s -> 4680.14s]  900 dollars.
[4683.24s -> 4690.63s]  Okay. Well, I used to do this when I was a kid.
[4690.63s -> 4691.75s]  I was never going to get any of it.
[4692.39s -> 4694.39s]  But this is the equivalent of what I used to do.
[4694.39s -> 4695.91s]  I used to- okay, there used to be a-
[4697.45s -> 4701.45s]  like a Macy's catalog or like a JCPenney catalog would come in.
[4702.25s -> 4705.61s]  And there'd be a huge toy section.
[4705.61s -> 4706.65s]  And I would just go through
[4706.65s -> 4708.89s]  and I would just circle all the toys that I ever wanted.
[4709.69s -> 4714.58s]  And that's all I can do.
[4715.30s -> 4717.46s]  Oh god damn it. Hold on.
[4717.46s -> 4726.84s]  How do I like turn that off?
[4737.74s -> 4738.78s]  This is not going to stop.
[4740.60s -> 4741.72s]  Notification settings.
[4748.49s -> 4749.93s]  That's just- it's just going.
[4749.93s -> 4751.29s]  I thought I already had that set.
[4753.86s -> 4754.74s]  Notifications.
[4759.48s -> 4760.44s]  Notification settings.
[4760.44s -> 4761.48s]  I thought I already had it off.
[4761.48s -> 4762.68s]  Yeah, pop up notifications.
[4764.06s -> 4765.18s]  No, no. Just disable.
[4766.06s -> 4768.38s]  No notifications. Absolutely none of them at all.
[4768.38s -> 4772.02s]  I think I got it.
[4772.66s -> 4777.11s]  Are we good?
[4777.11s -> 4777.67s]  I think so.
[4778.31s -> 4779.69s]  We're good.
[4779.69s -> 4780.25s]  All right, we're back.
[4787.51s -> 4791.42s]  Okay, so let's just- just take a look.
[4791.42s -> 4795.06s]  I should probably put this back up, shouldn't I?
[4795.78s -> 4797.46s]  Just hit- that's the wrong button.
[4798.26s -> 4799.94s]  And I don't want to run the ammo in this game.
[4799.94s -> 4800.90s]  Raise it. Raise it.
[4802.25s -> 4804.17s]  So I can't wait to get chased by somebody
[4804.17s -> 4806.65s]  and then stand behind here and just point and be like,
[4807.45s -> 4808.49s]  you can't get me.
[4809.45s -> 4812.09s]  Like the guy that drives over the Mexican border
[4812.09s -> 4813.69s]  at the end of the action movie.
[4814.25s -> 4816.41s]  And there's a- there's a confrontation between the-
[4816.41s -> 4818.25s]  like the cop and the bad guy.
[4818.25s -> 4819.69s]  And like I can't do anything about you.
[4820.57s -> 4822.44s]  I can't wait to have one of those scenarios.
[4829.59s -> 4830.15s]  One more.
[4830.71s -> 4831.43s]  Give me one more.
[4831.99s -> 4834.33s]  Continue playing to access your bonus content.
[4835.05s -> 4836.87s]  You made that joke.
[4837.51s -> 4838.01s]  When?
[4839.77s -> 4840.09s]  When?
[4840.09s -> 4840.97s]  What was the scenario?
[4841.69s -> 4847.40s]  You already made- but when?
[4847.40s -> 4848.44s]  When did I make the reference?
[4849.08s -> 4850.86s]  Does anyone remember what game it was?
[4860.41s -> 4864.44s]  50- 50,000.
[4864.44s -> 4865.24s]  Oh, okay.
[4867.88s -> 4868.36s]  All right.
[4868.36s -> 4873.96s]  First- I thought somebody just gave $50,000 to the stream.
[4873.96s -> 4875.16s]  And I was like, no, they didn't.
[4875.96s -> 4878.01s]  I was like, no, fucking what?
[4879.58s -> 4880.78s]  Everybody freaked the fuck out.
[4880.78s -> 4882.14s]  I see 50k.
[4882.14s -> 4882.78s]  50k.
[4882.78s -> 4884.30s]  I'm like, no, what happened to 50,000?
[4884.30s -> 4884.78s]  What happened?
[4884.78s -> 4885.82s]  Do I have to- what happened to it?
[4889.32s -> 4890.76s]  No, it's just fucking seagulls.
[4892.52s -> 4893.88s]  It's just a bot that was there.
[4894.68s -> 4896.82s]  All right, let's go do a mission.
[4897.46s -> 4898.87s]  Let's go.
[4898.87s -> 4899.43s]  I'm gonna- wait.
[4901.61s -> 4903.69s]  Don't dream so high, man.
[4904.89s -> 4905.77s]  I'm not- no.
[4905.77s -> 4907.13s]  I just freaked out for a second.
[4908.17s -> 4908.49s]  Okay.
[4909.93s -> 4911.69s]  There are almost 4,000 people here, right?
[4911.69s -> 4914.41s]  When, like, the chat blows up like that, and I just see 50k.
[4914.41s -> 4915.13s]  50k.
[4915.13s -> 4917.13s]  And a ton of, like, fucking pog champs.
[4918.17s -> 4918.81s]  Is this a player?
[4919.69s -> 4927.86s]  I mean, I- what am I supposed to think?
[4927.86s -> 4928.98s]  I'm like, 50,000 what?
[4929.78s -> 4932.74s]  And then my brain said, wait, 50- everyone's freaking out.
[4938.06s -> 4939.50s]  You didn't think I was gonna do it!
[4939.50s -> 4940.70s]  You didn't think I was gonna be able to get it,
[4940.70s -> 4941.18s]  but I got it.
[4941.74s -> 4946.60s]  This is gonna impede me.
[4947.24s -> 4952.01s]  I need to just get into, like, a lobby.
[4952.65s -> 4956.46s]  Have I used any microtransactions?
[4956.46s -> 4957.58s]  No, not yet.
[4957.58s -> 4963.67s]  I just want to jump over this.
[4964.84s -> 4965.24s]  No.
[4965.24s -> 4965.88s]  No, I didn't do it.
[4965.88s -> 4966.68s]  Do I- did I do it?
[4967.48s -> 4969.40s]  I did.
[4971.72s -> 4972.20s]  Yeah, I did.
[4972.84s -> 4973.70s]  Oops.
[4973.70s -> 4974.26s]  No, we're fine.
[4977.26s -> 4978.22s]  Not yet.
[4978.22s -> 4978.70s]  Well, no.
[4978.70s -> 4979.82s]  Not yet as in no.
[4979.82s -> 4980.78s]  Not ever.
[4980.78s -> 4982.06s]  I should have been more clear.
[4982.78s -> 4990.18s]  I'm not gonna buy gold bars.
[4990.98s -> 4996.25s]  If I was gonna spend $100 in this game and buy gold bars,
[4999.18s -> 4999.98s]  I would- no.
[4999.98s -> 5003.42s]  I would just- I would go take that money to the casino
[5003.42s -> 5005.02s]  and just put it on double zero.
[5005.82s -> 5007.26s]  Because, hey, guess what?
[5007.26s -> 5011.50s]  There's a small chance that I just made, like, 35 fucking hundred dollars.
[5012.38s -> 5017.03s]  Oh, there are players here.
[5019.19s -> 5019.59s]  Really?
[5019.59s -> 5019.83s]  Okay.
[5020.55s -> 5023.21s]  I see the little blips on the map.
[5023.21s -> 5023.69s]  Where are they?
[5024.33s -> 5027.42s]  Are they only on the minimap or are they on the large map?
[5028.34s -> 5029.06s]  Ooh, okay, hold on.
[5029.06s -> 5030.10s]  There's a person here.
[5030.10s -> 5031.43s]  Okay.
[5032.07s -> 5038.18s]  Kill them.
[5038.18s -> 5038.42s]  No.
[5039.90s -> 5043.02s]  I'm not gonna start the never-ending cycle of Rockstar
[5043.10s -> 5044.62s]  online game insanity.
[5045.42s -> 5050.46s]  If I shoot this guy, it will never end because even if I leave,
[5051.02s -> 5053.82s]  I'm gonna shoot this guy and then I'm gonna leave.
[5053.82s -> 5056.94s]  This guy's gonna be angry and he's gonna shoot the guy that's next to him down there.
[5056.94s -> 5059.50s]  That guy's gonna get angry and shoot the guy that spawns next to him.
[5059.50s -> 5061.34s]  It's never going to end the cycle.
[5061.34s -> 5062.22s]  It stops here.
[5062.22s -> 5062.94s]  I'm not doing it.
[5096.79s -> 5097.43s]  What was that?
[5098.07s -> 5101.16s]  How do I do the mission?
[5101.80s -> 5106.47s]  I just started the cycle and now the cycle is never gonna break.
[5107.19s -> 5112.20s]  Where's this mission?
[5112.84s -> 5126.12s]  And you see, I shot that guy.
[5126.76s -> 5130.55s]  That guy shot somebody else and then that person went into another game.
[5131.59s -> 5137.37s]  Fuck this and shot somebody else and then eventually it kept going
[5139.05s -> 5143.66s]  and eventually they got to a point where somebody shot the server.
[5148.07s -> 5162.14s]  Uh, all right, just go to free room if I can even get in.
[5162.86s -> 5170.44s]  Yeah, somebody in game ran around and they found the box
[5171.24s -> 5172.87s]  that's plugged in.
[5175.38s -> 5177.70s]  That's the way that they get to have all the servers open.
[5177.70s -> 5179.46s]  That guy just shot the fucking router in the game.
[5190.73s -> 5193.69s]  This dead worked, but what if I did just get banned?
[5195.32s -> 5195.96s]  Imagine that.
[5203.99s -> 5207.51s]  That's a fault on Rockstar for putting the router in the game.
[5209.72s -> 5215.66s]  True talk, is this really good?
[5216.30s -> 5217.90s]  I don't, I don't know.
[5217.90s -> 5218.78s]  I didn't really get to play it.
[5221.53s -> 5222.73s]  Oh God, really?
[5224.65s -> 5227.53s]  Due to a fault on Rockstar game services.
[5228.25s -> 5231.99s]  What does that code mean?
[5232.79s -> 5241.35s]  Hold on, is it just off?
[5246.46s -> 5246.86s]  Banned?
[5247.58s -> 5248.38s]  Banned.
[5248.38s -> 5249.82s]  No, I'm not banned.
[5249.82s -> 5253.34s]  The server, somebody fucking unplug the server in Rhodes Ranch.
[5257.69s -> 5258.81s]  Uh, let's see.
[5258.81s -> 5263.86s]  Oh, we got a fix for it apparently.
[5264.42s -> 5268.71s]  There's an easy fix for this problem.
[5271.77s -> 5280.22s]  Uh, back out of the menu by pressing the button and attempt to relaunch Red Dead Online.
[5280.78s -> 5283.18s]  Quit out of Red Dead and reboot the game.
[5284.14s -> 5287.85s]  Okay, so I have to reboot the game.
[5287.85s -> 5290.26s]  Hopefully that fixes it.
[5292.87s -> 5294.15s]  Wait an hour or two.
[5294.95s -> 5298.26s]  No, I'm not going to wait an hour or two.
[5298.26s -> 5306.18s]  See, I fucking told you that I shot that guy and it started a cycle of hatred.
[5306.18s -> 5309.06s]  And that's the, and eventually it got disconnected.
[5309.06s -> 5310.98s]  I got disconnected somehow.
[5311.62s -> 5323.37s]  All right, I'm going to restart the game, see if it works.
[5323.93s -> 5331.26s]  Somebody tries to find the root of the problem and I was the root of the problem.
[5347.32s -> 5348.52s]  That guy was the server.
[5350.39s -> 5351.27s]  You guys don't understand.
[5351.99s -> 5355.62s]  When I say, oh, somebody must have shot the server in the game.
[5355.62s -> 5356.74s]  That's like, that's what I did.
[5358.07s -> 5361.03s]  NPCs in this game are, it's a network.
[5362.74s -> 5366.39s]  Certain NPCs need to be left completely untouched.
[5366.39s -> 5369.27s]  Because they're the ones that are directly, they're making the whole thing work.
[5369.91s -> 5381.38s]  Let's try it again.
[5381.38s -> 5381.78s]  Here we go.
[5382.97s -> 5384.97s]  Are we going to get the same error?
[5386.44s -> 5387.64s]  That was the test you failed.
[5388.54s -> 5388.94s]  Damn it.
[5390.68s -> 5391.80s]  And I said it too.
[5391.80s -> 5396.20s]  I said, no, it's going to cause a cycle of bullshit and hatred
[5396.20s -> 5397.24s]  and it's going to disconnect people.
[5397.24s -> 5398.84s]  People are going to get angry, disconnect from the game.
[5398.84s -> 5399.64s]  And then, no, fuck this game.
[5399.64s -> 5400.84s]  I'm not playing this game ever again.
[5401.56s -> 5422.23s]  Do I like these loading screens more compared to GTA V?
[5423.27s -> 5424.15s]  Yeah, probably.
[5426.06s -> 5430.94s]  Mainly because the GTA V one was a static image that just changed to,
[5430.94s -> 5432.46s]  it was like the same three images.
[5433.18s -> 5441.21s]  I mean, these are also the same few images, but it's a little more muted.
[5442.01s -> 5443.37s]  And I don't know if this is going to work.
[5444.71s -> 5445.21s]  Ooh.
[5446.72s -> 5447.22s]  Mmm.
[5448.24s -> 5457.72s]  Server booting back up.
[5457.72s -> 5458.28s]  Initiate it.
[5459.16s -> 5462.54s]  Come on.
[5462.54s -> 5463.18s]  Let me back in.
[5463.82s -> 5471.44s]  Can you continue playing?
[5471.44s -> 5471.92s]  Got it.
[5471.92s -> 5472.42s]  Eat.
[5472.88s -> 5480.14s]  Where the hell am I?
[5480.14s -> 5481.66s]  See, I think you're good.
[5481.66s -> 5485.34s]  A rockstar dev definitely just was like, the cycle ends here and is disconnected.
[5486.38s -> 5489.18s]  He ripped out all the cords and then everybody now has to start fresh.
[5489.98s -> 5499.12s]  There's my horse.
[5499.84s -> 5501.36s]  I want to go back over to that mission.
[5504.16s -> 5505.44s]  Where the hell am I?
[5505.44s -> 5506.24s]  Eats grass.
[5506.24s -> 5507.68s]  Well, what if I was hungry?
[5510.60s -> 5511.32s]  All right, Sean.
[5512.46s -> 5512.96s]  Let's go.
[5515.26s -> 5518.30s]  What was that?
[5520.67s -> 5522.03s]  Oh, I thought it was a player.
[5522.03s -> 5522.59s]  It was a player.
[5522.59s -> 5523.15s]  I just saw a name.
[5529.48s -> 5530.36s]  There was a name there.
[5530.36s -> 5531.16s]  That's the crocodile.
[5531.88s -> 5534.01s]  The fuck is talking?
[5543.71s -> 5544.67s]  Oh, that's me going.
[5544.67s -> 5545.17s]  Yeah.
[5545.79s -> 5550.56s]  All right, so I'm gonna be a good guy.
[5563.48s -> 5566.60s]  Why am I having, I'm an unintentional bully.
[5566.60s -> 5567.88s]  I don't mean to do that.
[5569.66s -> 5571.02s]  I don't, I didn't want to do that.
[5571.66s -> 5581.58s]  No, this is nice.
[5581.58s -> 5582.86s]  I like how this town is lit up at night.
[5583.58s -> 5589.20s]  All right, so we got, we got the barbershop.
[5595.74s -> 5597.02s]  Uh, what do you think?
[5597.02s -> 5597.98s]  I'll tell you what I think.
[5597.98s -> 5598.48s]  Let's see.
[5601.12s -> 5602.24s]  Nice haircut.
[5602.24s -> 5605.64s]  Is this your horse?
[5606.36s -> 5608.86s]  What is your horse?
[5614.17s -> 5615.13s]  Don't crash the server.
[5615.13s -> 5616.81s]  You're gonna crash the server.
[5616.81s -> 5623.39s]  The cycle, the cycle never ends.
[5624.48s -> 5627.36s]  I told you guys, that person did the same thing I did.
[5628.08s -> 5629.44s]  The same exact thing.
[5630.49s -> 5631.85s]  And it starts over again.
[5632.65s -> 5634.09s]  Rockstar, unplug it again.
[5634.09s -> 5635.53s]  We need to start over.
[5635.53s -> 5647.61s]  And I will continue to restart and reimagine and originate the human species until you learn.
[5648.86s -> 5649.90s]  Get along.
[5649.90s -> 5652.94s]  That's what we don't, we're in like a fucking weird post-apocalyptic movie.
[5660.41s -> 5660.97s]  Where's my horse?
[5660.97s -> 5663.13s]  Can my horse be stolen or taken or killed or something?
[5663.77s -> 5668.28s]  I think they're coming after me.
[5668.28s -> 5672.22s]  This person, look, this person's just murdering people.
[5672.22s -> 5674.86s]  See, I did it once and broke the server.
[5674.86s -> 5677.42s]  But now it's time to get a little bit of revenge here, I think.
[5678.54s -> 5683.13s]  The cycle repeats, the cycle repeats, the cycle repeats.
[5703.77s -> 5704.65s]  All right, I got my revenge.
[5704.65s -> 5705.21s]  I gotta get out of here.
[5710.35s -> 5713.71s]  It's time to go do a mission with a bunch of friends.
[5716.73s -> 5725.68s]  Okay, so this guy right here.
[5729.61s -> 5731.21s]  Except caravan escort.
[5731.53s -> 5734.01s]  Thinks he's some criminal mastermind these days.
[5734.97s -> 5737.45s]  This is the last thing I need right now.
[5737.45s -> 5738.89s]  Voice chat, how do I turn off voice chat?
[5740.89s -> 5746.70s]  I'm guessing this ain't just a social call.
[5746.70s -> 5747.26s]  Showdown.
[5748.22s -> 5753.96s]  What are you ringing a bell?
[5754.92s -> 5755.96s]  It's in the player menu.
[5757.32s -> 5759.61s]  Who's ringing the thing?
[5761.28s -> 5762.24s]  That's not the player menu.
[5763.98s -> 5767.26s]  So am I right in thinking you're here for more of all the little masters?
[5767.26s -> 5768.94s]  Online options, voice chat.
[5770.75s -> 5771.47s]  No one.
[5771.87s -> 5772.75s]  Friends only.
[5774.52s -> 5775.32s]  Walk styles.
[5776.36s -> 5776.76s]  Crazy.
[5779.52s -> 5780.48s]  All right, now we're good.
[5784.30s -> 5786.94s]  Another one here for some money under the table, I assume.
[5786.94s -> 5788.84s]  I'll take it.
[5788.84s -> 5791.24s]  Nope, got nothing for you, sunshine.
[5791.24s -> 5791.64s]  No, what?
[5791.64s -> 5792.92s]  Oh, I'm so bored.
[5793.80s -> 5795.80s]  It's like being trapped in a picture frame.
[5795.80s -> 5798.12s]  Increase your chance at success by accepting free roam missions.
[5798.12s -> 5799.08s]  They dropped off a note.
[5799.08s -> 5800.68s]  Some job that needs doing.
[5801.40s -> 5804.52s]  Whoever they are, not that I give a damn anymore.
[5805.08s -> 5806.44s]  Oh, I'm so bored.
[5807.32s -> 5808.60s]  It's like being trapped in a picture frame.
[5808.60s -> 5809.64s]  So I'm not allowed to do this?
[5809.64s -> 5810.44s]  I'm not cool enough?
[5810.44s -> 5811.24s]  I don't have a big enough...
[5811.24s -> 5812.60s]  They dropped off a note.
[5812.60s -> 5814.20s]  Some job that needs doing.
[5814.92s -> 5818.36s]  Whoever they are, not that I give a damn anymore.
[5818.36s -> 5820.12s]  I need some people online.
[5821.79s -> 5823.15s]  Accept Supply Wagon.
[5823.87s -> 5825.07s]  What is he doing?
[5827.72s -> 5828.36s]  Oh, okay.
[5832.19s -> 5833.07s]  I'm not big enough.
[5834.60s -> 5835.00s]  All right.
[5835.64s -> 5838.20s]  Does this mean that other people are going to be in this game?
[5839.00s -> 5847.23s]  Deliver the supplies to Rhodes General Store.
[5848.19s -> 5854.00s]  Take the supplies to the drop-off within the time limit to earn the full reward.
[5854.00s -> 5855.60s]  So people are going to sabotage me here.
[5856.80s -> 5857.60s]  I just got to go.
[5857.60s -> 5859.04s]  Maybe people aren't paying that much attention.
[5859.84s -> 5869.02s]  I just got to bring the wagon.
[5869.74s -> 5874.75s]  And if anybody comes near me, rival players can attack the supplies.
[5877.40s -> 5877.80s]  Right.
[5877.80s -> 5879.08s]  No, this is great.
[5879.08s -> 5879.32s]  Okay.
[5879.32s -> 5881.48s]  Well, I know what you're doing down there.
[5882.62s -> 5884.22s]  You just got the little pop-up window.
[5885.10s -> 5888.91s]  Jerma is delivering supplies.
[5889.71s -> 5894.14s]  You should probably stomp him.
[5894.14s -> 5896.68s]  Maybe they're too preoccupied.
[5899.23s -> 5906.73s]  Maybe I'll just get this without any issue at all and I'll get the full one gold bar reward.
[5907.69s -> 5913.64s]  Hey, this is great.
[5913.64s -> 5914.12s]  Look at this.
[5916.01s -> 5918.70s]  I just get to drive it for free.
[5919.66s -> 5920.94s]  No one's going to stop me.
[5920.94s -> 5921.82s]  No one can stop me.
[5931.60s -> 5932.08s]  I've won.
[5932.64s -> 5939.45s]  Am I even in a game with anybody anymore?
[5940.01s -> 5947.05s]  What?
[5947.05s -> 5963.24s]  What can I shoot?
[5964.04s -> 5964.44s]  Shoot him.
[5965.32s -> 5965.96s]  Shoot the gun.
[5965.96s -> 5967.08s]  What are you fucking doing?
[5968.12s -> 5968.60s]  What?
[5969.96s -> 5971.00s]  I can't shoot that way.
[5971.80s -> 5972.84s]  I can't shoot the gun that way.
[5975.50s -> 5976.70s]  This is not a player.
[5976.70s -> 5980.22s]  Yeah, it's because they probably all get disconnected.
[5987.82s -> 5990.40s]  I need to run.
[5991.52s -> 5992.16s]  I am running.
[5992.96s -> 5996.54s]  There ain't nobody here to stop me.
[5997.34s -> 6002.03s]  I just get whatever I get from completing this.
[6004.96s -> 6006.32s]  I think maybe the servers went down to get it.
[6006.32s -> 6007.76s]  Now I just get all the spoils.
[6008.32s -> 6014.40s]  What's against this camera angle?
[6014.40s -> 6020.40s]  Are the servers really that dead?
[6022.73s -> 6023.45s]  They shouldn't be.
[6024.25s -> 6032.11s]  I'm in an empty server.
[6032.11s -> 6033.31s]  Well, I'll go to a new one.
[6034.67s -> 6036.99s]  After I get the full reward.
[6036.99s -> 6041.76s]  Uh-oh, somebody's coming in.
[6053.40s -> 6054.92s]  Wait, am I about to drive right into somebody?
[6054.92s -> 6055.64s]  I gotta be ready for this.
[6056.60s -> 6062.03s]  Are they going to come straight down the road?
[6069.82s -> 6070.78s]  How far away are they?
[6071.42s -> 6072.91s]  I got it.
[6072.91s -> 6073.71s]  It's right here.
[6077.12s -> 6079.28s]  Enemies can't interact with me when I'm in the drop-off area.
[6079.28s -> 6080.16s]  All right, we'll get over there.
[6087.77s -> 6089.53s]  Red Dead Redemption online.
[6090.41s -> 6091.53s]  It's awesome.
[6092.25s -> 6100.57s]  It's like a one cent.
[6102.60s -> 6105.56s]  Wow, that was exhilarating.
[6106.20s -> 6115.93s]  Well, here's my experience of the Red Dead 2 online so far.
[6118.32s -> 6119.20s]  Hello?
[6119.20s -> 6119.68s]  Hello?
[6121.92s -> 6124.30s]  Anybody here?
[6124.30s -> 6125.02s]  Anybody here?
[6125.02s -> 6125.90s]  Anybody here?
[6125.90s -> 6126.86s]  Anybody here?
[6126.86s -> 6129.48s]  What's going on here?
[6129.48s -> 6129.80s]  Somebody plug?
[6129.80s -> 6130.36s]  What's going on here?
[6130.36s -> 6130.60s]  Somebody plug?
[6130.60s -> 6131.16s]  What's going on here?
[6131.16s -> 6131.48s]  Somebody plug?
[6131.48s -> 6132.76s]  What's going on here?
[6132.76s -> 6149.28s]  All right, how do I join again?
[6149.28s -> 6150.72s]  I want to join like a different game.
[6151.36s -> 6156.64s]  All right, join free roam.
[6156.64s -> 6161.44s]  Be sure you want to join Red Dead online.
[6161.44s -> 6161.68s]  Yes.
[6162.72s -> 6164.32s]  Just get me in a different session.
[6176.89s -> 6177.93s]  Hopping dimensions.
[6178.57s -> 6182.14s]  I could do the story mission.
[6182.70s -> 6184.94s]  At least matchmaking would probably pull people in, right?
[6185.58s -> 6188.08s]  Remember when Next was an emote?
[6188.08s -> 6188.80s]  Oh yeah, I do.
[6190.46s -> 6191.50s]  Boy, that was a mistake.
[6204.84s -> 6205.32s]  Next.
[6206.12s -> 6206.52s]  God.
[6208.16s -> 6210.40s]  Immediately after uploading that, I was going...
[6211.90s -> 6213.90s]  I don't know if I should actually put this on.
[6213.90s -> 6215.58s]  And then I left it there for like a year.
[6216.22s -> 6223.64s]  Are we going to get the error code again?
[6227.90s -> 6228.70s]  No, we're not.
[6228.70s -> 6230.70s]  All right, so here we are.
[6246.94s -> 6247.90s]  There we go.
[6247.90s -> 6248.86s]  All right, we're good.
[6248.86s -> 6249.42s]  We're good.
[6249.42s -> 6249.98s]  We're...
[6249.98s -> 6250.46s]  They're here.
[6253.24s -> 6254.04s]  But where are they?
[6256.51s -> 6258.43s]  Okay, a lot of people are...
[6258.43s -> 6259.71s]  I'm just in like the shitty place.
[6261.88s -> 6262.60s]  There we go.
[6264.27s -> 6265.31s]  All right, let's just go.
[6265.31s -> 6266.27s]  We're going to go on a...
[6268.24s -> 6269.28s]  Now I'm excited.
[6269.28s -> 6270.00s]  Okay, let's do...
[6271.44s -> 6278.65s]  This is like Stranger's Fortnite.
[6279.29s -> 6283.37s]  German with a train.
[6283.37s -> 6284.89s]  Oh my God, he has headphones on.
[6284.89s -> 6285.61s]  He can't hear me.
[6288.56s -> 6289.20s]  The train.
[6293.10s -> 6295.26s]  Oh my God, he has headphones on.
[6295.26s -> 6296.06s]  I already did this one.
[6296.06s -> 6296.94s]  I don't want to do that one again.
[6297.82s -> 6304.27s]  Play horseshoes?
[6304.99s -> 6306.35s]  I could play horseshoes, couldn't I?
[6307.15s -> 6308.51s]  I want to be clear with other people.
[6309.76s -> 6310.64s]  Is this another one of those...
[6311.28s -> 6313.36s]  And you know somebody stops me missions.
[6321.23s -> 6322.43s]  Can you open your house?
[6322.43s -> 6333.07s]  All right, well, let's actually then...
[6333.07s -> 6333.95s]  Let's go here then.
[6334.81s -> 6336.57s]  Where is that yellow marker?
[6338.49s -> 6338.97s]  Over here.
[6339.69s -> 6342.17s]  Well, I just...
[6342.17s -> 6343.61s]  I think I'm going...
[6343.61s -> 6345.29s]  Does it tell you if you've been marked?
[6347.55s -> 6349.71s]  Another player has marked your direct location.
[6350.59s -> 6352.46s]  It might.
[6352.46s -> 6353.10s]  It probably does.
[6365.45s -> 6366.81s]  NPCs, don't worry about them.
[6367.29s -> 6367.93s]  Just leave them be.
[6368.89s -> 6376.99s]  Hey, Jeremy.
[6376.99s -> 6379.31s]  Your title says you're playing Red Dead 2 online.
[6379.31s -> 6380.51s]  Can you update the title?
[6380.51s -> 6381.95s]  I don't want people getting confused.
[6383.47s -> 6389.64s]  Do I have any items for the horse?
[6389.64s -> 6390.44s]  Here, eat an apple.
[6399.74s -> 6400.54s]  Mod that guy.
[6402.24s -> 6403.52s]  No, nobody's getting modded.
[6404.40s -> 6410.44s]  Is this...
[6410.44s -> 6411.24s]  Whose place is this?
[6413.56s -> 6414.36s]  Is this somebody's camp?
[6415.88s -> 6417.08s]  Whose camp is this?
[6417.08s -> 6417.88s]  I need to investigate.
[6417.88s -> 6418.20s]  Who's here?
[6418.20s -> 6418.76s]  Who lives here?
[6419.40s -> 6427.10s]  Can I do anything in this person's camp?
[6430.35s -> 6432.35s]  Well, the white flag is up, so I can't do anything.
[6435.21s -> 6435.69s]  Let's go.
[6440.73s -> 6442.09s]  Smash the guy's toilet.
[6448.68s -> 6449.64s]  Poop in his tent.
[6450.28s -> 6452.51s]  No, he has the white flag up.
[6452.51s -> 6454.75s]  I can't go to the bathroom on his fucking clothes.
[6455.55s -> 6458.38s]  It's far away.
[6459.58s -> 6463.68s]  Can I get there by going around the river bank?
[6463.68s -> 6465.60s]  Or do I have to actually go all the way back up here?
[6471.93s -> 6473.45s]  Put ants in his sleeping bag.
[6473.45s -> 6474.81s]  You guys are fucking cruel!
[6484.51s -> 6485.95s]  Ants in his sleeping bag!
[6486.67s -> 6494.59s]  I have to go all the way around.
[6496.17s -> 6500.43s]  This horse sucks.
[6500.99s -> 6502.59s]  They really want you to pay.
[6502.59s -> 6505.31s]  I'm so used to having my $20 horse from the main game.
[6506.51s -> 6511.74s]  I can't believe I actually have to go all the way around.
[6515.45s -> 6516.25s]  God damn it.
[6520.65s -> 6520.97s]  Shit.
[6521.53s -> 6531.32s]  I'm not even near his camp anymore.
[6534.65s -> 6535.45s]  Take the train.
[6536.25s -> 6541.95s]  Join a death match.
[6541.95s -> 6546.89s]  Is the train even actually available to take?
[6548.76s -> 6549.32s]  Oh, it is.
[6550.65s -> 6551.37s]  Fast travel.
[6551.37s -> 6552.17s]  Holy shit, it is.
[6552.17s -> 6555.05s]  All right, so I need to go from here to...
[6555.05s -> 6556.01s]  I need to go to Blackwater.
[6557.53s -> 6557.85s]  All right.
[6557.85s -> 6559.13s]  Well, I didn't even know you could do that.
[6559.93s -> 6562.97s]  I don't think that fast travel wouldn't really exist in a game like this,
[6562.97s -> 6565.53s]  but I guess you could take the subway in GTA Online, couldn't you?
[6566.65s -> 6573.40s]  Any plans of doing online with friends?
[6573.40s -> 6574.20s]  Oh, yeah.
[6574.20s -> 6574.68s]  Definitely.
[6576.40s -> 6577.76s]  Definitely, definitely, definitely.
[6578.56s -> 6579.92s]  But not everybody can play yet.
[6580.64s -> 6585.76s]  I did just want to check it out because it's currently only allowed.
[6585.76s -> 6588.41s]  What is that?
[6589.05s -> 6590.67s]  What is this?
[6592.70s -> 6593.18s]  Hideout.
[6595.84s -> 6596.32s]  Hideout?
[6597.60s -> 6598.68s]  Who's hideout?
[6599.32s -> 6599.82s]  What?
[6604.86s -> 6606.30s]  Like another player hideout?
[6606.94s -> 6612.14s]  Or is this just a random, hey look, a hideout and kill the enemies?
[6613.80s -> 6627.95s]  There's a lot of people here.
[6630.92s -> 6631.80s]  Place is on fire.
[6632.60s -> 6635.24s]  Oh my god, what is that?
[6635.24s -> 6635.56s]  What is that?
[6635.56s -> 6635.88s]  What is this?
[6635.88s -> 6636.52s]  What is that thing?
[6638.52s -> 6639.16s]  No, no!
[6639.16s -> 6639.80s]  Get away from me!
[6640.60s -> 6642.00s]  I don't have any gu-
[6654.01s -> 6654.65s]  Boss in there?
[6656.30s -> 6657.26s]  That's apparently the boss.
[6658.14s -> 6664.75s]  Oh, fuck.
[6664.75s -> 6665.47s]  Where is he?
[6665.47s -> 6665.79s]  Where is he?
[6665.79s -> 6666.99s]  Where, where, where, where, where, where, where?
[6667.95s -> 6676.43s]  He's over here.
[6676.43s -> 6686.62s]  They give you these little fucking BB guns to start the game.
[6687.50s -> 6694.14s]  I gotta get in there closer.
[6694.14s -> 6694.86s]  I gotta move up.
[6695.50s -> 6705.77s]  I'm gonna go down.
[6706.81s -> 6712.99s]  On this rock.
[6714.99s -> 6716.83s]  That guy, uh, in the front door.
[6723.16s -> 6724.28s]  That guy died somehow.
[6724.28s -> 6725.56s]  That guy killed himself somehow.
[6726.52s -> 6733.58s]  All right, let's get this up.
[6733.58s -> 6735.50s]  There's like one guy left up here.
[6735.50s -> 6737.50s]  And this is the guy with the big hat on inside.
[6740.20s -> 6742.60s]  How are you still alive after I blew up all those tanks?
[6743.56s -> 6747.82s]  Nice dodge.
[6748.22s -> 6749.50s]  All right, just show your head again, please.
[6750.46s -> 6759.47s]  This looks like a pretty good time waster.
[6762.64s -> 6765.92s]  I mean, it depends on how-
[6766.64s -> 6767.68s]  What the hell?
[6768.88s -> 6770.16s]  I gotta kill these guys too.
[6779.04s -> 6779.68s]  You're still alive.
[6789.39s -> 6795.64s]  All right.
[6796.44s -> 6798.94s]  Um, hideout clear.
[6800.22s -> 6801.90s]  Now I have to pick up everybody's body.
[6805.45s -> 6807.05s]  Red Dead Redemption 76.
[6807.61s -> 6809.87s]  Okay, I got rank five.
[6810.51s -> 6814.00s]  I unlocked, uh, I unlocked like a-
[6814.00s -> 6815.68s]  The spleen or a kidney or something.
[6816.24s -> 6817.44s]  Pump action shotgun.
[6818.40s -> 6819.44s]  And a military jacket.
[6823.29s -> 6824.65s]  Zero percent on story missions.
[6825.21s -> 6826.49s]  Leave the bodies as a warning.
[6826.49s -> 6828.01s]  I gotta loot at least some of these.
[6829.05s -> 6829.85s]  Speaking of loot.
[6831.00s -> 6832.68s]  I mean, there has to be something in here, right?
[6834.46s -> 6837.26s]  Why have a giant hideout boat if you're not gonna have anything there?
[6837.98s -> 6846.27s]  Now I'm looking for a ladder.
[6846.27s -> 6847.48s]  Can I climb this?
[6856.89s -> 6857.61s]  Loot the dog.
[6859.77s -> 6861.21s]  What do you think the dog has on him?
[6864.51s -> 6865.55s]  Nothing up here at all.
[6866.27s -> 6873.68s]  It's to lure in the ADHD streamers.
[6874.40s -> 6883.48s]  That's a nice hat.
[6883.48s -> 6885.88s]  Oh, there's a catapult.
[6885.88s -> 6888.92s]  If I pull that thing, it'll shoot a rock directly into that pole,
[6888.92s -> 6891.56s]  destroying the boat and killing me and anyone else that's on board.
[6892.44s -> 6893.02s]  It's okay.
[6893.02s -> 6894.86s]  Like a hundred more years, uh, they'll figure it out.
[6895.58s -> 6897.58s]  Well, a hundred years in the past, they figured it out.
[6897.58s -> 6899.18s]  I don't know why we'd screw it up like this.
[6900.22s -> 6901.47s]  Nothing here.
[6913.39s -> 6917.07s]  I'm gonna be honest, uh, what the hell was that all about?
[6917.79s -> 6919.31s]  Can you give me a cool boat to explore?
[6919.31s -> 6922.27s]  And it's just the shitty catapult that doesn't work.
[6922.91s -> 6924.56s]  We spoke so soon.
[6925.12s -> 6925.60s]  Here it is.
[6929.08s -> 6930.04s]  No, never mind.
[6930.04s -> 6931.16s]  This is just explosives.
[6931.88s -> 6936.24s]  Come on, there's nothing in the red Acme chest.
[6937.04s -> 6938.16s]  Like the Road Runner chest.
[6938.16s -> 6939.04s]  There's nothing over here.
[6939.68s -> 6948.17s]  There's not a backpack that has a propeller on it that I can use.
[6948.97s -> 6953.58s]  Fuck it.
[6953.58s -> 6954.78s]  Let's just keep going.
[6954.78s -> 6960.76s]  I mean, that was kind of cool.
[6963.00s -> 6965.88s]  All right, back to the mission we were doing.
[6966.68s -> 6969.26s]  I don't know what my horse is.
[6969.82s -> 6975.10s]  I think I'm being followed.
[6975.10s -> 6991.42s]  I'm being followed.
[6991.98s -> 6996.78s]  There they are.
[6996.78s -> 6997.10s]  They're there.
[6997.10s -> 6997.58s]  They're on the horse.
[7006.92s -> 7007.72s]  Are you following me?
[7007.72s -> 7008.20s]  What are you doing?
[7008.84s -> 7012.76s]  They're riding around in circles over there.
[7025.36s -> 7026.08s]  I'm ready.
[7026.08s -> 7027.04s]  I'm prepared.
[7027.04s -> 7031.90s]  Hey, how about, hey, I don't know if you can hear me.
[7031.90s -> 7063.29s]  How about, uh, server's just high noon to me.
[7068.86s -> 7069.90s]  Oh, he heard me.
[7069.90s -> 7070.30s]  All right.
[7070.30s -> 7076.86s]  Yeah, you were saying.
[7077.42s -> 7081.50s]  See, stop killing each other.
[7081.50s -> 7082.54s]  Don't you understand?
[7082.54s -> 7084.48s]  The guy at Rockstar that's ripping it out.
[7084.48s -> 7086.40s]  The like Thanos Rockstar guy.
[7088.11s -> 7089.23s]  No, somebody in town.
[7092.22s -> 7093.42s]  Screamed a bunch of swears
[7093.42s -> 7095.26s]  and then threw a grenade into the barbershop.
[7095.26s -> 7096.57s]  Rip it out.
[7096.57s -> 7097.53s]  Start over.
[7097.53s -> 7115.87s]  Okay, I'm back.
[7115.87s -> 7122.32s]  And, well, you gave up.
[7122.32s -> 7123.68s]  All right, so let, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7123.68s -> 7125.36s]  Well, we're going here.
[7125.36s -> 7134.17s]  I mean, let's give Rockstar a little bit of slack.
[7134.17s -> 7136.73s]  There are probably two to three hundred million people
[7138.36s -> 7141.39s]  all trying to connect at the same time.
[7153.00s -> 7154.44s]  Two to three hundred, you mean.
[7155.00s -> 7156.88s]  Did I say million?
[7156.88s -> 7157.92s]  Did I add the million?
[7157.92s -> 7159.36s]  I think I added the million.
[7159.36s -> 7163.61s]  I meant, I meant, I meant that in yen.
[7164.09s -> 7166.49s]  Two to three hundred million yen people.
[7166.49s -> 7168.57s]  Which is like, what, two thousand?
[7169.21s -> 7199.32s]  All right, let's fast travel over there.
[7199.32s -> 7201.48s]  And are we actually in a game with people?
[7201.48s -> 7203.08s]  Let me make sure.
[7204.46s -> 7205.02s]  Yes, we are.
[7205.66s -> 7212.36s]  Two hundred million yen is 1.7 million.
[7212.36s -> 7214.12s]  Yeah, so that's 1.7 million people
[7214.12s -> 7215.40s]  probably trying to play at the same time.
[7218.72s -> 7219.28s]  Fast travel.
[7223.74s -> 7224.14s]  Let's see.
[7224.14s -> 7224.94s]  How much does it cost?
[7226.49s -> 7231.74s]  Oh, man, that's, that's, that's like 30 percent,
[7231.74s -> 7234.06s]  33 percent of my entire savings.
[7234.78s -> 7243.90s]  I just dumped my 401k out
[7244.46s -> 7246.91s]  to be able to take a taxi.
[7258.09s -> 7258.97s]  Start riding.
[7264.12s -> 7281.34s]  Let's try these for now.
[7284.19s -> 7286.27s]  Beat against up to 32 players
[7286.27s -> 7288.83s]  across large maps in a series of thrilling game types.
[7289.63s -> 7297.02s]  Walk straight into a race and kick up some dust on horseback.
[7297.82s -> 7299.84s]  Yeah, I want to try a race.
[7306.75s -> 7307.87s]  And then we'll go, we'll try.
[7307.87s -> 7312.12s]  Maybe they're just doing Thanos maintenance to it.
[7312.68s -> 7322.67s]  It's not a 2018 multiplayer game without Battle Royale.
[7323.39s -> 7330.19s]  Why don't I ever juggle on stream anymore?
[7332.65s -> 7333.77s]  I don't know how to juggle.
[7344.73s -> 7345.29s]  Same.
[7345.29s -> 7347.05s]  Yeah, I don't know how to show.
[7347.05s -> 7347.93s]  I don't know how to juggle.
[7348.81s -> 7353.63s]  But why don't I do it anymore?
[7354.27s -> 7355.15s]  Because I don't know how.
[7355.87s -> 7363.66s]  What am I looking at here?
[7363.66s -> 7367.24s]  Do you wish to spectate this session?
[7368.40s -> 7370.22s]  Um, okay.
[7371.10s -> 7375.26s]  Oh, this is a really bad race we're watching.
[7377.21s -> 7378.57s]  Oh, they crashed.
[7378.65s -> 7379.85s]  A wagon just crashed.
[7380.81s -> 7386.76s]  What's the next one?
[7401.69s -> 7402.01s]  Okay.
[7404.32s -> 7405.92s]  Oh, there's the other two people.
[7406.88s -> 7409.32s]  You have to pick up Donkey Kong barrels.
[7409.96s -> 7413.37s]  This guy's shooting.
[7413.37s -> 7414.09s]  Isn't that illegal?
[7418.33s -> 7419.69s]  I thought, I thought that was illegal.
[7419.69s -> 7420.89s]  I thought you couldn't use weapons.
[7421.61s -> 7428.76s]  Who's on the other list?
[7430.24s -> 7431.36s]  Somebody in the train?
[7436.30s -> 7440.54s]  That's a quick way to win a race is to drive the train there.
[7446.25s -> 7447.77s]  38 people to start this.
[7448.49s -> 7455.80s]  Well, this guy is, I want the person in like, first place.
[7456.68s -> 7465.74s]  Oh god, he's got headphones on.
[7466.38s -> 7468.16s]  So this is the person in second place.
[7468.16s -> 7469.36s]  Here's the guy in first place.
[7470.08s -> 7471.15s]  Okay.
[7471.79s -> 7473.47s]  Let's see how he does.
[7474.70s -> 7475.18s]  Good luck.
[7475.18s -> 7476.94s]  I hope you, no, you're in sixth.
[7477.66s -> 7482.78s]  Why can I, wait, this guy's not in first place.
[7482.78s -> 7483.74s]  I just went backwards.
[7495.55s -> 7496.43s]  Did you just win?
[7496.99s -> 7497.87s]  That person just won.
[7498.67s -> 7501.87s]  They were so hell bent on shooting the other person that they lost.
[7502.67s -> 7504.92s]  Yeah, here comes Sam.
[7504.92s -> 7505.56s]  All right, let's go.
[7507.44s -> 7507.92s]  My turn.
[7508.48s -> 7520.62s]  So is this just like in GTA online where
[7521.50s -> 7524.22s]  in the first one second of it going three, two, one,
[7525.02s -> 7527.34s]  14 people crash into each other and fall off the horses
[7527.34s -> 7529.10s]  and then somebody accidentally gets in first place
[7529.10s -> 7530.78s]  and they stay in first place the rest of the time.
[7533.48s -> 7537.50s]  This guy's not even doing the race anymore.
[7545.18s -> 7545.90s]  First place.
[7550.40s -> 7551.68s]  I'll take my reward, please.
[7552.24s -> 7552.72s]  Thank you.
[7565.71s -> 7569.48s]  What?
[7569.48s -> 7571.16s]  Okay, uh, proceed.
[7574.54s -> 7575.02s]  Stable.
[7575.66s -> 7578.30s]  I'll be riding with Sean who sucks.
[7579.02s -> 7580.06s]  Game details.
[7580.06s -> 7582.54s]  Yep, I'm, I'm ready.
[7582.54s -> 7583.02s]  Ready up.
[7591.61s -> 7592.33s]  Change outfit.
[7592.33s -> 7593.29s]  I don't have any outfits.
[7594.09s -> 7599.53s]  What a wind down different if I didn't get-
[7599.53s -> 7600.65s]  Hey, oh, I turned off.
[7600.65s -> 7601.45s]  I turned this off.
[7607.24s -> 7608.12s]  Didn't I do that?
[7608.12s -> 7609.08s]  Did I turn that off?
[7610.17s -> 7612.17s]  All right, we just gotta just pretend we're not here.
[7628.46s -> 7629.18s]  All right, let's do it.
[7629.74s -> 7631.90s]  Bards crossing, point to point, race across, bards crossing.
[7632.70s -> 7633.52s]  I'm ready.
[7633.52s -> 7638.70s]  Now, heated gaming moment inbound.
[7640.89s -> 7641.21s]  Yep.
[7645.87s -> 7648.99s]  Three, two, one, go.
[7649.71s -> 7657.21s]  That's me.
[7664.19s -> 7666.19s]  Three, two, one.
[7666.19s -> 7667.07s]  Why am I all the way in the back?
[7667.07s -> 7667.63s]  That's not fair.
[7668.43s -> 7675.36s]  I'm gonna get in that first place position.
[7676.48s -> 7678.94s]  I'm at least gonna start in like the top.
[7678.94s -> 7680.22s]  I gotta finish in the-
[7681.26s -> 7682.30s]  It really is Mario Kart.
[7683.02s -> 7684.28s]  I just got a gun.
[7684.92s -> 7687.39s]  In the first place.
[7687.39s -> 7699.34s]  How do I punch?
[7701.85s -> 7702.17s]  What?
[7702.89s -> 7704.73s]  Oh my god, you have so much health.
[7705.53s -> 7710.92s]  That's not what I thought it was gonna be.
[7711.64s -> 7715.88s]  My horse, I gotta be careful.
[7716.28s -> 7716.76s]  Slow down.
[7717.48s -> 7718.28s]  Let the horse breathe.
[7731.77s -> 7732.65s]  Why did I die?
[7733.69s -> 7744.72s]  Whose horse is that?
[7744.72s -> 7745.92s]  Why is it in the way?
[7745.92s -> 7746.16s]  What?
[7753.84s -> 7755.36s]  What's the fucking spawning horse?
[7756.16s -> 7757.79s]  Was that my horse?
[7764.60s -> 7766.28s]  This is wild horses running around.
[7766.84s -> 7769.42s]  Okay, I need something.
[7769.42s -> 7772.40s]  I don't know what it is.
[7772.40s -> 7774.81s]  God, nothing.
[7774.81s -> 7778.48s]  I'm in the last place right now.
[7778.48s -> 7779.28s]  But that wasn't my fault.
[7779.28s -> 7780.40s]  I got a horse spawn.
[7780.96s -> 7782.72s]  Somebody dropped a horse banana peel on me.
[7783.52s -> 7784.32s]  That wasn't fair.
[7785.20s -> 7793.16s]  Oh, you gotta collect a barrel to replenish the stamina.
[7798.11s -> 7798.35s]  What?
[7812.00s -> 7813.84s]  Does he like tap my foot and I died?
[7814.64s -> 7822.19s]  Three green shells.
[7822.19s -> 7823.79s]  All right, this is where I'm gonna get the lightning bolt.
[7824.59s -> 7826.03s]  See, it really is the lightning bolt.
[7827.82s -> 7829.66s]  I actually just picked up a lightning bolt.
[7829.66s -> 7833.00s]  All right, now I got a shotgun.
[7833.72s -> 7838.06s]  I just shrunk everybody by like 60%.
[7838.06s -> 7838.46s]  I'm good.
[7841.29s -> 7842.33s]  Not in the last place anymore.
[7842.89s -> 7856.01s]  That person's gone.
[7856.01s -> 7857.29s]  That person's off the track completely.
[7857.29s -> 7858.41s]  I gotta get in eighth place here.
[7861.58s -> 7861.98s]  What?
[7861.98s -> 7866.89s]  Is he phased in?
[7866.89s -> 7868.38s]  I don't understand.
[7868.38s -> 7869.18s]  He just phased in.
[7878.68s -> 7880.28s]  How come he doesn't go off?
[7880.28s -> 7881.48s]  Why does he not go off?
[7882.20s -> 7883.24s]  Why does he?
[7883.24s -> 7885.24s]  Why does he not get affected by that?
[7885.80s -> 7886.92s]  That was ridiculous.
[7893.66s -> 7898.06s]  I get fucking tapped on the toe and I flip off and die.
[7899.42s -> 7902.06s]  My horse spins around in a circle a hundred miles per hour.
[7902.06s -> 7909.34s]  And what the fuck is happening?
[7909.90s -> 7913.50s]  Hey, I didn't come in last.
[7914.22s -> 7919.02s]  You can just finish line.
[7931.82s -> 7933.26s]  I can't come in last place.
[7934.14s -> 7934.92s]  It's all right.
[7934.92s -> 7937.08s]  The guy that isn't last place right now gave up.
[7946.94s -> 7947.74s]  What was that?
[7948.46s -> 7952.59s]  That was absolute dog shit.
[7953.23s -> 7957.32s]  The NF is worse than last place.
[7957.32s -> 7957.80s]  No, it's not.
[7957.80s -> 7959.00s]  That means that I still tried.
[7959.72s -> 7969.53s]  That guy killed me so I couldn't finish.
[7969.53s -> 7970.25s]  What a dick.
[7970.25s -> 7973.69s]  Yeah, that's also the guy that ran through
[7973.69s -> 7975.85s]  mud, concrete, and like four explosions.
[7976.49s -> 7978.01s]  And he was completely fine.
[7978.41s -> 7978.97s]  Scratch on him.
[7989.13s -> 7989.69s]  Purchases.
[7990.33s -> 7990.97s]  All ammo.
[7992.84s -> 7993.40s]  Arrows.
[7995.08s -> 7996.28s]  I don't want this.
[7996.28s -> 8000.28s]  We've got 14 people.
[8000.28s -> 8001.56s]  Let's try this again.
[8001.56s -> 8002.84s]  I have to try this again.
[8002.84s -> 8003.24s]  I have to.
[8010.28s -> 8010.92s]  What the hell?
[8013.26s -> 8014.46s]  Mario Kart guns.
[8015.18s -> 8024.51s]  How do you turn off GTA mode?
[8024.51s -> 8025.31s]  I'm not sure you can.
[8028.64s -> 8030.80s]  You're just going to get angry like a hitman.
[8030.80s -> 8031.52s]  No, no.
[8032.24s -> 8037.29s]  Is there actually a battle royale mode in the game?
[8037.29s -> 8038.09s]  We'll do it after this.
[8044.68s -> 8045.32s]  Yes, there is.
[8045.32s -> 8045.56s]  Okay.
[8047.37s -> 8049.93s]  One dollar horse versus a thousand dollar horse.
[8049.93s -> 8050.49s]  That's okay.
[8056.83s -> 8060.51s]  Ride through all the signal fires around Valentine in any order.
[8061.31s -> 8062.89s]  So that's odd.
[8064.60s -> 8066.04s]  You have to just touch every single one.
[8066.60s -> 8070.03s]  Am I enjoying it so far?
[8071.72s -> 8072.52s]  It's fun.
[8072.52s -> 8074.44s]  I can't really give you a true assessment of it though
[8074.44s -> 8076.76s]  because I feel like I have to try to do everything.
[8078.08s -> 8081.76s]  It still has the same annoying flaws from GTA Online
[8081.76s -> 8083.28s]  that have somehow poured it over here.
[8084.24s -> 8086.72s]  Huge loading screens between every single thing you do.
[8087.68s -> 8091.79s]  But besides that.
[8092.99s -> 8093.23s]  All right.
[8093.23s -> 8093.71s]  Here we go.
[8097.72s -> 8098.92s]  Melee combat is disabled.
[8099.56s -> 8101.84s]  So you can go in any order.
[8102.64s -> 8105.48s]  Why am I instantly losing?
[8107.88s -> 8109.96s]  Is my character suck?
[8110.60s -> 8116.06s]  I think my character just sucks.
[8122.83s -> 8124.11s]  What did I do that was so wrong there?
[8124.11s -> 8124.91s]  I like touched him.
[8131.37s -> 8132.25s]  Is it my horse?
[8132.97s -> 8140.51s]  He's too top heavy.
[8141.31s -> 8153.61s]  He's just killing me.
[8155.45s -> 8157.21s]  I have weights on my character.
[8159.55s -> 8160.99s]  I have extra pounds on.
[8161.63s -> 8162.35s]  It's not fair.
[8177.13s -> 8179.05s]  Why does it happen to me but not him?
[8179.05s -> 8180.41s]  Why does it happen to me but not him?
[8180.41s -> 8181.13s]  I'm gonna freak out.
[8184.91s -> 8186.03s]  Why does it happen to me?
[8186.67s -> 8187.71s]  Why does it only happen to me?
[8188.59s -> 8189.71s]  It's not, that's not fair.
[8191.55s -> 8192.03s]  Why?
[8204.08s -> 8204.88s]  I'm gonna calm down.
[8205.52s -> 8206.40s]  I have to calm down.
[8207.04s -> 8211.76s]  You have more momentum?
[8211.76s -> 8212.16s]  What?
[8212.16s -> 8214.80s]  You can't just drive into somebody and not get hurt.
[8221.76s -> 8223.04s]  I can't fucking believe it.
[8223.68s -> 8225.28s]  That is absolute bullshit.
[8226.08s -> 8227.28s]  I wonder if he's gonna touch me
[8227.28s -> 8229.36s]  and I'm going to springboard off of the horse.
[8233.72s -> 8234.84s]  Everybody's Donkey Kong
[8234.84s -> 8237.24s]  and I get to be fucking Toad or Koopa Troopa.
[8238.20s -> 8242.01s]  If that were me, I would have exploded.
[8242.01s -> 8243.05s]  I would have spun a hundred times.
[8251.04s -> 8252.24s]  I'm an NPC.
[8252.24s -> 8253.28s]  I've come to terms with it.
[8254.08s -> 8257.20s]  Everybody's playing the fun game
[8257.20s -> 8258.96s]  and I get to be the guy that's here.
[8258.96s -> 8260.64s]  The AI bot that just falls down.
[8262.91s -> 8273.45s]  Didn't fall off that time.
[8274.17s -> 8283.85s]  I only got three more.
[8283.85s -> 8285.29s]  Everyone's not paying attention though
[8285.29s -> 8287.45s]  so I might have a chance to at least score some points.
[8288.49s -> 8291.23s]  I'm gonna, I'm not gonna finish.
[8291.23s -> 8291.71s]  I'm not gonna finish.
[8292.59s -> 8299.13s]  The reason why I'm not finishing is because I,
[8300.09s -> 8302.97s]  I keep getting fucking destroyed on the horse.
[8307.20s -> 8309.20s]  People will run full blast into me
[8309.20s -> 8312.48s]  and just drive right through me like, like a ghost.
[8327.88s -> 8330.36s]  Their horses are better in heavier weight classes.
[8332.57s -> 8335.21s]  I really look like such a fucking imbecile.
[8335.93s -> 8338.20s]  I'm just such easy prey.
[8339.98s -> 8343.02s]  I'm, I'm the fucking kid that got this for Christmas.
[8346.40s -> 8347.68s]  All right, I'm, I'm out of here.
[8348.48s -> 8355.87s]  I'm out of here, but I can't quit.
[8357.95s -> 8359.07s]  Yes, I'm sure I want to exit.
[8368.40s -> 8370.00s]  You're a Christmas noob.
[8370.00s -> 8372.96s]  Guy comes in, not even leveling up his horse.
[8372.96s -> 8374.08s]  No armor and no nothing.
[8375.96s -> 8377.16s]  It just gets bullied.
[8377.88s -> 8379.76s]  All right, what were the other things?
[8379.76s -> 8382.17s]  What's the Battle Royale mode?
[8387.96s -> 8389.08s]  Is it Showdown series?
[8389.32s -> 8391.84s]  Which one is it?
[8391.84s -> 8395.39s]  Victory Royale.
[8395.39s -> 8410.35s]  That's so stupid.
[8411.07s -> 8415.52s]  He's doing Battle Royale with the P-shooters.
[8415.52s -> 8416.72s]  I just want to try.
[8417.44s -> 8425.08s]  Red Dead Mario Kart, Red Dead Fortnite.
[8425.80s -> 8434.89s]  Just abuse the auto aim.
[8435.61s -> 8440.30s]  I don't, auto aim is not really that apparent
[8440.30s -> 8441.74s]  in online to other players.
[8442.70s -> 8445.93s]  32 player Battle Royale.
[8446.57s -> 8449.95s]  Yeah, I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get a steak dinner,
[8449.95s -> 8450.75s]  whatever they call it.
[8451.39s -> 8452.83s]  I'm gonna get the fried chicken.
[8452.83s -> 8454.19s]  I'm gonna get the fried chicken.
[8469.61s -> 8470.57s]  All right, let's go.
[8470.57s -> 8471.29s]  What's the mode?
[8473.79s -> 8474.43s]  What's the briefing?
[8474.43s -> 8474.75s]  Let's see.
[8479.16s -> 8480.04s]  Name your weapon.
[8483.76s -> 8485.28s]  Brief roll where the trickier weapons
[8485.28s -> 8486.56s]  earn more points per kill.
[8488.68s -> 8490.20s]  What?
[8490.20s -> 8492.04s]  Tomahawks will kill players in a single hit.
[8493.64s -> 8497.07s]  Okay, kill every, dispatch opponents.
[8497.71s -> 8500.03s]  Are they on the minimap or is it just random people?
[8502.86s -> 8508.96s]  I hear noises.
[8508.96s -> 8520.32s]  There we go.
[8520.32s -> 8528.72s]  He doesn't know I'm behind him.
[8541.68s -> 8562.20s]  All right, whoa, whoa, guy up there.
[8562.20s -> 8563.08s]  Anybody Tomahawks?
[8563.80s -> 8576.92s]  There he is, somebody up on the rock.
[8579.39s -> 8580.59s]  Oh, there's an item up here.
[8580.59s -> 8581.39s]  There's a weapon up here.
[8581.39s -> 8582.51s]  This is probably gonna be, yep.
[8583.71s -> 8599.95s]  Give me that item.
[8599.95s -> 8601.55s]  Where's the, where's the, where's the sniper rifle?
[8608.35s -> 8611.12s]  Put it on, put it on.
[8611.12s -> 8615.64s]  Oh, you know how fast I can tap circle, buddy?
[8622.86s -> 8626.96s]  Oh, how do I use it?
[8627.52s -> 8630.28s]  R1, oh, I'm just a target up here.
[8642.68s -> 8654.92s]  Oh, Tomahawk, battery's low.
[8654.92s -> 8655.40s]  It's all right.
[8656.12s -> 8670.19s]  Don't you dare, don't you dare.
[8671.23s -> 8675.88s]  Oh, come on.
[8675.88s -> 8677.88s]  Oh, that's actually pissing me off.
[8677.88s -> 8679.56s]  That actually pisses me off.
[8679.56s -> 8680.52s]  I was doing really well.
[8682.38s -> 8683.34s]  Oh, come on.
[8683.98s -> 8690.97s]  I was doing, I was, I was had to a bit
[8690.97s -> 8692.25s]  in either first or second place.
[8699.00s -> 8699.72s]  Come on.
[8699.72s -> 8707.95s]  That was fun.
[8707.95s -> 8719.48s]  I was so proud of you.
[8720.04s -> 8721.24s]  Disconnected, charged a bit.
[8721.24s -> 8721.72s]  What are you talking about?
[8721.72s -> 8722.36s]  I just plugged it in.
[8723.40s -> 8724.97s]  That's not plugged in?
[8725.77s -> 8732.99s]  How am I not connected?
[8738.91s -> 8740.04s]  What are you talking about?
[8741.64s -> 8742.84s]  Why does this not understand
[8742.84s -> 8744.28s]  that my controller's plugged in?
[8749.56s -> 8749.88s]  Okay.
[8754.56s -> 8756.36s]  Am I connected?
[8757.42s -> 8757.98s]  All right, I am.
[8757.98s -> 8758.78s]  There we go.
[8758.78s -> 8763.79s]  I have to charge my charger.
[8767.45s -> 8769.13s]  I don't think I've been able to stay connected
[8769.77s -> 8774.11s]  for more than, what, 30 minutes?
[8774.75s -> 8785.31s]  Sometimes less.
[8785.87s -> 8788.84s]  Well, the people that are asking how the game is
[8788.84s -> 8790.28s]  and if it's any fun in multiplayer.
[8791.08s -> 8794.11s]  It, I mean, it seems like it is.
[8794.11s -> 8795.95s]  I sure would love to play it uninterrupted
[8795.95s -> 8796.99s]  for more than 30 minutes.
[8798.11s -> 8799.55s]  Kill all the players to rise up the leaderboard.
[8799.55s -> 8801.23s]  The higher you get, the more points you're worth.
[8802.03s -> 8802.51s]  That's cool.
[8803.39s -> 8809.36s]  Did I just join in a random game here?
[8811.92s -> 8812.64s]  Chest down there.
[8814.12s -> 8816.76s]  Why is this not just, what is this, a nuke?
[8828.33s -> 8832.22s]  I think I did it.
[8832.22s -> 8834.62s]  I think I got, I shot him in the head like five times.
[8842.65s -> 8843.85s]  That's probably so scary.
[8853.44s -> 8854.80s]  PS4 aim.
[8855.60s -> 8858.16s]  Well, I mean, it's, I wish this was on PC.
[8858.16s -> 8861.44s]  Fistful of Rags is one of my favorite shooters,
[8861.44s -> 8861.84s]  like ever.
[8864.56s -> 8866.64s]  And having this on PC and actually control it
[8866.64s -> 8868.64s]  with a mouse and keyboard at like 60 FPS,
[8868.64s -> 8869.92s]  I would, I would play this every day.
[8871.58s -> 8873.50s]  Yeah, um, okay, sweet.
[8874.54s -> 8876.04s]  Is that guy talking to me?
[8883.39s -> 8885.47s]  It's like, I feel like you guys in chat
[8885.47s -> 8886.27s]  have said that before.
[8886.27s -> 8888.19s]  Like, okay, yeah, whatever you say, dude.
[8888.19s -> 8894.06s]  I can't turn this off either.
[8894.70s -> 8895.10s]  Can I?
[8900.24s -> 8901.28s]  I can't turn it up.
[8901.28s -> 8904.12s]  It's only on every, why?
[8904.12s -> 8905.08s]  Rockstar, why?
[8908.01s -> 8909.05s]  Of all the things.
[8909.61s -> 8918.88s]  So hold on, I can actually use it in multiplayer?
[8918.88s -> 8919.60s]  That seems so odd.
[8930.00s -> 8932.81s]  Oh, you can't be doing this.
[8932.81s -> 8933.93s]  Can turn it off.
[8933.93s -> 8934.43s]  Okay.
[8944.43s -> 8945.15s]  Interesting.
[8945.15s -> 8945.71s]  Sorry, brother.
[8945.71s -> 8946.75s]  How'd you do you like that?
[8951.61s -> 8953.79s]  How do I turn it off?
[8954.43s -> 8962.17s]  I'm getting nasty.
[8962.17s -> 8964.89s]  Open voice chat is seriously just like,
[8964.89s -> 8967.21s]  it's such a distracting, annoying thing
[8967.21s -> 8968.09s]  in every video game.
[8974.04s -> 8979.13s]  It's like, welcome to the wild west.
[8979.93s -> 8983.61s]  You play as Arthur Morgan and his band of misfits.
[8984.65s -> 8985.37s]  What time is it?
[8986.25s -> 8986.81s]  Where are we?
[8988.91s -> 8989.55s]  Shut up, mom.
[8999.44s -> 9000.00s]  I think I lost.
[9000.72s -> 9002.89s]  It's going to explode.
[9009.76s -> 9010.88s]  Don't be rude to mom.
[9015.87s -> 9017.07s]  I died five times.
[9020.86s -> 9021.50s]  What?
[9021.50s -> 9043.63s]  All right, let's go.
[9049.93s -> 9050.73s]  MVP.
[9053.77s -> 9064.83s]  You're a band of outlaws,
[9064.83s -> 9067.87s]  fighting over a treasure chest on the train tracks.
[9067.87s -> 9068.43s]  Toot toot.
[9068.43s -> 9069.23s]  Oh, be careful.
[9074.64s -> 9074.96s]  Huh?
[9075.60s -> 9076.64s]  No, I love Cheez-Its.
[9077.28s -> 9091.74s]  I'm going to do the mission.
[9091.74s -> 9094.14s]  I'm going to do the mission.
[9104.06s -> 9105.02s]  He has headphones.
[9105.02s -> 9107.10s]  I only have one headphone in.
[9107.10s -> 9113.42s]  Look at all these players.
[9115.93s -> 9116.49s]  Where?
[9116.49s -> 9117.69s]  I need to go from here to there.
[9117.69s -> 9119.93s]  So I need to take the, didn't I already?
[9119.93s -> 9121.93s]  No, wait, does this take money from me?
[9121.93s -> 9123.37s]  How much money did I have before the game crashed?
[9126.19s -> 9127.39s]  If it took money from me when I did this,
[9127.39s -> 9128.75s]  I'm just bleeding money for no reason.
[9131.12s -> 9133.44s]  Go to the options menu to turn off voice chat.
[9133.44s -> 9134.00s]  I already did.
[9136.91s -> 9138.35s]  I mean, I already did that.
[9143.80s -> 9145.08s]  Honestly, you saw me do it.
[9145.72s -> 9146.52s]  You saw me do it.
[9148.86s -> 9149.34s]  I did it.
[9149.34s -> 9150.06s]  You watched me do it.
[9164.00s -> 9166.14s]  You saw me do it.
[9166.14s -> 9166.86s]  You saw me do it.
[9167.68s -> 9168.08s]  Right here.
[9172.41s -> 9174.88s]  But what, what?
[9174.88s -> 9175.12s]  Okay.
[9175.12s -> 9176.24s]  What is this here for then?
[9181.77s -> 9182.33s]  That menu.
[9183.82s -> 9186.62s]  Why don't, why not just put off there?
[9188.80s -> 9190.16s]  That's only for the instance.
[9192.09s -> 9196.01s]  Oh, oh, all right.
[9196.01s -> 9196.81s]  Give me the stagecoach.
[9202.41s -> 9204.80s]  Right here.
[9204.80s -> 9205.76s]  Same for GTA.
[9207.42s -> 9208.14s]  Yeah, what the heck?
[9216.88s -> 9217.76s]  All right.
[9217.76s -> 9221.37s]  I need to go to, where was it?
[9221.37s -> 9221.93s]  Blackwater.
[9224.65s -> 9225.29s]  Blackwater.
[9225.29s -> 9226.25s]  We got to go there.
[9226.97s -> 9231.23s]  And I'm going to do the story mission with some online friends.
[9232.03s -> 9235.18s]  And by the way, it did take the money from me.
[9235.18s -> 9242.68s]  It processed the transaction.
[9242.68s -> 9243.88s]  And it may have just did it again.
[9243.88s -> 9245.16s]  And it may have just crashed it again.
[9245.72s -> 9249.26s]  It's taking more money from me.
[9249.98s -> 9254.20s]  I put in the dollar 50 and I pressed Mountain Dew.
[9254.20s -> 9255.64s]  That didn't fucking work.
[9255.64s -> 9257.24s]  And then I put another dollar in.
[9257.24s -> 9258.20s]  It's a dollar 50.
[9258.20s -> 9259.24s]  Didn't fucking work again.
[9259.88s -> 9260.84s]  What am I supposed to do?
[9260.84s -> 9261.72s]  Go get a manager?
[9261.72s -> 9263.64s]  They don't even operate these things.
[9263.72s -> 9265.96s]  I got to call the number on the back of the vending machine?
[9266.84s -> 9267.88s]  No, you're just going to leave.
[9268.76s -> 9284.12s]  Why did you do it two times?
[9284.12s -> 9285.88s]  Because you were really thirsty and there was your only option.
[9285.88s -> 9287.64s]  You thought maybe you could put a little bit more money and it would work.
[9291.95s -> 9293.71s]  Oh, I wonder what just happened.
[9294.27s -> 9297.40s]  You've been disconnected from Reddit and I'll do to a fault on the services.
[9302.33s -> 9304.41s]  And now it's never ending.
[9304.41s -> 9306.57s]  It's going to put me somewhere that I was before.
[9307.21s -> 9309.05s]  So I'm going to never endingly try.
[9309.05s -> 9310.65s]  I'm just going to fucking walk there.
[9310.65s -> 9311.77s]  I'm just going to walk there.
[9311.77s -> 9314.41s]  I'm going to get on the horse and I'm just going to walk there myself.
[9315.29s -> 9318.33s]  Every time I try to get there quicker, it just deletes me from the game.
[9323.58s -> 9333.12s]  For real.
[9333.12s -> 9335.20s]  Stop purchasing from the broken vending machine.
[9335.92s -> 9337.92s]  Play something else.
[9339.45s -> 9341.69s]  I mean, I could, I want to play this though.
[9343.77s -> 9346.25s]  This would be really fun if I could just play it.
[9346.25s -> 9348.25s]  And I have been able to in small snippets.
[9349.88s -> 9350.84s]  I want to play this.
[9351.56s -> 9352.68s]  I want to play this game.
[9354.94s -> 9357.90s]  I want a Mountain Dew from this machine.
[9357.90s -> 9360.78s]  I don't want to see Yara Mist from the other machine.
[9360.78s -> 9362.14s]  Even if that machine works.
[9362.86s -> 9363.90s]  I want a Mountain Dew.
[9364.62s -> 9379.66s]  How far away am I?
[9379.66s -> 9380.06s]  Let's see.
[9383.34s -> 9383.98s]  No.
[9383.98s -> 9384.14s]  All right.
[9384.14s -> 9384.86s]  Would you look at that?
[9386.06s -> 9386.54s]  Okay.
[9386.54s -> 9389.02s]  Please go across the entire video game again.
[9389.02s -> 9389.74s]  Is there a boat here?
[9390.46s -> 9391.48s]  I'm getting on a boat.
[9392.36s -> 9395.08s]  Give me a boat.
[9397.15s -> 9399.55s]  I will paddle across the whole ocean.
[9399.55s -> 9404.59s]  You can just choose where to log in.
[9404.59s -> 9404.91s]  Really?
[9405.88s -> 9412.09s]  Well, let me just do something bad here.
[9418.28s -> 9419.16s]  Boat through the rain.
[9419.80s -> 9424.01s]  Let's see if I can get a boat.
[9425.12s -> 9425.92s]  This is really cool.
[9431.77s -> 9433.69s]  Mountain Dew tastes like pee and marijuana.
[9436.56s -> 9437.28s]  I don't think...
[9437.28s -> 9439.28s]  Why do you know what those two things combined taste like?
[9439.28s -> 9441.52s]  I mean, I can understand knowing what they both taste like.
[9442.24s -> 9442.48s]  Right?
[9443.12s -> 9446.24s]  But why do you know what they taste like together?
[9446.24s -> 9466.72s]  All right.
[9466.72s -> 9472.09s]  So I'm just going across...
[9472.09s -> 9474.33s]  I'm just going across the whole Atlantic Ocean.
[9475.37s -> 9478.70s]  Why would you know what marijuana tastes like?
[9481.02s -> 9481.50s]  You can eat it.
[9482.30s -> 9486.01s]  Well, you don't eat the leaf.
[9487.13s -> 9487.37s]  Leaf.
[9489.96s -> 9490.60s]  Boil it down.
[9491.48s -> 9492.52s]  Smash it up.
[9492.52s -> 9494.20s]  Put it in a food processor.
[9494.20s -> 9494.84s]  And bake it.
[9495.72s -> 9500.38s]  And you add like corn syrup and sprinkle like cinnamon on it.
[9500.38s -> 9505.84s]  And then put like gelatin in it and mold it up into little shapes.
[9505.84s -> 9507.60s]  And then you have an edible.
[9511.04s -> 9511.44s]  All right.
[9511.44s -> 9512.32s]  I need a boat.
[9512.32s -> 9515.20s]  There's got to be a boat lined up here for some random idiot like me.
[9516.16s -> 9516.40s]  Yep.
[9528.70s -> 9528.94s]  All right.
[9528.94s -> 9529.90s]  That was the first one.
[9531.04s -> 9531.92s]  That was the first one.
[9532.92s -> 9533.96s]  I'll take that loss there.
[9533.96s -> 9535.48s]  That's two hours and 40 minutes, by the way.
[9536.28s -> 9538.22s]  That's how long it took.
[9538.22s -> 9538.78s]  That's a record.
[9539.50s -> 9541.28s]  And there's no boat here.
[9543.28s -> 9544.48s]  Wildly unfortunate.
[9544.48s -> 9545.12s]  But what is that?
[9545.76s -> 9550.94s]  It's a bucket.
[9550.94s -> 9551.66s]  God damn it.
[9551.66s -> 9551.98s]  Give me...
[9551.98s -> 9553.66s]  There's got to be a boat somewhere here.
[9554.46s -> 9559.93s]  There's no just canoe or rowboat just on the shore.
[9559.93s -> 9560.81s]  So I can just do this.
[9561.77s -> 9567.80s]  There's another hideout over here.
[9567.80s -> 9568.60s]  Do you have a boat?
[9568.60s -> 9569.56s]  That's all I care about.
[9574.94s -> 9576.46s]  Just swim, forehead.
[9577.02s -> 9606.32s]  How far is it?
[9606.88s -> 9610.78s]  I'm not even crossing the right...
[9612.30s -> 9613.26s]  Right place.
[9615.02s -> 9616.54s]  I'm going across...
[9616.54s -> 9617.34s]  I'm swimming.
[9618.30s -> 9621.82s]  Let's just go across the English Channel rather than the Atlantic.
[9622.78s -> 9635.16s]  Hey, this is the way to build stamina.
[9635.16s -> 9635.72s]  That's for sure.
[9636.52s -> 9642.27s]  It's going to take longer to swim than ride your horse.
[9643.15s -> 9643.95s]  I know.
[9643.95s -> 9644.11s]  But...
[9644.75s -> 9645.23s]  And I didn't...
[9645.23s -> 9646.91s]  What did I even do here?
[9646.91s -> 9647.31s]  I just...
[9647.31s -> 9657.07s]  I would have already been there if I didn't get the stop blue screen error code X0X00021.
[9657.07s -> 9657.95s]  What the hell it was.
[9667.21s -> 9667.69s]  Options.
[9667.69s -> 9668.41s]  Press the options button.
[9668.41s -> 9669.85s]  Select online and go to free room.
[9669.85s -> 9671.61s]  And then West Elizabeth.
[9671.61s -> 9676.00s]  How do I select where I want to go?
[9676.00s -> 9676.40s]  Free room.
[9676.40s -> 9676.96s]  I'm right where it is.
[9677.77s -> 9678.25s]  Where it is.
[9678.25s -> 9678.73s]  There it is.
[9679.37s -> 9679.93s]  Thank you.
[9689.31s -> 9692.11s]  Just jump on each water droplet until you get there.
[9710.48s -> 9715.12s]  Wouldn't that mean that the rain is solid to a point where you can stand on it?
[9715.12s -> 9718.64s]  Which means it can carry and hold enough weight for you to stand on it.
[9719.20s -> 9725.21s]  Therefore, all life is wiped out because you're essentially dropping tiny little concrete
[9725.21s -> 9726.25s]  bricks on everything.
[9726.25s -> 9726.97s]  On every person.
[9726.97s -> 9727.53s]  On everything.
[9727.53s -> 9728.17s]  And every animal.
[9728.17s -> 9728.73s]  Every tree.
[9738.72s -> 9739.52s]  I guess so, yeah.
[9740.80s -> 9741.44s]  Like hail.
[9741.44s -> 9742.72s]  But you can't stand on hail.
[9744.14s -> 9750.89s]  If it was two pounds per pebble and hundreds of millions of them were falling at the
[9750.89s -> 9751.85s]  same time.
[9751.85s -> 9759.87s]  You would just turn everybody into a giant food processor.
[9759.87s -> 9761.71s]  We'd be inside the stomach of a turkey.
[9764.86s -> 9768.40s]  Turkeys eat rocks to digest all the food.
[9769.29s -> 9770.01s]  That's what would happen.
[9770.73s -> 9771.77s]  Well, we're already here.
[9772.33s -> 9772.89s]  We made it.
[9772.89s -> 9773.29s]  Finally.
[9774.17s -> 9775.05s]  We're in Blackwater.
[9780.20s -> 9780.84s]  What's this mean?
[9816.72s -> 9818.40s]  Why is he chasing after the wagon?
[9819.04s -> 9822.99s]  How do I whistle to him?
[9823.79s -> 9825.31s]  A rival posse has started the mission.
[9825.31s -> 9826.11s]  Eliminate the target!
[9826.11s -> 9838.16s]  Hey, slow down!
[9838.16s -> 9841.36s]  Is that, no, that's, that, this is me from the past.
[9842.08s -> 9864.28s]  Can I actually get him in this?
[9868.92s -> 9869.96s]  Oh my god.
[9872.86s -> 9873.36s]  What?
[9896.30s -> 9899.26s]  That was fucking funny.
[9899.82s -> 9905.74s]  Who the fuck are you?
[9906.30s -> 9907.10s]  Oh shit, it's you!
[9907.98s -> 9908.46s]  I got him!
[9909.10s -> 9910.14s]  It was lag.
[9910.14s -> 9911.02s]  A little bit of lag there.
[9925.20s -> 9927.04s]  So if you get somebody in the last oak,
[9927.04s -> 9929.92s]  and I like to hide them out, actually, like hog-tie them?
[9935.85s -> 9936.33s]  No.
[9936.33s -> 9939.13s]  So that's why, because that's what I've always taken so long to do.
[9946.32s -> 9947.04s]  What?
[9947.04s -> 9968.38s]  It's not fair.
[9968.38s -> 9970.30s]  There's like three people there as friends.
[9970.30s -> 9971.26s]  Where are my friends?
[9972.06s -> 9977.63s]  I'm just a random fucking farmer from down the road that heard noise outside of his house.
[9978.35s -> 9981.08s]  What's all that racket out here, you little bastards?
[10007.00s -> 10010.36s]  It's a four-band party.
[10010.36s -> 10011.48s]  One, two, three, four.
[10011.48s -> 10013.47s]  Me and my shitty horse.
[10013.47s -> 10029.20s]  And then this guy.
[10029.20s -> 10030.96s]  Sean is not a shitty horse.
[10030.96s -> 10031.76s]  All right, fuck this.
[10032.64s -> 10034.72s]  You want to see the real Red Dead Redemption?
[10036.41s -> 10039.69s]  Called Farmer Joe was going full speed into the fucking party of four.
[10040.49s -> 10052.04s]  That wasn't even one of them.
[10056.44s -> 10057.80s]  That wasn't even one of them.
[10057.80s -> 10060.52s]  And they, I fell off my horse, but they didn't.
[10061.16s -> 10062.20s]  Fucking typical.
[10062.20s -> 10063.00s]  My horse is dead.
[10090.09s -> 10091.53s]  Thank god for horse insurance.
[10098.46s -> 10099.66s]  Rockstar Online.
[10101.64s -> 10105.56s]  Just get in a party of four and bully the farmer that's level five.
[10106.20s -> 10111.37s]  I gotta like do something.
[10111.37s -> 10111.69s]  Fuck it.
[10111.69s -> 10112.81s]  I gotta fuck something up here.
[10120.89s -> 10121.69s]  Who the fuck is that?
[10122.65s -> 10123.05s]  We are friends.
[10123.05s -> 10123.61s]  We're friends, right?
[10123.61s -> 10124.01s]  We're friends.
[10124.01s -> 10124.41s]  We're friends.
[10124.41s -> 10125.05s]  We're friends, right?
[10125.05s -> 10125.85s]  You and I are friends.
[10126.49s -> 10127.58s]  Let me get on your horse.
[10127.58s -> 10128.38s]  We have to work together.
[10129.10s -> 10131.74s]  Don't you stand?
[10132.38s -> 10136.59s]  Hi, Sean.
[10136.59s -> 10146.80s]  Good luck doing anything with your old man hands.
[10146.80s -> 10149.20s]  All right, I don't want to go that way, but they're in the town too.
[10154.43s -> 10156.03s]  At least maybe the lawmen will come out.
[10156.67s -> 10161.23s]  Who is hanging out over here?
[10161.23s -> 10162.35s]  Oh god, he's on the road.
[10163.07s -> 10183.66s]  I got my revenge.
[10183.66s -> 10184.38s]  I don't even care.
[10188.35s -> 10189.55s]  I was trying to run him over.
[10190.19s -> 10199.90s]  Wait, that wasn't them?
[10200.46s -> 10204.30s]  That was the guy that had the star on his name, right?
[10205.02s -> 10221.32s]  What is this guy doing?
[10221.32s -> 10222.86s]  Are you friendly?
[10226.24s -> 10227.68s]  All right, hold on.
[10227.68s -> 10228.80s]  What's the emote?
[10228.80s -> 10232.70s]  How do you emote?
[10232.70s -> 10235.80s]  I'm trying to prove.
[10235.80s -> 10237.00s]  No, put the knife away.
[10239.44s -> 10239.76s]  Okay.
[10251.05s -> 10251.69s]  Okay.
[10251.69s -> 10254.60s]  He doesn't want to kill me.
[10254.60s -> 10275.56s]  Good.
[10275.56s -> 10281.20s]  It seems to start with the absolute most, the worst possible moments, right?
[10281.92s -> 10284.16s]  Oh, look, there's a guy there.
[10284.16s -> 10287.60s]  Are you going to maybe make a friend and go do some stuff?
[10287.60s -> 10290.32s]  Oh, you're doing really well in this online session where you're probably for...
[10290.32s -> 10291.44s]  No, no, no.
[10297.76s -> 10301.68s]  Yeah, only when I get fucking bullied is when they want to keep the servers on.
[10310.60s -> 10312.92s]  I've played 14 hours and have never gotten kicked.
[10314.92s -> 10315.88s]  I wonder why it's...
[10315.88s -> 10317.40s]  I mean, is this happening to anybody else?
[10323.16s -> 10325.00s]  Or is this just a...
[10325.00s -> 10326.20s]  Is this just a me problem?
[10326.84s -> 10331.24s]  Yeah, it's happening to you.
[10331.24s -> 10332.12s]  Yeah, me, me, me.
[10332.92s -> 10334.67s]  Rock it.
[10334.67s -> 10335.55s]  All right, come on.
[10336.43s -> 10337.87s]  I want to play this.
[10337.87s -> 10339.07s]  I just got two in a row.
[10340.12s -> 10342.28s]  I got the one with the two and now I got one with the nine.
[10343.16s -> 10345.05s]  Now it won't even let me exit the game.
[10350.33s -> 10350.89s]  I'm gonna...
[10350.89s -> 10351.37s]  I'm gonna...
[10351.37s -> 10352.49s]  Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[10352.49s -> 10353.37s]  Let me go take a piss.
[10354.25s -> 10354.97s]  I'll be right back.
[10354.97s -> 10356.65s]  I'm gonna exit, restart.
[10356.65s -> 10357.61s]  We'll try it one more time.
[10360.24s -> 10361.20s]  I want to play this.
[10361.76s -> 10364.28s]  This is what I want to play, but I can't do it.
[10365.00s -> 10366.68s]  Well, I can, but just for not very long.
[10368.51s -> 10369.55s]  Give me one second.
[10369.55s -> 10370.99s]  I'm gonna grab another water and take a piss.
[10371.63s -> 10372.97s]  See you soon.
[10372.97s -> 10576.33s]  I can't open it.
[10576.33s -> 10577.37s]  I'm not strong enough to open this.
[10579.82s -> 10580.46s]  What the fuck?
[10582.16s -> 10583.04s]  God damn it.
[10584.62s -> 10585.18s]  Okay, I got it.
[10587.95s -> 10588.67s]  Mountain Dew.
[10589.39s -> 10596.04s]  Let's go back into this.
[10596.04s -> 10596.52s]  Try it again.
[10602.16s -> 10603.04s]  All right.
[10603.04s -> 10603.92s]  I'm gonna restart it.
[10607.56s -> 10608.84s]  I shouldn't have to do this.
[10609.80s -> 10610.68s]  Rock star.
[10611.48s -> 10620.83s]  I'll fuck some people up online.
[10620.83s -> 10621.55s]  I'm trying.
[10622.19s -> 10627.50s]  I'm trying to get it done.
[10633.45s -> 10635.37s]  Please drink verification.
[10635.37s -> 10635.87s]  What?
[10641.00s -> 10641.80s]  All right, here we go.
[10641.80s -> 10642.30s]  Let's go.
[10653.05s -> 10653.93s]  Oh, it's from...
[10653.93s -> 10654.81s]  It's from meme.
[10656.17s -> 10657.05s]  I see.
[10657.05s -> 10657.61s]  I get it.
[10658.33s -> 10659.77s]  Well, actually, I don't get it.
[10660.41s -> 10662.01s]  I don't know what you mean by that.
[10662.81s -> 10664.97s]  But I get that it's a reference to something.
[10665.53s -> 10675.36s]  Do I still drink Dr. Pepper?
[10675.36s -> 10677.28s]  I don't really drink soda that much anymore.
[10677.92s -> 10683.10s]  Except when it's an ice cold,
[10683.90s -> 10685.84s]  frothy Mountain Dew.
[10686.40s -> 10690.52s]  That's a Coke, by the way.
[10690.52s -> 10691.72s]  That's a Coke Coke.
[10691.72s -> 10698.33s]  And yeah, I drink probably like a soda.
[10699.05s -> 10700.97s]  Maybe like two sodas a week.
[10701.77s -> 10702.65s]  Once a week, maybe.
[10703.37s -> 10704.97s]  I drink a lot more water than anything else.
[10706.06s -> 10706.62s]  Nowadays.
[10707.34s -> 10710.57s]  No, not diet.
[10711.13s -> 10713.02s]  I don't drink diet soda.
[10713.66s -> 10725.93s]  Imagine drinking water?
[10727.31s -> 10727.95s]  What is gross?
[10727.95s -> 10728.99s]  What's wrong with water?
[10728.99s -> 10730.03s]  What, you guys don't like water?
[10730.91s -> 10740.67s]  I mean, water is boring, but you have to drink it.
[10741.47s -> 10743.60s]  Otherwise, you'll turn into...
[10743.60s -> 10744.88s]  You'll shrivel up into dust.
[10745.68s -> 10747.50s]  All right, where the hell am I?
[10747.50s -> 10747.90s]  Didn't I...
[10747.90s -> 10749.26s]  Didn't I select black water?
[10749.98s -> 10752.62s]  Why am I all the way over here?
[10753.26s -> 10755.45s]  No, I'm going to just...
[10756.09s -> 10760.00s]  I'm going to take what I can get at this point.
[10760.00s -> 10761.12s]  I want to do this mission.
[10762.00s -> 10764.72s]  I'm going to get on the horse and I'm going to walk to that mission.
[10764.72s -> 10766.88s]  I'm going to stand in the circle and go to the mission.
[10768.03s -> 10769.23s]  That's what I'm going to do.
[10771.21s -> 10772.09s]  Water is not boring?
[10772.09s -> 10773.85s]  Well, boring in the sense that it doesn't...
[10773.85s -> 10775.13s]  That water doesn't have like a taste.
[10777.08s -> 10778.28s]  It is just tasteless.
[10779.61s -> 10781.77s]  Tasteless, colorless, no additives.
[10781.77s -> 10782.41s]  It's just nothing.
[10782.41s -> 10784.01s]  It's just there and you need it.
[10786.01s -> 10787.45s]  You know, you have no horses.
[10791.68s -> 10792.64s]  What happened to my other horse?
[10801.84s -> 10802.72s]  It got deleted?
[10803.36s -> 10804.78s]  Well, why is that?
[10811.13s -> 10812.17s]  Come here, you little shit.
[10812.89s -> 10820.43s]  Why can I not...
[10822.17s -> 10822.57s]  Whatever.
[10826.24s -> 10826.80s]  All right, let's go.
[10833.29s -> 10835.50s]  I'm not going to shoot it.
[10835.50s -> 10836.94s]  I don't need it right now.
[10836.94s -> 10840.30s]  I need to just stay focused and go straight on the GPS.
[10841.34s -> 10843.71s]  Get to the mission and hope that I can do it.
[10844.35s -> 10848.67s]  And enjoy myself in RDR2-O.
[10849.63s -> 10851.63s]  RDR2-O.
[10852.27s -> 10856.64s]  I hate that title now.
[10857.28s -> 10860.97s]  That title was just a stupid reference I was making with like
[10860.97s -> 10862.01s]  100 people in the chat.
[10862.81s -> 10869.92s]  I'm changing it to that.
[10889.66s -> 10893.82s]  Yeah, that was like an IGN Plays Red Dead Online reference.
[10894.70s -> 10898.40s]  Yeah, that's better.
[10900.49s -> 10903.21s]  The lawless land of RDR2-Online.
[10903.93s -> 10917.69s]  Don't run into him, please.
[10917.69s -> 10918.09s]  Shut up.
[10918.09s -> 10918.41s]  What?
[10918.41s -> 10919.45s]  Why did you tell me to shut up?
[10919.45s -> 10920.41s]  Why did you say that, you?
[10920.41s -> 10921.05s]  Why did you say that?
[10930.17s -> 10931.45s]  Yeah, shut up.
[10931.45s -> 10939.92s]  I gotta be careful.
[10939.92s -> 10940.64s]  I'm almost there.
[10942.00s -> 10947.36s]  Just let the Rockstar servers stay online
[10947.36s -> 10949.20s]  for me to play another mission with people.
[10950.16s -> 10963.37s]  Almost there.
[10964.09s -> 10965.37s]  I'm going to go very slow too.
[10965.37s -> 10966.09s]  I'm going to get off the horse.
[10966.09s -> 10967.21s]  I'm going to walk into the marker
[10968.33s -> 10969.69s]  because maybe I'm just going too fast
[10969.69s -> 10971.05s]  and the game is trying to transition me
[10971.05s -> 10972.41s]  to another instance or another server
[10972.41s -> 10973.45s]  and it's just kicking me out.
[10983.04s -> 10984.24s]  Where are all the random events?
[10987.58s -> 10988.46s]  That's a good question.
[10990.70s -> 10995.58s]  I think they're the peach markers on the screen, right?
[10996.14s -> 10998.46s]  Aren't those the new random kind of stranger events?
[10999.26s -> 11003.60s]  I'm almost there.
[11004.56s -> 11005.92s]  Come on, just get me over there
[11005.92s -> 11007.68s]  and I'm going to walk off the horse.
[11010.51s -> 11011.87s]  Okay, slowly.
[11012.59s -> 11013.87s]  Let it load what I want to do.
[11017.42s -> 11019.82s]  Compete with other players in free roam events.
[11019.82s -> 11020.70s]  Dispatch rider.
[11030.89s -> 11031.53s]  No, no.
[11033.69s -> 11034.41s]  No!
[11034.41s -> 11035.53s]  I should have just done it.
[11035.53s -> 11037.69s]  I should have just walked into the circle.
[11037.69s -> 11039.13s]  I had an opportunity to do it
[11039.13s -> 11040.01s]  and I didn't do it.
[11063.24s -> 11064.68s]  Small indie company.
[11066.70s -> 11068.38s]  We are testing the servers
[11068.38s -> 11071.26s]  so hopefully they're getting all the data that they need.
[11071.90s -> 11076.03s]  This is a QA data.
[11076.83s -> 11081.31s]  Data beta test stream.
[11081.31s -> 11083.47s]  You're watching live QA is what you're...
[11083.47s -> 11084.83s]  I'm not broadcasting Red Dead,
[11084.83s -> 11086.19s]  I'm broadcasting testing.
[11086.83s -> 11088.43s]  I guess that is what I'm doing.
[11088.43s -> 11112.72s]  And why am I playing just to suffer?
[11113.44s -> 11115.79s]  Because I feel like when it works,
[11115.79s -> 11117.39s]  it's going to be fun and it has
[11117.39s -> 11119.07s]  and when it does work, it's interesting.
[11121.60s -> 11122.96s]  And now I'm back here again.
[11125.24s -> 11126.36s]  I'm going to go...
[11126.36s -> 11127.32s]  No, I don't want to do that.
[11127.96s -> 11129.40s]  Just go to the map.
[11129.40s -> 11130.04s]  Where am I?
[11131.64s -> 11134.84s]  I'm so much further away now than I was before.
[11134.84s -> 11136.84s]  This is just unbelievable.
[11137.64s -> 11142.89s]  This really is turning into suffering at this point.
[11142.89s -> 11144.25s]  But I want to do it.
[11144.25s -> 11145.21s]  I want to play it.
[11150.25s -> 11151.21s]  Here comes a bad review.
[11158.33s -> 11159.37s]  Just buy a plane.
[11159.93s -> 11167.87s]  Just reload until I spawn there.
[11167.87s -> 11169.07s]  I could probably get there faster
[11169.07s -> 11170.51s]  than reloading the game one time.
[11179.24s -> 11179.85s]  Okay.
[11180.73s -> 11181.82s]  Don't do anything.
[11183.37s -> 11184.81s]  Just get there.
[11184.81s -> 11185.45s]  Don't do anything.
[11185.45s -> 11186.17s]  Don't say anything.
[11188.16s -> 11191.28s]  I was fucking reading the chat
[11191.28s -> 11192.32s]  because I was seeing...
[11194.64s -> 11195.20s]  Don't do it.
[11197.32s -> 11197.88s]  Just forget them.
[11204.81s -> 11206.49s]  I couldn't even control it.
[11207.61s -> 11208.41s]  I couldn't turn.
[11209.77s -> 11210.33s]  Pull it back.
[11210.33s -> 11211.29s]  Pull it back.
[11211.29s -> 11212.97s]  I want you to pull it back.
[11212.97s -> 11213.93s]  Pull it back.
[11213.93s -> 11215.05s]  Give me a clip of that.
[11215.05s -> 11216.01s]  I'm not fucking around.
[11216.01s -> 11217.21s]  Clip that because you can hear me
[11217.21s -> 11218.57s]  press right on the stick.
[11220.27s -> 11221.87s]  Clip it and show it to me right now.
[11222.59s -> 11233.21s]  Listen to this.
[11233.21s -> 11235.90s]  I want you to listen to the click of the analog.
[11236.46s -> 11244.16s]  Fucking reading the chat
[11244.16s -> 11245.20s]  because I was seeing...
[11246.08s -> 11246.80s]  Let's hear the click.
[11247.52s -> 11248.08s]  Don't do it.
[11250.19s -> 11250.83s]  Just forget them.
[11264.76s -> 11265.32s]  Do you hear that?
[11265.32s -> 11266.36s]  Do you hear the click?
[11266.36s -> 11267.53s]  Listen to it one more time.
[11267.53s -> 11267.85s]  Right with the...
[11268.73s -> 11279.42s]  I couldn't even control it.
[11279.98s -> 11283.52s]  I couldn't control it.
[11290.65s -> 11292.25s]  This is a slight click.
[11292.25s -> 11293.93s]  No, I swear to God.
[11293.93s -> 11295.61s]  I've done dumb things before.
[11295.61s -> 11297.13s]  I've fallen off fucking cliffs.
[11297.21s -> 11326.27s]  You see, I'm laughing because, okay, I felt that...
[11326.27s -> 11329.07s]  I told you, I fucking am absent-minded.
[11329.07s -> 11330.59s]  Some dumb shit happens.
[11330.59s -> 11332.19s]  But that was not the case that time.
[11332.75s -> 11333.71s]  Just get me to the mission.
[11333.71s -> 11334.75s]  This would not have happened
[11334.75s -> 11335.79s]  if I could just play the game
[11335.79s -> 11338.11s]  that I wanted to play like 40 minutes ago.
[11342.16s -> 11343.28s]  Okay, I think it's time to stop.
[11372.19s -> 11373.71s]  Superior Vegas internet.
[11373.71s -> 11374.75s]  That's not my internet.
[11374.75s -> 11375.39s]  That's not me.
[11376.64s -> 11378.64s]  I'm losing the connection to...
[11378.64s -> 11379.68s]  Their server's a drop,
[11379.68s -> 11381.20s]  but that didn't do anything.
[11385.69s -> 11386.73s]  Try again another day.
[11386.73s -> 11388.01s]  What is here is probably fun.
[11388.57s -> 11394.73s]  I mean, I really wanted to...
[11395.37s -> 11398.33s]  I really wanted to save Jackbox for Friday
[11398.33s -> 11399.85s]  because we could do it the whole time
[11399.85s -> 11402.49s]  and we could spend like five, six, seven hours in it.
[11409.61s -> 11417.31s]  Because, I mean, it's not like I have a time limit
[11417.31s -> 11420.99s]  for the streams, but I usually start to get pretty tired
[11421.63s -> 11424.11s]  after like five or six hours streaming.
[11424.83s -> 11427.87s]  And then at about six to eight
[11427.87s -> 11429.55s]  is where I usually call it a night.
[11430.11s -> 11431.40s]  And I really don't want to...
[11431.40s -> 11432.92s]  I want to give it the time it deserves.
[11432.92s -> 11434.44s]  That's what we're doing on Friday.
[11434.44s -> 11437.64s]  Stick to the plan.
[11438.44s -> 11443.80s]  I'm there, I'm there, I'm there, I'm there.
[11445.24s -> 11445.64s]  Hold on.
[11446.20s -> 11449.12s]  Didn't have time to kick me out.
[11449.12s -> 11449.68s]  I just got in.
[11449.68s -> 11450.56s]  It's like currently beeping.
[11450.56s -> 11451.44s]  It's currently beeping to get me...
[11451.44s -> 11454.56s]  I got it, I got it, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.
[11454.56s -> 11457.10s]  Didn't have time to kick me out.
[11457.10s -> 11457.58s]  I just connected.
[11461.31s -> 11469.02s]  Oh, whoops.
[11469.66s -> 11472.49s]  Oh, it's a strange one, Horley.
[11472.49s -> 11472.97s]  We're good.
[11472.97s -> 11474.33s]  How is this little clerk?
[11474.33s -> 11475.61s]  How bad is you'd expect?
[11475.61s -> 11476.73s]  I expect a lot.
[11479.29s -> 11482.65s]  The clerk was a good man and a fine man.
[11482.65s -> 11483.37s]  That he was.
[11484.17s -> 11485.37s]  And this fella?
[11485.37s -> 11486.65s]  Well, that's their business.
[11486.65s -> 11488.73s]  Sorry, it's my first time streaming, yeah.
[11488.73s -> 11496.25s]  The world's business is kindness and gentleness and evil and brutality.
[11496.25s -> 11497.61s]  What else is there, mister?
[11497.61s -> 11504.27s]  Well, there's a whole lot else besides like lust and greed and stupidity.
[11504.83s -> 11507.87s]  Oh, mister Jones is stupid.
[11507.87s -> 11510.11s]  Oh, Jones is old.
[11510.11s -> 11513.55s]  Oh, Jones has cooked himself in the sun.
[11513.55s -> 11514.75s]  I know, I know.
[11514.75s -> 11516.19s]  Get yourself something to eat.
[11516.19s -> 11517.55s]  There's fellas need help.
[11518.35s -> 11520.27s]  Maybe this fella can help them.
[11520.27s -> 11520.67s]  Maybe.
[11521.87s -> 11523.15s]  They're on the run.
[11523.15s -> 11523.95s]  Did they beat the game?
[11523.95s -> 11524.59s]  I did not.
[11524.59s -> 11527.55s]  I had about the 43, 44% time.
[11527.55s -> 11531.32s]  My business is what they do hereafter.
[11532.33s -> 11533.53s]  That's my business.
[11533.53s -> 11535.05s]  Well, they certainly need money.
[11535.53s -> 11536.81s]  There's always money.
[11537.45s -> 11541.45s]  Money for them is as good and money for them is not so good.
[11545.53s -> 11550.01s]  By the way, make sure everyone is aware because this is the last time I'm going to be able
[11550.01s -> 11550.65s]  to talk about it.
[11552.73s -> 11555.69s]  If you have a, did I just make money?
[11555.69s -> 11556.97s]  Did somebody just take money from me?
[11556.97s -> 11560.01s]  You might as well try the sheriff at Blackwater.
[11560.01s -> 11560.73s]  He needs help.
[11560.73s -> 11561.13s]  That was weird.
[11565.05s -> 11567.29s]  I'm not streaming tomorrow so this is the last time I'm going to be able
[11567.29s -> 11573.77s]  to talk about it before Saturday or Friday, and at that point it's too late.
[11573.77s -> 11584.01s]  So as of tomorrow, midnight tomorrow, midnight tomorrow, Pacific or Eastern, I'm not sure.
[11584.01s -> 11589.21s]  But tomorrow night late is your last opportunity to put a submission in for the movie night.
[11592.57s -> 11594.09s]  Thursday, tomorrow night.
[11594.57s -> 11596.89s]  Meet me back here after you've seen them.
[11596.89s -> 11603.31s]  If you do not have a submission in, then you are not eligible for Sunday's movie night.
[11608.51s -> 11614.59s]  Now, I've seen some people say, hey, my submission is is two minutes and 40 seconds.
[11614.59s -> 11616.27s]  My submissions is three minutes.
[11616.27s -> 11616.99s]  Can you show this?
[11616.99s -> 11618.03s]  It's like three and a half minutes.
[11619.31s -> 11620.67s]  Not for not for Sunday.
[11624.04s -> 11630.04s]  Sunday is strictly for these submissions in that channel.
[11630.68s -> 11636.68s]  If you go to the Discord and the movie night channel,
[11637.48s -> 11640.52s]  follow the very specific rules that are pinned there in that channel.
[11641.48s -> 11646.25s]  I don't have a horse so we have to what do I have to go all is there anybody
[11646.25s -> 11646.97s]  even doing this with me?
[11655.15s -> 11667.29s]  I mean at this point I can't I can't load into free room.
[11669.05s -> 11671.37s]  I have to I have to just like go to single player or something,
[11671.37s -> 11673.13s]  but that's not what I wanted to do.
[11674.01s -> 11674.97s]  It's such annoying.
[11675.37s -> 11683.15s]  Uh, yeah, I can't just keep trying.
[11683.87s -> 11685.79s]  I'm going to try tomorrow the next night.
[11685.79s -> 11686.43s]  No, not tomorrow.
[11686.43s -> 11687.47s]  I can't not stream tomorrow.
[11688.51s -> 11698.57s]  Um, load in a different place.
[11700.41s -> 11701.37s]  Not West Elizabeth.
[11703.23s -> 11707.23s]  Yeah, but even when I was in these, I was dumping out on these two.
[11708.19s -> 11710.51s]  Remember I was doing exceptionally well.
[11711.07s -> 11711.95s]  I got disconnected.
[11716.76s -> 11717.88s]  Load in New Austin.
[11718.44s -> 11723.55s]  Well, for the purposes of can I change my region?
[11723.55s -> 11724.43s]  No, I don't think so.
[11725.31s -> 11727.13s]  I don't think there's any way to do that.
[11728.88s -> 11729.36s]  All right.
[11729.36s -> 11730.72s]  I'm here's what is going to happen.
[11732.08s -> 11733.44s]  Uh, I'm going to load.
[11733.44s -> 11736.40s]  I'm going to try one more time in a different place.
[11737.12s -> 11741.68s]  And if it doesn't work, then I'm just going to go play fucking Peggle 2.
[11742.64s -> 11745.16s]  For like an hour or two or something.
[11746.40s -> 11746.96s]  God damn it.
[11746.96s -> 11752.17s]  That's so the load of story mode or I don't know.
[11752.17s -> 11752.89s]  Let's try it again.
[11753.53s -> 11758.00s]  You gotta have faith.
[11758.64s -> 11761.96s]  Well, sorry to all those people watching that.
[11761.96s -> 11764.36s]  We're expecting to see Red Dead Redemption 2 multiplayer.
[11765.84s -> 11770.99s]  And what exclusivity we got here exclusively.
[11770.99s -> 11775.95s]  Hey, if you, if you, if you bought this game day one and you supported rock star
[11775.95s -> 11778.75s]  and got in and played a bunch on the first day, you got rewarded.
[11778.75s -> 11780.75s]  When you get to play the beta, you get to play the beta early.
[11782.32s -> 11787.72s]  There it is.
[11787.72s -> 11788.44s]  Doesn't quite work.
[11790.08s -> 11792.48s]  And when it does, it's seems like a fucking lot of fun.
[11793.53s -> 11797.21s]  But the beta has just seemed like a gigantic network stress test,
[11797.21s -> 11797.93s]  which makes sense.
[11797.93s -> 11798.65s]  Okay, that's fine.
[11799.71s -> 11802.43s]  But not really, uh, not really completely playable yet.
[11808.88s -> 11810.40s]  And we can't even do it anymore.
[11810.40s -> 11819.39s]  Oh, well, fault.
[11819.39s -> 11822.03s]  There's a fault on rock star's game services.
[11826.28s -> 11835.63s]  Well, Peggle time.
[11843.66s -> 11844.06s]  Damn it.
[11845.26s -> 11847.90s]  If, okay, if the stream had been going for like five hours,
[11847.90s -> 11849.02s]  maybe like Peggle 2.
[11849.02s -> 11849.26s]  Okay.
[11849.26s -> 11850.78s]  That's funny for like 40 minutes.
[11851.42s -> 11860.43s]  Just played Red.
[11860.43s -> 11865.26s]  I, I, I'm sorry, guys.
[11867.26s -> 11869.26s]  It's kind of completely out of my hands at this point.
[11869.90s -> 11876.43s]  So, um, I mean, I could, here's, here's what's going to happen.
[11876.43s -> 11876.83s]  All right.
[11876.83s -> 11877.63s]  Let's be real.
[11879.44s -> 11883.36s]  Uh, I have to install Peggle 2 and it's going to take like six hours.
[11885.42s -> 11887.34s]  I'm going to move to Red Dead single player.
[11887.98s -> 11889.50s]  I still am like halfway through the game.
[11891.15s -> 11897.05s]  And then after like an hour or so, like another hour, two hours or something,
[11897.05s -> 11898.17s]  we'll try the multiplayer again.
[11898.81s -> 11907.28s]  We'll just do the, we'll just stay in Red Dead
[11907.28s -> 11908.48s]  because that's what I wanted to do.
[11908.48s -> 11909.52s]  I wanted to play Red Dead.
[11910.40s -> 11915.55s]  And it's, once we go off the rails and it's like, oh, Peggle and then Bloodborne.
[11915.55s -> 11919.07s]  And then, um, um, uh, what else do I have on PS4?
[11920.11s -> 11920.91s]  Flash games.
[11920.91s -> 11926.27s]  I'd rather just stay fairly, uh, fairly in the same, uh, same realm.
