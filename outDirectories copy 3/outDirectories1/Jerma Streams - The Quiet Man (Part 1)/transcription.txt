[2.10s -> 11.67s]  Your tail is my favorite game ever made. Hey guys, how you doing? Hopefully things are going well.
[14.97s -> 23.72s]  That is banana. That is peanut butter. And that is almond milk. One, two, three. The trifecta.
[28.54s -> 33.18s]  Jeremy, what's the latest smoothie that you're drinking right now? Because every six months
[33.18s -> 40.01s]  you talk about a smoothie. Well, hold on a minute here. Banana. One banana. Two scoops of
[40.01s -> 53.94s]  peanut butter. Almond milk. Into a glass. Slurp it up. I got coffee here too. I got a peanut
[53.94s -> 65.06s]  butter banana smoothie and I got a coffee. That was a blender, yeah. Am I doing well? I'm
[65.06s -> 74.62s]  doing well. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. So tonight we're going to play a game called
[74.62s -> 80.84s]  The Quiet Man, which is a Square Enix game. Kind of flew under the radar here for me,
[81.72s -> 92.12s]  but it's an FMV game that is also not an FMV game. It's like an action game with choices and
[92.84s -> 99.00s]  you play the main character is deaf. So I don't, you can't like hear. I don't know.
[100.84s -> 109.66s]  It is apparently awful, but it looked pretty, it looked like I had to play it. We'll just put
[109.66s -> 127.54s]  it that way. This game isn't fun bad. It's bad bad. Well, we'll have to, I'm gonna stomach
[127.54s -> 131.06s]  through it. I don't think it's more than, I think it's only three or four hours long.
[131.86s -> 135.53s]  That's, let's just do it, right? Should I, am I going to be able to do this?
[136.17s -> 145.34s]  Or will I give up? The game isn't fun at all.
[152.09s -> 155.45s]  Here's something about, let's get out of here. Let's take a look at this.
[156.09s -> 160.58s]  Here's the menu. All right. So this is, this is one of the menus. Look at this menu.
[166.34s -> 178.15s]  Any idea what this shit is? When I, when I first loaded the game, it said,
[178.15s -> 184.09s]  this is subtitles and that's, they're on. This is supposed to be difficulty. So I think this is
[184.73s -> 190.82s]  mom yelling at little kid who's scared, but then this is normal mode. This is hard mode
[190.82s -> 198.30s]  where a little kid gets a Mario mushroom and screams at mom. I don't know how this means
[198.30s -> 205.38s]  it's harder. Like, is this, is that supposed to be me in this scenario? And this is the game.
[207.22s -> 210.10s]  Shouldn't it be the other way around? Or is this supposed to be me and this is the game?
[210.74s -> 219.10s]  Well, anyway, I don't, I have no idea what this is. They didn't tell me what this was.
[220.25s -> 227.67s]  It's just, this is a group of people that are highlighted now. I don't know what this is.
[230.57s -> 255.43s]  Door? What do you mean door? Just hit play? What do you mean by door? Hold on. Kim,
[255.43s -> 300.26s]  Kim is like texting me. Hold on a second. It was very, I ran down there and she,
[301.14s -> 308.44s]  she kept saying door. She's pointing at the door. I was like, okay, I opened the door
[308.44s -> 321.90s]  and then there's nothing there. Anyways, let's play. This is the quiet man. I think it's in
[321.90s -> 340.57s]  the right settings. I'm just going to press play. Door bottom right. All right. All right.
[340.57s -> 366.65s]  Let's go. Seattle, 1998, New York. I mean, is this Spider-Man? Spider-Man full motion video
[366.65s -> 374.90s]  experience. That's me. I got, I've got the black Spider-Man suit on. I've got the venom suit on.
[387.00s -> 394.06s]  Wait, isn't this how infamous starts a prototype? I like that hair. That's good hair.
[394.62s -> 409.11s]  He's got great hair. This is a Square Enix game by the way. They, I don't know what they had
[409.11s -> 412.87s]  to do with this, but they apparently published it or maybe they made it. I don't know.
[413.51s -> 435.24s]  Do I get to control the character? Why is the guy not talking? Why is he just putting his
[435.24s -> 442.89s]  sandwich in a bag? I didn't even order anything. This guy is just getting his lunch ready.
[456.18s -> 460.18s]  It's the sound. Does it make it quiet? Oh shit. I'll turn it up. I'll turn it up.
[460.98s -> 473.85s]  I'll turn it up. Oh, peanut butter and jelly again. Dad, can I at least get some
[473.85s -> 477.13s]  tuna fish next time? Remember that? Write that down. That's a map.
[479.88s -> 490.68s]  Now this guy steps to my lady and says, wait,
[501.62s -> 502.34s]  I'm not reading it.
[506.98s -> 515.10s]  Where'd the subtitles go? Why, why am I walking down this alley right now?
[516.38s -> 518.06s]  Is there a reason why I'm doing this?
[518.06s -> 528.22s]  Am I like a crime fighter? I don't understand. What am I doing?
[530.14s -> 534.86s]  Am I like trying to find back alleyways of people doing things wrong?
[534.86s -> 547.05s]  These guys are just sitting around talking. Okay, here we go.
[549.67s -> 554.23s]  What do I do? Do I have to press a button? Do I press a button?
[556.81s -> 560.46s]  Am I supposed to punch? I didn't do any of that.
[561.93s -> 575.05s]  Am I a robot? I'm a robot built by someone to patrol or something.
[586.49s -> 594.01s]  Now we're no longer a full motion video game. Now we're CG. How do I throw punches?
[594.81s -> 603.08s]  Who do I target? What? Oh, I'm being electrocuted. This is immersion. What?
[604.04s -> 606.60s]  No, it's got the controller. It's got the controller.
[609.34s -> 611.02s]  How am I? What am I? How do I punch?
[621.27s -> 630.92s]  It didn't even tell me how to play the game. Okay, that's it. I did it.
[641.90s -> 652.89s]  Where is my tutorial? Where am I?
[662.30s -> 665.02s]  Weren't we just in full motion video? Why did we downgrade?
[665.74s -> 668.66s]  Is there a reason why the graphics is downgraded?
[669.22s -> 674.12s]  Well, wouldn't this be, this would cost more money doing full CG animations.
[674.12s -> 677.24s]  This costs more money than getting actors to act in front of the camera.
[679.00s -> 684.87s]  Options. Why does it give me the options, man? Why are they watching
[684.87s -> 688.63s]  a TV channel with options, man? Were they just playing Call of Duty and had to stop
[688.63s -> 701.38s]  because I came in? I don't understand. I think I lost.
[706.52s -> 717.56s]  This is, I don't like this. This is weird. Great stock footage.
[718.84s -> 725.98s]  What? Okay, so they have stock footage like hello, baby. I'm like kissing you. Hi, baby.
[726.78s -> 733.75s]  I'm a baby in a crib. Okay, this is a dodge. It's not very useful.
[734.39s -> 744.86s]  At least I have like a super dash. Is there anything else I can do?
[744.86s -> 757.67s]  At least a grab. Can I lock? What the fuck is happening?
[760.33s -> 764.25s]  Okay, left trigger activates quiet mode or something.
[764.81s -> 769.86s]  Oh, that's right. It is on hard. This is not, I didn't, this,
[769.86s -> 772.90s]  this lower frame rate is proving to you that I'm not playing the game anymore.
[773.62s -> 788.84s]  This is a rendered, uh, full rendered motion. What the fuck are you showing me?
[798.97s -> 806.25s]  Oh, this is, I can't, I get it. It's the controls. I see. Okay.
[807.13s -> 817.67s]  So the X is punch. A is dodge. Wait, what was that? If you dodge perfectly,
[818.23s -> 823.62s]  then you get to punch him. B is also punch, somehow.
[824.95s -> 832.23s]  Why is kick? But why was grab? This is super mode. This is sprint.
[839.53s -> 846.04s]  Oh, no, that's not what I wanted to do. How do I get out of this? No.
[849.56s -> 854.89s]  Okay. The end. You beat it. So there's a sprint.
[855.61s -> 878.14s]  I don't know where I'm supposed to be going. Here we are. Back in time, I guess.
[885.34s -> 893.18s]  That me? That's supposed to be me. That guy did a pretty good green screen. That guy did.
[895.62s -> 898.66s]  You know, I mean, I mean, you stand in front of a green screen and you make a bunch of
[898.90s -> 907.05s]  all of a sudden, like now everybody wants to do it. Is there a lock on? I don't think there is.
[907.85s -> 918.68s]  I'm pretty sure there's no lock on. This has to be getting to a point where I can do something
[918.68s -> 931.16s]  else, right? Why are you watching me crying? Why? Why is it super imposing this shit on the
[931.16s -> 954.65s]  screen? What's going on? I don't even know what to say. I have nothing to say. I thought
[954.73s -> 959.85s]  we might have some stuff to talk about here, but we don't. We just don't. I'm beating the whole game,
[959.85s -> 985.69s]  by the way. Can you please play something else? Not yet. Nice. I got him in the tub. I did that.
[986.25s -> 1002.09s]  I just got an achievement that says, Oh, what to say. I don't know what to say.
[1002.09s -> 1007.00s]  I'm not. I don't know who we are. I don't know why we're doing this. I don't know. All
[1007.00s -> 1022.81s]  I know is we got lunch in a bag. That's it. I was given a bag lunch club, club normies.
[1031.88s -> 1046.41s]  No, we're good. Jeremy, can you turn the game up? I can't hear it. I can't hear it either.
[1055.93s -> 1059.93s]  How am I supposed to make the decision? Should I make decisions?
[1060.65s -> 1075.32s]  You can't. I can't make any decisions. Well, that's mine now. Dub it. Okay. Yeah.
[1081.99s -> 1084.07s]  I can't think of anything. Hold on. I gotta take this.
[1084.87s -> 1092.41s]  I was just like a lip matching it. Now here we go.
[1101.32s -> 1150.25s]  20. Let's see. 40. 60. $100. There it is in the case.
[1152.57s -> 1155.86s]  Oh, you made it here. Finally. Didn't think you were going to show up.
[1156.50s -> 1170.42s]  Did you get lost out there somewhere? 25. 50. Yeah. $50. So here, here's all the money we took
[1170.42s -> 1187.83s]  in from. Oh, briefcase. Is that new? Wow. And you were the only person to remember my birthday.
[1189.51s -> 1197.05s]  And I love Coke. I'm really glad you got this for me. Anyone watch you bring this in? I mean,
[1199.61s -> 1207.34s]  right on the chin. Me and you are going to do it together right now. Right. Anyways.
[1219.13s -> 1223.45s]  Let me take a look. Well, I know them. Yeah.
[1225.74s -> 1229.54s]  I actually was there when he drew it. I told him it looked like shit, but
[1230.36s -> 1233.08s]  he didn't want to correct it. I told him it should look more like a
[1234.12s -> 1237.16s]  Jackson Pollock painting than anything else, but he didn't want to listen.
[1238.28s -> 1241.00s]  What a weird, what a fucking idiot. You know what I mean? But you,
[1241.88s -> 1249.42s]  you could do a much. Hey, what's up? I'm trying to help you here. If you have run
[1249.42s -> 1252.30s]  to the chin, we're supposed to be doing this Coke right now and you are going to
[1252.30s -> 1257.16s]  rip the phone out of my hand. That's unbelievable. My fucking birthday, man.
[1257.40s -> 1269.11s]  Anyway, I have to, you know, if you want to go on a date with me, and how's the time to say it?
[1271.11s -> 1280.92s]  The body, mother of Christ compels us. Remember when we were kids, I've got your shoes.
[1289.53s -> 1299.94s]  Give me my shoes back. No, they're mine. Oh, I gotta help someone. Hold on.
[1300.10s -> 1312.15s]  I gotta help someone. Hold on. Hey. All right. Yeah, those shoes, they were expensive,
[1312.15s -> 1314.87s]  very expensive. And I'm glad that you came over there and screamed at them,
[1314.87s -> 1321.83s]  but it didn't really help that much. Oh, I just broke my finger. Oh, it's all right.
[1321.83s -> 1353.05s]  These motherfuckers are strong. Yeah. Yeah. To you, to us. I'll meet you outside. Five
[1353.05s -> 1375.70s]  million. This is way harder. This is hard. Have a look. What do you think?
[1377.67s -> 1381.61s]  I was thinking of sending it to her. You know, okay, sure. If I wanted to see her,
[1382.90s -> 1388.06s]  see her kids again, you know, what do you think? Is it too much? Yeah, I think it might be.
[1392.09s -> 1399.06s]  Took me a long time to make it though. I am the business of ransom. It's just,
[1399.06s -> 1410.76s]  you know, not easy. Maybe you could go there and convince them. Yeah. Well, you,
[1410.76s -> 1413.40s]  you don't have the superpowers. I don't have any superpowers. Come on.
[1414.04s -> 1417.08s]  I just wanted to make a couple extra dollars, make some more millions.
[1419.98s -> 1424.09s]  Press one for refund. Play for one hour and then refund.
[1433.27s -> 1437.51s]  Oh, I wish I had like other items here. How long do they get to hold it here before
[1437.51s -> 1443.27s]  I burn my hand? I'm going to say probably 10 seconds. And that's why I say,
[1445.75s -> 1448.55s]  I burnt my hand already. Were you thinking about something?
[1449.70s -> 1453.14s]  I just can't even imagine, you know, it's really, let me tell you something,
[1453.14s -> 1457.30s]  you know, it really pisses me off lately. The whole, it's, I mean, it's not even Thanksgiving
[1458.02s -> 1467.85s]  and I mean, I see, I see. Hold on. Words with friends just popped up. I am the pretty much
[1467.85s -> 1471.45s]  number one in the region of words with friends. So sorry, I'm going to take an extra minute
[1471.45s -> 1484.90s]  here. Christmas decorations. You know what I'm saying? I want to punch them. I'd love,
[1484.90s -> 1489.32s]  I'd love to punch a Christmas decoration in the face. You know what I'm saying? Like
[1489.32s -> 1496.97s]  right in the face. Oh, with a shovel or a rock. Not even Thanksgiving yet.
[1500.15s -> 1510.36s]  Like, you know, a rope maybe. Sprangle. Yeah. You and me. We're going to go vandalize
[1510.36s -> 1529.38s]  Christmas decoration. Why is this? Oh, King's words. I want you to imagine this. If this,
[1529.38s -> 1544.63s]  if there wasn't a dub here. It's a five minute silent cut scene. What does it want me to do?
[1545.59s -> 1552.25s]  I have, oh, go over to the flowers. Am I going to eat them? Is this actually supposed
[1552.25s -> 1563.16s]  to be muted? Yeah. What is this? Turn up the volume. There is no volume. That's like the
[1563.16s -> 1570.23s]  point of the whole game. There is no sound. I don't, it's not that I have the volume
[1570.23s -> 1578.68s]  turned down. There is no volume. Turn on subtitles. They're already on, but there's a splash screen
[1578.68s -> 1582.60s]  at the beginning of the game that says, hey, subtitles are on, but you're not going to see
[1582.60s -> 1589.11s]  them unless it's in a specific situation where you can actually hear them. Wow. The iPhone sure
[1589.11s -> 1595.27s]  did get fucking good. That was the best photo I think I've ever seen. That's like iPhone
[1595.27s -> 1608.15s]  16. Again, I'm going to reiterate this point one more time. Go to a stock footage site and
[1608.15s -> 1616.92s]  type in like woman smiling in bed or makeup commercial or toothpaste commercial.
[1616.92s -> 1638.17s]  One of those three will do. I was, I was specifically told before the stream started,
[1639.82s -> 1648.55s]  do not play this game. It's not funny. It's just, it's just not even good. But I,
[1650.57s -> 1661.14s]  well, we can, we're going over for free. What if I just don't move?
[1662.02s -> 1670.34s]  All right. Those are the moves you make when your cat's going crazy and you're like a
[1670.34s -> 1677.03s]  afraid of what it's going to do next. That's somebody that there's like a, there's a cat or
[1677.03s -> 1687.82s]  a dog in the room and they're like, oh, oh, hold on. Those are the moves you made during
[1687.82s -> 1703.13s]  the green screen. Well, you guys know what to do. Hey, you got to pay for that. Grab,
[1703.13s -> 1711.05s]  throw. That was a pretty nice knee. This won the golden joystick award over red dead.
[1712.25s -> 1723.91s]  No, it did not. It did not. I'm sorry to say it's the same two moves.
[1726.30s -> 1747.62s]  What? You got back up. Why is he getting back up? Oh, now he has a saw. Oh wait,
[1747.62s -> 1794.44s]  I thought this was still in the subway. I'm not dubbing this scene. Okay. Lazy streamer. No,
[1794.44s -> 1808.18s]  I can't. Lame. What? Are you serious? Are you serious? Well, I get to be the only person
[1808.18s -> 1816.58s]  that's ever beaten this game on stream. Do you think that's a 100% guarantee? Maybe I'll
[1816.58s -> 1831.48s]  get invited to Square Enix's next launch party. That was pretty nice. Dude, this is just a
[1831.48s -> 1837.00s]  wrestling game. He's gotten four sweet chin musics in a row. He should be done. No,
[1837.00s -> 1862.31s]  he has a knife. Can I pick up the machete? What? Just now all of a sudden you can block.
[1862.87s -> 1876.70s]  These are identical to my green screen kicks. The boss, this is a boss, isn't it?
[1882.26s -> 1890.07s]  Now we got to wait for the train. Skip to the next game. It's only been 30. I
[1890.07s -> 1900.09s]  feel like I've been here for two hours. It's been 30 minutes. No, no, this is lame. No.
[1901.61s -> 1969.03s]  Get off me. Yeah. My son, I think. I can't do a dog. Hold on. Yes, I can.
[1975.06s -> 2011.70s]  I can't do a dog. Hello. My phone just actually rang. She's calling me. You had
[2011.70s -> 2022.10s]  that ready? I swear to God. No, I just got a phone call right now. I did not have that ready,
[2039.35s -> 2072.10s]  but you told me to freeze. Was it a dead bird? This is not CG. This is, instead of FMV dad,
[2072.10s -> 2084.14s]  this is CG dad. Right this way? Hey, thanks. Yeah, you can close it. Nervous. I'm so
[2084.14s -> 2091.14s]  nervous about this. I mean, we had our troubles, but it's worth a shot to see.
[2109.66s -> 2126.55s]  Funny you to show up. Well, got the flowers. Oh, I forgot you're allergic. Sorry. You want?
[2126.55s -> 2138.38s]  Hey, shut up. You just look handsome and light here. Do I? Maybe we could potentially
[2139.18s -> 2163.35s]  work things out tonight. It's hard. Oh, uh, you know, I tough to come out here like this
[2163.35s -> 2175.42s]  and try to, you know what I'm saying? I know what you're saying. Hey, uh, hold on. Will you?
[2177.93s -> 2181.83s]  No, he's already school. He's with me. I don't know who the fuck this guy is.
[2181.83s -> 2195.50s]  Just thinks you're gonna walk in here. Hey, uh, sorry. Um, fuck are you doing? You know,
[2195.50s -> 2199.34s]  I'm trying to fucking fix this here to get that fucking out of here. You brought a dead bird.
[2200.14s -> 2212.57s]  What do you bring a dead bird over to me and my ex? Fucking idiot. Don't look. I know we play
[2212.57s -> 2218.70s]  the pretend detective game together and we try to find the criminals, but this is not the
[2218.70s -> 2231.03s]  time of the place, dude. Go home. Call mom. Okay, uh, we're back here. He just got lost.
[2231.03s -> 2236.07s]  This guy, I don't really know him. He got lost. But, um, anyways, so dinner tomorrow night,
[2236.07s -> 2244.50s]  potentially, if you, if you could have me. Hey, what the, why did you just do that? Oh,
[2248.14s -> 2255.13s]  no, no, you can't get. So, uh, I get how my, my little brother is going to come with
[2255.21s -> 2268.46s]  us. And, um, that's ain't fucking awkward at all. Is it? Your little brother sucks.
[2269.18s -> 2280.62s]  Just be easy on him. He's kind of a weirdo. He's a dead bird in the car. It just might
[2280.62s -> 2283.34s]  stink a little bit. It probably smells like a dead animal, but just,
[2283.98s -> 2285.50s]  he's a little weird. Just let him, let him be.
[2297.50s -> 2304.82s]  He went from potential boyfriend to little brother. Mike is muted.
[2304.82s -> 2319.78s]  So, um, can I see the bird? I love birds. Is it a sparrow or maybe a chickadee or something
[2319.78s -> 2346.33s]  like that? You don't have to be shy. I was going to say it's a blue Jay. Please voice
[2346.33s -> 2360.84s]  the main character. Please stop playing this. I can't, I can't. Do you understand? Hey,
[2361.56s -> 2377.85s]  let's try something here. I mean, I need to compose myself. Hold on. You know, I,
[2377.85s -> 2395.11s]  I like to collect birds. This is not good. I know I'm trying. You decide if you want to
[2395.11s -> 2415.37s]  play this crap or not. All right. The achievement I just got is called Stargazer
[2415.45s -> 2424.57s]  storm chaser. Everyone's just going on dates. Sorry. Club normies.
[2437.58s -> 2453.67s]  Welcome to club normies. Come on in. This is where the joke's so good. You made it twice.
[2453.67s -> 2458.49s]  No, I have this too many people here. I can't, I can't keep this up with like a hundred
[2458.49s -> 2470.55s]  people. This wine's delicious. Oh, that's a good Scott.
[2487.13s -> 2490.17s]  Important. This is really important. I don't fucking care. It is important.
[2490.97s -> 2495.72s]  So you guys have to deal with this. I can't receive a phone call right now. This is too
[2495.72s -> 2535.02s]  important. Okay, here we go. The song goes out to my, one of my closest friends in the
[2535.02s -> 2591.58s]  audience right now, dedicated to them because they mean so much to me. Nice.
[2677.74s -> 2693.70s]  It's time. Yeah. Oh, no, no, I'm not supposed to pull the fire on quick. Get like a
[2705.78s -> 2720.02s]  chair. Oh, wait. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, it's electric. That guy sneezed. No.
[2724.46s -> 2727.34s]  If you want to see her again and you'll be in trouble.
[2735.62s -> 2736.10s]  Come here.
[2747.67s -> 2775.64s]  Now there really is no sound. Did I break it? Make punching noises.
[2775.64s -> 2797.27s]  I need more sounds to do that. Um, is this guy going to go down?
[2801.77s -> 2829.53s]  Oh, so, so long ago, the bird kid long. I've waited for this moment.
[2834.34s -> 2857.72s]  Maybe we'll see what you have boss fight boss fight. This is the
[2857.72s -> 2880.82s]  flamest fucking boss fight I've ever seen. This guy sucks. No, no, no. Don't let him do it.
[2880.82s -> 2892.09s]  I'm just absolutely ratatatatting this guy's head. He's still going.
[2903.45s -> 2910.31s]  You can't match my strength. You didn't even say that. Somebody dubbing over it did.
[2914.78s -> 2917.78s]  No, my sniper rod.
[2922.22s -> 2969.29s]  No, don't. Yeah, that was my plan. Get. Oh, get me that car. Somebody call the police on
[2969.29s -> 2976.78s]  that car. Somebody call the police. It's so unnecessary. You just did that for the cameras
[2976.78s -> 2987.62s]  that are obviously there. What's this? Oh, more fighting. Gas station. We're fighting
[2987.62s -> 3011.56s]  in front of the gas station right now. Dodge. I feel like that's how I would dodge in a fight.
[3011.56s -> 3036.76s]  Nice. Broke his concentration. That was a pretty good combo over the car. Okay. Um, I
[3036.76s -> 3042.26s]  think like I really like people probably work hard on this. There's probably a lot of
[3042.82s -> 3047.14s]  talented people with talented coders and stuff. But if I'm the executive producer at Square Enix
[3048.02s -> 3051.46s]  and you showed me that last, this last hole, maybe five minutes, 10 minutes here,
[3052.26s -> 3058.52s]  I'd probably be like, okay, yeah, that's uh, okay. And I would, I would turn around
[3058.52s -> 3089.66s]  and I would do the bite my finger thing. Like, Oh fuck. Did I lose? That's a great
[3089.66s -> 3095.90s]  thumbnail. That's a really good thumbnail. I told you I was a baby. Everybody talked shit.
[3095.98s -> 3100.54s]  What do you mean baby? Question marks, baby. I'm the baby there. And she's looking at me going,
[3100.54s -> 3121.11s]  Oh, look, there's my little baby. The camera shaking so much. I mean, like the actual
[3121.67s -> 3131.61s]  full motion video scenes that look like a lot went into them. How old am I? This character?
[3132.33s -> 3138.25s]  Um, well, if I was a baby, then I don't know, like seven or eight years have gone by.
[3139.37s -> 3164.31s]  I'm probably nine. Nice. How, why, how would I have caught up with this car?
[3166.81s -> 3173.83s]  That is like an extraordinary amount of non-damage. You get out of that car. For a second,
[3173.83s -> 3180.22s]  I thought that guy was not going to notice I did that. Oh, come on. No, I want to run behind
[3180.22s -> 3189.58s]  the car. That guy was just doing laundry or something. What the fuck? We have to see this
[3189.58s -> 3197.77s]  through. You understand? The game is apparently over in like an hour. I'm going to see this
[3197.77s -> 3207.34s]  whole thing through. You don't, you really don't, but don't you want to know what happened?
[3208.14s -> 3227.91s]  I need to know what happens. That's a pretty good strategy until I get fucking murdered.
[3237.14s -> 3244.33s]  See, I'm very clearly lying on my back as a baby. Just wait until you see the diaper
[3244.33s -> 3249.42s]  go into frame. She's going to hold up like a big poopy diaper and be like, Oh,
[3250.06s -> 3280.73s]  I'm just going to spam. Who cares about actual inputs here? That was the hardest
[3280.73s -> 3285.83s]  punch I've ever seen. Why is the salad muffled? That's part of the game. It's part of the
[3285.83s -> 3297.30s]  experience. I just lost again. I lost again. This guy punched me twice and I died. All right,
[3297.30s -> 3316.92s]  come on. Oh yeah. That's poopy. Nevermind. Just wait till it fucking happens, man.
[3316.92s -> 3323.13s]  You guys will say whatever you want to say now. All right. I'm not going to fucking
[3323.13s -> 3334.70s]  lose again. The game is on hard. Just remember that it's on hard. Why do I have this on hard?
[3334.70s -> 3344.87s]  I'm already dead. I think, I think that guy's character, I think that guy's broken.
[3345.43s -> 3361.24s]  That's the only guy. Why am I waiting for this? Why am I waiting for the diaper? It's
[3361.24s -> 3366.36s]  not going to happen. It's not going to happen. All right. Who cares? Put it on like the
[3366.36s -> 3384.55s]  baby mode. The targeting doesn't make any sense either. It just randomly goes at a
[3384.55s -> 3393.67s]  sir. I can't like target anybody. Like the guy behind me. Like I can't, what am I supposed to do?
[3394.31s -> 3412.79s]  Just press B? I mean you really feel like Batman. Ah, he's trying to sneak up on me.
[3413.35s -> 3423.67s]  There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. I thought he was going to disappear.
[3424.39s -> 3433.64s]  Yeah, come on. Of course. Wilds. See that took a lot of planning. That was, that was in
[3438.28s -> 3461.24s]  what? All right. Okay. Tyler Durden. No, don't hold on. Don't do it yet.
[3463.26s -> 3481.85s]  Oh, here's the other group. Why do they become wild birds that just fly away? I don't understand.
[3481.85s -> 3497.56s]  Was this like the next tier up? Oh, it's my friends. Refund the game. Should I keep playing?
[3498.20s -> 3501.88s]  No, no, man. I mean, really what you should do is just, this is the point of the story
[3501.88s -> 3506.28s]  where we're giving you a chance to refund. So if you want to just go ahead and you can
[3506.28s -> 3512.14s]  hit escape, right? No, no way, man. Hold on though. Hold on. Remember after two hours,
[3512.14s -> 3520.30s]  it's not going to, I don't want to. I am going to keep playing this game until I finish it.
[3520.30s -> 3525.16s]  You understand? Dude. All right. Well, that was your last opportunity.
[3526.34s -> 3540.46s]  Fuck it. Who cares? I'm going for the end. See you later. Oh, did you break that? That
[3540.46s -> 3555.54s]  was my fucking car. That's actually what he probably said. What's up next? Dump it.
[3567.62s -> 3573.19s]  He bought. The game is three hours long. Well, we're 33% of the way through it.
[3583.64s -> 3597.90s]  Stop, please. Two more hours. Hold on. Somebody confirmed that for me. Is this game
[3597.90s -> 3612.12s]  over? Okay. That was interesting. It's four hours. All right. Well, how about this?
[3613.22s -> 3615.78s]  After it gets to the point where I can't refund the game anymore, I'll stop.
[3624.36s -> 3626.36s]  I mean, it's either this or we're going back to Hitman.
[3628.10s -> 3636.89s]  Average is two hours and 40 minutes. I'll get it done. Hitman. Yeah, it's either this or Hitman
[3636.89s -> 3642.58s]  because I want to play a couple of the other missions. I think I'm almost, I think it's over.
[3643.40s -> 3652.06s]  I went by so, I did it so quickly. Please God play this over Hitman.
[3652.06s -> 3675.03s]  I don't know why part of me thinks this is funny. One guy said that. Yeah. Yeah. So what's,
[3675.03s -> 3681.72s]  what's the point? What's the point? Nobody said that. Yes, they did. Go look at the chat.
[3685.78s -> 3715.50s]  That's a Blavo keyboard. Don't you know, there's probably like two more piano scenes.
[3722.42s -> 3728.76s]  Break the keyboard. No, that Blavo keyboard was already grinded up in a meat grinder somewhere.
[3736.44s -> 3758.33s]  Now, whatever they do, I've recycled it. Low viewers, low donation, bad stream, not funny,
[3758.33s -> 3770.17s]  still watching. Hey, hold on. Listen, that's all right. That's, that's all right. That's
[3770.17s -> 3786.63s]  fine. Look, I'm going to, I'm going to beat this game. Come on. It's not all right. It's
[3786.71s -> 3795.62s]  not fine. Everyone has a bad stream now and again. Bad stream. I'm having a great time.
[3796.42s -> 3802.71s]  I'm having fun. I'm having a good time. I wonder how many times I have to say that
[3802.71s -> 3813.21s]  to myself before it becomes true. Okay. I am getting a little tired of just like the enemies
[3813.21s -> 3818.50s]  in the room. All right. All right. It's about to stop. I'm about to turn it off.
[3819.66s -> 3823.10s]  All right. Hold on. I'm about to turn it off. I'm about to turn it off. Okay.
[3823.74s -> 3847.61s]  I'm not going to refund it. Keep playing. It's like, I can't, I'm wedged inside of a giant vice
[3847.61s -> 3852.41s]  right now. And on one side of the, one of the wedges are people saying, continue to play.
[3852.41s -> 3856.33s]  And the other wedge are people screaming at me to play something else. I'm going to get
[3856.33s -> 3867.46s]  crushed. I'm going to get squished every 10 minutes. It gets closer. Like my hands are
[3867.46s -> 3871.22s]  up and the two wedges are coming in and I'm like, Oh shit, this is getting serious.
[3871.22s -> 3898.14s]  Squish him. Somebody said fucking squish him. Squish him. Kill him.
[3901.56s -> 3916.30s]  Wait, what? Cut scene, fight scene, cut scene, fight scene, cut scene, fight scene.
[3920.87s -> 3926.36s]  Make him into a puree. All right. We're going to do a poll. Okay.
[3927.16s -> 3933.99s]  We will let democracy reign. I'm going to do a poll and we're going to see what you guys
[3934.71s -> 3955.50s]  want me to do. Okay. By the way, that poll is in 45 minutes. Oh, got a little closer.
[3956.14s -> 3983.72s]  Crush it. Doing a poll later will reduce the range of votes.
[3991.46s -> 4009.34s]  I was getting a piano ready, but I don't think we need it. You guys didn't think it was mom.
[4009.34s -> 4020.97s]  Look, terrible, terrible, terrible.
[4021.37s -> 4036.66s]  Uh, we're about to get to the story climax. Come on. This is where we get to. Here's the big
[4036.66s -> 4044.15s]  reveal. I hear you with my blood. Here we go. Big like story reveal. Who's the skeleton?
[4044.71s -> 4071.62s]  Why can I not hurt you? What's going on? What? This is just like, I feel like I'm
[4071.62s -> 4078.14s]  just shooting me with a fucking gun. What the fuck was that? I just got taunt killed.
[4079.02s -> 4109.29s]  I really, I honestly, ah, he's getting close. He's getting close. He's getting close to run away.
[4109.29s -> 4118.73s]  Ah, damn it. I need to know who this is under there. I'm invested in the hour and 45 minutes
[4118.73s -> 4137.26s]  story. All right. I just, I just kicked the shit out of you. You're going to do some combos
[4137.26s -> 4143.05s]  and it's going to be the mom. It has to be right. And then I'll delete the game.
[4143.05s -> 4151.98s]  Well, all right. Here's a scenario. If it's mom under there, I delete the game and refund it.
[4152.70s -> 4157.10s]  If it's me under there, if I take the mask off and it's my face and it's been me the whole time,
[4157.90s -> 4167.10s]  then I play for another four hours. Okay. And I've just been beating my like self up in
[4167.10s -> 4188.50s]  my bedroom. We got our room with the mask. Take off that mask. Here it comes. Here comes a
[4188.50s -> 4209.03s]  Scooby Doo reveal. How did we turn just from here to where did the bird go? What? Where did
[4209.03s -> 4232.63s]  the bird go? Delete game. No, that wasn't one of the options. Please delete game. No,
[4232.63s -> 4242.87s]  I'm going to write an entire review. I'm going to get hired by IGN. I'm going to write a
[4242.87s -> 4249.69s]  review of this game because I need to complete it. And then I'm going to put my two weeks
[4249.69s -> 4285.48s]  notice in it. Okay. So now this isn't wirehead. I thought it was going to be a game like that
[4285.48s -> 4294.79s]  from the trailer. It looked like it was going to be a FMV kind of game. I was misled by the
[4294.79s -> 4309.51s]  trailer. Next time I die, I have to make a poll. Okay. That's fair. Why did you choose this
[4309.51s -> 4321.32s]  game? I don't know because we've had fun with FMV games before. I thought this could have been
[4321.32s -> 4328.86s]  another one, but it's just walk from room to room and fight enemy. And then, and they've
[4328.86s -> 4336.82s]  also paused. This is the same room I was in before. Did the game reset? I'm confused here.
[4336.82s -> 4347.19s]  This is the same room I was in. The game didn't reset, did it? Did I lose my save file?
[4347.19s -> 4387.86s]  It's the same room, same TV. Didn't the same thing happen? What? The police are here now.
[4387.86s -> 4401.11s]  Everybody freeze. Where there was a disturbance. I've been able to open all these doors.
[4405.14s -> 4421.69s]  This is a disturbance. This is the police. Put your hands up. Put a poll in chat.
[4421.69s -> 4424.49s]  Here's what I don't get about this. I understand the whole, well, there's no sound
[4424.49s -> 4430.10s]  because the main character is hearing impaired, right? But he's, he's not here right now.
[4430.10s -> 4447.82s]  He's not currently here. I mean, he's over here. Why couldn't we just hear that? Ah, the old two
[4447.82s -> 4454.42s]  people holding a guy pretending to struggle bit and they're just barely putting their hands on
[4454.42s -> 4468.46s]  him. Yeah, get in there. Oh, this is so tough. He's wild. Oh, all right. Oh, I got a,
[4468.46s -> 4484.17s]  I got a wild one here too. Oh, that was hard. If I'm a director, I'm gonna be like,
[4484.17s -> 4487.37s]  I'm gonna go like, I'm gonna take, you know, the actors to the side and be like,
[4487.37s -> 4495.62s]  hey, listen, like you, like you can bite that guy for real and like try to bite him. And you
[4495.62s -> 4521.94s]  want like really want, I would be, I would, I would direct my actors. I don't understand what,
[4522.74s -> 4527.91s]  this is like the main selling point of the game is we just didn't add an audio track.
[4533.86s -> 4551.40s]  That's, that's the only thing that's, that's it. And you want to play it. I don't
[4551.40s -> 4559.75s]  want to play it, but, but we see things through on this channel, maybe like 30 or 40% of the time,
[4559.75s -> 4564.31s]  like, but we, we see three, we see things through on this channel, maybe like three
[4564.31s -> 4577.99s]  out of 10 times. So, sorry, I just kind of had to piss back here, but sorry, I startled you.
[4578.55s -> 4587.69s]  He'll finish this, but not LA D'more. LA D'more is like 60 hours. This is three.
[4588.33s -> 4612.18s]  This is punishment for the dab. I can't tell. Is this CG? No, this is, this is real,
[4612.18s -> 4621.93s]  right? Yeah. Okay. This is real. All right. We're almost ready for the pole. If he breaks the lamp,
[4621.93s -> 4633.85s]  I'll give a pull. Throw the lamp across the room and you get a pull. Uh, one of these tropes is
[4633.85s -> 4639.29s]  going to happen. He's going to notice something ridiculous. Turn around, grab, throw, shatter
[4639.29s -> 4647.30s]  against the wall. Then you get your pull. Wait, what did I say? If it was me, if it was me
[4647.30s -> 4671.29s]  doing this, that I had to finish it, right? Oh no. I did it. So I have to finish it.
[4675.46s -> 4746.10s]  Oh, he screams again. I'm remembering everything that happened. I broke that guy's arm.
[4746.10s -> 4755.38s]  I smashed a bottle. I got yelled at. I made direct awkward eye contact with another actor on
[4755.94s -> 4776.39s]  him. What am I done? What the hell are you doing? He's the bird. He's the bird. I have to beat the
[4776.39s -> 4790.14s]  game. He's the bird. I knew it. Yep. He's the bird. Okay. Well, no pole. Oh, it's over guys.
[4790.14s -> 4796.33s]  All right. No. Okay. All right. Here. Let me like, let me go back and like
[4797.45s -> 4813.38s]  rewrite this rule. That was just a dream. That might not be real. All right. If it was
[4813.38s -> 4829.85s]  just a dream, then rules are rules. See, it's okay. It was just a dream. That wasn't actually
[4829.85s -> 4834.18s]  real. Just because it was on camera doesn't mean it was real. Still get your pull.
[4846.07s -> 4856.65s]  Dream rules don't count. That's yeah, that's real. That's true. No, that's fine. Just because
[4856.65s -> 4865.19s]  it showed up in the game doesn't mean it actually happened. Face on. What do you mean
[4865.19s -> 4876.15s]  face on? Did he throw that out the window? Those are expensive. All of his personal data
[4876.15s -> 4899.13s]  is on there. He's punching the driver's seat. Yeah. He's going to fuck up his driver.
[4916.47s -> 4923.26s]  How long has it been? Have I been streaming for like five hours? No, not even two hours. Not
[4923.26s -> 4936.89s]  even an hour and a half. I feel like I'm sitting in this chair for a month. The game
[4936.89s -> 4948.57s]  actually has no sound. Oh yeah. That's not my configuration being wrong. You have 40 minutes
[4948.57s -> 4966.46s]  left to refund this. No, I want to be one of their only sales. What's the story again?
[4967.26s -> 4974.25s]  Good luck. I have no idea. Something about a guy. His mom was killed when he was younger
[4974.25s -> 4979.45s]  and it might have just been him that did it. And now he's, I don't know. I have no idea
[4979.45s -> 4986.62s]  what's happening because we weren't able to see. I can't, there's no subtitles and you
[4986.62s -> 4992.41s]  can't hear anything. So we're just supposed to be led to believe his dad is a cop. His dad
[4992.41s -> 4999.70s]  may have killed the mother and I have a friend that they got the sneakers stolen
[5001.10s -> 5024.50s]  by this guy. And then this guy went to jail and then, and then this, I don't know. Why would
[5024.50s -> 5030.12s]  you want to be one of the idiots that bought this and didn't refund it? I don't know. Part of
[5030.12s -> 5040.07s]  me thinks that's funny. I kind of think that's funny. Is it? It might be. I could, I could
[5040.07s -> 5050.55s]  look at my Steam library and be like, oh yeah, I remember that. This isn't $30. This is 15.
[5059.40s -> 5070.78s]  He's running away. Okay. It's not worth it. Well, I got, I have up until,
[5076.73s -> 5081.82s]  why would you want to remember that you played this for the Steam trading cards? Yeah. You'll
[5081.82s -> 5091.35s]  see in like five years, this will be worth like at least one or two Hearthstone packs.
[5091.35s -> 5103.53s]  You know what I mean? Trading the Quiet Man two main character cards for two refined metal.
[5103.53s -> 5113.61s]  No, that's going to be worth a lot of fucking money. Quiet Man was critically panned. What,
[5113.61s -> 5136.60s]  what are you guys doing with the complaints? Uh oh. Uh oh. They're copy pasting a review of
[5136.60s -> 5143.51s]  the game. This game is 39 gigs. Holy shit. It was, I was wondering why it took so long to
[5143.51s -> 5154.78s]  download. Why? Why is this game 40 gigs? What? Is it because of all the, the cut scenes? No
[5154.78s -> 5163.67s]  way. Yeah, it did take a long time to download. That's true. It has uncompressed audio. Come on
[5163.67s -> 5177.86s]  H.264, man. You ever like, I know this is, I'm speaking at it like total like arm chair here,
[5177.86s -> 5182.58s]  like arm chair dev. Like, you know, it's the Viad. But sometimes I really do think if I had
[5182.58s -> 5187.72s]  like $10 million or like $5 million, I think I could probably actually put a team together and
[5187.72s -> 5191.56s]  make something pretty good. I don't, maybe that's just me being an idiot and like lying.
[5191.56s -> 5203.78s]  I don't know. You ever, sometimes you feel that way? Everyone, everyone thinks that. Yeah,
[5203.78s -> 5210.54s]  I know. But like, sometimes I think it's real, but it's not because that's speaking from total
[5210.54s -> 5215.02s]  ignorance. If I had $5 million, I had to make a fun game. It's like, oh, would you? No,
[5215.02s -> 5217.74s]  I'd come up with, I would make, this is what I would make that. But that would, at least
[5217.74s -> 5226.79s]  I would put that in the game and I'd be proud of the spinning roundhouse kick. But then
[5226.79s -> 5230.31s]  you have to like bring yourself back to reality and be like, I, uh, I have no idea
[5230.31s -> 5234.09s]  what the fuck I'm doing. And there's no way it would be even remotely close to probably
[5234.17s -> 5238.33s]  as good as this game. Technically, like I would, it would be like a stick figure game,
[5238.33s -> 5244.17s]  but I would hire people. I bring in very talented people and I would, I would just
[5244.17s -> 5249.85s]  sit in a giant chair that oversaw the whole development team. And I'd have a big horn,
[5249.85s -> 5255.24s]  like a big bullhorn. And I'd be like, you're doing a good job down there.
[5256.39s -> 5272.89s]  You over at programming, excellent work. Like I would look over, I would see on the other
[5272.89s -> 5277.61s]  side, they'd be the, you know, the, the grass, the grass people, the grass team. Yeah,
[5277.61s -> 5287.22s]  I'd have a dedicated team of grass. You know, I took a tackle. Did I lose? No, I'm still alive.
[5289.46s -> 5294.26s]  Like the grass looks good over there. Good work. Maybe 2% longer blades.
[5294.98s -> 5302.70s]  And people would love me as their boss. Yeah, I would be so, I would be such a good boss.
[5303.34s -> 5311.86s]  I would throw parties. Like I would invite clowns to be birthday parties and I would
[5311.86s -> 5328.17s]  always have like fresh muffins and cookies for everybody. Oh, I died. Shit. And anytime
[5328.17s -> 5330.81s]  there was something I didn't like that was happening in the studio. Like if I looked over
[5330.81s -> 5337.53s]  at the team of, of, of grass blade designers and I was like, oh, that didn't look that good. I'd
[5337.53s -> 5344.73s]  be like, you're doing your best and I appreciate it. Take the next three days off. And then I
[5344.73s -> 5348.09s]  would just like get down off my giant chair and I'd sit at the computer and try to do it.
[5348.09s -> 5366.07s]  All right. Here's a fucking pole. Next three days off is fired. No, it's not. That's go
[5366.07s -> 5373.19s]  take a break and come back fresh. I would have fresh sandwiches every day. I would go,
[5373.19s -> 5378.12s]  I would go person to person, like seat to seat. And I would take a, Hey, what's your favorite?
[5378.12s -> 5383.74s]  What's your favorite sandwich? No, actually, uh, I really like a tomato basil mozzarella.
[5383.74s -> 5387.18s]  Is that like weird? No, no, no, that's fine. You're going to have it every day.
[5387.18s -> 5404.74s]  Okay. Hold on. Uh, finish this game. Come back fresh or don't come back at all. That's not
[5404.74s -> 5422.36s]  what I said. That's not what I said. All right. Here's your pole. I died. Take a look.
[5422.36s -> 5438.86s]  There you go. Come back. So you can design grass. Yeah. They would, they would be,
[5438.86s -> 5444.95s]  there'd be 2000 people on the dev team. And by this point I would have had,
[5444.95s -> 5448.07s]  I would have already been making, you know, I mean, my Twitch career is,
[5448.07s -> 5451.27s]  I mean, doing real good. So I'm saying probably another year or two, I'll have like
[5451.27s -> 5456.23s]  six or $700 million in the bank account. So I would just, I would have 2000 employees
[5456.87s -> 5461.19s]  each. There would be 10 employees dedicated to grass, 10 employees dedicated to the sky,
[5461.19s -> 5465.03s]  10 employees dedicated to food items that like modeling food items to put around.
[5473.14s -> 5488.55s]  New game plus has sound. This is difficult. Look at this split here. Fucking sandwiches.
[5489.19s -> 5492.62s]  Oh, the boss, like that, you have to scream at me though, because I'm,
[5492.62s -> 5496.86s]  I'm so high up in the, I'm in like a huge chair with a horn like boss.
[5497.82s -> 5503.42s]  Yeah. Tim, what is it? Tim valued employee, Tim, how are you? What can I get for you?
[5503.74s -> 5512.60s]  Hey, uh, can I have a lasagna? Absolutely. And I would fucking call like the nearest lasagna
[5512.60s -> 5522.98s]  company and would get it catered for him. Uh, it looks like, okay, whoa, this is still close.
[5536.63s -> 5543.29s]  Bankrupt in a week. And if somebody had a problem with like me or the company, I'd,
[5543.29s -> 5550.41s]  I would get off the chair and I'd be like, all right, uh, uh, Mike Davidson.
[5550.97s -> 5554.73s]  I, I know you've had it. You have a problem with something here. I, it's, I want you,
[5554.73s -> 5558.33s]  you, you get a day in the big chair. Then he gets to go up there and like sit up there
[5558.33s -> 5573.88s]  and like yell down about lasagnas to people and shit for 10 minutes. No, no, no, 10 minutes.
[5573.88s -> 5577.26s]  And then when he comes down, we've been like high five and they're like,
[5577.26s -> 5583.26s]  I would shake his hand and they'd be like $400. Like just 400 just in that handshake.
[5587.11s -> 5596.81s]  All right. I, I'm going to close this in like 60 seconds because this is so,
[5596.81s -> 5600.25s]  this is too close, but I'm going to close it because it has to happen.
[5600.25s -> 5618.76s]  This is the longest 60 seconds of my life. And the people that are making the grass,
[5618.76s -> 5625.94s]  let's bring this last point up before I close the poll. You know, uh, uh, Mr. Albertson.
[5625.94s -> 5630.66s]  Yeah, yes. Uh, I don't, I don't, I'm trying to get a feel for, I never like made grass
[5630.66s -> 5634.74s]  before. I've never really, I came from like a different team and I'd be like, absolutely.
[5635.62s -> 5639.70s]  Hold on a minute. I'd come down and I, we would eat grass together. I'd be like,
[5639.70s -> 5644.26s]  you want to try some? And like, we would eat it. I would eat it mostly. Uh, I'm a big, I love it.
[5644.26s -> 5648.18s]  So I would be, I would eat the grass in front of them and I would explain exactly how it tasted.
[5649.06s -> 5652.42s]  And I would be like, if you want to try, go for it. And I've given them microscopes.
[5652.42s -> 5655.96s]  They ever more, every single desk would have a microscope by the way.
[5655.96s -> 5658.84s]  So in case there was something you need more detail on, look through the
[5659.48s -> 5663.32s]  microscope for the blade grass. If you want to eat it, it'd be fine. Um,
[5668.87s -> 5674.63s]  all right. The poll is closed. I'm done. I'm out. Poll is closed. That's it. Nah,
[5674.63s -> 5686.89s]  it's over. By the way, guys, this is a telltale game. Choices don't matter.
[5687.77s -> 5713.86s]  I can't believe this got voted off. I can't believe it. What the hell? Everyone that said,
[5713.86s -> 5720.42s]  yes, keep playing. Fuck chat. No, I, uh, I can't do that. No, just one more guy,
[5720.42s -> 5724.55s]  one more enemy. Look, I told you I was going to stop. I didn't tell you when,
[5725.27s -> 5736.78s]  in like a minute. I would, okay. Can I play this like in the corner while we figure out
[5736.78s -> 5750.52s]  what else we're going to do? Like I may not have done what you wanted here,
[5750.52s -> 5753.72s]  but it's anybody down here wanted a lasagna. Anybody want a lasagna?
[5754.68s -> 5766.66s]  I'm willing to call. I'll get one. Me, me. What if everybody wants a lasagna? Well,
[5766.66s -> 5771.53s]  then I'm going to get a big lasagna. I'll get a big kiddie pool and they'll put it,
[5771.53s -> 5775.69s]  they'll just make a giant lasagna in the kiddie pool. It'll be lasagna day
[5775.69s -> 5778.33s]  and I'll jump in it and like roll around in it with like swimmies on.
[5787.99s -> 5793.11s]  All right. I'm leaving. I'm gone. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm almost gone.
[5793.11s -> 5801.45s]  Damn it. Hold on. Let me open up. I was going to,
[5801.45s -> 5803.77s]  I'm going to plan a couple of hitman missions that we have didn't do.
[5804.65s -> 5832.42s]  And this is going to take a second. I'm not going to break my computer.
[5833.06s -> 5853.58s]  If I crashed my computer, I'm going to be so sad. All right. Here it comes.
[5853.58s -> 5860.39s]  Let's get another game capture on here. What the fuck? The controller. I don't want rumble.
[5861.03s -> 5868.66s]  Nobody wants rumble. Nobody. This was a gimmick back in like the Nintendo 64 era.
[5871.18s -> 5877.88s]  Does anybody get immersed with rumble at this point? The controller shakes. That was cool.
[5878.68s -> 5891.70s]  Back in 2002. I mean, I like it. It's fun. Sometimes. Don't you wish food had a rumble
[5891.70s -> 5894.42s]  feature? So when you eat lasagna, it would like rumble to going down.
[5918.41s -> 5920.97s]  This is impossible. So I'm just going to delete.
