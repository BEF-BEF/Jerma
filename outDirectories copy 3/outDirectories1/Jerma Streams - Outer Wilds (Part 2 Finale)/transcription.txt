[1.02s -> 7.13s]  Hello, good afternoon, good morning, good evening, good afternoon, how, wherever you are.
[7.13s -> 11.37s]  Hey, in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
[11.37s -> 19.82s]  He took so long to TP back. Uh, a lot of people are not gonna know what you're talking about by that.
[23.00s -> 30.46s]  We had an extensive pre-stream chat earlier, talking extensively about the idea of, uh,
[30.46s -> 34.70s]  of having a teleport power. This is why you don't want to miss the pre-stream chats.
[35.34s -> 49.35s]  You're gonna wink? Already? Right now? All right, hold on. Redeem that in just a second. I'm not ready.
[50.31s -> 62.28s]  Hold on, I'm actually not ready to do that. That wasn't scammed. I just did it.
[73.59s -> 82.47s]  Keep your cam on. I love, love, love, love your haircut. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[85.78s -> 92.34s]  Does it really have to be 75,000 Pepehands? Well, yeah, otherwise the whole stream would be
[92.34s -> 96.74s]  winks and I'm like, I don't want to do that. I might just, oh, god damn it, I bumped you.
[97.54s -> 103.56s]  I might get rid of winks in like a month or two. I don't know. I might like delete winks
[103.56s -> 109.51s]  and we might change it to something else. Hello? There's always going to be a 75,000 point tier,
[110.15s -> 114.23s]  but I might change it to like something. I don't know. We got to freshen it up a little bit.
[114.95s -> 122.26s]  I'm saving it for the net. We'll just save it then. I don't know. Every few months,
[122.26s -> 127.46s]  we'll make the 75,000 point thing be something different. That's the idea. Anyways, we're going
[127.46s -> 134.87s]  to try to finish Out of Wilds today. If you missed it, we just, I started it yesterday. It's
[135.51s -> 140.63s]  got me interested. It's a really fun, interesting game. And I think it's, I think we got another
[140.63s -> 149.35s]  like six to seven hours in the game. We should be able to do it. And I was here. I was going to
[149.35s -> 156.23s]  start in like 45 minutes, but I'm here and I'm ready. I've eaten. I had two, that's right,
[156.23s -> 164.73s]  two baby food pouches. That's not a lie. Those of you that want advice. Hey, I got any advice to
[164.73s -> 170.01s]  like, how do you get like streaming advice, right? Hey, I'm starting a channel. What's, what, what,
[170.01s -> 179.05s]  what do I do? Baby food pouches. I'm serious. It's incredibly fast. It keeps you going. It's
[179.05s -> 184.73s]  a quick snack you can have in the middle. Like I go downstairs and pee. And during those breaks,
[184.73s -> 190.09s]  sometimes I'll just grab one of those little baby food like on the go packs and just there it goes.
[190.97s -> 195.99s]  It's like apple, bananas and strawberries. It's got like a little bit of protein. That's
[195.99s -> 205.24s]  that's not bad. Here's your streamer advice. Like, man, when I want to do like these five,
[205.24s -> 212.34s]  six, seven plus hour long broadcasts, I did. There you go. Get baby food packets and eat them
[212.34s -> 221.46s]  when you take a break. That's not that weird. It's just a, that's a, that's like one of those
[221.46s -> 227.62s]  secret tips that no streamers will tell you. All streamers eat baby food. They just don't want you
[227.62s -> 239.58s]  to know. Okay. Let's be clear. You're regressing a little, but we're going to finish Outer Wilds
[239.58s -> 248.06s]  tonight or try to. And then tomorrow I will probably have my Xbox 360 hard drive. We're
[248.06s -> 256.65s]  going to do Tony Hawk's underground. And the next day Diablo two hardcore and maybe Assur's
[256.65s -> 269.53s]  wrath DLC. Maybe it depends on how much I play Diablo two. I also have trying this. I've got this
[269.53s -> 278.22s]  thing on today. I've got this back and rib and stomach brace on today. Trying to take it. It
[278.22s -> 283.05s]  feels pretty good. Actually. I actually feel pretty good. It's wrapped around. Show it. I mean,
[283.05s -> 290.39s]  I don't think I really can. Hold on. Can you see it's like wrapped around my shoulders?
[291.83s -> 295.99s]  I have to like, I guess it's probably worth addressing right now because people are just
[295.99s -> 303.51s]  going to think I'm wearing a backpack. You see, dude, why are you wearing a backpack right now?
[304.47s -> 312.12s]  Uh, because I'm going to school. Okay. There you go. It's on here. It wraps around. It pulls me
[312.12s -> 319.34s]  back. It, there's one, there's like a thing that goes around my stomach too. He's an, an omega
[319.34s -> 332.09s]  gamer. Why do you look like a different guy? What? Why do you look like a different guy?
[332.65s -> 347.38s]  Hold on. What do you mean? I look like a different guy? No, I don't. Why do you look like a different
[347.38s -> 354.47s]  guy? It's, it's me, right? Is this me? No, it's because like the light and the shadows and stuff.
[356.31s -> 359.99s]  This, this eye over here is like fully in shadow and it's like fucking up your vision.
[361.40s -> 370.23s]  Why do you look like a different guy? Hold on. Let me, let, hold on. Let me, let me quell your
[370.23s -> 379.46s]  fears here. Okay. Here you go. This is what you were used to. Am I, am I a different guy today?
[382.58s -> 386.58s]  That's better. That's better. Okay. That's better. Now you're, now you're the guy that was here
[386.58s -> 392.58s]  yesterday. The colors in your room changed. It could be anybody. I got a lot of looks too,
[392.58s -> 396.82s]  by the way. People that say, oh man, you look different today. I got like, I, I could probably
[396.82s -> 414.60s]  be like four or five different people. I really could. Anyways, out of wilds. Let's go. What's
[414.60s -> 430.20s]  the last thing we did? You're, this, this streamer is delusional. What, what, how, how am I delusional?
[433.08s -> 445.43s]  What did I say? Dude, quick comet jump joke. No. Oh, okay. I was unraveling the mystery.
[446.39s -> 452.39s]  This is the best fucking game, mate. Best fucking game. I mean, it's pretty good. It's really, I,
[452.39s -> 456.55s]  I have to hold, I don't, I, I'm interested in the story. Okay. Those of you that didn't see
[456.55s -> 460.15s]  yesterday and you liked this game and you're like, well, what the hell has he done so far?
[460.15s -> 466.63s]  This, this is what I've done so far. Uh, I was going to go, where was I going to go first?
[466.63s -> 474.68s]  A hanging city. No. Found a cave with an anglerfish fossil inside, but the opening is only big enough
[474.68s -> 481.64s]  for my scout. All right. This part of the escape pods and shit, the comet. No, no, no, no. I want
[481.64s -> 489.98s]  to do this. The, the Nomai crafted warp cores at the black hole forge. All right. Where's the black
[489.98s -> 501.34s]  hole forge? Is it in the black hole? We also didn't even find this person. Al says Gabro went to
[501.34s -> 504.94s]  Giants deep to try to learn more about the Nomai statue. All right. I kind of have to, this is
[504.94s -> 509.82s]  like a tutorial quest. I kind of have to do that. All right. We're going to go try to find that guy
[509.82s -> 521.70s]  on Giants deep. You going to work? See you in four hours. See you in four hours. Hopefully you
[521.70s -> 537.62s]  don't miss the first sun joke of the night. Don't worry. You won't. Okay. Let's go up Giants deep.
[542.47s -> 548.18s]  I want, wait, is he going to miss the first joke or the first sun joke? Well, he's going to miss
[548.18s -> 563.02s]  the first room of the evening and that's more arguably way more important. Oh, sun crash joke
[563.02s -> 571.99s]  incoming. Here it comes. All right. Slow down. Slow down. This, I get my, this is what people
[571.99s -> 576.95s]  were saying last time. They're like, dude, please don't fly 300 meters a second into planets.
[578.31s -> 586.68s]  I know, but I just, I know, but look, it's not even moving. Space doesn't make any sense. Look,
[586.68s -> 596.26s]  I'm not even moving right now. You're going too slow. What, what, okay. What would you guys say
[596.26s -> 603.40s]  is a safe speed to go towards a planet? 150, 200 meters. Well, what, what is like the, what's like
[603.40s -> 610.06s]  the, I could get a speeding ticket. What's the, don't go over like sex 65 70s. You're going to
[610.06s -> 621.00s]  get into speeding ticket. What would it be? 300 250. All right. So this is a safe speed. Yeah.
[621.00s -> 628.46s]  That's that. This, this seems normal. Let's try to find this guy. Speeding ticket is 800 meters a
[628.46s -> 638.12s]  second near constellation. Okay. Well that's good to know. That's my skincare routine. Uh, hold on.
[638.52s -> 652.76s]  I even, okay, we're good. Uh, my skincare routine is in shower, close eyes, push face into running
[652.76s -> 661.10s]  water from shower head and squint and close my eyes and then rub my face. And then when I get out,
[662.26s -> 666.66s]  more importantly, I moisturize every day. That's the thing. That's a problem. A lot of people have,
[667.62s -> 671.86s]  they'll say like, Hey, I got any skincare tips. Yeah. Moisturize your face. Moisturize your face
[672.66s -> 688.20s]  every day. What is over here? Have I been over here? Yeah, I did this already. All right. I did
[688.20s -> 701.30s]  that already. Is there another spot to go? What's this one? Uh, did I do this yet? I think I did.
[701.30s -> 705.78s]  Yep. I climbed up there. That's where the, where else have I not been on this island?
[707.67s -> 719.59s]  Oops. Gabbro. Hold on. Wait, what is this? In the water? Is he in the water? I think he might be in
[719.59s -> 730.44s]  the water. Can the ship go in the water? Yeah, I can. All right. The ship can go in the water.
[736.66s -> 755.35s]  Uh, am I going forward? Am I in the water? Okay. That was weird. I don't think I can move in the
[755.35s -> 760.86s]  water. All right. Gabbro is definitely down here somewhere. I'm just going to skim the water and
[760.86s -> 767.24s]  find him. He's playing some kind of flute or something. Wait, there we go. There he is.
[768.04s -> 775.27s]  Hold on. Did you buy this on the Epic store? Uh, I think that's the only place you can get it.
[775.99s -> 781.24s]  There he is. All right. Found him. All right. I'm going to do this tutorial quest.
[781.88s -> 786.60s]  Oh fuck. Slow down. Oh my God. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt.
[787.56s -> 793.75s]  You ever place a land up here? Imagine looking over like up over your shoulder right now.
[807.37s -> 812.50s]  All right. Is there, there's no landing pad here. Oh wait, I can go this way.
[813.06s -> 817.70s]  All right. There's a spot I can climb up there. All right. Fuck it. Let's go.
[822.10s -> 835.88s]  We're safe. Kind of. Here we go. Unidentified signal nearby.
[836.84s -> 842.20s]  Is he up? There's ghost and shit in here. That's the ghost. Yep. All right. Hold on.
[843.24s -> 856.50s]  Wait, he was right there. I didn't know that that was somebody in that. I didn't know somebody was
[856.50s -> 861.67s]  in that. I didn't have my flashlight on and the water was on my face. All right. Let's go.
[862.39s -> 866.90s]  Nice. It's you. Good to see you made it in here in one piece. The first solo launch is a doozy,
[866.90s -> 871.62s]  isn't it? They don't freak out or anything, but lately I keep like dying repeatedly. I don't wait.
[871.62s -> 882.34s]  You're dying too? You're, you're dying too. What about you? Have you died lately? No, it's me too.
[882.34s -> 887.56s]  We're in a time loop. Time has been behaving unusually lately. Yeah, time loop makes sense.
[887.56s -> 895.27s]  Cool. You're taking this pretty well. Right back at you. Personally, I like the new experiences
[895.83s -> 899.35s]  and I've never been in a time loop before. I mean, I don't think I've been in a time loop
[899.35s -> 904.79s]  for this one. It looks like you and I are the only ones who can tell that time's gone all weird.
[905.91s -> 909.99s]  I tried radioing Hornfels and asking if they died too, but they thought I was being metaphorical.
[923.98s -> 928.14s]  He's not as concerned about this as he could be. What if he's going to land and smash his head on
[928.14s -> 933.03s]  a rock? He's going to land and smash his head on this rock. Or should I tell him to stop playing
[933.03s -> 946.02s]  the flute? Have you ever watched a cyclone for so long it started to hypnotize you? I'm telling you,
[946.02s -> 953.00s]  they'll put you in a trance if you stare at them too long. How's space treating you? I found
[953.00s -> 959.35s]  something. What'd you find? I reached inside the Statue Island. So the Nomai created those head
[959.35s -> 965.86s]  statues to record memories, huh? Yeah, I could see the Nomai doing that. Not sure for what for,
[965.86s -> 970.66s]  but it seems like their sort of thing. You think the statues are recording our memories? I'm just
[970.66s -> 976.18s]  holding my eyes open underwater too. My eye's probably burning. You think the statues are
[976.18s -> 981.38s]  recording our memories then, because I remember that one on the bleach beach looked at me funny.
[982.18s -> 995.59s]  That must be my memory friend. I found something. I found what happened to the orbital probe cannon.
[996.47s -> 999.03s]  That's the cannon breaking apart at the start of each time loop, for real?
[999.67s -> 1005.99s]  Did you figure out why? Too much power. Kind of scary how much that sounds like something
[1005.99s -> 1010.39s]  Slate or Feldspar would do. I'm pretty surprised the Nomai built something that actually broke.
[1011.03s -> 1015.43s]  Come to think of it, broke might be the wrong word, because it looks like the orbital probe
[1015.43s -> 1023.18s]  cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each loop. So why just you and I
[1023.18s -> 1029.59s]  are having a time loop? All right, well give me a tip. Something you might like. At the start of
[1029.59s -> 1034.79s]  every time loop, I keep seeing a bright flash in the sky at the start of every loop. Something must
[1034.79s -> 1040.74s]  be happening up there in orbit around the planet. What else? What else? Have you been to the Statue
[1040.74s -> 1044.42s]  Island? That's what I've been calling it. Seeing as it's the island where I found the glowing
[1044.42s -> 1050.74s]  Nomai statue. Get it? I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened.
[1051.30s -> 1055.06s]  By the way, it's a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid seven out of ten
[1055.06s -> 1060.31s]  on the Gabriel relaxation skill. If you like checking out Statue Island, it's the one with
[1060.31s -> 1067.74s]  two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Pretty good, isn't it? Well, mostly connected,
[1067.74s -> 1075.66s]  isn't it? The way you'll see. Your ship. Definitely on this planet somewhere. I mean,
[1075.66s -> 1078.62s]  unless a cyclone came by, toss it into space. That would be pretty nuts.
[1079.66s -> 1087.38s]  Hope it's not a lone one. We kind of already had that info, but at least I found Gabro.
[1088.10s -> 1102.20s]  Hold on. I have to adjust my fucking body belt. There we go. That's better. All right, cool.
[1103.08s -> 1113.03s]  Geo incoming. All right, so I know. Let me go put this in just to have it done.
[1113.75s -> 1128.70s]  Here we are. Get this away. We've completed it. So Gabro goes this way and this goes. All right,
[1128.70s -> 1139.10s]  cool. So this has been completed now. We have a full connection to this brain, but this is
[1139.10s -> 1144.44s]  almost all done. This whole side is almost done. Unless there's something, nothing's connecting
[1144.44s -> 1156.73s]  from here. This is almost completed over here. Okay. What have I not found over here? Sixth
[1156.73s -> 1167.22s]  location. Right. I remember I was all fucked up on that. I don't know. Does he have any more info
[1167.22s -> 1181.16s]  for me? What do you got? What are you doing out here? Well, what are any of us doing? Really?
[1181.16s -> 1188.28s]  No, I'm just kidding. I'm out here exploring the solar system. I'll tell you what. Really
[1188.28s -> 1194.89s]  room to think. It's a quiet and peaceful out here. My ADHD is satisfied. He's usually quiet.
[1194.89s -> 1198.25s]  Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my island. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How's space treating you? Where
[1198.25s -> 1207.13s]  should I explore? What's up with this planet? I know, right? That was just Yoshi. Oh, you mean
[1207.13s -> 1212.17s]  like tell you more about it. I got you. Well, Giants Deep is a massive, mostly water. No surprises
[1212.17s -> 1216.49s]  there. There's a strong current a ways beneath the surface. Oh, I got to go into the surface. I
[1216.49s -> 1220.87s]  got to go into the... All right. I know where I'm going. I tried everything I could think to get
[1220.87s -> 1235.34s]  past that current and neither idea worked. The land masses I've found. All right. Cool. I didn't
[1235.34s -> 1245.77s]  skip the lore. It skipped it for me. It deleted me from the conversation. Trying to like take his
[1245.77s -> 1262.94s]  spot. Screen. Okay. Oh, what's up with this planet? Let's see it again. Let's try everything. As for
[1262.94s -> 1267.66s]  land masses. Yeah. Yeah. You've seen the cyclones. Yeah. They're hard to miss. They'll toss up
[1267.66s -> 1271.74s]  everything in path. Islands included. You get picked up trying to land in water. It's not going
[1271.74s -> 1285.11s]  to kill you. Okay. Beautiful. The ships don't fucking... I have to get this out of the water.
[1285.11s -> 1296.57s]  What did that do for me? But there was... Oh, yep. Okay. The ocean depths. The Nomai on the construction
[1296.57s -> 1302.57s]  here saw something sink beneath the underwater current. All right. I'm going for it. Let's see
[1302.57s -> 1310.71s]  if I can go down there. There's something under the water. Exit ship to repair. Oh, wait. Hold on.
[1314.23s -> 1318.97s]  Is this one of those shards in here? Remember? Like here. Look. There's a quantum fluctuation
[1318.97s -> 1327.14s]  down in the middle of the earth here. In earth. You know what I'm talking about. This way.
[1327.86s -> 1338.57s]  There it is. Okay. It's inside the center. Can I just try to swim? All right. I'm going. You know,
[1338.57s -> 1344.63s]  I'm going for it. I'm just going to go for it. You know, you got to... What the hell is that?
[1345.19s -> 1348.89s]  You got to go for it. I'm just going to... I'm going for it. You know what I'm saying?
[1349.61s -> 1363.30s]  Why am I stuck? Okay. Do I have a fuel? Look. I'm dead anyways. Okay. Here we go.
[1365.86s -> 1378.17s]  Sink to the bottom. Okay. So this is the current. Wait. I was inside of this thing.
[1379.37s -> 1383.37s]  I was inside of that. Remember like the electricity? I was inside of this.
[1383.37s -> 1400.42s]  I was in there. I was inside of that. Okay. Hold on. How do I get in there? What's up here?
[1407.11s -> 1415.43s]  Ship's gone. It's all right. I get a new one every day. Is this in the cyclone?
[1420.68s -> 1428.36s]  Dude, this thing is inside the cyclone. Oh, in? I don't think I can get in here.
[1429.08s -> 1443.16s]  The current's too strong. I'm trying to go underneath it. I can't like push my body down.
[1443.72s -> 1456.15s]  Let's see. Why the shipment? I couldn't... The ship sunk all the way to the bottom of the ocean. So
[1456.55s -> 1466.10s]  why the shipment? I can't move the ship down under water. I thought. I tried to do that earlier.
[1466.10s -> 1486.50s]  Did it not? I thought it didn't work. Let's go get the ship. Wait. Am I just sinking?
[1488.78s -> 1503.29s]  It's so hard to tell even if I'm moving or not. I guess I'm going down. Am I? What? This is going
[1503.29s -> 1522.66s]  further away. I'm going to go... I'm going to try to get the ship. Check the tornadoes. Yeah. I mean I
[1524.15s -> 1530.31s]  I know. I know. I'm just saying like it's besides that lower left indicator. It's like kind of
[1530.31s -> 1548.22s]  hard to know even what direction I'm facing. Where the fuck is this thing going? Can I like
[1548.22s -> 1557.48s]  turn this thing off? That's probably what's doing it. The ship is just gone. It just keeps going
[1557.48s -> 1574.41s]  further and further away. The ship is now leaving. It's like trying to get away from me. The sun's
[1574.41s -> 1584.20s]  about to explode. All I did was talk to the fucking guy on the beach. Which way is the
[1584.20s -> 1605.69s]  current going? Where is it going? Hard to see. This way? Forward? Am I moving with the current
[1605.69s -> 1619.59s]  right now? I don't know. I guess. I mean I look at the globe. I'm moving. I guess I'm moving.
[1622.58s -> 1625.86s]  Well, whatever. I'm going to see if I can go in there with the ship.
[1626.50s -> 1650.81s]  The sun's about to explode, so it doesn't matter. Hello? Where the hell? Where did I just go?
[1651.61s -> 1661.37s]  Through one of the tornadoes, I guess? And then out of the planet? This is a black hole?
[1662.33s -> 1670.36s]  That was weird. Well, I'm just going to try this again. The ship is now leaving.
[1670.36s -> 1701.16s]  Well, the only new info I got was that I got to go into the bottom of that planet.
[1711.00s -> 1715.72s]  Dude, please stop the supernova joke. I can't, man. It gets laughs every time.
[1718.71s -> 1730.17s]  You guys, if something's working, you got to keep doing it. Okay. Let me see if there's
[1730.17s -> 1740.65s]  anything else I could do. Black hole forge. I still haven't done the sun station, which was
[1740.65s -> 1747.74s]  in... Remember I freaked out yesterday? The high energy lab in the canyon at Ember Twins equator.
[1747.74s -> 1757.78s]  I still haven't done that. White hole station. Strange warp dog just... Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then
[1757.78s -> 1773.29s]  high energy lab in the canyon at the Ember Twins equator. I feel like I've tried to go find that
[1773.53s -> 1778.25s]  five times and every time I get distracted and go, what's this over there? I'm going to try that.
[1778.25s -> 1800.82s]  In the canyon. There's a lab in the canyon. I'm going to try that. It's the moon. Let's
[1800.82s -> 1809.80s]  make progress now. Progress, progress, progress, progress. You have to remember the rule of the
[1809.80s -> 1815.00s]  sixth location. I don't even know what the rule is. I don't think I figured that out yet.
[1816.20s -> 1843.86s]  All right. Don't get a speeding ticket. In the canyon. There's a lab in the canyon.
[1846.06s -> 1851.90s]  Okay. Where like the cream and the cookie goes, that's the canyon, right? Make sure I like,
[1851.90s -> 1875.43s]  I get this figured out. Apparently going too fast again. I'm fine. So it's... Just get out.
[1876.95s -> 1894.17s]  Hello? What's going on? Where am I? Why do I only see white spots? I couldn't move. I couldn't
[1894.17s -> 1900.73s]  fucking move. Did I get out right when the dust storm landed on top of the ship? Hold on. I got
[1900.73s -> 1905.05s]  out of the... I got out of the tank when the sand was touching across the ship.
[1913.37s -> 1923.64s]  Got buried in sand like Minecraft. Okay. Again, I went too fast. You know what my biggest problem
[1923.64s -> 1931.38s]  with me in this game is? Traveling to each... Like traveling from here to a... Like where's my
[1931.38s -> 1938.30s]  teleport? I can only teleport to die and teleport back here. Why can I not die and teleport back
[1938.30s -> 1945.11s]  somewhere else? Where's my memory stone? Like I just want to go where I want to go and not fly.
[1947.18s -> 1978.73s]  Space. What is this? A space game? Immersion. What is this? Space or something? Let's try this again.
[1991.18s -> 1999.88s]  All right. I'm going to coast in, captain. Right into the fucking creamy center. That's where all
[1999.88s -> 2023.78s]  the good stuff is. What are you going to wink? That was fake? Fuck. Whatever. I don't see
[2024.66s -> 2040.26s]  what could be a lab. You know what I'm saying? Like what's this secret lab? Oh fuck. Watch it.
[2040.26s -> 2043.62s]  Watch it. Watch it. Watch out. Watch out for the giant death Minecraft trap.
[2044.42s -> 2057.35s]  I'm just gonna land and I'll figure it out. Okay. I got turned around there
[2058.07s -> 2069.45s]  because down is up and up is down right now. Let's see if we can get out. Okay. Here we are.
[2069.45s -> 2084.49s]  The canyon. Lab. Secret lab in the canyon. I've been in here. It's not there though.
[2096.82s -> 2101.46s]  This is... Is it... Did I just find it? Did I just find it? I think I just found it.
[2102.02s -> 2113.90s]  This is like a weird staircase. I think I found it. This is it?
[2115.58s -> 2125.37s]  Secret lab? No. I've already been here. I think. Right? Haven't I?
[2127.69s -> 2134.71s]  Holy fucking pog stairs. I think I've been here already. There's this weird thing here.
[2135.43s -> 2162.33s]  It seems like I could teleport from that. What's that? Okay. There's like a little bridge here.
[2165.43s -> 2170.55s]  All right. Wait. Wait for the Minecraft reefer to get the fuck out of the way.
[2173.85s -> 2181.85s]  What's this? Have I been in here? No, I haven't. Found the secret lab.
[2185.02s -> 2189.02s]  This door will need to remain closed for some time. I and I are running an experiment based
[2189.02s -> 2195.66s]  on the extraordinary findings from the white hole station. Remy and I will be running this
[2195.66s -> 2200.70s]  experiment until one of us, specifically me, can prove the other wrong. So although it's inconvenient,
[2200.70s -> 2204.62s]  the lab currently can only be accessed by the path from the sunless city.
[2205.98s -> 2212.33s]  The lab can only be accessed by the path from the sunless city. Inviting sand inside would
[2212.33s -> 2217.29s]  disrupt our setup and could have enormous consequences. If you realize this, it's an
[2217.29s -> 2224.63s]  extremely... But the door must remain closed. An update. The high energy lab is now being
[2224.63s -> 2229.27s]  used to design the Ash Twin project. If you're here to help or even just to observe, be sure
[2229.27s -> 2240.82s]  to use the sunless city path to the lab. Info. Bingo. High energy lab. Bingo. There's our dark
[2240.82s -> 2247.30s]  souls shortcut that we can open eventually. All right. Sunless city. Where's that? I gotta
[2247.30s -> 2253.14s]  go look that. I gotta go look that up on my little thing. And I gotta get in there. All right. Sunless
[2253.14s -> 2260.74s]  city. I need my ship. I don't know where I am. I've been there once, but I don't know where that is.
[2264.62s -> 2277.77s]  Ow. I just broke my teeth. Wait. Ow. I need one of those little block things. Is there one of
[2277.77s -> 2292.09s]  those lying around? I don't see one. Slapstick in space. I don't see one lying... I have to carry
[2292.09s -> 2299.58s]  one over here? All right. Well, I got that info. I love getting fucking info. This is a space game.
[2302.60s -> 2340.63s]  Dumb. Wait, what? Sunless city. Oh shit. This is the sunless city. You live right here. Ghost.
[2340.63s -> 2349.42s]  I just broke... What did I just do? What? No, I wanted to read that. What did that sign say?
[2349.42s -> 2365.61s]  Read it quick. Well, I can still can. Crash site caves. Uh, I can't go in here. Sunless city. How
[2365.61s -> 2377.19s]  do I get in here? How do you clear out a ghost? How do you clear a ghost? I have to go in here.
[2377.91s -> 2407.03s]  There's like 10 in here. Okay, that looks like it's going down, not up. How do I go this way?
[2407.83s -> 2427.37s]  And like the other side? I've been in the sunless city before. Yeah, but not this direction.
[2428.41s -> 2443.11s]  It seems like a way I can get in from here. You were in the sunless city before. Yeah, I just
[2443.11s -> 2450.84s]  don't remember where or how I got in there. Uh, I'm gonna die if I don't go to my ship.
[2456.38s -> 2460.30s]  It's hard to remember every location I've been to when all you do in this game is
[2460.30s -> 2482.70s]  find new locations. It was fine. How do I repair the ship from outside? Do I have to be outside the
[2482.70s -> 2490.73s]  ship? Do I have to do anything? Do I have to repair it? Or is it just repair it?
[2495.83s -> 2501.43s]  My reactor core is like broken, isn't it? All right, let me go back over there.
[2502.07s -> 2528.71s]  Let me just take... Let me browse. I just want to browse this canyon. It's just window shopping.
[2528.71s -> 2537.64s]  Is there anything else I didn't do here? Like, what the hell is this? It's like that bridge.
[2548.38s -> 2562.87s]  What's happening? Did I get stuck on? All right, hold on. Tilt this way. Was this where I was before?
[2565.48s -> 2571.80s]  It's inside. You're gonna navigate inside the caves and shit, right? I think it is in here.
[2578.33s -> 2594.71s]  Get out. If I remember, this is one of the ways to get in here. We got... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay,
[2594.71s -> 2609.53s]  I remember this. So is it up? Is it up or maybe... I don't know. Let me try going up.
[2610.25s -> 2626.25s]  Have I been here? This is where... Okay, this is the quantum cactus place. I think I've been here
[2626.25s -> 2633.13s]  already. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've seen this before. There's a rock in the cave here. Like, bed cave.
[2633.13s -> 2637.21s]  Yeah, I've seen this already. This is like, please, if you can help. My... Somebody's missing. Yep.
[2637.21s -> 2666.92s]  All right. Hi. Can I go down here? I mean, that's like a Mortal Kombat stage. I don't... No,
[2666.92s -> 2696.50s]  that's death. I can't go down there. But this bridge, it's back there. Let me just check if
[2696.66s -> 2702.94s]  nothing is over there. No, no, no. I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go deeper into the cave.
[2703.98s -> 2729.86s]  I might be out of time, though. Sand is coming. Sand is arising. All right. Okay, bring it back.
[2730.42s -> 2761.42s]  Come on, quantum. It wasn't this one. It was one more. In. Oh, one more. I gotta find this entrance
[2761.42s -> 2768.04s]  from here. How much boxes do I have? Yeah, friends find any sign. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's go.
[2768.04s -> 2775.93s]  So, now I'm in the cave system. It's just a question of where the hell do I get through
[2775.93s -> 2795.40s]  the Sunless City? What is this? No. Damn it. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. The nougat.
[2795.40s -> 2819.29s]  All right. I missed. Okay, good. Let's go up. Looking for... Before the music starts to play
[2819.29s -> 2825.91s]  and I run out of oxygen, I have to find this entrance to the Sunless City. It's not here.
[2825.91s -> 2856.74s]  I don't think it's here. Damn it. I'm reading chat. Let me try this one more time.
[2860.04s -> 2870.15s]  I'm in the rock. Oh, crack. Crack. Crack. Dude, I'm just browsing around Twitch and I'm
[2871.03s -> 2880.25s]  looking for a guy that's on crack every day. Am I in the right place? Yep. Yeah, I've already
[2880.25s -> 2887.10s]  been in here. This rock only goes to three places. We've already done this part. Unless it's like I
[2887.10s -> 2909.35s]  can't get out of here, right? Is this... I was here already. This is the place with the text,
[2909.35s -> 2925.42s]  the original one. One, two, three, one. Wait. How curious. This rock took me to a new location.
[2925.42s -> 2930.39s]  I wonder why this happened. Curious but also alarming. This new cave appears to lack an
[2930.39s -> 2944.41s]  entrance or exit. Wait, no. I was already here. I already did this. How many locations are there
[2944.41s -> 2969.00s]  actually? Okay, come on. Quantum. Come on. Quantum. Quantum. Quantum. Quantum. Quick. Quantum. Quick.
[2969.00s -> 2997.78s]  Quantum. Quick. Quantum. Quick. Quantum. I'm going out on my own terms. I'm just going to open one
[2997.78s -> 3023.67s]  eye and just wait and look straight in the air. This is just an old 80s movie. I can see the
[3023.67s -> 3032.58s]  laser beam coming. Is it going to kill me? Right in the eye. Where do I die from first? Oxygen or
[3032.58s -> 3051.48s]  crushed head? What do I do? Tyler wants to interview you. What do you mean interview?
[3053.08s -> 3059.54s]  All right, let's go. What do you want to know? What do you want to know? What do you got?
[3059.54s -> 3070.36s]  It all started when I was eight. I saw a movie for the first time and I was like,
[3070.36s -> 3075.66s]  that's what I want to do. That's what I'm thinking of. It was Ghostbusters 1.
[3076.22s -> 3091.24s]  That's the Valve, the Valve News Network. Oh, shit. Oh, I don't know why for a second I thought you
[3091.24s -> 3099.37s]  talked about like somebody in chat named Tyler wanted to interview me right now. Like, hey,
[3099.37s -> 3108.01s]  I want to interview you. Okay. Yeah, when you want to. Yeah, let's do it. That sounds fun.
[3109.02s -> 3114.46s]  What do you want to interview me about? Please have it be what my favorite fucking restaurant
[3114.46s -> 3127.43s]  in Vegas is. Yeah, I'll do that. Sounds fun. Just really important though. I only do 22
[3127.43s -> 3147.42s]  minute interviews. I'm a very busy man. Ego fucking maniac. No, I do whatever. Hit me up on a.
[3148.38s -> 3153.34s]  All right, you know what? Here, hit up one of the mods so I can get your like contact info
[3153.34s -> 3166.47s]  through like discord and we'll talk. No, no shitty jokes aside. Sounds like fun. I still
[3166.47s -> 3176.39s]  can't fucking do this. All right. This is more to explore in the ash twin towers.
[3179.59s -> 3183.90s]  All right, I'm gonna. But I already know that this is somewhere
[3185.50s -> 3189.58s]  half from the sunless city. I need to get to the sunless city. I don't know how to get to the sunless
[3189.58s -> 3199.61s]  city. Sun station. No, I'm not going for sun station again. That's an embarrassment.
[3200.25s -> 3204.86s]  You will be embarrassed for me. You know, people go like, oh, what's that thing when you're like
[3204.86s -> 3208.14s]  embarrassed for somebody else? It's not you doing it. That's what you're going to have.
[3208.94s -> 3217.22s]  I don't want to do that. What's it called? Like shot? What's it called? No, no, no. It's called
[3217.22s -> 3227.08s]  something. It actually has like, it has like a scientific name. Schadenfreude. Schadenfreude.
[3227.08s -> 3236.65s]  Yes, but that's not it. That's laughing at somebody else's expense. No, that's wrong. It has,
[3236.73s -> 3251.80s]  it has a name. It's Franscham. Franscham. Yeah, there you go. Somebody got it. It's like, it's
[3251.80s -> 3259.91s]  like Franscham, right? Franscham. Franscham. How do I say? No, that's, that's actually correct.
[3259.91s -> 3267.82s]  You actually have that correct. It's like Franscham. Yes. People are spelling it. However
[3267.82s -> 3275.34s]  you say it. That's, that's actually what it's called. I didn't make that up. I didn't make that
[3275.34s -> 3284.31s]  up. That's the term. I knew there was a term for it. I don't know how to pronounce it. It's German.
[3284.31s -> 3293.11s]  Yeah. I think I said it kind of close. Made it up. I'm going a thousand miles per hour.
[3293.99s -> 3301.30s]  This happens when I'm arguing about something and I'm holding the left stick up.
[3301.94s -> 3318.26s]  It's not Imperial. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all I know. Okay. You can make fun of me all
[3318.26s -> 3324.41s]  you want, but it's, it's what I know. I'm going to drive into the sun. First sun joke of the night.
[3324.41s -> 3329.93s]  Here it comes. Everyone's been waiting for it. Here it is. The first laugh out loud. He went
[3329.93s -> 3346.89s]  into the sun joke to explore the tower on the ashtray. First dark wood trap. Yeah. Coming up.
[3349.03s -> 3353.21s]  Okay. There's more to explore on this like right here, for instance,
[3353.85s -> 3364.02s]  but in hot 25 meters per second, five meters per second landing activated. Perfect landing.
[3364.82s -> 3374.46s]  Get out, get out. You stupid. All right. What do we got? We have this big power. I was going
[3374.46s -> 3378.70s]  to say 5g, but it's very easy joke to make and people would probably not think it was funny. So
[3378.70s -> 3389.43s]  somebody else is going to say it in the chat. I know they are. Get on top of it. Well, uh, okay.
[3391.83s -> 3412.02s]  Oh, quantum reading. Wait, this church cave shard, distress beacon. Wait, escape pod two.
[3412.66s -> 3424.01s]  I already did that. Okay. Whatever. Can I get anywhere else here looking for, I need to explore
[3424.01s -> 3432.38s]  this tower again while this time. Watch out. This is how it's made, how they make a Snickers bar.
[3432.38s -> 3452.73s]  Yep. Don't minus two that one. That was a solid reference to like 20 minutes ago. How,
[3452.73s -> 3456.73s]  I can't believe I'm getting minused here. I can't fucking believe it.
[3465.93s -> 3482.18s]  I got a tough, tough crowd tonight. I need to, I need a reader reader. I need one of those wall
[3482.18s -> 3502.92s]  readers. There's a wall reader. I need a wall reader. Wait, is there a reader in here?
[3507.27s -> 3519.70s]  I think this door is sealed up. It is. I gotta get here another way. What about the bottom here?
[3520.74s -> 3531.64s]  All right, here we go. I have a reader here. Have I read this one? Sometimes,
[3531.64s -> 3535.40s]  past, since I checked in with you, Pi, how are you an idea of progressing at the sun station?
[3535.96s -> 3540.36s]  So, my plan will either fail explosively or succeed explosively.
[3541.48s -> 3546.52s]  Why, you know, I don't find that funny. Hypothesis time spent away from the station
[3546.52s -> 3552.07s]  would be beneficial to you both. I'm immensely interested in testing your hypothesis. Yeah,
[3553.67s -> 3562.18s]  that at least we can agree on. I'm curious. Remy thinks I'm Remy thinks I'm a gas.
[3562.74s -> 3565.30s]  I don't recall requesting that you monitor this conversation.
[3566.26s -> 3581.72s]  Why is this so loud? Why is the sand so loud in this room in particular? I don't see what state
[3581.72s -> 3586.20s]  of matter you're you are has to do with this. And I don't recall supporting the sun station's
[3586.20s -> 3592.86s]  construction. But here we are. I did have some new info there. All right, with my take this out.
[3593.66s -> 3604.54s]  See what this one says. All right, what's this? Friends visiting from the hanging city. We are
[3604.54s -> 3609.58s]  planning the ash twin project at the high energy lab on Ember twins equator. Yes.
[3609.74s -> 3615.80s]  I became lost on Ember twin. My gratitude that Remy found me but the high energy lab is the
[3615.80s -> 3620.44s]  building with the large solar panels. I'm surprised I didn't see it. I already went in it though.
[3621.00s -> 3625.64s]  Imagine our otherwise immensely clever Konoi would lose his own head if it weren't for
[3625.64s -> 3635.53s]  automatically impossible. I already went into the higher energy lab didn't I? Two large solar panels.
[3636.25s -> 3646.26s]  Wait a minute. Are these quantum cactuses? All right, is this like a flappy bird experiment here?
[3646.26s -> 3665.72s]  Can I get in here? Can I float in there? Oh, fuck it is. It actually is. It actually is.
[3666.60s -> 3672.36s]  No, no, no. Patch it. Patch it. Patch it. Come on. No. I thought you guys are bullshitting me.
[3673.61s -> 3681.82s]  Oh, come on. I can't believe that you actually can do that. Wow. All right. I didn't I didn't
[3681.82s -> 3691.00s]  know it was that far. Shit. Okay. What is up there? Now I need to know what's up there.
[3691.24s -> 3702.28s]  Now I need to know what's up there. Damn it. I can't believe I didn't get up there.
[3703.48s -> 3709.32s]  Oh, that's so sad. What's inside that? I don't know. That's what I need to know. I'm going back.
[3710.20s -> 3735.06s]  Shit. Why did Omega Low get removed? Did it? What do you mean Omega Low? Oh, you're doing the thing
[3735.06s -> 3741.22s]  where everyone now has to write it because that's so stupid. Everyone's gonna write it now. Wait,
[3741.22s -> 3744.34s]  why did Omega Low get removed? And everyone's like, wait, did it? Let me check.
[3744.98s -> 3762.95s]  I gotta check. That's the oldest trick in the book, too. Where am I going? Just use autopilot.
[3763.59s -> 3771.99s]  It's the safest way as long as there's no sun. Autopilot's going a little fast.
[3772.87s -> 3796.12s]  I'm not doing this. Let me get back. Let's go. Come on. Oh, what the fuck?
[3806.62s -> 3828.55s]  Good branding. Did I miss anything else on this? What? Oh, shit. Is there nothing else on this
[3828.55s -> 3846.49s]  planet that I can't see? Sweat check? Not at all, actually. Zero. I'm good to go. I went,
[3846.49s -> 3858.20s]  remember I did this and I went, oh. And then I went this way. Something over here. What is this?
[3858.20s -> 3875.56s]  Is this like buried? This is probably a ship or something. It's coming out. Oh, the more the sand
[3876.12s -> 3890.34s]  drops, the surface goes down right. Okay, that's interesting. I didn't know that was happening.
[3890.34s -> 3895.22s]  It took him 10 hours to notice that. That's like the second time I've been on this planet.
[3897.10s -> 3928.79s]  Yeah, it took me 10 hours to notice. I've been here twice. I'm almost out of fuel.
[3930.89s -> 3963.02s]  Uh, give me, give me, I'm give, watch out, don't get in there. Now it's on the other planet. Fuck,
[3963.02s -> 3974.06s]  come on, man. Come back to me. Why does it happen to me all the time? Oh, well. Just don't use that
[3974.06s -> 3984.06s]  much fuel. Jump over to it. No. There ain't shit on this whole planet. Look at all the ground I've
[3984.06s -> 4010.82s]  covered on the map. There's nothing even here. It's because, it's because I have to wait, so I
[4010.82s -> 4016.18s]  can't, I should, I shouldn't, I should never come here immediately. Because the sand is too high.
[4016.34s -> 4030.49s]  I can't do anything. Let's just ski around the planet. But not too far. Okay, here we go.
[4030.49s -> 4045.86s]  Going over here. Okay, here we are again. Back at the North Pole. All right, let's go this way.
[4049.78s -> 4066.79s]  Save the fuel. Well, I mean, this, this whole run is just a wash anyways. Not if you're good.
[4067.75s -> 4072.25s]  All right, here we go. So right in the equator is where this is.
[4073.64s -> 4092.57s]  Is this where the cactus trap is? What is this? Oh, this shit's getting revealed now too. Wait,
[4092.57s -> 4098.63s]  can I, can I go in this window? I can. All right, so is there anything up here that I need to
[4098.63s -> 4110.04s]  look at? What's up here? Have I been up here? No, I've been here, yeah. This is where that is.
[4111.00s -> 4120.36s]  Fuel's almost gone. All right, so how long have I been walking around on this planet?
[4121.83s -> 4125.03s]  So don't ever come here unless it's been at least like five to ten minutes.
[4125.99s -> 4142.34s]  All right, here's the cactus room. No fuel for the cactus room. Well, where is this on the map?
[4142.90s -> 4149.56s]  I know that there's no fuel here. Somebody left it in the corner. Oh, we're dead. So it might as
[4149.56s -> 4168.65s]  well just end it. All right, that's right in the equator. I'm going to land the ship there after
[4168.65s -> 4172.73s]  I do something else in like 10 minutes because that's how long it takes for that building to
[4172.73s -> 4198.90s]  show. I'm going to go back to what I was doing before. Back into the canyon. Try to find this
[4198.90s -> 4211.22s]  sunless city. Sunless city. Yes, the Ashtron project was planned at the high energy lab,
[4211.22s -> 4214.58s]  a building with large solar panels on Emperor Twin's equator. Yes,
[4215.46s -> 4232.23s]  it can only be accessed by a path from the sunless city. Do a third cactus in a row. Let's go. No,
[4232.23s -> 4238.65s]  I'm not going to do that. I've been to the city once already. I just don't remember. It was just
[4238.73s -> 4243.78s]  in game time. I just don't remember. I had there was that sign that I saw to
[4261.53s -> 4284.70s]  mark it on the map. Rhinoceros beetle brain. That's a very, that's incredibly specific animal.
[4285.85s -> 4303.74s]  Why a rhinoceros beetle? That's very specific. Let's go. So I'm looking for,
[4304.70s -> 4324.94s]  what am I looking for again? Not there. Up here, right? Is that staircase?
[4333.91s -> 4348.57s]  That's there. No, please put me back in. Put me back in quick. Put me back in quick. Put me back
[4348.57s -> 4359.82s]  in quick. Put me back in. Oh my God. No. Why couldn't I go back in? Oh my fuck. I'm so mad
[4359.82s -> 4369.85s]  right now. You have no idea. You have no idea. I'm so fucking mad. Why couldn't I come back? Why
[4369.85s -> 4378.38s]  wouldn't it put me back in? Why wouldn't it put me back in? Fuck. I'm so mad. I can't believe it.
[4383.74s -> 4394.06s]  No suit. No suit. One. Cactus two. Sun zero. We're on a roll tonight. We're on a roll,
[4394.06s -> 4398.46s]  ladies and gentlemen. A roll, I tell you. God damn it. What a pain in the ass.
[4401.94s -> 4409.16s]  Put the suit on. Why can't I just permanently be in the suit? And I tried, I instantly fucking knew
[4409.16s -> 4413.80s]  and I tried. Instantly. Instantly. Within an instant to get back in. It didn't work.
[4414.90s -> 4439.46s]  I can't, apparently you have to have the suit on to get beamed up. God. Sun zero. Oh, I'm so mad.
[4440.10s -> 4443.94s]  All right. Settle down. Settle down. I'm just gonna go back to that thing. I'm so angry.
[4444.58s -> 4456.26s]  Like, I'm not even, I'm not comedy angry right now. I'm like, pissed off angry. You know, there's
[4456.82s -> 4464.49s]  like comedy angry and there's like fucking, I'm like mad. I think I crossed the comedy
[4464.49s -> 4474.33s]  anger threshold right now. Okay. Put your stupid suit on. I love how I could, I have to put the
[4474.33s -> 4480.17s]  suit on, but I can't take the suit off. Like in space. Just, why can't I just rip the helmet off?
[4481.21s -> 4502.70s]  I got it on. So this is, this is the lab, right? Can I get anywhere from here? I don't know. Did
[4502.70s -> 4511.34s]  I fully explore this place? Eight pod two. Yeah. Let's get pod three. We already looked at this.
[4512.06s -> 4532.07s]  We did already see this. Just making sure I don't miss anything. We've already seen this. Okay.
[4533.29s -> 4546.79s]  Ah, enormous cavern. Yup. Long shelter. Wait, hold on. Shelter site. Where's the big scary thing?
[4547.35s -> 4567.51s]  I have to investigate that. It was this way. No, this is the oxygen place. Wait, do I have
[4567.51s -> 4582.34s]  to go through this again? Where's the monster? Okay. It's this one, right? Yeah. Right. Okay.
[4584.90s -> 4609.64s]  This can be investigated more. I can drop down from somewhere into here. All right. Let's go.
[4618.30s -> 4631.93s]  Found a shortcut hole. I already did. Did I find the shortcut hole already? Wait, very early on.
[4631.93s -> 4641.08s]  I did. What? You found a shortcut yesterday out here. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Yeah. Out
[4641.08s -> 4648.81s]  here. You are. No, you're right. I did out. Yeah. I think I know what that is. I think it's out
[4648.81s -> 4661.18s]  around here, isn't it? It's somewhere like out here. Didn't I, I poked my head out or something.
[4661.18s -> 4672.66s]  It's like, it was like digging up in Minecraft. Where was it? I distinctly remember that happening
[4672.66s -> 4698.49s]  for some reason. I don't remember where it was though. Oh, what the hell was that? I don't
[4698.49s -> 4702.01s]  remember. I just really don't. There's so much information in this game. I have no idea where
[4702.01s -> 4719.51s]  that is. Let me refuel. Ugh. I do remember though, like poking my head out somewhere
[4720.63s -> 4731.78s]  or being like, oh, here I am. I think it's not like right around here or something, right?
[4732.66s -> 4758.33s]  I don't, I have no idea. Not a single clue. It's like a shortcut. I don't know. I don't know.
[4766.58s -> 4813.29s]  I don't know. Don't look at the VOD. Okay. It's right there.
[4814.57s -> 4826.12s]  But where do I go from? I'm going to pull my fucking. I can't wait. This is, didn't I open this?
[4827.08s -> 4842.94s]  This is not it. That's not it. I didn't open that. No. Damn it. Let me try going this way.
[4843.90s -> 4871.77s]  Be down here. What's that? Where's the sand? No. Wait. Big bits came in. Oh shit. They did.
[4873.43s -> 4881.91s]  Daddy Umbra gave 10,000 bits. Thanks for the a hundred dollars. And is this like a,
[4881.91s -> 4886.23s]  what is it? E-mode? What is this E-mode? PJ salt. I thought that was a toilet.
[4889.45s -> 4896.73s]  Uh, thanks for the 10,000 bits, dude. Uh, they say my socks were hard to put on today. Thanks a lot,
[4896.73s -> 4900.87s]  Jeremy. Did you just get out of the shower and then try to put your socks on? What a mistake that
[4900.87s -> 4911.18s]  was. That was the biggest mistake. You gotta be more careful. But thanks for the a hundred dollars.
[4911.90s -> 4921.08s]  That's a shitload of money. Thanks for the fucking massive, massive money drop.
[4923.45s -> 4932.79s]  Putting on socks while your feet are wet is impossible. And then we just had five community
[4932.79s -> 4935.67s]  subs too from Super Bruce. Thank you, Super Bruce. I've no idea. Tell me where to go. I don't care.
[4936.98s -> 4939.94s]  Like literally tell me where to go. I'm never going to find this. You know I won't.
[4940.50s -> 4958.89s]  I will never find this. He doesn't care. I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to find,
[4958.89s -> 4966.20s]  I'm not going to remember where this is. You got like 10 planets, 60 locations on each planet.
[4966.20s -> 4972.52s]  That's 600 locations. And then you got like on each 600 locations, you got 20 dialogue options.
[4973.16s -> 4976.04s]  We're talking about like 12,000 places in my brain. I don't know where they are.
[4976.44s -> 4996.60s]  Okay. Go to the gravity cannon. Is that even on this planet? Is the gravity cannon even on this
[4996.60s -> 5009.94s]  planet? Let me go with my ship. Let me go to the ship. Let me go to the ship. You're already out
[5009.94s -> 5033.30s]  of time. So it's the gravity cannon. Where's that fucking gravity cannon? That's the thing.
[5033.30s -> 5038.04s]  That's like the broken thing. Yeah. I think I know what it looks like. I just don't know where it is.
[5038.04s -> 5050.26s]  Okay. There it is. So this, this, this, the Dark Souls shortcut was here.
[5050.26s -> 5055.46s]  The shortcut was here. I never would have found this. No way. Not in a thousand years.
[5058.76s -> 5067.40s]  I never would have remembered it. You just saved like at least an hour or two of this stream.
[5068.52s -> 5073.72s]  Thank you guys. Another hundred dollars from Daddy Umbra. 10,000 more bits.
[5076.06s -> 5082.68s]  $200 total down in bits from Daddy Umbra. Jerma, make a joke or I'll send more.
[5084.76s -> 5101.58s]  What? Make a joke or I'll send more. Why don't I just be quiet? You just told
[5101.58s -> 5105.74s]  me if I don't say anything that's worth it, then you'll have more money.
[5112.06s -> 5117.70s]  Well, make it so you don't spend any more money. I don't even have a joke right now.
[5117.70s -> 5122.02s]  I don't have anything to say. I'm desperately trying to find this city.
[5122.82s -> 5144.10s]  What's this? This is the, okay, I remember this is the quantum cactus.
[5144.98s -> 5163.91s]  No quantum cactus here. Wait, can I close this? Damn it. Is it further down? Is it all the way down?
[5163.91s -> 5194.06s]  No, this dude is crazy. Above the door. Like, you mean up there? Like not even going in the cannon?
[5194.78s -> 5211.19s]  It's above the door to like up here. I never would have found this. Never. Never would have found it.
[5212.42s -> 5225.26s]  Never would have found it. All right, remember where this is. How do I mark this? Found it last
[5225.26s -> 5236.22s]  stream. Yeah, and that's fine. But I've also found a lot of other things last stream. Yeah,
[5236.22s -> 5241.86s]  I need like a team of 10 people to be all have a different planet in their brain. I got to hire
[5241.86s -> 5249.54s]  people to remember what happened on each planet. You're the Brittle Hollow Guy. Oh, wait, hold on.
[5249.54s -> 5269.21s]  This is important. There's no ghost over there. Ghost right there though. Okay, I'm going to go
[5269.21s -> 5300.23s]  that way. What? All right, now let's go there. Okay, made it. Yeah, this fills with sand.
[5300.23s -> 5305.03s]  This is already filling with sand. Just remember what that was. Big cannon right above the door.
[5316.74s -> 5323.61s]  Yeah, okay, I can come here later. I'm gonna come here immediately, go right to the cannon,
[5323.61s -> 5333.62s]  go right in. You got to get here insanely fast. Yeah, I will. Now I remember where this is.
[5333.62s -> 5339.38s]  It's not gonna take me 100 years to get here. Just I'm gonna break my fucking neck on the ceiling.
[5339.94s -> 5368.12s]  The sand and the neck breaking is the loudest sounds in the whole game. Daddy Umbra again,
[5368.92s -> 5381.86s]  you're at $250 worth of bits. 25,000 bits. Derma, do you love us? I love the end. I love this whole
[5381.86s -> 5391.35s]  community. I think everybody's great. Well, I love each individual, every single individual one of
[5391.35s -> 5397.99s]  you. Now that I cannot say. I don't know you individually. I know you collectively as a group.
[5401.34s -> 5410.39s]  I don't know. It could be a serial killer watching right now. You know, I can't make that kind of
[5410.39s -> 5427.90s]  statement. All right, let's do it. I got the suit on. I know where I'm going. One of you could be
[5427.90s -> 5433.74s]  embezzling millions of dollars into like offshore bank accounts or something. Like I can't say that
[5444.73s -> 5464.66s]  through donations. All right, let's get in there quick. But no, I love this community.
[5464.66s -> 5468.74s]  I love this place. I love this space here. I think it's a lot of fun. I think it's great.
[5469.54s -> 5490.86s]  All right. Where's that cannon? Where's that cannon? Where's the cannon? Cannon, cannon,
[5490.86s -> 5496.62s]  cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, where's that cannon?
[5497.58s -> 5539.69s]  What's that? I've ever seen that. No, focus. Here we go. Nice. Nice, dude. Nice. Okay, let's go.
[5541.05s -> 5545.29s]  Gee, I'm so fucking nervous right now. God. Shake, shake around a little bit.
[5546.49s -> 5555.61s]  Move. Ah, fuck. Okay. No, fuck. I'm okay. Go down here. Ah, okay. Slow down. All right,
[5555.61s -> 5565.11s]  we got we have some info anglerfish overlook district stepping stone district high energy
[5565.11s -> 5578.12s]  lab trailhead eye shrine district knowledge should we build the sun station to power the astron
[5578.12s -> 5584.86s]  project are there other ways to generate this level of power theoretically yes practically
[5584.86s -> 5589.66s]  no i can't imagine discovering them in our lifetimes i understand this proposal is unsettling
[5589.66s -> 5595.58s]  but the sun station must be built we have to complete the project i almost can't comprehend
[5595.58s -> 5600.38s]  this is being suggested seriously the purpose of the sun station goes against every standard
[5600.38s -> 5604.46s]  we hold ourselves to and everything we believe in as a species i know what happens in the game
[5604.46s -> 5609.74s]  i figured out the story unsurprisingly i disagree we're pushing a possible new technology further
[5609.74s -> 5617.70s]  than ever before they tap into the sun with the sun station and they do this fucking weird they're
[5617.70s -> 5621.86s]  trying to make a new energy source or they're trying to go forward in time or backwards in
[5621.86s -> 5625.22s]  time and they use the power from the sun which makes the sun supernova putting into a time
[5625.22s -> 5630.34s]  that's the sun explodes because they tapped into it i get it if we fail and probably the
[5630.34s -> 5639.53s]  we would question destroy ourselves in our life here potential annihilation of an entire star
[5639.53s -> 5643.85s]  system is too severe we shouldn't build the sun station but if you were going to build one where
[5643.85s -> 5649.21s]  would it be your failure is a poor reason not to try i believe if we're cautious the sun station
[5649.21s -> 5655.69s]  will work look i'm deeply honored i comprehend your position if we aren't all but certain
[5655.69s -> 5659.21s]  it will not cause destruction once we built it then i won't support the station's use
[5660.41s -> 5672.26s]  all right now what these are oh wait what's down here
[5678.70s -> 5696.14s]  high energy lab yeah all right hold on all right sand's coming sand's coming sand's coming let's
[5696.14s -> 5710.82s]  go i can teleport okay i'm gonna come back here every day what else is in here i follow the trail
[5710.82s -> 5740.70s]  i guess i guess we're gonna follow this um okay can't do that um can i was i too did i take too
[5740.70s -> 5763.96s]  long is there a place i can jump through oh shit hold on wait wait wait wait wait wait wait i might
[5763.96s -> 5776.01s]  die is gonna crush my head this is gonna crush my head can i actually do this i'm gonna try all right
[5776.01s -> 5793.50s]  if it's a failure don't matter i'm gonna teleport back anyways come on hurry up does this actually
[5793.50s -> 5811.13s]  go over the lip what ceiling is far away okay now i'm gonna go one two three go really really
[5812.73s -> 5838.73s]  really keep going what what no what hold on wait go this way oh no go go go quick oh
[5841.37s -> 5859.74s]  oh i thought i did it where the hell am i oh my goodness where am i going uh keep following this
[5859.74s -> 5873.80s]  trail oh wait what's over here don't go in it yet three minutes till oxygen explodes what but
[5873.80s -> 5897.93s]  this stuff over here is there anything over here all right not worth it i'm going up huh what where
[5897.93s -> 5926.28s]  am i going where am i going um oh oh go go go why into that oh all right i did it i think i did it
[5926.28s -> 5933.34s]  or something oh shit i did it okay i made it what do i do what's this thing what's that do
[5934.34s -> 5944.14s]  what are these are these special these special buttons warp core warp core warp core how many
[5944.14s -> 5950.10s]  different warp cores are there is there a secret this gotta be like a hold on this is probably
[5950.10s -> 5954.94s]  gonna be like i open a door or something come on like this guy i've got i have to be able to open
[5954.94s -> 5961.46s]  a door break this glass can i shatter the glass read record show nomai arriving at the warp
[5961.46s -> 5966.92s]  receiver umbrella hollow very slightly poor departing on the white house station i mean
[5966.92s -> 5973.66s]  i are devising an experiment to test if this is real phenomena or simply machine error initial
[5973.66s -> 5979.34s]  things first our experiment setup will first pair a small black hole core with a small white
[5979.34s -> 5991.43s]  hole core to mimic the setup on the white hole station clown brain setup will first pair a small
[5991.43s -> 6000.22s]  black hole with a small white hole it is possible for an object to exit a white hole before entering
[6000.22s -> 6007.54s]  the corresponding black hole in theory what we want to try to reproduce is a negative amount
[6007.54s -> 6012.90s]  of time elapsing between something entering the black hole and exiting the white hole at its
[6012.90s -> 6027.93s]  destination what the fuck are you talking about man an update our experiment here reproduced the
[6028.01s -> 6035.61s]  anomaly in arrival and departure times but pi is unconvinced but it's more than an equipment error
[6035.61s -> 6044.01s]  i hope to strengthen the effect to render it visible to the unaided eyes for that end we
[6044.01s -> 6048.97s]  decided to try adding more energy i imagine the sunless city's energy supply should prove sufficient
[6052.14s -> 6059.72s]  all available energy has been rerouted from the way to have room to our experiment rami and i are
[6059.72s -> 6068.78s]  about to run a new test hypothesis confirmed hypothesis confirmed i saw it i saw it hypothesis
[6068.78s -> 6080.52s]  confirmed is this a germa stream we just said the same thing four times in a row this is beyond
[6080.52s -> 6085.24s]  extraordinary this changes everything what a beautiful day for the intersection of abstract
[6085.24s -> 6094.50s]  theory and practical application of note rami yarrow requests that we let him know before we
[6094.50s -> 6105.21s]  reroute energy to the experiment hypothesis train i'd hate to leave him in the dark new info okay
[6105.21s -> 6128.34s]  now the question is oh there's a press this button what did i just do we're at full power
[6128.98s -> 6137.18s]  oh man there's more the southern observatory is asking if creating a 22 minute interval is
[6137.18s -> 6143.34s]  possible that is to have something arrive 22 minutes before it is actually sent through the
[6143.34s -> 6156.38s]  warp that's just enough time for germa to do an interview we've learned the negative interval
[6156.38s -> 6160.70s]  of time between departure and arrival can be increased by adding more energy to the warp core
[6161.50s -> 6167.48s]  problematically the energy required to extend the interval increases at an exponential rate
[6168.60s -> 6173.66s]  creating a 22 minute long interval is possible but we can't are currently unable to generate
[6173.66s -> 6183.94s]  the necessary energy the energy is currently unavailable you say you're a gas pie i mean i
[6183.94s -> 6188.90s]  believe it would be necessary to invent a new method of producing energy a thrilling but enormous
[6188.90s -> 6192.66s]  undertaking we would also require advanced warp technology able to handle such energy
[6193.78s -> 6203.32s]  anyway we're getting we're getting to you know you watch the first six episodes of the anime
[6203.32s -> 6207.72s]  and you go wow this is actually pretty interesting shit i this is cool and then you're at like the
[6207.72s -> 6213.10s]  middle 10 episodes of the anime and it just kind of goes off the rails in your head and they add a
[6213.10s -> 6224.33s]  bunch of shit and i don't like season two turns it upside down oh wait hold on i said the word anime
[6224.33s -> 6236.62s]  i forgot sorry about that my pun was unintended ramiya so i believe it's you who's uh error form
[6237.18s -> 6242.74s]  all right don't ever say the word anime someone will be very angry with you
[6243.70s -> 6254.92s]  it's like it's like just an automatic reaction you could be eating a bowl of macaroni and cheese
[6254.92s -> 6268.68s]  and if you hear the word anime some of you guys it's like how dare you the ashtron project will
[6268.68s -> 6273.99s]  be one of our biggest undertakings metaphorically and physically to build it we need a way to travel
[6273.99s -> 6286.34s]  quickly between ash twin and each location that holds crucial project materials you just got
[6286.34s -> 6299.18s]  punched in the stomach uh i can't laugh that hard because it's hurting me but that's funny
[6299.74s -> 6310.30s]  give that guy a fucking goal i wish i could give gold stars twitch has the vip system but that's
[6310.30s -> 6316.46s]  like kind of too much i just i want like a temporary a temporary like that i can put on someone
[6316.46s -> 6324.07s]  that only lasts like 30 minutes because if you vip somebody's like oh that's a very important
[6324.07s -> 6329.59s]  person for the stream you don't like remove the vip i want a system where i can like place a
[6329.59s -> 6335.35s]  dunce cap on them raya and be like you just you said i like what you said it's like a 10 minute
[6335.35s -> 6346.34s]  thing dunce cap and then their text is kind of is lit up for like five minutes that would be kind
[6346.34s -> 6356.65s]  of fun that's like what channel points is but without me giving it to you the time is frozen
[6356.65s -> 6361.43s]  right yeah the ashtron project will be one of our biggest undertakings yeah we need to travel
[6361.43s -> 6366.49s]  quickly between ash twin and each location that holds crucial project materials this is the sixth
[6366.49s -> 6371.61s]  location what if we used warp towers like the one we have on the white hole station to connect each
[6371.61s -> 6379.48s]  planet directly to ash twin folk root and i can begin work on this immediately in the black hole
[6379.48s -> 6389.35s]  forge where is it each tower on ash twin will warp to a different planet each tower on ash twin will
[6389.35s -> 6394.81s]  warp to a different planet we can design each tower to visually reflect its warp destination
[6394.81s -> 6405.98s]  okay the giant's deep tower for instance could resemble a cyclone and we could add trees to the
[6405.98s -> 6415.98s]  timber hearth tower yeah so it's like a sham it's their towers they're not even they're not planets
[6415.98s -> 6426.34s]  they're towers you don't get you don't travel to the fucking i mean they add they added trees in it
[6426.34s -> 6444.23s]  to make you think that wait did i do this one yet oh wait wait wait what is this six here one two
[6444.23s -> 6461.88s]  three four five hell all right i just opened it this better be open from now on this door will need
[6461.88s -> 6469.70s]  to remain closed for some time behind you lab is now being used to design the twa or project
[6471.56s -> 6483.42s]  your area you use the sound of the city we got it yeah we got it now what am i supposed to do in
[6483.42s -> 6487.82s]  here wait where is this on the map so i don't i can actually remember where the hell this is
[6490.39s -> 6497.46s]  it's okay it's where the big tower is the big um like paper mache tower kind of up uh
[6497.46s -> 6515.59s]  uh right above the equator and the northern side okay let's go down here so uh what we got
[6515.59s -> 6556.57s]  what can i do turn this on okay black hole white hole black hole white hole oh black hole white
[6556.57s -> 6587.94s]  hole okay close it up wait what's that what we're looking at okay that's what all right that was
[6587.94s -> 6614.26s]  weird what about uh two black holes about white hole black hole what does it do okay so what about
[6614.26s -> 6638.78s]  black hole and nothing black hole nothing is there what am i supposed to do so if you go into a
[6638.78s -> 6648.17s]  black hole you come out of the white hole what do two white holes do anything okay do i is this do
[6648.17s -> 6669.54s]  i need to do anything about this yeah okay so you go in you come out right okay is there anything
[6669.54s -> 6688.04s]  i'm supposed to do in here put it back in put it back in put it back in put it back in
[6699.96s -> 6733.99s]  you destroyed the fabric of spacetime this is a joe credit sequence right you got the kazoo ending
[6742.01s -> 6747.21s]  no i don't want the kazoo ending i want the real one the one that people talk about that's
[6748.17s -> 6764.39s]  i don't want the kazoo ending no i can load it right i can load the save and do it
[6764.39s -> 6800.36s]  what the fuck did that just say load previous save thank god did i learn all that info what's
[6800.36s -> 6812.54s]  what's the previous i didn't learn anything no i did okay i saved it high energy lab and then ash
[6812.54s -> 6825.14s]  wind tower designs ash twin tower designs okay so that's now that connects to here
[6826.52s -> 6831.48s]  statue island connects to here high energy lab connects to here black hole forge don't know where
[6831.48s -> 6845.03s]  it is we've almost what is this probe tracking module what the fuck looks like the modules
[6845.03s -> 6853.59s]  underwater oh the thing that shoots out of that ship in the very beginning is the tracking module
[6855.02s -> 6865.80s]  which lands on giants deep which is what's in the center of giants deep interesting
[6866.60s -> 6874.65s]  what else have i not done here southern observatory i signal locator on brittle hollow
[6875.21s -> 6881.40s]  hole there is a path beneath the surface that leads to the observatory the trailhead starts
[6881.40s -> 6887.54s]  at brittle hollow's equator bribeck says you can't get into the observatory from the surface
[6888.26s -> 6891.94s]  but there's probably a path to it beneath the crust somewhere there's a door to the
[6891.94s -> 6901.94s]  observatory on the surface but it's broken brittle hollow path in the equator let's go boys and girls
[6901.94s -> 6927.24s]  let's go i can't believe i got the kazoo ending brittle hollow equator brittle hollow into the
[6927.24s -> 6947.59s]  equator let's go bye please can we get hyped i turned off hype trains that don't exist anymore
[6947.59s -> 6966.10s]  on this channel dude you ready to get scammed i can't even turn it on i think this i think
[6966.10s -> 6975.38s]  the broadcast has to be off before i can turn it on all right we need to get to the equator
[6975.38s -> 6984.62s]  there's a path leading to this observatory going a little too fast all right let's land
[6985.42s -> 6999.99s]  walk out there i only don't it because i want to see hype trains i want to refund
[7000.63s -> 7005.35s]  look we could just pretend that it's on right now okay so there's a path on this equator okay
[7005.35s -> 7028.31s]  ready train stop i'm not seeing i'm not seeing any hype you know we're not even at level zero
[7028.31s -> 7043.32s]  all right well two people just got banned so uh that's like that's like two dollars
[7043.32s -> 7054.71s]  all right two people got banned so that's all right hype it up freeze detected is this it
[7054.71s -> 7066.39s]  now this is the uh no this is it this is it the trees are moving the trees are moving the tree
[7066.39s -> 7073.37s]  everything's moving yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep need to go to the equator gotta go
[7073.37s -> 7078.17s]  to the equator go to the equator equator equator when you find a path on the equator
[7078.17s -> 7085.96s]  here wait a minute can i get in from here the door is broken right is the door even down here
[7087.00s -> 7105.35s]  all right hold on this goes this i remember this part confused me this was very confusing to me
[7108.86s -> 7123.85s]  up let's try and see what's up here dude what do you give me a break i might be going this fast
[7142.34s -> 7157.58s]  there's uh what's his name over there bribeck for sure wait he welcomed in this place above
[7157.58s -> 7163.58s]  you stands the tower quantum knowledge if you are making your first pilgrimage to the quantum
[7163.58s -> 7167.82s]  moon ascend these stairs and obtain the last of the knowledge you need for your journey
[7169.88s -> 7227.70s]  really the final clue the final hint no no that didn't do shit i'm trying to willy wonka my way
[7227.70s -> 7241.83s]  over there hold on what does this say crossroads all right turn it on all right look at this look
[7241.83s -> 7247.11s]  at this sonic the hedgehog level three map give me a break i'm not gonna how am i gonna figure this
[7247.11s -> 7258.22s]  out i'm just whatever i'm just gonna go in hang on left bring it right bring it we're going left
[7258.94s -> 7274.41s]  oh we're oh oh what happened hello move i just got hit in the head by a rock
[7278.57s -> 7325.77s]  oh no what did i get hit in the head what the fuck is that what is that grab it what
[7326.57s -> 7332.14s]  i'm so confused what is that why is this what's this floating here for
[7332.94s -> 7369.11s]  oh no this is okay this is the thing this is the thing yeah this is this place oh shit
[7378.82s -> 7396.66s]  yeah yeah turn it on how do i turn this thing on dude stop doing quantum crack how do i turn
[7396.66s -> 7403.72s]  this on you like press a and it you put you where is it something i have to do
[7404.68s -> 7414.60s]  yep yep you stand on the war platform on the floor and wait until the tower aligns with its
[7414.60s -> 7426.79s]  corresponding astro body brittle hollow look up while the station's rotating you see the
[7426.79s -> 7444.98s]  alignment happens when the astro body's directly ahead yeah didn't i oh right i forgot i need to
[7444.98s -> 7477.05s]  do this like turn the damn thing on let's go all right where's my ship quantum crack quantum crack
[7478.92s -> 7508.54s]  oh crack that may or may not exist oh i felt that one okay let's go try this shit again
[7513.59s -> 7524.07s]  um don't do that please game all right where is that special place to go down
[7524.71s -> 7528.47s]  sounds gonna explode yeah i know it is i learned some more stuff though didn't i
[7529.03s -> 7572.52s]  this way can i wait can i that's too dangerous what is this have i been over this way before
[7577.43s -> 7584.98s]  yep this is that rock that disappearing rock i feel like i don't want to go do all this because
[7584.98s -> 7600.06s]  i'm gonna run out of time i'm just gonna run out of time this has to be so dark whatever let's go
[7611.19s -> 7618.06s]  pick something and stick with it i already i did i picked it i'm trying to figure out how to get
[7618.06s -> 7643.34s]  to this place in brittle hollow all right give me this thing check this out this doesn't want
[7643.50s -> 7664.73s]  move now this thing's not quantum i thought it was i can't take a photo of it because i'm observing
[7664.73s -> 7690.49s]  it when it's on the photo oh whatever this is where i was last time i don't know where the hell
[7690.49s -> 7701.46s]  am i even trying to get to down there all right no falling rock right not this time good all right
[7701.46s -> 7714.12s]  no gigantic falling crater good i have a minute but where am i going down there and then to the
[7714.12s -> 7737.10s]  left back where power no this is just wrapped around and i kind of yeah no i'm above the black
[7737.10s -> 7765.98s]  hole there he is all right switch this up a little bit where am i trying to get to um to the left
[7765.98s -> 7787.46s]  right now what uh what is what is this even for i have to be all right wait hey whoa it's falling
[7787.46s -> 7813.34s]  all the way in i go with it all right well then his higher side is gone now do i have to be flying
[7813.34s -> 7832.34s]  with that thing when what about down there what is that uh this shit's upside down i don't know
[7832.90s -> 7869.56s]  i really don't know can i flip this thing somehow and turn it upside down i gotta turn this whole
[7869.56s -> 7892.39s]  thing upside down how do i turn this upside down i'm gonna turn this upside down does this exist
[7892.95s -> 7901.83s]  over here too let me observe all right hold on a second hold on a second that thing's moving
[7901.83s -> 7925.10s]  no i'm moving now it's me that's moving it's me that's moving what hold on this whole thing
[7925.10s -> 7941.53s]  came apart can i stand on this okay wait now wait what's this doing here what is this thing doing
[7941.53s -> 7949.53s]  here hold on wait wait wait hold on wait wait wait wait wait turn off the light turn lights off turn
[7949.53s -> 7967.85s]  lights off turn lights off wait wait what does it say beneath your feet lies the tower of knowledge
[7968.89s -> 7975.22s]  can i go into this wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[7975.22s -> 7994.68s]  wait wait is this stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop slow down um
[7994.68s -> 8001.72s]  okay this is wait a minute that's the tower right there this is the tower of knowledge i was when i
[8001.72s -> 8011.32s]  already up there wait i this is the tower of knowledge this is the tower hold on can i go and
[8012.04s -> 8025.13s]  how much fuel do i have holy shit you gotta be fucking kidding me get up there it is it's the it's
[8025.13s -> 8035.43s]  the this is the actual tower it's the thing all right i get it i get it i get it no i'm so bad at
[8035.43s -> 8049.18s]  controlling flying around how high do i have to go all the way what's that over there no no no no go
[8049.18s -> 8074.98s]  all the way to the top pre-detected the fucking sun's gonna blow up let's just do quick read
[8074.98s -> 8083.26s]  something read welcome so your arrival here means you've completed your profession as even you're
[8083.26s -> 8087.54s]  ready to try quantum moon on your pilgrimage quantum moon will carry you just as it carried
[8087.54s -> 8090.82s]  me and many of my clan before me in the moon's sixth and most secret location and where is it
[8091.83s -> 8095.91s]  you'll be aided in your pilgrimage by the shrine our clan built in the quantum moon but remember
[8095.91s -> 8098.95s]  this is the final route to explore the sixth location the shrine must be on the moon's north
[8098.95s -> 8116.87s]  pole be curious on your journey what about this one what do i do with this the north pole has to
[8116.87s -> 8146.44s]  be on the north pole i already read this is there another one okay so wait what's this one i didn't
[8146.44s -> 8170.18s]  read one piece of text just one piece of text one piece of text let's say if you're here then
[8170.18s -> 8184.15s]  you mean that you made it too close oh shit all right the sixth location is you found the secret
[8184.15s -> 8203.02s]  of the sixth location the north pole of the quantum moon helps if you use at least two
[8203.02s -> 8215.10s]  percent of your brain this is a game about not knowing a single fucking thing about anything
[8215.10s -> 8226.63s]  just use your brain it's a mystery where you wake up every 20 minutes we've already determined
[8226.63s -> 8249.69s]  there's like 1200 different locations if that guy had dunce cap i really want how do i get twitch to
[8249.69s -> 8256.14s]  like make a dunce cap and that's not a bad thing that's a good thing that's that's like a term of
[8256.14s -> 8264.66s]  like that's for us that's we like that here power of quantum knowledge the sixth location
[8265.46s -> 8273.10s]  okay the quantum moon sometimes disappears possibly to an unknown sixth location many
[8273.10s -> 8277.02s]  know my went on a pilgrimage during which the quantum mood carried them to its sixth and most
[8277.02s -> 8283.98s]  secret location to explore the sixth location the shrine on the moon must be on the moon's north
[8284.54s -> 8304.78s]  pole let's go let's get to the moon hey it had a job interview and i got the job nice
[8305.74s -> 8322.36s]  there's good work oh yeah you do that job as best as you can make that fucking money all right
[8322.36s -> 8340.54s]  quantum flow where's the quantum what do you call that oh it disappeared make those bits make those
[8340.54s -> 8353.78s]  bits here was the singing moon come on so am i am i about to get to the here's the secret of the game
[8354.50s -> 8369.93s]  well that'd be interesting it is ready there literally right there dude come on it says i'm
[8369.93s -> 8398.70s]  going to the secret location i'm going very fast but it's very far away so we just got to
[8398.70s -> 8403.74s]  get this thing on the moon on the north pole so i have to make it disappear and reappear till
[8403.74s -> 8433.62s]  it's on the north pole and then open up the fucking elevator he doesn't understand velocity no i just
[8433.62s -> 8455.66s]  want to get there i just want to go to this location as fast as possible okay moon i'm ready
[8455.66s -> 8528.87s]  onto moon secret got to take a damn photo autopilot i can't autopilot to a thing that
[8528.87s -> 8561.08s]  doesn't exist okay here we are i first i i killed that guy again keep killing this guy all right
[8561.08s -> 8580.74s]  north pole let's get it on the north pole i'm floating i'm floating so much all right is it
[8580.74s -> 8589.91s]  on the north pole where is this thing it's okay it's on the south pole north pole there it is
[8590.79s -> 8647.91s]  okay it is now on the north is that the north pole watch this shit close that fucking door north
[8647.91s -> 8671.69s]  pole okay now i'm gonna take a picture of this all right close it okay here we go
[8673.56s -> 8733.64s]  sixth location ah what's going on secret sixth location here it is oh fuck it's gone um uh what's
[8733.64s -> 8748.06s]  even here uh that looks like a that's a suction cup is this like it is a suction cup over here
[8748.94s -> 8774.38s]  there's a person why am i getting um castle griffin steed vibes right now okay hello
[8775.40s -> 8795.54s]  soleno who are you we don't i can't do that i don't know what that means pick up identity stone
[8796.10s -> 8806.92s]  pick up you stone pick up eye of the universe stone pick up quantum moon stone pick up me stone
[8806.92s -> 8819.32s]  pick up explain stone how many powers do i get all right i want uh explain stone
[8828.46s -> 8851.13s]  insert explain stone oh explain uh explain me i imagine your purpose here is the same as mine
[8851.13s -> 8859.96s]  to learn about and to find the eye of the universe i'm unsure how you arrived here however perhaps
[8859.96s -> 8867.29s]  you came from another star system as my clan originally did that wasn't very good explanation
[8869.30s -> 8875.05s]  uh do do i have like three wishes or something how long do i get to do this for
[8875.05s -> 8889.46s]  explain uh explain the eye of the universe please there is fundamental uncertainty throughout the
[8889.46s -> 8895.06s]  universe normally this uncertainty is only observable on a very small scale as one approaches
[8895.06s -> 8904.20s]  the eye however that uncertainty grows enormously the quantum moon probably exhibits macroscopic
[8904.20s -> 8909.56s]  quantum behavior because of its proximity to the eye shards that broke off from the quantum moon
[8909.56s -> 8915.56s]  have a similar effect as i imagine you've seen elsewhere in this star system yeah i've seen them
[8916.68s -> 8921.24s]  conscious observation forces a quantum object to collapse to a single possibility
[8922.04s -> 8929.24s]  but what would happen if a conscious observer somehow entered the eye itself over time this
[8929.24s -> 8940.70s]  has become my clan's greatest question all right uh more more more stuff explain um explain you
[8940.70s -> 8954.39s]  explain you i need nine i need to explain you i am on my first pilgrimage to the quantum moon
[8954.39s -> 8962.02s]  all know my and my clan make this journey when we come of age even though the eye cannot be reached
[8962.02s -> 8966.26s]  from here the quantum moon remains special to us as it carries us nearer to the eye than any other
[8966.26s -> 8974.57s]  place we know i've journeyed here to be close to the eye while the eye is obscured from our site
[8974.57s -> 8990.89s]  we can see the quantum moon's reflection of the eye in the sky above us all right and explain
[8991.45s -> 9001.75s]  uh explain the quantum moon too let's get all info we can he keeps taking a selfie of us
[9002.47s -> 9009.82s]  all right have you encountered a quantum shard on another planet the shard looks the same as
[9009.82s -> 9016.30s]  the quantum moon surface does now while at the eye from this we can reasonably infer the quantum
[9016.30s -> 9023.35s]  moon's natural status as we see it now and that the eye is its primary location even the quantum
[9023.35s -> 9029.19s]  moon is the eye's moon it's likely that any characteristics the moon exhibits are also
[9029.27s -> 9033.59s]  exhibited by the eye itself quantum moon and its shards for instance are quantum
[9033.59s -> 9039.99s]  thus the eye is likely also quantum quantum eyes quantum moon's eyes the eye of the quantum moon
[9039.99s -> 9044.47s]  quantum existence in fact this moon is probably quantum because its proximity to the eye made it
[9044.47s -> 9048.47s]  quantum the same way the areas surrounding quantum shards that landed on other planets
[9048.47s -> 9062.02s]  eventually became quantum so many quantum so the eye is making this quantum okay quantum within a
[9062.02s -> 9076.20s]  quantum got it shards that land on other planets eventually became quantum too okay identify we
[9076.20s -> 9091.38s]  have explained everything so now let's identify me who the hell am i i've never met one of your
[9091.38s -> 9098.04s]  kind before it's an honor to speak with you i particularly admire your four eyes okay there
[9098.04s -> 9102.12s]  are many questions i would ask if i could comprehend your language you have my gratitude for understanding
[9102.12s -> 9121.88s]  mine chip log update i have four eyes but i don't know uh on a moon this is the quantum moon
[9121.88s -> 9127.56s]  where we both are standing despite also orbiting other celestial bodies the quantum moon is the eye
[9127.56s -> 9141.38s]  of the universe's moon all right identify identify identify you like what's your name oh you already
[9141.46s -> 9151.88s]  told me i am solenum anomai my clan arrived in this star system before my birth and we now call
[9151.88s -> 9163.26s]  it home what about identify the eye of the universe he's gonna be like i don't know what that is
[9163.26s -> 9176.09s]  because well that's what i'm looking for we are orbiting the eye of the universe now although we
[9176.09s -> 9182.01s]  cannot see it only the quantum moon's reflection of it the eye is older than the universe itself
[9182.01s -> 9197.51s]  and my clan believes it dwells in an extremely distant orbit around this star system wait i can
[9198.31s -> 9211.85s]  watch you and eye of universe
[9217.45s -> 9221.93s]  many of my clan have believed the eye called to us for a particular purpose i gotta keep track of
[9221.93s -> 9231.38s]  these when i was a child i used to believe the eye was maleficent they have lured my clan to the
[9231.38s -> 9238.66s]  star system only to vanish from them so completely but i don't fear the eye anymore in fact it became
[9238.66s -> 9243.86s]  my fondest hope to see the eye itself someday but i fear this may be beyond my reach you may
[9243.86s -> 9248.74s]  think i'm strange but i have a hypothesis that i may not be entirely alive perhaps my journey has
[9248.74s -> 9265.77s]  reached its end you and okay we're doing you's now you and quantum moon like many of my clan
[9265.77s -> 9268.57s]  before me i journeyed here to see the quantum moon's reflection of the eye this is the closest
[9268.57s -> 9274.81s]  to any of us have come to seeing the eye itself you and me you may think i'm strange but i have
[9274.81s -> 9284.58s]  a hypothesis that be oh yes we already know that you are you and me want to go to dinner later
[9285.46s -> 9299.48s]  what do you think you and me we do not have much connection you and i oh okay that's all right
[9299.48s -> 9303.40s]  still this encounter feels special i hope you won't mind if i think you as a friend
[9304.44s -> 9320.15s]  that's okay all right yeah fine that's all right okay you and moon quantum friend zone
[9322.63s -> 9329.19s]  you did i do them all you and explain no i did i did them all you and me you and the eye did i do
[9329.19s -> 9336.87s]  them all this guy's probably so sick of writing this shit he's like all right man like how many
[9336.87s -> 9358.70s]  times you want to write the same thing okay now let's do me okay me and i suppose you could reach
[9358.70s -> 9364.23s]  the eye of the universe would you try to enter it what do you imagine the effects of a conscious
[9364.23s -> 9376.36s]  observer might be um i don't know i just feel like whoa quantum moon and me is this your first
[9376.36s -> 9381.48s]  time on the quantum moon it's my first time if you've come here looking for answers i hope you
[9381.48s -> 9391.21s]  find them okay me and you me and moon me and i didn't okay what else have you not done moon and
[9392.52s -> 9411.72s]  i right moon identify explain these are the two tenets of nomai philosophy to seek out and to
[9411.72s -> 9426.44s]  understand is our way of living now we got to do uh moon and we got have i done them all
[9427.56s -> 9444.81s]  moon and i i've done them all i think yeah i've done them all oh all right now how do i tell
[9444.81s -> 9483.96s]  this person like goodbye now what do we do uh i just walk by him all right what is there what
[9483.96s -> 9487.16s]  else shall i explore a little bit more i think i should explore a little
[9487.16s -> 9488.52s]  bit
[9498.58s -> 9526.57s]  is that the was that the guy wait didn't i you killed him i took a photo of him i took a photo
[9526.57s -> 9538.68s]  of him and killed him all right now this is here but i quantum murdered him he wasn't supposed to
[9538.68s -> 9554.04s]  be alive in this universe is her oh i quantum killed her should i go i think i got to go back
[9554.04s -> 9564.33s]  and process this in the ship i need to process this info we didn't learn anything yes we did we
[9564.33s -> 9581.14s]  learned that the moon is the eyes moon and it's an eye to go in where's that ship come on where's
[9581.14s -> 9596.31s]  the ship spawn the ship already i've been here before watching these guys i'm about to stand
[9596.31s -> 9615.74s]  on the clock wait this is maybe oh this is your ship this is your ship i found your ship i'm ready
[9615.74s -> 9685.82s]  to leave what what is that it sucked into the black hole i um what's over here hold on there's
[9685.82s -> 9694.79s]  something over i don't think i've been over here what is this the big bits came in daddy umbra
[9694.79s -> 9705.38s]  another hundred dollars from daddy umbra thank you daddy umbra again for your insane contributions
[9706.28s -> 9719.67s]  you're fucking hundreds of dollars wait did i just quantum lock myself in wait i have some
[9719.67s -> 9726.57s]  shit here they say but seriously want to give back for all the years of entertainment
[9726.57s -> 9730.39s]  and happiness you've given me and so many others keep being you you're an amazing person
[9733.67s -> 9749.34s]  thank you daddy umbra happy you think that way thanks daddy because i said daddy umbra
[9750.46s -> 9763.88s]  all right sun's coming in let me uh no but just fly to the sun who cares the sun hungers yeah i
[9763.88s -> 9785.45s]  got a lot of info that i have to process it's probably the sun the eye of the universe is
[9785.45s -> 9798.38s]  probably just the sun right that's probably what it is if i were to take a wild guess
[9799.42s -> 9819.08s]  i'd say this this quantum moon is the sun's moon suns don't have moons this is a video game though
[9819.72s -> 9842.09s]  it could okay so i i've learned too much and now a threat to the cosmic balance of the world right
[9843.21s -> 9870.07s]  how do i use this info one of these times i'm not going to wake up
[9878.54s -> 9907.06s]  all right ship time let's dump some knowledge all right sixth location is it quantum moon is the
[9907.06s -> 9911.94s]  eye of the universe's moon at this location the quantum moon becomes a reflection of the eye
[9912.98s -> 9917.62s]  the eye is likely the source of all macroscopic quantum phenomena in the solar system
[9918.74s -> 9932.49s]  i still have a quantum signal on giant steve it's at the bottom of the ocean though i can't get in
[9932.49s -> 9938.47s]  there the ash twin the nomai plan to construct technology capable of producing a 22 minute
[9938.47s -> 9946.68s]  negative time interval on ash twin i gotta get in here black hole forward i don't know how to
[9946.68s -> 9979.32s]  get in there either on ash twin still i don't know what that is ocean depths nomai on construction
[9979.32s -> 9984.28s]  yard saw something sink beneath the underwater current which they previously thought was
[9984.36s -> 9996.86s]  impossible something sunk beneath the current what the hell was it this huge nomai city just
[9996.86s -> 10004.79s]  north of bribex campsite subsurface energy readings the shuttle's equipment heard strange
[10004.79s -> 10008.95s]  energy readings coming from somewhere beneath the surface two of the nomai located a fissure
[10008.95s -> 10022.66s]  in the ice on the interloper sunward side they descended inside to investigate fissure in the ice
[10023.38s -> 10048.90s]  on the interloper sunward side let's go sounds like a lead hey look it's coming over now
[10049.46s -> 10073.53s]  fissure in the ice on the sun side that would be this side right side i'm currently going to
[10091.91s -> 10099.48s]  we gotta go down is that it right there is that it right in the middle right in the middle of the
[10099.48s -> 10128.81s]  ice cream cone what i thought the sun was farther away than that you and me both
[10129.93s -> 10141.78s]  we both thought that exact same thing classic sun joke ah i love this streamer
[10145.69s -> 10152.25s]  i had autopilot on too as far as anything i was gonna be
[10167.64s -> 10181.03s]  fucking bionic boomer adjustment that's complete what
[10186.47s -> 10202.70s]  sitting here adjusting my like back brace and shit oh no i didn't do that whatever i
[10203.10s -> 10212.98s]  uh i didn't even have the fucking controller in my hand you could even hear the straps moving
[10212.98s -> 10264.89s]  with two hands fucking autopilot i'm just gonna do it myself suicidal autopilot
[10277.88s -> 10294.44s]  okay let's coast bring it down like 300 don't plot a course through the sun
[10295.24s -> 10302.97s]  i have okay if you use google maps to drive somewhere it doesn't drive you in a straight
[10302.97s -> 10308.86s]  line through buildings why would it not the gps not be that sophisticated with space traveling
[10309.58s -> 10321.67s]  all right right there right it's the one right in the middle it's right there up in there
[10322.23s -> 10364.02s]  all right let's get on it where is this fissure in the ice how are we doing it's a maze it's
[10364.02s -> 10387.62s]  not really a maze but it might need to melt okay here we go it's gonna melt the fuck was that
[10387.62s -> 10393.74s]  what was that what was that what is that what was that was that like was that a snot bubble
[10393.74s -> 10439.24s]  coming out of my mouth what was that what are these things melt here it comes shit easy ghost
[10439.24s -> 10460.98s]  matter ghost matter there i can't go down this tunnel there's ghost shit in there oh man ghost
[10460.98s -> 10478.04s]  nearby where i'm receiving much stronger energy readings now that we're beneath the crust
[10478.92s -> 10483.32s]  whatever it must whatever it is it must lie somewhere below closer to the comet center
[10483.88s -> 10486.12s]  i'm starting to think it's more dangerous than we realized
[10487.32s -> 10492.62s]  all right can you hear us yes but your voices are faint i fear we will lose communication entirely
[10492.62s -> 10498.87s]  if you continue any deeper keep the shuttle warm for us clary will return the moment we
[10498.87s -> 10502.89s]  identify the source of the energy readings i understand but be cautious both of you
[10503.85s -> 10531.50s]  i think it's a ghost maze back up back up can i go just blow right through it
[10535.06s -> 10566.94s]  i was sliding i couldn't go anywhere i couldn't even go back i was sliding forward well i couldn't
[10566.94s -> 10582.01s]  just shot the probe but instead i don't know why i was panicking with the auto mode okay let's do
[10582.01s -> 10604.46s]  that again she's got to be that far away now don't do autopilot i'm gonna drive right into the sun
[10609.64s -> 10647.53s]  like why was i not i thought i was controlling it safe no get up first links
[10648.97s -> 10670.36s]  i've got to cut it off you're already about to cross the sun here i want to be on the other side
[10670.36s -> 10686.89s]  though autopilot what are you doing it's traveling kind of too fast i need to get in closer
[10686.89s -> 10695.72s]  there why slow down what the fuck is going on slow down slow the fuck down autopilot just
[10695.72s -> 10734.34s]  fucking almost screwed me what are you doing landed all right get in get in the fissure
[10734.90s -> 10745.35s]  let's do this again all right cool this time i'm gonna try to not get killed by the ghost matter
[10746.39s -> 10793.96s]  hola yo soy auto germa auto hello okay so i'm just curious what is it what else is down here
[10800.73s -> 10816.55s]  launch mode interesting that just dumps you out there that doesn't do anything this one is bogus
[10816.55s -> 10858.54s]  too what about this one okay what about this one yeah okay what about this one correct that one
[10858.54s -> 10869.83s]  is correct is that a curiosity what about this one the one i already did okay it's this one this
[10869.83s -> 10890.78s]  is the right one hey what's going on all right here we go there's two ways to go okay right
[10890.78s -> 10927.38s]  right we're good okay that's a that's a big cave with it's still going it was like hovering down
[10927.38s -> 10977.29s]  there how do i get down here up there oh be careful all right we got two what's this one go
[10977.29s -> 11018.98s]  there um um ghost detected nearby where is this all right it's the don't go down the left oh my
[11018.98s -> 11031.51s]  god are you fucking kidding me you're telling me that i have to do i have to shoot and let me
[11031.51s -> 11037.08s]  just do hold on wait this this might not be as which one was it was right right then left
[11038.23s -> 11051.27s]  and right oh oh it's already moving right that right then left and right i can't slow down
[11051.83s -> 11070.71s]  oh yes i can i'm good and left it's left it's left right and then hold on is it left
[11070.71s -> 11110.06s]  a good view what the fuck i go up oh my god i don't know which way which one of these
[11110.06s -> 11128.68s]  not this one not this one is it this one which one is it and then right then left
[11129.40s -> 11170.26s]  this is backwards i don't know where the fuck this is even going up there did i make it um
[11170.26s -> 11191.32s]  i'm still the dead person down here holy shit wait i need my i need my thing i need i need to take
[11191.32s -> 11207.82s]  photos can i read this the spirit the spherical stone casing here seems to be the source of the
[11207.82s -> 11211.58s]  energy readings no rather the source of what's within the stone i'm detecting some form exotic
[11211.66s -> 11218.82s]  matter there's a lot to read for floating around the stone is muting our energy readings they
[11218.82s -> 11226.58s]  should be 10 times what we're seeing at least hi i don't think we want this matter interacting
[11226.58s -> 11230.66s]  with us as far as i can tell direct contact with it would almost be fatal don't touch it
[11231.62s -> 11237.00s]  i've never encountered anything like this casing but it's all that's protecting us from what's
[11237.00s -> 11241.80s]  inside we're still of this matter is disturbingly volatile hi whatever the matter inside this stone
[11241.80s -> 11246.92s]  casing is it's more than just profoundly unstable it's under tons of pressure look at this density
[11246.92s -> 11253.82s]  scan i've never seen anything this is tightly compacted before this is orders of magnitude
[11253.82s -> 11258.62s]  worse than i'd imagined if this stone were to rupture the lethal matter within would rapidly
[11258.62s -> 11264.74s]  expand completely blanketing the star system almost instantaneously and the pressure is still
[11264.74s -> 11273.48s]  building as the comet approaches this star system return to the shuttle right now the rest of our
[11273.48s -> 11279.78s]  friends need to know they're in terrible danger leave your equipment and run what are you doing
[11279.78s -> 11284.82s]  pie the more we know about this alien matter the better our chances of survival i will learn what
[11284.82s -> 11296.95s]  i can hear go warn the others maybe they can construct shelter somehow now go don't touch it
[11296.95s -> 11332.84s]  but that's death so i've made it there's nothing else down here touch it touch it touch i'm gonna
[11332.84s -> 11372.26s]  touch it what's going on what's happening uh this doesn't do anything okay it's inside of this
[11373.46s -> 11401.08s]  i can't i'm i'm dead this is causing the ghosts what the fuck is this that's where i came from
[11403.16s -> 11418.09s]  okay well let's put it in the computer so that's the that's the source of the ghost matter i'm
[11418.89s -> 11445.05s]  it's green is that what's causing the explosion is that i don't know put it in the computer
[11447.35s -> 11454.04s]  ruptured core found two missing members of the nomai shuttle crewed near a large ruptured stone
[11454.04s -> 11459.00s]  looks like it exploded from the inside nomai traced the storage strange energy readings to
[11459.00s -> 11464.68s]  a spherical stone casing filled with some form of exotic matter they determined the exotic matter
[11464.68s -> 11470.20s]  was both lethal and under extreme pressure if the stone were to rupture the exotic matter within
[11470.20s -> 11474.12s]  would rapidly expand completely blanketing the solar system almost so this is the explosion
[11475.32s -> 11493.24s]  this is what's blowing up but the sun blows up that's not what happens okay yeah we well this
[11493.24s -> 11510.66s]  is completed kind of it already blew up yeah so all right still have to do this still need to do
[11510.66s -> 11532.06s]  this 22 minute course point sir for the ash twin finish reading what this this
[11534.84s -> 11537.88s]  there are three nomai aboard the shuttle one of them stayed behind to keep the shuttle warm
[11537.88s -> 11544.41s]  while the other two explored the interloper sorry the nomai who stayed behind lost contact with
[11544.41s -> 11551.51s]  the other two after they descended below the interloper's surface okay yeah i pulled the
[11551.51s -> 11561.16s]  their their ship nomai landed on the interloper not long after its arrival in the solar system
[11567.42s -> 11572.06s]  all right i'm gonna i'm gonna head back to ash twin and see if i can figure out how to do any
[11572.06s -> 11609.35s]  of this shit at ash twin give it a go now the question is what do i do that's the ultimate
[11609.35s -> 11627.62s]  question of the game ash twin it's the sand one felt to figure out that that sun station right
[11627.62s -> 11634.90s]  there how do i gotta get on that i have to get on the sun station too somehow i don't know how
[11634.90s -> 11656.71s]  would i do so i need to find this thing on ash twin this usb storage tower thing remember
[11663.90s -> 11698.86s]  how do i get in there you just go i know right i had it in me all along i just had to go
[11705.91s -> 11725.58s]  why are you guys doing rhythm heaven all right see if i can find something to do here
[11746.36s -> 11767.48s]  land okay find something to do here there's a tower the place to go i don't really have much
[11767.48s -> 11794.34s]  info besides one of the poles maybe there's this big tower here now i wonder the more the sand
[11794.34s -> 11807.64s]  drops is there going to be something else under here i don't think i've waited to see it's still
[11807.64s -> 11827.59s]  dropping yeah i'm just gonna wait this is gonna reveal some giant satellite
[11846.18s -> 11857.48s]  i didn't do it again did i where did it even go why does it have to keep happening i don't get it
[11859.26s -> 11867.75s]  don't you have suction cups on the bottom of your fucking ship by now okay so this is that but here
[11867.75s -> 11885.10s]  is okay here we go i've never waited this long what else is on is it keep going is there more
[11893.38s -> 11911.56s]  is that it no it's still going it is still going jesus how big is this thing like this
[11911.56s -> 11921.83s]  probably way it's something i can get in the middle or something let's see i'm gonna wait this out
[11922.55s -> 11967.91s]  hold on let me just let auto out bear back yeah he wanted to leave the room so how much further
[11968.95s -> 11974.95s]  like i have a question a question does does the planet run out of sand to a point where it's
[11974.95s -> 11988.95s]  just a core and there's nothing here i've never waited that long this just jumps all
[11988.95s -> 12011.16s]  sand over here and then this becomes empty oh this is a giant 22 minute hourglass
[12021.78s -> 12039.24s]  oh it takes 22 minutes and it's just it's just a timer but they called it the hourglass twins
[12039.24s -> 12048.04s]  before yeah but i didn't realize that it was dumping all the sand and it was a 22 minute
[12048.04s -> 12056.57s]  the 20 you die in 22 minutes why is it 22 minutes i knew that it was like oh the sand goes from here
[12056.57s -> 12064.31s]  to there but but what's the point of why is this why is this 22 minutes of sand i'm gonna die out
[12064.31s -> 12092.74s]  here with my ship oh right it's fucking gone this thing is huge i wonder if this is an entrance is
[12092.74s -> 12119.72s]  it just an entrance what else has been revealed and this shit is getting bigger i've already seen
[12119.72s -> 12135.51s]  this i can't really see now i've already been up there and over here there's one on both sides
[12136.55s -> 12146.31s]  there's one on a north and a south pole they're just huge antennas is it oxygen in here
[12147.03s -> 12189.19s]  yeah can i walk in it or anything is there oxygen in here somewhere hmm i'm really i want to see
[12189.19s -> 12222.38s]  what's at the very bottom your ship is right over there it's not it's over there what else before i
[12222.38s -> 12230.07s]  die coming like rocky oh fuck wait a minute what's this what is that what's this what's this what's
[12230.07s -> 12276.49s]  this oh i thought that was part of the uh never mind the oxygen here oxygen oxygen wake up
[12280.22s -> 12303.58s]  so all right every memory recorded by a nomai statue is translated to a corresponding storage
[12303.58s -> 12311.50s]  version within ash twin okay ash twin you can't do anything on it until like 15 minutes have gone
[12311.50s -> 12324.54s]  by to go in the towers that hold those masks i could do this i still haven't figured this out
[12324.54s -> 12336.49s]  either i'm gonna do the hanging city or i'm gonna try to go to the bottom of the ocean i have this
[12336.49s -> 12351.64s]  as well i was trying to get here but i got to the fucking quantum moon thing ocean depths nomai
[12351.64s -> 12355.16s]  on the construction you saw something sink beneath the underwater current which they previous
[12355.16s -> 12361.46s]  thought was impossible well what's sunk there try just dive in going 5 000 miles per hour
[12373.35s -> 12382.52s]  i'm just gonna drive straight to the planet as fast as i can and go and go into the water
[12384.07s -> 12390.62s]  or should i try to drop something in there i wonder if i should i drop something dump something in
[12390.62s -> 12414.42s]  there throw something in there i don't know tornado the tornado throws everything in the air but
[12414.42s -> 12434.84s]  well i don't know if it'll throw the center in the air i wonder if i can tell i remember seeing
[12434.84s -> 12463.88s]  inside of that room from one of those disk things i don't think i can go in there with the ship and
[12463.88s -> 12472.71s]  dive that far i don't think it's gonna work i'm just gonna end up dying and have to redo flying
[12472.71s -> 12511.32s]  across the galaxy again okay what else is even here that i've seen done that all right i have
[12511.32s -> 12531.14s]  a question i have a question can i fly into the super tornado okay what if i fly straight down
[12531.14s -> 12561.90s]  into the super tornado where is it let's do it i just did it i just did it i just did it i'm in
[12561.90s -> 12587.85s]  the fucking middle of tornado i did it i can't believe that worked i actually cannot believe
[12587.93s -> 12619.88s]  that that just worked found it this is like an elevator
[12629.51s -> 12654.25s]  okay i can't fly up there the shard is inside of that though it's gotta be something i can
[12654.25s -> 12661.11s]  clearly go and walk it just walk it don't even who cares about an elevator let's go
[12662.07s -> 12694.97s]  now this is the last shard right pieces he welcomed in this place this tower shares with
[12694.97s -> 12698.49s]  all who asked the knowledge needed to make his or her first quantum journey
[12699.69s -> 12708.49s]  i feel like i'm coming here a little late this would be my probably 30th quantum journey so far
[12712.54s -> 12740.04s]  oh let's go up enter this place without friends however these are lessons to learn for yourself
[12740.92s -> 12766.31s]  okay keep going up oh can i keep going up i should i'm going in the middle just want to make sure i
[12766.31s -> 12788.01s]  don't miss anything all right i'm gonna go down this is gonna kill me seek the wandering arch i
[12788.01s -> 12800.47s]  know this shit all right before we get into this what we're gonna i gotta pee i gotta pee real bad
[12801.67s -> 12966.62s]  i will take our actual first real break of the night i'll be right back pee time all right i
[12966.62s -> 12991.90s]  feel refreshed ow all right follow the wandering arch it's a quantum arch guaranteed
[12995.19s -> 13017.18s]  it is all right so i gotta take a photo of it oh you can't see sorry all the wandering arch so
[13017.18s -> 13042.84s]  i should just take a picture of it right okay go in my mic is not muted i'm right here i'm just
[13042.84s -> 13076.92s]  gonna go in uh unidentified signal i found you where are you going from here there it is all
[13076.92s -> 13089.45s]  right so what does this do for me in the grand scheme of things it just completes the story or
[13089.53s -> 13107.69s]  something i guess what's this observing a quantum object observe an image of a quantum object these
[13107.69s -> 13115.86s]  are the same observing a quantum object observing an image of a coin yes this is this is teaching
[13115.86s -> 13122.58s]  us the thing that i accidentally figured out because of the moon this is where you're supposed
[13122.58s -> 13141.58s]  to learn this that's fucking funny oh there it is i i figured it out i did it good thing i learned
[13141.58s -> 13166.44s]  how to do this what is that oh i can walk on this wall hold on i gotta take a photo of it
[13167.24s -> 13185.22s]  all right read the tutorial stones i mean i i kind of already know how this works the arch
[13185.22s -> 13231.13s]  and the crystal do not naturally meet i'll just get it on there and then freeze it hey hey quantum
[13231.13s -> 13244.92s]  quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum this is the last one but we made it harder
[13245.56s -> 13272.07s]  oh shit i don't know what i'm gonna do about this i have to rock climb with this okay i didn't mean
[13272.07s -> 13306.66s]  to do that did i just die build the quantum helicopter sounds coming wait what is going on
[13307.54s -> 13319.38s]  why are these not moving now i don't want this one to move now i want this one to move
[13319.38s -> 13336.02s]  right all the cameras watching them both there we go okay now you stay there now you stay here
[13336.90s -> 13364.57s]  okay bring it up this way there you go you stay here and uh that's it congratulations
[13364.57s -> 13374.49s]  you've been given the power tutorial we offer our congratulations you've learned the rule of
[13374.49s -> 13379.64s]  quantum imaging take this knowledge with you on the remainder of your quantum pilgrimage
[13380.90s -> 13392.78s]  remember the other quantum shards have other lessons to teach oh oh the shards are tutorials
[13398.90s -> 13409.69s]  right the shards are just tutorials that's the purpose our curiosity goes with are you on
[13409.69s -> 13413.37s]  your journey you walk in the footsteps of those who come before you and your path guides you those
[13413.37s -> 13424.84s]  will follow later sure thanks a lot at least we completed it and that's how we fall down
[13427.26s -> 13432.09s]  congrats on beating the tutorial thanks well let me go put this in the ship because
[13434.65s -> 13447.64s]  now i gotta figure out how to go to the bottom of the ocean get it in the computer
[13448.44s -> 13459.70s]  uh all tutorials have been completed actually all right this is done
[13460.66s -> 13471.26s]  pilgrimage to the quantum moon was a deeply significant journey for the nomai
[13472.14s -> 13476.52s]  they built a shrine on the moon to aid in the pilgrimage to its sixth location remember this
[13476.52s -> 13489.91s]  final rule yeah yeah yeah so he did all this so what remains these two uh this one's pretty much
[13489.91s -> 13497.69s]  done this over here but i don't need this i don't think do i because the big ticket is right here
[13498.49s -> 13516.33s]  i could do the ocean depth thing but i signal locator probe tracking one of the orbital probe
[13516.33s -> 13522.26s]  cannons three modules the probe tracking nodule is receiving data from the launched probe any
[13522.26s -> 13527.62s]  nomai onboard the probe tracking nodule will be the first to see the coordinates of the eye of the
[13527.62s -> 13534.74s]  universe a nomai computer reports the probe tracking module is missing i saw the probe tracking
[13534.74s -> 13539.78s]  module through a nomai projection pool it looks like the module is underwater
[13540.34s -> 13573.00s]  i can see purple electricity outside that's down here how do i get down there let's get up here
[13576.47s -> 13595.10s]  i think what do i want to go what the hell is that what is this what is that where's the
[13595.10s -> 13607.42s]  observatory where's the observatory southern observatory and the ocean current discovery
[13608.38s -> 13616.60s]  brittle hollows south pole the path beneath the surface at least i tried to do this before and
[13616.60s -> 13621.48s]  no i did this but then i got turned we did the moon thing we met that god that the
[13622.52s -> 13631.35s]  there was somebody there brittle hollow brittle hollows equator i got distracted okay brittle
[13631.35s -> 13644.33s]  hollows equator i feel like i'm getting close i feel like i'm getting what wait what is i what
[13644.33s -> 13673.18s]  is this i need i what is this what is that what is this thing have i even gone over here yet
[13673.98s -> 13693.67s]  it's white oh that's the white hole station all right let's go uh the sun's gonna blow up i did
[13693.67s -> 13715.58s]  all that i might as well just die yeah this sun's going yeah i'm running to the sun i i i have
[13715.58s -> 13747.48s]  probably like five minutes it's not enough time i can't even drive into the sun correctly hourglass
[13747.48s -> 13762.02s]  planet oh shit you are absolutely right you could that's true by this point it's it's gonna be like
[13762.02s -> 13782.90s]  yeah there'd be nothing there let's go no but we might no no it's over there's no way i'm gonna
[13782.90s -> 13791.13s]  get that fast enough just burn up with the sun who cares it's kind of cool though just die
[13796.39s -> 13800.15s]  i don't think being able to land and get out and do anything in 30 seconds is gonna work
[13802.71s -> 13813.24s]  looks cool all right brittle hollow equator
[13843.99s -> 13858.36s]  you don't know the ship has a landing mode i've used it like 100 times
[13868.07s -> 13884.65s]  all right brittle hollow behind me turn is it behind me
[13886.17s -> 13898.55s]  yeah what wait what the hell is it behind sun where is brutal hollow
[13905.91s -> 13908.87s]  i'm getting so turned around it's right there what what's going on
[13908.87s -> 13918.33s]  sun why can i not see it i'm gonna go in the sun i'm gonna go into the sun
[13919.37s -> 13924.89s]  no no no i refuse i fucking refuse i refuse to go into the sun i refuse to do it for like a 10th
[13924.89s -> 13955.78s]  time i refuse i refuse to do it no can't fuck out of here why can i not see this thing am i
[13955.78s -> 13974.25s]  losing my goddamn mind what am i going backwards what direction am i facing where are the planets
[13974.25s -> 13983.10s]  where are any planets what where did i go oh my god it out here i don't even know how i got this
[13983.10s -> 14007.05s]  way i'm but i went out into the skybox i think i was so don't fly into the sun please do not
[14007.05s -> 14040.89s]  autopilot sun me god waiter there's also a hanging city thing here too which is right above where
[14040.89s -> 14080.25s]  that guy rybeck is figure it out i guess okay now we attempt to find the thing i was trying to find
[14080.25s -> 14094.02s]  before is that cannon oh come on the hell is that holy shit wait i've never seen this before i've
[14094.02s -> 14099.85s]  never seen this before i've never seen this before what is this thing activate the gravity
[14099.85s -> 14105.38s]  cannon have i been here i've never been here before shuttle is currently rusting at the quantum
[14105.78s -> 14125.24s]  no i have yes i have wait it was it there's like three of these if it's like there's a couple of
[14125.24s -> 14135.70s]  these have i been to this one in particular though all right i'm gonna fire the cannon
[14138.90s -> 14154.33s]  bye i don't know i'm not sure where you're gonna go but hold on a minute wait at the very beginning
[14154.33s -> 14162.60s]  of the game the very beginning of the game somebody gets fired out on one of these cannons
[14163.24s -> 14181.61s]  what ship is it okay well bring it back cool all right shoot it again interesting
[14181.77s -> 14206.81s]  the crossroads yeah they've been over there where does this go southern observatory all right i
[14206.81s -> 14217.91s]  can't get in here can i and i get into the southern observatory from here that image is
[14217.91s -> 14225.16s]  psychological warfare i i'm not gonna click a link right now i'm busy i can't i have you have a
[14225.16s -> 14235.58s]  controller in my hand i'm gonna i'm just let's see what's over here i guess am i gonna make it
[14235.98s -> 14258.81s]  am i gonna make it across this is putting me where's this putting me why am i this is back
[14258.81s -> 14267.69s]  over here oh this is so confusing um i don't even know what i'm what i'm even looking for right now
[14268.94s -> 14317.74s]  actual wink southern observatory i can't even switch this now there's only one way i can go i
[14317.74s -> 14327.59s]  guess over here come from platform to platform wait what's that have i been over there
[14328.23s -> 14336.26s]  wait a minute hold on wait wait wait wait wait try jump i don't know if i can make that
[14342.33s -> 14345.69s]  black hole is there but can i make that that jump and then go into this
[14346.41s -> 14369.98s]  okay then this leads into this weird blue thing wait is that it i think that's it don't you fucking
[14369.98s -> 14390.89s]  dare kill me don't you dare kill me it almost did it almost just dropped on my head i need oxygen
[14390.89s -> 14421.42s]  but now where i don't know where to go why i can't even i like to squint to see actually
[14421.42s -> 14453.51s]  i'm like having trouble i can't i can't do this i can't do it i can't do it puke inducing i don't
[14453.51s -> 14472.26s]  think i can do it i can't do this i can't do it you can you can yes you can i can't i can't do it
[14472.26s -> 14503.03s]  jump okay one two and then to there i just i don't i don't i don't know what direction i'm supposed to
[14503.51s -> 14514.92s]  i'm just gonna try i don't know where i'm going but i'm gonna try and then jump into there
[14515.88s -> 14530.34s]  i made it this is inside the fucking circle i made it inside the bubble don't watch that
[14530.34s -> 14535.93s]  don't that's it looks like a fall hold on slow down what's in here a lot of info in here
[14536.81s -> 14546.49s]  lots of info when my dad and i were lifting orbital probe cannon components into orbit for
[14546.49s -> 14554.34s]  assembly and one somehow sank down beneath the current savva convinced me not to try to recreate
[14554.34s -> 14559.94s]  the phenomenon myself using the other cannon parts we're very curious to know what happened how could
[14559.94s -> 14566.39s]  something pass through the current my gratitude for your interesting question this is exciting
[14566.39s -> 14571.35s]  spire constructed a model of giants deep here at the brittle hollow southern observatory
[14572.71s -> 14580.79s]  and it reveals how an object might sink below the current you know i'm unable to grasp the
[14580.87s -> 14586.07s]  answer by looking through the projection pool if i visit the observatory would you kindly explain
[14587.03s -> 14593.86s]  you don't mind the trek beneath the surface to the south pole i'd be delighted to see you
[14593.86s -> 14600.14s]  the trailhead starts at brittle hollows equator right no you should have seen it we thought it
[14600.14s -> 14604.06s]  was impossible for any canon components to sink even partial below current but i sank straight
[14604.06s -> 14629.96s]  to the core all right i've seen this already this is the construction yard scam wink now i know i
[14629.96s -> 14647.19s]  can smell a scam from a mile away don't worry okay let's just keep going put tongue in there
[14647.19s -> 14654.14s]  stick tongue out savva's construction yard has been using the cyclones on giants deep to lift
[14654.14s -> 14660.62s]  orbitable probe cannon parts into orbit one component was pushed down past the current that
[14660.62s -> 14666.12s]  usually prevents anything from sinking by and are crafting a model to determine why this happened
[14667.00s -> 14670.04s]  an update it's now clear there are two different types of cyclone
[14670.04s -> 14676.74s]  one most cyclones on giants deep rotate clockwise these are the cyclones to savva typically use it
[14676.74s -> 14683.35s]  to send components into orbit there also exists a rarer type of cyclone that spins the opposite
[14683.35s -> 14691.19s]  direction pushes objects beneath the water and below the current my gratitude spire can always
[14691.19s -> 14696.63s]  showing me your handy work i'm intrigued by this secondary type of cyclone but was it really
[14696.63s -> 14703.32s]  necessary to build a model to tell me that the model will be useful as we continue monitoring
[14703.32s -> 14711.80s]  giants deep also i very much wanted to make a model for different kinds of cyclones one pushes
[14711.80s -> 14730.86s]  you down sit on your nose oh yeah where go up here and see if there's anything else
[14732.06s -> 14749.94s]  there's a lot of shit up here what is this uh teleporters let's see what have we learned
[14749.94s -> 14755.27s]  thus far in our search for the eye of the universe suppose the eye doesn't wish to be found
[14756.23s -> 14761.56s]  savva how can you suggest that the eye's signal called out to summon us to this star system
[14762.12s -> 14769.00s]  i'm aware i grew up hearing the eye's story if we're no closer to finding it than you were
[14769.00s -> 14774.97s]  when you first arrived here those of us on the vessel originally followed the eye's signal to
[14774.97s -> 14781.83s]  this star system but we were unable to warp to the eye itself the locator we built on the atl rock
[14781.83s -> 14787.99s]  and the new more sensitive locator we built here were both unable to detect any trace of the eye's
[14787.99s -> 14797.21s]  signal the eye has stopped emitting its signal it's an impersonator based on our knowledge of
[14797.21s -> 14803.53s]  the quantum moon we believe the eye is in orbit around this star system's sun this would mean
[14803.53s -> 14828.65s]  the eye is located within a finite range what is all this how should our methods change as we
[14828.65s -> 14834.10s]  continue our search for the eye of the universe we know what the eye looks like thanks to the
[14834.10s -> 14838.18s]  quantum moon so what if we try to find the eye visually instead let's send out a probe
[14839.14s -> 14844.94s]  alo's idea is covered but we have no idea where the eye is in relation to here the probability
[14844.94s -> 14851.06s]  of launching a probe in the correct direction would be absurdly small i believe i have a solution
[14851.06s -> 14854.66s]  for that problem have you spoken with rami and pi about the technology they're developing
[14856.26s -> 14861.91s]  we need to build a probe launching mechanism to cover those long distances quickly and in an
[14861.91s -> 14868.28s]  orbit around a celestial body would circumvent the need to escape gravity's pull giant steve
[14868.28s -> 14873.32s]  would be a good choice it's furthest from the sun so we'll provide the best angles for launch
[14873.32s -> 14879.16s]  and it's moonless except when the quantum moon is visiting yes let's build the cannon in orbit
[14879.16s -> 14883.48s]  around giant steve we couldn't find the eye signal using two different devices built for
[14883.48s -> 14890.57s]  this exact purpose we should discontinue this search method couldn't figure it out
[14898.68s -> 14902.84s]  this whole this whole thing is all fucked up we're gonna zoom out we're gonna be like inside of a
[14902.84s -> 14907.56s]  pupil of a baby you know what i mean it's probably something like that whatever what does this do
[14908.68s -> 14942.50s]  this do okay well that's where all the that's where everything is so that one is all right
[14942.50s -> 14955.14s]  let's get the whole thing out oh it's an atom i figured it out this is the quantum moons location
[14955.14s -> 14965.77s]  it could be anywhere it could be anywhere look at all these different orbiting paths
[14970.74s -> 14977.77s]  all right i've done it i've did everything in the observatory now i have to go down a
[14977.77s -> 14995.66s]  cyclone down to the bottom of the ocean what's down here can i go in there no where does this
[14995.66s -> 15006.36s]  lead mary i did it to put the ship down yeah we already saw this and he was like i don't know why
[15006.36s -> 15018.14s]  i can't get in here all right that's done i wish that was my ship god damn it it's not
[15018.14s -> 15033.37s]  not now we got to go to don't die um maybe i should just die
[15042.28s -> 15063.83s]  yeah just die i know where to go now yeah it's going to be a baby's eyes are going to open and
[15063.83s -> 15071.29s]  it's not it's not going to be a video game it's going to zoom out of a in real life video of an
[15071.85s -> 15076.89s]  actual baby it's going to zoom out of their closed eye and they're going to open their eye and it's
[15076.89s -> 15080.97s]  going to be right when they were born and inside of their eye you can see all the planets and shit
[15081.77s -> 15106.42s]  loaded into the computer tornado situation southern observatory so this is um this is complete
[15106.42s -> 15110.34s]  the only thing that's missing is the ocean depths which i now know how to do
[15111.54s -> 15118.18s]  i just have to this looks pretty clean there's only really the ash twin project is the main thing
[15119.30s -> 15125.06s]  and this probe i'm sure i'll unlock these two and then we only have a few things down here and
[15125.06s -> 15145.59s]  that's it isn't it okay all right guys deep let's get sucked into a an actual tornado
[15146.15s -> 15160.07s]  time to get sucked in i pay left he's on the tutorial galaxy
[15179.24s -> 15188.31s]  all right find me one of these things okay they all spin in one direction one's not
[15188.31s -> 15197.30s]  spinning in the same direction see if we can find it now should i go in there with the ship
[15197.30s -> 15213.13s]  i think i'm gonna go in there with the ship so what direction you're both spinning
[15214.17s -> 15225.66s]  you're both going that's going the other direction which one of these is going the
[15225.66s -> 15248.18s]  other direction found it in the back there you are you're not going in the same direction
[15249.14s -> 15281.59s]  go ahead and throw us down sir here we go okay we oh there it is now now what i don't want to
[15281.59s -> 15291.99s]  touch this i feel like i shouldn't touch this it's electricity in water why would i want to touch it
[15292.71s -> 15324.12s]  i'm going in you can't i can't go in um wait hold on i remember i remember i remember inside
[15324.12s -> 15331.08s]  of a jellyfish you are protected from electricity one of the only fucking things i remember
[15334.15s -> 15342.92s]  all right i need a jellyfish is that the only one that's here or is there one closer in here
[15342.92s -> 15355.74s]  this one over there can i get this thing to have to kill it all right i'm gonna drive into it and
[15355.74s -> 15376.81s]  kill it okay is it dead i think i killed it it's still electrified how do you kill it inside of
[15376.81s -> 15394.49s]  this if you're inside of a jellyfish you won't get electrocuted how do i get in there what the
[15394.49s -> 15403.37s]  fuck oh my chest you can explode underwater what i don't like my ship exploded underwater
[15409.80s -> 15435.13s]  i can't touch the jellyfish how do i get inside the jellyfish then what did that guy say he said
[15435.13s -> 15444.84s]  oh yeah it tastes horrible but what was his actual okay yeah i found that but he had like
[15444.84s -> 15459.30s]  where's like the log i see something i don't know view entries no no it's the other one
[15459.30s -> 15490.14s]  this one okay it doesn't help me i'll try it again if i climb in it though won't that just
[15490.14s -> 15507.85s]  electrocute me when i touch it see what happens they'll haven't done anything really bad
[15509.53s -> 15524.26s]  let's go yeah it in my brain do i have to hit the jellyfish in the head
[15525.22s -> 15547.14s]  where there's no electricity or get out of the ship and stand on its head i'll try climbing in
[15548.34s -> 15556.47s]  i'll get out of the ship and i'll try to climb inside but there's nothing to climb in it's closed
[15556.47s -> 15603.82s]  it's like closed up there's nothing like i can go in where is it i can't climb electricity no you can't
[15605.90s -> 15613.10s]  i'm gonna take another look down there i'm gonna go to the bottom
[15614.06s -> 15623.77s]  let's see the fish let's go all the way to the bottom i don't think this ship is gonna
[15623.77s -> 15635.67s]  explode or anything but is there is there a bottom just this is not just sitting on the
[15635.67s -> 15642.26s]  bottom of the ocean it's down here okay i don't let me see all right we got jellyfish jellyfish
[15642.26s -> 15662.14s]  going in jellyfish going in that one goes in oh he's going in for a dunk all right uh wait
[15664.70s -> 15693.27s]  i swim through that that's me can i swim into that when he's done why is it it's leaving that
[15693.27s -> 15705.94s]  trail it's leaving that red spot it has to be can't be for no reason this i think the ship is too big
[15705.94s -> 15726.68s]  to do that isn't it let me get full fuel and oxygen everything i got 20 minutes don't worry
[15727.48s -> 15751.98s]  i should be able to swim through that after they go in hold on i got an idea why do i think i can't
[15751.98s -> 15758.47s]  touch the jellyfish because i if they're electrified and i bounced off i'm trying
[15758.47s -> 15780.98s]  this even if it doesn't work i don't care i'm just trying to why don't you just touch the jellyfish
[15781.54s -> 15803.22s]  what's wrong with you why can't what do you why do you think you can't that didn't fucking work
[15816.90s -> 15856.74s]  damn it now the ship got all the way back to the surface why all right we're gonna try to swim
[15857.46s -> 15893.06s]  inside am i in it am i in all right i'll give you one reason why this is i don't like this
[15893.86s -> 15902.74s]  because how is this this is not electrified is everything else is but like in under here isn't
[15913.62s -> 15937.78s]  we in i can't see anything are we in i don't even know if we're in oh we're in we're in right all
[15937.78s -> 15947.75s]  right get out holy shit okay i'm in what's up and what's down my flashlight doesn't work in here
[15947.75s -> 15977.50s]  what is that thing that's an eye and i go in it why my flashlight not work what's this this is
[15977.50s -> 15998.95s]  the can okay this is i'm gonna go in this way it's the eye of the universe holy shit i'm flying
[15998.95s -> 16062.15s]  around all right hold on i don't want it wants to come in my room i gotta get out hold on okay
[16063.19s -> 16084.44s]  hello dog hello i tell he's good he's on his pillow he's chilling on his pillow
[16084.44s -> 16109.50s]  well whatever but how do i do this i have no audio all right so here we are new content new content
[16109.50s -> 16135.40s]  is this the probe so wait a minute is this anything in here no i know you're reading show
[16135.40s -> 16142.20s]  auto i i can't the camera's like to i'll show them later i promise i gotta get through this
[16142.20s -> 16148.36s]  i have exciting news the ash twin project is always prepared to receive the probe data
[16148.36s -> 16159.22s]  from the orbital probe cannon liar oh no i can't i got like documents all over the ground
[16159.86s -> 16165.46s]  i got hold on i've got hold on i've got documents all over the ground i swear to god
[16165.46s -> 16175.10s]  there's documents everywhere and i have like insanely personal info i got so many
[16175.10s -> 16191.88s]  fucking documents everywhere they're surrounding me what is this another document
[16196.62s -> 16209.96s]  fancy desk with documents on the floor you don't understand my my fancy desk in quotes for what
[16209.96s -> 16217.51s]  you're saying is there's three monitors okay i'm gonna show i don't wait i'm gonna get he's all
[16217.51s -> 16224.73s]  he's all the way across the room hold on fucking documents everywhere i accidentally show one of
[16224.73s -> 16230.65s]  these documents i'm gonna be so mad no we got more documents over here i can't
[16233.06s -> 16243.51s]  i think the room's covered in documents i swear god i think i think i've cleared the room of all
[16243.51s -> 16259.99s]  documents ready for your close-up auto here we go
[16262.78s -> 16285.18s]  hard decision to do this hold on wait i see a stray document
[16285.82s -> 16333.03s]  documents we're good i was looking at me like what the hell are you doing i was you can't see
[16333.59s -> 16363.42s]  i can see a document guys i can't fucking move because one inch to your right is a bank document
[16364.38s -> 16373.86s]  i'm good there you go that's my special dog i saw it no you didn't clean your room i just it's just
[16373.86s -> 16409.21s]  a bank document i'm good there you go that's my special dog i saw it no you didn't clean your room
[16409.21s -> 16416.95s]  clean your room it's just documents it's not like it's like shitty diapers or something it's fine
[16417.99s -> 16430.33s]  all right here we go i'm exciting news the astron project is almost prepared to receive the probe
[16431.13s -> 16437.50s]  remy is adding some finishing touches here but she'll be finished soon are you are you in the
[16437.50s -> 16446.01s]  orbital probe cannon well we are the probe tracking module is ready to record each launches flight
[16446.01s -> 16453.99s]  trajectory and will automatically transmit all relevant data to you on other appendage i'm now
[16453.99s -> 16459.62s]  worried about this canon structural integrity and its cruise moral integrity once the probe
[16459.62s -> 16463.54s]  determines the location of the eye of the universe i'll send an alert directly to you and remy
[16464.18s -> 16489.03s]  we already saw this but let's do this let's go into the quicksand and okay this is the eye of
[16489.03s -> 16514.15s]  the universe like whatever this is this is the eye of the universe what else is in here imagine
[16514.15s -> 16518.15s]  privet the probe tracking module will be the first to know the coordinates of the eye of the universe
[16518.95s -> 16526.14s]  you'll be the first to see them i am honored and terrified you won't ask the orbit of a
[16526.14s -> 16531.70s]  probe cannon to use so much power that it breaks will you fret not my nervous friend we only need
[16531.70s -> 16536.82s]  to fire the probe once who minds if it compromises the canon structural integrity i think we read
[16536.82s -> 16542.68s]  this one i would mind malo i would mind because we won't be capable of receiving our probes data if
[16542.68s -> 16568.86s]  the probe tracking module is destroyed so where's the data where's the data is that very explodes
[16569.42s -> 16597.27s]  oh whoa whoa no no no no this way where you going over here okay so here comes the data spear
[16605.90s -> 16619.59s]  uh day pot has redeemed bernie sanders okay the 34 000 points okay retrieving data from probe 9406
[16620.31s -> 16664.87s]  visualizing current trajectory of probe 9406 with data all right that's what the sixth location
[16664.87s -> 16674.76s]  looks like retrieving previous launch data from ash twin for probes launch 9406
[16675.64s -> 16679.24s]  deep space anomaly matching all known criteria for the eye of the universe
[16679.24s -> 16702.62s]  bird of universe found by probe 9354 somebody found it retrieving stored coordinates from ash twin
[16703.50s -> 16729.14s]  displaying coordinates for the eye of the universe screenshot it okay it's c or like an l
[16730.52s -> 16739.74s]  uh l a well what was that just blew by whatever i'll know i guess somebody will remember it
[16739.74s -> 16743.93s]  oops okay so i got i got the i got the coordinates for the eye of the universe
[16744.49s -> 16762.12s]  i have the coordinates for the eye of the universe i got it it's i did it let's go all right can you
[16762.12s -> 16787.51s]  stop doing that for me all right if you could stop doing that it'd be very nice okay all right
[16788.23s -> 16798.07s]  i i know the location of the eye of the universe anything else down here that i need to look at or
[16798.07s -> 16847.43s]  see i don't think there's anything else in here the tree i think i think i got everything i needed
[16848.07s -> 16858.89s]  i'm not sure there's anything else to do it's just this weird tree core all right let's go
[16859.53s -> 16877.06s]  let's just get electrocuted to death i could have swam through the whole time
[16877.06s -> 16914.76s]  i already tried that yeah okay out is okay i guess all right where's my ship
[16925.45s -> 16926.17s]  doing over here
[16939.13s -> 16946.74s]  all right let's deposit this data let's see we get probe tracking module all this has been
[16947.46s -> 16959.45s]  revealed i have the coordinates of the eye of the universe there's only one or two real outliers
[16959.45s -> 16967.08s]  here and it's this shit at ash twin project and black hole forge and then the hanging city and
[16967.08s -> 16995.24s]  then this anglerfish fossil you don't have any more info on this go to ash twin by this point
[16996.20s -> 17013.72s]  most of the sand will be gone right so i can kind of explore hold on a second
[17034.55s -> 17039.11s]  oh i forgot the big gravity in this after that i forgot the gravity the huge gravity in this planet
[17040.55s -> 17056.58s]  yeah i can't get the ship i can't get back in the ship now no longer have access to the
[17057.46s -> 17101.93s]  getting sucked away by the current i'm trying to jump i'm trying to fucking die
[17101.93s -> 17124.52s]  i can't even die correctly just throw me in the air and let me just go die somewhere
[17126.84s -> 17146.42s]  thank god the fucking sun's about to explode i can't even go forward please just throw me here
[17147.46s -> 17152.10s]  why are you not throwing what i'm standing inside of this tornado why am i not going up
[17152.10s -> 17168.20s]  you can't suck me up that's the down that's the own that's the down one it's the down one of
[17168.20s -> 17186.33s]  course it is blow up so i can please i wish i could delete that water effect
[17207.99s -> 17222.06s]  we need a good view i don't know if there is a good view there's kind of a view there it comes
[17222.06s -> 17281.18s]  been a while to get here well i did learn a lot so that's good progress when you're gonna do nancy
[17281.18s -> 17293.32s]  drew i don't do like an hour please note do not hold any of these terms accountable for germa
[17293.32s -> 17320.07s]  he's not going to do these things okay i want to go to the ash twin yep i think that's what i would
[17320.07s -> 17329.18s]  like to do i still haven't figured out what this thing even does or why it exists i just know it's
[17329.18s -> 17367.05s]  here you lied about fl studio yeah i did i'll take that one i did eye of the universe the twin
[17367.69s -> 17412.55s]  project thing land on it let's go all right now i'm just gonna make sure that i have enough
[17413.27s -> 17422.39s]  remember you still as confused as me about this game i have a very basic understanding of what's
[17422.39s -> 17432.20s]  going on but an incredibly basic understanding of what's going on there's this group of alien
[17432.20s -> 17441.30s]  people who wanted to find the eye of the universe and it wiped them out and they may have wiped out
[17441.30s -> 17450.14s]  everything here which also wiped us out the ship oh no the ship's gonna get grabbed no the ship's
[17450.14s -> 17461.18s]  gonna get grabbed by this this happens to me every time oh come on why i'm going for it
[17461.90s -> 17497.24s]  we're going so fast just get on the beam okay we're good okay good heel
[17497.24s -> 17535.30s]  okay good very good very good excellent hey we burnt some time hey i wonder if that
[17535.30s -> 17543.62s]  uh sand plant it's a little lower than it was before this time make sure it's not in the
[17543.62s -> 17569.86s]  trajectory of the sand it'd be very nice if you did that and get over there oh i'm not gonna land
[17569.86s -> 17610.76s]  on the equator again i'm not gonna land on the equator waiting for it to come by this is where
[17610.76s -> 17624.70s]  i want to be i don't care just crash don't land on a fucking equator okay right here is good
[17625.10s -> 17646.70s]  let's see what happens two on either side of this planet when this goes to zero it triggers the
[17646.70s -> 17653.82s]  event when all the sand is gone it triggers the event to bring me back to life with the cactus
[17653.82s -> 17675.30s]  jump no you're not dead i will be this whole this is where the masks are stored which is where i
[17675.30s -> 17690.04s]  you store the memories of the last person just control my breathing just hang out for a little
[17690.04s -> 17705.02s]  bit do i try cactus jump all right i'll try cactus jump no no i'm not gonna do that
[17722.30s -> 17747.86s]  there's this which i still don't know exactly what this is for let's get a look at it
[17748.50s -> 17783.62s]  i know some some ancient town i don't know cactus was this person here before is it cactus
[17804.36s -> 17810.84s]  all right i gotta be careful this is in the trajectory this is in the trajectory of
[17811.80s -> 17821.66s]  i can't get in no yeah i gotta put the ship all right it's starting to let me get in the ship
[17825.56s -> 17843.78s]  get the hell out of here here it comes all right what this has got to be some entrance
[17845.82s -> 17852.47s]  pumpkin smasher pumpkin smasher just gave a hundred dollars another ten thousand bit donation to
[17852.47s -> 17860.04s]  stream ridiculous you guys are crazy giving that much money but holy fuck thank you
[17861.16s -> 17867.00s]  10 000 bits huge bits they say hey jerma show your beautiful face for the rest of the stream

[18271.85s -> 18322.07s]  sand it's all right he's right here how much time passes when you do this that was off five six seven
[18322.79s -> 18334.30s]  wait wait wait wait wait are these minutes or second hold on is it i was gonna say holy shit
[18334.30s -> 18371.13s]  that's going fast what should i do 10 minutes okay that's about two i'm gonna do more do another
[18371.13s -> 18410.73s]  like three or four three just sleep until the supernova happens that would be so bad
[18412.41s -> 18420.01s]  i chart oh it's you i have a question for you i found something i found uh right isn't this time
[18420.01s -> 18429.08s]  supposed to freeze i don't know that much of what's out there okay question for you um where should
[18429.08s -> 18433.72s]  i explore i haven't left this lake bed have you seen the old shipwreck on ember's twin southern
[18433.72s -> 18440.92s]  hemisphere oh yeah i think i've already done that i don't have time for this i found something i
[18440.92s -> 18444.52s]  found uh the quantum moon everyone loves a good mystery all right i don't have time for this i
[18444.52s -> 18476.79s]  literally don't have time to talk to you bye goodbye all right i'm going back but i looked
[18476.79s -> 18479.67s]  over and saw that the satellite part had barely even gotten uh breached
[18480.63s -> 18504.73s]  so here we go so there is all kinds of shit in here now which one what do i go to this or here
[18505.85s -> 18524.14s]  i'm not sure what i should do first what are you doing
[18526.38s -> 18535.72s]  okay what do i do what should i do first something over with the satellite things
[18536.68s -> 18560.09s]  it's still going but one of those other buildings to go in what under here look anything under here
[18560.09s -> 18601.08s]  yet really this tower anything else on the surface level on this one it's still going though
[18605.10s -> 18634.44s]  dark don't please stop stop stop look at all this shit but this there's nothing down here
[18640.02s -> 18668.34s]  um just i just wanted to see what was beneath the sand okay i think this is stop
[18669.54s -> 18680.70s]  still going not still going i can go in here the door opened in here
[18681.42s -> 18688.54s]  there's an opening who cares this brings me to the top where i have no idea where it was before
[18689.34s -> 18709.85s]  i've already been up here this is the bridge this shit is coming in it's coming in right now it's
[18709.85s -> 18727.88s]  gonna it's gonna do the same thing i did last time does this eventually get something at the base
[18728.60s -> 18756.20s]  something deep buried in here no idea i've already been up top here we go yeah i've been up top
[18756.20s -> 18787.96s]  before here's the entrance is dropping anymore it still is is there anything else in the bottom of
[18787.96s -> 18793.74s]  this chip is gone well i mean we have like three minutes before it ends i'm not leaving this planet
[18795.45s -> 18802.01s]  all right so this is now what happens if i is there only and i have to go up the middle
[18802.89s -> 18814.17s]  but haven't i already been up here yeah i've already been up here
[18814.73s -> 18826.47s]  this doesn't do anything for me well now i'm gonna be able to see everything
[18827.11s -> 18835.37s]  what the fuck is down there all right it's just like the meatball i'm just i'm this is the meatball
[18835.37s -> 18862.60s]  core okay right in here i already went in here i have absolutely no idea what's going on
[18863.88s -> 18878.25s]  like the sun's about to explode gotta go in the cactus tower there's no more sand before
[18881.48s -> 18897.32s]  in here right in here and walk up this now i can walk down this done this already though
[18897.32s -> 18903.06s]  what the fuck is this what is this bro what is that hey hey hey hey no no what have i
[18911.66s -> 18924.33s]  get in there here's the first delivery warp fresh from the black hole forge
[18925.21s -> 18939.75s]  ash 209 i've been here before i think once yeah i've been here once you go to meet at the station
[18940.39s -> 18971.88s]  i've been here once yeah i didn't learn anything so there's other buildings that are on that equator
[18972.52s -> 18998.95s]  how many more there keep going with the same ones everything just kind of blends together
[19000.07s -> 19033.22s]  let me look at the notes all right uh yes they did they want to know if a 22 minute negative
[19033.22s -> 19046.58s]  time and if it was possible they can clue yeah yeah yeah yeah designs for each of the towers
[19046.58s -> 19050.66s]  and ashton's equator each tower warps through a different planet these towers are done to
[19050.66s -> 19066.34s]  visually reflect its warp destination yeah but all right i'm gonna go back and i'm just gonna
[19066.34s -> 19090.41s]  ride the equator right cactus tower again maybe all right so you know the problem is is this planet
[19090.41s -> 19098.50s]  always starts just just a circle so it's it it's not like everything gradually comes out of the
[19098.50s -> 19120.90s]  ground let me try to get to the cat i don't remember where the cactus from is is it one of
[19120.90s -> 19141.45s]  the equator ones it was part of the equator wasn't it so it's both the poles of these giant
[19142.73s -> 19176.46s]  huge satellite things i'm not on the equator right good all right so where what where's that
[19176.46s -> 19210.31s]  cactus where's the cactus one on the equator too fast this is all right let's go get in all right
[19210.31s -> 19214.23s]  this is literally right in the middle on the equator and okay i know what it looks like it's
[19214.23s -> 19223.56s]  good it's a weird like star shape i can't get in there yet i need an entrance besides the entrance
[19223.56s -> 19257.77s]  gonna be on cactus run hard mode there it is open come on hurry up is it broken this fucking thing's
[19257.77s -> 19304.22s]  broken i can't it's right here that's not it's gonna cross over on me all right it is immediately
[19304.22s -> 19335.66s]  to the right cactus room go through the cactuses be careful go oh shit wait what's that do i didn't
[19335.66s -> 19359.66s]  do anything what's this what's that what's this somebody said look up at the ground
[19361.18s -> 19383.30s]  how do you look up at the ground i knew we were gonna fucking pour it into the sun station i knew
[19383.30s -> 19393.37s]  it i told you i told you guys i knew it but when i freaked out and started screaming about this game
[19393.37s -> 19397.21s]  and i was like there's no fucking way i have to do this there's no way i have to fucking port i knew
[19397.21s -> 19407.83s]  it 81 000 years ago no user commands received for 10 minutes all systems entering sleep six
[19407.83s -> 19411.91s]  minutes 40 seconds increased solar activity detected sun station hull integrity approaching
[19411.91s -> 19433.26s]  critical levels closing emergency doors opens the emergency door um i didn't want to do that
[19434.14s -> 19452.02s]  i didn't want to do that no no no no i didn't think i didn't know that was i didn't know opening
[19452.02s -> 19459.67s]  the fucking door oh my god i'm gonna be i'm gonna scream opening the door and walking forward it was
[19459.67s -> 19475.43s]  a trap you have to actually float into the other room that's so finicky and so annoying to do that
[19476.15s -> 19512.42s]  holy shit i'd rather drive there with my ship do it then i don't get any new info oh at least i know
[19512.42s -> 19566.81s]  how to what to do now it's cactus rooming fuck me i'm so close to learning the secret
[19567.85s -> 19576.30s]  why am i going so what's going whoa whoa whoa i'll tell you i'll tell you use it star wars it star
[19576.30s -> 19620.71s]  wars it i'm fine can you please where am i in the equator so okay here's just a car wash
[19621.27s -> 19641.54s]  there's just a car wash we're fine give me off the equator all right in two
[19645.16s -> 19650.28s]  i'm not back on the equator i'm not back on the equator i moved away from the equator
[19656.18s -> 19661.94s]  oh my god okay let's get back to the cactus tower and i gotta float into this
[19665.40s -> 19669.32s]  you want to chill by the camp nope i don't i'm not i'm staying right here
[19669.96s -> 19673.56s]  this is where i'm gonna be this is my this is my spot this is where i'm gonna be for a little while

[20640.30s -> 20652.38s]  that just hold a walk out and hold a don't press anything match velocity station can't be targeted
[20652.38s -> 20662.94s]  just don't press any buttons i'm not gonna press anything but what about you were wrong you were
[20662.94s -> 20686.63s]  wrong no i got it okay i got it okay i made it mission science compels us to explore the sun
[20691.02s -> 20694.70s]  can't we change this i don't enjoy working in view of such a morbid mission statement
[20695.42s -> 20703.42s]  but it's accurate we're going to create a supernova for the purpose of scientific progress
[20703.42s -> 20708.86s]  that's our mission the mission is to decide if such an irresponsible feat is even possible so
[20708.86s -> 20716.09s]  they did it here's a better one mission determine if it's possible to prompt the sun to explode why
[20716.33s -> 20723.88s]  why do they want the sun to why are you doing this you lack a sense of humor at least i don't
[20723.88s -> 20730.33s]  lack a sense of ethics kindly refrain from going supernova on me before the sun does
[20733.93s -> 20756.50s]  oh you're dead why the masks little go-karts wait are they like bugs is this like a person lying
[20756.50s -> 20762.02s]  down with like weird beetle people or is that just like a storage unit i don't know i don't know i
[20762.02s -> 20768.62s]  saw a guy wearing one of these all right let's go let's go in i could go up but let's go down
[20768.62s -> 20775.58s]  first wait that's the sun is down there sun's down there the sun is in there let's go up
[20799.99s -> 20835.32s]  uh this happened to me what is going on what i didn't run out of time
[20836.28s -> 20845.99s]  ran out of time the supernova didn't happen the sun was expand well i'm trying to like explore
[20847.94s -> 20853.14s]  okay on the back of the game's cereal box it's like explore everything and look at stuff and read
[20853.14s -> 20866.30s]  stuff i had to go down well how am i okay how am i supposed to know i was supposed to go down
[20867.26s -> 20879.75s]  first i want there was a way to go up all right i don't have that info we're gonna do it again
[20880.31s -> 20888.58s]  there's a setting that pauses time while reading why is that not enabled automatically
[20891.56s -> 20917.37s]  it is it is it is it's on all right let me do this again i just i i i turned around like five
[20917.37s -> 20926.46s]  fucking times where the hell am i going i have to do this should we use the you i go i'm gonna use
[20926.46s -> 20940.76s]  the fire yeah what was that don't do that don't do what are you talking about wait what are you
[20940.76s -> 20943.56s]  why is everybody goes don't do that what was that noise what do you mean what noise are you talking
[20947.94s -> 20982.26s]  that noise not you oh i was like what like there's a noise in my room slow it down
[20984.02s -> 20996.95s]  okay we're on the equator i'm on the equator every time am i yes i am move it out of the way
[20996.95s -> 21006.38s]  right here should be good like right here please would stop rolling the fuck around
[21019.85s -> 21026.09s]  use the campfire at the start yo signal boost this shit yeah retweet it everybody retweet it
[21046.89s -> 21064.06s]  where is it retweet at the campfire how's it not popped up yet all right you guys see any good
[21064.06s -> 21088.31s]  movies stand here no i have to go into the sun i have to float over there again and you saw how
[21088.31s -> 21093.75s]  horrendous that was i have to do that again i was so hoping i was never gonna have to do that ever
[21093.75s -> 21114.18s]  fucking again and i have to do it again match velocity i can't because you have to have something
[21114.18s -> 21117.94s]  to target to match the velocity i will match the velocity of the sun and fly right into it
[21119.22s -> 21138.97s]  okay here we go passes through and then we go don't touch anything that's what i did last time
[21138.97s -> 21187.37s]  it was a disaster and i ended up just freaking out and fixing it let's go okay one two three
[21187.37s -> 21196.81s]  three that's bullshit you're right that's ridiculous just just ridiculous just ridiculous
[21198.17s -> 21221.37s]  oh i have to do the jump all right i'll get it you're gonna be falling to the sun for fun
[21221.37s -> 21248.63s]  elbert said stop saying that um i'm gonna say why did it not work okay left trigger right trigger
[21249.19s -> 21293.83s]  right trigger left trigger right trigger and then go down here we go go down what's in here
[21294.89s -> 21303.94s]  uh read star has reached out end of natural life cycle now approaching red giant stage warning
[21303.94s -> 21311.27s]  evacuate sun station approximate time until sun station is destroyed by expanding star four
[21311.27s -> 21330.87s]  minutes nine seconds approximate time until star's death 15 minutes and 39 seconds i need a disc what
[21330.95s -> 21337.06s]  happened to the sun station not fire it fired yarrow but it failed the sun barely responded
[21337.06s -> 21342.74s]  there were infinitesimally small surface level changes but they were barely visible even to the
[21342.74s -> 21351.75s]  third eye the sun station is useless it will never and could never cause the sun to explode
[21352.63s -> 21358.02s]  i don't know what comes next my friends i suppose we must start over but i'm unsure how to start
[21358.02s -> 21366.09s]  over don't i do it uh return to ash twin first my friend perhaps a change of task would help
[21366.09s -> 21370.01s]  aspire notice to comet approaching this star system that we'd like to investigate
[21371.93s -> 21379.93s]  hi i hurt for you my friends we all know how hard you both work i can only offer my compassion how
[21379.93s -> 21387.29s]  are you how is it idea we're well yarrow or as well as can be expected given the circumstances
[21387.29s -> 21392.33s]  though disappointed may have disagreed with exploding the sun but i never wish the device
[21392.33s -> 21416.84s]  would fail and hope their terrible work was finished i mean that wait hold on these are all
[21416.84s -> 21422.14s]  people standing around me these are all people standing around a circle and they're all standing
[21422.14s -> 21445.50s]  around me is that it is there anything else i can do in here uh we're gonna die run run
[21499.34s -> 21510.55s]  what did they even do for me i just they tried to explode the sun with the sun station and then
[21511.35s -> 21522.84s]  the comet they wanted to use the comet instead so the comet is what's making the sun explode
[21522.84s -> 21541.06s]  but why how the sun station done the sun was designed the sun station is going to make the
[21541.06s -> 21546.18s]  sun go supernova the nomai fired the sun station but it had no effect on the sun they concluded
[21546.18s -> 21551.38s]  the sun station can never cause the sun to go supernova the failure of the sun station the nomai
[21551.38s -> 21556.10s]  took a break to investigate the newly arrived comet according to a nomai computer our sun has
[21556.10s -> 21580.14s]  reached the end of its natural life cycle okay i still don't get what i do how what do i do about
[21580.14s -> 21590.31s]  this ash twin project all the memories are recorded through a storage unit within ash twin
[21591.27s -> 21612.06s]  there's also this coal forge in the hanging city what course the black hole forage there's a huge
[21612.06s -> 21620.62s]  nomai city just the north all right i'm gonna try this i'm gonna do this so this is right above
[21620.62s -> 21625.02s]  ribex campsite i'm gonna find ribex we're gonna do this tomorrow let's just crash and die
[21651.18s -> 21677.88s]  try to get out you're gonna fall into the fun for son elbertson
[21679.96s -> 21698.44s]  right going back to diablo 2 yeah on saturday saturday is going to be diablo 2
[21700.71s -> 21712.97s]  hardcore we're going to try to kill diablo we need to go to uh it's uh ribex campsite is in
[21713.77s -> 21727.70s]  the what is it the hollow what's it called riddle something you act like diablo is the end but we
[21727.70s -> 21743.02s]  know this in act five um yeah i know that too i have to beat diablo though i have to kill diablo
[21743.02s -> 21762.82s]  first tomorrow's tony hawke underground the xbox 360 hard drive has come in and it's saturday's
[21762.82s -> 21770.63s]  diablo 2 hardcore and depending on how how depending on how poorly that goes
[21772.22s -> 21781.10s]  probably finished sir is wrath too bilateral itch just gave five tons of fucking money tonight
[21781.10s -> 21785.34s]  huge five five thousand five thousand ten thousand ten thousand ten thousand ten thousand bits you
[21785.34s -> 21795.03s]  guys are fucking going nuts thanks guys seriously that's a shitload of money i like to imagine the
[21795.03s -> 21806.33s]  god of this game is watching just like what the fuck is this guy doing and what and they are just
[21806.33s -> 21813.74s]  blowing it up every time they're just they're doing it they're just like you know every 20
[21813.74s -> 21818.62s]  minutes see if we can figure out where i am i'm gonna find the eye of the universe see if you
[21818.62s -> 21825.00s]  can find me good luck all right we're gonna find uh right there but thank you phylactery
[21828.22s -> 21846.20s]  five thousand bits like he's like in the core but i gotta go yeah i gotta go down that weird
[21847.48s -> 21889.10s]  there's a spot i can sneak in there it is all right let's go down almighty god in chat
[21890.68s -> 21903.69s]  good god human dev in chat cool hey dude um why did uh not we can ask questions about the game
[21903.69s -> 21916.95s]  why did you give us fingernails what was the point of that he's over there i can't just how
[21916.95s -> 21922.89s]  do i get over there reliably how do i get over there reliably without just jumping and dying
[21923.53s -> 21934.70s]  i could go down here but how far does it bring me i'm not gonna jump where does this bring me
[21935.26s -> 21952.02s]  he's right there right there all right i think i can actually jump from here and land in there
[21952.74s -> 21974.25s]  no i don't ah okay it's above ryback right so ryback is there the hanging city is here like up
[21974.25s -> 22002.15s]  here i'm gonna okay i'm gonna turn up here so what like this way like up there or right there
[22002.79s -> 22033.19s]  how do i get over there how do i get the ridge like go that way i know i'm looking at the funnel
[22033.19s -> 22080.23s]  but like i just i want to make sure i'm doing this right okay and then this way did you did you guys
[22080.23s -> 22093.02s]  just more huge bits hayden clip fell 10 000 in kxc 50 at the same exact time have fun space cowboy
[22093.58s -> 22106.89s]  thank you guys both of you god that's a shitload of money thank you all of you that's too much
[22107.69s -> 22117.64s]  hanging city co-op bits something like that oh well that was deeply unpleasant i made it this
[22117.64s -> 22121.72s]  far though i guess that's the part to focus on and not how i'll eventually have to get back up that
[22121.72s -> 22127.08s]  path wow this place sure is something looks like the hanging city is north from here and east is
[22127.08s -> 22132.73s]  a gravity cannon i definitely want to see that another thing i'm detecting oxygen from somewhere
[22132.73s -> 22137.45s]  below which is good since i uh used up a lot of my supply screaming during the trip from the surface
[22138.25s -> 22142.62s]  as i stop driving heaving i'm gonna head further down below so i can refill my tank
[22143.42s -> 22160.66s]  what's this say gravity cannon yep let's check it out let's check it out hanging city
[22161.38s -> 22194.31s]  i don't want to use any fuel or anything i'm scared to use fuel i'm not gonna get hit in the
[22194.31s -> 22219.90s]  head with that boulder am i school district melt water district eye shrine district
[22221.88s -> 22248.30s]  black hole forge district i need air i'm what black hole forge i need air somewhere
[22248.30s -> 22249.42s]  we're gonna get it there you go
[22250.22s -> 22256.23s]  oh
[22283.29s -> 22313.58s]  okay i guess i plugged it in hold on this text here the ashtron project requires a powerful
[22313.58s -> 22338.10s]  highly advanced warp core how should we obtain it we could craft a new advanced warp core inspired
[22338.10s -> 22344.68s]  by the vessel's warp core abandoning the vessel's warp core and its casing means losing valuable
[22344.68s -> 22349.88s]  knowledge this is true however its knowledge we have little hope for covering it would be best
[22349.88s -> 22356.06s]  to relearn i think i'd very much like to craft such a powerful core more relevantly i believe
[22356.06s -> 22363.13s]  the black hole forge crew and i could recreate the basic design is the safest path for our plan
[22364.09s -> 22369.75s]  is the safest path the best best one or our goal is worth the risk is it though we've tried for so
[22369.75s -> 22375.75s]  long to find something that i and others now believe might be possible to find what are they
[22375.75s -> 22384.74s]  doing here now can i just be honest what the hell are they doing here i can find the eye we
[22384.74s -> 22392.14s]  would find the eye why because we have to why do you have to because that's what we do why
[22393.83s -> 22405.14s]  that's what we do if we do that's what i've been yeah the greatest challenge here i think is we
[22405.14s -> 22408.58s]  don't have to design for such a powerful core or any of the original craft is the vessel's core
[22410.23s -> 22415.75s]  no but what was apprentice to annona who created the original design and a black hole forge is
[22415.75s -> 22421.03s]  adept at crafting simpler cores i believe i can be of use here the vessel's warp core was created
[22421.03s -> 22429.66s]  before my time but unknown explained many of his designs to me but didn't we we got it right from
[22429.66s -> 22436.55s]  the horse's mouth already we talked to one of these people and i was like what are you doing
[22436.55s -> 22449.56s]  you just do okay why do you want to find the eye because we do i want to know why i need to know
[22449.72s -> 22456.20s]  why i can't wait to know why it's i'm gonna be told why and it's gonna be a huge like wow
[22456.20s -> 22468.02s]  i can't wait you've already they already told you yeah because they just wanted they just wanted
[22468.02s -> 22473.30s]  know as much as they possibly can they just they strive for knowledge right that's all it was
[22475.93s -> 22486.98s]  they're just curious you heard the term don't fly too close to the sun it seems like they did like
[22486.98s -> 22494.87s]  a hundred times this would require a return to dark bramble loom my father said many good know
[22494.87s -> 22501.72s]  my perished there retrieve the warp core from the vessel retrieve the warp core from dark bramble
[22505.82s -> 22510.22s]  my mentor and his old mentor once discovered and studied an anglerfish fossil on ember twin
[22511.18s -> 22520.46s]  i saw that once i studied an anglerfish fossil using that knowledge we could avoid the anglerfish
[22520.46s -> 22528.15s]  entirely i remember that anglerfish fossil we used to play in fossil fossil fish cave when we were
[22528.15s -> 22536.63s]  children that's that's fossil let's say that five times fast fossil fish cave fossil fish cave
[22540.62s -> 22544.14s]  what meloria and i have learned is that and that fossil would theoretically help us evade the
[22544.14s -> 22551.85s]  anglerfish but our hypothesis was never tested on a live specimen vessels warp core is broken
[22551.85s -> 22557.38s]  at best we call those present when the vessel crash said it was it's the same lethal injuries
[22557.38s -> 22562.89s]  there's no guaranteed reward for the risk perhaps we could still repair it my grandmother my
[22563.29s -> 22566.81s]  my grandmother told me there was a little time to assess the nature or extent of the damage
[22570.14s -> 22577.29s]  guys that's a liar even if it no longer functions the old core could be a valuable blueprint
[22577.29s -> 22595.93s]  provided we're able to transport it back here all right how often do i who cares let's keep going
[22595.93s -> 22609.82s]  up any more of those uh any more of those memory sticks for some reason you can't walk over that
[22614.34s -> 22618.90s]  i feel strange trying to recreate and known as warp core without him at times it still feels
[22618.90s -> 22625.59s]  strange to no longer be his very young apprentice for the black hole forge to be in my care and not
[22625.59s -> 22632.25s]  his this will always feel strange even though my time with him was short i miss my old mentor
[22632.97s -> 22642.94s]  the chance to try to have the chance to try is thrilling but i don't want to disappoint everyone
[22642.94s -> 22647.02s]  i think i can do this probably but what if excitement has clouded my assessment of my
[22647.02s -> 22653.40s]  own abilities was i wrong and volunteering to build it i was born in the star system and
[22653.40s -> 22660.34s]  never saw and known as warp core with my own three eyes i only know what he taught me they have three
[22660.34s -> 22669.02s]  eyes what if i've bitten off a larger portion than i can consume still all i can give is my best and
[22669.02s -> 22674.22s]  as anona would say should my best prove insufficient and we will find another way to achieve what's
[22674.22s -> 22695.13s]  needed i have clary and rude in the forge and i have my clan i'm not alone on the button to turn
[22695.13s -> 22726.31s]  on going up we are up very high mother fucker there's a distress beacon down there i'll have
[22726.31s -> 22739.66s]  to read that out later all right we made it to this kind of snowy area to go that way but wait is
[22739.66s -> 22770.34s]  there anything over here not really almost out of fuel which is not good running water all right
[22770.34s -> 22776.18s]  remember where this is this is right to the right south of the north pole and it's a little river
[22776.18s -> 22784.15s]  that you can go in all right cool a little shortcut um i'm gonna go back in here though
[22792.57s -> 22811.50s]  wait go all the way back down all right let me see let me find where's that distress beacon
[22812.79s -> 22816.41s]  down there there's more stuff i could do over here wasn't there
[22817.53s -> 22829.40s]  fortune controls uh yeah they go up and around up on like this surface let's go
[22830.28s -> 22834.17s]  there was like two other there were two or three other places to go
[22841.78s -> 22852.74s]  can i just go this way i guess i mean i i'd use the black hole thing
[22853.86s -> 22862.34s]  where's the black hole district isn't that just in it i'm going this way whatever i'm just gonna
[22862.34s -> 22882.87s]  explore uh i don't i don't seem to lead anywhere what does this go keep going not really what is
[22882.87s -> 22891.69s]  over here the sun's gonna blow up any second we have probably three minutes before the things
[22891.69s -> 22915.21s]  gonna start doing them on the music everybody is dead you're all dead everyone's dead everybody
[22915.21s -> 22945.02s]  did they supernova themselves oh yeah they commented themselves i get info to read yeah
[22945.02s -> 22950.81s]  some somebody uh somebody touched this thing that they weren't supposed to touch let's just see what
[22950.81s -> 22959.27s]  this is he welcomed in this place this shrine is a space to reflect on what brought us to the star
[22959.27s -> 22964.79s]  system to signal from the eye we observe the eye signal in our travels and followed it here to
[22964.79s -> 22970.57s]  find its source what we know is this the source of the signal which we have chosen to call the
[22970.57s -> 22979.45s]  eye of the universe is older than the universe itself the rest we have yet to learn enter and
[22979.45s -> 22991.62s]  open your mind to its possibilities what is the eye of the universe here we go it's gonna tell us
[22992.78s -> 22998.06s]  the eye is the source of the signal that brought us here suppose the eye is a more advanced being
[22998.78s -> 23004.86s]  pose the eye is older than this universe so imagine how much it could teach us perhaps it
[23004.86s -> 23018.66s]  is a cosmic library what is the eye's signal suppose the eye wishes to communicate the signal
[23018.66s -> 23023.78s]  is the eye's voice it speaks a language we don't yet know or maybe the signal is the eyes attempted
[23023.78s -> 23030.26s]  expressing itself the signal is a call where we the intended where were the intended audience
[23031.22s -> 23044.30s]  from the signal we were able to determine the eyes approximate age for lack of age and how can
[23044.30s -> 23049.64s]  the eye be older than the universe itself suppose it's a relic from a previous universe
[23050.60s -> 23055.16s]  the early universe was unimaginably hot and dense if anything existed before it would have been
[23055.16s -> 23071.56s]  destroyed suppose the universe is older than previously assumed okay uh universe old eye
[23071.56s -> 23108.89s]  knowledge good work guys what is this thing let's go up a little forward on something
[23112.06s -> 23117.42s]  what do you have to say i no longer believe as i did as a child on ember twin that the eye of the
[23117.42s -> 23128.15s]  universe wishes to harm us but it may not want to be found either what else do you have to say
[23128.71s -> 23132.55s]  the terrible circumstances of our arrival here were almost certainly exactly that circumstance
[23133.35s -> 23140.87s]  we saw her earlier i suspect imagining we are special to the eye in some ways wishful thinking
[23140.87s -> 23147.59s]  the eye might have called out to any sentient species or it might not have been calling out
[23147.59s -> 23155.58s]  at all and that my ancestors heard the eye's signal holds no great meaning this wouldn't be
[23155.58s -> 23161.08s]  so bad in fact the eye may not have wishes at all we have no evidence supporting this
[23161.64s -> 23174.76s]  it didn't call out to chat it didn't call out to you guys no sorry it wasn't calling to you
[23175.40s -> 23181.99s]  all right have we learned most of what we've learned so far have we learned everything we
[23181.99s -> 23211.62s]  need to know here hey asshole with the eye okay let's go back i think i've read most of the
[23211.62s -> 23217.70s]  things i can read here i missed please grab the ledge grab i'm going to the fucking black hole
[23218.26s -> 23221.30s]  i'm going to the black hole i'm going to the fucking black hole i tried to skip it i just
[23221.30s -> 23244.52s]  wanted to go so i wanted to go and get out and wait what the hell are you doing out here
[23245.48s -> 23258.94s]  wait what the hell are you doing out here this is a scripted part of the movie why are you doing
[23258.94s -> 23276.30s]  this hanging city the vessel oh the vessels warp core broke when the ship crashed in dark bramble
[23277.18s -> 23296.22s]  the vessel where we almost completed this one escape pod two warp core broke when the ship
[23296.30s -> 23305.85s]  crashed in dark bramble to dark bramble we go it sounds about to blow up but you know
[23306.73s -> 23335.58s]  these things things about to blow up i want to see the supernova it's gonna take too long no let's go
[23339.83s -> 23365.88s]  we did learn a lot but where i have to get into that ash twin database thing i have the key
[23367.00s -> 23370.52s]  i have the coordinates for the eye of the universe what am i what do i do with them
[23371.32s -> 23399.11s]  go to the vessel did just open up vessel no i debated how to obtain the powerful highly
[23399.11s -> 23403.83s]  advanced warp core when i traveled to the solar system in pursuit of a signal from something
[23403.83s -> 23413.93s]  older than the universe itself the vessel so we need to go to dark bramble and find this vessel
[23418.82s -> 23433.40s]  anglerfish no mine learned how to evade anglerfish by studying an anglerfish fossil they found on
[23433.40s -> 23460.94s]  ember twin let's go for it dark bramble it's been a while since i've been here actually
[23466.12s -> 23489.46s]  it's been it's been probably eight seven or eight in-game hours since i've been here dark
[23489.46s -> 23529.80s]  bramble and we're looking for a vessel a ship ship ship ship some kind of ship i'm gonna say
[23529.80s -> 23566.31s]  distress beacon yep yep yep there it is good impression of storage wars no that would that
[23566.31s -> 23616.02s]  would be a little different that would be yeah what the fuck is that it's a signal there it is
[23616.02s -> 23633.80s]  all right how do i get in there reliably right there there it is all right get in on the ship
[23634.36s -> 23662.97s]  all right fuck it let's get in there all right just get out i can swim right our escape pod
[23663.05s -> 23667.77s]  crashed as we tried to flee this place destroying our movement and communication capabilities in
[23667.77s -> 23673.46s]  the process we've held out as long as we could here but this pod supply of breathable air is
[23673.46s -> 23678.74s]  nearly depleted and the anglerfish attack more and more frequently the best chance at survival
[23678.74s -> 23686.89s]  is to return to the vessel to either repair the damage or more probably wait rescue second is
[23686.89s -> 23692.26s]  the message finished the vessel's beacon is already growing fainter it'll be gone in a matter of
[23692.26s -> 23703.26s]  hours we need to leave here isn't this is not the vessel all right escape pod three
[23713.29s -> 23719.19s]  this shit ain't the vessel well maybe i'll get some info where the hell it is
[23724.17s -> 23728.57s]  escape pod three vessel has been mortally injured emergency sequence activated awaiting departure
[23728.57s -> 23736.18s]  from vessel now launching escape pod three multiple collisions have altered pods trajectory
[23736.18s -> 23742.36s]  significant damage to pod detected navigation error life support error propulsion error
[23742.36s -> 23751.61s]  error scanning external environment scan complete gravity not detected breathable
[23751.61s -> 23759.66s]  air not detected multiple life forms detected do not exit pod i know what the vessel is the
[23759.66s -> 23775.22s]  vessel okay the vessel is the thing that explodes when you wake up there's a new problem our
[23775.22s -> 23781.93s]  equipment is detecting two distinct beacons from the vessel but it's impossible for the vessel to
[23781.93s -> 23788.58s]  be in two different locations at the same time i agree but the beacons are exactly identical to
[23788.58s -> 23793.54s]  each other perhaps if i had more time we're nearly out of time already din the vessel's
[23793.54s -> 23799.34s]  beacon is quickly fading soon will be gone and we'll be lost we will follow the beacon whose
[23799.34s -> 23805.61s]  source is nearest to us suppose that beacon is false we likely don't have enough air to reach
[23805.61s -> 23811.46s]  the farther of the two beacons did the decision is made for us we'll leave a trail of lights as
[23811.46s -> 23821.51s]  we go there's still a chance someone could hear our escape pods distress signal okay don't open
[23821.51s -> 23838.10s]  this yet i want to read this emergency escape hatch wait no we gotta go we gotta follow these
[23838.10s -> 23863.69s]  lights give me the ship give me in the ship okay all the lights going that way i'm just
[23863.69s -> 23882.22s]  into the computer escape pod three escape pod three survivors another beacon didn't say there
[23882.22s -> 23909.61s]  was another beacon that's what is this is this a ship holy fuck they're all dead okay hold on
[23910.41s -> 23930.38s]  what are they what are they doing over here ready who come here searching for us we followed one of
[23930.38s -> 23938.20s]  the two beacons from the vessel to this place but now can go no further it's almost too faint to
[23938.20s -> 23944.52s]  hear now but the vessel's beacon is still faintly emitting from within this thorny seed yet the
[23944.52s -> 23948.76s]  opening is too small for even a single gnomai to fit through it so our escape pod couldn't have
[23948.76s -> 23956.71s]  flown through here i don't understand how this could be possible but this gruesome place seems
[23956.71s -> 23963.18s]  able to manipulate space itself maybe this was our undoing so to be close to the location of the
[23963.18s -> 23970.46s]  vessel and still go so far is difficult worse the vessel's beacon is dying soon we'll be unable to
[23970.46s -> 23975.46s]  hear it there's nothing we can do now but try to perhaps find a way inside or at least attempt to
[23975.46s -> 23981.30s]  comprehend why this happened my dearest hope is that the other escape pods were able to reach
[23981.30s -> 24000.58s]  relative sits the fucking thing that's on the home planet that's the thing that's on the home
[24000.58s -> 24008.36s]  planet the vessel is the thing on the home planet box box thanks for the raid just i missed it sorry
[24008.92s -> 24014.30s]  thank you box box for the huge raid welcome everybody we're currently in the second half of
[24015.69s -> 24020.66s]  uh i almost said keep talking and nobody explodes but that's kind of that makes that's
[24021.22s -> 24034.14s]  you could describe this as well i would do wilds okay here we go i know what to do let's do it
[24034.70s -> 24041.40s]  hey stop the way of ruin my immersion
[24044.28s -> 24067.42s]  hold on do it again that's where it is he's gonna follow the thing all right we don't need
[24067.42s -> 24079.03s]  anything else here go back in the ship let's get the hell out here follow that beacon follow that
[24079.03s -> 24159.40s]  beacon right red duplicate signal it's in the red oh hi guys okay go go go faster
[24161.67s -> 24192.02s]  will he smash his head on something uh so two of them show up i'm not sure uh we have to get by
[24192.02s -> 24212.17s]  them is there a way i can kill them or something i learned a lot fossils they turn into fossils but
[24212.17s -> 24233.13s]  how okay my grave survivors from escape pod three follow one of the two vessel beacons to a small
[24233.13s -> 24238.57s]  dark bramble seed but they could go no further they could hear the vessels beacon from i'm sorry
[24239.37s -> 24270.23s]  stupid fucking mike the opening was too small yeah yeah yeah studying an angler fish fossil
[24270.23s -> 24289.61s]  they found on ember twin shit ah i gotta go to the ember twin thing to find out how to evade them
[24291.05s -> 24316.09s]  is it like just is it light is an angler fish fossil on ember twin go to ember twin and find it
[24316.73s -> 24353.93s]  ember twin let's go there's a fossil of one of these on ember twin hopefully it's on the surface
[24354.73s -> 24380.26s]  but didn't i know i've seen it it's in that cave how do i get in that cave i never found out a guy
[24380.26s -> 24406.10s]  is it was way to like drop down is way to drop i think i can drop somewhere i just don't remember
[24406.10s -> 24412.70s]  i know it's in that like that cave system i gotta go down there and look but i can't get there from
[24412.70s -> 24454.34s]  there it's over here above the door where the cannon is here it is all right so theoretically
[24454.34s -> 24469.98s]  here get out of this thing here right no no no no where is it it's like in the rocks up here
[24470.94s -> 24478.86s]  why does it have to be so fucking dark why is it to be so dark unbelievable this is a space game
[24480.38s -> 24498.28s]  okay this is where it is not here what the fuck excuse me i was holding a
[24499.24s -> 24518.82s]  okay now how do i get there from here it's gotta be away wait i i didn't even touch this shit
[24519.62s -> 24558.22s]  i didn't even touch this stuff did i angler fish oh huh angler fish observation tarot deck
[24559.80s -> 24568.34s]  yeah how does this no wait very old specimen what we might learn if we could examine it
[24569.06s -> 24572.50s]  for both grades and luckily this dry plant is hard yeah i don't know i've already looked in here
[24575.93s -> 24579.61s]  i need to get like in i want to get in the observation deck i want to get in the room
[24580.17s -> 24592.07s]  i need to get inside of there clearly this hole is too small for it to have fit through
[24592.07s -> 24596.15s]  there's another entrance to this cave if there is coleus and i will find it we can't leave valley
[24596.15s -> 24601.06s]  below of course there is okay now why can there never be just a front door in this game
[24602.55s -> 24609.08s]  every door is blocked you have to go in a back cave door we need to find a way inside quickly
[24609.64s -> 24613.08s]  because when i returned here there was uh children playing in the specimen
[24614.04s -> 24639.00s]  there's another way in whatever gotta go here comes sand that was too fast
[24640.92s -> 24650.22s]  what's this one stepping stone district there's so much shit here turn them all on
[24650.22s -> 24664.26s]  um high energy lab trailhead what's this one eye shrine district over there let's do one
[24664.26s -> 24673.34s]  at a time here can you give me like a three second window before it becomes available to touch again
[24686.78s -> 24691.14s]  running out of time
[24699.90s -> 24705.62s]  we're meeting in the fossil fish cave to play the game if you're too big to climb through the
[24705.62s -> 24713.53s]  angler fish overlook hole you'll have to go the long way but it isn't far go to the stepping
[24713.53s -> 24722.54s]  stone cave and then up and into the fossil fish cave i tried to get to the fossil fish through the
[24722.54s -> 24729.72s]  stepping stone cave but i couldn't find the entrance where is it remember to feed the fossil
[24729.72s -> 24734.60s]  fish first if you go to the angler fish overlook and throw a light into his mouth he'll show you
[24734.60s -> 24739.69s]  the way what rocket can't fit through the angler fish overlook hole anymore because they grew
[24739.69s -> 24749.78s]  bigger he's taller than levi now who cares it's still i'm still the tallest i'm gonna do one final
[24749.78s -> 24756.04s]  break i'm gonna take auto out and pee and we'll do our last break and hopefully i can get this
[24756.04s -> 25037.62s]  game done in the next hour or so i'll be right back what are you guys fighting why are you guys
[25037.62s -> 25057.27s]  fighting why is everybody fighting hey no food fights no food fights please all right stepping
[25057.27s -> 25074.52s]  stone cave the entrance is feed the fossil fish from light into his mouth stepping stone cave
[25079.37s -> 25094.70s]  okay well the sand is filling up i gotta gotta what is this stepping stone cave i keep having
[25094.70s -> 25104.98s]  these eureka reveal moments in my brain and i say them as i see them although i didn't put the light
[25104.98s -> 25123.05s]  down wait did i shit is it still there all right thank god thank god my my idiot brain actually
[25123.05s -> 25160.62s]  just left it there oh children doing this why were children doing this sand sand am i supposed
[25160.62s -> 25173.51s]  to use the sand how much higher can i go that's not correct that's not correct it's not correct
[25173.51s -> 25212.74s]  it's okay it's just sand how do i get up here the fuck do i just i mean the light he has the
[25212.74s -> 25224.78s]  light going your way the stairs i just was on the stairs all this wasn't i just on them oh i was
[25224.78s -> 25240.12s]  following the scout thing over there i only have three minutes of air what the hell is all this
[25241.00s -> 25246.12s]  are we playing the fossil fish game tonight i fed the fossil fish a new lantern if you go to the
[25246.12s -> 25252.15s]  stepping stone cave the entrance to the fossil fish cave is easy to see now gratitude solenum
[25253.16s -> 25257.40s]  good to see you're small enough to climb in through the hole at the angler fish overlook
[25258.36s -> 25264.46s]  i'm still small enough you won't be for long mom and dad are tall so you and i will be tall too
[25266.87s -> 25297.43s]  must be nice uh i just keep going keep going all the stairs no this is not right that's not right
[25298.78s -> 25312.41s]  stepping stone cave i was i think it's over uh all right it's we're like filled up we're like
[25312.41s -> 25321.51s]  filled up with sand at this point do i have time to do it do i actually have time to do it
[25322.63s -> 25328.31s]  i have time okay well what is it up here i don't remember the doors every single door here is it's
[25328.31s -> 25332.71s]  all the same it's blending together in my brain it's all the same architecture where's it's right
[25332.71s -> 25349.80s]  there i i this is broken there it's in here it's not i don't have any oxygen either i'm dead how
[25349.80s -> 25376.52s]  to die yeah well now i'm gonna go here exactly immediately did i just better get it no uh i'm
[25376.52s -> 25388.12s]  gonna do this i'm just so disoriented down here the cave is just like the same color on either
[25388.12s -> 25393.24s]  side and this like it's just everything melts together in the same pot of same exact image in
[25393.24s -> 25400.25s]  my brain i have this one light in the middle and like the same color on either side of my brain
[25401.21s -> 25419.42s]  right there oh quickly quickly learn the secret learn the secret quickly whoever was
[25419.42s -> 25424.78s]  whoever was it when we ended last time is the anglerfish pickle rule change the anglerfish
[25424.78s -> 25434.01s]  now has to wear a blindfold the rest of us line up against one wall when the anglerfish says go
[25434.01s -> 25441.53s]  the little fish sneak across to the other side the anglerfish catches you you're eaten last little
[25441.61s -> 25446.52s]  fish to be caught is the new anglerfish the old anglerfish gives the new anglerfish the blindfold
[25446.52s -> 25451.59s]  and becomes a little fish why are we changing it it's too hard if you can't see anything
[25453.08s -> 25458.76s]  aunt pie says real anglerfish are blind but you have to wear a blindfold the rule stands
[25460.12s -> 25463.19s]  it's okay if younger kids don't wear the blindfold when they're at it
[25463.83s -> 25467.34s]  the rest of us will still wear it for scientific accuracy and make the game even
[25468.30s -> 25484.58s]  all right so the blind so that what just to go quietly is there anything while i'm still frozen
[25484.58s -> 25490.26s]  here is it any those kids dead holy shit okay what about what's up something up here
[25496.06s -> 25511.99s]  i made it what oh come on really okay i got i learned what i wanted to learn anglerfish are
[25511.99s -> 25518.26s]  blind so i'm assuming i just have to be very quiet when they show up
[25518.26s -> 25543.62s]  so we'll just just turn off the engine just don't move like if they're blind then they
[25543.62s -> 25548.66s]  can hear so they they're gonna i just have to just not move don't make any sounds when
[25548.66s -> 25569.27s]  they're around okay so let's test that hypothesis and let's head back to the bramble to that ship
[25569.99s -> 25579.16s]  for that uh beacon see if we can kind of coast slowly by them
[25579.16s -> 25626.47s]  um okay go in the sun if i keep this trajectory all right take up the stress beacon escape pod
[25626.47s -> 25635.58s]  three and we go that correct all right this should be i'm gonna be quiet is there any is
[25635.58s -> 25639.74s]  how do i be quiet in this thing it's like a big ship with fire and um how do i be quiet
[25640.38s -> 25662.62s]  i wonder if i just if i just don't move but then how do i kind of turn the ship
[25663.58s -> 25670.76s]  it's at the i wonder what's the range of them being able to see or hear me
[25671.96s -> 25705.59s]  okay uh is it just the red one should i just go towards the red one that's just it right
[25706.55s -> 25740.46s]  i don't have to do this whole thing all over again do i all right somebody's hears me i'm just i'm
[25740.46s -> 25750.06s]  not moving where's he go to the left okay he's right next to me is there one right next to me
[25750.06s -> 25756.10s]  to the right all right there he is can i move oh my god i don't know what i don't know the timing
[25758.62s -> 25782.60s]  he was still i thought he was past me the booster is low enough for one bar they won't hear you
[25783.56s -> 25794.04s]  can i look around hold on let me i could like get out hold on this took me like five or six
[25794.04s -> 25825.69s]  five tries i believe i don't know i'm trying to figure it out this is where i gave up
[25825.69s -> 25852.41s]  oh really damn i feel like i want to go fast though like tiptoeing around okay that one
[25853.29s -> 25858.49s]  when you go in the red dot and there's two of them and they go hey don't move there right but i feel
[25858.49s -> 25866.94s]  i feel like if i the slower i am like i'd rather just go in quicker and and i'm looking at chat and
[25866.94s -> 25870.06s]  talking and i'm gonna crash into this and we're gonna have to do the whole fucking thing over again
[25870.78s -> 25899.24s]  a philosophy joke let's be supportive for a change germa you got this don't fuck it up
[25900.04s -> 25907.34s]  it's not really supportive that's more like putting pressure on me you should have said hey you got
[25907.34s -> 25957.14s]  this no not don't fuck it up i wonder where it is i'm just gonna go fast the faster i went last time
[25957.14s -> 25977.54s]  i got through two like just go the last two times i've made it through here i've gone fast is there
[25977.54s -> 25986.15s]  a way to how do i look do i have to unbuckle see like i'm just i just got the fuck in here
[25993.03s -> 26001.99s]  and now is when i just don't fucking move um but wait wait wait wait wait hold on a second
[26002.87s -> 26020.33s]  so how do i i'm gonna bump into his his tendril i'm gonna touch him i'm gonna touch him you can
[26020.33s -> 26029.03s]  direct it wait i have to go don't boost i can move i'm gonna touch him i'm gonna touch him
[26029.67s -> 26065.96s]  oh how did i not touch him i i'm shocked and i can't believe i didn't touch him
[26067.56s -> 26097.67s]  okay almost there floor it i'm not gonna floor it wait okay what is it is it another thing to go in
[26097.67s -> 26110.23s]  is another bramble or is it a vessel is it the vessel i can't see what that is what is that
[26110.79s -> 26131.13s]  it just flew by me what is this i'm not gonna floor it i'm not gonna floor it no flooring it
[26131.77s -> 26143.64s]  there's a bunch of eggs am i the sperm i'm the sperm i knew it this is about making a baby the
[26143.64s -> 26163.90s]  baby's eyes are gonna open it's gonna be a baby okay so what is this what am i doing with this
[26164.78s -> 26226.86s]  am i gonna crash into this what is this eggs what i did i did i pass something hold on do i have a
[26226.86s -> 26272.79s]  beacon i can't break them he didn't scout the vessel pick a hole and go omega lull
[26273.67s -> 26306.92s]  you see people saying i missed a person here i don't see anything that's really weird whatever
[26306.92s -> 26319.05s]  it is like a dna strand so where the vessel is go find that all right it's gonna pick a hole
[26323.14s -> 26333.69s]  wait what are you talking about what are you guys talking about i don't have the scout anywhere
[26334.25s -> 26344.54s]  guys i shot the scout at that i i that that's not i shot the scout onto this
[26345.75s -> 26352.22s]  that's i didn't do the thing i did before the scout i didn't have the scout i didn't do the
[26352.22s -> 26359.16s]  thing i didn't go back and shoot it through the thing you did a hole now just one of these
[26359.16s -> 26369.02s]  fucking things just shoot it into one of these i think i think it has hit i think i just hit
[26369.02s -> 26380.70s]  i think i just hit a fish well wake up if you want to wake already what about right here
[26381.34s -> 26421.24s]  not on that one it's not that one so what i had to have gone back to where they all were dead and
[26421.24s -> 26436.90s]  shot it in there to be able to find where the vessel is i can still find it i mean good luck
[26436.90s -> 26461.02s]  i have to just pick the random one that's correct i'm gonna hit this damn it so so this was so this
[26461.02s -> 26477.03s]  was the fake signal right then they said there was two signals i think i just have to die then
[26477.03s -> 26482.92s]  don't i i have to just like floor it and just die because i don't know i have no idea which
[26482.92s -> 26492.10s]  one's the right one just like this like it doesn't mean he's not there let's have to leave
[26494.90s -> 26501.21s]  there's no distress beacon in here i'm just gonna go in one
[26501.93s -> 26515.78s]  whatever i don't have the the signal like i have to go get the signal and shoot it into the thing
[26515.78s -> 26533.66s]  so i know where it is i might be screwed here yeah i should have done that first i just for some
[26533.66s -> 26538.38s]  reason i thought because i don't know i thought i listened to one guy in chat that said just fly
[26538.38s -> 26557.00s]  to the red light you're fine you can't even get me somebody said you don't have to do that just
[26557.00s -> 26585.62s]  fly to the red light and i was like oh okay you must know what you're talking about all right go
[26585.62s -> 26605.53s]  to escape pod three shoot into the thing go follow the beacon follow the scout that's where i need to
[26605.53s -> 26657.74s]  go now it's time for hard mode no let's go go to the grave fire the thing in sneak past all the
[26657.74s -> 26665.45s]  guards and follow the right beacon should have done that i was gonna do that too i was going to
[26666.09s -> 26688.09s]  i'm actually glad it's an emote only but i can't get fake advice i wonder what seriously the
[26688.09s -> 26697.26s]  percentage of actual real advice is in twitch chats or if people are just saying just typing
[26697.26s -> 26700.54s]  random shit they're just like i don't fucking tell them i'm just gonna see if i can get them to do
[26700.54s -> 26712.86s]  this hey yeah dude uh you you press a three times when you get to the when you get to the grave is
[26712.86s -> 26719.85s]  he gonna do that and they hear they hear this and they're like oh my god what a fucking idiot
[26719.85s -> 26730.66s]  let's go fast i know everyone hates this and so do i but i have to go fast i have to
[26731.30s -> 26778.33s]  grave i thought that was a fish it's just a log it's just a strange looking log okay here we go
[26792.31s -> 26814.07s]  is that a fish or is that a log okay here we go there it is hire the scout in and then follow
[26814.07s -> 26852.97s]  the lights god you're gonna make me fucking throw up what are you it won't go in it won't this shit
[26852.97s -> 26920.20s]  won't follow the lights i did wait no i just have to go to the no i already have it it's already
[26920.20s -> 26924.92s]  there why why did they say all the lights oh no that was we did that already okay yeah i got
[26924.92s -> 26942.14s]  the yeah yeah that was like that i did it in reverse duplicate signal let's go here we go
[26942.14s -> 26946.78s]  just get me in get out of this okay can we get like the star trek ship to get the fuck out of
[26946.78s -> 26967.02s]  my way it's not that way it's down there i'm gonna bump this right have we that's be very
[26967.02s -> 26984.62s]  clear that i'm not gonna bump this shit all right there's the scout wait where's the error duplicate
[26984.62s -> 27023.98s]  scout is that is this still good we're good right i'm going so slow but i can't press a button
[27031.61s -> 27035.69s]  there are the frog eggs there are all the new tadpoles that are going to come out that's fine
[27035.69s -> 27062.22s]  we just go past it is it safe to use thrusters right now is it safe to use thrusters
[27063.26s -> 27083.69s]  no i can hear somebody i just did it a little bit okay don't do it anymore
[27088.70s -> 27093.91s]  oh sorry just floor it try floor it try floor it
[27104.94s -> 27134.81s]  oh all right so we've got 600 meters we're almost there this is the vessel are those things still
[27134.81s -> 27167.53s]  here what do i do get out and fly in it with my body is there a broken entrance or something
[27173.50s -> 27185.74s]  their window broken like over here okay get in here entrance over here this looks like torn up
[27185.74s -> 27206.94s]  can i go in there underneath because the door this is just like a underneath and underneath dude
[27207.58s -> 27220.41s]  what kind of fucked up ship do you fly here what is this fucking thing this this is a lawnmower
[27220.41s -> 27233.48s]  this is not even a ship where how do i get in here you're fucking weed whack a ship i well how
[27233.48s -> 27264.26s]  where do i go take it off emote only give me the answer i don't care get out of this thing before
[27264.26s -> 27292.65s]  it explodes no what at the very top my god this is so disorienting i want to throw up
[27298.97s -> 27318.55s]  right here this gameplay makes me want to puke in fact i probably should go puke wait it's not
[27318.55s -> 27355.72s]  right here there's a giant hole right here oh you dickhead game it was this the whole time this is
[27355.72s -> 27363.37s]  no entrance here this is nothing here to go in oh you gotta be fucking kidding me it's that
[27363.37s -> 27384.41s]  white ass background i was gonna go there first but i was like oh no there's like there's nothing
[27384.41s -> 27413.74s]  there all right what do you got in here what can i read in here turn this on power it up this thing
[27414.46s -> 27438.31s]  all right we're gonna put power somewhere i don't know what that did i guess i don't know i'm gonna
[27438.31s -> 27446.36s]  go travel up here although there's a button to press over there but i'm not gonna press it yet
[27446.36s -> 27458.01s]  it's probably info up here there is why can i just chew on fucking like gravity gum like they do in
[27458.01s -> 27464.33s]  mars attacks this is escal's vessel something went badly wrong during our warp and our vessel
[27464.33s -> 27471.46s]  is mortally wounded we needed help as quickly as possible our vessel appears to have has it
[27471.46s -> 27477.83s]  fused with the local environment somehow there are vines that are now part of the vessel it's
[27477.83s -> 27484.39s]  been torn apart from the inside itself we're abandoning our vessel any nomai clans or space
[27484.39s -> 27488.71s]  flight capable species receiving this message i employ you we need your help well you're all
[27488.71s -> 27495.43s]  dead is this broken can anyone hear me hello our vessel's dying sorry i only have 20 minutes to
[27495.43s -> 27523.02s]  figure this out any nomai clans is best i can hear this message clear the universe is dying
[27523.02s -> 27527.74s]  there are fewer and fewer resources and safe places within space now so my clan and i believe
[27527.74s -> 27535.08s]  the best option is for all our clans to stay together if you can reach the glooming galaxy
[27535.96s -> 27542.36s]  we found that black rocks suns are fairly stable and life in this star system is thriving we live
[27542.36s -> 27550.86s]  in relative safety well if you prefer you to continue exploring alone know you will be on
[27550.86s -> 27558.58s]  your own hannah we're making our way to you there's a lot of writing on this one they took
[27558.58s -> 27563.94s]  the whole board it's good to hear from you romey we'll watch your vessel we'll watch for your
[27563.94s -> 27571.06s]  vessel has anyone heard from neem his clan was on its way to our vessel but they never arrived and
[27571.06s -> 27577.96s]  he hasn't sent any messages i'm beginning to worry that is unsettling it reminds me of that old myth
[27577.96s -> 27587.00s]  my grandfather used to tell the disappearance of escal remember hearing that story as a child
[27587.96s -> 27592.12s]  one day escal's vessel simply stopped responding the other clan searched and searched but found
[27592.12s -> 27598.34s]  no trace it was as if their missing friends had warped out of existence that's no myth friends
[27598.34s -> 27604.82s]  escal's clan existed and their story was real what a curious event to have passed into myth our
[27604.82s -> 27609.38s]  ancestors ancestors were told that story when they were young are you sure it's true
[27615.77s -> 27622.09s]  fucking goddamn gravity man i swear to god it was a very long time ago but yes my clan's ancestors
[27622.09s -> 27635.27s]  searched for escal's clan for a long time but in the end none of them were none of them were ever
[27635.27s -> 27647.03s]  seen again i hope you aren't comparing escal's story to my clan's vessel all right wrap it off
[27647.03s -> 27656.58s]  guys it got much more board space time to wrap it up neem my friend we feared you were gone
[27657.30s -> 27662.47s]  people gonna start writing on the edge like a little bit like oh fuck i can't fit it
[27664.94s -> 27669.50s]  not yet we aren't but nearly we found trouble during our warp see blame this idiot
[27669.82s -> 27674.95s]  that took this much space right like two or three people took up way too much space here
[27678.02s -> 27682.42s]  we found trouble during our warp the triple suns of the bright spark star system exploded
[27682.42s -> 27690.31s]  and it was only a lucky coincidence we weren't caught in the blast we'll meet you soon
[27690.31s -> 27696.34s]  i'm relieved your clan is safe neem it's good to hear your words any vessels nearby remember
[27696.34s -> 27703.26s]  to be extremely cautious of potentially unstable stars because yeah blame the guy with the big
[27703.26s -> 27744.63s]  bald ass handwriting you didn't have to have a board this big i press the button warp core
[27744.63s -> 27792.04s]  uh i don't think this thing's broken what the hell is this i have to turn on all the the karen
[27792.04s -> 27797.80s]  stones i know the word i know the word i know the word i know the word i know the word i know the
[27797.80s -> 27806.98s]  word i know the word i know the word i have to spell out the coordinates okay it's it's like an l
[27806.98s -> 27857.32s]  right just stop moving like this it's like a weird l sit still i'm holding a this is definitely how
[27857.32s -> 27865.24s]  you spell out those coordinates it's gonna be really hard to do um i don't i don't know what
[27865.24s -> 27874.12s]  they are it's like c yeah i don't i don't know exactly what it looks like warp core is broken
[27874.12s -> 27880.34s]  well is this a warp am i am i warping right now i don't even i probably know this could be the
[27880.34s -> 27898.87s]  fucking microwave i don't have that info i'm not gonna be able to do this regardless but this is
[27898.87s -> 27916.46s]  i get this is where i have to put that in yes the three it's three one two okay i mean can i
[27916.46s -> 27922.18s]  can i place it in here is that like what i'm supposed to do yeah i'm dead anyways all right
[27922.18s -> 27929.61s]  well i found it is there anything else i can see before i die warp core has to go here i don't have
[27929.61s -> 27943.05s]  a warp core i have a broken warp core can i take my ship's warp core do i have a warp core
[27943.85s -> 27951.22s]  oh time's up anyways is there anything else like over here i just dead person there
[27951.94s -> 27980.23s]  i'm going down the hallways i'm all closed goodbye just die i have zero health zero h02 whatever
[27981.11s -> 27986.23s]  okay so i found the vessel there's a broken warp core and that's where you input the coordinates
[27987.27s -> 28018.82s]  i need a warp core i have to go back there with a warp core see what i learned he's definitely not
[28018.82s -> 28030.70s]  gonna finish this tonight really is that much more to do i have the core i just really no way
[28033.58s -> 28053.85s]  you're really close no way though oh here we go there's the vessel activated reset
[28053.85s -> 28056.73s]  pillar on the vessel's bridge there appears to be some sort of input device
[28058.09s -> 28061.37s]  they tried to call for help but the vessel's outgoing message did you know there's a problem
[28061.37s -> 28065.93s]  there the vessel can still hear incoming messages from other nomi vessels the remaining nomi
[28065.93s -> 28083.19s]  clans are regrouping in response to the impending death of the universe right how am i still not
[28083.19s -> 28102.41s]  done black hole forge found a switch in the meldwater district that raises and lowers the
[28102.41s -> 28105.29s]  forge the black hole forge district is the highest district in the hanging city
[28106.25s -> 28112.41s]  no my name poke plan to create a new advanced warp core in the black hole forge no my crafted
[28112.41s -> 28117.53s]  warp cores of black hole forge before delivering them to ash twin that's where we're gonna get one
[28124.78s -> 28139.48s]  all right let's mark it i need where is it it's the brittle brittle bramble whatever it's called
[28145.29s -> 28154.50s]  shard uh black hole forge all right can i um i mark this spend it below the hand i
[28154.50s -> 28167.40s]  had to go to the hanging city i guess i can mark the hanging city let's go have i been to the
[28167.40s -> 28176.71s]  sixth location yes i did that a very very long time ago i did that a long long time like four
[28176.71s -> 28187.24s]  or five hours ago yeah remember that shortcut to the hanging city you know what yep where is it
[28187.24s -> 28193.13s]  i don't remember just tell me i'm your friend you can tell me these things just tell me i'm
[28193.13s -> 28201.64s]  your friend i'm your friend near the north pole we're friends here and it was the river water
[28201.64s -> 28219.94s]  right you and i you and i friend you can tell me where that shortcut north pole river you never
[28219.94s -> 28226.38s]  been to any of my birthday parties yes i have i was in a costume i didn't want to give away my
[28226.38s -> 28244.07s]  identity so i was i came in a costume all right we need the north pole uh it's like the place
[28244.07s -> 28257.02s]  so there's a river flowing through it where is it over here where's that river right here somewhere
[28257.02s -> 28274.86s]  i think let's get out this is the south pole opposite side um oh you were the stripper
[28275.74s -> 28281.50s]  so you ordering a costumed stripper how does that make any sense
[28297.72s -> 28299.86s]  close enough
[28309.43s -> 28321.74s]  okay it's like right here right there's water right here somewhere
[28330.25s -> 28348.44s]  there's that water there it is okay let's go back down let's go to the that city i think
[28348.44s -> 28360.98s]  i just blew up right behind me is that hole
[28360.98s -> 28371.50s]  where the hell is it is it on the it's not on the other side is it the whole other side completely
[28373.82s -> 28396.90s]  isn't a lot of fuel for this shit too okay all right now we need to go to the forge which is
[28401.83s -> 28418.66s]  actually sure to be honest it's up isn't it city the top most level i already read all this
[28429.99s -> 28439.91s]  is there an elevator or something i can fly i can get on over here all the way up there
[28439.91s -> 28455.40s]  can i get up there i gotta do the controls first oh wait yeah those are down here aren't there
[28456.84s -> 28482.18s]  all right press the button there it goes i get on that while moving i'm not gonna use any more
[28482.18s -> 28490.92s]  fuel so now i have to go up up here up up up all the way up can i let me try this one first
[28491.72s -> 28501.58s]  this way maybe i go all the way up up up up up that's as far as i can go
[28502.38s -> 28530.10s]  i'll be even further from here to there another way to get here this way yes this looks right
[28530.10s -> 28531.06s]  this looks kind of correct
[28535.83s -> 28586.57s]  you'll know how do i it is wrong but oh there's what is that thing
[28587.53s -> 28604.04s]  that's a teleporter isn't it where was there a teleporter
[28606.41s -> 28617.75s]  wait i think maybe i can jump and look at it where was the teleporter that goes to here
[28618.47s -> 28633.51s]  it's this white and purple looking place is it over here there's a thing here
[28634.63s -> 28645.29s]  what the hell is a teleporter is it on a different planet there's a couple of teleporters
[28646.01s -> 28669.61s]  do i actually have to go and teleport from a different planet to here why can't i just fly
[28670.81s -> 28695.51s]  hey uh i've been streaming for too long for this what is that what is up here there's something
[28695.51s -> 28717.96s]  else i did everything here where have i seen that cube before i remember standing on it and
[28717.96s -> 28729.11s]  and where is it where is it where is it where is it where is it i'm searching my brain right
[28729.11s -> 28737.21s]  now where is that platform i have to look at brittle ramble when it comes by where is it
[28738.17s -> 28761.46s]  ash twin we're gonna go to ash
[28774.63s -> 28801.14s]  are you going to ash twin yeah that's true how is this not exploded i was trying to just delete
[28801.14s -> 28809.67s]  this and do it again and sleep in a campfire why are you still here explode already
[28814.82s -> 28825.37s]  explode thank you what just get out and repair it
[28831.88s -> 28842.28s]  no no i'm starting over i'm starting over again i think i'm stuck what do you mean isn't it where's
[28842.28s -> 28868.15s]  the eject button there's no eject button i'm almost out now if this thing is stuck back here
[28868.15s -> 28894.54s]  i'm gonna burn myself to death in the fire i don't know i don't know what the campfire is
[28895.26s -> 28918.41s]  i have no idea this will kill me don't worry why is it so hard to die i'm trying to die
[28919.21s -> 28959.96s]  what's in there here comes kazoo ending too all right how long what like a minute two minutes
[28960.52s -> 28969.46s]  how long is too long for me to get to the planet one minute two minutes probably two
[28969.94s -> 29014.68s]  i'm gonna say like two i'm gonna take about three minutes or so to get there okay we are going to
[29017.46s -> 29026.15s]  ash twin we're going to desperately try to find the teleporter to that place teleport to it
[29049.69s -> 29056.97s]  he didn't do the black hole forge thing i'm not i'm gonna be out of time then like i shouldn't
[29056.97s -> 29070.15s]  have slept in the fucking campfire then why did i sleep at the campfire let me just see if this
[29070.15s -> 29108.95s]  works i'm gonna go into the sun i just need a warp core and i can end the what do you
[29110.39s -> 29120.20s]  that almost seems impossible that was that was impossible what just happened i have no idea what
[29120.20s -> 29143.05s]  i don't know use autopilot autopilot flies you into the sun it just puts you in a straight line
[29143.05s -> 29157.48s]  to wherever you're going and just goes straight into the sun all right i'm gonna how fast can i
[29157.48s -> 29189.91s]  do this north pole do the controls teleport these are the real gaming hours
[29190.55s -> 29222.57s]  why is the atmosphere yet sir am i allowed to turn sir this is a wendy's
[29236.63s -> 29243.72s]  so we need to be in north pole i don't is this the north pole it's not we need the north pole
[29243.72s -> 29278.86s]  so here it is this side of the other side it's the other side it's the other side
[29279.82s -> 29294.25s]  side other side is it right there is it right there it's right there that's right okay
[29294.97s -> 29305.58s]  turn on the controls and then come back up here all right so how how do i reliably get back up here
[29306.14s -> 29324.44s]  just go back up that way how hard is it this way this way this way okay then down here
[29324.44s -> 29337.30s]  all right right here turn this shit on going up right okay controls are on let's get back up here
[29340.84s -> 29381.06s]  back up right let's go now we head to the ash quinn find that teleporter stand on
[29381.06s -> 29403.66s]  one let's go move let's go all right it's on the equator but which one it's on the equator it's
[29403.66s -> 29438.04s]  one of those towers on the equator just gotta find the one that has the at white background
[29438.04s -> 29447.40s]  so this is i'm on the this is the equator here i don't see any towers yet don't get hit by the
[29449.22s -> 29469.86s]  thing here all right this one here is it this one here it's here somewhere
[29471.54s -> 29484.62s]  oh looks like a sun all right not this one what about another one what about this
[29484.62s -> 29528.36s]  way what's this one what's this one's shape like does it even have one in it wait this is the
[29529.32s -> 29539.88s]  it's not this one it's not this one it's not this one this is the um this is this plan wait no this
[29539.88s -> 29567.52s]  this is this planet right cuz this is the two pillars let me see now this ain't it
[29567.52s -> 29582.82s]  watch the ground you're gonna see the ground it's not white wrong it needs to be white
[29582.82s -> 29606.40s]  another one okay here it looks like it's coming for me sun shaped tower that's this tower
[29606.40s -> 29629.20s]  then there's this five towers right what's this one that shape like a circle might be
[29629.20s -> 29651.84s]  this one they all teleport to a different place arm of three well there's oxygen here
[29651.84s -> 29671.71s]  thank god there's don't get too cocky here was the last one it's here there should be
[29671.71s -> 29679.28s]  two more one here wait just wait for this to go by so I can have but I can uninterrupt
[29679.52s -> 29708.01s]  yeah here's another one this is another tower hey what's this one this one is this is just a
[29708.01s -> 29723.79s]  spot but wait a minute that's uh this is we need the sand to go down this is not brutal hollow
[29723.79s -> 29745.13s]  though this is like the spike shit it's got to be this one it has to be this one is the sun again
[29745.13s -> 29772.80s]  now this is the Sun I did a full circle were there only four towers did I miss one
[29772.80s -> 29791.34s]  now the sands come in here isn't it I'll drop it that fucking sand
[29814.97s -> 29846.62s]  all right let's go okay brutal hollow wasn't it that's not brutal hollow
[29847.58s -> 29869.80s]  oh here's our first delivery one warp core fresh and black hole core
[29871.00s -> 29920.30s]  sands going up I'm upside down right all right this is it I gotta wait for I gotta wait brutal
[29920.30s -> 29957.21s]  hollow has to be in view hey look at what happened departure time 800 time arrival 800 with a little
[29957.21s -> 29970.83s]  one return warp status charged step onto warp platform when ready black hole forge
[29971.96s -> 29996.35s]  oh okay there it is all right give me my warp core let's just get in here whoops any just
[29996.35s -> 30026.91s]  looking for writing let's go back there's the thing I plugged in it's two I want how much time
[30026.91s -> 30056.51s]  do I have I'm not sure I have enough time Larry and rude kindly tune the alignments on each black
[30056.51s -> 30061.15s]  hole core as I finish them schematic on the floor shows which warp tower aligns with which astro
[30061.15s -> 30067.37s]  body right speed future deliveries to ash twin I've tuned the first black hole core to activate
[30067.37s -> 30072.89s]  when it's a warp tower aligns with brutal hollow before anyone comments yes I am aware this reduces
[30072.89s -> 30078.86s]  the distance between yarrow and me schematic shows the six towers on ash twin are being tuned
[30078.86s -> 30085.40s]  only five alignments a mistake no that's correct for these alignments we've decided to treat the
[30085.40s -> 30093.23s]  hourglass twins as a single astral body right if it helps you can imagine the hourglass twins
[30093.23s -> 30098.25s]  is aligning with themselves have you seen flox's tower designs in the high energy lab on in between
[30098.25s -> 30104.03s]  they clarify each tower is a warp destination yeah we gotta figure that out all right we need
[30104.03s -> 30127.44s]  a warp core projection stone alignment one the sun alignment two hourglass yep alignment three
[30127.44s -> 30143.21s]  timber hearth yeah yep mm-hmm alignment five giants deep alignment for brittle hollow so
[30143.21s -> 30153.72s]  yeah they just correspond yep yep yep okay a little bit more writing here where am I taking
[30153.72s -> 30157.80s]  this first black hole core and where am I taking the remaining cores once they're ready
[30159.63s -> 30164.11s]  all the warp towers are being constructed on ash twins black hole cores will go there
[30165.31s -> 30170.12s]  my gratitude in that case poke larry I'm leaving for delivery I'll send yarrow your regards
[30171.00s -> 30175.45s]  look I returned to the ford shortly I'm going to catch up to root and help them deliver the
[30175.45s -> 30183.20s]  first core to ash twin just make sure yarrow receives it of course the white hole cores are
[30183.20s -> 30187.60s]  for the six warp receivers each warp tower leads to a different planet so that will be a greater
[30187.60s -> 30202.27s]  pain in your cervical spine that was on ash twin so it's just on ash twin somewhere delivered
[30203.80s -> 30227.47s]  someplace I need to find okay let's use the stone and go read I have good news yarrow the advanced
[30227.47s -> 30236.81s]  warp core is ready to be installed at the heart of the ash twin project I'm intrigued love everyone
[30236.81s -> 30247.64s]  on ash twin is excited to see it no it isn't is everything well at the forge don't worry love
[30247.64s -> 30251.80s]  poke is only nervous core is extraordinary and her design work is beautifully clever
[30252.44s -> 30257.40s]  the core's durability could still be improved I need more time ignore her yarrow the core is
[30257.40s -> 30262.32s]  finished and if my sister tells you otherwise then she will be finished as well killing your sister
[30262.32s -> 30288.17s]  what again this thing they're one looking at me why do they why are there two heads
[30305.93s -> 30347.44s]  um okay so now I know that the core is on ash twin I need teleport to ash twin
[30375.34s -> 30382.73s]  but I think I did everything I needed to do up there it's okay there was nothing else for me
[30382.73s -> 30389.05s]  to do up there there's no core up there it was it was on ash twin yeah I could have been way
[30389.05s -> 30393.29s]  more upset about that all right now let's break our legs and our spine
[30395.37s -> 30415.55s]  I'm trying to like scrape my face on that come on just die come on let me catch one of these
[30415.55s -> 30456.80s]  how have I not been hit by any straight power or something okay got a bunch of new info what have
[30456.80s -> 30464.48s]  I not done I don't have very many more connections ash twin is one of the only things that's a
[30464.48s -> 30502.72s]  question mark let's see where we're at now I call forge ash twin that leads to here ash twin
[30503.28s -> 30520.27s]  our designs yeah it's just ash twin so far the vessel has something to explore the ash twin as
[30520.27s -> 30526.40s]  well an advanced warp core was successfully forged and for installation at the heart of
[30526.40s -> 30533.04s]  the ash twin project like in the heart inside of ash twin at the very very middle
[30534.00s -> 30539.60s]  but just have to wait till the thing goes to zero and just go in the middle
[30561.47s -> 30589.88s]  let's try it I'm just I'm gonna just explore and see if I can ash twin I gotta get to the
[30589.88s -> 30607.77s]  heart of the ash twin too fast already I think I saved it how do I get to the heart of the ash
[30607.77s -> 30667.44s]  twin mine the equator yep always on equator okay so I have to get to the core of this
[30668.40s -> 30686.51s]  how is this still aligned I just flew 5 000 feet to the left it's not we're gonna rank
[30686.51s -> 30702.60s]  wink redemption um do I just wait till it gets to the very bottom the sand and just stay here
[30703.48s -> 30707.32s]  and just try to go right to the core right to where like the tootsie roll pop thing is
[30733.90s -> 30742.91s]  that's real this is real wait this is real wait this is real there's only one
[30742.91s -> 30757.90s]  for there's only one warp I know what I have to do there's one warp of both of these planets
[30758.78s -> 30769.92s]  I gotta warp from that one this one or vice versa I gotta work from this one into that one
[30769.92s -> 30792.12s]  let me give that a try I work in I work into myself so if there's the two tower one and I
[30792.12s -> 30801.23s]  warp into it like the fucking name of the goddamn game is called the two tower project of course
[30801.23s -> 30808.88s]  it's going to be the one that's the two the twin the twin tower one go into the twin tower one
[30808.88s -> 30846.65s]  teleport and there it is the ash twin project you'll see let me let me look let me see let me go
[30846.65s -> 30857.12s]  read it while we wait for this the sand to get out of here look ash twin ash twin towers design
[30857.68s -> 30895.85s]  now I got it that's I'm gonna teleport to myself wait for the sand all right there's the sun
[30896.81s -> 30899.37s]  looking for the is it this way or the other way let's see
[30901.45s -> 30931.90s]  there's the sun behind me tribes of scent where are they is it still taking too much time
[30932.78s -> 30958.51s]  where these are the towers come on here we go there are the two towers now I need to wait for
[30958.51s -> 30967.84s]  the sand to get down here and I'm going to teleport look at this there's a teleport thing here
[30972.51s -> 30989.52s]  and there is not one here I gotta stand right here I'm gonna wait until the sand goes over me
[30989.52s -> 30992.08s]  and I'm gonna teleport through into the sand in the yellow
[30998.41s -> 31006.72s]  oh not here I'm talking about one down under the glass speaking of which I gotta get the
[31006.72s -> 31049.93s]  fuck out of the way enough now for me to go okay so wait there's another one there's two
[31050.89s -> 31118.91s]  but this is broken wait is it gonna line am I gonna see it am I gonna see it I might see it
[31118.91s -> 31173.34s]  when is it gonna happen that it hasn't happened the ship is gone now wait here it comes here it
[31173.34s -> 31213.21s]  comes here it is I ow what these are all the faces 10 minutes 40 seconds receive data from previous
[31213.21s -> 31220.28s]  cycles masks receiving data from probe tracking module giant steep memory statue timber hearth
[31220.28s -> 31253.00s]  memory statue 12 minutes until end of cycle transmission I need a thing today we finished
[31253.00s -> 31259.24s]  the excavation of the ash twin here in this space we carved we will craft our most ambitious
[31259.24s -> 31270.14s]  project yet the ash twin project powerful enough to send information back in time how far we've
[31270.14s -> 31275.82s]  come since our experiments at the high energy lab I still can hardly believe Ramy's hypothesis was
[31275.82s -> 31283.47s]  true we've also finished relocating all subterranean plants we met while digging
[31284.43s -> 31288.22s]  we'll need to keep our eyes on how significantly we've altered the environment here
[31289.26s -> 31300.40s]  oak just sent the warp core for the final tower to us from the black hole forge now ash twin can
[31300.40s -> 31307.66s]  be connected with giants deep the cassava is working with havens to craft the orbital probe
[31307.66s -> 31315.42s]  cannon and with blocks of sculpting the memory statues hypothesis it was not by accident the
[31315.50s -> 31322.92s]  core of our warp tower was the last to be forged cores could have been forged faster
[31323.64s -> 31329.88s]  saba had interrupted my work less frequently to ask for updates the important point is we are
[31329.88s -> 31337.48s]  all connected through the ash twin now we made the internet is what they're saying and also that
[31337.48s -> 31354.99s]  i'm no longer needed for mediating your disagreements our friends on giant steep tested the orbital probe
[31354.99s -> 31361.31s]  cannon today malo tells me the cannon is doing well and that havens advocates more launch power
[31361.31s -> 31369.32s]  if anyone can coax the maximum power from a device havens can then if anyone can go to device into
[31369.32s -> 31374.20s]  exploding that too is likely havens perhaps i should check in with the oracle probe cannon crew
[31374.20s -> 31381.72s]  in the interest of safety would help to remind havens that malo his love will be one of the
[31381.80s -> 31384.84s]  nomi on board the cannon or is malo part of the problem
[31388.22s -> 31391.50s]  fox and dad's finished the memory statues today and they are truly remarkable
[31392.46s -> 31396.86s]  when the ash twin project succeeds or in the event that it fails the memory statues will activate
[31397.90s -> 31400.78s]  allowing us to gather more data before we shut down the project
[31405.05s -> 31411.61s]  high-end idea i've worked hard on the sun station and it is at last is complete everything goes as
[31411.61s -> 31416.97s]  planned the structure will prompt the sun's explosion which will in turn supply the power
[31416.97s -> 31433.34s]  the ash twin project requires my boomer belt activated okay when i press by their mental
[31433.34s -> 31442.08s]  fortitude this was the project's most difficult task in more ways than one we're nearly ready
[31442.08s -> 31446.96s]  to activate the ash twin project here is what will happen first the sun station will receive
[31446.96s -> 31452.75s]  the order to fire at the sun prompting it to explode using the energy from the resulting
[31453.39s -> 31457.71s]  ash twin project will send the order for the orbital probe cannon to fire back in time by
[31457.71s -> 31464.17s]  22 minutes exactly 22 minutes after these orders are received the sun station will again trigger
[31464.17s -> 31476.03s]  the supernova to send the probe data from this cannon's launch back in time in total each
[31476.03s -> 31480.83s]  cycle created by the ash twin project will last precisely 22 minutes we can end this cycle it
[31480.83s -> 31493.82s]  will these words are difficult to write the sun station did not work suppose we redesign the sun
[31493.82s -> 31499.10s]  station to generate power of that magnitude a supernova is still our only viable option
[31500.14s -> 31508.24s]  this is easier expressed than accomplished you can wait for the sun to explode on its natural
[31508.24s -> 31513.28s]  timeline if you prefer idea but you'll need to find some way to halt our aging process
[31514.56s -> 31519.37s]  i believe we can still find a way to create a supernova my friend don't lose hope
[31520.41s -> 31524.89s]  however this is the closest we have ever been the ash twin projects theoretically sound
[31525.61s -> 31535.60s]  we were only unable to power it perhaps there is another way final drawing we are halting our
[31535.60s -> 31542.48s]  research into creating a supernova for this moment comet has newly arrived in this solar system we're
[31542.48s -> 31546.96s]  anxious to explore it it's been a very long time since we last explored somewhere new
[31549.50s -> 31553.42s]  so we're excited to welcome this comet imagine what knowledge might be gained there
[31554.22s -> 31570.17s]  oh my god there's a lot of stones install the masks inside the ash twin project blocks
[31570.17s -> 31577.34s]  they look beautiful although i feel like i'm being observed it's comforting to know the statues will
[31577.34s -> 31582.62s]  not pair until the project succeeds otherwise i imagine the experience would be hard to endure
[31582.62s -> 31588.35s]  i read this already daily they only need to activate once the project succeeds as a safety
[31588.35s -> 31594.51s]  measure however the statues will also activate in the event of equipment failure they will why is
[31594.51s -> 31599.79s]  that if anything goes wrong with the astron the statues and the mass will make us aware of the
[31599.79s -> 31604.03s]  situation and enable us to fix it otherwise it would be possible for us to remain permanently
[31604.03s -> 31607.63s]  unaware of the problem i hadn't thought of that what a profoundly hurtful fate
[31610.36s -> 31626.20s]  we're trying to be trying to fix it okay it's just it's it's the total recap this ore should
[31626.20s -> 31631.00s]  be the last we'll need for the ash twin project it's exciting news can i offer an extra set of
[31631.24s -> 31637.08s]  this final check delighted to help be grateful if you would the more eyes the better
[31638.68s -> 31644.25s]  once we finish the shell that seals off the core we'll check to ensure there are no longer any
[31644.25s -> 31650.22s]  physical entrances ramie and i will be checking the interior and then the exterior for cracks our
[31650.22s -> 31673.02s]  final safety check mr lore wall where i think i've seen the rest of these almost prepared to
[31673.02s -> 31684.52s]  receive the probe data yeah we've seen these yep yep yep i'm looking for the eye of the universe
[31684.52s -> 31700.24s]  like i got these old i have good news the advanced warp core is ready to be installed
[31700.24s -> 31706.16s]  to the heart of the ash twin project is where i am no it isn't yes it is everything well to forge
[31706.16s -> 31722.52s]  don't worry yeah we read this like five minutes ago okay we're good artificial gravity control
[31726.57s -> 31763.92s]  um wonderful i activate first wait that's what hold on this is the teleporter to over there
[31767.23s -> 31804.17s]  turn on this wait we're flying around you're about to access the core while the ash twin
[31804.17s -> 31830.64s]  project is active removing the core will disable the ash twin project what there it is i got it
[31831.20s -> 31880.30s]  okay now we have to we gotta leave now i have the core i've got it i've got the core to power the
[31880.30s -> 31908.17s]  ship let's go where's the ship i gotta go put this in the core i don't know where to put it
[31909.21s -> 31933.88s]  i don't know where to put it in my ship all right it's going in my ship i can't i can't get to where
[31933.88s -> 31949.71s]  this needs to go fast enough i can't get to where it needs to go fast enough but wait hold on wait
[31949.71s -> 31963.13s]  the project isn't going buckle up there's no supernova don't fly into the fucking sun don't
[31963.13s -> 31978.73s]  fly into the fucking sun the fuck just hit me okay now i gotta go um um i have to fly to dark
[31978.73s -> 32000.19s]  ramble wait why is everything getting sucked into the sun throw it into the sun no what throw
[32000.19s -> 32051.77s]  the core into the sun where's dark ramble this music is driving me crazy okay i need to shoot
[32052.57s -> 32064.36s]  the um i need to shoot the thing into the beacon to get to the vessel so i can get there right
[32065.16s -> 32077.18s]  i have to shoot the beacon into the thing i'm going 15 trillion miles per hour
[32077.74s -> 32107.63s]  oh my god oh my god just don't get in no okay i need to mark the distress signal on my
[32107.63s -> 32117.93s]  on my i'm gonna mark the distress signal on my thing yep where's the vessel uh the the this here
[32118.89s -> 32142.06s]  okay all right we're good wait no i don't i found it already i already found it i found it already
[32142.06s -> 32174.70s]  uh the fish are still here though so i can still die from a fish if i die from a fish
[32175.42s -> 32182.20s]  i'm gonna be really mad if i crash into something and explode i'm gonna be really mad
[32183.00s -> 32200.22s]  what are the symbols i gotta look at my notes but here's the thing i have all the time in the world
[32206.59s -> 32225.12s]  i could just coast for like three hours that's what i'm gonna do oh you motherfucker
[32225.84s -> 32305.24s]  what's going on did i hear something why did it explode i disabled the project yeah so it

[32369.23s -> 32381.48s]  it you dumbass i have to time i have to i have to speed up time anyways so you know what just
[32382.28s -> 32385.74s]  just do it i fucking have to speed up sleep
[32403.29s -> 32407.60s]  what it takes to fucking destroy a goddamn ship i won't i'll never know
[32409.42s -> 32420.88s]  i have to make i have to sit at the fire the fireplace like three four minutes i gotta sit
[32420.88s -> 32430.44s]  at the fireplace so that i don't stand around for five minutes ten minutes i thought i had all the
[32431.40s -> 32464.09s]  world emote only we can't help him but we can't hurt him either i'm gonna do four minutes i also
[32464.09s -> 32476.36s]  want to look at what the symbols are because i'm not gonna have very much time i didn't do
[32476.36s -> 32499.52s]  anything a zit just popped on my forehead i didn't do anything i didn't touch it one more for all
[32499.52s -> 32531.42s]  time's sake no no i wanted a marshmallow get me out of here what are the symbols no fuck it no all
[32531.42s -> 32555.28s]  right just just go to the planet we could just look up teleport to that weird place grab the
[32555.28s -> 32564.96s]  core park the ship in a safe spot get the hell to the bramble and go by the way there were two
[32564.96s -> 32571.18s]  errors there was an error in error it's it's the red one then the white one right you can help me
[32571.18s -> 32604.96s]  out on this i don't care help me please i'm so close there's a wink all right this is not the
[32604.96s -> 32661.12s]  right one oh get me in there this is a blindfold run um yeah pretty tough it's the broken one
[32662.00s -> 32670.46s]  come on get me in before the whole cycle goes through i've got to grab this
[32671.26s -> 32675.07s]  okay here we go got to grab that warp port
[32704.97s -> 32726.76s]  why is it not happening this time um why did it not happen
[32730.36s -> 32759.28s]  why did it not happen i didn't jump i didn't jump i got what what okay sir but honest to god
[32759.28s -> 32765.77s]  what happened to myself do i have to bump my head and then fall back down
[32775.36s -> 32779.20s]  sand pulled you off of it well how are you supposed to stay on this how are you supposed
[32779.20s -> 32801.26s]  to stand still sand's gonna do this every time i even reach it from here
[32801.26s -> 32810.97s]  i like to throw myself into space it's kind of but it's not gonna help
[32812.57s -> 32850.78s]  please just do this okay that's i missed the cycle i'm losing a lot of time here too though
[32850.78s -> 32856.38s]  and now i have to wait oh god damn it i have to reset the whole thing can i get in there and do
[32856.38s -> 32885.39s]  it right now just the sand went up more well here we go so i i have to stand in this here so i don't
[32885.39s -> 32898.30s]  get sucked up and then go just go like this wait under the lip here that's that's come on
[32899.53s -> 32942.83s]  that that is a like dot dot dot come dot dot dot on you know like come on this is gonna stop me
[32943.63s -> 32997.13s]  am i in the right spot stand on the blue i no stand under the thing okay here we go
[32997.13s -> 33036.43s]  one two three are you sure you want to proceed yes windows fucking authorization bullshit
[33037.87s -> 33064.89s]  okay okay okay
[33090.72s -> 33125.87s]  what the fuck is happening i turned on autopilot started reading a book let's go wait wait wait
[33125.87s -> 33138.99s]  what hold on can i teleport to dark dark teleport dark bramble try teleport dark bramble no okay
[33138.99s -> 33167.92s]  and we've confirmed we've confirmed it's red first and then white right just red no white then red
[33168.24s -> 33174.16s]  my god i'm going really fast i'm sorry i have to fucking look at chat i tell you it's that's
[33174.16s -> 33180.49s]  fucking stressful is it red white then red please tell me the truth please tell me the truth don't
[33180.49s -> 33188.73s]  lie to me i'm not now all the marker that's what i'm saying there's two markers red okay i'm going
[33188.73s -> 33226.48s]  to listen to fucking six of you no why is the end of the game like this
[33227.44s -> 33251.69s]  uh i can't even go fast in there because the angler fish are in there and now i have to do
[33251.69s -> 33265.24s]  this all over again i can't i got a checkpoint with this fucking stupid thing in my hand
[33265.88s -> 33315.71s]  i didn't use a campfire thank god germa doesn't have a real job why because it's late yes oh
[33317.07s -> 33324.11s]  let me go over here let me assess you as a person so it is in the video game out of wild it seems
[33324.11s -> 33328.67s]  that you have you didn't go quickly to the red dot fast enough for me to i'm sorry gonna have
[33328.67s -> 33333.71s]  to dock you a few points a second restaurant waiter i can't believe it yeah i just i couldn't
[33333.71s -> 33353.61s]  i couldn't believe it yeah no no no i was going over your i was going over your resume guy that
[33353.61s -> 33361.53s]  drives a bus and uh how come you didn't see the there was more writing that was on the wall there
[33361.61s -> 33368.41s]  that you didn't you didn't look at i'm upset by this therefore you can no longer drive a bus
[33368.41s -> 33393.69s]  oh yeah wrong fucking planet i can't even drive a bus all right i'm gonna try this one more time
[33393.69s -> 33409.10s]  and i'm gonna youtube the ending it's been almost nine and a half hours don't you dare what does it
[33409.10s -> 33417.29s]  really matter if i youtube the last eight minutes of the game i'm gonna i'm youtubeing it i'm gonna
[33417.29s -> 33424.51s]  youtube it i can't believe i have to fly through bramble place again i'm youtubeing it i'm gonna
[33424.51s -> 33435.93s]  youtube.com slash fucking no you know i'm just gonna open up the wikipedia page of this game and
[33435.93s -> 33460.00s]  just read the end and one sentence am i still on the equator yes oh my god i just want to be done
[33473.61s -> 33474.73s]  this is is it far enough
[33515.05s -> 33523.53s]  please man i just can i fucking just shut the warp core i can't even go wait no god exists god
[33523.53s -> 33549.10s]  exists it's gonna fall back down to us where am i fuck me man i have i need that ship to fly to the
[33549.10s -> 33563.90s]  bramble place you still didn't watch like a deer in headlights yeah because i'm at the end of the
[33563.90s -> 33571.71s]  tunnel and the tunnel has no oxygen in it and i have to go through it and hold my breath and
[33571.71s -> 33595.98s]  fucking just try i'm trying it one more time just read game boomers instead i'm at the final part
[33595.98s -> 33607.31s]  of the game this is actually the end of the whole game this is the it i just have to do this i just
[33607.31s -> 33621.71s]  have to wait for the stupid fucking god damn it i'm going to bed somebody said that they didn't
[33621.71s -> 33637.50s]  have campfires before a patch how many times have they patched the end of this game three times
[33637.50s -> 33666.00s]  they've patched this game four times for the end of the game this is gonna be the one
[33697.88s -> 33705.48s]  he hates us he hates this game he hates everything no it's just it's just having to
[33705.48s -> 33732.96s]  fly through the bramble place again and get eaten by a fucking monster kind of sucks you're not
[33732.96s -> 33757.28s]  gonna actually kill me again all right is autopilot gonna kill me here autopilot was going really
[33757.28s -> 33767.04s]  really fast and it was gonna go right into the sun all right can i not make it like 30 for 30
[33767.04s -> 33794.33s]  landing right on the equator that would be great if i that would be fantastic get me the fuck out
[33794.33s -> 33825.48s]  of this boat all right now i got another minute or two it's the one after the sun
[33838.81s -> 33865.40s]  uh who's your favorite girl from what love lied i don't i don't know what that is i'm gonna say
[33865.40s -> 33876.96s]  i'm gonna just say um all right let's get it first try let's get the hell out of this
[33877.68s -> 33896.67s]  and then put this thing in and then i also need to type in the code so what's the code
[33897.39s -> 33913.13s]  don't worry about the code i have to write this code down don't i which one's broken come on
[33917.76s -> 33921.36s]  where's the mechanic where i can smash my fucking head into the wall and have
[33921.36s -> 33993.18s]  10 minutes go by okay let's go so have we confirmed red then white then red or white then red then
[33993.18s -> 34021.88s]  white because there's two fake ones yes i know put it on all right come on let's go technically
[34021.88s -> 34055.69s]  either will work the white one avoids the fish okay here we go where's my ship where is it
[34056.65s -> 34079.07s]  far away right here okay coordinates set them set them here we go this is the one
[34079.95s -> 34117.53s]  we're going white first and then i'm going to try to float gracefully into red going too slow
[34117.53s -> 34122.88s]  the one time that i'm going too slow we're going red first and then we're going to gracefully
[34122.88s -> 34127.40s]  float into you guys told me let's go just i'm not looking at chat no more chatting no more
[34127.40s -> 34134.54s]  chatting no more chatting no more chatting no more chat for me oh my fucking god i gotta make
[34134.54s -> 34144.76s]  it a good shot red but there's a fucking there could be a fish right there there's a fish
[34144.76s -> 34168.16s]  next to me or something there's a fish i can't move there's a fish don't pump them i have to
[34168.16s -> 34180.59s]  bump anybody don't pump anybody okay there's the vessel 1.2 kilometers that way don't fucking
[34180.59s -> 34187.42s]  floor it no how much time do i have anybody have any ideas like 10 seconds 30 like 10 minutes
[34187.42s -> 34193.42s]  one minute five minutes floor it i can't floor it i can't floor i can't flour it there's everywhere
[34193.42s -> 34202.48s]  i don't know where to go i can't floor it i'm going too slow i can't floor it i can't
[34202.48s -> 34215.82s]  or you're a coward floor it i motherfuck i can't floor it you're gonna run out of time i'm gonna
[34216.70s -> 34256.44s]  i have to move a little bit is it safe here fish here fish here fish pull the fish here nope
[34256.44s -> 34269.02s]  No fish here, there's no fish here.
[34269.02s -> 34270.06s]  Floor it, floor it, floor it.
[34270.06s -> 34272.78s]  Get in, get in, and just go and type in the code.
[34272.78s -> 34273.66s]  What's the code?
[34283.66s -> 34284.82s]  Am I in it?
[34284.82s -> 34288.16s]  I'm like tilted.
[34288.16s -> 34295.15s]  Am I in it?
[34295.15s -> 34299.99s]  No, no, no, no, wrong way, wrong way.
[34299.99s -> 34302.57s]  There it is, there it is.
[34302.57s -> 34303.77s]  Ah!
[34303.77s -> 34305.51s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[34305.51s -> 34307.43s]  Put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in,
[34307.43s -> 34309.19s]  put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in,
[34309.19s -> 34310.67s]  put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in.
[34310.67s -> 34314.39s]  Okay, slow down, whoa, Betsy.
[34314.39s -> 34318.17s]  Slow down, put it in.
[34318.49s -> 34326.08s]  I can't see you.
[34326.08s -> 34330.55s]  Now is not the time for the, you would have to,
[34330.55s -> 34332.83s]  what the fuck is going on right now?
[34332.83s -> 34333.67s]  Is there any?
[34339.92s -> 34341.00s]  Quartets.
[34341.00s -> 34342.04s]  Okay, quartets, R.
[34352.13s -> 34352.97s]  Is that it?
[34352.97s -> 34353.79s]  That's it, right?
[34353.79s -> 34359.80s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah?
[34359.80s -> 34360.92s]  How do I say yes?
[34360.92s -> 34372.34s]  How do I accept?
[34372.34s -> 34373.46s]  Put it in the bottom left.
[34373.46s -> 34380.75s]  Go down to the, then to the right.
[34380.75s -> 34386.05s]  This next one is, oh my God, here, here, here, here.
[34386.61s -> 34389.77s]  Here, confirm.
[34389.77s -> 34391.25s]  Last one is all fucked up.
[34391.25s -> 34392.85s]  Last one's all fucked up.
[34392.85s -> 34394.81s]  Let me get it right.
[34394.81s -> 34400.62s]  Bottom left corner, bottom left corner.
[34400.62s -> 34441.48s]  Up, around the whole thing, down.
[34441.48s -> 34448.12s]  Looks like we made it, excellent job.
[34448.12s -> 34450.04s]  You finally found the core,
[34450.04s -> 34454.40s]  meaning the eye of the universe.
[34454.40s -> 34464.50s]  I might not have time, I don't care about jokes.
[34464.50s -> 34472.64s]  I might actually not have time for this.
[34472.64s -> 34473.48s]  How are this?
[34529.08s -> 34537.59s]  What is that?
[34537.59s -> 34554.96s]  That's the sun.
[34554.96s -> 34573.92s]  Oh, it's those rocks, it's the quantum rocks.
[34573.92s -> 34587.29s]  Why is this thing making human noises?
[34587.29s -> 34591.44s]  What are you doing?
[34591.44s -> 34614.46s]  Oxygen refueling.
[34614.46s -> 34619.84s]  Ah, I'm doing that, you're trying to block me.
[34619.84s -> 34622.28s]  Okay, there's an opening up here.
[34647.41s -> 34649.00s]  What?
[34649.00s -> 34649.84s]  Go down the toilet?
[34663.32s -> 34678.94s]  Can I stand on this?
[34678.94s -> 34680.00s]  Connection lost.
[34699.11s -> 34716.25s]  Um, fuck.
[34722.00s -> 34722.92s]  I just jump in it?
[34725.92s -> 34731.99s]  Wait.
[34744.84s -> 34752.32s]  Imagine if I died.
[34752.32s -> 34757.48s]  I would fucking laugh so hard.
[34757.48s -> 34763.01s]  I think I can climb that.
[34763.01s -> 34773.76s]  Hold on, I can get there from here.
[34773.76s -> 34775.58s]  Oh, oh, it goes upside down.
[34782.59s -> 34785.23s]  Me and my custom switch remote.
[34785.23s -> 34788.19s]  One of my Joy-Cons, the right Joy-Con.
[34788.19s -> 34801.56s]  Brought it this far.
[34801.56s -> 34804.24s]  Wink, we're literally at the fucking big reveals.
[34813.68s -> 34831.10s]  Child's Adventures was founded by Feldspar,
[34831.10s -> 34832.62s]  Goss and Slade and Hornfels to explore
[34832.62s -> 34849.77s]  the solar system at the end of the universe.
[34849.77s -> 34851.61s]  The Nomai never got to see it for themselves,
[34851.61s -> 34853.73s]  but thanks to their efforts and technology,
[34853.73s -> 34875.42s]  a hearthene was able to reach the eye of the universe.
[34875.42s -> 34876.34s]  At the end of its lifespan,
[34876.34s -> 34878.10s]  our sun collapsed on its own gravity
[34878.10s -> 34884.40s]  and then exploded in a violent supernova.
[34884.40s -> 34912.85s]  You're really fucking ruining this ending, aren't you?
[34912.85s -> 34914.33s]  The Nomai who came to our solar system
[34914.33s -> 34917.09s]  were following a signal from the eye of the universe.
[34917.09s -> 34919.45s]  It perished when the interloper arrived,
[34919.45s -> 34920.89s]  bringing with it the deadly substance
[34920.89s -> 34922.93s]  we call the ghost matter
[34922.93s -> 34924.65s]  that flooded the entire solar system
[34924.65s -> 34954.29s]  almost instantly and without warning.
[34954.29s -> 34966.22s]  Missed the plaque.
[34966.22s -> 34968.04s]  Of all the life forms who will perish
[34968.04s -> 34969.72s]  in the oncoming death of the universe,
[34969.72s -> 34978.21s]  we will miss the anglerfish the least.
[34978.21s -> 34997.16s]  I mean, fairly rude.
[34997.16s -> 34998.84s]  Hornfels observations.
[34998.84s -> 34999.68s]  This is incredible.
[34999.68s -> 35000.68s]  At first I thought the points of light
[35000.68s -> 35002.28s]  in this image were stars, but they're not.
[35002.28s -> 35004.12s]  They're galaxies.
[35004.12s -> 35006.24s]  And this image covers just a tiny patch of the whole sky,
[35006.24s -> 35007.48s]  which means the universe contains
[35007.48s -> 35009.24s]  at least a thousand times more galaxies
[35009.24s -> 35011.28s]  than we previously thought.
[35011.44s -> 35014.07s]  I think I need to sit down.
[35014.07s -> 35014.91s]  This is odd.
[35014.91s -> 35016.99s]  According to my redshift calculations,
[35016.99s -> 35020.51s]  every single galaxy in this image is moving away from us.
[35020.51s -> 35021.95s]  In fact, the farther away a galaxy is,
[35021.95s -> 35024.47s]  the faster it appears to be moving away.
[35024.47s -> 35027.67s]  Almost as if the entire universe is expanding.
[35027.67s -> 35028.95s]  But that's true.
[35028.95s -> 35031.07s]  Was everything closer together in the past?
[35031.07s -> 35032.91s]  And how far back can we extrapolate?
[35032.91s -> 35034.67s]  Did the universe have a beginning?
[35092.05s -> 35092.89s]  Ow!
[35104.52s -> 35124.06s]  I'm just in a forest now.
[35124.10s -> 35134.82s]  That's pretty, yeah.
[35134.82s -> 35136.38s]  I was planning, I hear somebody playing something.
[35136.38s -> 35138.28s]  What's over there?
[35138.28s -> 35166.28s]  It's a blue.
[35166.28s -> 35171.75s]  When do I get to go home?
[35171.75s -> 35225.32s]  This is a dinosaur track.
[35225.32s -> 35256.54s]  A quantum campfire?
[35256.54s -> 35283.39s]  Did I just spit that into my helmet?
[35283.39s -> 35285.55s]  Hi, Phil, whatever your name is.
[35285.55s -> 35298.09s]  Esker, do you hear music?
[35298.09s -> 35334.50s]  Did I be hearing music?
[35334.50s -> 35387.34s]  Is somebody in here?
[35387.34s -> 35403.62s]  Gather, I have a banjo.
[35403.62s -> 35409.80s]  I guess I'm gonna bring it back to you.
[35409.80s -> 35419.15s]  You can have this.
[35419.15s -> 35421.91s]  You're here.
[35421.91s -> 35423.51s]  It's not quite time yet.
[35423.51s -> 35425.67s]  I'm pretty sure we'll need the others for this next part.
[35425.67s -> 35427.71s]  We'll need, you know, everyone.
[35427.71s -> 35428.87s]  Don't rush, take your time.
[35428.87s -> 35430.71s]  It might not even exist here.
[35437.46s -> 35438.90s]  All right, I'm gonna fucking quantum yeet
[35438.90s -> 35440.34s]  these motherfuckers out of here in a second.
[35440.34s -> 35471.32s]  Here we go.
[35471.32s -> 35473.67s]  Hi, can I die here?
[35473.67s -> 35497.24s]  Can I die here?
[35497.24s -> 35498.08s]  I don't get it.
[35498.08s -> 35504.56s]  Why am I gathering all these random people?
[35504.56s -> 35505.96s]  Feldspar, Hatchling, you found me.
[35505.96s -> 35507.56s]  Nice to have company around a campfire, isn't it?
[35507.56s -> 35508.40s]  Go on, get the others.
[35508.40s -> 35509.24s]  Wouldn't you want them?
[35509.24s -> 35510.72s]  I wouldn't want them to miss it out.
[35545.49s -> 35549.68s]  What the fuck did I just get?
[35549.68s -> 35551.08s]  It was Santa Claus.
[35551.08s -> 35554.04s]  Stars are beautiful, weren't they?
[35554.04s -> 35565.54s]  Even if our star is what ultimately killed us.
[35565.54s -> 35574.99s]  I'll wait here, remember them while you gather everybody.
[35574.99s -> 35576.75s]  What are you guys looking at?
[35576.75s -> 35579.63s]  Okay, you're building a skeleton ladder.
[35579.63s -> 35601.52s]  What did you gather?
[35601.52s -> 35630.22s]  Mask, zoo.
[35630.22s -> 35692.15s]  Hypothesis, everyone must be here.
[35692.15s -> 35694.49s]  Once they arrive, I believe we'll be ready.
[35694.49s -> 35711.29s]  I'm gonna go to the other side of the ladder.
[35711.29s -> 35714.01s]  I'm gonna go to the other side of the ladder.
[35714.25s -> 35716.01s]  Once they arrive, I believe we'll be ready.
[35716.01s -> 35717.17s]  Glad you remembered me.
[35719.51s -> 35722.44s]  Collecting all my friends.
[35722.44s -> 35742.89s]  Quiet shade across old bark in the ancient glade.
[35747.60s -> 35771.25s]  It's always dark.
[35771.25s -> 35775.36s]  Okay, is that everybody?
[35775.36s -> 35779.84s]  That's everybody.
[35779.84s -> 35786.63s]  There ain't nobody else.
[35786.63s -> 35787.87s]  What do you say, time buddy?
[35787.87s -> 35789.88s]  Ready to start the music?
[35789.88s -> 35802.25s]  Yeah, this should be cool.
[35802.25s -> 35817.72s]  Get it going, play.
[35817.72s -> 35819.00s]  Conscious observers enter the eye.
[35819.00s -> 35820.56s]  I wonder what happens now.
[35820.56s -> 35821.40s]  Is it time to find out?
[35821.48s -> 35839.79s]  Not yet.
[35839.79s -> 35842.41s]  They all play together.
[35842.41s -> 35844.61s]  They've been playing the same songs in random places,
[35844.61s -> 35846.05s]  but it all matches up.
[35849.26s -> 35870.86s]  Into the fire.
[35870.86s -> 35877.52s]  Really burning.
[35877.52s -> 35878.92s]  Let's find out.
[35878.92s -> 35917.27s]  This song is new to me, but I'm honored to be a part of it.
[35917.27s -> 35920.28s]  You made a fucking party balloon.
[35920.28s -> 35921.88s]  I believe we've reached the end of our journey.
[35921.88s -> 35923.28s]  All that remains is to collapse
[35923.28s -> 35930.59s]  the innumerable possibilities before us.
[35930.59s -> 35945.20s]  Your curiosity friend, let's find out.
[35945.20s -> 35946.56s]  Cut a little close, don't you think?
[35946.56s -> 35948.28s]  Well, it worked out all right in the end, I suppose.
[35948.52s -> 35953.88s]  I hope there are beasties in the next one.
[35953.88s -> 35955.36s]  How long has it been since I got to make music
[35955.36s -> 35956.48s]  with everyone around Campfire?
[35956.48s -> 35960.68s]  I'm really happy we're all here.
[35960.68s -> 35962.20s]  Yet if it's over now, I had a good time learning,
[35962.20s -> 35965.12s]  but I think the rules are about to change.
[35965.12s -> 35966.96s]  I learned a lot by the end of everything.
[35966.96s -> 35969.88s]  Past is the past now, but that's okay.
[35969.88s -> 35971.60s]  It's never really gone completely.
[35971.60s -> 35972.84s]  Future is always built on the past,
[35972.84s -> 35975.28s]  even if we won't get to see it.
[35975.28s -> 35979.65s]  Still, it's time for something new.
[35979.65s -> 35980.81s]  Time for something new.
[36016.53s -> 36051.10s]  We're just going into the light, apparently.
[36051.10s -> 36057.73s]  Okay, so we went, we blew up,
[36063.71s -> 36070.57s]  restarted the universe, rebirthed the whole universe.
[36080.96s -> 36083.32s]  We just made a new, yeah, just make a new one.
[36092.04s -> 36094.92s]  That was pretty crazy ending sequence.
[36094.92s -> 36096.68s]  That was kind of all over the place.
[36103.43s -> 36109.65s]  That was really good.
[36109.65s -> 36110.89s]  You wanted to YouTube it.
[36112.52s -> 36117.58s]  No, I just didn't wanna fucking keep failing.
[36120.40s -> 36121.96s]  How would I have ever YouTubed that?
[36121.96s -> 36130.44s]  We would have watched somebody else stream the game.
[36130.44s -> 36132.00s]  What are your first impressions?
[36136.44s -> 36137.84s]  I love time travel.
[36137.84s -> 36140.60s]  That's a really cool concept.
[36140.60s -> 36141.48s]  I feel like this is one of those games
[36141.48s -> 36147.32s]  that I'm gonna wanna go read the Reddit or the Wikipedia
[36147.32s -> 36149.16s]  and just kind of reprocess everything
[36149.16s -> 36151.40s]  and have people tell me how cool everything is.
[36163.50s -> 36173.48s]  There's still things I didn't do, yeah.
[36173.48s -> 36176.12s]  I can see why people say this is one
[36176.12s -> 36177.32s]  of their favorite games last year.
[36177.32s -> 36178.60s]  I can understand it.
[36179.60s -> 36180.44s]  Makes sense.
[36181.28s -> 36195.23s]  Pretty unique.
[36195.23s -> 36199.81s]  No, I only got frustrated at like two parts.
[36199.81s -> 36203.97s]  The sand taking a long time was always,
[36203.97s -> 36215.14s]  no, that started frustrating me a little bit.
[36215.14s -> 36216.10s]  Hates the sand.
[36217.41s -> 36220.86s]  This was a college project.
[36220.86s -> 36223.26s]  Was this actually a college project?
[36223.26s -> 36224.86s]  Wait, what?
[36224.86s -> 36228.75s]  No, there's like 500 people on this game.
[36228.75s -> 36230.23s]  It's not a college.
[36230.23s -> 36234.47s]  I thought like, wait, did an entire college make this?
[36239.55s -> 36251.84s]  Every student apparently had something to do with it.
[36251.84s -> 36253.40s]  Started as a college project.
[36258.20s -> 36260.08s]  That was really, really cool.
[36260.08s -> 36263.62s]  I'm glad I experienced it.
[36263.62s -> 36267.23s]  You were so angry, you had a zit pop on its own.
[36267.23s -> 36268.87s]  Explain the story.
[36268.87s -> 36269.71s]  Sure.
[36270.88s -> 36273.56s]  There was this civilization of people
[36273.56s -> 36277.84s]  that wanted to find as much knowledge as they possibly could.
[36278.76s -> 36281.40s]  They came, well, while they were doing research
[36281.40s -> 36283.80s]  and they ended up on this galaxy,
[36283.80s -> 36287.48s]  they figured out that, uh-oh, this sun's going to explode.
[36289.07s -> 36291.27s]  This sun's gonna supernova and we're all dead.
[36291.27s -> 36292.27s]  We gotta find a way to try to,
[36292.27s -> 36294.27s]  we gotta make a way to stop it.
[36294.27s -> 36299.27s]  So they get together and they have a bunch of people
[36299.27s -> 36301.63s]  that are working on projects.
[36301.63s -> 36303.51s]  And then one of those people figures out,
[36303.51s -> 36305.95s]  dude, there's a comet here that's killing everybody.
[36305.95s -> 36307.59s]  And they all die from the comet.
[36308.89s -> 36314.32s]  And then you come in and you have to pick up the pieces
[36314.84s -> 36318.30s]  and solve the mystery that they left behind
[36318.30s -> 36341.32s]  as to why this super omega wrong.
[36341.32s -> 36344.73s]  Well, here's why this game's kind of hard to understand.
[36344.73s -> 36348.05s]  Because there's no one, two, three, four, or five
[36348.05s -> 36350.81s]  sequences or anything like that,
[36350.81s -> 36356.12s]  you can get this game's story like two, six, one, three, five.
[36357.48s -> 36387.92s]  So you can, wait, 14.3 billion years later.
[36387.92s -> 36389.76s]  I mean, you're also telling me to explain
[36389.76s -> 36392.24s]  an incredibly complicated, complex,
[36392.24s -> 36395.96s]  intertwining time travel story after 10 plus hours
[36395.96s -> 36408.76s]  sitting on a live stream talking to you guys.
[36408.76s -> 36410.36s]  I'm a little fried.
[36410.36s -> 36418.12s]  What was that that flew by?
[36418.12s -> 36420.04s]  That's you overshooting the planet.
[36430.44s -> 36432.20s]  That was the best joke of the whole night
[36432.20s -> 36436.80s]  and I had nothing to do with it.
[36436.80s -> 36438.00s]  All right, that's it.
[36438.00s -> 36439.96s]  Out of Wilds in the books in the bag.
[36453.92s -> 36456.90s]  All right, let's give it a letter grade.
[36456.90s -> 36464.72s]  Think here, this is gonna be tricky.
[36464.72s -> 36467.22s]  It's gonna be tricky.
[36467.22s -> 36468.62s]  I don't think this is an A plus.
[36468.62s -> 36478.82s]  Nope, I don't think so.
[36478.82s -> 36483.08s]  I'm not sure this is an A either.
[36483.08s -> 36490.42s]  I don't think this is a, I don't think this is a B.
[36490.42s -> 36495.30s]  A plus, I don't think so.
[36495.30s -> 36497.10s]  No, no, I'm not talking about going down.
[36497.10s -> 36499.22s]  Like, oh, I don't think there's just a C.
[36499.22s -> 36501.38s]  It's a C minus, no, no, no.
[36501.38s -> 36504.10s]  That's not, I'm saying I don't,
[36504.10s -> 36511.61s]  you're misconstruing what I'm saying.
[36512.01s -> 36514.64s]  I'm gonna give it a B plus.
[36514.64s -> 36519.29s]  I'm gonna give this an 89.
[36519.29s -> 36525.03s]  I'm gonna give this an 89.
[36525.03s -> 36542.10s]  Could've been a 90, could've been 89.
[36542.10s -> 36543.54s]  What would I dock points for?
[36552.08s -> 36553.20s]  You don't have to care what other things.
[36553.20s -> 36559.49s]  Give us your own score, 89.
[36559.49s -> 36560.85s]  What am I comparing it to?
[36564.88s -> 36568.52s]  I don't know.
[36568.52s -> 36571.12s]  Well, if you have a 10, you have a 10 point skill.
[36571.12s -> 36574.74s]  10 is the best game I've ever played in my life.
[36574.74s -> 36578.38s]  10 is the best thing you've ever done in your life.
[36578.38s -> 36588.64s]  A 10 out of 10.
[36588.64s -> 36590.56s]  Metacritic gave this an 85.
[36590.56s -> 36593.24s]  Yeah, but that's from a million different places.
[36599.47s -> 36601.67s]  89 out of 100 is,
[36601.67s -> 36603.91s]  I tell everybody I know that this was worth playing
[36603.91s -> 36606.70s]  and you should play it and it was great.
[36606.70s -> 36610.94s]  But for me, when you climb into like the 90s,
[36610.94s -> 36613.18s]  like 90, 91, 92, 93,
[36614.67s -> 36616.39s]  like for instance, last year,
[36616.39s -> 36617.71s]  this came out last year.
[36617.71s -> 36619.91s]  Resident Evil 2 for me was like a 95.
[36620.59s -> 36633.04s]  So an 89, that's very close.
[36633.56s -> 36648.25s]  Being my favorite game that came out last year.
[36648.25s -> 36650.01s]  Imagine being so dumb that you compare this
[36650.01s -> 36651.01s]  to Resident Evil 2.
[36651.01s -> 36651.85s]  What?
[36651.85s -> 36652.89s]  I didn't, wait, when did I say,
[36652.89s -> 36655.49s]  you know my favorite part is the zombies?
[36655.49s -> 36657.85s]  I said Resident Evil 2 was a 95 for me
[36657.85s -> 36659.81s]  and that was my favorite game of last year.
[36659.81s -> 36662.37s]  So a game that came out last year as well that's an 89
[36662.37s -> 36663.89s]  is pretty damn close to my favorite game
[36663.89s -> 36676.34s]  that came out last year is what I'm trying to say.
[36676.34s -> 36677.62s]  What's a 10 out of 10?
[36677.62s -> 36680.23s]  Team Fortress 2.
[36680.91s -> 36684.56s]  And this game was not as good as TF2.
[36684.56s -> 36688.08s]  Oh, fuck.
[36688.08s -> 36690.24s]  Okay, I can only be a dick for so long
[36690.24s -> 36693.20s]  before I have to fucking stop.
[36693.20s -> 36698.04s]  All right, so that was very, very good.
[36698.04s -> 36700.12s]  I am happy I played it.
[36700.12s -> 36701.52s]  It was a great recommendation.
[36701.52s -> 36702.36s]  I'm glad I played it.
[36702.36s -> 36714.49s]  It was very good.
[36714.49s -> 36717.04s]  Where's Bloodborne on that scale?
[36717.04s -> 36718.79s]  98.
[36718.79s -> 36720.43s]  Bloodborne is in 98.
[36720.43s -> 36722.11s]  It's only two basis points,
[36722.11s -> 36725.29s]  two points are taken off because it's 30 FPS.
[36725.29s -> 36733.41s]  If that game is 60 FPS, it's 100.
[36733.41s -> 36734.97s]  All right, we're gonna be doing Tony Hawk tomorrow,
[36734.97s -> 36737.92s]  Tony Hawk Underground.
[36737.92s -> 36740.34s]  Should be a lot of fun.
[36740.34s -> 36741.54s]  That was Outer Wilds.
[36741.54s -> 36744.38s]  It was a very, very nice game.
[36744.38s -> 36746.38s]  So good in fact that it was an 89.
[36746.38s -> 36748.78s]  It was a B plus slash A minus.
[36750.17s -> 36762.40s]  That means it was very fucking good.
[36762.40s -> 36764.36s]  Don't even try it, Jeremy.
[36764.36s -> 36765.68s]  You can't do that.
[36771.22s -> 36773.54s]  What would you give Simpsons hit and run?
[36773.54s -> 36774.90s]  Oh, that's easy.
[36774.90s -> 36782.79s]  Probably a four or five.
[36782.79s -> 36792.61s]  Somewhere like a 4.8 out of 100.
[36792.61s -> 36793.45s]  No, out of 10.
[36794.73s -> 36798.15s]  No, 48 out of 100.
[36805.17s -> 36806.77s]  Ooh, the vibrations.
[36808.74s -> 36811.40s]  You guys are killing me.
[36811.40s -> 36813.68s]  What would I give Jump King?
[36813.68s -> 36817.19s]  I don't think you can even rate Jump King.
[36817.19s -> 36819.99s]  Jump King is like going and riding a ride at Disneyland.
[36819.99s -> 36821.03s]  You know what I mean?
[36821.03s -> 36829.28s]  It's not like I feel like I can't even rate that game.
[36829.28s -> 36831.00s]  Like you ride a ride at Disney and you're like,
[36831.00s -> 36832.68s]  oh, I've rid that ride.
[36832.96s -> 36837.07s]  I guess cool.
[36837.07s -> 36838.75s]  I can't score that game.
[36838.75s -> 36840.87s]  You just jump into walls and scream.
[36840.87s -> 36847.85s]  Like I can't even score it.
[36847.85s -> 36849.25s]  That was an experience.
[36849.25s -> 36851.65s]  It wasn't really a video game that I'm going to play.
[36851.65s -> 36857.04s]  I experienced that game.
[36857.04s -> 36858.80s]  I wouldn't even call it a video game.
[36858.80s -> 36860.44s]  I would call it just like a simulation
[36860.44s -> 36862.00s]  for your brain to get angry.
[36862.00s -> 36864.12s]  It's not even a game.
[36864.12s -> 36865.20s]  What would I give Mario Tennis?
[36865.20s -> 36883.66s]  A six.
[36883.66s -> 36891.50s]  What do I give Cuphead?
[36891.50s -> 36905.64s]  87, too short.
[36905.64s -> 36911.96s]  Kana zero.
[36911.96s -> 36921.84s]  70, 80, no.
[36921.84s -> 36926.80s]  79, too short.
[36926.80s -> 36933.96s]  Any more?
[36933.96s -> 36936.21s]  No more heroes.
[36936.21s -> 36945.60s]  No more heroes on Wii or no more heroes the way I played it.
[36945.60s -> 36947.52s]  The way I played it on both.
[36947.52s -> 36952.92s]  A Wii, it's like a seven one or like a six eight
[36952.92s -> 36956.46s]  because the game runs like shit.
[36956.46s -> 36961.46s]  It's like a solid like 78 or like 79 the way that I played it.
[36966.87s -> 36967.91s]  I would give it, I would give it up now.
[36967.91s -> 36968.87s]  No, it deserves an 80.
[36968.87s -> 36969.71s]  It does.
[36969.71s -> 36973.89s]  It deserves like an 80s flat, just like a B minus.
[36973.89s -> 36976.80s]  Nancy Drew.
[36976.80s -> 36977.64s]  All right, we're done.
[36977.64s -> 36978.48s]  We're not doing this anymore.
[36978.48s -> 36981.11s]  I'm going, I'm going to leave.
[36981.11s -> 36989.36s]  But if I had to give Nancy Drew a score, 95, 94?
[36989.36s -> 36991.77s]  Yeah, 94.
[36991.77s -> 36993.75s]  And then, okay, good night.
[36993.75s -> 36996.59s]  All the Drew crew, good night.
[36996.59s -> 37002.63s]  We'll see you later.
[37002.63s -> 37004.43s]  Okay, now that they probably clicked the X
[37004.43s -> 37006.55s]  because a lot of them just definitely were leaving.
[37006.55s -> 37008.11s]  It's like a six.
[37008.11s -> 37024.72s]  No, it's like a four and a half.
[37024.72s -> 37026.64s]  We got to keep the Drew crew going though.
[37026.64s -> 37028.36s]  We can't just tell them that there's the game
[37028.36s -> 37033.61s]  that they love is a six.
[37033.61s -> 37037.14s]  Although, yes, you can.
[37038.10s -> 37040.14s]  Yes, you can, Jeremy.
[37041.28s -> 37042.80s]  I do it all the time.
[37047.55s -> 37049.52s]  Rating stuff.
[37049.52s -> 37053.04s]  I give it a nine.
[37053.04s -> 37054.72s]  All right, let's do the bits.
[37054.72s -> 37058.03s]  See you tomorrow for Tony Hawk if you're leaving.
[37058.03s -> 37062.11s]  Let's get through this.
[37062.11s -> 37064.43s]  Bob Boy, thanks for the 1500 bits.
[37064.43s -> 37065.27s]  Thank you, Bob Boy.
[37065.27s -> 37068.31s]  Half-Life series free until the release of Half-Life Alex.
[37068.31s -> 37070.75s]  And you claim to play Half-Life Alex the day it comes out.
[37070.75s -> 37072.67s]  Plus the developers of Half-Life Alex
[37072.67s -> 37074.75s]  recommending you play Half-Life series
[37074.75s -> 37075.63s]  to get a grip on the story.
[37075.63s -> 37076.95s]  Will you play the Half-Life series?
[37076.95s -> 37084.20s]  I've played Half-Life one already.
[37084.20s -> 37085.12s]  I've played Half-Life two.
[37085.12s -> 37088.32s]  I know the story.
[37088.32s -> 37100.55s]  I already know this stuff.
[37100.55s -> 37103.71s]  Tell us the story.
[37103.71s -> 37106.47s]  No, I'm not gonna rifle off all the story beats
[37106.47s -> 37107.67s]  for Half-Life one and two.
[37107.67s -> 37116.33s]  Somebody might not have played it yet.
[37116.33s -> 37117.92s]  Doesn't know.
[37117.96s -> 37120.52s]  You're a scientist and you push a crystal into,
[37120.52s -> 37124.20s]  you're working on a project.
[37124.20s -> 37126.40s]  You're a scientist working on a project
[37126.40s -> 37130.20s]  and you're trying to reach to find out as much as you can
[37130.20s -> 37131.92s]  because you're curious.
[37131.92s -> 37136.07s]  And something about the sun is gonna explode.
[37136.07s -> 37137.55s]  The sun is gonna explode.
[37137.55s -> 37140.84s]  In Half-Life, that's what they know for certain.
[37140.84s -> 37143.04s]  So Gordon and a few others get together
[37143.04s -> 37143.88s]  and they try to figure out a way
[37143.88s -> 37149.55s]  to make the supernova not happen.
[37149.55s -> 37151.53s]  They end up dying.
[37151.53s -> 37155.57s]  And then you play as the gameplay character
[37155.57s -> 37158.16s]  who they named the G-Man.
[37158.16s -> 37159.68s]  You walk around, you get a stick,
[37159.68s -> 37161.28s]  you get a red crowbar.
[37161.28s -> 37168.80s]  It's a great, it's a really great game.
[37168.80s -> 37169.68s]  And then there are these bugs
[37169.68s -> 37172.32s]  that fucking drink your brain and shit.
[37172.32s -> 37174.28s]  I know what they are.
[37174.28s -> 37175.12s]  They called, what are they called?
[37175.12s -> 37179.34s]  The ambassadors or something.
[37179.34s -> 37194.98s]  They, I know what I'm talking about.
[37194.98s -> 37200.31s]  What a great story.
[37200.31s -> 37202.99s]  Dude, just like, just explain the story to me.
[37202.99s -> 37205.15s]  All right, let's keep going.
[37205.15s -> 37206.83s]  No, I'm not gonna play Half-Life on stream.
[37206.83s -> 37207.67s]  I'm not gonna do it.
[37207.67s -> 37208.51s]  I'm not gonna do it.
[37208.51s -> 37209.35s]  I'm not gonna do it.
[37209.35s -> 37210.39s]  LMMan, thanks for the thousand bits.
[37210.39s -> 37217.10s]  Dermot, you are the son of sons.
[37217.10s -> 37217.94s]  Thank you.
[37217.94s -> 37219.72s]  Thanks for the thousand bits.
[37219.72s -> 37221.80s]  LMMan again, Dermot, you're the best.
[37221.80s -> 37222.96s]  You're the only streamer I donate to.
[37222.96s -> 37224.36s]  I hope these bits will feed your rats.
[37224.36s -> 37228.46s]  Thanks for the 500 bits and the thousand bits.
[37228.46s -> 37233.09s]  I will feed my rats that I eventually might own.
[37233.09s -> 37233.93s]  Thank you though.
[37233.93s -> 37235.13s]  Thank you SuperBruce for the five community subs
[37235.13s -> 37236.97s]  fitting 300 bits.
[37236.97s -> 37238.45s]  I just remembered you said you were gonna rename
[37238.45s -> 37241.01s]  phylactery lich to phylactery 50.
[37241.01s -> 37248.61s]  How the fuck did you not think of phylactery rich?
[37248.61s -> 37251.12s]  That's pretty good too.
[37251.12s -> 37256.09s]  That's also pretty good too.
[37256.09s -> 37259.48s]  Attack of the Hank, thanks for five subs.
[37259.48s -> 37263.44s]  Daddy Umbra gave 350 plus dollars tonight in bits.
[37263.44s -> 37264.52s]  35,000 bits.
[37264.52s -> 37265.36s]  Thank you, Daddy Umbra.
[37265.36s -> 37269.98s]  Ridiculous, insane amounts of money.
[37269.98s -> 37271.22s]  Kazzy, five community subs.
[37271.22s -> 37274.53s]  Thank you, Kazzy.
[37274.53s -> 37275.81s]  Taylix, thanks for the 500 bits.
[37275.81s -> 37277.13s]  I dropped out of college a few months ago
[37277.13s -> 37278.33s]  and I feel like shit.
[37278.33s -> 37280.45s]  Can I get some words of encouragement?
[37280.45s -> 37282.73s]  He is the founder of this game's development team.
[37283.49s -> 37287.09s]  Masioka was an actor for the TV show Heroes.
[37287.09s -> 37292.10s]  It's fucking awesome.
[37292.10s -> 37298.28s]  Well, the only thing I can really say to you is
[37298.28s -> 37301.21s]  college is not for everybody.
[37301.21s -> 37304.84s]  And hopefully, it seems that you may have
[37304.84s -> 37306.76s]  figured out that already.
[37306.76s -> 37311.96s]  But you don't necessarily have to.
[37311.96s -> 37314.03s]  You don't have to do that.
[37314.03s -> 37315.43s]  And I know a lot of people think that college
[37315.43s -> 37316.99s]  is kind of like the end of the world,
[37316.99s -> 37319.75s]  like the end all be all, like you have to do this.
[37319.75s -> 37321.35s]  But there's a lot of different things you can try.
[37321.35s -> 37322.95s]  You can do trades.
[37322.95s -> 37323.79s]  You can...
[37325.71s -> 37328.47s]  I know like some people study foreign languages
[37328.47s -> 37330.59s]  and they teach, they teach English.
[37330.59s -> 37335.11s]  You can do that.
[37335.11s -> 37339.08s]  Trades pay a lot of fucking money.
[37339.08s -> 37340.44s]  They really do.
[37340.44s -> 37342.48s]  Some of my closest friends in my whole life
[37342.48s -> 37343.94s]  are in the trades.
[37343.94s -> 37353.14s]  And they do really, really, really fucking well.
[37353.14s -> 37355.02s]  So I really hope you don't think that
[37355.02s -> 37357.86s]  potentially being out of college is
[37358.54s -> 37362.90s]  something that should be a huge, huge, huge problem.
[37362.90s -> 37363.86s]  It's just not for everybody.
[37363.86s -> 37378.39s]  It just isn't.
[37378.39s -> 37379.79s]  Go to streamer school.
[37380.83s -> 37387.03s]  Well, that's not real.
[37387.03s -> 37390.51s]  Yeah, it's about finding something that works for you.
[37390.51s -> 37393.11s]  Find something that works for you.
[37393.11s -> 37395.31s]  You might not need to go to school for it.
[37395.31s -> 37399.69s]  Well, I mean, a typical four year college.
[37399.69s -> 37401.21s]  So I wouldn't worry too much about it.
[37401.21s -> 37405.00s]  Plus, you can always try again later.
[37405.00s -> 37407.12s]  If you really want to study something in college,
[37407.12s -> 37410.52s]  you can try it again another time.
[37410.52s -> 37413.04s]  I don't know how old you are, but if you're still young,
[37413.04s -> 37414.04s]  some people, it doesn't matter.
[37414.04s -> 37416.84s]  Some people go to college in their 30s.
[37416.84s -> 37418.28s]  And that's fine.
[37418.28s -> 37426.24s]  That's all right.
[37426.24s -> 37429.68s]  I wish you the best though.
[37429.68s -> 37432.87s]  Thanks for the 500 bits.
[37432.87s -> 37434.23s]  If you're a raw host, thanks for the 500 bits.
[37434.23s -> 37435.67s]  Hey German, I just want to thank you for being there for me.
[37435.67s -> 37438.99s]  I've been watching you for over seven years now.
[37438.99s -> 37441.07s]  Since then I finished two schools,
[37441.07s -> 37445.12s]  got through a lot of stuff and with all your help.
[37445.12s -> 37447.52s]  Right now I'm being challenged more than ever.
[37447.56s -> 37450.20s]  So here I am seeking happiness with you.
[37450.20s -> 37454.38s]  Thank you for everything you have done for me over the years.
[37454.38s -> 37458.17s]  It's a very long time to be watching this channel.
[37458.17s -> 37460.81s]  I sometimes I assume people will watch it
[37460.81s -> 37463.17s]  and kind of get bored after a few months or like a year
[37463.17s -> 37465.53s]  and then be like, all right, that was cool for a while.
[37465.53s -> 37466.57s]  But some of you guys have stuck around
[37466.57s -> 37469.17s]  for a insanely long time,
[37469.17s -> 37472.61s]  almost 10 years for a lot of you guys.
[37472.61s -> 37473.85s]  And that's crazy.
[37473.85s -> 37475.69s]  I'm shocked, I'm happy.
[37475.69s -> 37479.61s]  And I can't even tell you how I'm glad you still think
[37479.77s -> 37486.60s]  this is a fun place to still be.
[37486.60s -> 37488.12s]  And any of your challenges going on right now,
[37488.12s -> 37493.28s]  Veraus, I hope you get through them.
[37493.28s -> 37500.16s]  Take it slow, stay focused, and do you.
[37500.16s -> 37501.12s]  Help, I'm stuck here.
[37501.12s -> 37506.18s]  Don't worry, I'll take care of that.
[37506.18s -> 37510.42s]  Unmod, demod, purge, ban, remove founder.
[37519.47s -> 37521.81s]  Can I be a mod?
[37521.81s -> 37523.37s]  Nah, sorry.
[37525.76s -> 37528.04s]  We also had Squishington, thanks for the 300 bits.
[37528.04s -> 37529.68s]  Love you, German, thanks for always making my day better.
[37529.68s -> 37530.72s]  Thanks for making my day better
[37530.72s -> 37533.32s]  because you hanging out here allows me
[37533.32s -> 37535.24s]  to continue to do this and allows me
[37535.24s -> 37538.40s]  to make enough monetary compensation
[37538.40s -> 37542.80s]  to do something like this for a living, which is ridiculous.
[37542.80s -> 37547.59s]  So thank you for sitting here and watching this
[37547.59s -> 37555.56s]  because you're making my day better, immensely.
[37555.56s -> 37557.32s]  He's in it for the fucking money.
[37559.60s -> 37560.44s]  That's true.
[37561.48s -> 37567.38s]  Without people watching, without people here,
[37567.38s -> 37569.34s]  and I don't know, I don't, who knows how long
[37569.34s -> 37573.87s]  I would have been able to do it.
[37573.87s -> 37576.39s]  Remember, I'm starting to get a little older
[37576.39s -> 37578.23s]  and I'm not so sure, you know,
[37578.23s -> 37582.28s]  let's say rewind the clock 10 years.
[37582.28s -> 37585.00s]  If my YouTube channel didn't really start gaining viewership
[37585.00s -> 37588.36s]  when it did, I'm not sure I would have spent
[37588.36s -> 37591.77s]  too much more time on it.
[37591.77s -> 37593.09s]  Maybe after like a couple of years,
[37593.09s -> 37594.73s]  like two or three, four years, maybe it'd be like,
[37594.73s -> 37596.85s]  all right, I'm getting, I'm starting to be,
[37596.85s -> 37600.19s]  I'm gonna be 30, so I'm gonna try to figure something out.
[37600.19s -> 37601.03s]  You know what I'm saying?
[37601.03s -> 37602.19s]  So people being here, people watching,
[37602.23s -> 37605.95s]  and the views and the subscriptions on YouTube, I mean,
[37605.95s -> 37609.49s]  and into Twitch, that's,
[37609.49s -> 37611.89s]  you've allowed me to continue to do this.
[37611.89s -> 37619.01s]  You've allowed me to make fun what I do for work.
[37619.01s -> 37619.89s]  You know what I mean?
[37619.89s -> 37622.61s]  Trying to just have as much fun as I can
[37622.61s -> 37625.09s]  with as many people as possible.
[37625.09s -> 37629.77s]  You've done, that's what you have done.
[37629.77s -> 37647.88s]  Don't ever forget that.
[37647.88s -> 37650.64s]  It's like I said, the closer that I was moving
[37650.64s -> 37652.88s]  into like my early 30s, it's, you know,
[37652.92s -> 37656.12s]  I'm like, all right, what do I wanna do now?
[37656.12s -> 37657.92s]  And that still might happen.
[37657.92s -> 37659.04s]  I don't have a crystal ball.
[37659.04s -> 37664.39s]  I don't know how long Twitch and being
[37664.43s -> 37668.25s]  an online content creator or in quotes,
[37668.25s -> 37672.41s]  an online entertainment influencer in any quote.
[37672.41s -> 37673.25s]  I don't know.
[37673.25s -> 37674.73s]  I don't know what the future holds.
[37674.73s -> 37677.29s]  So I'm trying to keep an open mind about it
[37677.29s -> 37682.87s]  and just kind of go with the flow and see what happens.
[37682.91s -> 37687.37s]  Somebody was saying, hey, about the college thing.
[37687.37s -> 37690.15s]  Like Taylix said about the college thing.
[37690.15s -> 37692.95s]  I mean, I might be in my early 40s and be like,
[37692.95s -> 37697.65s]  all right, now what am I doing now?
[37697.65s -> 37701.52s]  You got plenty of time.
[37701.52s -> 37706.86s]  Produces, I screwed up your name again.
[37706.86s -> 37710.09s]  And I'm probably gonna get corrected for it.
[37710.09s -> 37713.41s]  But it was Produces Asen and I know it's wrong.
[37713.41s -> 37714.57s]  I already know it's wrong.
[37714.57s -> 37719.62s]  Thanks for the six community subs a little earlier.
[37719.62s -> 37723.62s]  Hawkwing, thanks for 500 bits, Producesen, there it is.
[37726.13s -> 37727.45s]  Thank you Hawkwing for the 500 bits.
[37727.45s -> 37728.53s]  Jerma, why do you hate this game?
[37728.53s -> 37729.89s]  It makes me sad, it's my favorite game.
[37729.89s -> 37730.73s]  Why do you hate me?
[37730.73s -> 37733.56s]  What?
[37733.56s -> 37734.64s]  Jerma, why do you hate this game?
[37734.64s -> 37736.08s]  It makes me sad, it's my favorite game.
[37736.08s -> 37740.09s]  Why do you hate me?
[37740.09s -> 37744.11s]  When did I say I hate this game?
[37744.11s -> 37756.92s]  I just gave it an 89.
[37756.92s -> 37758.72s]  That's a hater grade.
[37758.72s -> 37760.12s]  Wait, hold on.
[37760.12s -> 37763.20s]  Am I under the assumption that any game that's under a 90
[37763.20s -> 37764.96s]  is a game that the person hated?
[37768.52s -> 37774.04s]  Isn't that reserved for a three?
[37774.04s -> 37777.62s]  I would give The Surge a three.
[37777.62s -> 37783.48s]  I would give, I mean, that's,
[37783.48s -> 37797.31s]  so you're talking about going from a three to an 8.9.
[37797.31s -> 37799.27s]  Giving The Surge a three is generous.
[37809.04s -> 37810.52s]  Future Gamer, thanks for the 250.
[37810.52s -> 37812.60s]  Will you also be doing the Get Well Soon card
[37812.60s -> 37814.16s]  during the Diablo stream?
[37814.16s -> 37818.40s]  I talked about it earlier, yesterday I think,
[37818.40s -> 37819.48s]  and in the pre-stream chat as well,
[37819.48s -> 37823.18s]  but I'm gonna do the card alone.
[37823.18s -> 37824.82s]  I'd rather experience that by myself.
[37824.82s -> 37833.02s]  I feel like that's more appropriate for me.
[37833.06s -> 37840.61s]  It lets me sit there and take it in by myself.
[37840.61s -> 37845.20s]  So I will not be doing it on stream.
[37845.20s -> 37846.24s]  Almost midnight Pacific.
[37846.24s -> 37847.20s]  Yeah, I mean, this is a long one.
[37847.20s -> 37849.87s]  I knew I wanted to get it done tonight.
[37849.87s -> 37856.74s]  We'll be back tomorrow afternoon, Tony Hawk.
[37856.74s -> 37858.02s]  Dark Soul, thanks for the 250.
[37858.02s -> 37861.06s]  Any anticipated VR stuff or is that still off the table?
[37861.06s -> 37864.54s]  I also now get why you only did four to five hour streams
[37864.54s -> 37867.02s]  because boy, does this motion sickness just lie inside you
[37867.02s -> 37868.20s]  and come on instantly.
[37869.85s -> 37874.30s]  Yeah, being in that VR headset
[37874.30s -> 37883.18s]  and broadcasting is, it just, it takes a lot out of you.
[37883.54s -> 37885.55s]  Any VR stuff?
[37885.55s -> 37887.64s]  Kinda, yeah.
[37887.64s -> 37892.88s]  Besides Half-Life Alex, obviously.
[37892.88s -> 37894.56s]  It's not that Walking Dead game came out.
[37894.56s -> 37895.60s]  It kinda looks cool.
[37897.48s -> 37899.32s]  Boneworks looks awesome.
[37899.32s -> 37904.46s]  I really wanna play it.
[37904.46s -> 37905.94s]  There's at least two or three titles that I know
[37905.94s -> 37910.25s]  that I wanna play.
[37910.25s -> 37912.81s]  Tarisov, thanks for the 400 bits.
[37912.81s -> 37916.19s]  Appreciate it.
[37916.19s -> 37919.22s]  Let's get the credits rolling.
[37919.22s -> 37924.82s]  We're nearing the end here.
[37924.82s -> 37935.87s]  We'll bump you, just make sure.
[37935.87s -> 37945.26s]  We hand that guy.
[37945.26s -> 37946.78s]  Hold on, let me just get it on the screen.
[37946.78s -> 37947.78s]  It should be there.
[37949.26s -> 37951.78s]  In three, two, one.
[37955.01s -> 37956.73s]  There it is.
[37956.73s -> 37959.31s]  Thanks to all the subs.
[37959.31s -> 37967.22s]  The oil that continues to move the machine.
[37967.22s -> 37969.62s]  Appreciate it.
[37969.62s -> 37972.68s]  Thank you guys for letting me do what I do.
[37976.58s -> 37979.74s]  I know maybe not every stream is your favorite.
[37979.74s -> 37984.56s]  Maybe not every stream is my favorite, right?
[37984.56s -> 37986.16s]  Some streams are my favorite thing in the world.
[37986.16s -> 37988.98s]  Some streams are your favorite things in the world.
[37988.98s -> 37994.04s]  But at the end of the day, thanks for letting me do this.
[37994.04s -> 37995.24s]  No, not this one.
[37995.24s -> 37996.16s]  Not this one.
[37996.16s -> 37997.32s]  This was fun.
[37997.32s -> 37998.32s]  These last two streams,
[37998.32s -> 38001.20s]  I've had a lot of fun playing this fucking game.
[38001.20s -> 38002.92s]  I'm just saying in general.
[38002.92s -> 38003.76s]  In general.
[38008.50s -> 38010.76s]  We have a game in 89.
[38010.76s -> 38020.82s]  But all of a sudden, he's talking about Asura's wrath.
[38024.70s -> 38028.19s]  God damn it.
[38028.19s -> 38029.59s]  All right, let me be real with you.
[38029.59s -> 38031.15s]  This is the end of the stream.
[38031.15s -> 38032.75s]  Half the audience is gone.
[38032.75s -> 38034.43s]  Let me just be real with you guys.
[38034.43s -> 38036.31s]  People fucking did not like that game.
[38037.35s -> 38039.27s]  Can we be completely real here?
[38039.27s -> 38042.69s]  People were not happy that I was playing that game.
[38042.69s -> 38053.57s]  People were like, like losing their minds.
[38053.57s -> 38057.83s]  But we're probably gonna finish it.
[38057.83s -> 38072.22s]  If this time after Diablo II, I'm gonna try to play it.
[38072.22s -> 38075.18s]  So again, you know, some of your streams
[38075.18s -> 38078.18s]  might not be your favorite streams or your favorite games.
[38078.18s -> 38080.22s]  But thanks for continuing to come back
[38080.22s -> 38082.18s]  and continuing to talk and continuing to hang out
[38082.18s -> 38084.93s]  and still having fun as I am.
[38087.83s -> 38090.63s]  We had a box box raid earlier for a shitload of people.
[38090.63s -> 38091.71s]  I don't know if you're still here.
[38091.71s -> 38094.82s]  Some of you guys might still be here.
[38094.82s -> 38097.35s]  Thanks box box.
[38097.35s -> 38098.27s]  You're awesome.
[38098.27s -> 38104.03s]  Thank you.
[38104.03s -> 38106.58s]  Really appreciate that.
[38106.58s -> 38110.09s]  Big Applewood, 500 bits.
[38110.09s -> 38112.39s]  No message.
[38112.39s -> 38115.15s]  A Skedongler gave a thousand bits, $10.
[38115.15s -> 38116.71s]  Today we were all told to write down the name
[38116.71s -> 38118.39s]  of someone who we look up to
[38118.39s -> 38120.83s]  and put it up on the board at my school.
[38120.83s -> 38122.07s]  I racked my brain for a while
[38122.07s -> 38124.55s]  and you always ended up on the top of my list.
[38124.59s -> 38126.79s]  We were then told to find a way to thank that person.
[38126.79s -> 38128.43s]  So here I am.
[38128.43s -> 38131.95s]  I honestly think you're the most selfless human being.
[38131.95s -> 38133.91s]  I want to grow up to be as humble and kind as you.
[38133.91s -> 38135.15s]  You're such an inspiring dude.
[38135.15s -> 38136.66s]  Hope you know.
[38136.66s -> 38138.54s]  Love you, Jare Bear.
[38138.54s -> 38145.30s]  We tease you because we love you.
[38145.30s -> 38147.50s]  That's something I never thought I would ever hear
[38147.50s -> 38153.11s]  anybody say when I was, you know, like 16.
[38153.11s -> 38157.56s]  Knowing that that happened is just,
[38157.56s -> 38160.28s]  I hope you being influenced positively.
[38160.28s -> 38166.81s]  Regardless of talking shit, fucking around, making jokes.
[38166.81s -> 38170.66s]  However you view these streams,
[38170.66s -> 38173.70s]  I really hope that you take something good from here.
[38173.70s -> 38177.46s]  Something.
[38177.46s -> 38180.10s]  And not everything has to be super duper positive
[38180.10s -> 38182.94s]  and perfect and fantastic and oh my God, it's so good.
[38182.94s -> 38185.19s]  Everything's perfect, everything's positive.
[38185.19s -> 38186.03s]  But at the end of the day,
[38186.03s -> 38187.75s]  I really hope you look back on this and you go like,
[38187.75s -> 38190.39s]  oh, that was like actually a really kind of fun time.
[38193.47s -> 38195.39s]  I met some people, met some friends.
[38195.39s -> 38196.51s]  It was a place to hang out.
[38196.51s -> 38200.87s]  It was something to watch, something to think was fun, right?
[38200.87s -> 38204.21s]  Like I hope at the end of the day, you do think that.
[38204.21s -> 38205.85s]  I never want to be somebody you look back on
[38205.85s -> 38208.25s]  and be like, yeah, that sucked.
[38208.25s -> 38209.25s]  That guy sucks.
[38209.25s -> 38211.91s]  That community was dumb.
[38211.91s -> 38214.31s]  So I'm happy that people are not doing that.
[38214.31s -> 38221.05s]  And they're sharing stories like this.
[38221.05s -> 38225.40s]  Thank you so much for the $10.
[38225.40s -> 38233.68s]  Means a lot, it really does.
[38233.68s -> 38236.24s]  Hey, Greco Twitch, thanks for a thousand bits.
[38236.24s -> 38237.68s]  No message, just a thousand bits.
[38237.72s -> 38244.63s]  Just $10 deposited into my twitch.tv bank account.
[38244.63s -> 38246.27s]  Bonjour Tristan, thanks for the 500 bits.
[38246.27s -> 38247.67s]  Hey Jerma, I just wanted to share an idea.
[38247.67s -> 38250.59s]  I often watch your streams and VODs while cooking.
[38250.59s -> 38251.43s]  I'm thinking it'd be funny
[38251.43s -> 38253.91s]  if you did a follow along cooking vid
[38253.91s -> 38255.43s]  for a really hard dish.
[38255.43s -> 38257.03s]  Then we could all share our results together
[38257.03s -> 38258.75s]  in the sub or something.
[38258.75s -> 38261.31s]  Anyways, just a thought and thanks for the streams.
[38264.61s -> 38266.89s]  Whenever I watch your videos, I pog my pants.
[38266.89s -> 38271.50s]  Oh, that's, thank you.
[38271.50s -> 38274.14s]  There's cooking stuff that's starting to be worked on.
[38274.74s -> 38276.22s]  It's just kind of weird.
[38277.62s -> 38284.42s]  We'll see.
[38284.42s -> 38286.06s]  Zero giblets, thanks for the 500 bits.
[38286.06s -> 38288.02s]  Hey Jerma, I haven't given anything in a while,
[38288.02s -> 38290.22s]  so I figured I should show some love.
[38290.22s -> 38291.06s]  Keep on keeping on.
[38291.06s -> 38293.02s]  Oh, and when you address my message in chat,
[38293.02s -> 38294.62s]  among the many others,
[38294.62s -> 38296.42s]  it's like the lucky maiden in the crowd
[38296.42s -> 38298.10s]  whose favor the night chooses.
[38298.10s -> 38307.08s]  Thanks.
[38307.08s -> 38308.34s]  Thank you.
[38308.34s -> 38310.58s]  I appreciate it.
[38310.58s -> 38312.26s]  Hey Gondolaine, thanks for the 250.
[38312.26s -> 38313.58s]  Hey Jerbo, it's been a year
[38313.58s -> 38316.34s]  since your famous 700,000 game stream.
[38316.42s -> 38318.82s]  I think it's about time you give us a prequel stream,
[38318.82s -> 38321.51s]  where you stream the games that started it all.
[38321.51s -> 38323.87s]  These are a collection of really shitty games
[38323.87s -> 38326.27s]  and these are unique,
[38326.27s -> 38329.95s]  unlike the 700,000 games by Viva Media.
[38329.95s -> 38334.30s]  It'd be worthy for a fuckface shovelware stream.
[38334.30s -> 38338.38s]  This is called 555 Games, XP Championship Edition.
[38342.23s -> 38343.87s]  All right, fine, yeah, I'll buy it.
[38343.87s -> 38345.88s]  I'll buy it right now.
[38345.88s -> 38351.36s]  All right, yeah, sounds good.
[38351.36s -> 38355.21s]  Hopefully there's a super frog in it.
[38355.21s -> 38359.20s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow for Tony Hawk.
[38359.20s -> 38361.12s]  Take care, buddy.
[38361.12s -> 38362.68s]  Two more bits to do.
[38362.68s -> 38364.40s]  I know it's another late one.
[38364.40s -> 38366.64s]  We've done a few late long streams this week,
[38366.64s -> 38368.32s]  but remember, I'm not gonna be here
[38368.32s -> 38371.08s]  for almost a full week next week.
[38371.08s -> 38374.92s]  So I'm happy to do four or five
[38374.92s -> 38376.52s]  of these long streams in a row.
[38378.73s -> 38380.57s]  Cornflake, thanks for the 500 bits.
[38380.57s -> 38382.37s]  Small brain streamer, you just don't get it.
[38382.37s -> 38383.21s]  I get it.
[38383.21s -> 38386.61s]  I have read countless explanations on Reddit.
[38386.61s -> 38390.41s]  I am, that's it, they trailed off.
[38390.41s -> 38393.17s]  There's nothing there.
[38393.17s -> 38394.89s]  Hey, all the chemists, thanks for the 500 bits.
[38394.89s -> 38397.13s]  I dare you to read the Reddit summary on stream.
[38397.13s -> 38398.41s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[38398.41s -> 38399.69s]  Somebody might have clicked on the stream
[38399.69s -> 38402.41s]  and not played the game and they just get like a TLDR
[38402.41s -> 38403.81s]  and the whole game's ruined.
[38406.15s -> 38409.15s]  Cap'n spurt dick, thanks for the 500 bits.
[38409.15s -> 38412.83s]  I said the dick part of that, so emphasized.
[38412.83s -> 38414.55s]  It's been almost 11 hours.
[38414.55s -> 38416.79s]  Give me just a little slack.
[38416.79s -> 38420.32s]  They just say Jeremy.
[38421.04s -> 38422.12s]  Jeremy who?
[38422.12s -> 38423.12s]  Jeremy me?
[38423.12s -> 38425.32s]  Or Jeremy you?
[38425.32s -> 38429.12s]  See you guys tomorrow, have a good night.
[38429.12s -> 38434.66s]  Tony Hawk's Underground tomorrow, have a good night.
