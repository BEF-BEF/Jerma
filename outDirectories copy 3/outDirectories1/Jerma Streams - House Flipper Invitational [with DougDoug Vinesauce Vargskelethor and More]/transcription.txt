[26.87s -> 40.65s]  Hello everybody. I already have my chat open. Hold on, let me do that. We fix that. That is a useful
[40.65s -> 53.69s]  thing to have open. Welcome to the House Flipper Unofficial Invitational. How you doing? Give me
[53.69s -> 66.73s]  one second while I do this. There are 10 people here. It's weird to talk in chat and not be in chat.
[66.73s -> 91.64s]  Hold on. Give me one. I didn't even. I gotta tweet it. I gotta tweet it. Give me a second. The House
[91.64s -> 100.54s]  Flipper Unofficial Invitational. No, this is unofficial. This is only my Invitational.
[100.54s -> 105.66s]  If you're wondering, I asked a bunch of my friends, a couple other streamer colleagues
[106.22s -> 112.41s]  to come into the stream, spend 75 minutes at the same time with the same house,
[113.13s -> 123.98s]  and see who makes the best house. Graded on five categories. Well, four categories. You guys will
[123.98s -> 133.48s]  get the last grade. Everybody should be getting started with their streams. We want to make sure
[133.48s -> 142.30s]  everyone's ready to go. All right, here we go. Who's here? We will. We will introduce them in
[142.30s -> 150.10s]  just one second. How much time do they get? 75 minutes. Are you playing Final Fantasy today?
[150.10s -> 160.01s]  What? Not today. Yeah, we're gonna play Final Fantasy in five minutes. No.
[162.97s -> 172.38s]  All right, I think we can get the crew here. Let's see if everybody's here. Hello? Is anybody here?
[174.49s -> 183.61s]  Hello, Mr. J. Well, that's a mod. All right. Is everybody here? I'm live right now. So if
[183.61s -> 193.72s]  anybody wants to pop in. Hello. Hi. Yeah, we got, we got mods in here. Everybody unmute.
[194.82s -> 202.46s]  Yeah. Yeah. Hello. How is it going, folks? What's up? Should I ping the other streamers to unmute?
[203.18s -> 213.35s]  I would say so. And it's 75 minutes. Starts right now. Wait, really? No, no, no, no. I'm just
[213.35s -> 222.26s]  kidding. I'm kidding. Oh, that's right. That's right. That's right. All right. Once everybody's
[222.26s -> 228.47s]  here. Yeah, you can unmute. You can undefine everything. We're going to go over it real
[228.47s -> 232.55s]  quickly. And I'm very curious. I want to get a little bit of a temperature check from all of you.
[233.19s -> 239.11s]  We're going to introduce every single person. Each person gets each person gets 15 minutes to
[239.11s -> 243.75s]  introduce themselves. Should take us about two or three hours to get through the initial intros
[243.75s -> 255.29s]  here. Cool. Glad I have this full PowerPoint presentation. You to me. All right. So welcome,
[256.09s -> 262.26s]  ladies and gentlemen, to the house flipper of unofficial invitational. What you see on
[262.26s -> 267.82s]  my screen right now is the house that all of these streamers are going to have to turn into
[267.82s -> 275.58s]  a beautiful home in 75 minutes. The timer is on my stream. I would be aware that streamers,
[275.58s -> 281.26s]  if you need to know, it's 75 minutes, hour and 15 from when I count down. Well, let's introduce
[281.26s -> 285.46s]  who's here first. And by the way, you get literally like a five second introduction.
[285.46s -> 294.66s]  So let's start. Whoever wants to go first. Go ahead. Just go. I'm Vinny. Hi. That's all I need.
[295.54s -> 299.46s]  He got it. Well, I was I thought we were going to hear a shit load of people just start yelling.
[299.46s -> 303.64s]  Does he get points for that? Does he get graded? Hmm. Yep. I think so.
[303.64s -> 308.10s]  That was some good philosophy. That was pretty good philosophy. That's right. Everyone's.
[312.25s -> 317.75s]  No, no. See, see, see dog. What time is it where you are right now?
[317.75s -> 324.63s]  It's well, it's 512 a.m. And I woke up at 430 a.m. For this. So I hope that goes into the kind
[324.63s -> 330.60s]  judging considerations that at an inconvenient time, I'm on peak performance.
[333.78s -> 342.02s]  Yeah. So I'll just go through it. Connery's pants. See dog. Criken. Doug Doug. It's Alex. Ludwig.
[342.02s -> 353.70s]  R.T. game. Joel. I almost just said Trotter, but you're you're a mod and Vinesauce Vinny.
[353.70s -> 360.26s]  These are your we did an alphabetical order. Yeah. Roll call attendance done for the class.
[360.42s -> 365.78s]  That's the attendance of ladies and gentlemen. And I mean, you know, for German 98. Yeah.
[368.60s -> 375.19s]  Whistler. I don't know. He's not here. He might just say he might just show up and just jump in
[375.19s -> 379.86s]  the call later. He has no pressure to be here, by the way. It's a content creator stream and
[379.86s -> 384.50s]  we're less than 15 minutes late. That is a crowning achievement. That actually is true.
[384.50s -> 389.62s]  It's true. There's the sheer fact that miracle we're all actually here at the same time is
[389.62s -> 394.74s]  quite shocking. It is. I'm just going to tell you guys this. When German presented this idea to us
[394.74s -> 399.30s]  and I'm going to go full in for this, all right, because it's going to be like my part of this
[399.30s -> 404.36s]  is going to be crap. But I get into this call and I'm expecting everybody's got their stuff lined up
[404.36s -> 411.62s]  so good. And I realize none of these guys have booted up the game. Yeah. So I have a good chance
[411.62s -> 417.54s]  of maybe making it into the bottom five. You know, you got this, Joel. I believe in you,
[417.62s -> 421.22s]  Joel. I don't know. You might be the favorite. It's possible you're the
[421.22s -> 424.98s]  fellow. I hope you crash and burn. Joel showed us his secret and it is
[424.98s -> 431.62s]  way better than anything I thought. I think we have a very. I hope you're a lecture about the walls.
[431.62s -> 438.74s]  So I don't know how to make walls. I will figure that out. He woke up. It's five a.m. He's like,
[438.74s -> 443.30s]  what the fuck does German want me to do? He wants to build a house. What are the tools?
[443.62s -> 445.94s]  Telling me about the technique, about how bad he will.
[445.94s -> 450.58s]  You're going to scroll at a good pace. Make sure you're five pixels away from the wall.
[450.58s -> 454.50s]  The ball won't build. And I'm like, wait, which tool is this? Well, I'll figure it out.
[454.50s -> 458.74s]  Yeah, it's by the way, this whole thing is horseshit. None of this matter.
[461.14s -> 465.29s]  Give it away. What? No reason to stay.
[466.73s -> 471.37s]  If you guys just all left right now, like it would be fine. Like there's no nobody wins anything.
[471.37s -> 475.61s]  Nobody loses anything except I have to ask you, Jerma. I have to ask you this.
[475.61s -> 480.50s]  This might be a stupid question, but are you wearing it like a toupee or something?
[480.50s -> 484.50s]  You look like you look like you. No, I'm not wearing a toupee.
[484.50s -> 490.02s]  Oh, this is my real fucking hair. Tony's shit. What happened?
[490.02s -> 494.42s]  Look more professional or something. This is Tony. Take points away for that.
[495.30s -> 497.94s]  Take points for copying Tony star. Thank you for bringing up points.
[497.94s -> 501.78s]  Let's go over it real quickly. You are all going to be graded individually.
[501.78s -> 503.62s]  You're going to give me a tour through what you thought?
[503.62s -> 509.19s]  You don't like my presentation voice? There's a lot of people in here who just left.
[513.13s -> 517.93s]  Is it a mod? You'll never figure out who it was with like streamer mode on.
[517.93s -> 521.77s]  OK. Sorry, Jerma. Which sea name was it? Good luck.
[523.21s -> 526.57s]  You are all going. Let me talk about what you're doing.
[528.33s -> 530.73s]  Yeah, that's an old one. That one was of 2018.
[531.85s -> 540.07s]  I mean, this is like a first trial run of this event. You guys supposed to be my friends.
[541.37s -> 542.97s]  We're listening, buddy. Go ahead.
[542.97s -> 545.69s]  I'm going to keep you going, Jerma. Yeah, everybody give it up for Jerma.
[545.69s -> 547.77s]  I'm here for you. Moment of silence for Jerma.
[547.77s -> 552.89s]  You are all going after 75 minutes, which, by the way, everybody here is streaming.
[552.89s -> 557.85s]  So everybody has their streams going. You can jump around, go see what people are doing.
[557.85s -> 560.41s]  Maybe one of them isn't. And then, you know, whatever, that's all good.
[560.41s -> 563.58s]  Well, maybe two of them aren't three. Doesn't matter. But go check it out.
[563.58s -> 565.66s]  You're going to be seeing their process. They'll be streaming it live.
[565.66s -> 568.54s]  They're all on this house and they're all going to be graded on five categories.
[568.54s -> 573.42s]  Creativity is number one. It's worth 35 percent of your total grade.
[573.42s -> 576.71s]  Creativity. Creatively bankrupt.
[576.71s -> 584.87s]  Based on a one hundred point scale, it's worth 35 percent of your total grade.
[584.87s -> 590.95s]  Complexity and structure is your second grade. This is worth 25 percent of your total grade.
[590.95s -> 594.95s]  How do you how did you handle the walls? What is your interior wall structure looks like?
[594.95s -> 597.67s]  Did you do any additions? How does your yard look?
[597.67s -> 601.43s]  Did you did you add anything in there? How does your yard look?
[601.43s -> 606.41s]  How does your yard look? The next one is cleanliness.
[606.41s -> 611.50s]  Cleanliness is worth 15. I see that over there. Somebody's put an image of me.
[611.50s -> 615.74s]  It's worth it. Cleanliness is worth 15 percent of your total grade.
[615.74s -> 618.62s]  So make sure. Look, I mean, look at this. You got this kind of dirty.
[618.62s -> 622.14s]  It's kind of fucked up. You're going to be graded on this one hundred point scale.
[622.14s -> 624.78s]  Maybe you get an F and clean. Maybe you get an A plus in creativity.
[624.78s -> 628.66s]  Use your time wisely. The next grade.
[628.66s -> 633.99s]  There's more. Philosophy is worth 15 percent of your total grade.
[633.99s -> 637.99s]  What does philosophy mean? We'll find out because I don't know either.
[637.99s -> 642.06s]  So we're going to figure that out as we go. The last grade is worth 10 percent.
[642.06s -> 648.30s]  It is chat's grade. The mods are going to put a poll in at the end of each person's individual tour.
[648.30s -> 655.75s]  That will be a very simple A, B, C, D or F. F is always 55 points.
[655.75s -> 658.87s]  You can't go lower than 55 points. Do we have any questions?
[660.42s -> 665.22s]  Have you revealed that you are going to build a real full scale replica of the winning house yet?
[667.96s -> 670.52s]  For the dollhouse, too. This is the location.
[670.52s -> 673.48s]  No, not yet. But that's that's that's a great idea.
[673.48s -> 675.24s]  That's actually a fantastic idea.
[677.05s -> 679.93s]  There's like grandmas on the left side of my screen. Is that all right?
[680.57s -> 685.53s]  OK, it escape. Go to settings. Go to gameplay options and
[685.53s -> 688.89s]  check the box that says I don't want to hear from the people, the buyers.
[689.40s -> 690.12s]  You should all do that.
[690.12s -> 692.60s]  Oh, I. Oh, wait, I think you're joking.
[692.60s -> 697.32s]  Well, they were just. OK, can I ask how many people?
[697.32s -> 701.72s]  That is funny, though, in my two page document that I sent you all four or five days ago.
[702.28s -> 703.72s]  How do you guys think I was making a joke?
[704.89s -> 709.13s]  I read I read it like I did. I read the whole thing.
[709.13s -> 711.61s]  I thought it was more like light reading, though. I thought I didn't realize it was
[712.41s -> 714.33s]  optional. I thought it was a creative writing piece.
[715.37s -> 719.35s]  I said you guys a two page document with detailed instructions.
[719.59s -> 721.51s]  It seemed like G.B.T. wrote it.
[721.51s -> 724.39s]  Oh, yeah. I thought it was like an Isaac Asimov, the foundation thing.
[724.39s -> 726.71s]  Like it didn't actually have any bearing on real life.
[726.71s -> 727.83s]  I don't understand the power.
[727.83s -> 729.67s]  We had to eat a horse in preparation.
[731.99s -> 733.19s]  I ate the horse.
[733.19s -> 735.75s]  Ladies and gentlemen, I read it so I could figure out all the loopholes.
[735.75s -> 739.32s]  Are we all ready? Oh, yes.
[741.24s -> 742.44s]  I didn't catch that.
[742.44s -> 748.57s]  I'm ready because you have seventy five minutes as of the third.
[748.57s -> 755.80s]  You're making me laugh as of three, two, one, go.
[764.68s -> 766.52s]  OK, they all muted. They can't hear me anymore.
[766.52s -> 767.80s]  I can hear you. I heard.
[767.80s -> 768.68s]  Oh, you're waiting.
[768.68s -> 769.96s]  That's not how muting works.
[769.96s -> 771.16s]  What? What happened?
[771.16s -> 772.36s]  I thought everyone was gone.
[772.36s -> 774.86s]  Oh, hi. All right.
[774.86s -> 776.94s]  Well, so they are on their own streams.
[776.94s -> 778.14s]  I'm very curious what they do.
[778.70s -> 781.66s]  In the meantime, I'm going to just kind of show you some things about house flipper
[781.66s -> 783.58s]  that, you know, we're just going to go take a look.
[783.66s -> 785.83s]  Some of you might not have ever seen this game.
[785.83s -> 786.87s]  Yeah, you should probably mute me
[786.87s -> 789.03s]  because I'm just going to be like an annoying presenter this whole time.
[792.23s -> 793.99s]  Somebody says Ludwig isn't streaming.
[796.46s -> 799.91s]  So he's cheating.
[799.91s -> 802.46s]  That's so funny.
[802.46s -> 803.90s]  But anyways, all right, let's go.
[803.90s -> 805.74s]  So I'm very curious about this.
[808.22s -> 809.66s]  This was just something to do for fun.
[810.38s -> 812.62s]  I never thought this was going to be like anything serious or anything.
[812.62s -> 815.96s]  But this is this is going to be a good time.
[815.96s -> 816.68s]  I'm very curious.
[816.68s -> 820.92s]  I could go peek in and see what they're doing, but I'm going to leave that up to you.
[820.92s -> 825.40s]  I think I think I want because I want to be very
[825.40s -> 826.12s]  surprised.
[826.12s -> 827.40s]  I don't think I want to see what they're doing.
[828.58s -> 832.26s]  I think I want to be given a fully completely secret tour
[832.26s -> 835.70s]  because then I can get my real assessment on the grades
[835.70s -> 839.46s]  because we have them here and I'm ready to give them to each individual person.
[840.39s -> 841.91s]  So let me let me do some stuff.
[841.91s -> 842.79s]  Let me let me see what I can do.
[842.79s -> 844.23s]  And I don't who cares about my time.
[844.23s -> 848.10s]  What the fuck do I care?
[848.10s -> 850.98s]  I don't want to peek.
[850.98s -> 851.62s]  So let's see.
[851.62s -> 852.66s]  What do I want to do?
[852.66s -> 855.19s]  I can just clean the yard and just hang out.
[855.19s -> 856.41s]  All right.
[856.41s -> 859.93s]  What I do want to I do want to ask this question of everybody that's streaming right now.
[859.93s -> 864.60s]  Who is panicking the most right now?
[864.60s -> 867.48s]  Right now, out of all the people that are doing this, who right now is like,
[867.48s -> 868.92s]  I don't fucking know what's going on.
[868.92s -> 874.49s]  Please somebody help me.
[874.49s -> 876.97s]  I bet you it's all of them because they have to clean.
[876.97s -> 879.45s]  Look at how fucking like dirty the yard is.
[879.45s -> 881.37s]  Hey, don't don't tell them this.
[881.37s -> 885.43s]  I'm going to want to see back here, too.
[886.95s -> 887.99s]  Don't tell them that.
[887.99s -> 891.46s]  Well, you think that's worth a 100 percent?
[891.46s -> 892.34s]  You think that's with an A plus?
[892.34s -> 899.08s]  If you miss anything here, they're stream sniping each other.
[901.83s -> 903.83s]  They really they really shouldn't be.
[903.83s -> 907.34s]  But whatever, it doesn't fucking matter.
[907.34s -> 909.96s]  I'm so curious, though.
[909.96s -> 911.32s]  I wonder what they all do.
[916.33s -> 922.26s]  They're stealing ideas from each other.
[922.26s -> 922.74s]  It's so funny.
[922.74s -> 925.88s]  I try to give the there's so many.
[925.88s -> 926.52s]  It's so funny.
[927.08s -> 931.48s]  So I had like a two page detailed document about like how things work and everything.
[932.12s -> 938.50s]  And even I'm just sitting here going, wait, how the fuck do you build an edition?
[938.50s -> 942.90s]  Oh, so like 20 minutes ago, I was in there explaining how to do an edition
[942.90s -> 945.27s]  because I was like, wait a minute, why is this not working?
[945.27s -> 945.99s]  Oh, that's right.
[945.99s -> 947.59s]  You can't have anything on the other side.
[947.59s -> 953.40s]  We were we were like troubleshooting with each other like 20 minutes ago.
[953.40s -> 955.08s]  I didn't even tweet the stream.
[955.08s -> 958.10s]  There's like 10 fucking streamers here.
[958.10s -> 963.19s]  Give me a second.
[963.19s -> 963.83s]  Hold on.
[963.83s -> 986.28s]  I'm going to say live right now with the house flipper speed build with streamers.
[992.46s -> 995.10s]  It's not really a tournament.
[995.10s -> 996.22s]  You're wasting time.
[996.22s -> 1000.74s]  I mean, the whole goal for the first hour of this stream on my end is to waste time.
[1000.74s -> 1001.86s]  So don't worry.
[1001.86s -> 1004.82s]  The timer is for you and for them to know how much time they have left.
[1004.82s -> 1005.70s]  Should I go in there?
[1006.02s -> 1012.09s]  Should I have the mods on mute and have me just be like, you got 25 minutes left.
[1012.09s -> 1012.81s]  It's a contest.
[1012.81s -> 1013.53s]  It's not a tournament.
[1013.53s -> 1014.17s]  It's a contest.
[1014.17s -> 1017.16s]  Well, it's not even a contest.
[1017.16s -> 1020.22s]  When you're in school, you know, like a science class,
[1020.22s -> 1022.46s]  is it a contest with your fellow students?
[1022.46s -> 1025.78s]  No, you just get individually graded.
[1025.78s -> 1027.30s]  I don't want to give anybody an F though.
[1027.30s -> 1028.90s]  I feel like I haven't heard somebody's feelings.
[1028.90s -> 1030.26s]  Should I not give somebody an F?
[1030.26s -> 1034.12s]  Budwig is, I don't want to know.
[1034.76s -> 1040.60s]  I don't want to know what he's doing.
[1042.87s -> 1044.07s]  Give them all Fs.
[1044.07s -> 1049.48s]  They deserve it.
[1049.48s -> 1051.32s]  They all should have Fs.
[1055.86s -> 1057.75s]  Why is your camera off center?
[1057.75s -> 1058.39s]  I don't know.
[1058.39s -> 1060.47s]  Because I put it above this thing.
[1060.47s -> 1062.28s]  Oh, because I'm leaning in.
[1062.28s -> 1062.60s]  Okay.
[1062.60s -> 1069.53s]  Let me just live right now with the house flipper speed build in unofficial invitational.
[1069.53s -> 1075.10s]  Because does it even matter if I tweet something?
[1077.32s -> 1080.12s]  It's probably like only 50 people that see this through Twitter.
[1080.12s -> 1088.68s]  I was going to say the unofficial invitational.
[1088.68s -> 1089.40s]  I got time.
[1089.40s -> 1090.84s]  I like how I don't have to.
[1090.84s -> 1091.88s]  This is great.
[1091.88s -> 1095.99s]  We can just sit here and watch a clock for an hour and I don't have to do anything.
[1095.99s -> 1097.19s]  This is perfect.
[1097.19s -> 1098.71s]  I should do this more often.
[1098.71s -> 1102.74s]  Because I can hear in the other room, right?
[1102.74s -> 1104.82s]  A streamer freaking out.
[1104.82s -> 1107.06s]  Being like, how the fuck do I use this tool?
[1107.06s -> 1107.72s]  What the fuck?
[1107.72s -> 1108.36s]  This is this game.
[1108.36s -> 1109.48s]  What's wrong with this game?
[1109.48s -> 1110.60s]  I can't fucking pick this up.
[1111.40s -> 1112.76s]  They didn't read the instructions.
[1112.76s -> 1123.43s]  The birds are just chirping.
[1123.43s -> 1124.55s]  Ah, this is nice.
[1124.55s -> 1125.19s]  I feel great.
[1128.74s -> 1130.66s]  Look good right now.
[1130.66s -> 1142.65s]  All right, live right now with house flipper unofficial invitational with streamers.
[1142.65s -> 1145.34s]  I could add every single person, couldn't I?
[1145.34s -> 1150.70s]  Should I add every single person here?
[1155.94s -> 1156.34s]  You should.
[1158.62s -> 1159.26s]  Yeah.
[1159.26s -> 1161.10s]  I'm going to spend an hour.
[1161.10s -> 1172.68s]  I'm going to spend my timer is making a tweet in an hour.
[1172.68s -> 1173.40s]  Can I do it?
[1173.40s -> 1173.96s]  Can I make it?
[1173.96s -> 1178.04s]  Can I tweet my own event within the time that the event is taking place?
[1179.61s -> 1182.62s]  At this, there's two of these people.
[1182.62s -> 1183.34s]  I can't do it.
[1183.34s -> 1183.82s]  I can't do it.
[1183.82s -> 1184.54s]  I can't look at it.
[1184.54s -> 1189.91s]  I hate looking at this.
[1189.91s -> 1191.35s]  It's in your title.
[1191.35s -> 1193.56s]  What is my title?
[1193.56s -> 1194.44s]  Oh, that's right.
[1194.44s -> 1196.79s]  We're good.
[1196.79s -> 1197.19s]  Okay.
[1197.19s -> 1202.89s]  At this is going to go over the character limit.
[1202.97s -> 1213.11s]  At seadog at italics.
[1213.11s -> 1213.51s]  Okay.
[1214.44s -> 1218.44s]  At who else is here at Ludwig.
[1220.73s -> 1223.38s]  This is what this is what people do.
[1223.38s -> 1224.90s]  This is the longest tweet of all time.
[1228.28s -> 1229.80s]  At people that aren't here.
[1229.80s -> 1234.22s]  No, that's stupid.
[1234.22s -> 1236.39s]  At Kraken.
[1236.39s -> 1241.05s]  No, I'm just I'm doing it.
[1241.05s -> 1242.89s]  This this I can't this is too many characters.
[1242.89s -> 1247.66s]  I can't even do it.
[1247.66s -> 1248.78s]  You have Twitter plus.
[1248.78s -> 1249.66s]  I don't even know what that is.
[1249.66s -> 1254.58s]  What is Twitter plus?
[1254.58s -> 1255.94s]  Is a Twitter plus?
[1257.22s -> 1260.63s]  Are you stupid?
[1260.63s -> 1261.59s]  All right, I'll do it.
[1261.59s -> 1263.70s]  I'll do it.
[1263.70s -> 1264.34s]  I'll do it.
[1264.34s -> 1268.84s]  Hold on.
[1268.84s -> 1269.96s]  Let me stretch first.
[1270.52s -> 1271.61s]  I swear to God.
[1271.61s -> 1272.97s]  I actually like need to hold on.
[1272.97s -> 1281.51s]  I got a DM.
[1281.51s -> 1281.91s]  Poke.
[1285.78s -> 1286.34s]  Okay.
[1286.34s -> 1286.74s]  Hold on.
[1286.74s -> 1287.38s]  Hold on.
[1287.38s -> 1287.78s]  Hold on.
[1287.78s -> 1288.18s]  Hold on.
[1288.18s -> 1289.86s]  Poke is in my DMS right now.
[1289.86s -> 1296.02s]  Poke is I think on his way.
[1296.02s -> 1296.66s]  All right.
[1296.66s -> 1298.58s]  Well, I think poke is on his way here.
[1300.86s -> 1305.34s]  You got you got an hour and five minutes.
[1305.34s -> 1315.80s]  That's so funny.
[1315.80s -> 1318.34s]  Add extra time for poke.
[1318.34s -> 1321.06s]  Well, it was 60 minutes, but we made it 75.

[1447.32s -> 1451.24s]  Yeah, Vinesauce.
[1451.24s -> 1452.04s]  All right.
[1452.04s -> 1455.08s]  I'm ready to put my tweet out for my big event.
[1455.08s -> 1457.02s]  That's everybody, right?
[1457.02s -> 1459.90s]  Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[1459.90s -> 1460.78s]  Wait, I'm missing somebody.
[1460.78s -> 1463.66s]  Who am I missing?
[1463.66s -> 1464.70s]  No, no, no, there's one more.
[1464.70s -> 1466.06s]  No, no, no, I got Connery's pants.
[1466.06s -> 1466.62s]  No, I didn't.
[1466.62s -> 1467.50s]  I thought I put him first.
[1467.50s -> 1479.27s]  I put the other Connor.
[1479.27s -> 1483.06s]  Okay, there it is.
[1483.06s -> 1483.78s]  I'm ready to tweet it.
[1483.78s -> 1484.50s]  You guys ready?
[1484.50s -> 1487.69s]  Make sure you retweet it.
[1487.69s -> 1489.13s]  Make sure you retweet this.
[1489.13s -> 1493.88s]  Make sure I got everybody.
[1493.88s -> 1497.54s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[1497.54s -> 1504.34s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[1504.34s -> 1505.06s]  There we go.
[1505.06s -> 1505.94s]  Hey, look at that.
[1505.94s -> 1508.65s]  I did it.
[1508.65s -> 1509.53s]  Yeah.
[1509.53s -> 1516.34s]  So anyways, if you don't know anything about House Flipper,
[1518.42s -> 1520.98s]  let me give you some quick education here.
[1520.98s -> 1525.78s]  House Flipper is a game where you clean houses.
[1525.78s -> 1526.82s]  You flip them.
[1526.82s -> 1529.45s]  You add interior walls.
[1529.45s -> 1530.81s]  So you're like, I can clean.
[1530.81s -> 1536.10s]  You try to make it look as nice as you can.
[1536.10s -> 1537.38s]  Walls can come down.
[1537.38s -> 1539.48s]  I hope this isn't loud.
[1539.48s -> 1540.60s]  It probably will be.
[1540.60s -> 1542.92s]  So I'm going to do this for a sec.
[1542.92s -> 1545.10s]  I probably should have mentioned that to all the streamers.
[1545.10s -> 1547.42s]  That the, actually, no, it's okay.
[1547.42s -> 1548.54s]  No, they probably patched it.
[1548.54s -> 1552.73s]  You tagged the wrong vine sauce.
[1552.73s -> 1557.29s]  What do you mean?
[1557.29s -> 1560.76s]  I did?
[1560.76s -> 1563.46s]  No, I didn't.
[1563.46s -> 1564.42s]  Great tweet.
[1564.42s -> 1564.90s]  No, I didn't.
[1564.90s -> 1566.26s]  I got it right.
[1566.26s -> 1566.74s]  All right.
[1566.74s -> 1567.46s]  How are people doing?
[1568.02s -> 1570.42s]  Who is in the lead in your opinion?
[1570.42s -> 1572.50s]  Who is like, wow, they know exactly what they're doing.
[1582.55s -> 1583.75s]  I hate this tweet bit.
[1583.75s -> 1584.31s]  I just did it.
[1584.31s -> 1586.58s]  It's over.
[1586.58s -> 1588.82s]  It's the entire Vinesauce team account.
[1590.62s -> 1593.61s]  Well, it's all right.
[1593.61s -> 1593.93s]  It's all right.
[1593.93s -> 1599.22s]  Let me get back over here so I can see what people are doing.
[1599.22s -> 1600.18s]  Okay, we're good.
[1600.18s -> 1602.60s]  It technically is the wrong account.
[1602.60s -> 1608.63s]  Oh, that's all right.
[1608.63s -> 1608.87s]  All right.
[1608.87s -> 1611.51s]  So let me just give you a quick rundown.
[1611.51s -> 1612.95s]  Everybody is doing what I'm doing right now.
[1612.95s -> 1614.95s]  They're probably very far ahead of what I'm doing.
[1614.95s -> 1616.31s]  I wonder how many people are just panicking,
[1616.31s -> 1618.31s]  just sitting around biting their fingernails going,
[1618.31s -> 1619.35s]  I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[1619.35s -> 1620.68s]  I don't know what to do.
[1620.68s -> 1622.12s]  I will show you.
[1622.12s -> 1625.08s]  And I'm also here unmuted in case somebody has a question.
[1625.08s -> 1625.72s]  It's very important.
[1625.72s -> 1627.00s]  If somebody comes in here and is like,
[1627.56s -> 1629.16s]  hey, dude, can you please help me?
[1629.16s -> 1630.12s]  How do I do this again?
[1630.12s -> 1634.70s]  I want to be able to be here to tell them.
[1634.70s -> 1638.98s]  But House Flipper has many, many, many, many tools,
[1638.98s -> 1640.42s]  many things for you to do.
[1640.42s -> 1643.80s]  For instance, I can paint the walls whatever color I want.
[1643.80s -> 1645.88s]  I can take down pretty much any wall.
[1645.88s -> 1649.56s]  You can do wallpaper.
[1649.56s -> 1651.99s]  So let's just say for the instance this.
[1651.99s -> 1653.91s]  Yeah, like just panels.
[1653.91s -> 1655.27s]  I know a lot of you know this already,
[1655.27s -> 1657.03s]  but this might be people here that have no idea
[1657.03s -> 1658.39s]  that are here from other people's streams,
[1659.19s -> 1660.70s]  so on and so forth.
[1660.70s -> 1661.34s]  So I can.
[1661.34s -> 1662.86s]  Jerma, I have a question.
[1662.86s -> 1663.50s]  Yep.
[1663.50s -> 1665.18s]  Sorry, I scared the shit out of myself
[1665.18s -> 1666.54s]  because you came in here and I scared the shit.
[1666.54s -> 1667.58s]  You scared the shit out of me.
[1667.58s -> 1667.82s]  All right.
[1667.82s -> 1670.94s]  So is there a way to like bar window?
[1670.94s -> 1672.38s]  Like if I wanted like from the inside,
[1672.38s -> 1675.11s]  like put bars on the windows.
[1675.11s -> 1677.72s]  Like actually put bars on the windows.
[1677.72s -> 1677.96s]  Right.
[1677.96s -> 1680.12s]  Like so someone like couldn't get out of the room
[1680.84s -> 1683.51s]  if like through the window.
[1684.07s -> 1685.27s]  I don't think so.
[1685.27s -> 1687.88s]  Oh, but can they hear you?
[1687.88s -> 1688.36s]  I don't know.
[1688.36s -> 1688.84s]  Yeah, they can.
[1688.84s -> 1689.56s]  Yeah, they're lying to me.
[1690.36s -> 1692.28s]  I don't think you can put bars on the windows.
[1692.28s -> 1694.44s]  If you like bars on the windows,
[1694.44s -> 1696.04s]  I would say you probably should leave the bars
[1696.04s -> 1698.30s]  that are already on the windows.
[1698.30s -> 1698.94s]  Okay.
[1698.94s -> 1700.86s]  Because I don't think you can put.
[1700.86s -> 1701.74s]  You can sell the window.
[1701.74s -> 1703.34s]  You can put a new window in,
[1703.34s -> 1706.39s]  but I don't think you can put bars on it.
[1706.39s -> 1707.91s]  All right, I'll figure this out.
[1707.91s -> 1708.39s]  Thank you.
[1708.39s -> 1711.18s]  Yeah, so what happened to your eyebrows?
[1711.18s -> 1711.90s]  What do you mean?
[1711.90s -> 1716.42s]  What's wrong with my eyebrows?
[1716.42s -> 1718.58s]  I mean, my hair lightens up in the summer
[1718.58s -> 1719.86s]  because I'm out in the sun.
[1719.86s -> 1721.62s]  We're going to my garden, bro.
[1723.06s -> 1723.78s]  They're gone.
[1723.78s -> 1724.50s]  They're not.
[1724.50s -> 1725.54s]  What are you talking about?
[1725.54s -> 1728.15s]  What are you talking about?
[1728.15s -> 1734.52s]  My eyebrows lighten up in the summer.
[1734.52s -> 1743.16s]  My eyebrows are right here.
[1743.16s -> 1744.60s]  This grass in Vegas.
[1745.78s -> 1747.06s]  Well, I have sunflowers,
[1747.06s -> 1750.07s]  which I'm supposed to give you an update on those today,
[1750.07s -> 1753.91s]  but it's just not going to happen.
[1753.91s -> 1754.31s]  I'm sorry.
[1754.87s -> 1756.30s]  You have a unibrow.
[1756.30s -> 1756.78s]  I'm German.
[1756.78s -> 1758.26s]  Is that German?
[1758.26s -> 1762.10s]  This isn't cheating to just ask you a question mid-contest, is it?
[1762.10s -> 1762.66s]  No, no, no.
[1762.66s -> 1765.22s]  You're in fact the second or third person who's done so.
[1765.22s -> 1765.62s]  So yeah.
[1765.62s -> 1766.18s]  Thank God.
[1766.18s -> 1767.06s]  What can I do for you?
[1767.06s -> 1767.94s]  What can I do for your RT?
[1768.42s -> 1771.30s]  How do I fill in an existing hole in the house,
[1771.86s -> 1773.14s]  like in the concrete foundation,
[1773.14s -> 1775.94s]  like there's just gaps in the walls and I want to put wall in there.
[1775.94s -> 1776.18s]  Okay.
[1776.90s -> 1779.38s]  So you are going to hold right click
[1779.38s -> 1783.70s]  and you have build inlets or build walls and lintels.
[1783.70s -> 1788.30s]  Okay, I see build lintels.
[1788.30s -> 1790.38s]  That's for like a lower wall, is it?
[1790.38s -> 1792.78s]  Yeah, but lintels you can put up.
[1792.78s -> 1793.90s]  You can't put them down,
[1793.90s -> 1797.02s]  but you can build that build tool is how you cover up gaps.
[1797.02s -> 1801.26s]  Okay, but what if it's like a garage door or something like that?
[1801.50s -> 1803.38s]  Because I'm trying to...
[1803.38s -> 1804.02s]  Okay, let me see.
[1804.02s -> 1805.62s]  But so you want to...
[1805.62s -> 1809.21s]  What I'm imagining is you want to replace the garage door is what you're saying.
[1809.21s -> 1811.61s]  You know, I found a solution.
[1811.61s -> 1812.01s]  Yep.
[1812.01s -> 1813.13s]  It's grand.
[1813.13s -> 1813.61s]  Okay.
[1813.61s -> 1814.81s]  Thank you so much.
[1814.81s -> 1815.29s]  Thank you.
[1815.29s -> 1815.85s]  Yep, you got it.
[1815.85s -> 1816.65s]  You'll be all right from here.
[1816.65s -> 1817.05s]  Okay.
[1817.05s -> 1817.37s]  Thank you.
[1819.35s -> 1820.15s]  Tech support.
[1821.51s -> 1823.67s]  I'm here for an hour to meet tech support.
[1823.67s -> 1825.96s]  That's so funny though.
[1825.96s -> 1827.56s]  No help, no help, no help.
[1827.56s -> 1828.12s]  You didn't help.
[1828.12s -> 1828.92s]  Oh, I didn't help.
[1828.92s -> 1831.85s]  That's fine.
[1831.85s -> 1839.82s]  No help.
[1839.82s -> 1840.54s]  Tech support.
[1841.34s -> 1843.46s]  Time is actually ticking.
[1843.46s -> 1845.62s]  I heard nervousness in that voice.
[1845.62s -> 1851.74s]  Okay, let me make some stuff.
[1851.74s -> 1856.17s]  Let me do the lawn.
[1856.17s -> 1863.88s]  All right, let's get the tree trunk.
[1863.88s -> 1865.53s]  I'm going to clean up.
[1865.53s -> 1866.82s]  I'm going to do a lawn.
[1866.82s -> 1869.64s]  I think a lot of people are sleeping on the lawn.
[1869.64s -> 1871.32s]  I tried to make that really clear.
[1871.32s -> 1876.07s]  I did say, guys, the lawn is important.
[1876.07s -> 1877.67s]  Look at the lawn, the lawn.
[1877.67s -> 1883.34s]  Only one person asked about the lawn and I'm not going to tell you who.
[1883.34s -> 1886.06s]  I did have one inquisitive response about the lawn.
[1886.06s -> 1898.42s]  I should have read this syllabus.
[1898.42s -> 1898.98s]  Yeah.
[1905.77s -> 1909.10s]  Won't your own house impact grading?
[1909.10s -> 1910.62s]  No, no, we're going to get tours.
[1910.62s -> 1914.22s]  People are going to share through Discord or through potentially,
[1914.22s -> 1916.14s]  if it doesn't work, I can just pull up their streams too.
[1916.14s -> 1921.02s]  What about indoor lawns?
[1921.02s -> 1922.78s]  I'm not telling anybody how to make anything.
[1922.78s -> 1925.66s]  One of the theories was if people had fun doing this,
[1926.79s -> 1928.97s]  if this was a fun time for everybody,
[1928.97s -> 1931.93s]  is maybe expand it and do it again another time.
[1931.93s -> 1933.77s]  Now that people have understand the format
[1933.77s -> 1937.29s]  and include themings that you have to go by,
[1937.29s -> 1939.45s]  especially with House Flipper 2.
[1939.45s -> 1943.03s]  House Flipper 2 is going to be so much more elaborate than this
[1943.03s -> 1947.26s]  that I feel like that could be a lot of fun stuff.
[1947.26s -> 1948.71s]  I'm very interested.
[1948.71s -> 1950.63s]  But if people like it, if people are like,
[1950.63s -> 1951.99s]  yeah, that was really, really swell.
[1951.99s -> 1953.11s]  I want to do that again.
[1953.11s -> 1954.79s]  Then we can start to do things like,
[1954.79s -> 1961.69s]  hey, the theme for this one is green.
[1961.69s -> 1972.25s]  I'm going to give you three words, green, bark, and food.
[1972.25s -> 1973.05s]  And that's it.
[1973.05s -> 1976.39s]  Good luck and see what people come up with.
[1976.39s -> 1979.59s]  This one was more, I'm just going to let people go kind of wild
[1979.59s -> 1981.11s]  with whatever they want to do.
[1981.11s -> 1985.16s]  And I might just remove F.
[1985.16s -> 1987.72s]  I feel like some, I feel like a couple people are going to be like,
[1987.72s -> 1989.64s]  hey, man, I just had no idea what the fuck is going on.
[1991.40s -> 1993.14s]  And I don't want to give him an F.
[1993.14s -> 2002.82s]  Maybe I'll take away F, bark.
[2002.82s -> 2003.86s]  That's fair.
[2003.86s -> 2005.46s]  Yeah, F is a little harsh, I think.
[2005.46s -> 2008.92s]  But no F can ever be lower than 55 points.
[2011.78s -> 2016.30s]  Just keep it.
[2016.30s -> 2018.86s]  That's, no, you have to, that's spineless.
[2018.86s -> 2021.85s]  What do you mean?
[2021.85s -> 2025.58s]  Is it harsh?
[2025.58s -> 2026.94s]  Don't hurt their feelings.
[2026.94s -> 2029.18s]  I'm going to try not to.
[2029.18s -> 2035.48s]  We're down to, they, all right,
[2035.48s -> 2039.91s]  they're down to, they've only got 53 minutes.
[2039.91s -> 2046.82s]  It's unfair to the people that try.
[2046.82s -> 2052.07s]  I'm going to laugh my ass off.
[2052.07s -> 2053.59s]  I'm going to laugh my fucking ass off.
[2053.59s -> 2056.33s]  If poke shows up with like 20 minutes left
[2056.33s -> 2058.97s]  and just like fucking freaks out and gets in the game
[2058.97s -> 2061.61s]  and makes a banger of a house.
[2061.61s -> 2062.41s]  Do you know what I mean?
[2062.41s -> 2064.25s]  Like, I feel like that's possible.
[2064.25s -> 2067.24s]  That's so funny.
[2067.24s -> 2076.55s]  All right, let's do some, let's cut some, let's cut the grass.
[2076.55s -> 2078.79s]  I don't even know if people know you had, there's a lawnmower.
[2078.79s -> 2097.64s]  There's going to be people picking up blades of grass by hand.
[2097.64s -> 2099.48s]  Everybody is inside at this point.
[2099.48s -> 2100.84s]  Okay, interesting.
[2103.56s -> 2109.58s]  D won't be insulting.
[2109.58s -> 2110.78s]  Put on some music.
[2110.78s -> 2111.74s]  We could put some music on.
[2111.74s -> 2113.18s]  I mean, we're just hanging out anyways.
[2113.18s -> 2117.50s]  Put on, I don't know, like Animal Crossing.
[2117.50s -> 2131.24s]  It's the easy go-to.
[2131.24s -> 2133.30s]  Ah, nice.
[2137.40s -> 2139.72s]  Only 51 minutes left.
[2139.72s -> 2142.36s]  Oh, that's like, I got a long time to relax.
[2149.45s -> 2151.29s]  I'll change F to 60.
[2151.29s -> 2152.01s]  We'll make it a D.
[2155.19s -> 2155.99s]  Yeah, we'll make it a D.
[2158.46s -> 2161.98s]  If I was going to give an F, I'm just going to give a 60.
[2162.62s -> 2163.10s]  There you go.
[2163.66s -> 2165.02s]  The F just doesn't exist anymore.
[2172.41s -> 2174.09s]  Play Hell's Kitchen music.
[2174.09s -> 2175.85s]  Yeah, I'll do that when there's like five minutes left.
[2177.42s -> 2178.70s]  When there's like five or ten minutes left,
[2178.70s -> 2182.25s]  I will play Hell's Kitchen music and just start yelling at people.
[2182.25s -> 2184.09s]  Let's let, let's let them work.
[2184.09s -> 2186.09s]  Let them actually try.
[2186.09s -> 2187.45s]  I don't want to give pressure right now.
[2188.01s -> 2200.01s]  All right, let's sell this.
[2206.39s -> 2207.19s]  All right, Poke is here.
[2208.20s -> 2215.93s]  All right, let me get, let me get Poke just quick instructions.
[2215.93s -> 2216.97s]  I said poke hop on the call.
[2217.61s -> 2230.89s]  I can give him a quick, I can give him a quick, quick rundown.
[2237.34s -> 2240.46s]  He's, he's got, it's still 50 minutes.
[2240.46s -> 2243.90s]  Look, I, these are individual grades, so I can know that I can know.
[2244.62s -> 2246.84s]  Hey, hey, what's up?
[2246.84s -> 2247.40s]  Hi.
[2247.40s -> 2249.24s]  Hey, all right, we're live right now.
[2249.24s -> 2252.20s]  There's currently 50 minutes left in the competition.
[2252.20s -> 2254.36s]  We started with, yeah, we started with an hour.
[2254.36s -> 2256.28s]  We went up, we went up to 75 minutes.
[2256.28s -> 2259.69s]  So you're actually not that, you, you still got some time.
[2259.69s -> 2262.41s]  Listen, I read it was tomorrow and I was at an aquarium.
[2262.41s -> 2263.69s]  I, I'm home now.
[2263.69s -> 2264.58s]  I'm here.
[2264.58s -> 2267.30s]  Well, the aquarium probably sounds fucking awesome.
[2267.30s -> 2268.02s]  It was great.
[2268.02s -> 2268.90s]  It was great.
[2268.90s -> 2270.66s]  Yeah, but I don't want to, in the game, everything ready.
[2270.66s -> 2271.30s]  I'm ready to go.
[2271.30s -> 2273.70s]  I don't want to take up any more of your time, but the house you need to open,
[2273.70s -> 2276.42s]  you need to open, it's called Garden After the House Built.
[2276.42s -> 2277.54s]  That's the house everybody's doing.
[2277.54s -> 2278.58s]  That's the house you need to build.
[2278.58s -> 2281.40s]  Okay, which one?
[2281.40s -> 2286.06s]  So go to the laptop, go to browser, go to houses that you can buy
[2286.06s -> 2289.18s]  and make sure you've done the cheats to give yourself the half million dollars.
[2289.18s -> 2290.14s]  You're going to scroll down.
[2290.14s -> 2292.14s]  It's got a bunch of wooded windows.
[2292.14s -> 2293.02s]  You're going to get in there.
[2293.02s -> 2295.42s]  It's called Garden After House Built.
[2295.42s -> 2296.63s]  That's the one you're going to.
[2296.63s -> 2297.43s]  Garden After House Built.
[2297.43s -> 2298.23s]  That's the one right there.
[2298.23s -> 2300.63s]  Go, say go now and get going.
[2300.63s -> 2303.93s]  And you're only about 10 to 15 minutes behind.
[2303.93s -> 2304.33s]  All right.
[2304.33s -> 2305.37s]  Going in now.
[2305.37s -> 2305.93s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[2305.93s -> 2306.25s]  All right.
[2306.25s -> 2307.05s]  Timer's gone.
[2307.05s -> 2307.93s]  Good luck.
[2307.93s -> 2313.74s]  Bye.
[2313.74s -> 2314.22s]  All right.
[2314.78s -> 2318.90s]  Good to see Poke.
[2318.90s -> 2323.14s]  We got everybody now.
[2323.14s -> 2324.26s]  The aquarium.
[2324.26s -> 2326.92s]  Well, that sounds fun.
[2329.13s -> 2331.37s]  He's freaking out right now.
[2334.14s -> 2338.94s]  Well, if you see this and knowing that you've lost potentially 25, 30 minutes of time,
[2339.83s -> 2341.91s]  it's almost like, what do I even do?
[2341.91s -> 2343.19s]  I guess go through the windows.
[2346.55s -> 2347.75s]  Jerma, why weren't you invited?
[2353.88s -> 2356.86s]  I tried to give a tutorial of how to build additions,
[2356.86s -> 2359.91s]  but I feel like, okay, you know when a teacher,
[2360.63s -> 2366.26s]  when a teacher explains something and very clearly the whole class is quiet
[2366.82s -> 2372.20s]  and everyone's like, all right, can you show us again?
[2372.84s -> 2376.76s]  It's just like, oh, shit.
[2376.76s -> 2377.08s]  All right.
[2377.08s -> 2378.20s]  Nobody got that.
[2378.20s -> 2379.16s]  Nobody got that.
[2379.90s -> 2381.50s]  I have to, I have to do it again
[2382.14s -> 2387.96s]  because there's very specific things you can't do with the addition builder.
[2387.96s -> 2390.33s]  I wonder, I wonder.
[2390.33s -> 2391.21s]  This is House Lipper 1.
[2391.21s -> 2392.73s]  House Lipper 2 is not out yet.
[2392.73s -> 2399.62s]  Play Halls of Torment.
[2399.62s -> 2400.66s]  I actually saw that.
[2400.66s -> 2401.70s]  I wanted to play it.
[2401.70s -> 2402.66s]  That's definitely on the list 100%.
[2410.57s -> 2411.45s]  It's very pog.
[2419.48s -> 2421.48s]  Joel thinks he's almost out of time.
[2424.76s -> 2429.50s]  You're not almost out of time.
[2430.14s -> 2433.43s]  The Hell's Kitchen music hasn't started.
[2433.43s -> 2434.71s]  That's so fucking funny.
[2437.51s -> 2441.91s]  I don't know if, can we, mods, can you undefinite and unmute everybody for,
[2441.91s -> 2443.59s]  oh, no, no, just undefinite everybody for a second.
[2443.59s -> 2444.31s]  Don't unmute them.
[2444.31s -> 2445.67s]  Just undefinite them in here.
[2445.67s -> 2447.51s]  Can we do that so I can tell them to the time check?
[2449.29s -> 2449.93s]  We cannot.
[2450.73s -> 2451.53s]  We can't.
[2451.53s -> 2452.09s]  Okay, okay.
[2452.73s -> 2466.57s]  Well, sorry everybody, but we can only, okay, we can ping them.
[2466.57s -> 2471.93s]  Yeah, maybe ping everybody and just say, hey, 45 minutes, 45 minute warning.
[2472.49s -> 2474.42s]  This is going quick.
[2474.42s -> 2475.54s]  Oh, this is, I'm excited.
[2475.54s -> 2476.74s]  I'm so happy about this.
[2476.74s -> 2477.78s]  I'm having fun.
[2477.78s -> 2480.50s]  I'm having fun just like experiencing what I think
[2480.50s -> 2482.26s]  I'm going to experience in 45 minutes.
[2482.90s -> 2492.92s]  Come on, dig.
[2492.92s -> 2494.42s]  I can't dig this one.
[2494.42s -> 2498.14s]  Oh, is this a bug in this map?
[2500.34s -> 2501.46s]  Are they all freaking out about this?
[2511.19s -> 2513.82s]  Okay, there we go.
[2513.82s -> 2515.58s]  Yeah, alert, 45 minutes remaining.
[2516.14s -> 2519.10s]  What about a time extension?
[2520.70s -> 2522.22s]  We talked about a time extension.
[2523.59s -> 2527.03s]  The one thing that's important about this whole stream here
[2527.03s -> 2532.46s]  is everybody has to give a five to seven minute tour at the end of this.
[2532.46s -> 2535.27s]  And I don't want to extend it too far because the people that,
[2535.27s -> 2539.43s]  there's some people from EU, there's people with time constraints today.
[2539.43s -> 2540.87s]  And I didn't want it to be like, oh yeah, like,
[2540.87s -> 2551.90s]  so this would be like a seven hour experience for all of you.
[2551.90s -> 2553.90s]  I don't think anybody even knows that you can do this.
[2555.67s -> 2559.19s]  See, what I'm really looking forward to is somebody kind of thinking outside the box.
[2560.06s -> 2561.58s]  You know what would be outside the box?
[2562.14s -> 2565.02s]  Keeping the whole house boarded up and making an incredible garden.
[2565.88s -> 2567.64s]  That's where you get creativity A plus for me.
[2568.57s -> 2569.45s]  Don't tell them that though.
[2569.45s -> 2570.81s]  Don't ever tell anybody that.
[2570.81s -> 2572.33s]  Why is the game so dark?
[2573.14s -> 2574.90s]  Because it's technically nighttime right now.
[2574.90s -> 2575.70s]  I don't know why.
[2576.26s -> 2584.47s]  I guess I could just reset it so you can see better.
[2586.04s -> 2587.40s]  That's inside the box.
[2587.40s -> 2590.12s]  No, that's outside the box because the house is inside.
[2590.12s -> 2593.99s]  That would be outside the box.
[2593.99s -> 2595.83s]  Let poke bill for an extra 15 minutes.
[2595.83s -> 2596.71s]  That's actually fair.
[2597.35s -> 2601.27s]  That's fair because poke is not scheduled to do his tour until a little bit later.
[2601.27s -> 2602.31s]  So that's fair for me.
[2602.31s -> 2602.79s]  That's fair.
[2607.78s -> 2611.99s]  So let's just go browser.
[2613.83s -> 2616.31s]  I'm just going to just teleport around just to get it back to daytime.
[2616.31s -> 2621.75s]  Derma explaining things is so funny to me.
[2621.75s -> 2622.71s]  Can you please help poke?
[2622.71s -> 2623.91s]  He's freaking out.
[2623.91s -> 2628.38s]  Poke need help.
[2629.35s -> 2630.47s]  I can answer questions.
[2630.47s -> 2646.36s]  I can answer technical questions.
[2646.36s -> 2646.84s]  Tech support.
[2646.84s -> 2653.54s]  Yeah, he's panicking.
[2662.23s -> 2663.91s]  There we go.
[2663.91s -> 2666.47s]  So it seems like most people have started outside,
[2670.65s -> 2672.09s]  which is fair.
[2672.09s -> 2674.25s]  But how many of them actually put grass down?
[2674.81s -> 2677.19s]  And what is their philosophy?
[2677.19s -> 2679.11s]  And what the fuck is philosophy?
[2679.11s -> 2679.67s]  I don't know.
[2680.31s -> 2682.71s]  I just put it there because I wanted to have four grades.
[2684.09s -> 2685.45s]  So I have mods.
[2685.45s -> 2690.20s]  I do want to bring this up because so when we do chats grade,
[2690.20s -> 2692.92s]  we're just going to do it in just solid letters.
[2693.64s -> 2697.93s]  So it's only going to be A, B, C, or D,
[2697.93s -> 2702.73s]  because that'll be technically that'd be 95, 85, 75, 65 points.
[2703.29s -> 2705.29s]  So we can't do like a whole scale.
[2705.29s -> 2706.41s]  I don't think I mean, maybe we could.
[2706.41s -> 2708.01s]  How many how many things do we have in the poll?
[2708.01s -> 2711.98s]  We could do A plus A, A.
[2711.98s -> 2715.22s]  I don't want to do that many though,
[2715.22s -> 2716.90s]  because it's based on points.
[2716.90s -> 2722.58s]  So I think 95 could be fine if you wanted to do an A.
[2722.58s -> 2726.23s]  Poke is trying to sell the walls right now.
[2736.63s -> 2737.51s]  Hey, give him a break.
[2737.51s -> 2738.71s]  He was at the aquarium.
[2738.71s -> 2757.59s]  Okay, he was at the aquarium.
[2757.59s -> 2761.05s]  So how poke could really spin this.
[2761.05s -> 2763.16s]  I don't want to give anybody any help.
[2763.16s -> 2764.28s]  No help, no help.
[2764.28s -> 2766.44s]  But there is an animal DLC.
[2766.44s -> 2767.80s]  And if you figure out how to use it,
[2767.80s -> 2770.36s]  if you can go back and maybe see how to do that,
[2770.36s -> 2775.62s]  he could make an aquarium
[2775.62s -> 2778.42s]  and just show us all the fishes that he saw.
[2778.42s -> 2785.21s]  I don't want to give anybody any tips though.
[2785.21s -> 2787.85s]  Yeah, we'll just do A, B, C, D.
[2789.54s -> 2794.42s]  And it'll do the point system will be to be 95, 85, 75, 65
[2794.42s -> 2796.25s]  for your grade.
[2796.25s -> 2799.19s]  I have a whole spreadsheet here to calculate everything.
[2799.19s -> 2799.91s]  So don't worry.
[2799.91s -> 2803.10s]  Vinny's doing his best.
[2803.66s -> 2806.65s]  Ludwig is doing something horrendous.
[2813.80s -> 2815.00s]  I can't, I cannot wait.
[2817.48s -> 2818.36s]  We're getting down there.
[2819.00s -> 2821.18s]  Let me just at least paint one of the walls.
[2821.18s -> 2821.98s]  Because people are going to be like,
[2821.98s -> 2823.02s]  well, what about your house?
[2823.02s -> 2823.90s]  What about your house?
[2823.90s -> 2825.42s]  And I'd be like, well, it's not my.
[2825.42s -> 2826.70s]  So let me get it to look at least okay.
[2827.42s -> 2845.43s]  The grading scale, the grading scale has changed.
[2845.43s -> 2851.19s]  I mean, poke is asking if other people scrimmed for this.
[2851.19s -> 2851.99s]  I don't think so.
[2853.21s -> 2858.28s]  A is now 90 to 100, not 95.
[2858.28s -> 2860.94s]  I'm going on a boomer grades.
[2860.94s -> 2866.25s]  Sorry.
[2866.25s -> 2869.02s]  And A, when I was in school,
[2869.02s -> 2873.88s]  an A minus was 90, 91, 92.
[2873.88s -> 2877.00s]  An A was 93, 94, 95, 96.
[2877.00s -> 2878.76s]  And I believe also 97.
[2878.76s -> 2881.56s]  An A plus I think was 98, 99, 100.
[2881.56s -> 2886.60s]  Yeah, A plus is 100.
[2886.60s -> 2889.08s]  A plus was 100, 99, and 98.
[2889.08s -> 2892.63s]  I believe 93 to 97 was just A.
[2892.63s -> 2896.38s]  We're not Americans.
[2896.38s -> 2897.40s]  I am.
[2897.40s -> 2898.76s]  And this is my American school.
[2898.76s -> 2901.24s]  This is my American house flipper school.
[2901.24s -> 2904.46s]  We're going by American grades.
[2904.46s -> 2906.38s]  Sorry.
[2906.38s -> 2908.63s]  97 is an A plus.
[2908.63s -> 2909.99s]  I think that's true.
[2909.99s -> 2921.40s]  He's American.
[2921.40s -> 2922.60s]  Is that what do you mean?
[2922.60s -> 2923.61s]  Yeah.
[2923.61s -> 2924.11s]  Yeah.
[2925.37s -> 2930.40s]  Wait.
[2930.40s -> 2930.72s]  All right.
[2930.72s -> 2937.92s]  Anyways, what about an S plus rank?
[2937.92s -> 2939.68s]  Now I like S.
[2939.68s -> 2942.49s]  I think S is a great addition to have.
[2942.49s -> 2947.05s]  But there's no S in high school or college grades.
[2947.05s -> 2960.64s]  Can we say poke's viewers are messing with him?
[2960.64s -> 2962.72s]  Poke's viewers are messing with how many minutes he has
[2962.72s -> 2964.08s]  and he is mega panicking.
[2968.92s -> 2971.34s]  Poor poke.
[2971.34s -> 2973.58s]  He probably was like walking around like,
[2973.58s -> 2976.56s]  wow, oh, look at that shark.
[2976.56s -> 2978.00s]  Whoa, look at that fish.
[2978.00s -> 2980.88s]  And he didn't even know that that 75 minutes had started.
[2982.94s -> 2985.42s]  He's probably sitting there like, oh, whoa, this is so cool.
[2985.42s -> 2987.66s]  He probably went to lunch, probably had a wonderful lunch
[2987.66s -> 2999.36s]  and just had no idea that he was being timed at the aquarium.
[2999.36s -> 3007.20s]  You've ruined his field trip.
[3007.20s -> 3014.75s]  You called all these people into work.
[3014.75s -> 3016.83s]  People are telling me he has four minutes.
[3016.83s -> 3017.47s]  All right.
[3017.47s -> 3022.51s]  Communicate with poke that he has 37 minutes left and longer.
[3022.51s -> 3027.71s]  He actually has 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52.
[3027.71s -> 3030.83s]  Poke has like another hour to make his house.
[3030.83s -> 3034.25s]  Poke has another hour.
[3034.25s -> 3042.83s]  Dude, he is soaking right now.
[3042.83s -> 3043.95s]  What do you mean?
[3043.95s -> 3045.79s]  He went swimming at the aquarium?
[3045.79s -> 3050.11s]  What are you talking about?
[3050.11s -> 3050.75s]  You can't.
[3050.75s -> 3054.57s]  Does this place have a pool?
[3055.92s -> 3066.43s]  Poke gets an extra 30 minutes.
[3066.43s -> 3070.57s]  I think it's fair to give poke at least 15 to 20 extra minutes.
[3070.57s -> 3088.49s]  Poke's title is in all caps.
[3088.49s -> 3091.13s]  You know, it's going to be really fun.
[3091.13s -> 3094.11s]  One of the reasons I did this a whole event is obviously
[3094.11s -> 3095.95s]  I'm just kind of walking around and just,
[3095.95s -> 3096.99s]  I'm just talking to you guys.
[3097.55s -> 3098.59s]  Like I'm the judge, right?
[3098.59s -> 3102.03s]  I'm just waiting.
[3102.03s -> 3103.39s]  There's a lot of content for him.
[3103.39s -> 3106.03s]  I just want to go watch everybody's stream.
[3106.03s -> 3108.36s]  That's what I'm going to do tonight.
[3108.36s -> 3110.76s]  I think like lying down in like bed
[3110.76s -> 3112.28s]  or just like on the couch or something.
[3112.84s -> 3115.08s]  I'm just going to go through and just pick out everybody's
[3115.08s -> 3120.65s]  and just kind of just sit there and watch how they did it.
[3120.65s -> 3121.77s]  This sounds fun.
[3121.77s -> 3123.21s]  All right.
[3123.21s -> 3124.01s]  Let's put some grass down.
[3129.23s -> 3130.91s]  It is turf, I believe.
[3130.91s -> 3131.15s]  Yes.
[3131.71s -> 3140.73s]  Oh, wrong way.
[3141.37s -> 3141.69s]  It's all right.
[3141.69s -> 3142.33s]  I can do both ways.
[3144.36s -> 3150.46s]  There we.
[3150.46s -> 3152.30s]  Vinny has one room.
[3154.08s -> 3156.48s]  Vinny does not know how to spell refrigerator.
[3160.91s -> 3165.72s]  Do we need to give everybody an extra 20 minutes?
[3167.61s -> 3169.53s]  Do we have to give everybody an extra 10 to 20 minutes?
[3173.28s -> 3176.88s]  If people are down, I am willing to extend by another 20 minutes.
[3176.88s -> 3180.54s]  But it depends.
[3180.54s -> 3181.98s]  People might have something to do today.
[3182.78s -> 3189.07s]  They need it.
[3189.07s -> 3189.55s]  They need it.
[3189.55s -> 3190.11s]  They need it.
[3190.11s -> 3190.59s]  No, no.
[3190.59s -> 3192.19s]  It's way funnier if you don't.
[3192.19s -> 3197.00s]  An hour goes by pretty quickly as you see,
[3197.00s -> 3198.52s]  especially when you know it's counting down.
[3199.08s -> 3201.21s]  All right.
[3201.21s -> 3201.77s]  Here's what we're going to do.
[3201.77s -> 3205.42s]  We're going to stick to the plan when it's pencils down.
[3205.42s -> 3207.18s]  What we're going to do is we're going to get everybody in a call
[3207.18s -> 3208.54s]  and I'm going to propose.
[3209.18s -> 3210.14s]  How does everybody feel?
[3210.78s -> 3214.46s]  Does everybody feel like if we could all get a majority
[3214.46s -> 3216.06s]  for an extra 20 minutes?
[3216.06s -> 3217.02s]  We'll see.
[3223.07s -> 3225.31s]  If not, then we might just go for it.
[3225.31s -> 3226.99s]  We might get three or four people that are like,
[3226.99s -> 3229.80s]  look, man, I've got shit to do today.
[3229.80s -> 3233.72s]  And that's all right.
[3233.72s -> 3242.99s]  It's got to be unanimous.
[3242.99s -> 3245.07s]  Vinny doesn't know how to spell refrigerator.
[3257.13s -> 3258.33s]  You spell it.
[3258.33s -> 3274.48s]  OK, how do you spell it?
[3275.56s -> 3277.00s]  How do you spell refrigerator?
[3278.33s -> 3280.83s]  Is there a quicker way to paint?
[3280.83s -> 3281.15s]  Yep.
[3281.15s -> 3284.72s]  OK, so when you are you in, are you inside or outside?
[3284.72s -> 3285.52s]  I'm inside.
[3285.52s -> 3286.96s]  OK, so you're inside.
[3286.96s -> 3288.24s]  You have the painting tool, right?
[3289.07s -> 3292.27s]  You you can paint because you if you did you did
[3292.27s -> 3294.94s]  you did the cheats to make sure that you did all the perks, right?
[3294.94s -> 3295.66s]  Yeah, I got them all.
[3295.66s -> 3298.62s]  OK, so you can paint three or four walls at the same time,
[3298.62s -> 3303.66s]  but there is no faster way to go with paint unless you go outside with the paint spray.
[3303.66s -> 3304.30s]  Oh, fuck.
[3304.30s -> 3304.86s]  That sucks.
[3304.86s -> 3309.90s]  OK, so you need to what you can do up to four walls at a time painting.
[3309.90s -> 3312.14s]  But yeah, you do have to paint the walls individually.
[3312.14s -> 3313.34s]  You do.
[3313.34s -> 3314.14s]  Oh, that sucks.
[3314.14s -> 3315.18s]  OK, that's fine.
[3315.18s -> 3318.62s]  By the way, there is 32 minutes remaining as of right now.
[3319.34s -> 3320.06s]  I think it'll be fine.
[3320.06s -> 3320.70s]  I think it'll be fine.
[3320.70s -> 3321.34s]  Thank you so much.
[3321.90s -> 3327.68s]  Just want to make sure you are aware.
[3327.68s -> 3333.00s]  Yeah, so the question that Connor had is a very good one.
[3333.00s -> 3344.80s]  It is OK.
[3344.80s -> 3351.48s]  So for instance, like Connor is asking is, can you go faster than this?
[3351.48s -> 3354.04s]  And it's going to be slow for me because I don't have all the upgrades.
[3354.04s -> 3358.91s]  But if you have all the upgrades, you can do a few panels at a time.
[3358.91s -> 3360.43s]  You can do I think up to four or five.
[3360.43s -> 3362.24s]  So but that's part of it.
[3362.24s -> 3368.49s]  That's part of your process is what's important.
[3368.49s -> 3372.16s]  I mean, it's just it's it's with all the upgrades.
[3372.80s -> 3376.43s]  Should be able to get at least most of a wall.
[3376.43s -> 3377.88s]  All right.
[3377.88s -> 3378.44s]  Refrigerator.
[3378.44s -> 3378.84s]  Right.
[3378.84s -> 3379.64s]  How do I do that?
[3379.64s -> 3381.29s]  OK.
[3381.29s -> 3381.85s]  Refrigerator.
[3381.85s -> 3383.71s]  How do you spell it?
[3383.71s -> 3383.95s]  Re.
[3387.82s -> 3388.46s]  There's no D.
[3389.39s -> 3391.47s]  It's just Refrigerator.
[3391.47s -> 3392.19s]  Really?
[3392.19s -> 3396.48s]  But that's how you spell fridge.
[3396.48s -> 3402.51s]  That's how you spell fridge.
[3402.51s -> 3403.55s]  So why is it Re?
[3404.43s -> 3406.03s]  Why is it not Refrigerator?
[3406.03s -> 3408.35s]  Why is it Refrigerator?
[3408.35s -> 3408.83s]  That's weird.
[3412.27s -> 3415.63s]  Fridge is with a D.
[3415.63s -> 3420.52s]  Can you do can you do turf in the house?
[3420.52s -> 3421.40s]  No, you can't.
[3421.40s -> 3422.52s]  You can't do turf in the house.
[3422.52s -> 3423.48s]  Sorry, everybody.
[3423.48s -> 3426.83s]  What colors do I want to do?
[3427.90s -> 3429.66s]  I should just do like a congratulations.
[3429.66s -> 3436.89s]  You did it.
[3436.89s -> 3437.13s]  All right.
[3437.13s -> 3440.68s]  I'm going to put like just like party stuff here.
[3440.68s -> 3448.49s]  Uh, like party, uh, like decorations.
[3448.49s -> 3449.05s]  Christmas.
[3449.05s -> 3449.61s]  Here we go.
[3451.63s -> 3452.11s]  Welcome.
[3454.70s -> 3455.26s]  Yeah, here we go.
[3455.26s -> 3465.15s]  We'll put like this everywhere.
[3465.15s -> 3466.11s]  Uh, we'll do that.
[3466.11s -> 3473.16s]  We'll do, um, we'll put like Christmas stuff maybe.
[3473.16s -> 3473.64s]  Here we go.
[3479.69s -> 3492.80s]  I guess your eyes are sucking my soul out.
[3492.80s -> 3495.00s]  Hey, you need to relax.
[3495.00s -> 3495.64s]  All right.
[3495.64s -> 3499.40s]  Um, by the way, I, I feel like people didn't look into this,
[3499.40s -> 3502.12s]  but there's a grappling hook to get up here.
[3502.12s -> 3502.92s]  It's all right.
[3502.92s -> 3506.28s]  I, I know they were under, they're under a little bit of stress.
[3506.28s -> 3509.85s]  This is a chainsaw.
[3511.05s -> 3512.65s]  You can get trees down faster.
[3517.69s -> 3531.95s]  Build a wipeout course.
[3531.95s -> 3533.63s]  Ludwig found the flamethrower.
[3533.63s -> 3536.56s]  It's possible he just ruins his whole thing then.
[3536.56s -> 3538.04s]  Don't tell him.
[3538.04s -> 3540.60s]  Ludwig might accidentally click the button and burn the whole house down.
[3540.60s -> 3551.88s]  And then, sorry, he already did that.
[3552.68s -> 3553.16s]  Oh, no.
[3563.92s -> 3568.92s]  Ludwig cannot find a certain paint right now.
[3568.92s -> 3575.50s]  There was some interesting questions because, so, the question was asked.
[3575.50s -> 3577.10s]  Hey, this is two stories, man.
[3577.10s -> 3578.06s]  That's a lot.
[3578.06s -> 3580.16s]  And I was like, yeah, it is.
[3580.16s -> 3580.96s]  Oh, all right.
[3580.96s -> 3583.56s]  And they were like, oh, okay.
[3584.28s -> 3586.78s]  But here's the thing.
[3586.78s -> 3588.33s]  Take a look.
[3588.33s -> 3589.69s]  You want to build the houses.
[3589.69s -> 3591.87s]  You can make this a whole thing.
[3591.87s -> 3599.24s]  I wonder who's the most focused.
[3599.24s -> 3601.88s]  I think they were anticipating it was going to be one floor.
[3601.88s -> 3606.33s]  If you want to do one really great floor, that's fine.
[3606.33s -> 3608.57s]  Your complexity and your structure will be suffering,
[3608.57s -> 3610.89s]  but your creativity score might be through the roof.
[3619.08s -> 3620.84s]  I looked at Lud's stream and I regret it.
[3629.82s -> 3631.98s]  Here's a really important question.
[3631.98s -> 3634.84s]  Has anybody cleaned their whole yard?
[3634.84s -> 3640.70s]  Has anybody cleaned their yard?
[3643.72s -> 3644.60s]  Most people did.
[3646.30s -> 3648.22s]  Hoke is kind of cooking low key.
[3648.22s -> 3648.78s]  All right.
[3648.78s -> 3649.42s]  All right.
[3649.42s -> 3652.03s]  Let's let it out.
[3652.03s -> 3652.99s]  Let's let him cook.
[3652.99s -> 3658.94s]  Doug Doug did that first.
[3660.75s -> 3670.28s]  Ludwig is eating a brick on stream right now.
[3670.28s -> 3673.10s]  That sounds pretty fucked up.
[3673.10s -> 3679.72s]  All right.
[3679.72s -> 3691.52s]  I'm going to make my bathroom.
[3691.52s -> 3694.00s]  I've never seen Ludwig this focused.
[3697.13s -> 3699.05s]  How much extra time should poke get?
[3699.05s -> 3700.73s]  Poke should get at least.
[3700.73s -> 3704.12s]  When did he come into the call?
[3704.12s -> 3706.43s]  When did poke come into the call?
[3706.43s -> 3710.46s]  What was the timer when poke came into the call?
[3710.46s -> 3712.70s]  It was 50 minutes.
[3712.70s -> 3714.06s]  So 50, one hour.
[3716.64s -> 3723.29s]  So poke should get poke should get 20 minutes extra.
[3723.29s -> 3735.50s]  Give poke an extra 20 because that would be the same time.
[3735.50s -> 3747.12s]  I think, I think that's fair.
[3747.12s -> 3748.24s]  25 would be the same.
[3750.20s -> 3750.76s]  We have to do.
[3750.76s -> 3752.12s]  We have to deduce five minutes.
[3752.12s -> 3753.72s]  We have to deduce at least five minutes.
[3753.72s -> 3764.19s]  The, you know, we got to give a five minute penalty.
[3764.19s -> 3766.19s]  I wonder if anyone's going to do anything outside.
[3766.19s -> 3768.51s]  I feel like everyone's just like, okay, I got to build walls.
[3768.51s -> 3769.07s]  I got to do this.
[3769.07s -> 3769.95s]  What am I doing in this house?
[3769.95s -> 3770.59s]  Okay, I want to build this.
[3770.59s -> 3771.55s]  I want to do that.
[3771.55s -> 3780.12s]  But does anybody make like a nice fish pond out here?
[3780.12s -> 3791.29s]  All right, let me do my bathroom.
[3791.29s -> 3792.09s]  You mean deduct.
[3795.53s -> 3797.05s]  I don't want to read chat anymore
[3797.05s -> 3799.13s]  because that's funny what you just said.
[3799.13s -> 3802.17s]  So I have to say it, but I, because I can't, I can't be,
[3802.17s -> 3803.69s]  I have to be unbiased.
[3803.69s -> 3805.93s]  Somebody said poke is painting his whole house right now
[3805.93s -> 3810.08s]  with a paint color called intense rust.
[3810.08s -> 3812.96s]  And I, I kind of have to delete that from my brain.
[3812.96s -> 3817.28s]  I have to pretend like I did not hear that.
[3817.28s -> 3818.96s]  I just, I have to just know.
[3818.96s -> 3819.92s]  I can't know that.
[3819.92s -> 3826.65s]  All right, let me get a door.
[3826.65s -> 3836.75s]  That's a good bathroom door.
[3836.75s -> 3837.87s]  I guess I could have typed it.
[3837.87s -> 3857.52s]  This is funny.
[3857.52s -> 3858.96s]  I'm having so much fun right now
[3858.96s -> 3861.92s]  because I'm just imagining everybody else's streams.
[3861.92s -> 3863.77s]  Is that weird?
[3863.77s -> 3864.97s]  I'm sitting here just kind of hanging out.
[3865.53s -> 3868.33s]  I'm watching imaginary streams right now.
[3868.33s -> 3872.35s]  I don't know how many of you guys here are doing the same thing.
[3872.35s -> 3875.92s]  Or if you're jumping around to see what people are doing.
[3875.92s -> 3878.48s]  But I, I'm watching imaginary streams.
[3878.48s -> 3883.04s]  I want, do people even know how to do what I just did?
[3884.57s -> 3886.57s]  Like the door in the wall?
[3886.57s -> 3888.65s]  Like in the inlet of the wall?
[3888.65s -> 3891.05s]  I'm not even sure anybody knows how to do that.
[3891.05s -> 3904.89s]  Connor is watching a tutorial.
[3904.89s -> 3910.00s]  That makes me, that's so funny to me.
[3910.00s -> 3912.24s]  I can't wait to watch everybody's perspectives later.
[3912.24s -> 3925.07s]  20 minute warning.
[3926.67s -> 3928.43s]  The mods are paying in everybody in the channel.
[3928.99s -> 3945.47s]  Could do Sims build invitational.
[3945.47s -> 3947.79s]  I think the reason why this was doing it for me,
[3947.79s -> 3951.63s]  the reason I thought this was funnier instead of the Sims
[3951.63s -> 3954.68s]  is because first of all, it's 3D.
[3954.68s -> 3956.44s]  It's a first person 3D game.
[3956.44s -> 3962.33s]  And this game is very kind of oddly complicated.
[3962.33s -> 3966.09s]  So you really do kind of need to know a lot of stuff about this game.
[3967.37s -> 3971.29s]  I did try to give a detailed couple of pages of information to people.
[3971.29s -> 3973.61s]  But even still, like I feel like there's some things,
[3973.61s -> 3975.21s]  like how do you put panels on walls?
[3975.21s -> 3976.41s]  I don't fucking know.
[3976.41s -> 3984.99s]  I have no idea.
[3984.99s -> 3986.19s]  Yeah, the one minute warning.
[3986.19s -> 3990.25s]  Yeah, once we get to 10 minutes, the Gordon Ramsay music is coming.
[3990.25s -> 4004.06s]  All right, this must be a bathroom.
[4004.06s -> 4011.98s]  We need bathroom.
[4011.98s -> 4012.94s]  Oh, I need a fixture.
[4012.94s -> 4014.84s]  They don't even know that either, do they?
[4014.92s -> 4018.80s]  Yeah, you need an actual fixture on the wall.
[4018.80s -> 4022.09s]  You need the thing that the toilet can actually sit in.
[4022.09s -> 4023.05s]  You need plumbing.
[4023.05s -> 4030.33s]  Do they know that?
[4030.33s -> 4033.21s]  Yeah, you'd like need this in the ground.
[4033.21s -> 4042.32s]  Does anybody know this?
[4042.32s -> 4046.12s]  There's no way they know.
[4046.12s -> 4047.32s]  No, they definitely do.
[4047.32s -> 4051.24s]  Okay, part of the tutorial I gave them was to do the first couple missions
[4051.24s -> 4065.36s]  to understand this, like what this means.
[4065.36s -> 4067.84s]  We might need like a 15 minute extension.
[4067.84s -> 4072.56s]  Well, I guess if you do type in toilet,
[4073.12s -> 4076.19s]  you'll see this and be like, wait, do I need that?
[4076.19s -> 4080.94s]  And everybody's chats, I'm assuming are yelling at them how to do this.
[4080.94s -> 4091.96s]  And they have to assemble it too.
[4091.96s -> 4094.36s]  I can't wait to see half of the shit that's just not even assembled.
[4094.36s -> 4097.53s]  Complexity and structure.
[4097.53s -> 4104.38s]  Oh, that's minus my own points for complexity and structure.
[4104.38s -> 4106.62s]  Ludwig is doing the Kubrick stare right now.
[4106.62s -> 4111.20s]  Can I ask, how is italics doing?
[4112.91s -> 4114.03s]  How is italics doing?
[4114.03s -> 4115.23s]  Is italics doing okay?
[4116.03s -> 4120.89s]  It's doing great.
[4120.89s -> 4125.47s]  How is Doug Doug doing?
[4125.47s -> 4130.67s]  Connor Eads Pants came in and asked a very specific question
[4130.67s -> 4132.83s]  about putting bars on the windows.
[4132.83s -> 4139.52s]  So I don't even want to know what he's doing.
[4139.52s -> 4140.80s]  Joel is losing his mind.
[4140.80s -> 4143.04s]  Vinnie, it feels like everybody's going insane.
[4143.04s -> 4150.89s]  Do the houses have to be livable?
[4150.89s -> 4153.64s]  No, no, that was not part of the criteria.
[4153.64s -> 4159.36s]  It was just make the best house, the most interesting, the most just build,
[4159.36s -> 4162.91s]  build a house that you want to build.
[4162.91s -> 4164.99s]  Does anybody have an exterior wall yet?
[4164.99s -> 4166.43s]  Does anybody, are they all like this?
[4166.43s -> 4166.99s]  I'm going to laugh.
[4166.99s -> 4168.51s]  So don't tell me, I don't want to know.
[4168.51s -> 4171.39s]  Actually, don't tell me if every single person has a fucking exterior
[4171.39s -> 4173.23s]  that looks like this, I'm going to laugh my ass off.
[4173.23s -> 4174.11s]  Don't tell me.
[4174.19s -> 4176.35s]  I actually, I'm going to wait till chat like settles down
[4176.35s -> 4179.98s]  because I don't even want to look over here
[4179.98s -> 4184.56s]  because that is so goddamn funny if everybody has the exact same exterior.
[4184.56s -> 4188.64s]  The same exterior concrete like paint.
[4191.31s -> 4203.64s]  I can't look over at chat until it's safe.
[4203.64s -> 4205.88s]  Do you know who's going to get a lot of points?
[4205.88s -> 4208.68s]  Whoever has exterior paint on their house.
[4208.68s -> 4216.52s]  Can we get a quick recap of the rules?
[4216.52s -> 4217.16s]  Absolutely.
[4218.35s -> 4221.63s]  There are 10, there are 10 people here.
[4221.63s -> 4222.75s]  There are 10 streamers.
[4223.39s -> 4225.95s]  Each one started at the same time with this house.
[4226.67s -> 4228.11s]  This was all messed up.
[4228.11s -> 4229.39s]  The windows were all boarded up.
[4230.03s -> 4231.23s]  The lawn was all dirty.
[4231.23s -> 4232.59s]  There was trash everywhere.
[4232.59s -> 4234.19s]  Everybody started at the same time.
[4234.19s -> 4236.27s]  They all had 75 minutes at the same time.
[4236.27s -> 4237.31s]  One, two, three, go.
[4237.31s -> 4239.42s]  They're all streaming their perspectives.
[4239.42s -> 4242.94s]  They have to build the best house they can in that time limit.
[4242.94s -> 4246.00s]  Well, except Poke.
[4246.00s -> 4246.72s]  Yeah, except for Poke.
[4246.72s -> 4249.85s]  Poke was here later, but we're good.
[4249.85s -> 4250.97s]  Everybody's here now.
[4250.97s -> 4252.01s]  So we're good.
[4252.75s -> 4253.87s]  Everybody's building.
[4253.87s -> 4255.87s]  Everybody is currently intensely focused.
[4255.87s -> 4257.71s]  There's 16 minutes left.
[4257.71s -> 4261.02s]  We might come to a unanimous decision.
[4261.02s -> 4262.94s]  When everybody is like, I need more time.
[4262.94s -> 4263.58s]  I need more time.
[4263.58s -> 4265.98s]  If it's possible, we might get a unanimous decision
[4265.98s -> 4269.29s]  to add an extra like 15 to 20 minutes.
[4269.29s -> 4270.17s]  We might do that.
[4270.17s -> 4272.92s]  It's possible.
[4272.92s -> 4276.04s]  At the end of this, each person is going to individually give me
[4277.12s -> 4278.88s]  a one-on-one tour of their house.
[4279.44s -> 4280.96s]  So we have Discord here.
[4280.96s -> 4283.15s]  We are Discord.
[4283.15s -> 4286.75s]  I'm going to, they're going to share their Discord screen with the game.
[4286.75s -> 4289.23s]  And they're going to walk me through it one-on-one.
[4289.31s -> 4293.02s]  I'm going to, at the end of that, about five to seven minute tour.
[4293.02s -> 4295.34s]  I'm going to be grading them based on a few categories.
[4296.08s -> 4300.40s]  They're going to be graded on, and these are 100 through 60, the point system.
[4300.40s -> 4305.07s]  Nobody gets an F because we figured that's kind of mean considering if somebody,
[4305.07s -> 4305.79s]  you know what I mean?
[4305.79s -> 4307.07s]  I don't want to be mean to anybody.
[4307.07s -> 4309.55s]  So we got 100 point scale, 100 to 60.
[4311.56s -> 4313.48s]  60 is the lowest you can get, D minus.
[4313.48s -> 4317.47s]  So creativity is one of the categories.
[4317.47s -> 4321.10s]  Complexity and structure is a category.
[4321.10s -> 4324.12s]  Cleanliness is a category.
[4324.12s -> 4325.63s]  Philosophy.
[4325.63s -> 4327.87s]  What was your philosophy with this whole thing?
[4327.87s -> 4329.52s]  That's a category.
[4329.52s -> 4333.42s]  And then at the very end, you guys are going to get a grade too.
[4333.42s -> 4335.90s]  Your grade is worth 10% of the overall grade.
[4335.90s -> 4337.90s]  Creativity is worth 35%.
[4337.90s -> 4340.32s]  Complexity is worth 25%.
[4340.32s -> 4341.66s]  Cleanliness 15%.
[4342.97s -> 4345.85s]  Philosophy 15%, adding up to 100.
[4345.85s -> 4352.51s]  There you go.
[4352.51s -> 4355.61s]  Philosophy is the vibes, bro.
[4355.61s -> 4357.93s]  That's exactly, you got it exactly.
[4357.93s -> 4362.01s]  If you've got a fucked up house and you didn't do the walls right,
[4362.01s -> 4364.96s]  but man, the vibes are immaculate in here.
[4364.96s -> 4366.64s]  The philosophy was immaculate.
[4366.64s -> 4367.68s]  That's an A.
[4367.68s -> 4379.96s]  If nobody gets an F, doesn't that make D the new F?
[4379.96s -> 4384.64s]  Probably.
[4384.64s -> 4385.68s]  That's only 95%.
[4386.72s -> 4397.93s]  35% plus 25% is 35, 45, 55, 60, plus 15, plus 15, which is 60, 70, 80, 90, plus 10%,
[4397.93s -> 4400.20s]  which is your grade is 100.
[4400.20s -> 4402.44s]  Trust me, I spent a lot of time on this.
[4403.74s -> 4410.40s]  This grading system was, I sat there for at least 15 minutes.
[4410.40s -> 4412.72s]  No, it was actually at least, I actually spent time on this.
[4412.72s -> 4414.88s]  I wanted to make sure this went off like, okay.
[4414.88s -> 4422.08s]  So there was some time putting this.
[4422.08s -> 4424.40s]  Have an F, but just don't give it to anybody.
[4424.40s -> 4425.76s]  Stop wasting time.
[4425.76s -> 4432.08s]  I'm not being graded.
[4432.08s -> 4436.16s]  I am here merely as technical support and as a judge
[4436.16s -> 4440.33s]  and to help you along the way understand what I'm doing this for.
[4440.33s -> 4443.90s]  And the answer to that question is for absolutely no reason.
[4443.90s -> 4445.79s]  Nobody wins anything.
[4446.70s -> 4449.74s]  Uh, the grades don't give you anything.
[4449.74s -> 4451.98s]  There's no winner.
[4451.98s -> 4457.05s]  It's just get some people together and make some fun shit.
[4457.05s -> 4457.85s]  That's it.
[4457.85s -> 4462.54s]  You should just leave the call and play something else.
[4462.54s -> 4463.74s]  Just don't even grade anybody.
[4463.74s -> 4464.94s]  Just be like, all right, later.
[4464.94s -> 4475.55s]  Turn my stream off and just like delete the tweet.
[4475.55s -> 4477.95s]  Every streamer right now is puking blood with stress.
[4488.83s -> 4494.91s]  Intense rust.
[4494.91s -> 4498.70s]  I hope, I hope all the cheats were enabled for everybody
[4498.70s -> 4500.54s]  because it actually would be very hard.
[4500.54s -> 4503.26s]  The reason why the timer is okay where it is
[4503.26s -> 4511.88s]  is because everybody should have all the tools unlocked and fully upgraded.
[4511.88s -> 4515.32s]  Because what you are watching, I do not have the tools upgraded.
[4515.32s -> 4521.26s]  Will there be a winner's build off after?
[4522.60s -> 4523.88s]  I didn't really think that far.
[4524.44s -> 4525.96s]  If I'll be really honest with you.
[4525.96s -> 4529.88s]  Just trying to get more than five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten people
[4529.88s -> 4532.30s]  streaming at the same time was probably the hardest part.
[4533.48s -> 4536.04s]  If you guys like this, if after this, this is over
[4536.04s -> 4537.88s]  and we do all the tours and everyone has a great time,
[4537.88s -> 4539.72s]  then why the fuck I would do it again?
[4539.72s -> 4542.41s]  A hundred percent get different streamers, different people.
[4542.41s -> 4544.17s]  This is just like people that I know.
[4545.44s -> 4548.00s]  I obviously would love to open it up to more streamers
[4548.00s -> 4549.36s]  and more content creators and stuff.
[4549.36s -> 4550.48s]  That would be a lot of fun.
[4550.48s -> 4556.76s]  There were a couple of people that I reached out to that couldn't do it
[4556.76s -> 4559.16s]  that I would love to see what they would do.
[4559.16s -> 4565.85s]  There are a couple, there are two or three people that are not here.
[4565.85s -> 4571.66s]  So I would love to see what they do.
[4571.66s -> 4573.34s]  Expand the torture.
[4573.34s -> 4588.76s]  And also to like, I want to like,
[4589.64s -> 4591.32s]  obviously include as many people as I can.
[4592.65s -> 4596.17s]  But I think I told you this yesterday, the day before.
[4596.17s -> 4600.56s]  I'm actually pretty, I'm not that well connected on Twitch,
[4600.56s -> 4602.56s]  on YouTube as much as maybe some of you might think I am.
[4603.42s -> 4607.24s]  But I would love to open this up to just have more people for sure.
[4607.24s -> 4617.60s]  Should I just do the whole house this yellow?
[4617.60s -> 4619.92s]  We're getting, it's getting down to 10 minutes remaining here.
[4628.70s -> 4630.38s]  It might be time to change the music.
[4630.38s -> 4634.03s]  All right, let's get, let's change the music.
[4634.03s -> 4638.84s]  What would be Hell's Kitchen?
[4642.03s -> 4643.39s]  Like music?
[4643.39s -> 4661.93s]  Ten streamers had exactly 75 minutes to build a house in House Flipper.
[4662.01s -> 4665.13s]  Unfortunately, only one of them will get the golden jacket.
[4666.01s -> 4671.37s]  We've seen some drama tonight too, as Poke showed up 25 minutes late.
[4671.37s -> 4674.62s]  This is where the part where Poke is in the chair and he's like,
[4674.62s -> 4676.86s]  I didn't, I was at the aquarium and I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[4676.86s -> 4678.94s]  I, I, I got a beep on my phone.
[4678.94s -> 4680.54s]  I had to get there and I got there pretty fast.
[4681.26s -> 4686.86s]  But what we don't understand here is what was happening over on Natalix's stream.
[4686.86s -> 4689.74s]  And like it shows him just like fucking smashing his fucking desk.
[4690.30s -> 4693.88s]  I'm not doing this anymore.
[4694.52s -> 4696.40s]  I'm not doing this anymore, Jerma.
[4704.19s -> 4705.23s]  Who's getting eliminated?
[4711.69s -> 4712.33s]  Nine minutes.
[4720.43s -> 4722.75s]  Where's the re-sounds?
[4723.47s -> 4724.27s]  Oh, that's true.
[4724.27s -> 4725.07s]  They should be here now.
[4727.87s -> 4728.59s]  Yeah, where are they?
[4733.20s -> 4736.30s]  Eight minutes before we get everybody in here to ask
[4736.30s -> 4739.74s]  the very important question of how are we going to handle this?
[4742.17s -> 4743.37s]  You should add sound effects.
[4744.01s -> 4754.99s]  I like, all right, I'm going to get up like the violin sound.
[4756.09s -> 4758.25s]  Okay, I know what I'm doing for the next 10 minutes.
[4758.25s -> 4759.29s]  Give me a second.
[4759.29s -> 4790.73s]  Okay, I got that one.
[4790.73s -> 4791.85s]  I got the theme song.
[4806.00s -> 4807.60s]  Am I going to do this forever?
[4807.60s -> 4810.80s]  This, there's 10 tours I have to do.
[4810.80s -> 4812.00s]  I don't, I can't do this forever.
[4812.00s -> 4813.36s]  Okay, I'll do it for every single one.
[4813.36s -> 4815.56s]  I'll do it for every single one.
[4816.30s -> 4817.66s]  At least the first like three.
[4817.66s -> 4823.80s]  We've got seven minutes.
[4823.80s -> 4827.20s]  Poke is the only one with a little extra time, but that's all right.
[4827.20s -> 4829.04s]  We do have a schedule of who's going when.
[4830.86s -> 4832.62s]  We're going to have to move the schedule a little
[4832.62s -> 4835.58s]  because Poke was scheduled for 3.20.
[4835.58s -> 4838.54s]  But I think we're going to have to move Poke
[4838.54s -> 4841.26s]  because Poke's still going to be, actually, might still make it.
[4841.26s -> 4845.44s]  I think he must, this might still be fine.
[4845.44s -> 4855.48s]  Okay, any other Hell's Kitchen sound effect?
[4855.48s -> 4856.68s]  How many sound effects are there?
[4857.61s -> 4858.65s]  Violin?
[4858.65s -> 4859.45s]  Isn't this the same thing?
[4860.01s -> 4863.87s]  It's the same sound, right?
[4863.87s -> 4870.64s]  Yeah, it's the same sound.
[4870.64s -> 4879.45s]  There's only one sound effect.
[4879.45s -> 4882.25s]  Just put Gordon Ramsay yelling at somebody in the background too.
[4882.25s -> 4882.97s]  No, that's too much.
[4885.56s -> 4886.76s]  Need a boom?
[4886.76s -> 4887.88s]  I need like a boom effect?
[4903.42s -> 4904.78s]  Oh, it's this one.
[4907.02s -> 4907.74s]  How loud is this?
[4909.39s -> 4910.51s]  This is so fucking loud.
[4910.51s -> 4911.95s]  I have to turn this way down.
[4911.95s -> 4919.71s]  This is at like 0.0 percent.
[4926.30s -> 4929.58s]  Five minutes, almost at the five minute timer.
[4930.83s -> 4935.31s]  Five minutes, five minutes.
[4935.31s -> 4938.94s]  All right, how loud is this?
[4938.94s -> 4942.75s]  Let's see.
[4942.75s -> 4943.71s]  Careful, this might be loud.
[4943.71s -> 4945.23s]  I'm just trying to get it through where I can.
[4945.23s -> 4948.41s]  That's really, it's not.
[4948.41s -> 4949.98s]  This one, all right, that's good.
[4949.98s -> 4950.62s]  Right there is good.
[4951.26s -> 4954.78s]  All right, let's get them all together.
[4955.34s -> 4963.26s]  So show me what you got here, Talix.
[4963.26s -> 4965.58s]  Well, see, I'm over here and this is my bathroom.
[4965.58s -> 4969.16s]  The bathroom.
[4969.96s -> 4971.80s]  Don't you think it's a little dirty, don't you think?
[4979.92s -> 4981.84s]  They're not, they're not going to be able to hear that.
[4981.84s -> 4991.72s]  The boom is too quiet.
[4991.72s -> 5000.84s]  We have less than five minutes remaining.
[5000.84s -> 5003.16s]  All right, I got to get my, so there you go.
[5003.16s -> 5004.36s]  I'm going to get everything ready.
[5004.36s -> 5006.68s]  Let me make sure I have my camera set up, everything set up
[5006.68s -> 5009.88s]  because I'm going to have to be doing through sharing screens
[5009.88s -> 5010.60s]  and let me get that set
[5010.60s -> 5011.80s]  because I want to be able to get right into it.
[5011.80s -> 5013.76s]  So give me one second.
[5013.76s -> 5014.96s]  I will be back.
[5014.96s -> 5018.08s]  You're going to see the screen is going to go black
[5018.08s -> 5059.68s]  and then you'll, I'll be back.
[5059.68s -> 5061.04s]  I think, I actually think I'm good.
[5061.04s -> 5063.98s]  I think I'm ready.
[5063.98s -> 5065.18s]  The question is, is everybody?
[5065.18s -> 5066.06s]  So we're okay.
[5066.06s -> 5068.35s]  Let me just warn everybody here.
[5068.35s -> 5069.79s]  This is a really important warning.
[5070.78s -> 5073.42s]  They're all going to get unmuted at the same time
[5073.42s -> 5075.50s]  and everyone's going to be probably complaining
[5075.50s -> 5077.18s]  and like yelling at me and saying like,
[5077.18s -> 5078.62s]  hey, do this, I needed more time.
[5078.62s -> 5080.62s]  Like, hey, dude, my house sucks or like, fuck you.
[5081.34s -> 5083.10s]  There's going to be a lot of fighting, I think.
[5083.10s -> 5087.05s]  So just be ready for everyone to unmute at the same time.
[5087.05s -> 5092.01s]  It's going to be hell on earth here.
[5092.01s -> 5095.58s]  Who do you think makes the first complaint?
[5095.58s -> 5096.54s]  Who complains first?
[5097.34s -> 5101.69s]  I think that's a good idea to figure that out.
[5101.69s -> 5104.57s]  Who is immediately the first person that we hear
[5105.77s -> 5117.77s]  being very mad at me or very upset?
[5117.77s -> 5120.33s]  Give minus 10 points to the person that complains first.
[5123.56s -> 5126.91s]  We have to be very, very attentive to this.
[5126.91s -> 5130.70s]  Minus five points to the person that complains first.
[5130.70s -> 5132.62s]  And not just like, oh, wow, that was so hard.
[5132.62s -> 5135.71s]  I mean like an audible like, like this was annoying.
[5135.71s -> 5136.19s]  You know what I mean?
[5136.19s -> 5149.79s]  Like an audible complaint.
[5149.79s -> 5151.55s]  There has to be some care and shit.
[5151.55s -> 5153.82s]  Yeah. Oh yeah.
[5153.82s -> 5155.58s]  Don't, and don't give it away either.
[5155.58s -> 5158.97s]  I was going to put it as far as they're great.
[5159.96s -> 5162.52s]  Minus five points from philosophy because of that.
[5162.52s -> 5163.93s]  That's right.
[5163.93s -> 5164.89s]  See, you get it.
[5164.89s -> 5165.69s]  You get it.
[5165.69s -> 5172.49s]  You understand now.
[5172.49s -> 5174.89s]  One minute is on the clock.
[5175.61s -> 5181.93s]  Now, I'm going to wait to play this
[5181.93s -> 5183.29s]  because I want this to play while everyone's freaking out
[5183.29s -> 5194.62s]  and yelling at me.
[5194.62s -> 5195.98s]  Final 60 seconds.
[5195.98s -> 5196.70s]  Here it comes.
[5198.59s -> 5199.23s]  Count it down.
[5211.87s -> 5213.60s]  What did you say?
[5213.60s -> 5215.84s]  Get the clock ticking sound from 24.
[5217.68s -> 5218.08s]  All right.
[5218.08s -> 5219.04s]  Here we go.
[5219.04s -> 5222.24s]  We got to tell everybody pencils down.
[5222.24s -> 5224.56s]  And if you're in their chats, tell them to.
[5224.56s -> 5226.24s]  When I start saying this, tell them to.
[5227.04s -> 5229.04s]  We're going on the honor system here besides poke.
[5229.04s -> 5233.07s]  Poke is the only one that gets a little extra time.
[5233.07s -> 5234.19s]  So do not do this to poke.
[5234.19s -> 5238.57s]  But everybody else is on the honor system.
[5238.57s -> 5239.69s]  We got 15 seconds.
[5239.69s -> 5240.09s]  Here we go.
[5244.43s -> 5247.23s]  Who's cuisine reigns supreme?
[5247.23s -> 5249.47s]  We will find out very shortly.
[5249.47s -> 5258.14s]  God, that hurts my head.
[5258.14s -> 5259.02s]  I didn't know it did that.
[5261.52s -> 5262.72s]  Stop. What's going on?
[5262.72s -> 5263.28s]  Who's doing that?
[5264.16s -> 5266.96s]  I'm being like electrocuted.
[5267.60s -> 5270.20s]  Is pencils down?
[5270.20s -> 5270.76s]  Pencils down.
[5270.76s -> 5271.40s]  Pencils down.
[5271.40s -> 5273.24s]  Oh, we're doing that in the discord to tell everybody.
[5273.24s -> 5273.72s]  All right.
[5273.72s -> 5274.52s]  Pencils are down.
[5274.52s -> 5275.24s]  Pencils are down.
[5275.24s -> 5275.88s]  Pencils are down.
[5275.88s -> 5276.76s]  Pencils are down.
[5276.76s -> 5280.56s]  I've never been more stressed in my entire life.
[5280.56s -> 5281.20s]  Me too, man.
[5284.92s -> 5286.44s]  This is fucked, Jerma.
[5286.44s -> 5292.60s]  I got to say, I didn't realize how quick 75 minutes was.
[5292.60s -> 5293.24s]  It is pretty quick.
[5293.24s -> 5295.16s]  It sounded so long during the prep.
[5295.16s -> 5296.92s]  I was like, that's like 10 minutes per room.
[5296.92s -> 5298.52s]  It's like 30 minutes per room.
[5298.52s -> 5300.76s]  From learning the game while doing it.
[5300.76s -> 5301.16s]  Hold on.
[5301.16s -> 5301.48s]  Hold on.
[5301.48s -> 5301.80s]  Hold on.
[5304.04s -> 5305.24s]  So poke is still going.
[5305.24s -> 5308.44s]  Poke has been given special time because poke showed up
[5308.44s -> 5309.24s]  30 minutes late.
[5310.38s -> 5312.22s]  So poke is still building right now.
[5312.22s -> 5313.34s]  He's got about 20 minutes left.
[5314.54s -> 5317.71s]  Let me let me let's let's ask the group.
[5317.71s -> 5318.67s]  How are you all doing?
[5318.67s -> 5323.24s]  Do you guys want an extra 10 to 15 minutes?
[5323.24s -> 5324.12s]  So good.
[5324.12s -> 5325.88s]  I'll take an extra five.
[5325.88s -> 5328.68s]  Well, poke you are poke you have like an extra almost 25 minutes.
[5330.41s -> 5330.89s]  Yeah, you're good.
[5330.89s -> 5333.05s]  Use a little bit of time.
[5333.05s -> 5336.70s]  No, just to put those final touches on just to make sure it's just right.
[5336.70s -> 5340.62s]  I would actually like no extra time because I think everybody else
[5340.62s -> 5346.08s]  has messed up and I don't think five minutes will help me.
[5346.08s -> 5347.12s]  I need like 45.
[5349.68s -> 5353.66s]  So I selfishly I selfishly think that the people.
[5353.66s -> 5355.66s]  Yeah, some people could use five to 10.
[5355.66s -> 5356.22s]  I couldn't.
[5356.22s -> 5359.42s]  I need three hours to be held back by the baddies.
[5360.22s -> 5360.94s]  Yes.
[5360.94s -> 5363.90s]  Is it OK if I like went over by two minutes?
[5363.90s -> 5364.94s]  No, definitely not.
[5366.22s -> 5367.10s]  That's minus 10.
[5367.10s -> 5368.14s]  No, it's not allowed.
[5368.14s -> 5368.78s]  Poke poke.
[5368.78s -> 5371.55s]  If I put German, what if I put your dog in it?
[5371.55s -> 5373.45s]  Will that give me two points back?
[5373.45s -> 5377.28s]  I just want time to finish the shrine, you know?
[5377.28s -> 5377.84s]  Oh, yeah.
[5377.84s -> 5380.96s]  Well, you know, 75 minutes is 75 minutes.
[5380.96s -> 5382.08s]  We had the confines of the time.
[5382.08s -> 5384.16s]  We should play within the time allocated to us.
[5384.16s -> 5386.75s]  You have to remain at the confines of the tortilla.
[5386.75s -> 5387.23s]  That's correct.
[5387.23s -> 5389.55s]  The only thing is poke poke poke you poke.
[5389.55s -> 5392.03s]  You should get out of here because you have like an extra 20 minutes to build.
[5392.03s -> 5392.52s]  All right.
[5392.52s -> 5393.72s]  I mean, I'm down to take the L.
[5396.46s -> 5397.42s]  You just want to take the L.
[5398.54s -> 5400.70s]  I mean, I'm not going to lose, but I mean, I can take the L.
[5401.42s -> 5401.66s]  All right.
[5401.66s -> 5402.86s]  You're certainly going to lose.
[5402.94s -> 5403.80s]  There's no take.
[5403.80s -> 5404.44s]  You'll see, man.
[5404.44s -> 5406.49s]  I got some crazy design.
[5406.49s -> 5406.89s]  All right.
[5406.89s -> 5407.21s]  All right.
[5407.21s -> 5407.53s]  All right.
[5407.53s -> 5409.13s]  Like minus two, minus two.
[5409.13s -> 5411.13s]  You get were you guys as stressed as I was?
[5411.13s -> 5411.69s]  Did you ask?
[5411.69s -> 5414.01s]  Oh, yeah, I was miserable day of my life.
[5414.01s -> 5415.29s]  Yeah, miserable.
[5415.29s -> 5416.25s]  God damn.
[5416.25s -> 5417.34s]  It's not easy.
[5417.34s -> 5418.46s]  So I'm really happy.
[5418.46s -> 5420.06s]  Everybody had a really good time.
[5420.06s -> 5421.34s]  I'm really glad to hear that.
[5421.34s -> 5422.14s]  That's not what we said.
[5422.14s -> 5422.86s]  Great times.
[5422.86s -> 5423.50s]  So thank you.
[5423.50s -> 5424.38s]  Thank you.
[5424.38s -> 5425.90s]  Everybody thought it was fun.
[5426.54s -> 5426.78s]  All right.
[5426.78s -> 5427.42s]  So here we go.
[5427.42s -> 5428.30s]  So how's it going to start?
[5428.30s -> 5429.50s]  We're going to go to you.
[5429.50s -> 5431.18s]  You all should have the times.
[5431.18s -> 5433.58s]  You feel free to stick around if you want to watch.
[5434.54s -> 5436.30s]  We did some discord testing.
[5436.30s -> 5437.18s]  I am curious.
[5437.18s -> 5439.18s]  So feel free to watch.
[5439.18s -> 5444.22s]  But the only thing is it will only be me and the other person in a one on one in this call.
[5444.22s -> 5446.80s]  But feel free to react to it and watch what other people did.
[5446.80s -> 5449.60s]  So the first one, Joel, it is you.
[5449.60s -> 5454.84s]  So, Joel, if you would if you could turn on your your screen on discord.
[5457.31s -> 5457.87s]  You see this?
[5457.87s -> 5462.67s]  Also, if someone needs to go earlier, I'm feeling a little bit better than this morning.
[5462.67s -> 5467.52s]  So I can swap if someone needs to get out of here faster.
[5467.76s -> 5469.90s]  We can figure that out in due time for sure.
[5469.90s -> 5473.02s]  If anybody wants to swap with italics where he is currently.
[5473.02s -> 5474.86s]  I'm chilling.
[5474.86s -> 5475.42s]  Okay.
[5475.42s -> 5476.14s]  Yeah.
[5476.14s -> 5476.38s]  All right.
[5476.38s -> 5479.34s]  So let me get out of this because I need to be able to capture this.
[5479.34s -> 5480.78s]  So let's get this started.
[5480.78s -> 5482.70s]  So we have about five to seven minutes.
[5482.70s -> 5483.74s]  The times aren't going to be exact.
[5483.74s -> 5485.90s]  I just don't want to I gave us a time constraint
[5485.90s -> 5488.54s]  because I don't want the people at the end of this to be waiting around for like two hours.
[5488.54s -> 5489.74s]  So let's get started.
[5489.74s -> 5490.62s]  Joel, you ready?
[5490.62s -> 5492.38s]  I am going to open yours up.
[5492.38s -> 5494.62s]  I have your audio through here, too, just to let you know.
[5494.62s -> 5498.17s]  So if you're going to play any loud sound effects, let me do this first.
[5498.17s -> 5500.65s]  Probably a good idea to quick save for everyone.
[5500.65s -> 5501.37s]  It is.
[5501.37s -> 5502.57s]  How do you how do you do that?
[5502.57s -> 5504.01s]  Yeah, I'll do you quick.
[5504.01s -> 5506.72s]  All that for Joel.
[5506.72s -> 5509.44s]  Oh, no, don't don't do that.
[5509.44s -> 5513.80s]  Don't do that.
[5513.80s -> 5515.32s]  How do you actually quick save it?
[5518.78s -> 5522.20s]  Okay, we are ready, Joel.
[5522.20s -> 5523.64s]  Hold on one more second.
[5523.64s -> 5525.96s]  I want to make sure I can see everything that you're doing.
[5525.96s -> 5528.43s]  I'm going to try to go to German stream chat.
[5530.09s -> 5530.33s]  Okay.
[5530.33s -> 5532.01s]  So this is Joel's view.
[5533.08s -> 5533.64s]  Yes.
[5533.72s -> 5535.88s]  Let me make sure I can see your whole entire thing.
[5538.44s -> 5539.00s]  Hold on.
[5539.00s -> 5540.60s]  I got to get it in the frame.
[5540.60s -> 5543.47s]  Okay.
[5543.47s -> 5543.95s]  Hold on.
[5548.96s -> 5551.44s]  Let me just exit my game so I can hear this better.
[5551.44s -> 5552.88s]  I can get rid of the timer as well.
[5557.00s -> 5558.68s]  I can hear like somebody swearing.
[5559.72s -> 5561.00s]  No, don't worry about that.
[5561.00s -> 5561.80s]  Don't worry about that.
[5561.80s -> 5562.04s]  No.
[5564.03s -> 5565.15s]  Okay, move this.
[5566.03s -> 5567.31s]  I'm going to get out of my game.
[5568.73s -> 5569.13s]  Okay.
[5570.30s -> 5570.62s]  Okay.
[5571.58s -> 5572.38s]  You can begin.
[5573.18s -> 5574.38s]  You can begin your tour.
[5575.44s -> 5576.40s]  I am here and I'm ready.
[5577.20s -> 5577.92s]  Okay, Jeremiah.
[5577.92s -> 5581.68s]  So the extensive cleanup that I did of this.
[5581.68s -> 5582.88s]  First of all, before we go into the house,
[5582.88s -> 5586.56s]  I'm going to make sure that you see all of my nice cleanup that I did.
[5586.56s -> 5587.52s]  There's no trash.
[5587.52s -> 5588.88s]  There's nothing going on here.
[5588.88s -> 5589.12s]  Okay.
[5589.12s -> 5591.68s]  And as you can see, it's all pretty damn good.
[5591.68s -> 5594.25s]  You know, and don't worry about that, but whatever.
[5594.25s -> 5598.49s]  So my point is I did a lot here to make sure this was going to be percentable and good.
[5598.49s -> 5601.85s]  Now, first thing you're going to see is a crime scene yellow tape.
[5602.65s -> 5603.29s]  That doesn't matter.
[5603.29s -> 5605.53s]  Joel, could you just stand still for one second?
[5605.53s -> 5609.28s]  Because the bit rate, your bit rate is phenomenal.
[5609.28s -> 5610.00s]  Oh, really?
[5610.00s -> 5610.16s]  Yeah.
[5610.16s -> 5613.60s]  Well, you're going to have to go to each room and freeze for like five seconds.
[5613.60s -> 5613.92s]  Okay.
[5613.92s -> 5614.24s]  Okay.
[5614.24s -> 5614.72s]  Okay.
[5614.72s -> 5616.32s]  But everything could lower the FPS too.
[5616.32s -> 5617.76s]  That can help sometimes.
[5617.76s -> 5621.16s]  If you're like running native, the bit rate kind of suffers.
[5621.16s -> 5623.08s]  So a lower FPS streaming helps.
[5629.45s -> 5630.81s]  You can always just watch my stream.
[5630.81s -> 5634.01s]  I'm also streaming on my channel if you want to pull that up too.
[5634.01s -> 5637.23s]  But this is one to one so I can actually react with you.
[5637.23s -> 5638.91s]  I think it's actually good now.
[5638.91s -> 5639.15s]  All right.
[5639.15s -> 5639.87s]  Did you make a change?
[5639.87s -> 5640.94s]  Good.
[5640.94s -> 5642.46s]  No, it's all the same.
[5642.46s -> 5643.10s]  Oh, okay.
[5643.10s -> 5643.90s]  I think it looks all right.
[5643.90s -> 5644.70s]  Okay.
[5644.70s -> 5645.10s]  Okay.
[5645.10s -> 5645.90s]  You ready?
[5645.90s -> 5647.24s]  I'm ready.
[5647.24s -> 5647.80s]  Okay.
[5647.80s -> 5650.36s]  So you see the yellow tape that says crime scene do not cross.
[5650.36s -> 5651.32s]  Don't worry about it.
[5651.32s -> 5651.88s]  Okay.
[5651.88s -> 5655.32s]  Now, what I did here is I made sure that even though my house is floss,
[5655.32s -> 5658.83s]  I made sure to point them out to kind of get a bit of a, you know,
[5658.83s -> 5661.87s]  like be aware there are some issues here since a trip password in here.
[5661.87s -> 5662.27s]  Sure.
[5662.27s -> 5664.11s]  Now, as you watch the bathroom here,
[5664.11s -> 5668.19s]  I did an interior decorating here that shows that I got a sense of humor
[5668.19s -> 5671.56s]  in the, you know, face of terror.
[5671.64s -> 5674.76s]  So I didn't install a toilet, but I installed a hole here instead.
[5674.76s -> 5675.08s]  Okay.
[5675.08s -> 5676.60s]  Or a bucket if you prefer.
[5676.60s -> 5681.39s]  I installed a poop knife for the willing and a plate of brownies.
[5681.39s -> 5684.51s]  Now, if you might notice, there's a picture of William the foe looking at you.
[5684.51s -> 5686.75s]  Yeah, I was going to ask you about that.
[5686.75s -> 5691.50s]  There's only to encourage, you know, fecal content.
[5691.50s -> 5697.02s]  But as you can see, yes to that, no to that, you know, be careful, be aware.
[5697.02s -> 5701.42s]  So that on the right, that's somebody defecating is what I'm being,
[5701.42s -> 5704.22s]  is that what that is?
[5704.22s -> 5706.08s]  No, it's art.
[5706.08s -> 5710.16s]  Anyway, anyway, that's a bathroom and it's a big window out here,
[5710.16s -> 5713.66s]  but you own this entire area, so it should be fine.
[5713.66s -> 5717.66s]  Anyway, that's a bathroom, you know, and in here,
[5717.66s -> 5720.46s]  I made it make sure to do a little thematic thing here.
[5720.46s -> 5723.02s]  As you can see, there's an alien in here and you go in here
[5723.02s -> 5725.10s]  and you notice, wow, there's a lot of going on.
[5725.10s -> 5727.20s]  There's a bit of a sci-fi theme.
[5727.20s -> 5728.16s]  There's a UFO in the ceiling.
[5728.16s -> 5729.28s]  Sci-fi theme.
[5730.46s -> 5734.81s]  Yes, but check this out.
[5734.81s -> 5735.53s]  Oh, all right.
[5735.53s -> 5736.65s]  I like it.
[5736.65s -> 5738.81s]  I like the, I like the radio.
[5738.81s -> 5739.76s]  Yeah.
[5739.76s -> 5740.64s]  What is on the radio?
[5740.64s -> 5741.52s]  I don't like aliens.
[5741.52s -> 5743.69s]  I don't like aliens.
[5743.69s -> 5746.25s]  So, you know, say no to alien abduction.
[5746.25s -> 5747.85s]  There's a little cow being abducted.
[5747.85s -> 5749.37s]  There's some corn for the alien.
[5749.37s -> 5752.72s]  And as you can see here, there's the guy from Toy Story, Gary.
[5754.12s -> 5758.41s]  And you know, I got a little Gleeby Deeby guy and a toilet too.
[5758.41s -> 5761.77s]  But this is going to be playing throughout your house tour
[5761.77s -> 5762.81s]  and going to irritate you.
[5763.37s -> 5768.48s]  So I'm basically telling you that if you're impervious to migraines,
[5768.48s -> 5769.12s]  this is great.
[5769.12s -> 5771.36s]  But if you're not, then, you know, whatever.
[5771.36s -> 5773.52s]  But anyway, that's just the bottom floor here.
[5773.52s -> 5775.12s]  Now, I want to guide you out of here
[5775.12s -> 5777.69s]  because I have something very, very good for you.
[5777.69s -> 5779.60s]  Now, there's two options here.
[5779.60s -> 5785.68s]  You can check out the Amazing Maze or the hidden Green Gobbler Room.
[5785.68s -> 5790.24s]  Can we, can we go to the PlayStation 1 Green Gobbler Room?
[5790.24s -> 5790.88s]  You got it.
[5790.88s -> 5792.08s]  There's the Green Gobbler.
[5792.08s -> 5794.97s]  And as you can see, picture Willem Dafoe.
[5794.97s -> 5795.85s]  You go in here.
[5795.85s -> 5796.17s]  Whoa!
[5796.17s -> 5799.12s]  There's a little shrine dedicated to the man.
[5799.12s -> 5803.60s]  So as you all heard, Jerma Chat, Willem, William.
[5805.07s -> 5806.03s]  It's, oh, fuck, I fucked up.
[5806.03s -> 5807.07s]  It was supposed to be Willem.
[5808.59s -> 5811.71s]  Is that, what is, is that, is that Jack Nicholson up there?
[5811.71s -> 5813.15s]  No, that's Willem Dafoe.
[5813.15s -> 5814.59s]  Anyway, he died this year.
[5814.59s -> 5816.75s]  And I want to make sure that everybody remembers.
[5816.75s -> 5818.11s]  He died of gas.
[5818.11s -> 5820.89s]  So over here, there's the poisonous gas storage
[5820.89s -> 5823.21s]  where Willem Dafoe was turned into the Green Goblin.
[5824.41s -> 5829.40s]  There's an air conditioning unit here that lets you smoke the gas
[5829.40s -> 5832.12s]  to turn into Spider-Man.
[5833.63s -> 5836.03s]  You and I, we're not too different, Spider-Man.
[5836.59s -> 5838.19s]  I'm putting down a complexity grade here.
[5840.19s -> 5843.60s]  What I enjoy, let me stop you for one second.
[5843.60s -> 5847.60s]  I do very much enjoy the Green Goblin room.
[5847.60s -> 5849.28s]  I think it was a very good creative choice.
[5850.08s -> 5852.56s]  What I'm very, I think I'm upset with here is the fact
[5852.56s -> 5854.32s]  that that's Jack Nicholson's picture up there,
[5854.32s -> 5856.24s]  not actually Willem Dafoe.
[5856.24s -> 5858.16s]  And over on the right there, that's,
[5858.72s -> 5860.32s]  can you get in close to that, please?
[5860.32s -> 5860.96s]  Yeah, that picture there.
[5860.96s -> 5861.20s]  This?
[5861.20s -> 5861.60s]  Yeah.
[5861.60s -> 5863.44s]  Just get in real close and just stand still for a second
[5863.44s -> 5864.80s]  because I want people to be able to see this
[5864.80s -> 5866.24s]  as it offers a little bit here.
[5866.89s -> 5868.81s]  Yeah, that's, I'm going to give you a little bit of points
[5868.81s -> 5870.33s]  deducted from that because this is one of my least
[5870.33s -> 5871.69s]  favorite images on the internet.
[5871.69s -> 5873.77s]  So I'm going to deduct a few points for you from that one
[5873.77s -> 5876.01s]  for your philosophy.
[5877.79s -> 5878.91s]  I do like the vision.
[5878.91s -> 5880.19s]  I'm a big fan of the vision.
[5880.19s -> 5887.13s]  Anyway, we've seen it.
[5888.28s -> 5889.08s]  I'll take it.
[5889.08s -> 5892.16s]  So you can see here, there's the gas from there.
[5892.16s -> 5893.84s]  And once you've ingested the gas,
[5895.20s -> 5896.96s]  the mask starts talking to you
[5896.96s -> 5899.34s]  and you can stand in front of the mirror and it goes,
[5899.34s -> 5900.86s]  you know, Spider-Man.
[5902.24s -> 5906.70s]  So the entire green goblin room.
[5906.70s -> 5907.42s]  Yeah.
[5907.42s -> 5909.55s]  All right.
[5909.55s -> 5913.04s]  I think it's how much more of your house is there?
[5913.04s -> 5914.40s]  Uh, a little bit.
[5914.40s -> 5915.60s]  There's just two areas left.
[5915.60s -> 5915.84s]  Okay.
[5915.84s -> 5916.64s]  Quickly show off.
[5917.44s -> 5918.56s]  So that's a green gobbler.
[5919.20s -> 5919.68s]  I like it.
[5919.68s -> 5920.88s]  Want to show this off?
[5920.88s -> 5923.21s]  Put a little reference to, uh,
[5925.29s -> 5926.25s]  I don't have any.
[5926.25s -> 5927.53s]  Please don't deduct points.
[5927.53s -> 5930.73s]  I don't, I don't know what it is.
[5930.73s -> 5934.81s]  The pixels are trying so hard to put that image on the screen.
[5935.37s -> 5935.77s]  It looks.
[5936.41s -> 5936.73s]  Whoa.
[5936.73s -> 5938.33s]  That just like actually scared me.
[5938.33s -> 5939.61s]  There's another person behind me.
[5942.14s -> 5943.34s]  Can I interrupt real quick?
[5943.34s -> 5946.56s]  If we made it daytime, it probably would have helped.
[5947.52s -> 5948.00s]  That's true.
[5948.00s -> 5949.04s]  How do I do that?
[5949.04s -> 5951.68s]  Uh, if you exit and reenter, yes, leave it a bed.
[5951.68s -> 5952.96s]  I don't have a bed.
[5952.96s -> 5956.72s]  I think it's also because you are technically sharing from, uh,
[5956.72s -> 5957.68s]  from across the world.
[5957.68s -> 5961.34s]  I think that's another reason, but we know we can see it.
[5961.34s -> 5963.63s]  Burnt post maybe.
[5964.27s -> 5964.75s]  Okay.
[5964.75s -> 5965.55s]  Just checking.
[5965.55s -> 5968.19s]  Can we just listen to the audio for a second?
[5968.19s -> 5969.07s]  I just, can I get just into,
[5969.79s -> 5973.15s]  this is going to be a part of your grade because philosophy,
[5973.15s -> 5975.69s]  um, yeah, I want to turn your volume up.
[5975.69s -> 5977.13s]  I want to hear that.
[5977.13s -> 5991.55s]  Listening to that.
[5991.55s -> 5992.51s]  I think I got it.
[5992.51s -> 5993.23s]  Yeah, I got it.
[5993.23s -> 5993.79s]  Okay.
[5993.79s -> 5994.99s]  Anyway, quick thing here.
[5994.99s -> 5996.11s]  We had some problems.
[5996.11s -> 5999.71s]  Uh, somebody died, but it's okay because, you know, life and death
[5999.71s -> 6001.15s]  is kind of synonymous with each other.
[6002.27s -> 6004.35s]  And through death, life comes.
[6004.35s -> 6006.35s]  So we're growing corn here from it.
[6006.35s -> 6008.27s]  Oh, a garden actually garden.
[6008.67s -> 6009.07s]  Okay.
[6009.95s -> 6010.43s]  Yes.
[6010.43s -> 6011.87s]  And we, it's also solar powered.
[6011.87s -> 6014.64s]  So it's, you know, it's environmentally.
[6014.64s -> 6015.28s]  Healthy.
[6015.28s -> 6015.60s]  Okay.
[6015.60s -> 6018.56s]  But anyway, speaking of gardens, I made sure to include a little
[6018.56s -> 6020.56s]  puzzle because we all like mind puzzles, right?
[6021.28s -> 6023.12s]  So here's the amazing thing.
[6023.12s -> 6023.28s]  All right.
[6023.28s -> 6024.88s]  Wait, wait, can you, can you actually sleep?
[6024.88s -> 6026.40s]  Can you like reset your game?
[6026.40s -> 6028.16s]  Like just go to a different house and come back to this one.
[6028.16s -> 6028.40s]  All right.
[6028.40s -> 6030.80s]  So just go to back to your office and then come back to this house.
[6030.80s -> 6032.08s]  Make this your office.
[6032.08s -> 6033.37s]  Make office here.
[6033.37s -> 6036.83s]  No, yeah, make, make this your office.
[6036.83s -> 6037.15s]  Yeah.
[6037.15s -> 6038.19s]  Move office here.
[6038.19s -> 6038.43s]  Yep.
[6038.43s -> 6039.82s]  Move office here.
[6039.82s -> 6040.14s]  Okay.
[6040.14s -> 6041.63s]  Put the computer down.
[6041.63s -> 6043.23s]  Now go just leave here and come back.
[6043.23s -> 6046.03s]  Because I think we'll fix some of the vision problems that way.
[6046.03s -> 6047.77s]  Main menu.
[6047.77s -> 6048.09s]  Yep.
[6048.09s -> 6052.16s]  Just, and just come right back in or just like, yeah, just go to the computer.
[6052.16s -> 6052.32s]  Yeah.
[6053.12s -> 6053.68s]  Just reload it.
[6053.68s -> 6054.96s]  Reload it and then continue game.
[6054.96s -> 6055.20s]  Yeah.
[6055.20s -> 6056.24s]  You should be good to go.
[6056.24s -> 6056.83s]  Okay.
[6056.83s -> 6057.07s]  Okay.
[6057.07s -> 6057.23s]  Okay.
[6057.23s -> 6057.63s]  Gotcha.
[6057.63s -> 6057.79s]  Gotcha.
[6057.79s -> 6059.31s]  Gotcha.
[6059.31s -> 6059.95s]  Don't worry chat.
[6059.95s -> 6061.61s]  I made sure to save.
[6061.61s -> 6066.65s]  Well, also you could on Joel's stream too, has like the HQ high quality version.
[6066.65s -> 6070.88s]  So I can still get, I can still see what you're doing.
[6070.88s -> 6074.33s]  Watch the game crash now.
[6076.33s -> 6077.32s]  No, we're good.
[6077.96s -> 6078.12s]  All right.
[6078.12s -> 6079.96s]  So back over here.
[6079.96s -> 6080.28s]  Okay.
[6080.28s -> 6084.04s]  As you can see, laptop, the statement you missed, kind of.
[6085.18s -> 6087.34s]  I can, I can, I see, I see the, I see the vision.
[6087.34s -> 6087.98s]  I see the vision.
[6088.62s -> 6088.86s]  Okay.
[6088.86s -> 6089.50s]  Cool.
[6089.50s -> 6090.54s]  So we're going to move on here.
[6091.50s -> 6094.22s]  And this is the, this is the amazing maze, by the way, right?
[6095.02s -> 6097.90s]  It's all the grass, but I, you know, I'm going to open your stream.
[6098.78s -> 6099.18s]  Okay.
[6099.18s -> 6099.82s]  Yeah.
[6099.82s -> 6103.37s]  And you're like, my God, I have solved the maze.
[6104.01s -> 6104.25s]  Okay.
[6104.25s -> 6106.65s]  Jerma, Jerma, this is for you, buddy.
[6106.65s -> 6108.73s]  Cause I know someone has a special day coming up.
[6109.37s -> 6110.41s]  You've solved the maze.
[6110.41s -> 6116.25s]  You've done the brain puzzle and ladies and gentlemen, happy birthday, Jeremy, happy 60th.
[6116.97s -> 6118.49s]  We are so proud of you, buddy.
[6120.52s -> 6122.28s]  Hey, have a racing cake.
[6122.28s -> 6122.76s]  Thank you.
[6123.48s -> 6126.97s]  It is my birthday in months and months from now.
[6126.97s -> 6129.40s]  I really appreciate it.
[6129.40s -> 6129.96s]  That's right.
[6130.60s -> 6131.32s]  Oh, that's it.
[6131.32s -> 6134.36s]  And that's not how tall I am, but you're getting points removed for creativity for that one.
[6134.36s -> 6139.08s]  Because the short joke is I think, well, 60th birthday, well on its way out by now.
[6140.70s -> 6142.14s]  We are so proud of you.
[6142.14s -> 6147.92s]  But anyway, yeah, this is a little maze that leads to your personal pleasure zone.
[6148.48s -> 6148.72s]  Okay.
[6149.52s -> 6149.76s]  All right.
[6149.76s -> 6151.52s]  Wait, wait, wait, go, go back to the table for a second.
[6153.39s -> 6154.35s]  And what, what is this?
[6154.35s -> 6155.39s]  This is a, this is a cake.
[6155.95s -> 6157.76s]  This is a little racing cake, buddy.
[6158.32s -> 6159.44s]  You like racing cakes.
[6160.08s -> 6160.40s]  Okay.
[6161.21s -> 6165.53s]  I actually, I'm going to, I'm going to pull you back a few points on,
[6166.91s -> 6168.91s]  I'm going to pull you back a few points on philosophy on this one,
[6168.91s -> 6170.91s]  because I actually don't really like raisins that much at all.
[6172.73s -> 6174.73s]  So that's, that's a blunder.
[6174.73s -> 6176.49s]  You like the spider though, right?
[6176.49s -> 6179.29s]  The spider is cool, but the raisins, I'm not a, I'm not a big fan of raisins.
[6179.29s -> 6181.13s]  Well, thanks for reinstating all my points, buddy.
[6181.13s -> 6184.22s]  You're my friend.
[6184.22s -> 6188.06s]  I cannot wait to go back and watch you do this.
[6188.06s -> 6188.38s]  Okay.
[6189.26s -> 6191.26s]  So we have a final area here.
[6191.26s -> 6192.06s]  Wait, there's another area.
[6192.06s -> 6192.30s]  Okay.
[6192.30s -> 6192.62s]  All right.
[6192.62s -> 6192.86s]  Yeah.
[6192.86s -> 6193.18s]  More, more, more.
[6193.18s -> 6198.80s]  There's a final area here that I want to show off, because Jerma, you like Twister?
[6199.68s -> 6201.28s]  You know, timeless game, right?
[6201.28s -> 6201.92s]  Twister, which game?
[6201.92s -> 6203.36s]  Do you like wall Twister?
[6203.36s -> 6203.76s]  Yeah.
[6203.76s -> 6205.04s]  I guess it would, yeah.
[6205.04s -> 6207.36s]  You figure this shit out because I ran out of time.
[6207.36s -> 6209.90s]  Anyway, as you can see, look at that.
[6209.90s -> 6211.85s]  Otto!
[6211.85s -> 6213.21s]  That's right.
[6213.21s -> 6215.93s]  Please give me 10 points for being so caring as a friend.
[6215.93s -> 6219.21s]  Anybody that has Otto in their house gets an extra two or three points,
[6219.21s -> 6221.13s]  at least on every category.
[6221.13s -> 6222.33s]  That's right.
[6222.33s -> 6225.37s]  And I put some Bop-Its in because, you know, I'm sure you like Bop-Its.
[6225.37s -> 6227.26s]  These are real Bop-Its, by the way.
[6227.26s -> 6227.98s]  What is to the right?
[6227.98s -> 6228.46s]  What is down there?
[6228.46s -> 6229.82s]  Is that like an air conditioner?
[6230.62s -> 6235.15s]  That's a printer because we all like to print shit.
[6235.15s -> 6236.75s]  You know what's wicked funny?
[6236.75s -> 6239.15s]  My printer's actually on the ground like that.
[6239.15s -> 6241.39s]  And you get points, you get points for creativity for that one.
[6241.39s -> 6241.95s]  All right.
[6241.95s -> 6244.83s]  My printer is actually on the ground just like that.
[6244.83s -> 6246.12s]  OK.
[6246.12s -> 6246.92s]  Now, I could prove it.
[6246.92s -> 6247.00s]  Check this out.
[6247.00s -> 6248.06s]  There's a bunch of spi...
[6248.06s -> 6248.86s]  Oh, oh my God.
[6248.86s -> 6249.58s]  OK, there we go.
[6249.58s -> 6252.06s]  A bunch of spiders in the ceiling, but don't worry.
[6252.06s -> 6254.86s]  The spider infestation problem is mostly resolved.
[6256.06s -> 6258.86s]  Cleanliness.
[6258.86s -> 6260.38s]  Well, don't worry about that, Jerma,
[6260.38s -> 6262.06s]  because we're about to go a little meta here.
[6262.06s -> 6262.76s]  OK?
[6262.76s -> 6263.08s]  Ready?
[6264.12s -> 6268.08s]  Ladies and gentlemen, beware of the Boggler.
[6268.08s -> 6270.57s]  And there's a little star reference there.
[6271.13s -> 6271.93s]  So, you know.
[6271.93s -> 6272.81s]  He's not here.
[6272.81s -> 6277.23s]  Doesn't matter because, Jerma, it's your streamer room.
[6279.20s -> 6281.28s]  You got your reddish shelf over here.
[6281.28s -> 6282.56s]  You know, check that out.
[6282.56s -> 6283.36s]  You got your whole thing.
[6283.36s -> 6285.68s]  You're eating a chicken egg, a tomato.
[6285.68s -> 6288.32s]  And you love that kefir.
[6288.32s -> 6288.72s]  Sorry.
[6288.72s -> 6289.12s]  Sorry, dude.
[6289.12s -> 6289.60s]  Tomatoes.
[6289.60s -> 6289.92s]  I'm sorry.
[6289.92s -> 6290.16s]  That's...
[6290.88s -> 6292.08s]  Yeah, but whatever.
[6292.08s -> 6292.48s]  That's fine.
[6292.48s -> 6293.28s]  But check this out.
[6294.56s -> 6295.84s]  It's nice milk.
[6295.84s -> 6297.44s]  And there's a big milk bucket.
[6297.44s -> 6300.56s]  And as you can see on the floor, it's infested with rats.
[6300.56s -> 6301.92s]  Friendly rats, mind you.
[6301.92s -> 6303.04s]  OK, they look...
[6303.04s -> 6303.44s]  That's cool.
[6303.44s -> 6304.00s]  What's that poster?
[6304.00s -> 6306.16s]  Can you get in close and just re-sperm it on there for a second?
[6306.16s -> 6306.96s]  This is the...
[6306.96s -> 6307.92s]  This is the flavors.
[6307.92s -> 6308.72s]  What's your flavor?
[6309.68s -> 6310.56s]  You are a gamer.
[6310.56s -> 6312.32s]  So, you like Seeds of Victory.
[6313.20s -> 6314.48s]  Cashews of Chaos.
[6314.48s -> 6315.20s]  Cashews, no.
[6315.20s -> 6316.72s]  Nuts of Destruction.
[6316.72s -> 6318.32s]  Definitely not cashews, for sure.
[6318.32s -> 6319.72s]  What's that one?
[6319.72s -> 6321.15s]  Gamer snacks?
[6321.15s -> 6322.59s]  Gourmet trail mix.
[6322.59s -> 6324.89s]  I actually don't eat very many gamer snacks,
[6324.89s -> 6326.73s]  but I do appreciate the fact that you're trying to make people...
[6326.73s -> 6327.69s]  Like and subscribe.
[6328.88s -> 6329.92s]  Well, you can't do that on Twitch.
[6329.92s -> 6332.48s]  And I pretty much only predominantly use Twitch.
[6332.48s -> 6334.40s]  And that's minus points for complexity
[6334.40s -> 6337.44s]  because my spine looked a little weird there.
[6337.44s -> 6340.32s]  Try to get your room right then.
[6340.32s -> 6341.60s]  It's a one-one recreation.
[6342.24s -> 6346.83s]  Now, we are on to the last room here of the tour, everybody.
[6346.83s -> 6349.63s]  So, I wanted to have a theme, various themes here.
[6349.63s -> 6352.83s]  And one of them was an OSHA violation.
[6352.83s -> 6355.95s]  So, as you can see, OSHA top 10 violations.
[6355.95s -> 6358.01s]  We're going to be cooking guns
[6358.01s -> 6359.61s]  and we're going to be using a sink here
[6360.17s -> 6362.73s]  and enjoy this sink drink.
[6362.73s -> 6367.05s]  Are those plenty of sharpies?
[6367.05s -> 6367.85s]  What's on the ground?
[6367.85s -> 6369.48s]  What's all over the ground?
[6369.48s -> 6370.60s]  Are those propane tanks?
[6371.40s -> 6372.20s]  Explosives?
[6372.20s -> 6373.64s]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[6373.64s -> 6374.89s]  Okay.
[6374.89s -> 6375.77s]  Well, as you can see,
[6376.57s -> 6377.77s]  there's some accidents here,
[6377.77s -> 6379.61s]  but we've got shotguns.
[6379.61s -> 6380.97s]  There's a toxic hazard.
[6380.97s -> 6383.37s]  There's a chocolate and eggs being cooked up too.
[6383.37s -> 6384.09s]  Chocolate and eggs.
[6384.09s -> 6384.81s]  And here's where it gets...
[6384.81s -> 6386.51s]  Yeah, it's good.
[6386.51s -> 6387.79s]  But here's where it gets interesting
[6387.79s -> 6389.95s]  because there's not only explosives,
[6389.95s -> 6390.67s]  it's radioactive.
[6390.67s -> 6391.55s]  It's radioactive.
[6391.55s -> 6394.19s]  And to really sell this house home,
[6394.19s -> 6395.71s]  Jeremiah, I just want to tell you one thing.
[6396.35s -> 6399.23s]  What's better than a baby with a gun
[6399.23s -> 6402.03s]  and peace near a fireplace with explosives?
[6402.03s -> 6405.90s]  I think there are quite a few things
[6405.90s -> 6407.34s]  that would be better than that.
[6407.58s -> 6410.46s]  I think philosophy might have to take
[6410.46s -> 6413.02s]  a little bit of a nosedive on this one
[6413.02s -> 6414.78s]  just because that's very dangerous.
[6415.42s -> 6417.58s]  And there's also somebody's
[6417.58s -> 6419.34s]  severed limb over there as well, I believe.
[6419.34s -> 6421.37s]  Is that somebody?
[6421.37s -> 6422.01s]  It's good, right?
[6424.41s -> 6425.69s]  I mean, if it's dangerous,
[6425.69s -> 6426.81s]  I don't know if good would be the answer,
[6426.81s -> 6428.49s]  but dangerous is definitely up there.
[6428.49s -> 6429.85s]  But you could put points for creativity.
[6429.85s -> 6431.29s]  Dangerously fun.
[6431.29s -> 6432.25s]  I see.
[6432.25s -> 6432.73s]  I'm feeling you.
[6432.73s -> 6433.90s]  I feel you.
[6433.90s -> 6434.38s]  Okay.
[6434.38s -> 6437.95s]  I think I'm ready to grade you.
[6437.95s -> 6438.43s]  Okay.
[6438.43s -> 6440.16s]  I think I'm ready.
[6440.16s -> 6440.56s]  Remember.
[6441.36s -> 6442.54s]  Remember.
[6442.54s -> 6442.86s]  Remember.
[6442.86s -> 6444.54s]  Happy 60th.
[6444.54s -> 6446.97s]  We are going to go for creativity.
[6446.97s -> 6448.97s]  Joel, I think you actually did a lot.
[6448.97s -> 6451.61s]  There was a lot of time and placement
[6451.61s -> 6453.08s]  that went into this.
[6453.08s -> 6456.92s]  I'm going to give you, for creativity,
[6456.92s -> 6459.45s]  I'm going to give you,
[6459.45s -> 6461.13s]  because of the amount of objects
[6461.13s -> 6462.09s]  that you placed,
[6462.09s -> 6464.57s]  the amount of individual objects
[6464.57s -> 6465.53s]  that had to be physically placed,
[6465.53s -> 6470.27s]  you're going to get a 94 for your creativity.
[6470.27s -> 6471.04s]  Okay.
[6471.04s -> 6472.96s]  94 for creativity.
[6472.96s -> 6474.40s]  I think you actually did quite a lot.
[6475.71s -> 6477.23s]  I think it was very, very wonderful.
[6477.23s -> 6478.83s]  I think you did a lot of good placement.
[6479.15s -> 6479.79s]  I love the corn.
[6479.79s -> 6481.15s]  I like the fact that you actually did a garden.
[6481.79s -> 6484.27s]  Your complexity is also going to be a little bit high
[6484.27s -> 6485.55s]  because your complexity is in...
[6487.23s -> 6489.39s]  There was a full thought-out maze
[6489.39s -> 6490.35s]  part of this house,
[6490.91s -> 6492.43s]  which gives you some points.
[6493.32s -> 6494.68s]  The complexity of, you know,
[6494.68s -> 6496.44s]  Jerma's not as tall as his door,
[6496.44s -> 6497.96s]  I mean, and like, you know,
[6497.96s -> 6500.52s]  Green Goblin, it's not that complex.
[6501.48s -> 6502.28s]  I do appreciate the fact
[6502.28s -> 6503.80s]  that you did put a gnome next to that
[6503.80s -> 6505.32s]  to be able to show that I am, in fact,
[6505.32s -> 6507.80s]  over, you know, more than four feet tall.
[6507.80s -> 6508.76s]  That's unrelated.
[6509.40s -> 6510.20s]  This is unrelated.
[6510.20s -> 6511.56s]  And if you feel that way,
[6511.56s -> 6513.24s]  that's not deductible on points.
[6513.24s -> 6514.52s]  I'm going to give you an 80.
[6514.52s -> 6515.48s]  I'm going to give you an 82
[6516.04s -> 6518.30s]  on complexity and structure.
[6518.30s -> 6519.26s]  I think it was still good.
[6520.57s -> 6521.77s]  I think you get an 82 on that.
[6521.77s -> 6522.57s]  That's a solid B.
[6522.57s -> 6524.01s]  That's a solid B minus.
[6524.57s -> 6527.16s]  Your cleanliness was very good.
[6527.16s -> 6528.20s]  I don't see any trash in the yard.
[6528.20s -> 6529.08s]  Could you do me a quick favor, though?
[6529.08s -> 6530.28s]  Could you go to where the...
[6531.71s -> 6532.59s]  Go to where the...
[6532.59s -> 6533.31s]  Where's the garage?
[6535.56s -> 6537.08s]  Like the actual garage.
[6537.08s -> 6538.92s]  Yeah, I need like the garage
[6538.92s -> 6540.44s]  because I need you to go to the left of the garage.
[6540.52s -> 6541.56s]  No, actually, no, that's clear.
[6541.56s -> 6542.06s]  That's clear.
[6543.07s -> 6544.83s]  The spiders are going to take some points off,
[6544.83s -> 6546.35s]  unfortunately, because it's, you know,
[6547.39s -> 6548.83s]  you didn't clean that up beforehand.
[6548.83s -> 6552.27s]  Also, I think that having explosives everywhere
[6552.27s -> 6554.19s]  could be very dangerous and make a big mess.
[6554.19s -> 6557.05s]  I'm going to have to give you a 75 on cleanliness.
[6557.05s -> 6557.55s]  Okay.
[6558.49s -> 6559.61s]  I think that's a solid C,
[6559.61s -> 6561.13s]  considering that there were spiders everywhere.
[6561.13s -> 6562.76s]  There were rats everywhere.
[6562.76s -> 6564.76s]  It's not very clean, necessarily.
[6564.76s -> 6566.04s]  I mean, it's pretty complex.
[6566.04s -> 6567.16s]  It's pretty creative.
[6567.16s -> 6569.16s]  But I'm going to give you a 75 on cleanliness.
[6569.16s -> 6571.36s]  I'll take that.
[6571.36s -> 6572.48s]  Your philosophy and theming,
[6573.28s -> 6576.08s]  I'm going to give you an 86.
[6576.08s -> 6578.67s]  I think you deserve an 86.
[6578.67s -> 6580.35s]  I think that was a solid B.
[6581.36s -> 6583.31s]  Well, I'll give you...
[6583.31s -> 6585.39s]  I'm going to give you a 90, actually,
[6585.39s -> 6588.03s]  because you did have a pretty good theme here.
[6588.03s -> 6590.83s]  As much as I, you know, the Green Goblin,
[6590.83s -> 6591.47s]  you had a pretty good theme.
[6592.03s -> 6593.31s]  All right, it's time for Chat's grade.
[6594.83s -> 6596.43s]  Chat, what is your grade?
[6597.16s -> 6597.96s]  You have to pick...
[6598.76s -> 6602.60s]  It has to be 95, 85, 75, 65.
[6604.03s -> 6605.15s]  Those are your choices.
[6606.24s -> 6607.36s]  Joel, I think you did a hell of a job.
[6607.92s -> 6609.52s]  Those of you that opened up Joel's stream
[6609.52s -> 6611.04s]  would have seen the high quality version.
[6611.04s -> 6612.96s]  We got to see a good PlayStation 2 version,
[6612.96s -> 6614.16s]  which I think actually added to it.
[6614.16s -> 6616.88s]  So that's why I gave you more points for creativity.
[6616.88s -> 6619.95s]  And I think we can see what they want to do.
[6619.95s -> 6620.99s]  Can we get the poll going?
[6624.72s -> 6629.21s]  Adding your own audio track is a huge deal.
[6630.57s -> 6632.97s]  Your own audio track in the game?
[6632.97s -> 6634.41s]  That's how you got a 94 on creativity.
[6635.82s -> 6638.57s]  What do we got?
[6638.57s -> 6641.40s]  What does Chat want to give you?
[6641.40s -> 6643.32s]  Wow, Chat is saying A.
[6643.40s -> 6645.32s]  95 from Chat for Joel.
[6646.25s -> 6648.01s]  Joel, that brings your total grade.
[6648.01s -> 6650.32s]  That is worth 10% of your total grade.
[6650.32s -> 6654.96s]  Joel, you are at an 87.6 is your final grade.
[6654.96s -> 6656.16s]  That's a B plus.
[6656.16s -> 6659.53s]  Okay.
[6659.53s -> 6661.37s]  That's a B plus for Joel.
[6661.37s -> 6662.94s]  Okay.
[6662.94s -> 6665.34s]  87.6 for Joel.
[6665.34s -> 6667.26s]  I just want to let you all know
[6667.26s -> 6669.58s]  that I'm very happy to be part of this,
[6670.46s -> 6673.58s]  you know, opportunity to show off
[6673.58s -> 6675.58s]  and not necessarily show off
[6675.58s -> 6679.18s]  in a sort of, you know, narcissistic way,
[6679.18s -> 6681.18s]  but rather, you know, show everybody
[6681.18s -> 6683.10s]  that my hard drive is running out of space
[6683.74s -> 6685.98s]  for some reason anyway, whatever.
[6685.98s -> 6689.58s]  My point is I worked really hard on this
[6689.58s -> 6694.67s]  and I think it's pretty good according to you guys,
[6694.67s -> 6695.95s]  which makes me very happy.
[6696.59s -> 6699.47s]  But this was my little attempt at making a house here
[6699.47s -> 6702.67s]  and I can't wait to see what everybody else has done
[6702.67s -> 6704.35s]  because I mean, there's so many people,
[6704.35s -> 6706.03s]  there's so many talented people
[6706.51s -> 6707.47s]  and I guarantee you this,
[6709.66s -> 6711.34s]  if you think mine is the best,
[6711.34s -> 6713.26s]  that's not going to be the case because, you know.
[6713.26s -> 6715.16s]  Well, we'll see.
[6715.16s -> 6715.96s]  Yeah, we'll see.
[6715.96s -> 6716.84s]  We'll see.
[6716.84s -> 6718.68s]  But I just want to thank you all for, you know,
[6718.68s -> 6719.80s]  looking at my house
[6719.80s -> 6722.70s]  and I want to thank the Boogler himself
[6722.70s -> 6724.76s]  for giving such a high, high ranking.
[6724.76s -> 6728.60s]  Honestly, the lower bit rate actually added to it for me.
[6728.60s -> 6729.64s]  It really did.
[6729.64s -> 6732.46s]  Oh yeah.
[6732.46s -> 6733.42s]  Thanks a lot, Joel.
[6733.42s -> 6734.30s]  Joel, it was a pleasure.
[6735.50s -> 6736.62s]  Thank you for showing your house.
[6736.62s -> 6737.74s]  It was phenomenal.
[6737.74s -> 6739.10s]  Everybody say thank you to Joel.
[6740.22s -> 6741.74s]  I hope you had fun.
[6741.74s -> 6742.46s]  Thank you, guys.
[6742.46s -> 6743.18s]  Coming up, we have...
[6744.30s -> 6745.34s]  Yeah, but if we want to talk,
[6745.34s -> 6747.34s]  if anybody want to say anything about Joel's house
[6747.34s -> 6748.46s]  before we move on to Seedog.
[6750.49s -> 6752.97s]  Is anyone else going to get the points benefit
[6752.97s -> 6755.85s]  for PS2 graphics in the Discord preview?
[6757.71s -> 6760.11s]  His house is perfect for the PS2 graphics though.
[6760.11s -> 6760.75s]  It really is.
[6760.75s -> 6762.27s]  It couldn't have worked better.
[6762.27s -> 6763.23s]  I think that's why...
[6764.36s -> 6765.24s]  Walls?
[6765.24s -> 6765.88s]  Wait, what do you say?
[6767.23s -> 6767.87s]  Nothing.
[6767.87s -> 6770.51s]  I just spent most of my time painting the outside of my house
[6770.51s -> 6772.35s]  and I realized I should have just put in...
[6772.35s -> 6773.63s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[6773.63s -> 6774.67s]  Lud, Lud, Lud, I...
[6776.03s -> 6776.99s]  I'm a stupid idiot.
[6776.99s -> 6778.11s]  I'm a stupid idiot.
[6778.11s -> 6778.83s]  Lud, listen.
[6778.83s -> 6780.83s]  I used the paint gun and I grappled too, Connor.
[6780.83s -> 6781.63s]  I had to grapple.
[6781.63s -> 6782.59s]  He's so wrong.
[6782.59s -> 6783.47s]  He's such an idiot.
[6783.47s -> 6784.27s]  I'm such an idiot.
[6784.27s -> 6785.55s]  He doesn't know how wrong he is.
[6786.35s -> 6787.79s]  I should have hung spiders.
[6787.79s -> 6789.39s]  He doesn't know how wrong he is.
[6789.39s -> 6791.71s]  I don't have a single rat in my house.
[6794.19s -> 6794.67s]  Ludwig.
[6796.27s -> 6797.95s]  He had so many ill references.
[6797.95s -> 6798.91s]  It was so tight.
[6798.91s -> 6800.19s]  You're going to get so many more points
[6800.19s -> 6801.47s]  for painting the outside of your house
[6801.47s -> 6802.99s]  because it's your only fucking person that did it.
[6802.99s -> 6805.15s]  Just go check out Doug's house.
[6805.15s -> 6805.63s]  All right.
[6805.63s -> 6806.75s]  Seedog, you're up next.
[6806.75s -> 6808.38s]  Are you ready?
[6808.38s -> 6809.26s]  Oh, by the way,
[6809.26s -> 6811.42s]  we can change the quality here potentially.
[6811.42s -> 6813.34s]  Under your stream quality settings,
[6813.34s -> 6816.06s]  set stream quality to better text readability.
[6816.06s -> 6819.07s]  It might actually increase the bitrate.
[6819.07s -> 6820.43s]  Oh, is that on Discord?
[6820.43s -> 6821.31s]  I believe so.
[6821.31s -> 6822.67s]  And if you're streaming at the highest quality,
[6822.67s -> 6823.23s]  stream it at 30.
[6823.23s -> 6824.80s]  Is this Nitro?
[6824.80s -> 6825.04s]  This is...
[6825.04s -> 6825.92s]  Oh, it's a community server.
[6825.92s -> 6826.56s]  Everything's listed up.
[6827.76s -> 6829.28s]  We got HD streaming.
[6829.28s -> 6830.40s]  Yeah, so if we can do...
[6831.36s -> 6832.72s]  When you do your stream,
[6832.72s -> 6835.44s]  do it at 30 FPS rather than 60.
[6835.44s -> 6836.56s]  Try to go with the highest quality
[6836.56s -> 6838.24s]  and do that text readable thing at 30 FPS.
[6838.24s -> 6839.04s]  Should probably also have...
[6840.68s -> 6842.60s]  Who's the other person streaming in the Discord?
[6842.60s -> 6845.40s]  I can't see it because the dot-dot-dots.
[6845.40s -> 6847.00s]  Oh, just only have me do it?
[6847.00s -> 6849.02s]  Yeah.
[6849.02s -> 6850.94s]  So if you want to watch,
[6850.94s -> 6852.22s]  maybe open up the person's stream
[6852.22s -> 6853.18s]  that's currently doing it.
[6853.18s -> 6853.74s]  That makes sense.
[6853.74s -> 6855.82s]  I think just watching through JermaStream, yeah.
[6855.82s -> 6857.42s]  Yeah, that's probably the best way to do it.
[6857.42s -> 6858.44s]  Okay.
[6858.44s -> 6860.60s]  So Joel, you should turn your screen share off, Joel,
[6860.60s -> 6862.44s]  because we're moving on to Seedog.
[6862.44s -> 6863.82s]  So Seedog, did you...
[6864.70s -> 6866.22s]  Oh my God, I'm muted this whole time.
[6866.22s -> 6867.34s]  Oh my God, I'm an idiot.
[6867.34s -> 6868.30s]  Oh my God.
[6868.30s -> 6869.66s]  I was talking to you guys for like five minutes.
[6871.45s -> 6872.83s]  We heard you.
[6872.83s -> 6874.83s]  All right, are we ready to...
[6875.55s -> 6876.35s]  Can you see me?
[6876.35s -> 6877.44s]  I can.
[6877.44s -> 6877.84s]  Let me just make...
[6877.84s -> 6879.12s]  Let's make sure it actually looks okay first
[6879.12s -> 6879.68s]  before we move on.
[6879.68s -> 6880.16s]  Looks good, yeah.
[6880.16s -> 6881.28s]  Tell me how many P's is that?
[6881.28s -> 6881.68s]  Hey, it looks...
[6881.68s -> 6883.76s]  I was offering 101 of 100.
[6883.76s -> 6884.64s]  It actually looks...
[6884.64s -> 6885.60s]  It looks pretty good.
[6885.60s -> 6887.44s]  It actually looks good.
[6887.44s -> 6887.76s]  All right.
[6887.76s -> 6888.56s]  This looks great.
[6888.56s -> 6889.76s]  Okay.
[6891.64s -> 6893.56s]  So the Discord screen sharing
[6893.56s -> 6894.84s]  is kind of giving me a seizure,
[6894.84s -> 6895.48s]  but that's fine.
[6895.48s -> 6897.08s]  I can still do the tour and my chat doesn't see it.
[6897.08s -> 6898.04s]  So I'm fine to suffer.
[6898.04s -> 6898.36s]  Okay.
[6898.36s -> 6899.00s]  Are you sure?
[6899.00s -> 6900.28s]  Yeah, because it looks pretty good.
[6900.28s -> 6900.92s]  We're good.
[6900.92s -> 6902.84s]  Just bear in mind that I'm fighting that for you
[6902.84s -> 6903.72s]  when you're grading.
[6903.72s -> 6904.36s]  I got it.
[6904.36s -> 6904.76s]  I got you.
[6904.76s -> 6904.92s]  All right.
[6904.92s -> 6905.48s]  Are we ready?
[6905.48s -> 6906.20s]  How are you doing?
[6906.20s -> 6907.31s]  I'm doing good.
[6907.31s -> 6908.43s]  Do you want to see the outside first?
[6908.43s -> 6910.19s]  Is that where we normally start on these things?
[6910.19s -> 6910.51s]  Yeah.
[6910.51s -> 6911.47s]  You are free to give me the tour
[6911.47s -> 6913.04s]  however you'd like to.
[6913.04s -> 6913.36s]  All right.
[6913.36s -> 6914.08s]  So let's have a look.
[6914.08s -> 6916.00s]  Let's have a look how clean the garden is.
[6916.00s -> 6917.34s]  You know, we've...
[6917.34s -> 6919.74s]  I've gone for a minimalist approach with the garden.
[6920.78s -> 6924.17s]  By minimalist, you mean you removed everything?
[6924.17s -> 6926.65s]  Well, yeah, but that's what I thought it meant.
[6926.65s -> 6929.18s]  So you took cleanliness as
[6929.26s -> 6930.94s]  get rid of every single plant.
[6930.94s -> 6934.46s]  Well, yeah, because there's stuff that lives in dirt
[6934.46s -> 6936.22s]  that's dirty, like worms and stuff.
[6936.22s -> 6938.94s]  So I wanted to get rid of the grass that they would live in.
[6938.94s -> 6939.10s]  Okay.
[6939.10s -> 6939.90s]  All right.
[6939.90s -> 6940.46s]  Show me your process.
[6940.46s -> 6941.02s]  I left the trees
[6941.98s -> 6943.74s]  mainly because I couldn't burn them down.
[6943.74s -> 6944.62s]  Oh, I could have cut them.
[6944.62s -> 6945.58s]  I didn't really...
[6945.58s -> 6946.78s]  I left them intentionally.
[6947.50s -> 6949.56s]  So you tried to burn them down.
[6949.56s -> 6950.12s]  It didn't work.
[6950.12s -> 6950.36s]  Okay.
[6952.12s -> 6952.68s]  I get you.
[6952.68s -> 6954.52s]  I thought if God wanted them there,
[6954.52s -> 6956.72s]  the flamethrower surely would have kept them.
[6956.72s -> 6957.52s]  You know what I mean?
[6957.52s -> 6958.08s]  Here's the thing.
[6958.08s -> 6959.20s]  It is clean.
[6960.06s -> 6960.70s]  It is clean.
[6960.70s -> 6962.22s]  Very extremely clean.
[6962.46s -> 6963.98s]  Not a single weed around.
[6963.98s -> 6964.70s]  Very clean.
[6965.26s -> 6966.22s]  Exceptionally clean.
[6966.22s -> 6966.78s]  Even the back?
[6967.98s -> 6968.94s]  Not nothing.
[6968.94s -> 6969.58s]  Okay.
[6969.58s -> 6970.38s]  All right.
[6970.38s -> 6970.86s]  Okay.
[6970.86s -> 6973.50s]  There is some patches, but they just grew back over time.
[6973.50s -> 6975.42s]  I did actually get rid of these initially.
[6975.42s -> 6976.70s]  But this grew back.
[6977.56s -> 6979.08s]  This grew back in the time that you were doing?
[6979.08s -> 6979.32s]  Okay.
[6979.32s -> 6980.59s]  All right.
[6980.59s -> 6981.07s]  Yeah, it did.
[6981.07s -> 6981.79s]  It did.
[6981.79s -> 6982.27s]  Very clean.
[6982.27s -> 6983.74s]  Ignore the wall.
[6983.74s -> 6984.14s]  Yeah.
[6984.14s -> 6985.02s]  Looks all right.
[6985.02s -> 6988.57s]  I would have liked some shrubbery if it was possible.
[6988.57s -> 6989.93s]  I would have liked a little bit of...
[6989.93s -> 6991.05s]  I left this one in here.
[6993.20s -> 6994.64s]  Mainly because I couldn't remove it.
[6995.68s -> 6997.12s]  So I did leave that in.
[6997.12s -> 6998.69s]  Okay.
[7000.51s -> 7001.95s]  So are you ready for the tour?
[7001.95s -> 7003.39s]  I am ready for the tour.
[7004.43s -> 7006.91s]  I love how you're spending a lot of time in the outside.
[7008.43s -> 7012.14s]  What the fuck is happening here?
[7013.34s -> 7017.50s]  You've got the green M&M thinking about societal collapse and falls.
[7017.50s -> 7017.98s]  All right.
[7017.98s -> 7020.22s]  And I love how there's like the ad of the person
[7020.22s -> 7022.38s]  who actually like where you got that picture from.
[7022.38s -> 7023.26s]  So it's good credit.
[7023.26s -> 7024.22s]  You got credit there.
[7024.22s -> 7025.98s]  That's actually very thoughtful of you.
[7025.98s -> 7028.14s]  You can credit the artists here on this channel.
[7028.14s -> 7028.64s]  Okay.
[7029.02s -> 7031.98s]  We have an image of me pointing to the enter.
[7033.48s -> 7035.24s]  Oh, that's you at the entrance.
[7035.96s -> 7037.40s]  It's me in a maid outfit.
[7037.40s -> 7039.96s]  This happens a lot actually on my streams and content.
[7039.96s -> 7042.28s]  So I thought it would be a fun callback.
[7042.28s -> 7042.78s]  Okay.
[7045.80s -> 7046.68s]  I'm so sorry.
[7047.88s -> 7048.60s]  I have other...
[7051.31s -> 7056.28s]  So you actually you did an exterior.
[7056.28s -> 7057.56s]  I will give you credit for that.
[7057.56s -> 7059.64s]  You did a very elaborate exterior.
[7060.60s -> 7061.10s]  Yeah.
[7063.48s -> 7064.36s]  Sorry to interrupt you.
[7064.36s -> 7064.84s]  I didn't mean to.
[7064.84s -> 7065.40s]  I just wanted to...
[7065.40s -> 7066.36s]  Oh, no, it's your tour.
[7066.36s -> 7066.84s]  It's your tour.
[7066.84s -> 7067.88s]  Please give me your philosophy.
[7067.88s -> 7068.76s]  I need to hear it.
[7068.76s -> 7074.36s]  You are essentially the guy that we all are here to impress.
[7074.36s -> 7077.72s]  And I noticed that in a lot of my favorite countries,
[7077.72s -> 7081.48s]  they tend to have pictures of the guy in charge on walls.
[7081.48s -> 7084.28s]  So I thought, well, why don't I mimic that and have the,
[7084.28s -> 7087.64s]  you know, this is the biggest mural be of the guy in charge.
[7088.70s -> 7089.02s]  Right.
[7089.02s -> 7089.42s]  But you...
[7090.70s -> 7092.30s]  I'm going to give Doki a little bit of points on this
[7092.30s -> 7095.18s]  because you went less like Rembrandt painting
[7095.18s -> 7097.34s]  to show how interesting and amazing I look to
[7097.98s -> 7100.78s]  more like the guy melting at the end of Indiana Jones.
[7101.98s -> 7105.28s]  I think that's a little bit of a point deduction.
[7107.36s -> 7108.64s]  It was the first one that came up on Google.
[7109.20s -> 7109.92s]  What did you type?
[7114.20s -> 7116.12s]  What do you mean that's the first thing that came up on Google?
[7116.12s -> 7117.40s]  What did you type into Google?
[7120.14s -> 7121.82s]  It's the Japanese Google.
[7121.82s -> 7122.32s]  It's different.
[7123.02s -> 7124.14s]  It's a different Google.
[7124.14s -> 7124.70s]  All right.
[7124.70s -> 7125.02s]  Okay.
[7125.02s -> 7125.58s]  I'm feeling it.
[7126.38s -> 7127.98s]  If you tried it now, it wouldn't work.
[7127.98s -> 7129.77s]  Okay.
[7129.77s -> 7130.49s]  Okay.
[7130.49s -> 7130.73s]  All right.
[7130.73s -> 7132.14s]  So, okay.
[7132.14s -> 7133.18s]  So I will preface.
[7133.18s -> 7133.98s]  Actually, no, you know what?
[7133.98s -> 7134.22s]  I won't.
[7134.22s -> 7134.78s]  I won't preface.
[7134.78s -> 7135.34s]  I won't tell you.
[7137.63s -> 7137.95s]  Okay.
[7139.48s -> 7140.84s]  Having that dog in me.
[7142.40s -> 7142.72s]  Okay.
[7145.23s -> 7149.23s]  We blocked this off because I just didn't want it.
[7149.23s -> 7150.59s]  I was tired of doors.
[7150.59s -> 7151.05s]  What?
[7151.05s -> 7153.29s]  You didn't even put a door?
[7153.29s -> 7153.69s]  No, no, no.
[7153.69s -> 7154.33s]  There's a door.
[7155.45s -> 7155.69s]  Hold on.
[7155.69s -> 7156.25s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[7156.25s -> 7157.05s]  It's another door.
[7157.05s -> 7158.25s]  Can you get into the house?
[7159.39s -> 7164.52s]  That structural integrity is going to see you at least at a C right now.
[7164.52s -> 7165.40s]  Well, no, no, no, no, no.
[7165.40s -> 7166.44s]  You can get in the house.
[7166.44s -> 7167.16s]  You can get in the house.
[7167.16s -> 7168.20s]  Wait, you can get in the house?
[7168.20s -> 7168.76s]  Okay.
[7168.76s -> 7169.88s]  Of course you can get in the house.
[7169.88s -> 7172.04s]  What kind of asshole would I be if I made a house without doors?
[7172.04s -> 7172.44s]  True.
[7172.44s -> 7174.44s]  You know, I've been living in Japan now for a while,
[7175.26s -> 7177.50s]  and I've been concerned with earthquakes,
[7177.50s -> 7180.86s]  and I just thought that these doors here,
[7181.50s -> 7183.42s]  they were just a hazard waiting to happen.
[7183.42s -> 7184.62s]  So I blocked those off.
[7184.62s -> 7185.12s]  Okay.
[7185.90s -> 7186.94s]  I don't even know what this is.
[7186.94s -> 7188.06s]  I'll be honest with you.
[7189.02s -> 7190.38s]  I just put it up there.
[7190.38s -> 7190.62s]  Okay.
[7190.62s -> 7194.62s]  Was this like the first picture in like the folder of the meme folder you have on your desktop?
[7196.52s -> 7199.24s]  I asked the viewers because I didn't have time to get them.
[7199.80s -> 7201.08s]  I asked the views to send me memes,
[7201.08s -> 7202.52s]  and some of them aren't great.
[7202.52s -> 7203.40s]  Some of them aren't great.
[7203.40s -> 7206.94s]  Connor, Connor, you asked for memes?
[7207.96s -> 7213.56s]  Yeah, I didn't know we could put memes in the game until I got in.
[7213.56s -> 7214.12s]  It's true.
[7214.12s -> 7214.68s]  That's true.
[7214.68s -> 7215.72s]  I improvised.
[7215.72s -> 7216.81s]  That's true.
[7216.81s -> 7217.05s]  Okay.
[7217.05s -> 7219.05s]  But creativity is going to see a little bit of a hit on that one.
[7219.05s -> 7219.53s]  Just a little.
[7220.73s -> 7223.53s]  It's creative because I'm going beyond my means, right?
[7225.44s -> 7227.04s]  This is left by the previous contractor.
[7227.04s -> 7227.60s]  This isn't me.
[7228.72s -> 7231.84s]  Even though it's the color of the paint of the outside of the house, you didn't do that.
[7231.84s -> 7233.77s]  I didn't do it.
[7234.57s -> 7235.85s]  The contractor left it there.
[7235.85s -> 7236.17s]  Okay.
[7236.17s -> 7236.73s]  Got it.
[7236.73s -> 7236.97s]  I see.
[7236.97s -> 7237.37s]  We got you.
[7237.37s -> 7238.89s]  They leave stuff all the time.
[7239.85s -> 7240.49s]  Right.
[7240.49s -> 7242.94s]  So why are you laughing?
[7242.94s -> 7243.82s]  This is serious.
[7244.70s -> 7248.46s]  Because this is not even a house.
[7248.46s -> 7252.06s]  This is just walls with giant like pictures on them.
[7252.06s -> 7252.38s]  All right.
[7252.38s -> 7252.78s]  Let's go.
[7253.34s -> 7254.30s]  No, no, no.
[7256.20s -> 7257.96s]  This is so much more than that.
[7257.96s -> 7258.44s]  Okay.
[7258.44s -> 7258.60s]  All right.
[7258.60s -> 7258.92s]  I'll let you go.
[7258.92s -> 7259.80s]  What I have.
[7259.80s -> 7260.44s]  Okay.
[7260.44s -> 7264.99s]  First of all, I find that the concept...
[7264.99s -> 7265.15s]  Okay.
[7265.15s -> 7265.55s]  First of all.
[7265.55s -> 7265.87s]  All right.
[7270.76s -> 7271.08s]  Okay.
[7271.08s -> 7271.24s]  Wait.
[7271.24s -> 7275.85s]  Before you go any further, is there furniture in your house?
[7275.85s -> 7276.33s]  Yes.
[7276.33s -> 7276.65s]  Okay.
[7278.54s -> 7279.66s]  There actually is furniture.
[7279.66s -> 7280.06s]  There actually is.
[7280.06s -> 7280.30s]  All right.
[7280.30s -> 7280.46s]  Okay.
[7281.26s -> 7282.41s]  So let me...
[7282.41s -> 7284.57s]  Actually, I'm laughing too.
[7284.57s -> 7286.09s]  I can't present seriously.
[7287.05s -> 7293.96s]  So in the house, I decided that because you were talking about creativity,
[7293.96s -> 7295.24s]  you were talking about complexity,
[7295.24s -> 7298.28s]  I thought why not merge the two concepts into one
[7298.92s -> 7304.44s]  and take some kind of ideas from some of the properties that I enjoy.
[7304.44s -> 7310.52s]  So I decided that, okay, well, I'm a big fan of fun, elaborate mazes that kind of...
[7312.20s -> 7313.80s]  You think you're going the right way, but you're going the wrong way.
[7313.80s -> 7315.32s]  I mean, it's the whole point of a maze.
[7315.32s -> 7318.92s]  But I thought it would be fun because oftentimes in modern house design,
[7318.92s -> 7321.24s]  it's all about knocking the walls down.
[7321.24s -> 7327.08s]  I thought, no, why don't we put more walls, just so many walls,
[7327.08s -> 7328.76s]  that it's actually just inconvenient to live there.
[7328.76s -> 7331.56s]  But in fact, I did leave these here because I'm not a monster.
[7331.56s -> 7332.76s]  I want you to be able to charge your phone.
[7334.20s -> 7337.56s]  And then I decorated it with some pictures that I found.
[7337.56s -> 7338.36s]  Okay.
[7338.36s -> 7338.84s]  So...
[7338.84s -> 7343.40s]  So it's an anti-open concept room, an unopened room, you could say.
[7343.40s -> 7343.64s]  Okay.
[7344.60s -> 7347.72s]  So the whole house is a maze.
[7348.60s -> 7350.49s]  It's themed after kind of the back rooms.
[7350.49s -> 7352.41s]  Yeah, I painted the entire thing yellow.
[7352.41s -> 7355.29s]  Hold on, why is calm Nintendo music playing right now?
[7356.35s -> 7358.91s]  I thought you did that.
[7360.11s -> 7361.87s]  I was about to go, holy shit.
[7361.87s -> 7362.99s]  I was like, well, creative.
[7362.99s -> 7364.27s]  Wow, why don't we turn this corner?
[7364.27s -> 7365.79s]  You got your own audio like Joel.
[7365.79s -> 7367.79s]  I put that in actually.
[7371.18s -> 7374.30s]  Are you familiar with the brutalistic styles of Svavitch?
[7376.08s -> 7378.32s]  No, but let's continue.
[7378.32s -> 7380.72s]  So we're in the first hallway.
[7381.68s -> 7382.88s]  Yeah, where do you want to go in the maze?
[7382.88s -> 7384.16s]  Do you want to go forward or do you want to turn?
[7384.16s -> 7389.04s]  I would like to turn right because I see a little bit of a structural integrity
[7389.04s -> 7390.48s]  complexity issue up here.
[7390.48s -> 7391.28s]  What's going on here?
[7391.28s -> 7393.76s]  This is part of the frights.
[7393.76s -> 7394.48s]  I left this here.
[7395.47s -> 7397.15s]  That's intentional.
[7397.15s -> 7398.03s]  Yeah, I left this here.
[7398.03s -> 7401.15s]  I remodeled the entire floor.
[7401.15s -> 7402.67s]  I had to knock down all the walls.
[7402.67s -> 7403.71s]  I had to border off everything.
[7403.71s -> 7404.75s]  I got rid of all the windows.
[7404.75s -> 7405.79s]  They're all gone.
[7405.87s -> 7409.55s]  And I left this here as a kind of a keepsake of the previous owner,
[7409.55s -> 7411.23s]  who was kind enough to sell me this house.
[7412.03s -> 7413.15s]  I wanted to just have something.
[7413.15s -> 7414.99s]  Also, it's terrifying when you walk in because, you know,
[7414.99s -> 7417.31s]  the fact that you could scrape your head, boom, like that, you know.
[7417.31s -> 7419.79s]  I mean, I'm going to let you slide on that one
[7419.79s -> 7421.23s]  because that was an unbelievable bullshit.
[7421.23s -> 7422.11s]  That was unbelievable.
[7422.11s -> 7423.07s]  I'll let you slide on that one.
[7425.12s -> 7426.00s]  So you want to turn right?
[7426.00s -> 7426.88s]  I would like to turn right.
[7427.44s -> 7429.40s]  Would you like to keep progressing forward?
[7430.20s -> 7435.56s]  I would like to continue to go forward.
[7435.56s -> 7436.12s]  Yes, I would.
[7437.90s -> 7439.98s]  I would like you to stop and go back.
[7440.97s -> 7441.45s]  Okay.
[7441.45s -> 7445.53s]  I would like you to quickly explain what is going on with the wall on the left here.
[7445.53s -> 7446.83s]  Go like turn around.
[7448.03s -> 7448.83s]  What's happening on here?
[7448.83s -> 7451.93s]  This is a structural integrity complexity issue.
[7451.93s -> 7452.33s]  No, no.
[7452.33s -> 7456.70s]  So the, as you can see by the minimap, don't look at it too much there,
[7456.70s -> 7461.02s]  but it's just purely just here as you saw them.
[7462.22s -> 7464.22s]  I saw the minimap when you said that.
[7464.22s -> 7464.62s]  Okay.
[7464.62s -> 7464.94s]  All right.
[7464.94s -> 7467.48s]  I'll keep my mouth shut.
[7467.48s -> 7474.11s]  You can see that the entire design philosophy is to restrict the space.
[7475.31s -> 7479.07s]  All the time, everyone is talking about how much square footage.
[7479.07s -> 7481.87s]  No one's thought about how much square footage can I have
[7481.87s -> 7483.71s]  and how much can I make it useless.
[7483.71s -> 7489.07s]  So I think it's a fun concept to just start restricting space in an awkward way.
[7489.07s -> 7491.28s]  So now you can't even put anything here.
[7491.28s -> 7492.88s]  It's just inconvenient.
[7492.88s -> 7496.57s]  You're wondering why is that there?
[7496.57s -> 7498.49s]  I actually understand that.
[7498.49s -> 7498.97s]  I get it.
[7499.85s -> 7501.53s]  I'm just trying to get a little more of your video up.
[7501.53s -> 7502.33s]  There we go.
[7502.33s -> 7502.75s]  Yeah.
[7502.75s -> 7502.99s]  Okay.
[7502.99s -> 7505.79s]  So I would like you to turn around again.
[7505.79s -> 7506.88s]  Okay.
[7506.88s -> 7507.44s]  Over here?
[7507.44s -> 7508.80s]  I would like you to go straight.
[7508.80s -> 7510.04s]  Okay.
[7510.04s -> 7512.67s]  I would like for you to turn right at the end of this.
[7512.67s -> 7513.07s]  Okay.
[7513.07s -> 7513.39s]  Okay.
[7513.39s -> 7515.87s]  I would like you to go in this room and I'd like you to just...
[7516.59s -> 7517.07s]  Okay.
[7517.07s -> 7517.63s]  So this is...
[7518.27s -> 7519.37s]  What was this going to be?
[7519.93s -> 7521.13s]  I don't know.
[7521.13s -> 7522.09s]  This is the whole point.
[7522.09s -> 7524.51s]  It's just like to signal that you've gone the wrong way.
[7524.51s -> 7527.07s]  Oh, but you didn't put like a piece of cheese down on the ground.
[7527.07s -> 7528.59s]  Creativity points deducted by two.
[7530.24s -> 7531.92s]  Why would I reward them for going the wrong way?
[7531.92s -> 7532.48s]  They're idiots.
[7532.48s -> 7533.36s]  This cheese is not on the ground.
[7533.36s -> 7534.88s]  That's deducted by two points in creativity.
[7534.88s -> 7536.40s]  You can clearly see that it's not painted.
[7536.40s -> 7537.60s]  Thus, you must not go this way.
[7538.16s -> 7540.04s]  Connor, there's no cheese on the ground.
[7540.04s -> 7540.84s]  I'm sorry.
[7540.84s -> 7541.00s]  Why?
[7542.60s -> 7543.56s]  Is there cheese in this game?
[7543.56s -> 7544.68s]  Let me pull up the tablet right now.
[7544.68s -> 7545.24s]  There's no cheese.
[7545.24s -> 7545.64s]  There's no cheese.
[7545.64s -> 7546.52s]  There's no way there's cheese.
[7547.40s -> 7547.96s]  Yeah.
[7547.96s -> 7549.40s]  There's cheese.
[7549.40s -> 7550.20s]  There's no...
[7550.20s -> 7552.60s]  Connor, I'm sorry.
[7552.60s -> 7553.64s]  I didn't see that actually.
[7553.64s -> 7553.88s]  Sorry.
[7553.88s -> 7554.28s]  Okay.
[7554.28s -> 7554.68s]  My bad.
[7554.68s -> 7554.92s]  Sorry.
[7554.92s -> 7555.88s]  I shouldn't have argued you there.
[7558.03s -> 7559.63s]  Well, I don't even see what your pictures were.
[7559.63s -> 7559.95s]  All right.
[7559.95s -> 7562.75s]  Go back and let's do the rest of this.
[7562.75s -> 7563.42s]  All right.
[7563.98s -> 7564.94s]  You've chosen the right way.
[7564.94s -> 7565.90s]  Congratulations.
[7565.90s -> 7566.38s]  Okay.
[7566.38s -> 7571.02s]  Thus, signaled by the banana cocktail-esque wallpaper.
[7571.02s -> 7573.10s]  I painted this entire goddamn maze, by the way.
[7573.10s -> 7573.66s]  You'll see this.
[7573.66s -> 7574.22s]  Okay.
[7574.22s -> 7575.71s]  This is painstaking.
[7577.64s -> 7578.28s]  I don't know what this is.
[7579.16s -> 7579.96s]  Just a meme image.
[7579.96s -> 7580.36s]  It's all right.
[7580.36s -> 7581.08s]  Just a meme image.
[7582.22s -> 7582.70s]  It's just a...
[7582.70s -> 7582.94s]  Yeah.
[7583.58s -> 7585.90s]  Like I say, it hurts to be in your house.
[7585.90s -> 7587.44s]  Why does it hurt?
[7587.44s -> 7588.56s]  I feel like my shoulders are...
[7588.56s -> 7590.08s]  I have to go like this when I'm in your house.
[7590.08s -> 7590.64s]  That's the point.
[7590.64s -> 7591.60s]  That's the point of the house.
[7591.60s -> 7591.84s]  Okay.
[7591.84s -> 7592.88s]  You're not supposed to be comfortable.
[7592.88s -> 7593.44s]  It's my house.
[7593.44s -> 7594.40s]  Get out of my house.
[7594.40s -> 7594.56s]  Okay.
[7594.56s -> 7594.80s]  All right.
[7594.80s -> 7595.20s]  Keep going.
[7596.16s -> 7596.40s]  All right.
[7596.40s -> 7596.80s]  So here's...
[7596.80s -> 7597.60s]  We have another meme.
[7597.60s -> 7602.43s]  It's sky raisins and jalapenos sky raisins.
[7602.43s -> 7603.23s]  Keep going.
[7603.23s -> 7604.83s]  Keep going down this hallway.
[7605.71s -> 7607.31s]  I would like to move forward.
[7607.31s -> 7607.87s]  I would like to move forward.
[7607.87s -> 7607.95s]  Okay.
[7607.95s -> 7609.95s]  Would you like to keep going forward or would you like to turn?
[7610.83s -> 7613.21s]  I want to turn right down this.
[7613.21s -> 7615.05s]  All right.
[7615.05s -> 7615.45s]  Okay.
[7615.45s -> 7616.01s]  Okay.
[7616.01s -> 7617.85s]  And keep going just through here.
[7618.81s -> 7619.05s]  All right.
[7619.05s -> 7619.45s]  We have...
[7621.24s -> 7623.80s]  Why is it getting tighter and tighter and tighter in here?
[7623.80s -> 7624.92s]  Yeah, I did that on purpose.
[7624.92s -> 7626.76s]  I'm trying to make it as little room as possible.
[7626.76s -> 7627.24s]  Okay.
[7627.24s -> 7628.28s]  I don't know what that is,
[7628.28s -> 7629.88s]  but you just keep going through that.
[7629.88s -> 7631.56s]  That looks good.
[7631.56s -> 7632.20s]  Okay.
[7632.20s -> 7633.08s]  This is Yoda.
[7633.08s -> 7633.48s]  The Yoda.
[7633.48s -> 7637.00s]  You got to get some creative points for putting Yoda in this.
[7637.00s -> 7637.32s]  I don't...
[7637.32s -> 7638.04s]  Is that pizza?
[7638.04s -> 7639.00s]  Is it a cat with a pizza?
[7639.00s -> 7639.72s]  Is it a peanut butter?
[7641.00s -> 7643.64s]  You left another paint bucket on the ground, Connor.
[7643.64s -> 7643.96s]  Oh, no.
[7643.96s -> 7644.44s]  That was...
[7644.44s -> 7644.76s]  He got lost in the maze.
[7644.76s -> 7646.20s]  Oh, Connor.
[7646.20s -> 7646.68s]  Connor.
[7647.48s -> 7650.68s]  Your complexity and structure grade right now is a 65.
[7651.56s -> 7652.36s]  I'm sorry.
[7652.36s -> 7653.24s]  Oh, it's there on...
[7653.24s -> 7654.92s]  I'm sorry.
[7654.92s -> 7655.64s]  It just is...
[7655.64s -> 7657.44s]  We're going to...
[7657.44s -> 7658.40s]  I got to get your grades up here.
[7659.20s -> 7659.84s]  These are Joel's.
[7660.48s -> 7666.14s]  Let's clear those because you're at a 68 in complexity right now.
[7666.14s -> 7667.18s]  Oh, no, really?
[7667.18s -> 7667.68s]  Yeah.
[7669.04s -> 7671.28s]  The thing about this part is that it's a skill check
[7671.28s -> 7673.28s]  because as you can see, I just got stuck on it there
[7673.28s -> 7675.92s]  and you have to actually clip through it to get through.
[7675.92s -> 7677.76s]  You see I'm kind of stuck right now, but there we go.
[7677.76s -> 7678.24s]  We got it.
[7678.24s -> 7678.40s]  Okay.
[7678.40s -> 7679.44s]  So now you're in.
[7679.44s -> 7681.61s]  It's a potential skill check.
[7681.61s -> 7681.93s]  Okay.
[7681.93s -> 7685.21s]  So now this is the second time you've used this image.
[7685.21s -> 7686.25s]  I just want to make sure that's clear.
[7686.25s -> 7687.37s]  Third, actually, but...
[7687.37s -> 7687.93s]  Oh, third.
[7687.93s -> 7689.53s]  It is third.
[7689.53s -> 7690.49s]  It's an illusion.
[7690.49s -> 7691.21s]  It's an illusion.
[7691.21s -> 7693.37s]  So you come through, you're like, well, I just came this way.
[7693.37s -> 7693.93s]  There's no way this...
[7693.93s -> 7697.77s]  Oh, did I go the wrong way perhaps?
[7697.77s -> 7698.01s]  Right.
[7698.57s -> 7698.89s]  Okay.
[7698.89s -> 7699.29s]  Okay.
[7699.29s -> 7700.41s]  Are you good to continue?
[7700.41s -> 7701.77s]  We are good to continue.
[7701.77s -> 7705.58s]  I'm getting my grades correct here so far.
[7705.58s -> 7705.82s]  Okay.
[7707.80s -> 7708.92s]  I'm good to continue.
[7708.92s -> 7710.86s]  What is that?
[7712.06s -> 7712.86s]  You can use that.
[7712.86s -> 7713.74s]  What does that mean, use?
[7714.80s -> 7715.20s]  What do you mean?
[7715.20s -> 7716.00s]  Press E on that.
[7716.00s -> 7716.48s]  What does that mean?
[7720.84s -> 7721.16s]  Okay.
[7721.16s -> 7721.40s]  All right.
[7721.40s -> 7721.72s]  I get it.
[7721.72s -> 7722.04s]  I get it.
[7722.04s -> 7722.84s]  Oh, I can change it.
[7722.84s -> 7723.88s]  I'll change it to me.
[7723.88s -> 7724.36s]  There we go.
[7724.36s -> 7724.84s]  There we go.
[7724.84s -> 7726.28s]  Oh, right.
[7726.28s -> 7727.48s]  I think that changes things a lot.
[7727.48s -> 7730.04s]  That stretched me in a comfortable way.
[7730.76s -> 7731.64s]  All right.
[7731.64s -> 7732.84s]  Your creativity is...
[7732.84s -> 7735.24s]  I got your creativity so far at a 72.
[7735.24s -> 7735.72s]  That's a C.
[7735.72s -> 7737.56s]  It's above a C, C minus.
[7737.56s -> 7738.28s]  I think you can really...
[7738.28s -> 7739.08s]  It's high, right?
[7739.08s -> 7739.96s]  It can go higher.
[7739.96s -> 7741.88s]  I just want to let you know that your philosophy right now,
[7741.88s -> 7743.72s]  I'm going to give you a 95.
[7743.72s -> 7744.51s]  And the reason...
[7744.51s -> 7744.83s]  Oh, my God.
[7744.83s -> 7745.47s]  Thank you so much.
[7745.47s -> 7748.11s]  The reason why you're getting a 95 in philosophy is because
[7748.11s -> 7750.91s]  you took this concept of walls and maze
[7750.91s -> 7752.43s]  and you made it your entire house.
[7752.43s -> 7754.75s]  I've yet to see a piece of furniture, by the way.
[7754.75s -> 7756.67s]  I've yet to see a piece of furniture, by the way.
[7756.67s -> 7758.59s]  You will see furniture, don't you worry.
[7758.59s -> 7759.79s]  So we'll go forward.
[7759.79s -> 7761.87s]  And we can go this way, but there's nothing.
[7761.87s -> 7764.03s]  You can just stand here and contemplate.
[7764.03s -> 7766.19s]  You can also get a good view of this meme,
[7766.19s -> 7768.35s]  which says, I'll allow you to read it.
[7768.35s -> 7770.99s]  I look at the blood ocean sometimes and think, for real?
[7771.79s -> 7774.83s]  That's where the government is sending me in a windowless submarine.
[7774.83s -> 7776.99s]  As capital punishment for the greater good of the human race,
[7776.99s -> 7778.67s]  there is something outside...
[7778.67s -> 7780.35s]  I'm going to have to give you a 70 on creativity.
[7782.94s -> 7783.90s]  I couldn't even tell.
[7783.90s -> 7785.02s]  I couldn't even read what's going on here.
[7786.06s -> 7787.71s]  Okay, so I'll give you...
[7787.71s -> 7788.67s]  I'm going to drop the point.
[7788.67s -> 7789.55s]  Actually, I'll give you 71.
[7791.52s -> 7792.32s]  No, 73.
[7792.32s -> 7793.28s]  I'll give you 73.
[7793.28s -> 7794.88s]  I think you think I appreciate that.
[7794.88s -> 7796.24s]  So I can go this way, right?
[7796.24s -> 7796.74s]  Yep.
[7797.92s -> 7799.20s]  We also missed a completely...
[7799.20s -> 7800.16s]  This is the main branch.
[7800.16s -> 7801.04s]  I'll just spoil it for you.
[7801.04s -> 7801.60s]  Okay.
[7801.60s -> 7801.84s]  You can...
[7801.84s -> 7803.36s]  There was another branch as well that you missed.
[7803.36s -> 7804.48s]  Oh, show me, show me.
[7804.48s -> 7805.28s]  Please do, please do.
[7805.28s -> 7806.24s]  Yeah, yeah, it's...
[7806.24s -> 7806.64s]  Let me just...
[7806.64s -> 7807.36s]  It's going to take a minute.
[7807.36s -> 7808.32s]  Actually, I got to go through all this.
[7808.32s -> 7808.72s]  Hold on.
[7808.72s -> 7811.60s]  We do have about a 10-minute time limit for every contestant,
[7811.60s -> 7813.84s]  but it's okay.
[7813.84s -> 7814.40s]  But it's all right.
[7814.40s -> 7816.32s]  I think we can go over for a lot of these.
[7816.32s -> 7816.96s]  It's fine.
[7816.96s -> 7819.32s]  As long as everyone's cool with chilling for another,
[7819.72s -> 7820.60s]  30 minutes or so.
[7820.60s -> 7824.52s]  Yeah, this is the other part of the maze.
[7824.52s -> 7825.80s]  It's very clean.
[7825.80s -> 7826.68s]  It's very clean.
[7826.68s -> 7827.64s]  It's extremely clean.
[7827.64s -> 7828.52s]  I mean, it has to be.
[7828.52s -> 7830.60s]  The whole thing is yellow walls.
[7830.60s -> 7831.88s]  It kind of has to...
[7831.88s -> 7834.04s]  You have to get a 100 for clean.
[7834.04s -> 7834.54s]  Well...
[7835.40s -> 7837.48s]  No other life form can live here, actually.
[7838.20s -> 7840.20s]  There's so much asbestos and paint.
[7840.20s -> 7841.16s]  It's actually a lot of harm.
[7841.16s -> 7842.44s]  I'm going to do the skill check real quick.
[7842.44s -> 7843.64s]  Hold up.
[7843.64s -> 7845.68s]  Can you not even go through your house?
[7845.68s -> 7847.36s]  No, like I said, it's a skill check.
[7847.36s -> 7849.04s]  So anyone real game is going past this point.
[7849.04s -> 7849.52s]  Oh, okay.
[7849.52s -> 7851.58s]  That's actually kind of cool.
[7851.66s -> 7852.54s]  Yeah, I think you're...
[7852.54s -> 7853.50s]  I'll give you...
[7853.50s -> 7854.94s]  I'm going to give you a 75 for creativity
[7854.94s -> 7856.30s]  because given a skill check,
[7856.30s -> 7858.14s]  an FPS skill check to go through your house
[7858.14s -> 7858.78s]  is actually pretty...
[7858.78s -> 7859.34s]  That's interesting.
[7859.34s -> 7859.82s]  Exactly.
[7859.82s -> 7860.92s]  Yep.
[7860.92s -> 7863.48s]  So we have another meme image here.
[7865.13s -> 7867.05s]  Okay, near on butt.
[7868.80s -> 7869.28s]  Yeah, don't worry about it.
[7869.28s -> 7870.40s]  Is that Bernie Sanders right there?
[7870.40s -> 7872.32s]  Is that Bernie Sanders on the left?
[7872.32s -> 7874.88s]  No, this is Hide the Pain Herald in RTX.
[7874.88s -> 7877.34s]  It wasn't Bernie Sanders.
[7877.34s -> 7878.62s]  I'm just going to take a point out.
[7879.42s -> 7881.26s]  Would you have preferred it to be Bernie Sanders?
[7881.26s -> 7882.86s]  I just thought it was.
[7882.86s -> 7883.74s]  That made me laugh for a second.
[7883.74s -> 7884.38s]  Bernie's changed.
[7884.38s -> 7884.94s]  I had to change it.
[7885.74s -> 7888.94s]  And so now I really take the concept of uncomfortable,
[7888.94s -> 7891.10s]  you know, kind of an alleyways to an extreme here
[7891.10s -> 7892.86s]  by making it literally just...
[7892.86s -> 7895.26s]  You know, it's the limit you can actually walk.
[7896.46s -> 7898.46s]  I'm actually surprised you did this in an hour.
[7898.46s -> 7900.14s]  I want to...
[7900.14s -> 7901.50s]  Yeah, this is crazy, right?
[7901.50s -> 7903.00s]  You did this in an hour.
[7903.00s -> 7904.20s]  Yeah, I did.
[7904.20s -> 7906.28s]  I painted all the fucking walls.
[7906.28s -> 7907.16s]  I'm a psychopath.
[7907.16s -> 7907.96s]  I hate myself.
[7909.60s -> 7911.44s]  Yeah, you painted all the walls.
[7911.44s -> 7912.48s]  You really did.
[7912.48s -> 7915.34s]  You painted every single wall this color.
[7915.34s -> 7915.58s]  Yeah.
[7915.58s -> 7916.46s]  That's dedication.
[7916.46s -> 7918.78s]  It took nine hours, actually.
[7918.78s -> 7919.58s]  I started 10.
[7920.94s -> 7921.98s]  That's why I came on the call.
[7921.98s -> 7922.62s]  I was begging you.
[7922.62s -> 7924.38s]  I was like, there's got to be a faster way.
[7924.38s -> 7925.18s]  Please tell me.
[7926.99s -> 7927.55s]  There's not.
[7928.92s -> 7929.48s]  There wasn't.
[7930.84s -> 7932.92s]  So I'm very curious about what's up here on the right.
[7932.92s -> 7936.52s]  And I'd like for you to go open this right door.
[7936.52s -> 7937.16s]  Yeah.
[7937.16s -> 7937.56s]  Yeah, okay.
[7937.56s -> 7939.40s]  We got a Pepe image.
[7939.40s -> 7940.04s]  That's pretty cool.
[7940.99s -> 7941.47s]  Keep going.
[7941.47s -> 7943.95s]  The maze gets even more uncomfortable now.
[7943.95s -> 7944.43s]  Now we're just...
[7946.09s -> 7948.57s]  All right, go through the maze.
[7949.29s -> 7950.25s]  Go through the maze.
[7950.81s -> 7951.13s]  Okay.
[7952.73s -> 7953.61s]  Very easy to get lost.
[7953.61s -> 7954.01s]  Here we are.
[7954.01s -> 7954.49s]  Now we're in the...
[7954.49s -> 7954.81s]  Oh, I got lost.
[7954.81s -> 7955.13s]  Damn it.
[7955.13s -> 7955.45s]  Hold up.
[7955.45s -> 7955.93s]  Which way was it?
[7955.93s -> 7956.33s]  This way?
[7956.33s -> 7956.57s]  No.
[7956.57s -> 7957.13s]  No, this is...
[7957.13s -> 7957.69s]  I'm going back.
[7957.69s -> 7957.85s]  Okay.
[7957.85s -> 7958.09s]  No, I know.
[7958.09s -> 7958.57s]  That's the wrong way.
[7958.57s -> 7959.13s]  No, you're going the wrong way.
[7959.13s -> 7959.93s]  You're going the wrong way.
[7959.93s -> 7961.13s]  It's such a complex maze.
[7961.13s -> 7962.17s]  It's so easy to get lost.
[7962.81s -> 7965.37s]  Complexity is easily 100, I think, actually.
[7965.37s -> 7965.93s]  Complexity.
[7965.93s -> 7966.33s]  That's just my rating.
[7966.33s -> 7967.69s]  Complexity might have to go up a little.
[7967.69s -> 7968.01s]  Okay.
[7968.01s -> 7969.69s]  So there's a stair here.
[7969.69s -> 7972.17s]  And the best part about this stair, when you go up it,
[7972.17s -> 7974.57s]  it's purely aesthetic because it's completely useless.
[7974.57s -> 7977.23s]  There's nothing up here.
[7977.23s -> 7978.03s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[7978.03s -> 7978.27s]  There is.
[7978.27s -> 7978.59s]  There is.
[7978.59s -> 7979.95s]  There absolutely is.
[7979.95s -> 7980.43s]  Okay.
[7980.43s -> 7980.91s]  All right.
[7980.91s -> 7981.79s]  I like the aesthetic.
[7981.79s -> 7983.15s]  It's not going to change your score or anything,
[7983.15s -> 7984.19s]  but I like the aesthetic.
[7984.19s -> 7985.44s]  Okay.
[7985.44s -> 7986.24s]  What the fuck is this?
[7986.24s -> 7987.84s]  Above me, Scoob.
[7987.84s -> 7988.96s]  You got a Scooby Doo.
[7988.96s -> 7990.32s]  You got a Scooby Doo meme in here.
[7991.04s -> 7992.88s]  Take your philosophy down by a few points.
[7994.08s -> 7994.56s]  What?
[7994.56s -> 7996.16s]  It's the part of the film.
[7996.16s -> 7996.40s]  Okay.
[7996.40s -> 7997.36s]  So we go...
[7997.36s -> 7998.64s]  Now that we've finished this floor,
[7998.64s -> 8000.64s]  it's to signal that you're near the end.
[8000.64s -> 8000.96s]  All right.
[8000.96s -> 8003.84s]  So I decided to go for a blank aesthetic for the rest of the maze.
[8003.84s -> 8005.44s]  Okay.
[8005.44s -> 8007.36s]  Also, I was running out of paint and time.
[8008.00s -> 8008.64s]  Just...
[8008.64s -> 8009.52s]  Sorry, let me close this.
[8009.52s -> 8009.84s]  You didn't...
[8009.84s -> 8010.24s]  Okay.
[8010.24s -> 8011.28s]  So you go through now.
[8011.28s -> 8012.64s]  This is where the doors come into effect.
[8013.20s -> 8015.12s]  I'm trying to constrict it with a new method now.
[8015.12s -> 8016.72s]  What did you fucking make?
[8017.36s -> 8017.92s]  All right.
[8017.92s -> 8018.96s]  It's a new way of constricting.
[8018.96s -> 8020.40s]  So go through here.
[8021.92s -> 8022.96s]  Was that Final Fantasy?
[8023.52s -> 8023.84s]  All right.
[8023.84s -> 8024.72s]  Final Fantasy.
[8026.09s -> 8027.85s]  What is going on in this picture?
[8033.36s -> 8034.88s]  Where is the furniture?
[8034.88s -> 8035.76s]  Where is the furniture?
[8035.76s -> 8036.56s]  Show me the furniture.
[8036.56s -> 8038.00s]  Show me the room with the furniture right now.
[8038.48s -> 8040.00s]  This is the final...
[8040.00s -> 8041.28s]  Are you sure you want to continue?
[8041.28s -> 8042.96s]  We give you a chance to end it all.
[8042.96s -> 8044.48s]  Because it can be tough.
[8044.48s -> 8045.04s]  This is the...
[8045.04s -> 8047.04s]  And also, I couldn't build a wall here.
[8047.04s -> 8048.72s]  But this is your final get out.
[8048.72s -> 8049.12s]  If you...
[8049.12s -> 8050.56s]  And also, you get stuck at the doors.
[8050.56s -> 8051.44s]  So you...
[8051.44s -> 8052.48s]  I actually kind of like that.
[8052.48s -> 8055.44s]  You made the haunted house thing where, like, if you want to leave...
[8055.44s -> 8056.96s]  It's like, no, no, you can get out of here.
[8056.96s -> 8057.76s]  Like, I'm scared.
[8057.76s -> 8058.40s]  There's an exit here.
[8058.40s -> 8058.64s]  I get it.
[8058.64s -> 8058.88s]  Okay.
[8058.88s -> 8059.52s]  I like it.
[8059.52s -> 8061.36s]  Are you really sure you want to see what's coming up?
[8061.36s -> 8062.88s]  Because it's bad.
[8062.88s -> 8065.45s]  Yeah, that changes things a lot for me.
[8065.45s -> 8067.29s]  So, you know, it's true to life.
[8067.29s -> 8068.81s]  And also, it's safety regulations.
[8068.81s -> 8069.77s]  We had to have an exit.
[8069.77s -> 8069.93s]  Okay.
[8070.57s -> 8071.71s]  So let's go...
[8071.71s -> 8073.07s]  Okay, you also get clipped on the door.
[8073.07s -> 8073.79s]  So you have to open them.
[8073.79s -> 8074.35s]  It's actually kind of...
[8074.99s -> 8076.03s]  It's kind of a great thing.
[8076.03s -> 8077.79s]  Because you have to consider...
[8077.79s -> 8080.19s]  I love how there's two doors that go to the same place.
[8081.61s -> 8082.09s]  Yes.
[8082.09s -> 8084.12s]  I thought it was more dramatic.
[8084.12s -> 8084.36s]  All right.
[8084.36s -> 8085.00s]  Here we go.
[8085.00s -> 8085.88s]  Is this the final room?
[8085.88s -> 8086.38s]  Okay.
[8091.34s -> 8092.38s]  There is another room.
[8092.38s -> 8093.26s]  Of course, there's another room.
[8093.26s -> 8094.54s]  But this is the prelude.
[8096.59s -> 8097.31s]  It says...
[8097.31s -> 8098.99s]  I'll let you read this.
[8098.99s -> 8100.19s]  All right.
[8100.19s -> 8101.23s]  Sometimes the side...
[8101.23s -> 8103.23s]  If you can't even a chick, it's C-Dog VA.
[8103.23s -> 8104.99s]  Scrump, Dill, Dumpster's, Dump Truck.
[8108.80s -> 8112.67s]  This is your live reaction to that.
[8112.67s -> 8113.39s]  Okay.
[8113.39s -> 8115.95s]  I'm going to give you an extra point in complexity.
[8115.95s -> 8117.55s]  I took some points down for creativity.
[8118.19s -> 8121.39s]  There's also this plant matter on the ground.
[8121.39s -> 8123.39s]  I'm going to read down on Glen Lewis a little bit here.
[8123.39s -> 8124.35s]  This plant matter on the ground.
[8124.35s -> 8125.07s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[8126.59s -> 8127.47s]  They're in jars.
[8127.47s -> 8128.75s]  So that's extremely clean.
[8128.75s -> 8129.47s]  Because we're not...
[8129.47s -> 8130.75s]  There's no dirt.
[8130.75s -> 8131.79s]  It's all self-contained.
[8133.79s -> 8135.23s]  Do you see any of the dirt outside?
[8135.23s -> 8136.11s]  Because I don't.
[8136.11s -> 8137.31s]  That's extremely clean.
[8137.31s -> 8138.19s]  That is pretty clean.
[8138.19s -> 8140.51s]  Because we need some oxygen generation.
[8141.77s -> 8142.09s]  All right.
[8142.09s -> 8142.89s]  What's the last room?
[8142.89s -> 8143.53s]  Let's see it.
[8143.53s -> 8145.55s]  Well, there's actually another door.
[8147.07s -> 8150.62s]  You just put walls up and put doors on them
[8150.62s -> 8152.54s]  and made a gigantic fucking maze.
[8152.54s -> 8153.42s]  It's the room.
[8153.42s -> 8154.70s]  It's a philosophy.
[8154.70s -> 8155.82s]  I had a hundred points.
[8155.82s -> 8158.91s]  There's the furniture.
[8158.91s -> 8160.19s]  It's one couch.
[8160.19s -> 8160.83s]  All right.
[8160.83s -> 8161.55s]  I'm going to have to...
[8161.55s -> 8162.51s]  Here we go.
[8162.51s -> 8163.15s]  No, no, no.
[8163.15s -> 8164.59s]  It's the casting couch.
[8164.59s -> 8166.91s]  Look, Shrek is signaling what could be happening here.
[8166.91s -> 8167.15s]  All right.
[8167.15s -> 8168.03s]  I'm going to have to...
[8168.03s -> 8169.23s]  I do appreciate the maze.
[8169.23s -> 8170.83s]  The maze is very, very interesting.
[8171.63s -> 8172.75s]  Look, if you were to tell me
[8172.75s -> 8174.91s]  I got an hour and 20 minutes to do something,
[8174.91s -> 8176.59s]  I don't know if an elaborate maze
[8176.59s -> 8177.95s]  would be the first thing I would do.
[8177.95s -> 8179.23s]  I would focus on building a room.
[8179.95s -> 8180.75s]  You don't have any rooms.
[8180.75s -> 8182.11s]  I built the back rooms.
[8182.11s -> 8184.27s]  You've got zero rooms.
[8184.27s -> 8184.67s]  You've got...
[8184.67s -> 8185.87s]  It's all one room.
[8185.87s -> 8186.43s]  No, no.
[8186.43s -> 8187.63s]  This is one room.
[8187.63s -> 8188.83s]  This is two rooms.
[8188.83s -> 8190.11s]  This is three rooms.
[8190.11s -> 8190.91s]  So I'm going to give you...
[8190.91s -> 8191.79s]  Here's my grades for you.
[8191.79s -> 8192.59s]  We're going to get Chad's grade.
[8192.59s -> 8194.03s]  Chad, if we could go ahead and get Chad's grades.
[8194.03s -> 8195.55s]  Remember, it's A, B, C, or D.
[8197.02s -> 8198.22s]  I'm going to look at what they're saying.
[8198.22s -> 8200.06s]  I want to see how they're feeling about this.
[8200.06s -> 8201.50s]  I feel like A, for sure.
[8201.50s -> 8203.18s]  Well, actually, there are a couple of As.
[8203.18s -> 8204.62s]  I've seen a few Bs.
[8209.79s -> 8210.99s]  It's A. It's got to be an A, at least.
[8210.99s -> 8211.55s]  There's no way.
[8211.55s -> 8213.31s]  What is Chad's grade?
[8213.31s -> 8216.03s]  You can't give anything lower than a D.
[8216.03s -> 8216.43s]  Sorry.
[8221.66s -> 8222.30s]  Here's what I got you at.
[8222.30s -> 8223.50s]  I got you at a 70 for...
[8223.50s -> 8225.34s]  I got you at a C for creativity.
[8225.34s -> 8226.86s]  Well, actually, I'm going to give you 75.
[8226.86s -> 8228.30s]  I think that you had a...
[8229.02s -> 8230.46s]  I like the maze idea.
[8230.46s -> 8231.90s]  I'll give you 75 for creativity.
[8232.89s -> 8235.95s]  I've got you at a 69 for complexity because...
[8236.83s -> 8240.43s]  It's arguably the most complex house that you'll see all day.
[8240.43s -> 8243.07s]  I mean, the amount of walls and redecoration and painting.
[8243.07s -> 8244.03s]  It's extremely complex.
[8244.03s -> 8246.65s]  I got you at an 86 for cleanliness.
[8246.65s -> 8251.13s]  I've got you at an 85 for philosophy because I do think you did have a pretty...
[8251.69s -> 8252.73s]  You had a good theme here.
[8252.73s -> 8254.57s]  You've stuck with the theme completely.
[8255.58s -> 8257.18s]  So, Chad's grade is...
[8258.91s -> 8263.55s]  If I may ask, the cleanliness, I mean, I find it hard to believe it's not 100.
[8264.43s -> 8267.23s]  Obviously, I disagree with your ruling on this, but I just...
[8267.23s -> 8268.59s]  Where were those 14 points?
[8268.59s -> 8269.23s]  Where are they going?
[8270.36s -> 8273.66s]  So, the cleanliness problem was there was two paint cans on the ground.
[8273.66s -> 8276.94s]  And the issue with the paint cans is you had a good cover for the first one,
[8276.94s -> 8278.38s]  but the second one was there.
[8278.38s -> 8278.62s]  Also...
[8278.62s -> 8279.34s]  It was a skill check.
[8281.96s -> 8285.24s]  I'll give you an 89 for cleanliness.
[8285.24s -> 8285.80s]  All right. Thank you.
[8285.80s -> 8286.04s]  Thank you.
[8286.04s -> 8286.12s]  I appreciate that.
[8286.12s -> 8287.68s]  I think that works.
[8287.68s -> 8290.72s]  And then Chad's grade is nobody can get lower than a 60.
[8291.36s -> 8292.08s]  Conor, I'm sorry.
[8292.08s -> 8294.17s]  They have given you an F.
[8294.17s -> 8294.65s]  What?
[8294.65s -> 8295.05s]  Yeah.
[8296.09s -> 8296.41s]  An F?
[8296.41s -> 8297.45s]  What? They don't like the maze?
[8297.45s -> 8298.41s]  They didn't like the maze?
[8298.41s -> 8298.81s]  What are you doing?
[8298.81s -> 8299.85s]  I could give them an F.
[8299.85s -> 8302.12s]  How do they not like the maze?
[8302.12s -> 8305.60s]  Oh, I liked it.
[8305.60s -> 8306.24s]  Oh, my God.
[8306.24s -> 8307.04s]  Well, fair enough.
[8307.04s -> 8308.00s]  I swear to God.
[8308.00s -> 8310.08s]  Your overall grade is actually not that bad.
[8310.08s -> 8313.52s]  Your overall grade is a 75.6.
[8313.52s -> 8315.60s]  That's a full C.
[8315.60s -> 8318.72s]  For somebody that woke up at 4 o'clock in the morning to do this
[8318.72s -> 8320.64s]  and learned how to play the game an hour ago,
[8320.64s -> 8321.60s]  actually great fucking job.
[8321.60s -> 8322.24s]  Seriously.
[8322.24s -> 8322.72s]  That's actually...
[8322.72s -> 8323.28s]  You did really well.
[8323.28s -> 8324.68s]  I appreciate that.
[8324.68s -> 8325.00s]  Thank you.
[8325.00s -> 8325.64s]  I'll take the C.
[8325.64s -> 8326.52s]  I'll take the C.
[8326.52s -> 8328.60s]  Overall of a 75.6.
[8328.60s -> 8329.76s]  All right. I'll take it.
[8329.76s -> 8330.16s]  I'll take it.
[8330.16s -> 8332.00s]  Thank you so much for judging me.
[8332.00s -> 8333.04s]  I appreciate it.
[8333.04s -> 8334.48s]  Thanks for waking up early for this, Connor.
[8335.53s -> 8336.09s]  No worries.
[8336.09s -> 8337.05s]  We're excited to see the rest.
[8337.69s -> 8338.49s]  That was fucking funny.
[8338.49s -> 8338.81s]  Thank you.
[8340.35s -> 8341.15s]  No worries.
[8342.51s -> 8342.91s]  All right.
[8343.47s -> 8346.11s]  That was C-Dawg.
[8346.11s -> 8348.44s]  The next person we have is RT.
[8349.18s -> 8350.54s]  RT is coming up here next.
[8350.54s -> 8351.98s]  Oh, is it myself next?
[8351.98s -> 8353.50s]  I thought it was until later.
[8353.50s -> 8354.22s]  Oh, did we...
[8354.22s -> 8355.26s]  Oh, no, we did swap you.
[8355.74s -> 8360.91s]  I'm just making sure that I can get around to everyone.
[8360.91s -> 8362.03s]  Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[8362.03s -> 8364.03s]  Okay, we swapped out.
[8364.03s -> 8365.31s]  It's Alex is here now, right?
[8365.31s -> 8368.00s]  I believe that's who's here now.
[8368.00s -> 8369.28s]  He's completely deafened.
[8370.65s -> 8371.37s]  Yeah, it's Alex.
[8371.37s -> 8371.93s]  There.
[8371.93s -> 8372.57s]  Hey.
[8372.57s -> 8373.95s]  He's clear to go.
[8373.95s -> 8374.75s]  Are you good?
[8374.75s -> 8375.47s]  Are you ready?
[8375.47s -> 8376.43s]  You want me to go?
[8376.43s -> 8377.79s]  I mean, I'm happy to go.
[8377.79s -> 8380.67s]  If you just give me one second here, I can set it up.
[8380.67s -> 8381.39s]  I'm good right now.
[8381.39s -> 8382.19s]  Are you good, Alex?
[8382.19s -> 8383.07s]  Are you good to stick around?
[8383.07s -> 8383.55s]  Yeah.
[8383.55s -> 8384.03s]  All right.
[8384.03s -> 8384.67s]  Let's go.
[8384.67s -> 8387.79s]  Yeah, and we're trying to keep these around 10-ish minutes.
[8387.79s -> 8390.99s]  I know some of these are worth going around to.
[8390.99s -> 8391.95s]  So, I mean, whatever.
[8391.95s -> 8392.43s]  It's all good.
[8392.43s -> 8394.27s]  Everyone should get 25 minutes now.
[8394.27s -> 8396.03s]  Everybody should get 20 minutes.
[8396.03s -> 8397.48s]  Wait, no, sorry.
[8397.48s -> 8400.04s]  You can't limit the rest of us to like less time.
[8400.04s -> 8402.20s]  We have to make a bargain, too.
[8402.20s -> 8404.68s]  Sorry, my Discord completely crashed.
[8404.68s -> 8405.88s]  Oh, shit.
[8405.88s -> 8406.12s]  All right.
[8406.12s -> 8406.68s]  Well, it's Alex.
[8406.68s -> 8407.08s]  Are you ready?
[8407.88s -> 8409.40s]  I didn't mean to just be like put on the spot.
[8409.40s -> 8410.52s]  It's like, right, I'm going home.
[8410.52s -> 8411.40s]  I've got nothing to show.
[8411.40s -> 8413.08s]  No, it's a fantastic home.
[8413.08s -> 8415.16s]  Oh, I actually cannot wait to see yours.
[8415.16s -> 8416.36s]  But it's Alex.
[8416.36s -> 8419.07s]  You want to go instead of because his Discord crashed?
[8419.07s -> 8420.59s]  OK, I can do that.
[8420.59s -> 8422.35s]  And we'll get you back in RT later.
[8422.35s -> 8424.11s]  All right, Alex, are you ready to put your...
[8424.11s -> 8424.91s]  Fire away.
[8424.91s -> 8425.79s]  ...put your stream on?
[8425.79s -> 8431.18s]  Let me make sure you can see it.
[8431.18s -> 8432.70s]  Somebody, we need to stop Poke?
[8434.32s -> 8435.76s]  Is Poke still building?
[8435.76s -> 8436.88s]  Poke is still going.
[8438.32s -> 8439.76s]  Did anybody tell him to stop?
[8441.20s -> 8442.16s]  He's still going?
[8442.16s -> 8443.04s]  He's still going.
[8443.04s -> 8443.44s]  Yeah, that's...
[8447.20s -> 8448.00s]  All right, cut.
[8448.00s -> 8448.96s]  Poke, if you can hear us,
[8448.96s -> 8450.88s]  Poke in yours, you need to stop building.
[8450.88s -> 8452.16s]  Poke, you need to stop building.
[8452.88s -> 8454.00s]  Poke, you have to stop building.
[8455.13s -> 8456.97s]  Everyone's been trying to get a hold of him.
[8458.25s -> 8459.53s]  He's just going.
[8459.53s -> 8460.49s]  We tried.
[8460.49s -> 8461.77s]  We pinged him like three times.
[8461.77s -> 8463.47s]  That's so funny.
[8463.47s -> 8466.00s]  All right, so this is Italics.
[8466.00s -> 8467.52s]  Yeah, can you see everything?
[8467.52s -> 8470.24s]  We can see and we are very excited, it's Alex.
[8470.88s -> 8471.44s]  The time...
[8471.44s -> 8475.56s]  Oh, hey, Poke, yeah, you have to stop building.
[8475.56s -> 8479.40s]  You said 30 FPS, better text readability.
[8479.40s -> 8481.40s]  Yeah, it looks good on our end.
[8481.40s -> 8482.89s]  OK.
[8482.89s -> 8483.85s]  All right, it's Alex.
[8483.85s -> 8484.89s]  Welcome to my home.
[8485.45s -> 8488.89s]  I went for the detail oriented approach
[8488.89s -> 8491.61s]  and we have a completely clean yard.
[8492.17s -> 8492.73s]  Oh, wait, hold on.
[8492.73s -> 8493.77s]  Restart, restart, restart.
[8493.77s -> 8496.09s]  Can you redo it and take away the text readability?
[8496.09s -> 8497.45s]  Because we might not need to do that
[8497.45s -> 8503.05s]  because like we're both on the West Coast.
[8503.05s -> 8504.01s]  We're good, we're good, we got it.
[8504.01s -> 8504.89s]  Starting over.
[8504.89s -> 8505.69s]  We got it, we got it.
[8507.77s -> 8509.05s]  So smoother video instead?
[8509.77s -> 8512.41s]  Yeah, I think as long as you don't have to do the text mode thing,
[8512.41s -> 8513.45s]  you just have to check that box.
[8516.88s -> 8518.88s]  OK, how is that?
[8518.88s -> 8519.92s]  That looks better.
[8519.92s -> 8520.56s]  Can you move around?
[8522.65s -> 8523.45s]  Hey, all right.
[8523.45s -> 8524.41s]  Looks good on our end.
[8524.41s -> 8526.25s]  OK, looks good.
[8526.25s -> 8526.49s]  All right.
[8526.49s -> 8527.37s]  So what do we got?
[8528.72s -> 8529.12s]  All right.
[8529.12s -> 8530.24s]  Welcome to my plot.
[8531.42s -> 8535.02s]  We've got turf laid down on the entire plot.
[8535.02s -> 8536.30s]  You won't find any weeds.
[8536.30s -> 8538.14s]  First of all, that's a full clap.
[8538.14s -> 8538.86s]  That's a full clap.
[8539.74s -> 8542.70s]  I can't believe you actually did this in 60 minutes, 70 minutes.
[8543.50s -> 8546.30s]  This is a 100% clean backyard.
[8547.20s -> 8547.84s]  Wow.
[8547.84s -> 8550.88s]  And I'll show you the corner as well.
[8550.88s -> 8554.16s]  The turf changes as it gets in the back, but it's still turf.
[8554.16s -> 8559.10s]  OK, so there won't there's no like there's no little ugly dirt spots.
[8559.10s -> 8563.50s]  We have a nice suburban yard that we can have the kids go out and play.
[8563.50s -> 8564.14s]  That sounds great.
[8564.14s -> 8564.38s]  All right.
[8564.38s -> 8570.04s]  So you're starting off at cleanliness at 100 right now, by the way.
[8570.04s -> 8572.84s]  And we tried to get a little custom with the house
[8572.84s -> 8575.08s]  and get some give us some paneling, give it some paint.
[8575.64s -> 8577.32s]  Now, let me take you inside.
[8577.32s -> 8579.88s]  So I just learned how to play house flipper yesterday
[8579.88s -> 8588.25s]  and I was under the impression that this is a house flipper competition.
[8588.25s -> 8590.01s]  So I have OK.
[8590.01s -> 8593.69s]  All right. That's oh, that's pretty damn good.
[8594.72s -> 8599.48s]  I have to tell you that's actually for complexity sake.
[8599.48s -> 8600.56s]  Oh, yeah.
[8600.56s -> 8602.16s]  Yeah. All right.
[8602.16s -> 8603.52s]  You're it's Alex.
[8603.52s -> 8605.20s]  You're you're I got to listen.
[8605.20s -> 8607.12s]  I got to tell you how complex this was.
[8608.12s -> 8613.32s]  You're like a world first documented ability to do what you're seeing here.
[8614.84s -> 8615.40s]  It's not on.
[8615.40s -> 8617.80s]  How did you even get the furniture to go upside down?
[8620.32s -> 8624.64s]  Hours of trying to figure out how to do it after we did it on accident.
[8624.96s -> 8626.40s]  OK. OK. All right.
[8626.40s -> 8627.04s]  I'm feeling it.
[8627.04s -> 8628.00s]  I put in the training.
[8628.00s -> 8628.80s]  I put in the work.
[8628.80s -> 8633.18s]  I put in the preparation, but we knocked down all the walls
[8633.18s -> 8636.36s]  and gave it some, you know, a little flair.
[8636.36s -> 8638.92s]  You got you got a nice little sliding door.
[8638.92s -> 8642.68s]  So far, you and Joel, you and Joel had different walls so far,
[8642.68s -> 8645.56s]  except you might be noticing every season the same paint.
[8645.56s -> 8647.63s]  Everyone's got the same paint.
[8647.63s -> 8649.23s]  That's because it's landlord beige.
[8649.23s -> 8652.51s]  You know, it's just that's the start with.
[8652.51s -> 8655.21s]  OK. OK. Give me some more.
[8655.21s -> 8661.13s]  We got some water flowing uphill because this is the house that is flipped.
[8661.13s -> 8664.86s]  OK. And we got like a nice little dining area.
[8664.86s -> 8670.30s]  There's a piano here so that you can enjoy an elegant presentation
[8670.30s -> 8672.86s]  with your friends while you're having some food.
[8672.86s -> 8675.47s]  Beautiful. Oh, you even got the seats.
[8675.47s -> 8678.12s]  Did you do this through the whole house?
[8678.12s -> 8682.12s]  Well, yes, but you're kind of you're looking at the whole house.
[8682.12s -> 8686.04s]  The majority of the time was spent making sure that
[8686.12s -> 8691.32s]  all of the little details like the exterior were taken care of and clean.
[8692.59s -> 8695.71s]  It's it's extremely clean. Look at that sheen on the wood.
[8695.71s -> 8699.61s]  You have the first person to show sheen on wood, by the way.
[8699.61s -> 8705.92s]  So it took a long time to get all of the like we have a second floor paint job.
[8705.92s -> 8711.68s]  We got paneling on the first exterior, actually put in some some windows
[8711.68s -> 8715.04s]  and some sliding doors and like a proper front door.
[8715.20s -> 8719.60s]  Got a nice little seating area with a big screen TV and some speakers.
[8719.60s -> 8721.48s]  Is that an award on the table?
[8721.48s -> 8723.93s]  Yeah, that's my award for getting first place.
[8723.93s -> 8725.05s]  Oh, that's confidence.
[8725.05s -> 8726.41s]  Yeah, that philosophy.
[8726.41s -> 8728.25s]  I'm going to have to give you a 95 on that right now.
[8730.25s -> 8731.77s]  That's honest to God.
[8731.77s -> 8732.73s]  That's a philosophy.
[8732.73s -> 8733.77s]  That is a vibe.
[8733.77s -> 8735.21s]  And it's you're up very high right now.
[8735.21s -> 8737.80s]  I just want to make sure you know that.
[8737.80s -> 8739.98s]  Thank you. I appreciate being recognized.
[8739.98s -> 8744.57s]  Sometimes overconfidence can be a little bit of a downfall.
[8744.57s -> 8746.73s]  So philosophy is going from a 95 to a 93.
[8746.81s -> 8750.04s]  Look at the fish.
[8750.04s -> 8751.58s]  They can fill it with.
[8751.58s -> 8755.37s]  Oh, you actually can go upside down.
[8755.37s -> 8756.17s]  Oh, yeah.
[8756.17s -> 8757.13s]  Wait, do it again.
[8760.06s -> 8760.46s]  I'm sorry.
[8760.46s -> 8761.42s]  I got to apologize.
[8761.42s -> 8764.78s]  We presented the house in the wrong way.
[8764.78s -> 8770.51s]  I want to make sure I win the house flipper competition.
[8770.51s -> 8771.07s]  It's Alex.
[8771.07s -> 8773.32s]  I don't know if anyone's going to beat you.
[8773.32s -> 8775.56s]  I don't think anyone's going to come close.
[8775.56s -> 8777.08s]  I don't think anyone's going to come close.
[8777.08s -> 8781.40s]  If you'd like to sit and enjoy the TV or check on the neighbors
[8781.40s -> 8782.92s]  outside through the front window.
[8782.92s -> 8787.16s]  Yeah, that was I mean, I don't I mean, what do I do about this?
[8787.64s -> 8789.40s]  This is this was Connor's grades.
[8789.40s -> 8790.94s]  Hold on a second here.
[8790.94s -> 8792.14s]  We got you out of creativity.
[8792.14s -> 8792.86s]  We got you out.
[8792.86s -> 8795.18s]  I got you out of 95 for creativity.
[8795.18s -> 8797.93s]  I got you out of 100 for complexity.
[8797.93s -> 8805.61s]  I've got you at a 100 for cleanliness, although this can come down from here.
[8805.61s -> 8810.01s]  Well, the cleanliness can't go down because this is I can show you the upstairs.
[8810.65s -> 8811.77s]  That's what I'm concerned about.
[8813.21s -> 8817.53s]  It took so long to get all these other beautiful details just so that
[8818.43s -> 8820.83s]  I had to choose my focus.
[8820.83s -> 8821.31s]  That's true.
[8821.31s -> 8826.51s]  Just try to get the downstairs as much as possible in a very short amount of time.
[8826.51s -> 8829.58s]  But, you know, you've got like at least a urinals.
[8829.58s -> 8830.38s]  Oh, yeah.
[8830.38s -> 8832.80s]  Just that reveal I got.
[8832.80s -> 8835.12s]  That flip reveal is going to be living here.
[8835.12s -> 8837.20s]  You know, the urinals get dirty after a while.
[8837.20s -> 8839.04s]  So you want to be able to switch to the other ones.
[8839.04s -> 8842.30s]  OK, I like it.
[8842.30s -> 8843.82s]  My I didn't do this.
[8844.78s -> 8845.98s]  The sink is leaky.
[8847.23s -> 8848.03s]  This is just fault.
[8848.03s -> 8848.75s]  I'm taking this back.
[8849.95s -> 8854.64s]  Is it water damage underneath them?
[8854.64s -> 8855.84s]  It's still under warranty.
[8855.84s -> 8856.75s]  OK.
[8856.75s -> 8856.99s]  All right.
[8856.99s -> 8857.87s]  What is it?
[8857.87s -> 8860.46s]  Can you go up or down technically?
[8860.46s -> 8860.94s]  I can.
[8861.50s -> 8862.14s]  It's clean.
[8862.14s -> 8864.38s]  Oh, but it's just it's twisted that way.
[8864.38s -> 8865.10s]  All right.
[8865.10s -> 8865.74s]  Yep.
[8865.74s -> 8869.02s]  The majority the majority of the time was spent.
[8869.02s -> 8870.54s]  All right.
[8870.54s -> 8872.46s]  This was this was phenomenal.
[8873.39s -> 8876.99s]  I will have to tell you this is probably up and also probably number one so far.
[8876.99s -> 8878.19s]  But there is no number one.
[8879.07s -> 8881.15s]  We scared off the moles outside.
[8881.15s -> 8883.74s]  OK, we dug up all the holes.
[8883.74s -> 8884.86s]  Oh, there's no tires.
[8884.86s -> 8886.06s]  There's no weeds.
[8886.06s -> 8888.06s]  It is a clean cut all the way across.
[8888.06s -> 8890.14s]  I was told the outside is very important.
[8890.14s -> 8891.26s]  Where's the maze?
[8891.26s -> 8891.74s]  Oh, yeah.
[8891.74s -> 8892.54s]  Where's the maze?
[8892.54s -> 8893.93s]  Open the garage.
[8893.93s -> 8899.64s]  I want to see in the garage and I want to see every corner of the garage.
[8899.64s -> 8900.84s]  You didn't just put everything in here, right?
[8900.84s -> 8902.28s]  You didn't just put all the chairs and stuff in here.
[8902.28s -> 8906.25s]  No, you can you can actually put two cars in this two car garage.
[8906.25s -> 8907.77s]  Actually using for cars.
[8911.96s -> 8913.88s]  I thought there was going to be a very short.
[8913.88s -> 8916.84s]  I'm going to I'm going to emphasize brevity in my presentation.
[8918.36s -> 8919.00s]  You've seen it.
[8919.00s -> 8919.48s]  This is it.
[8919.48s -> 8921.72s]  I have the house flipped house.
[8922.44s -> 8923.88s]  I think so.
[8923.88s -> 8924.92s]  Chat, what's your grade?
[8924.92s -> 8926.52s]  Go ahead and give it A, B, C or D.
[8927.72s -> 8929.96s]  I'm going to have to go ahead and say that for your complexity,
[8929.96s -> 8932.28s]  complexity carries this the whole time.
[8932.28s -> 8935.48s]  I think that you being able to flip that and turn it the way
[8936.30s -> 8938.78s]  that was an unbelievably huge deal.
[8938.78s -> 8942.35s]  I think that one of the reasons why hold on.
[8942.35s -> 8942.99s]  Oops.
[8942.99s -> 8946.11s]  OK, one of the reasons why you're going to be up there pretty high
[8946.11s -> 8950.35s]  is because of the flip reveal, not just the fact that you did flip it,
[8950.35s -> 8953.95s]  but the fact that I and everybody watching it was built entirely upside down.
[8953.95s -> 8954.99s]  It was built entirely upset.
[8954.99s -> 8956.91s]  Center here was put upside down.
[8957.77s -> 8959.05s]  That was a phenomenal, phenomenal presentation.
[8959.05s -> 8963.29s]  You physically cannot do it without being upside down.
[8963.29s -> 8966.25s]  And the way that you get upside down is actually so secret
[8966.25s -> 8968.17s]  that it isn't even on the wiki for this game.
[8968.17s -> 8970.94s]  We discovered it on accident.
[8970.94s -> 8975.07s]  What do you mean we like I I practiced yesterday
[8975.07s -> 8976.67s]  so I could understand how to play the game.
[8976.67s -> 8977.79s]  You know, I got familiar with it.
[8977.79s -> 8978.59s]  OK, OK.
[8978.59s -> 8982.06s]  I thought you meant like somebody in chat told you to do that.
[8982.06s -> 8984.86s]  No, I flipped upside down and then we spent an hour and a half
[8984.86s -> 8985.82s]  trying to figure out how to do it.
[8985.82s -> 8987.34s]  Oh, OK.
[8987.34s -> 8987.82s]  All right.
[8987.82s -> 8988.30s]  All right.
[8988.30s -> 8989.55s]  That's all right.
[8989.55s -> 8989.87s]  Here you go.
[8989.87s -> 8990.92s]  Here are your grades.
[8990.92s -> 8993.72s]  You got a 95 for creativity.
[8993.72s -> 8996.33s]  You got 100 for complexity.
[8996.33s -> 8998.09s]  You get a 100 for cleanliness.
[8998.09s -> 8998.89s]  This is a very good.
[8998.89s -> 9000.33s]  This is a very good grade.
[9000.33s -> 9002.49s]  Your philosophy is a 93.
[9002.49s -> 9005.85s]  The only thing that I'm going to do here is I'm going to bring it down to a 90.
[9005.85s -> 9010.81s]  And I'll tell you one reason why the whole house was built around
[9010.81s -> 9013.58s]  and going upside down everything.
[9013.58s -> 9017.42s]  And there's no second floor and there's no basement.
[9017.42s -> 9018.86s]  And the garage is empty.
[9018.86s -> 9019.84s]  That's fair.
[9019.84s -> 9024.24s]  But I thought that having quality individual rooms would make up for
[9024.24s -> 9027.92s]  instead of having like a bunch of things scattered around.
[9027.92s -> 9029.84s]  You know, I went through quality over quantity.
[9029.84s -> 9031.20s]  You did, which is why you still get an A.
[9031.20s -> 9031.92s]  And you know, I'll make it.
[9031.92s -> 9035.58s]  I'll make it a 92.
[9035.58s -> 9038.22s]  So chat gave you an A, which is a 95.
[9038.22s -> 9043.00s]  Nobody can get a 100 that this is the cleanest yard you'll see today.
[9043.00s -> 9044.76s]  That is that's a huge deal, dude.
[9044.76s -> 9050.88s]  Because seriously, like having a fully clean yard with grass planted.
[9050.88s -> 9051.76s]  Big deal.
[9052.16s -> 9054.56s]  This took almost one third of the total time.
[9054.56s -> 9055.28s]  Yeah.
[9055.28s -> 9056.96s]  Your total final grade.
[9056.96s -> 9058.00s]  Congratulations, italics.
[9058.00s -> 9063.12s]  You are currently the head of the class with a 96.5.
[9063.12s -> 9065.26s]  I'll take it.
[9065.26s -> 9065.98s]  I appreciate it.
[9065.98s -> 9070.73s]  96.5 for italics was a hell of a job.
[9070.73s -> 9071.45s]  And nobody wins.
[9071.45s -> 9072.17s]  Did chat already vote?
[9072.81s -> 9073.13s]  Chat did.
[9073.13s -> 9074.94s]  They gave you an A.
[9074.94s -> 9075.90s]  So you're at 96.
[9075.90s -> 9077.50s]  96.5.
[9077.50s -> 9078.62s]  Well, yeah, I rounded it up.
[9078.62s -> 9081.66s]  But by the way, now that I've gotten scored, I can share my secret.
[9081.66s -> 9081.90s]  Yeah.
[9083.24s -> 9085.64s]  If you have cheats enabled and you type,
[9085.64s -> 9086.92s]  you don't even have to open a window.
[9086.92s -> 9088.68s]  You can just type it into the game.
[9088.68s -> 9089.80s]  G-R-A-V.
[9089.80s -> 9091.42s]  That's how you flip it.
[9092.48s -> 9094.80s]  That's the graph cheat that we discovered.
[9095.68s -> 9097.92s]  Before you go real quick, can you just give the philosophy
[9097.92s -> 9101.04s]  on what is going on with the red and the kind of metal here?
[9101.04s -> 9104.81s]  Because that's one thing that I'm kind of reconsidering.
[9104.81s -> 9108.91s]  Well, we were going for something that had kind of a classic vibe,
[9108.91s -> 9111.47s]  but you'll notice that it does match the interior a little bit.
[9111.47s -> 9117.47s]  Like we have this wallpaper here with the skulls, like the Day of the Dead type of skulls.
[9117.47s -> 9118.51s]  Everybody's calling you a cheater.
[9119.47s -> 9120.83s]  Yeah, that didn't work.
[9120.83s -> 9124.04s]  We're all cheaters.
[9126.92s -> 9129.48s]  Hey, I didn't say you couldn't.
[9129.48s -> 9132.76s]  I didn't say you couldn't do these things.
[9132.76s -> 9135.48s]  If anything, he spent the extra time to figure that out.
[9135.48s -> 9137.95s]  So that's the grade.
[9137.95s -> 9139.39s]  You got a 96.5.
[9139.39s -> 9144.16s]  I'm just a magician sharing my secrets so other people can enjoy.
[9146.19s -> 9148.43s]  Instead of keeping it to myself arbitrarily.
[9148.43s -> 9152.25s]  All right, we're ready for the next person.
[9152.25s -> 9154.65s]  Coming up next, whose house is next?
[9154.65s -> 9156.73s]  I believe it is Vinny.
[9157.56s -> 9159.40s]  Vinny, I believe you are next.
[9159.40s -> 9160.28s]  Thank you, Italics.
[9160.28s -> 9162.12s]  Congratulations for being head of the class so far.
[9162.12s -> 9163.16s]  I appreciate it.
[9163.16s -> 9164.36s]  Great job, Italics.
[9164.36s -> 9164.92s]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[9165.72s -> 9166.92s]  Do we want to get some...
[9166.92s -> 9167.88s]  Anybody else want to say anything?
[9167.88s -> 9169.32s]  I mean, we could do that too.
[9169.32s -> 9169.88s]  I mean, I don't know.
[9169.88s -> 9171.32s]  I want to make it extend for too long.
[9171.32s -> 9173.16s]  But what does the class think?
[9176.83s -> 9177.71s]  There was no maze.
[9178.59s -> 9179.79s]  I thought that was part of the criteria.
[9179.79s -> 9180.51s]  What was the maze?
[9180.51s -> 9181.23s]  Yeah, I was...
[9181.23s -> 9182.03s]  What was the maze?
[9182.03s -> 9182.67s]  By the way, it's no maze.
[9182.67s -> 9184.99s]  I think he's really flipped the house.
[9184.99s -> 9186.75s]  Hoke, are you still cheating?
[9186.75s -> 9188.83s]  I think cheating is not fair.
[9188.83s -> 9190.27s]  Yeah, cheating is on its land.
[9190.35s -> 9190.83s]  I'm ready.
[9190.83s -> 9192.27s]  I'm ready to say something, Hoke.
[9192.27s -> 9194.03s]  Thanks for saying something, Hoke.
[9194.03s -> 9195.23s]  That's ironic coming from the person
[9195.23s -> 9197.47s]  who got like 30 extra minutes to build compared to the rest.
[9197.47s -> 9199.39s]  I used only 20 of those.
[9200.67s -> 9202.99s]  A genuinely 20 of those.
[9202.99s -> 9204.19s]  I was at the aquarium.
[9204.19s -> 9205.63s]  He was at the aquarium, everybody.
[9205.63s -> 9206.43s]  All right, it's all right.
[9206.43s -> 9208.25s]  We gave him the time.
[9208.25s -> 9210.17s]  I do absolutely love Italics' home,
[9210.17s -> 9212.97s]  but he is missing a complete second story.
[9212.97s -> 9214.25s]  There's nothing there.
[9214.81s -> 9216.17s]  Well, but hold on.
[9216.17s -> 9216.89s]  I'll be sticking around for it.
[9216.89s -> 9217.45s]  I'm not next.
[9217.45s -> 9218.17s]  I'm not next.
[9218.17s -> 9219.05s]  I love it, though.
[9219.05s -> 9219.69s]  I love it, though.
[9219.69s -> 9220.89s]  Hold on.
[9220.89s -> 9222.65s]  But remember, we're talking about creativity
[9222.65s -> 9224.09s]  is 35% of your total grade.
[9225.44s -> 9228.00s]  I mean, flipping the house halfway through
[9228.00s -> 9229.68s]  and doing a big fucking reveal.
[9229.68s -> 9230.48s]  That was a holy.
[9231.60s -> 9232.96s]  My expectations were not going there.
[9232.96s -> 9234.16s]  I gasped, you know.
[9234.16s -> 9235.04s]  I actually was.
[9235.04s -> 9236.00s]  That was amazing.
[9236.00s -> 9237.20s]  That was amazing.
[9237.20s -> 9238.64s]  Yeah, I was just waiting for the maze.
[9238.64s -> 9241.18s]  That was the prestige.
[9241.18s -> 9242.14s]  But it was incredible.
[9242.14s -> 9243.04s]  I loved it.
[9243.04s -> 9245.84s]  Why was the bathroom not flipped like the rest of it?
[9245.84s -> 9248.64s]  Oh, the bathroom is not upside down.
[9248.64s -> 9250.40s]  They caught that too, but I didn't say anything.
[9250.40s -> 9252.00s]  The science is in there.
[9252.00s -> 9254.08s]  The science isn't there for the plumbing.
[9254.08s -> 9255.76s]  They won't let you put pipes upside down.
[9257.12s -> 9259.28s]  So I figured something was better than another.
[9259.28s -> 9260.88s]  I tried to put something in the room.
[9260.88s -> 9263.20s]  I love how somebody said House Flipper Drama is insane.
[9265.20s -> 9266.00s]  House Flipper Drama.
[9267.36s -> 9269.68s]  House Flipper Drama is insane.
[9269.68s -> 9273.02s]  House Flipper Community is going to be in shambles after tonight.
[9273.02s -> 9273.66s]  Hey, well, guess what?
[9273.66s -> 9275.02s]  This is the House Flipper Community.
[9275.02s -> 9276.06s]  We're literally all here now.
[9279.47s -> 9281.15s]  All right, let's get Vinnie in here.
[9281.15s -> 9282.59s]  So, Talos, thank you.
[9282.59s -> 9283.87s]  Thank you once again.
[9283.95s -> 9284.35s]  Thank you.
[9284.35s -> 9284.59s]  Thank you.
[9284.59s -> 9285.39s]  Appreciate it.
[9285.39s -> 9286.27s]  Chad, thanks for the A.
[9286.83s -> 9288.04s]  You're a real one.
[9288.04s -> 9289.37s]  Thanks, Talos.
[9290.11s -> 9290.99s]  So Vinnie, same deal.
[9290.99s -> 9291.87s]  I'm live, charm.
[9291.87s -> 9292.19s]  If you...
[9292.99s -> 9296.70s]  Yeah, make sure, Talos, you turn your stream off before I open this one.
[9296.70s -> 9297.66s]  And then, Vinnie, did you do the...
[9298.46s -> 9299.18s]  You know, I don't think you...
[9299.18s -> 9301.26s]  Because obviously, if you were in the United States,
[9301.26s -> 9304.20s]  I don't think we have to do the thingy.
[9304.20s -> 9305.16s]  Let me know how this looks.
[9305.16s -> 9307.74s]  I'm going to just look around and tell me if this is...
[9307.74s -> 9309.82s]  It's 30 FPS, but it should be kind of smooth.
[9309.82s -> 9311.24s]  Looks good.
[9311.24s -> 9311.88s]  All right.
[9311.88s -> 9313.56s]  All right, I am ready for you to begin.
[9313.56s -> 9314.60s]  I'm going to take your grades.
[9314.60s -> 9315.80s]  Let me just change this real quick
[9315.80s -> 9316.92s]  because these are not your grades.
[9316.92s -> 9318.91s]  These are Italics' grades.
[9318.91s -> 9320.06s]  Okay.
[9320.06s -> 9323.52s]  I will tell you when we are ready to get the tour.
[9323.52s -> 9323.84s]  Sure.
[9325.02s -> 9328.70s]  Okay. Vinnie, please begin.
[9328.70s -> 9329.98s]  Sure. Well, first of all, Jerma,
[9329.98s -> 9331.82s]  thank you so much for having me.
[9331.82s -> 9333.58s]  It's really just a pleasure to be here.
[9334.30s -> 9336.78s]  I would like to emphasize that I did not cheat
[9336.78s -> 9339.18s]  while making my house flipper house.
[9339.18s -> 9339.82s]  Okay.
[9339.82s -> 9343.76s]  And so what you'll be seeing today is legitimate.
[9345.58s -> 9346.62s]  Now, the yard isn't...
[9346.62s -> 9348.30s]  Am I getting subquitted right now?
[9348.30s -> 9350.46s]  I think we lost some quality.
[9352.14s -> 9352.70s]  Oh, really?
[9352.70s -> 9354.06s]  It looked good for the first five seconds.
[9354.06s -> 9356.06s]  Are you on 30 FPS?
[9356.06s -> 9356.92s]  Yeah.
[9356.92s -> 9357.96s]  Are you? It looks like you're at 60.
[9359.21s -> 9363.16s]  Let me try taking a quick look here.
[9363.16s -> 9364.20s]  It says 30.
[9364.20s -> 9364.92s]  Yeah.
[9364.92s -> 9368.52s]  You want me to go down to 720p or try 60?
[9368.52s -> 9375.44s]  Dude, take it down to 720.
[9375.44s -> 9377.92s]  I think the better reading mode worked pretty well.
[9377.92s -> 9378.48s]  Yeah.
[9378.48s -> 9379.92s]  Like, how do you do that?
[9379.92s -> 9383.02s]  I think if you did this a box, it's like,
[9383.02s -> 9384.54s]  see, just show text better.
[9384.54s -> 9388.43s]  It's like a checkbox you can do.
[9388.43s -> 9389.55s]  Yeah, I don't see that.
[9391.13s -> 9392.41s]  Where was I on this?
[9392.41s -> 9393.85s]  It should be on the drop down.
[9393.85s -> 9394.89s]  See how this is.
[9397.20s -> 9399.20s]  Oh, that's better.
[9399.20s -> 9401.42s]  That's better.
[9401.42s -> 9402.14s]  How we feel on this?
[9402.94s -> 9405.21s]  This looks a little better.
[9405.21s -> 9405.93s]  Yeah, I think this is good.
[9405.93s -> 9406.73s]  Yeah, I don't see it.
[9406.73s -> 9407.21s]  It's weird.
[9407.21s -> 9409.69s]  I don't see it in the drop down at all, actually.
[9409.69s -> 9410.57s]  Very strange.
[9410.57s -> 9411.29s]  I think this is good.
[9411.29s -> 9412.65s]  I think this is clear enough, I think.
[9413.76s -> 9414.96s]  Okay.
[9414.96s -> 9415.68s]  All righty.
[9415.68s -> 9417.52s]  Well, anyway, like I said, so yeah,
[9417.52s -> 9419.28s]  the yard is your basic yard.
[9419.28s -> 9420.96s]  It's just kind of, you know, natural.
[9420.96s -> 9422.24s]  It's just, I left it natural.
[9422.24s -> 9423.60s]  I gave it a little koi pond.
[9423.60s -> 9423.84s]  Okay.
[9423.84s -> 9429.60s]  Nothing special in there, but I can tell you the feature of the house is,
[9430.16s -> 9431.44s]  you know, we got some nice paint.
[9432.88s -> 9433.92s]  Let me take you inside.
[9435.80s -> 9437.48s]  So as you can see, I've got furniture.
[9438.91s -> 9440.51s]  You do have furniture.
[9440.51s -> 9441.96s]  I've got a picture of my family.
[9444.24s -> 9447.34s]  I've got my favorite ducks from Animal Crossing.
[9448.16s -> 9449.84s]  So you see, it's like a proper home.
[9449.84s -> 9455.13s]  I have, there's Simon Cowell and Howard the Duck.
[9455.13s -> 9457.61s]  So lots of important people in my life.
[9458.17s -> 9461.90s]  Okay, so this is more of a personal touch.
[9461.90s -> 9462.38s]  It is.
[9462.38s -> 9463.26s]  It's rustic.
[9463.26s -> 9465.34s]  I'm going for the rustic feel.
[9465.34s -> 9467.50s]  And you can see we even got a nice accent wall.
[9468.52s -> 9470.33s]  We don't go in this room.
[9470.33s -> 9471.29s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9471.29s -> 9471.61s]  Wait a minute.
[9471.61s -> 9471.93s]  Go back.
[9474.28s -> 9475.16s]  We don't go in this room.
[9475.16s -> 9475.96s]  What do you mean?
[9475.96s -> 9479.96s]  It's just, it's not a room I would recommend going in.
[9479.96s -> 9482.94s]  Open that door.
[9482.94s -> 9483.74s]  Open that door.
[9483.74s -> 9484.86s]  I need to see the whole house.
[9484.86s -> 9491.88s]  Okay.
[9491.88s -> 9493.16s]  Leave the, leave and close the door.
[9493.88s -> 9494.76s]  Don't show me that again.
[9495.69s -> 9501.55s]  So in here we have the hybrid kitchen and bathroom.
[9501.55s -> 9501.87s]  Okay.
[9501.87s -> 9502.91s]  So there's a shower.
[9502.91s -> 9508.08s]  So there's a nice carpet here for the bathroom kitchen.
[9509.56s -> 9512.28s]  You've got a nice toilet.
[9512.28s -> 9514.92s]  You got an iPad right next to the toilet.
[9514.92s -> 9515.24s]  Good.
[9515.24s -> 9516.20s]  You may need that.
[9516.20s -> 9517.24s]  I use it a lot.
[9517.24s -> 9519.84s]  Put that on the dishwasher right there.
[9519.84s -> 9521.74s]  Got some cabinets.
[9522.46s -> 9523.34s]  Urinal.
[9523.34s -> 9526.54s]  So when you're cooking and you're busy on the stove here,
[9526.54s -> 9528.32s]  you can take a quick piss.
[9529.26s -> 9532.73s]  Use your soap and go back to cooking.
[9532.73s -> 9535.21s]  And the carpet is just a really nice feature
[9535.21s -> 9537.21s]  because it just makes it comfortable.
[9537.21s -> 9539.29s]  Because when you're cooking and you're in a kitchen,
[9541.16s -> 9542.44s]  you're moving around a lot.
[9542.44s -> 9545.32s]  So the carpet really takes some of the,
[9545.32s -> 9548.83s]  some of the wear off of that equation.
[9548.83s -> 9549.71s]  I do appreciate,
[9549.71s -> 9551.63s]  I do appreciate the like the throw up color
[9551.63s -> 9552.75s]  that you have for the carpet.
[9552.75s -> 9554.03s]  That's very nice.
[9554.03s -> 9555.07s]  It hides all the,
[9555.07s -> 9556.83s]  it hides all the potential kitchen mess.
[9556.83s -> 9558.94s]  So you know, you spill shit on the ground.
[9558.94s -> 9560.16s]  That's fine.
[9560.16s -> 9562.75s]  And piss stains and the like.
[9562.75s -> 9564.99s]  So yeah, really, I think it's just a nice thing.
[9564.99s -> 9567.39s]  And it's really an underutilized concept.
[9567.39s -> 9569.87s]  The kitchenette, bathroom combo.
[9569.87s -> 9572.99s]  And also the Grey Leno show is the greatest late night show
[9572.99s -> 9573.63s]  of all time.
[9574.35s -> 9576.78s]  So then, as you know,
[9576.78s -> 9578.62s]  so I'll show you the upstairs real quick.
[9578.62s -> 9580.75s]  So, you know, I didn't quite-
[9580.75s -> 9583.63s]  Go back, how many times have we seen this image already?
[9583.63s -> 9585.04s]  Haven't we?
[9585.04s -> 9585.60s]  Which one?
[9585.60s -> 9586.00s]  That one.
[9586.00s -> 9588.00s]  Is, no, that's just like a type of image.
[9588.00s -> 9591.32s]  No, the one on the left.
[9591.32s -> 9592.28s]  Oh, that's just me.
[9593.21s -> 9595.50s]  Like put through a filter a couple of times.
[9595.50s -> 9597.02s]  I just thought it would be nice to have that there.
[9597.02s -> 9598.54s]  Connor, are you, you're watching right now, right?
[9599.42s -> 9605.02s]  There's a version of my face that has this same face
[9605.02s -> 9606.78s]  on his Japanese Google.
[9606.78s -> 9608.62s]  Yeah, not on Japanese Google.
[9608.62s -> 9609.02s]  Sorry.
[9609.02s -> 9609.50s]  Oh, okay.
[9611.15s -> 9611.63s]  Oh, okay.
[9611.63s -> 9612.81s]  All right.
[9612.81s -> 9615.29s]  I do like the, I love, before you say anything,
[9615.85s -> 9617.55s]  I love the wallpaper.
[9617.55s -> 9618.43s]  I think it's very fun.
[9618.43s -> 9619.15s]  Oh, thanks.
[9619.15s -> 9622.04s]  It's cool.
[9622.68s -> 9625.96s]  Yeah, there's definitely a nice vibe to the room.
[9625.96s -> 9628.36s]  I tried to find sand flooring, but I like this better.
[9629.24s -> 9630.28s]  I have some photos.
[9630.28s -> 9632.84s]  I was going to do a little photo gallery of the evolution
[9632.84s -> 9637.50s]  of our image together from acts like six years ago,
[9637.50s -> 9640.70s]  five years ago, to the most recent thing,
[9640.70s -> 9641.58s]  because we're buddies.
[9641.58s -> 9643.58s]  You know, me, you and Kraikin, we're good buddies.
[9643.58s -> 9644.08s]  Yeah.
[9645.64s -> 9650.28s]  And so anyway, this is my alien, Nortz, and he's smiling.
[9650.28s -> 9654.06s]  Here's the gamer chair, the desk.
[9655.60s -> 9656.88s]  Back to the gamer chair.
[9656.88s -> 9658.48s]  There's a gun next to the gamer chair.
[9658.48s -> 9660.08s]  I'm just, I'm just asking a question.
[9662.09s -> 9662.89s]  What do you want to know about it?
[9662.89s -> 9665.98s]  Why is there a gun next to the gamer chair?
[9665.98s -> 9669.18s]  Why isn't there a gun next to the gamer chair?
[9669.18s -> 9673.66s]  Okay, fair, fair, okay, okay, fair.
[9673.66s -> 9677.18s]  Um, here's the bed and, uh.
[9677.18s -> 9677.90s]  Why is there mirrors?
[9677.90s -> 9680.14s]  Surrounding, surrounding mirrors.
[9681.84s -> 9685.28s]  Well, this is, I mean, this is the implication,
[9685.28s -> 9686.56s]  really, more than anything.
[9686.56s -> 9688.00s]  Are you a vampire?
[9688.00s -> 9692.22s]  I mean, some, some would say a sex vampire.
[9692.22s -> 9694.06s]  Who, who can't see the vampires,
[9694.06s -> 9695.26s]  can't see the reflection or something?
[9695.26s -> 9696.94s]  Why would you have mirrors everywhere?
[9700.65s -> 9701.29s]  Wait a second.
[9702.25s -> 9702.97s]  Wait a second.
[9702.97s -> 9704.65s]  Uh, uh, this is clicking right now.
[9704.65s -> 9706.65s]  This is clicking right now.
[9706.65s -> 9706.89s]  Um.
[9706.89s -> 9707.45s]  Cool.
[9707.45s -> 9709.56s]  But what do you think it is?
[9709.56s -> 9713.74s]  Are you, are these all here for you to-
[9713.74s -> 9715.42s]  So anyway, down this way,
[9715.42s -> 9719.92s]  I'll show you another, uh, cool, uh, feature of the house.
[9719.92s -> 9722.56s]  So, you know, there's toilets pretty much in every main room.
[9724.25s -> 9727.74s]  But then here we have, probably,
[9728.30s -> 9730.28s]  I don't know, the grimace room, you could call it.
[9730.28s -> 9734.40s]  There was an accident happened here.
[9734.40s -> 9736.75s]  But, uh, there is a toilet and-
[9738.27s -> 9739.63s]  We'll go back to the wall.
[9739.63s -> 9740.43s]  Go back to the wall.
[9741.15s -> 9745.61s]  That, that, is that, that's Mr., is that Mr. Dink?
[9745.61s -> 9747.71s]  Yeah.
[9747.71s -> 9748.59s]  Well, he's purple.
[9748.59s -> 9750.59s]  And I feel like him and grimace probably had,
[9750.59s -> 9752.78s]  like, something to do with each other.
[9752.78s -> 9756.03s]  I don't know what, but I'm, I'm trying to find out the connection.
[9756.03s -> 9758.59s]  Vinnie, Vinnie, I wanna, I wanna interject for a second here.
[9758.59s -> 9761.63s]  I do have to drop a couple points on philosophy and creativity
[9761.63s -> 9763.31s]  because I'm saying, I'm seeing a theme that,
[9763.31s -> 9765.23s]  did you paint the outside of the house purple
[9765.23s -> 9766.99s]  because this grimace room existed?
[9766.99s -> 9768.99s]  And that was the first thing you did.
[9768.99s -> 9773.04s]  And then you said, shit, I can't just make a grimace house.
[9773.04s -> 9774.72s]  No, I started with the grimace room.
[9774.72s -> 9776.48s]  That, yeah, that's what I, okay.
[9776.48s -> 9781.28s]  Yeah, I knew the grimace room would have to be, like, really important to the room.
[9781.28s -> 9781.52s]  Okay.
[9781.52s -> 9783.28s]  And, uh, we got the summoning circle here.
[9783.28s -> 9789.07s]  Well, it's more of a summoning cube, but it worked.
[9789.07s -> 9791.55s]  And so, uh, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it.
[9791.55s -> 9793.71s]  I don't have anything of note to show you back here
[9793.71s -> 9796.11s]  because I spent a lot of time trying to get-
[9796.83s -> 9797.63s]  Can you go to the garage?
[9797.63s -> 9799.07s]  This all rustic and nice.
[9799.07s -> 9799.87s]  There's nothing in there.
[9800.83s -> 9802.19s]  But can you go to the left of the garage?
[9806.00s -> 9810.14s]  Oh, Vinnie, oh, Vinnie, Vinnie.
[9812.84s -> 9813.72s]  Oh, Vinnie.
[9814.36s -> 9815.69s]  It's dirty back there.
[9817.00s -> 9819.58s]  It's pretty dirty back there.
[9819.58s -> 9822.86s]  Hey, Jerma, can you take a look on Japanese Google real quick
[9822.86s -> 9826.14s]  and check, um, for a photo of you, if you wouldn't mind?
[9829.34s -> 9833.66s]  Anyway, so, yeah, the Mr. Dink connection is really,
[9833.66s -> 9835.50s]  oh, really interesting, isn't it?
[9835.50s -> 9836.38s]  That connection between-
[9836.38s -> 9838.06s]  I actually do like the Mr. Dink.
[9838.06s -> 9840.62s]  Oh, I forgot to play the dramatic sound from Hell's Kitchen.
[9840.62s -> 9842.80s]  Hold on.
[9842.80s -> 9853.07s]  Ah, this, you've got lots of dirt back there.
[9853.07s -> 9854.91s]  I thought that was the YouTube video that I just opened.
[9855.39s -> 9857.60s]  Okay, that was-
[9857.60s -> 9861.37s]  Listen, I'm happy that you're here in my house.
[9861.37s -> 9863.05s]  I thought that was a different YouTube video.
[9863.05s -> 9864.01s]  I just tried to play the-
[9864.01s -> 9864.97s]  Okay, all right, here we go.
[9865.61s -> 9867.95s]  Vinnie, good shit.
[9867.95s -> 9869.31s]  I liked your philosophy.
[9869.31s -> 9870.75s]  I thought your creativity was great.
[9870.75s -> 9874.67s]  I love the fact that you have your multi-kitchen bathroom area.
[9874.67s -> 9875.23s]  Fantastic.
[9875.23s -> 9878.22s]  I'm going to give you an extra point in philosophy on that one.
[9878.22s -> 9880.06s]  Your cleanliness could be a little bit higher.
[9880.06s -> 9881.90s]  I'll give you a 90 because it was just that one area.
[9881.90s -> 9884.22s]  But, I mean, actually, never mind.
[9884.22s -> 9885.58s]  You shouldn't have shown me that room more than once
[9886.38s -> 9888.30s]  because I forgot it existed in this blood all over the walls.
[9888.30s -> 9889.34s]  You got a C in cleanliness.
[9890.20s -> 9891.64s]  All right, so here you go.
[9891.64s -> 9894.36s]  Jack, what are you going to give Vinnie's house?
[9895.56s -> 9896.68s]  A, B, C, or D?
[9897.24s -> 9900.62s]  Because right now, Vinnie, you're looking at a-
[9901.66s -> 9903.50s]  Somewhere around a B, it seems like.
[9903.50s -> 9904.22s]  No, no, no.
[9904.22s -> 9904.86s]  Hang on.
[9904.86s -> 9906.30s]  Here, I was doing this earlier.
[9906.30s -> 9907.42s]  I'm going to play an A chord.
[9907.98s -> 9911.80s]  Oh, it's a little out of tune, but don't worry.
[9911.80s -> 9913.00s]  I promised you that was an A chord.
[9913.64s -> 9916.68s]  Wait, before you do this, go to your volume and turn the music volume down.
[9917.98s -> 9920.20s]  No, it's okay.
[9920.20s -> 9922.84s]  Wait, if I say no to the host, does that minus points?
[9922.84s -> 9923.72s]  No, no, you're good.
[9924.52s -> 9925.00s]  You can disagree.
[9927.80s -> 9929.24s]  All right, what do we got for a chat grade?
[9932.12s -> 9934.68s]  Ooh, they're being pretty nice to you.
[9935.88s -> 9936.52s]  Thank you, Chad.
[9937.56s -> 9938.52s]  That's really kind of you.
[9940.56s -> 9941.60s]  Listen, I'll take a B.
[9941.60s -> 9942.72s]  That doesn't matter.
[9942.72s -> 9946.08s]  But I'm just happy that I have a house that has furniture in it
[9946.08s -> 9950.25s]  that isn't, you know, upside down.
[9950.25s -> 9952.89s]  Because listen, I wouldn't want to live like that, would you?
[9952.89s -> 9953.37s]  I don't know.
[9954.49s -> 9957.45s]  And I'm really happy that I can sit on my couch and chill
[9957.45s -> 9959.29s]  and watch a little tiny TV over there.
[9959.29s -> 9960.81s]  And then if I need to go to the bathroom,
[9961.13s -> 9962.41s]  I got my iPad here.
[9963.21s -> 9965.69s]  And then I can also cook while I'm in the bathroom.
[9965.69s -> 9966.65s]  It's really, really nice.
[9966.65s -> 9967.61s]  Saves a lot of time.
[9967.61s -> 9969.37s]  The iPad gave you extra points, by the way.
[9969.37s -> 9969.93s]  Be curious.
[9972.89s -> 9974.09s]  All right, what do we got?
[9974.09s -> 9976.57s]  We are at, you are getting,
[9977.45s -> 9979.93s]  the vote is pretty much locked in at this point.
[9979.93s -> 9981.37s]  Although a lot of people want to give you an A,
[9981.37s -> 9983.93s]  but it seems like the class is going to give you a B.
[9985.63s -> 9988.73s]  So listen, it is a tough act to follow.
[9988.73s -> 9991.28s]  It's Alex, you did something amazing.
[9991.28s -> 9996.01s]  House, whether or not I, that's a tough act to follow.
[9996.01s -> 10000.14s]  Vinny, Vinny, I think you might be pleasantly surprised by this grade.
[10002.91s -> 10005.23s]  You got an 83.8.
[10005.23s -> 10008.84s]  I'll take it.
[10008.84s -> 10010.28s]  You got a solid B.
[10010.28s -> 10011.16s]  That's a solid B.
[10011.88s -> 10014.04s]  I'll take it.
[10014.04s -> 10014.68s]  Very nice.
[10014.68s -> 10015.24s]  Very clean.
[10015.24s -> 10016.12s]  I like the philosophy.
[10016.76s -> 10017.79s]  Thanks.
[10017.79s -> 10018.27s]  Excellent.
[10018.27s -> 10018.67s]  Excellent.
[10018.67s -> 10019.07s]  Excellent.
[10020.28s -> 10021.80s]  If you could hit escape and go to your options
[10021.80s -> 10023.24s]  and turn the volume down on your music.
[10023.96s -> 10029.42s]  Turn down.
[10029.42s -> 10030.54s]  Oh, there you go.
[10030.54s -> 10031.26s]  All right.
[10031.26s -> 10033.42s]  Can we get, anybody have anything to say?
[10034.14s -> 10035.42s]  Yeah, I think you got robbed.
[10035.42s -> 10036.86s]  I think that was easily an A house.
[10038.40s -> 10039.60s]  I agree.
[10039.60s -> 10040.24s]  I loved it.
[10040.24s -> 10040.72s]  Thank you.
[10040.72s -> 10043.60s]  I quite appreciate the crime scene and all the blood on the walls.
[10044.40s -> 10044.88s]  Thank you.
[10044.88s -> 10047.60s]  Like, you know, it really adds something unexpected in your home.
[10047.60s -> 10049.52s]  You know, Jeremy, if we have a private room, do you,
[10049.52s -> 10052.00s]  is it really your right to barge in there and start looking around?
[10053.12s -> 10054.16s]  Oh, shit.
[10054.16s -> 10055.36s]  That's a good point.
[10055.36s -> 10055.68s]  Yeah.
[10058.30s -> 10059.90s]  If we have a private room.
[10059.90s -> 10060.54s]  I'm sorry, Vinny.
[10061.58s -> 10062.78s]  He didn't want that to be seen.
[10063.42s -> 10066.70s]  How come they didn't do like a New York City box apartment?
[10067.90s -> 10070.35s]  What was the maze, actually?
[10070.35s -> 10072.27s]  No, I'm sorry to say there is no maze.
[10072.27s -> 10073.23s]  I enjoyed your maze.
[10073.23s -> 10074.35s]  Yeah, no maze.
[10074.35s -> 10074.59s]  Yeah.
[10076.75s -> 10077.07s]  Yeah.
[10077.07s -> 10078.83s]  There was a maze category.
[10079.87s -> 10081.47s]  I also added an image of Japanese Google,
[10081.47s -> 10084.43s]  just in case you were confused in the chat.
[10084.43s -> 10085.23s]  You can see it.
[10085.23s -> 10087.84s]  Cool.
[10087.84s -> 10088.00s]  All right.
[10088.00s -> 10088.96s]  So we got, who's up next?
[10089.76s -> 10090.08s]  Yeah.
[10090.08s -> 10090.64s]  Thanks, Vinny.
[10090.64s -> 10092.57s]  It was an awesome job.
[10092.57s -> 10092.97s]  Thanks for coming out.
[10092.97s -> 10093.77s]  I'm going to get going, too.
[10093.77s -> 10094.81s]  So have a good one, everybody.
[10094.81s -> 10095.21s]  Good luck.
[10095.21s -> 10095.61s]  Good luck.
[10095.61s -> 10095.93s]  Bye.
[10095.93s -> 10096.49s]  Thanks, Vinny.
[10096.49s -> 10097.61s]  Take care.
[10097.61s -> 10098.41s]  Later.
[10098.41s -> 10099.29s]  Vinny's a good lad.
[10099.61s -> 10100.25s]  All right.
[10100.25s -> 10101.05s]  Who's up next?
[10101.05s -> 10102.57s]  I think it's either Polk or Ludwig, right?
[10102.57s -> 10104.57s]  Who's, any of you two need to dip?
[10104.57s -> 10106.09s]  You want to get it over with or?
[10108.44s -> 10108.92s]  I'm ready.
[10109.56s -> 10110.12s]  Oh, no, no.
[10110.12s -> 10112.20s]  Yeah, Kraken, it is you because you do have to dip.
[10112.20s -> 10113.08s]  Yeah, Kraken has to dip.
[10113.08s -> 10120.38s]  So why can I still hear this music?
[10121.26s -> 10124.08s]  Is this from my camera?
[10127.56s -> 10128.36s]  Oh, it's Vinny.
[10128.36s -> 10129.72s]  Vinny's still live.
[10129.72s -> 10130.92s]  He's like still doing it.
[10132.68s -> 10135.08s]  So we're going to tell Vinny to, all right.
[10135.08s -> 10137.96s]  Let's tell Vinny that he has to stop screen sharing.
[10138.68s -> 10143.16s]  Okay, there we go.
[10143.72s -> 10145.85s]  All right, Kraken, are you ready?
[10145.85s -> 10146.49s]  Yeah.
[10146.49s -> 10148.68s]  Let's just do a quick little move around test.
[10148.68s -> 10153.61s]  I think it looks all right.
[10153.61s -> 10156.65s]  Okay, we are ready for Kraken's house.
[10158.43s -> 10160.04s]  Take it away, Kraken.
[10160.04s -> 10160.84s]  Welcome, everyone.
[10161.48s -> 10163.16s]  Yeah, this is my house.
[10164.20s -> 10166.36s]  Yeah, first time in this game.
[10167.16s -> 10169.08s]  So, you know, learned a lot on the fly.
[10169.08s -> 10170.60s]  And I know the first thing you're thinking is,
[10171.16s -> 10173.88s]  yeah, you know, compared to some of the other yards,
[10173.88s -> 10175.40s]  this seems like it's a little bit messy.
[10175.40s -> 10176.76s]  This is kind of dirty, Kraken.
[10176.76s -> 10177.88s]  This is very dirty.
[10179.58s -> 10180.86s]  And you'd be right.
[10180.86s -> 10183.34s]  But also, what if I told you it was intentional
[10183.34s -> 10184.94s]  and that some of this trash was left here
[10184.94s -> 10187.58s]  with a very important message?
[10188.38s -> 10189.90s]  Okay, well, I'm going to have, honestly,
[10189.90s -> 10192.22s]  I'm going to have to start you out at like a 60 for cleanliness
[10192.22s -> 10193.74s]  just because of what we know so far,
[10193.74s -> 10195.64s]  but I'm willing to change it.
[10195.64s -> 10198.20s]  And that's all I'm looking to hear, all right?
[10198.20s -> 10199.64s]  Just, you know, open mind.
[10199.64s -> 10204.49s]  And that's that what you see here, huh, a fallout shelter.
[10205.29s -> 10208.09s]  Are you saying that maybe something like
[10208.89s -> 10212.09s]  this world that we're in is kind of a post-apocalyptic one,
[10212.09s -> 10216.33s]  per chance, and maybe there is like some mess out here
[10216.33s -> 10219.69s]  left from, you know, the fucking fall of humanity?
[10220.25s -> 10220.73s]  Okay.
[10220.73s -> 10222.09s]  Have you thought about that?
[10222.09s -> 10223.37s]  I have thought about it.
[10223.37s -> 10225.21s]  I'm also thinking about potentially you
[10225.21s -> 10226.73s]  forgetting how much time is left and just going,
[10226.73s -> 10227.85s]  oh, shit, there's a lot of trash outside.
[10227.85s -> 10230.56s]  I have to pretend I have to come up with a story.
[10230.56s -> 10233.04s]  Or maybe this was the point all along.
[10233.04s -> 10234.96s]  And let me welcome you inside too.
[10236.32s -> 10238.72s]  Are you familiar, by the way, with the whole,
[10238.72s -> 10240.40s]  you know, Barbie movie, Oppenheimer,
[10241.52s -> 10243.36s]  kind of, you know, double feature thing
[10243.36s -> 10245.04s]  that's been going on the internet, very topical.
[10245.04s -> 10247.45s]  Everyone's all looking forward to it.
[10247.45s -> 10250.33s]  I know that the Barbie movie is coming out.
[10250.33s -> 10254.49s]  And the Oppenheimer movie is coming out the same day.
[10254.49s -> 10255.61s]  Oh, it's coming out the same day.
[10255.61s -> 10255.93s]  All right.
[10255.93s -> 10256.49s]  Okay, I get it.
[10256.49s -> 10256.81s]  I get it.
[10256.81s -> 10257.13s]  I get it.
[10257.13s -> 10257.77s]  That's the whole thing.
[10258.73s -> 10262.57s]  So I thought, what if we made a fallout shelter, right?
[10262.57s -> 10266.41s]  Because Oppenheimer, that was themed after Barbie.
[10268.24s -> 10269.68s]  Oh, okay.
[10270.40s -> 10271.04s]  Yeah, let it come.
[10271.04s -> 10271.84s]  All right.
[10271.84s -> 10273.04s]  We're still percolating here.
[10273.04s -> 10274.00s]  So welcome on in.
[10274.00s -> 10275.60s]  This is the first room we have.
[10276.24s -> 10280.80s]  And you'll see that there's each room in this house is themed
[10281.53s -> 10285.93s]  after a different, just kind of fun concept, right?
[10285.93s -> 10288.81s]  Something that I think Barbie would enjoy
[10288.81s -> 10291.55s]  or you'd want in a fallout shelter
[10291.55s -> 10297.02s]  should the Oppenheimer bombs fall, you know, at any minute.
[10297.02s -> 10298.30s]  So this is the first one.
[10298.30s -> 10299.18s]  Any questions?
[10299.18s -> 10300.06s]  Feel free to ask.
[10300.06s -> 10301.10s]  I have one question.
[10301.10s -> 10303.42s]  And it is, did you and Vinnie use the same wallpaper?
[10306.33s -> 10308.01s]  I don't think he used this one, did he?
[10308.01s -> 10312.57s]  I will say there's a good chance this wallpaper.
[10312.57s -> 10312.97s]  Yes.
[10312.97s -> 10314.17s]  No, we did use the same.
[10314.17s -> 10316.65s]  You'll notice there's more than one wallpaper in this house.
[10316.65s -> 10320.73s]  And that's because, like I mentioned, each is a different theme.
[10320.73s -> 10322.81s]  And so this is the neon room.
[10322.81s -> 10323.31s]  Okay.
[10323.85s -> 10327.13s]  We have a little TV here, like, you know, TV Mike from Willy Wonka.
[10327.13s -> 10327.61s]  What happened here?
[10327.61s -> 10328.81s]  And hop over this.
[10328.81s -> 10329.29s]  What happened here?
[10329.29s -> 10330.89s]  Well, this is the fish room, as you can see.
[10332.38s -> 10335.02s]  So we have a little fish here in the corner.
[10335.02s -> 10337.20s]  And that's it.
[10337.20s -> 10339.12s]  Now we can move on to this is the love room.
[10339.68s -> 10340.64s]  This is the love room.
[10341.20s -> 10341.60s]  Yes.
[10342.16s -> 10342.40s]  Yeah.
[10342.96s -> 10343.92s]  We got fairy lights.
[10343.92s -> 10346.64s]  We got some chocolate and...
[10346.64s -> 10348.88s]  Is there a reason why the chocolate and the lights
[10348.88s -> 10354.84s]  are not on a structure of any kind?
[10354.84s -> 10356.68s]  Like on a table?
[10356.68s -> 10357.16s]  Yeah.
[10357.16s -> 10358.60s]  We only had one of those nets for the fish.
[10358.60s -> 10359.10s]  Okay.
[10360.60s -> 10365.00s]  Turns out it takes a lot of time to keep adding, you know,
[10365.00s -> 10365.96s]  furniture.
[10365.96s -> 10372.20s]  And it's better to focus, in my mind, on the philosophy and the spirit of a room
[10372.20s -> 10375.88s]  than on the actual, you know, amenities.
[10375.88s -> 10377.88s]  So I can do something real quick for me right now.
[10377.88s -> 10379.08s]  Just very quickly.
[10379.08s -> 10379.32s]  Yeah.
[10379.32s -> 10389.39s]  Take out your mop and mop the floor for a second.
[10389.39s -> 10390.59s]  That's the floor, baby.
[10390.59s -> 10392.43s]  That's just what it looks like, guys.
[10392.43s -> 10392.75s]  Yeah.
[10392.75s -> 10394.99s]  This was by design.
[10397.48s -> 10401.32s]  I appreciate you checking, though, that my lovely floor was not dirty.
[10402.12s -> 10402.44s]  Okay.
[10402.44s -> 10404.28s]  Definitely didn't hurt.
[10404.28s -> 10404.68s]  Okay.
[10404.68s -> 10407.24s]  Well, speaking of amenities, this is the snow room.
[10408.19s -> 10412.11s]  We have a friend and snow is cold.
[10412.11s -> 10416.60s]  So we have a, you know, a fridge, which is also used in fallout shelters
[10416.60s -> 10418.60s]  to escape bombs like in Indiana Jones.
[10418.60s -> 10420.28s]  So I love it.
[10420.28s -> 10421.92s]  I love the snow room.
[10421.92s -> 10422.64s]  Great.
[10422.64s -> 10426.32s]  Moving on, we have this is the neon room.
[10427.52s -> 10432.16s]  And over here in the corner, we have my little rat friends.
[10433.20s -> 10437.68s]  They have their water bowl and a nice little bed.
[10437.68s -> 10439.68s]  Of course, we keep our cool.
[10439.68s -> 10441.92s]  We don't want them to get out and make a mess.
[10441.92s -> 10443.44s]  So we take them out one at a time.
[10443.44s -> 10445.20s]  Something happened with the wallpaper back there.
[10445.20s -> 10446.80s]  There's some wallpaper issues I see.
[10446.80s -> 10450.11s]  There's also some structural complexity issues.
[10450.11s -> 10454.59s]  I think that are maybe bringing a little bit of the points down.
[10456.06s -> 10458.68s]  Go back in this room and look to the right.
[10458.68s -> 10459.40s]  Oh, you mean?
[10459.40s -> 10464.38s]  Yeah, I'm seeing a little bit of snow tends to blow, right?
[10464.46s -> 10466.54s]  And so I just thought it'd be kind of fun to show
[10466.54s -> 10469.50s]  that it gets around the house sometimes, you know, in the right mood.
[10470.14s -> 10474.54s]  Speaking of, look, we can fill the rat's cage with food.
[10474.54s -> 10475.74s]  That's a cute thing, right?
[10475.74s -> 10476.46s]  Look at that.
[10476.46s -> 10481.10s]  Honestly, first person to incorporate an animal like an animal enclosure.
[10481.10s -> 10482.06s]  We've seen a couple of rats,
[10482.06s -> 10484.30s]  but we have not seen an actual animal enclosure yet.
[10484.30s -> 10486.14s]  So I'm going to have to give you some points.
[10486.14s -> 10487.76s]  They have comfortable space.
[10489.40s -> 10494.04s]  Moving on, we have now we're entering the dog room.
[10495.69s -> 10496.57s]  Good dog.
[10496.57s -> 10497.61s]  Can I stop here for one second?
[10498.49s -> 10500.65s]  You started this with a philosophy of 95
[10500.65s -> 10505.13s]  because you told me at the entrance that this was a Barbie Oppenheimer house.
[10505.13s -> 10507.98s]  Did that change in your process?
[10507.98s -> 10509.18s]  Give me your philosophy on this.
[10509.18s -> 10511.98s]  Did that change halfway through?
[10511.98s -> 10513.34s]  May I counter you with this?
[10513.34s -> 10514.78s]  Does Barbie not have a dog?
[10514.78s -> 10516.25s]  I don't know.
[10516.25s -> 10517.29s]  Does Barbie have a dog?
[10517.29s -> 10519.74s]  I don't know either, but probably, right?
[10519.74s -> 10521.90s]  So this is the good dog room.
[10523.02s -> 10524.46s]  I was thinking of all the fun things
[10524.46s -> 10527.98s]  that Barbie would like to have in her playhouse, you know?
[10528.22s -> 10530.94s]  And so I couldn't find many props related to dogs.
[10530.94s -> 10533.02s]  So I do have a nice dog light down here,
[10533.02s -> 10535.02s]  but that's all we got.
[10535.02s -> 10539.26s]  So over here, every good house needs a toilet.
[10540.78s -> 10544.04s]  This is an outhouse that you put behind this?
[10544.04s -> 10544.28s]  Yeah.
[10544.28s -> 10546.52s]  Well, we didn't have plumbing working,
[10547.08s -> 10549.64s]  so I did have to just kind of drill a hole in the wall
[10549.64s -> 10550.60s]  and throw the outhouse outside.
[10550.60s -> 10552.44s]  We also have the piss buckets for the overflow.
[10552.44s -> 10553.96s]  Oh, those are pee?
[10553.96s -> 10555.64s]  You're not getting higher than a 60 in cleanliness.
[10555.64s -> 10556.28s]  This is not happening.
[10556.28s -> 10556.92s]  I'm sorry, Kraken.
[10556.92s -> 10558.04s]  We have buckets for them.
[10558.04s -> 10559.64s]  They're not on the ground.
[10559.64s -> 10561.72s]  I can show you the broom thing again if you want to confirm,
[10561.72s -> 10562.84s]  but they aren't, you know.
[10563.40s -> 10565.48s]  I'm going to give you some points in creativity
[10565.48s -> 10567.32s]  because that's actually funny,
[10568.28s -> 10570.68s]  but you're not getting higher than a 60 in cleanliness.
[10570.68s -> 10571.72s]  It's just impossible.
[10571.72s -> 10573.24s]  Just wait till you see the rest of the place,
[10573.24s -> 10575.40s]  and I think maybe you'll be changing your tune.
[10575.40s -> 10575.88s]  Okay.
[10575.88s -> 10577.64s]  Speaking of cleanliness, this is the plant room.
[10578.92s -> 10580.51s]  I know you said that you were excited
[10580.51s -> 10583.39s]  that there was a garden from one of the earlier contestants,
[10583.39s -> 10586.59s]  and I thought, what about if the garden was inside?
[10586.59s -> 10589.87s]  And also, in case the zombies come,
[10590.19s -> 10591.95s]  this is, again, a fallout shelter at the end of the day,
[10591.95s -> 10597.07s]  and so we have an ammo box and machine gun just for guarding the place.
[10597.07s -> 10601.39s]  You know what I think would really help stop an intrusion by zombies?
[10601.39s -> 10603.07s]  It's having full walls.
[10603.07s -> 10604.67s]  I think that would help
[10605.71s -> 10607.71s]  with maybe a weapon aiming from a different floor.
[10609.63s -> 10611.95s]  So I'm going to have to give you a little bit of a doc on that.
[10611.95s -> 10614.25s]  Now, what if I threw this out there?
[10614.25s -> 10616.38s]  Plants versus zombies.
[10621.96s -> 10623.48s]  I gave you a point in philosophy for that.
[10623.48s -> 10624.44s]  All right, great.
[10624.68s -> 10626.84s]  Moving on, this is the Mexico room.
[10626.84s -> 10635.34s]  We have kind of the Day of the Dead theme with this garland and little skull,
[10635.34s -> 10638.86s]  and then over here, a full-on spooky guy.
[10640.94s -> 10644.30s]  I just really want to make sure that each room here felt like its own world.
[10644.30s -> 10647.98s]  Its own world, just like the Barbie in the Oppenheimer movie.
[10648.70s -> 10650.38s]  Now you can see my vision.
[10651.60s -> 10654.80s]  Then I got back on track with the theme of the Oppenheimer thing
[10654.80s -> 10659.85s]  with like a kind of a like a generator, gas generator, right?
[10660.65s -> 10663.05s]  Some boots, which you would probably need in the wasteland.
[10663.87s -> 10667.87s]  Moving on, we have a cute cat portrait that I found on the shop
[10667.87s -> 10671.55s]  and just couldn't help but put in the very cute in my building.
[10671.55s -> 10673.69s]  Yeah, it's very cute.
[10673.69s -> 10674.97s]  This is the brooding corner.
[10675.93s -> 10678.01s]  I was really with the guns.
[10678.01s -> 10680.76s]  Everybody has like a gun with a chair.
[10680.76s -> 10685.64s]  Well, you would you naturally hang your gun up when you, you know,
[10685.64s -> 10690.06s]  are like kicking back and just reminds you of your own mortality like Oppenheimer does.
[10690.86s -> 10692.78s]  That movie I believe is going to be a bit dark.
[10692.78s -> 10694.38s]  So I thought a nice little brooding corner would be good.
[10694.38s -> 10696.62s]  This little spider over there though to keep it keep it light.
[10697.64s -> 10700.76s]  And then this of course is bringing us to the end of the tour,
[10702.04s -> 10704.60s]  which by the way, I don't know if you noticed this was a maze the whole time.
[10704.60s -> 10705.96s]  I was gonna say, where are the doors?
[10706.52s -> 10710.17s]  Somebody said, does Barbie not have doors?
[10710.17s -> 10718.28s]  The doors were made because as I mentioned, someone, me,
[10719.08s -> 10722.12s]  this is their first experience with this game and first built the walls.
[10722.12s -> 10725.40s]  And then later didn't realize the doors were a thing until after,
[10726.60s -> 10728.20s]  you know, using the sledgehammer tool.
[10728.20s -> 10732.68s]  But I think it adds to kind of the rustic feel of, you know,
[10732.68s -> 10734.04s]  finding your way through a maze, right?
[10734.60s -> 10738.20s]  You sort of did the reverse of, oh my God, mom and dad are coming home.
[10738.20s -> 10739.96s]  We have to clean up the place.
[10739.96s -> 10743.00s]  So you kind of did like, oh my God, mom and dad are coming home.
[10743.00s -> 10745.61s]  We have to build a fucking house.
[10745.61s -> 10745.77s]  Yeah.
[10745.77s -> 10748.17s]  And that's how this is what you could come up with.
[10748.17s -> 10749.85s]  That's kind of that's pretty accurate.
[10750.25s -> 10753.13s]  I also think though, there's some cool parallel, you know,
[10753.13s -> 10754.41s]  comparison of the rats, right?
[10754.41s -> 10755.61s]  Rats in a maze.
[10755.61s -> 10757.21s]  And then here we are in a maze.
[10758.14s -> 10760.22s]  And so that's probably worth a couple of points.
[10760.22s -> 10763.66s]  You know, is this 90s themed?
[10763.66s -> 10764.78s]  Is this 90s themed?
[10764.78s -> 10765.74s]  Is this 90s themed?
[10768.70s -> 10770.57s]  This room, yes.
[10772.08s -> 10773.60s]  This room, yes.
[10774.24s -> 10775.95s]  This room, yes.
[10777.55s -> 10779.55s]  This room is kind of timeless, I think, though.
[10779.55s -> 10781.39s]  So, you know, take that as you will.
[10781.39s -> 10781.87s]  All right.
[10781.87s -> 10784.59s]  Finally, though, we got to go to the we got to go to the upstairs.
[10784.59s -> 10787.00s]  See, because I want to see upstairs.
[10787.00s -> 10791.76s]  Well, feast your eyes on the point of this whole maze.
[10794.68s -> 10795.96s]  All about good vibes over here.
[10795.96s -> 10799.88s]  And so what is better than good vibes, especially at the end of the world,
[10799.88s -> 10801.56s]  at the the apocalypse of time?
[10802.76s -> 10805.64s]  We know toilet paper is going to be the most valuable thing.
[10805.64s -> 10812.20s]  So I just wanted to kind of pay homage to that and have kind of a nice,
[10812.20s -> 10814.52s]  you know, denouement, if you will,
[10814.52s -> 10816.84s]  kind of wrapping everything up here as you come to the top.
[10816.84s -> 10819.48s]  You did get a point in cleanliness because of the toilet paper there.
[10819.48s -> 10820.76s]  So there's one point in cleanliness.
[10820.76s -> 10822.59s]  You got a 61, a 61.
[10822.59s -> 10822.91s]  Great.
[10822.91s -> 10823.95s]  Well, I'll take that.
[10825.71s -> 10826.03s]  All right.
[10827.79s -> 10828.99s]  Can you look at the ceiling?
[10828.99s -> 10830.88s]  OK.
[10830.88s -> 10831.60s]  Look down.
[10831.60s -> 10833.80s]  OK.
[10833.80s -> 10835.32s]  I just was seeing what was on the ground.
[10835.32s -> 10840.24s]  If you had anything, was this default, the default floor on the ground?
[10840.24s -> 10843.77s]  Well, I think since I went through a lot of effort
[10844.41s -> 10846.73s]  putting up wallpaper on literally every other wall,
[10847.45s -> 10850.09s]  I really I kind of thought the ending being a more
[10850.97s -> 10854.91s]  minimal kind of, you know, good vibe room.
[10854.91s -> 10855.23s]  OK.
[10855.95s -> 10858.67s]  Would just would just kind of tie the whole thing together and
[10859.95s -> 10861.23s]  you know, I didn't want to overdo it.
[10861.23s -> 10861.87s]  Can we get chat?
[10861.87s -> 10863.23s]  Can we get chat to give a grade of this house?
[10863.23s -> 10864.19s]  What do you guys think?
[10864.19s -> 10865.47s]  A, B, C, D.
[10865.47s -> 10866.75s]  We don't give F's here.
[10866.75s -> 10870.78s]  All right, Kraken, I can tell you what I got over here so far.
[10870.78s -> 10871.90s]  I got you at an 80.
[10871.90s -> 10874.54s]  I got you an 85 for creativity because you really pulled me in
[10874.54s -> 10876.22s]  with the whole Oppenheimer Barbie house.
[10876.86s -> 10877.34s]  Yeah.
[10877.34s -> 10880.38s]  And I dropped some scores elsewhere because it turned out
[10880.38s -> 10881.98s]  that that was just a bait and switch.
[10881.98s -> 10884.22s]  And you you grabbed us.
[10884.22s -> 10888.04s]  And unfortunately, if your whole house had been a Barbie house,
[10888.04s -> 10889.74s]  it probably would have been a lot higher.
[10889.74s -> 10891.42s]  I just I'm just going to be completely honest with you.
[10891.42s -> 10895.66s]  Although the philosophy of you making individual rooms
[10895.66s -> 10898.78s]  and individual spaces that were completely disconnected
[10898.78s -> 10901.12s]  from each other did have to take you some time.
[10901.12s -> 10902.72s]  And you stuck with that philosophy.
[10902.72s -> 10905.88s]  So I'm going to you got an 87 for philosophy.
[10905.88s -> 10906.20s]  Wow.
[10906.20s -> 10907.08s]  Thank you.
[10907.08s -> 10911.00s]  You got 76 for complexity and 61 for cleanliness.
[10911.08s -> 10915.24s]  Chat has given you they're still deciding,
[10915.24s -> 10916.92s]  but it looks like they're going to give you a C.
[10916.92s -> 10919.28s]  Oh, all right.
[10919.28s -> 10921.10s]  Well, question.
[10921.10s -> 10922.86s]  Where is the rest of the upstairs?
[10922.86s -> 10924.86s]  Oh, wait, wait.
[10924.86s -> 10925.10s]  Yeah.
[10925.10s -> 10927.53s]  Where is the rest of the upstairs?
[10927.53s -> 10936.12s]  So rather than leaving a empty room that kind of felt unfinished,
[10936.12s -> 10941.60s]  I opted for let's just kind of box it in.
[10942.24s -> 10943.52s]  What does the outside look like?
[10943.52s -> 10946.24s]  Can you go out to the outside and look at the exterior?
[10951.64s -> 10954.24s]  Chat, you got 75 from chat.
[10954.24s -> 10955.28s]  Your total grade.
[10958.38s -> 10961.28s]  Actually, all right.
[10963.32s -> 10964.68s]  You got a 78.4.
[10964.68s -> 10966.35s]  That's a C plus.
[10966.35s -> 10968.03s]  Hey, almost a B.
[10968.97s -> 10969.45s]  All right.
[10969.45s -> 10970.09s]  I'll take it.
[10970.65s -> 10977.07s]  I will say you hit the nail on the head with the Oppenheimer Barbie house
[10978.91s -> 10981.87s]  kind of being abandoned halfway through for the multiple room thing.
[10981.87s -> 10982.91s]  That's exactly what happened.
[10982.91s -> 10983.55s]  That's what I figured.
[10984.03s -> 10986.91s]  I started with that vision and I thought, oh, this is going to be great.
[10986.91s -> 10990.43s]  And then kind of got carried away, I believe, with each of these rooms.
[10990.43s -> 10992.75s]  So, you know, you hit the nail on the head there.
[10992.75s -> 10994.43s]  And I think if I could go back, I would have just done.
[10994.43s -> 10996.27s]  Hey, honestly, your first thing.
[10996.27s -> 10998.83s]  Philosophy, you beat at an 87 for philosophy.
[10999.87s -> 11000.75s]  You were on the right track.
[11000.75s -> 11003.15s]  It's just timing and first time playing it.
[11003.15s -> 11004.27s]  I completely get it.
[11004.27s -> 11005.07s]  That's a good job.
[11005.07s -> 11006.75s]  It was very wonderful presentation.
[11006.75s -> 11007.87s]  Very wonderful house.
[11007.87s -> 11010.49s]  Everybody should be clapping right now, please.
[11010.49s -> 11012.16s]  Thank you, Kraikin.
[11012.16s -> 11012.96s]  Thank you.
[11012.96s -> 11014.83s]  Yeah, this has been a pleasure.
[11014.83s -> 11016.59s]  Anybody have anything to say about Kraikin's
[11017.55s -> 11022.68s]  a themed house that became unthemed after 20 minutes?
[11022.68s -> 11023.48s]  Yeah, I got a lot to say.
[11024.67s -> 11026.28s]  A lot to say.
[11026.28s -> 11027.16s]  You got a lot to say.
[11027.96s -> 11031.39s]  First of all, fantastic job on the Maze and Corporation.
[11031.39s -> 11032.19s]  Thank you.
[11032.19s -> 11032.35s]  Really.
[11032.35s -> 11032.99s]  Thank you, founder.
[11036.14s -> 11040.94s]  Why, when you knocked down the wall, Jerma said, whoa, at an empty room.
[11040.94s -> 11042.22s]  I just, what the fuck was that?
[11043.36s -> 11045.28s]  We just said, whoa, at an empty room.
[11045.92s -> 11047.20s]  What was that?
[11047.20s -> 11050.08s]  Well, I, because I didn't know the empty room.
[11050.08s -> 11053.04s]  It was very strange that he was able to hide this from me so well.
[11053.68s -> 11057.36s]  Actually, it's kind of strange that he built a wall.
[11057.36s -> 11058.56s]  Oh, we got maze drama.
[11058.56s -> 11059.36s]  He hid it from me.
[11059.36s -> 11060.08s]  He hid it from me.
[11060.08s -> 11061.12s]  All the mazes.
[11061.12s -> 11062.80s]  You two both made mazes.
[11062.80s -> 11064.16s]  You guys both made mazes.
[11065.36s -> 11066.64s]  Look, it was not empty.
[11066.64s -> 11070.24s]  There actually was another toilet paper behind the wall in case you lose the first one.
[11070.24s -> 11070.80s]  There's a second one.
[11070.80s -> 11072.16s]  I just saw it in my comments.
[11072.16s -> 11073.12s]  I apologize then.
[11073.12s -> 11074.48s]  Additional toilet paper.
[11074.48s -> 11076.44s]  Yeah, there's an Easter egg.
[11077.71s -> 11079.39s]  Your outside is very dirty.
[11079.39s -> 11080.91s]  Your outside is very dirty.
[11082.03s -> 11085.47s]  Out of everybody, I know it's part of the theme, but you have the worst outside, I would say.
[11085.47s -> 11088.11s]  And I mean that in the nicest way possible.
[11088.11s -> 11088.99s]  Open the garage, please.
[11089.55s -> 11090.83s]  There's no nice way to say that.
[11090.83s -> 11092.59s]  I did clean this side, though.
[11092.59s -> 11094.60s]  Look, Vinny, okay?
[11094.60s -> 11097.82s]  Oh shit, you did clean that side.
[11097.82s -> 11100.86s]  I don't know why I cleaned that corner, but I did.
[11100.86s -> 11101.90s]  What's in the garage?
[11101.90s -> 11104.30s]  It was a very enticing corner to clean, I agree.
[11104.30s -> 11106.06s]  I will, Joel.
[11106.70s -> 11110.86s]  Joel is the only one really that actually utilized the garage.
[11110.86s -> 11111.50s]  That's true.
[11111.50s -> 11112.86s]  This is true.
[11112.86s -> 11118.14s]  Joel is sitting at an 87 right now.
[11118.14s -> 11119.50s]  All right, are we ready to move on?
[11121.50s -> 11122.86s]  Now it's either Polk or Ludwig.
[11122.86s -> 11123.42s]  I think it's...
[11123.42s -> 11125.90s]  Who do we got?
[11125.90s -> 11126.70s]  I'm ready.
[11126.70s -> 11128.06s]  Polk is ready to go right now.
[11128.06s -> 11132.09s]  And Ludwig will be right after Polk.
[11132.09s -> 11132.81s]  Polk, how are you?
[11133.80s -> 11134.12s]  Great.
[11135.87s -> 11136.59s]  How are you?
[11136.59s -> 11137.55s]  I'm doing fantastic.
[11137.55s -> 11138.75s]  I'm so glad you're actually here.
[11139.55s -> 11141.63s]  I'm so looking forward to your house.
[11141.63s -> 11144.27s]  I'm really happy you actually got to be here for this.
[11145.23s -> 11148.14s]  No, I really thought it was tomorrow.
[11148.14s -> 11149.34s]  But no, this is great.
[11149.34s -> 11151.26s]  Dates, times, it's hard.
[11151.26s -> 11153.10s]  It's easy to get it all messed up, right?
[11155.07s -> 11155.87s]  I checked the time.
[11155.87s -> 11156.91s]  I didn't go over.
[11156.91s -> 11158.83s]  I think I didn't cheat, so we're good.
[11159.95s -> 11161.79s]  We gave you time anyways, because make it fair.
[11161.79s -> 11162.67s]  Yeah, I cheated a little bit.
[11164.30s -> 11166.62s]  Well, Italic flipped his whole house upside down, so it's okay.
[11167.96s -> 11169.00s]  Let's open up your stream.
[11170.12s -> 11172.12s]  Can you just move it around for a little bit so I can see?
[11172.12s -> 11177.93s]  It's a little bit ready to turn around.
[11177.93s -> 11181.64s]  I think it's okay.
[11181.64s -> 11182.36s]  I think it's all right.
[11182.36s -> 11183.16s]  It should be good.
[11183.16s -> 11184.28s]  Let's just double check it.
[11184.28s -> 11185.08s]  How do you guys feel?
[11185.08s -> 11186.52s]  Can you give us a full circle?
[11190.46s -> 11190.94s]  Yeah, we're good.
[11190.94s -> 11191.42s]  Looks good.
[11192.38s -> 11195.47s]  All right, Poke, take it away.
[11195.47s -> 11197.39s]  What do you got?
[11197.39s -> 11199.69s]  Hi, and welcome to my house.
[11199.69s -> 11205.82s]  I opened my door.
[11205.82s -> 11207.42s]  This is my beautiful house I worked on.
[11210.54s -> 11211.90s]  This is my first time playing, too.
[11213.34s -> 11214.62s]  I had no past experience.
[11215.34s -> 11217.50s]  On the way here, I woke up my roommate.
[11217.50s -> 11221.52s]  He won on my PC, did everything for me, the tutorial, everything.
[11221.52s -> 11225.16s]  And I just took over, and here's what I got.
[11229.53s -> 11231.05s]  Let's take a look at the outside.
[11231.05s -> 11234.01s]  The outside is a little dirty, Poke.
[11234.01s -> 11235.77s]  It's a little dirty on the outside.
[11235.77s -> 11238.09s]  I didn't really have time to clean the outside.
[11240.57s -> 11243.05s]  It's not about what is out anyways.
[11243.05s -> 11245.10s]  It's about what is inside.
[11245.10s -> 11245.98s]  I think that matters.
[11247.34s -> 11248.38s]  Can we start with the garage?
[11250.22s -> 11251.18s]  Do we have to?
[11251.18s -> 11253.10s]  Kind of, because I want to see if there's anything in it.
[11253.10s -> 11262.16s]  Do you hear the sound, by the way?
[11262.96s -> 11264.64s]  I hear the sound, yeah.
[11265.84s -> 11268.08s]  All right, so cars can fit in here.
[11269.80s -> 11270.92s]  I mean, it's good.
[11270.92s -> 11271.40s]  It's clean.
[11271.40s -> 11274.19s]  You can fit cars if you really wanted to, you know?
[11276.60s -> 11283.44s]  So I went for like a lime green design, you know?
[11284.08s -> 11288.96s]  And if people look at, I mean, since the house isn't really done fully, you know,
[11289.84s -> 11291.68s]  what's wrong with having a few placeholders, you know?
[11293.53s -> 11294.41s]  Are these other houses?
[11294.41s -> 11296.57s]  Is this what the house could look like eventually?
[11296.57s -> 11297.85s]  Is what's on the exterior?
[11297.85s -> 11300.25s]  I don't know.
[11300.25s -> 11303.04s]  I mean, those houses look great.
[11303.04s -> 11306.56s]  Whatever houses these are, they look phenomenal.
[11306.56s -> 11310.57s]  I mean, it just messes with your imagination a little bit.
[11310.57s -> 11311.85s]  It's like an optical illusion.
[11313.05s -> 11315.45s]  So here's, let's just go in the front.
[11315.45s -> 11316.97s]  This is the front of the house right here.
[11316.97s -> 11318.09s]  Wait, this is the front door?
[11319.26s -> 11319.76s]  Yep.
[11321.04s -> 11322.96s]  You know, let's put some music on.
[11328.17s -> 11335.56s]  So I went with like a, I went with like a, like a airport, you know what I'm saying?
[11335.56s -> 11337.56s]  All right, so you made an airport in, okay.
[11337.56s -> 11338.92s]  Give me the philosophy on that.
[11338.92s -> 11342.52s]  I mean, when you're rich, you can really do anything you really want.
[11342.52s -> 11347.72s]  And this is for the people out there who just want to get what they want, you know?
[11347.72s -> 11350.22s]  And some people want a Willy Wonka house.
[11350.22s -> 11352.43s]  Some people want a fact, you know?
[11352.43s -> 11354.89s]  Some people really just want an airport.
[11355.53s -> 11356.57s]  I would want an airport.
[11356.57s -> 11358.01s]  Oh, can you elbow the city player?
[11358.01s -> 11359.85s]  I think there's something wrong with it.
[11359.85s -> 11366.04s]  I think it's skipping a little, okay?
[11366.04s -> 11370.33s]  Now, this is, we're all streamers here.
[11370.33s -> 11372.06s]  We're all streamers here.
[11372.14s -> 11378.78s]  And I made sure to make one of the houses really relatable to all of them.
[11378.78s -> 11380.22s]  This is the streamer room.
[11381.34s -> 11383.66s]  Now, I didn't have any photos on my PC.
[11383.66s -> 11385.42s]  I only had sponsor photos.
[11385.42s -> 11390.43s]  So these are just, these are the different sponsors you've had throughout the last year?
[11394.43s -> 11397.55s]  You have one of those banned lawn chairs.
[11397.55s -> 11402.88s]  The most uncomfortable, those things make sweaty red fucking marks all over your whole body.
[11402.88s -> 11405.77s]  I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to take some points off of that.
[11405.77s -> 11406.27s]  Really?
[11407.05s -> 11409.21s]  They make sweaty red bands across your whole body.
[11409.21s -> 11409.93s]  It's horrible.
[11409.93s -> 11414.22s]  But I'm gonna have to give you some points with complexity though.
[11414.22s -> 11418.11s]  Your score is very high right now.
[11418.11s -> 11422.11s]  There's a triple PC set, people have dual PC setups.
[11422.11s -> 11423.79s]  And here, this house, we have the triple PC.
[11425.34s -> 11427.90s]  These are all three individual computers?
[11427.90s -> 11428.54s]  Yes.
[11428.54s -> 11430.08s]  Okay, interesting.
[11432.48s -> 11435.84s]  Can you pump through like multiple games or are you trying to do multiple streams?
[11436.40s -> 11438.56s]  It's to stream the streaming PC.
[11438.56s -> 11439.36s]  Okay, what do we got on the wall?
[11439.36s -> 11440.89s]  So these are TVs?
[11440.89s -> 11443.04s]  These are all just TVs.
[11443.04s -> 11445.32s]  Ah, cool.
[11445.32s -> 11446.28s]  Now, here's the kitchen.
[11452.99s -> 11454.75s]  Raj's doors.
[11454.75s -> 11456.60s]  Or your doors.
[11456.60s -> 11462.51s]  Yeah, I mean, we all learn from Russ, you know, how to really protect yourself.
[11463.23s -> 11468.83s]  And why would you not want to like, like, you know?
[11468.83s -> 11474.80s]  Yeah, I thought I did, what did you, where'd you get the flashlight from?
[11474.80s -> 11477.28s]  It's music.
[11477.92s -> 11480.70s]  All right, wait, wait, turn, turn back around.
[11481.34s -> 11485.52s]  I, what, this is just a picture of, who's that a picture of?
[11487.13s -> 11490.17s]  Just some inspiration to get like, just get back to work.
[11490.17s -> 11490.41s]  Got it.
[11490.41s -> 11491.05s]  You know what I mean?
[11491.77s -> 11494.36s]  I do like the wallpaper in here.
[11494.36s -> 11496.04s]  It's, it's very creative.
[11496.04s -> 11496.36s]  Thank you.
[11496.36s -> 11500.00s]  Thank you.
[11500.00s -> 11502.72s]  So, can I see, what's the painting on the wall here?
[11502.72s -> 11504.08s]  On the, this, this side wall?
[11504.08s -> 11505.04s]  If you turn to the left.
[11505.04s -> 11505.84s]  It's a window.
[11505.84s -> 11506.64s]  Oh, that's a window.
[11506.64s -> 11507.84s]  Oh, that'd be beautiful yard.
[11508.40s -> 11509.68s]  Every house needs air.
[11509.68s -> 11511.84s]  Well, turn around, let me see the beautiful yard again.
[11511.84s -> 11512.88s]  Turn around, look at the yard.
[11512.88s -> 11517.88s]  Yeah, to the right, where, where that is.
[11517.88s -> 11520.68s]  Yeah, that looks, that's exactly what that looks like on the wall.
[11520.68s -> 11522.99s]  Now go back, go back inside and take a look out.
[11522.99s -> 11523.55s]  I just want to.
[11524.88s -> 11526.00s]  Oh, I mean.
[11526.00s -> 11526.64s]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[11526.64s -> 11527.36s]  Oh, you mean like here?
[11527.36s -> 11528.48s]  Yeah, it does, it does.
[11528.48s -> 11529.68s]  Yeah, that's what it looks like.
[11529.68s -> 11532.32s]  It's transparent.
[11533.76s -> 11536.72s]  It's weird that the lake is like kind of an optical illusion,
[11536.72s -> 11538.00s]  kind of like a mirage sometimes.
[11538.00s -> 11538.80s]  That's weird.
[11538.80s -> 11541.28s]  It looks good though.
[11541.28s -> 11542.08s]  Let's go upstairs.
[11542.08s -> 11552.38s]  Yeah, let's take a look upstairs.
[11552.38s -> 11553.82s]  What the fuck is that?
[11555.56s -> 11556.76s]  We don't want to go down there.
[11556.76s -> 11561.39s]  What is going on down there?
[11561.39s -> 11561.79s]  All right.
[11561.79s -> 11565.87s]  This is the realtors, one of the realtors son.
[11565.87s -> 11567.15s]  Oh, okay.
[11567.15s -> 11568.56s]  I like it.
[11568.56s -> 11570.01s]  I like it.
[11570.01s -> 11570.65s]  I do appreciate it.
[11570.65s -> 11574.65s]  So the floor, Vinnie and Kraken had this on their walls.
[11574.65s -> 11576.97s]  So it's really nice that you actually made them rugs on the ground.
[11577.77s -> 11578.01s]  Yeah.
[11578.01s -> 11580.17s]  I think that's a pretty good philosophical reason to do that.
[11581.16s -> 11581.88s]  Thank you.
[11581.88s -> 11583.95s]  I couldn't find any lights.
[11585.42s -> 11585.98s]  Wait, that's a.
[11587.98s -> 11590.09s]  That's what came up when I searched for lights.
[11590.09s -> 11592.62s]  If you're wondering, these don't turn on either.
[11593.34s -> 11599.08s]  Do you?
[11599.08s -> 11599.88s]  Okay, poke.
[11599.88s -> 11600.84s]  Very important question.
[11601.96s -> 11603.48s]  Do you have a bathroom?
[11604.73s -> 11606.65s]  Yes, I'll get there right now.
[11606.65s -> 11612.92s]  Some music.
[11612.92s -> 11619.26s]  So here's the bathroom.
[11619.26s -> 11628.83s]  Oh, like behind you or this is the bathroom here.
[11628.83s -> 11630.51s]  Where do you go to the bathroom?
[11630.51s -> 11631.87s]  If I have to piss, where do I go?
[11633.48s -> 11640.78s]  Um, I fucking can't.
[11640.78s -> 11641.18s]  All right.
[11641.98s -> 11645.77s]  So what is there?
[11645.77s -> 11646.97s]  Is that a security camera?
[11648.38s -> 11654.04s]  Well, you want to have safety and that's the actual design of the room.
[11655.56s -> 11660.24s]  Is going that way.
[11660.24s -> 11660.80s]  What's in that room?
[11660.80s -> 11661.36s]  What's in that room?
[11663.74s -> 11664.24s]  Yeah.
[11665.76s -> 11670.72s]  All right, you're gonna have to get an extra few points for that.
[11671.36s -> 11672.48s]  You have to get a few points for that.
[11672.48s -> 11673.76s]  You actually tricked me.
[11673.76s -> 11674.64s]  Okay, you get a few.
[11674.64s -> 11675.76s]  You get a few more points for that.
[11676.88s -> 11681.63s]  Uh, I'm going to bring complexity down a little because there's no room there,
[11681.63s -> 11682.83s]  but I brought your creativity up.
[11684.56s -> 11684.96s]  All right.
[11684.96s -> 11685.20s]  What?
[11685.20s -> 11685.60s]  What is it?
[11685.60s -> 11686.40s]  What's the say on the wall?
[11688.20s -> 11690.04s]  Room room.
[11690.04s -> 11694.73s]  Okay, so you've got and what's that?
[11694.73s -> 11697.45s]  Is that a photo of Ninja?
[11697.45s -> 11698.89s]  I don't have nothing on this PC.
[11698.89s -> 11701.05s]  So Connor did also by sort of.
[11701.05s -> 11704.33s]  I can't talk.
[11704.33s -> 11705.69s]  I can't even hear myself.
[11706.57s -> 11707.61s]  Connor did a similar.
[11709.05s -> 11711.13s]  If you stand that way and then open it, it won't hit you.
[11712.25s -> 11712.89s]  If you go.
[11712.89s -> 11713.29s]  All right.
[11713.93s -> 11716.81s]  Yeah, go just turn all the turn off the.
[11716.81s -> 11718.01s]  Yeah, because then we can talk.
[11718.65s -> 11723.02s]  Is that question mark to signify the Riddler?
[11723.58s -> 11734.17s]  Well, that's just to really, you know, I don't think the image loaded.
[11734.73s -> 11738.59s]  That would make sense.
[11738.59s -> 11739.47s]  It's probably an area.
[11741.47s -> 11742.91s]  What was supposed to be there?
[11742.91s -> 11743.39s]  What'd you say?
[11745.23s -> 11747.31s]  Honestly, one of the other photos, probably Ninja.
[11748.11s -> 11748.51s]  Okay.
[11748.51s -> 11748.91s]  All right.
[11748.91s -> 11749.95s]  Light the question mark.
[11751.39s -> 11752.35s]  It looks good itself.
[11752.35s -> 11753.47s]  Obviously, brutally honest.
[11754.19s -> 11755.23s]  I mean, I think it looks great.
[11755.79s -> 11756.91s]  No, what is the solar?
[11757.55s -> 11758.76s]  Oh, that's the solar.
[11758.76s -> 11759.40s]  Okay.
[11759.40s -> 11760.60s]  I thought it was a cell tower.
[11761.90s -> 11768.70s]  And honestly, this, this is for like the rich who just want to throw off burglars and stuff.
[11769.50s -> 11773.90s]  Imagine you came in and where would, you know, you'd have no idea how to get there.
[11774.70s -> 11777.90s]  It would throw me off because it did throw me off because I actually did not know if
[11777.90s -> 11778.78s]  it was a real room or not.
[11778.78s -> 11779.42s]  So you got me.
[11781.56s -> 11781.80s]  All right.
[11781.80s -> 11783.32s]  Is there anything else for us to see poker?
[11783.32s -> 11784.44s]  Is that, is that pretty much it?
[11785.40s -> 11789.32s]  Honestly, that's all I was able to figure out.
[11789.32s -> 11789.96s]  All right.
[11789.96s -> 11792.99s]  So I'll give you the grades, the grades that I have for you so far.
[11792.99s -> 11796.92s]  I really did like your airport philosophy.
[11796.92s -> 11801.08s]  The reason why your philosophy is so much higher is you have a 95 in philosophy
[11801.08s -> 11807.48s]  because I'm getting inside kind of your head a little bit here because you're you get back.
[11807.48s -> 11809.88s]  You're like, fuck, I'm 30, 40 minutes late.
[11809.88s -> 11810.84s]  I need to do something.
[11810.84s -> 11811.88s]  I'm going to do an airport.
[11811.88s -> 11812.68s]  And it's like, no, you know what?
[11812.68s -> 11813.32s]  Fuck it.
[11813.32s -> 11816.28s]  I'm going to change it from an airport to like an anti-burglar house.
[11816.28s -> 11816.92s]  And then you're like, fuck it.
[11816.92s -> 11819.13s]  I'm just going to put garage doors everywhere.
[11819.13s -> 11823.52s]  You, you were like up against the clock and you made it happen.
[11823.52s -> 11826.88s]  And the philosophy of you making that happen and adding these comedic elements
[11826.88s -> 11830.16s]  is what puts you at a 95 for philosophy.
[11830.16s -> 11838.96s]  Unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately.
[11844.57s -> 11847.39s]  Sorry, I was waiting for a sound effect.
[11847.39s -> 11847.95s]  Sorry.
[11847.95s -> 11852.91s]  Your, your, your cleanliness was pretty much zero.
[11853.55s -> 11854.67s]  It's very dirty outside.
[11855.71s -> 11857.39s]  It was filthy out there.
[11857.39s -> 11859.15s]  It looks like you took a little bit of less time.
[11859.15s -> 11861.23s]  And this trash, that's a trash bag right there.
[11861.23s -> 11862.03s]  Well, that's not a trash bag.
[11862.03s -> 11862.43s]  What is that?
[11864.03s -> 11866.03s]  Oh, I thought that I thought that was a trash bag.
[11866.03s -> 11868.35s]  OK, but anyways, that's it.
[11868.35s -> 11871.48s]  You got a, you got a 60 for cleanliness.
[11871.48s -> 11872.36s]  It was very dirty.
[11872.36s -> 11874.44s]  And I dirty enough where I can overlook it.
[11875.50s -> 11877.90s]  I would probably give you like a, maybe like a 65
[11878.89s -> 11888.24s]  because of if you just go outside and just take a look around.
[11888.24s -> 11892.00s]  This paint cans, this wood, the flamethrower ran out.
[11892.00s -> 11892.56s]  Yeah.
[11892.56s -> 11894.40s]  And like the scaffolding is still there.
[11896.56s -> 11896.96s]  Basement.
[11896.96s -> 11898.64s]  Everyone's saying go to the basement, go to the basement.
[11898.64s -> 11899.60s]  Can you show us the basement?
[11903.56s -> 11904.92s]  Chad, let's get a grade.
[11908.96s -> 11910.64s]  Chad is currently giving you an A.
[11910.64s -> 11912.44s]  So we're going to the basement.
[11914.06s -> 11915.98s]  Oh, optical right now.
[11915.98s -> 11916.54s]  Oh, OK.
[11916.54s -> 11917.66s]  Optical illusion is pretty sick.
[11918.86s -> 11919.18s]  Yeah.
[11919.18s -> 11920.46s]  I, yeah, I think you nailed it.
[11920.46s -> 11921.50s]  I think you knocked it out of the park.
[11922.38s -> 11923.74s]  It just was very dirty.
[11923.74s -> 11925.82s]  So that's going to hurt your grade a lot.
[11925.82s -> 11928.38s]  But Chad has given you an A, which is a 95.
[11928.38s -> 11929.36s]  Yes.
[11929.36s -> 11932.62s]  So we here's where you stand now.
[11932.62s -> 11934.30s]  You stand poke.
[11934.30s -> 11941.24s]  You had a creativity of 95 as an A complexity of an 83.
[11942.25s -> 11944.57s]  Now, the reason why I give the, I just,
[11944.89s -> 11946.41s]  the big paintings on the wall.
[11946.97s -> 11948.97s]  I mean, you said you even said it yourself.
[11948.97s -> 11951.45s]  You didn't even know what images you had on this computer.
[11951.45s -> 11954.25s]  So yes, that's I got to bring some points down for that.
[11954.25s -> 11956.33s]  So that's an 83 for complexity.
[11956.33s -> 11960.49s]  Plus having a garage door for every single door is it's,
[11960.49s -> 11962.41s]  you know, it took us a while, you know, to open them.
[11962.97s -> 11963.85s]  And then they're very loud.
[11964.49s -> 11967.26s]  But your philosophy was a 95.
[11967.26s -> 11968.86s]  Your cleanliness was a 65.
[11968.86s -> 11971.58s]  And Chad gave you a 95 with the grand total poke.
[11973.21s -> 11978.75s]  You're a grade in total with this music in the background.
[11979.71s -> 11983.28s]  You're probably going to be pretty close to being at the top.
[11983.28s -> 11985.20s]  If I'm honest.
[11985.20s -> 11985.70s]  Yes.
[11987.00s -> 11988.76s]  Oh, wow.
[11989.77s -> 11990.17s]  All right.
[11990.17s -> 11997.10s]  So you are at an overall grade of 87.5, which puts you, Joel had 87.6.
[11998.33s -> 11998.97s]  Oh, wow.
[11998.97s -> 12000.65s]  It was, it was the cleanliness is what killed you.
[12002.19s -> 12003.23s]  That's worth 15%.
[12003.23s -> 12005.88s]  No, I'll take that.
[12005.88s -> 12006.60s]  Damn.
[12006.60s -> 12011.21s]  80, 87, 87.5.
[12011.21s -> 12011.77s]  Nice job.
[12011.77s -> 12012.09s]  Thank you.
[12013.80s -> 12014.20s]  I loved it.
[12014.20s -> 12014.60s]  I loved it.
[12015.42s -> 12015.92s]  Yeah.
[12016.16s -> 12017.68s]  What did you do?
[12017.68s -> 12018.80s]  Is that as another sponsor?
[12019.44s -> 12021.28s]  I don't even, I don't remember this.
[12022.90s -> 12023.54s]  I think so.
[12023.54s -> 12023.70s]  Yeah.
[12023.70s -> 12024.18s]  It was actually.
[12027.79s -> 12028.19s]  All right.
[12029.79s -> 12031.39s]  What do we have to say about this one?
[12031.39s -> 12032.19s]  This is very good.
[12032.99s -> 12033.71s]  We have some thoughts.
[12033.71s -> 12035.07s]  I would not want to raid this house.
[12035.07s -> 12036.91s]  It would take way too much gunpowder.
[12036.91s -> 12037.55s]  Thank you guys.
[12038.43s -> 12040.27s]  I love the painted on doors.
[12040.27s -> 12041.47s]  It's so funny.
[12041.47s -> 12044.91s]  The garage having to wait for the garage doors every time.
[12044.91s -> 12045.87s]  Oh, my God.
[12045.87s -> 12046.59s]  It's torture.
[12047.07s -> 12049.79s]  Like the idea of like each of the,
[12050.43s -> 12054.83s]  the first two notes playing from each individual radio that is in every room.
[12054.83s -> 12055.47s]  Did you put that?
[12056.03s -> 12058.03s]  Did you put that in or is that just there?
[12058.03s -> 12060.99s]  Yeah, I, I, I looped up.
[12060.99s -> 12062.27s]  I just shortened the song.
[12062.27s -> 12064.03s]  Oh, you took that.
[12064.03s -> 12064.83s]  That's so funny.
[12065.87s -> 12066.75s]  Oh, my God.
[12067.71s -> 12069.95s]  If you were upstairs in that home and someone's at the door,
[12069.95s -> 12071.95s]  you probably wouldn't make it in time.
[12071.95s -> 12072.91s]  I don't think anyone is.
[12072.91s -> 12073.79s]  No one's by the way.
[12073.79s -> 12076.11s]  I love that you painted the whole outside of the house.
[12076.11s -> 12077.55s]  This experiment green.
[12078.35s -> 12079.55s]  This took half the time.
[12080.19s -> 12082.11s]  And it's, it's all splotchy.
[12082.11s -> 12083.71s]  Look how splotchy it is over there.
[12084.35s -> 12086.59s]  The inside of the house was the last 10 minutes.
[12088.19s -> 12089.87s]  I had no idea what I was doing.
[12089.87s -> 12090.51s]  That's so funny.
[12090.51s -> 12091.63s]  Can I give a point?
[12091.63s -> 12097.07s]  Can I like do a zero decimal one extra point friend point?
[12097.07s -> 12098.11s]  Because it's so good.
[12098.11s -> 12098.61s]  Okay.
[12099.23s -> 12102.78s]  Can I like, you know, give points?
[12102.78s -> 12105.98s]  Do you want, you want to, you want to step in and stamp on a point one point?
[12108.06s -> 12110.54s]  Because we're like, you know, we're like tight, right?
[12110.54s -> 12111.58s]  There's so much more.
[12111.58s -> 12113.26s]  I want to see everyone else's things first.
[12113.26s -> 12114.14s]  Let's, let's see everyone else's.
[12114.14s -> 12114.78s]  Okay.
[12114.78s -> 12115.18s]  Okay.
[12115.18s -> 12116.06s]  Let's see everyone else's.
[12116.06s -> 12117.34s]  I appreciate you though, man.
[12117.34s -> 12117.82s]  Damn.
[12117.82s -> 12118.22s]  Thank you.
[12120.56s -> 12121.84s]  Everyone else is doing great too.
[12121.84s -> 12123.20s]  I want to see, I want to see Ludwig's.
[12123.76s -> 12123.92s]  Yeah.
[12123.92s -> 12125.04s]  Lud's up next.
[12125.04s -> 12125.76s]  Lud is up next.
[12125.76s -> 12128.16s]  So we're going to thank you.
[12131.36s -> 12132.00s]  All right.
[12132.00s -> 12133.12s]  Oh, thanks a lot, dude.
[12133.12s -> 12133.68s]  It was awesome.
[12134.24s -> 12135.30s]  We'll see it.
[12135.30s -> 12136.34s]  We'll see how it plays out.
[12137.41s -> 12137.73s]  All right.
[12137.73s -> 12138.85s]  Ludwig, are you, are you ready?
[12140.53s -> 12141.03s]  Yep.
[12141.33s -> 12149.49s]  So Ludwig, I do have to tell you very importantly, there is, you did get a minus two deduction
[12149.49s -> 12151.01s]  to philosophy right off the bat.
[12153.25s -> 12154.21s]  I'm sorry.
[12154.21s -> 12157.65s]  Because we, we had a thing with the, when I unmuted everybody,
[12158.29s -> 12162.29s]  the first person to complain was the one that was going to get minus two points on their philosophy.
[12163.17s -> 12166.37s]  And I think the first thing you said was like, fuck this.
[12166.37s -> 12167.09s]  This was stupid.
[12168.42s -> 12169.94s]  No, I didn't say that.
[12169.94s -> 12171.06s]  I would never say that.
[12171.06s -> 12175.76s]  I forget what you said, but it was very funny.
[12178.26s -> 12183.22s]  But I am, I'm, I'm willing, I'm willing to scrub those points being deducted.
[12183.22s -> 12188.45s]  Look, it's fine because I think I'm going to score 100 in philosophy.
[12188.45s -> 12190.77s]  And so a 98 is still an A plus.
[12190.77s -> 12191.09s]  Really?
[12191.09s -> 12191.33s]  Okay.
[12191.33s -> 12192.21s]  You, you'll double it.
[12192.21s -> 12192.77s]  Give it to that person.
[12192.77s -> 12195.18s]  So you're really confident.
[12195.18s -> 12195.50s]  Yeah.
[12195.50s -> 12197.98s]  Because most of my build sucks.
[12197.98s -> 12200.38s]  I mean, I do not have the expertise of other people.
[12200.38s -> 12202.86s]  I do not have the, the cleanliness of other people.
[12202.86s -> 12203.26s]  Okay.
[12203.26s -> 12206.98s]  But philosophy is what this whole build is based off.
[12206.98s -> 12207.38s]  Okay.
[12207.38s -> 12210.91s]  And, and, uh, Jerma, I'm, I'm getting up there in years.
[12210.91s -> 12212.93s]  I turned 28 this week.
[12212.93s -> 12216.05s]  Um, yeah, happy birthday by the way, if everybody didn't know.
[12216.93s -> 12217.49s]  Thank you.
[12217.49s -> 12219.01s]  Uh, it's, it's, uh, it's stupid.
[12219.01s -> 12222.29s]  Uh, and if this was a low score, it'd make my whole year shattered.
[12222.29s -> 12226.98s]  But, uh, what I want you to focus on is history.
[12226.98s -> 12227.30s]  Okay.
[12229.18s -> 12229.50s]  History.
[12229.50s -> 12231.18s]  You know what they say about history.
[12231.18s -> 12232.38s]  You know what they say.
[12232.38s -> 12237.14s]  If you do not learn from history, it is doomed to repeat itself.
[12237.14s -> 12237.70s]  Got it.
[12237.70s -> 12238.58s]  You ever heard that?
[12238.58s -> 12239.54s]  I have, uh, many times.
[12239.54s -> 12239.86s]  Oh yeah.
[12240.99s -> 12242.43s]  That's me that said that.
[12242.43s -> 12248.75s]  And, and, uh, and so today we are going to do an homage.
[12248.75s -> 12249.65s]  Okay.
[12249.65s -> 12251.65s]  To H. H. Ohms.
[12251.65s -> 12254.40s]  Do you know who that is?
[12254.40s -> 12256.16s]  I don't.
[12256.16s -> 12257.76s]  Well, I'll, I'll show you.
[12257.76s -> 12258.24s]  I'll show you.
[12258.24s -> 12264.02s]  Cause, cause first and foremost, um, he's an American.
[12264.02s -> 12264.34s]  Okay.
[12264.34s -> 12265.60s]  You hear that music?
[12265.60s -> 12271.90s]  I cannot hear the music.
[12271.90s -> 12273.42s]  You don't hear like the national anthem playing?
[12273.42s -> 12275.98s]  I don't, I can put the national anthem on over here if you want me to.
[12275.98s -> 12276.82s]  No, you're fine.
[12276.82s -> 12277.22s]  You're fine.
[12277.22s -> 12277.54s]  Okay.
[12277.54s -> 12278.02s]  Okay.
[12278.02s -> 12285.46s]  Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light?
[12286.86s -> 12290.14s]  This is our American garage.
[12290.14s -> 12290.54s]  Okay.
[12290.54s -> 12297.18s]  Uh, and, and it's where we are starting our story today to explain who H. H. Ohms is
[12297.18s -> 12302.06s]  because at the end of the day, this is a history lesson for you to learn to not repeat what was
[12302.06s -> 12303.02s]  done in the past.
[12303.02s -> 12304.22s]  Starting with the garage.
[12304.22s -> 12306.11s]  Already a good start.
[12306.11s -> 12306.51s]  Yep.
[12306.51s -> 12307.63s]  Starting with the garage here.
[12307.63s -> 12313.97s]  So H. H. Ohms, uh, was an American, uh, and I made this garage to dedicate, dedicate to him.
[12313.97s -> 12315.76s]  Um, oof.
[12315.76s -> 12316.64s]  Oh, you just blew it up.
[12317.52s -> 12319.86s]  No, it was a, it's an explosive entry.
[12319.86s -> 12322.90s]  It's like, oh, okay.
[12322.90s -> 12323.70s]  Okay.
[12323.70s -> 12324.18s]  Yeah.
[12324.18s -> 12329.63s]  Let me actually do a little bit of, you didn't have sound turned on.
[12330.19s -> 12330.59s]  All right.
[12330.59s -> 12330.83s]  Okay.
[12331.79s -> 12333.55s]  I realized now that I didn't.
[12333.55s -> 12334.53s]  I okay.
[12334.53s -> 12335.65s]  I still don't have sound on.
[12335.65s -> 12336.05s]  Okay.
[12336.05s -> 12338.05s]  I volume down.
[12338.05s -> 12338.29s]  Yep.
[12338.29s -> 12338.53s]  Thanks.
[12338.53s -> 12339.09s]  Thanks, Connor.
[12339.09s -> 12339.57s]  Thanks, Connor.
[12339.57s -> 12340.61s]  Stop talking to me ever again.
[12340.61s -> 12341.09s]  Thanks.
[12341.09s -> 12341.65s]  Sorry.
[12341.65s -> 12342.37s]  That was Connor.
[12342.37s -> 12345.63s]  Um, uh, can you even still hear it though?
[12345.63s -> 12346.91s]  I think it's sharing to my screen.
[12346.91s -> 12347.23s]  Hold up.
[12347.23s -> 12347.79s]  I'm resharing.
[12347.79s -> 12348.43s]  I'm resharing.
[12348.43s -> 12348.91s]  Reshare?
[12348.91s -> 12350.98s]  I'm stopping streaming restarting.
[12350.98s -> 12351.54s]  Okay.
[12351.54s -> 12353.66s]  Restarting share.
[12353.66s -> 12354.78s]  If you pull the actual game.
[12354.78s -> 12355.34s]  I'm back.
[12355.34s -> 12356.22s]  There you are back.
[12356.22s -> 12357.25s]  There we go.
[12357.25s -> 12357.65s]  We got it.
[12357.65s -> 12358.05s]  We got it.
[12358.05s -> 12358.77s]  Can hear the birds.
[12358.77s -> 12359.57s]  Yeah, there we are.
[12359.57s -> 12360.53s]  There we are.
[12360.53s -> 12362.45s]  This is our American garage.
[12362.45s -> 12365.25s]  Red, white and blue filled with the American flag.
[12365.25s -> 12371.17s]  Of course, uh, we have our, our turrets, um, which is going to come in handy a little bit later when
[12371.17s -> 12374.13s]  we, when we learn more about H.H. Holmes, who again, you don't know about, right?
[12375.25s -> 12376.61s]  That is a brand new person.
[12376.61s -> 12378.10s]  I don't even know who that is.
[12378.10s -> 12378.42s]  Great.
[12378.42s -> 12379.06s]  Brand new person.
[12379.06s -> 12379.46s]  Love that.
[12379.46s -> 12379.86s]  Love that.
[12379.86s -> 12383.49s]  So let's, let's talk more about it as we enter the backyard and you can see here.
[12383.49s -> 12385.01s]  Look at the walls, right?
[12385.01s -> 12385.89s]  Paint it all the way through.
[12385.89s -> 12386.85s]  Looks really nice.
[12386.85s -> 12387.25s]  Yeah.
[12387.25s -> 12390.08s]  Um, uh, do not enter.
[12390.08s -> 12391.44s]  Ooh, okay.
[12391.44s -> 12392.56s]  No, no doors.
[12392.56s -> 12394.51s]  No doors on the back.
[12394.51s -> 12398.91s]  It's nope because the house was a confusing design because H.H. Holmes.
[12398.91s -> 12404.67s]  Jeremo, this is where I should, uh, tell you he was America's first serial killer.
[12404.67s -> 12406.99s]  Oh, okay.
[12407.63s -> 12408.27s]  Okay.
[12408.27s -> 12409.58s]  Yep.
[12409.58s -> 12414.22s]  He was America's first serial killer and he operated out of Chicago during the Chicago
[12414.22s -> 12415.44s]  world fair.
[12415.44s -> 12420.00s]  He, uh, fell into some affluence through his family and through killing the leader of a
[12420.00s -> 12425.44s]  pharmacy and taking over said pharmacy and through that was able to create the murder
[12425.44s -> 12428.34s]  castle.
[12428.34s -> 12428.98s]  I love it.
[12428.98s -> 12430.66s]  This feels like a book report, Ludwig.
[12432.29s -> 12434.03s]  I'm going to tell you histories.
[12434.03s -> 12434.91s]  It doesn't repeat itself.
[12434.91s -> 12435.47s]  Yeah, go on.
[12435.47s -> 12437.47s]  Uh, we're here.
[12437.47s -> 12441.95s]  So the murder, the murder castle and, uh, uh, much like this project was developed very
[12441.95s -> 12444.11s]  quickly by many different developers.
[12444.11s -> 12447.39s]  Uh, and for me to emulate that, I took suggestions from my chat.
[12447.39s -> 12447.71s]  Okay.
[12447.71s -> 12449.31s]  To, uh, to create this.
[12449.31s -> 12454.42s]  So, so you'll notice the, the long, uh, winding narrow halls.
[12455.22s -> 12459.84s]  It's like a G mod map that hasn't put head textures put on it.
[12459.84s -> 12461.04s]  Uh, white all the way through.
[12461.04s -> 12462.18s]  Very clean.
[12462.18s -> 12462.66s]  Mind you.
[12462.66s -> 12463.70s]  It's very clean.
[12463.70s -> 12466.96s]  I will say you're starting at a hundred paint everywhere.
[12466.96s -> 12469.98s]  No spots missed at all.
[12469.98s -> 12470.30s]  None.
[12470.30s -> 12470.54s]  Yeah.
[12471.87s -> 12472.67s]  None at all.
[12472.67s -> 12475.86s]  Um, it's a maze house though.
[12475.86s -> 12477.46s]  It's, it's, it's, it's not a maze.
[12477.46s -> 12479.86s]  So that's, and that's, and I knew you'd say that because there's been a lot of
[12479.86s -> 12480.42s]  maze houses.
[12480.42s -> 12482.05s]  They haven't there.
[12482.05s -> 12484.53s]  There have been there, but there've been at least two.
[12484.53s -> 12487.41s]  The terrifying thing about HH homes is he would,
[12487.41s -> 12488.37s]  we love mazes.
[12488.37s -> 12489.57s]  Well, no, this is not a maze Connor.
[12489.57s -> 12490.29s]  I'm not, I'm not like you.
[12490.29s -> 12491.01s]  That'd be crunch.
[12491.01s -> 12495.65s]  Uh, HH homes use several different contractors to make his house.
[12495.65s -> 12498.85s]  That way no individual except for him knew the layout of the home.
[12498.93s -> 12501.97s]  He would then use it as a hotel during the Chicago world fair that people would
[12501.97s -> 12502.77s]  stay at.
[12502.77s -> 12507.73s]  And from the second floor, he would have a trap door to bring people to the first
[12507.73s -> 12509.90s]  floor.
[12509.90s -> 12510.62s]  What is that?
[12511.02s -> 12511.26s]  Okay.
[12511.26s -> 12512.94s]  That's from my hero academia.
[12512.94s -> 12514.74s]  What does it have to do with?
[12514.74s -> 12515.70s]  Did you hear what I said, Jerma?
[12515.70s -> 12515.86s]  Yeah.
[12515.86s -> 12519.14s]  But what does that have to do with HH homes, my hero academia?
[12519.14s -> 12520.50s]  Well, don't worry about this.
[12520.50s -> 12526.22s]  This is just to show the explosiveness of the trap door, bro.
[12526.22s -> 12526.54s]  All right.
[12526.54s -> 12527.66s]  That's pretty cool.
[12527.66s -> 12529.26s]  That's actually pretty cool.
[12529.26s -> 12529.50s]  Okay.
[12529.50s -> 12533.01s]  I'm going to have to get, we were starting a little bit high here.
[12533.01s -> 12533.41s]  Yeah.
[12533.97s -> 12536.74s]  You use the environment to make something happen.
[12536.74s -> 12538.50s]  And I'm going to, you're actually pretty high.
[12538.50s -> 12541.70s]  I thought it was just, I thought it was just a white house at first.
[12541.70s -> 12541.94s]  Okay.
[12541.94s -> 12542.50s]  Do you got me?
[12542.50s -> 12544.10s]  That would be embarrassing.
[12544.10s -> 12545.06s]  You got me here.
[12545.06s -> 12545.86s]  I'm actually here now.
[12545.86s -> 12546.66s]  You got me now.
[12546.66s -> 12549.41s]  Well, let me get you the hook then.
[12549.41s -> 12551.81s]  Yep.
[12551.81s -> 12558.51s]  The way HH homes would kill all his victims was by having them go through a trap door
[12558.51s -> 12564.48s]  into the basement where there'd be eaten alive by rats.
[12564.48s -> 12565.28s]  Really?
[12565.28s -> 12566.24s]  That's terrifying.
[12566.24s -> 12566.56s]  Yeah.
[12566.56s -> 12567.44s]  That's horrifying.
[12567.44s -> 12568.64s]  Your cleanliness just went down.
[12568.64s -> 12569.20s]  Horrifying.
[12569.20s -> 12570.75s]  10 points.
[12570.75s -> 12572.96s]  Well, it's a trap door.
[12572.96s -> 12573.68s]  It's the rat room.
[12575.68s -> 12576.96s]  They're located within the rat room.
[12576.96s -> 12578.88s]  But there are rats in your house.
[12578.88s -> 12580.32s]  So we have to be fair.
[12580.32s -> 12582.56s]  But it's in the trap door rat room where you're supposed to kill people.
[12582.56s -> 12584.16s]  So it makes sense that the rats are here.
[12584.16s -> 12585.42s]  What's that on the-
[12585.42s -> 12586.22s]  Whatever.
[12586.22s -> 12587.02s]  What's on the wall there?
[12587.02s -> 12587.58s]  Can we find us?
[12588.99s -> 12591.90s]  This is, if looks could kill, you know what I mean?
[12595.81s -> 12596.45s]  Okay.
[12596.45s -> 12600.05s]  So this is where, this is where, so you could be, is that a poker table, blackjack table?
[12600.05s -> 12600.53s]  What's over there?
[12600.53s -> 12603.36s]  What's the philosophy for that being in here?
[12603.36s -> 12605.20s]  I figured the rats would get bored.
[12605.20s -> 12607.68s]  And I wanted to put a poker table for them to play poker at.
[12607.68s -> 12609.02s]  Okay.
[12609.02s -> 12609.34s]  All right.
[12612.06s -> 12616.66s]  Jerma, this is, this is, I hope, an eye-opening
[12619.41s -> 12625.41s]  about the dangers of the past and how not knowing them could make them happen in the future.
[12625.41s -> 12626.77s]  And what I want you to understand-
[12626.77s -> 12629.09s]  Are you gonna kill me?
[12630.05s -> 12630.77s]  What does that mean?
[12631.73s -> 12633.17s]  Are you gonna kill me?
[12633.17s -> 12633.89s]  I'm just teaching.
[12634.53s -> 12635.49s]  This is educational.
[12635.49s -> 12636.29s]  It's educational.
[12636.99s -> 12637.55s]  All right.
[12637.55s -> 12640.43s]  And I just, I want to teach you to just be wary in the future.
[12640.43s -> 12643.23s]  If you ever go to a hotel, make sure it's from a reputable source.
[12643.23s -> 12643.55s]  Okay.
[12643.55s -> 12648.61s]  Because you could end up in H.H. Holm's murder castle.
[12649.41s -> 12652.59s]  Oh, sh-
[12652.59s -> 12653.55s]  That's the end of the tour.
[12653.55s -> 12654.59s]  Oh, all right.
[12654.59s -> 12654.91s]  Shit.
[12654.91s -> 12656.08s]  Okay.
[12656.08s -> 12658.94s]  That's, that's the whole tour.
[12658.94s -> 12661.66s]  I spent most of the time painting everything white.
[12661.66s -> 12663.50s]  Everything was white.
[12663.50s -> 12664.54s]  We have a few questions.
[12664.54s -> 12665.82s]  Yep.
[12665.82s -> 12667.10s]  Yeah, please, please, go ahead.
[12667.10s -> 12669.02s]  Two, I have a few important questions.
[12669.02s -> 12669.66s]  Number one.
[12669.66s -> 12669.98s]  Uh-huh.
[12669.98s -> 12670.30s]  Yep.
[12670.30s -> 12672.50s]  Where's the bathroom?
[12672.50s -> 12673.78s]  Uh, that's a great question.
[12673.78s -> 12674.74s]  The bathroom?
[12674.74s -> 12680.86s]  Let me bring it to you right now.
[12680.86s -> 12681.82s]  Right here.
[12681.82s -> 12682.62s]  Okay, so you did-
[12682.62s -> 12684.69s]  Okay, so this is a bathroom.
[12684.69s -> 12685.25s]  This is-
[12685.25s -> 12686.45s]  This is the toilet bathroom.
[12686.45s -> 12687.09s]  Got it, got it.
[12687.09s -> 12688.69s]  Okay, I do appreciate the fact that it's outside.
[12688.69s -> 12689.33s]  Can you go ahead?
[12689.33s -> 12691.17s]  Just give me, give me the outdoor look again.
[12691.17s -> 12691.57s]  I want to-
[12691.57s -> 12693.57s]  No trash, no, no bullshit's here, right?
[12693.57s -> 12694.61s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[12694.61s -> 12696.85s]  No, no, no bullshit here at all.
[12696.85s -> 12699.17s]  You know, I cleaned up the entire yard.
[12700.74s -> 12701.78s]  Chopped down the trees in the front.
[12701.78s -> 12702.98s]  I thought they were a bit tacky.
[12702.98s -> 12703.70s]  Okay.
[12703.70s -> 12705.38s]  Some weeds grew back just because the game was open.
[12705.38s -> 12707.06s]  But, you know, they were, they were gone earlier.
[12708.56s -> 12709.36s]  I, I've-
[12709.36s -> 12710.64s]  So here's what I've got so far.
[12710.64s -> 12713.28s]  I like the fact that you did the garage.
[12713.28s -> 12714.48s]  A lot of people just didn't even-
[12714.48s -> 12716.64s]  You, there's only two or three people that even
[12716.64s -> 12718.00s]  stepped foot in the garage, it seems.
[12718.80s -> 12721.79s]  I do appreciate the fact that the garage is done.
[12721.79s -> 12723.63s]  So, Chad is going to be grading your house right now.
[12723.63s -> 12725.39s]  I'm going to give you my grades that I have so far.
[12725.39s -> 12726.67s]  And you can argue with me if you want.
[12726.67s -> 12727.55s]  We can go through it.
[12727.55s -> 12728.42s]  I have you create-
[12728.42s -> 12729.30s]  I wouldn't dare.
[12729.30s -> 12731.14s]  So creativity, I got you at an 85.
[12731.14s -> 12732.88s]  The fuck?
[12732.88s -> 12733.44s]  85.
[12733.44s -> 12736.11s]  Sorry, um, what, why?
[12736.11s -> 12736.43s]  85-
[12736.43s -> 12737.63s]  Why do you hate me?
[12737.63s -> 12741.42s]  I got you to creativity 85 for a couple of specific reasons.
[12741.42s -> 12741.90s]  One.
[12741.90s -> 12742.54s]  Okay.
[12742.54s -> 12744.22s]  I like the philosophy.
[12744.22s -> 12747.12s]  The philosophy is actually where you're going to get some points back here.
[12747.12s -> 12752.00s]  Because you, you took, you took a theme and you,
[12752.00s -> 12757.22s]  your whole house is a gigantic, I got a gigantic history lesson.
[12757.22s -> 12758.91s]  That's really interesting.
[12758.91s -> 12760.51s]  I gave you a 93.
[12760.51s -> 12763.36s]  I gave you a 93 for, for philosophy.
[12763.36s -> 12763.84s]  You also-
[12763.84s -> 12766.24s]  Okay, and that includes the minus two?
[12766.24s -> 12766.88s]  You have 91.
[12766.88s -> 12767.28s]  So it's a 95.
[12767.28s -> 12768.80s]  You have a 91 in philosophy.
[12768.80s -> 12769.28s]  Oh.
[12769.28s -> 12770.24s]  So I forgot to do that.
[12770.72s -> 12771.28s]  Just a moment.
[12771.28s -> 12772.88s]  I apologize on my turn.
[12774.40s -> 12776.88s]  I want to just point out that if you go to that basement, right?
[12776.88s -> 12778.16s]  That's like the garage, right?
[12778.16s -> 12779.52s]  And you flip it upside down.
[12779.52s -> 12782.24s]  Can you show them, can you show them what we have in the basement?
[12782.24s -> 12783.04s]  Oh, the garage, sorry.
[12783.04s -> 12784.32s]  Can you flip it upside down?
[12784.32s -> 12785.84s]  How do you, how do you flip it upside down?
[12785.84s -> 12786.64s]  Can you flip it upside down?
[12787.44s -> 12788.40s]  How do you, how do you do that?
[12788.40s -> 12789.68s]  Flip it, can you flip it?
[12789.68s -> 12790.48s]  How do you flip it?
[12790.48s -> 12793.52s]  Ludwig, Chad is giving you, Chad is giving you an F on your house.
[12793.52s -> 12794.96s]  How do you flip it, Connor?
[12794.96s -> 12796.03s]  Flip it.
[12796.03s -> 12797.71s]  Oh, you keep saying flip it.
[12797.71s -> 12800.19s]  Flip it, flip the, flip the house, flip the house, do it.
[12800.27s -> 12801.63s]  Is it like a command?
[12801.63s -> 12803.12s]  Am I doing it?
[12803.12s -> 12804.08s]  G, GV what?
[12807.10s -> 12809.82s]  Oh, you're flipping the house to see what it looks like upside down?
[12810.94s -> 12811.74s]  He's asking me to flip it.
[12811.74s -> 12812.46s]  I don't know how to flip it.
[12813.10s -> 12814.54s]  Only Italics knows how to do that.
[12814.54s -> 12815.98s]  He's the only one that knows how to do that.
[12815.98s -> 12817.02s]  Grav?
[12817.02s -> 12817.74s]  Okay, look.
[12817.74s -> 12819.10s]  All right, close, close the garage door.
[12819.10s -> 12819.82s]  Close it.
[12819.82s -> 12821.42s]  Okay, sure, sure, sure.
[12821.42s -> 12823.50s]  Yeah, how do you flip the house?
[12823.50s -> 12823.82s]  Grav.
[12825.02s -> 12825.74s]  All right.
[12825.74s -> 12826.38s]  How do you do that?
[12826.38s -> 12827.34s]  You have to be inside.
[12827.98s -> 12832.62s]  Okay, I'm inside the house and then I type in Grav.
[12832.62s -> 12833.42s]  Okay.
[12833.82s -> 12835.10s]  Ludd, you had a great intro.
[12835.10s -> 12835.74s]  You had your intro.
[12835.74s -> 12836.78s]  You were like informed.
[12836.78s -> 12837.34s]  You were ready.
[12837.34s -> 12838.70s]  You had your history.
[12839.50s -> 12840.62s]  You didn't rattle by Connor right now.
[12841.65s -> 12843.97s]  What I'm trying to say is this is not an American room.
[12843.97s -> 12845.65s]  This is a hidden French room,
[12845.65s -> 12848.37s]  which is everything that America doesn't stand for.
[12848.37s -> 12851.73s]  If you flip it upside down, it's just the French flag of a room.
[12851.73s -> 12853.01s]  There's no stars in the room.
[12853.01s -> 12853.73s]  There's no stripes.
[12853.73s -> 12854.37s]  Where's the stars?
[12854.37s -> 12855.09s]  It's a French room.
[12855.09s -> 12856.21s]  Where's the stars and stripes, Ludd?
[12856.21s -> 12858.13s]  It's red, white, and blue.
[12858.13s -> 12858.93s]  Where's the stars and stripes?
[12858.93s -> 12860.05s]  And look on the outside.
[12860.05s -> 12861.49s]  It's a hidden French room.
[12861.49s -> 12863.09s]  You, I can't stand.
[12863.09s -> 12864.29s]  Look at all the stars.
[12864.29s -> 12865.25s]  It's red, white, and blue.
[12865.25s -> 12866.85s]  I can't get rid of this thing now, Connor.
[12866.85s -> 12867.97s]  You've stressed me out.
[12867.97s -> 12868.86s]  I'm sorry.
[12868.86s -> 12869.74s]  I'll leave you to it now.
[12869.74s -> 12870.32s]  I don't know.
[12870.32s -> 12872.54s]  I don't even know how to get rid.
[12872.54s -> 12873.10s]  All right.
[12873.10s -> 12875.02s]  I got my final grades for you, Luddwig.
[12875.02s -> 12876.06s]  And don't worry.
[12876.06s -> 12877.78s]  I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[12877.78s -> 12878.26s]  Okay.
[12878.26s -> 12879.94s]  So philosophy, you get a 91.
[12879.94s -> 12880.66s]  That's an A.
[12880.66s -> 12881.46s]  That's an A minus.
[12881.46s -> 12883.38s]  And we had an awesome history lesson.
[12884.42s -> 12886.50s]  I really do enjoy the fact that you utilized the garage.
[12886.50s -> 12888.02s]  You didn't just go over there and into the house
[12888.02s -> 12890.10s]  and not do anything with all the pieces.
[12890.10s -> 12891.46s]  You used all the pieces.
[12891.46s -> 12892.90s]  Painting this took a long time.
[12892.90s -> 12894.42s]  That's why you also get pretty high score.
[12895.70s -> 12897.38s]  And I realized most people didn't paint shit
[12897.38s -> 12899.22s]  and then put funny objects inside.
[12899.22s -> 12899.70s]  Yeah.
[12899.70s -> 12902.43s]  So that was a lesson.
[12902.43s -> 12904.43s]  You're an 85 for creativity.
[12904.43s -> 12905.07s]  I want you to show you.
[12905.07s -> 12905.55s]  Look at this.
[12905.55s -> 12906.98s]  Over here is painted.
[12906.98s -> 12907.46s]  Look at that.
[12907.46s -> 12908.82s]  You know how hard it is to get there?
[12908.82s -> 12909.54s]  All right.
[12909.54s -> 12911.38s]  I'm going to give you a couple extra points for complexity.
[12913.38s -> 12915.66s]  I painted in every available corner.
[12915.66s -> 12915.90s]  Yeah.
[12915.90s -> 12919.74s]  Your cleanliness is only a 90 because there was rats.
[12919.74s -> 12923.50s]  And I know that's on theme and on brand and everything.
[12923.50s -> 12924.30s]  It's part of the story.
[12924.30s -> 12926.62s]  So I'll give you a 92 on cleanliness.
[12927.02s -> 12931.74s]  You got a 91 philosophy, 92 cleanliness, 80 complexity,
[12931.74s -> 12935.01s]  85 creativity, and chat's grade is a 60.
[12935.01s -> 12937.25s]  So is that the worst chat grade for anyone today?
[12937.25s -> 12939.17s]  That's the worst chat grade that can possibly go out.
[12939.17s -> 12940.85s]  And they must have it out for you for some reason.
[12940.85s -> 12942.62s]  I don't know why.
[12942.62s -> 12943.10s]  You know what?
[12943.10s -> 12944.38s]  I've deserved it from day dot.
[12944.38s -> 12945.66s]  And they saw through me.
[12945.66s -> 12949.44s]  So your final grade, Ludwig, it's probably going to be.
[12949.44s -> 12953.39s]  Let's find out.
[12953.39s -> 12956.93s]  If only the music played through, it probably could have helped.
[12956.93s -> 12958.13s]  But you did put music through.
[12958.13s -> 12959.41s]  I really thought I had.
[12959.41s -> 12960.85s]  The music would have really helped then.
[12961.17s -> 12963.26s]  It would have been huge.
[12963.26s -> 12963.50s]  All right.
[12963.50s -> 12965.98s]  I got you at 92 cleanliness.
[12965.98s -> 12969.49s]  I got you at a 91 philosophy.
[12970.05s -> 12971.38s]  60 is pretty solid.
[12971.38s -> 12975.49s]  I got 60, which puts you at a final score.
[12976.93s -> 12979.81s]  You are at an 83.2 for your final score.
[12979.81s -> 12981.81s]  That is a B, a nearly B minus.
[12981.81s -> 12984.26s]  How does that stack up?
[12984.26s -> 12985.38s]  You're kind of right in the middle.
[12985.38s -> 12987.62s]  I do appreciate the whole thing.
[12987.62s -> 12989.30s]  So here's the thing about theming.
[12989.30s -> 12992.10s]  So everyone else that had a theme, they didn't stick with it.
[12992.10s -> 12994.50s]  A lot of the theming was kind of all, you know, okay,
[12994.50s -> 12996.58s]  we're starting with this theme, but we're moving on to other themes.
[12996.58s -> 13003.46s]  Your entire theme was this H.H. Holmes serial killer house.
[13003.46s -> 13005.14s]  It was the entire thing.
[13005.14s -> 13006.26s]  It was a mistake, Jerma.
[13006.26s -> 13009.70s]  I should have just filled up 12 rooms with 12 different things
[13009.70s -> 13012.26s]  and threw the Green Goblin in and done a little funny voice.
[13013.86s -> 13015.54s]  I don't need to give you guys a history lesson.
[13015.54s -> 13016.42s]  It's your day off.
[13016.42s -> 13018.34s]  Yeah, you gave us a history lesson.
[13018.34s -> 13021.62s]  I'm glad you're learning you definitely would benefit from some funny voices.
[13021.62s -> 13023.54s]  I think he was rumored.
[13024.50s -> 13026.98s]  Two have killed between 20 and 200 people.
[13026.98s -> 13029.14s]  So I just have to give her through the rest of this report,
[13029.14s -> 13033.60s]  although nine were only ever found in here.
[13033.60s -> 13035.84s]  Oh, house flipper drama.
[13036.64s -> 13037.44s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[13037.44s -> 13038.08s]  I'm not talking shit.
[13038.08s -> 13039.12s]  I'm saying it's what I should have done.
[13039.12s -> 13040.56s]  I should have shambles.
[13040.56s -> 13044.48s]  I should have made a the fucking community's falling apart right now.
[13045.49s -> 13046.37s]  I'm not talking trash.
[13046.37s -> 13048.85s]  I should have made a poorly designed tacky house
[13048.85s -> 13051.17s]  filled with furniture that I downloaded offline.
[13051.17s -> 13052.69s]  You're making crash houses.
[13052.69s -> 13053.57s]  Oh, OK.
[13053.57s -> 13055.33s]  Well, it's it's an American house.
[13055.33s -> 13059.01s]  And it's very clean, right? This is a garage that you'd expect a French house
[13059.65s -> 13064.69s]  house red white blue and their star and I couldn't figure out how to get the stars on the ceiling couldn't figure out to get the
[13064.69s -> 13066.69s]  Stars on the ceiling, but here's the thing
[13067.33s -> 13068.77s]  you painted a
[13068.77s -> 13073.01s]  Connor the re Connor you too Connor you had points a lot of points in
[13073.65s -> 13076.85s]  them in cleanliness and in philosophy because
[13077.17s -> 13080.47s]  It's it actually is a huge pain in the ass to paint every single wall in this game
[13080.65s -> 13084.13s]  It's a huge pain in the ass. Even if the wall is completely one color
[13084.21s -> 13086.29s]  It's a huge pain in the ass to paint every single color
[13087.18s -> 13092.62s]  It's liberty blue. Okay, tell me that's not american liberty blue. Anyway, who made the statue? I don't want to
[13093.34s -> 13095.07s]  I don't oh
[13095.07s -> 13097.74s]  Well, I guess it's actually a good point
[13097.74s -> 13102.22s]  Uh, well, I don't want to take up too much of your time here jerma. I'm happy with my score. Uh jerma's chat
[13102.22s -> 13106.78s]  Sorry, I uh disappointed you but I I hope you learned a lesson. We learned we hey
[13107.50s -> 13116.03s]  I learned something today that I didn't know before that's all that matters actually actually true statement. Be safe out there
[13116.35s -> 13120.72s]  All right. See you at work. Did you learn that five to seven minutes is a lot longer than you thought it was
[13121.68s -> 13126.24s]  Uh, how long was that because it to me felt like an eternity. I usually go about one to two minutes
[13126.24s -> 13135.23s]  But who's who's next? Uh, we got coming up next is I believe it is dug. Dug. Dug is next, right? Yes
[13135.95s -> 13138.11s]  We've got only there's only two people left

[13256.10s -> 13259.87s]  And chat this might be a bit scary. We're gonna head into haunted mansion next
[13259.95s -> 13263.95s]  Oh, you're gonna notice that haunted mansion is actually yes, seadog
[13264.43s -> 13267.23s]  A maze and as we go in oh god, sorry. Sorry

[13278.43s -> 13281.95s]  Really really gets you into the mood not even for children because of how scary this is
[13282.59s -> 13285.55s]  I genuinely don't remember where the ending is
[13286.11s -> 13290.35s]  Uh, it's an actual maze walking through. Oh, can I start to wonder can I pause you for one second?
[13290.99s -> 13293.39s]  Let me pause you for one second. You made an actual maze
[13294.38s -> 13300.56s]  Connor your maze was just like a curly queue with with pictures from your computer. It was very good
[13300.88s -> 13302.88s]  But this is a this is this
[13303.12s -> 13308.88s]  What is it slander? No, no, i'm just saying this is like the first real maze of the night of the four or five maces
[13309.36s -> 13317.39s]  What I will stand for the low mark have you dissed my maze come off of it. What is this? This is real maze
[13317.87s -> 13319.87s]  Look at the mini-map
[13320.27s -> 13324.51s]  Oh mini-map, okay. I just met doug doug for the first time like fucking a month ago
[13324.51s -> 13326.51s]  Oh
[13329.95s -> 13334.35s]  I literally am lost. I do not know how to get out of this. So we might need to stall for okay
[13334.35s -> 13340.53s]  Whoa another ghost watch out for that ghost. Wait. Oh i'm back the entrance. Okay, that's not a bit. I'm
[13340.93s -> 13343.17s]  Okay, hold on. We'll get to the end one sec. All right
[13343.73s -> 13347.81s]  As you continue along your haunted mansion it gets scary and scarier
[13348.13s -> 13350.61s]  Did the creators of dougney land even finish this maze?
[13350.69s -> 13352.37s]  Is there anything actually waiting at the end?
[13352.37s -> 13357.97s]  Is it going to be as scary as those ghosts have been until finally you go even farther and you reveal
[13358.70s -> 13367.97s]  jared fogel's bedroom with a children's bed in front of it truly a haunted ride that any
[13368.77s -> 13376.83s]  Man or child would love that's pretty fucking funny questions on a haunted mansion that I
[13377.31s -> 13379.63s]  Honestly, you're the first of all you're the first person
[13379.71s -> 13382.67s]  You're the first person that made a real maze. Look at the mini-map
[13382.91s -> 13386.06s]  Look at the mini-map go back to the maze and go into the mini-map
[13387.41s -> 13391.41s]  You had actual places where you couldn't really go and then you had to go through a different spot
[13391.49s -> 13398.42s]  You got lost in your own maze that that's a disaster complexity intentionally, right that
[13400.36s -> 13403.34s]  Complexity, I got you at a 98 right now, by the way
[13403.90s -> 13409.82s]  A 98 and let me tell you this is just I am lost one second. This is just haunted mansion
[13409.90s -> 13413.50s]  All right, don't even get me started on adventure land. Okay, here we go. Here we go
[13413.50s -> 13413.90s]  All right
[13413.90s -> 13417.02s]  So as you leave the haunted mansion, uh, you're a little spooked, right?
[13417.02s -> 13420.62s]  You need something to to chill out with maybe you want to go to tomorrow land
[13420.86s -> 13427.90s]  The future of tomorrow or whatever walt disney said and tomorrow land is uh, all of the highest technology that uh, we could find
[13428.75s -> 13430.34s]  Uh, there's
[13430.34s -> 13435.56s]  Oh, there's technological cubes. There's technological cubes. Look at these tech cubes. I think it's a cabinet
[13435.94s -> 13443.22s]  There's technological paintings, which I don't think anybody else had the walls fully tiled with some of the most cyberpunk tomorrow land stuff
[13443.22s -> 13448.11s]  You can find and a bed. I do have furniture in this house. Yes. Okay. I I do have a question
[13449.22s -> 13457.14s]  Yes, what is the philosophy of the placement of the technological cubes because they look a little scattered. Yeah, have you um
[13458.22s -> 13467.82s]  Seen the movie alien. Yes, it was random. I've just put them everywhere. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Yeah, that looks fantastic
[13467.82s -> 13472.78s]  I love it. I love tomorrow world whatever you're going to call it in your royalty free copyright free version
[13473.55s -> 13476.19s]  Right, right. Right. Yeah, it's it's fair use because
[13477.22s -> 13482.18s]  Of the cubes, um, let's head back downstairs. I want to show you our backyard
[13482.50s -> 13487.79s]  Okay, other people tried to make prim and proper little boring lawns. Nobody likes that. Nobody likes suburbia
[13487.79s -> 13492.67s]  What you want is adventure land this outdoor has a mix of different plants and foliage
[13492.67s -> 13496.19s]  It even has a swimming pool that the deep end has a swimming pool
[13496.75s -> 13502.69s]  Adventure land is something for everybody. Look at this bonsai tree pretty cool, right? This is actually a pretty damn good backyard
[13503.47s -> 13506.72s]  There we go. Oh
[13508.22s -> 13514.77s]  I I'm I am I am I don't know doug doug. This is this is looking pretty solid
[13515.25s -> 13519.94s]  Uh, can I can I can you do me a favor? Yeah, could you go to the garage?
[13522.82s -> 13529.73s]  Sorry, you mean what garage I would like you to go to the garage the garage doug. Are you talking about?
[13530.35s -> 13535.89s]  Germaversal studios that place is a dump. My park is much better. Don't go anywhere near germaversal
[13536.13s -> 13540.70s]  I love how you just put it. Well, I want you to open the garage
[13542.22s -> 13547.74s]  Open it the standards at germaversal studios are very subpar. I don't even think they have a ride in here
[13550.86s -> 13553.02s]  I appreciate the fact that you hid the garage
[13554.77s -> 13558.85s]  Yeah, that park sucks. Yeah, there's not much in that there's not much in that park
[13559.33s -> 13565.50s]  Not much in that park certainly not the happiest place on earth now. It's very clean. It's very clean
[13566.99s -> 13574.99s]  The parking lot there's a parking lot. Yeah, I took out the garage door and put in a wall
[13576.03s -> 13576.83s]  Okay, all right
[13576.83s -> 13581.54s]  But why is there a door to the park how a car is supposed to get in here dog dog dog dog?
[13581.54s -> 13586.10s]  What's that right there in the lower left next to the door? Oh boy. Um that
[13586.90s -> 13588.62s]  somebody
[13588.62s -> 13594.54s]  Um miss did park their car in the wrong spot. The door is not the door is not even in the frame either
[13596.21s -> 13600.29s]  But that's again some rogue driver. Yeah, have you been to disneyland? Have you been to the parking lot?
[13600.29s -> 13606.77s]  These people do not know how to drive. Can I ask a question germa? I hate to cut in. Yeah, go ahead. Why?
[13607.41s -> 13612.53s]  Was the garage not the parking lot germa germa?
[13613.01s -> 13617.44s]  Excuse me. Hold on. That's true. Why was the garage not the parking lot?
[13619.10s -> 13622.70s]  Look, you have to build around what the people want some guy
[13623.34s -> 13626.78s]  Charges ford f-150 through my walls and made a huge mess
[13626.86s -> 13629.50s]  And so I built the walls around it and that became the parking lot
[13629.58s -> 13633.62s]  That's why there's this disaster here. None of this was my fault. Well, life gives you lemons
[13634.62s -> 13641.82s]  I do appreciate the parking sign though. That is very nice. I do love it. It is parking for a segue
[13641.90s -> 13645.30s]  Can we go into the body? Can we go into the ball pit? Oh, yeah. Yeah
[13645.38s -> 13653.71s]  So one of our most popular rides is ball pit land and if you've been wondering where the bathroom is, don't worry
[13654.11s -> 13657.71s]  Splash mountain has you covered. I was just gonna ask it multiple
[13658.27s -> 13661.31s]  Pools that you can swim and frolic in and if you need to go to the bathroom
[13661.31s -> 13664.19s]  We do have a urinal at the very end if you can kind of jump up
[13664.35s -> 13667.55s]  Yeah, I was gonna say are you are you peeing out of the water to get to that?
[13668.69s -> 13673.17s]  Um, I think if you jump across you could sort of time it in bursts
[13674.40s -> 13678.70s]  What about the if you take a shit you go in the pool so nobody is swimming in these pools
[13680.11s -> 13685.63s]  Well, I was sort of thinking maybe the middle one would be the shit pool and then splash mountain is the first and the third
[13687.92s -> 13688.88s]  Okay, I get it
[13688.88s -> 13693.44s]  So so only so one of these is used as a place to go to use the bathroom and the other ones could be used
[13693.44s -> 13698.27s]  As a pool that's that's i'm pretty sure if we put enough chlorine in these nobody's is gonna notice
[13698.59s -> 13704.18s]  So i'm gonna dock you on cleanliness for a minute. That's filthy. Uh, i'm gonna have to drop you on cleanliness
[13704.83s -> 13708.75s]  Have you ever been you know, like a wave pool those things are bright yellow. All right
[13708.83s -> 13711.79s]  Everybody just puts up with it. That's part of the amusement park experience
[13712.27s -> 13715.31s]  I am torn because you have philosophically probably
[13716.77s -> 13721.47s]  One of the best I would say one of the best grades here philosophically speaking
[13722.24s -> 13728.61s]  This is wonderful and i'm trying to figure out is this a 95? Is this a higher score?
[13728.85s -> 13734.06s]  Is this a 96 or is this I?
[13734.62s -> 13738.43s]  I'm i'm epcot you have epcot. We've got
[13740.03s -> 13746.56s]  Every other contestant has been spot checked on the corner next to the garage. That's true
[13746.88s -> 13752.05s]  Can we see the corner of the garage dog dog corner? Oh, oh, right. Right. Right. Yeah
[13752.13s -> 13759.54s]  See that as part of our adventure land expansion was left untidy. Let me back. Let's check it
[13760.86s -> 13764.14s]  Oh, um, I have no everybody neglected hooligans at this park
[13764.14s -> 13768.30s]  Everybody needs to get in there and kick them out. We're if and if the park is successful enough
[13768.30s -> 13769.66s]  We will purchase
[13769.66s -> 13772.94s]  Germaversal studios and just kick them out of here. This has gone on too long
[13773.18s -> 13776.30s]  I'm going to give you a 100 on creativity because I really think you deserve it
[13776.94s -> 13779.74s]  I think I think you actually deserve a perfect score for creativity
[13780.70s -> 13788.61s]  I think you absolutely nailed it. This took you had to bring in custom things here and I think you absolutely crushed it
[13789.01s -> 13791.01s]  On complexity i'm going to give you a 94
[13791.57s -> 13793.57s]  There was some there was some
[13793.73s -> 13795.73s]  Doors that weren't really in their own place
[13795.89s -> 13799.57s]  There were some walls that were constructionally had some problems the garage had wasn't anything there
[13799.81s -> 13802.45s]  There also was the problem with the dirt and then the debris
[13803.17s -> 13807.44s]  To the left of the garage, but I do think it was phenomenal. Do you have a second floor?
[13809.28s -> 13813.28s]  Uh, yeah, that's tomorrow land. So that yes, right that was that was part of the second floor, right?
[13813.28s -> 13818.62s]  Okay, so just making sure like this is all there was on the second floor. That's nothing behind
[13818.62s -> 13821.10s]  Okay, and the door if we see the tomorrow land door
[13822.35s -> 13828.03s]  It's a little also perfectly locked into place you see in the future of tomorrow
[13828.59s -> 13837.02s]  Doors are more of a philosophical concept very philosophical. I might add I love it. I think it was fantastic
[13837.02s -> 13839.02s]  I think you're going to get probably at least an a
[13839.36s -> 13846.13s]  Uh, we need to see what chat says what is chat giving for a grade chat is also giving you an a so you that is also
[13846.13s -> 13852.82s]  That is a full nine. That is a 95 from chat. Thank you. You've got a you've got a great great score here
[13852.90s -> 13862.05s]  Let's figure it out. You're gonna be a pretty high probably top of the class. I'd say pretty high 94 in complexity a
[13862.61s -> 13865.97s]  90 and cleanliness of that back area really gets everybody
[13866.89s -> 13874.77s]  Philosophy, I feel like you did a lot with your philosophy here. I think it's a little low
[13875.52s -> 13882.62s]  Hey, and you got to admit with the doors consistent consistent philosophy throughout. I'm gonna give you a 97 for philosophy. Let's go
[13883.42s -> 13885.90s]  I really think that it should be somewhere higher than a day
[13888.06s -> 13891.58s]  And then chats grade is also an a which puts you at a grand total of
[13895.53s -> 13897.96s]  96.0
[13899.55s -> 13902.72s]  Thank you chef. It's alex is currently at 96.5
[13904.75s -> 13911.14s]  Both 96s. You should both should be very proud of yourselves for your creativity complexity cleanliness
[13913.46s -> 13921.63s]  Wonderful wonderful job doug doug. That was fucking phenomenal. Thank you. All right, so we got one more
[13921.71s -> 13923.95s]  We have connor eats pants is the last one
[13924.43s -> 13928.99s]  Right, no, oh my god, why can I not think you know why?
[13931.15s -> 13933.15s]  No, get jared off the screen
[13933.63s -> 13935.63s]  Jared jump scared me jared jump scared me
[13936.11s -> 13942.27s]  It's because it's because i'm looking over at my sheet and because we moved you you're like not on the sheet over here anymore
[13942.27s -> 13944.27s]  So you're like out of my brain
[13944.35s -> 13951.95s]  All right. It's your turn rt. I promise I promise I promise I promise I promise. All right, let's let's get it
[13951.95s -> 13953.95s]  Let's get it. Let's get it
[13954.91s -> 13958.99s]  Um stream quality is a better text readability and 30 fps. Is it? Yes
[13960.56s -> 13966.16s]  Go he hates rt. He hates rt. It's cord crashing is going to be your worst nightmare now
[13967.14s -> 13972.02s]  No, you had the opportunity and the discord just all right. Let me take a look. Uh, can you move around?
[13972.26s -> 13976.26s]  It's it's actually okay. Um, I'm actually glad i'm going at the spot
[13976.26s -> 13978.34s]  I did because I think what my house here
[13978.90s -> 13983.22s]  There's going to be a little bit of anticipation because I actually gonna quote germa here
[13983.70s -> 13988.58s]  If your whole house was a barbie house, it would have been a lot higher. It was a view in criken's house
[13989.22s -> 13992.58s]  Um, no, i've actually produced a no
[13993.78s -> 13995.78s]  barbie dream house
[13996.18s -> 13999.62s]  Uh based on the old doll house toys
[14000.26s -> 14002.26s]  Um for you to play with today
[14002.82s -> 14007.14s]  Um, let's make our way on side. But first and foremost haven't just left this out here
[14007.22s -> 14011.95s]  What do you mean you haven't left it out here? Here's some strawberry ice cream take with you
[14012.75s -> 14015.25s]  We thought about it. Oh, we thought about it thematically
[14015.71s -> 14018.51s]  Oh shit, let's step on and holy shit
[14018.67s -> 14023.47s]  Was to try and get the classic feel of a traditional barbie playhouse, you know
[14023.47s -> 14029.47s]  So it's a bit plasticky feeling as you go through it, but the colors uniform have a little elegance of style
[14029.55s -> 14031.55s]  You have your nice windows. You have your lights
[14032.43s -> 14037.95s]  A little bit of air to kind of get in here retro tv kind of because you would you would have like kind of old toys
[14038.03s -> 14040.75s]  Based on this like kind of little old things that you stick in the house
[14041.15s -> 14043.47s]  When you play with one of these toys sets back in the day
[14043.95s -> 14044.75s]  You know
[14044.75s -> 14050.03s]  I tried to kind of really base it on kind of like the earlier ones from the 60s when mattel were making these way way back
[14050.27s -> 14054.19s]  So we've actually got open access back just so you can kind of get your hands in there
[14054.19s -> 14057.63s]  You know if you're playing with as a kid, you've got your kitchen unit. Of course, you can play with it, too
[14058.19s -> 14061.23s]  You also have a complete pool side
[14061.79s -> 14064.99s]  Beach area we've sanded down a lot of the garden here
[14064.99s -> 14069.95s]  But also some grassy patches just to try and make it look distinct got to get the barbie brandon in here as well
[14070.03s -> 14070.51s]  Sure
[14070.51s -> 14075.55s]  Okay, you get a lot of stickers of barbie in these old play sets too just to really kind of hammer home
[14076.19s -> 14078.99s]  What it is, you know, they're big on the brand and they were back in the day
[14079.63s -> 14084.43s]  We built our own little bench here assemble this so you can just have it like a nice little hold on pause for a second pause
[14084.67s -> 14088.27s]  This is all very wonderful. You've even got the little dirt. You've got the dirt
[14088.75s -> 14094.26s]  Under the bench in an artistic way on it and like because your legs are going to kick some of it away
[14094.34s -> 14099.06s]  No, we thought about that. Yeah, that's just like you you've shaped it. You've you've sculpted this
[14099.14s -> 14104.83s]  This is this is a sculpture. This is a sculpture you've made. Okay, continue. You're way too kind
[14104.91s -> 14105.95s]  You're way too kind
[14105.95s -> 14108.19s]  We have like a more little sticker of barbie here as well
[14108.19s -> 14109.87s]  Just so she greets you when you're coming in the door
[14109.87s -> 14112.19s]  You have a lot of these things just as you go about in the house
[14112.91s -> 14114.91s]  Uh, if we take a look upstairs
[14115.23s -> 14120.67s]  We tried again to just try and give this kind of an open feeling. We got all the essentials here is all the clothes
[14121.47s -> 14124.67s]  Um, you know because barbie famous for our fashion through the years
[14124.75s -> 14126.91s]  We really want to make sure that we have that as part of it
[14127.23s -> 14129.07s]  Here is classic kind of style bedroom
[14129.07s -> 14131.31s]  We went for a bit of an urban feel maybe in the back a bit
[14131.55s -> 14134.51s]  But also kind of want to keep it true to barbie have that in here
[14134.83s -> 14138.03s]  Was the were the walls not being pink a time constraint?
[14139.38s -> 14141.38s]  No, no, it was actually it was a deliberate choice
[14141.38s -> 14146.98s]  We wanted that kind of the contrast in background because it makes these walls pop more if you actually have a brick wall in the back
[14147.30s -> 14149.86s]  It's what in a lot of urban dwellings, you'll kind of get that look
[14150.82s -> 14155.70s]  And actually they incorporated that in some of the classic barbie dream houses. I'll have you know, my grandmother had one
[14157.01s -> 14161.33s]  That's true. Somebody look that up. Is that true? Somebody look that up if it's true. I'll I'll put it higher
[14163.50s -> 14167.58s]  We have a wardrobe room here as well. Of course, you know, you can go through your outfits
[14167.98s -> 14169.98s]  Um now we do have one bit now
[14170.70s -> 14175.42s]  This is classic and I debated doing it this way. Okay. Um
[14176.22s -> 14179.81s]  There is an extensive use of stickers in old barbie homes
[14180.21s -> 14185.17s]  Especially for details like toilets and that because you only get so much plastic in this set
[14185.65s -> 14187.49s]  So you really make use of yes
[14187.49s -> 14192.69s]  they make use of sticker elements for some of these features in the house because otherwise it would just
[14193.01s -> 14198.13s]  Ramp up the retail price and I want to try and stay true to the vision of it being a toy
[14198.61s -> 14204.77s]  And you know affordable in that sense. Ludwig Ludwig. This is a history lesson. It's not about a guy that murdered people
[14208.77s -> 14211.73s]  This is this is the majority of the house here
[14212.05s -> 14217.49s]  Um, we can hop back outside. We have working lights as well. We wired all these they work you have working lights
[14217.57s -> 14220.29s]  Are you the only one that made working lights in the whole game?
[14221.33s -> 14224.29s]  No, wait, somebody else did sure did somebody else have working lights?
[14224.93s -> 14232.77s]  I don't think anybody had working functioning electricity. I did. I just forgot to show it but oh, okay. All right
[14233.17s -> 14235.17s]  He's already killed me by now
[14235.49s -> 14237.49s]  He's all right. You've already died already
[14238.13s -> 14243.09s]  We can take now we can just sit by the pool with our lovely strawberry ice cream and just soak in the day
[14243.65s -> 14246.46s]  We have flowers all over the garden. Yeah, can I see the flowers?
[14247.36s -> 14249.68s]  Yeah, of course. We have a lot like that on the purple ones here
[14249.68s -> 14253.60s]  We have these kind of like this border edge guard of these kind of plastic pots
[14254.16s -> 14260.00s]  And I kind of want it's weird because i'm trying to represent this feeling a bit of plastic as we kind of go about the property
[14260.88s -> 14263.84s]  Um, because again, I like the toys were the reference point for this
[14264.48s -> 14268.40s]  Stock up on some more strawberry ice cream rt. Can you open the garage, please?
[14270.00s -> 14274.16s]  So I did think about the garage in official dream houses back in the day
[14274.24s -> 14279.36s]  The garage would actually be sold separately as would barbie's car. So it's not included
[14281.82s -> 14283.50s]  It's not included
[14283.50s -> 14289.66s]  I actually wanted to remove the garage entirely in the property because to kind of hammer home that idea of it being sold separately
[14290.14s -> 14291.10s]  um
[14291.10s -> 14296.46s]  Because it wouldn't be included. That would be a separate playset and we were focused on barbie's dream clubhouse here
[14297.42s -> 14299.23s]  All right
[14299.23s -> 14301.79s]  That that's a good answer. That's a good answer
[14303.38s -> 14309.49s]  Can you check the corner to the left of the garage? Uh, the corner to the left of the garage sure thing. Just one sec
[14312.42s -> 14315.38s]  It's clean. Oh you keep you get to keep the 100 on clean
[14316.18s -> 14321.62s]  No, don't worry attention to detail like, you know, like I want to keep the garden kind of nice pristine and proper
[14322.26s -> 14326.42s]  Um, I really like actually like kind of like adding the sand in this um as we were going about it, too
[14326.42s -> 14330.10s]  I just thought I added a bit just sort of a bit of contrast from like kind of just
[14330.66s -> 14334.50s]  Modern suburbia that you're getting here and like everyone just doing kind of grassy gardens
[14334.50s -> 14336.90s]  I thought it would look a bit more distinct and again
[14336.90s -> 14341.14s]  It's the idea of kind of dream clubhouse and thinking of the beach and things like that
[14341.38s -> 14347.22s]  Yeah, the the sand is bringing me to the beach. That's really wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful
[14347.94s -> 14349.73s]  Thank you very much
[14349.73s -> 14355.97s]  Uh, I have to i'm fighting with giving you a 98 or a 100 on creativity. I'm trying to uh, 98
[14357.38s -> 14359.38s]  It's a 98. I think for creativity
[14360.37s -> 14364.13s]  It could be 100 that is very kind that is very kind of you
[14365.09s -> 14368.66s]  It's a 90
[14368.66s -> 14370.96s]  It's a 90
[14370.96s -> 14373.79s]  It's a
[14373.79s -> 14374.75s]  Oh
[14374.75s -> 14376.74s]  It's a 99
[14376.74s -> 14381.06s]  It's an oh my god. You're all right your creativity. I'm giving you a 99
[14382.21s -> 14383.65s]  your
[14383.65s -> 14388.27s]  Your complexity i'm giving you an 89 and it's not because it's not a complex house
[14388.35s -> 14395.25s]  It's because it's it's a it's a more it's it's it's a home. This is a regular home. It's not it's not a very complex home
[14395.90s -> 14399.98s]  This is a a home. This is like modeled after those old barbie toys
[14400.46s -> 14405.42s]  Which is exactly the old barbie toys. So you don't actually want too much clutter in there
[14405.50s -> 14410.46s]  Exactly. I've tried i've tried to kind of push over though and add as much details as I can like stuff with the lights and that
[14410.70s -> 14414.94s]  That's true. You know getting plants inside just to kind of make it look nice, but your philosophy
[14414.94s -> 14419.50s]  You've got a 100 that that this I think you've you nailed it on sticking with a theme
[14420.24s -> 14424.16s]  You pulled the theme the whole time. There's not a whole lot of structural problems
[14424.40s -> 14430.11s]  It's very very nicely made all the wiring works in the house. Everything works. That's a 100 for philosophy
[14430.11s -> 14433.23s]  That's a 100 for cleanliness. This is going to be you're going to be isn't really close
[14433.63s -> 14437.62s]  You might be ahead of the class. We're going to see what chat's greatest chat is
[14439.06s -> 14443.14s]  Chat is unanimously giving you an an a 95. Oh my god
[14443.98s -> 14448.75s]  So I think it's very possible. Let we'll do a little bit of the math here. Hold on a second
[14449.15s -> 14454.29s]  We got you at 99. You're way too kind chat. Thank you. Got you 90 for complexity
[14454.85s -> 14461.89s]  Which is 100 ask is there a difference in chat's grade if it's unanimous does that make it 100 or is it a 95 max?
[14461.97s -> 14466.34s]  It's just 95 max just to make it sort of point wise was easier to calculate
[14466.58s -> 14470.98s]  Nobody is going to get a 100 like it's impossible, right? Okay, it's impossible. Great. Great. Great
[14471.06s -> 14473.70s]  Impossible to get a 100 make sense why I didn't get it make sense why I didn't get it
[14475.70s -> 14478.98s]  Well, i'm not gonna for your other reasons, but uh, i'll get you at a
[14479.62s -> 14492.24s]  Drum roll, please ladies and gentlemen rt game is currently at the head of the class with a 96.65
[14492.94s -> 14496.46s]  One tenth of a point higher than his alex. Oh my god
[14496.54s -> 14503.07s]  I actually five tenths of a point higher than doug doug freaking dare you
[14503.55s -> 14505.07s]  That I don't want to be a buzzkill
[14505.07s -> 14510.19s]  But doug neeland does own the rights to barbie and we will be sending you a cease and desist. Oh, that's true
[14511.09s -> 14514.11s]  That's true
[14514.11s -> 14518.67s]  Look the two people who might beat me italics and the barbie house both cheating the law legally
[14519.63s -> 14521.63s]  Listen there can be a brand opportunity
[14522.91s -> 14528.67s]  Mattel is very powerful as I imagine doug neeland is our lawyers will talk right we can work something out here
[14528.99s -> 14535.55s]  We got a killer cut of the ten thousand dollar prize pool that germa put up we can agree to that
[14535.63s -> 14536.58s]  Yeah
[14536.58s -> 14538.82s]  Well, it was actually it was actually a hundred thousand
[14538.82s -> 14541.62s]  But I mean, I don't know why you I don't know why you said it was so low
[14542.02s -> 14547.36s]  But I am okay with this being the model house that germa recreates from scratch rather than doug neeland
[14548.00s -> 14552.27s]  A hundred thousand dollar prize pool. Oh, no, no, no
[14552.91s -> 14555.07s]  All right. That was fucking phenomenal rt
[14555.47s -> 14558.83s]  Uh, thank you very much. You're way too kind. Thank you everyone. It's

[14571.87s -> 14577.82s]  Everyone this was a lot of fun. Thanks everybody so much. We got one more. We've got con reeds pants house
[14580.58s -> 14584.34s]  I had a so I had a theme or something. I went for here. Okay

[14595.79s -> 14604.05s]  Oh, let me check it while I load it. I am loading your stream, but it is freezing. Let me
[14605.07s -> 14607.68s]  retry
[14607.68s -> 14611.68s]  Okay, there we go. I can see it. Uh, you look you look pretty good on my end
[14612.64s -> 14616.72s]  I think let me get rid of these grades for rt. I'll tell you when you can go
[14617.04s -> 14620.00s]  So you said you you have a theme that you're going through you said I have a theme
[14620.08s -> 14623.92s]  I'm it's not exactly like a home that you well, I guess you do live in it
[14624.32s -> 14629.68s]  If you're like, I guess someone who's invited to it, but okay, it's not like it's not like a not like a family home
[14630.24s -> 14637.12s]  Uh, it's a it's an orphanage. Um, okay, it's specifically it's a hundred thieves cash app orphanage
[14638.08s -> 14642.48s]  Is what we've made here and if you're wondering about the windows the boards are supposed to be there
[14642.96s -> 14646.32s]  Okay, um, they're supposed to be there so that you know people don't leave
[14647.17s -> 14652.61s]  Um, but yeah, so that those are there for a reason but I I can show you the home check it out in the front yard
[14652.85s -> 14657.17s]  Again, it's an orphanage. So you can't really expect it to always like look so great outside
[14658.37s -> 14661.17s]  There was some digging that didn't look some digging that didn't get done there
[14661.73s -> 14664.69s]  You can listen. We'll get to it. We'll get to it anyways, okay
[14664.77s -> 14669.81s]  And the boards are uh, you're you're you're out of 75 for cleanliness right boards are there for a reason
[14670.51s -> 14676.27s]  Okay, so here we walk in and this is the main room as you can see it's uh red
[14677.07s -> 14681.15s]  We have a couch Connor. We made the same house and I was just sitting there chatting to people
[14682.35s -> 14686.78s]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I could show you my house that I made. Okay. Well, I have a light switch
[14687.89s -> 14692.22s]  That's actually fucking hilarious. All right, go on go on. I don't want to interrupt you though
[14692.22s -> 14696.94s]  They'll let your lights work your lights actually are functioning. They work. Yeah, they work they work. So that's one light

[14718.62s -> 14721.89s]  Um next room over this is the boys room
[14723.14s -> 14729.22s]  We have things boys like like the main characters in michael bay transformers movies like shia laboeuf
[14729.87s -> 14732.18s]  and mark walberg
[14732.50s -> 14734.66s]  Oh, I know camaro because like bumblebee
[14735.63s -> 14736.59s]  um
[14736.59s -> 14742.51s]  So not nothing else besides like nothing else besides transformers. No, well, there's austin's show
[14742.51s -> 14747.87s]  But he's not on hundred thieves anymore. So they had to mark him out. Okay, he used to be on the wall. Okay, I see
[14748.51s -> 14750.75s]  Yeah, and that's just like a window
[14750.99s -> 14754.19s]  Was it like I don't know if there's crutch. Is it a window or is it a is it a pic?
[14754.27s -> 14758.19s]  Can you can you get closer for us? It's a window. I can't I don't know how to crouch
[14759.07s -> 14761.50s]  Uh, I don't think you can okay
[14761.58s -> 14766.22s]  It's actually I might not the kid might have actually put that on the wall next to him to simulate
[14766.54s -> 14773.58s]  Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. Anyways, that was the boys room. Nice. This was an accident
[14773.82s -> 14777.42s]  There's supposed to be like a door here. Fortunately, we won't get into that
[14777.50s -> 14780.06s]  Okay, this is the hundred thieves cash app kitchen juvie
[14780.62s -> 14782.62s]  We have brought to you by courage jd
[14782.94s -> 14785.90s]  And we have courage on the wall. You have a nice sink
[14789.74s -> 14791.74s]  This is where you get the juvie in it
[14792.22s -> 14797.66s]  I'm gonna get okay. I'm for creativity. I mean you may I i'm gonna give you so far. I got you at an 80
[14798.69s -> 14802.37s]  Okay, I got you an 80 so far. Well, we'll keep getting that up. Don't worry
[14802.53s -> 14807.57s]  Okay, this is the back door here is the repurposed from a sears that shut down
[14807.89s -> 14810.69s]  We kind of just took the glass sliding door. We like the blue
[14811.66s -> 14816.67s]  Um, but yeah, so that that's that uh, we could go. I don't know where we could go next
[14816.67s -> 14820.83s]  We could go upstairs next. Yeah, I i'd like to see the upstairs. That would be good again
[14820.99s -> 14826.03s]  It's it's tough to get funding for an orphanage. So they kind of make make what's going on with the window?
[14826.11s -> 14830.40s]  Hold on. Is there a window you got a window here on next to the door to the right?
[14830.96s -> 14838.24s]  Yeah, no like this one. Yeah, is that part of another window or is that a just half window lighting natural lighting?
[14838.32s -> 14841.52s]  Well, the sun is the sun is due south. So it's not hitting you this way
[14841.76s -> 14845.89s]  Well at this time of day, of course, but yeah, I mean hold on. Give me a minute
[14848.42s -> 14854.98s]  There's a sleep button. Oh, you can't sleep with this one. Actually. All right. So what what do you got?
[14855.38s -> 14858.26s]  Oh, you you are the first person to use the house
[14859.38s -> 14861.78s]  Yeah, I think that's worth at least a couple points in philosophy
[14862.42s -> 14864.40s]  And the sun's there somewhere
[14864.40s -> 14865.68s]  anyways, uh
[14865.68s -> 14870.64s]  Upstairs we have we have a couple different usages of the main usage of upstairs is the playroom
[14870.72s -> 14876.16s]  You'll see it in the corner, but okay kind of just having like the the owner's bed is right there
[14876.40s -> 14881.68s]  Okay, and we want to keep it like motivating for the kids. So like we have ted lasso on the wall kids love ted lasso
[14882.54s -> 14884.54s]  Uh, this is uh, this is the bath
[14884.78s -> 14886.78s]  What it's I see says, uh
[14888.61s -> 14894.19s]  I see the one that we first e to do something. Yeah. Well, it's where you close it says call dot. That's for the kid
[14894.27s -> 14896.27s]  That's oh, okay. I see. Okay
[14896.75s -> 14898.75s]  Okay, so this is a toy
[14899.46s -> 14906.94s]  Is there any is there a bathroom? What right here? So that's a wait. So that's a bathroom
[14907.42s -> 14913.94s]  There's no toilet. That's what they use. Well, I okay. Did you not even look in the room? I
[14914.80s -> 14916.67s]  did
[14916.67s -> 14918.94s]  you have
[14918.94s -> 14922.14s]  Bucket. Oh this is okay. That's right. The okay. All right. All right
[14922.38s -> 14923.98s]  I see. I see. I see
[14923.98s -> 14927.10s]  We're not trying to kill the kids. Okay. All right. So now
[14928.43s -> 14934.59s]  What's in that room? Yeah. Anyways, this is like where whoever runs the house would sleep. I guess like nade shot or somebody
[14935.31s -> 14939.79s]  Um, this is the this is the playroom now. I know this looks bad, but
[14940.43s -> 14946.19s]  Kids will be kids boys will be boys. Sometimes things get roughed up. Okay, that's the we're at we're at it
[14946.27s -> 14949.79s]  We're you you your score is unfortunately falling
[14950.27s -> 14952.75s]  After that it's unfortunately falling
[14954.67s -> 14960.42s]  It's a lot of a lot of a lot of dings if the kids are happy then i'm happy and that's what matters
[14960.50s -> 14964.58s]  I don't even need the score. Anyways, this is the playroom. We have a lot of toys for the kids here
[14965.14s -> 14971.60s]  Okay, um, well you can actually hold them. Yeah, you throw it and like they fetch it and then they come back
[14973.95s -> 14975.95s]  This is like a little doll
[14975.95s -> 14977.95s]  I believe okay
[14978.03s -> 14981.55s]  There's some weaponry. There's some security cameras you have okay
[14982.51s -> 14989.22s]  Okay, so we have we have sponsors can I see the garage could I see the garage
[14989.86s -> 14997.58s]  In the interior of the garage here. We have another toy. We've got like an outlet with a fork. Jesus christ
[14998.30s -> 15000.16s]  okay, um
[15000.16s -> 15002.16s]  I I think of course I have
[15002.96s -> 15004.96s]  Your philosophy had to come down a little
[15005.60s -> 15011.46s]  First you have the garage it will get there. Okay, so I wanted to show you this we do like this is still here
[15012.26s -> 15014.26s]  Uh, why is it not clean?
[15014.26s -> 15016.34s]  But when the kids turn 14, that's where they go drink
[15020.19s -> 15024.67s]  Juvie, okay, what's in the garage? I gotta see the garage. Oh, yeah the garage
[15025.33s -> 15028.21s]  This is uh where we get streaming setups. So if they're gonna be in the orphanage
[15028.29s -> 15034.77s]  They want to become streamers obviously and is there anything in the garage? Of course. Oh
[15035.58s -> 15036.98s]  shit
[15036.98s -> 15039.95s]  Okay
[15039.95s -> 15046.67s]  You've actually got a garage. You have a garage setup. That's shocking your setup. All right, we can't we have face cams
[15047.23s -> 15053.41s]  And that does a nice face cams and it's been the perfect place to see somebody's face perfect lineup. She's on hundred thieves
[15054.67s -> 15058.67s]  Yeah, I thank congratulations for making a garage. First of all, that's uh, thank you, of course
[15058.83s -> 15064.51s]  And what what why would you not utilize the garage? That's what's the computer? It was silly. Is that just a regular computer?
[15064.67s -> 15067.15s]  That's a streaming computer. Okay, they're melee players
[15067.71s -> 15073.18s]  Okay, cool. Cool. Okay. All right. I think I think i've got your wait. Hold on. What's in the back?
[15073.73s -> 15075.81s]  You did paint the exterior which is actually a huge deal
[15076.43s -> 15081.41s]  Of course painting the exterior is a big deal. So we're gonna have chat get the grade up for you
[15081.49s -> 15083.73s]  They can uh do it. I can give you what I what I like
[15084.05s -> 15087.81s]  Let's not pretend like there's not an effort made on the lawn because like as you can see the turf here
[15087.97s -> 15093.28s]  The kids lay it out. They mow it they try so you didn't do that. No, the kids do it
[15093.44s -> 15097.98s]  Oh, okay. So you didn't do that. Uh, well, I mean it's done. It's a part of the
[15098.54s -> 15101.30s]  Okay. Yeah, that's fair
[15102.78s -> 15108.77s]  All right. What do we got? What do we got for a chat score? Uh a b c or d you can't go lower than a 60
[15109.42s -> 15114.06s]  Um, i'm not saying that for any particular reasons or anything. I'm just I just wanted to make sure I said it
[15115.41s -> 15117.65s]  All right. I got you 75 for creativity
[15118.35s -> 15122.35s]  Uh, I I do I do I think it's a solid c. I do like the idea
[15122.83s -> 15129.95s]  Of I love what gets what gets a 75 for creativity like over like what what did like the what did like the maze get?
[15130.66s -> 15135.70s]  Uh, you're talking about connor's maze. Yeah, like just like just like just so I have like a comparison
[15136.26s -> 15141.73s]  Connors maze got a also 75 for creativity. Okay. Well that all right. That's yeah
[15142.45s -> 15144.66s]  I would like you to open the front door
[15144.66s -> 15151.94s]  Uh in the front the reason why the 75 is for creativity is because this space although clean and although nicely, you know decorated
[15152.58s -> 15158.42s]  It the the creativity there's a kitchen there in the way the kitchen's supposed to be it's a nice home
[15158.58s -> 15162.50s]  It's a nice house. You made it's a nice interior. I love the idea that you've replicated
[15162.98s -> 15164.98s]  Uh this this uh, this home this house
[15165.38s -> 15168.74s]  It's I believe I believe that's a good but creatively speaking
[15169.22s -> 15172.74s]  I think I could have used a little bit more a little bit more paint on the walls
[15172.74s -> 15174.50s]  Maybe not maybe not so much red
[15174.50s -> 15179.68s]  Uh, and I I would say that 75 is a pretty fair score for creativity on complexity. Yeah, it's not bad
[15179.76s -> 15182.32s]  Can I try I mean I I would like to vouch for my

[16109.95s -> 16115.55s]  It is we are gonna add complexity. I think because he's made it up in his own head and oh, this is fucked up
[16115.79s -> 16121.47s]  This is actually fucked up. Where's the crusty crab? It's more philosophical. I sold it. Yeah, that is philosophical. I sold it
[16121.79s -> 16125.60s]  It's the cabin. No, it's not it's not
[16129.25s -> 16135.06s]  It would be the crusty crab it wouldn't be the cabin that's a mess right there what yeah, that's fucking awful
[16136.34s -> 16142.40s]  Love 60 for cleanliness, right guys. That is the lowest score of course the lowest possible score. Yeah, there's a bit back
[16144.53s -> 16150.54s]  Hold on the presentation on the class computer jerma, you should oh did you just have a 180 in your opinions?
[16150.54s -> 16153.36s]  I think you just did oh it just guys
[16154.00s -> 16156.00s]  It got silent
[16158.08s -> 16164.16s]  This is the wrong building am I am I wrong to say that i'm clipping through the roof. Why don't we take you through?
[16164.32s -> 16166.32s]  What's this? Oh
[16166.32s -> 16168.32s]  25 minutes. Yeah
[16169.12s -> 16172.16s]  It's this go ahead build away build away crusty crab
[16172.24s -> 16176.96s]  That looks pretty interesting doesn't it through the front door as you see this house is perfectly this sign is in the perfect location
[16177.44s -> 16184.58s]  Going through here. We've got the galley grub. There is your ordering station squidward sits right here
[16185.20s -> 16190.10s]  Unbelievably complex complexity philosophy theming idea of the bathtub being the thing that he sits behind
[16191.42s -> 16196.27s]  This is don't worry about this. This is uh, there's nothing you have to worry about that
[16196.75s -> 16200.32s]  Uh, this is uh, hold on
[16200.64s -> 16203.28s]  Why there's a futuristic space just wait just wait just wait just wait
[16204.00s -> 16206.16s]  Go look at what the crusty crab looks like it looks like this
[16208.72s -> 16211.76s]  No, it is pretty accurate to the crusty crab. I'll give you that. Oh
[16212.56s -> 16215.68s]  Crusty crab. This is where spongebob. This is the window in the corner
[16216.24s -> 16219.98s]  Well, you're the kitchen's pretty good. What's that connor said that again?
[16221.42s -> 16223.42s]  Okay, I don't know connor. I'm not seeing any mazes
[16224.14s -> 16229.74s]  Yeah, where did the kids sleep? Where did the orphans go? Yeah, where where's where's the where's like that weird?
[16230.14s -> 16234.26s]  Corner. Yeah, the weird corner. Yeah
[16235.06s -> 16238.26s]  That gave me. Oh, did you have working lights only three of you did?
[16238.94s -> 16242.14s]  Can you show us the uh, could you show us mr. Krabs's room again?
[16243.30s -> 16249.04s]  Uh, this is the bathroom. We don't need it. I said I I I was I got tired when I did this
[16249.60s -> 16251.60s]  And I was like I have to go tired
[16251.60s -> 16256.48s]  But it's always hard to make crusty crabs office. It was hard to do it because they forgot the freezer
[16257.12s -> 16262.94s]  Yeah, that's all right. Yeah, but that side door always be in the kitchen. Like I don't remember that in the manga
[16262.94s -> 16264.38s]  I'll be honest with you
[16264.38s -> 16269.62s]  This is up here. If you didn't know up in the car. What is up here? Oh, what?
[16270.02s -> 16278.48s]  How did you remove the stairs? What the fuck is this? This is a different base home. Oh
[16278.88s -> 16282.80s]  Uh, yeah, some of the houses you can remove the stairs some of them were made more way more customizable than others
[16285.60s -> 16291.28s]  Mr. Krabs goes into hiding. Yeah, the irs is after him and this was you made this in 45 minutes
[16291.36s -> 16293.36s]  Somebody hacked my computer and did this part
[16293.76s -> 16299.34s]  House looks like a gmod man on ttt. Can you go through the those doors? Yeah. Wait, what what is going on?
[16299.42s -> 16301.42s]  Oh, this is somebody hacked my computer into this
[16305.49s -> 16311.33s]  And yes, I did I I I did this in 45 minutes with uh shows the outside
[16311.73s -> 16316.18s]  Yes, you make a vampire shrine to yourself. Yeah fucking weird. I know
[16316.82s -> 16318.82s]  I wish I was a vampire too
[16319.22s -> 16322.34s]  I what's the idea behind the the weeds in the straw because
[16322.74s -> 16326.58s]  The house flipper actually grows grass and I haven't been in this house for like four months
[16328.11s -> 16331.47s]  What's the what's the deal with that balcony on the side of the house? Can you look at that again?
[16331.55s -> 16335.97s]  Which one left side of the crusty crab? Oh, um
[16336.53s -> 16340.69s]  So what's going on there? Well, you can I'll figure it out. I could figure a question doug
[16340.85s -> 16344.93s]  By the way, where are all the animals because they were like, where's the maze?
[16345.97s -> 16349.25s]  Oh, and you didn't even say anything about my oh, it's nothing's here. There was like a bunch of problems
[16350.94s -> 16352.22s]  No maze. Okay
[16352.22s -> 16356.06s]  Uh, where are the animals? They were like 15 animals that were like running around
[16357.90s -> 16362.62s]  Well, they gotta make the burger somehow. So did you remember to plan this whole tournament so you could show us this house
[16365.26s -> 16370.86s]  Can you can you a really really cool shot above that that gray thing in the back to see what's back there
[16371.44s -> 16375.76s]  Okay, you want you want me to just go up and take a look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah if you could you got it
[16375.84s -> 16382.96s]  Are you for grappling hook? Yeah, there's a great. I'll do wait. Oh, you mean back here?
[16383.62s -> 16387.10s]  Yeah, there's like a trap door or something. Oh, that is weird. What is that?
[16387.50s -> 16396.21s]  Oh, what's going on here? That should be illegal
[16397.57s -> 16404.13s]  That I didn't put that there. I don't like that. I didn't put that there you want someone to climb down from the ceiling all your table
[16404.13s -> 16410.99s]  I don't think I put that there. I'm comfortable. Uh, we're gonna take points off for cleanliness. It's gonna be a plus in complexity minus in philosophy
[16411.07s -> 16417.44s]  All right, what's my grade the smell so bad? You have to escape through the hatch. I mean honestly, I thought
[16418.58s -> 16421.38s]  You guys want to go ahead first? Well, what do you guys think for creativity?
[16421.78s -> 16425.38s]  Creativity, it's definitely got to be high, you know, it's pretty high. I thought at least
[16426.74s -> 16428.62s]  Yeah, I think that's fair
[16428.62s -> 16435.34s]  I one thing that bothered me is that the sign wasn't on its own post because that to me is the defining feature the crusty crab
[16435.82s -> 16440.22s]  Is its own definitive sign and he just he just left it on the front like a like a like a
[16440.93s -> 16446.37s]  Like he doesn't have the mcdonald's arches game limitation. It's not even transparent. It's just a you know, like a white
[16446.45s -> 16448.05s]  Yeah, just png
[16448.05s -> 16453.97s]  Wait, jk to the you know plankton's home nearby. So it's really geographically vague where we are
[16454.37s -> 16456.37s]  Yeah, that's right. You're right
[16458.29s -> 16460.45s]  90 creativity on like established ip
[16461.57s -> 16467.17s]  Well, how much time did germa have on this house 45 minutes five plus about three and a half hours
[16467.49s -> 16469.07s]  You've clocked in like
[16469.07s -> 16470.93s]  65 000 hours
[16470.93s -> 16472.85s]  I I have barely played this game
[16472.93s -> 16475.97s]  All right, and i'm trying to get extra points here at them and i'm just saying
[16476.37s -> 16481.73s]  With the amount of time you you know from this game. You should have been able to shit out of mona lisa in no time
[16482.29s -> 16488.77s]  But no gary no spongebob. No nosferatu. You're not gonna make it in hollywood. No, it's brought to excuse me
[16489.41s -> 16491.41s]  That's a good point. No nosferatu
[16491.49s -> 16496.05s]  He did make the whole vampire. He does have a nose for us. Yeah, he did actually have a vampire room in fairness
[16496.13s -> 16500.13s]  Yeah, come on. Yeah, and so I in fact, let's let's touch on that for a moment
[16500.53s -> 16504.77s]  I thought because of the vampire room for me philosophy was the highest score. I put 95
[16505.97s -> 16507.57s]  Well now on philosophy
[16507.57s -> 16513.33s]  I don't know just because of that hatch to access the toilet because like what have you just taken a shit and someone like
[16513.41s -> 16518.53s]  Climbs down from the ceiling like what I know. Yeah, I put 60 that's some weird philosophy. I don't know
[16519.81s -> 16521.33s]  I do have work
[16521.73s -> 16525.17s]  You may be able to take a shit on the roof and have it drop down into the toilet though
[16525.57s -> 16531.73s]  Nah, the angle makes that impossible to be frank, but the detail detail not with my kind of firepower the detail though
[16537.09s -> 16541.49s]  No, but that's that's not that's that's nothing go look at the interior of crusty crab
[16544.29s -> 16547.89s]  Look at how the wood falls. Why is there a trough for cows?
[16550.13s -> 16553.49s]  They were like 10 barn animals that lived here and I don't know where they are
[16553.65s -> 16558.69s]  I don't know where they went. They're actually supposed to be lost barn animals minus
[16559.81s -> 16561.81s]  I think they're dead
[16562.13s -> 16564.19s]  I don't know what happened to the animals
[16564.19s -> 16570.11s]  Yeah, while we're doing the grade and I I think the mods are sharing that chat's vote has come in with an f unfortunately
[16570.51s -> 16572.51s]  That's both. No, that's bullshit. That's
[16574.35s -> 16576.99s]  Deserve an f but it is the majority of the votes
[16581.15s -> 16583.39s]  Okay, so that's 60 that's so let me do okay fine
[16584.91s -> 16590.99s]  Creativity, what do you got for me creativity? I think 90 a 90. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's established ip though
[16591.81s -> 16595.97s]  But barbie house, we gave a high but it's fine. That's fine. Okay. It's fine. Oh, okay
[16597.09s -> 16599.09s]  For an hundred thieves orphanage
[16603.57s -> 16610.45s]  Complexity I think I think um, it was there's some like cool elements like the door the sliding doors
[16611.25s -> 16614.91s]  Um, like even like the posters I think they're kind of cool
[16615.84s -> 16619.36s]  Uh, hey, but but if you open up look at the interior of the crusty crab
[16619.92s -> 16624.38s]  You wouldn't have put these here lugwig the troughs. Yeah. No, no, no
[16625.42s -> 16629.82s]  I'm talking about this these pillars with the trap door to the bathroom so that perverts can enter
[16629.90s -> 16632.94s]  Yeah, between it's either between the I don't think you would have done this
[16632.94s -> 16638.06s]  I don't think I think you would have just kept the tables as they were you told us specifically just now to look up images
[16638.06s -> 16644.62s]  Of the interior so I did uh, and they're all rectangular like the interior of the crusty crab is one big rectangle
[16645.90s -> 16652.35s]  That's true. You know, let's go with maybe 85 for complexity. Yeah, I think I honestly
[16656.43s -> 16662.91s]  70 what I think 70 you're just on the trap door that went up to the the room was kind of cool
[16664.78s -> 16668.14s]  And the beams were are nice until you realize it's just empty space
[16670.46s -> 16672.94s]  How about an 80 how about an 80 I can do it
[16673.82s -> 16680.70s]  Yeah, but we should divide the score by how much time was spent making the item 45 minutes plus four hours hours
[16681.34s -> 16685.26s]  Well, I think chad's vote went into account that because they gave him an f. I know I think I think
[16686.30s -> 16690.72s]  Yeah, sergeant go ahead. Okay. Yeah, I took longer doing this but I wasn't timed
[16691.14s -> 16694.66s]  I sat around we we watched like three or four youtube videos
[16694.98s -> 16696.82s]  We went off on like a food tangent
[16696.82s -> 16699.94s]  There was like at least two or three hours of that stream where I wasn't even playing house flipper
[16700.42s -> 16706.72s]  Little baby said what I could repeat it. So what what uh, what happened was I was watching videos
[16706.80s -> 16708.48s]  I was watching like three or four videos
[16708.48s -> 16712.24s]  And then we did like a whole nother thing that we were talking about food and stuff
[16712.40s -> 16715.54s]  Did you hear me that time? No, I heard you that time a lot. I'm clear
[16715.62s -> 16721.62s]  Okay, I think uh, I appreciate that the the one thing that we're gonna talk about deeply is cleanliness
[16722.96s -> 16729.68s]  Yeah, yeah, and how troll? Oh, yeah, the trough was for the animals that we I put this in the last second
[16729.76s -> 16731.76s]  60
[16734.08s -> 16740.24s]  What is dirty here every look at how everything is perfectly clean you made it you made a restaurant with a trough inside
[16740.32s -> 16742.32s]  I can put my hand on the wall damn scores
[16742.74s -> 16747.70s]  Look at this even the bathroom the bathroom is immaculate. Look at every single one of it and no shits in here
[16747.86s -> 16751.86s]  No piss buckets in here. These are all clean. I think it's not clean though
[16751.94s -> 16755.78s]  The fact that you're shitting in an open everyone you're shitting next to someone. There's no there's no look
[16755.94s -> 16758.02s]  You got a ventilation system here ventilation
[16758.98s -> 16764.42s]  Why are the toilet stalls that's not why isn't there any doors on yeah, why that's not clean at all because you can't put them
[16765.17s -> 16768.93s]  I I feel like it might show my eyes if some of the lower score makes this call
[16769.17s -> 16772.53s]  Rt, what do you think for cleanliness? Because you had the highest score
[16772.93s -> 16779.81s]  I'm just trying to i'm trying to think of in relation to the spongebob lore and the crusty crab actually is notoriously not clean
[16779.89s -> 16780.37s]  And mr
[16780.37s -> 16781.73s]  crabs is like
[16781.73s -> 16786.37s]  Deploying all kinds of techniques to just keep it vaguely afloat when it's filthy
[16786.53s -> 16790.61s]  It was even an episode about the actual germs and the establishment if anything
[16791.01s -> 16795.41s]  I think the lore should be taken into account in judging that i'm on board with that
[16795.49s -> 16801.09s]  But there's he just knows the trunks wait the lord didn't apply in the grading though because like mine was a messy orphanage
[16801.09s -> 16804.21s]  But it was not messy. That is true in the hundred thieves juvie
[16804.75s -> 16811.98s]  Orphanage would be messy. Yeah, and it also wasn't creative. Oh, but did you have fred in your playthrough? Oh, he's so cute
[16816.78s -> 16818.78s]  All right
[16819.52s -> 16822.08s]  Let's get a grade. Let's get a grade
[16822.08s -> 16825.76s]  Can our can our favorite spongebob character can our a grades all give us a cleanliness score?
[16825.76s -> 16830.00s]  Whoever got an a can you give out a score for cleanliness and we'll find an average zero
[16830.40s -> 16836.91s]  If you're connor, you're obviously a c grade. Thank you very much salty because I gave his maze mustard house of 76
[16839.44s -> 16842.00s]  I'm salty because I got worse than the maze mustard
[16842.80s -> 16847.92s]  That's true. Honestly, honestly after the night after the night and i'm all this drama in this community and this
[16848.48s -> 16852.72s]  You know cataclysm that has happened the only reasonable thing I can see happening from now on
[16853.20s -> 16859.68s]  Is if jerma individually goes through every person and pretends they are the winner and congratulant you won first place
[16859.76s -> 16865.92s]  So we all get validation from this so we can pretend and feel good. Maybe just a dm that I can screenshot
[16866.16s -> 16870.48s]  Yeah, I will dm everybody saying you did a great job
[16871.39s -> 16874.35s]  But ain't nothing better than the crusty crap that will be in
[16875.31s -> 16880.35s]  Well, and you can you can you can crop it you can crop that message and frame it on the wall
[16880.43s -> 16884.51s]  Based on that alone i'm leaning towards giving you uh, you know all the connor's got a c grade
[16884.59s -> 16888.19s]  I think maybe you deserve a j grade too below them. Yeah
[16889.87s -> 16892.91s]  All right, so what am I what am I getting for complexity for real?
[16893.76s -> 16899.84s]  Uh complexity was 80 80 creativity was 90. Okay, so now philosophy is your highest score
[16900.61s -> 16902.91s]  Okay, so what would you say is that is?
[16903.07s -> 16909.50s]  91 are you all agreeing on that? No, did we talk about the alien doors clipping through the wall or no?
[16909.82s -> 16912.22s]  Uh, we didn't grab it up. Yeah
[16913.90s -> 16917.82s]  Can you guys show the doors like look open the door and look at it clip guys like what are we doing here?
[16918.38s -> 16919.82s]  What are we doing here?
[16919.82s -> 16923.58s]  Actually, you know so go in the bathroom go in the bathroom and look at the alien door and go up
[16923.66s -> 16924.94s]  What is that there?
[16924.94s -> 16929.18s]  I mean like look up above the alien like it's events ventilation. It's a ventilation event
[16929.60s -> 16932.80s]  I don't want to start more drama in the community, but like this is really pissing me off
[16933.44s -> 16934.88s]  Oh
[16934.88s -> 16939.60s]  Said it needed to be said I have a monumental point on cleanliness. Here's a please wash your hand sign
[16939.68s -> 16943.44s]  There is no sinks in that toilet. There's only toilet bowls. Where are you gonna wash your hands?
[16944.08s -> 16947.71s]  I mean, they're in the water though. What about in here?
[16947.79s -> 16950.91s]  We're just coming to you. You can come in here like dip your hands in there
[16950.99s -> 16953.95s]  Is there any indication that the water is here? Like how do we look?
[16954.51s -> 16957.07s]  See and did you have teleportation powers in your house?
[16959.31s -> 16962.51s]  I think that gets at least I you didn't even know I had that okay
[16963.15s -> 16968.56s]  Wow, i'm picking up philosophy to 93 for that. I didn't even go in the teleporting pool
[16968.88s -> 16975.78s]  And that's why this is our final call whatever we have for that then we can get our grade gonna say 90
[16976.74s -> 16978.98s]  Chat gave me a 60. Okay
[16978.98s -> 16983.06s]  Philosophy and matt what I said 90 we have our we have our final scores then okay
[16983.06s -> 16990.27s]  So what do you want to do the calculation creativity 90? Okay complexity 80. Okay philosophy
[16991.61s -> 16994.36s]  93 93
[16994.36s -> 17001.87s]  Cleanliness 60 90 flat 90 flat cleanliness. Are we are you guys agreeing on that? That's what doug said
[17002.03s -> 17008.08s]  I mean i'm down to lower it. I think it's fair 88 go for it. 88. Is that fair? I can do 88
[17008.16s -> 17012.08s]  I can do 88. Okay, there is no check raid check raid 60. All right, so
[17012.64s -> 17019.29s]  Uh, that puts me at an 84.65. Yeah, I just I guess
[17021.77s -> 17026.41s]  Let me just let me just like sneak my way in here real quick. Oh, sorry dropped your cleanliness to 80 flat
[17027.13s -> 17029.13s]  80 where where am I sit here? Oh
[17030.57s -> 17033.77s]  Right above any right below poke. Honestly, that's pretty fair
[17034.94s -> 17036.92s]  Yeah, middle of the pack
[17036.92s -> 17042.14s]  84.65 that looks all right to me. You're doing an exam and the teacher just takes at the end
[17042.22s -> 17044.22s]  It's like I just better than you
[17044.78s -> 17049.26s]  Yeah, what about my dad still didn't still didn't even do like top five
[17050.30s -> 17053.02s]  That's right. The teacher didn't even get top five
[17053.18s -> 17054.62s]  Oh
[17054.62s -> 17058.25s]  How the hell did you do it so good? Tell me there you're fine
[17059.85s -> 17064.81s]  Well, hey jerma, you know, congratulations. You look like you have some potential in this game. So I would keep at it
[17066.41s -> 17069.37s]  Yeah, that was a lot of fun. Did you guys have a good was that did you guys have a good time?
[17070.49s -> 17074.01s]  I don't know how you guys did what you did in 75 minutes. You guys are amazing
[17074.76s -> 17079.72s]  Yeah, everyone was creative for like their own their own way, you know, that was really awesome. I want to do it again
[17080.28s -> 17082.28s]  My only regrets I didn't get to go earlier
[17082.76s -> 17086.99s]  So I wouldn't have to go after the yeah, I wish I went earlier too
[17090.35s -> 17093.23s]  Do this again we do this again, but we're giving two hours
[17094.11s -> 17097.23s]  Yeah, we can do we could do a two hours
[17097.95s -> 17103.79s]  Hey house flipper two actually they don't have a release date, but you can build your you can build your actual whole house
[17103.79s -> 17109.07s]  I think from scratch in house number two. Oh my god. I also think it's strict a strict. Um
[17110.20s -> 17116.81s]  Like you should be graded on your performance there your what do you presentation like it should be strict five minutes
[17116.89s -> 17122.65s]  Can't go over can't go under get some songs in there. You know, I think that's part of it get some songs in there
[17124.49s -> 17125.61s]  Little music
[17125.61s -> 17130.65s]  Yeah, I just realized something I just realized something this whole thing was a gaslight by jerma
[17130.89s -> 17135.37s]  Because he just took a bunch of people in here to see how they viewed him through a scope
[17135.69s -> 17139.93s]  Like how do you view jerma and it turns out it's you know me
[17140.81s -> 17142.57s]  Just viewing him through memes
[17142.57s -> 17148.27s]  But other people are thinking like how do I skew it towards jerma through creativity or whatever, you know
[17148.35s -> 17151.55s]  and i'm just saying i'm just saying I think this was a
[17152.57s -> 17155.87s]  Experiment for jerma to do it. I don't know. They just feel I mean it was
[17156.67s -> 17158.67s]  It was this was an experiment
[17158.91s -> 17161.80s]  That that is absolutely correct. None of you won anything
[17162.60s -> 17168.84s]  And we're all going to go about our day normally as well. Yeah, then nobody 100 grand looking at this. Yeah the candy bar
[17169.80s -> 17173.48s]  I'll be waiting for the check in the mail the candy bar 100 grand scale right here
[17173.88s -> 17178.89s]  This is some ig in scoring for sure. You know, you should advertise it like 10 million dollars next time
[17178.89s -> 17182.89s]  But it's all inside joke. We don't talk about that. Do it for like five million dollars
[17183.68s -> 17189.82s]  Yeah, well, I honestly this was actually an experiment. Hope you guys had a good time. I thought it was great
[17189.82s -> 17195.66s]  I thought everyone had everyone had a lot of funny shit. Um, I thank you for organizing it
[17196.14s -> 17198.30s]  Yeah, I thank you so much
[17198.94s -> 17205.82s]  Everybody's the one person by point one points. I would be oh my god. I'm I'm honestly shocked. I'm honestly shocked
[17206.14s -> 17207.90s]  Are you guys the great? I?
[17207.90s -> 17211.58s]  Forget it. Like I said in the very beginning all these grades. They just horse shit. It's just for fun
[17211.66s -> 17214.14s]  So i'm i'm glad everybody had a good time. I know i know don't worry
[17214.64s -> 17218.80s]  We spent like 20 minutes grading your crusty crab like number by number
[17219.28s -> 17222.80s]  If it doesn't mean anything, I mean I've I would have probably given myself like a 96
[17223.20s -> 17229.58s]  Well, thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you guys honors each shake get rolled. Um, it was a pleasure
[17230.30s -> 17232.00s]  Yeah
[17232.00s -> 17234.00s]  All right. Take it easy guys. Thanks for sticking around
[17236.64s -> 17246.06s]  Thank you, bye bye thanks also the mods too the mods helped facilitate a lot of this so thanks mods. All right
[17246.96s -> 17249.71s]  Uh, that was really interesting
[17250.40s -> 17252.40s]  Uh, I think I had a lot of fun
[17252.56s -> 17254.08s]  Hopefully everybody else did
[17254.08s -> 17256.32s]  Technically speaking. I think it yeah
[17256.32s -> 17258.96s]  Maybe we could drop the amount that people can do a tour
[17259.36s -> 17262.56s]  Because some people was like eight minutes then it was like 15 6 12
[17262.64s -> 17266.52s]  I think we could probably make it so it's like you get 12 minutes and that's it but
[17267.08s -> 17270.30s]  Um, I had a blast. That was a lot of fun. If you guys liked it
[17270.38s -> 17273.96s]  I would love to do another one get some other streamers to get some more people involved
[17275.87s -> 17283.74s]  So just about at like the four and a half five hour mark right now. So I think that's good. Sounds good
[17285.68s -> 17289.55s]  I don't mind having no limits. Yeah, I mean it it
[17290.36s -> 17294.12s]  I wanted to give people the room to kind of just kind of go and meme and do whatever they wanted
[17294.52s -> 17300.04s]  So but yeah, I mean the the screen sharing was the technical stuff through it looked pretty good. I
[17300.52s -> 17304.76s]  Uh, the only thing is jolts looked like kind of that kind of chunky playstation 1
[17304.76s -> 17307.88s]  But the good part is you could watch it on jolts stream, too
[17307.96s -> 17311.80s]  So that was part of it to make sure that you could see a high quality version, but it was awesome
[17312.12s -> 17319.47s]  Jolts was great. I loved it. Um, yeah, I I would love to do this again. Thanks everybody for watching
[17320.19s -> 17323.07s]  See you soon. Uh, that's it for me. That's really all I had planned
[17323.84s -> 17329.18s]  I if is anybody else gonna stick around and stream that was there if they are we can throw a raid to them
[17329.18s -> 17339.26s]  If people are still reading, I mean if people are still streaming. Yeah, that was fun
[17340.32s -> 17342.32s]  Yeah, thanks everybody that participated. I know
[17342.80s -> 17346.08s]  Uh kind of taking a like a four or five hour chunk out of your day
[17346.81s -> 17350.81s]  To kind of hang out for a while is it's a lot to ask but I appreciate it everybody that was there
[17355.16s -> 17360.92s]  Raid the winner. That's actually a good idea. That's funny highest grade gets the raid
[17361.40s -> 17366.54s]  Or should we split it between three people is uh, so
[17367.18s -> 17369.80s]  Um doug doug
[17369.80s -> 17371.23s]  rt
[17371.23s -> 17377.98s]  And italics are the top three rt has our rt is ending of the top three who is not ending
[17378.14s -> 17388.70s]  He said rt is ending is doug doug still streaming is italics still streaming because italics technically was in second place
[17394.38s -> 17396.38s]  You should raid the loser instead
[17399.00s -> 17416.11s]  No, connor's house was fucking funny. It was great. All right, uh, is italics still planning on streaming as I do this
[17416.19s -> 17421.23s]  Let me do that. Let me put the actual shit up here now
[17421.95s -> 17423.23s]  Yeah, there we go
[17423.23s -> 17435.52s]  Let me ask him. Let's see if he's still going turn this down for just a second. I'll back in here
[17436.73s -> 17441.26s]  Uh italics are you here?
[17441.26s -> 17443.42s]  He is deafened and muted
[17443.98s -> 17452.99s]  The talics is not streaming anymore. It's how presenting. All right, so doug doug is the third up. So italics is ending
[17454.35s -> 17459.71s]  So go say hi to your number three your top of the class doug doug with his unbelievable
