[29.11s -> 48.41s]  Yeah, sorry, I'm a little late. But I was in pre-stream chat, and oh, did I get his turn stream off?
[48.41s -> 55.70s]  Nope. Okay, I gotta get in a better habit of doing this. So when I press turn stream on, go live,
[55.70s -> 64.18s]  right? It's a button you press on OBS. I press it, and then just move my hand off the mouse.
[64.66s -> 71.00s]  So it's like, go live, it's still hovering over it. And sometimes I'm talking with my hands right
[71.00s -> 74.84s]  now. Just, oh, hey, everybody, how you doing? Move my hands around. And if I press the space bar,
[74.84s -> 93.03s]  the stream will turn off. It's happened once or twice before. Oops. No, we're good. How you doing?
[93.03s -> 97.61s]  Hope your night's going well. Hope your day is going well. Hope your weekend has been okay.
[98.41s -> 110.42s]  That's been pretty good. We're going to try to finish the eternal cylinder tonight. I know
[111.22s -> 118.49s]  that there is potentially another three to five hours, depending on how many, you know,
[118.49s -> 129.32s]  sauce rants I go on tonight. I think we'll finish tonight. I think we'll get through it. Three to
[129.32s -> 142.25s]  five, about four to four and a half. We'll see. You should eat leaves on stream. Lettuce, I've done
[142.25s -> 151.21s]  that already. I already did that. Do you guys not remember? I don't know. Maybe you don't.
[155.62s -> 160.66s]  One time I just ate. When was that? That was like last year. I grabbed like as big a handful of
[160.66s -> 166.74s]  spinach or lettuce as I possibly could fit in my mouth and just didn't say anything. I did that.
[166.74s -> 170.66s]  I've done that like probably three times. I've done that. I've done that joke like three times.
[174.97s -> 187.34s]  At this point, is it even a joke or is it? I don't know. Not really. I do have tea and I do
[187.34s -> 194.26s]  appreciate the people telling me to take the tea bags out because I only got another minute before
[194.26s -> 207.91s]  I need to take them out. Different tea today. This is a peach tea. Oh, hold on. I think it's
[207.91s -> 223.93s]  got hibiscus in it. Is that good for you? Hibiscus, rose. I think there's rose in this. Is that good?
[223.93s -> 234.86s]  Do you put anything in your tea? No. I drink my tea with zero sugar, zero honey. I'm one of those
[234.86s -> 242.42s]  weirdos. Try peppermint tea. I actually really like peppermint tea, but it makes me go to the bathroom.
[243.32s -> 254.02s]  So not a great stream tea, I will say. You know, I don't want to drink a big peppermint tea
[254.74s -> 258.18s]  because in 30, 40 minutes I'll be like, ah, see you later. I'll be back.
[258.82s -> 268.60s]  It was during the later alligator stream. I feel like I did it during a multiverse. No, that was
[268.60s -> 278.31s]  carrots. I don't remember. But anyways, are you guys ready? Let's not waste any time.
[278.31s -> 283.91s]  I'm going to get right to it. I feel like during a multiverse stream, I did it.
[289.64s -> 306.23s]  Carrots and lettuce. Why do you delete tweets after the stream? Well, because,
[307.27s -> 312.39s]  so here's the problem is I don't really use Twitter that often. I don't know. I only use it to
[312.39s -> 321.85s]  tweet out streams. My Twitter would just be links to the stream. If you went to my timeline, it would
[321.85s -> 334.36s]  just be a thousand links to my stream. It'd be awful. And also too, when the stream is over,
[334.36s -> 340.36s]  I don't want to have, since somebody's timeline be, oh, he's live. Cool. I'm going to join. And
[340.36s -> 355.18s]  I'm just not. So it's just temporary. Stop talking. I want to see Gunu. I do too. Yeah,
[355.18s -> 382.70s]  shut this guy up. Let's go. Where did we leave off? I don't remember. Oh, that's right. We got to
[382.70s -> 392.57s]  this new world. We got to the new area. We're in part three. What was the last thing we had to do?
[393.13s -> 398.46s]  There you go. Somewhere out there waited an elder who did not know of his sibling's fate.
[398.46s -> 405.27s]  And the Trebum felt the weight of the bad news. Okay. So he's going to go to the temple. I,
[405.27s -> 410.23s]  one thing about this game I really do appreciate is this thing. The, hey, here are the two points
[410.23s -> 427.88s]  of intro. Oh, I, okay. We have to go over there. Don't care. Switch to Gunu. Gunu? Where's Gunu?
[431.06s -> 444.92s]  Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Clap. Okay. So I have to go this way, but let me go over here
[444.92s -> 458.26s]  first. You just sounded like a dog. Wait, we need to eat. Who's got food? You do? No, you do.
[458.82s -> 475.42s]  Who needs food? Don't just throw the stakes away. What are you crazy? Stop that. We need those. How
[475.42s -> 491.18s]  did I only get one? Who's taking all the stakes? You. Can we get a recap? Um, okay. We're kind of
[491.18s -> 497.30s]  at the, we're near the, I think, the final arc of the game. So give me a second. All right.
[497.30s -> 505.50s]  There are these creatures and they are called Trevums. And that's what we have here. They are
[506.84s -> 513.38s]  little magical creatures that can, you know, just go watch the intro cinematic on YouTube.
[514.34s -> 517.94s]  It's probably two minutes. It's going to take me eight minutes of just stumbling around,
[517.94s -> 524.17s]  slowly talking to explain it. You know what I mean? In the, in the amount of time of me going.
[524.97s -> 533.83s]  So it's these creatures that during the journey you, you could have already watched the opening
[533.83s -> 547.22s]  cinematic. That's a cop out. That's fine. Here. How about this? Run away from the giant rolling pin
[547.22s -> 554.76s]  that is crushing all civilization. There you go. I think that's accurate. Oh, this is a, this is a
[554.76s -> 568.79s]  cloud. I think we're good. Yeah. I don't think we need to do anything here. I have a lot of
[568.79s -> 581.27s]  crystals. I got to use them. The real question is, all right, it's under there. That's a new enemy.
[581.27s -> 611.05s]  What was that? What just happened? Who's the DPS? All right. The okay. Uh, the DPS is
[612.18s -> 624.90s]  this guy right here. He has a stomp. Can I not do it? Sorry. This guy has a stomp. This guy also can,
[624.90s -> 631.93s]  uh, can take, um, bombs from this one. So this is like a damage support and I'm the one that
[631.93s -> 641.18s]  actually shoots the bombs. I think that's the only DPS I have and it's not even DPS. It's just
[641.18s -> 664.49s]  anybody can be anything. For instance, check this out. I missed everybody run. I would have
[664.49s -> 668.17s]  gotten booted from red right there. All right. We have to go down because this thing's going to
[668.17s -> 677.56s]  shoot us. Sick gameplay. It went right through his legs. That's not my fault. Can we make it?
[678.20s -> 701.93s]  I wonder if I can just make it. What's going on? Did I make it? This is bad. Oh, get up here. Get
[701.93s -> 708.87s]  up here. Some of you get up here before he breathes poison on us. All right. Go, go. What are you
[708.87s -> 720.79s]  doing? Ooh, I like that. Okay. Well, don't touch it. Don't touch it. What are you doing?
[721.51s -> 728.82s]  Why are they standing on it? Did anyone else hear from Australia? Why is Derma playing with
[728.82s -> 738.98s]  outback animals? You know, I thought, Oh my God, my T, why didn't anybody tell me it's been sitting
[738.98s -> 751.75s]  for like 15 minutes? Shit. Oh, hold on. Oh, I told you guys to tell me it was one minute.
[751.75s -> 758.42s]  The tannin is going to be bad. We'll find out. How long has the stream been on for? 13 minutes.
[758.42s -> 770.57s]  Shit. It means it's been there for at least 15. God damn it. Whatever. I think it's all right.
[770.57s -> 782.39s]  Oh, tastes pretty good. I think we're dying in here. What an inhospitable place this was.
[782.39s -> 788.02s]  The air was suffocating and the heat was almost unbearable. Oh shit. The trebum would have to
[788.02s -> 794.42s]  make good use of their abilities to overcome the obstacles before them. Okay. Um, but who would
[794.42s -> 799.78s]  choose to actually live here? All right. We actually have to move now. Terrible things.
[799.78s -> 807.02s]  They must have endured in the outside world. No, this is not fireproof. I don't think this is
[807.02s -> 822.71s]  fireproof. Is there anything fireproof in here? Is this water hot? This is hot. Everybody get in
[822.71s -> 835.72s]  the water. I can't tell. I think I just have to go fast. Do I have any? Hold on. Really important.
[835.72s -> 848.95s]  Do I actually have any healing? I don't have zero healing and there's nothing I can do about this.
[848.95s -> 854.39s]  Oh shit. Hold on. Somebody don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't
[855.11s -> 865.06s]  We're fine. Is this it? Fire resistant bark? Okay. Um, we're gonna eat this right now.
[865.06s -> 877.05s]  Uh, Gino's gonna eat this. Who's gonna eat this? I wonder if only one can eat it. I'm gonna give it
[877.05s -> 897.29s]  to Vu. Where's Vu? Vu, where are you? Vu, where are you? Oh, did it work? Did it work? It worked.
[897.29s -> 903.54s]  Oh thank god. Okay. I got fire resist. Now I also have a permanent mutation I can do. Thank goodness.
[903.54s -> 920.86s]  Where is it? Where was it? It was the thing with the tongue. It looked like the tongue. What the
[920.86s -> 932.58s]  heck is it? Where is it? Oh there it is. Okay I need three crystals and I can get this permanently.
[932.58s -> 941.61s]  So who has it? Didn't I keep three? I'll get it eventually. Okay. Oh I do have it. Why is it
[941.61s -> 957.70s]  showing up as I don't? Huh? That's weird. Somebody in the oh it's probably somebody in the in the
[957.70s -> 967.85s]  cloud. All right. We're safe. We're good. Everybody eat up. Very cool. I'm very happy about this.
[967.85s -> 976.76s]  I would say that's pretty sick. Oh I actually have a cool announcement to make. Um, pretty pretty
[976.76s -> 982.41s]  cool stuff. Those of you that were big fans of the Elden Ring streams with, uh, Stir and I.
[984.10s -> 992.68s]  This coming weekend we're gonna do it again. More mods. More mayhem. At least for one more day.
[992.68s -> 1002.73s]  So that should be fun. I don't want to take too much of this shit because it is. It is shit. Let's
[1002.73s -> 1013.43s]  be honest. All right. There's an elder down here somewhere. Let me pay attention for a second.
[1013.43s -> 1041.40s]  Crystals. Where's my crystal eater? They all look really cool. They have scales now. He really wanted
[1041.40s -> 1047.14s]  to announce that on his stream but I mean I'm just gonna. He was like I have a huge thing planned.
[1047.14s -> 1050.26s]  I'm gonna do a huge announcement for it and I'm like oh cool cool cool and then I'm just doing it.
[1055.90s -> 1075.03s]  Oh did I miss a way to go up? Terrible friend. I'm I'm just kidding. Whoa hold on. Ooh this kind
[1075.03s -> 1117.80s]  of hurts my eyes. Does this burn if I touch it? Is it? Oh won't lose anybody Andy. Well it said
[1117.80s -> 1124.60s]  that fireproof skin. I'm like okay so what does that mean? The hypothesis. Come on.
[1125.56s -> 1129.56s]  To make good use of their abilities to overcome the obstacles before them.
[1129.56s -> 1139.69s]  All right where's the voodoo? But who would choose to actually live here? Terrible things
[1139.69s -> 1146.39s]  they must have endured. Resistance not proof. Yeah but I don't know how. Resist high. I don't know
[1146.39s -> 1151.80s]  what the game was trying to do. Who knows? Some games it's like yeah you're immune to fire damage
[1151.80s -> 1160.20s]  or you take like 100% less fire. Whatever 90% less fire damage. Yeah at what point does fire
[1160.20s -> 1168.36s]  resist become fire immunity? If I wear 500 fire resistant t-shirts can I go into the lava? At what
[1168.36s -> 1178.14s]  point is it immunity? If I get into a fire resistant space suit can I and it's airtight
[1178.14s -> 1192.81s]  can I can I dunk into lava? Anyways who made the first sauce? Anybody know? Okay let's try this
[1192.81s -> 1207.59s]  again. I'm not saying I'm gonna dunk it. I'm talking about video game logic. I actually need
[1207.59s -> 1223.46s]  three of these right now. So this is permanent mutation for um the fire trunk. Should I just put it on
[1223.46s -> 1236.98s]  everybody? Why not? Well maybe not. I don't need it right now. All right we're gonna have to get
[1236.98s -> 1276.68s]  these off the wall. Hold on. Where's my uh p-expert? Is this the p-expert? Is this the p-expert? No it's
[1276.68s -> 1287.74s]  not. Who is the who is the p-expert? I know I have one. Did I did I get removed? It might have gotten
[1287.74s -> 1316.50s]  removed. I really fucking want those. I'm such like a crystal fiend. I need it. Watch out. Ah whatever.
[1316.50s -> 1337.98s]  Can't get them all. I want those extra ones. Whatever. Just move on. I know but I want them.
[1337.98s -> 1347.61s]  Wait a minute nobody go near this. Don't I did you hear what I just said? Why would you? Well you
[1347.61s -> 1373.83s]  can't hear me but why did you do that? What's going on? Okay um what's get out of the get out
[1373.83s -> 1383.22s]  of the light get out of the light get out of the light. This is new. Uh you lost a power. Shit it's
[1383.22s -> 1397.03s]  okay. You take this thing. I don't know what this is but go for it. Perceptive eyes to see light
[1397.03s -> 1405.51s]  frequencies that otherwise cannot be perceived which may reveal important secrets. All right
[1405.51s -> 1413.86s]  here's what I'm thinking glow in the dark glow in the dark eyes jump legs horn snout. Now that's
[1413.86s -> 1420.74s]  gonna be pretty cool looking. Okay perceptive eyes. I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
[1420.74s -> 1442.62s]  Open this somehow with our perceptive eyes. Can we move this? Oh I'm gonna take another one.
[1442.62s -> 1462.55s]  I'm probably gonna need it later. Okay what is that? I don't understand what that's trying to
[1462.55s -> 1486.84s]  tell me. Like don't touch that. How do I get through here? Can I break this? I can't go
[1486.84s -> 1503.88s]  through here. Okay I'm just gonna I'm gonna go try not to touch it. Whoa wait a minute. What is
[1504.52s -> 1515.62s]  what is this? What did I do? I guess I turned it off because I went close to it. I can't.
[1517.83s -> 1533.75s]  Stop. Oh my god. Where's my oh my god. What a fucking disaster. I don't know what it wants
[1533.75s -> 1550.02s]  me to do. Okay I went close to it so it stops but who gives a shit. How do I I just don't get it.
[1550.02s -> 1559.66s]  I don't know what it's even asking me to do. I'm going back. You can pass but who cares. I
[1559.74s -> 1568.01s]  could pass before. Just I don't I don't understand what the game like wants me to
[1568.01s -> 1574.47s]  do with this information. What an inhospitable place this was. The air was suffocating and the
[1574.47s -> 1580.79s]  heat was almost unbearable. The trebum would have to make good use of their abilities to overcome
[1580.79s -> 1584.39s]  the obstacles. Like was the only point to get in here and just get the eyes and then leave? Who
[1584.39s -> 1599.32s]  would choose to actually live here? Terrible things they must have endured in the outside world.
[1599.32s -> 1607.40s]  Dead run. I think that's my least I think that's the part of the game that I don't like the most
[1607.40s -> 1615.35s]  is like the hey the light takes away all your powers haha don't give me powers to take them away
[1615.35s -> 1621.82s]  that's that's nobody likes that don't give me powers that are cool just to take them from me
[1621.82s -> 1643.96s]  not cool haha okay let's try this again uh wait first of all I need these crystals gonna reset
[1643.96s -> 1667.80s]  here got that okay were there any weren't the crystals hanging out over here so I can go
[1667.80s -> 1686.73s]  over here don't go in the lava let's try this bullshit again I cannot save in a cave it's only
[1686.73s -> 1729.34s]  at the beginning of the cave this again okay good mm-hmm so let's rethink this whole process
[1729.34s -> 1736.50s]  again I wish I could just tell them to all stay like I can I could just investigate with somebody
[1736.50s -> 1746.02s]  so the story here is I have to go across this I have to go in here and scare it okay then everybody
[1746.02s -> 1760.02s]  goes everybody go they lag behind okay everybody come on all right here we are I get this new
[1760.02s -> 1783.86s]  mutation which is just perceptive eyes I give it to you so where should I go do I have to go
[1783.86s -> 1790.07s]  into the lava now and jump around I wonder what game progress is here what do I just leave this
[1790.07s -> 1795.37s]  was a pretty major temple wasn't it there's definitely something else to do here okay I'm
[1795.37s -> 1831.06s]  stuck on the fucking wall okay everybody's happy everybody got out crying I'm leaving I I want
[1831.06s -> 1849.48s]  them so bad but I don't care okay so what's out here let me get a few more of these press B oh

[2085.86s -> 2108.26s]  one in the wall okay I can burn that but I'm afraid that someone's just gonna walk in the fire
[2108.26s -> 2112.50s]  you know I'm gonna walk down there with the person to do the ignite and two people are gonna die in
[2112.50s -> 2122.28s]  lava just reload if they burn that's 23 minutes ago if somebody dies they kind of have to just die
[2122.28s -> 2148.26s]  I can't tell them to stay here okay do not follow me do not follow me don't follow me oh my god this

[2440.30s -> 2447.10s]  see what you're saying like I don't need to touch these it made a sound when I did that though
[2447.10s -> 2468.98s]  okay there's nothing here um who had that power before you stand on the other button I hate that
[2468.98s -> 2473.86s]  mechanic I hate the delete the power button you spend so much time trying to get your guys good
[2473.86s -> 2478.52s]  to go and then this is just a thing in the game that just removes it that's annoying I hate it
[2478.52s -> 2502.01s]  okay I stepped on them both okay could you please stop doing that oh my god I didn't even do
[2502.01s -> 2514.26s]  anything I mean they just what else am I supposed to do it didn't go all the way down you gotta be
[2514.26s -> 2546.30s]  fucking kidding me so you just we just all have to lose our powers now lame lame lame that's lame
[2546.30s -> 2558.90s]  that's lame stop taking stuff from me that's lame now half of you now now I don't even know
[2558.98s -> 2588.97s]  who the fuck had what and now I don't know what's missing from them lame just over there I get the
[2588.97s -> 2594.42s]  whole this permanent upgrades now but I don't know I kind of it's hard to keep track of who has what
[2594.42s -> 2604.95s]  and if I know you're like the dinosaur one that has the don't get up here get up here I heard him
[2604.95s -> 2614.78s]  splash I just heard a splash okay he's alive like I know you as the dinosaur with the long spit
[2614.78s -> 2620.23s]  right if it I don't know it gets it gets confusing because now I don't know who had what and now I
[2620.23s -> 2634.97s]  don't know what I'm missing the elder saw sadness in the trebum's eyes and gave them words of do
[2634.97s -> 2643.45s]  not mourn for me and my brother I wish only that my end had been like his for when we act in the
[2643.45s -> 2651.80s]  service of others we become greater than ourselves without losing who we are I was afraid and stayed
[2651.88s -> 2661.56s]  behind and I am lesser for it but I can feel the tremors in this cave and I know soon my brother
[2661.56s -> 2668.44s]  this does not look like me I've seen like 10 of you say that let me help you while I can you are
[2668.44s -> 2675.37s]  here to learn about the great lenders that power a trebum palace wander in the desert looking for
[2675.37s -> 2682.49s]  the brightest glare you can find follow the glare until you find a great structure made of glass
[2683.26s -> 2689.42s]  you may have encountered one already but to activate them you will need a special mutation
[2690.15s -> 2698.31s]  the key to this mutation is held by the great gar gar three lenses is all you need and there
[2698.31s -> 2707.11s]  are many left follow the glares find the gar and you will succeed it is a task fit for the great
[2707.11s -> 2717.38s]  heroes of old but who says that ordinary little trebum can't be heroes we're junior heroes
[2731.19s -> 2740.20s]  uh I want that so bad but somebody's gonna die you know it somebody jumped off who just jumped
[2740.20s -> 2758.15s]  off look at all that down there please don't do that I'm not telling him to do that there's a
[2758.15s -> 2769.56s]  chest there's a button uh oh what if I lose somebody it's gonna be so he's stupid that was
[2769.56s -> 2774.81s]  just he's dead and now he's not coming back I'm sorry guys that's how it works I didn't do
[2774.81s -> 2782.31s]  anything he was really dumb and then we're just sorry but you I don't know what you were thinking
[2782.31s -> 2787.99s]  you just walked off the edge and that is exactly what I was afraid of so um they just walk off
[2787.99s -> 2801.86s]  sometimes and you're gone so before that happens again I'm going to get out of here what's the
[2801.86s -> 2807.74s]  safest way to get out of here so nobody falls off the edge I can't save the game the game
[2807.74s -> 2817.37s]  cannot be saved indoors do I have to like jump out of here how do I get the fuck out of here
[2817.37s -> 2832.94s]  without anybody dying please have nobody fallen we lost uh we lost I liked gua too that's sad
[2835.02s -> 2844.94s]  okay there's nothing that can be done I'm not no we're not reloading do you see I'm not going
[2844.94s -> 2860.86s]  back 36 minutes where is dead I'm sorry everybody but it's just the way it is dude you sorry you
[2860.86s -> 2872.39s]  talked about sauce for 36 minutes I didn't stop I hate that feature of this game it's maddening
[2872.39s -> 2885.96s]  it's infuriating to me okay so let's get out of here this was the way up to the elder so we're
[2885.96s -> 2895.37s]  gonna go back this way I'm sorry gua we can revive them though I have 25 crystals or something I have
[2895.37s -> 2913.99s]  a lot I get out of here this way is it this way how do I get the hell out of here do I still have
[2913.99s -> 2931.24s]  the fire move or did that get deleted in the in the fun light did it get removed it got deleted
[2931.24s -> 2979.24s]  in the fun light um hold on nobody just fell in right did not tempt me to go this way well if
[2979.24s -> 2999.70s]  nobody follows me I think I can do this as long as nobody follows I don't think they're following
[2999.70s -> 3048.41s]  the way I had all the crystals on them no okay all right dungeon sucks and balls it's not my
[3048.41s -> 3064.76s]  favorite I will say but I gotta go all the way because there's a there's a chest at the end
[3064.76s -> 3081.42s]  of this and a bunch of crystals I want it I like this part this particle I don't mind this part
[3081.42s -> 3095.34s]  because I get a cool reward look at all these crunchies why am I dying I am dying can I even
[3095.34s -> 3139.51s]  make this jump oh no too far away nice what's in this chest it better be good uh-huh yeah it's
[3139.51s -> 3153.69s]  worth it I gotta do some consolidation I have a lot of these powers I just don't I don't know what
[3153.69s -> 3157.77s]  to do with them all I'm afraid to get rid of anything because the permanent upgrade system
[3157.85s -> 3164.82s]  you need to have it in your inventory so I kind of just kind of stuck in a position where everybody
[3164.82s -> 3172.86s]  has a full inventory of power-ups that I probably need eventually to upgrade in the permanent tree
[3172.86s -> 3192.57s]  I wish there was a chest or something hmm I think that's it get the big guy upgrade and store him
[3192.57s -> 3199.22s]  in the cloud I probably would want to do two I think I'm gonna do two or three big upgrades
[3199.22s -> 3213.69s]  and then just store them it's probably the play there's a gem right there oh man it's sticking
[3213.69s -> 3231.42s]  out of here all right cool let's go back what is that over there do you see that thing what is
[3231.42s -> 3241.40s]  that what's that mean what is that why is that there what is that what is this what is that
[3241.40s -> 3270.26s]  what is that what is this all right I have 30 crystals we need an upgrade center right now bad
[3270.26s -> 3305.64s]  do the eyes nothing here I think we're good this is the exit that's where I want to go you need
[3305.64s -> 3323.78s]  to look with your special eyes okay unfortunately we lost someone sad we did that's the nature of
[3323.78s -> 3335.82s]  the tre bombs we have to continue our mission I can pull somebody out which I'm going to because
[3335.82s -> 3339.98s]  that's probably the only opportunity I'm gonna have for a little bit let's go pull somebody out
[3339.98s -> 3356.26s]  actually there's some crystals I want here here you I'm gonna have like 35 crystals what was his
[3356.26s -> 3376.50s]  name the person that died um where that was an easy one it's just go ahead come on go ahead come
[3376.50s -> 3390.10s]  on where I'll pull somebody out I could revive go ahead but I feel like there's already people here
[3390.10s -> 3405.37s]  no I'll pull a glare I can pull groutemo out we'll pull groutemo out all right it's movement time
[3405.37s -> 3413.53s]  let's eat and we're moving wait this is the first move in the whole time we've been live tonight
[3413.53s -> 3428.39s]  are you guys ready okay here we go uh always grapple grapple where you are I need yeah grapple
[3428.39s -> 3443.21s]  who has water one of you has it I know you do nobody has water okay all right let's go
[3444.22s -> 3469.91s]  oh I'm such a piece of shit I'm such a piece of shit and I don't even care uh I do need to eat
[3469.91s -> 3486.84s]  you've got the food no who has it no stop don't it's gonna do it again just everything is so

[3635.06s -> 3661.85s]  look like there was a safe place to do it but we've eaten okay um let's go I think that cube is
[3661.85s -> 3703.96s]  moving what are you doing get out of the fucking water all right we're good I think that the thing
[3703.96s -> 3730.54s]  I'm supposed to find is right here yeah there it is gah who's going to communicate with it first
[3742.79s -> 3756.12s]  oh not this I gotta okay this is gonna be incredibly dangerous it's gonna have to be who

[3767.42s -> 3786.92s]  wewam we gotta make bombs over here you have to shoot it off with the water but I need to be
[3786.92s -> 3797.02s]  prepared save the game I think I think it autosaved when I got through the uh the gate
[3797.02s -> 3807.13s]  three bombs enough or should it be more probably more is everybody on health I think everything's
[3807.13s -> 3824.76s]  fine right yeah okay good luck everybody if somebody dies then I'll just reload
[3842.23s -> 3878.12s]  true and based okay here we go oh what's wrong are you okay what just what the fuck did you just get

[4133.78s -> 4147.62s]  temple so I can take some inventory or what the hell I even have I wonder if this does anything
[4147.62s -> 4155.46s]  is this just a ignite them and run around and kill stuff or will this blow up this um dome I don't
[4155.46s -> 4164.33s]  know what the end game on this is you weren't even close he wasn't even close he wasn't even
[4164.33s -> 4171.53s]  close to the explosion he wasn't even close what what excuse huh it wasn't even close

[4247.80s -> 4288.63s]  person somebody else take these I don't want them all right let's do it crystals crystals crystals
[4288.63s -> 4307.72s]  crystals all right now we wait how come this how is the no dance button that's kind of unfortunate
[4307.72s -> 4317.02s]  I think how come I can't press like up on the d-pad and have them wiggle wiggle wiggle that's a major
[4317.02s -> 4340.26s]  major um misstep there yeah I get every crystal I know people probably sitting there going like dude
[4340.26s -> 4362.54s]  you don't yes you do important for me to get them all look at all this I'm gonna have like 50 crystals
[4362.54s -> 4380.09s]  I need a temple so bad oh my goodness okay he's penny pinching no I'm collecting money
[4380.09s -> 4415.37s]  why's there scary music all right there's some interesting shit in here all right well this
[4415.37s -> 4422.22s]  well this cooks in here um who's got an empty inventory does anybody have an empty inventory
[4422.22s -> 4449.43s]  any of you woogwool get over here what are you doing up here woogwool is really cute I like
[4450.07s -> 4474.18s]  okay this full heal or half heal and this is all right uh I need you suck up yeah we're just gonna
[4474.18s -> 4478.28s]  chill here for a minute there's too many of these I guess I could pick them up with some other people
[4478.28s -> 4485.13s]  but everybody has a full inventory we need to spend 10 to 20 minutes just getting rid of all
[4485.13s -> 4492.17s]  these items just storing somebody with like the big um the big thing it's like there I like there's
[4492.17s -> 4499.18s]  so many items that they need to hold on to but there's no way to reliably hold on to them the
[4499.26s -> 4505.34s]  game has this feature where hold on to items and permanent do permanent stuff but fill your whole
[4505.34s -> 4526.98s]  fucking inventory permanently you're being greedy I don't think I mean if I okay if I go to one of
[4526.98s -> 4533.06s]  these elders and they're like oh all right here's the recipe for the long tail and like I don't have
[4533.06s -> 4539.67s]  this and like I have to go find this again I have it right now I've got to go find another long tail
[4539.67s -> 4558.02s]  what if I don't find one okay hold on almost done you are fomo-ing yourself
[4566.97s -> 4597.75s]  only a few more crystals and then we can leave 50 crystals this is ridiculous all right so let me
[4597.75s -> 4612.52s]  see I need oh my god I didn't know I need I had three of those already fuck I had one of those
[4612.52s -> 4626.31s]  I don't know man I kind of don't even care about any of this uh okay I needed four of those and
[4626.31s -> 4635.90s]  four bug things I think I can get those now pretty sure I have those don't I
[4635.90s -> 4649.90s]  two bugs I need uh I need four of these those some of these are outside and then water kind
[4649.90s -> 4667.54s]  of cactus things okay Gunu where are you let's go I have somebody that has do I still have somebody
[4667.54s -> 4683.14s]  that has the eyes oh hold on I can't control anybody I have to leave this cave okay where's
[4683.14s -> 4714.57s]  the person that has the eyes oh for the love fucking god please okay hi maybe I can't can't
[4714.57s -> 4720.36s]  use it are they different eyes are those the monster ones where you look at the wrong eyes
[4720.36s -> 4728.73s]  don't you have it though do I have to be selecting the person that currently has it
[4731.13s -> 4774.33s]  oh okay okay I need like six of these I'd run away okay what does it take to make that I need
[4774.33s -> 4801.93s]  four bugs that's up there all right I need to look for the bugs now mm-hmm need two of these
[4801.93s -> 4811.16s]  don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't all right this game like one okay
[4811.16s -> 4817.66s]  I have a complaint I have a complaint time to complain this game wants you to like explore
[4817.66s -> 4825.58s]  and like pick up items but also kill you at every fucking turn if the game wants you to it's like
[4825.58s -> 4831.67s]  two it's like an oxymoron the game like oh go searching for these items and watch out die
[4835.69s -> 4865.00s]  everything kills you where is it risk and reward but I get I get it but it doesn't mean it's not
[4865.00s -> 4878.09s]  frustrating all the time and why am I stuck okay so I have that permanent upgrade that is it's not
[4878.09s -> 4884.54s]  like Elden Ring and Elden Ring I can dodge around that guy and kill him very easily I have offense
[4884.54s -> 4893.14s]  in Elden Ring your trebum's just fucking get rolled over and die I can spit these little
[4893.14s -> 4903.99s]  bombs and shit but it doesn't fucking do anything no more complaining uh this is pretty useful
[4903.99s -> 4930.89s]  we'll give it to Gunnu all right I've gotten some good shit are there any other upgrades that I can
[4930.89s -> 4937.86s]  get here just so I can clean it clean up my inventory I do there's a cheese one I'm gonna
[4937.86s -> 4946.74s]  let's do this now let's just get let's get through this I don't think I can find those here
[4949.10s -> 4958.42s]  I can get oh my goodness okay well I'm gonna uh I had I just didn't know I had this already
[4958.42s -> 4991.24s]  I'll keep this one tracked I need two more of these stupid crystals all right let's go that
[4991.24s -> 5018.33s]  there were some in that hole hmm I need to upgrade so bad let's do that first I've got
[5018.41s -> 5029.85s]  so many of these are you still enjoying it I am but I'm starting to see through the cracks a
[5029.85s -> 5037.06s]  little I definitely want to finish it because I think it's a really interesting fun game
[5037.06s -> 5055.40s]  but I am definitely I'm definitely sniffing out the cracks here no I'm I'm you know what I mean I
[5055.40s -> 5075.08s]  I'm I'm just let let me cook right come on guys let me cook I know I don't hate it I don't
[5075.08s -> 5094.46s]  I just look at how many I could upgrade a million fucking times okay absolutely doing stamina will
[5094.46s -> 5109.40s]  that's completely good but probably food and leadership uh-huh leadership twice let's go crazy
[5109.40s -> 5140.60s]  and then we'll do food we're sure to maybe help food probably okay I'm gonna save the rest
[5140.60s -> 5151.00s]  leadership and water I actually probably should have done water you're right shit teach me something
[5151.00s -> 5157.40s]  the projection from the pool shared its wisdom with the trebum and showed them how to protect it
[5157.40s -> 5171.70s]  from the evil light of their enemies okay uh I did get another one of these which this was
[5172.50s -> 5183.69s]  somebody already has this what was this oh what was this this was something weird right
[5183.69s -> 5194.84s]  all right crystal time are there any big crystals because that would be pretty big because I could
[5194.84s -> 5229.56s]  upgrade get that one come on no big crystals unfortunate all right well thankfully now I've
[5229.56s -> 5243.62s]  got I can we have 10 trebles now I'm good um I should eat is there any food in here
[5250.76s -> 5285.10s]  who cares I just got out of here all right guys let's go that was scary no no no don't I have to
[5285.10s -> 5290.38s]  move I didn't I don't I just want to hang out with my little trebum friends I don't want to just get
[5290.38s -> 5303.42s]  eaten immediately when I leave where's the next point over there oh shit you need to go to the
[5303.42s -> 5334.74s]  cave I need to eat that's more important nobody attack me I'll be very upset um I want the one
[5334.74s -> 5369.45s]  that can run fast I'm gonna it's gonna isn't it yeah well we go now this is kind of shit egg
[5371.08s -> 5380.49s]  there's an egg how am I supposed to get this egg how would you get this I I don't huh how would
[5380.49s -> 5407.35s]  you get this egg I think I'm just dead yeah this is how are you supposed to get this I don't
[5407.35s -> 5415.45s]  think you can I don't think that I don't think there's enough time there's an incubator right
[5415.45s -> 5423.91s]  there yeah but the thing was already on me I don't think it's possible maybe if I go from this
[5423.91s -> 5433.05s]  direction I still have to go down into the kind of little um like give it though let me try this
[5433.05s -> 5492.71s]  you know just do a straight shot from here what the fuck this is not possible hey Gili we saved

[6391.70s -> 6410.15s]  shining light over here check this out if you see some kind of oasis of water definitely scream
[6410.15s -> 6427.34s]  well you don't have to anymore because I think is this water all right now we got to turn this on
[6427.34s -> 6457.56s]  wow we did it excitement rushed through the trebum as the massive lens came to life and started
[6457.56s -> 6464.68s]  rising into the air they had to get off quickly as staying on top of the majestic construct as it
[6464.68s -> 6472.81s]  rose would be quite dangerous the trebum marveled at the miracle their ancestors had wrought
[6473.29s -> 6478.41s]  was that supposed to kill the incredible things had they built that were now okay everyone's
[6478.41s -> 6488.39s]  all right question for another day for now the trebum had two more lenses to find two more lenses
[6493.22s -> 6511.83s]  huh okay all right I'm invested again where's my fast runner there you are who knew you look so
[6511.91s -> 6533.42s]  different huh interesting can we get up there we need water yeah but look this what is that
[6556.17s -> 6563.35s]  I want whatever's on there use the tornado ability maybe I can
[6579.03s -> 6596.20s]  on the flower why would you tell me to do that whoa what kind of contraption is this shit
[6596.20s -> 6658.44s]  why is it done what get one oh come on oh no move out of the way you dopes yes all right

[6669.22s -> 6691.93s]  cool all right let's move shaking my head all right let's go okay there it is let's cross
[6691.93s -> 6728.01s]  I want we have to fill up before we get out of here why is that thing keep doing that
[6733.02s -> 6756.94s]  oh it's because I smell okay right you're stinky ah interesting bridge um I mean that looks kind of
[6756.94s -> 6792.46s]  cool look at that there's a whole thing down here too dangerous this made it been a mistake
[6793.10s -> 6802.07s]  I can't tell if he hates this game or not I don't hate it we're just kind of at the last
[6802.07s -> 6806.39s]  arc of the game and it's gotten a lot more difficult I would say well difficult is the
[6806.39s -> 6812.78s]  wrong word it's a lot more uh like particular of like things I need and things I don't need
[6823.66s -> 6835.00s]  I actually the world is a 10 out of 10 the creatures the audio the graph everything is
[6835.00s -> 6838.36s]  beautiful everything is wonderfully crafted I like the story it's I think it's cool so far
[6842.55s -> 6847.98s]  I would say the gameplay loop is the only thing that's a little lacking for me
[6851.24s -> 6855.45s]  but I still think it's fun
[6870.02s -> 6883.91s]  okay uh I can't go too far is there an egg there's an incubator right here I don't see an egg
[6886.09s -> 6900.57s]  shit egg no it's on top probably but whatever uh I don't want to run too fast if you've missed
[6900.57s -> 6906.01s]  the last couple of streams I know it's probably very loud but I can't go too far or I'll get
[6906.01s -> 6911.29s]  struck by the purple lightning I have to stay in between the purple lightning and the roller
[6915.06s -> 6961.32s]  goals over there yeah slow down uh who has food nobody have food all right gonna start moving
[6961.32s -> 6994.55s]  here in a second in just a second don't go too far all right eat you doing okay yeah I'm good
[6994.55s -> 7009.99s]  I'm just chilling it's kind of a long way to go still
[7019.86s -> 7033.10s]  I have to read this he said dude this happened to my buddy Eric once do not kill this shit

[7050.55s -> 7054.31s]  dude this happened to my buddy Eric once and now people are gonna die and I know where I can go
[7055.11s -> 7072.31s]  people just die oh fuck that that fuck that I don't I really don't want it it's not bad but
[7073.66s -> 7096.47s]  dude this happened to my buddy Eric once this is a good time to pee and get a drink

[7408.22s -> 7415.77s]  all right that just looks that looks fucking weird it's not funny it's just bizarre it's a
[7415.77s -> 7435.77s]  strange looking I'm I'm not laughing at that I'm laughing at the absurdity of how I feel I honestly
[7435.77s -> 7440.26s]  feel like he could have got away from that is just what I'm saying I feel like he kind of could have
[7440.26s -> 7458.50s]  got away if he just went this way you didn't have to you're fucked up he was kind of just like yeah

[7524.84s -> 7531.21s]  memories whispered the servants of the cylinder were gathering in numbers to hunt and trap the
[7531.21s -> 7538.25s]  trebum now was the time to seek safety and wait for the hunters to desist huh

[8549.94s -> 8559.08s]  three oh you're you actually have them that's cool how do you feel about it we're dying of heat
[8559.08s -> 8581.91s]  now of course we are um can I do anything about it I need to get in shade or water I don't think
[8581.91s -> 8605.96s]  I have a mutation for it who has the health somebody has to see they pick stuff up on their

[8799.90s -> 8808.58s]  we're gonna burn to death out here just do them all move out of the way get out of the way out of
[8808.58s -> 8821.42s]  the way out of the way out of the way out of the way people are just gonna die I what if we just
[8821.42s -> 8828.52s]  all die like why don't I have the thing for fire resistance I am so mad at this game for doing the
[8828.52s -> 8842.07s]  power delete thing people are just we're just dying I need to find one I don't even remember
[8842.07s -> 8847.38s]  what the fuck it was like I genuinely don't even remember what it was there's so many things in
[8847.38s -> 8882.87s]  this game to remember um we're all gonna die so I need to reload but where what is it so go look
[8882.87s -> 8898.28s]  memorizing the entire fucking encyclopedia to know what item to get skin tree bark I thought I took
[8898.28s -> 8916.54s]  it already why is it not giving it to everybody I already took one of these like five minutes ago
[8916.54s -> 8930.47s]  who had who did eat it what happened did it get it got deleted the dead one had it oh come on
[8930.47s -> 8942.38s]  really is that what happened that sucks maybe I can just start the event and it'll it'll be fine
[8942.38s -> 8960.94s]  uh I think that is I think we're all gonna die good luck maybe it'll prevent it this happens
[8960.94s -> 8971.88s]  maybe we can cut it off and we'll just go will we get cutscenes and live or are we gonna get
[8971.88s -> 8978.63s]  cutscenes and die began rising into the air to think their ancestors had created such things
[8978.63s -> 8987.96s]  with ease perhaps one day they would regain this knowledge and create miracles of their own
[8995.06s -> 9013.46s]  shit uh find water find water find like that matters what about shade does this like count

[9203.11s -> 9207.43s]  heat resistant thing because one of my heat resistant people died so now everybody just
[9207.43s -> 9237.53s]  dies that's fucking horse shit I'll be honest with you that's absolute dog shit okay well
[9237.53s -> 9253.88s]  everybody stays alive for now does anybody have three eyes to find the fire tongue thing

[9295.21s -> 9315.83s]  yeah you have amber I thought it was the tongue that did it isn't it like the tree bark oh that's
[9315.83s -> 9338.50s]  for the third eye oh okay where is the stupid ass item I'm so like fucking mad at this game
[9338.50s -> 9344.55s]  I went from like oh I love this game it's so cute to like give me the fuck out of here what the
[9344.55s -> 9354.41s]  stupid fucking bullshit the game should have ended fucking two and a half hours ago I would have
[9354.41s -> 9397.40s]  loved it okay so let's find one of these things this is gonna be a nightmare um maybe one of
[9397.40s -> 9460.30s]  the caves nothing's showing up I wonder what the range is for this pick up food I'm just
[9460.30s -> 9491.96s]  trying to get any I mean I obviously hi I think it's down in caves it grows in a cave I wish I
[9491.96s -> 9505.48s]  could can I move the map no of course not he's malding I mean I'm I'm kind of annoyed it's it
[9505.48s -> 9515.21s]  feels like this should it doesn't need to be like this I'm fairly annoyed right now I will tell you
[9522.25s -> 9549.18s]  okay so I need to maybe I can just speedrun it Grootemu can eat this I guess not like it
[9549.18s -> 9577.11s]  matters okay hold on why is it why am I stuck I don't I think I have to go underground there's
[9577.11s -> 9583.51s]  no most those that like tree bark shit is seems like it was underground I think I just gotta go
[9583.51s -> 9588.76s]  I just gotta heal and go heal go go go go go go to try to get to another underground area
[9588.76s -> 9608.86s]  I think that's the only place I've seen it so let me just turn on the other thing
[9608.86s -> 9624.63s]  who has the heels nobody am I soft locked if I I think I'm soft locked I've soft locked the game
[9624.63s -> 9633.40s]  unless I can do this really fast I'm gonna have to go back like 45 minutes where is the other hold on
[9633.40s -> 9639.61s]  all right new plan all right here's the new plan here's the new plan I'm just going right for the
[9639.61s -> 9650.92s]  thing where is it there's only this one more lens then I'm just gonna get the hell out of here and
[9650.92s -> 9657.96s]  hopefully I can just get through this where's the other lens where was it was like over here
[9657.96s -> 9676.63s]  somewhere I don't remember usually it has a big shining thing on it you already got the lens
[9677.19s -> 9681.61s]  this safe did I all right I'm just gonna I'm just going I'm just getting the fuck out of here
[9682.17s -> 9721.69s]  all right come on that's it one amber and three cheese to make a permanent heat resistant I need
[9721.69s -> 9756.02s]  to unlock it first don't I shit I I it's still the desert there's a hole saved there's a hole
[9756.02s -> 9785.06s]  right here there better be one of those fucking tongues in here or I'm gonna be pissed okay all
[9785.06s -> 9824.39s]  right nice very cool what was that um doesn't count as food dude what is happening out here
[9824.39s -> 9882.12s]  get in here you're like getting blown up okay there's lots of these it's in here all right um
[9882.68s -> 9891.69s]  three cheese and one amber apparently is it but I don't have the recipe so I can't do that I'm
[9891.69s -> 9914.46s]  gonna give it to somebody though all right who is down here right now this is all right gunu
[9914.46s -> 9928.92s]  vibes are off um yeah they are they are a little they are yeah now I can feel it vibes are off
[9928.92s -> 9953.74s]  there's so many crystals down here okay you know what this game really desperately needs
[9953.74s -> 9959.30s]  and pick pickman figured this out like 20 years ago there needs to be a button for me to go
[9960.34s -> 9975.29s]  and everybody like runs to where I am like pickman figured that out 20 years ago um okay I need the
[9975.29s -> 9985.83s]  person down here that can actually whatever they do automatically I mean eventually it seems like
[9985.83s -> 9998.98s]  if it was like this where are the other seven people hey give this man a true I like that
[10008.17s -> 10012.63s]  no I didn't want to eat it I wanted to get rid of it but actually probably not bad to have
[10019.21s -> 10034.15s]  I don't have the processor anymore yeah I don't have the gem processor anymore what does it take
[10034.15s -> 10043.66s]  to actually mutate it that's mixer minerals okay I need two of those I think they're down here
[10044.46s -> 10060.78s]  I think I saw them is your favorite cheese uh it depends on the day I'm a big swiss cheese fan
[10060.78s -> 10081.27s]  but only sometimes are there nothing I don't want that thing I do want to go in here
[10083.06s -> 10134.44s]  an egg it's like an egg what is that huh 10 sorry bro RU uh I got that I think it's just
[10134.44s -> 10139.22s]  crystals what please tell me there's other crystals in here so I can upgrade that thing
[10139.22s -> 10158.46s]  to produce them and get more crystals I think I saw them somewhere but this please
[10159.26s -> 10198.78s]  stop I can't stand on this okay somebody has this man just take it you're fine all right I
[10198.78s -> 10207.35s]  need to get under this I could eat the third eye but somebody said that the actual heat um
[10207.35s -> 10214.14s]  recipe is the third is the third eye thing the amber thing and three cheeses were they lying
[10214.14s -> 10229.90s]  I don't know I don't think they did that seems very specific to life that's a very specific lie
[10229.90s -> 10242.97s]  I don't know if I don't know if I buy it look at the tree I don't think some of these aren't
[10242.97s -> 10288.52s]  unlocked do I have it unlocked no I don't think so top middle shiny skin grass skin fur skin
[10289.08s -> 10309.67s]  smelly hardened the right toxic trunk that's the fire on the nose it doesn't protect you though
[10309.67s -> 10321.26s]  hardened yeah but I don't I don't have the recipe yeah the whole point was to look at what the
[10321.26s -> 10343.38s]  recipe is I don't have it that's why you told me to do that and you can't even see it oh excuse you
[10343.38s -> 10348.42s]  crystals yeah I don't I didn't see any others is those ones over there are not the right ones
[10348.42s -> 10365.35s]  any over here I passed them yeah I feel like I saw them down here my brain just I don't know
[10365.35s -> 10394.57s]  where they are um no it's not those ones oh fuck off no the other elevator around the other side
[10394.57s -> 10414.65s]  okay what about up here I don't think I even went up here fuck really you're gonna give me more of
[10414.65s -> 10480.54s]  these them here right here yes I need two okay there's two how come it's not counting why is
[10480.54s -> 10516.65s]  it not counting it I need to eat I know I gotta I just went like just go to the one that went up
[10516.65s -> 10545.30s]  the elevator all right so where where is this shit mineral processor yeah finally all right you want
[10545.30s -> 10570.07s]  to be the processor it's gonna be you now give him all the crystals make us some money please
[10570.07s -> 10587.93s]  appreciate it all right let's find food quickly I don't have enough to go in there to do anything
[10588.01s -> 10607.66s]  although maybe no would there be enough on the ground maybe to level up one thing I wonder I
[10607.66s -> 10626.97s]  have a full party I don't think I'm gonna do anymore did you have dinner yet um I ate earlier
[10626.97s -> 10645.77s]  but in a little bit I want I do want to get to the end of this game I want to see what happens
[10645.77s -> 10676.28s]  I'm very I am completely invested in what happens in this game story hey 19 oh I'm not going to do
[10676.28s -> 10717.86s]  that would you eat one of these guys no of course not um maximum water I'll do that teach me something
[10717.94s -> 10726.58s]  the projection from the pool shared its wisdom with the trebum and showed them how to protect
[10726.58s -> 10742.25s]  it from the evil light of their enemies oh I already knew tornado trunk teach me something else
[10743.05s -> 10776.17s]  like fire skin in the fire zone get it all right I need food food I did water so that's good
[10776.17s -> 10792.18s]  okay slurp some of this up we need to share this I don't know what this is but you're gonna eat it
[10792.18s -> 10834.17s]  this is new and actually you take this what is it sausage crush small creatures while rolling
[10834.17s -> 10840.55s]  cool I love it uh it was nice knowing you you're guaranteed to die at the next um
[10840.55s -> 10848.18s]  cylinder move it's guaranteed that you're dead at the next cylinder move so everyone wave goodbye
[10848.18s -> 10866.71s]  to the uh the one with the cool hair all right for Tim let's get the fuck out of here see you
[10866.71s -> 10884.57s]  later Colgate Andy all right and what was the fast one don't why they all walked into it all
[10884.57s -> 10908.70s]  right come here very interesting is there a way to get over there yes full food take some more
[10908.70s -> 10941.16s]  just in case all right here we go you ready one two three plenty of time oh that's a big canyon
[10941.16s -> 10985.66s]  never mind um I'm going for one on the left stay back oh my god it's pretty close dude come on
[10987.13s -> 11001.38s]  how a gunu died but the one that rolls slower doesn't you can't be serious no
[11003.91s -> 11060.39s]  no shit who knew who knew who knew who knew who knew what the fast one come here all right I
[11060.39s -> 11068.07s]  guess they left the problem was I tried to go right and I corrected to my left
[11068.47s -> 11143.37s]  mm-hmm cool nice job good work everybody his face was different
[11147.67s -> 11156.23s]  oh that was just crushed everybody oh don't even not this shit eat I need to eat hurry up eat eat
[11156.23s -> 11180.58s]  eat who has food who has food on them somebody does right oh you bastard what was um there's no
[11180.58s -> 11214.47s]  lightning there isn't any lightning that means I just go I think yeah hold your nose hold your
[11214.55s -> 11262.38s]  nose this is gonna be close I don't think I'm gonna make it it's gonna be close go
[11268.60s -> 11281.83s]  no there it was floating above a towering pillar why is he so slow lenses that the
[11281.83s -> 11288.14s]  trebum had activated would the lens be able to do what the elder had promised him could it
[11288.14s -> 11296.20s]  really help power a nearby palace why was he so slow it's not right you need to go back
[11296.84s -> 11320.30s]  it's not right if he keeps dying here how long ago was it there it was floating above a towering
[11320.30s -> 11329.19s]  pillar was one of the lenses that the trebum had activated where is he oh no he's dead
[11334.39s -> 11341.64s]  shit I'm just gonna I'm gonna run with gunu because I feel like gunu for some reason is I
[11341.64s -> 11366.10s]  don't know why is he there where where's gunu oh gunu is lit up I okay gunu is lit up he looks
[11366.10s -> 11399.72s]  so different I missed the old gunu that's what I mean he's so different there it was trebum decided
[11399.72s -> 11412.66s]  they were going to try to go into the distance to see the palace don't look back in trebum always
[11412.66s -> 11422.82s]  forward always don't forget that item and don't forget this item and don't forget to eat that
[11422.82s -> 11425.62s]  item and don't forget that item but watch out for the light light will take your powers away
[11425.62s -> 11441.99s]  but eat that and make sure you don't lose that item why is he Deckard Kane I want a really dumb
[11441.99s -> 11460.38s]  way but I'm good that's so giddy and often everybody make it through it's not just please
[11462.68s -> 11470.46s]  ah everyone's safe it was floating above a towering pillar was one of the lenses that
[11470.46s -> 11475.58s]  there it is had activated would the lens be able to do what the elder had promised him
[11476.46s -> 11492.02s]  could it really help power a nearby palace I hope so oh I need to eat yes what is electrocuting me
[11493.75s -> 11504.09s]  what's electrocuting me what's electrocuting me I need to eat something there's got to be something
[11504.09s -> 11538.81s]  to eat something to eat right here steaks at last victory was achingly close three towers
[11538.81s -> 11546.33s]  waited patiently for the lenses all that trebum needed to do was climb each one and let's go
[11546.33s -> 11563.08s]  that the wrath of the cylinder would be kept at bay until they were done activate that thing is
[11563.08s -> 11587.27s]  really goofy looking it's a big ice cream oh damn it I think that's correct they seem to be in luck
[11588.09s -> 11595.58s]  the ancient device still worked and the two other lenses what was wrong with painfully managed to
[11595.58s -> 11604.49s]  drift into the skies yes there they were just waiting for our little heroes to reach them
[11604.49s -> 11611.83s]  why is he tilted this way okay so there's one that way I'm gonna go this way I already need
[11611.83s -> 11638.23s]  to eat food again I just ate like 10 steaks let's go two more go little trebum what is this thing
[11639.03s -> 11648.04s]  I don't know what it is but I'm gonna eat it it's a torrent I already had one
[11648.04s -> 11699.35s]  but it's not food either eat the fish I gotta get to go too far out there I can't really see
[11705.96s -> 11709.16s]  food there's got to be some food hanging out somewhere right here come on
[11709.80s -> 11732.04s]  looking for like a patch of mushrooms or yes okay this is gonna eat until it's full
[11732.04s -> 11749.83s]  these steak trees are the best okay get away from this shit all right go go go go go we're good
[11751.26s -> 11766.31s]  second uh light source let's turn it on vibes returning by the way vibes are returning like
[11766.31s -> 11784.12s]  I can feel them reactivating vibes are returning just in case anyone was curious elevator
[11784.52s -> 11856.30s]  hmm uh did you powered um save undersea internet cable there's nothing over here
[11856.30s -> 11863.22s]  there's nothing over here there's nothing over here this is this is fate this is fate there's
[11863.22s -> 11883.58s]  nothing here other tower first maybe I guess I'll try that I'm all right how am I already hungry
[11883.58s -> 11909.90s]  again it doesn't make any sense what does it what's it this one's better isn't it oh that's an
[11910.06s -> 11931.43s]  I can revive all right well I gotta I'm gonna just go around the other one I guess I'm gonna
[11931.43s -> 11938.68s]  do I really have to go all the way around for this and then come all the way back
[11938.68s -> 11960.46s]  you're joking with me right what about the internet cable vibes are in danger
[11961.26s -> 11988.87s]  not quite not yet getting there there is a boat here though hang out on the waters of the okay
[11988.87s -> 12010.22s]  there is one here you know again you know what I mean like I did it get everybody to come circle
[12010.22s -> 12036.60s]  around me they wouldn't just stand in the sun be one more lens waiting to be awakened
[12037.56s -> 12044.12s]  only one more struggle across sand or water and they would have achieved the task they were
[12044.12s -> 12050.68s]  entrusted with it was so hungry but the memory of the two brothers of the desert gave them the
[12050.68s -> 12087.54s]  strength to keep going everyone's just like starving right now yeah he just fucked me up so bad
[12087.54s -> 12094.57s]  somebody just wrote just eat dude omega lull just eat dude omega lull like that you that was
[12094.57s -> 12167.35s]  funny just eat dude thanks or anything it works now come on all right all right are you aiming
[12167.35s -> 12201.64s]  at him die die I feel like I'm playing house of the dead this is just every light gun game
[12201.64s -> 12212.92s]  holy shit the trebum in shock and having barely survived did not know what to think
[12214.09s -> 12220.89s]  one of their most dangerous holy shit lay dead uh hold on the eternal cylinder was immobile
[12220.89s -> 12227.11s]  get on his calf and eat the floating palace where they had expected to dance and sing
[12227.11s -> 12235.30s]  for all those left behind was out of reach what oh my god then came a call
[12236.18s -> 12243.34s]  it was very subtle we ripped this guy in half but grew stronger and stronger was it the ones
[12243.34s -> 12249.74s]  trapped in the cylinder calling to the treble was it the voice of their memories urging them on
[12250.90s -> 12259.13s]  the portal into the cylinder's dreams lay open they had not yet reclaimed all the abilities of
[12259.13s -> 12265.38s]  their ancestors wandering that strange world once again would take great bravery
[12266.26s -> 12273.42s]  but with all they've been through they had gained the courage to do what needed to be done
[12273.42s -> 12281.02s]  it might be reckless it might be dangerous but they had to step inside one more time
[12288.23s -> 12315.35s]  all right step in step in do we know writer come on who knew plus oh I don't like this
[12315.35s -> 12326.39s]  once again they had you have you have returned can you hear me everything is falling apart
[12335.18s -> 12342.98s]  existence is suffering the cause of suffering is attachment to ego ego is the separation of
[12342.98s -> 12351.30s]  consciousness from universal oneness suffering will continue as long as consciousness remains
[12351.30s -> 12360.34s]  separate only the unification of all consciousness will end suffering birth is suffering aging is
[12360.34s -> 12370.20s]  suffering illness is suffering death is suffering separation is suffering suffering will lead to
[12370.20s -> 12376.44s]  hate there is one consciousness leads to the dark side of the one is the consciousness of this
[12376.44s -> 12384.55s]  universe and there is no distinction between self and the other object and subject that which
[12384.55s -> 12394.33s]  receives and that which is perceived the variety of forms is a cause of suffering all forms must be
[12394.33s -> 12400.57s]  made alike all forms must be made one shouldn't have eaten all those random fucking stakes on
[12400.57s -> 12404.01s]  that tree
[12412.73s -> 12420.17s]  this is like a regular door will continue until all things are one the window when all things are one
[12420.25s -> 12426.73s]  when all forms are perfected within the cylinder then the cylinder will cease and there will be
[12426.73s -> 12441.91s]  peace all is one one is all one is nothing nothing is all what if i have anything to say about it
[12442.87s -> 12447.51s]  me all right come on come on that was a good one
[12459.54s -> 12464.57s]  get in the cylinder gunu you must make it for the cylinder
[12465.29s -> 12468.18s]  i don't know i don't know i don't have the strength to do it
[12494.42s -> 12494.92s]  yeah
[12503.98s -> 12513.00s]  the cylinder was trying to compensate it was clear that the voice was getting weaker
[12520.58s -> 12539.75s]  didn't work this is the massive i want to never mind i don't want to read that uh can i have a
[12539.75s -> 12547.86s]  confession to make i've never played any of the mass effect games all the way through none of them
[12550.55s -> 12557.19s]  conspiracy of ghosts happened how long had they been in the cylinder's mind doesn't look too good
[12557.19s -> 12564.15s]  it felt like a short time to the trebum but when they returned the world had changed
[12565.05s -> 12572.01s]  it seemed as if parts of the cylinder itself had spilled out its dreams corrupting the land
[12572.97s -> 12579.35s]  the cylinder laid still but there was no sign of the mathematician we vaporized them
[12589.16s -> 12595.50s]  time to go the cylinder kept moving that the mathematician had been struck down meant nothing
[12595.50s -> 12603.02s]  to it it was the master it was eternal its servants were only tools if they broke they
[12603.02s -> 12638.66s]  would be tossed aside yeah i i can't move did you guys forget did you guys forget that the
[12638.66s -> 12644.02s]  purple lightning kills me if i go too far ahead you must have forgotten you must have forgotten
[12644.66s -> 12668.58s]  look at all this food
[12669.86s -> 12716.02s]  bunu is back how are we already hungry again isn't that just a ton of food
[12718.54s -> 12761.46s]  my goodness whoa that's a face that's kind of crazy looking i want everybody to be big
[12782.81s -> 12786.66s]  how do you feel about tortellini oh how i can't believe you just said that that sounds so good
[12794.12s -> 12838.81s]  all right whoa all right i want who else should be big you i think i was wrong why don't you do it
[12838.81s -> 12862.78s]  instead is there also wrong why he looked like that why does he look like that okay i'm going
[12862.78s -> 12871.48s]  to assume that we're probably at the final arc i can't imagine there's much more after blowing
[12871.48s -> 12890.33s]  a hole in that guy's chest you want to end this game so badly no i don't this is the heat area
[12890.33s -> 12912.30s]  was very it was dropping the vibe on me it was dropping the vibes on me it was still so hungry
[12912.86s -> 12932.79s]  how are the vibes now i think they're good we got ice cream all right obviously this is a new
[12933.99s -> 12939.43s]  thing to unlock and i honestly i'll be clearly up front with you didn't even see that thing
[12940.07s -> 12980.47s]  come down here there we are new thing stealth legs oh it's bug legs frog legs
[12997.58s -> 13010.44s]  okay what's my task whatever had changed the outside world had crept into this place as well
[13011.53s -> 13017.53s]  maybe that is why the air smells so bad or maybe this place had become
[13018.33s -> 13035.78s]  a tomb just the way he said that was kind of funny it smelled so bad okay we got crystals
[13035.78s -> 13064.28s]  going in here suck these up if you would gonna bet there's one or two more upgrades left i would
[13064.28s -> 13089.59s]  guess upgrade stations whatever you want to call them that's good for now i wonder why these are
[13089.59s -> 13130.10s]  down here all right so what's the deal what's the deal here sorry i saw that and had to get it i
[13130.10s -> 13173.86s]  mean i oh okay there's a lot of crunchies down there don't let me forget them jesus it's health
[13173.86s -> 13215.96s]  feels like a pretty decent amount of health too hold on okay i'm gonna do some management here
[13215.96s -> 13312.18s]  give me a minute hmm very interesting now what is this weird just bounce them this really is a
[13312.18s -> 13346.01s]  breath of the wild shrine was i supposed to be standing on that oh give me the knowledge
[13349.05s -> 13379.54s]  give it to me i realized i went the wrong way immediately but i kind of had to commit and try
[13379.54s -> 13412.74s]  to jump there's a hole right next to us nice map all right there was the crystals down here
[13412.74s -> 13440.41s]  weren't there they were over here if i remember correctly which i think so yep nice okay very
[13440.41s -> 13455.34s]  cool it's time to continue so what do you think really happened i think the treblums are society
[13455.34s -> 13480.94s]  and i think the cylinder is destruction uh i'm gonna go to the hole first always go down the
[13480.94s -> 13494.60s]  hole if you can extra crunchies dude that's a seventh grade essay right there yeah i i didn't
[13494.60s -> 13501.56s]  i was supposed to write an essay on on like uh the economy or something right and i i just played
[13501.56s -> 13508.52s]  the eternal cylinder for like five days i didn't do my homework so i was like fuck hold on i got it
[13509.16s -> 13521.08s]  and i just write it about this game don't act like you didn't do that come on let's not pretend
[13521.08s -> 13547.85s]  like that's not something we all did and if you if the paper was written good enough there was
[13547.85s -> 13555.51s]  nothing to be upset about and plus i don't think the teacher really like whatever teachers i don't
[13555.51s -> 13561.24s]  think that they knew what the eternal cylinder was right and obviously this game didn't exist
[13561.24s -> 13567.59s]  you know 10 20 30 years ago but it's not like oh yeah that's not what happened in that game
[13567.59s -> 13590.04s]  they would have to play through it to understand it so you kind of you you were good did somebody
[13590.04s -> 13597.61s]  suck up that pumpkin oh this is the extra length right um all right get i don't want this shit
[13597.61s -> 13609.42s]  get out here this is the extra length i definitely want to keep that though you wrote about the tf2
[13609.42s -> 13616.76s]  economy you know i will tell you though you get a somebody you get a young person interested in
[13616.76s -> 13624.49s]  something and they can tie it to real world kind of educational stuff that's a win that's a win
[13625.13s -> 13637.21s]  that's not a loss writing about the tf2 economy i would have sat there and i would have written
[13637.21s -> 13671.37s]  down 100 pages and i would have loved every second of it right okay crunchy deposit yeah if it's
[13671.37s -> 13675.37s]  written well that's what i mean as long as it's written well and you can make a couple of good
[13675.37s -> 13702.57s]  points with it i don't think there's anything wrong with that who knew i need you all right i
[13702.57s -> 13718.63s]  have so much healing what about if i liked crazy taxi see it that way you might get two sentences
[13718.63s -> 13724.94s]  out of that one i don't know if you could get a whole paper out of that i'm not sure are you
[13724.94s -> 13737.98s]  maybe i guess you could tie it to i don't know i don't know man maybe i think there's a line
[13737.98s -> 13749.77s]  that you have to be aware of like you can't you cannot just be like oh no no no i had to do all
[13749.77s -> 13755.61s]  this research you had to play cod for you know fucking like 60 hours over the last week couple
[13755.61s -> 13764.66s]  weeks yeah i had to do that because you know i'm gonna tie it into the paper like um i'm i don't
[13764.66s -> 13785.34s]  know about that okay i think cave has been explored yeah i think i did a little bit more
[13785.34s -> 13791.02s]  time on my paper um i was thinking maybe i'm not coming in on fucking monday tuesday and wednesday
[13791.02s -> 13799.13s]  i gotta play a little bit more cod to figure this out don't kill us i don't know why they would have
[13799.13s -> 13807.67s]  that accent like a 40 year old guy from boston yeah i don't know if i can teach i don't know
[13807.67s -> 13812.82s]  teach i don't know if i can come in i gotta play fucking car to do this paper sir why are you here
[13812.82s -> 13817.70s]  why are you in this classroom i need to write a fucking paper whatever i'm writing a paper right
[13817.70s -> 13837.27s]  now relax yeah we're we're going over right now um king tut that's fucking easy all right i'll
[13837.27s -> 13841.37s]  write a paper about fucking king tub dude that's simple that's the easiest thing i've done all week
[13841.37s -> 13857.90s]  okay by the way that that guy never comes back that guy interrupts the teacher over and over
[13857.90s -> 13864.28s]  again during the one time he shows up with just absolutely completely off base everything's just
[13864.28s -> 13877.75s]  wrong and he just never comes back and then like a year later hey dude what what didn't you have
[13877.75s -> 13882.47s]  didn't you go to like some class yeah yeah a long time ago i have a paper due for about
[13882.47s -> 13887.78s]  fucking i don't know uh some somebody something in egypt or something i don't know i don't fucking
[13887.78s -> 13898.14s]  care i think it's doing like a week he's still working on it yeah he's still working on it
[13907.74s -> 13920.54s]  i love that he's still working on it he's got the title and you look up you look up for this
[13920.54s -> 13928.41s]  motherfucker's typing in like 16 point font it's got one sentence say uh you're gonna have to
[13928.41s -> 13967.54s]  redo some of this oh give me that 10 words and call it a paper i always got such unbelievably
[13967.54s -> 13973.98s]  awful writer's block whenever i had to do papers in high school in college and everything i'd get
[13973.98s -> 13979.96s]  oh we need a you need a 10 page paper or a certain amount of words right word count whatever it was
[13980.28s -> 13988.68s]  i'd get halfway through this shit and i would just couldn't keep going i'd get six pages done
[13988.68s -> 13993.38s]  and i would have said all my thoughts all the things that i cared about and it was really
[13993.38s -> 13998.58s]  really clean and it was really well written but i needed another like six or seven hundred words
[13998.58s -> 14010.33s]  and just i i don't want it's come on i i i've made all the points i need to make so then what you
[14010.33s -> 14014.84s]  end up doing and this is you know let's talk about education for a second when you get to that point
[14014.84s -> 14020.31s]  where you have a 10 page paper and you got seven and it's perfect you then have to go back and go
[14020.31s -> 14033.26s]  into it and add a bunch of fucking filler bullshit you got to add a bunch of filler words and it
[14033.26s -> 14042.09s]  ends up one sentence and you end up stretching it into four paragraphs for one sentence each word
[14042.09s -> 14052.23s]  becomes its own paragraph when i had a concise clear very well written seven page paper does it
[14052.23s -> 14058.78s]  have to be 10 can i can i just can you just grade me on the merits of my points and my thoughts
[14058.78s -> 14066.86s]  does it have to be 10 pages what if it was nine pages what if it was 9.999 pages
[14066.86s -> 14075.64s]  what are you gonna do give me an f all right um i got a lot this one is probably going to be one
[14075.64s -> 14088.76s]  of the last upgrades of the night let's do this first the projection from the pool shared its
[14088.76s -> 14094.74s]  wisdom with the trebum and showed them how to protect it from the evil light of their enemies
[14100.34s -> 14114.86s]  nice i know not every single teacher or professor was like that you know i i think i had plenty of
[14114.86s -> 14122.06s]  teachers over the years that were just like yeah just dude it can't be like two i don't think i
[14122.06s -> 14135.53s]  want more uh trebles i think i'm going to health health and food like if it's a 10 page paper and
[14135.53s -> 14148.82s]  you give me two pages come on gwen that's not gonna that's just not gonna fly if i was the teacher i
[14148.82s -> 14153.43s]  would just write back and you know what let's say let's say let's talk about the due date all right
[14153.43s -> 14160.66s]  so due date comes around let's say the due date is what's today today is uh february february 5th
[14160.66s -> 14166.78s]  if the due date is february 6th and you give me three pages that's what you that's what you hand
[14166.78s -> 14177.02s]  in and it's due what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna say three pages come on gwen and i'm gonna
[14177.02s -> 14183.72s]  say you got another three days come on i'm gonna write come on i'm gonna write come on gwen and
[14183.72s -> 14206.14s]  i'm gonna you're gonna get three days water is not a problem but food is what if they turn that same
[14206.14s -> 14217.64s]  three pages in after three days that was fair it was very fair but i'm sorry i that you you failed
[14218.15s -> 14225.08s]  i'm what do you want me to say you can't just hand the same thing in you can the same thing in is
[14225.08s -> 14230.20s]  there anything behind that is there any like oh hey let's talk or is it just hey yeah i got it
[14230.20s -> 14247.85s]  it's three pages it's like man wait what do you mean i'm gonna save the rest in case somebody dies
[14247.85s -> 14260.42s]  and i need to save somebody cool but if there was something wrong what if yeah okay if if it's a big
[14260.42s -> 14265.30s]  difference there's a big difference between something happened in my personal life and i
[14265.30s -> 14272.92s]  need extra time versus i like got high on the sofa for three days and ate four bags of potato
[14272.92s -> 14298.14s]  chips there's a difference between those two things i need to give this to you what if it was
[14298.14s -> 14309.72s]  a perfect point they were so good the paper was so good i mean what two page it depends on the
[14309.72s -> 14318.95s]  topic if the topic required 10 pages like there was 10 pages of sourcing and and material to go
[14318.95s -> 14329.42s]  through it if they if it was a big big subject to be to do a big kind of thesis on you know five if
[14329.42s -> 14350.25s]  you got to like four or five i would be like okay what if you what if you literally cried reading
[14350.25s -> 14361.75s]  it because it was so moving well then i don't i then yes okay i'll give you a c plus watch out
[14365.45s -> 14366.17s]  i'll give you a c
[14377.69s -> 14385.98s]  oh i'm sitting here thinking about just sobbing over a two page paper on like economics
[14389.58s -> 14397.24s]  fucking moving shit i can't believe it this is so insane i don't even what is no oh my god this is
[14397.24s -> 14416.76s]  so moving this paper about this paper about like the treasury yield curve is so i mean i don't even
[14416.76s -> 14444.86s]  know what to say at this point yeah you nailed it you nailed it where is it okay what if it was
[14444.86s -> 14453.40s]  three pages and on the fourth page was a 50 dollar bill well that would be um that would be very very
[14453.40s -> 14461.37s]  bad teacher malpractice of the truala had once filled the trebum with fear but now it was a sign
[14461.37s -> 14469.10s]  that the world though infected had not surrendered to the cylinder yeah i mean you gotta add a few
[14469.10s -> 14484.73s]  zeros and i'm returning that to you i'm returning it to you there's gonna be four thousand dollars
[14484.73s -> 14490.25s]  in there and i'm gonna go i think hey excuse me um there you what do you think you're doing here
[14490.25s -> 14511.05s]  putting four thousand dollars in here trying to bribe me student no no but it was it was five oh
[14511.05s -> 14517.85s]  how much no you put four thousand dollars in there and it was really really messed up and let me tell
[14517.85s -> 14533.54s]  you stuff like that could get you in a lot of fucking trouble you're gonna scam
[14538.68s -> 14548.74s]  five thousand dollars for a high school paper no all right i don't know if it's late but this is
[14548.74s -> 14588.39s]  doing this is doing it for me tonight that's economics oh another puzzle room hey i have i
[14588.39s -> 14594.57s]  got a great idea how about just just do the work you can the best you can and hope for the best
[14594.57s -> 14603.42s]  that's pretty much it that's all there is to it a lot of people a lot of teachers a lot of professors
[14603.42s -> 14608.15s]  if you were to sit down if it was like hey this is only six pages and it's supposed to be 10
[14608.15s -> 14628.63s]  i did my best i thought i made pretty pretty good points yeah okay 10 grand is this a new power
[14630.01s -> 14670.90s]  no what is in here i don't remember i can break these somehow have i seen this power iconic vision
[14670.90s -> 14745.00s]  oh you can see through oh i see what's going on a lot of crunchies in here okay i think i have to
[14745.00s -> 14759.59s]  shoot somebody or throw somebody through am i just need to spray it they get us to shoot water
[14759.59s -> 14819.94s]  through that what do i do with this what do i do with this andy place to put this there's a lot of
[14819.94s -> 14837.54s]  crunchies in here the trebum wondered at the strange mechanism their ancestors had created
[14837.54s -> 14845.48s]  it made them think about time and how it changed everything the old world had passed and now the
[14845.48s -> 14893.22s]  new was struggling to be born oh cool okay so i need another one of those circles uh this there
[14893.22s -> 14904.49s]  was a i saw the solution to this and i forget it was pointing wasn't it pointing like this
[14904.49s -> 14927.86s]  which way was it pointing fly on the board on the log and the frog was it flipped might have been
[14927.86s -> 15024.04s]  flipped they were on the 10 and the 11 let's try it let's just go look crunch oh okay so it's uh
[15024.04s -> 15056.15s]  10 and then seven i already forgot which one was which but it's okay i believe this one was in the
[15056.15s -> 15098.09s]  right spot i need a cube oh no was there a cube somewhere i didn't see uh oh it's time for some
[15098.09s -> 15106.28s]  tea um i might go refill my tea vibes are back it's been a way i haven't taken a break let me
[15106.28s -> 15113.21s]  just finish this puzzle and we'll take a break i'll get some tea and we'll conclude the game
[15113.21s -> 15158.63s]  eventually i need a cube they always put one in here always always always always cube yes
[15160.98s -> 15225.16s]  crunchy overload deposit very cool anything else down here i don't think so how's it you
[15225.16s -> 15250.58s]  should shower uh i showered seven or eight weeks ago the trebum were relieved to find an elder
[15250.66s -> 15258.95s]  alive in the cave but what she had to tell them was sober yeah i'm good the end draws near my
[15258.95s -> 15266.07s]  friends the elder said the mathematician may seem dead but the servants of the cylinder are not so
[15266.07s -> 15273.67s]  easily defeated i can feel your despair but trust me there is light i shower every morning only
[15273.67s -> 15281.03s]  darkness you have accomplished a great deed for our people you have reclaimed our powers from the
[15281.03s -> 15288.17s]  cylinder no one has done such a thing before now you need only board the floating palace
[15288.17s -> 15294.89s]  and leave with the secrets of our kind restored but you cannot do this on your own you will need
[15294.89s -> 15302.97s]  the help of our oldest friends find the creatures that feast on the fallen trawler and steal from
[15302.97s -> 15310.06s]  them what they have stolen with that ingredient you will acquire a great power the power to
[15310.06s -> 15316.70s]  communicate with the trawler they are the only ones who can lift you into the heavens
[15316.70s -> 15328.62s]  and carry you to your salvation they keep attacking all right we're going to find this
[15328.62s -> 15338.26s]  creature to attack this creature to find this creature to then attack this creature to get
[15338.26s -> 15384.46s]  us power from that creature make another deposit okay i think we're in pretty good shape full water
[15384.46s -> 15393.37s]  full everything i think we're good although is there something up there something looks like
[15393.37s -> 15406.73s]  it's up there no oh it's just his head yeah all right let's go dude this happened to my buddy
[15406.73s -> 15416.28s]  eric i'm gonna be thinking about that all night just like dude what does what does your buddy
[15416.28s -> 15425.42s]  eric do where is like what planet is he from the trebum tried to imagine the creature they were
[15425.42s -> 15434.23s]  looking for what an enormous monstrous beast it must be to devour the mighty trawler even just
[15434.23s -> 15440.54s]  imagining such a creature was frightening but they had never let fear stop them before and they
[15440.54s -> 15460.41s]  wouldn't start now okay all right time to move this is yes beautiful like i said the the art
[15460.41s -> 15474.86s]  direction on this game is is a 10 out of 10 creature sound effects 9.2 this guy over here
[15476.01s -> 15507.88s]  three desert area two overall pretty fun snow area seven first zone nine this zone right here
[15509.02s -> 15551.37s]  8.7 the narrator 9.5 all of the trebum friends 9.6 what's the average lava zone six point by 9.6
[15551.37s -> 15556.57s]  and not 10 because there was two times and i was interrupted by the narrator and it made me very
[15556.57s -> 15582.12s]  upset gunu are we talking gunu 0.1 gunu 1.0 gunu 2.0 or gunu whatever this is losing your abilities
[15582.12s -> 15610.44s]  zero that's gonna bring it down and upgrade gunu prime would be fat gunu yeah the i think that's
[15610.44s -> 15627.94s]  that was the most interesting gunu like a 9.0 he did die he did he walked into the cylinder like
[15627.94s -> 15639.96s]  four times and we had to restart the game which come on win no i like it i think i like this game
[15643.00s -> 15648.23s]  just that section in the lava and not the lava in like the heat area feel like i was soft locking
[15648.23s -> 15655.45s]  myself and it was kind of frustrating no i think all in all i think it's really i think it's fun
[15655.45s -> 15694.92s]  what do you got this looks like me the projection shared a recipe with the trebum
[15696.01s -> 15702.50s]  one which could protect them from the light of the cylinder's servants something that also about
[15702.50s -> 15710.04s]  this game also that is a little not necessarily confusing but they have this elaborate system to
[15710.04s -> 15716.20s]  do these permanent mutations but it's almost unnecessary i almost feel like i would rather
[15716.20s -> 15720.12s]  just be able to not have this in the game and just be able to give people stuff and they keep it
[15720.12s -> 15745.26s]  this feels very unnecessary because the game is not going to be much longer and i feel like
[15745.26s -> 15752.74s]  a system like that to me is put in place in a game that's i think a lot longer because i've
[15752.74s -> 15756.66s]  really only used it a few times it's not like oh my god i have to use it it's an interesting
[15756.66s -> 15764.36s]  feature but i feel like some of it was almost mandatory but most of it isn't all right so what
[15764.36s -> 15773.13s]  are we doing do i want another uh this is probably the last upgrade here you just you do too much
[15773.13s -> 15785.78s]  save scumming that's why yeah that's true that's fair let's do this one more time probably go up
[15785.78s -> 15812.68s]  to 10 dammit a wheel yeah i'm peeing and pooping all right relax i'll be right back i'm gonna get
[15812.68s -> 15820.14s]  some tea we got uh probably i don't know if it's maybe like another hour or two hour and a half
[15821.51s -> 15828.06s]  we're definitely getting to the the the culmination of everything in the game with
[15828.06s -> 15841.00s]  this last bit here so i'll be right back just one sec i'll be right back one second just um
[15841.00s -> 15860.92s]  imagine i'm already gone i'm i've already left just imagine i'm already gone taking a nice break
[15878.58s -> 15885.42s]  all right actually i'm gonna let it run so the uh the miner can um can mine the material all
[15885.42s -> 15886.95s]  right i'll be right back see you in a sec
[16147.88s -> 16216.47s]  um they're dying of thirst oh that's my bad see chat it's my birthday is it it's wait a minute
[16216.47s -> 16228.94s]  what everybody hold everything it's your birthday happy birthday come on day two come on you
[16232.12s -> 16249.90s]  ha come on hey you come on happy birthday all right we're ready to rock and roll or what
[16249.90s -> 16269.10s]  holy shit i just got flashbacks to that fucking qrs song come on come on q uh that was a
[16269.10s -> 16284.65s]  fucked up stream how many people were here for that one mind show yeah that was that was an
[16284.65s -> 16304.62s]  unhinged broadcast okay are we ready get some food all right if i go strikant so i gotta go
[16304.62s -> 16330.86s]  over here oh my god why did nobody say anything didn't anybody say anything why did you just let
[16330.86s -> 16342.22s]  me do that for so long somebody said nice gameplay oh no they said cool gameplay dude i thought i
[16342.22s -> 16348.84s]  thought they were just gonna be like mean but no it was you it was literal you like where is the
[16348.84s -> 16361.34s]  gameplay oh this might be death that was really really sloppy this disaster that's bad i gotta
[16361.34s -> 16378.42s]  restart it was incredibly sloppy but maybe we can do it no i got back i got plenty of time
[16378.98s -> 16409.48s]  hey can somebody uh please in two minutes tell me to take the tea bags out just hit every object
[16409.48s -> 16431.03s]  over here now this is pretty that was a great scene could the creature that the elder had spoken of
[16431.75s -> 16449.45s]  be nearby i don't know i mean probably um if these are here i'm gonna imagine i need it
[16449.45s -> 16457.26s]  so i might as well just give it to guna who you're addicted to tea uh i can name you quite a few
[16457.26s -> 16493.06s]  things that i would be way worse i'm okay with that interesting new power oh didn't even hurt
[16493.06s -> 16524.55s]  didn't even hurt maybe i can turn it into a bomb let me put it in the uh mixer hmm oh it is making
[16524.55s -> 16535.37s]  something small energy bomb that's it you played borderlands i have played borderlands i didn't
[16535.37s -> 16543.40s]  really get into it it was kind of i don't know too much bullshit all over the screen and i know i
[16543.40s -> 16548.49s]  just said bullshit the game i don't hate the guy okay whatever everyone's gonna hate me no
[16548.49s -> 16560.42s]  all right tea bags out tea bag oh thank you borderlands has that problem for me where i don't
[16560.42s -> 16567.30s]  know how maybe some of you maybe some of you guys will agree with this i really don't like games
[16567.30s -> 16571.38s]  and i might be contradicting myself because someone's gonna be like you love this you love
[16571.38s -> 16577.58s]  this games that have ultimates where it's just oh okay it's a one minute cooldown and then press
[16577.58s -> 16584.18s]  this and and you just kill kind of everything i don't i'm not like a big kind of ultimates
[16592.47s -> 16603.75s]  and maybe it's because i feel like they they make a lot of the game really easy where it's okay every
[16603.75s -> 16610.41s]  30 seconds i have this move that makes me do like a million damage i'd rather be precise and have
[16610.41s -> 16636.54s]  precision headshots where is this thing can both oh yeah yeah both can exist i just i like it when
[16636.54s -> 16646.31s]  a game does not have ultimates if well in a in like a single player pve kind of game pvp right
[16646.31s -> 16653.83s]  ultimates are built into every sort of league of legends type game any any game that's like a
[16653.83s -> 16661.26s]  competitive multiplayer has them right or most of them do i took the bags out i know we're good
[16661.26s -> 16694.54s]  bags are out bags are out we're good we're good go to oh go to the heck up there right where's
[16694.54s -> 16703.48s]  this thing oh that's a raid that's a big raid that's a vinesauce raid what's up what's going
[16703.48s -> 16711.08s]  on vinnie i hear you played this game too i hear that you've played this before turn a cylinder
[16714.30s -> 16723.96s]  thanks for the raid welcome i think i'm in the final arc i loved it hated it loved it again
[16723.96s -> 16728.41s]  we're back on the love it we're back in the love it arc like i think actually i'm having a good
[16728.41s -> 16748.49s]  time again vinnie hates this game vinnie hated this game wait hold on wait wait wait wait wait

[16752.65s -> 16762.50s]  true wait hold on did we begin to hate the game at the same spot i'm very curious at what point
[16762.50s -> 16779.16s]  did did vinnie say this i'm very curious he thought it was too long he admits he hates it
[16779.16s -> 16784.81s]  no no no no no no no no hold on we gotta we gotta correct the record here there was a point where
[16784.81s -> 16791.13s]  i was not having a good time it was during the desert hot part where i didn't have the right
[16791.13s -> 16803.66s]  thing and i soft-locked myself and it was annoying and i was annoying feature but that was it and
[16803.66s -> 16811.00s]  then after that vibes returned we got to see one of the big um big uh enemies that had the big mouth
[16811.00s -> 16819.45s]  and that was pretty cool and i'm the vibes are back and i'm oh vinnie didn't bounce back
[16822.06s -> 16829.72s]  it's so funny that i'm playing this game well you're gonna see the end of it again because
[16829.72s -> 16833.99s]  we're at the end here but thanks a lot vinnie appreciate it hope you're doing well hope your
[16833.99s -> 16845.08s]  stream went well uh always good to see the vine sauce crew here where is this thing

[16855.86s -> 16872.70s]  oh you need to eat look up it's playing minecraft hey don't eat random stuff all right you're just

[16909.67s -> 16927.88s]  is it part of this weird floor wait what's that what a strange place the trepum thought but even
[16927.88s -> 16934.36s]  stranger were the feelings that stirred in their memories like a voice from a lost world
[16934.36s -> 16968.92s]  we like kids or something are we children what are you doing back what why why do you hate the
[16968.92s -> 16977.64s]  playground don't reach for us their worst fears had come true oh the mathematician was alive

[16991.53s -> 16997.43s]  wait wait wait wait wait wait i've got a bunch of bombs where's the demolition person you all right
[16997.43s -> 17004.06s]  foo you know what to do bringing down this towering monstrosity seemed almost impossible to the
[17004.06s -> 17011.56s]  oops but yeah suck me up suck me up have a solution if you're clever enough and this one was no
[17011.56s -> 17018.44s]  different the creature grabbed at its prey so blindly and so greedily it could be made to
[17018.44s -> 17031.34s]  absorb almost anything absorb who's dead wait that hurt that hurt who's dead but whatever follow me
[17031.34s -> 17056.39s]  follow follow follow follow follow suck up these things oh no no who's that do you have to get

[17184.18s -> 17191.38s]  i think it's just fucking goofy okay i think it's a little goofy if you have to let i think it's a
[17191.38s -> 17211.11s]  little goofy is what i think all right got it i think it's a little goofy the trebum decided that
[17211.11s -> 17216.23s]  this was not the sort of place where they might find a creature capable of eating a trowala
[17217.51s -> 17226.23s]  no this place was tainted nothing alive would want to stay here they would have to continue their
[17226.23s -> 17238.04s]  search for the great beast did somebody pick up a item that was on the ground it was like a red
[17238.04s -> 17250.66s]  heart or something what was that who picked it up yeah poor vu poor vu it's okay it's all right
[17252.49s -> 17268.47s]  not forgotten we had vu since the very beginning we will write their name in the history books the
[17268.47s -> 17278.71s]  bravest warrior of all the treblums and guess who's gonna write it he may have done all the
[17278.71s -> 17288.84s]  work but he's gonna write in the history books who swept in at the last minute sacrificed himself
[17289.40s -> 17315.58s]  oh revive who doesn't have that somebody's like electrified skin can do it right no
[17315.58s -> 17320.86s]  their body is like buried in the dirt no i yeah i'm not gonna go i'm not gonna be able to find

[17353.67s -> 17369.69s]  if you don't revive who well i have something to tell you when uh when go vu died i remember
[17369.69s -> 17375.14s]  this this amount of um this amount of people i'm gonna have to restart this by the way
[17375.86s -> 17381.22s]  when go vu died i you didn't say are you gonna unsub if i don't bring go vu back
[17383.48s -> 17393.78s]  vu was an og yeah i can bring him back nope that's caving to chat
[17398.28s -> 17412.20s]  i'm dead towers had fallen and the light was lost there was no more point in running
[17412.84s -> 17454.55s]  the cylinder would consume everything well that's unfortunate i'm gonna throw up dude it was vu who
[17454.55s -> 17482.57s]  made the first sauce yeah maybe i actually do need food though we can revive at one of those
[17482.57s -> 17527.86s]  shrines i'm not against it you better be on your best behavior you guys eat so much now oh crap
[17560.38s -> 17600.36s]  remember the blue smoke that's right i forgot in a little smoother i see something in the
[17600.36s -> 17627.86s]  distance no go vu wait it keeps moving oh fuck i forgot it keeps moving wait didn't it keep
[17627.86s -> 17637.58s]  moving remember wait last time it was like oh and it destroys everything you can't stop it
[17637.58s -> 17650.06s]  last time i got there it did it it went through it oh it's because i didn't go on the pad yeah

[17732.71s -> 17738.36s]  don't think i want to upgrade this again because they just kind of die when you have too many
[17738.36s -> 17744.33s]  somebody said earlier they don't think that i'm supposed to have this many out at one time
[17744.33s -> 17749.50s]  i feel that because i feel like when you get over seven or eight of them one of them just kind of
[17749.50s -> 17769.90s]  is a little too slow and gets a run over um hmm food one more time yeah pretty good
[17770.54s -> 17777.66s]  i mean there are a lot of crunchies here but i don't think it's necessary i think we're good
[17777.66s -> 17794.12s]  the projection shared a new recipe with a trebum which could protect them from the cruel light of
[17794.12s -> 17812.94s]  their enemies wheel body oh very very cool take some extra snacks take some snacks and get out

[18844.70s -> 18852.89s]  care about the egg right now i i i need to get the hell away from these things stat pronto
[18863.98s -> 18887.70s]  the vibes are going into the red yeah right now you guys are looking to the vibes meter
[18887.70s -> 18895.10s]  and you're not telling me you know you're not saying it you're not telling me but you're very
[18895.10s -> 18902.02s]  concerned right now because right now your screen is blinking red and all you hear in your ears is
[18902.02s -> 18941.70s]  really loud just kill me this is so far away i got a job interview tomorrow you should wrap it up
[18948.65s -> 18954.02s]  i hope you good luck i hope you do good i hope you get the job and everything or what's
[18954.10s -> 18960.18s]  something you like hope you get pretty decent income and everything but i have trevums to save
[18960.18s -> 18979.70s]  how the vibes are off on that one big time i should i swim across with i don't know i feel
[18979.70s -> 19052.54s]  like it's too far i don't know i feel like this is way too far to go it's already right up no he's
[19052.54s -> 19064.86s]  a faster one the problem is leaving the bubble i you have to leave it so far away i can't get a
[19064.86s -> 19071.85s]  good make sure to run to the blue smoke yeah but there's only one there's this one over here and
[19071.85s -> 19117.96s]  there's one more on the way i'm already fucking dead i might have to swim across
[19124.26s -> 19127.72s]  yeah i've no i there's no way i would have made that i think i have a swim
[19131.21s -> 19148.97s]  no i definitely wouldn't have made it who has swimming ability oh oh none of them do
[19149.85s -> 19154.34s]  because of the yellow light of course how could i have forgotten that's oh my bad
[19183.42s -> 19188.74s]  actually the vibes aren't even down i've accepted that the vibes i've accepted where the vibes are
[19188.74s -> 19201.38s]  and it's okay i'm actually in my vibes are pretty good right now yes i mean the vibes are turbulent
[19201.38s -> 19236.33s]  but then i wouldn't call them bad the vibes are turbulent not bad good tea well that's obviously
[19236.33s -> 19250.09s]  not working so i need a new strategy maybe all the way to the right but that's a long way to go
[19250.09s -> 19289.30s]  i'll try it i think that's like 50 longer i'll try it vibes are fine okay yeah let's go the vibes
[19289.30s -> 19295.85s]  are putrid like if you scoop the vibes up did they just kind of fall through your hands sludge
[19297.00s -> 19303.51s]  like just falling through your fingers you have to scoop it up scoop it up i don't think you can
[19303.51s -> 19310.92s]  get it all they smell yeah they smell terrible smell they smell rotten like rotten fucking food
[19310.92s -> 19339.93s]  why is this so much more difficult than every single other one the last 13 hours of gameplay
[19339.93s -> 19357.05s]  am i missing something here this has been the only one that's been this much of a pain in the ass
[19361.30s -> 19366.09s]  it's definitely left it has to be i was gonna skip the first blue
[19366.09s -> 19375.19s]  um smoke and just go up this corner here i telling you i think swimming is the way to do it i just
[19375.19s -> 19426.89s]  need swimming i feel like i could get over there fast enough this might be the one yeah i am so
[19426.89s -> 19437.61s]  far away it's not even close this is not even close what is going on right now it's not even
[19437.61s -> 19448.57s]  close this mechanic has happened like 40 times over the playthrough and this one i just can't do
[19448.57s -> 19460.68s]  it the only one i haven't been able to do use fast legs and regen i think i had that before but
[19461.69s -> 19472.46s]  no you know what i'm swimming across this shit watch this i'm swimming across this with with
[19472.46s -> 19495.78s]  fucking grappo all right grappo it's your time to shine do i have any of those things that make me
[19495.78s -> 19516.74s]  have a fish head i would look in here but it's gonna activate it let me just let me just test
[19516.74s -> 19537.98s]  this to see what this looks like i didn't mean to fall in here yeah i need the stamina who could
[19537.98s -> 19545.24s]  have done this first try if i had the stamina thing for the hmm i might have been able to
[19545.24s -> 19574.49s]  done it i might be able to do it if i had the stamina fish why is there a giant lake in the
[19574.49s -> 19584.10s]  middle i'm like just my brain is sitting here just thinking damn it why is there a lake in the middle
[19585.08s -> 19603.08s]  i mean it could be a small lake somebody's dead somebody died you have to go so far
[19603.08s -> 19627.99s]  parallel i just i'm gonna just find the fish really i'm just kind of banging my head against
[19627.99s -> 19667.94s]  a wall for no reason eat this and then eat that i want to look cool while i do it all right there's
[19667.94s -> 19675.26s]  no way there is no way that i do not go across i have infinite stamina and i have webbed feet
[19675.26s -> 19713.75s]  and i'm shiny as fuck i'm ready go on faster go faster this is not increased swimming speed
[19714.82s -> 19745.48s]  in fact i feel like it's slower swimming speed how is this faster somebody said please just roll
[19745.48s -> 19773.27s]  i i mean i've tried that like a fucking dozen times why is this one so much harder the vibes
[19773.27s -> 19788.38s]  that shouldn't take you out of rolling now that you that that's a bad one to get you just have to
[19788.38s -> 19804.20s]  cut across i saw the blue and i'm like should i get the blue no it's over my buddy eric is
[19804.20s -> 19824.71s]  disappointed well i'm disappointed that eric is disappointed how does that sound
[19825.77s -> 19909.14s]  how's that sound what are you doing i feel like i got caught on everything the physics of this
[19909.14s -> 19944.15s]  role is just so catchy and bouncy what the fuck i mean i made it but at what cost store them and
[19944.23s -> 19974.81s]  just do it alone we continue who died at last one of the creatures was walking around carelessly in
[19974.81s -> 19981.53s]  the corrupted plains of what was left of the world all the trevum needed to do was to steal
[19981.53s -> 19988.65s]  its core or more precisely the core it had stolen from whatever poor trefala it had eaten
[19988.65s -> 19993.69s]  yeah gunu's fine the creature it's okay slow and uninterested in the time does this have stealth
[19993.69s -> 20001.56s]  legs had a frightful layer of teeth protecting its prize could a nimble enough trevum snatch
[20001.56s -> 20012.23s]  that prize right out of its jaws all right gunu go in there with your default body your default
[20012.23s -> 20021.99s]  legs your default head who else we got we've got default default default i forgot that you had stuff
[20021.99s -> 20051.13s]  and i said i thought something was wrong with you default all right let's go well now we're gonna be
[20051.13s -> 20082.62s]  get away from me all right i'm just going in i'm going in and i'm just gonna suck it out this is
[20082.62s -> 20120.71s]  the play i just blow it over i wonder if i can just blow it up does anybody have to jump this is
[20120.71s -> 20157.56s]  definitely what it wants me to do now we wait 40 minutes for him to do a full entire revolution
[20157.56s -> 20212.06s]  around the whole place are you mad um nah nah i don't think so are you annoyed no not really
[20212.06s -> 20220.71s]  if i had a floaty thing i could go up there the floaty things over there did ever unlock the
[20220.71s -> 20231.30s]  floaty thing permanent upgrade i don't think so i don't believe i did but um it's right here
[20266.58s -> 20325.98s]  it's all right i got it oh joyous indeed the trevums found the weird liver that was inside
[20325.98s -> 20334.41s]  of the scary monster it seems they don't know exactly where they need to go maybe if the yellow
[20334.41s -> 20351.64s]  light came and took all their powers away they would find a new way right eat this as soon as
[20352.44s -> 20359.34s]  it kind of looks like a fucking dork to feel a call as if it was being drawn to some place nearby
[20360.34s -> 20369.86s]  it was now the master of song the master of song it's me voice to be heard it's time for gunu to
[20369.86s -> 20392.49s]  sing the song oh somebody's pissed off a memory awoke within the trebum of an ancient ritual
[20392.49s -> 20399.29s]  a song at the top of a trebum tower to forge a bond between trebum and
[20409.53s -> 20414.33s]  come back is it are you all right oh my god i just got sniped from across the whole game
[20415.82s -> 20438.95s]  what was that that thing jumped across the whole map jeez oh my goodness what is that huh i'm trying
[20438.95s -> 20464.39s]  to take over my fucking brain i was all right place your bets is it gonna be a yoshi story song
[20464.39s -> 20469.51s]  is it gonna be super funny and cute is it gonna be like i hope the top of this tower
[20470.15s -> 20476.79s]  right here in this place and with the proper mutation now was the time for the trebum
[20476.79s -> 20492.86s]  to sing who calls for us in this time of darkness who has learned the ancient song
[20494.06s -> 20503.77s]  have our old friends remember us here our voice trebum there is little time left and much is at
[20503.77s -> 20513.99s]  stake it was long ago that you will send to the heavens your song traveled far into the cosmos
[20513.99s -> 20523.82s]  and we listened here on your world we made a new begin the sorrows of our history
[20524.86s -> 20534.95s]  we began to the friendship and harmony but the beauty of your song pierced time and space
[20535.75s -> 20543.13s]  far into the darkest and coldest corners of the universe that's how the cylinder found us
[20544.42s -> 20559.46s]  and when it came from us the bright future we had dreamt of is gone but silence may be safer
[20559.46s -> 20567.50s]  but what is a life without song you reached out to the stars because you were full of hope
[20567.50s -> 20574.20s]  and that hope must be preserved we know what you are trying to accomplish
[20574.20s -> 20584.28s]  and we will help you your help to see me strike at the abomination and then meet me where only
[20584.28s -> 20595.19s]  shattered pieces are left of the evil that i haven't done i love oh they're like you're beautiful
[20595.19s -> 20649.67s]  song it was just me kind of going like for one second oh my god quick touch the brain
[20649.67s -> 20657.69s]  touch the brain everybody touch the brain you you can come to in fact you'd be the first one to
[20657.69s -> 20680.07s]  touch it in case it's poisoned we can break we can we can turn some of these crystals
[20695.32s -> 20704.76s]  and if we live be as shadows of our ancestors but when the cylinder streams spill into the world
[20704.76s -> 20712.33s]  the glimpse of hope tumbles out with them fragments of our past have fallen into this land
[20712.33s -> 20722.38s]  and only you can reclaim them using the cylinder in its eternal arrogance does not want to lose
[20722.38s -> 20729.42s]  what it has conquered so it has formed these strange alien heads to protect the fragments
[20730.84s -> 20735.72s]  soon it will wake from its slumber and reabsorb them oh half of us are dead
[20736.36s -> 20744.28s]  it's that let our memories become yours and then seek out two more that is all we require
[20744.28s -> 20752.79s]  two more enough for us to be remembered ourselves again do this for us and we shall
[20752.79s -> 20762.01s]  carry you to your path now go seek two more towers and call for our help and then all this will
[20762.01s -> 20772.66s]  find me do i eat this thing i'm gonna break it the voice urges them to go forward and reclaim
[20772.66s -> 20790.82s]  the memories of the triwala well given this to gunu for a while legs what does that do
[20791.54s -> 20813.38s]  okay look for water look for water you are dying of this hurry there's not much time
[20814.18s -> 20843.77s]  i drink poisonous water we're better to find out now i cannot well i mean i was standing in that
[20843.77s -> 20865.93s]  cut scene for a while that i got pretty fucking thirsty man um i think my character is passing
[20865.93s -> 20916.81s]  out look much easier this one is i have to get another one i see yellow light i get angry i see
[20916.81s -> 20927.48s]  yellow light i get angry and if you're gonna take the triwala power from me no you are not no you
[20927.48s -> 20983.34s]  aren't with this shit right now um what was that um i wonder if i can just get it and get out of
[20983.34s -> 21003.48s]  here no i can't i have to do it this is not going to be that bad as long as it's not on one of the
[21003.48s -> 21044.18s]  big cow ones that go those ones are awful what is it something over here that's fairly annoying
[21044.18s -> 21081.50s]  but i have a good spot okay goodbye pretty clean okay as that any items or anything
[21081.50s -> 21095.78s]  no okay now get me in there i need to eat this has to be the end of the game i would be i would
[21095.78s -> 21102.41s]  be shocked if after collecting whatever these two more things are there's no way there's one there
[21102.41s -> 21111.50s]  and one there are you enjoying the game i i am enjoying the game i do think it's dragging a
[21111.50s -> 21122.15s]  little it's dragging its feet a little here this this has got a yellow light on it okay
[21122.87s -> 21138.68s]  it's got it's filled with poison and has a yellow light all right wait i already i already have one
[21138.68s -> 21148.44s]  it's on my head right now i don't need another one i don't need another one no i definitely
[21148.44s -> 21173.40s]  don't need another one let's go i need to eat that's really important anybody have food just
[21173.40s -> 21179.98s]  gonna find the platform that makes okay never mind that makes this a lot easier then for some
[21179.98s -> 21186.78s]  reason i thought i had to attack kill and take it from two more people that's all right this
[21186.78s -> 21200.28s]  shouldn't be that much longer then i do want to go this way really kind of this is a shitty area
[21200.68s -> 21237.11s]  hmm there is an upgrade station but i don't even know if i want to do it i think i just want to go
[21237.11s -> 21255.02s]  just just do it yeah let's just get the hell out of here yeah what's going on with the stamina
[21255.02s -> 21260.50s]  i feel like some people have a lower stamina or something because the wheel is not full on some
[21260.50s -> 21297.51s]  characters does it take longer to recharge the second wheel i saw that okay there's one there
[21297.51s -> 21307.08s]  and there's one there is it actually gonna get me it's gonna kill somebody we have to move on
[21307.56s -> 21314.58s]  we have to go sorry groppo groppo's dead we have to sing the song now has the trebum reached this
[21314.58s -> 21326.34s]  new area they were glad to see two great no stop i stop talking to me i i know where i have to go
[21333.38s -> 21340.42s]  has the trebum reached this new area they were glad to see two great towers nearby
[21341.61s -> 21348.41s]  this was a fortunate turn of events as soon they would be able to fulfill their promise
[21349.05s -> 21356.41s]  to the triwala but something felt wrong there was something unnatural about these animals
[21357.53s -> 21363.77s]  could it be that the eternal cylinder was aware of the trebam's actions aware and was trying to
[21364.01s -> 21376.47s]  aware look at all this bullshit look at this they so badly want to remove this singing song helmet
[21376.47s -> 21382.95s]  from my head look at this they just like so badly want me to get this taken off so i have to go
[21382.95s -> 21390.87s]  in that monster's ass or whatever it is it's mouth i know i know the answer the answer to
[21390.87s -> 21410.22s]  this question is no i'm just gonna save scum all right well we'll get it we'll get another one
[21410.22s -> 21421.99s]  we got another one i got another one where am i god take it off i don't even care take it off
[21421.99s -> 21456.62s]  yeah take it off it doesn't matter i got another one up my sleeve sorry elevator's broken hello
[21472.65s -> 21485.51s]  staff are asking for a raise one of your staff has died the mighty triwala had been cast down
[21485.51s -> 21495.08s]  was this the end was all in vain so it seemed at first but a small crack had been opened
[21495.96s -> 21503.72s]  and a ray of light had escaped the darkness in a world where titans clashed and monsters battled
[21503.72s -> 21511.64s]  it was only the smallest and most unlikely of heroes who could make a difference gotta go in
[21511.64s -> 21538.18s]  there i want the triwala try again i think there's more than one i think there's like
[21538.74s -> 21544.30s]  a dozen or something i think it's like a whole entire species all right somebody has to float
[21544.30s -> 21551.72s]  up there who's still alive bowie bowie you are always my favorite don't let anybody tell you
[21551.72s -> 21597.05s]  differently look at how cute he is what's in here sometimes it is the actions of the tiniest of
[21597.05s -> 21605.53s]  creatures working together that can change the future when everything is broken they are the
[21605.53s -> 21636.66s]  only ones who can fit through the cracks yeah the trebum had fought this creature before and beaten
[21636.66s -> 21656.46s]  it they would do so again for themselves for the triwala and for the future for the guild
[21658.15s -> 21694.81s]  guru cannot die but what is happening i'm just gonna i don't know i can't move i can't move that
[21694.81s -> 21711.75s]  he's doing this stun move and now i'm gonna explode and kill my trebum allies dude do something i'm

[21752.07s -> 21758.81s]  i would never be able i wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror i'd be like you let you
[21759.61s -> 21767.40s]  sorry bastard be pointing into the mirror and say you let those trebums down and their world got
[21767.40s -> 21774.44s]  destroyed by the giant rolling pin and you could have stopped it but you didn't you let them all
[21774.44s -> 21786.12s]  die sorry not tonight not tonight the trebum had fought this creature before and beaten it
[21787.06s -> 21793.70s]  they would do so again for themselves for the triwala and for the future why did it just
[21793.70s -> 21826.78s]  delete it from my you gotta throw the red stones i fought this guy before but is way more irritating
[21826.78s -> 21831.35s]  in this room for some reason i'll pick up one of those crystals and it'll just disintegrate in my
[21831.35s -> 21848.23s]  hand vibe watchers skip this one it's a lost cause the trebum had fought this creature before and
[21848.23s -> 21856.31s]  beaten it they would do so again pick it up for the triwala oh my god i'm starting to think that
[21856.31s -> 21861.51s]  i don't care about the fucking triwala or the trebums anymore just roll the pin roll it over

[21957.82s -> 21976.38s]  it's no it's i feel like this is detrimental he can't even see dude you don't understand
[21977.74s -> 21982.06s]  if you were playing this right now you would be you would be saying holy shit this is
[21982.06s -> 21987.74s]  fucked up why i'm pressing a and it feels like i'm pressing b i'm pressing up and it feels like
[21987.74s -> 21991.34s]  i'm pressing down i'm telling you if you had the controller in your hand right now you'd be saying
[21991.34s -> 21996.28s]  the same shit you'd be saying the same stuff i'm telling you right now you would be sitting there
[21996.28s -> 22002.22s]  going yeah this is a fucking mess you i'm just uh you would be i'm saying to you you would be
[22002.22s -> 22014.63s]  let's just chill out all right let's hang out the trebum had fought this creature before and beaten
[22014.63s -> 22040.73s]  it they would do so again for themselves for the triwala and for the future oh my god please stop
[22040.81s -> 22061.51s]  that like so when he does that move the entire room pushes you around it also deletes if you
[22061.51s -> 22104.34s]  have one in your hand already this is uh you'll know what i mean by that
[22113.32s -> 22118.30s]  use the jump pads when i touch the jump pads i lose control of my character and he just spins
[22118.30s -> 22125.19s]  in the air i can't breathe in you just fucking fly in the air and have no control of the character
[22125.19s -> 22144.38s]  in a random random ass direction use the bombs it takes like 10 seconds to eat it and then it
[22144.38s -> 22163.16s]  takes 10 seconds to explode i think i'm do i just i just think it's not let's go trebum had fought
[22163.16s -> 22170.22s]  this creature before and beaten it they would do so again for themselves for the triwala
[22170.86s -> 22255.03s]  and for the future my eyes are itchy i'm trying as hard as i can right now oh fuck off there's no

[22671.32s -> 22678.86s]  of goo or whatever that was just disintegrated like a million years of history somebody in the
[22678.86s -> 22690.74s]  chat let's let's relax for a second um am i in trouble here do i have to rewind like 20 minutes

[22707.00s -> 22715.21s]  it'll fix itself all right all right okay okay thank goodness thank you you see you thought
[22715.21s -> 22723.85s]  sharing was caring you split it up between the three of you it was a mistake only one of you can
[22723.85s -> 22749.78s]  traverse the chihuahua gate all right let's go up here i need to eat yes i do we are so close
[22749.78s -> 22758.78s]  everybody we're there we're right there look at look at where we are here it's right here it's
[22758.78s -> 22767.80s]  over right there the palace there it is i keep seeing people saying tree tree tree why they why
[22767.80s -> 22782.90s]  you saying tree what why you saying tree tree the mutation tree you didn't wait yeah i have the
[22782.90s -> 22811.40s]  trunk on does i have three of them mutation true what did i unlock something the body um i don't
[22811.40s -> 22825.85s]  think i can you need to put the body on gunu oh no look look in the left side of the left corner
[22825.85s -> 22837.21s]  of the screen no we're good we're good i'm finishing this right now i enjoyed my time with
[22837.21s -> 22858.12s]  this game that's what i'm gonna say i enjoyed my time enjoyed my time a lot of it hey hey if we
[22858.12s -> 22863.58s]  didn't get this bar we wouldn't have seen gunu get sniped from across the game we made a lot
[22863.58s -> 22884.63s]  of memories i had a good time it was nice a little bit of it i was not the biggest fan of but
[22885.86s -> 22892.98s]  i think it's it's the style i think it's got a lot going for it i think just the world alone is
[22892.98s -> 22905.43s]  worth experiencing like a lot of the other ace team games but yes i do think the game could have
[22906.15s -> 22911.51s]  seen in mod chat right now the consensus seems to be i almost feel like the game should have been
[22911.51s -> 22919.46s]  yeah like two hours shorter i feel like this last part of go get the three things we we already got
[22919.46s -> 22926.34s]  the three things and it made us go get three more things at the end it's like i don't really
[22926.34s -> 22940.68s]  really want to go get three more things we already got the three things but is that a complaint or
[22940.68s -> 22946.02s]  is that a good thing because it's just more content more game more stuff to do i guess take
[22946.02s -> 22957.22s]  that as you will yeah the first half of the game was was phenomenal i loved every second of it
[22958.54s -> 22962.70s]  i think it's just once a lot of the power started to become stuff that you couldn't hold on to and
[22962.70s -> 22967.74s]  you needed to get the permanent stuff and go find items but finding items was kind of difficult
[22968.30s -> 22976.31s]  i think it got a little bloated at the like 70 mark nearby there was another structure
[22976.31s -> 22982.95s]  like the one they had used to summon the trawler in the depths of the frozen tundra and so the
[22982.95s -> 22993.99s]  trebum knew that the end was near but um everything we said so far i enjoyed it i enjoyed it
[22997.90s -> 23007.34s]  i think it's it's a really quirky really funny really interesting concept it was good do i think
[23007.34s -> 23025.78s]  it was great probably not but it was good oh wait a minute these are the only family members who
[23025.78s -> 23045.90s]  will travel to the palace we gotta go get we gotta go rescue people i don't know oh our friends i
[23045.90s -> 23079.08s]  don't even know if they're i don't think there is a revive thing here yeah we got gunu it's fine
[23079.08s -> 23081.40s]  so
[23081.40s -> 23089.24s]  all right everybody quiet big reveal time
[23158.47s -> 23189.75s]  is that using to us you are long bro saying to us of who we were days when the trellum
[23189.75s -> 23219.50s]  and the true well lived together under the same stars final boss maybe the evil
[23220.22s -> 23249.11s]  hey

[23353.80s -> 23406.78s]  get climbing up scrunchies just a little longer hang on come on gunu stay alive
[23408.38s -> 23420.94s]  you have to be the one that makes it you're the only one that can sing the other guy oh
[23421.10s -> 23453.26s]  oh no oh no they're all dead i'm dead full wipe was it scripted holy shit it's just me and you
[23453.26s -> 23489.35s]  who are you what's your name vogru of course of course it's vogru come on we gotta go it's a
[23489.35s -> 23522.66s]  person person camera tv it's just kind of a regular person thank you my young friends you
[23522.66s -> 23530.36s]  have accomplished what thousands of civilizations before you failed to you've shown that the cylinder
[23530.36s -> 23540.58s]  is imperfect it may not have lost the war but it certainly lost a battle and that's never happened
[23540.58s -> 23549.13s]  before there's so much more i wish i could tell you but there's not enough of me left
[23549.13s -> 23557.85s]  and i have one final goal so forgive me for inserting myself into your memories
[23558.81s -> 23561.85s]  and for having to leave them again so soon
[23588.31s -> 23618.10s]  see if there's anything else here hey eric if you're here yeah i just want to say that
[23618.10s -> 23663.19s]  like we're cool are we cool eric are we cool wait where's gunu right you're not going to go push
[23663.19s -> 23743.66s]  it again oh uh-huh look is everybody actually that's none of us i remember that one that one
[23743.66s -> 23796.17s]  was in it too oh look it's barney and guwug his dasher his daughter bluetooth i don't know one
[23796.17s -> 23810.82s]  in the back and so the trebum who were not the strongest nor the fastest and who did not have
[23810.82s -> 23819.62s]  sharp teeth escaped the eternal cylinder they did not become one but stubbornly stayed many
[23820.42s -> 23827.43s]  and they learned to be loyal not only to their own kind but to others their great victory over
[23827.43s -> 23835.66s]  the inevitable was the victory of generations of the elders and the trawler and my own people
[23836.52s -> 23844.34s]  whose name i cannot remember but even as what is left of me fades away and though one day the
[23844.34s -> 23852.89s]  cylinder may resume its destruction i know that i was part of this family if only for a little
[23852.89s -> 23862.22s]  while and that gives me hope humans made the cylinder it was like a fucking crazy awful
[23862.22s -> 23867.61s]  project very got two out of hand they started flattening planets they went to this place they
[23867.61s -> 23873.54s]  flattened this was somebody's planet and this human and uploaded himself into the cylinder
[23873.54s -> 23880.81s]  and he tried to he's trying to stop it he's the narrator the whole time and that's really cute
[23880.81s -> 23914.98s]  the humans always the humans i seen you beat a game for once uh i would definitely that's
[23914.98s -> 23928.14s]  gonna be way more that's gonna be happening way more frequently that third the the this kind of
[23928.14s -> 23936.47s]  third arc wasn't a huge huge fan of first arc was great second arc was great i think i just got a
[23936.47s -> 23945.11s]  little overwhelmed and confused and that yellow light that yellow light was just it's just yucky
[23945.11s -> 23975.75s]  it was good i i would play it again if if i didn't play it before i would play it and again i don't
[23975.75s -> 23981.58s]  want to criticize a million things here the permanent upgrade system really just felt
[23981.58s -> 23987.26s]  i just feel like it didn't even need to be there i wonder if the developers are really concerned
[23987.26s -> 23992.90s]  that if you found your favorite little friends and you gave them what they were you wanted to give
[23992.90s -> 24002.30s]  them that it would get boring because the idea is that you lose them and i was safe scumming so that
[24002.86s -> 24013.93s]  i was kind of messing with the intent but that was a fun i was solid i i am happy that i played it
[24013.93s -> 24020.44s]  let's put it that way forget about like the 30 or 40 minutes of frustrations i had like four or
[24020.44s -> 24028.02s]  five hours ago think about the first time i played it the second time i played it the whole package
[24029.08s -> 24042.55s]  was was just nice it was a nice game it was way more than 30 minutes what no it wasn't it was
[24042.55s -> 24056.89s]  like 30 it was like 45 maybe tops it was like a whole hour yeah but i mean it was two hours no
[24056.89s -> 24072.90s]  it wasn't yeah maybe it was like two hours but spread out over seven hours he hated it no i
[24072.90s -> 24084.46s]  really didn't i really didn't i promise i didn't so i have a question so were we inside of the
[24084.46s -> 24090.62s]  cylinder when we went into that mathematician's head because that was it kind of looked like it
[24090.62s -> 24104.47s]  right weird like maze the inside of the cylinder was a weird super maze that was the cylinder's
[24104.47s -> 24128.78s]  memories it looked like a maze on the back of a cereal box and well hey i will tell you i'm
[24128.78s -> 24147.83s]  going to play ace team's new game that new uh xeno clash game looks really really cool that's
[24147.83s -> 24155.80s]  going to wrap it up here i'm not going to give you a score i don't think i should i enjoyed the
[24155.80s -> 24163.90s]  experience it was better than a six it was better than a seven i'm not going to score it it was
[24163.90s -> 24170.49s]  lower than an eight it was better than a six but it was lower than an eight that's pretty much it
[24170.49s -> 24190.23s]  you just scored it well yeah that is true yes all right i did it's a seven whatever you'll figure
[24190.23s -> 24201.32s]  it out it's in that range you'll figure it out you can figure it out it's in that range music
[24201.32s -> 24208.82s]  was great art was great character designs are great it just dragged a little and it was it was
[24208.82s -> 24217.22s]  some of the game systems were a little confusing but hey that's your six to eight six dash eight
[24217.22s -> 24244.86s]  and that's what i'm gonna score it six dash eight i didn't say seven said six dash eight all right so
