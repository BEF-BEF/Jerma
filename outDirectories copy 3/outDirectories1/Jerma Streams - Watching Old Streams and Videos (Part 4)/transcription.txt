[0.95s -> 14.30s]  Hello. Good afternoon, good evening. Good to see you again. Welcome to an interesting stream.
[14.30s -> 21.59s]  This is going to be like, I don't like anything we've ever done before. Weird voice? What?
[23.03s -> 33.16s]  My effects aren't on. They shouldn't be on. Real voice? This, yeah, this is my real voice.
[33.16s -> 45.06s]  So what do you want me to tell you? I thought I had my sound effects on. You fixed it. Oh, I did?
[46.98s -> 58.36s]  Okay. Anyways, today we're going to do something different. This is the culmination of the last
[59.16s -> 69.82s]  16 hours of time. If you were not here a couple days ago, or not even like a day and a half ago,
[70.38s -> 78.18s]  we were talking about how funny it would be if there was a way for us to watch old videos.
[78.18s -> 86.46s]  You know, you've seen those streams before, right? Not only watch old videos, but all of them have
[86.46s -> 96.20s]  every single stream and every single video I've ever done be available to skip through. And what
[96.20s -> 108.36s]  would that even look like? What does my entire almost 10 year career look like? Did we just get
[108.36s -> 117.67s]  subs? Hold on. How many? Was that 10? Oh, shit. I don't even have my fucking thing ready. Yeah,
[117.67s -> 127.70s]  I said it like that. Career. And we can find out today. Because after talking about all that,
[127.70s -> 131.30s]  and hey, wouldn't it be funny if we could just like get a random timestamp and go through a
[131.30s -> 143.51s]  random video? Lazy Luke made it. Actually made this capable and possible. We are going to do
[143.51s -> 148.31s]  something very interesting today. Holy shit. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[148.31s -> 160.15s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't even have my
[160.15s -> 169.06s]  dashboard open. Hold on a second. I got like seven windows open. What just happened? Hold on. It's
[169.06s -> 178.47s]  loading. It's loading. It's loading. Oh, you know, Kazzy gave 10 community subs. Thank you, Kazzy,
[178.47s -> 187.98s]  for the 10 fucking community subs. And then thanks to Freddy Dread for the $500 in bits.
[188.62s -> 206.50s]  That's 50,000 bits. An absolute madman. Just a true madman. 500 bucks. Holy shit. And then great
[206.50s -> 211.54s]  Canadian FK Club, 10 community subs. Austin Atlantis, 10 community subs. It's just, it's the
[211.54s -> 219.80s]  hour of money. It's the money hour. He's going to turn into the fucking Monopoly man. I should
[219.80s -> 227.90s]  just start wearing a monocle. Do they even make those anymore? Can you buy a monocle? By the way,
[227.90s -> 233.24s]  isn't a monocle just a magnifying glass that you stick on your eye? Right? That's what it is.
[233.24s -> 237.58s]  The only people that use monocles are, are people that sell jewelry, like
[237.58s -> 245.02s]  diamonders, whatever they're called. Jeweler. That's it. Another 10 community subs from Labster.
[245.02s -> 250.14s]  Holy shit. All right. All right. We got, we got all, this is a lot of money. This is, this is too
[250.14s -> 257.19s]  much money. Uh, Freddy, Freddy, that's fucking insane. That's, that's 500 bucks right now.
[257.19s -> 263.93s]  Hey, hey, any, any, any diamonders in chat? Any diamonders? Am I loud today? I feel like I'm
[263.93s -> 272.09s]  loud today. Am I loud today? I feel like I'm wicked fucking loud. Is that better? Am I wicked? Am I
[272.09s -> 279.02s]  not wicked fucking loud anymore? Why am I this loud? I'm looking over at it. Hey, that, that,
[279.02s -> 284.33s]  that, that, that, that, that, that, that's better. That's not as insane as it was before. I'm always
[284.33s -> 292.86s]  quiet. Yeah. I'm always quiet, but now I'm always loud right now. All right. So, uh, thanks for these.
[296.22s -> 304.23s]  Yeah, that's a hundred. Oh my God. That's fucking so much money. That's a thousand dollars.
[306.60s -> 314.17s]  That, that's, wait, that's five. That's a thousand dollars, Freddy. Freddy. Freddy,
[314.17s -> 319.21s]  that's a lot of money. Freddy, you've given me like 10 grand, Freddy. Freddy, that's a shitload.
[320.01s -> 328.01s]  Holy shit, Freddy. A hundred more subs on top of the $500. I think Freddy Dread has given this
[328.01s -> 343.40s]  channel more than 10 grand. Holy shit. Wow. Freddy. And there's not even a message on this, on
[343.40s -> 354.46s]  the $500 donation. Not even a message. He's just like, boom, take this money. I will. Holy fuck.
[354.46s -> 364.31s]  It's your birthday. Well, it's not, but I can pretend it is. Anyway, I want to show you something
[364.31s -> 368.55s]  really, really, really fucking cool. So while we can, we can take a minute before we start this,
[369.29s -> 385.35s]  but take a look at this. This is my entire life, about 90% of my entire life. There's
[385.35s -> 396.52s]  3217 hours of videos and streams that is linked into here. This is every live stream I've ever
[396.52s -> 405.75s]  done and every video I've ever made. If you want to know what that looks like, take a look at this.
[405.75s -> 410.87s]  This page loads a random moment out of all German videos and streams. Although there are a lot of
[410.87s -> 415.51s]  main channel videos, they are unlikely to be played because they have such a compact duration.
[415.51s -> 428.09s]  And they do. Here's some statistics. Almost 1500 total videos, 778 archive streams and 712
[428.09s -> 437.96s]  main channel videos. So if you take a look at this, the, the amount of hours, most of the hours I've
[437.96s -> 445.03s]  ever spent on the internet have been from a stream. So when I press this button up here,
[445.03s -> 449.42s]  something very magical is going to happen. The first thing that's going to happen is it's going
[449.42s -> 460.02s]  to load a random fucking video and a random timestamp in that video across 3200 plus hours.
[460.02s -> 466.18s]  What also is going to happen is a timer is going to pop up in the top left corner of your screen.
[466.18s -> 470.30s]  That timer is going to count down from two minutes. It's going to start at two minutes.
[470.30s -> 478.15s]  When that timer reaches zero, it goes on to another random timestamp. So that's kind of
[478.15s -> 483.35s]  interesting in itself. But you know what else is interesting? If we started, maybe decided to play
[483.35s -> 496.92s]  a little bit of bingo too. This is over 10 years of my life on a bingo card. Now, after two minutes
[496.92s -> 502.94s]  goes by and we go to zero, we're going to go to a new random part of my entire life. How you come
[502.94s -> 511.59s]  into play on this stream. German, what are you going to do about channel points? Well, I'll tell
[511.59s -> 520.89s]  you. Today, if you would like to add 30 seconds to the timer that is in the top left corner of the
[520.89s -> 528.42s]  screen, you are going to give 10,000 channel points as a highlighted message. We had to do it
[528.42s -> 534.25s]  as a highlighted message. That's why highlighted messages are not here right now. We had to do it
[534.25s -> 540.82s]  as highlighted message because that's the only way that the website can pull the data that we need.
[540.82s -> 550.70s]  So 10,000 channel points will add automatically 30 seconds onto the timer. But 10k is too little
[550.70s -> 556.38s]  for that. I know, I know. It might be way too little, but here's the thing. I'd rather adjust
[556.38s -> 560.14s]  up than adjust down because if it's, if I started like 30,000 channel points,
[561.75s -> 567.54s]  and then like in 20 minutes we bring it down, I would have scammed a shitload of people.
[567.54s -> 580.86s]  We're going to find out. So we're going to play bingo and we're going to, it's not active yet
[580.86s -> 586.01s]  because I know people are just going to be like, oh, give 10,000 channel points right now. So it's
[586.01s -> 591.06s]  not active until I, I'm going to press this fucking button. We're going to get started and then I'm
[591.06s -> 600.52s]  going to turn it on. Remember the goal is, the goal is if you want to extend the current video
[600.52s -> 606.46s]  that is playing, this is not like, oh, we're, I mean, you technically are extending the stream,
[606.46s -> 616.68s]  but it's for the current video. Every video starts at 120 seconds. If you give 10,000 channel points
[616.68s -> 621.46s]  during that period, it's going to go up 30 seconds. When it reaches zero, we go to a new video.
[621.46s -> 629.93s]  I, let's, let's just go, but get a good screenshot of this because I'm going to need you guys help
[629.93s -> 642.57s]  for this one. Yeah. Get a good screenshot of that because I have to keep track of this too.
[642.57s -> 650.07s]  You ready? Are we ready to do this? Are we ready to start? I'm going to turn it on. Remember,
[650.07s -> 656.78s]  it has to be a highlighted message. Make sure your highlighted messages stay, stay. I'm looking
[656.78s -> 659.34s]  forward to this. I don't even know what the fuck, you could get anything. We could get fucking
[659.34s -> 665.51s]  anything from 10 years. Are you ready for me to press the button? It has to be a highlighted
[665.51s -> 675.08s]  message. I'm going to press the fucking button. Are you ready? Let's go. It begins in five, four,
[675.08s -> 687.64s]  three, two, wait, hold on. Okay. Hold on. I had to, I had to get the, the, okay. Ready?
[688.63s -> 696.50s]  In five, I have to be able to see this shit in five, four, three, two, roll the fucking dice.
[696.50s -> 702.14s]  Here we go. Welcome to the stream everybody. If there's anything, Nancy Drew, just let me know.
[702.70s -> 710.30s]  Thanks. I might just take you up on that offer. So what can I do for you? Tell me about,
[711.02s -> 723.98s]  tell me about Paseo Del Mar High. No, no, no, no, no. Oh my God. One of the students was
[723.98s -> 729.82s]  murdered in the school last week. We're all pretending to be students. No, no, stop, stop,
[729.82s -> 733.66s]  stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm going to make it more expensive. I'm going to make it more
[733.66s -> 736.06s]  expensive. All right. I'm going to turn it off. I'm going to turn it off. I'm going to make it more
[736.06s -> 738.06s]  expensive.
[764.47s -> 766.47s]  Ten thousand is too small. Ten thousand is too small.
[767.59s -> 769.59s]  Ten thousand is too small.
[783.24s -> 791.00s]  How long is this? This is just two hours. There's not even two hours in this VOD.
[791.00s -> 797.08s]  I can't play barnacle blast. Are you serious? That's a shame. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[797.48s -> 809.38s]  God damn it. Oh, you got to be shitting me. That makes a cool song. Let's find,
[809.38s -> 813.94s]  let's find our uncle. This is the most boring one. This is the most boring stream
[813.94s -> 821.24s]  of all the Nancy Drew streams. I can't refund bits. I can't fucking refund anything.
[828.20s -> 831.56s]  Oh my God. I should have fucking killed it so much further ago.
[835.48s -> 840.84s]  So what do you got for me? Well, I was hoping you could debrief me on the investigation.
[841.56s -> 848.12s]  Oh, sure, sure, sure. I'm just a bit. Well, my undercover assignments are usually not so
[849.32s -> 853.96s]  suburban. I can't believe it. I understand. I can't believe it. All right. Wait a minute.
[853.96s -> 858.20s]  I have a night. Oh, I fucking should have said this. The students know about any enemies.
[858.20s -> 861.96s]  All right. Listen to me. Listen to me. Nothing came up from searching his home computer,
[861.96s -> 867.80s]  cell phone or locker. I get a veto. I get three veto sneezes. I get three veto sneezes.
[869.24s -> 875.08s]  We suspect he was involved in something shady. Drugs, gambling or blackmail. That's where you
[875.08s -> 877.88s]  fit in. I can't fucking believe this is going to be two hours. See what you can find out.
[878.60s -> 882.92s]  We think he might have kept information about his activities in a notebook or journal. So
[882.92s -> 890.36s]  keep a lookout for anything like that. Anything else? Oh, 10,000 might be too much. 10,000 might
[890.36s -> 896.44s]  be too much. And it had to be Nancy Drew. Of course it starts with Nancy Drew. And all of
[896.44s -> 901.80s]  these fucking Drew motherfuckers over here have been waiting for this shit for weeks,
[901.80s -> 910.44s]  for actual weeks. And they got their opportunity right now. By the way, we got to pay attention
[910.44s -> 925.75s]  because there's a bingo card. What? What? Okay. I got to pay attention. I'm just going golf club.
[925.75s -> 939.35s]  Surf club is cool. That's cool. It's the locker. All right. Uh, I don't know this information yet.
[940.71s -> 947.80s]  All right. The gym. This is unbelievable. I'm coming.
[949.48s -> 953.32s]  Add something that's subtract. Oh, we don't, we don't wait. We don't have the capability for
[953.32s -> 962.31s]  that right now. We just started it. Sneeze and vid. Unroy. All right. What is that for?
[970.87s -> 977.56s]  Translate them into links instead. Like 10,000. I can't. No. Okay. For a second,
[977.56s -> 983.46s]  I thought that their mascot was a sock with boxing gloves. Is that, is that, wait, is that,
[983.46s -> 988.73s]  is that anything? Was that something on the bingo card? Check the bingo card.
[989.37s -> 997.69s]  All right. If, by the way, it's going up to 20,000 channel points. Grape, orange, soda, cool,
[997.69s -> 1008.49s]  or spot cola. I would love to have a sip of cool cola. That's 20,000 channel points. It's probably
[1008.49s -> 1016.97s]  a puzzle. Spot cola, cool soda, orange soda. I am so angry right now, but it's like hilarious.
[1019.72s -> 1026.26s]  I need, I need more quarters. It's guys. It's already been like, how long has it been?
[1027.70s -> 1034.10s]  How long is this actually? Holy shit. You just kind of new girl at school. Do you realize what
[1034.10s -> 1040.18s]  destiny has brought you today? Yours truly Hector Sanchez, but you can just call me the Hulk. It's
[1040.18s -> 1046.18s]  an hour and 40 minutes. The Hulk? You are new around here. I play for the manatees,
[1046.18s -> 1051.46s]  one of the best teams in the state. I leave the others in the dirt, man. Soon it's college ball
[1051.46s -> 1056.74s]  and then the pros show time. That's not, no, surprise face. Who are the manatees?
[1057.46s -> 1062.10s]  Paseo Del Mar's mascot is a manatee. That's only in the video that we're watching. It had to be
[1062.10s -> 1066.18s]  fucking Nancy Scott. I know what to do if I come across a manatee. Why would you immediately talk
[1066.18s -> 1070.10s]  about fighting, punch one and hurt one? Here's the worst part. I can't even
[1070.18s -> 1074.98s]  I'm not going to pause. I know what to do if I come across a manatee. It's yeah. Just
[1074.98s -> 1080.34s]  it's like a zero point zero zero two percent. These are a great team at a great school.
[1080.34s -> 1086.02s]  Everyone is cool. It's like a zero point zero two percent chance to get Nancy Drew first.
[1086.02s -> 1092.97s]  I knew Jake, but I didn't hang out with him. Sorry. Can't talk now. I got to go to practice
[1092.97s -> 1105.69s]  later. At this point, I could let I could just like go take a shower and come back who died.
[1106.90s -> 1111.62s]  I could go take a shower. Yeah, this school is pretty cool. Jake Robert, Jake Robert sucks.
[1111.62s -> 1118.90s]  I hate him. Oh, OK. You know, he he's dead. Oh, yeah. Well, welcome to the school.
[1118.90s -> 1125.48s]  Is that is that an impression? No, it's not. How's it going? How could I get into Jake's locker?
[1126.04s -> 1130.60s]  I could tear the door off with my teeth, but it just might be easier to ask how to knock it.
[1130.60s -> 1134.36s]  His locker was right. This is the worst Nancy Drew stream, by the way. Oh, this is so bad.
[1134.36s -> 1139.64s]  Tell me about Daryl Gray. He seems like a cool guy. His family used to sponsor the annual
[1139.64s -> 1143.96s]  football awards dinner until last year. You know, he's the one who found Jake's body.
[1144.52s -> 1153.96s]  Wait, what? Hold on. Vito Vito lost right now. But what if what if it happens again immediately?
[1153.96s -> 1158.28s]  He knows that he's OK. I'm so scared. If I veto this, what if we get Nancy Drew again?
[1159.40s -> 1165.54s]  He talked about how much he's like he sucks. And now he's like, oh, yeah, that's where the body was.
[1170.25s -> 1176.25s]  I'll talk to you later. That's a finance. Yeah, this is a psychopath. Just one veto like checked
[1176.25s -> 1181.13s]  every box of are you make it max out at 10 minutes? All right, we're going to find where's this?
[1182.89s -> 1194.25s]  In the trash. I test. I wasn't prepared for this. I'll do it for this to happen. 10 minute max.
[1195.66s -> 1207.59s]  I'll do the eye test and see how good I do. Oh, where is it? That's that's a surprise face, Kim.
[1213.16s -> 1225.51s]  E, V, I, F, O, R, E, Z, E, E, R, H, T, E, G, I can't get over this. P, K, O, O, B, Y,
[1228.01s -> 1250.50s]  R, T, C, Z, M, N, J, K, O, O, L, K, M, O, T, E, M. I don't know. B, F, F,
[1250.82s -> 1264.60s]  A, L, E, E, U, L, K, Y. Boomer eyesight. K, A, P, I. All right, I have an idea. Should we add
[1265.85s -> 1272.49s]  like a hundred thousand channel points to skip? No, no, we can't do that. No, no, no, no, no,
[1272.49s -> 1277.05s]  we can't do that. You know, OK, when you when you go, OK, Jeremy, please cover one eye and do it
[1277.05s -> 1281.93s]  and you do it and then it's like, oh, do the other eye. And it's like, that's too many. But I can't.
[1281.93s -> 1283.69s]  It's all blurry. You can't. You can only do this once.
[1286.68s -> 1291.24s]  You actually can only do that test one time. You can't do the other eye to reduce time.
[1292.36s -> 1297.32s]  We did it. We don't have that set up for today. You got about half of that wrong. Ten minute max.
[1297.32s -> 1304.12s]  All right. What how what has it been so far? We're keeping right away. We're keeping track
[1304.12s -> 1308.84s]  of everybody. It's the that it's the light coming back into your eye. It's like all blurry.
[1308.84s -> 1312.36s]  We're keeping track of every every single highlighted point. What are you talking about?
[1312.36s -> 1318.52s]  So can a mod right now message me how many channel points, how many people highlighted
[1318.52s -> 1326.42s]  messages? What are you talking about? I'm fine. All right. I get I get three vetoes.
[1327.78s -> 1332.26s]  I forgot to say that I actually was going to say that I get three vetoes. When I cover one eye
[1332.26s -> 1337.22s]  and I cover one eye for long enough and I take my hand off that eye and I cover it, it's like
[1337.22s -> 1344.28s]  this eye that it was covered is all fucked up. Bro, don't you have a hernia? Yeah, it sucks.
[1346.57s -> 1355.26s]  You fucking liar. Then veto it. But I don't do I want to drink. All right. Do I want to use it,
[1355.26s -> 1361.35s]  though? That's the problem. This stream could be more than five to ten hours long. Do I want
[1361.35s -> 1368.87s]  to veto this right now at the beginning? You know what I'm saying? How do I get the hell out of here?
[1368.87s -> 1377.48s]  All right. Drink. But what if I want a I wish I could cool soda or should I get extra pop?
[1377.48s -> 1381.08s]  I'm going to do I have to use a video. Definitely. I think I have to use a video.
[1382.41s -> 1387.37s]  I'm going to use a video. I'm going to I this is this like this this this stream is so boring.
[1387.37s -> 1393.30s]  Like you don't want to watch this one. That is wasted quarter. All right. We're going to talk
[1393.30s -> 1404.66s]  to this walker. All right. All right. I'm sorry. I can't sit here for Nancy Trump for two hours.
[1404.66s -> 1421.18s]  I can't never exhaust. I can't do it. Regret. I'm vetoing Da Vinci. Bree Bree to one veto.
[1421.18s -> 1426.95s]  What is this murderous pursuits? Do a 10 minute stream delay.
[1428.95s -> 1433.99s]  Oh, this is like a multiplayer game. Field cart doesn't stream. I don't think anybody's stream
[1433.99s -> 1439.48s]  sniping. I don't. I remember this game. I haven't really seen that much evidence that it's happening.
[1441.06s -> 1446.82s]  Maybe it is, but there's no way I can avoid that. I'm not going to do a stream delay.
[1448.07s -> 1450.87s]  You want to turn on like a three minute stream delay.
[1450.87s -> 1457.61s]  Hey, how many seconds is 10 minutes? I can do that at this point. You only get one veto.
[1457.61s -> 1463.56s]  No, I get three. Hey, I'm still playing it though. Like I still am enjoying it.
[1465.00s -> 1468.52s]  All right. You guys seriously like you. It's called Presto Magesto. I'm not going
[1468.52s -> 1480.97s]  to use another veto. I have two more. Oh, my stomach is eating me alive.
[1483.64s -> 1487.78s]  Keep your eye on the bingo card. That's important. I don't even know if I can do that
[1487.78s -> 1495.14s]  being live. I think I have to set that before I start streaming. That's all right. Come at me.
[1495.14s -> 1505.77s]  I really don't think it's going to be that big of a deal. 30 seconds is too much.
[1506.41s -> 1513.77s]  Tell us about the Boston accent. I have two more vetoes. I have to get this right.
[1514.73s -> 1518.25s]  Thanks for the game, Jerma. And sorry about the circling. Your chat made me do it.
[1518.25s -> 1529.45s]  Wait, so somebody was in that game. Make it 10 seconds. What do you mean chat made me do it?
[1531.64s -> 1544.14s]  No, I think we're good. Yeah, I have to restart the stream for delay. Do I have anything
[1544.14s -> 1548.36s]  necessarily planned for the rest of the night? No, I mean, there are a couple of options, but
[1548.36s -> 1554.04s]  I'm having like a lot of problems right now with my stomach. This is the second time I've talked
[1554.04s -> 1561.62s]  about like medical issues in two roles. Don't take this the wrong way, but you seem very silly.
[1562.26s -> 1568.28s]  I should have put that up here. That's all right. I think I'm nice. I'm stuck here, I think.
[1569.16s -> 1582.65s]  What am I in queue? What am I waiting for here? I'm ready. Yeah, my stomach is like in a knot
[1582.65s -> 1594.38s]  right now. Make it one. I am just drinking water and we're good. But we got a lot of fun stuff
[1594.38s -> 1600.15s]  going on this weekend. So is this the end of a stream? What am I talking like? I'll eat my
[1600.15s -> 1607.10s]  stomach. What are you five grow a pear? Oh my God. What is happening right now? This is like
[1607.10s -> 1621.03s]  the middle of a stream. Jesus. Oh my God. That's inappropriate reading of chat. Tell me how you
[1621.03s -> 1630.63s]  really feel. Hunter. It's not that guy. It has to be that guy. I just blew the cool down. That is
[1630.63s -> 1639.64s]  inappropriate. Okay, where is that? Inappropriate chat reading. Where? Oh. As they like to opine on
[1639.64s -> 1646.36s]  the back streets of Limehouse. Floor below. They don't like it up, do they? All right, let's take
[1646.36s -> 1650.44s]  a look at what it looks like right now. All right, I'm going to try to actually win this one. Let's
[1650.44s -> 1656.52s]  go for it. Actually blind. No, that doesn't count for this. Take a look at what we got so far.
[1657.32s -> 1670.54s]  Now you guys have me paranoid for stream snipers. I got to go all the way around. I'll put the
[1670.54s -> 1676.74s]  webcam on so you can tell who the real one is. No, but this just looks like I'm on the same stream.
[1678.74s -> 1681.94s]  Floor below. I'm going to run right into them, I think, if I turn this corner.
[1682.74s -> 1688.06s]  I could just go like this. Hunter nearby. I really thought you would have come upstairs by now.
[1689.70s -> 1699.45s]  We got to hide. Damn. Is this like the ship? It is like a combination of it's not isn't the ship
[1699.45s -> 1705.29s]  like you talk like text to speech and shit. This is more the Assassin's Creed multiplayer
[1706.09s -> 1721.08s]  from. I need to get down the stairs. Keep doing it. Person is at one of the dinner tables.
[1721.96s -> 1727.40s]  Let's get a good look. It's the lady writer.
[1734.86s -> 1743.18s]  Where's my Hunter? Where's my Hunter? Where's my Hunter? Hunter right behind me.
[1744.14s -> 1752.68s]  Yep. Sayonara. Those who hesitate are lost. We got we need brass knuckles or we need a different
[1752.68s -> 1762.90s]  weapon. We only got 10 more. Don't say anything. There's a delay. Hunter's near. Shouldn't be. Nope,
[1762.90s -> 1768.97s]  right here. God damn it. I wasn't going to do it in time apparently. You heard those clicks.
[1769.93s -> 1775.45s]  You heard those clicks first place. Serious business. Damn it. That's not angry. I was
[1775.53s -> 1778.49s]  going like tickety tickety tickety tickety tickety. You know I was going tickety and it didn't
[1778.49s -> 1785.59s]  matter. No, that doesn't count. That's not the fucking ping. What's my ping? Well, they did
[1785.59s -> 1794.82s]  manage to get in first. 102 ping. That guy had zero. This guy's got zero ping. That's not. No,
[1794.82s -> 1801.21s]  it's not. There we go. That's not molding. Molding is way different than this. Not even close.
[1801.85s -> 1807.91s]  Yeah, I'm gonna take a gamble here. I know it. Yeah. Sometimes your intuition pays off.
[1808.79s -> 1815.99s]  Most inspirational. Why is a TF2 video on the board? Well, that's because there's a 3.4% chance.
[1815.99s -> 1823.62s]  It's like the line. There's a 3.4% chance to get a German 985 video and a 1.2% chance to get a
[1823.62s -> 1832.12s]  Team Fortress 2 video. And that disguise on, that's fine. But those of you that are confused,
[1832.12s -> 1836.36s]  let me turn it down a little bit. For those of you that are confused, this is pulling a random
[1836.36s -> 1842.20s]  timestamp from every single video and every stream I have ever done. For those of you that
[1842.20s -> 1851.45s]  are confused. So when we get to zero, or if I veto, it goes to a random timestamp of a random
[1851.45s -> 1857.37s]  thing I've ever done on the internet. And the first two we got have been very, very exciting.
[1858.01s -> 1864.49s]  It's been Nancy Drew's stream, which I had to veto. And then arguably one of the most probably
[1864.49s -> 1870.22s]  boring streams I've done in five years, which is this. Oh shit. Man, thanks for the stun.
[1872.33s -> 1879.61s]  Appreciate it. That person was a player the whole time. Hunter is near. That wasn't a
[1879.61s -> 1890.94s]  tuber voice. This guy right here. Definitely. Yep. No, that's to be distinct. Oh my God. Oh my God.
[1890.94s -> 1898.95s]  That's not a strange noise. No, that's just, is that a strange noise? No, no, it's not.
[1898.95s -> 1909.96s]  Was it a weird noise? What was this guy doing? That was me going like, ah. He's on a fucking rampage.
[1912.30s -> 1921.70s]  I gotta hide. I need a thing. I'm exposed. I'm exposed. Where are they? Lady right here?
[1922.58s -> 1929.14s]  No, that was a rumor. That was a rumor now. That was a rumor right now. Like in here. That wasn't
[1929.14s -> 1934.49s]  in the, oh shit, I gotta mute the microphone so you can't hear me. You're doing all right. I have
[1934.49s -> 1942.44s]  to get out of here. Fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Where are they? Just be in this. Oh, you were in the
[1942.44s -> 1954.26s]  circle. You were inside the circle. I ran right into the circle. Of course it was me. All right,
[1954.26s -> 1957.54s]  don't blow it. I got a commanding lead in the first place. Come back. We don't want to hear
[1957.54s -> 1968.63s]  this boring vlog. Well, why did you spend so much money to keep it here? There is a 0.04% chance for
[1968.63s -> 1977.54s]  you to get one of the Shmee videos. Don't you want to let this play out? When you see somebody
[1977.54s -> 1988.92s]  turn a corner there, I'm just going to activate it. I'm not going to veto this. Give me that weapon.
[1988.92s -> 2006.94s]  I want full exposure here. This is not, that's not. Tapping of running around. They're coming up
[2006.94s -> 2022.38s]  the stairs now. This pod is so boring. I'm going to activate my. This whole vod is just me going
[2022.38s -> 2033.94s]  like, okay. Got that guy. All right. If I attack that guy, walk around, hit this guy. Got him.
[2035.06s -> 2038.82s]  Got this guy. I'm not sure if I should have done that. Should I do that? Where's this guy?
[2039.46s -> 2046.22s]  I'm not sure. On the same floor. Pick this up. Okay. I think I'm still that person's target.
[2046.22s -> 2052.14s]  Question. Question. Question. Say question. Hey, question. Question. Did I get that guy?
[2053.10s -> 2057.34s]  Did I kill that guy? Should I go this way? What's up there?
[2071.88s -> 2075.16s]  Yeah, that was, that was, that was a Jeremy and I've learned to not be Jeremy.
[2076.20s -> 2079.64s]  I'm doing a different approach. He's laughing at his own jokes. He thinks it's so fucking funny.
[2080.28s -> 2090.42s]  Oh, this is the worst stream of 2020. This, this, this stream was like 2015. So sorry.
[2090.42s -> 2111.93s]  We can't pull a stream from 2015 and make it worse than 2020. The first person that walks
[2111.93s -> 2121.27s]  in this door is my killer. The most improved streamer award. I can't be just complacent about
[2121.27s -> 2126.79s]  this. Five minutes. All right. What is five minutes in, in, in time? Three, what is it? 320?
[2126.79s -> 2133.34s]  How many seconds is five minutes? They are right down here. 300. Shit. I gotta make something
[2133.34s -> 2146.79s]  happen right now. One minute left. 320. 350. How many seconds is five minutes? 300. Shit.
[2150.36s -> 2156.76s]  Okay. All right. We'll keep it. We'll make it 300 seconds. When it gets to 300 seconds,
[2156.76s -> 2160.68s]  then you've maxed it out. All right. Here's the thing though. Some of you guys are going
[2160.68s -> 2169.59s]  to be pretty upset by this. All right. All right. 300 seconds is the back. I gotta get one person.
[2171.83s -> 2186.12s]  When you hit 300 seconds, it triggers it. It triggers the fucking kill swing. What the fuck?
[2192.39s -> 2196.39s]  10 minutes is better. All right. If you want five minutes, press one. If you want 10 minutes,
[2196.39s -> 2209.59s]  press two. So I can't hit that guy. What the? I got it. I had it. That was mine. That was me.
[2210.62s -> 2214.94s]  Oh my god. Five minutes it is. At 300 seconds, you're going to trip it.
[2216.54s -> 2224.58s]  I can do this. I can control this. Don't worry. All right. Well now for future. I didn't know that.
[2224.58s -> 2229.86s]  Like I thought that even if they're getting arrested. Okay. So here we go. Because then I'm
[2229.86s -> 2236.30s]  technically still their quarry, right? Every single one is going to get to 300. Well,
[2236.30s -> 2240.52s]  you don't know that. I thought that even if they get arrested, like I can go up and hit them
[2240.52s -> 2246.34s]  because that it's like they got stunned. No, the stream is this, this like what we're watching
[2246.34s -> 2258.25s]  right now. What a bunch of dog shit. Wait, the guard. Yeah. Get the fucking guards out of the
[2258.25s -> 2281.66s]  game. Pointless. Mad. Oh, like what, what purpose do the guards serve? I don't see a purpose for
[2281.66s -> 2299.74s]  the guards. I don't. I'm just silent right now. That's how you can tell when I'm actually upset
[2299.74s -> 2304.94s]  about something. When I just sit there and I just sit there quiet.
[2305.82s -> 2311.66s]  For more than 20 to 30 straight seconds. Okay. So if a guard is like essentially stun somebody,
[2312.84s -> 2318.20s]  I'm technically still their quarry. So we haven't changed in five years. I don't know who it is and
[2318.20s -> 2326.38s]  I have to just hope I click first. You guys have been the same for the last decade. It's been more
[2326.38s -> 2331.26s]  than 300 seconds. If the counter is in the game, the guard seems like the most meaningless addition.
[2332.38s -> 2338.97s]  No, because people are going to count that as a veto. Wait, where's my one? What? Oh,
[2338.97s -> 2342.55s]  okay. That's not my mouse. That's, that's, that's his mouse. People are going to,
[2342.55s -> 2348.84s]  people are going to come back and count this as a veto. No one's going to count this as a veto.
[2348.84s -> 2368.98s]  You sure? Here we go. She's ready to go on a date. Let's get this right. The ego maniac stream.
[2368.98s -> 2372.98s]  Bridget has a dog named beefcakes, whom she loves more than anything else in the world.
[2374.63s -> 2379.83s]  Beefcakes is a presumptuous pet. He is fond of removing pieces of your body that he presumes
[2379.83s -> 2385.02s]  to be of no use. Well, now you've capped it out. These have included on various occasions, pieces
[2385.02s -> 2392.38s]  of arm, leg, toe, whatever happens to fall into his cavernous jaws. Bridget is thankful that beefcake
[2392.38s -> 2401.85s]  likes you so. What do you think about this? I should keep quiet. If it ever came down to a
[2401.85s -> 2407.05s]  choice between me and beefcakes, I would be the one in the dog house. I'm going to poison that
[2407.05s -> 2413.11s]  animal one day. It's just a matter of time. I'm going to ask that beefcakes be kept in another
[2413.11s -> 2422.31s]  part of the house while I am visiting. Why? These are so extreme. I'm going to poison. I'm
[2422.31s -> 2427.11s]  saying this to her. These are spoilers. But watch the stream from two years ago. It's a matter of
[2427.11s -> 2433.42s]  time. Why would I say that? Can you guys still read that? Is that still legible? Like, can you
[2433.42s -> 2439.53s]  still read this? No, be quiet. Wimp. By the time the two of you get serious, you may be missing
[2439.53s -> 2444.65s]  one of your most valuable parts. What the fuck? You wanted me to say that I was going to poison
[2444.65s -> 2456.42s]  your dog? This is like mad again. No, what? Veto the spoilers. While on a date with Bridget,
[2456.42s -> 2461.90s]  you've discovered that you've forgotten your wallet. What will you do? No, be quiet. All right,
[2461.90s -> 2466.55s]  I'm out of here. Excuse yourself. Tell the story to the restaurant owner and ask if he will give
[2466.55s -> 2475.43s]  you an IOU. Excuse yourself. Drive home or to the bank. Get money and come back. Ever think of
[2475.43s -> 2480.39s]  trying out for the Olympic Decathlon? It's only a few more events than you've had to perform tonight.
[2481.03s -> 2485.11s]  Bridget gets a bit suspicious when she notices that the car is parked in a different spot.
[2486.39s -> 2491.27s]  I'm surprised that in three streams we have no... Your chest heaving while you try to catch your
[2491.27s -> 2498.90s]  breath is very romantic. We have no look at me, which is kind of odd. Can I get something to go
[2498.90s -> 2504.92s]  right here romantically? Is that wrong? Bridget admits that every so often when the two of you
[2504.92s -> 2510.68s]  are being romantic, she makes believe that you are a famous movie star. How do you feel about this?
[2511.24s -> 2519.03s]  No, that doesn't count. I have to do it. That's fine. Does that count? That's okay. That's fine.
[2519.03s -> 2523.51s]  Can you date me? Can we go steady? Can you be my wife now? Actually, this is quite a common way
[2523.51s -> 2527.11s]  for people, both men and women, to add variety to their relationships. The ultimate in recycling
[2527.11s -> 2532.23s]  content. I'm glad you were open enough to accept it. Now what if I told you that the name of the
[2532.23s -> 2538.15s]  famous movie star is Flipper? I'm just kidding. No, I'm just kidding. That would be fucked up.
[2538.87s -> 2548.25s]  All right. Another good date. Here we go. Can this stream be on the random video player?
[2549.53s -> 2554.74s]  I don't think so. The two of you are very cozy. Bridget begins to get very romantic
[2555.46s -> 2560.42s]  and respond in kind. She explains that she would really like to make love with you but doesn't have
[2560.42s -> 2567.30s]  any birth control. What will you do? Suggest that you satisfy each other without intercourse. By the
[2567.30s -> 2573.30s]  way, if we filled out this drug store, is she going to be mad about me driving and is the car
[2573.30s -> 2591.42s]  going to be parked in a different place? Dude, I'm going to get fucking flagged for this shit.
[2594.78s -> 2601.29s]  After 35 minutes of searching, you finally find a drug store that is open late. Laughing fit? No,
[2601.29s -> 2605.05s]  no, no. Laughing fit has to be like- You purchased the condom and rushed back to Bridget's house.
[2605.05s -> 2607.69s]  She's falling asleep in the living room and does not answer the door.
[2608.65s -> 2618.30s]  Fucking god damn it. Don't you work at the drug store? Here we go. We're about to move.
[2619.82s -> 2625.50s]  We're moving. As often happens in relationships, Bridget begins to gain access to your personal life.
[2626.14s -> 2633.82s]  Want to know what she finds out? Yeah, what is it? She finds out that you still play with toy boats
[2633.82s -> 2642.14s]  when you sit in the bathtub. Now that's personal. Does she know about the real boat that's in the
[2642.22s -> 2647.58s]  bay? Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,
[2647.58s -> 2653.32s]  toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. Stick that into my gut, aren't you? Close. Go steady. You and Bridget
[2653.32s -> 2664.81s]  make a handsome couple, okay? We gotta live together. No, go on a date. Bridget has an annoying
[2664.81s -> 2669.69s]  habit that grates on your nerves. Here we go. I don't even like this person. I just want to
[2669.69s -> 2674.31s]  get married. Where are we going? When you go out to a restaurant, she licks her fingers at the table
[2674.31s -> 2679.35s]  and sometimes makes loud sucking noises. What do you intend to do about this? Fucking gross.
[2680.31s -> 2692.39s]  Three seconds. Here we go. A little sweep as Orson Welles, maybe a somersault slam,
[2692.39s -> 2698.95s]  whatever the hell that was. And Flanker now has an opportunity. This is an old one. Instantly
[2698.95s -> 2703.99s]  reversed. Dr. Roker is in no shape to be eliminated right now. He's still doing pretty well.
[2704.79s -> 2711.67s]  Ah, you tripped it. I said that and immediately he gets eliminated. Unbelievable. How old is this
[2711.67s -> 2719.98s]  one? The sheer strength of will. 2K17. And he's going to turn the tables. He turns the tables
[2719.98s -> 2723.18s]  immediately after getting almost a new one. And here comes the Snatacat. Snatacat's in the ring
[2723.18s -> 2727.82s]  now. Just praying nobody can see him. He's invisible right now. Nobody knows where he is.
[2727.82s -> 2734.07s]  They can't even tell he's there. And that's how you make a reversal. Oh. Ladies and gentlemen,
[2734.07s -> 2738.55s]  why isn't Flanker gets eliminated from the German Rumble? Not an entire game. Stamp on the bingo
[2738.55s -> 2745.91s]  card. As the Snatacat now makes himself visible to Orson Welles, who is in a little bit of trouble
[2745.91s -> 2752.81s]  here. Orson Welles. Oh, big backwards elbow there. Took him off guard. I thought he was.
[2753.45s -> 2758.87s]  This is the first live rumble, isn't it? Go ahead. Try to reverse Dr. Roker. You're going
[2758.87s -> 2765.64s]  to get this. It has to be. This crowd. They are so behind him right now. And the Snatacat.
[2766.73s -> 2771.93s]  Oh, shit. Here comes another serpent. It's the air serpent. Yeah. When you see an air serpent,
[2771.93s -> 2777.27s]  you know it's at least three or four years old. Guys, I think there's like three boys
[2777.27s -> 2782.23s]  surface left. Orson Welles gets a drop. No, he's still in it. Easiest content ever.
[2782.79s -> 2790.79s]  Was just making seven of these fucking guys. Snatacat drop kick. Chin buster. He was like,
[2790.79s -> 2796.60s]  holy shit, I could just have 10 fucking people be the same person. He's still in it. Kissing
[2796.60s -> 2803.30s]  the elbow. You get to see another elimination here. Could see a easy Pete elimination.
[2803.94s -> 2811.86s]  It's possible. I think who even wins this? You know, you could take that opportunity to
[2811.86s -> 2816.76s]  attack him. Fucking keep doing that. And here comes the tooth goblin.
[2817.80s -> 2825.32s]  Half these characters are sorcery related. He's like just kind of rid of rage. He's seeing red
[2825.32s -> 2830.52s]  right now for the tooth goblin. He hates this fucking spell. He's just destroying right now.
[2831.00s -> 2834.44s]  He came in the ring like a bullet. By the way, just started smashing.
[2836.12s -> 2841.72s]  Derma rumble charity edition should be within the next few weeks. Backstage.
[2842.44s -> 2847.48s]  Sincerely pissing off the air serpent. Look at the top of your screen. Now we have an
[2847.48s -> 2852.44s]  opportunity. That's it. See you later. Easy Pete. That's an elimination. Oh, too bad. Easy Pete.
[2855.40s -> 2859.88s]  Add should be on the bingo card. It is carrying slam there on to the goblin.
[2862.71s -> 2872.47s]  As he goes down, Pete is gone. It's so funny to see in the the serpent edition. I know pretty much.
[2872.47s -> 2881.32s]  Yeah. At this point. Oh, no. That's going to be gone here. Does that does that count as making
[2881.32s -> 2889.21s]  the same joke? Does that count as making the same joke within the last week? No, it doesn't, right?
[2889.21s -> 2901.98s]  That's not a joke. That's me. That's a reference, is it? No. You pick him up. How can you have that
[2901.98s -> 2909.02s]  I don't think that counts. It's a reference. He's looking into doing push ups, whether on top of
[2909.02s -> 2918.30s]  somebody next to somebody. Well, they're in his hands. The goblin, the tooth goblin has an
[2918.30s -> 2922.14s]  opportunity. No, it was an observation. There you go. Yeah, exactly. Dr. Roker's not taking that shit.
[2923.88s -> 2931.18s]  In comes the next contestant. Who wins? No, no, no. James Madison, James Madison with his appearance
[2931.74s -> 2935.10s]  came in around the same time last time. It had to be a president in every one.
[2935.82s -> 2943.11s]  Snap suplex there right under Orson Welles. I can't believe I almost sat there for two hours.
[2943.11s -> 2949.27s]  He was like a ninth president or something. For Dancy Drew. I'm so glad I used Evito.
[2949.27s -> 2957.75s]  Sidewalk slam there onto the two Roker. Air serpent is currently. No, he's all right. He
[2957.75s -> 2962.15s]  just jumped and landed on top and did a bulldog. I think that was scammed a bunch of people.
[2962.15s -> 2971.06s]  I had to do it. I had to do it. Who just who just punched the air serpent? I don't know.
[2971.06s -> 2976.10s]  Air serpents crawling now as if like he's got like no nothing. Nothing on this one guy. Sorry.
[2976.10s -> 2983.50s]  Here he is. Here's the guy. I have no idea who the fuck he is. Here he is. Here's the mystery guy.
[2984.71s -> 2987.83s]  Crash incoming. If it's going to happen, it's going to happen like right now.
[2987.83s -> 2992.71s]  You know what's ridiculous? Drew crew was going to be a slot on here and it would have been
[2992.71s -> 3004.44s]  instantly circled. Because there was like no way it was going to happen.
[3017.90s -> 3019.74s]  Video too quiet. Yeah, I'm trying to adjust it.
[3020.54s -> 3023.66s]  Gone. Mystery man eliminates. He better not fucking win.
[3024.94s -> 3028.70s]  Less than 60 seconds to go to the next one. Tooth goblin. Wow. The air serpent now seems to be
[3029.82s -> 3036.06s]  in a little bit of a problem here. That's not it. No, that's okay. He's getting his chest pushed.
[3036.06s -> 3039.98s]  He's getting his head. He's getting his stomach smelled by Dr. Roker.
[3042.15s -> 3047.11s]  And that's no, it is barely the air. Wait, doesn't it? Doesn't a serpent is he though,
[3047.11s -> 3054.55s]  win this shit? Can you stay in? Did I let that happen like four years ago? Oh man. What the
[3054.55s -> 3059.35s]  fuck was I thinking? Doesn't look like he's going to get it this time. Sorry, Dr. Roker, but
[3059.99s -> 3063.59s]  nice right hand. He's going to get it this time. Possibly again with the chest push.
[3064.63s -> 3070.79s]  He gets stomped in his tracks. Fortunately. And here comes frogman. Oh frogman. From dark souls
[3070.79s -> 3088.86s]  three. And a very good. Here we go. Let's go. The sims for murder house.
[3091.05s -> 3094.41s]  We could get a few here. Oh no, I've heard about this guy. I gotta get out of here.
[3094.41s -> 3100.26s]  We could get a few bingo cards here. Get over here. You tripped it. I'm going to find you.
[3100.26s -> 3105.96s]  There you are. I'm the local resident fucking murderer. Here we go. We could get like three
[3105.96s -> 3113.22s]  or four of these here. We really could. Why'd I stop? This is three hours and 20 minutes into
[3113.22s -> 3121.29s]  what the second stream may be. Her head is just a swivel. And I'll tell her a joke.
[3123.29s -> 3129.45s]  I smell so bad. So many nerds. At this point, was there violence involved in this one?
[3130.01s -> 3140.66s]  Well, that was a log on disabled, disabled reactions, disabled cops. Wait, this might be
[3140.66s -> 3146.78s]  the tail end. Mod info, make partners in crime. It's possible this is the tail end. Exclude the
[3146.78s -> 3153.78s]  sim from getting killed. Enable drain all blood interaction for the sim. Okay. What the hell does
[3153.78s -> 3164.23s]  that mean? Look at all these urns. I gotta get out of here. Did I say it? Did I say I gotta get out
[3164.23s -> 3179.88s]  of here? I gotta go? Did I? No, I didn't. Did I? I did? No, I didn't say it. No, did I? You said,
[3179.96s -> 3186.17s]  I gotta get out of here. Oh, God damn it. Really? Oh, he doesn't care.
[3193.78s -> 3202.70s]  Clear reputation on social media. Somebody's going to walk by and throw me a doll, right?
[3203.26s -> 3213.90s]  Come on. You know, you like this, dude. Don't start laughing. Don't start laughing.
[3220.39s -> 3228.18s]  He fucking ran away. No, he wanted nothing. That is not a laughing fit. That is a chuckle. That is
[3228.18s -> 3233.13s]  a slight chuckle. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I think he was just a little nervous at first.
[3238.52s -> 3246.39s]  No, no, he's gone. Okay. Practice singing. Uh, what about rage? What does rage mean?
[3246.95s -> 3250.71s]  Dude, but we don't have the yesterday's stream. No, not, we don't have that today.
[3250.71s -> 3252.63s]  That's like freaking out and smashing shit.
[3257.40s -> 3265.67s]  Here he comes. Oh, fuck. He's coming over here. Wait, doesn't like death shoot somebody with a
[3265.67s -> 3270.95s]  gun. No, I somebody shoots death with a gun. What's the, what's the drink? All blood.
[3272.07s -> 3278.98s]  When does that happen? I'm going to drink all this lady's blood and see what happens. Deadly
[3279.78s -> 3284.34s]  slice of machete bash head. No, I don't think I've seen any of this yet at this point of the
[3284.34s -> 3293.50s]  stream. Non-deadly. See, I'm like, oh, non-deadly. What's this do? What's that? Where the hell is it?
[3293.50s -> 3304.81s]  Holy shit. I didn't enable it. I thought I did. Everyone else is already dead. Wait,
[3304.81s -> 3308.97s]  hold on. Everybody at this point was, it's already dead. More choices. Uh,
[3310.01s -> 3320.39s]  rain, all blood. Okay. So we're catching like the cool down. We're catching the cool off period.
[3323.82s -> 3328.95s]  You need to be, you need to be a vampire. Oh,
[3330.39s -> 3335.03s]  like asking chat. Hey, so how do I fucking be a vampire? Like I've killed everybody.
[3335.75s -> 3356.26s]  It's time to end this. I'm just gonna try to practice singing. Come on, practice singing.
[3358.30s -> 3363.02s]  It is the tail end. Yeah, you finally get it. This is where I got sick of doing this for so long.
[3363.02s -> 3367.82s]  It was like, oh, I killed everybody. Uh, I like ran people up with cars and I shot like five people.
[3367.82s -> 3381.75s]  Uh, I guess I'm like bored. I guess I'll just stab the character in the stomach now.
[3381.75s -> 3387.45s]  What am I doing? Are we going on an adventure? There's somebody left. What the fuck am I talking
[3387.45s -> 3396.47s]  about by a retail store? I thought I was going to get my head ran over. It's time for gardening.
[3396.47s -> 3405.32s]  Club gatherers can only be held at residents owned by garden gnomes members. I don't think
[3405.32s -> 3410.52s]  I'm sleeping. I'm now, you know how we feel most strange as a cube. This is how you guys feel a lot
[3410.52s -> 3415.02s]  of time. Huh? I'm sitting there going, what the fuck is he doing right now? I'm like, what's what?
[3415.02s -> 3421.22s]  What the I'm sitting here going like, what is he doing? Why is he, why is he doing this right now?
[3421.22s -> 3427.08s]  Now I understand. I get it. I am retroactively annoyed with the way that I am playing the game.
[3427.08s -> 3431.78s]  Fast forward. I'm just like, come on, dude, let's fucking hurry up. It's gonna take a long time.
[3431.78s -> 3438.82s]  He's got five people. That's something done for God's sake. No, no, I get it. What's with the
[3438.82s -> 3446.20s]  Xbox? Oh, that's the alien still bleeding out. No, he's still, see, is it, is it like a I
[3446.20s -> 3453.48s]  misinterpreted something? I can't believe it though. I'm dead. No, the no Nightwing shirt.
[3457.06s -> 3464.20s]  No, not a bad analogy. I tried to get a picture. I couldn't get it. Game over. Or is it the last
[3464.20s -> 3468.12s]  Sim in this household has died, but you can create more Sims choosing the existing household to play.
[3468.92s -> 3482.73s]  No, don't save in managed world. Exit the main menu. You got a game over in the Sims.
[3482.73s -> 3490.63s]  Okay, manage world. Hey, look at this new stuff. So we need a 10 seconds family to move in.
[3490.63s -> 3504.66s]  You ready? I'm ready. I need a household. Uh, where are we going? Cry of fear co-op highlights
[3504.66s -> 3555.16s]  it was. If I replay the video, I might, if I replay the video, I might break the algorithm
[3555.16s -> 3566.25s]  that's running this whole thing. If I, I might break it, I'm going to break the algorithm.
[3571.14s -> 3582.20s]  All right, we're good. Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with scare Saturdays.
[3582.84s -> 3587.64s]  This time on scare Saturday is going to be going through some of the co-op of cry of fear
[3587.72s -> 3596.30s]  with star. Now before anybody asks any questions, this is not going to be a full let's play of cry
[3596.30s -> 3601.58s]  of fear. As much as that would be cool, I would probably rather stream something like that than
[3601.58s -> 3606.94s]  to upload like 50 episodes of this onto my YouTube channel. But it's about a 15 minute video condensed
[3606.94s -> 3610.94s]  kind of highlight reel of some of the scares, some of the funny things that happened, some of
[3610.94s -> 3615.58s]  the happenings we came across. And that's probably what you're going to get. Like I said, I don't
[3615.58s -> 3620.14s]  want to have a huge let's play on this channel. It's like, you know, 50 episodes long. I've gone
[3620.14s -> 3625.02s]  down that path before, as a lot of you guys know, I've done some let's plays and yeah, we're on
[3625.02s -> 3630.70s]  episode six. I'm done. But with that said, here is the video guys, not going to take up any more
[3630.70s -> 3635.34s]  time. I want to get to the content, obviously. So, uh, it's been sunny out, go outside and go
[3635.34s -> 3641.48s]  get some sunbathing because I'm about to do it right now, baby. Sunbathing. Whoa. Take your
[3641.48s -> 3648.52s]  clothes off. I cannot pick up that gun. There's a guy, there's a guy, there's a guy, there's a guy
[3648.52s -> 3653.00s]  over there. There's a guy over here. He's like shifting around like a freak show. Don't shoot
[3653.00s -> 3656.76s]  him. Don't shoot him. What do you mean? Don't shoot him. This is a fricking neighborhood.
[3659.58s -> 3663.66s]  What did you do? Do I have no bullets left? That's not bad aim. I got him in two shots.
[3663.66s -> 3668.86s]  Such recoil on this gun. It's unbelievable. Help me, help me stop shooting this guy. Shoot him please.
[3668.86s -> 3678.70s]  Please. You do it. I have to change my sensitivity. I can't aim like this.
[3678.70s -> 3686.78s]  This video is almost seven years old. I'll cover you. If I die, this is all on you.
[3686.78s -> 3690.62s]  All right, I will cover you. Are you ready now for real? By the way, remember,
[3691.58s -> 3695.98s]  if you were part of the pre-stream chat, hey dude, star, do like a star appearance,
[3695.98s -> 3701.10s]  like an italics appearance. I have a gun too, but this is insanely rare. But number one,
[3701.10s -> 3709.29s]  this is a YouTube video. YouTube fucking video, which is 3.4% chance and a star inclusion,
[3710.49s -> 3721.64s]  which is like an extra like 0.2% chance. I do see it. Is it dead? I don't have any bolts
[3721.64s -> 3726.89s]  left by the way. Yeah, that's kind of happening. We should, I think in our inventory, we have a
[3727.77s -> 3733.21s]  nightstick. I don't know how to equip these into slots. Stars in 30% of your videos. Yeah,
[3733.21s -> 3740.49s]  but we have to hit a video and it has to be a star video. So it's 3.4% chance to have a video
[3740.49s -> 3746.39s]  even play. And then 30%. What's 30% of 3.4%. Something's going to jump up. Wait,
[3746.39s -> 3751.37s]  did I just get bullets? I did. Didn't I? No, I didn't. That was you reloading. I think
[3751.37s -> 3760.62s]  1.2, 1.1, 1.25. This is fucking rare. Get out of here.
[3760.62s -> 3782.73s]  What? Game over. Game over. I was so scared. Good idea. I heard somebody. Did that guy throw a
[3782.73s -> 3791.02s]  brick at you? I think it was blood, but it looks like a brick. I don't think I can take another
[3791.02s -> 3796.12s]  two minutes of this. Where is he? Oh, he's right there. Okay. I have two more videos for the rest
[3796.12s -> 3803.66s]  of the night. Get out of here. Go back to Ikea. Who thought this was scary? Go back to Jordan's
[3803.66s -> 3811.03s]  furniture, you piece of crap. That was kind of fun. The upside down flying mattress, man.
[3811.03s -> 3813.91s]  That was pretty funny. There's more of them. What do you mean there's more? Where are they?
[3817.80s -> 3824.14s]  Oh my God. They're like a flock of crows. It's actually a murder of crows. I remember that
[3824.14s -> 3828.78s]  comment in the YouTube comments. Jeremy, it's a murder of crows, you idiot. You guys haven't
[3828.78s -> 3835.98s]  changed in 10 years. He's still sitting there all mattressy. Something else, something else,
[3835.98s -> 3847.86s]  something else I heard. By the way, 10 years have almost gone by. That guy might be a pain in the
[3847.86s -> 3852.58s]  ass later. Well, we got to go in this way. I think there's a person in this house as well.
[3853.54s -> 3864.18s]  10 years. 10 fucking years. We could be brothers. Oh my God. Oh my God. Is she dead? That was my
[3864.18s -> 3869.98s]  girlfriend, Jerma. What the hell is that? What is that thing from like the island of Dr. Moreau?
[3869.98s -> 3876.06s]  No, that's from XCOM. We made a lot of references back in the day. No, that's the thing from the
[3876.06s -> 3881.98s]  island of Dr. Moreau. Moreau, not Munroe. The thing with, who's the fat actor? I'm scared. I
[3881.98s -> 3888.22s]  can't like think. What do you mean don't know who the fat actor is? You don't know who? What's this
[3888.22s -> 3895.53s]  box over here? That's not a bad analogy. That's pretty good. We're moving.
[3895.93s -> 3899.34s]  Nope, that'd be too easy. We got two of our voices been checked off.
[3901.53s -> 3906.84s]  None of these. This is tearless.
[3908.76s -> 3916.74s]  Guys, I think that's going to be it. Wait. I'm sorry we had so many problems today.
[3918.94s -> 3925.45s]  It was really bad today. What was? It wasn't even bad in the sense of,
[3927.91s -> 3932.07s]  it wasn't even dropping frames. It was just dropping everything. The whole thing would
[3932.07s -> 3940.89s]  just turn off. That sucks. Sorry about that. I think that's like four or five VODs.
[3945.43s -> 3950.47s]  Not much I can do. I knew they were doing maintenance. They were doing something. They
[3950.47s -> 3955.59s]  were upgrading. Oh god, this is going to get close, man. The node or something. This is going to get
[3955.59s -> 3960.79s]  fucking close. Right on time. Give me a break. Maybe they either fucked something up or maybe
[3960.79s -> 3965.99s]  it's one of those scenarios where they're still working on it because the internet here was
[3965.99s -> 3971.75s]  turned off for like eight hours or so. Six hours or so I think. What's wrong with this list? You
[3971.75s -> 3982.60s]  got a problem with this list? Why is GameCube in B tier? Why is the switch so high? Because
[3982.60s -> 3990.36s]  for the longest time, and I'm talking more than 15 to 20 years, I've been searching and hoping
[3991.40s -> 3997.48s]  for an entertainment device that you can use in the bathroom and take a shit when you go
[3997.48s -> 4004.23s]  to the bathroom for 40 minutes. He's so right. I used to bring my computer into the bathroom
[4004.23s -> 4008.71s]  and plug it in and like set up a desk in the bathroom and sit there. He's so right. God,
[4008.71s -> 4016.52s]  imagine being this correct about something. Why is the switch so high? Give me a break.
[4016.52s -> 4024.62s]  It was bad. I used to sit, I used to bring my computer into the bathroom, set it up on like
[4024.62s -> 4032.52s]  a stand-up pop-up table, and then plug everything in and sit on the toilet. Now, shit joke is not
[4032.52s -> 4038.92s]  on here guys. And even after I was done, I didn't, because what a pain in the ass that was to get it
[4038.92s -> 4048.20s]  all in there. So my legs, my legs would start to tingle. I would sit there for an extra like
[4048.20s -> 4054.78s]  25 minutes and I would have to like, I would be getting like tingly legs. This is true. This is
[4054.78s -> 4059.13s]  real. This is not a joke. I was sitting there for too long and that's what maybe had to get up.
[4064.31s -> 4069.14s]  This is, that's not, this is not a lie. This is what, this is actually real life for me when I was
[4069.14s -> 4075.35s]  like 14, 15, 16. I think I remember my mother at the time fighting this and eventually just being like...
[4077.14s -> 4083.22s]  VaudeGerma is funnier than liveGerma. VaudeGerma is Germa. If you're gonna do it, if you're gonna do that,
[4083.22s -> 4088.98s]  this is me talking. This is like four months ago. That's me. That's me talking to you. What do you
[4088.98s -> 4091.78s]  bring, why are you doing all that? Why are you bringing all that stuff into the bathroom? It's
[4091.78s -> 4096.90s]  like, uh, because I wanted, I just, I'm like working. I don't know, I was an idiot.
[4097.80s -> 4102.65s]  No, no, don't, I'm gonna turn off. I'm gonna turn off. Listen to me before I go, before I turn off.
[4102.65s -> 4106.81s]  I want to do the bits, but it's gonna be fucked up. Hold on. All right, long story short,
[4106.81s -> 4112.33s]  I can bring the switch into the bathroom and I can shit on it and keep, and keep my hands close
[4112.33s -> 4118.01s]  and not have to worry about my legs tingling so I can get up whenever I want and put it over. Okay,
[4118.01s -> 4121.61s]  done. This is for real. My internet's gonna turn off. So let's try to get some of these bits done
[4121.61s -> 4136.47s]  before we get shut off. Done. Let's get the, no, not BRB. I will see you guys later. The next time
[4136.47s -> 4140.87s]  you're gonna see me. Stream's not actually over. This is like we're watching something on a certain,
[4140.87s -> 4147.59s]  that's gonna be our stream. So you will see me after this weekend. I'll be back on, what's today?
[4147.59s -> 4160.52s]  What day is it? I will be back on Sunday. Oh my fucking god. So it is, right now it is Thursday.
[4161.24s -> 4168.78s]  I'll be back on Sunday. It flashed. There's a couple of things I want to try to get started.
[4168.78s -> 4173.82s]  I want to try to do a few things on. All right, what are you looking for here? Remember, remember,
[4173.82s -> 4177.74s]  this is. I want to try to set up. This is for 500 community. So I'm gonna work on that. 500. We can
[4177.74s -> 4183.26s]  get it like that. Not 100. A good announcement I can make next week to set that all up. If you don't
[4183.26s -> 4187.42s]  know what I'm talking about. Does it not count? You'll know very soon. It was accidental. I also
[4187.42s -> 4194.62s]  am obviously gonna work on the other stream too. So I will see you guys on Sunday. I'll see it. No,
[4194.62s -> 4199.02s]  this is not, this is fake. But for now, let me see, let me try to get through these bits before the
[4199.02s -> 4203.18s]  internet turns off. And if it does, I'm sorry if I miss your bits or your subs. Remember, not real.
[4203.98s -> 4208.46s]  It's kind of out of my control at this point, but I'm gonna try. It doesn't count. It's not rapid fire
[4208.46s -> 4215.18s]  these. Which usually means I'm gonna do it much slower than normal. All right, press one if it
[4215.18s -> 4225.40s]  counts too. If it doesn't count right now. I hope not. Let me actually hold on. But thank you for
[4225.40s -> 4230.74s]  joining me. It was a lot of fun. That doesn't count. Kind of a long one. I did a lot of twos.
[4230.74s -> 4234.90s]  Playing with Star was a lot of fun. I've seen a lot of twos. Star again? Mentioned. Jesus Christ.
[4235.78s -> 4245.26s]  That doesn't count. That doesn't count. That doesn't count. The majority is spoken. Raid Vinny. Yeah,
[4245.26s -> 4248.70s]  I'll raid Vinny after this. Raid Vinny after this, by the way. That sounds about right. We're gonna
[4248.70s -> 4255.37s]  raid Vinny. All right, so let's go down. 14 seconds. Let's go. Today, I want to see where this
[4255.37s -> 4260.49s]  cuts off because the stream turned on and turned off like five times. Let me make sure this is
[4260.49s -> 4263.69s]  correct. Do you remember back in October, November of last year? It was every fucking day. It was
[4263.69s -> 4273.46s]  horrendous. Here we go. Here we go. That's my vote for Cheez-It. Let's see. Best snack. Cheez-It.
[4275.13s -> 4283.00s]  Another one. Cheez-Nip. Let's see. Well, let the people decide. Wait, I'm doing a vote for
[4283.00s -> 4289.42s]  Cheez-It or Cheez-Nip. Put a filter on your voice so we can determine who's talking. I hope they
[4289.42s -> 4292.86s]  come up with like a Charlie Cheez-Nip. That would make me fucking laugh my ass off. All right, let's
[4292.86s -> 4296.22s]  go. Here comes the poll. All right, I'll put a filter on so you know who's talking. Please vote
[4296.22s -> 4302.06s]  on this poll if you'd like. Okay, okay. The lower one is me. The lower one is me. The one that's
[4302.06s -> 4312.02s]  currently live is me. And introducing first, he doesn't need an introduction. Captain Chi,
[4313.27s -> 4316.95s]  he's currently, he's wearing the best cheese flavored snack belt.
[4317.75s -> 4322.30s]  That is a real belt. He is the champion of all cheese snacks.
[4332.14s -> 4337.98s]  And don't worry. Don't worry. Ladies and gentlemen, it's not like Jerma gave Captain Cheez-It like 99
[4338.06s -> 4344.22s]  in all stats and Captain Cheez-Nip like 30. There's no reverb. He deserves it. Where's the echo?
[4345.74s -> 4352.84s]  Cheez-Nips are fucking gross. And you also be ashamed if you think Cheez-Nips are better than
[4352.84s -> 4361.53s]  Cheez-It. There's no echo. And introducing next, his opponent. His opponent coming into the ring
[4361.53s -> 4368.41s]  right now. A disgusting human being. Trying to kill the American people by the way. Turn off the
[4368.41s -> 4376.94s]  lights. Here they go. Why is there so much reverb? What the fuck is happening? I'm not,
[4376.94s -> 4381.26s]  I don't understand. What's he holding in his hand there? What is that? I know what that is.
[4382.41s -> 4388.49s]  I know what that is. That's the third ingredient in Cheez-Nips. It's poison. I knew it. I probably
[4388.49s -> 4393.61s]  shouldn't have said that. He's poisoning his body. He's getting his ingredients all ready to go.
[4393.61s -> 4396.65s]  I should never have said this. This is like bad. He's fucking poisoning himself.
[4397.29s -> 4406.49s]  Just like all the Cheez-Nips. Disgusting. This is a joke. Charlie Chee at Cheez-Nips. That's not an
[4406.49s -> 4413.78s]  ad. That's me talking about how much this thing sucks. That's not an ad. I don't want to even be
[4413.78s -> 4422.46s]  in the arena right now. Lawsuit incoming. There it is. Okay, let's get that off the screen.
[4424.38s -> 4431.69s]  Hey, by the way, this is like this slander campaign brought to you by. Is it still there?
[4431.69s -> 4435.69s]  Ring that bell. This is an extreme rules. Who has the best cheese flavored snack? Charlie Cheez-Nips.
[4436.33s -> 4440.25s]  Right off the bat with the scoop slam on. This is going to be fucking hard to remember these names.
[4440.25s -> 4446.41s]  This should not be. I'm going to call them Cheez-Nips or Cheez-Nips. This is weird. Hello?
[4446.41s -> 4450.49s]  Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?
[4450.73s -> 4454.41s]  Ooh, a low blow there. Remember, this is an extreme rules match. Hello? Hello?
[4454.41s -> 4458.01s]  Anything goes and then you can go to the outside like Charlie Cheez-It. There we go.
[4458.01s -> 4463.53s]  It's not his name. Just say Cheez-It. Cheez-It. Now you know who's the German.
[4463.53s -> 4469.86s]  Scoops him down. The regular one. My favorite snack is Cheez-It, especially the Tabasco ones.
[4469.86s -> 4474.10s]  They're fucking unbelievably delicious. You should buy as much as you can possibly
[4474.10s -> 4479.38s]  fit in your house. You've got a spare bedroom? Fill it with Cheez-It. How's that? This should
[4479.38s -> 4482.02s]  be bad. You've got a bathroom you don't use very much? I'm a little bit lower. There you go.
[4482.02s -> 4485.54s]  So now you can tell who the real German is. You buy it in the Cheez-It box,
[4485.54s -> 4489.46s]  put it in the Cheez-It box. There you go. This is a real hoist turmoil.
[4489.46s -> 4493.54s]  No, he almost slipped there for a second. Cheez-It's going to be a little greasy.
[4493.54s -> 4498.74s]  They can be a little greasy. Cheez-Nips aren't as greasy. I will agree. Wait a minute. He gets
[4498.74s -> 4503.94s]  caught by Mr. Cheez-Nose and throws him down to the ground. Now he's going to go on the top rope.
[4504.66s -> 4507.94s]  Second rope. We all know if you go on the second rope you're a fucking wuss.
[4508.50s -> 4512.02s]  And that's what he's doing. Exactly what he's doing. You go on the second rope, you're a wuss.
[4512.02s -> 4517.61s]  Wow. Lame. Why does this sound so fucked up? That was fucking lame. It's all right though.
[4518.25s -> 4522.81s]  Totally Cheez-It is going to be able to get up. Okay. Why does this sound so fucked up?
[4524.41s -> 4529.29s]  The yellow guy just did a elbow drop onto the orange guy. Is it better? Orange guy,
[4529.29s -> 4532.09s]  get him. Orange guy got him by the back. Now drops him into the nose.
[4532.09s -> 4535.77s]  No, this is so weird. His big fucking ugly Cheez-It nose. Cheez-Nips nose.
[4536.73s -> 4540.68s]  Nice miss by the way, orange guy. What about that?
[4540.68s -> 4544.04s]  Oh, he gets reversed there. And these are extreme rules. Go get something. Thank you.
[4544.92s -> 4549.40s]  God, I'm talking all this shit and he's going underneath the ring finally for the first time.
[4549.40s -> 4558.52s]  Is that better? No. He picked up a Kendo stick. No, that's a Cheez-Stick. What am I talking about?
[4558.52s -> 4562.84s]  He picked up a giant Cheez-Stick, but he gets reversed. Remember, these are all cheese based
[4562.84s -> 4568.87s]  rules. That is a sharp cheddar cheese stick. Just turn it off. Gets reversed. Now he's going to get
[4568.87s -> 4573.43s]  thrown over it and go for the steps. Well, here we go. We get 25 seconds left before.
[4575.62s -> 4579.54s]  I'm just, I'm trying to differentiate the voices to make it so you can tell who's talking.
[4579.54s -> 4583.54s]  Get him on the table. Get him on the table. What about this? What are you doing? Is this better?
[4583.54s -> 4588.76s]  Everybody stood up. It was perfect. Holy shit. Captain Cheez-It is now on the top
[4588.76s -> 4602.06s]  ropes all the way to the outside. Here comes a no. No. Let's go. He just got a double kill.
[4602.06s -> 4611.24s]  Oblivion. Now this guy's dead. Why are you doing this to me, game? Stop it. Oh, I gotta turn. I,
[4611.24s -> 4618.15s]  I just can't. Something I never fucking finished. Didn't even try. That's a glitch. I told you. I'm
[4618.15s -> 4625.27s]  just julianning fucking french fries. That's a glitch. Okay. Let's put it on there.
[4628.49s -> 4635.70s]  Oh, what are we getting close to? That's not a terrible analogy. That's a good one.
[4635.70s -> 4644.42s]  Julianning french fries. That's fucking smart and funny and interesting and hilarious. Finally.
[4649.14s -> 4655.38s]  All right. Mouth music. No music. No terrible aim. I can't have this happen. Actually hurting
[4655.70s -> 4664.10s]  people. No fall jokes. Hope not. Stop it. Yeah, this is a glitch. This is all fucked up.
[4664.10s -> 4669.16s]  That didn't help. Yeah, no, this is, there's a, it belongs on here. You're right. Hey, stop that.
[4669.96s -> 4682.07s]  Okay, this is wicked fucked up. No, why do we have to, why is there to be at this part?
[4683.08s -> 4692.52s]  No, technical difficulties is something wrong with the stream or a, this is not ignoring the
[4692.52s -> 4698.12s]  game's story. This is me fighting. What? I'm fighting like in a fucking dungeon. At least I
[4698.20s -> 4703.16s]  dungeon. No, I can't. I'll throw up. I'm seriously going to fucking get sick if I do that.
[4703.16s -> 4709.18s]  Is that a technique? I mean, I mean, it kind of, no, it's not. That's me doing that intentional.
[4709.18s -> 4713.86s]  Chainmail greaves. It's a shitty joke. It's not technical difficulties. I wish I could compare.
[4713.86s -> 4721.14s]  I think these are better than what I have. Guard helmet. I think is a little bit better.
[4721.14s -> 4734.23s]  Chainmail greaves. No, they're not iron greaves. Guard helmets. One. I think the other one is one
[4734.23s -> 4743.93s]  as well. I forgot. That's what he looked like for 45. I do. I did a face cam fucking yesterday.
[4751.83s -> 4764.46s]  How close are we? I got to take a look at this. You can't do 720. I think 360 might be the max.
[4765.99s -> 4769.59s]  Don't make any impressions. Yeah. Don't remember. We can go down here too.
[4770.31s -> 4773.19s]  No nightwing shirt. No, I don't think we're going to see the star wars shirt.
[4777.58s -> 4783.50s]  Breaking a game is not on the list. 360 FOV. There it is. Now if you're wondering why
[4785.02s -> 4790.04s]  you're probably curious as to saying, hey, Jerma, why have you not finished Oblivion?
[4790.04s -> 4795.86s]  Why wouldn't you go back to play Oblivion? Because I did all this shit and then the game
[4795.86s -> 4808.41s]  became not interesting anymore. FOV 10. This is just magnifying glass. You ignored the story.
[4809.54s -> 4818.54s]  No, I did, but not right now. Oblivion is like a 450 hour long game. This is not a story.
[4818.62s -> 4828.38s]  This does not mean ignoring the story. This is me like doing one of the quests.
[4828.38s -> 4833.26s]  Why would I? I turned it down. It's a side quest. Nothing else in here.
[4833.90s -> 4839.26s]  Plates, sleeping quarters. I'm so glad I haven't mentioned eating or ass or pissing.
[4839.26s -> 4842.78s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Why? Hey, wait a minute. Nothing up here at all.
[4847.16s -> 4850.92s]  You realize that all your life you've been coasting along as if you were in a dream,
[4850.92s -> 4854.92s]  suddenly facing the trials of last few days, you've come alive. Is that, wait, hold on,
[4854.92s -> 4862.68s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, is that strange noise or is that music? Is that music? No, it's not.
[4862.68s -> 4873.34s]  I mean, it is. It's fucking music. Athletic strength. That's a, no, that's a strange noise.
[4873.34s -> 4888.60s]  How much fatigue you have. That's not me going like. That's like. That's a weird noise. Yeah.
[4888.60s -> 4893.16s]  Don't get mad at that. Basket case. I said level up.
[4893.64s -> 4901.66s]  Well, let's get going. I'm like getting it on my phone. I've just grabbed it as I failed the tutorial.
[4902.86s -> 4913.90s]  He's going. Are they biting people? Why would you run towards the animal? All right. I get it.
[4913.90s -> 4919.70s]  I understand the gist of the game. Is there a rewind? Is there a rewind button? That's not a
[4923.18s -> 4936.12s]  laughing fit. Is this how giraffes sleep? That's fucking crazy. What? Don't you get a stiff neck?
[4940.30s -> 4943.66s]  Okay. All right. I get it. I get it. I understand how this works. That's not a laughing fit.
[4944.38s -> 4952.54s]  That was not a laughing fit. That was not a laughing fit. How do I pick you up? That was not.
[4952.54s -> 4959.08s]  How do I pick you up? That is like where I can't stop. Emergency capture. Oh shit. How do you.
[4959.80s -> 4966.46s]  Too much. Too many bits. This is disabled by the tutorial. No laughing fit is like I can't even like
[4966.46s -> 4973.46s]  talk or breathe. It's all you hear for like 10 straight seconds. So how do I get them back?
[4978.74s -> 4984.73s]  Where are they? There's a lot of potential for. Look I didn't mean to delete this. I'm trying
[4984.73s -> 4989.21s]  to delete plants because it's like. They don't like the shrubs in there. Get rid of them. They
[4989.21s -> 4993.96s]  hate it. What is it the sims? When you have a painting in the room that the sim doesn't like
[4993.96s -> 5004.94s]  they're like fun goes to zero. There's an undo at the bottom. We already have a bad bad impression
[5004.94s -> 5013.91s]  of who? Impression of who? Of what are you talking about? How do I get the animals back in?
[5019.53s -> 5024.41s]  Or I. All right I gotta pee. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. No no where are you going?
[5024.41s -> 5041.78s]  Where are you going? How do I get these animals back in here? He's just walking around. All right
[5041.78s -> 5056.71s]  how do I delete this part? Here come here. Just let them walk around. Let them roam. No I need to
[5056.71s -> 5063.35s]  do the second tutorial. Okay let's do this. Come here. This is this is temporary. I didn't want to
[5063.43s -> 5075.26s]  fuck this whole thing up but I have to. Get rid of this shit. How do I delete this road?
[5077.51s -> 5080.55s]  Call the keeper. I can't. Can I not even. I don't think I can do that.
[5083.08s -> 5089.56s]  Call vet because look I can't. I can't like emergency capture. Is vet gonna go over here?
[5089.56s -> 5102.98s]  What about this? Call the vet. They'll walk back in when I'm hungry. It's going to the bathroom.
[5104.12s -> 5113.75s]  They're all trying to leave. There's a line. There's a line out the door to leave.
[5114.79s -> 5133.27s]  He can't even escape. What the hell was that? What you got? Sniper rifle? What the fuck?
[5135.13s -> 5139.69s]  Just keep keep. Get him. Get him. I didn't want it to go to like to shit.
[5140.57s -> 5142.60s]  Oh no.
[5153.94s -> 5159.30s]  He can just step over this. He can step over this. It's like a baby game. Are you serious?
[5160.18s -> 5167.96s]  All right what'd I miss? What'd I miss? What'd I miss? What did I miss? Just because I deleted
[5167.96s -> 5173.66s]  this that was. Did I miss anything? The vet's on duty. What'd I miss? What habitat's invalid?
[5173.74s -> 5184.70s]  What's wrong with this? Wait where are you going? Laughing fit? Wait is this the part with the
[5184.70s -> 5194.22s]  gorilla? If this is the gorilla part. Did I buy something? Hold on a minute. No no. That's lying.
[5194.22s -> 5216.36s]  Okay okay. All right yeah I see I see. How about a brick wall? All right are we still good?
[5217.08s -> 5224.86s]  Watch the clip. It's funny. Well I I can't. This is an invalid. Well how did it become invalid?
[5225.58s -> 5229.26s]  I can't like watch your clip and watch. I gotta pay attention to the video. How did I fuck this
[5229.26s -> 5247.30s]  up? I don't understand what's wrong with this. You have 158 seconds. Hold on. Where is it? How
[5247.30s -> 5259.75s]  many are in here? All right what I what is wrong with this gate? Marked as not. No no where are
[5259.75s -> 5272.02s]  you going? Where are you going? How did I screw it up? That's pretty funny. Is this part here
[5272.02s -> 5279.98s]  that's a problem? Oh my god Jerma fucking just go do something. The fence was fucked up though.
[5279.98s -> 5285.14s]  How did I fuck up the tutorial? Well it's very easy because I was selecting I was selecting the
[5285.14s -> 5290.42s]  bushes over here and it was selecting this fucking building and I deleted the building when I was
[5290.42s -> 5295.54s]  selecting the bushes here. I did it like 10 times. You sure you don't want to pick up this building
[5295.54s -> 5301.05s]  and delete it? I mean look I'm moving on to the next tutorial. Moulding should have been a free
[5301.05s -> 5306.18s]  space. I know what I'm doing. Seriously. I don't know why it's over here. It should have been a
[5306.18s -> 5310.26s]  free space. I soft-locked myself somebody said. Why were they selecting the bushes? Because they don't
[5310.26s -> 5317.69s]  look. That's not bad. They don't like bushes. They fucking hate them and it was like there's something
[5317.69s -> 5325.88s]  wrong with their habitat. They don't like the bushes. No get 60 seconds. Look see well you know
[5326.12s -> 5330.60s]  they really really don't like those trees. They don't like the bushes either. Oh I think I feel

[5336.01s -> 5345.34s]  or they're gonna hate their environment. Oh that's close. I know how to play. I'm done. We're gonna
[5345.34s -> 5358.18s]  play. That shit was real close. All these plants need to be deleted. He has to mention Joe Rogan for
[5358.18s -> 5368.95s]  it to be an Alex Jones impression. Wait what? That's so true. That is unbelievably accurate.
[5368.95s -> 5377.06s]  Well they hate everything in here. 10 seconds. Okay well in Richmond we need food in here.

[5458.44s -> 5462.68s]  All right it's it's the middle guy. The middle guy is winning by a huge amount. Thank you for
[5462.68s -> 5468.76s]  voting. That's it's a closing poll. Middle guy. By the way why do I have to pick for her?
[5469.48s -> 5476.47s]  She's the one that witnessed the crime. I was just told about it. Why do I have to pick this?
[5476.47s -> 5489.08s]  That's the guy. I'm sure of it. Okay let me scan these people. Okay we need it. We need to go to
[5489.08s -> 5494.46s]  legal level. We got to build the case here. Do identity. Case constructor. I know case for
[5494.46s -> 5513.46s]  identity. There he is. Case for identity. Line up. Okay see. Yep there he is. Why would he just
[5513.46s -> 5520.34s]  scan that by the way? That doesn't seem like something that needs to be scanned. Oh level up.
[5520.34s -> 5525.06s]  I think you spang grew for the 10 bucks. These streams make my night no matter what don't ever
[5525.06s -> 5528.58s]  stop. Wait this is when I was still reading bits during streams. Thank you for the 10 dollars.

[5540.90s -> 5550.49s]  had it made retrieved for a bounty. How old is this stream? 342. Oh thanks a lot man. Thanks
[5550.49s -> 5558.79s]  for the 10 dollars and 26 cents. So 342 three times. Thank you for making me laugh and keeping
[5558.79s -> 5562.87s]  me going while working on game sprites. Well your name makes sense now sprite 37.

[5570.31s -> 5572.71s]  for the five dollars. Have the rest of my tax returns.
[5576.07s -> 5580.55s]  All right let's go. Good old days. All right thank god we're getting the fuck out of here.
[5581.27s -> 5590.28s]  Probably not but you know. There has to be something I can do here but there's just
[5590.28s -> 5593.08s]  absolutely nothing to do. Okay cool. Why does this exist? Of course.
[5594.54s -> 5604.46s]  Like there's nothing here. Let's go back to the courthouse.
[5605.90s -> 5608.70s]  No wait. Well if you really think you're prepared enough go ahead.
[5609.66s -> 5613.91s]  It says four day three. No you guys are looking for a tf2 video. Let's go. Wait I have a new
[5613.91s -> 5618.87s]  I have a new message. An actual rumor issue. Click maps. From what I understand the hearing
[5618.87s -> 5622.79s]  will be conducted in Judge Hilton's office at 10 o'clock on Wednesday morning.
[5624.39s -> 5629.27s]  Yeah yes sir. A court reporter will be present at the time. That was a click. Shoo me away.
[5629.83s -> 5635.99s]  No no no no no. That's the last chance here. That was literally a map click. No no a click map.
[5635.99s -> 5640.55s]  Like the the the circles on the screen. No you can't you know. We're not playing semantics.
[5641.19s -> 5642.15s]  We're not playing semantics.
[5659.45s -> 5661.13s]  The witness tapes. Right the witness tapes.
[5668.09s -> 5672.84s]  Uh that's that's not me talking. That's not an impression. Thanks for the filler.
[5674.87s -> 5678.47s]  Thank you for the filler. I appreciate that. Let's go to the map. Where were those? What happens
[5678.47s -> 5684.87s]  after a bingo? I give 500 community subs. This is what happens. Interrogation records evidence.
[5685.51s -> 5702.06s]  Let's get in here for the trial tomorrow. Basketball, weed eaters. Why are you extending
[5702.06s -> 5714.97s]  this shit? Where's the evidence? Uh we got the car. Scan that. Okay. I gotta stop talking. Just
[5714.97s -> 5719.05s]  got to scan all this shit aren't I? Oh of course I am. And like I'm gonna have to get the fingerprints
[5719.05s -> 5730.38s]  and shit. Oh no. No time for that. Court is about to start. Good luck counselor. Oh no oh god.
[5731.42s -> 5741.83s]  Okay okay. Case for identity. We got this. Okay we got the good old days. Never end.
[5742.71s -> 5749.02s]  And case for murder. We have like killing of a human being. How do you extend
[5749.02s -> 5755.64s]  with channel points? If you highlight a message it is premeditated. 20 000 channel points to add
[5755.64s -> 5771.86s]  30 seconds to a video. Right by the way. And I'm not supposed to be talking. None of this is right.
[5771.86s -> 5775.30s]  You just you know I'm a good talker. You get the guy on that stand and I'll be able to fucking make
[5775.30s -> 5785.50s]  it happen. Here we go. All right. I might have to use. No. I'm gonna use my second needle. The
[5785.50s -> 5790.38s]  honorable Judge Lawrence Adams presided. I'm gonna use my second needle. Uh if you trip it at five
[5790.38s -> 5800.17s]  minutes. I actually just got baited. I did. That was fucking horrible. That guilty motherfucker
[5800.17s -> 5808.60s]  right there. Baiters and gentlemen. Court is now in session. People may proceed with their case.
[5809.40s -> 5814.28s]  It's been five minutes. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Tommy Wu was a pretty worrisome
[5814.28s -> 5820.36s]  with thoughts. All right. Where's the game glitch? Game glitch. Here's Sonic the Hedgehog.
[5820.36s -> 5825.64s]  January 24th. Walking around. You killed it. You killed it. You killed it. By the defendant
[5825.64s -> 5832.25s]  Michael Fong. You will hear in the testimony of Cinderidge Chen how the defendant came into
[5832.25s -> 5838.25s]  Hal's bar with a group of Chu Sing gang members and headed straight for Tommy Wu. You will hear
[5838.25s -> 5845.11s]  how Tommy was choked with a steel cable and dragged to the floor. The defendant is charged.
[5846.71s -> 5850.71s]  In his suit. The evidence will show he is guilty of this charge. Walking back and forth like moving
[5850.71s -> 5858.33s]  his hands around. Oh god. Damn it. I tried to use my second veto and then I... I can't wait to put
[5858.33s -> 5874.30s]  the third disc in. I only get one more after this. Did I miss that? Did I miss the entire
[5874.30s -> 5882.17s]  rat tattoo arc of the whole stream? I had to. There was probably like a whole huge story about
[5882.17s -> 5894.62s]  the rat tattoo. There's an underwater taxi. I thought he was going over the thing.
[5901.37s -> 5904.78s]  I wonder if this is going to get tripped. Of course it is.
[5910.09s -> 5918.07s]  All right. What's possible here? What's actually possible here? Who's in this car? Who the fuck is
[5918.07s -> 5936.98s]  in this car? I mean, molding is done. Screaming is still on the table. Yeah. Ambulance. Impressions
[5936.98s -> 5947.29s]  are still on the table. That's true. Use horn. That was a... That was a rumor here right now.
[5947.29s -> 5955.08s]  Not... That was a rumor here. Not in the past. What the hell is the lion pose? It's this thing.
[5957.08s -> 5962.12s]  I do... I used to do it fucking every stream. This guy's freaking me out. Bad. Big time.
[5964.02s -> 5969.59s]  Okay. Drive to the hospital. No. None of these counts because it's... No, no, no. It has to be...
[5969.59s -> 5981.18s]  No, no, no. Doesn't count. All right. Talk to Dr. Hibbert. All right. Final mission incoming.
[5982.46s -> 5988.82s]  Final? Wait. This is the last mission? Oh yeah. Jerma, you think it's the final mission?
[5989.62s -> 5997.96s]  There's six more fucking hours in this mod. What are you talking about? You think it's the final
[5997.96s -> 6013.45s]  mission? Is that... That was way too fast. Is that a bait? Here we are at our final destination.
[6013.45s -> 6023.30s]  It's just between me and you. Random object. Well, I... Did I say final or did somebody in
[6023.30s -> 6031.38s]  chat say final? That was a selfie. I know my face cam's not on. Why? There's no... Put down the rocks.
[6043.32s -> 6050.44s]  Oh, I was like, what the fuck are you guys doing? Chat said last level. Did they say that?
[6053.96s -> 6058.92s]  We're putting them down by throwing them. Fall joke is very important to not have happen.
[6059.64s -> 6061.72s]  TF2 video's fucking guaranteed to not happen.
[6066.10s -> 6073.30s]  Need a disguise? Purchase. Who's American clothes? Another 425 coins. Click maps is possible. Shit.
[6077.88s -> 6083.56s]  Got this. Is slowing me down. An impression incoming? 57 coins. I mean, that's... It's
[6083.56s -> 6087.32s]  possible. It's possible. I don't know, though. All right, we have to scrounge around now.
[6093.54s -> 6096.50s]  How long am I gonna do this for? We're gonna find boxes. We're gonna find sewing machines
[6096.50s -> 6102.74s]  and box over here. I don't know, until I'm fucking bored. Do a wager race.
[6104.34s -> 6109.64s]  We've seen how much of a disaster those were. I should sleep more.
[6110.52s -> 6120.44s]  Okay, right before he loses. No, no, no. I'll give you time. Okay. So, we'll do this for...
[6121.40s -> 6130.57s]  Uh, not a bad start. At least three or four hours. At least. So, if it's like,
[6130.57s -> 6136.09s]  well, you know, guys, I'm gonna feel like I'm a little sick today. Right before you get a bingo?
[6136.09s -> 6145.88s]  No, no, no. It has to be at least a four-hour spring. At least. Box right here. And a B.
[6146.60s -> 6158.14s]  It took a lot longer than it should have. It's not an impression. What do you get if you win?
[6158.14s -> 6162.86s]  Uh, nothing. I've already been given so much by this community. That's the fucking good answer,
[6162.86s -> 6176.89s]  right? 400, right? Or was it 425? But if I lose, then I'll give Twitch a percentage of the money
[6176.89s -> 6184.17s]  for 500 of you to be subscribed. Nothing, nothing, nothing. That's a nice PR spin. Yeah.
[6184.17s -> 6194.01s]  Yeah. I'll just pay Twitch a bunch of money to sub 500 people. What about the statues?
[6195.54s -> 6201.22s]  The killer sock. Thanks a lot for the sub. KillerSock11518. Thank you for the sub.
[6203.22s -> 6207.54s]  How about one of my cars? Is that person still subbed? How do we check?
[6211.13s -> 6215.05s]  Well, this is too bad because we got rolled a really boring shitty part of this stream.
[6223.29s -> 6226.97s]  This is, this is crazy. So remember, I beat this whole game in one stream.
[6227.93s -> 6231.85s]  This might be the one five to 10 minute portion of this stream
[6231.85s -> 6234.33s]  or I don't sound like I'm going to fucking strangle myself.
[6236.17s -> 6244.65s]  This is weird. This is like a weird downtime for this stream. All right. Do I actually? Very calm.
[6244.65s -> 6262.30s]  I'm very calm and just relaxed. This is a slippery course.
[6270.73s -> 6274.54s]  Did they block off on most of these ways to skip group?
[6278.06s -> 6282.54s]  This is so bad. I think I'm going to have to restart this. Holy shit. I suck.
[6294.44s -> 6303.24s]  Unless I can, I don't think I can do anything. No.
[6304.04s -> 6314.09s]  Maybe I could have like, let's go. The offices. Resident Evil 2 remake. Which one? Up here.
[6314.09s -> 6318.94s]  Oh, by the way, best game that came out last year. Well, what's even hidden up there?
[6318.94s -> 6324.10s]  Cause he talking about that. That's quite, that's a journey for me to go on right now. Hold on.
[6324.74s -> 6334.50s]  If I go up from here, I'm going to get myself fucking killed. We might get a scream. It's
[6334.50s -> 6340.20s]  possible. This is the, this is the one point where it could happen. Thrip it. There it is.
[6340.20s -> 6346.63s]  You might get your scream. So I'm just going to try. I'm going to go up the stairs from here
[6346.63s -> 6359.80s]  and we'll go to the star's office. You got five minutes for a scream to happen here.
[6359.80s -> 6365.98s]  Star's office. You will posing webcams. No, there's already a webcam on the stream. You
[6365.98s -> 6377.45s]  don't need me. If you get screamed, then you're looking for a look at me, a laughing fit,
[6377.45s -> 6386.09s]  or ignoring the game's whole story. Hold on a second. No, I can't go to the showers. There
[6386.09s -> 6398.06s]  are lickers all over the place here. I've got to walk through here and then through the door.
[6398.06s -> 6420.71s]  Now you do. I know there's at least one up here. I've shot this thing 10 times.
[6423.61s -> 6454.52s]  Straight and it's on the left. All right. So where was that? It was somebody's desk with
[6454.52s -> 6462.66s]  coffee on it. Let me take a look. There's a stereo player and then a phone with some
[6462.66s -> 6488.14s]  pens. Let me put the phone with some pens on it. Okay, right here. Wooden box. A slightly heavy
[6488.14s -> 6499.88s]  wooden box. All right. That's all I got. A piece of wood. Come on, I can open this. Red dot sight
[6499.88s -> 6503.40s]  for the lightning hawk. A custom part for the lightning hawk that allows for lightning fast
[6503.48s -> 6518.17s]  aiming. All right. Pretty cool. Oh, so then from that's sick. But the other one is
[6519.29s -> 6532.41s]  with the boom box. I got to get back out to the main hall. And then first floor, it was like down
[6532.41s -> 6547.58s]  here, right? East office or press room. What did I just got more film? Oh, what kind of wild goose
[6547.58s -> 6556.60s]  chase is this putting me on? This is like a treasure hunt. I get the USB to go on the computer.
[6556.60s -> 6567.83s]  I've got to go check the press room. I got to watch out for the liquor. All right. So I got
[6568.71s -> 6585.93s]  back through back into the dark room or maybe not. Yeah. So I got to go back to get to the main hall
[6585.93s -> 6592.76s]  again. It's going to keep searching the desk. What there's like hidden prompts everywhere.
[6592.92s -> 6597.88s]  Why do we get every single part of the screen is so boring? I'm not doing anything. I'm just like,
[6599.40s -> 6604.28s]  how long is this board? We get it's eight hours for me to beat this game. And I can't
[6604.28s -> 6611.64s]  fucking even shoot a guy. I'm going to do the same thing. It's going to go down from here
[6612.57s -> 6616.89s]  and we're going to develop this film. So we just have to slowly make our way away from the liquor
[6617.69s -> 6633.05s]  through the shower. Wrong way. I'm just going, I'm going just back down to the
[6633.77s -> 6640.34s]  hurry. Kiss him. USB USB. I already got the lightning. Forgot that. What do you mean?
[6641.46s -> 6648.42s]  I'm going down. What are you guys talking about? I already did it. Yeah. I know I had, I have it.
[6648.42s -> 6653.14s]  And then I'm going to put that in the secret room downstairs. No, I know. I know what's going on.
[6657.50s -> 6668.01s]  10 seconds for a scream. So then let's just go. No. Fuck it. Run out of time here. It's gone.
[6670.17s -> 6682.79s]  Mafia three. So brutal. Can we get in this car? I pushed his face into the ground from standing.
[6682.79s -> 6702.31s]  Oh no. Witness. Holy shit. Running out of time. Made it to the bar. All right. Let's go. Why? It's
[6702.31s -> 6712.86s]  like GTA. Well, how come it's not working? I thought it was going to like just instantly go
[6712.86s -> 6722.73s]  to the mission. If you don't play mafia, by the way, this is probably here.
[6728.25s -> 6733.37s]  Welcome home, son. Early. Yeah, it's an early stream. I'll be better once I get some of that
[6733.37s -> 6745.67s]  shine in me. Let's make a toast. I just drove over like four people.
[6747.35s -> 6757.11s]  He was joining the military. That's not confirmed yet. That's not confirmed yet. It's
[6757.11s -> 6761.75s]  gone out. Oatwells. Oatwheels. Thanks for two months, dude. Go out and make his mom.
[6762.63s -> 6774.55s]  And that's precisely what he did. I'm so, so proud of you. Oh, cut scene. Ain't seen one of
[6774.55s -> 6785.80s]  those in a while. Oh, that's such an ignoring cut scene. That's so my god. Oh, cut scene.
[6785.80s -> 6791.88s]  The cut scene started like three minutes ago. Wow. Holy shit, dude. That was unbelievable. The
[6791.88s -> 6797.24s]  cut scene started like two minutes ago. I really appreciate that. God damn it. Whatever.
[6801.77s -> 6810.01s]  It's hard to explain what it's like coming home. That was so bad. I didn't even know the cut scene
[6810.01s -> 6814.97s]  started. Holy shit. What's the consensus of this game? What's like the reviews on it?
[6816.09s -> 6824.39s]  Like six. You didn't know that before you started streaming it? Why? You knew it wasn't in the
[6824.39s -> 6830.62s]  schedule. You knew it was a six before you started streaming it. You were just concerned
[6830.62s -> 6836.86s]  that other people might not have liked it. It sucks. That doesn't really. That doesn't really.
[6836.86s -> 6845.61s]  Yeah, you knew that. Bad, bad, very bad, really. Story is good for the gameplays, man.
[6848.76s -> 6857.35s]  It feels pretty fun so far. Feels pretty, feels, you hear that? Do you hear that?
[6858.15s -> 6864.71s]  Feels, feels pretty fun. Why? I gotta work on that. I gotta work on that. I gotta work on that.
[6866.25s -> 6872.57s]  Feels pretty good. Is this any good? Is this any good? Is this any? I gotta work on that. Bad port.
[6872.57s -> 6887.37s]  Liar voice. I gotta work on that. I'm glad we're doing this. Bad aim could happen here.
[6889.06s -> 6907.14s]  I need like a meditation video. I need to do a meditation. Guided meditation. Hold on.
[6907.14s -> 6914.55s]  Tripped it. What do we got here? Guided meditation? I have to do this, guys. I'm sorry.
[6914.55s -> 6927.34s]  I'm like, I'm all fired up. Damn it, not a Star Wars shirt. I thought it was a Star Wars shirt.
[6927.90s -> 6936.65s]  It was possible. What the fuck even, what happens here? It's supposed to be instructions. What
[6936.65s -> 6943.43s]  happens here? Thank you for being here, dear soul. I'm Kenneth, and from my heart I will...
[6943.43s -> 6948.47s]  Is this the cheers for you, guy? This is the cheers to you, guy? I think this is the cheers to you.
[6948.47s -> 6951.96s]  ...make yourself as comfortable as you can right this moment.
[6951.96s -> 6956.92s]  You think it's sweaty? No, I'm not. We gotta get an armpit shot. We gotta get a shot of the
[6956.92s -> 6963.78s]  underarm. If there's sweat under the underarm, sure. Observing the words I share with you like
[6963.78s -> 6971.06s]  a soft breeze on a summer night. Noticing that whatever it is that you notice,
[6971.70s -> 6980.31s]  your body may begin to relax more and more as you listen to my voice and go deeper within.
[6980.31s -> 6984.55s]  How would somebody be able to sleep to this? Could you imagine... All right, seriously,
[6984.55s -> 6992.07s]  wait a second. Wait. Can you imagine if you were trying to go to sleep, okay? You lay down and
[6992.07s -> 6995.19s]  you're like, man, I really wish I had something to help me go to sleep. And I'm like, I only help
[6995.19s -> 7001.78s]  you there. And I go right up to your fucking ear. And I'm like, very soon you'll be sleeping.
[7002.94s -> 7008.94s]  And just to let you know, it's so relaxing in this room. And very soon you'll be going to bed,
[7009.90s -> 7014.46s]  just like the breeze of a sunny summer Monday morning. That's not an impression. That's the way
[7014.46s -> 7018.94s]  that you'll see the world. You're gonna be like, what are you doing to me? Like, I'm trying to
[7018.94s -> 7024.70s]  sleep. I need complete silence and I need nobody talking and I don't want any lights on. That's
[7024.70s -> 7029.70s]  not an impression. All right, let's see if we can... Now I'm even more fucking on edge than I was
[7029.70s -> 7034.26s]  before. It didn't help at all. No, that's not an impression. It's not an impression of that guy.
[7034.26s -> 7044.39s]  That's me doing, me doing that video. No, it's not an impression. Not an impression. No, it's not.
[7044.39s -> 7053.54s]  Where is my meditation? I just had it. Where is it? It's on a different window. What the fuck
[7053.54s -> 7056.26s]  is this window? Why is it down here? It was an impression of that fucking guy. Of course it was.
[7057.24s -> 7064.52s]  Help me. Come on. No TF2 video and we're good. And I want no Nightwing shirt, no TF2 videos.
[7078.58s -> 7082.82s]  Color in the molding box. Yeah, okay. We might as well just fucking color this in.
[7084.57s -> 7090.15s]  This is the free space. You know, just fucking write it on there.
[7090.15s -> 7105.48s]  Turn this shit off. Stubborn. Just seriously write it down. Let me fucking relax.
[7106.68s -> 7111.18s]  Because I drank a Coke that's an ad. That guy just made me so fucking angry.
[7118.62s -> 7133.45s]  I drank a Coke on camera and it's an ad. What? I can't drink a Coke on camera? All right,
[7133.45s -> 7136.49s]  I need to actually go over this. Tristan found him like this. He must have been taken here.
[7137.30s -> 7141.46s]  Found cut marks around his wrists and ankles. Death by strangulation. TF2 video.
[7142.82s -> 7148.66s]  Fall joke is bad. A real rumor moment is bad too. Yeah, seems like a killer may have robbed him
[7148.66s -> 7156.47s]  on like previous victories. Uh, not victories. Couldn't find the kids. How's this going on?
[7159.11s -> 7164.31s]  Who knows? Might have been someone else. Oh, I forgot about this. I did this shit, right? I
[7164.31s -> 7172.23s]  recorded myself for five minutes before stream. I'm on. I'm off. Right. I forgot about that.
[7172.23s -> 7175.91s]  I did a full like five to ten minutes of recorded base cam before the stream turned on.
[7175.91s -> 7179.03s]  I'm gonna head back to the office. And it was voted one of the worst jokes of the year, right?
[7179.03s -> 7183.75s]  Two years ago? This is ruining the game for me. I'm too angry. I'm just too hard. Oh,
[7183.75s -> 7188.87s]  it's gonna get so much worse. I'll let you know if we find anything else. All right.
[7189.59s -> 7192.39s]  Yeah, that was like worst joke that took. Yeah, I remember that. That was two years ago.
[7193.03s -> 7197.59s]  Why does that guy have that move? Why does that guy die? Why does that guy die in one hit?
[7199.59s -> 7202.55s]  Jerma mocking him getting mad at a video game should have been on here.
[7203.19s -> 7211.03s]  The same people who make this game. Like Jeremy getting angry at a game is one thing,
[7211.03s -> 7214.87s]  but then he mocks how mad he was and how embarrassed he is that he got that angry in
[7214.87s -> 7222.36s]  the first place. That could have been a square. Bad aim incoming. We have 50 seconds to see it.
[7223.08s -> 7227.51s]  Hey guys, just got the masks we ordered. Pretty cool, eh?
[7231.54s -> 7238.18s]  They're all chickens. Well, how do they feel? You like them? No gameplay at all yet, guys. Zero.
[7239.62s -> 7240.50s]  Zero gameplay.
[7240.50s -> 7295.32s]  I'll get it. What's next? L.A. Noire part three. I gave up on this game by the way.
[7304.44s -> 7308.76s]  I got like three or four streams into this and then somebody told me, dude,
[7308.76s -> 7322.57s]  you got like another 30 or 40 hours. And I was like, oh, okay. That's fun. Matches.
[7322.57s -> 7330.57s]  Matches are never anything. Ever. It's never matches. That's a one guy moment? How?
[7331.13s -> 7335.21s]  What do you mean that was a one guy moment? What are you talking about? How?
[7335.21s -> 7346.01s]  I still feel these seeds in my mouth. I'm going to have to go throw up.
[7346.41s -> 7355.18s]  No. One guy moment. It happened. You said it did. It didn't happen in the video. No.
[7356.34s -> 7371.27s]  Not at this part. No. It's there in my teeth. It's bad. I can't wait until we get the 1%
[7371.27s -> 7375.75s]  chance for Otto's Great Adventure 2 and I've used my third veto over the night to get rid of it.
[7378.36s -> 7387.42s]  Somebody did the scene plus the blood stains. No way is this coincidence.
[7388.06s -> 7396.47s]  Okay. Shoo on head. I better put this on my head or chat will think it's pre-recorded.
[7396.47s -> 7399.43s]  That was good. That was good. Where's like the good fucking joke square?
[7400.07s -> 7415.18s]  Where's the good joke square? Cause that was a good one. We kept the area pristine for you boys.
[7415.18s -> 7421.58s]  That's too rare to have it be a square. Boston accent was going to be one too. In
[7421.58s -> 7423.82s]  pre-stream we were trying to talk about what should be here.
[7423.82s -> 7434.33s]  Boston accent was a square and I got rid of it last second. God damn it.
[7440.15s -> 7450.34s]  15 seconds. Five house keys strung up like bait. There is 3,200 hours of footage.
[7451.48s -> 7461.91s]  Where will we? Oh, nevermind. I said five seconds. I said five seconds remain. Like what?
[7461.91s -> 7465.99s]  I can't say that you get the timer on the screen. I'm reacting to the same timer that you have on
[7465.99s -> 7480.58s]  your screen. I'm safer. Two by three. Rise up. That was such a waste for an extension.
[7481.46s -> 7493.22s]  This is nothing happening. What are you doing? What's 253? What is 253? Why are you guys saying
[7493.22s -> 7506.65s]  250? I'm not going to veto this. What a waste. What is on the roof? Oh, is the note. All right.
[7507.37s -> 7523.62s]  That was record time. That was record roof time. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't fall
[7523.62s -> 7532.87s]  off the edge. Do not walk off this edge. Do not. Don't. It's not worth it, Jeremy. Don't do it.
[7532.87s -> 7540.79s]  Three years ago, Jeremy. Don't walk off the edge. I know you probably think it's going to be very,
[7540.79s -> 7552.38s]  very funny, but it's not going to be funny. Don't do it. Don't fall off the fucking edge. Don't do
[7552.38s -> 7579.10s]  it. It's funny. I'm laughing at that one. I don't care if it's me. It was fucking four years ago.
[7579.10s -> 7584.78s]  I don't remember saying that. That was funny. That was funny. I liked that one. If it would
[7584.78s -> 7588.38s]  any other streamer doing that, I would have laughed at it. That was a funny joke. Guy from four years
[7588.38s -> 7604.15s]  ago. What? That game's not good. Who has this much blood? You would have died two pipes ago.
[7604.71s -> 7617.96s]  Okay. Oh, look. Another wedding ring. I'm the wedding ring killer. I kill people and then take
[7617.96s -> 7630.39s]  off the wedding ring. Here comes the fall joke. Find me if you can. I'm probably going to do it,
[7630.39s -> 7641.96s]  and that's the worst part about this. Looks as though the killer was decorating with this.
[7645.00s -> 7658.26s]  He's just a sick fuck. Okay. Here it comes. Here it comes. Red bag. Don't do it. The other half.
[7659.24s -> 7665.40s]  I'm not this much of a dickhead. Each once are identified. Mrs. Antonia Maldonado,
[7666.04s -> 7670.76s]  712 North Hill Street downtown. No, I'm not this much of a dickhead. I wouldn't just walk off the
[7670.76s -> 7681.37s]  edge. Okay, well, we have an address. That's the end of the trail. Oh, we almost did. Yeah,
[7681.37s -> 7692.47s]  it kind of has to be. Too bad to all those people that wasted their points. Whoa. I was
[7692.47s -> 7704.38s]  thinking there was going to be a fall joke. Sorry, guys. God, that was an explosion. It was Mrs.
[7704.38s -> 7709.42s]  Maldonado, right? That's affirmative. Right, so then there's a husband we should be looking for.
[7709.42s -> 7715.50s]  Get him. We've closed the case. Rusty's razor, of course. I don't want to question your tried
[7715.50s -> 7718.94s]  and tested technique. I'm going to T again. I'm going to be pissing out C. But doesn't the D.A.
[7718.94s -> 7724.86s]  require sound casework before he'll close the book? No, he's got to confess. And you know,
[7724.86s -> 7736.36s]  there's ways of getting. I'm sure. Testings and a stomach and everything that could process all
[7736.36s -> 7760.78s]  this shit. Wait, why is this one black? Oh, no. It was actually to your benefit. Oh. Have a stomach.
[7760.78s -> 7765.34s]  No, no, no, not a stomach, but just the way that it separates it. You guys don't realize your body
[7765.34s -> 7770.14s]  is a gigantic coin separation machine. You know when those old machines you put in the dime,
[7770.14s -> 7774.94s]  the nickel, the quarter, and it would go, put it in the right slot. If your body didn't have one
[7774.94s -> 7780.78s]  of those down there, we'd be in a lot of trouble. That's true. No, I get it. I know what he's saying.
[7780.78s -> 7784.22s]  But the weird thing, though, is even those machines, sometimes you put like a penny in
[7784.22s -> 7788.14s]  and it would fuck up and go in the quarter slot. So why are our bodies so good at?
[7789.82s -> 7795.35s]  How come a nickel doesn't go into the dime slot sometimes? If you catch my drift.
[7804.78s -> 7815.24s]  Sometimes I read the one comment that makes me laugh. Are you this stupid on purpose?
[7815.24s -> 7836.79s]  I'm here. Which one's Kenny? Tables are turned now, haven't they, boys?
[7838.07s -> 7841.27s]  Hey, look, old man. We're sorry. Well, Kenny's not here.
[7848.54s -> 7864.30s]  Kenny's not in this scene. Blatant one guy moment. I know. That wasn't bad aim.
[7870.49s -> 7875.86s]  No, that wasn't bad aim. That was fine.
[7885.64s -> 7888.60s]  That was not bad aim. That was I shot once and the guy was running.
[7889.64s -> 7898.52s]  Blatant bad aim has to be very, very much confirmed. It's got to be like, holy shit,
[7898.52s -> 7904.01s]  that was horrendous. I want to subdued the last one. I want to scream either.
[7904.73s -> 7918.92s]  Got to reload. He's got to reload. How do I tackle him? No scream is like, oh,
[7918.92s -> 7923.64s]  it's got to be fucking a scream. It can't be like, oh, or oh, I tried to hit X,
[7923.64s -> 7932.49s]  accidentally tackle. It's going to be like, oh, we're like, oh, it's time to eat lots of bacon.
[7932.49s -> 7937.93s]  This is car 11 K shots fired at South Flower Street, Scott's garage. It's cold for here,
[7937.93s -> 7956.39s]  but just like it's down, I need an ambulance and corner. So the guy did die. 95. We've already had
[7956.39s -> 7964.90s]  too much bacon. What do we got? I'm surprised. No shirts, no night wing shirt, no star wars shirt,
[7964.90s -> 7973.77s]  no clip maps. I did that all the time. You guys eat eggs in one bite for us. One bite.
[7974.49s -> 7979.30s]  You go to a breakfast place and you order to sunny set up eggs or two or whatever.
[7980.26s -> 7991.03s]  Shit, I'm not even looking up and sorry, the whole thing. I wasn't even looking.
[7992.79s -> 7997.35s]  Watching this shit from an audience perspective, you don't get all of the other stuff like
[7998.39s -> 8003.67s]  sometimes I'm just I'm gone. When I'm talking like this, I'm gone.
[8004.55s -> 8007.72s]  I'm not even, the game is not even here. It's like,
[8008.44s -> 8016.38s]  I'm just talking and there's nothing here and I just drive into shit. I don't understand.
[8018.68s -> 8024.74s]  But yeah, that's disgusting. Where we going? Then you think like 30% of the audience here.
[8025.54s -> 8036.30s]  Let me restart it. Turma streams, chat, playing games. We got cul-de-sac smash,
[8037.35s -> 8042.79s]  Ed Eddeney's candy machine, lunchroom rumble, or spin stadium. By the way, the title says
[8042.79s -> 8061.85s]  Nickelodeon. Click map there though. Okay, we've got cul-de-sac smash. And there is a fucking
[8061.85s -> 8071.90s]  vroomer there too. Got pretty good radio, 44 million plays. Two in a row. You got to kidding
[8071.90s -> 8089.69s]  me. It looks like this is going to be the one. Uh oh. No TF2 video. See how it is? I don't even
[8089.69s -> 8103.26s]  remember this stream. Here we go. Cul-de-sac smash. Okay. Instructions. Accelerate. Let's turn
[8103.26s -> 8113.11s]  the ads already filled in. I can't do this. This music is going to make me fucking scream.
[8115.90s -> 8121.90s]  This is nightmare music. I can't even talk. I have to take my headphones off.
[8123.02s -> 8127.10s]  When each derby to advance to the next location, earn cash by competing in derbies
[8127.10s -> 8129.50s]  and make repairs and build new go-karts in the shop.
[8132.09s -> 8135.61s]  In a collision, the faster go-kart does more damage. Keep an eye on your damage meter.
[8136.57s -> 8147.24s]  Okay, peace driver. Does that just mean fast music? That's like cartoon fast?
[8148.36s -> 8152.36s]  What does that mean? That's fast cartoon music.
[8154.84s -> 8174.47s]  Okay, looks like we're going to be Ed. Here comes an impression. I'm going to go.
[8178.15s -> 8184.23s]  I'm going to do it. Is it filled in? This is already filled in. Get a dollar for first prize.
[8184.23s -> 8187.59s]  I'm going to do it. Okay, I'm ready. Zippy, pick a go-kart.
[8187.59s -> 8190.71s]  If I have an excuse to do an Ed voice, like an Eddie voice.
[8192.07s -> 8196.71s]  Oh, I'll do it. I'll do it every time. There's probably three impressions in
[8196.71s -> 8204.57s]  this part of the screen. This is so loud. Click maps. Are you stupid?
[8206.33s -> 8222.73s]  Oh shit. This is on screen. Get off the screen. How are you supposed to play this?
[8225.91s -> 8229.85s]  I don't understand what's happening. Is it just bumper cars?
[8229.85s -> 8249.02s]  Could have done a loud game. Yeah. I guess golf is out. Why is Eddie just Bernie Sanders?
[8251.85s -> 8259.35s]  Okay, so what we're going to do is we are going to just, unfortunately, the one percent
[8260.15s -> 8268.28s]  has all of the money. We've got to take it away. Kind of. Not really, though. That was fun.
[8268.28s -> 8279.66s]  All right. Okay. That was Ed, Edd, and Eddie. Thanks for playing Ed, Edd, and Eddie. I hated
[8279.66s -> 8286.92s]  that. You can tell. You can tell that I was like, holy shit, get me the fuck out of this.
[8286.92s -> 8303.46s]  Please let me do anything else. I got to pee. Can I piss? I was like rage drinking water.
[8303.46s -> 8308.74s]  I'm going to pee. I'll be right back. You got to keep like clicking on the screen. No, no, no, no,
[8315.58s -> 8331.94s]  oh, no. Oh, the only thing that this, if I do this, if I do this on camera, 500 community subs.
[8332.58s -> 8350.68s]  Oh, this is a, this could happen if you thought there was no chance that this was going to happen.
[8350.68s -> 8360.54s]  I got news for you. I used to do that once every other day. Where are we going? Oh, no, no, no,
[8360.54s -> 8372.81s]  not a face cam. This is possible. Oh, I'm going to do it. Well, I mean, you got to see once or
[8372.81s -> 8376.97s]  twice before you know when the things are happening. Your skill was a business trip. You'd miss a
[8376.97s -> 8400.52s]  meeting down the hall. They left airline. That's pretty good. God damn it. You got to be kidding
[8400.52s -> 8410.22s]  me. 30 goddamn five in 2020. This is looking pretty good for three five. Excuse me. I've got
[8410.22s -> 8418.06s]  some donk donks to take care of the shirt. No, that is not a star wars shirt. It's not a star
[8418.06s -> 8436.42s]  wars shirt or a night wind shirt. This is before I got very, very upset. I said an email. What
[8436.42s -> 8448.44s]  email did I say? What was the email? What email? Wait, what did I say? You said Pepe laugh. Oh,
[8448.52s -> 8471.54s]  shit. Where is it? Where is it? Oh, we got like three right now. Oh, shit. No, look at me is no
[8471.54s -> 8491.58s]  baited. Don't do it. I'm too distracted to do the lion pose. It's not going to happen. That's not
[8491.58s -> 8515.54s]  mouth music. Me going. That's not mouth music. Mouth music is like me humming a beat or me beat
[8515.54s -> 8536.09s]  boxing or me like singing, not going like you get a purpose on remix four right now. You look like
[8536.73s -> 8544.34s]  you can't throw that. I'm trying to do remix six. Oh, don't do it. I can feel myself looking into
[8544.34s -> 8555.26s]  the camera mule doing that post Billy. If I win by a large amount on one of these, I'm going to do
[8555.26s -> 8582.62s]  it. No screen either. It's kind of crazy.
[8606.15s -> 8631.86s]  You fucking idiot. You stupid asshole. God damn it. Just hit every shot from now on. Please.
[8632.74s -> 8656.79s]  That wasn't a scream. That was a yawn. That was a loud yawn. That was not a scream.
[8656.79s -> 8668.30s]  Now, scream has to be very, very clear. Do not do any bad aim. Nailed it. No TF2 videos.
[8669.10s -> 8676.22s]  I don't have any rhythm. Something that I think a lot of people are misunderstanding when I do the
[8676.22s -> 8681.74s]  remixes. It's you can't it's hard to have rhythm when you have to play seven different songs
[8682.54s -> 8689.14s]  that intercut into each other. That's like if you have a guitarist that's on stage and he's
[8689.14s -> 8696.84s]  please. Stop. If I fall, I just need to, you know what I mean? You panic
[8699.80s -> 8704.36s]  because you know you're going to be skidding. Here comes the scream.
[8705.48s -> 8712.07s]  And this is late game too. I was fucking. What happened there? I did a full jump. That's worked
[8712.07s -> 8719.50s]  every single time. I did a full jump. What the fuck happened? I did a full jump. That's happened.
[8719.50s -> 8727.54s]  That's worked every time. Come on, man. What? That's not a fall joke. Fall joke is
[8727.54s -> 8731.30s]  somewhere where you're not supposed to fall ever aggravating. You walked up here.
[8732.26s -> 8736.25s]  I'm waiting for a sorry. I forgot. I'm playing aggravation simulator.
[8736.25s -> 8752.10s]  Oh, just rename it. Just do it. What? What? Oh, I call this jumping like just rename this game.
[8752.82s -> 8756.74s]  I'm trying to piss you off. That's it. Just that's what it's that's what it should be.
[8756.74s -> 8763.48s]  That's what it should be called. This is not about jumping. It's about trying to make as many
[8763.48s -> 8776.04s]  and many people angry as possible. Terrible aim. I think this shit was in an episode of Dexter's
[8776.04s -> 8780.44s]  lab one time. There was like an evil guy that like didn't want to make everybody like sad or
[8780.44s -> 8787.50s]  like angry and gave them like a video game to play and it like worked. Oh no, sorry. That's the
[8787.50s -> 8794.17s]  that's jump king. Right. What the fuck is he talking about? I think that's the same thing.
[8799.08s -> 8802.52s]  If you miss a jump. No, you missed. That's the whole point of the game is to miss jumps.
[8804.39s -> 8820.17s]  That was the powerpuff girl was from. That's from Phineas and Ferb. Is that show still on there?
[8821.05s -> 8829.66s]  Are they still making new Phineas and Ferb cartoons? No, talking about Vegas either,
[8829.66s -> 8836.57s]  which is weird. I'm going to get up to the top. How far away is the bud? Thank God. About halfway.
[8839.06s -> 8843.22s]  Why? What's wrong? Why? What's wrong? I'm going to get up there and scream. What's wrong with
[8843.22s -> 8855.50s]  Phineas and Ferb? Did it end it? Did it really? Once I get to the end game here. What's wrong with it?
[8855.50s -> 8859.26s]  Phineas and Ferb was only good new age. The only good new age cartoon show.
[8860.14s -> 8871.35s]  It was years ago. I didn't say I was somebody in chat said that. I didn't say that. What are
[8871.35s -> 8877.03s]  some of the cartoons that were like worth watching? I don't remember. That's not me
[8877.03s -> 8883.38s]  talking. That's me responding to chat. Come on. That's not me saying that. That's not me saying
[8883.38s -> 8905.99s]  that. Nope. Holy shit. That's a that's an odd one. How do you get that jump? Holy fuck. How do you
[8905.99s -> 8918.92s]  supposed to get that? We're good. Didn't say shit. Wait, that's the first time I've seen this. Oh,
[8918.92s -> 8941.29s]  boy. Don't move. Don't move. I sound pretty calm. I saw them collected. What am I? Am I
[8941.29s -> 8963.11s]  defeated at this point or what? Fall all the way. Still haven't nailed that down yet.
[8963.67s -> 8974.06s]  Fall all the way down to the candles and I'll probably scream. Here comes. I'm not saved.
[8977.86s -> 8987.54s]  Wow. That set the jump to the the jump to the it's just so hard to judge it.
[8988.18s -> 8991.30s]  Even when you do a little one it doesn't seem like it's enough. Wow.
[8999.72s -> 9006.89s]  That's remarkable. It's already filled in. Don't even say it. It's been filled in.
[9008.18s -> 9015.24s]  Get out there. It's only a minute left before this is done. I'll be back in an hour. Hey,
[9015.24s -> 9024.30s]  I'm gonna go get some boots. What size are you? 16. I've got these big ass goofy feet.
[9035.66s -> 9038.62s]  No, I'm I'm still perfectly fine at this point in the butt.
[9042.14s -> 9045.66s]  It's this this one. You got one more chance up here when I get up here. Didn't make that.
[9046.55s -> 9058.79s]  Why did I not make that? Wait, how did I not make it over that? Is the same person? I don't
[9058.79s -> 9069.51s]  understand. What? I'm shocked. Why am I so calm? Because it's wasted breath to be angry at a game
[9070.23s -> 9077.24s]  who was what was it was designed to make you hate everything about your current life. What
[9077.24s -> 9081.16s]  you're doing right now. I'm not going to let it win. I'm not going to give it the saddest.
[9081.96s -> 9089.56s]  I'm sorry to say. TV Robo. Well, plan on it.
[9092.73s -> 9097.53s]  This is the last week. I don't know. Look, I got all this to do first. I got
[9097.53s -> 9100.97s]  we got Mario Sunshine to do first. That's priority number one. Did that. That was fun.
[9103.13s -> 9106.09s]  I was slowly going up the rankings now. It's pretty early in TV Robo.
[9114.81s -> 9120.25s]  Same joke as last week. I also played those old Zelda games when they first came out.
[9121.21s -> 9135.90s]  I did Ocarina of Time. I don't think I have a lion mask. Where are we going? Cry of fear
[9135.90s -> 9147.48s]  co-op highlights. It was okay. I'm going to say something. Wait, where are we talking about?
[9147.48s -> 9159.67s]  Where are we going? I'm going to say some lion pose here. No, this is a real, real opinion.
[9159.67s -> 9165.37s]  Thumbnail. What do you mean the thumbnail? What? I think I've said this before on stream.
[9168.46s -> 9174.10s]  Zelda games, although I respect everything they've done for the industry,
[9174.74s -> 9182.90s]  I respect it as a series. I understand why people love it. They don't do it for me.
[9182.90s -> 9193.40s]  Zelda games don't do it for me. That's it. That doesn't count. That does not count.
[9194.76s -> 9200.92s]  It doesn't count. That's not the video I was watching. That's a separate video.
[9201.48s -> 9206.30s]  Oh, my fucking stomach.
[9216.38s -> 9236.07s]  Oh, my stomach. That was really good. That was really good. Lion pose possible. Lion pose.
[9236.07s -> 9243.29s]  I don't want to get any spoilers. I keep fucking going to this. I don't want any spoilers.
[9247.88s -> 9256.90s]  All right. Let's take a quick pee break. Thank God. See you guys in like two minutes.
[9256.90s -> 9262.36s]  Oh, thank God. We're at pretty much the halfway point. Please, please take a piss.
[9262.36s -> 9265.64s]  More to see. Step in straight minutes. Oh, I got to get some water.
[9265.64s -> 9269.40s]  Take a step in straight piss. Oh, wow. Thank God for that fucking RNG.
[9269.40s -> 9281.14s]  Saved by the RNG God. RNG God. This is empty. I can't fucking believe it's in that thumbnail,
[9282.87s -> 9308.15s]  but it has to be in the video. It's so fucking funny. That is actually fucking funny.
[9309.03s -> 9315.93s]  That I mean, it does, but it doesn't count because it has to be in the stream or in the video that
[9315.93s -> 9326.23s]  we're currently the time that we have. It can't be for a different video, but that should give you
[9326.23s -> 9333.62s]  confidence that within the next hour that it's going to show up somewhere, because if that was
[9333.62s -> 9353.82s]  in a thumbnail, that means I do that shit all the fucking time. You have an opportunity with
[9353.82s -> 9363.98s]  the lion pose. Terrible aim. The this one's the most likely to happen before this for sure.
[9366.02s -> 9370.09s]  I'm so glad we hit this right here because this is green screen movie night. This is
[9375.26s -> 9377.90s]  I'm so this is that there's so many of these could happen in here.
[9382.97s -> 9395.14s]  Technical difficulty. Why go to the bathroom? Laughing fit could happen here too. And then
[9395.14s -> 9407.30s]  we just need a Star Wars shirt. Bad aim to the toilet. No, I see. I see what you're doing.
[9407.30s -> 9415.45s]  I get it. This is how long it takes, huh? What do you guys do when I go BRB?
[9416.09s -> 9430.76s]  What do you guys do? Go pee? Do you leave too? I'm gonna laugh my ass off if it's the whole
[9430.76s -> 9453.45s]  five minutes. That'd be great. He's back. Fuck. He's back. Oh, so far these have been fucking
[9453.45s -> 9470.06s]  fantastic. That was a turbo room. He's back. He's back. Yeah. All right. So coming up next,
[9470.06s -> 9477.75s]  this one is called we'll be back. Hyper dimension. Germania Elbertson breaker.
[9478.65s -> 9485.98s]  What? Sounds good to me. All we need is a baseball video. Already got an interesting start.
[9485.98s -> 9492.41s]  All we need is a baseball video. That's true. And you'll get a laugh. Three, two, one. Here we go.
[9496.73s -> 9497.85s]  Life is paint.
[9539.85s -> 9540.89s]  That was quick.
[9591.58s -> 9592.62s]  I gotta see this one again.
[9600.44s -> 9615.32s]  This is, I love this. This one is called images of German 985 real. Do not watch at night.
[9616.20s -> 9637.67s]  Hopefully it's not night, wherever any of you are. Oh, we're getting close. Star Wars shirt ends
[9637.67s -> 9645.30s]  this whole thing. Terrible aim ends this whole thing. The lion pose ends this whole thing.
[9646.02s -> 9672.30s]  MS DOS games. Um, replace this line with your specific CD-ROM driver line. You only need to
[9672.30s -> 9682.76s]  use this line with DOS six on a CD-ROM to book. Oh yeah. You had to punch in some shit, right?
[9682.76s -> 9692.12s]  Because the manual track instruction didn't work. Course one. Yeah. Course quiz. Before playing the
[9692.12s -> 9696.28s]  game, you'll be asked to identify a piece of track from one of the five courses. Ignore the page
[9696.28s -> 9702.20s]  reference. Use your mouse pointer with the correct piece. A 10. God damn it. G seven seven.
[9707.10s -> 9724.79s]  That's a bingo. That's a bingo. Hold on. Let me stunt driver. Hold on. Let's,
[9725.51s -> 9737.35s]  let's do this together. Course quiz. On course two, page 40. On course two, what is the piece
[9738.54s -> 9754.12s]  at location? Question mark. Course two. What is the piece at location? I five. I said three hours,
[9754.12s -> 9764.97s]  right? I said within three hours if it happens. I needed 15 more minutes. Course two. I five. I can't
[9767.61s -> 9773.53s]  is it one, two, three, four, five. Yeah, this is like, this is me meaning that I can't play the game.
[9773.53s -> 9791.61s]  Little oil can on the right. Straight line with an oil can on the right. I think it's this one. Hold on.
[9795.11s -> 9819.14s]  All right, here we go. How do you drive? Hold on. I got my hand on it. Control,
[9819.14s -> 9840.26s]  alt, p, q, r. R is, I fucked it up. It's all right.
[9846.23s -> 9857.29s]  You're going the wrong way. Scream. Turn the car around. Q. How do I gear it into,
[9858.09s -> 9877.29s]  got it. Get it out of neutral. I can't put it in first gear.
[9877.29s -> 9907.22s]  Oh, no. Watch out for the skittles. Let's go. We're in the M&M's candy world. Oh my god.
[9907.22s -> 9919.69s]  Jerma Gaming. Oh my god. I can't believe it. Oh my god. Dude, Jerma. D, S, A. 200 community
[9919.69s -> 9924.25s]  fucking subs. D. I really didn't think this was gonna happen. W. I thought I was, I didn't think
[9924.25s -> 9934.90s]  this was gonna happen. There's too many variables. R, Q, tab, shift, space, press one.
[9937.46s -> 9960.09s]  Not the candies. Oh, I just ran over everybody. Fill it up. Let's go. Fill it up. What just
[9960.09s -> 9983.13s]  happened? Oh, it's a new, new stream. What the fuck is happening? I can't turn off the crop.
[9983.69s -> 10004.04s]  Hold on. Why is this going, why is there like fart noises? Okay, so.
[10027.42s -> 10034.49s]  I think, I think, I think I just got like shut off. I tried to do it again. I just tried to
[10034.49s -> 10048.90s]  do it again and I think they just like banned me. Hold on. Wait, wait, hold on a second. Hold on.
[10048.90s -> 10050.14s]  Hold on.
[10055.05s -> 10063.10s]  PayPal fraud alert. Are you trying to do this? Oh, Gabe Newell from Half Life
[10063.10s -> 10074.95s]  Softworks. I got a PayPal fraud alert. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Whoa. Okay, so what,
[10074.95s -> 10080.15s]  everybody needs to settle down here. Okay. Yes, I'm Gabe Newell, I am. Okay, very much. Thank you.
[10082.02s -> 10086.02s]  Yeah, okay, here we are. It was like, hey, by the way, somebody's done like,
[10086.10s -> 10092.18s]  like, more than $1,000 on your PayPal account. Wow, interesting. Wow. Is this you, dude?
[10093.06s -> 10102.06s]  Yeah, it's me. Yeah, it's me. Hold on. Oh my god, another somebody else did it.
[10104.74s -> 10112.65s]  We are sorry. Let's go. We are delaying our new game to 2013. Hold on, I got fraud alerted. Yeah,
[10112.65s -> 10121.94s]  I know. Not many of you here today, unfortunately. We're delaying our new game to 2013. There's 100
[10121.94s -> 10126.26s]  subs from Austin Plains. A few days ago. Fucking 100. A few days later. Freddie gave 100. When we
[10126.26s -> 10131.38s]  reached out to Warner Brothers, we were assured the delay would be brought under control,
[10132.26s -> 10137.38s]  at least for now. But no further information was forthcoming. Hold on, I have changed. At some
[10137.38s -> 10144.98s]  point in 2011, we also came across an official FAQ from Warner Brothers that stated. Let's do it
[10144.98s -> 10149.14s]  again. We would like to thank you for your great love and support of the Kingdom Hearts franchise.
[10149.14s -> 10154.10s]  What the fuck is happening on this stream? Somebody else gave 100. I just gave 100. Did it
[10154.10s -> 10162.42s]  go through? Holy shit, every single person is going to get subbed on this channel. Every single
[10162.42s -> 10173.46s]  fucking person will be subbed in this chat right now. Jesus Christ, who just did that?
[10182.31s -> 10187.27s]  The fact that this series takes on so many different forms, including the addition of a
[10187.27s -> 10193.35s]  new game feature. I'm losing my mind right now. I can't even take me talking. Reads the press release.
[10194.39s -> 10201.48s]  This is precisely what we'd like to introduce. I'm losing my fucking mind. Who just gave the 100
[10201.48s -> 10217.66s]  subs besides me? And that is all. Thank you. It was Abe Kashim. Fuck you. Yeah, I've wanted to say it
[10217.66s -> 10228.90s]  for a very long time. Fuck you all. I got 100 more to do and that's it. 100 more subs. This is
[10228.90s -> 10259.93s]  500 here. How could he say something like that? 35 more seconds. No, god damn it. I got a circle
[10259.93s -> 10268.81s]  in scream, by the way. There's been at least three screams. No, that's like the meme. Like my brain just
[10268.81s -> 10285.43s]  typed the thing that's the meme. What a fucking idiot. What an asshole. Where are we going?
[10285.43s -> 10296.18s]  Where are we going? I get another alert from people. No, no, no. Of all the places to go.
[10296.18s -> 10306.68s]  That guy. No, not the Karazhan stream. That is a geared up tank. This is a 0.52%. The worst stream of
[10306.68s -> 10309.88s]  all time. Just got queued up here. It's just walking around side by side. No, no, no, no.
[10309.88s -> 10316.46s]  Kill it, Danette. You tripped it. You tripped it. You tripped it. Is he DPS or heals?
[10316.46s -> 10324.55s]  Holy shit. This is the worst. This is the worst stream I've ever done. I can't fucking believe
[10324.55s -> 10333.51s]  Karazhan is here. All right, just need a healer. Just need a healer. The one time I played WoW on
[10333.51s -> 10340.20s]  stream. Yeah, sanctuaries are where the Horde and Alliance can both be. And they do not. Dude,
[10340.20s -> 10346.28s]  what did I forget? My PayPal password? I can't even get into my PayPal. I'm like locked out of
[10346.28s -> 10357.42s]  my PayPal. Shatterer, Shatrath City, whatever it's called. And we're going to Blackrock Hold.
[10357.42s -> 10363.83s]  I might get turned off for 24 hours. I think I just got turned off for 24 hours. We'll finish
[10365.38s -> 10378.22s]  in. Hey, come on, PayPal. I got the money. Over the edge. Heal us with your laugh. Oh, God. Stop,
[10378.22s -> 10382.70s]  Jeremy. Did it work? Walking around and fucking in. Yeah, Burning Crusade was the first time.
[10382.70s -> 10394.94s]  New friend. It's cool. You watched me from the toilet. Well, hi. Okay, I think we're good.
[10395.58s -> 10403.10s]  Sanctuary was the last Dalaran in Wrath. Yeah. Dermot, what's your eye level? Who the fuck is
[10403.10s -> 10415.69s]  talking? 854. Oh, that's MLC Stealth. What's yours? There you go. 500 community subs. I'm a man of
[10415.69s -> 10423.96s]  my fucking work. 856. Thank you. What the heck? Oh, this stream sucks such ass. Like I'm going to
[10423.96s -> 10433.32s]  use my third video that I'm using. I'm using my Veto. Wow. Yeah, we just need a healer and then
[10433.32s -> 10440.33s]  we can get going. It's going to be this for like another 15 straight minutes. The Bloodhouse
[10441.29s -> 10456.23s]  vendor. Where is he? That's boo. I'll heal if you can't find anyone. I can't believe that. That
[10456.23s -> 10463.30s]  means you're going to have to get in here. Dodged a sub. You sound depressed in this video. Yeah,
[10463.30s -> 10469.69s]  because I'm playing Warcraft on stream. Bit too stuffy to talk. Oh, it's hard to be excited
[10469.69s -> 10476.66s]  about this game. He's new to Felforge. If I'm completely honest with you in that case. Yeah,
[10476.66s -> 10486.54s]  boo is sick. He can't really talk, but he can heal. I'm going to give it like another wipe the
[10487.10s -> 10492.70s]  after I check out the vendor. If nobody, not even kidding. This is the worst stream I've ever done
[10492.70s -> 10507.00s]  in 10 years. This person over here. No, this is the worst stream I've ever done. I got one more
[10507.00s -> 10517.94s]  Veto. My God. 200 order resources for one. Oh, nobody cares. Look at my inventory. Holy fuck.
[10517.94s -> 10521.94s]  It's so bad. Look at how bad that looks. I never do the world quest. They give it. Why do you have
[10521.94s -> 10525.46s]  this? Why do you have that in your backpack? Resources? Why is it in your backpack? There's
[10525.46s -> 10538.23s]  15 teeth in here. Delete the teeth. It's 15 teeth. 10. Oh, my. Nobody wants to watch this shit unless
[10538.23s -> 10542.07s]  you know what you're doing. I have like a shit load. I think I have like, I have like at least
[10542.07s -> 10548.09s]  like 40 or 50. I'm like on this character, bottom tier player and I don't even know what I'm doing.
[10548.09s -> 10553.61s]  And I, I, I still, I, I still click the mouse on moves. Got a lot of money. That was a lot of
[10553.61s -> 10560.97s]  money back then. Holy shit. Go kill the world boss. We could do that while we wait eight hours of this
[10562.41s -> 10565.83s]  Now, let's just do that. Let's go. Let's go kill the world boss. Yes, this was.
[10567.13s -> 10573.32s]  25,000 gold was not a lot of money. Four years ago. Five years ago. Yes, it was. You guys,
[10573.32s -> 10577.72s]  there's always an auto cam. That was, that was a decent amount of money at the end of the stream.
[10577.72s -> 10586.34s]  That's not going to be for a long time. High mountain, right? Yeah. Guys that are here for the
[10586.34s -> 10592.73s]  dungeon. We're going to just go get the world boss real quick. Oh yeah. This is when MLC self was
[10592.73s -> 10599.29s]  like snorting up the fucking boogers all stream. I remember. Yeah. I remember this. That was another
[10599.29s -> 10606.70s]  reason why this stream was so mad. Where are you going to fly to Stonehoof for? It was like sick.
[10615.16s -> 10623.22s]  Uh, stop. Where are you? I'm watching wrestling. Okay. I'm watching what you should be watching.
[10623.22s -> 10628.58s]  You need to get like geared up for this Sunday. Hell in a cell where you're not going to know any
[10628.58s -> 10633.86s]  of the story. I love how fucking tuned out you are right now. Yeah. Wait. Yeah. What are you saying?
[10633.86s -> 10638.58s]  I'm saying where do you, where are you flying to to do the world? To iron horn enclave, which is
[10638.58s -> 10648.76s]  the high mountain. I'm also about to blow my nose. I'm going to blow my nose. No. I fucking told you.
[10648.76s -> 10659.08s]  I told you this is what happened. I told you. What time is it? It's the three PM. It's Alex.
[10664.12s -> 10679.64s]  What? Wrestling bosses and wow. My God. This is so boring. It wasn't even that loud. Oh,
[10679.64s -> 10686.46s]  it got louder progressively. This is excruciating. Who did what again? He went like, and then he went
[10686.62s -> 10703.08s]  and action cam might be cool for melee. You can message people across realm, but you have to add
[10703.08s -> 10713.46s]  the realm that they're in as well as the name. Who's here? Who is it? Who goes there? Hello stream.
[10713.46s -> 10723.80s]  Oh, hi. I just woke up. You sound like you got a raspy voice. Well, if you want to do carousel
[10725.24s -> 10732.92s]  voice has actually been getting better. That is you want to do carousel attunement where you have
[10732.92s -> 10736.52s]  to do. Why is that covering the whole screen? I did hear that there was a big,
[10737.72s -> 10744.20s]  a big deal. Thanks fucking God. We're out of here. Thank you, Lord. Get us the fuck out of here.
[10744.20s -> 10752.15s]  We're up here. 74. Let me, uh, let me just give me one second. I want to check the patch.
[10752.79s -> 10762.63s]  Now we're in the Punisher. We got a bad uncut patch. I mean, it's, we are, it's already done.
[10762.63s -> 10769.77s]  We already did this. It's already over the gore level setting. It's high or none. I already
[10769.77s -> 10781.14s]  changed it. What about a full blackout? A full blackout is just, I mean,
[10782.34s -> 10790.63s]  that's going to be very difficult to do. Go for double bingo. No, no, I can't give any more subs.
[10791.83s -> 10797.83s]  PayPal is going to seriously like call me. If I give another hundred community subs,
[10797.83s -> 10802.23s]  I'm going to get called by PayPal. They're going to be like, Hey dude, like somebody guaranteed
[10802.23s -> 10807.51s]  hack your account. Guaranteed. I'm going to be like, no, they didn't actually have this one.
[10810.50s -> 10816.02s]  PC gaming with a gore patch 3.5, but honest to God, there was a lot of money that came in.
[10816.02s -> 10821.06s]  Yeah. There was like three or four other people that gave $50 to a hundred subs.
[10821.06s -> 10826.52s]  It was fucking crazy. What happened? It was almost a thousand subs brought in during that
[10826.52s -> 10834.86s]  whole debacle. Uninstall the old one. How do you uninstall the old patch? Isn't it like a hook into
[10834.86s -> 10842.20s]  can I just remove the exe here and that'll be fine. Remove the, what am I talking about?
[10842.84s -> 10846.04s]  Yeah. If you didn't believe the technical difficulties, we're going to happen.
[10846.68s -> 10852.12s]  It happened right now. I have a backup of everything, but that's doesn't include the,
[10852.12s -> 10856.76s]  yeah, that's absolutely. Yeah, but I got to know this. This is a full on bingo profile
[10856.76s -> 10862.44s]  over here without any fucking around. I'm going to copy this profile and move it over here. I'm
[10862.44s -> 10875.19s]  going to try this patch profile paste, replace this file, do more just for fun. Yeah. We don't
[10875.19s -> 10879.35s]  need the bingo anymore. Gore patch 3.5. I'm just going to start skipping around.
[10884.22s -> 10889.02s]  Congratulations to those that got the community subs and congratulations to me for just paying
[10889.02s -> 10898.66s]  myself money and giving a bunch of it to Twitch. We are going to turn off the, you can eat a lot
[10898.66s -> 10902.90s]  of it and not really feel that guilty, but it's high in fat. Just be careful. Don't go crazy.
[10905.11s -> 10908.71s]  What, what is it? You don't want to like cause like a stomach problem or like a digestive issue
[10908.71s -> 10911.35s]  for yourself. If you're just like, I'm going to eat a jar of peanut butter every day.
[10912.31s -> 10916.58s]  No, that peanut butter is good for you. High quality proteins, especially after you fucking
[10916.58s -> 10927.08s]  work out. This is the Africa. I used to like to do a spoonful of tahini before bed. Yeah. Okay.
[10927.08s -> 10933.51s]  Next. This thing, this is not going to fit in a priority box. This will, this will not fit in
[10933.51s -> 10950.23s]  the box. It's massive. Destroy all humans. He's going to get a pub G win. That was your last
[10950.23s -> 10959.93s]  veto. What? No, the game is over. You won. You guys won the game. Can you buy the dream cast
[10959.93s -> 10965.54s]  is coming with me. This is pretty random stuff is coming with it is a junk company just coming to
[10967.06s -> 10969.38s]  take care of all the stuff that I can't take with me.
[10971.14s -> 10980.55s]  I didn't say Vegas. I can't extract these guys. I don't have that yet. I didn't talk about Vegas.
[10980.55s -> 10987.53s]  I said it's not coming with me here with me. Where didn't we calculate this on stream?
[10989.13s -> 10992.65s]  We did like how the dimensions of the thing. And it said I couldn't ship it. I had to go like,
[10992.65s -> 11001.27s]  get like this. I had to get special treatment. That's not a requirement. Ass hat. We already
[11001.27s -> 11005.37s]  looked at this on stream. I remember we were sitting there. We were looking at like pricing
[11005.37s -> 11017.96s]  for stuff. It was like, is this a shitload of money? He's going to say it's 400 pounds,
[11019.18s -> 11023.50s]  200 or 400. Doesn't matter. I'm talking about shipping my computer with the United's postal
[11023.50s -> 11030.86s]  saver. The United's postal savers. No, I need to transmog these. Leave them.
[11040.79s -> 11052.90s]  It's not worth anal prom with these guys right now. Next. Why you continue to throw rocks at my
[11052.90s -> 11064.31s]  house? I thought we were over that. I wish I could pause this, but I can't. The last Simpsons hit and
[11064.31s -> 11071.27s]  run thing that we saw was talking about people throwing rocks at my house. This is I feel so
[11071.27s -> 11080.49s]  unfulfilled. I'm so unfulfilled. What's the fastest way to lose? Drive into the ocean?
[11087.80s -> 11097.34s]  It was just this level for two hours. You gotta be kidding me. Just drive to the,
[11097.34s -> 11105.67s]  just like go to the power plant, I guess. Yeah, this is the end game here. This is the final
[11105.67s -> 11108.15s]  mission of the game. Just exit the car at the beginning of the mission.
[11113.94s -> 11125.77s]  It might be faster to just beat the missions. Same joke as last week. I was done. It was so
[11125.77s -> 11147.94s]  close. Oh, just wait the 20 seconds. I sound so done. Our number 10. I remember being at our
[11147.94s -> 11153.46s]  number 10 or 11 and we got a big raid that came in and I was not in the game. This is a,
[11153.54s -> 11158.90s]  and I was fucking furious. And I remember we got a huge raid and I had to like prop myself up and
[11158.90s -> 11166.74s]  be like, Hey everybody, welcome to the raid. Hi, thank you. I can't just like, fuck it up.
[11166.74s -> 11176.54s]  Where are we going? L.A. Why is it L.A. Noire again? Where's the crime scene?
[11177.18s -> 11184.02s]  This is part four of L.A. Noire. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's right. That's right. That's
[11184.02s -> 11190.54s]  right. In the fountain, we shall shine. Nope. That'll get rising revenge. No, this is all over
[11190.54s -> 11197.70s]  the place. What are you guys doing? This changes. What is happening right now? As you click maps.
[11200.90s -> 11209.61s]  How is this even possible? 30, 36, 39, 32, 36, 31, 36, 34. What? This doesn't make me sense.
[11213.56s -> 11217.00s]  Oh, I know what's happening. Nevermind. Everyone. People are clicking on both
[11217.00s -> 11222.36s]  because 12, 15,000 people have clicked the screen. Okay. Well, I need to change that.
[11229.91s -> 11234.39s]  One click per user. That's the exact same thing. Yeah.
[11234.39s -> 11241.27s]  Finding more bugs would be nice as well. All right. Well, what's, um, how long have we been
[11241.27s -> 11245.37s]  streaming for? Like two and a half hours, something like that? Yeah, about two hours or so. Nothing.
[11247.06s -> 11251.88s]  When is there anything else you would like to do, my friend, or are you going to want to do?
[11251.88s -> 11258.22s]  It's all up to you. Do you have another game you'd like to play? Um, I mean, we could hop into
[11258.22s -> 11261.26s]  something like GTA if you wanted to, for like an hour or something.
[11262.87s -> 11269.43s]  Oh, it's been two hours. Yeah. 2000, uh, needs a break or something. Just let me know.
[11269.43s -> 11276.49s]  2017, 2016, German. Two hours stream. It's been enough for me. All right. Well, yeah, that's it
[11276.49s -> 11280.33s]  for this, this particular stream. I'm going to take a pee break. I'll be right back. Oh, if you're
[11280.33s -> 11283.53s]  turning off your stream, then I'll turn off. Oh, no, no, no, no. I mean like this like particular
[11283.53s -> 11289.93s]  game. That's what I said. I didn't make it fucking clear enough to me.
[11296.07s -> 11300.55s]  I'm going to pee. I'll be right back. Just enjoy the fucking random bullshit that you see. I'll be
[11300.55s -> 11329.00s]  right back. I'm having so much fun right now. This is perfect. I'm having a blast right now.
[11329.00s -> 11339.35s]  I really am. This is fucking fun. Oh, my like head hurts from just like laughing internally
[11339.35s -> 11343.51s]  right there. First question. God, the receptionist part of the wedding. I did better at this game
[11343.51s -> 11349.06s]  and I love high school. All right. No more fucking jokes. No more messing around. We're going to
[11349.06s -> 11354.18s]  play an action that worsens an already bad situation to set the head, add insult to injury.
[11355.70s -> 11361.03s]  You seem certain it's a, oh man, that's so fucking fun. And you're right.
[11361.03s -> 11370.33s]  Right. Laughing internally. They're going to run out of $100 questions.
[11373.64s -> 11377.96s]  They're going to run out of the $100 questions. Add insult to rights.
[11380.20s -> 11383.00s]  Okay, come on. Give me the $32,000. I got my lifelines.
[11389.80s -> 11392.36s]  It's beautiful. We see the love of your life coming down the aisle.
[11393.72s -> 11396.28s]  According to a well-known proverb, what do many hands make?
[11397.24s -> 11412.26s]  Many hands. I ain't doing it. You know, it didn't happen. Smosh did it. I'm not,
[11412.26s -> 11422.95s]  I don't care if Smosh did this. Well, I don't like, I've never watched Smosh.
[11423.67s -> 11429.67s]  So they did that Pokemon video like nine years ago. All right. What do I do with these two tabs?
[11430.63s -> 11433.83s]  Sweetheart, I know you're watching right now. I'm working on two tabs.
[11434.55s -> 11445.27s]  Can't get waxed. Not going to happen. Hey, sweetie. Not going to happen. All right. Time
[11445.27s -> 11457.37s]  to connect the arms. Wait, what's happening? Hold on. Connect the arms and the orange strings.
[11459.13s -> 11465.59s]  Thread them properly. Take the string from the shoulder strap with the R-zool on it and
[11465.59s -> 11472.90s]  tie it to the arm. Take the string from the shoulder strap with the R-symbol on it.
[11475.42s -> 11479.82s]  For this fucking guy. All right. Hold on. What'd I miss? What? Hold on. What? What? What?
[11479.82s -> 11484.41s]  Hold on. He's so handsome. What happened? What are you talking about?
[11491.35s -> 11509.37s]  Drunk, sweaty. Wait, what? Drunks. Who the fuck is out there?
[11514.14s -> 11524.10s]  Fucking weirdo. Holy shit. That was a fucking pog moment. Holy shit. That was unbelievable.
[11524.66s -> 11536.65s]  Imagine being that quick. That was it. No. The first VR we've seen all night. Thank you,
[11536.65s -> 11557.98s]  Walt Disney. I mean, it's locked. It's too quiet. I'll get it. Hold on. I need to replace this with
[11557.98s -> 11571.38s]  something, obviously. Got to have to come back later. Any other doors? This is so. I'm having
[11571.38s -> 11580.95s]  a blast. This is so fucking fun. Coin. Everybody, thank Lazy Luke for making this possible.
[11581.75s -> 11588.73s]  On a stupid whim of shit that we were talking about. Literally not even a day ago in the
[11588.73s -> 11595.18s]  pre-stream chat. I made a reference to this. Oh, not even a full day ago. And this shit is
[11595.18s -> 11604.50s]  ready to be used now. Not even a full day later. That's unfucking believable. No problems. It
[11604.50s -> 11608.90s]  worked like a fucking charm. Like it's been great. It's been absolutely fucking fantastic.
[11608.90s -> 11615.10s]  I have to like make this coin do something on the wall over there. I'm going to assume. By the way,
[11615.34s -> 11621.88s]  that is sky. If you feel like it, you can do this too. This is available for anyone just to play
[11621.88s -> 11625.64s]  with. We'll figure that out later. If you mean, obviously, you'd just be watching old streams
[11625.64s -> 11640.52s]  and videos, but it is available. Serma.org slash random. You can play with it yourself. Sky Hunter.
[11640.52s -> 11644.84s]  I'm actually going to take a second just because there's a lot of people that probably didn't see
[11644.84s -> 11650.54s]  this in the beginning. Let me just go ahead and do this real quick because there's a lot of people
[11650.54s -> 11655.83s]  that weren't here in the beginning. Oh, dad, can I at least get some tuna fish next time?
[11655.83s -> 11668.18s]  Remember that? Write that down. That's a map. Okay. So if you're curious how this all works.
[11668.18s -> 11678.15s]  So this website is it's Serma.org slash random. This is my entire life on the internet. So this
[11678.15s -> 11684.62s]  is probably like 90% of everything I've ever done. If you click this button, you're going to pull from
[11685.96s -> 11699.59s]  778 streams and 712 videos. So just for the people that weren't here before. Now I know
[11699.59s -> 11703.51s]  that some people that have just trickling in and just like, no, why the fuck would I want to
[11703.51s -> 11710.15s]  skip through 3200 hours for your fucking shitty stream? You don't have to. I'm just the website
[11710.15s -> 11721.85s]  is available for anybody to use. Let's see another shitty stream. Get out quick. Oh, I'm stuck. No,
[11721.85s -> 11742.94s]  get back in. Get in. Someone gifted me a sub. A lot of gifts. It was probably me. In the back.
[11744.14s -> 11754.09s]  It was probably me. What? You will not have the countdown. No, because this is a special
[11754.09s -> 11761.13s]  thing made for the stream. So you can watch as long as you want. And you can just skip
[11761.13s -> 11766.23s]  whenever the fuck you want. Pick another spot. 700,000 games. That's a pretty good one.
[11766.23s -> 11777.80s]  Fuck it. Super Mario maker. Pretty good job. I just wanted that longer than seven seconds.
[11778.60s -> 11792.34s]  This is the McChicken stream. Well, this is, it's a nine hour stream. So
[11794.81s -> 11797.85s]  when are we going to get Jerma's family dinner? Oh, did you just get it?
[11801.58s -> 11806.38s]  Lightning round? No. Okay. We're probably going to pull it back. This is probably going to be the
[11806.38s -> 11812.46s]  end of the stream. Um, just wanted to do something fun today. Just experiment with some stuff.
[11813.34s -> 11819.75s]  We're going to do a lightning round. I will see you guys tomorrow for community content night.
[11820.95s -> 11828.84s]  And it's happening tomorrow. So it's time for a lightning round. Every five seconds,
[11828.84s -> 11839.13s]  we're going to press the button. Here we go. Monster hunter three. I need to kill these things
[11839.13s -> 11844.01s]  anyways. So old. Not a big deal. I think Kim is, this is the first time Kim ever showed up on video.
[11848.15s -> 11851.11s]  Yeah. This is, this is a Kim appearance. The first time ever.
[11857.24s -> 11863.06s]  Whatever. Amid evil part two. You guys have to keep linking shit from my birthday.
[11863.94s -> 11876.44s]  Is it my birthday? When the fuck did I play this? Wasn't this like two months ago? Enter at the
[11876.44s -> 11886.04s]  dungeon. Picket fence credits. And I don't have a single memory. I never played this. I don't have
[11886.04s -> 11891.13s]  a memory of playing this. I didn't. I've never played this. When did I play this? Are you crying?
[11891.77s -> 11898.44s]  Was that your king? Get fucking sod. I've never played this game. When did I play this?
[11899.08s -> 11909.86s]  Uh, wasn't there a chest that I couldn't open? Is there anything else I could buy?
[11909.86s -> 11914.68s]  This is freaking me out. I don't remember ever opening this. I'll try. I'll give it a go. Why not?
[11915.40s -> 11929.69s]  It was just once. That's it? What a monster. This actually might mess me up because it's going to be
[11929.69s -> 11937.29s]  bouncing all over the place. See how much damage it does. 2006. Oh, hello. Let's go. Oh, here's a
[11937.29s -> 11949.03s]  Might and Magic 3. This is the best unit I can make. Worst stream? What? You're bringing in so
[11949.03s -> 11952.87s]  many people. I've just spent so much money. This was not the worst stream of last year. So many
[11952.87s -> 11961.11s]  people. I'm going to win. The turtle wins the race. Did you see the end of that movie?
[11965.21s -> 11976.86s]  Oh, I love this game. Condemn 2. What font is the bandicam font? Oh, wow. We landed on
[11976.94s -> 11982.22s]  not only unregistered hyper cam. Holy shit. What a thing to land on.
[11984.68s -> 11991.00s]  That's that's better. That's much better. Unregistered hyper cam is five times funnier.
[11992.60s -> 12000.31s]  Don't skip. I won't. It's going to skip in a minute. Stop the timer. I can't stop the timer.
[12000.31s -> 12009.56s]  It's going to be down a little bit. Extended. I can't. All right. Somebody extended. Somebody
[12009.56s -> 12019.45s]  extended. OK, I'm ready. All right. That's good. Should be right here. Should be right here.
[12021.37s -> 12042.31s]  There it is. We're having fun on our game. I honestly don't know what's going on. Put dot net.
[12045.78s -> 12046.42s]  Dot net.
[12046.42s -> 12073.91s]  It's got like a weird text to it and it's black. This should be put in the Library of Congress.
[12074.71s -> 12080.22s]  This is staying on for the remainder of the stream. I hope you guys are aware of this.
[12085.13s -> 12091.19s]  It looks a little like glitchy, right? Just put the picture at the top. That's true. I
[12091.19s -> 12098.68s]  could just do that. This belongs in a museum. This is for cultural significance.
[12101.51s -> 12123.59s]  You guys are fucking crazy. It's got to be perfect. All right, let's play. Turn down the stream
[12123.59s -> 12134.58s]  resolution. I don't. This joke is a bit. That's a funny joke. If it wasn't real,
[12135.62s -> 12144.10s]  because it's actually real. Somebody said imagine low quality. OK, imagine if we had just stopped
[12144.10s -> 12150.07s]  watching the Nancy Drew stream, like not even an hour ago. Oh, this would have been the worst
[12150.07s -> 12154.79s]  stream of 2020. That could cause a problem. If I didn't veto that, this would have been the worst
[12154.79s -> 12169.14s]  stream of 2020 for sure. How does this sound? Does this sound fucked up? Are we losing quality?
[12173.86s -> 12178.58s]  I thought about it. It floated around in my brain for a little while. How does that sound?
[12178.58s -> 12197.50s]  To let it play out for an hour and 40 minutes. OK, like that. Remove my pop filter too. OK,
[12197.50s -> 12206.98s]  hold on. I need a fan on the background too. All right, let's do. How about this? I don't even
[12206.98s -> 12215.35s]  know what this is going to do. Imagine if I played a video game. It's going to do. I don't know.
[12215.35s -> 12220.15s]  Half of these clips we'd stop in or just don't know what any of them mean and not even playing
[12220.15s -> 12229.19s]  a video game. I got to remember where these were. Oh, guys, no, I have a much better idea.
[12233.43s -> 12241.74s]  We're turning on the webcam audio. That's some gross hair. People talk shit about the hair I
[12241.74s -> 12248.79s]  have now. I can't pull it in. Really? 2017 hair was way grosser than this. How does it sound now?
[12248.79s -> 12258.33s]  Pretty terrible. That's some gross hair. Wait, I might be able to. I actually think I can. Let's
[12258.33s -> 12272.44s]  see. It was awful lighting. We still have awful lighting. How's this, guys? Hey, hey everybody.
[12272.44s -> 12283.64s]  Yeah, make the quality of the camera terrible too. OK. So I did this video. I'm going to show you
[12283.64s -> 12295.75s]  my new favorite game that I played. Let's make the camera look terrible. What is making the
[12295.75s -> 12301.61s]  quality awful? Didn't I one day? One day wasn't there a scenario where I had my webcam mic plugged
[12301.61s -> 12307.10s]  in and I didn't know for like two hours or something? We can do custom resolution. We're
[12307.10s -> 12318.62s]  going to change that. When was that? That was recently, right? Oh dear. Kiss him. I don't know
[12318.62s -> 12326.26s]  where it went. I'm not going to kiss him. Where did it go? It looked so awful on my screen,
[12326.26s -> 12339.85s]  but it disappeared because it was 160 by 90. Where is it? Pretend to be the mom. Where's the
[12339.85s -> 12355.05s]  camera? It's gone. There is no. Mom is upstairs and you can't hear. Hold on. Let me see if I can.
[12355.05s -> 12369.85s]  Here we go. Almost there. Let me see something real quick. So if I do this, if I go like this,
[12369.85s -> 12382.38s]  is that possible to? OK. Honey? Honey? OK, honey, it's time to come downstairs. Come downstairs
[12382.38s -> 12391.75s]  right now. There's a couple more things we can do. We're going to sharpen the fuck out of this.
[12391.75s -> 12401.53s]  Are you still playing? It's time for dinner. Add an echo? Are you? Are you still playing
[12401.53s -> 12408.65s]  that game downstairs? This looks like I'm from fucking 1930. Is he in a fucking cave?
[12408.65s -> 12412.97s]  And we're going to put a long con on here. I'm going to make it look like a fucking terrible
[12412.97s -> 12430.71s]  streamer. It's time for dinner. Fucking ghost mob. One more thing. What's there? Put up the
[12430.71s -> 12437.59s]  saturation like fucking crazy. Are you streaming? God, I'm going to tell your father about this.
[12437.59s -> 12448.92s]  That's good. That's too high. Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you streaming? Are you?
[12448.92s -> 12453.64s]  How's that? Is that a fight? Is that fine? That's too good. I know. It is pretty good.
[12453.64s -> 12473.69s]  Thanks, Jeremy. Wow. No, that's obvious. That's too obvious. And I got to be in the wrong spot.
[12477.13s -> 12482.57s]  Somebody extend it. Down here? Extend in a few minutes. Extend in a few minutes.
[12482.57s -> 12486.73s]  And I'm going to be like fucking silent. My webcam is going to be in a wicked embarrassing place.
[12487.37s -> 12509.56s]  All right, we're good. Hey, what are you doing? That's good, man. I got to get in my acting mode.
[12509.56s -> 12533.82s]  It's desynced. What are you doing? Holy shit, this looks so fucking bad. Hold on. Let me move this.
[12533.82s -> 12538.38s]  Remember, like everybody needs to fucking be in on this because I need some people are going to
[12538.38s -> 12544.65s]  trickle in randomly and I have to be like a piece of shit. You know what I mean? Okay, that's fine.
[12544.65s -> 12555.98s]  I'm just going to add one more thing. It's so funny because people were. This needs to be.
[12555.98s -> 12561.34s]  People were writing like your stream sucks and shit like that. Like, fuck you, dude.
[12561.34s -> 12569.61s]  Maybe I can. Yes, I can. Can I? Oh, fuck, dude. Oh, my God. It's about to get so much worse.
[12569.61s -> 12576.34s]  I'm apologizing in advance. This is going to look fucking terrible.
[12576.34s -> 12580.02s]  I'm going to fuck up the footage, too. A lot of people were in on it. It was awesome.
[12580.02s -> 12597.53s]  Good call. If you came to this stream that was this one, this person is view-botting,
[12597.53s -> 12601.61s]  right? If they were like at this point, this is like two or three years ago, something like that.
[12601.61s -> 12605.91s]  There was probably what? Fifteen hundred, two thousand people watching this stream.
[12605.91s -> 12610.71s]  Like you're a view-botting fuck. We need to pass it through one more time. You are a view-botter
[12610.71s -> 12616.62s]  if you have a stream like this that has like three thousand people on it, right? Like you have,
[12616.62s -> 12625.22s]  like there's no way you don't have an unregistered Hypercam 2 stream. Holy shit. This looks, look at
[12625.22s -> 12630.41s]  this. Look, you can even see it. You can see like the pixels moving. Imagine how angry you'd be if
[12630.41s -> 12641.05s]  you came to this stream and you saw that this guy had like a hundred and forty p quality and he was
[12641.05s -> 12653.62s]  just like blowing his nose and shit. I thought this was real. I'm serious. Was this one of your
[12653.62s -> 12671.13s]  first streams? That makes me so happy. By the way, this is like, this is like irreversible.
[12671.13s -> 12675.05s]  Quick, extend it. All right. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. All right. Extend it one more time.
[12675.05s -> 12681.58s]  Extend it one more time. Room lights. Yep. Extend it. Some of you guys have a shitload of
[12681.58s -> 12691.62s]  room lights. Turn off the light. Yep. You got to be sitting in a dark room, completely empty.
[12691.62s -> 12695.14s]  I'm going to turn these off, at least low enough where it looks really fucking creepy. And like,
[12695.14s -> 12700.06s]  I don't, I don't know what I'm doing. And then we're going to play and everybody needs to,
[12700.06s -> 12705.40s]  you guys need to be in on this because somebody, somebody eventually is going to come to the stream
[12705.40s -> 12714.82s]  and be like, what the fuck is going on here? Why does this guy have any viewers? I see. I told you.
[12714.82s -> 12721.88s]  No, that has to be it. I get it. I look like a fucking serial killer. Okay. Do everyone pretend
[12721.88s -> 12736.18s]  to be bots? Right. Right. The bot messages. How's that? Oh, wow, man. Cool kill. This is such a fun,
[12736.18s -> 12744.94s]  epic stream. Smiley face. Same joke. No, I'm laughing. That was somebody in chat that said that.
[12744.94s -> 12766.50s]  I'm laughing at a chat joke from like three years ago. I don't know what I did. I have to go over
[12766.50s -> 12829.61s]  here. No, this guy here. Fuck, man. Fucking. How do I go up there? What? What are you doing?
[12829.69s -> 12839.29s]  No, I'll go to bed in like an hour. It's two a.m. Yeah. Okay. I'll be up in like 20 minutes.
[12890.57s -> 12895.50s]  No, it's not what I wanted to do.
[12932.44s -> 12935.94s]  Perhaps it's your drinking. My drinking is not an issue.
[12935.94s -> 12944.39s]  I'll go get this processed. In the meantime, Farrell wants to see you in his office for a mission.
[12945.83s -> 12947.85s]  Fucking it. Keep your cool.
[12951.61s -> 12956.33s]  People in the chat right now. Yo. Like pretending that this is happening right now.
[12956.97s -> 12972.74s]  Dude, like, oh, pog, dude. Nice shot. Like, what the fuck? Oh, you guys are going to kill me one day.
[12973.54s -> 12977.14s]  You're going to kill me one day. I'm going to die on stream one day from something like that.
[12977.14s -> 12981.93s]  Of course, I take like a sip of fucking water. What is what? What the fuck am I thinking?
[12982.97s -> 12996.74s]  Is it weird that I don't want to stop doing this? Nice shot, man.
[12999.30s -> 13003.94s]  Keep doing it. All right. I'm going to give I'm going to make a timer for like Siri.
[13003.94s -> 13010.63s]  I took a sip of water and choked on it. I got one more. I got one more bit I want to do.
[13011.51s -> 13017.75s]  No, no more bits. No more bits. Let's get the fuck out of here. Next. Next. Right now.
[13017.75s -> 13027.37s]  I can't. I can't climb this. I mean, there are no bricks.
[13029.21s -> 13032.17s]  Is this guy home? I don't even know if this guy's home.
[13032.89s -> 13040.42s]  No, veto this one, too. That's what I get for reading fucking chat during something like that.
[13041.62s -> 13043.94s]  Tell me you guys say the funniest fucking shit, I swear to God.
[13044.74s -> 13048.30s]  Glacial crystals. I can't pick up more than one of these.
[13053.24s -> 13059.99s]  Skip terraria. Fine. That's some of my favorite means of travel. I'm glad you're bringing it up.
[13060.87s -> 13067.03s]  Red Dead Online with Vinny. But before we before we do that, I want to also say there's a game
[13067.03s -> 13071.67s]  called Rust that just implemented hot air balloons. Oh, God. Are you serious? Yes.
[13072.55s -> 13077.43s]  So many technical problems with this one. Let me give me one second. I have to say hello to
[13077.43s -> 13081.75s]  somebody. Somebody's knocked on my door. I got to say hello to them. Hold on. What? Hey, it's you
[13081.75s -> 13092.36s]  guys. It's my stream. My stream chat. I'm half expecting this to be. It's not. I just want to
[13092.36s -> 13098.04s]  say hello playing Red Dead Online Pog. That's up. The simple things make me fucking laugh.
[13099.56s -> 13103.90s]  How you doing? Oh, it's me, Elvis. Vinny Vinesauce.
[13105.90s -> 13111.10s]  My hair is fucking really good. That was really I just that was really good. I had to come back
[13111.10s -> 13115.66s]  and say that I'm half expecting this to be a skit. And you threw me all off. I had a fucking
[13115.66s -> 13124.10s]  clown here. Hit that sniper. Dude, that sniper is like going like this. What the hell is your
[13124.10s -> 13135.40s]  medic doing back here? Walk into it. Now, you lucky, rare, very rare, extraordinarily rare.
[13135.40s -> 13139.64s]  So if you're watching this right now, I am currently in North Carolina visiting my sister.
[13140.36s -> 13144.84s]  Some of you old subscribers will know that I do that every now and then. I think I went there
[13144.84s -> 13149.96s]  last time during Thanksgiving. What am I talking about? I'm in this. I'm what? What? I'm in the
[13149.96s -> 13156.49s]  same room that I was. Come here. Oh, this must be the scheduled upload. A scheduled upload.
[13156.49s -> 13160.01s]  It was a really good time. It's a really beautiful house. Really beautiful place down there in North
[13160.01s -> 13169.54s]  Carolina. Before he gets that stupid thing off, I'm supposed to hit him. I don't even tell you the
[13169.54s -> 13173.86s]  load that I'm using either. I'm using my sister doesn't live in North Carolina anymore. Regular,
[13173.86s -> 13179.82s]  just standard flamethrower and the power jack. We need to push this point. We need to get rid
[13179.82s -> 13185.48s]  of that sentry. Can we take it out? Can I get it right now? Come on. Keep messing with that engineer.
[13185.48s -> 13193.05s]  Yes. How did I not hit him with that? I'm not going to say anything, but it's open. No.
[13194.95s -> 13199.91s]  Get on zip point. Hello. There you go. What's going on, medic? Thank you for the heels.
[13200.79s -> 13212.65s]  Much appreciate. Damn it. Shouldn't have done that. Mr. Winslow. Getting out of here after this,
[13212.65s -> 13219.34s]  I think. I think I'm done after this one. That's not the case. You can't be AFK, man.
[13219.34s -> 13228.84s]  God, that like, I drank water went down into my lungs. I just like raised in water. Why?
[13228.84s -> 13244.25s]  What was that lag? Oh, man. Oh, I was just choked. Wow. I can't believe I actually killed that son
[13244.25s -> 13250.17s]  of a bitch. Get rid of that sentry. Come on. Yeah. Tan him again. Do it again. Keep messing
[13250.17s -> 13256.25s]  with that engineer. Keep messing with him. Yes. What? I said a bad word. Need some help here.
[13256.25s -> 13260.33s]  This is post. Need some help here. Look, this is not the super meat boy playthrough. Get me out of
[13260.33s -> 13269.93s]  it. Damn it. I swore. Oh, heavies. It's in that cup. We got to get on that point. Big time. How
[13269.93s -> 13278.58s]  many sentries are over there? I'm going to go around the left side this time. No, no, no.
[13279.35s -> 13285.62s]  Where are you going? You're not going to. This guy's probably going to kill me. No, I'm going to miss,
[13285.62s -> 13293.48s]  but that's all right. Cause he's where is he? Where the hell does this guy go? I'll find you.
[13293.48s -> 13301.13s]  And when I find you, you're going to get your, your face ripped off. I'll take it. I'll take it.
[13301.13s -> 13307.58s]  How can I not hit the guy that's standing still? Why am I so red? Why are they both doing that?
[13307.58s -> 13316.49s]  Why are they both doing this? Fucking red. How many is it going to take to kill this son of a.
[13316.49s -> 13328.34s]  All right. Fine. I'll just smash you. You want to get smashed? Oh my God. That was terrifying.
[13331.74s -> 13338.55s]  Didn't even need to hit him. We're going to lose. Come on. I think I look better now.
[13338.55s -> 13343.80s]  Give me those heels. Just being honest. Turn around. Turn around, man. I got to try and kill
[13343.80s -> 13351.98s]  that engineer. That's what I wanted. Get him. Hit him. I'm trying to wait for him just to come
[13351.98s -> 13356.87s]  across the middle. It's a different person. This is not good. We're so dead. This is what happens
[13356.87s -> 13362.90s]  when you age. We're so dead. Like seven or eight years. Wait. Demoman, go. Quickly. Quickly.
[13362.90s -> 13364.82s]  Quickly. Quickly. Quick. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[13364.82s -> 13372.79s]  This is called aging. Can I get there in 15 seconds? I don't think I'm going to be able to
[13372.79s -> 13380.89s]  get there in 15 seconds. This is seven years ago? What was it exactly? 2011? 2012? What? What? What
[13380.89s -> 13389.94s]  on earth? 2013 maybe? Pops? I landed on top of that guy's head. 2012. This is eight years ago.
[13391.78s -> 13396.10s]  Okay. That's the first time that's ever happened to me. Imagine if I had the man
[13396.10s -> 13401.26s]  treads on. That guy would have been tumor stomped. It's a defense. It looks like a little bit of a
[13401.26s -> 13409.42s]  defense. Nice sentry. Very good start. Sniper. Trying to shoot me in my face. Was I like a
[13409.42s -> 13414.95s]  jacked fuck at this point? Yeah, I was. Maybe he is. Look at the shoulder. Look at the chest.
[13414.95s -> 13419.03s]  I got to get behind him. If I stood up right now, people would just fucking fuck. Somebody just come
[13419.03s -> 13430.82s]  here. Two scouts. I'll wrap around you. Yeah. Give me a heal, man. I need a heal. Need a heal.
[13430.82s -> 13435.98s]  The old German would beat your ass. No, he wouldn't. You are a jumpy little freak. Because the
[13435.98s -> 13441.59s]  new German would run. Close him in here. Close him in big time. No, no, no. Don't think that
[13441.59s -> 13449.58s]  would happen. Everybody get blown out. This guy's got crits. I'm trying to blow people out. Oh,
[13449.58s -> 13459.11s]  run. Get him. Please. Please die. We're going to do 10 in a row. He's still alive. Five seconds
[13459.11s -> 13468.74s]  each. Oh, no. He died that far. That long after I shot him. It's felt like 20 minutes. This is a
[13468.74s -> 13475.24s]  10 minute video. By the way, this is a 10 minute video before doing a 10 minute video. People did
[13475.24s -> 13480.28s]  to game the fucking YouTube ad system. So don't look at that and be like, oh, what a dickhead.
[13480.28s -> 13485.08s]  He's got 10 minutes to get like the four ads. So this is 2012, dude. This is like before ads
[13485.08s -> 13496.39s]  even fucking existed. That medic is just standing back there. Oh, my God. That's the second sick
[13496.39s -> 13503.48s]  shot of the day. Wrap it up and give it to me for Christmas. Get away from the sentry. Get this
[13503.48s -> 13507.88s]  stuff away from the sentry. I got you. Don't worry, buddy. I got you. I was pretty good. I got you.
[13507.88s -> 13513.34s]  I was pretty good. What's next? Well, that's going to be plenty of that. Family feud. This is just
[13513.34s -> 13519.48s]  the shitty family feud. Who's going to play this? I'm going to try to win a game. Get fucking wasted.
[13519.48s -> 13530.41s]  No, no, just to have to get yourself small cup. Put in like 5% vodka and 95% cranberry juice.
[13533.38s -> 13539.40s]  Oh, Merry Christmas. Super spectacular. Which one of these games? Are you guys ready? Here's
[13539.40s -> 13549.16s]  the game of the night. Which one of these games? The only one cost money. One of these 41 games
[13549.16s -> 13557.32s]  was one dollar. Which one is it? Black and white. Part two. Yes. Let's go.
[13565.51s -> 13571.88s]  Where is Murius? I just want to see Murius's face once and I'll skip. All right. Let's see what
[13571.88s -> 13579.96s]  happens. Do they grow? How are we doing over here? I just want to see Murius's face. That's it. That's
[13579.96s -> 13584.66s]  all I care about. No one's even started building this yet. Where is everybody? This is part two.
[13584.66s -> 13590.10s]  We're not going to see him. Somebody build this. Why not? Yes, we will. All right. Jeff Keeley
[13590.90s -> 13598.57s]  build this. You're going to do it now. He was captured. Oh, no, that's right. He was being
[13598.57s -> 13608.57s]  tortured. Let's try to get another one. The Beagle boss here somewhere. Not going to get away.
[13608.57s -> 13615.26s]  Tokyo jungle. This game was really fun. Yep. Oblivion's on the first year of law school.
[13619.13s -> 13623.30s]  I'll hit you up eventually if I ever need you, you know, right? I'm a lawyer in chat.
[13623.30s -> 13631.13s]  You always got to have a good lawyer. Happiness being spread, tearing entire family apart.
[13638.25s -> 13646.06s]  Don't do it. You'll have to apologize if I do it. Oh, I'll do it. I'll do it. Do it.
[13650.63s -> 13655.19s]  This game is a really fun game. This is all just I wish that somebody like a AAA studio would make
[13655.19s -> 13659.67s]  this game. Plus, I keep the level has like 5000 hours to it. That's a good thing. And I keep the
[13659.67s -> 13670.98s]  moves. Monster Ranger. Oh, my goodness. Not good. You would play it again. I already beat it. And
[13670.98s -> 13678.70s]  I beat the whole game. I always got the stupid thing. Yep. Quest. Okay, marketing. It's five.
[13679.66s -> 13690.28s]  Okay. That's that's going to be the the one gas station. This game is so bad.
[13691.00s -> 13698.36s]  Yeah, you know, we got our fill in this game after about two hours, three hours. Excellent.
[13699.40s -> 13705.38s]  What do you mean? Wink Winks? They're not even possible to redeem. I want like a different
[13705.38s -> 13714.92s]  rifle. Maybe I shouldn't have spent all my money on fish. Get the buffet at the Golden Corral.
[13714.92s -> 13719.08s]  When I went yesterday with some other beers, I got a pile of fried chicken. But when I went to
[13719.08s -> 13728.38s]  go for the smiley face fries, I couldn't find any. Oh, here comes a complaint. I kind of just
[13728.38s -> 13749.50s]  try it. It's a cool way to switch. No complaint. That's great. On this game. But I need to charge
[13749.50s -> 13754.54s]  Community Isaac mod. I don't have any money. Anti birth. When did I do this? I'm gonna leave
[13754.54s -> 13760.97s]  it there for now. Who knows the hell that is? I've been around for so long that I did not play this
[13760.97s -> 13766.02s]  game. I did not play this. I didn't play this. Yeah, I used it. It didn't do anything. I've
[13766.02s -> 13771.38s]  been doing this shit for fucking almost 10 years. I did not play anti birth on stream. There's no
[13771.38s -> 13778.10s]  fucking way that I did. I want to play this right now. Blank card card. I want to play this right
[13778.10s -> 13791.72s]  now. Who knows this game? Okay, I'm gonna make a statement here that a lot of people may disagree
[13791.72s -> 13795.72s]  with and they might agree with. Here's the statement. Don't be so hard on yourself. You're
[13795.72s -> 13803.56s]  not gonna die right here. The Binding of Isaac might be within the top 10 of my favorite games
[13803.56s -> 13809.98s]  ever made. I think it might even be it could be top five of like the one of the most fun games
[13809.98s -> 13818.60s]  ever played. This is what I'd make that judgment based on how much time I have in a game. I
[13820.07s -> 13824.95s]  have put so many hours into this game. I love this game so much. I have like probably hundreds and
[13824.95s -> 13830.54s]  hundreds and hundreds maybe even a thousand hours in Binding of Isaac. I was gonna buy a heart but
[13830.54s -> 13835.26s]  you only do that with something that you just love and think it's so much fun. That'd be dumb.
[13835.26s -> 13840.42s]  Should I like start this again and play this again? I feel like this would be a lot of fun to do and
[13840.42s -> 13850.23s]  like not do it for like two hours. I actually played this game for like six to eight hours in
[13850.23s -> 13855.75s]  a stream. I just hit him with a tomato. He should have been vulnerable. It's career suicide. Why?
[13855.75s -> 13874.95s]  What? It's Binding of Isaac. Everybody loves Binding of Isaac. Skip. Skip. Stream in the corner.
[13878.07s -> 13892.79s]  How did we get this again? Am I playing this? Okay. Vampyr. Game sucks. Sounds pretty good.
[13892.79s -> 13901.99s]  And lastly, spooky things. All right. Now, uh, Jerma, as this is your show, would you like to
[13901.99s -> 13908.33s]  kick us off here? I'm gonna go first. You do? All right. Well, I think I'll take 17th century
[13908.33s -> 13915.93s]  poetry for 50, please. All right. Let's uh, let's see what we got here. Extend. John Calvin crafted
[13915.93s -> 13921.21s]  this Christian ideology ideology stressing God's power. I'm not gonna watch this whole thing. It's
[13921.21s -> 13934.46s]  like three and a half hour, four hour stream. Uh, what is, um, you got anything? Dr. Strange? Uh,
[13934.46s -> 13941.66s]  I have no idea. I put face cam on for this. It actually is.
[13946.10s -> 13947.70s]  Why don't I have face cam on for Sam and Mac?
[13953.62s -> 13958.50s]  Got it. The price of paranoia is eternal vigilance. Whoa. We're not going to do that.
[13958.50s -> 13966.50s]  We're not going to do that. That's like a spoiler. No, I don't think it's going to happen again.
[13970.66s -> 13975.06s]  This is like the, what the last level. There's no way it's going to happen again. All right. Two more.
[13976.50s -> 13979.38s]  I'm going to let, no, three more. And the third one is going to play to zero.
[13980.34s -> 14002.57s]  And that's it. And I'll see you tomorrow. One, two, three. No way, right? That's not actually
[14002.57s -> 14019.18s]  going to happen. Is it? Now what do I do? Okay. That should be enough for now that I can't believe
[14019.18s -> 14028.84s]  this. It was meant to be the Nintendo Labo. Nemo Slack. So this goes underneath in here.
[14028.84s -> 14040.47s]  Eight and a half hours. Bye, bye, bye, bye. And then up the hole. Why am I up there? Slide
[14040.47s -> 14050.58s]  the end of the spring through the eyelet from underneath. What the fuck are you doing? Oh,
[14050.58s -> 14054.66s]  that's right. I remember this. Everyone was talking about like my penis and shit. And I,
[14054.66s -> 14058.18s]  I put like a trash bag on my pants because people were talking about like my dick and stuff, right?
[14058.18s -> 14062.50s]  Like, I remember this. I've no, I remember this. Yeah. People were like fucking being chat was
[14062.50s -> 14070.30s]  like all fucked up tonight. Slots on the ocean. What the fuck? Yeah. I put like a plastic bag diaper
[14070.30s -> 14077.54s]  on because people wouldn't shut up about it. I remember this wrong way. What do you mean wrong
[14077.54s -> 14089.27s]  way? That's not the wrong way. This is the right way. This was so much fun. Thank you for watching
[14089.27s -> 14092.39s]  everybody. This we're going to, we're going to, we'll hang out and do the bits and subs and
[14092.39s -> 14100.55s]  everything. But this is very much a very impromptu. This is crazy. I didn't know I was doing this until
[14100.55s -> 14110.70s]  this is going to be an actually functioning fishing rod. No, thanks for watching. Thanks for joining
[14110.70s -> 14115.98s]  me. See, look at the rubber bands. All right. We're going to let it one more. I'm going to click
[14115.98s -> 14125.69s]  it five times in a row hysterical things that happened in this shit. This is like, if you,
[14125.69s -> 14129.53s]  if you just joined us, you're going to want to watch, you're going to want to watch it tomorrow.
[14129.53s -> 14134.01s]  What the heck? All right. It's time for some QWOP.
[14139.38s -> 14146.26s]  So what was my final death count? 25. Oh God. Wait, does it say? No, they've been counting in
[14146.26s -> 14153.88s]  the stream. I'm just looking over and glancing over and seeing. All right. Thanks a lot for playing
[14153.88s -> 14158.84s]  guys. If you played, I'll probably do this again. This was actually pretty damn fun. So thanks for
[14158.84s -> 14165.10s]  coming. If you joined into the game, into the session. So now we're going to play some QWOP.
[14165.10s -> 14176.06s]  And yeah, thanks so much guys. We're going to play. Oh, that was a shot in the face.
[14176.06s -> 14182.25s]  Pull up. How do I get out of here? All right. It's going to be a black screen until I get
[14182.25s -> 14195.35s]  QWOP loaded. Q W O P. QWOP. QWOP. QWOP. QWOP. QWOP. Hey, yo, I love Liberty City. This is ancient.
[14195.99s -> 14203.62s]  This might be one of the oldest things. QWOP is a flash game. It's a flash game where you
[14203.62s -> 14210.18s]  have to use QW and then O P to run. And it is incredibly difficult. Is this the first stream?
[14210.18s -> 14213.94s]  The screen's probably not going to go black. It's probably going to be just my background.
[14213.94s -> 14220.71s]  This has to be one of them. Just my desktop background. I still have that background. All
[14220.71s -> 14232.86s]  right. Let me pull up some QWOP. Let me make sure the stream thing is there. And people think I'm
[14232.86s -> 14243.43s]  bullshit. Oh man, that was funny. I'm bullshit. That was so damn funny. QWOP. QWOP. QWOP. QWOP.
[14243.43s -> 14251.26s]  Dermot, that's a lie. Is it? Why do you think about this? Oh, no, nevermind. I can't do this.
[14251.26s -> 14257.96s]  I got to think about this. I tried to queue it up. Good thing we didn't get to see QWOP.
[14257.96s -> 14275.86s]  Cuphead. No. Skip. Skip. Skip. Skip. Unrailed. Skip. Demon souls. Part one. Skip. This is
[14275.94s -> 14282.07s]  scary pictures. Activity book. Skip. Earth Defense Force. Skip. Dark Souls. Ring City DLC. Skip.
[14282.07s -> 14289.45s]  Boost game. Skip. Mind Show. All right. So, you know, when words just come out, but they mean
[14289.45s -> 14297.56s]  absolutely nothing. Words were just coming out of my mouth and they meant nothing. It was just
[14297.56s -> 14303.00s]  word swoop. It didn't mean anything. It wasn't going anywhere. It was just, it was a run on sentence.
[14318.10s -> 14326.04s]  That's the penis music thing. That's the penis music gift. Hold on. What are you talking about?
[14326.04s -> 14335.69s]  Isn't it? What? Hold on. Ready? Like, holy shit. It actually is. That's not synced.
[14338.44s -> 14342.66s]  Somebody linked up. What a great thing to end on. Game audio. That shouldn't be a thing.
[14345.54s -> 14353.19s]  Video has desync. All right. But how about how much? All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[14357.26s -> 14367.03s]  Technical difficulties. All right. Thanks for watching, everybody. Seriously.
[14368.07s -> 14377.58s]  It was a wild night. Is Vinnie streaming right now? Because I did say that was going to happen
[14377.58s -> 14382.65s]  because it was part of... Okay. All right. We're going to raid Vinnie because it was part of the...
[14383.77s -> 14392.76s]  I did say it in one of the clips, so that's what we have to do. Anyways, let's go back.
[14393.40s -> 14400.14s]  Too early. Thanks for watching. Join us tomorrow. Ooh. Ow. I was a little too close. I got to back
[14400.14s -> 14409.43s]  up. Oh, fuck my hand. God damn it. I got to get a new mic set up. It's fucking freaking me out.
[14415.37s -> 14422.47s]  Okay. So let's, let's go back to earlier today. If you join us for community content night,
[14424.18s -> 14430.07s]  we've got two... We're just hanging out streams in a row. Community content night is people,
[14430.07s -> 14434.71s]  artwork, and videos that people have made based around stuff on the streams and community and
[14434.71s -> 14443.13s]  everything. So it's a good time. I will see you tomorrow. If you're taking off, if you're sticking
[14443.13s -> 14447.05s]  around for a little bit, we'll go over some of these things. I do the bits and the subs and
[14447.05s -> 14454.82s]  everything at the end of a stream. If you are a new viewer. And right now we're going to talk about
[14454.82s -> 14465.42s]  it. Uh, Freddy Dread, $500. Five fucking hundred dollars. That was within 10 minutes of the stream
[14465.42s -> 14475.64s]  starting, which is insane. Thank you, Freddy, for your five hundred fucking bucks and a hundred
[14475.64s -> 14483.88s]  community subs right after that, which is insane. Mitchell, thanks for the thousand bits. I wish I
[14483.88s -> 14487.00s]  had a hundred dollars to give you tonight, partially because you're a huge inspiration,
[14487.00s -> 14492.49s]  an awesome content creator, but also for that amazing Mario Kart rant in the first Sunshine
[14492.49s -> 14496.25s]  VOD. I would pay money to listen to you instead of just sitting in a room ripping bad games,
[14496.25s -> 14509.29s]  a new asshole. No, but here comes a new podcast. No, this is, this is a podcast. It's everything.
[14509.29s -> 14513.98s]  You know what I mean? It could be whatever the fuck we want. Sometimes the stream just stops
[14513.98s -> 14520.23s]  and for 20 straight minutes, we just talk about random shit. So I don't need to do a podcast
[14520.23s -> 14528.36s]  because this stream is such an erratic fucking mess that it just happens sometimes anyway.
[14528.36s -> 14537.50s]  But thank you for the 10 bucks. Goobery Juice, thanks for 250. Jerma Grin, thanks a lot.
[14538.87s -> 14543.11s]  Peaceful Haley, 250. Jeremy, I rated you at the beginning of the stream with 13 viewers and now
[14543.11s -> 14550.22s]  I feel stupid. And I mean, it's literally just your viewers anyway. Never again. That's all right.
[14550.22s -> 14558.68s]  Don't worry. Hey, 13. That's still people. That's still a lot of people. 10 people is a lot of
[14558.68s -> 14563.16s]  people. 100 people is a lot of people. Thousand people is a lot of people. That's fine. Don't
[14563.16s -> 14575.56s]  worry. Don't worry about that. Thanks for doing that. Hey, but more importantly, they were watching
[14575.56s -> 14584.55s]  you, not me. So give yourself a little bit of credit, right? And Anonymous Cheerer, thanks for
[14584.55s -> 14591.62s]  the thousand bits. No message, just a thousand bits. Foxy Grandpa, thanks for the five dollars.
[14591.62s -> 14599.46s]  No message. Back to back, no message, but just lots of money. Edmund Hakari, thanks for the five
[14599.46s -> 14604.26s]  dollars. Watching you melt the lines of old Jerma while pretending it was you was way funnier than
[14604.26s -> 14616.26s]  it should have been. And I thought it would be. 10 out of 10 meta stream. Hey, Icarus Gamers,
[14616.26s -> 14620.62s]  thanks for the 250. Hey, Jerma, I had a weird dream with you in it last night. More dreams.
[14620.62s -> 14625.02s]  You were in a play that was like Clue, where it was a murder mystery, but there was a different
[14625.02s -> 14631.37s]  murderer every time. But it was also competitive. So the actors were competing to get to be the
[14631.37s -> 14636.31s]  murderer. I was hanging out with you backstage and you're about to go to be the murderer,
[14636.31s -> 14642.41s]  but someone else did it first and you got wicked mad, like absolutely seething anger that you got
[14642.41s -> 14657.26s]  kill stole. It was really funny. Add it to the list of Jerma is a psychopath in your dreams.
[14657.26s -> 14661.99s]  Hey, Yenwen, thanks a lot for the 250. They say, hey, Jerma, do you know it's been over a year since
[14661.99s -> 14668.10s]  I sent you my first piece of artwork? Long time. It's pretty crazy when I think back on it,
[14668.10s -> 14672.38s]  especially since that drawing was never intentional. It was a random sketch that
[14672.38s -> 14678.22s]  turned into a fully fledged painting. During the past year, I resigned from being a bartender and
[14678.22s -> 14682.55s]  had begun training as a teacher. I'm really busy and need to go to bed early, so I haven't been
[14682.55s -> 14688.28s]  able to catch many streams nor draw anything serious. Thanks for joining the stream today,
[14688.28s -> 14693.62s]  as well as everyone from the pre-stream chat. It was a lot of fun. Here is the finished image
[14693.62s -> 14703.46s]  that I was working on. Let's put it on screen. If you don't know, Yenwen is an insanely talented
[14703.46s -> 14710.23s]  artist. Some of the most ridiculous paintings we've ever seen have come from Yenwen. I know
[14710.79s -> 14731.77s]  people probably have links of some of the insane shit. How do I save this? Am I this dumb? I don't
[14731.77s -> 14745.83s]  know how to save a photo. Oh, there we go. That was not it. Oh, yes, it was. Yes, it was. It's just
[14745.83s -> 14765.62s]  very high resolution. I was like, wait, it's gray. There we go. Why does Jax have to be so much bigger
[14765.62s -> 14776.18s]  than me? We're the same size. One of them's just smarter in video game knowledge. Thanks a lot,
[14776.18s -> 14789.51s]  Yenwen. This is good shit, as always. This is a big brother reveal. Thank you. It means a lot.
[14793.29s -> 14803.70s]  More great artwork from Yenwen. Goiki gave $50, 5000 bits. We did it, boys. This has me crying.
[14804.26s -> 14809.64s]  Thank you, Goiki. I'm not sure exactly what you were referring to, but I missed your $50,
[14810.44s -> 14819.29s]  and I want to make sure that I did touch upon it. So thank you. Hey, Razlik. Thanks, Razlik,
[14819.29s -> 14824.42s]  for the $5. Dermot, I've been rather ill for the past two months. Watching your streams and videos
[14824.42s -> 14830.23s]  helps me out so much on them sleepless nights. Thank you and much love to you in this community.
[14830.79s -> 14835.59s]  Such a wonderful place. Also, it's my wonderful Scottish friend's birthday today.
[14836.23s -> 14843.98s]  DK. If you could wish him a happy birthday, it'd be awesome. Hey, DK, have a fucking fantastic
[14843.98s -> 14857.77s]  birthday. Happy birthday, DK. Thanks a lot, Razlik. Pifflavor, thanks for the thousand bits. $10.
[14858.41s -> 14863.19s]  Not going to lie, these streams recently have been very epic, in my opinion. Thanks for that.
[14864.15s -> 14867.67s]  I've laughed this much in a while. Also, even though you have so many games on the list,
[14868.39s -> 14876.15s]  play Dead Space. Probably this Halloween. This October, I'll probably do at least one or two of
[14876.15s -> 14880.39s]  the Dead Spaces in a row. That's a Halloween stream. You know what I mean? That's a Halloween
[14880.39s -> 14886.92s]  time stream. Hey, Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50. This stream reminds me of the part in...
[14889.78s -> 14894.26s]  There's a spoiler for a movie. I'm not going to read it because I've got spoilers for a movie,
[14894.90s -> 14902.55s]  and I haven't seen that movie, so I'm not going to read it. Thanks, Gnarly, for the $2.50.
[14904.89s -> 14915.34s]  And then we had 500 community subs from MrGerma985, so thanks, whoever you are.
[14915.34s -> 14926.07s]  Thanks a lot, Germa. What a guy. When the stream is over, I'm going to have to go into my PayPal
[14926.07s -> 14931.72s]  account and turn off and check the fraud department and make sure they know that this is real.
[14931.72s -> 14942.46s]  I can do that right away. But in the middle of that, Goiki gave 20, Austin Atlantis gave 100,
[14943.03s -> 14948.84s]  Abe Cashim gave 100. So there were 200 community fucking subs that were added to that,
[14948.84s -> 14955.82s]  besides my little bet bingo with you guys. So thanks to Austin and to Abe for giving 200
[14955.82s -> 14961.02s]  fucking subs. That's a shitload, and you never expected to give that much money. He's going to
[14961.02s -> 14970.42s]  charge them back. No, I'm not. AveryDropDead gave five. Thank you. RobbieRevolver gave
[14970.42s -> 14975.02s]  a thousand bits. $10. Germa, thank you to you and your team for putting this event together.
[14975.02s -> 14978.46s]  It was fun, and this is why we love you. Looking forward to more creative events in the future.
[14982.87s -> 14989.30s]  This was just lazy Luke just threw this together and not even day. We were jokingly talking about
[14989.30s -> 14993.78s]  this fucking two days ago, and it was just like, oh, hey, by the way, you can just use it now and
[14993.78s -> 15003.98s]  it works flawlessly. By the way, flawlessly. It was not a single problem. Not a single hiccup.
[15003.98s -> 15011.58s]  It's not like, oh, it crashed. We reloaded. Shit worked fucking flawlessly. Everybody thank Lazy
[15011.58s -> 15018.68s]  Luke for throwing together just a goofy idea that we had in this pre-stream chat two days ago
[15018.68s -> 15031.30s]  and made it reality. That's what you should be thanking. But thank you Captain Nemo for the 300
[15031.30s -> 15035.82s]  bits. Germa, you should see if you can leave the random bot running when stream is offline so the
[15035.82s -> 15041.45s]  chat and stream can just be bopping constantly. Even if you aren't around. Well, you guys can
[15041.45s -> 15049.96s]  just use it. It's available at Germa.org slash random. You can just play with it right now.
[15049.96s -> 15058.54s]  That's not an exclusive thing to me. It just pulls data from YouTube and Twitch and everything. So
[15058.54s -> 15066.41s]  you can just play with it if you want. It's a really neat little tool. We are going to put
[15066.41s -> 15070.73s]  the subs on stream and it's going to be very, very, very, very ridiculous. This is going to
[15070.73s -> 15078.39s]  be very fast because I mean, I, I stacked the deck a little bit with 500, but there was still,
[15078.39s -> 15086.26s]  no, we're not doing mind show. That was the wrong, sorry, wrong scene. Sorry about that.
[15086.26s -> 15096.74s]  We're going this way. Although I may have stacked the deck, it still doesn't matter.
[15096.74s -> 15104.10s]  It was fucking hundreds and hundreds of community subs from other, other people like Freddy Dread,
[15104.18s -> 15111.48s]  Abe. There was a thousand fucking subs tonight. So let me get the credits rolling. This is going to
[15111.48s -> 15119.98s]  blow by pretty quickly. Let's see just how fast this goes. I wonder if you're able to even read
[15119.98s -> 15136.44s]  one name in three, two, one, roll them. Oh boy. Nope. Don't think so. Thanks guys. That's a lot
[15136.44s -> 15150.02s]  of people. That's probably more than a thousand today. Jesus. We also had blueberry juice 250.
[15150.02s -> 15156.33s]  Please set it to change every one second. Please. I'm not sure that it could even handle one second
[15156.33s -> 15165.22s]  changes. What's the sub count now? Uh, let's see, let's after tonight, let's see what it is.
[15165.22s -> 15182.98s]  The current sub count right now after today's insanity is 8,500 subs, 85, 81 to be exact after
[15182.98s -> 15189.22s]  today. So take away my 500, which we're just, you know, if you want to talk about stacking the deck,
[15189.22s -> 15211.88s]  so over 8,000, which is fucking crazy and still no new emotes. I know I'm fucking terrible, but
[15212.52s -> 15219.91s]  anyways, uh, it's still about four or five bits left to do. Uh, we have thick neck. Baby gave
[15219.91s -> 15227.35s]  1500 bits, 15 bucks, no message, just a bunch of money that they just slapped onto the stream.
[15227.35s -> 15236.41s]  Thank you. Uh, did we get Mr. Dask? Mr. Dask gave $10,000 bits to no message either. Thank you. Mr.
[15236.41s -> 15242.58s]  Dask Avery drop dead. $5 got home from work early and was able to catch all this amazing stream.
[15242.58s -> 15249.72s]  Thanks to him of being the best guy on Twitch. You're awesome. I'm glad you think that way.
[15252.22s -> 15261.61s]  Thank you. Thanks for saying that. I, that's all I can say. Shout out to the stream archive people.
[15261.61s -> 15269.19s]  That's correct. If the stream archive was not saving and uploading every single VOD ever,
[15269.19s -> 15277.00s]  this also doesn't happen. So huge shout out to the stream archive guys. I'm talking about hundreds
[15277.00s -> 15289.24s]  and hundreds, like 700 fucking uploads, 750 uploads. So thank them too. Uh, Violet Wanderer
[15289.24s -> 15295.13s]  $5. I've got like 700 hours in Binding of Isaac Rebirth. It's one of my favorites too. When is,
[15296.23s -> 15301.50s]  um, what's the new one coming out? Like Redemption or something? It hasn't been a new,
[15303.27s -> 15307.45s]  aren't they taking the anti-birth mod and making it a thing? They're officially putting it in the
[15307.45s -> 15316.74s]  game. What's it called? Like Repentance or something? Yeah, they're adding a final expansion. Repentance.
[15316.74s -> 15320.90s]  Well, when that comes, maybe when that comes out, I'll get back into Binding of Isaac on stream.
[15320.90s -> 15327.86s]  That sounds like a good time to start getting back into it. That sounds like a plan.
[15331.43s -> 15339.45s]  Thank you for the $5. Uh, Pink Karoo, thanks for the $5. Presto Extendo. Thank you.
[15340.90s -> 15345.70s]  Roguy, thanks for the $3. Bro, I finally saved up enough channel points to do a wink on Friday,
[15345.70s -> 15350.76s]  but I didn't do it because you already had face cam on. Now you disable wink. Please accept this
[15350.76s -> 15355.78s]  as entry into the Wink Club. Well, it's funny you bring that up because tomorrow,
[15355.78s -> 15363.14s]  on the stream tomorrow, Winks come back at an insanely discounted price. So you'll have a
[15363.14s -> 15378.52s]  chance to do it tomorrow. What's the price? We'll see. We'll see tomorrow. And then finally Rad,
[15378.52s -> 15382.92s]  Radshly, thanks for the $3. Free dolls. I'm going to be starting my new job next week,
[15382.92s -> 15386.92s]  so I won't be able to catch streams as often. Thank you for all the laughs these past few months.
[15387.72s -> 15395.08s]  Thanks for watching the past few months. Eh, community doesn't exist. Community doesn't exist,
[15395.08s -> 15401.42s]  but I love the people in the fucking community. So thanks for participating. This whole thing is
[15401.42s -> 15407.34s]  impossible without all of you. So thanks for watching. See you tomorrow for Community
[15407.34s -> 15415.21s]  Content Night. Take care. We are going to raid Vinny because obviously I said it earlier,
[15415.21s -> 15425.56s]  so you know, it's part of the deal. Go tell Vinny what's going to say something. See you guys
[15425.56s -> 15434.62s]  tomorrow. Take care. Good night. Thanks for experimenting in this experimental stream,
[15435.26s -> 15444.02s]  and we'll see you tomorrow. Good night, guys. See you soon.
