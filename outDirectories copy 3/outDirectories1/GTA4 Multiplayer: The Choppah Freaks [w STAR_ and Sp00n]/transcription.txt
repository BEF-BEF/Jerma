[2.81s -> 34.34s]  Hey, I'm gonna do a wheelie. I'm just gonna let you laugh. Hey, Jerma. Start game. Private slots max. Jerma! Jerma! Jerma!
[34.34s -> 48.28s]  What? Invite me. I haven't made the game yet. The hemogloba chopper is down here. Wow, I haven't played this game forever.
[48.28s -> 55.56s]  We definitely should not be running to this, by the way, because it's gonna take us ages. I just gotta get to Hibachapa.
[56.56s -> 62.56s]  Hey, I dare you to turn around. I dare you to turn around and shoot Spoon with that shotgun.
[62.56s -> 72.91s]  Hey! Hey! No! No! No! You flipped on my screen and just stood back up. Yeah, me too.
[72.91s -> 81.03s]  I love you. Shoot Jerma. No, don't shoot me. Shoot Jerma. Shoot him in the back of the face. No! No! Don't!
[81.03s -> 87.83s]  He told me to! Yeah! What is this guy? Oh my god, that's a chopper.
[88.83s -> 98.16s]  Dude, there was like a freaking hole and I gotta look at this guy. This guy was in like winter clothing. Maybe it's winter.
[98.16s -> 103.66s]  No, it's like nice out right now. This guy is in a full winter hat. That just whizzed by my screen.
[103.66s -> 111.76s]  Alright, the game is on. No, I'm sorry, I hit the helicopter. Do you think you can get me in this car?
[111.76s -> 121.02s]  Don't run me over. Oh no! I think I can get you, yeah. I didn't mean to do that. I'm so sorry, Spoon.
[121.02s -> 126.84s]  Wait, you want to run in the car and I chase you down onto Helichoop? Yeah, let's see if you can get me.
[126.84s -> 130.84s]  Here, you can start going. Alright, I'm gonna go this way. Here we go.
[142.08s -> 147.54s]  Oh god! Oh, you have it? Yeah, I got a chopper. You gotta get in the car and you gotta escape the chopper.
[147.54s -> 151.54s]  Alright, we're in one in the airfield. You're never gonna get me because it's the best car in the game.
[151.54s -> 157.54s]  Okay. I'll get in my own car. You're probably not gonna find one. I'm gonna find one.
[157.54s -> 162.54s]  Just wait until I play the music in my head of me like chasing you down.
[162.54s -> 170.54s]  How am I gonna hear it in your head, Jerma? I found a bike. Don't worry, I got this. Don't run me over.
[170.54s -> 181.51s]  I'll sell another fit. Oh jeez. I didn't hear the music. Oh man, this is weird.
[181.51s -> 187.51s]  Are you in the chopper right now? Yes. Oh jeez. Oh jeez.
[187.51s -> 191.51s]  It's pretty weird to be in the chopper.
[191.51s -> 194.51s]  He's going to crash without us even being there.
[194.51s -> 197.51s]  Where are you? I'll do it.
[197.51s -> 201.51s]  How high are you? Why are you that high in the air? I don't know, what do I do?
[201.51s -> 207.51s]  Hold S, hold S. Hold S, S. No, no, don't hold it down.
[208.51s -> 213.51s]  Wow. I'm never listening to you again. I didn't mean to like hold S until you die.
[213.51s -> 218.51s]  You still hold S. Yeah, but that means that's like how to like descend.
[218.51s -> 225.76s]  Not like just hold until I die. I'm ready for you to go.
[225.76s -> 232.12s]  Here comes the chase scene.
[232.12s -> 235.12s]  Why are you faster than me? This is not cool.
[235.12s -> 237.55s]  I'm going to get you.
[237.55s -> 243.32s]  How are you faster than a helicopter going, listen to this plane.
[243.32s -> 245.32s]  I was looking the other way.
[245.32s -> 249.32s]  Am I still alive? I'm still alive.
[249.32s -> 252.32s]  Here, I'll give you a ride back to the helicopters. Thanks.
[252.32s -> 256.32s]  Get in. Or not.
[256.32s -> 262.00s]  We're so bad at this. Every time we try to organize something and do something special.
[262.00s -> 267.00s]  I'm going to get the helicopter and you guys just go anywhere and I'll chase you for the rest of the time we're playing and you will die.
[268.00s -> 273.83s]  Spoon, why are you on fire? Because I'm just cool like that.
[273.83s -> 279.35s]  You want me to land on the ambulance? Yeah, try to land right on like the flat part of the ambulance.
[279.35s -> 290.22s]  We need to like hang out. Even if I have like a tea party on the top of the ambulance.
[290.22s -> 293.22s]  That was so lame.
[293.22s -> 297.22s]  That just looked like you jumped into bed.
[297.22s -> 302.22s]  This is a mattress and you just like jumped into bed like ah.
[302.22s -> 304.84s]  That was so anticlimactic.
[304.84s -> 308.17s]  Oh, no. Stop blocking me.
[308.17s -> 311.41s]  All right. You guys want to have like a sumo wrestling fight up here? Yeah, sure.
[311.41s -> 314.41s]  Whoever gets like knocked off the ambulance loses.
[314.41s -> 318.40s]  Spoon, you ready? Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
[322.40s -> 325.82s]  Get in, cousin.
[325.82s -> 328.19s]  Please don't take Gatling gun helicopter.
[328.19s -> 331.19s]  No, I didn't take the Gatling gun helicopter. You know what?
[331.19s -> 334.19s]  No, please. No, please. It's my favorite.
[334.19s -> 337.19s]  You ain't going to get shit.
[337.19s -> 341.00s]  Oh, good job, cousin.
[341.00s -> 344.00s]  I'm not sure. Oh, shit.
[345.00s -> 346.00s]  Wrong button.
[346.00s -> 348.00s]  Don't ask me that. Don't.
[348.00s -> 350.00s]  I don't understand how this makes any sense.
[350.00s -> 352.00s]  It's still there.
[352.00s -> 354.18s]  Why? Why is it still there?
[354.18s -> 356.18s]  I got to destroy it.
[356.18s -> 358.18s]  Why did you destroy mine?
[358.18s -> 360.18s]  I'm going to get it. Come on.
[360.18s -> 362.18s]  Yes.
[363.18s -> 365.18s]  I got it.
[365.18s -> 367.18s]  I am the victor.
[367.18s -> 369.80s]  All right, Spoon, I'm picking you up.
[369.80s -> 372.43s]  No way. I got a helicopter.
[372.43s -> 375.56s]  Is that? Oh, it's respawned.
[375.56s -> 376.56s]  It's respawned. It's respawned.
[376.56s -> 378.56s]  Operation, do not let him get it.
[378.56s -> 380.56s]  Destroy it.
[380.56s -> 382.56s]  I don't think you. I can't. I can't.
[382.56s -> 383.56s]  I'm missing.
[383.56s -> 385.56s]  I'm missing my line up here.
[385.56s -> 387.56s]  He said crash into him.
[387.56s -> 388.80s]  Yes.
[388.80s -> 390.80s]  He said crash into him.
[390.80s -> 392.80s]  I'm on his tail.
[392.80s -> 395.81s]  For Niko.
[396.81s -> 397.81s]  Come here.
[397.81s -> 401.24s]  We are seriously like birds fighting in the air.
[401.24s -> 406.11s]  I'm going to get you. It's going to happen.
[406.11s -> 408.11s]  No.
[408.11s -> 410.11s]  You son of a bitch.
[410.11s -> 413.12s]  I'm actually figuring out how to fly like this.
[413.12s -> 415.12s]  You can actually control it. Oh my God.
[415.12s -> 416.12s]  You got it?
[416.12s -> 418.12s]  I just have to wait for it to turn.
[418.12s -> 422.47s]  You are like a cheap
[422.47s -> 424.47s]  $10 RC helicopter
[424.47s -> 426.47s]  right now.
[426.47s -> 428.47s]  Look at what I got for Christmas today.
[428.47s -> 430.77s]  It's like if I hold
[430.77s -> 432.77s]  the trigger, when it turns
[432.77s -> 434.77s]  in the direction I want to go, it moves that way.
[434.77s -> 436.77s]  I can't believe you are still
[436.77s -> 438.77s]  flying this thing. This is unbelievable.
[438.77s -> 440.77s]  No, he's going to have my view.
[440.77s -> 442.77s]  I'm trying to follow him.
[442.77s -> 445.65s]  Oh, that was not. That was a bad move.
[445.65s -> 450.56s]  What?
[450.56s -> 452.56s]  Get him. Die.
[452.56s -> 454.56s]  Get him. Die.
[454.56s -> 456.87s]  Did he crash? I had to reload.
[456.87s -> 458.87s]  He's reloading.
[458.87s -> 460.87s]  He's right here. He's right here. You got a chance.
[460.87s -> 463.11s]  Niko, come with me. I'm reloading.
[463.11s -> 467.14s]  Take cover.
[467.14s -> 469.14s]  You're down, final boss.
[469.14s -> 472.34s]  Get him.
[472.34s -> 474.34s]  Oh, geez. Oh, God.
[474.34s -> 476.34s]  Run.
[476.34s -> 478.77s]  Oh, no. I got hit by a cousin.
[478.77s -> 480.77s]  That was terrifying.
[480.77s -> 482.77s]  And I got out. I'm out. I'm fine.
[482.77s -> 485.91s]  Die.
[485.91s -> 487.91s]  Did you just jump out?
[487.91s -> 490.85s]  Why did you do that?
[490.85s -> 492.85s]  I thought I could land on
[492.85s -> 494.85s]  the building and be fine, but my dick slammed
[494.85s -> 496.85s]  into it and I kept falling.
