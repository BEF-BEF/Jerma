[6.20s -> 20.57s]  Play FNAF. Okay, which one? Which one? Okay, what do I have? I have... I have Five Nights at Freddy's
[20.57s -> 27.50s]  and Five Nights at Freddy's 2. Five Nights at Freddy's 1? Oh my god, you're trying to get me
[27.50s -> 35.74s]  fucking... Five Nights at Freddy's 1? Alright, let's make a prediction here. I don't think I'm
[35.74s -> 48.41s]  gonna get past the first night or the second night. 2? 2 is better. I'll do 1. I'll do 1. Alright,
[48.41s -> 56.60s]  let's go. I bet you I don't even make it past the first night. You know how I play Five Nights at
[56.60s -> 63.91s]  Freddy's? I close both doors, have both lights on, and I go like this. Cover my eyes, cover my
[64.71s -> 79.61s]  ears like this and just wait. Alright, let's play Five Nights at Freddy's 1. Whatever.
[79.61s -> 96.62s]  This is gonna be loud, isn't it? Does it even have graphic options? No, there's no graphics
[96.62s -> 117.27s]  options in Five Nights at Freddy's 1. Let's see. Is it too loud? I can't even tell if it's being
[117.27s -> 136.81s]  captured. There we go. Alright, here we go. Five Nights at Freddy's 1. What the fuck is happening?
[136.81s -> 144.52s]  Okay, I told you I'm not full of shit. This is a Steam Cloud save file. I didn't get past the
[144.52s -> 156.28s]  first night. You thought I was full of shit? You thought I was making that up? Here we go.
[158.09s -> 171.66s]  Hello! Hello! Hello! Oh, look out! It's Chicky and Foxy and Freddy!
[192.86s -> 199.69s]  No, hold on. I gotta do the right way. It's this. Not like this. My brother taught me this when we
[199.77s -> 206.97s]  were younger. We went to go see the alien ride at Disney World. It was the thing that used to be
[207.77s -> 212.01s]  the Lilo and Stitch ride and it was terrifying. And he's like, dude, is that what you do? You go
[212.01s -> 214.73s]  like this, cover with your pinkies and your eyes and block your ears with your thumbs
[215.45s -> 270.09s]  and you're gonna be fine. Did I make it? How much battery do I have? I even pressed a single
[270.09s -> 277.48s]  button. No, I told you. I got it. Look at it. They ain't getting in. Not on night one.
[282.01s -> 282.81s]  Open the doors. No!
[312.02s -> 313.86s]  Oh, I don't like having the doors open. I hate this game.
[313.94s -> 326.94s]  How did I not get past night one? Isn't that impossible?
[333.83s -> 346.04s]  It's actually impossible. Why did I not do it? You must have been zonked.
[348.73s -> 353.61s]  Why do you treat all video games like a joke? I just beat Cuphead's DLC in like an hour and
[353.61s -> 398.31s]  12 minutes. I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm gonna lose because I wasted all the power. They don't even
[398.31s -> 406.71s]  leave on the first night. They actually don't even leave on the first night. I think Freddy
[406.71s -> 417.37s]  leaves and goes into one other room. Click Freddy's nose in the poster. It's pretty funny.
[418.33s -> 423.96s]  Yeah, so then nobody moves until like three or four a.m. I think Freddy disappears.
[424.60s -> 434.34s]  What's that sound? What is that sound? What's that sound? What's that sound?
[435.06s -> 446.17s]  Did I spawn like a monster or something? I don't know what that fucking sound is.
[446.89s -> 455.77s]  What did I do? You made me spawn something. I never pressed Freddy's fucking nose before.
[456.09s -> 561.02s]  I didn't know. Why would it just quit the game? God damn it. I'm sorry. I fucked up. Can you guys
[561.02s -> 568.06s]  see it? All right. I'm not going to fuck it up. I promise. All right. All right. All right. I can't
[568.06s -> 578.39s]  see chat either. Is it reasonably good? Why did it quit? Stop quitting. All right. Can you see?
[590.90s -> 599.61s]  Hold on a second. Just make a few adjustments to my Herman Miller
[600.33s -> 631.27s]  MBODY chair. Refund this game. Guys, I bought this game like nine years ago. I don't think
[631.27s -> 639.93s]  the refund. I think I'm out of the seven day window. Refund the bet. Oh, so what are you
[639.93s -> 653.06s]  talking about? They would understand. Can you imagine trying to refund a game that you bought
[653.06s -> 660.23s]  10 years ago? I mean, I technically only have an hour and 20 minutes in it. I mean,
[662.04s -> 668.14s]  I didn't really like it that much. I didn't really get to it. Other games kind of took over there.
[669.86s -> 686.95s]  It's actually 14 days. Yeah. Don't play this game. I'm scared. All right. Have they moved yet? No.
[697.02s -> 707.45s]  Oh, I'm running over a thing. POG 87 power left. Yep. What the fuck is going on there? What was
[707.45s -> 713.34s]  that? What happened? Excuse me. What are you talking about? Excuse me. Why did that happen?
[713.98s -> 727.38s]  I've never seen that before. And we're fucking around. Why did I do that? I don't know. I just
[727.38s -> 793.70s]  spawned something. What does that actually do? What does that actually do? Hello. Wait, hold on. Let
[793.70s -> 808.23s]  me see if I can get it. That was close. Give me an Oscar. No, no, no, no, no. It's wrong. I had it
[808.23s -> 825.94s]  wrong. It's like, oh, dude, this is why we're fucked. That fucking Foxy comes out of there.
[825.94s -> 829.72s]  I heard this. My fucking son played this one. Fucking Foxy comes out of there and
[829.72s -> 840.06s]  sprints down the fucking hallway. It was fucked up. No, I never played this before. I don't know.
[850.62s -> 859.53s]  Don't look at Foxy. Oh shit. Somebody fucking moved. They walk down halls and stuff. They
[859.53s -> 868.20s]  fucking walk down the hall. I played it before. I know it. Wait. Oh shit. There it is. Okay.
[870.10s -> 873.54s]  I'll fucking drop this guy if he fucking comes in my... If he comes over to the door,
[873.54s -> 971.08s]  I'm gonna fucking drop him. Ain't nobody getting in here now. That was too soon. I don't think it
[971.08s -> 1036.30s]  was. Oh shit. Get out of here. What happened? What? Close the door. Close the door. Close the
[1036.30s -> 1064.95s]  door. Okay. I'm good. Six aim coming. Oh no. What are you gonna do? Bulletproof glass. Bulletproof
[1064.95s -> 1113.61s]  glass. You ain't getting in bulletproof glass. Who's over here? Oh no. Bulletproof glass. Oh,
[1113.61s -> 1126.90s]  I missed it. Fucking good. I'm fucking good. No, we're good. All right. Night two. This is where
[1126.90s -> 1141.69s]  it gets a little crazy. This is where it gets crazy. I'm not touching anything until at least
[1141.69s -> 1178.89s]  2 a.m. Just get out of the chair and leave. I have a funny idea. What if I just pretend to fall asleep
[1178.89s -> 1185.21s]  on stream? All right. I'm gonna pretend to fall asleep on stream. I'm gonna put a text on the
[1185.21s -> 1192.89s]  bottom that says like, dude, wicked fucking tired. I had a long day and then you're woken up by the
[1192.89s -> 1200.31s]  jump scare. You guys can be like, wake up, dude. Wake the fuck up. Wait, what do I have to do?
[1200.31s -> 1208.20s]  Do I have to do a light? How do I stop that from happening? How do I stop that from happening?
[1208.20s -> 1235.22s]  How do I stop that from happening? Where is this motherfucker? Uh oh. Uh oh. Where are you? Oh.
[1235.22s -> 1306.14s]  Oh, we'll do it on. Oh, we'll do it on night three. Open the doors up. Lights. Why? That's
[1306.14s -> 1404.25s]  extra power. They haven't moved. When's it gonna be 3 a.m.? Dude, it's been 2 a.m. for an hour. Oh,
[1404.25s -> 1418.47s]  shit. Oh, where are you going? All right. You went that way. You're here. All right. What happened?
[1418.47s -> 1494.01s]  I have to keep looking at Foxy, right? Uh oh. What the fuck? What happened? What happened? Is that bad?
[1494.73s -> 1505.91s]  Is that bad? Am I okay? Am I actually, am I okay? Am I, am I okay? Am I all right? Why is it
[1505.91s -> 1529.32s]  happening? Am I all right? What does that mean? I fucking quit the goddamn game. I exited the
[1529.32s -> 1551.02s]  fucking game. No, I didn't. I'm still in. Close the door. All right. I'm good. Is he still there?
[1551.02s -> 1602.66s]  What the fuck are you still doing here, you dick? What the fuck is happening? I don't get it. I
[1602.66s -> 1609.03s]  don't get it. I actually don't get it. I, guys, I've played Five Nights at Freddy's for a shitty
[1609.03s -> 1617.13s]  YouTube video one time and I wasn't even paying attention to the game. All right. Hold on. We're
[1617.13s -> 1639.93s]  doing this though. All right. What should I say? Like really tired today. Not like long day. Just
[1639.93s -> 1671.54s]  chilling with stream. Whatever. Right. Let's do, and the cam is going to be huge too. And I got to
[1671.54s -> 1682.86s]  look realistic. Why would you fucking play Five Nights at Freddy's? Oh yeah. I'll turn the lights
[1682.86s -> 1733.11s]  off. Okay. Hold on. Just like, is that all right? Should it be a little brighter? Hold on. Which,
[1733.11s -> 1740.97s]  yeah. Put the death counter on too. So people think it's automatic. Right. People think it's
[1740.97s -> 1747.03s]  automatically counting the amount of times I die in Five Nights at Freddy's. I've died 600 fucking
[1747.03s -> 1811.50s]  times. Okay. Here we go. Make it 15. That's way too many. Maybe like 30 or like 60 or something.
[1811.50s -> 1820.94s]  Right. 600 means I've been here for a long time. 62. Right. All right. That's fine. All right. Can
[1820.94s -> 1835.18s]  we get some, can I, how about this? All right. That looks good. Let's go. This is going to be
[1835.18s -> 1843.05s]  fucking stupid. Can you guys, can you guys see it? Can you guys, you guys can see it, right?
[1851.32s -> 1859.91s]  Okay. Here we go. Why would you do this?
[1859.91s -> 1908.30s]  Fuck.
[2001.85s -> 2002.25s]  Fuck.
[2003.29s -> 2013.21s]  No, I was so close. Reset, reset. We got to reset. We got to reset. We got to reset. Reset,
[2013.21s -> 2021.75s]  reset, reset, reset, reset. Fuck. You don't know how hard it is to do that. To sit here and know
[2021.75s -> 2028.15s]  that there's like 20,000 people all spamming wake up and shit. And I'm some dumb ass that's
[2028.87s -> 2034.31s]  why do I have an auto redoing Five Nights at Freddy's death counter? And why am I sleeping
[2034.31s -> 2038.39s]  to this? It's, it's too much. It's too much. My brain can't do. All right. I'm going to go. Here
[2038.39s -> 2054.28s]  we go. It's so hard. The bottom text is covered by the game. All right. Go, go, go, go, go, go,
[2054.28s -> 2055.88s]  go. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Good. All right.
[2055.88s -> 2082.07s]  Let's go. I won't fuck it up this time. I swear to God. It's so stupid.
[2096.17s -> 2105.24s]  One more try. I swear to God. I swear. I'll get it. I'm so, it's, I'm so hard. It's so hard.
[2105.24s -> 2116.46s]  You have no idea. Again, again, I promise. I'll get it this time. I promise. I promise. I swear
[2116.46s -> 2141.40s]  to God. I'll get it right now. All right. Everybody shut up. Go and begin fucking telephone.
[2143.64s -> 2149.40s]  It's the stupid telephone that keeps it. It's, it's like the phones ringing in the house
[2150.12s -> 2158.68s]  and I'm sleeping. Someone's trying to reach me so bad. It's just like, Holy shit, dude,
[2158.68s -> 2163.24s]  you're on stream. Get up, wake up, dude. Turn your stream off. Call his fucking landline.
[2170.41s -> 2178.71s]  Dude, I wouldn't call your landline at 10 o'clock, but seriously, man. All right. Here we go. I gotta
[2178.71s -> 2189.18s]  get this. I have to. I have to get this. I will do whatever it fucking takes. It's just the fucking
[2189.18s -> 2205.58s]  phone ringing. Just sitting there. Okay. Dude, wake up. I'm calling your house. Okay. Come on.
[2230.26s -> 2244.55s]  Crazy. God damn it. All right. I got it. Hold on. Oh, fucking hell. I don't know if I can do it.
[2244.55s -> 2253.80s]  I really don't think I can do it. It's too dumb. This is stupid, right? This is really dumb.
[2255.21s -> 2262.10s]  All right. I think I got it out of my system. I had to at this point. Okay. Here we go. You know
[2262.10s -> 2266.02s]  what? It's so loud. I just think of, okay, I gotta get it out. I gotta get it out now.
[2266.02s -> 2277.42s]  Because the whole thing is when the jumpscare happens, I'm going to fucking wake up and it's
[2277.42s -> 2283.02s]  going to be stupid. All right. This is it. I got it. Fuck the phone. It's going to be funny,
[2283.02s -> 2301.96s]  but fucking don't listen to it. Fuck you. I can't mute the phone call. It's so funny.
[2302.52s -> 2306.94s]  That's like the funniest part of this whole thing. Okay. All right.
[2306.94s -> 2350.94s]  All right. I got to get it together. It's after the phone. I'll be, it'll be, it'll be good.
[2350.94s -> 2357.43s]  I just have to get through the phone. Once the phone bit is over, I'll be good. I'll be good.
[2357.43s -> 2362.71s]  It's just that phone part for real. It's
[2464.02s -> 2545.85s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[2577.27s -> 2595.37s]  We got it. Well, let's look, there's a candle in my room. That was so hard to get through that
[2595.37s -> 2613.80s]  third ring. What happened? That was a rare death screen. All right. I don't care. I'm done. Streams
[2613.80s -> 2625.40s]  over. That's fun. That's fun. Yeah. It looks like there's a candle in here. I think that's,
[2625.40s -> 2634.55s]  I think that's the one you go on on. It does look like we could fucking blurry, doesn't it?
[2634.55s -> 2641.56s]  Okay. All right, guys, that's it. I'll see you guys on.
[2644.46s -> 2654.68s]  There's a lot of shit going on. And I have to tell you really, really. All right. I really don't
[2654.68s -> 2662.74s]  want to say this, but it sucks. But I'm just, just in case baseball might need to move again,
[2662.74s -> 2670.90s]  not far, not far, but might need to move another few days. Would it would work in our asses off
[2670.90s -> 2679.82s]  to make sure that we can get what we need. But it's, it's happening within the next like 30 days.
[2679.82s -> 2685.45s]  Okay. I know I keep changing it, but we just keep having things that have to change and keep having
[2685.45s -> 2690.42s]  venue things that have to happen. And some venues need to change. And it's been a whole ordeal.
[2690.42s -> 2696.12s]  We're working on it. So I might have to change it by the way, green screen stuff you have until
[2696.12s -> 2701.72s]  the 18th at 1201 midnight to get your submissions in, go read the rules are in the discord right
[2701.72s -> 2709.42s]  now. What's the green, what's the green screen thing, dude, the green screen stream. We did a
[2709.42s -> 2713.74s]  bunch of shit in front of the green screen. There's three full streams of it. You can do
[2713.74s -> 2719.62s]  whatever you want with some rules and go read those rules. You're going to need them delaying
[2719.62s -> 2726.55s]  it to next year. No, no fucking way. That's not happening. All right. I'll, I'll see you guys in
[2726.55s -> 2731.72s]  a couple of days. Let's see. Maybe I'll see you guys on Tuesday. Yeah. 24th of July, probably
[2731.72s -> 2739.85s]  going to do something. Holly and I might do something. So, so I'll see you guys on the fifth
[2740.41s -> 2747.45s]  Tuesday. I have no idea what we're going to do, but I'm sure we'll do something. Thanks a lot,
[2747.45s -> 2762.02s]  everybody. See you later. Take care of yourselves. Well, we got a few minutes, so we got some time.
[2762.02s -> 2771.70s]  Oh, you can do the mod day. Actually, what a great idea. Maybe I'll do that on Tuesday.
[2771.70s -> 2778.92s]  Just get a bunch of mods for a few games. It just apt to have an absolute puke stream. I think that
[2778.92s -> 2798.79s]  makes sense, right? Tuesday puke stream. I think it makes sense. Yeah. Oh, what was I going to say?
[2815.30s -> 2825.70s]  Elden Ring. Yeah. Okay. I got a question. Does Elden Ring have a bunch of mods? Are there fun
[2825.70s -> 2831.16s]  things to do with Elden Ring and modding? Okay. Because I got to have to take, I'm going to take
[2831.16s -> 2842.17s]  a look. What happened with the Elden Ring PvP? Honestly. Okay. So here's what happened with the
[2842.17s -> 2846.65s]  Elden Ring PvP. So I talked to Ludwig and I'm like, oh, hey, this, maybe we can do it with this mod.
[2847.29s -> 2854.10s]  And then didn't Twitch Rivals just kind of started doing it? Not necessarily the community
[2854.10s -> 2858.58s]  version, right? Maybe. No, they did sort of. So I was like, oh, I guess the tournament stuff
[2858.58s -> 2862.68s]  is already happening with Twitch Rivals. So I guess that's kind of what I was planning on doing
[2862.68s -> 2875.35s]  stuff like that anyways. So they're doing like, they did like a PvP thing. You can't really use
[2875.35s -> 2891.80s]  mods online. Yeah. I got to be careful too, right? Also Dark Souls 3 has a bunch of crazy shit too,
[2891.80s -> 2901.56s]  doesn't it? That I never got to. I did the FPS mod. Did you ever revisit inscription? I did
[2901.56s -> 2912.28s]  off stream. I got to the third act off stream. It's pretty crazy. I did not beat it though.
[2912.28s -> 2929.27s]  What about the Outer Wilds DLC? I don't know. Maybe. I heard the Outer Wilds DLC was
[2929.27s -> 2939.90s]  kind of hard. It was like very specific or something, right? Speaking of Ludwig,
[2939.90s -> 2945.32s]  did you guys see the Mogul Money Live? God, that was fucking hilarious.
[2948.63s -> 2956.33s]  Uh, let me tell you, Ludwig really is, he's got, he's got some chops on him.
[2958.01s -> 2968.39s]  That was so funny. He did such an unbelievable fucking job. It's really awesome to see that
[2968.39s -> 2981.83s]  whole crew doing that stuff. So yeah, he's very sociable. He's just so, he's just, he just has it.
[2983.38s -> 2989.43s]  He just has it. Does he know what I'm talking about? He's just got it. He just has it. You know
[2989.43s -> 3003.32s]  what I mean? Did you get your bidet yet? No. But then again, I never took a picture in a
[3003.32s -> 3014.76s]  Mega Milk shirt, so we're even. No, it was awesome. It was fun the whole way through.
[3019.42s -> 3025.42s]  But yeah, I'll talk to you guys in a couple days. We'll do some mod stuff and see you later. Thanks
[3025.42s -> 3031.21s]  for watching. You bet your ass I'm going to get this to exactly six hours. Exactly. On the dot.
[3034.68s -> 3039.24s]  There it is. All right. Good night. Call your mother. See you later. Take care of yourselves,
[3039.24s -> 3074.46s]  guys. Have a great night.
