[3.00s -> 13.30s]  What's up? Didn't expect me today, did you?
[13.30s -> 19.70s]  Hey. Just like I can delay streams indefinitely.
[19.70s -> 22.26s]  I can also pull them back.
[22.26s -> 27.94s]  That's exactly what we're doing.
[27.94s -> 31.25s]  We'll stream tomorrow, but I think we can go over a few things.
[31.25s -> 32.25s]  Reverse delay, yeah.
[32.25s -> 35.64s]  It happens like once a year.
[35.64s -> 37.64s]  Well, you're here for it!
[37.64s -> 44.28s]  You're here for it!
[44.28s -> 52.35s]  The one time every year that I, instead of pushing a stream out, I do it a day or two before.
[52.35s -> 60.92s]  And it's funny, because this is a mistake on my part.
[60.92s -> 67.91s]  So I come in a free stream chat, and people are just kind of like,
[67.91s -> 69.91s]  Hey, what's up, man? What are you doing here?
[69.91s -> 73.22s]  I'm just like, what do you mean? Let's get ready!
[73.22s -> 74.22s]  Probably like 3.30.
[74.22s -> 80.06s]  I thought it was Tuesday.
[80.06s -> 83.06s]  And I'm just going to go by what I think in my head.
[83.06s -> 86.06s]  So I'm not just going to get here and be ready, sitting at the desk.
[86.06s -> 88.56s]  It's like, OK, here we go.
[88.56s -> 89.56s]  It's time to stream.
[89.56s -> 91.56s]  And then, no, no, never mind.
[91.56s -> 92.56s]  I'm coming, but no, I'm here.
[92.56s -> 93.56s]  I'm ready.
[93.56s -> 94.56s]  So we're streaming today.
[94.56s -> 101.88s]  We also are going to play Such Art, which, I don't know, I saw this came out.
[101.88s -> 104.88s]  This Steel Rising, Dark Souls-like.
[104.88s -> 107.82s]  We can hear the game when you talk again.
[107.82s -> 109.82s]  What the fuck, man?
[109.82s -> 111.82s]  Why is it so hard to stream?
[111.82s -> 113.82s]  Why does it never...
[113.82s -> 118.82s]  Why do my settings get reversed every time I turn on my computer?
[118.82s -> 121.38s]  I'm being serious.
[121.38s -> 127.50s]  Why is it fixed?
[127.50s -> 132.13s]  Why do my settings reverse every time I turn my computer on?
[132.13s -> 134.75s]  What the fuck is this doing?
[134.75s -> 135.75s]  Oh, God, come on.
[135.75s -> 139.49s]  OK.
[139.49s -> 140.49s]  Anyways.
[140.49s -> 141.49s]  Yeah. All right.
[141.49s -> 142.49s]  Let's go over a few things.
[142.49s -> 149.11s]  Let's talk about the week ahead here because there's a few things we need to discuss.
[149.11s -> 150.11s]  Very important.
[150.11s -> 153.08s]  I think it's fixed.
[153.08s -> 154.32s]  Yeah.
[154.32s -> 155.32s]  All right. So here's the deal.
[155.32s -> 158.88s]  So what we're going to do this weekend.
[158.88s -> 159.88s]  Oh, my stop.
[159.88s -> 160.88s]  Hold on.
[160.88s -> 166.00s]  This weekend, we're going to do an Omega weekend.
[166.00s -> 168.71s]  OK.
[168.71s -> 169.71s]  I'm streaming today.
[169.71s -> 175.21s]  We'll go for about five to seven hours, depending on how long it takes, depending what we do.
[175.21s -> 178.96s]  But there's something that I have to do.
[178.96s -> 181.96s]  There's something that I've been kind of figuring out the last day or so.
[181.96s -> 185.52s]  It's why I didn't stream yesterday.
[185.52s -> 195.58s]  I have to get a thousand fucking baseballs signed and shipped because there's a lot of them.
[195.58s -> 206.09s]  So I have to get that going once for me.
[206.09s -> 207.09s]  That's right.
[207.09s -> 211.63s]  You should do it on stream.
[211.63s -> 213.63s]  No, I don't want to do that.
[213.63s -> 214.63s]  That's weird.
[214.63s -> 215.63s]  That's weird to me.
[215.63s -> 217.63s]  I don't like that at all.
[217.63s -> 227.20s]  I want to just sit there with a YouTube playlist up for like two to like eight hour days back
[227.20s -> 228.20s]  to back.
[228.20s -> 234.32s]  Just put on, you know what I've been really into?
[234.32s -> 235.32s]  This chemist on YouTube.
[235.32s -> 237.32s]  I have no idea what the hell he's talking about.
[237.32s -> 241.32s]  But all his videos, they're like 30 plus minute long videos.
[241.32s -> 243.56s]  And it just talks about all this chemistry.
[243.56s -> 244.56s]  Nile Red.
[244.56s -> 245.56s]  Yeah, that's the one.
[245.56s -> 249.56s]  So I just watch Nile Red and I just, here's the thing that happens when you watch a Nile
[249.56s -> 250.56s]  Red video.
[250.56s -> 255.86s]  By the time you get to the end of the video and the experiment is over, I forgot the whole
[255.86s -> 256.86s]  video.
[256.86s -> 259.10s]  I don't even know what happened.
[259.10s -> 263.22s]  They're awesome though.
[263.22s -> 266.22s]  They are the best videos just to sit there with your mouth open and just go.
[266.22s -> 267.22s]  Wow.
[267.22s -> 271.09s]  I'm learning.
[271.09s -> 280.69s]  I have no idea what I'm learning.
[280.69s -> 284.66s]  Stream that straight.
[284.66s -> 287.66s]  Wait, stream watching Nile Red videos.
[287.66s -> 288.66s]  I don't know about that.
[288.66s -> 292.66s]  I'd rather you watch Nile Red videos on Nile Red's channel.
[292.66s -> 295.60s]  I mean, we could.
[295.60s -> 297.03s]  All right.
[297.03s -> 301.03s]  But I want to do that while I'm signing baseballs.
[301.03s -> 304.81s]  Do you really want me to stream this?
[304.81s -> 305.81s]  I don't know.
[305.81s -> 306.81s]  I don't think so.
[306.81s -> 307.81s]  That's weird to me.
[307.81s -> 309.81s]  To me, that's like, I don't know.
[309.81s -> 311.81s]  That feels like an egomaniac stream.
[311.81s -> 312.81s]  I don't know why it just does.
[312.81s -> 314.81s]  That feels kind of like an egomaniac thing.
[314.81s -> 316.81s]  Oh, hey, what's up guys?
[316.81s -> 317.81s]  Signing baseballs.
[317.81s -> 318.81s]  Yeah.
[318.81s -> 319.81s]  I'm going to sign this one too.
[319.81s -> 320.81s]  Oh, give me that one.
[320.81s -> 321.81s]  Yeah.
[321.81s -> 322.81s]  I'm going to sign that one.
[322.81s -> 324.18s]  That's my name on it, by the way.
[324.18s -> 327.08s]  I don't know.
[327.08s -> 328.08s]  Maybe.
[328.08s -> 334.95s]  I will give you a hard maybe on that one, but I do.
[334.95s -> 335.95s]  I have to get that sorted.
[335.95s -> 336.95s]  I got to get shipments.
[336.95s -> 338.95s]  I got to get, it's a thousand baseballs.
[338.95s -> 339.95s]  It's a lot of material.
[339.95s -> 340.95s]  It's a ton to work with.
[340.95s -> 342.95s]  So my plan is this.
[342.95s -> 350.67s]  I'm going to stream today and then unless I decide to do an egomaniac megalomania stream,
[350.67s -> 358.94s]  the next time you see me after tonight will be for the Omega weekend on Friday, Saturday
[358.94s -> 359.94s]  and Sunday.
[359.94s -> 361.94s]  We're going to do three days in a row.
[361.94s -> 363.94s]  I know I've been kind of bouncing around a lot lately.
[363.94s -> 366.94s]  I've been, you know, it's been like three days, no stream, four days, five days, no
[366.94s -> 367.94s]  stream.
[367.94s -> 369.94s]  We're going to do an Omega weekend this weekend.
[370.94s -> 375.18s]  So get your recommendations in to the discord channel because that's going to build, it's
[375.18s -> 377.18s]  going to be a doozy of three days in a row.
[377.18s -> 383.26s]  I promise this is not going to be like a, well, this streams like four hours in a 16
[383.26s -> 384.26s]  minutes.
[384.26s -> 386.69s]  No, we're going to do three Omega streams in a row.
[386.69s -> 390.69s]  We're doing an Omega weekend and I'm going to laugh my ass off if I get like a headache
[390.69s -> 391.69s]  on Friday afternoon.
[391.69s -> 393.38s]  But that's the plan.
[393.38s -> 397.00s]  Guys, we can't do the Omega weekend.
[397.00s -> 400.00s]  I got to, I need a nap.
[400.00s -> 401.30s]  I won't.
[401.30s -> 404.46s]  Don't burn out.
[404.46s -> 406.46s]  No, I've, I've been taking a lot of time.
[406.46s -> 407.46s]  So don't worry.
[407.46s -> 408.46s]  I'll be okay.
[408.46s -> 409.46s]  It'll be fun.
[409.46s -> 410.46s]  We'll get a bunch of stuff to do.
[410.46s -> 417.93s]  You're going to call into sick for work.
[417.93s -> 421.83s]  No, I'm not going to.
[421.83s -> 423.83s]  I promise we'll do a bunch of stuff.
[423.83s -> 424.83s]  We'll play like a 10 different games.
[424.83s -> 425.83s]  We'll jump around.
[425.83s -> 426.83s]  We'll be crazy.
[426.83s -> 432.78s]  But today we're going to play this dark soul.
[432.78s -> 435.78s]  I stopped saying that because I feel like companies hate to hear that.
[435.78s -> 437.78s]  Hey guys, we're going to play this thing.
[437.78s -> 441.78s]  And the only thing that I'm going to tell you is dark souls is awesome.
[441.78s -> 442.96s]  Okay.
[442.96s -> 444.96s]  I'm sure that it's like, yeah.
[444.96s -> 447.74s]  I do.
[447.74s -> 448.74s]  Dark souls is an awesome game.
[448.74s -> 451.55s]  Let's play this one called steel rising.
[451.55s -> 452.55s]  I have no idea.
[452.55s -> 455.37s]  We're just going to, we're going to give it a try.
[455.37s -> 456.37s]  You guys ready?
[456.37s -> 457.74s]  Change the title.
[457.74s -> 464.56s]  I like that title because everybody calls everything like a souls, ask souls, light,
[464.56s -> 477.98s]  souls, like souls, ask souls, light, like I think my title is fine.
[477.98s -> 481.98s]  I should just start calling this stream a rogue light stream because it turns off and
[481.98s -> 483.98s]  we start over again with like a new game.
[483.98s -> 484.98s]  Another stream later.
[484.98s -> 486.73s]  It's kind of like a rogue.
[486.73s -> 489.73s]  Like, you know, we start over on a different, a different game.
[489.73s -> 491.80s]  Each stream.
[491.80s -> 492.80s]  All right.
[492.80s -> 494.23s]  Let me get this.
[494.23s -> 497.84s]  I think unplugged here.
[497.84s -> 498.84s]  I hope this is good.
[498.84s -> 501.36s]  All right.
[501.36s -> 503.36s]  Can you guys, you guys can't see this is way too loud for me.
[503.36s -> 505.36s]  It probably won't be too loud for you though.
[505.36s -> 507.36s]  And I can confirm.
[507.36s -> 508.73s]  Yes.
[508.73s -> 511.48s]  We've confirmed it.
[511.48s -> 514.42s]  I've confirmed it with you.
[514.42s -> 517.42s]  We are with a new camera angle.
[517.42s -> 521.69s]  I have moved it to where I want it permanently.
[521.69s -> 523.69s]  Do you understand where this is now?
[523.69s -> 524.69s]  This is a perfect gang.
[524.69s -> 526.50s]  Perfect angle.
[526.50s -> 527.50s]  Perfect lighting.
[527.50s -> 532.58s]  What do you think?
[532.58s -> 535.10s]  This is better.
[535.10s -> 536.10s]  Right?
[536.10s -> 537.10s]  You're right there.
[537.10s -> 538.10s]  You're literally right there.
[538.10s -> 539.10s]  Exactly where I wanted you.
[539.10s -> 542.65s]  It's too orange.
[542.65s -> 544.65s]  That's, that's my face.
[544.65s -> 548.58s]  All right.
[548.58s -> 551.86s]  You guys ready for this?
[551.86s -> 552.86s]  I'm ready.
[552.86s -> 553.86s]  I'm ready.
[553.86s -> 554.86s]  This is called Steel Rising.
[554.86s -> 556.10s]  Why did I laugh?
[556.10s -> 557.10s]  Oh, God damn it.
[557.10s -> 558.10s]  I can't.
[558.10s -> 559.10s]  I just, I'm why am I even live?
[559.10s -> 561.69s]  Okay.
[561.69s -> 564.69s]  And why is this funny?
[564.69s -> 565.69s]  This isn't funny.
[565.69s -> 567.86s]  Nothing that I'm doing is funny.
[567.86s -> 568.86s]  I don't understand.
[568.86s -> 569.86s]  Why am I laughing at this?
[569.86s -> 571.86s]  What the fuck is going on?
[571.86s -> 572.86s]  I'm sorry.
[572.86s -> 578.86s]  What's assist mode?
[578.86s -> 582.22s]  Okay.
[582.22s -> 583.22s]  So this makes it easier.
[583.22s -> 585.80s]  Okay.
[585.80s -> 587.80s]  Well, I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm not going to need that for now.
[587.80s -> 588.80s]  Maybe I'll need it later.
[588.80s -> 589.80s]  We'll see.
[589.80s -> 592.00s]  All right.
[592.00s -> 593.00s]  Here comes the opening cut scene.
[593.00s -> 594.00s]  Everybody's quiet.
[594.00s -> 599.78s]  Where's Otto?
[599.78s -> 600.78s]  I'll show him.
[600.78s -> 601.78s]  I told you later.
[601.78s -> 616.64s]  Checkmate.
[616.64s -> 622.82s]  You know, actually, I think I'm in no mood for games right now.
[622.82s -> 625.58s]  How much longer are we to be kept here?
[625.58s -> 628.58s]  We just simply watch as Paris burns from afar.
[628.58s -> 631.01s]  The rabble of rioting.
[631.01s -> 634.38s]  This is the price to be paid for spoiling the masses.
[634.38s -> 636.38s]  Why are they playing chess?
[636.38s -> 639.68s]  The king sent us here long before the city went up in flames.
[639.68s -> 643.24s]  He knew what was about to transpire.
[643.24s -> 645.24s]  If you're a noble, do you have to know chess?
[645.24s -> 646.24s]  What if you don't?
[646.24s -> 649.24s]  Does that annoy the other nobles?
[649.24s -> 650.24s]  True.
[650.24s -> 655.24s]  He can be misguided and somewhat short tempered at times, but he's no Nero.
[655.24s -> 658.24s]  Then why have we been given no news for so long?
[658.24s -> 662.21s]  Place en four, Gabrielle.
[662.21s -> 663.21s]  The children.
[663.21s -> 666.15s]  They'll soon be out of harm's way.
[666.15s -> 668.15s]  I am most certain of it.
[668.15s -> 671.15s]  Monsieur Clary will take good care of them.
[671.15s -> 673.15s]  For now, at least, we are safe.
[673.15s -> 674.15s]  Louder?
[674.15s -> 675.15s]  Safe.
[675.15s -> 676.15s]  Vremont?
[676.15s -> 677.33s]  Where are the Shadow Guards?
[677.33s -> 679.33s]  We are still protected.
[679.33s -> 683.33s]  The king just preferred to use a different sort of guard.
[683.33s -> 684.33s]  R1.
[684.33s -> 685.33s]  R1.
[685.33s -> 686.33s]  R1.
[686.33s -> 687.33s]  R1.
[687.33s -> 690.74s]  R1.
[690.74s -> 691.74s]  Odds?
[691.74s -> 692.74s]  Or jailers?
[692.74s -> 693.74s]  Leave this room, Gabrielle.
[693.74s -> 694.74s]  The king.
[694.74s -> 697.97s]  He has lost his mind to grief.
[697.97s -> 699.46s]  First our darling, Sophie.
[699.46s -> 700.46s]  Then our beloved son.
[700.46s -> 701.83s]  My poor sweet angel.
[701.83s -> 702.83s]  They didn't let me say goodbye.
[702.83s -> 704.07s]  What character am I?
[704.07s -> 705.07s]  I wasn't even allowed to see him.
[705.07s -> 707.02s]  Serephar.
[707.02s -> 708.02s]  Something inside me is crying out.
[708.02s -> 709.02s]  Telling me he's still of this world at times.
[709.02s -> 710.58s]  I think I hear him calling to me.
[710.58s -> 711.58s]  I'm so afraid.
[711.58s -> 712.58s]  What do you fear, my dear?
[712.58s -> 713.58s]  I'm so afraid.
[713.58s -> 714.58s]  I'm so afraid.
[714.58s -> 716.07s]  I'm so afraid.
[716.07s -> 717.07s]  I'm so afraid.
[717.07s -> 718.07s]  I'm so afraid.
[718.07s -> 719.07s]  I'm so afraid.

[991.30s -> 998.33s]  of my son how am I to leave the chateau grounds madam okay go to the riverbank
[998.33s -> 1003.17s]  at the far side of the grounds from there you can take a boat to Paris so

[1075.75s -> 1078.99s]  consumables on the quick access belt so you can use them at any time go to the
[1078.99s -> 1088.80s]  inventory to assign oil for it the belt okay this is a heel it's like an oil can
[1088.80s -> 1098.63s]  really so you like that's all right I like that so let's put it on this slot
[1098.63s -> 1109.84s]  right here okay well actually why would I have that equipped okay so it's just
[1109.84s -> 1115.10s]  repair that's kind of cool looking there's one there's one thing that I
[1115.10s -> 1122.40s]  who hold on I'm very curious if I can do this or not I saw it in them options
[1122.40s -> 1128.56s]  menu let me go let's just go to the video field of view what does that do
[1128.56s -> 1139.33s]  hundred times I'm a million times better I'm gonna say 100 fucking million times
[1139.33s -> 1147.72s]  better you know you don't understand a million times better okay hold on there
[1147.72s -> 1155.50s]  was something else I might want to do to advanced video if it's in here I'm gonna
[1155.50s -> 1164.35s]  be really happy okay that's fine that's fine that's fine ray tracing mm-hmm I
[1164.35s -> 1183.82s]  don't see it wait game subtitles camera effects no all right let's go oh you can
[1183.82s -> 1190.52s]  grab try explore is it get a full letter grade we'll find out in a second is
[1190.52s -> 1195.87s]  there sprint I don't think this is sprint it might be it's a very pretty
[1195.87s -> 1201.53s]  game that matters to anybody here all right each weapon has an attacking or
[1201.53s -> 1207.19s]  deep special move for the okay so it's like a weapon art I know it's not yeah
[1207.19s -> 1221.96s]  whatever what did that do oh it's just a block okay by the way yes it did get
[1221.96s -> 1225.80s]  rid of the screen shake I believe so that's a full letter grid all right hold
[1225.80s -> 1234.33s]  on wait you can overheat when a just runs out of endurance her gears overheat
[1234.33s -> 1238.61s]  and she can no longer perform the following actions attack jump dodge or
[1238.61s -> 1246.80s]  sprint what that's not good when you overheated you can trigger rapid
[1246.80s -> 1250.32s]  cooling which can instantly restore an amount of endurance depending on your
[1250.32s -> 1254.24s]  timing however this inflicts a certain amount of frost damage as shown in the
[1254.24s -> 1260.13s]  following gauge wait did he play this before no that's the surge is one of my
[1260.13s -> 1265.50s]  least favorite games of all time using it too soon after okay so I gotta be
[1265.50s -> 1280.95s]  careful so over let me try this oops so if I overheat okay overheated you have
[1280.95s -> 1285.98s]  to do it immediately all right that's kind of insane I'm kidding that that
[1286.02s -> 1291.88s]  game is fine I just didn't like it I know that game is it was very cool I
[1291.88s -> 1295.20s]  didn't like it whatever do I really I don't need to explain myself I didn't
[1295.20s -> 1308.52s]  like it I didn't like it so get out of here leave me alone I wonder what is
[1308.52s -> 1313.32s]  there there are no iframes wait are there iframes let's try let's test no
[1313.32s -> 1326.36s]  there isn't wait let's try it okay maybe there is I don't have any heels left
[1326.36s -> 1338.17s]  now the third you know it was the surge to that I never played the surge one I
[1338.29s -> 1342.29s]  actually enjoyed up at the first hour then I backtracked a statement that I
[1342.29s -> 1346.29s]  made in front of about 12,000 people to make sure that nobody hates me for
[1346.29s -> 1350.85s]  having a video game that I don't like or something so I backtracked and I you
[1350.85s -> 1354.53s]  know honestly like if you like what you like who cares enjoy what you enjoy
[1354.53s -> 1357.97s]  don't let some dickhead like me tell you that you can't like something because I
[1357.97s -> 1361.65s]  didn't that's stupid it's a dumb mindset and you should nobody should have it
[1361.65s -> 1377.71s]  I'm gonna die H's light weapons are able to inflict immobilization damages shown
[1377.75s -> 1381.33s]  in the immobilization gauge and the gauges build the enemy is temporarily
[1381.33s -> 1386.95s]  immobilized leaving them open to a critical hit okay so immobilization
[1386.95s -> 1401.18s]  damage did it work that for it oh okay cool ignore the fact that you're
[1401.18s -> 1407.44s]  insulting no that clip that was cycling around was a joke and you clipping it
[1407.44s -> 1412.88s]  out of context I said it and it was a it was a comedic reference it was a joke I
[1412.88s -> 1419.64s]  didn't actually mean it right afterwards I go no no I'm just kidding I need to
[1419.64s -> 1431.15s]  heal is there oh there is a sprint okay cool nice PR Andy no I genuinely look if
[1431.15s -> 1433.99s]  you like stuff who cares if I don't if we got the people don't like it do you
[1433.99s -> 1441.70s]  like it who cares enjoy it I like the venom movie you know throw
[1441.70s -> 1449.05s]  fucking eggs at me all right well that obviously can't go in there so I'm
[1449.05s -> 1473.31s]  almost dead though what happens when I die cool rusty key wait secrets what
[1473.35s -> 1482.89s]  did this game come out essence of spirit I'm livid that you don't share my
[1482.89s -> 1493.19s]  opinion you know four days ago oh shit I'm I'm right on time I'm never like
[1493.19s -> 1499.08s]  I'm never on time for this I never play a new game when it comes out I feel kind
[1499.08s -> 1517.26s]  of accomplished in some way what if I get heels are there crabs in the game
[1517.26s -> 1522.25s]  who knows we'll find out I got I'm the first boss is definitely gonna be okay
[1522.25s -> 1537.27s]  break stuff ordinary oil but wait hold on is this a heel okay it's a it's a
[1537.27s -> 1553.92s]  hot oh this is a bonfire stop saying that okay activating a vestal creates a
[1553.92s -> 1557.96s]  checkpoint where eight you know why I'm playing this because I saw the trailer
[1557.96s -> 1562.47s]  trailer for um lies of P and I was like oh I want to play like a souls game
[1562.47s -> 1581.81s]  again I knew it well whatever what's lies of P no it's I'm not saying it
[1581.81s -> 1587.60s]  wrong right it's the fucking Pinocchio game it's the Pinocchio souls like you
[1587.60s -> 1598.68s]  understand what I just said go look it up that's so weird to say okay upgrade
[1598.68s -> 1603.84s]  attributes by spending so that's essence okay so that's just like souls upgrade
[1603.84s -> 1610.76s]  equipment by spending materials and obtain equipment by spending essence so
[1610.76s -> 1617.90s]  wait you there's no you have to buy all the stuff you want to find this is a
[1617.90s -> 1641.67s]  bonfire that's cool okay upgrades module slots requires three keys weapons all
[1641.67s -> 1651.29s]  right I need 1,500 essence to upgrade this and a bronze ingot okay so all the
[1651.29s -> 1654.05s]  upgrades are literally on the same screen which is that's that's good that's
[1654.05s -> 1660.94s]  cool all right one power one agility what am I what do I want probably
[1660.94s -> 1672.05s]  agility right agility or power how do I increase damage power I don't have
[1672.13s -> 1681.88s]  souls to do this he hates it I do this feels like a YouTube somehow the YouTube
[1681.88s -> 1689.98s]  video kind of like a director's commentary why this is not a director's
[1689.98s -> 1698.94s]  commentary what's happening it's the camera angle do I do I have to buy
[1698.94s -> 1707.70s]  heels it's the camera angle this is a beautiful angle it's perfect I'm right
[1707.70s -> 1712.22s]  in frame it's got my whole head and body it's direct it's not off to the side
[1712.26s -> 1718.56s]  what this is director commentary Andy all right we're moving on we're moving on
[1718.56s -> 1732.42s]  try buy these is a stupid well maybe it was dumb but I bought four heels oh cool
[1732.42s -> 1741.02s]  any hats I'm interested I'm actually interested that seems like a pretty easy
[1741.02s -> 1746.66s]  well not easy the wrong word it seems like a pretty it's a good system to put
[1746.66s -> 1750.50s]  everything in the same place so I don't have to like go to this bonfire to find
[1750.50s -> 1754.70s]  this NPC in the woods that'll teach me how to do a spell right I know that's
[1754.70s -> 1759.38s]  cool but I do I do appreciate the like the complete package in the same spot
[1759.38s -> 1766.46s]  and I'm a huge fan of the souls games huge fan you all know that especially
[1766.46s -> 1775.28s]  Elden Ring but I do appreciate that there did I just can I sneak there's a
[1775.28s -> 1782.37s]  lot of staggering this game too seems like oh okay so I do have a heal that
[1782.37s -> 1787.58s]  regenerates it's good to know hi where's the where's the tutorial boss
[1787.58s -> 1797.68s]  let's go where are you I'm ready for it let's go this way wait did I come from

[1814.24s -> 1821.14s]  good I'm not used to paying attention to that mm-hmm I need I need deadly boss
[1821.14s -> 1825.82s]  mods installed do you know I'm saying it needs to scream at me that I'm getting
[1825.82s -> 1840.00s]  close how much is this heal to the hole right I actually need something like
[1840.00s -> 1854.02s]  DBM feels like a zoom call well whatever what the hell is that wait a minute you
[1854.02s -> 1865.34s]  need a tool to break this no stop I can't jump that the boss gets lock on to
[1865.34s -> 1870.73s]  a targeted approach slowly ooh okay that's helpful what is considered
[1871.73s -> 1879.24s]  that was pretty cool that was pretty cool I have somebody saying this it
[1879.24s -> 1893.80s]  seriously feels like a zoom call this is a fake reaction it's not you guys need
[1893.80s -> 1916.32s]  to relax I'm not superimposed on top of the video no joke I've missed it the
[1916.32s -> 1926.09s]  controller parasocial Andy's zoom call this is like a council meeting I'm so
[1926.13s -> 1939.42s]  confused I'm just gonna play oh chat raid one ooh wait you just obtained a
[1939.42s -> 1943.14s]  new module you can almost pick my nose on camera you can assign it to a module
[1943.14s -> 1951.34s]  slot of the same level from the module menu yeah what's this do increases
[1951.34s -> 1958.78s]  health this is oh this is rapid cooling I'm gonna put the health one in like I
[1958.78s -> 1967.53s]  could use it this is definitely gonna be something that drops here in no way
[1967.53s -> 1978.85s]  right this is definitely like tutorial bosses place I guess not maybe it is
[1978.85s -> 1998.24s]  right here elusory walls wasn't supposed to go on a boat this risk art
[1998.24s -> 2002.40s]  killed by the automats that replaced them that's kind of an e3 walk what I
[2002.40s -> 2005.72s]  just did but you know what I mean all right um this is kind of crazy what's
[2005.72s -> 2017.82s]  going on here captain degros governor deafrey confirms that no command was
[2017.82s -> 2023.50s]  given to replace your company with a detachment of automats I therefore urge
[2023.50s -> 2026.38s]  you until further notice to keep your distance from these machines and to
[2026.38s -> 2030.14s]  inform me of any signs of hostility do not engage unless her majesty the Queen
[2030.14s -> 2038.37s]  is in danger reinforcements are on route hurdle the back man second in
[2038.37s -> 2051.02s]  command oh whatever defeat the unstable automat to activate what I can't even
[2051.02s -> 2058.03s]  touch the bonfire until I kill the boss here oh let's go first try Andy I'm so
[2058.03s -> 2077.32s]  upset Andy all right let's go let's go first try check it out music all I have
[2077.32s -> 2100.76s]  is hot oh that's bad okay wait I'm just resetting it
[2100.76s -> 2136.43s]  shit what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing don't overheat
[2136.43s -> 2182.58s]  don't overheat no I overheat it first try yeah it was just a story boss come
[2182.58s -> 2198.76s]  on module key is this a surge like game you've just obtained a module key Aegis
[2198.76s -> 2201.90s]  has several slots for modules that augment her stats and after the
[2201.90s -> 2211.38s]  behavior of reading comprehension let me try that again Aegis has several slots
[2211.38s -> 2214.98s]  for modules that augment her stats and alter the behavior of certain mechanics
[2214.98s -> 2220.69s]  the slots of levels that allow Aegis to fit increasingly powerful modules to
[2220.69s -> 2225.21s]  unlock a slot with the module key you just obtained go to the upgrades menu at
[2225.21s -> 2230.42s]  the Vestal note you can equip modules at any given time from Aegis I'm not
[2230.42s -> 2238.63s]  comprehending this hold on let me read without talking okay so I can upgrade my
[2238.63s -> 2247.94s]  modules that was kind of fun that felt that felt pretty that felt clean and
[2247.94s -> 2262.28s]  responsive that felt pretty responsive that was fun I enjoyed that let me look
[2262.28s -> 2275.92s]  at this okay oh I get it so I can have two modules now what does this get me
[2275.92s -> 2284.76s]  though if I do three keys here should I just do the other one you so higher I
[2284.76s -> 2299.06s]  know level 2 slot um I'll just do let's just go with this so I can um have two
[2299.06s -> 2307.12s]  modules at the same time it makes sense right how many souls do I have oh shit
[2307.12s -> 2312.57s]  I can upgrade something what should I do engineering what does it do I'll give
[2312.69s -> 2322.65s]  no help menu which in multiplier loot multiplier and armor this is health I'm
[2322.65s -> 2326.77s]  assuming and during oh no it's just it's stamina and critical hit multiplier
[2326.77s -> 2337.38s]  durability is health and balance power resides but then believe it resides
[2337.38s -> 2359.54s]  it's a trick shadow on the wall I don't know how people are actors I would get
[2359.54s -> 2370.14s]  halfway through a line like that and be like Jesus you are an actor I think I'm
[2370.18s -> 2378.01s]  gonna stay with probably this or durability you're camera shy I'm not
[2378.01s -> 2380.61s]  camera shy actually I probably I'd probably be a pretty good dramatic
[2380.61s -> 2392.52s]  actor you did have a voice acting gig for that phone game I did you're right I
[2392.52s -> 2401.39s]  think I think I could be a pretty good actor if I really wanted to um I don't
[2401.39s -> 2403.99s]  know I I don't want to ruin the character so it's just tell me if
[2403.99s -> 2407.79s]  somebody helped me should I just do durability I feel like that's safe I
[2407.79s -> 2422.02s]  mean I do act on the big event streams right are you come sometimes you know
[2422.06s -> 2429.46s]  like I get into character I'm gonna do health because you know whatever that's
[2429.46s -> 2446.91s]  gonna be healthier okay cool theater kid that's fine all right so yeah now I can
[2446.91s -> 2451.54s]  put these both in so what does this do slightly reduces the internal damage
[2451.54s -> 2454.18s]  caused by rapid cooling well it's good just to have them both I'm sure I'll
[2454.18s -> 2460.21s]  find more so this system I'm assuming is probably gonna be like Hollow Knight
[2460.21s -> 2482.21s]  right it's kind of what it looks like it might be okay cool so now what what is
[2482.25s -> 2494.90s]  the alchemy capsule thing what does this do quest items no it's materials no what
[2494.90s -> 2503.84s]  is it I keep picking it up where is it it's not a quest item and it's not
[2503.84s -> 2508.68s]  materials it's not in my access belt where what is it what is it it's just
[2508.68s -> 2528.57s]  souls it is please eat a booger I keep picking it up the multi versus banner is
[2528.57s -> 2537.90s]  still there no it's not I took it off didn't I it shouldn't be there is it
[2538.10s -> 2563.17s]  hold on everybody relax it's not still there right fuck it is still there all
[2563.17s -> 2581.15s]  right we're good we're good why would there ever be a sponsor on this game
[2581.15s -> 2596.50s]  from oh I like crashed my game what happened what I do oh I like alt tab
[2596.50s -> 2609.17s]  then it did this that reset the area why is this lagging it really does not like
[2609.17s -> 2622.38s]  that I alt tabbed restart try to restart the back of the main menu and restart
[2622.50s -> 2635.91s]  alt tab again shit um I'm gonna it saves it right here right I'll just reload it
[2635.91s -> 2649.73s]  the Devon chat right now help what do I do I'll just restart it that's fine I
[2649.73s -> 2675.66s]  think I'm gonna be sick shit what happened I turned multi versus banner
[2675.66s -> 2684.58s]  and my game freaked out why is that such a stupid okay um I think I have to reset
[2684.58s -> 2699.89s]  the whole game give me one sec restart the whole game I'm interested I'm I'm
[2700.01s -> 2720.82s]  still here trust me when I would have stopped by now I would have okay let's
[2720.82s -> 2737.75s]  try it again Nvidia GeForce RTX does anybody actually turn that on I have a
[2737.75s -> 2743.43s]  3090 and I have I don't think I've ever used it I think we turned it on for one
[2743.43s -> 2749.50s]  minute in Resident Evil 8 I don't know I just to me it's just like oh hey RTX is
[2749.50s -> 2755.07s]  cool it might like fuck up the whole game though every time I've ever used it
[2755.07s -> 2773.72s]  it just slows everything down the chest over here that hurt why is this head
[2773.76s -> 2788.50s]  shaped like Stewie Griffin what I have a musket how do I use it wait hold on I
[2788.50s -> 2799.63s]  can wait a minute why didn't I do this alchemy damage flame frost and
[2799.63s -> 2806.74s]  fulmination when she uses alchemy capsules for each attack alchemical
[2806.74s -> 2810.38s]  damage fills a gauge which when full triggers an affliction which lasts and
[2810.38s -> 2829.22s]  okay ignite frost full metal alchemist is electrocution so should I have 36
[2829.22s -> 2841.54s]  bullets how many bullets do I have 34 does this refill do I have infinite no
[2841.54s -> 2856.59s]  I only have 34 okay don't waste it let's try it though what's the range on it
[2856.59s -> 2868.64s]  that's fucking way I've rented a money that's actually pretty cool all right
[2868.64s -> 2876.00s]  that's cool so you just this is ammo you just pick it up you wasted all your ammo
[2876.00s -> 2883.25s]  I didn't I needed to see how it worked before I fought anything a lantern new
[2883.25s -> 2894.06s]  zone ran it caught what does this cobblestone do okay there is a jump
[2894.10s -> 2905.56s]  attack there's a hover attack too I do like the fact that the dodge when you
[2905.56s -> 2910.54s]  dodge an attack you go around them and not just to the side I do enjoy I enjoy
[2910.54s -> 2928.80s]  it what happened to my eyebrows what do you mean ooh here flame resistance down
[2928.80s -> 2941.89s]  but everything else up let's put it on I thought this hit pog shoes okay
[2941.89s -> 2952.80s]  endurance up cool all right let's go this is blocked oh yeah shortcut I think
[2952.84s -> 2995.63s]  maybe new enemy type flame well item I thought I dodged it I think the i-frames
[2995.63s -> 3012.42s]  are small I don't think they're very big that's fun excuse me what's with the
[3012.42s -> 3025.59s]  i-frames that's cuz I alt tab that's annoying I alt tab nice hairline angle I
[3025.59s -> 3044.60s]  think it looks fine that's very generous the backstab range on that was I was a
[3044.60s -> 3057.76s]  hundred feet away you're dodging into where they attack I know that like when
[3057.76s -> 3061.00s]  you first came to this channel you probably didn't see it but it says no
[3061.00s -> 3075.36s]  back seating I got a compass oh I can set a waypoint nemesis claws excuse me
[3075.36s -> 3086.62s]  already got a new weapon all right hold on this is the scales better with agility
[3086.62s -> 3093.65s]  52 this is what about hold on wait is impact all right this is worse but
[3093.65s -> 3097.61s]  counter it's any parry that is time just right reverses the effects of the
[3097.61s -> 3106.46s]  enemy's attack and deals physical damage how are they they cool like
[3106.46s -> 3114.75s]  scarecrow hands so that's a parry I wonder how hard it is to do I try it I
[3114.75s -> 3128.20s]  try for a minute somebody else can somebody else to read that I didn't mean
[3128.20s -> 3134.65s]  to press that button there would do you're balding I'm almost 40 don't worry
[3134.65s -> 3142.50s]  and I know wish you're gonna have you wish you have this here when you're 37
[3142.50s -> 3147.32s]  you will wish that you had this fucking hairline when you're almost 40 like me
[3147.80s -> 3163.03s]  how do I get up there I can definitely get up there there's a chest up there
[3163.03s -> 3182.23s]  how do I get up here it's like an elevator or something maybe the rope I
[3182.23s -> 3199.51s]  don't think there's a grab shit shoot the gun and I re-aim the gun I don't
[3199.51s -> 3208.92s]  think I can get up there I know maybe later wait shit there's a chest up there
[3208.92s -> 3228.51s]  the other rope I don't know if I can get up there I'm just waiting to say the
[3228.51s -> 3234.45s]  solution you know being a streamer is great for a few reasons it has you know
[3234.45s -> 3239.25s]  has its pros and cons right during a broadcast but it it's great to be able
[3239.25s -> 3247.58s]  to just kind of go like this and then go oh what if I uh what if I attack the
[3247.58s -> 3251.22s]  ropes and then everyone's like oh he figured it out pog that's the best part
[3251.22s -> 3254.54s]  about being a streamer is you just don't know when I just look at chat and read
[3254.54s -> 3259.74s]  the answer and that's what we all do it everybody does it if you're a streamer
[3259.74s -> 3264.54s]  and you say you don't do that come on Gwen it's it's very subtle it's like the
[3265.10s -> 3275.60s]  where do I fucking go guys oh you know what I could try I could try the jumping
[3275.60s -> 3282.67s]  twice here all right well I'm just leaving that should not have hurt game
[3282.67s -> 3302.14s]  got a lower grade for that why one full letter grade oh this is it I just got
[3302.14s -> 3314.82s]  sucked into the game can you fast travel see the bald spot good I don't have a
[3314.86s -> 3326.43s]  bald spot all right what about this boutique wait I can just buy this stuff
[3326.43s -> 3338.25s]  all right the letter grade came back so I own the compass oh I can sell all
[3338.25s -> 3348.56s]  right there's anything can I sell this stuff you look at so I this is just the
[3348.56s -> 3353.92s]  crunchies from those other games that we won't we will not compare it to I can
[3353.92s -> 3372.80s]  level up again oh I can just use it from here that work oh okay I guess it worked
[3372.84s -> 3388.01s]  all right so agility yeah I think that makes sense right I'm weapon that scales
[3388.01s -> 3398.33s]  with agility most of my stuff is scaling with agility all right that was cool so
[3398.33s -> 3408.95s]  from here I'm trying to figure out what to go from here I gotta check for secret
[3408.95s -> 3411.63s]  areas there's probably a secret area behind this rock like that I might that
[3411.63s -> 3416.93s]  I'm doing on my own and thinking of yeah like why like I feel like I'm trying to
[3416.93s -> 3419.85s]  use my knowledge of the game and everything that there's a secret behind
[3419.85s -> 3425.79s]  the rock and it's like a rare weapon it might be I don't know it's possible I'm
[3425.79s -> 3441.42s]  pretty I have a lot of game knowledge so ordinary vile all right let's get
[3441.42s -> 3454.48s]  another boss I'm using the new weapons all right how do I get them to spin
[3454.48s -> 3464.79s]  didn't they go last time how do I get how do I do that didn't they spin am I
[3464.79s -> 3496.94s]  out of my mind they spun there it is okay it's the next one I actually like I
[3496.94s -> 3511.12s]  kind of like the cause I didn't get anything oh what all right oh I got a
[3511.12s -> 3545.91s]  key they put you in a box with a camera this time new enemy type quiet you can
[3545.91s -> 3557.64s]  tell that he's not playing the game you know I've thought of before I thought of
[3557.64s -> 3562.99s]  hiring somebody that was a true video gamer right and just have them off to
[3562.99s -> 3568.51s]  the side while I sit there and we have we have a controller setup where they're
[3568.55s -> 3573.44s]  both the controllers are player one you know I mean so we have two controllers
[3573.44s -> 3577.31s]  both are player one it's not player one and player two so they would have a
[3577.31s -> 3580.53s]  controller here and I would have the same controller and they'd be doing
[3580.53s -> 3584.49s]  insane and I can whenever I want just take over and and and just start
[3584.49s -> 3587.29s]  playing and hold up the controller and be like the fuck are you talking about
[3587.29s -> 3591.41s]  I'm literally doing it and move on my own show me moving with the controller
[3591.41s -> 3594.52s]  and everything you would absolutely fall for it because why would you ever think
[3594.52s -> 3604.86s]  it wasn't happening destiny to PvP I'll say it again my fair part of that whole
[3604.90s -> 3615.30s]  scream was Aaron Aaron I think I think you can actually hear me laugh off like
[3615.30s -> 3626.16s]  camera well not off camera but in the call Aaron Aaron it's too good it's
[3626.16s -> 3647.62s]  perfect house oh the R2 is actually really good on that I like the R2 make
[3647.62s -> 3675.96s]  on house I don't want to get to kill if you could be any dinosaur what would you
[3675.96s -> 3683.30s]  want to be pterodactyl they're the only ones who truly survived because they
[3683.30s -> 3689.16s]  turned into birds this'll we're getting weapons every five seconds here really
[3689.16s -> 3709.43s]  that's another weapon falchion and saber see affinity let me try these are cool
[3709.43s -> 3720.23s]  what's the special I was you why would you use a different weapon is there a
[3720.23s -> 3733.88s]  reason to use a different item how much more damage does this do 56 this has
[3733.88s -> 3741.04s]  yeah he's the he's a better I'll use him for a little while it overheats really
[3741.04s -> 3750.24s]  quickly I feel like the move kit is way better I think laws they're okay oh yeah
[3750.24s -> 3755.08s]  I'd be a pterodactyl because I essentially every modern dinosaur is a
[3755.08s -> 3761.80s]  pterodactyl and when my money modern dinosaur I mean birds and alligators
[3761.80s -> 3765.77s]  survive too I mean they're fucking based you know what I mean like of course
[3765.77s -> 3788.33s]  they're gonna live catalyst you have enough materials to upgrade the brett
[3788.33s -> 3793.13s]  open the upgrades menu at a vestal and use Lavo you see our catalysts to
[3793.13s -> 3797.77s]  increase the number of doses okay so this is like a s to splash all right
[3797.77s -> 3809.40s]  that's good I do everything over here did I see
[3809.40s -> 3825.72s]  everything it's this we need a tool to break this oh oh I do no I don't
[3825.72s -> 3861.99s]  got seen that boats gonna take you to Paris uh you sure how do I get back
[3861.99s -> 3868.41s]  here unstable lightning ram all right how do I get back here actually don't
[3868.41s -> 3916.10s]  remember my god get absolutely fucking decimated get fucking decimated this
[3916.10s -> 3942.32s]  guy fucking easy I win do I just have like the perfect build for that that
[3942.44s -> 3952.48s]  was not hard that guy was very very much chump that guy I was a test that's the
[3952.48s -> 3962.12s]  first time they've ever used this thing it's gonna cut to like the doctor
[3962.12s -> 3966.82s]  robotic level of mad scientist over here in some ditch that's hiding with a
[3966.82s -> 3970.70s]  remote control being like blasted I can't believe my creation was killed so
[3970.70s -> 3982.14s]  easily that's how that's that kind of the level of how bad that was hey I'll
[3982.14s -> 3986.95s]  take it I'm happy the first guy was actually pretty hard the first guy was
[3986.95s -> 3989.93s]  pretty challenging although I did kind of cheese that so is that really fair
[3989.93s -> 3995.68s]  for me to say that this boat will take me to Paris make sure I can't do
[3995.68s -> 4000.82s]  anything else I cheese the absolute hell what difficulty is it it's the whatever
[4000.82s -> 4013.54s]  the regular one I cheese that app 100% you're going to meet your compact
[4013.54s -> 4045.44s]  ancestor on France I'm not French on France wait what is this the do it
[4045.44s -> 4057.14s]  territory one of the mods is trying to gaslight me but though pterosaurs lived
[4057.14s -> 4061.86s]  among dinosaurs and certainly looked like dinosaurs to the untrained eye the
[4061.86s -> 4072.71s]  two groups are not the same okay pterodactyls weren't dinosaurs they were
[4072.71s -> 4085.19s]  another species hold on wait it was Paris across the lake that's not where I
[4085.19s -> 4091.28s]  came from right is that where I came from that doesn't make any sense they
[4091.28s -> 4098.22s]  wouldn't know right I had to go down a hole this uh-huh no I was gonna say you
[4098.22s -> 4100.86s]  could have you could have shot my head of a cannon over here in the beginning
[4100.86s -> 4127.06s]  of the game I gotta find a vest a vest you'll not a bonfire I don't lose all
[4127.06s -> 4143.42s]  those souls right okay what all right I think you went down the river Cian that
[4143.42s -> 4149.73s]  goes right through the middle of Paris what where am I I don't even know never
[4149.73s -> 4174.17s]  mind he is playing yeah I climb this oh my god you ruined my moment I actually
[4174.17s -> 4181.58s]  I'm kind of scared because I where's the I need a safe point this one there but
[4181.58s -> 4206.00s]  chest no frost grenade cool I like this area cool I can probably level up a
[4206.00s -> 4224.86s]  couple of times oh no you can't go through the gate right how come you can
[4224.86s -> 4231.58s]  go through the gate but I can't all right well there's the bonfire yes
[4231.58s -> 4244.10s]  whatever it is best still can you do something funny my mom is watching no
[4244.10s -> 4258.11s]  go do your homework about I think it's just agility and durability if I can do
[4258.11s -> 4282.29s]  both I can crush some crunchies okay is that enough other durability he's 24
[4282.29s -> 4304.50s]  I'm gonna hold on to the key you don't know that does the price go up every
[4304.50s -> 4308.26s]  time or down every time wait is that how many oh I have 218 of these why am I
[4308.26s -> 4324.68s]  buying them okay let's uh stretch out a little a little bit of balm what's the
[4324.68s -> 4332.45s]  best salad recipe to learn for a recent grad depends on what you like red
[4332.45s -> 4341.53s]  cabbage with Caesar salad I usually don't like Caesar salad to me is just
[4341.53s -> 4345.99s]  is not is not a food do I feel is it weird for me to say that I don't feel I
[4345.99s -> 4349.99s]  feel like Caesar salad is not a rough food it's not a real food it's like
[4349.99s -> 4355.19s]  shredded lettuce croutons and like fucking dressing I genuinely don't find
[4355.19s -> 4373.04s]  to be a real food what about chicken well hold on you didn't say chicken
[4373.04s -> 4379.28s]  Caesar salad we're talking about just Caesar salad chicken Caesar salad
[4379.28s -> 4405.34s]  changes everything is this free spot I didn't even ask this question does this
[4405.34s -> 4426.90s]  respawn enemies I don't think it does okay it does okay what was I saying yeah
[4426.90s -> 4433.10s]  okay so I Caesar salad to me is well the new listen the nutritional content of
[4433.10s -> 4439.90s]  just regular lettuce is really not that high the nutritional content of just
[4439.90s -> 4444.26s]  chunks of bread just croutons is really not that high so if you're eating a
[4444.26s -> 4449.06s]  Caesar salad lunch you're not really getting very much it's just kind of
[4449.06s -> 4456.14s]  nothing a little side of a Caesar salad that's fine but if it's like oh yeah
[4456.14s -> 4458.42s]  I'll take a Caesar salad you're not really getting a whole lot of nutritional
[4458.42s -> 4464.14s]  value is not but it tastes good you name me a bunch of other things that tastes
[4464.18s -> 4476.60s]  good too that much better for you can I get up there lettuce has vitamins okay
[4476.60s -> 4485.85s]  lettuce has the vitamins I don't think lettuce has that many vitamins it
[4485.85s -> 4493.35s]  depends what kind of lettuce you're talking about spinach yeah you didn't
[4493.35s -> 4500.09s]  say spinach was you said lettuce I love spinach spinach is one of my favorite
[4500.09s -> 4505.17s]  foods spinach is one of the best things ever what am I good how do I get out of
[4505.17s -> 4550.08s]  here how do I get out of here oh okay water flask yeah that's cool you know I
[4550.08s -> 4557.82s]  think the problem with salads are or is the problem with a salad for me is when
[4557.82s -> 4563.06s]  I'm hungry I don't it's not like oh I'm hungry I can't wait to eat salad I wish
[4563.06s -> 4568.05s]  salad was more substantial and I know that you can make salad more substantial
[4568.05s -> 4571.73s]  right but eventually you get to a point where there's so much shit in the salad
[4571.73s -> 4595.57s]  that it's kind of just like I'm a mess oh god come on what the oh my goodness
[4595.57s -> 4604.30s]  that was a long cool down romaine is all right right remains good salad toppers
[4604.30s -> 4620.79s]  all right well let me check this way that's a Boston take maybe it is because
[4620.79s -> 4625.07s]  on the East Coast and this is completely different on than it is here in Vegas
[4625.07s -> 4632.62s]  and on the West Coast I've found I was spoiled rotten with some of the on the
[4632.62s -> 4636.66s]  East Coast just has some of the best pizza the best sub shops the best
[4636.66s -> 4641.10s]  fucking sandwich places oh you want it you want like a big sub you're the best
[4641.10s -> 4649.04s]  in the world is on the East Coast Boston New York Philadelphia I mean I was
[4649.04s -> 4653.96s]  spoiled rotten so eating like a big steak and cheese with my grilled onions
[4653.96s -> 4669.01s]  on it I don't want to eat the salad with pine nuts like what happened I'm so
[4669.05s -> 4676.07s]  jealous I miss it all the time I really do going back to the East Coast going
[4676.07s -> 4683.98s]  back to Boston getting pizza from there just hits so different so different a
[4683.98s -> 4696.86s]  good nice thin crust just right out of the oven oh my god it's not the same not
[4696.86s -> 4702.75s]  here not at all there's decent pizza places around here but I wouldn't call
[4702.75s -> 4713.07s]  them good hold on I gotta be quiet this is kind of a hard pull I won't do it
[4713.11s -> 4731.50s]  all right we're good the East Coast is terrible for stargazing I'd rather a
[4731.50s -> 4737.04s]  steak and cheese sub than stargazing okay on my tier list of location based
[4737.04s -> 4743.92s]  things stargazing is way below like a Philly cheese steak it just it just is
[4743.92s -> 4762.75s]  but I love Vegas I love it out here so while I lose a lot of my favorite local
[4762.75s -> 4768.39s]  awesome sub shops and pizza places I gained Las Vegas which is man there's a
[4768.39s -> 4777.70s]  whole lot more to do there's a whole lot more going on out here I gotta put some
[4777.70s -> 4786.66s]  stuff in my bar here all right hold on so I go back and this game is fun I
[4786.66s -> 4794.82s]  actually like this game I have to be pessimistic Andy every time I open a

[5031.70s -> 5038.00s]  like this you know what I'm talking about it's where they go like this they
[5038.00s -> 5045.52s]  go like some people must have to know what I'm talking about they put their
[5045.52s -> 5058.96s]  arms up and it's like boing boing boing boing boomer on tick-tock I don't use
[5058.96s -> 5061.64s]  tick-tock I'm just I was trying to relate that to some of you guys know
[5061.64s -> 5070.95s]  I'm saying all right there's a there's a fight here so quiet now it was midair
[5070.95s -> 5085.38s]  through the frost is so unbelievable in this game it's like a free hit all right
[5085.38s -> 5097.55s]  this guy's kind of hard is this a class thing because this is the best class for
[5097.55s -> 5122.23s]  sure the only people on tick-tock are influencers I you I don't even you might
[5122.23s -> 5140.40s]  need to walk that one back that's not true I feel like I'm close to a boss
[5140.40s -> 5161.19s]  all right this is kind of scary it's kind of fucked up I'm gonna pick this
[5161.19s -> 5173.63s]  up and something's gonna drop right ah where is it there's something about that
[5173.63s -> 5184.45s]  metal boom boom boom boom talk more about lettuce um what do you want me to say
[5184.45s -> 5197.12s]  shit all right I'm gonna I'm gonna just gun this person new area oh wait a
[5197.12s -> 5215.10s]  minute this is a shortcut or something it's not a shortcut there's just one
[5215.10s -> 5227.82s]  there's just one I'll take it flame resistance violet oh there's
[5227.82s -> 5234.30s]  definitely gonna be a flame enemy lettuce okay so there's lettuce is um I
[5234.30s -> 5243.28s]  love the taste of lettuce and mayo and like like lettuce chicken and mayo
[5243.28s -> 5250.71s]  together like that shredded lettuce all right I need to play really cautiously
[5250.71s -> 5281.86s]  here no yeah I'm playing like an absolute coward right now there's no
[5281.86s -> 5294.87s]  way I'm gonna not guy to do anything there's no diminishing returns on frost
[5294.91s -> 5327.07s]  then why I'm gonna just the combo every time oh my god okay I need health fire
[5327.07s -> 5331.64s]  chain I can upgrade the weapons can I what should I do which one should I
[5331.64s -> 5343.68s]  upgrade I'm running out of ammo shit all right hold on wait wait wait I'm not
[5343.68s -> 5353.73s]  going over there yet upgrade the gun the gun is alchemy though hold on great to
[5353.73s -> 5386.39s]  stable charging my god I was actually puked okay this is just a pole no all
[5386.39s -> 5391.92s]  right flame grenade take that off all right explosive grenade what about the
[5391.92s -> 5401.81s]  compass maybe I'll use it and then frost grenade and take this off so what does
[5401.81s -> 5414.62s]  the compass do we use it what does it do oh wow oh I can I can just bet all
[5414.62s -> 5424.19s]  right that's cool I get to have a quest marker I'll take it that's fine with me
[5424.19s -> 5453.94s]  oh thank God I need that right now is it on hard I could I have even so I
[5453.94s -> 5459.85s]  don't think I could even selected hard I don't think that was an option I just
[5459.85s -> 5489.17s]  played on there whatever the regular mode is I'm gonna sneeze yes shortcut
[5489.17s -> 5494.53s]  there's no pop there's no pause oh there is a positive nevermind it's not like
[5494.53s -> 5512.03s]  the Voldemort game that we can't say there we go should I do I don't know I
[5512.03s -> 5514.75s]  feel like the gun is amazing it's actually incredible and I should have
[5514.75s -> 5526.27s]  started with it show Otto I will just not yet no I'm playing this game I don't
[5526.27s -> 5532.62s]  think it's power ever engineering engineering is what like a luck stat in
[5532.62s -> 5542.82s]  this game how come you're changing your camera angles every stream do you have
[5542.82s -> 5564.39s]  ass acne you've never seen a camera from back there no you when that's never
[5564.39s -> 5572.06s]  happened maybe a point in there yeah I feel like it's probably a good idea this
[5572.06s -> 5583.46s]  is like stamina right yeah I haven't have to do it again all right so how
[5583.46s -> 5588.02s]  does this scale wait a second hold on that's a that's a weapon I thought that
[5588.02s -> 5594.21s]  was a module so I say whatever you want about this game go ahead and say it but
[5594.21s -> 5607.77s]  this is the fifth weapon in an hour in ten minutes what is this all right it's
[5607.77s -> 5622.66s]  kind of funky cool and now it's on fire oh yeah that's cool not gonna be using
[5622.66s -> 5642.28s]  it though 60 wait 61 plus 25 this is better I guess I mean what do I want to
[5642.28s -> 5652.68s]  upgrade this is the highest scaling I'll try it for a few minutes why not wait
[5652.68s -> 5660.77s]  can I come on oh my goodness you don't doesn't have to be a side arm that's not
[5660.77s -> 5666.16s]  even a side arm this is an actual weapon all right cool well I'll try it for a
[5666.16s -> 5678.26s]  little while are you the booger guy oh yeah you probably found me from that
[5678.26s -> 5683.67s]  clip of me like I thought the stream was off then the camera was still on it was
[5683.67s -> 5687.95s]  pretty dark but I said you know you can still see and I just I just ate a shit
[5687.95s -> 5689.99s]  little bit too I was I was eating boogers in the chair for like ten
[5689.99s -> 5692.63s]  straight minutes I know everyone's seen the clip by now but whatever yeah that's
[5692.63s -> 5696.55s]  fine I'm glad you found the stream I mean without that viral clip I wouldn't
[5696.55s -> 5706.70s]  have you know you wouldn't have been here you wouldn't have found it all
[5706.70s -> 5713.64s]  right so this is just the three doses oh all right I'll come back and figure this
[5713.68s -> 5721.71s]  out later these grenades work pretty well yeah I'm gonna buy many of these I
[5721.71s -> 5736.46s]  can look at I can upgrade something so what can I upgrade how come there's still
[5736.46s -> 5744.41s]  a you can upgrade thing oh cuz I have keys I'm gonna hold on to him dog I'm
[5744.41s -> 5759.64s]  not I want to use him all right let's go so that I opened up the shortcut which
[5759.64s -> 5786.00s]  is here now I'm not wearing a hairnet as items cool god damn it everything has
[5786.00s -> 5797.07s]  been cool so far I'm going the wrong way I'm definitely going the wrong way
[5797.07s -> 5815.46s]  there it is this is the right way right yeah oh shit oh shit oh shit am I going
[5815.46s -> 5824.94s]  wrong am I going the wrong way wait is that the wrong way didn't I open up a
[5824.94s -> 5834.10s]  shortcut that led right here wait I'm confused oh thanks God I've got the
[5834.10s -> 5852.97s]  compass otherwise this would have been a lot harder there it is excellent I am
[5853.41s -> 5864.96s]  yes okay we got it I'm so glad that exists hey you know what they could have
[5864.96s -> 5869.72s]  done which would have been funny if to turn the compass on it takes souls it's
[5869.72s -> 5874.84s]  like 500 souls to turn the compass on so that would be funny and it scales as you
[5874.84s -> 5883.63s]  level would have been kind of fun that would have been kind of funny all right
[5883.63s -> 5897.78s]  there we go this is what I'm doing don't worry about that this is it all
[5897.78s -> 5917.85s]  right let's freaking go the hell was that that's fire looks crazy that
[5917.85s -> 5962.14s]  actually looks awesome shit oh now you're on fire we haven't been on fire
[5962.14s -> 5977.39s]  this whole time that took a long time to get you there get up there get up go go
[5977.39s -> 6007.45s]  go go go go no ammo be drunk be talking about I could be using a yo-yo cuz it's
[6007.45s -> 6016.39s]  kind of fun all right the weapons cool but it's a little too slow for me that's
[6016.39s -> 6045.12s]  a little too much to lead up very cool though essence of a valiant spirit okay
[6045.12s -> 6077.97s]  I gotta go this way wait I already came this way did I look can I open that
[6077.97s -> 6096.52s]  what's all those wait where am I compass thank you this up there's no way I
[6096.52s -> 6101.50s]  ever would have figured that out that like you kidding me I would never would
[6101.50s -> 6113.26s]  have jumped up here for no reason why is the camera get worse every stream this
[6113.26s -> 6119.26s]  camera is in a perfect angle it's in a perfect position this is the most in
[6119.26s -> 6124.86s]  frame I've ever been in my whole life on stream it's the most in frame this is
[6124.86s -> 6132.46s]  the most you've seen me here and I just maybe drink a potion time that person
[6132.46s -> 6155.22s]  out for an hour at least an hour endurance and armor yep absolute in
[6155.22s -> 6162.45s]  frame this is the most absolutely in frame I've ever been pretty the compass
[6162.45s -> 6189.62s]  a like a boss is incoming could be wrong I wonder how much I'm going to
[6189.62s -> 6207.87s]  absolutely style on this boss coming up find out I've got a ton where are these
[6207.87s -> 6215.87s]  petrification grenades like ten of these this is this immobilizes enemies all
[6215.87s -> 6234.75s]  right well let's go look directly into the camera for a little while no why am
[6234.75s -> 6259.64s]  I hearing this music I was just throwing rocks oh no can we talk but there's like
[6259.68s -> 6277.62s]  what is that how do I talk through the window and I get in I don't think I can
[6277.62s -> 6307.06s]  even talk to this person oh no thank you how all right shoot this guy down I
[6307.06s -> 6340.56s]  don't know I don't read this fighting people okay now I can read the note on
[6340.56s -> 6348.36s]  the ground I don't even why do I want I don't want to read the note what though
[6348.36s -> 6372.32s]  oh my god that's really what that was okay that shouldn't hurt by the way I'm
[6372.32s -> 6381.01s]  made out of like stainless steel or something why would that hurt I'm a
[6381.01s -> 6385.89s]  robot I made out of metal and shit why would a falling five feet off why would
[6385.89s -> 6408.91s]  that hurt me it's like driving through a pothole all right that's fair wait
[6408.91s -> 6439.42s]  what's over here even at max resolution your cameras off wow that does a lot of
[6439.42s -> 6451.84s]  damage they quit work dogs he's ranging he's raging why'd I say
[6451.84s -> 6468.97s]  ranging okay okay oh what is it whoo nice okay cool so wait hold on this
[6468.97s -> 6486.00s]  game's cute this is cute game oh all right they still streaming tomorrow I am
[6486.00s -> 6491.37s]  not I'm well by the way those that are trickling in let's go over it again so
[6491.37s -> 6496.81s]  oh I have to I've been trying to figure out I'm gonna do this I have to sign and
[6496.81s -> 6509.68s]  ship a thousand baseballs and it's time to do that so what we're doing is we're
[6509.68s -> 6518.74s]  doing an Omega weekend this weekend they're the plan was I was gonna do
[6518.74s -> 6522.30s]  maybe tomorrow and Wednesday but I said you know what no I'm gonna get this done
[6522.30s -> 6529.01s]  I want to get it done I want to actually put real time into it and care so I'm
[6529.01s -> 6533.97s]  gonna spend the next couple days signing boxing and shipping a thousand
[6533.97s -> 6541.01s]  baseballs so Friday Saturday Sunday we're gonna do an Omega weekend three
[6541.01s -> 6554.02s]  days in a row stream the signing that's it's possible but I'm not gonna
[6554.02s -> 6557.06s]  guarantee that I'm gonna say that probably won't happen all right do I have
[6557.06s -> 6568.75s]  enough stream the signing stream the signing I yeah I don't know I don't it
[6568.75s -> 6580.57s]  feels odd to me I don't want to do that I have a lot of these okay I I have a
[6580.57s -> 6589.97s]  criticism if the devs are watching I I like it when it goes like this shows the
[6589.97s -> 6596.36s]  amount that I added like when it I want it to be like you know what I mean
[6596.36s -> 6605.43s]  because when I use one of these in the menu it's just kind of like yeah I used
[6605.43s -> 6612.38s]  it it doesn't like show that like on the bottom or something it says like the
[6612.38s -> 6617.16s]  amount that's on it but I don't have a real-time calculation they're not
[6617.16s -> 6620.86s]  watching you told me they were you literally said that like an hour ago
[6620.86s -> 6635.65s]  all right it's time to choose a weapon this would be 60 this would be it's not
[6635.65s -> 6643.72s]  this one it's probably this or what would that be 48 is it the claws or is
[6643.72s -> 6653.49s]  it the the falchion the claws are gonna have the best scaling but do I like them
[6653.49s -> 6663.14s]  better I'll show on or or claws I this move set was better but it scales worse
[6663.14s -> 6678.23s]  not that it matters at this early should be the falchion all right get a poll
[6678.23s -> 6682.81s]  going because I actually don't know and I'm seeing a lot of both one for
[6682.81s -> 6690.36s]  falchion and saber two for claws and we're gonna be upgrading that buddy the
[6690.36s -> 6693.44s]  long face because I'm a goofy motherfucker they die do I have to
[6693.44s -> 6712.87s]  answer that one or two one is falchion and saber and two is nemesis claws one
[6712.87s -> 6725.50s]  two I'm afraid to alt tab so I can't click on it so hopefully you guys can I
[6725.50s -> 6738.17s]  get an update of what the percentage is claws have a parry yeah but all right so
[6738.17s -> 6741.77s]  this has a parry but this has the cool blade tornado that has a different
[6741.77s -> 6750.63s]  damage scale it's interesting falchion is winning by a lot okay oh I didn't we
[6750.63s -> 6758.29s]  didn't even look at this yeah all right so there's no way it's coming back
[6758.29s -> 6762.69s]  congratulations I'll share and saber enjoyers that's what we're gonna
[6762.69s -> 6782.68s]  upgrade and I'm gonna do it right now there we go all right so that I'm gonna
[6782.68s -> 6787.80s]  be doing a lot more damage I think looks good very cool other moves that on this
[6787.80s -> 6801.24s]  is good as well cool all right I'm ready can you play so much or scare
[6801.24s -> 6808.82s]  Saturdays this October we'll do a bunch of horror stuff I'll do a lot of horror
[6808.86s -> 6822.12s]  stuff this month coming up we'll get a list so good it takes almost the whole
[6822.12s -> 6829.23s]  stamina bar but it kills almost anything in one hit will you do Halloween movie
[6829.23s -> 6834.92s]  night if I can find some more public domain horror movies yeah they have to
[6834.92s -> 6857.56s]  be public domain all right let's get it where we going here yeah oh that came
[6857.56s -> 6891.59s]  out far that move is so good there's a combo with the R2 pretty good you know I
[6891.59s -> 6896.43s]  really do wonder I genuinely probably should look into this I wonder just how
[6896.43s -> 6900.56s]  much money it would cost what the cost effectiveness kind of ratio there would
[6900.56s -> 6904.68s]  be to like how much this cost or how fun we could have on stream for me to just
[6904.68s -> 6910.61s]  buy the licensing streaming rights to be able to show a movie on stream for a
[6910.61s -> 6916.91s]  night it can't be that expensive some of these old movies right some of these
[6916.91s -> 6923.81s]  old old fucking movies there's no way that would be you know how much am I
[6923.81s -> 6932.34s]  willing to pay for that a lot more than I think a lot of you guys think actually
[6932.34s -> 6935.66s]  go through the rights holders and be like hey can I scream this movie without
[6935.66s -> 6952.82s]  you having a problem with it what the fuck you can do that I wonder how far
[6952.82s -> 6959.30s]  that could go right I wonder how much money would it take to stream like
[6959.30s -> 6963.98s]  gremlins to somebody was saying I wonder what that would cost it's I mean it's
[6963.98s -> 6970.09s]  Warner right it's expensive but not that bad I know people that own a retro shit
[6970.09s -> 6975.35s]  wait hold on you do wait wait wait wait it I want to all tab but with mods mods
[6975.35s -> 6981.93s]  find that person that just said that that they know how that works and and I
[6981.93s -> 6989.38s]  would like to question them and you know I mean I want to like talk to them can
[6989.38s -> 6997.02s]  we like ask that person some stuff and I want to interrogate that person find
[6997.02s -> 7001.55s]  that person because we're gonna interrogate what do you know about
[7001.55s -> 7008.71s]  getting the rights to gremlins to what do you know I know people that own a
[7008.71s -> 7011.71s]  retro cinema and they do it all the time all right well let's maybe we could
[7011.71s -> 7017.86s]  find out some info because I am willing I'm not kidding around I I wish I was
[7017.86s -> 7020.50s]  joking when I say this but I'm willing to put thousands and thousands of
[7020.50s -> 7024.82s]  dollars and to be to be able to do that I am willing to put up money to be able
[7024.82s -> 7029.40s]  to stream some old dumb horror movie that could get the stream shut down
[7029.40s -> 7038.30s]  right because they have to be a license pretty much per movie wouldn't that be
[7038.30s -> 7044.46s]  fun should we'd be like licensed movie Andy let's do it let's do it I'm gonna
[7044.46s -> 7047.22s]  look into it I'm gonna get on the phone with community Jake literally tonight
[7047.22s -> 7052.10s]  let's see if it's possible well I will talk to the person that has experience
[7052.10s -> 7057.20s]  doing it because that would be really fun oh no what happens if it's too fun
[7057.20s -> 7066.08s]  and that's like all I want to do oh well whatever private domain movie night
[7066.08s -> 7089.58s]  that's right oh you were over here that doesn't stagger too dark over here I
[7089.58s -> 7102.60s]  can't see yeah let's let's buy the licensing rights to a bunch of old horror
[7102.60s -> 7110.82s]  movies and maybe who cares movies that aren't horrible I mean I wonder how
[7110.82s -> 7116.63s]  much does it cost to stream a licensing deal with like three men and a baby that
[7116.63s -> 7126.10s]  possible I mean these movies are old they're really old and they're probably
[7126.10s -> 7144.79s]  on streaming services I don't know what about an Amazon watch party see I don't
[7144.79s -> 7150.99s]  want to do that because that I that kind of like sucks from my understanding the
[7150.99s -> 7154.59s]  way that that works is only certain people from certain regions can do it
[7155.15s -> 7160.34s]  there's a very limited amount of shows to watch and it's not me streaming it
[7160.34s -> 7164.58s]  right doesn't it like take over the stream and it's not like me hanging out
[7164.58s -> 7169.18s]  with like a cam on right it's pretty limited to what you can do with it I
[7169.18s -> 7176.61s]  would rather have people be able to hang out and enjoy it they never work either
[7176.61s -> 7183.70s]  if it's you and a mini player no no no no I would I would want to buy one night
[7183.70s -> 7187.38s]  streaming rights to some of these movies and just do it the way that we would
[7187.38s -> 7195.23s]  want to do it the vaude would have to be destroyed too yeah I just wouldn't
[7195.23s -> 7197.99s]  turn the vaude on that would be a thing that people knew was gonna happen right
[7197.99s -> 7204.39s]  it's hey we're do we're streaming this movie it cost me like $14,000 to buy the
[7204.39s -> 7207.95s]  rights to stream this movie for a night you're gonna want to be there alive
[7207.95s -> 7212.64s]  because it's not gonna be I'm not gonna have a vaude or whatever like insane
[7212.64s -> 7222.74s]  amount of money it costs I'm afraid of this they're a shortcut or something I'm
[7222.74s -> 7239.38s]  afraid of going through there oh hello wait hold on just release the audio
[7239.38s -> 7246.75s]  recording of your voice that could do that probably get it sponsored I don't
[7246.75s -> 7255.54s]  think I would want to do that because I would want us to be able to just say and
[7255.54s -> 7258.90s]  have just have fun and not worry about like oh you know the rights holder is
[7258.90s -> 7264.86s]  here can't talk about how like shitty that scene was right it's just I'm buying
[7264.86s -> 7270.79s]  the rights to stream this that's it unless it was made very clear that the
[7270.79s -> 7273.87s]  rights holder that they just didn't care at all they're like you'd literally say
[7273.87s -> 7285.49s]  whatever you want you can do whatever you want please do it with Morbius I do
[7285.49s -> 7289.37s]  not I do not have the capital to be able to buy the rights to stream Morbius
[7289.37s -> 7293.73s]  you're talking about potentially I wanted to take a wild guess it would
[7293.73s -> 7298.85s]  probably cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to stream Morbius legally to this
[7298.85s -> 7305.52s]  channel can you imagine if I spent like five hundred and like thirty thousand
[7305.52s -> 7311.59s]  dollars just just liquidate everything I own to be able to stream Morbius for one
[7311.59s -> 7315.22s]  night I mean that would be kind of funny then that would probably get a lot of
[7315.22s -> 7322.98s]  press streamer liquidates entire net worth to stream Morbius for one night
[7322.98s -> 7328.42s]  just like two thousand one hundred and twenty five people you know what I mean
[7328.42s -> 7331.26s]  it would be it would be like that it would be like oh yeah dude Morbius let's
[7331.26s -> 7342.23s]  go like two thousand one hundred and and like ten people would show up all
[7342.23s -> 7360.37s]  right where's the bonfire that would be so funny though I think to make that
[7360.37s -> 7365.01s]  even a reality I'm trying to think of the legal way logistically you would
[7365.01s -> 7369.49s]  have to do that I would need to make a business I would have to make a new LLC
[7369.49s -> 7373.81s]  or something right and I'm a movie theater it's a oh yes I'm a movie
[7373.81s -> 7378.91s]  theater and I'm streaming movies and then buy the rights for my movie theater
[7378.91s -> 7386.27s]  to stream to like thirty or forty thousand people with my movie see how
[7386.27s -> 7402.53s]  would this even work all right I'm getting lost here where's the I'm talking
[7402.53s -> 7413.60s]  about being okay wait wait where am I wait there's a bonfire here somewhere see
[7413.60s -> 7417.12s]  if you should contact Warner and see if they would want to do a gremlins movie
[7417.12s -> 7423.73s]  night I don't I I don't think okay here we go I don't think that no that's not
[7423.73s -> 7427.49s]  gonna happen that would not happen yeah I mean we would there would be a we
[7427.49s -> 7434.34s]  would do it and it'd be fun but there's no way it's not possible I'm not I I am a
[7434.34s -> 7444.41s]  I am a small fry in the grand scheme of all media that's not gonna happen I'm a
[7444.41s -> 7448.13s]  small fry in the grand scheme of things I'm not I cannot get the rights to
[7448.13s -> 7450.69s]  gremlins you know what I mean it's not happening
[7450.69s -> 7465.05s]  don't anymore crunchies I do have a crunchy so you mean I just used it I
[7465.09s -> 7479.26s]  want like a and count on the bottom right I see I'm thinking health or just
[7479.26s -> 7488.20s]  keep going with his agility I do another weapon no what do I do
[7488.20s -> 7506.61s]  see health can you run out of the compass all right I feel like there's
[7506.61s -> 7517.54s]  something going on here yeah I I'm trying to think of how much some of
[7517.54s -> 7524.30s]  these old horror movies that no one real I 10 grand 20 grand would be let's be
[7524.30s -> 7527.98s]  realistic how much do you think that would really be then if I was gonna buy
[7527.98s -> 7533.48s]  the rights to scream for one night like five four or five movies that would be
[7533.48s -> 7549.67s]  every a lot I'll be 4k 5k maybe not more than a few thousand I wonder what the
[7549.67s -> 7564.16s]  Agra range on this out of here all right let's get this is definitely boss I have
[7564.16s -> 7576.68s]  three of these keys I wonder if I should use them yeah cuz something very we talk
[7576.72s -> 7581.12s]  about this sometimes something very important to know is if a movie is free
[7581.12s -> 7586.24s]  to watch it is not free to stream it to broadcast I don't I don't have
[7586.24s -> 7597.07s]  broadcasting rights to some of these properties right there's a huge
[7597.07s -> 7611.24s]  difference between this is free to watch and this is free to broadcast be cool
[7611.24s -> 7617.65s]  though I'll look into it maybe if you've used one of the platforms that you
[7617.65s -> 7623.36s]  stream the ads they'll they won't care no I would need because the way that it
[7623.36s -> 7628.48s]  works right on I think on twitch is somebody can just shut the stream down
[7628.48s -> 7632.16s]  they can just claim the stream they can be like nope I don't think so and just
[7632.16s -> 7637.21s]  turn it off so it would have to be expressed written permission from the
[7637.21s -> 7641.37s]  rights holder so no one can just go excuse me turn this off it'd be like no
[7641.37s -> 7645.61s]  no no that I've already been in contact with which and the rights holder this is
[7645.61s -> 7657.95s]  the screen staying on I'll look into it I really will I don't care scream it
[7657.99s -> 7678.34s]  loser we're trying to figure out how risky stupid don't fall off the edge
[7678.34s -> 7713.43s]  they can hit each other shit was dumb what the fuck has happened okay we're
[7713.43s -> 7719.34s]  good I didn't use any heels streaming but make everything look like a normal
[7719.34s -> 7722.82s]  stream have a cover of you gaming a random video game and everything then
[7722.82s -> 7725.50s]  just play movies illegally without anyone noticing how does that doesn't
[7725.50s -> 7734.19s]  make any sense what's your your thought process on that stream with a game but
[7734.19s -> 7739.78s]  then have the movie like what that we switch to so when people say that hey
[7739.78s -> 7744.80s]  this twitch staff in chat I hit a button and it goes to me playing steel rising
[7744.80s -> 7753.05s]  like we got like mom caught us I mean that would be funny but I would get
[7753.05s -> 7762.25s]  banned I don't know how long you can request a stream it for free oh yeah
[7762.25s -> 7768.93s]  absolutely you a lot of these talks would be hey can I do this not hey can I
[7768.93s -> 7774.49s]  give you $25,000 to stream the gremlins to no it would be like hey can we work
[7774.49s -> 7784.30s]  something out that will start there you start at hey can I do this and then it
[7784.30s -> 7787.44s]  goes through well I don't think so not unless you decide to pay for the rights
[7787.44s -> 7796.92s]  that's when you go negotiator in there me I'll bring that price down how much
[7796.92s -> 7806.32s]  was it I was 25 grand best I can do is 16 thousand and then they never they
[7806.36s -> 7838.32s]  never answer the phone again does this open ah that's a boss for sure I tried
[7838.32s -> 7857.86s]  to dodge I ran a stamina these guys are annoying as you're not over there why

[8822.27s -> 8847.99s]  think I can get up there that way yeah look how do I get up there I don't
[8847.99s -> 8871.68s]  understand oh cool spend all that time how much for a bottle of your hair oil
[8871.68s -> 8883.08s]  100 million dollars in in USD in United States dollars us cash not an IO not an
[8883.08s -> 8887.36s]  IOU not like oh I'm gonna do a I'll do a bank transfer no I want it I want it
[8887.36s -> 8891.64s]  like two lawyers present and I wanted to be signed and I want a hundred million
[8891.64s -> 8909.96s]  dollars US cash money real just money cash in a briefcase type shit how do I
[8909.96s -> 8916.73s]  know that you'll give me the oil I'll do it at the meeting I got a lawyer on
[8916.73s -> 8940.52s]  my side you get a lawyer on your side and out we'll do it there I hope you
[8940.52s -> 8957.14s]  have one for your movie stream I'm gonna figure that out I'm gonna use a law
[8957.14s -> 8990.79s]  firm I'm gonna use my trusted law firm gonzo and gonzo it's a funny to get the
[8990.79s -> 8996.36s]  rights to have gonzo be my lawyer would probably cost more money than just
[8997.36s -> 9002.81s]  without like a shirt on to the meeting and have like sunglasses and have like a
[9002.81s -> 9008.35s]  bad sunburn all over me and being like and being a bathing suit and be like
[9008.35s -> 9015.83s]  here's 20 grand it would cost more money to do it the other way like it
[9015.83s -> 9021.48s]  would cost gonzo as a lawyer would be like a hundred thousand dollars forget
[9021.48s -> 9027.05s]  that I can literally just show up without a lawyer and just give them a
[9027.05s -> 9032.36s]  check for 20 grand it would be less money why would you have no shirt on
[9032.56s -> 9058.62s]  I came to the beach not real why is he getting naked at the beach what are you
[9058.62s -> 9066.27s]  talking about I said I said I have no shirt with a bathing suit and like a
[9066.27s -> 9076.40s]  sunburn and sunglasses like I just came from the beach like a towel over my
[9076.40s -> 9082.27s]  shoulder let's get this deal done man let's go no I'm not naked stop saying
[9082.27s -> 9095.95s]  naked that's weird what are you talking about why were you at the beach it was
[9095.95s -> 9103.42s]  relaxing before a stressful period I don't know I'm saying like it would be
[9103.42s -> 9111.96s]  so casual instead of having to hire gonzo for a 500 grand I used to show up
[9111.96s -> 9121.77s]  with a tank top it like it like long socks dad socks how to slide through
[9121.77s -> 9140.52s]  there through like the lobby were you at the beach with gonzo no this way I

[10475.58s -> 10511.03s]  spotlight here sorry nope I'm really trying to get that spotlight out of
[10511.03s -> 10520.15s]  context that is a little strange second I'm slowly processing which is
[10520.15s -> 10526.81s]  happening all these ball fondler Andes that's out of context that that's a
[10526.81s -> 10534.89s]  little strange and it's the hot dog stream all the ball fondler Andes what
[10534.89s -> 10544.38s]  is that supposed to mean that I'm I'm I'm confusing myself they think they're
[10544.38s -> 10568.20s]  gonna get the spotlight I will have to get to it thank you up let ball fondler

[10615.10s -> 10702.15s]  oh boss fight the strat still works should have taken the bet should have
[10702.15s -> 10710.32s]  taken the bet there's still time for me to shake your hand this weapon is too
[10710.32s -> 10735.64s]  good it's so good there's no diminishing returns on this should
[10735.64s -> 10741.79s]  have taken that bet she's Andy all right should I not use that anymore it's not
[10741.79s -> 10746.26s]  okay it's not fair if I use that anymore that's too good it actually probably
[10746.26s -> 10749.92s]  should okay it's probably gonna get patched one hot dog I didn't get hit
[10749.92s -> 10761.42s]  once that's gonna get patched that's gonna get that out of the game no when
[10761.42s -> 10777.76s]  did I get hit I didn't get it once look at your health it was like that already

[10785.02s -> 10796.10s]  any more cheese strats it's just too good I've been I cheese the last two
[10796.14s -> 10804.31s]  bosses in a row and that's with no points okay if you play the alchemy
[10804.31s -> 10810.73s]  class and you get this weapon you'll just you could literally just kill
[10810.73s -> 10819.39s]  everybody I won't cheese the bosses anymore the next boss I will not cheese

[11083.17s -> 11088.58s]  fun it is fun I would not play this game for three hours if I didn't think it was

[11175.45s -> 11185.67s]  have not dodged a boss's attack in two and a half hours that's that's a fact
[11185.71s -> 11200.02s]  increases immobilization oh that's kind of good actually I like what I have
[11200.02s -> 11217.77s]  better all right ah this works now just in case I miss an item which I don't
[11217.77s -> 11230.92s]  think I'm going to okay we're good my friends watching your stream for the

[11313.51s -> 11323.05s]  when you were first presented to the Queen wait there all of a sudden there
[11323.05s -> 11331.50s]  are dialogue options there are machines wreaking havoc on the Esplanade so I
[11331.50s -> 11336.94s]  saw yes and a little too closely for my liking it's a miracle I escaped alive
[11336.94s -> 11342.18s]  just by these are valid I saw one take a volley of gunfire hold for an instant
[11342.18s -> 11347.22s]  then carry on as if nothing happened but no machine however resilient is
[11347.22s -> 11353.30s]  indestructible these automats must have a weakness some vital axle gear that we
[11353.30s -> 11358.46s]  can target I don't suppose you would know you who share their nature no blast
[11358.46s -> 11363.30s]  that is unfortunate I scoured the workshop hoping to shed some light on the
[11363.30s -> 11371.32s]  matter but to no avail there are machines wreaking havoc on the Esplanade
[11371.32s -> 11377.28s]  so I saw yes and a little too closely for my liking it's a miracle I escaped
[11377.28s -> 11382.40s]  alive just by these are valid I saw one take a volley of gunfire hold for an
[11382.40s -> 11398.16s]  instant then carry on as if nothing happened but no machine however resilient is indestructible these automats must have a weakness some vital axle gear that we can target I don't suppose you would know why we doing this again this is okay
[11398.16s -> 11410.76s]  no blast that is unfortunate I scoured the workshop hoping to shed some light on the matter wasn't that different dialogue wait that this was different dialogue there are machines oh no
[11410.76s -> 11415.88s]  just by this but no these automats some vital I don't suppose you would know no
[11415.88s -> 11425.28s]  blast I scared okay it's a little on so I was watching a YouTube video the other
[11425.28s -> 11429.52s]  night and that was weird I would cut to you like as if I'm talking to this guy
[11429.52s -> 11435.36s]  but whatever we'll just that's fine I was I guess I just don't look at the
[11435.36s -> 11440.64s]  screen okay so I was watching a YouTube video the other night and I was I may

[11736.67s -> 11751.42s]  Holly may have turned it off I'm plugged in with a wire okay there we go all right
[11751.42s -> 11764.18s]  travel whoa where should I go what's correspondence oh who cares where should
[11764.18s -> 11775.63s]  I go main quest is la city and the tool reese thank you Holly that scared the
[11775.67s -> 11781.63s]  shit out of me wait Holly you were you in the room at the the Xbox just turn on
[11781.63s -> 11791.82s]  and the TV turn on it was I pressing buttons let's get the shit out of me where
[11791.82s -> 11802.64s]  should I go la city or to the risk this game looks kind of good it is I think
[11802.64s -> 11813.38s]  it's fun really really the bosses are kind of easy but that's the kind of
[11813.38s -> 11816.82s]  character I'm playing I won't if I was a strength character I bet you'd be
[11816.82s -> 11832.34s]  having a lot more trouble I kept hearing the little dude dude okay where should I
[11832.34s -> 11838.64s]  go take the batteries out of the controller now that's a brilliant idea
[11838.64s -> 11848.54s]  that's actually a smart idea mmm honest to God that's the smartest thing I've
[11848.54s -> 11883.02s]  ever heard oh wait can I oh does that still work I'm gonna go to la city god
[11883.02s -> 11902.08s]  I wish you were real you smoking crack again it's pronounced sit a ooh I like
[11902.08s -> 11944.15s]  this area wait let me do the e3 walk it's very specific I almost got it I hope
[11944.15s -> 11950.54s]  there's an enemy here yep shit I made the game look like shit I'm sorry don't
[11950.54s -> 11979.05s]  fire me I do like this area though it's definitely not yeah do it again with
[11979.05s -> 11991.70s]  music less hellies I need souls gonna need to upgrade this weapon
[11991.70s -> 12002.05s]  dogs are too fast for that whoa whoa whoa whoa
[12002.05s -> 12015.09s]  the other one died oh they explode okay I like the fire effects in this game
[12015.57s -> 12056.05s]  my eye tricky area right it you're gonna replay it's secure oh I'd rather punch
[12056.05s -> 12068.11s]  myself in the face square in the nose then play through secure again if I had
[12068.11s -> 12072.98s]  an option here but you can punch yourself as hard as you can directly in
[12072.98s -> 12077.02s]  your face like right here or you have to start a new playthrough of secure Oh and
[12077.02s -> 12081.42s]  get to the end and beat the whole game get the true ending I'd go now I do it
[12081.42s -> 12089.78s]  now you hate secure oh no I don't hate secure oh it's just fucking impossibly
[12089.78s -> 12096.66s]  difficult I've gone back to it before in the last since beating it I just go no
[12096.66s -> 12108.32s]  no why am I doing this what's the point of you playing with I cannot come up
[12108.32s -> 12114.00s]  with a reason to play secure oh yeah that is the hardest game I've ever played
[12114.00s -> 12119.38s]  and yes I had the same thing oh you know what maybe I'll play secure oh again
[12119.38s -> 12123.02s]  that sounds kind of like fun yeah it's like really tough and but Perry's I get
[12123.06s -> 12128.70s]  that's such a fun game and you get to the first boss fight get to lady
[12128.70s -> 12137.02s]  butterfly or the big guy the big drunk guy you go what am I doing here I could
[12137.02s -> 12140.90s]  play Mario Party and you know what I mean I could know that I don't want to
[12140.90s -> 12149.87s]  do that I could do anything else skill issue that drunk guy fight well you have
[12149.87s -> 12153.91s]  to fight like 15 people and him at the same time it's just like what I why am I
[12154.35s -> 12159.67s]  why am I playing this there's no reason me to do this right now I've done that
[12159.67s -> 12173.57s]  twice all right let me pay attention please before I lose it's kicking my
[12173.57s -> 12182.88s]  ass double swing all right I've been hit by you that any of the bosses in the
[12182.88s -> 12203.54s]  game all right skill issue let's go quiet up there and I even get up there I
[12203.54s -> 12234.44s]  can't so whatever screw it bring us me strong will you get down here so I can
[12234.56s -> 12258.33s]  Jesus I dodged the other way they're the me strong playthrough I tell us it's
[12258.33s -> 12264.76s]  never gonna happen I just don't think it will because it's one thing okay yeah I
[12264.76s -> 12272.12s]  I are taking marijuana off stream and stuff right but I don't I don't know I
[12272.12s -> 12279.28s]  feel like that's really that's some kind of endorsement somehow to like dude hey
[12279.28s -> 12283.20s]  just like smoke weed and play games man just like play game while you're high
[12283.20s -> 12294.55s]  it's so much more fun yeah look at how look at how fun this is it's not yeah I
[12294.55s -> 12300.58s]  don't want to if I were to the me strong playthrough I wouldn't say anything it
[12300.58s -> 12303.38s]  would be like guys I'm doing me strong today and I wouldn't say anything else
[12303.38s -> 12311.66s]  but then people that are just like why is he sucks such as why is he so bad he
[12311.66s -> 12317.79s]  has to be making this up that right I get there's gonna be no way to hide that
[12318.15s -> 12336.08s]  because it would be undeniable what was going on yeah that's the playthrough
[12336.08s -> 12340.40s]  where I make a big caveman guy and put every single point in strength and try
[12340.40s -> 12348.24s]  to beat like get through fucking like like Godric's castle think I could do it
[12348.24s -> 12360.83s]  yeah every single point has to be in strength let's be a caveman all right
[12360.83s -> 12374.26s]  what am I missing something here didn't you stream drunk before yeah I mean
[12374.38s -> 12380.79s]  I don't know I to me there's a difference in my brain or oh I'm drinking
[12380.79s -> 12385.91s]  on stream versus I'm drunk it's this it's part of the stream is me I'm drunk
[12385.91s -> 12393.59s]  I'm drunk scream I'm drunk and I have to play this game trashed right like I could
[12393.59s -> 12398.07s]  drink on stream it's not like part of oh yeah it's because the stream is live so
[12398.07s -> 12404.51s]  that's why I'm drinking a lot I don't know how do I get up there I don't
[12404.51s -> 12410.78s]  know influencer Andy influencer Andy I mean I could just it is you know okay
[12410.78s -> 12414.94s]  this is an 18 plus story and whatever mature content warning but still I don't
[12414.94s -> 12420.61s]  wanted to make it people think that dude just like fucking get high and like play
[12420.61s -> 12424.81s]  Elden ring and it's like what I'm doing you should be that's what I do why don't
[12424.81s -> 12436.93s]  you do it too so much cooler this way I don't know it's probably a place to do
[12436.93s -> 12444.87s]  it and not be like influencer Andy I genuinely don't know how to get up there
[12445.03s -> 12475.58s]  yes it's this way yes it definitely is you're an adult do what you want yeah I
[12475.58s -> 12493.10s]  know I know I'm overthinking it I do that a lot though that's Virgo that's a
[12493.10s -> 12509.93s]  Virgo behavior I mean it makes me that I'm whatever I have a lot of those
[12509.93s -> 12528.64s]  essences it's time to crush them all right there we go are you gonna play
[12528.64s -> 12541.07s]  scorn what's scorn they're good the movement looks fun in this game it's
[12541.11s -> 12545.99s]  very clean all right however you want to look at this and talk about this a lot
[12545.99s -> 12551.03s]  of the Dark Souls kind of clone games they all have the same problem where it
[12551.03s -> 12557.35s]  it feels like kind of off somehow and we're like clunky this feels good to
[12557.35s -> 12563.46s]  play this feels good I have not had a complaint at all about how the combat
[12563.46s -> 12570.80s]  animations are or besides the hitboxes maybe it's very clean it's very polished
[12570.84s -> 12576.31s]  put it that way it's a polished game I know I did crash out but you know what
[12576.31s -> 12588.46s]  I'm saying oh my god that guy just killed me he's letting the dev down
[12588.46s -> 12603.11s]  lightly that's not what's happening I look at how many souls I have what the
[12603.11s -> 12622.00s]  hell is going on I have a lot oh my god I'm bad this reminds me of a 360 game in
[12622.00s -> 12639.03s]  a good way I know what you mean by that I know what that means damn it I had
[12639.03s -> 12643.15s]  enough and I have I just blew it wait how much how many points do I have shit
[12643.15s -> 12655.11s]  that was stupid actually I might have enough do I have enough two thousand is
[12655.11s -> 12661.65s]  it two or three thousand upgrade the weapon shit three all right I'll just
[12661.65s -> 12672.35s]  farm for a sec your face is blocking the souls why did it take you that long for
[12672.35s -> 12678.66s]  someone to tell me this I can't all tab though I have two thousand you see that
[12678.66s -> 12690.73s]  anywhere how come nobody told me this oh well you're an idiot
[12690.93s -> 12706.50s]  what was that guy doing get to 3,000 and I'm gonna turn around okay hold on now
[12706.50s -> 12756.01s]  oh that's cool stop blocking me it's not fair I'm out of stamina already
[12759.33s -> 12770.02s]  what happened to the hamster stream um to refresh people's memories it's when I
[12770.02s -> 12775.55s]  was gonna dress up with like ears and like teeth here and just be in a ball
[12775.55s -> 12780.43s]  over there and have like a couple of toys and like a one of those water
[12780.43s -> 12784.03s]  durable water things and I was gonna eat seeds and shit and I wasn't gonna say
[12784.03s -> 12789.77s]  anything and see how long until I lost like 5,000 subs it was like gonna be
[12789.77s -> 12792.77s]  experiment but I said decided against it I was gonna have a tube I could go
[12792.77s -> 12797.21s]  through between rooms and stuff and you could give me bits to like drop seeds
[12797.21s -> 12816.36s]  down that turned out it was gonna be too expensive all right so I went this way
[12816.36s -> 12825.94s]  already this is the way they came right yeah I like the heel animation it's
[12825.94s -> 12842.29s]  cool and I would have a bunch of made-up catchphrases when a new sub came in I
[12842.29s -> 12853.21s]  go oh I sure wish I had some cheese thank you so and everyone was just spam
[12853.21s -> 12855.37s]  laughing and shit even though it was not funny
[12855.37s -> 12866.88s]  hamsters don't eat cheese yeah and next I'd be like oh next time give me some
[12866.88s -> 12881.37s]  candy and go like like into the camera I wonder how many people would leave
[12881.49s -> 12897.44s]  permanently she's to meet you where am I going I never if I if the compass
[12897.44s -> 12903.99s]  didn't exist I would never have done that play hamster playground all aboard
[12903.99s -> 12908.79s]  the hamster train prepare for cuteness overload relentless training and fierce
[12908.79s -> 12912.91s]  rivalry as you and your hamsters take on challenges while traversing the maze and
[12912.91s -> 12917.40s]  riding a skateboard with more modes this is an AI somebody this is AI generated
[12917.40s -> 12922.00s]  with more modes coming soon be the first to cross the finish line to earn rewards
[12922.00s -> 12926.56s]  and yummy treats experiences fierce competition in a laid-back style you
[12926.56s -> 12937.87s]  customize your hamster while traversing the maze and riding a skateboard you
[12937.87s -> 12971.91s]  know I don't know I I'm like doing this I'm doing it hold on it's a cutscene
[12971.91s -> 12986.01s]  hold on oh dude 455 thanks for the bitch I could use some cheese he's taken an
[12986.01s -> 12990.69s]  ultimate for his aid to calm you're no more human than the machines that laid
[12990.69s -> 12993.65s]  waste to this city there's nothing stranger than that
[12993.65s -> 12999.33s]  face just what mission has the marquee entrusted you with I must meet with
[12999.33s -> 13004.93s]  Abbe Gaiquah alas you've come too late the Abbott has got it into his head to
[13004.93s -> 13009.94s]  go to the palette I can't even get it to stay there he is certain that Monseigneur
[13009.94s -> 13014.46s]  de la Far the bishop of Nancy is being held prisoner by the monstrosity that
[13014.46s -> 13019.49s]  is wreaking havoc on the Ile de la Cité but how can he possibly hope to free him
[13019.49s -> 13024.05s]  the Abbott is a holy man who would lay down his life it's a holy man justice
[13024.05s -> 13028.77s]  okay but there isn't one among us who stands the slightest chance against
[13028.77s -> 13034.69s]  that thing not the slightest chance I wonder where I go from here though I
[13034.69s -> 13041.35s]  can't get it to stay don't look up in them into the I'm just a mirror don't
[13041.35s -> 13048.57s]  look up and say here's of cheese my mouth is too watery I can't I'm such a
[13048.57s -> 13054.30s]  I'm such a greasy person I can't get my teeth to stay there I missed that whole
[13054.46s -> 13082.61s]  thing what I'm oh I gotta turn these in oh that what I looked like what the fuck
[13082.61s -> 13098.94s]  what Jesus I look horrible oh my god it looks I hate it I genuinely hate that
[13098.94s -> 13110.78s]  image oh it's like triggering a response it's triggering a response I don't I
[13110.78s -> 13133.83s]  can't alt tab but those images are triggering a response how are you
[13133.83s -> 13154.03s]  supposed to avoid it that well please show it I will before the stream ends
[13154.03s -> 13162.97s]  here we go all right I need to upgrade the weapon oh my god
[13162.97s -> 13174.46s]  cheese to me oh I I would love some cheese would you guys ironically like
[13174.46s -> 13177.02s]  that though I feel like there's a lot of people that would want me to do that
[13177.02s -> 13189.12s]  because they would it they go yeah that's that's do it that's funny with
[13189.12s -> 13192.04s]  the ratio of the amount of people that leave the community permanently versus
[13192.04s -> 13198.57s]  the amount of people that stay and give cheese bits what's the ratio do you
[13198.57s -> 13217.48s]  think I would legit call work off of that no you you would not you would fall
[13217.48s -> 13225.36s]  out sick from work if I was doing the hamster with the teeth and say cheese
[13225.36s -> 13251.43s]  bits and stuff you would call off work I would to be honest those of you that
[13251.43s -> 13259.83s]  said the game was not hard enough yeah we'll wait till you get to see the wrong
[13259.83s -> 13268.26s]  right let's wait till you get to say hello wherever we are I don't know what
[13268.26s -> 13302.15s]  zone this is so unforgiving so unforgiving oh it's brutal this game is
[13302.15s -> 13312.98s]  just so unforgiving brutal why we like it though that's why we play them brutal
[13312.98s -> 13332.48s]  oh just wait till you get to see an all I'm sorry I have too much fun when I
[13332.48s -> 13346.14s]  turn the stream on sometimes I don't I really do I have too much fun the pole
[13346.14s -> 13351.24s]  get that shit out of here I'm not that I don't care about whatever that pole says
[13351.24s -> 13360.75s]  I'd skip work for it I would unsub only 16 people would unsub but how many
[13360.75s -> 13392.01s]  people would sub ready this way I can't afford to sub I skipped work oh shit
[13392.05s -> 13413.11s]  shit okay what if you put me on the TV at work that was pretty I don't think I
[13413.11s -> 13419.22s]  supposed to even be able to do that but I okay I think I screwed that up but I
[13419.22s -> 13442.11s]  win that would be weird as fuck frost catalyst ooh all right I want that I
[13442.11s -> 13452.36s]  want the health to though frost is I got the module keys well oh no huh those of
[13452.36s -> 13457.05s]  you that said that this game was not too tough just wait till you get to the
[13457.05s -> 13526.63s]  fire poker in sienna what just blew by me what's going on oh hi I got a lot of
[13526.63s -> 13537.30s]  essences all right so it's like 80% of you would skip work to do that that's
[13537.30s -> 13584.40s]  kind of cool my soul count is 1895 2000 leave more stamina I have some okay I
[13584.52s -> 13598.67s]  gotta get to a oh wait this doesn't it's blurry this is from wait when did I say

[13654.88s -> 13711.08s]  gonna scare people oh I hate it I actually hate this

[13970.29s -> 13977.74s]  off right that doesn't look like me this is a different person it's just
[13977.74s -> 13980.62s]  different enough where if you've watched my stream a bunch of times you'd probably
[13980.62s -> 14003.49s]  say what's going on easy clicks let's go easy clicks
[14003.53s -> 14027.01s]  I'll get out of here this game's pretty fun I actually don't want to die I have

[14744.24s -> 14753.48s]  your friend on Plas Saint-Marie informed me of your intentions alas I was not
[14753.48s -> 14757.95s]  able to reach the Palais de Justice I fear that the soul of Monseigneur de la
[14757.95s -> 14763.89s]  Far has lost forever was he killed what has been done to him is a fate worse
[14763.89s -> 14770.85s]  than death far worse but I could go no further there were so many bodies so
[14770.85s -> 14776.41s]  many innocent strewn about the square he means your cringe and your community is
[14776.41s -> 14781.69s]  annoying I felt it I don't think I think that's what you think I don't think
[14781.69s -> 14787.57s]  that's what they were saying it's hopeless the streets are teeming with
[14787.57s -> 14791.65s]  machines but the machine that is wreaking havoc in the area around the
[14791.65s -> 14796.81s]  palace colossal much much larger than yourself what's more the soul of his
[14796.81s -> 14799.97s]  excellency the bishop has been imprisoned within this way he dropped

[14839.30s -> 14844.10s]  most abject poverty for there is no greater sin than to ignore the
[14844.10s -> 14855.40s]  suffering of one's brethren we're parted way gone straight I feel like I could
[14855.40s -> 14864.27s]  play that part pretty well of the court is an insult to the misery that reigns
[14864.27s -> 14872.61s]  in our lands in such dark times how can one conceive of hiding away to play
[14873.45s -> 14877.93s]  or tinker with clockwork contraptions

[15937.15s -> 15945.21s]  we must leave this place boss in you there's no time all right let's do it
[15945.25s -> 15966.74s]  see how cool this is oh hell yeah Golden Cross what's that Donald's maybe let me
[15966.74s -> 15979.75s]  take a look at my modules all right this is level two first physical damage by a
[15979.75s -> 15984.12s]  fully charged attack I feel like that's really hard to get done this one's good
[15984.12s -> 15997.98s]  do I have any other slot two slot ones don't I think these are fine all right
[15997.98s -> 16006.11s]  here we go Titan it's time for the game to impress us this is the point where
[16006.11s -> 16012.01s]  the game could impress everybody I'm curious we've fought a few mini bosses
[16012.01s -> 16029.26s]  it seems so far the game could impress us with a really cool boss fight I was I
[16029.26s -> 16059.18s]  was a hundred million years away here we go Titan fight almost time how much was
[16059.18s -> 16064.83s]  this game uh that's a good question I actually don't remember I bought this
[16064.83s -> 16074.67s]  game and then turned the stream on maybe six to seven minutes later I think was
[16075.67s -> 16094.48s]  rich Andy no I'm not saying that oh I just bought it I don't even care I just
[16094.48s -> 16098.00s]  say I I did I bought it it's like oh that's how much this was when I turned
[16098.00s -> 16113.48s]  that I took I got distracted by turning the stream on immediately okay how long
[16113.48s -> 16118.48s]  did it take to download I have fiber I know Omega low fiber like I drop frames
[16118.48s -> 16125.36s]  sometimes but it's a 1000 down connection so it's a gigabit happens
[16125.36s -> 16135.39s]  very quickly I do have a gigabit connection it's not my fault that this
[16135.39s -> 16149.69s]  some reason twitch hates my connection to the servers I know flex I mean it
[16149.69s -> 16156.41s]  really isn't because this internet costs 75% less than the internet that I had
[16156.41s -> 16166.65s]  before it it is it is a almost a hot 200 fucking dollars less expensive than the
[16166.65s -> 16184.16s]  one that I had in the other house that I was in what a perfect time I can I just
[16184.16s -> 16188.55s]  kill this guy I did this guy's are so annoying it's not why even fight these
[16188.55s -> 16208.61s]  guys pretty good frame drop timing yeah for some reason sometimes twitch just
[16208.61s -> 16213.71s]  genuinely hates wherever my traffic is coming from and I have to server hop
[16213.71s -> 16216.91s]  until I find one that lets me stream on it for a week and then I do it again
[16217.39s -> 16223.48s]  bro I pay 90 for gigabit where I am but that's what I mean I used to have to
[16223.48s -> 16230.89s]  have like this crazy business internet to get over I believe it was 10 to 20
[16230.89s -> 16242.34s]  upload which was fucking unbelievably stupid why do you stream at a low bit
[16242.34s -> 16246.06s]  rate if you're paying for fiber is you can't scream to twitch past 6,000 bit
[16246.06s -> 16268.20s]  rate they'll literally turn your stream off is the Titan is that the Titan no
[16268.24s -> 16275.84s]  it's not that's the thing we've already fought that that's not the Titan right
[16275.84s -> 16286.48s]  we just bought that thing take this to the clerk's office at the shadow it's
[16286.48s -> 16296.70s]  really wet where he is walking he's walking through like sludge why his shoes
[16296.70s -> 16333.12s]  filled with water I got the Bible all right where's this Titan nice all right
[16333.12s -> 16347.13s]  it's definitely right here I'll get to you in a minute actually let me buy a
[16347.13s -> 16359.39s]  bunch of health potions oh that's interesting you can buy these make sure
[16359.39s -> 16367.47s]  you don't lose them that's cool all right I need to buy this what do you
[16367.47s -> 16374.67s]  have to say what's wrong be not afraid I am NOT a member of the royal army you
[16374.67s -> 16378.91s]  like the game new to the stream I intend to put an end to it yeah I think it's
[16378.91s -> 16385.71s]  fun I don't think it's as hard as some of the souls games or some of the other
[16385.71s -> 16389.07s]  souls likes but it's definitely enjoyable it's a fun experience I think
[16389.07s -> 16395.35s]  good I will not hurt you you can believe me
[16395.35s -> 16401.00s]  combat's fun I'm afraid it's too late madam those whose bodies are strewn
[16401.00s -> 16405.96s]  about this square paid the ultimate price for their blind trust like me they
[16405.96s -> 16409.68s]  believed in their country in the National Guard and they were urged to
[16409.68s -> 16413.76s]  join he believed in the marketer Lafayette was to lead them to victory
[16414.00s -> 16433.11s]  you're not gonna stream this again so I didn't that's a Titan all right are you

[17028.52s -> 17034.40s]  freedom to the good habit I tell you this man is utterly irreplaceable he
[17034.40s -> 17038.48s]  has devoted himself body and soul to the mission I entrusted to him
[17038.48s -> 17042.84s]  investigating the King's entourage in particular the man who enabled him to
[17042.84s -> 17049.04s]  create this ungodly army I just made a YouTube video just cutting at the end of
[17049.04s -> 17055.76s]  sentences like dude you took a lot of takes to do that captured monsignor I
[17055.76s -> 17062.28s]  was with a big record in plasticine we've gone to speak with the volunteers
[17062.88s -> 17070.29s]  we implored them not to take our arms against the King's machines alas they
[17070.29s -> 17075.29s]  refused to eat our words and we had to leave in great haste after that
[17075.29s -> 17084.67s]  what do you I can't remember a thing those poor people these are automats

[17646.56s -> 17656.41s]  that was actually a pretty fun game I enjoyed that is it a 10 out of 10 no is
[17656.41s -> 17661.67s]  it a 5 out of 10 no is it a 6 out of 10 no it's higher is it an 8 out of 10 not
[17661.67s -> 17669.25s]  sure is it a good game yeah that was fun I think it was worth playing I would have
[17669.25s -> 17672.73s]  stopped if I didn't think it was good it was pretty fun I liked it I think it
[17672.73s -> 17676.99s]  probably gets a little bit more interesting a little bit later maybe is
[17676.99s -> 17681.59s]  it a 7 it's like between depending who you are someone between like a 7 and an
[17681.59s -> 17688.89s]  8 something I don't give ratings on this stream there's no way that's an 8
[17688.89s -> 17695.28s]  come on Gwen I'm I just I didn't say that this is it okay the game with how
[17695.28s -> 17700.20s]  do you rate a game the game was clean the animations were clean combat was fun
[17700.20s -> 17707.73s]  the bosses are a little easier than I would have liked only saw four of them
[17707.73s -> 17716.00s]  though I don't know how long the game is I thought it was fun there's definitely
[17716.00s -> 17718.00s]  enough there to be interested this definitely seems like there's enough
[17718.00s -> 17721.48s]  weapons the weapons are awesome it kind of remind me of blood-borne where
[17721.48s -> 17727.77s]  they're very cool and very different and the difficulty up I could it's pretty
[17727.77s -> 17733.01s]  cheeseable yeah but whatever I mean you don't have to play it like that I let
