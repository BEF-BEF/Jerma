[1.46s -> 6.82s]  Wait, you put a wink in? I hadn't come on. I didn't even remember how to stream. Hold on a second.
[9.06s -> 15.27s]  All right. I just did the thing. And when you do that thing, that's how you know it's time to clean
[15.27s -> 22.42s]  your room. What I've done is I stacked a glass on top of another glass, because there's no room for
[22.42s -> 33.06s]  two glasses. So it's time. It's time to clean this room. So we have a wink. Of course we do.
[33.62s -> 38.58s]  In five seconds. Disgusting pigsty. No, no, I know this. It's not that bad. This just
[38.58s -> 44.82s]  documents all over the floor of all my personal information. PlayStation 2 games and glassware
[44.82s -> 49.06s]  everywhere. It's not like it's dirty. It's just stuff. That's one thing I want to make sure. I
[49.06s -> 55.83s]  want to talk to you guys about this before. I know there's a wink. We'll get it. Dirty versus
[56.55s -> 64.44s]  clutter. Your room, my room's not dirty. It's just cluttered. There's nothing in here that's
[64.44s -> 72.97s]  disgusting. It's just stuff on the ground. So why then? Actually, no, hold on. Never mind. That's
[72.97s -> 85.66s]  a lie. There's a... Fuck. I lose. There's a glass of coffee in it. That's definitely been sitting
[85.66s -> 91.86s]  there for like at least five days. All right. I lose. I can clean the room. That's fucking
[91.86s -> 98.94s]  horrible. I just looked behind me and saw it. But anyways, I had a good break. A lot of friends
[98.94s -> 109.62s]  came up. We had a good time and moldy. No, no, no, it's not. It's not. It's fine. We'll clean it
[109.62s -> 151.27s]  right now. It's fine. It's fine. No, it's going to be fine. All right. All right. We're good.
[151.27s -> 162.55s]  Watering. I went, we dumped it. The mold got him. There's no mold. Okay. There's no mold in that
[162.55s -> 169.72s]  cup. Hold on. I got a wink. This is a spoiler. You're not supposed to see this shit yet.
[170.04s -> 204.15s]  Hey, what are we doing? All right. That was the entire right side of a magazine. If you have like
[204.15s -> 213.38s]  the Cosmopolitan magazine, that was the entire right page for a fucking scent ad. You just
[213.38s -> 222.18s]  put text to it that says like stunning, daring, smells, and then like dot, dot, dot. Invigoration,
[222.18s -> 231.62s]  whatever the hell you think. A whole page ad. Fuck off with these whole page ads. You want to know
[231.62s -> 238.58s]  why nobody reads magazines anymore? Because the thing is 35 pages thick and there's 18 pages of
[238.58s -> 253.00s]  ads. That's why nobody reads them anymore. I winked. I winked like three times. Dude, I can't imagine
[255.03s -> 261.88s]  having a magazine company right now and the only people that read it are people that have
[261.88s -> 267.16s]  phones that are about to die at the doctor's office and they don't want to sit there and read
[267.16s -> 280.22s]  their phones. It's like, fuck, I have to read something else here. I forgot the Lord of the
[280.22s -> 286.30s]  Rings was in the background. Sorry. Hey, let me redo that one. You heard it. The only people
[286.30s -> 288.86s]  that read magazines are people that are bored at the doctor's office that don't want to fucking
[288.86s -> 292.86s]  know you heard it. I'm going to play Lord of the Rings Return of the King on PlayStation 2 today
[293.74s -> 299.82s]  and I felt it was appropriate. I'm returning to streaming after about eight or nine days,
[299.82s -> 305.18s]  so we're going to return to the king. Now it's too quiet. I'll fix it. Don't worry.
[305.82s -> 313.53s]  I'm going to explain why you are late. No, that's a pre-stream thing. That's a pre-stream thing and
[313.53s -> 322.39s]  now we'll find it'll be a now stream thing. I hate starting an activity where I know I'm going to be
[322.39s -> 327.62s]  long-term locked in, but it doesn't matter what it is. I could be going fishing for all that matters
[328.18s -> 334.42s]  and if I have a dump building, that's a bad way to put it. Let's be medical about this.
[334.42s -> 344.33s]  If I have to use the bathroom imminently, I do not want to do anything until that is taken care
[344.33s -> 354.02s]  of. It doesn't matter what it is. So I had to take care of that before I started my live stream,
[354.02s -> 358.18s]  because if you do not take care of that, if you do not let the process get started and finish,
[359.11s -> 365.19s]  then you are stuck. You are stuck needing to go use the restroom. You have to use the bathroom
[365.19s -> 370.94s]  at some point in an opportunity that might not be the greatest time. I hate that. No,
[370.94s -> 376.20s]  it doesn't happen to me. The reason why it happened today is because I ate food after 11
[376.20s -> 381.08s]  o'clock last night, which is like, come on, what am I thinking? That's how you make that happen.
[381.08s -> 385.50s]  All right, I'm going to play. No, I didn't even have a tweet. Hold on. No, it's because I had to
[385.50s -> 398.66s]  wink. Go back to the intro. We're not ready. Oh, we have huge bits coming in too. Bilactery gave...
[398.66s -> 405.14s]  Let me get the good one. Hold on. Let me get the good one out. Why am I... What are these pictures
[405.14s -> 410.15s]  on my phone? What am I doing? All right, hold on. All right, I'll be right back. I'm up.
[423.54s -> 430.65s]  Okay, this is funny to me because if you just browse your Twitter and you knew that I... Oh,
[430.65s -> 434.17s]  yeah, that's right. Durham has been gone. Durham has been gone for like 10 days.
[434.97s -> 444.76s]  The first tweet is, return of the king. And then a link to my Twitch. How many people might just
[444.76s -> 449.74s]  scroll by them and be like, really, dude? Like, return of the fucking king. Oh, wow. You were
[449.74s -> 457.51s]  gone for like a week and a half. You're the best. Yeah, return of the king. Whatever. All right,
[457.51s -> 467.82s]  what does everybody ask? No, somebody gave me money. Here's the worst part about when you don't...
[467.82s -> 475.42s]  Okay, I haven't turned my computer on for 10 days. So how many updates does your computer fucking
[475.42s -> 481.74s]  have to do? You just don't even realize just how much shit your computer does in the background.
[481.82s -> 491.00s]  10 days of no updates and no downloads and shit. It's so obnoxious. Anyway, Spylactery gave $50.
[494.60s -> 502.47s]  Wait, we losing friends? No, we're not. Why'd you say clocks? They say, glad you're back,
[502.47s -> 505.99s]  Jerma. I was watching your old Stardew Valley streams and holy shit, you were bad at the game.
[506.71s -> 509.51s]  You've grown a lot as a streamer and we're all very proud of my boy.
[515.46s -> 522.95s]  I'm not... It's all right. It's okay. And 15 community subs from Amferic. Thanks, Amferic.
[523.59s -> 533.69s]  Yeah, welcome back, everybody. You didn't forget about me. That's good. A weekend on the internet
[533.69s -> 538.17s]  is like three years real time. You know what I mean? I'm surprised everyone even knows who I am.
[538.89s -> 552.38s]  But thank you, Spylactery. Thank you, Amferic. This time. Lord of the Rings for the return of
[552.38s -> 563.38s]  the king on PlayStation 2. I'm ready. A little blurry, but what am I going to do?
[564.98s -> 568.74s]  We're not playing on hard. This is not going to be a 16-hour stream.
[568.74s -> 578.31s]  Lord of the Rings, return of the king. I'm not playing on hard. We're doing normal. Here we go.
[579.03s -> 585.21s]  Adventure MFDN 5 community subs. Thank you, Dan. Played on hard. Did you see how fucking horrible
[585.21s -> 589.70s]  this game was the last one? You don't want me to do this on hard. I don't want to do this on hard.
[590.98s -> 602.66s]  No. Why would I do that? I'm not going to do that. Here we go. Lord of the Rings, the return of the
[602.66s -> 611.61s]  king. We last left our heroes when they were having a good time. Of course, it's a fucking THX
[612.25s -> 623.38s]  at the beginning of the THX certified game. Good. Did it break the speakers?
[626.54s -> 633.11s]  You did the THX sound too loud. You broke the speakers. Do you ever think the guy in
[633.11s -> 637.27s]  the projection room during the THX sound is going like, oh fuck, oh fuck, it's going to happen?
[645.18s -> 649.50s]  Now what? Why is this so soft? Come on, Batman. Thanks for the 10 subs.
[651.51s -> 655.43s]  I think it actually did break the speakers. Why does this sound like tinny? Does it sound
[655.43s -> 673.03s]  tinny to anybody else? It sounds tinny. Why does it sound like it's coming down a hallway?
[680.17s -> 683.77s]  It's actually broken. I can't even hear this.
[684.94s -> 697.58s]  A hanostanet of the enemy is growing. What? Sauron will use his puppet son-man to destroy the people
[697.58s -> 704.46s]  of Rohan. My headphones weren't plugged in all the way. It's been a week, guys.
[711.61s -> 729.00s]  Here we go. Another old movie. Here comes the DM. No, don't DMCA. This is a cut scene in the game.
[729.96s -> 744.63s]  Yeah, this is when we last left our heroes at the Battle of Home Depot.
[745.51s -> 759.48s]  You know what's funny about this stream? I'm going to be really honest with you.
[760.76s -> 767.93s]  The only reason why I'm playing this is because I bought it. I didn't want to play this,
[769.13s -> 774.22s]  but I can't not play it. I bought all three of them together.
[774.22s -> 782.38s]  The wizard is never late, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he needs to.
[782.38s -> 787.26s]  Somebody do it. Do it. Do late. That's the line right there. That's actually the line.
[788.22s -> 799.02s]  Screamer is never late, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he accidentally forgets
[799.02s -> 805.50s]  to eat and might have a shit building up in him for three hours and can't start on time.
[809.08s -> 821.00s]  Seamless transition. Let's go. I get to play as Gandalf, too.
[823.74s -> 829.27s]  I already leveled up. I'm already in perfect mode.
[838.62s -> 847.96s]  Why does Gandalf look like this Star Wars kid? He's kind of flailing around.
[853.42s -> 871.40s]  That was kind of fun. What has Gandalf's staff made out of? Wood? Is it wood? Well,
[871.40s -> 874.44s]  I have to play as Gandalf the whole game. I don't care what any other character does.
[879.21s -> 902.98s]  Probably wood. Ranged. I'm gonna die. What the hell was I doing? Wait, blow it up from back here?
[906.95s -> 912.07s]  Gandalf gameplay, Resident Sleeper. You mean Gandalf gameplay, guaranteed victory.
[913.05s -> 920.52s]  I guess that is Resident Sleeper. Shit, you're right. I was wrong there. All right, what am I
[920.52s -> 942.39s]  doing? R1, action. All right, I gotta be careful. Did I get it? Did I not get it? I just didn't hit
[942.39s -> 957.02s]  anybody. What the fuck am I doing? What is Gandalf throwing spears at me? I have magical powers.
[957.02s -> 968.54s]  Why would I need to do this? Oh, there we go. Yeah, I gotta get rid of that. I'm gonna die.
[970.92s -> 995.32s]  Can Gandalf die? Give us Frodo. Frodo's not even in this game. What do you mean? No,
[995.32s -> 1001.48s]  we don't give spoilers. No, we can talk spoilers. We can talk. You've seen the last two movies. We
[1001.48s -> 1014.92s]  played them on stream. Yes, I did. I played Fellowship of the Ring and I played two towers
[1014.92s -> 1033.05s]  on stream. We watched them. You... No one watched it, though. I mean, no one watched you. The skill
[1033.05s -> 1036.41s]  meter determines the kill rating. Earn higher ratings by swinging to get the successful hits.
[1036.41s -> 1042.89s]  Best song in the... Best song? This song right here could potentially be the best song that has
[1042.89s -> 1051.64s]  been written since like the 1700s. Fair ratings are the easiest to get, but generate the fewest
[1051.72s -> 1062.42s]  experience points. Good and excellent ratings are worth more. Yeah, I know how to do that. We've
[1062.42s -> 1069.96s]  seen the last movie. We already know how this works. Remember, won't read this comment? Well,
[1069.96s -> 1077.18s]  now you owe me a thousand dollars. Was that on the line? I don't know. Pushing the skill
[1077.18s -> 1080.78s]  meter into perfect will enhance your attack damage and generate maximum experience points.
[1084.58s -> 1094.17s]  Hey. Hey, welcome back, guys. It's been a while. How are you doing? I only got two perfects. How?
[1099.34s -> 1104.97s]  So we... Is Gandalf... Is Gandalf resident sleeper? I'm not playing as Gimli again. He's the worst
[1104.97s -> 1119.05s]  character in the game. Look at this. Oh, you can do it for all. You can do it for all. I know this...
[1119.05s -> 1127.99s]  I know this is... We usually don't stop the stream for the typical... When I say typical,
[1127.99s -> 1133.99s]  I mean like a typical like one sub or one donation. We usually don't do that, but I have to stop here.
[1134.79s -> 1140.10s]  Um, it's Marvash McGally says, it's good seeing you play one of my childhood games. I completed
[1140.10s -> 1146.62s]  this when I was 12. You better finish this. Thanks for the two dollars and 50 cents though. That's...
[1147.58s -> 1168.76s]  I had to read that because I've just been called out. So 15 hours stream. This is not going to be
[1168.76s -> 1173.21s]  a 15 hour stream. You know why that is? This is important. I haven't talked about this. I've...
[1173.21s -> 1179.21s]  I start physical therapy this week. If I lock myself in here for 15 hours today and I go to
[1179.29s -> 1185.61s]  physical therapy, I'm going to have to explain to the doctor that I... How long have you been
[1185.61s -> 1192.28s]  sitting in that chair? Uh, I usually six, six to seven hours. That's... Oh, but you do stretches?
[1192.28s -> 1198.60s]  Yeah, I try to. What about last night? 15 hours? No, I'm not going to the doctor with that info.
[1205.94s -> 1218.31s]  Just lie. Don't you know? What's that old saying? This, this three people you don't lie to? Your
[1218.31s -> 1226.82s]  doctor, your financial advisor, and your lawyer, and your wife, and your husband. It's a five.
[1234.26s -> 1243.80s]  And your mother. And don't lie to your parents. Uh, don't lie. No, just don't lie to anybody. Okay,
[1243.80s -> 1251.18s]  all right. I gotta pay attention. 6900 points. Orc Hewer. I mean, this is just... Everybody needs
[1251.18s -> 1268.47s]  this. X, X. Yeah, this is a standard combo. It's cheap if a Gandalf though. Yeah, I'm just playing.
[1268.47s -> 1273.86s]  I want to play with Gandalf. Wait, hold on. You can play as the hobbits? I don't remember that.
[1274.42s -> 1288.90s]  That's... interests me for some reason. I don't know why. Okay, looks good. Replay? No. How do
[1288.90s -> 1295.34s]  I get the hell out of here? How do I continue? I see continue down there. Do I have to go all
[1295.34s -> 1310.60s]  the way down? Shit. Play as Sam. I'm probably gonna get my ass kicked if I play with Sam.
[1311.16s -> 1323.58s]  I don't think I'm into that. I'll be honest. You want me to beat the final level?
[1325.58s -> 1331.02s]  The last free kingdom of men. His war on this country will come swiftly.
[1333.02s -> 1337.74s]  He senses the ring will draw close and the strength of the ring bearer will fail.
[1343.02s -> 1347.42s]  Oh, let me get this on screen. It's great. In the end, this war must be decided by the
[1347.42s -> 1350.86s]  smallest of things. Imagine somebody laughing at the Lord of the Rings movie like this.
[1350.86s -> 1357.02s]  The ring wanted to be found. Here's... Oh boy. The task began when I beheld it upon the floor of...
[1357.02s -> 1362.14s]  Sad story. Somebody's entire... Imagine watching Lord of the Rings in the theaters
[1362.70s -> 1365.82s]  when people were screaming and cheering and yelling at every fucking other line.
[1367.75s -> 1372.31s]  Somebody had their movie ruined, one of the best franchises ever, by being in the movie theater
[1372.31s -> 1380.68s]  watching it like on launch. Still questions needed answering. Secrets only Minas Tirith,
[1380.68s -> 1388.65s]  ancient city of men could reveal. The year 3434 of the second age who follows the account will be
[1389.61s -> 1396.39s]  Should I have to press a few beeps here to get this on screen?
[1396.39s -> 1401.96s]  It has come to me. The one ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.
[1401.96s -> 1406.38s]  All those who follow in my bloodline shall be brisk.
[1409.67s -> 1411.51s]  It is precious to me.
[1416.70s -> 1419.26s]  It was in this moment... This is the future of movies, guys.
[1421.42s -> 1428.76s]  I would weave a plan for a great war, yet count upon others...
[1428.76s -> 1431.80s]  In movie advertising. They're just not going to care anymore.
[1431.80s -> 1436.60s]  It was the destiny of Aragorn, heir to the throne, to lead this war.
[1436.60s -> 1439.78s]  Let me see that again. I once saw warriors of every race
[1439.78s -> 1442.26s]  fighting as companions alongside him.
[1442.26s -> 1445.54s]  This is good. I like it. Together we would spring a great trap.
[1445.54s -> 1449.38s]  All right. If I made this... Okay. If I made a streamer cologne.
[1451.24s -> 1455.00s]  No one's done that shit. People sell fucking mice.
[1456.12s -> 1458.52s]  Gaming keyboards. No, no, no. What if I sold a cologne?
[1459.88s -> 1464.06s]  People need to branch out, man. It's not all about your gamer chair.
[1464.14s -> 1467.93s]  It's about, like, a nice fucking eau de toileur.
[1468.94s -> 1472.39s]  For they, like us, will be in great peril.
[1472.39s -> 1478.15s]  Cologne that smells like me. No, that's strange.
[1478.15s -> 1479.83s]  I'm not... No, absolutely not.
[1479.83s -> 1482.23s]  It would be a cologne that I would think would... I...
[1482.23s -> 1489.59s]  That smells good. And that scent would be...
[1489.59s -> 1491.03s]  It would be a combination of a couple things.
[1491.03s -> 1494.95s]  It would be... Right when you pull open a green jolly rancher,
[1494.95s -> 1497.03s]  that immediate scent that hits your nostrils.
[1497.03s -> 1498.31s]  That'd be... It'd be in there somewhere.
[1498.31s -> 1500.71s]  Like, that green apple smell would be there.
[1502.12s -> 1506.28s]  Surrounded by a nice eau de.
[1506.28s -> 1509.08s]  And then wood. Like a wood smell.
[1509.08s -> 1510.36s]  Like a burning wood smell.
[1510.92s -> 1513.82s]  You know that when you have a campfire going,
[1513.82s -> 1516.38s]  you get that wood burn smell?
[1517.26s -> 1518.82s]  I think it would be pretty good.
[1521.27s -> 1522.31s]  All right. Path of the King.
[1522.31s -> 1526.55s]  I think... It's like a backwards level skill tree here.
[1526.55s -> 1528.39s]  Escape from Osgiloth.
[1529.03s -> 1533.27s]  Those of you guys don't know what eau de is.
[1533.99s -> 1537.98s]  OED. I'm dead serious.
[1538.62s -> 1541.90s]  People think... Don't tell me I'm crazy until you smell it.
[1542.70s -> 1545.74s]  Eau de is an incredible smell.
[1545.74s -> 1547.50s]  It's like one of the best scents ever made.
[1547.50s -> 1548.30s]  It's incredible.
[1549.10s -> 1550.70s]  OED. Smell it.
[1552.95s -> 1553.83s]  Path of the Dead.
[1555.14s -> 1558.18s]  Oh, is this the one... The storyline that Peter Jackson
[1558.98s -> 1560.66s]  wished he deleted from the whole entire movie?
[1561.30s -> 1568.50s]  Let's do this one.
[1568.50s -> 1570.26s]  Locked? Who are the other characters?
[1570.82s -> 1573.22s]  There are three secret fucking characters?
[1574.98s -> 1576.18s]  Why is Gandalf locked?
[1576.98s -> 1578.02s]  I just unlocked him.
[1599.69s -> 1601.05s]  He wasn't in that fight.
[1601.05s -> 1603.53s]  Oh, it's because you have the trial version.
[1606.20s -> 1607.40s]  This is the demo disc.
[1611.40s -> 1613.45s]  Okay, guys, sorry.
[1613.45s -> 1616.33s]  I only got like the first two levels and two characters.
[1619.69s -> 1621.37s]  Oh, by the way, I'm going to play through this
[1622.09s -> 1624.01s]  two level demo a hundred times.
[1626.01s -> 1627.61s]  Welcome to 1996.
[1629.69s -> 1633.38s]  Adam Sildur's heir received the ring of power
[1633.38s -> 1638.41s]  and also carries before him
[1638.41s -> 1641.29s]  the only weapon Sauron cannot abide
[1641.29s -> 1645.46s]  and the only power before which a dead king and his army...
[1645.46s -> 1647.86s]  I have to have my soul to fucking goddamn scent.
[1648.58s -> 1649.54s]  I got to look into this.
[1650.42s -> 1651.99s]  I'm going to look into this.
[1651.99s -> 1652.87s]  That's funny to me.
[1652.87s -> 1654.71s]  That's funny enough for me to set my eyes on it
[1654.71s -> 1656.39s]  and lose a shitload of money and do it.
[1657.94s -> 1660.26s]  Deep inside this haunted mountain,
[1660.90s -> 1663.14s]  they will face terrible trials.
[1663.70s -> 1668.01s]  They must overcome the wrath of an ancient, cursed realm
[1668.01s -> 1669.45s]  and summon forth its king.
[1672.50s -> 1675.38s]  Out of darkness, Aragorn must call an army
[1675.38s -> 1677.86s]  even Sauron's horde cannot withstand.
[1677.86s -> 1679.22s]  Call it Jurfium.
[1679.22s -> 1680.10s]  No, that's weird.
[1681.38s -> 1683.78s]  The living cannot defend Minas Tirith
[1684.34s -> 1687.30s]  without the fury of those long dead.
[1687.86s -> 1689.62s]  I'm going to call it Liquid Mold.
[1690.98s -> 1692.82s]  You think anyone would spray it near their face?
[1693.22s -> 1706.26s]  The dead linger on this path, but we must walk it to the end.
[1707.30s -> 1707.78s]  Hold on.
[1708.50s -> 1709.30s]  Just practicing.
[1717.14s -> 1718.42s]  Oh yeah, you have no camera control on this.
[1718.42s -> 1718.90s]  I forgot.
[1718.90s -> 1719.78s]  All right, I got to be careful.
[1720.58s -> 1723.43s]  The way is shut.
[1724.23s -> 1726.07s]  It is made for those who are dead.
[1728.26s -> 1731.78s]  Yeah, Peter Jackson wished he deleted this entire sequence, right?
[1734.18s -> 1735.38s]  He hated this part.
[1735.38s -> 1738.10s]  He was like, that's the biggest mistake of my whole career.
[1739.06s -> 1741.96s]  You know, he really said that.
[1741.96s -> 1743.32s]  He actually like talked about that.
[1743.32s -> 1753.61s]  I swear to God, he actually just hit me.
[1754.57s -> 1763.82s]  Oh, what?
[1763.82s -> 1764.38s]  I couldn't kill it.
[1765.10s -> 1767.51s]  It's kind of hard to see.
[1768.23s -> 1770.50s]  German knows Peter Jackson.
[1771.80s -> 1774.60s]  No, I just know of the YouTube video I clicked on
[1774.60s -> 1776.28s]  that talked about in the article
[1776.28s -> 1778.60s]  about how he didn't like this scene
[1778.60s -> 1780.68s]  and he didn't like this whole sequence.
[1781.40s -> 1797.13s]  Come on, land, land, do something.
[1798.09s -> 1800.73s]  Oh God, he never said that.
[1801.37s -> 1801.69s]  Yes, he did.
[1805.05s -> 1816.34s]  Jesus, this is very ugly.
[1816.34s -> 1817.94s]  Why is this uglier than the last one?
[1819.37s -> 1820.65s]  Am I misremembering things
[1820.65s -> 1822.57s]  or is this actually uglier than the second game?
[1823.37s -> 1824.62s]  It's the same console.
[1825.34s -> 1833.59s]  I feel like I'm watching a YouTube playthrough
[1833.59s -> 1835.59s]  of this game that was uploaded in 2007.
[1837.61s -> 1838.09s]  Is it not?
[1839.05s -> 1841.85s]  Why does this look so bad?
[1845.93s -> 1853.77s]  All right, we need some blocks.
[1859.02s -> 1860.30s]  Break this, right?
[1864.94s -> 1865.98s]  Nice emulator.
[1865.98s -> 1867.34s]  This is not on an emulator.
[1867.98s -> 1871.18s]  This is on PlayStation 2, slim edition.
[1871.74s -> 1874.20s]  I might actually turn it up.
[1874.20s -> 1875.24s]  I think I'm actually going to go
[1875.24s -> 1876.04s]  and do some adjustments.
[1877.94s -> 1878.66s]  All right, hold on.
[1878.66s -> 1879.54s]  It's because it's dark.
[1879.54s -> 1881.46s]  All right, you got that image, right?
[1881.46s -> 1882.82s]  Let's do some adjustments.
[1882.82s -> 1888.76s]  Okay.
[1888.76s -> 1890.12s]  All right, looking better.
[1890.12s -> 1896.78s]  A little bit more contrast.
[1896.78s -> 1899.78s]  How's that saturation?
[1899.78s -> 1900.82s]  A little bit deeper.
[1900.82s -> 1915.72s]  That actually looks a lot better.
[1915.72s -> 1918.20s]  Yeah, because this is where it was before.
[1918.20s -> 1919.64s]  That's why it looks so fucking wrong.
[1919.64s -> 1920.76s]  It's like dark.
[1920.76s -> 1922.81s]  Had bad contrast.
[1922.81s -> 1927.11s]  Look it up with an HDMI LOL.
[1929.90s -> 1931.96s]  You think there's an HDMI on the back
[1931.96s -> 1933.96s]  of my PlayStation 2 slim edition?
[1933.96s -> 1936.71s]  Can I throw?
[1936.71s -> 1937.19s]  Yeah, I can.
[1937.19s -> 1937.75s]  How do I throw?
[1944.30s -> 1947.02s]  You guys could like not watch me do this and help.
[1950.20s -> 1951.00s]  It's an upscaler.
[1951.00s -> 1952.04s]  It's on an upscaler right now.
[1954.09s -> 1956.65s]  I play all the old consoles through an upscaler.
[1959.38s -> 1961.86s]  So I think it's kind of an ugly portion of the game.
[1963.10s -> 1964.62s]  The first sequence didn't look like this.
[1979.19s -> 1982.31s]  Like the battle of Home Depot didn't look like this.
[1983.27s -> 1990.66s]  Killed.
[1990.66s -> 1997.67s]  It's the battle of lows now.
[2001.30s -> 2004.78s]  Come on, build up the pits and perfects.
[2005.50s -> 2006.38s]  This is perfect cheesing.
[2006.38s -> 2007.10s]  This is how you do it.
[2007.82s -> 2009.74s]  Just stand in the middle and just bam, square.
[2010.54s -> 2012.71s]  Break a shield.
[2013.43s -> 2026.76s]  You know what else it is?
[2026.76s -> 2029.48s]  They're surrounded by this ugly goo.
[2046.34s -> 2047.14s]  Yard sale.
[2047.94s -> 2049.96s]  No, this is not a yard sale brawl.
[2053.69s -> 2055.29s]  Why would a yard sale be in a cave?
[2055.93s -> 2063.54s]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[2064.26s -> 2065.70s]  There's no video game on the screen.
[2065.70s -> 2068.10s]  There's just weird pixelated green water.
[2069.14s -> 2075.88s]  They might unlock a move.
[2076.44s -> 2081.54s]  What's it?
[2081.54s -> 2083.38s]  It's X, X, A.
[2083.38s -> 2084.74s]  No, X, X, triangle.
[2085.69s -> 2086.89s]  Didn't I unlock it for everybody?
[2087.53s -> 2091.90s]  Did I just grab the ring?
[2097.86s -> 2098.34s]  All right.
[2100.68s -> 2102.28s]  Can I put one of you guys on this?
[2103.16s -> 2114.22s]  No, don't mind.
[2114.22s -> 2115.02s]  Just go ahead.
[2115.02s -> 2115.82s]  Go on, guys.
[2117.19s -> 2118.63s]  I'll just do fucking everything.
[2119.35s -> 2126.54s]  They just do.
[2126.54s -> 2127.74s]  They're just up there vibing.
[2128.30s -> 2129.98s]  Yeah, let's get the fuck down here.
[2138.78s -> 2140.10s]  Oh, God.
[2141.30s -> 2143.78s]  Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly.
[2152.92s -> 2153.40s]  Let's go.
[2153.40s -> 2153.88s]  Build it up.
[2154.52s -> 2162.23s]  Did I get it?
[2162.23s -> 2163.03s]  Got it.
[2163.03s -> 2170.89s]  I can't even get over there.
[2176.70s -> 2177.58s]  I get it finally.
[2179.02s -> 2180.06s]  I can't even go over here.
[2184.12s -> 2185.72s]  Nice PS2 Slim Edition.
[2187.74s -> 2188.22s]  Don't make...
[2188.22s -> 2190.30s]  The PS2 Slim Edition is an amazing console,
[2190.30s -> 2191.42s]  which would literally fit anywhere.
[2193.45s -> 2196.17s]  You know the weird places I had to put this fucking thing
[2196.17s -> 2197.05s]  when I was in my bedroom?
[2200.63s -> 2202.55s]  This thing could fit anywhere.
[2202.55s -> 2212.12s]  The PS2 Slim Edition is as big as like eight credit cards.
[2212.92s -> 2213.80s]  It can go anywhere.
[2214.52s -> 2221.85s]  Can we move?
[2221.85s -> 2228.31s]  Did you put it in a Ziploc bag or something?
[2228.31s -> 2231.27s]  No, but you could stuff this somewhere behind like a bureau.
[2232.89s -> 2233.85s]  It fit everywhere.
[2234.65s -> 2236.98s]  You could go under your desk.
[2237.70s -> 2239.06s]  You could go on top of your desk.
[2239.86s -> 2242.17s]  What is this camera angle?
[2245.88s -> 2246.92s]  What is this camera?
[2251.91s -> 2252.95s]  I don't even know what's happening.
[2252.95s -> 2253.67s]  I think I'm winning.
[2254.55s -> 2266.92s]  Remember, please, stop you making chat.
[2266.92s -> 2267.56s]  What?
[2267.56s -> 2268.76s]  What are you talking about?
[2268.76s -> 2270.18s]  Is it clear on my end?
[2270.18s -> 2270.90s]  No, not at all.
[2271.78s -> 2279.40s]  Oh, there we go.
[2279.40s -> 2279.88s]  Finally.
[2280.76s -> 2286.20s]  Is it clear on your end?
[2286.20s -> 2287.32s]  No, no, it's not.
[2287.32s -> 2288.36s]  It looks like your end.
[2293.35s -> 2295.11s]  Bureau is French for desk.
[2295.11s -> 2296.31s]  Yeah, that's what I called it.
[2296.31s -> 2297.99s]  Am I weird for saying the word bureau now?
[2299.11s -> 2301.90s]  How much should I charge for the Cologne?
[2301.90s -> 2304.38s]  Should it be something stupid so nobody buys it?
[2305.34s -> 2321.34s]  No, I do have a combo.
[2322.54s -> 2331.32s]  I could do without it popping up on the screen every time.
[2331.32s -> 2336.62s]  Probably $20.
[2338.07s -> 2339.43s]  You don't think it should be like 80?
[2340.31s -> 2343.54s]  I'm only going to make like 10 of these.
[2348.81s -> 2351.37s]  You know, are you sure you don't want me to have articles written about me?
[2351.85s -> 2353.45s]  Streamer is such an egomaniac.
[2353.45s -> 2356.17s]  He has a $120 Cologne that he's selling.
[2356.89s -> 2359.69s]  I mean, that's publicity for the community.
[2375.93s -> 2376.81s]  Egomaniac.
[2377.77s -> 2382.09s]  I wonder how many bottles I could reliably actually get to manufacture.
[2385.51s -> 2388.31s]  Look, if you buy one of these Colognes, you'll...
[2390.54s -> 2391.90s]  They last a long time.
[2391.90s -> 2394.38s]  Guys, I've bought Cologne that I still have since high school.
[2395.10s -> 2405.85s]  I swear to God.
[2412.90s -> 2414.18s]  15-year-old Cologne.
[2414.18s -> 2414.66s]  More than that.
[2416.70s -> 2418.06s]  Try like 20.
[2418.06s -> 2419.58s]  What the fuck is going on right now?
[2420.14s -> 2420.38s]  What?
[2421.26s -> 2422.14s]  Am I dead?
[2422.94s -> 2426.47s]  I just got like trapped in the corner.
[2427.11s -> 2428.15s]  Nice Aragon.
[2428.15s -> 2428.71s]  Good job.
[2429.35s -> 2430.63s]  Good work, Aragon.
[2430.63s -> 2432.71s]  Or Legolas, whichever one of you.
[2432.71s -> 2433.35s]  Good job.
[2434.07s -> 2435.03s]  You're doing great.
[2435.91s -> 2450.76s]  Give me a break.
[2450.76s -> 2453.78s]  This is why we need you to be Sam.
[2456.28s -> 2458.92s]  Am I going to be the first person that beats this game as Samwise?
[2459.64s -> 2466.01s]  Does he even have any combos?
[2467.69s -> 2469.18s]  Does Sam have a combo?
[2471.93s -> 2472.49s]  I feel like...
[2473.29s -> 2475.13s]  So Triangle is Fierce Attack.
[2475.13s -> 2476.97s]  X is Light Attack.
[2477.61s -> 2478.73s]  Square is Parry.
[2478.73s -> 2479.45s]  Right?
[2479.45s -> 2482.57s]  Why do I feel like he's going to have a stab with X and then...
[2483.29s -> 2483.77s]  Oh!
[2483.77s -> 2484.41s]  Oh!
[2484.41s -> 2484.81s]  Oh!
[2484.81s -> 2485.13s]  Oh!
[2485.13s -> 2486.01s]  Oh!
[2486.01s -> 2487.13s]  Instead of any other moves.
[2487.13s -> 2487.61s]  Like it'll be...
[2487.61s -> 2488.49s]  I can make him say ooh.
[2489.37s -> 2498.63s]  Get in here and help.
[2499.27s -> 2503.32s]  There's a funny ooh noise.
[2503.32s -> 2503.72s]  Thank you.
[2504.52s -> 2506.60s]  Make sure you buy a Cologne on your way out.
[2506.60s -> 2507.40s]  They're only $100.
[2508.60s -> 2517.54s]  All fair.
[2518.26s -> 2525.42s]  Ooh, what's this?
[2525.98s -> 2528.86s]  What is this?
[2528.86s -> 2530.98s]  Is it a rock?
[2534.41s -> 2536.17s]  Oh, that's what we needed to do.
[2537.54s -> 2537.86s]  Cool.
[2538.74s -> 2542.62s]  I remember playing this level when I was younger
[2542.62s -> 2545.10s]  and having Perfect almost the entire time I played.
[2548.63s -> 2549.83s]  How the fuck did I do that?
[2553.72s -> 2554.36s]  That almost seems...
[2555.32s -> 2557.98s]  Like, not even achievable.
[2562.17s -> 2563.74s]  Dude, that was pretty good.
[2568.26s -> 2569.06s]  Dude, almost there.
[2569.06s -> 2569.38s]  Come on!
[2571.53s -> 2572.49s]  Oh, you idiots.
[2573.21s -> 2577.85s]  I had it.
[2577.85s -> 2579.05s]  Normal is easy.
[2580.30s -> 2581.82s]  Yeah, that's true.
[2581.82s -> 2582.62s]  Hey, Jerma sucks.
[2582.62s -> 2584.14s]  Thanks for saying I suck.
[2584.14s -> 2586.78s]  Thanks for the five community suck subs.
[2586.78s -> 2587.18s]  Thank you.
[2588.06s -> 2593.53s]  Let me get out of here.
[2593.53s -> 2603.32s]  We're not down here.
[2603.32s -> 2603.88s]  I'll come down.
[2605.72s -> 2606.68s]  Thanks for the subs.
[2607.40s -> 2614.04s]  Oh, here's the thing.
[2614.04s -> 2616.20s]  Okay, let's say I make this Cologne.
[2616.20s -> 2617.32s]  I know I'm on the Cologne thing,
[2617.32s -> 2618.04s]  but you gotta give me...
[2618.04s -> 2618.60s]  Just give me a sec.
[2619.40s -> 2621.00s]  Let's say I make this Cologne
[2621.00s -> 2621.96s]  and it turns out like, holy shit,
[2621.96s -> 2622.60s]  it's actually...
[2622.60s -> 2623.80s]  What a combination of scents.
[2624.44s -> 2625.96s]  This is fucking fantastic.
[2625.96s -> 2627.56s]  This is actually really good.
[2627.56s -> 2629.08s]  And I don't know,
[2629.08s -> 2630.52s]  some celebrity gets ahold of it.
[2631.32s -> 2633.61s]  Do I just sell the rights to them?
[2633.61s -> 2634.49s]  Like a million dollars?
[2635.21s -> 2647.29s]  But they can just like change the name.
[2648.01s -> 2648.41s]  Whatever.
[2650.17s -> 2651.85s]  And then I can hire Danny DeVito
[2651.85s -> 2652.97s]  to be in a skit.
[2652.97s -> 2657.14s]  That's the long con here.
[2657.14s -> 2658.74s]  That's the long game here, guys.
[2658.74s -> 2672.55s]  That's the sellout move.
[2672.55s -> 2673.67s]  No, it's dodgy.
[2677.42s -> 2677.90s]  All right.
[2677.90s -> 2678.30s]  Come on.
[2678.30s -> 2678.70s]  Perfect.
[2682.84s -> 2683.24s]  Perfect.
[2683.72s -> 2686.65s]  It's like there's not enough of them
[2686.65s -> 2687.61s]  for me to get perfect.
[2687.61s -> 2688.57s]  It is on normal, though.
[2688.57s -> 2688.97s]  That's right.
[2689.85s -> 2690.97s]  Of course, another great point.
[2705.98s -> 2706.70s]  Or fewer.
[2709.53s -> 2713.85s]  Come on.
[2713.85s -> 2714.49s]  Give me perfect.
[2717.14s -> 2718.18s]  God, it's right there.
[2718.18s -> 2718.58s]  Come on.
[2726.07s -> 2747.58s]  Oh, you motherfucker.
[2747.58s -> 2748.46s]  Level up.
[2748.46s -> 2751.19s]  This is it.
[2751.19s -> 2751.59s]  Perfect.
[2751.59s -> 2752.31s]  Perfect.
[2752.31s -> 2760.18s]  Here we go.
[2760.18s -> 2761.22s]  Lots of fucking EXP.
[2771.45s -> 2772.01s]  Block it.
[2772.01s -> 2772.25s]  Good.
[2773.05s -> 2773.37s]  Nice.
[2774.65s -> 2774.97s]  All right.
[2774.97s -> 2775.37s]  We're good.
[2776.25s -> 2783.77s]  Just don't die.
[2784.33s -> 2784.89s]  Okay.
[2784.89s -> 2785.13s]  Please.
[2786.57s -> 2790.18s]  When I was a kid,
[2790.18s -> 2792.66s]  I used to think you could only use orc humor on orcs.
[2795.08s -> 2795.72s]  Well, I mean,
[2796.52s -> 2797.77s]  how old were you?
[2798.41s -> 2802.36s]  Were you over or under the age of 10?
[2802.36s -> 2807.83s]  I mean, that's not unreasonable.
[2808.31s -> 2818.76s]  I mean, can you,
[2818.76s -> 2821.56s]  either one of you two handle even one person?
[2822.52s -> 2825.24s]  You guys are worse than the last fucking co-op.
[2825.32s -> 2831.22s]  Is Legolas dead?
[2831.78s -> 2839.02s]  This game is awesome.
[2839.02s -> 2840.14s]  Yeah, they both really good.
[2840.78s -> 2850.81s]  The Lord of the Rings.
[2851.45s -> 2853.05s]  And the return of the king.
[2853.05s -> 2855.13s]  I keep looking over on the other monitor and just see that.
[2863.21s -> 2864.25s]  Oh, did you see that?
[2864.25s -> 2864.73s]  Oh, you didn't.
[2864.73s -> 2865.37s]  Did I block it?
[2877.45s -> 2890.38s]  Oh, it's just a cut scene.
[2890.38s -> 2892.30s]  Guys, don't DMCA this stream.
[2893.18s -> 2894.38s]  I didn't do anything.
[2895.10s -> 2904.09s]  How many purpose did I get?
[2904.09s -> 2904.57s]  Like five?
[2911.82s -> 2913.02s]  Mission rating.
[2913.02s -> 2913.34s]  Good.
[2920.73s -> 2921.13s]  All right.
[2922.18s -> 2922.82s]  Level three.
[2923.70s -> 2923.94s]  I...
[2926.07s -> 2926.47s]  Let's go.
[2927.11s -> 2928.07s]  I'll go over it all.
[2928.71s -> 2929.51s]  Final judgment.
[2932.92s -> 2934.04s]  I don't want to play as Gimli.
[2939.74s -> 2940.70s]  Rising of revenge.
[2944.62s -> 2946.62s]  You are Gimli main.
[2946.62s -> 2947.34s]  No, I'm not.
[2948.54s -> 2949.34s]  Strength of stone.
[2949.34s -> 2950.62s]  Permanently increases your health.
[2953.93s -> 2955.37s]  Lonely mountain lore.
[2956.09s -> 2959.72s]  Increase damage and get to perfect mode more quickly.
[2960.28s -> 2967.06s]  I'm doing health.
[2973.54s -> 2973.78s]  Okay.
[2977.66s -> 2978.78s]  Doing all...
[2978.78s -> 2979.98s]  I don't want to play as Gimli.
[2979.98s -> 2980.70s]  Gimli's not my main.
[2980.70s -> 2981.74s]  Did we get a T-pose right here?
[2982.62s -> 2984.41s]  I think we did for a second.
[2985.05s -> 2986.09s]  No, no, it was this.
[2986.09s -> 2986.41s]  Okay.
[2990.74s -> 2992.10s]  I never looked for that shit.
[2992.74s -> 2994.98s]  This is ever since I started streaming on Twitch.
[2996.17s -> 2996.97s]  I see them now.
[2997.77s -> 3002.31s]  I never even thought for a second.
[3002.31s -> 3005.85s]  But that was something to look for.
[3010.71s -> 3011.43s]  All right, let's go.
[3012.23s -> 3018.22s]  Who should put my points into?
[3018.86s -> 3021.43s]  Did you just say Gimli is your main?
[3021.43s -> 3023.43s]  I know, I said Gimli is not my main.
[3030.71s -> 3031.83s]  Game concept art.
[3031.83s -> 3032.63s]  Yeah, let's take a look.
[3034.23s -> 3037.61s]  We have to watch all of these.
[3037.61s -> 3040.36s]  No, hold on.
[3040.36s -> 3043.08s]  So this is the concept art for the game.
[3043.80s -> 3046.20s]  Not concept art for the movie.
[3046.20s -> 3047.08s]  Oh, that's bright.
[3047.64s -> 3052.82s]  Oh my god, this is horrible.
[3052.90s -> 3061.61s]  Something's wrong with the capture here.
[3062.49s -> 3064.17s]  It's really not right at all.
[3065.29s -> 3068.44s]  Fix the gamma.
[3068.44s -> 3069.00s]  No, it's...
[3069.00s -> 3069.80s]  Hold on a second.
[3069.80s -> 3070.20s]  I think it's...
[3071.48s -> 3072.36s]  Oh, oh, oh!
[3073.24s -> 3073.96s]  Whoa, hold on.
[3075.98s -> 3077.26s]  Something's not right here.
[3077.26s -> 3081.54s]  What's going on with this shit?
[3081.54s -> 3082.74s]  Why is it doing this?
[3082.74s -> 3086.09s]  All right, hold on.
[3086.09s -> 3087.21s]  I need to turn this off for a second.
[3092.57s -> 3093.45s]  This is fucked up.
[3094.01s -> 3097.54s]  I don't know what's going on.
[3098.18s -> 3105.30s]  Is that better?
[3106.10s -> 3111.19s]  By hell, let me go back in here now.
[3111.19s -> 3112.39s]  I don't know what's going on with this thing.
[3115.16s -> 3115.88s]  Did it make it worse?
[3116.68s -> 3124.50s]  The cables are bad?
[3124.50s -> 3125.70s]  How the fuck did that happen?
[3126.34s -> 3127.70s]  I've been gone for eight days.
[3127.70s -> 3129.30s]  What, did they rot while I was gone?
[3130.10s -> 3145.03s]  Hold on.
[3145.03s -> 3147.06s]  Is that better?
[3147.70s -> 3149.51s]  Maybe a little bit.
[3151.35s -> 3153.56s]  King of the Dead, the Southern Gate.
[3154.12s -> 3155.16s]  No, I gotta do all of them, right?
[3155.16s -> 3155.66s]  Yeah.
[3157.93s -> 3159.61s]  Road to Isengard.
[3160.41s -> 3162.30s]  Something's fucking wrong here.
[3163.10s -> 3164.22s]  Oh, I get to begin now.
[3164.78s -> 3165.18s]  That's like...
[3165.18s -> 3166.06s]  It looks a little better though.
[3168.71s -> 3171.99s]  So I took the cable and I bent it
[3171.99s -> 3173.75s]  and twisted it and pulled on it.
[3173.75s -> 3174.95s]  I'm not going to touch it anymore.
[3175.51s -> 3183.51s]  I'm being Gandalf.
[3194.89s -> 3196.41s]  Cable and ball torture.
[3196.97s -> 3201.53s]  It was not a chance that brought Maddie and Bippin to Fangorn.
[3201.53s -> 3206.79s]  Run, Mary!
[3206.79s -> 3207.91s]  It's talking, Mary.
[3207.91s -> 3209.35s]  The tree is talking.
[3209.35s -> 3209.85s]  Tree?
[3211.35s -> 3213.11s]  I am no tree.
[3214.07s -> 3215.83s]  I am an ant.
[3215.83s -> 3223.99s]  Inks have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards
[3225.03s -> 3226.87s]  for a very long time.
[3228.39s -> 3229.82s]  I love the word wizard.
[3231.10s -> 3231.90s]  Might be my favorite word.
[3246.81s -> 3248.81s]  This is pirate quality.
[3251.29s -> 3254.17s]  I really should just title this like Lord of the Rings.
[3254.17s -> 3258.01s]  Lord underscore of underscore the underscore rings underscore
[3258.73s -> 3264.33s]  like X2114 rip part one dot zip.
[3267.45s -> 3269.61s]  It does look like a torrented movie.
[3271.29s -> 3276.78s]  Actually does look better.
[3284.63s -> 3286.15s]  That guy got fucking disturbed.
[3286.15s -> 3288.39s]  That's being the first guy that runs alone to Gandalf
[3288.39s -> 3289.83s]  and be like, oh boy, you're done.
[3291.03s -> 3298.82s]  First to leave.
[3298.82s -> 3299.78s]  Yeah, what a...
[3299.78s -> 3300.82s]  I love the crisp loop.
[3305.96s -> 3307.00s]  That guy was running.
[3307.00s -> 3307.50s]  Smart.
[3308.28s -> 3311.43s]  Get that guy up there.
[3312.07s -> 3314.07s]  No, I just blew that guy's head off.
[3315.74s -> 3317.02s]  Gandalf, that was fucked up.
[3317.02s -> 3318.22s]  I'm trying to shoot the guy up here.
[3319.02s -> 3322.82s]  Let's just point blank that guy's head.
[3323.46s -> 3327.22s]  Hold on, can I?
[3327.22s -> 3327.86s]  Yes, I can.
[3329.34s -> 3330.14s]  Why would I even ask?
[3330.70s -> 3344.92s]  Here we go.
[3344.92s -> 3345.72s]  Let's get up here.
[3345.72s -> 3346.22s]  Come on.
[3348.41s -> 3349.45s]  Is that Gandalf?
[3352.15s -> 3354.23s]  I don't know why I thought that was Gandalf talking.
[3358.47s -> 3361.99s]  There he is.
[3364.79s -> 3366.79s]  Well, he's like, easy pickets back there.
[3366.79s -> 3367.29s]  Get him.
[3368.58s -> 3371.78s]  I was currently going and getting.
[3372.58s -> 3375.70s]  It sounded kind of like Gandalf.
[3383.34s -> 3389.02s]  And don't tell me I'm crazy because all video game voice acting is either we got the money to...
[3389.02s -> 3390.38s]  Ooh, hold on a second.
[3391.18s -> 3393.69s]  Come on, somebody.
[3394.57s -> 3395.53s]  I'm in perfect mode.
[3395.53s -> 3396.57s]  How dare you?
[3396.57s -> 3397.13s]  Come on.
[3397.13s -> 3397.53s]  No.
[3397.53s -> 3398.41s]  How dare you do this to me?
[3399.13s -> 3400.49s]  Fuck you.
[3401.05s -> 3404.30s]  Where am I?
[3404.30s -> 3410.66s]  What I was going to say is...
[3412.26s -> 3416.15s]  You either have the real actor there and you have the money for it or...
[3417.91s -> 3419.51s]  The guy from accounting does Gandalf.
[3420.39s -> 3429.90s]  He's gonna stomp.
[3430.62s -> 3433.48s]  All right, I need perfects here.
[3434.36s -> 3444.84s]  Get out of the way.
[3445.88s -> 3447.48s]  God, get the fuck out of here.
[3448.36s -> 3451.85s]  You guys are blocking the screen.
[3452.65s -> 3466.25s]  Gandalf's got a really good orc cure.
[3467.05s -> 3470.70s]  Come on.
[3470.70s -> 3471.74s]  Spring it, spring it, spring it.
[3472.76s -> 3473.26s]  Nothing.
[3473.80s -> 3486.25s]  Pick up.
[3488.31s -> 3490.54s]  No, get the fuck away from me.
[3490.54s -> 3490.94s]  I got this.
[3490.94s -> 3491.58s]  I got this.
[3491.58s -> 3492.08s]  Leave me alone.
[3492.86s -> 3503.26s]  Oh, come on.
[3503.26s -> 3504.70s]  Ooh, there it is again.
[3504.70s -> 3506.38s]  Thanks for stepping on me over and over again.
[3507.18s -> 3512.36s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[3512.36s -> 3519.78s]  Before they destroy all...
[3519.78s -> 3525.48s]  Come on, come on.
[3525.48s -> 3529.62s]  Let's go, come on.
[3530.26s -> 3530.76s]  Get this out.
[3531.30s -> 3540.02s]  Who the fuck are you aiming?
[3547.08s -> 3548.12s]  Star Wars wizard.
[3551.70s -> 3553.62s]  Is there any game that you can use?
[3553.62s -> 3554.12s]  Hold on.
[3555.38s -> 3560.25s]  I have to just get that nice and clean.
[3560.89s -> 3565.03s]  Should I play Jedi Fallen Order?
[3565.85s -> 3567.29s]  Somebody please tell me the truth.
[3568.42s -> 3571.46s]  I love lightsabers and I love Dark Souls games.
[3571.46s -> 3574.10s]  Like, how would I not like that game?
[3574.10s -> 3576.18s]  Is it really bad enough where you're like,
[3576.18s -> 3576.98s]  no, no, no, no.
[3576.98s -> 3577.62s]  It's like, suck.
[3578.90s -> 3580.34s]  That ticks every box for me.
[3593.16s -> 3594.12s]  Fallen Order is good.
[3594.12s -> 3595.00s]  One person just said it.
[3595.00s -> 3596.28s]  Did I believe them?
[3596.28s -> 3597.85s]  Wait a minute.
[3598.47s -> 3599.61s]  Did I believe that person?
[3606.71s -> 3607.75s]  Believe that person.
[3607.75s -> 3608.25s]  Okay.
[3608.71s -> 3609.51s]  Fuck that guy.
[3609.51s -> 3610.01s]  Don't...
[3610.01s -> 3610.31s]  Hey, come on.
[3611.43s -> 3613.45s]  You guys are sitting on the same train here.
[3619.99s -> 3621.19s]  You're not sitting on the subway
[3621.19s -> 3623.19s]  and somebody gets off at one at a stop
[3623.19s -> 3624.47s]  and you go, oh, fuck that stop.
[3624.47s -> 3625.11s]  Fuck that guy.
[3627.35s -> 3628.23s]  We're on the same train.
[3639.56s -> 3640.12s]  Shit, I didn't see...
[3640.12s -> 3641.32s]  This guy, this guy's like popped in.
[3642.60s -> 3650.15s]  Sitting on the scam train.
[3650.15s -> 3656.47s]  What the hell?
[3656.47s -> 3656.95s]  Is that health?
[3660.34s -> 3661.06s]  Ooh, come on.
[3663.16s -> 3663.80s]  Come on.
[3663.80s -> 3666.94s]  Oh, just excellent.
[3666.94s -> 3668.70s]  I might as well not even fucking try then.
[3669.58s -> 3672.25s]  Not even worth tweeting about.
[3675.59s -> 3676.07s]  Really?
[3676.07s -> 3678.98s]  Like, what the fuck?
[3678.98s -> 3679.86s]  Why am I supposed to go?
[3680.66s -> 3691.02s]  No, it's gonna do the camera change.
[3691.02s -> 3691.52s]  Bullshit.
[3693.11s -> 3695.48s]  All right, got it.
[3695.48s -> 3696.76s]  I'm actually playing pretty well.
[3696.76s -> 3698.12s]  Remember last time I played this game?
[3704.52s -> 3705.80s]  Like the multivitamins working.
[3706.36s -> 3710.98s]  I started taking like a little
[3711.86s -> 3713.14s]  volti vitamin recently
[3713.14s -> 3714.50s]  and I think it's working.
[3723.42s -> 3724.86s]  Voldemort gummies.
[3725.82s -> 3727.99s]  That's never getting sent.
[3728.71s -> 3737.75s]  I'll take a perfect.
[3738.31s -> 3739.27s]  I'll take a perfect.
[3739.27s -> 3739.77s]  I'll take a...
[3745.14s -> 3745.64s]  Will you?
[3748.89s -> 3750.09s]  Will you do that, Gandalf?
[3751.75s -> 3753.03s]  Gandalf, is that what you're doing?
[3753.83s -> 3763.11s]  Gandalf, is that what we're doing here?
[3763.11s -> 3763.75s]  I don't know.
[3763.75s -> 3764.87s]  I don't think that's what we're doing here.
[3765.67s -> 3768.63s]  I thought that just said overachiever on it.
[3768.63s -> 3770.71s]  I was like, why are you calling me an overachiever?
[3772.78s -> 3773.34s]  I don't...
[3773.34s -> 3774.86s]  What, I put the end out?
[3774.86s -> 3775.90s]  How do I save him?
[3775.90s -> 3776.54s]  I don't know what to do.
[3778.31s -> 3778.95s]  I can't hit it.
[3779.59s -> 3780.95s]  Oh, I just have to protect him.
[3789.11s -> 3791.75s]  I didn't even see the archers on my cell phone camera.
[3791.75s -> 3792.25s]  Sorry.
[3792.95s -> 3805.30s]  Gandalf, best character, seriously.
[3805.30s -> 3806.58s]  Why would I ever play another character?
[3807.30s -> 3819.51s]  Anybody else?
[3819.51s -> 3819.83s]  Take it.
[3819.83s -> 3820.33s]  Come on, go.
[3825.22s -> 3825.78s]  Sam.
[3825.78s -> 3826.26s]  Sam.
[3826.34s -> 3826.84s]  Sam.
[3827.46s -> 3830.82s]  But why would I want to play Sam when I can play as Gandalf?
[3838.06s -> 3838.86s]  Sam gang.
[3838.86s -> 3839.50s]  Sam gang.
[3839.50s -> 3840.14s]  Sam gang.
[3840.14s -> 3840.64s]  Sam gang.
[3841.66s -> 3842.78s]  All right, I will play as Sam.
[3842.78s -> 3843.28s]  I will.
[3844.06s -> 3850.81s]  Did you get it?
[3858.28s -> 3859.56s]  Okay, I don't know what's going on.
[3860.52s -> 3863.32s]  I just started laughing about the cow throwing the rock.
[3863.32s -> 3865.32s]  And black and white.
[3865.32s -> 3866.44s]  It's happening a lot.
[3867.56s -> 3869.24s]  I'll be out to dinner with Kim.
[3869.24s -> 3870.04s]  And I'll just think of...
[3871.40s -> 3872.92s]  And then the rock getting thrown.
[3872.92s -> 3875.16s]  And I don't know why.
[3875.16s -> 3876.36s]  It's fucking crazy.
[3897.91s -> 3898.39s]  Do not...
[3898.39s -> 3898.95s]  Wait a minute.
[3898.95s -> 3899.51s]  What's this?
[3899.51s -> 3900.71s]  We have an important message here.
[3901.43s -> 3902.73s]  Let me see what this is.
[3903.53s -> 3909.50s]  Hey everyone, fucking listen.
[3909.50s -> 3913.98s]  For the love of God, do not buy the $5 Biggie bag from Wendy's.
[3913.98s -> 3917.26s]  If you purchase the standard 4th floor and add bacon, it comes to $4.50.
[3917.26s -> 3918.06s]  They're scamming you.
[3918.06s -> 3921.02s]  Instead, upgrade your fries to a large and your total will be $5.
[3922.22s -> 3924.46s]  I don't even know what that means.
[3924.46s -> 3927.42s]  I have not been to Wendy's in probably like six months.
[3936.95s -> 3937.99s]  I'm a McDonald's guy.
[3938.71s -> 3939.91s]  You guys know that.
[3942.28s -> 3943.96s]  I'm a McDonald's guy.
[3943.96s -> 3953.27s]  If I had fast food, me and Kim.
[3953.27s -> 3954.07s]  Kim is the same way.
[3954.07s -> 3955.11s]  Kim's a McDonald's girl.
[3955.11s -> 3955.99s]  I'm a McDonald's guy.
[3958.44s -> 3958.92s]  Number one.
[3960.06s -> 3960.70s]  I'm sorry.
[3960.70s -> 3961.98s]  That's just the way it is.
[3962.78s -> 3969.91s]  McDonald's is dog food.
[3969.91s -> 3970.47s]  No, it's not.
[3970.47s -> 3971.35s]  It's great.
[3971.35s -> 3972.95s]  It's good.
[3972.95s -> 3974.95s]  McChicken is fucking perfect.
[3974.95s -> 3975.99s]  Number one is really good.
[3976.63s -> 3977.51s]  McDonald's is...
[3977.51s -> 3978.47s]  I like McDonald's.
[3979.35s -> 3980.39s]  I think when...
[3980.39s -> 3981.91s]  It's more comfortable for me to eat at McDonald's.
[3981.91s -> 3985.27s]  Wendy's might be higher quality food, but I like McDonald's better.
[3985.27s -> 3985.67s]  I don't care.
[3988.22s -> 3988.70s]  I like it.
[3995.35s -> 3996.63s]  How much did they pay you?
[3996.63s -> 3999.51s]  If you really think that McDonald's needs to pay somebody
[4000.58s -> 4002.74s]  to talk about how they like the Big Mac.
[4003.46s -> 4008.50s]  I mean, there's like 16,000 McDonald's stores.
[4008.50s -> 4009.86s]  They're doing just fine.
[4010.58s -> 4014.04s]  They don't need my help.
[4014.04s -> 4019.18s]  A McDonald's hamburger is sold every tenth of a second in this country.
[4019.18s -> 4020.14s]  They don't need my help.
[4020.14s -> 4021.42s]  They don't need to pay me for that.
[4022.06s -> 4025.35s]  The people are going to eat there.
[4025.35s -> 4026.07s]  All right, what should we do?
[4026.07s -> 4035.64s]  Final judgment.
[4035.64s -> 4037.00s]  It's garbage food.
[4037.00s -> 4038.28s]  You're killing yourself.
[4040.98s -> 4047.13s]  Do you have you ever listened to Benjamin Franklin's podcast?
[4047.13s -> 4048.65s]  All things in moderation.
[4048.65s -> 4053.16s]  He would have had a great podcast, don't you think?
[4055.02s -> 4057.58s]  I think Ben Franklin would have been the Joe Rogan.
[4057.58s -> 4059.13s]  Don't you think so?
[4059.13s -> 4061.85s]  He would have like the microphone set up.
[4061.85s -> 4069.37s]  He'd be bringing in people.
[4069.37s -> 4071.61s]  Okay, let me buy something.
[4071.61s -> 4080.81s]  I need to get this.
[4080.81s -> 4082.49s]  I feel like I'm wasting money.
[4083.29s -> 4084.81s]  Should I upgrade Gandalf?
[4084.81s -> 4085.31s]  This is...
[4086.09s -> 4088.34s]  Just do it for everybody.
[4088.34s -> 4088.84s]  X.
[4089.22s -> 4095.91s]  The dude came up with electricity.
[4098.81s -> 4100.01s]  I know what Tesla said.
[4100.97s -> 4103.37s]  Benjamin Franklin got struck by lightning first.
[4103.37s -> 4104.01s]  And he lived.
[4105.03s -> 4106.55s]  At least that's what the cartoon told me.
[4111.26s -> 4115.16s]  I'm going to get this because this is very important for everyone to have this.
[4115.16s -> 4116.60s]  It's incredibly important.
[4116.60s -> 4123.70s]  And do I have enough?
[4123.70s -> 4124.66s]  I have enough to give it to everybody.
[4124.66s -> 4125.54s]  Just give it to everybody.
[4125.54s -> 4126.50s]  I'm spreading it all around.
[4134.71s -> 4135.59s]  This looks good.
[4135.59s -> 4139.78s]  It's like a knockdown.
[4141.30s -> 4142.25s]  I'll do the kill.
[4144.62s -> 4146.06s]  X circle R2.
[4146.06s -> 4146.70s]  All right, that's good.
[4163.24s -> 4166.36s]  You sound like you're reading a menu at a restaurant.
[4167.88s -> 4169.88s]  We're picking skills?
[4171.24s -> 4179.24s]  Now, I know exactly what I want.
[4180.74s -> 4187.10s]  See, I pre-order at every restaurant I go to.
[4187.10s -> 4192.47s]  What that means is every restaurant has their menus online now.
[4192.47s -> 4194.17s]  I go find out what I want.
[4194.81s -> 4196.41s]  I know what I want when I get in.
[4196.41s -> 4197.53s]  I don't have to ask any questions.
[4201.59s -> 4204.71s]  So then it's not a question of sitting there for 20 minutes
[4204.71s -> 4206.31s]  while I try to figure out what the hell you want to eat.
[4207.03s -> 4209.05s]  I kind of have to watch this, don't I?
[4209.69s -> 4213.43s]  The world is changing.
[4213.43s -> 4221.99s]  Stand against the armies of Isegard Mordor.
[4221.99s -> 4229.24s]  What I'm doing today is I've been providing the voice of Saruman in the game.
[4229.24s -> 4230.84s]  I told you the power of stone.
[4230.84s -> 4233.80s]  Saruman the White was the head of the Order.
[4233.80s -> 4237.24s]  And he thinks that he can be the Lord of the Rings.
[4237.24s -> 4239.56s]  We must join with Saruman.
[4239.56s -> 4241.80s]  Power of Saruman lies in his voice.
[4241.80s -> 4243.00s]  Absolutely legendary.
[4243.00s -> 4245.16s]  Now we can attend with the will of Saruman.
[4245.16s -> 4248.12s]  He's not just a wizard who can do extraordinary things.
[4248.12s -> 4251.40s]  He can convince most unlikely people.
[4251.40s -> 4253.48s]  This is the impression, you see, that he gives.
[4254.28s -> 4255.72s]  All powerful.
[4256.76s -> 4257.56s]  What a professional.
[4257.56s -> 4259.40s]  What an absolute professional.
[4260.44s -> 4262.60s]  If you do the right things, you will beat me.
[4262.60s -> 4265.16s]  If you do the wrong things, you will lose.
[4270.92s -> 4272.28s]  Is Viggo Mortensen in this game?
[4273.56s -> 4274.28s]  I hope so.
[4275.16s -> 4276.98s]  All right, we can go to the King of the Dead.
[4277.62s -> 4278.49s]  No, we don't.
[4278.49s -> 4279.21s]  We have to do...
[4279.21s -> 4279.77s]  Wait, didn't we?
[4281.43s -> 4282.39s]  Yeah, we're going to go up.
[4282.39s -> 4283.67s]  Escape from Ozgaloth.
[4283.67s -> 4284.39s]  You know, we can do it all.
[4284.39s -> 4285.27s]  Whatever, we're doing it all.
[4286.23s -> 4297.91s]  That was violent for Sam.
[4299.91s -> 4301.59s]  Isn't Sam a chef?
[4301.59s -> 4303.27s]  Well, I guess you know how to cut stuff.
[4303.75s -> 4312.98s]  It's filled with both great hope and the success of our plan.
[4312.98s -> 4317.24s]  I must place the smallest of us in the greatest of peril.
[4317.24s -> 4323.69s]  Always the mighty tried to possess the ring and always they failed.
[4327.45s -> 4334.38s]  Fate has lent me a hobby, resilient to the ring's corruption and brave by his very nature.
[4335.02s -> 4337.32s]  I want to watch these movies.
[4337.32s -> 4338.68s]  You cannot stay in the Shire.
[4338.68s -> 4339.32s]  No.
[4339.32s -> 4341.00s]  Elijah Wood's awesome, too.
[4341.00s -> 4343.48s]  This is just an all-awesome cast.
[4343.48s -> 4344.92s]  Everybody is so good.
[4345.40s -> 4348.01s]  Start hard to bear the ring.
[4348.01s -> 4361.46s]  You will need paths into Mordor.
[4361.46s -> 4366.52s]  For all three of them are bound to the fate of the ring and to the fate of each other.
[4367.32s -> 4368.28s]  All right, I'm going to...
[4368.28s -> 4369.48s]  How many people are in this community?
[4370.52s -> 4372.55s]  Like a few hundred thousand.
[4374.86s -> 4378.06s]  I'll rent out a football stadium and we'll just put it on a big screen
[4378.06s -> 4379.02s]  and everyone's invited.
[4379.02s -> 4379.50s]  We'll do that.
[4379.50s -> 4382.01s]  What do you want this way?
[4382.01s -> 4386.74s]  You know the way to order.
[4386.74s -> 4387.86s]  Imagine.
[4387.86s -> 4395.26s]  Oh, that was like 40 million dollars to get the licensing to do that.
[4395.26s -> 4396.70s]  Into the very fires of Mordor.
[4396.70s -> 4399.34s]  Watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a stadium.
[4399.34s -> 4406.76s]  And they'll be captured and all hope may be lost.
[4406.76s -> 4407.72s]  I hire a...
[4409.72s -> 4415.27s]  Like a LARPing crew to do every scene on the football field while the movie is playing.
[4415.99s -> 4417.27s]  So you get two at the same time.
[4431.82s -> 4432.54s]  Make it happen.
[4432.54s -> 4435.18s]  Anybody have a hundred million dollars that they don't need anymore?
[4435.18s -> 4436.70s]  That they'd like to just have disappear?
[4447.45s -> 4449.66s]  All right, let's go.
[4450.30s -> 4454.94s]  All right, I'm just slashing at random people.
[4455.74s -> 4459.26s]  Are we supposed to be following you?
[4460.90s -> 4461.46s]  Can you block?
[4463.16s -> 4466.28s]  By the way, all you guys that said like minus two.
[4467.24s -> 4477.08s]  He's doing it.
[4479.02s -> 4479.82s]  That is the...
[4479.82s -> 4482.06s]  Oh, button for him.
[4482.78s -> 4496.01s]  Does he have Orcure?
[4496.65s -> 4498.70s]  Can he even have Orcure?
[4499.50s -> 4503.85s]  What is it?
[4503.85s -> 4504.25s]  It's a...
[4505.05s -> 4510.79s]  It's what?
[4510.79s -> 4511.03s]  X...
[4511.59s -> 4512.31s]  He has it, right?
[4512.31s -> 4512.71s]  Doesn't he?
[4513.75s -> 4513.99s]  It's...
[4515.75s -> 4517.43s]  It's X circle...
[4517.43s -> 4518.39s]  X circle R2.
[4519.86s -> 4520.90s]  X circle R2?
[4521.78s -> 4526.95s]  Oh, he's level one.
[4526.95s -> 4528.15s]  He can't do it.
[4528.15s -> 4528.95s]  Oh, all right.
[4529.83s -> 4535.18s]  Why can't we...
[4535.18s -> 4535.42s]  Okay.
[4536.14s -> 4537.64s]  Can we not trade swords?
[4540.73s -> 4541.85s]  Like this is just the...
[4541.85s -> 4543.13s]  You don't want to take it from your friend.
[4543.69s -> 4545.53s]  But if your friend has the legendary,
[4545.53s -> 4548.25s]  don't you think you should put it in the hands of the person that knows how to attack?
[4549.05s -> 4551.35s]  It's kind of...
[4551.35s -> 4552.71s]  It's useless in your hands right now.
[4560.04s -> 4560.84s]  It's soul bound.
[4561.64s -> 4563.32s]  Yeah, well, you shouldn't press need on it,
[4563.32s -> 4564.92s]  but I'm not going to give you shit for it.
[4564.92s -> 4565.32s]  Every time...
[4565.32s -> 4567.32s]  We can't talk about World of Warcraft
[4567.32s -> 4569.88s]  every single time we play a game with swords in it.
[4569.88s -> 4570.52s]  All right?
[4570.52s -> 4571.80s]  I'm not going to talk about it anymore.
[4586.30s -> 4587.26s]  I didn't even have to do anything.
[4588.65s -> 4588.97s]  How?
[4598.60s -> 4599.24s]  Oh, that was...
[4599.24s -> 4600.76s]  We just both hit each other at the same time.
[4605.48s -> 4606.60s]  Sam is the best character?
[4606.60s -> 4607.00s]  We'll see.
[4607.88s -> 4608.28s]  We'll see.
[4609.00s -> 4612.10s]  I'm not sure if I agree with that statement, but...
[4613.42s -> 4616.46s]  I mean, he did win the Academy Awards, so you're kind of right.
[4631.54s -> 4632.66s]  Actual Academy Award.
[4633.22s -> 4634.82s]  Dude, it was him.
[4634.82s -> 4635.22s]  You got it.
[4635.94s -> 4646.02s]  I didn't even notice the dragon.
[4646.02s -> 4648.58s]  Well, I did before, but, you know, I didn't know the dragon was still here.
[4648.58s -> 4649.54s]  Does this happen in the movie?
[4653.62s -> 4654.50s]  Perfect, perfect, perfect.
[4654.50s -> 4655.70s]  Come on, let's get Sam some perfects.
[4655.70s -> 4656.50s]  I need the XP.
[4657.30s -> 4669.75s]  This was cut from the movie.
[4670.39s -> 4679.56s]  That was a cool move.
[4681.14s -> 4681.62s]  Fire it!
[4685.11s -> 4686.15s]  He does have the orcure.
[4690.71s -> 4691.51s]  I don't like Sam...
[4691.51s -> 4692.71s]  I don't like Sam's orcure.
[4692.71s -> 4693.43s]  It's too fancy.
[4695.24s -> 4695.96s]  I don't like that.
[4695.96s -> 4697.00s]  It takes him too long to do it.
[4698.09s -> 4699.37s]  I'm not playing with him.
[4699.37s -> 4699.87s]  I don't care.
[4700.67s -> 4701.71s]  I'm playing with Gandalf.
[4701.71s -> 4702.21s]  Fuck it.
[4713.77s -> 4714.33s]  I'm leaving?
[4715.95s -> 4716.27s]  Really?
[4717.15s -> 4719.29s]  I can't even see who's shooting.
[4723.40s -> 4725.16s]  Gandalf hits twice with his orcure.
[4725.16s -> 4727.08s]  He spins around and swings once.
[4727.08s -> 4728.24s]  It's not very good.
[4737.37s -> 4739.37s]  Why are the hobbits as tall as the orcs?
[4739.93s -> 4744.43s]  Looks like we're going up the ladder to the cleric beast.
[4744.43s -> 4746.83s]  I'll take that one because that's an actual good reference.
[4746.83s -> 4747.87s]  I don't care what anybody says.
[4747.87s -> 4749.71s]  That was a great fucking reference.
[4749.71s -> 4751.55s]  One of the best I've made in probably the last few months.
[4755.31s -> 4755.81s]  I don't care.
[4769.16s -> 4770.12s]  You've ruined it.
[4770.36s -> 4770.76s]  I know.
[4771.48s -> 4772.68s]  That's the kind of...
[4772.68s -> 4773.72s]  Wasn't that kind of the point?
[4782.81s -> 4783.29s]  What?
[4783.29s -> 4784.17s]  What just happened?
[4784.73s -> 4786.84s]  What's the timer?
[4787.64s -> 4793.53s]  Oh, the dragon comes back.
[4793.53s -> 4793.93s]  I see.
[4794.73s -> 4795.53s]  Okay.
[4795.53s -> 4802.09s]  If it was a plus two, then you acknowledged it and turned it into a minus four.
[4803.96s -> 4806.84s]  Well, we'll see what the other judges have to say at the end of the boxing match.
[4807.56s -> 4812.08s]  I want the help.
[4816.35s -> 4818.59s]  There's always that one judge that's a real asshole.
[4819.31s -> 4832.89s]  Aragon is getting his ass kicked.
[4832.89s -> 4844.03s]  German, we all did minus two.
[4846.14s -> 4846.70s]  Yeah, but you're...
[4847.34s -> 4848.38s]  There's two other judges.
[4849.18s -> 4851.96s]  My mother watches these streams.
[4851.96s -> 4852.84s]  I'll text her later.
[4853.48s -> 4855.80s]  What do you think about that thing I said about the Clarities?
[4856.52s -> 4857.96s]  Honey, it was so good.
[4858.76s -> 4860.92s]  It's always a plus two from mom, by the way.
[4860.92s -> 4861.64s]  So, sorry.
[4862.36s -> 4873.10s]  Let me get some perfects.
[4873.10s -> 4877.29s]  Bring the bell.
[4882.27s -> 4892.62s]  Oh, is it again?
[4893.18s -> 4895.29s]  How many bells can I throw down there?
[4895.29s -> 4912.14s]  I have to help Aragon.
[4912.14s -> 4913.50s]  Is that even Aragon or am I...
[4913.50s -> 4914.22s]  Do I have this wrong?
[4914.22s -> 4914.62s]  No, wait.
[4914.62s -> 4915.50s]  Is that Aragon?
[4915.50s -> 4915.90s]  Hold on.
[4916.78s -> 4918.84s]  Why are there two Aragons?
[4919.48s -> 4938.43s]  You're a fake fan?
[4938.43s -> 4939.79s]  No, this is the same person.
[4940.59s -> 4949.50s]  That's the same character model.
[4950.14s -> 4961.64s]  Oh, look.
[4961.64s -> 4963.08s]  There's Aragon again.
[4963.08s -> 4968.27s]  Is that just like the default like human model?
[4968.27s -> 4969.23s]  It looks like Aragon.
[4973.39s -> 4974.67s]  That's a broken back.
[4976.33s -> 4977.37s]  Holy shit.
[4978.17s -> 4982.22s]  I hope you got the...
[4982.22s -> 4983.66s]  I hope you land the arrow.
[4984.46s -> 4991.12s]  All right, are we good?
[5001.15s -> 5001.95s]  Dragon's coming back.
[5002.59s -> 5013.50s]  I gotta go.
[5013.50s -> 5015.29s]  Where is he?
[5015.29s -> 5015.77s]  Oh, God.
[5015.77s -> 5016.33s]  He's coming back.
[5016.89s -> 5023.79s]  Is Frodo gonna kill the dragon?
[5023.79s -> 5036.81s]  You can't be up to...
[5036.81s -> 5037.37s]  Okay, right.
[5037.37s -> 5039.93s]  You can't be up top when the timer reaches zero.
[5047.80s -> 5048.84s]  That's not that far back, right?
[5049.40s -> 5056.01s]  It's actually pretty far back.
[5056.01s -> 5057.77s]  All right.
[5057.77s -> 5059.37s]  Well, now I just get out of the way.
[5066.94s -> 5072.70s]  It takes you too long.
[5072.70s -> 5073.42s]  It takes too long.
[5073.42s -> 5073.90s]  I'm just gonna...
[5073.90s -> 5075.02s]  I'm just gonna default swing.
[5075.74s -> 5076.56s]  It takes too long.
[5077.12s -> 5079.52s]  Unless I get to perfect, which I might.
[5080.24s -> 5091.58s]  All right, let's go.
[5095.80s -> 5097.39s]  All right, he's back.
[5097.39s -> 5097.71s]  He's back.
[5097.71s -> 5098.83s]  I gotta get out of here.
[5098.83s -> 5100.72s]  We go down.
[5101.36s -> 5102.70s]  Does this count as hiding?
[5103.34s -> 5108.94s]  I feel like he came over here before.
[5114.88s -> 5115.20s]  Right.
[5115.20s -> 5116.08s]  So if I'm over here...
[5116.08s -> 5116.56s]  So he's gone.
[5116.56s -> 5116.80s]  Okay.
[5117.36s -> 5119.37s]  All right.
[5119.37s -> 5120.25s]  For the love of God.
[5121.61s -> 5123.61s]  Gollum, can you fucking bite somebody's leg?
[5124.41s -> 5136.94s]  Stab him.
[5136.94s -> 5143.10s]  I'm trying.
[5143.66s -> 5145.02s]  There's health back here though.
[5145.02s -> 5145.58s]  All right, let's go.
[5147.92s -> 5149.68s]  Not this insanity again.
[5149.68s -> 5150.88s]  No, this is not gonna be insane.
[5152.25s -> 5152.89s]  No.
[5152.89s -> 5153.85s]  It's not gonna be insane.
[5154.49s -> 5157.96s]  I have confidence that I'll get...
[5157.96s -> 5158.36s]  I will get...
[5159.08s -> 5160.60s]  This will be a normal stream.
[5163.23s -> 5163.63s]  Normal.
[5164.27s -> 5170.06s]  My mother's watching.
[5170.06s -> 5172.16s]  This is her favorite movie ever.
[5174.01s -> 5174.89s]  You saw the notifications.
[5174.89s -> 5175.53s]  She texted me.
[5175.53s -> 5176.73s]  She's like, wait, hold on.
[5176.73s -> 5177.45s]  The movie?
[5178.33s -> 5178.65s]  Yeah.
[5178.65s -> 5180.09s]  She's like, my favorite movie?
[5181.13s -> 5181.69s]  Yes, mom.
[5184.38s -> 5185.74s]  I have to be on my best behavior.
[5186.30s -> 5198.91s]  Yeah, you guys...
[5198.91s -> 5199.31s]  You too.
[5199.95s -> 5205.50s]  You know she can read the chat.
[5206.06s -> 5212.28s]  Is there health over here?
[5214.81s -> 5215.45s]  Yes, there is.
[5216.25s -> 5218.76s]  When's the next crack stream?
[5220.43s -> 5220.75s]  I don't know.
[5220.75s -> 5221.55s]  You tell me.
[5221.55s -> 5223.95s]  When do you guys think you're gonna smoke your next crack?
[5224.51s -> 5224.99s]  I don't know.
[5224.99s -> 5225.87s]  I can't tell you that.
[5226.43s -> 5241.52s]  The game definitely looks better too.
[5241.52s -> 5241.84s]  I don't know.
[5241.84s -> 5244.48s]  I grabbed the cables and shook them so it worked.
[5245.04s -> 5245.68s]  All right, we gotta go.
[5247.42s -> 5247.82s]  Let's go.
[5248.62s -> 5249.76s]  Forget about it.
[5249.76s -> 5250.16s]  Just move.
[5251.82s -> 5252.70s]  I can't walk that way.
[5253.42s -> 5264.81s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[5265.45s -> 5265.77s]  Move.
[5268.97s -> 5269.29s]  Move.
[5270.73s -> 5271.21s]  Well, I'm...
[5273.71s -> 5274.03s]  Go.
[5274.75s -> 5277.52s]  Go in, go in, go in, go in.
[5278.24s -> 5280.38s]  All right, we're outside.
[5281.02s -> 5284.91s]  Derma's dev is in chat.
[5285.55s -> 5286.62s]  That's clever.
[5287.50s -> 5288.70s]  That's pretty clever.
[5288.70s -> 5294.56s]  Let's go.
[5294.56s -> 5300.92s]  Three hits.
[5300.92s -> 5301.48s]  Does it kill?
[5302.04s -> 5306.36s]  Kind of.
[5306.36s -> 5307.72s]  All right, are we safe over here?
[5307.72s -> 5308.12s]  No, we're not.
[5308.12s -> 5308.44s]  Just go.
[5308.44s -> 5309.40s]  Just go to the next building.
[5310.12s -> 5314.38s]  Did you actually hit me?
[5314.38s -> 5315.98s]  I was ripping back and forth.
[5322.67s -> 5322.91s]  Wait.
[5326.48s -> 5326.72s]  You have...
[5326.72s -> 5328.08s]  Derma, you have a lot of moms.
[5328.72s -> 5331.04s]  There's only one mom.
[5331.84s -> 5332.80s]  And it's my mom.
[5333.44s -> 5333.92s]  And that's it.
[5334.64s -> 5337.18s]  Is there a ladder?
[5337.74s -> 5340.52s]  Where's the ladder?
[5340.52s -> 5344.60s]  Anybody see a ladder?
[5344.60s -> 5345.48s]  Can you say go down?
[5346.20s -> 5351.93s]  There it is.
[5351.93s -> 5352.89s]  You can play as Gollum.
[5352.89s -> 5353.85s]  That'd be awesome if you could.
[5355.92s -> 5356.80s]  Just keep moving.
[5364.91s -> 5365.71s]  Gollum gang.
[5366.59s -> 5368.99s]  I need health.
[5369.71s -> 5370.11s]  Otherwise...
[5370.75s -> 5372.03s]  Not what a good place I want to be.
[5372.03s -> 5374.03s]  I don't have a checkpoint so I can't focus up.
[5374.03s -> 5375.15s]  I'm gonna really focus here.
[5376.11s -> 5379.53s]  Okay.
[5380.33s -> 5383.68s]  I'm master.
[5383.76s -> 5384.64s]  I can do it.
[5384.64s -> 5386.24s]  I'm pretty good at that one.
[5397.16s -> 5398.28s]  It's real voice.
[5404.73s -> 5406.01s]  Derma, are you available?
[5406.57s -> 5407.21s]  Of course.
[5407.21s -> 5407.85s]  I'm available.
[5418.22s -> 5424.44s]  Really?
[5424.44s -> 5425.72s]  Block, block, block, block, block, block.
[5425.72s -> 5426.36s]  Swing.
[5426.36s -> 5429.13s]  Meet's back on the menu.
[5435.10s -> 5436.06s]  Ooh, full health.
[5436.06s -> 5436.30s]  Yes.
[5436.94s -> 5440.22s]  All right, we got a big guy coming.
[5444.32s -> 5445.20s]  What the fuck is this?
[5445.84s -> 5450.65s]  Come on, bring it on.
[5451.21s -> 5452.24s]  How many do we have?
[5453.71s -> 5454.99s]  Ooh, that hurt a lot.
[5461.16s -> 5462.38s]  All right, kill these guys first.
[5466.17s -> 5467.77s]  Don't knock me into the fucking...
[5467.77s -> 5469.45s]  God damn it, it happened.
[5469.45s -> 5470.49s]  I took them both.
[5471.21s -> 5475.34s]  I got him in the back, I think.
[5479.05s -> 5479.77s]  Holy shit.
[5480.65s -> 5480.97s]  All right.
[5481.92s -> 5482.48s]  No.
[5482.48s -> 5483.12s]  I can't even hurt him.
[5483.68s -> 5488.49s]  What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[5489.60s -> 5490.24s]  Heavy attacks.
[5491.04s -> 5492.08s]  Why did I have to...
[5492.08s -> 5493.28s]  I'm so fucking mad.
[5493.28s -> 5495.04s]  Why did I have to get knocked into the two healths?
[5495.68s -> 5496.56s]  It's two full...
[5496.56s -> 5498.24s]  And I'm all the way back at the beginning.
[5498.24s -> 5503.69s]  Was there a checkpoint at the bottom of the sewer?
[5503.69s -> 5508.30s]  Please tell me there was.
[5508.30s -> 5509.50s]  Oh, fuck me.
[5510.46s -> 5513.07s]  I'm just running.
[5513.63s -> 5517.84s]  This course is two healths and I'm just trying to...
[5517.84s -> 5518.96s]  This three guys stand...
[5518.96s -> 5519.76s]  I'm just running, I don't care.
[5520.40s -> 5522.08s]  I don't care if I get a zero.
[5522.72s -> 5533.36s]  I have to kill like a few people.
[5533.36s -> 5534.24s]  Fuck, why?
[5535.04s -> 5536.16s]  This mission sucks.
[5536.88s -> 5539.90s]  It's because I'm playing as Sam.
[5540.54s -> 5542.62s]  I could be playing as the most powerful wizard
[5543.26s -> 5544.22s]  in the universe.
[5545.02s -> 5547.02s]  But I'm going to be the guy who eats potatoes.
[5574.59s -> 5577.79s]  Remember when Gandalf went through Osgiloth?
[5577.79s -> 5590.51s]  I gotta get experience points for Sam.
[5591.15s -> 5593.69s]  You're being a Sam hater.
[5599.63s -> 5601.42s]  Well, that's okay.
[5601.98s -> 5606.56s]  What are my thoughts on the Hobbit movies?
[5608.94s -> 5609.98s]  People hate those movies.
[5609.98s -> 5610.78s]  I thought they were fine.
[5611.42s -> 5612.97s]  I mean, they stretched...
[5614.01s -> 5618.57s]  They stretched a book as big as a Goosebumps book
[5619.21s -> 5621.29s]  into three, four-hour long movies.
[5621.29s -> 5622.97s]  So that was probably a mistake.
[5622.97s -> 5630.24s]  But whatever.
[5630.24s -> 5632.00s]  I think that they're still enjoyable.
[5632.80s -> 5635.12s]  I like Smog.
[5635.12s -> 5635.92s]  I think he's good.
[5636.88s -> 5638.96s]  They're a little long, a little dragged out.
[5640.92s -> 5642.12s]  I could still enjoy them.
[5643.60s -> 5644.48s]  Do I love them?
[5644.48s -> 5644.98s]  No.
[5646.04s -> 5648.52s]  Would I choose to watch the Hobbit movies?
[5648.52s -> 5649.16s]  Probably not.
[5651.16s -> 5653.64s]  If I'm scrolling through Cable
[5655.00s -> 5658.75s]  and I land on the Hobbit
[5658.75s -> 5661.55s]  and there's 45 minutes left in the movie?
[5661.55s -> 5662.99s]  Yeah, sure, I'll catch the end.
[5663.71s -> 5664.21s]  Why not?
[5673.95s -> 5674.83s]  Please get out of my way.
[5675.39s -> 5677.53s]  Please get out of my fucking way.
[5678.17s -> 5679.69s]  Don't even fucking think about it, seriously.
[5680.57s -> 5683.95s]  Come on, don't even think about it.
[5683.95s -> 5686.43s]  I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.
[5687.07s -> 5687.57s]  It's close.
[5688.43s -> 5696.20s]  Just let it cool down.
[5696.76s -> 5701.13s]  But no, I wouldn't really choose to watch the Hobbit movies.
[5701.13s -> 5722.14s]  But I, it's not, not like I hate them.
[5722.14s -> 5723.34s]  He does hate them.
[5723.34s -> 5723.98s]  No, he doesn't.
[5726.64s -> 5728.56s]  Hold on, let me get through this.
[5729.20s -> 5739.34s]  You just knocked him back up, dude.
[5742.09s -> 5743.85s]  I don't really, here's, okay, the thing about movies.
[5745.80s -> 5747.80s]  I don't really hate movies.
[5750.14s -> 5750.86s]  I don't really.
[5751.74s -> 5753.02s]  I hate video games.
[5753.02s -> 5754.14s]  Like, you know what it is?
[5754.14s -> 5756.30s]  Because I'm in control of the video game.
[5756.86s -> 5760.30s]  And I feel like I'm being personally slighted when I, as my avatar,
[5760.30s -> 5761.58s]  can't do something I'd like to do.
[5763.23s -> 5763.47s]  Right?
[5763.47s -> 5766.51s]  But a movie, I'm watching somebody else, I don't care.
[5766.51s -> 5768.51s]  Like, if the movie sucks, whatever, I had nothing to do with it.
[5771.96s -> 5774.76s]  If something bad happens to me in a game, I had something to do with it.
[5775.40s -> 5778.30s]  But I don't, I don't hate movies, really.
[5778.94s -> 5791.74s]  I can not, I can think movies aren't really good, but no.
[5791.74s -> 5794.86s]  There is no Surge 2 for me, or Surge, no, I didn't play the Surge 2.
[5794.86s -> 5795.66s]  There is no Surge.
[5796.60s -> 5799.00s]  That's not even the worst game I think I've ever played, either.
[5799.00s -> 5800.20s]  Like, why am I even saying that?
[5800.20s -> 5801.16s]  This feels unfair.
[5802.24s -> 5803.84s]  All right, can you stop getting on the ladder?
[5803.84s -> 5805.76s]  All right, I gotta pay attention, because I'm not doing this again.
[5822.49s -> 5823.69s]  The one time I don't swing.
[5824.33s -> 5825.13s]  Swing!
[5825.13s -> 5826.49s]  You're just waiting for me to do it.
[5832.65s -> 5838.03s]  Okay, just, I got this two health packs up there.
[5841.29s -> 5842.81s]  Now I'm gonna try hard as Sam.
[5842.81s -> 5843.29s]  Yes, I am.
[5844.01s -> 5851.29s]  Come on, don't.
[5851.85s -> 5858.43s]  Okay, all right, all right, all right, easy.
[5863.20s -> 5863.92s]  Oh my god.
[5864.56s -> 5867.61s]  I just tried to do a heavy attack, and he fucking, like, destroyed me.
[5869.26s -> 5876.86s]  Give me the health pack.
[5876.86s -> 5880.38s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[5880.38s -> 5882.62s]  This is, this is a little ridiculous.
[5896.84s -> 5897.32s]  Let's go!
[5920.94s -> 5927.16s]  Level up!
[5927.16s -> 5928.84s]  He's beginning to believe.
[5928.84s -> 5929.34s]  Yes.
[5930.36s -> 5933.47s]  This is the end of the level.
[5933.47s -> 5934.11s]  Yeah, that sucks.
[5944.83s -> 5946.75s]  Have you made a reward to end the stream?
[5949.71s -> 5950.19s]  Reward?
[5950.19s -> 5950.69s]  What?
[5960.04s -> 5974.36s]  150,000 channel points to end stream?
[5978.12s -> 5989.39s]  No, do it.
[5995.44s -> 5996.16s]  At a million?
[5996.16s -> 5997.12s]  No, I don't want that.
[5997.12s -> 6004.94s]  What if I have something big planned?
[6004.94s -> 6008.54s]  Hey guys, here we are on a big stream that took like a few weeks to make.
[6008.54s -> 6009.66s]  Oh, turn the stream off.
[6009.66s -> 6010.46s]  Okay, bye.
[6011.98s -> 6023.71s]  Turn it back on a second later.
[6023.71s -> 6026.19s]  Do you know how much that fucks up with notifications?
[6027.56s -> 6028.76s]  It would just be bad.
[6028.76s -> 6031.64s]  People would just leave and then I would delete a bunch of people
[6031.64s -> 6032.68s]  because they probably wouldn't come back
[6032.68s -> 6033.88s]  because they already got the notification.
[6033.88s -> 6035.48s]  It would screw, no, I'm never doing that.
[6036.84s -> 6045.88s]  10,006.
[6046.44s -> 6048.56s]  All right, what does, what does Sam get?
[6048.56s -> 6049.52s]  I don't even want to put up.
[6055.79s -> 6056.11s]  Nice.
[6056.67s -> 6057.95s]  Okay, Poison Blade.
[6060.75s -> 6061.95s]  Yeah.
[6061.95s -> 6065.47s]  Increases the time that a hobbit is hidden by using his elven cloak.
[6071.95s -> 6072.75s]  Warrior's Bane.
[6073.31s -> 6076.27s]  Parry, then instantly kill a man-sized enemy.
[6079.12s -> 6082.99s]  To everyone.
[6082.99s -> 6087.63s]  As opposed to a child-sized of hobbit-sized enemy.
[6087.63s -> 6088.27s]  I don't understand.
[6099.45s -> 6101.61s]  12,000 poison daggers.
[6103.58s -> 6104.30s]  Strength of iron.
[6104.30s -> 6105.82s]  Permanently increases your health.
[6105.82s -> 6108.38s]  I'm not level five.
[6108.38s -> 6109.90s]  Um, what do I got for all?
[6113.21s -> 6113.93s]  Level four.
[6114.49s -> 6115.61s]  I could get this for everybody.
[6126.83s -> 6127.39s]  Orc Bane.
[6129.23s -> 6131.23s]  Or, uh, probably Orc Bane, right?
[6131.23s -> 6132.43s]  Get Orc Bane for everyone.
[6133.15s -> 6134.03s]  It's so important.
[6135.07s -> 6136.35s]  It's just bang, it's instant.
[6136.91s -> 6140.92s]  Yeah, just get it for everyone.
[6141.96s -> 6142.28s]  You know what?
[6142.28s -> 6143.00s]  I got some points.
[6143.00s -> 6146.04s]  Let's do, um, people are going to be pissed off
[6146.04s -> 6148.20s]  if I don't buy at least one thing for Sam.
[6148.20s -> 6150.78s]  Uh, we'll do, we'll do the cloak.
[6151.98s -> 6154.54s]  Let's see, all the L1, R1, L2, okay.
[6155.10s -> 6164.60s]  An Orc Bane impression.
[6167.96s -> 6169.16s]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[6171.04s -> 6173.04s]  Nah, nah, I don't think so.
[6173.04s -> 6173.68s]  I don't think so.
[6177.12s -> 6178.72s]  It's not, I don't think that's gonna happen.
[6179.36s -> 6188.35s]  Escape from Osgiloth.
[6188.35s -> 6190.03s]  All right, now we're in the main story here.
[6191.63s -> 6192.75s]  But we do have Sam.
[6192.75s -> 6194.67s]  Oh, we have a Sean Astin interview.
[6194.67s -> 6195.31s]  Let's check it out.
[6196.97s -> 6197.85s]  Mordor.
[6197.85s -> 6201.10s]  The one place in Middle Earth we don't want to see any closer.
[6201.90s -> 6203.42s]  The one place we're trying to get to.
[6204.30s -> 6205.66s]  It's just where we can't get.
[6206.38s -> 6209.74s]  Let's face it, Mr. Frodo.
[6209.74s -> 6210.30s]  We're lost.
[6210.30s -> 6214.99s]  There's a lot in the movie where Sam is, the character himself, is very-
[6214.99s -> 6215.71s]  He's American?
[6216.59s -> 6218.11s]  He gets sad a lot.
[6218.11s -> 6220.11s]  He's, there's a kind of comic relief element.
[6220.91s -> 6221.79s]  Holy shit.
[6222.75s -> 6226.33s]  His goodness and his decency is what makes him heroic
[6226.33s -> 6228.81s]  and his, his bravery in the face of great danger.
[6229.29s -> 6230.81s]  I'm going to Mordor alone.
[6230.81s -> 6231.53s]  Of course you are.
[6231.53s -> 6232.33s]  Bro, spoilers.
[6232.33s -> 6234.09s]  And I'm coming with you.
[6234.09s -> 6236.57s]  But because the game is sort of an action war game,
[6236.57s -> 6239.93s]  the aspect of Sam's character that really comes through in the game
[6239.93s -> 6242.17s]  is the kind of heroic, heroic character.
[6242.49s -> 6243.13s]  Fighting Sam.
[6244.89s -> 6247.98s]  I get to really go and fight the orcs instead of having to, you know,
[6247.98s -> 6251.34s]  pull up from stabbing them because it's a stunt guy you don't want to hurt.
[6253.26s -> 6255.90s]  You really feel like you're inside the movie, driving the movie.
[6256.46s -> 6259.10s]  When I actually, for the first time, had a controller in my hands,
[6259.10s -> 6262.46s]  I was looking at a very realistic likeness of myself.
[6262.46s -> 6263.66s]  That's gotta be so crazy.
[6263.66s -> 6265.42s]  And it reminded me of filming the scenes.
[6265.42s -> 6267.34s]  It looked exactly like when we were filming on the sets
[6267.34s -> 6268.94s]  and it was totally interactive.
[6268.94s -> 6269.66s]  I think the game is-
[6269.66s -> 6271.42s]  You really feel like Sam, yeah.
[6276.64s -> 6277.20s]  That's good.
[6278.01s -> 6279.45s]  All right, let's do The King of the Dead.
[6280.41s -> 6291.31s]  I can't fucking believe I'm doing what I did last time.
[6291.31s -> 6293.39s]  We're going to get to a level where I'm stuck for like two hours.
[6293.95s -> 6297.37s]  And it was because I didn't pick Aragorn in the first level.
[6317.07s -> 6320.62s]  Boss?
[6322.72s -> 6323.28s]  Boss fight.
[6324.16s -> 6328.14s]  Wait, wasn't he just talking to Aragorn?
[6328.94s -> 6343.55s]  Ooh, I almost had perfect there.
[6348.06s -> 6348.78s]  Gimli sucks.
[6349.50s -> 6350.14s]  Oh, he doesn't.
[6350.78s -> 6353.72s]  It's just a little small.
[6354.52s -> 6370.76s]  All right, let's go.
[6370.76s -> 6371.24s]  Bring it on.
[6371.96s -> 6373.08s]  I need to get some perfects here.
[6375.08s -> 6375.40s]  What?
[6382.64s -> 6383.84s]  Come on, here it comes.
[6383.84s -> 6384.16s]  Perfect.
[6386.14s -> 6386.94s]  Come on, do it.
[6388.49s -> 6388.89s]  Do it!
[6400.91s -> 6401.79s]  Is there health anywhere?
[6402.59s -> 6411.85s]  Uh-oh.
[6411.85s -> 6414.16s]  I see what you're doing over there.
[6427.69s -> 6429.21s]  Why are you throwing it, Gimli?
[6429.21s -> 6430.65s]  I don't even see where that was.
[6436.54s -> 6436.78s]  Just-
[6440.25s -> 6441.29s]  He does that every time.
[6441.29s -> 6442.17s]  I'm going to have to fight him again.
[6449.55s -> 6450.19s]  Perfect!
[6450.19s -> 6462.86s]  You wasted my perfect meter, dude.
[6464.22s -> 6472.04s]  Oh, he's going to do it again.
[6472.04s -> 6472.36s]  I see.
[6473.87s -> 6476.99s]  Uh-oh, it's like Space Invaders.
[6477.55s -> 6478.97s]  He's already-
[6483.40s -> 6484.12s]  Oh, shit.
[6484.92s -> 6490.76s]  Dude, how many spikes do you get?
[6491.48s -> 6495.26s]  Dang!
[6495.90s -> 6502.76s]  Is he going to do it?
[6502.76s -> 6503.40s]  He's going to do the-
[6504.22s -> 6504.46s]  Oh.
[6507.92s -> 6508.48s]  No health.
[6508.48s -> 6509.12s]  I'm in trouble.
[6513.37s -> 6526.38s]  God, I'm so paranoid.
[6527.18s -> 6532.25s]  Health, got it.
[6532.25s -> 6532.97s]  Nice.
[6532.97s -> 6538.62s]  All right, let's go.
[6538.62s -> 6539.26s]  Bring it on.
[6539.26s -> 6539.98s]  Bring it on.
[6539.98s -> 6540.38s]  Bring it on.
[6540.38s -> 6541.58s]  New commentary for the day.
[6542.38s -> 6543.74s]  I fucking forgot again.
[6544.46s -> 6564.65s]  What's he doing?
[6565.21s -> 6569.15s]  Just another wave.
[6569.95s -> 6573.15s]  Oh, shit.
[6573.15s -> 6574.03s]  And there's archers.
[6575.23s -> 6587.12s]  Hey, he was off screen.
[6587.12s -> 6587.60s]  That's not fair.
[6588.32s -> 6596.01s]  How do you-
[6596.73s -> 6598.97s]  How do you do, fellow warriors?
[6598.97s -> 6600.09s]  That doesn't work here.
[6601.37s -> 6603.18s]  That was so stupid.
[6603.18s -> 6604.30s]  Why do they even read that?
[6606.86s -> 6608.54s]  You do, fellow warriors.
[6613.96s -> 6614.60s]  All right, I win.
[6619.28s -> 6619.76s]  This is it.
[6619.76s -> 6620.56s]  Don't go right in.
[6621.36s -> 6621.93s]  He does the-
[6622.65s -> 6623.77s]  Here we go.
[6623.77s -> 6634.46s]  I win.
[6642.94s -> 6646.14s]  What say you?
[6647.95s -> 6650.27s]  I need you to come off the boat
[6650.27s -> 6651.39s]  and be in the movie
[6651.39s -> 6652.99s]  for 10 seconds in a battle.
[6652.99s -> 6653.71s]  What say you?
[6672.38s -> 6675.37s]  Oh, Jesus.
[6679.02s -> 6680.86s]  No, I'm slow.
[6684.36s -> 6685.32s]  All right, if this is me,
[6686.20s -> 6688.76s]  I have at least 10 or 15 axes
[6688.76s -> 6690.52s]  that I have made for me.
[6691.16s -> 6692.52s]  I am baseball swinging
[6692.52s -> 6693.56s]  and throwing the axe off
[6693.56s -> 6694.52s]  and running with both hands.
[6695.64s -> 6696.60s]  I got extra axes.
[6696.60s -> 6697.00s]  You know what I mean?
[6697.00s -> 6698.36s]  Make sure you have at least
[6698.36s -> 6699.16s]  10 of these that are made.
[6709.15s -> 6716.65s]  I can't see shit.
[6717.37s -> 6718.99s]  Let me know where I am.
[6726.01s -> 6726.41s]  Jesus.
[6729.68s -> 6730.40s]  What the fuck?
[6730.96s -> 6741.07s]  This is fucking idiot over here
[6741.07s -> 6742.19s]  that's messing the whole thing up.
[6755.23s -> 6755.87s]  Who's winning?
[6757.95s -> 6758.83s]  That's a good question.
[6759.87s -> 6761.71s]  I think I am currently.
[6764.67s -> 6767.39s]  We'll see in about 10 seconds
[6767.39s -> 6768.27s]  if that's going to be the case.
[6772.81s -> 6780.96s]  Dude, Jeremy, it's your mother.
[6780.96s -> 6782.64s]  Please stop saying the F word so often.
[6784.19s -> 6785.07s]  My, I learned it from you.
[6785.79s -> 6804.86s]  Okay, this is fun, I guess.
[6814.41s -> 6815.77s]  Get the fuck out of my way.
[6836.94s -> 6837.18s]  Go!
[6837.74s -> 6842.22s]  Wink now.
[6842.22s -> 6856.04s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[6857.74s -> 6858.70s]  No, this level sucks.
[6858.70s -> 6859.50s]  I don't want to do this level again.
[6859.50s -> 6860.06s]  I'm going to try to get through.
[6860.06s -> 6861.10s]  No, no winks, not now.
[6870.17s -> 6871.45s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[6872.17s -> 6875.63s]  Four winks, you'll get it.
[6875.63s -> 6876.03s]  No, no.
[6876.59s -> 6902.43s]  I can't fucking see anything.
[6903.55s -> 6908.41s]  Give me perfect.
[6909.05s -> 6913.60s]  How the fuck do I not have perfect?
[6914.40s -> 6920.89s]  Right at the fucking end.
[6920.89s -> 6921.53s]  Give me a break.
[6939.40s -> 6953.40s]  Wait, is this even more of this shit?
[6954.28s -> 6962.36s]  I'm surprised I did that.
[6968.25s -> 6969.13s]  Six winks.
[6969.77s -> 6970.09s]  What?
[6971.05s -> 6984.01s]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[6991.61s -> 7003.08s]  That's a triple perk.
[7003.08s -> 7004.04s]  The purple.
[7004.04s -> 7004.60s]  What?
[7004.60s -> 7005.08s]  Purple?
[7006.52s -> 7007.40s]  Why can't I say this?
[7007.40s -> 7007.88s]  Purple.
[7008.60s -> 7009.08s]  Perfect.
[7013.82s -> 7014.46s]  What happened?
[7014.46s -> 7014.70s]  What?
[7015.42s -> 7023.26s]  I thought, what do you mean?
[7023.26s -> 7024.38s]  I ran the wrong way.
[7024.38s -> 7025.34s]  What the hell?
[7025.34s -> 7027.71s]  What the fuck was that?
[7027.71s -> 7030.43s]  All right, Jesus.
[7031.15s -> 7041.44s]  What the fuck was that?
[7042.24s -> 7043.60s]  I mean, I ran the wrong way.
[7044.48s -> 7048.22s]  Oh, come on.
[7048.22s -> 7049.58s]  Don't have to do this whole thing again, do I?
[7050.94s -> 7051.98s]  Oh, give me a break.
[7054.73s -> 7055.77s]  What the fuck?
[7055.77s -> 7057.05s]  That was playing pretty well, too.
[7058.09s -> 7059.69s]  How did I run the wrong way?
[7060.73s -> 7072.83s]  You missed a wink.
[7073.55s -> 7080.88s]  You ran into the wall instead of the door.
[7080.88s -> 7082.08s]  No, fuck that.
[7082.08s -> 7082.56s]  Come on.
[7082.56s -> 7083.28s]  Give me a break.
[7092.60s -> 7094.20s]  Winks are worthless now.
[7097.31s -> 7098.51s]  That was hard, too.
[7099.47s -> 7115.61s]  Not a bad start.
[7116.25s -> 7120.25s]  Except this stupid motherfucker in the back with the dumb bow and arrow.
[7120.97s -> 7121.77s]  I hate arrows.
[7122.73s -> 7125.93s]  It's so hard to see anything in this fucking game.
[7125.93s -> 7127.61s]  Let alone the guy shooting the arrows.
[7128.41s -> 7134.64s]  Missed another wink.
[7134.64s -> 7135.12s]  No, I didn't.
[7135.12s -> 7135.92s]  I did two extras.
[7137.32s -> 7140.36s]  I did two extra winks, so I'm covered for those two that I missed.
[7154.35s -> 7154.67s]  Damn it.
[7154.67s -> 7155.71s]  I don't want to do this again.
[7155.71s -> 7157.15s]  This mission is so dumb.
[7158.03s -> 7159.31s]  This doesn't even happen in the movie.
[7160.03s -> 7160.67s]  There's a cut.
[7161.63s -> 7163.15s]  It cuts to them being outside.
[7182.25s -> 7184.09s]  Get out of my fucking way.
[7184.09s -> 7184.97s]  Come on, give me.
[7185.61s -> 7192.54s]  I'm not even fucking...
[7193.50s -> 7198.25s]  Why wouldn't you put the camera like even 30 degrees higher than this?
[7201.85s -> 7204.57s]  All I see is green smoke.
[7204.57s -> 7227.82s]  Does anyone else taste iron?
[7227.82s -> 7228.38s]  That's blood.
[7228.94s -> 7230.30s]  You're tasting blood.
[7230.30s -> 7238.75s]  I don't know why you're tasting blood, but I would maybe figure it out.
[7238.75s -> 7240.19s]  Maybe you bit your tongue or something.
[7240.19s -> 7241.15s]  Just be careful.
[7241.15s -> 7251.13s]  All right, this time I'm not going to fuck it up.
[7251.13s -> 7251.53s]  Let's go.
[7252.41s -> 7265.88s]  I beat this game again and again when I was eight.
[7265.88s -> 7266.36s]  No, you didn't.
[7272.54s -> 7274.22s]  What the fuck is going on?
[7275.58s -> 7276.08s]  Why?
[7277.58s -> 7278.62s]  Come on.
[7278.62s -> 7279.58s]  Fuck this level.
[7280.54s -> 7281.10s]  Too slow.
[7281.10s -> 7281.66s]  I was...
[7281.66s -> 7282.70s]  I'm walking down.
[7283.26s -> 7284.46s]  That's not the wrong way.
[7285.26s -> 7293.48s]  I'm literally walking down.
[7303.44s -> 7304.88s]  What the fuck?
[7304.88s -> 7306.57s]  What did I do wrong?
[7306.57s -> 7306.97s]  I didn't do...
[7306.97s -> 7307.93s]  I just was walking.
[7309.05s -> 7318.89s]  Oh, that was stupid.
[7330.11s -> 7332.19s]  You know, these legs are too short.
[7332.19s -> 7333.71s]  That's probably like whatever.
[7334.67s -> 7335.87s]  Did I fuck it up again?
[7337.07s -> 7361.69s]  I mean, he's perfect.
[7361.69s -> 7373.66s]  Okay, can we please keep going?
[7374.30s -> 7383.44s]  It's happening again.
[7383.44s -> 7384.16s]  Oh, no.
[7384.16s -> 7384.80s]  Oh, God.
[7384.80s -> 7385.60s]  It's happening again.
[7388.36s -> 7388.60s]  What?
[7388.60s -> 7392.12s]  The Jeremy runs into terrible game design choices?
[7392.84s -> 7393.40s]  The stream?
[7394.20s -> 7395.24s]  Is that what you're describing?
[7411.52s -> 7412.64s]  Blame the player not...
[7412.64s -> 7413.20s]  No, no, no.
[7413.20s -> 7413.92s]  Blame game.
[7413.92s -> 7414.72s]  Only blame game.
[7416.06s -> 7417.18s]  It's never my fault.
[7417.18s -> 7418.38s]  Only blame video game.
[7454.01s -> 7455.61s]  Call Peter Jackson right now.
[7456.17s -> 7457.05s]  I don't have...
[7457.05s -> 7459.13s]  I don't know what Peter Jackson's fucking telephone number is
[7459.13s -> 7460.49s]  and he had nothing to do with this game.
[7461.21s -> 7493.00s]  We're good.
[7493.00s -> 7493.32s]  We're good.
[7493.32s -> 7493.64s]  We're good.
[7493.64s -> 7493.88s]  We're good.
[7493.88s -> 7494.20s]  We're good.
[7494.20s -> 7494.28s]  We're good.
[7494.28s -> 7495.08s]  We're good.
[7495.08s -> 7496.12s]  We're good.
[7496.12s -> 7500.72s]  Nice frames.
[7500.72s -> 7502.48s]  They're actually not even as bad as you're saying.
[7503.04s -> 7504.40s]  They're only like 10 frames.
[7504.40s -> 7505.12s]  Sorry.
[7505.12s -> 7520.49s]  I'm just gonna just bam square because of what...
[7520.49s -> 7522.01s]  I'm just gonna get perfects by doing this
[7522.01s -> 7522.97s]  because there's so many people here.
[7526.30s -> 7526.78s]  And...
[7538.00s -> 7539.44s]  I can't even.
[7542.44s -> 7543.96s]  I guess I hit somebody with an axe.
[7544.68s -> 7562.97s]  Is that...
[7573.56s -> 7573.96s]  I guess...
[7595.20s -> 7599.28s]  Three come out.
[7599.28s -> 7599.60s]  And then I...
[7599.60s -> 7600.00s]  Okay.
[7600.00s -> 7600.64s]  Where's the right...
[7600.64s -> 7601.20s]  Where did I go?
[7601.20s -> 7602.00s]  Where's the right way?
[7602.80s -> 7605.16s]  Look at this.
[7605.16s -> 7606.04s]  Doesn't this break away?
[7606.04s -> 7607.24s]  This looks like it breaks away
[7607.24s -> 7608.12s]  but it's not this way.
[7608.92s -> 7610.11s]  This is down here.
[7610.83s -> 7612.73s]  I gotta get this right for when I need to leave.
[7618.12s -> 7618.68s]  Down here.
[7621.31s -> 7621.71s]  Left?
[7623.23s -> 7624.43s]  Like the way that I came in?
[7626.60s -> 7627.24s]  Like over here.
[7627.96s -> 7633.23s]  Your other left.
[7633.23s -> 7633.87s]  That is left.
[7634.43s -> 7638.08s]  So this way.
[7638.08s -> 7650.35s]  What are we doing?
[7651.07s -> 7652.64s]  All right.
[7652.64s -> 7653.20s]  Let's go.
[7653.20s -> 7653.84s]  I don't want to be...
[7656.75s -> 7657.15s]  More...
[7657.15s -> 7658.35s]  What's going on?
[7658.35s -> 7659.07s]  What's happening?
[7659.95s -> 7661.39s]  What is going on?
[7661.39s -> 7661.71s]  What?
[7668.17s -> 7668.81s]  What the...
[7668.81s -> 7673.32s]  The art that took too long?
[7674.04s -> 7675.10s]  I...
[7675.10s -> 7678.04s]  That was the last art...
[7678.04s -> 7679.56s]  Why are they even spawning?
[7679.56s -> 7680.28s]  What the...
[7680.28s -> 7681.32s]  Give me a break.
[7682.12s -> 7683.80s]  Oh, I'm actually mad about this.
[7688.12s -> 7689.79s]  What the fuck, man?
[7690.67s -> 7699.82s]  They're spawning the archer over on the right
[7699.82s -> 7701.42s]  where the camera don't even fucking look.
[7702.14s -> 7705.07s]  Does that...
[7705.07s -> 7705.31s]  What...
[7706.19s -> 7706.51s]  I can't...
[7706.51s -> 7707.63s]  What am I gonna complain about?
[7707.63s -> 7709.31s]  A 20-year-old game that...
[7709.31s -> 7709.87s]  Who cares?
[7710.75s -> 7716.11s]  Oh, sorry.
[7716.11s -> 7717.79s]  17-year-old game.
[7717.79s -> 7723.48s]  I have to pee too.
[7724.20s -> 7726.01s]  Can I skip this mission?
[7726.57s -> 7747.07s]  Give me some perfects.
[7747.79s -> 7757.84s]  I liked it better when Christopher Lee was talking.
[7758.48s -> 7759.36s]  That was interesting.
[7763.13s -> 7764.17s]  I can't even get that help.
[7771.08s -> 7772.60s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[7784.27s -> 7787.55s]  They always have to do stuff with this bullshit.
[7787.55s -> 7787.95s]  All right.
[7787.95s -> 7788.99s]  I'm gonna beat this one.
[7789.55s -> 7790.75s]  I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[7791.39s -> 7794.67s]  Is it too early to be malding?
[7795.47s -> 7797.63s]  I hate timed missions, no matter what it is.
[7797.63s -> 7800.03s]  I hate scrolling Mario levels for the same damn reason.
[7800.75s -> 7802.35s]  Guys, don't put pressure on me.
[7802.35s -> 7802.83s]  Fuck off.
[7803.55s -> 7804.83s]  I want to play the game.

[7835.64s -> 7837.32s]  lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock.
[7837.96s -> 7841.58s]  I'm gonna die.
[7842.78s -> 7847.20s]  I'm gonna die in here.
[7848.00s -> 7849.45s]  If I die again, I have to go pee.
[7860.76s -> 7861.40s]  Pee your pants.
[7861.96s -> 7862.84s]  No, no, no.
[7862.84s -> 7863.48s]  Don't tell me to do that.
[7863.48s -> 7864.20s]  That's not a good idea.
[7864.92s -> 7887.10s]  What the fuck am I walking into right now?
[7889.40s -> 7891.56s]  There's nothing in that water, man.
[7891.56s -> 7893.00s]  There's nothing in that water.
[7894.43s -> 7894.83s]  All right.
[7894.83s -> 7895.31s]  This is it.
[7895.31s -> 7895.79s]  Let's go.
[7897.40s -> 7898.44s]  I'm trying as hard as I can.
[7898.44s -> 7899.16s]  Am I gonna save work?

[10796.33s -> 10829.58s]  that means nothing and by the way the cameras are going to change angles 15 times ladder levels
[10829.58s -> 10838.00s]  not another ladder level and we let's go all right i'm ready destroy the siege tower i try i try to
[10838.00s -> 10845.50s]  just do it but we have cinematic towers to climb and another timed ass mission in this timed ass
[10845.50s -> 10859.18s]  game god damn it i can't fucking believe i have to do this again we already did this in the last
[10859.26s -> 10864.54s]  game this doesn't even happen in return of the king they just wanted to redo it because it was
[10864.54s -> 10905.16s]  easy to put it as its own level lord of the ladders god damn it man fucking even is anybody
[10905.80s -> 10927.55s]  get your shit out of here all right i'm gonna call that there's something wrong with your
[10927.55s -> 10934.76s]  fucking gauge there's nobody here why would that be at like 50 filled there's only one ladder
[10948.03s -> 10950.67s]  go all the way over here all right and then i gotta remember where the
[10951.55s -> 10956.57s]  catapulted nothing over here right no
[10968.04s -> 10971.32s]  dude this this this these camera changes make me want to throw up into my hands and use it to
[10971.32s -> 10992.70s]  wash my face it's seriously the most disorienting fucking thing ever what the fuck this is on the
[10992.70s -> 11010.38s]  same plane we've changed directions like four times you have a two link debt that's all right
[11010.38s -> 11027.93s]  i'll settle it up later two links in the sink god damn i don't want to do another ladder level
[11028.65s -> 11039.79s]  nobody wants to do a ladder push level here we go and there's already a bunch of people
[11039.79s -> 11048.17s]  up here and i have to shoot it twice fuck oh man oh man here we go here we go again
[11050.33s -> 11062.84s]  uh we're gonna go up here and we're gonna get this over with you can't why can't you just fire
[11062.84s -> 11069.15s]  without me i need to tell you when to fire just fire you're in the right spot why do you need
[11069.15s -> 11109.05s]  someone to tell you to do it just do it clean up some of this shit fucking flashbacks and now
[11109.61s -> 11132.33s]  i'm already overwhelmed i have to fire them i'm gonna lose hey idiots the what do you what are
[11132.33s -> 11137.05s]  you aiming at why is this not turning the other direction what why is it not firing in the
[11137.61s -> 11147.15s]  direction why would it not be firing into the right side no i'm very confused they only want
[11147.15s -> 11162.96s]  to shoot at the one coming in on the left side what the fuck is that they won't rotate it what
[11162.96s -> 11167.28s]  to shoot the tower yourself well what that what in the name of god is the reason to use the
[11167.28s -> 11199.16s]  catapult in the first place oh my god there's no nothing there's no reason to okay here we go
[11199.16s -> 11222.83s]  i'm gonna i'm just gonna ignore it somebody said that uh 80 percent well you know you could say
[11222.91s -> 11228.67s]  that that's that's accurate i don't think it's not 80 a significant portion of my 2020 streams have
[11228.67s -> 11234.19s]  been running around pushing ladders down that's true now how many hours have i streamed in 2020
[11234.19s -> 11240.35s]  anybody know do we have any do we have that data because at least six of those hours or so have
[11240.35s -> 11245.85s]  been pushing ladders down in the middle of the ring stage i mean it's got to be like probably
[11245.85s -> 11278.59s]  five percent six percent what the fuck hit me all right let's get that to 12 percent all right all
[11278.59s -> 11290.09s]  right i'm gonna stop reading chat and play the game you know what go down here it's probably
[11290.09s -> 11306.08s]  easier for me to hit these just go all the way around right that's the scrap anytime there's any
[11306.08s -> 11343.07s]  more than one in the middle where is this where's this thing tiny ass ladder die

[11974.68s -> 11978.92s]  at the top of the wall he and oh he and mckellan
[11995.07s -> 12000.24s]  quarters in england of ea was me doing the crack what the fuck is this
[12000.48s -> 12009.34s]  game which the curiosity of gandalf that there are many of us this is me but then when we were
[12009.34s -> 12014.78s]  making the film there was my double and there was the stunt gandalfs the ones who did the fights and
[12014.78s -> 12020.70s]  their twelves and then there's the digitalized gandalfs who are sometimes seen in the crowd scenes
[12020.70s -> 12026.70s]  in the film then there's the gandalf of this um this guy the gandalf is seven thousand years
[12026.70s -> 12032.78s]  old but he can do the most remarkable things and he's still got that's a long time and i only wish
[12032.78s -> 12043.05s]  that gandalf in the film had been quite as agile as gandalf the wisest of you will choose to imagine
[12043.05s -> 12055.47s]  being alive maybe the most of that long immortal character or something immortal if you can't be
[12055.47s -> 12059.23s]  in the movie you might as well play the game it's the next best thing i've been alive and being able
[12059.23s -> 12065.87s]  to see the dinosaurs become extinct it's too much info to have all right let's go on the other
[12065.95s -> 12073.79s]  let's go back to our to our hobbit crew seven thousand no i know seven thousand years is not
[12073.79s -> 12078.88s]  seven million i'm just saying if you if you were immortal you would just watch whole civil no i
[12078.88s -> 12083.69s]  wouldn't want to do that a thousand years would be fun though like you'd be able to live a thousand
[12083.69s -> 12106.78s]  years that's kind of interesting i would not i wouldn't want to live forever golem's treachery
[12106.78s -> 12117.64s]  may yet be the ruin of our plan but only guide frodo to his doom really won't live forever
[12118.60s -> 12129.87s]  we're trapped i'm pretzels dreamer you look like golem you look like golem he has actually

[12890.68s -> 12894.49s]  two towers for me the turn of the king is really good but it's it's two towers i think

[12947.77s -> 12957.42s]  block block block and then go in with a couple of swings yeah it looks like it's just block block
[12957.42s -> 12974.25s]  swing maybe not i don't think that's what i have to do okay what what happens in the movie doesn't
[12974.25s -> 13005.77s]  he do something in the movie giant enemy spider they're done okay good i just keep running we

[14366.09s -> 14391.56s]  have to put the can on this one in like six months before i already got a buff so he can do a parry
[14391.56s -> 14401.96s]  now and he can do this combo finally it only took a million what the fuck happening right now
[14408.38s -> 14423.47s]  are you finished yes i am well not i mean strange still going but you know all right we're at the
[14423.47s -> 14438.32s]  final three levels of the game i i can't believe there's still more coming in the final four levels
[14438.32s -> 14460.60s]  see oh hold on elijah wood let's see what elijah has to say one ring never gets to join in any
[14460.60s -> 14465.16s]  battles in the film so i was always the kind of the one that was really weak and burdened by the
[14465.16s -> 14469.72s]  ring and in this i get to take photo on some adventures that he didn't actually get to go on
[14470.76s -> 14477.87s]  i'm a playable character that's cool yes photo style combat's kind of a little clunkier it's
[14477.87s -> 14485.39s]  not it's not as finessed as aragorn or certainly legolas would be potatoes kind of fighting very
[14485.39s -> 14489.55s]  straightforward i thought that was him falling down the stairs for a second to sort of be able

[20687.79s -> 20692.27s]  wait till he accidentally finds himself in the perfect spot to fall off the edge i can't push
[20692.27s -> 20715.12s]  him i can't hurt him i can't do anything oh so what happened with the other side what the fuck
[20718.01s -> 20729.02s]  jeremy you can't beat the joke character he is not the joke character all right i mean okay you
[20729.02s -> 20741.98s]  could say that golem is the jar jar binks of lord of the rings but he's like comedy and he's he's
[20741.98s -> 20758.73s]  got like he's he's like the comic relief and he's back how is golem comedy relief let me like say
[20758.73s -> 20762.89s]  weird things and they get like in little fights and stuff while they're traveling together and
[20763.61s -> 20768.08s]  he's like i don't like you and shit like that he's like a he's like a comedy character
[20768.80s -> 20800.40s]  they get in like little funny arguments like the three of them oh what my girlfriend heard
[20800.40s -> 20805.28s]  what you said and she literally got sad but that i said that golem was the comic relief character
[20811.82s -> 20846.70s]  as i compared golem to jar jar binks apologize two relationships ruined today but is it golem or
[20846.70s -> 20862.17s]  golem not this time golem it's golem right all right oh off edge what was wrong with that
[20862.65s -> 20891.82s]  this time can i throw shit at him give me this but i hear loud sticking noises back up back up
[20891.82s -> 20907.18s]  again back up back and unruly just get under the edge he's gonna do the he's gonna do the thing
[20907.90s -> 20925.50s]  come here come here come here come here come here all right back up i need health this game's plot
[20925.58s -> 20933.23s]  sucked uh take that up with uh five thousand people that now are going to be very mad at you
[20933.87s -> 20944.83s]  all right get him over there block him off block him off we gotta do like a formation here
[20944.83s -> 20954.46s]  good no no no no no between here go back don't let him all right here we go dive over here okay

[20970.14s -> 21004.46s]  that's it hey hey i'm getting stuck where is he where is he where is he where is he all right
[21004.46s -> 21020.72s]  get over here fall down okay you can fall now there you go last one bye do you let it go
[21020.72s -> 21039.23s]  that really wasn't that bad this is annoying the ring is destroyed and all that was done by that
[21039.23s -> 21046.11s]  power is passing away they do it those who were banned to the fate of the one are now free real
[21046.11s -> 21053.31s]  crowded now come the days of the king may they be blessed while the thrones of the valor endure
[21058.08s -> 21065.50s]  so do you think they're ever gonna do like the ring awakens do another trilogy after
[21070.11s -> 21083.45s]  secret fire of honor saron in his greed as saron mingled his own blood with the ring's gold so
[21083.45s -> 21104.81s]  did i mingle myself with my magic to live here i wove but a spell of trust and fellowship given
[21104.81s -> 21113.15s]  free but why was that yeah why is that in here it's finished that doesn't even happen in this
[21113.15s -> 21122.19s]  work of others we actually did just watch we watched all the lord of the rings on screen
[21122.83s -> 21125.74s]  we actually got to do it oh
[21125.74s -> 21128.14s]  oh
[21128.70s -> 21136.41s]  that's why they did that it was a it was a shout out for the dvd
[21147.74s -> 21161.13s]  three so i'm assuming you can build up how would you build up your perfect meter and then do the
[21161.13s -> 21164.17s]  last hit on him is that how you supposed to do that that would probably a huge pain in the ass
[21170.68s -> 21191.34s]  well let's uh go on a spending spree now i need to level 10 anybody level 10 what's the percentage
[21194.04s -> 21206.86s]  80% of what's gonna be like 85 86 who would win in a fight 1v1 golem versus jar jar
[21208.70s -> 21218.49s]  it jar jar it would absolutely be jar jar it would not be going it wouldn't be going
[21219.71s -> 21224.35s]  andy's interview will avoid interview
[21227.63s -> 21242.46s]  a lot of interviews here secret codes start press the start button press and hold all those buttons
[21242.46s -> 21254.64s]  then input the sequence uh there's no like big head mode i'm not interested at all what is this
[21254.64s -> 21270.22s]  one is this a secret level oh we can be sam frodo pippin mary or faramir these are great secret
[21270.22s -> 21284.24s]  characters i'm not gonna be able to do this with farmer no golem i what would his moves be we'll
[21284.24s -> 21284.80s]  do gandalf
[21286.96s -> 21301.29s]  and then i want to see the andy sirksey interview i shall free the minds of your servants and teach
[21301.29s -> 21317.08s]  them fear i shall render them useless to you perfect mode here we go i'm gonna have to kill 20
[21326.70s -> 21346.75s]  helms hammer uh how do i only kill one person oh it's the way it's waves okay come here come on
[21346.75s -> 21378.19s]  come on come on kind of slow but it does a lot of damage you're never gonna beat this no i
[21378.19s -> 21405.72s]  no i i don't plan on it bring it together come on lots of perfect what you still alive 2004 was a
[21405.72s -> 21418.78s]  good year yeah it was it really was whoa that's a lot of missiles can i block them all at the same
[21418.78s -> 21434.09s]  time and get it perfect and check this out ready ready here we go here we go and here we go
[21434.81s -> 21453.56s]  i thought it was gonna be way cooler than that but whatever stop what you all right you is that
[21453.56s -> 21464.54s]  really all it takes to do to get away from gandalf float backwards of two steps that's right prime was
[21466.52s -> 21472.67s]  i mean the 2000s the early 2000s like from 2000 to 2010 i mean do you talk i don't think there'll
[21472.67s -> 21481.71s]  be that rivals somewhere in the mid 90s the heyday of the super nintendo and sega genesis there was
[21481.71s -> 21489.28s]  some unbeatable games and then 64 think about the shit that came out in n64 oh man think about
[21489.28s -> 21497.02s]  the shit that came out of super nintendo in like 94 95 96 what a great what a great like
[21497.74s -> 21509.93s]  i was gonna say season he actually thinks the n64 is good um i mean super mario 64 and like
[21510.73s -> 21522.72s]  zelda games and we've got to be kidding 1064 i'm just talking about banjo kazooie yeah i think i
[21522.72s -> 21535.98s]  think you guys are messing around yeah you have to be what's banjo kazooie um i mean i don't
[21535.98s -> 21543.16s]  need should i even respond to that i feel like that's just somebody making a joke uh banjo kazooie
[21543.16s -> 21547.24s]  no i'm not responding so um i'm gonna lose here because i'm not paying attention anymore
[21548.20s -> 21554.94s]  i banned that person but not knowing what banjo kazooie is that's petty but go ahead and do it
[21555.66s -> 21577.13s]  come on one more get to seven shoot the giant egg that is it for me not even close to as hard
[21577.13s -> 21583.85s]  as two towers i played in the same difficulty too there's normal although i did get really
[21583.85s -> 21602.49s]  really really lucky at the very end of the um at elephant level easy can i get to 10 it's really
[21602.49s -> 21608.92s]  not even that bad it's actually kind of fun but i'm not gonna do it elephant level is the hardest
[21608.92s -> 21616.59s]  one yeah i got really lucky i i had one health pixel off from losing i'm doing the whole damn
[21616.59s -> 21632.94s]  thing again i'm running away that's cheap all right well that uh that you that has been you've now
[21632.94s -> 21651.98s]  seen all the lord of the rings trilogy on this stream thanks for watching did i unlock something
[21651.98s -> 21657.52s]  else what's going on oh i wanted to i want to watch the uh andy circus interview yeah this is
[21657.52s -> 21677.21s]  important what did they steal a major addict who who just needed to need yeah i compared him to
[21677.21s -> 21685.52s]  charge i think those nodding no i don't think that's correct because we're using motion capture a lot
[21685.52s -> 21689.68s]  um and the animators are watching my performance closely on screen and mapping
[21690.40s -> 21695.68s]  their animators keyframe animators are matching every expression it's called facial structure and
[21695.68s -> 21700.48s]  the way that his face moves is based on the form way mine does so it goes through three processes
[21700.48s -> 21704.72s]  i shoot on set with elijah and sean and we act all the scenes together this guy right here is
[21704.72s -> 21712.88s]  a pioneer repeating every single scene and then i do the final voice track yes precious the voice
[21712.88s -> 21719.76s]  was was really um born out of two things one was trying to find a psychological route into why he
[21719.76s -> 21727.72s]  speaks like that but actually in physical terms it it it came from i knew it we had three cats at
[21728.04s -> 21730.12s]  home and i knew it was a cat
[21734.65s -> 21735.05s]  what do they do
[21744.88s -> 21749.44s]  you know i'm getting my head back into thinking okay see you know this is great minds think alike
[21749.44s -> 21754.11s]  andy i agree all that through a game so it's actually quite nice to sort of visit where i'm
[21754.11s -> 21757.95s]  going to be going for the film it's probably you know an unusual way of doing it where you do the
[21757.95s -> 21762.91s]  do the voice for the game before you actually do the adr for the film that's kind of weird
[21762.99s -> 21769.15s]  and we be the master he did this first he had to do this first before they even did the movie
[21769.15s -> 21778.62s]  voice acting what's this one down here nothing here don't forget a perfect on every level
[21781.15s -> 21788.35s]  uh what about uh what about billy what about billy boy
[21793.88s -> 21798.84s]  thank you but not really you've just unlocked all these other characters like me one of them
[21798.84s -> 21805.72s]  being me so now you can take me and mary and anyone else to places that they didn't actually
[21805.72s -> 21814.52s]  go to like osgillia or paths of the dead yeah take pippin to paths of the dead let's see what
[21814.52s -> 21835.72s]  would happen if he went there okay let's take pippin to pippin to paths of the dead that's
[21835.72s -> 21852.41s]  pretty cool i'm just doing what the actor wanted me to do what would happen if it was in this war
[21854.17s -> 21861.29s]  it was made by those who are dead and the dead keep it the way is shut malice lies heavy in the
[21861.29s -> 21871.55s]  air the dead it's all right it's there's really no change here from behind there's no change
[21872.43s -> 21881.28s]  there's not a big difference here it's just another small guy i wonder what would happen
[21881.28s -> 21913.53s]  if if pippin were to be here the spirits of the dead pretty good actually pretty good pippin
[21914.33s -> 21928.70s]  not bad actually pippin's pretty good then no voice lines yet this should be more specters see
[21930.06s -> 21940.64s]  can pippin throw big things oh fuck he's pretty good that's not pippin yes it is
[21958.12s -> 21969.08s]  hello all right takes more than like three hits to die as level one um
[21969.96s -> 21985.95s]  why is he gonna play through this level right now does he have any lines he has to
[21986.67s -> 22004.03s]  when gimli talks he's gonna say something hey someone's saying currently reading the lord of
[22004.03s -> 22023.85s]  the rings books are you really nice star ever spoiling the whole series magic coming to the
[22023.85s -> 22029.13s]  stream and you're getting ready to read all the books and spend weeks or months reading all of
[22029.13s -> 22034.43s]  them you just watch what just happened with all of them i'm not gonna what i'm not gonna talk
[22034.43s -> 22047.07s]  about months yeah months it could take a long time to read a book especially the lord of the
[22047.07s -> 22052.46s]  rings the lord of the rings are huge you read like a chapter a night two chapters a night for
[22052.46s -> 22079.12s]  all the books it's probably take you it probably takes you fucking at least a few weeks everybody
[22079.12s -> 22086.96s]  stops fighting when i'm not here oh man i've read the books i've i just started a game of thrones i
[22086.96s -> 22101.50s]  love it should we tell them should we tell them that the the next two books are literally just
[22101.50s -> 22108.35s]  never gonna come out should we tell them i've been waiting almost 10 years for that fifth book
[22108.35s -> 22112.00s]  just want to make sure you understand that book's probably never releasing
[22117.45s -> 22124.83s]  i finished that i finished uh dance of dragons in like 2011 and it was like yeah here we go i'm
[22124.83s -> 22130.12s]  gonna know when's the winner is coming out like in a year it's been almost 10 fucking years the
[22130.12s -> 22136.22s]  book's never coming out i want to make sure you're aware that if you're gonna get into like the games
[22136.54s -> 22154.32s]  books you're gonna be with the rest of us for real soon and don't leave it to hbo like oh well
[22154.32s -> 22164.88s]  whatever i'll just watch hbo no don't do that be careful there it's uh we are trapped here
[22166.24s -> 22198.49s]  it's not tv it's hbo that's true it's pretty good yeah it became so yeah oh i don't i don't
[22198.49s -> 22202.49s]  really want to talk about gamers wrong or anything because i don't obviously don't want people that
[22202.49s -> 22206.09s]  haven't seen it or they're planning on getting interested or you know i don't want to be talking
[22206.09s -> 22209.45s]  about like well let me tell you about this part and this part of it no that's not we don't have to do
[22209.45s -> 22227.12s]  that but it's uh one of the big fans i wasn't a big fan pippen are you all right pippen you're
[22227.12s -> 22233.04s]  all right if it's dead okay uh now we know what happens pippen dies if he goes in there cool
[22248.65s -> 22255.45s]  all right let's get this one here we go mary what does mary have to say to us
[22258.12s -> 22266.76s]  very very well thank you a lot quicker than three and a half years to finish it excitement crazy
[22266.76s -> 22271.80s]  crazy excitement you've now unlocked two other characters what i have you can take mary or
[22271.80s -> 22276.36s]  pippen and you can go on any storyline you want i you could go and hang out with she loved for a
[22276.36s -> 22281.00s]  while what you could go with faramir and you know see what his journey's like that would be fun you
[22281.00s -> 22286.70s]  can hang out with gandalf because he's very protective and he feels like a father you can
[22286.70s -> 22291.58s]  do anything you want you can go anywhere you want with mary and pippen so this is now our
[22291.58s -> 22307.47s]  treat to you as a gamer mistake leave in the shire in the shire you know mary looks kind of
[22307.47s -> 22315.39s]  sweet and approachable as when he wears his war outfit he just can't think the people who would
[22315.39s -> 22319.87s]  choose all right so are mary and people mary and pippen the jar jar banks of that's more accurate
[22319.87s -> 22325.63s]  right highly intelligent people in the world no that's dead is the hobbit oh i want a sandwich
[22325.63s -> 22330.92s]  i want to have some no what are you talking about someone who you know comes to the table
[22330.92s -> 22335.32s]  that's more accurate than gauntlet physical strength but he's is wily and has a bit of
[22335.32s -> 22349.34s]  guile what about second breakfast yeah they say yeah they like kind of comic relief there are two
[22349.34s -> 22367.98s]  in c3po i don't think that's accurate either well i think we saw everything wait nope
[22369.24s -> 22378.35s]  we have one more interview with faramir was one of the few men who withstood the power of
[22378.35s -> 22385.82s]  faramir and boramir were brothers and it isn't beyond possibility that faramir went to rivendell
[22385.82s -> 22392.64s]  instead and if that happened faramir could have survived and returned to gondor you decide now
[22392.64s -> 22398.33s]  we're going to explore this fact by unlocking the character of faramir see for yourself what
[22398.33s -> 22407.31s]  else you might have done during the war at the ring good luck i mean it's i it's cool but
[22408.11s -> 22414.19s]  it's just you can just take the character you can i don't know it's for alternate time
[22416.44s -> 22422.52s]  game players should unlock faramir first because he's a character who is in possession of multi
[22422.52s -> 22428.44s]  skills he's a great swordsman great archer they actually get any different abilities or no
[22428.44s -> 22435.80s]  i think
[22453.00s -> 22455.00s]  high voltage gameplay guys it's pretty good
[22457.00s -> 22459.08s]  all right that's uh that's it
[22460.52s -> 22467.84s]  does the tree do anything though i didn't miss anything down here did i
[22470.70s -> 22476.62s]  you saw all the interviews all the production stills elijah wood on astin
[22478.14s -> 22489.39s]  game concept art film concept art hobbits on gaming this i'm glad we didn't miss this one
[22489.39s -> 22501.21s]  the best player would be elijah well this is where i get to to pat myself in the back i'm
[22501.21s -> 22508.97s]  definitely a better gamer than the two of them yes elijah has this insane ability of being able
[22508.97s -> 22514.43s]  to just uh grab hold of a console and go through a game i've actually made the the controller
[22514.43s -> 22519.71s]  float and without touching anything i've managed to play the game it's only happened a few times
[22519.71s -> 22525.48s]  but he's not even making that up it's probably real gaming now for probably years and he's doing
[22525.48s -> 22530.28s]  very well uh but i'm still a much more experienced gamer but i'm getting that i can be i wouldn't be
[22530.28s -> 22534.12s]  surprised if elijah wood could do that certainly a lot better he can do everything else he can
[22534.12s -> 22538.68s]  fucking sing he can dance he can act he can cook oh look at me go i'm on fire now he can like
[22538.68s -> 22543.80s]  lift big heavy fucking weights and shit i says okay give us a beat him three times in a row
[22543.80s -> 22551.08s]  billy's getting better but he's not great billy is awful one of the worst game players of all time
[22551.08s -> 22556.52s]  i think i do have a special gift for gaming you'll be playing a two-player game and you'll go billy
[22556.52s -> 22562.76s]  press x and he'll be like hang on a minute wait which one's x but i just haven't really opened

[22634.16s -> 22638.41s]  is hardcore mode but you have to probably defeat the game on heart but yeah that's a good place
[22638.41s -> 22644.24s]  to stop it we are now done with the lord of the rings for now that was good shorter than the last
[22644.24s -> 22648.24s]  one i thought we were gonna be playing this for a little bit longer but it's a good place to stop

[22860.91s -> 22866.49s]  the end of that question i have no idea i think everybody thinks they're gonna get along with
[22866.49s -> 22872.17s]  elijah wood he seems very nice he seems very approachable he seems very down to earth
[22872.17s -> 22878.86s]  i like anybody could probably get along with elijah wood he's he's got that energy to him i
[22878.86s -> 22892.49s]  agree i agree when is his game coming does he have a game coming on why is what is a game coming up
[22894.78s -> 22911.29s]  what is it really what is it elijah wood game elijah wood video game transference

[22929.28s -> 22947.37s]  oh no it's vr it's like a vr fmv game when maybe not fmv that's interesting this is back in 2018 is
[22947.37s -> 22953.71s]  when they were talking about this that's cool that'd be insane actually i'm into it whenever it's
[22953.71s -> 22962.09s]  ready i would take a look no that's cool i did not know that he was doing that i look forward to
[22962.09s -> 22971.48s]  seeing it now what is fmv oh it's already wait it's out now wave is already out it came out in
[22971.48s -> 22984.54s]  2018 what is it on steam imagine an escape room set in a deranged mine experience a first-person
[22984.54s -> 22989.52s]  exploration game in a chilling new dimension shift between three perspectives of a family

[23000.59s -> 23008.27s]  got it's got mostly positive reviews it's got some negative reviews though apparently
[23008.27s -> 23012.43s]  somebody's the people are upset about uh ubisoft doing them let's see let's see
[23016.44s -> 23029.02s]  yeah it's apparently got some issues got some issues one of these reviews says don't buy
[23029.02s -> 23039.28s]  this game if you don't have a vr so what the non-vr version is not very good keep that in mind
[23039.28s -> 23049.93s]  is that ubisoft all right let's keep going espada escalata thanks for 250 hey germa
[23050.65s -> 23054.25s]  jav gaming here we're glad you enjoyed our videos enough to take a week off to enjoy them
[23055.13s -> 23068.64s]  more codes are on the way jav what is jav gaming what the hell is that blue pundit thanks for 300
[23068.64s -> 23075.24s]  bits i used to play this so much i love the nostalgia me too me too potion dweller thanks
[23075.24s -> 23078.60s]  for three dollars hey germa you've been gone for too long this week was painfully slow
[23079.32s -> 23083.50s]  glad to have you back yeah february is going to be a little messed up
[23084.06s -> 23091.95s]  i think it'll this is one of the busiest months in a while i've got physical therapy going which
[23091.95s -> 23096.43s]  i have to go to and i have to stick to i don't know how many times a week this will be going
[23097.47s -> 23100.67s]  i'm gonna assume it's i will assume i have to probably do physical therapy
[23101.79s -> 23108.65s]  maybe once or twice a week whenever i have to do it i'm gonna do it so i'm gonna have to bounce
[23108.65s -> 23117.26s]  streams around and try to get them in and do this too why are you doing physical therapy because i
[23117.26s -> 23127.47s]  have costochondritis and i know i don't want to gross anybody out here but um i lean back
[23128.64s -> 23137.42s]  and stretch my rib cage a little and sort of tilt and move my chest it goes and it kind of hurts
[23138.41s -> 23141.85s]  it's and then it feels okay i look for a little bit it's like just kind of popping
[23141.85s -> 23149.72s]  weird it's pretty crunchy down there so costochondritis is inflammation in your rib cage
[23151.56s -> 23159.95s]  i just i was told it would make sense because i have um the colitis problems are autoimmune
[23160.83s -> 23164.75s]  and i was told that you know it's not out of the ordinary that for somebody that has
[23165.63s -> 23173.71s]  ibd which is autoimmune which is i've had it for years that something like this could pop up too
[23173.71s -> 23179.45s]  randomly because your body my body's just stupid and for some reason wants to attack itself
[23180.25s -> 23191.05s]  because i'm my body's dumb and i got a low iq fucking dna i don't understand i have now this
[23191.05s -> 23203.96s]  is like two potential autoimmune diseases which like what the fuck but uh going on physical
[23203.96s -> 23209.00s]  therapy i've been told helps a lot and in some cases can make the problem almost completely go
[23209.08s -> 23218.57s]  away we'll see i'm gonna give it a shot uh lm man thanks for the 10 bucks germa choo choo you
[23218.57s -> 23227.66s]  deserve a chew is that a space channel 5 reference sounds like it thanks for the thousand bits
[23229.21s -> 23235.55s]  ibuprofen is good for inflammation yeah i'm gonna give you some of my personal
[23236.43s -> 23246.25s]  um personal thoughts and personal beliefs here on this subject i don't want i don't like
[23246.25s -> 23254.27s]  here all right here we go i can go get an injection tomorrow into my nerve of steroids
[23254.27s -> 23261.29s]  and nerve blocker and i it might be i might be fine but i don't really like the idea of doing
[23261.29s -> 23267.32s]  that first and i don't like the idea of taking ibuprofen every day taking ibuprofen or tylenol
[23267.32s -> 23274.60s]  every day it's not it's really not great for you and i don't want to get into the habit of taking
[23274.60s -> 23279.76s]  three or four ibuprofen a day and saying man i feel this i feel fucking great i'm just going
[23279.76s -> 23285.74s]  to take four ibuprofen every day and then you're i'm essentially masking a problem that could be
[23285.74s -> 23292.20s]  fixed maybe potentially if i just did it and i don't really want to just use painkillers
[23292.20s -> 23300.14s]  to just put a blanket over a potential actual joint problem that i have that i could just
[23300.14s -> 23313.45s]  fix it's the same reason why i don't i really don't want to go on any like prescription pain
[23313.45s -> 23318.57s]  medicine i know that that's been floated around before of oh you you have like osteochondritis so
[23318.57s -> 23323.44s]  you have like joint problems you have a joint disease oh well you're gonna take vicodin you
[23323.44s -> 23328.17s]  know just a small dose every day no no i know i'm not gonna i'm not gonna do that i'm not gonna
[23328.17s -> 23336.27s]  take i'm not gonna take i'm not gonna take one i don't want to even do that and that's what i've
[23336.27s -> 23340.75s]  told the doctor and the doctor also said that's a good idea just we'll see what happens with
[23340.75s -> 23351.58s]  physical therapy let's see what happens now in the event that physical therapy does not work
[23352.92s -> 23362.17s]  you know let's say i do physical therapy for the next four to six months and there is no progress
[23362.17s -> 23366.35s]  and if it get worse it could get worse i don't know at that point it's like okay i've done
[23366.35s -> 23377.08s]  physical therapy for six months let's do the injection and see what happens that's the plan
[23377.08s -> 23388.88s]  now it could take a couple years yeah but uh there's not a layer here and okay here's the
[23388.88s -> 23397.04s]  here's the other layer i you know i got stuff to do every day you know it's not just the stream
[23397.60s -> 23401.37s]  i want to be like on this stream and not have to even think about it i want to be able to
[23401.37s -> 23406.89s]  interact and have fun and do whatever i want to do and have it in the back of your mind that like
[23406.89s -> 23412.01s]  oh my like whole fucking rib cage hurts it's i you know i don't want to have three four years
[23412.01s -> 23417.47s]  from now like that it would get really fucking annoying and it would just sit in the back of my
[23417.47s -> 23425.16s]  head always so i mean i'm eventually here over the next six to 12 months i've got to have a
[23425.16s -> 23431.61s]  real solution for this i don't want this to turn into an issue that's i'm just sitting here and
[23432.09s -> 23443.28s]  hey guys i'm gonna go to the grocery store today oh my my fucking chest hurts but it's not an issue
[23443.28s -> 23454.86s]  that's life-threatening or that would really really debilitate me it's just annoying my rib
[23454.86s -> 23462.19s]  cage sucks that's pretty much it and i but i just really i also have to live my life too i'm not
[23462.19s -> 23467.47s]  gonna i am not taking any pain medicine i'm not doing any treatments i'm just gonna be in pain
[23467.47s -> 23471.63s]  here every day and um yeah that's what eventually i'm gonna have to do something
[23471.63s -> 23480.24s]  if something like physical therapy doesn't work but that road is very very very far in the future
[23480.24s -> 23486.99s]  don't forget to do the stuff the physical therapist tells you to do at home i'm going to be
[23488.25s -> 23495.60s]  i'm gonna follow 100 percent of the instructions no matter what they are this physical therapist
[23495.60s -> 23503.18s]  could tell me you have to eat lettuce every day for the next year i'm gonna turn fucking green
[23503.18s -> 23516.40s]  i'm gonna turn fucking green you know what i mean you don't do that already i mean i eat lettuce
[23516.40s -> 23523.79s]  i like lettuce i like romaine lettuce is bros romaine lettuce okay to eat no and they recall

[23971.90s -> 23984.22s]  done you don't need very much how many sprays let's see uh how many sprays are in a bottle of cologne
[23987.69s -> 24005.12s]  735 sprays in a 50 milliliter bottle bottle so i don't wear cologne every day if i spray that once
[24006.08s -> 24012.80s]  even once a week or once every two weeks when i go out or something that's fucking 10 to 20 years
[24012.80s -> 24026.83s]  worth of cologne you don't need to use very much and sometimes and if you and by the way no that
[24026.83s -> 24033.68s]  is accurate that's very accurate because no you don't have one bottle of cologne i i have like
[24033.68s -> 24039.68s]  10 different bottles of cologne you use one for like a couple days week goes by use the next one
[24039.68s -> 24046.91s]  two weeks go by use the next one you you're always recycling colognes you don't do the same scent you
[24046.91s -> 24058.41s]  do a bunch you do like at least four or five of them to change it up who wears cologne i don't
[24059.05s -> 24065.47s]  this is my point my point is i wear cologne maybe once every like three to four weeks and i spray
[24065.55s -> 24080.70s]  one time so yes if i spray one spray a month that's 735 months what's the math there 735
[24080.70s -> 24090.92s]  divided by 12 let's see okay so i have 61 years worth of cologne that's not right what that's 60
[24090.92s -> 24096.68s]  yeah it is right okay i have 60 fucking years worth of cologne it's i don't know that's not
[24096.68s -> 24106.99s]  hard to understand you got to pass it down it's like whiskey you don't drink a bottle of nice
[24107.07s -> 24111.71s]  whiskey all in the same weekend i mean some of you guys might but fucking be careful for god's
[24111.71s -> 24127.04s]  sakes anyways where were we oh all right we're at germa sucks for five community subs thanks a lot

[24139.60s -> 24147.05s]  uh there is no eta on it but it's going to happen at some point before april because the marathon
[24147.05s -> 24159.40s]  is in april so we would need to do it before then so it's going to happen before april isn't
[24159.40s -> 24165.95s]  that an eta yeah i guess it is estimated time yeah before april that's not really a time that's more
[24165.95s -> 24173.16s]  of a estimated time to end it you know what i mean that that that's like it could it could be
[24173.16s -> 24180.41s]  tomorrow or it could be march 31st that's a huge time frame yeah that's not like an eta that's a
[24180.41s -> 24193.42s]  big giant time frame call it what you will for real though thanks for the 250 i don't know if
[24193.42s -> 24200.51s]  you're aware but the vermintide devs made a rats reference i actually did see this i did see the

[24231.00s -> 24239.32s]  from i was reading a few threads about this and apparently the rats that rats movie and the rat
[24239.32s -> 24243.40s]  clip there's a clip going around that's that people know what it is but people might not know
[24243.40s -> 24249.69s]  that it's from this channel from my understanding the rats have turned into their own thing that
[24249.69s -> 24260.49s]  aren't even connected to me anymore it's just thing and whatever it's you know the student
[24260.49s -> 24263.93s]  becomes the master as they say it's just going the rats don't need you though they don't need

[24278.89s -> 24282.81s]  that's fine whatever people can enjoy it that's why i did it that's why i said it in the first
[24282.81s -> 24288.11s]  place that's why i made the video so people could fucking think it was fun and use it and care about
[24288.11s -> 24300.84s]  it i think it was funny that was it so that good makes me happy sue them cease and desist so uh
[24300.84s -> 24307.80s]  you'd like me to cease and desist on the rats which is from a video game that i do not own

[24570.09s -> 24575.93s]  to go into this long explanation about what sort of sound he should make when he got stabbed i seem
[24575.93s -> 24583.21s]  to recall that i did say to peter have you any idea of what kind of noise happens when somebody
[24583.21s -> 24596.80s]  is stabbed in the back and i said because i do what the fuck holy shit it's because the breath

[24602.72s -> 24607.68s]  war two he used to be in the the british secret service whatever they were shit really he seemed
[24607.68s -> 24612.40s]  to have expert knowledge of exactly the sort of noise that they make and so i just sort of
[24612.96s -> 24616.64s]  didn't push the subject any further i just said well you obviously know what to do christopher
[24616.64s -> 24639.07s]  so i'm sure you'll do it great and he did that's fucking wild holy shit i didn't know that that's

[24941.76s -> 24946.80s]  it wasn't anything too freaky like you having sex on stream but anyway i was helping a school
[24946.80s -> 24953.02s]  throw out old textbooks and one of the textbooks was a germa 985 textbook it had outdated channel
[24953.02s -> 24962.09s]  memes and a whole chapter dedicated to explaining twitch chat also the textbook was tiny what an
[24962.09s -> 24970.96s]  odd book that book would not be very big the germa 985 textbook of what would okay the germa
[24970.96s -> 24979.96s]  985 textbook would be like a 30 page forward from me and then eight pages of actual content and 14

[25035.32s -> 25041.61s]  into older star wars games public commando is an underplayed fps classic the jedi night series or
[25041.61s -> 25045.71s]  force unleashed both have some good lightsaber stuff in there for you you can never go wrong
[25045.71s -> 25053.32s]  with playing 2005 battlefront 2 personally older cult classics make for more fun streams compared
[25053.32s -> 25065.80s]  to hot triple a titles that are mostly cut scenes keep on standing out yeah i mean i don't really
[25065.80s -> 25073.36s]  play the old games to necessarily try to do something different i just remember these being
[25073.36s -> 25082.67s]  crazy and fun and ridiculous i remember playing a lot of these and when we get on a string of
[25082.67s -> 25088.25s]  oh yeah i went and i grabbed 10 ps2 games that i remember playing that was i thought were crazy
[25088.25s -> 25100.88s]  i get to kind of relive it which is interesting too for me it's not that i'm trying to avoid
[25102.06s -> 25107.76s]  big new triple a titles it's just nothing's come out that's really
[25107.76s -> 25111.52s]  want grabbed my attention and made me want to play it for more than a minute
[25112.16s -> 25122.41s]  there's been some indie stuff you know those small not triple a budget games that we played on this
[25122.41s -> 25133.64s]  channel over the last year the phantom menace game is really bad but i love it yeah i remember
[25133.64s -> 25143.39s]  some of those i'm a bounty hunter was pretty fun outer wilds is amazing yeah but that's not a
[25143.39s -> 25149.55s]  necessarily a triple a experience i don't know if one comes along and i think it's
[25149.55s -> 25159.69s]  worth playing i'll do it or worth streaming is a better way to put that i agree atro locks atrox

[25258.80s -> 25268.30s]  but stay safe hopefully you can get out of that scenario in that environment sooner rather than

[25521.34s -> 25527.04s]  i think it was just overwhelming to me hey okay hold on let me i gotta i gotta rebuttal some of
[25527.04s -> 25532.96s]  these for you uh the lord of the rings games are just old and very very difficult just by their
[25532.96s -> 25536.56s]  nature so i'm gonna i'm gonna get frustrated at some points it's i mean doesn't mean i don't like
[25536.56s -> 25543.50s]  the game uh mountain blade war band overwhelmed me and uh i believe people in chat were calling me
[25543.50s -> 25548.86s]  like a stupid and an idiot and that i smelled and that my stream sucked uh so that was that one uh
[25548.86s -> 25551.90s]  i mean it was overwhelming a little bit halo reach was the worst stream of the year last year
[25551.90s -> 25558.28s]  because me and joel played it so i mean this is i didn't not hate these games
[25566.17s -> 25571.36s]  but i mean it's not like i would never mountain blade war band is just kind of not a game for me
[25572.44s -> 25577.32s]  it's a lot it's a kind of lot going on you have to pay attention to a ton of stuff at the same time
[25578.22s -> 25583.66s]  this it's like kind of like moving pieces on a big game board chat i you know that's kind of
[25583.66s -> 25593.31s]  just not my thing it's really really interesting and i i do love that people love that series
[25595.04s -> 25605.80s]  joel ruined halo no it really did i'm uh the honesty is the best policy let's use it here
[25606.73s -> 25611.45s]  i mean they like ruined all halo for me like all of halo not that stream but just that the idea of
[25611.45s -> 25617.82s]  that gap was that ruined every halo game i can't play halo ever again it has nothing to do with
[25617.82s -> 25622.22s]  it has nothing to do with joe it has nothing to do with joe he didn't do anything out of the
[25622.22s -> 25628.76s]  ordinary it's just like that stream i just like i can never play halo ever again it has nothing
[25628.76s -> 25640.04s]  to do with joe god damn it joe ps you should play warhammer 40k dawn of war one that's literally

[25853.28s -> 25863.05s]  cut out uh replace like three or four drinks a day that you drink normally with water helps also

[25904.30s -> 25916.91s]  advice from the 1950s um eat less cheese increase your garlic intake and drink water is that's just
[25916.91s -> 25931.34s]  like hey you want to be a healthy motherfucker or not uh dr house even says don't eat cheese
