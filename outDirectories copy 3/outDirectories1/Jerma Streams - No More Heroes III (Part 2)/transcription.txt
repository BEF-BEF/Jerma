[5.30s -> 7.46s]  Dude, I just took a big sip out of my coffee.
[9.24s -> 12.84s]  It was a huge mistake. Just a massive mistake.
[13.48s -> 17.34s]  Because I didn't stir it enough. I stirred it a little bit.
[19.18s -> 24.58s]  And the creamer that I put in went to the bottom and I sucked up pretty much like
[24.58s -> 29.22s]  30% of the cream that I put in. So now my cream ratio is ruined.
[29.86s -> 33.38s]  I had this perfect. I didn't stir it enough.
[34.90s -> 39.30s]  God. That's a real sad, sad emote scenario, I think.
[41.64s -> 43.72s]  Spit it back out. He's already swallowed it.
[47.34s -> 49.82s]  And there's some new, there were some new random emotes.
[51.00s -> 55.30s]  We're testing out a couple of them. This German window, is there now?
[56.74s -> 61.75s]  I might just make that official. I was thinking about, because there's animated emotes now.
[63.19s -> 67.56s]  I was like, hmm. I was thinking maybe I could have like me jumping out of the window as an
[67.56s -> 71.35s]  animated emote. So we're going to give it a trial run here. This one is just free.
[71.99s -> 76.86s]  See how people like it. I don't want to do German TV again.
[76.86s -> 80.39s]  So because that is never used and it's just still there.
[80.39s -> 86.52s]  Upside, yeah, we're gonna play No More Heroes 3 again today.
[87.08s -> 90.86s]  Continuing the journey through the game. I don't think I'm going to beat it today.
[91.50s -> 94.95s]  We're going to go the same amount of time, I think.
[94.95s -> 98.55s]  Somewhere between like five, four and a half to like six hours or something.
[99.93s -> 106.34s]  Very, I want to play. I wanted to get into it, but I doubt I will see the end.
[106.34s -> 112.26s]  So we will finish this next weekend after today and after WarioWare.
[112.74s -> 117.85s]  This WarioWare comes out on the 10th. So you bet your ass that on the 10th
[117.85s -> 123.08s]  we're going to play WarioWare. And on the 11th, probably No More Heroes 3. Finish it up.
[123.08s -> 126.70s]  I mean, I'm just on the Switch. So that makes a lot of sense.
[126.70s -> 132.38s]  German TV is my most used emote, German Punching.
[132.38s -> 134.30s]  German Punching should be, maybe should be official too.
[137.43s -> 139.43s]  I got a tweet. I'll be right back.
[139.43s -> 193.82s]  I'm also realizing the title right now for a lot of you.
[193.82s -> 197.74s]  Probably just like, what the fuck is he doing? That's the seal.
[197.74s -> 199.58s]  I don't know. I couldn't think of what to write.
[199.58s -> 204.92s]  I couldn't think of anything to put on the title because it's just playing No More Heroes.
[204.92s -> 212.58s]  So I couldn't, whatever. Sometimes this titles that makes sense.
[212.58s -> 217.72s]  I didn't have one. What about the sunflowers?
[219.66s -> 221.50s]  Yeah, yeah, maybe you'll see those tomorrow.
[226.95s -> 232.42s]  I'm just kidding. Yeah, I've got, I've got a full spread of images to show you today.
[234.60s -> 242.78s]  Green Thumb Andy. You'll see those eventually.
[242.78s -> 247.06s]  I got to find a way to put those in and just stall somewhere in the stream.
[247.14s -> 248.82s]  I don't, I don't want to do it right now.
[248.82s -> 254.38s]  I want to wait till there's 25,000 people, concurrent viewers here today to do that.
[256.34s -> 260.98s]  So, I mean, I'm not, I am not going to show the sunflowers until I have 25,000 viewers.
[261.62s -> 264.23s]  So, I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.
[269.53s -> 272.57s]  No, I will do it in like a few minutes. I'm just kidding.
[272.57s -> 275.40s]  I'm not going to hit 25,000 viewers.
[280.47s -> 283.75s]  It's 12,000 people with two eyes. Holy shit.
[285.19s -> 287.59s]  That is a, that's a next level take, I think.
[288.23s -> 291.35s]  You're going to max out at 12,000.
[292.47s -> 294.71s]  If that, I don't know. I don't think so.
[303.99s -> 305.03s]  Yes, you will. Well, we'll see.
[305.03s -> 312.15s]  Because if I do, then you get to see some of the sunflowers.
[312.15s -> 314.07s]  I'm very excited to play this again.
[314.07s -> 322.65s]  Do it now.
[322.65s -> 323.61s]  No, we got to wait.
[323.61s -> 325.37s]  A lot of people have been waiting to see these sunflowers.
[327.00s -> 329.88s]  So, they might not, they just, maybe they just got the notification.
[329.88s -> 331.56s]  Maybe they're eating, maybe they're just hanging out.
[331.56s -> 332.92s]  I don't know.
[332.92s -> 335.56s]  Okay, we're going to wait till like at least 10 to 20 minutes into the stream.
[338.10s -> 340.10s]  Last thing we did was,
[341.06s -> 343.38s]  I just beat the ninja.
[344.02s -> 346.34s]  It's the last thing that happened.
[346.34s -> 349.45s]  And we just kind of stood right here.
[354.36s -> 355.80s]  This is Persona.
[355.80s -> 358.28s]  This is no more heroes free.
[358.92s -> 363.16s]  Twitch mobile notifications take about 20 minutes to send.
[363.16s -> 364.52s]  Yeah, so we got time.
[364.52s -> 373.40s]  You won't play the spin-off.
[375.32s -> 376.52s]  We have new clothes.
[376.52s -> 380.44s]  We already had this.
[381.16s -> 384.47s]  I actually really like this.
[385.11s -> 387.64s]  Got a good message on it too.
[387.64s -> 394.47s]  I really, I like the black hoodie and the black pants.
[395.11s -> 400.57s]  Yeah, we're going to wait.
[400.57s -> 403.00s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to see what else is there.
[403.64s -> 405.85s]  Let me see what else is there.
[409.67s -> 411.51s]  You have a hoodie that just says, fuck.
[416.82s -> 418.74s]  I think you need to load in a little more.
[418.74s -> 422.94s]  Let's see what, I got like two, three other shirts though.
[422.94s -> 434.81s]  I actually, I like that one too.
[434.81s -> 442.20s]  That shirt's actually merch of a band.
[442.20s -> 443.00s]  Really?
[443.00s -> 449.53s]  Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[457.02s -> 457.90s]  Didn't I get something else?
[457.90s -> 458.78s]  I thought I got something else.
[460.09s -> 462.90s]  I thought I had another shirt.
[462.90s -> 465.46s]  No, I wore kill, kill, kill, kill, kill already.
[465.46s -> 469.77s]  I like that hoodie.
[469.77s -> 470.73s]  I want to put it on.
[470.73s -> 478.39s]  Let's go for it.
[478.39s -> 485.05s]  I want most of these shirts IRL.
[485.13s -> 488.33s]  I mean, what's the term?
[489.30s -> 492.50s]  What's the term for like, look at how awesome these, the good clothes.
[493.38s -> 494.42s]  Shirts, the pants.
[494.42s -> 497.93s]  What is it?
[497.93s -> 500.01s]  No more racists three.
[500.01s -> 506.01s]  It's called Drip.
[509.37s -> 513.26s]  I feel like in all the pseudo games, there's lots of that.
[513.26s -> 535.14s]  You didn't wipe?
[535.14s -> 536.10s]  No slang Andy.
[536.82s -> 538.26s]  Why would I have slang?
[538.26s -> 540.26s]  I'm like 20 years older than you.
[540.26s -> 543.90s]  You know what my slang was?
[543.90s -> 545.42s]  It was fucking radical.
[547.74s -> 550.44s]  Totally tubular.
[550.44s -> 554.42s]  You would punch me in the mouth if I said that to you, wouldn't you?
[554.42s -> 557.40s]  That's totally tubular.
[557.40s -> 559.16s]  Like you would punch me in the face immediately.
[559.16s -> 561.48s]  And like, I don't want to, why would I want someone to do that to me?
[561.48s -> 572.06s]  51, what's with the 51?
[572.06s -> 575.94s]  51 Ronin, 51 grams.
[575.94s -> 578.04s]  Oh, it's pseudo 51.
[578.04s -> 578.36s]  Okay.
[578.36s -> 579.98s]  But like, whatever.
[581.66s -> 582.70s]  Whatever.
[582.70s -> 583.66s]  All right, let's do it.
[583.66s -> 584.70s]  We got to go to Perfect World.
[593.86s -> 595.46s]  The sus guy has really changed.
[597.10s -> 598.22s]  No, he hasn't.
[598.22s -> 599.10s]  You've changed.
[601.59s -> 606.07s]  Your perspective on how you feel about me has changed because you've changed.
[617.27s -> 619.19s]  Anti-Aliasing Andy.
[619.19s -> 621.03s]  Well, I didn't make this game, so don't worry.
[624.50s -> 625.86s]  I didn't unclog this toilet.
[633.78s -> 634.58s]  You've changed.
[635.14s -> 638.46s]  He's got Drip.
[638.46s -> 648.49s]  The sus guy literally did the face like five days ago.
[649.53s -> 650.25s]  That's me.
[650.25s -> 651.13s]  Just say I did it.
[658.78s -> 659.98s]  We're waiting for the sunflowers.
[659.98s -> 661.10s]  Yeah, they're coming.
[661.10s -> 661.58s]  Don't worry.
[662.06s -> 662.86s]  You'll see them soon.
[665.61s -> 667.45s]  It's actually, it's going to be like really cool.
[668.01s -> 669.77s]  I did like a, you'll see.
[670.65s -> 680.54s]  I had a professional editor edit the photos.
[681.34s -> 683.05s]  We're professionally done.
[684.17s -> 685.05s]  I feel like I'm fucking around.
[697.37s -> 698.97s]  I'm watching this while taking a shit.
[700.65s -> 701.74s]  That's based.
[702.62s -> 707.05s]  You see, when I say it, you don't like it.
[707.05s -> 709.11s]  You think it sounds weird, right?
[710.65s -> 713.77s]  If somebody in your Discord call right now says it, you think that they're cool.
[714.41s -> 716.17s]  Do you understand how this works?
[716.17s -> 717.61s]  I'm too, I'm way older than you.
[718.17s -> 724.68s]  I got to save it.
[730.63s -> 732.07s]  No, that saying is just dumb.
[732.95s -> 737.82s]  Is it Scorpion?
[737.82s -> 738.94s]  Ooh, I'll get it.
[738.94s -> 745.69s]  You just got plus 10 social credit for that one.
[748.73s -> 749.93s]  Why do I save so much?
[752.46s -> 753.98s]  It just goes back to like the old days.
[754.78s -> 755.34s]  Oh, there is one.
[755.34s -> 755.90s]  Okay.
[755.90s -> 759.50s]  The old days of video games when you didn't save, you got screwed over.
[766.22s -> 767.02s]  That was terrifying.
[767.02s -> 767.52s]  Why?
[777.77s -> 780.49s]  Oh, that deserves a Monka W.
[781.91s -> 784.55s]  Is Monka W or Monka W?
[785.11s -> 785.61s]  W.
[786.23s -> 788.92s]  It's Monka W or W.
[789.64s -> 790.66s]  What do you guys prefer?
[792.01s -> 794.25s]  Oh, Monka W or Monka W.
[796.28s -> 797.48s]  Oh, oh, Monka W.
[798.28s -> 798.94s]  Which one?
[799.50s -> 804.95s]  First one?
[805.51s -> 806.71s]  I'd probably say the first one, you know?
[809.90s -> 810.86s]  All right, let me go to the highway.
[825.78s -> 826.66s]  This map is big.
[827.38s -> 830.50s]  There's fast travel.
[830.50s -> 831.00s]  Is there?
[838.68s -> 839.24s]  Well, I'm right here.
[842.44s -> 843.40s]  Yeah, there is.
[844.04s -> 849.18s]  Perfect world.
[849.18s -> 850.79s]  Oh, there is fast travel.
[853.24s -> 853.88s]  Oh, shit.
[853.88s -> 854.68s]  Okay.
[854.68s -> 855.48s]  I kind of like the...
[855.48s -> 857.48s]  I like driving around because I like to do the random things, though.
[857.48s -> 861.38s]  I don't want to get just used to this.
[861.38s -> 863.30s]  Hurry, please show the sunflowers.
[863.30s -> 866.26s]  Yeah, I'm going to show the sunflowers in exactly five minutes.
[867.64s -> 871.78s]  T minus five minutes for the showing of the sunflowers.
[871.78s -> 875.27s]  I'm going to go over the entire thing.
[875.27s -> 877.51s]  I'm going to tell you everything about it, the process,
[878.23s -> 880.92s]  internalizing everything and seeing how things play out.
[883.53s -> 884.09s]  All right, here we go.
[885.38s -> 887.30s]  Now, do designated matches.
[887.30s -> 888.02s]  Cool.
[888.02s -> 889.38s]  I just upgraded a bunch of shit, too.
[893.75s -> 894.63s]  Sunflower stream.
[894.63s -> 895.19s]  Let's go.
[895.19s -> 895.91s]  Yep, let's go.
[901.80s -> 902.60s]  Oh, this is a blue fight?
[902.60s -> 903.10s]  Yep.
[903.64s -> 904.60s]  All right, let's get back into this.
[904.60s -> 910.81s]  Everybody's having a good weekend.
[910.81s -> 911.77s]  How's your weekend going?
[911.77s -> 912.57s]  I didn't even ask you.
[923.05s -> 923.55s]  Good?
[924.01s -> 924.73s]  What's stalling?
[924.73s -> 925.37s]  I'm playing the game.
[925.37s -> 926.17s]  I'm not even stalling.
[929.29s -> 931.93s]  Your perception of me stalling is what's changed.
[931.93s -> 932.81s]  I didn't change anything.
[932.81s -> 933.45s]  I didn't do anything.
[942.82s -> 944.18s]  Oh, I thought I was a super bug.
[944.74s -> 945.38s]  I hate these guys.
[945.38s -> 946.10s]  They're the worst in the game.
[948.87s -> 950.55s]  Oh, I have these new moves.
[951.27s -> 952.31s]  Holy shit.
[952.31s -> 954.39s]  This makes this game so much more ridiculous.
[959.03s -> 959.83s]  Like, holy shit.
[965.13s -> 966.65s]  Those moves make this game...
[966.65s -> 969.13s]  I don't want to say easier, but I want to say maybe.
[970.09s -> 979.94s]  I'm watching a scary video at the same time as this.
[979.94s -> 980.44s]  Why?
[980.82s -> 984.02s]  I'm watching a scary video?
[984.90s -> 985.38s]  What was that?
[985.38s -> 986.34s]  You did pay attention here.
[986.98s -> 989.71s]  Here we go.
[990.17s -> 996.41s]  Do I remember all the No More Heroes 2 bosses?
[996.41s -> 1001.24s]  I mean, you told me that if I could name all the No More Heroes 2 bosses
[1001.24s -> 1003.16s]  in the next five minutes without Google,
[1003.16s -> 1004.52s]  that you'd give me a million dollars.
[1004.52s -> 1005.40s]  I wouldn't be able to do it,
[1005.40s -> 1007.32s]  but I remember a couple of them, maybe.
[1007.32s -> 1022.38s]  The fake fan.
[1025.42s -> 1029.85s]  For a second, I thought something was wrong with this bench.
[1029.85s -> 1031.69s]  I thought it was pushed up.
[1032.25s -> 1034.87s]  I was like, what's wrong with this thing?
[1034.87s -> 1039.99s]  I thought it was one continuous piece of furniture.
[1039.99s -> 1050.86s]  This dude's zonked.
[1050.86s -> 1051.50s]  Shh.
[1051.50s -> 1057.78s]  Two minutes until sunflowers.
[1057.78s -> 1060.30s]  Yeah, we're getting there.
[1061.10s -> 1071.66s]  Name all 151 Pokemon.
[1071.66s -> 1074.64s]  Ars Art.
[1075.34s -> 1076.59s]  Squirtle.
[1079.16s -> 1079.66s]  Man Champ.
[1086.73s -> 1087.23s]  No Toad.
[1087.77s -> 1090.34s]  No, that's Futurama.
[1090.34s -> 1091.70s]  All right, I have to stop.
[1092.10s -> 1092.90s]  I got to pay attention.
[1105.78s -> 1106.90s]  These moves are so good.
[1113.75s -> 1114.39s]  I hate this dude.
[1124.46s -> 1125.10s]  How did I miss?
[1125.98s -> 1127.75s]  You know what's really hard to do?
[1128.47s -> 1131.99s]  Holding left trigger and then having to hit hold left bumper
[1131.99s -> 1133.11s]  to do the special moves.
[1133.11s -> 1135.91s]  I guess that's by design because you can't just do them.
[1137.11s -> 1137.83s]  Yeah, I get it.
[1138.71s -> 1140.34s]  Favorite enemy type so far?
[1143.69s -> 1145.53s]  I like the sword guys.
[1145.53s -> 1146.25s]  Like the ninjas.
[1147.13s -> 1156.70s]  Good dog.
[1157.34s -> 1159.51s]  I'm gonna get double killed right here.
[1160.15s -> 1160.47s]  Nice.
[1160.47s -> 1161.83s]  All right, that just saved me a shitload of time.
[1172.06s -> 1173.34s]  10 seconds until sunflowers.
[1177.02s -> 1177.76s]  Did they come?
[1179.80s -> 1182.62s]  Okay, so let's talk about the sunflowers.
[1183.75s -> 1184.95s]  I know for some of you this is a big deal.
[1184.95s -> 1186.39s]  For some of you, you don't care at all.
[1187.27s -> 1188.31s]  It's not gonna take very long.
[1188.31s -> 1189.51s]  Maybe like 10 minutes or so.
[1190.15s -> 1193.96s]  Let's get to a pause menu.
[1197.34s -> 1200.81s]  So a few months ago, I decided
[1201.45s -> 1202.44s]  that I wanted to...
[1202.44s -> 1202.84s]  Well, hold on.
[1202.84s -> 1203.88s]  I can't talk over the cut scene.
[1221.98s -> 1223.61s]  This is a Metal Gear joke.
[1224.25s -> 1225.75s]  Where is he?
[1226.39s -> 1231.78s]  It's me.
[1232.34s -> 1233.51s]  I'm here.
[1234.23s -> 1235.43s]  Where are you?
[1236.07s -> 1238.82s]  Oh, can't you see me?
[1239.78s -> 1241.38s]  That means it's not time just yet.
[1242.10s -> 1247.14s]  Does that mean exactly what I said?
[1248.02s -> 1249.30s]  You are not yet prepared.
[1250.10s -> 1251.70s]  Stop screwing around.
[1255.06s -> 1256.50s]  You harbor doubts, don't you?
[1257.06s -> 1259.54s]  With regard to me and yourself.
[1260.79s -> 1261.29s]  Myself.
[1262.25s -> 1263.53s]  Okay, that was awful.
[1263.53s -> 1264.41s]  I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[1264.41s -> 1266.09s]  That last one was fucking terrible.
[1266.09s -> 1268.97s]  That was like TikTok cringe compilation.
[1268.97s -> 1269.93s]  Levels of bad.
[1269.93s -> 1271.05s]  I'm done with this.
[1271.05s -> 1271.37s]  That's it.
[1271.37s -> 1272.41s]  We're moving past this one.
[1272.97s -> 1275.18s]  Your past.
[1275.18s -> 1276.06s]  Is it really yours?
[1276.86s -> 1279.45s]  What about your memories?
[1281.40s -> 1282.12s]  Your body?
[1282.68s -> 1283.40s]  Your mind?
[1285.74s -> 1286.94s]  Enough with the riddles.
[1290.51s -> 1293.21s]  I'll give you one more.
[1298.60s -> 1301.84s]  I'm me.
[1302.48s -> 1305.44s]  But am I really?
[1311.55s -> 1313.55s]  Once you begin to doubt, there is no end.
[1315.71s -> 1316.27s]  Aunt May?
[1320.27s -> 1321.87s]  That deserves a sip of coffee with me.
[1322.51s -> 1324.11s]  I just stabbed myself in the fucking mouth.
[1324.11s -> 1324.35s]  Ow.
[1324.91s -> 1325.63s]  With the straw.
[1326.19s -> 1326.75s]  I'm bleeding.
[1327.87s -> 1328.67s]  Fucking hold on.
[1329.88s -> 1332.60s]  Yeah, I just like stabbed myself right in the mouth with the straw.
[1334.92s -> 1336.36s]  Yeah, like underneath my lip.
[1337.00s -> 1338.92s]  Like where my teeth meet.
[1338.92s -> 1339.80s]  Matt, you know what I mean?
[1342.32s -> 1347.85s]  It looks like it's fine.
[1347.85s -> 1348.97s]  It's not that bad.
[1348.97s -> 1352.38s]  I just, I hit the straw and it hit my teeth
[1353.10s -> 1356.54s]  and the upper part of my kind of gum lip area.
[1356.86s -> 1358.94s]  They both connected and it pinched.
[1359.58s -> 1363.68s]  I'm never doing a snake impression ever again.
[1363.68s -> 1364.40s]  That's what caused this.
[1365.90s -> 1366.22s]  Okay.
[1367.02s -> 1368.22s]  But here we go.
[1368.22s -> 1369.58s]  Once you begin to doubt, there's no end.
[1369.58s -> 1371.42s]  But once the seed of doubt has been planted,
[1372.91s -> 1374.19s]  call an ambulance.
[1374.19s -> 1376.51s]  Oh no, I bit my tongue.
[1377.31s -> 1378.59s]  I didn't need an ambulance.
[1379.15s -> 1381.28s]  That seed takes root and begins to grow
[1381.28s -> 1382.80s]  and becomes as you are now.
[1383.44s -> 1385.72s]  What are you trying to say about me?
[1386.36s -> 1387.40s]  We'll meet again.
[1388.28s -> 1388.68s]  Soon.
[1389.48s -> 1396.28s]  To be continued.
[1396.28s -> 1402.36s]  Stop stalling.
[1402.36s -> 1403.32s]  I just had to get away from that
[1403.32s -> 1404.52s]  and I can take and pause the game.
[1413.64s -> 1415.24s]  Is this the doy doy doy guy?
[1415.88s -> 1416.36s]  You know what?
[1416.92s -> 1419.05s]  You know, I've been in other fucking TV shows.
[1421.13s -> 1424.49s]  I've had multi-million dollar television shows produced.
[1425.05s -> 1426.81s]  I've been in 10 different movies.
[1426.81s -> 1428.25s]  I won two Academy Awards,
[1430.80s -> 1432.56s]  but I'm the doy doy doy guy.
[1433.80s -> 1434.04s]  Yes.
[1434.68s -> 1436.76s]  Five years ago, I made a sound on stream.
[1437.32s -> 1439.74s]  You know how many other things I've done?
[1440.30s -> 1450.81s]  Hollywood Andy.
[1450.81s -> 1451.93s]  All right, let's do some flowers.
[1452.49s -> 1456.00s]  But you do it a lot.
[1456.56s -> 1457.12s]  Yeah, I do.
[1458.94s -> 1459.26s]  All right.
[1459.26s -> 1460.46s]  So the following.
[1461.93s -> 1462.81s]  Get excited.
[1462.81s -> 1463.53s]  Are you ready?
[1463.53s -> 1470.25s]  So a few months ago, the idea crossed the mind
[1470.25s -> 1472.49s]  to plant some sunflowers.
[1472.49s -> 1477.00s]  I actually learned a lot about gardening and planting.
[1477.00s -> 1478.52s]  It's something I've never really done before.
[1481.37s -> 1485.05s]  You don't just put things in a pot and just water them.
[1485.05s -> 1488.30s]  There's a lot of things that go into the first
[1488.30s -> 1490.30s]  like two or three weeks of growing flowers
[1490.30s -> 1493.26s]  that I just had no idea, especially sunflowers.
[1493.26s -> 1497.76s]  So the following images you will see on your screen
[1497.84s -> 1503.20s]  are that process.
[1503.20s -> 1505.53s]  And this is not just one picture.
[1505.53s -> 1507.93s]  This is multiple images over the course of the entire life.
[1507.93s -> 1512.70s]  So the first one you're going to see, which is pretty cool.
[1512.70s -> 1515.52s]  This is the pot.
[1515.52s -> 1518.80s]  And this is like right, maybe like, I don't know,
[1518.80s -> 1519.84s]  a week after planting.
[1519.84s -> 1524.30s]  And you're probably noticing there's a lot of little guys here.
[1524.30s -> 1529.31s]  He's grown his own weed.
[1529.31s -> 1530.59s]  No, no, not no.
[1532.59s -> 1536.51s]  When you grow sunflowers or any kind of big plant like this,
[1536.51s -> 1538.97s]  they sort of fight to get to choose
[1538.97s -> 1540.65s]  who gets to be the one that lives.
[1540.65s -> 1541.77s]  It's pretty sad in a way.
[1543.69s -> 1547.82s]  Because after you germinate them and you put them in the ground,
[1547.82s -> 1550.14s]  you have to thin them.
[1550.14s -> 1554.67s]  And you get to watch which ones are the strong ones.
[1554.67s -> 1557.47s]  And they're the ones that kind of get to stick around,
[1557.47s -> 1562.27s]  which it's sad because you'll end up with scenarios like this
[1562.27s -> 1564.76s]  where this one's coming up.
[1564.76s -> 1565.96s]  It's like, oh, he's so strong.
[1565.96s -> 1567.00s]  He's so big.
[1567.00s -> 1567.72s]  And look at him.
[1567.72s -> 1569.05s]  He looks perfect.
[1569.05s -> 1573.18s]  But the one next to him can't be there.
[1573.18s -> 1578.62s]  So even though the one next to him is growing and looking good,
[1578.62s -> 1582.68s]  he's going to have to go.
[1582.68s -> 1584.52s]  Because you have to, with sunflowers,
[1584.52s -> 1588.62s]  I believe it's at least six to eight inches apart
[1588.62s -> 1592.12s]  to have them have their roots be OK.
[1592.12s -> 1597.34s]  Yeah, it was a sad process of watching them all kind of do this.
[1597.34s -> 1601.04s]  And as you see, here they come.
[1601.04s -> 1602.40s]  And you see the ones on the right?
[1602.40s -> 1603.90s]  That's the seed.
[1603.90s -> 1606.75s]  That's the sunflower seed still on it.
[1606.75s -> 1608.03s]  It stays on.
[1608.03s -> 1611.74s]  And then eventually it falls off and they spread out.
[1611.74s -> 1613.18s]  And that's how they look like then.
[1613.18s -> 1617.82s]  So after a couple more weeks,
[1617.82s -> 1622.01s]  this is probably like maybe two and a half weeks, two weeks.
[1622.01s -> 1626.36s]  The ones that get the tallest forced Darwinism.
[1630.41s -> 1631.93s]  It's called thinning.
[1631.93s -> 1633.93s]  It's not full.
[1634.49s -> 1637.95s]  They look like in-game screenshots.
[1637.95s -> 1639.71s]  Well, they've been like they've been edited
[1639.71s -> 1645.05s]  to look a little nicer and to accentuate sort of the important stuff.
[1645.05s -> 1648.67s]  It's thinning.
[1649.15s -> 1654.68s]  No, you have to understand if you just they can't survive like this
[1654.68s -> 1658.38s]  and you don't know which is going to be a strong seed
[1658.38s -> 1660.46s]  because you don't know because when you put it in the case.
[1660.46s -> 1661.98s]  So some of them don't come up at all.
[1661.98s -> 1669.42s]  So when you plant 10 to 20 of them, five of them might not even come up.
[1670.44s -> 1675.96s]  So if you just plant one or two and they never show up,
[1675.96s -> 1677.08s]  you don't have a harvest.
[1677.08s -> 1679.16s]  You don't have a plant.
[1679.16s -> 1680.36s]  So you have to do it like this.
[1680.36s -> 1681.16s]  Otherwise, you don't know.
[1681.16s -> 1687.61s]  This is another image of it.
[1687.61s -> 1690.76s]  And at this point, it was hard to tell.
[1690.76s -> 1692.12s]  At this point here, it's like, all right.
[1692.12s -> 1695.42s]  So who's going to be the real the ones that are going to grow big and strong?
[1695.42s -> 1700.65s]  You can see some of them that look like they're a little bit hardier than others.
[1700.65s -> 1703.69s]  And this is after some of them have already been removed at this point.
[1703.69s -> 1716.08s]  If you can zoom in here, some of these have actually been removed already.
[1716.08s -> 1718.72s]  Down here, it was one or two that were removed
[1718.72s -> 1720.80s]  because they just weren't really coming up at all.
[1720.80s -> 1721.92s]  They were stuck.
[1721.92s -> 1725.05s]  They were kind of wilty.
[1725.05s -> 1726.89s]  Would we survive in your society?
[1733.92s -> 1736.56s]  This is basic gardening 101.
[1738.38s -> 1739.50s]  I am not like...
[1739.50s -> 1741.10s]  What are you talking about?
[1741.10s -> 1742.86s]  This is basic gardening.
[1749.82s -> 1753.36s]  Eventually, after they've been thinned a few times,
[1753.36s -> 1754.72s]  and some of them were stronger.
[1754.72s -> 1756.48s]  Some of them were strong enough, actually.
[1756.48s -> 1760.96s]  So as you see in the right pot, there are four.
[1761.98s -> 1764.46s]  The four were able to kind of stick around.
[1764.46s -> 1767.71s]  And also, notice the two over here.
[1767.71s -> 1770.92s]  These were taken out of the pot on the right
[1770.92s -> 1772.68s]  because they looked healthy enough.
[1772.68s -> 1774.52s]  And I just, I don't know, just felt bad.
[1774.52s -> 1775.82s]  I didn't want to just...
[1775.82s -> 1778.46s]  If they were strong, then I wanted them to survive.
[1778.46s -> 1779.42s]  So they got their own pot.
[1780.38s -> 1782.94s]  Actually, like three or four of these,
[1782.94s -> 1786.76s]  besides the one on screen, were repotted.
[1786.76s -> 1789.64s]  If I have to give you a real number of the seedlings,
[1789.64s -> 1793.24s]  maybe like three or four, maybe five total didn't make it.
[1793.24s -> 1796.62s]  The other ones were repotted and were given as gifts.
[1796.62s -> 1802.68s]  It was like, hey, here's like a kind of young sunflower.
[1802.68s -> 1803.48s]  Do you want it?
[1803.48s -> 1806.60s]  You can have it.
[1806.60s -> 1809.72s]  It's like watching your child go off to college in a weird way.
[1809.72s -> 1811.18s]  It's like, okay, here you go.
[1811.18s -> 1812.62s]  I've taken care of them for so long,
[1812.62s -> 1815.18s]  but make sure you give them plenty of water
[1815.18s -> 1817.82s]  and plenty of sunshine, make sure you aim them at the sun.
[1817.82s -> 1820.92s]  And make sure they eat every day.
[1820.92s -> 1822.60s]  It's like watching your kid go to school,
[1822.60s -> 1826.88s]  or like off to college or something.
[1826.88s -> 1830.57s]  But eventually, as you see the ones in the pot on the right,
[1830.57s -> 1834.09s]  they're about six to eight inches apart.
[1834.09s -> 1835.40s]  So they're good.
[1835.40s -> 1837.40s]  Very healthy, growing, strong.
[1837.40s -> 1839.68s]  This is where it gets interesting.
[1839.68s -> 1841.96s]  See what that is?
[1841.96s -> 1845.95s]  I'll zoom in on you.
[1845.95s -> 1854.60s]  A little praying mantis baby decided to sit up here and stay here.
[1854.60s -> 1860.94s]  And there's an interesting story about this praying mantis.
[1860.94s -> 1866.43s]  They never left.
[1866.43s -> 1868.91s]  And you'll see maybe a few images later.
[1868.91s -> 1876.35s]  Maybe you'll see this little friend again.
[1876.35s -> 1879.10s]  And the best part about the praying mantis
[1879.10s -> 1880.78s]  was this guy controlled a lot.
[1880.78s -> 1885.36s]  We're talking about like if they have this aphid problems, right?
[1886.32s -> 1889.92s]  It's really, really easy when you have this just guard dog
[1889.92s -> 1893.20s]  that's here constantly.
[1893.20s -> 1894.32s]  That was kind of an issue too.
[1894.32s -> 1895.12s]  He's trying to figure out like,
[1895.12s -> 1896.48s]  huh, I don't want to use pesticides.
[1896.48s -> 1900.35s]  So how do you naturally take care of the leaves?
[1900.35s -> 1901.15s]  I don't want aphids.
[1901.15s -> 1902.83s]  I don't want like the spider mites.
[1902.83s -> 1905.18s]  So having to come up with a solution of,
[1905.18s -> 1908.62s]  oh, you can like make your own like organic insecticide spray.
[1908.62s -> 1910.70s]  It's like light soap and peppermint.
[1911.98s -> 1915.36s]  And it actually, it works pretty well.
[1915.36s -> 1917.92s]  And yes, this praying mantis will be in the next German rumble.
[1919.34s -> 1920.06s]  That's a guarantee.
[1920.62s -> 1929.55s]  This is where they started to actually form leaves.
[1930.11s -> 1932.99s]  As you see, they look weird too.
[1932.99s -> 1936.06s]  It's an insane process.
[1936.06s -> 1936.86s]  Look at that.
[1936.86s -> 1939.71s]  Doesn't it look like she's going to open up
[1939.71s -> 1941.47s]  and just spit acid in my face?
[1941.47s -> 1945.26s]  And they were very healthy too.
[1945.26s -> 1946.14s]  They were very healthy.
[1946.14s -> 1946.86s]  They were very strong.
[1946.86s -> 1951.29s]  But the problem was it's really windy in Vegas
[1951.29s -> 1954.46s]  and these things grow these long stalks.
[1954.46s -> 1957.64s]  So do you know how many times there was like
[1957.64s -> 1959.32s]  15 plus mile per hour winds here?
[1959.88s -> 1962.04s]  And the panic that ensued of trying to make sure
[1962.04s -> 1963.24s]  they weren't going to get blown over.
[1963.24s -> 1970.22s]  There were storms.
[1970.22s -> 1971.66s]  There were big winds.
[1971.66s -> 1973.26s]  It was just like, shit, okay.
[1973.26s -> 1975.02s]  Just shimmy it behind like a wall.
[1977.82s -> 1979.58s]  When it got to this point, this is like,
[1979.58s -> 1983.37s]  I never thought I was ever going to be able to see this.
[1983.37s -> 1985.74s]  I thought I was going to screw something up.
[1985.74s -> 1987.82s]  There was so many opportunities to like break them
[1987.82s -> 1990.38s]  or damage them or weather problems.
[1991.26s -> 1995.36s]  I was like, holy shit, they're actually going to open.
[1995.36s -> 1998.09s]  And eventually another probably,
[1998.09s -> 2000.73s]  and this is probably about two months at this point,
[2000.73s -> 2001.93s]  maybe two and a half months.
[2001.93s -> 2005.74s]  Eventually they opened.
[2005.74s -> 2009.64s]  And this is what he looks like after opening.
[2010.12s -> 2011.68s]  So there you go.
[2011.68s -> 2013.84s]  There's your sunflower picture.
[2016.24s -> 2023.36s]  Big, beautiful, and ready for the bees.
[2023.36s -> 2032.28s]  Is it taller than you?
[2032.28s -> 2033.16s]  Yes, it was.
[2033.16s -> 2036.92s]  Especially the one on the back got to be about,
[2036.92s -> 2040.59s]  I want to say eight feet tall, seven feet tall.
[2040.59s -> 2042.03s]  I didn't stand next to it for scale
[2042.03s -> 2042.83s]  because I'm not going to do that.
[2042.83s -> 2047.36s]  I'm not going to give you guys that image.
[2047.36s -> 2047.68s]  Yeah.
[2047.68s -> 2048.24s]  Oh, there's more.
[2048.24s -> 2049.12s]  Don't worry.
[2049.12s -> 2054.88s]  You see the one behind?
[2054.88s -> 2061.68s]  So the one behind did not open immediately with the others.
[2061.68s -> 2063.28s]  Took about another two or three weeks.
[2063.28s -> 2066.81s]  He has his father's eyes.
[2067.77s -> 2070.97s]  But see, the green stakes were to prevent the wind.
[2070.97s -> 2074.28s]  He was really trying to stop the wind from just crushing him.
[2074.28s -> 2078.00s]  The one in the back actually at one point was a big windstorm.
[2078.00s -> 2082.40s]  And it bowed to a point where I gasped audibly and was like,
[2084.16s -> 2089.69s]  like I just watched like a animal that I had
[2089.69s -> 2092.97s]  or like a fucking kid like running out of the house,
[2092.97s -> 2094.01s]  like straight out of the house,
[2094.01s -> 2096.01s]  into the front yard and stuff and into the driveway.
[2096.01s -> 2099.00s]  Like, no, don't get back here.
[2099.00s -> 2099.64s]  It was horrible.
[2102.16s -> 2107.45s]  But he was okay.
[2107.45s -> 2109.29s]  Because remember, this is important to know too,
[2110.01s -> 2112.33s]  is you got to take care of these every day.
[2112.33s -> 2115.84s]  This wasn't just, oh, I just have like a plant back there.
[2115.84s -> 2116.24s]  Fuck it.
[2116.24s -> 2116.80s]  Don't even care.
[2117.36s -> 2121.16s]  They needed constant attention trimming some of the leaves.
[2121.16s -> 2123.40s]  You can see some of the browning, the yellowing.
[2123.40s -> 2125.16s]  You really don't want that to happen.
[2125.16s -> 2126.28s]  You want to try to keep them healthy.
[2126.28s -> 2127.48s]  They need water.
[2127.48s -> 2128.76s]  They need to be trimmed.
[2128.76s -> 2130.44s]  They need to be like fertilized.
[2130.44s -> 2133.00s]  It's an everyday thing was out there.
[2133.00s -> 2136.12s]  So if one of them had, if they got destroyed,
[2136.12s -> 2140.32s]  like two and a half straight months of doing this,
[2140.32s -> 2142.48s]  it would have been so sad.
[2142.48s -> 2149.58s]  So this is the other one.
[2149.58s -> 2151.18s]  This is the secondary one.
[2152.04s -> 2153.00s]  He was just barely opening.
[2153.00s -> 2154.04s]  And here's the cool part about it.
[2154.04s -> 2155.08s]  Sunflowers, if you didn't know,
[2155.08s -> 2157.40s]  they're not always yellow and orange.
[2158.46s -> 2163.52s]  Sometimes they can be, drum roll, please.
[2163.52s -> 2164.24s]  Drum roll, please.
[2164.24s -> 2169.10s]  I'm waiting for you.
[2169.10s -> 2173.64s]  Red, purple, brown, even like a dark,
[2173.64s -> 2174.84s]  almost like a dark brown.
[2174.84s -> 2181.12s]  Now this is a rare, you know what I mean?
[2181.12s -> 2182.40s]  You got the yellows are commons,
[2182.40s -> 2183.92s]  orange is a kind of uncommon.
[2184.48s -> 2185.28s]  Red is rare.
[2185.28s -> 2188.16s]  Purple is fucking legendary.
[2188.16s -> 2188.88s]  And there's white too.
[2188.88s -> 2192.59s]  Yeah, there is.
[2192.59s -> 2196.03s]  And the packets that I was using was an assortment.
[2196.03s -> 2197.23s]  So I did not know.
[2198.03s -> 2199.87s]  I had no idea what they were going to be.
[2199.87s -> 2208.73s]  So it really was like opening up flower loot boxes.
[2208.73s -> 2213.98s]  And when it's fully open, kind of went more orange.
[2213.98s -> 2214.94s]  It was red initially.
[2216.83s -> 2218.65s]  Take a look.
[2218.65s -> 2221.23s]  The bees loved these things.
[2221.23s -> 2225.87s]  There was constantly bees, honeybees going out there
[2225.87s -> 2227.79s]  and looking at three or four honeybees,
[2227.79s -> 2229.87s]  just collecting, picking up pollen and stuff.
[2229.87s -> 2230.67s]  It was awesome.
[2236.19s -> 2240.27s]  You kind of get to watch what happens around us in a way.
[2241.15s -> 2242.19s]  Don't worry, I'm not going to become like,
[2242.19s -> 2244.75s]  oh, philosopher in there, you know, humanity.
[2244.75s -> 2245.87s]  No, but listen.
[2245.87s -> 2250.38s]  When you get to just sit there and watch that,
[2250.38s -> 2253.10s]  a bee just coming over and just collecting pollen,
[2253.10s -> 2255.50s]  it's like this whole world is around us
[2255.50s -> 2257.58s]  of just constant moving and shaking
[2257.58s -> 2260.46s]  and like cars and trucks and airplanes and technology.
[2261.10s -> 2262.54s]  And if you slow down for a second,
[2262.54s -> 2267.13s]  this is ridiculous that this is still going on.
[2267.13s -> 2268.73s]  They collect this shit every day.
[2268.73s -> 2272.11s]  It looks like a stock photo.
[2272.11s -> 2274.14s]  Yeah, that's how good it is.
[2274.14s -> 2279.77s]  Thank you. I appreciate that.
[2279.77s -> 2282.49s]  Yeah, that's the one that was in the pot on the left.
[2283.05s -> 2284.99s]  So this one is...
[2284.99s -> 2286.03s]  Let me see if I can get it again.
[2287.60s -> 2288.48s]  No, no, no, no.
[2288.48s -> 2290.92s]  Where is it?
[2290.92s -> 2292.04s]  No, okay.
[2292.04s -> 2293.80s]  So the pot all the way to the left
[2293.80s -> 2299.84s]  is the one that you just saw, is the red one.
[2299.84s -> 2302.27s]  Now we're almost done.
[2302.27s -> 2304.25s]  Hey, come on.
[2304.25s -> 2306.01s]  This is like three and a half months in the making.
[2306.01s -> 2306.57s]  I can do this.
[2306.57s -> 2307.45s]  I can stall.
[2307.45s -> 2313.13s]  Take a look.
[2313.13s -> 2317.90s]  Look at how big our boy has gotten.
[2317.90s -> 2321.34s]  He's stuck around for the whole four months.
[2325.07s -> 2330.25s]  And then one day he just wasn't there.
[2330.25s -> 2337.00s]  When we see these things, it makes us a little sad.
[2337.00s -> 2341.47s]  It makes us cry.
[2341.47s -> 2342.19s]  You ate him.
[2342.19s -> 2343.23s]  I didn't eat him.
[2343.23s -> 2351.53s]  They grow up so fast.
[2351.53s -> 2354.25s]  So when they had to be...
[2354.25s -> 2355.61s]  When the sunflowers actually had to be...
[2355.61s -> 2356.49s]  Because they were done.
[2356.49s -> 2359.72s]  They were kind of dead or dying.
[2359.72s -> 2361.44s]  They had to be taken up.
[2361.44s -> 2363.52s]  Because here's a really sad thing about sunflowers.
[2363.52s -> 2365.96s]  If you didn't know, this is really important info.
[2365.96s -> 2368.94s]  Sunflowers, at least most of them,
[2368.94s -> 2370.38s]  there are some that are...
[2371.52s -> 2372.59s]  That they come back.
[2372.59s -> 2374.59s]  I believe perennial versus annual.
[2374.59s -> 2376.51s]  Sunflowers die and don't come back.
[2376.51s -> 2380.00s]  So it's not like, oh, yeah, I plant my sunflowers.
[2380.00s -> 2381.52s]  They grow ahead this year.
[2381.52s -> 2382.64s]  Cool, they bloomed.
[2382.64s -> 2383.52s]  See you next year.
[2383.52s -> 2385.20s]  Ooh, it's chilly out in December.
[2385.20s -> 2386.00s]  I'll take care of you.
[2386.00s -> 2386.48s]  No, they're dead.
[2386.48s -> 2388.51s]  They don't come back.
[2388.51s -> 2391.47s]  So watching them die and knowing that that was it
[2391.47s -> 2395.77s]  and you were just going to kind of trim them down and pull them.
[2395.77s -> 2400.99s]  It was like, okay, I mentioned having your kid go to college.
[2400.99s -> 2402.43s]  You know, think about what it's like to...
[2403.55s -> 2408.01s]  It's like, no, not only you're at college,
[2408.09s -> 2412.17s]  you got married and you're never coming back to mom ever again.
[2412.17s -> 2414.73s]  You got married and you have like four kids and you're gone.
[2414.73s -> 2416.35s]  Ah, it was sad.
[2416.35s -> 2422.38s]  Are you going to dry them and roast them?
[2422.38s -> 2424.51s]  They actually were harvested.
[2424.51s -> 2427.55s]  So I took the heads off, spread them out.
[2427.55s -> 2434.49s]  It's a really weird process when you do that too.
[2434.49s -> 2437.37s]  Actually harvesting a sunflower is not what you guys think.
[2437.37s -> 2439.05s]  If you've never seen, go look at a video.
[2439.05s -> 2444.57s]  Go watch like a sunflower harvesting video.
[2444.57s -> 2447.95s]  It's weird.
[2447.95s -> 2450.65s]  You decapitated them.
[2450.65s -> 2451.45s]  Yeah, I did.
[2451.45s -> 2452.41s]  Who's that?
[2452.41s -> 2463.48s]  Wait, is that Otto?
[2463.48s -> 2464.60s]  Oh, look at it.
[2464.60s -> 2465.40s]  It's Otto.
[2472.14s -> 2475.68s]  But yeah, this guy stuck around the whole time.
[2475.68s -> 2479.26s]  And then he went off somewhere else.
[2479.26s -> 2485.77s]  But it was cool to see the baby turn into the adult.
[2485.77s -> 2487.21s]  I believe there's what, one more?
[2487.21s -> 2492.67s]  Yeah, so here's the final picture I'm going to show you.
[2492.67s -> 2493.47s]  It was a hydra.
[2495.10s -> 2502.60s]  So the one in the back grew to be this five-headed hydra.
[2502.60s -> 2509.44s]  And this is about, I want to say, seven to eight feet tall.
[2509.44s -> 2511.28s]  And there were even more heads too.
[2511.28s -> 2523.64s]  There were two or three more heads that started that kind of stopped halfway.
[2523.64s -> 2526.33s]  Because sometimes this doesn't happen.
[2526.33s -> 2530.12s]  Getting a hydra, a lot of people will trim the heads
[2530.12s -> 2534.99s]  to make the big head, the head in the front in the middle, bigger and stronger.
[2534.99s -> 2535.87s]  I was like, no, fuck it.
[2535.87s -> 2536.59s]  Let's just see what it does.
[2537.74s -> 2539.42s]  It had like seven or eight heads.
[2539.42s -> 2548.03s]  But only four or five of them opened like this.
[2548.03s -> 2550.67s]  This is a legendary drop, yeah.
[2550.67s -> 2552.99s]  So I will tell you, that's the remainder of these.
[2552.99s -> 2553.71s]  We'll zoom in a little.
[2555.88s -> 2556.76s]  It was really cool.
[2556.76s -> 2557.48s]  It was actually cool.
[2557.48s -> 2558.92s]  It seems like a kind of a boring...
[2560.03s -> 2562.75s]  I mean, I guess when I turned 35, I never thought I'd be like,
[2562.91s -> 2565.07s]  I can't wait to take a look at my sunflowers.
[2567.21s -> 2568.97s]  But it is kind of cool.
[2568.97s -> 2576.83s]  It was a fun experience.
[2576.83s -> 2581.04s]  And I'm going to do it again.
[2581.04s -> 2583.68s]  We'll see what kind of legendary drops I get next time.
[2583.68s -> 2584.48s]  Or maybe not.
[2584.48s -> 2588.11s]  It's not boring.
[2588.11s -> 2590.59s]  Oh yeah, I don't really think it is.
[2590.59s -> 2595.32s]  But it's so sad now because they were outside.
[2595.32s -> 2598.46s]  So when I look outside to where they were,
[2598.46s -> 2601.34s]  it was always sort of a morning ritual to just look out there and be like,
[2601.34s -> 2602.70s]  ah, there are the...
[2602.70s -> 2603.34s]  Oh, they're gone.
[2603.98s -> 2605.66s]  They're absolutely gone, completely.
[2607.88s -> 2611.32s]  But I got seeds from their heads.
[2611.32s -> 2613.16s]  And those seeds, I'm going to preserve them.
[2613.16s -> 2616.70s]  And that's the seeds I'm going to plant next year.
[2616.70s -> 2618.94s]  So the family will live on.
[2618.94s -> 2626.70s]  Yeah, it was cool.
[2627.26s -> 2628.94s]  So we'll do one more.
[2628.94s -> 2630.46s]  It'll give you a little perspective here.
[2630.46s -> 2631.42s]  So here we go.
[2631.42s -> 2633.88s]  Here's the little babies.
[2633.88s -> 2637.20s]  There they are.
[2637.20s -> 2643.48s]  And they grew into this.
[2643.48s -> 2645.47s]  Plants are so weird.
[2645.47s -> 2647.79s]  The fact that a tiny little seed can just do this.
[2647.79s -> 2650.67s]  It's just crazy.
[2650.67s -> 2654.91s]  So if you want to know which one this one is,
[2655.93s -> 2662.09s]  this one, I believe, is this one here.
[2662.09s -> 2666.96s]  So this right here turned into this.
[2666.96s -> 2672.86s]  Stage one, final stage writer.
[2672.86s -> 2683.00s]  Absolutely insane.
[2683.00s -> 2684.36s]  It's to scale.
[2684.36s -> 2684.86s]  Yeah.
[2685.24s -> 2687.93s]  Did you name them?
[2688.81s -> 2690.33s]  No, not really.
[2690.33s -> 2692.78s]  There you go.
[2692.78s -> 2693.90s]  There's the sunflowers.
[2693.90s -> 2705.08s]  The sunflower journey is over.
[2705.08s -> 2706.12s]  Wasn't that worth waiting for?
[2712.60s -> 2713.96s]  The stream's not over.
[2713.96s -> 2717.32s]  The stream's not over.
[2717.32s -> 2718.04s]  That's imagine...
[2718.04s -> 2719.00s]  All right, see you later.
[2719.00s -> 2719.80s]  See you next week.
[2721.02s -> 2722.22s]  That was an accidental click.
[2722.22s -> 2723.18s]  You don't have to leave.
[2723.18s -> 2730.04s]  Okay.
[2730.04s -> 2731.08s]  Let's go back to it.
[2731.08s -> 2734.12s]  Back to No More Heroes.
[2734.76s -> 2735.72s]  End of the stream.
[2737.08s -> 2738.36s]  I got a couple more battles to do.
[2738.36s -> 2739.24s]  But yeah, it was cool.
[2740.94s -> 2742.46s]  I always wanted to do sunflowers.
[2745.47s -> 2747.95s]  And they get really big and healthy out here.
[2747.95s -> 2750.51s]  We had some community subs here.
[2750.51s -> 2755.02s]  We had five community subs from STXNE.
[2755.02s -> 2756.38s]  Ten from Leon.
[2757.77s -> 2759.53s]  Five community subs from TheFoolie.
[2759.53s -> 2761.21s]  And five community subs from Halulu.
[2761.93s -> 2762.49s]  Thank you, guys.
[2763.13s -> 2763.77s]  Thanks, Halulu.
[2764.33s -> 2767.40s]  Appreciate those five subs.
[2767.40s -> 2776.14s]  I'm talking about your flowers for ten minutes
[2776.14s -> 2778.06s]  added years onto my lifespan.
[2778.06s -> 2779.18s]  Well, if you got...
[2779.66s -> 2781.96s]  Yeah, it was cool.
[2783.29s -> 2784.89s]  Can you eat more than the seeds?
[2784.89s -> 2785.93s]  I think you can eat the heads.
[2787.29s -> 2788.09s]  Shut up.
[2788.09s -> 2789.85s]  I'm talking about my sunflowers, okay?
[2789.85s -> 2791.29s]  Sorry, I'm not killing people
[2791.29s -> 2792.65s]  with a fucking sword right now.
[2792.65s -> 2793.45s]  All right, relax.
[2798.92s -> 2799.96s]  Yeah, I think you can eat the heads.
[2803.08s -> 2805.40s]  I don't know if I would eat the actual heads.
[2806.12s -> 2807.71s]  Then you can grill them.
[2808.99s -> 2809.95s]  I love sunflower seeds.
[2809.95s -> 2810.51s]  They're delicious.
[2814.73s -> 2816.09s]  And you get a lot of them.
[2816.09s -> 2817.29s]  That was also surprising, too.
[2818.01s -> 2820.41s]  Because I wonder how many sunflower seeds
[2820.41s -> 2822.25s]  I get from one sunflower head.
[2822.25s -> 2824.17s]  It's like 50.
[2824.17s -> 2824.97s]  It's like 100.
[2827.95s -> 2829.63s]  LSFone, thanks for the ten community subs.
[2829.63s -> 2830.43s]  Appreciate it.
[2830.43s -> 2837.31s]  Snooze and Copter.
[2837.31s -> 2838.83s]  What's up with all the community subs?
[2838.83s -> 2840.43s]  Five community subs from Snooze and Copter.
[2840.43s -> 2840.93s]  Thanks.
[2846.96s -> 2847.92s]  Eating your children.
[2848.96s -> 2856.43s]  We're actually eating sunflower babies?
[2856.43s -> 2856.93s]  No.
[2857.47s -> 2859.52s]  I don't think that's accurate.
[2859.52s -> 2860.80s]  You're eating sunflower...
[2864.56s -> 2866.80s]  Thank you, Onymos, for the 20 community subs.
[2868.28s -> 2868.78s]  20.
[2871.32s -> 2872.12s]  That's a big number.
[2872.12s -> 2872.76s]  Thanks for the 20.
[2876.96s -> 2877.28s]  Say it.
[2877.28s -> 2877.92s]  I'm not going to say it.
[2877.92s -> 2878.56s]  You can figure it out.
[2879.28s -> 2884.51s]  What's going on right now?
[2884.51s -> 2885.79s]  Why is so many people giving subs?
[2886.43s -> 2889.60s]  MadStury gave 20.
[2898.86s -> 2900.22s]  MelScribbles5?
[2900.22s -> 2900.86s]  Oh my god.
[2903.64s -> 2904.92s]  I just showed sunflowers.
[2904.92s -> 2905.48s]  I don't...
[2905.48s -> 2906.20s]  You don't have to do this.
[2907.79s -> 2909.39s]  Thanks for the 10 subs potato chips, though.
[2914.40s -> 2915.76s]  Oh my goodness gracious.
[2915.76s -> 2916.24s]  I don't...
[2916.88s -> 2919.68s]  You guys just did this like a week and a half ago.
[2919.68s -> 2921.44s]  You don't have to do it again.
[2921.44s -> 2922.88s]  You guys just did this.
[2922.88s -> 2926.36s]  You know how many people subbed during the dollhouse stream?
[2927.24s -> 2928.20s]  We don't have to do this again.
[2929.00s -> 2929.80s]  I really mean it.
[2929.80s -> 2930.20s]  Trust me.
[2934.62s -> 2935.34s]  I can't even talk.
[2936.89s -> 2938.65s]  Another 10 came in 25.
[2938.65s -> 2939.45s]  Hold on.
[2939.45s -> 2943.37s]  Oh Jesus.
[2944.44s -> 2944.92s]  All right.
[2944.92s -> 2945.56s]  I'm just gonna...
[2949.05s -> 2950.73s]  You're funding the sunflowers.
[2950.73s -> 2952.25s]  Sunflowers are like a dollar.
[2952.81s -> 2955.53s]  It's like two bucks for a pack of like a thousand of them.
[2956.01s -> 2956.81s]  That's...
[2956.81s -> 2959.93s]  You're giving me like a 50 million percent premium.
[2960.49s -> 2962.25s]  So you don't have to do that.
[2966.11s -> 2972.52s]  Oh my god guys.
[2975.53s -> 2976.17s]  I can't even...
[2978.64s -> 2979.92s]  It's a sub storm.
[2983.34s -> 2986.72s]  It's for sun...
[2986.72s -> 2988.56s]  Cry cry cry.
[2988.56s -> 2989.52s]  I'm not gonna cry.
[2994.19s -> 2995.23s]  Thank you all of you.
[2995.23s -> 2995.95s]  It's...
[2995.95s -> 2997.15s]  It's unnecessary though.
[2997.15s -> 2997.95s]  You don't...
[2997.95s -> 2998.67s]  We don't have to do this.
[3001.48s -> 3001.88s]  Too much.
[3005.96s -> 3007.48s]  You're standing in the middle of the street.
[3007.80s -> 3008.52s]  Well I mean I've got some...
[3010.04s -> 3011.24s]  Hundreds of subs are coming in.
[3011.88s -> 3015.82s]  This is a new enemy.
[3019.04s -> 3021.04s]  He's gonna cry when he says he's not gonna cry.
[3021.04s -> 3021.84s]  I'm not gonna cry.
[3022.40s -> 3026.83s]  Thank you though guys.
[3026.83s -> 3027.56s]  Appreciate it.
[3037.13s -> 3040.52s]  Let's sing the song.
[3041.82s -> 3047.20s]  Thank you for the subs.
[3051.29s -> 3052.41s]  I'm just gonna play.
[3052.41s -> 3052.97s]  I'm gonna play.
[3052.97s -> 3053.69s]  This is...
[3053.69s -> 3055.05s]  This is fucking insane.
[3055.05s -> 3056.89s]  You just did this.
[3056.89s -> 3059.21s]  Like thousands of subs came in like a week and a half ago.
[3059.21s -> 3060.81s]  I don't expect this to ever happen.
[3060.97s -> 3061.53s]  Again.
[3061.53s -> 3061.93s]  And I don't...
[3061.93s -> 3062.33s]  It doesn't...
[3062.33s -> 3062.81s]  You don't have...
[3063.77s -> 3064.65s]  Thank you everybody.
[3065.21s -> 3065.77s]  I'm gonna play...
[3065.77s -> 3068.36s]  I'm gonna continue to play No More Heroes.
[3068.36s -> 3069.40s]  I really appreciate it.
[3069.40s -> 3071.40s]  I hope that you think it's worth the money you're paying.
[3073.05s -> 3074.81s]  I'll try to use your money the best way I can.
[3076.17s -> 3077.85s]  By buying snacks.
[3077.85s -> 3080.09s]  And by purchasing equipment.
[3081.28s -> 3081.52s]  For...
[3081.52s -> 3082.00s]  Oh I'm gonna...
[3082.00s -> 3083.44s]  Well you know I'm gonna get equipment for the stream.
[3086.88s -> 3088.00s]  All right what does this guy do?
[3088.00s -> 3088.72s]  What does this guy do?
[3088.72s -> 3089.36s]  He's cracking.
[3089.36s -> 3090.32s]  You guys are cracking me.
[3090.32s -> 3091.76s]  I'm getting cracked.
[3091.76s -> 3093.28s]  These guys are full on attackers.
[3093.28s -> 3093.92s]  Guard yourself.
[3094.00s -> 3094.96s]  Watch out for an opening.
[3094.96s -> 3096.00s]  Check your remaining power.
[3097.68s -> 3098.72s]  Sunflower equipment.
[3099.60s -> 3101.04s]  I'm gonna buy stream equipment.
[3101.04s -> 3102.08s]  Like what the fuck?
[3102.08s -> 3102.88s]  What a lie.
[3102.88s -> 3103.20s]  That's not...
[3103.20s -> 3104.96s]  I'm not gonna buy streaming equipment.
[3105.76s -> 3106.64s]  What does that even mean?
[3107.68s -> 3116.30s]  This is a boss.
[3117.26s -> 3120.67s]  I love this game by the way.
[3120.67s -> 3121.79s]  I like gardening equipment.
[3122.35s -> 3123.47s]  Throw crazy.
[3123.47s -> 3123.87s]  Throw crazy.
[3123.87s -> 3124.35s]  Throw crazy.
[3124.35s -> 3124.83s]  Throw crazy.
[3124.83s -> 3125.39s]  Throw crazy.
[3126.19s -> 3131.50s]  Throw crazy.
[3131.50s -> 3137.47s]  I can't grab the boss?
[3137.47s -> 3149.95s]  Why does he keep saying double kill?
[3149.95s -> 3150.75s]  I'm not killing anybody.
[3155.40s -> 3157.42s]  All right let's go kick this guy's ass.
[3158.65s -> 3159.45s]  And whoop.
[3163.45s -> 3163.77s]  All right.
[3163.77s -> 3165.69s]  Death meld shower.
[3165.69s -> 3166.33s]  I cannot hit him.
[3171.45s -> 3174.36s]  Do I have to do a perfect dodge to hurt him?
[3175.08s -> 3178.92s]  Oh my god.
[3178.92s -> 3179.56s]  What the fuck's going on?
[3181.69s -> 3182.33s]  Do I have to guard?
[3183.61s -> 3186.28s]  They got the perfect dodging.
[3194.84s -> 3196.20s]  All right dodge.
[3198.94s -> 3200.30s]  What the fuck?
[3200.30s -> 3203.74s]  What do I have to do?
[3204.54s -> 3207.18s]  I guess he just did perfect dodging.
[3213.20s -> 3213.68s]  Jesus.
[3214.88s -> 3215.76s]  No I can hit him now.
[3215.76s -> 3216.08s]  What?
[3216.08s -> 3216.56s]  That was weird.
[3216.56s -> 3217.36s]  Why couldn't I do it before?
[3218.24s -> 3219.12s]  I'm just swinging at nothing.
[3220.00s -> 3220.48s]  What are you gonna do?
[3220.48s -> 3221.36s]  Harvest moon stream?
[3221.92s -> 3222.32s]  Tomorrow.
[3223.36s -> 3223.76s]  Just kidding.
[3225.92s -> 3230.32s]  Whoa.
[3231.52s -> 3233.53s]  He's got weirdly timed moves.
[3235.60s -> 3236.00s]  Jesus.
[3236.00s -> 3237.12s]  This guy's fucking hard.
[3239.72s -> 3241.40s]  He has like 15 different moves.
[3242.20s -> 3250.54s]  All right this is my least favorite guy so far.
[3251.26s -> 3257.84s]  I don't think I can dodge that.
[3278.43s -> 3279.15s]  All right there we go.
[3279.15s -> 3280.67s]  That's how you just double it up.
[3282.03s -> 3285.98s]  He's boring.
[3285.98s -> 3287.58s]  He's not boring so you can't beat him.
[3287.58s -> 3290.14s]  I had like an S going that whole time too and now it's gonna be a C.
[3291.18s -> 3296.75s]  You've said this is my least favorite guy so far to everybody.
[3297.47s -> 3299.05s]  No I haven't.
[3299.05s -> 3300.25s]  I've said it to two different enemies.
[3300.89s -> 3302.24s]  What are you talking about?
[3302.88s -> 3309.07s]  This title is so annoying.
[3309.07s -> 3310.83s]  I'm probably saying annoying people that scroll by.
[3311.63s -> 3322.99s]  Okay one more of those.
[3322.99s -> 3323.95s]  There's one right next to me.
[3328.86s -> 3330.22s]  Why are you so self-conscious?
[3333.26s -> 3334.14s]  I mean think about it.
[3334.14s -> 3335.82s]  Okay just think about pull yourself out.
[3336.54s -> 3338.22s]  Think about it with a different perspective.
[3338.22s -> 3343.28s]  If you were scrolling down Twitch right now and you saw the stream and the title was
[3343.84s -> 3347.36s]  Hello there haha like how it's funny like all capitals.
[3347.36s -> 3350.88s]  Get out get out of here.
[3350.88s -> 3352.62s]  You'd be like I'm not clicking on that stream.
[3352.62s -> 3353.58s]  That guy's like a dork.
[3375.08s -> 3384.12s]  Don't talk about my favorite streamer like that.
[3388.46s -> 3391.66s]  This is great so if I really like this game a lot.
[3391.66s -> 3393.74s]  It's very I'm having a good time.
[3394.46s -> 3396.78s]  All right count how many times I say this is my least favorite enemy.
[3396.78s -> 3398.94s]  But also count how many times I said I like this game a lot.
[3408.46s -> 3409.50s]  There's so many of these guys.
[3409.50s -> 3410.22s]  Holy shit.
[3411.10s -> 3416.12s]  I gotta fight them inside of this thing.
[3417.40s -> 3421.20s]  Mustang mode.
[3421.20s -> 3422.56s]  Oh my god give me an S plus.
[3423.68s -> 3424.56s]  Come on S plus.
[3427.04s -> 3428.64s]  S plus I can get it by doing this.
[3441.02s -> 3442.14s]  This is how you get the S plus.
[3443.26s -> 3448.80s]  Only one guy left.
[3448.80s -> 3449.20s]  Come on.
[3449.20s -> 3450.64s]  It's been like not even two minutes.
[3451.44s -> 3455.68s]  Come on.
[3463.66s -> 3464.38s]  That has to be S.
[3464.94s -> 3468.78s]  I didn't get the 100 combo.
[3468.78s -> 3469.58s]  I know it sucks.
[3470.22s -> 3472.19s]  I'm good though.
[3472.19s -> 3476.16s]  We're fine.
[3476.16s -> 3477.68s]  One minute and 10 seconds.
[3477.68s -> 3478.16s]  There we go.
[3481.29s -> 3482.33s]  Probably isn't an S plus.
[3482.89s -> 3489.79s]  I took too much damage.
[3489.79s -> 3493.02s]  Yeah probably.
[3493.02s -> 3498.59s]  Fuck there is actually an SS.
[3498.59s -> 3506.19s]  Oh how much money do I need for the tournament?
[3510.78s -> 3512.38s]  30,000 coins what do I have?
[3514.16s -> 3518.40s]  How many coins do I have?
[3523.44s -> 3524.32s]  I sound sad.
[3525.88s -> 3528.36s]  We just did the sunflower thing and I'm like sad about it.
[3529.08s -> 3534.44s]  Okay I was putting it off for so long.
[3535.00s -> 3537.79s]  These cars are driving backwards by the way.
[3538.43s -> 3549.69s]  Imagine if there was a star system in the game.
[3559.28s -> 3561.12s]  I feel like is there another job I can do?
[3561.92s -> 3564.41s]  I don't know if this is going to be enough money.
[3564.97s -> 3572.28s]  Travis touchdown.
[3572.28s -> 3572.84s]  Hit and run.
[3573.88s -> 3576.17s]  I pressed A.
[3576.17s -> 3577.29s]  I tried to get it.
[3577.29s -> 3587.26s]  This one's silver.
[3587.26s -> 3587.98s]  Silver scorpion.
[3587.98s -> 3588.86s]  It seems super hard.
[3589.50s -> 3601.18s]  Okay where is this fight?
[3603.79s -> 3604.19s]  Hello?
[3609.00s -> 3609.48s]  Hello?
[3614.03s -> 3615.07s]  In the water?
[3615.07s -> 3621.45s]  Where is this fight?
[3621.45s -> 3627.90s]  Am I losing my mind?
[3627.90s -> 3647.26s]  Has to be like over here then.
[3647.26s -> 3648.94s]  Behind the back fence is it?
[3649.50s -> 3658.46s]  Whose fence?
[3658.46s -> 3663.02s]  Who has a back fence to go over?
[3665.53s -> 3666.57s]  Skate three.
[3666.57s -> 3668.25s]  This is not skate three.
[3668.25s -> 3669.13s]  Where is this thing?
[3675.95s -> 3676.67s]  Oh my god.
[3676.67s -> 3678.03s]  Okay well come on.
[3678.03s -> 3686.06s]  I'm standing right in front of it off the motorcycle.
[3686.06s -> 3686.62s]  Whatever.
[3686.62s -> 3700.67s]  Pretending to be bad at video games.
[3701.87s -> 3702.27s]  That's it.
[3702.27s -> 3702.99s]  I'm leaving.
[3702.99s -> 3703.31s]  Stay.
[3704.33s -> 3706.03s]  Stay.
[3706.03s -> 3706.91s]  Don't go.
[3706.91s -> 3710.08s]  Are you going to play the skate?
[3710.08s -> 3711.04s]  New skate game coming out?
[3711.04s -> 3711.20s]  No.
[3711.20s -> 3712.00s]  Here we go.
[3712.00s -> 3714.08s]  I swore off all skate games forever.
[3714.88s -> 3716.03s]  All of them.
[3716.03s -> 3716.53s]  Forever.
[3722.19s -> 3724.62s]  He actually hit me.
[3737.20s -> 3737.44s]  Get.
[3738.40s -> 3738.96s]  Come on.
[3738.96s -> 3739.92s]  Get that shit out of here.
[3743.18s -> 3743.50s]  Really?
[3744.46s -> 3744.86s]  Really?
[3745.42s -> 3746.62s]  I grabbed his ass.
[3755.37s -> 3756.41s]  Here comes another C.
[3764.51s -> 3767.32s]  I'm going to die.
[3768.28s -> 3776.36s]  This might be the first D the whole time I played.
[3792.99s -> 3793.63s]  D Andy.
[3794.27s -> 3795.26s]  That's me.
[3796.30s -> 3798.52s]  I'm going to C Andy.
[3798.52s -> 3799.72s]  Don't fucking talk shit.
[3800.60s -> 3802.51s]  Tried to dodge.
[3803.15s -> 3806.51s]  Tried to dodge but I pressed every button on the Switch Joy-Con controller.
[3806.51s -> 3808.51s]  Because it's a piece of shit.
[3808.51s -> 3808.75s]  Okay.
[3808.75s -> 3809.07s]  Hold on.
[3809.07s -> 3809.79s]  Slow down.
[3809.79s -> 3810.83s]  Don't get angry at this.
[3810.83s -> 3811.63s]  I love this game.
[3816.11s -> 3821.58s]  All right.
[3821.58s -> 3821.90s]  Come on.
[3823.08s -> 3823.40s]  All right.
[3823.40s -> 3823.64s]  Come on.
[3839.56s -> 3841.15s]  That's going to be an A.
[3841.95s -> 3849.05s]  Oh no.
[3849.05s -> 3852.17s]  He's starting to pretend convince himself to not get mad.
[3853.37s -> 3854.01s]  Don't get mad.
[3854.01s -> 3854.49s]  Don't get mad.
[3854.49s -> 3855.13s]  I'm going to get mad.
[3855.93s -> 3862.24s]  He never does jump attacks.
[3862.24s -> 3862.40s]  No.
[3862.40s -> 3862.96s]  You already don't.
[3863.60s -> 3864.64s]  I don't know why.
[3864.64s -> 3868.56s]  I feel like it just puts me in C Andy.
[3871.72s -> 3872.20s]  Candy?
[3882.22s -> 3882.70s]  Whatever.
[3882.70s -> 3882.94s]  All right.
[3882.94s -> 3883.74s]  I have enough money.
[3884.86s -> 3886.22s]  I want to do some more things though.
[3888.04s -> 3888.84s]  C Andy.
[3888.84s -> 3892.56s]  It's not C Andy.
[3892.56s -> 3893.20s]  Whatever.
[3893.20s -> 3893.76s]  It's fine.
[3894.96s -> 3896.36s]  Let me look at the map.
[3896.36s -> 3897.87s]  All right.
[3897.87s -> 3898.59s]  There's a toilet.
[3898.59s -> 3899.63s]  The sushi shop.
[3900.27s -> 3900.91s]  ATM.
[3900.91s -> 3901.71s]  T-shirt alien.
[3902.35s -> 3903.07s]  Defense mission.
[3903.71s -> 3905.56s]  Nothing really even over here.
[3909.37s -> 3910.73s]  Let's pay the ATM.
[3910.73s -> 3912.25s]  Let's go to the T-shirt alien.
[3912.25s -> 3914.06s]  If I can get this.
[3914.06s -> 3921.87s]  Is there another mission for the Molon?
[3924.43s -> 3925.23s]  Is this like a level two?
[3925.87s -> 3932.48s]  Oh, level two.
[3932.48s -> 3932.88s]  Let's go.
[3933.44s -> 3939.72s]  There are rocks in the way now.
[3939.72s -> 3940.04s]  Okay.
[3941.16s -> 3945.85s]  Three minutes.
[3946.41s -> 3954.14s]  Okay.
[3954.14s -> 3954.78s]  Just keep that up.
[3954.78s -> 3957.64s]  I missed a little piece but it's fine.
[3958.20s -> 3964.25s]  I'm trying to turn the damn thing.
[3965.95s -> 3967.87s]  What's North America's most well-known dam?
[3969.44s -> 3969.92s]  Hoover Dam.
[3970.56s -> 3974.48s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[3975.36s -> 3975.60s]  Hey.
[3986.01s -> 4005.60s]  Don't hit me.
[4005.68s -> 4008.88s]  What's the tallest building in North America?
[4012.36s -> 4013.24s]  Empire Strikes Back.
[4018.14s -> 4018.46s]  I don't know.
[4018.46s -> 4019.90s]  The Sears Tower.
[4019.90s -> 4030.28s]  It was.
[4030.92s -> 4032.12s]  It was the Sears Tower for a while.
[4032.76s -> 4034.01s]  What is it now?
[4041.93s -> 4044.49s]  When are you going to stream Doki Doki Literature Club?
[4044.49s -> 4044.81s]  Never.
[4046.03s -> 4047.69s]  Ever.
[4047.69s -> 4049.69s]  I promise you'll never see that on this channel.
[4051.93s -> 4052.33s]  Ever.
[4055.64s -> 4056.36s]  I got crystals.
[4056.36s -> 4056.76s]  Nice.
[4056.76s -> 4064.25s]  Do I even have enough money?
[4064.97s -> 4066.24s]  I don't even have enough money.
[4067.24s -> 4067.88s]  30,000.
[4072.48s -> 4072.72s]  Good.
[4072.72s -> 4074.00s]  You would suck at it.
[4074.00s -> 4075.55s]  Well, good.
[4075.55s -> 4076.91s]  You don't have to worry about watching me play it.
[4082.57s -> 4083.29s]  I've definitely done.
[4083.29s -> 4084.33s]  Oh, I like that.
[4084.33s -> 4091.15s]  I can get it.
[4091.15s -> 4091.47s]  Cool.
[4091.47s -> 4092.19s]  All right.
[4092.19s -> 4094.43s]  I actually really like that shirt.
[4096.27s -> 4102.20s]  Remember, don't read the hate comments.
[4105.05s -> 4106.49s]  What hate comments?
[4106.49s -> 4110.03s]  All right.
[4110.03s -> 4111.23s]  We're going to make some money.
[4111.23s -> 4113.72s]  Let's travel here.
[4113.72s -> 4115.00s]  I know.
[4115.00s -> 4115.80s]  Fast traveling.
[4115.80s -> 4116.44s]  I know.
[4116.44s -> 4117.08s]  Right.
[4117.08s -> 4117.40s]  Right.
[4117.40s -> 4117.64s]  I know.
[4117.64s -> 4118.60s]  Right, right, right, right.
[4118.60s -> 4123.98s]  I feel like I've already done everything over here
[4123.98s -> 4125.10s]  and why would I drive by anyway?
[4135.39s -> 4137.07s]  Remember, you only have four months left
[4137.07s -> 4138.59s]  for two Catboy streams.
[4142.01s -> 4145.53s]  What do you mean two?
[4149.31s -> 4151.07s]  Catboy's already made their appearance.
[4151.07s -> 4152.44s]  What are you talking about?
[4158.81s -> 4159.61s]  Here's the scorpions.
[4161.20s -> 4166.09s]  I got shredded snake skin and a chicken feather.
[4166.73s -> 4169.07s]  Oh, now I got enough money.
[4169.07s -> 4169.31s]  Nice.
[4169.87s -> 4173.08s]  I was supposed to be two in a row.
[4174.28s -> 4175.08s]  Do you guys remember?
[4175.88s -> 4176.76s]  Some of you guys that have been here
[4176.76s -> 4178.28s]  for more than four or five years plus.
[4179.66s -> 4181.82s]  Some of you guys will remember that.
[4181.82s -> 4183.58s]  Didn't I ask a long time ago
[4183.58s -> 4185.74s]  to have somebody compile every lie I've ever said?
[4186.54s -> 4189.48s]  And it was a funny little joke,
[4189.48s -> 4191.16s]  but somebody in the chat made a really good point.
[4191.16s -> 4193.08s]  They were like, dude, that video would take forever to make.
[4193.72s -> 4196.28s]  It'd be like four or five hours long of edited clips.
[4197.08s -> 4200.43s]  I'm like, holy shit, is it really that much?
[4201.47s -> 4202.59s]  They're like, yeah, dude,
[4202.59s -> 4205.71s]  you say weird fucking lies every other stream.
[4206.51s -> 4208.99s]  I'm like, no, but not that much.
[4209.63s -> 4212.51s]  A litter box.
[4212.51s -> 4218.08s]  Yeah, well, did I do this one?
[4218.08s -> 4221.26s]  Level two volunteer mission, let's go.
[4221.82s -> 4236.06s]  Accelerate.
[4236.06s -> 4236.56s]  Boost.
[4237.90s -> 4239.66s]  It goes two streams in a row.
[4240.30s -> 4244.94s]  Oh, right, I can't hit the other cars.
[4244.94s -> 4245.44s]  Forgot.
[4249.04s -> 4249.92s]  Well, it's hard to do that
[4249.92s -> 4251.68s]  when they're directly in the way
[4251.68s -> 4252.88s]  and I take up almost the whole road.
[4254.60s -> 4256.44s]  The only thing I've hit this whole time
[4256.44s -> 4258.04s]  has been a pedestrian car.
[4258.68s -> 4260.12s]  It's the only thing I've hit the whole time.
[4260.84s -> 4280.25s]  Get it.
[4280.25s -> 4285.26s]  God, it's because I have to hit them
[4285.26s -> 4286.86s]  with the edges of the car, right?
[4287.66s -> 4289.64s]  I don't have a minute to do this.
[4290.36s -> 4300.24s]  I'm not going to do it.
[4300.24s -> 4305.84s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[4305.84s -> 4314.08s]  Just forget about it.
[4314.08s -> 4314.72s]  I have to just win.
[4315.60s -> 4317.56s]  Can you get an F?
[4318.28s -> 4320.33s]  I guess F is actually not completing it.
[4320.33s -> 4322.09s]  Is there actually a D or C the lowest you can get?
[4334.28s -> 4335.40s]  I'm just looking at chat.
[4352.24s -> 4354.56s]  Name the Mantis Cromwell.
[4354.56s -> 4372.11s]  It's not a bad name.
[4372.11s -> 4372.91s]  Get over here.
[4373.47s -> 4378.46s]  All right.
[4378.46s -> 4379.58s]  I'm going to be really honest with you.
[4380.75s -> 4382.91s]  This minigame is as good
[4383.47s -> 4387.39s]  as the game that's in the ad for the iPad game.
[4387.39s -> 4391.28s]  That's how good this is.
[4391.28s -> 4393.28s]  Like the ad you get for the game
[4394.84s -> 4399.28s]  for the iPad game that they're advertising you.
[4399.28s -> 4400.00s]  The ad game.
[4400.00s -> 4400.96s]  That's what is it.
[4400.96s -> 4402.40s]  It's that same quality.
[4402.40s -> 4414.11s]  A lot of you don't get it.
[4414.11s -> 4414.59s]  All right.
[4414.59s -> 4416.03s]  So you know when you're when you get an ad
[4416.03s -> 4416.83s]  for an iPad game
[4417.84s -> 4419.60s]  and they say drive on the road
[4420.16s -> 4421.12s]  then you just put your finger
[4421.12s -> 4422.32s]  and you have to actually do it to.
[4423.36s -> 4424.32s]  It's not the actual game.
[4424.32s -> 4426.72s]  It's the it's an ad game for the actual game.
[4427.52s -> 4428.32s]  I don't get ads.
[4428.32s -> 4428.72s]  What?
[4428.72s -> 4429.84s]  You're just a hater.
[4429.84s -> 4430.56s]  Mobile gamer.
[4432.92s -> 4434.76s]  Well, but never mind.
[4435.32s -> 4447.18s]  Is there another one already?
[4448.64s -> 4449.44s]  Level three.
[4449.44s -> 4450.00s]  Oh God.
[4450.00s -> 4450.64s]  I hate this.
[4451.28s -> 4458.62s]  I don't want to do level three.
[4459.18s -> 4463.72s]  But I'm going to I'm just going to get out of the way.
[4472.99s -> 4473.63s]  All about speed.
[4473.63s -> 4474.91s]  That's all I care about right now.
[4474.91s -> 4477.79s]  I'm collecting these like punchy.
[4477.79s -> 4478.59s]  That's all I care about.
[4478.59s -> 4485.37s]  Let's start.
[4490.36s -> 4490.84s]  Good start.
[4491.56s -> 4492.20s]  This might be a.
[4492.84s -> 4503.69s]  All right.
[4503.69s -> 4504.41s]  Wait for the cool down.
[4512.70s -> 4513.66s]  No pedestrians hit.
[4519.53s -> 4527.37s]  I'm just waiting to accidentally touch the screen
[4527.37s -> 4528.33s]  so the app store open.
[4550.49s -> 4550.73s]  No.
[4552.97s -> 4565.10s]  All right.
[4565.10s -> 4565.42s]  One more.
[4565.42s -> 4565.66s]  Come on.
[4565.66s -> 4566.78s]  Still in this territory.
[4566.78s -> 4574.28s]  Oh, please don't hit yellow.
[4577.23s -> 4577.87s]  So close.
[4579.87s -> 4580.51s]  So close.
[4580.51s -> 4581.15s]  So close.
[4581.15s -> 4582.03s]  So close.
[4582.03s -> 4583.23s]  So close.
[4583.23s -> 4583.95s]  So got it.
[4584.59s -> 4588.36s]  He's giving me motion sickness.
[4588.36s -> 4589.24s]  Me too.
[4589.24s -> 4590.67s]  I'm just trying to get him out of the way.
[4591.23s -> 4595.44s]  All right.
[4595.44s -> 4596.08s]  I'll take a gold.
[4596.80s -> 4617.18s]  Holy shit.
[4618.57s -> 4620.41s]  Death drive MK1.
[4620.41s -> 4621.48s]  I got a car.
[4626.40s -> 4626.80s]  Nice.
[4626.80s -> 4627.12s]  All right.
[4628.73s -> 4630.41s]  I got enough money with the ATM.
[4630.41s -> 4636.51s]  This is rank kind of rank six.
[4636.51s -> 4637.07s]  Rank seven.
[4637.63s -> 4638.40s]  I don't know.
[4638.40s -> 4638.96s]  I'm just playing.
[4640.91s -> 4642.03s]  Go to the video store first.
[4642.03s -> 4644.19s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4644.19s -> 4647.80s]  The hell's a video store.
[4647.80s -> 4651.63s]  Sushi.
[4651.63s -> 4652.19s]  Beef head.
[4652.83s -> 4656.36s]  Where is it?
[4656.36s -> 4657.24s]  Trash collection.
[4657.24s -> 4660.27s]  Oh, I do trash collection.
[4660.27s -> 4663.71s]  Where is it?
[4663.71s -> 4664.35s]  Is it beef head?
[4664.83s -> 4671.93s]  Where's that?
[4671.93s -> 4672.89s]  What's the video store called?
[4673.53s -> 4676.17s]  Video store is near parliament.
[4679.16s -> 4679.56s]  I'm sorry.
[4679.56s -> 4680.44s]  I didn't understand.
[4680.44s -> 4681.96s]  You didn't stand up slowly.
[4684.14s -> 4686.22s]  And arch your back and put your chin in the air.
[4686.22s -> 4688.86s]  So I don't understand what you just said.
[4701.18s -> 4702.14s]  Yeah, this is it.
[4702.14s -> 4712.20s]  This guy's high as fuck.
[4714.41s -> 4719.07s]  No, he's not.
[4719.07s -> 4720.59s]  Death man is just too damn cool.
[4720.59s -> 4723.21s]  Here's your cut.
[4723.21s -> 4727.37s]  Final doll.
[4727.37s -> 4728.89s]  I had more than one, didn't I?
[4728.89s -> 4732.62s]  Hey, what's up?
[4732.62s -> 4733.42s]  Check car.
[4733.42s -> 4737.45s]  Oh, sell junk?
[4737.45s -> 4741.44s]  That's 10 grand.
[4741.44s -> 4742.16s]  Wait, but isn't this?
[4742.88s -> 4743.76s]  I don't know.
[4743.76s -> 4745.28s]  These are materials.
[4745.28s -> 4750.67s]  I don't want to sell these.
[4750.67s -> 4754.32s]  This is not junk.
[4754.32s -> 4755.12s]  No, no, no, no.
[4755.12s -> 4760.70s]  I don't want that.
[4760.70s -> 4761.34s]  Cool.
[4761.34s -> 4764.33s]  Do not sell.
[4764.33s -> 4764.81s]  Hold them.
[4764.81s -> 4768.65s]  Yeah, I'm not selling.
[4768.65s -> 4770.89s]  I have the things I put in my watch.
[4770.89s -> 4772.06s]  I'll just take the money.
[4777.79s -> 4779.95s]  Ever been to Boston before?
[4779.95s -> 4780.51s]  Never.
[4780.51s -> 4782.27s]  I heard it's a pretty cool place.
[4782.27s -> 4786.19s]  I live in Vegas, so I don't know.
[4786.19s -> 4786.99s]  I heard it's pretty cool, though.
[4786.99s -> 4787.79s]  I heard it's a nice place.
[4788.35s -> 4789.69s]  Have fun when you go.
[4790.25s -> 4792.92s]  On the other side, isn't it?
[4794.17s -> 4795.13s]  Of course it is.
[4795.13s -> 4800.20s]  You should go to Boston.
[4800.20s -> 4800.92s]  They have pizza.
[4803.23s -> 4804.19s]  Yeah, they do.
[4804.19s -> 4806.33s]  I heard it's really good.
[4806.97s -> 4809.18s]  I heard that if you don't have it for a while,
[4809.18s -> 4810.22s]  you really start to miss it.
[4810.30s -> 4811.42s]  That's steep, man.
[4812.30s -> 4814.89s]  And you wish you could have it.
[4816.09s -> 4816.49s]  You can't.
[4817.13s -> 4818.89s]  On what I understand, what I've been told,
[4818.89s -> 4822.70s]  nothing comes close where you currently are.
[4822.70s -> 4823.66s]  Nothing comes close.
[4826.59s -> 4828.91s]  Prince, you hate me, don't you?
[4829.63s -> 4831.15s]  I don't hate you.
[4831.15s -> 4832.59s]  I just don't like you is all.
[4833.31s -> 4835.87s]  That counts as being in the hate category.
[4835.87s -> 4837.23s]  But what would you know, huh?
[4838.19s -> 4839.23s]  You making fun of me?
[4839.79s -> 4842.03s]  I'm just being honest.
[4842.03s -> 4845.07s]  Listen, value those who tell you the truth.
[4845.79s -> 4848.83s]  Nobody speaks their mind in front of the prince.
[4848.83s -> 4849.33s]  What?
[4850.27s -> 4854.59s]  The people always say nice, happy things to you.
[4854.59s -> 4857.63s]  But they're either talking shit behind your back
[4857.63s -> 4859.87s]  or they're knocking on you to the king.
[4859.87s -> 4860.99s]  Definitely.
[4860.99s -> 4862.59s]  One hundred percent.
[4863.47s -> 4864.35s]  Is this true?
[4864.99s -> 4869.15s]  If you don't believe me, set up some cameras or something.
[4869.15s -> 4871.15s]  This shit is not okay.
[4872.11s -> 4873.55s]  I'm going to execute them all.
[4874.19s -> 4876.91s]  Hey, now, calm down, Prince.
[4876.91s -> 4879.39s]  That's textbook spoiled rich kid talk.
[4880.11s -> 4880.75s]  Let it go.
[4881.47s -> 4882.27s]  Bernie Sanders?
[4882.27s -> 4884.27s]  Or give your enemies and make them your friends.
[4884.83s -> 4885.63s]  Oh, it's not.
[4885.63s -> 4887.95s]  That's how a real leader does it.
[4889.31s -> 4890.27s]  Vanishing point.
[4890.91s -> 4892.51s]  Will you keep being honest with me?
[4893.23s -> 4896.35s]  Prince, I couldn't bullshit you even if I wanted.
[4897.31s -> 4900.27s]  No, that's like vendor in Gadgetzan.
[4900.27s -> 4901.23s]  With me, too.
[4901.95s -> 4902.43s]  Come on.
[4917.04s -> 4918.08s]  I love that voice, though.
[4918.08s -> 4920.01s]  That like, hey, come on.
[4920.01s -> 4920.49s]  What do you got?
[4920.49s -> 4921.61s]  This game for you.
[4921.61s -> 4932.17s]  The hell is it?
[4932.17s -> 4935.21s]  Jimmy Love?
[4935.21s -> 4936.41s]  It's for Kimmy's concert.
[4937.21s -> 4939.05s]  It's an invitation to the VIP seats.
[4939.69s -> 4940.57s]  Oh, shit.
[4941.29s -> 4942.49s]  It's huge.
[4942.49s -> 4944.57s]  Do you know her or something?
[4944.57s -> 4945.77s]  Who the hell is that?
[4945.77s -> 4947.85s]  Recently, they say she's even bigger than Taylor.
[4948.41s -> 4949.29s]  Yeah, she's famous.
[4949.29s -> 4950.33s]  I got that.
[4950.33s -> 4952.17s]  This already sounds hella sketchy.
[4952.17s -> 4953.77s]  Why are they doing this?
[4953.77s -> 4955.21s]  Listen, just play along.
[4955.55s -> 4956.83s]  Accept the invitation.
[4956.83s -> 4959.07s]  Otherwise, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
[4959.07s -> 4963.23s]  Beast, this culture is some serious shit.
[4963.23s -> 4966.27s]  If it's serious shit, more reason to say screw it.
[4966.99s -> 4971.84s]  It's like a weird thing to have.
[4971.84s -> 4973.04s]  The next prince assassin is Vanishing Point.
[4974.52s -> 4977.48s]  An alien criminal who steals memories.
[4977.48s -> 4980.44s]  This should turn out to be a real battle of the minds.
[4981.40s -> 4983.08s]  Hey, call before you show up.
[4983.80s -> 4984.60s]  What?
[4984.60s -> 4987.08s]  Is there something you do not want me to see?
[4987.08s -> 4988.28s]  Is this also part of the review?
[4988.28s -> 4989.00s]  Yeah.
[4989.00s -> 4991.20s]  Subscribe to your channel, you know.
[4991.20s -> 4992.80s]  The recipe stuff you do is awesome.
[4993.44s -> 4994.83s]  For tips all the time.
[4995.71s -> 4997.39s]  I feel like this was just pulled transcript
[4997.39s -> 4999.47s]  right from whatever review they're parodying.
[5000.83s -> 5003.72s]  It really should be me doing it, but...
[5003.72s -> 5004.68s]  Diversity.
[5004.68s -> 5005.40s]  Diversity.
[5009.16s -> 5013.32s]  But diversity is something people say at times like this, right?
[5014.12s -> 5016.92s]  Are you acting as an agent for the ranking battles?
[5017.72s -> 5021.08s]  Prince Fu has formed a business alliance with the UAA.
[5021.72s -> 5023.24s]  So as the head organizer,
[5023.24s -> 5024.68s]  I can move around freely.
[5025.32s -> 5028.36s]  They say to keep your enemies close, right?
[5028.36s -> 5029.80s]  They're talking about real movies.
[5029.80s -> 5030.44s]  It's not the...
[5030.44s -> 5031.80s]  I thought the reviews were real too.
[5032.68s -> 5040.51s]  Appreciate everything.
[5040.51s -> 5042.19s]  For reals, I mean it.
[5042.19s -> 5043.31s]  Okay, whatever.
[5044.19s -> 5046.83s]  Accept this invitation and go to the concert.
[5047.63s -> 5048.99s]  Vanishing Point will be there.
[5049.71s -> 5051.39s]  Anyway, I'm kind of in a hurry.
[5053.32s -> 5055.08s]  Wait, we're not done talking.
[5055.08s -> 5056.36s]  Okay, email me then.
[5057.56s -> 5058.36s]  Don't you want a beer?
[5058.36s -> 5058.86s]  Hold up.
[5062.41s -> 5064.17s]  Not real reviews.
[5064.17s -> 5065.37s]  I don't know why someone said that.
[5065.37s -> 5066.49s]  Did I get one guide?
[5067.29s -> 5069.69s]  Because yesterday people said there was real reviews.
[5070.41s -> 5072.32s]  It was more than one guy.
[5072.32s -> 5074.08s]  It was a lot of guys that said that.
[5076.52s -> 5077.32s]  All right, 20.
[5078.20s -> 5080.35s]  I have to get 20.
[5081.07s -> 5083.31s]  I refuse to leave if I don't get at least 20.
[5091.95s -> 5092.67s]  You were tricked.
[5102.83s -> 5103.63s]  Accounts.
[5103.63s -> 5105.93s]  Double the debt if you don't get the 20.
[5105.93s -> 5107.05s]  No, we're not doing that.
[5108.09s -> 5111.37s]  Once you get to 12, 15, 16, it becomes impossible.
[5113.72s -> 5116.28s]  I gotta treat this like I treat Stacker in the arcade.
[5116.28s -> 5117.88s]  It's just on the first go through, right?
[5117.88s -> 5118.60s]  Immediately.
[5118.60s -> 5120.28s]  Don't give it a chance to fuck with you.
[5120.28s -> 5121.48s]  Just the first pass.
[5121.48s -> 5126.03s]  Hey, that's the Stacker strategy to how you get the major prize every time.
[5128.76s -> 5130.20s]  Don't even let it do it.
[5130.20s -> 5131.96s]  Don't let it go over because then it gets in your head.
[5131.96s -> 5133.40s]  Just the first movement it does.
[5134.28s -> 5137.40s]  Okay, well it baited me a little bit and they got my Stacker strategy they heard about.
[5139.48s -> 5140.36s]  What's up, huh?
[5141.32s -> 5142.12s]  Stacker is rigged.
[5142.12s -> 5142.60s]  I know it is.
[5150.20s -> 5152.52s]  But if it goes past it on the first pass, you gotta do it.
[5152.52s -> 5158.89s]  All right, now that strategy is out of the way.
[5163.60s -> 5164.24s]  Shit.
[5164.24s -> 5165.52s]  This is so hard.
[5165.52s -> 5167.68s]  I have to get 20 or I'm not getting up from this.
[5167.68s -> 5168.24s]  I promise.
[5168.24s -> 5169.12s]  I swear to God.
[5169.12s -> 5170.00s]  What's the matter?
[5170.00s -> 5170.72s]  Steady your hand.
[5170.72s -> 5171.36s]  I'm not doing that.
[5173.84s -> 5174.48s]  All right, it's all right.
[5174.48s -> 5175.04s]  I'll get 20.
[5175.04s -> 5177.85s]  Where are you sleeping?
[5177.85s -> 5179.34s]  This is boring.
[5179.34s -> 5181.74s]  All right, like Chattered 500 whatever.
[5185.02s -> 5185.42s]  20.
[5191.45s -> 5193.29s]  Don't yikes me right now.
[5193.29s -> 5196.65s]  Okay, I'm restarting that because somebody yikes me.
[5211.93s -> 5212.25s]  20.
[5213.05s -> 5214.25s]  I've hit 17.
[5214.25s -> 5214.97s]  I can hit 20.
[5215.53s -> 5216.17s]  Don't be an idiot.
[5216.17s -> 5216.97s]  Just be smart about it.
[5224.17s -> 5225.13s]  Don't blame chat.
[5226.65s -> 5227.05s]  I am.
[5228.49s -> 5231.44s]  The debt will be cleared if you watch Cromwell on stream.
[5231.44s -> 5232.64s]  Well, that would be illegal.
[5232.64s -> 5239.28s]  So no, I would rather have fake debt to a chat room of friends and family members.
[5240.11s -> 5240.91s]  I'm not a you afraid.
[5241.79s -> 5242.59s]  No, just wait.
[5242.59s -> 5242.99s]  Hold on.
[5243.63s -> 5245.07s]  I'm a family.
[5246.11s -> 5247.55s]  I just fucked myself over here.
[5247.55s -> 5249.15s]  I just I just fucked everything up here.
[5250.28s -> 5252.60s]  I just created a huge problem right here.
[5252.60s -> 5255.80s]  Do you understand how much of a problem I just caused myself right now?
[5259.31s -> 5263.23s]  Just a single little offhanded comment just created a huge amount of problems.
[5263.23s -> 5263.95s]  Okay, so listen.
[5266.03s -> 5266.75s]  What was I saying?
[5266.75s -> 5270.03s]  Okay, having a debt on my channel is a joke.
[5270.03s -> 5274.99s]  Is not as good as having debt with lawyers and actually getting into real debt because
[5274.99s -> 5281.63s]  I get sued from like fucking Paramount Pictures for watching a licensed TV movie on my stream.
[5281.63s -> 5282.35s]  That's illegal.
[5290.86s -> 5291.58s]  Too late.
[5291.58s -> 5292.62s]  We're family now.
[5294.52s -> 5295.96s]  The debt isn't a joke.
[5298.03s -> 5305.87s]  Okay, but you understand like you and I as acquaintances as online entertainment acquaintances.
[5305.87s -> 5306.43s]  I'm not a look.
[5306.43s -> 5306.91s]  Listen to me.
[5307.23s -> 5308.43s]  Listen, I'm going to give it to you real.
[5309.47s -> 5311.47s]  I can't call everybody my friend.
[5311.47s -> 5311.95s]  I don't know.
[5311.95s -> 5313.55s]  I don't know how half of you guys.
[5313.55s -> 5315.15s]  No, that implies I know half of you guys.
[5315.15s -> 5316.27s]  I don't fucking know any of you guys.
[5316.83s -> 5318.59s]  I don't know anybody here.
[5318.59s -> 5320.43s]  I know like I don't think eight of you.
[5321.79s -> 5323.39s]  Paralegal, parasocial.
[5323.39s -> 5324.03s]  No, listen.
[5325.72s -> 5328.04s]  I just fucked it up and I'm into like a 20.
[5328.04s -> 5329.72s]  I'm not I'm not leaving until I get 20.
[5331.72s -> 5332.68s]  He hates us.
[5332.68s -> 5340.73s]  No, paralegal, paralegal, parasocial.
[5340.73s -> 5341.53s]  Come on.
[5341.53s -> 5342.49s]  What's the matter?
[5342.49s -> 5343.53s]  How does Mike know?
[5343.53s -> 5344.17s]  All right.
[5344.17s -> 5344.97s]  What's up, huh?
[5354.43s -> 5355.80s]  All right, we're good.
[5358.48s -> 5361.61s]  Yeah, I thought we were family.
[5363.90s -> 5366.62s]  This is my favorite one of these comments.
[5366.62s -> 5367.90s]  I thought we had something.
[5367.90s -> 5369.18s]  I know not hold on.
[5369.18s -> 5369.90s]  I got to read it.
[5369.90s -> 5371.98s]  I make sure I get it right because it's funny.
[5371.98s -> 5372.70s]  What's up, huh?
[5374.22s -> 5375.74s]  I thought we had something.
[5375.74s -> 5377.74s]  I can understand the other people but me.
[5378.62s -> 5379.68s]  I like that.
[5380.32s -> 5381.20s]  That's funny.
[5381.20s -> 5381.68s]  What's up?
[5382.72s -> 5383.92s]  Family is everything.
[5393.39s -> 5394.99s]  Where's my Christmas present?
[5394.99s -> 5395.79s]  Family member.
[5404.92s -> 5406.84s]  You don't turn your back on family.
[5409.48s -> 5411.08s]  Paranormal relationship.
[5417.79s -> 5419.47s]  I invited you to my birthday party.
[5420.19s -> 5420.75s]  What's the matter?
[5420.75s -> 5422.75s]  You see how hard this gets after 10.
[5422.75s -> 5423.63s]  20 is insane.
[5432.56s -> 5434.40s]  All right, we're on a good pace here.
[5434.40s -> 5435.04s]  I got three lives.
[5435.04s -> 5438.75s]  What's up, huh?
[5438.75s -> 5439.25s]  Yeah.
[5443.50s -> 5444.00s]  Nice.
[5444.70s -> 5445.98s]  Just use the stacker technique.
[5445.98s -> 5446.70s]  It works every time.
[5448.67s -> 5451.79s]  I had it but I second guessed myself in the last quarter of a second.
[5451.79s -> 5452.29s]  All right, come on.
[5458.65s -> 5459.77s]  What's up, huh?
[5459.77s -> 5460.49s]  20, let's go.
[5463.96s -> 5464.44s]  Is that in there?
[5464.44s -> 5465.24s]  What's the matter?
[5465.24s -> 5465.74s]  Ah.
[5467.10s -> 5472.27s]  Where are you?
[5472.27s -> 5472.99s]  What's up, huh?
[5475.42s -> 5476.22s]  Come on.
[5476.22s -> 5481.04s]  That's fucking with me.
[5481.04s -> 5481.76s]  Come on.
[5481.76s -> 5482.26s]  Bring it.
[5484.53s -> 5485.03s]  Shit.
[5485.65s -> 5486.77s]  One more try.
[5486.77s -> 5487.81s]  What's up, huh?
[5487.81s -> 5488.05s]  All right.
[5488.05s -> 5488.85s]  I'm 35.
[5488.85s -> 5489.09s]  Don't...
[5489.09s -> 5490.37s]  What am I acting like that for?
[5491.25s -> 5491.65s]  Shit.
[5491.65s -> 5492.37s]  Stomping my feet.
[5492.37s -> 5492.77s]  What am I?
[5492.77s -> 5493.17s]  12.
[5493.17s -> 5493.49s]  Let's go.
[5493.49s -> 5495.98s]  Come on.
[5495.98s -> 5497.34s]  Last try is pretty good.
[5497.34s -> 5499.79s]  What's up, huh?
[5513.17s -> 5514.53s]  Isn't your birthday Hobbit Day?
[5514.53s -> 5516.21s]  I want that person banned permanently.
[5516.21s -> 5517.65s]  Permanently.
[5519.25s -> 5520.37s]  And then I want them unbanned.
[5520.37s -> 5523.41s]  And then I want them timed out for 10 seconds.
[5534.86s -> 5538.59s]  That's an old joke.
[5538.59s -> 5539.15s]  Minus two.
[5540.91s -> 5541.87s]  But it's a good one.
[5550.32s -> 5550.64s]  All right.
[5550.64s -> 5551.28s]  Back up to 10.
[5552.08s -> 5553.04s]  This is my last try.
[5553.04s -> 5554.16s]  If I don't get to 20 then whatever.
[5554.16s -> 5554.96s]  I get a game to play.
[5561.98s -> 5562.46s]  Come on.
[5562.46s -> 5563.58s]  That's such a bullshit.
[5563.58s -> 5564.22s]  Come on.
[5564.22s -> 5565.02s]  What's the matter?
[5565.02s -> 5565.90s]  Where are you aiming?
[5567.63s -> 5568.67s]  Come on.
[5568.67s -> 5569.17s]  Bring it.
[5569.71s -> 5571.39s]  That's in.
[5571.47s -> 5571.97s]  Yeah.
[5577.14s -> 5577.94s]  What's up, huh?
[5578.58s -> 5579.30s]  I'm gonna be quiet.
[5581.36s -> 5581.86s]  It's in.
[5586.80s -> 5587.30s]  That's in.
[5592.51s -> 5592.91s]  Shit.
[5592.91s -> 5594.51s]  I thought it was gonna move really fast.
[5596.48s -> 5604.93s]  What's the matter?
[5604.93s -> 5605.57s]  Holy fuck.
[5605.57s -> 5606.45s]  This is impossible.
[5608.82s -> 5609.78s]  Actually impossible.
[5609.78s -> 5610.66s]  You just didn't get lucky.
[5611.70s -> 5612.10s]  All right.
[5612.10s -> 5613.14s]  This is my last attempt.
[5613.14s -> 5613.64s]  I swear.
[5619.38s -> 5619.88s]  What's up?
[5630.95s -> 5632.95s]  I'm not talking at all until I get it.
[5635.01s -> 5637.20s]  I just have to lean in.
[5637.20s -> 5639.52s]  Just stare and not say any words and just focus.
[5642.26s -> 5643.06s]  Yeah.
[5643.06s -> 5644.07s]  Come on.
[5644.07s -> 5644.57s]  Bring it.
[5653.20s -> 5653.70s]  Yeah.
[5654.32s -> 5655.12s]  What's up, huh?
[5658.72s -> 5659.22s]  Meow.
[5659.76s -> 5661.20s]  I added a game designed for cats.
[5665.59s -> 5666.07s]  All right.
[5666.07s -> 5666.57s]  Here we go.
[5668.39s -> 5668.89s]  Meow.
[5683.51s -> 5684.47s]  Where are you aiming?
[5695.78s -> 5696.58s]  Come on.
[5696.58s -> 5697.30s]  What's the matter?
[5700.26s -> 5700.76s]  It's in.
[5701.70s -> 5702.34s]  It's in.
[5702.34s -> 5703.06s]  Right on the edge.
[5703.06s -> 5703.62s]  That's in.
[5703.62s -> 5704.42s]  Right in the corner.
[5704.42s -> 5705.22s]  Paint to the corners.
[5730.10s -> 5733.92s]  Get the fuck in there.
[5733.92s -> 5734.42s]  Two more.
[5738.16s -> 5741.28s]  I thought it was gonna go right across immediately.
[5741.28s -> 5741.60s]  All right.
[5741.60s -> 5742.24s]  Come on.
[5742.24s -> 5742.88s]  18's enough.
[5743.52s -> 5744.64s]  It rounds up to 20.
[5744.64s -> 5745.36s]  What's the matter?
[5750.40s -> 5751.60s]  You stupid game.
[5751.60s -> 5752.48s]  You dumb game.
[5752.48s -> 5753.04s]  One more.
[5753.04s -> 5753.60s]  No.
[5753.60s -> 5754.10s]  Fuck.
[5761.06s -> 5763.01s]  What's up, huh?
[5763.01s -> 5763.51s]  Come on.
[5764.68s -> 5768.56s]  I'm just getting so goddamn mad.
[5768.56s -> 5770.96s]  I'm just like gonna start punching my fucking desk.
[5770.96s -> 5772.00s]  Punch the desk.
[5772.00s -> 5772.80s]  Punch the desk.
[5776.72s -> 5777.76s]  I'm so sick of this.
[5778.40s -> 5780.40s]  I'm so sick of this.
[5797.19s -> 5797.69s]  Acting.
[5814.48s -> 5815.36s]  I just joined the stream.
[5815.36s -> 5815.92s]  Hey, what's going on?
[5815.92s -> 5816.56s]  How are you?
[5816.56s -> 5817.80s]  Good to see you.
[5817.80s -> 5819.62s]  That was Tommy Wiseau.
[5824.48s -> 5826.80s]  Paranormal streamer pretends for likes.
[5839.94s -> 5841.38s]  This is a pretty good run so far.
[5841.38s -> 5843.14s]  I haven't missed.
[5843.14s -> 5845.51s]  Bingo.
[5845.51s -> 5846.15s]  We're at 14.
[5846.95s -> 5847.51s]  Three lives.
[5847.51s -> 5847.83s]  Let's go.
[5847.83s -> 5848.31s]  This is the one.
[5850.40s -> 5850.80s]  That's in.
[5855.49s -> 5856.44s]  All right.
[5856.44s -> 5856.92s]  We're fine.
[5883.49s -> 5883.99s]  Ah.
[5883.99s -> 5884.49s]  Ah.
[5884.49s -> 5884.99s]  Ah.
[5884.99s -> 5885.49s]  Ah.
[5894.79s -> 5899.88s]  That's it.
[5899.88s -> 5900.28s]  Done.
[5900.28s -> 5900.78s]  I win.
[5901.48s -> 5902.12s]  Good game.
[5902.12s -> 5902.62s]  20.
[5905.48s -> 5906.28s]  That's impossible.
[5906.28s -> 5907.48s]  That's literally not completable.
[5907.48s -> 5907.98s]  I'm done.
[5910.10s -> 5911.30s]  That's not possible to get that.
[5911.86s -> 5912.66s]  Look at how small that is.
[5913.30s -> 5914.93s]  What's up, huh?
[5914.93s -> 5916.20s]  I got to 20.
[5916.20s -> 5916.92s]  That's what I wanted.
[5917.48s -> 5921.88s]  That not worth anything?
[5922.52s -> 5924.47s]  Really?
[5924.47s -> 5936.95s]  Get a 50 high score to clear the debt.
[5936.95s -> 5939.27s]  That's not possible, man.
[5939.27s -> 5939.77s]  Sorry.
[5940.23s -> 5944.45s]  25 is a t-shirt.
[5944.45s -> 5948.31s]  You just decided that 20 was an arbitrary number.
[5948.31s -> 5950.15s]  But doesn't 20 sound like a number?
[5950.79s -> 5953.48s]  First of all, 10 sounds like a number to get something.
[5953.48s -> 5955.16s]  20 sounds like a number to get something cool.
[5955.89s -> 5959.09s]  And then something like crazy like 50 is just,
[5959.09s -> 5962.53s]  oh, you get the achievement and you get like a t-shirt or something, right?
[5962.53s -> 5971.38s]  The prize is at 51.
[5973.56s -> 5974.10s]  All right.
[5974.10s -> 5974.82s]  What am I upgrading here?
[5974.82s -> 5975.78s]  I got a lot of money.
[5975.78s -> 5980.63s]  What should it be?
[5981.51s -> 5983.75s]  I'm thinking attack power.
[5984.31s -> 5987.96s]  Definitely attack power.
[5987.96s -> 5988.84s]  I got 79.
[5989.56s -> 5990.61s]  Did I get the charge?
[5991.25s -> 5993.09s]  I feel like I wouldn't use this this much, though.
[5993.81s -> 5996.93s]  I would use the double dodge.
[5997.57s -> 6001.46s]  More battery, yeah.
[6002.02s -> 6009.48s]  Do I have enough?
[6010.04s -> 6011.24s]  Yeah, I could do another attack.
[6011.80s -> 6012.76s]  Yeah, I want another attack.
[6018.16s -> 6021.76s]  2,000 left.
[6021.76s -> 6023.36s]  Is that enough for 36?
[6023.36s -> 6024.40s]  Yeah, I can do health.
[6027.84s -> 6029.89s]  Cool.
[6029.89s -> 6031.94s]  All right, good.
[6031.94s -> 6039.09s]  I don't think I got any new chips that I want to put in.
[6039.73s -> 6041.80s]  We'll see.
[6042.60s -> 6051.08s]  Is this new?
[6051.72s -> 6053.03s]  Oh, this one's new.
[6059.03s -> 6061.03s]  Death force attack power 10% higher.
[6063.43s -> 6065.51s]  Death slow duration 10% up.
[6067.16s -> 6067.72s]  I like that.
[6067.72s -> 6068.68s]  That's my favorite one, I think.
[6069.24s -> 6070.18s]  Out of the kick.
[6070.90s -> 6075.49s]  When health is at 20% or lower, weapon attack is...
[6076.61s -> 6078.45s]  This is worded weirdly from my brain.
[6078.45s -> 6082.53s]  When health is at 20% or below, weapon attack power 15% up.
[6082.53s -> 6091.80s]  Okay, now I already have one of these.
[6092.44s -> 6096.85s]  During slow down after a perfect dodge.
[6097.24s -> 6098.44s]  That's good, but not enough.
[6098.44s -> 6100.28s]  I would want it to be like 30%.
[6100.28s -> 6101.24s]  I'd get three of those.
[6101.96s -> 6108.53s]  Oh, I think I'm good for the chips right now.
[6109.09s -> 6114.74s]  It's like tanky.
[6114.74s -> 6117.72s]  Okay, I think that's fine.
[6117.72s -> 6118.76s]  I think the ones I have are good.
[6119.56s -> 6127.08s]  I do want health.
[6127.08s -> 6131.91s]  Definitely always have this maxed out.
[6131.91s -> 6133.59s]  It's just estuses essentially at this point.
[6134.71s -> 6135.99s]  I have not even used this.
[6140.85s -> 6142.69s]  I can look at my menu, my quick menu, right?
[6143.25s -> 6144.61s]  Because I haven't even used any of those.
[6148.55s -> 6149.67s]  Special move, okay.
[6150.39s -> 6152.13s]  This is my sushi.
[6152.13s -> 6153.17s]  How can I tell...
[6153.17s -> 6154.21s]  Can I see like of the menu?
[6155.09s -> 6162.34s]  No, is there a way I can tell...
[6162.34s -> 6166.16s]  What's mapped to what?
[6166.16s -> 6167.68s]  I don't know what's mapped to what.
[6167.68s -> 6168.64s]  You can only see it in battle.
[6169.36s -> 6170.90s]  Oh well, okay.
[6170.90s -> 6171.78s]  Well, I got what I wanted.
[6172.42s -> 6174.98s]  I might actually eat one of the actual eat-in ones.
[6175.54s -> 6176.45s]  You know what I mean?
[6178.24s -> 6178.88s]  For this fight.
[6179.60s -> 6184.82s]  How's everybody doing?
[6184.82s -> 6187.86s]  Master, master.
[6188.58s -> 6188.98s]  It's me.
[6188.98s -> 6190.02s]  I'm right here.
[6190.02s -> 6191.78s]  Genoba, wake up.
[6191.78s -> 6194.26s]  I'll teach you a super special suplex.
[6194.26s -> 6196.21s]  Hurry up and wake up.
[6196.21s -> 6197.41s]  Let's get training.
[6197.41s -> 6199.17s]  My favorite suplex is...
[6199.17s -> 6201.01s]  It's got to be the one that Maeda used
[6201.01s -> 6203.73s]  to take down Ordolf with a reverse arm assault.
[6203.73s -> 6206.15s]  When he made his triumphant return from Europe as
[6206.15s -> 6207.99s]  Quick Kick Lee.
[6207.99s -> 6211.30s]  Fleeting beauty of that bridge in Parabola.
[6211.30s -> 6214.66s]  Genoba, remember how that moment felt.
[6226.52s -> 6229.24s]  Paris Parabola relationship.
[6229.24s -> 6230.36s]  Parasocial, whatever.
[6231.94s -> 6233.14s]  Oh, it's Gene.
[6235.40s -> 6235.90s]  Gene?
[6236.52s -> 6243.11s]  Not interested.
[6243.67s -> 6245.22s]  Not interested, what?
[6245.22s -> 6248.47s]  Try it again.
[6248.47s -> 6248.97s]  Gene?
[6255.99s -> 6256.71s]  No, doesn't care.
[6259.54s -> 6260.26s]  Okay.
[6260.26s -> 6271.06s]  All right, time for rank battle.
[6271.06s -> 6274.23s]  Versus the memory guy.
[6274.87s -> 6281.16s]  Stop having a parasocial relationship with your cat.
[6287.01s -> 6292.39s]  All right, I'm going to get sushi.
[6292.95s -> 6300.15s]  True.
[6300.15s -> 6301.27s]  What do you mean true?
[6301.27s -> 6306.66s]  Okay, sushi time.
[6306.66s -> 6308.50s]  Should I do that first?
[6313.83s -> 6315.99s]  Will that last all through to my next battle or something?
[6315.99s -> 6317.67s]  Or should I buy it right before the boss door?
[6318.23s -> 6320.47s]  I would assume right before the boss door, right?
[6321.11s -> 6330.05s]  Yeah, I'll just buy it there.
[6330.05s -> 6340.44s]  Perfect world.
[6341.00s -> 6372.42s]  Is he finally playing the game?
[6375.17s -> 6378.85s]  Yeah, I mean, I've been just kind of grinding money.
[6378.85s -> 6383.68s]  You practice that off stream for at least 20 minutes.
[6383.68s -> 6385.44s]  Nope, not even one second.
[6386.00s -> 6388.69s]  Or maybe a few seconds.
[6388.69s -> 6389.57s]  Maybe like two seconds.
[6389.57s -> 6391.81s]  That did sound very practiced and rehearsed, didn't it?
[6391.81s -> 6393.57s]  But I didn't, I can assure you.
[6393.57s -> 6403.28s]  This is weird.
[6410.18s -> 6412.61s]  All right, I'm buying one of the Eden ones.
[6412.61s -> 6413.73s]  They're expensive, but I'm going to do it.
[6418.07s -> 6419.35s]  This one's really expensive.
[6419.35s -> 6420.79s]  Okay, if you die, you come back to life.
[6420.79s -> 6421.99s]  That's a lot of money though.
[6423.08s -> 6425.00s]  Greatly increased health and attack power.
[6425.80s -> 6430.53s]  Okay, this is just a chef's choice, who knows?
[6431.09s -> 6435.17s]  Maybe he's more easily stunned.
[6436.76s -> 6437.56s]  I'll just go with this one.
[6442.44s -> 6442.94s]  Yeah.
[6443.84s -> 6446.32s]  Enter into battle with a greatly increased health and attack power.
[6446.88s -> 6449.75s]  It's very expensive, but I'm going to do it.
[6450.31s -> 6454.84s]  I think it's worth it.
[6461.84s -> 6470.66s]  Can you say your stream title out loud so I know what it means?
[6471.54s -> 6472.63s]  Sure.
[6472.63s -> 6473.35s]  It's hey there.
[6478.31s -> 6490.24s]  It's the seal video of the seal talking.
[6490.24s -> 6500.61s]  And that really cleared it up.
[6500.61s -> 6501.11s]  Thanks.
[6501.92s -> 6502.42s]  Anytime.
[6504.84s -> 6506.44s]  Okay, it's time for a fight.
[6507.32s -> 6507.82s]  Action.
[6536.85s -> 6537.35s]  Wait, what?
[6542.37s -> 6542.87s]  Whoa.
[6552.08s -> 6552.72s]  Oh, shit.
[6557.41s -> 6558.77s]  It happened again?
[6558.77s -> 6560.53s]  One back to back?
[6561.33s -> 6580.24s]  Aren't all these guys supposed to be Thanos level threats?
[6580.24s -> 6586.64s]  What is he doing up here?
[6586.64s -> 6601.89s]  This is the high school girl from the second game.
[6602.53s -> 6603.03s]  Is it?
[6616.85s -> 6619.88s]  Oh, do I have to go?
[6621.65s -> 6632.42s]  We need a voice crack.
[6632.42s -> 6634.18s]  I need a voice crack right now.
[6635.06s -> 6636.90s]  Please, please suit him.
[6647.48s -> 6647.98s]  He did.
[6662.08s -> 6662.58s]  He did.
[6689.40s -> 6691.72s]  This is so, this is so, this is all, this is insane.
[6704.16s -> 6706.16s]  This time we fight to the death.
[6706.16s -> 6706.88s]  Yeah, bitch.
[6708.21s -> 6708.71s]  Fuckhead.
[6711.16s -> 6712.12s]  Wait, what?
[6712.92s -> 6713.42s]  What?
[6714.52s -> 6715.48s]  This is so stupid.
[6722.45s -> 6723.33s]  This is insane.
[6725.25s -> 6728.21s]  That was, I don't even know, I can't even process what just happened.
[6728.21s -> 6729.89s]  He actually had a voice crack.
[6734.10s -> 6734.60s]  Oh, God.
[6738.88s -> 6739.38s]  Yeah.
[6742.77s -> 6743.27s]  Where?
[6746.48s -> 6747.76s]  Oh, they explode.
[6747.76s -> 6748.26s]  Okay.
[6750.98s -> 6751.70s]  Taffy, quick.
[6752.50s -> 6753.94s]  He just snapped my neck.
[6771.12s -> 6772.16s]  Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[6772.16s -> 6772.64s]  Everything's good.
[6779.44s -> 6786.93s]  God, I need to do some dodging, man.
[6786.93s -> 6787.97s]  I'm not dodging anything.
[6798.56s -> 6799.60s]  All right, let's go.
[6799.60s -> 6800.24s]  Nice and easy.
[6801.36s -> 6801.86s]  Get in here.
[6802.56s -> 6807.78s]  Oh.
[6811.17s -> 6812.69s]  Oh, mustang pod, it's over.
[6815.73s -> 6818.15s]  Oh, my God.
[6818.87s -> 6827.06s]  Holy shit.
[6827.06s -> 6828.50s]  I don't even know what's happening.
[6828.50s -> 6829.14s]  I'm still swinging.
[6829.14s -> 6830.18s]  She's in a cut scene.
[6836.04s -> 6836.54s]  What?
[6837.83s -> 6838.71s]  Oh, my God.
[6839.51s -> 6844.08s]  Oh, shit.
[6844.08s -> 6845.12s]  I'm dying down here.
[6851.41s -> 6851.89s]  Holy shit.
[6851.89s -> 6852.53s]  Do I guard?
[6852.53s -> 6853.17s]  Can I block it?
[6854.21s -> 6855.17s]  No, I can't block it.
[6856.05s -> 6862.36s]  Is she back?
[6862.82s -> 6864.84s]  Ow.
[6869.27s -> 6870.79s]  This view is insane.
[6871.75s -> 6872.79s]  No, not this shit again.
[6875.67s -> 6876.17s]  Hey.
[6877.67s -> 6878.17s]  Get out of here.
[6882.52s -> 6883.02s]  Got it.
[6888.24s -> 6888.74s]  Game over.
[6893.64s -> 6894.14s]  Got it.
[6894.20s -> 6894.70s]  Is she dead?
[6895.24s -> 6895.74s]  She's over here.
[6896.36s -> 6897.67s]  See you later.
[6898.45s -> 6900.92s]  That was crazy.
[6901.48s -> 6902.76s]  That was fucking crazy.
[6903.56s -> 6914.85s]  Yeah, and it was diamond cutter.
[6914.85s -> 6939.33s]  Let's just goodbye.
[6943.14s -> 6943.64s]  Damn.
[6943.94s -> 6946.36s]  Oh, my goodness gracious.
[6953.40s -> 6955.32s]  I'm so overstimulated right now.
[6956.04s -> 6957.80s]  First of all, they pulled the
[6957.80s -> 6959.64s]  it's not this boss, it's this other guy.
[6961.51s -> 6963.11s]  At this point, I'm assuming that
[6963.11s -> 6964.79s]  all the people in Fu's party
[6964.79s -> 6966.63s]  are just dudes they found at the subway
[6966.63s -> 6968.31s]  that are in fucking Halloween costumes.
[6969.03s -> 6971.01s]  No, they haven't done anything.
[6971.01s -> 6982.61s]  All right, that's B.
[6982.61s -> 6988.31s]  I'll take a B.
[6988.31s -> 6989.43s]  Oh, I got a CD.
[6998.32s -> 6999.28s]  Congratulations.
[6999.28s -> 7001.28s]  That was the most wild one yet.
[7001.28s -> 7002.48s]  You were recognized as number seven
[7002.48s -> 7003.92s]  in the galactic rankings.
[7004.96s -> 7006.56s]  And just look at this kid.
[7006.56s -> 7009.04s]  I guess she just could not grow up after all.
[7009.60s -> 7012.15s]  This is the last time I kill a woman.
[7013.68s -> 7015.04s]  Well, how kind of you.
[7015.04s -> 7016.72s]  Don't ever hit a girl.
[7016.72s -> 7018.32s]  My grandma used to tell me that.
[7019.92s -> 7020.80s]  What are you?
[7020.80s -> 7022.40s]  A good Samaritan now?
[7022.40s -> 7023.84s]  How far do you think that kind of
[7023.84s -> 7025.04s]  posing will get you?
[7025.60s -> 7027.20s]  Kimi wasn't supposed to be a
[7027.20s -> 7027.68s]  They're just cheering.
[7027.68s -> 7029.04s]  Aren't they fans?
[7029.04s -> 7031.68s]  I'm only after those fucking alien assholes.
[7031.68s -> 7032.88s]  I never signed up for this.
[7033.60s -> 7034.96s]  The strong survive.
[7035.84s -> 7038.40s]  That is how the world of killing works.
[7038.40s -> 7040.00s]  You have not forgotten, have you?
[7041.08s -> 7043.24s]  Did you think you were going to become friends
[7043.24s -> 7046.20s]  and team up to defeat the big, mean aliens?
[7047.08s -> 7048.04s]  This is not a superhero.
[7048.04s -> 7049.16s]  They have glow sticks.
[7049.16s -> 7050.28s]  It is not that simple.
[7050.84s -> 7052.92s]  Why don't you ask your katana there?
[7052.92s -> 7055.40s]  Just how much blood it has sucked so far.
[7060.39s -> 7061.59s]  It is still too early.
[7062.47s -> 7063.51s]  Stay at the ready, though.
[7073.83s -> 7075.19s]  If I have to rank the Star Wars movies,
[7075.19s -> 7076.15s]  this is definitely number one.
[7078.05s -> 7078.61s]  Without a doubt.
[7087.67s -> 7092.88s]  No More Heroes 3 is by far the best one.
[7092.88s -> 7094.56s]  The one thing that I miss,
[7094.56s -> 7096.63s]  and this is why you play the second game,
[7097.59s -> 7100.47s]  I really, really liked the 8-bit
[7100.47s -> 7104.72s]  sort of old Nintendo-esque minigames for money.
[7104.72s -> 7105.60s]  Those are really cool
[7105.60s -> 7106.88s]  and just kind of funny and interesting.
[7106.88s -> 7109.36s]  And they're really easy to play over and over again.
[7109.36s -> 7111.89s]  It's the one thing that I really liked
[7111.89s -> 7112.85s]  in the second game.
[7112.85s -> 7120.10s]  The first game was sort of...
[7120.10s -> 7120.66s]  I don't think...
[7121.30s -> 7122.34s]  I mean, maybe they did.
[7122.34s -> 7122.66s]  I don't know.
[7122.66s -> 7123.70s]  I don't know if he thought
[7123.70s -> 7125.14s]  this was something that he was going to do later.
[7125.70s -> 7127.38s]  The first game felt like a complete package.
[7127.38s -> 7128.82s]  Just, oh, it's a Suda 51 game.
[7128.82s -> 7130.18s]  It's No More Heroes.
[7130.18s -> 7130.90s]  This is it.
[7130.90s -> 7131.22s]  Cool.
[7131.22s -> 7132.90s]  It was a fun experience and I made it.
[7132.90s -> 7135.51s]  But No More Heroes 2 and 3
[7135.51s -> 7137.35s]  and then having all these other things in the franchise.
[7138.23s -> 7141.59s]  No More Heroes 1 is this almost enclosed in its own place.
[7142.15s -> 7144.12s]  Did the game just end?
[7144.12s -> 7144.76s]  No.
[7144.76s -> 7145.08s]  No.
[7145.08s -> 7147.72s]  Those of you that were just catching the stream now, no.
[7148.28s -> 7150.71s]  It's like a fake anime.
[7151.19s -> 7152.15s]  Intros and outros.
[7169.00s -> 7170.92s]  This is by far the most fun.
[7170.92s -> 7175.62s]  And fun doesn't mean actually playing
[7175.62s -> 7177.22s]  the physical video game either, right?
[7177.22s -> 7177.78s]  A lot of times.
[7179.94s -> 7182.42s]  Fun is just the whole package sometimes.
[7182.42s -> 7183.78s]  Like watching the cutscenes and...
[7183.78s -> 7184.50s]  The color is green.
[7184.50s -> 7186.18s]  The boss fights that aren't really boss fights,
[7186.18s -> 7188.02s]  they're kind of just there to be fun and interesting.
[7188.02s -> 7190.74s]  It's not about just swinging the sword at people.
[7190.74s -> 7193.17s]  It's the most fun Star Wars movie.
[7194.45s -> 7210.85s]  So what rank...
[7210.85s -> 7211.41s]  What was it?
[7211.41s -> 7212.13s]  Rank 6?
[7212.85s -> 7216.20s]  Time for a pee break.
[7216.20s -> 7217.64s]  Actually, that's a great idea.
[7217.64s -> 7223.62s]  After this next cutscene,
[7223.62s -> 7225.11s]  we'll take a quick break.
[7225.11s -> 7227.40s]  Where's Damon?
[7227.40s -> 7230.60s]  He said he would be out on his monthly glamping trip today.
[7230.60s -> 7232.92s]  Oh, that guy is such a hassle.
[7233.72s -> 7235.72s]  What's up with Velvet Chair Girl?
[7235.72s -> 7238.12s]  She called in saying she could not make it
[7238.12s -> 7240.36s]  due to an appointment at the nail salon.
[7241.16s -> 7241.64s]  I see.
[7242.60s -> 7243.96s]  So she couldn't make it, huh?
[7244.84s -> 7246.76s]  Was it really such an important appointment?
[7248.04s -> 7249.56s]  It is for her nails, so...
[7250.76s -> 7252.60s]  Okay, I'll let this one slide.
[7252.60s -> 7255.16s]  Seriously, women are the biggest hassle of them all.
[7256.52s -> 7258.60s]  Both humans and aliens are a hassle.
[7259.84s -> 7261.20s]  You got something you want to say?
[7262.00s -> 7262.56s]  No.
[7262.56s -> 7263.60s]  My apologies for...
[7265.44s -> 7268.44s]  Oh, here it goes.
[7268.44s -> 7269.00s]  The intro.
[7269.96s -> 7271.00s]  Don't ever skip the intro.
[7271.64s -> 7275.56s]  How many times have you ever skipped an intro accidentally?
[7276.36s -> 7277.56s]  And you get pissed?
[7277.56s -> 7279.32s]  Or you're too lazy to go back and watch it,
[7279.32s -> 7282.44s]  but you're really just sort of secretly incredibly annoyed?
[7283.24s -> 7299.97s]  How do you accidentally do that?
[7299.97s -> 7300.69s]  Um, I don't know.
[7300.69s -> 7301.97s]  Sometimes you just press the button.
[7301.97s -> 7303.73s]  Sometimes, like, if you have, like, a touch screen,
[7303.73s -> 7307.46s]  or if you have, like, an Apple TV or something,
[7307.46s -> 7308.50s]  or you have, like, a remote.
[7308.50s -> 7309.86s]  No, I don't think so.
[7309.86s -> 7311.14s]  You're just hella wrong.
[7311.14s -> 7314.02s]  You accidentally press left on your console controller,
[7314.02s -> 7315.54s]  if you're doing it on, like, PS4 or PS5.
[7315.54s -> 7316.50s]  Bullshit.
[7316.50s -> 7318.42s]  Mieke never read the original.
[7318.42s -> 7320.74s]  The script is what's most important.
[7320.74s -> 7323.62s]  The script is what the entire art form is based on.
[7324.18s -> 7326.26s]  You can't make a movie without knowing the material.
[7326.90s -> 7329.70s]  Don't underestimate Mieke's love for the originals.
[7329.70s -> 7330.20s]  So...
[7330.82s -> 7333.54s]  So any old hardcore maniac can make a movie, then?
[7333.54s -> 7336.26s]  All you need to do is love the originals, right?
[7336.26s -> 7337.94s]  What about Terraformers, then, huh?
[7339.30s -> 7340.18s]  Terraformers is...
[7341.52s -> 7342.80s]  Terraformers is...
[7343.76s -> 7344.88s]  You want to watch it again?
[7345.44s -> 7346.72s]  Terraformers?
[7346.72s -> 7347.36s]  Let's do it.
[7350.79s -> 7353.38s]  Terraformers.
[7354.34s -> 7357.00s]  Oh, we got a new t-shirt.
[7361.09s -> 7361.57s]  Oh, wait.
[7361.57s -> 7362.29s]  Important.
[7362.29s -> 7362.79s]  Cat.
[7363.33s -> 7364.69s]  Cat, check wardrobe and then pee.
[7364.69s -> 7366.64s]  I gotta go on a diet.
[7366.64s -> 7367.84s]  No, I'm not throwing the ball again.
[7368.64s -> 7378.12s]  Okay.
[7378.12s -> 7379.96s]  Uh, this is with this hoodie on.
[7379.96s -> 7387.99s]  Okay.
[7388.47s -> 7390.23s]  I just want to see what the shirts look like.
[7390.23s -> 7393.26s]  Can I get new shirts?
[7400.07s -> 7400.87s]  Where is it?
[7400.87s -> 7406.98s]  Taku freak.
[7409.91s -> 7410.55s]  Flame tea.
[7411.11s -> 7411.61s]  Ooh.
[7416.28s -> 7416.92s]  Oh, there it is.
[7416.92s -> 7417.72s]  I like that one a lot.
[7423.10s -> 7424.30s]  I really like this, though.
[7424.30s -> 7425.42s]  I actually really like this.
[7425.98s -> 7428.31s]  All right.
[7428.31s -> 7430.15s]  I'm gonna wear this till I get some more clothes.
[7430.15s -> 7445.94s]  Yeah, I like it.
[7445.94s -> 7456.44s]  You did no progress and you saved.
[7456.44s -> 7458.52s]  I know. I just do it because I sometimes do.
[7458.52s -> 7462.20s]  I just like it's like a nervous habit in a way.
[7462.20s -> 7463.40s]  Just like, okay, save, press button.
[7463.40s -> 7464.20s]  Okay, good.
[7464.20s -> 7464.92s]  All right, I'm right back.
[7464.92s -> 7465.88s]  Time to go pee.
[7465.88s -> 7661.37s]  See you guys in like a minute or two.
[7661.37s -> 7662.01s]  Okay, I'm back.
[7663.93s -> 7665.45s]  I just was laughing in the bathroom.
[7665.45s -> 7666.49s]  Just keep thinking of death.
[7667.45s -> 7669.53s]  This is the insanity of that last fight.
[7670.33s -> 7671.83s]  It was all over the place.
[7671.83s -> 7673.19s]  I couldn't even process.
[7673.19s -> 7674.31s]  I just went into full on...
[7674.31s -> 7675.91s]  I went into full-blown panic mode.
[7678.57s -> 7681.11s]  Okay.
[7681.11s -> 7681.91s]  I gotta get out of here.
[7683.75s -> 7689.02s]  So we are rank seven.
[7689.02s -> 7690.06s]  So the next fight is six.
[7691.35s -> 7692.71s]  Very, very cool.
[7696.46s -> 7696.96s]  Okay.
[7705.78s -> 7707.62s]  We have Germaplexis back?
[7707.62s -> 7710.14s]  I don't remember what Germaplexis is.
[7712.46s -> 7722.34s]  Are we gonna get a cut scene here?
[7722.34s -> 7740.04s]  I will shush up.
[7740.04s -> 7742.20s]  Get on the highway, head to Call of Battle.
[7742.84s -> 7746.90s]  Look at my mail.
[7746.90s -> 7755.19s]  Rank six is 35,000 coins.
[7755.19s -> 7756.71s]  Ocean's 51.
[7756.71s -> 7760.36s]  All right, let's head to the...
[7760.36s -> 7761.40s]  This is a new zone, I think, right?
[7762.76s -> 7763.64s]  Call of Battle?
[7771.91s -> 7772.55s]  What are you drinking?
[7773.19s -> 7773.91s]  It's nice coffee.
[7776.78s -> 7777.28s]  Ice?
[7778.06s -> 7778.56s]  Coffee.
[7783.13s -> 7784.17s]  He's still bleeding?
[7784.17s -> 7784.67s]  No.
[7784.89s -> 7788.20s]  You get a cut in your mouth.
[7789.45s -> 7794.68s]  It's weird how it bleeds really badly for five to ten seconds.
[7794.68s -> 7796.28s]  And then it's just immediately sealed.
[7800.34s -> 7800.98s]  It's really weird.
[7804.18s -> 7806.18s]  It's just like, oh my god, I can taste blood.
[7806.18s -> 7806.82s]  I'm bleeding.
[7807.38s -> 7807.86s]  Gone.
[7807.86s -> 7808.50s]  Not anymore.
[7808.50s -> 7809.00s]  Healed.
[7810.36s -> 7811.48s]  Why is the mouth so...
[7812.76s -> 7813.72s]  Mouth heals super fast.
[7813.72s -> 7814.28s]  Yeah, but why?
[7815.08s -> 7819.06s]  What makes the mouth so different versus getting a cut on your finger?
[7821.14s -> 7821.64s]  Iron?
[7824.49s -> 7825.45s]  This is ugly.
[7825.45s -> 7826.09s]  Holy shit.
[7827.13s -> 7830.10s]  I just want to get to my destination quickly.
[7835.22s -> 7835.94s]  Five figures.
[7836.66s -> 7838.52s]  It's because it's saliva.
[7842.20s -> 7843.48s]  Rapid cell replication.
[7846.52s -> 7847.56s]  Damn, this is an ugly zone.
[7847.56s -> 7848.60s]  He's giving me double middle finger?
[7848.60s -> 7849.10s]  What was that?
[7851.51s -> 7852.01s]  Okay.
[7852.01s -> 7852.87s]  Designated matches.
[7853.43s -> 7856.44s]  This place is ugly.
[7857.08s -> 7862.98s]  I feel like I'm looking at this with 3D glasses.
[7870.26s -> 7872.74s]  To a movie or a thing that is not supposed to be 3D.
[7873.38s -> 7884.55s]  It looks like Gears of War 1.
[7885.11s -> 7886.87s]  You know, I've never played any of the Gears of War games.
[7888.22s -> 7890.38s]  That might freak a lot of people out.
[7890.38s -> 7893.10s]  I've never played Gears of War for even 15 seconds.
[7898.94s -> 7900.83s]  All right, let's go.
[7906.84s -> 7907.72s]  Strawberry.
[7907.72s -> 7908.22s]  Right on.
[7918.41s -> 7919.85s]  We played 14 seconds.
[7920.89s -> 7921.39s]  I don't know.
[7921.85s -> 7922.49s]  I don't know what that is.
[7923.77s -> 7924.57s]  The answer is probably no.
[7929.45s -> 7930.57s]  I was looking at a double killer right here.
[7931.13s -> 7931.63s]  Hit them both.
[7932.65s -> 7933.15s]  Yeah!
[7936.94s -> 7937.44s]  Real crazy.
[7938.54s -> 7943.66s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[7943.66s -> 7944.16s]  Ow!
[7944.78s -> 7945.28s]  All right!
[7945.58s -> 7946.08s]  Ow!
[7946.22s -> 7946.72s]  Whatever.
[7947.34s -> 7955.38s]  Oh my god, this is the worst enemy in the game for me.
[7956.42s -> 7957.46s]  It's the worst enemy in the game for me.
[7957.46s -> 7958.82s]  I hate this enemy.
[7958.82s -> 7959.62s]  This sucks.
[7968.01s -> 7969.13s]  What the fuck?
[7969.13s -> 7972.55s]  You do all your moves, take up the whole screen.
[7981.83s -> 7982.33s]  Don't!
[8007.24s -> 8008.12s]  Oh, sorry!
[8013.48s -> 8014.52s]  Where'd you go, where'd you go, where'd you go?
[8017.27s -> 8020.70s]  All right, destroy the eggs.
[8021.90s -> 8022.86s]  Just, I'm gonna beat the eggs up.
[8023.74s -> 8027.16s]  Fuck you.
[8046.46s -> 8049.02s]  What was the Peter Griffin thing?
[8049.58s -> 8051.42s]  Oh, it's me, Peter Griffin.
[8051.42s -> 8052.94s]  I'm playing the Sims.
[8053.74s -> 8055.59s]  I remember that was so embarrassing.
[8073.45s -> 8079.46s]  Fuck out of here.
[8085.06s -> 8089.06s]  I'm gonna push you out of the fucking zone.
[8097.88s -> 8098.92s]  Cute shit out of here.
[8102.54s -> 8104.94s]  Oh, that enemy is the...
[8104.94s -> 8109.66s]  I'm not gonna do the fucking, like, you slow down 0.25x on YouTube joke.
[8109.66s -> 8111.02s]  Again, you heard it before.
[8115.37s -> 8115.87s]  See.
[8126.54s -> 8127.90s]  When has that ever stopped you before?
[8127.90s -> 8128.86s]  Yeah, you're right.
[8128.86s -> 8142.47s]  Somebody said it was literally Gears of War's fault for all the cover shooter bullshit
[8142.47s -> 8143.75s]  that swept the whole industry.
[8148.10s -> 8152.63s]  I never really played it, so.
[8153.27s -> 8157.93s]  But yeah, I do remember pressing right bumper against any surface.
[8158.65s -> 8160.79s]  It was a really big deal for a long time.
[8174.89s -> 8175.39s]  Hey.
[8176.17s -> 8177.53s]  Oh, this stuff over here.
[8177.53s -> 8178.03s]  What is it?
[8178.65s -> 8180.04s]  Oh, it's sushi.
[8189.66s -> 8191.58s]  Chest high walls everywhere.
[8196.22s -> 8196.72s]  That's right.
[8202.30s -> 8207.75s]  Oh, it looks sushi.
[8223.69s -> 8226.14s]  This is your moderator is clearing up chat.
[8234.89s -> 8235.77s]  Thousand bucks for that.
[8236.41s -> 8237.46s]  I'm almost halfway there.
[8237.46s -> 8238.82s]  It's because I made a lot of money last time.
[8239.38s -> 8240.10s]  I didn't spend it.
[8240.98s -> 8241.70s]  What?
[8241.70s -> 8260.98s]  Vlog it up again.
[8260.98s -> 8267.53s]  He says berries because it's a reference to an in-universe magical girl anime
[8267.53s -> 8270.01s]  where all the girls are named after berries.
[8270.01s -> 8277.56s]  Really?
[8277.56s -> 8278.28s]  Refill these.
[8279.00s -> 8281.43s]  I still have not used any of the other ones.
[8287.48s -> 8289.72s]  Raw berry on the shortcake.
[8291.93s -> 8292.89s]  A tank mission?
[8293.61s -> 8295.74s]  All right.
[8295.74s -> 8296.70s]  How do you know what that is?
[8297.26s -> 8298.15s]  How do I get in here?
[8306.63s -> 8307.83s]  Yeah, I know he was...
[8307.83s -> 8310.55s]  I know he says it in the first two games, but I never kind of knew why.
[8311.35s -> 8314.63s]  I had a feeling it was something anime related, but I didn't really know.
[8331.37s -> 8332.01s]  Get ready.
[8333.05s -> 8333.55s]  All right.
[8334.25s -> 8336.17s]  And height.
[8336.17s -> 8336.67s]  Bye.
[8337.77s -> 8339.37s]  And hello.
[8339.37s -> 8339.87s]  Hello.
[8340.33s -> 8340.83s]  And let's go.
[8342.65s -> 8350.68s]  Those things shouldn't be able to explode at regular speed inside my vault.
[8350.68s -> 8360.14s]  I must find that partly infuriating.
[8362.70s -> 8369.85s]  Come on, do a move then.
[8370.49s -> 8375.22s]  Your buddy's not there, you're dead.
[8377.11s -> 8377.61s]  Know what?
[8384.28s -> 8385.08s]  Berry bush, berry bush.
[8385.88s -> 8386.38s]  Go crazy.
[8393.56s -> 8395.00s]  I actually hate these enemies.
[8395.00s -> 8396.12s]  I hate these stupid balls.
[8396.12s -> 8400.78s]  They're annoying.
[8400.78s -> 8401.90s]  One more time.
[8401.90s -> 8403.26s]  I'm just getting started.
[8403.26s -> 8403.76s]  What was that?
[8404.70s -> 8407.34s]  Your next lot effect will always be Mustang mode.
[8409.45s -> 8409.95s]  Really?
[8410.65s -> 8411.21s]  Holy shit.
[8411.21s -> 8411.61s]  This is...
[8411.61s -> 8412.65s]  I'm going to clear this in a second.
[8416.63s -> 8417.35s]  Here we go.
[8425.32s -> 8426.76s]  Give me a thing so I can slide.
[8430.41s -> 8432.81s]  You're so annoying.
[8433.77s -> 8440.98s]  Give me this lot.
[8442.30s -> 8443.18s]  And...
[8443.18s -> 8443.68s]  Go!
[8462.74s -> 8464.74s]  Okay, 88 hit combo.
[8464.74s -> 8465.70s]  That's got to be worth at least an A.
[8466.42s -> 8476.09s]  That was less than a minute.
[8478.68s -> 8480.12s]  I took a lot of damage, but whatever.
[8480.68s -> 8490.57s]  This shit again.
[8491.21s -> 8508.22s]  Where is he?
[8508.78s -> 8514.31s]  Where are you?
[8514.31s -> 8514.81s]  Huh?
[8515.91s -> 8516.63s]  Across the road.
[8517.35s -> 8522.06s]  Can't really see you.
[8523.51s -> 8524.15s]  Is that so?
[8524.71s -> 8528.47s]  But you're becoming able to see me more than before, yes?
[8529.19s -> 8533.34s]  I heard I can ask for anything I want.
[8533.90s -> 8535.21s]  Of course.
[8535.75s -> 8538.25s]  As long as you pay the appropriate price.
[8540.36s -> 8541.16s]  Even murder?
[8542.89s -> 8544.97s]  I don't dabble in such vulgarity.
[8546.14s -> 8550.74s]  However, I am able to perform actions that would result in death.
[8551.46s -> 8554.20s]  Is there really a difference?
[8554.92s -> 8557.11s]  Of course there's a difference.
[8557.11s -> 8559.16s]  Can you kill anyone?
[8560.39s -> 8561.27s]  That's what you wish.
[8562.23s -> 8566.44s]  Problem lies in why exactly you want the person in question dead.
[8568.36s -> 8568.86s]  Why?
[8569.32s -> 8570.44s]  Do you need a reason?
[8572.50s -> 8573.00s]  Yes.
[8573.46s -> 8575.74s]  It's part of the price you must pay.
[8576.62s -> 8577.94s]  Think about that first.
[8578.66s -> 8579.86s]  Money comes after that.
[8580.42s -> 8582.62s]  The reason I want them dead is...
[8583.58s -> 8586.24s]  Hello?
[8586.86s -> 8587.34s]  Hello?
[8587.34s -> 8588.30s]  Are you there?
[8588.30s -> 8589.58s]  The line's dead.
[8589.58s -> 8590.70s]  Oh, never mind.
[8590.70s -> 8591.50s]  I can't hear you.
[8592.30s -> 8593.90s]  You're still not fully prepared.
[8594.62s -> 8596.25s]  I'd speak again later.
[8596.89s -> 8604.46s]  Dabble continued.
[8604.46s -> 8619.10s]  Are you actually gonna finish you, Kriza?
[8619.66s -> 8623.08s]  I sort of laughed at that.
[8623.08s -> 8624.92s]  I'm sorry I just laughed like in your face.
[8625.80s -> 8628.12s]  But I did not expect to answer that question today.
[8628.12s -> 8629.80s]  I should not have laughed at that.
[8632.63s -> 8634.15s]  That's not what my intention was.
[8635.50s -> 8636.94s]  That was a laugh out of nervousness.
[8637.82s -> 8639.91s]  That was really rude, it was.
[8640.55s -> 8641.75s]  Alligators taking over the beach.
[8641.75s -> 8643.35s]  I'd like to test out your fortitude.
[8643.35s -> 8644.87s]  Please go enlist with the Coast Guard.
[8647.74s -> 8648.38s]  Coast Guard?
[8648.38s -> 8649.98s]  Help to quell the mass panic.
[8649.98s -> 8652.94s]  Fight off the alligators riding in on tanks.
[8652.94s -> 8654.89s]  Okay.
[8655.35s -> 8665.12s]  What?
[8665.36s -> 8666.99s]  Targeted and firing.
[8669.82s -> 8671.90s]  It also reminds me of...
[8672.46s -> 8676.04s]  It reminds me of the VR shit that you can play in the mall.
[8676.92s -> 8679.47s]  Like it sucks absolute asshole.
[8681.40s -> 8682.84s]  And it's like not good.
[8682.84s -> 8685.64s]  It feels like it's from VR tech from like 15 years ago.
[8686.91s -> 8688.43s]  Like an Oculus Quest is better.
[8689.55s -> 8690.61s]  Right?
[8691.15s -> 8698.12s]  Am I almost out of time?
[8698.68s -> 8709.16s]  I don't understand.
[8709.16s -> 8709.96s]  How am I gonna have to kill?
[8710.76s -> 8711.80s]  Oh, it's the tutorial.
[8713.36s -> 8713.86s]  Yeah!
[8716.54s -> 8719.34s]  Mall VR is what made me buy an Oculus Quest.
[8720.65s -> 8722.01s]  That's true because it's really like...
[8722.01s -> 8724.33s]  It's a watered down version of what you can actually do in VR.
[8725.29s -> 8728.11s]  So it just maybe gets you interested.
[8728.11s -> 8730.48s]  What's wrong with the quest?
[8730.48s -> 8731.76s]  There's nothing wrong with the quest.
[8731.76s -> 8733.56s]  I'm just saying like it...
[8733.56s -> 8738.76s]  Like the quest is better than the huge gigantic system that's in the mall.
[8738.76s -> 8740.60s]  Some of them might even be on quests now.
[8752.92s -> 8754.36s]  Lots is wrong with the quest.
[8754.36s -> 8755.24s]  I've never used it.
[8755.24s -> 8760.20s]  All right, let's do this now.
[8760.20s -> 8762.04s]  Targeted and firing.
[8762.04s -> 8762.54s]  Focus.
[8763.48s -> 8773.74s]  I gotta have an efficient way to do this.
[8776.64s -> 8777.20s]  I missed?
[8777.20s -> 8777.76s]  What?
[8777.76s -> 8778.26s]  Wow.
[8778.72s -> 8784.60s]  Stay right in the middle.
[8785.16s -> 8798.59s]  That's a hit.
[8798.59s -> 8804.94s]  This is actually scary.
[8805.90s -> 8810.68s]  I've had nightmares where this happens.
[8812.43s -> 8815.63s]  Off in the distance gigantic monsters destroying a city or coming out of the water.
[8815.63s -> 8816.67s]  I've had this nightmare before.
[8817.63s -> 8833.96s]  Oh my goodness.
[8833.96s -> 8834.46s]  Okay.
[8836.94s -> 8837.90s]  You can double kill?
[8838.86s -> 8841.29s]  I don't think that was supposed to happen.
[8842.01s -> 8850.27s]  I feel like I'm playing...
[8851.47s -> 8852.51s]  What's that game?
[8853.69s -> 8854.33s]  With bugs.
[8855.05s -> 8856.65s]  You fight off the gigantic bugs.
[8856.65s -> 8858.17s]  It feels exactly like I'm playing that.
[8858.97s -> 8862.65s]  Why can I not think of that?
[8862.65s -> 8863.37s]  What is what that is?
[8868.67s -> 8869.39s]  Holy shit.
[8869.39s -> 8869.87s]  He's big.
[8870.75s -> 8875.53s]  I got him.
[8875.53s -> 8876.17s]  I killed them all.
[8876.97s -> 8881.92s]  EDF.
[8881.92s -> 8887.28s]  Right, Earth Fan Sports.
[8887.28s -> 8888.08s]  You see that?
[8894.36s -> 8894.84s]  Gold?
[8894.84s -> 8895.96s]  I think that was better than gold.
[8896.60s -> 8910.65s]  It's a reminder for you to give our daily auto update to tell us everything about auto.
[8911.21s -> 8913.96s]  I want level two.
[8917.26s -> 8917.90s]  Auto's great.
[8918.46s -> 8919.90s]  He's doing really well.
[8920.46s -> 8922.11s]  He's nice and happy.
[8925.04s -> 8925.92s]  This is level two.
[8925.92s -> 8926.64s]  What makes this harder?
[8926.64s -> 8927.84s]  Targeted and firing.
[8928.48s -> 8937.92s]  Run once more.
[8937.92s -> 8939.68s]  I imagine this probably does get much harder.
[8940.48s -> 8943.40s]  Easy way to make money though.
[8951.60s -> 8952.56s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[8952.56s -> 8953.28s]  They run fast.
[8953.28s -> 8954.16s]  They run faster.
[8954.72s -> 8956.32s]  Oh god, that's terrifying.
[8958.52s -> 8960.60s]  You gotta start to prioritize enemies now.
[8960.60s -> 8961.32s]  All right, I get it.
[8962.04s -> 8963.60s]  Why is that one red?
[8964.40s -> 8967.71s]  Why are they red?
[8968.43s -> 8976.60s]  Oh, they walk in different directions.
[8976.60s -> 8977.10s]  I get it.
[8977.72s -> 8982.57s]  This is scary.
[8982.57s -> 8983.13s]  I don't like this.
[8994.84s -> 8995.34s]  Whoa.
[8996.12s -> 8996.62s]  Good.
[9003.23s -> 9003.71s]  Missed.
[9003.71s -> 9004.21s]  Come on.
[9005.17s -> 9016.98s]  Oh, shit.
[9022.29s -> 9022.79s]  He'll die.
[9025.30s -> 9026.42s]  Hit him in the head, do more damage.
[9026.42s -> 9027.62s]  And does that not even matter?
[9028.42s -> 9029.22s]  I bet it doesn't matter.
[9035.79s -> 9037.71s]  Whoa, no, I missed.
[9037.71s -> 9038.51s]  Fuck you.
[9038.51s -> 9039.01s]  What?
[9039.39s -> 9040.51s]  Are you serious?
[9040.51s -> 9041.87s]  How did I put it under his armpit?
[9042.91s -> 9043.41s]  Whatever.
[9048.70s -> 9051.58s]  He raised his hand up and I shot under his arm.
[9051.58s -> 9052.71s]  All right, we're good.
[9056.34s -> 9058.26s]  Targeted and firing.
[9058.26s -> 9064.28s]  Yeah, this motherfucker raised up his armpit.
[9064.92s -> 9068.12s]  Well, now I know what happens.
[9068.12s -> 9078.31s]  So it's not based on when they decide to run.
[9078.31s -> 9080.71s]  It's who comes up first is who runs first.
[9081.27s -> 9082.39s]  They had that messed up.
[9083.35s -> 9085.75s]  I was assuming the person that was in front was going to run fast.
[9087.35s -> 9088.15s]  They go in order.
[9112.05s -> 9121.40s]  Okay, here comes a big guy in second here.
[9122.44s -> 9127.44s]  Big guy coming up.
[9128.16s -> 9133.86s]  Didn't keep walking.
[9148.10s -> 9149.78s]  Okay, let's go.
[9149.78s -> 9155.00s]  What does he worth?
[9155.00s -> 9155.48s]  How many points?
[9156.04s -> 9160.72s]  500.
[9160.72s -> 9168.52s]  That's where I died.
[9169.32s -> 9181.19s]  I got it.
[9186.56s -> 9187.44s]  Really does look like a dream.
[9187.44s -> 9188.64s]  Yeah, it feels like a dream.
[9188.64s -> 9189.28s]  It's creepy.
[9192.76s -> 9195.16s]  Somebody said that level three is really the actually hard one.
[9195.88s -> 9198.90s]  Find out.
[9198.90s -> 9200.40s]  It'd be available, right?
[9200.40s -> 9204.86s]  Level three?
[9207.62s -> 9208.58s]  I guess not yet.
[9209.60s -> 9210.88s]  Later, okay, cool.
[9210.88s -> 9216.26s]  Damn it.
[9216.26s -> 9217.86s]  All right, well, there's a fight right here.
[9217.86s -> 9227.12s]  Come on, I don't want to walk that way.
[9227.12s -> 9238.84s]  Okay, I'll just walk fine right here.
[9239.48s -> 9249.09s]  Do I still play VR games?
[9249.97s -> 9256.44s]  Yeah, I've taken a break from VR just because it really, really, really fucked me up last time.
[9262.10s -> 9264.82s]  Break dancing and getting thrown through a window at the dollhouse
[9265.54s -> 9269.94s]  for some reason was not even remotely as bad as streaming VR for a few days.
[9270.74s -> 9271.30s]  I don't know.
[9271.30s -> 9272.18s]  It just kills me now.
[9274.45s -> 9281.83s]  Something about the headset being on and how hot it gets in there and the movement.
[9282.79s -> 9284.31s]  Standing and all the motions.
[9288.56s -> 9289.12s]  There's a lot.
[9289.12s -> 9289.92s]  It was just horrible.
[9290.48s -> 9302.52s]  This feels like I'm playing Resident Evil 1 Silent Hill or something.
[9303.08s -> 9313.96s]  I really would like to get out of this area.
[9313.96s -> 9314.95s]  It hurts.
[9328.10s -> 9330.10s]  Game's resolution keeps getting worse.
[9330.10s -> 9334.80s]  And we keep losing a couple hundred pixels in either direction.
[9338.56s -> 9340.16s]  Let's get this over with.
[9341.54s -> 9343.30s]  Oh, this is going to be, this is going to suck.
[9343.30s -> 9353.72s]  Keep him in here.
[9356.76s -> 9361.06s]  Pick him up.
[9363.94s -> 9369.59s]  Dodged it.
[9369.59s -> 9370.63s]  All right, this is really clean.
[9371.59s -> 9372.23s]  I got a kill here.
[9372.23s -> 9374.77s]  This is really clean.
[9374.77s -> 9377.97s]  And give me Mustang right now and let's go for it.
[9379.40s -> 9380.36s]  Bro crazy.
[9380.36s -> 9381.40s]  I can't even pick these guys up.
[9382.36s -> 9383.32s]  I can't even touch these guys.
[9386.42s -> 9395.91s]  Yeah, no, what's the, they have like these stupid ass shields.
[9411.97s -> 9413.17s]  They start hitting people.
[9419.64s -> 9420.68s]  You're fucking with my flow.
[9420.68s -> 9420.92s]  Honest to God.
[9447.52s -> 9448.88s]  Well, why don't you die already?
[9460.37s -> 9460.85s]  Come on.
[9463.52s -> 9474.68s]  Oh, we got a raid.
[9475.48s -> 9475.96s]  Shit, hold on.
[9482.00s -> 9482.80s]  Good, good, good, good.
[9482.80s -> 9483.92s]  This is exactly what I want to have happen.
[9484.64s -> 9487.12s]  I just saved the whole run.
[9487.92s -> 9495.11s]  Thank God.
[9495.11s -> 9496.96s]  Okay, we got a raid.
[9496.96s -> 9497.46s]  We're raiding.
[9501.03s -> 9501.75s]  Jimmy here.
[9502.47s -> 9504.92s]  Jimmy here with a, that's a, that's a big raid.
[9504.92s -> 9506.60s]  We've got like 1500 people just showed up.
[9507.24s -> 9508.88s]  Welcome everybody.
[9508.88s -> 9509.36s]  How you doing?
[9509.92s -> 9511.40s]  Thank you, Jimmy.
[9511.40s -> 9512.04s]  Thanks for the raid.
[9512.84s -> 9514.53s]  Raid song.
[9515.17s -> 9520.58s]  Oh, I haven't done raid songs since like 2019.
[9521.22s -> 9524.00s]  Oh, no raid songs.
[9525.91s -> 9526.55s]  Welcome.
[9526.55s -> 9527.59s]  Playing Normal Heroes 3.
[9528.47s -> 9529.67s]  I love it so far.
[9529.67s -> 9531.43s]  We're about, I'd say probably halfway through the game.
[9531.43s -> 9534.39s]  So if you're gonna play it yourself, just, you know, be aware.
[9534.39s -> 9535.75s]  You might see things you don't want to see.
[9536.39s -> 9539.62s]  We're about six to seven hours into the total game play.
[9540.42s -> 9543.00s]  Raid song, fine.
[9543.64s -> 9545.09s]  Welcome to the stream.
[9545.09s -> 9545.89s]  I think you're the best.
[9546.45s -> 9547.86s]  Welcome to the stream.
[9547.94s -> 9548.82s]  Now this is a test.
[9549.62s -> 9550.82s]  Welcome to the stream.
[9550.82s -> 9551.94s]  Will the raiders stay?
[9552.58s -> 9553.76s]  Welcome to the stream.
[9555.25s -> 9558.45s]  Hey, after I scream this shit, let's see how many you leave.
[9559.17s -> 9569.96s]  I was just in there, come on.
[9569.96s -> 9572.28s]  Do I have enough money?
[9574.20s -> 9575.32s]  35, right?
[9575.32s -> 9578.32s]  Yeah, I don't have enough.
[9578.32s -> 9580.16s]  Spoken word is not a song.
[9581.36s -> 9588.02s]  Let's rubble out of here.
[9588.58s -> 9593.20s]  You know what this actually feels like?
[9593.20s -> 9596.32s]  And it's weird because this was a game that was on that console.
[9596.32s -> 9599.60s]  This feels like a shitload of original Wii games.
[9601.06s -> 9602.02s]  Damn, were they ugly.
[9602.58s -> 9603.78s]  They were so ugly.
[9605.12s -> 9607.76s]  Some of them were so ugly that it was almost impossible to play them.
[9608.56s -> 9619.84s]  I remember having a Wii and other people having a 360.
[9619.84s -> 9624.93s]  And any time a game that had decent, in quotes, graphics on the Wii came out,
[9624.93s -> 9627.09s]  it was always a big deal you tried to make to your friends.
[9627.09s -> 9628.61s]  Like, yeah, look, it looks pretty good.
[9630.13s -> 9633.17s]  And deep down, you know that this is supposed to be the good graphics.
[9633.73s -> 9634.93s]  And everybody's judging you.
[9637.54s -> 9638.66s]  And you're even judging you.
[9639.22s -> 9649.86s]  I remember selecting.
[9650.42s -> 9654.10s]  You guys remember switching cables on the Wii?
[9654.98s -> 9657.54s]  And it was like an Omega Chad moment
[9658.10s -> 9660.82s]  because you switched to component cables and could do 480p.
[9664.90s -> 9665.94s]  Here we go.
[9665.94s -> 9666.66s]  720.
[9668.76s -> 9670.04s]  I get progressive scan now.
[9672.69s -> 9680.88s]  Yeah, I remember the old Mega Chad moment of just plugging in the blue cable.
[9681.76s -> 9683.76s]  Like, yo, bro, I got the blue fucking cable.
[9684.87s -> 9686.71s]  Oh, you got the Chad cables.
[9686.71s -> 9687.21s]  Yep.
[9687.75s -> 9688.82s]  Of course I did.
[9689.54s -> 9690.74s]  Death melt shower.
[9691.54s -> 9701.97s]  Spin death.
[9701.97s -> 9703.01s]  Baste 480i.
[9703.01s -> 9703.51s]  What's that?
[9704.05s -> 9705.17s]  Oh, armor standing by.
[9705.73s -> 9706.37s]  Oh, let's go.
[9709.96s -> 9711.32s]  We have not seen this in-game yet.
[9715.03s -> 9716.39s]  Holy shit, I just killed everybody.
[9716.95s -> 9727.80s]  480p has a nostalgic, comfy amount of crust.
[9728.44s -> 9729.64s]  I actually liked 480p.
[9730.44s -> 9738.32s]  I remember switching from 480i to 480p for the first time.
[9739.12s -> 9740.79s]  That's a double S.
[9741.67s -> 9743.75s]  When I switch from 480i to like 480p,
[9744.71s -> 9747.88s]  you guys remember the Wii used to have a little bit of input lag?
[9749.32s -> 9752.52s]  And when you switched, you had that kind of sloppy,
[9752.52s -> 9755.64s]  maybe 50 millisecond, 100 millisecond response delay.
[9755.64s -> 9761.32s]  And when you select 480p, it was almost one-to-one.
[9762.12s -> 9766.12s]  It was literally the 480i to 480p Nintendo Wii
[9766.12s -> 9769.75s]  was like having a 120 hertz monitor the first time.
[9769.75s -> 9774.10s]  It was world-changing.
[9774.66s -> 9781.01s]  Yeah, it was like going from 30 to 60 FPS.
[9784.92s -> 9785.56s]  All right, I got enough.
[9789.89s -> 9792.71s]  There was an ATM, actually pretty close to one.
[9795.67s -> 9797.75s]  Hold on, there's a lot of question marks here.
[9807.30s -> 9809.70s]  GameCube component cables go for like $400.
[9811.25s -> 9815.40s]  They make adapters for the Wii that are HDMI,
[9815.40s -> 9818.04s]  and it forces the game, if you put a GameCube game in,
[9818.04s -> 9821.88s]  it forces progressive mode, which is really cool, actually.
[9821.88s -> 9823.40s]  A lot of times you've seen me play GameCube
[9823.40s -> 9826.68s]  or with the HDMI adapter in a Wii.
[9843.38s -> 9844.34s]  Fake pirated game?
[9849.89s -> 9852.61s]  A fake pirated game is just you bought the game, dude.
[9853.33s -> 9865.00s]  How do you fake a pirated game?
[9878.60s -> 9880.52s]  VR is going to get scary technology in the future.
[9881.75s -> 9885.01s]  Yeah, it is already kind of scary now.
[9885.01s -> 9895.54s]  All right, what else is over here?
[9895.54s -> 9896.82s]  There's tons of stuff.
[9896.82s -> 9899.36s]  There's a trash cleanup.
[9899.36s -> 9899.84s]  I'll do that.
[9900.48s -> 9903.99s]  Here is one of these.
[9903.99s -> 9905.27s]  I couldn't even see that on the ground.
[9906.23s -> 9920.15s]  Okay, oh, acquire a total of over 10,000 Utopia coins.
[9920.23s -> 9920.79s]  I have that.
[9921.43s -> 9922.07s]  I want that.
[9922.07s -> 9923.03s]  I like that shirt a lot.
[9923.59s -> 9932.64s]  How am I doing on sushi?
[9932.64s -> 9933.60s]  I'm about to fight the boss.
[9934.32s -> 9945.06s]  It's now more of a fun thing than the scary thing.
[9945.06s -> 9946.82s]  It's really easy to tell the difference.
[9946.82s -> 9947.86s]  Yeah, once they make...
[9947.86s -> 9948.42s]  And I don't know.
[9948.42s -> 9948.90s]  Here's the thing.
[9949.94s -> 9951.54s]  I don't think there's ever going to be a point
[9951.54s -> 9952.90s]  where we can tell the difference,
[9953.62s -> 9954.98s]  at least in our lifetimes.
[9956.76s -> 9959.00s]  But we can't tell the difference is what I mean.
[9961.64s -> 9965.00s]  This is like kind of a real life VR type shit.
[9965.00s -> 9966.36s]  You know how many pixels it would take
[9966.36s -> 9970.61s]  just to get somebody's realistic face photo realistic?
[9971.09s -> 9972.05s]  Show up on your screen.
[9975.30s -> 9977.86s]  It would take an incredible amount of computer power.
[9977.86s -> 9980.64s]  So you and I are not going to see that.
[9982.12s -> 9984.60s]  Maybe a few, I don't know,
[9984.60s -> 9986.36s]  a few generations ahead of us.
[9986.36s -> 9991.20s]  Depends on how quantum computing goes.
[9991.20s -> 9992.16s]  You and I aren't going to see it.
[9992.72s -> 9993.92s]  Maybe somebody else will.
[9996.61s -> 9998.53s]  And I'll tell you, I'm kind of happy I won't.
[10000.77s -> 10003.46s]  Because it's going to be really weird.
[10003.46s -> 10005.30s]  That real life is going to be...
[10006.18s -> 10008.26s]  It's going to be so uncanny valley.
[10013.25s -> 10014.61s]  I like being able to tell the difference.
[10014.61s -> 10018.18s]  Even if it's really good looking,
[10018.18s -> 10019.86s]  being able to actually tell the difference
[10020.98s -> 10023.30s]  lets us exist in both spaces.
[10023.94s -> 10027.81s]  Because once you can't separate fiction from reality,
[10028.37s -> 10030.93s]  what the fuck even is reality anymore?
[10031.81s -> 10032.85s]  I don't like that.
[10032.85s -> 10039.80s]  I like to be able to separate them.
[10039.80s -> 10041.16s]  I don't want it to get to that point
[10041.16s -> 10042.44s]  where I can't tell the difference.
[10044.40s -> 10052.42s]  Terrifies me.
[10052.42s -> 10054.34s]  Everything's just a lucid dream at that point?
[10054.34s -> 10054.98s]  Yeah.
[10054.98s -> 10055.62s]  Ah, yeah.
[10055.62s -> 10056.82s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[10056.82s -> 10057.30s]  No thanks.
[10057.86s -> 10059.97s]  Shut up and stream, gamer boy.
[10060.69s -> 10063.03s]  Shut up and stream, gamer boy.
[10063.03s -> 10064.71s]  And now that's what happens when I'm not even looking.
[10070.20s -> 10070.76s]  Where is it?
[10071.89s -> 10074.05s]  Head to the motel parking lot.
[10074.05s -> 10074.45s]  Oh, okay.
[10074.45s -> 10077.48s]  Well, we can just fast travel.
[10077.48s -> 10079.24s]  Shut up and stream, gamer boy.
[10095.73s -> 10096.85s]  I imagine a hacker
[10097.41s -> 10100.96s]  sends you a video of your mother freaking out
[10100.96s -> 10102.56s]  and crying and screaming and shit.
[10103.88s -> 10105.40s]  And it's not even real.
[10105.40s -> 10106.60s]  But technology has gotten to the point
[10106.60s -> 10108.04s]  where you can fake everything.
[10108.04s -> 10109.40s]  And it's not even the deep fakes.
[10111.65s -> 10112.37s]  Oh, it's a deep fake.
[10112.37s -> 10112.69s]  No, no, no.
[10112.69s -> 10114.21s]  It's like it's just you can't even tell the difference
[10114.21s -> 10115.65s]  between fucking fact and fiction.
[10116.53s -> 10125.43s]  MonkaW.
[10125.43s -> 10125.67s]  Yeah.
[10127.38s -> 10129.62s]  We MonkaW at deep fakes right now.
[10139.11s -> 10140.79s]  The one thing that I would be happy with
[10140.79s -> 10141.91s]  with like the kind of technology
[10141.91s -> 10143.03s]  of not being able to tell the difference
[10143.59s -> 10145.46s]  is like somebody kind of just mentioned it a little bit.
[10145.46s -> 10147.14s]  I can imagine somebody just had made a realistic
[10147.14s -> 10149.54s]  like in real life you're watching reality
[10149.54s -> 10152.68s]  of like Richard Nixon like fighting
[10153.75s -> 10155.03s]  like fucking I don't know
[10155.03s -> 10157.19s]  like the Quaker Oats guy in like a wrestling ring.
[10157.19s -> 10158.47s]  Like that's kind of funny, right?
[10162.64s -> 10164.24s]  And if you couldn't even tell the difference
[10164.24s -> 10166.08s]  it's just like actual video footage.
[10166.08s -> 10169.28s]  I already did this.
[10169.28s -> 10178.05s]  It was a very strange example.
[10180.85s -> 10183.33s]  Or like a realistic real life of
[10183.33s -> 10184.61s]  let's just use Richard Nixon again.
[10185.41s -> 10187.88s]  Like they did make him like a pop star.
[10188.52s -> 10190.28s]  And he has like singles and shit.
[10190.28s -> 10191.16s]  It could be anybody.
[10191.16s -> 10192.52s]  They could like break like Abraham Lincoln
[10192.52s -> 10194.92s]  could have like a songs in like movies
[10194.92s -> 10195.64s]  and it would just be him.
[10198.71s -> 10199.19s]  Like we...
[10199.19s -> 10199.75s]  Okay, here we go.
[10199.75s -> 10200.95s]  I'm gonna get really existential here.
[10200.95s -> 10201.35s]  Are you ready?
[10204.21s -> 10205.89s]  This is really existential scary shit.
[10205.89s -> 10206.61s]  You ready for this?
[10206.61s -> 10207.49s]  I don't think you guys ready for this.
[10207.65s -> 10208.93s]  I don't know if it's too early for this.
[10211.36s -> 10215.12s]  If we have a world where we can just...
[10215.12s -> 10218.00s]  It's so realistic that you can't tell the difference.
[10218.00s -> 10219.28s]  People don't die.
[10223.25s -> 10225.35s]  Huh? Yeah?
[10228.37s -> 10230.96s]  People will always be able to exist.
[10230.96s -> 10232.00s]  Terrifying.
[10232.00s -> 10233.43s]  Look at that.
[10234.71s -> 10236.55s]  Smoke on that one for a little while.
[10242.56s -> 10244.80s]  Black Mirror already did this five years ago.
[10244.80s -> 10248.16s]  I don't care if Family Guy did a reference to that.
[10248.16s -> 10249.04s]  I don't care.
[10249.04s -> 10250.88s]  You and I are having a conversation right now.
[10251.68s -> 10252.00s]  All right.
[10252.00s -> 10252.48s]  Let me get...
[10252.48s -> 10253.52s]  Okay, listen to this.
[10253.52s -> 10256.80s]  If you and I are having a conversation in a living room
[10256.80s -> 10258.16s]  where I'm sitting on a couch,
[10258.16s -> 10259.84s]  you're sitting on the chair across from me
[10259.84s -> 10261.04s]  and I'm like, man, you know,
[10261.04s -> 10262.48s]  just talking like existential stuff.
[10263.12s -> 10264.16s]  Like can you imagine...
[10264.16s -> 10264.96s]  Like I got something for you.
[10264.96s -> 10265.84s]  Imagine how fucked up it is
[10265.84s -> 10267.36s]  like when you can't tell the difference
[10267.36s -> 10268.48s]  between like fact and fiction.
[10268.48s -> 10270.00s]  It's gonna be so fucking crazy.
[10270.00s -> 10270.96s]  And you just leaned in and said,
[10270.96s -> 10272.40s]  they did a Black Mirror episode about that.
[10272.40s -> 10273.20s]  Stop talking to me.
[10274.40s -> 10275.04s]  All right.
[10275.04s -> 10277.25s]  Hey dude, I saw a funny thing today.
[10277.25s -> 10279.09s]  Dude, you know Captain Crunch?
[10279.09s -> 10281.97s]  Dude, it like cuts the roof of my mouth all the time.
[10281.97s -> 10283.09s]  Like what the fuck?
[10283.09s -> 10285.97s]  Family Guy did that joke already three years ago.
[10285.97s -> 10287.40s]  Shut up.
[10287.40s -> 10287.64s]  I...
[10287.64s -> 10287.96s]  Okay.
[10295.36s -> 10296.48s]  You're so stoned.
[10300.12s -> 10301.40s]  Chat cancelled, isn't it?
[10302.44s -> 10303.75s]  All right.
[10303.75s -> 10304.87s]  I'll get back to the game.
[10304.87s -> 10305.83s]  Let me get back to the game.
[10305.83s -> 10307.35s]  We got like a bunch of new people here.
[10307.35s -> 10308.39s]  Come on, Gwen.
[10308.39s -> 10313.92s]  Don't cross over just yet.
[10313.92s -> 10315.44s]  You must not chase after the swan
[10315.44s -> 10317.84s]  on the other side of the lake when the rain falls.
[10317.84s -> 10320.08s]  That little girl is dangerous.
[10320.08s -> 10321.60s]  You'll get sucked down to the deepest depths
[10321.60s -> 10322.80s]  of your subconscious.
[10322.80s -> 10324.37s]  The beautiful landscape
[10324.37s -> 10326.61s]  and the melancholic melody are just lures.
[10327.49s -> 10327.97s]  Stay away.
[10327.97s -> 10329.41s]  I can hear Birkin's voice.
[10329.89s -> 10331.65s]  Your daddy doesn't want to see you just yet.
[10331.65s -> 10331.97s]  What am I?
[10331.97s -> 10332.85s]  What's this fucking weird?
[10332.85s -> 10333.73s]  What am I doing?
[10333.73s -> 10342.63s]  Dude, imagine like...
[10345.67s -> 10346.63s]  Dude, imagine like the world...
[10346.63s -> 10348.63s]  Like when technology gets so crazy.
[10348.63s -> 10349.99s]  You know, it's me and you're just hanging out talking.
[10350.79s -> 10354.12s]  Shut up, Simpsons Watcher.
[10354.76s -> 10358.60s]  Did I save the game?
[10359.32s -> 10360.20s]  Wait, I gotta upgrade.
[10360.84s -> 10383.89s]  Pass the joint already.
[10383.89s -> 10384.69s]  I don't have any toys.
[10384.69s -> 10386.05s]  Where do I get the toys?
[10386.05s -> 10387.19s]  I have no toys.
[10387.19s -> 10387.75s]  This sucks.
[10403.06s -> 10411.11s]  Wayne's World already did that.
[10411.11s -> 10412.55s]  And I know the song they did too.
[10414.18s -> 10415.38s]  Ballroom Blitz.
[10415.38s -> 10415.94s]  Blitz.
[10415.94s -> 10416.42s]  Blitz.
[10416.42s -> 10417.62s]  Ballroom Blitz.
[10417.62s -> 10418.10s]  Blitz.
[10418.10s -> 10418.58s]  Blitz.
[10419.30s -> 10420.50s]  And the girl in the corner.
[10420.50s -> 10423.38s]  Everybody want a ballroom blitz.
[10423.38s -> 10424.66s]  And the girl in the corner.
[10424.66s -> 10425.78s]  Everybody want a ballroom blitz.
[10425.78s -> 10426.90s]  Yeah, I've seen that movie.
[10426.90s -> 10427.78s]  I've seen that scene.
[10428.42s -> 10430.66s]  That doesn't mean we can't have a conversation about it.
[10430.66s -> 10440.36s]  All right, I have 6300.
[10440.36s -> 10442.18s]  I'm gonna just...
[10442.18s -> 10443.30s]  Yeah, I gotta do this.
[10444.02s -> 10446.29s]  I gotta go down this path
[10446.29s -> 10447.57s]  because I want the double dodge.
[10448.69s -> 10454.79s]  So hold X to charge your beam katana.
[10454.79s -> 10456.23s]  Leaves you so vulnerable though.
[10456.23s -> 10456.87s]  Takes too long.
[10460.36s -> 10461.24s]  I'm gonna dump it into this
[10462.04s -> 10464.20s]  because I want to be able to get that immediately after this.
[10464.76s -> 10469.76s]  Death skill level one.
[10470.32s -> 10473.38s]  Why is it death skill level one?
[10475.83s -> 10476.71s]  Oh, shit.
[10478.28s -> 10479.48s]  Right, that's what this is.
[10480.28s -> 10481.24s]  All right, I'll do that again.
[10481.96s -> 10482.85s]  Do it after this.
[10485.43s -> 10491.65s]  Okay, all right.
[10491.65s -> 10492.21s]  I think I'm good.
[10492.77s -> 10500.64s]  Any chance of a face cam?
[10500.64s -> 10501.76s]  Not with this nudity.
[10501.76s -> 10509.48s]  Would you ever like to be immortal?
[10509.48s -> 10511.44s]  No.
[10511.44s -> 10513.84s]  Although I can't lie, I don't ever want to be immortal.
[10513.84s -> 10516.24s]  But I think I would want to live a thousand years.
[10516.96s -> 10518.08s]  I think that's enough.
[10518.08s -> 10520.42s]  Maybe less.
[10520.42s -> 10521.54s]  Maybe 500.
[10521.54s -> 10527.41s]  Or you know what?
[10527.41s -> 10528.05s]  Like, okay.
[10528.61s -> 10531.27s]  Maybe like 150.
[10531.83s -> 10535.09s]  And you don't really start to actually get old
[10535.09s -> 10537.49s]  until 130, 140.
[10538.13s -> 10539.99s]  Thousand might be too long.
[10539.99s -> 10545.32s]  What about immortal with the chance of ending it on your own
[10545.32s -> 10545.96s]  when you want to?
[10545.96s -> 10546.68s]  No, I don't like that.
[10546.68s -> 10547.32s]  And I'll tell you why.
[10547.88s -> 10550.92s]  So if you have the choice to just turn it off,
[10551.56s -> 10552.68s]  when are you gonna turn it off?
[10553.32s -> 10556.74s]  Just one day you flip a switch?
[10556.74s -> 10557.38s]  Okay, that's it.
[10557.78s -> 10560.82s]  No, I don't think anyone would actually be able to do that.
[10561.30s -> 10565.99s]  It would be a really tough thing to do.
[10566.55s -> 10573.30s]  Because I imagine like the two or three lifetimes
[10573.30s -> 10574.26s]  of different people.
[10574.90s -> 10575.99s]  It's a lot.
[10575.99s -> 10577.91s]  Yeah, it's a lot of like responsibility
[10577.91s -> 10580.63s]  to be able to be like, okay, I can turn the switch off.
[10581.27s -> 10584.45s]  Like, I imagine like me right now,
[10585.33s -> 10586.85s]  it's been like 600 years.
[10587.49s -> 10588.53s]  I don't know.
[10588.53s -> 10589.97s]  Part of me would just sit there and kind of be like,
[10590.53s -> 10594.02s]  you know, I wonder if Bitcoin is going to be like 60 million dollars.
[10594.02s -> 10595.30s]  Like, I got to stay alive, right?
[10595.86s -> 10599.62s]  What if, okay, hold on.
[10599.62s -> 10600.18s]  I got to stay alive.
[10600.18s -> 10604.34s]  What if the US dollar is worth like 600 million US dollars in one dollar?
[10604.34s -> 10605.22s]  Like, I kind of need to know.
[10605.78s -> 10609.89s]  Are aliens going to show up?
[10611.80s -> 10614.12s]  Well, I want to, okay, what if I turn it off
[10614.12s -> 10616.44s]  and then like a week later, the aliens show up?
[10616.44s -> 10617.16s]  I kind of want to see it.
[10617.80s -> 10623.62s]  What do cars look like?
[10626.28s -> 10626.92s]  Are there cars?
[10627.64s -> 10628.60s]  What happens to roads?
[10629.16s -> 10633.30s]  I feel like I would have a list of like end game of things
[10633.30s -> 10636.26s]  that I thought were like, okay, like economic stuff.
[10636.26s -> 10637.78s]  What does the stock market look like?
[10637.78s -> 10639.86s]  What does like cryptocurrency look like?
[10639.86s -> 10641.22s]  What does the world look like?
[10641.22s -> 10642.66s]  What do world powers look like?
[10642.66s -> 10644.34s]  I think I'd have a checklist of things
[10644.34s -> 10652.85s]  that I would want to see how they played out.
[10652.85s -> 10654.61s]  What happens in the Marvel universe?
[10657.41s -> 10661.17s]  Yeah, what happens in phase 35 of the MCU?
[10661.17s -> 10661.73s]  I need to know.
[10668.88s -> 10669.44s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[10669.44s -> 10671.68s]  I kind of would want to like see how the world plays out
[10671.68s -> 10673.36s]  in a lot of very kind of maybe specific ways.
[10674.39s -> 10677.19s]  But it would, how, when would I turn it off though?
[10677.19s -> 10681.28s]  I don't know.
[10681.28s -> 10682.88s]  What if I, okay, what if I fulfilled those things?
[10682.88s -> 10687.04s]  What if like, okay, by the way, the stock market went to zero
[10687.76s -> 10691.84s]  and, uh, fucking silk has replaced the U.S. economy.
[10692.56s -> 10693.76s]  Oh, all right, cool.
[10693.76s -> 10694.24s]  Now what?
[10694.24s -> 10695.04s]  Like, when does it end?
[10695.60s -> 10698.80s]  The number six ranked assassin is Velvet Chair Girl.
[10699.52s -> 10703.12s]  She is the intergalactic musical chairs champion.
[10703.12s -> 10706.24s]  She works with Oma who has a huge gastro gun.
[10707.44s -> 10708.96s]  She turns it off before the sun explodes.
[10710.96s -> 10713.76s]  Welcome to the Garden of Insanity.
[10713.76s -> 10715.92s]  So what, you're saying that like, wait, okay, well,
[10716.00s -> 10719.84s]  I'm looking at the sun and it's been like another four or five thousand years
[10719.84s -> 10721.76s]  and I see it start to shake a little.
[10722.64s -> 10726.00s]  The sun's shaking a little bit and turning bright orange.
[10726.72s -> 10729.49s]  And then I look up and I'm just like, yep, switch off.
[10729.49s -> 10730.45s]  God, off, off, off.
[10731.17s -> 10732.66s]  Is that what you're saying?
[10733.38s -> 10737.27s]  Or do you wait till you see the, when do you do it?
[10740.60s -> 10741.56s]  Sun is shaking.
[10741.56s -> 10745.64s]  It's making sounds and then it just implodes and starts waving towards us.
[10746.44s -> 10747.24s]  And then switch off.
[10749.89s -> 10757.99s]  There's a billion years left on the planet before that happens.
[10757.99s -> 10759.51s]  I don't want to live a billion years.
[10759.51s -> 10759.99s]  I'm sorry.
[10760.71s -> 10765.27s]  I don't have any money so I can't buy anything anyways.
[10765.83s -> 10767.65s]  Although I could do one of the little ones, yeah.
[10770.18s -> 10771.46s]  Oh, I actually can't.
[10771.46s -> 10772.18s]  I can't afford anything.
[10775.97s -> 10778.29s]  Just before it turns into a red giant.
[10788.40s -> 10798.34s]  Oh, living forever would be mad boring at some point.
[10798.34s -> 10800.10s]  Like at some point you would run out of things to do.
[10800.10s -> 10808.32s]  Yeah, it would be kind of boring after a while.
[10809.92s -> 10814.24s]  Honestly, after the first like, I think 100 years, I think it'd be like, well,
[10814.24s -> 10819.67s]  fuck, there's only so many times I can go to Disney World before I've,
[10819.67s -> 10822.39s]  I've shaken hands with Mickey Mouse like 400 times already.
[10822.95s -> 10824.07s]  How many more times can I do that?
[10824.79s -> 10828.64s]  I've traveled the world a hundred times over.
[10828.64s -> 10829.84s]  What else do I do?
[10829.84s -> 10833.12s]  Should I try to, like, okay, here's a question for you guys though.
[10833.12s -> 10836.16s]  If I'm a mortal, does that count for other planets?
[10836.16s -> 10837.84s]  Like, do I breathe oxygen still?
[10838.40s -> 10842.31s]  Like, could they, could you just shoot me in a rocket into space
[10842.31s -> 10844.15s]  and could I like try to find another planet or something?
[10844.87s -> 10847.99s]  Do I need to, do I have to breathe oxygen?
[10848.71s -> 10851.81s]  Or could I actually, could you just shoot me in a rocket into a random planet in space?
[10852.45s -> 10855.57s]  And just give me a deck of cards and I'll just fucking,
[10855.57s -> 10857.73s]  I'll play solitaire for like a thousand years.
[10857.73s -> 10862.90s]  Immortal does not mean invincible, right?
[10863.54s -> 10867.51s]  Your mind would break?
[10868.15s -> 10875.46s]  But what if I said to make, okay, so I'm not invincible.
[10875.46s -> 10876.74s]  So I'm just a person though.
[10876.74s -> 10880.66s]  Would I be a person or could I withstand a rocket going like 500 times faster?
[10884.66s -> 10885.38s]  I'm just a person.
[10886.02s -> 10891.88s]  All right.
[10891.88s -> 10894.84s]  Well, look, we'll, we'll wrap back to this later.
[10895.40s -> 10897.32s]  We have a cut scene and a boss.
[10897.32s -> 10910.08s]  Face.
[10910.08s -> 10910.80s]  Yeah.
[10910.80s -> 10913.75s]  It's a bit too over the top.
[10913.75s -> 10916.15s]  Looks like public fun spent badly.
[10916.15s -> 10918.15s]  It's a form of culture, you know.
[10918.15s -> 10919.27s]  I don't think so.
[10919.27s -> 10920.63s]  I mean, what even is?
[10920.63s -> 10922.31s]  I don't want to talk about this all night.
[10922.87s -> 10923.11s]  Yeah.
[10923.11s -> 10925.59s]  Well, first let's take out this next dickhead.
[10925.59s -> 10926.31s]  Then we'll talk.
[10926.87s -> 10928.77s]  I love that term.
[10929.33s -> 10930.37s]  I love dickhead.
[10930.93s -> 10937.01s]  Today's main event, the galactic title match is about to begin.
[10937.01s -> 10938.05s]  What is going on?
[10938.05s -> 10940.85s]  Please welcome the galactic champion.
[10944.61s -> 10949.00s]  I feel like I'm watching an episode of Xavier renegade angel.
[10949.80s -> 10954.98s]  Well, it's this looks like Las Vegas.
[10956.02s -> 10958.26s]  You know, I actually kind of like this stuff.
[10962.05s -> 10962.61s]  Please.
[10962.61s -> 10963.57s]  I've got to do it.
[10963.57s -> 10968.13s]  And I stop being immortal.
[10968.13s -> 10970.85s]  I could never be immortal or could I?
[10970.85s -> 10971.65s]  That's a question.
[10978.58s -> 10979.78s]  What musical chairs?
[10980.34s -> 10987.09s]  When the music stops bolt straight for the closest chair,
[10987.09s -> 10991.24s]  hit the buttons displayed on the screen in time with the metronome.
[10991.24s -> 10991.96s]  Oh no.
[10992.68s -> 10995.28s]  I don't have the this memorized this controller.
[10996.84s -> 10997.08s]  What?
[11009.28s -> 11014.29s]  Oh, God.
[11020.77s -> 11023.84s]  I said to pretend I'm playing Super Mario RPG.
[11023.84s -> 11026.40s]  And I have it memorized if I think I'm playing Mario RPG.
[11027.12s -> 11028.40s]  I swear to God, that's how I'm doing this.
[11054.74s -> 11055.72s]  What is it?
[11055.72s -> 11056.92s]  When do I stop doing this?
[11063.76s -> 11064.64s]  How do I stop?
[11066.76s -> 11067.32s]  I got a chair.
[11070.88s -> 11071.20s]  Nice.
[11071.20s -> 11081.33s]  This is just Mario Party with a few extra steps, I think.
[11081.97s -> 11083.32s]  Oh, no.
[11083.32s -> 11083.88s]  Here we go.
[11084.52s -> 11092.21s]  There's only four chairs.
[11092.93s -> 11100.16s]  Oh, what?
[11100.16s -> 11100.80s]  That was quick.
[11114.55s -> 11115.27s]  Okay, there's only two.
[11115.27s -> 11115.99s]  I gotta be ready.
[11115.99s -> 11117.51s]  This blinking is hurting my head.
[11134.26s -> 11135.78s]  I remember where I'm going here, where I am.
[11145.51s -> 11146.64s]  Oh, my God.
[11146.64s -> 11147.36s]  Where am I?
[11147.36s -> 11149.91s]  What happened?
[11149.91s -> 11150.15s]  What?
[11151.35s -> 11152.18s]  I did it.
[11152.98s -> 11154.34s]  I just like failed the game.
[11164.48s -> 11165.28s]  Oh, shit.
[11165.28s -> 11165.60s]  Okay.
[11166.16s -> 11170.21s]  This is fast.
[11187.35s -> 11189.67s]  It's so hard when I don't have it memorized completely.
[11189.67s -> 11190.39s]  I just don't.
[11213.16s -> 11214.24s]  What?
[11214.24s -> 11214.48s]  What?
[11228.56s -> 11229.52s]  I went...
[11229.52s -> 11240.71s]  What are you drinking?
[11246.77s -> 11247.65s]  What just happened?
[11248.29s -> 11251.97s]  There's one velvet chair girl dead.
[11253.01s -> 11261.83s]  You lost musical chairs so you die.
[11261.83s -> 11261.99s]  No.
[11271.01s -> 11271.49s]  No way.
[11272.21s -> 11274.21s]  We hadn't even started going at it yet.
[11274.93s -> 11277.65s]  For her, the most important battle was lost.
[11280.13s -> 11280.69s]  Oh, no.
[11283.89s -> 11285.49s]  That monster thing.
[11285.49s -> 11287.65s]  It's getting super weird over here.
[11287.65s -> 11288.69s]  It's freaking out.
[11288.69s -> 11290.37s]  Suicide by orange juice.
[11299.36s -> 11300.40s]  Isn't that hilarious?
[11301.20s -> 11303.20s]  Well, time to get to work.
[11304.16s -> 11304.72s]  Oh, boy.
[11305.44s -> 11305.76s]  Okay.
[11306.56s -> 11307.76s]  Here comes the actual fight.
[11312.92s -> 11314.79s]  Whoa.
[11314.79s -> 11315.11s]  All right.
[11323.01s -> 11325.20s]  That's an instant kill.
[11336.95s -> 11340.21s]  We try with one half times attack power.
[11340.21s -> 11341.65s]  Thank you for the cheat code.
[11352.64s -> 11353.36s]  Pity mode.
[11355.84s -> 11356.60s]  Okay.
[11356.60s -> 11358.12s]  So what's the strategy here?
[11359.00s -> 11362.40s]  Is it about on time?
[11371.40s -> 11371.56s]  All right.
[11371.56s -> 11373.64s]  You have to wait until it's a big long one and then you start swinging.
[11374.44s -> 11375.17s]  Okay.
[11375.17s -> 11375.25s]  Go.
[11375.25s -> 11375.73s]  Now get in.
[11377.33s -> 11380.05s]  Don't get greedy.
[11380.05s -> 11381.09s]  It's about not being greedy.
[11381.97s -> 11392.76s]  It's going to touch me.
[11392.76s -> 11393.56s]  Don't let it touch you.
[11394.44s -> 11401.57s]  Is that hitting?
[11404.36s -> 11405.19s]  Whoa.
[11412.10s -> 11412.50s]  Okay.
[11412.50s -> 11412.66s]  No.
[11413.46s -> 11419.35s]  He's not doing it longer anymore.
[11420.31s -> 11422.16s]  There we go.
[11432.07s -> 11432.71s]  What am I doing?
[11433.91s -> 11434.79s]  That was really stupid.
[11434.79s -> 11434.95s]  Okay.
[11434.95s -> 11435.35s]  I'm fine.
[11461.76s -> 11462.88s]  Don't let it touch you.
[11462.88s -> 11463.44s]  She's always dead.
[11474.92s -> 11476.69s]  I'm on a fucking battery power.
[11496.95s -> 11498.31s]  Adrian.
[11498.31s -> 11499.03s]  Raspberry.
[11499.75s -> 11501.27s]  Adrian.
[11501.27s -> 11502.39s]  Raspberry.
[11502.39s -> 11503.03s]  Strawberry.
[11504.07s -> 11505.51s]  We're just two shitty Pokemons.
[11508.34s -> 11508.90s]  Somebody said that.
[11508.90s -> 11509.46s]  I was funny.
[11514.37s -> 11526.98s]  Oh my.
[11536.82s -> 11542.92s]  Omega L.
[11542.92s -> 11543.64s]  What's that sound?
[11544.28s -> 11546.56s]  She's crying.
[11546.56s -> 11549.76s]  It really is just like tears.
[11553.06s -> 11557.33s]  I think I have the extra power.
[11561.12s -> 11561.84s]  11,000.
[11562.56s -> 11572.72s]  Congratulations.
[11573.76s -> 11578.08s]  You have been recognized as number six in the galactic rankings.
[11578.64s -> 11581.92s]  I still got a long way to go, but this is getting kind of fun.
[11582.48s -> 11587.52s]  If I take down the baddest dude in the galaxy, then I'll be the baddest dude in the galaxy.
[11587.52s -> 11587.84s]  Right?
[11588.64s -> 11589.76s]  Rise up, Travis.
[11590.40s -> 11591.76s]  Higher and higher.
[11591.76s -> 11593.44s]  To the edge of the universe.
[11594.80s -> 11595.60s]  He won by cheating.
[11595.60s -> 11597.44s]  I'm going all the way to the edge.
[11598.32s -> 11598.82s]  Meow.
[11600.48s -> 11606.50s]  Who's number five?
[11608.23s -> 11608.95s]  Midori.
[11609.59s -> 11611.03s]  Midori Kawa.
[11611.91s -> 11624.42s]  I just noticed the planets on the right.
[11624.98s -> 11629.08s]  The Earth is a star.
[11629.80s -> 11631.56s]  Oh, yeah.
[11631.56s -> 11634.87s]  Back to the existential talk.
[11635.83s -> 11638.80s]  I don't even remember what we were talking about.
[11638.80s -> 11639.76s]  We were talking about being immortal.
[11640.40s -> 11644.72s]  And like when you see the sun about to explode, you just like turn it off.
[11644.72s -> 11648.20s]  And then we had, I don't know the rules.
[11649.00s -> 11664.56s]  Immortal means unkillable by definition.
[11669.83s -> 11677.46s]  Well, hey, what about never age, but you can die of anything else?
[11678.34s -> 11680.96s]  Yeah, then I mean, after like a few hundred years,
[11680.96s -> 11683.04s]  you would have experienced Disney World 50 times.
[11683.60s -> 11685.20s]  You would have traveled the world 10 times.
[11685.76s -> 11688.32s]  You'd have eaten every single food probably 50 times over.
[11689.20s -> 11693.17s]  I think it's like three or 400 years.
[11701.24s -> 11703.40s]  You would just die in like a car crash.
[11703.48s -> 11704.04s]  Or something.
[11704.68s -> 11705.40s]  Wait, hold on.
[11710.50s -> 11713.78s]  Why am I assuming that I'm going to live for 400 years?
[11715.30s -> 11718.82s]  That's exponentially giving me more time to die by something.
[11718.82s -> 11720.55s]  Like get hit by a bus.
[11721.49s -> 11724.29s]  Or like fall down like a ditch or something.
[11724.29s -> 11729.06s]  Statistically speaking, yes.
[11729.06s -> 11729.70s]  Huh.
[11729.70s -> 11735.35s]  Interesting.
[11735.35s -> 11741.40s]  Statistically speaking, you'd probably be guaranteed to die in a few hundred years.
[11741.96s -> 11743.48s]  Regardless of if I aged or not.
[11744.48s -> 11744.98s]  Shit.
[11745.76s -> 11751.09s]  You know, you don't even really think about that too much.
[11751.65s -> 11754.56s]  What are the chances, somebody look this up.
[11755.12s -> 11757.52s]  What are the chances of somebody being struck by lightning?
[11760.00s -> 11761.20s]  What is that actual chance?
[11761.84s -> 11764.00s]  Is the average person lives to be about what?
[11764.00s -> 11765.92s]  75 to 90 years old?
[11765.92s -> 11767.36s]  Like 80 to 90?
[11767.36s -> 11771.68s]  It's one in what?
[11771.68s -> 11773.20s]  One in like 500,000?
[11773.20s -> 11774.00s]  One in five million?
[11774.88s -> 11775.44s]  Hold on.
[11775.44s -> 11776.72s]  Hold that, we'll get back to this in a minute.
[11781.22s -> 11784.10s]  If you lived forever, thousands of years,
[11784.82s -> 11788.74s]  would you statistically be struck by lightning and die at some point?
[11791.14s -> 11791.94s]  Going back to work.
[11792.66s -> 11794.82s]  Miss Christelle, I'm leaving him to you.
[11795.38s -> 11795.88s]  Dammit!
[11796.42s -> 11797.22s]  Son of a bitch.
[11797.86s -> 11803.65s]  That's not how stats work.
[11804.47s -> 11805.11s]  Right.
[11805.11s -> 11809.75s]  But if you lived for like 50, like 500,000 years on Earth,
[11812.34s -> 11814.66s]  you probably are going to get struck by lightning and die at some point.
[11817.89s -> 11820.21s]  Just because you're giving it, it's just going to happen eventually.
[11820.85s -> 11836.47s]  Just only live in a sunny area.
[11836.47s -> 11837.75s]  They got lightning here, man.
[11844.16s -> 11846.80s]  The Underground Society series is so great.
[11847.36s -> 11849.76s]  Miyake's film is just blazing.
[11849.76s -> 11854.56s]  Kitamura is so bad at being an assassin.
[11854.56s -> 11855.68s]  I can totally tell.
[11855.68s -> 11857.44s]  Oh, MonkaW there is lightning?
[11857.44s -> 11859.04s]  He's got the same eyes as you.
[11859.04s -> 11860.93s]  He definitely gives up.
[11860.93s -> 11862.77s]  There are so many other things that are more likely.
[11862.77s -> 11866.37s]  Yeah, but those increase exponentially if you live for thousands of years.
[11866.37s -> 11867.41s]  Yagami no Kitsu shit done.
[11867.41s -> 11872.36s]  One of these days, man, Kitamura's Underground series.
[11872.36s -> 11875.22s]  Shinjuku is so awesome.
[11875.22s -> 11877.22s]  Shinjuku is like some kind of paradise.
[11877.22s -> 11880.02s]  Statistically speaking, carrying a bunch of Oreos in my hand.
[11880.02s -> 11881.30s]  God damn, I want to check out Shinjuku sometime.
[11881.30s -> 11883.06s]  Up to like my bedroom.
[11883.14s -> 11884.50s]  And falling down the stairs.
[11885.38s -> 11888.58s]  Exponentially increases when that happens 50,000 times.
[11889.99s -> 11891.03s]  Eventually.
[11891.03s -> 11897.17s]  I wonder what would get me though.
[11897.17s -> 11897.57s]  You know what I mean?
[11897.57s -> 11899.89s]  What would it be if like if I was guaranteed like immortal.
[11900.69s -> 11901.49s]  Like I don't die.
[11902.29s -> 11906.05s]  Like I'm just I just live for 100,000 years.
[11906.05s -> 11907.57s]  I wonder what would actually be the thing to get me.
[11913.43s -> 11914.95s]  I think I'd get attacked by a bird.
[11914.95s -> 11918.15s]  I really think I think a bird would like swoop down and fucking take my head off.
[11918.71s -> 11920.72s]  Like an eagle would just decapitate me or something.
[11920.72s -> 11922.56s]  Like I would get attacked by an eagle and die.
[11922.56s -> 11923.60s]  I think that's really what it would be.
[11926.48s -> 11930.88s]  After like a year, like 400 and like like 400,000 like an eagle.
[11930.88s -> 11933.36s]  I'm going to be in the wrong place somewhere and I'm going to get attacked by a fucking eagle.
[11933.36s -> 11934.32s]  It's going to rip my eyes out.
[11934.88s -> 11938.71s]  All right, I've got a new we're going to close.
[11938.71s -> 11951.03s]  I want to see what's that mountain there.
[11951.03s -> 11951.83s]  It is Death Mountain.
[11952.56s -> 11953.60s]  Oh, I like it.
[11953.60s -> 11960.29s]  Do you have any other pants?
[11960.85s -> 11969.33s]  I want to change my pants.
[11969.33s -> 11971.35s]  Which one?
[11971.35s -> 11972.79s]  That's my angry goose.
[11977.00s -> 11978.12s]  No jacket off.
[11978.12s -> 11988.93s]  Yeah, we'll wear this for a little while.
[11994.23s -> 11999.45s]  What's up?
[12000.31s -> 12001.19s]  Gene?
[12001.19s -> 12002.55s]  Like his brain.
[12003.27s -> 12017.78s]  Okay, wow.
[12017.78s -> 12018.74s]  Go for 25.
[12018.74s -> 12020.10s]  I'm not going for 25.
[12021.06s -> 12023.75s]  No, I wouldn't want to be immortal though.
[12024.39s -> 12039.49s]  Okay, how much?
[12039.49s -> 12042.16s]  Let's keep going.
[12044.63s -> 12047.83s]  I need like at least three or four thousand Wesson, right?
[12047.83s -> 12053.43s]  Just check the weather wherever you go and you'll be fine.
[12053.43s -> 12060.93s]  You can't check the weather for eagles swooping down with a vicious look in their eye.
[12061.49s -> 12063.56s]  There's no forecast for that.
[12063.56s -> 12071.60s]  All right, we're going to Neo Brazil.
[12071.60s -> 12072.32s]  It's a new zone.
[12073.20s -> 12075.08s]  Oh, let me turn in these.
[12075.88s -> 12076.68s]  I have a couple of cards.
[12077.48s -> 12080.72s]  Don't I have a scorpion too?
[12081.28s -> 12083.16s]  Do I have a scorpion?
[12083.16s -> 12083.66s]  No.
[12092.42s -> 12093.14s]  Nope.
[12093.14s -> 12095.97s]  Come to Brazil.
[12095.97s -> 12097.17s]  He's going to Brazil.
[12097.17s -> 12097.67s]  Finally.
[12099.33s -> 12114.20s]  What the fuck?
[12114.20s -> 12115.72s]  Yes, there is a check eagle schedule.
[12115.72s -> 12117.16s]  Just see where they play.
[12117.16s -> 12129.46s]  Hey, good.
[12130.02s -> 12132.79s]  Oh, vinyl clubs.
[12133.35s -> 12135.43s]  I don't know what that is.
[12135.43s -> 12141.30s]  What if you're immortal and get caught in an avalanche or a landslide and got stuck?
[12142.02s -> 12142.58s]  I would die.
[12142.58s -> 12144.74s]  Well, because I assume I still have to eat food.
[12146.29s -> 12147.09s]  I still have to eat.
[12149.01s -> 12151.09s]  It seems like we're changing the rules here a few times over.
[12159.57s -> 12160.69s]  You're immortal.
[12160.69s -> 12161.81s]  But do I have to eat?
[12164.85s -> 12168.69s]  There's a very specific bunch of rules here that we need to get clear.
[12169.49s -> 12170.61s]  Do I have to eat?
[12171.97s -> 12173.25s]  I don't have to eat food.
[12179.33s -> 12181.33s]  No, only for pleasure.
[12183.62s -> 12184.12s]  Okay.
[12192.71s -> 12194.79s]  You will never have to use the bathroom again.
[12195.35s -> 12197.86s]  You see, I don't know if I buy this though.
[12198.50s -> 12205.68s]  Of course you would have to use the bathroom.
[12205.68s -> 12206.48s]  Where would anything go?
[12206.96s -> 12209.20s]  Do you just disappear as a black hole in my stomach?
[12213.09s -> 12214.05s]  Do I have organs?
[12214.77s -> 12217.24s]  Well, I don't have organs then.
[12217.24s -> 12220.92s]  I'm just like skin filled with air, like cosmic air.
[12221.56s -> 12234.93s]  You have a skin and a brain.
[12234.93s -> 12236.82s]  I'm a jellyfish.
[12237.38s -> 12243.83s]  Okay, Neo Brazil.
[12244.39s -> 12247.32s]  All right.
[12247.32s -> 12247.88s]  How much money?
[12247.88s -> 12248.12s]  Fine.
[12248.12s -> 12250.12s]  Designated match when you do three.
[12250.12s -> 12250.84s]  Let's go right here.
[12256.00s -> 12277.81s]  What if you had to poop?
[12277.81s -> 12278.21s]  Whatever.
[12278.21s -> 12280.53s]  That one's weird because that one doesn't make any sense.
[12280.53s -> 12282.37s]  You're just trying to give me, say, a gross thing on stream.
[12282.37s -> 12283.25s]  And it was really close.
[12283.25s -> 12283.89s]  You almost had it.
[12288.02s -> 12291.78s]  Spin death throw.
[12291.78s -> 12292.42s]  Strawberry.
[12294.84s -> 12296.60s]  Screw bluster death kick.
[12298.28s -> 12299.48s]  Death melt shower.
[12300.20s -> 12300.36s]  All right.
[12300.36s -> 12301.24s]  Let's kill that guy.
[12301.24s -> 12301.96s]  Double kill.
[12307.48s -> 12308.60s]  I'm trying to get a 100-hit combo.
[12308.60s -> 12310.68s]  It's going to be hard with that weird guy over there though.
[12314.32s -> 12314.56s]  Kill.
[12315.36s -> 12316.85s]  That's good.
[12317.81s -> 12319.11s]  77 hit.
[12320.24s -> 12320.80s]  80 hit.
[12320.80s -> 12321.20s]  Strawberry.
[12327.83s -> 12331.00s]  Screw bluster death kick.
[12331.00s -> 12332.04s]  Ooh, 88.
[12333.24s -> 12333.72s]  Fever.
[12334.52s -> 12335.16s]  93.
[12336.20s -> 12337.32s]  95.
[12337.32s -> 12337.96s]  Give me 100.
[12342.82s -> 12343.32s]  Yeah.
[12349.25s -> 12350.61s]  Death melt shower.
[12350.61s -> 12351.89s]  Gravity death force.
[12352.69s -> 12353.73s]  120.
[12354.53s -> 12356.76s]  Come here.
[12356.76s -> 12357.00s]  Come here.
[12357.00s -> 12357.08s]  Come here.
[12357.08s -> 12357.48s]  Come here.
[12357.48s -> 12360.18s]  Come here.
[12360.18s -> 12361.46s]  Oh, I lost it.
[12362.02s -> 12362.82s]  Screw bluster death kick.
[12362.82s -> 12367.36s]  I'm trying to build a combo on these guys.
[12367.36s -> 12368.08s]  They have a shield.
[12368.08s -> 12369.94s]  Right off.
[12369.94s -> 12371.38s]  Spin death throw.
[12371.38s -> 12373.00s]  I just took one damage already.
[12373.00s -> 12373.40s]  Fuck you.
[12373.40s -> 12373.80s]  I hate you.
[12374.76s -> 12375.48s]  Stupidest enemy.
[12380.04s -> 12380.84s]  You spuck up the flow.
[12394.32s -> 12396.34s]  I just want to correct the record.
[12396.34s -> 12398.42s]  Jellyfish don't have brains.
[12398.42s -> 12400.02s]  They have what's known as a nerve net.
[12400.02s -> 12403.30s]  I like you, but don't want you spreading dangerous misinformation on your platform.
[12404.26s -> 12406.88s]  Time that guy out for an hour.
[12407.44s -> 12410.79s]  I'm kidding.
[12410.79s -> 12411.27s]  I'm kidding.
[12411.83s -> 12412.39s]  10 seconds.
[12428.63s -> 12428.87s]  Yeah.
[12428.87s -> 12430.31s]  And that's like saying we don't have...
[12430.31s -> 12431.35s]  A brain is not a brain.
[12431.35s -> 12432.87s]  It's just electromagnetic pudding.
[12434.37s -> 12435.09s]  Chunky pudding.
[12435.73s -> 12437.06s]  See?
[12437.06s -> 12438.26s]  I can say smart things too.
[12448.20s -> 12448.76s]  Is this...
[12448.76s -> 12449.24s]  What is this?
[12452.52s -> 12453.80s]  Free wave defense mission.
[12453.80s -> 12454.76s]  I'll do it.
[12454.76s -> 12461.35s]  There's so many weird animals on this planet.
[12461.35s -> 12462.47s]  So many weird organisms.
[12467.76s -> 12469.20s]  Let's get this over with.
[12469.92s -> 12470.96s]  Wave one.
[12475.92s -> 12478.00s]  Spin death throw.
[12478.00s -> 12481.28s]  Nice.
[12481.28s -> 12481.76s]  Give it to me.
[12482.48s -> 12483.68s]  Yeah.
[12483.68s -> 12484.96s]  I thought it was better than that.
[12484.96s -> 12492.00s]  Can I stay in the same wave?
[12493.44s -> 12495.38s]  Come on, wave two.
[12495.38s -> 12496.34s]  Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[12496.34s -> 12496.74s]  Give it to me.
[12508.77s -> 12509.57s]  Try not to take a hit.
[12510.45s -> 12513.11s]  That'll hit too.
[12524.93s -> 12525.41s]  Ooh.
[12525.41s -> 12525.89s]  Full armor.
[12525.89s -> 12526.45s]  Let's go.
[12526.45s -> 12526.85s]  No.
[12526.85s -> 12528.05s]  What did I do that for?
[12528.05s -> 12528.29s]  Fuck.
[12529.73s -> 12530.85s]  That was stupid.
[12530.85s -> 12531.57s]  I should have...
[12531.57s -> 12532.69s]  I'm so mad right now.
[12534.37s -> 12536.64s]  I could have ended it immediately.
[12538.79s -> 12539.19s]  Oof.
[12539.19s -> 12539.91s]  What an oof.
[12539.91s -> 12541.03s]  That's just actual oof.
[12541.91s -> 12542.47s]  Unbelievable.
[12542.47s -> 12551.80s]  I could have ended it immediately.
[12551.80s -> 12552.44s]  I'm so sad.
[12567.54s -> 12571.16s]  Ooh.
[12571.16s -> 12571.72s]  Side step.
[12572.68s -> 12573.56s]  Everybody free.
[12586.63s -> 12586.95s]  Ooh.
[12588.31s -> 12589.91s]  So kill them both.
[12591.43s -> 12598.21s]  Thank you.
[12599.25s -> 12609.62s]  Oh.
[12609.62s -> 12610.66s]  I got Mustang mode.
[12611.46s -> 12613.60s]  Holy shit.
[12613.60s -> 12613.84s]  All right.
[12613.84s -> 12614.32s]  That's ass.
[12615.12s -> 12616.00s]  Absolute ass plus.
[12616.88s -> 12623.40s]  Couldn't even see what was happening on the screen.
[12623.40s -> 12624.28s]  That's how you know it was good.
[12629.41s -> 12629.97s]  Yeah.
[12629.97s -> 12644.64s]  That was really cool.
[12645.52s -> 12646.00s]  Very fun.
[12646.00s -> 12646.64s]  How much do I need?
[12647.36s -> 12650.23s]  Okay.
[12650.23s -> 12650.71s]  I have...
[12654.36s -> 12656.04s]  40,000 coins to enter.
[12656.68s -> 12660.31s]  I think I have like 30.
[12660.95s -> 12670.00s]  I'm gonna do a couple of the jobs after this.
[12670.00s -> 12677.68s]  Game's a little loud.
[12677.68s -> 12677.84s]  Yeah.
[12677.84s -> 12678.88s]  I'll turn it down.
[12678.88s -> 12687.36s]  All right.
[12687.36s -> 12687.60s]  Again.
[12693.20s -> 12694.00s]  Land, please.
[12694.96s -> 12696.24s]  Oh, bad.
[12696.24s -> 12696.72s]  It's okay.
[12697.36s -> 12703.14s]  I'm behind, really.
[12703.14s -> 12704.50s]  Get out of here.
[12704.50s -> 12717.35s]  That was a perfect dodge.
[12717.35s -> 12718.39s]  I felt like that was a perfect dodge.
[12718.39s -> 12719.43s]  I think I got hit from the other guy.
[12737.17s -> 12739.43s]  Let's give this a try.
[12744.40s -> 12745.44s]  I just kicked him in the air.
[12752.77s -> 12753.41s]  Hit them both.
[12753.41s -> 12753.97s]  Get them both.
[12753.97s -> 12754.37s]  Get them both.
[12754.37s -> 12754.85s]  Get them both.
[12754.85s -> 12755.33s]  Get them both.
[12755.33s -> 12755.97s]  Get them both.
[12755.97s -> 12756.29s]  Kill them.
[12757.25s -> 12763.60s]  Oh, shit.
[12763.60s -> 12764.80s]  Watch the health.
[12764.80s -> 12775.57s]  He's invisible, right?
[12775.57s -> 12775.81s]  Okay.
[12775.81s -> 12776.93s]  Wait till he comes out.
[12776.93s -> 12777.65s]  Perfect dodge it.
[12777.65s -> 12777.97s]  And...
[12782.85s -> 12783.97s]  Come out of there.
[12783.97s -> 12784.77s]  I'm wasting time here.
[12794.26s -> 12794.50s]  And...
[12798.50s -> 12800.47s]  I'm gonna crush you.
[12806.64s -> 12807.76s]  SS streak is over.
[12807.76s -> 12809.20s]  Well, it might actually be an S.
[12814.39s -> 12815.35s]  Ah, it's okay.
[12827.83s -> 12828.45s]  All right.
[12828.45s -> 12830.45s]  This is the third time this guy's called.
[12830.45s -> 12847.11s]  Very curious now.
[12847.11s -> 12847.59s]  My reason.
[12847.59s -> 12848.95s]  You need my reason, right?
[12848.95s -> 12852.58s]  Oh, we've gotten so close.
[12853.30s -> 12855.67s]  Have you thought of a reason?
[12856.95s -> 12857.75s]  Yeah.
[12857.75s -> 12859.36s]  It's a hassle.
[12865.41s -> 12867.41s]  Just thinking about him makes me nauseous.
[12868.05s -> 12871.54s]  I want him to disappear.
[12872.26s -> 12874.10s]  I feel like I can't breathe.
[12875.33s -> 12877.49s]  Like I have something stuck in my throat.
[12877.49s -> 12879.83s]  I feel like I'm gonna die.
[12884.53s -> 12887.88s]  All just too much to deal with.
[12887.88s -> 12891.40s]  So, am I trying to get somebody to kill Fu?
[12891.40s -> 12892.84s]  I think that's what's happening.
[12892.84s -> 12899.44s]  I see.
[12900.00s -> 12903.41s]  How self-centered.
[12903.41s -> 12907.36s]  I've heard your reason.
[12908.08s -> 12909.65s]  I'll accept your request.
[12910.45s -> 12914.85s]  Out of consideration for the utterly pitiful weakness of your heart.
[12915.65s -> 12918.29s]  I don't care why you do it.
[12918.29s -> 12919.41s]  I just want it done.
[12920.05s -> 12923.75s]  In that case, we'll enter into a formal agreement next time.
[12924.39s -> 12928.40s]  An actual physical contract is not necessary, however.
[12929.04s -> 12930.92s]  Shit, we have to do this again?
[12931.56s -> 12934.05s]  Whatever, fine.
[12934.69s -> 12935.65s]  Next time it is.
[12938.32s -> 12939.28s]  What if it is Fu?
[12940.08s -> 12943.57s]  Uh-oh.
[12943.57s -> 12945.33s]  Calling the sus guy at 3 a.m.
[12957.94s -> 12959.06s]  I wanna do a couple of jobs.
[12959.70s -> 12966.15s]  I did that match job, but I wanna do another job.
[12966.71s -> 12976.05s]  Do not call the sus guy at 3 a.m.
[12976.05s -> 12977.25s]  I really wanna make that video.
[12978.05s -> 12980.82s]  I would love to.
[12989.91s -> 12990.79s]  For god's sake, don't.
[12990.79s -> 12992.23s]  I kind of need to, though.
[12992.23s -> 12992.79s]  I have to.
[12993.35s -> 12999.25s]  I almost need to do it out of...
[12999.89s -> 13001.22s]  Okay.
[13001.86s -> 13007.06s]  Does that video have more video views than any of the main channel videos I've ever made?
[13007.86s -> 13013.30s]  If I do it the same way I do it exactly like the videos act,
[13013.30s -> 13014.10s]  it's not a joke.
[13014.10s -> 13015.38s]  I don't make it a funny joke.
[13016.10s -> 13019.38s]  It's just I make one of those videos and try as hard as I can to do that.
[13020.84s -> 13021.24s]  No, yeah.
[13021.24s -> 13022.36s]  No swearing.
[13022.36s -> 13024.28s]  Just like, oh my god, guys.
[13025.08s -> 13026.20s]  What the heck is happening?
[13027.00s -> 13027.72s]  Don't call him.
[13028.36s -> 13033.48s]  It's, like, I would just put on, like, the thing and just see if I can do it.
[13033.48s -> 13034.44s]  Holy sh...
[13034.44s -> 13035.40s]  I can't say holy shit, right?
[13037.38s -> 13039.38s]  Head off to conquer the space monster.
[13040.69s -> 13041.01s]  Yeah.
[13047.19s -> 13049.11s]  Like, holy crap, guys.
[13049.11s -> 13050.71s]  Oh my god, guys.
[13050.71s -> 13051.75s]  Oh my goodness.
[13053.40s -> 13054.36s]  What the heck?
[13055.68s -> 13056.48s]  Yeah, I could pull it off.
[13068.00s -> 13068.88s]  Can I already fight this guy?
[13069.52s -> 13071.35s]  Round two.
[13071.99s -> 13077.62s]  Round two it is.
[13085.43s -> 13093.34s]  Watch it.
[13093.88s -> 13098.85s]  Gonna break that ice.
[13099.65s -> 13116.04s]  Watch the rockets.
[13124.52s -> 13125.16s]  Ice coming in.
[13125.88s -> 13126.38s]  Cannon.
[13138.76s -> 13139.62s]  Oh.
[13140.32s -> 13140.82s]  Yeah.
[13151.72s -> 13152.36s]  Hit the core.
[13153.40s -> 13157.59s]  Core.
[13158.21s -> 13164.87s]  Come on, his mouth is open.
[13164.87s -> 13165.37s]  Hit it.
[13165.99s -> 13168.90s]  Core coming up, right?
[13169.46s -> 13169.96s]  Oh, shit.
[13178.61s -> 13179.97s]  Death is part of life.
[13180.61s -> 13182.52s]  Not if you're immortal.
[13183.08s -> 13191.33s]  All right, let's see if I can get him right here.
[13193.68s -> 13194.18s]  Cannon.
[13194.80s -> 13199.08s]  All right, got it.
[13199.08s -> 13199.58s]  Nice.
[13206.60s -> 13210.04s]  Go back to space.
[13211.80s -> 13221.73s]  I'm being called a fuckhead.
[13221.73s -> 13222.45s]  I just got here.
[13223.17s -> 13224.72s]  That's just what he does.
[13226.40s -> 13226.90s]  Hey.
[13227.44s -> 13227.94s]  Ooh.
[13230.85s -> 13231.35s]  All right.
[13231.81s -> 13242.92s]  Okay.
[13243.14s -> 13246.76s]  Go for...
[13247.54s -> 13249.33s]  There's a couple of other things on the map.
[13249.97s -> 13251.89s]  Yeah, I'm not gonna do this one yet.
[13251.89s -> 13253.17s]  Actually, I probably can just get out of the way.
[13253.17s -> 13253.67s]  Yeah.
[13254.05s -> 13255.03s]  This is the main one.
[13255.59s -> 13256.90s]  I'll get this out of the way.
[13257.62s -> 13261.04s]  And then we're gonna go do some jobs around the city.
[13271.80s -> 13272.60s]  Something that I've noticed.
[13272.60s -> 13273.80s]  Let's get deadly.
[13273.80s -> 13276.21s]  I feel like I'm like halfway through the game.
[13276.77s -> 13277.27s]  Right?
[13277.27s -> 13278.13s]  Because it feels like that.
[13279.60s -> 13280.10s]  Um.
[13281.92s -> 13282.42s]  I only...
[13282.80s -> 13284.00s]  Any other beam katanas?
[13285.88s -> 13287.08s]  When do I get another katana?
[13287.80s -> 13295.00s]  Oh, I'm looking at chat.
[13295.00s -> 13296.04s]  I'm not playing the video game.
[13297.40s -> 13298.52s]  There's only one.
[13298.52s -> 13299.02s]  Really?
[13299.48s -> 13299.98s]  Oh.
[13301.33s -> 13304.45s]  You know, I haven't really noticed it being a problem or anything.
[13305.01s -> 13307.11s]  It's just like, oh, right, right.
[13307.11s -> 13308.23s]  Where's my other katanas?
[13310.02s -> 13311.30s]  So, yeah, it's fine.
[13313.28s -> 13314.24s]  All right, time to play the game.
[13314.80s -> 13316.88s]  I've literally just been looking to my left.
[13326.00s -> 13330.56s]  Not a big deal, but it's a weird change to make.
[13331.36s -> 13331.86s]  Oh.
[13337.75s -> 13338.25s]  Where's he at?
[13338.25s -> 13338.75s]  There he is.
[13338.75s -> 13339.25s]  He's in this room.
[13339.25s -> 13339.75s]  Get out of there.
[13347.64s -> 13348.14s]  Yep.
[13349.27s -> 13350.23s]  Battery's almost done.
[13351.51s -> 13354.34s]  I just double dodged, but I can't hit him.
[13354.34s -> 13354.84s]  Fuck.
[13355.38s -> 13357.21s]  Really?
[13368.66s -> 13369.16s]  Shit.
[13369.70s -> 13373.92s]  Watch out for those stupid parasite things.
[13374.48s -> 13386.62s]  Goodbye.
[13388.40s -> 13397.16s]  Watch out for those parasite things.
[13407.84s -> 13408.88s]  Oh, all right.
[13409.44s -> 13417.14s]  Throw him back into that.
[13417.70s -> 13423.54s]  He's dead.
[13423.54s -> 13424.04s]  Oops.
[13424.04s -> 13425.22s]  All fuckberries.
[13425.94s -> 13430.52s]  Oh, that seems to be more in-depth and free.
[13430.52s -> 13431.64s]  More katanas aren't needed.
[13440.12s -> 13440.62s]  Yeah.
[13442.05s -> 13445.73s]  I think with the chips in the glove makes it a little more interesting.
[13446.53s -> 13451.70s]  Although I say that, but I've only been using the same free the whole game.
[13456.00s -> 13456.80s]  I have enough money.
[13457.36s -> 13459.59s]  I want to go do the jobs.
[13460.15s -> 13471.56s]  There's a couple of jobs here that I want to do.
[13472.20s -> 13478.96s]  There's a toilet to unclog, but what is this?
[13479.44s -> 13484.02s]  A t-shirt alien?
[13492.52s -> 13493.70s]  Okay.
[13494.63s -> 13496.23s]  Uniform of Don Mai Sushi.
[13496.23s -> 13496.95s]  I love it.
[13496.95s -> 13498.95s]  Defeat a total of 50 enemies.
[13498.95s -> 13499.91s]  I've done that for sure.
[13500.47s -> 13503.54s]  Yeah, I want that.
[13509.09s -> 13509.59s]  Nice.
[13509.97s -> 13510.78s]  I love it.
[13511.24s -> 13513.75s]  Looks pretty clean.
[13517.52s -> 13518.64s]  Oh, toilet.
[13518.64s -> 13530.63s]  Matches the bike.
[13530.63s -> 13531.13s]  It does.
[13537.83s -> 13539.19s]  End of the stream voice.
[13539.19s -> 13539.69s]  What?
[13541.19s -> 13542.47s]  No, I'm just relaxing, man.
[13542.47s -> 13542.97s]  I'm good.
[13544.23s -> 13545.11s]  Ending the stream.
[13566.05s -> 13572.84s]  I just wish that that NPC just kind of glanced over.
[13573.64s -> 13574.84s]  And then glanced back.
[13574.84s -> 13576.60s]  It'll be a nice touch.
[13589.03s -> 13590.47s]  There's a race over here.
[13590.47s -> 13594.48s]  This has got to be level four at this point.
[13594.48s -> 13595.76s]  We're level four and five?
[13595.76s -> 13596.48s]  I wonder.
[13596.48s -> 13598.77s]  Oh, let's get this out of the way.
[13605.35s -> 13605.85s]  Yeah.
[13607.16s -> 13608.36s]  Bike missions.
[13608.36s -> 13609.24s]  Yeah, I've done this.
[13611.33s -> 13612.21s]  Except this request.
[13612.21s -> 13613.81s]  Yeah, but didn't I already do this?
[13614.37s -> 13618.79s]  Why does it make me do the tutorial again?
[13624.58s -> 13625.94s]  Is this better than one and two?
[13626.74s -> 13627.24s]  Yes.
[13629.00s -> 13630.04s]  Absolutely without question.
[13637.97s -> 13640.37s]  Holy shit, that's a sharp turn.
[13640.37s -> 13677.59s]  I got to keep in mind that that turn happens because that sucks.
[13677.59s -> 13678.63s]  He loves the game.
[13678.63s -> 13679.13s]  I do.
[13682.13s -> 13682.93s]  I think it's more...
[13685.64s -> 13687.56s]  Well, it's definitely longer, right?
[13687.56s -> 13692.50s]  I think it's...
[13692.50s -> 13693.14s]  I don't know.
[13693.14s -> 13700.64s]  It's in a weird place because they've removed the levels in the game from what it seems.
[13701.36s -> 13704.53s]  They just made a bunch of open world mini games.
[13704.53s -> 13705.89s]  Some of them are fights, some of them aren't.
[13707.84s -> 13711.92s]  And something about that doesn't like take away from the other games.
[13712.56s -> 13715.09s]  But it makes the whole process just streamlined.
[13715.09s -> 13716.05s]  You can kind of do whatever you want.
[13716.53s -> 13721.70s]  So if you want to do the fighting missions and run around the open world.
[13721.70s -> 13724.18s]  It's more focused on actually just kind of going around and looking at stuff.
[13726.80s -> 13727.52s]  I do some...
[13727.52s -> 13731.68s]  A little bit, I do miss the actual missions where you go run around and fight in corridors and stuff.
[13731.68s -> 13733.28s]  And it's just a wave of enemies.
[13733.28s -> 13733.76s]  You keep going.
[13733.76s -> 13734.40s]  There's a little cut scene.
[13734.40s -> 13735.44s]  A wave of enemies, wave of enemies.
[13735.44s -> 13739.28s]  But at the end of the day, does it really matter if you're doing the same thing?
[13739.28s -> 13742.48s]  You just have to press a button that says, I'd like to do a fight mission, please.
[13742.48s -> 13756.15s]  It does feel weirdly paced.
[13756.15s -> 13758.15s]  Fun to play, but not very immersive for an open world.
[13759.03s -> 13761.35s]  Yeah, I could see that.
[13762.07s -> 13763.03s]  I still think it's better.
[13765.80s -> 13766.84s]  I think it's a better game.
[13768.58s -> 13770.66s]  Something about this one feels more fun than the other two.
[13772.07s -> 13772.79s]  But I don't know.
[13774.93s -> 13776.69s]  There's recency bias is a problem.
[13778.02s -> 13788.07s]  Because I love those little mini games from the second game.
[13788.07s -> 13789.27s]  I think I like this game's...
[13791.32s -> 13794.36s]  This game's feel and this game's kind of storyline.
[13794.36s -> 13797.64s]  I love the kind of superhero aspect of it.
[13797.64s -> 13798.76s]  I think it's funny.
[13798.76s -> 13801.40s]  Because what the hell are you supposed to do with a guy that can kill all the assassins?
[13801.40s -> 13803.40s]  Oh, we just do like a Marvel universe.
[13803.40s -> 13804.36s]  It's funny.
[13812.37s -> 13814.37s]  I don't really miss the other stuff I'm talking about.
[13815.17s -> 13818.74s]  This feels different enough where it's not a problem.
[13818.74s -> 13820.74s]  I haven't really thought about that at all this whole time.
[13821.62s -> 13828.20s]  I really need to kind of beat this before I get a D.
[13847.81s -> 13848.45s]  Don't do that.
[13851.35s -> 13851.59s]  Shit.
[13852.23s -> 13856.13s]  He's right there.
[13856.13s -> 13856.69s]  Just get him.
[13857.33s -> 13865.52s]  Wouldn't you want to be immortal to be able to play all the video games?
[13870.29s -> 13870.61s]  Sure.
[13873.99s -> 13875.27s]  But would you though?
[13875.99s -> 13877.60s]  Would you really want to?
[13878.32s -> 13888.24s]  If it was only a certain amount of media your brain could consume
[13888.24s -> 13890.48s]  before it all really just bleeds together.
[13900.21s -> 13902.79s]  10,000 years of video games?
[13902.79s -> 13904.47s]  I wouldn't remember Super Mario.
[13904.47s -> 13919.17s]  You would just forget about the worst ones.
[13919.17s -> 13926.12s]  I would need to kind of have post-it notes around me at all times
[13926.12s -> 13927.80s]  to remember all the things I thought were cool.
[13928.36s -> 13932.31s]  My fridge would be just all post-it notes
[13932.95s -> 13934.31s]  that I have to look at from time to time.
[13936.80s -> 13937.36s]  A year.
[13938.16s -> 13939.36s]  3,200.
[13943.01s -> 13943.65s]  Game system.
[13945.70s -> 13947.38s]  The Omega Sony.
[13947.38s -> 13948.82s]  The Sony Omega.
[13948.82s -> 13949.70s]  Okay, what was it?
[13951.68s -> 13952.80s]  Liked main character.
[13953.60s -> 13954.80s]  His laugh was funny.
[13955.78s -> 13959.38s]  And attack of the gigantic monster village.
[13960.10s -> 13966.53s]  You'd have to constantly remind yourself of what you thought was interesting.
[13967.17s -> 13983.06s]  There's one.
[13983.62s -> 13984.61s]  Slow it down.
[13985.33s -> 13989.67s]  I have to kill some of these guys.
[13989.67s -> 13990.79s]  They have like, look at the health they have.
[13990.79s -> 13991.43s]  They have no health.
[13992.15s -> 14009.62s]  Damn it.
[14009.62s -> 14011.22s]  I'm not even close either.
[14011.22s -> 14016.53s]  Fuck you.
[14018.72s -> 14019.36s]  No!
[14019.36s -> 14019.76s]  Fuck!
[14019.76s -> 14020.24s]  Come here!
[14020.24s -> 14021.76s]  Oh god.
[14021.76s -> 14024.44s]  I'm ahead of him.
[14024.44s -> 14038.26s]  That turn doesn't even make any sense.
[14038.26s -> 14039.38s]  Why is it even there?
[14040.10s -> 14056.58s]  I don't even care if I get bronze.
[14056.58s -> 14058.20s]  I just want to get these over with.
[14058.20s -> 14067.46s]  All right, we're good.
[14067.46s -> 14073.14s]  If you're immortal, people would find you and experiment on you to find out why.
[14073.94s -> 14075.54s]  Why would you tell anybody?
[14079.84s -> 14080.64s]  I failed it.
[14080.64s -> 14087.96s]  I didn't get a medal.
[14087.96s -> 14091.16s]  I'm not going to walk up to a CIA agent and whisper in his ear and go,
[14091.16s -> 14093.46s]  hey, I'm immortal.
[14093.46s -> 14094.18s]  Nothing kills me.
[14094.18s -> 14094.98s]  I can't die.
[14094.98s -> 14101.67s]  No, you live your whole life.
[14101.67s -> 14104.36s]  And then, no, I wouldn't tell anybody.
[14104.36s -> 14105.64s]  Why would anybody need to know?
[14105.64s -> 14108.85s]  You would just cycle a whole new lifetime, right?
[14108.85s -> 14120.32s]  You wouldn't get old.
[14120.32s -> 14125.38s]  I would just constantly be making new friends.
[14125.38s -> 14126.98s]  But what age are you?
[14126.98s -> 14129.64s]  How old are you?
[14129.64s -> 14130.60s]  How old do you look?
[14134.53s -> 14136.29s]  Am I the age that I am right now?
[14136.29s -> 14136.93s]  Like 30?
[14137.57s -> 14138.37s]  50?
[14138.37s -> 14141.01s]  20?
[14141.01s -> 14142.05s]  You'd be in your prime.
[14146.05s -> 14148.60s]  So what, like 28?
[14148.60s -> 14149.08s]  29?
[14149.08s -> 14149.64s]  30?
[14149.64s -> 14159.60s]  Oh my god.
[14159.60s -> 14160.80s]  I'm so sorry.
[14160.80s -> 14163.12s]  I was up all night and slept in.
[14163.12s -> 14164.08s]  Going to have to cancel.
[14164.80s -> 14170.79s]  My job done laters.
[14177.67s -> 14182.61s]  Oh yeah, you're probably pissed, huh?
[14183.25s -> 14187.19s]  You're going to try to kill me now, right?
[14187.19s -> 14188.71s]  My boyfriend is already on to you.
[14189.35s -> 14191.88s]  If you're going to kill me, he's going to kill you.
[14191.88s -> 14193.24s]  As soon as possible.
[14193.24s -> 14196.34s]  I'm getting in the way with this Travis fight, okay?
[14196.34s -> 14197.94s]  This is serious stuff.
[14197.94s -> 14202.90s]  Who was that?
[14205.40s -> 14207.89s]  Was he just killing people in this restaurant?
[14208.45s -> 14211.78s]  You can't kill my boyfriend.
[14212.74s -> 14213.54s]  What is he doing?
[14221.25s -> 14223.01s]  He just stood up and just blasted that person.
[14223.01s -> 14224.85s]  The person was just enjoying like a tuna melt.
[14225.41s -> 14226.79s]  What the hell was that?
[14239.00s -> 14250.66s]  Do I have enough to level up?
[14250.66s -> 14253.16s]  I feel like I didn't get that many Wesson.
[14253.88s -> 14256.72s]  Could be wrong.
[14256.72s -> 14264.82s]  I had a tuna melt for dinner last night and it was good.
[14265.70s -> 14272.15s]  You guys know that once we start talking about food,
[14272.15s -> 14276.23s]  the stream end countdown is about like one to two hours after that, right?
[14277.03s -> 14278.79s]  I like this shirt.
[14278.79s -> 14279.35s]  I'm going to keep it on.
[14280.87s -> 14288.24s]  The more you tell me how awesome and delicious the food you ate yesterday was,
[14288.24s -> 14290.88s]  the more that like the internal clock has just started.
[14290.88s -> 14297.72s]  I got 10,000.
[14298.44s -> 14306.32s]  Let's go with pull down time reduced on this
[14306.32s -> 14307.68s]  because me and one of my is not going to do it.
[14308.40s -> 14309.83s]  I seem to use them a lot.
[14310.47s -> 14315.22s]  Pull down time reduced again.
[14318.40s -> 14319.76s]  And then the double dodge.
[14319.76s -> 14325.64s]  How do I do this?
[14327.20s -> 14330.08s]  Let's press B while dodging to dodge even further.
[14330.08s -> 14330.96s]  So it's just BB.
[14331.68s -> 14335.76s]  But you know, it's AB actually.
[14335.76s -> 14336.40s]  It's boom, boom.
[14336.40s -> 14336.64s]  Okay.
[14337.92s -> 14339.04s]  Last attack.
[14339.04s -> 14344.74s]  So this is just a normal attack.
[14344.74s -> 14354.34s]  Mash Y to unleash a high speed continuous thrust attack.
[14354.34s -> 14355.22s]  Don't I already do that?
[14358.31s -> 14361.20s]  Eight, nine, and that will go.
[14361.76s -> 14366.00s]  I feel like I already do that move.
[14366.00s -> 14368.95s]  Today's national cheese pizza day.
[14368.95s -> 14369.43s]  Is it really?
[14370.15s -> 14374.80s]  All right.
[14374.80s -> 14377.68s]  I'm going to look at this because I feel like I need to make something.
[14377.68s -> 14378.32s]  I got to do something here.
[14378.96s -> 14380.52s]  We've been doing the extra damage.
[14380.52s -> 14381.16s]  It's cool.
[14381.16s -> 14382.60s]  But I kind of want to go for something else.
[14383.32s -> 14388.98s]  Okay.
[14388.98s -> 14390.82s]  During slow down after a perfect dodge.
[14392.42s -> 14396.23s]  Damage taken.
[14396.23s -> 14397.11s]  I don't want the tanky ones.
[14397.11s -> 14398.71s]  I don't care about the tanky ones.
[14398.71s -> 14403.32s]  Tension gauge depletion.
[14403.32s -> 14407.56s]  That's not bad because that means I get to stay in the cool modes 30% longer.
[14408.28s -> 14416.00s]  Another tanky one.
[14419.91s -> 14420.39s]  Wait, what?
[14420.95s -> 14424.79s]  After a successful perfect dodge, slow time 50% up.
[14425.43s -> 14427.43s]  Does that mean the cool down is reduced?
[14427.43s -> 14430.39s]  Or does that mean I get a slow down?
[14431.03s -> 14435.97s]  Does that mean after a perfect dodge slow time it'll last 50% longer?
[14441.46s -> 14442.18s]  Oh, shit.
[14442.18s -> 14443.22s]  That's really good.
[14443.94s -> 14444.18s]  Wait.
[14444.98s -> 14452.88s]  So if I get three of these, that means it's 150% longer.
[14452.88s -> 14453.76s]  Yeah, I'm going to get one of these.
[14453.76s -> 14454.64s]  That's awesome.
[14454.64s -> 14455.52s]  That's a huge deal.
[14456.08s -> 14460.42s]  Even if I just have one of them.
[14461.22s -> 14464.66s]  I can get two of them.
[14467.14s -> 14467.70s]  I'll come back to it.
[14467.70s -> 14468.82s]  This is 39.
[14468.82s -> 14473.78s]  50% more tension gauge.
[14473.78s -> 14474.42s]  That's pretty good.
[14475.30s -> 14480.58s]  While performing the recharge, power charge amount.
[14480.58s -> 14482.98s]  So I get 50% more charge.
[14483.70s -> 14486.18s]  Essentially, recharging the battery takes half as much time.
[14486.90s -> 14488.58s]  But I don't think that's that big of a deal.
[14489.54s -> 14492.95s]  While walking alerts you when search object is close.
[14493.59s -> 14500.18s]  I'm assuming that's scorpions and stuff.
[14500.90s -> 14507.44s]  I think I'm going to make two of these.
[14508.16s -> 14520.18s]  Yeah, I'm going to get a full 100% longer.
[14520.98s -> 14522.42s]  But I have to start doing perfect dodges, though.
[14522.42s -> 14526.60s]  Otherwise, it's not worth it.
[14526.60s -> 14527.72s]  You had pizza yesterday?
[14527.72s -> 14528.28s]  Yeah, it was good.
[14531.33s -> 14536.77s]  I had a barbecue chicken, bacon, garlic, vinegar, and oat milk pizza.
[14536.77s -> 14540.52s]  That's pretty good.
[14541.16s -> 14541.83s]  All right.
[14541.83s -> 14542.71s]  I want to know, what's this?
[14542.71s -> 14548.60s]  Well, your health is 80% higher.
[14549.32s -> 14552.77s]  All right, so this is just 20% more damage.
[14557.32s -> 14558.52s]  Okay, we're going to get rid of two of these.
[14559.16s -> 14565.27s]  So now I do 10% more damage.
[14566.08s -> 14569.92s]  Or technically like 18% less damage than I was doing before.
[14570.56s -> 14574.42s]  But the slow time function is like forever.
[14575.06s -> 14577.19s]  Let's try it.
[14577.83s -> 14579.83s]  See how it seems any good.
[14579.83s -> 14587.27s]  We combined all of our sleeper agent words.
[14587.99s -> 14592.04s]  Yeah, that's funny.
[14595.91s -> 14597.19s]  I'm going to eat one of those things, too.
[14597.83s -> 14598.96s]  Because why not?
[14599.52s -> 14603.49s]  I'm ready to move.
[14603.49s -> 14604.61s]  Let's do this boss fight.
[14605.41s -> 14606.37s]  It is time.
[14607.01s -> 14609.00s]  It is time.
[14609.00s -> 14609.89s]  But not yet.
[14609.89s -> 14615.25s]  Let's check on Shinobu.
[14615.25s -> 14618.84s]  I can still fight, but even in your nightmares, you're fighting.
[14618.84s -> 14619.96s]  You're a real beast.
[14620.44s -> 14623.64s]  Speaking of beasts, Akuto's Northern Lights Bomb.
[14624.28s -> 14625.24s]  That move is risky.
[14625.24s -> 14626.28s]  It really tests your skill.
[14627.17s -> 14630.61s]  Shinobu, are you ready to drop a Northern Lights Bomb?
[14630.61s -> 14632.13s]  The Northern Lights Bomb awaits you.
[14632.69s -> 14635.89s]  What's wrong with me?
[14643.65s -> 14644.53s]  All right, let's just do it.
[14645.09s -> 14645.65s]  I'm ready to go.
[14646.21s -> 14651.43s]  I also can go back to the time machine and fight other bosses and make them harder.
[14651.43s -> 14654.00s]  I haven't done it all.
[14654.00s -> 14659.68s]  I have to pee again, but I'm going to hold it until after the boss.
[14659.68s -> 14661.44s]  If that makes sense to me.
[14661.44s -> 14663.04s]  Or should I go right before the boss?
[14663.04s -> 14664.93s]  What do you think?
[14664.93s -> 14666.61s]  One's in chat if I should go before the boss.
[14667.09s -> 14677.36s]  All right, I'll be right back.
[14678.24s -> 14680.08s]  This is probably the last break of the night.
[14680.08s -> 14682.63s]  I'll probably go for like another hour, hour and a half or so.
[14682.63s -> 14683.91s]  We'll see.
[14683.91s -> 14684.63s]  I'll be right back.
[14684.63s -> 14878.00s]  What's happening?
[14878.00s -> 14881.46s]  Oh, there we go.
[14881.46s -> 14882.20s]  Okay.
[14882.20s -> 14892.48s]  What's with the smile?
[14893.04s -> 14893.68s]  What's with the smile?
[14894.24s -> 14899.03s]  What's with the smiling?
[14899.03s -> 14905.00s]  Don't worry about it.
[14905.00s -> 14905.50s]  Okay.
[14905.96s -> 14908.24s]  If you tell me not to worry about it, I'm not going to worry about it.
[14908.24s -> 14910.56s]  Why would I worry about something I'm told just to not worry about?
[14917.20s -> 14918.24s]  Let's do the boss.
[14918.80s -> 14932.15s]  Here we go.
[14932.15s -> 14933.59s]  Garden of Insanity.
[14934.39s -> 14942.39s]  The number five ranked assassin is Midori Midorikawa.
[14943.03s -> 14946.55s]  Occupation Dark World Princess.
[14946.55s -> 14952.60s]  Even the UAA Internashk does not know exactly who she is.
[14953.80s -> 14955.72s]  Get all your yayas out Travis.
[14956.44s -> 14959.48s]  Welcome to the Garden of Insanity.
[14960.20s -> 14961.24s]  I wonder what they're going to do.
[14961.24s -> 14963.48s]  I have no idea what this game is going to throw at us now.
[14963.48s -> 14969.97s]  Because I think there's only really been two or three real boss fights the whole game.
[14970.93s -> 14976.56s]  There's been maybe three you fight the boss games.
[14977.44s -> 14980.20s]  The rest have just been insanity.
[14981.00s -> 14982.76s]  Mini games inside of the rooms.
[14982.76s -> 14983.72s]  People killing each other.
[14983.72s -> 14985.00s]  Somebody teaching me moves.
[14985.72s -> 14987.56s]  I wonder what this is going to be.
[14988.36s -> 14995.56s]  All right.
[14995.56s -> 14996.44s]  Let's go with this one.
[14999.17s -> 15000.93s]  Greatly increased health attack by our intention.
[15000.93s -> 15001.41s]  Let's do it.
[15001.97s -> 15002.69s]  I mean, why not?
[15002.69s -> 15003.81s]  If you have the money, just use it.
[15007.48s -> 15008.92s]  And we just musical chairs.
[15008.92s -> 15020.02s]  All right.
[15021.28s -> 15022.32s]  I got five heels.
[15022.32s -> 15022.80s]  I'm good.
[15024.12s -> 15024.68s]  David.
[15024.68s -> 15034.52s]  He's fall asleep in the toilet.
[15034.52s -> 15044.04s]  The sushi looks good.
[15045.51s -> 15046.31s]  Yeah, it does.
[15047.03s -> 15050.71s]  Somebody said a tuna fish and I don't want it.
[15051.60s -> 15055.04s]  I want like a nice big cheesy tuna melt.
[15055.04s -> 15058.74s]  With just like a bunch of pickles on the side.
[15064.00s -> 15065.36s]  Damn, that sounds good.
[15065.36s -> 15067.38s]  That's the game plan after this.
[15071.78s -> 15072.90s]  Like a side salad.
[15073.54s -> 15074.34s]  Carrots and shit.
[15075.62s -> 15075.86s]  Yeah.
[15076.42s -> 15081.25s]  Where the hell are we?
[15081.25s -> 15081.81s]  At school.
[15082.45s -> 15084.13s]  A Japanese school, huh?
[15084.13s -> 15087.97s]  I've seen places like this in Miyake's movies about delinquents and stuff.
[15088.87s -> 15091.19s]  This place is kind of scary.
[15091.19s -> 15093.99s]  Yeah, like one missed call scary.
[15097.46s -> 15097.94s]  Scary.
[15100.88s -> 15101.52s]  Oh, God.
[15102.56s -> 15103.84s]  Something feels off here.
[15104.40s -> 15106.56s]  Yeah, super off.
[15106.56s -> 15108.55s]  Is this?
[15108.55s -> 15111.03s]  I'm probably going to have to run away from a scary monster thing.
[15111.03s -> 15112.47s]  My name is Midori Midorikawa.
[15112.47s -> 15117.19s]  Bill's sister's name is Do-Re-Mi Midori.
[15117.19s -> 15119.51s]  It's spelled like notes and pronounced Do-Re-Mi.
[15119.67s -> 15122.93s]  Those weird names people give their kids these days.
[15122.93s -> 15125.17s]  My house is near Midori Yama Studio.
[15125.17s -> 15128.85s]  During my rebellious period, I wore lots of Kimidori green.
[15128.85s -> 15132.45s]  I was disappointed in myself for not wearing my favorite color, red.
[15132.45s -> 15136.37s]  I've been cursed by green, which is Midori in Japanese.
[15136.37s -> 15140.53s]  There are so many things I hate about it and I almost totally blamed my parents,
[15140.53s -> 15144.45s]  but I just couldn't hold them accountable because I love mommy and daddy.
[15144.45s -> 15146.77s]  There was someone else I loved even more.
[15146.77s -> 15148.93s]  He led me down this path to becoming a cleaner.
[15149.41s -> 15150.69s]  What sort of path, you ask?
[15151.41s -> 15153.01s]  Where do I even start?
[15153.01s -> 15156.77s]  Time and space have been distorted, so I can't really get things straight.
[15157.33s -> 15159.65s]  But for starters, I'm going to kill you.
[15159.65s -> 15161.57s]  So I'd appreciate your cooperation.
[15162.45s -> 15163.17s]  I would run.
[15163.17s -> 15164.37s]  She disappeared.
[15164.37s -> 15164.93s]  Where is she?
[15165.57s -> 15166.85s]  I don't care how skilled I am.
[15166.85s -> 15167.33s]  I'm going to run.
[15168.53s -> 15178.36s]  I'll just call the nuking.
[15178.36s -> 15178.76s]  You know what I mean?
[15178.76s -> 15180.12s]  I'll just send a nuke.
[15180.12s -> 15181.03s]  I'm going to run.
[15181.75s -> 15182.79s]  I'm going to try to get out.
[15182.79s -> 15188.13s]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[15191.48s -> 15192.84s]  It's first person.
[15193.48s -> 15196.77s]  They really just said, fuck it.
[15196.77s -> 15198.21s]  They don't even give a shit.
[15198.21s -> 15199.25s]  They just said, fuck it.
[15199.25s -> 15200.29s]  We're going to do whatever we want.
[15200.85s -> 15205.09s]  Each one of these bosses has been like a weird, almost like tropey thing.
[15206.29s -> 15209.17s]  I love it, but they just said, fuck it, huh?
[15209.81s -> 15211.83s]  It's now a scary game.
[15211.83s -> 15217.75s]  It's going to be a jump scare.
[15217.75s -> 15218.39s]  There has to be.
[15218.95s -> 15220.76s]  You don't make this without a jump scare.
[15228.93s -> 15231.01s]  It kind of feels like I'm in Gary's Mod right now.
[15231.65s -> 15233.49s]  What does that mean?
[15234.13s -> 15239.28s]  We need a face cam.
[15239.28s -> 15239.92s]  I don't have a T.
[15239.92s -> 15240.80s]  I don't have clothes on.
[15241.44s -> 15244.26s]  Oh, God.
[15244.26s -> 15244.98s]  Okay, fine.
[15245.22s -> 15246.10s]  I got to put a T-shirt on.
[15246.10s -> 15246.58s]  Give me a second.
[15247.30s -> 15248.66s]  I'll give you two seconds.
[15280.31s -> 15281.83s]  Okay, I got a bathrobe.
[15281.83s -> 15283.51s]  That's the closest thing I could grab.
[15284.15s -> 15306.04s]  I got a bathrobe.
[15306.04s -> 15317.78s]  All right, that looks good.
[15317.78s -> 15318.34s]  Here we go.
[15318.34s -> 15325.72s]  Turn off the lights?
[15325.72s -> 15326.20s]  No.
[15326.20s -> 15343.86s]  It's going to turn around.
[15343.86s -> 15350.98s]  It's going to scream.
[15350.98s -> 15356.29s]  No?
[15356.29s -> 15362.15s]  And we're certain that Suda51 didn't have seven or eight games in development
[15362.15s -> 15365.27s]  and just mushed them all together and made No More Heroes 3.
[15365.27s -> 15365.67s]  Are you sure?
[15365.67s -> 15366.71s]  Are we certain about that?
[15366.71s -> 15381.08s]  I feel like these are all just like EXEs he had on his desktop.
[15381.48s -> 15383.64s]  He was just like, yeah, I'm going to try to make like a little horror game.
[15383.64s -> 15388.02s]  And he's got like 40 EXEs on his desktop of games that he made
[15388.76s -> 15391.64s]  with a group of friends and his teammates.
[15391.64s -> 15393.46s]  And then it's like, yeah, fuck it.
[15393.46s -> 15394.50s]  Let's just put that No More Heroes.
[15394.50s -> 15395.22s]  Why not?
[15395.22s -> 15410.34s]  We're good.
[15416.52s -> 15417.32s]  Mustang mode.
[15417.96s -> 15430.07s]  I will back to first person in each series.
[15430.07s -> 15444.64s]  A 20K robe?
[15444.64s -> 15446.24s]  I think this is from Target.
[15446.24s -> 15468.13s]  What happened?
[15468.13s -> 15468.85s]  Blood.
[15468.85s -> 15481.18s]  Okay.
[15481.88s -> 15484.68s]  This is getting more and more bad and scary.
[15484.68s -> 15488.13s]  It's going to come out.
[15488.13s -> 15489.65s]  She's going to be screaming, coming out.
[15489.65s -> 15490.61s]  I'm going to turn around and run.
[15490.61s -> 15502.47s]  Left or right?
[15502.47s -> 15504.55s]  That doesn't open.
[15504.55s -> 15504.79s]  All right.
[15504.79s -> 15507.54s]  I'm going to say right is a shorter hallway.
[15507.54s -> 15508.50s]  So I'm going to go right.
[15508.50s -> 15518.52s]  Return to the motel?
[15518.52s -> 15522.90s]  Return to the motel?
[15523.46s -> 15527.76s]  What the hell is this?
[15527.76s -> 15532.24s]  It's a way out way.
[15532.24s -> 15533.92s]  It's the midway point in the haunted house
[15533.92s -> 15536.16s]  so the little kids can leave when they're really scared.
[15536.16s -> 15538.90s]  Okay.
[15538.90s -> 15543.06s]  You know, like fucking Darth Vader is holding the door open
[15543.06s -> 15545.25s]  for the parents to take their kids out.
[15545.25s -> 15546.53s]  It's like, oh, thank you, Darth Vader.
[15546.53s -> 15547.09s]  He lets you out.
[15547.09s -> 15547.65s]  You go out.
[15547.65s -> 15550.95s]  You don't go to the scary, awful part.
[15550.95s -> 15553.75s]  Like they wave, like two or three of them wave as you leave.
[15553.75s -> 15556.61s]  I remember that.
[15556.61s -> 15558.85s]  They try to keep you from the really scary shit.
[15558.85s -> 15575.11s]  Unlocked of memory.
[15575.11s -> 15576.23s]  Old joke, Andy.
[15576.23s -> 15577.83s]  No, I can make reference.
[15577.83s -> 15579.51s]  Reference is an old joke.
[15580.23s -> 15582.31s]  You're referencing something that happened before.
[15583.35s -> 15585.67s]  So I can reference a thing that I'm referencing
[15585.67s -> 15587.35s]  because it's old and I'm referencing it.
[15602.48s -> 15602.96s]  Two, two.
[15602.96s -> 15603.12s]  All right.
[15603.12s -> 15605.52s]  Remember these numbers up here.
[15605.52s -> 15606.48s]  Salty Andy.
[15607.04s -> 15608.96s]  Somebody flashlight in there.
[15610.40s -> 15610.96s]  That's a mirror.
[15610.96s -> 15611.76s]  Never mind.
[15611.76s -> 15616.80s]  I did that on purpose.
[15616.80s -> 15618.08s]  Haha, that was funny.
[15618.08s -> 15622.40s]  I have this blood in here.
[15632.42s -> 15634.02s]  I hope this part goes on for an hour.
[15636.36s -> 15637.00s]  Death bro.
[15637.00s -> 15641.06s]  Strong it.
[15641.06s -> 15644.79s]  Right on.
[15644.79s -> 15645.43s]  Dodge.
[15645.43s -> 15646.96s]  You're never gonna catch.
[15646.96s -> 15648.68s]  Watch this shirt.
[15650.04s -> 15650.76s]  Get some.
[15672.88s -> 15675.28s]  I feel like I just have like a lit cigarette.
[15675.28s -> 15677.60s]  Just in an ashtray right here that you can see.
[15678.16s -> 15680.58s]  I don't smoke it once.
[15680.58s -> 15682.31s]  It's just there.
[15682.31s -> 15685.49s]  Just lit for an hour.
[15685.49s -> 15688.96s]  I have to clear all these rooms.
[15688.96s -> 15689.68s]  Is that what's going on?
[15690.24s -> 15695.24s]  Or is it just the ones with blood?
[15695.80s -> 15703.19s]  Definitely all the rooms with blood.
[15703.19s -> 15703.91s]  Absolutely right.
[15703.91s -> 15704.55s]  Yeah, of course.
[15711.06s -> 15712.50s]  Spin death slow.
[15715.08s -> 15717.68s]  I want to try the dodge.
[15718.88s -> 15719.60s]  Let's try dodge.
[15725.35s -> 15726.07s]  So let's see now.
[15726.07s -> 15726.79s]  How long is this guy?
[15729.99s -> 15734.36s]  I mean, I can't even tell.
[15734.36s -> 15735.96s]  I'm just killing him so hard.
[15735.96s -> 15742.23s]  Remember we can see the damaged tattoo.
[15742.87s -> 15747.57s]  What if you guys just never knew?
[15747.57s -> 15750.13s]  But I was just covered in tattoos from my hair down.
[15750.13s -> 15751.17s]  From the neck down.
[15751.17s -> 15753.32s]  You just saw like a bunch of patterns in there.
[15753.96s -> 15756.68s]  I feel like I would not.
[15756.68s -> 15757.40s]  I would have been.
[15757.40s -> 15758.92s]  You probably would have known that by now.
[15758.92s -> 15774.00s]  I see green.
[15774.80s -> 15781.65s]  Oh shit, no.
[15782.37s -> 15784.47s]  So where do I go?
[15784.47s -> 15785.19s]  Wait, what happened?
[15794.40s -> 15797.88s]  Hey, it's putting me at the end of the hallway.
[15797.88s -> 15799.16s]  Oh, that's what's going on.
[15799.16s -> 15799.88s]  It's put me at the...
[15800.44s -> 15805.97s]  Okay, this is just putting me
[15806.61s -> 15808.61s]  at the end of the hallway when I do that.
[15808.61s -> 15810.21s]  So all right, let's fight then.
[15811.01s -> 15814.34s]  Okay, I gotta clear the rooms.
[15814.34s -> 15817.30s]  Put a tattoo of yourself.
[15819.17s -> 15819.73s]  Hey, come on.
[15819.73s -> 15820.45s]  Reference Andy.
[15820.45s -> 15820.77s]  Come on.
[15821.73s -> 15823.33s]  I made the joke like three years ago
[15823.33s -> 15826.53s]  that I was going to get a tattoo of my face on my face.
[15826.53s -> 15827.09s]  Full scale.
[15841.65s -> 15847.86s]  I think that's it.
[15848.74s -> 15850.24s]  Maybe one more room.
[15850.96s -> 15855.84s]  Get a tattoo of the sus face on your face.
[15856.48s -> 15873.22s]  What is this?
[15873.22s -> 15873.70s]  Disco.
[15874.74s -> 15875.78s]  Somebody started a disco?
[15876.58s -> 15877.30s]  That was like a big thing.
[15877.30s -> 15878.82s]  It was a disco in the chat or something.
[15878.82s -> 15879.22s]  What was that?
[15879.94s -> 15891.73s]  Then what am I supposed to do?
[15892.37s -> 15894.16s]  So I just leave?
[15894.88s -> 15898.50s]  Oh, it's open.
[15898.50s -> 15899.46s]  Okay, it's open.
[15899.46s -> 15910.85s]  I think the face cam was on so you could see that.
[15910.85s -> 15917.00s]  Okay, I think you got your face cam that you wanted.
[15926.52s -> 15929.08s]  And stupid and intelligent and dumb.
[15929.72s -> 15932.28s]  But you're also a nice guy with a serious side too.
[15932.28s -> 15933.96s]  Is this chat talking to me?
[15934.60s -> 15937.96s]  There's a certain type of guy that reminds me of my old boyfriend.
[15937.96s -> 15940.52s]  Something happened and we ended up breaking up.
[15940.52s -> 15942.84s]  But the reason for that was actually pretty funny.
[15942.84s -> 15943.72s]  Want to hear about it?
[15945.08s -> 15946.84s]  No, I'm not really in the mood.
[15948.24s -> 15950.80s]  Oh, it's about time we finished settling this.
[15951.60s -> 15953.84s]  All right, then let's go up to the roof.
[15953.84s -> 15954.80s]  Jump with me, okay?
[15954.80s -> 15956.08s]  I kind of hope it's still first person.
[15956.08s -> 15957.28s]  Seems quickest.
[15957.28s -> 15960.24s]  One, two, three.
[15960.24s -> 15963.65s]  Huh?
[15963.65s -> 15965.67s]  I messed up.
[15965.67s -> 15966.07s]  This is-
[15966.07s -> 15970.95s]  This is that rock quarry in Ibaraki that they use to film those tokusatsu shows, isn't it?
[15971.59s -> 15972.07s]  Awesome.
[15972.71s -> 15974.31s]  I can't believe I'm here.
[15974.31s -> 15977.19s]  This is where they film common writer zeal, you know?
[15977.19s -> 15978.87s]  Oh, sorry.
[15978.87s -> 15981.75s]  I kind of can't deal with all this otaku talk.
[15981.75s -> 15982.63s]  So could you not?
[15983.43s -> 15985.03s]  Fine, whatever.
[15985.03s -> 15986.63s]  All right, so we're actually gonna fight.
[15989.84s -> 15990.16s]  Okay.
[15990.80s -> 15992.16s]  Is that a mouth on her hand?
[15992.16s -> 15992.88s]  It's morning.
[15999.56s -> 16000.28s]  Holy shit.
[16003.22s -> 16010.39s]  Listen, this scary old man is standing right there.
[16011.11s -> 16012.55s]  Let's kill him together.
[16013.43s -> 16014.71s]  He's pretty tough.
[16014.71s -> 16015.67s]  I might even die.
[16015.67s -> 16016.23s]  Oh my god.
[16016.23s -> 16017.67s]  No, don't die.
[16017.67s -> 16024.92s]  Nice.
[16024.92s -> 16026.76s]  Changing forms like that and all?
[16026.76s -> 16029.24s]  You must really love the tokusatsu stuff.
[16029.96s -> 16033.96s]  Once these guys wake up, it's all over, Travis.
[16033.96s -> 16034.68s]  Whatever.
[16034.68s -> 16036.28s]  I'll kill all your asses.
[16036.28s -> 16038.12s]  I gotta change up forms, too.
[16038.12s -> 16040.04s]  Otherwise, it would be rude.
[16044.88s -> 16045.20s]  Really?
[16045.20s -> 16046.00s]  Is this a suit fight?
[16046.00s -> 16047.04s]  This is a suit fight?
[16047.92s -> 16051.16s]  We're going into space?
[16065.57s -> 16069.60s]  I'm gonna have nightmares about this.
[16069.60s -> 16070.16s]  I really will.
[16075.20s -> 16078.00s]  Are they like wallet warrior laughing at me?
[16080.39s -> 16080.71s]  Okay.
[16082.87s -> 16084.07s]  Like nice skin.
[16084.07s -> 16084.39s]  Okay.
[16086.18s -> 16087.94s]  Press R to launch a tiger attack.
[16088.58s -> 16090.42s]  Press L to fire your multi-missile.
[16092.64s -> 16094.00s]  Tiger attack multi-missile.
[16094.72s -> 16097.84s]  It's also called full green mode.
[16097.84s -> 16099.60s]  These are both extremely powerful attacks,
[16099.60s -> 16101.84s]  so they'll need time to cool down after use.
[16101.84s -> 16103.60s]  Watch out for the right time to unleash them.
[16104.24s -> 16105.60s]  Do I have a regular attack?
[16109.75s -> 16110.63s]  I have regular attacks.
[16117.14s -> 16118.02s]  This is ridiculous.
[16118.66s -> 16123.00s]  So when should I use this?
[16123.72s -> 16124.87s]  I'm gonna use it now.
[16125.51s -> 16127.01s]  I can't do it.
[16127.01s -> 16127.89s]  I just tried to do it.
[16127.89s -> 16128.53s]  Oh, wrong button.
[16140.80s -> 16141.76s]  Get the fuck out.
[16146.58s -> 16147.86s]  I just point blanked.
[16148.74s -> 16157.68s]  Don't stand in the fire.
[16158.40s -> 16163.72s]  Oh, you guys get to see my APM down there.
[16164.52s -> 16165.16s]  How am I doing?
[16165.80s -> 16180.28s]  Ow.
[16180.28s -> 16186.04s]  Almost phase one.
[16193.25s -> 16195.25s]  Of course, we get a pew, pew, pew.
[16195.25s -> 16195.97s]  All right, phase two.
[16195.97s -> 16196.37s]  Now what?
[16217.30s -> 16218.02s]  I'm fine.
[16218.02s -> 16221.62s]  This is pretty easy.
[16222.26s -> 16223.32s]  This one's not.
[16223.32s -> 16223.96s]  This one's pretty easy.
[16224.92s -> 16226.10s]  Let's just kill her.
[16231.27s -> 16236.80s]  That was a cool fight.
[16236.80s -> 16237.44s]  Just a cool character.
[16237.44s -> 16255.43s]  But I mean, I just absolutely dunked on you.
[16255.43s -> 16258.87s]  Dory, Dory, Dory lose.
[16259.75s -> 16263.84s]  That's to be a little easier since you can't use your healing items.
[16263.84s -> 16265.20s]  Oh, I guess I meant to say it makes sense.
[16274.34s -> 16276.26s]  That was more of an experience than it was a rough fight.
[16306.72s -> 16308.48s]  Oh, is this a real boss fight?
[16309.62s -> 16311.44s]  Who the hell are?
[16311.44s -> 16312.64s]  Trav, it's me.
[16313.52s -> 16315.84s]  Kamui, is that you?
[16315.84s -> 16316.56s]  Not this one.
[16316.56s -> 16317.68s]  Another fake out.
[16317.68s -> 16318.88s]  Stay out of this.
[16318.88s -> 16319.84s]  That's my girlfriend.
[16320.56s -> 16321.92s]  Seriously?
[16321.92s -> 16323.60s]  This is your girlfriend?
[16323.60s -> 16324.80s]  We've got no beef with you.
[16325.52s -> 16329.84s]  We just sort of took full upon his offer and thought of it kind of like going to a nice barbecue,
[16329.84s -> 16330.64s]  you know?
[16330.64s -> 16332.80s]  Like that thing that's really trendy these days.
[16332.80s -> 16334.32s]  Dompering or whatever.
[16334.88s -> 16336.96s]  That was basically what we envisioned coming here.
[16337.52s -> 16338.48s]  Are you for real?
[16339.20s -> 16341.76s]  I've never actually met Fu.
[16341.76s -> 16345.52s]  During the breakout, I made eye contact with him for like a second.
[16345.52s -> 16347.92s]  And I could feel the dark world in those eyes.
[16348.88s -> 16349.60s]  Oh, yeah.
[16349.60s -> 16352.08s]  By the way, I'm a dark world princess.
[16352.08s -> 16355.76s]  And that's right, Dory is an actual princess.
[16355.76s -> 16356.64s]  Isn't that awesome?
[16357.68s -> 16358.08s]  Okay.
[16358.64s -> 16362.08s]  So I kind of got no idea what's going on right now.
[16362.08s -> 16363.04s]  Travis strikes again.
[16363.04s -> 16364.40s]  Skipper left in the dark.
[16364.40s -> 16368.00s]  Omega low.
[16368.00s -> 16368.72s]  Thanks, Trav.
[16368.72s -> 16371.17s]  I return the favor.
[16371.17s -> 16373.33s]  Come on over and hang out sometime.
[16373.33s -> 16374.37s]  That's good enough for me.
[16374.93s -> 16377.57s]  Trav, you really are a good guy.
[16378.37s -> 16379.89s]  I've been too good of a guy, really.
[16384.76s -> 16387.56s]  So then, what do you all think about this?
[16388.60s -> 16393.40s]  This boss fight, it had become quite the confusing mess.
[16393.40s -> 16397.48s]  But somewhere inside that confusing mess hid the truth.
[16398.76s -> 16399.48s]  What is real?
[16400.20s -> 16400.84s]  What is not?
[16401.56s -> 16402.84s]  We were just talking about this.
[16402.84s -> 16404.20s]  Questions for the ages.
[16405.16s -> 16407.48s]  There is only one thing that is real.
[16408.56s -> 16411.20s]  I am here in front of your very eyes.
[16412.00s -> 16415.04s]  After crossing the river of life and death,
[16416.21s -> 16418.93s]  find the place where the point and the line
[16418.93s -> 16420.69s]  of everyday life intersect.
[16421.41s -> 16422.98s]  Be waiting for you.
[16422.98s -> 16424.10s]  Is this the streamer?
[16424.66s -> 16426.45s]  Kill the life.
[16426.45s -> 16427.97s]  Destroy the life.
[16427.97s -> 16428.69s]  Kill the boy.
[16428.69s -> 16429.65s]  Erase the life.
[16429.65s -> 16430.53s]  And let the man be born.
[16430.53s -> 16433.09s]  Once it's all gone, it's all over.
[16433.09s -> 16434.53s]  And then have everyone forget.
[16434.93s -> 16436.55s]  It's not actually over yet.
[16436.55s -> 16437.59s]  Because it was so awful.
[16437.59s -> 16440.04s]  The true end is killing the past.
[16440.04s -> 16442.76s]  No one even remembers this entire series.
[16442.76s -> 16443.56s]  John.
[16443.56s -> 16453.57s]  Kill the past.
[16454.21s -> 16458.82s]  Yeah, that was...
[16458.82s -> 16460.02s]  Okay, that was weird.
[16460.02s -> 16465.64s]  Kill the boy.
[16466.28s -> 16467.75s]  Kill the boy.
[16467.75s -> 16474.93s]  What a peculiar...
[16477.20s -> 16480.00s]  Congratulations, Travis.
[16480.88s -> 16485.12s]  You have been recognized as number five in the galactic rankings.
[16485.12s -> 16486.96s]  I feel like I'm at a Suda 51 convention,
[16486.96s -> 16488.00s]  and I don't even know I'm there.
[16492.26s -> 16494.10s]  He's just referencing every game he's ever made.
[16501.03s -> 16502.47s]  Okay, we're now number four.
[16504.13s -> 16505.01s]  We're number five now.
[16505.01s -> 16506.21s]  We're going for number four.
[16506.21s -> 16514.42s]  Let's go for the next one.
[16514.42s -> 16515.30s]  We'll do another one.
[16515.30s -> 16527.19s]  Yeah, I feel like going for the...
[16527.83s -> 16529.99s]  Being number four means that we have three more to do.
[16532.96s -> 16534.66s]  That's probably not enough for a whole stream, though.
[16537.73s -> 16538.23s]  So...
[16540.98s -> 16542.98s]  Okay, so I'm going to play WarioWare on Friday.
[16543.70s -> 16544.26s]  We're not done.
[16544.26s -> 16544.74s]  I'm not...
[16544.74s -> 16545.38s]  I'm still here.
[16545.38s -> 16546.42s]  I'm going to stream for like an hour.
[16548.02s -> 16550.37s]  WarioWare is going to be Friday.
[16550.93s -> 16552.45s]  And then Wario...
[16552.45s -> 16553.09s]  I might even play...
[16553.65s -> 16554.93s]  I'll play this on Saturday.
[16555.57s -> 16558.32s]  And then depending on how long this takes to finish it,
[16558.96s -> 16564.95s]  because I feel like there's probably still another four and a half,
[16564.95s -> 16566.47s]  maybe four to five hours left in the game.
[16567.27s -> 16575.17s]  There's also the time machine to do the bosses on higher difficulties.
[16575.17s -> 16575.97s]  That's true, yeah.
[16575.97s -> 16577.73s]  So there's still plenty of content to do for a whole stream.
[16578.53s -> 16583.08s]  So we'll go for one more,
[16583.08s -> 16585.49s]  and then I'll finish this up on Saturday.
[16585.49s -> 16587.60s]  And then we'll do WarioWare on Friday.
[16589.44s -> 16592.45s]  And we'll do one more.
[16592.45s -> 16597.75s]  Get us towards heading to the top three.
[16597.75s -> 16609.91s]  And then it's tuna melt time.
[16610.47s -> 16615.14s]  What if you get struck by lightning before then?
[16616.58s -> 16619.38s]  I've already lived like 200 lifetimes.
[16619.94s -> 16621.14s]  So I don't care.
[16653.56s -> 16656.44s]  I guess humans are pretty tough after all.
[16656.44s -> 16657.96s]  Yeah, they're not weak.
[16657.96s -> 16659.56s]  What's a big Hero 6 guy?
[16659.56s -> 16660.76s]  So how are things now?
[16660.76s -> 16661.48s]  What's his name?
[16662.92s -> 16665.48s]  This guy is really something.
[16665.48s -> 16667.80s]  The assassin called Travis.
[16667.80s -> 16668.30s]  Baymax.
[16668.84s -> 16672.04s]  Just give me the word and I'll go kill him straight away.
[16672.04s -> 16674.20s]  What if a little kid drew Baymax?
[16674.20s -> 16676.20s]  Because Baymax is their favorite character.
[16676.20s -> 16677.80s]  And then they just put it to a 3D renderer.
[16678.68s -> 16679.64s]  What's he thinking?
[16680.28s -> 16682.72s]  I just want you to kill him.
[16684.12s -> 16685.56s]  By the way, I love this character's design.
[16685.56s -> 16686.60s]  I think it's amazing.
[16686.60s -> 16687.80s]  There was not a dog at the design.
[16688.68s -> 16689.96s]  It was just kind of an observation.
[16690.60s -> 16700.90s]  Who are these two?
[16701.46s -> 16706.71s]  Ah, big four have gathered.
[16707.27s -> 16710.63s]  Or to put it a different way, only the big four survived.
[16710.63s -> 16711.75s]  WWE 2K20.
[16711.75s -> 16714.07s]  I'll wait patiently.
[16714.07s -> 16717.11s]  Could this human even make it all the way to me?
[16717.11s -> 16718.07s]  It's fucking crazy.
[16718.07s -> 16719.19s]  I'm not worried.
[16719.19s -> 16721.75s]  Sniping Lee here will put this earthling down.
[16722.55s -> 16724.79s]  That's what everyone says before they get killed.
[16725.59s -> 16727.03s]  You're probably going to die too.
[16727.99s -> 16728.63s]  Prince fool.
[16729.27s -> 16730.63s]  Can I kill this guy?
[16731.19s -> 16732.63s]  Take him out with a headshot.
[16733.51s -> 16734.79s]  Xavier Renegade Angel.
[16734.79s -> 16735.35s]  Yeah, it is.
[16735.35s -> 16737.06s]  Damon.
[16737.06s -> 16740.28s]  Those are some pretty big words there, huh?
[16740.28s -> 16741.48s]  It's the truth, foo.
[16741.48s -> 16743.16s]  I just want that guy killed.
[16743.16s -> 16744.76s]  I want to see him torn to shreds.
[16746.69s -> 16748.21s]  Jump Force create a character.
[16748.21s -> 16750.37s]  Yeah, Soul Calibur create a character.
[16750.37s -> 16750.93s]  It's for me.
[16751.89s -> 16753.33s]  Keep your opinions to yourself.
[16754.13s -> 16754.63s]  Fine.
[16755.17s -> 16756.53s]  I'll kill him my own way.
[16757.09s -> 16758.77s]  Don't you fucking get in mine.
[16759.41s -> 16762.37s]  Hurry up and take this guy out so I don't get in your way, big fool.
[16762.37s -> 16764.45s]  It's so funny how intentional that is, though.
[16768.85s -> 16769.73s]  It's so charming.
[16769.73s -> 16770.45s]  I love it.
[16770.45s -> 16771.49s]  This is stupid.
[16771.49s -> 16772.93s]  I'm going to take a nap and wait.
[16773.89s -> 16775.33s]  Don't get killed in your sleep.
[16776.29s -> 16777.89s]  I'll take your head first.
[16778.69s -> 16788.76s]  These guys don't look very powerful at all.
[16789.56s -> 16795.27s]  That's number two, number three, and number one there.
[16795.99s -> 16809.06s]  That's so funny.
[16819.08s -> 16820.36s]  They look like such jobbers.
[16821.24s -> 16824.98s]  I remember the E3 trailer being like, holy shit, look at those guys.
[16824.98s -> 16825.86s]  They look crazy.
[16827.22s -> 16830.26s]  When there's no lighting effects and they're just standing around.
[16831.30s -> 16836.44s]  Yeah, it's like, yeah, you kind of do look like a bootleg action figure.
[16851.49s -> 16854.95s]  They're so humble, Kamui.
[16854.95s -> 16857.12s]  Oh shit, this scene is awesome.
[16857.68s -> 16858.16s]  Really?
[16858.16s -> 16860.02s]  Creepy.
[16860.02s -> 16862.72s]  Man, Kakihara is so cool.
[16863.60s -> 16866.08s]  For reals, Kakihara is the shit.
[16866.72s -> 16868.16s]  Asano is kicking ass, too.
[16869.12s -> 16870.72s]  He's totally losing his shit.
[16871.44s -> 16875.12s]  Actually, I don't really care for Japanese movies.
[16875.68s -> 16877.04s]  Even though you're Japanese?
[16878.40s -> 16881.20s]  Yeah, but still, I just don't like them much.
[16881.20s -> 16883.76s]  I guess I kind of like the serialized dramas a bit more.
[16884.96s -> 16885.92s]  Okay, then.
[16885.92s -> 16888.24s]  How about the Girls X Heroines series?
[16888.96s -> 16889.83s]  What's that?
[16890.87s -> 16892.39s]  I recommend Maji Majo.
[16893.35s -> 16895.35s]  Can't go wrong with Maji Majo.
[16895.35s -> 16896.95s]  It even beats Bizarre Jelly.
[16897.67s -> 16901.27s]  No, I mean like Aibo, Tokyo Detective Duo and stuff.
[16901.83s -> 16902.39s]  Aibo?
[16903.19s -> 16907.35s]  You mean the Aibo where Miike guest starred in season 10, episode 16?
[16907.91s -> 16909.59s]  You've got good taste.
[16909.59s -> 16912.63s]  I only have season 10, episode 16.
[16912.63s -> 16914.23s]  But let's watch it together, you guys.
[16915.11s -> 16916.07s]  Want something to drink?
[16916.79s -> 16918.47s]  Okay, I'll take a mango cola.
[16920.05s -> 16920.77s]  Nice.
[16920.77s -> 16921.57s]  I'll have one, too.
[16928.13s -> 16928.69s]  Oh, man.
[16930.05s -> 16932.95s]  Ooh, I got a t-shirt.
[16937.28s -> 16937.68s]  Nice.
[16938.96s -> 16939.52s]  Nice.
[16939.52s -> 16940.88s]  Let's get this out on a tray.
[16941.52s -> 16943.27s]  Let's get this out onto a tray.
[16944.72s -> 16945.68s]  Why did you say that?
[16946.48s -> 16947.36s]  What the fuck?
[16947.36s -> 16950.00s]  Why did you say that?
[16950.00s -> 16952.16s]  Now I'm gonna only think about that for the next two hours.
[16963.22s -> 16963.70s]  I can't.
[16964.90s -> 16965.40s]  Oh.
[16968.64s -> 16975.14s]  Yeah, I've probably seen every single one of his videos up until like a year or two ago.
[16975.14s -> 16976.90s]  I've seen almost every single one.
[16976.90s -> 16982.34s]  I used to listen to those videos before.
[16982.34s -> 16986.90s]  I would just put them on repeat, just go straight through them all while I was about to go sleep.
[16987.46s -> 16994.93s]  He always loves the cigarettes, right?
[16994.93s -> 16996.85s]  So I was like, oh, man, there's cigarettes in here.
[16997.49s -> 16999.19s]  These old cigarettes.
[16999.19s -> 17001.03s]  And I'd be like, oh, what kind of cigarettes?
[17001.03s -> 17009.86s]  I actually like that.
[17009.86s -> 17011.78s]  On instant coffee, yeah, the coffee, too.
[17011.78s -> 17012.90s]  It's like, is the coffee good?
[17013.99s -> 17015.19s]  You still drink it?
[17015.19s -> 17026.96s]  I want the devolver burger.
[17026.96s -> 17033.14s]  It's just my favorite color.
[17033.14s -> 17038.63s]  Sorry, if you have a shirt that has my favorite color in the world, I'm gonna wear it.
[17051.86s -> 17054.66s]  You see, the Civil War hardtack was wild.
[17054.66s -> 17055.62s]  I don't think so.
[17056.26s -> 17057.65s]  I don't remember.
[17072.02s -> 17073.62s]  Germacolor is mint toothpaste.
[17077.32s -> 17083.64s]  Yeah, just really too bad that they don't have the aqua fresh orange shower clean
[17083.64s -> 17085.56s]  shower for your mouth toothpaste anymore.
[17085.56s -> 17086.12s]  I can't find it.
[17086.12s -> 17086.76s]  I don't know where it is.
[17088.29s -> 17089.41s]  It sucks.
[17089.41s -> 17095.54s]  That's a lot of subs.
[17095.54s -> 17096.34s]  Mystic mushroom.
[17096.34s -> 17097.62s]  Thanks for the 20 community subs.
[17098.42s -> 17100.72s]  20 community subs.
[17100.72s -> 17108.48s]  Appreciate it.
[17108.48s -> 17109.60s]  20 subs.
[17109.60s -> 17110.80s]  And I have enough to do this.
[17111.96s -> 17112.46s]  Yep.
[17113.80s -> 17115.40s]  Haven't heard that reference in a while.
[17116.04s -> 17117.48s]  I think about that toothpaste all the time.
[17119.89s -> 17125.57s]  It was white and orange and an orange stripe and it had this flavor.
[17125.57s -> 17127.73s]  It was almost like a minty citrus kind of flavor.
[17128.69s -> 17131.25s]  And it just foamed up and made these insane
[17132.13s -> 17135.25s]  awesome like minty tingly foam bubbles in your mouth.
[17136.13s -> 17138.42s]  Why would they ever get rid of that?
[17138.42s -> 17139.14s]  It was awesome.
[17145.81s -> 17147.49s]  No, it wasn't like candy flavored.
[17147.49s -> 17148.05s]  It was mint.
[17148.77s -> 17150.21s]  But it was just a small hint.
[17152.23s -> 17154.55s]  Tiny hint of this kind of orange flavor.
[17155.27s -> 17158.24s]  It was too good for the plebs.
[17158.24s -> 17159.04s]  Oh, that's sad.
[17159.84s -> 17164.71s]  You didn't say community subs in the goofy voice.
[17164.71s -> 17165.11s]  Oh, sorry.
[17165.11s -> 17168.39s]  I got community subs.
[17168.39s -> 17172.63s]  Astor, I'll kill him.
[17172.63s -> 17173.75s]  Please let me kill him.
[17173.75s -> 17175.65s]  Still fighting in your dreams.
[17175.65s -> 17177.33s]  If you're going to kill someone, you got to go full on.
[17178.71s -> 17181.51s]  Tag team version of the infamously STO move.
[17181.51s -> 17186.88s]  Back when New Japan was at its peak, Hashimoto and Ogawa simply owned it.
[17186.88s -> 17189.92s]  The one tag team surpassing the fabulous Freebirds
[17189.92s -> 17192.77s]  has got to be Hashimoto and Ogawa.
[17192.77s -> 17193.25s]  Has to be.
[17198.79s -> 17199.35s]  All right, let's go.
[17200.55s -> 17203.19s]  I think I'm going to unlock the last area of the game right now.
[17203.19s -> 17206.72s]  That's how Neelix would say.
[17206.72s -> 17208.16s]  Oh, I think so.
[17208.16s -> 17208.66s]  Scrumptious.
[17210.95s -> 17212.63s]  I just made the most delicious coffee.
[17213.57s -> 17214.29s]  Scrumptious cake.
[17216.50s -> 17217.22s]  On my home planet.
[17217.86s -> 17221.52s]  Everyone used to hate me for doing that.
[17224.12s -> 17227.32s]  When I first did the Neelix impression, everyone screamed at me.
[17227.32s -> 17228.60s]  And now you all want me to do it.
[17230.93s -> 17232.05s]  Now it's what I hear.
[17232.05s -> 17233.57s]  Do the Neelix impression.
[17233.57s -> 17237.36s]  Even though when I did the Neelix impression, like two years ago,
[17237.36s -> 17239.36s]  like 3,000 people left the stream.
[17239.92s -> 17242.96s]  And I was told, I'm going to unfollow the channel if you do that again.
[17249.25s -> 17250.61s]  Lenny the person, thanks for the 10.
[17256.26s -> 17257.38s]  Go to call of battle.
[17257.38s -> 17257.86s]  Where is that?
[17258.42s -> 17264.68s]  Didn't I get some new cards?
[17264.68s -> 17265.16s]  I think I did.
[17266.42s -> 17269.73s]  Pretty sure I got a couple of cards.
[17270.37s -> 17273.44s]  Aqua Fresh, extreme clean whitening toothpaste.
[17273.44s -> 17273.84s]  It exists.
[17273.84s -> 17274.56s]  But is it orange?
[17275.81s -> 17277.81s]  And do you have to buy it on Amazon or eBay?
[17284.47s -> 17300.82s]  Didn't get any?
[17300.82s -> 17302.02s]  Secondhand toothpaste.
[17305.67s -> 17306.31s]  Say Aaron.
[17310.02s -> 17312.26s]  You guys hate something until I do it enough times
[17312.26s -> 17313.30s]  and then you want me to do it.
[17313.94s -> 17314.58s]  How about this?
[17314.58s -> 17315.94s]  I will trade you one Aaron.
[17319.04s -> 17319.96s]  How's that?
[17320.84s -> 17337.70s]  I only picked up two scorpions the whole game.
[17338.34s -> 17362.63s]  Call of battle.
[17362.63s -> 17363.35s]  So easy.
[17364.07s -> 17376.50s]  Do the sunflower joke.
[17376.50s -> 17377.54s]  Oh, I have to go back here.
[17378.50s -> 17379.78s]  All right.
[17379.78s -> 17381.22s]  Let's not spend very much time here.
[17381.86s -> 17384.10s]  Let me get the missions done.
[17398.98s -> 17400.66s]  See you spoke again.
[17400.66s -> 17401.94s]  That's good enough for me.
[17402.90s -> 17404.50s]  See you spoke again.
[17404.50s -> 17405.86s]  That's good enough for me.
[17406.74s -> 17408.26s]  See you spoke again.
[17408.26s -> 17409.62s]  That's good enough for me.
[17412.64s -> 17420.71s]  Figure out try a new one.
[17420.71s -> 17422.15s]  I figured out try a new one today.
[17422.71s -> 17424.07s]  I figured out try a new one today.
[17430.05s -> 17430.85s]  What the fuck?
[17432.18s -> 17432.66s]  Do it.
[17439.30s -> 17440.90s]  That doesn't last so much longer.
[17442.02s -> 17449.08s]  Hey, can you untry that please?
[17454.79s -> 17455.27s]  Goodness.
[17457.67s -> 17466.61s]  Oh, I got you with another one.
[17466.61s -> 17467.01s]  Didn't I?
[17467.65s -> 17474.29s]  I don't know where I am.
[17479.22s -> 17479.62s]  Do it.
[17480.56s -> 17481.76s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[17481.76s -> 17483.52s]  This camera's stuck in the goddamn wall.
[17484.64s -> 17488.85s]  I don't have any heels left.
[17504.88s -> 17505.38s]  Whoa.
[17506.26s -> 17519.30s]  Is he going to walk in it?
[17528.98s -> 17529.46s]  Oh, fuck.
[17529.46s -> 17529.70s]  Yeah.
[17529.70s -> 17530.20s]  Good night.
[17539.61s -> 17541.77s]  This fucking motherfucker just ruined everything.
[17541.77s -> 17542.33s]  Are you kidding me?
[17542.97s -> 17544.49s]  I'm in the middle of Mustang mode.
[17544.49s -> 17545.61s]  This guy hits me from behind.
[17546.89s -> 17547.69s]  Are you shitting me?
[17548.89s -> 17553.32s]  Why are you still alive?
[17553.32s -> 17554.60s]  Why are you still alive?
[17554.60s -> 17555.10s]  Why?
[17558.26s -> 17559.78s]  Full green mode standing by.
[17566.98s -> 17567.62s]  Oh, nice.
[17567.62s -> 17568.12s]  Let's go.
[17568.66s -> 17581.40s]  Why is it off?
[17583.00s -> 17583.24s]  All right.
[17583.24s -> 17584.84s]  This has been really confusing.
[17604.62s -> 17605.12s]  Okay.
[17605.98s -> 17608.42s]  What system is this on?
[17608.42s -> 17610.10s]  This is on the Nintendo Switch.
[17615.02s -> 17615.26s]  See?
[17615.26s -> 17615.58s]  Whatever.
[17615.58s -> 17616.06s]  Just skip it.
[17616.62s -> 17623.93s]  I'm still wearing this bathrobe,
[17623.93s -> 17631.11s]  but it's so uncomfortable.
[17631.11s -> 17632.07s]  Nintendo Switch.
[17637.19s -> 17639.51s]  Daniel Bryan just walked out at AEW.
[17640.31s -> 17643.08s]  What?
[17643.08s -> 17643.72s]  Are you serious?
[17644.44s -> 17645.16s]  Are you fucking with me?
[17654.12s -> 17654.76s]  Are you kidding though?
[17654.76s -> 17655.80s]  Like, is that really happening?
[17656.60s -> 17657.24s]  Holy shit.
[17657.80s -> 17671.30s]  Do you stream naked because it's a fetish?
[17671.38s -> 17674.36s]  I stream naked because it's hot in Nevada.
[17675.93s -> 17676.57s]  I'm not naked.
[17676.57s -> 17677.69s]  I just want to shit on it.
[17677.69s -> 17679.13s]  Show me good time, okay?
[17681.91s -> 17683.27s]  Spin death throw.
[17684.31s -> 17685.51s]  Death melt shower.
[17700.90s -> 17702.02s]  I take him.
[17704.50s -> 17718.68s]  Hodge.
[17725.42s -> 17727.10s]  Screw bucket death kick.
[17728.62s -> 17730.14s]  Death melt shower.
[17730.14s -> 17733.08s]  There it is.
[17733.08s -> 17733.58s]  A hundred.
[17736.68s -> 17737.18s]  Knock him out.
[17741.16s -> 17742.84s]  We get a 200 hit combo right now.
[17742.84s -> 17743.88s]  Grab him.
[17743.88s -> 17744.44s]  Grab him.
[17745.56s -> 17747.48s]  You motherfucker.
[17747.48s -> 17749.24s]  I'm actually infuriated over this one.
[17754.81s -> 17755.31s]  Fuck.
[17757.11s -> 17758.82s]  Screw bucket kick.
[17759.78s -> 17761.30s]  Spin death throw.
[17762.10s -> 17767.90s]  Hodge.
[17767.90s -> 17768.84s]  Special kill.
[17772.04s -> 17772.54s]  Get him.
[17773.72s -> 17774.76s]  150 at least.
[17776.12s -> 17779.80s]  Where am I?
[17782.12s -> 17783.00s]  God damn it.
[17783.00s -> 17784.20s]  This fucking camera.
[17788.52s -> 17800.30s]  Let me get to 200.
[17800.30s -> 17800.70s]  Come on.
[17800.70s -> 17801.26s]  Don't kill him.
[17805.43s -> 17805.93s]  200.
[17807.29s -> 17807.93s]  Let me see it.
[17808.97s -> 17809.37s]  There it is.
[17809.37s -> 17809.53s]  All right.
[17809.53s -> 17810.41s]  I got 200 to combo.
[17810.41s -> 17811.29s]  I'm fine.
[17811.29s -> 17811.79s]  I'm happy.
[17820.01s -> 17821.93s]  I get stuck in between the cars and the trucks.
[17830.78s -> 17833.34s]  I love the idea of having to reload the sword from a design perspective.
[17835.70s -> 17837.86s]  You know it was actually a lot harder in the other games.
[17838.50s -> 17841.75s]  It took a lot longer and you had to stay still.
[17842.55s -> 17844.07s]  During some boss fights it was hell.
[17845.37s -> 17850.09s]  You'd have to just sit there standing still just boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom.
[17850.09s -> 17852.17s]  Kind of like doing a whetstone in Monster Hunter.
[17852.17s -> 17856.74s]  But it took a little longer.
[17856.74s -> 17871.86s]  Will you ever stop streaming?
[17872.50s -> 17874.49s]  You mean permanently?
[17874.49s -> 17874.99s]  Eventually?
[17876.22s -> 17876.72s]  Yeah.
[17877.10s -> 17877.82s]  Probably one day.
[17878.46s -> 17881.19s]  I mean tonight.
[17881.19s -> 17882.31s]  I mean not right now.
[17882.31s -> 17883.03s]  Maybe in a little bit.
[17884.89s -> 17888.17s]  I mean we all permanently are going to stop doing stuff permanently at one point.
[17889.13s -> 17890.01s]  Change what you're doing.
[17890.57s -> 17893.35s]  Do something new.
[17893.35s -> 17893.75s]  I don't know.
[17899.03s -> 17901.75s]  I don't have any plans on when that will be.
[17901.75s -> 17903.67s]  I just know that eventually maybe it will happen.
[17905.40s -> 17906.12s]  You know I'm a human.
[17907.32s -> 17914.94s]  I kind of want to do the tank.
[17914.94s -> 17916.06s]  The alligator thing again.
[17917.42s -> 17919.58s]  I'm going to do this and then go see if I have another mission for the alligator.
[17920.62s -> 17921.90s]  That looks like it's kind of fun.
[17935.06s -> 17936.42s]  Who will you give the channel to?
[17940.10s -> 17941.70s]  I have like a son or a daughter.
[17943.42s -> 17944.86s]  Germa985 continues.
[17946.73s -> 17947.53s]  Greg Elbertson.
[17961.02s -> 17961.98s]  That was a little explodey thing.
[17980.52s -> 17981.24s]  Ooh.
[17981.24s -> 17982.20s]  Utopia coins.
[17983.40s -> 17987.72s]  Get another 100 hit combo.
[17987.72s -> 17988.22s]  I'll take it.
[17989.08s -> 17994.36s]  Do a charity auction for your channel.
[17995.40s -> 17996.12s]  I don't think so.
[17996.12s -> 17997.16s]  I don't think I want to do that.
[17997.72s -> 18003.54s]  That would be invincible.
[18003.54s -> 18012.78s]  I just kicked him out of the thing I wanted to keep him in.
[18016.04s -> 18020.49s]  Am I still invincible?
[18020.49s -> 18021.05s]  Nope.
[18021.05s -> 18021.29s]  No.
[18022.09s -> 18025.48s]  I thought I was still invincible.
[18025.48s -> 18026.20s]  Oh that's annoying.
[18036.82s -> 18037.38s]  Good.
[18037.38s -> 18038.74s]  1.5x attack power.
[18046.70s -> 18048.14s]  No it's just going to exist.
[18053.85s -> 18054.81s]  Nobody has to own it.
[18054.81s -> 18056.01s]  It's just going to exist though right?
[18056.73s -> 18076.10s]  That's bad in my way.
[18080.82s -> 18081.78s]  They already have skin?
[18081.78s -> 18082.90s]  Greg don't.
[18082.90s -> 18084.90s]  What is he hitting me with?
[18084.90s -> 18091.24s]  How many healing items are there?
[18091.24s -> 18098.12s]  Old green standing by.
[18108.57s -> 18110.02s]  What's happening?
[18110.02s -> 18110.50s]  What's going on?
[18111.46s -> 18114.42s]  What?
[18114.42s -> 18116.36s]  His screen was like frozen.
[18117.72s -> 18128.68s]  I'll give you $10 for the channel.
[18129.32s -> 18134.73s]  As you know this channel is worth $2 to $5 billion or like $100 billion.
[18135.37s -> 18136.33s]  We looked at it last time.
[18143.03s -> 18143.99s]  What's the channel worth I think?
[18144.55s -> 18149.35s]  What's my collective online internet channel's worth collectively?
[18156.04s -> 18161.80s]  If like a company were to wake up tomorrow morning with all of my logins and it's theirs.
[18161.80s -> 18166.17s]  I'm going to say a clean $20 million.
[18173.64s -> 18174.84s]  Not even close probably.
[18179.30s -> 18180.42s]  $20 million.
[18185.38s -> 18185.70s]  $10 million?
[18187.94s -> 18189.06s]  You think that's more than a million?
[18190.34s -> 18190.90s]  What do you think?
[18190.90s -> 18191.38s]  My channel?
[18200.28s -> 18200.84s]  $8 million?
[18201.78s -> 18202.34s]  $6 million?
[18202.82s -> 18206.01s]  $750,000?
[18206.87s -> 18207.59s]  $1 million?
[18207.59s -> 18209.77s]  Okay.
[18209.77s -> 18215.82s]  $3 million?
[18215.82s -> 18216.30s]  $2 million?
[18217.58s -> 18219.02s]  You're slowly coming down.
[18219.02s -> 18221.74s]  Well you're collectively slowly coming down.
[18221.74s -> 18225.74s]  It started at like $10-$20 million and now it's like you guys are being like,
[18225.74s -> 18226.78s]  actually no not even close.
[18227.50s -> 18228.78s]  It keeps going like $10.
[18228.78s -> 18229.50s]  Five.
[18229.50s -> 18229.90s]  Four.
[18229.90s -> 18230.46s]  Three.
[18230.46s -> 18230.94s]  Two.
[18230.94s -> 18231.18s]  One.
[18232.38s -> 18233.90s]  This is the auction now.
[18240.55s -> 18242.15s]  I know what this channel is worth.
[18242.89s -> 18243.69s]  Priceless.
[18243.69s -> 18244.81s]  How's that sound?
[18244.81s -> 18248.86s]  I'd like to get down there though so I could like actually do the mission.
[18249.58s -> 18251.26s]  It's just priceless.
[18251.66s -> 18251.90s]  To me.
[18259.19s -> 18260.31s]  $10 million or go fuck yourself.
[18262.09s -> 18262.65s]  To where I stand.
[18277.22s -> 18278.34s]  And we're off.
[18278.34s -> 18280.33s]  A $20 gift card.
[18288.68s -> 18290.28s]  It's not worth anything without you.
[18292.44s -> 18294.12s]  Oh man that was like actually.
[18294.84s -> 18296.28s]  I mean we're all just fucking around.
[18296.28s -> 18303.88s]  I'm just messing around here but damn I like I felt that one.
[18303.88s -> 18304.68s]  I did.
[18304.68s -> 18319.32s]  He's getting a big head.
[18319.32s -> 18321.96s]  Now anytime I feel like I'm getting a big head I just like pull the,
[18321.96s -> 18325.00s]  I just open up the little thing in the back of my neck and let some air out.
[18331.08s -> 18332.68s]  You gotta let the air out every now and then you do.
[18333.40s -> 18349.08s]  A nice dad joke.
[18349.08s -> 18349.72s]  Thanks.
[18349.72s -> 18352.58s]  All right somebody said this was actually hard.
[18353.14s -> 18354.10s]  Oh we'll see how hard.
[18354.74s -> 18366.06s]  Okay here we go.
[18366.06s -> 18367.18s]  Alligator attack.
[18367.18s -> 18368.06s]  This one's the hard one.
[18378.17s -> 18378.89s]  Two full minutes.
[18409.05s -> 18410.73s]  Focus on this guy first before the red guy.
[18411.77s -> 18417.56s]  I don't know how close he needs to get to kill me.
[18444.25s -> 18446.09s]  I wouldn't say this one's particularly harder than the last one.
[18488.10s -> 18488.42s]  Nice.
[18489.06s -> 18492.73s]  That was close.
[18492.73s -> 18494.25s]  If I didn't get the devil it might not have done it.
[18495.13s -> 18501.06s]  Take the gold.
[18508.04s -> 18511.91s]  5,500.
[18511.91s -> 18512.63s]  Nice.
[18512.63s -> 18516.65s]  Is there another one after that?
[18519.88s -> 18521.08s]  What do I?
[18522.57s -> 18524.57s]  I need 45,000.
[18524.57s -> 18525.85s]  So I got a long way to go actually.
[18525.85s -> 18527.05s]  I need some more missions.
[18527.69s -> 18535.80s]  I'll do the mission over here.
[18536.36s -> 18542.06s]  What's your favorite Star Trek?
[18542.06s -> 18543.50s]  I actually have only watched.
[18543.50s -> 18549.34s]  I'm probably gonna make a lot of people mad and I think I've said this before but you know
[18549.34s -> 18550.38s]  there's a lot of new people here.
[18552.62s -> 18559.27s]  So Star Trek Voyager is the Star Trek that I actually watched the whole thing through.
[18567.93s -> 18571.50s]  I've seen a fair amount of The Next Generation.
[18574.62s -> 18579.03s]  I've seen one clip from the original series
[18579.51s -> 18586.46s]  because it was in a Jim Carrey movie and I've not seen anything after that.
[18587.18s -> 18591.34s]  I especially have not seen the Star Trek Rick and Morty edition.
[18591.34s -> 18593.51s]  I've seen that one.
[18593.51s -> 18594.95s]  I don't know anything about that one.
[18601.61s -> 18605.54s]  I don't know anything about it.
[18607.14s -> 18609.77s]  I saw an advertisement for it.
[18609.77s -> 18611.53s]  I really thought it was a Rick and Morty episode.
[18612.89s -> 18615.34s]  That's it.
[18617.34s -> 18617.98s]  Roll crazy.
[18618.70s -> 18635.80s]  Don't throw crazy.
[18635.80s -> 18636.44s]  No, not anymore.
[18636.44s -> 18647.74s]  What's the...
[18647.74s -> 18650.63s]  What came after Next Generation?
[18650.63s -> 18651.35s]  Was it Voyager?
[18664.34s -> 18665.22s]  Oh, Deep Space Nine.
[18665.22s -> 18665.54s]  That's right.
[18665.54s -> 18667.14s]  I think I've seen some Deep Space Nine.
[18667.78s -> 18678.97s]  Not very much but I've seen a little bit.
[18678.97s -> 18682.41s]  What's the one with Why Was Six Afraid of Seven?
[18682.41s -> 18682.97s]  Because Seven Eight Nine.
[18682.97s -> 18683.37s]  What was it?
[18683.37s -> 18684.01s]  Who's that?
[18684.01s -> 18685.21s]  Is that Deep Space Nine?
[18693.18s -> 18695.34s]  That's Voyager.
[18696.30s -> 18700.47s]  Careful.
[18700.47s -> 18701.03s]  Careful.
[18701.03s -> 18701.59s]  Careful.
[18701.59s -> 18702.07s]  Oh, boy.
[18702.07s -> 18702.63s]  I'm in trouble.
[18711.86s -> 18718.09s]  He's got cubes.
[18723.85s -> 18725.69s]  Your next lot effect will always be Mustang.
[18725.69s -> 18725.93s]  Good.
[18726.73s -> 18731.05s]  You're reading chat too much.
[18732.66s -> 18733.78s]  You would love Deep Space Nine.
[18733.78s -> 18734.58s]  You would love Quark.
[18734.58s -> 18735.46s]  He loves gambling.
[18738.10s -> 18739.38s]  I don't love gambling.
[18740.26s -> 18745.54s]  I just heavily enjoy RNG and Rift.
[18746.34s -> 18757.82s]  I want to kill this guy back here.
[18758.54s -> 18765.82s]  So much health.
[18787.19s -> 18795.51s]  Good.
[18798.18s -> 18800.30s]  Good.
[18800.30s -> 18800.78s]  Welcome back.
[18803.40s -> 18803.72s]  Good.
[18804.68s -> 18811.62s]  Excuse me.
[18813.22s -> 18813.70s]  Excuse me.
[18814.26s -> 18815.62s]  What's happening on my face?
[18816.42s -> 18819.06s]  Oh, he hit me with one of the parasites, right?
[18837.21s -> 18838.65s]  I'm reading a bio paper right now.
[18838.65s -> 18840.09s]  Thanks for the relaxing fight sounds.
[18840.09s -> 18840.65s]  Hey, you're welcome.
[18841.53s -> 18844.95s]  I'm about to fight the Nameless King for the first time.
[18846.39s -> 18846.95s]  Don't tell him.
[18847.91s -> 18866.28s]  All right.
[18866.28s -> 18868.15s]  I think I have enough now.
[18868.15s -> 18870.73s]  Just barely enough.
[18870.73s -> 18878.12s]  There's another fight mission over here.
[18884.60s -> 18887.56s]  I need to refill my sushi because it's gotten me killed like two times now.
[18908.68s -> 18909.16s]  Straight ahead.
[18913.34s -> 18916.30s]  Are you ever going to do anything familiar to the dollhouse in the future?
[18919.21s -> 18919.77s]  Probably not.
[18920.49s -> 18923.40s]  I'm going to do something hopefully to that scale.
[18924.04s -> 18925.58s]  I want to do that more often.
[18929.50s -> 18931.10s]  I kind of like to move on to the next thing.
[18935.70s -> 18937.54s]  Hey, come what?
[18937.54s -> 18938.98s]  How would you jump that far?
[18938.98s -> 18940.90s]  I'm trying to stay away from him.
[18940.90s -> 18949.10s]  Whatever.
[18955.22s -> 18964.42s]  But I talked about this a few streams ago.
[18964.42s -> 18968.04s]  It doesn't have to be that scale every time.
[18968.04s -> 18975.98s]  I want each calendar year to have a couple of smaller scale streams,
[18975.98s -> 18979.58s]  a couple of mid scale streams, and a couple of large scale streams.
[18979.58s -> 18982.31s]  This is all right.
[18983.11s -> 18987.66s]  Well, space peacock.
[18988.81s -> 18990.33s]  Super giant bird monster.
[18990.97s -> 18993.98s]  Be sure to reveal his weak spot.
[18993.98s -> 18994.78s]  Watch him closely.
[18994.78s -> 18996.78s]  Something's got to be hiding in those colorful chairs.
[18996.78s -> 18997.74s]  Is this Simon?
[18997.74s -> 19001.14s]  It's Simon Says.
[19001.70s -> 19003.02s]  Hey, fly for shy.
[19003.02s -> 19004.86s]  Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[19004.86s -> 19006.30s]  Wait, those are tier three.
[19006.30s -> 19007.26s]  Holy shit, dude.
[19009.86s -> 19011.78s]  10 tier three subs.
[19011.78s -> 19012.50s]  What are you doing?
[19014.90s -> 19015.22s]  Thank you.
[19015.22s -> 19016.02s]  That's crazy.
[19016.02s -> 19017.74s]  Where'd he go?
[19022.09s -> 19022.57s]  Watch it.
[19023.21s -> 19027.85s]  This guy's much more difficult than the other one.
[19029.11s -> 19029.75s]  Oh, my god.
[19029.75s -> 19031.03s]  It's a lot to pay attention to.
[19031.03s -> 19031.83s]  I can't.
[19031.83s -> 19032.87s]  You know what's freaking me out about this?
[19032.87s -> 19034.23s]  I can't move forward or backward.
[19034.23s -> 19035.59s]  I can only move up or down.
[19035.59s -> 19041.27s]  I wonder if the color is any purple.
[19041.27s -> 19044.49s]  I think it was purple.
[19045.21s -> 19046.98s]  It is purple.
[19047.94s -> 19048.26s]  All right.
[19048.26s -> 19051.14s]  Yeah, I understand.
[19051.14s -> 19057.94s]  How do I get away from that?
[19058.58s -> 19063.05s]  It's gone.
[19063.05s -> 19063.61s]  Time for red.
[19063.61s -> 19064.01s]  Go kill.
[19064.01s -> 19064.51s]  Jesus.
[19066.92s -> 19072.98s]  Where are you going?
[19076.06s -> 19080.54s]  Now what?
[19080.54s -> 19080.94s]  Yellow.
[19081.66s -> 19082.22s]  My health.
[19083.18s -> 19086.44s]  Yikes.
[19086.44s -> 19092.15s]  Super kill.
[19092.15s -> 19092.65s]  Blue.
[19092.89s -> 19094.09s]  First blood.
[19094.09s -> 19102.27s]  What is phase two going to be like then?
[19102.27s -> 19111.92s]  Oh, he's sucking me up.
[19124.33s -> 19124.89s]  Phase two.
[19124.89s -> 19125.39s]  What is it?
[19126.09s -> 19126.97s]  Super.
[19126.97s -> 19127.85s]  Right in the middle?
[19127.85s -> 19128.25s]  In the head?
[19128.97s -> 19132.19s]  In the back?
[19132.99s -> 19139.18s]  Oh, my goodness.
[19139.18s -> 19139.58s]  I don't know.
[19140.46s -> 19142.91s]  And just floating around in between these stupid killers.
[19143.71s -> 19146.41s]  The back.
[19147.05s -> 19149.68s]  Ay, yi, yi.
[19149.68s -> 19150.72s]  Oh, my god.
[19150.72s -> 19152.08s]  It sucks to have to do this.
[19154.88s -> 19159.93s]  Oh, I need to hit it one more time.
[19160.89s -> 19161.93s]  That was actually hard.
[19162.49s -> 19164.76s]  I got 50 subs.
[19169.28s -> 19170.64s]  Bill one shallow.
[19172.88s -> 19174.56s]  I got 50 community subs.
[19175.36s -> 19180.92s]  That's a lot.
[19181.56s -> 19183.66s]  And 20 tier two?
[19184.22s -> 19188.32s]  Who gives 20 tier two?
[19188.32s -> 19189.84s]  Fly for Shy gives 20 tier two.
[19192.84s -> 19196.04s]  That was 10 tier three from Fly for Shy.
[19196.68s -> 19200.17s]  20 tier two from Fly for Shy.
[19200.17s -> 19202.97s]  And then 50 tier one from Bill one shallow.
[19203.77s -> 19208.22s]  And then, oh, my goodness gracious.
[19208.94s -> 19215.72s]  That's absurd.
[19215.72s -> 19216.36s]  That's a lot.
[19217.08s -> 19219.08s]  Tier threes and tier twos.
[19219.80s -> 19228.76s]  Thanks a lot, guys.
[19229.32s -> 19231.26s]  I got enough money.
[19232.14s -> 19233.90s]  It is time to do the next boss.
[19233.90s -> 19235.42s]  And then after that boss, we're going to call it.
[19236.06s -> 19240.41s]  I'm going to get the scorpion right now.
[19240.41s -> 19241.29s]  I'm not going to overthink it.
[19241.29s -> 19241.93s]  I'm just going to get it.
[19242.49s -> 19245.80s]  I don't even overthink it.
[19245.80s -> 19246.68s]  Just stay behind him.
[19247.63s -> 19249.07s]  And got it.
[19252.99s -> 19253.63s]  Silver.
[19253.63s -> 19261.92s]  I'm going to get out of here.
[19262.56s -> 19266.20s]  I'm going to have to run all the way back here.
[19274.20s -> 19274.52s]  Yeah.
[19274.52s -> 19278.68s]  We'll conclude today's stream after this fight and cut scenes and everything.
[19279.48s -> 19282.06s]  And then I'll see you guys on Friday.
[19283.39s -> 19284.91s]  The launch of WarioWare.
[19284.91s -> 19287.66s]  And then we'll finish No More Heroes the next day.
[19288.22s -> 19301.13s]  I'm just trying to get here as fast as I can.
[19301.13s -> 19301.61s]  I don't even care.
[19302.41s -> 19304.91s]  When are you going to play Freddy Fish?
[19305.47s -> 19306.41s]  I don't know, dude.
[19333.37s -> 19337.77s]  I swear to god if this guy dies before we get to see who it is.
[19340.75s -> 19342.75s]  We have to assume it's going to happen now, right?
[19367.95s -> 19369.15s]  Do a prediction?
[19369.15s -> 19370.11s]  Yeah, do a prediction.
[19370.11s -> 19371.55s]  I don't know, wait.
[19372.11s -> 19372.99s]  I'll pause it before we see.
[19373.47s -> 19374.67s]  So much.
[19374.67s -> 19377.79s]  Does this guy get baited and they die before we fight him?
[19378.51s -> 19378.99s]  Yes or no?
[19378.99s -> 19380.27s]  I have so much energy.
[19382.17s -> 19383.21s]  I'll go win.
[19384.49s -> 19385.05s]  Go, Lee.
[19387.66s -> 19388.70s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[19388.70s -> 19389.74s]  If you already played the game.
[19390.46s -> 19393.74s]  This is not an exclusive stream of the game that no one's ever done.
[19395.87s -> 19398.64s]  What am I talking about?
[19403.47s -> 19405.15s]  Half of you guys could have already beaten this game.
[19405.79s -> 19406.91s]  And just get free points.
[19407.55s -> 19411.44s]  Damn.
[19411.44s -> 19412.48s]  Okay, well, we're going to upgrade.
[19413.12s -> 19423.96s]  You could also just Google it.
[19423.96s -> 19425.00s]  Yeah, don't do a prediction.
[19425.00s -> 19425.88s]  That's right.
[19425.88s -> 19431.72s]  If you lost that prediction, then I think that holy shit, something would be wrong, right?
[19431.72s -> 19434.28s]  Oh, no.
[19434.28s -> 19437.84s]  Or that person really is just trying to play along.
[19438.48s -> 19440.04s]  And they don't want to go look it up.
[19440.04s -> 19441.64s]  So they actually have altruism.
[19441.64s -> 19443.64s]  And they're actually like a good person.
[19443.64s -> 19449.18s]  Points have been ruined by coin flips anyways.
[19449.98s -> 19456.41s]  All right, what do we got?
[19456.41s -> 19457.66s]  I'm going to say...
[19459.66s -> 19460.78s]  Attack, battery.
[19464.94s -> 19465.58s]  That's a lot.
[19465.58s -> 19466.62s]  I'll do attack.
[19467.26s -> 19468.65s]  Attack or health?
[19468.65s -> 19468.97s]  Health.
[19472.86s -> 19475.02s]  Do I have enough for attack or another health?
[19475.02s -> 19476.94s]  I do.
[19483.36s -> 19483.60s]  Dang.
[19484.24s -> 19491.40s]  I have the sushi I need.
[19491.40s -> 19492.76s]  And I can do it anyways after that.
[19492.76s -> 19493.32s]  Let's just go.
[19498.22s -> 19500.06s]  I can guess for debt off.
[19500.06s -> 19503.45s]  Or if I'm wrong, debt gets added.
[19503.45s -> 19520.17s]  The call of battle.
[19520.17s -> 19525.05s]  100 million if you get it right.
[19525.61s -> 19527.23s]  100 million on it.
[19527.23s -> 19527.95s]  No, it's not worth it.
[19530.68s -> 19532.52s]  500 million off if you guessed right.
[19535.60s -> 19536.88s]  But I can just Google it.
[19536.88s -> 19538.56s]  And just go to the bathroom in quotes.
[19539.12s -> 19540.49s]  That's not fair.
[19541.21s -> 19560.88s]  Why would you spoil the game for yourself?
[19560.88s -> 19562.62s]  Yeah, that's also true.
[19562.62s -> 19569.10s]  Well, I mean, half a billion dollars of debt taken off is worth it.
[19569.10s -> 19569.66s]  Shortcut.
[19579.45s -> 19581.20s]  Not doing it.
[19581.20s -> 19584.56s]  I want to experience this game the way I want to experience the way it should be played.
[19587.64s -> 19589.24s]  Doing it at my own pace.
[19590.51s -> 19591.55s]  My own time.
[19593.05s -> 19593.45s]  My own...
[19595.02s -> 19595.26s]  Yes.
[19595.90s -> 19597.55s]  Here we go.
[19597.55s -> 19608.27s]  So this would be rank number four.
[19608.27s -> 19614.16s]  So then on Saturday we will have three ranked battles to do
[19614.16s -> 19615.68s]  before getting to the end of the game.
[19615.68s -> 19623.24s]  I don't think I have enough money to buy sushi.
[19623.80s -> 19632.67s]  Yeah, I've got five heals.
[19642.19s -> 19643.23s]  Wait, is this a...
[19649.48s -> 19650.28s]  Yeah, I got five heals.
[19653.92s -> 19659.28s]  I can't afford the eat-in sushi that I want.
[19659.68s -> 19660.94s]  Plus, I don't want to waste money.
[19660.94s -> 19662.06s]  I think I don't want to.
[19668.56s -> 19670.16s]  Can I make the prediction just for fun?
[19672.16s -> 19675.44s]  Sniper Lee is going to get sniped in the head by somebody that's another sniper.
[19686.41s -> 19687.53s]  This is going to be a different sniper.
[19687.77s -> 19697.00s]  Here we go.
[19697.00s -> 19698.04s]  Let's find out.
[19698.04s -> 19703.45s]  There's a similar area in the other game.
[19750.78s -> 19752.06s]  Is he holding the Enterprise?
[19763.37s -> 19763.85s]  He did.
[19763.85s -> 19764.89s]  He got sniped.
[19767.05s -> 19768.73s]  Wow, I should have bet 500 billion.
[19769.37s -> 19771.05s]  I should have bet half a billion dollars.
[19771.85s -> 19773.13s]  Why did I not do that?
[19773.13s -> 19773.85s]  I should have bet it.
[19773.85s -> 19774.33s]  It's so...
[19774.33s -> 19775.61s]  I knew it was going to happen.
[19791.20s -> 19792.40s]  Why does this keep happening?
[19802.64s -> 19804.72s]  I'm Notorious.
[19804.72s -> 19805.28s]  You're tough.
[19805.92s -> 19807.28s]  What's your story?
[19807.28s -> 19809.44s]  I'm a superhero from Earth.
[19809.44s -> 19814.16s]  And also, I'm the WWWWW Heavyweight Champion.
[19816.11s -> 19817.15s]  Holy shit!
[19821.24s -> 19823.32s]  This guy's a famous pro wrestler.
[19823.32s -> 19825.48s]  Are you really THE Notorious?
[19825.48s -> 19827.00s]  Like, for reals?
[19827.00s -> 19830.44s]  Yeah, I had a couple of overlapping road shows
[19830.44s -> 19833.80s]  and was a little late arriving for the whole threat to the planet thing.
[19834.44s -> 19835.32s]  My apologies.
[19836.04s -> 19838.60s]  You don't have shit to apologize for, man.
[19838.60s -> 19842.60s]  But listen, I kind of feel like a hunter who's had his kill stolen from him.
[19843.16s -> 19845.24s]  It pains me to hear this.
[19845.24s -> 19850.12s]  After all, eliminating external threats is a superhero's duty.
[19850.12s -> 19853.00s]  Are you really an actual superhero?
[19853.00s -> 19855.40s]  Yeah, I'll be it part-time.
[19855.40s -> 19858.12s]  But I am indeed a superhero.
[19859.08s -> 19862.44s]  Champion, please, let me take the fight from here.
[19862.44s -> 19863.48s]  You go wait in the back.
[19863.48s -> 19865.88s]  Champion, I can't do that.
[19865.88s -> 19866.76s]  My duty is...
[19866.76s -> 19870.20s]  Protecting this town is the duty of the people living here.
[19870.20s -> 19871.96s]  And I accepted their challenge.
[19875.39s -> 19876.11s]  Oh, is this a...
[19876.83s -> 19878.03s]  And this is a big if.
[19878.67s -> 19881.87s]  But if I were to get killed, please finish this for me.
[19882.51s -> 19884.51s]  I will, Travis Touchdown.
[19886.06s -> 19887.18s]  Three left.
[19887.18s -> 19889.90s]  I can see that asshole's head on a stick already.
[19890.54s -> 19892.54s]  I'm glad you understand, champion.
[19893.26s -> 19894.70s]  The champion is you.
[19895.66s -> 19897.53s]  You're the real champion.
[19897.53s -> 19898.41s]  Oh, don't do it.
[19899.13s -> 19899.69s]  Don't do it.
[19900.33s -> 19904.60s]  Oh, they're just friends, okay.
[19904.60s -> 19906.84s]  I thought he was gonna like spin me around and throw me.
[19906.84s -> 19911.82s]  This one apparently got skipped.
[19912.38s -> 19915.98s]  Next up is the number three ranked assassin.
[19915.98s -> 19919.50s]  But this is going against the rules.
[19919.50s -> 19921.74s]  It's no fun without any boss fights, right?
[19924.17s -> 19925.45s]  Was that her eye or clipboard?
[19925.45s -> 19926.33s]  Whatever.
[19926.33s -> 19927.53s]  I guess he'll do.
[19928.57s -> 19930.09s]  Now go, Travis.
[19930.09s -> 19930.59s]  Burn.
[19931.37s -> 19934.17s]  Back to the Garden of Insanity once again.
[19934.97s -> 19935.47s]  Click.
[19936.41s -> 19947.44s]  Okay, um, hold on.
[19952.78s -> 19954.86s]  What the fuck is going on in this game?
[19954.86s -> 19956.62s]  Still images, man.
[19956.62s -> 19958.22s]  Something weird is coming.
[19958.22s -> 19959.58s]  Who is it now?
[19962.48s -> 19964.16s]  Switching to blue mode.
[19964.16s -> 19969.42s]  Our power system's functioning.
[19969.42s -> 19970.30s]  This silhouette.
[19972.03s -> 19973.63s]  It's been a while.
[19973.63s -> 19974.51s]  That's destroyed, man.
[19975.55s -> 19976.75s]  That's fucking destroyed, man.
[19977.39s -> 19978.67s]  They just had to put him in the game.
[19978.67s -> 19979.39s]  They had to find a way.
[19991.39s -> 19992.35s]  Another handshake.
[20010.28s -> 20012.36s]  Looks like the main character from Frisky Dingo.
[20013.24s -> 20014.20s]  The fight can't begin.
[20015.16s -> 20015.80s]  Come on.
[20015.80s -> 20017.02s]  No tricks.
[20017.02s -> 20018.22s]  What's that guy's name?
[20018.22s -> 20019.10s]  Can't trust you.
[20019.82s -> 20020.94s]  I'll look me in the eyes.
[20020.94s -> 20021.44s]  Come on.
[20023.20s -> 20024.00s]  Kill face, yeah.
[20024.80s -> 20025.30s]  Okay.
[20025.92s -> 20026.42s]  Fine.
[20027.28s -> 20028.16s]  Let's do this.
[20032.83s -> 20036.67s]  So they had a Switch boss fight into another Switch boss fight.
[20041.87s -> 20043.39s]  Seriously?
[20043.39s -> 20045.79s]  This guy seriously fell for it.
[20046.67s -> 20047.79s]  Why are we fighting this guy?
[20047.79s -> 20048.83s]  He just came out of the ground.
[20048.83s -> 20051.87s]  I don't understand.
[20051.87s -> 20054.51s]  This guy is seriously dumb.
[20054.51s -> 20055.87s]  He totally believed me.
[20058.51s -> 20059.01s]  Okay.
[20060.35s -> 20061.07s]  I'm going to die.
[20062.11s -> 20064.27s]  I'm going to laugh myself to death.
[20064.27s -> 20065.15s]  Oh, shit.
[20065.15s -> 20066.19s]  Who else?
[20066.19s -> 20067.63s]  Oh, I'm dying.
[20067.63s -> 20068.59s]  Oh, my god.
[20068.59s -> 20070.83s]  This guy is so stupid.
[20072.99s -> 20074.51s]  I don't fucking think so.
[20074.51s -> 20085.13s]  Oh, we didn't even get to fight him either.
[20088.25s -> 20093.71s]  Oh, it's all destroy man bots.
[20093.71s -> 20094.99s]  Just man versus machine.
[20115.00s -> 20115.88s]  Oh, god.
[20115.88s -> 20117.08s]  This is going to be horrible.
[20118.81s -> 20120.65s]  Mass produced destroy man.
[20121.53s -> 20122.49s]  Third time's the charm.
[20123.21s -> 20126.17s]  They'll attack and drove, so take them down with your death glove skills.
[20126.17s -> 20127.93s]  Don't underestimate that destroy cannon.
[20128.65s -> 20131.45s]  How many times is this guy going to come back to life with his head spinning like that?
[20131.45s -> 20132.33s]  He's freaking me out.
[20133.82s -> 20134.54s]  Ay, yi, yi.
[20139.93s -> 20140.43s]  Ow.
[20144.12s -> 20144.92s]  Wait, he sucks.
[20144.92s -> 20145.96s]  He's like falling down.
[20145.96s -> 20147.24s]  It's a Curly Larry and Moe.
[20155.04s -> 20156.08s]  One of them's just stupid.
[20170.44s -> 20172.36s]  Oh, almost to 777.
[20172.36s -> 20185.20s]  Let me get some.
[20185.20s -> 20186.88s]  I got to fight five and then number 10.
[20195.00s -> 20197.44s]  I like the sounds.
[20197.44s -> 20198.56s]  It sounds like I'm going to have a Game Boy.
[20212.65s -> 20213.45s]  How do I do the dodge?
[20214.01s -> 20215.44s]  Is it AA?
[20216.48s -> 20223.90s]  I thought it was AB.
[20224.86s -> 20228.48s]  Why did I do that?
[20228.48s -> 20229.28s]  I could have just killed that guy.
[20232.48s -> 20244.30s]  It's two, right?
[20244.30s -> 20244.80s]  Yep.
[20255.23s -> 20262.43s]  You hear me?
[20263.05s -> 20264.33s]  I thought it was AB at the same time.
[20265.29s -> 20266.33s]  It is AB at the same time.
[20266.33s -> 20266.89s]  You're a genius.
[20266.89s -> 20267.39s]  Thank you.
[20267.77s -> 20275.12s]  Oh, okay.
[20293.95s -> 20294.45s]  Battery.
[20302.22s -> 20302.72s]  Dodge that.
[20303.42s -> 20303.92s]  My mistake.
[20307.96s -> 20308.84s]  Invincible mode.
[20308.84s -> 20309.34s]  Let's go.
[20310.12s -> 20318.86s]  I don't think I'm invincible anymore.
[20318.86s -> 20319.36s]  Move.
[20338.54s -> 20339.04s]  There it is.
[20339.90s -> 20345.23s]  What is happening?
[20345.23s -> 20350.24s]  I just beat him with my incredibly powerful abilities.
[20350.24s -> 20351.52s]  What the fuck?
[20351.60s -> 20352.72s]  There are millions of them.
[20352.72s -> 20353.22s]  Maybe not.
[20354.43s -> 20355.79s]  This is pretty fucked up, Travis.
[20356.59s -> 20358.27s]  All battles must end.
[20358.83s -> 20359.55s]  Here we go.
[20360.59s -> 20362.59s]  Travis, get away from there.
[20362.59s -> 20363.39s]  What?
[20363.39s -> 20363.89s]  Jam.
[20364.43s -> 20365.31s]  I cast it.
[20365.31s -> 20365.81s]  Cannon.
[20366.75s -> 20371.07s]  Did you get him?
[20371.07s -> 20374.60s]  Located the enemy.
[20374.60s -> 20376.20s]  The real one is down below.
[20376.76s -> 20378.92s]  Leave this to me and get to Central Magna.
[20379.96s -> 20381.32s]  I don't really get it,
[20381.32s -> 20383.96s]  but I need to go down into that hole, I guess.
[20383.96s -> 20384.60s]  You got it.
[20386.84s -> 20387.34s]  Shit.
[20387.82s -> 20388.62s]  This is scary.
[20389.26s -> 20389.76s]  Meow.
[20394.16s -> 20395.04s]  The cat.
[20395.04s -> 20396.00s]  At least hold on to the cat.
[20400.43s -> 20400.93s]  Goodness.
[20403.10s -> 20404.70s]  Omega Destroy Man.
[20409.58s -> 20411.90s]  Now let's have a fair fight.
[20411.90s -> 20412.70s]  This is so dumb.
[20413.42s -> 20415.50s]  So this is the real one, huh?
[20415.50s -> 20416.14s]  This place.
[20416.86s -> 20418.94s]  It's been turned into a Destroy Man factory.
[20419.50s -> 20422.78s]  What the fuck are you even trying to do, you weird-ass bastard?
[20423.66s -> 20426.62s]  I'm Destroy Man, the superhero.
[20427.26s -> 20429.66s]  I destroy the evils of this world.
[20430.70s -> 20433.26s]  Evil assassin, Travis Touchdown.
[20434.22s -> 20437.74s]  I will destroy you.
[20437.74s -> 20438.54s]  Okay, let's go.
[20438.54s -> 20440.78s]  This dude is such an immature little bitch.
[20441.26s -> 20442.14s]  Even more than you.
[20442.94s -> 20446.54s]  This time, I'm really gonna mash up those brains of yours.
[20446.54s -> 20447.90s]  All right, real fight incoming.
[20448.54s -> 20449.50s]  Destroy!
[20449.50s -> 20453.25s]  Bring it on.
[20459.30s -> 20460.74s]  Ooh.
[20461.28s -> 20462.56s]  That was sneaky, wasn't it?
[20463.60s -> 20465.78s]  He's got a lot of health.
[20465.78s -> 20466.90s]  This is gonna be a long fight.
[20468.26s -> 20476.11s]  Okay, easy, easy, easy.
[20479.49s -> 20481.07s]  All right, I gotta run.
[20487.42s -> 20488.30s]  All right, dodge.
[20493.23s -> 20495.07s]  Holy shit, he just double tapped me.
[20495.07s -> 20496.03s]  I forgot they were in the air.
[20496.83s -> 20499.38s]  Okay, I gotta walk around.
[20499.38s -> 20499.78s]  Walk around.
[20499.78s -> 20500.42s]  Don't be an idiot.
[20501.46s -> 20502.58s]  I gotta check his moves out.
[20503.62s -> 20505.36s]  I gotta wait for this.
[20506.16s -> 20508.98s]  Okay, those have to get ran into the wall, for sure.
[20522.91s -> 20525.25s]  All right, let's go.
[20529.36s -> 20530.00s]  Fuck.
[20530.00s -> 20531.28s]  All those things are so hard to dodge.
[20543.62s -> 20544.50s]  That was a good spring.
[20546.27s -> 20553.07s]  All right.
[20571.90s -> 20572.40s]  Man.
[20575.02s -> 20580.24s]  He stunned?
[20583.57s -> 20584.37s]  I thought he stunned.
[20584.37s -> 20585.41s]  All right, phase two incoming.
[20586.05s -> 20592.16s]  Move back.
[20603.06s -> 20607.07s]  That's a huge AOE, okay.
[20607.07s -> 20608.83s]  All right, he's got a few more moves.
[20608.83s -> 20610.91s]  Destroy cannon.
[20610.91s -> 20613.49s]  I can't just outrun him.
[20613.49s -> 20613.89s]  Fuck.
[20613.89s -> 20615.81s]  Okay, that was really, really close.
[20615.81s -> 20616.85s]  That would have been bad.
[20616.85s -> 20617.81s]  I can't outrun those.
[20619.01s -> 20623.57s]  Oh, yeah.
[20623.57s -> 20624.13s]  Oh, yeah.
[20624.13s -> 20624.53s]  Oh, yeah.
[20624.53s -> 20625.03s]  Let's go.
[20626.43s -> 20627.71s]  That's lucky shit right there.
[20627.71s -> 20628.11s]  Let's move.
[20629.22s -> 20629.86s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[20630.58s -> 20633.07s]  I just killed him.
[20637.38s -> 20638.82s]  That was lucky shit right there.
[20639.70s -> 20640.34s]  Nice, okay.
[20641.62s -> 20642.74s]  Rolled sevens.
[20648.77s -> 20649.27s]  Easy.
[20649.81s -> 20662.48s]  Try man, true face.
[20662.48s -> 20662.98s]  Dead.
[20663.52s -> 20669.66s]  You just skipped the boss, pretty much.
[20670.93s -> 20672.45s]  Although, I'm not on the hardest difficulty though.
[20672.45s -> 20675.01s]  I'm on the medium difficulty.
[20675.01s -> 20676.13s]  There's a difficulty after this.
[20677.01s -> 20679.54s]  There's probably another difficulty after that when you beat the game.
[20680.10s -> 20685.04s]  So, the game probably gets a thousand times harder if you're on the spiciest.
[20687.02s -> 20689.26s]  I'm not on the spicy difficulty.
[20697.60s -> 20699.36s]  I'm not playing on easy, I'm playing on bitter.
[20704.08s -> 20705.68s]  Yeah, I was observant.
[20706.24s -> 20709.52s]  Thanks to you, I was able to stop him.
[20709.52s -> 20711.12s]  He was one tenacious dude.
[20711.92s -> 20713.84s]  Yeah, you got that right.
[20713.84s -> 20714.48s]  All right, champ.
[20715.04s -> 20715.60s]  Let's run.
[20716.24s -> 20716.74s]  Let's.
[20727.50s -> 20728.54s]  What the hell was that?
[20741.44s -> 20742.16s]  Yuck.
[20742.16s -> 20745.84s]  I was rocky.
[20746.72s -> 20757.78s]  Somebody said this seemed a little under tuned for what is medium effectively.
[20757.78s -> 20759.30s]  Can I really hire you to do this?
[20760.02s -> 20763.31s]  If it's a contract, I won't turn it down.
[20763.31s -> 20764.35s]  Kill this man.
[20764.35s -> 20764.91s]  Maybe a little.
[20764.91s -> 20766.35s]  What's the price tag?
[20766.35s -> 20768.27s]  Some of them have been pretty challenging.
[20768.27s -> 20770.35s]  30% of the total stock.
[20771.07s -> 20774.19s]  Convert it into cash, and you'll be a very rich man.
[20774.83s -> 20776.35s]  Sounds like a good plan.
[20776.35s -> 20778.34s]  I'll take the job.
[20778.34s -> 20781.30s]  The transfer is complete.
[20782.02s -> 20782.98s]  Confirmed.
[20782.98s -> 20788.10s]  When are you gonna do it?
[20788.10s -> 20789.95s]  Before the autumn winds blow.
[20790.96s -> 20793.68s]  Seriously, I'm really counting on you.
[20794.24s -> 20795.44s]  Please kill him.
[20796.08s -> 20798.19s]  No need to rush.
[20798.19s -> 20807.38s]  I was not getting hit by.
[20823.98s -> 20824.48s]  I.
[20825.18s -> 20826.38s]  All right, instead, I've.
[20829.79s -> 20831.39s]  I don't, I, whatever.
[20831.39s -> 20832.83s]  There's nothing I can really say right now.
[20842.77s -> 20848.77s]  This is just a series of weird dreams that Suda51 stitched together and made a video game.
[20848.77s -> 20855.76s]  Stuff has, stuff has like no beginnings or ends.
[20855.76s -> 20856.48s]  Just middles.
[20859.10s -> 20859.90s]  And then ends.
[20859.90s -> 20860.86s]  There's middles and ends.
[20861.42s -> 20867.81s]  It's just insane.
[20871.14s -> 20871.94s]  I love it though.
[20871.94s -> 20872.98s]  I think it's hilarious.
[20872.98s -> 20873.78s]  I think it's wonderful.
[20879.49s -> 20881.01s]  Always climaxing.
[20881.01s -> 20881.51s]  Yeah.
[20881.97s -> 20886.66s]  It's just out of context.
[20886.66s -> 20887.16s]  Everything.
[20894.66s -> 20896.02s]  No exposition.
[20896.02s -> 20896.90s]  Just context.
[20897.54s -> 20905.22s]  This is the best No More Heroes game so far.
[20905.86s -> 20906.66s]  You know.
[20908.26s -> 20909.86s]  Now that I'm almost done with it.
[20909.86s -> 20911.22s]  Like another probably few hours.
[20911.78s -> 20915.54s]  That really depends on what you want.
[20915.54s -> 20919.36s]  Because I think this experience has been the best one.
[20919.36s -> 20927.68s]  But I think the first game is more of like almost like a true video game than this one is.
[20927.68s -> 20932.50s]  This seems like a series of interesting things stitched together.
[20932.50s -> 20939.01s]  And the characters are all hilarious and everything is just funny and crazy and out of this world.
[20939.01s -> 20942.77s]  But I think the first one is actually like a like video game.
[20942.77s -> 20946.93s]  This feels less like a video game and more like almost like an interactive dream experience.
[20949.33s -> 20952.50s]  And this one has an actual open big open world to kind of go around.
[20952.50s -> 20954.18s]  If that's I'll be honest it's not that interesting.
[20955.07s -> 20959.47s]  The actual physical open world is not that I mean they put NPCs moving around
[20959.47s -> 20960.59s]  that you can run into with your car.
[20962.75s -> 20967.94s]  For me personally this is the best one.
[20967.94s -> 20974.06s]  But if you're more into I guess more of a structured video game.
[20974.06s -> 20975.98s]  The first two are probably what you're looking for.
[20975.98s -> 20980.16s]  This feels like a lot less structured than the other two.
[20980.16s -> 20982.16s]  But somehow I like it better than the other two.
[20982.16s -> 20986.53s]  I don't see Damon.
[20986.53s -> 20989.25s]  I heard from him in several days.
[20990.05s -> 20991.25s]  What happened with Sonic Juice?
[20991.25s -> 20991.97s]  It's more of a hub.
[20991.97s -> 20993.09s]  Yeah it's not it's more of a hub.
[20993.09s -> 20994.29s]  I cannot get a hold of Mr. Juice either.
[20995.57s -> 20997.89s]  He's probably off training again.
[20997.89s -> 20999.41s]  Sonic is a tough guy.
[20999.41s -> 21001.41s]  I mean it's my fight but still.
[21010.62s -> 21013.66s]  Okay there was something wrong with me there.
[21014.30s -> 21016.06s]  I spent too much time fucking around.
[21016.78s -> 21018.86s]  How many hours of gaming per day?
[21018.86s -> 21020.14s]  10 hours.
[21020.14s -> 21021.34s]  Oh wait that's too much.
[21021.34s -> 21022.70s]  That's too much playing.
[21022.70s -> 21025.34s]  It should be like an hour.
[21025.34s -> 21026.22s]  10 hours is too much.
[21026.22s -> 21027.82s]  I've gotten too caught up in gaming.
[21027.82s -> 21030.11s]  I'm sick of video games.
[21041.92s -> 21042.40s]  Wake up!
[21045.57s -> 21046.45s]  Who is it?
[21046.45s -> 21051.38s]  I'm still sleepy.
[21053.84s -> 21056.16s]  You can't even beat your desire to sleep huh?
[21058.83s -> 21060.11s]  He's just killed him.
[21060.11s -> 21061.23s]  He's just killing this guy.
[21061.23s -> 21062.67s]  And we're not going to be able to fight this one.
[21078.30s -> 21079.90s]  They just gave up on these bosses.
[21081.42s -> 21083.18s]  They just don't give a fuck about these bosses at all.
[21083.90s -> 21084.78s]  There's no rhyme or...
[21084.78s -> 21087.34s]  When I talk about structure this is what I was referring to.
[21088.06s -> 21089.42s]  There's zero structure.
[21089.42s -> 21089.74s]  It's just...
[21090.46s -> 21091.02s]  There's...
[21091.02s -> 21091.66s]  It's nothing.
[21091.66s -> 21092.30s]  It's just all...
[21092.30s -> 21092.94s]  Nobody matters.
[21092.94s -> 21093.50s]  Nothing matters.
[21094.93s -> 21097.73s]  Travis, Touchdown, and Fu are the only characters that matter in the game.
[21097.73s -> 21099.01s]  And maybe Damon as it...
[21099.01s -> 21099.73s]  Nothing else matters.
[21108.78s -> 21110.54s]  And something about that is kind of...
[21111.71s -> 21112.83s]  Refreshing in a way.
[21112.83s -> 21115.31s]  Like, who gives a shit about any of this?
[21115.31s -> 21125.01s]  You forgot about Gold Joe.
[21139.42s -> 21140.54s]  So now there are only two left?
[21141.58s -> 21142.54s]  Yeah, there's only two people left.
[21147.58s -> 21149.58s]  He uses his imagery to push back.
[21149.58s -> 21152.22s]  Without leaving all the work to Kudo's words.
[21152.22s -> 21153.34s]  Push back!
[21153.34s -> 21161.23s]  Charlotte!
[21161.23s -> 21162.99s]  Hey, you want a beer?
[21162.99s -> 21174.06s]  Revival!
[21174.06s -> 21177.86s]  Finally doing better, huh Charlotte?
[21178.50s -> 21179.97s]  Who calling me that?
[21180.69s -> 21181.89s]  It's a nice name.
[21181.89s -> 21182.61s]  It suits you.
[21186.74s -> 21187.70s]  Which Miike movie do you like?
[21187.70s -> 21188.74s]  I'm fucking killing you.
[21188.74s -> 21189.46s]  Miike?
[21191.55s -> 21192.11s]  For reals?
[21192.67s -> 21194.08s]  You don't know Miike?
[21194.72s -> 21197.04s]  He's like a film super director from Japan.
[21197.76s -> 21201.78s]  If it's Japanese stuff give me anime do you like?
[21204.56s -> 21205.28s]  Seriously?
[21206.32s -> 21206.56s]  Was that...
[21206.56s -> 21207.68s]  Was those two real shows?
[21208.48s -> 21218.46s]  Watching together.
[21218.46s -> 21221.15s]  Eisner though.
[21221.15s -> 21224.91s]  Let's drink.
[21231.74s -> 21232.54s]  Aye, aye, aye.
[21232.54s -> 21232.86s]  Okay.
[21235.81s -> 21236.53s]  What a mess.
[21237.57s -> 21239.34s]  This game is a mess.
[21242.24s -> 21243.20s]  It's wonderful.
[21243.20s -> 21244.00s]  Okay.
[21244.00s -> 21245.12s]  Well, I'm gonna save it here.
[21247.70s -> 21248.34s]  Wait.
[21248.34s -> 21249.54s]  Is there any new games with Gene?
[21251.15s -> 21252.27s]  Buy me a new ball.
[21252.27s -> 21259.89s]  Well, let's save it.
[21262.06s -> 21262.46s]  Alright.
[21263.78s -> 21264.42s]  That's gonna be it.
[21265.86s -> 21266.74s]  This has been wonderful.
[21266.74s -> 21269.22s]  We will finish this this coming weekend here.
[21271.30s -> 21274.10s]  I got a feeling there's probably at least another three hours left in the game.
[21274.82s -> 21277.06s]  Somewhere between two and four.
[21278.61s -> 21280.77s]  There's still an entire area that I have not been to.
[21281.57s -> 21282.74s]  I think.
[21282.74s -> 21283.89s]  So.
[21283.89s -> 21285.57s]  I'm assuming there's probably at least another two or three hours.
[21286.13s -> 21287.81s]  Three-ish hours?
[21287.81s -> 21288.45s]  Yeah.
[21288.45s -> 21289.95s]  So I'm not gonna complete it tonight.
[21290.59s -> 21293.95s]  So the next time you see this stream live we'll be playing WarioWare.
[21294.96s -> 21297.57s]  Get It Together.
[21297.57s -> 21298.05s]  At which I...
[21298.61s -> 21299.57s]  This has been insane.
[21299.57s -> 21300.69s]  Somebody said this the other day.
[21301.41s -> 21302.13s]  What?
[21302.13s -> 21303.01s]  I'm being spoiled.
[21304.45s -> 21306.45s]  Two of my favorite franchises.
[21306.53s -> 21309.68s]  I've had brand new games come out.
[21309.68s -> 21313.68s]  That have not had really new games come out in their series in a very long time.
[21316.08s -> 21318.40s]  I've been waiting for No More Heroes 3.
[21318.40s -> 21321.04s]  Like a game like this third person No More Heroes 3.
[21321.04s -> 21324.64s]  Since probably a year after No More Heroes 2 came out.
[21324.64s -> 21325.70s]  This is awesome.
[21326.50s -> 21328.66s]  I've been waiting for a real WarioWare game.
[21329.38s -> 21330.26s]  Since Smooth Moves.
[21331.84s -> 21337.07s]  So we're getting two 10-year sequels here.
[21337.07s -> 21337.55s]  In the first...
[21337.55s -> 21338.51s]  In the two weeks.
[21341.63s -> 21342.59s]  So I'm very excited.
[21343.78s -> 21344.98s]  I will see you guys soon.
[21345.70s -> 21346.20s]  Friday.
[21346.74s -> 21350.50s]  We're gonna be streaming at 2 p.m. Pacific on Friday.
[21350.50s -> 21351.55s]  I'm gonna pull it back.
[21351.55s -> 21353.15s]  I'm not gonna do 4 p.m. anymore.
[21353.15s -> 21355.95s]  I'm gonna pull it back to 2.
[21355.95s -> 21362.86s]  So I'll see you Friday.
[21362.86s -> 21366.54s]  We're gonna have a lot of community subs here through these credits.
[21366.54s -> 21370.98s]  Because there was a shitload of subs given.
[21370.98s -> 21374.27s]  And Psychonauts too.
[21374.27s -> 21375.31s]  Yeah I forgot about Psychonauts.
[21375.31s -> 21376.35s]  What's with the...
[21376.35s -> 21378.91s]  These games that have been celebrated for a decade.
[21378.91s -> 21381.47s]  That just all the sequels came out.
[21381.47s -> 21388.42s]  But if you're curious if you should buy No More Heroes 3 I would say yes.
[21388.42s -> 21389.89s]  Absolutely.
[21389.89s -> 21392.13s]  If you're a fan of this franchise and you think it's an interesting place.
[21392.13s -> 21393.25s]  Interesting concept.
[21393.25s -> 21398.46s]  It looks like there's a shitload of content that's not the actual main game either.
[21398.46s -> 21402.40s]  With the time machine to go back and fight bosses at a harder difficulty.
[21402.40s -> 21403.52s]  For materials.
[21403.52s -> 21405.25s]  That's cool.
[21405.25s -> 21412.10s]  Did you beat the game?
[21412.10s -> 21414.32s]  No I did not.
[21414.32s -> 21417.52s]  You will see the end of this game on Saturday of this coming week.
[21417.52s -> 21420.30s]  I want to make room for WarioWare.
[21420.30s -> 21421.98s]  Remember I am twice a week Andy.
[21421.98s -> 21429.86s]  It's only on the Switch.
[21429.86s -> 21432.66s]  As of right now No More Heroes 3 is only on the Switch.
[21432.66s -> 21438.90s]  So who knows if the coming next six months, year or whatever it might.
[21438.90s -> 21441.46s]  Show its face on PC or Xbox or something.
[21441.46s -> 21442.42s]  The other two did.
[21442.42s -> 21443.63s]  We'll see.
[21443.63s -> 21457.62s]  It makes it more special that it's on the Switch.
[21457.62s -> 21464.53s]  It's nice to see Nintendo have exclusives that are not just first party stuff.
[21464.53s -> 21465.81s]  Worth having the console for.
[21465.81s -> 21469.63s]  I think the Switch is a really good console but kind of adds just to it right?
[21469.63s -> 21482.67s]  It's time for tuna.
[21482.67s -> 21483.63s]  It is time for tuna.
[21485.02s -> 21485.90s]  A tuna melt.
[21486.86s -> 21488.14s]  Of all things.
[21488.14s -> 21492.62s]  What do I- hold on.
[21492.62s -> 21493.82s]  What kind of cheese am I going to get though?
[21494.38s -> 21496.43s]  Do I have cheese?
[21496.43s -> 21498.19s]  Oh shit this is a disaster.
[21498.19s -> 21501.79s]  This is a disaster in the making.
[21502.35s -> 21504.03s]  I don't know if I have cheese.
[21504.03s -> 21508.22s]  You can't have a tuna melt without the melt portion.
[21508.22s -> 21509.70s]  That doesn't work.
[21509.70s -> 21512.61s]  Uh oh.
[21512.61s -> 21516.11s]  That's bad news.
[21516.11s -> 21522.67s]  Do I have- I gotta see if I have cheese.
[21522.67s -> 21524.88s]  Alright I'm gonna go.
[21524.88s -> 21526.00s]  I'll see you guys on Friday.
[21526.00s -> 21526.72s]  Goodbye.
[21526.72s -> 21527.44s]  Good night.
[21527.44s -> 21528.48s]  Take care of yourselves.
[21528.48s -> 21529.92s]  Thanks for watching as always.
[21529.92s -> 21535.42s]  I'll see you soon.
[21537.81s -> 21538.53s]  Don't forget about me.
[21538.53s -> 21539.33s]  I won't forget about you.
[21541.55s -> 21541.79s]  No.
[21541.79s -> 21542.27s]  Good night.
[21542.27s -> 21543.31s]  I'll see you later.
