[5.50s -> 10.30s]  What's up? Hey, you know shit. I don't want any trouble. I'm already gone.
[11.34s -> 14.64s]  Thought it was an MPC. Get back or you will get shot.
[15.14s -> 19.34s]  I thought this dude was gonna sell me like clothes and baggage and potions and shit.
[21.11s -> 23.11s]  I'm going I'm gonna go that way.
[24.88s -> 26.98s]  Just this is when you rush the guy. This is when you rush the guy.
[33.93s -> 34.63s]  Back off.
[35.53s -> 36.73s]  Don't make me use this.
[37.33s -> 38.53s]  Okay, you get the idea.
[39.03s -> 39.53s]  What are you doing?
[40.77s -> 41.77s]  Back off.
[43.27s -> 44.27s]  I'm not gonna say it again.
[45.27s -> 46.27s]  Get the hell out of here.
[47.27s -> 47.77s]  Thank you.
[48.77s -> 50.77s]  Do you not hear what I was doing? Like what is this?
[51.27s -> 52.27s]  I have a gun.
[52.77s -> 53.77s]  Like are you stupid?
[56.27s -> 58.27s]  This is one of the ugliest games I've ever played.
[59.46s -> 61.46s]  Look at the background. It's like a bad TV reception.
[62.33s -> 64.33s]  I want to like smack my monitor and make it better.
[64.83s -> 68.28s]  We don't share get out.
[68.78s -> 70.28s]  This old woman's packing.
[75.60s -> 77.10s]  Go and tell your friends that Granny's got a gun.
[78.60s -> 81.60s]  Granny's got a gun. Do I have to kill Granny?
[82.10s -> 83.10s]  I really don't want to.
[83.60s -> 85.34s]  Okay, Granny, you know what?
[89.30s -> 93.97s]  This lady is sitting under a sign that says we won't share get out.
[95.10s -> 96.10s]  And she's sitting there with a gun.
[97.41s -> 98.41s]  Why wouldn't you just be inside?
[100.48s -> 102.48s]  You're just antagonizing people right now.
[102.48s -> 103.48s]  Are you serious?
[103.98s -> 104.98s]  And how do you not see me?
[107.98s -> 109.48s]  And she fucking killed me again.
[116.12s -> 117.12s]  Fuck you, Granny.
[120.80s -> 121.80s]  She's freaking out.
[133.25s -> 134.25s]  I don't feel good about that at all.
[145.39s -> 146.89s]  I keep thinking about the old lady.
[147.89s -> 149.13s]  That was terrible.
[150.44s -> 152.44s]  Not a moment goes by that we're not thinking about you.
[153.93s -> 154.93s]  I don't care about this at all.
[155.93s -> 157.93s]  I just slid an old lady's throat.
[158.93s -> 160.93s]  Too late. You're dead.
[162.36s -> 163.36s]  I'm not dead.
[163.86s -> 165.42s]  You asked for it.
[165.92s -> 167.92s]  Die. I'll take them down.
[169.92s -> 172.19s]  Why was I looking down?
[173.19s -> 175.75s]  That's a pretty big drop down there.
[178.08s -> 180.08s]  Every encounter plays out exactly the same in this game.
[181.08s -> 182.51s]  Like people just come out of the rafters.
[183.01s -> 184.51s]  See, look, people just come out of the rafters.
[184.51s -> 185.51s]  Like it's a play.
[186.51s -> 189.51s]  All right, it's your cue, guys. Get out. You're on stage left and stage right.
[190.51s -> 191.68s]  Here you go, he's going to say.
[192.68s -> 193.68s]  You're in the wrong part of town.
[194.68s -> 195.68s]  Can they do a different thing?
[196.68s -> 197.68s]  And watch, I'm going to surprise kill this guy.
[198.68s -> 199.68s]  Shoot the guy over here.
[200.68s -> 201.68s]  And then everyone else is going to be scared.
[202.68s -> 205.68s]  It's like every encounter is exactly the fucking same.
[209.18s -> 210.18s]  Keep those hands up.
[211.18s -> 212.18s]  Yeah, I got a gun. That's right.
[212.18s -> 213.18s]  That's right.
[214.18s -> 215.18s]  Yeah, yeah.
[216.18s -> 217.18s]  I do have a gun.
[218.18s -> 219.18s]  You're stating the obvious.
[220.18s -> 221.18s]  No, I'm not.
[226.18s -> 233.86s]  Here's another exciting adventure of Climb the Tower.
[236.96s -> 237.96s]  Hope you're all excited.
[238.96s -> 239.96s]  I'm serious.
[240.96s -> 244.09s]  What the fuck was that?
[249.09s -> 250.09s]  Oh, boy.
[251.09s -> 252.09s]  Got to play a negotiator.
[253.09s -> 255.09s]  Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen, calm down for a second here.
[256.09s -> 257.09s]  The Tootsie Rolls, there's five of them.
[258.09s -> 259.09s]  We're going to split them up easily.
[260.09s -> 262.09s]  Look, you don't have to be that kind of hasty.
[263.09s -> 269.98s]  Oh, well, I just came into five Tootsie Rolls.
[270.98s -> 274.20s]  I'm going to take you apart.
[275.20s -> 276.20s]  I read you loud and clear.
[278.60s -> 279.60s]  Fuck.
[280.84s -> 282.84s]  Take it easy, man.
[283.84s -> 284.84s]  Did he just say goodbye to me?
[286.28s -> 287.28s]  Take it easy, man.
[288.28s -> 289.77s]  See you later.
[290.77s -> 291.77s]  Nice to meet you, by the way.
[292.77s -> 293.77s]  I'm Angry Guy with Machete Number 48.
[294.77s -> 297.42s]  I'm scared.
[298.66s -> 299.66s]  Don't look down.
[301.41s -> 302.41s]  In fact, just close your eyes.
[303.41s -> 304.41s]  Open them only when I tell you.
[305.91s -> 306.91s]  Okay.
[310.26s -> 311.26s]  No way I can drop that.
[314.29s -> 315.29s]  Bodies everywhere.
[318.95s -> 319.95s]  It's your lucky day.
[320.95s -> 321.95s]  You're pretending to be dead?
[322.95s -> 324.57s]  Why would you be doing that?
[325.57s -> 328.13s]  There's no reason why you'd be doing that.
[328.13s -> 329.13s]  These are the only guys in the whole game that have done that.
[330.13s -> 331.31s]  When did this become Dark Souls?
[332.31s -> 349.04s]  I can't even react.
[350.04s -> 354.71s]  When I get a hold of you, I'm going to take you apart.
[355.71s -> 359.12s]  Shoot all you want.
[364.97s -> 365.97s]  I'm bulletproof.
[369.58s -> 370.58s]  That's not something you should be saying to somebody.
[371.58s -> 372.95s]  Did you see that guy today?
[373.95s -> 374.95s]  What guy?
[375.95s -> 376.95s]  I heard someone saw a guy just walking around the streets.
[377.95s -> 378.95s]  I thought maybe you saw him too.
[379.95s -> 380.95s]  A guy?
[381.95s -> 382.95s]  Yeah, I heard about that guy.
[383.95s -> 384.95s]  Good thing I didn't see him.
[385.95s -> 387.95s]  Where are all the guys walking around?
[388.95s -> 389.95s]  Did you guys hear about that guy?
[392.95s -> 393.95s]  There was a guy over there.
[394.95s -> 395.95s]  And it was me.
[396.95s -> 397.95s]  I'm the guy.
[398.95s -> 399.95s]  That's right. We're all shocked.
[400.95s -> 404.95s]  Why don't you go tell your friends that the guy is going to be around for a long fucking time.
[405.95s -> 409.04s]  That's the whole game?
[410.04s -> 413.78s]  I feel like I didn't do anything.
[415.72s -> 416.72s]  I just held my gun at some people.
[417.72s -> 419.72s]  Carried around a little girl like a kangaroo.
[421.41s -> 422.41s]  Climbed a couple of buildings.
[424.36s -> 425.36s]  I did murder an old lady too.
[426.36s -> 428.36s]  I did murder an old lady so that was pretty significant.
