[0.76s -> 14.62s]  I just want to try it. I'm just going to try it. I'm just going to try it. Just a little bit.
[14.62s -> 21.58s]  I just want to see what it looks like. I just want to see what it looks like. I just want to test it.
[21.58s -> 25.58s]  I'm just going to test it. God, it's been six hours. I'm just going to test it out.
[25.58s -> 50.21s]  Ah, I just want to test it.
[50.21s -> 55.21s]  Other babes. Ghost of the Babe, New Babe Plus. Which one is it?
[55.21s -> 60.09s]  Oh shit, I have to do window capture.
[60.09s -> 71.72s]  Oh right, because it's fucked up. I forgot.
[71.72s -> 76.39s]  Alright, hold on. Be right back.
[76.39s -> 80.39s]  Is this going to be my first 16 hour stream? No, it is not. It is not going to be that.
[83.39s -> 85.39s]  Where's window capture?
[89.66s -> 92.66s]  Where's window capture? I need to do this now. Let's go.
[92.66s -> 103.41s]  It's not going to be 17 hours.
[103.41s -> 113.86s]  There we go. Alright, let's go.
[113.86s -> 116.86s]  What is it? New Babe Plus? Which one is it?
[116.86s -> 127.17s]  Ghost of the Babe?
[127.17s -> 129.17s]  No, what? Continue?
[129.17s -> 140.81s]  Ghost of the Babe. Are you sure? Delete, save, or no?
[140.81s -> 143.81s]  This is worded very strangely. Continue.
[143.81s -> 153.73s]  Now, let me see if I can remember how to play.
[153.73s -> 169.87s]  Alright, it's going to take me a minute to remember how to play.
[169.87s -> 202.45s]  Alright, I remember. I remember. I remember.
[202.45s -> 207.38s]  Okay, I don't...
[210.92s -> 212.92s]  No, I gotta eat food and then do this. No, alright.
[212.92s -> 214.92s]  No, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, it's too late.
[214.92s -> 218.92s]  It's like I have to stop right now before this gets any worse.
[218.92s -> 221.29s]  I have to stop before this gets any worse.
[221.29s -> 245.88s]  Oops. Okay. I fucked up. It's alright. I can't even get to the DLC yet.
[245.88s -> 249.88s]  Yeah, I played this game like fucking two weeks ago. I haven't played it since.
[249.88s -> 251.88s]  I've been dreaming about it.
[251.88s -> 275.65s]  He's obsessed with it. I'm not obsessed with it.
[275.65s -> 282.50s]  Alright. You know, it's alright.
[282.50s -> 286.12s]  Alright, I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. I have to stop this now.
[286.12s -> 288.12s]  I know what's going to happen and this is going to be bad.
[288.12s -> 296.31s]  I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. Somebody get me.
[296.31s -> 298.31s]  Somebody get me now. Somebody come get me.
[298.31s -> 302.73s]  Come get me. Somebody come get me.
[302.73s -> 304.73s]  Come get me. Somebody come get me.
[307.03s -> 319.06s]  He's trapped. No, I'm not.
[319.06s -> 322.06s]  I'm just trying to... I want to get to the DLC and save it there.
[322.06s -> 326.10s]  I just want to get to the DLC and save it there and that's it.
[326.10s -> 327.10s]  And that's it. And then I'll be done.
[327.10s -> 352.74s]  I just want to get to the DLC and then we'll take a look.
[352.74s -> 363.49s]  We'll just take a look when we get there.
[363.49s -> 372.79s]  Oops. Oops. It's okay. It's alright. Fine.
[372.79s -> 379.19s]  It's alright. I'm just... I gotta get...
[379.19s -> 380.19s]  Coin? I don't care.
[380.19s -> 382.19s]  Coin has nothing to do with the DLC.
[382.19s -> 386.29s]  Alright, I gotta get this one right. I gotta get that.
[386.29s -> 387.29s]  It's been pretty smooth so far.
[387.29s -> 390.29s]  No major fuck ups. Just getting back in the swing of things.
[390.29s -> 400.78s]  I fucked it up. It's alright.
[400.78s -> 402.78s]  Oh man. I fucked it up. I have to go.
[402.78s -> 415.20s]  Alright. I have to leave. Like right now.
[415.20s -> 424.80s]  Somebody come get me.
[424.80s -> 425.80s]  Somebody come get me.
[425.80s -> 433.10s]  I'm trying to go so fast just to get to the...
[433.10s -> 435.10s]  I just want to get to the DLC and then I'll be done.
[435.10s -> 440.02s]  Seriously. It's not even that hard.
[440.02s -> 442.71s]  It's not. I'm just like brushing and freaking out.
[442.71s -> 452.18s]  I want to do it though.
[452.18s -> 454.18s]  Alright. Slow down.
[454.18s -> 456.18s]  I've already beat the damn game. Who cares?
[456.18s -> 458.87s]  Alright. Let's go. Let's go.
[458.87s -> 459.87s]  No more fucking around.
[459.87s -> 461.18s]  Just get up there.
[461.18s -> 462.18s]  He's addicted?
[462.18s -> 465.18s]  I mean the game is fucking incredibly fun to play.
[465.18s -> 467.18s]  Didn't I say I hated this game?
[467.18s -> 469.18s]  I talked about how I hated everything about this game.
[469.18s -> 473.66s]  I think I did that.
[473.66s -> 479.22s]  Show this to future Jeremy.
[479.22s -> 480.22s]  Let me see.
[480.22s -> 482.74s]  This is important.
[482.74s -> 485.82s]  I think I'm gonna go get that coin.
[485.82s -> 488.82s]  Can I like fucking scoop slam him and take over his place?
[488.82s -> 489.82s]  I don't understand.
[489.82s -> 500.53s]  Like I don't care if I'm the new Jeremy.
[500.53s -> 503.53s]  Jeremy, if you're listening to me in the future, just come do it and be the Jeremy.
[503.53s -> 504.53s]  That's fine.
[504.53s -> 509.39s]  I don't get it.
[509.39s -> 513.27s]  I am me. I am the future me.
[513.27s -> 514.27s]  What's he talking about?
[514.27s -> 518.11s]  I don't get it.
[518.11s -> 523.10s]  I just need to get to the DLC and save the game.
[523.10s -> 525.10s]  And then I'll never open the game again.
[525.10s -> 526.10s]  I will never open this game again.
[526.10s -> 529.10s]  I just have to get to the DLC and then turn it off.
[529.10s -> 530.10s]  Alright. Let's go.
[530.10s -> 551.50s]  Oops.
[551.50s -> 554.60s]  Alright. Let's do it.
[554.60s -> 559.04s]  Alright. Is that a full jump?
[559.04s -> 561.88s]  I don't remember.
[561.88s -> 562.88s]  It's been a while.
[562.88s -> 567.19s]  It is. Okay.
[567.19s -> 568.19s]  Okay.
[568.19s -> 574.81s]  Just get into the DLC.
[574.81s -> 593.44s]  Not a big deal.
[593.44s -> 594.44s]  Don't worry.
[594.44s -> 595.44s]  It's not a big deal.
[595.44s -> 596.44s]  Not a big deal.
[596.44s -> 597.44s]  That's the first time.
[597.44s -> 612.70s]  Oh, God.
[612.70s -> 613.70s]  I've attempted that before.
[613.70s -> 624.74s]  It's the first time I've attempted that in a long time.
[624.74s -> 637.71s]  I haven't attempted that in a long time, guys.
[637.71s -> 638.71s]  Fix the stream name.
[638.71s -> 642.90s]  This is not a Jump King stream.
[642.90s -> 643.90s]  I don't need to change the title.
[643.90s -> 645.46s]  I'm just sampling.
[645.46s -> 646.46s]  Don't.
[646.46s -> 647.46s]  Okay.
[647.46s -> 658.94s]  I have stuff talking.
[658.94s -> 659.94s]  Alright.
[659.94s -> 660.94s]  Fucking I'll change the title name.
[660.94s -> 661.94s]  Fine.
[661.94s -> 662.94s]  Jeez.
[662.94s -> 663.94s]  Alright.
[663.94s -> 664.94s]  Here we go.
[664.94s -> 671.69s]  Title name is just testing out the DLC.
[671.69s -> 674.69s]  And then that's it.
[674.69s -> 675.69s]  Is it Jump King?
[675.69s -> 676.69s]  Does it say Jump King?
[676.69s -> 694.44s]  What are you talking about?
[694.44s -> 696.00s]  We're good?
[696.00s -> 697.00s]  Time for the DLC.
[697.00s -> 698.00s]  Let's go.
[698.00s -> 699.00s]  I'll try it once.
[699.00s -> 700.00s]  Just to look at it.
[700.00s -> 701.00s]  I just want to test it.
[701.00s -> 706.91s]  Okay.
[706.91s -> 707.91s]  Let's test out the DLC.
[707.91s -> 708.91s]  Just give it a look.
[708.91s -> 721.22s]  Okay.
[721.22s -> 722.22s]  Let's give it a look.
[722.22s -> 732.59s]  Let's just give it a quick little look.
[732.59s -> 741.49s]  Let me get right here.
[741.49s -> 743.62s]  Looks good.
[743.62s -> 745.62s]  Just give it a look.
[745.62s -> 746.62s]  Okay.
[746.62s -> 748.62s]  Let him look bad.
[748.62s -> 750.62s]  Looks pretty good.
[750.62s -> 752.57s]  Alright.
[752.57s -> 762.13s]  Cool.
[762.13s -> 763.62s]  Easy.
[763.62s -> 767.55s]  This way, right?
[767.55s -> 768.98s]  Yep.
[768.98s -> 769.98s]  Give it a look.
[769.98s -> 771.98s]  I remember I did a little bit of this.
[771.98s -> 785.13s]  A little bit more.
[785.13s -> 786.13s]  Just give it a look.
[786.13s -> 789.88s]  Just a fun little six hour look.
[789.88s -> 791.88s]  I'm not going to do that guys.
[791.88s -> 794.21s]  Alright.
[794.21s -> 795.21s]  I gotta slow down.
[795.21s -> 809.76s]  It's just.
[809.76s -> 810.76s]  Alright.
[810.76s -> 811.76s]  I'm good.
[811.76s -> 812.76s]  We're fine.
[812.76s -> 813.76s]  Everyone just relax.
[813.76s -> 814.76s]  Have a good New Year.
[814.76s -> 816.76s]  Hope you had a good New Year's Eve.
[816.76s -> 824.98s]  Okay.
[824.98s -> 825.98s]  We're back.
[825.98s -> 826.98s]  Good.
[826.98s -> 827.98s]  Bro.
[827.98s -> 829.79s]  2020 sucks.
[829.79s -> 830.79s]  I'm sorry.
[830.79s -> 831.79s]  I'm really sorry to hear that.
[831.79s -> 842.12s]  Hopefully 2020 gets better.
[842.12s -> 843.12s]  Oops.
[843.12s -> 844.12s]  I didn't see.
[844.12s -> 850.93s]  I didn't know they had a top.
[850.93s -> 851.93s]  Get birdy.
[851.93s -> 854.51s]  You're going to lose.
[854.51s -> 856.46s]  That's not true.
[856.46s -> 857.46s]  Is that true?
[857.46s -> 858.46s]  Wait.
[858.46s -> 869.73s]  Stop getting in my head.
[869.73s -> 870.73s]  Fuck.
[870.73s -> 871.73s]  God damn it.
[871.73s -> 872.73s]  You're still streaming this shit.
[872.73s -> 873.73s]  No.
[873.73s -> 874.73s]  I'm not.
[874.73s -> 875.73s]  This is not a real stream.
[875.73s -> 876.73s]  It's not a real stream.
[876.73s -> 877.73s]  This is a.
[877.73s -> 882.73s]  I'm just trying to test out what I think about the DLC content.
[882.73s -> 886.18s]  If this was a real stream, you would know.
[886.18s -> 894.70s]  Because I'd be like, you know.
[894.70s -> 895.70s]  Yeah, I tested it.
[895.70s -> 896.70s]  I did.
[896.70s -> 899.66s]  Yeah.
[899.66s -> 900.66s]  And it's fine.
[900.66s -> 908.18s]  It seems like it's pretty cool.
[908.18s -> 909.18s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[909.18s -> 910.18s]  No, I just want to fucking test it.
[910.18s -> 911.18s]  I just want to.
[911.18s -> 912.18s]  I just want to test it.
[912.18s -> 931.40s]  I am sort.
[931.40s -> 933.60s]  I'm kind of in the zone with the game at the moment, though.
[933.60s -> 934.80s]  I will tell you.
[934.80s -> 946.84s]  What?
[946.84s -> 947.84s]  No, stop distracting me.
[947.84s -> 948.84s]  Don't distract me.
[948.84s -> 949.84s]  Why are you distracting me like this?
[949.84s -> 962.09s]  Why?
[962.09s -> 963.09s]  Stop distracting me.
[963.09s -> 970.22s]  Everyone's distracting me.
[970.22s -> 971.22s]  Stop.
[971.22s -> 972.22s]  Just don't distract me.
[972.22s -> 983.30s]  Fuck.
[983.30s -> 984.30s]  OK.
[984.30s -> 987.84s]  People are distracting me.
[987.84s -> 988.84s]  I got to turn.
[988.84s -> 989.84s]  OK.
[989.84s -> 1005.80s]  You know what I got to do?
[1005.80s -> 1006.80s]  I got to turn on.
[1006.80s -> 1007.80s]  Slow down.
[1007.80s -> 1009.23s]  I got here before.
[1009.23s -> 1010.23s]  I've been here before.
[1010.23s -> 1011.23s]  Emote only?
[1011.23s -> 1018.04s]  No.
[1018.04s -> 1019.04s]  I just have to stop looking over the screen.
[1019.04s -> 1034.10s]  I forgot there was ice in the video game.
[1034.10s -> 1035.10s]  All right.
[1035.10s -> 1047.42s]  We're good.
[1047.42s -> 1048.42s]  That's a pretty good test.
[1048.42s -> 1051.96s]  Not a bad test.
[1051.96s -> 1052.96s]  Close the game now.
[1052.96s -> 1054.33s]  No, it's all good.
[1054.33s -> 1055.33s]  I'm all right.
[1055.33s -> 1068.47s]  I just want to keep testing some things.
[1068.47s -> 1069.47s]  Don't go that far.
[1069.47s -> 1077.88s]  I got to go shorter than that.
[1077.88s -> 1097.38s]  I went fucking around when I told you guys I was like, dreamed about this game.
[1097.38s -> 1102.71s]  What?
[1102.71s -> 1103.71s]  Come on.
[1103.71s -> 1107.45s]  I can do this.
[1107.45s -> 1108.45s]  What time is it?
[1108.45s -> 1109.45s]  It's 11 o'clock?
[1109.45s -> 1110.45s]  It's not that late.
[1110.45s -> 1115.08s]  Oh, my God.
[1115.08s -> 1116.08s]  What did I do that for?
[1116.08s -> 1121.16s]  Oh, my God.
[1121.16s -> 1123.36s]  Oh, my God.
[1123.36s -> 1124.36s]  Oh, my God.
[1124.36s -> 1125.36s]  Oh, my God.
[1125.36s -> 1126.36s]  Oh, my God.
[1126.36s -> 1127.36s]  All right.
[1127.36s -> 1132.70s]  You guys are distracting me.
[1132.70s -> 1134.70s]  You guys are distracting the fuck out of me.
[1134.70s -> 1136.70s]  Everyone's just yelling my name and shit.
[1136.70s -> 1139.98s]  I'm in trouble now.
[1139.98s -> 1140.98s]  OK.
[1140.98s -> 1153.74s]  Here we go.
[1153.74s -> 1156.07s]  All right.
[1156.07s -> 1161.73s]  We're fine.
[1161.73s -> 1166.55s]  I'm back.
[1166.55s -> 1168.43s]  There we go.
[1168.43s -> 1169.43s]  OK.
[1169.43s -> 1181.55s]  Thank you for the non-distractions.
[1181.55s -> 1188.49s]  I appreciate it.
[1188.49s -> 1191.26s]  All right.
[1191.26s -> 1192.44s]  We're good.
[1192.44s -> 1193.44s]  What time is it?
[1193.44s -> 1194.44s]  It's been six hours.
[1194.44s -> 1195.94s]  It's not like...
[1195.94s -> 1196.94s]  You guys act like it's been 30 hours.
[1196.94s -> 1197.94s]  It's only been like six hours.
[1197.94s -> 1204.36s]  All right.
[1204.36s -> 1205.36s]  Not too crazy here.
[1205.36s -> 1206.36s]  There we go.
[1206.36s -> 1207.92s]  All right.
[1207.92s -> 1208.92s]  What's up here?
[1208.92s -> 1210.29s]  What should I do about this?
[1210.29s -> 1211.29s]  Bounce off this wall?
[1211.29s -> 1213.30s]  Wait.
[1213.30s -> 1214.30s]  No.
[1214.30s -> 1214.32s]  From here.
