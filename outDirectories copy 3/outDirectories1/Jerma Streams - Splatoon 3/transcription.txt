[2.42s -> 7.05s]  Hey, what's up? Sorry, I'm late. I had to come up with a funny title.
[9.82s -> 15.34s]  I'm sitting here going, I gotta think of a funny title. And I came up with one. I came up with one.
[15.90s -> 25.86s]  You think it's kind of funny? Okay, 15 minutes. Yeah, I've got to come up with a title.
[26.58s -> 48.57s]  I thought it was VR Josh. Nah, nah, nah, nah. Yeah, it was. What the hell is going on right now?
[49.21s -> 55.11s]  What is this? Why is there a purple box over people's messages? What is this?
[61.85s -> 71.16s]  First time chat. What is this? I don't want this. How do I delete this? Immediately. I want to delete
[71.16s -> 81.85s]  this immediately. Are the edibles kicking in? No, dude. All right, fucking stop. Since I turned 37,
[82.65s -> 88.55s]  it's been nothing but weirdo streams. I have to stop being weird. I'm going to say I'm going to be
[88.55s -> 98.63s]  fucking quiet for the next hour. But no, it's a new chat appearance.
[100.76s -> 104.44s]  Why do you sound like you don't like the real German? Well, it's because I'm a little winded
[104.44s -> 114.44s]  because I was running around the house. I was okay. You know that you're late for something
[115.08s -> 119.48s]  when you start taking corners in your own place. You don't know you understand that.
[122.98s -> 138.02s]  But I'm taking corners. I had to get my tea. My tea wasn't even ready. Why were you running?
[138.58s -> 152.81s]  I'll be fine. Just give me a minute. You made us weird. Sad. What? Don't you guys understand
[152.81s -> 159.82s]  that? You come observe me. You don't want to be like me. Come observe me. Be like,
[159.82s -> 179.75s]  I don't want to be like that guy. I'm going to do good in school. Observe. How are you? I'm
[179.75s -> 186.25s]  doing good. I'm doing good. Sorry we delayed a couple of days, but you know what happened.
[190.98s -> 195.70s]  Actually, we should go over this because it's important. So today we're going to stream here.
[195.70s -> 204.41s]  Listen, we're going to do Splatoon three. And then after that, Breath of the Wild.
[207.70s -> 221.86s]  And then on Sunday, we'll take a break from the switch. Why did you delay? I woke up on
[221.86s -> 227.88s]  the wrong side of the bed the last couple of days and I was like, nah, I just take care of
[227.88s -> 233.67s]  a few things too. All right. I literally ran around. Can I just let me just not be winded
[233.67s -> 241.50s]  for one second. Listen to this voice. What's going on? No, I had to. There were some things
[241.50s -> 251.64s]  I had to take care of. What is going on with my voice? I promise you it was not like this
[251.64s -> 261.99s]  five minutes ago. So what's the story Sunday? I don't know. I want to get away from the switch
[261.99s -> 272.89s]  for a little bit though. Is it allergy season? It actually might be. Did you hear that? I just fake
[272.89s -> 281.51s]  sniffed. You just implanted that in my head. Did you hear that? I hope you did. Did that come
[281.51s -> 295.83s]  through? I was like, oh, you know, maybe, maybe, um, he's allergic to streaming now. All right.
[295.83s -> 310.63s]  Yeah. We're going to play Splatoon three. Let me tweet though. That's good. Okay. Um, I
[311.51s -> 317.21s]  don't really know how to play Splatoon. It started with motion controls and I turned that off.
[324.17s -> 328.98s]  I did the tutorial and I made my squid here. Look, I'll just show you whatever.
[337.02s -> 345.98s]  Apparently this you can make different. Um, hold on. Can you guys hear it? There we are.
[345.98s -> 350.78s]  I don't, I don't know. I don't know how any of this works. This is, this is my character
[351.50s -> 373.99s]  and this is, uh, are these players? Are they? They are. Okay. How's that? Wait. So this,
[373.99s -> 396.33s]  this is a player right here. Why, why are they NPCs? It's not in real time. Uh, okay. Okay.
[396.33s -> 404.60s]  All right. So, so where do I go? I took them. I took off. I don't want to do motion controls.
[404.60s -> 414.14s]  I don't want to do it. I'll be okay. Let me be very, very upfront with everybody. Um,
[414.78s -> 422.01s]  I installed Splatoon three and made this character and then never opened it again.
[422.65s -> 428.36s]  God, it's, it's had to have been at least three weeks. It's had to have been at least two weeks,
[428.36s -> 438.04s]  at least I don't, I have no idea. All right. Go to the menu. Lobby stages. Oh, okay. Regular
[438.04s -> 459.91s]  battle. Anarchy battle. What's salmon run? Turn on drawings. You coward story mode to salmon run.
[459.91s -> 468.39s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. How do I do this? I should do this right now. No, this is definitely like
[468.39s -> 478.68s]  hard mode. I'm not doing hard mode right now. All right. Let's just do lobby. How do we look
[478.68s -> 489.46s]  plastic today? I'm, I mean, I don't feel plastic. Welcome to the lobby. It's your portal to online
[489.46s -> 495.05s]  battles and where you stash all your gear. As you splat forth and online battles, you'll level up
[495.05s -> 502.63s]  and earn cash. Why level up and get cash? So you can access a gear and some battle modes are
[502.63s -> 510.97s]  restricted to players at a higher level. Okay. Why don't you check out the battle pot? Okay.
[511.61s -> 521.96s]  Less chat, more splat. That's what I mean. Oh, when you play online, your nickname and player
[521.96s -> 537.96s]  data may be made public. All right. That's about this way. Okay. That's those taunts. Listen,
[537.96s -> 541.88s]  let me just do a regular fight. I'm going to be the literally bottom, uh, bragging person,
[541.88s -> 556.76s]  but that's fine. Okay. Bro, what's your haircut? Uh, the haircut is a 37 year old man that has not
[556.76s -> 564.50s]  been to the hair salon in two and a half months. That's it. And sometimes shaves, sometimes shaves.
[567.61s -> 582.87s]  All right, let's go. Both headphones in. Which one is me? You, that's me. I don't know how to play.
[582.87s -> 591.45s]  I actually don't know how to play. Is there a sprint? Okay. That's how do I, how do I, um,
[591.45s -> 603.77s]  how do you do the squid move when you jump in the, in the squidding? Oh yeah. First frag.
[623.22s -> 633.08s]  Do I have to like paint the ground? What? Well, you can hide. Okay. All right.
[633.64s -> 672.62s]  There's different weapon loadouts too. What's that? Oh, grenade. I think I'm doing okay. Am I
[672.62s -> 678.84s]  doing good? Is that a player? Who is that? All right. Shoot the ink, the ground, shoot the ground,
[678.84s -> 711.56s]  shoot the ground. Okay. Shoot the ground. I mean, the whole ground is green. What's up? What the
[711.56s -> 752.54s]  fuck is this crab? What the hell is that? Should I pick this up? What the fuck was that? Oh, is there
[752.54s -> 762.44s]  a healer? How do I check the stats? Press right stick. That was actually kind of fun.
[764.02s -> 773.94s]  That was actually pretty fun. I enjoyed that. That was fun. All right. So we lost. What happened?
[773.94s -> 788.46s]  That's the first time I've ever played the game. So it's only based on what's on the ground. That's
[788.46s -> 800.95s]  it. It was basically a three v four. Okay. In that mode. All right. That's what battles are like.
[801.51s -> 805.27s]  Hey, did you happen to notice how some of your opponents had cool looking name displays?
[806.01s -> 809.85s]  They're called splash tags and they're fully customizable to show off your personality.
[810.57s -> 816.66s]  Wait, you haven't even set up a nickname for your splash tag yet. You got to show up in style to
[816.66s -> 826.79s]  your next battle. What do you want to call yourself? Yeah, we'll see. I want it to be a reveal.
[826.79s -> 861.80s]  I don't want you guys to see it. What should I call myself? What's the objective? That's so bad.
[861.80s -> 874.86s]  That's the worst nickname I've ever seen. Is this permanent? Is it permanent or? All right. Hold on.
[877.29s -> 884.09s]  No. Okay. Okay. That's all right. You know, you can use the Sheldon license you got on shiny new
[884.09s -> 898.95s]  weapons. I can't wait to see what I did. Ammo Knights. Okay. Swap. Okay. Cool. So the whole
[898.95s -> 904.79s]  goal of Splatoon is you want to get more paint on the ground. Oh, this is cool. What's the range on
[904.79s -> 912.94s]  this shit? Let me hold on. Let me see something. All right. So this is a massive arc. So you
[912.94s -> 923.00s]  realistically need to be really close. LZ makes you fly around. That's also how you get more ink.
[923.00s -> 935.62s]  Right. Get a new weapon. Try the charger. All right. How do I? That's not my name. My name's
[935.62s -> 940.98s]  not Splattershot Jr. I know a lot of people before I think that. How do I buy a new weapon?
[940.98s -> 955.06s]  Let's go to the ammo shop, right? Grab a bite. Hello there. Welcome. This is your first time
[955.06s -> 970.54s]  here, isn't it? How splendid. I do hope you become a regular here at the Crab and Go. This voice is
[970.54s -> 981.61s]  stun locking me. I can't even think. What did it say? Crab? Crab sandwich. Battle? Okay. So this is
[981.61s -> 987.59s]  probably cost real money or something. It's like gumballs too. All right. So let me hold on.
[988.90s -> 991.78s]  You think it's to try a new weapon? Do I have enough money? Let me try. Let me do another match.
[991.78s -> 1001.56s]  Let me just get a feel for the game. Just regular battle. The story mode. I know. I will. I get all
[1001.56s -> 1013.99s]  day. What does it menu? Then ammo shop. All right. Well, hold on. Let me just play one more time.
[1028.18s -> 1035.08s]  I could be a bot. Try act like a bot. Just walk around like a World of Warcraft NPC.
[1036.04s -> 1054.92s]  All right. No, no, no, no, no. We're playing to win. What the hell was that? We just got hit
[1054.92s -> 1087.13s]  by a hammer. X is the map. Oh, shit. All right. Cool. Over the gank. Got it. Get that shit out of
[1087.13s -> 1120.78s]  here. Oh, shit. Right stick. Right stick. What does the right stick do? We're winning. Wait,
[1120.78s -> 1140.04s]  we got, we got, we're good. Right stick. Right stick has moved my camera, man. Sorry. R3. That's
[1140.04s -> 1159.66s]  what I'm... It doesn't do anything. Oh, bullshit. Press right stick when you have a special. Top
[1159.66s -> 1196.81s]  right is special. All right. Right stick. Here we go. Ready? What's it do? What does it do?
[1199.94s -> 1215.37s]  Come on. We get it. We're doing all right. It's a shield. We had to have won that one, right?
[1218.28s -> 1230.12s]  Yeah. 26 point. 40 point. What does that mean? We lost by 1%. All right. I want that roller. How
[1230.12s -> 1243.46s]  do I get that? I want the huge roller. It's a shield. All right. Turn motion controls on. I would,
[1243.46s -> 1258.14s]  I will throw up into my shirt if I do that. See, let's get it. I did fine. All right. So menu.
[1262.07s -> 1290.84s]  Weapons. I want the roller. Okay. Yeah. I didn't read any of that. All right. You get Sheldon
[1290.84s -> 1300.97s]  license by battling and leveling up or even just developing your skills by... All right. So I want
[1300.97s -> 1336.33s]  the roller. The splatter shot. This is actually locking up my head. Okay. So the Tri-Zuko. That's
[1336.33s -> 1347.99s]  what I want. I'm going to fucking destroy people with this thing. Ling ink or hold ZR. Curling bombs.
[1347.99s -> 1359.18s]  All right. No, don't buy that. I just want to skip the fucking lore. All right. I want this.
[1369.91s -> 1382.14s]  This looks fun. You can test it out. I feel like I'm playing as a... I feel like I have like a
[1382.14s -> 1395.30s]  dragon great sword in Dark Souls. Yeah. Oh, this thing's amazing. I feel like you can just get
[1395.30s -> 1399.66s]  killed really easily here though. All right. What does this, what does this do? Oh, you should
[1399.66s -> 1410.04s]  shoot it like a Roomba. Oh, all right. So that's, that's right bumper. What does left bumper do?
[1410.04s -> 1420.33s]  Anything? No. I guess. Holy shit. Is this the strategy? Isn't it? This is probably the strat.
[1422.89s -> 1446.54s]  That's the strat. Whoa. It is a dragon great sword. That's how you start every single fight.
[1446.54s -> 1460.25s]  All right. Jump special. And what does this thing do? This is just a shield. Okay. Let me try the
[1460.25s -> 1470.65s]  other thing too. How do I get out of here? My game's bugged. My game's bugged. I can't leave.
[1470.65s -> 1484.50s]  My game's bugged. Let's try this. So how does this one work? Okay. I could, this definitely needs
[1484.50s -> 1489.98s]  motion controls. Otherwise you end up doing the thing where you play every console FPS,
[1489.98s -> 1499.18s]  where you go like this. The target's right there. I'd like to shoot that person. Not happening.
[1499.18s -> 1514.30s]  It's a cool weapon though. I like the grenade better. Try out the gyro controls with it. Let
[1514.30s -> 1524.44s]  me see. I don't think I can do it right now. Can I test anything else? Oh, I can. What's this thing?
[1524.44s -> 1543.86s]  This thing kind of sucks. That range is awful. Is this supposed to be like a shotgun? Actually,
[1544.42s -> 1567.86s]  nevermind. This is cool. It's in the other settings. Okay. Let me try this. Bro,
[1567.86s -> 1579.21s]  no fucking way. How does anybody do this? I feel like when a 70 year old lady, a 70 year old woman
[1579.21s -> 1583.21s]  was handed a Wiimote for the first time and she'd never play a game before in her entire life.
[1583.21s -> 1596.52s]  That's how this feels to me. How do you turn? Oh no, no, no. It's not, this is fine, right?
[1596.52s -> 1603.10s]  Up and down vertical is fine, but it's the going side to side and having the right stick too.
[1603.10s -> 1628.39s]  This is no way this isn't going to happen. Actually, hold on a minute. Actually. So should
[1628.39s -> 1648.33s]  I be using the right stick at all? Press Y to reset. Oh, it's weird. Let me try the sniper with
[1648.33s -> 1671.54s]  this. I mean, it's way better, but like it sucks at the same time. It's still weird though. It's
[1671.54s -> 1686.26s]  the side to side motion that's still fucking me up. Be the worst sniper ever. Change the sensitivity
[1686.26s -> 1708.92s]  on it. I just tried to do it with the, okay, sensitivity higher. I mean, it's better for aiming,
[1708.92s -> 1720.82s]  but it still makes me want to puke. Lower is easier to get used to. I changed it. That's good.
[1720.82s -> 1726.14s]  Look, sensitivity and motion. I did it. I, this was down here. I put it up. This was the controller
[1726.14s -> 1731.05s]  sensitivity. I don't want that to be high. This is where I wanted it. I'll try it like this. All
[1731.05s -> 1737.18s]  right. I'm going to try the sniper. I'm going to try it with motion controls. No, I like it high.
[1737.18s -> 1754.14s]  Are you going to handheld? No, but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If I'm just going to be,
[1754.14s -> 1763.90s]  if I'm going to be Roller Andy, then why would I even care? Let me be, let me go back to,
[1763.90s -> 1773.37s]  hold on, because this isn't going to be, I don't like this. No, no way. Yeah. I'll try that later.
[1773.37s -> 1784.81s]  This makes way more sense in my brain. Let me just get used to the game like this. Okay, leave.
[1784.81s -> 1813.54s]  Okay. All right. Let me get it. So I got a roller. I'm ready. Roller main. I mean, yeah. Maybe a
[1813.54s -> 1828.49s]  little. Okay. So this is cool. Let's go to the lobby. Split joy cons are actually better for
[1828.49s -> 1865.78s]  this game. Really? What's this? Get advice. Is it a cat? No. Oh, here we go. I'm going to top frag
[1865.78s -> 1885.74s]  now. Motion controls are better. Yeah. Maybe this is my third game ever on Splatoon. I've played as
[1885.74s -> 1895.99s]  many games in Splatoon as there have been releases of this series. So let me get used to the game.
[1896.07s -> 1924.33s]  Go. This is my job, right? Oh yeah. We're going to do dual coats. That's right.
[1925.61s -> 1969.05s]  What happened here? I'm going to make sure we're covered. Every little percent counts.
[1969.05s -> 1980.71s]  You've seen it every time we've played. Does that mean that somebody died there
[1980.71s -> 2033.85s]  on my team? Sorry. I was tank. Come on. They wiped us out. I have a special. You're right.
[2033.85s -> 2040.07s]  Fuck. I keep forgetting. How do I die there? What do you mean just happened?
[2067.90s -> 2080.22s]  Out of ink. What? That's going to be the game changer right there.
[2084.02s -> 2095.21s]  Nevermind. We lost by a lot. Holy shit. We got destroyed. Learn how to spawn on your teammates.
[2095.21s -> 2107.86s]  How do you do that? This was a three V four. It was. That's not fair. Press X when you respawn.
[2107.86s -> 2118.84s]  I like the roller. Oh, somebody DC'd. All right. That makes sense. The arrow thing was a teammate
[2118.84s -> 2139.29s]  jumping to you. Oh, okay. Rollers are fun. You know, I wrote this game off and thought it was dumb.
[2139.29s -> 2152.95s]  That's my mistake for like the last five years. Splatoon one came out. I was like, nah,
[2152.95s -> 2160.06s]  Splatoon two. Didn't even know it released. Splatoon three. Where have I been all this time?
[2160.70s -> 2165.51s]  What was I doing? Oh, it's because I was on the Wii U and that was an unbelievably awful experience.
[2165.51s -> 2175.54s]  Now I remember. I wrote the whole series off because the Wii U existed. All right,
[2175.54s -> 2183.93s]  I'll get this. We go. I helped. I'll get this corner. I get this corner. You get that one.
[2184.57s -> 2198.65s]  Somebody ulting. You're going to be real disappointed when you realize that I was
[2198.65s -> 2206.23s]  back here cleaning up your mess. That felt like an ad. That felt like I was on TV doing an ad.
[2217.16s -> 2262.12s]  I got it. No, I didn't. And then right after. Splatoon three. Coming soon. Yeah. All right.
[2262.12s -> 2283.51s]  How do I spawn on teammates? Is it X? Oh, shit. Okay. Like that. It worked. Why can't I jump up here?
[2283.51s -> 2327.78s]  I just got a fucking pentakill, I think. Am I doing all right? Oh, there's no way we're losing,
[2327.78s -> 2355.50s]  right? I got a little bit. All right. I got it. There it is. You can jump to anybody at any time.
[2355.50s -> 2375.38s]  Really? That's cool. I can see your circle. I mean, my circle. Let's get it. And my eyes.
[2375.38s -> 2385.98s]  You can see my eyes. You can also jump back to spawn. Oh, yes. All right. Wait, wait, wait.
[2385.98s -> 2393.96s]  How does story mode work? How do I do this? Should I do one more? I have to piss so fucking bad.
[2393.96s -> 2487.35s]  I'm sorry. It's been like 20 minutes. I'll be right back. Two seconds. Okay. I'm back. I've been.
[2487.35s -> 2498.74s]  I've been just slamming fucking teas and water. Did you wash your hands? Of course I did. What
[2498.74s -> 2507.06s]  do you mean? What happened to the BRB music? Yeah. I don't know why I got disconnected from
[2507.06s -> 2514.81s]  my scream deck thing. I want to do one more. Can I do one? I'm going to do one more and then I will
[2515.53s -> 2520.98s]  do some other stuff. Let me do one more. I'm just barely getting the hang of the game.
[2520.98s -> 2537.72s]  Talk to the cat. Fresh meter in the match. When you measure your performance,
[2538.36s -> 2542.49s]  when you win, the meter goes up. But if you lose a turf or battle, it drops.
[2543.67s -> 2550.31s]  Meter also changes the color of the flag by each weapon. Use the fresh meter to see your personal
[2550.31s -> 2564.70s]  records for each weapon. I mean, that's cool. Private battle. I don't think I could even do
[2564.70s -> 2579.80s]  this yet. Turn on the gyro. No, not right now. I really don't like motion controls.
[2583.72s -> 2591.96s]  So this the when I press in the right stick, it makes a shield around me. It's a big shield
[2591.96s -> 2660.95s]  for the team. OK. Is there a double jump? Stop. Oh, fuck off. I thought I was going to go further
[2660.95s -> 2668.58s]  than that. What's this? What's this fucking weapon this person has? What was that? What was that
[2668.58s -> 2693.94s]  thing? Why don't I have what is this fucking hammer? Oh, we're in so much trouble here.
[2707.58s -> 2775.08s]  What are these kill streaks like Call of Duty kill streaks landing on us?
[2775.08s -> 2791.29s]  Where is this motherfucker? Holy shit. Use your ult. We didn't get to play the game.
[2791.29s -> 2835.93s]  Can I move the ult indicator to like in the middle of the screen? I feel like I just don't
[2835.93s -> 2843.94s]  know when this happens. I feel like I have to look at where the face cam is. When it fills up,
[2843.94s -> 2858.49s]  I want it to be like, whoa, your ult is ready. Can I mod the game to do that? Try a different
[2858.49s -> 2873.67s]  weapon. I will. It already does do that. It does that. Your hair glows. Oh, shit. That's
[2873.67s -> 2886.63s]  what that means. All right. Hold on. I thought I had like a buff from a teammate. All right.
[2886.63s -> 2972.82s]  We're going to win this one. Group up on me. I thought it happened again. I was like, oh shit.
[2972.82s -> 2976.10s]  All right. Well, I'm glad that happened in the very beginning and not at the very end.
[2981.42s -> 2987.38s]  I started to understand the game. So as a roller, should I do what I'm doing? Is this
[2988.10s -> 2992.18s]  am I helping? Is this what I should be doing? Don't go right to like the front lines. Just
[2992.18s -> 2996.86s]  do some painting and shit, right? That's what I'm supposed to be doing, right?
[3000.10s -> 3005.99s]  I mean, it makes sense that this is what I should be doing. Oh, this is my favorite song.
[3006.63s -> 3010.82s]  Oh, you on the wall. You know the one, the lyrics that go like this.
[3011.70s -> 3081.70s]  Can we not even kill the AFK player? Are you dropping here? I know what that means now.
[3110.79s -> 3133.51s]  Why am I going to kill him in one hit? What? It's killing me in one hit.
[3158.01s -> 3181.99s]  Oh, I got to go back to the other weapon. I'm switching. I'm switching weapons.
[3181.99s -> 3208.95s]  Did I actually scream in your ears? I'm sorry. Give me the default. I feel like I was doing
[3208.95s -> 3232.73s]  better with this. Buy a new one. I need another. I want one of those alts that drops a fucking bunch
[3232.73s -> 3262.39s]  of grenades on everybody. Play to level four. Every weapon has a different loadout. The roller was,
[3262.39s -> 3299.06s]  you know what I mean? Oh, let's go. Watch this. What the fuck was that?
[3324.50s -> 3350.92s]  Oh, what's that? What's that?
[3435.70s -> 3451.94s]  I looked over thinking I was going to see like Omega Lulz and it's just all monkey ass.
[3455.58s -> 3464.52s]  I was like, oh, they're going to think that's funny. It's like, holy shit. Everyone's like,
[3464.52s -> 3487.94s]  what the fuck was that? This is what Splatoon will do to a motherfucker. All right. Hold on.
[3487.94s -> 3508.28s]  One more. I had to go all in. I did it once and I'm like, all right, that song has that happened
[3508.28s -> 3514.97s]  twice. I got to go all in. That was a Tasmanian devil moment. I was like, I got to go all in.
[3522.81s -> 3538.55s]  What song? That's what I, that's what I was doing. What are you talking about?
[3538.55s -> 3549.61s]  That's not what it sounded like. It was, it didn't wait. You guys did not know. That's what I was.
[3549.61s -> 3562.22s]  What? That makes it even funnier for me. That makes it way better. I'm so happy.
[3562.94s -> 3608.86s]  Double shield. What's that mean? What's this mean? What's that thing mean? It sounded like
[3608.86s -> 3637.02s]  Woody Woodpecker. No way. No way. I should have. I'm an idiot. What the hell was that?
[3637.58s -> 3733.77s]  I need ink. Shit. Got it. Oh, come on, man. We may have lost. Yeah, we lost. By a lot.
[3736.23s -> 3740.52s]  Somebody called me an idiot. For what? If you use your special, it refills your ink.
[3741.32s -> 3748.20s]  Fucking idiot. I didn't know that. Man, I'm learning how to play the game.
[3749.16s -> 3761.19s]  I want to hear the Woody Woodpecker. Can I hear it? Do we have a clip? Hold on. I need to hear
[3761.19s -> 3780.73s]  because I was doing the Splatoon theme song. Does anybody have a clip? Oh, is that not the
[3780.73s -> 3795.02s]  theme song? I'm trying to understand how you don't know that. That's the Splatoon theme song. I was
[3795.02s -> 3801.19s]  so accurate. That was like perfect. People saying, oh, that wasn't even close. Yes, it was.
[3803.00s -> 3814.18s]  God damn it. All right. I have to play one without the headphones on. Woody Woodpecker is
[3814.90s -> 3842.90s]  a-ha-ha-ha. That was ha-ha-ha-ha. You got it wrong. It's coming up. The volume is coming out of my
[3842.90s -> 3848.36s]  speakers here. All right. This is the one. And then I promise after this, I will stop and I
[3848.36s -> 3885.77s]  will do story mode for at least 10 minutes. Good. Control the middle. Control mid. Make them way up.
[3910.26s -> 3935.03s]  That was a pretty good life. It was all right. Oh my God. That was a fucking explosive.
[3949.94s -> 3958.34s]  Too much going on. All right. We're actually starting to lose pretty bad now.
[3978.20s -> 4006.52s]  Shit. Oh my God. My ultimate. I had it right at the end. All right. I got the yelp off.
[4006.52s -> 4036.50s]  Just go, go, go, go. We only have 20 seconds. All right. All right. I mean, we got dominated,
[4036.50s -> 4076.02s]  but that's fine. Oh my goodness. We didn't even play. You're actually so bad. Okay. I'm going to
[4076.02s -> 4088.42s]  go to the store. I was number one on the team by almost twice. There are a few shops around here
[4088.42s -> 4114.36s]  with gear. Okay. I have a store now. So what about head gear? I got 10 grand. We sell stuff
[4114.36s -> 4129.37s]  that you wear on your head, you know, like hats. They've got gear abilities. Okay. Quick super jump.
[4129.37s -> 4136.71s]  Run speed up. Come back. What's that? Boost some of your abilities for a short time after respawning.
[4137.27s -> 4155.08s]  Quick respawn. All right. Well, this is why I didn't have any of these. Reduce damage taken
[4155.08s -> 4162.44s]  and improves mobility when walking through enemy ink. That's actually pretty good. This is the only
[4163.24s -> 4172.39s]  clothing. These are the only pieces of head gear you have. All right. I'm buying it.
[4172.39s -> 4186.58s]  So I'm going to put the umpire mask on. Okay. I can unlock some stuff. The slosher. Oh, this is the
[4186.58s -> 4213.74s]  pail of ink. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Dual welding pistol type weapons that let's be honest look
[4213.74s -> 4225.64s]  pretty sweet. All right. That actually looks really cool. I want it. I have this dodge roll.
[4225.64s -> 4230.70s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. Too much info. Too much info. Too much info. I'll
[4230.70s -> 4242.18s]  just go play with it in the uh in like the platoon room. Sprinkler. Okay. Cool. Yep. All right.
[4242.18s -> 4259.30s]  Okay. All right. I'm just gonna I'm gonna go play. Did any I went did one person um actually sit
[4259.30s -> 4271.99s]  there and listen to that whole thing? All right. I want to try the slosher. So how does this work?
[4271.99s -> 4288.87s]  Yeah. This thing's crazy. This thing can have. All right. So I gotta explain this to me. Why
[4288.87s -> 4296.94s]  would you use the roller brush? This thing has more surface area. Just go like this. Actually,
[4296.94s -> 4321.80s]  maybe not. Twister time. That's amazing. Different rolls for different weapons. Okay. I kind of like
[4321.80s -> 4368.23s]  it. There's three twisters. Really? It's time to get used to the motion controls. Yeah. I don't like
[4368.23s -> 4374.90s]  it but it's just way more effective. I'll actually be actually hitting things. All right. I want to
[4374.90s -> 4390.33s]  try the other thing. I got dual pistols, right? It's kind of like the default weapon but better.
[4390.33s -> 4428.78s]  Sticky. Oh, it's like a sticky bomb. They're good. B is dodge roll. B is jump. How do I do it? B while
[4428.78s -> 4441.91s]  shooting. I mean this is incredible. All right. I'm thinking that's probably the best one I like
[4441.91s -> 4464.63s]  so far. What about this? Big staff. This runs out of ink really fast. This is all about burst. You
[4464.63s -> 4469.98s]  got a group up here. If there's a group. Let's say there's two or three people. You just go.
[4469.98s -> 4480.62s]  That's what kept killing me before. Whoa. Yeah. Somebody would just walk up and go
[4480.62s -> 4495.29s]  and three of us would die. All right. What's the uh. Okay. I have to sit back for this.
[4495.29s -> 4515.88s]  For this to make any sense. Okay. I have to have. This has not been plugged in for about
[4515.88s -> 4555.58s]  20 straight minutes. Hold on. We didn't hear. You guys did not hear that. Too close. I don't
[4555.58s -> 4571.27s]  get it. We heard the end a little bit. Oh, I was doing that. This is plugged in now. All right.
[4571.27s -> 4593.24s]  I'm ready. I'm ready to do a few more. I feel like the crossbow is going to be fun. Oh my goodness.
[4593.24s -> 4616.30s]  That goes far. The trajectory on these bullets are weird. Clean the room. Clean your room.
[4616.30s -> 4658.38s]  Bloody fire. I definitely want this eventually. Oh, a sprinkler. I like that. Cool. All right.
[4658.38s -> 4674.74s]  So what am I going to buy? What am I buying? Do the ult. Make waves. That's what this thing was.
[4674.74s -> 4687.21s]  This game's cool. I like it. All right. What am I doing? Should I use the heavy thing?
[4687.21s -> 4701.82s]  Paintbrush seems really good. I'll do splat uh. Splat dualies I think. Dodge roll seems too good.
[4701.82s -> 4710.97s]  Now what about other gear? You can buy two things. I don't know what I want though.
[4710.97s -> 4727.42s]  I don't want to spend. I don't know what I want yet. All right. What do you got? Respawn
[4727.42s -> 4737.80s]  Punisher. Okay. That's actually pretty good. Super jump speed. How do you do a super jump?
[4743.50s -> 4771.78s]  That seems good too. Should I buy this other stuff? Somebody said this resets daily.
[4771.78s -> 4785.05s]  Will I lose out on this? Don't worry about it. It resets in 30 minutes. Should I buy anything?
[4785.05s -> 4790.68s]  It'll come back eventually. Okay. Well, whatever. So that's my shirt. Is there pants or anything?
[4790.68s -> 4819.93s]  Okay. Weapons. Clothing. Shoes. Special power up. Oops. Hides your super jump landing point.
[4819.93s -> 4839.88s]  That seems good. That seems good. Damage taken. That seems good. I think it's this one. Stealth
[4839.88s -> 4856.78s]  jump is S tier. I feel like it's this one. Yeah. Anything else I can buy before I get back in?
[4856.78s -> 4878.23s]  General? You're tacky. General? Hey, welcome to Atlantis. I don't really work here but you can
[4878.23s -> 4883.86s]  shop around and I'll sell you stuff. Put it in your locker I guess. It's all pretty random.
[4883.86s -> 4887.94s]  Your locker's in the locker room. Duh. You can go look at it later. Anything in there? I guess
[4887.94s -> 4904.81s]  it's yours by default. Okay. What are these like stickers? All right. Oh, you can customize your
[4904.81s -> 4952.50s]  banner. All right. Sure. Should I get a sports comic? What should I buy? What do I do with this?
[4952.50s -> 4965.45s]  That's kind of a cool mechanic. Customize your locker. All right. Let's go to the locker.
[4965.45s -> 5006.92s]  Is it in the lobby? Cool. Okay. Edit splash tag. It's to your right. Oh, there it is. Okay.
[5006.92s -> 5035.88s]  Welcome to the locker room. Cool. Okay. That one's yours. These are other players' lockers? Okay.
[5035.88s -> 5059.38s]  I don't know. What do I do? What should I do? Does it mean this? Edit? Okay. Wow. What is this?
[5059.38s -> 5129.80s]  This is the fucking worst locker. Oh, whoa. Cool. Look at all this cool stuff. A shovel.
[5129.80s -> 5151.21s]  Oh, man. Just hanging up my hats. Chairs. Oh, now this is a cool music one. You have no idea
[5151.21s -> 5163.58s]  what's in those boxes. All right. I want to play a game. I'm playing now. I'm going to try my new
[5163.58s -> 5177.38s]  loadout. Regular battle. I got to try it with the motion control. I'm going to be really pissed off.
[5177.38s -> 5189.37s]  So just wait. Just wait for me to complain about the motion controls. It's going to happen. How
[5189.37s -> 5196.17s]  should I be sitting? All right. So should I calibrate it with the controller kind of facing
[5196.17s -> 5202.97s]  up? Where should my resting point be? What do you think? Should it be facing kind of down
[5202.97s -> 5206.09s]  and then up? So I face down. Where do you think it should be? Where should I rest it?
[5206.09s -> 5264.39s]  Let it rest on your lap. All right. You look goofy. Go. It's fucking weird to get. I can't get used
[5264.39s -> 5311.98s]  to this in a game scenario. It's like, no, I feel like I know I have to go back. I can't like,
[5311.98s -> 5344.20s]  no, no, it's going to make me puke. I can't do it. God. I can't use it. I can't do it. I
[5344.20s -> 5357.80s]  got to go back. No, no fucking way. Not a chance in hell. Not a chance in hell. I don't think I
[5358.12s -> 5372.09s]  don't think I've done one damage to a single other person. Let me drive my car over there.
[5372.81s -> 5419.30s]  All right. Don't get mad. All right. This is actually not that bad. It's actually not that
[5419.30s -> 5451.13s]  bad. Motion controls suck. Somebody wrote that in all caps. Let me try it without the motion
[5451.13s -> 5470.54s]  controls again. You know what my problem is? It's not just the fact that it's motion controls,
[5470.54s -> 5479.96s]  right? It's the fact that I still have to press B to jump and left trigger and rotate with the
[5479.96s -> 5484.38s]  right stick. It's just, it's not all motion controls. You're right. Right. For me, it's got
[5484.38s -> 5488.98s]  to go all in and nothing at all. Right. I got to go all in with most controls or not at all.
[5488.98s -> 5503.13s]  Like I need to make sure that I don't press any buttons besides maybe one. Okay. In my mind,
[5503.13s -> 5509.21s]  most controls are right. I got the sword and shield in both hands and there's one or two buttons
[5509.21s -> 5515.00s]  here that I can press needing to move. I don't know. I can't do the move left and right with
[5515.08s -> 5531.77s]  stick and motion controls. That's VR. Did you see how fucking weird VR is?
[5533.74s -> 5539.34s]  VR is not a good example. How many times have you walked into your wall playing VR?
[5541.18s -> 5543.82s]  How many times have you gone like this, take the headset off and go like,
[5546.20s -> 5564.47s]  and then put it? No, it doesn't work that way. Less than you. Story mode. I will. I just like,
[5564.47s -> 5584.39s]  I like playing this game. You're going to love the salmon run. I promise I'll try it.
[5591.98s -> 5614.18s]  All right. Let's pull it together here. Get off. What do you, what did I just do?
[5621.85s -> 5658.87s]  I just went back to the fountain. I forgot to buy boots. Let's go. How do I move? I don't even,
[5658.87s -> 5708.57s]  I don't know how the thing even works in invader and there was an invader. All right. Oh, you're
[5708.57s -> 5783.75s]  too fast. No motion controls. Andy, we're going to win. We're doing fine. What did you do? You
[5783.75s -> 5803.05s]  stink wicked badly. I can see the green stink lines. I should be able to check a box.
[5803.61s -> 5808.68s]  That is Cue me only with, with people that are not using motion controls.
[5808.68s -> 5830.70s]  All the motion control Morty's can play with each other. That's fine. All right. This is actually,
[5830.70s -> 5852.28s]  I promise this is the last one. Then I'm going to do story mode. Um, maybe I should hold on.
[5852.28s -> 5885.29s]  Nah, it's too late. I was a sniper on the enemy team. It's bad. Did you just,
[5885.29s -> 5900.30s]  did the person just teleport over here? I don't even know where the person came from.
[5901.10s -> 5966.04s]  Does that go through walls? I can keyboard world of Warcraft turning. Wait, is that an enemy? No,
[5966.04s -> 6019.54s]  the yellow freaks me out. What the hell? What does that thing do? Yeah. Don't let them get
[6019.54s -> 6072.82s]  away with that. I think we win. We got a lot of, uh, I think we're good. Oh yeah. We're good.
[6072.82s -> 6083.42s]  They had a disconnect. LOL. Try competitive. I'm not going to try. Why would I do that?
[6083.42s -> 6087.91s]  Yeah. I just learned. Um, I just learned how to play the game. I'm going to do ranked.
[6087.91s -> 6119.35s]  What? No way. What? All right. One more. Yeah. Well, I learned the controls,
[6119.35s -> 6137.66s]  a time to queue up against people that probably have been playing the game for like 500 hours.
[6137.66s -> 6165.26s]  All right. This is the one. Oh, I was going to dodge it. Shit. How come? Wait, where's our rollers?
[6201.22s -> 6239.62s]  Sorry. Covered a lot of ground. Where are you? Where are you? I don't even know where they are.
[6239.62s -> 6306.57s]  What the fuck? Whoa. Oh shit. Sorry. Come on. I was sitting there waiting for you.
[6307.61s -> 6339.83s]  That was a good one. How come nobody told me this game was this fun? We did. I mean,
[6339.83s -> 6345.74s]  some people did. And the recommended channel was like, Hey dude, you should really try Splatoon 3
[6345.74s -> 6349.58s]  or any Splatoon. It would be all right. And they weren't that many like thumbs up on it.
[6350.30s -> 6367.13s]  Like 15 to 25,000. So, I mean, I mean, a lot of people thought it was maybe some people did.
[6367.13s -> 6378.34s]  Oh, listen up. It's going down. Repping Anarchy Splatcast. We're live. Let's see the current
[6378.34s -> 6401.64s]  battle stages. Oh, are they changing stages? Go outside. You mean in real life? Go outside.
[6402.28s -> 6411.74s]  Why do I feel like there's a surprise birthday party waiting for me out here?
[6411.74s -> 6432.15s]  All right. What am I? What do you want me to do out here? Go to the grate.
[6440.94s -> 6445.18s]  The frame rate is so weird out here. I feel like I have 3D glasses on without a 3D movie.
[6445.18s -> 6475.08s]  Kind of hurts. All right. What do you want me to do? ZL. I've just pressed it. ZL. ZL. I'm pressing
[6475.08s -> 6493.46s]  it. Oh my God. I just have just ZL. What is the? Why can't we just call buttons the same? They're
[6493.46s -> 6496.66s]  all the same fucking controller. They have the same amount of buttons and they're in the exact
[6496.66s -> 6517.45s]  same place. Why do we have to? Why do we have to call them different things? ZLZRL. L is for left.
[6517.45s -> 6528.89s]  I know. But what is Z? I know Z is supposed to be the old N64 controller. Left bumper. Left trigger.
[6531.19s -> 6558.14s]  L1. L2. ZL. No, you don't. Flip it. ZL. It should be LZ. So why did I come down here?
[6565.58s -> 6609.11s]  Great Zapfish has gone missing. Okay. Go get the Zapfish. The pay is zero. Okay. Watch out.
[6609.11s -> 6612.15s]  Watch out. That thing does curse damage. Watch out. That does curse damage. You'll instantly get
[6612.15s -> 6632.20s]  killed. Octo-chirks. All right. So cool. Let's look for a way into the Ocarian base. If your
[6632.20s -> 6660.65s]  ears open for my nuggets of wisdom. This way. All right. Let's go. Okay. Don't touch the fuzzy ooze.
[6660.65s -> 6685.64s]  All right. That's cool. Let's go play the game. How do I get out of here? Tabletop mode? Pop that.
[6685.64s -> 6711.32s]  The whole thing would move. Disappear. That didn't do anything. Do we have anything with more oom?
[6718.02s -> 6799.40s]  Oh. Play the first level. All right. Okay. Let's go. Sick. This is pretty good burp core. Burp core.
[6799.40s -> 6830.07s]  Ooh. This is actually, this is pretty good. Rugrats core. You're right. That's a cool move.
[6830.07s -> 6855.16s]  Splat switch. Does this tell me how to aim at the center of my screen? Is it crate? Where? Far away
[6855.16s -> 6951.88s]  crate. Nice job. I got a toaster. Oh, come on. How do I get up there? Uh-oh. Watch out. An Octo-trooper.
[6951.88s -> 6999.61s]  This is LittleBigPlanet2 custom game. God. That's actually true. This is really what it feels like
[6999.61s -> 7026.94s]  that. That's a Zapfish. How do I get it? Bring it home? How do I pick it up? Oh, it's gonna be stuck
[7026.94s -> 7039.02s]  in my head all day. That's, that's fun. That's cool that you can do that. Single player is pretty
[7039.02s -> 7060.31s]  cool. Let's go back to be, uh, let's do some multiplayer. That was cool. How do I get out of
[7060.31s -> 7091.66s]  here? How do I get out of here? Menu then. Yeah. I have to go to, I have to go to the crate. Okay.
[7091.66s -> 7106.01s]  All right. There we go. Do salmon run. Let me do some more multiplayer. That's my favorite.
[7106.01s -> 7116.78s]  I'll do salmon run in another 30 minutes. All right. In 30 minutes, I will do salmon run. I
[7116.78s -> 7142.79s]  promise. I feel like I'm just starting to get good. Put on a 30 minute timer. Yeah. Mods. You can do
[7142.79s -> 7164.95s]  it. You need motion controls to improve. I think I'm doing okay. Salmon run is co-op. Well, let's,
[7164.95s -> 7197.75s]  let's do it. Cue up for it. Well, not right now, but you know, later. I like these a lot. You can
[7197.75s -> 7205.56s]  do Zelda. Yep. After I'm done playing split two and three, I will get booted from the servers.
[7205.56s -> 7222.98s]  Apparently I might have to restart the game. We'll find out. I like the, the actual just
[7222.98s -> 7227.24s]  play the game against players is probably my favorite part. I don't think this is going to
[7227.24s -> 7251.38s]  work. Only salmon run servers are up right now. No, you're a liar. All right. Let's go for it.
[7251.38s -> 7273.19s]  You got banned for being over 16. What? This is a new map. Oh, caught a few off guard.
[7273.99s -> 7393.53s]  I ran into a fucking pole. That shit out of here. I don't know this map. What the fuck? What? I
[7393.53s -> 7399.62s]  don't even know what just happened. I can't see. I thought I killed that person. Apparently they
[7399.62s -> 7417.94s]  went under. I don't know what is going on, man. All right. We're going to pull this back right now.
[7418.58s -> 7433.96s]  Wipe the whole team. All right. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Spread it, spread it, spread it.
[7433.96s -> 7439.62s]  Ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink. Oh, I think we are.
[7439.62s -> 7469.22s]  We're good. Oh, yeah, we got it. Oh, for sure. Salmon run salmon run servers are up. Oh,
[7469.22s -> 7496.44s]  are they really level five? Stop bullying this new clothes. I'll check. I got last place. I didn't
[7496.44s -> 7504.89s]  get last place. Let's be honest. We're all within a hundred points of each other. We all contributed
[7504.89s -> 7540.42s]  very well. Your catalog leveled up. I'll check it after this. You're getting carried by viewers.
[7540.42s -> 7598.22s]  That's all right. What does this do? What the hell was that? I, you know what? I just still don't.
[7598.22s -> 7663.70s]  Yeah, I don't understand how to use that fucking thing. I'm just not going to use that fucking
[7663.70s -> 7724.65s]  old. It fucks me up. I don't know. Why am I even getting into the mechanical object?
[7725.37s -> 7765.00s]  I think we're OK. Nice nerd voice. That was kind of a George. All right. Let me go check out the
[7765.00s -> 7774.94s]  gear. I was come on. Look at I did. I I may have done a couple of I screwed up a little.
[7774.94s -> 7792.58s]  I think we did all right. All right. Let me go to the shop. Some new stuff, right?
[7794.90s -> 7825.10s]  Ooh, your catalog level went up. Cool. Growing rookie detergent. Expensive. That's not funny
[7825.10s -> 7854.26s]  to waste all my money. Oh, wow. There is new stuff. All right. What does this do? Special weapon
[7854.26s -> 7866.02s]  increases damage dealt to all non-player targets. Squid rolls and squid surge is easier to easier
[7866.02s -> 7882.78s]  to do. I can't. I feel like that's pretty good. Ink tank refill rate. That seems really good.
[7882.78s -> 7914.23s]  What do we got? Special saver is the same thing. That's good. That's good, too. Should I do double
[7914.23s -> 7930.62s]  ink tank? That seems kind of good. There's diminishing returns. OK, maybe I should just
[7930.62s -> 7951.80s]  keep the thing I have on movement speed. Oh, I think I want that. I feel like I'm too slow
[7951.80s -> 7979.26s]  by that yellow shirt. All right, let's go. You look really struggle scrunchily. What's that mean?
[7979.26s -> 7997.53s]  Oh, there's a is that a sword? Hold on. What is that umbrella? We're going to test some shit up.
[7997.53s -> 8018.23s]  Whoa, this defense. I like this. Everyone stands behind you or you could just like
[8018.63s -> 8030.70s]  them. OK, sprinkler. And you only have one of those active at a time. Yeah.
[8040.47s -> 8048.18s]  Oh, you lose it. I'm assuming it has a respawn. All right. That's cool. What about the special?
[8048.18s -> 8082.90s]  Special whisper time. I like it. Maybe I'll try it. That's what that is. What about what we got?
[8082.90s -> 8096.89s]  Umbrella. This new sword. That's a windshield wiper. All right. This thing seems amazing.
[8100.82s -> 8119.06s]  Am I invisible? Am I visible when I do this? A stealth or something? Oh, it's just the camera.
[8119.06s -> 8131.96s]  OK. Is that a homing missile? All right. I'm definitely going to try this. I mean,
[8131.96s -> 8138.31s]  you can just like whack, whack, whack, whack, charge it up and bang. This seems amazing.
[8138.87s -> 8149.18s]  OK, what about the this is what everybody was doing? OK, this team. This is broken.
[8159.18s -> 8193.70s]  Very cool. All right. So what else? A Nintendo blaster. Cool. I imagine this is just a lot.
[8193.70s -> 8213.74s]  Very high damage, short range and great ink coverage. It does, doesn't it? All right.
[8213.82s -> 8231.06s]  What's the special tuna healing station? I imagine. Or is it an ink station?
[8231.06s -> 8249.38s]  It's a speed bump. Cool. All right. What's the difference between this one and this one?
[8249.38s -> 8263.24s]  There are so many weapons in this game. This one faster carbon roller is faster,
[8263.24s -> 8271.61s]  but weaker. Actually, I would like this way more. You can actually get some coverage.
[8271.61s -> 8296.12s]  Well, Tune 2 had over 300 weapons. What? In my brain, it was just this thing,
[8296.12s -> 8300.26s]  the regular gun in the sniper rifle. I didn't think it was this detailed. I really didn't.
[8300.82s -> 8329.74s]  All right. What's the special look like? I don't know. What the hell? That's weird.
[8329.74s -> 8337.14s]  All right. Well, I'm going to do I'm going to do I'm going to do the sword and umbrella.
[8337.14s -> 8359.91s]  Is it a flamethrower cleanup? What is this? Oh, I get it. So you can be like, all right,
[8359.91s -> 8379.75s]  throw that shit and you know what I mean? Like this pop. Oh, that's really cool. I like that.
[8379.75s -> 8423.90s]  I like it. Wait, Jesus. I still think I'm going with the I'm going with the sword sword and I'll
[8423.90s -> 8436.95s]  try I'll get this thing. I'll try this thing. Are you going to be mad if I have to pee again?
[8436.95s -> 8583.82s]  Right back. Okie dokie. His aim is awful. I don't think I can't see what you're writing.
[8583.82s -> 8592.95s]  Don't act like I can't see what you just wrote. OK, so I got my new weapon. I'm ready to go.
[8592.95s -> 8603.80s]  We heard you dodge roll while you peed. Can you imagine that? It's just a stream of piss.
[8604.68s -> 8608.71s]  And then like, I don't think you would. Well, you wouldn't think I dodge rolled.
[8608.71s -> 8620.90s]  You think I like fell down. You just hear the fat rolling sound with a bunch of gear on.
[8620.90s -> 8634.39s]  All right, let's play. I want to see the funny platoon messages.
[8636.39s -> 8646.98s]  Well, you're going to have to wait until you play. Turn on post. I'm not doing it.
[8649.19s -> 8667.27s]  I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. The plaza is full of drawings.
[8667.27s -> 8675.00s]  All right. Can you confirm or deny that? What if I maybe I'll check it out?
[8675.00s -> 8680.98s]  Maybe if you're good on your birthday. All right, let's go check it out.
[8696.71s -> 8741.94s]  I didn't I got so mad right there. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it.
[8741.94s -> 8770.22s]  Sorry, I thought you were an enemy. Get that shit away from me. What was that little dog?
[8770.22s -> 8857.83s]  What was that little dog? Let's go. I got no ink. All right, man, I was I was going nuts there.
[8882.63s -> 8891.05s]  I'm impressed you didn't fall into the water. Can you actually does it kill you?
[8891.05s -> 8900.71s]  I'll try salmon run on your birthday. I didn't let's get off that screen because
[8900.71s -> 8904.78s]  I didn't really do that. I did a lot of kill stealing, I think. No, I didn't.
[8904.78s -> 8911.48s]  I got a lot of secured kills. You saw it was like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[8911.48s -> 8935.11s]  I did pretty good. It's my birthday today. Well, happy. All right. Happy birthday.
[8935.11s -> 8941.54s]  We'll play salmon run. I didn't know it was your birthday today. Happy birthday.
[8942.50s -> 9006.58s]  I miss I was doing pretty good, too. That's unfortunate. It's the same spot in the same
[9006.58s -> 9043.08s]  spot, dude. Are you kidding me? I died in the same place. Pixel perfect. We got them all.
[9043.72s -> 9068.10s]  Let's go. One minute left. All right, we can pull this together right now.
[9079.37s -> 9126.41s]  There was somebody behind me. I'm going to install it. We all right. We're doing good.
[9126.41s -> 9134.82s]  I think we actually pulled it back. Look at that. Look what we did in that last 10 seconds.
[9134.82s -> 9154.70s]  We had to have gotten it. Yep. Throw your switch in the trash. That's so funny because the switch is
[9154.70s -> 9162.14s]  the only console that is big enough to throw away in the trash like it's a crumpled up piece
[9162.14s -> 9169.74s]  of paper. You can actually just drop it into the trash. You can't do that with a PS5 or Xbox.
[9170.68s -> 9190.20s]  It's too big. All right. This is the last one. I still want to play Breath of the Wild, too.
[9190.84s -> 9200.46s]  I like this weapon. It doesn't do very much damage, but it secures kills.
[9202.46s -> 9206.14s]  I don't do a whole lot of painting, but I've secured a lot of kills. You know it.
[9207.10s -> 9241.27s]  Don't tell me I haven't. You know it. You've seen it. Let me try. Might as well put the other
[9241.27s -> 9259.40s]  weapon on then, right? This is the new one I got. Oh, this one you shake, shake, shake, shake,
[9259.40s -> 9267.93s]  shake, shake, bro. This got a lot of spread on it. This is actually pretty damn good.
[9267.93s -> 9272.55s]  All right. How does this one work? Yeah. All right. We'll try this.
[9275.61s -> 9281.03s]  Please beatbox the Splatoon 3 theme. I, I don't
[9285.99s -> 9306.31s]  I don't think I can do it. All right. I'm actually going to get to play or what?
[9306.31s -> 9315.30s]  I don't like the water levels. You die instantly. This is GTA 3.
[9316.02s -> 9357.54s]  So yeah, I didn't get anybody. How did that not get one person? That's
[9357.54s -> 9362.02s]  un possible. That's impossible. What? I didn't get one person. I hit everybody.
[9378.70s -> 9404.25s]  You got a person. Okay. This game is fun. Damn. That was like three else at the same time.
[9404.25s -> 9457.78s]  What's that bubble launcher? I want that. Did you see what happened? Cause I don't.
[9457.78s -> 9474.60s]  Where were you? I think we lost. Oh my God. That's a wipe out. Over did that. You're an absolute pro
[9475.32s -> 9507.46s]  got that coverage. I was, I was only looking for coverage. I wasn't looking for kills.
[9507.46s -> 9532.73s]  I was looking for coverage, not kills. And we got it. It's been 30 minutes.
[9532.73s -> 9547.78s]  All right. I'm going to play one more and then that's it. And I'll do, um, salmon run.
[9547.78s -> 9574.47s]  If this is not the last one before salmon run, I will take a bite out of my switch.
[9574.47s -> 9578.94s]  I, okay. But I don't have to play that for a while. I can come right back to this,
[9578.94s -> 9606.15s]  but I will try salmon run after this. We need more coverage guys. What's going on here?
[9606.15s -> 9610.41s]  Guys, where's the coverage? Am I good? I have to take care of everything here.
[9611.13s -> 9753.74s]  Where's the coverage? There we go. Good coverage. Good coverage. How do you jump?
[9753.74s -> 9775.26s]  Just zone, zone, zone, zone them, zone them, zone them. That's going to be one of the best of the
[9775.26s -> 9809.22s]  night. You just made my seven year old nephew cry, dude. What the fuck? I want it. Can I see the,
[9809.78s -> 9821.21s]  let's get a screenshot of that one. Just saying. All right. Where's the salmon run thing?
[9831.56s -> 9851.58s]  Same place, right? But where do I do it? Okay. I guess I'll just do this one, right? Whatever
[9851.58s -> 9875.30s]  this is on fishing hydro plant map. Wait, what do you want me to do? Riz Co. Happy birthday, by the
[9875.30s -> 9929.19s]  way. Don't skip this. I'm ready. Tutorial. The tutorial is mega important. All right. Okay.
[9929.99s -> 9940.30s]  Listen up. Salmon is, will approach from the water. Get rid of them. They drop power eggs.
[9943.26s -> 9985.91s]  Okay. Is he enough? Why are the graphics better? Okay. More power eggs. Cool.
[9988.55s -> 9996.58s]  Sounds good. Harvest golden eggs. Only boss salmonids have those. Boss salmonid
[9996.58s -> 10021.96s]  alert. I like the colors. All right. There's a boss salmonid somewhere. You have to walk into
[10021.96s -> 10037.90s]  these. Okay. You have to get golden eggs. Take them back to the egg basket and only hold one
[10037.90s -> 10075.64s]  at a time. Okay. Okay. So they can steal them and take them back, right? How many people play in
[10075.64s -> 10095.42s]  a game? Okay. I think I get it. Okay. Communicating with your coworkers is an essential part of egg
[10095.42s -> 10119.38s]  collection. What just happened? Oh, okay. Okay. So if everybody dies, it's over. Up is asked for
[10119.38s -> 10131.19s]  help. Okay. Okay. I get it. It's like zombies. I actually never really played zombies at all.
[10137.85s -> 10179.26s]  Cool. We have 100 seconds. Okay. Got it. Grow your golden egg. Oh, so you can toss it to
[10179.26s -> 10201.98s]  people. I got it. All right. So you have to stay alive till the end. Do you get points for doing
[10201.98s -> 10232.70s]  extra golden eggs or no? Or oh, you do, I think. Okay. Literally on screen. You only get two uses
[10232.70s -> 10250.22s]  of your special. Who has this move? Because that's amazing. That's so much fun. Whose move is this?
[10250.94s -> 10266.01s]  Somebody have this in the actual game? They do the tri slasher. All right. I want to try. I want to
[10266.01s -> 10304.74s]  play with that. But first, another round of training. All right. This is an important one.
[10304.90s -> 10327.50s]  All right. I'll pay attention. Okay. The not basics. There are 11 kinds of bosses.
[10329.54s -> 10335.13s]  Which one do you want? Does it matter? This one?
[10344.39s -> 10361.82s]  Do all of them. Just do all of them. Um, okay. Place a bomb. What's up? What do you mean place a
[10361.82s -> 10385.50s]  bomb? Does that count? All right. Steelhead. It lobs giant smelly. Um, what does it say?
[10385.50s -> 10412.87s]  Shoot the bomb on his head. Hey, how do you, I don't have the range to hit that. I can't reach
[10412.87s -> 10474.52s]  that far. It happens so fast. What the fuck? All right. So that's that one. Launches missiles,
[10474.52s -> 10531.64s]  toss a bomb into both of its missile launchers. I was going to say that did not go in there.
[10544.44s -> 10555.48s]  Okay. This is much easier with four players. Yeah. All right. Scrapper
[10558.63s -> 10564.87s]  covers its frail body and shields made of cookware and putters forward. Okay. Get behind it.
[10586.14s -> 10600.30s]  Cool. All right. We're like almost halfway there. Don't let it touch you.
[10603.06s -> 10605.94s]  The slimy pilot is sitting in the tail end. So I hit it in the tail.
[10606.74s -> 10615.27s]  We do really have to do all these. I feel like I could just be in voice chat and somebody will
[10615.27s -> 10618.71s]  just peek, blow out their microphones, screaming at me for what I need to do.
[10619.35s -> 10622.79s]  And then call me a bunch of names because I didn't do it right. And then I'll figure it out. I'll
[10622.79s -> 10645.37s]  learn. We're almost done. I might as well do more. Stinger sits on top of a tower. Okay.
[10671.61s -> 10679.22s]  Did that one. All right. Drizzler. Our torpedoes that create clouds that rain ink. When it's under
[10679.22s -> 10685.99s]  its umbrella, your attacks can't hurt it. So he peeks. You can also hit its rockets to knock
[10685.99s -> 10732.26s]  them back. All right. All right. Fish stick. They plant a pillar in the ground and flying
[10732.26s -> 10737.38s]  circles around the top and spray ink all over. The pillar will stick around once they're gone.
[10737.38s -> 10761.58s]  So put it to good use. All right. You have to climb the pillar. I get it.
[10772.55s -> 10778.15s]  Flipper throws out an ink ring, then dives into it. Do not get caught inside the ring.
[10778.95s -> 10783.10s]  Cover the ring in your own ink before it can dive. Then it'll be a little bump.
[10783.10s -> 10804.63s]  All right. Cool. I'm a salmon runner and it gets much harder than this. I would imagine it does.
[10804.63s -> 10812.74s]  I'm gonna get some more. Big shot launcher. Jump over the shock waves from the cannon balls.
[10813.46s -> 10858.71s]  Cool. Use the cannon. All right. This is a UFO. Walk under it and it'll try to squash you.
[10859.43s -> 10863.35s]  If it tries to squash you and you dodge, you can climb on top and take it out. All right.
[10883.21s -> 10915.43s]  Let's go. That wraps up the training. All right. Let's do it. Thanks for sticking with the tutorial.
[10917.83s -> 10938.42s]  One last thing. It's all random. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's do it.
[10939.22s -> 10945.40s]  Relance team of randoms. I mean, I just, there's no way. I'm not going to put like a code in the chat
[10946.78s -> 10951.74s]  and we're going to a hundred million people are going to try to join. I'm just going random.
[10951.74s -> 10981.69s]  How far can you actually throw this? Does it depend on your ink? Let's do it. Let's get it.
[10981.69s -> 11026.55s]  Hey, as we say, let's get it. All right. Wave one. Oh, boss salmon alert. It's umbrella. Nice
[11026.55s -> 11048.50s]  work. Nice work crew. Nice work. All right. That's good. Let's, uh, let's go back to the other game
[11048.50s -> 11079.75s]  now. Oops. I didn't mean to press that. I ended up working out with grenades. We do have grenades.
[11079.75s -> 11090.78s]  Okay. All right. I didn't know if you had to buy them. Boss incoming. What is it? It's a frying pan.
[11091.50s -> 11131.03s]  Oh shit. We did it. All right. Wave two. What's wrong with us? What's wrong with us?
[11133.51s -> 11180.42s]  What the fuck just happened? Who's coming? Who is it? What is it? Oh, it's a tower.
[11181.30s -> 11243.88s]  Chow crash can. This is cool. He hates this night. What? No, I don't. You've been loaned
[11243.88s -> 11252.65s]  the Octo brush by a final wave. All right. This is pretty tight.
[11343.29s -> 11360.10s]  Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Knock out. Knock out. Piece of cake.
[11360.66s -> 11389.08s]  Okay. So that was fun. So we get currency for this. Do you buy weapons? Okay. You got a raise.
[11393.96s -> 11424.78s]  Oh, I got an egg to open. Is that a surprise egg? So you get a rank up and it gets harder. All
[11424.78s -> 11445.64s]  right. I think I understand. Oh, this. I want this thing so bad. Splatoon is just cool. Look
[11445.64s -> 11453.42s]  at your awesome new Mega Man weapon that you just got. The video game. I love it. I want to use this
[11453.42s -> 11462.57s]  now. When do I get to kill cut man? When's electricity man die? So I get his electricity
[11462.57s -> 11506.23s]  bubbles. Oh, it's, um, no, I guess we got them. Okay. What is the grenade for this?
[11506.95s -> 11538.60s]  Actually, I don't know what it does. I think it's regular. Just regular. We're good, right?
[11538.60s -> 11562.04s]  Best of all, this music is bumping. It is pretty bumping. You're right. Splasher. Oh, medic. All
[11562.04s -> 11600.68s]  right. Where are they coming from? Which side are they often? Do I get credit for helping? Oh,
[11600.68s -> 11616.98s]  do I have to actually score it? Am I messing points up for myself? Oh, look out. Where is it?
[11621.45s -> 11676.14s]  Down here. Oh, thank you. Holy shit. Okay. I think we just lost. Revive me quick so I get experience.
[11676.14s -> 11711.30s]  Okay. Yeah. Now we're talking. Now I'm going to be doing some big, big damage. What's that mean?
[11711.86s -> 11776.42s]  Stop idling. Who cares? Just put it in. All right. Now to survive. All right. We're good. 14
[11776.42s -> 11804.44s]  things. Oh my goodness. Whereas the teammate don't have to just shoot at it. We did really good in
[11804.44s -> 11833.40s]  the last wave. Stay with your team at all times. Okay. Go get another, uh, hat. All right. Somebody
[11833.40s -> 11856.25s]  said that the, on the shelf is my stuff. Where is it? Oh, it can't be in queue. Okay. So when does
[11856.25s -> 11968.68s]  this start becoming really, really hard right now? Umbrella down here. Watch that side. Where's this
[11968.68s -> 11985.54s]  boss? Six out of six. I feel like we missed out on something. Did we miss out on something? Or was
[11985.54s -> 12005.22s]  it not on the right side? 96 gal? This does not seem like the greatest thing to spread out paint.
[12005.78s -> 12053.67s]  Do a taunt. Crashcan. Where's everybody? Oh, come here. Come here. Come here. I got you. I got you.
[12066.92s -> 12099.75s]  Oh, we're good, right? Oh my God. We just got absolutely detonated. I think we're good. Yeah,
[12100.31s -> 12120.46s]  we're good. Final wave. I guess I fell in the water. What happens?
[12129.24s -> 12225.98s]  Help me. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. What does this do? Holy shit. So this is the gentleman's cod zombies.
[12225.98s -> 12252.14s]  This webcam going to like two FPS. Do one more because it's going to be so hard now. Okay.
[12252.14s -> 12285.75s]  All right. Now I'm at part timer. Now the surprise egg. Uh, let's do it again. It's going to be a bit
[12285.75s -> 12303.88s]  harder. I'm so happy you're playing this. This is my favorite mode. I did not know there was this
[12303.88s -> 12317.78s]  much content in Splatoon. I saw Splatoon as like a side game. I don't know why. Oh yeah. It's just
[12317.78s -> 12322.34s]  an extra game mode for this other. It's like an extra game. It's like portal in the orange box,
[12323.38s -> 12328.70s]  but portal was awesome. I don't know why I was like, yeah, it's just like a game. It's not really
[12328.70s -> 12350.78s]  a game. I didn't, I didn't know there was this much to do. All I ever knew Splatoon was as the
[12350.78s -> 12374.02s]  Wii U big brick side game. That's all I know. Monster. That's what you call an A minus move.
[12415.72s -> 12433.59s]  Yo, we need that. Throw it in. Oh, sorry. The game is going to get content updates for two more
[12433.59s -> 12444.28s]  years for free. Really? I just thought this was the Wii U brick side game. I didn't know.
[12457.27s -> 12471.43s]  Help, help, help, help, help. Sorry. It's okay. Sorry. I got one in. It's all right. Come on,
[12471.43s -> 12506.18s]  man. I got to get over there. Did I go win? All right. Good. Uh, he's weird behind a wall.
[12506.18s -> 12552.06s]  Good. Got it. I'll take left side. We have the left side. They can't hear you.
[12555.98s -> 12606.79s]  Best weapon in the game. Oh shit. Okay. I can get it from over here. Looking good, right?
[12606.79s -> 12632.68s]  There's a couple more. What's raining on us? Something's raining on us. What is firing? Oh,
[12645.96s -> 12665.10s]  oh shit. It's that. Oh my God. Get up there. Pick one of these up. What's happening to my body?
[12665.10s -> 12674.90s]  What the hell was that? I couldn't pick one up. Why couldn't I pick one up? I had one.
[12677.18s -> 12693.86s]  I didn't know I had one. This is as fun as the regular game. This is really cool. I like this a
[12693.86s -> 12707.24s]  lot. All right. I'm going to get to the next rank and we'll see. I do want to play Breath of the
[12707.24s -> 12713.14s]  Wild for at least an hour or two. Or do I just play Splatoon and the Breath of the Wild fans
[12713.14s -> 12725.96s]  are going to be very mad about this? I don't know. What should I do? Breath of the Wild has a lot of
[12725.96s -> 12743.18s]  fans. I'm not sure they would like that. I do a poll. Do you want me to continue playing Splatoon
[12743.18s -> 12750.02s]  for the rest of the stream and whatever? More Splatoon or Breath of the Wild in another 30
[12750.02s -> 12769.58s]  minutes? Breath of the Wild in 30 minutes or Splatoon for the rest of the stream? It's going
[12769.58s -> 12791.43s]  to get hard. Oh, I need to be the one that hits that. This is my job. I'm going to get up top.
[12791.43s -> 12872.25s]  I got it. Oh, you got it. You're good. Oh my god. Oh, OK. We're good. All right. What are we
[12872.25s -> 12892.82s]  doing? Splatoon one by a lot. Oh, man. That was close. That was so close. That's so close.
[12893.62s -> 12957.30s]  Is that too close to call? No, it's not. It's over. Chainsaw. Another trash can. Trash can.
[12974.68s -> 12993.72s]  Thank you. Why won't this thing fucking die? All right. We could do another poll. That's not how
[12993.72s -> 13039.80s]  it works, man. Two thousand people voted out of fifteen thousand. Watch out for the dog. Roger
[13039.80s -> 13129.69s]  that. Umbrella. Giant. Giant. We're good. Who are you talking to? You should delay the switch
[13129.69s -> 13158.78s]  break. What else is there to play? What else is there to play? Not much, right? So what do I? I
[13158.78s -> 13168.68s]  got to leave, right? So I want to get my shit. So where do I do that? I have to be out of the lobby?
[13177.74s -> 13186.36s]  Front desk. Where's that? You can do Mario Odyssey. I already played Mario Odyssey.
[13186.36s -> 13198.87s]  I already beat it on my own time. It's in this room. Oh, here we go.
[13200.55s -> 13218.71s]  Let's open them. Oh, what did I get? Swap for chunks. I don't get it. Keep new gear. I mean,
[13218.71s -> 13240.01s]  that one's better, right? I'll keep the new one. Slop suit. A green slop suit. I don't know.
[13256.22s -> 13282.62s]  I'm almost at a part timer. Can you play grounded? I actually wanted to play it.
[13282.62s -> 13316.68s]  I actually wanted to try it. Okay. I'm trying to give us some, uh, some avenues here.
[13322.60s -> 13364.34s]  Shit. There's a perfect throw too. Thank you. We need it. Quester time. I didn't, did I not throw
[13364.34s -> 13405.14s]  it? We're good. We're good. We're good. We're fine. Don't hit me off. Oh my God. I hate water so
[13405.14s -> 13426.86s]  much. I'm never drinking it ever again. Only Gatorade from now on. Only Gatorade. Why is it
[13426.86s -> 13439.99s]  getting so dark? A giant tornado is approaching. What's that mean? Where's my teammates? Where'd
[13439.99s -> 13493.08s]  they go? Where'd the team go? Uh oh. Oh, we're good. Okay. That was fun. What happens if you
[13493.08s -> 13509.70s]  get them all? We got every single one. There's a big golden chest over here. Holy shit. What?
[13509.70s -> 13514.26s]  All right. I have an idea. I'm going to throw them over here and you guys get them and throw
[13514.26s -> 13575.50s]  them that way. We're good. That was a lot. All right. Final wave over here. We got at least five
[13575.50s -> 13583.86s]  or six. Oh my God. I'm never drinking water. I'm never going to go swimming. I'm never going to
[13583.86s -> 13606.22s]  drink water. I'm only going to... Oh my God. It's me. Where's head? We all died instantly. That was
[13606.22s -> 13621.11s]  instantaneous. Holy shit. That was just... We all popped in five seconds. Jerma, you're 70% water.
[13621.11s -> 13640.23s]  Get it out of me. Get off me. That one doesn't count. That one doesn't count. Why is my camera
[13640.47s -> 13652.17s]  frame ratey right now? Is it? Kind of is. Why is it frame ratey? That one doesn't count.
[13671.82s -> 13691.72s]  When are you going to play Breath of the Wild? Okay. So it was 53% to 47%. What does my vote
[13691.72s -> 13708.62s]  count for? How many percentage points does my vote count for? 5%? I would say, I would probably say
[13708.62s -> 13716.62s]  at least 10%. How many shares of my own company do I own? Right? That's got to be a lot.
[13717.42s -> 13778.01s]  Do streamers play this game? Deadass. I'm going to leave the stream if you don't. What? It's rare?
[13778.65s -> 13810.06s]  Vinny does? Vinny plays? Hmm. Shit. Watch out. Streamers are surprised that Nintendo games are
[13810.06s -> 13829.67s]  fun. We have some mods. We have some mod opinions here. I have a senior investor. I have a good
[13829.67s -> 13881.75s]  chunk of stock. Well, all right. Leather jacket. What's your share vote? It's typing. Get out of
[13881.75s -> 13902.94s]  the fucking way. You're so annoying. Leather jacket is deferring choice to streamers choice.
[13902.94s -> 13921.90s]  Okay. I'm just sitting around. I'm the CEO. God damn it. VR Josh has deferred his vote to the CEO.
[13921.90s -> 13937.62s]  Okay. Grump said that seems like you're enjoying Splatoon. I defer my voice to
[13938.34s -> 13946.31s]  streamers choice, which is Splatoon 3. Why can't I talk? I'm speech jamming myself.
[13947.19s -> 13961.18s]  What's this? What do we have to do with this? ZL. What do I do about what's this? What do we do with
[13961.18s -> 14017.45s]  that? Bro, what's happening? What? I don't even understand this game mode. Why are there big giant
[14017.45s -> 14058.06s]  marbles everywhere? This fucking orbital strike fly fish. Well, somebody explained to me what those
[14058.06s -> 14063.34s]  those bait giant bait balls were. They didn't even know what they were. I didn't even know what they
[14063.34s -> 14072.44s]  were. ZL, look at this huge ball. This is a weird game mode. What was that? I thought we had to move
[14072.44s -> 14092.92s]  those. I would have been in there with the team. They're turrets. I thought I had to roll those down
[14092.92s -> 14097.96s]  into the basket. They look just like this. They're the same exact color, the same sheen, everything.
[14098.52s -> 14128.68s]  They're the same color, same sheen, same metal. Art time, Perry. All right. So we have three
[14128.68s -> 14140.68s]  mods that have deferred their shares. I mean, I've got to see what Burger Boy has to say.
[14140.68s -> 14150.52s]  He's one of the biggest shareholders. Hey, dude, need your opinion on I need a share vote on a game.
[14150.52s -> 14159.96s]  Hold on. Is he watching? Let's see. Breath of the Wild for Splatoon. Need opinion. Need votes for
[14159.96s -> 14195.18s]  your shares. You have 20,000. He's typing. Bro, your stream sucks now. I sold all my shares a year
[14195.18s -> 14242.55s]  and a half ago. Do it again. What's this weird golden one? Dude, what the fuck is this little
[14242.55s -> 14259.03s]  weirdo? Why are you using your special in wave one? I've never even seen that guy before. Oh,
[14259.03s -> 14272.34s]  wait. I have three shares left. Forgot about them. I put my three shares to Splatoon. I put what?
[14272.34s -> 14330.74s]  You lose rank? That's not good. All right. Kind of pay attention. No more fucking around. Just unlock.
[14330.74s -> 14384.54s]  You don't need the team. These players, man, swear to God, don't need the team playing like
[14384.54s -> 14428.18s]  fucking bronze players. Dr. Clay, throw my shares in the air wherever they land is where they will
[14428.18s -> 14439.50s]  go. Oh, what the fuck, dude? 12345678910. They all landed on Splatoon. That's weird. Heads. Heads.
[14439.50s -> 14447.48s]  Whoa. That one landed on its edge, which I'll put that to Breath of the Wild. That's fair.
[14448.36s -> 14452.06s]  All right. Pay fucking attention to the game. You moron. What am I doing? I'm like,
[14452.06s -> 14497.24s]  I'm away from the entire team. Oh, my. Get this thing away from. Why is it attacking me
[14497.24s -> 14499.88s]  of all the people? There's four of us here. Why is it attacking me?
[14500.84s -> 14505.56s]  Why do I have all the aggro of every single enemy in the whole entire map?
[14514.20s -> 14517.88s]  We all did it. I wasn't the only one. I wasn't the only one. I wasn't the only one.
[14541.69s -> 14551.46s]  We're good. This is we're doing it. I actually really don't like this weapon.
[14552.10s -> 14663.75s]  But that was a little snail thing. Oh, activate. Oh, shit. We did 20 out of eight. We kind of
[14663.75s -> 14677.72s]  cleaned up there. We lost a player. Mandatory overtime is an egg cannon. Get to work.
[14677.72s -> 14704.06s]  Somebody else use that. I don't know what that does. That was stupid. What he took. He blew up
[14704.06s -> 14710.30s]  the entire map. We all die instantly. He kills everybody and you can't get away.
[14710.30s -> 14720.26s]  What are you supposed to do? What are you supposed to do? We lost a player.
[14720.90s -> 14740.15s]  I'm going to do Breath of the Wild. Is Breath of the Wild canceled? I just want to know because
[14740.15s -> 14759.03s]  it's late here and I want to leave. Shit. People want to see Breath of the Wild. All right. All
[14759.03s -> 14774.54s]  right. All right. All right. I'm going to extend the switch in on Sunday. Here's what's going to
[14774.54s -> 14780.89s]  happen. Are you ready? Listen to me. I want to all the shareholders need to listen. I was going
[14780.89s -> 14788.01s]  to do like a half Breath of the Wild stream, half Splatoon stream today, and I didn't do that.
[14788.01s -> 14792.97s]  But I'm doing Splatoon right now. But you know what that means? Listen to me shareholders.
[14793.61s -> 14797.21s]  That means that it will be an entire stream of Breath of the Wild on Sunday.
[14800.52s -> 14809.85s]  I was going to leave the switch on Sunday. Are we OK with that compromise? What the hell is this?
[14809.85s -> 14819.70s]  Why? Can I get a vote? Can we get a shareholders vote, please? Are you OK with Sunday being an
[14819.70s -> 14874.34s]  entire day of Breath of the Wild? Not a thing. Splatoon on Sunday too. No. We're kind of going
[14874.34s -> 14928.52s]  fracked out here. 23. OK. What are these new enemies? Shoot it in the mouth? Booyah, booyah,
[14928.52s -> 14955.21s]  booyah. Oh my goodness. That's a lot. I don't understand this one. How does this one work?
[14996.71s -> 15012.71s]  Breath of the Wild 82 percent. What? Only 1400 shareholders. What's going on?
[15020.78s -> 15061.13s]  This was for all. This was for Sunday. OK. How's that? Not hitting you. Oh, we're way far away.
[15086.60s -> 15113.72s]  Oh, I'm bad. We're good. Will you land already? Dude, why wouldn't that thing land? Yeah,
[15113.72s -> 15117.72s]  we'll do a full Breath of the Wild stream on Sunday. That makes more sense to me.
[15117.72s -> 15128.79s]  I may have been going for four hours, four and a half hours or so. Am I going to go to
[15128.79s -> 15133.96s]  Breath of the Wild for like an hour and 45 minutes, two hours? We'll do a full six to
[15133.96s -> 15161.90s]  seven hour stream on Sunday. Breath of the Wild. Oh, all right. Frank up. Are you going to complete
[15161.90s -> 15176.12s]  Breath of the Wild? I don't know. I'm going to play it until it's no longer fun for me,
[15176.12s -> 15196.82s]  which maybe I'll beat the whole thing. You postpone Breath of the Wild twice. You're doing
[15196.82s -> 15210.94s]  it a third time. Breath of the Wild is the last thing I streamed before this. Who remembers
[15210.94s -> 15218.58s]  the Omega Weekend? Hey, Omega Weekend. I streamed for 14 hours in a row. That's the longest stream
[15218.66s -> 15225.22s]  I've ever done. I am going to say on the record that that was an Omega Weekend. That was literally
[15225.22s -> 15229.46s]  a 14 hour stream. I don't do those. I will never do one of those ever again. That was an Omega
[15229.46s -> 15235.88s]  Weekend. Hey, you went to sleep and woke up and I was still streaming. I didn't do that. I stayed
[15235.88s -> 15278.76s]  up. That's an Omega Weekend. It was an Omega Friday. It was Omega Friday night and then we
[15278.76s -> 15288.09s]  were at Omega Saturday morning. Friday, Saturday and then I streamed on Sunday. I streamed on Sunday.
[15288.81s -> 15292.26s]  You don't remember that. You're remembering Omega Weekend wrong.
[15292.98s -> 15318.90s]  How are we all trying to do the same fucking thing? What's raining? Get the shit out of here.
[15318.90s -> 15347.94s]  Sorry. The oil game took up 80% of your Omega Weekend. So? No, it didn't. I was streaming for
[15347.94s -> 15383.30s]  like eight or nine hours before I did that. Holy shit. That would have just wiped us all out.
[15383.86s -> 15400.55s]  Someone's talking shit. Hey, come on. It's Groggy Gary. You guys don't mean that. Come on. It's
[15400.55s -> 15435.50s]  Groggy Gary here. What are you? Hey, shit. This is bad. Oh, fuck. That's going to kill us all.
[15443.21s -> 15456.78s]  No, I want to rescue you. How do I rescue this person? Oh, that's not the final round. Shit.
[15457.58s -> 15460.22s]  I thought that was, I don't know why my brain thought that was the last one. That's all right.
[15461.02s -> 15555.00s]  Where is he? Got it. Where is everybody? Oh, oh my God. Who's alive? I don't even know where they
[15555.00s -> 15576.92s]  are. We get it. Ah, thank God. He's still playing Splatoon. I thought he was going to play Breath
[15576.92s -> 15610.36s]  of the Wild. Oh, my Breath of the Wild got a virus. It was tragic. Yeah. Yeah. I was downloading
[15611.24s -> 15629.26s]  funny mods and I, I don't know. I crashed it. It sucks, dude. I don't know what I did, but every
[15629.26s -> 15635.56s]  time I opened Breath of the Wild, it starts playing the music and maybe somebody can help.
[15635.56s -> 15644.74s]  It starts going like, and I have to like hold the power, but I have to unplug this quick.
[15645.70s -> 15664.46s]  All right. I got to pay attention. We're in the big leagues now.
[15680.65s -> 15725.67s]  Thank you. Where's the boss? Oh my God. That thing's lasered. All right. It's over here.
[15725.67s -> 15757.51s]  I get it. I got it. No, I didn't. Where is it? Have I not picked it up? What drugs is this guy
[15757.51s -> 15793.93s]  character on? I, I couldn't pick it up. I was trying to pick it up. What did I think? Actually,
[15793.93s -> 15860.33s]  I think I just did that drill. Let's work low end UFO. Oh my goodness. What a fucking play.
[15860.33s -> 15898.94s]  That was all right. This is it. This is the, I got to really be in the front lines because this
[15898.94s -> 15939.45s]  weapon is seriously like, I can't, I cannot mess around. What is it? Oh, drill. We all right.
[15939.45s -> 15969.13s]  Somebody disconnect. Oh my God. What's happening over here? Oh my God, dude. We, well, we lost a
[15969.13s -> 16006.18s]  player. I can't. What was I doing? Oh my God. I kept on falling down. I was hovering and falling,
[16006.18s -> 16022.71s]  hovering and falling. We still won. Oh, look at whatever. 51 eggs. That's a lot. We lost a player.
[16022.71s -> 16054.92s]  That wasn't fair. Almost there. Another hat. You lost viewers. No, sorry. Those viewers are just,
[16054.92s -> 16059.58s]  they now know they have a day or two to prepare. So they're going to order the like 10 foot long
[16059.58s -> 16064.76s]  subway sandwich and have a party when I do the Breath of the Wild stream on Sunday. They're
[16064.76s -> 16070.89s]  just preparing. They just got to go and figure out what they're going to do. I want one of those
[16070.89s -> 16091.48s]  right now. I could probably eat the whole thing. I don't know. I don't think I would stop eating it.
[16092.20s -> 16099.02s]  If you got me like a cheese steak, like a six foot long cheese steak, and it was just like, oh hey,
[16099.02s -> 16102.62s]  by the way, like no, no one else is going to eat this. Like you can have it. I'd be like,
[16103.74s -> 16130.73s]  really? I'd probably eat the whole thing. My goodness. You take care of it. You got it.
[16131.45s -> 16183.13s]  Oh, shit. All right. We're good. Just stay alive. We're good. We're good. We don't have to get
[16183.77s -> 16207.03s]  anything more than the quarter. That's fine. Yeah. Nice cheese steak. Oh, play Stardew Valley. Um,
[16207.59s -> 16212.28s]  I played that a long time ago. Ice cream. That was like one of my first things I did on Twitch.
[16261.48s -> 16294.90s]  Mom, yeah. Oh, come to me. Walk to me. Walk to me. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.
[16294.90s -> 16312.02s]  That's 20. You've been more than 20. We're good. You're throwing on purpose. We just got 23
[16312.02s -> 16339.48s]  globs. You strike me as a Disney mom. Open, open, open, open, open, open. Good start. Good start.
[16340.20s -> 16399.30s]  Need some help over here. Good start. Oh, shit. Thank you. There's so much over here. Dude,
[16399.30s -> 16404.42s]  who even hit me? You don't even fucking lagging. I lagged out. Lag. I just lagged out.
[16405.14s -> 16428.10s]  Fuck it. I'm doing it. Somebody put these in. Somebody put these in. Somebody put them in.
[16428.82s -> 16444.95s]  All right. We got 22. All right. How do I not die from this thing? How do I not die from this?
[16448.18s -> 16464.92s]  Just get the fuck out of the way. I'm out of the way. I'm getting out of the way.
[16465.48s -> 16504.18s]  I'm out of the way. Where is he? This is hitting. I'm going to be a grenade, Andy. Where's the person
[16504.18s -> 16506.34s]  that's died? I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. Come here. Come here. Come here.
[16521.74s -> 16523.90s]  Keep on the lookout for other monsters.
[16551.88s -> 16561.88s]  You throw the golden eggs at it and oh, I didn't know that. So close. So close. You throw the eggs
[16561.88s -> 16586.54s]  at 60 eggs. I hold on. Excuse me. I ate your sub order last week. It was mid. Sorry. What's my
[16586.54s -> 16602.23s]  sub order? It was mid. What's my sub order? It was mid. It was mid. A C? Like a C plus? That's
[16602.23s -> 16607.69s]  fucking fine. Mid I guess. It's like a medium. It's like mid. That means it's okay. That means
[16607.69s -> 16614.76s]  it's good. That means you didn't dislike it. You thought it was okay. So what? It was a meatball
[16614.76s -> 16630.42s]  sub? You're a fucking boomer. Mid means bad. To me, mid means like middle of the road. That was
[16630.42s -> 16647.50s]  mid. That was middle. That was like a C. It does mean that. But what are we complaining about?
[16651.93s -> 16655.05s]  You said that my sub order was like a medium on the scale of how good something was?
[16655.85s -> 16662.44s]  That's all right. You could have said it sucked. You could have said, hey dude, your sub order is
[16662.44s -> 16684.30s]  dog shit. I know. I understand that. Medium. Okay. That's all right. All right. I don't even know
[16684.30s -> 16711.18s]  what the order is though. That was a good grenade. Holy shit. Nice work. Thank you.
[16719.94s -> 16740.18s]  Oh, that's a shitty place for that to be. We got to get at least the two zero, right?
[16743.03s -> 16757.08s]  Yeah. But what was the order? Was it the meatball sub? I mean a meatball sub is not my order. It's
[16757.08s -> 16777.98s]  one of a handful of a lot of sandwiches I like to eat. It's a griller. I got you. I got you. I got
[16777.98s -> 16847.54s]  you. Come to me. And one of the mods tell me what sandwich it was. Two grillers. God damn it. It
[16847.62s -> 16866.73s]  was the meatball sub. Oh my God. Who cares? We did it. Okay. First of all,
[16867.53s -> 16875.51s]  a meatball sub is by very definition a mid sandwich. That's not a bad thing.
[16878.20s -> 16911.24s]  Final wave. Okay. We'll get it. Hold on. Got it. Oh my God. All right. He's my ultimate, ultimate,
[16911.24s -> 16962.10s]  ultimate, ultimate. Anybody alive? Dude, I just saved us all. Holy shit. 30. Are you kidding me?
[16983.22s -> 16992.10s]  That was a lot. Okay. So what I was saying is a meatball sub is a very basic kind of
[16992.10s -> 17000.01s]  generic sandwich. It is mid by it's on its own. It is mid by default. I like meatball subs. I think
[17000.01s -> 17012.15s]  they're great. A little bit provolone. That's it. I asked you in the slime rancher stream. That's
[17012.15s -> 17033.19s]  what you answered. It depends on the day. Let me get to the next rank and then I'll do the other
[17033.19s -> 17045.35s]  game mode. Meatball subs are good. Yeah, I know. What's the problem? If you want to know what my,
[17045.35s -> 17049.99s]  one of my favorite sub sandwiches is. Okay. A cheesesteak, like a Philly cheesesteak
[17050.79s -> 17059.46s]  with grilled onions on it and a shitload of mayo. Ew. Quiet. That's up there pretty high.
[17063.85s -> 17071.98s]  A chicken cutlet sandwich, chicken cutlet, lettuce, tomato, fresh chicken cutlet. Holy shit.
[17074.89s -> 17102.86s]  Not much is better than that. Mayo, mayo. Gross. If you do not understand that mayo can seriously
[17102.86s -> 17107.86s]  bring out a bunch of delicious flavors and everything else, I just, I don't know what to
[17107.86s -> 17121.42s]  tell you. A chicken cutlet sandwich with lettuce, tomato, mayo. I need, I detailed answer of how
[17121.42s -> 17127.40s]  that doesn't taste fantastic. It's, I don't get, I don't get you. All right. I'm just shooting in
[17127.40s -> 17135.80s]  the air. I gotta play. Oh my God. I thought I actually got that. That would be amazing.
[17146.20s -> 17181.46s]  Deliver. Sorry. Let me get that last one. Sorry. Um, give it a try. Japanese mayo. Yes. It's
[17181.46s -> 17198.44s]  incredible. But you know what beats everything? I can't get these out here. I mean, I can,
[17198.44s -> 17229.67s]  I kinda can. I don't even want to talk about it. I seriously don't. Don't touch those. Oh my God. I
[17229.67s -> 17236.25s]  look like I just installed the game five minutes ago. Oh my God. I didn't, I promise I didn't just
[17270.14s -> 17285.22s]  just use this button thing. How did that not kill it? How did that not kill it? How did that not
[17285.22s -> 17292.41s]  kill it? No, that doesn't count. Let's talk about fucking like cream cheese and mayonnaise on a
[17292.41s -> 17310.17s]  sandwich. What's your Starbucks order? A venti cold brew with a little bit of oat milk or almond milk
[17310.17s -> 17331.98s]  and then three pumps of toffee nut. Get on my level. Oh, the sandwich I was talking about. Okay.
[17333.40s -> 17349.02s]  Have you guys ever had a buffalo chicken sub? Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah, man. I'm so pissed. I've,
[17349.82s -> 17355.34s]  they don't really like exist out here. You, they kind of do, but not like it is on the East coast.
[17355.34s -> 17383.67s]  Oh my goodness. There's so much better. Thanks. You got it. I have good.
[17454.60s -> 17463.59s]  Crispy chicken, not grilled chicken, crispy chicken, buffalo sub, blue cheese on it. Oh my God.
[17469.98s -> 17478.22s]  And I'm talking, I'm talking a joke worth of blue cheese. Whatever you think I'm talking about.
[17478.22s -> 17533.98s]  It's like a joke. Add more like you're doing a joke. Nice job. Nice job. Somebody's hurt,
[17533.98s -> 17584.23s]  but that's going to hurt. Oh shit. What happened here? That acted like mold and blue cheese is
[17584.23s -> 17587.83s]  disgusting. Yet would happily eat something like yogurt, which is live cultured bacteria.
[17587.83s -> 17598.06s]  It don't drink alcohol anymore. You don't, don't drink alcohol. Don't have kombucha. Don't have
[17598.06s -> 17640.18s]  kimchi. Don't eat that. I don't want any hypocrite Andes in here. Start. I can't see you.
[17645.64s -> 17674.66s]  Oh my God. What just happened? I think that guy. Thank you. Oh my God. What is happening? What's
[17674.66s -> 17728.55s]  this? The whole map just turned green. I'm going to play too. I did pretty bad that run.
[17728.55s -> 17739.40s]  Really bad that run. Um, but anyways, yeah. You know what else is awesome? A nice just
[17740.22s -> 17747.98s]  Turkey sandwich, Turkey lettuce. You know what else is awesome? Just a bunch of wilted up spinach
[17747.98s -> 17762.20s]  in a pan. This garlic sauteed lemon juice, a little bit of a little bit of salt. Oh my God.
[17762.20s -> 17801.03s]  Eat it. So insane. Saturday coming in for that cloud. Oh, I thought the helicopter was a fucking
[17801.03s -> 17836.23s]  bad guy. I'm staying up here. Yep. Come over. Come on. Eat that. Why can we not kill this thing?
[17836.87s -> 17858.87s]  Just leave it. Leave it. Leave it. This is bad. Did I get you? Oh my God. I threw it in the ocean.
[17859.83s -> 17897.50s]  I don't. Do you know what else is really good? This might actually be the thing I want to do
[17897.50s -> 17907.91s]  tonight. Pasta. Spaghetti. Angel hair. Get that shit al dente. Like eight, nine minutes. Maybe
[17907.91s -> 17919.53s]  like a little bit. I thought I could deseed. Something in my eye. Get it al dente. Shit load
[17919.53s -> 17926.17s]  of like a good, a good high quality olive oil. Dump, like dump the cup smothered in olive oil.
[17929.06s -> 17965.78s]  Salt. Done. Did I get it in? Angel hair sucks. Thank you. I'm going to quit the game.
[17966.42s -> 18011.64s]  I got it. You weren't dead. I wasn't. I thought I was dead. All right. This is it. Final wave.
[18012.28s -> 18043.19s]  Over here. I'll do the turning. I'll do the turning. I'll do the turning. I'll do the turning.
[18043.91s -> 18104.10s]  What's happening? What's happening? Oh, what do you mean low ink? It's full. It's actually full.
[18105.06s -> 18113.43s]  You knocked me out. I swear to God. I, I couldn't throw the, I just fucking throw the goddamn thing.
[18114.07s -> 18131.32s]  We win. Oh, all right. Let's actually do it this time. I understand how it works.
[18132.12s -> 18150.12s]  Give me some boost me, boost me, boost me, boost me, boost me, boost me, boost me, boost me.
[18150.92s -> 18173.85s]  What happened? What happened? Get the fuck out of my way. Oh my God. This is so frustrating.
[18174.73s -> 18212.09s]  We have so many things to throw. Where's this big bird? Dude, I can't, man. It's just, there's,
[18212.17s -> 18231.29s]  I can't, you can't even see what's happening. Throw the eggs. Dude, I can't throw the eggs
[18231.85s -> 18236.09s]  when I'm being puked on by 5,000 different enemies. They're all like,
[18237.05s -> 18244.25s]  stun lock, stun, stun, stun lock, stun lock. I can't even see. Dude, that's one of those
[18244.25s -> 18248.10s]  encounters that you have to be in a fucking vent call. You're going to be in a discord call to
[18248.10s -> 18255.02s]  even do that. It's going to be like, corner, corner, corner. Go, go, go, go. Yep. Like we
[18255.02s -> 18259.96s]  have to be all be yelling at each other. You're going to be in vent yelling at each other.
[18259.96s -> 18282.82s]  It's the only way that works. You'd get on vent. I'm going in, going in, going in. Okay.
[18283.94s -> 18298.81s]  I'm there, I'm there, I'm there. Remember that? My voice is just gone too. What happened today?
[18303.02s -> 18309.90s]  You have so many hats. Do I have way too many hats? Should I go look at them?
[18319.11s -> 18333.54s]  30 hats. What about Breath of the Wild? I'm borrowing my friend's Switch today.
[18334.50s -> 18337.54s]  We decided because he wanted to play Breath of the Wild for this weekend.
[18339.14s -> 18343.22s]  I want to play Splatoon and he had Splatoon and I had Breath of the Wild so we traded
[18343.22s -> 18358.30s]  switches for a weekend. I'll get it back. It's so fucking annoying though. His Switch is wicked
[18358.30s -> 18375.46s]  greasy. It's like stains all over the shoulder, fingers. Get me up here. I can't even play the
[18375.46s -> 18388.46s]  game. This is just shitty place. Okay. What happened? It's already explained what happened
[18388.46s -> 18418.44s]  right here. What did we all just get such shit on? Thank you. Dude, I can't, I have to leave.
[18426.50s -> 18434.68s]  Oh, time to join vent. Left square bracket, right square bracket, left square bracket, right square
[18434.68s -> 18439.64s]  bracket, left square bracket, right square bracket, left square bracket, right square bracket, left
[18439.64s -> 18451.70s]  square bracket, right square bracket, left square bracket, live have left the channel. Oh, come on.
[18460.14s -> 18467.18s]  You're so bad at this game. I'm currently in the overachiever level and I'm not invent and
[18467.18s -> 18471.98s]  it's my first time, first day ever playing Splatoon and I've got my friend's greasy ass
[18471.98s -> 18483.86s]  Switch in my hand. It's got a huge crack down the middle. You can clearly tell that it was next to
[18484.42s -> 18491.64s]  his bed. He got wicked tired and put it down over there in the middle of a Diablo 2 remastered
[18491.64s -> 18496.55s]  session and he got up in the morning and he didn't know it was there and he stepped on it with his
[18496.55s -> 18510.12s]  heel and cracked the screen. I actually did that to my iPad, except replace Diablo 2 remastered
[18511.18s -> 18550.58s]  with a cookie run kingdom or something. I don't know. Over here. I'm a team player.
[18551.14s -> 18600.10s]  You just got to get in the way. Don't even run into me. Oh, yeah. Don't even run into me. You
[18600.10s -> 18625.86s]  puke stain. Don't die. Fuck. We're going to get demoted again. I think we got really far.
[18625.86s -> 18631.16s]  We're all hitting gamer fatigue. We're hitting gamer fatigue and that's what's going on.
[18631.16s -> 18638.97s]  I've been playing with the same players for like an hour. It's gamer fatigue. It's all right.
[18639.77s -> 18677.93s]  We'll be fine. I'll go back to turf war. What's that? So I should swap for chunks. What about
[18677.93s -> 18707.24s]  this? Which one's better? Up to you. What am I looking at here? Keep it. Is it better? Run
[18707.24s -> 18730.71s]  speed up. But I don't know. Keep this. That's a triple. That's a triple right there. Where's
[18730.71s -> 18745.13s]  the triple? Didn't I just get a triple? Are you telling me that's all I got? We're playing that
[18745.13s -> 18766.14s]  game mode for two hours. I got 18 cents. I got 18 copper. All right. Let's do some other regular
[18766.14s -> 18779.16s]  game mode. Do I want to stay with this loadout? I think I'm okay with this. I don't think I
[18779.16s -> 18802.41s]  unlocked anything though. Yeah, I'll stay with this. This works. How much longer are you going
[18802.41s -> 18808.71s]  to stream for it? I don't know. Maybe like another 45 minutes hour. I'll get to like six plus hours
[18808.71s -> 18834.73s]  or so and then we'll be back on Sunday with a breath of the wild. Play the card game. I wonder
[18834.73s -> 18863.59s]  how much better I'll be at this mode now that I played that much. New map though. Where you at?
[18871.08s -> 18927.59s]  What are your thoughts on the game? It is a 9.9. Oh, at least I got it. That's going to be huge.
[18927.59s -> 18972.47s]  It's a 9.9, 9.8, 8.7, 7.5, 8.5. Sorry. I got a little weird. I might need to recalibrate.
[18973.35s -> 19007.38s]  Oh, you're in the enemy base. Let's go. It's all right. I think we still win. They're not going to
[19008.20s -> 19054.09s]  take this all the way back, are they? No. All right. Read my lips. What am I saying?
[19054.09s -> 19078.42s]  Yeah, let's go. Do the gumball machine. I probably can't be in a lobby. There's no way this isn't a
[19078.42s -> 19087.66s]  bit. What? Top fragging in Splatoon 3 and being the best player on the team. What's happening?
[19087.66s -> 19163.61s]  Where is everybody? Where is everybody? Where's their team? Can we get up there? Oh, that sucks.
[19163.61s -> 19204.52s]  I got it actually up in their spawn. I'm confused. Where is everybody? Got to wrap around real quick.
[19204.52s -> 19303.11s]  Number one turf anchor, number one super jump spot and number one ground traveler. Play the
[19303.11s -> 19310.84s]  card game. I feel like I'm just getting good at this. All right. Three more rounds with this
[19310.84s -> 19334.62s]  weapon and then I'm going to change weapons. You ever going to play this again? It's really fun.
[19335.18s -> 19344.68s]  I don't see why not. I just didn't get it. It's kind of like how I felt about Dark Souls before
[19344.68s -> 19362.02s]  I actually understood what it was. Try ranked. I don't know if I'm going to do ranked today.
[19362.74s -> 19416.92s]  This is a huge map. Don't you dare. Don't you dare. I hit every single button. I hit every
[19417.64s -> 19454.58s]  single button, but the right one. I didn't know how to detonate it. I forgot. Oh,
[19455.62s -> 19526.25s]  did I do that? That shit out of here. Come on down. Come on down. Come on down. First time
[19526.25s -> 19559.21s]  I've had the whole game. There we go. That's a win. There's no way I fell asleep and you're
[19559.21s -> 19565.99s]  still playing Splatoon. Have you even seen Sam and Run yet? Like Sam and the Food? What's that
[19565.99s -> 19616.09s]  person talking about? Sam and the Food? I like it. How do you do that? Let's go. I'm going to do
[19616.09s -> 19640.87s]  weapon change after this. This is the third one. See if I can unlock anything new. Bro, don't make
[19640.87s -> 19658.60s]  me get up there. Secure the kill. God damn it. Secure the kill. I thought there was somebody
[19658.60s -> 19718.34s]  next to me. There is. Oh, I walked into it. Surprise. We just doubled. Hell yeah. Oh, okay.
[19718.34s -> 19811.80s]  Nice cheating. See you. That's a win. Oh, no, it's not. It's not. What happened? They had their
[19813.16s -> 19830.62s]  mecha thing. All right, we're going to do a different weapon. New weapon. That was a good
[19830.62s -> 19871.93s]  fight. That was actually a good match. Sword Andy, what do you think? Would you recommend this game?
[19871.93s -> 19882.84s]  Yes, a hundred percent. In my mind, this was a six, but in reality, it's at least an eight.
[19948.73s -> 19953.45s]  I fucked up. I fucked up. My fingers got locked up with the gamer fatigue for like six hours.
[19953.45s -> 20011.00s]  Gamer fatigue. I got locked up. Shit, I got a direct hit too. Oh my God, we're getting destroyed.
[20011.00s -> 20033.11s]  This is a domination. I switch weapons. Look what happens. I switch weapons. Look what happens.
[20033.11s -> 20070.07s]  This thing's junk. I don't know where anybody is. Is it weird that the orange and purple
[20070.07s -> 20075.18s]  fucked with my head? It makes it hard for me to play. I feel like it's hard for me to see
[20075.18s -> 20093.72s]  what's going on. Anybody else like that? You're going to join the Valorant scene? No, dude, never.
[20093.72s -> 20123.46s]  No way. I want to buy a new weapon. Thanks, junk. You look unhinged today. God, I want a Buffalo
[20123.46s -> 20139.91s]  chicken sub so bad. All right, so what do we got? This is the better roller. Should I try the umbrella?
[20139.91s -> 20177.74s]  No, you know what? Let's try this. This thing seems pretty cool. It seems to have pretty good
[20177.74s -> 20213.91s]  spread. All right, so what's this do? Press R? Wait, what's going on? What is this? It slows
[20213.91s -> 20225.72s]  down. Oh, that's kind of good. Oh, that's who does that move. All right. Okay, let's try it.
[20225.72s -> 20256.44s]  Make some blues ink. Wrong button. Get some outfits so you don't look like a lame librarian.
[20256.44s -> 20299.58s]  It's a new outfit. I've had it for like an hour. So this thing, the target rises up. Kind of weird.
[20299.58s -> 20307.26s]  While you hold the button down, your cursor goes up. Where's that weapon? That thing looks cool.
[20307.26s -> 20379.74s]  A chainsaw? I don't know about this. I don't know about this. It takes too long. This thing
[20379.74s -> 20448.49s]  sucks ass. This is the worst weapon in the whole game. I'm fucking glad I used a Willy Wonka
[20448.49s -> 20546.94s]  ticket on this piece of shit. F here. This is what I'm talking about. This is a real weapon.
[20546.94s -> 20576.92s]  All right, let's do it. So are they ink or are they squids? What are they? We just came
[20576.92s -> 20618.81s]  out of a box. That was a good start. Use the vending machine. All right. After this match,
[20618.81s -> 20634.87s]  I'm going to go spend some money. Can you do a dab, please? It's a 2017. What do you want
[20634.87s -> 20689.75s]  me to do a dab? There's two people there. I would have won. They're grouping. They're grouping.
[20689.75s -> 20694.42s]  They're on a vent call. They're in a vent call. They're all in a vent call. They queued up his
[20694.42s -> 20749.75s]  party. Land. Come on, land. I really don't like that super. I think it's terrible. Oh,
[20749.75s -> 20804.44s]  you're so dead, man. I think we're getting kind of killed here. Oh, come on. Dude, where? I
[20805.48s -> 20824.55s]  can't see. Gamer fatigue. It's over. It's over. We lose. It's over. It's over. It was over when
[20824.55s -> 20859.69s]  it began. It was over. They were all in a fucking vent call. All right, one more and then I'm going
[20859.69s -> 20905.74s]  to go buy stuff. You almost lost a 4v3. The word you're looking for there is almost. All right,
[20905.74s -> 20922.26s]  I'm going to put my pants on for this one. I'm just not comfortable. You know what I mean?
[20941.58s -> 20944.54s]  Oh, I thought I was going to sneak behind and get everybody. That would have been insane.
[20944.54s -> 20979.03s]  Sometimes he says something that bypasses his brain. What do you mean? Stay alive. Stay alive.
[20979.03s -> 20990.90s]  Stay alive. Stay alive. Stay alive. Oh, this is bad. Come on. Come on. To me. To me. To me. To me.
[21008.71s -> 21053.96s]  Hey, did I explode in the mech? Oh, where'd you even come from? Hacker. I'm sorry. I keep
[21053.96s -> 21126.70s]  screaming into the mic. Come here, you little shit. Hacker. Oh, no, it wasn't
[21126.70s -> 21130.87s]  a hacker. I'm just kidding. I'm just got angry at the video game and I decided to call.
[21130.87s -> 21143.26s]  Just yell out something. Oh, I got a license. OK. All right. I'm going to buy clothes. Let's
[21143.26s -> 21150.31s]  head back to the clothing shop. I want to see what's here and then I'm going to do one more game.
[21150.31s -> 21155.38s]  I'll do the gumball machine. I'll do this. I'll do one more game. Then I'm going to end the stream.
[21155.38s -> 21198.47s]  It's a good time. Same clothes as before. The shoes different. No. Cool. How do I get to my locker
[21198.47s -> 21221.21s]  in the lobby? Right. How does this work? Five thousand. It's a cool 30,000. What are you
[21221.21s -> 21247.56s]  kidding me? Where's my where's my locker in here? There's a locker room over here.
[21247.56s -> 21390.58s]  What the fuck happened? It cancels literally everything if you press B. Minimalist style.
[21390.58s -> 21416.23s]  All right. Last one is the last one and then I'm done. I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[21416.23s -> 21420.07s]  Yeah, we'll do. I know I'm supposed to play Breath of the Wild today, but I didn't.
[21420.07s -> 21427.43s]  We'll do a full Breath of the Wild stream on Sunday. But when you have fun, you don't want
[21427.43s -> 21441.91s]  to get up. Have a good time. Just keep playing. Oh, this is a lot of water.
[21442.39s -> 21589.90s]  Oh, this is a lot of water. I forgot to hit the jump button. No, I hit a big oh. Holy shit.
[21589.90s -> 21644.44s]  Boom. Kid got this game for their birthday, dude. What the fuck? So did I. All right. That's
[21644.44s -> 21650.18s]  a good one to go out on. That's a good one to go out on. They weren't. Look, the teams weren't that
[21650.18s -> 21660.49s]  bad. Six hundred five seventy two. Oh, this game's great. This is a I highly recommend it. Very fun.
[21661.05s -> 21672.81s]  Very fun. And that's it. I'll see you later. See you on Sunday. I'll see you later, guys.
[21675.24s -> 21681.38s]  Sunday, we're going to do Breath of the Wild and we might finish it out with some split two and three.
[21681.38s -> 21701.93s]  It's possible. You never know. I'm very surprised. I will tell you for real. I did not think I was
[21701.93s -> 21710.79s]  going to like this game at all. I thought it was going to be kind of fun, but then it was really
[21710.79s -> 21729.48s]  fun. Breath of the Wild should be fun, too. I'm looking forward to it. These Nintendo games have
[21729.48s -> 21749.35s]  been been on point. I haven't had a complaint so far. If I do that salmon run thing again,
[21749.35s -> 21762.30s]  I definitely want to do with other people. Those later levels, you 100 percent need communication.
[21762.30s -> 21773.82s]  Somebody's got eyes on something at some point during the entire game. You need that skill issue.
[21773.82s -> 21776.46s]  Yeah. Well, if I play with three other people or two or three other people,
[21776.46s -> 21779.18s]  then there won't be a skill issue. We'll have communication. That's a skill.
[21779.18s -> 21797.45s]  I'll see you later, guys. Have a good rest of your night. Have a good weekend. See you on Sunday.
[21797.45s -> 21832.47s]  Call your mother. See you later.
