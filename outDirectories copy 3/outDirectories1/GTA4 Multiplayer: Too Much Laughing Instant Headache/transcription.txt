[0.31s -> 14.60s]  Are you trying to shoot me?
[14.60s -> 16.60s]  Kinda, I don't know.
[16.60s -> 20.54s]  You look like you're about to be painted.
[20.54s -> 24.54s]  It seriously looks like you're about to be painted by an artist.
[24.54s -> 27.91s]  Like, pose right there for me. That's beautiful, yes.
[27.91s -> 32.73s]  I like how I'm not even breathing or moving.
[34.73s -> 36.73s]  I'm like a statue.
[36.73s -> 40.35s]  You really are a statue.
[42.10s -> 47.79s]  Just stay like that the whole time.
[53.49s -> 57.49s]  I'm just delivering my statue to the art museum.
[57.49s -> 63.40s]  You still look like it.
[64.40s -> 67.40s]  Alrighty then, let's go get a helicopter.
[67.40s -> 70.83s]  Alrighty then.
[70.83s -> 73.83s]  My car right now looks like...
[73.83s -> 78.83s]  You know when your dog gets into one of your toys and absolutely ruins it?
[78.83s -> 79.83s]  Yeah.
[79.83s -> 82.83s]  It really looks like a dog chewed up this car.
[82.83s -> 87.26s]  It's like this is the most messed up car I've ever driven in.
[87.26s -> 89.26s]  Everything is exposed.
[89.26s -> 92.57s]  I'm at the airport right now.
[92.57s -> 96.64s]  Let me guess, that's you in that right now.
[96.64s -> 97.64s]  That is you.
[97.64s -> 100.64s]  Yeah, I can tell. What was that?
[100.64s -> 102.64s]  What was that?
[102.64s -> 104.64s]  What was that?
[104.64s -> 106.64s]  I just ran you over.
[106.64s -> 109.64s]  You just ran me over from behind?
[109.64s -> 111.64s]  I was driving so fast.
[111.64s -> 116.64s]  Dude, on my screen I just instant died. Nothing even happened.
[116.64s -> 118.64s]  I just felt like...
[122.10s -> 125.27s]  Look at these guys coming in.
[126.27s -> 131.24s]  What? What the hell was that?
[131.24s -> 133.24s]  What just happened?
[135.76s -> 140.06s]  What? What the hell was that?
[140.06s -> 142.06s]  The WASD and the number pad.
[142.06s -> 144.06s]  Where's my parachute? Where's my parachute?
[144.06s -> 145.06s]  Good, alright.
[145.06s -> 149.42s]  So meat, that thing is going to kill a lot of people.
[149.42s -> 151.42s]  I feel bad for whoever that lands on.
[151.42s -> 154.66s]  Oh my god, I'm watching it go down.
[154.66s -> 158.53s]  God, it's so scary. Who's it going to land on?
[160.28s -> 164.28s]  Alright, I'm parachuting down to the Empire State Building. Is that you right there?
[164.28s -> 168.55s]  Hey, what's up, stealth?
[168.55s -> 170.55s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[170.55s -> 172.55s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is not happening. You're not doing that.
[172.55s -> 175.11s]  You're not doing this.
[175.11s -> 179.64s]  I'm not even going to be able to land on this thing.
[179.64s -> 181.94s]  Stop shooting me, please.
[181.94s -> 183.94s]  No, this is not going to work! No!
[183.94s -> 187.18s]  Before we do that, let's hope it works.
[187.18s -> 189.68s]  I almost just fell off.
[189.68s -> 191.68s]  Alright, boo. Hold on to your hat.
[191.68s -> 193.68s]  What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
[193.68s -> 195.68s]  No, wrong way!
[195.68s -> 197.98s]  That was the wrong one again.
[197.98s -> 201.63s]  What is this like?
[201.63s -> 203.63s]  Alright, we're good. We're good.
[204.63s -> 207.63s]  You better not shoot me off at the top of this.
[207.63s -> 209.63s]  Oh my god, driving in sand.
[209.63s -> 211.94s]  I got it. I got this. Don't worry.
[211.94s -> 213.94s]  I got this. Don't worry.
[213.94s -> 216.94s]  Here we go. Ready? We're going to get up right now. Here we go.
[216.94s -> 219.43s]  Why are you just now getting in the door?
[219.43s -> 221.43s]  Oh my god, it actually worked!
[221.43s -> 223.43s]  It actually worked.
[223.43s -> 229.31s]  I thought you were just going to crash nose first and just stop still like driving into a brick wall.
[229.31s -> 232.31s]  Me too, but we Spiderman'd up the wall.
[232.31s -> 234.74s]  Alright.
[234.74s -> 238.30s]  Wow, this is like a challenge in itself. I feel like I'm playing Trials.
[241.10s -> 243.10s]  Alright, we made it to the grass.
[243.10s -> 246.10s]  I would describe this route as unconventional.
[246.10s -> 248.73s]  This is it, baby.
[248.73s -> 251.73s]  What's your guys favorite Kelly Clarkson song?
[251.73s -> 255.73s]  I really am sorry about this, boo, but this is going to be really, really funny.
[255.73s -> 257.73s]  Oh my dear.
[257.73s -> 259.73s]  No, I'm going to go off too!
[265.28s -> 277.46s]  Are you going to clear the building below you?
[277.46s -> 279.46s]  Yes.
[279.46s -> 281.83s]  Oh my god, you are right there.
[281.83s -> 283.83s]  I'm so tempted to shoot.
[283.83s -> 285.83s]  Oh, Jerma!
[285.83s -> 287.83s]  We're good. We're good. I'm good.
[287.83s -> 290.83s]  My helicopter is still below me, like where I landed it.
[290.83s -> 292.83s]  That's unbelievable. How did you do that?
[292.83s -> 295.83s]  Landed that? Very carefully.
[295.83s -> 298.83s]  Okay, so I just have to stay stable.
[298.83s -> 303.14s]  It's a stealth. You've got to be the judge. How close am I?
[303.14s -> 309.01s]  Pretty close.
[309.01s -> 311.01s]  Oh my god, you're like right next to it.
[311.01s -> 314.72s]  Should I jump into it?
[314.72s -> 316.72s]  I went through the blades!
[316.72s -> 318.72s]  You went through the blades?
[318.72s -> 320.72s]  How is that even possible?
[320.72s -> 323.72s]  How did you go through the blades?
[323.72s -> 326.09s]  Oh, no way.
[326.09s -> 328.09s]  Oh, Jesus.
[330.09s -> 332.09s]  No!
[332.09s -> 334.09s]  I looked away from my screen temporarily.
[334.09s -> 338.09s]  I look back up and I just see this toppling helicopter going instantly downwards.
[338.09s -> 340.52s]  Climbing up again.
[341.52s -> 349.01s]  Is that a cop right there?
[350.01s -> 365.18s]  Never there for the good stuff.
[369.70s -> 371.70s]  I do that. I spawned all the way back.
[371.70s -> 373.70s]  Oh no, I'm here.
[373.70s -> 375.70s]  What did you do?
[375.70s -> 377.70s]  Oh, my head. I have an instant headache.
[377.70s -> 379.70s]  I have an instant headache.
[379.70s -> 382.39s]  Is that a cop right there?
[382.39s -> 385.34s]  What did you do?
[400.14s -> 402.57s]  Alright, you guys are behind me.
[402.57s -> 404.57s]  Are you guys on the highway behind me?
[404.57s -> 409.30s]  Where are you guys?
[409.30s -> 411.30s]  You guys are literally within 10 feet of me.
[411.30s -> 413.30s]  Where are you guys?
[419.56s -> 421.56s]  How did you get that?
[421.56s -> 423.56s]  How did you time that so perfectly?
[423.56s -> 427.74s]  After I hit you, I did a 360 and just kept driving at the same speed.
[427.74s -> 429.74s]  How did you even hit me?
[429.74s -> 431.74s]  That was unbelievable that you actually connected with me.
[431.74s -> 433.74s]  I walked out in the middle of the highway.
[433.74s -> 435.74s]  I was like, where are you guys?
[435.74s -> 437.74s]  Then you just ran into me.
