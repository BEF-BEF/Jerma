[5.05s -> 32.46s]  I have returned. I'm back. Hi, how are you? Good day to you. Safe track. Hey, I'm the Warcraft guy.
[32.46s -> 49.74s]  You remember me? I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. NPR Andy. Yeah, that's really cool. And I did not
[49.82s -> 59.85s]  ever think I was going to be on NPR, but here we are. Crazy. Disney. Oh yeah, I've been all over
[59.85s -> 73.37s]  the place. And I'm not done either. There's a few things coming up here this, I want to say next
[73.37s -> 86.62s]  couple weeks, that there will be, you'll be able to see. Also, official planning of the Battle
[86.62s -> 95.00s]  Act stream is officially underway. I'm going to prove that once and for all. You'll see that
[95.00s -> 111.64s]  sooner rather than later. And today we are going to play Scorn. I've heard things about this game.
[112.79s -> 117.03s]  I've heard this game is not what everybody thought it was. I've heard this game is amazing.
[117.83s -> 121.99s]  I've heard it's like, it's an incredible experience. I've heard it's not what they,
[121.99s -> 131.59s]  somebody was expecting. I don't know. You're going to rage at this. I mean, I don't know.
[133.77s -> 138.33s]  It looks creepy. It looks cool. I'm into it. I'm ready to see like how cool it's going to be,
[138.33s -> 149.34s]  how scary. I saw the same trailer you did. Raid someone? I just turned my stream off at the first
[149.34s -> 155.90s]  time for like two weeks. But I also got something to talk about too. So you guys are going to get
[155.90s -> 162.06s]  something here on this channel. This kind of end of the week here. You are going to get three
[162.06s -> 171.38s]  streams in a row. It is Omega Gaming Weekend 2. But the only difference this time is it is a
[171.38s -> 177.94s]  contractually obligated Omega Gaming Weekend. So I can't delay it. I can't move it. And I can't
[177.94s -> 185.48s]  just do it one 14 hour stream. So I'm going to be contractual. You're going to get three streams in
[185.48s -> 192.60s]  a row because I'm contractually obligated to be here. I'm going to be playing Gotham Knights.
[193.32s -> 202.44s]  It's going to be sponsored by WP with three days in a row. And what that means
[203.08s -> 207.40s]  is not only am I going to be playing Gotham Knights for three days, I'm also going to be playing
[207.96s -> 215.43s]  other shit for three straight days. So we're going to do another Omega Gaming Weekend.
[216.15s -> 222.17s]  Maybe some Splatoon. Probably some Breath of the Wild. Maybe we'll sprinkle in some Sorcery. I know
[222.17s -> 235.75s]  people have been waiting for that. More Turmoil. No, yeah, I can't play Turmoil for eight hours.
[235.75s -> 242.86s]  It's not going to happen. And look, scary stuff too. I want to play the new Puppet Combo game.
[242.86s -> 249.05s]  We'll do that this weekend. It's not just going to be Gotham Knights, but Gotham Knights will be a
[249.05s -> 255.77s]  part of each one of these streams. And it's not and it's not like, oh, yeah, guys, I got up today
[255.77s -> 262.17s]  and like, I gotta have a headache and my back kind of hurts. I'll stream four days from now.
[262.17s -> 275.51s]  Nope. You should play Guitar Hero. I mean, it's been a long time. Oh, you bet. You better believe
[275.51s -> 285.03s]  I'm going to wear the Nightwing shirt. Yes, I am. 100%. 100%. Is it going to be Saturday,
[285.03s -> 291.83s]  Sunday, Monday? It's going to be Thursday, Friday, Saturday. So it's Omega, I don't know, Omega end
[291.83s -> 309.58s]  of the week. End. Kind of. You should play PS1 games. Maybe. I did that a while though. Yes,
[309.58s -> 313.98s]  I will confirm today. The most important announcement you'll hear on this channel
[313.98s -> 325.16s]  over the next six months. I will be playing Among Us VR as the sus guy, the day it launches.
[325.80s -> 340.94s]  I told everybody I promised him I would do it. And I'm going to. I promised. Now that means I
[340.94s -> 346.33s]  could literally play it for 10 minutes. But I was kind of thinking of really just cashing in on that
[346.33s -> 352.31s]  meme. And look, people are going to come to this channel when I stream that and just be like,
[352.39s -> 356.23s]  wait, this is the sus guy. So I'm going to brand the entire channel that way.
[357.03s -> 362.07s]  All the branding you see here right now will not be here that day. It's going to be the sus face
[362.07s -> 370.09s]  everywhere. The stream title is going to be the sus guy finally plays Among Us. All the emotes,
[370.09s -> 376.30s]  all the badges, they're going to be the sus face just for one day only. I'm leaning into this. I'm
[376.30s -> 389.82s]  cashing out on this meme. I get to. When does it come out? What day does it come out? Is it when?
[389.82s -> 403.43s]  Like, I don't know. I need to prepare for this. November 10th. You should keep you should have a
[403.43s -> 413.42s]  sus filter on. Wait, have the sus face on my face. But I talked about this, right? I was concerned
[413.42s -> 422.09s]  about this. Because if I do this, I'm going to break the dollhouse viewer record. You don't
[422.09s -> 426.17s]  understand what I'm saying? I will break the dollhouse viewer record. And I'll never be able
[426.17s -> 438.04s]  to do anything else. I'll have to be the sus guy forever. Okay, let me ask you this. This is what
[438.04s -> 444.36s]  an inflated ego. No, I'm just saying I'm just I'm preparing for the worst here. So if I do the sus
[444.36s -> 449.48s]  guy, and I rebrand the whole channel to be the sus guy, and I play Among Us, and there's like
[449.48s -> 456.12s]  80,000 people watching. And the next day, like 50,000 people are watching. And they're like, dude,
[456.12s -> 461.27s]  where's more Among Us sus guy? I mean, what am I? Should I just cash in for like a month?
[466.33s -> 471.93s]  But then all the long term people that have been watching this channel will just leave
[472.65s -> 478.01s]  and I'll go back to the normal viewership numbers that I've been seeing. And it'll all only be
[478.01s -> 486.49s]  Among Us sus guy viewers. I'm going to be in trouble here. Maybe I shouldn't do this. Well,
[486.49s -> 495.70s]  we'll see. It's gonna be a new community. That's so stupid. All right, let me tweet this. I'll be
[495.70s -> 550.04s]  right back. Good thing I got that one off. I had 1% battery. I think I got that on. Oh, RT game
[550.52s -> 559.59s]  with the raid. Hey, what's up? Spent some time with RT over the last few days here.
[560.15s -> 571.06s]  Good to see him again. Trying to actually go do things with friends and family. I've been
[571.70s -> 577.90s]  kind of just kind of in work mode essentially for a long time. So it's really nice to see a lot of
[577.90s -> 585.35s]  people. I'm so aloof you guys would not even know. You don't even understand. But hey, thanks to the
[585.43s -> 589.43s]  thanks for the raid. Saw Taleks hung out with Taleks again, too. That's cool. Good to see
[589.43s -> 604.18s]  everybody. Are you you played Overwatch 2 for 80 hours? I didn't. All right, you guys ready? No,
[604.18s -> 610.15s]  we're done stalling. It's time to play some scorn. That's what I imagine when I click on
[610.15s -> 626.49s]  when I click a new game here. It's gonna go scorn. Does it do that? And we're live. Does it do it?
[627.13s -> 681.22s]  When I click new game, is it gonna go scorn? Is that me? Scorn. Oh, Jesus loud. Hold on.
[681.22s -> 714.36s]  Oh, this game doesn't have any hints. Good luck. Well, that's what you guys are for.
[714.36s -> 731.75s]  I'll get them. I'll get them. So I asked this in pre stream. Is this a gug at a game?
[731.75s -> 743.64s]  Does it actually do we are we going to get some of that or no, it's not. What is it? It's a this is
[743.64s -> 748.74s]  a okay. No, it's not. Well, I'm not even going to explain that because the people that it's the
[748.74s -> 753.80s]  people that know, you know what I mean? The sensitivity is way too high. And by the way,
[753.80s -> 767.48s]  this FOV is controls sensitivity, right? Camera settings. All right, here we go. Way down. FOV.
[767.48s -> 777.85s]  What was this? This is a numerical value. What is what would this be? So what's 90? Am I at
[777.85s -> 781.59s]  90 right here? I wonder. I don't know. I feel like this I needed a numerical value here.
[781.59s -> 792.20s]  All right, let's try that. It's better. A little too low. I have to do my settings. Just wait.
[792.20s -> 807.72s]  That's way too high. That's still a little high, but it's better. All right. That's good. That's
[807.72s -> 825.11s]  fine. How's it look? Turn off mouse smoothing. Oh, smoothing. Okay. All right. So let's go.
[825.11s -> 829.74s]  I got to press this button. I got to figure out the puzzle. All right. So what I have to do is
[829.74s -> 842.90s]  I just woke up in a distant land that I'm not familiar with. Do I have a map? I mean,
[842.90s -> 857.51s]  the game looks really nice. Should I be not should I be walking? Right. I feel like I shouldn't just
[857.51s -> 905.69s]  be spinning around. This is getting scary. I turn it up. This is scary. It's crazy. How can I tell
[905.69s -> 917.69s]  if I can open these doors? Is it fall damage? Okay, I can't. I'm just gonna go down there.
[917.69s -> 940.42s]  Everything looks cool. I heard some move because it's just left click to interact.
[940.42s -> 945.78s]  Why does it look good? But also like a PS2 game. I think that's why I like it.
[945.78s -> 967.67s]  Let's think that. Is it filter? What do you mean filter? TOS? What do you mean TOS? What are you
[967.67s -> 981.59s]  talking about? Keep it on. I don't care. All right. Um, ignore it. All right. So I can't touch this.
[981.59s -> 991.78s]  I need to have. Whoa. That sounded fake. That was a fake. Whoa. It was. I have to admit to that.
[991.78s -> 996.78s]  That was actually fake. It's been like two weeks since I've been live guys. I got to remember how
[996.78s -> 1001.59s]  to like actually stream normally. That was genuinely. I made that up. Me saying, whoa,
[1001.59s -> 1006.39s]  I got caught. I actually made that up. So like I gotta, I gotta get back into this.
[1006.39s -> 1033.54s]  I forgot how to like pretend to have fun. What's this thing? Oh, whoa. That was real. It just
[1033.54s -> 1050.42s]  sounded a little deflated. Okay. So I have a thing on my arm now. What the hell? That's weird.
[1050.42s -> 1055.21s]  Is this toilet? This looks like a toilet of some kind. Like what is this? Is it an alien toilet?
[1055.21s -> 1079.96s]  All right. Well, it's definitely right here. Use direction. Wait, I don't get it. Okay. Wait,
[1079.96s -> 1099.99s]  I can switch between them. Okay. Just turn them both on. How do I get out? How do I get out of
[1099.99s -> 1112.54s]  the blood pressure reading machine? How? Oh, exit. Right. Okay. All right. There we go.
[1112.54s -> 1137.19s]  130 over fucking 70, dude. I'm fine. Yo, I didn't make it. Oh, come on. I have to keep it there
[1137.19s -> 1147.75s]  until. Okay. I need to stay in here. It's not just activate and walk away. It's activate. Stay in
[1147.75s -> 1160.30s]  here. Now we exit and we sprint. There we are. Okay. I get it. Give me an extra second or two.
[1160.30s -> 1177.54s]  So can I attack with this thing? I definitely have to climb up this thing. All right.
[1177.54s -> 1183.29s]  Get to the top of that and activate it. He's never going to complete this game.
[1183.29s -> 1188.62s]  That's what everybody says about every puzzle game that I've ever played. Okay. I'm going to
[1188.62s -> 1194.95s]  beat this. I will complete it. Everybody says that every time I play a puzzle game. Oh, hey,
[1194.95s -> 1200.23s]  dude. He's never going to beat this ever. And then I beat it. Like it takes me an extra four to six
[1200.23s -> 1222.46s]  hours than a normal human, but I still do. What is this? I don't know. I don't exactly know what
[1222.46s -> 1238.89s]  I'm doing here, but okay. I can, I don't know. All right. Whatever. Is it fall damage? Remember
[1238.89s -> 1273.26s]  you're an alien. What does this do? Okay. I don't get it. This game sucks. I'm done. I can push this,
[1273.26s -> 1285.32s]  right? Why does it tell me I can touch this? This thing's on a track. So how do I get it to move on
[1285.32s -> 1305.43s]  the track? It goes like this over here. And then what the hell is this thing? All right. So I am
[1305.43s -> 1312.84s]  on the track track moves like this. I've got this is correct because this, I want this to go down
[1312.84s -> 1318.95s]  here. Otherwise it would just spin around in a circle around this whole environment. So I've
[1318.95s -> 1325.70s]  already got it in the right place. I just have to move it and trying to figure that out. It's going
[1325.70s -> 1347.70s]  to be the challenge. Can I pick it up? What if I just leave it here? How do I activate this? How
[1347.70s -> 1357.69s]  do I get this move? Like go and take you forever? No, it's not. It's the first. I'm fine. I just
[1357.69s -> 1372.76s]  don't, I didn't know how to turn the thing on. Is this it? What is all this wacky shit in this
[1372.92s -> 1381.67s]  cathedral wherever we are? Do I have to get it here? All right, hold on. What is this thing?
[1381.67s -> 1411.37s]  How do I get the chair to move? Because this is, I did this correct. I just need to move the chair.
[1411.37s -> 1431.37s]  It's a two player puzzle. What? No, it's not. There's a lie. What can I do with this thing?
[1431.37s -> 1435.61s]  I am not going to be one of the people that said they quit this game in 10 minutes.
[1435.61s -> 1442.17s]  Because they thought it was going to be like, I'm not one of those people. I'm not quitting
[1442.17s -> 1453.93s]  the game in 10 minutes. No, I'm not doing it. Wait, what's this? Oh, I know what this is.
[1453.93s -> 1473.75s]  Okay, so can I move it? That's to get it to go up that way. Very obviously, I need to, I need to
[1473.75s -> 1488.92s]  figure out how to move the chair. I need to get that thing to fucking move that way. Is there like
[1488.92s -> 1498.06s]  a power thing I have to turn on? There's more places to explore. Oh, okay. I don't even know
[1498.06s -> 1506.76s]  where, I don't know what direction I came from. I'm just going to go this way. I need a map. Oh,
[1506.76s -> 1525.83s]  shit. Okay. I thought that was a concentrated puzzle. That's my bad. Okay, so what is this?
[1525.83s -> 1542.15s]  Okay, that's that scoops up whatever's in there. So what I need to put something in there to scoop
[1542.15s -> 1569.35s]  it up in here. All right. So how do I scoop some stuff in there? What should I scoop? Okay,
[1569.35s -> 1576.07s]  dude, what are you doing? Why? No, pick up one of these cubes. Pick up one of these. Scoop this
[1576.07s -> 1592.57s]  stuff. Okay, I can't do this. So they're both scoopers. Both are scoopers. And I can't use
[1592.57s -> 1602.42s]  them right now. So I'm gonna leave. I'm actually, I'm very interested in this game. I'm very
[1602.42s -> 1609.54s]  interested. I'll tell you right now. I'm not very good at puzzles, but I'm very interested in this
[1609.54s -> 1615.24s]  game. I want to know who the fuck I am. Why am I here? What am I doing here? Right? That to me is
[1615.24s -> 1622.98s]  worth me doing puzzles. I'm I want to know what I'm doing here. Who am I? Why am I here? Okay,
[1622.98s -> 1642.70s]  let me go this way. Can't activate these. All right, give me something. Give me like a bat,
[1642.70s -> 1652.49s]  a thing of meat or something to scoop, right? I've got nothing to scoop. I actually don't
[1652.49s -> 1670.79s]  have anything to scoop. There's all these scoopers and I can't scoop anything. You'll see. No help.
[1670.79s -> 1681.91s]  No help. No help. That's fine. I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out. When is he going to start
[1681.91s -> 1721.13s]  scorn? Scorning? What's this thing? I feel like get in this thing. It's like sod. This shit's so
[1721.13s -> 1734.26s]  weird. It's like this organic shit. You know what I'm saying? It's creepy. Organic tech. Weird.
[1734.26s -> 1758.92s]  Should I pick up like a like a skeleton or something and grind it up? I can hear something.
[1758.92s -> 1797.59s]  What's the point of this? Yo, what do I do? You beat Elden Ring yet? I got to the one of that
[1797.59s -> 1804.20s]  horse bosses the very beginning and I just puzzle games are like more my thing. So I quit it because
[1804.20s -> 1810.60s]  I just thought I'm not really into it. I'm more into like puzzle stuff. My game's just too fucking
[1810.60s -> 1827.80s]  hard. Like it's just, you know what I mean? I like stuff like this. Okay. Wait, what about here? I
[1827.80s -> 1834.23s]  already went down here. Okay. So very obviously I have to grind up something, put it into one of
[1834.23s -> 1841.03s]  the scoop machines and then the scoop machine will scoop out a, I don't know, something to use. I
[1841.03s -> 1850.10s]  don't know what to do. How come there's not every 15 seconds the game pauses and freezes and tells
[1850.10s -> 1861.35s]  me how to walk and like what interact button does. Okay. Try using your brain. I didn't think to do
[1861.35s -> 1877.62s]  that. All the rails. I just did that. Didn't I? There's the grind thing. All right. I'm going to
[1877.62s -> 1895.37s]  follow this one. Yeah. I, I, but how do I turn the cart on? I understand the concept of moving the
[1895.37s -> 1900.26s]  rails and changing the directions and everything, but how do I turn this? I'm just stupid. It's at
[1900.26s -> 1905.26s]  this game. I almost said stupid. I that's, I that one. That's not what I was going to say. How do
[1905.26s -> 1925.70s]  I turn the machine on? Explore more. Where have I not gone? I can't do this. It's gotta be something
[1925.78s -> 1948.81s]  to do. Maybe over here. Cause did I, did I go down here yet? I don't think so. No, I did.
[1948.81s -> 1990.86s]  I can hear a sound. Oh wait, what's this? What? Why can't I use this? What is this? You have to
[1990.86s -> 2005.42s]  pay attention to every possible path. I'm going to, I'm going to get a whiteboard in here. I'm
[2005.42s -> 2011.85s]  going to have to map this out. There's no map. There's no map. Somebody said you went down every
[2011.85s -> 2038.38s]  single path except for the correct one. That's not possible. You've literally did. There's an
[2038.38s -> 2054.41s]  elevator. What elevator? You keep missing controls. It's where the scoop is. It's,
[2054.41s -> 2067.96s]  it's the concrete level all over again. I just don't understand what I'm supposed to do.
[2067.96s -> 2073.64s]  Look, you guys are going to make me part of like a video essay on, look at how spoiled we've become
[2073.64s -> 2078.52s]  with all these developers giving us every hint we've ever needed. StreamerGerman985 couldn't
[2078.52s -> 2083.74s]  fucking find his way around scorn because there's no map and there's no fabled two breadcrumbs.
[2084.22s -> 2090.86s]  You guys are going to make me part of a video essay on how gamers need all this shit nowadays.
[2090.86s -> 2111.62s]  I could dodge a fucking axe on stream and I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna dodge a battle axe
[2111.62s -> 2119.98s]  on stream and you're not going to be able to say shit for months. You just ignored it again? What?
[2119.98s -> 2125.34s]  What? Where? What did I ignore? I don't get it. Everything is, everything is made of meat and
[2125.34s -> 2145.78s]  bones and shit. What am I missing? I missed something? Where? It's in here? Is this it?
[2145.78s -> 2164.26s]  It's in the snow. It's in the scoop room. No, it's in the scoop room. I don't, I don't. Guys,
[2164.26s -> 2168.42s]  if you paid me a million dollars to find the scoop room right now in 10 seconds,
[2168.42s -> 2177.24s]  I wouldn't be able to do it. Let's try. Let's see if I can get a million dollars. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,
[2177.24s -> 2183.48s]  5, 4, 3, 2. Well, that's not fair because it would have taken more than 10 seconds to get here.
[2183.48s -> 2188.52s]  What? Okay. Did I, did I get, did I make a million dollars? If I go straight from here,
[2188.52s -> 2208.89s]  did I get a million? Nope. I don't get a million dollars. That would have been such an easy million.
[2208.89s -> 2226.90s]  It's the same room. Okay. You're talking about the room that has the scoop machine in it. No,
[2226.90s -> 2230.50s]  I don't owe you a million. I just said if I got there in 10 seconds, I would get a million. It's
[2230.50s -> 2244.39s]  over here. It's not over there. Okay. All right. Where? Where? Oh my fucking God. I couldn't even
[2244.39s -> 2251.00s]  see this. I didn't even see this. This like just didn't exist in my brain. Everything's made of
[2251.00s -> 2270.02s]  fucking bones. I walked in here. Everything's bones and like sinew. Okay. I, it's hard to know
[2270.02s -> 2287.32s]  where I need to go. Nobody talk from the elevator. Straight ahead is the big room. Okay. Lock it in
[2287.32s -> 2290.92s]  straight ahead from the elevator. Big room, big room with a bunch of big shit in it.
[2290.92s -> 2298.98s]  Left from the elevator. Left is dinosaur rib cage machine. Left from left is dinosaur rib cage
[2298.98s -> 2308.31s]  machine. Got it. Locked in dinosaur rib cage machine. Big room on the right side over here.
[2308.31s -> 2314.46s]  On the right side, left is dinosaur rib cage area. Straight ahead is big room over on the right side.
[2314.46s -> 2329.54s]  We have hallway leading to a wires and then here we are leading to a um I don't know. I don't know.
[2329.54s -> 2352.04s]  Where does it go? This is on the right side. Remember. I don't remember this. It's alarming
[2352.04s -> 2360.90s]  how many message deleted there are. Okay. What does that mean though? How do I get into that room?
[2360.90s -> 2370.78s]  Where's my little fucking robot that's flying around that can be like oh of course go that way.
[2370.78s -> 2379.27s]  Now I think that if you go one meter to the left. Where's my inventory? Where's my a million ammo?
[2379.27s -> 2397.67s]  This is still on the right side by the way. You still have the first puzzle in your 40 minutes
[2397.67s -> 2401.91s]  into the game. No. No. The stream has been live for 40 minutes. I've only been playing the game
[2401.91s -> 2415.53s]  for about 20. Don't lie. Don't lie. Don't lie. It's been about 16 minutes or so. Okay so it's
[2415.53s -> 2421.40s]  just a big circle and there's nothing here. There's just this I don't know where I don't
[2421.40s -> 2427.16s]  actually don't know where I am. Did I do a few? Okay I did a big circle. There's the big room.
[2427.16s -> 2431.50s]  So it's a gigantic circle that goes around the whole thing. So what does this do?
[2431.50s -> 2473.42s]  What's this? God damn it. What is this? I don't even know what the what the object is.
[2478.46s -> 2482.30s]  Oh my god this is gonna be horrible. What do I need to do? I need to move this?
[2482.30s -> 2499.43s]  What? Shit. Okay do I have to get this all the way around the other side? I don't get it. Okay but
[2499.43s -> 2523.96s]  what's the goal? Is the goal to get the lit up light to move? Okay which ones can even move?
[2523.96s -> 2532.36s]  Okay they can only move into the holes. So then all right so can I go like this? I can't move this
[2532.36s -> 2541.75s]  down. Move this up? Okay wait now what if I do this? Can I pick it up with the other one? What
[2541.75s -> 2561.59s]  happens if I pick it up? Does this do anything? Okay so I have to get what about the other eggs?
[2561.59s -> 2573.72s]  The ones with the lights on them maybe? I'm imagining that this has to come up like the
[2573.72s -> 2582.66s]  ones with the lights. Is that what it looks like I guess? I don't know. I'm gonna try it.
[2600.46s -> 2621.69s]  Okay does that matter? Because that one has lights on it. I can't hear how that sounded.
[2621.69s -> 2628.17s]  It probably sounded really fucking bad. All right whoa whoa whoa what was that? I just I didn't even
[2628.17s -> 2634.65s]  I missed the in- who cares what my voice sounded like? What did I just do? What happened? It broke
[2634.65s -> 2648.44s]  and fell down. So that was not- it shattered and fell down there. It's a- all right well let me get
[2648.44s -> 2676.14s]  the other one. Oh that's really annoying. Okay um yeah out of the fucking way.
[2698.58s -> 2710.57s]  Shit! All right I have to get- this is- this is gonna move this one here. Where am I bringing it?
[2713.11s -> 2716.23s]  These are locked in place but can I move these? I can move these over here.
[2716.95s -> 2726.01s]  I don't think it's that complicated. Bring this all the way down. Bring this all the way up. Right?
[2726.81s -> 2737.70s]  Because this has- I have to get this out of the way. Let's go like this for now. I don't. So what
[2737.78s -> 2751.38s]  if I do this? Can I at least get this up here? I can. All right. There's that. But I have a new
[2751.38s -> 2816.25s]  problem. Problem solved? Kind of. This better be it. Did I do it? I mean not- it's close.
[2818.54s -> 2824.60s]  Uh okay I gotta go- we're gonna be able to go that way. Can I move this all the way down?
[2834.36s -> 2859.42s]  Fuck! All right what about- hold on. I think I got it. Yeah that's it. I got it. I hope this is right
[2859.42s -> 2890.22s]  otherwise I screwed this whole- no shit! I gotta- can I zoom in? This sucks. I think I- I think I
[2890.22s -> 2903.70s]  screwed the whole thing up because I can go over here but I can't go down. There's no scenario
[2903.70s -> 2914.25s]  where I can get this up here. I have to move everything. What needs to be moved? Somebody
[2914.25s -> 2930.28s]  said I hate this game. It's- it's- I'm playing it. Let me move this because I- there's an area where
[2930.28s -> 2951.75s]  I can get this down. Can I- can I move this? I can't move this up. I can't go across here.
[2951.75s -> 2964.86s]  I need to get that single one down here. Hold on. All this shit has to be out of the way completely.
[2965.42s -> 2976.15s]  Right? Like it has to be. There's no other way to do this. No no no don't move this yet.
[2976.79s -> 2989.10s]  So this now comes over here and comes down right? Then this comes over all the way over here.
[2989.82s -> 3012.90s]  Then I should be able to- no because this has to- wait I got it. Oh I got it. We're good. Oh thank
[3012.90s -> 3034.42s]  god. Okay. I hope this is right. Average thinker. I'm- I got it. I'm fine. What are you doing? What
[3034.42s -> 3073.67s]  do you mean? I'm gonna have to grind this thing up. I'm gonna have to grind that up. Yeah okay I get
[3073.67s -> 3092.76s]  it. It's a wild puzzle. Oh man puzzles. What I'm known for here. So back down into that room
[3093.40s -> 3102.70s]  where the um kind of the saw is. Doritos. No it's not gonna work this time. It's not gonna work.
[3108.58s -> 3119.40s]  Okay I'm imagining I have to take- it probably came down this side right? Burn this into my
[3119.40s -> 3129.37s]  brain. This image right here. Okay I got it. So that means that this is where the scooper is.
[3129.37s -> 3141.80s]  If I see this exact image with like the thing hanging in over there. Okay stop saying Doritos.
[3141.80s -> 3174.90s]  It doesn't mean anything. What is going on? What is that sound? Where is it? Oh shit it's above me.
[3174.90s -> 3244.34s]  All right wait where's this going? This is gonna go over here. So where do I want this to end up?
[3244.34s -> 3257.59s]  So if it stays on this track which it could it could it's gonna go in here into the scoop room
[3257.59s -> 3265.51s]  which I don't think I'm ready for that yet right? I think I need to to put the I need to um use the
[3265.51s -> 3274.02s]  blade. I think that's what I have to do. So let me see where that is because where is it over here?
[3274.02s -> 3281.13s]  I gotta get into memory. All right so I need to move that- where is this one going? I gotta close
[3281.13s -> 3290.63s]  that up and see where this is. What's this over here? Track will go over here, through here,
[3290.63s -> 3305.53s]  around the corner, into- here it is. All right so uh okay let's- I'm gonna go move the tracks.
[3305.53s -> 3318.34s]  How's it- why is everybody saying yay and nay? All right so I gotta close up that one back here
[3318.34s -> 3326.38s]  because you know what I mean I have to move this. So this one is already correct but I have to close
[3326.38s -> 3340.87s]  this one. So this one has to come back over this way. So close up that one and that's the only one
[3340.87s -> 3371.80s]  that needs to be closed. Yes all right that's good. So it's where- where is- where am I?
[3371.80s -> 3383.35s]  It's this one over here. Where's it going? Okay so that's what I need. That's correct. We good?
[3383.35s -> 3419.42s]  Let's go. Let's go. All right begin. Move. What are you doing? He's reaching. What's going on? Wait
[3419.42s -> 3430.78s]  what? No no I want to keep going on this track. Can I do this? Let me see what this does.
[3447.29s -> 3492.62s]  What did I do? What did I just do? I don't know. I- this feels like I shouldn't be doing this.
[3504.95s -> 3510.15s]  Okay well we're going this way and then this wraps all the way around and then it's the-
[3511.05s -> 3535.34s]  the- should I- I don't know should I put him in this thing? Okay.
[3535.34s -> 3571.22s]  Okay now what? Now I- I- do I have to pick it up? Dude what the fuck? No no no no stop go back.
[3584.60s -> 3600.12s]  Wait a second. Okay now I can click. What the fuck? Wait they go in- what's the point of doing this
[3600.12s -> 3610.12s]  though? What is the point of this? What- what's the point of this? Why would I do this? What's the point?
[3637.62s -> 3671.22s]  What the hell? Hey wait he's getting up. Should I run? I feel like I've been- the game has given me
[3671.22s -> 3681.94s]  an opportunity to run away before this guy Michael Myers is me for like the next six hours. Help him.
[3681.94s -> 3695.21s]  I- I- how? What am I supposed to- why is that sound effect happening? Why is that sound effect
[3695.21s -> 3730.52s]  happening right now? Help him please. How? Can I like- standing? Yeah. Am I supposed to do something?
[3730.52s -> 3752.76s]  Oh wait no no no no no no. Walking? Walking? Wait you're just- are you following me? Okay um so now
[3752.76s -> 3784.39s]  we're gonna go sit you in the- in the scoop machine and get- get you scooped up. Careful. Can he use
[3784.39s -> 3790.78s]  this? This would make sense right considering that this two- this is the- yeah this is co-op partner.
[3790.78s -> 3827.56s]  Yep. What do I do? How do I help him? Wait what? Jesus dude. Oh my god.
[3828.36s -> 3846.26s]  Ah you're gonna need a gun. Let me give you the- let me just take a look go into my menu and find
[3846.26s -> 3850.66s]  the thing with zero ammo and the gun that I never upgraded and it's a pistol with maybe one bullet
[3850.66s -> 3879.43s]  in it. Here take it. So let's try- let's get- let's get that big door open right here. Come on. You
[3879.43s -> 3897.88s]  didn't even give you a new friend a name? I- we just met. I got a- I don't know. After a little
[3897.88s -> 3907.27s]  while I'll come up with a good name. All right come over here and touch it. Go come and put your hand
[3907.27s -> 3920.55s]  over here. All right come on come over here we'll get this open.
[3933.77s -> 3960.70s]  Dude this sucks. This is like fucking horrible. So this is open. All right so stay right there
[3960.70s -> 3983.77s]  for a sec. Did you just lock me in here? I was just about to give uh I was about to give you a
[3983.77s -> 4014.63s]  name too. No you locked him in there. It's gonna be some like AI took control and has been killing
[4014.63s -> 4044.26s]  us. I don't know. It's some- it's gonna be some alien alien tech. You know what I mean? Yeah humanity
[4044.26s -> 4050.87s]  is being like harvested by the aliens and they're using a- they're using us for their alien tech.
[4050.87s -> 4122.60s]  What was that? That's creepy. Ace in there? He's gonna break open. All right room with all these
[4122.60s -> 4137.02s]  pods. Can I do anything with this? Looks like a quake map. Wait what am I doing with this mine?
[4137.02s -> 4216.74s]  Okay uh all right up there. I knew it. Fucking alien tech. I don't know why I think that's funny.
[4217.70s -> 4224.82s]  It's just- I don't know it's just a word. Am I inside of a thing that's just alive or something?
[4224.82s -> 4241.83s]  This thing's alive. What does this do for me? What does this do for me? I don't know. I don't get it.
[4241.83s -> 4252.25s]  Um I guess I can turn this a different way or- no I can't. What else is in here? Can I move this?
[4254.20s -> 4271.85s]  Okay I can move this again to there? I don't know. I'm gonna try it. You're- oh I'm so sorry
[4271.85s -> 4282.86s]  that probably hurt your ears. Have you ever seen alien? Yeah um let me- do I just get another one
[4282.86s -> 4291.34s]  and put it somewhere else? Do I have access to any more of those? I saw those things sticking out.
[4291.98s -> 4295.98s]  I definitely have access to more of those things. Right? I gotta place them here. I think I know
[4295.98s -> 4304.92s]  what I have to do. Let me get out of here. All right. There's more of those um uh uh the alien
[4304.92s -> 4315.51s]  tech globes. Do I have to pick one up and put it over here? Or do I have to pick that? I would
[4315.51s -> 4323.59s]  put it in here. I don't know. That's what I'm going with. That's what I think I have to do. So
[4323.59s -> 4336.17s]  I'm gonna try it. What is it back here right? Yeah okay. So can I just pull one of these off?
[4336.17s -> 4344.20s]  I gotta be- this is gonna be a way to get that off right? Something to do with this
[4344.76s -> 4347.99s]  but I don't have whatever that uh attachment is or something yet.
[4349.45s -> 4363.54s]  Huh okay. So that's not what I have to do. Uh oh. Seeing a lot of not like this. Go back. Go back.
[4368.89s -> 4376.86s]  So do I just pull it out of there and then put it in one of the other slots?
[4376.86s -> 4389.80s]  That's what I'm thinking. It looks like I couldn't do that though. All right I'm gonna look over here.
[4389.80s -> 4412.39s]  Is there anything else? Is this a big circle? Oh oh found one! How do I get that? How do I pick
[4412.39s -> 4431.22s]  this up? I can't pick this up. I need more- you need more alien tech. Okay there's another one.
[4431.22s -> 4439.14s]  All right it's a big circle so I've obviously this is not done here yet. I need to go somewhere else.
[4439.14s -> 4444.82s]  I guess. I feel like it's that's the thing that's powering that stuff. I'm just gonna go back.
[4444.82s -> 4459.10s]  Is this here? All right I need to lock this into memory. That's that way. When are you gonna get a
[4459.10s -> 4463.75s]  rocket launcher? I don't think I'm gonna get one of those. All right this is where I came from.
[4463.75s -> 4473.37s]  So what- is there anything over here? Now this is where I was.
[4476.12s -> 4489.13s]  Did I miss something else? I guess I could go over here back with this.
[4490.09s -> 4494.23s]  God I'm so sorry. Holy shit that was that was like the worst thing that ever happened to me.
[4494.23s -> 4504.17s]  That was actually the worst thing that ever happened to me like my whole life.
[4504.17s -> 4513.02s]  It was- it was just a- it was like a weapons case appeared. So much shit has not happened
[4513.02s -> 4517.10s]  that I did not think that the weapons- whatever. Oh I got- oh we're ready to rock and roll. It's
[4517.10s -> 4531.22s]  time. Start playing the Guggernaut. Does this have ammo? This is the shittiest jump scare I've ever
[4531.22s -> 4555.00s]  had. Whatever. Does this have infinite ammo? This thing sucks. It's like a party horn.
[4558.76s -> 4575.82s]  Oh I'm out of ammo. So what do I do with this? So I take this back to there and I start- I can
[4575.82s -> 4630.65s]  put this- okay I know what to do. This is gonna go right here. Oh cool. There we go. Okay so now
[4630.65s -> 4643.74s]  I go over here and I- they're all gonna be over here now. What? Did I supposed to do that? Oops.
[4649.99s -> 4650.49s]  Hey!
[4671.88s -> 4689.34s]  Too high. Okay. Did one of them fly over here? Oh look at that. Okay cool. I know what to do now.
[4689.34s -> 4720.57s]  Let's get it. We pick that one up. Stick it over there. Go! There we go. So where should I put it?
[4720.57s -> 4730.84s]  Spaces open up there. This is space right here. I'm just gonna put it here. I think. No I'm not.
[4730.84s -> 4770.02s]  I'm gonna put it where the thing opened. All right. And there's one more. Taking my blood
[4770.58s -> 4782.20s]  something. That's definitely using my blood to power. Well I got it. Aliens are using human
[4782.20s -> 4788.31s]  blood as oil to power their machines and shit. Like our blood is oil to the aliens right? It
[4788.31s -> 4802.26s]  has to be. Okay so this is here. There's another one. I gotta get- I have to crack down another
[4802.26s -> 4841.72s]  one of those lobe things. Where am I gonna get this last one? Oh the French champagne.
[4841.72s -> 4887.58s]  There we go. All right. I should be able to open them all now. Get to it. See you later. See you later.
[4889.82s -> 4908.55s]  They're not gonna fucking harvest us. Dude those are just air conditioners.
[4909.43s -> 4917.69s]  Relax. You bastards aren't gonna harvest us anymore! Because you know he's talking to a
[4917.69s -> 4939.93s]  fucking like air conditioning tube. Yeah you bastards! They were literally just cleaning stuff.
[4951.10s -> 4976.04s]  Dude you're speaking to a Roomba. Overloaded it with blood. I overloaded it with too much blood.
[4986.15s -> 5025.62s]  What the hell is going on? What the heck? I'm in a different like world. One sec. Otto is chilling
[5025.62s -> 5040.94s]  in here. I'm gonna let him out. Wait hold on. Why am I like being born or something? This is weird.
[5041.66s -> 5069.21s]  Wait it actually is the birth canal. Wait what? What the hell is going on in this game? All right
[5069.21s -> 5127.58s]  give me one sec. I have returned. All right so I've been born. Did I rip that out? That was
[5127.58s -> 5141.90s]  the worst time to leave. You- did I- whatever. It's fine. I don't care. You missed it. I don't-
[5141.90s -> 5157.19s]  whatever. I don't- I didn't miss anything! You missed lore. Vital lore. It was a graphic umbilical
[5157.19s -> 5163.27s]  cord removal. Oh whatever. All right well this is different. This is- I came out of the wall.
[5165.69s -> 5175.93s]  There's other uh scorns here or whatever is going on. Let's go this way. Yeah we'll be- we're being
[5175.93s -> 5188.58s]  harvested and it's like- anybody seen the matrix? What a dumb question. I bet you're like everybody
[5188.58s -> 5204.50s]  probably has seen that. That's what it kind of feels like. Anybody- hey anybody seen the matrix?
[5208.79s -> 5227.50s]  No dude. You're the only one. You're the only one. Like a ship? This is a different planet. Did we
[5228.70s -> 5238.47s]  land on this planet in search of something or contact and we ended up- we woke up this-
[5239.11s -> 5258.89s]  what is that? Is this backwards? This is backwards. This is backwards. Is that backwards?
[5258.89s -> 5293.03s]  This is- I'm wrapping back around here. This is where I came from. Did I go all the way back?
[5293.67s -> 5299.99s]  That- I just wanted to circle. What about this way? Can I go this way?
[5301.45s -> 5318.54s]  It didn't look. No. Hey Jerma it's Dave from Mensa. I want to know that we've rejected your-
[5319.94s -> 5335.80s]  oh it's like a I'm dumb thing. Okay this is really cool though. The atmosphere is definitely on point.
[5337.34s -> 5380.58s]  Atmosphere? Nine. Weird. One of these is gonna get up. What's my goal here? I'm just walking
[5380.58s -> 5411.00s]  around aimlessly. Okay I could go down over here. It's a cute game. All right let's go.
[5411.24s -> 5471.14s]  I'm ready. It's like ships. Are these gravestones or like alien pods? Alien tech. Oh that's right.
[5471.78s -> 5484.17s]  That does what it is but that looks like. I don't- I don't think this- I don't think this one made it.
[5484.17s -> 5522.97s]  I think I gotta go in here. Is there a door? Like a front door? Oh something over there.
[5522.97s -> 5536.15s]  Is that something glowing? All right hold on. This is the Futurama house.
[5540.54s -> 5546.86s]  That was- yeah that's- that's really good. That's like how did you- how would you even-
[5547.42s -> 5560.78s]  It's right though. Like you- you're completely accurate. It just is. All right I think I found
[5560.78s -> 5577.03s]  a way in. This is one of those games where the graphics are so pretty. It's so- it's such a
[5577.03s -> 5582.87s]  beautiful game in regards to uh human tech. I'm not talking about alien tech. I'm a graphics of
[5582.87s -> 5590.66s]  humanity. Uh the human tech on this is great which makes it way more unsettling. It's like
[5590.66s -> 5606.97s]  too real. It's like just all the graphics are good. Like really good so it just makes it worse.
[5606.97s -> 5622.86s]  All right so I don't know what this is. This thing is gonna start moving. It's gonna be all
[5622.86s -> 5674.86s]  the organic shit. This is alive. Oh god it's a lizard person. All right do I have to fight that
[5675.58s -> 5722.44s]  or hide from it? This is so weird. Oh god okay um honestly this is what I would do in real life.
[5727.54s -> 5740.81s]  That's what I would do in real life. I would get freaked out and fucking run away. I did it
[5740.81s -> 5753.42s]  and all the time all the while I'd be running and like clapping very very loudly. New uh my hand.
[5753.42s -> 5787.42s]  It's saying I can touch it. Can I now put my arm in this? I guess I can't touch this right now.
[5787.42s -> 5794.86s]  All right let me get this into memory here. Oh my god wait where's the thing? Where's the monster?
[5797.78s -> 5838.78s]  All right that's glowing red room. Remember that. Glowing red room is that area. I don't have
[5838.78s -> 5874.46s]  whatever this is. Interesting. I can't do anything over here. What do you think this smells like?
[5874.46s -> 5892.84s]  Um okay you know that basement smell? That really heavy basement smell. I'm gonna say like that
[5892.84s -> 5918.09s]  and cheese. Okay so where am I supposed to go? The shadow I thought was the monster. Um could I have
[5918.09s -> 5925.24s]  done something with that? I just don't didn't see it. Or is there another way to go? It didn't look
[5925.24s -> 5937.48s]  like I could interact with anything in the red room. Oh you know what? No no basement and like
[5937.48s -> 5949.22s]  something that has been something burning. That's what it smells like down here. Red room. Red room.
[5949.22s -> 5969.72s]  I can't touch anything in here. Red room. Red. How do you do it? Let me see if I can do it.
[5972.90s -> 5995.11s]  Red room. Red room. Red room. Pretty good. Pretty good. Pretty good. Um there's nothing back here.
[5995.11s -> 6020.92s]  Maybe go back out to the other. Out to the other area. Please tone it down. My kid's trying to
[6020.92s -> 6036.50s]  sleep. What headphones is it? And why? This is a scary thing to have on the tv. I'm gonna go back.
[6036.50s -> 6063.74s]  I'm gonna get out of here. You keep walking right by it. Dude don't even tell me I'm doing that.
[6063.74s -> 6077.80s]  No that's down there. Can I go down? I can't go down here. I keep walking. I keep walking by it.
[6077.80s -> 6083.94s]  I didn't. This is the first skeleton person I've been able to interact with. How am I supposed to
[6083.94s -> 6094.44s]  know I could touch this? How am I supposed to know I could grab this thing? You know what?
[6094.44s -> 6151.51s]  Monka S. Monka S chat. Open up. Did they get it? But what did that do? Oh it's just the wires cut.
[6151.51s -> 6201.74s]  This doesn't this is not connected to anything. Wait is this creepy? Um oh hey hey hey what the
[6201.74s -> 6214.49s]  fuck? What the hell was that? Okay well this is that. This is that. This is that. So I could have
[6214.49s -> 6233.99s]  used the elevator. Okay this is that. The red room. I need to come back to the red room. I'm
[6233.99s -> 6263.30s]  imagining I have to open those three things. Okay now we're up. Oh god. Little weirdo. All right
[6263.30s -> 6349.10s]  what's over here? Nothing. I like this game. Whoa okay. Oh fuck. Dude look at all this over
[6349.10s -> 6358.63s]  engineered alien tech. Wait why am I I can do this from both sides? Wait hold on. I'm confused right
[6358.63s -> 6366.84s]  now. What just happened? Wait what would I do? I'm confused. What's going on? Just make walkways.
[6366.84s -> 6371.64s]  Yeah it's true. This over engineered alien bullshit. Just make walkways. Why does this
[6371.64s -> 6486.47s]  shit have to exist? This is just overdoing everything. Uh oh. I don't get it. Okay so there's
[6486.47s -> 6505.70s]  red room. I have a key now. Probably for this. Whatever this is. Yep. Oh boy. If I said it's my
[6505.70s -> 6519.75s]  turn to use the xbox would you guys think that was funny? Oh I don't have one of those things on.
[6519.75s -> 6532.95s]  All right so I gotta get one of those arm uh augments. Come back over here. Into the
[6532.95s -> 6539.50s]  middle of this thing. Use it. So I have this this key now. I can probably use that. Back down the
[6539.50s -> 6550.68s]  elevator. Use that in the red room. What side is this on? I don't even know where I came from. Over
[6550.68s -> 6579.91s]  here right? So this is the leftmost um pod right? Oh how do I get out of here? So then it would be
[6579.91s -> 6612.30s]  the rightmost one. Is it this one? Oh shit. Okay hold on. Can I make for them? Whoa what happened there?
[6613.30s -> 6674.46s]  Oh um I definitely have to turn that off. Oh pull them all. One two three. Got them all. All right
[6674.46s -> 6749.19s]  cool. So that's a shortcut. That didn't work. Holy shit. Huh? All right that's weird. Oh he's just
[6749.19s -> 6770.06s]  ugh. Okay so I'm gonna go out of here. What can I do with this? I can go through the blades? Let's
[6770.06s -> 6780.63s]  try that. I'm eating. I mean I'm I'm playing scorn but I am very overexposed over here.
[6780.63s -> 6802.30s]  Aren't I? I'm like look at them. They're bright. What's going on here? Is that better? Lights off.
[6802.30s -> 6820.14s]  Lights off but it'll look weird. Right? Is it gonna look weird? I turned the lights off and somehow
[6820.14s -> 6824.90s]  this is what happened. I don't understand what just happened. Why did this happen? Why did the
[6824.90s -> 6857.54s]  webcam just break? Hold on. It's because like auto exposure. Um give me one second. Dude why does
[6857.54s -> 6890.86s]  this look so fucked up now? Am I at 60 fps at least? Hold on. That's 2008 scorn playthrough.
[6890.86s -> 6908.62s]  Um I don't I don't know why it's doing this. I guess I could do this. Why is it so frame ratey?
[6908.62s -> 6916.30s]  Dude what is it with? Somebody explain this to me. What is it with webcams that they just they go to
[6916.30s -> 6924.92s]  2 fps if the like exposure is brought up. It's like does this thing only operate on an auto shutter
[6924.92s -> 6930.84s]  that can never be fucking overrided and you need like six floodlights to make it even look remotely
[6930.84s -> 6943.88s]  good looking. Why is it slowing the shutter speed? Just put the gamma up bro. Okay well this is
[6943.88s -> 6958.68s]  obviously not going to work. So let me go back to what this looked like before. I mean computers are
[6958.68s -> 6983.29s]  stupid. Why I'm like orange. Why am I so orange? All right that's better. That's that's a little
[6983.29s -> 6992.25s]  creepier. Right? There. There you go. All right we're good. This is like scary lighting. Right?
[6993.66s -> 7006.73s]  Okay let's go. You're still in the tutorial. I'm not in the tutorial actually. Is this quick
[7006.73s -> 7021.00s]  size yet? This thing is so bright now I can't even see the screen. It's like oh my god. I
[7022.28s -> 7047.10s]  just put like six lights in your face. Is this is a shitty frame rate? Is it that it's still okay?
[7047.10s -> 7063.27s]  We good? It's definitely shitty frame rate. I swear to god. I swear to god all these webcam
[7063.27s -> 7071.50s]  companies have not upgraded the technology since 2006. I promise you. I don't think they've updated
[7071.50s -> 7085.42s]  the chips inside of these things since like 2007. I don't I don't think so. I don't think so. So
[7085.42s -> 7098.26s]  this is where I was. I want to go back out to where the fan is. Isn't it so weird that ever since I
[7098.26s -> 7106.47s]  got the that old like I got this this old Logitech webcam. I remember using it. It was like a C like
[7106.47s -> 7116.47s]  20 or something. Right? It looks identical to this. That was 10 fucking years ago. It was
[7116.47s -> 7132.97s]  literally 10 years ago. In fact it looked better. All right I'm gonna play. All right so here's this.
[7132.97s -> 7154.52s]  This is a shortcut through the blades which puts me here. Okay so that is just an easy way to get
[7154.52s -> 7164.65s]  back to there. Right? So let's do this. Does this do anything for me? Didn't I already do this though?
[7164.65s -> 7238.33s]  Wait what's going on? Why am I doing this again? Do I have to do this again? Stop. I mean you look
[7238.33s -> 7244.41s]  like you're covered in cheeto dust. I don't know. This is a Logitech brio. I think this thing was
[7244.41s -> 7267.34s]  a hundred fucking dollars. This thing was expensive. Okay so I got that. I don't know why this thing is
[7267.34s -> 7285.56s]  so bad. Okay so I can't go this way. So I have a new thing. Back to the red room. Right? So I'm
[7285.56s -> 7296.22s]  going to try to do. So let me go back here. Yeah I think I am just going to set up my that DSLR.
[7296.22s -> 7325.86s]  Okay so I got that. Cool. Let's go here. What is that? Can I touch this? Oh nice. All right I
[7325.86s -> 7354.09s]  got the thing now. Do you have an intentional orange filter on? Okay so this opens. This is
[7354.09s -> 7359.27s]  another shortcut. So I'm kind of just opening up this whole area which is good because now
[7359.27s -> 7368.47s]  do I need to do? No I did that one already. So I gotta go back to red room. Right? That's the idea.
[7368.47s -> 7390.92s]  Okay red room. Red room was around the corner here. Where's the red room? Where's the red room? Down
[7390.92s -> 7414.92s]  here? Dad's over here. Okay. Can I like practice or something? All right. I have a new code. All
[7414.92s -> 7421.80s]  right. So I gotta get. There's another one. There's one more I gotta get. Yep. I gotta get
[7421.80s -> 7439.42s]  one more. What is the axe stream? You'll see. You'll see. Okay so very obviously I gotta get
[7439.42s -> 7446.60s]  one more of those and where the hell is that? That's a great question. So I'm missing one code
[7446.60s -> 7465.86s]  for my power glove. Whatever it is. Okay so where would that be? Probably up where I was
[7465.86s -> 7473.30s]  because now I can wait. Uh-huh. I can go back. I have the thing for my arm. Let me see if I can
[7473.30s -> 7481.53s]  backtrack to where I was. I got the thing for my arm which I need that to go up this way. I got
[7481.53s -> 7502.23s]  the thing on my arm. Right? And then I did that and this is the fan unplug. No. Wait. How do I get
[7502.23s -> 7523.53s]  back to? How do I get back to that area? The other elevator. Because I put my hand in this right? So
[7523.53s -> 7543.94s]  now I can use the thing. Where were the fans dude? I just don't fucking remember. I just really don't.
[7544.02s -> 7563.46s]  I feel like it was like no this is it in this way because that's the red room. This is going back.
[7563.46s -> 7587.18s]  This room which I don't think I'm supposed to be here. No. I need one more of these fucking things.
[7587.18s -> 7599.46s]  It's not this. But is it? All right give me help. Is this the red room elevator? Then it was not
[7599.46s -> 7635.14s]  just up here? Tubes. Okay right so now I'm back up here. There's nothing over here. All right so
[7635.14s -> 7650.54s]  this is back up this way. Where would the other hand arm thing be? Back up through the tubes and
[7650.54s -> 7676.18s]  then it was to the right wasn't it? It was the left. I thought I got spun around. Dude have you
[7676.18s -> 7696.39s]  been exposed to radiation? No dude I'm fine. All right so I did this one. I got that one. I can go
[7696.39s -> 7716.62s]  in this thing now. I can touch this. Right? Yeah. All right let's go. Let's go. I get it. Okay well
[7716.62s -> 7747.32s]  um do it to the one that's blocked. Okay then go that way. I think that's the only one. I gotta go
[7747.32s -> 7776.94s]  that way. Okay. Okay. I got a feeling it's gonna be right here. Remember do you think you have what it
[7776.94s -> 7817.77s]  takes to be America's next top model? Yes. One more. Lock it in. Where's this one go? On here.
[7817.77s -> 7851.11s]  Wait for the click. Thank you. I know a thing or two. Okay so I got everything. It's time to get
[7851.11s -> 7861.58s]  out of here. Time to turn on the red room uh and see what happens. I'm very interested. By the way
[7861.58s -> 7870.25s]  make sure you get hype for the I'm going to dodge your battle act stream. Coming to you very soon.
[7870.25s -> 7884.22s]  Well relatively soon. All right so um I want to go over here right back down to the red room.
[7884.22s -> 7913.80s]  Okay here there's the red room. Back down. All right let's get the heck out of here. Bingo. All
[7913.80s -> 7936.98s]  right what happens? Took me 40 minutes to do this shit. Oh what's that? You have to rev that up.
[7936.98s -> 7966.14s]  Okay hold on. What is this? Interesting. All right turn it on. Um that's not gonna work. Um
[8006.57s -> 8013.66s]  shit. Okay I'll be all right. Stop. It's a puzzle. You don't beat him instantly. Nobody opens this
[8013.74s -> 8019.26s]  game. I'm sorry. Nobody does this. Everyone that's like oh my god. He has his brain.
[8019.26s -> 8029.38s]  Just hold on. You don't open this and go like. No it takes five minutes to do. It takes five
[8029.38s -> 8068.14s]  minutes. See it takes five. It takes a few. That's difficult to do that. You don't just solve it
[8068.14s -> 8072.86s]  instantly. You don't solve a puzzle like that instantly. I don't. Nobody does that. I bet you
[8072.86s -> 8096.07s]  half of you guys took 15 minutes to do that. I still have that thing attached to me. Oh geez.
[8110.78s -> 8125.94s]  Are you gonna get up? I think this person's gonna get up. All right I got some device. What is the
[8125.94s -> 8137.08s]  device for? Does that open doors? All right that opens. Logitech Brio yellow color correction using
[8137.08s -> 8150.89s]  OBS. I don't. Do I have to fix this right now? Hold on. I'm gonna fix this right now apparently.
[8150.89s -> 8196.04s]  Well I'm into it. Let's go. Got it. Got it right. There it is. There it is. I'm good. Let's go. All
[8196.04s -> 8200.12s]  right so this is gonna open doors that have the symbol in the top left which I'm imagining is the
[8200.12s -> 8207.86s]  one upstairs right. The one that I walk by all the time. Let's wait is that up and over or is
[8207.86s -> 8235.72s]  that over here? It's over here right? Right here. Okay. So what's in here? This seems creepy. Come
[8235.72s -> 8261.58s]  on the other side. Don't you think that would add some atmosphere if like after every major kind of
[8261.58s -> 8267.70s]  area and every puzzle was like music played and you just heard it's going. That'd be kind of cool
[8267.70s -> 8319.06s]  I think. Oh okay. I can open that door. What's over here? Weird. All right doesn't have a sword in
[8319.06s -> 8329.72s]  its hand. Okay crazy. All right let's go. You're doing well. I'm just having fun man. What's your
[8329.72s -> 8345.42s]  opinion of garlic and onions? It pretty much makes any food better. That's just a fact. Who is
[8345.42s -> 8349.10s]  disagreeing with that opinion? I feel like that's the safest opinion you could possibly have.
[8351.54s -> 8356.10s]  In fact I don't think there's a safer opinion than saying that garlic is delicious. Garlic and
[8356.10s -> 8367.32s]  onions make things taste good. What a- that's not a thing you'd even disagree with. Oh shit this
[8367.32s -> 8410.01s]  thing's moving. Get it out. Get it off of me. What do I do for it? I fill it with like blood?
[8410.01s -> 8436.50s]  Okay. I'm doing a lot of like internal burping this stream by the way. It's gross. This is
[8436.50s -> 8530.58s]  important. I'm back. All right. Okay I got that whatever that is. Is there a filter on it?
[8530.58s -> 8552.01s]  There shouldn't be. This is really creepy. All right I'm going around here. Oh my fucking god
[8552.01s -> 8557.29s]  give me a break. Are you kidding me? I've ruined everything. Jesus. God damn it. Fuck.
[8575.86s -> 8590.39s]  That's fucking creepy. Come on. I'm actually pissed off right now. I'm truly- I'm not- I'm very
[8590.39s -> 8596.95s]  unhappy. I didn't turn the stupid filter off and I see people saying filter filter. I thought
[8596.95s -> 8654.63s]  you talked about the webcam. Whatever. Let's go. Jesus. All right open the door. Did I beat like
[8654.63s -> 8687.69s]  the first zone here? I haven't seen anything else. All right I don't know. Okay interesting.
[8687.69s -> 8707.69s]  Let's go straight ahead. Okay there's a light right here. Very cool. Jesus. Oh what the fuck?
[8709.05s -> 8754.84s]  Did I get a new power? Oh this is a new power. I can open up doors that have that. Okay so let me
[8754.84s -> 8787.05s]  commit this to memory here. So I have two keys technically I think right. What's down here?
[8787.05s -> 8796.22s]  Blood. Lots of fucking blood. Lots of blood. That's a lot of blood. I have to be better at
[8796.22s -> 8801.53s]  fucking acting. I have to be way better at acting. Oh I need to move this. I need to be a fucking
[8801.53s -> 8818.26s]  better actor. All right so I just walked in a circle. Nothing over there. So I gotta get down
[8818.26s -> 8834.60s]  here. Oh all right I got that. I can probably move this somehow. Was there a door that I walked by?
[8834.60s -> 8865.56s]  Maybe. Oh I couldn't go this way. I'm sorry I can't do it. The problem is I can't see where the
[8865.56s -> 8871.64s]  board is right. So I have to put my arm over here without looking and press the button and it's I
[8871.64s -> 8882.78s]  can't. I need to I need to put this somewhere else and where I can like just I can't fuck this
[8882.78s -> 8891.70s]  up anymore. I gotta stop doing this routine for a few minutes. It would make sense if I wasn't
[8897.90s -> 8907.10s]  Okay I gotta find that button and it's right there. Right there. From here. Right there. Okay I
[8907.10s -> 8931.11s]  got it. Can I actually not go down anywhere from here? Where am I supposed to go? Because this
[8931.11s -> 8943.67s]  just wraps back around. I have a second key. I guess over here I could go. I mean didn't I already
[8943.67s -> 8971.26s]  do this? This is the elevator. I can't go back up. What's the one place I didn't go this way?
[8971.26s -> 9005.10s]  Like over here? Did I not go over here? Oh okay yeah yep yep yep we're good. I have to kill this
[9005.10s -> 9074.15s]  thing. Oh jeez. All right these things are alive. Is it alive? Fucking scary. Uh hello.
[9089.19s -> 9091.03s]  What the hell? Why can I not attack?
[9102.25s -> 9155.38s]  That was. You dead? Geez. Okay so that's that. Why would I do this twice? I wouldn't keep it there.
[9155.38s -> 9163.62s]  So now I go up and I can. Okay so I have to move this one. Does this one have a thing?
[9190.44s -> 9201.45s]  Now I just need to get up there. Elevator right and walk through. I have to actually start fighting
[9201.45s -> 9232.02s]  enemies now. This is gonna be rough. Stop! Stop! Ow! Okay that's so you can kill them pretty
[9232.02s -> 9252.28s]  instantly then. Up here I need to get to that walkway. Which is it right here? Is the walkway
[9252.28s -> 9263.26s]  right here? I don't know. I think so. And I walk this way. Yeah one and then two but wait a second.
[9265.50s -> 9276.73s]  I already got that. Press E to heal. Are you serious? Oh my god you're not a liar. I thought
[9276.73s -> 9311.74s]  you lied. I don't think I. Is it a full heal? This is fucking hurting me. What? This is actually
[9311.74s -> 9354.30s]  hurting me. This thing is still killing me. I'm gonna have to be able to get this thing off right?
[9354.30s -> 9357.26s]  I'm gonna sit in the like a meek grinder machine and this thing's gonna get.
[9357.98s -> 9387.48s]  A blade's gonna go under its back. Okay oh boy. Okay oh no no no don't dark souls me please. Oh
[9387.48s -> 9426.06s]  my god give me a fucking break. Yeah okay get me please get me back the other way. What do we have
[9426.06s -> 9482.70s]  here on the machine? I think about that felt weird. I hated that. In the head. In the head. In the head.
[9482.70s -> 9490.07s]  In the head. In the head. In the head. Directly in the head please. Why is it not grabbing?
[9494.01s -> 9524.09s]  How come I can't grab it? It's fucking. Why can I not hit him in the head? You just got a rare
[9524.09s -> 9537.75s]  animation. Wait I have to do this all over again? Oh god damn it. All right I'm not gonna fuck it
[9537.75s -> 9584.23s]  up. It's not that. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'll be fine. Heal. How do I get out of here?
[9586.01s -> 9654.90s]  I just wanted to leave the globe. Pull this. All right we're good. Dermot your mother's watching
[9654.90s -> 9663.35s]  the streams. Don't waste her time. My mother would probably open the stream and go what is he doing?
[9663.35s -> 9665.27s]  What is this? And she would leave.
[9683.18s -> 9694.02s]  Dude what does the bar on the right side even mean? Oh it's a stamina bar. Okay I thought it
[9694.02s -> 9697.62s]  was a stamina bar but it was hard to even tell where the bar was. All right so you can do it
[9697.62s -> 9730.10s]  twice. Is there a block or anything? Can I pull the thing up? Okay so that's my health bar. Wait
[9730.10s -> 9737.08s]  okay the top row is the amount of heals that I have and the all right so the squares are actual
[9737.08s -> 9764.12s]  health. The thing's much bigger than the other ones. I don't think I can do anything with that
[9764.12s -> 9787.19s]  right now. It's scary. I don't want to get overwhelmed here. This is this is a huge area
[9790.39s -> 9798.20s]  so let's do this slow and do this right. I'm gonna go this way first and I'm gonna go up. Oh I'm gonna
[9798.20s -> 9827.11s]  get so fucking lost here. I'm gonna get so lost. There's gonna be a big ball there. Okay so there's
[9827.11s -> 9843.08s]  gonna be a huge ball that I have to get on that. So that's a good place to start. Okay so let me go
[9844.34s -> 9868.47s]  over there I think. Sure yeah it sounds right. The track here. All right so this is a uh for a
[9868.47s -> 9881.56s]  teleported ball. What's on the other side? Okay one of these. Oh no that I thought that was a machine.
[9881.56s -> 9897.56s]  No it's not. All right there's nothing over here. All right let's go. Who just said what's the point?
[9897.56s -> 9903.46s]  I don't know of why would I why am I playing this because it's uh it's halloween time. What's the
[9903.46s -> 9922.20s]  point? Oh wait a minute it's new it just came out. This was a pretty hyped up game from what I
[9922.20s -> 9935.82s]  remember. Didn't I what we watched the e3 trailer or something right? All right where am I? We did
[9935.82s -> 9965.32s]  I think we did yeah. Is that the thing I needed to grab? Oh please please don't.
[9965.32s -> 10041.26s]  I have this more to do. I think I have to bring it all the way up. Oh health refill. Cool. So this can hold two charges and each charge is four health.
[10041.26s -> 10054.10s]  Totally eight health. All right what else is here? Anything interesting to do still? Anything at all?
[10054.10s -> 10140.46s]  There's probably a few of them. Oh you're dead? Stop I can't move. What's up with your face today?
[10140.46s -> 10190.34s]  I don't know. Oh did I do anything with this or just it's just annoying and in the way? Hey
[10190.34s -> 10220.76s]  why does he only read mean messages? No I've read some nice ones. All right so now bring this all
[10220.76s -> 10243.58s]  the way up and then I can go pick it up. Wow I gotta turn it down. All right so that's all
[10243.58s -> 10266.28s]  the way up there now. Two oh shit. I don't have invincibility when I'm doing that to someone.
[10284.94s -> 10300.84s]  Shoot. We're good. It's all the way up. I think I just need to grab it with the uh the big claw hand
[10300.84s -> 10309.21s]  right? Because I think that's what I have to do. I'm out of I know I have a little bit I've got more.
[10309.21s -> 10339.58s]  I'll get to full health. Snore? Don't even. Don't don't even. Don't even. Don't even start. Don't even.
[10339.58s -> 10360.89s]  Okay now uh do I do now? I guess I can I don't know. I'm gonna activate this. Oh that's giving me an
[10360.89s -> 10383.21s]  area to go. I'm gonna go that way just to see what oh I can't wait just moving on its own.
[10383.21s -> 10395.14s]  This shit's moving on its own. So now I'm imagining I get in and then go down or get in and just run
[10395.14s -> 10430.68s]  across. I think we're gonna are we gonna see the end of this arc here? No. What is the end of that
[10430.68s -> 10443.13s]  arc? I definitely get it ripped off of me right? I have to. Yeah right there. I'm gonna sit in this
[10443.13s -> 10463.64s]  I'm gonna sit in this and it's gonna take it off of me. Watch this. What am I looking at? I don't
[10463.64s -> 10486.34s]  know what I'm I don't know what that does. That's cool. All right this thing's coming off. Ammo. Oh
[10486.34s -> 10509.50s]  I have all right cool. So weird. All right so this thing's loaded. Probably gonna be using it right
[10509.50s -> 10596.55s]  now to shoot something. Yep. Stop. Score. Cool. Now this looks interesting over here. It doesn't do
[10596.55s -> 10613.85s]  it. That's not it? How's that not it? How am I supposed to get that to go? There's not enough
[10613.85s -> 10643.43s]  pieces. There's not enough pieces to do this. I mean do I need another piece or something? I don't
[10643.43s -> 10658.20s]  get it. I had all three of them lit up. All right the only time I can light this one up is if it's
[10658.20s -> 10667.43s]  touching the one on the right side here. That's the only time the middle one lights up. No. So what
[10667.43s -> 10714.31s]  is making it do that? I got it. That was weird. Score. All right this is goes into the elevator
[10714.31s -> 10729.91s]  upstairs. Oh no I gotta do this again. I gotta do that again. It's gonna be harder next time.
[10729.91s -> 10750.54s]  Please. Um okay. I'm going. Let's go down. So I need to put the you know what I'm saying? I gotta
[10750.54s -> 10754.22s]  put the thing in to go down another level or should I just go down with it right now?
[10756.07s -> 10767.46s]  Should I go and put the thing in or should I just go down to that second level?
[10767.46s -> 10786.23s]  Get more ammo? Uh I think this is only one use. Yeah I can't get any more. I'm just gonna try
[10786.23s -> 10796.42s]  going down. How come these aliens build their spaceship with a bunch of annoying puzzles?
[10800.25s -> 10809.59s]  Well think about it. If an alien landed here and you told them to get in a car and go drive on
[10809.59s -> 10816.47s]  go go anywhere on like a highway they'd be like what the fuck is all this? What's this weird system
[10816.47s -> 10823.42s]  of lines that you have to go on with this thing? They'd say the same shit. Our highway systems
[10823.42s -> 10837.14s]  would confuse the fuck out of an alien. So I mean is this the equivalent? Probably. I need that.
[10837.14s -> 10869.46s]  There it is. So what should I put in the middle one? Puzzle complete. Is he okay? Better than
[10869.46s -> 10912.79s]  ever. All right go down. Do that other puzzle right here. Very cool. Very cool. Hey dude you are
[10912.79s -> 10922.20s]  making me angry. Uh oh. How do I get more weapons? Can I do it? I can't. Where's my other gun?
[10923.51s -> 10933.77s]  Uh oh this is bad. Um I don't I can't reload. There's nothing in the gun.
[10933.77s -> 10963.19s]  Do I even need to kill any of this shit honestly? Press one. Oh oh my god okay I was doing mouse
[10963.19s -> 10968.65s]  scroll. I was trying to scroll for new weapons but it's just okay I got it. Cool. Cool. That's
[10968.65s -> 10989.37s]  weird. Is it gonna melt? This is a weird request. Dude can you do Alex Jones stuck in the scorn world?
[10991.58s -> 11011.18s]  How what how somebody is next to me right now. Let me figure this out first because this is
[11011.18s -> 11034.14s]  gonna take me a little bit. All right I can turn this one. Oh fuck the whole thing has to be done.
[11034.14s -> 11134.44s]  No no no no no no. Okay hold on. You gotta just get them all matched up.
[11134.44s -> 11155.21s]  How do I get them to turn together? Oh that's how. All right hold on. I gotta turn this how
[11155.21s -> 11197.72s]  many times? Like two more times? One two three four that. Okay so now oh I'm so goddamn close man.
[11198.36s -> 11238.60s]  So I need to keep this uh yeah. Scorn. Okay cool. Now I go go back put this in and go all the way
[11238.60s -> 11255.10s]  down. This guy's supposed to dodge a battle axe. A puzzle is a video game puzzle is not even close
[11255.10s -> 11267.37s]  to comparing me dodging a battle axe. They're two completely different. Oh whatever. Just run.
[11270.87s -> 11288.74s]  It's basically the same thing. No it's not. It's not even close. Are you gonna practice for the
[11288.74s -> 11300.15s]  battle axe stream? Practice what? Do you think I need practice? I don't I couldn't I don't think
[11300.15s -> 11306.23s]  you know who the fuck you're talking to. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hold on. I'm sorry. That was
[11307.03s -> 11329.37s]  let me let me cool it off a little. Let me cool it off a little. Do you know who I am? Do you have
[11329.37s -> 11334.97s]  any idea who I am? Do you know who you're talking to? You think I can't dodge a battle axe? Oh okay.
[11335.61s -> 11347.58s]  Sorry I'm gonna cool off and I forget where I'm going. I knew I had to go up to go to that device
[11347.58s -> 11363.64s]  to put the third plug in. Um I forget where that is. Oh you have any idea who you're talking to?
[11371.00s -> 11386.74s]  I need where is this machine thing? It's up here somewhere over there. It's across the way right?
[11386.74s -> 11392.39s]  Did I go did I run by it? I mean I'm sorry I'm looking at chat people are telling me to do an
[11392.39s -> 11414.10s]  Alex Jones impression. I'm trying to pay attention to this fucking puzzle game. Okay here this is not
[11414.10s -> 11439.46s]  it. Where is this thing? It's right there. Jesus. How do I get over there? Wait what? How the fuck
[11439.46s -> 11458.66s]  do I get over there? Other way was the oh god you were just there? It's right it's right here. How
[11458.66s -> 11468.47s]  do I get over there? Oh my god I was already over there. All right. All right. No it started. I'm
[11468.47s -> 11482.54s]  not doing Alex Jones ever again. No I'm not doing Alex Jones ever again. In fact yeah you're gonna
[11482.54s -> 11489.99s]  get punished with a Stewie Griffin impression. That's what you get. You're gonna get punished
[11489.99s -> 11545.14s]  with a Stewie Griffin. Here it comes. I say Ryan. What? Then we go down all the way. Most streamers
[11545.14s -> 11558.54s]  don't punish their viewers. I'm I'm punishing you with a Stewie Griffin voice. I think I think it's
[11558.54s -> 11577.90s]  gonna be okay. All right everything has been done. Now I have to grab the ball. What's down here?
[11577.90s -> 11591.35s]  Nothing. I have complete I have uh wait did I explore down here completely? I think I did
[11591.35s -> 11604.68s]  right. Is there anything else to do down here? I mean I could just turn this on. Will this get
[11604.68s -> 11666.82s]  the thing I need? All right we'll get it. Okay so what did that do? Can I get in? Oh now I can grab
[11666.82s -> 11702.09s]  this and take it over here. Uh all right um now what? Uh I think there's another ball to grab here.
[11702.09s -> 11714.38s]  You're doing great. Oh thanks. Funny when he starts doing a bit and you can tell when he gets
[11714.38s -> 11722.81s]  completely distracted from whatever he's doing in the game. Yes that happens very frequently
[11722.81s -> 11731.64s]  because my problem is I don't stop moving right. I don't stop moving. Usually when I start talking
[11731.64s -> 11736.44s]  I look in the chat. I'm just I'm just walking right. Just walking straight and turning corners
[11736.44s -> 11740.76s]  and stuff. So what I disconnect from the game when I'm talking to you but I'm still moving.
[11741.56s -> 11746.15s]  So I need to just take my hands off the keyboard when I start to talk and then oh I'm still in
[11746.15s -> 11765.37s]  the same spot. Okay I can kind of get and plant back in. All right so what does this do? Nothing.
[11765.37s -> 11797.93s]  Okay um should I just go in here? Ball ball ball gg gg there's no ball. What do you mean gg?
[11847.06s -> 11863.35s]  Now I'm gonna go down and then I'm gonna it's gonna grab it out of this hand it off right.
[11863.35s -> 11878.97s]  Can I just hand it off? Can I drop this here? Oh all right nice very nice. So now we got
[11881.93s -> 11899.43s]  two balls over here. Looks good. All right I'm gonna get in this one but not yet. What is the
[11899.43s -> 11918.94s]  point of this one? I guess I could bring it. Where am I gonna bring this? I guess that makes sense
[11919.50s -> 11928.98s]  and then I go in that. All right um let me just check back here because I don't want to miss
[11928.98s -> 11935.34s]  anything. Did I go down here yet? I don't think I did. There's an alien down here of course I didn't.
[11935.34s -> 11970.22s]  Oh this thing's dead. Did I go down here? Did I come down here? Oh I did yeah this is where that
[11970.22s -> 11998.62s]  thing was crawling around over here. All right I'm going back up. I've been down here. I just dodged
[11998.62s -> 12029.03s]  so much. Why am I even fighting you? What are you what are you doing? Get it off. So I'm gonna go
[12029.03s -> 12068.14s]  in that ball. I think that completes this section. Interesting. I need ammo again with this monster.
[12075.38s -> 12089.64s]  Wait that's hurting me every time. Really? Can that thing actually kill you and just
[12089.64s -> 12133.26s]  softlock you in the game? I'm assuming yes. Oh thank god. Oh all right another one of these
[12133.26s -> 12148.98s]  which I probably have to drop all of them. Okay what? Can I not go this way? Okay I can't go that
[12148.98s -> 12185.45s]  way. So what? Okay I've already been here. Shit. All right how do I get down there?
[12186.41s -> 12197.82s]  Can't go that way. Do I have to do something with this? This game reminds me of seafood.
[12202.58s -> 12243.51s]  Weird. Um I'm gonna go this way and down. Whatever. Not even gonna give you a chance.
[12243.51s -> 12285.58s]  Um oh I can't move. Wait should I stay in here? I feel like I'm okay. Okay it doesn't move. These
[12285.58s -> 12289.98s]  guys probably jump off and follow you around. I'm gonna kill them every time I see them.
[12291.85s -> 12329.14s]  Yeah what's that? This is gonna be such a huge pain in the ass I can already tell.
[12329.14s -> 12334.42s]  I gotta move all these. When I move one of these gates another gate closes in a different place
[12334.42s -> 12371.98s]  and then oh shit there's a new enemy. Oh dude it's a new scorn like game. That was a good one. How
[12371.98s -> 12387.94s]  far back am I? Scorn like game. I'm about that far back right? No. No not really at all. All right
[12387.94s -> 12406.52s]  let's keep going. Shut up. I don't want to shoot you but I'm- oh my god the little shit enemy killed
[12406.52s -> 12423.29s]  me. How many takes of this did I do? Scorn. Scorn. Scorn. That one doesn't have any effects on it at
[12423.29s -> 12444.28s]  all. That was just a guy. Scorn. That would probably be annoying after a while. I think I have- no I
[12444.28s -> 12468.10s]  don't. Just kill it. It's not annoying. Yes it is. I know it is. All right now let's get ready.
[12468.10s -> 12478.28s]  This thing falls. Oh look out. Okay we're good. It doesn't go anywhere. This is where the enemy is.
[12478.28s -> 12495.11s]  I got a full clip. Okay turn this on. I need health. Bad. Let me check over here first.
[12495.11s -> 12504.89s]  It's probably health or something right? There's really nothing over here.
[12506.49s -> 12528.23s]  Dude what is that sound? No there's nothing here. Okay let's try this again. Hopefully I don't die
[12528.23s -> 12543.56s]  because I'm going to start over. Very saturated. Yeah. Have you considered reloading? I got a- I
[12543.56s -> 12562.70s]  have a full magazine. All right here we go. Here it comes. All right let's go. All right.
[12568.44s -> 12602.62s]  Shut up. Shut up. I'm fine. Scorn. I have to do that whole thing again. How am I gonna- nice
[12602.62s -> 12617.37s]  indie filter. I need health. I don't have any health potions or anything. If I get hit once I'm
[12617.37s -> 12625.94s]  dead. All right I just have to- I can't run in the hallway. He'll kill me if I run down the hall.
[12635.06s -> 12659.61s]  Go go go go. I know where I'm going. Come on. Just watch this hall. Okay so I'm gonna just
[12659.61s -> 12669.94s]  do this and then run away because I will just- I'm gonna just run him around this circle. He
[12669.94s -> 12701.67s]  has to follow the same pathing rules that I do. There he is. All right. Get out of this tunnel.
[12730.28s -> 12743.54s]  Thought I could stagger him enough times. Don't just run. Don't try to kill it. Really?
[12745.21s -> 12758.73s]  Yeah. Don't be greedy. I was under the impression that if I shot it in the head it moves around and
[12758.73s -> 12771.42s]  I can shoot it like four or five times. It was my mistake. Okay let's try this again. Look I can die
[12771.42s -> 12807.00s]  in one hit anyway. I'm seriously- I'm just rushing now to get through this. Yeah I know. Come on.
[12808.68s -> 12829.05s]  Come on. Yeah whatever. Okay I'm going to just run away. I'm not gonna fight. I'm gonna just run.
[12829.61s -> 12836.47s]  I'm not gonna waste ammo. I'm not gonna waste an entire magazine on this shit. Where is the
[12836.55s -> 12842.39s]  path I need to take? Through here and then I want to just wrap around.
[12845.11s -> 12853.99s]  Pretend every enemy is a battleaxe. Well I'm not actually moving to get out of the way.
[12858.71s -> 12864.30s]  All right. Where am I? How do I get out of here? What's the correct way to go?
[12864.86s -> 12873.78s]  I think I have to go that way. All right let's run you around. Yeah I actually have to go
[12873.78s -> 12887.22s]  where he came from. All right that was much easier than- he's not still behind me right?
[12891.13s -> 13002.71s]  Oh let's do something. Move. I'm gonna get up. Oh thank god. Do I have this? I don't. I need the
[13002.71s -> 13024.70s]  other piece. Where is it? Don't- don't come at me please. Don't just doom three but it's awesome.
[13024.70s -> 13036.30s]  I mean it's really really cool. The atmosphere of the game alone is worth playing I think.
[13036.30s -> 13043.91s]  I don't know honestly much else to say besides that but I mean that's carrying the whole game
[13043.91s -> 13049.59s]  for me right now. This is like how weird and interesting this place is. All right I'm gonna
[13049.59s -> 13064.17s]  die in one hit down there. I'm gonna shoot it. I'm gonna shoot this guy. He hates it. He loves it.
[13065.61s -> 13087.91s]  I have to give my full assessment. Where are you? You're just fucking around. Are you gonna get up
[13087.91s -> 13134.14s]  if I- I mean I die in one hit so okay. This way. Dude if I would have just let you in
[13134.70s -> 13159.94s]  I would have just let this thing in. Oh god. Oh wait oh goodness. Oh thank goodness.
[13160.58s -> 13170.60s]  Okay we're good. Is this health? What is this? Oh it's the key. Is this health? This is ammo.
[13171.54s -> 13182.10s]  I need- oh shit. Can I get more? All right well I guess I'll just fill the whole thing.
[13182.10s -> 13195.53s]  This should be enough for another view at least. That's good. Let me get the key and then I have
[13195.53s -> 13207.22s]  to go back through that. It's gonna be annoying. How do I get back there? This is a disaster.
[13207.94s -> 13263.14s]  I'm just gonna run. Don't go down there. Okay and then it's this way and then I think I'm kind of
[13263.14s -> 13273.85s]  lost. I think it's this way and up to get to that door. He's not gonna follow me all the way over
[13273.85s -> 13294.28s]  here right? I don't- I don't remember. It's up. That's all I remember is up. I think I have to
[13294.36s -> 13301.61s]  plug in this thing. Yeah where are you going? I don't- I'm trying to backtrack back to where
[13301.61s -> 13321.48s]  that door was. I think it's this way. I hope I'm right. Is this wrong? This is too far back.
[13330.41s -> 13343.59s]  That was right. No no no no that is right. Wait what? You scorned too much dude. It is right.
[13343.59s -> 13354.14s]  Is the dev in chat? Is it right? Can the dev tell me what's right? Dude you scorned too much.
[13364.95s -> 13383.88s]  Oh I went too far. Did I go? Help. I actually want help. Backseat me please. It's too far back.
[13386.52s -> 13451.08s]  Okay. Too far back. Phew. Are we doing good? Yes. My scornometer is low. I can help you out
[13451.08s -> 13466.98s]  there in a minute. Oh thank goodness. I'm gonna leave it at that. Full ammo. Pretty much full
[13466.98s -> 13494.81s]  health and on to the next area. Looks like I am gonna heal again. How's the audio? Are we good?
[13494.81s -> 13549.78s]  Are the levels good today? It's this way. Huge guy. Okay huge guy. Check over here. Hey! You know
[13549.78s -> 13569.42s]  what? Oh there's two things over there. Oh my jeff. I've had enough of that bullshit.
[13588.60s -> 13607.14s]  This is really expanding here. This is going a long way. I don't even remember where. I gotta
[13607.14s -> 13654.36s]  go all the way back for stuff maybe? I don't know. Okay. Oh shit. Um okay. This way? I guess. Hey
[13654.36s -> 13657.48s]  Jerma I'm the creator of scorn. Just wanted you to know the easiest way to complete the game.
[13658.04s -> 13771.90s]  All right. Music just changed. What is that thing? Oh my god. I'm not gonna. Am I? No I'm not.
[13772.46s -> 13802.23s]  Who's responsible for this? Yous?
[13811.19s -> 13860.52s]  You're still. Ah! You're gonna stop me from doing this? I'm just going in. Oh all right. I'm in. I
[13860.52s -> 13882.12s]  made it. I made it. I'm good. I'm good. Is that a map? It's like where I. No it's a puzzle. Okay.
[13882.12s -> 13926.25s]  I'm going back up. Ah! I'm fine. Am I going the right way? I don't know. Come here. Come here.
[13926.25s -> 13957.38s]  Come here. Come here. That thing is terrifying. All right. What a weird thing. I hope I'm going
[13957.38s -> 13981.27s]  the right way. Is this right? I don't know. Oh what's that sound? Oh it's one of those things.
[13981.27s -> 14000.10s]  Okay all right. I'm good. Would you ever play this in VR? That would be horrifying. Go that way
[14000.26s -> 14056.34s]  too. Boy. Oh! Health. It has hands. How much health do I have? Let's take one. Okay so now I can
[14057.06s -> 14085.53s]  go down. Oh my goodness. They're everywhere. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.
[14086.09s -> 14106.62s]  Die already. All right. We're good. I need four dots to get in here. This game so looks so cool.
[14106.62s -> 14120.81s]  It really does. It's. All right. I. It's good. It's very good. But I don't know how good.
[14121.99s -> 14142.25s]  Does that make any sense? So now I got to get back down. I think I have to walk just straight
[14142.25s -> 14175.32s]  down right? Down here. Jeez. All right. Now what? Dude. Now what? What am I like turn? Am I turning
[14175.32s -> 14230.18s]  into something? All right. Here comes the puzzle. This is impossible. This is not possible. Oh.
[14260.92s -> 14297.06s]  Um. I mean this is where I came from. Isn't it? I missed the hallway back here. Did I? The puzzle
[14297.06s -> 14323.29s]  room down here in the bottom layer. I mean like here. Um. I didn't go over here. Right. Well I
[14323.29s -> 14337.46s]  can't go that way. Did I go both directions here? I can't go over there. Did I go this way? Yeah. I
[14337.46s -> 14350.06s]  can't go over this way. All right. Um. I don't. I don't get it. If I can't do that maze puzzle.
[14350.06s -> 14376.52s]  I'm gonna. I'm gonna say go down. Hmm. Like down here. I don't have one of those. This is a new
[14376.52s -> 14399.08s]  weapon. What is this? This is like a shotgun. Cool. Oh the middle ones are shotgun. The outer
[14399.08s -> 14407.05s]  ones are pistol. So I must have all the weapons in the game now right? Yeah. I have to. I have
[14407.05s -> 14414.52s]  all the weapons in the game. This is the. I don't want to use this frequently. Although let me
[14414.52s -> 14439.16s]  reload it. Three shots. Good to go. Good to go. Let's go this way. Can't go that way. So let's
[14439.16s -> 14448.58s]  go over here. Well I'm gonna use it because if there's a time to use it it's right now.
[14451.90s -> 14487.80s]  Two shots to kill the big guys. You got it. Okay. Where are you?
[14503.82s -> 14546.36s]  Where are you? I'm moving so slow. Holy shit. I'm moving one mile per hour when I reload.
[14546.36s -> 14580.34s]  You made me cry today. I'm sorry. Whatever. I didn't do anything. What about the time that you
[14580.34s -> 14610.66s]  made me cry today? Jeremy you're stupid. You didn't do the puzzle fast enough. Stupid. Oh yes. So good
[14610.66s -> 14615.37s]  luck trying to remember where the hell all these were. I know where this one is. It's right here.
[14615.37s -> 14630.94s]  It looks like I only got two more bubbles. How close am I to the end of the game? The last third
[14630.94s -> 14648.42s]  or something. Two more bubbles can fit and I have all the weapons. You're close. Two bubbles. I think
[14648.42s -> 14667.72s]  I'm alive. Oh it was a shortcut back. All right. So where were those two? I already got that. Okay
[14667.72s -> 14678.49s]  looking for the door of the bubble doors. Wasn't there a bubble door up here? I feel like there is.
[14678.49s -> 14737.91s]  Right. Where's the bubble door? This way. I'm going in. All right. Can I do this one? No. Oh that's
[14737.91s -> 14744.97s]  the- I gotta get all three of them up there. I get it. All right. So how do I go? I gotta go to the
[14744.97s -> 14751.32s]  other bubble door and come down. All right. I know. I know. I'm going. Here we go. There's another
[14751.32s -> 14767.50s]  bubble door. Where is that bubble door? Is it straight down? It's all the way over here right?
[14767.50s -> 14785.53s]  Is it on this floor? Can you please say bubble door ten times fast? Bubble door. Bubble door.
[14785.53s -> 14791.32s]  Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Hold on. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble
[14791.32s -> 14794.36s]  door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door.
[14794.36s -> 14798.57s]  I can do it a few times. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Bubble
[14798.57s -> 14808.49s]  door. Bubble door. Bubble door. Is it a handful of times? It's not this way. Is it all the way
[14808.49s -> 14844.36s]  up or down? I don't remember. I think it's over here. It's down. Down. Down. Down. Down. Down.
[14844.92s -> 14860.95s]  Far left. Um yeah but I mean I uh far left from where? Like from where I'm standing right now
[14860.95s -> 14875.61s]  this way? Like this way left? Because there's nothing here. I swear to god I saw it. Where?
[14875.61s -> 14889.00s]  I gotta get around there. I have to keep going down. Down. Down. Down. Down. How do I get down
[14889.00s -> 14899.80s]  from here? How do I get down from here? Can I go down from here? I think I can get down here right?
[14899.80s -> 14917.00s]  Can I get there from here? No I can't get there from here. This is all blocked off. Um and there's
[14917.00s -> 14939.54s]  nothing this way. Ceiling? Down around here? It's not this way right? Yeah scream at me if I'm going
[14939.54s -> 14958.84s]  too far the wrong direction because I genuinely don't fucking know where I'm going. Um is it though?
[14959.40s -> 14993.69s]  It is isn't it? Yeah. I wish I had like a fucking compass. All right so from here I have to be down
[14993.69s -> 15009.88s]  you're saying. How do I get all the way down here? Can I go this way? And then backwards? No? And then
[15009.88s -> 15025.93s]  down this way and then around and backwards? Oh there it is okay. Score! I was gonna press it but
[15049.83s -> 15064.97s]  oh okay. Wasn't there a huge guy over here? I distinctly remember a huge guy. Can we see
[15064.97s -> 15087.66s]  the other side? That's like a shortcut back. All right so what do I do now? All right I open that.
[15087.66s -> 15116.66s]  Okay shotgun please. Geez. Candy corn? If candy corn had 30% less flavor I'd like it. All right I
[15116.66s -> 15123.82s]  got health. I'm out of ammo though that's bad. I have zero ammo. I hope I don't have to kill
[15123.82s -> 15139.74s]  anything because that would not work out. Um there's another one of these I can activate back there.
[15139.74s -> 15180.49s]  I wonder which one it is. All right let's open it. Why are you playing this like an E3 demo?
[15186.06s -> 15198.74s]  Uh am I? No I'm not. Why? Is it because of the amount of times I've gone? Okay so okay.
[15202.58s -> 15207.05s]  That's why. It's because the amount of times that I've done something and gone.
[15208.82s -> 15217.96s]  Okay. All right so I think we're going left. What do you want? You want to be quiet? Would
[15217.96s -> 15226.46s]  you want me to not say a word? Fine I'll give you the anti-E3 playthrough.
[15266.74s -> 15284.42s]  This is unfair. Unfair horse shit. That's unfair dog shit. I better not be far away. Please don't
[15284.42s -> 15299.35s]  put me far away. This is not bad. What the fuck? Okay whatever just go. So I have to fight two
[15299.35s -> 15321.35s]  huge things. Okay good to know. Take the shotgun out. It's two dodge two. I could also run. I'm
[15321.35s -> 15329.69s]  gonna run. Is there anything else over here to do? Nope. Go run. I forgot you go one mile per I can't.
[15343.38s -> 15354.36s]  Ah go go go go go up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up
[15354.36s -> 15395.85s]  hurry hurry go go go go go. I'm good. Another super hard section. Did I miss? Oh my god.
[15395.85s -> 15400.47s]  Are you still alive?
[15441.08s -> 15451.27s]  All right time to go complete this. Good luck remembering how they get how to get back there.
[15451.91s -> 15481.59s]  Can you just help me? Wait what from here? Where do I go? All right I got it. Thank you.
[15481.59s -> 15492.46s]  So now the machine is over here. Right yes. All right it's time. It's time to be time to complete
[15492.46s -> 15517.24s]  a puzzle. Go out that way. All right let's go. How does this work? I I don't I don't understand
[15517.24s -> 15540.34s]  what's happening. Oh I do understand what's happening. All right. Okay wait I need to get
[15540.34s -> 15548.18s]  it up. Okay where do I have to get it? It's got to be up the top. How do I get it up there?
[15601.05s -> 15612.09s]  How do I get it up in the two slots above where I need to go? You know what I mean? I I can't move.
[15612.09s -> 15618.70s]  I there's nowhere for me to put the ball. Even up there I wouldn't be able to connect it.
[15624.14s -> 15629.78s]  So the ball is staying in the same place but it's three different mazes. But the issue is
[15629.78s -> 15636.39s]  how do I get the ball up to the top when there's no way to move it to get it into those two slots
[15636.39s -> 15668.49s]  at the top? How do I get it up? I don't get how I get it up there. Oh I see. I see one. I see. How
[15668.49s -> 15745.59s]  do I get it up there? Yay. I can't let go of this. Um where do I go from here? What happened? What
[15745.59s -> 15800.41s]  the hell happened? Oh the okay that was weird because look it was it was blocking me on. Wait
[15800.41s -> 15807.66s]  that was really weird. Okay I thought I couldn't go up here. I had a lot of collision on that. I
[15807.66s -> 15812.65s]  didn't I actually didn't think I could cross over it. No no like I'm serious. I got stuck. I thought
[15812.65s -> 15818.57s]  this was like I thought the I thought this was blocking the path because I got stuck on it.
[15818.57s -> 15826.92s]  You saw I got stuck. Like yeah see I was like oh shit I can't go up here. There's collision on
[15826.92s -> 15880.55s]  some of that stuff. Weird. What happened? Nothing's still alive. Oh I got like ripped. Jesus.
[15884.94s -> 15891.70s]  I won't do that ever again I promise. I'm done with that. You're not going to hear that for the
[15891.70s -> 15937.43s]  rest of the day. I've almost completely turned into whatever I'm turning into. Am I controlling
[15937.43s -> 16023.37s]  it? No. Where even are we? I got out of my system. I'm gonna clear these because I don't want to do
[16023.37s -> 16075.82s]  them again. What's going on over here? This area is cool. Very interesting stuff. Very interested.
[16075.82s -> 16138.23s]  So up I guess. What is in here? All right that wasn't easy. All right I'm done. I get it now. I
[16138.23s -> 16147.94s]  know what you mean. What is in here? Go in and fucking find out. Why you oh what is in here?
[16149.22s -> 16152.66s]  Go in and find out. Like why would I ask that like rhetorically out loud?
[16153.53s -> 16162.39s]  That is that is E3 demo talk. I get you. I understand now. Wrapping around this corner
[16162.39s -> 16212.46s]  right? I know what you mean. It fills air. Interesting. Okay so this is all right so an alien
[16212.46s -> 16221.62s]  species landed on earth and started to like assimilate people. I mean this is like oh look
[16221.62s -> 16249.42s]  we're this right this looks kind of like old god type of stuff. Jesus. I guess they've grown
[16249.42s -> 16275.69s]  under their heads. Alien tech yeah. What's the point of doing that? Oh yeah um just like open up
[16275.69s -> 16280.33s]  their rib cage and like peel their skin back and just peel it and just staple it. But what why?
[16280.33s -> 16300.78s]  But what? What's this for? It's just unnecessary. Well that's weird. I can go down. I can go this
[16300.78s -> 16316.14s]  way too. Looks like there's a lot of places to go. Um let me go up first here. But this is
[16316.14s -> 16359.72s]  different. What's this? Babies? Okay we're gonna go this way. No we're not. We're gonna go the other
[16359.72s -> 16425.90s]  way. I'm talking. It's a gel. Okay is it I don't know like I don't get it. You just stole Austin
[16425.90s -> 16445.10s]  Powers mojo. So what do I do with that? I guess I'm gonna wait is there another place to go? No.
[16452.95s -> 16459.88s]  Do you want to play the Austin Powers theme song? Would that be good? Would that be fun?
[16461.99s -> 16478.79s]  I can't take this back. I don't want to play the Austin Powers theme song because I feel like it
[16478.79s -> 16489.91s]  would ruin the rest of the game and we're getting to like the big climax. Look at those faces in
[16489.91s -> 16517.45s]  here. Oh I should have done that. I shouldn't have done that. I should not have done that.
[16517.45s -> 16535.62s]  I don't I shouldn't have done that. Did he get up? I don't think he gets up. Not yet at least.
[16535.62s -> 16556.79s]  Plenty of health. Nice. All right good. Very good very good very good.
[16556.79s -> 16579.80s]  Ammo. Fill it up. Looks good. I'm gonna load the guns all up. That one's all good. This one is all
[16579.80s -> 16612.60s]  good. All right um so I imagine I take this one too. Will they fight each other? Excuse me. I don't
[16612.60s -> 16638.68s]  get it but whatever. I take this fucking thing. Do you fit in here? No. I don't know where to take
[16638.68s -> 16821.54s]  this. I can't weigh this down. What do I do with this body? I don't want to keep holding this. This
[16821.54s -> 16837.14s]  is fucking weird. This is gross. I don't want to keep holding this. Um where do I put it? If I run
[16837.14s -> 16878.79s]  this way what do I do with this? Jesus. Okay it's a full thing of uh of juice. Wait. Uh oh. So I put
[16878.79s -> 16885.75s]  this back on here and I filled this. So this person's- I'm gonna ruin this whole thing if I do

[16932.57s -> 16949.11s]  It didn't do anything. We need two of them. You need two. So I gotta get the other one or whatever
[16949.11s -> 16958.09s]  okay. This one's gonna get up and I have to fight it. Can I go back this way? It's blocked off right?
[16958.09s -> 16991.62s]  Mm-hmm. Yep. I'm in. This time it's gonna get up and fight. Yeah there's no doubt in my mind. Time
[16991.62s -> 17028.97s]  to fight it. Why am I- why am I- I'm like a tree. All right I gotta shoot the sides right? Are those

[17207.16s -> 17215.83s]  direct by two free grenades in a fucking row. Are you kidding me? He led me and lock and loaded me.
[17215.83s -> 17256.23s]  What do I do? What? Oh shoot him in the- I don't know what's going on. What do I get that? I don't

[17464.82s -> 17497.51s]  even back here? Oh this one. How do I get over there? Good luck. Oh look at my health. That's bad.
[17526.22s -> 17582.73s]  There's a claw. How do I get that to move? I don't know. I actually don't know. Kapow. Kapow. Kapow.
[17582.73s -> 17646.25s]  Shoot it? That didn't work. What? Did I shoot this? Holy shit. Okay. Do I have to fight this again?
[17646.25s -> 17655.88s]  I hope not. Do not. Dude no. I have to fight another one of these. I have to fight it again.
[17657.32s -> 17662.97s]  You've got to be fucking kidding me. I don't want to fight this thing again. I have no health. I'm
[17662.97s -> 17679.45s]  gonna lose. Dude this sucks. I don't want to fight this thing. Shit can I- what if I explode it?
[17680.09s -> 17698.68s]  When it goes down for gas I'm gonna shoot this. Going down for gas. Oh my god I just did it.
[17698.68s -> 17721.93s]  What did I just do? Are you dead? What did I- did I just do it? Cool. All right. All right I got it.
[17721.93s -> 17748.73s]  What is even going on? I have way more questions than the beginning of the game.
[17751.59s -> 17800.52s]  What's happening here? Um I can't use any other weapon. I can't take this off. All right well
[17800.52s -> 17811.82s]  we got both of them filled up here. Wait is it saying I can't pick this up because my hands
[17811.82s -> 17853.29s]  are covered in weird tree shit? Are you serious? I can't do this. Um how do I get this off? Okay.
[17853.29s -> 17884.71s]  What's this? That scream. It's like a Tom and Jerry sound. Excuse me where's the health?
[17886.33s -> 17990.92s]  Score. Reload. I think you're actually soft-locked. What? No I'm not. I bet you I jump in that suit
[17990.92s -> 18007.70s]  and I get healed. Yeah I just gotta get the thing, run to that suit, and jump right in it.
[18007.70s -> 18076.60s]  All right I can't do this. So I have to go over here and then down. What's this? Okay.
[18089.67s -> 18101.78s]  Wait should I just get in this now? I can't. All right so what about over here? This looks like a
[18101.86s -> 18125.48s]  track or an elevator. I have this key. Oh come on. No. Oh yes. I was gonna say can I not interact
[18125.48s -> 18158.84s]  with it? Right I can't do this. Okay so now rip it off. Get in the suit. What else is over here?
[18158.84s -> 18197.94s]  This is a five bubble door. I don't have a five bubble key. Am I seeing this right? What's going
[18197.94s -> 18221.27s]  on? What is happening? Don't look. Score. I'm not pressing it again. All right so let's get this
[18221.27s -> 18264.15s]  thing ripped off. Okay and let's go. That's just it. That's just ammo. That's ammo for the gun.
[18264.15s -> 18286.60s]  All right um what's going on? Did you just come back? Shit um okay. Really? Okay I'm gonna get
[18286.60s -> 18310.22s]  the thing ripped off. I'm gonna open this door. Okay what does that do for me? What is happening?
[18310.22s -> 18353.88s]  Ah should I shoot this? Oh fuck. Okay hold on. What? Why am I? Dude are you all right?
[18353.88s -> 18383.67s]  Uh dude are you cool? What's he doing? Hello? Score. I got scorned. It was poisonous. What do
[18383.67s -> 18395.35s]  I do here? Should I just reset the game? All right I'm gonna quit. Now go to main menu right? Back to
[18395.35s -> 18446.23s]  main menu and then continue the game. But don't do that again. Okay so now this is I have to go get
[18446.23s -> 18453.93s]  bit by that thing again. Pick up the ammo. Let me heal. How much health do I have? Let's heal.
[18453.93s -> 18489.42s]  All right so get bit. Pick up the thing. Grab the key. Pick it up. All right good. Nice.

[18587.24s -> 18598.18s]  get bit and run back and do this? Am I gonna have enough time? Run run run. Maybe I might just have
[18598.18s -> 18627.83s]  just barely enough time. Okay I'm gonna try it. Okay here we go. Thanks for lying. Thanks for the

[19464.60s -> 19474.78s]  Shit. Well the grand alien plan is ruined. We can't move. We can't go anywhere. Why
[19474.78s -> 19528.68s]  won't this open? What's the problem? All right you stay here. I'm gonna go investigate.
[19528.68s -> 19565.91s]  No? No am I crazy? I look like I made it a plastic. Oh here it is. Are we aliens or are we
[19565.91s -> 19667.80s]  what are we? Are we aliens? Uh watch out behind you. These should both have it right? Sorry.
[19667.80s -> 19706.97s]  There can only be one. Am I missing something? The way this camera angle looks like a piano is
[19706.97s -> 19737.50s]  gonna fall on this guy. Any second now. Um can I move this or something? I'm missing. Eyes, fire,
[19737.50s -> 19777.26s]  go right to the goal. Eyes, fire, hoof to the goal. Should I just? Should I go? I'm biting my lip like
[19777.26s -> 19788.39s]  crazy. Should I just go this way and like explore over here? Can I even walk over here? Can I like
[19788.39s -> 19810.60s]  stop this from happening? Wait what am I doing? All right they both need one of these. All right
[19810.60s -> 19882.50s]  they both need one of. I don't put his hand on it. Do I just put can I place the body down here?
[19882.50s -> 19955.67s]  I feel like that's what I have to do. Do we weigh more? Oh shit what's happening? I can't move.
[19955.67s -> 20013.94s]  I can't turn. All I can do is walk straight. Wait what? This this for this thing again? What?
[20022.31s -> 20031.82s]  Hey thanks for fucking standing there the whole time. Thanks for standing there. Really?
[20032.30s -> 20065.34s]  Did I not wait did I not make it? Is that what we're implying here that I didn't make it to the end?
[20077.91s -> 20156.63s]  Wait what? We're 10 feet away from whatever we were doing? That's it? Score. I was really hoping it
[20156.63s -> 20170.26s]  was gonna say then it was gonna be on screen. Okay um that was weird so it's oh you're trying to
[20170.26s -> 20180.12s]  continue whatever civilization or something but they were these mutated monsters that are stopping
[20180.12s -> 20185.99s]  us and I get right to the end and I almost get through whatever the birth canal or something and
[20185.99s -> 20191.88s]  then the thing stops me and eats me and consumes me we didn't end up actually doing it. I got there
[20191.88s -> 20220.18s]  but I didn't make it. I'll just I'll just watch a baddie video about press continue. Okay can I
[20220.74s -> 20231.62s]  I'm curious hold on a second can I walk through with this one or do you have to walk through
[20231.62s -> 20246.18s]  with this one? No okay that's the only way all right. Why do I keep stabbing him? What's with
[20246.18s -> 20261.46s]  the keep stabbing stab stab? I don't get it why do I have to keep stabbing this? I think this is
[20261.46s -> 20275.96s]  bugged up. There's no definitive answer for anything. I mean that was crazy that was okay
[20275.96s -> 20289.38s]  that last 20 minutes was that was insane. I'll watch a couple videos on it. That was that was
[20289.38s -> 20298.66s]  good that was cool. I like that. I very much enjoyed that. And then that's a perfect time to
[20298.66s -> 20306.42s]  end the stream too. All right so listen to me this is important. We've got a lot going on this weekend
[20306.42s -> 20315.26s]  on Thursday. Thursday I'm going to be playing Gotham Knights sponsored. Are you ready for this?
[20315.26s -> 20319.18s]  Friday I'm going to be playing Gotham Knights sponsored. Saturday I'm going to be playing
[20319.18s -> 20327.58s]  Gotham Knights sponsored three days in a row. But here's the thing. I'm not just going to play
[20328.14s -> 20340.20s]  Gotham Knights. We're going to do another Omega gaming weekend. It's an it's an Omega sponsor
[20340.20s -> 20349.02s]  it really is. It's like free. It's like let's go you know what I mean? Like sometimes you just
[20349.02s -> 20357.91s]  say fuck it let's go. So the Gotham Knights portion of each one of those streams on Thursday,
[20357.91s -> 20363.59s]  Friday and Saturday are only going to be for a couple hours. Then for the remaining three four
[20363.59s -> 20369.02s]  five plus hours whatever we're going to do something else. So keep this in mind I am
[20369.02s -> 20375.99s]  contractually obligated to stream three days in a row. Some of it's going to be Gotham Knights.
[20375.99s -> 20382.95s]  So I have to be here. I am not going to say to you guys oh you know it's like I just streamed
[20382.95s -> 20391.14s]  on Thursday. See you on Sunday. No I'm contractually obligated to be here. So we're going to play
[20391.14s -> 20396.17s]  Gotham Knights for a few days in a row. But we're also going to do a bunch of other shit too.
[20396.17s -> 20404.10s]  I want to play horror games this weekend. I want to play the puppet combo games the new ones that
[20404.10s -> 20412.41s]  came out. I want to play Breath of the Wild this weekend. Yeah Gotham Knights looks like it could
[20412.41s -> 20424.46s]  be really fun. I don't know very much about it. I know it's um it's a game set in uh Arkham. That's
[20424.46s -> 20433.83s]  not not Arkham. I meant to say Gotham. It's a game set in no Gotham is the city. Arkham is not the
[20433.91s -> 20441.75s]  city. Gotham is the city. I don't know why I thought it was Arkham. That's my bad. What a fake fan.
[20441.75s -> 20447.51s]  No I just screwed up. I was trying to say that the city Gotham it takes place in Gotham not Arkham.
[20459.13s -> 20468.52s]  Anyways we're going to play Gotham Knights for three days and a bunch of other shit. I'm actually
[20468.52s -> 20475.74s]  pretty excited. So I'll see you on Thursday where we're not going to start with uh with Gotham
[20475.74s -> 20484.02s]  Knights. Gotham Knights will appear for like a couple hours right in the middle of all these
[20484.02s -> 20492.42s]  streams. It's going to be super variety. We are going to be changing games every two or three hours
[20492.42s -> 20498.28s]  and I'm going to wear the Nightwing shirt. You better look at your ass. I'm gonna like why am
[20498.28s -> 20504.50s]  I such a frog today? Well that's going to be the end of this stream. I gotta why am I so froggy
[20504.50s -> 20512.47s]  today? Listen to this. I'll see you guys on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday starting around
[20512.47s -> 20526.12s]  uh four o'clock pacific. Gotham Knights, Breath of the Wild, Puppet Combo, and some other shit.
[20526.20s -> 20535.38s]  We'll see. Scoring was cool. That was a lot of fun. I the first 10 minutes I was like oh shit this is
[20535.38s -> 20539.61s]  a puzzle game. But there's enough interesting stuff happening and I think a lot of the weird
[20539.61s -> 20545.58s]  horror elements were enough to really keep you going. I think it's good. I thought it was fun.
[20547.40s -> 20559.56s]  It was it was definitely an experience. I'd say that. But yeah I'll see you guys on Thursday
[20559.56s -> 20565.08s]  or uh well is it Omega gaming weekend or is it just Thursday, Friday, and then one day on Saturday?
[20565.08s -> 20581.82s]  It's good to be back. Omega sponsor weekend. And I like you know it's kind of interesting though.
[20581.82s -> 20589.74s]  I will have a hard date for you guys for the Battleaxe stream within the next couple of weeks.
[20589.74s -> 20606.17s]  This is happening really soon. What's the Battleaxe stream? I'm gonna dodge a Battleaxe
[20606.17s -> 20614.50s]  in real life. That's it. Is the stream is that stream gonna be 10 minutes? It's gonna be as
[20614.50s -> 20629.43s]  long as I want it to be. So I'll be don't don't worry. Oh all right I'll talk to you guys soon.
