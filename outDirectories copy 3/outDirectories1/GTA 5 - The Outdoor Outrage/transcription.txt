[0.31s -> 14.82s]  I just get so tired on these long road trips. Man, I need a coffee or something.
[14.82s -> 20.82s]  What's with all these people with their lights? Learn how to fucking drive. I mean, seriously.
[20.82s -> 27.41s]  Look, downtown cab company. Will you leave me alone? Like, can I just like block downtown cab company?
[27.41s -> 31.41s]  Because they just, well, we got a random event. Robbery. Robbery in progress.
[31.41s -> 38.80s]  Can I seriously just say, I kill the person getting robbed in these random events more often than not.
[38.80s -> 40.80s]  Like, this happens all the time.
[61.94s -> 67.94s]  To clarify, that was a joke about a bus driver installing off-road capabilities to his school bus.
[67.94s -> 72.94s]  And delivering some unruly children to their school in a very unorthodox fashion.
[73.94s -> 76.20s]  Back to the show.
[76.20s -> 80.89s]  See, I don't know why mummy doesn't want me to play in the street. It's fun. Look.
[81.89s -> 87.90s]  So here's a challenge for you guys that have GTA V and are looking for something difficult to do.
[87.90s -> 93.90s]  Hop on a dirt bike like this, get on the highest mountain, and drive down in cinematic mode.
[93.90s -> 98.90s]  If you can make it to the bottom, you won. Because it's like impossible.
[99.90s -> 103.48s]  Oh, is that like two seconds?
[111.61s -> 114.61s]  This reminds me of those commercials. Like, everybody knows those commercials.
[114.61s -> 117.61s]  But like the truck that's sitting on the mountain for no reason.
[117.61s -> 122.78s]  How do they get the truck up there? Like, well, how did I get the truck up here is the real question.
[122.78s -> 124.78s]  I drove it. But they don't drive it up the mountain.
[124.78s -> 129.78s]  They bring a crane and they drop the truck on the mountain with the crane and like a helicopter or something.
[130.78s -> 132.78s]  I don't know how they do it. OK, I have no idea.
[132.78s -> 135.78s]  And they might drive it up the fucking mountain, but I really don't know that.
[135.78s -> 138.78s]  So let's test my hypothesis right now. Let's drive down the mountain.
[138.78s -> 146.78s]  Let's take our new Ford Tundra 2013 and take it down the goddamn mountain like they would expect you to do if you had one of these cars.
[146.78s -> 149.78s]  And another thing, let's talk about advertising in general.
[149.78s -> 154.78s]  I'm getting sick and tired of these advertisers. Holy shit.
[154.78s -> 163.61s]  OK, so we made it. Sorry, Ford.
[163.61s -> 168.78s]  I apologize because you can see this like works. Sorry.
[168.78s -> 174.74s]  Honey, this is just an absolutely breathtaking view of San Andreas.
[174.74s -> 177.74s]  Oh, it's so beautiful. I can't wait to send this to my cat.
