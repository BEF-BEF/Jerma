[22.97s -> 38.54s]  I don't know that was fucked up. I was having problems. My internet's fine. Must be maintenance.
[41.46s -> 54.20s]  This is Dread X. We're just gonna play Dread X because Steam still doesn't fucking work.
[55.18s -> 68.63s]  An hour and 20 minutes later. So we're gonna just do Dread X. Having fun. Finally, finally.
[68.63s -> 83.70s]  I still can't get it to download a game. Try the Steam stuff tomorrow. Is it gonna be will it be
[83.70s -> 92.98s]  live tomorrow? Okay, we have till the 20th. Alright. Hey guys, welcome to the stream. Uh,
[92.98s -> 97.38s]  pretend the last one didn't happen. I didn't stream today. I'm very late. It's five o'clock.
[97.38s -> 105.77s]  I'm just starting right now. Very. I'm starting right now. Dread X. This is a bunch of horror
[105.77s -> 112.33s]  games. It's gonna be scary. So I'm gonna suggest you. I don't care. Let's go. I'm gonna start with
[113.29s -> 125.64s]  Car Thank. Oh, okay. I was like, what happened? This is the first one. This is Dread X collection
[125.64s -> 156.33s]  one. Here we go. How's the volume? Good. Car Thank. Press enter to continue. What the fuck is
[156.33s -> 162.49s]  happening? I fucking hate computers. Your mission is to investigate the ruins of the ancient
[163.54s -> 173.67s]  Dalvik Kate civilization. But something about things there. Explore the temple and reassemble
[173.67s -> 183.58s]  the mummy. Is that the map? I ain't gonna be able to do this. This map is fucking crazy.
[186.04s -> 198.63s]  Turn your lights off. It's it's light out right now. Doesn't matter. Actually. Yeah, I do. That's
[198.63s -> 217.24s]  a good idea. I can see better. And I look I look a little bit more orange. Why did that make it
[217.24s -> 239.99s]  worse? Okay. Explore and reassemble the mummy. This looks weird. It looks like I'm being interviewed.
[239.99s -> 279.53s]  And I don't want my identity to be known. This is not gonna work. Okay, so we take it. Okay,
[279.53s -> 297.11s]  got a picture. Can I save it or something? What the hell was that? I already did this joke.
[300.54s -> 310.74s]  You're like a 16 year old streaming in his dark room. Oh my fucking god. There. Now it's a little
[310.74s -> 345.34s]  it's creepy, right? Okay, so what am I to explore and put the mummy together? Nice ring light. Yeah,
[345.34s -> 381.46s]  I know. It's fucking annoying. Anything there? Turn around nerd. Let me turn around. It's kind
[381.46s -> 386.81s]  of okay playing a dark scary game during the daytime is impossible unless you put curtains
[386.81s -> 391.77s]  up across your entire house. I can't like that's like glare on my fucking screen. I can't even see
[391.77s -> 416.44s]  what's going on. All right, I gotta put the mummy was with the mummy was the thing I took a picture
[416.44s -> 428.89s]  of before. I mean, this looks like a place where a mummy goes, right? What do I do with this?
[442.30s -> 469.32s]  Open it. How space click block the window with a piece of cardboard. Hold on. Fucking maintenance.
[475.96s -> 490.54s]  Fucking goddamn maintenance. I need to recalibrate the camera.
[490.54s -> 510.70s]  Fucking maintenance. He's a vampire. No, that just like hurt my head. Okay, how we look now?
[510.70s -> 517.27s]  Hey, that's better. It's a little creepier. Streaming didn't even start yet. Just relax.
[517.27s -> 520.71s]  All right. I'm putting on my headphones. You know that how it's going to get real now.
[520.71s -> 552.74s]  Can I open doors? You're walking in circles, bro. What else do we want? What do we want me to go?
[553.38s -> 578.87s]  The directions I have are put the mummy back together with the mummy. Do you like Dr. Pepper?
[578.87s -> 634.52s]  Yeah. How many games are in this collection? Like 15. All right, this one's cool. Am I missing
[634.52s -> 645.62s]  something? What does this mean? Something is like getting lost in the ticket line at Disney World
[645.62s -> 659.05s]  and complaining that the park sucks. All right, but if you got out of the line eventually,
[659.05s -> 663.13s]  and an attendant was there saying, thanks for coming. And you're like, wait, was the ride?
[664.26s -> 681.43s]  If that was the ride, then do I can I interact? I want to see this to the end. I want to see this
[681.43s -> 684.78s]  to the end. This guy, I got to be able to do something, right? Like look at all these
[684.78s -> 715.67s]  fucking symbols. Pick up the light. All right. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I
[715.67s -> 741.91s]  get it. I get it. I just put a light to place up and find something interesting to look at.
[750.41s -> 768.23s]  He doesn't get it. Neither do you. Neither do you. So that's fine. We can share. We can share it.
[768.23s -> 775.08s]  You don't get it either. You don't get it either. What is it? You don't get it either.
[775.08s -> 791.21s]  Do I have like a task menu or something? It just said put them, assemble them up,
[791.21s -> 816.94s]  explore and assemble the mummy. Where's the mummy? Can I go in these doors? I don't get it.
[828.06s -> 836.25s]  The light has a symbol on the back. Where? That thing was missing. This thing's moving,
[836.25s -> 846.62s]  by the way. This thing is moving. Get a picture of that. What the hell is that?
[846.62s -> 865.82s]  There's somebody's arm or body or something. Okay. So that's there. I got a picture of it.
[866.54s -> 885.61s]  I want to see what that is. Get a picture of that. What is that? I have to go use the portal?
[904.25s -> 917.61s]  Aim it at the mirror? Where is there a mirror? What have you decided is a mirror here?
[917.61s -> 958.63s]  This is the hub world. This is a fucking hub world? What the fuck is that? Stop pretending.
[958.63s -> 962.79s]  Guys, the only information was explore and put the mummy together. It didn't say go point your
[962.79s -> 987.46s]  camera into a fucking mirror. All right, relax. This is a dinner serving tray. This is not a mirror.
[987.46s -> 1050.89s]  I can go down there. This is not a roblox game. This is a game journalist. No, I am not. That
[1050.89s -> 1063.03s]  was unclear. I swear to God. How did he die? The monster must have got him in that scary game. No,
[1063.03s -> 1068.07s]  now he broke both of his legs jumping off a fucking small platform and now he's dead.
[1068.07s -> 1152.42s]  Can I make this jump? I can. All right, where's my prize? Can I open that? How do I open this?
[1152.42s -> 1176.06s]  There's definitely a mummy piece in here, right? Okay. Is there any indicator where that is?
[1176.62s -> 1196.81s]  God damn it. Put the fucking camera down. It was at the beginning of the room.
[1199.74s -> 1224.55s]  Was it really? God damn it. It really was. I got to take a picture of it.
[1238.17s -> 1269.66s]  Okay. Yeah, we're getting to major F. I don't understand. It's just like I don't know why
[1269.66s -> 1277.82s]  this happens randomly every few months. I just can't stream to Twitch. Twitch just doesn't want
[1277.82s -> 1317.14s]  me to stream to it. My internet is perfectly fine. Hold on. Hold on. Yeah, I don't know why
[1317.14s -> 1324.20s]  this happens sometimes. Sometimes my streaming to Twitch's servers, it just fucks up for two
[1324.20s -> 1330.17s]  straight weeks. Because think about it, right? Every stream during the Elden Ring streams,
[1330.17s -> 1335.05s]  this has happened for a little while. Then it went away for two months. I don't get it.
[1335.05s -> 1340.26s]  Fucking maintenance. Should I just never stream on a Tuesday?
[1341.77s -> 1349.74s]  Why is it always Tuesday? I'm just literally never turning my stream on ever again on a Tuesday.
[1349.74s -> 1365.22s]  Let me, I'm checking something. Hold on. I'm never turning a stream on on a Tuesday
[1365.22s -> 1382.33s]  ever again. It's the goddamn maintenance day for every company on earth.
[1382.33s -> 1395.83s]  All right. Let me, I'm going to run a test here. I don't know what I get. I just, we just have to
[1395.83s -> 1401.53s]  deal with it, I guess. That's so annoying. I hate when this happens. You know why this sucks the
[1401.53s -> 1409.59s]  most? Because I'm like, I'm very busy and I'm trying to get like streams in like a few times
[1409.59s -> 1415.78s]  a week during like all the busy shit. And I'm just being like, the tap is being turned off.
[1415.78s -> 1429.59s]  I can't even stream today. Am I even still alive? I'm going to be angry now. I'm just going to be
[1429.59s -> 1441.82s]  upset about everything. All right. So I, I just did a speed test right now during when I was just
[1441.82s -> 1451.51s]  dropping frames here. I was at a thousand, a thousand. I don't know. Whatever. I don't get it.
[1451.51s -> 1457.19s]  Let's just keep playing. This, I'm sorry. We have to deal with this, but it's unfortunate.
[1457.19s -> 1462.63s]  Fuck. You know what sucks the most? And you didn't hear anything else. I went off on a,
[1462.63s -> 1466.94s]  well, good. I went off on a rant. Whatever. All right. Let's just, let's just play.
[1467.66s -> 1483.37s]  I'm really thrown. I'm really thrown off today. Really thrown off today. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[1484.17s -> 1494.36s]  I had the picture taken. I just, Oh my. I'm fucking thrown off now. Give me a break.
[1495.42s -> 1532.12s]  I have to fucking be pissed in a minute. I'm so thrown off right now. All my juices are all
[1532.12s -> 1551.34s]  fucked up. So mad. At least the scream is funny. You know, okay. It's like, okay. I'm going to
[1551.34s -> 1561.56s]  settle down because I'm fucking pissed right now. I am pissed off. One, two, three. Okay.
[1562.12s -> 1565.32s]  Let's just, just as chill. Let's take a second. I can take a sip.
[1571.43s -> 1574.79s]  The music makes it seem like I'm such much more of a unhinged person.
[1575.59s -> 1578.79s]  I'm going to mute the audio cause like the audio is making me fucking mad.
[1586.58s -> 1625.67s]  I can't shake it. I can't shake it. God, dude. I can't shake it. I can't shake it. All right.
[1625.67s -> 1638.12s]  Was it, was it? Okay. Person. I don't know. Camera. I don't know. Camera TV. I don't know.
[1638.12s -> 1655.08s]  I don't know. What is this? Okay. Let's go. Person. No, put the camera down. All right.
[1655.08s -> 1668.31s]  Somebody, Ahmad helped me. Thank you. Of course for that person. You know, you got man,
[1669.03s -> 1675.26s]  camera TV. See, they say nobody gets this. They say that's my favorite part about that whole
[1675.26s -> 1680.71s]  interview. They say, they say nobody, nobody can get this. Nobody gets this. Nobody could get that.
[1681.67s -> 1690.73s]  I think nobody, nobody can do this. All right. What is it? I can't even do it.
[1701.80s -> 1711.37s]  Huh? What's the last symbol? Hey, what's the last symbol? What's the last symbol?
[1711.37s -> 1717.32s]  There's only three symbols there in that mod chat. What's the last symbol? Oh, the box opened. Oh,
[1717.32s -> 1748.10s]  cool. Oh, I got a piece of the mummy. What's up with the internet? Nothing. The last time this
[1748.10s -> 1764.98s]  happened, I ran a speed test. Oh my God. It's the mummy. Am I still alive? What happened?
[1766.42s -> 1775.46s]  Was I not supposed to die? Jesus. That was actually kind of terrifying.
[1778.20s -> 1783.27s]  I think it's a Twitch problem. The last time I did this, I ran a speed test overnight
[1783.27s -> 1788.55s]  and I was cleanly at almost a thousand, one thousand up and down for an entire evening.
[1789.19s -> 1794.33s]  This is fucking Tuesday maintenance. Can we rename this stream Tuesday maintenance?
[1795.05s -> 1804.20s]  Fuck maintenance or something. I don't know what to say. That was crazy. I think I lost.
[1805.56s -> 1812.52s]  Should I go back? There's a lot to see. I need to settle down. I am settled down.
[1815.69s -> 1851.40s]  What are you doing? I just died. That was unfair. I wasn't fair to that one.
[1853.19s -> 1861.03s]  Last time I was dealing with Tuesday maintenance. What's this one? Don't go out? Shatter? Hand of
[1861.03s -> 1881.69s]  doom. I think I want to try this one. Let's do hand of doom. Am I orange today? Because all the
[1881.69s -> 1905.99s]  blood is flowing to my face. Hand of doom. Okay. How does this one work? What did figure?
[1910.41s -> 1929.38s]  Okay. It's a book of dread incantations. Sure looks to be useful.
[1929.38s -> 1962.02s]  It didn't work. Okay. Oh, unlock doors. I got it. Okay.
[1972.79s -> 1978.12s]  Failed? What do you mean? That's right there. Open it. A locked door. I just opened it with a spell.
[1979.32s -> 2006.30s]  What is it? Talethistort. Nice. Enter the dark dungeon. Hedge wizard.
[2006.70s -> 2013.24s]  You must be the newest resident of the dungeon. How did you escape from the dungeon?
[2015.24s -> 2025.14s]  You may have been better off staying locked up. Okay. Can I throw a fireball at him or something?
[2031.93s -> 2042.25s]  Is this the same person? Wait. That book. Could it be? It's the Lost Grimoire. The master searches
[2042.25s -> 2049.91s]  for it. They say it grants the wielder great power. Pray the master does not learn you possess it.
[2052.58s -> 2052.98s]  Okay.
[2073.42s -> 2080.55s]  I know that one. Step aside. Fucking amateur. One spell Andy coming through.
[2080.55s -> 2082.86s]  And all it is is unlock a door.
[2082.86s -> 2117.38s]  Nice. Let's go. What was that? Oath of Flame.
[2119.03s -> 2124.10s]  Ethistalort.
[2135.19s -> 2152.07s]  Okay. There's a torch. Oh shit. Can I pick that up? Ethistalort.
[2159.83s -> 2170.92s]  Which way should I go?
[2205.45s -> 2206.97s]  Stop doing that. Why is it blowing out?
[2212.18s -> 2235.51s]  Oh, that's okay. All right. I got light. Where is there no light this way? All right.
[2235.51s -> 2247.18s]  Ethistalort. Is it going to speed up my voice? Stop wasting your mana on starlight.
[2247.74s -> 2249.82s]  Holy shit. Let me tell you something about starlight, by the way.
[2255.53s -> 2262.89s]  Hold on. Dude, I tried coke starlight. Coke starlight is unbelievable. It's like the
[2262.89s -> 2273.27s]  greatest soda I've ever had in my whole life. A knife with dark sorcery. You feel compelled to
[2273.27s -> 2290.44s]  take it. Coke starlight is so good. It's just regular coke. No, it's not. Coke starlight,
[2291.56s -> 2296.92s]  it tastes kind of like cotton candy with vanilla coke in it. I don't know. It's very interesting.
[2299.22s -> 2302.26s]  Of all the dumb gimmick flavors I've ever come up with, I think it's really good.
[2303.06s -> 2308.30s]  What the fuck? Ethistalort.
[2308.94s -> 2329.88s]  This is lasting a lot less than... Oh, I have a knife. So what should I do now? Should I stab
[2329.88s -> 2339.83s]  somebody? What the fuck just happened? What did I just do that for? Why did I just do that?
[2347.14s -> 2352.74s]  Just stabbed myself in the hand. Okay, does somebody... Do I have to kill that monster
[2352.74s -> 2371.58s]  that's in here? Or should I just leave? Because this is hand. Just leave? Okay.
[2388.58s -> 2396.97s]  All right, so I got the knife. Enter the graveyard.
[2409.58s -> 2410.94s]  Blood fountain? Okay.
[2424.15s -> 2431.26s]  Okay, so that's health. I get it. So there's a demo. Wait, we got demos working. Steam works
[2431.26s -> 2437.67s]  like two fucking hours later. Streaming on a goddamn Tuesday ever again. All right, so
[2440.60s -> 2444.52s]  yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna do it though. I'd rather try to do that again tomorrow if the
[2445.32s -> 2477.43s]  server shit is better for Orts. Yeah, this is just annoying. I got an idea. I got an idea.
[2481.75s -> 2485.51s]  We are at almost 10% of all frames being dropped, which that's... Fuck, that's awful.
[2488.33s -> 2496.09s]  I'm gonna... Here's what I'm gonna do. This is the plan. I am going to try again later today.
[2497.24s -> 2509.02s]  Try to come back tonight. Because this is very obviously not fixing itself. And I really don't...
[2509.02s -> 2514.86s]  Streams where you drop 10% of all frames, they just... It's just... Especially for VODs and...
[2515.82s -> 2523.66s]  I'll try later. The whole vibe of the stream gets all fucked up. And it's just like, all right,
[2523.66s -> 2530.98s]  the internet sucks. Well, not the internet, but whatever the connection is here. I'll try. Let
[2530.98s -> 2539.62s]  me try later tonight. I'll be back. Download some demos. I'll get some... We'll try some demos
[2539.62s -> 2550.86s]  tonight. Because I have to imagine that maybe later it'll be okay. Let me try coming back in
[2550.86s -> 2563.45s]  like an hour or so. Maybe like an hour or two. So sorry, guys. This frustrates me. Trust me,
[2563.45s -> 2571.74s]  this frustrates me as much as it frustrates you. And then some. But... And I'd rather just do it
[2571.74s -> 2579.58s]  when it works. But we'll try it again. These games, I want to... Let's get back to this.
[2580.22s -> 2584.14s]  I was very frustrated during that last game. And not the game's fault is the fucking goddamn
[2584.14s -> 2590.68s]  Tuesday. Here, it's already doing it again. Not the game's fault. I was already upset. That game
[2590.68s -> 2601.56s]  has seemed pretty fun. I want to make sure that I make that clear. It frustrates me more. Yeah,
[2602.28s -> 2606.92s]  I'll be back. Let me try this again. I'll see you guys a little bit later. Sorry. We'll try again
[2606.92s -> 2610.68s]  in a couple hours. Probably like eight o'clock Pacific. If we can't get it to work then, then I
[2610.68s -> 2616.66s]  don't know what to say. I'll try again tomorrow. So I'm going to turn the stream off and I'm going
[2616.66s -> 2622.63s]  to scream into a pillow. I'm going to hold it up and just go... So yeah, it's pretty fun.
[2626.07s -> 2642.71s]  Do four orbs before you leave. All right, yeah. That doesn't do anything. Smash. Smash. All right,
[2642.71s -> 2647.78s]  I'll try again later. I'll be back. We're not even going to do an outro. I'll see you in an hour or
[2647.78s -> 2651.70s]  two. Goodbye. See you later. Good night. If you're leaving, if we see you again tonight,
[2651.70s -> 2659.59s]  then hi. How are you? Good to see you. My name is me. I'll be back. Goodbye. See you later today.
[2660.23s -> 2666.44s]  All right, now I'm going to pretend to click the off button and go like, fuck,
[2666.44s -> 2675.62s]  fuck, like I did earlier, right? All right, goodbye. I'll see you in a minute.
[2675.62s -> 2678.18s]  A lot of minutes in a row. Goodbye.
