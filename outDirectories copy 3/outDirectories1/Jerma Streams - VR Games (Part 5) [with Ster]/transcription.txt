[20.02s -> 24.39s]  You weren't supposed to be able to see me yet. I'm not supposed to be on here.
[24.39s -> 38.22s]  But hi. He thinks he's live. Don't turn it off.
[38.22s -> 43.53s]  No, I'm fucking out of here. Just like listening to like the bibidibid bibidibid bib.
[43.53s -> 76.15s]  Right back. Okay. That means your mic is hot now.
[79.16s -> 85.82s]  Okay. My first time. Hey everybody, welcome to the stream.
[86.46s -> 89.61s]  You know me. Look at your wrist to view your watch.
[89.61s -> 91.93s]  Don't listen to that lady. She's going to say that over and over again.
[94.20s -> 97.37s]  You can hear me, right? Oh yeah.
[98.49s -> 105.66s]  Good. Today we're going to play some fun co-op VR games. Me and my friend Ster here.
[105.66s -> 109.18s]  Look at your wrist to view your watch. Some of you might have heard of them once.
[110.44s -> 115.64s]  Very fun games. We picked the most exciting VR games that have ever been made.
[116.84s -> 119.88s]  Last week we played, what was it? Lethal League Blitz? Last week.
[121.24s -> 123.40s]  Actually that was only like three days ago.
[123.64s -> 125.88s]  Something like that. I got the wrong hands on.
[127.00s -> 132.07s]  So yeah, we don't know how to do any of this. We've been sitting here for a little while.
[134.31s -> 137.51s]  You say VR stream, but you mean like tech stream.
[138.23s -> 141.51s]  We've never played, I've never done any VR multiplayer.
[141.51s -> 144.15s]  And it was just like, let's do it. And we both sat down for a while.
[144.15s -> 145.75s]  We were like, we picked out some games to do.
[146.63s -> 150.15s]  And then we sat down to actually try to do that. We have no idea what to do.
[150.63s -> 154.71s]  So, so far I'm pretty good at buying VR games.
[154.71s -> 157.51s]  Yeah. I'm really good at like purchasing games on steam at this point.
[157.51s -> 159.19s]  Look at your wrist to view your watch.
[159.19s -> 160.07s]  That one will.
[160.07s -> 161.19s]  All right. Are you, are you going in?
[162.30s -> 164.22s]  I'm, I'm in the tutorial room.
[164.22s -> 166.46s]  Yeah, me too. But are you like going in? Are you in?
[167.42s -> 168.38s]  Oh, I'm in.
[168.38s -> 171.50s]  Okay. Just I need, I need you to, I need clarification that you're in.
[171.50s -> 173.74s]  So I can go in too. So then we can, I could be in here.
[174.62s -> 178.95s]  Look at your wrist to view your watch.
[178.95s -> 181.59s]  My balls are dangling right now. You're going to have to tell me.
[181.67s -> 182.79s]  I'm in. Get in.
[184.92s -> 186.28s]  All right. That's all I needed to hear, man.
[190.22s -> 191.74s]  This thing's, oh, this is too tight.
[191.74s -> 193.66s]  Look at your wrist to view your watch.
[193.66s -> 195.10s]  Wait, technical difficulties.
[196.82s -> 199.64s]  Okay. It's too big. All right.
[201.93s -> 202.41s]  Are you in?
[203.21s -> 205.05s]  I'm in. Oh, I'm in.
[205.05s -> 207.21s]  I think I just pulled out all the hair in the front of my head.
[208.25s -> 210.84s]  Look at your wrist to view your watch.
[210.84s -> 212.76s]  I'm going to look at my wrist. Just relax.
[214.78s -> 216.70s]  Are you seriously not looking at your wrist right now?
[216.70s -> 217.74s]  Hold on. Look.
[217.74s -> 218.54s]  I thought you were in.
[219.66s -> 220.30s]  I'm in now.
[221.78s -> 223.62s]  Okay. There you guys are. Hi, guys.
[224.34s -> 225.99s]  Look at your wrist. I did.
[225.99s -> 227.19s]  All right. Here's my wrist.
[227.19s -> 228.63s]  Let's get you into a game.
[228.63s -> 229.59s]  All right. Let's get into a game.
[229.59s -> 231.11s]  Press the play button on your watch.
[231.11s -> 233.43s]  Plus the fucking headphones just came out.
[233.43s -> 234.95s]  I'm stuffing these in as deep as I can.
[235.99s -> 237.53s]  I don't even know if this is the right one.
[241.06s -> 246.49s]  I did buy like the VR, like fucking cocking glue
[246.49s -> 248.57s]  that you just stuff it in your ear and it's a headphone.
[249.45s -> 252.15s]  And you need to get like a goddamn surgeon to get it out.
[255.35s -> 257.99s]  All right. How do I join your video game?
[257.99s -> 258.47s]  Go to play.
[260.44s -> 261.64s]  Look at your watch.
[261.64s -> 265.64s]  All right. There's paintball, paddle ball, paintball, crimson cauldron,
[266.84s -> 268.44s]  laser tag, golden trophy.
[271.08s -> 272.97s]  How do I like be your friend?
[274.25s -> 275.29s]  Look at your watch.
[275.29s -> 276.89s]  I am in my watch. Where are you?
[276.89s -> 278.49s]  You look at your watch and it says people.
[278.49s -> 280.09s]  And I imagine you're people.
[280.09s -> 280.59s]  People?
[281.45s -> 283.69s]  Oh, it's like forcing us to press the play button.
[284.71s -> 286.23s]  What do you see? People.
[286.87s -> 287.43s]  Right below.
[290.17s -> 291.21s]  Okay. Hold on.
[293.77s -> 294.81s]  Go back to the home menu.
[297.03s -> 298.87s]  And it's making me pick paddle ball.
[298.87s -> 300.15s]  It's making me pick paddle ball too.
[300.15s -> 301.99s]  Is this like putting us in the game together?
[301.99s -> 303.37s]  Let's pick paddle ball.
[303.37s -> 304.57s]  All right. Just pick paddle ball.
[304.57s -> 305.21s]  It's going to be easily.
[305.21s -> 308.65s]  We're the only people queuing a rec room paddle ball tutorial mode right now.
[309.93s -> 311.45s]  You'll be matched with another player.
[311.45s -> 312.81s]  It's you. We didn't have to...
[312.81s -> 313.93s]  Hey, look over here.
[313.93s -> 315.69s]  To go through the glowing door to practice.
[315.69s -> 317.69s]  Is it your name is pasty octopus?
[317.69s -> 318.97s]  And you're coming through twice.
[320.09s -> 320.57s]  Nice.
[320.57s -> 321.61s]  How do I delete that?
[321.61s -> 323.21s]  And when you're ready, one last...
[326.09s -> 326.59s]  Voices.
[327.77s -> 328.97s]  Does voices turn that off?
[329.93s -> 330.97s]  My microphone.
[330.97s -> 333.59s]  Turn your microphone off in the settings.
[336.41s -> 336.91s]  Where?
[339.35s -> 341.91s]  Open up your fucking like Aqua Teen watch.
[342.79s -> 343.99s]  I'm in the watch.
[343.99s -> 344.95s]  Why can I still hear you?
[345.91s -> 347.11s]  Where do I turn it off?
[347.11s -> 348.39s]  Go into your watch.
[348.39s -> 350.63s]  Go to settings and then turn up my microphone.
[350.63s -> 351.13s]  Turn off.
[351.83s -> 355.83s]  That's off.
[355.83s -> 357.11s]  Why are you huge?
[358.60s -> 359.80s]  This is how tall I am.
[359.80s -> 361.40s]  You're not like six, eight.
[362.04s -> 364.60s]  What? It maps the VR to where your head is.
[364.60s -> 366.12s]  No, no, that's ridiculous.
[366.12s -> 366.76s]  Give me a high five.
[366.76s -> 367.72s]  That was a good one right there, man.
[369.40s -> 369.88s]  Oh, yeah.
[371.08s -> 372.36s]  He's fucking huge, man.
[374.20s -> 375.88s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[375.88s -> 377.24s]  Why would you do that?
[378.04s -> 379.88s]  What? I just wanted to play rock, paper, scissors.
[379.88s -> 380.38s]  You ready?
[381.24s -> 382.68s]  What the fuck is wrong with them?
[382.68s -> 384.20s]  We only have five minutes.
[384.84s -> 386.04s]  Rock, paper, scissors.
[386.60s -> 387.40s]  How do you do the thumb?
[390.33s -> 391.05s]  How do you do the thumb?
[393.64s -> 394.14s]  Whoa.
[395.00s -> 395.56s]  What?
[395.56s -> 396.52s]  I just teleported.
[396.52s -> 397.16s]  How do you do the thumb?
[397.80s -> 398.44s]  How do you do the thumb?
[401.21s -> 402.57s]  It's different on Vive controllers.
[402.57s -> 402.97s]  I don't know.
[405.94s -> 409.38s]  Why do you have like a better VR system than me?
[410.95s -> 412.15s]  No, I'm just taller.
[414.34s -> 414.98s]  That's bullshit.
[415.62s -> 416.50s]  I know what's going on here.
[416.50s -> 418.26s]  This is exactly what's fucking happening.
[418.26s -> 422.02s]  You have your Oculus, by the way.
[422.02s -> 423.70s]  Oculus is like the platform
[423.70s -> 424.26s]  you shouldn't be on.
[424.26s -> 425.54s]  You should be on the HTC Vive
[425.54s -> 426.50s]  just in case you were wondering.
[427.06s -> 428.34s]  You have, wait.
[428.34s -> 430.10s]  Press the start button on the scoreboard to plan.
[430.10s -> 430.82s]  Are you just sad?
[432.42s -> 434.26s]  It gives you random faces.
[434.26s -> 436.18s]  Oh, I thought you were like crying or something.
[437.62s -> 439.62s]  Your character is just doing like a constant
[439.62s -> 442.26s]  I'm talking, listen to me, I'm important.
[443.06s -> 445.16s]  Wait, can I get down here to your size?
[445.72s -> 446.44s]  No, that's bullshit.
[446.44s -> 449.64s]  You have your two lighthouses on huge like cranes.
[451.00s -> 453.24s]  I'm honestly sitting on the ground.
[454.12s -> 457.32s]  Yeah, it's because I have my setup correct
[457.32s -> 458.60s]  and your setup is fucked up.
[459.16s -> 460.28s]  You're not this tall.
[460.28s -> 462.20s]  You're not like 10 feet tall.
[462.20s -> 462.84s]  Give me a hug.
[463.56s -> 465.00s]  You're like Andre the giant.
[465.72s -> 466.44s]  All right, let's go.
[467.24s -> 469.56s]  Majestic squirrel versus hasty octopus.
[471.32s -> 472.04s]  Which one's you?
[472.76s -> 474.20s]  I'm majestic squirrel.
[474.20s -> 476.28s]  Dude, you are so big.
[476.28s -> 478.44s]  This is not, I can't do it like this.
[479.16s -> 481.72s]  Can you move your lighthouses down like five feet?
[482.28s -> 482.92s]  How do you play?
[485.72s -> 486.20s]  What?
[486.20s -> 487.88s]  Why did that just pop up?
[487.88s -> 489.16s]  How do I like turn this off?
[489.88s -> 490.60s]  I don't, what?
[491.16s -> 493.40s]  Hey, just again, one of my mods is playing TF2
[493.40s -> 494.20s]  in case you were curious.
[495.00s -> 495.80s]  All right, so we got-
[495.80s -> 498.20s]  Oh, I think I got, I don't know the rules.
[498.20s -> 500.44s]  It's just, it's like a just big, it's small tennis.
[501.32s -> 502.20s]  Small tennis.
[502.20s -> 502.70s]  Yeah.
[503.48s -> 506.39s]  I can't get over how fucking huge you are.
[506.39s -> 506.87s]  That's not.
[507.91s -> 509.75s]  All right, I wouldn't, why is there no sound?
[512.87s -> 513.75s]  It's coming over here.
[514.47s -> 518.39s]  I need like a bit more audio.
[518.39s -> 519.27s]  It's like just music.
[520.89s -> 522.54s]  All right.
[523.10s -> 526.74s]  All right.
[526.74s -> 527.30s]  How do I turn?
[528.76s -> 529.56s]  I don't have sound.
[529.56s -> 530.84s]  That's just music.
[530.84s -> 531.56s]  What the fuck?
[531.56s -> 535.14s]  See, it's, did you just score off me right now?
[535.14s -> 536.34s]  I don't know.
[540.41s -> 540.57s]  Wait.
[543.30s -> 544.82s]  Jolly green giant over here.
[544.82s -> 545.54s]  Oh my God.
[553.80s -> 555.16s]  This game, hold on.
[555.16s -> 555.64s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[555.64s -> 556.36s]  How do I turn it off?
[556.36s -> 557.56s]  How do I make the sounds better?
[558.87s -> 560.79s]  Just, can you just wait until we can get out of the tutorial?
[561.91s -> 562.55s]  Oh, sure.
[562.55s -> 564.23s]  So we can just play Jeopardy for God's sake.
[564.39s -> 569.99s]  I'm going to hit this as hard as I fucking can.
[569.99s -> 570.79s]  I hope you're ready for that.
[571.59s -> 572.79s]  Can I like grab it first?
[573.91s -> 576.07s]  Where am I in my room?
[576.63s -> 577.99s]  Am I near like a wall?
[578.71s -> 582.49s]  Which wall is back here?
[586.52s -> 587.00s]  You're okay?
[587.00s -> 587.32s]  All right.
[588.28s -> 588.84s]  Let's go.
[599.77s -> 600.41s]  Match point.
[601.50s -> 602.70s]  This is too hard.
[602.70s -> 603.74s]  I hit that.
[603.74s -> 604.86s]  It's too hard.
[608.10s -> 608.34s]  All right.
[608.34s -> 610.10s]  Can we thank congratulations?
[610.10s -> 612.18s]  We did it.
[612.18s -> 613.78s]  I got a present.
[613.78s -> 614.34s]  What is it?
[615.06s -> 615.38s]  Open.
[616.58s -> 618.74s]  I need to level up some more to use this item.
[618.74s -> 620.42s]  You got an exclamation point.
[620.42s -> 620.82s]  Good for you.
[621.54s -> 626.17s]  I get another one?
[626.17s -> 627.21s]  That's pretty satisfying.
[627.21s -> 628.41s]  That's kind of satisfying.
[629.05s -> 630.34s]  50 tokens.
[630.90s -> 633.00s]  What did you get?
[633.56s -> 635.00s]  I got 50 tokens.
[638.71s -> 639.11s]  I can't.
[639.11s -> 640.39s]  How do I do thumbs up?
[643.86s -> 645.70s]  Violet, why are you dressed like an opera singer?
[646.58s -> 646.82s]  What?
[647.54s -> 650.22s]  You got a tank top on.
[650.22s -> 650.70s]  Yeah, I do.
[650.70s -> 651.10s]  Do it alone.
[652.58s -> 653.22s]  Yeah, I do.
[655.11s -> 655.75s]  How do I leave?
[657.40s -> 659.96s]  I think we're stuck here opening boxes for another hour.
[659.96s -> 660.36s]  Are we?
[661.16s -> 662.28s]  There's a door right there.
[662.84s -> 663.83s]  Should we leave?
[664.55s -> 666.33s]  Oh, you have walking on.
[666.33s -> 667.05s]  You're advanced.
[668.15s -> 669.19s]  Yeah, I'm going to throw up.
[669.19s -> 671.75s]  By the way, this makes me throw up.
[683.86s -> 684.66s]  Stock button.
[684.66s -> 685.70s]  No, I don't want to do that again.
[687.14s -> 688.26s]  Does our watch have a thing?
[690.58s -> 691.14s]  No, there we go.
[691.70s -> 694.71s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[694.71s -> 695.51s]  Okay, challenges.
[695.51s -> 696.79s]  It wants us to do a challenge now.
[697.51s -> 699.40s]  But what about this room?
[701.82s -> 702.54s]  This is a store?
[703.83s -> 704.79s]  Wait, let me turn this.
[704.79s -> 706.39s]  I need to have the music down.
[706.39s -> 707.51s]  The sounds are going to go up.
[710.78s -> 711.26s]  What happened?
[711.26s -> 712.22s]  What are you doing?
[712.22s -> 713.90s]  I sent you a friend request.
[713.90s -> 715.02s]  You sent me a package.
[716.23s -> 718.82s]  Oh, that's my package.
[718.82s -> 721.94s]  That's my box because I completed the challenge to make friends with you.
[723.26s -> 724.30s]  No one else could do it.
[724.94s -> 732.20s]  But look, I got another one.
[732.20s -> 735.96s]  Complete one game in paddle ball daily.
[735.96s -> 737.96s]  Will you stop spraying the coins on me?
[739.56s -> 741.00s]  All right.
[741.00s -> 741.64s]  Who gives a shit?
[741.64s -> 743.64s]  Press the start button on the scoreboard to play.
[746.50s -> 747.62s]  Let's go.
[747.62s -> 748.18s]  Okay, play.
[749.06s -> 749.94s]  All right, all right, all right.
[749.94s -> 751.14s]  Can we pick some of the same thing?
[752.34s -> 753.86s]  Let's put it like bowling or something.
[757.05s -> 758.41s]  This is just Roblox.
[759.53s -> 759.77s]  Yeah.
[759.77s -> 761.45s]  Did you accept my friend request?
[761.45s -> 761.93s]  I don't know.
[761.93s -> 762.25s]  Did I?
[763.18s -> 763.50s]  People?
[764.22s -> 767.18s]  I have a message from you.
[767.18s -> 768.14s]  Let's open it.
[768.14s -> 769.10s]  That's from me.
[769.10s -> 770.62s]  I accept your friend request.
[770.62s -> 771.10s]  Yes.
[771.10s -> 771.34s]  Okay.
[771.34s -> 772.06s]  We're friends now.
[773.10s -> 773.34s]  So.
[773.34s -> 773.66s]  Yay.
[773.66s -> 778.87s]  All right.
[778.87s -> 779.19s]  Play.
[779.91s -> 782.36s]  We're always going to jump into one of these.
[783.00s -> 784.20s]  How about the streets?
[785.00s -> 785.88s]  Okay.
[785.88s -> 787.40s]  I just clicked on something called the streets.
[787.40s -> 788.12s]  I don't know what this is.
[788.84s -> 789.40s]  You're gone.
[790.44s -> 791.40s]  Click on the streets.
[792.82s -> 794.18s]  It's like the second page.
[794.18s -> 794.50s]  Okay.
[794.50s -> 798.60s]  Why is this all screwed up?
[798.60s -> 799.32s]  No shit.
[800.12s -> 805.98s]  This is like a fucking PVP room.
[807.00s -> 810.90s]  We're going to be throwing up on the streets.
[810.90s -> 812.23s]  How do I?
[813.19s -> 815.11s]  See, look at how fucking huge you are.
[815.11s -> 816.31s]  You are way too big.
[817.03s -> 818.39s]  Everybody else is normal.
[820.65s -> 822.25s]  This person can hear me talking, right?
[823.26s -> 824.22s]  Did you mute your mic?
[825.02s -> 827.02s]  I'm like, why am I spying on what she's writing?
[827.82s -> 828.78s]  That was so odd.
[828.78s -> 829.02s]  Okay.
[829.02s -> 830.14s]  I have a new notification.
[830.14s -> 830.30s]  What?
[834.10s -> 834.98s]  Are we kicking me out?
[840.23s -> 841.75s]  Everybody has boxes and shit.
[841.75s -> 841.99s]  All right.
[841.99s -> 844.07s]  Let's just go to the PVP area.
[847.26s -> 848.62s]  I don't know what this does.
[849.26s -> 850.22s]  I'm going out.
[850.22s -> 850.70s]  You coming?
[851.66s -> 852.30s]  I'm out.
[855.27s -> 855.51s]  What?
[855.51s -> 857.11s]  There's people shooting lasers at me.
[857.75s -> 862.25s]  I got to kill them.
[862.25s -> 862.65s]  I got them.
[863.62s -> 864.98s]  We killed each other.
[864.98s -> 865.54s]  I'm alive.
[867.86s -> 869.70s]  Power weapon refreshed.
[869.70s -> 870.58s]  This is Roblox.
[872.02s -> 873.38s]  That guy has a sword and a shield.
[880.47s -> 881.83s]  I like handball better.
[883.19s -> 888.76s]  That's what gamers are being so violent.
[888.76s -> 890.20s]  Oh, I just heard a scream.
[891.16s -> 896.06s]  So I got killed.
[898.47s -> 899.43s]  Where are the weapons?
[904.06s -> 906.22s]  This is a water fountain?
[914.26s -> 917.22s]  I think that kid might actually be running around in his house.
[920.20s -> 921.16s]  This is a big house.
[921.16s -> 921.32s]  All right.
[921.32s -> 921.64s]  Good guy.
[921.64s -> 922.36s]  Come in.
[922.36s -> 922.84s]  Come in here.
[924.79s -> 925.27s]  Walk in.
[925.27s -> 925.83s]  Unlock door.
[931.13s -> 932.49s]  I'm absolutely lost.
[939.00s -> 939.80s]  Should I not have done that?
[940.52s -> 941.40s]  Hey, come into the door.
[941.40s -> 942.28s]  There's a door over here.
[943.08s -> 944.58s]  Do you see the door in the building?
[945.54s -> 946.90s]  There's the buildings everywhere.
[946.90s -> 947.06s]  I know.
[947.06s -> 948.42s]  But there's a locked door.
[949.38s -> 951.46s]  I can't even communicate because you're in the head.
[956.55s -> 957.35s]  I always die.
[959.13s -> 959.61s]  Come on.
[960.97s -> 962.17s]  Am I a prisoner right now?
[966.89s -> 968.73s]  I've somehow become a prisoner in here.
[968.73s -> 969.37s]  You have to help me.
[970.68s -> 972.84s]  They're absolutely ruthless in here.
[972.84s -> 974.04s]  What color is the house?
[974.04s -> 975.40s]  It's blue on the inside.
[975.40s -> 976.52s]  I don't know what it looks like on the outside.
[979.59s -> 981.11s]  They're fucking torturing me in here.
[983.03s -> 983.43s]  Come in.
[983.43s -> 983.83s]  Get in here.
[987.50s -> 988.30s]  Don't be a threat.
[988.94s -> 994.25s]  Is that you opening the door?
[994.25s -> 997.53s]  Yeah, I don't own this PlayStation right now.
[997.53s -> 998.33s]  It's my friend's.
[998.33s -> 1000.01s]  But I'm playing on a VR.
[1000.01s -> 1005.74s]  So they haven't even turned around to look.
[1008.78s -> 1010.30s]  At what point is he going to turn around and be like,
[1010.30s -> 1011.10s]  what are you doing, man?
[1012.98s -> 1018.20s]  I need to hold on a second.
[1018.20s -> 1022.84s]  Whoa, what?
[1022.84s -> 1024.36s]  Hey, he saw me go off my watch.
[1025.16s -> 1027.48s]  He saw me go off my watch and he fucking shot me.
[1028.36s -> 1031.08s]  I was going to try to communicate.
[1032.86s -> 1033.74s]  New notification.
[1038.22s -> 1038.78s]  Where are you?
[1040.04s -> 1042.04s]  I just got to the blue house.
[1042.04s -> 1042.44s]  No, no, no.
[1042.44s -> 1043.88s]  It's called Tony's Gun Store.
[1043.88s -> 1044.60s]  Tony's Gun Store.
[1044.60s -> 1045.40s]  He went to the wrong place.
[1048.78s -> 1050.54s]  Tony's going to Tony's Gun Store.
[1052.71s -> 1053.83s]  How have I not been hit?
[1059.80s -> 1061.24s]  Are you at Tony's Gun Shop yet?
[1062.04s -> 1063.80s]  I'm stuck inside the blue house.
[1064.52s -> 1068.33s]  I think I hit like four.
[1068.33s -> 1070.33s]  All right, I'm turning voice chat on for a second here.
[1071.29s -> 1087.70s]  Hey, let me in, let me in, let me in, man.
[1087.70s -> 1088.90s]  Let me in, let me in.
[1093.94s -> 1095.38s]  Hey, let me in, man, let me in.
[1095.38s -> 1096.90s]  There's wild people here shooting at me, man.
[1096.90s -> 1097.62s]  Let me in.
[1097.62s -> 1098.74s]  Oh, thank God I made it in.
[1099.70s -> 1100.82s]  People out there shooting at us.
[1110.17s -> 1115.51s]  What the heck?
[1117.67s -> 1120.23s]  I don't want to, I'm just, I'm going to, I'm a prisoner.
[1123.67s -> 1124.39s]  I'm a prisoner.
[1124.39s -> 1125.67s]  I don't, I'm not going to do anything.
[1125.67s -> 1126.63s]  I can't shoot you.
[1126.63s -> 1127.43s]  I'm not going to do anything.
[1127.43s -> 1129.43s]  I'm not going to do anything.
[1130.23s -> 1130.79s]  What happened?
[1136.36s -> 1140.17s]  Oh, shit.
[1140.17s -> 1140.57s]  Jesus.
[1146.89s -> 1151.96s]  I'm just going to hang out behind the houses and throw up in the grass.
[1159.99s -> 1160.39s]  Okay.
[1162.23s -> 1164.23s]  Don't, no, no, no, no, don't do it.
[1164.23s -> 1172.89s]  All right, can we do something else?
[1173.69s -> 1174.49s]  Please.
[1174.49s -> 1175.53s]  I'm waiting for you.
[1175.53s -> 1176.49s]  Can we do something else?
[1177.21s -> 1178.41s]  This is your show.
[1179.21s -> 1181.05s]  This is your show.
[1181.05s -> 1182.09s]  All right, let's go.
[1182.09s -> 1182.73s]  Get out of here.
[1183.45s -> 1184.17s]  Go to play.
[1185.85s -> 1191.30s]  And, uh, can we, how do we, let's go bowling.
[1191.30s -> 1191.94s]  I see bowling.
[1191.94s -> 1192.66s]  Let's play bowling.
[1192.66s -> 1192.98s]  You and me.
[1192.98s -> 1193.86s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1193.86s -> 1195.62s]  Can we like, you want to get out of here?
[1195.62s -> 1196.42s]  A friend group?
[1197.38s -> 1198.26s]  Do, can we?
[1204.15s -> 1205.27s]  Ready to start.
[1205.27s -> 1206.23s]  I don't think there's anybody here.
[1207.03s -> 1208.39s]  Oh shit, there's somebody here.
[1210.41s -> 1211.29s]  Oh shit.
[1211.29s -> 1212.65s]  All right, I think we have our own lane though.
[1213.37s -> 1218.17s]  This is like a general bowling alley.
[1218.17s -> 1219.93s]  On the friend page you can click go to.
[1221.13s -> 1222.33s]  Sending me to you.
[1222.41s -> 1223.37s]  And we can be friends.
[1224.25s -> 1225.29s]  I'm right behind you.
[1225.29s -> 1226.49s]  Wow, let's me sneak in.
[1226.49s -> 1227.05s]  I don't know, man.
[1227.05s -> 1227.69s]  I got nothing.
[1227.69s -> 1228.17s]  I got nothing.
[1228.97s -> 1229.72s]  I don't know.
[1229.72s -> 1230.52s]  It's a different game mode.
[1230.52s -> 1230.92s]  All right.
[1230.92s -> 1232.12s]  Um, should we just?
[1233.56s -> 1235.40s]  Hey, Jeremy, your pee pee small.
[1238.14s -> 1238.78s]  Where's Jeremy?
[1238.78s -> 1240.22s]  How the fuck would they even know?
[1240.22s -> 1240.78s]  God damn it.
[1240.78s -> 1241.10s]  How do I?
[1242.22s -> 1243.82s]  Because you've been here for 10 seconds.
[1247.22s -> 1248.82s]  We didn't go that way.
[1248.82s -> 1250.26s]  And we're doing that one.
[1250.26s -> 1254.10s]  Let me show you guys a thing or two in a hole.
[1254.10s -> 1254.82s]  Where's Star?
[1254.82s -> 1255.22s]  Get over here.
[1257.46s -> 1258.34s]  Where are you?
[1258.79s -> 1261.43s]  We just ordered a pizza on the scoreboard to play.
[1265.94s -> 1267.00s]  I'm going to get a strike.
[1268.18s -> 1277.85s]  Oh, he's so lost.
[1277.85s -> 1281.74s]  He's so lost that he has no idea what he's doing.
[1282.62s -> 1284.74s]  Do we have to be in different lanes?
[1284.74s -> 1286.10s]  All right, let's take the one over here.
[1289.38s -> 1292.90s]  We maybe maybe we should just do our own private lobby.
[1294.94s -> 1295.74s]  That's what I'm figuring.
[1295.74s -> 1296.22s]  I'm going to do.
[1298.66s -> 1299.38s]  God damn it.
[1299.38s -> 1300.42s]  I'm fucking going to get hurt.
[1308.60s -> 1310.20s]  Do we can do private.
[1310.20s -> 1311.00s]  We're going to do private.
[1311.00s -> 1311.64s]  We'll do private.
[1312.60s -> 1314.12s]  All right, get out of here.
[1314.12s -> 1316.92s]  All right, I think I made a room.
[1316.92s -> 1317.88s]  I don't know if it's private.
[1317.88s -> 1319.24s]  OK, you made a room.
[1319.24s -> 1319.64s]  People.
[1319.64s -> 1321.56s]  And then on friends, you can do go to mains.
[1322.12s -> 1323.16s]  Oh, yeah, this is private.
[1324.28s -> 1327.16s]  OK, hopefully that's not like the password.
[1328.28s -> 1329.40s]  I hope that's not the password.
[1331.27s -> 1332.15s]  What is this person doing?
[1333.30s -> 1333.94s]  Get out of here.
[1334.90s -> 1335.70s]  Get away from me.
[1335.70s -> 1336.82s]  All right, how do I join?
[1338.09s -> 1339.61s]  All right, go to people.
[1339.61s -> 1340.81s]  I just subscribe to you.
[1340.81s -> 1342.09s]  I just subscribe to you.
[1348.23s -> 1349.11s]  I've invited you.
[1352.28s -> 1353.56s]  No, that's inventions.
[1358.39s -> 1359.19s]  Am I stupid?
[1360.95s -> 1361.27s]  Yes.
[1362.15s -> 1362.79s]  All right, I see.
[1362.79s -> 1363.59s]  OK, messages.
[1364.23s -> 1365.19s]  Game invite.
[1365.19s -> 1365.43s]  Open.
[1366.31s -> 1366.79s]  Do you want?
[1366.79s -> 1367.51s]  Yes, let's go.
[1368.31s -> 1372.52s]  OK, look, God.
[1376.76s -> 1378.12s]  Hey, there you are.
[1378.12s -> 1383.00s]  Hey, I reserved the entire bowling alley.
[1383.08s -> 1384.12s]  So we could be friends.
[1384.12s -> 1385.08s]  He's a billionaire.
[1385.08s -> 1386.04s]  He's a millionaire.
[1386.04s -> 1387.08s]  He's a millionaire.
[1394.97s -> 1397.05s]  All right, you ready to bowl for real?
[1398.76s -> 1399.00s]  Yeah.
[1402.38s -> 1403.82s]  He's trying to pick up the chair.
[1403.82s -> 1406.26s]  I'm trying to pick it up.
[1406.26s -> 1407.38s]  Can we play pool, too?
[1407.38s -> 1408.66s]  Wow, you are really short.
[1409.38s -> 1412.26s]  No, have you just noticed that you're a monster in every single lobby?
[1412.82s -> 1414.58s]  You're just a gigantic person.
[1416.70s -> 1418.38s]  I wouldn't be surprised if you.
[1422.04s -> 1423.40s]  He's going to start a VR fight.
[1424.41s -> 1425.53s]  We got that coming up later.
[1426.09s -> 1427.45s]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you something.
[1427.45s -> 1430.01s]  You want to stick around because we've got a fun fighting game.
[1430.01s -> 1430.65s]  What did I just do?
[1433.02s -> 1433.74s]  Who's turn is it?
[1434.54s -> 1443.50s]  Um, I'm not that you're really just making this so hard for me.
[1443.50s -> 1443.90s]  Me?
[1443.90s -> 1444.30s]  Why?
[1444.30s -> 1446.62s]  Why couldn't you have known that you were going to be on my live stream?
[1446.62s -> 1448.86s]  You could have brought your lighthouses down two feet.
[1449.74s -> 1451.22s]  I don't know what that means.
[1452.18s -> 1454.34s]  How do you pick up a ball?
[1455.14s -> 1459.94s]  Do you have a ball?
[1460.66s -> 1463.54s]  No, I don't know.
[1463.54s -> 1464.34s]  I have no idea.
[1465.06s -> 1466.90s]  How does anyone figure out this game?
[1467.54s -> 1470.10s]  Okay, literal children are playing this right now.
[1470.10s -> 1470.66s]  You understand?
[1470.66s -> 1471.62s]  We're adults.
[1471.62s -> 1472.50s]  We have to figure this out.
[1474.10s -> 1475.22s]  But first, I'm going to get a drink.
[1477.90s -> 1478.78s]  Paul, there's a bowling shirt.
[1478.78s -> 1479.50s]  Hold on.
[1479.50s -> 1479.90s]  What's this?
[1480.54s -> 1481.26s]  Coffee or something?
[1481.90s -> 1483.88s]  Free donuts?
[1488.74s -> 1489.24s]  Yay.
[1491.19s -> 1491.91s]  What does that mean?
[1492.63s -> 1493.19s]  You want a slice?
[1493.75s -> 1494.47s]  There's a wall there.
[1496.97s -> 1499.13s]  He's like looking in the instructional manual.
[1500.73s -> 1501.77s]  How do we play the game?
[1502.73s -> 1503.61s]  It says practice.
[1504.17s -> 1506.09s]  It says game in progress, but it says practice.
[1509.88s -> 1510.60s]  I got to turn this off.
[1512.26s -> 1514.18s]  How do I disable notifications?
[1518.54s -> 1519.66s]  Personal space.
[1519.66s -> 1520.94s]  Ignore bubble.
[1520.94s -> 1525.50s]  Okay, that's good.
[1525.50s -> 1526.38s]  All right.
[1526.38s -> 1527.18s]  Did you figure it out?
[1528.14s -> 1529.58s]  I mean, it should be my turn.
[1529.58s -> 1530.78s]  There's just no balls.
[1530.78s -> 1531.10s]  All right, guys.
[1531.10s -> 1531.82s]  What are we doing wrong?
[1539.69s -> 1540.33s]  What are we doing wrong?
[1540.89s -> 1544.14s]  I think we're playing rec room.
[1545.18s -> 1545.74s]  Well, let's see.
[1545.74s -> 1547.10s]  Maybe somebody says no clue.
[1547.10s -> 1547.82s]  We need balls.
[1549.64s -> 1551.40s]  We need to do an official game mode.
[1554.44s -> 1556.20s]  Just run down and kick the pin.
[1557.16s -> 1557.88s]  You can't.
[1557.88s -> 1558.68s]  I tried.
[1561.66s -> 1563.26s]  Did you like press a button over here?
[1563.98s -> 1566.09s]  We both had to press start.
[1566.73s -> 1567.96s]  I pressed start.
[1568.60s -> 1569.58s]  What's that?
[1572.20s -> 1575.43s]  Uh, you're the host.
[1575.43s -> 1585.24s]  These two old fucks lost in a kids game.
[1586.12s -> 1587.21s]  You have an idea?
[1588.49s -> 1589.45s]  Oh, you lost.
[1590.09s -> 1590.57s]  Who won?
[1590.57s -> 1592.17s]  I found out how to end the game.
[1592.17s -> 1595.69s]  Okay, this is FFA sandbox.
[1595.69s -> 1598.97s]  That's the problem that we're having here.
[1598.97s -> 1600.33s]  We don't want to do sandbox.
[1600.33s -> 1604.36s]  Two team, just you versus me.
[1604.36s -> 1605.64s]  Not free for all sandbox.
[1605.64s -> 1606.44s]  Me, two teams.
[1607.96s -> 1609.24s]  Two team sandbox.
[1609.24s -> 1609.96s]  Me versus you.
[1610.52s -> 1611.72s]  Game starts in three seconds.
[1611.72s -> 1612.12s]  Here we go.
[1613.48s -> 1614.04s]  Game on.
[1616.41s -> 1616.73s]  All right.
[1616.73s -> 1617.45s]  Who's up first?
[1618.17s -> 1618.73s]  Me.
[1618.73s -> 1630.17s]  Like, dude, I bet this is like you need to buy the ball and have it in your inventory.
[1630.17s -> 1632.41s]  You definitely don't have to buy the ball.
[1632.41s -> 1633.77s]  No, you have to buy the ball.
[1634.49s -> 1636.90s]  The balls are in the front?
[1637.62s -> 1651.93s]  Balls in the front?
[1652.57s -> 1654.74s]  Like in the lockers?
[1660.55s -> 1663.27s]  Uh, somebody said under tail front.
[1663.27s -> 1664.15s]  Under tail front.
[1668.06s -> 1670.86s]  Hey, we're not in the bowling game mode.
[1670.86s -> 1672.38s]  We're in the bowling room.
[1673.10s -> 1674.90s]  Well, what's the difference?
[1674.90s -> 1675.38s]  I don't know.
[1675.38s -> 1676.98s]  I guess this is like not the bowling game.
[1676.98s -> 1679.22s]  This is like the hang out with your friends in the bowling alley.
[1679.94s -> 1683.02s]  But it goes somewhere different.
[1683.02s -> 1683.74s]  Take it somewhere.
[1684.46s -> 1689.14s]  I don't know.
[1689.14s -> 1690.42s]  We're not going to have bowling shoes on.
[1691.45s -> 1691.77s]  Whatever.
[1691.77s -> 1692.89s]  Just go on our bare feet.
[1693.53s -> 1694.34s]  We'll be fine.
[1694.90s -> 1700.98s]  To your right.
[1703.82s -> 1704.54s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[1704.54s -> 1705.34s]  Don't do anything yet.
[1705.34s -> 1705.74s]  Stop it.
[1706.38s -> 1710.63s]  Is that activated?
[1711.72s -> 1712.52s]  No, that didn't do it.
[1712.52s -> 1713.40s]  No, no, no.
[1713.40s -> 1714.04s]  Just go.
[1714.04s -> 1715.48s]  Just get the fuck out of here.
[1715.48s -> 1716.12s]  No, that was wrong.
[1719.80s -> 1722.12s]  Like, like walk through here to activate.
[1724.82s -> 1726.50s]  I'm just going to like put your head down in there.
[1727.14s -> 1732.73s]  Can I see what you're doing?
[1733.69s -> 1733.93s]  No.
[1737.03s -> 1738.87s]  I don't know what's going to make these any different.
[1739.93s -> 1741.29s]  We're just going to be in a room.
[1747.59s -> 1750.39s]  To create a private room, open your watch and press on play.
[1750.39s -> 1753.03s]  Then find the room you want to create a private version of.
[1753.03s -> 1756.87s]  Afterwards, instead of clicking the icon, click the exclamation button.
[1756.87s -> 1757.27s]  Close that.
[1757.27s -> 1757.83s]  I missed it.
[1758.55s -> 1767.42s]  It looks like an old motherfucker on an iPad.
[1767.42s -> 1769.50s]  That's like what my grandfather does when he's on his iPhone.
[1772.12s -> 1774.52s]  Like, oh, you're not going to send a text.
[1775.24s -> 1777.22s]  We good?
[1778.34s -> 1778.58s]  No.
[1779.38s -> 1779.94s]  All right, hold on.
[1781.90s -> 1784.22s]  Click the, close the name of the room.
[1784.22s -> 1785.50s]  Then press on private.
[1786.87s -> 1788.87s]  And voila, you now have a private room.
[1788.87s -> 1790.07s]  I'm thinking, I'm close.
[1790.07s -> 1790.55s]  I'm getting close.
[1791.43s -> 1800.15s]  Does somebody just said I'm the most obnoxious streamer on Twitch?
[1800.95s -> 1803.13s]  It's, that's not true.
[1805.99s -> 1806.47s]  Why?
[1806.47s -> 1807.67s]  What did I, what did I do?
[1815.88s -> 1817.72s]  You couldn't figure out how to play bowling.
[1819.50s -> 1822.46s]  Well, dude, I'm following the instructions and they're.
[1823.10s -> 1824.94s]  Let me see what happens when I, let me think of it to try.
[1825.50s -> 1827.18s]  I'm a little like, I'm a little younger than you.
[1827.18s -> 1828.22s]  So yeah.
[1829.10s -> 1829.42s]  Okay.
[1829.42s -> 1830.06s]  Let's see here.
[1832.44s -> 1841.56s]  You're not, but I got it.
[1841.56s -> 1842.36s]  Me and you dodgeball.
[1842.36s -> 1843.16s]  Let's go for real.
[1844.20s -> 1845.74s]  I'm going to invite you.
[1845.74s -> 1847.42s]  I figured it out in 10 seconds.
[1847.42s -> 1848.70s]  Oh my God.
[1848.70s -> 1851.62s]  If you like, you can practice until more players arrive.
[1852.58s -> 1853.62s]  Waiting for the invite.
[1854.58s -> 1859.32s]  Come on in.
[1859.32s -> 1868.86s]  I would kind of already did this, but with a paddle.
[1870.54s -> 1871.10s]  All right.
[1871.10s -> 1872.06s]  We're on different teams, right?
[1872.06s -> 1872.86s]  But no.
[1872.86s -> 1873.82s]  Ready to start.
[1873.82s -> 1874.62s]  Why did you just do that?
[1875.66s -> 1877.02s]  You and I are on the same side of the court.
[1878.38s -> 1879.26s]  What color is your shirt?
[1880.62s -> 1882.06s]  I can't see my own shirt.
[1882.06s -> 1882.62s]  You're blue.
[1883.90s -> 1885.18s]  All right, here we go.
[1885.18s -> 1885.50s]  You ready?
[1886.14s -> 1889.50s]  Dodgeball.
[1897.16s -> 1897.64s]  Put away.
[1899.69s -> 1900.73s]  I punched him by.
[1904.06s -> 1904.30s]  All right.
[1911.50s -> 1912.22s]  Can I get that one?
[1912.22s -> 1912.46s]  No.
[1916.68s -> 1918.44s]  You don't have legs that went through you.
[1919.24s -> 1921.22s]  We don't have any more balls.
[1924.98s -> 1925.30s]  Okay.
[1925.94s -> 1926.50s]  Here it comes.
[1926.50s -> 1926.98s]  You ready?
[1926.98s -> 1927.94s]  I'm going to hit something.
[1932.62s -> 1934.78s]  How do these go slower than the paddle ball?
[1935.82s -> 1937.74s]  I don't know, but how can we not do this?
[1938.38s -> 1939.74s]  Why are we so awful at this?
[1946.02s -> 1947.38s]  There's no way you could hit me.
[1949.38s -> 1950.42s]  Who's doing the move?
[1951.78s -> 1953.06s]  You're doing a doggy paddle.
[1955.11s -> 1955.51s]  Don't fear.
[1955.51s -> 1956.39s]  You can teleport.
[1957.42s -> 1958.06s]  That's the BS.
[1958.06s -> 1958.78s]  Like that block?
[1959.34s -> 1960.30s]  That's too convenient.
[1969.16s -> 1969.72s]  All right.
[1969.72s -> 1970.36s]  Now you're fucked.
[1970.36s -> 1970.68s]  Ready?
[1979.88s -> 1980.76s]  Can you not catch?
[1985.21s -> 1985.77s]  Here, here.
[1985.77s -> 1986.89s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1986.89s -> 1987.29s]  Wait.
[1987.29s -> 1989.53s]  If I was 11, this would be the most fun I've ever had.
[1989.53s -> 1989.77s]  Wait.
[1991.77s -> 1992.41s]  I said wait.
[1993.45s -> 1996.41s]  I'm going to toss it up gently and try and catch it.
[1996.41s -> 1997.13s]  Okay.
[1997.13s -> 1997.37s]  Okay.
[2000.79s -> 2002.39s]  I didn't know that was real.
[2002.39s -> 2005.13s]  Okay.
[2005.13s -> 2005.85s]  You can catch it.
[2006.90s -> 2007.78s]  Oh, look at that.
[2007.78s -> 2008.66s]  Oh, what do you know?
[2008.66s -> 2009.54s]  Spin it around a little bit.
[2021.90s -> 2022.94s]  It's so loud.
[2024.30s -> 2024.94s]  It shouldn't be.
[2036.60s -> 2038.74s]  Come on.
[2038.74s -> 2046.36s]  Why would I do that?
[2048.28s -> 2052.46s]  Hey, under that.
[2053.67s -> 2054.07s]  All right.
[2055.19s -> 2056.23s]  Are you sick?
[2056.23s -> 2056.71s]  Are you sick?
[2056.71s -> 2059.11s]  This is the worst game of dodgeball you've ever played.
[2062.95s -> 2067.80s]  Can you hit yourself in the face?
[2077.08s -> 2077.64s]  Oh, fuck.
[2078.28s -> 2081.22s]  How many, hey, how many times have you ran into like your desk?
[2082.84s -> 2083.40s]  Not once.
[2088.09s -> 2088.41s]  Next.
[2091.75s -> 2092.31s]  Tell me, check one.
[2092.31s -> 2092.95s]  Let's get one more.
[2094.97s -> 2095.29s]  Next.
[2096.09s -> 2098.81s]  We didn't spend no money to not get out of here in 15 seconds.
[2100.14s -> 2101.42s]  I mean different game.
[2101.42s -> 2104.31s]  Like, not dodgeball.
[2105.03s -> 2105.83s]  Okay.
[2105.83s -> 2106.23s]  Uh-huh.
[2108.82s -> 2109.86s]  Never have I ever.
[2110.50s -> 2111.54s]  Rec room restaurant.
[2111.54s -> 2112.26s]  Rec restaurant.
[2112.26s -> 2112.98s]  That's what we're doing.
[2112.98s -> 2113.30s]  Shit.
[2113.70s -> 2114.82s]  I went to the public one.
[2115.62s -> 2116.98s]  It's just going to be a hangout.
[2117.70s -> 2121.94s]  I got to move this.
[2122.50s -> 2128.02s]  I went to a public restaurant.
[2130.65s -> 2131.45s]  Big mistake.
[2132.25s -> 2140.68s]  You seem actually fucking hanging out in here.
[2141.64s -> 2142.92s]  Pretending to be in a cafeteria.
[2158.47s -> 2161.94s]  Come over here.
[2164.58s -> 2164.90s]  Hold on.
[2164.90s -> 2165.54s]  Put your mic on.
[2166.26s -> 2167.62s]  It's going to sound terrible, but we need to.
[2172.22s -> 2173.74s]  So this is the place I was talking about.
[2174.46s -> 2177.06s]  They got pretty good burgers here.
[2177.78s -> 2181.22s]  They got an excellent, excellent garlic aioli that goes on top of it, too.
[2181.22s -> 2181.78s]  It's pretty great.
[2183.37s -> 2186.41s]  Did you do use open table to get us a reservation here?
[2187.93s -> 2188.17s]  No.
[2189.05s -> 2189.37s]  Okay.
[2190.17s -> 2191.72s]  Okay.
[2191.72s -> 2192.68s]  Let's go ahead and just...
[2192.68s -> 2193.96s]  That's a snowman.
[2193.96s -> 2194.60s]  Excuse me?
[2194.60s -> 2195.80s]  Does anybody work here?
[2203.61s -> 2203.85s]  Oh.
[2204.57s -> 2205.85s]  Hey, you should be his new boss.
[2205.85s -> 2209.05s]  He has lots of restaurant experience this guy.
[2209.05s -> 2211.77s]  He runs Michelin star restaurants.
[2211.77s -> 2214.42s]  Oh, that's great because this place is in a state of disrepair.
[2214.42s -> 2215.70s]  It's complete chaos here.
[2215.70s -> 2217.70s]  Wait, who needs menus?
[2218.66s -> 2219.22s]  Oh, okay.
[2219.22s -> 2219.54s]  Let me see.
[2220.98s -> 2221.62s]  No, that's okay.
[2221.62s -> 2222.90s]  I know it's your first day.
[2222.90s -> 2223.94s]  I believe they do.
[2223.94s -> 2224.74s]  I need the menus.
[2225.70s -> 2227.14s]  Wait, do you work here?
[2227.14s -> 2227.38s]  Okay.
[2228.74s -> 2232.02s]  Burger minus steak equals pizza.
[2235.83s -> 2237.91s]  Can we just throw a brick through the window?
[2243.05s -> 2243.37s]  Okay.
[2245.93s -> 2246.81s]  Uh, I think...
[2247.85s -> 2249.05s]  Can I get just a glass of water?
[2251.45s -> 2252.89s]  Can I just get a glass of water?
[2256.73s -> 2257.37s]  No, that's okay.
[2258.09s -> 2258.65s]  That's okay.
[2260.57s -> 2261.13s]  Everything going?
[2261.13s -> 2262.09s]  Everything okay back here?
[2262.89s -> 2263.93s]  Can you pick a table?
[2263.93s -> 2265.61s]  Because you're blocking the way.
[2268.41s -> 2269.53s]  I think we need to get seated.
[2271.13s -> 2272.89s]  Oh, that's the VIP table.
[2272.89s -> 2274.01s]  What do you want, sir?
[2274.01s -> 2274.57s]  Let you sit.
[2274.57s -> 2275.61s]  Anyone want to sit?
[2275.61s -> 2275.93s]  Sit.
[2275.93s -> 2279.85s]  Uh, that candle is made for any of the other tables you see here.
[2280.41s -> 2281.29s]  Guys, what do you want?
[2281.93s -> 2283.21s]  So I heard about this place on Yelp.
[2284.73s -> 2289.53s]  I come to New City, and I try to go to Yelp when I go to the top 10 on Yelp,
[2289.53s -> 2290.49s]  and this was number two.
[2290.49s -> 2293.05s]  So we're, you know, really hoping for big things here.
[2295.37s -> 2298.14s]  So I guess, uh, you ready to order?
[2298.14s -> 2301.74s]  Because I looked at the extensive menu that you guys have.
[2301.74s -> 2303.74s]  Anyone want a candle?
[2304.94s -> 2305.98s]  I think I will have...
[2305.98s -> 2307.18s]  I got it under control here.
[2307.18s -> 2311.18s]  I think I'm going to have the, uh, the hamburger here.
[2311.82s -> 2313.42s]  Can I get that medium, please?
[2313.42s -> 2314.54s]  No, I'm sorry.
[2314.54s -> 2315.42s]  I'm so sorry.
[2316.78s -> 2317.42s]  Sorry what?
[2317.42s -> 2318.94s]  You can order here if you want.
[2318.94s -> 2321.50s]  I'm going to, uh, check our stock real quick.
[2323.18s -> 2324.14s]  It's okay.
[2324.14s -> 2325.10s]  It's, uh, it's all right.
[2325.10s -> 2325.98s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[2325.98s -> 2326.46s]  It's okay.
[2326.46s -> 2327.34s]  I'm doing okay.
[2327.34s -> 2328.78s]  I can't, I don't know how to sit down.
[2330.14s -> 2330.78s]  I need you first.
[2330.78s -> 2331.28s]  Okay.
[2332.22s -> 2333.18s]  You're standing on the seat.
[2333.18s -> 2333.68s]  What are you doing?
[2333.68s -> 2336.18s]  I'm standing on the seat.
[2336.18s -> 2336.68s]  Oh, okay.
[2336.68s -> 2337.18s]  Hold me.
[2337.18s -> 2337.68s]  Hang on.
[2337.68s -> 2338.18s]  Let me...
[2338.18s -> 2339.18s]  Can I help you?
[2339.18s -> 2342.68s]  I'm not supposed to be doing this at three and a half on Yelp so far.
[2342.68s -> 2344.18s]  You ever do a SlavSquad?
[2344.18s -> 2344.68s]  Yeah.
[2344.68s -> 2345.68s]  Sir, can I help you?
[2345.68s -> 2347.18s]  That is one short streamer.
[2347.18s -> 2347.68s]  There we go.
[2347.68s -> 2348.68s]  That's just SlavSquad.
[2348.68s -> 2349.68s]  Who said that?
[2349.68s -> 2350.68s]  It's just nice.
[2350.68s -> 2351.68s]  Don't bloody throw cards.
[2351.68s -> 2353.18s]  Please do not insult our guests.
[2353.18s -> 2354.68s]  Don't throw cards.
[2357.24s -> 2358.24s]  Do you know what you're going to order?
[2358.24s -> 2359.24s]  Don't throw cards.
[2359.24s -> 2361.24s]  Because I ordered a hamburger and we got a fucking pizza.
[2361.24s -> 2361.74s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[2361.74s -> 2362.74s]  I probably shouldn't have said that.
[2362.74s -> 2364.74s]  I want the Bean Eagles pizza.
[2365.74s -> 2367.91s]  That employee.
[2367.91s -> 2369.91s]  You're going to have to talk about this employee.
[2369.91s -> 2372.91s]  Because that was like the mistake number five.
[2372.91s -> 2374.91s]  It's okay. I work here.
[2376.22s -> 2377.22s]  Well, it's now two.
[2377.22s -> 2379.22s]  Can I get some fireman's and chat?
[2379.22s -> 2380.22s]  But it's okay.
[2380.22s -> 2382.22s]  How are you sitting?
[2382.22s -> 2384.22s]  I sat down in my room.
[2384.22s -> 2386.22s]  Okay, so...
[2387.22s -> 2391.94s]  What happened to my mug?
[2391.94s -> 2393.57s]  You know what?
[2393.57s -> 2394.07s]  No, no, no.
[2394.07s -> 2396.07s]  I want to see the kitchen.
[2397.57s -> 2398.57s]  I want to see the kitchen.
[2400.13s -> 2401.13s]  Damn it.
[2401.13s -> 2402.13s]  I want to see the kitchen.
[2402.13s -> 2403.13s]  Oh, shit.
[2403.13s -> 2404.13s]  Oh, God.
[2404.13s -> 2405.13s]  Somebody call the police.
[2405.13s -> 2406.13s]  I'm sorry.
[2406.13s -> 2409.62s]  I hit the table.
[2409.62s -> 2410.62s]  Oh, my God.
[2410.62s -> 2413.25s]  Who is sitting this close to me?
[2413.25s -> 2414.25s]  What's going on?
[2414.25s -> 2416.25s]  You took a photo of me in the restaurant?
[2416.25s -> 2417.25s]  Yeah.
[2417.25s -> 2418.25s]  Yeah.
[2418.25s -> 2419.25s]  I'm sorry.
[2419.25s -> 2421.25s]  I mean, you could have asked permission for it.
[2421.25s -> 2422.25s]  Like all these cameras.
[2422.25s -> 2423.25s]  Can you believe this?
[2423.25s -> 2424.25s]  This is ridiculous.
[2424.25s -> 2426.25s]  We're just being followed.
[2426.25s -> 2427.25s]  I don't believe it.
[2427.25s -> 2428.25s]  We're being robbed.
[2428.25s -> 2430.25s]  Give the pizza burger back.
[2430.25s -> 2431.74s]  Jesus.
[2431.74s -> 2434.18s]  If I don't get a pizza burger back...
[2434.18s -> 2436.18s]  I'm trying to enjoy my meal.
[2437.18s -> 2439.18s]  Help me get the burger back.
[2439.18s -> 2440.18s]  All right.
[2440.18s -> 2441.18s]  It's probably time to call the police.
[2441.18s -> 2442.18s]  So I'll see you anyway.
[2442.18s -> 2443.18s]  Don't say, oh, my God.
[2443.18s -> 2444.18s]  Yeah.
[2444.18s -> 2445.18s]  Let's go to the police.
[2445.18s -> 2446.18s]  Does anyone have a...
[2446.18s -> 2447.18s]  I don't know how to...
[2447.18s -> 2448.18s]  It's my watch.
[2448.18s -> 2449.18s]  Oh, hey, look.
[2449.18s -> 2450.18s]  I got a camera.
[2450.18s -> 2451.18s]  I can't be in there.
[2451.18s -> 2452.18s]  Unbelievable.
[2452.18s -> 2453.18s]  Chug, chug, chug.
[2455.18s -> 2456.18s]  Did anyone order pizza anyway?
[2456.18s -> 2458.18s]  Like I'll have a half-eaten pizza.
[2458.18s -> 2459.18s]  Half-eaten slice?
[2459.18s -> 2460.18s]  Like...
[2461.18s -> 2462.18s]  Half-eaten slice, anyone?
[2462.18s -> 2463.18s]  Woo-hoo!
[2465.18s -> 2467.18s]  Oh, I just ripped the corner.
[2469.18s -> 2470.18s]  All right, can we...
[2470.18s -> 2471.18s]  I don't...
[2472.18s -> 2473.18s]  Can we...
[2474.18s -> 2475.18s]  Is this what I looked like?
[2475.18s -> 2477.18s]  Why do I look like Doug Fuddy?
[2482.18s -> 2483.18s]  I ordered the hamburger.
[2483.18s -> 2484.18s]  I ordered the hamburger.
[2484.18s -> 2485.18s]  It was me.
[2485.18s -> 2486.18s]  Sorry.
[2488.18s -> 2490.18s]  There's a piece of cheese and two pieces of bread.
[2493.18s -> 2496.35s]  Did you even try, mate?
[2496.35s -> 2497.35s]  Look at this.
[2497.35s -> 2498.35s]  Look at this.
[2500.35s -> 2502.59s]  A slice of cheese.
[2502.59s -> 2503.59s]  That's all that's in there.
[2503.59s -> 2504.59s]  Fucking rubbish.
[2509.79s -> 2510.79s]  Did you just take that from me?
[2512.79s -> 2513.79s]  Stop swearing!
[2513.79s -> 2514.79s]  My voice cracked.
[2515.79s -> 2516.79s]  Oh, sorry.
[2529.65s -> 2533.00s]  I don't have access.
[2540.25s -> 2541.25s]  I paid in...
[2543.25s -> 2544.62s]  I paid in photos.
[2545.62s -> 2547.94s]  Yeah, I'm out.
[2558.44s -> 2559.44s]  You paid in exposure.
[2559.44s -> 2560.44s]  Exposure.
[2566.29s -> 2567.29s]  How do I get out of here?
[2567.29s -> 2571.77s]  All right, are we moving on?
[2572.77s -> 2574.01s]  I don't know.
[2574.01s -> 2576.01s]  Were there any other actual games?
[2576.01s -> 2578.01s]  We can go to featured games.
[2579.57s -> 2583.57s]  There's Paintball, Golden Trophy, The Streets, Newtown, Reborn.
[2584.57s -> 2587.28s]  We did a couple of these.
[2587.28s -> 2588.28s]  Hide and Seek?
[2590.29s -> 2591.29s]  You want to play Hide and Seek?
[2591.29s -> 2592.29s]  Just me and you?
[2592.29s -> 2593.29s]  Oh my god, no.
[2595.29s -> 2597.66s]  Lemonade Simulator?
[2602.74s -> 2603.74s]  There's Minigolf.
[2604.74s -> 2606.04s]  Oh, Minigolf!
[2607.04s -> 2608.04s]  I don't want to play that game.
[2608.04s -> 2609.04s]  Minigolf is...
[2610.04s -> 2611.04s]  I don't think it's very fun.
[2612.28s -> 2613.28s]  What do you guys think?
[2613.28s -> 2618.06s]  I don't know why you can't make a private one.
[2624.16s -> 2626.16s]  Everyone's screaming to do Minigolf.
[2627.91s -> 2628.91s]  Do Furry Hangout.
[2628.91s -> 2629.91s]  What are you talking about?
[2631.91s -> 2633.73s]  No, I ain't doing that.
[2634.73s -> 2642.54s]  All right, let's do Slender Eight Pages.
[2645.54s -> 2647.61s]  That would be on here.
[2648.61s -> 2650.61s]  You're going to do Slender Man Eight Pages?
[2650.61s -> 2651.85s]  I'll follow you.
[2652.85s -> 2653.85s]  Does somebody get to be Slender Man?
[2653.85s -> 2654.85s]  It would be you.
[2658.01s -> 2659.01s]  I'm done being tall.
[2662.81s -> 2663.81s]  How do we start?
[2663.81s -> 2667.10s]  Can't run.
[2668.10s -> 2669.10s]  Always watch us.
[2669.10s -> 2670.10s]  Don't look.
[2670.10s -> 2672.78s]  If I can't join you, it says game full.
[2674.09s -> 2675.39s]  Really?
[2675.39s -> 2676.39s]  Come up.
[2677.39s -> 2680.21s]  I actually think it's only two people get into the woods.
[2680.21s -> 2681.21s]  Just me and you.
[2682.21s -> 2686.71s]  Yeah, it's just me.
[2686.71s -> 2687.71s]  There we go.
[2687.71s -> 2688.71s]  All right.
[2688.71s -> 2689.71s]  Only two can enter.
[2689.71s -> 2690.71s]  Hey.
[2690.71s -> 2691.71s]  Hey.
[2691.71s -> 2692.71s]  What's going on?
[2692.71s -> 2693.71s]  How does it feel being up there?
[2694.71s -> 2695.71s]  Feels pretty good.
[2696.71s -> 2698.71s]  Why can I not hit you on the head?
[2699.71s -> 2701.71s]  Because this is a non-violent game.
[2703.14s -> 2704.14s]  The only thing you can do is...
[2705.14s -> 2706.38s]  Okay, that was funny.
[2707.38s -> 2708.38s]  Why did that happen?
[2709.38s -> 2710.38s]  All right, before you go,
[2715.85s -> 2717.85s]  do you want to press this button or what do we do?
[2724.53s -> 2725.53s]  What are you doing?
[2725.53s -> 2727.53s]  No, we didn't even read the rules.
[2727.53s -> 2728.53s]  What are you doing?
[2732.07s -> 2733.07s]  You didn't even let me read the rules.
[2734.07s -> 2741.01s]  I'm in.
[2741.01s -> 2743.59s]  Where are you?
[2743.59s -> 2744.59s]  Throw me a flashlight.
[2744.59s -> 2745.59s]  Get a flashlight.
[2745.59s -> 2746.59s]  Throw me one.
[2747.59s -> 2748.59s]  I'll throw it to you.
[2748.59s -> 2752.97s]  Hold on.
[2752.97s -> 2753.97s]  You have to come get it.
[2753.97s -> 2754.97s]  I can't throw it to you.
[2756.14s -> 2757.14s]  This isn't even doing anything.
[2757.14s -> 2758.14s]  This just hurts.
[2758.14s -> 2760.14s]  This is just like a filter on the screen.
[2760.14s -> 2763.30s]  Here.
[2763.30s -> 2765.44s]  All right.
[2765.44s -> 2766.44s]  This is bad.
[2766.44s -> 2767.44s]  This is...
[2767.44s -> 2768.44s]  I kind of don't want the flashlight.
[2773.78s -> 2774.78s]  Thanks.
[2774.78s -> 2775.78s]  You just put that right in my face.
[2775.78s -> 2776.78s]  All right, let's go.
[2779.87s -> 2780.87s]  So we can find the first page.
[2780.87s -> 2782.69s]  I'm going to welcome that.
[2785.53s -> 2788.70s]  I think your voice is still coming through.
[2788.70s -> 2790.01s]  Oh, yeah.
[2790.01s -> 2791.01s]  I can turn that off.
[2791.01s -> 2793.21s]  Yeah, you definitely should.
[2794.21s -> 2796.34s]  Okay.
[2796.34s -> 2798.71s]  You ready to go find the eight pages?
[2798.71s -> 2799.71s]  Yeah.
[2799.71s -> 2802.53s]  I wish there was a camera on you right now
[2802.53s -> 2804.53s]  because I'd love to know what the hell you're doing.
[2804.53s -> 2806.02s]  I'm crawling.
[2810.08s -> 2811.08s]  I need you.
[2812.08s -> 2814.08s]  Will you stand up and just play?
[2814.08s -> 2816.08s]  You are ruining my street.
[2817.64s -> 2827.84s]  Let's hit it.
[2830.55s -> 2831.55s]  Let's go.
[2834.12s -> 2836.12s]  Hey, behind you, there might be a...
[2836.12s -> 2837.12s]  Is there a page?
[2837.12s -> 2838.12s]  Over there.
[2838.12s -> 2839.12s]  Like...
[2839.12s -> 2841.12s]  He really is right here.
[2841.12s -> 2846.92s]  This is not the Kingdom Hearts version of this character.
[2846.92s -> 2852.27s]  As long as the flashlight's on him, we can not move.
[2852.27s -> 2854.27s]  Look at how muscular his legs are.
[2854.27s -> 2855.27s]  He looks a little inflated.
[2856.27s -> 2858.22s]  You know those things on Halloween?
[2859.22s -> 2861.22s]  That big display that you walk by and they go...
[2865.22s -> 2866.22s]  And they say like a line about eating you.
[2866.22s -> 2867.22s]  That's what this thing is.
[2868.22s -> 2875.54s]  He's going to get you.
[2876.54s -> 2878.99s]  I don't think he will.
[2882.86s -> 2883.86s]  He's ignoring you.
[2883.86s -> 2884.86s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[2886.42s -> 2887.42s]  Go get him.
[2887.42s -> 2888.42s]  What is he doing?
[2890.30s -> 2891.30s]  Let's follow him.
[2891.30s -> 2892.30s]  Alright, yeah, we gotta follow him.
[2894.18s -> 2896.82s]  Hey.
[2896.82s -> 2898.82s]  Is he collecting the notes now?
[2898.82s -> 2901.02s]  Is it his turn?
[2901.02s -> 2902.02s]  Yeah, we're the annoying ones.
[2908.47s -> 2911.99s]  Okay, that's a little odd.
[2911.99s -> 2918.07s]  This is scarier somehow.
[2918.07s -> 2919.07s]  Upbeat.
[2919.07s -> 2920.07s]  Daddy, upbeat.
[2927.78s -> 2929.78s]  Just have him grab you in the face.
[2931.40s -> 2932.40s]  I tried to.
[2932.40s -> 2933.58s]  I think he killed me.
[2934.58s -> 2935.82s]  He killed you.
[2935.82s -> 2940.31s]  I was going to say, maybe we get to trap him like a Ghostbusters proton beam.
[2943.38s -> 2947.74s]  How long have we been in rec room for?
[2947.74s -> 2949.74s]  We've got like four or five other games to play.
[2949.74s -> 2950.74s]  Yeah.
[2950.74s -> 2951.74s]  What's next?
[2952.74s -> 2953.74s]  What do you want to do next?
[2954.74s -> 2956.04s]  I don't remember the list.
[2956.04s -> 2957.98s]  Neither do I.
[2962.17s -> 2963.17s]  We can do Survive.
[2963.17s -> 2964.17s]  What do you want to do?
[2964.17s -> 2966.17s]  That is the only one that I did not download.
[2967.17s -> 2968.17s]  Why didn't you download that?
[2968.17s -> 2973.47s]  It wouldn't start and then I just figured, I figured it'd be fine.
[2973.47s -> 2977.47s]  You didn't download the game, like the co-op horror shooter game.
[2978.47s -> 2979.47s]  It could start.
[2981.61s -> 2983.61s]  Well, start downloading now and we'll play.
[2983.61s -> 2988.61s]  Alright, guys, I got some really, really interesting news for everybody.
[2990.61s -> 2994.61s]  The last thing that we're going to play is Desert Bus VR.
[2994.61s -> 2997.61s]  So we're going to try to take the whole eight hour trip at the end of the stream.
[2997.61s -> 2998.61s]  Oh, wow.
[2998.61s -> 3000.61s]  Star really ruined the stream.
[3001.61s -> 3008.65s]  Dude, just go to the furry room.
[3008.65s -> 3011.46s]  I'll be done downloading in a second.
[3011.46s -> 3012.46s]  Oh my God.
[3012.46s -> 3015.46s]  No, dude, I don't want to.
[3015.46s -> 3018.09s]  You get 15 seconds, okay?
[3018.09s -> 3019.09s]  10 seconds.
[3020.09s -> 3026.17s]  It's just three minutes to download.
[3026.17s -> 3029.62s]  My mic turned the fuck off.
[3029.62s -> 3033.21s]  Three minutes.
[3033.21s -> 3034.21s]  I thought I just did that for a second.
[3034.21s -> 3035.58s]  That was weird.
[3035.58s -> 3036.58s]  Pretty good.
[3036.58s -> 3038.58s]  I'm just going to go and look and I'm going to go and look.
[3038.58s -> 3039.58s]  I just got pressured.
[3039.58s -> 3042.52s]  Alright, you get 15 seconds.
[3042.52s -> 3047.70s]  I don't care if you're a furry.
[3047.70s -> 3048.70s]  It's not a problem.
[3048.70s -> 3050.39s]  I don't give a shit.
[3050.39s -> 3053.02s]  I don't care if you're furry.
[3053.02s -> 3056.66s]  I just don't want to see you.
[3056.66s -> 3058.66s]  How did you know I was going to go there?
[3058.66s -> 3063.78s]  Well, the iron giant is really cool.
[3063.78s -> 3064.78s]  I'll tell you.
[3064.78s -> 3066.78s]  My favorite part about this is the iron giant.
[3066.78s -> 3073.76s]  Is that the iron giant?
[3073.76s -> 3079.22s]  It is.
[3079.22s -> 3080.22s]  Nice.
[3080.22s -> 3081.22s]  Okay.
[3081.22s -> 3082.22s]  Can I come up here?
[3082.22s -> 3083.22s]  No.
[3083.22s -> 3084.22s]  Okay.
[3084.22s -> 3085.78s]  It is.
[3085.78s -> 3088.43s]  Nice.
[3088.43s -> 3089.43s]  Okay.
[3089.43s -> 3092.57s]  Can I come up here and spin records?
[3092.57s -> 3099.25s]  How do I turn this on?
[3099.25s -> 3108.31s]  I think I have to have special DJ permission to use this.
[3108.31s -> 3112.13s]  That's a pretty cool Spyro the dragon costume.
[3112.13s -> 3113.13s]  I want to see it.
[3113.13s -> 3118.22s]  That's a pretty awesome Spyro the dragon.
[3118.22s -> 3127.76s]  Spyro and then I don't know what that other one is.
[3127.76s -> 3130.15s]  What's going on?
[3130.15s -> 3132.15s]  Is this stuff going on up here?
[3132.15s -> 3134.03s]  That's a VIP area.
[3134.03s -> 3136.03s]  You can't go up there unless you're VIP.
[3136.03s -> 3138.03s]  I'm going to respect the rules.
[3138.03s -> 3139.03s]  Here's the newest costumes.
[3139.03s -> 3140.03s]  Okay.
[3140.03s -> 3143.42s]  Spyro the dragon.
[3143.42s -> 3144.42s]  What did I tell you?
[3144.42s -> 3152.83s]  Uh oh.
[3152.83s -> 3155.93s]  All right.
[3155.93s -> 3158.81s]  Survive is I'm launching it.
[3158.81s -> 3162.11s]  Am I stealing a costume?
[3162.11s -> 3164.93s]  I think I'm actually, I think I'm taking this.
[3164.93s -> 3166.93s]  No, I got to put this back.
[3166.93s -> 3167.93s]  It's that.
[3167.93s -> 3172.18s]  All right.
[3172.18s -> 3173.18s]  You're launching it?
[3173.18s -> 3174.48s]  Yeah.
[3174.48s -> 3175.48s]  There you go.
[3175.48s -> 3176.48s]  There's your 15 seconds.
[3176.48s -> 3189.30s]  Okay.
[3189.30s -> 3193.36s]  How do I get out?
[3193.36s -> 3195.37s]  What's the out button?
[3195.37s -> 3196.37s]  Dorm room right here.
[3196.37s -> 3199.46s]  This is actually pretty cool.
[3199.46s -> 3202.46s]  If you could make something get like in a cool room with your friends hanging out
[3203.46s -> 3206.46s]  You know what my favorite thing about your streams is?
[3206.46s -> 3210.46s]  Is after you play like a shit game for an hour, you always come out with the positives.
[3210.46s -> 3216.20s]  How is this a shit game?
[3216.20s -> 3219.78s]  Is Roblox a shit game?
[3219.78s -> 3224.84s]  You don't have to answer that.
[3224.84s -> 3230.05s]  I didn't even do this.
[3230.05s -> 3232.05s]  This is why I look like a default character.
[3232.05s -> 3234.29s]  I didn't have any personality for God's sakes.
[3234.29s -> 3235.29s]  All right.
[3235.29s -> 3237.91s]  Let me just take off my toupee.
[3237.91s -> 3238.91s]  Put it on there.
[3238.91s -> 3242.71s]  All right.
[3242.71s -> 3243.71s]  I'm going to open up Survive.
[3243.71s -> 3246.71s]  First I have to like YouTube or funny break something.
[3246.71s -> 3249.74s]  It didn't even work.
[3249.74s -> 3251.37s]  All right.
[3251.37s -> 3253.37s]  Time to change games to Survive.
[3253.37s -> 3256.99s]  In fact, let me just pull up for a second.
[3256.99s -> 3262.97s]  All right.
[3262.97s -> 3265.23s]  There we go.
[3265.23s -> 3267.23s]  So you in Survive right now?
[3267.23s -> 3268.23s]  Yeah.
[3268.23s -> 3279.05s]  I'm a furry and I hated that.
[3279.05s -> 3280.05s]  I didn't.
[3280.05s -> 3281.05s]  I just went in.
[3281.05s -> 3282.05s]  I just, it was all right.
[3282.05s -> 3284.05s]  I just put on a spiral dragon caught in uniform.
[3284.05s -> 3289.38s]  All right.
[3289.38s -> 3291.46s]  Survive.
[3291.46s -> 3293.46s]  Why is the rec room still open?
[3293.46s -> 3296.81s]  That was weird.
[3296.81s -> 3304.06s]  So how self-explanatory is it to get in a room?
[3304.06s -> 3306.26s]  I don't know.
[3306.26s -> 3309.26s]  It like starts you in this really weird room.
[3309.26s -> 3311.26s]  I'm going to change my name.
[3311.26s -> 3316.26s]  So we're going to, we're doing a, this is a co-op zombie survival game.
[3316.26s -> 3323.02s]  It has like an H1Z1 title that I can't even put it into this.
[3323.02s -> 3324.02s]  Yeah.
[3324.02s -> 3327.06s]  There we go.
[3327.06s -> 3331.70s]  It's H1Z1 with like an extra S and a U.
[3331.70s -> 3332.70s]  Oh God.
[3332.70s -> 3333.70s]  I'm in.
[3333.70s -> 3344.62s]  That was sudden.
[3344.62s -> 3345.62s]  Going back in.
[3345.62s -> 3351.86s]  Okay.
[3352.86s -> 3359.46s]  I exited rec room and like 300 people came back.
[3359.46s -> 3360.46s]  It's fun.
[3360.46s -> 3361.46s]  Come on.
[3361.46s -> 3363.86s]  It was a fun experience.
[3363.86s -> 3374.16s]  Going back in.
[3374.16s -> 3376.16s]  This game just jumps out at you.
[3376.16s -> 3378.42s]  You said?
[3378.42s -> 3380.42s]  It gives you some, you're in a room.
[3380.42s -> 3383.42s]  It gives you some options for like how you want to turn and move.
[3383.42s -> 3385.42s]  I would go through it real quick.
[3385.42s -> 3388.42s]  And as soon as you're done, like throws you to a main menu.
[3388.42s -> 3390.05s]  Okay.
[3390.05s -> 3392.05s]  But I don't see how to join each other.
[3392.05s -> 3394.05s]  So I'm looking around.
[3394.05s -> 3397.05s]  You can figure it out while I stuff my face in here.
[3397.05s -> 3407.58s]  Oh, you have to beat the tutorial for co-op.
[3407.58s -> 3408.58s]  God damn it.
[3408.58s -> 3411.58s]  I got like face grease all over the shit already.
[3411.58s -> 3412.58s]  Come on.
[3412.58s -> 3426.18s]  Hold on.
[3426.18s -> 3427.18s]  All right.
[3427.18s -> 3428.18s]  It's only been like fucking 30 minutes.
[3428.18s -> 3430.06s]  How long has it been?
[3430.06s -> 3431.06s]  Has it been longer than that?
[3431.06s -> 3436.50s]  How fucking long have I been screaming?
[3436.50s -> 3438.44s]  Holy shit.
[3438.44s -> 3440.44s]  It's been more than an hour.
[3440.44s -> 3441.44s]  Never mind.
[3441.44s -> 3447.80s]  That's better.
[3447.80s -> 3449.62s]  All right.
[3449.62s -> 3450.62s]  Welcome to survive.
[3450.62s -> 3457.68s]  All right.
[3457.68s -> 3461.82s]  For the best play experience you're supposed to answer, how do I walk?
[3461.82s -> 3463.82s]  What the fuck is happening?
[3463.82s -> 3466.31s]  Do I have a glue man shirt on?
[3466.31s -> 3469.38s]  For the best play you're supposed to answer a few questions.
[3469.38s -> 3473.38s]  You can freely update all options later as well as play this wizard again.
[3473.38s -> 3474.38s]  The game has many other options.
[3474.38s -> 3477.38s]  You use the sign in main.
[3477.38s -> 3487.65s]  Okay.
[3487.65s -> 3489.85s]  Use your finger.
[3489.85s -> 3492.85s]  To start tiered with touch here with your finger.
[3492.85s -> 3496.39s]  How tall are you?
[3496.39s -> 3500.39s]  We've automatically set your height, but this will work only if your VR device is correctly set up.
[3500.39s -> 3503.39s]  Feel free to override it manually.
[3503.39s -> 3519.10s]  This looks right.
[3519.10s -> 3520.10s]  This looks correct.
[3520.10s -> 3521.40s]  Okay.
[3521.40s -> 3522.40s]  That's good.
[3522.40s -> 3525.37s]  Who are you?
[3525.37s -> 3526.37s]  Who did you pick?
[3526.37s -> 3528.44s]  Steve.
[3528.44s -> 3529.44s]  Okay.
[3529.44s -> 3530.44s]  You picked Steve.
[3530.44s -> 3536.14s]  I want to be Steve too though.
[3536.14s -> 3537.63s]  I'll be Jason.
[3537.63s -> 3540.64s]  Do you want to see your body?
[3540.64s -> 3543.64s]  This will not influence how other players will see you.
[3543.64s -> 3544.64s]  No.
[3544.64s -> 3545.64s]  I like it.
[3545.64s -> 3546.64s]  I like seeing me.
[3546.64s -> 3553.15s]  I think that's fine.
[3553.15s -> 3556.15s]  How do you like to choose pad and stick?
[3556.15s -> 3559.46s]  What the fuck is going on there?
[3559.46s -> 3560.46s]  Arm swing.
[3560.46s -> 3568.84s]  Are they going to do arm swing?
[3568.84s -> 3579.45s]  How do you like to turn?
[3579.45s -> 3582.39s]  What is HMD?
[3582.39s -> 3583.39s]  I have no idea.
[3583.39s -> 3585.39s]  I set mine to snap.
[3585.39s -> 3588.27s]  Snap turn?
[3588.27s -> 3591.27s]  Yeah, so when you thumb stick it just snaps you.
[3591.27s -> 3592.27s]  Guns volume.
[3592.27s -> 3594.27s]  I'm going to turn guns volume on normal.
[3594.27s -> 3596.27s]  And there's only normal and realistic.
[3596.27s -> 3597.27s]  What does that mean?
[3597.27s -> 3598.27s]  Is it louder on realistic?
[3598.27s -> 3600.27s]  Realistic is very loud.
[3600.27s -> 3601.27s]  Would recommend.
[3601.27s -> 3603.27s]  This is not an arcade game.
[3603.27s -> 3605.27s]  You want me to peek my microphone?
[3605.27s -> 3610.67s]  Why do you want me to peek my microphone?
[3610.67s -> 3613.67s]  I want you to peek your microphone with realistic guns now.
[3613.67s -> 3614.67s]  No checkpoints for nightmare.
[3614.67s -> 3615.67s]  Okay, what are we doing?
[3615.67s -> 3620.30s]  Survivor or no future?
[3620.30s -> 3623.30s]  Sissy, can I play daddy?
[3623.30s -> 3625.30s]  How about just survivor?
[3625.30s -> 3627.24s]  Okay.
[3627.24s -> 3634.13s]  Story mode starts at chapter zero prologue.
[3634.13s -> 3641.08s]  It's a real tutorial.
[3641.08s -> 3644.28s]  Okay, so we just have to...
[3644.28s -> 3649.46s]  Alright, story.
[3649.46s -> 3651.46s]  And then story will give you a tutorial you have to do.
[3651.46s -> 3652.46s]  And I'll wait for you at the end.
[3652.46s -> 3653.46s]  Okay.
[3653.46s -> 3663.79s]  Can you guys hear this?
[3663.79s -> 3681.01s]  Infection day 47, chapter zero prologue tutorial.
[3681.01s -> 3683.01s]  Oh, I walk.
[3683.01s -> 3688.26s]  Alright, that didn't seem correct.
[3688.26s -> 3696.34s]  Okay, okay.
[3696.34s -> 3698.34s]  Whoa, wait a minute.
[3698.34s -> 3702.40s]  Why is this happening?
[3702.40s -> 3709.06s]  Why is it doing this?
[3709.06s -> 3712.83s]  Why am I doing this?
[3712.83s -> 3714.83s]  Arm swing.
[3714.83s -> 3718.12s]  Stop moving.
[3718.12s -> 3719.12s]  How do I stop?
[3719.12s -> 3730.82s]  Okay, there's a zombie right there.
[3730.82s -> 3731.82s]  I hate this.
[3731.82s -> 3732.82s]  I hate this.
[3732.82s -> 3733.82s]  How do I...
[3733.82s -> 3735.82s]  Wait for the button to go to the menu.
[3751.84s -> 3756.94s]  Press trackpad in any direction to sprint.
[3756.94s -> 3761.80s]  Something's not right here.
[3761.80s -> 3766.88s]  Okay.
[3766.88s -> 3769.88s]  Press the grip button to grab it.
[3769.88s -> 3771.88s]  It's just moving me around.
[3771.88s -> 3774.85s]  Okay.
[3774.85s -> 3778.66s]  Healing spray is limited so use it carefully.
[3778.66s -> 3781.03s]  How do I put it away?
[3781.03s -> 3785.98s]  You have bags on your waist.
[3785.98s -> 3793.63s]  You can put them in the right one.
[3793.63s -> 3796.96s]  Did it tell you how to do that?
[3796.96s -> 3798.33s]  No.
[3798.33s -> 3799.33s]  It tells you later.
[3799.33s -> 3800.33s]  Why?
[3800.33s -> 3801.33s]  What?
[3801.33s -> 3803.33s]  Just go with the tutorial.
[3803.33s -> 3806.33s]  Stop strutting out about this apocalypse.
[3806.33s -> 3810.06s]  I have to change the controls.
[3810.06s -> 3811.06s]  These are terrible.
[3811.06s -> 3813.37s]  Why do I think this is a good idea?
[3813.37s -> 3824.53s]  Are you lefty?
[3824.53s -> 3829.53s]  Press and hold menu button to change trackpad between locomotion or action mode.
[3829.53s -> 3834.78s]  Okay, that's better.
[3834.78s -> 3835.78s]  Not really though.
[3835.78s -> 3838.66s]  Freaking arm swing.
[3838.66s -> 3845.54s]  Duck to get through.
[3845.54s -> 3847.54s]  Center, press left touchpad.
[3847.54s -> 3851.77s]  This is so fucked up right now.
[3851.77s -> 3856.07s]  Like every time I move any direction.
[3856.07s -> 3861.14s]  Press left touchpad playing in seated position.
[3861.14s -> 3863.14s]  I'm not in a seated position.
[3863.14s -> 3866.28s]  How do I fucking move?
[3866.28s -> 3868.28s]  I should have just done god damn teleport.
[3868.28s -> 3878.84s]  Okay, trigger button to grab.
[3878.84s -> 3881.66s]  Oh my god.
[3881.66s -> 3883.66s]  Stop moving.
[3883.66s -> 3888.20s]  Grab a magazine.
[3888.20s -> 3892.77s]  Yeah.
[3892.77s -> 3911.35s]  Don't move.
[3911.35s -> 3922.87s]  How do I release this?
[3926.29s -> 3933.28s]  How do you get rid of the magazine?
[3933.28s -> 3937.90s]  You press E or one of the buttons on your hand.
[3937.90s -> 3941.09s]  I didn't fucking tell you that.
[3941.09s -> 3968.67s]  Under barrel flashlight, touch under barrel flashlight.
[3968.67s -> 3974.00s]  I cannot wait to go to a menu and turn the shit off.
[3974.00s -> 3977.00s]  Even aiming my gun is making me walk.
[3977.00s -> 3991.55s]  Yeah.
[3991.55s -> 4007.43s]  Alright, not bad.
[4007.43s -> 4010.80s]  Press down on the trackpad.
[4010.80s -> 4019.27s]  Down.
[4019.27s -> 4020.27s]  Probably almost done here.
[4020.27s -> 4023.02s]  It's actually a lot longer.
[4023.02s -> 4025.02s]  Is it longer?
[4025.02s -> 4027.02s]  Like I don't know when this ends still.
[4027.02s -> 4029.02s]  Oh god, you're still in it?
[4029.02s -> 4030.02s]  Yeah.
[4030.02s -> 4034.25s]  Put objects in your backpack?
[4034.25s -> 4040.14s]  No, not yet.
[4040.14s -> 4041.14s]  Not yet.
[4041.14s -> 4044.72s]  Okay, you just gotta throw it behind you.
[4044.72s -> 4050.86s]  Can I have three objects?
[4050.86s -> 4053.17s]  That's in my backpack right now.
[4053.17s -> 4054.17s]  It's not.
[4054.17s -> 4059.29s]  That's how you know.
[4059.29s -> 4060.29s]  Okay.
[4060.29s -> 4066.71s]  Oh man.
[4066.71s -> 4071.32s]  No, I'm trying to.
[4071.32s -> 4073.07s]  Fuck.
[4073.07s -> 4076.21s]  How can I tell what's in my backpack?
[4076.21s -> 4081.20s]  Can I get in my backpack?
[4081.20s -> 4083.20s]  I just took the bullets out.
[4083.20s -> 4088.88s]  What was I thinking doing this?
[4088.88s -> 4091.88s]  I have no idea how to get into your backpack.
[4091.88s -> 4094.18s]  Sidearms and weapons and...
[4094.18s -> 4103.62s]  What?
[4103.62s -> 4112.62s]  Okay, you can keep it in three magazines in your belt.
[4112.62s -> 4118.34s]  This guy...
[4118.34s -> 4123.90s]  Did that go in my belt?
[4123.90s -> 4129.90s]  I think so, yeah.
[4129.90s -> 4138.18s]  I don't know if this is the tutorial or the whole game.
[4138.18s -> 4141.18s]  Didn't it say once we get to the end of the tutorial we can play together?
[4141.18s -> 4143.18s]  I know, but this feels unreasonably long.
[4143.18s -> 4145.18s]  Fight together, that's what it says.
[4145.18s -> 4159.60s]  Are you sure?
[4159.60s -> 4163.38s]  Vive inside.
[4163.38s -> 4168.69s]  This looks like a safe house.
[4175.54s -> 4177.54s]  Press grip to grab the drill.
[4178.54s -> 4179.54s]  Okay.
[4179.54s -> 4181.54s]  What the fuck?
[4187.54s -> 4194.02s]  Okay, this has...
[4194.02s -> 4195.02s]  No, this is definitely it.
[4195.02s -> 4196.02s]  Speak, friend, and enter.
[4196.02s -> 4197.02s]  This is it.
[4197.02s -> 4198.58s]  Right?
[4198.58s -> 4199.58s]  It has to be.
[4200.58s -> 4201.58s]  Fight together.
[4201.58s -> 4203.58s]  How do I invite you?
[4206.27s -> 4207.27s]  I don't know.
[4207.27s -> 4210.02s]  I assumed that was still in the tutorial.
[4210.02s -> 4211.02s]  Is it...
[4214.33s -> 4215.33s]  Is it like a start menu?
[4215.33s -> 4217.33s]  No, it is not.
[4218.33s -> 4220.33s]  Does anybody know...
[4220.33s -> 4222.33s]  how to...
[4224.33s -> 4225.33s]  I've got to get back to the controls.
[4225.33s -> 4227.33s]  Anybody have any idea?
[4232.33s -> 4233.33s]  I can't smash the TV.
[4233.33s -> 4235.33s]  Zero out of ten.
[4237.33s -> 4239.33s]  Arms up to enter the menu.
[4239.33s -> 4241.33s]  What a lie.
[4242.33s -> 4243.89s]  There was a button to skip...
[4243.89s -> 4249.24s]  Hey, there's a button to skip the tutorial at the very beginning.
[4250.24s -> 4252.24s]  You want to just reload and press the button?
[4252.24s -> 4254.24s]  I think I'm probably at the end.
[4259.24s -> 4261.24s]  You can skip and I can explain anything.
[4261.24s -> 4263.24s]  I don't know how to leave the game though.
[4263.24s -> 4265.24s]  It's always Alt-F4, easy.
[4269.24s -> 4271.24s]  I have to turn this shit off.
[4271.24s -> 4273.48s]  I'm just fucking going to quit the game.
[4277.48s -> 4279.48s]  This actually is a text-to-speech voice.
[4279.48s -> 4281.48s]  I'm just going to fucking sprint.
[4281.48s -> 4282.48s]  Zen's outside.
[4282.48s -> 4283.48s]  Shoot the lock to continue.
[4283.48s -> 4284.48s]  Let's go.
[4284.48s -> 4285.48s]  Come on.
[4285.48s -> 4286.48s]  Just go.
[4286.48s -> 4288.48s]  You can keep two melee on your side.
[4288.48s -> 4296.86s]  This seems like fun.
[4296.86s -> 4297.86s]  It's a checkpoint.
[4297.86s -> 4299.86s]  Oh man, come on.
[4299.86s -> 4306.78s]  How do I open the door?
[4306.78s -> 4307.78s]  What if I drill?
[4307.78s -> 4317.74s]  Open it to unlock a...
[4317.74s -> 4318.74s]  Got it.
[4318.74s -> 4325.94s]  It worked.
[4325.94s -> 4330.89s]  All right, Cole.
[4330.89s -> 4332.89s]  Do you see how fucking odd this is?
[4332.89s -> 4333.89s]  No.
[4333.89s -> 4349.66s]  It's so fucking throw-up inducing.
[4349.66s -> 4364.59s]  I'm going to keep complaining about it over and over again.
[4364.59s -> 4367.79s]  It's my stupid brain.
[4367.79s -> 4372.18s]  I'm going to keep complaining about it over and over again.
[4372.18s -> 4375.18s]  I'm going to keep complaining about it over and over again.
[4375.18s -> 4378.42s]  It's my stupid brain that decided to do it.
[4378.42s -> 4380.50s]  What decided to do it?
[4380.50s -> 4383.50s]  I just hit my fucking face on the car door.
[4391.97s -> 4392.97s]  What is this?
[4392.97s -> 4394.97s]  What's this like popsicle bag?
[4394.97s -> 4400.18s]  Okay.
[4400.18s -> 4403.18s]  I mean, I've gotten to a second safe house now.
[4403.18s -> 4406.48s]  I'm just going to skip the tutorial and see where I am.
[4408.36s -> 4411.90s]  Turn the gun on yourself.
[4411.90s -> 4412.90s]  Turn the gun on yourself.
[4412.90s -> 4419.20s]  Oh, fuck.
[4419.20s -> 4421.20s]  This is a checkpoint.
[4421.20s -> 4445.97s]  I have to complete it.
[4445.97s -> 4447.97s]  I think we have to complete this, dude.
[4447.97s -> 4450.46s]  Oh, I just quit.
[4450.46s -> 4451.46s]  Press the...
[4451.46s -> 4459.23s]  Can I just like...
[4459.23s -> 4461.24s]  Oh, look.
[4461.24s -> 4464.24s]  Star is now playing survive.
[4464.24s -> 4468.27s]  You need to run.
[4468.27s -> 4471.11s]  All right.
[4471.11s -> 4472.11s]  Let's...
[4472.11s -> 4478.28s]  Damn it.
[4478.28s -> 4481.50s]  I have to like exit.
[4481.50s -> 4483.50s]  Do I actually have to go home?
[4483.50s -> 4486.70s]  He's mad.
[4486.70s -> 4491.26s]  Why can't it just be like some kind of start menu?
[4491.26s -> 4496.32s]  Don't you have like a...
[4496.32s -> 4500.62s]  VR button to open up that menu and close it?
[4500.62s -> 4501.80s]  Where is it?
[4501.80s -> 4506.86s]  Screen savers?
[4506.86s -> 4507.86s]  What?
[4507.86s -> 4509.86s]  No, these are Steam friends.
[4509.86s -> 4510.86s]  There it is.
[4510.86s -> 4511.86s]  Okay, let's go.
[4511.86s -> 4513.86s]  Oh, no.
[4513.86s -> 4516.67s]  Skip the tutorial.
[4516.67s -> 4517.67s]  I can't.
[4517.67s -> 4518.67s]  What do you mean you can't?
[4518.67s -> 4520.67s]  Because I reached checkpoints and it saved my game,
[4520.67s -> 4522.67s]  so it didn't start me at the beginning.
[4522.67s -> 4526.55s]  I clicked story and it just started me back where I was.
[4526.55s -> 4530.88s]  Is it like a new profile?
[4530.88s -> 4535.34s]  But thank God I can at least turn this shit off.
[4535.34s -> 4539.69s]  For the love of God.
[4539.69s -> 4545.73s]  Read what that says.
[4545.73s -> 4548.29s]  Can anybody fucking read this?
[4548.29s -> 4553.66s]  Wait a minute.
[4553.66s -> 4555.66s]  How close am I to something?
[4555.66s -> 4565.29s]  Pad and stick.
[4565.29s -> 4569.26s]  Standing...
[4569.26s -> 4579.30s]  So you're telling me that we can't...
[4579.30s -> 4582.50s]  Are you sure?
[4582.50s -> 4584.58s]  Players.
[4584.58s -> 4586.58s]  Two player.
[4586.58s -> 4606.98s]  And teleport.
[4606.98s -> 4611.85s]  So are you...
[4611.85s -> 4613.85s]  Do we actually have to do this anyway?
[4613.85s -> 4617.88s]  This is disappointing.
[4617.88s -> 4618.88s]  Wait a minute.
[4618.88s -> 4628.10s]  I can skip the tutorial.
[4628.10s -> 4629.40s]  How?
[4629.40s -> 4630.40s]  I just had to start...
[4630.40s -> 4632.40s]  I just started it over again.
[4632.40s -> 4633.40s]  Never mind.
[4633.40s -> 4635.83s]  It's a lie.
[4635.83s -> 4640.90s]  Uh-huh.
[4640.90s -> 4643.90s]  Why is this...
[4643.90s -> 4646.90s]  Why is this still doing this?
[4646.90s -> 4652.90s]  I did teleport.
[4652.90s -> 4655.46s]  I didn't save the settings?
[4655.46s -> 4656.46s]  What?
[4656.46s -> 4657.46s]  I thought I...
[4657.46s -> 4666.45s]  Ah!
[4666.45s -> 4670.44s]  Are you sure?
[4670.44s -> 4673.44s]  I thought I hit save settings like twice.
[4673.44s -> 4676.77s]  Oh fucking God.
[4676.77s -> 4684.12s]  Give me a break.
[4684.12s -> 4687.58s]  Are you sure I didn't hit save settings?
[4687.58s -> 4705.52s]  Hello?
[4705.52s -> 4721.90s]  Just add a start menu.
[4721.90s -> 4726.85s]  Like hold this button down for like three seconds for something.
[4726.85s -> 4729.09s]  That's like, come on.
[4729.09s -> 4732.54s]  What the heck?
[4732.54s -> 4734.54s]  Do I have to quit the game to go to the menu?
[4734.54s -> 4742.44s]  Or am I insane?
[4742.44s -> 4755.22s]  I can save settings.
[4755.22s -> 4756.22s]  Two player co-op.
[4756.22s -> 4767.53s]  Teleport.
[4767.53s -> 4769.53s]  Are you still in the room with me?
[4769.53s -> 4771.41s]  What?
[4771.41s -> 4773.41s]  There is a start menu.
[4773.41s -> 4774.41s]  How did I get to it?
[4774.41s -> 4792.34s]  So apparently we hit a tablet at the end of the tutorial to like have a menu.
[4792.34s -> 4794.34s]  Are you still doing the tutorial?
[4794.34s -> 4800.48s]  I can't figure out anything else to do so I'm doing it.
[4800.48s -> 4802.91s]  I'm just running through.
[4802.91s -> 4816.37s]  If only we knew we should just press the fucking goddamn big red button.
[4816.37s -> 4822.37s]  I don't know what's going to be in the story when the tutorial is showing you every feature in the game.
[4822.37s -> 4823.37s]  God fucking damn it.
[4823.37s -> 4828.99s]  I'm going to scream.
[4828.99s -> 4832.74s]  How am I supposed to reliably just teleport?
[4832.74s -> 4844.83s]  And this is even worse.
[4844.83s -> 4859.47s]  Where did my gun go?
[4859.47s -> 4861.47s]  I get that.
[4861.47s -> 4867.78s]  I guess I'm full over here.
[4867.78s -> 4877.71s]  I don't have a gun to shoot this.
[4877.71s -> 4878.71s]  Do I have a gun?
[4878.71s -> 4882.08s]  Where's my gun?
[4882.08s -> 4898.43s]  I can't go through there without a gun.
[4898.43s -> 4907.83s]  Get me out of this fucking room.
[4907.83s -> 4910.52s]  Why didn't I...
[4910.52s -> 4911.52s]  I went down here.
[4911.52s -> 4918.88s]  Oh my god.
[4918.88s -> 4919.88s]  Get me the fuck out of here.
[4919.88s -> 4927.94s]  You don't seem too good.
[4927.94s -> 4936.64s]  Oh my god.
[4936.64s -> 4940.12s]  Okay, just give me an axe.
[4940.12s -> 4942.12s]  I'm fucking going as fast as I can.
[4942.12s -> 4947.94s]  Is there anything over here?
[4947.94s -> 4953.77s]  Do I not hold this with two hands?
[4953.77s -> 4975.62s]  Hey, I made it.
[4975.62s -> 4984.64s]  Does it matter which way I go here?
[4984.64s -> 4993.39s]  Probably not.
[4993.39s -> 4994.39s]  It's fun.
[4994.39s -> 5006.09s]  It's not a sidearm.
[5006.09s -> 5017.74s]  Okay, alright.
[5017.74s -> 5019.74s]  You'll be done in about an hour.
[5019.74s -> 5021.74s]  No.
[5021.74s -> 5024.90s]  I'm still going.
[5024.90s -> 5026.90s]  Are you still in the story?
[5026.90s -> 5027.90s]  Yeah.
[5027.90s -> 5031.99s]  Why didn't we just press the button?
[5031.99s -> 5034.99s]  I'm hoping that when I get to the end I can end what you were saying.
[5034.99s -> 5035.99s]  I hope so.
[5035.99s -> 5051.86s]  What's going on here?
[5054.77s -> 5055.77s]  This guy's as a zombie.
[5055.77s -> 5059.07s]  You can like dump goo all over yourself.
[5059.07s -> 5067.10s]  Grab the stew, okay?
[5067.10s -> 5070.10s]  Zombies do not attack you, but stay away from them.
[5070.10s -> 5072.10s]  Don't use any gun or object.
[5072.10s -> 5073.10s]  Be quiet.
[5073.10s -> 5078.33s]  Press C.
[5078.33s -> 5080.27s]  Ah!
[5080.27s -> 5081.27s]  I pressed it!
[5081.27s -> 5082.27s]  I pressed the button!
[5082.27s -> 5113.66s]  I think that skipped the tutorial.
[5113.66s -> 5123.68s]  I need that flashlight.
[5123.68s -> 5124.68s]  Where's the flashlight?
[5124.68s -> 5127.50s]  I had one before.
[5127.50s -> 5130.50s]  If only we just pressed the fucking red button.
[5130.50s -> 5133.70s]  I think I'm at the end.
[5133.70s -> 5134.70s]  Oh, thank God.
[5134.70s -> 5135.70s]  Please invite me.
[5135.70s -> 5137.70s]  Get me out of this hell.
[5137.70s -> 5145.03s]  I've got tablets and walkie talkies.
[5145.03s -> 5146.03s]  Please.
[5146.03s -> 5148.03s]  Roger that.
[5148.03s -> 5158.91s]  Is this how I'm supposed to open this door?
[5158.91s -> 5167.28s]  I did it!
[5167.28s -> 5173.58s]  Oh no.
[5173.58s -> 5175.90s]  Why are you oh noing?
[5175.90s -> 5176.90s]  Don't oh no right now.
[5176.90s -> 5177.90s]  That's not what we need.
[5177.90s -> 5179.90s]  We don't need an oh no.
[5179.90s -> 5182.21s]  We need like an oh yes.
[5182.21s -> 5186.50s]  I think this is part two of the tutorial.
[5186.50s -> 5187.50s]  No, it's not.
[5187.50s -> 5191.89s]  I mean, it still said chapter zero.
[5191.89s -> 5194.41s]  I couldn't open that before.
[5194.41s -> 5195.41s]  Why?
[5195.41s -> 5199.62s]  Honest to God, what is going on?
[5199.62s -> 5200.62s]  It's teleport.
[5200.62s -> 5206.69s]  I'm like, I have like a whip in my hand.
[5206.69s -> 5214.18s]  I can't go further?
[5214.18s -> 5217.32s]  A water bender over here.
[5217.32s -> 5218.32s]  Okay.
[5218.32s -> 5219.32s]  Figure it out.
[5219.32s -> 5220.32s]  No.
[5220.32s -> 5221.32s]  What is in my backpack right now?
[5221.32s -> 5253.20s]  The spray is really loud.
[5253.20s -> 5288.86s]  The hold a button.
[5288.86s -> 5292.86s]  So I have, I don't want this shit in there.
[5292.86s -> 5293.86s]  Get that out of here.
[5293.86s -> 5294.86s]  Give me this.
[5294.86s -> 5307.62s]  I don't care.
[5307.62s -> 5308.62s]  Let's just go.
[5308.62s -> 5310.62s]  We need to get to the, so we can play.
[5310.62s -> 5317.94s]  The whole point is this is a co-op video game to play together.
[5317.94s -> 5319.94s]  So you're not out of the tutorial.
[5319.94s -> 5325.93s]  I'm, I think I'm getting the tutorial to when the game isn't a tutorial.
[5325.93s -> 5335.06s]  They gave me the tablet and it has like find a game on it, but it's grayed out.
[5335.06s -> 5337.06s]  I don't know how I would invite you.
[5337.06s -> 5345.62s]  At this point, it would probably actually be faster if we like uninstalled the game and then reinstalled the game and then skip the story.
[5345.62s -> 5350.62s]  Oh, all I know is I'm, I'm feeling sick like having to walk here.
[5350.62s -> 5353.62s]  No, no.
[5353.62s -> 5362.45s]  That didn't go in my holster.
[5362.45s -> 5364.45s]  This is a, this is a monster in here.
[5364.45s -> 5366.45s]  I need to drill.
[5366.45s -> 5372.03s]  Do a drill.
[5372.03s -> 5374.46s]  Is there a gun in here?
[5374.46s -> 5377.11s]  I can't open that.
[5377.11s -> 5396.10s]  Oh, this is cool.
[5396.10s -> 5398.10s]  Go in here.
[5398.10s -> 5411.16s]  Why do I have one of these?
[5411.16s -> 5413.17s]  Okay.
[5413.17s -> 5417.42s]  Give me the, give me this.
[5417.42s -> 5479.30s]  I'm turning into the zombie.
[5479.30s -> 5483.34s]  Is something going on here?
[5483.34s -> 5484.34s]  Where am I in my room?
[5484.34s -> 5487.34s]  Am I like, did I like punch a hole in the wall?
[5487.34s -> 5488.64s]  Why?
[5488.64s -> 5491.84s]  Change fire mode.
[5491.84s -> 5495.66s]  He just won't stop talking and telling me what to do.
[5495.66s -> 5500.34s]  But he won't tell me what I really want to know, which is how to be friends.
[5500.34s -> 5508.54s]  What is going on right now?
[5508.54s -> 5514.81s]  That's bad.
[5514.81s -> 5521.76s]  This is like good game mechanics too.
[5521.76s -> 5528.29s]  Like losing the track on the ground.
[5528.29s -> 5532.23s]  Three magazines in your belt pouches.
[5532.23s -> 5534.23s]  So you get the front pouches.
[5534.23s -> 5555.62s]  So what do you want to do about this?
[5555.62s -> 5557.62s]  One of the other games we have.
[5557.62s -> 5562.62s]  Do you want to keep playing in a tutorial until we can play with each other?
[5562.62s -> 5568.73s]  What is that sound?
[5568.73s -> 5571.73s]  Why is there somebody washing dishes?
[5571.73s -> 5581.35s]  I'm going to throw up.
[5581.35s -> 5584.74s]  Ah, shit.
[5584.74s -> 5588.82s]  Somebody hit the zombie with a shopping cart?
[5588.82s -> 5589.82s]  Oh, okay.
[5589.82s -> 5599.27s]  What are you doing?
[5599.27s -> 5611.65s]  God damn it.
[5611.65s -> 5615.65s]  Alright, it might be time to make an executive decision and do something else.
[5615.65s -> 5617.91s]  Bye.
[5617.91s -> 5619.15s]  One second.
[5619.15s -> 5625.46s]  If this is not the end of the tutorial.
[5625.46s -> 5626.46s]  Chapter one!
[5626.46s -> 5629.28s]  I'm so far behind you though.
[5629.28s -> 5630.28s]  Tell me, like guide me.
[5630.28s -> 5631.28s]  Okay, I just got to be so far.
[5631.28s -> 5633.28s]  I'll just see if I can invite you.
[5633.28s -> 5636.28s]  Trust me, you're not going to catch up anytime soon.
[5636.28s -> 5647.54s]  I'm trying to go as fast as I can.
[5647.54s -> 5648.91s]  Numbers, numbers, numbers.
[5648.91s -> 5651.91s]  What? Is that you?
[5651.91s -> 5654.98s]  This is an all frequency message.
[5654.98s -> 5655.98s]  Are you contacting me?
[5655.98s -> 5656.98s]  My name is Jeremy Stan.
[5656.98s -> 5658.98s]  Are you writing this?
[5658.98s -> 5661.42s]  You're almost at the end.
[5661.42s -> 5663.42s]  You need to beat this.
[5663.42s -> 5667.42s]  This is the only way you get the join session on your story mode.
[5667.42s -> 5669.42s]  I'm limited by the teleport.
[5669.42s -> 5672.42s]  If you want to keep going, I'm sitting on the ground and I'm going to wait for you.
[5672.42s -> 5673.42s]  Okay, I'm going.
[5673.42s -> 5674.42s]  I'm going.
[5674.42s -> 5675.42s]  I'm going.
[5675.42s -> 5681.50s]  So you tell me I just got the assault rifle?
[5681.50s -> 5694.29s]  You have to kill like a giant group of things and you might get past this military base and you're done.
[5694.29s -> 5698.83s]  Did I walk by something?
[5698.83s -> 5708.58s]  Yeah.
[5708.58s -> 5714.70s]  Someone in President's sleep was in chat.
[5714.70s -> 5716.70s]  I'm sorry.
[5716.70s -> 5718.70s]  We didn't know this was going to happen.
[5718.70s -> 5719.70s]  Just wake up.
[5719.70s -> 5723.78s]  Just wait until we play Desert Bus.
[5723.78s -> 5729.08s]  Save your resident sleepers for Desert Bus.
[5729.08s -> 5734.52s]  Okay, I made it through another room.
[5734.52s -> 5735.52s]  Is it a drill?
[5735.52s -> 5737.82s]  Skip that room.
[5737.82s -> 5739.82s]  Skip this room.
[5739.82s -> 5741.82s]  It's like a safe house, right?
[5741.82s -> 5742.82s]  Is it?
[5742.82s -> 5743.82s]  I don't know.
[5743.82s -> 5747.09s]  Is this like the army wants you or something?
[5747.09s -> 5749.52s]  You want the army guy.
[5749.52s -> 5758.37s]  Are you sure I don't go in this house with a big red door?
[5758.37s -> 5766.20s]  I guess.
[5767.20s -> 5770.66s]  No.
[5770.66s -> 5790.51s]  I need a drill.
[5790.51s -> 5796.59s]  I got the radio.
[5796.59s -> 5801.95s]  Hello.
[5801.95s -> 5804.95s]  Okay, you just have to follow the instructions.
[5804.95s -> 5806.95s]  Don't get distracted.
[5806.95s -> 5809.95s]  And as soon as you finish everything.
[5809.95s -> 5811.95s]  What do you mean as soon as I finish everything?
[5811.95s -> 5815.95s]  You go into a whole other room with a bunch of guns and he gives you like tutorial number two.
[5815.95s -> 5817.95s]  I thought you said I was done.
[5817.95s -> 5818.95s]  And then you're done.
[5818.95s -> 5820.95s]  I thought you said I was done.
[5820.95s -> 5822.95s]  Just follow instructions.
[5827.14s -> 5829.14s]  And then we could play for like 10 minutes.
[5829.14s -> 5835.50s]  Mom's calling me for supper.
[5835.50s -> 5838.50s]  Put the radio on the left shoulder of your backpack.
[5855.97s -> 5856.97s]  It's right there.
[5856.97s -> 5858.97s]  It's right there.
[5858.97s -> 5861.66s]  Put it on your back.
[5861.66s -> 5862.66s]  Wait, what?
[5862.66s -> 5868.66s]  What is I'm going to put this like fucking scholastic tablet in my pants on your butt?
[5888.24s -> 5904.30s]  Thank you.
[5904.30s -> 5911.65s]  Weapons.
[5912.65s -> 5917.55s]  I got something to say.
[5917.55s -> 5923.55s]  Why not just have this room have all the like tutorials in it?
[5923.55s -> 5925.55s]  And it's like you can play around.
[5925.55s -> 5927.55s]  Make sure you figure out how you understand how the game works.
[5927.55s -> 5928.55s]  I don't know, man.
[5928.55s -> 5931.30s]  Because this is tutorial room two.
[5931.30s -> 5934.30s]  Why don't I have like a bigger tutorial room zero here?
[5934.30s -> 5937.63s]  I don't know, man.
[5937.63s -> 5956.92s]  You lied to me.
[5956.92s -> 5958.92s]  You said I was done.
[5970.74s -> 5974.74s]  I'm begging you to play something else.
[5974.74s -> 5977.96s]  No, guys.
[5977.96s -> 5978.96s]  Give it a chance.
[5978.96s -> 5979.96s]  Just wait.
[5979.96s -> 5980.96s]  Just give it a chance.
[5980.96s -> 5982.78s]  We've put in so much time.
[5982.78s -> 5984.78s]  We're almost there.
[5984.78s -> 5989.73s]  Got it.
[5989.73s -> 6003.94s]  Do you know how to do it now?
[6003.94s -> 6004.94s]  I can't.
[6004.94s -> 6005.94s]  It's fine.
[6005.94s -> 6010.99s]  You should be able to carry also smaller ones.
[6010.99s -> 6015.47s]  Didn't we already do this?
[6015.47s -> 6018.47s]  This feels like what should have been the tutorial.
[6018.47s -> 6019.47s]  I'm confused.
[6019.47s -> 6033.42s]  Testfully complete course to become a thought-becoming mother figure.
[6033.42s -> 6044.12s]  407 days later, that's what it feels like.
[6044.12s -> 6045.12s]  Yeah.
[6045.12s -> 6049.34s]  Chapter one.
[6049.34s -> 6050.34s]  Bad Satan.
[6050.34s -> 6051.34s]  There you go.
[6051.34s -> 6052.34s]  Can we do it?
[6052.34s -> 6058.74s]  On your tablet, you should have a find a game.
[6058.74s -> 6059.92s]  Find a game.
[6059.92s -> 6064.31s]  Search for an available session or join a random session.
[6064.31s -> 6065.31s]  Refresh.
[6065.31s -> 6073.40s]  Got it.
[6073.40s -> 6091.28s]  You did it.
[6091.28s -> 6093.42s]  Just wait.
[6093.42s -> 6094.42s]  Don't say that yet.
[6094.42s -> 6095.42s]  Don't say that.
[6095.42s -> 6097.42s]  Instead of new players, join the game.
[6097.42s -> 6098.72s]  All right.
[6098.72s -> 6102.88s]  Now, how do I change my controls again?
[6102.88s -> 6106.72s]  Oh, I can hear you in game.
[6106.72s -> 6107.72s]  Don't move.
[6107.72s -> 6108.72s]  Don't move.
[6108.72s -> 6110.34s]  No.
[6110.34s -> 6111.34s]  Don't move.
[6111.34s -> 6122.57s]  Don't move.
[6122.57s -> 6123.57s]  Trust me.
[6123.57s -> 6124.57s]  That's fucking terrifying.
[6124.57s -> 6131.12s]  Wow.
[6131.12s -> 6134.06s]  Do you want to come join me?
[6134.06s -> 6135.06s]  Yeah.
[6135.06s -> 6136.06s]  Is there?
[6136.06s -> 6137.62s]  Can I?
[6137.62s -> 6143.28s]  All right.
[6143.28s -> 6144.28s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[6144.28s -> 6145.28s]  You ready to go kill some zombies?
[6145.28s -> 6146.28s]  Not yet.
[6146.28s -> 6147.28s]  Stay there.
[6147.28s -> 6148.28s]  You left.
[6148.28s -> 6149.28s]  Just wait.
[6149.28s -> 6150.28s]  I have to change.
[6150.28s -> 6152.28s]  The teleports make me sick too.
[6152.28s -> 6155.78s]  We're almost there.
[6155.78s -> 6156.78s]  Just another minute.
[6156.78s -> 6157.78s]  Just everybody relax.
[6157.78s -> 6158.78s]  Calm down.
[6158.78s -> 6159.78s]  You've been very patient.
[6159.78s -> 6165.54s]  And I appreciate the fact that probably only 600 or 700 people left.
[6165.54s -> 6166.54s]  Okay.
[6166.54s -> 6172.10s]  I'm doing movement type pad and stick.
[6172.10s -> 6174.10s]  Is that what you have?
[6174.10s -> 6176.10s]  I don't remember.
[6176.10s -> 6179.10s]  Did you pad and stick?
[6179.10s -> 6181.54s]  I think so.
[6181.54s -> 6188.34s]  All right.
[6188.34s -> 6189.34s]  Story.
[6189.34s -> 6193.85s]  Okay.
[6193.85s -> 6194.85s]  Let's go.
[6194.85s -> 6195.85s]  Let's go.
[6195.85s -> 6196.85s]  Let's do it.
[6196.85s -> 6197.85s]  Let's do it.
[6197.85s -> 6198.85s]  Come on.
[6198.85s -> 6199.85s]  Come on.
[6199.85s -> 6200.85s]  Come on.
[6200.85s -> 6201.85s]  Come on.
[6201.85s -> 6202.85s]  Get fucking calm down about this.
[6202.85s -> 6206.58s]  Turn the audio down.
[6206.58s -> 6207.58s]  You got it.
[6207.58s -> 6210.94s]  Okay.
[6210.94s -> 6223.68s]  All right.
[6223.68s -> 6224.68s]  Invite me again.
[6224.68s -> 6225.68s]  No, don't invite me.
[6225.68s -> 6226.68s]  I got you.
[6226.68s -> 6238.10s]  I can't see the viewer count.
[6238.10s -> 6239.10s]  How many people are here?
[6239.10s -> 6240.46s]  I can't see.
[6240.46s -> 6241.46s]  Like 15.
[6241.46s -> 6244.46s]  Did everybody fucking leave?
[6244.46s -> 6251.02s]  Just about to get crunked.
[6251.02s -> 6254.02s]  I am so sorry, guys.
[6254.02s -> 6255.02s]  I'm so sorry.
[6255.02s -> 6256.02s]  That took way too long.
[6256.02s -> 6257.02s]  This game is going to be fun.
[6257.02s -> 6261.50s]  We'll make it up for you in Desert Bus.
[6261.50s -> 6265.50s]  We're going to make it up to you guys when we play Desert Bus.
[6265.50s -> 6268.53s]  Welcome to VR.
[6268.53s -> 6269.53s]  That's right.
[6269.53s -> 6270.53s]  I'm talking to you.
[6270.53s -> 6271.53s]  I know where I am.
[6271.53s -> 6272.53s]  There you are.
[6272.53s -> 6285.10s]  There you are.
[6285.10s -> 6286.10s]  There he is.
[6286.10s -> 6287.10s]  It's me.
[6287.10s -> 6288.10s]  Hey, turn around.
[6288.10s -> 6289.91s]  Look at me.
[6289.91s -> 6290.91s]  What are you doing?
[6290.91s -> 6292.54s]  Let me just do this.
[6292.54s -> 6293.54s]  What are you doing?
[6293.54s -> 6302.82s]  What are you talking about?
[6302.82s -> 6303.82s]  Okay, get the fuck off me.
[6303.82s -> 6304.82s]  Get the fuck off.
[6304.82s -> 6310.29s]  Get the fuck away from me.
[6310.29s -> 6311.29s]  Get away from me.
[6311.29s -> 6312.29s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[6312.29s -> 6317.11s]  I ain't going to fucking have that happen.
[6317.11s -> 6331.49s]  I'm ready to fight the zombies.
[6333.11s -> 6334.11s]  What happened?
[6334.11s -> 6335.11s]  How did I make a pretzel?
[6335.11s -> 6336.11s]  What is this?
[6336.11s -> 6337.11s]  What am I holding?
[6337.11s -> 6338.11s]  What am I holding?
[6338.11s -> 6341.82s]  What am I holding?
[6341.82s -> 6344.47s]  What?
[6344.47s -> 6355.38s]  I don't understand how this happened.
[6355.38s -> 6362.78s]  I can't do it.
[6362.78s -> 6369.54s]  On my screen, it's some sort of interpretive dance.
[6369.54s -> 6370.54s]  Just wait for Desert Bus.
[6370.54s -> 6380.73s]  You guys are going to be fucking lit up for it.
[6380.73s -> 6381.73s]  Oh shit.
[6381.73s -> 6382.73s]  Did I rip it out?
[6382.73s -> 6384.03s]  No, I'm good.
[6384.03s -> 6395.19s]  Okay, that was fucking out of control.
[6395.19s -> 6403.17s]  Alright, let's play this goddamn game.
[6403.17s -> 6404.17s]  Stop!
[6404.17s -> 6405.17s]  Stop, you dick.
[6405.17s -> 6406.17s]  What?
[6406.17s -> 6407.17s]  You're going to kill me.
[6407.17s -> 6408.17s]  It's killing me.
[6408.17s -> 6415.17s]  Do you understand?
[6415.17s -> 6416.17s]  Wish I could be so lucky.
[6416.17s -> 6431.96s]  Am I going to revive?
[6431.96s -> 6442.43s]  Oh no, did it boot us?
[6442.43s -> 6445.31s]  I think it booted us.
[6445.31s -> 6446.31s]  I'm here.
[6446.31s -> 6447.31s]  Okay.
[6447.31s -> 6448.31s]  I'm right here.
[6448.31s -> 6449.31s]  Are you sure?
[6449.31s -> 6452.60s]  Yeah.
[6452.60s -> 6453.60s]  Alright.
[6453.60s -> 6457.53s]  We took so long to get here.
[6457.53s -> 6466.17s]  Give me one of these.
[6466.17s -> 6485.10s]  What are you doing?
[6485.10s -> 6487.91s]  What are you doing?
[6487.91s -> 6490.43s]  Stop.
[6490.43s -> 6491.43s]  Stop.
[6491.43s -> 6492.43s]  Alright.
[6493.43s -> 6494.43s]  No!
[6494.43s -> 6495.43s]  I need to live!
[6495.43s -> 6497.38s]  Kids!
[6497.38s -> 6504.46s]  I can't, we have to...
[6504.46s -> 6506.63s]  It's not...
[6506.63s -> 6510.70s]  You know this is going to be better than the game.
[6510.70s -> 6511.70s]  Is it though?
[6511.70s -> 6512.70s]  Are you sure about that?
[6512.70s -> 6514.01s]  Positive.
[6514.01s -> 6515.01s]  Alright.
[6515.01s -> 6517.38s]  Where are you?
[6517.38s -> 6520.22s]  Soldier.
[6520.22s -> 6523.22s]  Why do you have to keep sitting on the ground?
[6523.22s -> 6526.54s]  Because otherwise I'm like up here.
[6526.54s -> 6531.58s]  You're like eight frames a second by the way.
[6531.58s -> 6534.58s]  The game is not like, you are not supposed to be here.
[6534.58s -> 6539.82s]  This is going to be very odd.
[6539.82s -> 6540.82s]  That's so fucked up.
[6540.82s -> 6542.82s]  That's not normal.
[6543.82s -> 6546.00s]  Alright, soldier.
[6546.00s -> 6548.00s]  Is it fucking huge?
[6548.00s -> 6551.10s]  You don't have to look, just cock it.
[6551.10s -> 6554.42s]  It's already got bolts in it.
[6554.42s -> 6555.42s]  You put that in your ear.
[6555.42s -> 6557.42s]  You put that inside of your...
[6557.42s -> 6559.42s]  You're storing that like a hamster.
[6562.78s -> 6565.30s]  Come on.
[6565.30s -> 6566.30s]  You think you can shoot me?
[6566.30s -> 6568.30s]  Is that what you think?
[6578.99s -> 6579.99s]  Alright, your turn.
[6579.99s -> 6581.99s]  Let me see if I can shoot you.
[6581.99s -> 6586.18s]  Okay.
[6586.18s -> 6587.18s]  Which way is the right way?
[6587.18s -> 6594.11s]  Are we ever going to know what happens to Santa?
[6594.11s -> 6595.54s]  No.
[6595.54s -> 6596.54s]  Oh, you wrecked my face.
[6596.54s -> 6599.42s]  Alright, is there a sniper rifle?
[6599.42s -> 6601.42s]  Yeah, over here.
[6601.42s -> 6605.07s]  This is so awkward.
[6605.07s -> 6608.38s]  Alright, so I want a scope on this.
[6611.38s -> 6612.38s]  This might be the scope.
[6612.38s -> 6614.38s]  No, it's right over here.
[6614.38s -> 6620.51s]  Is this the scope?
[6620.51s -> 6621.51s]  Oh, yeah.
[6621.51s -> 6623.51s]  Oh, there we go.
[6623.51s -> 6627.03s]  That's not working.
[6627.03s -> 6628.03s]  Catch it, catch it, catch it.
[6628.03s -> 6630.03s]  That's not working, you claymation motherfucker.
[6630.03s -> 6635.15s]  How does this go on?
[6638.29s -> 6640.29s]  How do you put on scopes?
[6650.77s -> 6652.77s]  I didn't even get a chance to dodge.
[6652.77s -> 6660.47s]  You holding the scope in one hand?
[6660.47s -> 6664.76s]  You're a genius.
[6666.19s -> 6668.19s]  This got so much more fun.
[6668.19s -> 6669.19s]  This is Groundhog Day.
[6669.19s -> 6671.19s]  It really is, but it doesn't matter.
[6671.19s -> 6673.19s]  We'll get it out of our system in 20 minutes.
[6673.19s -> 6677.86s]  Alright, let's...
[6681.24s -> 6684.44s]  No, get away from me.
[6684.44s -> 6689.56s]  One in each ear.
[6689.56s -> 6695.13s]  Oh, my hand.
[6695.13s -> 6707.63s]  Day 407.
[6707.63s -> 6709.63s]  Alright, we've got to stop.
[6709.63s -> 6712.77s]  I think grenades in this game.
[6712.77s -> 6715.39s]  I hope so.
[6715.39s -> 6720.18s]  Fucking ridiculous.
[6720.18s -> 6726.23s]  Find a grenade so we can play with one.
[6726.23s -> 6738.57s]  What's over here?
[6738.57s -> 6739.57s]  That's not a grenade.
[6739.57s -> 6744.79s]  Go look under there for a grenade.
[6744.79s -> 6755.26s]  No friendly fire with melee, apparently.
[6755.26s -> 6761.58s]  Alright, okay.
[6761.58s -> 6762.58s]  We're done.
[6762.58s -> 6772.59s]  Drop it.
[6772.59s -> 6778.38s]  Drop it.
[6778.38s -> 6779.38s]  Right now.
[6779.38s -> 6780.55s]  I'm shooting you.
[6780.55s -> 6781.55s]  You won't.
[6781.55s -> 6783.24s]  Oh, yeah, hey.
[6783.24s -> 6784.24s]  What's up?
[6784.24s -> 6785.24s]  What's up, right, man?
[6785.24s -> 6786.24s]  Huh?
[6786.24s -> 6787.24s]  No, no, hold your hand up.
[6787.24s -> 6789.06s]  What are you doing?
[6789.06s -> 6790.06s]  See?
[6790.06s -> 6792.06s]  No, I did the fucking movie thing with the guy with the action leg.
[6793.06s -> 6794.06s]  Hey, man.
[6794.06s -> 6796.51s]  Hey, man.
[6796.51s -> 6797.51s]  Hey, man, hey, man.
[6797.51s -> 6798.51s]  No, hey, no.
[6798.51s -> 6799.51s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[6799.51s -> 6801.07s]  Hey.
[6801.07s -> 6803.27s]  Hey, man.
[6803.27s -> 6804.64s]  Hey, man.
[6804.64s -> 6807.03s]  Come on.
[6807.03s -> 6808.03s]  One in the chamber.
[6808.03s -> 6813.56s]  Okay, 4-0-7.
[6813.56s -> 6817.85s]  I am so caught up in this.
[6817.85s -> 6820.85s]  It's not even funny.
[6820.85s -> 6822.85s]  This is the game.
[6822.85s -> 6824.85s]  We have to, okay, it's time to play the game for real.
[6824.85s -> 6825.85s]  You have to leave.
[6825.85s -> 6827.85s]  I'm not going, I'm going to wait until you leave the room.
[6827.85s -> 6830.60s]  Okay, well, we've got to get equipped.
[6830.60s -> 6831.60s]  I'm going to get equipped.
[6831.60s -> 6832.60s]  Okay, you've got to, wait.
[6832.60s -> 6833.60s]  What's your loadout?
[6833.60s -> 6835.60s]  I've got to tell you, my favorite gun is, okay?
[6835.60s -> 6836.60s]  Okay.
[6836.60s -> 6837.60s]  My favorite, what do you think it is?
[6837.60s -> 6841.31s]  Nope, wrong, idiot.
[6841.31s -> 6846.26s]  I thought we just talked about how we were going to play the game, and now I'm like
[6846.26s -> 6849.80s]  injured.
[6849.80s -> 6850.80s]  I'm dead.
[6850.80s -> 6856.01s]  Stop.
[6856.01s -> 6861.90s]  I'm going to shoot you.
[6861.90s -> 6863.14s]  Oh, yeah?
[6863.14s -> 6866.66s]  Is that what you're going to do?
[6866.66s -> 6867.66s]  Hey, man.
[6867.66s -> 6874.66s]  Hey, man.
[6874.66s -> 6889.40s]  Hey.
[6889.40s -> 6892.96s]  All right, don't even tell, okay, let me tell you something, guys.
[6892.96s -> 6897.33s]  Like, it did, 407 days, okay?
[6897.33s -> 6904.14s]  If this is the 407th time you've revived here, at some point, you're going to Bill
[6904.14s -> 6907.62s]  Murray.
[6907.62s -> 6909.62s]  Don't you do it now.
[6909.62s -> 6912.95s]  Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6912.95s -> 6916.66s]  Quick before, shit.
[6916.66s -> 6920.25s]  Hold on, wait, wait.
[6920.25s -> 6922.25s]  Can you shoot through you into me?
[6922.25s -> 6927.62s]  Is it possible that you can, like, blow a hole through you and me?
[6927.62s -> 6930.62s]  Try to shoot yourself in the face.
[6930.62s -> 6936.36s]  How do you always like that?
[6936.36s -> 6940.30s]  Can you, okay, wait, can you, like, outstretch your hand?
[6940.30s -> 6943.50s]  I don't know what's going on with your head.
[6943.50s -> 6945.87s]  No, you just shot me.
[6945.87s -> 6947.87s]  I need a hand gun.
[6947.87s -> 6950.24s]  Wait, I'm smaller than you.
[6950.24s -> 6952.06s]  Hold on.
[6952.06s -> 6957.37s]  I am much smaller than you.
[6957.37s -> 6958.37s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6958.37s -> 6959.37s]  Stay there.
[6959.37s -> 6960.37s]  No, no, no.
[6960.37s -> 6961.37s]  I'm going to die.
[6961.37s -> 6962.37s]  Just wait.
[6962.37s -> 6964.61s]  Okay, you have to guide me, okay?
[6964.61s -> 6965.61s]  I have to what?
[6965.61s -> 6968.17s]  You have to guide me.
[6968.17s -> 6969.17s]  I'll just get behind you.
[6969.17s -> 6970.17s]  I'll line it up.
[6970.17s -> 6972.34s]  Okay, line it up.
[6972.34s -> 6973.34s]  Okay.
[6973.34s -> 6974.34s]  Yeah, yeah, that's on me.
[6974.34s -> 6975.34s]  It's on you?
[6975.34s -> 6976.34s]  Yeah.
[6976.34s -> 6984.71s]  Didn't get me.
[6984.71s -> 6988.71s]  One of us has to fucking call this quits right now, otherwise we'll never leave.
[6988.71s -> 7000.08s]  I'm having a great time.
[7000.08s -> 7001.08s]  Never leave.
[7001.08s -> 7003.08s]  Just stay in here.
[7003.08s -> 7005.08s]  Hey, truce.
[7005.08s -> 7007.38s]  It is time for a truce.
[7007.38s -> 7008.38s]  Actual truce.
[7008.38s -> 7009.38s]  Double high five for a truce.
[7009.38s -> 7010.38s]  Double high five.
[7010.38s -> 7013.33s]  Oh, that was terrible.
[7013.33s -> 7017.95s]  Okay, I actually, like, what are you doing?
[7017.95s -> 7018.95s]  Stop.
[7018.95s -> 7019.95s]  This is supposed to be...
[7019.95s -> 7022.60s]  Yeah, hit me.
[7022.60s -> 7028.77s]  Oh, yeah?
[7028.77s -> 7037.15s]  What am I doing?
[7037.15s -> 7043.38s]  It's his fault.
[7043.38s -> 7047.67s]  He keeps doing it every time.
[7047.67s -> 7048.67s]  I'm the bigger man here.
[7048.67s -> 7049.67s]  No, you got to...
[7049.67s -> 7050.67s]  Literally.
[7050.67s -> 7051.67s]  Literally.
[7051.67s -> 7053.10s]  I'm not leaving.
[7053.10s -> 7054.10s]  No, I am leaving right now.
[7054.10s -> 7058.85s]  Fine.
[7058.85s -> 7059.85s]  Ow.
[7059.85s -> 7062.05s]  Okay.
[7062.05s -> 7063.05s]  Stock up.
[7063.05s -> 7064.05s]  What's...
[7064.05s -> 7065.05s]  Okay.
[7065.05s -> 7066.05s]  Like I was saying before, what is my favorite gun?
[7066.05s -> 7067.05s]  You have to find it.
[7067.05s -> 7070.54s]  If you can find my favorite gun, then nice.
[7070.54s -> 7079.46s]  That's a bad gash on you.
[7079.46s -> 7081.46s]  You fucking idiot.
[7081.46s -> 7087.97s]  You ran out of time.
[7087.97s -> 7090.46s]  That's all right.
[7090.46s -> 7091.46s]  It's this one.
[7091.46s -> 7092.90s]  The default handgun.
[7092.90s -> 7093.90s]  Don't make me look like an idiot.
[7093.90s -> 7094.90s]  It's...
[7094.90s -> 7095.90s]  Where's the deagle?
[7095.90s -> 7096.90s]  This is a deagle, right?
[7096.90s -> 7097.90s]  Yeah, that's a deagle.
[7097.90s -> 7098.90s]  Is this a deagle, Chet?
[7098.90s -> 7099.90s]  Which one of these is the deagle?
[7099.90s -> 7103.18s]  The bigger one.
[7103.18s -> 7104.18s]  This is the big one.
[7104.18s -> 7105.18s]  Will you get away from me?
[7105.18s -> 7107.90s]  Okay.
[7107.90s -> 7111.31s]  That...
[7111.31s -> 7112.31s]  This is the one I like the most.
[7112.31s -> 7113.31s]  I like to do the dual...
[7113.31s -> 7119.61s]  What's his name?
[7119.61s -> 7120.61s]  Deadpool?
[7120.61s -> 7129.02s]  What is it?
[7129.02s -> 7132.24s]  Does Deadpool have two handguns like this?
[7132.24s -> 7133.24s]  Do you know?
[7133.24s -> 7134.74s]  Come on!
[7135.74s -> 7138.74s]  Can you just get some guns and slide them to the door?
[7138.74s -> 7146.90s]  Just get a few guns and slide them to the door.
[7146.90s -> 7149.10s]  I don't care what they are.
[7149.10s -> 7150.10s]  Look, I'm just going to take...
[7150.10s -> 7162.74s]  Whoa.
[7162.74s -> 7163.74s]  Okay.
[7163.74s -> 7164.74s]  No, no, no, no.
[7164.74s -> 7167.74s]  Just because I did it to you doesn't mean you should do it to me.
[7167.74s -> 7169.74s]  Oh.
[7169.74s -> 7170.74s]  Oh.
[7170.74s -> 7171.74s]  Oh.
[7171.74s -> 7172.74s]  Oh.
[7172.74s -> 7173.74s]  Oh.
[7173.74s -> 7174.74s]  Oh.
[7174.74s -> 7177.97s]  Oh.
[7177.97s -> 7178.97s]  Oh.
[7178.97s -> 7191.22s]  Oh.
[7191.22s -> 7193.61s]  Oh.
[7193.61s -> 7194.61s]  Oh.
[7194.61s -> 7195.61s]  Oh.
[7195.61s -> 7196.61s]  Oh.
[7196.61s -> 7197.61s]  You didn't do it to me.
[7197.61s -> 7198.61s]  Oh.
[7198.61s -> 7204.60s]  I'm going to quit the game.
[7204.60s -> 7206.90s]  I was getting ready.
[7206.90s -> 7207.90s]  Oh, yeah.
[7207.90s -> 7210.90s]  You were doing the crab shotgun walk.
[7210.90s -> 7213.90s]  No, the one before that when you shot me in the head twice.
[7213.90s -> 7218.19s]  Yeah, but I couldn't help it.
[7218.19s -> 7219.19s]  That's a shit excuse.
[7219.19s -> 7220.19s]  No, okay.
[7220.19s -> 7222.37s]  I'm getting ready.
[7222.37s -> 7223.93s]  Okay?
[7223.93s -> 7227.94s]  We're going to go shoot zombies.
[7227.94s -> 7231.74s]  Don't even look at each other.
[7231.74s -> 7232.74s]  Don't look at me.
[7232.74s -> 7244.02s]  I like that.
[7244.02s -> 7256.14s]  I'm sorry.
[7256.14s -> 7266.79s]  I'm sorry.
[7266.79s -> 7268.48s]  Get first aid.
[7268.48s -> 7278.81s]  First aid is over here.
[7278.81s -> 7279.81s]  You didn't take that, by the way.
[7279.81s -> 7285.78s]  Okay.
[7285.78s -> 7286.78s]  You didn't take any of those.
[7286.78s -> 7287.78s]  I just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[7287.78s -> 7289.78s]  You did not pick up one of those.
[7289.78s -> 7291.09s]  I did.
[7291.09s -> 7292.09s]  No, you didn't.
[7292.09s -> 7293.09s]  I heard the zip.
[7293.09s -> 7294.26s]  Why?
[7294.26s -> 7295.26s]  They're all on the ground.
[7295.26s -> 7299.08s]  Hey, open your eyes for a second.
[7299.08s -> 7303.20s]  This is the second time you've done this.
[7303.20s -> 7305.46s]  Yeah.
[7305.46s -> 7306.46s]  You got it.
[7306.46s -> 7307.46s]  Okay, let's go.
[7307.46s -> 7308.46s]  Time to go.
[7308.46s -> 7309.46s]  Out that door right now.
[7309.46s -> 7310.46s]  I don't care if you're ready.
[7310.46s -> 7311.46s]  Go.
[7311.46s -> 7338.43s]  I don't have a handgun.
[7338.43s -> 7343.96s]  After you.
[7343.96s -> 7344.96s]  I'll get the fucking door.
[7344.96s -> 7348.95s]  Wait.
[7348.95s -> 7349.95s]  Flashlight.
[7349.95s -> 7351.64s]  Give me the flashlight.
[7351.64s -> 7354.03s]  Wait.
[7354.03s -> 7355.03s]  I need a flashlight.
[7355.03s -> 7356.03s]  Don't move.
[7356.03s -> 7362.20s]  I need an attachment.
[7362.20s -> 7363.20s]  No.
[7363.20s -> 7364.20s]  Who cares?
[7364.20s -> 7365.20s]  I'm going.
[7365.20s -> 7366.20s]  I got a regular flashlight.
[7366.20s -> 7367.20s]  Oh, wait.
[7367.20s -> 7368.95s]  Yeah.
[7368.95s -> 7369.95s]  Where's the attachment?
[7369.95s -> 7373.82s]  Oh, that sucks.
[7373.82s -> 7374.82s]  I'm not doing that again.
[7374.82s -> 7375.82s]  That's sticky keys?
[7375.82s -> 7378.91s]  Here they are.
[7378.91s -> 7379.91s]  All right.
[7379.91s -> 7383.90s]  Where?
[7383.90s -> 7388.47s]  Chapter one.
[7388.47s -> 7389.47s]  How do you attach this shit?
[7389.47s -> 7396.98s]  Who's saying uh-uh?
[7396.98s -> 7397.98s]  Yes.
[7397.98s -> 7402.49s]  Yes.
[7402.49s -> 7403.49s]  That has to be done.
[7403.49s -> 7409.72s]  How?
[7411.47s -> 7413.48s]  Just go.
[7413.48s -> 7445.25s]  Everyone in the chat was fucking screaming at me to shoot you.
[7445.25s -> 7448.49s]  They would like crouch down here and wait for him to shoot him in the back of the head.
[7448.49s -> 7451.49s]  And I was like, guys, we have to play the goddamn game.
[7451.49s -> 7452.49s]  I grabbed that.
[7452.49s -> 7453.49s]  Huh?
[7453.49s -> 7456.07s]  I'm going to get you.
[7456.07s -> 7457.44s]  Oh, you should.
[7457.44s -> 7458.44s]  All right.
[7458.44s -> 7459.68s]  Let's go.
[7459.68s -> 7460.68s]  Where are we going?
[7460.68s -> 7461.92s]  Oh, we have the map.
[7461.92s -> 7465.91s]  Yeah.
[7465.91s -> 7466.91s]  You get the map?
[7466.91s -> 7467.91s]  How do you go to that way?
[7467.91s -> 7468.91s]  I don't see.
[7468.91s -> 7473.29s]  Can you see it?
[7473.29s -> 7474.59s]  Yeah.
[7474.59s -> 7475.59s]  All right.
[7475.59s -> 7477.66s]  Let's go.
[7477.66s -> 7478.66s]  We're going to the white zone.
[7478.66s -> 7479.90s]  Okay.
[7479.90s -> 7480.90s]  We're going to the white circle.
[7480.90s -> 7481.90s]  White circle.
[7481.90s -> 7482.90s]  Go.
[7482.90s -> 7483.90s]  Shoot him.
[7483.90s -> 7488.41s]  He shot me.
[7488.41s -> 7493.94s]  I didn't shoot you.
[7493.94s -> 7494.94s]  My screen's red.
[7494.94s -> 7495.94s]  We've got to go back.
[7495.94s -> 7497.24s]  We've got to go back.
[7497.24s -> 7499.06s]  Why do I have to go back?
[7499.06s -> 7500.06s]  I didn't bring any health.
[7500.06s -> 7501.68s]  Maybe it was just his blood going on me.
[7501.68s -> 7502.68s]  I don't know.
[7502.68s -> 7503.68s]  I'm waiting for you.
[7503.68s -> 7504.68s]  I'm over here.
[7504.68s -> 7505.68s]  Can you see me?
[7505.68s -> 7506.68s]  Okay.
[7506.68s -> 7507.68s]  I'll go first.
[7507.68s -> 7508.68s]  That actually looked kind of cool.
[7509.68s -> 7510.68s]  How do I run faster?
[7510.68s -> 7511.68s]  You have to aim your gun down, then you move faster.
[7511.68s -> 7529.30s]  You do?
[7529.30s -> 7530.30s]  I think so.
[7530.30s -> 7537.05s]  If you have it up and aiming, you move slower.
[7537.05s -> 7541.55s]  You have to have your hands down at your side.
[7541.55s -> 7542.55s]  Hey, we're going this way.
[7542.55s -> 7544.05s]  Okay.
[7544.05s -> 7559.82s]  We look like fucking assholes right now, by the way.
[7559.82s -> 7560.82s]  Just wanted to make sure you're aware of that.
[7560.82s -> 7561.82s]  Double cleave.
[7561.82s -> 7562.82s]  Double cleave.
[7562.82s -> 7564.44s]  Double cleave.
[7564.44s -> 7565.44s]  Double cleave.
[7565.44s -> 7566.44s]  Double cleave.
[7566.44s -> 7571.65s]  Double cleave.
[7571.65s -> 7573.34s]  Double cleave.
[7573.34s -> 7574.34s]  Double cleave.
[7574.34s -> 7575.34s]  Double cleave.
[7575.34s -> 7576.34s]  Double cleave.
[7576.34s -> 7577.34s]  Double cleave.
[7577.34s -> 7581.33s]  Double cleave.
[7581.33s -> 7582.33s]  Double cleave.
[7582.33s -> 7583.33s]  Double cleave.
[7583.33s -> 7593.72s]  Double cleave.
[7593.72s -> 7594.72s]  Double cleave.
[7594.72s -> 7595.72s]  Double cleave.
[7595.72s -> 7596.72s]  Make sure you're aware of that.
[7596.72s -> 7597.72s]  Double cleave.
[7597.72s -> 7604.72s]  Nice work.
[7604.72s -> 7608.97s]  What is this?
[7608.97s -> 7609.97s]  Oh shit.
[7609.97s -> 7616.09s]  Give it, give it, give it a go.
[7616.09s -> 7618.09s]  Help, help, help, help me.
[7618.09s -> 7624.90s]  Good job.
[7624.90s -> 7627.10s]  I don't have a light.
[7627.10s -> 7637.10s]  I can do what Leon Kennedy does.
[7637.10s -> 7639.10s]  You want this?
[7639.10s -> 7640.66s]  Uh, yeah.
[7640.66s -> 7643.57s]  Good.
[7643.57s -> 7650.38s]  Oh my fucking god.
[7650.38s -> 7655.84s]  You were like the most unprepared mercenary.
[7655.84s -> 7661.44s]  unprepared mercenary. I see. I'm dropping my guns, there's my flashlight, I'm like wait hold on.
[7662.08s -> 7665.84s]  All right, like let's go. I don't even care, we're going. Just shine your light.
[7669.09s -> 7673.81s]  You know you left your rifle here. I don't have any more ammo for it. Watch out behind you.
[7673.81s -> 7716.37s]  Whoa whoa whoa! That's why. Is there a clip in here? I have any fucking idea. All right,
[7716.37s -> 7727.95s]  put your guns down and move. Hold on, cover me. All right, covering you. All right,
[7728.03s -> 7759.71s]  I want to look at this map. Yeah, we gotta go left here. Right here? Hey! Hold on. We're even
[7759.71s -> 7766.34s]  pretty heavy over there. I know I gotta. How do you aim this? I'm just putting on like cologne,
[7766.34s -> 7789.14s]  right? Let's move. Is it down here? Yeah. All right, I'll tell you something. I will tell you.
[7790.42s -> 7795.22s]  It is so sweaty in my visor right now. It's like I have goggles on and I'm under water.
[7795.22s -> 7799.14s]  I just want to make sure that you're aware of that. Okay. I'm not at 100% right now. I'm
[7799.14s -> 7821.90s]  at like 30% vision. Where are we going? We're going the right way, right? Yeah.
[7821.90s -> 7834.78s]  There's like a... How many bullets do I have? Behind you. Behind you. Watch out.
[7838.66s -> 7850.06s]  I gotta be out of bullets. That's like 10. Yeah. Hey, you know when you go into a pool that...
[7850.06s -> 7854.22s]  Stop doing that. You know when you go into a pool and the pool is like a public pool
[7854.22s -> 7858.93s]  because a bunch of kids like shit and piss in the pool and stuff? Yeah. And then when you
[7858.93s -> 7862.61s]  get out of that pool, all you see is the haze surrounding everything. The lights all have
[7862.61s -> 7866.13s]  rainbows on them and shit. You're saying you're the kid that shit in the pool?
[7867.62s -> 7875.84s]  Precisely. Pretty much. Like when you go underwater in a public pool and you open
[7875.84s -> 7881.60s]  your eyes, shit is flowing into your eyes. It's clean shit. It's been cleaned. Hey. Hey,
[7881.60s -> 7885.60s]  Donnie. Bet you can't hit that Zed from here. I bet you I can if you just give me a minute
[7885.60s -> 7897.98s]  here. One shot. One shot, Donnie. The new player has joined the game. Oh, no.
[7898.38s -> 7905.60s]  How did we get here? It's better not be like a hacker. Hold on. I'll get it. Was the Zed?
[7906.40s -> 7916.32s]  All right. Where is it? You're lagging so much now. Which one? Either. Pick one.
[7917.04s -> 7929.90s]  But you can't wait till he gets that close. Come on, Donnie. My turn. Watch out behind
[7929.90s -> 7942.22s]  you. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Oops. I'm getting hacked. All right. I see a safe
[7942.22s -> 7953.63s]  house. You're doing all right. Are you putting me out here? Is this like the let's play a game
[7953.63s -> 7959.84s]  with Jerma and then when his back is turned? Oh, no. We're going to go this way. I don't
[7959.84s -> 7967.92s]  have any weapons left. I need to switch this, by the way. I don't like this, by the way. I
[7967.92s -> 7978.93s]  don't want to do this, by the way. Oh, inside of there. There's a house. I don't know what
[7979.09s -> 7998.78s]  this green arrow is. The green circle. Uh oh. What? No. Got it. Jack's activated. Watch out.
[7998.78s -> 8016.70s]  It's the clock tower, girl. Back me up here. Back me up here, please. I am. Uh oh. Back me
[8016.70s -> 8026.83s]  up. Back me up. Back me up here. Star. Star. Star, I don't know what to do. I'll shine the
[8026.83s -> 8063.54s]  light on you. Shoot him. Where's my guns? All right. Jesus. OK. Why can I not take that?
[8063.54s -> 8081.01s]  There we go. All right. I'm helpful. I'm your personal floodlight. You tell me where you want
[8081.01s -> 8083.97s]  it to shine. Why don't we check the houses? There might be ammo because they don't have
[8083.97s -> 8090.70s]  anything. Can I have your axe? I have a lot of ammo. Dad, can I have your axe? Can I play
[8090.70s -> 8102.94s]  the axe? Do you need ammo? Yeah. What is, what guns is for? I don't, I don't have
[8102.94s -> 8110.06s]  this kind of gun. Oh, well. It's not the right gun. You can't hit me or no? No. OK,
[8110.06s -> 8116.70s]  someone, someone is outside. You have to go with him. But you have a drain? Uh,
[8116.70s -> 8142.58s]  let's go, let's go. One, two. There may have been a misunderstanding.
[8143.54s -> 8168.38s]  A player has left the game. He was just trying to help. He was trying to help. He was a good
[8168.38s -> 8178.06s]  guy. And you just fucking blew him away. He came up behind us. Yeah, but he's, zombies
[8178.06s -> 8190.22s]  don't talk. Where am I? Where's my character? Did I like pull a cord out? What? Am I
[8190.30s -> 8211.12s]  running around? I covered my headset. Hello, I'm here. Hi. Hi. Did I put like sweat on
[8211.12s -> 8225.09s]  the headset? Is it like, doesn't know where I am? Wait a minute. OK, hold on. This is,
[8232.34s -> 8242.27s]  hey, kill me. It's a bug. Just shoot me. Just, OK. Oh my God, that was fucking
[8242.27s -> 8250.26s]  outrageous. Are you killing me, please? You're dead. Guy comes in to like help.
[8251.22s -> 8255.78s]  It's like, hey, we're gonna go this way. It says a full three or four sentences. I thought
[8255.78s -> 8261.22s]  he was a zombie, right? He was a zombie. But he got even worse. I can't see anything.
[8261.22s -> 8266.10s]  I was trying to protect you. Oh, that was fucking ridiculous. He just wanted to help.
[8267.73s -> 8283.84s]  And then he was like, he was like, this guy sucks. And he left. I feel like we've
[8283.84s -> 8287.04s]  done this so many times. I'm like, I'm going to work again. You know what I mean?
[8287.04s -> 8291.52s]  All right, just get the fucking ammo. Hey, watch out. There's a zombie behind you.
[8292.16s -> 8296.53s]  I think this person has full leg tracking, by the way.
[8300.08s -> 8304.90s]  You're a zombie. Prove you're not a zombie. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't
[8304.90s -> 8311.58s]  do it. Put it down. She's infected. No, no, they're not. Stop. No reason.
[8313.10s -> 8313.58s]  Put it down.
[8318.61s -> 8321.89s]  Only one of us is making it out of here alive. It's gonna be me.
[8338.78s -> 8340.94s]  Okay, I'm done. I'm out of here.
[8353.36s -> 8359.84s]  All right. Let's get this show on the road. Day four. Let's get ready. Let's get ready.
[8359.84s -> 8364.56s]  Let's go. Let's get ready. Okay. What time is it? All right. Let's go over here.
[8365.28s -> 8369.68s]  I just clucked in. I was like fucking goofball clown stream. There it is. Okay,
[8369.68s -> 8374.48s]  here we go. Let's go over here. Hey, I pick up the sniper rifle. That's what I do typically
[8374.48s -> 8379.92s]  on the first day. You know, grab two of these, three of these. Well, let me load that one.
[8380.72s -> 8384.80s]  Okay. Where's where are those sites? You know, the sites are up here, I think.
[8384.80s -> 8388.08s]  I don't know how to put them on. I think they go like this somehow.
[8389.28s -> 8392.16s]  But they never actually attach. I think it's very different gun
[8393.36s -> 8398.37s]  because they keep saying no way. That's the only sniper rifle. Why would like
[8398.37s -> 8409.74s]  this big scope isn't going to go on here? It keeps saying whoops. I just put that into my head.
[8410.38s -> 8414.99s]  I just like video drone that into my head. Maybe we should do the tutorial.
[8414.99s -> 8420.19s]  Maybe we should have done the tutorial. Hey, hold on. Hey, look at me.
[8421.87s -> 8426.78s]  Hold on. Let me get a good close look at you. You might need to have a little bit
[8426.78s -> 8432.19s]  of skin work done on your pores there. I can't even see you. Well, don't shoot it.
[8432.19s -> 8435.71s]  Don't do it yet. Don't do it yet. You're going to do it right here. Right through the
[8435.71s -> 8450.19s]  scope. What the fuck am I looking at here? Like what you see. Hold on. This is like upside down.
[8450.91s -> 8484.51s]  It is upside down. Am I missing something here? Oh, there we go. Mounting a scope on a scope.
[8485.71s -> 8494.35s]  That almost worked. I can't fucking. All right. I want to get something attached here.
[8495.07s -> 8503.95s]  What was it? Was it grip? They keep saying no. I feel like with the flashlight on this one,
[8503.95s -> 8507.15s]  I just put it near the area and it attaches. I don't even have to press anything.
[8507.71s -> 8524.51s]  Somebody help us out here. Read the sign. Read the sign. Read the sign. Read the sign.
[8524.51s -> 8534.64s]  Out here. Read the sign. Oh. Anybody see sign? No, the sign's right here. Sign.
[8534.64s -> 8540.61s]  You need to find the journal to be able to attach things. What? What do you mean find the
[8540.61s -> 8549.06s]  journal? Look right here. Where? Oh, that. Right. All right. So aren't you able to mount
[8549.06s -> 8554.42s]  an attachment? Find related in three seconds. Try to shoot each other in the journal. Three,
[8554.42s -> 8571.71s]  two, one. I missed that other guy. I know. Yeah, I do too. I would have loved to have another
[8571.71s -> 8574.75s]  player here to have fun with and like know what they were doing, know what he was going.
[8575.81s -> 8578.37s]  But no, I have to shoot that guy. I have to shoot him. I have to unload a whole
[8578.37s -> 8581.49s]  clip on him and then I have to like. To be fair. Do a die hard bit with him.
[8581.49s -> 8593.95s]  The second time I shot myself. Yes, you did. Okay. What else? What other games do we have?
[8594.51s -> 8599.39s]  Desert bus. Desert bus. We're not doing desert bus yet. That's the 12 hour stream for later.
[8601.07s -> 8606.48s]  What's the other one? Tabletop tennis. Nobody wants to see that shit.
[8606.48s -> 8608.64s]  No one wants to see that shit. Nobody wants to see that shit. It's fun,
[8608.64s -> 8614.98s]  but nobody wants to see that shit. We also got. We got two more. What are the other three games?
[8618.30s -> 8623.42s]  I have no idea. What are they? Oh, bar fight. Oh, the bar fight game. Yeah,
[8623.42s -> 8628.94s]  we're going to play bar fight. Tabletop tennis. And then desert bus.
[8630.86s -> 8635.04s]  We can go do bar fight. You want to do bar fight?
[8635.04s -> 8640.88s]  I want to. Hey, let's do one PVP. Do is jet island multiplayer. I actually
[8640.88s -> 8644.72s]  brought up jet island to this guy here, but they said, what did you say? You can,
[8644.72s -> 8647.84s]  you can explain it. I don't remember what is jet island.
[8647.84s -> 8649.84s]  The way you go really fast and you have those tethers.
[8650.88s -> 8654.48s]  You said that you were going to throw up if we played. Oh, no, that was gun haven.
[8654.48s -> 8657.04s]  I said I would vomit over gun haven. Well, if you're going to throw up,
[8657.04s -> 8659.28s]  I don't know what jet island is. Oh, he, guys, he doesn't even know
[8659.28s -> 8664.54s]  what jet island is. He can't even play gun haven. All right, you want to do PVP?
[8667.10s -> 8671.02s]  PVP outside of here, though. No bullshit. You only get one gun.
[8671.02s -> 8672.86s]  Well, no, no, no. We'll get all the, what do you call those guns?
[8672.86s -> 8677.74s]  You got a ton of guns on you. Go out that door. I'll go out this door
[8677.74s -> 8681.98s]  and like inside the fenced area, PVP. What do you mean? What's the fenced area?
[8682.62s -> 8684.78s]  Like right outside this whole area is fenced in.
[8685.42s -> 8689.18s]  So you're talking about like out of this room. No, no, no. Get back in here.
[8689.18s -> 8691.82s]  I want to examine your shit. Come here. Let me see.
[8691.82s -> 8698.14s]  In case you have, you have a large supersized Uzi. You have a regular Uzi.
[8699.02s -> 8701.50s]  Okay. Is that all you have? That's it.
[8701.50s -> 8704.70s]  Okay. I have a handgun in my pocket.
[8704.70s -> 8709.54s]  Okay. I'm going to go with handgun. It was a very stupid way to pick that up.
[8712.19s -> 8719.06s]  Okay. Gun safety. Okay. Gun.
[8720.82s -> 8722.90s]  I'm also going to go. Are we allowed to have first aid?
[8723.87s -> 8728.10s]  No. Okay. Fine. Oops.
[8728.74s -> 8749.62s]  What are you doing? Never mind.
[8749.62s -> 8763.90s]  All right. I'm going with this. This speaks to me. This is all I need.
[8768.06s -> 8771.66s]  Okay. I'm going out there. So we're going to do like,
[8771.66s -> 8774.30s]  are we doing a 10 paces thing and then we'll turn around and let go?
[8774.30s -> 8776.86s]  No. We're just, as soon as you're out here, if we see each other.
[8777.66s -> 8780.40s]  Okay. So we're out like this door here. You mean like out here?
[8780.40s -> 8783.12s]  No. The other door. Okay. So I'm going.
[8783.12s -> 8789.92s]  You ready? You're not doing it right.
[8791.20s -> 8795.95s]  You don't understand. No, you don't understand.
[8795.95s -> 8800.02s]  I don't want to hit the wall. I'm like, I'm trying to associate myself.
[8800.02s -> 8803.60s]  So I don't hit the wall. Go outside.
[8803.60s -> 8806.14s]  I'm just tangled. God damn it.
[8807.81s -> 8815.01s]  Hold on. I'm just tangled up here. All right. Let's go. You ready?
[8815.73s -> 8872.80s]  What? Oh, shit. It's me.
[8872.80s -> 8876.96s]  All right. That's two out of three. Handguns only. No, like no rapid fire bullshit.
[8876.96s -> 8879.28s]  We're talking about weapons that were like before like the 1900s.
[8879.28s -> 8881.04s]  You know what I'm saying? Only single shot handguns.
[8881.92s -> 8884.40s]  Yeah. Weapons that were like used in the civil war.
[8886.08s -> 8890.88s]  Only single shot handguns. Weapons that were created back in the 1930s.
[8892.00s -> 8896.83s]  None of this bullshit. None of this like rat tat tat bullshit.
[8897.55s -> 8903.38s]  We're talking shotgun pistol. I'm just it's pistol time.
[8904.10s -> 8915.41s]  No, no, no, no. I went back in the 1950s.
[8915.41s -> 8916.85s]  They didn't have flashlights on their guns.
[8917.41s -> 8927.17s]  Fine. You will pull that. You only get one handgun by the way.
[8928.91s -> 8930.91s]  I don't know. One shotgun. I'm ready.
[8930.91s -> 8932.91s]  I'm turning to yell at that to you for some reason.
[8936.82s -> 8955.68s]  I'm outside. I'm ready. Wait, wait. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
[8955.68s -> 8961.97s]  I'm just making sure you're ready. Are you ready?
[8962.53s -> 8970.13s]  I'm ready. I'm coming.
[8973.58s -> 8974.46s]  Trying to get my foot in here.
[8979.39s -> 8979.89s]  Coming.
[9011.98s -> 9013.66s]  Sitting there entrenched.
[9016.38s -> 9019.82s]  I'm trying to like bait you. I've got the flashlight bouncing.
[9020.46s -> 9021.82s]  All right. That's two out of three.
[9022.46s -> 9025.20s]  Just get a handgun. No shotguns.
[9025.20s -> 9026.80s]  Oh no. You know what? Fucking handguns only.
[9027.52s -> 9029.44s]  Only handguns. No slappers.
[9029.44s -> 9031.44s]  No. No handguns. Only flashlight.
[9033.23s -> 9034.99s]  Okay. Hold on a minute here. Let me go.
[9037.55s -> 9040.32s]  Okay. Just making sure it works.
[9072.50s -> 9076.16s]  You're going to die. I'm right behind you.
[9161.76s -> 9181.90s]  I mean, I still have my gun. God, just deal with me.
[9181.90s -> 9183.82s]  Oh, you fucking liar. You liar.
[9183.82s -> 9186.46s]  Post. Host bullshit. Host bullshit.
[9188.19s -> 9193.70s]  Got him.
[9193.70s -> 9194.82s]  That was actually fun.
[9194.82s -> 9201.90s]  Like I didn't want to play the PVP military VR games because it seemed.
[9201.90s -> 9203.95s]  What, Pavlov?
[9203.95s -> 9204.67s]  Yeah.
[9204.67s -> 9206.54s]  What do you got against Pavlov?
[9207.02s -> 9210.30s]  Nothing. Now that we've had the 1v1.
[9210.30s -> 9212.88s]  We were going to play Pavlov.
[9213.44s -> 9215.90s]  This is a mess underneath me.
[9215.90s -> 9218.22s]  All right. Last one. Sniper rifles only.
[9218.78s -> 9230.24s]  Okay. You ready?
[9233.98s -> 9235.98s]  We've got to count to like 30 seconds, by the way.
[9249.44s -> 9250.56s]  Okay. You ready?
[9254.16s -> 9299.81s]  Yeah.
[9299.81s -> 9304.80s]  What? How? How are you doing that?
[9306.30s -> 9306.94s]  What?
[9306.94s -> 9313.92s]  How did you? I don't know who you were.
[9313.92s -> 9316.19s]  I flanked you.
[9316.19s -> 9325.12s]  All right. This game's fun.
[9325.60s -> 9327.84s]  We were doing a lot of shit talking at the tutorial.
[9327.84s -> 9333.04s]  Because the tutorial isn't good. Everything else.
[9333.68s -> 9335.55s]  This is really fun, though.
[9335.55s -> 9340.19s]  I could see like getting two, possibly three people in here.
[9340.19s -> 9342.29s]  And the third person like kind of knows what they're doing.
[9342.29s -> 9343.73s]  It's like trying to give like some advice.
[9346.77s -> 9347.41s]  Fun, I think.
[9356.14s -> 9357.74s]  All right. I'm going to get some water.
[9357.74s -> 9358.94s]  You want to take like a two minute break?
[9360.22s -> 9360.78s]  Sure.
[9360.78s -> 9362.38s]  Just to get out of the headset. Get some water.
[9363.26s -> 9364.94s]  Drunken bar fight or?
[9364.94s -> 9366.54s]  Drunken bar fight is next.
[9366.54s -> 9367.42s]  Or bus next.
[9368.30s -> 9369.18s]  How long have we been going?
[9370.14s -> 9371.26s]  That's a good question. Let's find out.
[9376.58s -> 9377.62s]  Just about two and a half hours.
[9381.87s -> 9382.99s]  We'll do drunken bar fight.
[9384.02s -> 9388.98s]  And then from drunken bar fight we'll go to a desert bus.
[9391.07s -> 9391.39s]  Okay.
[9392.46s -> 9396.43s]  So go grab yourself a water and we'll return.
[9397.25s -> 9398.21s]  I'm going to hydrate up.
[9400.53s -> 9402.05s]  Don't you need to get drunk for that?
[9404.43s -> 9405.31s]  Theoretically, no.
[9405.95s -> 9408.18s]  I've been drunk this whole time.
[9408.82s -> 9409.78s]  All right. Be right back.
[9410.42s -> 9631.71s]  Hello.
[9631.71s -> 9635.33s]  We are just waiting for stir.
[9635.33s -> 9642.40s]  And then we can continue with the drunken bar fight.
[9642.40s -> 9645.87s]  As we'll just get it open now.
[9646.51s -> 9648.74s]  Oh, you're here.
[9650.62s -> 9650.94s]  Okay.
[9650.94s -> 9651.58s]  Yep.
[9651.58s -> 9655.84s]  Now let's figure out how we jump into this as a team.
[9658.93s -> 9661.49s]  I missed. I missed massive bits, did I?
[9662.13s -> 9670.03s]  Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see.
[9675.20s -> 9676.40s]  Yeah, yeah, we did.
[9677.36s -> 9678.16s]  Bloody doctor.
[9678.96s -> 9681.55s]  Thank you, bloody, if you're bloody doctor, if you're still here.
[9683.38s -> 9686.66s]  Is a 50 dollars, 5,000 bits from bloody doctor.
[9686.66s -> 9687.38s]  Thank you so much.
[9690.58s -> 9691.62s]  Sorry I missed it.
[9691.62s -> 9695.12s]  I was immersed in virtual reality.
[9697.42s -> 9700.70s]  But they said you should mute stir on discord and use the in game voice.
[9700.70s -> 9707.23s]  It's more immersive, but it's not as crisp.
[9707.87s -> 9710.14s]  Yeah, we're all about crispness here.
[9710.14s -> 9711.02s]  You're not as crispy.
[9711.66s -> 9715.30s]  Oh, by the way, I just burped and tasted food.
[9715.30s -> 9717.46s]  So I'm going to tell you a little story about a dream I had last night.
[9717.46s -> 9718.26s]  You're going to like this one.
[9718.98s -> 9721.84s]  So you're, you're aware of the chef Gordon Ramsay, right?
[9722.56s -> 9723.68s]  Um, yes.
[9724.24s -> 9728.24s]  So I had a dream that I went to one of his kitchen nightmares restaurants.
[9729.47s -> 9729.95s]  With him.
[9730.75s -> 9734.75s]  Me, Kim and Gordon Ramsay, it went to one of his kitchen nightmares.
[9734.75s -> 9736.19s]  I like the idea.
[9736.19s -> 9737.55s]  I'm coming back to check on it.
[9737.55s -> 9738.51s]  You know, he does that sometimes.
[9738.51s -> 9739.39s]  I was there for some reason.
[9739.39s -> 9739.87s]  I don't know why.
[9740.77s -> 9743.49s]  So we sit down at the table.
[9743.49s -> 9744.61s]  We try a bunch of the food.
[9744.61s -> 9745.73s]  He's ordering a bunch of shit.
[9746.53s -> 9748.29s]  And me and Kim are like, oh, this is delicious.
[9748.29s -> 9748.93s]  This is great.
[9748.93s -> 9749.89s]  He's like, what do you think about that?
[9749.89s -> 9751.09s]  Isn't that much more tender?
[9751.09s -> 9752.45s]  We're like, yeah, it's great.
[9752.45s -> 9755.49s]  So anyways, we eat like, I don't know, a hundred dollars worth of food
[9755.49s -> 9756.37s]  and the check comes.
[9757.49s -> 9762.85s]  And I was having like this in dream panic of do I have to pick up this check?
[9763.73s -> 9765.73s]  And Gordon Ramsay was like kind of looking at it.
[9765.73s -> 9768.93s]  I was looking at it with like, I was like, is the show paying for this?
[9769.57s -> 9770.45s]  I didn't say that.
[9771.25s -> 9773.57s]  And like, I kind of got up and was moving around this check.
[9773.57s -> 9776.21s]  Like that check is laying on the table and neither one of us are touching it.
[9778.22s -> 9779.90s]  And then I woke up panicking.
[9779.90s -> 9782.50s]  It could be worse.
[9782.50s -> 9783.46s]  It could have been way worse.
[9783.46s -> 9783.62s]  Yeah.
[9783.62s -> 9784.98s]  But like that it was weird.
[9785.70s -> 9788.13s]  It was an actual dream.
[9789.09s -> 9792.29s]  I had a dream recently that was I told my stream.
[9792.29s -> 9795.25s]  I mean, Donald Trump were laying in bed together staring at the ceiling
[9795.25s -> 9797.49s]  and he was telling me how bad he felt.
[9798.21s -> 9802.32s]  And I was just listening to him and I felt bad for him.
[9802.32s -> 9803.04s]  And then I woke up.
[9804.40s -> 9804.80s]  Yeah.
[9804.80s -> 9806.64s]  He was like, people really don't like me anymore.
[9807.28s -> 9809.28s]  It's really weird.
[9809.28s -> 9810.24s]  Scott, let me tell you.
[9810.88s -> 9812.38s]  I don't know what it is about people.
[9812.94s -> 9813.74s]  They don't like me.
[9813.74s -> 9814.38s]  I don't know why.
[9817.01s -> 9817.73s]  All right.
[9817.73s -> 9818.45s]  Are you inviting me?
[9819.25s -> 9819.49s]  Yeah.
[9820.66s -> 9820.98s]  Okay.
[9820.98s -> 9823.30s]  I just clicked a hey German meet me at the bar.
[9824.02s -> 9828.26s]  You know, you know, I really wish you'd make TF2 videos again.
[9830.50s -> 9832.18s]  It really, I would love that.
[9832.18s -> 9832.50s]  All right.
[9832.50s -> 9837.44s]  Uh, the first thing he said, hold on.
[9837.44s -> 9839.10s]  I can't hear you.
[9839.10s -> 9839.58s]  Don't talk.
[9839.58s -> 9841.34s]  Oh, but there's a guy that drives.
[9841.34s -> 9841.58s]  Yeah.
[9841.58s -> 9844.78s]  There's a guy that drives by the house like 15 times a day going like
[9844.78s -> 9846.86s]  40, 50 miles per hour in a God damn neighborhood.
[9847.74s -> 9850.24s]  Just making an appearance on every stream.
[9854.67s -> 9856.42s]  Hold on.
[9856.42s -> 9857.62s]  Oh, yeah.
[9857.62s -> 9858.42s]  Why are you doing this to me?
[9858.42s -> 9858.82s]  Headset.
[9862.16s -> 9862.40s]  All right.
[9862.40s -> 9866.96s]  One more drink of my officially not sponsored Canada dry ginger ale.
[9867.60s -> 9868.64s]  And I mean that for real.
[9868.64s -> 9869.12s]  It's not.
[9871.98s -> 9872.30s]  Okay.
[9872.94s -> 9873.50s]  Can you see me?
[9874.06s -> 9875.26s]  You guys can't see anything.
[9875.26s -> 9875.50s]  Why?
[9877.73s -> 9878.45s]  Oh, that's why.
[9892.35s -> 9893.95s]  Ginger ale isn't hydration.
[9893.95s -> 9895.23s]  There's plenty of water in that.
[9897.10s -> 9899.58s]  Ginger ale just like when you drink ginger ale.
[9900.14s -> 9901.98s]  It instantly forms gas.
[9901.98s -> 9903.58s]  It shoots out of your system.
[9903.58s -> 9906.99s]  It's the worst soft drink because I love it though.
[9906.99s -> 9907.98s]  All right.
[9907.98s -> 9908.54s]  What's new?
[9908.54s -> 9910.38s]  Waiting, waiting for you at the bar.
[9910.38s -> 9913.74s]  Said you'd be here looking at my, looking at my watch.
[9913.74s -> 9914.54s]  Said you'd be here.
[9931.01s -> 9931.33s]  Okay.
[9931.33s -> 9933.62s]  So where are you at?
[9935.70s -> 9936.34s]  Hold on.
[9936.34s -> 9937.78s]  Don't don't don't don't don't.
[9937.78s -> 9938.26s]  Nobody move.
[9938.82s -> 9941.49s]  Now you can move.
[9946.61s -> 9948.99s]  Hey, Jerma, meet at the bar.
[9949.79s -> 9952.90s]  How do we do that?
[9952.90s -> 9954.30s]  Meet at the bar.
[9958.21s -> 9959.73s]  How do you have two hours in this game?
[9960.45s -> 9962.75s]  That's how long I've been waiting for you.
[9962.75s -> 9964.51s]  If you've already played this.
[9965.39s -> 9967.87s]  No, I've been sitting here waiting at the bar.
[9967.87s -> 9968.43s]  1.8 hours.
[9968.99s -> 9969.23s]  All right.
[9969.23s -> 9971.92s]  How do I accept your invite?
[9971.92s -> 9972.72s]  I don't know.

[10072.53s -> 10073.25s]  Are you in there?
[10074.13s -> 10074.93s]  Are you in the bar?
[10075.97s -> 10076.93s]  I got a loading screen.
[10088.08s -> 10088.64s]  There you are.
[10089.20s -> 10089.76s]  That's you.
[10090.48s -> 10093.44s]  Hey, what's a good country band to get into to sell my look?
[10093.44s -> 10094.40s]  I don't know which one is you.
[10095.12s -> 10096.64s]  I'm the one sitting at the laptop.
[10105.87s -> 10107.63s]  Hey, behind you.
[10107.63s -> 10109.23s]  Anyone got anything that'll wake me up?
[10110.27s -> 10111.23s]  You're sitting over here.
[10111.23s -> 10111.71s]  That's you.
[10112.35s -> 10113.47s]  I'm sitting at the laptop.
[10115.47s -> 10118.85s]  You trying to start a fight?
[10120.82s -> 10122.42s]  Something fucking weird is happening.
[10123.44s -> 10123.60s]  What?
[10123.60s -> 10124.08s]  Why?
[10124.08s -> 10124.56s]  Okay.
[10124.56s -> 10124.96s]  Okay.
[10128.86s -> 10130.22s]  What's going on with my room here?
[10130.22s -> 10130.46s]  Why?
[10130.46s -> 10131.42s]  What's with my hands?
[10132.14s -> 10137.41s]  Come on.
[10137.97s -> 10139.81s]  This is such a fucking YouTuber game.
[10140.77s -> 10141.65s]  It really is.
[10141.65s -> 10143.73s]  It's not like one to one for some reason for me.
[10148.53s -> 10149.81s]  Not the napkin dispenser.
[10151.65s -> 10152.05s]  Get up.
[10152.61s -> 10159.54s]  The bartender won't serve you down there.
[10159.54s -> 10161.70s]  Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.
[10161.70s -> 10162.66s]  Who's this guy?
[10162.66s -> 10168.43s]  Happy New Year.
[10169.31s -> 10170.43s]  Happy New Year.
[10171.23s -> 10171.95s]  That was fun.
[10171.95s -> 10172.43s]  We did it.
[10173.39s -> 10173.87s]  That was it.
[10177.07s -> 10179.07s]  You can't just immediately start fights.
[10182.21s -> 10183.49s]  He doesn't even know you're doing it.
[10183.49s -> 10183.97s]  Let me show you.
[10183.97s -> 10184.93s]  All right.
[10184.93s -> 10185.41s]  Where are you?
[10192.61s -> 10194.53s]  Are you trying to stick his head through?
[10195.65s -> 10201.14s]  Are you hitting me?
[10202.10s -> 10208.70s]  This is the jankiest game ever.
[10209.58s -> 10212.08s]  I'm up.
[10212.96s -> 10213.92s]  Oh, he's part of the fight.

[10224.46s -> 10229.70s]  I got your back.
[10229.70s -> 10230.50s]  I got your back.
[10230.50s -> 10231.38s]  No, I got your back.
[10251.74s -> 10252.94s]  We're taking out the whole bar.
[10265.04s -> 10266.72s]  Get everybody involved.
[10266.72s -> 10267.84s]  Get everyone involved.
[10272.48s -> 10272.80s]  All right.
[10272.80s -> 10274.24s]  Concentrate up.
[10274.24s -> 10275.12s]  Strategy, strategy.
[10275.52s -> 10278.72s]  We got to start strolling because we got to get everybody before the cops show up.
[10278.72s -> 10279.04s]  Okay.
[10279.04s -> 10279.92s]  So how do you want to do this?
[10282.66s -> 10283.78s]  Get the weapons in the right place.
[10287.49s -> 10288.45s]  Everything is a weapon.
[10289.17s -> 10293.76s]  This guy's a walking cane.
[10294.56s -> 10295.04s]  I'm going in.
[10295.04s -> 10296.32s]  I'm going Indiana Jones style.
[10297.20s -> 10297.92s]  You ready?
[10297.92s -> 10298.64s]  Oh, my God.
[10299.52s -> 10300.29s]  Hit him.
[10306.24s -> 10313.26s]  Hey, hey, who's whipping me?
[10321.84s -> 10335.66s]  I'm trying to get this guy in the fucking teeth.
[10336.46s -> 10342.46s]  All right.
[10342.46s -> 10343.50s]  Quick, I got to try to get away.
[10349.71s -> 10350.91s]  Also, there's another bar.
[10351.63s -> 10352.91s]  I don't know how to leave this one now.
[10354.93s -> 10356.13s]  No, I didn't mean to do that.
[10356.13s -> 10356.69s]  Let's do it.
[10361.49s -> 10363.66s]  Where did you get the whip?
[10363.66s -> 10369.38s]  Oh, this is my fantasy.
[10372.96s -> 10374.61s]  All right.
[10374.61s -> 10375.49s]  Come on, come on, come on.
[10377.01s -> 10379.01s]  You flew across the whole screen for me.
[10380.85s -> 10381.41s]  Get up.
[10381.41s -> 10381.81s]  Get up.
[10381.81s -> 10382.21s]  Help me.
[10383.76s -> 10384.56s]  Help me.
[10384.56s -> 10385.04s]  Pick me up.
[10385.76s -> 10386.24s]  What?
[10387.30s -> 10387.70s]  Wow.
[10388.26s -> 10392.51s]  This is crap.
[10392.51s -> 10394.03s]  What the fuck did we just see?
[10394.03s -> 10394.99s]  All those teeth.
[10394.99s -> 10395.71s]  Okay.
[10395.71s -> 10396.03s]  All right.
[10396.03s -> 10396.83s]  This guy's got to go.
[10397.39s -> 10398.19s]  What did I just do?
[10399.07s -> 10400.11s]  Oh, German.
[10400.83s -> 10401.23s]  Hold on.
[10401.23s -> 10401.63s]  Hold on.
[10401.63s -> 10402.19s]  Emergency.
[10402.99s -> 10408.34s]  All right.
[10408.34s -> 10408.98s]  I got an idea.
[10408.98s -> 10410.90s]  Get a bunch of weapons up there.
[10410.90s -> 10411.78s]  We got to fucking push it.
[10411.78s -> 10412.66s]  Look at me.
[10412.66s -> 10413.94s]  I want to see if this looks...
[10414.90s -> 10418.82s]  I was lifting my legs with my own guitar.
[10418.82s -> 10419.62s]  Is you going to sit on...
[10423.82s -> 10426.62s]  That's so, so fucking stupid.
[10429.14s -> 10429.86s]  I'm going to kick you.
[10430.58s -> 10432.06s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[10432.06s -> 10432.86s]  Hold on.
[10432.86s -> 10440.43s]  How are you doing that?
[10445.81s -> 10447.12s]  All right.
[10447.12s -> 10447.52s]  We got to...
[10448.16s -> 10448.96s]  Hold on.
[10448.96s -> 10451.98s]  Whose phone is this?
[10452.78s -> 10459.28s]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[10459.28s -> 10460.40s]  I don't want to do that.
[10460.40s -> 10460.93s]  Here.
[10460.93s -> 10461.97s]  Open your mouth.
[10461.97s -> 10462.53s]  No, no, no.
[10462.53s -> 10462.93s]  You.
[10462.93s -> 10463.17s]  You.
[10468.14s -> 10468.70s]  I'm drunk.
[10469.82s -> 10470.86s]  Hey, open up, bro.
[10473.68s -> 10476.19s]  Open up, bro.
[10479.50s -> 10480.54s]  Devil's Cocktail.
[10481.57s -> 10482.53s]  I call this one.
[10482.53s -> 10484.61s]  The bartender won't serve you down there.
[10484.61s -> 10486.45s]  Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.
[10487.17s -> 10490.11s]  Come on, bro.
[10490.11s -> 10490.59s]  Yeah, it's...
[10491.94s -> 10494.74s]  Cherry sauce, vodka, and a Guinness.
[10498.22s -> 10499.98s]  I don't know how to go to the other bar.
[10499.98s -> 10501.10s]  I don't know how to do anything.
[10501.10s -> 10502.30s]  Can we just walk out the door?
[10503.26s -> 10504.46s]  I couldn't walk all the way there.
[10509.36s -> 10509.92s]  All right, let's go.
[10509.92s -> 10510.88s]  I'm done.
[10510.88s -> 10511.52s]  Turn my way.
[10512.32s -> 10512.80s]  I can't...
[10512.80s -> 10513.60s]  You get stuck here.
[10514.56s -> 10517.70s]  You get the fuck out of here.
[10517.70s -> 10518.34s]  Get out of here.
[10519.54s -> 10521.78s]  Did he just drop kick me?
[10521.78s -> 10522.42s]  I think he did.
[10530.24s -> 10530.64s]  Oh, boy.
[10530.64s -> 10532.48s]  The bartender won't serve you down there.
[10532.48s -> 10533.52s]  Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.
[10533.52s -> 10534.32s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[10536.45s -> 10537.33s]  I've got the play.
[10539.07s -> 10540.11s]  Come here, come here.
[10540.11s -> 10540.59s]  Have you seen me?
[10540.59s -> 10541.31s]  What's the play?
[10541.31s -> 10544.27s]  I want you are going to one-v-one mail him.
[10544.27s -> 10544.51s]  Yeah, yeah.
[10544.51s -> 10545.55s]  All right, what's going on, bro?
[10545.55s -> 10546.03s]  What do you want to do?
[10546.83s -> 10547.55s]  I want you...
[10547.55s -> 10548.51s]  You can take that guy on.
[10548.51s -> 10549.07s]  What's up?
[10549.07s -> 10549.63s]  That guy right there?
[10549.63s -> 10550.59s]  That guy in the bar.
[10550.59s -> 10550.83s]  Yeah.
[10550.83s -> 10551.87s]  That fucking piece of shit.
[10551.87s -> 10552.27s]  What'd he do?
[10553.63s -> 10554.67s]  Did he talk shit to you?
[10556.11s -> 10558.11s]  He said I look like Mickey Mouse.
[10558.11s -> 10559.47s]  Oh, man, bro.
[10559.47s -> 10560.27s]  I'll just...
[10560.27s -> 10560.75s]  Wait.
[10560.75s -> 10561.15s]  Hold on.
[10561.15s -> 10561.47s]  You good?
[10562.45s -> 10562.85s]  You good?

[10564.37s -> 10564.93s]  Man, come on.
[10564.93s -> 10565.25s]  Light up.
[10565.25s -> 10565.65s]  You good?
[10565.65s -> 10565.97s]  All right.
[10565.97s -> 10566.29s]  You good?

[10574.59s -> 10575.55s]  My buddy over there.
[10575.55s -> 10578.27s]  Uh, you tell me he looks like a fucking cartoon character?
[10578.27s -> 10578.83s]  Is that what you said?
[10580.43s -> 10581.07s]  Mickey Mouse.
[10581.71s -> 10584.99s]  Kind of like that fucking Mickey Mouse fucking necklace you got on, right?
[10586.59s -> 10588.61s]  Finish him.
[10589.89s -> 10590.51s]  All right.
[10591.71s -> 10597.14s]  Don't you ever say shit to my friend again.
[10597.14s -> 10598.10s]  What are you looking at?
[10598.10s -> 10598.60s]  Fucker.
[10611.71s -> 10613.23s]  I can't even look.
[10613.23s -> 10615.50s]  You don't have to.
[10615.50s -> 10619.50s]  Next time, you should pick yourself up.
[10627.30s -> 10632.26s]  This is like 0.1% of GTA if it was in VR.
[10632.58s -> 10633.08s]  Oh.
[10635.14s -> 10636.02s]  Dude, you should have seen.
[10636.02s -> 10637.06s]  You're going like this, man.
[10638.18s -> 10639.30s]  It's fucking hilarious.
[10640.26s -> 10641.78s]  I miss my fucking laptop.
[10642.34s -> 10642.58s]  All right.
[10642.58s -> 10643.78s]  Can we get out of this bar?
[10644.90s -> 10647.28s]  Don't fight me, buddy.
[10647.28s -> 10648.00s]  Just wait.
[10648.00s -> 10648.80s]  Just walk out here.
[10649.76s -> 10651.09s]  Hold on, man.
[10662.05s -> 10662.93s]  You sicko.
[10663.81s -> 10665.49s]  All right.
[10665.49s -> 10667.09s]  Let's get the fuck out of here.
[10669.17s -> 10669.49s]  Was that fucked up?
[10669.49s -> 10670.69s]  You could never leave.
[10670.69s -> 10671.49s]  Was that fucked up?
[10677.26s -> 10677.76s]  All right.
[10680.46s -> 10681.10s]  Just right.
[10687.22s -> 10688.34s]  I didn't do anything.
[10688.90s -> 10689.94s]  Why are you fighting me?
[10691.22s -> 10692.34s]  I didn't do shit.
[10693.22s -> 10695.14s]  He's the one guy.
[10695.14s -> 10698.10s]  Your character is so fucking lanky.
[10711.78s -> 10713.54s]  Maybe next time, you should pick yourself up.
[10713.54s -> 10713.86s]  All right.
[10713.86s -> 10714.58s]  All right.
[10714.58s -> 10715.22s]  Exit menu.
[10715.22s -> 10715.62s]  Hit menu.
[10715.62s -> 10716.66s]  Hit menu.
[10716.66s -> 10717.62s]  I don't know how.
[10717.62s -> 10717.86s]  Oh.
[10718.66s -> 10719.94s]  Let's hit menu to get out of this bar.
[10721.98s -> 10722.30s]  All right.
[10722.30s -> 10723.02s]  Let's go to another bar.
[10723.02s -> 10723.74s]  What is the menu?
[10725.26s -> 10726.86s]  It's top right button on the bar.
[10729.14s -> 10730.26s]  Trigger to play again.
[10730.26s -> 10730.50s]  Okay.
[10730.50s -> 10731.06s]  No, I left.
[10731.86s -> 10732.42s]  Are we together?
[10733.70s -> 10734.10s]  No.
[10734.10s -> 10735.46s]  I can invite you to the other bar.
[10735.46s -> 10736.74s]  I think there's only two.
[10736.74s -> 10737.86s]  Let's go to the other bar.
[10737.86s -> 10738.90s]  I'm going to fucking puke.
[10741.34s -> 10741.66s]  Oh, no.
[10741.66s -> 10742.38s]  There's like a...
[10743.18s -> 10745.65s]  Okay.
[10745.65s -> 10745.97s]  Hold on.
[10745.97s -> 10746.37s]  Hold on.
[10748.99s -> 10751.07s]  If I get KO'd, you have to pick yourself up.
[10751.07s -> 10752.03s]  Can you go in the elevator?
[10752.83s -> 10753.55s]  Oh, shit.
[10753.55s -> 10755.07s]  You can go in the goddamn elevator.
[10756.27s -> 10758.27s]  I don't see you online to invite anymore.
[10758.83s -> 10759.47s]  Oh, no.
[10760.75s -> 10762.83s]  There's a bar up top, too, man.
[10762.83s -> 10763.07s]  Yeah.
[10763.07s -> 10763.95s]  That's where I am right now.
[10763.95s -> 10765.15s]  I'm at the supply party.
[10765.15s -> 10765.71s]  Are you here?
[10767.07s -> 10767.71s]  Should I invite you?
[10767.71s -> 10769.47s]  No, because we have to actually join each other.
[10769.47s -> 10769.71s]  Yeah.
[10769.71s -> 10771.39s]  How did you join off the invite?
[10771.39s -> 10772.59s]  Uh, I just...
[10772.59s -> 10773.39s]  So I went to the...
[10775.89s -> 10776.69s]  This is going to be a bad...
[10776.69s -> 10777.65s]  It's going to be a problem here.
[10779.41s -> 10781.73s]  You go into your, like, SteamVR menu.
[10782.45s -> 10783.65s]  Oh, I'm going to, like, mess...
[10783.65s -> 10783.97s]  You got me?
[10783.97s -> 10785.25s]  Hey, German, meet me at the bar.
[10786.77s -> 10787.74s]  Are you coming to me?
[10789.02s -> 10789.90s]  I send you an invite.
[10789.90s -> 10790.62s]  Okay, I'm coming to you.
[10794.13s -> 10795.81s]  When you see this shit, you're going to be, uh...
[10798.50s -> 10799.54s]  You're going to be a little, uh...
[10799.54s -> 10801.22s]  You're going to be a little shocked by what you see.
[10802.90s -> 10804.18s]  How are the cops going to get up here?
[10805.06s -> 10805.54s]  I don't know.
[10805.54s -> 10806.10s]  Are you...
[10807.22s -> 10807.94s]  Did I join you?
[10809.78s -> 10810.50s]  I don't think so.
[10810.50s -> 10810.98s]  I don't see you.
[10810.98s -> 10811.86s]  You accepted an invitation.
[10814.42s -> 10815.14s]  Do I have to leave?
[10816.18s -> 10821.49s]  You accepted an invitation to play drug and bar fight.
[10821.49s -> 10822.13s]  Okay.
[10822.13s -> 10824.77s]  So, meet me at the bar.
[10825.73s -> 10830.05s]  I might have to leave.
[10830.85s -> 10832.05s]  Yeah, I got to be, like, in the...
[10832.05s -> 10833.17s]  I got to be, like, in the main venue.
[10834.21s -> 10837.41s]  I once cured the shingles, and then I realized I could make more money.
[10837.41s -> 10837.97s]  What is this?
[10839.66s -> 10840.16s]  Oh.
[10841.60s -> 10844.00s]  Man, lots of low-flying planes around here.
[10845.97s -> 10847.09s]  Okay, I think it just said, yes.
[10848.05s -> 10849.65s]  Sir, please don't speak with me.
[10849.65s -> 10851.17s]  My therapist recommends I don't talk to you.
[10851.17s -> 10852.05s]  Okay, I have, like, a phone.
[10852.85s -> 10854.21s]  Wait, let me just get the fuck out of here.
[10854.21s -> 10854.77s]  How do I fight?
[10856.26s -> 10857.06s]  Sir, where are you?
[10857.06s -> 10857.56s]  Sir?
[10863.54s -> 10864.10s]  There we go.
[10864.10s -> 10864.58s]  Okay, all right.
[10864.58s -> 10864.82s]  All right.
[10864.82s -> 10865.86s]  It loaded me in, finally.
[10866.50s -> 10866.74s]  All right.
[10866.74s -> 10867.46s]  I'll go find you.
[10868.42s -> 10869.33s]  Watch out.
[10869.33s -> 10870.69s]  I'm going to use my new technique.
[10870.69s -> 10871.57s]  You got a new technique?
[10873.97s -> 10878.00s]  You okay?
[10878.00s -> 10880.88s]  I once cured the shingles, and then I realized I could make more money.
[10880.88s -> 10881.44s]  Oh, no.
[10881.44s -> 10881.92s]  You, uh...
[10882.72s -> 10883.28s]  You want a drink?
[10884.00s -> 10885.31s]  Here, come here.
[10885.31s -> 10885.63s]  Come here.
[10885.63s -> 10886.27s]  Have some of this.
[10886.27s -> 10886.77s]  Yeah.
[10892.35s -> 10895.87s]  This is the most uncomfortable I've done in my life.
[10895.87s -> 10896.37s]  You want some?
[10898.27s -> 10900.19s]  That's my wall.
[10902.66s -> 10903.62s]  Go over here.
[10903.62s -> 10904.12s]  Yes.
[10909.84s -> 10910.72s]  Can you pop that open?
[10911.79s -> 10912.29s]  No.
[10918.67s -> 10919.15s]  All right, come on.
[10919.15s -> 10919.65s]  Ready?
[10920.19s -> 10921.31s]  Oh, they're all coming.
[10921.31s -> 10921.87s]  Behind you.
[10925.63s -> 10926.13s]  What?
[10927.73s -> 10929.73s]  I can't pick myself up.
[10929.73s -> 10931.01s]  How do you pick yourself up?
[10932.45s -> 10934.91s]  The bartender won't serve you down there.
[10934.91s -> 10935.41s]  No, no.
[10935.41s -> 10936.91s]  Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.
[10936.91s -> 10938.11s]  You still alive.
[10938.11s -> 10939.47s]  You're still fine.
[10941.65s -> 10943.17s]  Is that a firecracker?
[10944.05s -> 10945.73s]  Did you shoot a Roman candle?
[10946.29s -> 10947.25s]  There's like...
[10947.25s -> 10948.45s]  There's these whole big...
[10948.45s -> 10950.61s]  I don't know how these are called, but it blew up.
[10953.60s -> 10954.10s]  Whoa!
[10954.40s -> 10955.28s]  Wow, that's so funny.
[10958.99s -> 10959.71s]  Watch out!
[10959.71s -> 10960.59s]  What are you doing?
[10961.15s -> 10961.65s]  Stop!
[10962.51s -> 10963.64s]  Stop it!
[10964.34s -> 10964.84s]  Watch out!
[10965.30s -> 10965.80s]  Watch out!
[10966.10s -> 10979.62s]  I don't understand.
[10980.50s -> 10981.70s]  All right, no more.
[10981.70s -> 10982.82s]  I gotta like pick you up?
[10984.67s -> 10988.11s]  Yeah, if I go down, you can come over and grab me and pull me up.
[10988.11s -> 10988.67s]  All right, hold on.
[10988.67s -> 10989.63s]  Sometimes it works.
[10989.63s -> 10990.43s]  Come here for a second.
[10991.31s -> 10991.81s]  What is this?
[10995.17s -> 10996.05s]  I didn't mean to.
[10996.05s -> 10997.09s]  Look, I'm drunk.
[10997.09s -> 10997.97s]  I want to do something.
[10998.61s -> 10999.73s]  Oh my god!
[10999.73s -> 11000.23s]  Come over here.
[11001.01s -> 11003.31s]  Come over here and uh...
[11003.31s -> 11003.87s]  Come over here and uh...
[11003.87s -> 11004.75s]  Dad, mom, dad, yes.
[11004.75s -> 11005.79s]  You know what I mean? Put your hand here.
[11009.46s -> 11009.96s]  Right?
[11010.18s -> 11011.30s]  My wall's right there.
[11011.30s -> 11012.02s]  Hold on.
[11012.02s -> 11013.54s]  Oh shit, my wall's right there too.
[11014.86s -> 11015.36s]  Ow!
[11016.19s -> 11016.69s]  I can't.
[11017.94s -> 11018.44s]  Right?
[11018.74s -> 11031.01s]  I'm going for the bombs.
[11033.50s -> 11034.94s]  No, don't go for the bombs.
[11035.50s -> 11036.46s]  Get that out of here!
[11036.46s -> 11036.96s]  No!
[11042.19s -> 11045.31s]  Nobody else was even remotely involved.
[11045.31s -> 11046.91s]  No one, no one is bothered.
[11049.47s -> 11050.91s]  Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.
[11050.91s -> 11051.95s]  These two assholes.
[11052.51s -> 11054.03s]  Playing with toys over here.
[11054.03s -> 11055.07s]  Like killing each other.
[11059.04s -> 11059.76s]  All right, okay.
[11060.32s -> 11065.07s]  Did you take pictures?
[11070.64s -> 11079.30s]  How does this work?
[11079.30s -> 11080.02s]  That wasn't very good.
[11081.06s -> 11081.56s]  Excuse me.
[11085.38s -> 11086.34s]  I'm just looking.
[11086.34s -> 11086.84s]  Let's go.
[11086.84s -> 11087.46s]  Come over this way.
[11094.72s -> 11095.76s]  Nobody's talking anymore.
[11095.76s -> 11097.28s]  This is my sister's wedding.
[11097.28s -> 11099.98s]  I give it two years.
[11099.98s -> 11101.18s]  No, no, wait, wait.
[11101.18s -> 11101.68s]  You wait.
[11102.62s -> 11103.18s]  I'm waiting.
[11103.18s -> 11105.74s]  I'm just joining the conversation with my vase that I brought.
[11107.38s -> 11108.26s]  You're trying to like...
[11109.70s -> 11110.82s]  Feed Jeff Bezos.
[11118.19s -> 11121.18s]  This is fucking terrifying.
[11121.18s -> 11122.70s]  It's like up his nose.
[11123.42s -> 11124.22s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11124.22s -> 11125.34s]  I want to see if I can balance it.
[11125.98s -> 11132.00s]  Did you ding him?
[11132.00s -> 11132.56s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[11132.56s -> 11133.12s]  What's he doing?
[11133.84s -> 11137.62s]  Wait, give it a whine.
[11137.62s -> 11139.06s]  Oops.
[11143.54s -> 11144.42s]  Who are we feeding?
[11145.06s -> 11146.69s]  That's fair enough.
[11146.69s -> 11150.00s]  All right, he's a little bit boozed up.
[11152.32s -> 11156.80s]  Perfect timing.
[11169.25s -> 11170.13s]  Easy over there.
[11170.69s -> 11172.99s]  Hey, you enjoyed the wedding?
[11172.99s -> 11174.11s]  You guys enjoyed the wedding?
[11174.11s -> 11175.55s]  Yeah, I love this couple.
[11175.55s -> 11177.15s]  They're so fucking friendly.
[11177.15s -> 11180.59s]  My favorite thing, if you've had the wine yet, it's fantastic.
[11180.59s -> 11182.35s]  Hey, if you don't like the three snooges.
[11182.35s -> 11183.31s]  Oh, come on.
[11183.31s -> 11183.81s]  Damn it.
[11185.31s -> 11186.03s]  Hey, my favorite.
[11186.03s -> 11186.83s]  Oh, what's this?
[11193.06s -> 11195.06s]  Why can't we just sit here for an hour and behave?
[11196.02s -> 11197.22s]  All right, here's the deal.
[11197.22s -> 11197.86s]  You ready for the game?
[11199.41s -> 11199.89s]  Where are you?
[11201.74s -> 11207.31s]  The game is you have to let go of that.
[11208.75s -> 11209.25s]  No.
[11209.87s -> 11210.43s]  Stop it.
[11210.43s -> 11212.43s]  I was just doing fireworks for the party.
[11212.43s -> 11213.71s]  No, you're going to piss people off.
[11214.35s -> 11215.07s]  I'm down?
[11215.07s -> 11215.87s]  I got you, I got you.
[11216.83s -> 11218.99s]  Okay, all right.
[11218.99s -> 11221.71s]  The goal is stand in the...
[11224.98s -> 11225.46s]  What the fuck?
[11226.74s -> 11228.50s]  All right, when you settle down, Kylo Ren.
[11234.10s -> 11234.90s]  Get away from me.
[11235.76s -> 11236.80s]  Get the fuck away from me.
[11249.02s -> 11252.69s]  It's a crab.
[11254.59s -> 11255.55s]  It's going for your legs.
[11256.35s -> 11263.09s]  I'm like the kid in the party.
[11263.09s -> 11265.49s]  Yeah, you're like the annoying little shit
[11266.13s -> 11268.05s]  that's running around and bumping into people.
[11277.36s -> 11279.28s]  Wait, I wonder, can they punch me when I'm down here?
[11279.28s -> 11280.40s]  I'm just chapped right now.
[11281.20s -> 11285.70s]  They just keep punching this lady in the face.
[11290.74s -> 11291.86s]  I'm winning this fight.
[11291.86s -> 11294.74s]  This is bizarre, I'll tell you.
[11295.62s -> 11298.10s]  What about your fucking animals, you know what I'm saying?
[11298.74s -> 11306.58s]  Look at your ankles.
[11322.11s -> 11323.07s]  Nice.
[11323.07s -> 11324.75s]  Get me, get me, get me up, get me up, get me up.
[11324.75s -> 11325.39s]  I'm down.
[11325.39s -> 11326.83s]  Oh, turn, quick, quick, quick.
[11327.71s -> 11328.27s]  Over here.
[11329.15s -> 11329.63s]  They're coming.
[11335.10s -> 11335.74s]  How do you win?
[11337.42s -> 11337.90s]  Do you win?
[11338.70s -> 11339.50s]  I don't think you win.
[11340.22s -> 11341.02s]  Wait, hold on a second.
[11341.02s -> 11342.62s]  Don't hurt anybody, just give me move people.
[11345.14s -> 11346.58s]  I want to throw someone off the roof.
[11349.30s -> 11357.66s]  Fuck, help me.
[11358.46s -> 11359.50s]  I'm down, I'm down.
[11360.30s -> 11362.21s]  I'm down, lift me up.
[11367.06s -> 11369.09s]  I won't serve you down there.
[11369.09s -> 11370.61s]  Maybe next time you should put yourself out there.
[11370.61s -> 11371.41s]  What are you doing?
[11371.41s -> 11373.97s]  I thought you of all people would appreciate a double middle finger.
[11373.97s -> 11375.01s]  Oh, that's what you were doing?
[11375.73s -> 11376.05s]  Yeah.
[11377.01s -> 11386.22s]  Hey, what do you got to say about these?
[11387.42s -> 11396.86s]  Wait, stop.
[11396.86s -> 11410.91s]  DJ plays goodbye horses.
[11410.91s -> 11412.51s]  That's my favorite song to dance to.
[11413.39s -> 11417.26s]  Hey, hey, excuse me.
[11421.18s -> 11427.57s]  He tried to run off the roof.
[11427.57s -> 11440.51s]  Hey, hey, I'm down.
[11440.67s -> 11443.62s]  Help, get me.
[11447.17s -> 11447.73s]  Nice.
[11453.97s -> 11455.17s]  I can get myself up?
[11456.85s -> 11458.77s]  Why can I not take a single punch to the face?
[11459.81s -> 11460.45s]  All right, that's it.
[11462.94s -> 11464.80s]  All right, come over here.
[11464.80s -> 11465.20s]  Come with me.
[11465.20s -> 11465.76s]  Don't hurt anybody.
[11465.76s -> 11466.08s]  Get over here.
[11468.08s -> 11469.20s]  Okay, here's the deal.
[11469.20s -> 11470.40s]  I'm going to go on.
[11470.40s -> 11471.92s]  I'm going to get support his body.
[11472.56s -> 11473.52s]  You support his legs.
[11474.16s -> 11477.20s]  We're going to one, two, three, throw them over the edge.
[11479.04s -> 11479.84s]  Hold on, stay there.
[11481.44s -> 11483.92s]  Okay, so you don't like that the practical is wrong, but you kneel behind.
[11485.04s -> 11485.52s]  Yeah, yeah.
[11485.52s -> 11485.84s]  You ready?
[11489.28s -> 11489.76s]  Ready?
[11489.76s -> 11492.08s]  Here, he's kind of come up with his legs up.
[11496.00s -> 11497.39s]  It's like grabbing him.
[11510.37s -> 11511.17s]  Where are you?
[11511.17s -> 11523.17s]  So, you know there's a Halloween version of this game too, right?
[11524.45s -> 11527.97s]  I'm sure it changed the game dramatically.
[11528.53s -> 11532.06s]  It's going to be 300k in a month.
[11532.06s -> 11534.30s]  I piss 300k daily.
[11534.30s -> 11536.67s]  My face is as high as I'm supposed to win.
[11548.54s -> 11553.90s]  Is that Gilford Godfrey?
[11554.86s -> 11555.65s]  It sounds like him.
[11555.65s -> 11556.69s]  Is that Dry Bear?
[11556.69s -> 11558.21s]  It does sound like Godfrey.
[11558.21s -> 11559.33s]  Gilford Godfrey.
[11559.33s -> 11560.13s]  Gilford Godfrey.
[11560.13s -> 11560.69s]  I got him.
[11560.69s -> 11561.49s]  I got him.
[11561.49s -> 11561.73s]  No.
[11562.45s -> 11563.09s]  What, you got him?
[11564.05s -> 11565.09s]  He almost went off.
[11578.66s -> 11579.62s]  It's really like this.
[11580.74s -> 11582.42s]  All right, I'll take two more of these.
[11583.38s -> 11590.78s]  This guy's hanging on for his life.
[11591.58s -> 11598.98s]  I'm done.
[11598.98s -> 11599.46s]  I'm dead.
[11599.94s -> 11600.66s]  I'm dead.
[11600.66s -> 11601.22s]  I died.
[11608.70s -> 11611.50s]  It's just the same shit over and over again.
[11611.50s -> 11612.06s]  But it's-
[11612.06s -> 11614.06s]  Yeah, so how about that desert buzz?
[11614.06s -> 11614.46s]  I know.
[11614.46s -> 11615.74s]  How about desert buzz, huh?
[11619.82s -> 11620.94s]  Hey, actually, you know what?
[11620.94s -> 11622.06s]  We need to do the 1v1.
[11623.02s -> 11623.98s]  1v1 here?
[11624.70s -> 11625.18s]  Yeah.
[11625.18s -> 11625.82s]  All right, fine.
[11626.54s -> 11633.82s]  It's all about the intimidation factor, guys.
[11636.82s -> 11637.06s]  How do I-
[11637.06s -> 11639.22s]  Can I turn my body without turning-
[11640.02s -> 11641.30s]  I don't think I can.
[11641.86s -> 11642.10s]  No.
[11648.38s -> 11649.74s]  Hey, you want to see what I got?
[11649.74s -> 11651.82s]  Hey, hey, come at me.
[11651.82s -> 11652.62s]  You want to come at me?
[11652.62s -> 11653.66s]  Are you scared now?
[11653.66s -> 11654.30s]  Intimidated?
[11654.30s -> 11655.42s]  How about I do it again, huh?
[11664.99s -> 11665.31s]  Hey.
[11686.54s -> 11688.86s]  You just brought me back to life.
[11688.86s -> 11689.82s]  Big mistake.
[11690.94s -> 11697.09s]  Are you down?
[11709.55s -> 11711.23s]  Okay, I have a headache.
[11711.23s -> 11711.95s]  Yeah, I do too.
[11712.75s -> 11714.13s]  I have a fucking bad headache.
[11715.54s -> 11717.46s]  All right, we got to get everybody.
[11717.46s -> 11717.86s]  You ready?
[11719.06s -> 11721.38s]  Oh, I have a headache means we're getting everybody.
[11721.38s -> 11722.50s]  Well, then we should be throwing bombs.
[11724.10s -> 11724.98s]  All right, stop, stop, stop.
[11724.98s -> 11725.38s]  Wait, stop, stop.
[11725.38s -> 11725.86s]  Slow down, slow down.
[11725.86s -> 11726.74s]  We got to get this slow down.
[11729.81s -> 11730.21s]  Easy.
[11732.94s -> 11734.06s]  Are these candles?
[11734.78s -> 11738.13s]  No, these are the bombs.
[11738.77s -> 11741.09s]  Make sure they're not like shaky toys.
[11742.45s -> 11742.93s]  I'm sure.
[11743.57s -> 11743.89s]  Okay.
[11744.61s -> 11744.93s]  Ready?
[11745.81s -> 11748.22s]  How about-
[11748.22s -> 11749.50s]  What's the fuse time?
[11749.50s -> 11749.98s]  Oh, God.
[11749.98s -> 11753.58s]  I'm seizing them.
[11753.58s -> 11754.30s]  I'm allergic.
[11755.10s -> 11762.56s]  The bartender won't serve you down there.
[11762.56s -> 11764.80s]  I can't even believe you survived until 40.
[11777.26s -> 11778.78s]  And then I realized I can make more money.
[11794.59s -> 11794.91s]  What?
[11794.91s -> 11795.87s]  I just fell over?
[11799.63s -> 11802.59s]  This really quickly went from bar fight to acts of terrorism.
[11815.90s -> 11817.26s]  Why am I getting switched?
[11819.63s -> 11821.55s]  On my screen, I'm standing on top of you.
[11821.95s -> 11829.87s]  I snuck up here and sabotaged this place
[11829.87s -> 11831.71s]  since they're stealing all the customers from my-
[11856.88s -> 11857.60s]  God damn it.
[11858.32s -> 11859.52s]  What are you doing?
[11859.52s -> 11860.88s]  I'm fucking sitting down, man.
[11860.88s -> 11862.32s]  I'm going to fucking pass out.
[11863.78s -> 11864.74s]  Looking up at your face.
[11866.75s -> 11867.47s]  So fucking-
[11875.62s -> 11876.98s]  It's not like this is not-
[11876.98s -> 11877.46s]  I don't know.
[11877.46s -> 11877.78s]  My-
[11877.78s -> 11878.42s]  Something's-
[11878.42s -> 11879.30s]  Okay, where am I?
[11880.02s -> 11881.38s]  Guys, I understand something.
[11882.18s -> 11883.71s]  I didn't do this.
[11884.67s -> 11887.17s]  This was another reason why I was laughing.
[11889.66s -> 11890.86s]  What am I doing on your screen?
[11892.18s -> 11894.10s]  Your arms are crossed like this.
[11894.10s -> 11894.74s]  They shouldn't be.
[11895.86s -> 11898.77s]  Are you holding the wrong controller?
[11898.77s -> 11900.61s]  No, I got the straps on.
[11902.88s -> 11905.60s]  There's no way that my hands came out of the straps,
[11906.40s -> 11907.52s]  through the other straps.
[11908.86s -> 11909.34s]  No way.
[11910.06s -> 11914.53s]  That could not have happened, right?
[11915.09s -> 11916.37s]  There's no way on the ground.
[11918.80s -> 11919.20s]  I don't-
[11919.20s -> 11920.08s]  No, that's impossible.
[11949.84s -> 11951.60s]  Don't ask me, I have no idea.
[11951.60s -> 11952.40s]  No, that makes no sense,
[11952.40s -> 11953.44s]  because look, this is my left hand.
[11954.56s -> 11955.04s]  You understand?
[11955.04s -> 11955.92s]  This is the left hand.
[11985.50s -> 11995.14s]  Are you still alive?
[11998.54s -> 12000.54s]  The bartender won't serve you down there.
[12000.54s -> 12002.30s]  Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.
[12002.30s -> 12002.86s]  I didn't see-
[12004.86s -> 12006.14s]  My daddy's on bitcoin.
[12006.14s -> 12009.18s]  He's gotta be worth 300,000 dollars in about two months.
[12009.82s -> 12011.26s]  All right, how do we get out of here?
[12013.02s -> 12013.66s]  How do we get out?
[12020.00s -> 12020.80s]  Oh my god.
[12021.60s -> 12023.20s]  What if we gotta get the cake?
[12024.00s -> 12032.72s]  How do we get the cake?
[12038.06s -> 12038.62s]  Real helpful.
[12048.54s -> 12049.02s]  Bankrupted.
[12056.16s -> 12057.92s]  I honestly don't even know how you're doing that.
[12065.46s -> 12070.48s]  Can you grab my hands?
[12089.22s -> 12091.06s]  Bring me the candle.
[12091.86s -> 12093.12s]  Bring me the candle.
[12094.00s -> 12097.17s]  This is how I want to go.
[12097.17s -> 12097.89s]  No, you dropped it.
[12097.89s -> 12098.39s]  Come here.
[12101.44s -> 12108.85s]  I want to eat it, I want to eat it.
[12108.85s -> 12109.73s]  Oh, I'm up.
[12109.73s -> 12110.59s]  I'm up.
[12110.59s -> 12111.79s]  This is what a beat up looks like.
[12112.99s -> 12127.02s]  Can we beat one level, please?
[12129.12s -> 12129.76s]  I got him.
[12138.88s -> 12139.60s]  You don't win.
[12141.52s -> 12142.88s]  It's a metaphor.
[12147.63s -> 12148.19s]  Give me the knife.
[12150.24s -> 12150.96s]  Excuse me?
[12151.52s -> 12152.48s]  I'm not doing that.
[12154.40s -> 12154.96s]  What?
[12154.96s -> 12155.84s]  Why did it do that?
[12164.61s -> 12170.40s]  Hey, you want a pickle?
[12170.40s -> 12171.36s]  Oh no, there's a wine.
[12172.86s -> 12173.58s]  I got you, I got you, I got you.
[12178.05s -> 12179.25s]  Will you please get up?
[12180.29s -> 12180.79s]  No.
[12197.57s -> 12201.17s]  Brother!
[12201.17s -> 12202.86s]  Could you?
[12202.86s -> 12205.74s]  You're just causing me so much fucking anguish.
[12208.05s -> 12216.24s]  Protect me.
[12221.09s -> 12221.81s]  I read it one.
[12243.97s -> 12245.17s]  I'm exhausted.
[12246.05s -> 12247.17s]  I'm exhausted.
[12250.32s -> 12252.56s]  Let me help you, let me help you, let me help you, let me help you, let me help you.
[12253.28s -> 12253.92s]  Give me the- wait.
[12256.48s -> 12256.96s]  You're back.
[12257.68s -> 12279.76s]  Slowly taking care of this guy.
[12279.76s -> 12281.26s]  Are you still alive?
[12282.34s -> 12282.82s]  I'm good.
[12283.94s -> 12288.94s]  I find you.
[12291.07s -> 12291.79s]  Oh shit.
[12293.81s -> 12298.26s]  What, this guy's dancing?
[12302.94s -> 12305.26s]  This guy's still getting hit by a lag.
[12305.90s -> 12308.45s]  How did you get him down there?
[12308.69s -> 12309.73s]  You're a monster.
[12320.59s -> 12325.90s]  I think somebody just blew his ass in the game.
[12328.94s -> 12329.90s]  I gotta get a bribe.
[12331.04s -> 12332.08s]  Just keep him distracted.
[12332.88s -> 12337.17s]  Just keep him distracted.
[12337.89s -> 12338.53s]  What?
[12342.14s -> 12342.64s]  Hey.
[12343.34s -> 12345.42s]  Hey, um, what do I mean?
[12348.10s -> 12349.46s]  It closed the helicopter.
[12352.58s -> 12356.96s]  I'm so bad.
[12357.52s -> 12359.78s]  What the fuck?
[12360.18s -> 12361.46s]  Give me this whole toaster.
[12361.46s -> 12364.00s]  What the fuck?
[12364.00s -> 12368.64s]  I'm so bad.
[12368.64s -> 12369.52s]  What the fuck?
[12369.52s -> 12379.65s]  Give me this whole toaster.
[12379.65s -> 12381.34s]  What the fuck?
[12381.34s -> 12382.38s]  Give me this whole toaster.
[12387.09s -> 12394.24s]  Oh shit.
[12396.59s -> 12397.07s]  Come on.
[12422.74s -> 12424.50s]  That's the sound you want to hear in VR.
[12425.46s -> 12426.75s]  But where are you?
[12433.81s -> 12449.31s]  I can't get out of here.
[12450.05s -> 12451.01s]  I can't get out, guys.
[12451.01s -> 12451.73s]  I cannot leave.
[12454.19s -> 12455.47s]  Somebody just- okay.
[12455.47s -> 12456.99s]  All right, it's time to stand up.
[12456.99s -> 12457.71s]  It's time to stand up.
[12457.71s -> 12458.19s]  You know why?
[12458.75s -> 12460.59s]  Somebody just said 33-year-old.
[12461.55s -> 12462.67s]  I gotta get up.
[12462.67s -> 12463.47s]  I have to stand up.
[12465.23s -> 12466.43s]  I gotta delete this VOD.
[12467.23s -> 12468.35s]  That's all you need to say.
[12469.23s -> 12471.76s]  All right, I'm getting up.
[12471.76s -> 12473.12s]  I have to delete the VOD.
[12473.76s -> 12475.28s]  I'm gonna delete this VOD, okay?
[12476.00s -> 12479.68s]  What are you doing?
[12480.83s -> 12481.47s]  Me?
[12481.47s -> 12482.19s]  Am I alive?
[12482.91s -> 12483.15s]  What?
[12483.15s -> 12483.95s]  I thought I was dead.
[12486.10s -> 12487.70s]  Oh, now I'm in trouble.
[12487.70s -> 12488.10s]  Quick, help.
[12489.46s -> 12492.93s]  I'm out.
[12493.97s -> 12500.18s]  That's not a real table.
[12501.14s -> 12501.86s]  Is he- where are you?
[12501.86s -> 12502.42s]  Are you gone?
[12502.42s -> 12502.92s]  You here?
[12505.43s -> 12505.93s]  Bye.
[12505.93s -> 12506.43s]  I left.
[12509.62s -> 12510.74s]  Totally wasted.
[12514.28s -> 12516.52s]  I think we all hear voices in our heads sometimes.
[12522.87s -> 12524.47s]  Subverting expectations!
[12537.75s -> 12538.87s]  33-year-old.
[12547.11s -> 12553.94s]  The bartender won't serve you down there.
[12553.94s -> 12554.50s]  Maybe next time-
[12554.50s -> 12556.34s]  All right, you ready to take a bus?
[12557.06s -> 12558.58s]  Yeah, let's get on the bus.
[12558.58s -> 12559.86s]  Let's get on the bus.
[12560.02s -> 12563.38s]  I could use a relaxing 8-hour drive to soothe my headache.
[12568.10s -> 12569.46s]  Only drink at rooftop bars.
[12569.46s -> 12570.58s]  Even if it's the dead of winter.
[12603.73s -> 12606.72s]  Okay, uh, you wanna take-
[12606.72s -> 12607.20s]  Oh, I gotta-
[12610.31s -> 12610.81s]  What?
[12613.11s -> 12614.15s]  You're gonna get on a bus?
[12616.02s -> 12617.14s]  Yeah, I'm launching it.
[12617.14s -> 12619.22s]  All right, how do I do it from my, like, home?
[12619.22s -> 12619.70s]  Studio?
[12622.98s -> 12623.94s]  I don't know.
[12623.94s -> 12624.74s]  Oh my god.
[12633.86s -> 12635.06s]  Oh god, it's so loud.
[12637.11s -> 12638.07s]  Click on it?
[12638.07s -> 12639.20s]  It's not up here.
[12650.92s -> 12651.96s]  Like, library?
[12651.96s -> 12656.29s]  No, no, where's my library?
[12656.29s -> 12661.17s]  Get out of this shit.
[12672.24s -> 12674.48s]  Open the Steam menu and go to the VR?
[12674.48s -> 12674.98s]  Yeah, yeah.
[12675.84s -> 12678.04s]  How do I get the fuck out of this?
[12681.22s -> 12681.72s]  Vive?
[12682.34s -> 12685.04s]  No, I don't know how to launch a Vive port.
[12691.14s -> 12691.86s]  Oh, my hands.
[12692.42s -> 12694.10s]  Oh, I gotta fucking put my face out of this.
[12695.38s -> 12696.18s]  Oh my god.
[12698.08s -> 12699.36s]  I gotta change the title anyways.
[12709.75s -> 12711.11s]  Desert bus-
[12711.11s -> 12713.43s]  I'm getting a chair if we're doing desert bus.
[12713.43s -> 12714.95s]  You don't stand and drive a bus.
[12715.75s -> 12716.71s]  I'm standing.
[12716.71s -> 12718.23s]  Are you standing for 8 hours?
[12718.23s -> 12718.95s]  You gonna do that?
[12718.95s -> 12719.27s]  Yeah.
[12719.51s -> 12720.71s]  You sure about that?
[12720.71s -> 12722.23s]  8 hours, I'll go back on the ground.
[12724.04s -> 12725.24s]  Yeah, stand for 8 hours.
[12725.24s -> 12728.20s]  It's a great idea.
[12728.20s -> 12729.80s]  Oh man, that's fucking funny.
[12730.36s -> 12737.70s]  All right, let's do it.
[12737.70s -> 12738.82s]  I'm gonna load into-
[12739.78s -> 12744.21s]  Let me get a sip of my not-sponsored can of dry.
[12744.21s -> 12753.38s]  Go do this and get prepared.
[12753.38s -> 12754.10s]  Go use the bathroom.
[12754.10s -> 12754.66s]  We'll switch off.
[12756.08s -> 12757.44s]  Funny time when you're on the bus.
[12758.68s -> 12761.49s]  Yeah, we'll be fine.
[12761.49s -> 12762.29s]  Pee before the trip.
[12762.29s -> 12767.36s]  We're gonna be fine.
[12767.36s -> 12768.32s]  Okay, opening it up.
[12768.32s -> 12769.76s]  This is how easy this is to do.
[12769.76s -> 12772.95s]  I have no idea how to do a game.
[12779.51s -> 12781.11s]  I have to open the steam VR.
[12781.11s -> 12783.67s]  Launch desert bus directly in steam VR mode.
[12784.87s -> 12785.37s]  Okay.
[12787.51s -> 12788.23s]  I think it's working.
[12789.62s -> 12790.82s]  You look like you've been through hell.
[12791.54s -> 12793.30s]  Kind of have.
[12794.12s -> 12795.16s]  That's what it feels like.
[12809.99s -> 12813.11s]  Who knew that a fucking funny YouTuber game was gonna be so funny?
[12814.79s -> 12816.45s]  I'm gonna drop this volume.
[12826.79s -> 12832.15s]  So, people are saying that we need to go take a pee break,
[12832.15s -> 12832.87s]  but I don't believe them.
[12832.87s -> 12833.67s]  We can switch off.
[12834.95s -> 12835.43s]  I'm good.
[12835.43s -> 12836.07s]  I'm in the game.
[12836.07s -> 12836.87s]  You want to drive?
[12836.87s -> 12837.51s]  You want me to drive?
[12840.31s -> 12841.73s]  You can take first shift.
[12841.73s -> 12842.45s]  It's so filthy in here.
[12843.17s -> 12847.57s]  I don't know how to get together in a game, though.
[12847.57s -> 12848.05s]  Dude, hold on.
[12848.05s -> 12848.85s]  I gotta clean this.
[12848.85s -> 12851.41s]  It is filthy in there.
[12852.13s -> 12852.61s]  Filthy.
[12853.17s -> 12856.26s]  It's like, okay, somebody like came in my room
[12856.26s -> 12859.94s]  and put peanut butter in my vibe headset as a prank.
[12860.90s -> 12864.53s]  That's how ridiculous this looks.
[12865.17s -> 12871.12s]  This is sweat from sweat.
[12871.12s -> 12872.00s]  Yeah, I figured it out.
[12872.00s -> 12873.28s]  I'm gonna throw in the fucking laundry.
[12875.11s -> 12876.31s]  Oh, man.
[12876.31s -> 12889.70s]  Did I buy a face pad yet?
[12889.70s -> 12890.58s]  Uh, not yet.
[12891.38s -> 12899.08s]  Hey, start.
[12899.08s -> 12901.64s]  Let me know when you need me to tell you what to do.
[12901.64s -> 12902.44s]  I just wanted you to know.
[12903.16s -> 12903.80s]  Oh, God.
[12904.60s -> 12906.45s]  It was very fun.
[12907.25s -> 12907.97s]  Hope you know that.
[12907.97s -> 12908.93s]  Before we get to Vegas.
[12909.49s -> 12911.88s]  All right, I got the wrong answer.
[12916.53s -> 12916.85s]  All right.
[12919.84s -> 12921.44s]  So, Tucson city limits.
[12922.40s -> 12925.06s]  So, how do we get this going?
[12926.61s -> 12929.89s]  Uh, the top right lever, pull that down,
[12930.69s -> 12931.81s]  and the card will come out.
[12932.45s -> 12933.73s]  And then you'll search for a game.
[12934.93s -> 12936.85s]  Okay, do I have to get any parameters
[12936.85s -> 12938.13s]  or can we join each other?
[12938.13s -> 12939.17s]  I have no idea.
[12939.17s -> 12939.81s]  I'm in a game.
[12940.61s -> 12942.13s]  You're in a game-found joining.
[12943.01s -> 12945.17s]  Okay, it's definitely mine.
[12945.17s -> 12945.49s]  Is it?
[12947.73s -> 12948.69s]  Oh, I can hear you.
[12949.49s -> 12953.22s]  I'm gonna turn off Discord probably.
[12953.94s -> 12963.89s]  Are you in here?
[12964.77s -> 12967.59s]  Hello?
[12968.39s -> 12971.60s]  Are these other people in here?
[12972.32s -> 12972.56s]  Yeah.
[12973.44s -> 12983.80s]  Um, can you come to the front?
[12983.80s -> 12985.08s]  I can't come to the front.
[12985.08s -> 12985.96s]  I'm all the way back here.
[12986.92s -> 12987.96s]  You can't stand up?
[12991.35s -> 12995.83s]  No, because I, uh, I don't have a driver's license
[12995.83s -> 12997.51s]  and I have no idea how to do this.
[12998.07s -> 12999.03s]  Uh, we might have to...
[13005.24s -> 13006.76s]  Can we make, like, a separate game?
[13007.56s -> 13014.58s]  All right, here we go.
[13015.22s -> 13022.96s]  How do I...
[13022.96s -> 13023.20s]  Okay.
[13029.64s -> 13030.20s]  Oh, you can...
[13030.20s -> 13030.76s]  I can leave.
[13032.47s -> 13033.51s]  Why are you leaving?
[13033.51s -> 13034.15s]  Hey, you!
[13034.15s -> 13034.71s]  Hey, you!
[13034.71s -> 13036.15s]  How do I get up there?
[13036.15s -> 13040.69s]  Like, go like this?
[13041.25s -> 13059.06s]  I can't.
[13059.70s -> 13067.72s]  What the hell is this?
[13068.61s -> 13069.89s]  Are you driving the car?
[13070.95s -> 13071.67s]  Yeah.
[13071.67s -> 13080.96s]  He's just throwing something at me.
[13083.35s -> 13083.75s]  Teacher!
[13084.74s -> 13086.34s]  Teacher, he's throwing stuff at me!
[13091.43s -> 13092.95s]  You can't switch drivers.
[13092.95s -> 13096.95s]  Oh, I can't even walk back here.
[13106.52s -> 13112.52s]  Okay, um, this is it.
[13119.73s -> 13120.77s]  Turn on the radio.
[13120.77s -> 13121.49s]  Turn on the radio.
[13142.16s -> 13148.44s]  Sir, sir, this is not how you drive.
[13148.44s -> 13149.72s]  I'm gonna fall down in real life.
[13150.28s -> 13158.69s]  There's this thing that keeps making my controllers
[13158.69s -> 13160.77s]  vibrate, like, harder than I've ever felt.
[13161.92s -> 13162.96s]  It's concerning me.
[13163.68s -> 13165.04s]  I don't know what this is.
[13165.04s -> 13167.04s]  This is more of a dare than a game.
[13167.04s -> 13168.24s]  It's supposed to be terrible.
[13169.12s -> 13176.04s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[13176.04s -> 13179.84s]  Okay, you know what?
[13179.84s -> 13181.86s]  What?
[13181.86s -> 13183.22s]  Why do you have the police siren?
[13183.22s -> 13191.94s]  Uh, uh, I think we're getting towed.
[13191.94s -> 13194.08s]  What?
[13194.08s -> 13197.56s]  What do you mean we're getting towed?
[13199.40s -> 13200.12s]  You're a...
[13200.12s -> 13201.40s]  You're a toad!
[13201.40s -> 13212.52s]  You're not driving backwards right now?
[13212.52s -> 13213.32s]  I'm not driving...
[13213.32s -> 13214.84s]  No, we're getting towed backwards
[13214.84s -> 13219.41s]  because I drove off the road.
[13219.41s -> 13221.01s]  Oh, my spleen just hurts.
[13221.73s -> 13224.93s]  And this is back to the beginning.
[13224.93s -> 13226.85s]  This tow truck is going like 90.
[13227.73s -> 13241.44s]  Can you at least put on music for us?
[13242.40s -> 13243.12s]  I left.
[13244.80s -> 13247.11s]  Here, you drive.
[13247.91s -> 13248.39s]  Me?
[13248.39s -> 13249.35s]  How is that possible?
[13249.35s -> 13249.99s]  How do I drive?
[13250.55s -> 13251.83s]  You have to get back to the menu.
[13252.55s -> 13252.87s]  Okay.
[13253.75s -> 13256.18s]  How do I pick drive car?
[13258.90s -> 13260.02s]  Uh, tell me when you're there.
[13261.68s -> 13265.44s]  Oh, you take the time card out of the green box
[13265.44s -> 13267.76s]  and you put it on top of the time card clock box,
[13267.76s -> 13268.40s]  the clock in.
[13269.36s -> 13272.44s]  You don't draw pictures.
[13273.16s -> 13277.33s]  Oh, the other card.
[13277.33s -> 13277.89s]  Doofus.
[13278.53s -> 13279.01s]  This one?
[13279.65s -> 13282.04s]  No, put it in the top of the green box.
[13282.60s -> 13286.52s]  This guy has never gone to work one day in his life.
[13302.47s -> 13302.97s]  Boo!
[13304.29s -> 13305.09s]  Are you coming in?
[13306.45s -> 13307.57s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[13307.57s -> 13308.96s]  Where are you?
[13308.96s -> 13309.52s]  Which one are you?
[13310.48s -> 13311.12s]  I'm loading.
[13315.64s -> 13317.96s]  I'm three seats back right behind you.
[13317.96s -> 13318.52s]  Waving.
[13318.52s -> 13319.02s]  Hey!
[13319.80s -> 13320.30s]  Hey!
[13321.41s -> 13322.85s]  Okay, guys, be good.
[13323.73s -> 13329.62s]  Let's get a bit of radio station on here.
[13329.62s -> 13335.52s]  How do I change the radio?
[13336.80s -> 13340.37s]  Yeah, good luck with that.
[13341.09s -> 13352.77s]  How fast can you go?
[13355.97s -> 13356.77s]  About this fast.
[13361.35s -> 13363.99s]  Oh, that's you hitting the tires on the side.
[13363.99s -> 13364.47s]  What?
[13364.47s -> 13365.35s]  That's what that is.
[13366.15s -> 13384.18s]  What does this do?
[13385.54s -> 13390.72s]  What is this?
[13390.72s -> 13391.76s]  Is this the radio?
[13391.76s -> 13392.96s]  How do I change the station?
[13398.39s -> 13400.39s]  Get down from there, this instant!
[13400.39s -> 13403.44s]  Behind the yellow line.
[13403.44s -> 13409.54s]  You gotta tell your mother about that.
[13409.54s -> 13413.33s]  That's gonna be in my write-up.
[13413.33s -> 13414.13s]  Fucking asshole.
[13414.77s -> 13416.79s]  Just walk through the window.
[13417.51s -> 13418.80s]  All right, I'm out.
[13426.87s -> 13427.37s]  Already?
[13428.31s -> 13437.22s]  We did it in the last one minute.
[13438.90s -> 13439.46s]  No, we didn't.
[13439.46s -> 13440.50s]  We didn't last one minute.
[13440.50s -> 13442.42s]  I thought we'd at least be able to walk around the bus.
[13443.30s -> 13445.43s]  Yeah, it didn't last a minute.
[13445.43s -> 13446.63s]  Sign in to restart state.
[13446.63s -> 13447.35s]  No, no, no.
[13447.35s -> 13448.15s]  That's not what we're doing.
[13450.16s -> 13451.12s]  You want to do table tennis?
[13453.89s -> 13455.33s]  Or are you like tapped out?
[13458.00s -> 13461.20s]  Let's do it because we're only going to do it for like five minutes anyway.
[13461.20s -> 13461.70s]  Probably.
[13462.32s -> 13467.89s]  I'm not sure how you can group with people.
[13469.92s -> 13471.57s]  I guess we'll have to find out.
[13477.65s -> 13478.85s]  Eight hour stream.
[13479.57s -> 13481.97s]  Oh yeah, that was a good eight hours in there.
[13482.53s -> 13485.36s]  Within the last fucking 15 seconds.
[13486.00s -> 13489.78s]  Is this game good?
[13491.25s -> 13491.89s]  Yeah.
[13491.89s -> 13492.93s]  Is it? Okay.
[13492.93s -> 13498.79s]  You need an entire dedicated weekend for Desert Bus.
[13499.43s -> 13504.61s]  Yeah, I can't believe we finished the whole thing either.
[13504.61s -> 13505.73s]  That was ridiculous.
[13505.73s -> 13506.85s]  We made it all the way to Vegas.
[13507.41s -> 13507.97s]  It's pretty cool.
[13508.53s -> 13510.36s]  All right, let's open it.
[13510.36s -> 13511.72s]  This is like squishing my eyes.
[13512.52s -> 13515.28s]  All right, this should be opening.
[13523.83s -> 13526.95s]  Drunken bar fight.
[13526.95s -> 13527.35s]  Killed me.
[13530.87s -> 13532.15s]  Joel beat Desert Bus?
[13533.28s -> 13533.68s]  He's good.
[13534.32s -> 13536.02s]  He's made out of steel.
[13536.74s -> 13542.58s]  Made out of incredible balls.
[13544.39s -> 13545.59s]  Why am I already fighting somebody?
[13548.00s -> 13549.04s]  Who is this?
[13549.60s -> 13551.27s]  Is this tutorial?
[13551.27s -> 13552.07s]  I don't get it.
[13552.07s -> 13553.19s]  That's tutorial plot.
[13555.40s -> 13556.21s]  Okay.
[13556.85s -> 13558.55s]  This looks kind of good.
[13558.55s -> 13559.67s]  This looks like it could be a lot of fun.
[13560.88s -> 13564.80s]  It is actually very, very well physics simulation.
[13564.80s -> 13565.60s]  Very well good.
[13566.32s -> 13566.64s]  Okay.
[13566.64s -> 13567.92s]  If you press the menu button.
[13568.56s -> 13572.21s]  There should be a multiplayer.
[13572.21s -> 13573.57s]  I've never done the multiplayer.
[13581.89s -> 13583.73s]  You're going to have to go real easy on me, man.
[13584.71s -> 13586.31s]  Yeah, well, I'm trying to...
[13587.03s -> 13588.07s]  Are you Tommy Pickles?
[13588.71s -> 13589.03s]  Yes.
[13589.75s -> 13594.10s]  I sent you a challenge that I think shows up on your right.
[13595.72s -> 13596.36s]  It does.
[13596.36s -> 13597.16s]  How do I say yes?
[13598.92s -> 13599.72s]  I'm not sure.
[13599.72s -> 13600.28s]  Okay.
[13600.28s -> 13601.00s]  All right.
[13601.00s -> 13603.96s]  Also, if you want it to, like if you go to your computer.
[13603.96s -> 13605.24s]  I'm not that tall.
[13607.17s -> 13607.73s]  I am.
[13607.73s -> 13608.93s]  Not that tall.
[13609.57s -> 13614.02s]  You're almost as tall as the top of the staircase.
[13614.74s -> 13616.05s]  This is my life.
[13616.77s -> 13619.11s]  All right.
[13619.11s -> 13619.91s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13619.91s -> 13621.03s]  This is very important.
[13621.03s -> 13621.59s]  Okay.
[13621.59s -> 13622.15s]  Very important.
[13622.15s -> 13624.23s]  So you go back to the menu and go to settings.
[13628.74s -> 13629.14s]  Settings.
[13630.58s -> 13632.90s]  People are going to throw up if you use first person cam,
[13632.90s -> 13634.02s]  but you can like make it.
[13635.92s -> 13637.12s]  I don't know what the option is.
[13638.56s -> 13639.52s]  In game positioning.
[13641.48s -> 13643.32s]  Go to the eyeball, the top middle.
[13643.32s -> 13645.40s]  Do you have spectator camera?
[13646.28s -> 13647.88s]  Spectator camera.
[13647.88s -> 13648.12s]  Yeah.
[13648.12s -> 13649.32s]  The eyeball at the top middle.
[13649.32s -> 13649.96s]  Yeah.
[13649.96s -> 13651.72s]  So enable the spectator camera.
[13652.52s -> 13652.76s]  Yeah.
[13653.32s -> 13653.72s]  It's already on.
[13653.72s -> 13656.12s]  Because if you're in first person mode, people will throw up.
[13656.12s -> 13657.32s]  It's like 50 field of view.
[13658.36s -> 13658.76s]  Okay.
[13658.76s -> 13660.60s]  Well, enable spectator camera is checked.
[13663.27s -> 13664.47s]  It's definitely is first person.
[13665.43s -> 13666.15s]  Uncheck it?
[13667.43s -> 13668.07s]  How does this look?
[13673.25s -> 13674.37s]  Uncheck spectator?
[13674.37s -> 13674.69s]  All right.
[13674.69s -> 13674.85s]  No.
[13675.97s -> 13680.34s]  That's fine.
[13680.90s -> 13682.10s]  It looks all right.
[13682.82s -> 13691.49s]  Wait, how do you get the funny mask?
[13692.72s -> 13694.16s]  There's the funny mask option.
[13694.16s -> 13694.40s]  What?
[13704.45s -> 13707.72s]  Uh, yeah, I don't know how to change it because normally you can like
[13707.72s -> 13709.24s]  pull the camera to anywhere you want.
[13709.24s -> 13709.48s]  Whoops.
[13709.48s -> 13710.28s]  I hit my mic.
[13710.28s -> 13710.52s]  Yeah.
[13710.52s -> 13711.72s]  You smashed your mic.
[13717.75s -> 13718.15s]  All right.
[13718.15s -> 13719.83s]  I'm ready to just do a little volley here.
[13720.55s -> 13721.03s]  Hold on.
[13721.03s -> 13722.31s]  My sound is like zero.
[13723.03s -> 13723.75s]  One second.
[13731.43s -> 13732.71s]  This does feel really good though.
[13733.35s -> 13742.95s]  You don't even need a ping pong table.
[13742.95s -> 13744.23s]  Just return the one that you bought.
[13759.38s -> 13760.18s]  Oh, yeah.
[13761.14s -> 13761.94s]  Oh, yeah.
[13764.36s -> 13764.84s]  Ah!
[13764.84s -> 13779.14s]  I didn't even tell me I was getting that close.
[13779.14s -> 13779.78s]  That was bad.
[13779.78s -> 13780.82s]  That was like breaks up.
[13780.82s -> 13784.18s]  You can move the table around with the left hand trigger.
[13784.18s -> 13785.70s]  You can like adjust where you are.
[13785.70s -> 13786.42s]  Is this all right?
[13791.46s -> 13793.14s]  Oh, that was the worst one yet.
[13793.14s -> 13794.50s]  That was the absolute worst one.
[13794.50s -> 13796.58s]  That was like I'm trying to break this controller in half.
[13798.58s -> 13798.74s]  Yeah.
[13798.74s -> 13799.38s]  How do I kick this?
[13799.38s -> 13801.78s]  Look, I'm like, look at how far away from the table I am.
[13801.78s -> 13802.34s]  How do I do that?
[13803.70s -> 13806.90s]  Uh, I don't know because your controller is different.
[13806.90s -> 13808.10s]  Left hand trigger.
[13808.90s -> 13810.85s]  You hold and you can move the table.
[13811.73s -> 13812.93s]  You can be like a tiny boy.
[13813.73s -> 13820.64s]  Because like here, I'm too close.
[13827.52s -> 13828.40s]  Right hand trigger.
[13829.97s -> 13830.69s]  Left.
[13830.69s -> 13831.89s]  Remember what I'm saying?
[13831.89s -> 13832.13s]  Right.
[13832.85s -> 13834.61s]  There's a dent in the wall.
[13834.61s -> 13835.41s]  Shut the fuck up.
[13835.41s -> 13836.13s]  Don't tell me that.
[13836.77s -> 13850.47s]  It's a fucking like new desk too.
[13853.76s -> 13856.16s]  Oh, I can see where I fucking made a problem here.
[13856.96s -> 13858.79s]  I like chipped it.
[13859.59s -> 13862.05s]  Your controller?
[13862.05s -> 13863.01s]  Oh, okay.
[13863.01s -> 13865.17s]  I see what you're talking about for Spectator Cam.
[13865.17s -> 13867.17s]  Nah, it's not doing that because I have OpenVR.
[13868.05s -> 13869.75s]  I see what you mean though.
[13875.14s -> 13875.46s]  Do you?
[13876.50s -> 13878.74s]  Yeah, because when I take my headset off, I can see it.
[13879.54s -> 13890.55s]  But I need to figure out how to get this not the way to set OBS to the game capture.
[13892.77s -> 13894.13s]  I could just pull it, can't I?
[13894.13s -> 13894.61s]  Yeah.
[13894.61s -> 13895.97s]  Let me just do that real quick.
[13895.97s -> 13902.21s]  Because it creates, yeah, the screen on your monitor is the drag around camera.
[13903.01s -> 13903.73s]  Let's see.
[13905.01s -> 13906.56s]  Is that it?
[13909.75s -> 13910.15s]  There it is.
[13910.71s -> 13911.94s]  There it is.
[13919.48s -> 13922.20s]  But the problem is I need to pull this table closer.
[13923.08s -> 13926.88s]  It should be one of your triggers to move the table.
[13926.88s -> 13927.60s]  I've done them both.
[13928.32s -> 13929.92s]  Do I have to physically grab the table?
[13932.53s -> 13932.85s]  No.
[13932.85s -> 13935.97s]  Anywhere you push, everything turns white and you can move the table.
[13936.85s -> 13940.15s]  For me, it's underneath trigger on the left hand.
[13940.79s -> 13944.45s]  See, when I press that, I get the ball and then I have menu.
[13944.45s -> 13950.23s]  Oh, do the Vive controllers have two triggers?
[13950.23s -> 13951.67s]  I have like the buttons.
[13951.67s -> 13953.43s]  But like looking at your hand, what does it say?
[13954.39s -> 13955.19s]  Menu ball.
[13956.23s -> 13960.29s]  Oh, mine has a hold to reposition thing.
[13961.09s -> 13962.69s]  Can you move it for me?
[13963.80s -> 13964.04s]  No.
[13968.64s -> 13969.28s]  Change back.
[13970.85s -> 13971.65s]  Switch back.
[13971.65s -> 13972.37s]  Change back.
[13974.61s -> 13975.49s]  What's wrong with this?
[13976.13s -> 13982.98s]  It's on the right hand.
[13982.98s -> 13984.02s]  Okay, right hand trigger.
[13984.66s -> 13985.62s]  Not doing anything.
[13985.62s -> 13986.58s]  Right hand grip.
[13986.58s -> 13987.38s]  Doesn't do anything.
[13987.38s -> 13988.82s]  Right hand button.
[13988.82s -> 13989.54s]  Not doing anything.
[13990.26s -> 13990.74s]  Grips.
[13991.38s -> 13991.86s]  Triggers.
[13992.42s -> 13993.14s]  Both triggers.
[13994.32s -> 13994.72s]  Pads.
[13995.84s -> 13996.32s]  Haptic.
[13999.20s -> 13999.76s]  Where is this?
[14000.40s -> 14007.16s]  Maybe it's in the settings.
[14007.16s -> 14007.48s]  Room.
[14008.20s -> 14009.40s]  Challenger.
[14009.40s -> 14011.40s]  What does your right hand trigger do?
[14012.12s -> 14013.80s]  Uh, anything?
[14013.80s -> 14014.28s]  Hold on.
[14016.31s -> 14016.87s]  Studio.
[14017.59s -> 14025.62s]  In game positioning?
[14025.62s -> 14027.14s]  Maybe that's what it is and I don't check it.
[14027.78s -> 14030.96s]  Let's just see what happens.
[14031.76s -> 14032.80s]  Maybe I have that checked.
[14037.24s -> 14038.20s]  Okay, there we go.
[14038.20s -> 14038.84s]  So it's this.
[14043.75s -> 14044.07s]  There we go.
[14044.07s -> 14044.55s]  That's my...
[14044.55s -> 14046.07s]  Okay, that's a thousand times better.
[14046.87s -> 14050.69s]  I think it wasn't selected somehow.
[14050.69s -> 14051.41s]  All right, I'm ready.
[14051.41s -> 14053.09s]  How close am I to the fucking...
[14054.60s -> 14055.32s]  Okay, I'm good.
[14056.20s -> 14057.00s]  Actually, I need...
[14057.00s -> 14057.72s]  All right, I'm good.
[14057.72s -> 14058.68s]  What is happening with my...
[14058.68s -> 14059.64s]  I'm so tangled up.
[14060.68s -> 14061.88s]  Look at this bullshit, guys.
[14084.48s -> 14086.88s]  I'm just seeing a cat head spinning circles.
[14089.54s -> 14090.82s]  I probably shouldn't be doing this,
[14091.80s -> 14094.04s]  but I have enough strength to be able to do it, I think.
[14094.92s -> 14102.40s]  All right, that made it better?
[14103.44s -> 14104.00s]  Or worse?
[14104.72s -> 14108.10s]  No clue.
[14108.10s -> 14110.07s]  It's a mess down here.
[14110.71s -> 14112.68s]  Wait, hold on.
[14117.52s -> 14118.24s]  All right, fuck it.
[14118.24s -> 14119.04s]  Let's go.
[14119.04s -> 14119.54s]  Ready?
[14120.16s -> 14120.64s]  Ready?
[14120.64s -> 14121.12s]  I'm ready.
[14126.37s -> 14127.33s]  You win.
[14127.33s -> 14128.26s]  That was it.
[14128.98s -> 14129.46s]  I won.
[14130.02s -> 14131.19s]  That's the whole thing.
[14140.39s -> 14144.47s]  Oh, boy.
[14144.47s -> 14149.84s]  It's really weird without sound.
[14151.51s -> 14152.47s]  Why are you not playing with sound?
[14153.11s -> 14153.51s]  I don't know.
[14153.51s -> 14154.31s]  I can't get it to work.
[14154.87s -> 14164.66s]  Yeah.
[14164.66s -> 14171.17s]  Damn it.
[14171.17s -> 14176.26s]  It's in the game.
[14176.26s -> 14178.10s]  I just thought about the drunken fight game.
[14180.48s -> 14182.64s]  Damn it.
[14182.64s -> 14185.92s]  It's in the game.
[14185.92s -> 14192.66s]  Oh my.
[14192.66s -> 14194.42s]  Is that from the ceiling like that?
[14194.42s -> 14196.20s]  Mine's like fucked up here, too.
[14196.84s -> 14198.64s]  All right, let's do a ranked match.
[14198.64s -> 14199.04s]  You and me.
[14200.04s -> 14200.92s]  Ranked.
[14200.92s -> 14202.00s]  How do I ready?
[14203.04s -> 14204.40s]  What did you do on the left side?
[14204.40s -> 14204.80s]  Ranked.
[14205.36s -> 14207.36s]  Let me try one more time to get my sound to work.
[14212.31s -> 14213.83s]  Jeremy has a weak backhand.
[14214.47s -> 14217.52s]  I've got a weak every hand.
[14221.38s -> 14222.18s]  First person.
[14222.18s -> 14223.70s]  Put the first person cam back on.
[14224.26s -> 14226.52s]  See, everyone wants the first person cam, man.
[14226.52s -> 14229.32s]  They don't like this like weird spectator mode.
[14230.96s -> 14231.92s]  All right, I'm okay.
[14231.92s -> 14232.96s]  All right, fine.
[14232.96s -> 14234.08s]  If they want to vomit.
[14234.88s -> 14236.23s]  I got you, guys.
[14236.23s -> 14236.55s]  Don't worry.
[14240.58s -> 14241.30s]  I wasn't even...
[14241.94s -> 14242.58s]  I tried to...
[14244.63s -> 14245.43s]  Yeah, see, you're gonna...
[14245.43s -> 14246.63s]  I keep wanting to touch the table.
[14246.63s -> 14247.83s]  That's not how it works, Jeremy.
[14247.83s -> 14251.67s]  Everyone's doing vomit emotes.
[14251.67s -> 14252.39s]  You asked for this.
[14253.92s -> 14254.56s]  All right, I'm ready.
[14256.74s -> 14258.60s]  I don't know how to ready.
[14258.60s -> 14259.80s]  To the left of the table is a...
[14259.80s -> 14260.84s]  It says ranked and unranked.
[14260.84s -> 14261.96s]  Oh, okay, I got it.
[14261.96s -> 14262.84s]  Game one, ranked.
[14266.52s -> 14267.00s]  Here, sir.
[14267.72s -> 14275.51s]  Okay.
[14281.17s -> 14281.41s]  Okay.
[14287.67s -> 14287.99s]  Thank you.
[14293.96s -> 14294.60s]  Here, sir.
[14297.78s -> 14303.49s]  God damn it.
[14304.29s -> 14306.48s]  Here, here we go.
[14307.20s -> 14309.51s]  Whoops.
[14312.50s -> 14312.82s]  What?
[14314.07s -> 14315.27s]  Oh, that was bullshit.
[14315.83s -> 14316.15s]  You know what?
[14316.15s -> 14316.95s]  You couldn't get that?
[14318.39s -> 14325.35s]  That's a fault?
[14327.03s -> 14328.63s]  You can't throw the ball over
[14330.98s -> 14332.10s]  the line of the table and you still...
[14332.10s -> 14332.34s]  No.
[14335.09s -> 14345.51s]  Come on, let me get the 30% on you.
[14347.67s -> 14348.79s]  What the fuck did I do?
[14349.59s -> 14349.83s]  What?
[14349.83s -> 14351.27s]  I can't cross the line, bro.
[14354.18s -> 14356.10s]  I can turn that off, actually.
[14356.66s -> 14357.14s]  All right, I'm...
[14359.88s -> 14361.56s]  I got no awareness here.
[14361.56s -> 14363.08s]  Turned it off.
[14363.08s -> 14367.99s]  This is gonna be tighter.
[14367.99s -> 14372.45s]  You ready?
[14372.45s -> 14372.93s]  I'm ready.
[14381.30s -> 14383.14s]  This really is the most dangerous game.
[14383.78s -> 14387.38s]  I've hit the wall more times.
[14387.38s -> 14390.26s]  I've done VR streams like eight times.
[14390.26s -> 14390.82s]  Oh, God.
[14391.46s -> 14392.66s]  Oh, my chair's behind me.
[14407.52s -> 14407.84s]  Hit it.
[14415.38s -> 14416.90s]  I fucking ate myself.
[14418.58s -> 14419.38s]  That's the worst too.
[14419.38s -> 14420.26s]  I didn't mean to.
[14420.26s -> 14421.70s]  If you hit anything to the corners
[14421.70s -> 14423.46s]  then it's like my wall's right here.
[14423.46s -> 14425.46s]  How do you do like the fucking curve?
[14425.46s -> 14426.34s]  What do I do?
[14426.34s -> 14429.32s]  So you go like...
[14433.40s -> 14433.64s]  No.
[14434.20s -> 14437.99s]  I got it.
[14437.99s -> 14438.23s]  No.
[14441.43s -> 14442.47s]  You got it.
[14442.47s -> 14449.92s]  You're getting it.
[14450.56s -> 14454.32s]  I don't know how to do it, okay?
[14454.32s -> 14458.90s]  That was your fault.
[14458.90s -> 14462.77s]  Whoops.
[14462.77s -> 14463.49s]  No, I see what you're doing.
[14463.73s -> 14464.93s]  You're doing like you're pancakeing it.
[14466.05s -> 14467.33s]  You got a pancake.
[14467.33s -> 14470.92s]  What was it on that?
[14470.92s -> 14472.58s]  It never hit your side.
[14481.83s -> 14490.02s]  Hey, by the way, your apartment sucks.
[14490.02s -> 14492.85s]  White brick, dirty windows.
[14493.92s -> 14495.12s]  What does that go?
[14495.12s -> 14496.56s]  Why do you have a staircase there?
[14496.56s -> 14497.36s]  But what is up there?
[14498.32s -> 14499.36s]  Your locker is up there?
[14500.76s -> 14501.56s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[14501.56s -> 14503.08s]  You got a lot of shit to talk.
[14503.08s -> 14505.08s]  You haven't even seen my basement.
[14505.08s -> 14509.11s]  Had to come down here
[14509.11s -> 14511.51s]  when I have some philosophical quandaries
[14511.51s -> 14513.51s]  about how much taller I am than you.
[14515.59s -> 14516.95s]  Sometimes I just like to, you know,
[14516.95s -> 14519.43s]  just wonder how could one person be that short?
[14520.23s -> 14521.43s]  We just surf from up here.
[14531.48s -> 14532.52s]  I couldn't get down.
[14539.09s -> 14540.13s]  Get a little taller.
[14540.77s -> 14541.57s]  A little bit taller.
[14542.55s -> 14543.35s]  Every point I get.
[14553.27s -> 14555.40s]  Wow.
[14555.40s -> 14557.08s]  Rating zero to 16.
[14557.08s -> 14557.40s]  Cool.
[14558.12s -> 14563.00s]  Dude, I'm going to be ranked 10 million soon.
[14566.50s -> 14567.78s]  I tried to watch the replay.
[14569.67s -> 14570.87s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[14570.87s -> 14572.29s]  Does it record voices too?
[14573.70s -> 14574.98s]  I don't think so.
[14574.98s -> 14577.67s]  Oh, how do we?
[14577.67s -> 14585.40s]  All right, let's go again.
[14585.40s -> 14585.90s]  Ready?
[14586.44s -> 14593.30s]  All right, surf.
[14593.30s -> 14593.80s]  Rank it up.
[14594.42s -> 14598.93s]  Here's your surf, I think.
[14610.56s -> 14611.06s]  Okay.
[14614.95s -> 14615.59s]  Okay.
[14615.59s -> 14621.32s]  Pick out these million dollar pieces.
[14621.32s -> 14622.52s]  Where do you get that from?
[14622.52s -> 14623.48s]  King touch tomb.
[14624.12s -> 14625.80s]  Please don't look at it.
[14625.80s -> 14627.24s]  It gets older when you look at it.
[14639.06s -> 14640.02s]  Just nice and easy.
[14641.38s -> 14642.18s]  Nice and easy.
[14642.18s -> 14642.98s]  You don't understand.
[14642.98s -> 14643.54s]  He plays.
[14644.26s -> 14647.06s]  He plays like professional table tennis.
[14647.62s -> 14652.95s]  You know, you just start making things up just so you don't look bad.
[14654.08s -> 14655.28s]  Oh, what did that happen?
[14656.00s -> 14673.06s]  I think the five controls have these big balloon heads.
[14673.70s -> 14676.87s]  You know, just got to start making things up.
[14677.51s -> 14679.68s]  Why am I just trying to catch that in my groin?
[14679.68s -> 14697.75s]  It was like, what's the fucking like glass I can throw at you?
[14698.55s -> 14715.43s]  Nice try, but you didn't get it.
[14720.08s -> 14720.80s]  What the hell was that?
[14720.80s -> 14721.92s]  Like whipple ball bullshit.
[14722.56s -> 14723.68s]  Whipple ball bullshit?
[14724.40s -> 14732.58s]  Come over here, table.
[14736.87s -> 14740.95s]  That's just the I'm done.
[14741.91s -> 14742.71s]  I'm done.
[14742.71s -> 14743.21s]  I'm good.
[14745.49s -> 14747.94s]  That was my mic.
[14752.00s -> 14752.56s]  You got me.
[14754.88s -> 14756.16s]  Yeah, that's okay.
[14756.16s -> 14758.64s]  VR, when you play with a friend, you're just playing battleship.
[14759.68s -> 14761.12s]  Like you bumped into the wall.
[14761.12s -> 14762.48s]  Like that's C2.
[14762.48s -> 14763.12s]  I get a point.
[14766.66s -> 14769.54s]  I got to come into your room and put like chairs and shit in the way.
[14769.54s -> 14770.82s]  And you have to do it to my room.
[14770.90s -> 14771.78s]  VR battleship.
[14772.58s -> 14773.86s]  Take this chair out of the way.
[14773.86s -> 14774.90s]  I never have it here.
[14779.67s -> 14780.63s]  Why didn't you return it?
[14780.63s -> 14783.57s]  Did the people say that was a bad joke?
[14785.75s -> 14786.47s]  I'm going to name it what?
[14787.11s -> 14787.75s]  How dare you?
[14788.55s -> 14796.28s]  Seven to six, I'm still winning.
[14796.84s -> 14799.72s]  If we're playing beer hockey, what's it called?
[14799.72s -> 14801.00s]  Oh my god, you were.
[14801.00s -> 14801.56s]  Air hockey.
[14801.56s -> 14807.57s]  If we're playing air hockey, I want to do 11.
[14808.66s -> 14810.34s]  Yeah, name of the game.
[14811.96s -> 14813.96s]  The name of the game is ping pong, actually.
[14815.99s -> 14818.79s]  Actually, name of this game is 11, table tennis.
[14818.79s -> 14820.39s]  The name of this game is ping pong.
[14820.95s -> 14825.08s]  Double nine.
[14831.73s -> 14833.01s]  Come on, you stupid game.
[14833.01s -> 14833.65s]  I'm not worried.
[14851.52s -> 14853.52s]  Your name here versus stir.
[14854.66s -> 14856.10s]  Yeah, they think that's the one.
[14858.21s -> 14858.69s]  All right, hold on.
[14858.69s -> 14859.49s]  I'm watching something.
[14859.49s -> 14859.97s]  Is this?
[14859.97s -> 14860.69s]  I got to get out of the way.
[14863.51s -> 14864.07s]  Who's who?
[14864.63s -> 14869.14s]  This is not the whole replay.
[14877.28s -> 14878.80s]  What part of the replay are we watching?
[14888.48s -> 14890.16s]  I always do like the pancake.
[14902.85s -> 14903.89s]  I got a shit.
[14904.85s -> 14915.51s]  Oh, was that when he hit his hand?
[14915.51s -> 14916.39s]  When does he hit his hand?
[14916.95s -> 14919.43s]  Oh, no.
[14920.31s -> 14932.84s]  All right, you know something I'm noticing right now?
[14933.40s -> 14936.84s]  Look at how much I'm talking and gesturing with my fucking hands.
[14938.58s -> 14940.74s]  You really are a moody Susan.
[14940.74s -> 14941.86s]  I'm like, let me tell you something.
[14944.50s -> 14945.62s]  Do I do this?
[14946.68s -> 14946.92s]  Yeah.
[14947.72s -> 14949.64s]  Like, look at over there.
[14949.64s -> 14951.86s]  He just is a person.
[14952.50s -> 14954.58s]  I'm like a cartoon character.
[14955.70s -> 14967.91s]  Hold on, stop, stop.
[14967.91s -> 14969.19s]  Oh, don't yell at me.
[14980.63s -> 14982.23s]  Look at the amount of movement over here.
[14983.51s -> 14985.83s]  I'm going to do this at like time's fucking five speed.
[14985.83s -> 14987.83s]  Just look at the movement on this side of the table.
[14988.55s -> 14990.76s]  This person's being electrocuted.
[14990.76s -> 14991.80s]  This person's just hanging out.
[14995.64s -> 14996.04s]  Yeah.
[14996.04s -> 14996.68s]  Do you understand?
[14996.68s -> 14998.12s]  Like, what the fuck is wrong with me?
[15002.50s -> 15003.14s]  Oh, my God.
[15003.14s -> 15004.66s]  All right, let's do one more.
[15004.66s -> 15005.72s]  How do I get out of here?
[15005.72s -> 15006.68s]  Do I have to invite you again?
[15011.01s -> 15012.53s]  No, I'm the tallest one.
[15015.20s -> 15016.16s]  All right, let me get out of here.
[15021.43s -> 15023.35s]  All right, back to main menu.
[15023.35s -> 15024.39s]  I'm trying to scratch my nose.
[15024.39s -> 15025.27s]  What is minigames?
[15027.62s -> 15031.86s]  Um, it has a simulated ping pong robot.
[15031.86s -> 15032.42s]  Oh.
[15032.42s -> 15034.10s]  And different challenges you can do with it.
[15040.92s -> 15043.64s]  There's nothing wrong with being an animated talker man.
[15045.28s -> 15046.40s]  All right, you got to throw me an invite.
[15047.43s -> 15048.15s]  I'm looking.
[15048.87s -> 15051.67s]  Can we go to one of the other expensive rooms in your house?
[15052.98s -> 15054.66s]  Yeah, it says you're idle.
[15055.46s -> 15055.78s]  Idle?
[15057.49s -> 15058.37s]  How about now?
[15058.37s -> 15071.36s]  I don't know why I can't invite you.
[15072.47s -> 15074.15s]  If you go to multiplayer,
[15075.03s -> 15077.35s]  and you should be able to scroll and find my name.
[15077.35s -> 15079.19s]  Tommy Pickles uses online.
[15082.31s -> 15084.63s]  All right, hold on.
[15084.63s -> 15085.11s]  Itchy nose.
[15090.13s -> 15097.16s]  All right, loading my roof.
[15097.72s -> 15099.75s]  Oh, Jesus.
[15100.47s -> 15101.68s]  This is bizarre.
[15106.23s -> 15108.07s]  I don't like it, though, because the ball is white,
[15108.07s -> 15109.43s]  and so is the background.
[15109.43s -> 15110.71s]  There's only two good levels.
[15111.59s -> 15113.51s]  The other one's like a winter one,
[15113.51s -> 15115.19s]  and it also is like really blue.
[15115.91s -> 15118.72s]  Oh, this is nice.
[15119.28s -> 15121.60s]  This is like whoever loses, the vultures get you.
[15122.77s -> 15123.41s]  Las Vegas.
[15128.26s -> 15129.78s]  You're going to have to find like a better friend,
[15131.14s -> 15134.66s]  because like I'm like a bad player, a friend player.
[15139.25s -> 15143.76s]  Hold on.
[15143.76s -> 15144.32s]  Same spot.
[15153.20s -> 15154.08s]  Shit.
[15154.08s -> 15157.01s]  If you got that, I would have I would have S'd your D.
[15162.13s -> 15163.33s]  Wouldn't be as animated as you,
[15163.33s -> 15164.53s]  so you don't feel bad afterwards.
[15165.41s -> 15168.39s]  Oh, speaking of vultures, there they are.
[15168.39s -> 15169.43s]  A lot of them.
[15169.43s -> 15174.71s]  This level is kind of laggy.
[15175.43s -> 15177.75s]  You getting any laggy here?
[15177.75s -> 15178.31s]  No, that's fine.
[15179.99s -> 15180.47s]  Little deal.
[15181.84s -> 15182.88s]  Actually, I am getting it.
[15182.88s -> 15183.68s]  I'm switching.
[15183.68s -> 15184.72s]  That was really bad.
[15187.14s -> 15188.50s]  You should see the part of the controller here.
[15188.50s -> 15189.38s]  I'll show it on camera.
[15190.02s -> 15197.78s]  All right, give me some tips.
[15198.34s -> 15200.18s]  How do I stop doing like the under pancake?
[15202.90s -> 15204.02s]  Every time a ball comes, I go.
[15205.06s -> 15208.92s]  It's really hard to tell what you're doing
[15208.92s -> 15210.04s]  without seeing your arms.
[15212.48s -> 15213.60s]  Just watch my stream.
[15214.40s -> 15216.08s]  Just turn on my stream.
[15216.64s -> 15218.08s]  Do you really think you're going to learn anything?
[15221.04s -> 15223.92s]  Just get like VR window and open up my stream
[15223.92s -> 15224.64s]  while you stream.
[15225.20s -> 15227.36s]  Oh wait, you're not streaming.
[15227.92s -> 15231.49s]  Well, technically you are.
[15232.13s -> 15237.52s]  Technically, we're all streaming.
[15237.52s -> 15238.24s]  Two to six.
[15238.80s -> 15242.34s]  I caught it.
[15242.34s -> 15243.38s]  It doesn't count.
[15243.38s -> 15246.52s]  Whoops.
[15246.52s -> 15251.68s]  Like how do you do that?
[15252.56s -> 15253.28s]  That like-
[15253.28s -> 15253.84s]  Just hit it.
[15256.88s -> 15258.56s]  You're like charging up an EX move.
[15258.56s -> 15259.68s]  I can like see you doing it.
[15260.32s -> 15260.82s]  You go like-
[15260.82s -> 15261.30s]  What?
[15261.30s -> 15261.86s]  You go like-
[15262.42s -> 15266.95s]  Cause you gotta, you gotta do it.
[15269.12s -> 15270.48s]  I can't explain it to you over the internet.
[15270.48s -> 15271.84s]  You have a fighting game tell
[15271.84s -> 15272.80s]  when you're going to do that.
[15273.52s -> 15274.64s]  I feel like I should parry you.
[15275.36s -> 15276.84s]  Like I need to go.
[15277.64s -> 15279.49s]  Well, parry this.
[15280.13s -> 15289.97s]  That's not going to work.
[15289.97s -> 15291.25s]  You know, let me know if you want to think about that.
[15295.28s -> 15296.64s]  Oh, here's the edge.
[15298.10s -> 15302.34s]  The game sucks.
[15303.06s -> 15307.38s]  You know, I could see how two table tennis enthusiasts
[15308.56s -> 15311.04s]  could really play this and add love every second of it.
[15311.04s -> 15311.84s]  It's, it's really-
[15311.84s -> 15312.64s]  The physics are-
[15313.76s -> 15314.32s]  It's pretty good.
[15314.32s -> 15315.44s]  Surprisingly accurate.
[15315.44s -> 15316.48s]  I was pointing out on my stream
[15316.48s -> 15318.08s]  there's like two things it does wrong,
[15318.08s -> 15318.88s]  but they're not-
[15319.44s -> 15324.84s]  That big of a deal.
[15324.84s -> 15326.28s]  The biggest way you can tell-
[15326.28s -> 15329.80s]  You can actually change how much in your paddle has.
[15330.52s -> 15330.92s]  Oh, really?
[15330.92s -> 15331.96s]  And the options and everything
[15331.96s -> 15333.24s]  and change what kind of paddle it is.
[15333.80s -> 15334.12s]  That's cool.
[15334.12s -> 15335.56s]  But if you have a really spinning paddle
[15335.56s -> 15336.44s]  and you just put the ball on it
[15336.44s -> 15337.48s]  and you move the ball around,
[15338.04s -> 15341.24s]  it's pretty fully accurate to what it would do
[15341.80s -> 15342.52s]  and how it would feel.
[15343.72s -> 15345.16s]  The feedback when you hit the ball,
[15345.16s -> 15346.20s]  that little like knee.
[15347.16s -> 15347.72s]  Yeah.
[15347.72s -> 15349.56s]  It's like you can actually feel like-
[15350.84s -> 15352.92s]  You actually, you know, you feel like Spider-Man.
[15352.92s -> 15353.40s]  You know what I'm saying?
[15354.44s -> 15355.64s]  Yeah, I know what you're saying.
[15363.35s -> 15369.65s]  Ha ha ha.
[15369.65s -> 15371.00s]  Fuck.
[15371.00s -> 15372.20s]  Hey, pro tip.
[15373.08s -> 15373.88s]  Hey, pro tip.
[15374.68s -> 15376.05s]  You're not listening.
[15376.05s -> 15377.09s]  If I swing down,
[15378.05s -> 15379.65s]  the ball's going to drop down.
[15379.65s -> 15382.05s]  If I swing up, the ball is going to go up.
[15382.77s -> 15384.45s]  When you see me doing these big swings
[15385.09s -> 15386.85s]  and your paddle's flat,
[15386.85s -> 15387.97s]  it's going to go straight down.
[15389.01s -> 15390.13s]  Okay, so when you go like this,
[15390.13s -> 15390.69s]  go like this.
[15390.69s -> 15391.97s]  And when you go like this,
[15391.97s -> 15392.93s]  go like this.
[15392.93s -> 15394.29s]  When I go down,
[15394.29s -> 15396.61s]  you need to make your paddle like this.
[15396.61s -> 15398.37s]  When it hits here, down is forward.
[15399.01s -> 15400.53s]  You get it, down is forward now.
[15402.13s -> 15403.65s]  Oh, okay.
[15403.65s -> 15405.33s]  So like in one of those mirror puzzle games,
[15405.33s -> 15406.77s]  where I have to bend the laser.
[15408.64s -> 15410.08s]  Yes, you have to bend the laser.
[15410.08s -> 15412.08s]  Move the laser with the mirror into the spot
[15412.08s -> 15412.72s]  and you get the key.
[15412.72s -> 15413.20s]  Yeah.
[15413.20s -> 15413.68s]  Okay.
[15413.68s -> 15414.18s]  Yeah.
[15418.37s -> 15419.01s]  You did it.
[15419.01s -> 15419.57s]  That was good.
[15424.13s -> 15425.33s]  Why am I hearing voices?
[15427.33s -> 15429.25s]  This is the first time you've asked yourself that.
[15429.25s -> 15430.05s]  No, no, no, no.
[15433.24s -> 15434.60s]  I'm hearing voices.
[15437.11s -> 15437.75s]  I swear.
[15447.14s -> 15448.29s]  Got him.
[15448.29s -> 15448.85s]  That didn't count?
[15448.85s -> 15449.65s]  What?
[15449.65s -> 15451.06s]  That's my point.
[15456.58s -> 15457.38s]  I had to itch.
[15458.02s -> 15460.82s]  I have an inside of my nose itch.
[15475.28s -> 15475.52s]  See?
[15480.07s -> 15481.27s]  Wait, you're in the closet.
[15481.91s -> 15483.16s]  Get out of my way.
[15485.35s -> 15486.87s]  I was in the closet the whole time.
[15488.90s -> 15489.22s]  All right.
[15489.22s -> 15490.02s]  How are you doing?
[15490.02s -> 15490.74s]  You good?
[15490.74s -> 15491.62s]  Watch replay.
[15492.34s -> 15494.63s]  Why would you want me to watch this one?
[15494.63s -> 15499.33s]  All right.
[15499.33s -> 15500.69s]  I'll watch the replay.
[15500.69s -> 15514.15s]  Oh, where's the game?
[15515.11s -> 15515.35s]  What?
[15515.99s -> 15516.79s]  I have the replay.
[15516.79s -> 15517.35s]  It's not playing.
[15520.10s -> 15521.86s]  Why do you keep watching the replay?
[15521.86s -> 15522.58s]  I don't understand.
[15522.58s -> 15523.46s]  You just played.
[15523.46s -> 15525.54s]  Because Chad's saying watch replay.
[15526.26s -> 15532.50s]  All right.
[15532.50s -> 15533.38s]  Anything else you want to do?
[15534.68s -> 15536.20s]  I could do this forever, so.
[15536.20s -> 15537.40s]  You could do this forever.
[15538.12s -> 15539.96s]  I get trapped in the loop.
[15543.83s -> 15544.63s]  One guy.
[15547.80s -> 15549.88s]  Watch the bot, one person says.
[15550.68s -> 15552.47s]  Do you have anything else?
[15552.47s -> 15554.23s]  Do you have any other experiences you want to just try?
[15558.18s -> 15561.88s]  It would be cool if I could show you the minigame, but I can't.
[15561.88s -> 15562.44s]  No.
[15562.44s -> 15564.04s]  Because you can't actually multiplayer that.
[15564.04s -> 15565.00s]  They don't really know me.
[15565.00s -> 15565.40s]  Just see.
[15567.48s -> 15569.48s]  Oh, listen to the voices.
[15570.52s -> 15575.52s]  Let me see what else we got.
[15581.16s -> 15583.00s]  Oh, we can go for like four and a half hours or so.
[15583.80s -> 15586.88s]  Turret looks really dirty.
[15586.88s -> 15587.92s]  I'm just really sweaty.
[15591.16s -> 15591.96s]  Pavlov.
[15591.96s -> 15593.40s]  Everybody wants us to play Pavlov.
[15594.84s -> 15596.92s]  I would play it, but I think we should do it another day.
[15596.92s -> 15597.72s]  You want to do it another day?
[15597.72s -> 15598.84s]  To get its own thing, yeah.
[15599.56s -> 15601.19s]  What are you doing tomorrow?
[15604.08s -> 15605.20s]  Playing Pavlov with you.
[15605.20s -> 15606.48s]  You want to play Pavlov tomorrow?
[15607.12s -> 15608.55s]  Sure.
[15608.55s -> 15610.36s]  I don't think I'm doing anything.
[15610.92s -> 15612.79s]  I mean, it's up to you.
[15613.59s -> 15615.11s]  Yeah, I'm saying yes.
[15615.11s -> 15615.59s]  Okay.
[15615.59s -> 15617.43s]  Maybe we'll get like another couple to play.
[15618.82s -> 15619.78s]  He's bruised.
[15619.78s -> 15622.18s]  Yeah, but I have like actually bruised cheeks.
[15622.90s -> 15627.41s]  Are we getting desert bus today?
[15627.41s -> 15628.13s]  We completed it.
[15628.13s -> 15628.85s]  We did the whole thing.
[15629.57s -> 15633.01s]  Yeah, it's over.
[15635.00s -> 15636.52s]  I'm like so into VR.
[15636.52s -> 15638.68s]  Sorry that I'm like a VR streamer.
[15638.68s -> 15639.24s]  Like, no.
[15640.04s -> 15643.88s]  We had Pavlov onward.
[15643.88s -> 15645.08s]  There was a couple others.
[15645.08s -> 15645.72s]  Where was that list?
[15646.44s -> 15648.61s]  Show controller?
[15648.61s -> 15649.33s]  Oh, here, I'll show you.
[15649.97s -> 15652.08s]  I don't know if you can see it in the camera,
[15652.08s -> 15654.32s]  but like it's I like chipped off like the front here.
[15655.60s -> 15657.51s]  See like that.
[15658.23s -> 15665.89s]  Like a little focuses right here.
[15666.45s -> 15669.68s]  There's like an indent and like it's white.
[15672.96s -> 15673.36s]  I like.
[15677.19s -> 15677.59s]  Let me see.
[15677.59s -> 15679.43s]  Yeah, this is like a bunch of stuff to play.
[15680.15s -> 15686.47s]  Are you still here?
[15687.27s -> 15693.06s]  Yeah, I can't find where the thing is in this game.
[15696.50s -> 15697.94s]  I also want to play like Mind Show.
[15697.94s -> 15699.94s]  There's so much like fucking VR I want to play.
[15703.17s -> 15705.01s]  But we can call here if you want.
[15705.01s -> 15708.61s]  Take a break because the drunken bar fight game.
[15708.61s -> 15712.48s]  I act like sometimes I get in one of these games
[15712.48s -> 15713.68s]  and like an after an hour goes by
[15713.68s -> 15716.08s]  and I'm just getting constant fucking pain from either laughing
[15716.08s -> 15717.52s]  or like fucking wheezing.
[15720.00s -> 15721.92s]  There's a multiplayer mod for Beat Saber.
[15721.92s -> 15722.48s]  Are you serious?
[15724.53s -> 15728.05s]  My understanding is just that it shows your scores at the same time.
[15728.05s -> 15730.29s]  So you're competing for a better score on the same level.
[15732.13s -> 15733.73s]  If there's something else, I don't know about it.
[15734.45s -> 15736.93s]  People saying we should play Minecraft in VR.
[15738.36s -> 15739.48s]  Oh, yeah, Minecraft.
[15740.12s -> 15740.68s]  God, no.
[15742.92s -> 15745.40s]  Yeah, we'll play some more stuff tomorrow.
[15745.40s -> 15746.68s]  We'll do Pavlov tomorrow.
[15746.68s -> 15748.52s]  We'll give like Pavlov like a real
[15749.16s -> 15752.76s]  because that's like a full on multiplayer shooter experience, isn't it?
[15755.88s -> 15756.36s]  Pavlov?
[15756.92s -> 15757.40s]  Pavlov.
[15757.40s -> 15758.28s]  I think so.
[15758.28s -> 15758.92s]  All right.
[15758.92s -> 15763.96s]  Well, that's probably as good as any time to call it for the day.
[15764.68s -> 15767.40s]  I'm going to wake up sore tomorrow.
[15767.72s -> 15768.36s]  That's the thing.
[15768.36s -> 15769.88s]  When I've been playing so much VR,
[15769.88s -> 15772.28s]  I'm like building up my muscular tolerance again.
[15773.00s -> 15780.56s]  You should do Mind Show for your own full stream.
[15780.56s -> 15783.68s]  Yeah, that's why I'm like Mr. VR.
[15784.80s -> 15785.44s]  Oh, my God.
[15787.86s -> 15789.46s]  How many times did I slam into a wall today?
[15789.46s -> 15789.94s]  Like six?
[15790.58s -> 15793.22s]  How many times did he slam into a wall?
[15793.86s -> 15796.13s]  Like two?
[15796.85s -> 15800.31s]  I think it was two.
[15802.82s -> 15804.18s]  You sunk my battleship today.
[15804.82s -> 15807.52s]  We love the VR.
[15807.52s -> 15808.40s]  It's not a problem.
[15808.40s -> 15810.00s]  I mean, it's just so much fun.
[15810.80s -> 15813.20s]  It's something I've never had this experience before in my life.
[15813.76s -> 15815.36s]  So it's worth having.
[15816.08s -> 15817.40s]  All right.
[15817.40s -> 15818.20s]  Let me get this off.
[15819.09s -> 15822.37s]  And we'll start probably on the same time tomorrow if you want.
[15825.00s -> 15826.12s]  So thanks for hanging out, everybody.
[15827.00s -> 15830.98s]  Yeah, this will be like just about probably like a four and a half, five hour stream.
[15831.54s -> 15832.58s]  It's kind of what they've been.
[15833.38s -> 15834.50s]  Just only so long I can do it.
[15837.09s -> 15839.33s]  But yeah, I'll be in touch.
[15839.97s -> 15841.25s]  We'll figure out what games we're going to play.
[15845.06s -> 15846.26s]  Bye, everyone.
[15846.26s -> 15846.74s]  Say bye.
[15846.74s -> 15849.30s]  And like, he has a Twitch, you know.
[15850.55s -> 15853.83s]  And I have a YouTube channel where I'm not allowed to upload videos anymore.
[15853.83s -> 15854.39s]  That's true.
[15855.19s -> 15855.99s]  It's a court order.
[15857.51s -> 15859.11s]  Can we get a stirrer link here?
[15861.59s -> 15863.91s]  What are you, what's your number one game in?
[15863.91s -> 15864.39s]  Apex?
[15865.11s -> 15866.31s]  My other, my what?

[15870.34s -> 15873.09s]  Getting dirty club.
[15873.09s -> 15875.48s]  I stream it all.
[15877.70s -> 15880.66s]  You've really been into that like press the button with the monster voice today.
[15880.66s -> 15882.82s]  I like the monster voice because it really
[15884.68s -> 15885.88s]  Then you know I'm for real.
[15888.37s -> 15890.61s]  No, I got to like, I'm going to physically like type your name.
[15892.16s -> 15892.48s]  Dude, I don't know.
[15892.48s -> 15893.28s]  It's stir, right?
[15897.75s -> 15898.15s]  I don't know.
[15898.15s -> 15899.43s]  You change your name sometimes.
[15901.88s -> 15903.24s]  Like four years ago.
[15903.24s -> 15903.88s]  Who was this?
[15903.88s -> 15905.56s]  I don't even know who he is anymore.
[15905.56s -> 15907.64s]  We played Lethal League like a week ago.
[15907.64s -> 15908.68s]  Relax.
[15908.68s -> 15909.32s]  What is your name?
[15909.32s -> 15910.44s]  Like German948?
[15913.96s -> 15915.16s]  Yeah, we already talked about the forest.
[15915.16s -> 15917.56s]  You didn't want to do the forest because of the, it was going to take too long.
[15918.12s -> 15921.96s]  Yeah, I didn't, I didn't want a full stream of a full forest stream.
[15922.76s -> 15924.98s]  Oh, man.
[15925.62s -> 15926.84s]  All right.
[15926.84s -> 15928.04s]  Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
[15928.04s -> 15928.84s]  We'll play some more.
[15928.84s -> 15929.08s]  Yeah.
[15929.08s -> 15929.40s]  Thanks.
[15929.40s -> 15931.40s]  Thanks for our first ever collab we did today.
[15931.40s -> 15932.52s]  Maybe we can do more.
[15932.52s -> 15933.78s]  Yeah.
[15933.78s -> 15934.82s]  Now have a good night.
[15934.82s -> 15936.39s]  Good night.
[15936.39s -> 15937.20s]  Bye.
[15937.76s -> 15939.46s]  Yeah.
[15939.46s -> 15939.94s]  We'll see you.
[15940.58s -> 15946.88s]  Just putting like weird pressure on my eyes and eyebrows and I feel like my eyebrow.
[15946.88s -> 15948.96s]  I look like a different like a different person.
[15948.96s -> 15951.22s]  It's like squishing my eyelids.
[15953.52s -> 15953.76s]  All right.
[15953.76s -> 15955.12s]  Let's get to the bits here.
[15956.47s -> 15957.43s]  See you guys tomorrow.
[15957.43s -> 15958.07s]  It's taking off.
[15958.95s -> 15960.23s]  More multiplayer VR.
[15962.64s -> 15964.56s]  I'm going to pad my room.
[15967.11s -> 15969.03s]  You look weird when you do that.
[15969.03s -> 15970.87s]  I look weird probably every day.
[15971.59s -> 15974.12s]  Do Google Earth VR.
[15974.12s -> 15975.16s]  Can you do that multiplayer?
[15975.72s -> 15977.38s]  That doesn't work multiplayer, does it?
[15977.94s -> 15983.16s]  All right.
[15983.16s -> 15985.72s]  Let's get out of this and put this up.
[15986.68s -> 15987.56s]  No, that's not VRB.
[15988.36s -> 15990.90s]  We need to see a later one.
[15992.85s -> 15993.49s]  There it goes.
[15993.49s -> 15993.73s]  Okay.
[15993.73s -> 15994.93s]  Let me get out of here.
[15994.93s -> 15996.45s]  Payday 2 has VR.
[15996.45s -> 16000.00s]  Yeah, I had a fucking lot of fun though.
[16001.70s -> 16009.80s]  Even in like rec room and then that zombie game started out kind of a little bit annoying,
[16009.80s -> 16012.36s]  but turned out to be absolutely fucking fun.
[16016.85s -> 16018.29s]  I could see how if you get four of your friends,
[16018.29s -> 16019.89s]  that would be some of the most fun you could probably have.
[16020.61s -> 16022.50s]  But no, that's I love it.
[16023.06s -> 16029.24s]  So we'll see you tomorrow.
[16029.88s -> 16030.60s]  Here come the bits.
[16031.62s -> 16032.58s]  Thanks everyone for sticking around.
[16033.72s -> 16034.52s]  See you real soon.
[16035.65s -> 16039.57s]  And let's go back about four to four and a half hours ago here.
[16041.16s -> 16044.45s]  Stirr hosted you with one viewer.
[16048.84s -> 16049.08s]  What?
[16049.80s -> 16050.52s]  With what?
[16050.52s -> 16050.84s]  Him?
[16051.72s -> 16052.28s]  Was it him?
[16052.28s -> 16053.40s]  Was it he the only one?
[16054.12s -> 16058.16s]  Thanks a lot Stirr for those.
[16062.08s -> 16063.04s]  That's so funny.
[16065.44s -> 16066.64s]  It was just him.
[16067.68s -> 16068.88s]  You probably didn't do it right.
[16070.60s -> 16071.32s]  Oh my God.
[16072.28s -> 16073.56s]  Thank you Divus for the 250.
[16074.20s -> 16075.40s]  Appreciate it.
[16075.40s -> 16081.81s]  Let me get the chat out here.
[16082.53s -> 16083.97s]  The actual chat.
[16083.97s -> 16091.73s]  Let me shut down that VR.
[16091.73s -> 16092.21s]  Real quick.
[16092.85s -> 16095.76s]  Is there a multiplayer horror game?
[16095.76s -> 16096.88s]  No, there really isn't.
[16097.52s -> 16099.20s]  That's kind of sad and unfortunate.
[16101.33s -> 16103.25s]  I was we've been looking.
[16103.97s -> 16107.70s]  There really is not a horror VR multiplayer game.
[16112.26s -> 16116.04s]  Unfortunately, raw data is kind of horror.
[16121.41s -> 16122.93s]  Jet Island, he won't play it.
[16124.87s -> 16127.35s]  He already told me he saw me playing that game.
[16127.35s -> 16129.03s]  He's like, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[16129.03s -> 16134.72s]  It's hard enough to make a good multiplayer horror game
[16134.72s -> 16135.52s]  in general anyway.
[16135.52s -> 16136.40s]  Yeah, it is.
[16140.18s -> 16143.14s]  But thank you to Divus.
[16143.14s -> 16144.58s]  Thank you Bake Me Home for the 250.
[16146.31s -> 16147.75s]  Thank you Fitty for the five bucks.
[16148.55s -> 16150.71s]  This makes it a hundred thousand dollars.
[16150.71s -> 16152.47s]  Can you please release my family now?
[16153.99s -> 16155.51s]  Are they even alive still?
[16155.51s -> 16156.15s]  Please Jeremy.
[16157.19s -> 16160.58s]  Thank you Fitty for the five bucks.
[16160.58s -> 16161.14s]  Appreciate it.
[16165.33s -> 16166.69s]  Thank you Num Legs for the ten bucks.
[16168.29s -> 16168.69s]  Thank you.
[16170.07s -> 16170.95s]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[16171.51s -> 16177.65s]  There's a horror game called The Exorcist Legion VR.
[16177.65s -> 16178.53s]  Is that?
[16178.53s -> 16181.32s]  Didn't acknowledge what?
[16183.08s -> 16184.36s]  Oh, oh, oh, you guys are okay.
[16185.49s -> 16188.05s]  Is The Exorcist multiplayer?
[16188.05s -> 16191.11s]  Or is it just single player?
[16198.63s -> 16200.23s]  Exorcist VR is supposed to be legit.
[16201.67s -> 16206.48s]  I'm telling you, that Dread Halls was one of the most
[16206.48s -> 16208.96s]  nerve-wracking, stressful horror games I've ever played.
[16210.40s -> 16212.40s]  And yeah, I'm a little biased here
[16212.40s -> 16214.80s]  because it's one of the only VR horror games I've ever played.
[16215.44s -> 16218.48s]  But it was horrible.
[16218.48s -> 16221.68s]  Still going to do Mind Show?
[16221.68s -> 16221.92s]  Yes.
[16224.48s -> 16229.04s]  This co-op VR kind of couple of streams here in a row with Star.
[16230.15s -> 16231.03s]  They just kind of happened.
[16231.59s -> 16234.07s]  So my plan wasn't really part of the plan,
[16234.07s -> 16236.93s]  but we were just like, hey, let's do it.
[16239.72s -> 16242.20s]  But thank you Zombie Man for the five bucks.
[16242.20s -> 16244.12s]  Sorry, Jeremy, for the messages I was trying to send.
[16244.12s -> 16245.64s]  Cheers your way.
[16245.64s -> 16247.64s]  And they are right next to my friend invite.
[16248.45s -> 16249.09s]  No, it's fine.
[16249.09s -> 16249.81s]  Don't worry about it, man.
[16254.15s -> 16255.03s]  Thank you for the five bucks.
[16255.03s -> 16255.51s]  Appreciate it.
[16258.74s -> 16260.26s]  Miss Melon T, thanks for the two fifty.
[16261.25s -> 16263.73s]  It's really nice to draw some pixel art watching your streams,
[16263.73s -> 16264.45s]  Jeremy.
[16264.45s -> 16266.13s]  Glad to catch your streams when I'm not working.
[16266.13s -> 16269.57s]  Seriously appreciate the company from both you and the Discord chat.
[16270.37s -> 16273.88s]  Jeremy Hart, thank you.
[16277.04s -> 16279.60s]  If I could just kind of be in the background while you do some work,
[16279.60s -> 16281.12s]  that's awesome.
[16282.12s -> 16282.76s]  Glad you're hanging out.
[16282.76s -> 16283.96s]  Glad you can relax.
[16283.96s -> 16290.44s]  And we do have a pretty good Discord community.
[16290.44s -> 16291.75s]  You haven't joined it yet.
[16291.75s -> 16292.23s]  It is there.
[16292.23s -> 16292.79s]  It's available.
[16293.78s -> 16294.58s]  Open to the public.
[16295.44s -> 16297.04s]  There is one sub only room,
[16297.04s -> 16298.88s]  but the whole thing is open to the public.
[16301.99s -> 16304.37s]  Just good people there.
[16304.37s -> 16305.01s]  Discord.
[16305.57s -> 16309.08s]  Not discourse, discord.
[16309.08s -> 16310.84s]  But thank you, Miss Melon T.
[16311.56s -> 16313.56s]  And then Bloody Doctor gave fifty dollars earlier.
[16314.20s -> 16315.24s]  I missed it completely.
[16315.24s -> 16318.37s]  I don't have notifications on when I'm in VR.
[16318.93s -> 16322.13s]  Because I find it's hard to pull out and see.
[16323.01s -> 16324.45s]  So I don't have notifications on.
[16325.41s -> 16327.33s]  But if you do end up seeing this, Bloody Doctor,
[16327.33s -> 16328.85s]  thank you so much for the fifty fucking dollars.
[16328.85s -> 16331.84s]  It's a lot of money.
[16331.84s -> 16332.40s]  It means a lot.
[16336.10s -> 16338.02s]  The TJ, thanks for the five community subs.
[16341.89s -> 16343.25s]  They came in a few hours ago.
[16345.65s -> 16348.29s]  Then TJ, right after that, gave fifteen bucks.
[16348.29s -> 16351.62s]  Hey Jeremy, back again from overseas.
[16352.26s -> 16354.82s]  Showing my love again with the deployment cashola.
[16354.82s -> 16355.94s]  Have fun in VR, my dudes.
[16356.42s -> 16357.70s]  I'm off to my plane now.
[16357.70s -> 16359.14s]  We'll have to catch back up at the VOD.
[16359.78s -> 16360.82s]  Peace stream, boys.
[16361.38s -> 16364.02s]  Thank you so much.
[16364.02s -> 16364.50s]  Welcome back.
[16368.13s -> 16370.93s]  Yeah, I really appreciate the five community subs
[16370.93s -> 16371.89s]  and the fifteen bucks.
[16372.45s -> 16374.95s]  Thank you.
[16384.79s -> 16385.99s]  When's this shit start?
[16385.99s -> 16386.79s]  Let's party.
[16388.39s -> 16389.35s]  Sark.
[16389.35s -> 16391.33s]  What's up, Sark?
[16393.75s -> 16394.71s]  You want to play VR?
[16394.71s -> 16396.23s]  You want to do some VR bullshit?
[16396.23s -> 16396.71s]  I'm down.
[16397.80s -> 16401.64s]  But my eyes can only take like four to five hours though.
[16403.86s -> 16406.98s]  My brain can actually only handle it for like four hours.
[16406.98s -> 16412.74s]  It's good to see you again though.
[16412.74s -> 16414.08s]  Hope you're doing well, Sark.
[16414.64s -> 16418.72s]  Can we turn off the slow mode?
[16418.72s -> 16420.24s]  Yeah, we can probably turn it off now.
[16420.24s -> 16422.40s]  We're at the end of the stream.
[16422.40s -> 16425.89s]  Probably just dump slow mode.
[16428.10s -> 16430.26s]  I just puked when he said VR.
[16434.18s -> 16435.62s]  Can we turn up slow mode?
[16436.44s -> 16437.24s]  Now you don't have to turn it up.
[16440.29s -> 16442.21s]  Sports Bar VR has multiplayer games.
[16442.93s -> 16443.65s]  Probably check it out.
[16443.65s -> 16444.29s]  We have a list.
[16444.93s -> 16447.56s]  We picked, over the last day or two,
[16447.56s -> 16450.34s]  I've been just doing some research to find some good ones.
[16450.34s -> 16452.58s]  And there's a list of like fifteen games we have.
[16453.30s -> 16454.90s]  We sort of just kind of threw darts.
[16454.90s -> 16458.39s]  And we're like, that one, that one, that one, that one, and that one.
[16458.39s -> 16460.31s]  And that's what we'll have time to do, I guess.
[16460.95s -> 16462.23s]  So we'll do that again for tomorrow.
[16468.56s -> 16474.08s]  But thank you, Combine, for the five, six, seven, eight dollars and eighty-seven cents.
[16475.60s -> 16476.00s]  Thank you.
[16477.65s -> 16481.33s]  Why can't you do such a simple thing as walking, you absolute donut?
[16481.33s -> 16484.21s]  Please actually tell me, you absolute goddamn buffoon.
[16484.77s -> 16486.15s]  I love your videos, man.
[16486.15s -> 16486.47s]  Cheers.
[16488.71s -> 16491.99s]  Well, that was during the survive portion of the stream.
[16492.07s -> 16494.47s]  And I had like the arms moving thing set up.
[16494.47s -> 16498.72s]  And you saw, on screen, that it was really, really wonky.
[16498.72s -> 16500.88s]  It didn't work out as what I thought it was.
[16500.88s -> 16503.72s]  I changed and did just fine.
[16503.72s -> 16504.82s]  But thank you.
[16504.82s -> 16505.81s]  Appreciate it.
[16507.70s -> 16509.22s]  You absolute donut.
[16510.39s -> 16511.43s]  I'll move those words around.
[16511.43s -> 16514.47s]  It's fucking, you fucking absolute you nut.
[16515.03s -> 16515.99s]  I'm a unit.
[16515.99s -> 16517.49s]  I'm a you nut.
[16517.49s -> 16517.89s]  Thanks, man.
[16517.89s -> 16518.53s]  Appreciate that.
[16520.48s -> 16523.44s]  They also say your face brightens up my dull days whenever I come home from work.
[16524.55s -> 16526.87s]  Your presence gives me warmth like no other person
[16526.87s -> 16528.71s]  not even your father.
[16528.71s -> 16532.37s]  Jerma, I'm so proud of you and all of your brothers.
[16532.37s -> 16535.33s]  Jack, Jomi, Garrence, and little Jerma, my lovely boys.
[16535.33s -> 16537.41s]  You are my absolute champion of a boy.
[16537.41s -> 16538.69s]  You must come visit me sometime.
[16538.69s -> 16540.21s]  Sincerely, your loving, proud mother.
[16541.11s -> 16542.07s]  Combine.
[16542.07s -> 16545.24s]  PS, here's my social security number.
[16545.24s -> 16548.28s]  What are you doing?
[16548.28s -> 16548.68s]  Thank you.
[16549.91s -> 16550.55s]  Peaceful Haley.
[16550.55s -> 16552.15s]  Thanks for the 250, Peaceful Haley.
[16552.15s -> 16554.61s]  Hey, Jerma, today's stream was a lot of fun.
[16554.61s -> 16555.89s]  I couldn't stop laughing the whole time.
[16555.89s -> 16557.25s]  Anyways, hope all is well for you.
[16557.81s -> 16560.77s]  Have a good night, Jerma, and chat.
[16560.77s -> 16561.65s]  Thank you, Haley.
[16563.86s -> 16564.50s]  Always a pleasure.
[16564.50s -> 16565.22s]  Thank you.
[16565.22s -> 16567.75s]  Glad you had fun.
[16567.75s -> 16568.63s]  Read it.
[16568.63s -> 16568.95s]  Fine.
[16569.59s -> 16570.07s]  No.
[16570.07s -> 16570.71s]  No, it's a joke.
[16570.71s -> 16573.83s]  It's like J9858985.
[16573.83s -> 16575.83s]  I read that completely wrong.
[16575.83s -> 16576.63s]  I don't want to read that out loud.
[16576.63s -> 16580.29s]  What if it's real somehow?
[16580.29s -> 16583.49s]  Hey, Freudian Weapon, thanks for the 250.
[16583.49s -> 16585.25s]  Mostly lost, thanks for 250.
[16585.25s -> 16589.32s]  How are you so bad at Five Finger Filet and Red Dead Redemption
[16589.32s -> 16591.72s]  but you're perfect at it in a VR game?
[16591.72s -> 16594.05s]  Because that's just real life.
[16595.76s -> 16596.88s]  I could do that in real life.
[16596.88s -> 16603.17s]  Because I'm not physically lifting my hand up in Red Dead.
[16603.17s -> 16607.88s]  I'm doing like X, circle, square, triangle, X, circle, square,
[16607.88s -> 16609.72s]  triangle, square, square, square, triangle, X.
[16609.72s -> 16621.88s]  I just got a flash of Star doing like the crab walk in the drunk game.
[16621.88s -> 16631.40s]  Oh, this is so dumb.
[16632.36s -> 16633.80s]  But look, look, okay.
[16634.68s -> 16636.52s]  Yeah, that game is like a tuber game.
[16637.32s -> 16638.60s]  But sometimes that don't matter.
[16638.60s -> 16640.44s]  Sometimes that's all you need.
[16640.44s -> 16643.16s]  Just you and a buddy just being just dickheads in a game.
[16643.16s -> 16644.04s]  It's so much fun.
[16644.60s -> 16651.94s]  Sometimes that's actually all you need.
[16652.10s -> 16661.11s]  But thank you to Bloody Doctor again for the five bucks.
[16661.11s -> 16664.23s]  For the love of God, Jerma, your fly is down.
[16664.23s -> 16665.43s]  And they say Star Genius.
[16665.43s -> 16666.23s]  I'm sorry.
[16666.23s -> 16667.03s]  I don't have a fly.
[16667.03s -> 16668.63s]  I'm wearing jogging pants today.
[16669.43s -> 16673.73s]  Tuber, what the fuck?
[16674.29s -> 16676.77s]  Stark, it's not Mr. Stark.
[16676.77s -> 16678.53s]  Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good.
[16679.17s -> 16680.53s]  I don't after VR.
[16681.89s -> 16682.45s]  Mr. Stark.
[16683.33s -> 16685.35s]  Tuber is just a tuber.
[16688.80s -> 16689.44s]  Stark.
[16692.93s -> 16694.45s]  I don't know why I added T, I'm sorry.
[16698.31s -> 16701.03s]  I was wearing jogging pants, not a pair of jeans.
[16701.83s -> 16706.16s]  How could you play VR without a full workout gear on?
[16706.88s -> 16708.63s]  Like a hoodie and a pair of jeans.
[16710.36s -> 16711.96s]  Sweat would be dripping down my ass.
[16712.93s -> 16714.45s]  I would have to, it would be embarrassing.
[16714.45s -> 16715.89s]  I would turn around during the stream
[16716.53s -> 16722.13s]  and there would be two fucking huge wet handprint marks on my ass.
[16725.25s -> 16727.49s]  If I was in a pair of jeans, we'd go right through the jeans.
[16727.49s -> 16728.05s]  It'd be horrible.
[16728.77s -> 16730.21s]  I'd probably get like suspended.
[16736.16s -> 16738.08s]  Who's touching your, like me.
[16738.08s -> 16742.08s]  Like I'm grabbing and I'm doing an indentation on my jeans
[16743.24s -> 16746.12s]  and I'm going to grab and like move and push.
[16755.59s -> 16757.99s]  Thank you Nuke for the five community subs as well.
[16759.30s -> 16761.62s]  And then Nuke subscribed themselves.
[16761.62s -> 16763.86s]  So six subs there coming in.
[16763.86s -> 16764.58s]  Thank you for that.
[16765.14s -> 16766.37s]  It means a lot.
[16770.32s -> 16771.76s]  Timmy Tim Tam, thanks for the 250.
[16771.76s -> 16774.16s]  Hey, I think you could do with some comedy tips to be funnier.
[16774.72s -> 16777.20s]  Uh, check out this observational comedy master.
[16777.84s -> 16778.90s]  Is this me?
[16778.90s -> 16780.02s]  Are you linking a clip of me?
[16780.66s -> 16788.76s]  What the hell is this?
[16788.76s -> 16795.81s]  Why do, why, why do what a girl said fake mustaches?
[16795.81s -> 16796.69s]  What is this?
[16796.69s -> 16802.93s]  No, this is not the master of comedy.
[16802.93s -> 16805.25s]  This is, this is why do girls wear fake mustaches.
[16805.25s -> 16807.49s]  It's like a commentary video.
[16808.37s -> 16810.74s]  I don't know.
[16810.74s -> 16813.65s]  I show us.
[16815.01s -> 16815.89s]  I don't hold on.
[16822.04s -> 16823.56s]  No, I don't, I don't, I don't.
[16823.56s -> 16825.32s]  This is like somebody's like personal channel.
[16826.04s -> 16831.35s]  I don't like, I don't know if this is like, I don't know what you're doing.
[16835.75s -> 16836.71s]  Where'd the chat just go?
[16837.57s -> 16838.77s]  I lost you.
[16838.77s -> 16842.28s]  Where the hell did everybody go?
[16842.28s -> 16850.82s]  Oh, there you go.
[16850.82s -> 16851.30s]  There we go.
[16851.30s -> 16852.50s]  Now I can see why is it doing this?
[16852.50s -> 16853.62s]  Oh, it's because of OBI drop.
[16853.62s -> 16856.77s]  I see you could learn something.
[16856.77s -> 16857.97s]  I don't need to learn anything.
[16860.74s -> 16865.06s]  Comedy is just, it's whatever you want it to be.
[16869.48s -> 16870.84s]  If you think something's funny and I don't,
[16871.80s -> 16873.00s]  that's comedy for you, not for me.
[16880.00s -> 16880.88s]  That's not true.
[16881.68s -> 16882.96s]  I'm not making a joke.
[16882.96s -> 16883.46s]  All right.
[16884.00s -> 16891.01s]  All you need to know is I won the junior Massachusetts standup championship when I was 14.
[16892.39s -> 16897.78s]  I had an amazing bit about how water,
[16899.64s -> 16901.72s]  like why don't people just drink water out of the ocean?
[16903.96s -> 16906.04s]  And I got like a standing ovation.
[16906.04s -> 16907.24s]  I was 14.
[16907.24s -> 16908.28s]  I had like two jokes.
[16915.72s -> 16918.12s]  I did a thing where I was in a boat, like pretending to sail around.
[16918.12s -> 16919.48s]  It's like, oh my God, what are we?
[16919.48s -> 16921.96s]  I can't believe we're, we got no water left.
[16921.96s -> 16924.44s]  And again, it's like, you just drink the water in the ocean.
[16924.44s -> 16924.94s]  Dumb.
[16925.42s -> 16930.25s]  A guy in the front row had to go to the hospital
[16930.25s -> 16934.17s]  because he laughed so hard his face turned red and it turned purple.
[16934.97s -> 16940.89s]  He was like, and like 15 people had helped him out.
[16945.18s -> 16948.38s]  His family sued me after that for comedy negligence.
[16949.10s -> 16952.42s]  I had a great lawyer.
[16952.42s -> 16964.82s]  There's a rumor that you went to actual clown school.
[16965.46s -> 16968.02s]  Let me like hit that right in the,
[16968.02s -> 16970.26s]  let me like just cut the head off that snake here.
[16971.06s -> 16974.10s]  Um, yes, I went to clown college.
[16975.51s -> 16976.63s]  I know all the balloon animals.
[16976.63s -> 16978.71s]  I know dog, I know snake, I know cat.
[16981.56s -> 16982.52s]  I got the nose.
[16987.69s -> 16990.33s]  I graduated top of my class and in my senior project,
[16991.21s -> 16993.21s]  I did such an amazing balloon animal.
[16993.21s -> 16995.69s]  One of my instructors actually was sitting in the front row.
[16995.69s -> 16997.05s]  He was, I don't know if he was eating something,
[16997.05s -> 16999.45s]  but he was like, he couldn't believe how fast I did the balloon animal.
[16999.45s -> 17001.85s]  And he started fucking choking and laughing and like,
[17004.49s -> 17006.49s]  like fucking 10 paramedics had to come in.
[17008.57s -> 17009.45s]  I've almost killed him.
[17010.25s -> 17011.61s]  His family gets a fucking lawyer.
[17012.33s -> 17013.93s]  And that would be the second time that that's happened.
[17013.93s -> 17016.41s]  So I think I have a pretty good track record of making people laugh.
[17016.41s -> 17023.19s]  I did a balloon dog in like 1.2 seconds.
[17023.19s -> 17023.83s]  It was so fast.
[17023.83s -> 17024.55s]  He couldn't even handle it.
[17024.55s -> 17025.75s]  He was the instructor of the class.
[17029.35s -> 17031.11s]  Oh my God, I'm choking.
[17035.74s -> 17037.10s]  No, don't get your lawyer.
[17037.10s -> 17037.82s]  I got a good one.
[17050.92s -> 17052.12s]  Hey, what's the deal with water?
[17052.12s -> 17053.48s]  Why did you just drink it out of the ocean?
[17059.34s -> 17060.70s]  I was on the front page of Time Magazine.
[17062.02s -> 17063.38s]  Up and coming comedians.
[17063.38s -> 17063.94s]  That line.
[17065.32s -> 17066.36s]  Top text, bottom text.
[17067.00s -> 17068.12s]  And it was me going like this.
[17069.43s -> 17073.03s]  Like right into the, like here's the cover, right?
[17073.03s -> 17073.91s]  This is Time Magazine.
[17074.55s -> 17082.22s]  And I was like, and then the text was up here.
[17084.06s -> 17085.82s]  Why don't you just drink it out of the ocean?
[17085.82s -> 17089.99s]  And I was in a magician's outfit with like a tail and a tie.
[17090.79s -> 17102.25s]  Those were some great years.
[17102.81s -> 17112.49s]  Oh, he's a sad one.
[17112.49s -> 17113.29s]  All right, let's move on.
[17113.29s -> 17115.53s]  Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim for the 250.
[17115.53s -> 17118.57s]  That is the, what the God, we gotta start it on that.
[17118.57s -> 17120.78s]  You look like shit, man.
[17120.78s -> 17121.26s]  Yeah, I know.
[17123.77s -> 17125.37s]  I know how bad I look right now.
[17125.37s -> 17126.09s]  You think I don't know that?
[17127.80s -> 17130.36s]  I told you guys before, I gave up like years ago,
[17130.36s -> 17132.52s]  giving a shit about like looking good on camera.
[17138.87s -> 17142.71s]  No, I'm in the virtual world for four and a half hours.
[17142.71s -> 17143.35s]  This is what happens.
[17143.99s -> 17146.04s]  Am I gonna like cut the camera off
[17146.04s -> 17147.80s]  and go get my hair done and then come back and be like,
[17149.94s -> 17150.74s]  why would I be praying?
[17151.30s -> 17151.94s]  I don't know.
[17151.94s -> 17152.90s]  I don't know what that came.
[17152.90s -> 17154.34s]  Why would I have my hands in a prayer?
[17161.91s -> 17162.95s]  Gotta take care of your hair.
[17163.83s -> 17166.87s]  No, well after this, every post VR stream,
[17167.43s -> 17170.06s]  I go into the shower and I condition.
[17170.78s -> 17173.90s]  I let some nice warm water run through it for a little while
[17173.90s -> 17175.50s]  and then I get some nice conditioner,
[17176.06s -> 17179.02s]  let it sit in my hair for about 30 to 45 seconds.
[17179.02s -> 17180.06s]  Let it sit there, hang out.
[17181.96s -> 17184.76s]  I take the shower attachment off,
[17185.40s -> 17187.08s]  get it close and run it through,
[17188.78s -> 17192.22s]  pat, dry it, calm it with a brush and let it just sit there.
[17195.78s -> 17196.98s]  What's my opinion on taking baths?
[17196.98s -> 17199.06s]  I literally took one yesterday
[17200.68s -> 17203.48s]  and I put a turtle bath bomb in.
[17204.94s -> 17206.46s]  It was like a fizzy bath bomb.
[17208.02s -> 17208.82s]  It was wonderful.
[17208.82s -> 17209.86s]  It turned the water green.
[17210.42s -> 17222.33s]  Have you used the frog soap?
[17222.33s -> 17222.97s]  Not yet.
[17222.97s -> 17226.17s]  Frog soap is sitting out on a dish next to the bathtub.
[17228.02s -> 17228.74s]  I don't want to get rid of it.
[17228.74s -> 17229.54s]  I want to keep it there.
[17230.74s -> 17231.54s]  It's a set piece.
[17234.14s -> 17235.02s]  What's your favorite color?
[17237.02s -> 17237.50s]  Blue green.
[17245.10s -> 17245.90s]  Decorative soap.
[17245.90s -> 17252.68s]  Yes, it is.
[17252.68s -> 17254.12s]  You guys don't know what blue green is?
[17254.68s -> 17257.42s]  It's like the halfway point between blue and green.
[17261.90s -> 17263.18s]  Have I ever shit in a bath?
[17264.65s -> 17265.69s]  Yeah, everybody has.
[17267.27s -> 17269.67s]  Probably more than 20 or 30 times.
[17269.67s -> 17271.67s]  Because when you're between the ages of
[17273.24s -> 17274.84s]  three and six months,
[17274.84s -> 17276.36s]  you shit in the bathtub all the time.
[17277.08s -> 17280.87s]  Your parents just didn't tell you that.
[17280.87s -> 17285.19s]  Every single one of you has shit in a bathtub at least 10 times.
[17286.20s -> 17286.68s]  At least.
[17299.51s -> 17300.71s]  I'm not so sure.
[17301.35s -> 17302.23s]  No, of course you did.
[17309.14s -> 17311.06s]  Have I ever shit my pants as an adult?
[17311.06s -> 17311.56s]  Yes.
[17314.73s -> 17316.01s]  Isn't it embarrassing to say that?
[17321.34s -> 17326.47s]  People that tell you they don't believe anybody.
[17326.47s -> 17328.23s]  People pick their nose, they shit their pants,
[17328.23s -> 17329.99s]  they shit in the bathtub, they pee their pants,
[17329.99s -> 17332.07s]  they piss on the wall, they miss the toilet.
[17332.07s -> 17332.79s]  Everybody does this.
[17334.50s -> 17335.62s]  Get rid of the mask.
[17335.62s -> 17337.70s]  Take off the fucking facade here.
[17339.75s -> 17341.03s]  You pee on the seat sometimes.
[17341.03s -> 17342.81s]  You piss in the shower.
[17342.81s -> 17344.33s]  Can we stop this bullshit?
[17347.83s -> 17350.87s]  I don't want to go to Jerma's house.
[17350.87s -> 17351.83s]  It's a very clean house.
[17352.55s -> 17373.03s]  I came in a towel except to clean up after.
[17374.22s -> 17374.54s]  No.
[17374.54s -> 17378.86s]  All jokes aside, I have a very, very nice, well-kept environment.
[17379.50s -> 17383.59s]  Somebody just said something that I have to say out loud.
[17383.59s -> 17384.07s]  No, I'm not.
[17384.07s -> 17384.39s]  It's the one.
[17384.39s -> 17385.03s]  It's in all caps.
[17386.09s -> 17387.05s]  That's unbelievable.
[17387.05s -> 17387.93s]  That's insane.
[17388.81s -> 17390.33s]  I've never even thought about that before.
[17390.33s -> 17391.77s]  That's insanity.
[17391.77s -> 17392.81s]  I'm not going to read it out loud.
[17398.44s -> 17398.68s]  Wow.
[17400.54s -> 17401.26s]  That's so weird.
[17401.98s -> 17405.00s]  What the hell?
[17405.00s -> 17405.40s]  What was that?
[17405.40s -> 17406.44s]  Somebody just tried to post like a...
[17407.24s -> 17408.04s]  What the fuck was that?
[17408.68s -> 17409.96s]  It was in all caps.
[17409.96s -> 17410.84s]  You could just scroll back.
[17412.44s -> 17412.76s]  Thank you.
[17412.76s -> 17413.96s]  Mostly lost for the 250.
[17413.96s -> 17415.56s]  Mindshow should get its own full stream.
[17416.20s -> 17417.40s]  It's VR the movies.
[17417.40s -> 17417.64s]  Yeah.
[17418.94s -> 17420.94s]  I will give Mindshow the time it deserves.
[17423.16s -> 17426.04s]  That's why I haven't really done it yet.
[17426.04s -> 17432.22s]  Because I know I'm certain that I'm not going to want to just jump out of it.
[17432.86s -> 17439.08s]  Somebody already got it.
[17439.64s -> 17441.82s]  But yeah.
[17441.82s -> 17443.02s]  Mindshow will get the time it deserves.
[17443.75s -> 17444.47s]  Eventually here.
[17448.12s -> 17448.60s]  Eventually.
[17453.14s -> 17453.78s]  Thank you.
[17453.78s -> 17459.24s]  Shadow's One Disciple.
[17459.96s -> 17462.04s]  Do not say Shadow's One Discipline.
[17462.04s -> 17463.00s]  There is no end.
[17464.42s -> 17466.82s]  Shadow's One Disciple.
[17467.70s -> 17468.74s]  Thanks for the 250.
[17470.26s -> 17472.10s]  Anyway, I found this in the freezer.
[17472.66s -> 17475.40s]  What is this that you found?
[17475.40s -> 17482.46s]  Grill Master Eight Quarter Pound Patty.
[17483.18s -> 17486.02s]  Have you guys learned nothing from Gordon Ramsay?
[17486.98s -> 17491.22s]  Don't eat frozen patties.
[17491.86s -> 17497.19s]  Grill Master.
[17497.83s -> 17501.64s]  Patty Elitist here.
[17512.63s -> 17515.67s]  I asked you a question but you didn't reply.
[17515.67s -> 17516.47s]  Or other people too.
[17516.47s -> 17520.23s]  Don't ever think you're too Hollywood to reply to me or the people in your chat.
[17520.23s -> 17523.43s]  Never forget you're just a regular average guy who's just good at a video game.
[17523.43s -> 17524.39s]  Get out of your own ass.
[17524.95s -> 17527.93s]  I mean you get the first part there, right?
[17527.93s -> 17529.61s]  I'm not very good at video games though.
[17531.50s -> 17532.62s]  Good at a video game.
[17532.62s -> 17542.10s]  What video game?
[17542.10s -> 17543.78s]  Get out of your own ass.
[17543.78s -> 17544.98s]  I was pretty good in VR.
[17545.70s -> 17549.53s]  You put the patties in your fridge to keep the shape.
[17549.53s -> 17550.17s]  Are you kidding?
[17551.59s -> 17551.91s]  No.
[17551.91s -> 17553.43s]  You get fresh cut.
[17554.15s -> 17554.87s]  Bring it home.
[17554.95s -> 17557.78s]  Immediately cook them.
[17557.78s -> 17559.46s]  Not this re-refrigeration shit.
[17560.82s -> 17572.54s]  Step into the ground beef.
[17572.54s -> 17574.92s]  Can you cook?
[17574.92s -> 17575.80s]  Went to culinary school.
[17576.52s -> 17577.56s]  I think I know a thing or two.
[17579.80s -> 17581.72s]  I mean I'd not like to say that.
[17582.44s -> 17586.22s]  It was a double school.
[17586.22s -> 17587.82s]  It was a culinary clown school.
[17588.38s -> 17593.99s]  The balloon animals we made, we ate them afterwards.
[17593.99s -> 17600.39s]  Balloon chicken.
[17602.57s -> 17603.53s]  Balloon cows.
[17603.53s -> 17604.97s]  Balloon turkeys.
[17604.97s -> 17605.61s]  Balloon snakes.
[17612.81s -> 17614.73s]  Use every part of the balloon animal.
[17614.73s -> 17615.13s]  That's right.
[17617.69s -> 17619.21s]  But thank you, shadows.
[17619.45s -> 17620.65s]  Discycle for the 250.
[17622.90s -> 17623.86s]  Thank you, kimchi.
[17623.86s -> 17624.90s]  Kimchi for the 10 bucks.
[17625.70s -> 17626.98s]  I was broke, now I'm not.
[17626.98s -> 17627.70s]  Here's some money.
[17628.26s -> 17629.46s]  You're the only streamer I watch.
[17629.46s -> 17630.90s]  Thank you for always doing so much for us
[17630.90s -> 17631.78s]  and making the best streams.
[17635.19s -> 17635.91s]  Thank you, kimchi.
[17638.12s -> 17641.30s]  I just aim to have fun.
[17642.02s -> 17645.46s]  Hopefully you guys think the same.
[17647.78s -> 17650.97s]  I'm just trying to have a good time.
[17650.97s -> 17651.69s]  That's all.
[17651.69s -> 17654.04s]  Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[17655.99s -> 17658.15s]  I'm honored to be the only person that you watch.
[17658.79s -> 17659.19s]  Thank you.
[17662.65s -> 17663.29s]  Tingy, thank you.
[17663.29s -> 17664.17s]  Tingy to the 250.
[17665.82s -> 17667.58s]  So James got a kick out of one of your emotes
[17667.58s -> 17669.26s]  after seeing it in his chat.
[17669.26s -> 17671.02s]  I think it's safe to say that he liked it.
[17674.07s -> 17674.71s]  Oh, wait.
[17675.27s -> 17675.75s]  Oh, I see.
[17675.75s -> 17676.15s]  Hold on.
[17676.79s -> 17677.51s]  Can you guys hear that?
[17677.51s -> 17680.26s]  I have to change my desktop audio.
[17680.98s -> 17684.81s]  Let's see if we can hear this now.
[17685.45s -> 17686.95s]  Can we hear this now?
[17687.67s -> 17688.39s]  Yes, we can.
[17688.39s -> 17689.75s]  And that was so loud.
[17689.75s -> 17691.03s]  I'm so sorry again.
[17692.07s -> 17692.81s]  All right, let's see.
[17693.45s -> 17693.77s]  What is it?
[17693.77s -> 17694.25s]  It's a clip.
[17697.77s -> 17699.78s]  What's he playing?
[17700.34s -> 17702.04s]  Metro Exodus.
[17703.21s -> 17704.97s]  Uh, if you haven't played Metro Exodus,
[17706.14s -> 17707.82s]  I might not look at the screen for a little,
[17707.82s -> 17709.74s]  for like 30 to 40 seconds.
[17710.86s -> 17711.99s]  That was way louder.
[17711.99s -> 17712.79s]  He's getting closer.
[17713.51s -> 17720.18s]  He's getting closer.
[17720.18s -> 17725.42s]  Let's see.
[17725.42s -> 17727.02s]  Let's take a look.
[17727.02s -> 17731.86s]  The guy sounds like Willem Dafoe.
[17733.46s -> 17734.42s]  The voice actor.
[17735.94s -> 17736.90s]  Green Goblin, dude.
[17748.33s -> 17750.81s]  Ew, what is that fucking emo, dude?
[17750.81s -> 17752.65s]  Is that a fucking Jerma emo,
[17752.65s -> 17754.09s]  but it's also Willem Dafoe?
[17756.09s -> 17757.77s]  What the fuck is that emo?
[17763.37s -> 17764.97s]  I never would have pieced that together
[17764.97s -> 17766.09s]  that he looks like,
[17766.09s -> 17767.29s]  that he looks like him.
[17770.36s -> 17771.48s]  Oh, that's funny.
[17771.48s -> 17777.34s]  I'm pretty proud of things.
[17777.34s -> 17778.62s]  I'm such a fucking weirdo.
[17792.71s -> 17793.35s]  Thank you for that.
[17797.83s -> 17798.79s]  Well, you are.
[17798.79s -> 17802.62s]  I mean, they're back.
[17803.26s -> 17809.46s]  That person better be like spreading magical cheer
[17809.46s -> 17811.22s]  like Santa Claus shit out their car.
[17811.94s -> 17813.86s]  I will not be upset anymore about this.
[17814.42s -> 17816.42s]  If that guy has like a bag of magic sand
[17816.42s -> 17817.14s]  that he's throwing out
[17817.14s -> 17819.38s]  and it like has good luck charms in it for everybody.
[17824.30s -> 17824.94s]  Every day.
[17827.00s -> 17828.12s]  Uh, Clueless Sniper,
[17828.12s -> 17829.72s]  thanks for the 250.
[17830.60s -> 17831.08s]  250.
[17831.72s -> 17834.73s]  Thanks.
[17834.73s -> 17838.06s]  Uh, thank you also to Strawberry Pulp
[17838.70s -> 17841.42s]  for the 10 bucks.
[17841.42s -> 17842.86s]  10 dollars from Strawberry Pulp.
[17843.58s -> 17844.84s]  This might sound silly,
[17844.84s -> 17846.44s]  but I had kind of a crappy week in this room
[17846.44s -> 17847.32s]  really helped cheer me up.
[17847.96s -> 17849.32s]  Thanks for everything you do.
[17849.32s -> 17849.88s]  Sure my heart.
[17853.58s -> 17855.10s]  I'm sorry you're not having a good week,
[17857.06s -> 17859.46s]  but, uh, as sorry as I am
[17859.46s -> 17860.66s]  that you're not having a good week,
[17861.38s -> 17863.83s]  I am happy that you can come here
[17863.83s -> 17864.79s]  and hang out and have a good time.
[17865.80s -> 17868.52s]  That'll make you possibly not think about any bullshit.
[17868.52s -> 17870.90s]  You know what I mean?
[17870.90s -> 17872.26s]  Thank you for the 10 bucks, Strawberry Pulp.
[17879.37s -> 17879.77s]  Take care.
[17879.77s -> 17880.09s]  Thank you.
[17882.78s -> 17883.74s]  Uh, Growdiv.
[17883.74s -> 17885.10s]  Thank you Growdiv for the five bucks.
[17886.39s -> 17888.23s]  Check out Wildlands 2.
[17888.79s -> 17891.11s]  It has multiplayer and similar vibes to Jet Island,
[17891.11s -> 17892.79s]  but more focused on rope swinging.
[17892.79s -> 17893.35s]  Is it VR?
[17893.99s -> 17894.79s]  I'm assuming it is.
[17895.51s -> 17903.14s]  There's so much VR.
[17903.86s -> 17906.02s]  I've got such a backlog.
[17906.02s -> 17907.30s]  It's, it's overwhelming.
[17909.59s -> 17910.31s]  Windlands.
[17910.31s -> 17911.35s]  No, did I say wild?
[17911.35s -> 17912.87s]  Oh, I said Wildlands.
[17913.51s -> 17914.47s]  Windlands.
[17915.19s -> 17916.92s]  Uh, there I go,
[17916.92s -> 17918.60s]  adding another letter for no reason.
[17919.16s -> 17922.82s]  I still have to go back and beat Jet Island.
[17922.82s -> 17923.38s]  I was close.
[17923.38s -> 17925.06s]  I was only a couple hours away, wasn't I?
[17925.86s -> 17935.93s]  But thank you Growdiv for the five dollars and the suggestion.
[17937.27s -> 17938.15s]  I want to play it all.
[17938.15s -> 17938.87s]  I want to see it all.
[17943.08s -> 17944.52s]  Mostly lost thanks to the 250.
[17945.08s -> 17947.50s]  The stupid shit you and Stir were doing in these games
[17947.50s -> 17949.50s]  reminds me of the shenanigans you two did in TF2
[17949.50s -> 17950.38s]  and it made me happy.
[17955.18s -> 17957.94s]  Yeah, I mean, like I said, anytime you get,
[17957.94s -> 17961.08s]  like, buddy together and you just,
[17962.06s -> 17963.98s]  the purpose is just to have fun.
[17965.51s -> 17966.63s]  There's nothing else there.
[17966.63s -> 17970.68s]  It's just, I want to do something
[17970.68s -> 17971.56s]  and just have a good time.
[17971.56s -> 17971.96s]  That's it.
[17972.84s -> 17976.98s]  It's always, it's always a good time,
[17977.62s -> 17980.07s]  you know, when stars are down.
[17980.07s -> 17982.15s]  You'll see him tomorrow.
[17984.10s -> 17986.34s]  I love beating people at the bar with my buddy.
[17987.06s -> 17989.46s]  I love throwing glass at people's faces,
[17989.46s -> 17990.34s]  you know, with my friend.
[17991.22s -> 17992.90s]  Hitting guitars over people's heads.
[17998.71s -> 18000.95s]  Pretending to smoke the same cigarette
[18000.95s -> 18002.71s]  30 times and burn it on someone.
[18002.71s -> 18008.23s]  Yeah, with a friend.
[18008.23s -> 18008.79s]  It's come on.
[18008.79s -> 18009.99s]  It's just, it's a blast.
[18014.15s -> 18015.59s]  But thank you mostly lost for sure.
[18016.15s -> 18019.85s]  Am I going to want other people
[18019.85s -> 18021.69s]  to join us in Pavlov tomorrow?
[18021.69s -> 18022.17s]  I don't know.
[18031.05s -> 18032.01s]  How big are the lobbies?
[18035.10s -> 18036.46s]  Is it a big lobby system?
[18036.46s -> 18037.50s]  Is it like 12 players?
[18037.50s -> 18038.06s]  How many players?
[18039.53s -> 18039.77s]  10?
[18041.58s -> 18042.78s]  Yeah, maybe we can get something going.
[18046.23s -> 18047.67s]  I'll try to get like one of those
[18047.67s -> 18049.75s]  chat roulette system things.
[18050.55s -> 18052.07s]  Maybe we'll play like a handful of games
[18052.07s -> 18053.11s]  with subs or something.
[18053.75s -> 18054.55s]  That'll be fun.
[18057.58s -> 18058.06s]  I have it.
[18058.06s -> 18059.58s]  If you need a sharpshooter.
[18065.24s -> 18066.36s]  Really loving the VR streams,
[18066.36s -> 18067.96s]  even if I don't chat a lot.
[18067.96s -> 18069.58s]  I'm glad you like them.
[18071.24s -> 18071.96s]  I'm going to keep doing them.
[18072.76s -> 18074.12s]  I'm going to keep doing them
[18074.12s -> 18075.56s]  until I am satisfied.
[18076.79s -> 18077.75s]  And I'm still interested
[18077.75s -> 18078.71s]  and still very satisfied.
[18078.71s -> 18083.99s]  So we're going to keep going chat.
[18083.99s -> 18085.03s]  No, like a chat,
[18086.12s -> 18088.36s]  a roulette based raffle chat system.
[18089.08s -> 18093.53s]  Yeah, we'll have,
[18093.53s -> 18095.38s]  we'll get something going.
[18095.38s -> 18096.50s]  Hey, Novi333.
[18096.50s -> 18098.18s]  Thanks for the 333.
[18098.18s -> 18099.61s]  Free dolls and 33 songs.
[18101.24s -> 18101.56s]  Thank you.
[18104.65s -> 18105.37s]  No message.
[18105.37s -> 18105.77s]  That's it.
[18105.77s -> 18106.41s]  Thank you so much.
[18108.76s -> 18109.48s]  Timmy Tim Tim.
[18109.48s -> 18110.28s]  Thanks for the 250.
[18110.92s -> 18111.72s]  Can you tell the story
[18111.72s -> 18112.84s]  where you ate a pack of Oreos
[18112.84s -> 18114.20s]  and puked in your mother's bed?
[18118.28s -> 18119.32s]  No, isn't there a clip
[18119.32s -> 18120.28s]  lying around somewhere
[18121.56s -> 18123.48s]  from two years ago of me doing this?
[18124.12s -> 18125.40s]  And then didn't I say clip this?
[18125.40s -> 18126.60s]  So anytime anybody says this
[18126.60s -> 18127.24s]  to just to have it.
[18127.88s -> 18131.48s]  I just it's it's somewhere it exists.
[18132.28s -> 18136.09s]  How many times have I had that clipped
[18136.09s -> 18137.05s]  and said, hey, bring this up
[18137.05s -> 18138.49s]  when somebody fucking comes in here
[18138.49s -> 18140.65s]  and it says to give the Oreos.
[18140.65s -> 18144.14s]  Tell the story when you slapped
[18144.14s -> 18145.18s]  yourself in the face live.
[18145.82s -> 18147.29s]  Embarrassment.
[18160.94s -> 18161.74s]  But thank you.
[18163.00s -> 18164.28s]  And I'm going to run the credits.
[18164.28s -> 18165.56s]  We have another couple bits to do,
[18165.56s -> 18166.60s]  but I'm going to preemptively
[18166.60s -> 18167.08s]  get them rolling.
[18167.08s -> 18167.80s]  These are all the subs
[18167.80s -> 18169.16s]  and the resubs that came in today
[18169.88s -> 18170.68s]  during this stream.
[18173.08s -> 18174.76s]  Thank you for the continued support, everybody.
[18174.76s -> 18175.32s]  Means a lot.
[18175.32s -> 18175.96s]  You guys are awesome.
[18179.58s -> 18180.70s]  Thank you, everybody.
[18183.80s -> 18186.28s]  There are trillions of subscribers now.
[18196.57s -> 18197.45s]  I have a game in VR
[18197.45s -> 18198.73s]  that might be Resident Sleeper.
[18198.73s -> 18199.29s]  I don't know.
[18199.29s -> 18200.73s]  It's called Iron Wolf VR.
[18202.25s -> 18203.61s]  That's actually was on the list.
[18203.61s -> 18204.33s]  We were looking at it.
[18204.97s -> 18213.34s]  Sure, but please answer the question.
[18214.26s -> 18215.06s]  Just answer the question.
[18215.06s -> 18217.94s]  But we don't we don't demand things
[18217.94s -> 18218.74s]  from the streamer.
[18220.04s -> 18220.76s]  Exquisite.
[18221.40s -> 18235.80s]  I honestly only come
[18235.80s -> 18236.76s]  for the end of the stream.
[18236.76s -> 18238.57s]  Well, welcome.
[18239.38s -> 18240.18s]  And also goodbye.
[18243.80s -> 18244.92s]  Tingy had 250 here.
[18245.72s -> 18247.00s]  You is the immediate reaction
[18247.00s -> 18248.04s]  to most emotes on Twitch
[18248.04s -> 18249.24s]  that are somewhat distorted.
[18249.80s -> 18250.76s]  I love all you emotes
[18250.76s -> 18251.48s]  because of that reason
[18251.48s -> 18252.36s]  it makes them unique,
[18252.36s -> 18253.24s]  just like you.
[18253.24s -> 18253.80s]  Hey, thank you.
[18255.45s -> 18257.05s]  Now, I'm well aware that my some
[18257.05s -> 18258.49s]  at least half of my emotes
[18258.49s -> 18259.29s]  are dog shit.
[18260.86s -> 18261.82s]  Half those planets
[18262.62s -> 18263.74s]  should have been deleted
[18263.74s -> 18264.78s]  three years ago.
[18264.78s -> 18266.30s]  But no, I'm going to leave them.
[18268.89s -> 18269.93s]  Like German mustard
[18269.93s -> 18271.45s]  is what I would classify
[18271.45s -> 18272.89s]  as a dog shit emo.
[18281.66s -> 18282.46s]  It just is.
[18282.46s -> 18283.42s]  I write you.
[18283.42s -> 18283.98s]  I like it.
[18283.98s -> 18285.34s]  I love all my emotes.
[18285.34s -> 18289.66s]  I have a personal, loving relationship.
[18289.66s -> 18291.74s]  I have a great relationship
[18291.74s -> 18292.78s]  with all my emotes.
[18294.78s -> 18295.66s]  But some of them are
[18299.21s -> 18300.49s]  thrown together, we'll say.
[18304.23s -> 18305.67s]  Flustered because mustard.
[18308.78s -> 18310.14s]  Like, for instance, OK, hold on.
[18310.14s -> 18310.78s]  So for instance,
[18311.96s -> 18315.40s]  German one guy is just a
[18315.40s -> 18322.30s]  just a little shitty paint drawing.
[18322.30s -> 18323.34s]  German nose wipe
[18323.34s -> 18325.50s]  is a terrible dab emote.
[18326.57s -> 18327.85s]  It's a dab emote.
[18328.57s -> 18329.61s]  And it was it was voted
[18329.61s -> 18330.41s]  because of that reason,
[18330.41s -> 18332.09s]  because it's a dab emote.
[18332.09s -> 18344.54s]  German mustard, German moon
[18344.54s -> 18346.06s]  is my first emote ever.
[18346.06s -> 18349.10s]  And it's like I was intentionally
[18349.10s -> 18350.14s]  trying to have an emote
[18350.14s -> 18350.78s]  that was awful.
[18352.66s -> 18353.70s]  I love it, though.
[18353.70s -> 18356.54s]  That's my favorite emote.
[18356.54s -> 18358.30s]  This is by far my favorite emote
[18359.11s -> 18360.95s]  on the site.
[18360.95s -> 18361.43s]  I'm sorry.
[18361.43s -> 18361.91s]  It just is.
[18362.47s -> 18364.42s]  I don't think anybody has
[18364.42s -> 18365.54s]  one that can compare.
[18365.54s -> 18368.86s]  And I'll stand on the
[18368.86s -> 18369.98s]  eagle maniac hill here.
[18369.98s -> 18371.90s]  That's why I love that emo.
[18371.90s -> 18374.28s]  God, what a beautiful emo.
[18376.71s -> 18378.39s]  I say that because it's my face.
[18378.39s -> 18378.87s]  It's me.
[18379.67s -> 18383.88s]  I hope you guys don't
[18383.88s -> 18384.84s]  take me that seriously.
[18384.84s -> 18385.48s]  You definitely don't.
[18386.90s -> 18387.46s]  Timmy, Tim, Tim.
[18387.46s -> 18388.18s]  Thanks for the 250.
[18388.18s -> 18389.94s]  Tell the story so we can clip it.
[18389.94s -> 18392.57s]  Was sick one day.
[18392.57s -> 18393.69s]  Decided to eat Oreos.
[18394.82s -> 18395.86s]  Did the thing where you got up
[18395.86s -> 18397.46s]  and tried to move around
[18397.46s -> 18398.58s]  while being sick to your stomach.
[18398.58s -> 18399.38s]  Got up too fast.
[18400.28s -> 18401.16s]  Had too many Oreos.
[18401.16s -> 18401.72s]  A whole sleeve.
[18402.36s -> 18404.07s]  Wanted to ask my mother
[18404.07s -> 18405.51s]  a question or something.
[18405.51s -> 18405.83s]  I don't know.
[18405.83s -> 18407.51s]  The story is getting hazy
[18407.51s -> 18408.31s]  over all these years.
[18408.95s -> 18410.23s]  It was very fresh in my mind
[18410.23s -> 18411.75s]  when I told it the first time.
[18411.75s -> 18412.79s]  So go up to my mother
[18412.79s -> 18413.59s]  to ask a question.
[18413.59s -> 18415.11s]  Get that closed in.
[18415.11s -> 18416.31s]  The world's going to fall down
[18416.31s -> 18417.35s]  on top of you.
[18417.35s -> 18419.21s]  Blackout feeling.
[18419.21s -> 18420.89s]  Lie back in my mother's bed
[18420.89s -> 18422.65s]  and throw up all over it.
[18422.65s -> 18427.26s]  The whole sleeve.
[18427.26s -> 18428.06s]  No, no, no.
[18428.06s -> 18428.94s]  Like one of the.
[18428.94s -> 18430.62s]  This is like this three sleeves
[18430.62s -> 18432.06s]  per Oreo container.
[18435.14s -> 18438.10s]  One of those sections.
[18438.10s -> 18441.22s]  Probably 12 to 14 cookies.
[18441.22s -> 18444.41s]  Why did you eat Oreos
[18444.41s -> 18444.97s]  if you were sick?
[18444.97s -> 18445.37s]  I don't know.
[18448.07s -> 18450.07s]  Why does anybody ever eat Oreos?
[18450.07s -> 18451.30s]  For any reason.
[18451.86s -> 18453.99s]  Can you guys reliably
[18453.99s -> 18454.71s]  think of a scenario
[18454.71s -> 18456.31s]  where eating like a bunch of Oreos
[18456.31s -> 18456.87s]  is a good idea?
[18459.99s -> 18461.03s]  They just taste good.
[18461.67s -> 18469.96s]  And they're easy to eat.
[18469.96s -> 18471.00s]  Oreos are great.
[18471.00s -> 18471.48s]  Fuck you.
[18472.20s -> 18473.24s]  I also agree.
[18473.24s -> 18474.76s]  I think Oreos are fantastic.
[18479.48s -> 18480.44s]  But if like you.
[18480.44s -> 18482.04s]  The light bulb goes off like.
[18483.51s -> 18484.87s]  I'm going to eat 12 Oreos.
[18486.98s -> 18488.66s]  It's never really a great idea.
[18494.54s -> 18496.70s]  Oreo serving size is three.
[18496.70s -> 18498.14s]  You're eating 30 times
[18498.14s -> 18498.94s]  the serving size.
[18501.05s -> 18501.77s]  Hey, Kirby Heart.
[18501.77s -> 18503.43s]  Thanks for the four dollars.
[18503.43s -> 18505.11s]  Thanks for streaming on my birthday.
[18505.19s -> 18506.07s]  Love your streams.
[18506.07s -> 18506.79s]  Happy birthday.
[18507.53s -> 18508.25s]  Kirby, thank you.
[18510.86s -> 18511.66s]  Kirby Heart.
[18511.66s -> 18515.27s]  Did you ever replace her bed after that?
[18515.27s -> 18517.03s]  No, we just sprayed it a shitload with a hose
[18517.03s -> 18517.83s]  and then let it dry
[18517.83s -> 18518.55s]  and then flipped it over.
[18523.86s -> 18532.41s]  And that's my time.
[18532.41s -> 18533.29s]  That's going to be it for me.
[18534.01s -> 18541.48s]  Cliff both parts.
[18545.11s -> 18546.15s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[18547.43s -> 18548.31s]  Have a great night.
[18553.59s -> 18554.09s]  Now.
[18555.19s -> 18557.03s]  Now half of you go to Nova
[18557.03s -> 18558.63s]  and half of you go to Italics.
[18558.63s -> 18559.69s]  Those are the only two people
[18559.69s -> 18561.29s]  that are streaming right now that I see.
[18562.09s -> 18565.50s]  Go say hello.
[18565.50s -> 18571.30s]  And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[18571.30s -> 18574.34s]  Bright and early at like 330, 4 p.m. Pacific.
[18579.69s -> 18580.57s]  Take care, guys.
