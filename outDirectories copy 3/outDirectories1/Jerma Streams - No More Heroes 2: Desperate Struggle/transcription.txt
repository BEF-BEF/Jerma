[0.76s -> 10.73s]  And I came up with a much better title in my tweet. Oh well, this was a much better one.
[12.54s -> 24.57s]  It's okay. It's too early. I'm right on time. 3 59. I just rang your doorbell.
[25.13s -> 33.70s]  You looked at your watch. Holy shit. I'm not going to step into your house until exactly four o'clock.
[35.35s -> 41.83s]  And hello. How are you? Hey, you ordered me. German on eight five. Hey, come on. If I come in for it,
[41.83s -> 49.27s]  I got to get in there exactly this time. Everyone riot. What are you doing? Don't wait. Don't be
[49.27s -> 67.48s]  them. Hey, no, not right off the bat. You're an escort. Okay, I got to relax. Hey, what's going on
[67.48s -> 77.96s]  with me? Did you order me? German on eight five. Oh my God. No, it's it's me coming to your birthday.
[78.04s -> 90.76s]  Fuck, I can't today. They were in play no more heroes to when I've been putting off for a long
[90.76s -> 103.27s]  time. When did I play no more heroes? One. What do you know? I said I was going to play this
[104.31s -> 111.59s]  probably 200 or 300 times. Since about three months ago. Yeah. This has been the game I said
[111.59s -> 124.33s]  was going to happen next week for three months. So I'm playing it. Here we are. That's based.
[125.05s -> 131.82s]  Vito this shit. No, if I was going to veto it, I would have vetoed. No, you can't. Not everything
[131.82s -> 139.64s]  in this stream is a veto. You guys get one make the streamer angry enough to turn his stream off
[139.64s -> 152.09s]  once every six months. That's not happening today. Beautiful Joe. I got beautiful Joe too back here.
[152.09s -> 159.90s]  What am I going to do with it? I'm going to have to display it on the shelf. But yeah, let's let's
[159.90s -> 168.81s]  get started. This is no more heroes to welcome to a new week. We had a good weekend. We should be
[168.81s -> 177.48s]  live here. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. All right. For a second, I saw I thought I saw
[177.48s -> 184.04s]  Kim's name go by doing German walk German walk and something about the Drew crew. I was like,
[184.04s -> 187.24s]  I don't even know. I don't think she even knows what that is. I was going to say what the hell
[187.24s -> 196.62s]  how that quickly like why is Kim doing the German walk? Anyways, let's get started. This is no more
[196.62s -> 203.64s]  heroes to welcome. We're going to play. I love this game. I don't actually remember this game
[203.64s -> 208.62s]  as much as I remember the first one. I very vividly remember though almost the whole first
[208.62s -> 223.30s]  game. Not this one. Let's see. Give it a look. The music is good. Yes. Oh, I know.
[224.02s -> 241.11s]  We watched the opening cutscene. Should I just skip it? Don't ever skip. Once a god-forsaken city
[241.11s -> 248.70s]  where the bodies of angels littered the streets. Much has changed in Santa Destroy. Giant
[248.70s -> 254.38s]  corporations. Rampant city development. The assassin's underworld has become a commodity.
[255.18s -> 261.82s]  A chance for profit and entertainment for the masses. Colonel. But shadows from the wilder
[261.82s -> 269.62s]  days still linger. Or grandpa. A man who slashed his wing to the top then walked away has become
[269.62s -> 277.75s]  an urban legend many even doubt was real. Here, the strong devour the weak. The weak kneel before
[277.75s -> 285.75s]  the strong. And those who wield true power watch and count their gold. When's the third game come
[285.75s -> 290.23s]  up? And in this mass-produced savagery, one truth is constant. It's here, right? With each shattered
[290.23s -> 298.79s]  life, the same vow as others. I will have revenge. Tomorrow? And no assassin can ever walk away from
[298.79s -> 308.15s]  that. He must draw his beam and stand against the madness. This is Travis Touchdown's desperate
[308.15s -> 315.03s]  struggle. Hold it, you violence-loving bastard. Before you start your desperate struggling,
[315.59s -> 325.45s]  you should drop a nice save. Travis, I already did. What I did before the stream turned on.
[326.25s -> 334.09s]  Oh, I saved my game at the beginning of the stream. What happens? Well, do I have to start
[334.09s -> 354.58s]  back at the beginning again? Holy shit, saving in real life would suck. Why? Yes, it would.
[355.30s -> 358.78s]  Because then you would just second guess literally everything you've ever done.
[360.47s -> 366.79s]  You would have so many save files in your brain back to when you were fucking 14. Should I pick
[366.79s -> 374.74s]  the french fries? Or should I pick the casserole? Um, let me save it here first. And half these
[374.74s -> 378.26s]  people wouldn't delete their saves. You would accidentally load a save in your 40s. That was
[378.26s -> 384.63s]  from you when you were 17. And you'd just fucking wake up in like your 17, 18-year-old, 16-year-old,
[384.63s -> 389.54s]  whatever body, just like, duh, what happened? But no, but you wouldn't even remember anything.
[389.54s -> 394.39s]  Right, because that's how a save would work, right? You wouldn't remember the forward. You would just
[394.39s -> 401.54s]  be screaming, knowing you were going back. You'd hit the button and go back to like 14 to be like,
[405.61s -> 417.42s]  teenage me. I can't pick. I'm not going to sweep. I'll never forget. Quick load accidentally. Yeah.
[417.42s -> 427.78s]  Night for the first time in 120 years, snow fell on center destroy. It was a sign. Nice fetish.
[428.58s -> 434.98s]  Another change, both beautiful and deadly. Making a shitload of save files in your head is
[435.70s -> 452.50s]  what? Yeah, you guys would not want that. You would retake your driver's test a thousand times
[452.50s -> 457.46s]  to make sure you got an S rating on it. You don't think of everything you've ever done and how many
[457.46s -> 463.62s]  times you've gone back to save points to fix even, even like the smallest thing. I didn't do that
[463.62s -> 467.46s]  good enough. I'm going to restart that. I could get like 10 more EXPs. It's called fashionably late
[467.46s -> 480.73s]  fuckface Travis touchdown. This place bring back any memories. It's only where my last killing spree
[480.73s -> 488.66s]  started. All those screwed up with that one. Now, why would I remember that? It'll be your blood this
[488.66s -> 497.70s]  time when I avenge my brother draw. That's cool. And who don't you remember the man you fought here?
[498.42s -> 505.99s]  Um, no, can't say I do. Guess he didn't make an impression. It must have been crazy weak.
[506.55s -> 513.03s]  You insensitive prick. You killed him and you don't even remember. You know how humiliating that is.
[515.58s -> 524.23s]  Sorry, I don't have a death diary. And in case you're wondering, I'm even stronger now. You will
[524.23s -> 527.43s]  lose. You've got no chance of winning this.
[529.43s -> 533.59s]  You're something else. I haven't been. It's been too long Travis.
[533.59s -> 538.07s]  When you see your bro in hell, tell him he's still a douche.
[544.25s -> 558.63s]  There we go. High strike, low strike. I like the scenery of be as high strike attack,
[559.27s -> 562.44s]  up or down.
[570.28s -> 571.32s]  Z is lock on, right?
[574.36s -> 576.76s]  Uh, beam katana recharge to shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.
[582.09s -> 584.81s]  I don't think I need it right now. Okay, emergency. Yeah, there's a dodge.
[585.37s -> 588.38s]  Why is he not doing it?
[591.58s -> 595.02s]  Oh, yes. I remember how much fun it was.
[605.35s -> 608.07s]  Swing the remote while running is a running slash. Yeah.
[610.31s -> 617.67s]  This guy sucks. Reset the camera.
[618.47s -> 623.27s]  Oh, the batteries on the other side. Right. Right. Right. Right.
[625.88s -> 628.76s]  Button mashing recover from take down. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[633.64s -> 641.72s]  Take so much longer in this one. What? Oh my God. It takes forever.
[642.84s -> 647.22s]  I don't remember it taking that long. What the fuck?
[647.30s -> 654.66s]  Press B when you're down enemy. Yeah.
[665.14s -> 673.24s]  Just reload your save side. You know, many times I would restart streams.
[674.36s -> 679.54s]  I was like, think about how many times you've taken a Photoshop of my face.
[679.54s -> 682.98s]  I've taken a screenshot of my face. I would have just, I would just have like every five minutes,
[682.98s -> 686.97s]  a quick save. It would take me like six hours to stream three hours.
[693.18s -> 697.42s]  Then you'd be kind of boring though. Wouldn't add, wouldn't I? If I went back and corrected
[697.42s -> 701.66s]  every dumb thing I've ever said on every stream, I would just kind of just,
[702.55s -> 715.42s]  your experience would just kind of be like this. There's a door. Number 13. Excellent choice.
[715.42s -> 748.12s]  But there's a guy over here on the right. Stream scumming. Oh God.
[751.98s -> 759.38s]  Where did that cigarette? By the way, what's with the filter on that cigarette? It's half the
[759.38s -> 770.15s]  cigarette. So what should I tell you this time? Extra filter. It means it's less bad for you.
[776.02s -> 778.58s]  At some points, everyone's getting ripped off paying for filters.
[800.63s -> 806.23s]  This is me on the phone. Nice porn game. It's a dumb cut scene.
[814.95s -> 818.90s]  Oh, king of space. Oh, we're still going.
[822.98s -> 824.98s]  Oh, you got a gun. He has a gun.
[838.71s -> 843.51s]  Oh, that sounds like a stream scum. That did kind of sound like a stream scum.
[844.39s -> 848.79s]  I already did it. You guys don't know. What you guys don't know is I've lost this fight
[848.79s -> 854.31s]  35 times in a row, but you'll never know because I've just been stream scumming.
[854.95s -> 861.42s]  Remember that time that I beat all those Dark Souls bosses on the first try?
[861.42s -> 869.64s]  No, those were 200 and 300 attempts. But I have to make it believable. So I have to like lose
[869.64s -> 873.08s]  a bunch on some of them and then stream scum half of them. So then you think I'm like, okay.
[886.73s -> 898.84s]  There goes his head. That was Jevil. It landed right then. Gelter Helter.
[899.72s -> 907.42s]  Yeah, dead. Somebody gave a hundred bucks at the beginning of this. Like to address it.
[910.73s -> 922.34s]  Right after this cut scene. Oh, it's this lady again.
[946.28s -> 949.64s]  Does that quick a turn around on everything that's happened since the last game?
[949.96s -> 956.20s]  We're not going to be satisfied until you do, right? Oh, give me a break.
[956.20s -> 960.84s]  We're going to get a recap from the sequel who don't care about continuity. You know,
[962.52s -> 968.52s]  besides it would take forever if I recap every detail of your fall from greatness.
[968.52s -> 974.36s]  Players would skip it. It's so boring. Well, I guess you got a point there.
[974.36s -> 977.16s]  Yeah. Yeah. That's what I do.
[989.16s -> 990.52s]  What is a scam in the last game?
[1004.92s -> 1011.32s]  from rank 51 this time, more competition. The last game success made assassination
[1011.32s -> 1015.80s]  trendy. Yeah. But I already fought my way to number one before.
[1015.80s -> 1022.12s]  Shouldn't I get a special fast track to the title fight? No, but you will get a special prize.
[1023.40s -> 1031.06s]  Shut up. You can't bribe me this time. I've already trusted those goods,
[1031.06s -> 1034.90s]  but just a test. This time you'll get the five course meal.
[1036.47s -> 1047.21s]  Five course. Wait, I don't get what that means. Did you know I am a yoga? You don't say.
[1049.98s -> 1057.82s]  Are you familiar with any yoga positions? Like a down downward dog. The dog can do all sorts of
[1057.90s -> 1070.81s]  things. So Kenzie Cobra, the rabbit, Cobra, rabbit, rabbit. Hold on. Oh yeah. I'm in it to win baby.
[1070.81s -> 1086.31s]  Number one. Here I come. Hey, but he's still alive. I got a message for you. Oh my, he's still alive.
[1087.58s -> 1093.90s]  Pain in my ass. Why aren't you dead yet? Such blind arrogance like the naked emperor.
[1093.90s -> 1095.66s]  It was in connect.
[1123.90s -> 1132.34s]  I'd love for there to be another camera shot of the cameraman down here
[1132.34s -> 1134.98s]  during this just spinning around in circles with a fucking camera.
[1135.86s -> 1141.70s]  Now it's your turn to be burdened with another's death. It has destroyed me
[1142.50s -> 1147.14s]  and it will destroy you too. This is the ultimate vengeance.
[1152.25s -> 1175.83s]  That ruins the illusion. Yeah, it's supposed to. Porn and gore. Yeah, they like stab each other and
[1175.83s -> 1182.79s]  cut each other's faces. There's going to be some blood. There's no porn here though. That part
[1182.79s -> 1203.08s]  you're wrong. Help you find something. Yeah. We're the fucking super Mario cart. You never have
[1203.08s -> 1217.16s]  fucking copies of this shit. We're just here to collect Travis. Got like 20 Madden's, but only
[1217.16s -> 1240.30s]  four. You guys can do better than that. Madden Madden 96. What the fuck just happened? That was
[1240.30s -> 1247.02s]  always such a pain in the ass though. You'd go to a place like Blockbuster and they have the same
[1247.02s -> 1254.14s]  game that nobody wants. Taken up two full shelves and they're all in there. There's not one that's
[1254.14s -> 1257.98s]  taken. Not one's been rented out. And you're just like, well, come on, you can't, there's gotta be,
[1257.98s -> 1265.50s]  you can't give me more of these that are being actually rented. This is Scott Pilgrim game.
[1268.07s -> 1287.34s]  All right. Are you saying that because there's retro video game beep sounds. Hey, you can tell
[1287.34s -> 1293.00s]  when this is going out of style. Like right now, when you start seeing this shit in car commercials
[1294.58s -> 1299.70s]  and insurance commercials, how many times have you heard the like regular Nintendo sound?
[1302.20s -> 1304.68s]  That's how you can tell it. Oh, we, oh, we got it. This is going out of style.
[1306.41s -> 1314.26s]  Turbo tax. You guys, you never heard that before? You haven't seen that in,
[1323.08s -> 1330.09s]  I've, I've seen it. I haven't seen a commercial in years.
[1347.45s -> 1352.07s]  He gets a notification on his phone from Amazon. Your package has been delivered.
[1356.47s -> 1359.27s]  There's a photo to prove it. It's just your shattered fucking window.
[1393.43s -> 1394.63s]  I can't even pay attention to the story.
[1394.63s -> 1411.11s]  Swords ultraviolence to purge their souls of the hatred that blighted them.
[1416.31s -> 1422.23s]  A lot of cigarettes put out over there. See, she's got to smoke way more because the filters are too
[1422.23s -> 1432.92s]  big. I have set up the next, are you get his, just give me someone to fight. You sound passionate.
[1432.92s -> 1439.80s]  What's gotten into you subtitles on someone kill Bishop. I understand. I will, if I, you know,
[1445.75s -> 1452.28s]  you have a girlfriend, why are you playing this? Wait, you mean like, why, why am I streaming when
[1452.28s -> 1466.68s]  I have a girlfriend? What are you talking about? Do I have any shirts? I do. Okay. Let's get some
[1466.68s -> 1478.73s]  good clothes. I can't see it because of the jacket. I don't know what that, I was about to,
[1478.73s -> 1489.26s]  I don't know what that is. I want a different jacket and I have to buy it. This is the only
[1489.26s -> 1501.21s]  pants. Yep. Is the only everything. The volume up. Okay. There you go. You should be able to hear
[1501.21s -> 1514.65s]  sound. Perfect. That's way too loud. That was a, yeah. I put it back down where it was. Sorry,
[1514.65s -> 1527.69s]  one guy. Okay. Hold on. This is important. At a Reddit shelf over there. Or does that not count?
[1527.69s -> 1544.44s]  It doesn't count. This is a Reddit shelf. So what's the difference? This is what you would
[1544.44s -> 1561.66s]  consider. No, it's not. How am I saying no? It's the shelf. Jean's getting way too fat. Try to get
[1561.66s -> 1569.18s]  her to lose some weight. Making Jean go on a diet will put her in a foul mood. Dieting in a bad mood
[1569.18s -> 1575.34s]  will lower the effectiveness of the diet. Give her a snack from time to time. Jean doesn't like
[1575.34s -> 1579.82s]  doing the same things over and over. So once a menu has been selected, it won't be available for a
[1579.82s -> 1591.90s]  while. Okay. 24 pounds. All right. Let's do some jumps. Come on. 62 centimeters.
[1595.83s -> 1615.50s]  121 centimeters. Let's try again. 180. 240. One more. Yes. 300.
[1615.50s -> 1626.70s]  Jean. Yeah. That's got to do it. All right. Good. Now we give a treat. Stretch. All right.
[1626.70s -> 1643.13s]  Oh, no, no, no. Holy shit. This guy has a fucking walrus. Stop. You're killing it.
[1652.17s -> 1653.45s]  Those are just sound effects.
[1653.45s -> 1667.93s]  Okay. Now we need to feed. Here. Only the only premium food for my,
[1668.81s -> 1674.54s]  for my little darling. I don't have any money. Oh shit. I can't feed my cat.
[1683.48s -> 1697.26s]  Stop. Okay. Am I petting the cat or is the cat a bear against the tree with a really itchy
[1697.26s -> 1724.68s]  back? Much better mood. I feel like that you get fucking scratched. What is this?
[1725.48s -> 1734.15s]  What is this link? Oh my God. How did you get that? How did you do that?
[1734.79s -> 1753.08s]  How did you get it that quickly? Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. I'll show it in a second. Hold on.
[1753.08s -> 1762.65s]  Oh, nice. This isn't even from this stream. Oh, it's just the thing. Get it.
[1767.08s -> 1781.66s]  Yeah. Lost 0.3 pounds mood. It's all right. I don't, I can't. Okay. Let's get,
[1781.66s -> 1790.65s]  I need to get money for food. All right. First and foremost, we had 10,000 bits come in from
[1790.65s -> 1802.02s]  gimme $20. 100 bucks from gimme 20. Thanks for the 10,000 bits gimme $20. They say I rewatched
[1802.02s -> 1806.82s]  you through the ages stream and it still cracks me up. Please do another one soon. Watching you
[1806.82s -> 1811.30s]  cringe at your old content was hilarious. Also, the original Night of the Living Dead is public
[1811.30s -> 1816.34s]  domain. You need something for the next movie night. Yes, we will be watching that one.
[1817.70s -> 1823.30s]  Um, no, that was a ton of fun. Trust me when I say that this stuff like that pops up all the time.
[1825.67s -> 1831.26s]  And I just kind of have to jump on him if I want to do my right. I okay. That's not good.
[1833.08s -> 1839.67s]  God damn it. Viscera fucking cleanup detail. I just had a flashback. Uh, okay.
[1841.96s -> 1845.48s]  I just, I saw everybody saying spill joke, spill joke, spill joke, spill joke.
[1846.12s -> 1848.92s]  Just like there it is. It's right there. Okay. Let's see.
[1849.80s -> 1872.82s]  Spill joke. So funny. Spill joke. Let's do our first assignment on the subtitles.
[1872.82s -> 1880.42s]  Let's actually. Yeah. Subtitles on minimap on. Don't invert the camera.
[1882.62s -> 1893.96s]  Okay. More bits. Holy shit. More bits did come in. $50 from phylactery lich. Thanks for the 5,000
[1893.96s -> 1901.58s]  bits. What just happened to my game? Oh, okay. Okay. I was just, what the fuck is going on?
[1901.58s -> 1909.38s]  What just happened? Wait, why did this happen? Oh, cause the TV. Oh, okay. We're gonna start
[1909.54s -> 1914.90s]  bizarre Jerry and Joe. What is this? Like a, this is like the generic brand of medicine for Jojo's
[1914.90s -> 1928.07s]  bizarre adventure. It's our Jerry. Uh, uh, phylactery gave 5,000 bits. Remember the whole
[1928.07s -> 1931.83s]  point of this game is that Travis is a loser. Don't try and relate to him. It's embarrassing.
[1931.83s -> 1956.42s]  Nice porn game. Wait, what is, what the hell is, what am I playing? Wait, this is, I played this.
[1956.42s -> 1962.71s]  This is the other one. There it is. I don't have to play that. I don't have to do it anymore.
[1965.62s -> 1973.14s]  Everybody, the one person that's been begging me to play to Joe Joe. Now I don't ever have to do it
[1973.14s -> 1996.18s]  ever again. Yeah. Here it is. Right. He's lazy. Sure. Of course. Don't wait. Don't you let that
[1996.18s -> 2001.91s]  long to figure out that I need to do minimal effort for maximum gain. It's not even true.
[2009.40s -> 2022.33s]  Oh, maximum game. This one's locked. I'm not even looking.
[2028.07s -> 2032.79s]  Don't you have like bombs in these games? What's the button that I pressed that the screen fills
[2032.79s -> 2038.79s]  with a red circle and kills everything that hits the circle? Where's that button? It's in all of
[2038.79s -> 2068.23s]  these. Dude, you're losing viewers. Oh, fuck. What do I do? Fuck. Is this, I want to find a boss.
[2080.89s -> 2105.50s]  No, I'm alive. Holy shit. It's Miku. Who's Miku? Boss time. Let's go. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2105.50s -> 2147.91s]  I know what that is. I know what that is. I'm all right. It's a fucking game. It's a fucking
[2147.91s -> 2163.19s]  pretend game. Why do I care that much? All right. Just beat Toho on screen. Wait, what? I did AA.
[2166.71s -> 2172.49s]  Bizarre Jerry. That was fun. I'll probably never open that again.
[2173.72s -> 2187.78s]  Wait, got pure white love of Bizarre Jerry 5 video. What was that? Don't watch it. Don't wait. Why?
[2190.23s -> 2208.58s]  Are you serious? Are you serious? Should I turn it off? I don't know what this is. What do you mean?
[2208.58s -> 2218.39s]  I got one guide. It's not TOS. It's not TOS. People were saying TOS, dude. I'm like, what do
[2218.39s -> 2233.00s]  you want to do? Go. Oh, let's just watch it. Yo, TOS, dude. I want an apology every 20 minutes.
[2233.00s -> 2245.86s]  Oh, all right. I'll watch it later. Side job. It's horror time. Oh, God is now available.
[2248.04s -> 2253.64s]  Oh, I thought that was the side job. I was like, wow, that's okay. Lay the pipe is now available.
[2257.08s -> 2263.08s]  Oh, that's right. They got rid of the driving because everybody hated it so much in the first
[2263.08s -> 2285.21s]  game. Wow. I forgot you're going to go to burger soup. Am I strong enough to do this?
[2286.01s -> 2296.55s]  Now it has to get minus a letter grade. No, that's true. You're right. Is a shopkeeper Sylvia.
[2296.55s -> 2301.91s]  I want to make a deal. I'll conquer the rankings, fight whoever it takes. And in return,
[2302.79s -> 2311.50s]  you assholes who kill calm down. You shouldn't make this personal. It is the quickest way to
[2311.50s -> 2319.10s]  lose a battle. This isn't a battle anymore. It's a motherfucking war. Fine. It makes no difference.
[2320.62s -> 2325.18s]  The mastermind behind Bishop's death is the owner of pizza bed, this building,
[2326.06s -> 2330.14s]  most of the city. He is the head of the corporation that runs it all.
[2330.14s -> 2334.54s]  Listen, you see the whole jumping around from building to building. And as fate would have it,
[2334.54s -> 2338.78s]  he is also the number one assassin. You better not be lying.
[2339.50s -> 2347.50s]  It is a fact. The object of your game cube rendered wonderfully convenient. Don't you think?
[2348.14s -> 2355.74s]  Sure is. There's a new hotel on the beach. The 50th ranked assassin is waiting for you there.
[2356.46s -> 2362.46s]  By the way, that junior owns that hotel too. He really is everywhere, huh?
[2363.18s -> 2369.18s]  No, there are 50 other fighters trying to kill him. You have no time to waste.
[2369.18s -> 2371.82s]  Oh, we're definitely not going to have to fight 50 boss fights.
[2371.82s -> 2381.56s]  And what's the hell I'm going to raise. I kind of miss the guitar.
[2385.72s -> 2391.69s]  Taking advantage of people's sorrows. He used his music to lure followers.
[2391.77s -> 2399.19s]  He spoke of a grand faith, but his words were hollow. It was all to satisfy his own goal.
[2400.15s -> 2405.27s]  He'd only found success because of strong financial support from the new mafia
[2405.27s -> 2408.94s]  who used his pulpit to gain support for their own agenda.
[2409.90s -> 2414.54s]  Someone is a hundred times hornier than the last one. Jesus Christ.
[2414.54s -> 2419.02s]  But the real goal that drove him? That's a secret.
[2426.49s -> 2440.06s]  Camera's free. Get out of portrait mode, please.
[2440.06s -> 2451.29s]  Okay. This is ranking. Let's go to the side job one. There's nothing wrong with no more
[2451.29s -> 2461.38s]  heroes being horny. All right. Bug time. So pizza bats offering you the job of a lifetime
[2462.10s -> 2469.59s]  hardcore exterminator. Chicks love bug killers even more than doctors and pro athletes.
[2469.59s -> 2474.66s]  It's a little known fact. Terminate all the bugs in the stage within the time limit.
[2474.66s -> 2478.18s]  You can suck in blocks if you power up enough.
[2478.98s -> 2484.58s]  Giant enemy scorpions cannot be sucked unless you are at full power.
[2485.30s -> 2503.80s]  Oh, they did. They changed this too, right? Now I remember all the mini games are not actually.
[2505.29s -> 2511.54s]  Uh huh. Right. Okay. Here we go. So V is insecticide, A is suck in.
[2515.83s -> 2520.92s]  Let's go. Yeah. They made them all like regular Nintendo games.
[2526.26s -> 2534.28s]  It's more fun this way. I don't let you say that. And then I just got killed.
[2538.87s -> 2551.11s]  No more coconuts. Music's really, really good. This is really good. Can you suck up a mouse?
[2551.83s -> 2571.53s]  Oh, shit. Those are bugs. Those are mice. Come here. 800, 400, $4,800.
[2574.06s -> 2586.81s]  Mm hmm. You can't kill scorpions. Can I suck up these? You guys, you guys seen these devices
[2586.81s -> 2592.46s]  that'll like this? Where it's a little vacuum cleaner that you press onto the wall and suck
[2592.46s -> 2610.71s]  the bug up. It's like a tiny little sucker for spiders on your wall. Oh, wait, hold on.
[2611.75s -> 2618.26s]  That's insecticide. I don't need it yet. Oh, wait. No, you're talking about up here.
[2618.74s -> 2626.26s]  This is, this is papaya's theme. This is, this is bone works. What's this? It's the exact same song.
[2633.14s -> 2668.23s]  Holy shit. I wanted to hear it again. I mean, it was different. $11,300.
[2674.33s -> 2690.81s]  What? Oh man. What's this one too? This is another one.
[2700.74s -> 2718.02s]  What is it? I've heard this. Get them all quick. 21. Every single song is from Undertale.
[2718.58s -> 2735.00s]  Yeah, all music is Undertale. All games with soundtracks are Undertale.
[2735.56s -> 2756.76s]  E in that piss bucket up there. What are these tools? Is this extra money? I'm,
[2756.76s -> 2763.48s]  ooh. Whoa. Oh, these dolls are lobsters. I can't. What did I just do? That's a grenade.
[2764.28s -> 2775.46s]  Okay. Kill. Tuck it up. Tuck it up. Tuck it up. Oh, all right. Do it again. No,
[2775.46s -> 2778.34s]  shit. I didn't mean to do that. All right. This is, wait, this is a super grenade right here.
[2784.04s -> 2800.81s]  Wait, I can suck this up. Oh, you idiot. Get it? Okay. Now I need, uh, can I pick up another one?
[2802.17s -> 2812.39s]  It's more fun than the actual game. What does this battery do?
[2814.95s -> 2824.58s]  Oh, do I have full power? Does it matter anymore? Can I suck up scorpions? Oh yeah. That's right.
[2824.58s -> 2836.25s]  It's full power. Can I get him? He's huge. I can't get him. Just grenade him. What am I doing?
[2837.13s -> 2867.02s]  What am I doing? Why couldn't I get him? Grenade. Let's go. Okay. 1920. All right. Let's kill this
[2867.02s -> 2895.30s]  guy. Don't be mean. He's trying his best. I wasn't not even close. I mean, no, not even close. Dude,
[2895.30s -> 2899.22s]  am I making just a bunch of money? This is cool. Am I just making a ton of money? Why is it not
[2899.22s -> 2924.33s]  stopping me? Oh, can't suck those up. You made three dollars. Oh, come on. I tried to,
[2924.33s -> 2942.68s]  he just turned in a weird way. I died to a grasshopper. LOL. LOL. LOL. Thank you.
[2943.88s -> 2953.00s]  It's too many. Oh, fuck. Can I get him? What just happened? Am I poisoned? Why do I need the
[2953.00s -> 2975.03s]  antidote? What just killed me? Let's go. Oh, I lost. Okay. And how much money did I make?
[2975.83s -> 2992.02s]  How much money did I make? What do you mean zero? How do you make zero? What? Wait, because I,
[2994.81s -> 3005.37s]  you lost it all. Oh, so you have to retire before it's like, um, who wants to be a millionaire?
[3005.93s -> 3015.86s]  I get it. Okay. I do some plumbing. We'll pay you handsomely. Connect the exit to the entrance
[3015.86s -> 3019.70s]  using pipes within the time limit. Blue pipes can be moved, but not green pipes.
[3020.42s -> 3033.53s]  More pipes you connect, the more money you get. Here we go. Play the pipe. Lift, turn, move.
[3034.86s -> 3052.46s]  Easy. Let's go. Oh, nevermind. I don't, I hate these. Oh, I hate these. Where's it going?
[3053.66s -> 3060.94s]  Oh shit. It's go, I gotta get into the green pipe. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No. How am I
[3060.94s -> 3077.77s]  supposed to get this one? No, you go like this. How the fuck do I get out? Shit. No, get out of the
[3077.77s -> 3101.85s]  way. I need one of the, I need this. I need, get over here. Wait, wait, wait. No, it said, oh no,
[3101.85s -> 3107.61s]  listen. Listen, it said to connect the green ones and then it go up. I'm going to get more points,

[3116.02s -> 3121.26s]  wrong with his brain. No, his brain is fine. He's doing what he's supposed to be doing.
[3123.93s -> 3144.76s]  Oh my God. Oh my God. His brain. Guys, something wrong with his brain. Check this shit out. Oh,
[3144.76s -> 3158.47s]  yeah. Look at this shit. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Wait, what if I do something crazy?

[3182.38s -> 3196.74s]  Oh no, his brain. What's wrong with his mind? Check this shit out. Look at how many of these I'm
[3196.74s -> 3205.03s]  going to hit. And please fill it up. I hit so many greens. Everyone thought I was crazy.
[3208.20s -> 3231.83s]  And it's $700. Why is it taking taxes out? I went over on the left. Wait a minute. Yeah.
[3231.83s -> 3265.91s]  Yeah. This is fun. Yeah. Look at this cool, fun thing. Let's do, I need, I need clear time.
[3265.91s -> 3282.46s]  Is he having fun? Yeah, I'm having a ton of fun. Look at how fun this is. Okay. I'm just going to,
[3282.46s -> 3297.80s]  should I finish it or should I go for the, go for gold here? Okay. What if I do this? Should I just,
[3298.36s -> 3302.94s]  I go down and then around? Okay. I'm going to go like this. Okay. Right. That's what I'm going to do.
[3303.66s -> 3314.06s]  All right. I got it. Hold on. Move this. I got, God damn it. Hold on. He's got a Reddit brain.
[3315.10s -> 3319.53s]  I don't give a shit. I'm just having fun. All right. I got to move this stuff out of the way.
[3319.53s -> 3328.10s]  Cause I won't be able to get back over here. It's not blocking me in. I need these puzzles.
[3328.10s -> 3340.04s]  This is why you get this done first. All right. I need one of these. I'm going to go. God damn it.
[3340.04s -> 3351.62s]  I have to fuck. I need to get over here. Okay. Something was going on with his brain.
[3353.34s -> 3375.99s]  Uh, dude, check his brain. This is check his brain. I have enough. I have too many of these
[3376.55s -> 3397.91s]  straight ones. Fuck. Okay. Hold on. I can fix this, right? I can fix it. I can fix it. I can fix it.
[3399.51s -> 3405.16s]  I can fix it. I can fix it. I can fix it. I can fix it. Yeah. All right. Now go.
[3407.35s -> 3424.42s]  I got it. I got it. I got it. I fixed it. I got it. No, this is good. Hurry up. Oh, fuck. I have to,
[3424.42s -> 3430.39s]  I'm stuck in here. How do I do this? I need another set of hands. I need somebody else's hands.
[3430.39s -> 3433.35s]  Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I forgot. I can just take the wall down. Okay. Well, good,
[3433.35s -> 3454.38s]  good, good, good, good. Hey, look at that. I did it. I used every single piece. Fucking brain.
[3454.38s -> 3474.68s]  What about his brain? Is he okay? Let's get those tactics out. Here we go. Fast.
[3479.22s -> 3482.66s]  Put all the pieces in the right. And I'm doing peace management right now.
[3483.30s -> 3491.42s]  Oh, it's already here. It's already here. It's already there. It's already there. It's already
[3491.42s -> 3519.51s]  there. It's already there. And then, and then we got to go, uh, this, like this. Shit. Yes.
[3520.31s -> 3546.46s]  And like this way and then that way. And then check this out. Other way. It's too fucking late
[3546.46s -> 3561.21s]  now. It's too late. This is what I'm working with. And then we go like this. I, I, what are you
[3561.21s -> 3565.90s]  talking about? I fucked it. What are you talking about? How is it fucked? What are you talking
[3565.90s -> 3586.14s]  about? How? How is this fucked? How is this fucked up? It's fine. And this goes up all the
[3586.14s -> 3595.42s]  way through here. Yeah. How is this fucked up? Is this correct? I did it right. Oh,
[3595.42s -> 3616.15s]  oh, look at all these naysayers. Everybody said I blew it. That's actually the dumb one.
[3624.86s -> 3633.48s]  Okay. I think I call it here, right? That's $25,000. I'm done. If I lose, I lose it all.
[3633.56s -> 3655.88s]  Let's go to the gym. Oh yeah. I got to get the cat food and let's do our first training.
[3655.88s -> 3660.92s]  I haven't even played one mission yet and I'm just, it's just fun. Hey there, Mr. I can tell
[3660.92s -> 3664.36s]  it's your first time. Don't worry. We'll have fun breaking in. Just tell me what you want to focus
[3664.36s -> 3673.53s]  on. Uh, stamina. How much money do I have? 71, stamina. Yes. I'm ready. Stay in shape by using
[3673.53s -> 3684.33s]  the treadmill. Press the C and B button alternatively. Ready, set, go. Oh, this is cool.
[3685.53s -> 3705.58s]  What happened? I run off the treadmill. Turn it on, man. You don't say three, two, one, go. And
[3705.58s -> 3711.38s]  then tell me you're going to turn it on and just don't. I was of the opinion that I had to outrun
[3711.38s -> 3715.06s]  the treadmill thing because of how fast it was going to be going at cartoon speeds.
[3715.94s -> 3729.13s]  Can I just lose $2,000? I ran the wrong way. Wait, why am I facing this way? What are you talking
[3729.13s -> 3740.76s]  about? Oh, I didn't think you could change a treadmill's direction. I thought those things
[3740.76s -> 3767.77s]  in the bottom were just LEDs. Make it look cool, but faster. No, why? What? Somebody said what?
[3767.85s -> 3772.97s]  Where? Where brain stamina increased? Okay. What's that one?
[3781.85s -> 3789.26s]  Muscle. How fast can I tap the button? Up with the control stick. Let's do it.
[3790.30s -> 3804.74s]  Is there a jump? I would, I didn't look. How am I not ducking?
[3813.61s -> 3819.78s]  Wait, what? I didn't want to catch his kisses. Catching with my brain.
[3820.50s -> 3833.61s]  I got hit by a dumbbell. I thought I had to duck. Hey, near shoe, thanks for the $5,000.
[3836.92s -> 3853.45s]  Yeah, use your forehead to block the weights. Is this happy Gilmore? I get it now.
[3857.67s -> 3866.07s]  Party time. Oh, this dude has no fucking rhythm. Have you said, dude, you see this guy play
[3866.07s -> 3884.94s]  catapult? He's fucking socks at everything. It's gonna be real fun when I play the actual video.
[3884.94s -> 3902.87s]  Whoa. Attack power increased. Whatever that word is. All right, dude, hurry up and kill someone.
[3903.91s -> 3909.48s]  Not all about violence. God, some of you guys only care about the violence.
[3910.52s -> 3923.35s]  All right, we've done everything. Let's go back to the motel because I'm going to feed the cat.
[3923.35s -> 3927.75s]  Otherwise, this whole chat is going to revolt against me and I won't, I will not be able to
[3927.75s -> 3944.74s]  stream ever again because I didn't feed the cat. I feed premium quality cat food. Only the best.
[3953.24s -> 3968.01s]  She's happy. That's why the cat is fat, but we can maintain. We can maintain. All right, here we go.
[3968.65s -> 3980.39s]  Wait, there's so much to do right at the very beginning. Watch the fucking video. I will. I've
[3981.03s -> 3988.14s]  got to play the first mission of the game. It's been an hour. Travis effing touchdown. I've
[3988.14s -> 3994.12s]  been seeing you since my last door was closed. Take your time. All right, I want a new jacket.
[3994.12s -> 4006.38s]  I don't want to be default Travis touchdown. This is a different style. I don't want this one.
[4009.78s -> 4022.78s]  New old school. What about any different pants? I don't like these. What? Never mind.
[4024.15s -> 4037.13s]  Did you guys check on your desk? Well, I think it's stuck. Oh, hit the top of your city player.
[4037.13s -> 4050.39s]  Okay. That's just like, it was this one time when I was in college where there was somebody
[4052.23s -> 4057.03s]  in the dormitories, right? Everyone. We all shared space, right? It was,
[4057.03s -> 4061.35s]  it was a line of doors and we lived with somebody. Maybe you had a roommate, maybe you didn't. Maybe
[4061.35s -> 4068.87s]  you had a solo room, whatever. Um, but on my, on my area where I lived on campus,
[4070.55s -> 4077.03s]  one time this dude had it just, he left his room. He always listened to music very loudly
[4077.59s -> 4085.35s]  and he left his room one day and the door obviously locking his door and left his music on
[4085.35s -> 4091.51s]  like blaring really fucking loud. But the problem was the CD or something got stuck
[4092.31s -> 4102.17s]  so it was just going over and over for like fucking 30 straight minutes until like the building
[4102.17s -> 4107.45s]  manager had to come and like, and, and fucking open his door because he was gone for like four
[4107.45s -> 4110.97s]  hours at that point. And it was, everyone was just like, this is driving us fucking crazy.
[4115.85s -> 4126.62s]  Like the campus, like police had to like get involved. It was fucking insane. Where's the
[4126.62s -> 4139.10s]  video of that? I don't have a recording of this, but I just kept laughing my ass off.
[4139.90s -> 4144.46s]  Cause it, I mean, it was really fucking annoying, but at the same time, it's just, it was so funny
[4147.77s -> 4170.71s]  because it's like, what do you do? It's like a locked door. What the fuck are you doing, man?
[4172.39s -> 4178.84s]  Ooh, new music. Now I can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop thinking about me sitting there
[4178.84s -> 4191.48s]  and how funny I thought this was. C or two switch target. It's kind of hard to do that.
[4198.76s -> 4204.60s]  You fucking asshole. I missed it. Tiger on the bottom right of the screen is the ecstasy gauge.
[4205.48s -> 4209.88s]  The gauge will increase each time you attack an enemy. The gauge will decrease each time you get
[4209.88s -> 4217.08s]  hit. When your gauge goes up and the tiger turns red and connect your slash combos longer
[4218.44s -> 4225.13s]  and activate the high speed slash attack mode by pressing the minus. Okay.
[4237.80s -> 4252.98s]  Here's the boys looking for blood. You still here? You get what you're looking for? His
[4252.98s -> 4267.14s]  head exploded. He fucking exploded. Yeah, I know. It's pog, huh? Am I just holding the button wrong?
[4268.42s -> 4283.05s]  Oh, you're right. You can turn into the tiger. Holy shit. I forgot about this. Kill everyone.
[4286.84s -> 4303.90s]  Oh, letter grade. This is not a car. It's basically a car. Well, I mean, it kind of
[4304.94s -> 4324.44s]  is the gauge increased. Money. I like this song too. All right, let's go.
[4331.10s -> 4335.02s]  It's the title theme. All right. I have a superpower.
[4349.96s -> 4363.46s]  Oh, it's you. Okay. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Stop. I'm blocking the stuff looking.
[4384.76s -> 4393.82s]  They even say that in this game. They have to, right? There's no way they don't. Got a guitar?
[4410.36s -> 4434.49s]  Okay. Yes. His voice is so good. He has a fantastic screaming voice. This is so much behind him.
[4449.61s -> 4463.94s]  I carved that fucking guy up. Battery. Wait. Oh, come on. Really?
[4463.94s -> 4485.10s]  Okay. I don't think they're here right now. Of course they are. They're always here.
[4496.63s -> 4503.96s]  Oh, too bad they didn't do it three times. Oh, yes. I love it when you hit more than two or three.
[4510.63s -> 4522.60s]  Get him. Yeah, it's the medic. It is the medic's voice actor. Robin Atkin Downs.
[4523.56s -> 4527.48s]  The name of the actor. Very talented. Very, very, very good at what they do.
[4541.19s -> 4552.30s]  Why are we here? Come on. I need three in a row. I'm not satisfied without three.
[4552.30s -> 4559.85s]  Nice.
[4576.14s -> 4581.05s]  It really is too bad. There's no more. Are you prepared?
[4595.48s -> 4608.57s]  Battery card. You're a pain.
[4608.57s -> 4626.36s]  You're all very on the shortcake. Here comes another one. You? You're still alive?
[4627.40s -> 4640.18s]  There's more than one enemy type in this one. Yeah, there is. All right. Anything else?
[4641.54s -> 4654.78s]  It's over here. No. I thought I just missed something. Okay. Let's go.
[4655.74s -> 4668.84s]  Am I going to scream Minecraft today? You know, I was thinking about it. I came to the determination
[4668.84s -> 4675.88s]  that I don't think so. No. I was thinking about it, though. A few hours ago, I was like, yeah,
[4675.88s -> 4687.75s]  that's probably... No. I was like, Travis Touchdown. I won't let him lie to you. I won't let him lie to
[4687.75s -> 4709.42s]  you. This must be karma. Travis Touchdown. Spare me the mystic crap. I came here to fight.
[4711.90s -> 4733.94s]  What the fuck? Oh my God. I see the rumors were true. I don't know who's talking about me,
[4734.74s -> 4740.58s]  but that nickname's all right. Listen to me, your highness. These rankings mean nothing to me.
[4741.54s -> 4746.74s]  Neither does my sect or the mom. My only true calling was to clash swords with you.
[4747.54s -> 4754.18s]  That's why I joined this contest. I was starving for a worthy fool. Then you're in luck,
[4754.90s -> 4759.54s]  because I'm as worthy as it gets, and I've got a shit ton of anger to work out.
[4759.54s -> 4766.82s]  That's what I like to hear. This is it. This is what I've been praying for. I'm weary of this
[4766.82s -> 4776.42s]  guilty world. Oh, glitter. No soul. Save me from sorrow, crownless king. Thy sword and thy wrath
[4776.42s -> 4783.38s]  will deliver me. You should go easy on that crazy punch. How about I just cut you a new one?
[4784.50s -> 4790.34s]  We'll both do as divinity commands. Here we go. First boss. Hallelujah. Here we go.
[4790.98s -> 4813.05s]  Oh, I have no more battery. Battery. What are you doing? What the hell was that? Battery.
[4816.17s -> 4820.31s]  It takes so much longer in this one.
[4820.31s -> 4847.78s]  Good. It's two. Oh, fuck. All right, hold on. Back up. Shit's out of battery already again.
[4851.18s -> 4873.85s]  Run. The world is being destroyed. It don't matter. Oh, it's dead again. I'm trying to.
[4876.97s -> 4878.01s]  What the hell are you doing?
[4878.01s -> 4891.03s]  Get it. Get the fuck in there. Oh, shit.
[4902.31s -> 4910.25s]  Like this rock is with an air blast.
[4910.25s -> 4951.02s]  Damn it. Okay. All right, here we go. Let's go. Let's go. Chandelier. Chandelier's down.
[4951.02s -> 4984.34s]  All right, don't get hit. H3.
[4984.90s -> 5003.10s]  Oh, no, no.
[5006.82s -> 5016.73s]  Break it. I can't break these fucking huge. Battery.
[5020.26s -> 5042.71s]  Extra crank. Shit's dead. To keep blessing himself. I can't.
[5042.71s -> 5061.80s]  Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. Let's go.
[5066.84s -> 5078.10s]  Oh, don't do that. Watch out for the laser. Don't get hit by a laser. Oh, dear. He's got more shit.
[5078.10s -> 5114.20s]  Shit. He's camping. Oh, you dick. What the fuck? He just hit manned me. He just did a hit man trap.
[5114.20s -> 5131.74s]  How did I fall for that? Don't block it. Nobody ever uses the chandelier move and hit man because
[5131.74s -> 5161.16s]  it's so obvious. I'm the one that fell for it. This battery sucks. Damn it. I'm gonna die.
[5163.00s -> 5191.03s]  Yeah, I agree. Oh, my God. I can't even move. Dude. Shit. Done. Fuck. Oh, no. He's got a plant.
[5206.46s -> 5217.69s]  I don't want to do this. I don't want to have an explode on me. This is fucking horrible.
[5217.69s -> 5235.03s]  Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Get him and grab him. Grab him. Why did I fucking grab him? No. No.
[5240.92s -> 5259.83s]  Die. Just die. I win. That was all over the place. Oh, my God. He beat the first boss.
[5261.27s -> 5281.22s]  Do you want a cookie? How many scums was that? You'll never know. Captain Nemo,
[5281.22s -> 5291.98s]  thanks for the 5,000 bits. $50. I just got a big ass unemployment check. So I figured
[5291.98s -> 5300.10s]  I'd stimulate the economy. Go get yourself some McChickens. It's a lot of money.
[5302.50s -> 5308.90s]  When are you gonna do Rat Movie 3? I don't know. Tomorrow? Never? Somewhere between there.
[5315.70s -> 5343.34s]  I can't fucking wait. The job's in the... Rat Movie 3 date confirmed. You heard it here first,
[5343.34s -> 5350.78s]  guys. Spread the news. Yeah, it'll be somewhere between tomorrow and the day that I die.
[5352.95s -> 5377.06s]  Hopefully somewhere in the low hundreds. I'm really shooting for 110 to 120. You're not
[5377.06s -> 5395.26s]  gonna make it to 80, man. Who am I killing? I afforded the directions to your map. I'm busy,
[5395.26s -> 5419.43s]  so hurry up. Gotcha. Okay. It happened again. Spill joke. What's on the shelf?
[5423.43s -> 5431.11s]  Another $50 just came in. Watch the anime. I got a backlog of animes to watch. I'll watch it
[5431.11s -> 5443.03s]  eventually. A one true roadie thanks to the $50. I haven't been able to catch many streams lately
[5443.03s -> 5450.44s]  due to landing my dream job. I'm a full-time mechanic. That's fucking awesome. Thanks to the
[5450.44s -> 5454.52s]  near decade of laughs and many more to come. If you ever play Monster Hunter World with the
[5454.52s -> 5463.00s]  Iceborn expansion, that's something I'd love to see. I probably won't. I haven't played any Iceborn.
[5463.88s -> 5471.14s]  I haven't played any Monster Hunter World for at least seven or eight months. It's a great game.
[5471.14s -> 5475.70s]  I beat it. I completed it. I went through the next couple little small things after the final
[5475.70s -> 5482.04s]  and that's not all right. That's what the cat was seeing when it was being shook back and forth.
[5486.12s -> 5490.04s]  No, thanks for the huge money. Just lots of back-to-back-to-back money right now.
[5492.07s -> 5498.70s]  I spoiled a bucket. I'm just sorting algorithm awful sound effects.
[5499.42s -> 5516.89s]  Oh, no. Coconut grabber. Oh, wait. Pizza. Wait. Oh, pizza. Wait. Hold on. I got to feed the cat.
[5521.75s -> 5541.69s]  Okay. How many? I got ones in chat. If you prefer a plain cheese pizza. Okay. Let's play.
[5543.77s -> 5551.21s]  At least pepperoni. Yep. Yep. Come here. Okay. How many of you guys
[5551.93s -> 5556.58s]  um enjoy like for instance like a margarita pizza?
[5557.46s -> 5560.90s]  It's the only difference. A margarita pizza really is just like a cheese pizza
[5561.93s -> 5567.66s]  with a little bit of basil on it. Come here. I like it. I think it's good.
[5571.78s -> 5579.18s]  That's tomato. Yeah, so does every pizza has tomato. This is not squished up.
[5579.82s -> 5588.01s]  All right. Let's do some scratches.
[5588.01s -> 5595.06s]  What a lobster pizza.
[5601.69s -> 5608.09s]  Not all pizza has tomato sauce as a base. Yeah, but if you order a hundred pizzas,
[5608.09s -> 5613.77s]  90 of them are going to have red tomato sauce on it. Sometimes, you know, you get a white pizza
[5613.77s -> 5620.73s]  or pesto sauce or most people put pizza sauce on their pizza. Is this something we actually
[5620.73s -> 5629.61s]  have to argue that a majority of pizzas sold on earth have tomato sauce on them? You guys
[5629.61s -> 5642.39s]  realize that like most people like order pizza from Domino's more than and I'm on a rant. This
[5642.39s -> 5649.83s]  is no, there's no rant. It's not like a 30% of people put tomato sauce on their pizza. It's like
[5649.83s -> 5666.50s]  close to a hundred. Okay. Get it. Yeah. Guys, don't talk about pizza. That means he ends the stream.
[5667.46s -> 5671.30s]  Oh shit. You're right. Stop doing that. Yeah.
[5674.25s -> 5701.72s]  That's got to do it. 21 pounds. All right. Bad mood though. A good massage. And this is all
[5709.75s -> 5717.22s]  20. I got a 20, 21. All right. Now we're going to feed you the most high quality food.
[5718.10s -> 5744.86s]  Premium. Only premium for my cat. She's not breathing anymore. Stop stacking them. Why are
[5744.86s -> 5763.80s]  you stacking four or five of them? What the fuck are you doing? Anime. Watch the anime. No, Netflix
[5763.80s -> 5769.00s]  has ruined me. I'm not waiting a week for an episode ever again for any TV show that's ever
[5769.00s -> 5774.57s]  been released from here going out. I can't, I'm not doing that anymore. The whole thing's just there.
[5775.53s -> 5785.29s]  I want to be able to watch an entire series run in three days. I'm not watching one episode
[5785.29s -> 5792.60s]  and then waiting like three hours. Oh, we have to go here. This is where the sword upgrades are.
[5792.60s -> 5808.71s]  Yo, Joe is on Netflix. Yo, I don't want to, I don't want to watch that right now. Oh, it's you.
[5809.27s -> 5824.26s]  I'm not finished with that new toy you asked for, but 50,000 for Amelia and a three. Let's go much
[5824.26s -> 5829.35s]  cuter when you have money. Wait, press two during battle, switch to a different weapon.
[5831.74s -> 5848.25s]  All right. Let's see if I can level up. I got new side jobs too.
[5848.81s -> 5870.76s]  Now let's go to the gym. What about desert pizzas? Um, that's a pie. All right. Stamina again.
[5870.76s -> 5884.44s]  Desert feeds. Yeah. I said that weird dessert. I did say that kind of weird
[5895.05s -> 5895.53s]  desert.
[5899.21s -> 5907.85s]  Well, it's changing on me. He's changing on me real quick. This makes me really,
[5907.85s -> 5912.62s]  really excited for the third game. I hope it's just as weird and interesting.
[5912.70s -> 5931.74s]  Let's pull things to do. It's the funniest movie of the year. Same. What do you mean same?
[5937.37s -> 5947.19s]  Okay. Muscle 4,000. Same. Why I guess it's same. Same. Same. Oh my God. True.
[5948.31s -> 5950.95s]  All right. Yeah, I guess you're right. Yeah, I guess so.
[5950.95s -> 5991.53s]  Oh, those are hard. Ah, did I pass? I didn't pass. I hate that. I hate those. It's hard to
[5993.29s -> 6007.91s]  damn it. Damn it. You excited for the next game? Oh, hell yeah. I wonder just how
[6009.56s -> 6013.50s]  not good, in quotes, the one that came out on PC was.
[6019.45s -> 6023.61s]  Wasn't the thing with the one on PC was it was not that great. It was still okay.
[6025.13s -> 6042.09s]  I fucking blew it again. I can take one hit, right? It's good. There we go. Yeah, you can hit once.
[6044.78s -> 6055.08s]  Okay, but it's not the same. TSA is more about the lore. TSA was a vent post by Suda.
[6057.02s -> 6069.22s]  Wait, what do you mean? A vent post? It actually was. All right, new side job. Coconut grabber.
[6069.22s -> 6080.30s]  It was a shit post. In the city have forgotten our rich heritage. They're not collecting coconuts.
[6080.30s -> 6085.10s]  It's a disaster. Tradition says you're not a real man until you've grabbed your first big fuzzy
[6085.10s -> 6091.18s]  coconut. You got to be a role model for these kids. They'll do it, right? Kick the coconut
[6091.18s -> 6096.62s]  trees to make the coconuts fall. Gather as many coconuts as you can. Carry them to the goal
[6096.62s -> 6121.02s]  within the time limit. Okay. Coconut grabber. Kick. Move. Dash. Kick. My head. How do I pick
[6121.02s -> 6129.19s]  them up? Oh, I get it. What the fuck? It was in there. How did you do that to yourself?
[6138.22s -> 6158.95s]  Fuck. Oh, it's bad. Oh, I got them both. Oh, it's the song. That's gone. I did it.
[6158.95s -> 6180.04s]  It's the Mario stuff. Of course it's fucking... I'm just a scarecrow. Can you kick them?
[6186.15s -> 6219.32s]  Oh my god. I didn't get one. Shit. You can't kick the scorpion. Hey, watch it. Fuck. I'm not very
[6219.32s -> 6281.43s]  good at this one. I have to go like this. Oh, all right. Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.
[6283.66s -> 6310.82s]  Oh, bounce. On the bounce. On the bounce. Fuck. It didn't go in. Oh. Okay. I'm good. This is fun.
[6311.38s -> 6352.33s]  Come on. Shit. Shit. Okay. I'm done. This one's fun. One more.
[6352.33s -> 6382.74s]  Mario. What the hell would I do that for? This reminds me of Super Frog. I was going to say
[6382.74s -> 6392.58s]  Super Mario. You know what's a bad thing when I hear the word super and I want to say Mario?
[6392.58s -> 6403.26s]  I don't think of Mario. I think of Super Frog. Come on. Get it. Why?
[6403.98s -> 6412.49s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh. No.
[6428.90s -> 6451.50s]  Hey, hey. I could have just fucking got it. Wait, wait, wait. Nice. We need a Super Frog emote.
[6451.50s -> 6469.78s]  There already is one. The BT Better Twitch TV. Cool. Nice work. Oh, Super Frog. Thank you,
[6469.78s -> 6481.77s]  Super Bruce for the 530 subs. Super Frog. Is this a cooking one?
[6508.06s -> 6516.06s]  That's another fun one to do. Break. Change gear. Steer. Break. Change gear.
[6517.02s -> 6536.94s]  I can do nitro. What do you do? Is this pizzas? All right. High gear. I don't know why I thought
[6536.94s -> 6541.26s]  there was a hamburger on the road. Did I pick up? I thought that was a hamburger on the road. It
[6541.26s -> 6552.98s]  was very small. That's not food or anything. That's a rock, right? Okay. See? I told you.
[6552.98s -> 6562.92s]  There's stuff on the road. They look friendly and just get real close. God damn it. That's not a
[6562.92s -> 6588.25s]  car, right? Those are cars. What the fuck? What is this? The Nintendo. Duh. Oh, letter grade.
[6588.25s -> 6598.92s]  Yeah, of course. They don't give you very much leeway there. I can do better than that.
[6598.92s -> 6610.82s]  Dude, what was that game? I want to play that game. That Super Nintendo game with,
[6612.42s -> 6617.43s]  it's like when Montana Max is a Tiny Toons game. We have to spam A and cut down trees and it's
[6617.43s -> 6626.31s]  like the Olympics. Did I play that on stream? I haven't played that on stream, have I? Oh,
[6626.31s -> 6631.02s]  this is one of my favorite games. That's my favorite game ever. It's the Tiny Toons Olympic
[6631.02s -> 6637.96s]  Games game. The Tiny Toons and the games. Somebody will know what I'm talking about.
[6655.48s -> 6674.54s]  These oil slicks. Oh, hands on the wheel. Hands on the wheel. Too fast. Too fast. Too fast.
[6675.50s -> 6688.89s]  50. Thanks Chunky Baloney for the $50. High gear. I'm pretty sure that was me who left the music on,
[6688.89s -> 6694.01s]  but I was pissed at one of our suitemates, so I did it on purpose. However, I didn't know the CD
[6694.01s -> 6704.52s]  would skip. It was just supposed to be for like 30 minutes, not four hours. Hey, my bad.
[6714.36s -> 6728.01s]  That's so funny. Oh, it's CD guy. That's so fucking funny. The stage just got bigger,
[6728.01s -> 6735.26s]  but thanks for the $50, dude. You don't have to do that. You guys pay me huge fucking money.
[6735.26s -> 6748.47s]  You want me to get run over by cars? Go, go, go, go, go. How the fuck did I miss that?
[6749.03s -> 6762.07s]  Dude, this stage is going to spin horizontal. It's going to be stage five of Teenage Mutant
[6762.07s -> 6785.30s]  Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time. What comes first? Fucking Mack truck. It's hard to determine when
[6785.30s -> 6806.28s]  the toads evolve into cars in front of screens. Ah, too fast. Why are they all going the same
[6806.28s -> 6812.22s]  direction? I don't know, but I can't wait to spam. I'm playing that like very soon.
[6814.09s -> 6821.56s]  Tiny Toons. Outdoor games. That game was hard as shit. It was insanely difficult.
[6821.56s -> 6832.62s]  Yeah, wacky sports challenge. You got it. That's the one. Cancel the green screen for Tiny Toons.
[6834.28s -> 6861.93s]  What do you think I am? The car is going the wrong way.
[6862.41s -> 6880.84s]  I just got hit twice. Am I the one going the wrong way? No, I'm not. There's a middle divider.
[6880.84s -> 6900.04s]  You're the yellow line. They are going the wrong way. What? That was actually shocking to me.
[6900.68s -> 6916.58s]  Shocking. I'm trying to rip the fucking wheel, man. I got 30 seconds to get the hell out of here.
[6917.30s -> 6935.02s]  All right. No more bullshit. Go. No more horse shit. There was no control. I had no control.
[6935.02s -> 6942.82s]  I'm not going to do it. Wait, is it straight away? Hit it. Get it, please.
[6947.94s -> 6956.73s]  No, don't reply. I wanted to get out. I didn't want to reach. It's high.
[6956.73s -> 6970.87s]  You have enough driver's license? Yes, I do. All right. Motel. Save game.
[6971.91s -> 6984.04s]  Then play Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2003. No, I don't like the cartoon games.
[6989.70s -> 6996.18s]  No, I don't like when the game is based on the cartoon. I like for the game to be just the game.
[6998.30s -> 7016.41s]  Sorry. Tiny toots. No, what I'm saying is the TMNT game, the new ones are tie-ins with Nickelodeon.
[7017.05s -> 7030.44s]  It's not like, oh, Konami just made a Ninja Turtles game. How is that wrong? Is that wrong?
[7034.97s -> 7050.15s]  Are you dumb? No, because that's based on the cartoon. What do you mean so?
[7051.11s -> 7057.67s]  Okay, I'll give you a hand here. Hulk Ultimate Destruction versus Hulk the Video Game for Wii.
[7058.98s -> 7062.74s]  Somebody just made a Hulk game because they wanted to. They didn't base it on a cartoon character.
[7062.74s -> 7065.78s]  They didn't base it on a currently running cartoon TV show.
[7080.58s -> 7086.82s]  Groupies? What's that supposed to mean? Thanks. If I told you now, I'd ruin the surprise.
[7087.54s -> 7093.30s]  Go see for yourself. Fine. Whoever they are, I'll make sure they get a nice close-up of my bean katana.
[7094.50s -> 7098.42s]  All you feel is ecstasy when you kill. New clothes after this. It's like you're getting off.
[7099.38s -> 7104.42s]  Seriously, you need help. Everybody deals with grief differently, right?
[7104.98s -> 7108.10s]  Some people fuck at funerals. I cut off heads.
[7111.06s -> 7116.34s]  Do what you must, Travis. What the hell?
[7119.80s -> 7131.85s]  Who does that? All right. So, who do I have? Let's go get some new clothes.
[7138.68s -> 7146.60s]  You do, psycho screamer. Do you mind something yet? I hope so.
[7153.24s -> 7156.92s]  Oh, I don't like this. This is the only one that's different, though.
[7157.56s -> 7172.78s]  It's $30,000 or whatever. Don't need this. No, I don't like this one.
[7173.42s -> 7177.10s]  It feels like I'm too fat for this jacket. It feels like the zipper won't go up anymore.
[7179.77s -> 7197.32s]  Blue shirt? Can I just take the jacket off and be in a graphic tee? Ice cream. Yeah, I want the ice
[7197.32s -> 7213.94s]  cream. I'll take it. At least give me new pants. All right. At least there. All right. The screaming
[7213.94s -> 7233.30s]  in the background is kind of getting to me here. This is Haunted House CD track 12. Rio-Bate?
[7233.94s -> 7243.70s]  15 community subs. Thank you, Rio-Bate. Appreciate it. That's 15 subs. Just dropped right fucking
[7243.70s -> 7260.82s]  like. I don't even like this belt. Why did I just get it? I'll take it. I just spent all my money
[7260.82s -> 7274.52s]  on stuff that I don't even want. Sing along? Sure. Oh, the Simpsons are riot. Simpsons are riot.
[7280.01s -> 7298.71s]  Simpsons. Where's the next Simpsons game? Time for a ranking battle. That's it. The Simpsons game
[7298.71s -> 7312.42s]  sucks. What are you, a dick? I got a new weapon. Oh, hold on. We've got a link. Oh, no, no, no.
[7312.42s -> 7325.14s]  Super frog. We got, this guy plays Tiny Toons Adventures. All right. Why do they even need to
[7325.14s -> 7339.32s]  click on this? I kind of want that shirt now. I kind of want this. All right. I got a new weapon,
[7339.32s -> 7348.02s]  right? There it is. Let's see it. Oh, it's like from the last game.
[7363.93s -> 7378.38s]  Who the fuck is this guy? Wait, this is just like a worker. Who was that? Wait, it's like a
[7385.40s -> 7391.85s]  Reborn. Yeah, that guy was making a delivery.
[7392.65s -> 7399.13s]  That was like a, it was like a pizza delivery. I mean, why would you get out of the car?
[7403.42s -> 7406.62s]  This looks like a place where I could, here, I'd want to be right now.
[7413.83s -> 7426.70s]  Out of limo? I don't know. See, special delivery. Anything else? Could be a secret.
[7427.83s -> 7433.43s]  All right. I can do the super slash in a second here. I haven't done enough.
[7448.66s -> 7458.94s]  I've been PVPing for fucking decades, kid. Hey, you and your buddy. What, you just new installs?
[7472.39s -> 7473.67s]  This guy's still talking.
[7473.75s -> 7492.86s]  Oh, he got me. Jesus. What the fuck? I agree.
[7500.18s -> 7506.98s]  All right. Take his ass. It doesn't do any damage. Secret.
[7507.70s -> 7529.26s]  Oh, not again. You want to roll? Where's the music? Where is the music?
[7530.46s -> 7539.10s]  It does feel weird without the, yeah, this is weird. Oh, I'm done. I'll see you tomorrow.
[7543.35s -> 7559.64s]  Hey, came killer collection number 52 and some money. You're the music.
[7572.01s -> 7584.10s]  He just smashed his head. This guy can't even do anything.
[7588.73s -> 7591.69s]  I queued it up. I was going back and forth about to do it.
[7595.93s -> 7601.37s]  Another thing I've done like a thousand times. An anonymous gifter has gifted 10
[7602.65s -> 7608.36s]  immunity subs. Thanks for the 10 subs, anonymous, whoever you are. Thank you.
[7609.24s -> 7612.52s]  I really appreciate it. Shitload of subs.
[7615.62s -> 7619.03s]  It's the 10 fucking subs. Cool.
[7633.53s -> 7641.08s]  Can't resist.
[7642.04s -> 7666.76s]  Oh, sorry. Cool. Chris. Better do it right. Battery juice. Cold cheese. That's fine.
[7666.76s -> 7680.55s]  It'll heat up on the burger. He's a celebrity of sorts. Even I caught myself checking him out.
[7681.35s -> 7687.67s]  Just looking into his eyes. Just fold the piece of cheese up once or twice. Put it in your mouth.
[7687.67s -> 7693.67s]  Close your mouth. Your body temperature. Your mouth is like a hundred degrees. Heat it up in
[7693.67s -> 7697.03s]  there for like 30 seconds at a hundred degrees Fahrenheit in your mouth oven.
[7697.03s -> 7712.70s]  And then just like, just lay it on the fucking patty. What the fuck? What?
[7712.70s -> 7720.81s]  Oh, my God.
[7723.29s -> 7736.07s]  Is that weird? Does that make me weird? You guys think I'm weird? No, I'm not. I am. Yeah,
[7736.07s -> 7752.84s]  I'm kind of a weird guy. Yeah. You guys think that? Yeah, I guess so. No, he said normie.
[7754.12s -> 7758.78s]  No, no, no. Don't let him have that. He said normie.
[7758.78s -> 7788.42s]  Okay. What am I? Am I a reverse Superman? Because is my Clark Kent me pretending to be
[7788.42s -> 7801.21s]  normal in front of my parents? You guys get to see Superman? Okay, mother, it's time for me to go.
[7801.21s -> 7808.49s]  I have some work to do. Oh, work. Yup, that's me. Oh, my little boy's working. Yeah, I gotta go to
[7808.49s -> 7816.10s]  work. Oh, can't wait. What do you do for work, honey? Yeah, I'm an accountant. And then skip to
[7816.10s -> 7821.56s]  me and put it on my fucking twitch shirt. The phone booth or something. I get out and I'm like,
[7821.56s -> 7832.36s]  look at me. Something like farting and screaming sounds. I can put like, putting cheese in my mouth
[7832.36s -> 7836.20s]  and heating it up with my oven in my mouth. I wouldn't tell that to my mother. She'd be like,
[7836.20s -> 7845.64s]  what's happening to you? Able to make himself sound like a fucking psycho in a single moment.
[7846.36s -> 7867.67s]  It's able to complete John's hope in three settings on stream. It's a chair. It's a statue.
[7868.39s -> 7897.34s]  No, it's a live streamer. There's another chest in there. McDonald's. Oh, my God. Wait,
[7897.34s -> 7906.49s]  you're the streamer? Yup, that's me. I'm talking about my secret identity, which is just me with
[7906.49s -> 7933.85s]  glasses on. Apparently people are this dumb. Well, they are. Cool, crisp, LT. X cameras.
[7934.41s -> 7939.29s]  We just got to see it. You saw it happen. That's why I don't like fixed cameras
[7940.01s -> 7949.40s]  in Resident Evil video games. Play ads now. That's not what you've been listening to for the last
[7949.40s -> 7953.99s]  two or three straight minutes. The last like 10 minutes has been an ad for McDonald's. What
[7953.99s -> 7971.14s]  are you talking about? Oh, don't start fucking counting. The mature filter on. Yeah, just keep
[7971.14s -> 8006.92s]  it on with the helmet on. Mr. Touchdown. It's an honor to face you. Man, I love your name.
[8006.92s -> 8012.44s]  You got to fight me with all your hoes. That's my game. But we need a better arena. Don't you
[8012.44s -> 8029.90s]  think? Huh? Let's go, ladies. Santa. God. Ha ha ha dot dot dot. Oh, God.
[8044.84s -> 8051.00s]  Time to bust out the toy Naomi made. Rocket ship. His long awaited debut.
[8051.88s -> 8063.58s]  Glass and Barry. Let's pop. I don't remember this at all.
[8064.38s -> 8084.73s]  Gotcha Force 2. Yeah, we get to play Gotcha Force. What? A is slash. B is jump. Z is guard.
[8084.73s -> 8092.15s]  Press A or B while jumping to jump attack. I see when the X is full and he's just special move.
[8092.15s -> 8139.90s]  All right. All right. All right. You can jump over it. No, jump. See, I saw the background.
[8139.90s -> 8174.12s]  I thought I had to do a pipe for him again. No, jump over it. No. Why wouldn't you fight
[8174.12s -> 8189.10s]  everybody in this suit? That's a good question. Close, right? Wait, he said it twice. You hear
[8189.10s -> 8215.62s]  that? Oh, fuck. Jump. He's so slow. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. He's dead. He's slow to move.
[8229.93s -> 8234.89s]  Look at the shrug. Just told his hard enough. He squishes ahead. Explode.
[8248.42s -> 8259.30s]  A, B, C, Z. I'll hit them all at the same time. That was just like the skip thing. Fucked it all.
[8259.30s -> 8263.54s]  That was like when in the middle of an insanely important part of the story, the thing on the
[8263.54s -> 8270.10s]  bottom right pops up and it's like Peter Griffin and Lois. It's like Family Guy. I'm PM on TBS.
[8271.30s -> 8287.61s]  I don't fucking ever want to see that again. I should make some of those.
[8287.77s -> 8295.61s]  Dirties my style. Just have them pop up randomly. Just made up shows and shit that I do.
[8307.53s -> 8311.94s]  Yeah, I'm going to do it. We'll get some made from the green screen incoming.
[8324.62s -> 8328.14s]  I'll do some like point of the camera. Walk into frame. Look around. Look at the bottom.
[8328.14s -> 8332.86s]  Point at the title of the fucking game or something. And like, yeah, look at that. Thumbs up.
[8333.58s -> 8334.62s]  Then like walk back off.
[8341.26s -> 8367.82s]  Charlie McDonald? Travis Touchdown. How do you pick your nose with gloves on?
[8372.57s -> 8377.51s]  That's kind of disgusting. Well, you take your glove off, you pick your nose,
[8377.51s -> 8401.18s]  and then you put your glove back on. Fingerless gloves. Skippable optional boss coming. Do it.
[8402.14s -> 8413.42s]  Okay. Ice Queen? What's with the harsh treatment?
[8414.30s -> 8428.98s]  Anime time. We will. I like her better when she's horny.
[8434.39s -> 8462.22s]  ES2 feet. You guys are fucking crazy. Hands and feet in all old games were just like Lego blocks.
[8462.22s -> 8470.60s]  That's all they were. Like all feet in all games before like, like 2007.
[8471.40s -> 8493.05s]  It was all like dinosaur feet. And then like mittens for hands. No, I want new. I want to
[8493.05s -> 8503.98s]  jacket. Watch the anime. I'm not watching anime. No, no, no. This thing would be fun to have in
[8503.98s -> 8507.50s]  your bedroom. Just get up in the morning and fucking roundhouse kick this thing as hard as
[8507.50s -> 8510.54s]  you can. And then that's how you start your day. I would start every day like that.
[8511.50s -> 8516.57s]  I would get up in the morning and like kind of get in the shower, comb my hair, and then just
[8516.57s -> 8522.25s]  do the hardest spinning roundhouse kick I could and fucking destroy this thing. And then I'm ready
[8522.25s -> 8544.39s]  for the day. Let's go. Jump. You can do it. You can do it. You can pull your hernia every morning.
[8545.11s -> 8560.33s]  I already have a hernia, man. I'm fucking falling apart. All right, let go. Let go.
[8565.83s -> 8585.19s]  Lost 0.3 pounds. Okay. Time for some stretches. Stop punching the cat. I'm not punching.
[8586.15s -> 8606.01s]  That's how hard I'm pressing A. Which way? 19. Oh, 0.6 pounds.
[8607.93s -> 8619.38s]  Lost a full pound. All right, play. That was close. What the fuck is this? This is No More
[8619.38s -> 8628.98s]  Heroes 2. No More Heroes 3 is releasing in 2020. We're all really excited about it.
[8629.78s -> 8646.76s]  One more. One more. Yeah. When will we get No More Streamer? I don't know.
[8653.26s -> 8655.42s]  I feel like I'm gonna break my nunchuck if I keep doing this.
[8660.15s -> 8684.50s]  Go, go, go, go, go. That was pretty good. Lined up like that. Beat my record. 23. Oh, God. Okay.
[8684.50s -> 8691.45s]  Speed. One of the finest fucking quality food. 18.4 pounds. That's good.
[8692.33s -> 8723.59s]  Oh, she's 25 when I started. All right. Take a quick dump. Save more. Watch the anime. Watch
[8723.59s -> 8731.69s]  the secret anime. All right. Where's the secret boss? Is the secret boss somewhere here?
[8732.33s -> 8741.00s]  Do it. What do you mean do it? Do I have to wait out? It's in the lore. What? I have to watch
[8741.00s -> 8754.07s]  the anime. The anime is the secret boss. Get this.
[8759.35s -> 8774.57s]  Is this a TV? Is this a show? Why is it like a TV? Like, what is this? Where's the secret boss?
[8775.29s -> 8818.98s]  Okay, I was watching that. That's too fucking bad. You missed the boss. You're lying to me. There's
[8818.98s -> 8839.11s]  no boss at the end of a tape. There is. Hold on. There is? Unironically not lying?
[8841.58s -> 8852.04s]  What do you mean? It's at the end of a tape? Yup. What do you mean yup? Go back to the motel.
[8858.38s -> 8873.70s]  We're telling the truth. You're being manipulated. Put up another video over the cringe.
[8874.58s -> 8934.79s]  Okay. Hang tight for a sec. Sit right here for a minute. I'm going to turn it on in just a moment.
[8937.75s -> 8952.28s]  Hey. I didn't want you to see it yet. What is this? Travis, there's a new challenger coming after
[8952.28s -> 8963.46s]  you. Stop. Stop. There's a new challenger coming after your ranking. Her name is Kimi Hoel.
[8964.10s -> 8983.35s]  Is this the secret boss? I mean, do you guys really give a shit if it's stretched?
[8984.55s -> 8995.24s]  I don't. Okay. She's an all-American beam katana champion. Head over to the university
[8995.24s -> 8998.76s]  again to see for yourself. I've got some other info for you too. The guys who killed your friend
[8998.76s -> 9003.99s]  Bishop. I've dredged up some details on them. This one's on the house. Looks like they were
[9003.99s -> 9008.39s]  henchmen from the pizza bat group. That means they are hiding somewhere in town. The rest is up to
[9008.39s -> 9086.12s]  you. Okay, let's put it on. Is there actually a boss fight here? Where's the boss? There's nothing
[9086.12s -> 9102.81s]  here. You were wrong. Thanks for the lie, liars. Where the hell is it? Being lied to. There's no
[9102.81s -> 9117.54s]  secret boss. It's a lie. It's a lie. Revenge mission now available. It's death time. Okay,
[9117.54s -> 9122.18s]  so ranking challenge or revenge mission one. Is this what you were talking about?
[9123.82s -> 9130.57s]  I want to do these other things. There's so much stuff to do. Kimi is the secret boss. Do it now.
[9132.25s -> 9141.00s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. Do I have to do this revenge mission right now? What are you guys talking
[9141.00s -> 9148.62s]  about? Is it time sensitive? I don't believe a single word you're saying. You can do it later.
[9148.62s -> 9162.98s]  Yeah, there's a time sensitive. Get out of here. Santa destroys being monopolized. Everywhere you
[9162.98s -> 9167.46s]  look it's pizza bat, pizza bat, pizza bat. Soon there'll be nowhere to get a juicy t-bone.
[9168.66s -> 9173.86s]  And my lead cook got mad cow disease and butchered my entire kitchen staff. Can you help me?
[9174.82s -> 9182.15s]  Uh, wow. Continue holding the button to cook the steak. Cook the steaks the way the customers
[9182.15s -> 9195.11s]  want them. And the meat. Ah, this is gonna be awesome. Rare, medium, well done.
[9204.26s -> 9216.14s]  Oops, that was right out of the back. Rare. There we go.
[9232.50s -> 9249.98s]  That's too done. Perfect. This is making me hungry.
[9263.77s -> 9267.21s]  All right. Help me out here. When you go to a restaurant
[9269.13s -> 9274.65s]  and this steak on the menu, is it rude to order a steak well done at a restaurant? Are you saying
[9274.65s -> 9280.30s]  that, Hey, I always thought that was like, Oh, the chef's an asshole or something, right? Like,
[9280.30s -> 9285.30s]  Hey, I'm ordering a steak well done at your restaurant. I think you're an asshole, right?
[9285.86s -> 9295.61s]  That's kind of how it's seen. If I'm, that's the etiquette. That's a fuck you.
[9302.55s -> 9309.48s]  They hate it. Why do I always have this image of some chef, some waiter coming over the ticket
[9309.48s -> 9313.80s]  being like, Hey, the guy at table seven wants a well done steak, steak well done. And they just
[9313.80s -> 9321.16s]  start crashing the place. Fucking steak well done. Pots all over the place. Is that like what
[9321.16s -> 9328.30s]  happened? Do I watch too much fucking cooking American TV where everything is a constant
[9328.30s -> 9333.10s]  problem in the kitchen? See as somebody that watches American TV based on cooking shows,
[9334.78s -> 9339.10s]  it's fucking mayhem back there every second of every hour. Is that true?
[9340.46s -> 9349.11s]  It's just constant conflict. What was wrong with that?
[9349.11s -> 9365.74s]  Like is there always, is this just drama? Like do the chefs all hate each other?
[9366.38s -> 9390.22s]  That guy wanted medium? What? It's the quick little seer. Disgusting. Absolutely revolting,
[9390.22s -> 9397.70s]  if I'm honest with you. Taking out of the package, putting it on one side for five seconds on the
[9397.70s -> 9408.25s]  other side for five seconds. No, that's not for me. Blue. Oh, it's cooking faster.
[9413.64s -> 9417.32s]  What do you mean tastes like shit? That was well done. What was wrong with that?
[9418.36s -> 9434.17s]  That's fucking well done. It's green mate. I cooked it till it was green. That's well done.
[9434.17s -> 9458.47s]  Well done. Perfect. Why does everybody want well done steak here?
[9467.40s -> 9481.11s]  There we go. An actual human medium. Give it to me raw. Whoa. Give it to me burnt. What the fuck?
[9481.91s -> 9498.22s]  We're all insulting you. Well done. I don't even fucking like steak. Steak sucks. Like I don't
[9498.22s -> 9503.74s]  even eat it. Why am I pretending like I'm some kind of, you know, did you say you got an order
[9503.74s -> 9510.14s]  from a chef? Does the chef like you? I don't know. What the fuck? What do I care? I don't even like
[9510.14s -> 9530.92s]  steak. I like some steak. Some of it. I mean, I like steak and cheese subs, but that's just like
[9530.92s -> 9546.74s]  a carved up fucking hamburger. Steakums. Yeah. And I would like someone to come to tell me the
[9546.74s -> 9551.50s]  problem with it with a steak. I'd love to know what it is. Take a look at the back of the box
[9551.50s -> 9555.26s]  on a steak. Oh, steak comes on the free. Look at the back of that box. You want to know what's in
[9555.26s -> 9563.91s]  it. You want to know what's in steak? 100% just beef. There's nothing else in it. There's literally
[9563.91s -> 9569.91s]  nothing else in it. It's just meat is no fucking like fillers and emulsifiers and oils. No, it's
[9570.39s -> 9575.64s]  frozen meat. That's all it is. This is not a joke. This is me telling you real life.
[9576.71s -> 9580.95s]  This is not a comedy routine. This is me telling you, look at the back of the box. Next time you
[9580.95s -> 9585.59s]  go to the grocery store and you get steak, it's just 100% beef. It just is. I don't know. But
[9585.59s -> 9590.70s]  does that mean it's like eyeballs? I don't know. I have no idea, but it's real. There's nothing
[9590.70s -> 9613.30s]  else in it. Look it up. Look this up. What is really in steak? New lawsuit reveals the world's
[9613.30s -> 9619.34s]  grossest meat products, probably Steak'ems. We thought pink slime was bad. Turns out the stuff
[9619.34s -> 9623.34s]  hails in comparison to Steak'ems, which the name alone should tell you is bad news.
[9623.34s -> 9627.34s]  But the uninitiated Steak'ems are not dog food, but are instead kind of like frozen DIY Philly
[9627.34s -> 9631.10s]  cheesesteak. But in a trademark infringement suit this week that pitted Steak'ems owners
[9631.10s -> 9634.86s]  against the self-philly cheesesteak and pizza shop named Steak'em Up, the ugly truth of the
[9634.86s -> 9639.82s]  mass-produced sandwich steak was revealed and the details are pretty bleak. This is 2012, by the way.
[9640.78s -> 9650.26s]  Okay. In courtroom proceedings, the composition of the meat came to light. The Daily News reports
[9650.82s -> 9654.90s]  that it's chopped, formed, and emulsified meat product that is comprised of beef trimmings
[9654.90s -> 9659.62s]  left over after an animal is slaughtered and all the primary cuts, such as tenderloin, fillet,
[9659.62s -> 9664.34s]  and ribeye are removed. The emulsified meat is pressed into a loaf and sliced and frozen.
[9665.14s -> 9688.49s]  Okay. Steak'ems are not ribeye steak. Who cares? Yeah. Fine. Not emulsified.
[9690.22s -> 9696.70s]  Did I say that? Well, no. What did I say? I said there were no emulsifiers in it.
[9697.50s -> 9701.10s]  I said no emulsifiers. That doesn't mean it was not emulsified previously,
[9701.10s -> 9709.83s]  but not in the package. There's no emulsifiers. There are no, like for instance, there's no like
[9709.83s -> 9717.35s]  egg yolk or there's no like oil. Could they have crushed it up and emulsified it in a big machine?
[9717.35s -> 9722.28s]  Yeah. But not here. Not when it's in the package. Why am I defending it? I don't know. I like them.
[9723.08s -> 9732.15s]  Is something wrong with me liking steak'ems? Yeah. It's like fucking, it's like trimmings.
[9732.87s -> 9741.53s]  Guess what's in a McDonald's hamburger? Not filet mignon. You know what's in a Wendy's hamburger?
[9742.41s -> 9757.56s]  Yeah. All pure like filet mignon meat. I got some money for that though. What am I talking about?
[9758.20s -> 9761.88s]  You eat McDonald's and you eat Wendy's and you're telling me that I'm crazy for eating steak'ems?
[9761.88s -> 9776.70s]  It's the same shit. Just one's different. One's like shaved and put in a different box. My best
[9776.70s -> 9792.62s]  tile layer actually fell. You're eating dog food. Please. Shaved. They make the patties thicker and
[9792.62s -> 9799.86s]  they send the fucking rest of McDonald's or wherever they go. Oh, this is just Tetris.
[9800.42s -> 9813.11s]  Okay. Rotate. Oh boy. Wait. Wait, what do I have to fill this whole thing in?
[9813.11s -> 9820.12s]  Oh, this ain't, this is never going to happen.
[9832.44s -> 9838.58s]  They can get it all up. All right. I got worked up because people were fucking flaming steak'ems.
[9838.58s -> 9871.16s]  That sounds pretty good actually. Oh man. Just pick it all up. Look at this again. Okay. Now. Dog food
[9871.16s -> 9902.47s]  brain. No, I'm not another dog food brain. This dude sucks. Well, whatever. I don't have trouble
[9902.47s -> 9908.30s]  with this shit. I'm not allowed to have a little bit of trouble with some shit.
[9909.10s -> 9927.72s]  Of course I can. I can have trouble with whatever I want. I don't know, just a square? You have to
[9927.72s -> 9936.39s]  be perfect. I know. And I don't know. I have no, I don't know. I'll get it eventually when I get,
[9936.39s -> 9940.71s]  I'm not doing level three. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't even pay attention to this right
[9940.71s -> 9948.79s]  now. It's like too much for me right now. Maybe like this. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[9948.79s -> 9990.47s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Got it. I don't know. I don't know. It's got to be like
[9991.85s -> 10007.61s]  here. I mean that where else he's got worms in his brain.
[10012.79s -> 10020.66s]  Steak'ems brain. No, we're not going to slander any companies. No, no, no company slandering.
[10020.66s -> 10031.62s]  Okay. I can't do it. I can't. This is not right. This is wrong.
[10034.74s -> 10055.08s]  This is wrong. It's wrong. No, no. I'm going to run out of time. No, don't I level one? I can't.
[10055.08s -> 10065.72s]  You can't do this to me. No, you can't do this to me. Wait and then I got it.
[10065.72s -> 10091.24s]  Oh, I don't. Fuck. Oh, fuck you. God damn it. Did it? No, it what? Oh, I didn't.
[10091.24s -> 10159.58s]  I hate this piece. I can't. It's a stupid Z. Z's fucking me up bad. Wait, hold on. You piece of
[10159.66s -> 10211.83s]  shit. You piece of shit. No.
[10212.39s -> 10215.91s]  Fuck.
[10239.74s -> 10253.96s]  A termite could do this. No, you don't understand. You don't understand. No, you don't understand.
[10257.59s -> 10283.13s]  Which one is it? It's so close. I had it. Oh, don't have it. What do you mean? Yellow, yellow,
[10283.13s -> 10287.77s]  yellow. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? Yellow? What do I put yellow over here?
[10297.74s -> 10303.59s]  Done. What? What are you talking about? How do you mean done? I had it. What are you talking about?
[10303.59s -> 10313.56s]  What are you saying? I'm second guessing. Second guessing me. What? Oh my God. What? Turn off the
[10313.56s -> 10333.02s]  console. No. It's too big. Keep the yellow there. What am I supposed to do with this guy?
[10333.98s -> 10343.75s]  Put the red in the bottom left. What? Move the yellow.
[10348.38s -> 10353.90s]  I physically cannot do these puzzles. I can't do them. I can't do them. I can't even see them
[10353.90s -> 10378.62s]  right. You fucked it up twice. Wait, I got it. Just do this. Where is it? Over here? I have it.
[10378.62s -> 10383.48s]  It's done, but it's not done. I can't do it. I can't do it. No. You don't understand. I can't
[10383.48s -> 10394.71s]  do it. Did you see that? Where did it go? Why? What happened? I can't flip it. I don't know.
[10395.91s -> 10429.05s]  How do I get it to be over there? I picked a great day to start doing CBD oil, by the way.
[10429.05s -> 10434.94s]  What a great day to start it during this.
[10434.94s -> 10465.98s]  Okay. I need to focus on this. This is important. This is very important.
[10468.38s -> 10474.62s]  I was like, there's no way a noble hero is going to have anything that could fuck me up right now.
[10475.10s -> 10489.88s]  No way. I was wrong. All right. I'm looking at a fucking guide. I don't even care.
[10492.68s -> 10502.49s]  Just give me the thing. Okay. Good. Yeah. For those of you that don't know,
[10505.29s -> 10513.19s]  I have bone problems. One of those bone problems, trying it out. I just started it,
[10513.19s -> 10518.89s]  actually literally yesterday. I'm trying to see if CBD helps with the pain.
[10520.73s -> 10524.65s]  We're testing it out. Welcome to the test. Okay. Let's finish this.
[10527.77s -> 10532.89s]  Works pretty good for pain. Not so good on trying to understand where pieces of a thing go on screen.
[10533.85s -> 10548.07s]  Wait. This is not even accurate. You gave me the wrong... This is wrong. This shit's wrong, man.
[10548.95s -> 10561.37s]  Shit's wrong. You got it wrong. You got it wrong. It don't even fit there. Look at the guide.
[10562.01s -> 10570.63s]  I can't flip it. There is no flipping. I can't flip the piece. It only does this or this.
[10573.64s -> 10589.90s]  You gave me the wrong guide, and I'm the dumb one. What are you going to say about that?
[10589.90s -> 10607.03s]  This is the same thing I had last time. Fuck. Somebody give me a different guide. I can't. It
[10607.03s -> 10614.38s]  won't fit. Right in the bottom left. Well, give me a different guide. What are you guys... You guys
[10614.38s -> 10620.30s]  were spamming me with the incorrect guide. You gave me the wrong guide. Somebody was just fucking
[10620.30s -> 10626.78s]  with me. This is completely different than that one. This is 1000% different. This is not even
[10626.78s -> 10630.62s]  remotely similar to the guide that you were linking. We have the last of 30 straight hours.
[10634.28s -> 10641.66s]  Okay. This piece don't even fit here, man. This doesn't fit here. This is wrong too.
[10643.78s -> 10653.72s]  What are you doing to me? Yellow in the bottom right, and then this shit don't even fit.
[10654.84s -> 10665.34s]  What the fuck? No. You can't. Swap the red and the purple. Why do you give me these?
[10670.23s -> 10676.39s]  God, this is fucking ridiculous. What do you mean swap the red and the purple? That doesn't do
[10676.39s -> 10696.14s]  anything. You guys gave me two wrong things. Use this guy. Swap green and blue. I gotta do it again.
[10697.10s -> 10706.02s]  This is fucking hilarious. Holy shit. Do I have it? Wait. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[10706.02s -> 10727.56s]  wait, wait, wait. Is that right? Perfect. Perfect. No, you linked me this before and it's wrong.
[10727.56s -> 10733.02s]  It's not even accurate. Just play the meat game. No, I have to beat this.
[10738.74s -> 10744.20s]  That image is wrong. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. It's not even right.
[10756.98s -> 10772.97s]  So what was wrong with this one? Somebody gave me a fake one. You guys are giving me fake ones.
[10772.97s -> 10803.35s]  This dude is so disappointed in you. He's too high. No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm taking a small dose
[10804.15s -> 10808.47s]  to see how it works for pain relief and it actually works pretty very, very good so far.
[10809.03s -> 10895.88s]  I'm gonna give it a week. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. Wait. Hey, look at me. That was, I can't
[10895.88s -> 10904.26s]  fucking believe it took that long. All right. I just had to prove that I wasn't like the dumbest
[10904.26s -> 10908.10s]  person you've ever watched on live stream. I just needed to make sure I wanted, let's do the
[10908.10s -> 10933.13s]  hamburger one. You still are. Ban that person. How dare you say that to me? Idiot, idiot, idiot,
[10933.13s -> 10951.03s]  idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot. There you go. There's your, this is your brain on drugs. No,
[10951.59s -> 10960.31s]  I'm on a very small dose. Okay. I'm on like three grams of CBD. Okay. It's like,
[10961.11s -> 10971.74s]  it's not even like a quarter of a regular one. That's a shit load. What?
[10974.92s -> 10997.50s]  No, three milligrams. No, not three. I just rammed with that. CBD doesn't make you high. There's THC
[10997.50s -> 11014.47s]  in this thing that I have. It's 3.3 milligrams of THC, which is not a whole lot, but I don't want a
[11014.47s -> 11033.24s]  whole lot. I just want to just try to do a little trial for pain relief. Yeah. The goal is for me
[11033.24s -> 11045.98s]  to not to get, I'm not trying to get fucked up. Who really wants us to believe him? Share your weed
[11045.98s -> 11068.06s]  brownie recipe. I don't have one. Jeremy, you're doing fine. Hey, thanks. I can't play Jump King
[11068.06s -> 11075.34s]  ever again. I deleted my, I'm not starting at zero. Heard nothing but good things about
[11075.34s -> 11086.86s]  CBD and inflammation. Yes. Especially the idea is if I have neuralgia, if I have nerve pain,
[11086.86s -> 11092.86s]  just nerve damage somehow, and there's only a few things I can really do to try to counteract it.
[11093.98s -> 11101.80s]  So there, it's, you know, it's out there that for potentially nerve pain,
[11102.76s -> 11119.24s]  THC and CBD can maybe help. So I'm trying. I wasn't going to talk about it, but why would I care to
[11119.24s -> 11124.84s]  even bring it up if I'm doing like a small dose of CBD and THC? Like, well, I don't care. But like,
[11124.84s -> 11128.36s]  if you can't do a children's puzzle in like 30 minutes, then like it's, I probably should,
[11128.36s -> 11142.60s]  I should probably tell you. Started a week ago. Yeah. I'm going to give it like two weeks.
[11143.32s -> 11150.54s]  Just doing like a very small dose. And I don't know. I'm not going to tell you that it's,
[11150.54s -> 11158.66s]  I don't want a placebo effect to happen here, but we'll see in a week. How do I feel? I feel
[11158.66s -> 11166.90s]  pretty good. I feel good. And I guess thankfully that was, whoa, that was fine. The really good
[11166.90s -> 11179.91s]  part is it's medium. That's, that's a medium steak. It's legal in Las Vegas, though.
[11182.31s -> 11192.87s]  How is that not well done? You want it more than that? Like that? You don't want to eat that,
[11192.87s -> 11205.53s]  right? That's why he moved there. It was becoming legal in Massachusetts too,
[11205.53s -> 11228.46s]  before I left. So that's not why that was well done. He just couldn't wait. I feel like I'm
[11228.46s -> 11247.59s]  playing somebody's a monster hunter. I feel like I'm playing monster hunter. Play the actual game.
[11248.95s -> 11268.63s]  Yeah, I will eventually click link now, click link now, click link. Stakeham emerges as unlikely
[11268.63s -> 11290.78s]  coronavirus and misinformation watchdog. What? Wait, during a crisis, people turned to many
[11290.78s -> 11294.62s]  different places for advice, wisdom, and comfort during the global coronavirus pandemic. Many
[11294.62s -> 11300.94s]  are tapping an unlikely source, a processed meat brand. Stakehams, the decades-old maker of thin
[11300.94s -> 11306.06s]  sliced frozen beef used in cheese steak sandwiches, has garnered considerable attention on social
[11306.06s -> 11310.22s]  media during the coronavirus crisis with a Twitter thread warning people to question their news
[11310.22s -> 11322.30s]  sources amid a torrent of misinformation about the virus. Did I just eat the onion? Is this real?
[11322.30s -> 11341.42s]  This is real, right? Okay, no, it's real. Oh, Stakehams. Yeah, Stakehams. All right, now
[11341.42s -> 11353.62s]  let's do the actual mission. People who uses a craft Facebook, who uses like Stakehams Facebook
[11353.62s -> 11367.94s]  as their news source. That is a little, that's a little odd. Go to the university. I'm gonna,
[11367.94s -> 11376.60s]  I need to save the game. Secret boss, you can miss it. Go to the university. I'm going.
[11380.81s -> 11410.50s]  Oh, Stakehams. Oh, whatever. All right, university. To the university. Is this the university?
[11410.50s -> 11423.16s]  Where's the university? At the university? Wait, that's the university. It's right here.
[11424.20s -> 11429.82s]  Wait, what are you talking about? It's just the next mission. How is this a secret?
[11430.46s -> 11460.02s]  I had to unlock. Are you prepared? Oh, you found the hidden boss? You fucking kidding me?
[11460.66s -> 11465.46s]  You think I should try to swear less? Like really? Would I be active about it? Should I just think
[11465.46s -> 11474.63s]  about, you know, what am I saying here? Should I, should I stop swearing? Place words. Should I
[11474.63s -> 11484.09s]  start saying like fuck? Should I say like look out or shit? Shit's fine. My mother told me she
[11484.09s -> 11500.65s]  wants me to stop saying the F word. Gotcha. By the way, big fan. Look at you. Gotcha. Swearing is for
[11500.65s -> 11518.70s]  CBD users. What was that? Oh, it must have been the secret boss. What the fuck?
[11519.18s -> 11521.74s]  What the fuck!
[11523.98s -> 11525.98s]  Sorry mom we both did it.
[11526.56s -> 11533.71s]  Damn.
[11538.25s -> 11544.68s]  All right, get him.

[11548.68s -> 11559.67s]  Come on punch punch punch kick kick kick kick kick kick
[11573.08s -> 11577.76s]  Why am I laughing at that that's I shouldn't be laughing at this
[11594.78s -> 11597.32s]  God was a pain in the ass
[11600.34s -> 11602.34s]  Oh
[11623.27s -> 11628.57s]  Yeah, if you read this you're stoned
[11652.88s -> 11661.30s]  Extra cranked when they're a movie with Jason Statham where if he's if his blood pressure dropped
[11661.46s -> 11670.07s]  Was heart rate dropped by certain percent by a certain amount. He was his heart exploded that movie must have been crazy
[11670.07s -> 11673.23s]  I wish it was public domain. I would love to watch it
[11675.27s -> 11678.19s]  Can I can I do that on Amazon the Amazon twitch watch party thing?
[11678.83s -> 11681.78s]  Could we watch crank?
[11681.82s -> 11692.88s]  terms of service
[11692.88s -> 11698.19s]  It was a secret boss boys

[11705.80s -> 11707.80s]  understand executive order
[11708.20s -> 11713.32s]  The movie crank hi put to the Library of Congress. Can I call you Travis the great?
[11713.88s -> 11717.04s]  Travis ravenous cool hand teasy-greasy
[11722.72s -> 11725.88s]  What a fan of me
[11727.02s -> 11732.70s]  Yes, I watched your fight with Charlie too. Oh, you were hard core
[11733.50s -> 11735.50s]  so cool
[11735.74s -> 11737.74s]  No, I am cool
[11739.66s -> 11744.30s]  Yeah, but you hate girls who puke never really thought about it
[11747.87s -> 11753.63s]  Don't stare at me you're staring at me if you get me preggers promise you won't ditch me, okay
[11754.27s -> 11758.07s]  Anyway, I wrote down all my feelings in the letter here. Take it
[11759.07s -> 11762.47s]  Your feelings so this is a love letter
[11763.15s -> 11765.55s]  Take it take it or I'll totally die
[11767.69s -> 11774.09s]  Okay, thanks. I could use a dose of innocence that last fight got a little sick even for me

[11836.49s -> 11842.13s]  I embarked on this path and ended up winning the national student assassin championship
[11842.13s -> 11846.97s]  I really did my best, but you know in hindsight, it was a cinch
[11846.97s -> 11853.17s]  I guess I'm just blessed. I can master in one day techniques that would take others years to do
[11853.53s -> 11862.41s]  Pretty awesome, right and then I got greedy a new urge a vision that just maybe I could win a fight against Travis the great

[13763.58s -> 13778.24s]  I can't read don't read
[13778.32s -> 13780.32s]  It doesn't want you to read read what?
[13785.26s -> 13790.51s]  I promised I would play tamed fortress
[13790.99s -> 13796.35s]  How I know that's incorrect because no I did not why would I ever say that when did I say that?
[13802.32s -> 13804.32s]  I was drunk when I said it
[13806.00s -> 13806.32s]  No
[13806.32s -> 13812.00s]  I said I will play the first game that people write and somebody wrote jump king and then a thousand people wrote tf2
[13812.00s -> 13814.00s]  And they thought they were first, but they weren't
[13814.00s -> 13825.50s]  And I think I remember that
[13825.50s -> 13828.54s]  You said cinco de mayo tf2. No, I did not
[13829.58s -> 13831.58s]  No find a clip
[13831.58s -> 13833.28s]  I'll be waiting
[13833.28s -> 13834.96s]  I'll be waiting
[13834.96s -> 13848.45s]  I gotta get a good swing here
[13849.17s -> 13859.02s]  Somebody get the clip. All right. He's roaring. Is he roaring? Here we go
[13869.50s -> 13872.58s]  Jesus I deleted the clip
[13889.73s -> 13895.76s]  Jump he farted ha ha ha damn it. We're going to get that clip of where he farted
[13904.30s -> 13906.86s]  That was easy
[13906.86s -> 13911.15s]  How can one chat be so wrong?
[13912.51s -> 13914.69s]  I don't know
[13914.69s -> 13916.86s]  Tell me you're in it
[13918.80s -> 13922.32s]  Play tf2 play tf2 play tf2 play tf2
[13922.96s -> 13927.62s]  Let's see the validity of this
[13928.42s -> 13930.26s]  Fortress
[13930.26s -> 13933.78s]  Uh, that's you just that way you clipped that from 35 seconds ago
[13934.34s -> 13936.02s]  Not a really good

[13952.72s -> 13955.60s]  It's close, but it doesn't matter how close it is. I'm not doing it
[13962.77s -> 13965.97s]  Promise nobody can come up with a clip of me saying this weird
[13972.42s -> 13974.42s]  Usually you guys are really really quick about this
[13975.30s -> 13992.67s]  Not today apparently music trouble in your virtual world

[14061.63s -> 14064.75s]  What is it?
[14064.83s -> 14066.83s]  Um, but I i'm hold on
[14067.71s -> 14069.71s]  I didn't say I was gonna play this
[14070.99s -> 14072.96s]  on tuesday
[14072.96s -> 14076.96s]  I drunkenly said say any game and then people wrote tf2 and I said no
[14078.62s -> 14081.58s]  So what are you talking about? That was like a week ago
[14085.14s -> 14090.06s]  Oh shit, i'm gonna die
[14090.06s -> 14091.26s]  Get up
[14091.26s -> 14102.32s]  Gonna knock me back to normal
[14106.80s -> 14107.92s]  No
[14107.92s -> 14110.35s]  You said do you play any game?
[14110.35s -> 14113.31s]  I said, yeah that night and then I said I don't want to play tf2 and I was like
[14113.71s -> 14116.35s]  And jump king was the one I played and I deleted my save file
[14116.99s -> 14131.26s]  I'm not playing tf2
[14133.52s -> 14138.00s]  That it was because of the download time
[14139.90s -> 14141.97s]  Yeah, it is
[14141.97s -> 14143.17s]  big
[14143.17s -> 14149.44s]  Big excuse
[14149.52s -> 14151.18s]  Get them all
[14151.18s -> 14161.74s]  Yes, it's a bad excuse
[14161.98s -> 14165.18s]  Oh here here. I've got a i've got a really good excuse for you
[14166.30s -> 14168.30s]  I don't want to play it
[14169.28s -> 14171.28s]  Okay, that's good. All right. I'm
[14172.40s -> 14174.40s]  We've got it. All right
[14175.20s -> 14177.92s]  But is this like a fucking homework assignment that I didn't turn in
[14193.74s -> 14199.34s]  It takes one hour and 30 minutes to download no, I can probably get it in like no, all right
[14201.08s -> 14203.08s]  Silence silence
[14204.32s -> 14207.22s]  Silence
[14207.22s -> 14210.50s]  I don't want to play fucking tf2. I have no
[14211.54s -> 14216.02s]  Bone in my whole body right now wants to download and install and play tf2
[14216.50s -> 14221.86s]  I don't have a bone in my body right now. That's like that's do that. No, that's not gonna happen
[14222.58s -> 14224.58s]  I have to be honest and real with you

[14229.84s -> 14231.84s]  So whatever we're gonna we want him to do
[14232.00s -> 14235.52s]  Maybe we'll turn he'll turn face game on if we go dot dot dot
[14240.61s -> 14242.61s]  Nope, that's not gonna happen
[14248.21s -> 14251.33s]  Oh, you said silence it well, yes stay that way

[14277.79s -> 14297.94s]  It was an excuse as to why I couldn't do a four-year-old's puzzle quarter ounce if it wasn't a quarter
[14298.26s -> 14300.26s]  Us
[14301.14s -> 14306.18s]  All right, all right no more no more I demand silence again
[14313.66s -> 14338.27s]  Who's this boss? That's a really good image there. It's just what it looks like through his glasses take them off, dude
[14360.78s -> 14368.72s]  He looks so stupid
[14368.72s -> 14370.88s]  My it really is a minecraft skin
[14383.95s -> 14386.74s]  Either that or a powerade bottle
[14402.13s -> 14404.13s]  Blame thrower
[14410.82s -> 14415.98s]  Psychotic fucker time for a little pro bono ghost busting. All right
[14427.42s -> 14429.42s]  All right, what do you do who you moved
[14430.38s -> 14434.38s]  Let's see. You got a oh boy an overhead slash
[14435.50s -> 14438.14s]  Oh another overhead slash can't dodge it
[14446.72s -> 14448.72s]  Oh nice overhead slash
[14450.53s -> 14463.65s]  Oh magnetic
[14465.25s -> 14468.96s]  All right, don't be cocky here
[14471.78s -> 14483.94s]  I'm your later sounds
[14484.42s -> 14488.00s]  Trick to you. It's egypt
[14490.61s -> 14492.61s]  Oh fuck i'm gonna die
[14492.61s -> 14496.51s]  Get out of the way, man
[14503.98s -> 14510.30s]  Run, okay. I felt like I had a lot of health for a second there and now I don't have any
[14511.42s -> 14513.92s]  What happened?
[14513.92s -> 14518.21s]  He's got killed by a pyro
[14518.53s -> 14524.22s]  I got full. Um, okay
[14525.86s -> 14535.41s]  wall
[14535.41s -> 14537.09s]  F'ing stupid
[14537.09s -> 14547.65s]  All right, this is f'ing stupid
[14548.13s -> 14561.49s]  Dogs underneath it
[14561.49s -> 14567.49s]  Yes, I can
[14569.81s -> 14571.81s]  I can't tell if that's hurting me or not
[14584.26s -> 14595.90s]  All right, get out get out get out fire I think yeah, all right in
[14612.64s -> 14617.66s]  Fire, you know
[14617.66s -> 14619.42s]  Oh, I caught it
[14619.42s -> 14623.90s]  Hey, I was spinning my hand around
[14624.70s -> 14630.02s]  Dude, I was spinning around like crazy
[14630.50s -> 14666.26s]  Yeah, well i'm dead I go no you gotta spin you gotta spin it i'm just gonna just run around in a circle
[14672.45s -> 14680.77s]  Yeah, that's not hitting me
[14681.89s -> 14683.89s]  How do I get away from that one though
[14685.01s -> 14687.01s]  What if it's
[14692.38s -> 14697.50s]  There's so many stupid fucking boxes everywhere here they just block you fast let's destroy them all
[14698.46s -> 14704.52s]  Like just cut the whole fucking place down before you fight clear the wii area didn't you learn anything
[14722.82s -> 14724.82s]  I'm doing it
[14732.06s -> 14734.24s]  I can't block it
[14734.48s -> 14744.58s]  It's like when you move the camera moves with you. So it's like just kind of all over the place
[14747.22s -> 14751.14s]  If you want to dodge to the left it actually ends up making you dodge like in a weird place and you don't want to go
[14758.86s -> 14770.85s]  I'm gonna swing once and then run backwards. Let's do this. You have to get perfect dodges
[14793.31s -> 14806.16s]  So, okay is a perfect dodge actually hitting the dodge button or is it just side step
[14818.85s -> 14820.53s]  side step
[14820.53s -> 14825.39s]  Kind of hard to even tell if i'm dodging
[14837.95s -> 14839.95s]  Side slash is the one that's not dodging
[14843.01s -> 14845.01s]  Walk it right
[14845.17s -> 14848.18s]  Dodge at the right time, which would be
[14850.69s -> 14862.58s]  Through dark step is way harder in this game back in the action
[14863.30s -> 14871.82s]  Yeah, because isn't it like they raise their hand up and you run around i've done it once or twice already
[14873.50s -> 14881.18s]  Do I even have the give you have to lock it or something or no?
[14897.17s -> 14902.22s]  Area sucks such ass this area sucks such ass a lot of s's in that one
[14918.43s -> 14920.61s]  Say 10 times in a row
[14920.61s -> 14927.87s]  Serious sucks ass
[14927.87s -> 14935.76s]  Maybe it's that one. I have to dodge your own just dark step. I'm trying
[14936.24s -> 14940.91s]  It's just you just hit left right like there's no like the person plotting with it or just hit left
[14941.63s -> 14946.16s]  I'm just gonna close
[14949.54s -> 14952.18s]  I just did the exact same thing. I did last time I did it and it didn't do it
[14952.42s -> 14956.26s]  Oh
[14965.73s -> 14994.30s]  Can you center bar see you naked? I don't know. All right, here we go get the fuck out of the way
[14994.62s -> 14996.62s]  Oh this place sucks
[14999.26s -> 15001.82s]  Fucking objects everywhere you just bump into
[15009.76s -> 15014.40s]  No, and i'm trying to dodge the other way and you can't you can't do that
[15015.36s -> 15017.36s]  because your body
[15018.16s -> 15043.50s]  I'm trying to dodge left. Why is it going backwards?
[15044.70s -> 15046.70s]  This is a mess
[15051.92s -> 15083.22s]  Dark stuff don't work. I okay i'm trying what the fuck
[15092.35s -> 15098.18s]  Forget the dodge just
[15103.09s -> 15106.77s]  That's what i'm talking about back in the action with the health chest
[15107.81s -> 15109.57s]  No, that wasn't a good run
[15109.57s -> 15117.66s]  Okay, i'm just gonna cheese the fuck out of this boss because I hate this boss. I don't like it
[15118.86s -> 15120.86s]  I don't like this area. I don't like this boss
[15121.90s -> 15127.02s]  Stupid it's fucking stupid. This boss is fucking stupid. The game's fucking stupid. Really mothers are stupid
[15148.30s -> 15151.26s]  Do another fucking move. What the hell?
[15152.40s -> 15180.50s]  what
[15186.08s -> 15197.73s]  Fire my god, this the fucking lock-on is just so stupid here
[15199.42s -> 15202.22s]  It's such a dumb fucking area where it's just
[15206.16s -> 15208.16s]  Actually mad. Yeah
[15208.24s -> 15210.24s]  It's fucking stupid
[15210.48s -> 15237.78s]  What?
[15237.78s -> 15253.17s]  Get up burn the gotcha force disc
[15253.73s -> 15259.62s]  How how do you actually avoid getting hit by that?
[15261.49s -> 15265.81s]  You actually burning. Oh my fucking god just run around the circle. I think I don't know. Is it working?

[15367.02s -> 15369.02s]  Can we get out of this fucking room?
[15369.82s -> 15371.82s]  Why are you in here?
[15373.78s -> 15376.98s]  No, i'm trying to dodge backwards. What the fuck?
[15378.56s -> 15383.44s]  Why is it making me dodge towards or i'm trying to go i'm hitting down on the fucking d-pad man

[22791.66s -> 22794.86s]  I just I don't it's not like i'll never play the game for the rest of my life
[22795.74s -> 22800.22s]  I don't know. I typically would if they come up with something if there's a new update or if they said
[22800.86s -> 22804.38s]  New one or something else to talk about or do or then I would probably try it
[22805.26s -> 22808.78s]  Or just please say slash s
[22810.24s -> 22813.20s]  But I have don't don't have any intention to play it
[22816.54s -> 22817.90s]  I spent
[22817.90s -> 22821.90s]  A decade playing that game and it was it was the best game i've probably ever played
[22822.62s -> 22826.11s]  But you know, I don't it's just not something I really want to do
[22827.58s -> 22831.79s]  I don't know. You gotta pretty missed a frog coin. Nice
[22835.14s -> 22839.22s]  Hey bingo sunshine. Thanks for the 250. What are you fiddling with in the background? We can hear it

[22854.19s -> 22860.43s]  Uh mu means mu. Thanks for three dollars cardboard cutout made of clay. This streamer is really suited on a micro dose
[22861.55s -> 22865.81s]  This is like this is like seven hours ago now guys
[22868.58s -> 22874.58s]  You're referencing that you're referencing something that happened like potentially almost a whole day ago like eight hours ago
[22880.53s -> 22882.45s]  nearly a year ago
[22882.45s -> 22887.52s]  And finally, I will see you guys tomorrow

[22923.94s -> 22926.18s]  I was only able to rip the audio. Unfortunately, okay
[22930.42s -> 22932.03s]  Hey guys
[22932.03s -> 22934.03s]  It's me derma 95
[22934.35s -> 22936.59s]  I'm gonna play tf2 on sync of the mile

[22956.61s -> 22959.15s]  When you show that to me, that's
[22959.15s -> 22961.82s]  I guess I did say those are all things that I would have said
[22964.67s -> 22965.71s]  eating
[22965.71s -> 22967.71s]  Incredibly close to the microphone, too
[22970.64s -> 22973.60s]  I must have had a setting wrong. It got my webcam mic
[22974.48s -> 22977.52s]  I guess i'll have to fucking just lie and not do it
[22979.20s -> 22981.20s]  Hey king of acorns. Thanks for five dollars derma
[22981.20s -> 22986.48s]  I was the one guy who recommended you build the gamer birdhouse and still can't believe you actually did it laughing my fucking ass off
[22986.72s -> 22990.00s]  Does that thing get any use or did it get thrown away? I'm so curious. No, that's gone
[22990.72s -> 22993.28s]  That's gone. Nobody wanted that fucking thing
[22993.76s -> 22996.32s]  That was hideous
[23000.24s -> 23002.56s]  I hit it with a hammer fucking recycled it
[23006.14s -> 23008.14s]  Whatever whatever happened to it
[23008.86s -> 23011.42s]  It was sentimental value there
[23011.42s -> 23018.21s]  Remember you should build a sand castle on stream
[23018.85s -> 23023.14s]  That sounds like a really fun idea

[23027.15s -> 23028.91s]  There's no such thing

[23031.18s -> 23032.30s]  so
[23032.30s -> 23034.30s]  There's plenty of sand
[23034.46s -> 23040.54s]  But not enough sand to make a sand castle because it's not the right kind of wet sand
[23045.07s -> 23052.43s]  How would I would I build a sand castle in with sand but i'd have to wet the sand and have to I would have to drench
[23053.95s -> 23056.90s]  Five acres with water
[23056.90s -> 23058.42s]  bring water
[23058.42s -> 23062.98s]  Use water dumbass just use water bring a water truck rent a water truck

[23101.55s -> 23105.31s]  They were on for like 20 minutes and by the time I found out my entire yard was ruined
[23106.03s -> 23109.23s]  Oh, my scarecrow was out there too. He's fucking dead
[23109.87s -> 23111.87s]  More updates coming soon

[23132.29s -> 23135.33s]  Put a bird house up or put or make soil in their yard
[23135.97s -> 23146.74s]  It's dead
