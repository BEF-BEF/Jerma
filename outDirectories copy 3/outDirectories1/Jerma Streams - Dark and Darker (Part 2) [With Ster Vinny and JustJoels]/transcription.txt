[23.03s -> 34.78s]  Yeah, a little early. How are you? What's happening? Uh, could you guess what we're doing today?
[34.78s -> 41.50s]  Do I really need to tell you about my new obsession? This is one of the reasons why
[41.50s -> 50.42s]  I was afraid of this game. One of the reasons why I didn't want to play it is because I know
[51.06s -> 62.25s]  if I actually liked it, then it was going away in like four days. And then it's going to be,
[62.25s -> 66.73s]  oh, I'm just going to hop on dark and darker. And it's just gone. But who knows how long
[66.73s -> 85.46s]  into maybe like middle of the year or something. It's not coming back, dude. Yes, it is. Yeah. So
[85.46s -> 93.78s]  here's the plan tonight. There are, uh, there are a lot of people that want to play. And last time I
[93.78s -> 100.34s]  played almost completely and totally by myself. I was just alone almost the whole time. So tonight
[101.67s -> 105.99s]  is a lot of people that are streaming right now that I believe I'm going to be hopping around
[105.99s -> 114.68s]  different groups with. So the one that's set in stone, the one that is set in stone
[115.48s -> 125.13s]  is stir and Vinny at six o'clock. Now, now hold on a minute here. I'm very aware of the Metroid news.
[126.01s -> 132.17s]  So I told Vinny, I was like, Hey, I know you, I know you want to play that shit. So don't worry
[132.17s -> 137.48s]  about like, Oh, I said I was going to play. No, no, it's all good. So we're going to be kind of
[137.48s -> 142.36s]  cycling people in and out. And there's some other streamers that have wanted to play it.
[143.08s -> 147.98s]  I don't know how long stir wants to play for, but that's the plan.
[148.62s -> 158.23s]  Did you end up giving that guy's items back? No, I didn't. I don't think I could. The only thing
[158.23s -> 162.15s]  that makes me not feel bad about that is the fact that everything's getting wiped in like four days.
[162.15s -> 170.22s]  Right. Like this, it's, it's, it's okay. The guilt plagues him. No, I'm fine. I told you,
[170.22s -> 174.22s]  I put it down in a corner of my inventory because it's going to be a constant reminder
[174.94s -> 189.93s]  of my SIM, but I'm going to give you a small warning, small warning. This is going to go a
[189.93s -> 197.59s]  long time. This stream is, I'm just going to play it until I don't feel like, until I don't feel like
[197.59s -> 204.39s]  playing it anymore. This stream could go all the way through to like potentially early into the
[204.39s -> 211.05s]  morning hours. I just want to play it. Same kind of ideas before just going to chill out and just
[211.05s -> 218.92s]  go and have fun. Oh, whatever that means. I know I don't think this is going to be a 14 hour stream,
[218.92s -> 225.18s]  but don't be surprised if it's like eight to 10. I'm going to get up. I promise. I've already
[225.18s -> 232.06s]  eaten dinner. I prepared for this day. I I've got a nice green tea, like a nice full hydrating green
[232.06s -> 246.28s]  tea drink, drank a bunch of water, full dinner, pasta, carved. I'm carved up. Yeah. So me,
[246.28s -> 255.00s]  stir and Vinny in like 30 minutes. And then from there we'll see. There's a lot of other people
[255.00s -> 261.03s]  that are probably going to be just jumping in and out. I'll warm up a little. I don't want to be a
[261.03s -> 271.69s]  terrible player when, you know, friends want to play. There's three people. The title needs to
[271.69s -> 279.06s]  be dumb, dumber and dumbest. Yeah. I made it the dumb and dumber sequel title. Dumb, dumber and
[279.06s -> 283.64s]  dumbest. No, I don't want to have it that because everyone will just call me the dumbest one.
[283.64s -> 289.85s]  All right. If it's dumb, dumber and dumbest, I have to be the dumbest one each, no matter who it is.
[290.41s -> 295.64s]  Of all the streamers I'll be playing with, I'll always be dumbest in quotes. And I don't like
[295.64s -> 306.49s]  that. I don't, I'm not into that one. I'm not a fan of that. It could be me, stir and orangutan.
[307.13s -> 311.96s]  And you would probably have the orangutan be smarter than me. Like, oh yeah, the orangutan
[311.96s -> 333.27s]  smarter than you, Jeremy. What'd you say? The orangutan would be the smartest. I'll give you
[333.27s -> 339.67s]  a little bit of insight into a stream that happened. The replace me stream. I wanted to
[339.67s -> 345.98s]  have one of the contestants be an orangutan. Like just kind of walk into the room and like put the
[345.98s -> 352.95s]  headset on and like play Dark Souls kind of good. And it was like, Oh, wow. Okay. Interesting stuff.
[353.59s -> 357.11s]  And it was just sort of going to be a real orangutan that just like was an aquatic,
[357.11s -> 364.36s]  was a contestant. Um, but again, some ideas just don't work and they can't happen.
[365.00s -> 369.85s]  Cause like, I was like, Oh, wouldn't it, wouldn't it be kind of fun? Cause like, obviously I wanted
[369.85s -> 374.17s]  to be like, okay, like how do you like, I want to make sure it's done correctly. Like, you know,
[374.17s -> 379.05s]  some animals that are in movies and TV shows, I would want to have like a real, a legit setup
[379.05s -> 384.41s]  where it's the trainer and it's a, like an orangutan that was, it knew how to do this
[384.41s -> 388.81s]  stuff or used to it. And it was like, no, no like animal cruelty, bullshit, right? I wanted to do
[388.81s -> 392.81s]  it right. And do it like safe and good, even if we had to shoot it separately or something, right?
[393.69s -> 398.09s]  Um, but it's just, it was like too much of a, it was just too much of a hassle. So I was like,
[398.09s -> 410.02s]  nevermind. It's not worth it. But can you imagine just like, Oh, like, okay, like number, uh,
[410.58s -> 414.10s]  number 10, come on in. And it's just like, kind of orangutan just gets up and like sits in the
[414.10s -> 418.42s]  chair and just like puts the headset on, just like hanging out. Like, Oh, so what do you do?
[418.98s -> 423.22s]  Interesting. We kind of look alike. It's going to be like a whole little bit. And I was like, nah,
[423.86s -> 429.18s]  yeah. The more you look into that stuff, you're just like, eh, it's probably not,
[429.18s -> 434.70s]  eh, nah. It's funny for, it was funny up here for like 20 minutes. And then I just didn't write it
[434.70s -> 448.60s]  down and it was over. Orangutan would have swept the votes. It would have won by a landslide.
[449.32s -> 453.37s]  Can you imagine just like an orangutan just sitting on the stage and it's just like, has
[453.37s -> 476.71s]  like 90% it just has 90% of the votes. What is this? And you sing happy birthday to my kids.
[476.71s -> 490.38s]  They aren't going to be born until I'm 30. But if you say no, they're going to cry. So stupid.
[491.30s -> 496.66s]  So what you want to like clip me singing happy birthday. So then in, I don't know how many years
[496.66s -> 505.43s]  that is from where you are now, but then have that to play. That's actually kind of funny to me
[505.43s -> 512.20s]  that like potentially five, 10, whatever years in the future, or even like 30 years in the future,
[512.20s -> 519.24s]  when they're like, I don't know. Oh, it's like George's fucking 16th birthday. I don't know. Oh,
[519.24s -> 525.74s]  and we got a German to do a happy birthday for you by that. I'm not going to be relevant.
[526.30s -> 529.90s]  I'm sorry to say guys, that's people are going to be like, who, who, who is this?
[532.74s -> 536.50s]  That would be so weird though. Cause imagine like some of these like people that have been on like
[536.50s -> 541.30s]  TV or like other like people in, you know, movies or TV shows. Cause a lot of people use Twitch
[541.30s -> 546.42s]  and YouTube as new TV. So 30, 40 years from now, that would be so weird. Imagine if it was just
[546.42s -> 553.06s]  like, Oh, by the way, um, you know, Jeremy, uh, happy, uh, happy 20th birthday. Oh, by the way,
[553.86s -> 559.46s]  Elvis says, has something to say to you like Elvis. What do you mean Elvis? And it's Elvis.
[559.46s -> 564.50s]  She's like, Oh, Hey, Jeremy, how you doing? Happy birthday. Uh, singing a happy birthday song for
[564.50s -> 570.14s]  you. Be like, what the fuck is going on? No, I'm not comparing myself to Elvis. I'm just saying
[570.14s -> 579.02s]  like, it's, it's that same world of, this is weird. No, no, no. I, I'm not comparing myself to
[579.02s -> 593.90s]  Elvis. What an ego. No, I get what you mean. Don't worry. Thank you. One chatter. I appreciate it.
[593.90s -> 609.51s]  Thanks one guy. I think you're going to die on the toilet. That's fine. That, that just doesn't
[609.51s -> 615.64s]  bother me. That's not a big deal to me. That's actually like, I don't know, to me, that's like
[615.64s -> 633.64s]  not really that bad of a place to go. Right? Like that's whatever. Do an Elvis impression.
[633.64s -> 637.08s]  Again, that was wicked funny. No, that see what you're doing is doing the reverse psychology
[637.08s -> 640.44s]  thing where you thought it was a really bad impression and you were like cringing and
[640.44s -> 645.24s]  laughing at it. And you, you want me to like, do it again because you thought it was an embarrassment
[645.24s -> 651.24s]  and you think it's funny that I embarrassed myself in front of 400,000, 500,000 people here. Um,
[652.20s -> 655.24s]  and now you want me to do it again, to do that again. I understand what you're doing.
[664.18s -> 673.14s]  All right, let's go. Remember there's only 9,000 people here. What the fuck? No, there's 500.
[686.28s -> 689.96s]  You guys are not taking into account the amount of insects that watch this stream.
[690.84s -> 696.82s]  I mean, I got a very large demographic of ants and spiders and each colony of ants, you know,
[696.82s -> 701.38s]  there's, there's like, there's like, there's like 200,000 ants in a colony. They're big fans
[702.18s -> 709.72s]  because you're not, you're not, you're only thinking of like the human, um, the human audience,
[709.72s -> 719.80s]  which is, I mean, come on. You're also forgetting about all the food that watches all the, all the,
[719.80s -> 724.30s]  you know, your dogs and cats that are in the room. Like I have, I think I have a pretty
[724.30s -> 730.57s]  unbelievably large sandwich audience and I think that there are probably, I probably have like one
[730.57s -> 739.69s]  of the, I probably have a pretty large ham sandwich demographic, probably like ice cream. It's probably
[739.69s -> 743.85s]  like a, I probably have a very large ice cream audience of like all the ice cream that has been
[743.85s -> 750.84s]  like in front of the, you know, the video while I'm streaming. So yeah, I can say I have a 500,000
[750.84s -> 754.76s]  concurrent view audience because like you're forgetting the ants, the bugs, the dogs, the cats,
[754.76s -> 761.48s]  the ice cream, the sandwiches, the soups. It's a lot of things and people to watch. All right,
[761.48s -> 767.37s]  you guys ready? Stop stalling. I am stalling because I'm just, hey, I'm just warming up.
[768.17s -> 773.43s]  I actually did not see the direct. I heard there was some interesting things in it though.
[785.53s -> 802.92s]  Pikmin 4, we should watch it. No, I'll watch it later. Your jokes are minus two old man.
[803.88s -> 815.67s]  Hey, hey, who asked? Oh shit. Your name is who asked. God damn it. God damn it. Okay.
[816.31s -> 830.82s]  You can take the, you can take the, the win on that one. That's fine. All right. Um, I'm ready.
[830.82s -> 836.14s]  I'm ready to play. I was going to do a round or two. Maybe I'll probably get one round in before
[836.14s -> 840.84s]  Dura's around and Vinny's around. We're playing it by ear tonight because I'm going to be live
[840.84s -> 859.69s]  pretty much all night. Okay. Uh, let's go. Y'all know mead one. Uh, I have a confession. I, Holly
[859.69s -> 876.28s]  and I were playing, so I have a few new things. Look at this shit. Holly and I killed a group of
[876.28s -> 887.54s]  three and one of them had this stuff. And I almost have enough to buy a purple. I also have something
[887.54s -> 896.63s]  else to say too. Playing this game with another person is 100 times easier. Holly and I played
[897.03s -> 905.98s]  10 games and we got out, I think seven or eight times. It's so much more of like a ridiculous
[905.98s -> 918.31s]  experience alone. I think I made it out five times in eight hours two nights ago. It's just,
[918.87s -> 922.47s]  the stress levels are so much lower when there's another person or another two people.
[923.03s -> 931.37s]  But here's the stuff I got so we can go over it. Lots more money. I do want to do the high roller
[931.37s -> 937.51s]  stuff today. Very concerned about it, but I want to try it. Got this candy. Take a look at this.
[937.51s -> 948.65s]  I had that already, didn't I? I forgot to give this to Holly. No, whatever. Uh, I got this here.
[948.65s -> 952.95s]  This is pretty cool. I don't want to, I'm going to warm up a little bit. This is all my gear. Um,
[953.51s -> 958.82s]  I don't, there's nothing down here. Uh, this is just extra space. That's not, it's just,
[958.82s -> 966.33s]  I don't even have to look at it. It's, it's extra stuff. Um, we don't have to see it. Yeah. I,
[966.33s -> 972.98s]  I think I have enough money to be able to, uh, do some of that stuff. Try high roller with a group
[972.98s -> 982.39s]  that knows what they're doing. Can we, can we look at it? I, it's nothing, it is not,
[982.39s -> 991.16s]  we saw it. Okay. Um, I'm just going to go. Let's go. Wait, I don't want to, I don't want to bring
[991.16s -> 995.80s]  anything. I just want to like try to just get through. They did a, they actually changed the
[995.80s -> 1000.98s]  goblin caves. For those of you that don't know, goblin caves got a pretty big nerf in regards to
[1000.98s -> 1007.16s]  how hard it's been. Um, I believe that goblin HP and goblin attack power, pretty much the whole
[1007.16s -> 1013.96s]  thing was nerfed by like 10% across the board. They added another portal. So it used to be,
[1013.96s -> 1017.56s]  I think, what two or three and I think it's two now it's three. So now it's like, I don't,
[1017.56s -> 1024.44s]  I don't think it's, I think it's actually probably a little better. So they made it not as hard and
[1024.44s -> 1035.16s]  they added a portal. He's reading patch notes. Yeah. I like this game. They had to make it easier
[1035.16s -> 1041.26s]  because they felt bad for you. I think you're underestimating. No, I think you're overestimating
[1041.26s -> 1050.89s]  how much power I have playing this game. I don't, that's not accurate, but I'm going to hop in it.
[1050.89s -> 1073.02s]  I mean, I'm just going to go with no gear. Just go by the way, if you didn't know, stop that.
[1073.02s -> 1089.13s]  That was awful. Probably get one in before we get stirring here. I thought you're going to play
[1089.13s -> 1095.40s]  with Vinnie. Yeah. I'm like 15 minutes. We set six o'clock and I don't want to, you know,
[1095.40s -> 1107.22s]  I want to be like, okay, yeah, it's six. You guys ready? Why is it so loud? Why is it so loud?
[1107.22s -> 1134.63s]  It's still kind of loud. Is that better? That's better, right? A little too quiet. I'll do this
[1134.63s -> 1148.44s]  now. Oh, I, you know, this one doesn't count. What's my, why's my name so weird? What? Fighter
[1148.52s -> 1154.89s]  two? Oh, what is that? Oh, I have streamer mode turned on. I actually would prefer streamer mode
[1154.89s -> 1177.78s]  off. All right, let's try it again. That was, the game was really loud. I had to fix it. Good job,
[1177.78s -> 1199.42s]  streamer. My job to defend auto in every pregame. Sure you want to do high roller? I want to do high
[1199.42s -> 1205.58s]  roller with a group of three and a group of three that kind of plays and knows what they're doing.
[1205.58s -> 1213.38s]  It's a hundred bucks every time. All right, let's go. First real game of the night. By the way,
[1213.38s -> 1217.46s]  I'm going to be obsessed and I'll be, I'm going to be here pretty much all night. So those of you
[1217.46s -> 1229.99s]  that are like, oh, it's like 2 a.m. Jerma, it's, oh, I'm staying. We'll see. What? I was holding
[1229.99s -> 1234.97s]  right click. What happened? No, that's not right. That was weird. I was holding right click and it
[1234.97s -> 1265.18s]  didn't do anything. I swear to God, I held it because it didn't do it. Nice. All right, just
[1265.18s -> 1281.00s]  gotta, you gotta, I just gotta get in the swing of things. I already got that. Jerma, you've been
[1281.00s -> 1304.98s]  playing this game nonstop for two days. Please bathe. Oh, hey, dude, please bathe. I'm fine.
[1304.98s -> 1315.86s]  Oh, fuck off. Oh, also, by the way, hey, look what I'm doing. I am running with everything holstered
[1317.37s -> 1347.54s]  that you still caught up to me. Oh, God damn it. I'm, I'm dead. God damn it. Just leave me alone.
[1347.54s -> 1355.50s]  He's going to, it's not going to count like that. It's running into that guy. Okay. All right. I'm
[1355.50s -> 1358.79s]  fine. I'm fine. This one doesn't count. This is why you warm up. This is why I'm warming up. This is
[1358.79s -> 1367.14s]  warm-up shit. He opened the door and like the boss skeleton is there and he just follows me and kills
[1367.14s -> 1372.01s]  me. That's why I warm up. It's just, you know, just kill me. Kill me. Just do it. Just do it again.
[1372.01s -> 1381.53s]  I'm warming up. So you gotta do three warm-ups and that's it. I'm done. We're good. That was a shitty
[1381.53s -> 1400.17s]  start too. I hit right click. I didn't raise the shield. You gotta get over these first. There's
[1400.17s -> 1405.11s]  no such thing as a warm-up in this game. Well, there's enough for me to sit here and like kind
[1405.11s -> 1410.22s]  of every, you go through, everybody goes through that process. I don't care if you've played, you
[1410.22s -> 1423.14s]  know, Dark and Darker, League of Legends, Valorant, Apex, Overwatch. Your first two or three games
[1423.14s -> 1427.62s]  are usually just dog shit. And then you like, there you go. Then you're in. You're warmed up.
[1427.62s -> 1437.80s]  So check out how this one goes compared to the last two. Pretty bad spawn. This is a really bad
[1437.80s -> 1474.18s]  spawn. I kind of just get out of here. Yeah, I'm just getting out of here. Such a bad place to
[1474.18s -> 1482.92s]  fight this. All right. Something weird's happening. Sometimes. Okay. Did you just hear me click? It
[1482.92s -> 1488.60s]  didn't swing. What's going on here? This is actually weird. I swear to God. You had to have
[1488.60s -> 1507.58s]  heard the click. What is going on? I hope that's not a problem. What the fuck is going on? Hold on.
[1508.70s -> 1521.98s]  Yeah, I am like clicking and I am left clicking and right clicking and sometimes it's just not
[1521.98s -> 1531.37s]  happening. I was gonna, maybe should I restart the game? This wasn't happening yesterday.
[1545.02s -> 1575.67s]  Is anybody else having that problem? Or is this just weird right now? I was playing earlier and
[1575.67s -> 1595.26s]  it was swinging without me clicking. Maybe it's an internet thing. Maybe like the connection of the
[1595.26s -> 1604.71s]  game or something. As long as half of you believe this, then that's what matters, right? No, I'm like
[1604.71s -> 1635.51s]  serious. It actually is happening. It's not happening anymore. It happened a couple times
[1635.51s -> 1666.74s]  in a row that last game. Now we're in. Now we're in. Don't lose this one. Plus one weapon damage,
[1666.74s -> 1689.61s]  movement speed bonus, and it's a blue. This person wants to fight and that's okay. Here's

[1922.65s -> 1930.74s]  over who's going to pay the check. I'm telling you I got the check. Take it. My hand touched it first.
[1930.74s -> 1937.35s]  Yeah. All right. We got to get out of here alive though so you can get... You know, you can get
[1937.35s -> 1964.81s]  money for that. Yeah, good idea. Just get out of here. There it is. All right. There's our escape.

[2037.72s -> 2047.80s]  like, yeah, yeah. There's one up there. Did you see it? You doomed this guy. Oh, I thought he knew
[2047.80s -> 2054.42s]  how to get up. Oh, no. No, it's right there. It's right there. You'll be good. You have a potion or
[2054.42s -> 2078.79s]  anything. Oh, he's going to die. No. You did this. I thought it was like... Because he was like,
[2078.79s -> 2083.91s]  yeah, go in that one. I'm like, there's one up there. He saw it. I was like, should I... I was
[2083.91s -> 2091.74s]  trying to get him to go in. I was trying to get him to go in first. Oh, no. All right. Well,
[2093.83s -> 2107.51s]  okay. Oh, that was... Did I even have anything decent to leave? I did. I got the boots. We're
[2107.51s -> 2115.50s]  good. I got boots. I'm going to start a blue collection over here. I feel so bad. I thought
[2115.50s -> 2122.17s]  he knew his way out. It should have been me. Yeah, it should have been me. I should have just dropped
[2122.17s -> 2132.14s]  the boots for him and just died. Let's be real, though. That would have been pretty sick if he
[2132.14s -> 2151.78s]  had made that jump. Let me get people on a call here. Here we go. And start. I'm going to give
[2151.78s -> 2169.72s]  them a call. Hello. Hello. Hey, there. How are you doing? You've been playing Metroid? It's really
[2169.72s -> 2176.86s]  good. Is it good? Yeah, it's really good. That's good to hear. Is it like a remake? What is it?
[2177.66s -> 2182.94s]  It's like a remaster, like a really, really well done remaster. Have you ever played Metroid Prime?
[2182.94s -> 2193.62s]  No. Well, I love it. And it's really good. Is it motion controls? You could. I don't. You could
[2193.62s -> 2201.18s]  just do twin stick. Oh, okay. Yeah. So yeah, I'm enjoying it a lot. How are you, Jerma? I'm doing
[2201.18s -> 2207.35s]  great. Good to hear. Good to hear from you again. Yeah, you too. Did you watch the Nintendo Direct
[2207.35s -> 2214.25s]  or did you just hear about it like tangentially? I just heard about it. Okay. Is there any other
[2214.25s -> 2223.00s]  cool things? Yeah, there's a game where you play like as like a mouse and like you you like draw
[2223.00s -> 2229.38s]  other mouses and it's like you're like a wizard. I'm lying. No, Zelda. I was gonna say that sounds
[2229.38s -> 2240.57s]  like cool. Get him out of here. What? Hey, sir. Hey, am I not invited anymore? Am I? No, you're
[2240.57s -> 2246.66s]  uninvited. Okay. Okay. Well, then yeah, what are we laughing about? Oh, good one. Yeah, it wasn't
[2246.66s -> 2251.86s]  that I tried my best. But you know what? It was the Zelda trailer looks good, Jerma. So you you
[2251.86s -> 2256.58s]  know, when I play when I finish Breath of the Wild, I'm gonna be able to go right into the new one,
[2256.58s -> 2265.74s]  aren't I? Yeah, you're gonna have fun with it. That's pretty cool. I just I had a successful run.
[2265.74s -> 2272.55s]  Okay, I haven't installed the game. What's the what are we playing? No, sir. You guys wait for
[2272.55s -> 2281.69s]  me. Booking three head. We're playing Darkest Dungeon, right? Oh, I got that. Yeah, it's one
[2281.69s -> 2288.36s]  of the two dark games that are available for the steam next best dark and darker. I just want to
[2288.36s -> 2293.80s]  play it. I know they're gonna like take it offline. And they're gonna polish it up more. And
[2293.80s -> 2303.08s]  I want to play it. Why aren't you playing class? Are you germ? I just did fighter. Okay, I'll go
[2303.08s -> 2307.48s]  I'll use my wizard then. I have a lot of random classes. But the only one that actually has gear
[2307.48s -> 2316.60s]  or money is this fighter. Okay. Yeah, I leveled a fighter. I have some stuff on a wizard. But yeah,
[2318.23s -> 2322.55s]  if you want to invite me, my name is vines art like a wizard, but with Vine,
[2323.58s -> 2329.29s]  I couldn't think of a better name. My characters have like, like a little number one next to them.
[2329.29s -> 2343.03s]  I didn't even know what to do. Would you say German one? No, mead one. Okay, I'm v i n e z a r d.
[2343.03s -> 2354.18s]  There you are. All right, sir. What's your what's your name? I haven't made a character. What? What
[2354.18s -> 2360.07s]  should I be? You? I didn't you tell me you played this? Yeah, I think they wiped it like it was like
[2360.07s -> 2366.95s]  four betas ago. Oh, I told you I also told you I have no levels and no gear and no nothing.
[2366.95s -> 2371.11s]  That's fine. I didn't lie. But you just you know, video games. So you're gonna be you're gonna be
[2371.11s -> 2379.30s]  fine. I know. I know video games. Alright, so um, I'm a leveled up, Vinny, you have more experience
[2379.30s -> 2383.94s]  than I do in this. Do we like I would say we probably need like, we got a wizard, we have a
[2383.94s -> 2389.27s]  fighter. I mean, you could be I mean, cleric, you're leveled, you're leveled pretty nicely.
[2389.27s -> 2398.25s]  I would say I only played a lot last beta. Um, you know what ranger and cleric are two good choices.
[2398.25s -> 2404.74s]  I would say cleric is good for healing. But Rangers apparently really good with their like,
[2405.46s -> 2408.98s]  their arrows do a lot of DPS. So it's up to you, sir, whatever you like. And
[2410.52s -> 2418.86s]  rogues can rogues still go invisible or whatever they did before? They can. Okay, I think if you
[2418.86s -> 2423.74s]  played the first very first playtester, there's I think there's actually a lot of new things in
[2423.74s -> 2433.35s]  the game. I didn't play very much. I just played a little bit of cleric for like an hour. I have like
[2433.35s -> 2438.62s]  a couple things you probably could take just to have some stuff. I mean, you're not you're not
[2438.62s -> 2446.92s]  getting my blues. But you know, depending what you play. Do you need a green rapier? I have a
[2446.92s -> 2453.29s]  green spear. But I can't even use rapiers. You can. Yeah, fighter. Oh, wait, no, you can't.
[2453.29s -> 2462.84s]  Rogue can though. So I give it to you stir. I made a rogue. My name is creepo man. Okay. Wow.
[2462.84s -> 2472.84s]  Like they like this. I wrote it in discord. Capital C creepo man. I'm not in the lobby.
[2472.84s -> 2477.50s]  Enter the lobby. I'm entering the lobby. I'm in the lobby. There you are. All right, cool.
[2477.50s -> 2487.96s]  Sent invite sent. I am meed one. I can't sell this. This dude doesn't want to buy this stuff.
[2487.96s -> 2494.57s]  Cool. Fine. It's the collector that buys that shit. All right, so stir, I'll get you a weapon
[2494.57s -> 2499.61s]  from my stash. I feel like you shouldn't give me anything yet. Yeah, let's let's let's just do a
[2499.61s -> 2503.53s]  fuck face run. That's probably Yeah, take off all your good shit. Yeah, let's do a fucking fucking
[2503.53s -> 2508.09s]  raw dog my face on this one because I didn't play very much when I played and I only played
[2508.09s -> 2517.66s]  cleric and I kind of just healed. Why did you say it like that? Huh? I'll tell you what I have a
[2517.66s -> 2526.41s]  shitty rapier as well. I'll give you that one. Okay. Yeah, let's just go in without any. I mean,
[2526.41s -> 2531.46s]  he's gonna die. He's gonna die to the first skeleton and he's gonna uninstall the game.
[2531.46s -> 2537.62s]  Well, no, because I'm going to stand on a box. Are you guys right? Yeah, we're good. Do you like
[2537.62s -> 2542.98s]  do you like you you like played this? You know, how kind of how generally how it works? I think
[2542.98s -> 2547.30s]  it would honestly be in your best interest to assume that I don't. Okay. I wait. No,
[2547.30s -> 2553.06s]  I understand the gameplay. Everything outside of it, like equipment and selling. I don't that
[2553.06s -> 2559.27s]  doesn't make any sense to me. Okay, so but like basic information, like how do I like basic
[2559.27s -> 2563.70s]  information? I might have to read buying keys. I'm good, dude. You know, I'm a gamer. You're
[2563.70s -> 2568.02s]  gonna be good. You're gonna be good. Let's go. I believe in you, sir. Yeah, just a quick fuck
[2568.02s -> 2574.66s]  face run. Yeah, just like a dirty nasty. It doesn't even happen. Stank nasty. I got it.
[2574.66s -> 2581.26s]  If anything goes bad, I'll just crouch in a corner. You'll be fine. Okay, just already up though.
[2581.26s -> 2590.74s]  How? Okay, I got no stirs stirs stirs a gamer. You'll get it. Okay. I'm actually you've been
[2590.74s -> 2597.32s]  playing this a lot, huh? Like you got as addicted as I did. I I'm one of those people that I'm very
[2597.32s -> 2601.00s]  much already thinking that this is probably going to be the thing that I care about the most this
[2601.00s -> 2608.78s]  whole year. Yeah, I feel that I really like this game. Okay, they're there. I got to turn off the
[2608.78s -> 2613.90s]  voice chat because they're just saying voice isn't voice at the best part of the game.
[2615.82s -> 2622.12s]  It is until your Twitch channel gets banned. Oh, yeah, it is. When you're okay. Well, I'll get
[2622.12s -> 2628.01s]  banned. I'll take the L. All right, it can be fun. I got to hear what they're saying. I already did
[2628.01s -> 2633.13s]  a pre record of with voice chat on I was able to convince people not to kill me. I was like,
[2633.13s -> 2640.68s]  listen, dude, I'm a real person. Like I'm real. And they left me alone. I did a little RP. This
[2640.68s -> 2651.16s]  one here you can have that rapier. It's it's good. You might like it. I'm I'm in the options. Defend
[2651.16s -> 2656.20s]  me. Okay. All right. It's good because this is a very slow game. So like it's not like, dude,
[2656.20s -> 2661.62s]  we got to go come on the circles. Okay, the circles closing in. Yeah. In the meantime,
[2661.62s -> 2669.14s]  let's go look around. So hey, quick, quick TLDR stir everything. You should be picking up as
[2669.14s -> 2673.14s]  many of these little jewels as possible. It's like one of the ways to make money. You want to
[2673.14s -> 2679.83s]  collect everything. If it's like a little bracelet, a little jewel, a little goblet,
[2679.83s -> 2686.38s]  that's how you actually make money. And then we bring it back and it's a socialist society.
[2686.38s -> 2691.50s]  And we all share right? No, there's one guy that buys it all and runs the whole town.
[2691.58s -> 2708.06s]  What's the inventory tab? They didn't make it high. Do they not? Let me get this. There you go.
[2708.06s -> 2716.04s]  Yeah. Spider. Spider. All right. There's another spider. There's a pot over there somewhere.
[2716.04s -> 2722.50s]  Oh, my goodness gracious. Okay, we got I got a blue long sword. Watch out mead. I'm going to put
[2722.50s -> 2730.25s]  that on. Remember, you can throw a torch on the ground if you need extra light and don't want to
[2730.25s -> 2738.92s]  hold it. Okay. This thing's actually pretty awesome. I hope we make it out. Oh, skeleton.
[2740.58s -> 2749.03s]  Watch out. Magic looks awesome in this game. Oh, it seems unbelievable. You're not you're not
[2749.03s -> 2754.54s]  role playing. You're not like you don't say the spells when you cast them. Oh, should we? I can't
[2754.54s -> 2758.78s]  if you want me to. They gain more power the game. If you have voice chat on and you say magic missile,
[2758.78s -> 2766.55s]  it gets a can you can you is this better than you have stir the helmet on the leather cap? I don't
[2766.55s -> 2772.79s]  dude is I don't know what items are. Yeah, well, I think okay, Diablo. When you're running around
[2772.79s -> 2776.39s]  at level one in Diablo and every single thing you pick up on the ground is like, yeah, just replace
[2776.39s -> 2781.51s]  it. It's better. Okay, I heard you should go nude because then you get more move speed. I mean,
[2781.51s -> 2787.11s]  did you you could I don't know. I don't know if that's gonna work. But speaking of moving speed,
[2787.11s -> 2793.11s]  if you holster you do move faster. So keep that in mind. What's the most important x guys? Okay,
[2793.11s -> 2798.23s]  I okay, I need a moment to apologize because I'm going to be insufferable for like one or two games.
[2798.87s -> 2805.51s]  Just naked. Why are you just a naked guy in our party? Hey guys, dirty loot in there. I
[2805.51s -> 2810.63s]  can really use some pants. I am not a conjurer of cheap tricks. I just walked right out of a rust
[2810.63s -> 2819.61s]  server. You really do like you're like like rust. Oh, we got a skeleton here. I'm gonna die.
[2822.89s -> 2827.29s]  There is friendly firester and it's really bad. So just be aware. Okay. Yeah. Well,
[2827.29s -> 2831.05s]  you're the one who's taken the most damage. So I feel like you could use a little advice.
[2831.05s -> 2835.13s]  Stir better rapier here for you on the skeleton's corpse. Oh, yeah. And also,
[2835.13s -> 2841.08s]  Jeremiah. Yeah, there you go. If you guys want to give me 10 seconds to meditate so I can restore
[2841.08s -> 2847.56s]  my magic, that would be awesome. Also stir in the mini map. You notice that the white line
[2847.56s -> 2854.30s]  got to get in that line because you understand what happens. The it's like a br like victory
[2854.30s -> 2859.99s]  royale is within. I've never played one of those. What happens essentially when the thing with the
[2860.87s -> 2865.22s]  goes around the circle and if you're not in the other circle, watch out because you're going to
[2865.22s -> 2873.26s]  be taken tick damage. Yes, sir. Have you ever played a game called Fork Knife? So it's like
[2873.26s -> 2882.38s]  Hearthstone Battlegrounds. Is it normal that your game should stutter all the time? We haven't know,
[2882.38s -> 2885.42s]  but we have we have somebody over here. We don't know if they're friendly. It is just looks like
[2885.42s -> 2895.06s]  a single cleric saying yes. Okay. Hey, sir. Careful on the ground. Sometimes there's like,
[2895.54s -> 2901.86s]  uh, like spike traps like over here. Like do not step on this. Okay. And if there's a if then if
[2901.86s -> 2905.86s]  there's a trap in the wall, you're supposed to walk back and forth in front of it like three
[2905.86s -> 2911.86s]  or four times. Yeah, exactly. I know you make learn. Okay, I've learned a lot about this game,
[2911.86s -> 2916.26s]  but mostly only from Jeremiah. Everybody does that. It's not just me. Everybody does that.
[2916.26s -> 2922.02s]  Watch out. There's a this player down here. We don't know if they're friendly if they who cares.
[2922.02s -> 2926.10s]  Okay, so we got we have a little group here. Friend or foe, friend or foe. How are they?
[2926.10s -> 2930.98s]  Yeah, we're friendly everybody. If you can hear me. I have voice chat on so they can hear me,
[2930.98s -> 2941.74s]  but I can't hear them. So I can't get banned. Shit, I got hit by that. Hey, actually say make
[2941.74s -> 2946.58s]  sure you say like, hey, we're friendly until it counts in the end. We're friendly until it counts
[2946.58s -> 2953.62s]  in the end. I've been told to say you don't actually say that. Oh, I'm not going to attack
[2953.62s -> 2957.22s]  you. I'm not going to attack. Don't know if you're going to have a cleric. It's cool to have cleric.
[2959.24s -> 2964.28s]  Why did you hit him? No, now they're going to. No, it was an accident. He's new. He's new.
[2966.84s -> 2973.83s]  We really we don't want to. You're cool. It's fine until it counts in the end. We're not going to
[2973.83s -> 2983.14s]  kill you. Hey, can you heal? Can you heal our like goofy ass friend people on the other side
[2983.14s -> 2991.13s]  of the store? There's a you disabled input, but not output as a chat member. Is that you?
[2991.93s -> 2995.45s]  No, there's someone behind the door. They're throwing fireballs. They're getting real. All
[2995.45s -> 3002.58s]  right. Let's let's fuck them up. Oh, I'm just taking damage. That's awesome. Oh, no. Oh,

[3019.67s -> 3021.91s]  I have a campfire here if we if we needed to heal up.
[3022.31s -> 3028.95s]  You're killing the person. What are you doing? Oh, my God. No, he's the worst. He's the worst.
[3029.91s -> 3033.11s]  We got to get him out of the fucking game. He's already a fucking problem. He's already.
[3034.07s -> 3045.03s]  He's a massive problem already. He had a lot of shit on him. Okay. Hang on. Hang on. Good.
[3045.03s -> 3056.46s]  Wow. I went to the trap. He bounced me into the trap. Oops. This is such a bad place to fight to
[3056.46s -> 3065.43s]  try to like. Yeah, it's a really bad place. Oh, shit. So he's going to me. That one. You got him.

[3070.71s -> 3074.71s]  I don't know if there's another guy that might have been there is there is one guy. He looks
[3074.71s -> 3079.59s]  like a wizard. I can't believe I'm looting the person. This is unbelievable. And look,
[3079.59s -> 3087.03s]  this is a nice bowl of shit. That's my kill. Are you seriously looting him right now? You got naked.
[3087.03s -> 3092.07s]  I got the kill and you're looting it. I dropped the bow on the ground. It's a blue bow. Yeah,
[3092.07s -> 3097.19s]  let's do it. All right. Come follow me. I think we're going to get the safety. Did you get the bow?
[3097.91s -> 3106.74s]  Yeah, that doesn't seem good. There's a whole other party over here. Oh, shit. Okay. I don't
[3106.74s -> 3110.10s]  know if I can. It's going to take a while to full heel and we got the circle closing in.
[3110.74s -> 3116.18s]  Yeah, let's get in the circle. All right. We try to get out of here. The portals are opening.
[3116.18s -> 3123.06s]  We start to find some skeleton. Okay, a creepo man like come over to us. Well, there's another
[3123.06s -> 3128.26s]  exit. Why don't we take the other exit and avoid the combat? Good. We got to get into the circle.
[3128.26s -> 3132.98s]  Yeah, it goes into a circle as well. So come up. Yes, let's get there. We missed a bunch of treasure
[3132.98s -> 3138.82s]  too, but that's okay. Beware of traps. This is a this is a trial run for stir. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3138.82s -> 3144.82s]  Exactly. I cannot believe that person is probably so pissed because it was like, oh, yeah, we're
[3144.82s -> 3160.06s]  playing it. Oh, there's people here. You any hits? Uh, not really. Oh, fuck. Big, big cast here.
[3160.06s -> 3167.61s]  I think I might be able to. Yeah, they're gonna shoot down the hole. We might be able to ambush
[3167.61s -> 3175.96s]  here if we pull back. Stir, are you dead? I exit it. What? What? You got out? Yeah. Wait,
[3177.24s -> 3185.27s]  where? Where? Where did you go? In the room we were in, there was an exit and he had nothing.
[3185.35s -> 3191.69s]  Sorry, I took it. Friendly. We're friendly. Oh, my God. There's they're there. They're right
[3191.69s -> 3197.34s]  behind us. They're behind us. Okay. Okay. Yeah. All right. Close the door. Close the door.
[3197.34s -> 3202.46s]  Vinny, did you take it? I got nothing. I got nothing. All right. Be well. All right. I'm
[3202.46s -> 3209.74s]  gonna do my best. I just need to figure this out. Be well. Wait, what? Wait, wait. Your wizard is
[3209.74s -> 3217.42s]  low HP. You the fighter, valiant, noble fighter, just left the wizard with no HP. Well, here's
[3217.42s -> 3223.50s]  the thing. So let me explain. Let me explain how this game works. Stir. Okay. I have I found a
[3223.50s -> 3228.71s]  blue sword, which is like really good for my class. It's I mean, it's like that's a big deal.
[3228.71s -> 3233.91s]  There's no trading unless you you have to like pay or like bring it and drop it. Hey, can you
[3233.91s -> 3237.43s]  hear me? You want to share the campfire? It's gonna be cool. All right. Never mind. I'm dead.
[3241.16s -> 3249.99s]  It's so awful. Chad, are you sure that my output? Can you guys hear me in game? Germ? I have voice
[3249.99s -> 3256.39s]  chat turned off. I had I was off by default. I'll turn it on and I can. I had an issue
[3256.39s -> 3261.64s]  a couple nights ago where I had a kind of, you know, somebody, an incident, somebody said
[3261.64s -> 3266.97s]  something and it's like, okay, well, now we fucking have to turn it off. Yeah, that's 100%. So I turned
[3266.97s -> 3275.67s]  it off. But yeah, I check. So the game's pretty easy, huh? But here's the thing, stir, what you
[3275.67s -> 3280.57s]  did was not necessarily wrong because you got a blue bow. But the problem is, so you could like
[3280.57s -> 3287.45s]  just stash that. The stash is not shared. So it's not like, oh, I'm going to make a ranger and just
[3287.45s -> 3293.13s]  go to my shared stash. That's not in the game. So if you want to put that on a ranger, you're going
[3293.13s -> 3297.85s]  to have to like give that to one of us and we have to get out and then give it to your ranger or
[3298.49s -> 3301.93s]  trade it on the market. There's a trading market where you can trade with other people.
[3301.93s -> 3305.93s]  But it costs, what, 15 gold to do it. You're giving stir an ethics lesson.
[3308.17s -> 3318.98s]  Okay, so I got nothing and I can only sell my bow. What should I name this rogue,
[3318.98s -> 3329.02s]  this archer chat? I don't know. Sneaky archer. That's a pretty good name. God, it's not available.
[3329.02s -> 3334.60s]  Skyrim, you want me to call him Skyrim? Okay, I have a game mechanics question, teacher.
[3335.48s -> 3344.63s]  Why are there 12 merchants? Because you sell different things per merchant.
[3344.63s -> 3354.38s]  Okay. Yeah. So for instance, the collector, the collector wants to take like gems, jewels, bangles,
[3355.10s -> 3361.99s]  chalices. That's who you sell all that to. And I know you, I know, let me, I just want it in one
[3361.99s -> 3366.95s]  spot. I just want to hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Sometimes stir, you got to slow down and enjoy
[3366.95s -> 3378.31s]  the lore. Okay. Okay. So the collector, you can sell those little- Who would I sell the bow to?
[3378.31s -> 3384.92s]  We're looking at the weaponsmith or the armor. Okay. Selling that bow, I mean, but maybe if you
[3384.92s -> 3391.30s]  do have a ranger. I'll take it. Yeah. I just made a ranger. Do you want the bow? You can sell it
[3391.30s -> 3398.90s]  if you want. I mean, honestly, I escaped on my first game. I got a kill and I didn't even have
[3398.90s -> 3405.48s]  any clothes on, so I don't even think I need the bow. I can give it to you. Yeah, just bring it in
[3405.48s -> 3409.48s]  the mission, then drop it on the ground. I'll take it. Okay. Because I just made a ranger. I want to,
[3410.04s -> 3415.88s]  I feel like my wizard, I was just getting no, no attacks on enemies, really. I can't believe you
[3415.88s -> 3423.74s]  killed that. That person was being so nice to us too. I know everybody's saying, hey, dude,
[3423.74s -> 3430.52s]  you should buy the thing for the gold stash, right? But I'm, I'm a weirdo and I want to like
[3430.52s -> 3437.18s]  fill half the stash with this because I like the way it looks. That's saying I killed at least two
[3437.18s -> 3443.69s]  people. I think, no, I think, I think you, you were part of at least, I mean, the two kills that we got
[3443.69s -> 3450.95s]  in that hallway. Okay. All right. Yeah. I might go back to wizard then. I'll try ranger for a little
[3450.95s -> 3457.34s]  bit, but then I'll go to, I'll go to wizard. How do you level up? Because I'm noticing I'm still
[3457.34s -> 3465.37s]  level one and I feel like I shouldn't be. You just got to kill more rats and creatures and skeletons
[3465.37s -> 3471.21s]  and players. It takes a little bit. I mean, all honestly, all leveling up does is I, I feel like
[3471.21s -> 3477.43s]  a level 15. Okay. So when you level, look, the game is still making stuff. So if you go to honestly,
[3477.51s -> 3482.95s]  you should do this right now. I'm just babbling random words and you took it as they're still
[3482.95s -> 3490.02s]  making the game, but hold on, go, go, go up to the top, go to class. You see the, go to perk and skill.
[3490.02s -> 3495.54s]  Yeah. You have some perks that you, you unlock perk slots essentially is when you, how you
[3495.54s -> 3501.85s]  every five levels. Okay. I was just, well, I was asking this how specifically I was just killed
[3501.85s -> 3505.93s]  nerds. Yeah. Just kill me, just kill people. You know, you're saying it was a good thing. I killed
[3505.93s -> 3512.63s]  that guy now. Now you're flipping again. There might be something in that perk listed. You would
[3512.63s -> 3522.58s]  rather have is what I'm saying. So look, so is this what it's usually like with you guys? Yeah.
[3523.66s -> 3537.24s]  Yeah. Yeah. It's been like this for 10 years, man. 10 years. I'm, I'm, hi, I'm Vinny by the way,
[3537.24s -> 3542.36s]  star. Nice to meet you. Yeah. I think I'd like Vinny. I think he's like Vinny. Yeah. Yeah. You seem
[3542.36s -> 3546.73s]  nice. Thanks man. Appreciate it. No, we were, we were, we were dark tide friends for a while. Come
[3546.73s -> 3555.94s]  on. Yeah. Yeah. No, me and Jerma, we, we hunt ghosts usually, or we, we hit people with swords.
[3555.94s -> 3562.94s]  That seems to be like the two extremes of our gameplay. Me and Jerma argue. Okay. Hold on. I
[3562.94s -> 3567.99s]  have to show this. I have to show this on stream. This is so stupid. Hold on. While you look at your
[3567.99s -> 3577.34s]  perks, I just need to show this on stream. This is so stupid. What is it? It's, it's just a dumb
[3577.34s -> 3599.74s]  picture. Oh, man. That's, that's funny. I like it. Yeah. That's a good one. Didn't take them that
[3599.74s -> 3608.92s]  long. Huh? No, not at all. That was a good one though. All right. Are we, are we good to go? Yeah.
[3608.92s -> 3614.68s]  I think, uh, I'm ready. So we just get a stir. You need to ready up when you're, uh, one second.
[3614.68s -> 3624.18s]  Okay. Sorry. I'm, I'm comprehending. All right. This is a really good sword. Actually I killed
[3624.18s -> 3631.82s]  that guy in two hits. I'm not taking it. I'm going to leave it. I don't have the picture. Jerma had
[3631.82s -> 3638.07s]  the picture. You want me to capture his stream so I could show you the image? Yeah. He didn't show
[3638.07s -> 3644.84s]  it to me. So here I have it. It was posted in chat. I'll show you. I feel like it wasn't meant
[3644.84s -> 3654.42s]  for me. I'm ready. Okay. All right. Will you put clothes on? Oh, wait, you, you got out. So you
[3654.42s -> 3661.00s]  don't have any, you throw it off. Okay. Let's just go. I was wondering why, cause like you're naked
[3661.00s -> 3674.86s]  and that's what that, okay. I get it. I like the lobbies go so fucking fast. I mean, you're there
[3674.86s -> 3679.99s]  five seconds. Someone punches you in the back of the head and then you just start. It's, it's
[3679.99s -> 3683.67s]  good in a play test environment though, because there are like 50,000 people playing this game
[3683.67s -> 3688.57s]  right now concurrently. I can't believe how big this game blew up. Cause like when I was playing
[3688.57s -> 3693.83s]  it for December's tests, that was the first time I had even heard of it. And then it just like
[3693.83s -> 3699.51s]  quadrupled and then like times 10, the amount of users. Yeah. The first beta was, was kind of a
[3699.51s -> 3704.39s]  long wait time, but I think, I think everybody kind of was waiting. Like after that December test,
[3704.47s -> 3707.69s]  I remember hearing about it and going, Whoa, that looks kind of interesting.
[3707.69s -> 3710.57s]  And then it was like, wait, it's actually coming for the steam demo thing. Oh,
[3710.57s -> 3717.00s]  fuck. Yeah. I think everybody had the same idea. Yeah. I was really addicted to this. It was like
[3717.56s -> 3724.92s]  four hours. Hey creepo man. Yes. Oh, take orders from your master. What do you need from a creepo?
[3724.92s -> 3729.10s]  I need you to, you hold, if you hold a torch, it increases the, you know what? Just get in here.
[3729.10s -> 3733.10s]  It's easier to creep in the dark. I'm pretty sure creepo man was a stone temple pilot song.
[3735.58s -> 3743.10s]  All right, chat. Uh, we get some pants. What was that thing that you posted about some
[3743.10s -> 3748.15s]  songs that like people said didn't exist or something. Oh, uh, I was streaming
[3748.15s -> 3753.96s]  corruptions the other night and I was playing GTA San Andreas and people were all like stretchy.
[3753.96s -> 3758.36s]  I was like, they look like rubber bands. And in San Andreas, there's a stone temple pilot song.
[3758.36s -> 3763.42s]  So I was like, that's a, that's a song from back in the day. They had a song called rubber band man.
[3763.42s -> 3769.93s]  It's like rubber band, rubber band man. Um, and people were like, no, it's not real then.
[3769.93s -> 3776.39s]  That's not a real song. And then I found it on an old tape. So when I was a kid, I honestly thought
[3776.39s -> 3781.45s]  that was a bit from you. I thought it was you singing. Oh, I was like, oh, this is like really
[3781.45s -> 3784.89s]  funny of him. Like he made this like rubber band song. Like, and he's saying it's a stone
[3784.89s -> 3793.24s]  temple pilot song. Yeah. But it's a real song. That's funny. Yeah. It's real. Yeah. We are doing
[3793.24s -> 3799.05s]  like, by the way, we've lost creepo man. I'm in the darkness. Hey, star, where are you? I'm in the
[3799.05s -> 3805.42s]  dark. Oh, he's back here. Okay. There's helicopters in this room. I feel like we should catch up with
[3805.50s -> 3811.50s]  star. Can I make the plants versus zombies VOD permanent? It already is on the archive channel.
[3811.50s -> 3825.29s]  Come on, Gwen. Oh, all right. You got that bug. That's good. All right. Uh, you see any treasure
[3825.29s -> 3830.49s]  in here? Yeah. Open up every chest stir because sometimes it just be something in there. You just
[3830.49s -> 3834.65s]  take everything. I feel like it's a waste of time because you guys are already doing it. I feel like
[3834.65s -> 3840.57s]  as a team, we should also have different roles. Can you one guy's the looter, one guy's the torch
[3840.57s -> 3848.71s]  guy? You know what? Um, these pots are also good. There's sometimes really good stuff and potions
[3848.71s -> 3862.02s]  in them. There's not be down here. Watch out. We got says, um, I love how you've, uh, you stir.
[3862.02s -> 3868.92s]  You've committed to being like the comic relief today. Comic. I'm taking this really seriously.
[3868.92s -> 3874.97s]  I have just like naked running around, like killing our friends, the naked vagrant. You
[3874.97s -> 3878.97s]  guys said you were going to kill him when it mattered at the end and it mattered to me.
[3878.97s -> 3886.52s]  Shit. We, that's right. That was said out loud. I'm at my fault. I feel like I'm getting,
[3886.52s -> 3893.56s]  I'm catching a lot of flack back here. I said I'm, I'm calm to that. Here. I'll be torched guy.
[3896.01s -> 3901.88s]  Get them. Do you guys see him? Do you guys see him? Do you see him?
[3905.98s -> 3910.38s]  All right. You can just punch him. It's kind of dark in here. Oh, we've only had a,
[3910.46s -> 3919.37s]  I've only had a creep with a light. How do you throw the torch? Uh, right click,
[3919.37s -> 3923.53s]  but you only have three of them. So should we go this way or should we? I feel like we might get
[3923.53s -> 3926.97s]  stuck down here. Uh, there's a helicopter down here. I'll let, I'll let you lead germ. Oh,
[3926.97s -> 3931.21s]  they have the, we can get the best. They got the best loot because the dragon flies wear jewelry.
[3934.22s -> 3939.45s]  Hey, Chad, how do you shoot three hour arrows at a time with the bow? Does anyone know?
[3939.45s -> 3945.05s]  I think it's a, it's a skill. Okay. You got to go have that in the skill menu.
[3945.05s -> 3961.38s]  It's a skill you didn't choose. Oh, there you go. When is GTA six coming out? Um, I think like,
[3961.38s -> 3967.43s]  probably, I don't know, like two years maybe. Hey, sir. Yeah. Uh, can you, can you wear that,
[3967.43s -> 3975.00s]  that outfit? Where? Right here. Okay. And I would definitely put it on. Circle's coming.
[3980.73s -> 3984.81s]  We got some problems here. This water looks scrumptious. It kind of does.
[3984.81s -> 3991.42s]  Looks like ecto cooler. Yeah, it is very green. It's green, but it's very like transparently
[3991.42s -> 3997.98s]  green. So it's just like that. Hey, hey, German men, this zombie is wearing some sick pants, dude.
[3997.98s -> 4002.14s]  You definitely don't have pants better than that. It's Nyquil. Yeah, I guess you could boil some
[4002.14s -> 4014.33s]  chicken in this. Right. This Zambi, dude, you got to check this Zambi. This Nyquil chicken.
[4014.33s -> 4025.64s]  Oh, blue. Plate pants. If you need them. What do I even have in my pants right now?
[4027.69s -> 4038.71s]  Is this water or jello? Like lime jello. Something in between. I have plate boots.
[4038.71s -> 4046.50s]  Want to double it. Want any armor? Okay. Yeah, one of those zombies had plate leggings.
[4046.50s -> 4049.78s]  Oh, leggings. Actually, yeah, actually, I probably could use those. Let me go back there.
[4052.22s -> 4056.06s]  Slapping around. I mean, I love the sound in this game that I was telling, like,
[4056.06s -> 4059.96s]  I was playing with my mods the other day, and it's like half of the sound effects in this game
[4059.96s -> 4067.50s]  are just feet slapping on like wet concrete or like dry concrete. The penguin walk.
[4067.50s -> 4071.90s]  Just penguins walking. Just sounds like penguins walking around. Yeah, I guess it does. It's like,
[4075.98s -> 4082.89s]  now my chat wants to drink the green water. They really want it. I missed. Let's see.
[4084.46s -> 4091.88s]  Heavy gauntlet green would be good for you. It is. Thank you. How does, uh, how's healing
[4091.88s -> 4100.15s]  working in this? It is red potions, a cleric, or, um, you have bandages or skills.
[4101.19s -> 4104.47s]  I have some extra bandages there if you want to come grab them off me.
[4104.47s -> 4116.79s]  Yeah. I just fell back in the water. Great. Okay. Uh, oh, hey, Vinny. Yep. On the ground.
[4116.79s -> 4125.29s]  Oh, nice. Oh, awesome. Thank you. Uh, hey, creepo man, if you're asked about health,
[4125.29s -> 4129.53s]  sometimes there's random shrines that just do different things. This one is a full heel.
[4129.53s -> 4136.34s]  Interesting. Yeah. You might, you might want that. I'm praying to my God. Nice. It was an awesome
[4136.34s -> 4144.62s]  God. Whoever it is. I'm sure they're awesome. The dark lord bathroom. Uh, portals have started to
[4144.62s -> 4150.09s]  spawn and sir, you were asking, like you were asking randomly, like what the fuck's going on?
[4150.82s -> 4155.38s]  Only one person can go in a portal and they spawn randomly in the area. So it's just kind of a mess
[4155.38s -> 4159.86s]  to try to find one eventually. And there's only, there are not enough portals for everybody to get
[4159.86s -> 4164.25s]  out. Indeed. Yeah. And if it's a red portal, that'll take you to the next floor, which is
[4164.25s -> 4168.73s]  way more difficult. So maybe you don't take those right away people. Hello there travelers. We are
[4168.73s -> 4173.37s]  friendly. We have my head, which would take for you. No, you do not want to attack. Oh, they want
[4173.37s -> 4181.08s]  to go. They want to go. They want to go. I would recommend against it. We are heavily armed. I'm
[4181.08s -> 4196.20s]  dead. Come on. Creepo man. It's up to you now. Creepo man. You, you gotta, I have, I have actually
[4196.20s -> 4201.16s]  a lot of stuff. Yeah. You were at this point right now, sir, just try to find a blue portal and do
[4201.16s -> 4207.99s]  not engage anybody and closed doors behind you too. That's a good strategy. Yeah. Your goal is
[4207.99s -> 4213.27s]  to go through that room. Yeah. Just, just, just try to find a blue portal as the only goal you have
[4213.27s -> 4226.07s]  and do not engage and just hide and sneak around. Oh, I'm a gamer. We'll see. Chad, are you sure
[4226.07s -> 4230.50s]  they can hear me with my audio settings as they are right now? I don't think I could hear you in
[4230.50s -> 4235.06s]  game, but I kind of walked away. So I don't know. That's so funny. We kind of just, if they couldn't
[4235.06s -> 4238.02s]  hear you, we were just kind of seeing how they reacted. We just kind of was standing there and
[4238.02s -> 4243.50s]  I got hit in the head with an arrow. Yeah, basically it's like, oh, these, these three,
[4243.50s -> 4253.38s]  these three guys just stand still free headshot. Oh my God. Creepo man. What?
[4256.18s -> 4263.98s]  That's an escape portal, my friend. Yep. Blue portals where cross the way on that right there,
[4263.98s -> 4267.98s]  right next to you. That one, that blue one, you just have to activate it. It takes about 10
[4267.98s -> 4274.10s]  seconds to activate and anybody can walk through it. I can't believe you're going to make it, dude.
[4274.10s -> 4283.64s]  Creepo man. You're going to make it. You're going to make it. Nice creeped on. Nice work. So now
[4284.28s -> 4288.76s]  you go to your, you know, your stash and this is where you make the decision on,
[4288.76s -> 4295.08s]  Hey bro, do I want to bring something with me next time? Or do you stash it to make sure you can keep
[4295.08s -> 4301.94s]  it? Are you just, you're selling all your chalices and bangles? That's the, they have no other purpose
[4301.94s -> 4308.52s]  to the collector collector collector. And then, can you hear me in game right now? You hear an
[4308.52s -> 4312.52s]  echo? Yes, I do. Sick. Okay. So yeah, those dudes heard us and then they killed us.
[4314.04s -> 4322.55s]  Yeah. I heard you guys talk to them and I walked away. Oh, okay. Um, I'm sorry. I have,
[4322.55s -> 4333.14s]  I have a ethical question. I have a purple, I like an epic chest that you could wear right now.
[4333.14s -> 4339.22s]  Me? No, Vinny. I have, it's for a ranger. It's literally purple and it's okay. Oh, was I supposed
[4339.22s -> 4346.42s]  to drop you that bow? I had it the whole time. Oh yeah. But the reason why it's unethical and I
[4346.42s -> 4350.02s]  don't care if you lose it or if you die with it. It's just because I may have accidentally
[4350.02s -> 4356.41s]  BM stole this from somebody. What do you mean you stole it from someone? How? Like in game or what?
[4356.41s -> 4362.41s]  We fought a monster and like it was a solo game and it was a bunch of chaos everywhere and people
[4362.41s -> 4367.29s]  were fighting and dying. And I just, we killed this boss thing and then there's like three or
[4367.29s -> 4372.82s]  four other people started attacking each other. And I just grabbed everything and ran in a portal.
[4372.82s -> 4377.30s]  No, that's fine. Oh, that's why they make these games. I don't think that's an ethical quandary.
[4377.30s -> 4387.75s]  I think that's real. Wait, wait, wait. Bandages are 45 gold. Not what happened. Isn't that a rip
[4387.75s -> 4398.38s]  off? That stir. Welcome to dark and darker. It's fucking fabric. Well stir, that's a pack of three.
[4398.38s -> 4403.74s]  Also don't ever buy the expensive one. Buy the one that's 10. It's 15 gold. Oh, I didn't see that
[4403.74s -> 4410.52s]  they were different. That's for like rich Andes that have like thousands of gold. I got like 35
[4410.52s -> 4419.24s]  gold that run. Is that is that better than your second run? I don't know. I was also alone. Okay,
[4419.24s -> 4425.96s]  me too. In the end, we're all alone. All right, you guys. Yeah, I'm ready. That's right. As for
[4425.96s -> 4431.48s]  that. Yeah, you can hold on to that for if you play an archer. I don't think I deserve that.
[4431.48s -> 4437.35s]  I'll die. What's the question stir? Well, I have it in the menu item to purchase bandage.
[4437.35s -> 4442.71s]  How do I actually buy it? Okay, so you're going to click it and you can say fill in all stash
[4442.71s -> 4447.27s]  because that's like hey, I have the money wherever and just send this a make deal. Oh, I thought that
[4447.27s -> 4455.64s]  meant like fill my whole stash with as many of these as I can possibly buy. And how do you
[4455.64s -> 4462.14s]  know between your torch and your bandage? Oh, three and four. You're like item slots. You can
[4462.14s -> 4471.11s]  switch between them. You just cycle. You have. Yeah, you have three slots per. Okay, I knew chat
[4471.11s -> 4477.37s]  was gonna say fill my hole after stir said that I knew it. I'm gonna knock. I'm only gonna bring
[4477.37s -> 4481.45s]  a couple bandages. We're still kind of still learning. Well, some of us are, but you know,
[4481.45s -> 4489.82s]  whatever. Oh, stir, by the way, come look at the dog. Look at the dog's name. I saw on your stream.
[4489.82s -> 4498.20s]  I did watch quite a bit auto. That's man. It's weird. They'd name it like a cat that but close.
[4498.20s -> 4505.67s]  Yeah, I heard about that. Do you think that's a reference? I'm probably gonna say no. I kind
[4505.67s -> 4511.11s]  of feel like it might be. I mean, it's autos pretty famous at this point. He's a pretty he's a pretty
[4511.11s -> 4517.83s]  well known dog. Yeah, but auto is like just a cool name. I think so. I thought you'd I actually
[4517.83s -> 4523.61s]  thought it's a dog, right? Dog auto. Yes, because you said cat a second ago. That's the in game.
[4523.61s -> 4532.81s]  Sorry. Well, the in the game is a cat. He has a dog is I thought it was a UTO like automobile like
[4532.81s -> 4541.46s]  a car at one point. Yeah. Oh, sir. You got that bow. Oh, yeah. Hold on skeleton. All right, let's
[4541.46s -> 4545.14s]  get the skeleton dropping the bow down here in the light. Check this out. Check out and check this
[4545.14s -> 4555.50s]  out. Check out this really nice. Thank you. I don't think there are charged. I don't think so. But
[4555.50s -> 4561.66s]  you do get combos when you continue attacking and the combos are good. Sword here. I'm sorry. I'm
[4561.66s -> 4568.98s]  still asking questions. No, no. Push to talk. I think it's B but I rebound it. So I don't know.
[4568.98s -> 4577.16s]  Pretty sure it's B. It is B. That's weird. Now ask as many questions you want because this game
[4577.72s -> 4582.55s]  is kind of like like what the hell is happening? I don't know what's going on. And I think a lot
[4582.55s -> 4586.87s]  of people maybe open this game and play for like 20 minutes and go, this is stupid. And they did
[4586.87s -> 4591.61s]  kind of it's like it's almost like, oh, shit. Wait. Okay. I almost like when you first I remember
[4591.61s -> 4596.23s]  when I first played Dark Souls, and I remember just running around in circles, not understanding
[4596.23s -> 4604.14s]  anything behind us. There's a group behind us in the door where we started. Yeah, creepos going
[4604.14s -> 4610.15s]  in the hole. Wait in the hole. Oh, they're here. Oh, they're behind us in this store. All right.
[4610.15s -> 4616.25s]  What do you guys want to go hole or creepo strategy and just like, yeah, yeah, why we could
[4616.25s -> 4633.05s]  put your torches down? Oh, yeah. This is like, like, Tarkov is one of those games that I just
[4633.05s -> 4637.90s]  it just didn't click with me. Yeah. And this is very similar to Tarkov, but I feel a little bit
[4637.90s -> 4644.23s]  more user friendly to start. Also, Dark Souls, they're coming through that door. I'm still back
[4644.23s -> 4652.63s]  here. They come through. Okay, they might be engaging. I don't know. I think I think we'll
[4652.63s -> 4656.47s]  come back here. Let's fight them. And also, but don't come back here because I threw caltrops in
[4656.47s -> 4662.95s]  front of the door. We will lose. We will lose. Okay. It was like one. It was like one ranger.
[4662.95s -> 4671.00s]  Maybe. Yeah. Games like this because I reason why I'm saying ask as many questions as you want.
[4671.00s -> 4675.32s]  I played this for like 30 minutes, 40 minutes, and I was like, this is the worst game I've ever
[4675.32s -> 4681.82s]  played. I was like, this is probably the worst game I've ever played. And it took me like an
[4681.82s -> 4686.31s]  hour or two to be like, wait, this actually is like one of the most fun things I've ever done.
[4686.31s -> 4690.58s]  Yeah, really. This clicks where Tarkov didn't for me, which is weird because you know what
[4690.58s -> 4696.18s]  Bloodborne clicked for me 100%. But Dark Souls never did. And I've gone back to Dark Souls like
[4696.18s -> 4701.59s]  three times and I still have not. I just have no desire to return to it. But I love Elden Ring,
[4701.59s -> 4707.19s]  completed it like fully loved Sekiro, loved Bloodborne. I tried Dark Souls just didn't,
[4707.19s -> 4711.19s]  it was just too much for me. And I'm getting shit from that. I'm getting shit for that from my chat
[4711.19s -> 4720.50s]  from people who know that story already. God damn it. Okay, no, I am confused how I take out the
[4720.50s -> 4727.70s]  bandages. Like no button. They're all on one of your slots. Oh, I see. Okay, I got it. Yeah.
[4727.70s -> 4733.35s]  And it takes about 10 seconds. Hold. It's not very much but it's enough to kind of. I think I'm rogue
[4733.35s -> 4739.82s]  so I get like the super action speed. Yeah, that would be resourcefulness. It's a stat. It's an
[4739.82s -> 4744.95s]  insanely important stat eventually here because it just lets you do things so quickly. Some classes
[4744.95s -> 4749.43s]  have awful resourcefulness. Cleric is like one of the slowest in the whole game, right?
[4752.01s -> 4756.98s]  But Star, you are going to inevitably take more damage if you're naked. Yeah, but I'm not going
[4756.98s -> 4763.82s]  to take any because I'm going to be evasive. You know, I know that I had a dodge. Okay. Yeah,
[4763.82s -> 4770.28s]  getting getting over the initial hump of I don't get it. I died to the first skeleton and like I
[4770.28s -> 4775.88s]  don't get it. It is if you can get over it and like try to understand it, then it's like, oh,
[4775.88s -> 4780.44s]  wow, this is actually really fun, which goes for most things, right? But yeah, yeah, you have to
[4780.44s -> 4785.08s]  give it the time. I guess you do have to. Yeah, this one deserves the time because it's it's
[4785.08s -> 4792.12s]  rewarding. It's really worth it. But also, sir, if you want to know red, like a red skeleton or
[4792.12s -> 4799.21s]  like a red spider is a elite, which means there is obviously elite and they hurt and but they
[4799.21s -> 4809.24s]  have more stuff. There's also another mode that I would like to try at some point tonight. It's
[4809.24s -> 4816.44s]  called high roller and we have to pay 100 gold to go in, but it's much harder and much more better
[4816.44s -> 4821.35s]  stuff drops. I'll tell you when you when you end up playing with like Kraken or whoever,
[4821.35s -> 4824.31s]  yeah, you could do that one because I have zero I have no money on this character.
[4825.56s -> 4834.01s]  But that sounds that sounds like butt clenching. Yep. Is there any way to tell if a chest is a
[4834.01s -> 4840.47s]  mimic? I don't know. You just kind of have to find out. But you you have enough time to run from the
[4840.47s -> 4857.06s]  mimic. That's the one saving grace. Maybe if you hit it. Oh, big, big door, big, big scary door.
[4857.06s -> 4862.36s]  It is a big scary door. That means there's a big thing in there. Yeah. In there, there's like a
[4862.36s -> 4867.86s]  wizard or a champion or something. I'm not mistaken. And also, we're as we get closer here,
[4867.86s -> 4872.52s]  tons of people are going to be kind of collapsing on these rooms and we could just get just dumped
[4872.52s -> 4881.72s]  on. Yeah, I'm I'm decent shield here for you, Jerma. Oh, I just found a skeleton. Oh, buckler
[4881.72s -> 4890.73s]  or I'll take it. But yeah, I got the one I have more defense. You guys want to go in the omega
[4890.73s -> 4896.06s]  door or do you want to leave it alone? Let's get the skeleton first so we don't get ganged up on
[4896.06s -> 4905.10s]  by skeletons. All right. I closed the door. There's a lot. There was a lot of skeletons by the door.
[4905.10s -> 4909.72s]  Yeah, we could probably kill them. Let's go close the doors behind us. Make sure you know.
[4909.72s -> 4914.84s]  Well, there's skeletons up here, too. We can systematically kind of like go from up to down
[4914.84s -> 4921.94s]  and I can like snipe some skeletons that we can we can make it work. I think. Is there any shield
[4921.94s -> 4937.50s]  that the rogue can use? Oh, Vinny, Vinny, you're going to want to take a look at that. Oh, it's
[4937.50s -> 4947.43s]  another blue one. Do you need to take advantage? Thanks. You want this? We want this big mega chest
[4948.15s -> 4955.03s]  circles coming. You can open it because you can pick locks. I have never picked a lock in the
[4955.03s -> 4962.36s]  circles right here, so I don't I don't want to jump in the death room. I mean, it also stirred
[4962.84s -> 4966.92s]  that white altar there. That's a shrine of resurrection. Like if you have my if I die
[4966.92s -> 4976.36s]  and you take my soul, you can resurrect me. OK, OK. Nobody else is here. I mean, you could just
[4976.36s -> 4980.52s]  try to run over there and just snipe it. But oh, there's an exit portal across the hall,
[4980.52s -> 4986.12s]  like across the like on the other banister over there. Anybody want to get out now?
[4988.30s -> 4994.14s]  I'm kind of like in this the hardcore permadeath mode I'm playing with Creepo Man right now.
[4994.22s -> 4999.91s]  It's never known the touch of death. I mean, I do have some decent bows now, so I might I might go.
[4999.91s -> 5003.91s]  Oh, and I got a ranger. Oh, man. Yeah. Yeah, I have some decent stuff. I should probably leave.
[5003.91s -> 5007.88s]  Vinny, you should you should get out of here. Let me see if I even can. Oh, there's a skeleton
[5007.88s -> 5023.42s]  behind us. I forgot the Ranger has food that you can use. Give me a burger. He's in a really
[5023.42s -> 5031.00s]  weird spot. Yeah, I can make it. OK, cool. Appropriately, I took the creep perk,
[5031.00s -> 5036.82s]  which makes my my crouch walking, I think make less noise. Oh, another one.
[5037.46s -> 5041.70s]  Oh, but it still sounds like it makes a lot of noise when I'm crouching.
[5041.70s -> 5051.72s]  Is that is that imaginary? I think you I think you you always make noise, I think. But there's a
[5051.72s -> 5055.90s]  group in here. I mean, we could kind of and there's a red portal. He went the other way.
[5055.90s -> 5064.95s]  Can you get a little greedy stone cleric in here? Just one. They're probably together.
[5064.95s -> 5070.10s]  I only see one. You try to go for the jump. No, this too. There's a cleric and an archer.
[5070.10s -> 5074.06s]  And now there's three people. OK, well, they just killed somebody. We can we can sneak up
[5074.06s -> 5079.35s]  behind him. There's a fourth guy in here taking an exit portal, taking the portal up there.
[5079.35s -> 5088.57s]  They're attacking. I'm going to I'm going to engage this to this three chat.
[5088.57s -> 5091.13s]  What button goes to first person again in spectator mode?
[5094.65s -> 5099.32s]  That's the try to get out of there, sir. Yeah, I'll try.
[5099.32s -> 5106.50s]  Oh, it's literally on the screen. Wow, that's amazing. Oh, you're dead.
[5106.50s -> 5109.82s]  Jeremy, you're dead. Yes. Three of you one.
[5109.82s -> 5113.43s]  Did you have anything? No, not really.
[5113.43s -> 5119.58s]  OK, well, stirred for your first time playing. You've been escaping a lot.
[5120.54s -> 5126.28s]  When I first played this game in December, I probably it took me two hours of gameplay,
[5126.28s -> 5128.92s]  a failure to escape one time. I'm OK.
[5128.92s -> 5132.89s]  Dying. I'm OK. Dying and being like the bait there.
[5132.89s -> 5136.41s]  So you can leave with blue and stir. You can leave and make some money.
[5136.41s -> 5139.53s]  I got plenty of money. I'm all right here. I got plenty of money.
[5139.53s -> 5142.98s]  I'm already taking the yell. Good, good man.
[5143.70s -> 5150.86s]  Yeah, that's a good man. All right. I can do one or two more if you guys want.
[5150.86s -> 5154.14s]  And, you know, I know you'd want to change out, get some other people in.
[5154.22s -> 5159.24s]  Wait, what? Yeah, I mean, pretty much we got like a little group here
[5159.24s -> 5165.70s]  where everyone wants to jump in and out. Yo, 84 gold.
[5165.70s -> 5171.82s]  Yeah, that's how you make money. Are you saying you just made 84 gold?
[5171.82s -> 5175.75s]  Yeah, from that run. Yeah, that's that's a lot.
[5175.75s -> 5179.82s]  I don't feel like very good. At what point do I like,
[5179.82s -> 5184.07s]  you know, like buy a dagger or something?
[5184.07s -> 5187.51s]  Money is you really want to spend your money on the utility stuff.
[5187.51s -> 5189.99s]  So, for instance, go to at least early on here,
[5191.06s -> 5196.86s]  go to merchants and go to the alchemist buying potions and bandages.
[5197.98s -> 5199.82s]  That's kind of early where you want to spend your money
[5199.82s -> 5203.45s]  because it means you just get to live longer.
[5203.45s -> 5206.81s]  But, I mean, by all means, buy a sword, buy a weapon.
[5206.81s -> 5210.71s]  I mean, some of them are expensive.
[5210.71s -> 5214.66s]  Yeah, and usually end up finding better ones in match anyway, but yeah.
[5214.66s -> 5219.83s]  Okay. But slowly, but surely,
[5219.83s -> 5224.07s]  you'll kind of increase your survivability because as you notice now, it's just sort of,
[5224.15s -> 5227.32s]  oh, I took I'm at 50 percent HP.
[5227.32s -> 5230.52s]  Okay, well, I'm dead if we find groups of enemies or something.
[5230.52s -> 5234.28s]  Or if you let's say you kill somebody and you're at like 10 percent HP.
[5234.28s -> 5239.56s]  If you had bought three potions, it's like, okay, maybe I could keep going and leave and get out.
[5239.56s -> 5242.28s]  So you're essentially trying to survive to the point where you get
[5242.28s -> 5245.88s]  more and more and more good stuff to then hold on to it.
[5245.88s -> 5247.48s]  But then when you're like, all right, this is the time,
[5247.48s -> 5250.95s]  this is the run where I'm putting this shit on and we're going to go hard.
[5250.95s -> 5258.31s]  That's what you do. Another question.
[5259.16s -> 5261.40s]  No, go for rogue specific.
[5261.40s -> 5264.36s]  I took the cow traps and it feels like when I use them,
[5264.36s -> 5268.90s]  I throw them on my own feet and then roll in them and there's nothing I can do about it.
[5268.90s -> 5270.58s]  You can get hurt by your own stuff.
[5270.58s -> 5277.27s]  Yes. Well, I mean, like I use it and then I there's not even a chance for me to not get hurt by it.
[5277.27s -> 5280.07s]  Huh? Yeah, they suck.
[5280.07s -> 5282.07s]  They feel like they are designed for you.
[5282.07s -> 5284.84s]  Like you rub them on yourself.
[5284.84s -> 5286.52s]  They drop behind you.
[5286.52s -> 5291.40s]  Oh, I've been like looking at the ground and then walking backwards to get away from them.
[5292.79s -> 5295.83s]  So you're like you're flattening your own tires.
[5295.83s -> 5296.63s]  That's funny.
[5296.63s -> 5299.11s]  Yeah, I guess I've been flattening my own tires.
[5299.11s -> 5301.51s]  It's not like Team Fortress classic cow traps.
[5301.51s -> 5302.39s]  That's funny.
[5302.39s -> 5308.90s]  All right, we pick pocketing.
[5308.90s -> 5311.18s]  Is there? Oh, I don't know.
[5311.18s -> 5314.30s]  Rogue, you can steal an enemy's item from the dungeon.
[5314.30s -> 5315.82s]  What is that? What does that even mean?
[5315.82s -> 5316.70s]  That's pretty cool.
[5316.70s -> 5323.69s]  Someone in my chat just said if Jerma had a normal job, he'd be such a nice trainer.
[5323.69s -> 5325.34s]  Hey, thank you.
[5325.34s -> 5326.38s]  Yeah, it's nice.
[5326.38s -> 5329.48s]  I mean, trust me, I do not know that much about this game,
[5329.48s -> 5336.84s]  but I know enough to at the very least explain some very small basic details.
[5336.84s -> 5337.72s]  And that's pretty much it.
[5337.72s -> 5341.58s]  Yeah. Yeah, no, it's pretty important stuff.
[5341.58s -> 5342.70s]  So this is good. This is helpful.
[5342.70s -> 5343.18s]  Okay.
[5343.18s -> 5345.10s]  Okay, you guys make friends with someone.
[5345.10s -> 5347.10s]  I will pick pocket them.
[5347.10s -> 5347.60s]  Okay.
[5348.94s -> 5350.06s]  That's the plan. I'm ready.
[5350.06s -> 5353.98s]  All right, I'll try to be really cool and personable to someone if we run across them.
[5353.98s -> 5356.09s]  Oh, hold on.
[5356.09s -> 5359.29s]  I'll find some clothes so that I can look like reputable.
[5359.29s -> 5369.42s]  What's the push talk you said B?
[5369.42s -> 5369.74s]  Yeah.
[5370.66s -> 5371.94s]  Like burple.
[5371.94s -> 5372.82s]  B for burple.
[5375.10s -> 5382.89s]  Yeah, what's wrong with my character's name?
[5382.89s -> 5383.39s]  Ow.
[5386.26s -> 5387.46s]  I don't like the sound of that.
[5387.46s -> 5388.02s]  Dude, the one-
[5388.02s -> 5389.22s]  Someone just hurt the dog.
[5389.22s -> 5390.82s]  I know. It's not cool.
[5390.82s -> 5392.50s]  But it's always funny the first one second,
[5392.50s -> 5395.46s]  somebody just always gets hit with a sword and shot with an arrow and then we leave.
[5395.46s -> 5397.62s]  The devs are so dedicated that made this game.
[5397.62s -> 5402.66s]  They killed their own dog for that.
[5402.66s -> 5404.26s]  You're a fucking maniac.
[5404.26s -> 5405.30s]  The devs.
[5405.30s -> 5406.50s]  That is maniacal.
[5410.94s -> 5414.70s]  What's wrong with you?
[5414.70s -> 5415.98s]  Oh, nice. You got gloves.
[5416.54s -> 5417.66s]  Oh, do I?
[5417.66s -> 5419.34s]  I didn't even know I picked up gloves.
[5419.98s -> 5421.42s]  That's a power move.
[5421.42s -> 5424.14s]  There's no clothes, underwear, and gloves.
[5424.14s -> 5427.10s]  Those are like Homer Simpson gloves.
[5427.10s -> 5428.30s]  These are my pick pocket gloves.
[5428.30s -> 5431.27s]  It's like radioactive gloves.
[5431.27s -> 5432.87s]  Radioactive.
[5432.87s -> 5436.23s]  There's a really big treasure chest in here.
[5436.23s -> 5440.31s]  But this room is going to become-
[5440.31s -> 5445.99s]  Okay, so there's a mage and that's all spike traps over there.
[5445.99s -> 5449.08s]  I'm going to go for the mage.
[5451.42s -> 5452.86s]  We shouldn't even get near this
[5452.86s -> 5455.03s]  because you probably would range it and kill it.
[5455.03s -> 5457.35s]  Well, the spike traps are going to hurt it, too.
[5457.35s -> 5464.47s]  Oh, that's right.
[5464.47s -> 5465.35s]  Nice dodge.
[5465.35s -> 5467.59s]  That was actually very, very well.
[5467.59s -> 5468.23s]  That was great.
[5469.03s -> 5471.35s]  Yeah, like jumped over it.
[5471.35s -> 5477.75s]  Yeah, I don't know how I did it, but wizard robe and stuff.
[5477.75s -> 5479.22s]  Oh, stir.
[5479.22s -> 5480.26s]  Yeah, pretty well, man.
[5480.26s -> 5481.06s]  This is all you.
[5481.06s -> 5485.11s]  This is all you.
[5485.11s -> 5486.97s]  This one we can open.
[5486.97s -> 5490.09s]  You do not have sufficient skills items to do this.
[5490.09s -> 5492.09s]  Oh, do you have to?
[5492.09s -> 5493.53s]  Oh, because I don't have the perk.
[5493.53s -> 5495.37s]  Oh, yeah, I took pick pocket.
[5495.85s -> 5496.49s]  Can we break it?
[5496.49s -> 5504.04s]  Oh, I think so, but then you lose items or maybe for the regular chest.
[5504.04s -> 5504.60s]  Can you open?
[5504.60s -> 5505.72s]  Oh, no, you can't open this one either.
[5505.72s -> 5506.12s]  Never mind.
[5506.12s -> 5506.84s]  Oh, skeleton.
[5508.28s -> 5512.36s]  Maybe in the future I could have the lockpick so that I'm useful to someone.
[5514.52s -> 5520.46s]  Lockpick seems very, very, very good.
[5520.46s -> 5527.38s]  Feels like there's a lot of chests that are locked in every single game.
[5527.38s -> 5529.62s]  Okay, can we check the loot here?
[5530.58s -> 5531.06s]  Falchion.
[5533.42s -> 5535.34s]  Jerma, you might want a white falchion.
[5535.34s -> 5536.46s]  It's not bad.
[5536.46s -> 5537.10s]  Yeah, I'll take it.
[5537.66s -> 5538.70s]  What was that, sir?
[5538.70s -> 5539.66s]  What's in there?
[5539.66s -> 5541.10s]  Just a couple of flying skulls.
[5541.82s -> 5542.30s]  Okay.
[5543.67s -> 5544.07s]  All right.
[5546.79s -> 5549.58s]  We should probably go towards the circle.
[5549.58s -> 5552.46s]  Yeah, there's going to be flying skulls.
[5552.46s -> 5554.71s]  So let's get them.
[5557.98s -> 5560.06s]  You can't disarm any of these traps.
[5560.06s -> 5561.74s]  Or can you with like a perk or something?
[5562.62s -> 5563.66s]  I think there was a trap.
[5564.62s -> 5565.42s]  Oh, there's spiders.
[5567.62s -> 5568.74s]  Red spiders.
[5568.74s -> 5571.13s]  Yeah, I got the light.
[5572.41s -> 5575.22s]  You got this.
[5575.22s -> 5575.94s]  Okay.
[5575.94s -> 5580.46s]  Damn, it's a bandage.
[5582.20s -> 5584.20s]  You know, is the lantern any good?
[5587.56s -> 5590.26s]  Oh, you can aim the light.
[5590.26s -> 5591.86s]  I thought it was just like the thing that sat on your hip.
[5593.00s -> 5593.64s]  That's what it is.
[5593.64s -> 5594.52s]  You aim it.
[5594.52s -> 5595.40s]  That's cool.
[5595.40s -> 5600.98s]  Jerma, here, why don't you...
[5600.98s -> 5601.62s]  Oh, shit.
[5602.82s -> 5603.14s]  Hang on.
[5603.14s -> 5604.50s]  Let's take care of these bugs first.
[5604.50s -> 5605.30s]  We'll talk.
[5605.30s -> 5607.46s]  Oh, this is a spawner.
[5607.46s -> 5607.94s]  This pot.
[5607.94s -> 5608.82s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5608.82s -> 5609.30s]  You got it.
[5609.30s -> 5609.70s]  Okay.
[5609.70s -> 5613.70s]  That's a lot of bugs.
[5623.30s -> 5623.54s]  All right.
[5624.82s -> 5625.22s]  You look so funny.
[5625.22s -> 5626.26s]  I'm pushing here for you, Jerma.
[5626.26s -> 5627.62s]  Oh, they're eating me.
[5630.42s -> 5632.02s]  You should take the potion at this point.
[5632.02s -> 5632.50s]  Oh, this is...
[5632.50s -> 5633.06s]  No, I have...
[5633.06s -> 5633.78s]  I have healing.
[5633.78s -> 5634.98s]  I have self-heal.
[5640.58s -> 5641.94s]  There's a lot of shit in here.
[5641.94s -> 5644.09s]  I'm hearing a lot of noise.
[5644.09s -> 5644.41s]  Yeah.
[5644.41s -> 5645.53s]  They're eating her.
[5645.53s -> 5646.49s]  And then they're going to eat me.
[5647.21s -> 5648.09s]  Oh, my God.
[5651.37s -> 5652.49s]  Bunch of enemies in here.
[5652.49s -> 5653.77s]  Let's let them come through the door.
[5654.65s -> 5656.73s]  I can shoot them through the door as well.
[5657.53s -> 5659.02s]  Take a while, but...
[5663.75s -> 5667.27s]  Oh, God.
[5667.27s -> 5667.75s]  He's got me.
[5670.10s -> 5673.93s]  Nice.
[5675.98s -> 5677.10s]  There's a spawner in there.
[5678.39s -> 5678.63s]  All right.
[5678.63s -> 5679.99s]  He had a diamond.
[5679.99s -> 5680.55s]  Is that...
[5680.55s -> 5682.23s]  Do I kind of make it like a diamond armor set?
[5682.23s -> 5683.67s]  Yo, careful, careful, careful.
[5684.47s -> 5685.19s]  Oh, I'm stuck.
[5685.19s -> 5685.51s]  Who wants...
[5686.23s -> 5687.03s]  Circle's coming in.
[5688.22s -> 5691.26s]  Who wants the fountain of speed or whatever?
[5691.90s -> 5692.38s]  Lockpick.
[5695.06s -> 5695.30s]  All right.
[5695.30s -> 5696.26s]  Let me get the spawner.
[5696.90s -> 5697.70s]  Oh, that's not good.
[5697.70s -> 5698.66s]  Oh, man.
[5700.66s -> 5701.94s]  Whoa, I just got pulled.
[5701.94s -> 5704.10s]  All right, we should go through the door.
[5707.98s -> 5708.70s]  Careful, Sturrier.
[5708.70s -> 5719.42s]  You're the only one in there.
[5719.42s -> 5720.70s]  Hope I didn't just shoot you, Jerma.
[5720.70s -> 5721.10s]  Did I?
[5721.10s -> 5721.66s]  Nope.
[5721.66s -> 5725.67s]  Okay.
[5727.77s -> 5729.53s]  You look like such a dickhead when you do that.
[5731.11s -> 5731.75s]  Okay, so...
[5731.75s -> 5734.55s]  Looking down and just stabbing.
[5734.55s -> 5737.19s]  This one is not locked, actually, this big chest.
[5741.78s -> 5744.42s]  You guys can take some of the stuff in this big chest if you want.
[5744.42s -> 5744.82s]  I have a...
[5744.82s -> 5745.70s]  Just to sell or whatever.
[5745.70s -> 5746.90s]  I have a lockpick, but I've only...
[5747.46s -> 5748.18s]  Oh, what was that?
[5748.18s -> 5749.38s]  Skeleton, skeleton shooting.
[5749.38s -> 5750.02s]  Oh, shit.
[5750.02s -> 5750.98s]  That's what it was.
[5750.98s -> 5751.62s]  I got the door.
[5751.62s -> 5752.26s]  I'm going to get the door.
[5752.26s -> 5752.98s]  I'm going to get the door.
[5752.98s -> 5753.78s]  I'm going to get the door.
[5754.34s -> 5754.66s]  Okay.
[5758.07s -> 5758.79s]  Another skeleton.
[5759.35s -> 5763.82s]  It's bleeding.
[5766.81s -> 5767.93s]  Nice, Stur.
[5767.93s -> 5768.25s]  Okay.
[5768.25s -> 5771.37s]  Is this a shrine of impactful speed, you said?
[5773.43s -> 5774.63s]  Yeah, there's that blue shrine.
[5775.59s -> 5776.47s]  Sacrifice.
[5776.47s -> 5778.31s]  The blue one over there is extra speed,
[5778.31s -> 5780.31s]  but it doesn't really last that long, so...
[5780.31s -> 5784.44s]  Yeah, if you die, then yeah, that's where you bring somebody back.
[5784.44s -> 5785.48s]  Shitty...
[5785.48s -> 5787.40s]  Well, it's not shitty if it's green on this guy over here.
[5789.08s -> 5791.37s]  Vinny, you should just take this.
[5791.37s -> 5794.18s]  You know, I'm going to take the shitty green anyway.
[5794.18s -> 5795.53s]  Oh, what's this?
[5795.53s -> 5796.09s]  The health?
[5797.13s -> 5797.77s]  Sure.
[5797.77s -> 5799.53s]  I mean, we all have full health.
[5799.53s -> 5801.69s]  We're going to be getting out of here.
[5801.77s -> 5803.69s]  Yeah, we got to get out of here like right now.
[5803.69s -> 5806.01s]  Vinny, what are your final thoughts on Metroid Prime Remastered?
[5806.01s -> 5808.49s]  I haven't finished it yet, so I don't have final thoughts, but it's good so far.
[5808.49s -> 5809.59s]  Okay, let's get out of here.
[5809.59s -> 5811.40s]  Yeah, let's get out.
[5811.40s -> 5815.78s]  It's going to hurt.
[5815.78s -> 5816.66s]  Yeah, this is going to hurt.
[5816.66s -> 5820.22s]  Out, out, out, out, out.
[5820.22s -> 5821.34s]  Trying to speed again.
[5821.34s -> 5823.00s]  All right, mine's still going.
[5823.00s -> 5825.88s]  Oh, Vinny, you can just take it.
[5825.88s -> 5826.28s]  All right.
[5828.70s -> 5833.11s]  How do you holster again?
[5835.08s -> 5835.64s]  Okay.
[5835.64s -> 5836.44s]  What's down here?
[5836.44s -> 5838.63s]  Whoa, wait.
[5838.63s -> 5839.11s]  Big room.
[5839.83s -> 5840.79s]  No, never mind.
[5840.79s -> 5841.83s]  Just a little secret passage.
[5841.83s -> 5842.87s]  That's a connector.
[5843.96s -> 5844.68s]  Don't see anyone.
[5848.71s -> 5851.29s]  This place has been looted.
[5851.29s -> 5853.21s]  Yeah, we're getting out of the final five minutes.
[5853.21s -> 5858.70s]  This is going to start to get a little hairy.
[5858.70s -> 5860.86s]  Oh, there's a mimic down there.
[5860.86s -> 5865.30s]  I don't know if it's still alive to the north.
[5865.30s -> 5867.69s]  Turn the roaster on.
[5867.69s -> 5868.49s]  Turn the roaster off.
[5873.32s -> 5877.64s]  We should just get out of here because we're going to get in trouble by the circle.
[5877.64s -> 5879.40s]  Okay, careful with that jump.
[5879.40s -> 5881.32s]  Yeah, make sure you're holstered before doing that jump.
[5882.44s -> 5883.64s]  How do you do that again?
[5883.64s -> 5886.36s]  X.
[5886.36s -> 5889.56s]  Um, shrine of protection.
[5889.56s -> 5892.76s]  I would recommend you get it, Star, because you're squishy.
[5892.76s -> 5893.96s]  Yeah, you have no gloves on.
[5893.96s -> 5895.64s]  Oh, you got us the gloves.
[5895.64s -> 5897.50s]  Right here, this red one.
[5897.50s -> 5899.51s]  Oh, there's a chest.
[5899.51s -> 5901.26s]  Oh, okay.
[5901.26s -> 5902.46s]  What is that?
[5902.46s -> 5903.98s]  People coming, people coming.
[5903.98s -> 5905.02s]  No, I'm just shooting this.
[5905.66s -> 5907.10s]  No, there's people behind this door.
[5907.10s -> 5907.42s]  Okay.
[5907.42s -> 5907.98s]  Oh, no shit.
[5909.70s -> 5911.26s]  One guy.
[5911.26s -> 5912.38s]  Hey, you friendly?
[5912.38s -> 5913.88s]  That's crap.
[5913.88s -> 5914.68s]  Okay, cool.
[5914.68s -> 5917.38s]  I got my boys down there.
[5917.38s -> 5918.74s]  Are they friendly?
[5918.74s -> 5921.53s]  Are they friendly?
[5921.53s -> 5922.49s]  We are friendly.
[5922.49s -> 5924.33s]  Please do not kill.
[5924.33s -> 5925.37s]  Oh, my goodness.
[5925.37s -> 5926.25s]  They're friendly.
[5926.25s -> 5927.05s]  Uh, open the door.
[5927.05s -> 5927.69s]  They opened the portal.
[5929.99s -> 5931.83s]  No, by George, we've just...
[5931.83s -> 5933.91s]  Hey, no, no, we're all good here.
[5933.91s -> 5934.55s]  How are you guys doing?
[5934.55s -> 5934.87s]  Good?
[5934.87s -> 5938.94s]  Just, just crouch three times if you're good.
[5938.94s -> 5939.50s]  That's three.
[5939.50s -> 5940.22s]  That's awesome.
[5940.22s -> 5941.83s]  That's good.
[5941.83s -> 5944.95s]  But I say we should probably try to find a portal together.
[5944.95s -> 5945.83s]  Stir lock, pick them.
[5946.39s -> 5947.51s]  Or tick-tock it.
[5947.51s -> 5949.00s]  He can hear, they can hear you.
[5949.00s -> 5951.19s]  Did I say that out loud?
[5951.19s -> 5952.31s]  Did you talk in game?
[5953.43s -> 5954.15s]  Guys, I was kidding.
[5954.15s -> 5954.47s]  Come on.
[5954.47s -> 5956.25s]  That was a joke.
[5956.25s -> 5956.89s]  Well, no, no.
[5956.89s -> 5957.93s]  Oh, wait, they're coming back.
[5958.01s -> 5958.49s]  They're coming back.
[5958.49s -> 5959.21s]  Are they fighting?
[5959.21s -> 5962.22s]  That's a pretty poor joke of you.
[5962.22s -> 5963.02s]  We were just messing around.
[5963.02s -> 5963.82s]  We were just messing around.
[5964.62s -> 5965.18s]  We'll help you.
[5965.18s -> 5966.78s]  We'll help you guys get out of here.
[5966.78s -> 5967.98s]  We don't need to hurt each other.
[5967.98s -> 5972.06s]  This is hard enough without violence, you know.
[5972.06s -> 5973.18s]  Oh, hey, no, no, no.
[5973.18s -> 5973.98s]  All of us are friends.
[5974.54s -> 5975.90s]  There's like six of us.
[5975.90s -> 5976.78s]  It's not worth it.
[5976.78s -> 5977.50s]  It's not worth it.
[5977.50s -> 5978.78s]  No, no, no, no.
[5978.78s -> 5979.18s]  Trust me.
[5979.90s -> 5981.02s]  We're going to get out of here together.
[5981.02s -> 5981.10s]  All of us.
[5981.10s -> 5983.58s]  Everybody just relax and let's do this diplomatically.
[5983.58s -> 5985.02s]  No, we've literally just got in a fight.
[5985.02s -> 5986.38s]  We thought you guys were part of this team.
[5986.38s -> 5986.94s]  It's all good.
[5986.94s -> 5987.66s]  It's all good.
[5987.90s -> 5990.78s]  We're trying to get out with the loot that we have, too, gentlemen.
[5992.06s -> 5993.02s]  What he said.
[5993.02s -> 5995.26s]  I picked pocket like six times.
[5997.66s -> 5998.30s]  I found a portal.
[5998.30s -> 5998.78s]  I'm getting out.
[6001.74s -> 6003.18s]  This is I hate this.
[6003.18s -> 6003.98s]  I hate this.
[6003.98s -> 6005.42s]  I'm opening this fucking thing.
[6005.42s -> 6008.46s]  I'm going to fucking get back to home base and be like, what?
[6008.46s -> 6008.94s]  What?
[6008.94s -> 6011.02s]  I thought what the fuck was that?
[6011.58s -> 6012.14s]  How did I do?
[6012.14s -> 6012.70s]  What do I do?
[6013.42s -> 6015.02s]  Oh, I tried to open the chest.
[6015.02s -> 6016.22s]  I seem to have messed up.
[6016.22s -> 6017.10s]  I didn't open it.
[6018.55s -> 6019.99s]  See plenty of portals for all.
[6023.29s -> 6023.53s]  Wow.
[6023.53s -> 6024.57s]  We actually got out.
[6024.57s -> 6027.21s]  Probably should have given that lot pick to somebody that knew what they were doing.
[6027.93s -> 6029.61s]  I should have kept pick pocketing.
[6029.61s -> 6030.57s]  Jerma, just run through it.
[6030.57s -> 6031.05s]  Run through it.
[6032.90s -> 6033.22s]  Damn.
[6034.18s -> 6038.18s]  Is this like just like hang out near someone that's going to take a blue portal
[6038.18s -> 6039.86s]  and then just just run in at the last second?
[6042.01s -> 6043.21s]  Like a real asshole.
[6043.21s -> 6044.33s]  Oh, there's a portal here.
[6044.33s -> 6045.45s]  Did you really pick pocket?
[6045.45s -> 6046.57s]  Yeah, I'll offer it to him.
[6049.77s -> 6050.33s]  Thank you.
[6050.33s -> 6051.93s]  I really appreciate it.
[6051.93s -> 6053.05s]  Good luck in your journey.
[6053.05s -> 6054.57s]  Good luck in your adventures going forward.
[6055.37s -> 6057.69s]  Gentlemen, I bid you adieu.
[6060.82s -> 6061.30s]  We got it.
[6061.30s -> 6062.50s]  I can't believe this worked.
[6063.14s -> 6063.54s]  What?
[6063.54s -> 6067.54s]  I hate that.
[6067.54s -> 6068.26s]  I don't like this.
[6069.38s -> 6070.26s]  It's too awful.
[6071.06s -> 6071.70s]  It worked.
[6072.26s -> 6072.98s]  What did you take?
[6073.86s -> 6074.58s]  I'm not sure.
[6074.58s -> 6079.54s]  You just like hold a steel behind them and then it didn't like open a menu or anything.
[6079.54s -> 6081.64s]  So I don't know what I took.
[6081.64s -> 6082.84s]  I have 10 silver coins.
[6082.84s -> 6083.56s]  I don't think I had.
[6085.00s -> 6086.84s]  It's jewelry usually.
[6086.84s -> 6089.40s]  Yeah, I did not have these 10 silver coins.
[6090.33s -> 6091.53s]  So you stole silver.
[6091.53s -> 6092.81s]  They probably aren't even going to notice.
[6094.14s -> 6094.86s]  I'll be honest.
[6094.86s -> 6098.70s]  If like a few silver coins are gone from my pocket, I wouldn't even know.
[6098.70s -> 6100.46s]  Oh, I got like throwing knives.
[6100.46s -> 6101.34s]  I didn't have those.
[6103.75s -> 6108.55s]  This is democracy manifest.
[6108.55s -> 6109.43s]  That was amazing.
[6109.43s -> 6112.42s]  And we all made it somehow.
[6112.42s -> 6115.30s]  Like someone in my chat just said, I can't believe
[6115.30s -> 6117.54s]  completely one-sided chatting with randos worked.
[6118.44s -> 6119.80s]  Like we don't even know what they're saying.
[6122.46s -> 6125.18s]  We were just like talking over everybody being cartoon characters.
[6125.18s -> 6126.54s]  And then it would like work somehow.
[6127.88s -> 6130.92s]  Jerma, there was no voice chat in the game last beta.
[6130.92s -> 6131.80s]  This is brand new.
[6131.80s -> 6133.08s]  So you couldn't negotiate.
[6133.08s -> 6136.44s]  And every time you ran into someone, it was almost a guaranteed death.
[6136.44s -> 6137.72s]  Yeah, that's funny.
[6137.72s -> 6140.71s]  All right.
[6140.71s -> 6142.15s]  Do you want me to hop out or?
[6143.61s -> 6144.73s]  Let's take a look.
[6144.73s -> 6147.61s]  I mean, I'm going to be playing this literally all night.
[6147.61s -> 6151.61s]  So, okay, if you want to stick around and there's other people that are, I mean, well,
[6151.61s -> 6153.93s]  I could do one more with you if that's cool.
[6153.93s -> 6157.85s]  Yeah, I'll do one more and then I'll bounce and I'll get some of my own groups going.
[6157.85s -> 6158.33s]  Yeah.
[6158.33s -> 6163.99s]  All right.
[6163.99s -> 6167.16s]  I'm thinking about going in with some gear this time.
[6167.16s -> 6171.37s]  Not thinking of thinking I should have pickpocketed more people.
[6171.37s -> 6175.67s]  Is this is this like a like, let's go for it round.
[6175.67s -> 6176.63s]  I'm down.
[6176.63s -> 6179.08s]  I mean, they went to the red portal.
[6179.08s -> 6182.92s]  I'm wondering if we were like, do you think we have the skill for a red portal?
[6182.92s -> 6185.11s]  Probably not.
[6185.11s -> 6185.51s]  Right.
[6185.51s -> 6186.63s]  I mean, we could try it.
[6186.63s -> 6187.91s]  Why not even just try it?
[6187.91s -> 6188.90s]  Okay.
[6188.90s -> 6190.66s]  If we see red portal, we do.
[6190.66s -> 6192.34s]  If not, then we we leave.
[6192.34s -> 6193.48s]  All right.
[6193.48s -> 6198.44s]  I'm going to bring at least like something like a better like, yeah, it's all right.
[6198.44s -> 6199.00s]  Well, you know what?
[6199.00s -> 6199.48s]  You know, fuck it.
[6199.48s -> 6200.90s]  Let's just do it.
[6200.90s -> 6201.54s]  Okay.
[6201.54s -> 6202.50s]  Honest to goodness.
[6203.64s -> 6205.93s]  Let's play.
[6205.93s -> 6206.97s]  All right, gamers.
[6206.97s -> 6212.41s]  I'll be in rats.
[6212.41s -> 6214.92s]  What do you mean?
[6214.92s -> 6216.04s]  I bought a Glock.
[6216.04s -> 6219.67s]  People saying do not go in red.
[6219.67s -> 6220.71s]  Where do you get that?
[6220.71s -> 6228.66s]  Yeah, we can just try it if we want to.
[6228.66s -> 6229.38s]  Well, we'll see.
[6229.38s -> 6234.98s]  I mean, yeah, the one time I actually maybe two times I went to the red portal.
[6234.98s -> 6236.10s]  It was a nightmare.
[6236.10s -> 6236.34s]  Yeah.
[6239.54s -> 6240.42s]  Oh, that's a yawn.
[6240.42s -> 6241.38s]  That was a dog yawn.
[6241.38s -> 6244.02s]  I thought someone donkey punched the dog last time.
[6244.02s -> 6245.90s]  Honest to goodness.
[6245.90s -> 6246.46s]  Let's game.
[6255.27s -> 6258.07s]  Ster is slowly adding a piece of clothing every run.
[6258.07s -> 6258.31s]  Yeah.
[6259.72s -> 6260.84s]  Oh, do you have something new now?
[6260.84s -> 6263.10s]  He's got a hood now.
[6263.10s -> 6263.34s]  Yeah.
[6263.90s -> 6265.58s]  Yeah, I added something.
[6265.58s -> 6276.92s]  I'm evolving characters developing.
[6276.92s -> 6278.76s]  Well, I'm literally just getting rid of trash.
[6278.76s -> 6279.80s]  Don't don't pick this stuff up.
[6279.80s -> 6280.12s]  It's bad.
[6280.12s -> 6281.08s]  I need that.
[6281.08s -> 6284.68s]  Unless you need boots, which Jerma, you could actually probably benefit from.
[6284.68s -> 6285.88s]  I could probably benefit from.
[6285.88s -> 6287.24s]  Yeah, some of this just random stuff.
[6287.24s -> 6288.44s]  The gloves, too.
[6288.44s -> 6290.82s]  Fair enough.
[6290.82s -> 6292.58s]  Well, I'm so sorry.
[6293.38s -> 6294.02s]  You punch me.
[6294.58s -> 6297.94s]  Yeah, I clicked back into the game and just wailed on you.
[6297.94s -> 6300.73s]  Hey, this is supposed to be a red portal run.
[6300.73s -> 6303.93s]  And I'm already down like three or 4% health.
[6303.93s -> 6306.57s]  I mean, I can't even exit the door because you're standing in the way.
[6306.57s -> 6308.57s]  Well, I'm looking at you.
[6308.57s -> 6310.57s]  Oh, we were talking about eternal cylinder.
[6310.57s -> 6316.12s]  Yeah, I think generally we found that we were in generally the same part of the game
[6316.12s -> 6320.22s]  when we kind of both had some struggle with it.
[6320.22s -> 6323.34s]  But like my chat came into your chat and was like Vinny hated this game.
[6323.34s -> 6324.78s]  I didn't hate it.
[6324.78s -> 6326.54s]  I liked it enough to finish it.
[6326.54s -> 6328.30s]  Yeah, it was it was a nice experience.
[6328.30s -> 6330.42s]  It just was a little too long.
[6330.42s -> 6334.97s]  Yeah, like two or three hours too long.
[6334.97s -> 6337.85s]  Vinny donkey punch does not mean what you think it means.
[6337.85s -> 6338.81s]  Oh, oops.
[6338.81s -> 6339.21s]  Sorry.
[6339.21s -> 6339.53s]  Sorry.
[6340.39s -> 6341.35s]  I meant sucker punch.
[6344.26s -> 6346.90s]  Maybe we shouldn't ask.
[6346.90s -> 6348.74s]  Oh, twenty nine damage.
[6348.74s -> 6352.70s]  I'm in so somebody's shooting arrows at my head.
[6352.70s -> 6355.72s]  Oh, it's you.
[6355.72s -> 6357.48s]  Jerma went out was playing Metroid earlier.
[6357.48s -> 6362.39s]  I got the morph ball and I said I got the mouthball.
[6362.39s -> 6363.11s]  Oh, nice.
[6364.68s -> 6365.32s]  All right.
[6365.32s -> 6369.40s]  The garlic is coming and coming into your your brain here.
[6369.40s -> 6374.81s]  I see a skeleton.
[6374.81s -> 6376.97s]  I joined the party now.
[6376.97s -> 6378.09s]  Oh, hey, everyone.
[6378.09s -> 6378.81s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[6378.81s -> 6379.45s]  We we good.
[6379.45s -> 6379.93s]  We good.
[6379.93s -> 6380.57s]  We cool.
[6380.57s -> 6380.97s]  No, no, no.
[6380.97s -> 6381.77s]  Don't do don't do that.
[6381.77s -> 6382.73s]  We'll still forgive you.
[6382.73s -> 6383.45s]  We'll still forgive you.
[6383.45s -> 6383.95s]  It's fine.
[6384.65s -> 6384.97s]  All right.
[6384.97s -> 6385.29s]  Kill him.
[6385.29s -> 6385.61s]  Kill him.
[6385.61s -> 6388.26s]  He's killing us.
[6388.26s -> 6390.18s]  I'm I'm fumbling the controls.
[6390.18s -> 6390.98s]  I fumbled.
[6390.98s -> 6392.50s]  Please do not let me fumble further.
[6392.50s -> 6396.79s]  How many fuck I'm dead.
[6396.79s -> 6399.93s]  I've accomplished nothing.
[6403.54s -> 6404.66s]  I didn't do my heel either.
[6405.30s -> 6406.81s]  I got him.
[6406.81s -> 6407.93s]  Wait, what do you mean you got him?
[6407.93s -> 6408.43s]  He's down.
[6409.67s -> 6410.95s]  Like all of them.
[6410.95s -> 6411.91s]  There's one guy.
[6411.91s -> 6412.87s]  I don't know.
[6412.87s -> 6414.71s]  There's literally one guy.
[6414.71s -> 6415.75s]  Jerma, did you kill one?
[6415.75s -> 6416.39s]  I killed one.
[6416.39s -> 6416.89s]  Yeah.
[6418.58s -> 6420.50s]  Oh, well, I ran away like a coward.
[6420.50s -> 6422.82s]  I thought they were friendly at first because he was making sounds.
[6422.82s -> 6428.15s]  But when you were like, we're friendly and he was like, I was like, oh, okay.
[6428.15s -> 6430.23s]  But that was him grunting while he was swinging at us.
[6431.11s -> 6432.47s]  Yes, not friendly sounds.
[6432.47s -> 6432.97s]  Yeah.
[6434.04s -> 6436.20s]  I have your heart so we can.
[6436.20s -> 6438.31s]  It's a weird thing to say, but it's true.
[6438.87s -> 6440.71s]  I can just we can revive you.
[6440.71s -> 6444.66s]  We can revive you is what I'm trying to say.
[6444.66s -> 6445.46s]  Oh, yeah.
[6445.46s -> 6446.66s]  No, I didn't have it.
[6446.66s -> 6449.06s]  I had literally just absolute dog shit on.
[6449.06s -> 6453.22s]  I had like a I think I had a green helmet on and that was it.
[6453.22s -> 6453.78s]  Okay.
[6453.78s -> 6454.50s]  Well, I got that.
[6454.50s -> 6458.01s]  So we'll try to find you and get you back.
[6458.01s -> 6461.27s]  Cool gaming.
[6461.27s -> 6464.47s]  People are saying that that was just the barbarian sound effects.
[6465.27s -> 6466.23s]  Was it?
[6466.23s -> 6469.83s]  No, he was clearly going like over the voice chat, wasn't it?
[6469.83s -> 6470.90s]  I don't know.
[6470.90s -> 6472.26s]  No, that sounded like in-game.
[6472.74s -> 6478.87s]  The guy did not run at you in real life going.
[6479.99s -> 6483.35s]  I thought he was being like funny over the voice comms.
[6483.35s -> 6486.39s]  I don't think they're funny.
[6486.39s -> 6487.67s]  I'm going to head down this way.
[6488.63s -> 6491.99s]  We can get out of the circle and try to find a shrine of resurrection.
[6491.99s -> 6492.63s]  He was.
[6492.63s -> 6494.82s]  Yeah, no, he definitely was.
[6494.82s -> 6496.31s]  Careful.
[6496.31s -> 6497.03s]  Don't stand up.
[6497.03s -> 6497.67s]  Whatever you do.
[6498.47s -> 6500.28s]  I won't.
[6500.28s -> 6500.92s]  Okay.
[6500.92s -> 6505.42s]  My main strategy is letting you go first.
[6505.42s -> 6506.76s]  That's a good one.
[6506.76s -> 6507.48s]  Wait, I'm an archer.
[6508.52s -> 6509.40s]  That doesn't check out.
[6511.75s -> 6512.71s]  We got skeleton here.
[6513.75s -> 6515.35s]  Someone might be behind us.
[6515.35s -> 6516.47s]  Can you stop turning those off?
[6517.67s -> 6522.30s]  I'm trying to watch my TV show of you guys playing and it's dark now.
[6522.30s -> 6529.85s]  And darker.
[6529.85s -> 6531.69s]  Invisibility potion.
[6531.69s -> 6533.08s]  Those are okay.
[6533.08s -> 6543.67s]  You can't really attack when you have them, but good to get out of a shitty situation.
[6543.67s -> 6545.59s]  Oh, good luck.
[6545.59s -> 6547.67s]  Yeah, you're not going to kill that dude.
[6548.47s -> 6549.74s]  Careful, sir.
[6549.74s -> 6551.50s]  There's another fucking spike in the wall.
[6552.38s -> 6555.42s]  That Wraith will kill you both in like one hit.
[6557.14s -> 6557.46s]  Yes, sir.
[6557.46s -> 6562.47s]  There's like random hard, I guess in quotes, enemies.
[6562.47s -> 6564.31s]  Like I said, I'm pretty familiar with the gameplay.
[6564.31s -> 6567.99s]  So I've seen Wraiths and stuff.
[6567.99s -> 6569.11s]  Did you loot this guy?
[6570.47s -> 6574.89s]  I kind of didn't want to because there was a Wraith.
[6574.89s -> 6579.91s]  I felt like maybe, maybe not.
[6579.91s -> 6581.88s]  Oh, they had some gold.
[6581.88s -> 6582.92s]  I took a little bit of their gold.
[6585.06s -> 6586.18s]  I took their pants.
[6586.18s -> 6595.83s]  This is a treasure chest here.
[6595.83s -> 6597.43s]  You know, I do have a campfire kit.
[6597.43s -> 6602.42s]  If we find a nice quiet area, I can, we can recover all of our health.
[6602.42s -> 6605.46s]  Yeah, you absolutely should, especially because you guys are two now.
[6605.46s -> 6609.88s]  You're going to, if you go to, there's a group of three that have half health
[6609.88s -> 6612.20s]  versus, you know, you have full health.
[6614.86s -> 6616.14s]  I'm hearing a lot of footsteps.
[6616.14s -> 6617.66s]  I'm trying, like, I get that.
[6617.66s -> 6619.10s]  It's like you're doing like a stream.
[6619.74s -> 6621.74s]  You're trying to like talk to your friends and shit.
[6622.46s -> 6624.30s]  There's definitely people that way.
[6625.50s -> 6626.95s]  There's a mummy.
[6626.95s -> 6628.62s]  Oh, red mummy.
[6629.26s -> 6642.60s]  Pretty good with that right here.
[6644.44s -> 6646.25s]  Ow.
[6646.25s -> 6649.90s]  Yeah, we got to, we desperately got to heal up here.
[6649.90s -> 6650.86s]  Stir, you know what?
[6650.86s -> 6651.90s]  You just can't fire down here.
[6651.90s -> 6653.10s]  I don't think anyone's going to use it.
[6653.10s -> 6653.74s]  I'm going to use it here.
[6653.74s -> 6653.90s]  Yeah.
[6653.90s -> 6654.78s]  I'm going to use it here.
[6654.78s -> 6659.85s]  Just do me a favor, stir.
[6659.85s -> 6662.41s]  When you get in here, crouch.
[6662.41s -> 6666.52s]  Don't stand up and also put up the light.
[6666.52s -> 6666.92s]  Maybe.
[6666.92s -> 6667.64s]  All right.
[6667.64s -> 6667.88s]  Okay.
[6667.88s -> 6668.84s]  Get in here before.
[6668.84s -> 6671.62s]  Okay.
[6671.62s -> 6673.14s]  How much does the campfire heal?
[6673.14s -> 6675.54s]  I know it does refresh on spells too, right?
[6675.54s -> 6677.78s]  I'm not sure about this.
[6677.78s -> 6678.02s]  Yeah.
[6678.02s -> 6684.79s]  I haven't used it as a wizard yet, but it looks like it's healing a decent amount
[6684.79s -> 6686.71s]  for as long as you're in front of it.
[6686.71s -> 6688.87s]  It's like full health for me from now.
[6690.55s -> 6691.11s]  Close.
[6691.11s -> 6693.05s]  40, 50 percent.
[6693.05s -> 6699.99s]  I'd say it was like 65, 70 percent.
[6699.99s -> 6702.87s]  It refreshes most skills, not only wizard.
[6702.87s -> 6705.02s]  That's actually a huge deal.
[6705.02s -> 6708.38s]  Especially if you have one that gets consumed, like the fighter of heal.
[6708.38s -> 6709.18s]  That's a big deal.
[6709.18s -> 6711.98s]  Hey, we got a little secret tunnel down here.
[6711.98s -> 6712.46s]  Yeah.
[6712.46s -> 6719.37s]  Oh, okay, cool.
[6719.37s -> 6721.21s]  I think there's an escape.
[6721.21s -> 6722.01s]  No, that's a wraith.
[6722.01s -> 6723.53s]  He's glowing the same blue.
[6725.94s -> 6727.38s]  Now an escape just appeared.
[6727.38s -> 6729.22s]  There's a guy behind us from the way we came.
[6729.22s -> 6730.71s]  That's so scary.
[6731.43s -> 6733.43s]  That is like terrifying looking.
[6734.79s -> 6735.35s]  That's a rogue.
[6735.35s -> 6736.23s]  You want to take this?
[6736.23s -> 6737.19s]  Is that a rogue or a mage?
[6738.60s -> 6740.74s]  You take it.
[6740.74s -> 6741.22s]  You sure?
[6741.78s -> 6742.79s]  Yeah.
[6742.79s -> 6745.03s]  All right.
[6745.03s -> 6745.67s]  All right.
[6745.67s -> 6747.35s]  Nice job.
[6747.35s -> 6747.83s]  All right.
[6747.83s -> 6748.63s]  Good luck, sir.
[6748.63s -> 6752.12s]  Looks like a whole party.
[6752.12s -> 6752.60s]  Oh, man.
[6752.60s -> 6752.84s]  Yeah.
[6752.84s -> 6756.58s]  Just stay in this.
[6756.58s -> 6757.14s]  Don't bump me.
[6761.21s -> 6763.56s]  Oh, my God.
[6763.56s -> 6764.04s]  Oh, yeah.
[6764.04s -> 6764.60s]  They're bumping you.
[6764.60s -> 6765.40s]  They're bumping you.
[6765.40s -> 6766.94s]  They might just think it's lag.
[6768.10s -> 6770.18s]  They do like he's like, oh, what was that?
[6770.18s -> 6771.06s]  They just kept going.
[6771.70s -> 6773.62s]  I mean, that's what I would think if I like, why can't I move?
[6773.62s -> 6774.34s]  What's going on?
[6774.34s -> 6774.98s]  That'd be lag.
[6775.86s -> 6777.93s]  You have an invisibility potion too, right?
[6779.02s -> 6786.54s]  Nice smart, smart, smart, smart gaming.
[6786.54s -> 6787.98s]  Oh, you can't move when you do it.
[6787.98s -> 6789.10s]  Oh, that's so lame.
[6789.10s -> 6790.46s]  Oh, that you can't.
[6790.46s -> 6793.05s]  Close the door behind you.
[6793.05s -> 6794.81s]  Yeah, you're in the hell room, sir.
[6794.81s -> 6796.65s]  Pretty much everybody's going to be here in a second.
[6796.65s -> 6797.82s]  Three minutes.
[6803.46s -> 6808.20s]  Oh, it's a perk to do that.
[6808.20s -> 6810.36s]  There's a perk to make it so you can move 10 steps.
[6810.36s -> 6811.48s]  I have that.
[6811.48s -> 6812.60s]  Just just talk to them.
[6812.60s -> 6813.56s]  Just just reason with them.
[6816.47s -> 6817.91s]  All right.
[6817.91s -> 6818.63s]  I fucked up.
[6818.63s -> 6821.75s]  I mean, I would have stayed invisible, but I have that perk.
[6821.75s -> 6823.67s]  But it's not my invisibility.
[6823.67s -> 6825.91s]  So I don't know if it would work that way.
[6828.94s -> 6830.62s]  Jerma, I still have some of the stuff.
[6830.62s -> 6831.50s]  I don't know how to.
[6831.50s -> 6834.44s]  I don't think I can give it to you in the menu here, but.
[6834.44s -> 6841.61s]  No, no, the only way you can trade is kind of is we would have to both join the trader thing.
[6841.61s -> 6845.66s]  And it's 15 gold to do any transaction, from my understanding.
[6845.66s -> 6849.96s]  Or you have to bring it and drop it, which bringing it and dropping it is a scary thing in its own way.
[6849.96s -> 6853.24s]  Oh, no, I was going to have that perk, but then I had to take pickpocket.
[6853.24s -> 6855.37s]  All right.
[6855.37s -> 6855.93s]  You know what?
[6855.93s -> 6857.85s]  It's yeah, you didn't really have anything that great.
[6857.85s -> 6858.89s]  So fuck it.
[6860.66s -> 6862.26s]  All right.
[6862.26s -> 6866.66s]  Yeah, I didn't know that the rogue had a timer on his self either.
[6869.08s -> 6871.02s]  Well, OK.
[6871.02s -> 6872.30s]  Yeah, no, that was fun.
[6873.02s -> 6878.14s]  Vinny, if you're still around, I don't know what time frame you guys are both on,
[6878.14s -> 6881.74s]  but I'll be up for like at least another like four or five plus hours playing it.
[6881.74s -> 6882.38s]  Oh, my gosh.
[6883.42s -> 6886.62s]  Yeah, I might play because I streamed the direct and then Metroid Prime.
[6886.62s -> 6887.42s]  I'm getting a little tired.
[6887.42s -> 6889.82s]  So I'll tell you what, I'm probably going to play for like another hour.
[6889.82s -> 6891.62s]  But yeah, do your thing.
[6891.62s -> 6895.14s]  I know you have a bunch of people that want to check out the game with Friday, too.
[6895.14s -> 6897.86s]  I was planning on playing this Friday and maybe grabbing a couple of other people.
[6897.86s -> 6899.62s]  So anyone want to play on Friday, too?
[6899.62s -> 6900.34s]  Dang.
[6900.34s -> 6901.94s]  He's going all in.
[6901.94s -> 6903.06s]  Yeah, he's going all in.
[6903.06s -> 6904.02s]  I might be around.
[6904.02s -> 6904.74s]  Just hit me up.
[6904.74s -> 6906.18s]  Yeah, let's see.
[6906.18s -> 6906.50s]  All right.
[6906.50s -> 6910.46s]  See who's available in the group was as always good.
[6910.46s -> 6911.34s]  Stir.
[6911.34s -> 6913.02s]  Nice to game with you, gamer.
[6913.02s -> 6915.43s]  Yeah, nice to finally meet you for the first time.
[6915.43s -> 6916.23s]  You too, man.
[6916.23s -> 6916.87s]  I enjoyed this.
[6917.67s -> 6918.79s]  We'll game again sometime.
[6918.79s -> 6919.67s]  See you.
[6919.67s -> 6920.15s]  Yeah.
[6920.15s -> 6921.48s]  Take it easy, Vinny.
[6921.48s -> 6921.88s]  Bye.
[6921.88s -> 6925.11s]  Enjoy Metroid.
[6925.11s -> 6932.04s]  That's so funny that it's just like, oh, hey, by the way, it's out today.
[6932.04s -> 6933.88s]  I feel like that's the people are doing that.
[6933.88s -> 6934.84s]  Companies are doing that now.
[6935.48s -> 6936.84s]  What did Nintendo do?
[6936.84s -> 6937.56s]  What's out today?
[6938.65s -> 6942.73s]  Metroid Prime remaster was announced and came out today.
[6942.73s -> 6949.93s]  OK, so we've got to fill here.
[6949.93s -> 6953.46s]  I'm going to bring in Caleb.
[6953.46s -> 6954.34s]  Oh, I love Caleb.
[6956.92s -> 6961.64s]  Caleb, Caleb's in-game name is fucking crazy.
[6963.32s -> 6964.60s]  I don't even want to type this.
[6965.42s -> 6966.65s]  Who's Caleb?
[6966.65s -> 6967.15s]  Hold on.
[6973.46s -> 6975.38s]  I have to type it, so I'm going to type it.
[6975.38s -> 6978.15s]  Let me get him in here.
[6978.15s -> 6986.15s]  I add some.
[6986.15s -> 6995.96s]  Oh, here we go.
[6995.96s -> 6996.46s]  Yo.
[6997.21s -> 6999.11s]  Hello.
[6999.11s -> 7000.39s]  How goes it?
[7000.39s -> 7000.87s]  How are you?
[7000.87s -> 7002.31s]  Can you please introduce yourself?
[7002.31s -> 7005.27s]  Because people have no idea who I'm bringing into the game right now.
[7006.97s -> 7009.77s]  Yeah, my name is Jess Joles, and I'm really nobody.
[7009.77s -> 7013.46s]  But I work for somebody cool.
[7013.46s -> 7014.73s]  And that's why I'm at Germo.
[7017.77s -> 7018.73s]  That's all that matters.
[7019.29s -> 7020.49s]  I work for somebody.
[7020.49s -> 7022.49s]  Well, if everyone's saying who, who, who, who.
[7023.61s -> 7026.95s]  He can't talk about it because it's President Biden.
[7026.95s -> 7027.59s]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[7027.59s -> 7029.50s]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[7029.50s -> 7032.38s]  We actually invited him to the White House and Secret Service, basically.
[7034.30s -> 7035.02s]  Let me add you.
[7037.50s -> 7038.78s]  What's your name again?
[7040.22s -> 7040.94s]  Oh, God.
[7044.06s -> 7045.42s]  Like that, I think.
[7046.76s -> 7047.32s]  That's you.
[7047.80s -> 7051.48s]  You are awkward.
[7053.64s -> 7055.00s]  I don't even know how to.
[7055.64s -> 7057.00s]  We're just going to move on from that.
[7057.00s -> 7058.10s]  Yeah, we're just going to move on.
[7058.10s -> 7059.50s]  We're just going to move on.
[7059.50s -> 7061.26s]  You are a player, by the way.
[7061.26s -> 7062.92s]  Sterling, he's a player.
[7062.92s -> 7063.72s]  He's a player.
[7064.86s -> 7068.78s]  Okay, just to let you be aware, in case you bring any important items in,
[7068.78s -> 7073.10s]  my main strategy is running away as soon as anything bad happens.
[7073.10s -> 7075.98s]  And if you expect me to help you, I just want you to be aware that
[7075.98s -> 7077.82s]  I'm probably three rooms down.
[7077.82s -> 7079.08s]  Oh, perfect.
[7079.40s -> 7080.20s]  No, that's excellent.
[7080.20s -> 7081.80s]  I actually like getting all the kills.
[7082.60s -> 7084.12s]  He's a new player.
[7084.12s -> 7084.68s]  So am I.
[7084.68s -> 7086.94s]  I started literally two days ago.
[7086.94s -> 7087.50s]  Really?
[7087.50s -> 7087.82s]  Yeah.
[7087.82s -> 7089.10s]  I think we talked about this in the car.
[7089.10s -> 7091.02s]  I think we talked about this game and how I was like literally
[7091.02s -> 7092.70s]  just ranting and raving about this game.
[7092.70s -> 7092.94s]  Yeah.
[7092.94s -> 7093.66s]  So that's huge.
[7095.02s -> 7095.18s]  All right.
[7095.18s -> 7097.66s]  Let me bring my best gear so I can be sad that I lost it.
[7097.66s -> 7099.42s]  Oh, don't do that.
[7099.42s -> 7099.90s]  No, no, no.
[7099.90s -> 7100.86s]  I only have purples.
[7100.86s -> 7101.90s]  I only have purples.
[7101.90s -> 7103.11s]  What?
[7103.11s -> 7103.83s]  No, calm down.
[7103.83s -> 7104.39s]  Calm down.
[7104.39s -> 7104.95s]  Hold on.
[7104.95s -> 7105.59s]  You have.
[7105.59s -> 7105.75s]  All right.
[7105.75s -> 7106.63s]  We're going to get carried, Sterling.
[7106.63s -> 7107.75s]  This is going to be great.
[7107.75s -> 7108.31s]  No, no, no.
[7108.31s -> 7108.95s]  Calm down.
[7108.95s -> 7109.27s]  Wait, wait.
[7109.27s -> 7109.83s]  You're a ranger.
[7109.83s -> 7110.79s]  Wait, you're a ranger.
[7110.79s -> 7111.99s]  I'm a rogue.
[7111.99s -> 7112.79s]  Oh, my God.
[7112.79s -> 7113.59s]  That's so upsetting.
[7113.59s -> 7116.66s]  I have a purple bow.
[7116.66s -> 7117.70s]  In the car?
[7117.70s -> 7118.10s]  In the car.
[7118.10s -> 7119.40s]  What do you mean in the car?
[7119.40s -> 7119.88s]  When I.
[7119.88s -> 7120.36s]  OK.
[7120.36s -> 7125.00s]  When I was for tummy time, I had to hang out with a lot of really cool people
[7126.47s -> 7129.27s]  and just Jules was one of those people.
[7129.27s -> 7131.40s]  Well, I appreciate that.
[7131.40s -> 7132.68s]  I just happened to be there.
[7132.68s -> 7133.64s]  Right place, right time.
[7137.27s -> 7137.59s]  All right.
[7137.59s -> 7138.15s]  I am.
[7138.15s -> 7138.87s]  I'm good to go.
[7138.87s -> 7142.87s]  I'm geared up.
[7142.87s -> 7144.23s]  Actually, do you have a pendant?
[7144.23s -> 7144.71s]  Yeah.
[7144.71s -> 7145.27s]  Sorry.
[7145.27s -> 7145.83s]  I.
[7145.83s -> 7146.07s]  OK.
[7146.15s -> 7151.27s]  If you maybe I'll bring some some good shit because if you're going to actually
[7151.27s -> 7155.83s]  this is probably going to go pretty well because earlier we were doing some Facebook runs.
[7155.83s -> 7159.82s]  So it's good to have a quam kuzler.
[7159.82s -> 7161.10s]  That's you guys.
[7161.10s -> 7161.42s]  It's French.
[7161.42s -> 7161.98s]  It's French.
[7161.98s -> 7162.46s]  You guys.
[7162.46s -> 7165.02s]  Again, it's quam kuzler.
[7165.02s -> 7165.98s]  You guys are going to get along.
[7165.98s -> 7166.46s]  I already know.
[7166.46s -> 7168.57s]  So we're good.
[7168.57s -> 7171.27s]  It's going to be a family name.
[7171.27s -> 7172.55s]  I'm already fat fingering my all.
[7172.55s -> 7173.03s]  This is good.
[7182.14s -> 7183.78s]  Here we go.
[7183.78s -> 7187.24s]  So you're a barbarian and you I want to inspect you
[7187.24s -> 7191.00s]  because I want to see just how hard we're about to get carried here.
[7191.00s -> 7195.08s]  So the beauty about barbarian is once you hit level 15, all you need is a good axe
[7195.08s -> 7197.00s]  and I'll and just no thoughts.
[7197.00s -> 7198.20s]  You just hit people in the head.
[7198.20s -> 7199.58s]  That's all you do.
[7199.58s -> 7200.81s]  Come here.
[7200.81s -> 7201.69s]  Where are you?
[7201.69s -> 7202.25s]  I'm right here.
[7202.25s -> 7202.73s]  Can I inspect?
[7202.73s -> 7203.85s]  How do you can I inspect you?
[7203.85s -> 7206.36s]  How do I do that?
[7206.36s -> 7206.76s]  Yep.
[7206.76s -> 7209.08s]  I'll turn over and cough.
[7209.08s -> 7209.72s]  OK.
[7209.72s -> 7210.68s]  That's a big axe.
[7211.50s -> 7212.22s]  Yep.
[7212.22s -> 7212.46s]  Here.
[7212.46s -> 7213.42s]  I'll drop it for you here.
[7213.42s -> 7213.90s]  You want to see it?
[7213.90s -> 7214.30s]  Oh, my God.
[7214.30s -> 7215.42s]  That's scary.
[7215.42s -> 7215.90s]  Oh, my God.
[7215.90s -> 7216.78s]  This thing's crazy.
[7216.78s -> 7217.34s]  Oh, my God.
[7217.34s -> 7218.46s]  He dropped the axe.
[7218.46s -> 7218.86s]  Whoa.
[7218.86s -> 7219.10s]  OK.
[7219.66s -> 7220.62s]  What if I DC or something?
[7221.10s -> 7222.30s]  That's axe caliber.
[7224.15s -> 7225.59s]  I'll never I'm never speaking it.
[7225.59s -> 7226.07s]  I'm sorry.
[7226.07s -> 7227.59s]  Anyways, check this out.
[7227.59s -> 7227.91s]  Check this.
[7227.91s -> 7231.78s]  So these big screen big scary guys over here, right?
[7231.78s -> 7233.86s]  Also, my interact speed is awful.
[7233.86s -> 7235.46s]  But just watch this.
[7235.46s -> 7237.00s]  Just watch this.
[7237.00s -> 7237.64s]  Oh, hello.
[7238.86s -> 7244.34s]  We are essentially going to be and oh, my goodness.
[7244.34s -> 7245.14s]  OK, stir.
[7245.14s -> 7248.34s]  I hope you're ready to just kind of like collect items from people.
[7248.34s -> 7250.02s]  I mean, that's all I've been doing.
[7250.02s -> 7253.98s]  So I feel like this is a good even spread.
[7253.98s -> 7255.74s]  So paid actor.
[7256.12s -> 7257.24s]  Have you guys hit the dummy yet?
[7257.24s -> 7259.72s]  Like with the weapons and you like got your numbers
[7259.72s -> 7262.41s]  like to figure out your damage and all that.
[7262.41s -> 7264.66s]  I haven't gotten any numbers.
[7264.66s -> 7268.02s]  Well, it's kind of hard because the match starts so quickly.
[7268.02s -> 7268.50s]  Oh, yeah.
[7268.50s -> 7269.38s]  Oh, I sprint down there.
[7269.38s -> 7272.98s]  I literally pop my rage and I just like run down to the fucking the dummy
[7272.98s -> 7275.08s]  really as like quickly as possible.
[7275.08s -> 7281.70s]  So the average like arming sword does 30 damage and this axe does 160.
[7281.70s -> 7282.98s]  Oh, my God.
[7282.98s -> 7283.30s]  All right.
[7283.30s -> 7285.62s]  So you have two little brothers right now.
[7286.18s -> 7287.06s]  Essentially, what's going on?
[7287.46s -> 7288.98s]  That's always what I've wanted.
[7288.98s -> 7290.92s]  I will be torch guy.
[7290.92s -> 7291.24s]  Yeah.
[7291.24s -> 7292.73s]  Oh, oh, oh, God.
[7292.73s -> 7294.01s]  Yeah, yeah.
[7294.97s -> 7296.01s]  Dead in one hit.
[7296.01s -> 7296.81s]  Oh, my God.
[7296.81s -> 7298.01s]  I come to this nature.
[7298.01s -> 7300.81s]  I feel like this is an advertisement for the game.
[7300.81s -> 7301.93s]  Well, you could do this.
[7304.04s -> 7305.24s]  This is a very different game.
[7305.24s -> 7306.76s]  Archer up top Archer up top.
[7306.76s -> 7307.26s]  Mm hmm.
[7308.79s -> 7309.51s]  Uh, what Archer?
[7309.51s -> 7310.15s]  What Archer?
[7310.15s -> 7316.66s]  Should that hurt my bad boys?
[7316.66s -> 7318.10s]  I'll leave some mobs for you all.
[7318.10s -> 7318.58s]  Oh, my God.
[7318.58s -> 7320.23s]  There's skeletons here.
[7320.23s -> 7320.55s]  Help.
[7320.55s -> 7323.59s]  I mean, like, do I have to hit things to level though?
[7323.59s -> 7323.91s]  Yes.
[7323.91s -> 7324.23s]  Yes.
[7324.23s -> 7325.67s]  So I'm going to let I'm going to let you tap them.
[7325.91s -> 7327.03s]  I'm just going to kill them.
[7327.03s -> 7328.71s]  Just give them a little love tap.
[7328.71s -> 7329.83s]  Let me know you're there.
[7329.83s -> 7330.15s]  Yeah.
[7330.15s -> 7330.71s]  Good boys.
[7330.71s -> 7332.71s]  Good actor.
[7332.71s -> 7334.15s]  I got like credit for the kill.
[7334.15s -> 7335.11s]  If you carry me.
[7335.67s -> 7336.63s]  Beautiful boys.
[7336.63s -> 7337.35s]  That was excellent.
[7337.99s -> 7339.83s]  And you have a you have a page on E.
[7339.83s -> 7340.31s]  Oh, my God.
[7340.31s -> 7340.63s]  Crunchy.
[7340.63s -> 7341.67s]  E pal dot com.
[7344.15s -> 7346.87s]  I can buy a purple now, by the way, from that store.
[7346.87s -> 7349.78s]  I have I got two more crunchies.
[7349.78s -> 7351.14s]  A little meta gaming tips.
[7351.14s -> 7353.62s]  So if you find something that you like want to give to your friend,
[7353.62s -> 7354.66s]  don't leave it in the chest.
[7354.66s -> 7357.70s]  Just take it out and drag it out because the interact speed for other
[7357.70s -> 7358.66s]  players is trash.
[7358.66s -> 7361.78s]  Sometimes you actually both probably have rogues have the highest,
[7361.78s -> 7363.83s]  I think, other than Rangers.
[7363.83s -> 7366.47s]  Yeah, I'm Rogan.
[7366.47s -> 7372.10s]  I need boots or gloves or something.
[7372.10s -> 7373.70s]  Oh, excuse me.
[7373.70s -> 7374.50s]  I have a question.
[7374.50s -> 7374.82s]  Boots.
[7374.82s -> 7375.86s]  Do you have boots and gloves?
[7376.66s -> 7377.54s]  How do you get down here?
[7378.10s -> 7379.78s]  I have wondered the same thing.
[7379.78s -> 7380.18s]  Really?
[7380.18s -> 7381.62s]  You said we just know.
[7381.62s -> 7383.48s]  OK, you think I'd know.
[7383.48s -> 7385.00s]  But I actually you know what?
[7385.00s -> 7386.86s]  Hold on.
[7386.86s -> 7388.38s]  My senses are tingling.
[7388.38s -> 7391.10s]  I think if there's a lever somewhere.
[7391.10s -> 7393.80s]  Yeah, you can't break it.
[7393.80s -> 7394.12s]  I agree.
[7394.12s -> 7395.08s]  You can't like smash her.
[7395.16s -> 7397.72s]  If I had to guess, it's probably this door right here.
[7397.72s -> 7398.20s]  Watch this.
[7399.90s -> 7400.70s]  No shot, bro.
[7400.70s -> 7401.66s]  I'm a fucking wizard.
[7401.66s -> 7402.86s]  There's a gamer behind us.
[7404.06s -> 7404.94s]  Gamer behind us.
[7404.94s -> 7405.82s]  Where I am.
[7405.82s -> 7408.18s]  Can you kill him in one hit?
[7408.18s -> 7409.14s]  He's opening this door.
[7409.14s -> 7409.78s]  I'm invisible.
[7410.58s -> 7411.94s]  Let me let me let me.
[7411.94s -> 7412.58s]  Oh, yeah, you got him.
[7412.58s -> 7412.90s]  You got him.
[7412.90s -> 7416.73s]  You got him.
[7416.73s -> 7417.05s]  Yep.
[7417.05s -> 7417.29s]  Yep.
[7417.29s -> 7417.61s]  Boys.
[7417.61s -> 7417.85s]  Yep.
[7417.85s -> 7418.73s]  I didn't hit him.
[7418.73s -> 7419.13s]  I'm helping.
[7419.13s -> 7420.01s]  I'm helping.
[7420.01s -> 7420.33s]  All right.
[7420.33s -> 7420.89s]  The lights are off.
[7420.89s -> 7421.29s]  I can't see.
[7421.29s -> 7421.69s]  Oh, my God.
[7421.69s -> 7422.74s]  There's a mummy.
[7422.74s -> 7424.02s]  I lit it up.
[7424.02s -> 7425.14s]  I'm lighting it up.
[7425.14s -> 7426.26s]  I don't know how I didn't hit him.
[7429.70s -> 7430.74s]  I'm stunning the mummies.
[7435.48s -> 7436.68s]  That group is still over there, I think.
[7437.74s -> 7438.38s]  100 percent.
[7439.64s -> 7440.68s]  I'm creeping.
[7440.68s -> 7443.24s]  They're looking at us just playing musical chairs with the mummies,
[7443.24s -> 7444.84s]  and they're just like, oh, this is easy.
[7445.64s -> 7448.44s]  They probably saw your axe and probably just went, oh, shit.
[7450.54s -> 7451.10s]  They went.
[7451.10s -> 7452.30s]  Do you know what door they took?
[7452.30s -> 7454.38s]  There's beds in here if you guys want to take a nap.
[7454.38s -> 7454.78s]  Wait, wait.
[7454.78s -> 7456.22s]  I think they did the loop, de loop, and pull.
[7456.22s -> 7456.86s]  I think they went.
[7456.86s -> 7457.42s]  No, they didn't.
[7457.42s -> 7460.94s]  Hold on.
[7460.94s -> 7461.82s]  Friends, are you still there?
[7461.82s -> 7462.22s]  Still there.
[7462.22s -> 7462.62s]  I miss you.
[7462.62s -> 7464.47s]  I miss you.
[7464.47s -> 7468.15s]  I'd say we're just trying to find the portal if you've seen one.
[7469.72s -> 7470.52s]  Oh, we're in RP.
[7471.72s -> 7480.22s]  But why does everybody hate that voice?
[7480.22s -> 7481.50s]  It's not Stewie Griffin.
[7481.50s -> 7483.66s]  It's fucking somebody else.
[7483.66s -> 7486.36s]  It's it's like the Stanley parable.
[7486.36s -> 7489.96s]  Now, would either of you happen to have like any healing of anything?
[7492.25s -> 7493.85s]  If not, if not, don't worry about it.
[7493.85s -> 7494.57s]  It's fine.
[7494.57s -> 7496.73s]  No, I couldn't possibly need it.
[7496.73s -> 7498.33s]  I could possibly take it.
[7498.33s -> 7499.61s]  I got this full diapy.
[7499.61s -> 7508.38s]  Why?
[7509.50s -> 7509.98s]  There's not.
[7509.98s -> 7511.82s]  OK, let me just go over a few things.
[7511.82s -> 7516.46s]  There's not a single solitary reason for you to have said that right now for any reason.
[7518.30s -> 7520.94s]  There's not a single reason to say what you just said.
[7522.30s -> 7526.20s]  No, he was asking what we had.
[7526.20s -> 7531.94s]  So you have shit into a full you've shit into a diaper to fill it up is what you're telling us.
[7532.58s -> 7534.33s]  That's all you have.
[7534.33s -> 7535.29s]  It's loaded.
[7535.29s -> 7536.01s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[7536.01s -> 7536.57s]  Oh, my God.
[7536.57s -> 7537.45s]  There's healing right here.
[7537.45s -> 7538.25s]  Oh, my God.
[7538.25s -> 7539.21s]  Praise the heavens.
[7539.21s -> 7539.53s]  Nice.
[7541.78s -> 7542.82s]  And I just said it out.
[7542.82s -> 7543.62s]  You've ruined everything.
[7546.63s -> 7547.59s]  I'm sorry.
[7547.59s -> 7548.15s]  I'm dumb.
[7548.15s -> 7548.63s]  No, no, no, no.
[7548.63s -> 7550.79s]  Intelligence intelligence is six.
[7550.79s -> 7551.59s]  It's six.
[7551.59s -> 7552.07s]  Not you.
[7552.07s -> 7553.27s]  I'm talking about creepo, man.
[7554.07s -> 7555.50s]  Oh, there's a man.
[7555.50s -> 7556.70s]  There's a guy fighting spiders in there.
[7556.70s -> 7557.10s]  All right.
[7557.10s -> 7557.98s]  What about two people?
[7561.59s -> 7563.11s]  Hey, it's your last day on this planet.
[7566.82s -> 7571.48s]  Oh, my God.
[7572.04s -> 7575.80s]  I was a part of that.
[7578.06s -> 7578.62s]  No, you were.
[7578.62s -> 7579.74s]  You were an accessory.
[7579.74s -> 7583.50s]  If we all get charged for murder, it's all equally on us.
[7583.50s -> 7586.22s]  Yeah.
[7586.22s -> 7587.90s]  Oh, there's a suiander, too.
[7587.90s -> 7588.38s]  That was it.
[7588.38s -> 7589.10s]  Oh, boys, boys.
[7589.10s -> 7590.22s]  You're making mistakes.
[7590.22s -> 7590.54s]  All right.
[7590.54s -> 7590.94s]  Look at this.
[7590.94s -> 7591.50s]  Look at this.
[7591.50s -> 7592.30s]  Look at this, man.
[7592.30s -> 7593.34s]  Everybody inspect the rogue.
[7595.93s -> 7597.37s]  On this rogue was a ring.
[7597.37s -> 7597.77s]  OK.
[7597.77s -> 7598.81s]  You guys missed it.
[7598.81s -> 7600.65s]  This is a this is a common mistake.
[7600.65s -> 7602.01s]  Oh, demonize over here.
[7602.01s -> 7602.41s]  Yeah.
[7602.41s -> 7603.53s]  Don't miss rings.
[7603.53s -> 7604.33s]  Oh, my God.
[7604.33s -> 7605.61s]  And a necklace and a necklace.
[7605.61s -> 7606.01s]  Oh, my God.
[7606.01s -> 7608.52s]  This is an awful day.
[7608.52s -> 7610.57s]  Oh, happens.
[7610.57s -> 7611.85s]  Happens to the best of us.
[7611.85s -> 7613.62s]  I'm going to put on this suiander.
[7614.79s -> 7617.75s]  I mean, I said the typey thing, but I think suiander is worse.
[7617.75s -> 7618.79s]  So zwei handers.
[7618.79s -> 7620.23s]  Like, if you right click it, right click.
[7621.27s -> 7622.15s]  Not close to anybody.
[7622.15s -> 7622.55s]  Jesus.
[7622.55s -> 7623.05s]  What?
[7625.43s -> 7627.27s]  You literally helicopter around.
[7627.27s -> 7628.39s]  Oh, please, please, God.
[7628.39s -> 7628.87s]  No, please.
[7629.43s -> 7629.99s]  I don't know.
[7629.99s -> 7631.03s]  I just don't know.
[7631.03s -> 7631.51s]  Please.
[7631.51s -> 7632.07s]  I'm not going to do.
[7632.63s -> 7635.91s]  I'm not going to kill you as a joke.
[7635.91s -> 7637.99s]  No, I just I mean, you would.
[7638.15s -> 7641.58s]  But I not when you're decked out in purples.
[7641.58s -> 7645.82s]  If you have all these purples, there's no way I kill you for a joke.
[7645.82s -> 7649.50s]  I literally have on a gray armor and just this purple axe.
[7649.50s -> 7650.94s]  That's the barbed life.
[7650.94s -> 7652.70s]  That's the that's the whole thing right there.
[7653.26s -> 7653.74s]  Oh, my God.
[7653.74s -> 7654.54s]  A potion.
[7654.54s -> 7655.58s]  Oh, beautiful.
[7655.58s -> 7662.68s]  So you guys.
[7664.55s -> 7667.75s]  What if you say that like it's your last day on earth and then they kill you?
[7668.73s -> 7669.53s]  That doesn't happen.
[7669.53s -> 7672.65s]  That's never happened in my entire streaming career ever.
[7673.45s -> 7675.05s]  What if it does that?
[7675.05s -> 7677.21s]  I was thinking it's like what if he just gets like headshot by an arrow?
[7678.26s -> 7681.22s]  I have absolutely talked mad trash and gotten stopped before.
[7681.22s -> 7682.26s]  It's very upsetting.
[7682.26s -> 7683.94s]  I got a surgical kit.
[7683.94s -> 7684.82s]  All right, let's go.
[7684.82s -> 7687.96s]  Oh, you should take that.
[7687.96s -> 7691.59s]  Oh, where where where's that surgical kit?
[7691.59s -> 7693.51s]  Well, where I I'm holding it.
[7693.51s -> 7695.19s]  I don't want you to have it.
[7695.19s -> 7696.89s]  Let's go.
[7696.89s -> 7698.95s]  Beautiful.
[7698.95s -> 7700.79s]  I feel like you're already strong enough.
[7700.79s -> 7703.03s]  Like you really need to heal.
[7704.26s -> 7706.90s]  Well, if another barb hits me in the head, I'm definitely dead.
[7706.90s -> 7713.34s]  But, you know, honestly, I do get increased strength with lower lower strength.
[7713.34s -> 7714.22s]  Oh, sorry.
[7714.22s -> 7714.78s]  Lower health.
[7714.78s -> 7718.54s]  So if you do die, we need to we need to make sure we get that axe then.
[7718.54s -> 7719.10s]  Right?
[7719.10s -> 7720.06s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[7720.06s -> 7721.50s]  It's it's fine.
[7721.50s -> 7721.98s]  It's fine.
[7721.98s -> 7723.34s]  I'll I'll just cry about it.
[7724.06s -> 7726.84s]  I mean, that sounds cool.
[7728.58s -> 7730.18s]  Stir is such a Chad.
[7730.18s -> 7732.28s]  Somebody said that about Easter.
[7732.28s -> 7732.60s]  I don't know.
[7732.60s -> 7733.08s]  They just said it.
[7733.88s -> 7734.28s]  Okay.
[7734.28s -> 7737.80s]  Well, thank you for reading that comment instead of like the one guy who probably said
[7737.80s -> 7738.52s]  something negative.
[7740.12s -> 7741.40s]  It's a big moment.
[7741.40s -> 7742.52s]  Negative chats don't exist.
[7742.52s -> 7743.88s]  We just don't we just don't read those.
[7746.17s -> 7747.53s]  There's red portals over here.
[7748.73s -> 7750.73s]  Oh, those are those are evil.
[7750.73s -> 7751.13s]  I know.
[7751.13s -> 7754.33s]  But like I feel like you have a one shot kill axe.
[7754.33s -> 7757.05s]  I if you're scared of the red portal, I'm scared of the red portal.
[7757.05s -> 7757.45s]  I am.
[7757.45s -> 7759.21s]  I am indeed scared of the red portal.
[7759.21s -> 7760.25s]  I am a big.
[7760.25s -> 7760.97s]  I mean, I'll go.
[7760.97s -> 7761.53s]  I'll go.
[7761.53s -> 7766.04s]  But I mean, I mean, I've been I've been I've done it.
[7766.04s -> 7769.96s]  You know, I think it would be you versus the dungeon and we would just be running behind
[7769.96s -> 7771.78s]  you picking up things.
[7771.78s -> 7773.14s]  I think so.
[7773.14s -> 7776.74s]  What I would do is if I was going to go red dungeon, we would all have to be clerics and
[7776.74s -> 7780.10s]  we would just spam the heal spells to kill everything and then bring a bunch of camp
[7780.10s -> 7780.42s]  fires.
[7780.42s -> 7780.98s]  That's my met.
[7780.98s -> 7784.36s]  Oh, there's a blue portal if anybody wanted to guarantee their loot.
[7787.42s -> 7793.34s]  Did you I get hit by these all the time, too.
[7793.34s -> 7793.90s]  All right.
[7793.90s -> 7795.70s]  Are you guys looking for action?
[7795.70s -> 7796.42s]  You guys looking for loot?
[7796.42s -> 7797.30s]  What's the deal here?
[7797.30s -> 7800.90s]  I think I'd like to I have two crunchies and it lets me buy a purple.
[7800.90s -> 7802.34s]  So I and thanks for leaving.
[7802.34s -> 7803.14s]  I was good.
[7803.14s -> 7804.90s]  What do you have on you, sir?
[7804.90s -> 7805.70s]  A surgical kit.
[7806.26s -> 7807.14s]  There's a blue right there.
[7807.14s -> 7809.70s]  I have that three current three countries.
[7809.70s -> 7810.66s]  Oh, my God.
[7810.66s -> 7814.04s]  Oh, you're going to die to this right there.
[7814.04s -> 7815.88s]  I almost got you hit the axe again.
[7815.88s -> 7819.67s]  Yeah, I just do you right now.
[7819.67s -> 7821.59s]  I would say that would be kind of funny, but I hope you don't.
[7824.18s -> 7824.58s]  All right.
[7824.58s -> 7825.78s]  Yes, I got two crunchies.
[7826.58s -> 7828.76s]  So now what are you going to do?
[7828.76s -> 7831.35s]  Are you just let's watch?
[7832.23s -> 7834.02s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7834.02s -> 7836.74s]  Observe, observe not hitting these axes.
[7836.74s -> 7841.99s]  Watch this one, two, three feet like that every time.
[7841.99s -> 7844.49s]  How does he do it?
[7844.49s -> 7845.05s]  I don't know.
[7845.05s -> 7848.02s]  But there's four people, there's three people, four people.
[7848.02s -> 7850.10s]  And I think you are the one versus three, maybe.
[7850.10s -> 7852.60s]  Wait, I hear.
[7854.31s -> 7855.34s]  Hold on.
[7855.34s -> 7858.09s]  These boxes are in my way.
[7858.09s -> 7858.89s]  Pesky boxes.
[7862.14s -> 7862.46s]  Hmm.
[7868.47s -> 7870.15s]  Does that look funny in third person?
[7870.15s -> 7871.67s]  Yes, it kind of does.
[7871.67s -> 7872.38s]  Do you?
[7872.38s -> 7872.62s]  All right.
[7872.62s -> 7875.34s]  So there are three people left.
[7875.34s -> 7876.70s]  Are you one of them?
[7876.70s -> 7878.22s]  Like on the little indicator over there?
[7879.11s -> 7879.35s]  Yes.
[7879.99s -> 7881.27s]  OK, so good luck.
[7881.27s -> 7882.71s]  Where is the indicator?
[7882.71s -> 7883.99s]  We are getting out.
[7883.99s -> 7889.59s]  Above the map, all the filled in little columns or whatever,
[7889.59s -> 7890.47s]  those are people that are dead.
[7892.07s -> 7893.03s]  So you are the only one.
[7893.03s -> 7894.78s]  Somebody just died.
[7894.78s -> 7895.28s]  Let's go.
[7895.98s -> 7896.70s]  Nuts.
[7896.70s -> 7897.50s]  Awesome.
[7897.50s -> 7898.30s]  That's a dub, boys.
[7899.10s -> 7899.90s]  I'll take it.
[7899.90s -> 7901.94s]  So OK, very important.
[7903.06s -> 7906.42s]  I have 25 of those like Valentine's crunchies.
[7906.42s -> 7906.92s]  Yeah.
[7908.73s -> 7914.73s]  This is a big decision because I think I can afford to buy something crazy.
[7914.73s -> 7918.52s]  Yeah, so that's how I got this axe.
[7918.52s -> 7923.18s]  And I'll tell you, it was both the best and worst purchase of my life.
[7923.18s -> 7924.82s]  Why is that?
[7924.82s -> 7926.98s]  You know, like the gear hoarding syndrome,
[7926.98s -> 7929.86s]  like you get a bunch of gear, you just never use it because it's too nice.
[7929.86s -> 7930.90s]  It just sits in your stash.
[7930.90s -> 7932.26s]  Yeah, that's what I plan on doing.
[7933.35s -> 7935.59s]  Don't do that because we only have a week, but we have less than that now.
[7935.59s -> 7936.15s]  So.
[7936.15s -> 7940.33s]  Oh, but what if I'm going to lose it immediately?
[7940.33s -> 7940.89s]  I would buy this.
[7940.89s -> 7941.77s]  I'm going to make it back.
[7941.77s -> 7943.18s]  I'm going to make it back.
[7943.18s -> 7943.82s]  Don't be silly.
[7943.82s -> 7944.62s]  What should I get?
[7944.62s -> 7945.99s]  Treat yourself.
[7945.99s -> 7946.87s]  Well, what's in your merch?
[7949.66s -> 7951.66s]  Arming sword, which is too magic.
[7951.66s -> 7954.49s]  OK, so does magic damage work?
[7954.49s -> 7955.21s]  Not for you.
[7955.21s -> 7960.20s]  But that this is this is just this is dumb.
[7960.20s -> 7960.92s]  Um, let me see.
[7960.92s -> 7961.64s]  Let me see.
[7961.64s -> 7962.60s]  So you have arming sword.
[7962.60s -> 7965.56s]  You have a halberd is the halberd 30 or.
[7965.56s -> 7967.42s]  That's 30.
[7967.42s -> 7968.38s]  Have you tried the halberd?
[7968.38s -> 7969.26s]  I'm a fan.
[7969.26s -> 7970.62s]  Some people are not, though.
[7970.62s -> 7973.59s]  I prefer the one handers.
[7973.59s -> 7974.23s]  I see, I see.
[7974.23s -> 7976.62s]  I wish I get the mace.
[7976.62s -> 7980.73s]  Yeah, maces high key trash a lot of the times, in my opinion.
[7980.73s -> 7982.50s]  Well, what about like a hmm.
[7982.50s -> 7984.26s]  Yeah, but does this change?
[7984.26s -> 7986.09s]  Well, this will change in eight hours.
[7986.57s -> 7987.85s]  Yeah, it'll change.
[7987.85s -> 7990.73s]  Actually, you know what you can do, and this is this is meta gaming,
[7990.73s -> 7993.21s]  but I can check my merchant, too, and you can trade me the candies
[7993.21s -> 7995.05s]  and I can get you something and I can trade it back.
[7995.61s -> 7996.41s]  That's meta gaming.
[7996.41s -> 7997.37s]  I never mentioned that.
[7997.37s -> 7998.25s]  But let me check for you.
[7998.25s -> 7999.45s]  That's a really cool idea.
[7999.45s -> 8002.95s]  But this whole thing has been for you to take these and then leave the call.
[8002.95s -> 8005.11s]  Um, that's how that that sounded.
[8005.11s -> 8007.03s]  That sounded like an elaborate scam.
[8007.03s -> 8008.23s]  I would never see.
[8008.23s -> 8008.87s]  I'll take them.
[8008.87s -> 8009.35s]  I'll take them.
[8009.35s -> 8011.11s]  I'll go spend it and like I'll bring it back.
[8011.11s -> 8013.67s]  And then you just unfriend me on Discord and you leave.
[8013.67s -> 8015.26s]  And I never heard it ever again.
[8015.26s -> 8019.98s]  It's wild that I have this like purple rapier here with plus one physical damage,
[8019.98s -> 8022.70s]  plus one additional physical damage and plus one strength.
[8022.70s -> 8025.93s]  I would never do such a thing.
[8025.93s -> 8029.74s]  Um, I think I'll hold it because I want to I probably want to see what else is
[8029.74s -> 8031.66s]  because I like the one hander.
[8031.66s -> 8033.58s]  I don't I'm not like a rapier fan.
[8033.58s -> 8035.02s]  That's like you like poke, right?
[8035.02s -> 8036.66s]  It's like stab in front.
[8036.66s -> 8038.58s]  It's like some finesse.
[8038.58s -> 8040.10s]  It's got some finesse to it.
[8040.10s -> 8042.10s]  It's all it's more than poking, I'd say.
[8042.10s -> 8048.63s]  Sir, do you think I should do it or not?
[8048.63s -> 8050.79s]  Hey, he's always gone.
[8051.51s -> 8055.80s]  Uh, what what I was uh, I was getting a diapy change.
[8055.80s -> 8058.44s]  I think the powder god, you are killing me.
[8059.43s -> 8063.70s]  What are we going?
[8063.70s -> 8065.78s]  Wait, what's what's in your what's in your store?
[8065.78s -> 8066.66s]  What's in your valentine's?
[8066.66s -> 8068.02s]  What were you asking me?
[8068.02s -> 8069.22s]  Why did you need my attention?
[8070.18s -> 8072.26s]  He was asking you if you should if you should trust me.
[8072.26s -> 8074.74s]  Then you were you're out there doing adult things.
[8074.74s -> 8078.01s]  I don't in my store.
[8078.01s -> 8079.05s]  I'm confused.
[8079.05s -> 8082.97s]  I'll have you know that I I you got me paranoid.
[8083.53s -> 8088.09s]  The germa paranoia rubbed off on me and I did get some anti-worm medicine.
[8091.66s -> 8094.52s]  Yeah, I figured, you know, why not?
[8094.52s -> 8095.00s]  Why not?
[8095.00s -> 8096.12s]  Just in case.
[8096.12s -> 8098.82s]  Hey, facts.
[8100.74s -> 8102.90s]  I love how you don't know even what that is.
[8102.90s -> 8103.38s]  Oh, yeah.
[8103.38s -> 8103.86s]  Yeah, of course.
[8103.86s -> 8108.97s]  Like, you know, of course, who doesn't get anti-worm medication?
[8112.95s -> 8117.43s]  We had a brief discussion about health and wanting to always be cleanly and all that.
[8118.31s -> 8120.15s]  I just inferred it had something to do with that.
[8120.15s -> 8121.91s]  Yeah, but I do have no idea.
[8121.91s -> 8127.19s]  Absolutely all just completely flushed straight out into the diaper.
[8127.19s -> 8128.55s]  This is a weird one tonight.
[8130.09s -> 8131.45s]  Hey, man, I'm ready to go.
[8131.45s -> 8132.73s]  You're out here buying weapons.
[8132.73s -> 8134.57s]  I just look at my store.
[8134.57s -> 8138.97s]  No one can kill him and he just walks around like like what is this game?
[8138.97s -> 8141.29s]  Yeah, but I have to I have to put stuff in my inventory.
[8141.29s -> 8143.05s]  I have to sell the stuff I got.
[8143.05s -> 8145.53s]  Okay, so empty your inventory.
[8145.53s -> 8149.53s]  Okay, let's take off all your clothes.
[8149.53s -> 8151.43s]  Okay, you ready?
[8151.43s -> 8151.91s]  Yes.
[8151.91s -> 8154.73s]  Let's go ma no worms.
[8154.73s -> 8156.57s]  By the way, I brought a campfire.
[8157.13s -> 8158.42s]  Oh, good, good, good.
[8158.42s -> 8165.34s]  You can use the campfire not only to heal, but it also replenishes your abilities.
[8165.34s -> 8167.02s]  Yeah, that was we would ask that.
[8167.02s -> 8169.90s]  So is it all abilities or is it just some of them or?
[8169.90s -> 8170.62s]  Pretty much.
[8170.62s -> 8173.18s]  It's like it's like a DND short rest pretty much.
[8173.18s -> 8174.06s]  Yeah.
[8174.06s -> 8175.34s]  So you get some spell slots.
[8175.34s -> 8179.90s]  It's actually I'm really glad the whole pork arc happens because now I know that me
[8180.54s -> 8183.90s]  and my horse don't have worms and I definitely don't have COVID.
[8185.50s -> 8186.38s]  Your horse?

[8186.94s -> 8187.74s]  Hold on.
[8188.38s -> 8191.42s]  Did this just turn what is going on?
[8191.42s -> 8193.10s]  I need some sort of fill in here.
[8193.10s -> 8193.82s]  Maybe I don't.
[8193.82s -> 8195.50s]  No, I hear you stir.
[8195.50s -> 8197.42s]  Can I give him just this quick TLDR?
[8197.42s -> 8199.10s]  That was that was too deep of a joke.
[8199.10s -> 8199.34s]  I'm sorry.
[8199.34s -> 8201.03s]  Yeah, give him the TLDR.
[8201.03s -> 8205.72s]  So stir had it had a backpack and he had he went grocery shopping.
[8205.72s -> 8210.60s]  You know, those kind of ready made but raw meals like, oh, it's a pork chop and potatoes.
[8210.60s -> 8213.00s]  And it's just like kind of in the grocery store and you put it in the oven.
[8213.00s -> 8215.00s]  It's like a ready made thing for you just to put it in the oven.
[8215.00s -> 8218.55s]  He left it out for 16 hours accidentally.
[8218.55s -> 8220.76s]  Get a backpack on the floor.
[8220.76s -> 8221.51s]  All right.
[8221.51s -> 8223.03s]  You're going to want to talk to my wife about that.
[8227.08s -> 8228.62s]  Nah, wait, take this.
[8228.62s -> 8230.15s]  That's worth a lot of money.
[8230.15s -> 8231.67s]  She's trying to kill me, dude.
[8231.67s -> 8232.68s]  What?
[8233.40s -> 8235.56s]  Yeah, actually, who?
[8235.56s -> 8236.68s]  That's not a defrost.
[8236.68s -> 8241.58s]  That's like a that's like a re like that's making it wrong and like unhealthy.
[8241.58s -> 8247.99s]  We're going all like I was just hit him with the sword.
[8247.99s -> 8250.63s]  All right, boys.
[8250.63s -> 8252.07s]  I'm kind of a boxing match.
[8252.07s -> 8254.98s]  There's a guy down here.
[8254.98s -> 8255.38s]  Got him.
[8261.66s -> 8262.30s]  He's dead.
[8262.30s -> 8263.34s]  Oh, yes.
[8263.34s -> 8263.90s]  What do you got?
[8264.70s -> 8267.50s]  I actually have to I have to actually can't fire now.
[8267.50s -> 8272.14s]  I have the surgical kit with me either shield you want to go.
[8272.14s -> 8274.14s]  Yeah, I'll trade you the campfire for that.
[8274.14s -> 8275.10s]  I put it down.
[8275.10s -> 8275.74s]  Oh, my God.
[8275.74s -> 8280.12s]  Bless this man, sir.
[8280.12s -> 8284.22s]  Do you want I have a heater shield from that and a survival?
[8284.22s -> 8286.30s]  There's I don't need a weapon.
[8286.30s -> 8290.52s]  You realize if you go to you're going to like we run into a group of three.
[8290.52s -> 8292.44s]  I don't think I need a weapon is what I'm seeing.
[8296.49s -> 8299.21s]  Look at I move a bit faster while it's holstered.
[8299.53s -> 8300.17s]  Okay, so you're full.
[8300.81s -> 8301.05s]  All right.
[8301.05s -> 8301.45s]  You're good.
[8301.45s -> 8303.03s]  Yep.
[8303.03s -> 8307.43s]  Hey, Jeff, I would watch the confidence level here because it's so it's so simple to have
[8307.43s -> 8312.87s]  somebody have an equal amount of good gear on them and be an equally good player and
[8312.87s -> 8314.31s]  wipe the floor with the whole group.
[8314.31s -> 8316.15s]  I don't think anyone's better than.
[8321.96s -> 8322.60s]  All right, I'm leaving.
[8323.32s -> 8324.44s]  Give me give me your candy.
[8326.52s -> 8328.04s]  I just got hit twice.
[8328.04s -> 8329.56s]  You wanted to say it so bad.
[8330.52s -> 8332.92s]  Oh, my God, please take these, please.
[8335.70s -> 8336.34s]  What's your name again?
[8339.06s -> 8343.86s]  Because his name, the in game name like get educated.
[8343.86s -> 8346.50s]  I want to say it differently.
[8346.50s -> 8347.38s]  That's what I'm saying.
[8347.38s -> 8349.14s]  I know you say it that way.
[8349.14s -> 8349.54s]  I know.
[8349.54s -> 8350.74s]  So I had to check myself.
[8351.30s -> 8355.75s]  That's all I'm saying is I checked like the worms are getting to your brain.
[8355.75s -> 8356.71s]  There's no worms.
[8356.71s -> 8357.67s]  I dewormed.
[8358.31s -> 8359.03s]  Sure you did.
[8359.03s -> 8362.65s]  Now, oh, friends, we got friends.
[8365.00s -> 8366.20s]  Oh, God, he's a ranger.
[8366.20s -> 8366.92s]  He's a ranger.
[8366.92s -> 8369.16s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[8369.16s -> 8370.68s]  I just took my horse dewormer.
[8370.68s -> 8371.80s]  I can't go out like this.
[8373.40s -> 8376.12s]  I'm just going to hide over here for a second like this, dude.
[8376.12s -> 8377.48s]  Please, please.
[8377.48s -> 8378.20s]  I'm one hit.
[8378.20s -> 8378.68s]  Don't do it.
[8380.17s -> 8380.65s]  Are they coming?
[8380.65s -> 8381.13s]  I'm scared.
[8381.13s -> 8382.49s]  They are preparing.
[8383.77s -> 8384.65s]  Let's actually go for this.
[8384.65s -> 8385.53s]  I don't know how we do this.
[8385.53s -> 8386.73s]  Somebody has to open the door.
[8386.73s -> 8387.77s]  I'm going to run you.
[8387.77s -> 8388.65s]  I'm running you.
[8388.65s -> 8388.89s]  All right.
[8388.89s -> 8391.13s]  Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to pot up.
[8391.13s -> 8392.41s]  I'm going to I'm going to envis.
[8392.41s -> 8393.05s]  I'm going to envis.
[8395.72s -> 8397.24s]  And then you just you just run past me.
[8397.24s -> 8398.04s]  Just run past me.
[8398.04s -> 8398.60s]  I'll fuck him up.
[8398.60s -> 8398.84s]  OK.
[8399.48s -> 8401.21s]  Here, come over.
[8401.21s -> 8402.25s]  I'm invisible as well.
[8402.25s -> 8403.29s]  Oh, you're screwed.
[8403.29s -> 8403.93s]  Yeah, you're the only one.
[8403.93s -> 8405.61s]  They're turning off the only one.
[8405.61s -> 8406.57s]  I'll turn lights off, too.
[8406.57s -> 8407.05s]  Fuck that.
[8408.17s -> 8409.13s]  Yeah.
[8409.13s -> 8410.82s]  Who said you get there?
[8410.82s -> 8412.44s]  They're walking away.
[8412.44s -> 8413.24s]  They walk away.
[8413.80s -> 8414.84s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8414.84s -> 8415.80s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[8415.80s -> 8417.64s]  Even darkness is your ally.
[8417.64s -> 8419.94s]  I was born in it.
[8419.94s -> 8423.29s]  And you from the darkness should become blind.
[8423.29s -> 8427.67s]  That's pretty good.
[8427.67s -> 8428.54s]  All right.
[8428.54s -> 8429.66s]  I can do better.
[8429.74s -> 8430.30s]  Yeah.
[8430.30s -> 8433.30s]  Oh, you think the darkness is your ally?
[8433.30s -> 8434.54s]  My God.
[8434.54s -> 8435.90s]  You see the darkness now.
[8436.70s -> 8441.62s]  I believe that you and I will have a fight in the darkness.
[8441.62s -> 8442.90s]  Bruce Wayne.
[8444.36s -> 8445.32s]  Where's Rachel?
[8447.74s -> 8448.62s]  Where is she?
[8448.62s -> 8450.06s]  They're doing the same thing.
[8450.06s -> 8450.78s]  I just looked over there.
[8450.78s -> 8452.31s]  They're literally doing the same thing.
[8452.31s -> 8452.87s]  Oh, dude.
[8452.87s -> 8455.03s]  Well, they're the thing is they're bad.
[8455.03s -> 8455.51s]  We're good.
[8456.65s -> 8457.61s]  There's a difference.
[8457.61s -> 8458.49s]  Actually, I can't see.
[8458.49s -> 8461.14s]  Hold on.
[8461.14s -> 8462.02s]  It was kind of weird.
[8462.02s -> 8465.27s]  I'm going.
[8465.27s -> 8466.71s]  Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[8467.59s -> 8468.15s]  Going, going.
[8470.62s -> 8471.50s]  I'm doing alchemy.
[8474.63s -> 8475.43s]  Oh, he froze me.
[8478.06s -> 8478.54s]  Free tech.
[8480.71s -> 8481.19s]  One down.
[8481.91s -> 8487.00s]  It's so dark.
[8487.00s -> 8488.44s]  I don't know where I am.
[8488.44s -> 8489.48s]  Who's alive?
[8491.88s -> 8493.08s]  Oh, should I just hit you?
[8493.08s -> 8493.48s]  I just.
[8493.48s -> 8494.04s]  No.
[8494.04s -> 8494.52s]  Fuck.
[8494.52s -> 8495.88s]  Sterling, you killed me.
[8495.88s -> 8496.38s]  Sterling.
[8497.24s -> 8498.68s]  The darkness is your ally.
[8498.68s -> 8499.16s]  Oh, my God.
[8499.16s -> 8499.66s]  You killed him.
[8501.16s -> 8502.36s]  You just killed me.
[8502.36s -> 8504.44s]  Never turn off the lights again, you troglodyte.
[8504.44s -> 8505.08s]  Holy shit.
[8505.72s -> 8506.28s]  Wait, what?
[8506.28s -> 8507.96s]  Backwards and not swinging.
[8507.96s -> 8508.84s]  Saw you die.
[8508.84s -> 8510.36s]  And you're like, oh, it was stir.
[8511.32s -> 8512.60s]  I didn't, dude.
[8513.32s -> 8516.60s]  You hit in the back.
[8517.40s -> 8517.96s]  It's cool.
[8525.18s -> 8525.98s]  Pervert.
[8525.98s -> 8527.82s]  With your sweet hander.
[8529.05s -> 8530.09s]  Oh, my goodness.
[8530.65s -> 8531.85s]  That was so scary.
[8531.85s -> 8533.85s]  I thought I honestly thought you were going to die in there.
[8534.81s -> 8536.17s]  It goes lair.
[8536.17s -> 8537.37s]  Do you want to camp?
[8539.27s -> 8540.79s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8540.79s -> 8541.29s]  100%.
[8543.61s -> 8544.66s]  All right.
[8544.66s -> 8545.22s]  I killed.
[8545.22s -> 8546.82s]  Hey, I did get a full.
[8546.82s -> 8549.69s]  I killed somebody in the very beginning.
[8549.69s -> 8550.25s]  I helped.
[8550.25s -> 8552.49s]  And then I may have hit you in the rib cage.
[8553.29s -> 8557.54s]  To be fair, the lights were off and they turned on.
[8557.54s -> 8558.82s]  And it was just people around me.
[8558.82s -> 8560.10s]  And I didn't know who was who.
[8562.10s -> 8563.38s]  I turned on the light.
[8563.38s -> 8566.57s]  I was holding the torch.
[8567.21s -> 8568.81s]  I was giving you light.
[8568.81s -> 8571.85s]  And then you hit your ally and then blamed your other ally.
[8571.85s -> 8573.93s]  I thought you were just killing me.
[8573.93s -> 8575.05s]  How dare you turn on the lights?
[8575.05s -> 8575.85s]  That's why I hit him.
[8576.82s -> 8578.02s]  The first thing I saw.
[8578.02s -> 8578.74s]  I couldn't see.
[8579.86s -> 8581.94s]  As soon as I could see, I just started swinging.
[8584.42s -> 8588.10s]  The first thing I did when my vision came back was blindly swing in a circle.
[8588.10s -> 8590.34s]  But wait, there's context behind this.
[8590.34s -> 8590.98s]  I'm sorry.
[8592.02s -> 8596.42s]  It was six people in the same tiny little fucking area.
[8596.42s -> 8598.50s]  And the lights were all off.
[8598.50s -> 8600.10s]  So it's like, I don't know who lived it.
[8600.10s -> 8601.30s]  I know one of them died.
[8601.30s -> 8602.90s]  I didn't know that it's hard to see.
[8602.90s -> 8604.10s]  I know that maybe two of them died.
[8604.10s -> 8605.86s]  When the lights came back on, people are still swinging.
[8605.86s -> 8606.42s]  I'm like, wait a minute.
[8606.42s -> 8607.62s]  We might be hitting each other.
[8607.62s -> 8608.98s]  I hit you accidentally.
[8608.98s -> 8610.34s]  And then apologies.
[8610.34s -> 8612.18s]  I thought stir was just stabbing me in the face.
[8612.98s -> 8613.30s]  All right.
[8613.30s -> 8614.66s]  This is the wrong room.
[8614.66s -> 8616.10s]  Oh, no, not today.
[8616.10s -> 8616.82s]  Not today.
[8616.82s -> 8619.13s]  Oh, but you almost just got wrecked.
[8621.13s -> 8621.85s]  Yeah, yeah.
[8623.86s -> 8626.34s]  If I don't turn around quick enough, I will accidentally swing on you.
[8626.42s -> 8628.50s]  We got to I think if I'm not mistaken.
[8628.50s -> 8628.82s]  Hold on.
[8628.82s -> 8632.47s]  I mean, let me just kind of loud.
[8632.47s -> 8633.35s]  Is this a little loud?
[8635.10s -> 8636.22s]  Is that echoing?
[8636.22s -> 8637.18s]  No, you're good.
[8637.18s -> 8637.98s]  Does anyone hear us?
[8639.10s -> 8639.60s]  All right.
[8641.72s -> 8642.68s]  Come with me.
[8642.68s -> 8649.08s]  I think I think there might be like I come with you or qualm with you.
[8649.08s -> 8653.16s]  I was about to be over the I was going to go over comms and yell at you.
[8653.16s -> 8655.48s]  I was going to be like, stop team killing, team killing, team killing.
[8655.48s -> 8657.72s]  But that guy would have been like, what is this fucking kid talking about?
[8659.16s -> 8660.76s]  That's a good strategy.
[8660.76s -> 8662.12s]  Oh, no, this is awful.
[8662.12s -> 8663.38s]  All right.
[8663.38s -> 8664.82s]  I followed you to the grave.
[8664.82s -> 8665.22s]  I know.
[8665.22s -> 8665.94s]  I know.
[8665.94s -> 8666.90s]  It'll be okay.
[8666.90s -> 8667.46s]  You're being dramatic.
[8668.94s -> 8674.18s]  Oh, and here's a cleric trying to get a cheeky kill on me.
[8674.18s -> 8679.91s]  Oh, he died to a spike.
[8679.91s -> 8680.55s]  He was beautiful.
[8680.55s -> 8681.59s]  Wait, watch out.
[8681.59s -> 8683.51s]  I dropped caltrops on these stairs.
[8683.51s -> 8684.23s]  Oh, good.
[8684.23s -> 8687.05s]  He almost got used to her.
[8687.05s -> 8688.01s]  But he didn't.
[8688.01s -> 8688.89s]  It was calculated.
[8689.61s -> 8690.25s]  I don't know where they.
[8690.25s -> 8691.05s]  Oh, I see them now.
[8691.05s -> 8692.17s]  I got to go.
[8692.17s -> 8693.93s]  This game is so good.
[8693.93s -> 8694.57s]  It really is.
[8698.14s -> 8698.62s]  I don't.
[8699.26s -> 8699.50s]  All right.
[8699.50s -> 8700.70s]  I have these Heelys.
[8700.70s -> 8702.38s]  Oh, and I have another campfire.
[8702.38s -> 8703.10s]  Can you set this down?
[8703.10s -> 8706.86s]  Because I literally have the interaction speed of a walrus with no flippers.
[8709.42s -> 8709.90s]  Don't ask.
[8710.62s -> 8711.90s]  How long does it take for you?
[8711.90s -> 8715.90s]  That translates to when you do medical wraps and stuff, too.
[8715.90s -> 8716.06s]  Right.
[8716.06s -> 8716.30s]  Yeah.
[8716.30s -> 8716.78s]  Yeah.
[8716.78s -> 8717.42s]  You see this?
[8717.42s -> 8719.18s]  You see this?
[8719.18s -> 8721.82s]  I might as well be like rubbing my wounds with sandpaper.
[8721.82s -> 8724.36s]  It's so long.
[8724.36s -> 8726.36s]  I actually haven't like measured it out.
[8726.36s -> 8731.72s]  But like, what's your resourcefulness level or your attribute?
[8731.72s -> 8733.43s]  Because mine's 10.
[8733.43s -> 8734.23s]  Oh, my God.
[8734.23s -> 8734.71s]  That's low.
[8735.67s -> 8735.91s]  Yeah.
[8735.91s -> 8738.39s]  You know, big dumb and big bad.
[8738.39s -> 8738.71s]  Wow.
[8738.71s -> 8740.98s]  In my hands, basically.
[8740.98s -> 8741.94s]  32 strength, though.
[8741.94s -> 8743.62s]  That's pretty good, isn't it?
[8743.62s -> 8743.86s]  Yeah.
[8743.86s -> 8744.42s]  Yeah, it's nuts.
[8745.77s -> 8746.81s]  Do you not like lights?
[8747.69s -> 8749.61s]  What is up with you in turning off everything?
[8749.61s -> 8750.73s]  You are turning all the lights off.
[8750.73s -> 8754.42s]  Once shit goes down, I want to be able to go invisible in a corner.
[8754.42s -> 8757.90s]  You can do that with lights, though.
[8757.90s -> 8758.38s]  Can you?
[8758.94s -> 8759.18s]  Yes.
[8759.82s -> 8761.02s]  You just stealth anywhere?
[8761.02s -> 8762.22s]  This game's super unrealistic.
[8762.22s -> 8762.94s]  Yes.
[8762.94s -> 8763.18s]  Yeah.
[8763.18s -> 8763.98s]  As a rogue.
[8763.98s -> 8764.86s]  Not the magical.
[8767.03s -> 8769.35s]  This I'm like wondering why the heck you're turning off.
[8769.35s -> 8773.03s]  I can't see what I'm hitting when you when you interact so quickly.
[8773.03s -> 8773.83s]  Why not?
[8773.83s -> 8775.43s]  Oh, you know, that must be nice.
[8775.43s -> 8775.67s]  Yeah.
[8775.67s -> 8775.91s]  Watch this.
[8775.91s -> 8776.31s]  Watch this.
[8776.31s -> 8777.59s]  Watch you go turn off one.
[8777.59s -> 8778.47s]  Oh, this is a portal over here.
[8778.47s -> 8779.19s]  Beautiful.
[8779.19s -> 8779.98s]  Oh, no.
[8779.98s -> 8780.22s]  No.
[8780.22s -> 8781.10s]  These are players.
[8781.10s -> 8781.58s]  Oh, no.
[8781.58s -> 8782.22s]  This is a bad time.
[8782.22s -> 8783.58s]  See, this is where I'm running.
[8783.58s -> 8785.05s]  Now, this makes sense.
[8785.05s -> 8785.61s]  You run.
[8785.61s -> 8786.81s]  I will run, too.
[8786.81s -> 8787.85s]  I'll catch up.
[8787.85s -> 8788.09s]  Yep.
[8788.09s -> 8789.26s]  Yep.
[8789.26s -> 8791.19s]  See, I open that door.
[8791.19s -> 8791.91s]  I can't do that.
[8793.22s -> 8794.02s]  I can close them.
[8794.02s -> 8795.62s]  There's a there's a wraith in here.
[8796.58s -> 8797.14s]  Yeah.
[8797.14s -> 8798.10s]  Oh, God.
[8798.18s -> 8799.14s]  Just just just run.
[8799.14s -> 8805.75s]  Just run.
[8805.75s -> 8808.15s]  I must I must save this V hander.
[8808.15s -> 8809.34s]  All right, dude.
[8809.34s -> 8809.98s]  Yeah.
[8809.98s -> 8815.96s]  Oh, I shut the door on you a little.
[8815.96s -> 8817.24s]  It takes me five years to open this.
[8817.24s -> 8817.80s]  I hope you know.
[8817.80s -> 8818.68s]  You killed the man today.
[8819.48s -> 8820.76s]  You killed the Coom today.
[8820.76s -> 8821.72s]  You killed the Coom today.
[8821.72s -> 8822.68s]  I hope you know you did that.
[8822.68s -> 8823.56s]  Do you need it open?
[8823.56s -> 8824.28s]  I can open it.
[8824.28s -> 8824.60s]  No, no.
[8824.60s -> 8825.72s]  It's too late, dude.
[8825.72s -> 8826.28s]  I opened it.
[8826.28s -> 8828.86s]  Oh, no.
[8828.86s -> 8829.98s]  You killed the man today.
[8829.98s -> 8831.26s]  He's dead.
[8831.26s -> 8832.62s]  Sir, are you going to go get that fucking axe?
[8832.62s -> 8833.58s]  You killed the man today.
[8833.58s -> 8834.38s]  You killed the man today.
[8834.38s -> 8836.62s]  Sir, you killed the man today.
[8836.62s -> 8837.66s]  Don't even bother.
[8837.66s -> 8838.30s]  It's not worth it.
[8838.30s -> 8838.94s]  It's not worth it.
[8840.94s -> 8842.06s]  I can't believe it.
[8842.06s -> 8843.26s]  What are you doing?
[8843.26s -> 8844.86s]  Sir, what have you done?
[8846.66s -> 8847.46s]  Damn it.
[8847.46s -> 8848.18s]  It could have been us.
[8849.14s -> 8849.86s]  That could have been us.
[8850.50s -> 8851.78s]  All you had to do was fight them.
[8853.93s -> 8856.57s]  I I don't I'm not a part of this.
[8859.54s -> 8860.18s]  And you know what?
[8860.18s -> 8862.50s]  The worst part is we lost the Zwei hander.
[8862.50s -> 8864.10s]  You lost the Zwei hander, too.
[8864.10s -> 8865.86s]  Ah, we lost the Zwei hander.
[8867.19s -> 8869.67s]  Is there anywhere to know where portals
[8869.67s -> 8870.31s]  are appearing?
[8871.24s -> 8875.08s]  It's random and there's only enough for like one or two of you to get out.
[8876.62s -> 8880.06s]  They are random in this circle and there's only enough for maybe one more of you to leave.
[8881.10s -> 8881.58s]  There it is.
[8882.84s -> 8884.76s]  Wow, how poetic, too, just for us.
[8884.76s -> 8885.80s]  What do you have in your inventory?
[8886.44s -> 8888.60s]  Hey, I'm glad you got out of here with the ancient scroll.
[8891.56s -> 8898.30s]  We killed you.
[8899.48s -> 8901.00s]  Yeah, that's amazing.
[8902.84s -> 8906.73s]  Well, that was well back to remember our carry.
[8907.53s -> 8908.81s]  Well, now you don't have the weapon.
[8909.45s -> 8910.65s]  OK, that's beautiful.
[8910.65s -> 8911.37s]  I have multiple.
[8914.33s -> 8914.89s]  Wait, hold on.
[8914.89s -> 8918.71s]  Do you have like a whole closet of like Peter Griffin shirts?
[8918.71s -> 8920.31s]  Yeah, it's yeah.
[8920.31s -> 8921.59s]  Oh, I stay.
[8921.59s -> 8922.87s]  I keep that thing on me.
[8922.87s -> 8923.51s]  Oh, OK.
[8925.78s -> 8926.84s]  All right.
[8926.84s -> 8928.30s]  What do you think this is?
[8928.30s -> 8928.78s]  That's cool.
[8928.78s -> 8929.34s]  That's good.
[8929.34s -> 8930.06s]  Yeah, that works.
[8932.07s -> 8933.51s]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[8933.51s -> 8934.23s]  Actually, I have.
[8935.35s -> 8935.99s]  Oh, I know.
[8935.99s -> 8937.59s]  Wait, you're a rogue, right?
[8937.59s -> 8939.19s]  Oh, God, if you hadn't screwed me over.
[8939.19s -> 8942.31s]  I have like this nice blue stiletto dagger that I could give you.
[8943.96s -> 8944.20s]  Me?
[8945.82s -> 8949.02s]  The guy who left you to die.
[8949.02s -> 8950.65s]  What do you mean me?
[8950.65s -> 8952.57s]  Are you live right now, by the way?
[8952.57s -> 8953.13s]  Yes, yes.
[8953.13s -> 8954.33s]  Just in case people want to see your perspective.
[8954.33s -> 8954.89s]  I'm sorry.
[8954.89s -> 8956.89s]  I was ignoring you and reading a text message.
[8956.89s -> 8958.89s]  So I like only heard me.
[8960.63s -> 8961.11s]  You know what?
[8961.11s -> 8965.35s]  I hope that your horse dewormer was left out for 16 hours as well.
[8967.19s -> 8968.71s]  It almost made me want to throw up.
[8968.71s -> 8970.07s]  So it might as well have been.
[8970.87s -> 8974.79s]  This is a what an unbelievably strange conversation.
[8975.98s -> 8976.38s]  It's OK.
[8976.38s -> 8979.05s]  Rene, what's your Twitch?
[8979.05s -> 8984.14s]  It's just Joel's J-U-S-T-J-O-E-L-S.
[8984.14s -> 8987.75s]  So if you want to see the game or perspective.
[8987.75s -> 8988.39s]  They don't want that.
[8988.39s -> 8990.22s]  Some people do.
[8990.22s -> 8995.91s]  Some people like games.
[8995.91s -> 8996.15s]  All right.
[8996.15s -> 8998.63s]  Well, that was a fun one.
[8999.43s -> 9000.15s]  I had a good time.
[9001.10s -> 9001.74s]  Yeah.
[9001.74s -> 9003.56s]  Let's go again.
[9003.56s -> 9004.44s]  Yeah, let's run it.
[9004.68s -> 9011.40s]  But I have a necklace that I'm going to bring you so you can stay geared up.
[9011.40s -> 9012.68s]  I would recheck your shop.
[9012.68s -> 9014.66s]  Sometimes it does switch up.
[9014.66s -> 9015.16s]  Yeah.
[9016.50s -> 9018.10s]  Even when the timer is not up?
[9018.10s -> 9018.34s]  Yeah.
[9018.34s -> 9018.50s]  Yeah.
[9018.50s -> 9020.02s]  Sometimes it just randomly switches up.
[9020.02s -> 9021.54s]  I don't know why the timer is there.
[9021.54s -> 9022.18s]  I got to be honest.
[9032.78s -> 9033.66s]  It looks at the same.
[9033.66s -> 9035.06s]  I'll check it later.
[9035.06s -> 9036.10s]  I'll check it tomorrow, whatever.
[9036.66s -> 9038.58s]  Honestly, I might even be live during this.
[9039.78s -> 9040.74s]  Actually, probably not.
[9040.74s -> 9041.54s]  Let me think about it.
[9043.88s -> 9044.60s]  I'm going to bring.
[9045.46s -> 9048.95s]  I'm going to just bring like a decent one.
[9048.95s -> 9055.30s]  Yeah, I don't want to bring it in my blues.
[9055.30s -> 9055.70s]  I know.
[9055.70s -> 9056.58s]  I know.
[9056.58s -> 9057.14s]  Don't hoard.
[9057.14s -> 9057.78s]  Don't hoard.
[9057.78s -> 9058.66s]  Don't hoard it.
[9058.66s -> 9060.57s]  But it's nice to look at.
[9060.57s -> 9063.69s]  Okay, it's nice to be able to open my stash and look at all this money and go, wow, look
[9063.69s -> 9064.09s]  at that sword.
[9064.09s -> 9064.73s]  Look at those boots.
[9064.73s -> 9068.63s]  Look at that sword.
[9068.63s -> 9069.67s]  Listen to me, Jeremy.
[9069.67s -> 9072.55s]  If you don't bring a blue or like multiple blues with you, I'm just going to team kill
[9072.55s -> 9073.35s]  you when we get in here.
[9073.35s -> 9076.07s]  So the choice is yours at this point.
[9076.07s -> 9078.82s]  Bring the blues or suffer the consequences.
[9078.82s -> 9081.38s]  If you don't bring the blues, I'm going to shut that door in your face.
[9081.38s -> 9082.58s]  What the fuck?
[9082.58s -> 9084.26s]  I'm going to leave your dinner out for 16 hours.
[9084.26s -> 9084.90s]  How about that, pal?
[9085.78s -> 9086.92s]  Okay, what if I bring?
[9089.56s -> 9092.04s]  I need you to like strip down when we get in the lobby.
[9092.04s -> 9092.36s]  I got it.
[9092.36s -> 9092.68s]  I got it.
[9092.68s -> 9093.08s]  I got it.
[9093.08s -> 9096.63s]  I'm bringing a good item.
[9096.63s -> 9099.34s]  Two, at least.
[9099.34s -> 9100.46s]  That was the arrangement.
[9100.46s -> 9102.02s]  Okay.
[9102.02s -> 9103.70s]  I do have two good items on.
[9104.42s -> 9106.02s]  This thing is actually really good.
[9106.02s -> 9108.23s]  Whoever gets this, congratulations.
[9113.21s -> 9117.53s]  It's a different colored item.
[9117.53s -> 9122.22s]  It's a different like rarity than just the simple, the common.
[9122.22s -> 9122.94s]  Beautiful, beautiful.
[9122.94s -> 9123.42s]  Yeah, so we're good.
[9123.42s -> 9124.30s]  I like to hear that.
[9124.30s -> 9124.86s]  All right, let's go.
[9128.04s -> 9128.68s]  Yeah, let's go.
[9128.68s -> 9143.37s]  Term it ends in a few days.
[9145.00s -> 9147.99s]  Yeah, we don't acknowledge it.
[9147.99s -> 9148.95s]  It's not real.
[9148.95s -> 9153.03s]  Just people saying that what may is when it might be coming back.
[9155.85s -> 9158.33s]  If they do a fifth play test, that's kind of wild.
[9158.33s -> 9160.65s]  I don't know what else they would add other than like other areas,
[9160.65s -> 9163.93s]  kind of like in Tarkov, like you have like storage factory and all that.
[9163.93s -> 9166.25s]  And so it's going to go into open beta.
[9166.25s -> 9169.53s]  Or I mean, are they going to how much is it going to be free to play?
[9169.53s -> 9170.57s]  Are they going to charge for it?
[9170.57s -> 9172.95s]  Like, I wonder what their plan is.
[9172.95s -> 9174.31s]  I would gladly pay money for this.
[9174.31s -> 9176.63s]  And if they don't charge for it, I will still pay money for this.
[9176.95s -> 9178.54s]  Yeah.
[9178.54s -> 9179.90s]  All right, team killer.
[9179.90s -> 9182.23s]  Here you go.
[9182.23s -> 9183.67s]  No, that's not you're not team killer.
[9183.67s -> 9185.45s]  No, no, that's that's not you.
[9185.45s -> 9188.25s]  OK, this is this is for you.
[9188.25s -> 9189.85s]  I just want to see what that internet.
[9189.85s -> 9192.34s]  Hey, how come we're picking up chalices all the time?
[9192.34s -> 9195.22s]  There's a bunch of chalices on this table, but I can't pick up these chalices.
[9195.22s -> 9197.14s]  Hey, sir, you actually take this.
[9197.14s -> 9198.34s]  Maybe the table is broken.
[9198.34s -> 9199.14s]  Hold on.
[9199.14s -> 9203.05s]  Sir, you're going to want to wait.
[9203.05s -> 9205.13s]  That's how you should kind of hold on.
[9205.13s -> 9207.46s]  Oh, you brought me the blue.
[9207.46s -> 9208.02s]  Yeah.
[9208.02s -> 9209.70s]  So now we won't team kill us.
[9209.70s -> 9212.58s]  That's that's that's what team team works all about.
[9212.74s -> 9214.82s]  Teamwork, teamwork.
[9214.82s -> 9216.98s]  That does like a lot more damage.
[9217.54s -> 9217.78s]  Yeah.
[9217.78s -> 9221.86s]  So that right click, honestly, the stiletto combo is the best combo from what I remember.
[9222.42s -> 9223.30s]  Don't don't even.
[9223.30s -> 9224.18s]  Yeah, don't even mess.
[9224.18s -> 9225.54s]  Yeah, just just that right there.
[9225.54s -> 9226.90s]  You're going to just wax.
[9226.90s -> 9229.27s]  Hey, try it on my face.
[9229.27s -> 9229.59s]  Yeah.
[9229.59s -> 9230.23s]  Yep.
[9230.23s -> 9232.89s]  Well, I mean, I could try it on a zombie face.
[9234.57s -> 9235.85s]  We actually probably should go.
[9235.85s -> 9236.95s]  Oh, no, we can't.
[9236.95s -> 9238.07s]  This guy is dying for us.
[9238.07s -> 9239.03s]  That's so sweet.
[9239.03s -> 9241.24s]  Oh, what a swell guy.
[9241.24s -> 9241.80s]  Pretty sick.
[9242.36s -> 9244.30s]  Hey, can we start a potion?
[9244.54s -> 9249.30s]  Nice guy lights off real quick lights off.
[9250.20s -> 9251.16s]  Honestly, I was kind of upset.
[9251.16s -> 9254.18s]  I could see the game for a second.
[9254.18s -> 9257.22s]  You got to take a cat's eye potion.
[9257.22s -> 9258.50s]  How many subs to take out?
[9258.50s -> 9259.94s]  One hundred, one hundred subs.
[9259.94s -> 9261.54s]  I'll team kill German immediately.
[9261.54s -> 9262.34s]  Someone's going to do that.
[9262.34s -> 9263.38s]  I just I hope you understand.
[9263.38s -> 9264.50s]  That's going to happen in like five seconds.
[9268.44s -> 9272.20s]  This is no, no, no, no, we're not paying that.
[9272.20s -> 9273.56s]  No, no, I have nothing to do with this.
[9279.58s -> 9282.06s]  That would be that would be unbelievable.
[9282.06s -> 9285.90s]  And let me tell you something, by the way, the guy trapped in the electric chair.
[9286.30s -> 9287.18s]  I have nothing to do with it.
[9287.18s -> 9291.10s]  Oh, yeah, I'm going over this right now.
[9291.10s -> 9295.90s]  I got shit for spending seventy five bucks on the fucking family guy mobile game.
[9295.90s -> 9299.74s]  If you spend five hundred bucks on killing me in this game.
[9300.79s -> 9301.83s]  Excuse me.
[9301.83s -> 9302.63s]  What do you think?
[9302.63s -> 9306.34s]  I have fruit fruitless fucking expenses.

[9337.30s -> 9340.50s]  Jeremy, I can't believe you spent like 70 bucks on that game.
[9340.50s -> 9342.58s]  That's like what a bad purchase.
[9342.58s -> 9344.10s]  Hey, hey, hey, other streamer.
[9344.10s -> 9345.54s]  Here's five hundred.
[9346.34s -> 9346.98s]  Oh, Jesus.
[9348.76s -> 9350.28s]  Somebody paid this motherfucker.
[9350.28s -> 9350.92s]  Somebody paid him.
[9359.74s -> 9363.50s]  Did you actually get somebody actually give you what I just saw?
[9363.50s -> 9364.70s]  I just saw him take you down.
[9364.70s -> 9366.30s]  I just I felt compelled to do it.
[9366.30s -> 9366.94s]  Like now.
[9366.94s -> 9367.50s]  Oh, my God.
[9367.50s -> 9368.62s]  What have I done?
[9368.62s -> 9371.02s]  Now you're alone and you're not.
[9371.02s -> 9373.18s]  You're alone and you've got a really good axe.
[9373.18s -> 9376.14s]  And I hope you got a whole fucking closet of Peter Griffin shirts because that one's
[9376.14s -> 9377.98s]  gone to listen.
[9377.98s -> 9381.29s]  Listen, I didn't do it for the money.
[9381.29s -> 9387.88s]  Ethan, I did it for the club to be able to say that I'm a virtual assassin.
[9387.88s -> 9390.44s]  Yeah, I've got a paid hit job on my record.
[9390.44s -> 9391.56s]  Oh, my God.

[9396.41s -> 9399.94s]  Well, you also are potentially going against multiple.
[9399.94s -> 9402.07s]  Is this a blue or is this purple?
[9402.07s -> 9403.11s]  Oh, this is a perp.
[9404.07s -> 9405.75s]  You can press tab to inspect my inventory.
[9405.75s -> 9407.19s]  You can see the drip I got on.

[9408.31s -> 9409.27s]  Oh, my God.
[9410.63s -> 9411.19s]  Yeah, watch this.
[9411.19s -> 9411.75s]  Do watch this.
[9411.75s -> 9412.15s]  Watch this.

[9418.68s -> 9419.48s]  Oh, jeez.

[9424.09s -> 9425.37s]  It's it's it's amazing.
[9425.37s -> 9426.09s]  It really is.
[9426.09s -> 9432.41s]  I can't fucking believe that there was just a literal assassin kill transaction that just
[9432.41s -> 9434.65s]  played out on the stream.
[9434.65s -> 9439.85s]  That's going to it's going to be a real boon to my virtual assassin business.
[9439.85s -> 9440.81s]  I'm starting.

[9485.00s -> 9486.60s]  Well, let me turn off the light so I can't see shit.
[9497.54s -> 9498.66s]  Did they actually leave me alone?
[9498.66s -> 9499.94s]  These these nerds?
[9500.50s -> 9501.38s]  Maybe they didn't.
[9501.38s -> 9508.34s]  Maybe they don't know who you are.
[9508.34s -> 9512.79s]  Oh, oh, oh, my goodness.
[9513.51s -> 9514.55s]  Oh, that.

[9525.22s -> 9527.54s]  His future was indeed ratchet, wasn't it?
[9527.54s -> 9528.42s]  That's me.
[9528.42s -> 9528.90s]  That's me.
[9528.98s -> 9531.54s]  Like, I've been in that scenario like 30 times.
[9532.76s -> 9533.40s]  I feel for that guy.
[9533.40s -> 9535.59s]  I really do.
[9535.59s -> 9537.03s]  All right, let's get out of here.
[9537.03s -> 9537.75s]  I'm scared.
[9537.75s -> 9540.95s]  Just trying to adventure.
[9540.95s -> 9545.83s]  Just trying to get gear and shit.
[9545.83s -> 9548.98s]  I got a lot of loot this level.
[9548.98s -> 9549.46s]  You're dead.
[9550.33s -> 9552.65s]  Some say the loot is the friends are made along the way.
[9552.65s -> 9553.13s]  All right.
[9553.13s -> 9556.01s]  Oh, that dude is crying now.
[9557.77s -> 9559.37s]  You did get a lot of loot this level.
[9559.37s -> 9559.77s]  That's right.
[9560.41s -> 9561.69s]  Very profitable dungeon.
[9561.69s -> 9566.25s]  It was a good dungeon for you.
[9566.25s -> 9574.14s]  I got a rock.
[9574.14s -> 9575.10s]  Will you stop hitting me?
[9575.66s -> 9576.14s]  Thank you.
[9579.40s -> 9580.44s]  Oh, friends.
[9581.08s -> 9582.52s]  All right, here's the weak strat.
[9582.52s -> 9582.92s]  Watch that.
[9582.92s -> 9584.04s]  I have feign weakness, right?
[9586.22s -> 9587.58s]  Don't, please, please.
[9587.58s -> 9588.30s]  No, stop, please.
[9589.18s -> 9589.91s]  Oh, my God.
[9589.91s -> 9591.67s]  Please, no, please, God, no, please.
[9591.67s -> 9594.31s]  But you roared and that's a sign of aggression.
[9594.31s -> 9595.43s]  I don't know if I would.
[9595.43s -> 9596.07s]  I'd probably attack.
[9606.55s -> 9607.03s]  I'm still here.
[9607.03s -> 9610.52s]  I'm still here.
[9610.52s -> 9612.52s]  This is where you have to say like your controller unplugged.
[9619.38s -> 9620.66s]  Steps is what you're doing.
[9620.66s -> 9621.14s]  Steps is what you're doing.
[9621.14s -> 9621.54s]  I'm stuck.
[9621.54s -> 9622.02s]  I'm stuck.
[9622.02s -> 9623.94s]  I'm stuck in the gate.
[9623.94s -> 9624.42s]  Oh, my God.
[9624.42s -> 9624.82s]  Oh, my God.
[9624.82s -> 9625.70s]  These guys suck.
[9625.70s -> 9627.61s]  Have you seen that poke clip?
[9627.61s -> 9628.09s]  Yeah.
[9628.09s -> 9628.73s]  It was amazing.
[9628.73s -> 9630.41s]  So fucking unbelievably funny.
[9632.22s -> 9633.90s]  Oh, my controller is unplugged.
[9633.90s -> 9634.70s]  What the fuck?
[9641.42s -> 9642.54s]  He does it twice, too.
[9642.54s -> 9643.34s]  That's the best part.
[9643.34s -> 9644.22s]  It works two different times.
[9644.22s -> 9645.50s]  Do I get style points?
[9645.50s -> 9645.98s]  That's sweet.
[9645.98s -> 9646.78s]  Do you see that, dude?
[9646.78s -> 9647.82s]  Do you see that finesse?
[9647.82s -> 9648.70s]  That was actually pretty cool.
[9651.86s -> 9653.86s]  I'm kind of rooting for the zombie.
[9656.36s -> 9659.24s]  That's why nothing you've done today matters.
[9659.24s -> 9660.84s]  Well, I mean, you did kill somebody in cold.
[9660.84s -> 9661.40s]  Oh, Jesus.
[9664.89s -> 9665.37s]  I didn't mean it.
[9665.37s -> 9665.85s]  I didn't mean it.
[9665.85s -> 9666.25s]  I didn't mean it.
[9666.25s -> 9666.65s]  I'm sorry.
[9666.65s -> 9667.21s]  I'm sorry.
[9667.21s -> 9674.18s]  I'm sorry.
[9674.18s -> 9677.22s]  Oh, he shot me with a crossbow.
[9677.22s -> 9677.54s]  What?
[9677.54s -> 9678.26s]  He's a gamer.
[9678.90s -> 9679.94s]  Oh, my God.
[9679.94s -> 9681.38s]  Why didn't you just hit him on the head?
[9684.12s -> 9687.08s]  Because nobody paid me 50 subs for it.
[9687.08s -> 9687.48s]  That's why.
[9687.48s -> 9688.68s]  It's all Chad's fault.
[9688.68s -> 9689.16s]  That's why.
[9689.16s -> 9689.96s]  Oh, I'll tell you.
[9689.96s -> 9691.88s]  There's a whole battle going on after you died, too.
[9691.88s -> 9693.32s]  There was like a whole other group.
[9693.32s -> 9694.68s]  I mean, they're going to fight over that.
[9694.68s -> 9695.56s]  And it's all right.
[9696.36s -> 9697.80s]  You got a whole closet full of those things.
[9697.80s -> 9698.20s]  You're fine.
[9698.84s -> 9700.44s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9700.44s -> 9702.44s]  I have the the bardish now.
[9702.44s -> 9703.48s]  This this bad girl.
[9703.48s -> 9704.52s]  I've been holding on to her.
[9705.96s -> 9706.84s]  I feel OK.
[9706.84s -> 9708.12s]  You know what's funny?
[9708.12s -> 9709.72s]  You've got all this really cool stuff.
[9709.72s -> 9712.04s]  And I correct me if I'm wrong here.
[9712.04s -> 9715.72s]  I believe your angle here is, you know, you probably would normally would be like,
[9715.72s -> 9718.36s]  this actually sucks that I'm losing this this this great stuff.
[9718.36s -> 9719.96s]  But you're like, hey, it's over in three days.
[9721.08s -> 9721.96s]  Literally, that's where I'm at.
[9721.96s -> 9723.00s]  That's where I've been.
[9723.00s -> 9723.40s]  I got you.
[9723.40s -> 9723.88s]  I got you.
[9723.88s -> 9725.64s]  Since I got in this lobby, that's where I've been.
[9725.64s -> 9726.44s]  OK, I got you.
[9729.13s -> 9731.75s]  It's it's then I'll bring my blue.
[9732.31s -> 9732.63s]  Fine.
[9732.63s -> 9735.67s]  Oh, that's that's the blues are standing together.
[9735.91s -> 9736.79s]  This is what we need.
[9736.79s -> 9739.70s]  But OK, I'm bringing one blue.
[9740.50s -> 9743.53s]  But creepo, why don't you bring something about that?
[9743.53s -> 9745.21s]  I don't own anything.
[9745.21s -> 9745.61s]  All right.
[9745.61s -> 9749.82s]  Good thing I brought you a green stiletto broke ass bitch.
[9749.82s -> 9752.73s]  OK, I mean, I've got like 100 doubloons.
[9758.90s -> 9759.30s]  I don't know.
[9759.30s -> 9762.02s]  Should I buy something from those this lonely looking woodsman?
[9763.62s -> 9764.26s]  Probably not.
[9764.98s -> 9767.00s]  I love the artwork.
[9767.00s -> 9770.25s]  Same reminds me of Magic the Gathering.
[9770.25s -> 9772.25s]  Hmm.
[9772.25s -> 9774.33s]  OK, who is your favorite character?
[9774.33s -> 9778.25s]  Like who is who would you like to spend it like, you know,

[9810.66s -> 9811.86s]  I don't like any of them.
[9812.68s -> 9815.56s]  They all look mean and the tailor looks the meanest.
[9815.56s -> 9820.34s]  Like he's going to sell me some clothes with fucking razor blades in them.
[9820.34s -> 9825.38s]  Yeah, I maybe Valentine want to figure out, you know,
[9825.38s -> 9828.84s]  how he still has hope in such a hopeless world.
[9830.02s -> 9834.50s]  Can we talk about how the armor looks like the softest man and the hardest armor?
[9834.50s -> 9837.88s]  Like that man is not intimidating anybody.
[9837.88s -> 9843.05s]  And that is exactly why you should be afraid.
[9843.05s -> 9847.69s]  He's like a baby and like he's like an armored baby with a mustache.
[9848.84s -> 9852.70s]  Yeah, I'm picking the alchemist, the alchemist.
[9853.26s -> 9857.75s]  And then and then I'm going to like I'm going to like text the goblin

[9860.54s -> 9863.56s]  like doing some stuff just to kind of see like what he says.
[9863.56s -> 9867.77s]  And then I'd be able to bail like if it's like if it's a weird shit.
[9867.77s -> 9870.25s]  Yeah, you're going to catfish a goblin.
[9870.25s -> 9871.93s]  No, I'm just saying like, hey, what are you up to?

[9883.88s -> 9885.00s]  You wouldn't. OK.
[9885.00s -> 9888.12s]  For real, you wouldn't eat some flesh to make a friend for life.
[9888.12s -> 9893.06s]  I feel like at least two or three people here probably have eaten somebody
[9893.06s -> 9894.20s]  in your chat.
[9894.20s -> 9897.32s]  No, here at least I'm going.
[9897.32s -> 9900.36s]  But statistically, there's a lot of people here, like maybe three people
[9900.36s -> 9902.12s]  at least have probably eaten someone.
[9905.40s -> 9907.96s]  I mean, back then, I mean, it probably wasn't, you know, like in this.
[9907.96s -> 9908.28s]  All right.
[9908.28s -> 9912.12s]  We I'm bringing a good item and let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[9912.12s -> 9912.68s]  All right.
[9912.68s -> 9913.00s]  Yep.
[9913.00s -> 9915.56s]  It's weird how the ratio works because I feel like in my chat,
[9915.56s -> 9917.32s]  there's probably at least five people that have eaten someone.
[9917.32s -> 9918.04s]  There's less.
[9918.04s -> 9921.77s]  That's actually like how we get inducted in my chat is we eat people together.
[9921.77s -> 9923.69s]  Interesting.
[9923.69s -> 9924.41s]  Don't do that.
[9924.41s -> 9926.60s]  That's very interesting.
[9926.60s -> 9930.12s]  Sorry, I totally forgot to buy health pots because I know the minute
[9930.12s -> 9931.56s]  we get in there, Creepo is going to stab me.
[9931.56s -> 9935.80s]  So I mean, I'm accepting the fact that no, never mind.
[9935.80s -> 9940.44s]  I'm not accepting any assassination contracts right now.
[9940.44s -> 9941.96s]  No, and guess what?
[9941.96s -> 9942.76s]  And guess what?
[9942.76s -> 9946.28s]  If there is one on me, if you got an assassination contract, one of you
[9946.28s -> 9948.68s]  to just be aware, I'm fighting back.
[9948.68s -> 9949.40s]  I just want you to know.
[9950.04s -> 9953.32s]  I am not joining the Dark Brotherhood.
[9953.32s -> 9957.64s]  Yeah, honestly, I got to say you didn't do shit when he was just
[9957.64s -> 9959.48s]  literally stabbing you in your corneas.
[9960.36s -> 9962.04s]  You really just accepted it.
[9962.04s -> 9963.64s]  You look kind of dead stared at me.
[9963.64s -> 9965.56s]  We're like, this is, it's happening.
[9965.56s -> 9967.16s]  I wanted you to feel bad.
[9967.16s -> 9968.42s]  I wanted you to be like.
[9968.42s -> 9971.94s]  It's crazy how I don't at all.
[9971.94s -> 9976.70s]  Like I really got pushed there and I saw it in your face.
[9976.70s -> 9977.90s]  Didn't flinch.
[9980.20s -> 9981.08s]  Were you just shocked?
[9981.08s -> 9983.08s]  Like what was going through your mind at that time?
[9983.96s -> 9984.84s]  We're just playing the game.
[9985.32s -> 9986.84s]  And watch out for the spider behind you.
[9986.84s -> 9989.11s]  Oh, oh, oh, okay.
[9989.11s -> 9989.83s]  I'm body blocked.
[9989.83s -> 9990.07s]  Okay.
[9990.07s -> 9995.14s]  I can't move.
[9995.14s -> 9997.62s]  Can you there's I think I dropped a dagger for you.
[9998.18s -> 9999.53s]  Is there one here?
[9999.53s -> 10000.03s]  Yeah.
[10001.82s -> 10002.70s]  Honest to goodness.
[10002.70s -> 10003.74s]  Let's play.
[10003.74s -> 10015.82s]  Let's play, everyone.
[10015.82s -> 10015.98s]  All right.
[10015.98s -> 10016.54s]  We got to kill that.
[10016.54s -> 10017.82s]  We got to kill a spider spawner.
[10019.00s -> 10019.80s]  Oh, oh, beautiful.
[10019.80s -> 10020.44s]  I can see now.
[10020.44s -> 10021.00s]  I can see now.
[10021.00s -> 10021.72s]  This is huge.
[10021.72s -> 10029.13s]  The dewormer flushed out all of his feelings.
[10032.33s -> 10033.93s]  Yeah, they're in the diaper now.
[10033.93s -> 10035.69s]  Oh, beautiful hop, beautiful hop.
[10035.69s -> 10036.33s]  Exquisite.
[10036.33s -> 10036.73s]  Thank you.
[10037.37s -> 10039.29s]  The worms were what made me me.
[10041.50s -> 10043.66s]  Oh, that was the good old one, two combo.
[10044.52s -> 10045.86s]  Look at that.
[10045.86s -> 10047.22s]  The one to buckle my shoe.
[10047.22s -> 10048.26s]  I love the long sword, by the way.
[10048.26s -> 10049.06s]  It's my favorite weapon.
[10049.06s -> 10049.86s]  I jumped.
[10049.86s -> 10052.18s]  I jumped over the corner of this and it's still activated.
[10052.18s -> 10053.86s]  I'm refunding this game.
[10053.86s -> 10054.50s]  That's actually.
[10054.50s -> 10057.14s]  Oh, you jumped on that like a trampoline.
[10057.14s -> 10057.70s]  I know.
[10057.70s -> 10058.74s]  I just wanted to.
[10058.74s -> 10060.10s]  I could have walked a long way.
[10060.10s -> 10061.38s]  Here's an army sword for you, by the way.
[10061.38s -> 10062.50s]  If you want a one hand.
[10064.74s -> 10066.31s]  All right.
[10066.31s -> 10069.83s]  There are friends directly to our south.
[10069.83s -> 10071.29s]  There's a wizard in the room.
[10071.29s -> 10073.00s]  A wizard.
[10073.00s -> 10074.12s]  Oh, oh, God.
[10074.60s -> 10076.26s]  OK, hold on.
[10076.26s -> 10077.61s]  We can go this way.
[10077.61s -> 10078.57s]  Yeah, I can stun.
[10078.57s -> 10079.21s]  I can stun them.
[10081.05s -> 10089.69s]  I'll pay you 15 V bucks if you kill stir.
[10090.41s -> 10092.57s]  Now, I'm not taking any contracts right now.
[10093.53s -> 10094.01s]  Or ever.
[10099.18s -> 10101.42s]  Boys, if you take health, we can go back to that healing shrine
[10101.42s -> 10107.48s]  at the beginning of the level.
[10107.48s -> 10108.28s]  I said nice.
[10108.28s -> 10108.52s]  Nice.
[10108.52s -> 10109.56s]  Oh, that.
[10109.56s -> 10111.64s]  OK, I didn't know that was the second part of the swing.
[10111.64s -> 10115.24s]  You kind of really styled with it here.
[10115.24s -> 10115.72s]  I got you.
[10115.72s -> 10116.92s]  I got you a beautiful little helmet.
[10116.92s -> 10118.10s]  Check this out.
[10118.10s -> 10121.94s]  Protect that noggin from facial stabs.
[10122.02s -> 10124.18s]  All right, pretty good.
[10124.18s -> 10124.58s]  Thank you.
[10125.22s -> 10127.50s]  I'm going down the secret tunnel.
[10127.50s -> 10129.80s]  Secret tunnel.
[10129.80s -> 10138.41s]  There were friends down here.
[10138.41s -> 10142.18s]  Oh, it's all blocked up right here.
[10142.18s -> 10150.36s]  Oh, I can't even hit it because this guy's just standing on the spikes.
[10150.36s -> 10153.88s]  That's so sweet of him to take that damage for us.
[10153.88s -> 10154.76s]  Oh, he killed a player.
[10154.76s -> 10155.96s]  That's so sad.
[10155.96s -> 10159.96s]  Oh, oh, this guy is armored.
[10159.96s -> 10161.64s]  That's not watch out for the orb.
[10164.66s -> 10165.62s]  This is really fun.
[10165.62s -> 10169.13s]  I actually really like this weapon of the long sword.
[10169.13s -> 10171.77s]  Yeah, you can you can block with it and you can get a parry off.
[10171.77s -> 10174.57s]  Sir, do you want to get this hat that I just put on the ground?
[10174.57s -> 10180.87s]  It's a guy in.
[10180.87s -> 10182.38s]  OK, thank you.
[10184.95s -> 10186.95s]  There's a chest that we didn't loot over here.
[10187.67s -> 10191.11s]  If you guys I was in the middle of it, but then he offered.
[10191.11s -> 10191.59s]  I got it.
[10192.39s -> 10193.75s]  It's my I hate.
[10193.75s -> 10195.11s]  I'm going to still do it fast.
[10197.11s -> 10198.15s]  I'm keeping it closed.
[10198.15s -> 10199.27s]  I'm keeping it closed.
[10199.27s -> 10201.51s]  I'm RP opening it with one finger.
[10201.51s -> 10202.23s]  Oh, my goodness.
[10202.23s -> 10204.79s]  You got launched.
[10204.79s -> 10208.33s]  You made a trebuchet out of a that was awful.
[10208.33s -> 10208.97s]  And what are these?
[10208.97s -> 10212.65s]  What are these sacrifices to resurrect player?
[10212.65s -> 10213.54s]  Yeah.
[10213.54s -> 10214.58s]  Oh, OK.
[10216.70s -> 10217.66s]  There's another big chest.
[10217.66s -> 10220.22s]  I'm going to, you know, I'm just going to go over here real quick.
[10220.22s -> 10222.06s]  Oh, I don't have the lock.
[10222.06s -> 10223.02s]  You take these.
[10223.02s -> 10225.74s]  Oh, you're right.
[10227.18s -> 10228.57s]  Big enemy.
[10228.57s -> 10229.13s]  Oh, yeah.
[10229.13s -> 10230.46s]  Come to us.
[10230.46s -> 10231.99s]  I can't get them.
[10231.99s -> 10232.31s]  Yeah.
[10232.31s -> 10232.79s]  Fuck you.
[10234.07s -> 10235.78s]  All right.
[10235.78s -> 10236.34s]  Close the door.
[10245.93s -> 10246.65s]  Good one, guys.
[10247.21s -> 10248.89s]  You really had me going.
[10248.89s -> 10249.45s]  Oh, my God.
[10249.45s -> 10250.33s]  I can't swing in here.
[10250.33s -> 10251.45s]  I have to crouch and swing.
[10251.45s -> 10252.01s]  That's so sad.
[10261.56s -> 10262.36s]  Wait, I think there's.
[10263.00s -> 10263.56s]  Oh, yeah.
[10263.56s -> 10264.44s]  Cool, cool, cool, cool.
[10264.44s -> 10265.24s]  Uh, help.
[10265.24s -> 10265.56s]  All right.
[10265.56s -> 10268.04s]  We have to kill these Rangers first, otherwise we're going to get screwed over.
[10275.66s -> 10276.46s]  Ranger top left.
[10277.58s -> 10277.98s]  Oh, my.
[10277.98s -> 10279.34s]  You guys are still on the mummy.
[10280.46s -> 10282.22s]  That was just like you.
[10282.22s -> 10284.62s]  That was just so funny looking over here.
[10284.62s -> 10285.50s]  Talking strategy.
[10285.50s -> 10287.50s]  You guys are over there playing patty cake with the zombie.
[10287.50s -> 10292.22s]  And I wouldn't trade it for the world.
[10293.18s -> 10294.14s]  You boys are the world to me.
[10295.02s -> 10295.50s]  Thank you.
[10296.30s -> 10297.58s]  What the gas?
[10297.58s -> 10298.06s]  Come on.
[10298.86s -> 10301.69s]  Do I have any help for healing?
[10301.69s -> 10302.66s]  No.
[10302.66s -> 10303.94s]  There's a healing shrine right behind you.
[10305.51s -> 10306.15s]  Oh, there it is.
[10306.15s -> 10307.11s]  Where we came from.
[10307.11s -> 10308.39s]  I thought somebody used it.
[10309.83s -> 10310.95s]  I was tempted.
[10310.95s -> 10312.31s]  You should probably use it.
[10312.31s -> 10313.83s]  Can you whirlwind or something?
[10313.83s -> 10315.83s]  I have a whirlwind.
[10315.83s -> 10318.07s]  What is this?
[10318.07s -> 10319.83s]  Everybody, just calm down.
[10319.83s -> 10320.71s]  Just calm down.
[10320.71s -> 10321.27s]  I'm thinking.
[10322.55s -> 10322.87s]  Boom.
[10322.87s -> 10323.43s]  There we go.
[10323.43s -> 10323.75s]  Kill him.
[10327.51s -> 10328.07s]  Oh, shit.
[10328.87s -> 10331.58s]  I don't like daggers.
[10331.58s -> 10334.28s]  Not a dagger guy.
[10336.86s -> 10337.82s]  They're so short range.
[10338.78s -> 10339.10s]  Yeah.
[10340.68s -> 10342.76s]  Some say it's not the size of the sword.
[10342.76s -> 10344.44s]  It's the motion of the blade.
[10344.44s -> 10346.66s]  There's a lot of enemies right now.
[10346.66s -> 10347.08s]  Yeah.
[10347.08s -> 10348.36s]  You guys are getting tons of XP, you know.
[10353.18s -> 10355.54s]  There's a purple V hander.
[10355.54s -> 10356.10s]  No, there's not.
[10356.10s -> 10357.62s]  Oh, there is.
[10357.62s -> 10359.06s]  No, there's not.
[10359.06s -> 10359.54s]  Where is it?
[10359.54s -> 10360.34s]  On the floor right here.
[10360.90s -> 10362.02s]  Redemption arc.
[10362.02s -> 10362.50s]  No way.
[10365.70s -> 10366.98s]  Up on the chest up here.
[10366.98s -> 10368.74s]  Oh, now you can see it, right?
[10368.74s -> 10369.54s]  Holy shit.
[10369.54s -> 10371.06s]  Can you see it when I turn that off?
[10371.06s -> 10372.26s]  Oh, my goodness.
[10374.98s -> 10376.34s]  We got any campfires in here?
[10376.90s -> 10377.70s]  I have one on me.
[10377.70s -> 10378.18s]  Yep.
[10378.18s -> 10378.98s]  Here, if you want to take it
[10378.98s -> 10381.46s]  because it'll actually take me four years to set it up.
[10381.46s -> 10382.98s]  It'll be 2024.
[10382.98s -> 10383.30s]  Holy shit.
[10383.30s -> 10384.74s]  The beta test will be over.
[10384.74s -> 10386.55s]  This thing is insane.
[10386.55s -> 10391.88s]  I thought I heard movement.
[10391.88s -> 10392.44s]  Yes, I did.
[10392.44s -> 10393.24s]  Oh, we're fucked.
[10393.24s -> 10395.88s]  We know we got to get out of here.
[10395.88s -> 10397.48s]  You picked the wrong time.
[10398.36s -> 10399.00s]  Oh, don't you?
[10399.00s -> 10399.56s]  No, come on.
[10399.56s -> 10400.04s]  Come on.
[10400.04s -> 10410.22s]  Oh, sorry.
[10410.22s -> 10410.94s]  Behind you.
[10410.94s -> 10411.42s]  German knife.
[10411.42s -> 10412.06s]  Oh, my God.
[10413.10s -> 10413.82s]  The darkness.
[10413.82s -> 10414.86s]  I killed him.
[10414.94s -> 10416.84s]  I killed him.
[10416.84s -> 10418.20s]  Oh, God, dude.
[10418.20s -> 10419.56s]  I was just trying to be the light.
[10419.56s -> 10420.28s]  I'm going to die.
[10421.54s -> 10422.74s]  No, no, no, you're not.
[10422.74s -> 10423.30s]  No, you're not.
[10423.30s -> 10423.78s]  Stay with me.
[10423.78s -> 10426.23s]  Stay with me.
[10426.23s -> 10427.91s]  Dedicated light boy.
[10427.91s -> 10430.15s]  Honestly, if I had taken that torch down,
[10430.15s -> 10431.67s]  we may have actually lost that.
[10431.67s -> 10432.47s]  Oh, here you go.
[10432.47s -> 10433.11s]  Here you go.
[10433.11s -> 10433.59s]  Take this.
[10433.59s -> 10436.73s]  Well, it's only one person here has night vision.
[10436.73s -> 10437.61s]  It's not me.
[10437.61s -> 10443.98s]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[10443.98s -> 10445.10s]  Look, I just look.
[10445.10s -> 10446.70s]  I just fucked your friends over.
[10446.70s -> 10447.66s]  Do not come down here.
[10447.66s -> 10450.71s]  I swear to God on everything, brother, brother.
[10450.71s -> 10451.03s]  All right.
[10451.59s -> 10453.19s]  You do not want this smoke, dude.
[10453.19s -> 10454.07s]  I'm not coming down there.
[10454.07s -> 10455.59s]  Just don't leave me alone.
[10455.59s -> 10456.31s]  Leave us alone.
[10456.31s -> 10457.40s]  Look at that strap.
[10457.40s -> 10460.76s]  All right.
[10464.47s -> 10465.75s]  You have a wonderful evening.
[10465.75s -> 10467.27s]  No, the campfire went out.
[10467.27s -> 10468.87s]  The campfire just went out.
[10468.87s -> 10469.75s]  What the fuck?
[10470.47s -> 10471.35s]  I'm running away.
[10471.35s -> 10476.60s]  Dude, he was like, I'm literally right in front of you.
[10476.60s -> 10480.04s]  I was trying to do like, I was trying to do like, oh, yeah.
[10480.04s -> 10482.36s]  Like, oh, man, I'm so scared of you, man.
[10482.36s -> 10483.80s]  And like, oh, shit, that guy must be.
[10483.80s -> 10487.24s]  He must have beat that guy's friends.
[10487.24s -> 10487.88s]  God damn it.
[10487.88s -> 10489.32s]  I was I was so concerned.
[10489.32s -> 10489.80s]  All right.
[10489.80s -> 10490.12s]  Fuck.
[10490.12s -> 10491.00s]  This is a cool item.
[10494.63s -> 10495.43s]  He's going to come around.
[10495.43s -> 10496.47s]  I was.
[10496.47s -> 10497.27s]  Oh, my.
[10497.27s -> 10498.87s]  Oh, my mother of pearl.
[10498.87s -> 10499.35s]  Come on.
[10502.54s -> 10503.74s]  Healing healing shrine.
[10503.74s -> 10506.28s]  Oh, that's nice.
[10507.50s -> 10508.30s]  Yeah, you should take that.
[10509.18s -> 10513.18s]  Yeah.
[10513.18s -> 10517.90s]  The strategy was I wanted them to think you were talking to my group
[10517.90s -> 10520.06s]  and that you were very strong and to not come down here.
[10520.06s -> 10520.78s]  We got it.
[10520.78s -> 10521.18s]  We got it.
[10521.18s -> 10522.38s]  Yeah, it was clever.
[10524.14s -> 10525.58s]  My knowledge is six.
[10525.58s -> 10527.34s]  In RP, I didn't understand that.
[10527.34s -> 10530.49s]  But somebody asked in chat.
[10530.49s -> 10531.21s]  Out of character.
[10531.21s -> 10532.01s]  I definitely.
[10532.01s -> 10535.11s]  Oh, well, OK.
[10535.11s -> 10536.63s]  Somebody said, what the fuck happened, bro?
[10536.63s -> 10537.51s]  And I was explaining it.
[10542.95s -> 10543.51s]  All right.
[10543.51s -> 10545.19s]  I think there's two portals here.
[10545.19s -> 10545.43s]  Nice.
[10545.43s -> 10545.91s]  See you later.
[10547.27s -> 10548.39s]  Doosies.
[10548.39s -> 10548.95s]  Oh, my God.
[10548.95s -> 10550.07s]  This is actually crazy.
[10553.85s -> 10554.17s]  Come on.
[10555.51s -> 10555.99s]  You guys.
[10555.99s -> 10556.87s]  You guys are leaving.
[10557.74s -> 10557.90s]  Yeah.
[10557.90s -> 10558.06s]  Yeah.
[10558.06s -> 10560.22s]  100% You guys are leaving, huh?
[10560.22s -> 10563.02s]  I I got a purple is way under, man.
[10563.02s -> 10564.70s]  This way under arc is just beginning.
[10564.70s -> 10565.18s]  I'm sorry.
[10565.18s -> 10565.66s]  I had to leave.
[10566.38s -> 10567.42s]  No, I understand.
[10569.08s -> 10571.40s]  You're a what was that movie?
[10571.40s -> 10573.51s]  Uh, oh, my God.
[10573.51s -> 10575.27s]  I cannot believe I'm blanking on this movie.
[10575.27s -> 10575.99s]  There can only be one.
[10575.99s -> 10576.95s]  What's that movie?
[10576.95s -> 10578.23s]  I know you know what I'm talking about.
[10578.23s -> 10579.77s]  It can only be one.
[10580.49s -> 10582.49s]  Yeah.
[10582.49s -> 10582.73s]  What?
[10583.61s -> 10584.63s]  Highlander.
[10585.19s -> 10586.15s]  Yes, the Highlander.
[10586.15s -> 10590.81s]  You're a cardigan now for a Kerrigan.
[10590.81s -> 10592.81s]  I'm literally right in front of you, dude.
[10599.00s -> 10599.96s]  How close was he to me?
[10600.44s -> 10605.46s]  Honestly, I feel like he was literally right in front of my like model.
[10605.46s -> 10606.10s]  That was nuts.
[10607.38s -> 10608.66s]  I don't really know where to go.
[10609.22s -> 10609.46s]  All right.
[10609.46s -> 10609.94s]  Here's the plan.
[10609.94s -> 10610.26s]  Here's the plan.
[10610.26s -> 10612.26s]  What you're going to do is just take the red portal.
[10612.26s -> 10613.53s]  No, I'm just kidding.
[10613.53s -> 10617.54s]  Um, I just don't want to waste you guys' time.
[10618.10s -> 10621.50s]  No, you don't want to take the red.
[10621.50s -> 10624.86s]  I just clicked what kind of just happened in the last five minutes.
[10624.86s -> 10628.39s]  And I just I just realized what happened.
[10628.39s -> 10629.35s]  Uh, do not do.
[10629.35s -> 10630.07s]  What are you doing?
[10630.07s -> 10630.63s]  What?
[10630.63s -> 10632.10s]  Why do you do this?
[10632.10s -> 10632.26s]  What?
[10632.26s -> 10633.54s]  What are you doing?
[10633.54s -> 10634.18s]  What's going on?
[10634.18s -> 10635.06s]  What's he doing?
[10635.06s -> 10637.30s]  He's causing himself damage to cause me stress.
[10643.54s -> 10644.50s]  There's nowhere to go.
[10645.14s -> 10646.34s]  Nothing will rival.
[10646.34s -> 10649.61s]  You literally avoided the circle just to.
[10649.61s -> 10650.41s]  That was amazing.
[10651.45s -> 10654.33s]  I was just taking a fucking walk around the park.
[10654.33s -> 10654.97s]  Yes.
[10654.97s -> 10655.29s]  Yes.
[10656.41s -> 10659.02s]  All right.
[10659.02s -> 10660.14s]  I got another stiletto for you.
[10660.14s -> 10660.54s]  Luckily.
[10662.76s -> 10663.72s]  He's my last one.
[10664.76s -> 10666.89s]  I know I'm going to buy you one at this point though.
[10668.09s -> 10669.21s]  I could buy one.
[10669.21s -> 10669.85s]  I have a short story.
[10670.41s -> 10671.53s]  It's not selling any.
[10671.53s -> 10672.81s]  Sir, I have a blue short sword.
[10675.03s -> 10678.95s]  I mean, I got a really good short sword from someone in that game and then I died.
[10678.95s -> 10680.52s]  Well, I have one for you.
[10680.52s -> 10681.56s]  And it was your fault.
[10682.12s -> 10684.04s]  OK, I'm ready.
[10684.04s -> 10686.46s]  What if we all just clicked ready and just went again?
[10687.18s -> 10688.54s]  I still have gear.
[10688.54s -> 10690.78s]  I'm sorry, stuff to sell.
[10690.78s -> 10690.94s]  Yeah.
[10690.94s -> 10696.47s]  OK, well, then I'm going to have to go on some like psycho tangent if we don't go right now.
[10696.47s -> 10697.03s]  Oh, God.
[10697.03s -> 10697.91s]  Oh, he's doing it.
[10699.11s -> 10699.99s]  It's the dewormer.
[10700.47s -> 10701.03s]  Oh, my God.
[10701.03s -> 10701.35s]  OK.
[10701.35s -> 10702.07s]  Just stir.
[10702.07s -> 10704.14s]  Just wait a second, please.
[10704.14s -> 10705.26s]  I'm just I'm just putting it in.
[10705.26s -> 10706.87s]  I'm just I'm just.
[10706.87s -> 10707.27s]  Oh, sir.
[10707.27s -> 10708.39s]  How do you feel about people subs?
[10708.39s -> 10708.71s]  They go.
[10710.39s -> 10710.87s]  Distract.
[10710.87s -> 10714.39s]  That's a meatball firehouse subs.
[10714.39s -> 10714.95s]  They make subs.
[10714.95s -> 10715.91s]  They make a meatball sub.
[10715.91s -> 10717.27s]  Sometimes they get their meatball sub.
[10717.27s -> 10717.83s]  It's OK.
[10718.87s -> 10719.59s]  It's pretty good.
[10719.59s -> 10721.51s]  I think it's pretty safe everywhere.
[10721.51s -> 10723.11s]  Most meatballs are too big, though.
[10725.51s -> 10726.55s]  Yeah, I can understand.
[10726.55s -> 10731.83s]  And there's always the one like cartoon spaghetti plate with one giant meatball on it.
[10732.78s -> 10735.34s]  And you know, in the center of that meatball is like an ice cube.
[10735.34s -> 10737.91s]  That's actually kind of true.
[10739.54s -> 10740.34s]  Interesting.
[10740.34s -> 10742.89s]  Yeah, no, I know what you mean.
[10742.89s -> 10747.45s]  I like, you know, Subway, the subway meatball sub.
[10747.45s -> 10751.21s]  I haven't had it in a while, but they have like the perfect size meatballs.
[10751.21s -> 10753.53s]  They're pretty good.
[10753.53s -> 10755.05s]  My worms are really like that one.
[10755.05s -> 10759.90s]  Have you named your worms?
[10761.16s -> 10762.28s]  There's way too many.
[10762.28s -> 10764.15s]  That's huge.
[10764.15s -> 10765.03s]  I'm proud of you.
[10765.03s -> 10766.39s]  It sounds like a healthy colony.
[10766.39s -> 10769.83s]  Sir, I got a short sword.
[10769.83s -> 10776.33s]  I mean, if you're looking to lose weight, got a couple of tips for you.
[10777.21s -> 10781.98s]  You're actually talking to somebody that's very like in the nutrition and fucking fitness world.
[10781.98s -> 10785.94s]  Both of you could probably talk to each other and, you know, level.
[10785.94s -> 10788.42s]  Oh, well, my suggestion was to get worms.
[10788.42s -> 10790.98s]  Yeah, well, I prefer just a worm like a tapeworm.
[10790.98s -> 10794.74s]  You know, that way it's like easier to just get that one out.
[10794.74s -> 10797.80s]  But hey, I feel like I don't know.
[10797.80s -> 10801.40s]  It wasn't a trend for a while to get tapeworms to help people lose weight.
[10801.40s -> 10803.96s]  I hope that sounds like something that could have happened.
[10803.96s -> 10807.32s]  My big business plan, if I ever really make it and, you know, have some money to invest.
[10807.32s -> 10808.76s]  No, don't let him cook here.
[10809.24s -> 10812.12s]  He's going to be having LSD drug chairs at a movie theater.
[10812.12s -> 10813.85s]  Don't let him cook.
[10813.85s -> 10817.13s]  I was going to start talking about putting people in comas for weight loss.
[10817.13s -> 10817.61s]  All right.
[10817.61s -> 10821.69s]  If you're ever just really bored and you're like waiting for the new like a new game to come out
[10821.69s -> 10824.86s]  and you want to lose some weight, just put you in a coma for like a month.
[10824.86s -> 10826.62s]  Eric Cartman did that in South Park.
[10827.34s -> 10827.82s]  Oh, did he?
[10829.50s -> 10832.82s]  Could you imagine, though, like the amount of.
[10832.82s -> 10834.34s]  There's a lot of shit in this room.
[10835.22s -> 10836.74s]  I'm just thinking, well, yeah, hold on.
[10836.74s -> 10837.78s]  Let me stun him, let me stun him.
[10838.50s -> 10839.16s]  There we go.
[10839.16s -> 10839.64s]  Just kill him.
[10841.29s -> 10843.93s]  I was just thinking, like, what would they do with all like this?
[10843.93s -> 10846.17s]  Because because people in coma, don't they still defecate?
[10847.29s -> 10848.25s]  Like, I don't know.
[10850.17s -> 10853.29s]  I've never looked at the logistics of being in a coma.
[10853.29s -> 10855.85s]  You're going to need like a nurse to take care of you.
[10856.49s -> 10859.29s]  Like, can you imagine how many new jobs be created just from having like
[10859.29s -> 10861.53s]  handle the the waste of people in a coma from that?
[10861.53s -> 10863.05s]  That might be a brilliant job.
[10863.05s -> 10866.52s]  Like, hey, I'm a weight loss shit technician.
[10866.52s -> 10868.36s]  Basically, I didn't let either one of them cook.
[10868.36s -> 10869.64s]  I'm not even in the kitchen right now.
[10869.64s -> 10873.21s]  I'm just saying that like Eric Cartman did this for a game console, didn't he?
[10873.21s -> 10873.69s]  You know what?
[10873.69s -> 10876.25s]  You want to know something about you, German, that maybe you haven't noticed
[10876.25s -> 10882.09s]  is every time I played with you in a group, you shut down everyone else's conversations.
[10882.09s -> 10885.37s]  Yeah, we're trying to talk about like shit in a coma.
[10885.37s -> 10885.61s]  Yeah.
[10885.61s -> 10886.81s]  And you're like, oh, I don't know.
[10888.73s -> 10889.69s]  Oh, scary.
[10889.69s -> 10891.29s]  You look out for that stir.
[10891.29s -> 10892.25s]  Look out.
[10892.25s -> 10894.28s]  That's my first one.
[10894.28s -> 10895.08s]  Oh, that's true.
[10895.88s -> 10897.40s]  It kind of did catch me off guard.
[10897.40s -> 10908.97s]  Man, so are you saying there's no like plausibility, like it's not plausible
[10908.97s -> 10913.13s]  that you could have a shitting like like profession, a shit handler?
[10913.13s -> 10914.17s]  Is that what you're saying?
[10914.17s -> 10916.71s]  I mean, are the realm of possibilities?
[10916.71s -> 10917.83s]  I feel like it could happen.
[10917.83s -> 10918.55s]  Anything is possible.
[10918.55s -> 10919.03s]  Check this out.
[10919.03s -> 10919.91s]  Check this out, boys.
[10919.91s -> 10921.27s]  I got a secret tunnel for you.
[10921.27s -> 10923.19s]  Come to come to Papa's secret tunnel.
[10923.19s -> 10926.87s]  Stand on the square.
[10926.87s -> 10927.99s]  Secret tunnel.
[10927.99s -> 10928.55s]  I'm not doing that.
[10928.55s -> 10930.23s]  It's going to be like a trap door.
[10930.23s -> 10932.55s]  Yeah, I've gone to Papa's secret tunnel before.
[10932.55s -> 10932.95s]  Come on.
[10933.59s -> 10934.47s]  Come on, dude.
[10934.47s -> 10935.51s]  Don't be weird.
[10935.51s -> 10939.02s]  Oh, there is actually stuff down here.
[10939.02s -> 10940.70s]  Jesus, we've made it this far together.
[10940.70s -> 10942.62s]  Is it worth it to do the pickaxe stuff?
[10943.42s -> 10949.74s]  I tried it and then I got annoyed when it took so long and I died to a interaction speed.
[10949.74s -> 10952.33s]  Change that in theory.
[10952.33s -> 10953.22s]  Yeah.
[10953.22s -> 10953.70s]  Oh, my God.
[10953.70s -> 10954.10s]  I can see.
[10954.90s -> 10964.31s]  Oh, my God.
[10964.31s -> 10965.03s]  You're doing great.
[10965.03s -> 10966.15s]  You're waxing with the longsword.
[10966.15s -> 10966.95s]  Look at this guy.
[10966.95s -> 10967.43s]  Oh, my God.
[10967.43s -> 10968.63s]  Look at the finesse.
[10969.43s -> 10970.23s]  I love this thing.
[10970.23s -> 10971.35s]  This thing's actually really fun.
[10971.99s -> 10972.55s]  Isn't it?
[10972.55s -> 10972.79s]  Yeah.
[10974.15s -> 10975.59s]  Oh, look at that.
[10975.59s -> 10976.39s]  That was fun.
[10980.68s -> 10981.08s]  Diamond.
[10983.82s -> 10987.34s]  I'm going to let the record show that the next time the lights go off
[10987.34s -> 10989.66s]  and I'm fighting somebody, I'm just not even going to swing anymore.
[10991.32s -> 10992.92s]  Actually, I got two diamonds.
[10992.92s -> 10993.40s]  Holy shit.
[10996.55s -> 10998.07s]  Don't people do that at nursing homes?
[10998.07s -> 10999.11s]  In theory, yes.
[10999.11s -> 11002.95s]  But I'm saying like specifically like because you put more people in comas to lose weight,
[11002.95s -> 11003.11s]  right?
[11003.11s -> 11005.19s]  A lot of people need to lose weight or want to lose weight.
[11005.19s -> 11008.87s]  You're going to have a large amount of shit on your hands.
[11008.87s -> 11009.59s]  Literally.
[11009.59s -> 11013.62s]  Well, I'm typing there's just one guy who's the shit guy.
[11014.50s -> 11016.98s]  Yeah, I'm typing in the group chat, guys.
[11016.98s -> 11017.70s]  Why not me?
[11019.91s -> 11021.67s]  Oh, here we go.
[11021.67s -> 11022.79s]  Oh, goodness.
[11022.79s -> 11024.31s]  I forgot to wait.
[11024.31s -> 11025.03s]  Here we go.
[11025.03s -> 11025.67s]  There we go.
[11025.67s -> 11027.27s]  I forgot to put a question mark at the end of that.
[11027.83s -> 11029.54s]  But here we go.
[11030.18s -> 11034.41s]  Look, I'm sorry for everything.
[11034.41s -> 11035.05s]  No, no, no.
[11035.05s -> 11036.33s]  Kraken was asking of how many we had.
[11038.89s -> 11039.69s]  Dude, I'm sorry.
[11042.41s -> 11043.13s]  Be better.
[11043.13s -> 11043.77s]  Then be better.
[11043.77s -> 11044.57s]  Then prove it to me.
[11044.57s -> 11045.37s]  Be better.
[11045.37s -> 11046.89s]  He's trying to replace me right now.
[11046.89s -> 11047.69s]  Be better then.
[11047.69s -> 11049.05s]  OK, I'm sorry.
[11049.05s -> 11050.73s]  I didn't bring up the poop thing he did.
[11053.66s -> 11054.22s]  All right.
[11054.22s -> 11055.18s]  You got a jump crowd.
[11055.18s -> 11055.98s]  OK, OK.
[11056.70s -> 11058.47s]  To be fair.
[11059.11s -> 11062.02s]  Yeah, I totally brought it up.
[11062.02s -> 11063.78s]  Now, Sterk can't get kicked from the guild.
[11063.78s -> 11066.50s]  He's the leader of the guild as much as we want him out of here.
[11066.50s -> 11068.02s]  He's the one that put the kick power.
[11070.30s -> 11074.46s]  You can't escape.
[11074.46s -> 11075.90s]  Oh, oh, oh, this is the big room.
[11075.90s -> 11076.30s]  Let's go.
[11076.94s -> 11078.54s]  Oh, we're about to make some money today.
[11080.71s -> 11082.39s]  Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.
[11084.22s -> 11085.26s]  That move is so good.
[11088.14s -> 11089.98s]  The fear is long sword.
[11089.98s -> 11091.10s]  Whatever that like stun, whatever it is.
[11091.10s -> 11091.90s]  Does that work on players?
[11091.90s -> 11092.14s]  Oh, yeah.
[11092.78s -> 11093.58s]  No, I wish.
[11093.58s -> 11094.06s]  Oh, my God.
[11094.06s -> 11097.90s]  Can you imagine the carnage that would rain down upon these servers?
[11097.90s -> 11099.58s]  Do you know what would happen to these people?
[11099.58s -> 11101.10s]  It would be a stun and then a kill.
[11102.22s -> 11103.10s]  They wouldn't play anymore.
[11103.10s -> 11104.38s]  I got three diamonds.
[11104.38s -> 11106.14s]  Gamers, gamers, gamers, gamers.
[11106.14s -> 11106.94s]  No gamers.
[11106.94s -> 11107.58s]  Oh, Jesus.
[11108.22s -> 11113.91s]  Let's talk this through, boys.
[11113.91s -> 11114.63s]  Let's talk this through.
[11114.63s -> 11115.43s]  Let's talk this through.
[11115.43s -> 11115.91s]  Come on.
[11115.91s -> 11116.55s]  Come on.
[11116.55s -> 11117.43s]  I don't know if they're talking.
[11118.81s -> 11120.25s]  Have you seen the leaderboards?
[11120.25s -> 11121.29s]  I'm not up there, but I will be.
[11121.29s -> 11121.85s]  I'm not up there, but I will be.
[11124.26s -> 11125.30s]  Shut up, Frank.
[11125.30s -> 11126.74s]  Like, play the game already.
[11126.74s -> 11127.94s]  Shut up, Frank.
[11127.94s -> 11128.90s]  Oh, my God, Clyde.
[11128.90s -> 11129.78s]  I'm doing my best.
[11130.42s -> 11133.54s]  It's just don't game with your little brothers.
[11133.54s -> 11135.62s]  Stop talking over me when I'm trying to communicate.
[11141.13s -> 11142.09s]  You killed my friend.
[11151.98s -> 11152.38s]  Okay.
[11164.14s -> 11165.26s]  Where are you going, Clumb Guzzler?
[11165.98s -> 11166.46s]  Calm down.
[11166.46s -> 11167.02s]  Calm down.
[11167.02s -> 11168.54s]  I got to get a fucking potion on.
[11169.18s -> 11173.50s]  Just like that toxic fucking shitty raid leader or something.
[11174.14s -> 11175.26s]  That's so stupid.
[11175.26s -> 11177.02s]  Where's the DPS at?
[11177.02s -> 11177.66s]  Live by the bit.
[11177.66s -> 11179.58s]  The guy hasn't hit a dagger shot.
[11179.58s -> 11179.98s]  Hit him.
[11179.98s -> 11180.78s]  Hit him once.
[11180.78s -> 11181.18s]  Once.
[11181.18s -> 11181.66s]  I dare you.
[11181.66s -> 11182.38s]  I dare you.
[11185.50s -> 11185.98s]  All right.
[11185.98s -> 11186.70s]  Oh, shit.
[11186.70s -> 11187.26s]  Oh, shit.
[11188.78s -> 11189.18s]  Oh, my God.
[11189.18s -> 11189.66s]  Oh, my God.
[11190.62s -> 11192.86s]  Oh, did they both kill each other?
[11192.86s -> 11193.58s]  Oh, my God.
[11194.38s -> 11195.26s]  Did we?
[11195.26s -> 11195.98s]  I think you did.
[11196.86s -> 11197.90s]  No, I just killed him.
[11197.90s -> 11199.42s]  Look at the kill feed, boys.
[11199.42s -> 11200.22s]  Look at the kill feed.
[11200.30s -> 11200.86s]  I'll let you have it.
[11201.90s -> 11202.54s]  I got him.
[11202.54s -> 11202.78s]  Wow.
[11202.78s -> 11204.06s]  The kill feed said I got him.
[11204.06s -> 11204.46s]  Yeah, no.
[11205.18s -> 11206.50s]  Wait, no, it doesn't.
[11206.50s -> 11206.90s]  No, it doesn't.
[11206.90s -> 11207.54s]  No, it said I got him.
[11207.54s -> 11208.50s]  Yeah, no, it says I got him.
[11208.50s -> 11209.22s]  Yeah, I see.
[11209.22s -> 11209.62s]  Yeah, I see.
[11209.62s -> 11210.02s]  I see it.
[11210.02s -> 11210.50s]  You're...
[11210.50s -> 11211.30s]  Yep.
[11211.30s -> 11212.98s]  For the guild.
[11212.98s -> 11214.10s]  For the guild.
[11214.10s -> 11214.50s]  All right.
[11214.50s -> 11214.90s]  All right.
[11214.90s -> 11216.26s]  Here's where we're going.
[11216.26s -> 11217.54s]  Can you get my sword back?
[11217.54s -> 11218.26s]  Yeah, I got you.
[11218.26s -> 11218.82s]  I got you.
[11218.82s -> 11219.54s]  Thanks.
[11219.54s -> 11220.84s]  Oh, my God.
[11220.84s -> 11221.80s]  This guy was...
[11221.80s -> 11222.76s]  Oh, my Lord.
[11222.76s -> 11224.86s]  Hold on.
[11224.86s -> 11226.58s]  Let me just double check.
[11226.58s -> 11227.06s]  That's a...
[11227.06s -> 11228.42s]  No, that's a chicken kit.
[11228.42s -> 11228.98s]  Sorry.
[11228.98s -> 11229.70s]  Live by the bit.
[11237.85s -> 11238.97s]  Oh, this is so bad.
[11238.97s -> 11239.69s]  I thought it was...
[11239.69s -> 11241.67s]  Oh, this is so bad.
[11241.67s -> 11242.63s]  Oh, thank God.
[11242.63s -> 11243.99s]  Did I just throw out candies?
[11243.99s -> 11246.42s]  Yes, I did.
[11246.42s -> 11247.46s]  Ooh, long sword.
[11250.63s -> 11251.67s]  Oh, there it is.
[11251.67s -> 11255.59s]  I got a heal, though.
[11255.59s -> 11255.99s]  Oh, yeah.
[11255.99s -> 11257.51s]  This is going to be a little hairy here.
[11257.51s -> 11259.10s]  Are you good?
[11259.10s -> 11259.82s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11259.82s -> 11263.77s]  I'm used to hairy.
[11263.77s -> 11264.33s]  Oh, I got...
[11264.33s -> 11265.61s]  I had diamonds on me, too.
[11265.61s -> 11266.41s]  Oh, that's too late.
[11269.06s -> 11270.18s]  It was too fun.
[11273.18s -> 11273.50s]  All right.
[11273.50s -> 11274.06s]  You know what?
[11275.26s -> 11277.02s]  Let's do a gamer one this time.
[11277.02s -> 11277.82s]  Let's go for like a game.
[11277.82s -> 11278.70s]  Play the game.
[11278.70s -> 11280.94s]  We're going to go for gamer mode here.
[11280.94s -> 11281.18s]  Okay.
[11281.18s -> 11282.46s]  It's like weird that you're telling us
[11283.46s -> 11284.42s]  that that's what you're going for,
[11284.42s -> 11285.46s]  but we've been doing it.
[11285.46s -> 11286.90s]  Yeah, but that...
[11286.90s -> 11288.58s]  I mean, obviously, at the end there,
[11288.58s -> 11289.70s]  I literally turned around
[11289.70s -> 11291.30s]  and got hit in the back of the head and died.
[11291.30s -> 11292.74s]  Hey, can I delete my character?
[11292.74s -> 11294.63s]  Just make a new one.
[11294.63s -> 11295.19s]  Sure, yeah.
[11295.19s -> 11296.63s]  Yeah, can I be a ranger?
[11297.27s -> 11298.47s]  Oh my God, please be a ranger.
[11298.47s -> 11299.11s]  I have a purple bow
[11299.11s -> 11301.11s]  that I don't want to deal with selling.
[11301.11s -> 11302.07s]  If you just take it.
[11302.07s -> 11302.95s]  The daggers...
[11302.95s -> 11305.03s]  I like going invisible and being a creepo,
[11305.03s -> 11307.19s]  but I think it would be better to do solo.
[11307.19s -> 11310.10s]  You know, I'm just going to be the ranger guy.
[11310.10s -> 11310.42s]  Yeah.
[11310.42s -> 11312.52s]  No, dude, be our legless.
[11312.52s -> 11312.92s]  Okay.
[11312.92s -> 11313.40s]  Oh, is it?
[11313.40s -> 11313.72s]  Hold on.
[11314.62s -> 11315.50s]  My shop is updated.
[11316.57s -> 11317.29s]  Beautiful.
[11317.29s -> 11322.94s]  Short sword, another Zwiander.
[11322.94s -> 11326.94s]  You can just press class change.
[11326.94s -> 11330.94s]  Wait, what?
[11330.94s -> 11331.75s]  Huh?
[11331.75s -> 11332.79s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, class change,
[11332.79s -> 11333.27s]  and then you can...
[11333.27s -> 11334.39s]  Yeah, you don't have to delete.
[11334.39s -> 11335.83s]  Yeah, you can make a brand new character.
[11335.83s -> 11336.31s]  Dude, this...
[11337.43s -> 11338.39s]  I think I'm going to get this
[11338.39s -> 11339.59s]  and then have this Zwiander.
[11339.59s -> 11343.16s]  Dude, I got to be honest,
[11344.12s -> 11347.32s]  the Zwiander is awful in corridors,
[11347.32s -> 11349.24s]  but I want you to pick
[11349.24s -> 11350.20s]  what's going to make you happy
[11350.20s -> 11350.84s]  because at the end of the day,
[11350.84s -> 11352.18s]  that's all that matters to me.
[11352.18s -> 11353.70s]  Well, so there's a...
[11354.34s -> 11357.66s]  There's a chest piece that's 61 armor.
[11357.66s -> 11359.24s]  It's cloth, though,
[11359.24s -> 11361.94s]  and it's two weapon damage,
[11361.94s -> 11363.46s]  max health, and spell casting,
[11363.46s -> 11364.98s]  which doesn't matter.
[11364.98s -> 11365.54s]  Right.
[11365.54s -> 11366.26s]  Or I could get...
[11366.26s -> 11367.30s]  No, that's 30.
[11367.30s -> 11369.27s]  Got bad rolls on it.
[11371.27s -> 11372.87s]  The long sword you had
[11372.87s -> 11374.95s]  had plus four physical damage
[11374.95s -> 11376.79s]  and 1.5 action speed.
[11376.79s -> 11378.79s]  This is kind of a god roll on a blue.
[11381.85s -> 11382.81s]  Yeah, I think...
[11382.81s -> 11383.69s]  You're going to keep it?
[11383.69s -> 11385.26s]  No, no, no, I can't even use it,
[11385.26s -> 11386.54s]  but I'm going to give it back to you.
[11386.54s -> 11387.58s]  This thing's nuts.
[11387.58s -> 11389.56s]  And you were rocking with it.
[11389.56s -> 11390.20s]  It's five...
[11390.20s -> 11396.49s]  Yeah, this thing would be amazing.
[11396.57s -> 11400.01s]  So this sword versus the purple I have.
[11400.01s -> 11401.50s]  This is plus two agility,
[11401.50s -> 11403.00s]  two resourcefulness,
[11403.00s -> 11404.04s]  a little bit of interaction speed,
[11404.04s -> 11404.84s]  and 53 damage.
[11404.84s -> 11406.20s]  What's the one that I have right now?
[11406.20s -> 11411.50s]  57, three will, max health, and item speed.
[11411.50s -> 11417.24s]  It's probably always just damage, isn't it?
[11417.24s -> 11421.70s]  For the variation on the Zweihander?
[11421.70s -> 11422.26s]  Yeah, like which...
[11423.99s -> 11425.03s]  So I have one as well right now.
[11425.03s -> 11426.55s]  Mine's weapon damage, 55,
[11426.55s -> 11427.27s]  plus two knowledge,
[11427.27s -> 11428.15s]  plus two weapon damage,
[11428.15s -> 11430.57s]  plus three move speed.
[11430.57s -> 11433.66s]  Spear is nice, too, people are saying.
[11433.66s -> 11435.90s]  Spear is a fantastic weapon.
[11435.90s -> 11437.26s]  I think you would really like Spear.
[11437.26s -> 11438.54s]  I don't have 30, though.
[11438.54s -> 11439.82s]  I only have 25.
[11439.82s -> 11440.54s]  Here, trade me.
[11440.54s -> 11442.74s]  I'll just give you the candy that I have.
[11442.74s -> 11443.46s]  Oh, shit.
[11443.46s -> 11444.02s]  Okay.
[11444.02s -> 11445.26s]  Yeah, so go to...
[11445.26s -> 11446.54s]  Do you know how the trade channel works?
[11446.54s -> 11447.10s]  I don't.
[11447.10s -> 11447.82s]  Become a trader.
[11447.82s -> 11448.79s]  So go to...
[11448.79s -> 11449.59s]  Yeah, so go...
[11449.59s -> 11450.63s]  Yeah, you have to spend some gold.
[11450.63s -> 11451.82s]  Hopefully you have it.
[11451.82s -> 11452.70s]  Yeah, I got plenty.
[11452.70s -> 11453.74s]  So just become a trader.
[11453.74s -> 11454.22s]  Right.
[11454.22s -> 11454.54s]  Yep.
[11454.54s -> 11455.82s]  And go to Miss Trade 1.
[11455.82s -> 11456.62s]  I'm going to type in...
[11458.06s -> 11460.74s]  Okay.
[11460.74s -> 11462.90s]  100 subs to kill...
[11462.90s -> 11463.94s]  No, no, don't write that.
[11464.68s -> 11466.60s]  And then you're going to right click that and trade me.
[11466.60s -> 11467.32s]  It should say,
[11468.12s -> 11468.36s]  Oh.
[11468.36s -> 11468.92s]  All right, it's French.
[11469.80s -> 11470.63s]  Fucker.
[11471.99s -> 11476.34s]  Oh, yeah, you're the one with the French name, right?
[11476.34s -> 11476.66s]  Okay.
[11476.66s -> 11477.06s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11477.86s -> 11478.26s]  Thank you.
[11480.39s -> 11482.15s]  Oh, hey, I'm good.
[11482.15s -> 11483.99s]  Can you all invite Sir Dipey?
[11483.99s -> 11488.57s]  Then click the check mark.
[11488.57s -> 11489.69s]  It's like a RuneScape trade.
[11489.69s -> 11490.81s]  Double confirmed.
[11490.81s -> 11495.93s]  Wait, no, that's cancel.
[11497.40s -> 11498.12s]  Did you cancel it?
[11498.12s -> 11498.60s]  No.
[11498.60s -> 11499.70s]  Oh, beautiful.
[11499.70s -> 11500.66s]  Oh, yeah.
[11500.66s -> 11501.54s]  Long one.
[11501.54s -> 11502.97s]  Very cool.
[11502.97s -> 11503.53s]  All right, cool.
[11504.09s -> 11504.41s]  Thank you.
[11504.41s -> 11505.29s]  I appreciate that.
[11505.29s -> 11505.93s]  Of course.
[11505.93s -> 11510.25s]  So now I go to Merchant.
[11510.25s -> 11513.18s]  So the Spear.
[11513.18s -> 11516.25s]  This thing is really, really good.
[11516.25s -> 11518.57s]  Yeah, and I gave you the additional candy
[11518.57s -> 11520.01s]  because I want you to try the Spear.
[11520.01s -> 11520.89s]  It's not for everybody.
[11520.89s -> 11521.85s]  I will tell you that right now.
[11522.41s -> 11526.01s]  But you'd have to be a troglodyte not to use it effectively.
[11526.01s -> 11526.81s]  Whoa.
[11526.81s -> 11527.37s]  Okay, let me...
[11527.93s -> 11528.73s]  Whoa, dude.
[11528.73s -> 11529.45s]  Yeah, I got it.
[11529.45s -> 11530.57s]  I know, I know, I know.
[11530.57s -> 11532.54s]  Is that good?
[11532.54s -> 11535.88s]  Did I got it?
[11535.88s -> 11537.80s]  Yeah, I mean, I would run the Spear.
[11537.80s -> 11538.36s]  I would run it.
[11538.36s -> 11541.54s]  All right, let me put it on.
[11541.54s -> 11543.70s]  If you hate it, then it wasn't my idea.
[11543.70s -> 11545.22s]  All right, okay, this is...
[11545.94s -> 11546.82s]  I'm playing this one.
[11546.82s -> 11548.58s]  No, I'm not going to go over voice chat and be like,
[11548.58s -> 11550.58s]  it's me, now I say...
[11550.58s -> 11552.26s]  No, I'm not losing this.
[11552.26s -> 11554.78s]  I don't know, where is your voice chat key?
[11554.78s -> 11556.94s]  Because you didn't even move to avoid the attack.
[11557.74s -> 11559.66s]  Is it the plus and minus?
[11559.66s -> 11562.94s]  But what did you have to press to do that?
[11564.38s -> 11566.30s]  I wanted them to kill me.
[11566.94s -> 11568.70s]  I wanted this to be yelling at you
[11569.34s -> 11571.50s]  and they take the opportunity to kill me.
[11571.50s -> 11574.70s]  And then they have a story for the rest of their life.
[11574.70s -> 11576.98s]  That is so sweet of you.
[11576.98s -> 11580.39s]  I guess I'm just not content-minded.
[11580.98s -> 11583.05s]  I'm too smooth-brained for that.
[11583.05s -> 11584.57s]  What's your new player name?
[11584.57s -> 11587.61s]  You put it in Discord, Sir Dipey.
[11587.61s -> 11588.79s]  Nice.
[11588.79s -> 11589.27s]  Why?
[11589.27s -> 11591.11s]  But oh, that's your actual name.
[11591.11s -> 11594.50s]  What are you on that tonight for?
[11594.50s -> 11595.86s]  I'm on that always.
[11595.86s -> 11597.62s]  Dipey has been one of my new favorite words.
[11599.99s -> 11601.43s]  Foraging for food, pretty good.
[11605.69s -> 11606.65s]  Is that a perk?
[11608.60s -> 11609.64s]  I run the Sharpshooter.
[11609.64s -> 11611.80s]  I run the headshot one for my first one.
[11611.80s -> 11612.52s]  You get like three heals.
[11612.52s -> 11614.44s]  No, not the perks, the skills.
[11614.44s -> 11614.84s]  It's a heal.
[11614.84s -> 11615.40s]  You got skills.
[11615.88s -> 11617.96s]  Yeah, heal 25 when you forage for food.
[11617.96s -> 11620.28s]  Goated, goated, goated.
[11620.28s -> 11623.29s]  Do not take that off.
[11623.29s -> 11627.43s]  So let me go into...
[11628.25s -> 11630.81s]  I also am bringing you an Arming Sword and a Shortsword.
[11630.81s -> 11633.46s]  I'm bringing you a Shortsword.
[11633.46s -> 11635.78s]  So I guess you can't even buy anything.
[11635.78s -> 11637.14s]  You're a brand new character.
[11637.14s -> 11638.98s]  I'm brand new.
[11638.98s -> 11640.02s]  Should I just buy...
[11640.02s -> 11641.38s]  If I'm going to have the spear on,
[11641.38s -> 11642.90s]  should I buy anything like armor?
[11642.90s -> 11643.94s]  Are we just going to go for it?
[11646.23s -> 11648.31s]  You said this was a real gamer one.
[11648.31s -> 11650.79s]  Yeah, so in theory, if you're going to run...
[11651.75s -> 11654.39s]  Because like barbs can get away with being lazy
[11654.39s -> 11655.51s]  and just having a weapon.
[11655.51s -> 11656.23s]  You cannot.
[11656.23s -> 11656.95s]  You need a kit.
[11658.23s -> 11660.79s]  But then again, armor slows you down.
[11660.79s -> 11662.63s]  So if you want to run faster,
[11662.63s -> 11665.03s]  you might want like a leather kind of thing
[11665.03s -> 11666.97s]  or like a padded situation.
[11666.97s -> 11667.77s]  I like to take...
[11667.77s -> 11669.21s]  Yeah, I want to be able to take some hits.
[11669.21s -> 11669.85s]  I'll get a few things.
[11669.85s -> 11672.41s]  So what I would say is I would check like and just...
[11672.41s -> 11674.09s]  If you have any greens in the shop,
[11674.09s -> 11675.77s]  definitely go for that first.
[11676.81s -> 11678.33s]  But just make sure the attributes make sense.
[11678.33s -> 11680.65s]  And if not, then don't worry about it, honestly.
[11680.65s -> 11681.93s]  And I can check my shop, too.
[11681.93s -> 11684.41s]  Just magic resistance, interaction speed, armor,
[11684.41s -> 11685.54s]  headshot protection.
[11685.54s -> 11686.98s]  Oh, Vinny, thanks for the raid.
[11686.98s -> 11688.18s]  I just saw Vinesauce.
[11688.18s -> 11690.42s]  Thanks, Vinny.
[11690.42s -> 11691.38s]  Thanks for playing earlier, too.
[11691.38s -> 11693.08s]  Yo, Vinster.
[11693.08s -> 11694.12s]  Thank you, Vinny.
[11694.12s -> 11695.69s]  Welcome, everybody.
[11695.69s -> 11697.94s]  We're just kind of playing the game.
[11700.90s -> 11703.94s]  Okay, well, I'll find other stuff, too.
[11703.94s -> 11705.98s]  I was 10 minutes late.
[11705.98s -> 11707.26s]  All right, I actually...
[11707.26s -> 11708.70s]  Let's actually try to win this one.
[11708.70s -> 11710.78s]  Like, because I got to...
[11710.78s -> 11712.06s]  I don't want to lose this thing.
[11712.06s -> 11713.50s]  Where's SirDykeB's shirt?
[11713.50s -> 11714.30s]  That's what I'm wondering.
[11714.30s -> 11717.19s]  Should I put a shirt on?
[11717.27s -> 11718.07s]  I mean, it's...
[11718.07s -> 11720.89s]  I just wondered where it went.
[11720.89s -> 11723.30s]  I mean, when you got a body like this.
[11723.30s -> 11723.78s]  Facts.
[11723.78s -> 11724.42s]  I'm ready.
[11724.42s -> 11724.98s]  All right.
[11724.98s -> 11725.70s]  That's my body.
[11725.70s -> 11726.58s]  My body is ready now.
[11726.58s -> 11726.74s]  All right.
[11726.74s -> 11727.46s]  Let's call it out of here.
[11727.46s -> 11727.78s]  Let's go.
[11727.78s -> 11728.42s]  Let's go.
[11728.42s -> 11739.77s]  Ready up, SirDykeB.
[11739.77s -> 11741.21s]  Aren't you, like, not ready?
[11741.21s -> 11742.86s]  I was waiting for you to be ready.
[11742.86s -> 11745.90s]  Oh, I got...
[11745.90s -> 11746.46s]  Oh, my God.
[11746.46s -> 11750.14s]  I got the best thing for you.
[11750.14s -> 11751.66s]  Don't mess this up for me.
[11751.66s -> 11752.06s]  I'm living...
[11752.06s -> 11753.66s]  The Ranger portrait doesn't look like
[11753.66s -> 11754.62s]  he's drawing an arrow.
[11754.62s -> 11758.15s]  It looks like he's sniffing something.
[11758.15s -> 11759.38s]  There you go.
[11759.38s -> 11760.10s]  Facts.
[11760.10s -> 11760.74s]  True.
[11760.74s -> 11762.09s]  This man's spitting.
[11762.09s -> 11776.17s]  Here, Magona for a smoke.
[11776.17s -> 11776.41s]  All right.
[11776.41s -> 11776.81s]  Let's...
[11777.85s -> 11778.97s]  Clear comms.
[11778.97s -> 11779.75s]  Let's play.
[11780.63s -> 11780.95s]  Yep.
[11780.95s -> 11781.59s]  Here you go.
[11781.59s -> 11783.99s]  Take this.
[11783.99s -> 11785.67s]  This is for you.
[11785.67s -> 11787.83s]  Oh, my goodness gracious.
[11787.83s -> 11788.31s]  Yep.
[11788.31s -> 11788.87s]  Take that.
[11788.87s -> 11789.83s]  Why did I just hear myself?
[11789.83s -> 11791.34s]  That was weird.
[11791.34s -> 11792.62s]  I think you did voice chat.
[11792.62s -> 11792.94s]  Thank you.
[11794.52s -> 11797.24s]  Oh, I did voice chat,
[11797.24s -> 11798.28s]  and it's probably using...
[11799.77s -> 11800.49s]  What?
[11800.49s -> 11804.97s]  My whole ass different...
[11804.97s -> 11805.45s]  Hold on.
[11808.38s -> 11810.14s]  Your desktop audio is coming through.
[11810.98s -> 11813.16s]  That is so funny.
[11813.16s -> 11814.76s]  You listed it as your input device.
[11814.76s -> 11815.48s]  That's brilliant.
[11815.48s -> 11816.97s]  That's such a...
[11816.97s -> 11817.61s]  His whole ass.
[11817.61s -> 11822.26s]  Do that if you can stealth at all times.
[11822.26s -> 11824.33s]  Well, I don't think there's a way to change
[11824.33s -> 11825.37s]  your audio channel.
[11825.37s -> 11826.01s]  Wait, there is.
[11826.01s -> 11826.73s]  You'd have to go to...
[11826.73s -> 11829.48s]  Maybe default in Windows first.
[11829.48s -> 11829.96s]  I can't.
[11831.91s -> 11832.41s]  Yikes.
[11836.54s -> 11838.38s]  I guess we're gonna have to be super gamers.
[11838.38s -> 11840.04s]  This thing's fun.
[11840.04s -> 11840.84s]  Let me make sure.
[11842.44s -> 11843.24s]  You feel the power now?
[11843.24s -> 11844.52s]  You feel the power of the perp?
[11844.52s -> 11845.02s]  Yeah.
[11845.83s -> 11847.91s]  This room is kind of awful, but...
[11847.91s -> 11849.43s]  It's literally the worst.
[11849.43s -> 11850.87s]  There's a bunch of skeeters here.
[11850.87s -> 11852.31s]  I don't like mosquitoes on by you, but...
[11852.31s -> 11853.75s]  Oh, he's just turning around.
[11853.75s -> 11854.25s]  Yeah.
[11854.87s -> 11856.54s]  Really think of the rain.
[11856.54s -> 11857.10s]  Appreciate that.
[11857.10s -> 11858.86s]  Yeah, what's the range?
[11858.86s -> 11859.34s]  Oh, my God.
[11860.22s -> 11861.74s]  She's got some range on her.
[11861.74s -> 11862.14s]  Hold on.
[11862.14s -> 11863.51s]  Watch out.
[11863.51s -> 11864.23s]  Watching.
[11864.23s -> 11864.95s]  How far is it?
[11864.95s -> 11867.21s]  Close, close, close.
[11867.93s -> 11868.73s]  Oh, that's...
[11869.37s -> 11870.97s]  That is actually pretty far.
[11870.97s -> 11871.29s]  Damn.
[11871.29s -> 11874.22s]  Oh, yeah.
[11874.22s -> 11874.78s]  We can.
[11874.78s -> 11875.26s]  Yes.
[11875.26s -> 11876.34s]  Yes.
[11876.34s -> 11876.58s]  Okay.
[11876.58s -> 11879.13s]  We can also hear ourself again, too.
[11879.13s -> 11879.53s]  Could you?
[11879.53s -> 11880.09s]  Wait, really?
[11880.09s -> 11880.41s]  Yeah.
[11880.41s -> 11882.47s]  I heard you coming through him.
[11882.47s -> 11883.51s]  No, he talked.
[11883.51s -> 11884.15s]  I talked as well.
[11884.15s -> 11884.71s]  Oh, you talked.
[11884.71s -> 11885.21s]  Okay.
[11889.91s -> 11891.64s]  All right.
[11891.64s -> 11893.08s]  Oh, that is a trap.
[11893.08s -> 11893.32s]  Yeah.
[11893.32s -> 11893.96s]  That's a trap room.
[11893.96s -> 11895.56s]  And you have to pick pocket to get that.
[11895.56s -> 11896.28s]  So don't even bother.
[11896.28s -> 11897.00s]  But kill these guys.
[11897.00s -> 11898.44s]  These guys usually have pendants.
[11898.44s -> 11899.16s]  Oh, my God.
[11899.16s -> 11900.28s]  It came from...
[11900.28s -> 11905.19s]  What the...
[11905.19s -> 11906.54s]  Oh, you just hit me.
[11906.54s -> 11907.34s]  Do I have to re...
[11908.36s -> 11909.16s]  Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[11909.16s -> 11910.68s]  Don't die, don't die.
[11910.68s -> 11911.16s]  Dude.
[11911.16s -> 11912.84s]  This is a real gamer one, dude.
[11912.84s -> 11913.40s]  I don't...
[11913.40s -> 11914.92s]  I think you hit me with your axe.
[11914.92s -> 11915.40s]  I think I did.
[11915.40s -> 11916.36s]  I didn't.
[11916.36s -> 11916.68s]  I think it...
[11916.68s -> 11917.48s]  No, it was me.
[11917.48s -> 11917.96s]  It's my fault.
[11917.96s -> 11921.80s]  I fired one arrow and it is inside this skull.
[11921.80s -> 11923.32s]  But good news is you have second wind
[11923.32s -> 11924.92s]  and we also get a campfire from the ranger.
[11924.92s -> 11925.56s]  So everything's fine.
[11925.56s -> 11926.20s]  I didn't do anything wrong.
[11926.20s -> 11926.76s]  No, no.
[11926.76s -> 11927.88s]  We're good, we're good.
[11927.88s -> 11928.52s]  No, we're good.
[11928.52s -> 11929.32s]  We're good.
[11929.32s -> 11930.20s]  Do any of you guys have...
[11930.20s -> 11930.36s]  Oh, wait.
[11930.36s -> 11931.72s]  There's a health thing over here.
[11931.72s -> 11931.88s]  Sorry.
[11931.88s -> 11932.44s]  Oh, shit.
[11933.08s -> 11936.52s]  Where you're crouching and it wants you to press F to interact.
[11936.52s -> 11937.56s]  We can't do both.
[11937.56s -> 11937.88s]  Hold on.
[11937.88s -> 11939.24s]  German, no!
[11939.24s -> 11939.88s]  German, no!
[11939.88s -> 11940.60s]  What's wrong?
[11940.60s -> 11941.16s]  What's going on?
[11943.51s -> 11944.23s]  Skelly.
[11944.23s -> 11945.03s]  Where did he come from?
[11945.03s -> 11945.43s]  Where does...
[11945.43s -> 11945.75s]  All right.
[11945.75s -> 11946.39s]  Can we kill this?
[11947.03s -> 11947.59s]  Yeah, we can kill it.
[11947.59s -> 11948.07s]  We can kill it.
[11948.07s -> 11948.79s]  But don't die.
[11949.51s -> 11950.39s]  We can kill if you don't die.
[11950.95s -> 11951.75s]  Does that make sense?
[11952.39s -> 11953.51s]  I think that makes sense.
[11956.02s -> 11956.98s]  I've run the numbers.
[11956.98s -> 11958.18s]  If you don't die, we can kill it.
[11961.74s -> 11962.46s]  Oh, my God.
[11967.26s -> 11968.62s]  I have my fear again in a second.
[11970.33s -> 11971.85s]  That's a lot of enemies, friends.
[11975.05s -> 11977.37s]  I don't really know how my character works yet.
[11977.37s -> 11977.93s]  Okay, hold on.
[11977.93s -> 11978.65s]  I'm fearing them away.
[11979.37s -> 11980.74s]  Take this time to run.
[11980.74s -> 11981.46s]  Take this time to run.
[11982.73s -> 11983.21s]  I'm dead.
[11983.21s -> 11983.69s]  Oh, my God.
[11983.69s -> 11984.09s]  Oh, my God.
[11984.09s -> 11984.57s]  I died.
[11984.57s -> 11985.37s]  Oh, I actually died.
[11985.37s -> 11986.49s]  I don't know what I was doing.
[11986.49s -> 11987.37s]  I don't know why I did that.
[11987.37s -> 11987.93s]  I thought...
[11987.93s -> 11988.49s]  I thought...
[11988.49s -> 11989.37s]  Because you said you feared him.
[11989.37s -> 11990.17s]  I was like, okay, they feared.
[11990.17s -> 11991.13s]  I can take this and run.
[11991.93s -> 11992.57s]  Oh, my God.
[11992.57s -> 11993.21s]  Oh, my God.
[11993.37s -> 11994.25s]  This is the worst day ever.
[11994.25s -> 11994.97s]  No, that's bad.
[11994.97s -> 11995.61s]  That's really bad.
[11995.61s -> 11996.41s]  I thought I had time.
[11996.41s -> 11997.05s]  That's the champion man.
[11997.05s -> 11997.77s]  That's the problem.
[11999.21s -> 11999.69s]  Oh, no.
[11999.69s -> 12002.25s]  Start shooting the champion with the arrows.
[12002.25s -> 12002.89s]  The bow.
[12002.89s -> 12003.53s]  I am.
[12003.53s -> 12005.61s]  I don't want to hit you because Jerma is going to say that I hit him.
[12005.61s -> 12006.09s]  No, I understand.
[12006.09s -> 12007.37s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[12007.37s -> 12007.69s]  It's okay.
[12007.69s -> 12008.09s]  It's okay.
[12008.09s -> 12008.73s]  Everyone relax.
[12008.73s -> 12009.21s]  Good comms.
[12009.21s -> 12009.69s]  Team comms.
[12009.69s -> 12010.25s]  Team comms.
[12010.25s -> 12011.13s]  I just thought...
[12011.13s -> 12012.89s]  I thought that everybody was feared over there
[12012.89s -> 12014.33s]  and I was like, I have two or three seconds.
[12014.33s -> 12015.45s]  I get it.
[12015.45s -> 12016.17s]  He's on me.
[12016.17s -> 12018.01s]  I'm going to walk up here and I'm going to lay a trap.
[12018.89s -> 12020.73s]  And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to swing on his ass.
[12021.29s -> 12022.92s]  Come here, baby.
[12022.92s -> 12025.16s]  Are we going to get Jerma's ass here?
[12025.16s -> 12025.80s]  Oh, Jesus.
[12031.72s -> 12032.92s]  This is a bad run.
[12032.92s -> 12034.68s]  This is not a good run.
[12034.68s -> 12035.88s]  This is a very bad one.
[12038.58s -> 12046.89s]  Okay, you know how...
[12046.89s -> 12047.77s]  All right.
[12047.77s -> 12048.17s]  Do you know how...
[12048.17s -> 12049.45s]  That's a real gamer one.
[12049.45s -> 12052.18s]  Do you know how shit just like falls apart
[12052.18s -> 12054.74s]  and you kind of just don't even know how or why?
[12056.65s -> 12058.89s]  I don't even know what happened.
[12058.89s -> 12061.21s]  It just fell apart so quickly.
[12061.21s -> 12065.37s]  It was just abrupt chaos that we just couldn't fucking solve.
[12067.26s -> 12069.74s]  Once it started going, it just wouldn't stop, man.
[12071.58s -> 12073.26s]  It's just like, oh, there's a heal over there.
[12073.26s -> 12073.82s]  Oh, it's okay.
[12073.82s -> 12077.58s]  We have like five aggroed and there's 10.
[12077.58s -> 12080.06s]  I think I can get this heal off and then it's just over.
[12080.06s -> 12084.57s]  The whole thing just falls apart and I got...
[12084.57s -> 12084.97s]  It's okay.
[12084.97s -> 12087.34s]  I still got this way under.
[12087.34s -> 12088.92s]  You caused that?
[12089.00s -> 12094.04s]  No, what caused it was the big champion skeleton existed
[12094.04s -> 12096.60s]  and we didn't all just run away at the same time.
[12098.70s -> 12101.05s]  The guild is fucking falling apart.
[12101.05s -> 12102.09s]  I hate this guild.
[12102.09s -> 12103.93s]  I'm going to go get water because you guys are going to like
[12104.65s -> 12106.49s]  re-ready your characters for another 20 minutes.
[12107.21s -> 12110.25s]  Can you tell me who the fuck you're working for, Jerma?
[12110.25s -> 12112.73s]  Who hired you to ruin my barb legacy?
[12112.73s -> 12114.97s]  Oh, you don't have any subs I got for that one.
[12114.97s -> 12118.25s]  You don't have any idea?
[12118.25s -> 12118.75s]  Zero.
[12120.92s -> 12122.04s]  I still have five purple holes.
[12122.04s -> 12123.18s]  Let's go.
[12123.18s -> 12125.58s]  Okay, actually I do need to pee.
[12125.58s -> 12126.38s]  I don't want to get some water.
[12126.38s -> 12127.66s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12129.10s -> 12130.46s]  At least it was funny.
[12131.34s -> 12133.50s]  No, no, it's fucking hilarious.
[12133.50s -> 12135.50s]  It was all my fault.
[12135.50s -> 12137.26s]  Do I take the L on this one?
[12137.26s -> 12140.46s]  I would say I didn't come that there was a skelly champion
[12140.46s -> 12142.14s]  coming soon enough for you.
[12142.14s -> 12143.74s]  I didn't recognize that he was aggroed on you.
[12143.74s -> 12146.78s]  I thought he was on me and I will take the blame initially.
[12147.42s -> 12152.97s]  After that, everything was you.
[12152.97s -> 12153.61s]  Respect.
[12153.61s -> 12156.81s]  Oh, it was fun though.
[12156.81s -> 12158.09s]  That's all that matters.
[12158.09s -> 12158.81s]  No, I had a great time.
[12158.81s -> 12160.01s]  It was fucking hilarious.
[12160.01s -> 12163.26s]  Yeah, I demoted you in the guild hall.
[12163.26s -> 12163.66s]  That's fine.
[12163.66s -> 12165.90s]  You don't have access to guild stash anymore, man.
[12165.90s -> 12166.38s]  That's fine.
[12166.38s -> 12168.46s]  I already cleaned the bank out before you did that.
[12171.56s -> 12172.36s]  Look at all this.
[12173.24s -> 12174.66s]  I mean, you're still in the guild.
[12175.62s -> 12176.66s]  Take a look at all this.
[12176.66s -> 12177.38s]  A WoW guild?
[12178.10s -> 12180.70s]  Okay, yeah, I'll bear it back.
[12180.70s -> 12181.50s]  I gotta pee.
[12181.50s -> 12186.97s]  Beer pee.
[12475.32s -> 12496.70s]  Hello?
[12496.70s -> 12497.72s]  Anybody there?
[12497.72s -> 12500.63s]  How are we?
[12500.63s -> 12502.25s]  Hello, hello, hello.
[12502.25s -> 12504.04s]  All right.
[12504.04s -> 12506.04s]  Well, that was good.
[12506.04s -> 12509.67s]  That was a decent warm up round.
[12509.67s -> 12511.48s]  Yeah, I think we're the guild now.
[12511.64s -> 12512.60s]  How are you guys doing on time?
[12514.55s -> 12516.31s]  I will be playing this until 5 a.m.
[12516.31s -> 12517.19s]  I kid you not.
[12518.39s -> 12524.23s]  What about Mr. Stirr?
[12524.23s -> 12525.11s]  I think he's...
[12525.11s -> 12525.59s]  Let's go.
[12526.31s -> 12527.91s]  Honest to goodness, let's play.
[12527.91s -> 12528.39s]  Okay.
[12528.39s -> 12531.80s]  Stirr, how are you on time?
[12531.80s -> 12533.80s]  Are you good for a little bit longer?
[12533.80s -> 12537.48s]  I'd say I got like a week left before the worms take me.
[12537.48s -> 12540.47s]  Well, I mean tonight.
[12540.47s -> 12544.66s]  Oh, I don't know.
[12544.66s -> 12545.16s]  Okay.
[12546.33s -> 12547.78s]  I'm in it till I'm not.
[12547.78s -> 12548.02s]  Okay.
[12548.02s -> 12548.74s]  Honest to goodness.
[12549.54s -> 12551.78s]  Now, I might make a suggestion.
[12551.78s -> 12554.26s]  I can keep on going, Barb, if you'd like.
[12554.26s -> 12556.54s]  I can also play cleric.
[12556.54s -> 12558.46s]  If you guys wanted to get some more action,
[12558.46s -> 12563.30s]  a little bit more blood on your swords and whatnot.
[12563.30s -> 12566.90s]  I would like to be a ranger behind your big axe though.
[12566.90s -> 12567.46s]  No, I understand.
[12567.46s -> 12569.96s]  I'll keep axing.
[12569.96s -> 12571.80s]  Because otherwise our frontliner is the guy
[12571.80s -> 12574.12s]  who like comedically turns around to talk to us.
[12574.68s -> 12576.36s]  And I can't trust that.
[12576.36s -> 12577.56s]  Yeah, but that's...
[12577.56s -> 12579.80s]  It's funny though.
[12579.80s -> 12581.24s]  One time.
[12581.24s -> 12583.40s]  But like my life depends on it.
[12584.97s -> 12586.02s]  Understandable.
[12586.02s -> 12588.10s]  Get in there with your big axe.
[12588.10s -> 12590.82s]  Hey, let me get 50 subs to stab my friend
[12590.82s -> 12592.90s]  I'm streaming with in the head till he dies.
[12592.90s -> 12593.78s]  Dude, like...
[12593.78s -> 12594.42s]  But it's me.
[12594.42s -> 12595.06s]  You started it.
[12595.06s -> 12596.42s]  It's me.
[12596.42s -> 12598.34s]  That's the comedy one.
[12598.34s -> 12599.54s]  I didn't start that.
[12602.79s -> 12605.67s]  There was someone asking for 100 who wasn't me first.
[12605.67s -> 12606.39s]  That's true.
[12607.03s -> 12607.75s]  That's very true.
[12607.75s -> 12610.55s]  Again, a lot of this isn't actually me.
[12610.55s -> 12613.08s]  You just capitalized on it.
[12613.08s -> 12614.04s]  You just capitalized on it.
[12614.04s -> 12615.38s]  All right, you guys ready?
[12615.38s -> 12616.78s]  Yeah.
[12616.78s -> 12618.06s]  Fuck the communists.
[12618.06s -> 12618.94s]  All right, let's go.
[12618.94s -> 12620.47s]  That's what I've always said.
[12620.47s -> 12621.11s]  Exactly.
[12621.11s -> 12621.83s]  Honest to goodness.
[12621.83s -> 12627.66s]  Let's go.
[12627.66s -> 12629.10s]  Dude, are you still mad, dude?
[12629.10s -> 12630.38s]  You still suck at it, bro.
[12630.38s -> 12631.98s]  Everybody in this lot...
[12631.98s -> 12635.85s]  You don't even have time to talk shit.
[12635.85s -> 12637.85s]  Yeah, usually I tell them I'm going to kill everybody
[12637.85s -> 12640.18s]  and then I didn't do that today.
[12640.18s -> 12641.94s]  So this might be a scuffed run.
[12641.94s -> 12647.29s]  I think we're going to be fine.
[12650.38s -> 12652.38s]  I like your way of thinking.
[12652.38s -> 12653.98s]  Beware of interlopers.
[12653.98s -> 12660.38s]  Honest to goodness, we're going to be fine.
[12660.38s -> 12662.78s]  All right, I'm the commanding officer on this mission.
[12662.78s -> 12664.70s]  Leave the fucking lights on so I can hitch...
[12664.70s -> 12666.54s]  Oh, wait, you have no reason to turn off lights now.
[12666.54s -> 12667.90s]  Thank the fucking Lord.
[12670.65s -> 12673.77s]  If I see a light go off, dude, I'm going to know.
[12673.77s -> 12674.41s]  He's going to lose it.
[12677.83s -> 12678.55s]  Praise Jesus.
[12680.07s -> 12681.67s]  It's the arrows bigger than the thing.
[12682.49s -> 12682.97s]  This...
[12682.97s -> 12684.01s]  Wait, wait, I have people already.
[12684.01s -> 12685.05s]  Bro, there are players immediately.
[12685.05s -> 12686.09s]  There are players immediately.
[12686.09s -> 12688.09s]  Oh, typey.
[12688.09s -> 12696.49s]  Oh, good, good, good, good, good.
[12696.49s -> 12697.13s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[12697.13s -> 12697.93s]  Your friend's dead.
[12697.93s -> 12698.89s]  Just come here, just come here.
[12698.89s -> 12699.77s]  The run's over, dude.
[12699.77s -> 12700.57s]  The run's over, bro.
[12700.57s -> 12701.05s]  The run's over.
[12701.05s -> 12701.77s]  Don't listen to him.
[12701.77s -> 12702.65s]  Don't listen to him.
[12702.65s -> 12704.33s]  You should be fighting to the very end.
[12704.33s -> 12705.53s]  Like, that's exactly...
[12705.53s -> 12706.65s]  Good on you, seriously.
[12709.21s -> 12709.93s]  What?
[12709.93s -> 12711.77s]  Jeremy, you caused this.
[12711.77s -> 12712.49s]  I didn't do anything.
[12714.38s -> 12715.58s]  Exactly what I was talking about.
[12715.58s -> 12717.02s]  Exactly what I was talking about.
[12717.02s -> 12717.66s]  You deserve it.
[12727.98s -> 12730.46s]  He hit me through the fucking fence.
[12730.46s -> 12731.66s]  He hit me through the...
[12731.66s -> 12733.34s]  He stabbed me through the fucking...
[12740.38s -> 12740.94s]  I like...
[12740.94s -> 12742.70s]  I don't know how my character works yet.
[12742.70s -> 12744.14s]  I still have so many questions.
[12748.71s -> 12749.03s]  You got...
[12749.03s -> 12749.99s]  This is a government operation.
[12749.99s -> 12752.47s]  Dude, you got obliterated, by the way.
[12752.47s -> 12755.51s]  You turned to look and see down the hall,
[12755.51s -> 12757.83s]  and three arrows instantly killed you.
[12758.39s -> 12759.99s]  Yeah, I know.
[12759.99s -> 12760.55s]  Wait, wait.
[12760.55s -> 12761.03s]  All right, all right.
[12761.75s -> 12762.79s]  What's your skill?
[12762.79s -> 12763.51s]  What's your other skill?
[12763.51s -> 12765.91s]  It needs to be the quick shot, the try shot.
[12765.91s -> 12767.03s]  Yeah, I got quick shot.
[12767.83s -> 12770.31s]  I just want to know if I have to get my arrows back
[12770.31s -> 12771.11s]  and how many I have.
[12771.11s -> 12771.59s]  No, no, no.
[12771.59s -> 12772.63s]  You just reload.
[12772.63s -> 12773.83s]  You have unlimited arrows.
[12773.83s -> 12774.15s]  Okay.
[12774.15s -> 12775.19s]  And if you hit...
[12775.19s -> 12776.65s]  If you just hit head...
[12776.65s -> 12779.05s]  Honest to goodness, can we ready up?
[12779.05s -> 12780.17s]  No, I can't run.
[12780.17s -> 12782.65s]  The bar doesn't make sense without a different weapon.
[12782.65s -> 12784.89s]  So I can actually equip and then I have to get healing.
[12784.89s -> 12786.26s]  Otherwise, I die.
[12786.26s -> 12786.58s]  All right.
[12786.58s -> 12787.14s]  Okay.
[12787.14s -> 12788.26s]  I have a solution.
[12792.65s -> 12795.05s]  Turning off voice chat so I don't have the temptation
[12795.05s -> 12796.09s]  to be like, hey, let me talk to you
[12796.09s -> 12797.98s]  and let's have like a funny thing.
[12797.98s -> 12799.34s]  No, you can talk to them.
[12799.34s -> 12801.74s]  No, no, talk to them, talk to them, talk to them.
[12801.74s -> 12801.82s]  No.
[12801.82s -> 12802.38s]  We should do...
[12802.38s -> 12804.06s]  That way I can laugh while I'm dying.
[12804.06s -> 12804.54s]  Because I'm dying anyway.
[12804.54s -> 12806.22s]  We should mute Discord and only talk in game.
[12806.78s -> 12807.82s]  Oh, that's brilliant.
[12807.82s -> 12808.06s]  No.
[12809.90s -> 12811.42s]  I want to role play around.
[12811.42s -> 12812.54s]  Fine, let's role play.
[12812.54s -> 12813.74s]  You want to role play around?
[12813.74s -> 12814.46s]  Role play around.
[12814.46s -> 12815.18s]  Okay.
[12815.18s -> 12816.14s]  See you guys later.
[12816.14s -> 12817.56s]  All right, they're muted.
[12822.58s -> 12832.46s]  Okay.
[12832.46s -> 12836.14s]  I've got to figure out the right voice for this.
[12836.78s -> 12838.38s]  Oh, I thought...
[12838.38s -> 12839.42s]  The thing is, I think...
[12840.14s -> 12847.05s]  That's a good one.
[12847.05s -> 12848.17s]  Well, I believe.
[12848.81s -> 12854.38s]  I think that's an idea for me.
[12855.02s -> 12856.47s]  I think I'm going to go with this.
[12857.93s -> 12859.45s]  Sounds about right to me.
[12859.45s -> 12867.59s]  Okay.
[12867.59s -> 12872.68s]  Why can't I hear anyone talking?
[12872.68s -> 12883.69s]  Oh, I'd like to see you try.
[12883.69s -> 12898.62s]  Why is nobody talking?
[12898.62s -> 12917.29s]  Nobody's talking.
[12917.29s -> 12925.86s]  Hello.
[12926.26s -> 12928.38s]  Hello.
[12928.38s -> 12932.54s]  Oh, good thing I can hear you now.
[12932.54s -> 12934.06s]  Greetings for our first adventure.
[12934.06s -> 12934.78s]  Hello.
[12934.78s -> 12936.42s]  Can you hear me?
[12936.42s -> 12937.46s]  I am speaking.
[12937.46s -> 12938.42s]  Hello, wizard.
[12938.42s -> 12940.25s]  Watch out for the wizards.
[12942.33s -> 12943.77s]  Great, let's speak.
[12943.77s -> 12948.09s]  Spiders.
[12948.89s -> 12951.40s]  We have to take out the jaw.
[12951.40s -> 12955.16s]  Yeah, the jaw in the corner is the way to stop the spider.
[12955.16s -> 12958.31s]  Be careful behind you.
[12958.31s -> 12961.74s]  Scythe is full.
[12961.74s -> 12963.10s]  Oh, very interesting.
[12963.10s -> 12965.11s]  I'm glad you've told us that.
[12965.11s -> 12966.47s]  More than five times today.
[12966.47s -> 12969.59s]  They're speaking at the braemers.
[12969.59s -> 12970.95s]  Ah, I can't hear you.
[12970.95s -> 12973.43s]  Your helmet muffles your voice.
[12973.43s -> 12977.64s]  Are we ready to continue down this hallway, please?
[12978.60s -> 12979.48s]  Listen to me, boys.
[12979.48s -> 12980.68s]  Boys, listen.
[12980.68s -> 12982.04s]  Oh, why do I sound so smart?
[12983.00s -> 12985.24s]  There's exquisitely leaves over here in the library.
[12985.24s -> 12986.84s]  Come here, come here.
[12986.84s -> 12988.52s]  Oh, the library, yes.
[12988.52s -> 12990.20s]  Plenty of books.
[12993.48s -> 12995.08s]  I remember reading this one.
[12996.28s -> 12997.40s]  That's a good one.
[12997.40s -> 13000.84s]  This is an encyclopedia of all the dragons that are in this world.
[13000.84s -> 13002.10s]  Have you read it?
[13002.10s -> 13012.06s]  The dragon, despite my upbringing, I can't read.
[13012.06s -> 13012.78s]  Those are made.
[13012.78s -> 13015.02s]  We must go to fight to loot.
[13015.02s -> 13015.66s]  Made here.
[13027.11s -> 13028.07s]  Nice, nice.
[13028.07s -> 13028.63s]  Excellent.
[13028.63s -> 13029.03s]  Excellent.
[13029.03s -> 13030.23s]  Below me.
[13030.23s -> 13030.63s]  Excellent.
[13030.63s -> 13031.03s]  Below.
[13031.03s -> 13032.23s]  Crystal sword here.
[13032.79s -> 13035.58s]  It was top drawer, if I must say.
[13035.58s -> 13042.46s]  I'm going to go over here.
[13042.46s -> 13045.98s]  I'm going to get the spider into loafers, you say.
[13046.62s -> 13050.58s]  I need to get rid of this.
[13061.34s -> 13066.81s]  So, Diope, what are you talking about?
[13066.81s -> 13067.93s]  Make sure you get the jewels.
[13069.61s -> 13075.11s]  Turn oblivion music on.
[13075.75s -> 13076.07s]  Okay.
[13088.70s -> 13089.90s]  Jesus Christ!
[13094.41s -> 13095.29s]  What the fuck?
[13095.29s -> 13098.46s]  My God, why was it like that?
[13099.58s -> 13100.78s]  Oh, my God.
[13104.44s -> 13105.48s]  Oh, my goodness.
[13107.58s -> 13109.42s]  Sorry, a very loud thing happened.
[13120.50s -> 13122.02s]  Why is it so loud?
[13122.02s -> 13122.66s]  I don't get it.
[13131.80s -> 13132.76s]  Demons of the mind.
[13134.97s -> 13135.77s]  Look at his eyes.
[13136.41s -> 13137.53s]  There's not much behind me.
[13137.53s -> 13139.05s]  All right, gentlemen, I'm ready.
[13139.05s -> 13140.33s]  I'm a female.
[13140.33s -> 13140.97s]  I'm a female.
[13144.10s -> 13145.06s]  Yes, I am ready.
[13146.38s -> 13146.94s]  Onwards.
[13149.35s -> 13150.71s]  Bass, get your wits about you.
[13151.59s -> 13152.39s]  I'm very on.
[13152.39s -> 13152.95s]  Various challenges.
[13153.75s -> 13154.47s]  All right.
[13154.47s -> 13155.67s]  Are we ready to take off?
[13155.67s -> 13156.23s]  And demons.
[13157.90s -> 13158.38s]  Here we go.
[13158.38s -> 13158.86s]  Let's go.
[13159.78s -> 13160.50s]  Here we go.
[13160.50s -> 13161.38s]  This way, follow me.
[13161.38s -> 13163.98s]  This is a room, squiz of treasures.
[13167.93s -> 13170.62s]  Long ago, this exact cave.
[13171.42s -> 13177.74s]  It was filled with treasures, laughter, music, family.
[13177.74s -> 13179.02s]  I've been here before.
[13179.02s -> 13179.98s]  Yes, many times.
[13179.98s -> 13180.78s]  This is my home.
[13180.78s -> 13182.14s]  I've been here recently.
[13182.78s -> 13183.50s]  Very recently.
[13184.86s -> 13190.57s]  But now, ever since the dragon fire, it's all but nothing.
[13195.94s -> 13197.46s]  Footsteps in the distance.
[13197.46s -> 13200.97s]  The dark sounds upon the cement.
[13201.99s -> 13204.07s]  I don't know what could be in these halls,
[13204.07s -> 13206.52s]  but prepare for anything.
[13211.80s -> 13213.59s]  Wait a minute.
[13213.67s -> 13216.46s]  Alas, a room full of treasures.
[13217.38s -> 13218.34s]  Oh, yes.
[13218.34s -> 13219.62s]  I just remembered.
[13219.62s -> 13219.94s]  What is it?
[13219.94s -> 13221.62s]  I left my oven on.
[13221.62s -> 13223.14s]  There be an archer.
[13223.14s -> 13223.70s]  Watch out.
[13224.58s -> 13226.26s]  It'll get you outside.
[13226.26s -> 13229.62s]  What have they done to my father's old study?
[13232.42s -> 13237.13s]  These absolute disgusting zombies,
[13237.13s -> 13241.14s]  and probably too dangerous in here now.
[13241.94s -> 13243.38s]  Me, don't get too close.
[13245.11s -> 13245.75s]  It's a diaphe.
[13247.06s -> 13247.86s]  You had a-
[13247.86s -> 13250.34s]  I have remembered ovens weren't invented yet.
[13250.34s -> 13250.98s]  That's correct.
[13250.98s -> 13257.14s]  I don't know why you're saying these things this way.
[13260.84s -> 13266.58s]  Long ago, my father created a series of traps
[13267.22s -> 13270.42s]  to protect this very room and these very halls
[13270.42s -> 13272.58s]  from interlopers like us.
[13272.58s -> 13275.46s]  It's ironic considering that we're trying to-
[13275.46s -> 13276.34s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[13276.98s -> 13277.86s]  I'm sorry.
[13277.86s -> 13281.06s]  What were we thinking coming in here without shoes?
[13281.06s -> 13282.10s]  Yes, it's very strange.
[13282.10s -> 13282.90s]  I have shoes.
[13283.78s -> 13286.52s]  It's like men being unprepared.
[13286.52s -> 13289.00s]  We have shoes right here.
[13289.00s -> 13289.88s]  If you want shoes,
[13290.52s -> 13295.35s]  I want to feel the cold stone on my bare feet.
[13295.35s -> 13298.34s]  Curious.
[13298.34s -> 13300.10s]  Very curious indeed.
[13300.10s -> 13303.46s]  Trying to get to my old room.
[13303.46s -> 13308.46s]  Unfortunately, it's been destroyed.
[13308.46s -> 13310.36s]  You know, did you live here?
[13310.36s -> 13311.24s]  I did.
[13311.24s -> 13312.04s]  Many years ago.
[13314.33s -> 13315.05s]  Skeleton.
[13315.05s -> 13315.53s]  Skeleton.
[13315.53s -> 13316.97s]  We reanimated undead.
[13318.01s -> 13318.65s]  Surprise it.
[13319.21s -> 13320.49s]  Shoot his face.
[13321.77s -> 13324.09s]  I live in dreams.
[13325.13s -> 13325.93s]  Oh, my neck.
[13327.05s -> 13327.93s]  Oh, my neck.
[13327.93s -> 13334.81s]  Oh, that hurt.
[13337.29s -> 13338.41s]  Attack, please.
[13341.85s -> 13344.30s]  Never mind.
[13344.30s -> 13345.26s]  We're not going down there.
[13347.26s -> 13347.98s]  It's a diapoe.
[13352.26s -> 13353.06s]  It's a diapoe.
[13353.70s -> 13358.49s]  It's very scary coming down these halls once again.
[13359.29s -> 13361.34s]  It's a diapoe.
[13361.34s -> 13361.98s]  What's happening?
[13365.69s -> 13366.57s]  Adventure, a friend.
[13366.57s -> 13367.53s]  What are you doing?
[13367.53s -> 13368.41s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[13369.45s -> 13370.97s]  Do you have a history in these halls as well?
[13374.92s -> 13377.64s]  I must know if there are other people here.
[13377.64s -> 13379.16s]  My family depends on it.
[13383.40s -> 13383.88s]  Wizard.
[13386.66s -> 13387.14s]  Wizard.
[13389.13s -> 13391.85s]  Oh, another one lost to the dungeon.
[13393.21s -> 13394.25s]  Where did that wizard go?
[13399.11s -> 13400.07s]  There was a wizard here,
[13400.07s -> 13401.75s]  and he might have the secrets of my family.
[13402.31s -> 13404.47s]  It could even be somebody from my family.
[13405.78s -> 13406.42s]  We must know.
[13406.42s -> 13407.06s]  We must find...
[13410.82s -> 13411.22s]  Hello?
[13412.50s -> 13413.38s]  Wizard, it's all right.
[13416.74s -> 13417.62s]  He's a blacksmith.
[13419.53s -> 13422.01s]  He built this entire castle with his bare hands.
[13422.57s -> 13424.10s]  I don't want to...
[13432.28s -> 13433.64s]  He was paid very well.
[13433.64s -> 13437.88s]  Fortunately, he didn't make it through the war.
[13437.88s -> 13439.40s]  The war, he did not make it through the war.
[13439.40s -> 13440.84s]  Have you seen our friends today?
[13441.48s -> 13442.60s]  Do you know where he is?
[13443.72s -> 13448.18s]  Adventurer, do you have business in these halls?
[13448.18s -> 13449.86s]  I am looking for an exit.
[13449.86s -> 13451.94s]  Perhaps there will be an exit for all of us.
[13451.94s -> 13453.22s]  There will be, potentially.
[13455.22s -> 13456.26s]  How did you get in?
[13456.26s -> 13456.98s]  What's your name?
[13457.62s -> 13458.50s]  What is your name, Traveller?
[13458.50s -> 13460.66s]  The butler let me in.
[13460.66s -> 13462.18s]  You see, I work here,
[13462.18s -> 13464.98s]  but I've came through a lot on my way out.
[13465.94s -> 13467.14s]  Another adventurer, please.
[13467.78s -> 13468.82s]  Let us all come together
[13468.82s -> 13470.10s]  and discuss what's happening here.
[13470.10s -> 13472.82s]  I'm trying to find my family's secrets.
[13474.90s -> 13475.78s]  There was an accident.
[13475.78s -> 13476.50s]  I didn't mean it.
[13476.50s -> 13477.46s]  I'm sorry.
[13477.46s -> 13491.69s]  A blue portal has arrived.
[13491.69s -> 13492.17s]  All right.
[13492.81s -> 13495.77s]  If there are any interlopers here in my family's castle,
[13495.77s -> 13498.98s]  just be aware I am not going to go down so easily.
[13498.98s -> 13500.82s]  My father built this tunnel,
[13500.82s -> 13503.14s]  built these halls with his bare hands.
[13503.14s -> 13504.79s]  Just so you know,
[13504.79s -> 13506.55s]  I am ready to fight for my family
[13506.55s -> 13507.59s]  and for what they have built
[13507.59s -> 13508.39s]  and what they have done.
[13508.95s -> 13509.83s]  Do you understand?
[13510.55s -> 13512.31s]  Are you friend or are you foe?
[13520.15s -> 13520.87s]  He's a friend.
[13520.87s -> 13521.59s]  He's a friend.
[13521.59s -> 13521.99s]  He's a friend.
[13521.99s -> 13522.39s]  Let him be.
[13525.16s -> 13527.24s]  Look into the fire and tell me what your name is.
[13528.28s -> 13528.68s]  Stop.
[13528.68s -> 13529.08s]  Stop.
[13529.08s -> 13529.72s]  Stop.
[13529.72s -> 13530.52s]  Stop.
[13530.52s -> 13530.84s]  Stop.
[13533.24s -> 13534.36s]  You violated the law.
[13535.32s -> 13535.72s]  Stop.
[13535.72s -> 13536.68s]  You violated the law.
[13536.68s -> 13539.08s]  Pay the penalty or rot in prison, scum.
[13543.58s -> 13544.08s]  Stop.
[13544.86s -> 13545.36s]  Stop.
[13554.57s -> 13555.69s]  Oh, shit.
[13555.69s -> 13558.17s]  What do I do?
[13558.49s -> 13560.60s]  There's no adventurers to talk to.
[13560.60s -> 13562.36s]  There's no players to interact with.
[13563.00s -> 13566.71s]  What happens when an NPC has no-
[13566.71s -> 13567.03s]  Me.
[13567.03s -> 13567.83s]  Can you hear me?
[13568.47s -> 13568.95s]  Me.
[13568.95s -> 13570.31s]  It is me, Kongraza.
[13570.31s -> 13571.51s]  Why can I still hear you?
[13571.51s -> 13573.51s]  And why did you say your name correctly
[13573.51s -> 13575.03s]  instead of the French way?
[13575.03s -> 13578.94s]  Sorry for what you had to see.
[13578.94s -> 13579.98s]  Why can I hear you?
[13579.98s -> 13581.34s]  Just know that I will always love you.
[13581.34s -> 13585.98s]  Why can I hear you?
[13585.98s -> 13586.94s]  I'm always with you.
[13589.69s -> 13591.93s]  Mitch, you didn't get any of those hot hits on me
[13591.93s -> 13592.43s]  because you suck.
[13594.73s -> 13602.07s]  Is there anyone left?
[13605.58s -> 13606.86s]  Is there anyone left?
[13607.42s -> 13614.15s]  Please tell me there's someone left.
[13614.15s -> 13614.65s]  Someone.
[13615.27s -> 13616.79s]  A final adventurer, perhaps.
[13617.43s -> 13619.77s]  A final adventurer to talk to me
[13619.77s -> 13622.09s]  and give me one final quest before I die.
[13623.59s -> 13624.09s]  Please.
[13624.71s -> 13626.31s]  Give an old man something.
[13626.31s -> 13640.63s]  I made it.
[13640.63s -> 13650.54s]  I didn't make it.
[13650.54s -> 13653.85s]  How did I-
[13653.85s -> 13655.78s]  I didn't make it.
[13655.78s -> 13658.10s]  Don't you tell me you just died in the darkness.
[13658.10s -> 13658.74s]  I was trying-
[13658.74s -> 13660.26s]  I was hoping somebody was-
[13660.26s -> 13662.58s]  I was hoping somebody was going to show up and be like-
[13662.58s -> 13663.94s]  Because there was two people left.
[13663.94s -> 13668.78s]  I can hear you through it.
[13668.78s -> 13672.60s]  There's a lot of audio jungle.
[13675.35s -> 13677.10s]  Is it better?
[13677.10s -> 13681.56s]  Also, your mic, it might be like a webcam mic or something.
[13681.56s -> 13685.50s]  I could not understand a word that QuamCuzzler was saying.
[13685.50s -> 13686.38s]  I couldn't either.
[13687.42s -> 13688.30s]  I heard like-
[13688.30s -> 13689.10s]  I heard like-
[13689.10s -> 13691.82s]  Like something about like hot pockets in it.
[13691.82s -> 13695.14s]  You didn't say hot pockets once.
[13695.14s -> 13696.66s]  You didn't say hot pockets?
[13698.79s -> 13700.55s]  Who said they were eating a hot pocket?
[13704.84s -> 13705.64s]  Bro, I was-
[13705.64s -> 13706.14s]  I literally-
[13707.00s -> 13710.20s]  I roleplayed and I forgot that I was a girl in the game
[13710.20s -> 13711.48s]  and I just was like midway through.
[13711.48s -> 13714.36s]  I just formed a romantic relationship with you and you're-
[13714.36s -> 13716.12s]  At no point did I say hot pockets.
[13716.68s -> 13717.80s]  Your microphone was-
[13717.80s -> 13719.00s]  It was so funny because it was-
[13721.21s -> 13723.37s]  The people that we were interacting with,
[13723.37s -> 13724.49s]  I don't think I could hear what you were saying.
[13724.49s -> 13725.61s]  So you were just kind of like-
[13727.53s -> 13729.29s]  And I'm just like, adventure, please.
[13729.29s -> 13734.02s]  This RP brought you-
[13735.82s -> 13736.32s]  Wow.
[13737.18s -> 13739.10s]  Oh, I lost a good sword, I think.
[13739.10s -> 13739.66s]  Oh, whatever.
[13739.66s -> 13741.66s]  The game is over in three days.
[13741.90s -> 13743.21s]  Let me-
[13744.23s -> 13747.62s]  But at the end there, was there somebody left?
[13747.62s -> 13750.78s]  There was one person left at the very end.
[13750.78s -> 13751.28s]  Was I?
[13751.90s -> 13752.78s]  Yeah.
[13752.78s -> 13754.38s]  It said there were two.
[13755.38s -> 13757.22s]  It was like two slots.
[13757.22s -> 13761.62s]  So were people potentially just spectating me walking around?
[13761.62s -> 13764.82s]  Like having like a sad NPC ending?
[13766.10s -> 13768.62s]  Probably.
[13768.62s -> 13771.02s]  I mean, that's a great way to go out, I'd say.
[13771.02s -> 13772.22s]  I mean, that was the circle.
[13772.22s -> 13773.42s]  There was no one else there.
[13773.42s -> 13779.29s]  All right, let me know if this is better now.
[13779.29s -> 13782.34s]  Is my in-game audio better now?
[13782.34s -> 13784.01s]  I don't hear it in-game.
[13784.01s -> 13784.73s]  Oh, that's amazing.
[13784.73s -> 13785.61s]  All right, I have proposition.
[13786.73s -> 13790.34s]  But sometimes I hear Jerma through your mic.
[13791.46s -> 13796.36s]  It also looks like my thing is active, but mine isn't active.
[13799.98s -> 13803.30s]  Also, I've been trying to get an answer to this question for a while,
[13803.30s -> 13804.34s]  but I keep forgetting.
[13804.34s -> 13808.18s]  When I'm crouching and I'm trying to interact pressing F on something
[13808.18s -> 13810.34s]  to like pick up an item, it won't work.
[13810.34s -> 13814.62s]  I have to stand up to pick up an item.
[13814.62s -> 13816.22s]  I have never heard of that for anybody else.
[13818.15s -> 13818.95s]  Yeah, that's weird.
[13819.83s -> 13820.71s]  It's a little buggy, though.
[13820.71s -> 13822.71s]  Sometimes, I don't know if it's happening to you guys, too,
[13822.71s -> 13826.63s]  but sometimes I will like click to swing and nothing happens.
[13826.63s -> 13829.27s]  Yeah, there's also like an auto swing problem that people have.
[13829.27s -> 13831.35s]  There's, you know, we don't talk about them.
[13831.35s -> 13833.03s]  Okay, it's okay.
[13833.03s -> 13833.91s]  It's all right.
[13833.91s -> 13834.71s]  It happens, yeah.
[13835.51s -> 13836.95s]  It's just some strange things.
[13836.95s -> 13839.83s]  Shift makes you unable to interact sometimes, apparently.
[13839.83s -> 13840.95s]  Yeah, wait, are you?
[13840.95s -> 13845.35s]  Yeah, your crouch is bound to control, correct?
[13845.35s -> 13848.18s]  Left control?
[13848.18s -> 13848.98s]  Mine is left control.
[13848.98s -> 13849.78s]  Left shift.
[13849.78s -> 13850.34s]  Well, there you go.
[13850.34s -> 13851.30s]  Yeah, to get it off shift,
[13852.10s -> 13853.06s]  you're probably double bound.
[13856.04s -> 13857.96s]  The game's probably not recognizing
[13857.96s -> 13860.12s]  that you're double bound and not changing that for you.
[13860.12s -> 13862.04s]  My jump button is also right click,
[13862.04s -> 13865.64s]  so when I'm in the game transferring items over to my inventory,
[13865.64s -> 13867.48s]  I jump every time I transfer an item.
[13867.48s -> 13872.28s]  Sir, you've been using the like tribes ascend control scheme,
[13872.28s -> 13874.78s]  haven't you, for like the last 10 years?
[13874.78s -> 13876.94s]  Yeah, I'm a mouse to jumper.
[13876.94s -> 13882.50s]  That's actually like kind of efficient, but also what's wrong with you?
[13882.50s -> 13886.18s]  I mean, I like it, and I enjoy it,
[13886.18s -> 13889.91s]  and it doesn't work in a lot of games.
[13889.91s -> 13891.91s]  I feel like I've done mouse wheel jump,
[13891.91s -> 13893.19s]  but I've never done right click.
[13893.19s -> 13894.71s]  I mean, that's you do you, man.
[13894.71s -> 13896.84s]  All right, let's get it.
[13896.84s -> 13899.08s]  I feel like it's been an hour since we've played the video game.
[13900.44s -> 13902.33s]  All right, you guys ready?
[13902.33s -> 13904.73s]  I'm trying, but I'm mostly just sitting in this lobby
[13904.73s -> 13906.01s]  waiting for you guys to ready.
[13906.01s -> 13907.29s]  That's been my experience.
[13907.29s -> 13908.49s]  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
[13908.49s -> 13910.01s]  No, you need to hurry up.
[13910.01s -> 13912.92s]  Get your ass in the game.
[13912.92s -> 13913.64s]  All right, first of all.
[13913.64s -> 13914.04s]  This is the one.
[13915.02s -> 13917.98s]  Most of this has been me getting here for you guys.
[13917.98s -> 13919.82s]  Hello, friend.
[13919.82s -> 13920.14s]  Hello.
[13920.14s -> 13920.46s]  Hello.
[13920.46s -> 13921.74s]  Can you hear me?
[13921.74s -> 13923.85s]  Is my audio?
[13923.85s -> 13924.25s]  Never.
[13924.25s -> 13925.21s]  That's never enough.
[13925.21s -> 13926.65s]  I just turned off in game.
[13926.65s -> 13927.61s]  It was being really weird,
[13927.61s -> 13929.77s]  and I kept hearing Jerma talk through like your mic.
[13929.77s -> 13932.15s]  That's very strange.
[13932.15s -> 13933.11s]  I thought I just turned it off, too.
[13933.11s -> 13933.67s]  That's weird.
[13933.67s -> 13938.12s]  Yeah, I know.
[13938.12s -> 13938.84s]  I can't hear anything.
[13942.14s -> 13943.82s]  All right, yours are actually bleeding.
[13943.82s -> 13944.70s]  Gamer time.
[13944.70s -> 13946.78s]  Wait, does that give you that little notification
[13946.78s -> 13949.06s]  that I'm muting and unmuting?
[13949.06s -> 13950.02s]  Oh, okay, good.
[13950.02s -> 13952.26s]  I thought when you said bleeding, I muted and unmuted.
[13952.26s -> 13955.08s]  Rapier for you, Sir DiPy.
[13955.08s -> 13956.60s]  So you have a melee in between.
[13956.60s -> 13957.64s]  Otherwise, it's really annoying.
[13957.64s -> 13958.60s]  Also, take this.
[13958.60s -> 13959.00s]  It is.
[13960.36s -> 13960.76s]  I know.
[13960.76s -> 13962.10s]  I played Ranger.
[13962.10s -> 13964.02s]  I took your battle axe as well.
[13964.02s -> 13964.66s]  Yep.
[13964.66s -> 13966.34s]  I don't know if you can use that, but have fun.
[13966.34s -> 13968.18s]  I murdered your toys this way.
[13968.18s -> 13969.06s]  Oh, thanks for the shoes,
[13969.06s -> 13970.90s]  because my feet really were getting super dirty
[13970.90s -> 13972.89s]  walking around down here.
[13972.89s -> 13975.69s]  I want to keep those dogs clean.
[13975.69s -> 13976.09s]  All right.
[13976.09s -> 13977.82s]  This is loud, too.
[13987.70s -> 13994.79s]  I'm going to shoot.
[13994.79s -> 13995.43s]  That hit you.
[13996.07s -> 13997.27s]  What is?
[13997.27s -> 13997.83s]  Oh, my God.
[13997.83s -> 13998.31s]  What's happening?
[13998.31s -> 13999.91s]  What the fuck is going on here?
[13999.91s -> 14001.69s]  The Rangers are nuts.
[14001.69s -> 14002.09s]  No, no, no.
[14002.09s -> 14004.49s]  I thought that was you behind me.
[14004.49s -> 14005.53s]  That was weird.
[14005.53s -> 14006.03s]  Ow.
[14007.61s -> 14009.05s]  Do you want me to be behind you?
[14009.05s -> 14010.26s]  I can get there.
[14010.26s -> 14011.46s]  Oh, Jesus.
[14011.46s -> 14012.10s]  Be careful.
[14012.10s -> 14014.81s]  I thought you were behind me.
[14014.81s -> 14016.57s]  No, I was told to be in front,
[14016.57s -> 14018.68s]  which I'm probably going to get shot in the back of the head,
[14018.68s -> 14019.40s]  but I'm ready for it.
[14019.40s -> 14020.49s]  I am.
[14020.49s -> 14021.69s]  I'm a gamer.
[14021.69s -> 14022.81s]  I won't do that.
[14022.81s -> 14026.01s]  I can tell from the right click mouse button jump thing,
[14026.01s -> 14026.49s]  whatever that is.
[14026.49s -> 14032.95s]  Yeah, that was what truly identifies me as a gamer.
[14032.95s -> 14034.44s]  Nice.
[14034.44s -> 14035.24s]  He's gaming.
[14035.24s -> 14035.96s]  This bat's in here.
[14035.96s -> 14037.32s]  Why are the lights off?
[14037.32s -> 14038.76s]  Why are the lights off?
[14038.76s -> 14039.72s]  Explain this to me.
[14039.72s -> 14040.76s]  I have a shitty room.
[14040.76s -> 14041.88s]  Interact speed.
[14041.88s -> 14042.52s]  All right, all right.
[14042.52s -> 14044.60s]  This room is rough because there's a wraith here
[14044.60s -> 14047.40s]  and I have a shitty weapon for this.
[14047.40s -> 14048.92s]  So we're going to turn around.
[14048.92s -> 14050.12s]  Executive decision, I'm sorry.
[14050.12s -> 14052.44s]  No, that room is actually a hell.
[14052.44s -> 14053.16s]  Worth it.
[14053.16s -> 14053.64s]  Yeah.
[14053.64s -> 14056.30s]  Like, if you have a cleric, it's fine.
[14056.30s -> 14060.60s]  But oh, fun thing, if you guys want to try it,
[14060.60s -> 14062.44s]  you can do a brewmaster cleric
[14062.44s -> 14063.96s]  and you can drink beer to give you
[14063.96s -> 14066.52s]  plus like 11 strength for 15 seconds.
[14066.52s -> 14068.52s]  And you can literally just bite you with your fist
[14068.52s -> 14069.64s]  and actually down them.
[14069.64s -> 14071.69s]  You don't get drunk from it, right?
[14071.69s -> 14072.41s]  Yep.
[14072.41s -> 14075.59s]  It's a lot of fun.
[14075.59s -> 14078.49s]  All right, I got friends up here.
[14078.49s -> 14079.29s]  Let's go.
[14079.29s -> 14092.90s]  Oh, nice doc.
[14094.50s -> 14095.88s]  Thanks, dude.
[14095.88s -> 14097.96s]  Oh, hey, man, there's some sick loot on there for you.
[14097.96s -> 14098.52s]  There it was.
[14098.52s -> 14100.94s]  It was a lot of money.
[14100.94s -> 14101.18s]  Oh, great work.
[14101.18s -> 14103.34s]  I have a buckler over here if you want.
[14103.34s -> 14104.30s]  If you're into that sort of thing.
[14105.66s -> 14108.95s]  What's the difference between longbow shortbow?
[14108.95s -> 14111.03s]  Any significant thing I should be aware of?
[14112.39s -> 14114.71s]  So the recurve bow, I know you can fire faster.
[14114.71s -> 14115.91s]  How many arrows do you have on the recurve?
[14115.91s -> 14118.62s]  Is it six or five or six?
[14118.62s -> 14120.06s]  Yeah, so I think a longbow, you get five,
[14120.06s -> 14122.62s]  but it's like 40 damage, usually 30 to 40 damage.
[14123.50s -> 14125.42s]  It do be looking like a lot of damage.
[14125.42s -> 14128.54s]  Stirrer, you're going to want this on the ground right now.
[14128.54s -> 14132.25s]  That's an unbelievably good bow.
[14132.25s -> 14133.13s]  Is it a survival bow?
[14133.13s -> 14134.01s]  Please don't be a survival bow.
[14134.01s -> 14134.57s]  It's a blue.
[14135.64s -> 14136.20s]  Where?
[14136.20s -> 14137.64s]  Yeah, but if it's a blue survival bow,
[14137.64s -> 14138.84s]  it's just actually to tease.
[14138.84s -> 14140.39s]  Put it on the ground?
[14140.39s -> 14141.11s]  Oh, no.
[14141.83s -> 14143.59s]  Oh, boys, this might be one of the...
[14143.59s -> 14145.72s]  Wait, hopefully it's in the...
[14145.72s -> 14146.52s]  Oh, no.
[14146.52s -> 14147.78s]  What happened?
[14147.78s -> 14149.38s]  It might be in the texture.
[14149.38s -> 14151.46s]  See how there's the actual barrier.
[14151.46s -> 14152.34s]  I got it, I got it, I got it.
[14152.34s -> 14153.38s]  Oh, thank God.
[14153.38s -> 14153.86s]  I got it.
[14153.86s -> 14155.46s]  Yeah, there's a little piece sticking out.
[14155.46s -> 14156.60s]  There you go.
[14156.60s -> 14157.72s]  Oh, this is perfect.
[14157.72s -> 14159.64s]  Oh, bless the heavens.
[14159.64s -> 14160.76s]  We're gaming again.
[14160.76s -> 14163.08s]  I think it should be really good.
[14163.08s -> 14164.44s]  That's more damage than the longbow.
[14164.44s -> 14164.92s]  Yeah.
[14164.92s -> 14169.18s]  I think some bows have different amount of arrows too, right?
[14169.18s -> 14169.74s]  Yeah, yeah.
[14170.46s -> 14173.50s]  So anyways, longbow can obviously shoot longer.
[14173.50s -> 14176.46s]  It's a bigger bow and then that'll shoot quicker.
[14176.46s -> 14177.42s]  Recurves are really good.
[14177.42s -> 14178.78s]  This is just the same shitty room.
[14178.78s -> 14180.14s]  Yeah, this is literally the same room.
[14180.14s -> 14181.18s]  We can run through it.
[14181.18s -> 14181.98s]  It's just...
[14181.98s -> 14183.82s]  I have my fear up.
[14183.82s -> 14186.30s]  It's just risky-ish, but...
[14186.30s -> 14188.14s]  I mean, we don't really have...
[14188.14s -> 14189.50s]  We'd have to run all the way around.
[14189.50s -> 14191.22s]  Yeah, we can do this.
[14191.22s -> 14192.18s]  We're gamers.
[14192.18s -> 14194.87s]  Yeah, you can shoot through that hole if you're space back.
[14194.87s -> 14196.47s]  Like, you can shoot them if you step back.
[14196.47s -> 14198.71s]  Beautiful.
[14198.71s -> 14199.35s]  Oh, you can.
[14199.35s -> 14200.31s]  Excellent technique.
[14200.31s -> 14201.13s]  Yep.
[14201.13s -> 14202.49s]  Yeah, I mean, you can also use...
[14202.49s -> 14204.01s]  It's not high enough to shoot.
[14204.01s -> 14206.84s]  Here, let me turn this off for you.
[14206.84s -> 14208.57s]  Oh, so much better.
[14208.57s -> 14209.69s]  I was worried.
[14209.69s -> 14213.58s]  All right, boys, just run with me, please.
[14213.58s -> 14217.56s]  This way.
[14217.56s -> 14219.74s]  Doesn't mean shoot.
[14219.74s -> 14220.54s]  Ow!
[14220.54s -> 14222.30s]  He's aggroing enemies on purpose.
[14222.30s -> 14223.50s]  He's griefing us.
[14223.50s -> 14224.70s]  Does it matter if I shoot him?
[14224.70s -> 14225.82s]  No, I'm kidding.
[14225.82s -> 14226.62s]  I'm kidding.
[14226.62s -> 14228.57s]  It was all in jest, my friend.
[14228.57s -> 14230.58s]  I didn't like that joke.
[14230.58s -> 14234.42s]  That joke was hurtful.
[14234.42s -> 14235.14s]  Good.
[14235.14s -> 14236.81s]  It means it was funny.
[14236.81s -> 14242.12s]  This is supposed to be a gamer run, not an argument run.
[14242.12s -> 14243.40s]  We've had plenty of those.
[14243.40s -> 14244.28s]  Please, guys.
[14245.48s -> 14246.92s]  Now, I'm going to eat my snack.
[14249.02s -> 14252.95s]  Oh, this guy was shot with arrows.
[14252.95s -> 14253.83s]  Boys, look at this.
[14253.83s -> 14254.55s]  Look at this.
[14254.55s -> 14257.51s]  We're going to do our Witcher 3 Geralt of Orivia inspection.
[14258.73s -> 14260.09s]  Arrows to the body.
[14260.09s -> 14261.30s]  Somebody shot him.
[14261.30s -> 14262.18s]  That's all I got for you.
[14262.18s -> 14263.14s]  Those were my arrows.
[14264.04s -> 14265.24s]  Geralt, those were my arrows.
[14265.24s -> 14265.80s]  I was trying.
[14265.80s -> 14268.28s]  I thought he was on the ground pretending to be dead.
[14268.28s -> 14269.67s]  So I was doing it.
[14270.55s -> 14271.67s]  I'm a little upset.
[14271.67s -> 14273.32s]  My Witcher senses have failed me.
[14279.16s -> 14279.64s]  Don't move.
[14279.64s -> 14280.68s]  Don't you move a shoe.
[14280.68s -> 14281.98s]  Don't move.
[14281.98s -> 14282.62s]  Listening.
[14282.62s -> 14284.04s]  All right, we're good.
[14284.04s -> 14284.36s]  Follow me.
[14284.36s -> 14284.84s]  Spiders.
[14284.84s -> 14286.04s]  There's a lever right here.
[14286.04s -> 14290.98s]  Let's get in this room.
[14290.98s -> 14292.98s]  Oh, that's where those spiders are.
[14295.86s -> 14296.26s]  I'm coming.
[14296.26s -> 14296.82s]  I'm coming.
[14296.82s -> 14298.28s]  All right, we got to go.
[14298.28s -> 14299.72s]  We got to get circling south.
[14299.72s -> 14301.54s]  Speed.
[14301.54s -> 14302.50s]  Oh, my goodness.
[14303.70s -> 14305.22s]  I don't know what this means, but this is cool looking.
[14307.00s -> 14307.32s]  Stir.
[14307.32s -> 14308.84s]  If only we had a lockpick.
[14308.84s -> 14310.18s]  Oh, fuck.
[14310.18s -> 14312.76s]  I'm going to start being a lockpick guy.
[14312.76s -> 14313.48s]  Oh, my God.
[14314.98s -> 14315.94s]  I've never seen one of these.
[14317.62s -> 14320.02s]  We're about to get cuddled by the circle if we don't get out of here.
[14320.02s -> 14320.34s]  Shit.
[14320.34s -> 14321.78s]  Let's go.
[14321.78s -> 14322.58s]  Let's go, dude.
[14323.38s -> 14324.26s]  I wonder what's in there.
[14324.26s -> 14324.90s]  I'm out.
[14324.90s -> 14325.22s]  Bye-bye.
[14328.71s -> 14329.51s]  Bye-bye.
[14329.51s -> 14333.69s]  It's probably all kinds of jewels and gems.
[14341.72s -> 14342.92s]  I want to be just a green.
[14342.92s -> 14343.72s]  Yeah, that's possible.
[14343.72s -> 14344.68s]  Friends.
[14344.68s -> 14346.04s]  Hello, friends.
[14346.04s -> 14346.62s]  Hello.
[14346.62s -> 14347.74s]  This is a gamer run.
[14347.74s -> 14348.70s]  This is a gamer run.
[14348.70s -> 14349.26s]  We play.
[14349.26s -> 14349.74s]  I know.
[14349.74s -> 14350.62s]  I was going to.
[14350.62s -> 14351.42s]  It was metagaming.
[14351.42s -> 14351.98s]  OK.
[14351.98s -> 14353.46s]  Hold on.
[14353.46s -> 14354.82s]  I'm in the secret passage.
[14354.82s -> 14356.10s]  I was going for a deception check.
[14364.57s -> 14365.77s]  This old castle.
[14365.77s -> 14367.13s]  Just want to make sure everyone's aware.
[14367.13s -> 14369.75s]  I just killed them both.
[14369.75s -> 14370.47s]  You monster.
[14370.47s -> 14370.87s]  I love it.
[14371.75s -> 14372.87s]  Look what you become.
[14372.87s -> 14374.89s]  I'll take credit for that.
[14374.89s -> 14375.53s]  Thank you.
[14375.53s -> 14375.93s]  My goodness.
[14375.93s -> 14376.41s]  They love us.
[14379.70s -> 14380.82s]  Ooh, is that better?
[14380.82s -> 14381.56s]  28.
[14381.56s -> 14382.04s]  Yeah.
[14382.04s -> 14384.34s]  I'm in space.
[14384.90s -> 14387.62s]  Oh, here.
[14387.62s -> 14388.82s]  Take this trap if you want.
[14388.82s -> 14389.62s]  Because you're a ranger now.
[14389.62s -> 14394.63s]  You can use those.
[14394.63s -> 14395.19s]  Oh, my God.
[14395.19s -> 14397.03s]  Throwing axes are so good.
[14397.03s -> 14400.41s]  Do you mind if I take this potion, my friend?
[14402.57s -> 14403.77s]  No, please do it.
[14403.77s -> 14404.81s]  Oh, thank you.
[14404.81s -> 14405.93s]  So so coined.
[14405.93s -> 14407.96s]  Do you want these throwing axes?
[14407.96s -> 14409.96s]  Oh, dude, I yes.
[14409.96s -> 14412.54s]  Because I have like a shitload of them.
[14412.54s -> 14414.22s]  I love these things.
[14414.22s -> 14415.66s]  I also love the oil lanterns.
[14415.66s -> 14416.55s]  Thank you.
[14416.55s -> 14419.42s]  Oh, God bless.
[14419.42s -> 14420.70s]  They're 30 damage a pop.
[14420.70s -> 14423.86s]  But they're just actually not an exit.
[14423.94s -> 14424.66s]  There is an exit.
[14431.00s -> 14432.76s]  Boys, I have a feeling there's...
[14433.48s -> 14434.52s]  Wait, hold on.
[14434.52s -> 14435.80s]  Let me just kill feed.
[14435.80s -> 14437.32s]  Oh, there's friends ahead, friends ahead.
[14437.32s -> 14437.72s]  All right.
[14437.72s -> 14439.42s]  This is a gamer run, remember?
[14439.42s -> 14448.38s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14448.38s -> 14449.10s]  Stop.
[14449.10s -> 14450.54s]  In the name of the law.
[14450.54s -> 14455.29s]  This is a gamer run.
[14455.29s -> 14458.52s]  I'm just going to leave.
[14460.98s -> 14462.50s]  They ran.
[14462.50s -> 14462.98s]  Oh, yeah.
[14462.98s -> 14464.57s]  Oh, yeah.
[14464.57s -> 14465.85s]  They're certified runners.
[14465.85s -> 14466.33s]  Oh, my God.
[14466.33s -> 14466.97s]  They're so dead.
[14466.97s -> 14468.09s]  They're so dead.
[14468.09s -> 14468.41s]  Stop.
[14468.41s -> 14469.53s]  This is a gamer run.
[14469.53s -> 14470.41s]  They're like, OK.
[14472.23s -> 14477.18s]  And what does that mean?
[14477.18s -> 14478.14s]  Watch me throwing axe skills.
[14478.14s -> 14478.54s]  Watch this.
[14479.34s -> 14480.60s]  Is this gas?
[14482.90s -> 14483.38s]  Hail Mary.
[14483.38s -> 14483.86s]  Hail Mary.
[14484.42s -> 14485.22s]  Oh, so close.
[14491.16s -> 14492.36s]  There's a lot of shit in there.
[14492.36s -> 14493.32s]  I don't know if we fight in here.
[14494.95s -> 14495.43s]  It's fine.
[14495.43s -> 14496.07s]  You'll be all right.
[14496.07s -> 14497.27s]  There's a lot of people in here.
[14497.91s -> 14499.37s]  What the heck?
[14499.37s -> 14501.37s]  Ster, where are you?
[14501.37s -> 14502.82s]  Wait, you left.
[14502.82s -> 14504.28s]  Oh, Sterg left.
[14504.28s -> 14505.16s]  I went home.
[14505.16s -> 14505.80s]  Oh, shit.
[14505.80s -> 14506.68s]  I mean, he was gaming.
[14506.68s -> 14507.24s]  He was gaming.
[14507.24s -> 14507.80s]  Yeah, you were.
[14509.64s -> 14511.00s]  You guys ran off.
[14511.00s -> 14513.32s]  I was looting like a secret room.
[14513.32s -> 14514.84s]  And then you guys just kept going.
[14514.84s -> 14515.80s]  I'm out of here.
[14515.80s -> 14516.28s]  I'm sorry.
[14516.28s -> 14517.08s]  You're on your own.
[14517.08s -> 14517.80s]  No, you're good.
[14517.80s -> 14520.62s]  I'm medicated.
[14520.62s -> 14529.37s]  Oh, he put the worms on you.
[14529.37s -> 14530.09s]  Yeah, I'm out of here.
[14530.09s -> 14543.22s]  I have a lot of stuff.
[14543.22s -> 14544.66s]  Oh, yes.
[14544.66s -> 14545.30s]  OK, goodbye.
[14549.26s -> 14550.46s]  Oh, bastard.
[14552.28s -> 14553.96s]  You're in a predicament down here.
[14555.46s -> 14555.94s]  Was that?
[14558.47s -> 14561.83s]  Yeah, there was so many things in that room.
[14561.83s -> 14563.75s]  I kind of abandoned you, but I'm sorry.
[14563.75s -> 14564.39s]  But I did.
[14564.39s -> 14565.03s]  You're fine.
[14565.03s -> 14567.35s]  Gamers gamers don't have feelings.
[14568.55s -> 14569.27s]  I'm actually offended.
[14569.27s -> 14570.47s]  You're apologizing right now.
[14570.92s -> 14575.32s]  Well, in that case, um, you.
[14576.44s -> 14576.84s]  Yeah.
[14576.84s -> 14577.32s]  Well, thank you.
[14577.32s -> 14578.28s]  Now I feel better.
[14578.28s -> 14581.03s]  I think you are.
[14581.03s -> 14582.47s]  Are you going for a battle here?
[14582.47s -> 14584.39s]  Because you got a lot of potential.
[14584.39s -> 14585.35s]  I think there's somebody in that room.
[14586.07s -> 14588.52s]  Well, they have to come to me.
[14589.08s -> 14590.52s]  That's the beautiful thing about this run.
[14597.98s -> 14599.98s]  I was drinking out of drinking of water
[14600.94s -> 14603.18s]  and I just like scared the shit out of me.
[14605.78s -> 14606.98s]  Trevor, there's someone in your room.
[14608.10s -> 14608.58s]  Get out.
[14613.19s -> 14614.55s]  If they're dumb, they're going to come through.
[14614.55s -> 14615.35s]  I really hope they do.
[14616.07s -> 14617.51s]  Well, what if they just run right in?
[14618.15s -> 14619.53s]  Well, if they go around, at least
[14619.53s -> 14620.97s]  and then I get the swing on them first.
[14621.77s -> 14625.53s]  This is what gaming looks like, boys.
[14626.25s -> 14627.90s]  Ah, too bad.
[14629.42s -> 14633.16s]  I was kind of hoping somebody was just going to run in.
[14634.84s -> 14637.58s]  Okay, cool.
[14637.58s -> 14639.02s]  That should be a lot of money.
[14639.02s -> 14645.50s]  Do you instantly sell or you just put it in your stash?
[14646.14s -> 14647.74s]  Uh, I sell pretty much everything
[14647.74s -> 14649.10s]  unless it's something that's valuable.
[14649.66s -> 14651.21s]  Yeah, I'm afraid to.
[14651.21s -> 14653.21s]  I might get yelled at, so I'm already ready.
[14653.21s -> 14656.20s]  Uh, yeah, I'm going to start yelling in a second.
[14656.20s -> 14660.81s]  Just take the second.
[14660.81s -> 14662.86s]  Hold on.
[14662.86s -> 14663.66s]  Oh my God, this guy.
[14664.30s -> 14665.10s]  It just takes a second.
[14665.82s -> 14666.86s]  Mm hmm. Sure it does.
[14667.42s -> 14675.34s]  Look at that.
[14675.34s -> 14676.06s]  I'm going to fill the whole thing up.
[14676.06s -> 14677.66s]  I got an oil lamp.
[14677.66s -> 14679.48s]  Is that irrelevant?
[14679.48s -> 14681.32s]  So it's basically just a molly.
[14681.32s -> 14683.24s]  You right click and you throw it like a molly.
[14683.24s -> 14685.24s]  Oh, I assumed it was like a.
[14685.24s -> 14686.87s]  It actually is a light source.
[14686.87s -> 14689.67s]  So if you if you left click, it's a light source.
[14689.67s -> 14690.55s]  Do you know what I want to do?
[14691.75s -> 14692.87s]  I'm going to be such a.
[14692.87s -> 14694.55s]  I'm going to be such a fucking weirdo.
[14694.55s -> 14696.89s]  But like the last day of the beta,
[14696.89s -> 14701.56s]  I'm going to fill my entire inventory with 10 gold stacks
[14701.64s -> 14704.68s]  and just and just be a loot goblin and just die for somebody.
[14704.68s -> 14707.80s]  And they'll they're going to look at me and take my gear and go.
[14710.54s -> 14711.10s]  You know what I mean?
[14711.10s -> 14713.02s]  Really fill every single slot.
[14713.02s -> 14714.70s]  What are you, Mr. Beast?
[14714.70s -> 14715.18s]  Like what?
[14719.21s -> 14719.69s]  Like what?
[14719.69s -> 14721.61s]  Like to make somebody's day for no reason?
[14721.61s -> 14722.57s]  Yeah, like, I don't know.
[14723.13s -> 14724.25s]  Because if that happened.
[14724.25s -> 14725.13s]  I hate that.
[14725.13s -> 14725.93s]  Why?
[14725.93s -> 14728.18s]  I'd rather have worms.
[14728.18s -> 14730.34s]  Why it's OK.
[14730.34s -> 14732.26s]  If I were to if you killed.
[14732.26s -> 14732.50s]  All right.
[14732.50s -> 14734.82s]  If you killed somebody with an axe in this game.
[14735.14s -> 14738.74s]  And you looted them and their whole inventory was a stack of gold.
[14738.74s -> 14742.33s]  You don't think you would chuckle and be like, what the fuck are you doing, man?
[14742.33s -> 14744.81s]  I thought you were going to like run around and like leave a trail.
[14746.68s -> 14747.96s]  That'd be even better.
[14747.96s -> 14754.28s]  Yeah, like when I get hit, like drop five and keep running.
[14754.28s -> 14758.76s]  Yeah, just fill my inventory with potions and like surgical kits
[14758.76s -> 14762.58s]  and just run around and every time I get hit, just drop five stacks and just keep going.
[14762.58s -> 14764.26s]  I mean, you play Borderlands, right?
[14764.26s -> 14765.50s]  A little bit, yeah.
[14765.50s -> 14768.06s]  Like there's the loot goblins that like you shoot and they just drop.
[14769.70s -> 14771.86s]  They just drop gear as you shoot that pretty much.
[14771.86s -> 14772.26s]  Sonic.
[14772.26s -> 14772.82s]  Same concept.
[14779.91s -> 14780.71s]  What in the world?
[14780.71s -> 14783.19s]  It was actually pretty good singing.
[14783.19s -> 14783.83s]  That's pretty good.
[14787.77s -> 14788.89s]  All right, guys, stick together.
[14788.89s -> 14790.01s]  Keep your wits about you.
[14790.01s -> 14793.54s]  We all might make it out alive.
[14793.54s -> 14794.58s]  I mean, we split up.
[14794.58s -> 14799.22s]  We still made it because we're committing to being video game players now.
[14799.22s -> 14805.34s]  You guys walk through like four rooms of unopened chests that was just opening boxes.
[14805.34s -> 14808.06s]  And then I turned to look where you were and you were like the other side of the map.
[14808.06s -> 14808.94s]  I was like, OK, bye.
[14809.74s -> 14812.70s]  Well, I prioritize getting kills, getting frags.
[14812.70s -> 14814.14s]  You know, I don't need that.
[14814.14s -> 14815.98s]  You know, getting money is for plebs at this point.
[14815.98s -> 14817.10s]  I'm I'm already rich.
[14817.10s -> 14821.34s]  Well, unless you want to do your money loot goblin video that I'm doing.
[14821.98s -> 14823.08s]  True.
[14823.08s -> 14823.64s]  That's that's it.
[14823.64s -> 14824.28s]  Did you get hit by that?
[14827.06s -> 14830.34s]  Oh, boys, I got I got boys on me looking for a fight already.
[14831.70s -> 14832.10s]  Yeah.
[14832.10s -> 14836.02s]  I mean, in theory, we want to let them live a little longer so we can loot them later.
[14836.02s -> 14836.26s]  Yeah.
[14836.34s -> 14838.54s]  But I like killing them now.
[14838.54s -> 14844.34s]  Kind of kind of a wild one.
[14844.34s -> 14845.46s]  Oh, he made the jump.
[14845.46s -> 14846.26s]  He's kind of nuts.
[14846.90s -> 14847.86s]  That's crazy.
[14847.86s -> 14848.58s]  Don't mess with that guy.
[14848.58s -> 14849.06s]  He's good.
[14852.47s -> 14853.27s]  What the fuck?
[14853.27s -> 14855.43s]  Oh, I killed one.
[14855.43s -> 14855.75s]  Yeah.
[14855.75s -> 14856.31s]  Beautiful.
[14856.31s -> 14857.35s]  Well done, sir.
[14857.35s -> 14857.91s]  Yeah, same.
[14859.83s -> 14860.63s]  Where are you, sir?
[14860.63s -> 14861.51s]  I don't.
[14861.51s -> 14862.55s]  Where did you guys go?
[14862.55s -> 14864.33s]  You're dead.
[14864.33s -> 14868.33s]  I was in the starting room killing the enemies that were around and picking things up.
[14868.33s -> 14871.82s]  Should I stop picking things up and playing the core loop of the game?
[14871.82s -> 14872.70s]  Are we done with that?
[14872.70s -> 14874.86s]  No, he just saw he had bloodlust.
[14874.86s -> 14877.05s]  He just ran after a bunch of people.
[14877.05s -> 14877.77s]  OK, I don't know.
[14877.77s -> 14878.65s]  A guy landed on me.
[14878.65s -> 14879.29s]  I'm dead.
[14879.29s -> 14884.60s]  The guy made no footsteps and just appeared on me and then I died.
[14884.60s -> 14892.44s]  So I got to fuck this guy up real quick.
[14892.44s -> 14893.24s]  Please hold.
[14893.24s -> 14894.28s]  Oh, wait, you're alive.
[14894.28s -> 14895.00s]  I thought they killed you.
[14895.00s -> 14895.64s]  Oh, yeah.
[14895.64s -> 14896.44s]  No, no, I'm not.
[14896.44s -> 14898.20s]  I'm realizing who I'm watching right now.
[14898.20s -> 14900.33s]  So you just left me to die.
[14906.34s -> 14907.38s]  OK, these traps suck.
[14907.38s -> 14907.86s]  Holy shit.
[14913.88s -> 14914.12s]  All right.
[14914.12s -> 14915.64s]  I just OK, that was weird.
[14915.64s -> 14922.15s]  Gamer versus gamer.
[14922.15s -> 14926.71s]  If you smarty won't go through.
[14936.71s -> 14937.83s]  I almost got his head.
[14938.47s -> 14940.34s]  That's close.
[14940.34s -> 14943.38s]  But anyways, you know, I usually go for player kills immediately
[14943.38s -> 14945.86s]  because you obviously, if you kill them, you get the best loot
[14945.86s -> 14947.30s]  because they come in kidded most of the times.
[14947.86s -> 14950.74s]  So if you can just get a good kill on them as a barb, you get the loot,
[14950.74s -> 14952.25s]  which means we all got loot.
[14952.25s -> 14953.61s]  Does that make sense?
[14953.61s -> 14954.79s]  Yeah.
[14954.79s -> 14956.47s]  Well, you also level up.
[14956.47s -> 14957.99s]  You level quick too, right?
[14957.99s -> 14960.47s]  If you kill a player, it's not worth a lot.
[14960.47s -> 14967.59s]  Yeah, 100%.
[14967.59s -> 14973.66s]  We have like our three actual classes that we have been accidentally RPing as the whole time.
[14973.66s -> 14976.94s]  You're like the bloodlust barbarian and that's what you're doing.
[14977.42s -> 14981.66s]  Stir is like the tinkerer that wants to collect the loot and the toys.
[14981.66s -> 14983.26s]  I thought you were playing the game.
[14983.26s -> 14986.54s]  And I'm like the I'm like the fucking stand up comedian
[14986.54s -> 14990.23s]  that just walks around and yells at people and dies.
[14990.23s -> 14991.59s]  Yeah, I mean, make no mistake about it.
[14991.59s -> 14992.71s]  I'm actually a troglodyte.
[14992.71s -> 14995.43s]  Stir wants to live more than two minutes.
[14995.43s -> 14998.47s]  The bard, the jester, you're the loot goblin.
[15001.51s -> 15003.19s]  What class is the stand?
[15003.19s -> 15005.59s]  Oh, yeah, you're the you're the you're the barbarian.
[15005.59s -> 15009.62s]  You are the tinkerer thief and I'm the stand up comedian.
[15009.62s -> 15011.30s]  They need to add instruments to this game.
[15011.38s -> 15015.54s]  I think they're I think the conversation was adding bards and either
[15016.26s -> 15018.58s]  warlocks or necromancers to the game.
[15018.58s -> 15022.36s]  Did they actually have plans on adding more classes?
[15022.36s -> 15024.52s]  Yeah, no, I mean, they have they have completely
[15025.93s -> 15029.77s]  been transparent on this is Dungeons and Dragons multiplayer.
[15029.77s -> 15031.58s]  Really?
[15031.58s -> 15036.04s]  Which is going to be interesting with the new Wizards of the Coast decisions.
[15037.80s -> 15040.36s]  Well, I look any content is cool.
[15040.36s -> 15043.32s]  I mean, I think the game is pretty close to this right now.
[15043.32s -> 15045.34s]  Yeah, 100%.
[15049.05s -> 15051.37s]  Yeah, the game is just the demo is free.
[15051.37s -> 15052.81s]  Some people have been asking about it.
[15052.81s -> 15057.56s]  You can just play it right now during the Steam demo week, whatever.
[15057.56s -> 15060.92s]  Yeah, I had a wild thought and maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but hear me out.
[15060.92s -> 15064.12s]  Imagine this game with a forge system like Halo Forge,
[15064.12s -> 15069.74s]  where they make the dungeons and you have to traverse player made dungeons.
[15069.74s -> 15071.35s]  Interesting.
[15071.35s -> 15073.72s]  Like a Mario maker thing.
[15073.72s -> 15075.88s]  It's like just these nuts dungeons.
[15075.88s -> 15077.48s]  I'd love more PvE.
[15077.48s -> 15079.72s]  PvE I think in this game could be really, really awesome.
[15081.05s -> 15082.57s]  Yeah, any more PvE would be great.
[15084.68s -> 15087.56s]  Because it doesn't spoon feed you in terms of combat.
[15087.56s -> 15090.65s]  It's more like it's more like a fuck you.
[15090.65s -> 15092.30s]  Good luck.
[15092.30s -> 15093.90s]  Yeah, let's see what they do.
[15093.90s -> 15099.10s]  I mean, it's been pretty fun so far, so.
[15099.10s -> 15100.42s]  Yes.
[15100.42s -> 15101.77s]  All right, Fearing.
[15101.77s -> 15105.69s]  I think the Elder Scrolls does that, the PvE part.
[15113.59s -> 15115.99s]  There are so fucking many of these things.
[15116.55s -> 15119.19s]  Yeah, make sure you loot every single one of these when you kill them.
[15119.19s -> 15120.07s]  Nice job, by the way.
[15120.07s -> 15121.58s]  This guy's a game.
[15121.58s -> 15124.86s]  Fuck.
[15124.86s -> 15125.36s]  Game.
[15127.22s -> 15128.42s]  Oh, lockpick here.
[15128.42s -> 15129.94s]  Here, you have the highest resource for this.
[15129.94s -> 15131.54s]  I think your lockpick chances are better.
[15131.54s -> 15136.10s]  Oh, wait, don't don't drop any items on the pyramid that can get stuck in the textures,
[15136.10s -> 15137.90s]  the elevated textures.
[15138.62s -> 15140.10s]  Yeah.
[15140.10s -> 15143.70s]  Yeah, like how that like how that short bow we couldn't remember.
[15143.70s -> 15146.18s]  Anyways, look at this little flashlight.
[15146.18s -> 15146.98s]  Oh, this one was red.
[15148.42s -> 15153.54s]  Yep, the red ones are like the they're the elite version of the death skulls.
[15155.29s -> 15156.57s]  But here, take I'm going to drop.
[15156.57s -> 15159.69s]  I'm going to put this on the body of something and you can use that to on the
[15160.41s -> 15161.53s]  the chest up here.
[15163.67s -> 15164.95s]  Mr. Ranger man.
[15164.95s -> 15168.26s]  I'll put it in here.
[15168.34s -> 15168.66s]  Oh, wait.
[15168.66s -> 15169.30s]  Well, I'm sorry.
[15169.30s -> 15171.54s]  I'm so locked in chest.
[15173.30s -> 15174.18s]  You smarter than me.
[15175.94s -> 15177.06s]  I take lockpick.
[15177.06s -> 15178.66s]  I go take lockpick lock.
[15178.66s -> 15181.58s]  You use, you know, minigame of lockpick.
[15181.58s -> 15183.10s]  It's very quick, by the way.
[15183.10s -> 15184.06s]  It's not like slow.
[15184.70s -> 15188.09s]  OK, well, if your character's dumb, it's harder.
[15188.09s -> 15193.03s]  I that was like a jump scare and I was supposed to click.
[15193.03s -> 15196.47s]  It's very I couldn't even warn you because me saying it was fast.
[15196.47s -> 15197.59s]  It's like, OK, how fast?
[15197.59s -> 15199.27s]  And it's it's unbelievably fast.
[15199.27s -> 15200.57s]  So yeah.
[15200.57s -> 15204.09s]  I mean, you like the human benchmark test fast.
[15204.09s -> 15205.98s]  And what button does it?
[15205.98s -> 15207.34s]  It's left click.
[15207.34s -> 15208.54s]  It's really annoying.
[15208.54s -> 15209.34s]  OK, I thought so.
[15209.34s -> 15211.42s]  My chat was telling me random buttons.
[15211.98s -> 15212.62s]  Well, good.
[15212.62s -> 15215.10s]  I mean, well, you do have weird vines potentially.
[15215.10s -> 15219.16s]  Your left click is probably like a foot pedal.
[15219.16s -> 15220.28s]  Yeah, it is.
[15220.28s -> 15223.51s]  I don't know how you knew that.
[15223.51s -> 15223.99s]  That's weird.
[15225.45s -> 15226.25s]  All right.
[15226.25s -> 15228.57s]  Yeah, the lockpicking is actually very hard.
[15228.57s -> 15229.93s]  It's not simple.
[15229.93s -> 15234.89s]  Yeah, I thought it was going to be a whole menu, not like a jump scare.
[15234.89s -> 15236.15s]  It's over.
[15236.23s -> 15239.43s]  Well, I was envisioned like Splinter Cell Chaos Theory lockpicking
[15239.43s -> 15241.91s]  and I was very wrong when I got to do it the first time.
[15258.04s -> 15258.76s]  Well done, boys.
[15258.76s -> 15259.16s]  Well done.
[15259.16s -> 15261.46s]  I'll hit them for good measure.
[15261.46s -> 15262.50s]  Teamwork, baby.
[15262.50s -> 15262.90s]  We did it.
[15262.90s -> 15263.94s]  That's what it's all about.
[15263.94s -> 15265.62s]  I saw your you took your pants off.
[15265.62s -> 15266.18s]  I saw you.
[15269.11s -> 15273.14s]  You didn't see anything.
[15273.14s -> 15273.54s]  Stop.
[15273.54s -> 15273.94s]  Stop.
[15273.94s -> 15274.42s]  Stop.
[15274.42s -> 15275.62s]  Oh, there's a lockpick.
[15275.62s -> 15277.06s]  Do you want someone to try it again?
[15278.94s -> 15280.30s]  Are you decent at this dirty?
[15280.30s -> 15280.86s]  Want to try it again?
[15282.81s -> 15283.69s]  I would like to try.
[15283.69s -> 15284.65s]  I don't have any more lockpicks.
[15284.65s -> 15285.29s]  There's one right here.
[15285.29s -> 15288.01s]  I'm going to I'm going to fully acknowledge that I'm trash at them.
[15288.25s -> 15290.01s]  And again, my my character is actually dumb.
[15290.01s -> 15290.97s]  Also, I have a rapier for you.
[15290.97s -> 15292.65s]  If you need my friend, stir, come on.
[15292.65s -> 15294.39s]  Oh, I can.
[15294.39s -> 15296.07s]  I'll just give you it on the ground.
[15296.07s -> 15296.63s]  Can I hold on?
[15296.63s -> 15299.43s]  I'm putting I'm putting 40 arrows in this guy's head real quick.
[15300.23s -> 15301.91s]  And some of them are going through.
[15301.91s -> 15302.71s]  They're all come out.
[15302.71s -> 15303.27s]  Oh, geez.
[15303.27s -> 15303.83s]  Oh, my.
[15303.83s -> 15304.55s]  Oh, my Lord.
[15305.27s -> 15305.99s]  Oh, my God.
[15307.85s -> 15308.09s]  All right.
[15308.09s -> 15308.89s]  No guy.
[15308.89s -> 15312.01s]  For one second, I thought there was somebody in the discord call.
[15312.01s -> 15313.93s]  I was like somebody like in somebody's background coughing.
[15314.49s -> 15315.05s]  All right.
[15315.05s -> 15316.50s]  Stir lockpick.
[15316.50s -> 15317.78s]  Let's try it.
[15317.78s -> 15319.54s]  And then sort of a melee if you need it.
[15319.78s -> 15320.28s]  Okay.
[15321.38s -> 15330.22s]  No, I'll take that sword fire.
[15330.22s -> 15330.70s]  There's it.
[15331.88s -> 15332.44s]  Does it really?
[15334.23s -> 15334.55s]  No.
[15334.55s -> 15335.27s]  Yeah.
[15335.27s -> 15335.77s]  Yeah.
[15336.79s -> 15342.55s]  I was I was like, I've been I've been like wondering if there's like a way to clear that forever now.
[15342.55s -> 15343.35s]  I don't think so.
[15347.29s -> 15347.61s]  Okay.
[15347.61s -> 15351.29s]  Do I have to hit like the red part or just the yellow parts?
[15351.29s -> 15352.49s]  Yellow parts, I believe.
[15352.49s -> 15355.80s]  We're not mistaken within the yellows.
[15362.39s -> 15364.55s]  I missed it by like a tiny little bit.
[15365.69s -> 15366.41s]  It's so hard.
[15366.41s -> 15367.05s]  It's awful.
[15367.05s -> 15367.86s]  It's awful.
[15367.86s -> 15369.54s]  So what does anything slow that down?
[15369.54s -> 15371.22s]  Does resource want to slow that down?
[15371.22s -> 15375.50s]  I'm I'm I'm not positive, but I'm pretty close to positive.
[15375.50s -> 15380.70s]  I'm not like I've been told that it does by a respected source.
[15380.70s -> 15385.27s]  Okay.
[15385.27s -> 15388.07s]  Oh, I got I got a friend tango on me, tango on me.
[15388.95s -> 15389.67s]  There's people back.
[15389.67s -> 15391.35s]  No, but you do not want this dude.
[15391.35s -> 15393.35s]  I'm telling you right now in the room we just came from.
[15393.35s -> 15394.79s]  There's a guy as well.
[15394.79s -> 15396.15s]  Fire above the door behind us.
[15396.15s -> 15397.03s]  There's a guy behind us.
[15398.23s -> 15406.20s]  Don't shoot me.
[15406.20s -> 15406.68s]  Don't shoot me.
[15406.68s -> 15407.00s]  Oh, my God.
[15407.00s -> 15411.51s]  I need to heal healing.
[15411.51s -> 15412.31s]  I'll be right there in a second.
[15412.31s -> 15414.23s]  Oh, he just got hit by a mage.
[15414.23s -> 15415.19s]  Oh, my God.
[15416.79s -> 15417.19s]  Careful.
[15417.93s -> 15418.81s]  All right, boys.
[15418.81s -> 15419.69s]  Where's he at?
[15419.69s -> 15421.30s]  They ran.
[15421.30s -> 15422.50s]  There's a mage up here though.
[15422.50s -> 15423.62s]  Left or forward?
[15423.62s -> 15424.66s]  Left or forward?
[15424.66s -> 15425.22s]  Forward.
[15425.22s -> 15425.70s]  Like over here.
[15426.66s -> 15427.62s]  There's a mage in here though.
[15427.62s -> 15428.50s]  Oh, okay.
[15428.50s -> 15428.82s]  Okay.
[15428.82s -> 15429.30s]  There's okay.
[15429.30s -> 15429.86s]  Two tangos.
[15429.86s -> 15430.26s]  Got it.
[15430.26s -> 15430.76s]  Yeah.
[15431.38s -> 15432.26s]  Here's my lock pick room.
[15434.46s -> 15435.18s]  Bueno.
[15435.18s -> 15436.46s]  They're shooting arrows at us, I think.
[15437.78s -> 15439.46s]  I don't know if that's fell down the hole.
[15439.46s -> 15440.34s]  Fell down the hole.
[15440.34s -> 15441.46s]  I fell down the hole.
[15441.46s -> 15441.86s]  Oh, no.
[15441.86s -> 15443.46s]  Fell down the hole on the other room.
[15444.18s -> 15446.26s]  I need to heal before I come get you.
[15446.26s -> 15446.66s]  Or help.
[15447.62s -> 15449.61s]  Fell down the hole.
[15449.61s -> 15450.81s]  Who is shooting?
[15450.81s -> 15451.21s]  That's me.
[15451.21s -> 15452.97s]  There's a barbarian on the other hallway.
[15454.33s -> 15454.73s]  I see.
[15456.04s -> 15456.54s]  Nope.
[15458.60s -> 15458.84s]  Wow.
[15458.84s -> 15460.04s]  I didn't even see the hole.
[15460.04s -> 15461.40s]  Oh, we were doing so well.
[15461.40s -> 15462.04s]  What happened?
[15462.04s -> 15462.54s]  All right.
[15464.50s -> 15465.46s]  If you want to lead them up,
[15465.46s -> 15468.18s]  and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to fire them.
[15468.18s -> 15468.82s]  Oh, beautiful.
[15468.82s -> 15469.62s]  That's a beautiful trap.
[15471.94s -> 15472.18s]  Watch out.
[15472.18s -> 15472.82s]  Hole, hole, hole.
[15472.82s -> 15473.38s]  Watch out.
[15473.38s -> 15473.88s]  Beautiful.
[15475.15s -> 15476.91s]  We're better off closing the door first.
[15476.91s -> 15478.59s]  I'm going to act like the door is fucked.
[15478.59s -> 15478.91s]  Yep.
[15478.91s -> 15479.39s]  Exactly.
[15479.39s -> 15479.71s]  Boom.
[15479.71s -> 15480.19s]  I didn't watch.
[15484.68s -> 15493.34s]  I didn't even see the hole.
[15493.34s -> 15495.34s]  It's like blending into my brain on the screen.
[15496.14s -> 15499.50s]  Oh, you disabled the trap?
[15499.50s -> 15501.66s]  There is an exit down the hole, by the way.
[15501.66s -> 15502.78s]  But there's a shitload of enemies.
[15504.80s -> 15505.20s]  Fuck you.
[15505.20s -> 15505.92s]  Leave the door closed.
[15505.92s -> 15506.56s]  I like it that way.
[15507.44s -> 15517.63s]  Oh, they're shooting me through the...
[15518.19s -> 15519.95s]  I think it's four.
[15519.95s -> 15521.23s]  Bro, that's why you like that.
[15521.23s -> 15522.59s]  That's why the throwing axes are good.
[15523.32s -> 15524.28s]  That's why I like that.
[15524.28s -> 15524.92s]  Three or four people.
[15526.67s -> 15527.87s]  How did you fall down this hole?
[15527.87s -> 15530.27s]  How did I fall down it?
[15530.27s -> 15531.31s]  How did I fall down it?
[15531.31s -> 15532.27s]  You can't even...
[15532.27s -> 15533.23s]  It doesn't make any sense.
[15539.53s -> 15543.85s]  It's like the opposite ends of both extraordinary spectrums there.
[15543.85s -> 15545.37s]  Like, I just...
[15545.93s -> 15547.85s]  I was just teleported down there.
[15547.85s -> 15549.05s]  It was just like, boop.
[15549.05s -> 15551.85s]  And you are desperately trying to fall through it.
[15551.85s -> 15553.29s]  And you can't get through it.
[15553.85s -> 15556.28s]  It doesn't make any sense to my brain.
[15556.28s -> 15557.56s]  I'm a big boy.
[15557.56s -> 15559.79s]  Hard to fit through and you got a full diapy.
[15562.75s -> 15563.79s]  We had two groups.
[15563.79s -> 15565.71s]  There were three to our right and three to our left.
[15566.27s -> 15567.40s]  I may have fallen down a hole.
[15567.40s -> 15568.20s]  But whatever.
[15568.20s -> 15568.76s]  It's all right.
[15568.76s -> 15569.40s]  Let's go.
[15569.40s -> 15570.72s]  Go again.
[15570.72s -> 15574.00s]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[15574.00s -> 15575.68s]  Yes, just one second.
[15575.68s -> 15581.05s]  I know, I know.
[15581.05s -> 15582.09s]  There have been worse people.
[15583.88s -> 15586.28s]  I literally cannot get kills without weapons.
[15586.28s -> 15589.00s]  That's not the starting weapon on this character.
[15589.00s -> 15589.80s]  That's so funny.
[15590.52s -> 15593.72s]  You know, I know how you feel after I put seven arrows into one zombie's head.
[15595.31s -> 15597.95s]  Yeah, like this is not a game where you use base gear.
[15597.95s -> 15600.59s]  Like, you do not use base gear if you're not...
[15600.59s -> 15602.51s]  Like, if you're doing a scav run, sure.
[15602.51s -> 15603.87s]  Like, where you're literally just looting and running.
[15603.87s -> 15605.63s]  If you want to do one of those, we can do those.
[15605.63s -> 15606.75s]  There's no...
[15606.75s -> 15609.64s]  There's no Fletcher.
[15609.64s -> 15611.88s]  There's no traveling Fletcher.
[15611.88s -> 15614.96s]  You know, I'm going to prove it.
[15614.96s -> 15615.52s]  You know what?
[15615.52s -> 15616.16s]  That's it.
[15616.16s -> 15616.96s]  I got a lot of money.
[15616.96s -> 15617.68s]  That's a good idea.
[15618.40s -> 15619.84s]  You should probably buy gear.
[15619.84s -> 15621.60s]  You'll kill shit a lot faster.
[15621.60s -> 15622.56s]  Yeah, even if...
[15622.56s -> 15623.28s]  I'll make more money.
[15624.00s -> 15625.76s]  I'm going to buy this.
[15625.76s -> 15626.32s]  No, I'm not.
[15626.32s -> 15626.88s]  100 bucks.
[15627.52s -> 15627.84s]  I'm going to...
[15627.84s -> 15628.24s]  You know what?
[15628.24s -> 15629.12s]  Let's gamble.
[15629.12s -> 15629.84s]  I'm going for it.
[15629.84s -> 15633.76s]  I've been waiting to do this for the last, like, two days, three days.
[15633.76s -> 15635.84s]  Stuff kind of sucks.
[15635.84s -> 15638.52s]  I have a Battleaxe here.
[15638.52s -> 15641.24s]  Do you want me to buy it, gamble it, and if it's good, just give it to you?
[15643.23s -> 15645.47s]  Yeah, but if it's trash, I'm going to feel bad, you know?
[15645.47s -> 15648.60s]  I mean, I have money.
[15648.60s -> 15649.56s]  I mean, yeah, dude.
[15649.56s -> 15650.60s]  I'll try it once.
[15650.60s -> 15651.16s]  Is it worth it?
[15653.44s -> 15654.32s]  I have heard bad...
[15654.32s -> 15656.16s]  Wait, are you talking about the Goblin Battleaxe guy?
[15656.16s -> 15657.76s]  I got a green Battleaxe.
[15657.76s -> 15660.72s]  47 damage plus 2.5% physical damage.
[15660.72s -> 15661.85s]  Do you want it?
[15661.85s -> 15662.49s]  Yeah, I'll run it.
[15662.49s -> 15662.89s]  Absolutely.
[15662.89s -> 15663.37s]  Okay, all right.
[15663.37s -> 15665.93s]  I'm going to try it at least once.
[15665.93s -> 15666.49s]  Yeah.
[15666.49s -> 15667.13s]  That's pretty good.
[15667.13s -> 15667.85s]  Green, yeah.
[15667.85s -> 15669.93s]  Yeah, that's a lot better than what I have, so...
[15669.93s -> 15672.14s]  Yeah, okay.
[15672.14s -> 15672.62s]  And then I'm just going to...
[15672.62s -> 15676.27s]  I have a short sword for you, by the way, Stern.
[15676.27s -> 15676.59s]  Okay.
[15677.98s -> 15679.18s]  I don't want to bring this.
[15679.18s -> 15680.57s]  I'm going to lose it.
[15680.57s -> 15686.06s]  I'm bringing two Lockpicks that I'm going to immediately drop.
[15686.06s -> 15687.74s]  Oh, who sells the Lockpicks?
[15687.74s -> 15689.60s]  I believe Blacksmith.
[15689.60s -> 15690.08s]  Let me check.
[15691.95s -> 15695.02s]  Or I am wrong.
[15695.02s -> 15695.42s]  Maybe...
[15702.91s -> 15704.35s]  Interesting choice.
[15704.35s -> 15706.04s]  No, the Woodsman doesn't have them for me.
[15706.04s -> 15707.40s]  Maybe it's a momentary thing.
[15711.74s -> 15715.42s]  They all just, for me, they're all selling default gear
[15715.42s -> 15720.06s]  that you don't want to buy for very large amounts of money.
[15721.80s -> 15723.50s]  8 to like 10.
[15723.50s -> 15724.38s]  Maybe because I'm level 2.
[15727.07s -> 15727.63s]  Stern, I'll get you something.
[15727.63s -> 15728.19s]  What do you want?
[15728.19s -> 15729.93s]  No, I'm good.
[15729.93s -> 15730.65s]  I want to start.
[15731.69s -> 15737.69s]  Yeah, I hate to bring this up, but there is a Purple's Y-Hander on my merch.
[15737.69s -> 15738.89s]  Just wanted to let you know that.
[15738.89s -> 15742.83s]  I know you're a big...
[15742.83s -> 15746.25s]  I am a pretty big Zweiander fan.
[15746.25s -> 15749.02s]  I'm just going to get some default shit.
[15749.02s -> 15752.09s]  Why not?
[15752.09s -> 15753.88s]  Just don't buy grays.
[15753.88s -> 15756.20s]  If you buy a white for eight gold, that makes sense
[15756.20s -> 15759.82s]  because it's at least slightly better in some runs.
[15759.82s -> 15762.97s]  But if you can buy greens off the merchant, that's fine.
[15762.97s -> 15766.25s]  Oh, you said do not buy gray items.
[15766.25s -> 15766.99s]  Correct.
[15766.99s -> 15767.39s]  Okay.
[15767.39s -> 15768.43s]  Just don't bother.
[15768.43s -> 15772.51s]  No, so don't bother at all.
[15772.51s -> 15772.99s]  Okay.
[15772.99s -> 15774.70s]  I see what you mean.
[15774.70s -> 15775.26s]  Oh, no.
[15775.26s -> 15779.61s]  Make sure I clarify that and I want to make sure I get it right.
[15780.81s -> 15781.53s]  Oh, nice.
[15781.69s -> 15787.63s]  Is that a gray weapon or stuff from the Armorsmith?
[15787.63s -> 15788.35s]  I had it from before.
[15788.91s -> 15790.67s]  I just want to make sure I didn't do something stupid.
[15791.39s -> 15793.47s]  If anything, if it means anything, you look for it.
[15793.47s -> 15795.61s]  All right.
[15795.61s -> 15796.49s]  I got a cool axe for you.
[15797.47s -> 15798.51s]  Oh, God bless.
[15798.51s -> 15806.20s]  Here you go.
[15806.20s -> 15807.32s]  Oh, you're a madman.
[15807.32s -> 15809.93s]  Do not pick up these because they're crap.
[15811.21s -> 15812.01s]  Holy shit.
[15813.05s -> 15813.69s]  That's right.
[15816.43s -> 15817.31s]  That's the lobby.
[15819.20s -> 15820.48s]  Did you just drop stuff?
[15820.48s -> 15821.36s]  He did, dude.
[15821.36s -> 15822.72s]  He's a madman.
[15823.04s -> 15827.34s]  Actually, bro, you are the catalyst of chaos.
[15827.34s -> 15828.86s]  Holy shit, dude.
[15828.86s -> 15829.82s]  I'm sorry.
[15829.82s -> 15830.54s]  Did you get it?
[15831.18s -> 15831.98s]  I got it, bro.
[15831.98s -> 15834.62s]  But I had to go through Stern's body, too.
[15834.62s -> 15837.10s]  I was like, oh, my God, please don't be another player.
[15839.12s -> 15839.44s]  All right.
[15839.44s -> 15839.92s]  Here's your sword.
[15839.92s -> 15840.48s]  Here's your sword.
[15842.94s -> 15843.66s]  Oh, my God.
[15843.66s -> 15845.02s]  I just I'm not even realizing.
[15845.02s -> 15846.30s]  Oh, God, bro.
[15846.30s -> 15846.86s]  Jesus.
[15848.62s -> 15851.02s]  Jesus.
[15856.04s -> 15857.48s]  I got to get a hold of myself here.
[15858.20s -> 15858.60s]  All right.
[15860.11s -> 15862.49s]  Did you get the lockpicks?
[15862.49s -> 15862.73s]  Yes.
[15863.45s -> 15865.68s]  Here you go.
[15865.68s -> 15866.16s]  Oh, good.
[15866.16s -> 15867.04s]  I thought I killed him.
[15867.04s -> 15868.35s]  Jesus.
[15868.35s -> 15871.63s]  There is a good armor here for people that like wearing armor.
[15872.19s -> 15872.59s]  Watch out.
[15872.59s -> 15878.35s]  He's oh, God.
[15878.35s -> 15879.87s]  I'm going to hit this lockpick.
[15879.87s -> 15880.64s]  God.
[15880.64s -> 15881.76s]  Oh, you got this.
[15881.76s -> 15882.56s]  So big.
[15882.56s -> 15883.92s]  I'm going to hit it big.
[15884.48s -> 15885.44s]  Hit it big.
[15885.44s -> 15886.64s]  Hit it well.
[15886.64s -> 15888.40s]  Come on, Stern.
[15888.40s -> 15890.59s]  We believe in you.
[15890.59s -> 15892.99s]  Can you just can you watch it go around once?
[15895.40s -> 15896.04s]  I believe not.
[15896.04s -> 15897.24s]  I think you have to just do it.
[15898.17s -> 15900.33s]  It comes up at such a random time.
[15900.89s -> 15902.81s]  I'm not used to where it is on the screen.
[15904.52s -> 15905.00s]  It changes.
[15905.00s -> 15905.72s]  It changes.
[15905.72s -> 15906.92s]  That's the fun part.
[15906.92s -> 15907.64s]  Take this.
[15907.64s -> 15910.65s]  Take this chest plate, please.
[15910.65s -> 15911.53s]  Come on, dude.
[15911.53s -> 15912.25s]  Fucking get it.
[15917.16s -> 15919.40s]  I thought you're going to run on the traps and off yourself.
[15919.40s -> 15922.08s]  Can you take this?
[15922.08s -> 15922.72s]  I can't wear that.
[15922.72s -> 15924.16s]  I mean, I'm it.
[15924.16s -> 15926.08s]  I meant wait, wait, wait.
[15926.08s -> 15926.64s]  Hold on, Stern.
[15926.64s -> 15930.27s]  Did I just do like 20% of your health in one punch?
[15930.27s -> 15932.11s]  No, the punches don't mess around.
[15932.11s -> 15933.95s]  They're like 20 damage, at least.
[15933.95s -> 15936.43s]  I I thought it.
[15936.43s -> 15936.75s]  All right.
[15936.75s -> 15937.07s]  All right.
[15937.07s -> 15938.11s]  I did it once.
[15938.19s -> 15939.63s]  I did it once.
[15939.63s -> 15941.07s]  I did it once.
[15941.07s -> 15942.03s]  You want to even it out?
[15942.03s -> 15942.67s]  That's what happened.
[15942.67s -> 15943.39s]  Diabe.
[15943.39s -> 15944.83s]  That's what's he doing?
[15944.83s -> 15945.87s]  Why are you doing this?
[15945.87s -> 15953.16s]  You just feel like I just feel like I'm getting bullied.
[15953.16s -> 15955.80s]  I'm angry because I failed the jump scare twice.
[15957.88s -> 15958.28s]  All right.
[15958.28s -> 15958.68s]  All right.
[15958.68s -> 15958.92s]  All right.
[15958.92s -> 15960.52s]  Let's fucking go for it.
[15960.52s -> 15961.40s]  Civil War.
[15962.28s -> 15971.72s]  Secret wall.
[15971.72s -> 15975.80s]  Again, that's almost stepped on.
[15975.80s -> 15976.44s]  Oh, my God.
[15976.44s -> 15977.88s]  I almost stepped on the trap there.
[15980.43s -> 15983.76s]  Let us know to be fair.
[15983.76s -> 15985.60s]  It really is like impossible.
[15986.59s -> 15987.31s]  It's rough.
[15987.31s -> 15988.67s]  It shouldn't be as hard as it is.
[15988.67s -> 15990.67s]  But I guess the reward is really great
[15990.67s -> 15992.27s]  because there could be something really amazing.
[16004.67s -> 16006.32s]  I want to be able to see.
[16010.68s -> 16011.48s]  Oh, there's a tomb.
[16017.04s -> 16018.88s]  We got tangos by us.
[16019.77s -> 16021.45s]  Rogue helmet on the ground.
[16026.33s -> 16028.41s]  I think they're north.
[16028.41s -> 16030.01s]  Maybe watch out tangos.
[16037.18s -> 16039.10s]  Yeah, because those don't go off for no reason.
[16039.10s -> 16040.78s]  So they're absolutely fighting something.
[16041.58s -> 16043.02s]  Well, let them let them get hurt.
[16044.97s -> 16046.09s]  Oh, he's metagaming.
[16047.42s -> 16048.46s]  I mean, that's what you said.
[16049.93s -> 16052.65s]  That's we're going by the smartest gamer in the room right now.
[16052.65s -> 16054.09s]  I think it might actually it might be.
[16055.21s -> 16055.93s]  I'll calm down.
[16055.93s -> 16056.73s]  Calm down.
[16056.73s -> 16058.25s]  My knowledge is five.
[16058.25s -> 16061.21s]  OK, I have to I have to open this
[16061.21s -> 16062.81s]  because I have to go get that health over there.
[16062.81s -> 16063.61s]  Watch the spider.
[16063.61s -> 16064.97s]  So spiders welcoming.
[16066.33s -> 16066.65s]  All right.
[16066.65s -> 16070.41s]  Running through running through and spawning these.
[16070.41s -> 16071.53s]  Come help me kill them.
[16071.53s -> 16072.09s]  Pressing E.
[16073.05s -> 16073.45s]  Kill.
[16075.05s -> 16080.81s]  Can you shoot the scaly archer jail?
[16081.61s -> 16081.85s]  Yeah.
[16082.41s -> 16083.69s]  Otherwise, he's going to farm me.
[16087.71s -> 16096.56s]  I'm doing it.
[16096.56s -> 16097.60s]  I'm shooting them.
[16100.16s -> 16101.20s]  He's not.
[16101.20s -> 16102.00s]  Oh, there's like loading.
[16102.00s -> 16104.00s]  There's like bugs, whatever they are stuck under there.
[16104.72s -> 16106.40s]  Careful, like bat things.
[16106.40s -> 16106.96s]  Getting them.
[16108.24s -> 16108.96s]  I'm shooting them.
[16111.12s -> 16111.60s]  Oh, my God.
[16113.44s -> 16114.40s]  What the fuck?
[16115.12s -> 16117.20s]  These should be an arrow.
[16117.20s -> 16117.60s]  Oh, yeah.
[16117.60s -> 16121.23s]  You I was shooting that guy and you know.
[16121.23s -> 16122.11s]  Why would it be accurate to me?
[16122.11s -> 16122.75s]  That was not you.
[16123.31s -> 16130.01s]  Jews in here.
[16130.01s -> 16132.94s]  But man, that's an emerald.
[16138.03s -> 16141.24s]  Diabla, do you have bandages?
[16143.71s -> 16147.95s]  He should have a campfire, which is I believe I have one.
[16148.92s -> 16149.56s]  I have two.
[16149.56s -> 16153.47s]  If you want to heal without us needing to use the campfire.
[16153.47s -> 16155.63s]  I have food I can eat as well.
[16155.63s -> 16156.51s]  Oh, that's right.
[16156.51s -> 16157.07s]  That's true.
[16157.07s -> 16158.83s]  But that almost is like too good.
[16158.83s -> 16160.57s]  And well, it's OK.
[16160.57s -> 16164.81s]  Although I will say that that health shrine does regen if we chill here for a sec.
[16164.81s -> 16170.72s]  Oh, oh, my.
[16170.72s -> 16173.76s]  Have you stand next to this altar of sacrifice?
[16173.76s -> 16174.72s]  It whispers.
[16174.72s -> 16175.52s]  Have you heard it?
[16175.52s -> 16177.87s]  It's scary, actually.
[16177.87s -> 16183.23s]  Repeat this crap is now.
[16184.68s -> 16186.12s]  Well, not quite yet.
[16186.12s -> 16188.36s]  I'll keep it for now because I buy a lot.
[16188.36s -> 16189.32s]  I got a long suit.
[16191.29s -> 16193.92s]  Oh, you did.
[16193.92s -> 16195.92s]  I would love to take that.
[16195.92s -> 16196.78s]  What do you?
[16196.78s -> 16197.42s]  Oh, yeah.
[16197.42s -> 16199.76s]  Oh, you salute me.
[16202.14s -> 16205.18s]  Yeah.
[16205.18s -> 16205.82s]  Cool.
[16205.82s -> 16208.08s]  Beautiful.
[16208.08s -> 16209.93s]  Cool.
[16209.93s -> 16210.49s]  Cool.
[16210.49s -> 16214.80s]  Cool.
[16214.80s -> 16215.12s]  Cool.
[16215.12s -> 16217.02s]  Oh, wow.
[16217.02s -> 16217.42s]  Mimic.
[16217.42s -> 16218.14s]  Still gets me.
[16218.14s -> 16218.94s]  Still gets me.
[16218.94s -> 16221.92s]  Oh, cool, cool, cool.
[16226.48s -> 16228.48s]  I just feel cool with the longsword.
[16228.48s -> 16230.24s]  It's just the swing is so cool.
[16230.24s -> 16231.12s]  I like the second swing.
[16231.12s -> 16231.76s]  It's my favorite.
[16231.76s -> 16234.40s]  So do the mimics have better stuff in them?
[16234.40s -> 16235.36s]  I was just going to bring that up.
[16235.36s -> 16239.12s]  You would think, but I have not seen anything with that.
[16246.20s -> 16246.70s]  OK.
[16249.20s -> 16250.48s]  This way, probably.
[16250.48s -> 16251.20s]  Look through.
[16251.20s -> 16252.64s]  If you're through, I don't see anything.
[16252.64s -> 16254.00s]  Yeah, we can go.
[16254.08s -> 16261.47s]  It will just make two lefts and basically reroute in to the circle.
[16261.47s -> 16266.11s]  There have been looters here.
[16266.11s -> 16267.31s]  I'm going to deal.
[16267.31s -> 16268.62s]  Let's get the full health.
[16272.64s -> 16275.44s]  People always want to do it in this little area in here.
[16275.44s -> 16276.56s]  This little hidey hole.
[16276.56s -> 16279.18s]  Let's do it.
[16279.18s -> 16280.06s]  Let's go in.
[16280.06s -> 16281.95s]  It'll be super safe when I close the lever.
[16284.80s -> 16286.16s]  But there'll be stuff in here.
[16286.16s -> 16288.19s]  I'll say that.
[16288.91s -> 16291.31s]  For some reason, I had assumed you'd use campfire.
[16291.31s -> 16293.71s]  Do you want this helmet?
[16293.71s -> 16295.47s]  It's a plus four physical power green.
[16295.47s -> 16299.64s]  I feel like you should be the one that has this on the ground.
[16299.64s -> 16300.28s]  Oh, wow.
[16300.28s -> 16302.75s]  Yes, I would love that.
[16302.75s -> 16308.89s]  You are the physical power, important wielder of acts.
[16308.89s -> 16315.53s]  You can't break with torches.
[16315.53s -> 16316.73s]  Oh, wow.
[16316.73s -> 16318.57s]  Maybe I should have just left it closed.
[16318.57s -> 16320.21s]  Oh, shit.
[16334.51s -> 16335.79s]  Oh, we got bugs.
[16335.79s -> 16336.35s]  Poison bug.
[16336.91s -> 16339.05s]  Did I get hit by it?
[16339.93s -> 16340.41s]  I did.
[16340.41s -> 16340.65s]  How?
[16340.65s -> 16341.45s]  I was behind the wall.
[16362.09s -> 16364.49s]  That poison gas is just such a great zoner.
[16364.49s -> 16365.05s]  It's the worst.
[16366.17s -> 16366.67s]  Yep.
[16372.28s -> 16373.24s]  Did I hit you?
[16373.24s -> 16373.48s]  Nope.
[16373.48s -> 16373.96s]  Thank God.
[16376.57s -> 16376.81s]  All right.
[16376.81s -> 16377.61s]  We got to run, run.
[16378.81s -> 16379.69s]  You should take Doris.
[16385.48s -> 16386.04s]  Oh, my God.
[16386.04s -> 16387.00s]  Get out of the fucking way.
[16393.60s -> 16395.36s]  We got to get the hell out of here right now.
[16404.30s -> 16408.33s]  We'll be all right.
[16408.33s -> 16408.83s]  Beautiful.
[16410.97s -> 16411.69s]  What the fuck?
[16411.69s -> 16413.08s]  Isn't that an archer?
[16413.08s -> 16413.80s]  Oh, what is it?
[16413.80s -> 16415.80s]  No, we got players shooting for us across the way.
[16415.80s -> 16418.88s]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[16418.88s -> 16420.16s]  I need to heal somewhere.
[16421.12s -> 16422.56s]  That guy's got a big ass shield.
[16422.56s -> 16423.44s]  I'm going to sit here for a second.
[16424.00s -> 16427.84s]  Yep.
[16427.84s -> 16428.56s]  Careful, Ster.
[16428.56s -> 16429.92s]  Oh, I actually don't have heals.
[16429.92s -> 16430.56s]  This is amazing.
[16431.68s -> 16433.28s]  I have a bandage and I have a potion.
[16433.28s -> 16433.84s]  You should put it here.
[16433.84s -> 16434.34s]  Let me.
[16437.58s -> 16440.38s]  Yeah, if you appreciate it.
[16440.38s -> 16441.18s]  Thank you, thank you.
[16441.18s -> 16442.22s]  Oh, gosh.
[16442.22s -> 16442.78s]  Did you get them both?
[16444.04s -> 16444.60s]  Yeah, thank you.
[16445.64s -> 16447.96s]  It's better in your hands than it is in mine.
[16447.96s -> 16449.61s]  No, no, no.
[16449.61s -> 16450.33s]  We are a team.
[16454.19s -> 16456.27s]  Well, apparently he has a good aim.
[16456.27s -> 16457.63s]  And I fucking jumped down.
[16457.63s -> 16459.47s]  I did a movement speed buff.
[16459.47s -> 16462.03s]  I did a movement speed buff and everything and I didn't make it.
[16462.67s -> 16463.39s]  Actually, I'll shut up.
[16463.39s -> 16463.71s]  Sorry.
[16463.71s -> 16464.43s]  I'm dead.
[16464.43s -> 16467.00s]  Like, there's no getting out of this.
[16467.00s -> 16468.38s]  Owie.
[16468.38s -> 16475.34s]  So how did I not get that?
[16475.34s -> 16478.57s]  I the jump there is kind of trash sometimes.
[16478.57s -> 16481.45s]  I even did movement speed and I like just I waited as long as I could.
[16481.45s -> 16487.60s]  I just didn't make it.
[16487.60s -> 16488.08s]  Oh, it's good.
[16488.08s -> 16490.72s]  I think I was slow from all the gear I had on.
[16490.72s -> 16491.12s]  All right.
[16491.12s -> 16492.40s]  I think we should be a little toxic.
[16493.66s -> 16494.78s]  I have an idea.
[16494.78s -> 16503.79s]  Grouch jump for extra height.
[16503.79s -> 16508.27s]  It doesn't really help with distance, but he is right.
[16509.66s -> 16511.74s]  I think I just had too much gear on.
[16511.74s -> 16515.18s]  I just didn't realize because I thought, oh, I'm going to do my movement speed buff
[16515.18s -> 16516.22s]  and I'll be able to get some momentum.
[16516.22s -> 16519.23s]  It just didn't help.
[16519.23s -> 16519.87s]  Wait.
[16519.87s -> 16523.82s]  Nothing's changed.
[16523.82s -> 16526.43s]  What's up?
[16526.43s -> 16527.47s]  I don't even have it on.
[16529.77s -> 16532.27s]  Oh, that's interesting.
[16532.27s -> 16534.59s]  I must have changed it and forgot that I changed it.
[16537.68s -> 16539.04s]  I haven't been doing movement speed.
[16539.04s -> 16541.84s]  I've been doing victory, victory strike.
[16541.84s -> 16546.03s]  So every time I press that, I'm just trying to run fast.
[16546.03s -> 16550.54s]  Sir, thank you so much for the raid.
[16551.93s -> 16552.89s]  Stir to the right song.
[16556.20s -> 16557.72s]  What do the raid song?
[16558.36s -> 16559.34s]  That's not a raid song.
[16559.34s -> 16559.98s]  It's a break song.
[16559.98s -> 16560.70s]  But do you want to hear it?
[16560.70s -> 16563.82s]  It's actually kind of I actually no, I'm good.
[16564.54s -> 16565.42s]  I'm not going to sing it.
[16565.42s -> 16566.62s]  I was going to play it in a stream.
[16566.62s -> 16567.34s]  Geez.
[16567.34s -> 16567.66s]  Okay.
[16567.66s -> 16568.54s]  Never mind.
[16568.54s -> 16569.34s]  Okay.
[16569.34s -> 16570.22s]  Okay.
[16570.22s -> 16573.13s]  Jeremy, can you do the raid song?
[16573.13s -> 16576.35s]  Oh, story.
[16576.35s -> 16580.16s]  Are you are you on your way out here?
[16580.16s -> 16582.64s]  Um, I can play like another.
[16582.64s -> 16585.23s]  I like what I mean.
[16585.23s -> 16586.59s]  I've been up a while.
[16586.59s -> 16587.15s]  I like this.
[16587.15s -> 16587.71s]  Right.
[16587.71s -> 16587.95s]  Right.
[16587.95s -> 16588.59s]  Gosh.
[16588.59s -> 16592.49s]  Wrong.
[16592.49s -> 16592.97s]  All right.
[16592.97s -> 16594.80s]  Let's do let's do another one.
[16594.80s -> 16597.13s]  Let's go for real this time.
[16597.13s -> 16597.37s]  All right.
[16597.37s -> 16599.18s]  Let's run it.
[16599.18s -> 16600.38s]  We are arranged kings.
[16604.11s -> 16604.59s]  So it's funny.
[16604.59s -> 16607.15s]  You rated me right as I put up my BRB screen, right?
[16607.71s -> 16608.91s]  Which has a song that I made.
[16611.13s -> 16614.49s]  No, no, I just I put it up for a second because I got up for a second
[16614.49s -> 16618.17s]  because like anytime I get up from my desk, I still have the ability to hear
[16618.17s -> 16619.85s]  because I have wireless headphones.
[16619.85s -> 16620.41s]  Anyways.
[16620.41s -> 16620.81s]  Oh, cool.
[16620.81s -> 16622.41s]  And like when you came in, you like do the raid song.
[16622.41s -> 16624.41s]  I thought you meant like my song was the raid song.
[16624.41s -> 16625.93s]  I didn't even know there was a raid song.
[16625.93s -> 16627.21s]  Oh, I don't know.
[16627.21s -> 16627.77s]  That's why I don't.
[16629.64s -> 16632.38s]  My brain checked out with the worm.
[16632.38s -> 16633.74s]  You think you can test the meat?
[16633.74s -> 16634.14s]  Look at me.
[16634.14s -> 16635.10s]  It's all gone.
[16635.10s -> 16641.66s]  It's always funny to hear the the 0.5 seconds people have in the voice chat in the lobby
[16641.66s -> 16644.38s]  and they're just going to get their one sentence out, whatever it is.
[16644.38s -> 16683.55s]  Got something over here.
[16683.55s -> 16684.51s]  Oh, what is this?
[16684.51s -> 16686.51s]  Is this just not is this a weird?
[16686.51s -> 16688.59s]  That's where the people used to spawn in.
[16688.59s -> 16693.69s]  Remember how like everybody was like like those little boxes on the outskirts of the map.
[16693.69s -> 16696.57s]  You just like well, I guess you just you didn't play earlier, did you?
[16696.57s -> 16696.97s]  No, I didn't.
[16696.97s -> 16700.12s]  This is the first test I played in the earlier play test.
[16700.12s -> 16700.76s]  Oh, check this out.
[16700.76s -> 16703.16s]  Check this out and fire sword.
[16703.16s -> 16706.62s]  Have fun and fire bow.
[16709.00s -> 16709.56s]  I'm so afraid.
[16709.56s -> 16711.56s]  I'm going to this thing is the fire.
[16711.56s -> 16712.60s]  So it's freaking me out.
[16712.60s -> 16713.00s]  I don't know.
[16713.00s -> 16714.60s]  I can't I can't I can't fucking use it.
[16716.04s -> 16717.40s]  I can't play with it.
[16717.40s -> 16718.20s]  It's weird.
[16718.84s -> 16719.72s]  I think it was a deep off.
[16719.72s -> 16720.84s]  Don't give that to me again.
[16720.84s -> 16721.64s]  That was a debuff.
[16722.28s -> 16723.68s]  All right.
[16723.68s -> 16724.48s]  Well, you know what?
[16724.48s -> 16727.04s]  Honestly, I'm just going to go off the wizard.
[16727.04s -> 16727.36s]  Sorry.
[16727.36s -> 16727.68s]  I'm sorry.
[16727.68s -> 16729.12s]  I thought this was a good idea.
[16729.20s -> 16732.24s]  It was just too I was so foreign to me too much power.
[16732.24s -> 16736.08s]  It just was so foreign to me that I just it was something I'd never seen.
[16740.17s -> 16742.89s]  There's a wraith in here that I think we might be able to kill a little bit of.
[16743.77s -> 16744.17s]  Never mind.
[16744.17s -> 16745.45s]  It's an awful lot.
[16745.45s -> 16746.99s]  Why can I not break?
[16747.95s -> 16757.55s]  You just got to believe points incoming.
[16757.55s -> 16758.19s]  Thanks, Jerma.
[16758.19s -> 16759.47s]  Well, you don't know that actually.
[16765.28s -> 16766.16s]  Thanks, but no thanks.
[16766.16s -> 16767.60s]  Thanks, but no thanks to what?
[16767.60s -> 16768.40s]  Oh, friends.
[16768.40s -> 16768.64s]  All right.
[16768.64s -> 16769.44s]  Watch out.
[16769.44s -> 16770.24s]  Hold on.
[16770.24s -> 16771.80s]  So here's the fun part.
[16771.80s -> 16774.84s]  We get to be so toxic with your arrows and my fireballs.
[16777.04s -> 16779.28s]  And my apps and my thank you.
[16779.28s -> 16780.64s]  I was trying to get to the exit.
[16780.64s -> 16781.04s]  We came in.
[16781.04s -> 16781.44s]  It's coming in.
[16781.44s -> 16783.68s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16783.68s -> 16784.80s]  And I'm dead.
[16784.80s -> 16785.52s]  Beautiful.
[16785.52s -> 16786.16s]  All right.
[16786.16s -> 16787.12s]  This one doesn't count.
[16787.12s -> 16787.62s]  No.
[16789.29s -> 16789.79s]  That one.
[16790.33s -> 16791.29s]  Oh, there's somebody behind me.
[16791.29s -> 16795.64s]  Fuck.
[16795.64s -> 16797.08s]  There's no way we're letting that happen.
[16797.08s -> 16797.56s]  There's no way.
[16797.56s -> 16798.04s]  I'm sorry.
[16798.04s -> 16798.54s]  Nope.
[16799.16s -> 16799.66s]  I'm done.
[16800.84s -> 16801.48s]  Hey, bedtime.
[16803.85s -> 16804.57s]  Get real late.
[16805.95s -> 16807.23s]  I got to go get in my crib.
[16809.05s -> 16809.85s]  Understandable.
[16809.85s -> 16811.90s]  Thank you, sir.
[16811.90s -> 16813.02s]  Yeah, no problem.
[16813.02s -> 16814.06s]  And it was nice meeting you.
[16814.06s -> 16815.02s]  And also thank you for the raid.
[16815.02s -> 16815.90s]  It was really nice.
[16815.90s -> 16816.86s]  Yeah, yeah, no problem.
[16816.86s -> 16817.84s]  Good night.
[16817.84s -> 16818.96s]  See you later, Sterk.
[16818.96s -> 16820.00s]  Thanks for playing.
[16820.00s -> 16822.84s]  Sterk is a good dude.
[16823.95s -> 16824.59s]  So what's your plan?
[16825.15s -> 16829.12s]  I might want to do some solo goblin stuff now that I have like a cool weapon.
[16829.12s -> 16831.39s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[16831.39s -> 16833.15s]  But I think that's great.
[16833.15s -> 16835.23s]  It's also a great way to get a lot of loot, a lot of money.
[16835.23s -> 16836.22s]  Yeah.
[16836.22s -> 16838.96s]  The goblin caves are fun.
[16838.96s -> 16841.04s]  They are rigorous in some ways.
[16841.04s -> 16843.84s]  And then like you will get like shitty teleports.
[16843.84s -> 16846.88s]  So well, they just they made it better and they make it easier.
[16846.88s -> 16848.88s]  They kind of nerfed a lot of stuff in it, didn't they?
[16848.88s -> 16853.28s]  I think it's a lot more like predictable with the circles now.
[16853.28s -> 16854.08s]  So maybe.
[16855.60s -> 16859.60s]  But I just went into a couple earlier and they were still kind of weird.
[16859.60s -> 16860.16s]  Cool.
[16860.16s -> 16862.56s]  Well, that's good to know because I was like, oh, they made it.
[16862.56s -> 16863.36s]  They nerfed it.
[16863.36s -> 16867.02s]  Now I'm going to go in and be a dickhead and die.
[16867.02s -> 16868.78s]  Now, the the goblins still mess you up.
[16868.78s -> 16871.58s]  If you if you even take one hit, it's a quarter of the barb's health.
[16871.58s -> 16873.26s]  And he has the highest health.
[16873.26s -> 16874.14s]  So yeah.
[16874.14s -> 16877.82s]  Yeah, it's cool to have you on stream.
[16877.82s -> 16879.10s]  Thanks for playing.
[16879.10s -> 16881.18s]  I mean, I'm going to probably be playing for at least another couple of hours.
[16881.18s -> 16883.66s]  I don't know what the plan is, but I know Kraken's got another group.
[16883.66s -> 16885.50s]  I know there's other people playing, too.
[16885.50s -> 16887.08s]  Probably can jump around again later.
[16887.08s -> 16887.80s]  I'll be on.
[16887.80s -> 16889.55s]  I'll be playing Friday as well.
[16889.55s -> 16890.19s]  So sick.
[16890.75s -> 16892.11s]  Yeah, just let me know if you need me.
[16892.11s -> 16893.71s]  Yeah, it's awesome hanging out with you.
[16893.71s -> 16894.67s]  Thanks for coming out.
[16894.67s -> 16900.57s]  And make sure we get to follow the channel, everything, because you're good, too.
[16900.57s -> 16901.96s]  Appreciate that.
[16901.96s -> 16903.72s]  And I really appreciate going on.
[16903.72s -> 16905.88s]  And it was a good time.
[16905.88s -> 16911.88s]  Mods show that please spam Twitch.tv.
[16914.12s -> 16915.08s]  Slash.
[16915.08s -> 16919.05s]  You're too nice to me.
[16919.05s -> 16921.90s]  I really appreciate it.
[16921.90s -> 16922.38s]  Thank you.
[16922.38s -> 16924.00s]  Yeah, but take care.
[16924.00s -> 16924.48s]  We'll talk to you.
[16924.48s -> 16925.44s]  I'll talk to you soon.
[16925.44s -> 16931.04s]  Mods, mods, mods.
[16931.92s -> 16940.32s]  Yeah, I met him through when I went to go do the show with Charlie.
[16940.32s -> 16943.64s]  He's part of that kind of group.
[16943.64s -> 16947.50s]  They're all really cool, really funny, really awesome.
[16947.50s -> 16949.15s]  So cool to play with them.
[16949.15s -> 16954.64s]  Oh, there we go.
[16954.64s -> 16959.63s]  That's cool.
[16959.63s -> 16969.02s]  So I do want to try the new Goblin mode, at least for a little while.
[16969.02s -> 16970.38s]  I'm not bringing this yet.
[16970.38s -> 16977.98s]  This is staying right here until the last day.
[16980.67s -> 16982.92s]  But I'm just going in.
[16982.92s -> 16986.56s]  You know, I know Omega Lully's level 20 and he's like sucks.
[16986.56s -> 16987.04s]  Yeah, whatever.
[16987.04s -> 16987.68s]  Who cares?
[16987.68s -> 16989.82s]  It's just a play test.
[16989.82s -> 16991.10s]  I'll be better next play test.
[17009.47s -> 17012.57s]  No one's going to carry you now.
[17012.57s -> 17017.74s]  I feel like 70% of the runs we did were comedy runs.
[17017.74s -> 17022.46s]  So I think it worked out pretty well.
[17022.46s -> 17025.00s]  All right, let's go.
[17025.00s -> 17034.17s]  Awful place to start.
[17034.17s -> 17035.05s]  But whatever.
[17035.05s -> 17043.61s]  Oh, that's oh, this is also not good.
[17043.61s -> 17047.74s]  This is also bad.
[17049.47s -> 17050.19s]  This is awful.
[17052.80s -> 17055.36s]  I am so glad I didn't bring this reander down here.
[17055.36s -> 17065.00s]  I think I made it up.
[17065.00s -> 17065.88s]  Oh, he swung.
[17066.68s -> 17068.36s]  Close, close, close it.
[17068.36s -> 17070.65s]  This room is equally as bad.
[17070.65s -> 17078.56s]  Oh, my God.
[17078.56s -> 17095.52s]  OK, come on, come on.
[17095.52s -> 17096.80s]  I bumped into the wall.
[17096.80s -> 17101.13s]  Well, this is a bad start.
[17101.13s -> 17102.49s]  Maybe I'll find some heals.
[17102.49s -> 17117.56s]  Pretty good.
[17117.56s -> 17124.60s]  Better than pull you over here.
[17124.60s -> 17126.04s]  This time don't get hit.
[17126.04s -> 17132.91s]  I don't want to aggro the rest of the room.
[17132.91s -> 17134.03s]  Come on, get over here.
[17134.03s -> 17156.83s]  Get over here.
[17156.83s -> 17158.59s]  Hey, would you look at that?
[17158.59s -> 17159.31s]  30.
[17159.31s -> 17162.01s]  Look, I asked and God answered.
[17162.01s -> 17176.94s]  23.
[17178.06s -> 17180.14s]  I don't really know how to use this, but I'll try it.
[17180.14s -> 17182.27s]  This thing is like a head bopper, right?
[17182.27s -> 17182.75s]  Yeah.
[17182.75s -> 17213.96s]  Anything else?
[17213.96s -> 17215.80s]  For some reason, I thought that was a guy in there.
[17215.80s -> 17225.85s]  I saw like just the shoes.
[17225.85s -> 17240.59s]  This stir stream is still on.
[17240.59s -> 17241.39s]  It is.
[17241.39s -> 17255.85s]  Hold on.
[17255.85s -> 17257.21s]  We're not like messing around, right?
[17257.21s -> 17273.26s]  Is it actually just still on?
[17273.26s -> 17274.70s]  Oh, that's one of these things.
[17274.70s -> 17289.04s]  Hold on.
[17290.00s -> 17293.72s]  I'm just kind of walking and dying, but I actually don't want.
[17293.72s -> 17296.04s]  If he doesn't know that, then I definitely want to make sure he knows.
[17315.80s -> 17316.36s]  Give me one second.
[17316.92s -> 17317.72s]  I'm going to text him.
[17317.72s -> 17322.94s]  I would definitely want someone to tell me if I did that.
[17322.94s -> 17324.88s]  Give me one second.
[17324.88s -> 17333.55s]  I'll be right back.
[17333.55s -> 17335.42s]  Concerned, Andy?
[17335.42s -> 17338.62s]  No, but I mean, if you don't know that's happening, it's just like, oh, wait, what?
[17338.62s -> 17339.87s]  Give me one second.
[17339.87s -> 17545.74s]  I'll be right back.
[17545.74s -> 17546.86s]  Okay, just give me two more seconds.
[17546.86s -> 17548.80s]  Two seconds.
[17548.80s -> 17550.08s]  I just saw the subs come in.
[17550.08s -> 17554.22s]  Yeah, dude, I appreciate that.
[17554.22s -> 17557.40s]  We should be giving subs to you, though.
[17558.40s -> 17559.60s]  Not this way.
[17559.60s -> 17562.33s]  No, it was a blast having you on.
[17562.33s -> 17571.26s]  Give me two more seconds.
[17571.26s -> 17573.42s]  Sometimes Twitch staff hangs out here.
[17573.42s -> 17575.92s]  I don't know if anybody from Twitch staff is aware of this.
[17575.92s -> 17577.20s]  Maybe they can do something about it.
[17577.20s -> 17580.17s]  I don't know.
[17580.17s -> 17589.24s]  Sometimes there's staff that lurks here.
[17589.24s -> 17591.08s]  Give me one more moment.
[17591.08s -> 17593.45s]  Don't worry, I'm going to be live for a while.
[17593.45s -> 17713.16s]  Don't worry.
[17713.16s -> 17722.43s]  Uh, I'm going to just keep playing.
[17722.43s -> 17724.19s]  Hey, look, Twitch staff.
[17724.19s -> 17727.47s]  Staff?
[17728.03s -> 17733.95s]  Staff.
[17733.95s -> 17739.53s]  Yeah, we think that Stirr may have left his stream on.
[17739.53s -> 17740.33s]  Possibly.
[17740.33s -> 17750.89s]  I think he did a raid and then I think just didn't turn the stream on.
[17750.89s -> 17760.70s]  The worms got him.
[17773.79s -> 17775.87s]  He fell asleep instantly.
[17778.36s -> 17781.32s]  I mean, he did leave very quickly.
[17781.32s -> 17782.76s]  It was like, yeah, yeah, okay, bye.
[17785.74s -> 17786.70s]  Oh, he's back.
[17786.70s -> 17787.34s]  All right.
[17787.34s -> 17789.26s]  Stirr came back.
[17789.26s -> 17799.88s]  Okay.
[17799.88s -> 17800.36s]  All right.
[17800.36s -> 17801.16s]  We good?
[17801.16s -> 17802.19s]  We're good.
[17802.19s -> 17802.51s]  We're good.
[17802.51s -> 17814.52s]  We're good.
[17814.52s -> 17815.00s]  All right.
[17815.00s -> 17815.72s]  We're good.
[17815.72s -> 17818.86s]  He said, huh?
[17818.86s -> 17829.56s]  Bro, he's going to go another 12 hours.
[17829.56s -> 17834.40s]  He put food in the oven and took a shower.
[17834.40s -> 17838.35s]  Yeah, I tried texting him.
[17838.35s -> 17844.44s]  We pinged him a few times and, you know, I think we even pinged Ashley a few times too.
[17844.44s -> 17847.23s]  All right.
[17847.23s -> 17848.11s]  Well, that's good.
[17848.11s -> 17848.99s]  Situated.
[17848.99s -> 17856.96s]  My text didn't even go through to him.
[17856.96s -> 17860.40s]  Hold on.
[17860.40s -> 17862.96s]  Wait, did he mean to do that and he was coming back?
[17862.96s -> 17864.57s]  No, I doubt it.
[17864.57s -> 17869.48s]  He got your Discord things.
[17869.48s -> 17870.36s]  Okay, good.
[17870.36s -> 17874.56s]  No, dude, he has your number blocked.
[17876.16s -> 17882.12s]  All right.
[17882.68s -> 17883.64s]  All right, that's good.
[17883.64s -> 17894.54s]  Oh, my text says not delivered.
[17894.54s -> 17895.92s]  Oh, that's weird.
[17895.92s -> 17896.75s]  Okay.
[17896.75s -> 17899.02s]  Well, we're good.
[17899.02s -> 17919.05s]  Okay, he's ending for real now.
[17919.05s -> 17919.85s]  All right, good.
[17919.85s -> 17929.69s]  Yeah, trust me when I say I would want someone to do that for me too.
[17929.69s -> 17935.26s]  If I just like left the stream on for like, yeah, it's like, hey, hey, hey, turn it off.
[17935.26s -> 17939.13s]  Because you never know.
[17939.13s -> 17941.05s]  Honestly, here's a little tip.
[17941.05s -> 17943.88s]  You just kind of don't know, right?
[17944.28s -> 17947.10s]  If you're setting a stream up, then trust me, I've been doing this before.
[17947.10s -> 17951.69s]  Like, showing up hours later and you put, I don't know how many times I've probably
[17951.69s -> 17952.97s]  sat here and fucking farted.
[17952.97s -> 17954.75s]  You know what I mean?
[17954.75s -> 17957.31s]  Or like just, oh, I have no clothes on.
[17957.31s -> 17959.37s]  I'm just kind of walking around in my room.
[17959.37s -> 17960.89s]  You know what I mean?
[17960.89s -> 17962.25s]  You just need to fucking know these things.
[17962.25s -> 17967.37s]  You just need to know.
[17967.37s -> 17968.25s]  You've got to know.
[17977.04s -> 17982.75s]  What the hell?
[17982.75s -> 17986.14s]  I'm staying in here.
[17986.14s -> 18000.46s]  How is, I can't fight these?
[18000.46s -> 18005.58s]  I have to pull them all individually into the room.
[18005.58s -> 18016.01s]  Why did you come too?
[18016.01s -> 18017.21s]  Oh, my God.
[18017.21s -> 18019.74s]  Are we sure?
[18019.74s -> 18019.98s]  Hold on.
[18019.98s -> 18022.78s]  Are we sure they didn't add enemies and damage?
[18027.50s -> 18030.84s]  Wait, what is he screaming in his house?
[18030.84s -> 18031.80s]  What are you talking about?
[18046.68s -> 18048.92s]  Is it like, he's doing like a bit?
[18048.92s -> 18057.02s]  I think a bat got into his house.
[18057.02s -> 18061.21s]  All right.
[18061.21s -> 18062.49s]  Give me a better spawn.
[18066.57s -> 18067.85s]  Hold on a second.
[18067.85s -> 18080.62s]  The channel's still live.
[18097.95s -> 18098.59s]  Oh, he hurt.
[18098.59s -> 18099.15s]  He hurt.
[18099.15s -> 18099.71s]  Fuck.
[18099.71s -> 18100.59s]  Yeah, I did.
[18100.59s -> 18100.99s]  I did.
[18101.71s -> 18103.23s]  That was pretty sly.
[18103.23s -> 18104.12s]  Pretty sly.
[18109.69s -> 18115.45s]  I thought he was like in danger.
[18115.45s -> 18117.29s]  And it's so funny during that whole thing.
[18117.29s -> 18120.33s]  Somebody in chat definitely wrote, oh my God, he's so bad at the game.
[18132.44s -> 18137.92s]  Dude, this guy sucks at this.
[18137.92s -> 18146.38s]  Click.
[18146.38s -> 18147.53s]  Fuck.
[18147.53s -> 18147.85s]  I clicked.
[18147.85s -> 18149.64s]  You heard it like five times.
[18149.64s -> 18150.04s]  All right.
[18150.04s -> 18158.17s]  I didn't get spawned into a terrible spot.
[18158.17s -> 18158.97s]  New hat.
[18158.97s -> 18161.52s]  This is actually really good.
[18161.52s -> 18167.32s]  Plus any stats is very good.
[18167.32s -> 18168.89s]  Okay.
[18168.89s -> 18171.21s]  I actually don't want to die because that helmet is very good.
[18176.41s -> 18187.61s]  It's better.
[18187.61s -> 18189.05s]  I don't think I've ever used this.
[18189.05s -> 18198.72s]  I just, should I do a wield?
[18198.72s -> 18211.36s]  Why not?
[18211.36s -> 18211.60s]  Click.
[18219.10s -> 18223.68s]  Pretty nice.
[18223.68s -> 18227.13s]  Okay.
[18227.13s -> 18227.69s]  Ooh.
[18227.69s -> 18229.69s]  Okay.
[18229.69s -> 18230.81s]  Oh, shit.
[18230.81s -> 18234.88s]  25 or 20.
[18234.88s -> 18236.72s]  That's plus two agility.
[18236.72s -> 18242.41s]  Oh my God.
[18242.41s -> 18244.62s]  I'm looking how fast I move now.
[18244.62s -> 18245.02s]  Jesus.
[18245.02s -> 18245.58s]  All right.
[18245.58s -> 18246.80s]  Let's keep that on.
[18246.80s -> 18265.74s]  I thought there was a player.
[18265.74s -> 18266.70s]  Beat saber mode.
[18267.26s -> 18267.90s]  Yeah, that's true.
[18269.36s -> 18270.32s]  Actually true.
[18270.32s -> 18280.96s]  This is the loot corner.
[18280.96s -> 18282.88s]  So much shit on these walls here.
[18290.20s -> 18290.84s]  Uh-oh.
[18290.84s -> 18298.86s]  He's above me.
[18298.86s -> 18321.82s]  But holy shit.
[18321.82s -> 18323.18s]  That's a pretty, I got to get out of here now.
[18323.18s -> 18336.94s]  That's a, that's a diamond.
[18336.94s -> 18340.17s]  I run fast now.
[18340.17s -> 18340.57s]  Geez.
[18342.78s -> 18346.01s]  All right.
[18346.01s -> 18347.21s]  Don't fuck this up.
[18347.21s -> 18350.32s]  I was going to find a way out because I want to keep, that's it.
[18350.32s -> 18351.68s]  That was a cool diamond.
[18351.68s -> 18358.20s]  Come on down, please.
[18358.20s -> 18359.64s]  Are you all the way up in the ceiling?
[18366.78s -> 18367.10s]  What?
[18368.43s -> 18369.39s]  Oh, you're full of shit.
[18372.46s -> 18373.18s]  Oh my God.
[18373.18s -> 18373.98s]  Just fucking run.
[18375.02s -> 18375.34s]  What?
[18375.34s -> 18377.34s]  This is, that enemy is so fucking weird.
[18377.34s -> 18378.06s]  I swear to God.
[18378.70s -> 18389.16s]  The thing is a glued to the ceiling and then comes down and goes,
[18389.16s -> 18391.00s]  dee, dee, dee.
[18391.00s -> 18398.09s]  What have you done?
[18398.09s -> 18399.45s]  Why did you bring all this shit down here?
[18403.53s -> 18405.63s]  Fucking stuck in the wall.
[18408.44s -> 18409.56s]  What the fuck, dude?
[18409.56s -> 18410.76s]  I literally couldn't even move.
[18412.54s -> 18414.14s]  I was literally stuck.
[18414.14s -> 18418.17s]  I couldn't walk.
[18418.17s -> 18421.32s]  Fuck that bug.
[18421.32s -> 18422.36s]  I was fine too.
[18431.42s -> 18432.14s]  Pain in the ass.
[18449.96s -> 18452.54s]  Good night, Irene.
[18452.54s -> 18453.66s]  I jumped into it.
[18453.66s -> 18466.57s]  At least you're not losing stuff.
[18466.57s -> 18469.74s]  The thing, well, he kind of just said he had the same idea
[18469.74s -> 18470.62s]  where he was just like, you know what?
[18470.62s -> 18471.34s]  We're just dead.
[18471.34s -> 18472.54s]  So one of us is going to die.
[18473.26s -> 18473.82s]  You know what?
[18473.82s -> 18474.94s]  I would have rather he killed me.
[18475.68s -> 18478.56s]  He knew too that one of us was going to get embarrassed
[18478.56s -> 18479.76s]  getting stuck in that corner.
[18479.76s -> 18480.88s]  And he didn't want it to be him.
[18480.88s -> 18483.08s]  So he got the easy way out.
[18489.42s -> 18490.54s]  You married into it.
[18490.54s -> 18529.21s]  It is sore though.
[18529.21s -> 18529.53s]  Okay.
[18533.68s -> 18536.40s]  Somebody asked, why do the skeletons have blood?
[18536.40s -> 18537.28s]  Bone marrow.
[18537.28s -> 18538.40s]  You know where your blood comes from?
[18554.83s -> 18559.55s]  Bone marrow.
[18559.55s -> 18562.27s]  I feel like this is going to be a never-ending spider thing
[18562.27s -> 18567.42s]  because my weapon is not.
[18567.42s -> 18568.78s]  You're still living.
[18568.78s -> 18570.46s]  Why are you still among the living?
[18570.46s -> 18570.78s]  All right.
[18570.78s -> 18571.98s]  Just don't go that way.
[18571.98s -> 18576.73s]  Your blood comes from your heart.
[18581.92s -> 18589.05s]  Your, what are you talking about?
[18589.05s -> 18592.28s]  Your heart pumps it.
[18600.20s -> 18601.40s]  It actually comes from marrow.
[18611.76s -> 18613.76s]  Blood cells are made in the bone marrow.
[18613.76s -> 18615.60s]  The bone marrow is the soft spongy material
[18615.60s -> 18616.72s]  in the center of the bones.
[18616.72s -> 18619.77s]  It produces about 95% of the body's blood cells.
[18619.77s -> 18622.49s]  Most of the adult body's bone marrow is in the pelvic bones.
[18622.49s -> 18624.83s]  Breast bone and the bones of the spine.
[18624.83s -> 18626.19s]  Time that person out for 10 minutes.
[18626.19s -> 18655.08s]  Somebody's coming over that way.
[18655.08s -> 18657.77s]  This is going to get bad, isn't it?
[18660.64s -> 18662.81s]  He hears all this, too.
[18662.81s -> 18664.17s]  He's probably listening to the door.
[18672.78s -> 18673.10s]  Yeah.
[18678.22s -> 18679.02s]  Are we cool?
[18679.02s -> 18692.40s]  All right, you're cool.
[18692.40s -> 18707.84s]  I'm not going to kill you.
[18707.84s -> 18709.32s]  I'm just following you.
[18709.32s -> 18724.28s]  That sounds weird, but pretend to be fighting me.
[18724.28s -> 18725.32s]  Pretend to be fighting me.
[18725.32s -> 18729.93s]  Get back here.
[18729.93s -> 18733.52s]  Yeah, pretend to be fighting me so we can trick somebody.
[18737.21s -> 18739.15s]  Don't even think about it.
[18739.71s -> 18740.67s]  Oh, no.
[18740.67s -> 18742.73s]  Uh-oh.
[18742.73s -> 18748.76s]  Ooh, it didn't work.
[18748.76s -> 18749.80s]  I thought someone was coming through the door.
[18753.13s -> 18757.00s]  And then get him.
[18757.00s -> 18759.21s]  Well, that was fun for a minute.
[18759.21s -> 18760.41s]  We have to be in this room.
[18760.41s -> 18761.21s]  This is awful.
[18763.92s -> 18764.88s]  I'm going to go around.
[18764.88s -> 18766.24s]  I don't want to deal with that side.
[18766.32s -> 18768.56s]  I don't have any items.
[18768.56s -> 18769.52s]  What the fuck have I been doing?
[18817.87s -> 18818.27s]  All right.
[18818.27s -> 18819.23s]  I just need to find a portal.
[18819.23s -> 18820.67s]  I really didn't do anything this round.
[18820.67s -> 18822.35s]  I kind of just walked around in a circle.
[18822.35s -> 18826.04s]  So many concentrated enemies right there.
[18826.04s -> 18832.52s]  I need to at least get some loot or something.
[18832.52s -> 18834.44s]  There are so many people that are left, too.
[18834.44s -> 18849.23s]  Still aggro'd on him.
[18853.31s -> 18854.03s]  Nice one.
[18854.03s -> 18863.40s]  Oh, shit.
[18878.43s -> 18879.07s]  All right.
[18879.07s -> 18880.56s]  Nice job.
[18880.56s -> 18892.83s]  All right.
[18892.83s -> 18893.31s]  We got to...
[18893.31s -> 18894.43s]  I mean, we don't have to get to...
[18894.43s -> 18896.65s]  Ooh.
[18896.65s -> 18897.98s]  All right.
[18897.98s -> 18898.94s]  What do we got?
[18898.94s -> 18901.28s]  Something good?
[18917.63s -> 18920.43s]  May your journeys be long, your ale fresh,
[18921.07s -> 18924.51s]  and your carrots crunchy, and your stew hot,
[18924.51s -> 18930.56s]  and your goblins easy to slay, and your friends plentiful.
[18930.56s -> 18930.88s]  All right.
[18930.88s -> 18931.44s]  You go.
[18931.44s -> 18933.85s]  You go.
[18933.85s -> 18934.97s]  I have nothing.
[18934.97s -> 18936.41s]  I have literally have no reason to go through that.
[18945.34s -> 18946.70s]  Like, I really just don't.
[18946.70s -> 18948.54s]  I mean, 10 gold maybe.
[18948.54s -> 18955.96s]  There's a lot of people left for how tiny this circle is.
[18955.96s -> 18969.10s]  I'm the last one.
[18969.88s -> 18974.36s]  Oh, no, I'm not.
[18974.36s -> 18975.88s]  There's like three people left.
[18975.88s -> 18988.32s]  I just wanted a portal.
[18988.32s -> 18989.63s]  Oh, wait.
[18989.63s -> 18990.35s]  I heard one.
[18990.35s -> 18997.53s]  I think it was above, though.
[18997.53s -> 18998.57s]  Yeah, it was above.
[18998.57s -> 19000.96s]  That's OK.
[19000.96s -> 19002.64s]  Yeah, I should have just dropped all my shit,
[19002.64s -> 19014.96s]  and he could have just taken it.
[19014.96s -> 19015.84s]  The next adventurer.
[19034.99s -> 19037.42s]  You can make it if you run.
[19039.26s -> 19041.52s]  If there was something good in that treasure chest,
[19041.52s -> 19054.73s]  then I'm glad somebody got it.
[19054.73s -> 19058.25s]  My last message from Stirr, like 15 minutes ago,
[19058.25s -> 19060.33s]  kind of disrespectful to ask me to end stream.
[19060.33s -> 19061.21s]  It wasn't even bad.
[19061.85s -> 19064.67s]  Hello?
[19078.22s -> 19089.68s]  Well, he's such a shit.
[19089.68s -> 19090.56s]  Oh, hi.
[19090.56s -> 19091.44s]  10 enemies.
[19091.44s -> 19115.79s]  There really are so many.
[19115.79s -> 19130.11s]  You weren't even close.
[19130.11s -> 19132.81s]  That's a pretty decent amount of money to start with.
[19135.10s -> 19136.94s]  I'm going to try to just get out of here.
[19136.94s -> 19158.24s]  Oh, a diamond.
[19158.24s -> 19160.97s]  OK.
[19160.97s -> 19164.89s]  Oh, if only I had somebody to guide me.
[19164.89s -> 19169.24s]  If only somebody was around to show me the way.
[19170.19s -> 19179.15s]  Oh, oh, stuck down here in a dungeon.
[19179.15s -> 19181.87s]  If only there was an adventurer that could help me.
[19186.43s -> 19189.13s]  The promise of jewels was not enough.
[19190.94s -> 19194.49s]  Oh, if only there was an adventurer that could come
[19194.49s -> 19196.49s]  and help me and accept my quest.
[19202.36s -> 19217.50s]  Oh, thank you for accepting my quest.
[19218.32s -> 19220.40s]  Oh, it's been very cold down here.
[19222.11s -> 19222.91s]  Where are you?
[19222.91s -> 19223.71s]  Where are you off to?
[19224.99s -> 19225.95s]  Oh, if only there.
[19225.95s -> 19226.35s]  All right.
[19226.35s -> 19226.99s]  We need to.
[19226.99s -> 19227.95s]  There's too many people.
[19230.99s -> 19237.82s]  Oh, dear.
[19237.82s -> 19240.06s]  The dungeon is so strong, brothers.
[19240.06s -> 19241.50s]  So dark down here.
[19242.65s -> 19245.71s]  If anyone were to lead me to a portal,
[19245.71s -> 19249.47s]  I have a diamond that they will have if they complete my quest.
[19250.51s -> 19252.91s]  I look in the door this way.
[19252.91s -> 19257.58s]  Hurry hurrying behind you.
[19265.92s -> 19266.72s]  Is that acid?
[19267.61s -> 19268.33s]  No, it's safe.
[19268.33s -> 19268.81s]  It is safe.
[19269.53s -> 19271.53s]  See, it's green jello.
[19277.36s -> 19278.56s]  So much mountain dew.
[19282.09s -> 19282.73s]  All right.
[19282.73s -> 19283.37s]  All right.
[19283.37s -> 19283.85s]  All right.
[19284.57s -> 19287.93s]  Oh, the poison, the poison stings.
[19287.93s -> 19290.57s]  Does anyone have a close the door behind us?
[19292.01s -> 19293.45s]  We're fucking dead.
[19294.01s -> 19295.37s]  There's no way we're getting through this.
[19296.01s -> 19296.81s]  Oh, my God.
[19296.81s -> 19297.61s]  That's so slow.
[19299.84s -> 19300.40s]  Oh, shit.
[19300.40s -> 19301.28s]  I almost closed the door.
[19304.52s -> 19306.36s]  Would any of you happen to have a healing pot?
[19306.36s -> 19307.56s]  Watch out behind you.
[19307.56s -> 19312.22s]  There's a mummy and a bug and a snake.
[19320.70s -> 19324.22s]  Please, if you get it out alive, I have a diamond on me.
[19324.22s -> 19325.02s]  Even though you failed.
[19330.91s -> 19332.03s]  There's so many things.
[19333.23s -> 19337.80s]  We were just being followed by 25 enemies.
[19337.80s -> 19348.86s]  I want to be an escort quest for somebody so bad.
[19348.86s -> 19351.26s]  Oh, I would be willing to give anybody all of my items
[19351.26s -> 19353.18s]  that they would escort me to a portal.
[19353.18s -> 19354.70s]  Find me.
[19354.70s -> 19355.66s]  Find me if you could.
[19356.22s -> 19358.44s]  Okay.
[19358.44s -> 19359.48s]  You're mean.
[19359.48s -> 19374.56s]  Okay.
[19374.56s -> 19376.56s]  I need to find like a blue diamond
[19376.56s -> 19378.72s]  and then just be a quest for somebody.
[19378.72s -> 19380.27s]  I'm into that right now.
[19380.27s -> 19385.00s]  I'm down on the southern end of the map.
[19385.00s -> 19388.32s]  I don't know how far my voice travels.
[19413.02s -> 19415.90s]  Next time, I'm just going to bring like 15 bandages
[19415.90s -> 19419.56s]  and like 25 potions in the corner.
[19420.75s -> 19421.71s]  Oh, my goodness.
[19421.71s -> 19422.67s]  These fucking enemies.
[19424.83s -> 19425.39s]  Jesus.
[19426.27s -> 19440.51s]  There we go.
[19440.51s -> 19442.56s]  A magical amulet.
[19443.20s -> 19454.78s]  Oh, my God.
[19454.78s -> 19455.82s]  There's so much gear over here.
[19455.82s -> 19456.30s]  I can do it.
[19457.10s -> 19457.98s]  Just don't die.
[19457.98s -> 19459.18s]  Look at all this shit over here.
[19459.18s -> 19465.12s]  What are you doing?
[19465.12s -> 19467.29s]  What the hell is this person?
[19467.29s -> 19467.85s]  What are you doing?
[19468.86s -> 19470.38s]  What were you doing?
[19470.38s -> 19474.38s]  Look at all these.
[19474.38s -> 19475.10s]  Oh, my God.
[19475.10s -> 19476.78s]  This is such a quest reward.
[19476.78s -> 19487.60s]  I need an adventurer to help me get out of the dungeon.
[19488.80s -> 19489.52s]  I have gold.
[19490.08s -> 19492.22s]  I have trinkets.
[19493.82s -> 19495.66s]  I need some help to get out of the dungeon.
[19495.66s -> 19497.18s]  I have plenty of goods.
[19498.94s -> 19500.30s]  Is there anyone out there?
[19500.30s -> 19508.32s]  Can anybody hear me?
[19508.32s -> 19510.00s]  I need an escort out of the dungeon.
[19516.86s -> 19517.34s]  Anyone?
[19518.33s -> 19519.85s]  Can anyone hear me?
[19519.85s -> 19527.32s]  I need an escort out of the dungeon, please.
[19527.96s -> 19530.14s]  I have gold.
[19533.56s -> 19534.68s]  I have treasure.
[19534.68s -> 19549.39s]  If anyone's out there, I have gold.
[19549.39s -> 19550.59s]  I have jewels.
[19550.59s -> 19554.43s]  I need an escort out of the dungeon, please.
[19562.43s -> 19564.17s]  Fuck these bugs.
[19564.17s -> 19565.29s]  They're the worst.
[19565.29s -> 19580.00s]  I'm on the lower level.
[19580.00s -> 19592.48s]  There's no one here to help me.
[19592.48s -> 19606.68s]  Is there anyone that will help me?
[19606.68s -> 19612.67s]  Adventurer, adventurer, I need help.
[19612.67s -> 19615.23s]  Oh, there's a lot of fucking spiders here.
[19617.76s -> 19622.84s]  Oh, adventurer.
[19622.84s -> 19623.24s]  If you...
[19623.24s -> 19624.28s]  That's a fucking enemy.
[19625.42s -> 19642.11s]  I just saw the shield.
[19642.11s -> 19642.67s]  All right, we're going...
[19642.67s -> 19648.16s]  We're doing a real one this time.
[19648.16s -> 19649.84s]  Well, howdy there.
[19649.84s -> 19651.72s]  I need an escort out of the dungeon.
[19651.72s -> 19653.16s]  I will pay gold and jewels.
[19653.16s -> 19654.12s]  If you can please find me,
[19654.12s -> 19655.88s]  I will go to the southern end of the map.
[19655.88s -> 19657.79s]  Please, please.
[19657.79s -> 19658.67s]  Okay.
[19658.67s -> 19662.70s]  That was such a reluctant okay.
[19662.70s -> 19664.38s]  That was the most reluctant okay I've ever heard.
[19665.77s -> 19666.25s]  That was like...
[19671.44s -> 19673.12s]  I'm going to die on my way over there.
[19673.12s -> 19675.96s]  I hope he finds my body.
[19675.96s -> 19679.95s]  Quest accepted.
[19679.95s -> 19682.06s]  All right, I got to get to the southern end of the map.
[19687.45s -> 19687.77s]  Please.
[19688.64s -> 19689.52s]  Look at that.
[19689.52s -> 19690.64s]  Oh, I can't believe it.
[19690.64s -> 19691.92s]  I found you pretty fast.
[19691.92s -> 19694.97s]  Will you accept my quest?
[19694.97s -> 19695.37s]  Sure.
[19695.93s -> 19696.57s]  Okay.
[19696.57s -> 19698.25s]  I don't know very much about the dungeon.
[19698.25s -> 19701.45s]  All I know is that I don't want to be down here.
[19701.45s -> 19703.07s]  It smells.
[19703.07s -> 19704.51s]  Yeah, yeah, that's fair.
[19704.51s -> 19707.64s]  I see you're a wizard.
[19708.83s -> 19709.47s]  Very helpful.
[19710.19s -> 19710.69s]  Claire.
[19711.39s -> 19712.59s]  Oh, yeah.
[19715.55s -> 19716.03s]  Careful.
[19716.67s -> 19718.52s]  This dungeon is known to have all kinds...
[19718.52s -> 19719.64s]  Adventurer!
[19719.64s -> 19720.52s]  There are goblins!
[19721.66s -> 19722.22s]  Adventurer!
[19722.94s -> 19728.33s]  I'm back, I'm back.
[19728.33s -> 19728.89s]  Careful.
[19729.61s -> 19732.04s]  With the great power of
[19732.84s -> 19734.52s]  Phineas Davidson.
[19734.52s -> 19735.32s]  I smacked you.
[19739.72s -> 19740.60s]  Oh my goodness.
[19744.54s -> 19745.02s]  Behind you.
[19745.82s -> 19751.08s]  Look out!
[19751.64s -> 19758.38s]  Not swinging.
[19770.33s -> 19773.69s]  These caves have so many scary things in them.
[19774.97s -> 19779.68s]  When I was younger, I used to explore here.
[19779.68s -> 19785.92s]  Onward!
[19785.92s -> 19787.20s]  Well, that way seems dangerous.
[19788.19s -> 19788.67s]  It does.
[19790.38s -> 19797.82s]  I would say we should probably go south.
[19797.82s -> 19800.62s]  I remember when I was in the poison swamp one time.
[19803.02s -> 19807.74s]  The amount of damage and disease it causes.
[19807.74s -> 19811.42s]  Onward with sick in a moment's notice being down here.
[19812.06s -> 19814.88s]  Truly a disgusting...
[19814.88s -> 19815.44s]  Adventurer!
[19816.08s -> 19817.04s]  Goblins are afoot!
[19827.96s -> 19828.68s]  Don't let him run!
[19835.00s -> 19835.72s]  Poisonous.
[19836.60s -> 19838.20s]  Very, very disgusting.
[19838.20s -> 19841.08s]  Anyone would take five points of damage if they walked down here.
[19844.78s -> 19845.42s]  Adventurer!
[19845.42s -> 19845.98s]  Goblins!
[19869.21s -> 19870.41s]  Hold on, I know...
[19875.34s -> 19878.97s]  These halls are full of all kinds of dangerous things.
[19881.26s -> 19883.52s]  Ah, that feels better.
[19887.48s -> 19889.80s]  Ah, that feels better.
[19890.36s -> 19894.62s]  Oh my god, is it you?
[19894.62s -> 19895.66s]  That feels better.
[19900.04s -> 19900.44s]  All right.
[19904.01s -> 19904.81s]  We are safe here.
[19906.33s -> 19907.80s]  The dungeon was built...
[19907.80s -> 19909.16s]  I would like to participate...
[19909.16s -> 19911.88s]  ...back in 1500 BC.
[19912.44s -> 19916.40s]  It stood for many years.
[19917.90s -> 19922.91s]  Poison is actually dragon's breath, if you didn't know.
[19922.91s -> 19928.80s]  Five million years ago, the dragon Allora died down here.
[19928.80s -> 19935.00s]  And their spit is what causes most of the poison, if you didn't know.
[19935.00s -> 19936.04s]  Adventurer!
[19936.04s -> 19936.52s]  Goblins!
[19958.52s -> 19961.90s]  Oh, I'm about to die.
[19961.90s -> 19962.62s]  A portal!
[19963.50s -> 19964.46s]  There's the portal!
[19972.32s -> 19972.96s]  The portal!
[19973.52s -> 19979.16s]  There's the portal!
[19979.16s -> 19980.44s]  Want to leave?
[19980.44s -> 19989.32s]  The dragon breathed four thousand percent five million years ago.
[19990.91s -> 19992.51s]  I thank you for helping me.
[19994.11s -> 19996.51s]  Listen, don't forget about me, general.
[19996.51s -> 19997.23s]  Here is the...
[19997.23s -> 19998.27s]  Don't forget about me.
[19998.27s -> 20000.75s]  Here's your shitty reward for me.
[20002.03s -> 20002.51s]  He...
[20002.51s -> 20003.15s]  He took it.
[20004.14s -> 20009.15s]  Here's your shitty reward for your level one quest.
[20009.15s -> 20009.55s]  Thank you.
[20009.55s -> 20010.19s]  Thank you.
[20010.19s -> 20011.63s]  I will go in the portal now.
[20014.38s -> 20015.02s]  He took it.
[20027.53s -> 20028.97s]  Hey, there's people here.
[20029.53s -> 20030.33s]  Adventurer!
[20030.33s -> 20030.81s]  Goblins!
[20036.09s -> 20038.57s]  Use the strength of a thousand sons!
[20042.86s -> 20044.30s]  Here, take this, Adventurer.
[20045.02s -> 20045.74s]  You could use it.
[20046.38s -> 20047.66s]  Oh, shit, he escaped.
[20069.13s -> 20084.14s]  The dragon five thousand years ago was the shittiest NPC of any fucking game ever.
[20084.14s -> 20093.88s]  Hey, they played along, it was fun.
[20093.88s -> 20095.00s]  All right, let's do a real one.
[20095.00s -> 20109.28s]  Oh, the dragon...
[20110.17s -> 20111.05s]  Alloro?
[20111.05s -> 20112.65s]  I don't even know what the dragon's name was.
[20112.65s -> 20140.89s]  General, you could have donated those seventy five...
[20140.89s -> 20141.37s]  Do you mean...
[20141.37s -> 20142.65s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[20142.65s -> 20145.05s]  I just want to make sure I'm very clear of what you're asking me.
[20145.05s -> 20150.35s]  Are you talking about the family guy money from ten years ago?
[20152.76s -> 20177.87s]  Why are you bringing that up right now?
[20177.87s -> 20178.43s]  Anything?
[20178.43s -> 20179.07s]  Anything?
[20179.07s -> 20180.11s]  Okay, easy.
[20180.11s -> 20188.83s]  Good start.
[20188.83s -> 20189.39s]  Let's go.
[20189.39s -> 20195.13s]  I ain't going that way.
[20195.13s -> 20198.80s]  Actually, did I just get one?
[20198.80s -> 20199.77s]  Yeah, I did.
[20199.77s -> 20228.09s]  Okay, don't screw this up.
[20228.09s -> 20245.47s]  It's really easy to screw it up in solo.
[20245.47s -> 20246.91s]  You always think it's safe and it never is.
[20260.97s -> 20262.06s]  Okay, come on.
[20262.06s -> 20264.14s]  Through the door and then I'm going to close it.
[20264.14s -> 20268.09s]  That's how you do it.
[20268.09s -> 20288.52s]  Cool.
[20288.52s -> 20289.24s]  There we go.
[20289.80s -> 20299.84s]  That's actually really good for a green.
[20299.84s -> 20300.80s]  Oh, shit.
[20300.80s -> 20306.73s]  I didn't want to press that button and I did.
[20306.73s -> 20307.85s]  I didn't mean to.
[20307.85s -> 20308.73s]  Oh, don't panic.
[20308.73s -> 20309.45s]  Just fucking go.
[20309.45s -> 20310.33s]  I fucked it up.
[20310.33s -> 20314.60s]  I was so afraid of going back into this room.
[20330.08s -> 20336.25s]  This is not going like terribly.
[20336.97s -> 20343.88s]  This weapon is really good, though, for a green.
[20343.88s -> 20347.69s]  I don't want to lose it.
[20347.69s -> 20348.41s]  Fuck.
[20348.41s -> 20357.37s]  Open, open, open, open, open, open, open.
[20359.93s -> 20370.19s]  Somebody was already here.
[20370.19s -> 20380.36s]  Oh, my God.
[20380.36s -> 20381.16s]  Oh, thank God.
[20381.16s -> 20399.69s]  A lot of stuff running down here.
[20399.69s -> 20400.97s]  I got to look for a portal.
[20400.97s -> 20410.32s]  Oh, yeah.
[20410.32s -> 20410.96s]  Strength, too.
[20410.96s -> 20421.71s]  These have stats.
[20421.71s -> 20423.23s]  Six, agility.
[20423.23s -> 20425.10s]  Where are you?
[20425.10s -> 20425.58s]  You?
[20425.58s -> 20426.38s]  Oh, he's gone.
[20426.38s -> 20445.56s]  Oh, somebody closed it.
[20445.56s -> 20446.36s]  You got a shield.
[20446.36s -> 20474.54s]  I don't want to fuck with that.
[20474.54s -> 20475.58s]  You can have half.
[20475.58s -> 20476.32s]  That's how it works.
[20476.32s -> 20477.12s]  You can have half.
[20477.12s -> 20480.88s]  I was hoping he was going to just attack me.
[20480.88s -> 20482.32s]  I just took way more than half.
[20482.32s -> 20502.54s]  No, this is yours.
[20502.54s -> 20503.42s]  I took way more than that.
[20506.65s -> 20513.28s]  Okay.
[20513.28s -> 20514.64s]  Traitor Andy.
[20514.64s -> 20524.22s]  What is going on?
[20524.22s -> 20525.82s]  Oh, I thought he was swinging at me.
[20525.82s -> 20527.58s]  Sorry, be safe.
[20527.58s -> 20533.44s]  I don't have much, but whatever.
[20533.44s -> 20534.72s]  I do want to get out with this weapon.
[20534.72s -> 20544.00s]  Nice work.
[20544.00s -> 20548.64s]  Shit.
[20548.64s -> 20551.48s]  It's too dark.
[20551.48s -> 20558.32s]  Oh, boy.
[20558.32s -> 20559.04s]  This is very bad.
[20567.84s -> 20568.32s]  Stuck.
[20568.32s -> 20571.63s]  I'm stuck.
[20571.63s -> 20572.67s]  Oh, fuck.
[20572.67s -> 20573.47s]  Look out.
[20573.47s -> 20574.35s]  Be careful.
[20574.35s -> 20577.16s]  I'm going to bleed to death, aren't I?
[20577.16s -> 20578.12s]  Oh, they're right here.
[20582.83s -> 20584.12s]  Be careful.
[20584.12s -> 20585.40s]  It's not safe.
[20585.40s -> 20593.34s]  You literally saved my life.
[20593.34s -> 20601.47s]  Before we leave, I'm going to give you a trinket.
[20601.47s -> 20619.24s]  Is this the last portal?
[20619.24s -> 20645.02s]  Oh, I don't know if there's any more.
[20645.02s -> 20647.95s]  There's one more.
[20647.95s -> 20649.55s]  It'll spawn when it's closing again.
[20649.55s -> 20651.64s]  Okay.
[20651.64s -> 20666.30s]  Good to know.
[20666.30s -> 20667.42s]  Shit, there's no portal in here.
[20667.42s -> 20668.22s]  This is so annoying.
[20668.22s -> 20669.10s]  It's probably up.
[20669.10s -> 20670.75s]  That's so annoying.
[20670.75s -> 20671.71s]  The portal's probably up.
[20671.71s -> 20686.24s]  Okay, cool.
[20686.24s -> 20688.40s]  I mean, didn't really get very much, but I did.
[20688.40s -> 20689.68s]  I actually really wanted to hold on to this.
[20689.68s -> 20690.48s]  This thing's pretty good.
[20690.48s -> 20708.22s]  I feel like I haven't traded anything to the merchant in like an hour and a half.
[20708.22s -> 20709.02s]  No, no, no, no.
[20709.02s -> 20714.88s]  Keep those two.
[20714.88s -> 20726.25s]  Get rid of these.
[20726.25s -> 20727.29s]  And one strength.
[20730.03s -> 20732.48s]  I mean, that's kind of good, though.
[20732.48s -> 20739.96s]  Only three gold.
[20739.96s -> 20740.76s]  That's kind of terrible.
[20751.16s -> 20759.50s]  Let me get rid of some of this silver.
[20759.50s -> 20772.75s]  I know if people are saying to buy these, but I like having...
[20773.31s -> 20773.87s]  Not yet.
[20773.87s -> 20780.16s]  I don't need it yet.
[20780.16s -> 20791.58s]  Once this comes down to halfway, I'm ready to show this off to anybody,
[20791.58s -> 20792.86s]  but I'm afraid to use it.
[20792.86s -> 20799.66s]  I'm still holding this.
[20805.60s -> 20807.44s]  I'm going to do it again.
[20807.44s -> 20809.68s]  I have gear.
[20809.68s -> 20822.43s]  Actually, I'm going to buy some potions and stuff.
[20822.43s -> 20823.15s]  Bandages.
[20823.15s -> 20846.04s]  There's four portals now.
[20846.04s -> 20848.28s]  That's good.
[20848.28s -> 20850.41s]  That's actually really good.
[20850.41s -> 20867.87s]  That went down.
[20890.33s -> 20891.13s]  No, really?
[20891.69s -> 20896.56s]  Oh, don't even.
[20904.99s -> 20908.49s]  Trying to hit them both.
[20908.49s -> 20909.13s]  What?
[20909.13s -> 20914.30s]  Well, glad I brought these.
[20914.30s -> 20926.22s]  I did it.
[20926.22s -> 20927.90s]  I killed the goblin king.
[20928.70s -> 20929.34s]  I've done it.
[20929.34s -> 20930.46s]  That wasn't the king.
[20931.18s -> 20931.98s]  That's a lackey.
[20931.98s -> 20938.96s]  You don't fucking know what you're doing.
[20938.96s -> 20940.48s]  No, I killed the king.
[20941.04s -> 20942.08s]  I killed the king earlier.
[20942.08s -> 20942.48s]  It was me.
[20946.28s -> 20947.08s]  I killed the king earlier.
[20947.08s -> 20947.64s]  You didn't kill the king.
[20947.64s -> 20948.28s]  It was me that did it.
[20949.63s -> 20955.42s]  Here, take this.
[20955.42s -> 20963.13s]  Let's have fire.
[20963.13s -> 20964.65s]  Can you just give it to me?
[20964.65s -> 20971.23s]  On the ground, right here.
[20971.23s -> 20973.71s]  Yeah, worth a bunch of money.
[20973.71s -> 20987.36s]  I'm a cleric, so if you ever need patching up, little, you know...
[20991.08s -> 20991.80s]  I'm a loner.
[20993.16s -> 20996.44s]  I'm a loner, and I don't really have a party or anything.
[20996.44s -> 21000.00s]  So it's really nice to meet you, though.
[21000.08s -> 21001.20s]  Like, what kind of party?
[21001.20s -> 21002.80s]  Are you throwing, like, a birthday party?
[21002.80s -> 21004.32s]  Or it's like a...
[21004.32s -> 21004.88s]  Wait.
[21004.88s -> 21005.36s]  Hey, now.
[21010.36s -> 21017.37s]  We should group up.
[21017.37s -> 21029.64s]  Are you good on here?
[21034.80s -> 21036.72s]  I'm supposed to stand there, get poked again.
[21037.28s -> 21038.56s]  Right into the ear.
[21038.56s -> 21039.28s]  Do you have any potions?
[21039.28s -> 21039.92s]  Are you good on potions?
[21041.82s -> 21043.10s]  I got too many potions.
[21043.74s -> 21046.62s]  I also got this wine bottle.
[21048.27s -> 21051.15s]  We could have a little cabaret dinner.
[21052.11s -> 21054.14s]  That looks dangerous.
[21057.02s -> 21058.94s]  The hole is not dangerous.
[21058.94s -> 21061.02s]  You almost got poked in the ear again.
[21061.02s -> 21062.06s]  Yeah, it was close, though.
[21067.95s -> 21073.21s]  You got a little beetle.
[21076.24s -> 21078.08s]  Calgimus, forcimus.
[21078.88s -> 21089.76s]  Watch out.
[21089.76s -> 21094.22s]  Oh, he's dead.
[21094.22s -> 21095.58s]  No, wait, how did he die?
[21096.30s -> 21096.94s]  Oh, no.
[21098.94s -> 21099.82s]  He stopped talking.
[21100.38s -> 21100.86s]  I was about to...
[21100.86s -> 21101.66s]  I was going to do, like, a...
[21101.66s -> 21103.18s]  I was going to do a face turn.
[21104.70s -> 21105.50s]  Oh, no.
[21105.50s -> 21108.06s]  I was going to do a face turn and beetle...
[21108.06s -> 21118.19s]  Oh, God.
[21120.46s -> 21121.02s]  I hit him.
[21121.02s -> 21123.45s]  No, I didn't.
[21123.45s -> 21126.01s]  I was just trying to be, like, the weird guy in the dungeon.
[21129.15s -> 21130.35s]  Get me off voice chat.
[21130.35s -> 21132.51s]  I can't play the game with this proximity chat.
[21145.96s -> 21147.39s]  Turn it off.
[21148.35s -> 21149.31s]  I have to stop this.
[21149.31s -> 21166.86s]  Just closing the door and then he opens the door.
[21166.86s -> 21188.28s]  I'm just standing there at the end of the hallway.
[21188.28s -> 21189.88s]  One normal round.
[21189.88s -> 21192.67s]  Turn it back on.
[21192.67s -> 21209.98s]  I'm not going to do an L-M-O-R-P.
[21209.98s -> 21213.08s]  You're trying to, like, make 10,000 people leave.
[21213.08s -> 21234.46s]  God, how did that not reach?
[21234.46s -> 21236.28s]  Actually, thanks.
[21236.28s -> 21236.92s]  That helped.
[21247.23s -> 21248.35s]  Why am I so slow?
[21248.35s -> 21250.49s]  Oh, that's a debuff that I'm...
[21250.49s -> 21250.73s]  Okay.
[21250.73s -> 21251.05s]  Oh, no.
[21251.05s -> 21259.15s]  You're going to heal, aren't you?
[21259.15s -> 21260.43s]  Cool, but I can't use it.
[21260.43s -> 21287.12s]  Somebody's coming.
[21289.74s -> 21293.47s]  Crouch.
[21293.47s -> 21295.15s]  RP where you pretend to be really good.
[21295.15s -> 21296.46s]  I can try that.
[21313.12s -> 21313.44s]  I'm sorry.
[21313.44s -> 21314.72s]  I probably just woke somebody up.
[21314.72s -> 21357.20s]  Trying to, like, freak that person out.
[21357.20s -> 21358.72s]  I just lost a fucking torch.
[21358.72s -> 21359.44s]  That's all that happened.
[21376.46s -> 21377.85s]  Not...
[21377.85s -> 21378.57s]  No.
[21378.57s -> 21379.45s]  This room is awful.
[21389.45s -> 21391.08s]  I'm going to go up.
[21391.08s -> 21405.95s]  God damn it.
[21405.95s -> 21406.51s]  It's junk.
[21408.48s -> 21422.52s]  SpongeBob RP.
[21422.52s -> 21425.79s]  Look at all this crap.
[21425.79s -> 21426.59s]  I have to get out of here.
[21459.16s -> 21459.96s]  Shit.
[21459.96s -> 21464.33s]  How...
[21464.33s -> 21464.65s]  I'm...
[21464.65s -> 21465.45s]  How do I get up there?
[21469.24s -> 21470.70s]  I don't...
[21470.70s -> 21472.83s]  Can I get up there?
[21472.83s -> 21475.76s]  I think I'm, like, trapped.
[21506.20s -> 21510.41s]  I'm going to die.
[21515.79s -> 21526.44s]  That was pretty close.
[21526.44s -> 21536.48s]  Any scraps?
[21536.48s -> 21544.35s]  Oh, my goodness.
[21544.35s -> 21555.40s]  Am I invisible?
[21555.40s -> 21560.43s]  Where the fuck are the eggs at?
[21561.15s -> 21562.25s]  I don't know.
[21563.45s -> 21563.77s]  Ow.
[21564.65s -> 21567.95s]  Did you just get caved in on?
[21571.44s -> 21571.68s]  What?
[21575.37s -> 21577.60s]  You got it.
[21583.52s -> 21583.84s]  Yeah.
[21584.48s -> 21585.36s]  I think there's one more.
[21612.83s -> 21616.17s]  What the fuck was that?
[21620.94s -> 21621.90s]  Was that Elmo?
[21621.90s -> 21622.88s]  That was weird.
[21622.88s -> 21628.92s]  Who is doing that?
[21628.92s -> 21629.32s]  Shut up.
[21634.48s -> 21638.40s]  Is it anybody else?
[21638.40s -> 21640.83s]  No, it's just this guy.
[21644.25s -> 21645.61s]  It had to be me.
[21645.61s -> 21652.97s]  There's nobody else in the lobby.
[21652.97s -> 21653.77s]  It had to be me.
[21653.77s -> 21663.18s]  I thought there was two or three people left.
[21663.18s -> 21664.46s]  You watch what...
[21664.46s -> 21665.90s]  You have to watch him.
[21665.90s -> 21672.91s]  Let's see if he can escape.
[21672.91s -> 21680.75s]  I wish you luck.
[21680.75s -> 21686.83s]  Is that...
[21686.83s -> 21687.55s]  Ooh.
[21687.55s -> 21695.84s]  I think you're going to get out.
[21695.84s -> 21696.64s]  Yeah.
[21696.64s -> 21697.28s]  There we go.
[21697.28s -> 21698.70s]  It's all good.
[21698.70s -> 21711.12s]  Eugene.
[21711.12s -> 21712.64s]  I'm going to throw a little bit of a curve ball here.
[21712.64s -> 21714.00s]  I'm going to do one more round.
[21714.96s -> 21715.36s]  Yeah, look.
[21715.36s -> 21717.53s]  I didn't really get anything.
[21717.53s -> 21718.57s]  I'm going to try a different class.
[21718.57s -> 21720.12s]  I'm going to go level one.
[21720.12s -> 21727.87s]  Not that it matters, but that's the wrong button.
[21727.87s -> 21749.23s]  You can sell from the stash?
[21749.23s -> 21753.36s]  Really?
[21753.36s -> 21754.72s]  Will I play the Metroid remaster?
[21754.72s -> 21756.80s]  I never played Metroid Prime.
[21756.80s -> 21765.16s]  It always looked interesting, but this was something I never really grasped.
[21765.16s -> 21768.57s]  For me, the Wii was always...
[21769.45s -> 21774.33s]  All the FPSs that were on Wii were so good.
[21774.33s -> 21777.31s]  Resident Evil 4 for the Wii is my favorite version of that game.
[21777.31s -> 21778.75s]  Obviously before it came to PC.
[21778.75s -> 21779.31s]  But even...
[21779.31s -> 21779.71s]  I don't know.
[21779.71s -> 21783.93s]  Even still, I really liked it on Wii.
[21783.93s -> 21785.69s]  It was really fun to aim with it.
[21786.09s -> 21787.05s]  Seemed pretty responsive.
[21796.96s -> 21797.20s]  All right.
[21797.20s -> 21797.76s]  Let me do...
[21798.56s -> 21800.96s]  Let me do one in the normal place.
[21800.96s -> 21805.44s]  But then after this, I'm going to change.
[21805.44s -> 21822.28s]  Wizard?
[21822.28s -> 21829.23s]  I don't know if I'm a wizard player.
[21829.23s -> 21831.93s]  I usually like to play casters and RPGs or whatever.
[21831.93s -> 21835.52s]  But it feels like there's a lot of micromanagement with wizard.
[21835.52s -> 21855.42s]  I'd rather just swing at stuff.
[21855.42s -> 21856.14s]  Helpful.
[21856.14s -> 21863.20s]  I did?
[21863.20s -> 21864.46s]  Yes.
[21864.46s -> 21876.78s]  Okay, you can't come through that.
[21876.78s -> 21877.42s]  No.
[21877.42s -> 21887.47s]  Do a golem RP.
[21893.13s -> 21894.65s]  Armor or magic now?
[21894.65s -> 21895.61s]  I mean, I'll hold on to these.
[21896.25s -> 21900.24s]  Oh, shit.
[21900.24s -> 21900.88s]  Let me in there.
[21901.52s -> 21919.96s]  I feel like that's really, really, really good.
[21920.52s -> 21923.08s]  It's just one of those unbelievable stat things.
[21923.08s -> 21924.28s]  That's really good.
[21924.28s -> 21925.95s]  I actually don't want to lose now.
[21925.95s -> 21930.96s]  Not like I wanted to before, but you know.
[21952.73s -> 21953.21s]  Damn.
[21953.21s -> 21954.57s]  Okay, this is what I'm talking about.
[21954.57s -> 21968.60s]  Oh, my God.
[21968.60s -> 21969.16s]  All right.
[21969.16s -> 21970.20s]  After this, if this is good,
[21970.20s -> 21971.48s]  I'm just going to literally sneak around.
[21971.48s -> 21995.68s]  Shit.
[21995.68s -> 22011.10s]  RP is you're drunk?
[22011.10s -> 22038.25s]  That's going to be so annoying.
[22038.25s -> 22038.89s]  People?
[22038.89s -> 22046.14s]  Somebody's here?
[22046.14s -> 22049.34s]  Oh, I don't even know how to play.
[22049.34s -> 22053.71s]  I don't even know where the hell to go.
[22053.71s -> 22057.66s]  I don't even know where to go.
[22057.66s -> 22058.22s]  Down here?
[22058.22s -> 22058.70s]  I don't know.
[22072.60s -> 22078.04s]  I literally don't know where to go.
[22078.04s -> 22080.52s]  I tried to do the drunk RP.
[22081.08s -> 22082.44s]  I don't know where to go.
[22082.44s -> 22083.90s]  And I was just...
[22083.90s -> 22086.46s]  Drunk RP means easy kill.
[22086.46s -> 22091.00s]  Yes, I'm realizing this right now.
[22091.00s -> 22091.64s]  That's...
[22091.64s -> 22093.56s]  Hey, this dude's shit face.
[22093.56s -> 22095.90s]  He probably has no idea what he's doing.
[22095.90s -> 22096.46s]  Just kill him.
[22110.46s -> 22111.50s]  Destroyed.
[22111.50s -> 22120.52s]  Just act crazy.
[22120.52s -> 22122.20s]  That was some good shit, too.
[22122.20s -> 22124.62s]  The mistake was going into that room.
[22124.62s -> 22126.06s]  I should have just turned around and ran.
[22126.06s -> 22147.07s]  Wait.
[22147.07s -> 22147.79s]  I got health here.
[22147.79s -> 22148.35s]  Whatever.
[22148.35s -> 22159.88s]  Oh, my God.
[22159.88s -> 22164.78s]  Good start.
[22168.16s -> 22171.79s]  Good start.
[22171.79s -> 22174.91s]  I'm going to take that in a little bit.
[22174.91s -> 22186.33s]  I have to play really, really passively.
[22186.33s -> 22202.83s]  Where is this spawner?
[22202.83s -> 22204.91s]  I forgot to buy potions again.
[22204.91s -> 22213.20s]  I'm going this way.
[22213.20s -> 22234.80s]  Okay.
[22240.35s -> 22255.63s]  Here's somebody.
[22276.38s -> 22277.34s]  Oh, shit.
[22277.34s -> 22280.60s]  Uh, where's the lever?
[22280.60s -> 22340.67s]  Stream sniper!
[22340.67s -> 22341.71s]  Stream sniper!
[22341.71s -> 22342.67s]  Stream sniper!
[22342.67s -> 22356.08s]  Stream sniper!
[22356.08s -> 22358.91s]  Actually, I'm going to stay here.
[22358.91s -> 22379.93s]  You got me right in the head, too.
[22379.93s -> 22388.67s]  There's stuff in here.
[22388.67s -> 22396.36s]  Is that locked?
[22396.36s -> 22397.64s]  Oh, my God.
[22397.64s -> 22398.52s]  Oh, my God.
[22398.52s -> 22399.08s]  I'm dead.
[22404.32s -> 22405.60s]  I don't know, man.
[22405.60s -> 22407.44s]  Like, that just did almost my whole-
[22407.44s -> 22409.12s]  That just killed me in one hit almost.
[22409.12s -> 22411.42s]  How do-
[22411.42s -> 22412.06s]  All right.
[22412.06s -> 22414.22s]  How do you fight those as melee?
[22414.22s -> 22417.36s]  I feel like they just blow up the area
[22417.36s -> 22419.36s]  like 15 feet in front of them.
[22419.36s -> 22421.52s]  How do you fight those mages as melee?
[22421.52s -> 22427.29s]  You have to jump dodge.
[22427.29s -> 22428.17s]  You don't.
[22428.17s -> 22428.81s]  You run.
[22428.81s -> 22430.09s]  You have to bait the shot.
[22430.09s -> 22433.55s]  That was an elite, too.
[22433.55s -> 22433.95s]  Yeah.
[22433.95s -> 22455.72s]  Let's fucking go.
[22484.81s -> 22492.92s]  Don't ever buy grace.
[22492.92s -> 22493.72s]  I don't care.
[22493.72s -> 22497.76s]  I'm going hard right now.
[22499.40s -> 22507.58s]  And I'm getting out.
[22507.58s -> 22511.69s]  Hey, like we were saying earlier,
[22511.69s -> 22514.22s]  beta ends in three, four days.
[22514.22s -> 22514.86s]  Whatever.
[22514.86s -> 22536.11s]  Are we ready?
[22536.11s -> 22544.44s]  This is a-
[22544.44s -> 22545.56s]  This is a big deal.
[22545.56s -> 22550.04s]  I'm about to do this in the goblin zone.
[22550.04s -> 22551.80s]  And by the way,
[22551.80s -> 22552.92s]  I ain't fucking around.
[22552.92s -> 22554.73s]  I ain't friends with anybody.
[22554.73s -> 22555.93s]  Nobody's friends.
[22555.93s -> 22556.25s]  We're not-
[22556.25s -> 22557.21s]  I'm not friends with anybody.
[22557.21s -> 22561.88s]  I think I'm ready.
[22561.88s -> 22583.85s]  It's locked in now.
[22583.85s -> 22585.79s]  Every single person is my enemy.
[22585.79s -> 22586.35s]  Not-
[22586.35s -> 22586.59s]  I-
[22586.59s -> 22588.44s]  I'm not wasting any time.
[22588.44s -> 22589.96s]  Congratulations to the stream snipers
[22589.96s -> 22592.28s]  that now are going to get a nice sword,
[22592.28s -> 22593.88s]  by the way.
[22593.88s -> 22595.48s]  Or you got to get me.
[22595.48s -> 22596.44s]  You got to kill me by the-
[22596.44s -> 22597.08s]  By the way.
[22597.08s -> 22604.57s]  I'm going to be silent as well.
[22648.92s -> 22650.64s]  What do you got?
[22650.64s -> 22664.43s]  Good start.
[22664.43s -> 22664.99s]  After these chests,
[22664.99s -> 22666.11s]  I'm going right in the middle.
[22666.11s -> 22699.85s]  Is there a potion?
[22699.85s -> 22700.65s]  I didn't see one.
[22700.65s -> 22705.47s]  Holy shit, there is a potion.
[22705.47s -> 22706.27s]  Good eyes.
[22706.27s -> 22777.76s]  I'm on a way out.
[22777.76s -> 22778.64s]  He ducked.
[22778.64s -> 22779.60s]  His animation-
[22779.60s -> 22780.40s]  Stop!
[22780.40s -> 22782.94s]  His animation made him duck.
[22782.94s -> 22849.16s]  Start looking for portals really soon here.
[22849.16s -> 22884.60s]  This thing is fucking unbelievably good.
[22884.60s -> 22885.48s]  All right, portal time.
[22940.62s -> 22960.16s]  Oh, I made it.
[22966.52s -> 22967.24s]  I had a choice,
[22967.24s -> 22971.74s]  and that was to open the portal and take a hit,
[22971.74s -> 22979.52s]  or lose the portal.
[22979.52s -> 22985.93s]  Thank god.
[22985.93s -> 22987.69s]  My adrenaline is like on fire.
[22987.69s -> 22988.57s]  It's just so-
[22988.57s -> 22989.37s]  Oh my goodness,
[22989.37s -> 22991.37s]  because you don't want to lose this thing, right?
[22991.37s -> 22993.24s]  Oh my god.
[22993.24s -> 23014.99s]  Okay, let's put it away for another three days.
[23014.99s -> 23015.95s]  I might actually-
[23026.38s -> 23027.10s]  Eh.
[23027.10s -> 23052.54s]  Oh, I don't have a weapon now.
[23052.54s -> 23053.34s]  Buy one?
[23053.34s -> 23055.04s]  You gamble?
[23055.04s -> 23055.52s]  Actually, yeah.
[23055.52s -> 23056.08s]  What do we got?
[23062.27s -> 23066.25s]  Try to gamble for like a decent weapon?
[23066.25s -> 23071.79s]  Or-
[23071.79s -> 23072.27s]  All right.
[23072.27s -> 23074.17s]  Do a weld, Andy.
[23074.17s -> 23076.52s]  I'm all right with this.
[23076.52s -> 23085.69s]  Thankfully, I didn't die,
[23085.69s -> 23087.29s]  so I get to keep the potions and everything.
[23087.29s -> 23091.24s]  I think I'm good to go.
[23091.24s -> 23099.96s]  This is pretty good.
[23099.96s -> 23101.00s]  Yeah, let's do it again.
[23101.00s -> 23111.40s]  Oh shit, I don't have any torches.
[23111.40s -> 23119.00s]  Do you have any feedback for the game?
[23121.20s -> 23127.53s]  I think it's in a really close spot.
[23127.53s -> 23129.32s]  I think that some of the-
[23129.32s -> 23131.04s]  There's obviously some of the weird bugs
[23131.04s -> 23132.80s]  when you click to swing or click to block
[23132.80s -> 23133.36s]  and it doesn't happen.
[23133.36s -> 23135.68s]  Or sometimes you just get stuck swinging permanently.
[23138.51s -> 23140.44s]  I really don't have torches.
[23140.44s -> 23143.16s]  This is kind of awful.
[23143.16s -> 23145.16s]  Besides like the gameplay-wise,
[23147.10s -> 23148.94s]  I mean, I would obviously like to see more-
[23150.14s -> 23151.42s]  I really like the PvE stuff.
[23160.12s -> 23161.40s]  I'd like to see Elmo,
[23161.40s -> 23165.64s]  like an officially licensed Elmo boss.
[23165.64s -> 23167.77s]  I don't think that's asking a lot,
[23167.77s -> 23169.13s]  which I mean, a lot of people might think it is.
[23170.09s -> 23170.41s]  What?
[23170.41s -> 23171.69s]  I thought somebody just hit me in the head.
[23182.08s -> 23185.18s]  Pick it up.
[23185.18s -> 23186.70s]  Am I crazy or is this not?
[23187.34s -> 23188.38s]  This coin doesn't exist.
[23201.55s -> 23214.28s]  Get this out of the way right now.
[23233.07s -> 23233.47s]  Heal.
[23243.87s -> 23244.19s]  Anything?
[23244.19s -> 23244.83s]  You got anything?
[23244.83s -> 23245.39s]  Oh, okay.
[23245.39s -> 23246.11s]  I'll take it.
[23246.11s -> 23255.66s]  That's it.
[23255.66s -> 23256.46s]  Oh!
[23256.46s -> 23258.14s]  Oh my God, it scares me every time.
[23258.14s -> 23259.42s]  I swear to God.
[23259.42s -> 23261.84s]  It's good.
[23261.84s -> 23271.58s]  Pick it up.
[23272.22s -> 23272.78s]  The torches.
[23272.78s -> 23273.42s]  Is it gonna do?
[23273.42s -> 23284.06s]  I've got a lot of heals.
[23284.06s -> 23287.24s]  That's why I'm doing this so much.
[23287.24s -> 23288.20s]  Oh shit, I gotta go.
[23288.20s -> 23307.84s]  I think they're above.
[23307.84s -> 23324.51s]  That's a big scary red bug.
[23324.51s -> 23327.52s]  Somebody in here?
[23327.52s -> 23349.16s]  They're up top.
[23349.16s -> 23351.23s]  Oh my God!
[23351.23s -> 23352.11s]  No, fuck.
[23352.11s -> 23352.67s]  I-
[23352.67s -> 23353.76s]  I slowed-
[23353.76s -> 23355.29s]  I fucked up.
[23355.29s -> 23357.21s]  I saw the fucking guy behind him
[23357.21s -> 23357.69s]  and I just-
[23357.69s -> 23359.61s]  I thought that boss was gonna-
[23359.61s -> 23362.30s]  So here's what happened.
[23362.30s -> 23364.60s]  I saw the boss running at him.
[23364.60s -> 23366.97s]  I thought he was gonna back up.
[23366.97s -> 23368.97s]  I didn't think he was gonna just be swinging, swinging, swinging.
[23368.97s -> 23370.73s]  I thought he was gonna back up and get hit by the boss.
[23370.73s -> 23373.50s]  I didn't know.
[23373.50s -> 23375.74s]  He was just walking forward and just clicking.
[23375.74s -> 23377.80s]  I thought he was gonna back up.
[23377.80s -> 23378.94s]  I played that wrong.
[23378.94s -> 23382.49s]  He stopped attacking.
[23382.49s -> 23384.22s]  All right, I do have a complaint.
[23384.22s -> 23385.34s]  Here's a game complaint.
[23385.34s -> 23390.94s]  The dual weld swinging is weird as fuck.
[23390.94s -> 23393.42s]  It's like right click, left click.
[23393.42s -> 23394.78s]  It feels weird.
[23394.78s -> 23398.44s]  There's something about it that just feels off.
[23398.44s -> 23401.50s]  It's like I'll swing twice
[23401.50s -> 23403.18s]  and then try to start my swing combination again
[23403.18s -> 23404.73s]  and just don't do anything.
[23404.73s -> 23407.23s]  It'll be like one, two.
[23407.23s -> 23410.19s]  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, one, two.
[23410.19s -> 23414.41s]  I'm not doing dual weld anymore.
[23414.41s -> 23421.74s]  The amount of times you have to click with a dual weld,
[23421.74s -> 23425.10s]  it's like left click, right click, right click, left click, right click, left click.
[23425.10s -> 23426.54s]  One of those clicks ain't gonna work.
[23426.54s -> 23439.71s]  You can hold left click.
[23439.71s -> 23441.87s]  Wait, I hold right click or left click?
[23441.87s -> 23443.23s]  Because when I try to do left click,
[23443.23s -> 23445.39s]  it just swings the left hand, doesn't swing the other one.
[23445.39s -> 23447.24s]  Hold down both buttons.
[23447.24s -> 23454.91s]  Hold both left and right at the same time.
[23454.91s -> 23455.55s]  What?
[23455.55s -> 23464.88s]  Hold right click, then hold left click.
[23464.88s -> 23468.72s]  I just wish I could just, I don't know.
[23468.72s -> 23472.00s]  I wish I could just click left click and swing them both.
[23472.00s -> 23475.90s]  Every other weapon in the game is left click.
[23475.90s -> 23476.86s]  Whatever.
[23476.86s -> 23478.24s]  I'm just going with nothing.
[23486.03s -> 23505.64s]  Everything else is a single weapon?
[23505.64s -> 23506.44s]  Yeah.
[23506.44s -> 23510.44s]  It's just finicky to do left click and right click at the same time
[23510.44s -> 23513.16s]  or differently, it just feels weird.
[23513.72s -> 23516.03s]  That's my opinion.
[23516.03s -> 23518.91s]  If you don't like it, then you know what to do.
[23518.91s -> 23529.72s]  I beg you for forgiveness and hoping that you don't hate me.
[23560.09s -> 23561.05s]  It's the next day?
[23562.19s -> 23562.91s]  Yeah.
[23562.91s -> 23565.18s]  I told you this is gonna be an omega stream.
[23565.18s -> 23566.14s]  Oh, I meant it.
[23566.14s -> 23575.77s]  There's a lot of spiders.
[23575.77s -> 23596.70s]  Where is the, okay, right there.
[23596.70s -> 23608.78s]  Eh, do you get no loot for the bugs?
[23608.78s -> 23609.50s]  Like the spiders.
[23612.72s -> 23613.84s]  What the fuck?
[23613.84s -> 23614.56s]  Why?
[23614.56s -> 23622.32s]  This is just kind of a pain in the ass, isn't it?
[23622.32s -> 23627.13s]  Just look at this trail of spiders.
[23627.13s -> 23629.53s]  Let's show how many of these do I have to, just get it.
[23630.72s -> 23631.76s]  God damn it.
[23644.94s -> 23645.26s]  Okay.
[23646.67s -> 23647.87s]  Yeah, that was worth it.
[23653.45s -> 23655.16s]  A lot of experience.
[23655.16s -> 23656.28s]  Oh yeah, that's good.
[23656.28s -> 23658.28s]  Very true.
[23658.28s -> 23659.08s]  Very true.
[23659.08s -> 23673.74s]  I hear somebody.
[23673.74s -> 23692.01s]  I spent so much time killing those spiders.
[23692.01s -> 23706.48s]  Someone's mining in here.
[23706.48s -> 23710.40s]  Sucks, I'm just gonna go across.
[23710.40s -> 23714.84s]  I'm coming to get you.
[23714.84s -> 23715.40s]  I'm coming to get you.
[23715.40s -> 23716.20s]  I'm coming to get you.
[23716.20s -> 23738.25s]  Oh my goodness, look at all this shit in here.
[23738.25s -> 23749.80s]  I got hit by something really awful.
[23749.80s -> 23758.67s]  No heals.
[23758.67s -> 23762.73s]  I want that shit so bad in there.
[23762.73s -> 23771.84s]  I don't know what that means.
[23771.84s -> 23773.44s]  That's not, that's not the crouch crouch.
[23773.44s -> 23774.48s]  I don't know what that means.
[23774.48s -> 23778.19s]  Oh, good.
[23778.19s -> 23811.71s]  Fucking God, how did I fall down before he did?
[23811.71s -> 23839.95s]  Hey, there's a, where is it?
[23839.95s -> 23840.67s]  I just heard it.
[23840.67s -> 23852.73s]  You are decked out.
[23852.73s -> 23854.96s]  Damn, be careful.
[23854.96s -> 23874.14s]  Smart.
[23874.14s -> 23922.46s]  I don't have my heal anymore.
[23924.57s -> 23925.93s]  Okay, if I go up this,
[23925.93s -> 23928.14s]  can I, hopefully I can turn around.
[23928.14s -> 23934.20s]  Whatever, it's worth, who cares?
[23934.20s -> 23935.48s]  No, I'm not going, I'm not doing that.
[23935.48s -> 23938.54s]  I'm not doing that.
[23938.54s -> 23939.18s]  Did he hear me?
[23940.14s -> 23953.63s]  Fuck.
[23953.63s -> 23954.27s]  Oh, okay.
[23954.27s -> 23960.25s]  I guess I'm doing it.
[23960.25s -> 23960.97s]  Where?
[23960.97s -> 23963.23s]  Oh, no.
[23964.43s -> 23965.39s]  No, I don't know.
[23965.39s -> 23965.95s]  I don't know.
[23972.38s -> 23973.74s]  It just spawned.
[23973.74s -> 23978.09s]  This, this two right here.
[23978.09s -> 23981.29s]  What's the, it's got to be some kind of mathematical equation
[23981.29s -> 23984.65s]  where they cannot be like five feet fucking next to each other.
[23984.65s -> 23986.81s]  There has to be some kind of mathematics.
[23986.81s -> 23988.65s]  They get spawning right next to each other.
[23989.21s -> 24002.73s]  It should be at least 50 to a hundred feet apart.
[24002.73s -> 24024.57s]  They spawn within the circles.
[24024.57s -> 24026.73s]  I mean, me and that guy were walking around in circles
[24027.05s -> 24028.41s]  for a full minute or two.
[24028.41s -> 24031.69s]  And the fucking bugleberry over there had two spawn next to him.
[24058.28s -> 24063.10s]  That's life in the dungeon, bro.
[24063.10s -> 24063.60s]  Yeah.
[24064.06s -> 24066.44s]  Oh no, I know.
[24066.44s -> 24070.68s]  Doesn't mean I can't die and just complain about it.
[24070.68s -> 24089.08s]  Do a bugleberry RP.
[24091.18s -> 24093.82s]  I can change class after this.
[24100.84s -> 24106.20s]  Okay, actually getting, this is a, this is a bait coin.
[24106.20s -> 24107.58s]  Been bugged the whole time.
[24109.48s -> 24110.92s]  Oh my goodness.
[24110.92s -> 24129.71s]  What if that was a blue?
[24129.71s -> 24130.27s]  Whatever.
[24130.27s -> 24152.30s]  Okay, this could be good.
[24152.30s -> 24158.22s]  I strafed that.
[24207.00s -> 24207.40s]  What?
[24207.96s -> 24211.76s]  I hit you in the head five fucking times in a row.
[24229.79s -> 24230.67s]  What the heck?
[24231.84s -> 24232.96s]  What the fuck?
[24232.96s -> 24240.76s]  Does my weapon just suck?
[24240.76s -> 24241.56s]  Bad weapon.
[24241.56s -> 24246.36s]  I mean, how many headshots from a 22, what 22 damage?
[24246.36s -> 24248.04s]  Two, four, six, eight, 10.
[24248.04s -> 24249.80s]  I mean, well, that would have to have been a hundred plus.
[24249.80s -> 24250.92s]  How much was that?
[24250.92s -> 24262.36s]  Three potion.
[24266.19s -> 24266.43s]  All right.
[24266.43s -> 24270.19s]  There was at least three or four times in a row where it was like headshot.
[24270.44s -> 24271.32s]  Back up.
[24271.32s -> 24272.04s]  Headshot.
[24272.04s -> 24272.92s]  Back up.
[24272.92s -> 24273.80s]  Headshot.
[24273.80s -> 24274.36s]  Back up.
[24274.36s -> 24275.80s]  I get hit twice and I'm dead.
[24275.80s -> 24279.48s]  God, we, we had the same clothes on.
[24279.48s -> 24280.68s]  We had the same clothing.
[24290.64s -> 24292.00s]  They had the shrine of protection.
[24292.88s -> 24302.43s]  God damn it.
[24302.43s -> 24307.32s]  Oh, I was gonna say something.
[24307.32s -> 24307.96s]  Change class.
[24307.96s -> 24309.88s]  I know, I can't go out on that one.
[24309.88s -> 24317.82s]  I felt really good about that fight too.
[24317.82s -> 24334.16s]  So bandy.
[24334.16s -> 24334.64s]  Goodbye.
[24340.56s -> 24342.48s]  Okay, we're not doing this either.
[24342.48s -> 24344.32s]  I like it.
[24344.32s -> 24346.28s]  I could take one.
[24346.28s -> 24348.28s]  No, I get killed before I open the door.
[24362.49s -> 24375.24s]  Yes, good luck.
[24411.90s -> 24415.90s]  Did you do it?
[24415.90s -> 24424.32s]  Oh my God.
[24431.24s -> 24432.84s]  He's gonna get killed by the fucking mage.
[24433.48s -> 24434.52s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[24434.52s -> 24435.02s]  Just.
[24435.88s -> 24442.00s]  Oh no.
[24448.57s -> 24463.07s]  You actually almost killed me.
[24463.07s -> 24464.51s]  That was actually really well done.
[24464.51s -> 24469.00s]  That was a lot of perseverance.
[24469.00s -> 24469.64s]  Seriously.
[24469.64s -> 24484.64s]  Oh shit.
[24484.64s -> 24498.19s]  I'm just wearing all his clothes.
[24498.19s -> 24499.95s]  Wait, what if I take it and resurrect him?
[24499.95s -> 24506.24s]  Oh, Jack is style.
[24506.24s -> 24535.58s]  Boy, where are you?
[24535.58s -> 24540.46s]  Where is this character?
[24540.46s -> 24547.31s]  I don't, I actually don't see them.
[24547.31s -> 24549.16s]  Where is this?
[24549.16s -> 24550.04s]  Where are they?
[24557.15s -> 24558.83s]  There's no way you.
[24558.83s -> 24564.92s]  There's no way you're shooting me from up there.
[24564.92s -> 24567.90s]  From back there?
[24567.90s -> 24570.30s]  Aiming down and in the hole?
[24570.30s -> 24579.77s]  Dak and daka, you know.
[24579.77s -> 24580.81s]  Why didn't I run?
[24580.81s -> 24587.77s]  Because I wanted to go through that way.
[24587.77s -> 24589.37s]  Dead and bald.
[24589.37s -> 24594.84s]  Class change?
[24594.84s -> 24597.69s]  Yeah, after this.
[24597.69s -> 24599.69s]  Is this game good or are you just bad and make it awful?
[24601.15s -> 24603.36s]  Go download it.
[24603.36s -> 24604.24s]  Go download it.
[24604.24s -> 24605.84s]  Go play it for 45 minutes.
[24605.84s -> 24620.22s]  And then I want you to come back and report on how you did.
[24620.22s -> 24622.14s]  And then play it for like another 100 hours.
[24622.14s -> 24625.53s]  And realize that it's dak and daka.
[24625.53s -> 24631.24s]  Doesn't matter.
[24631.24s -> 24633.08s]  People will just screw you over at every turn.
[24633.08s -> 24633.88s]  People will kill you.
[24633.88s -> 24637.42s]  People will try to be friends with you and then backstab you.
[24637.42s -> 24642.06s]  People might lock you in a room with a bunch of monsters.
[24642.06s -> 24644.68s]  And then, you know, it's dak and daka.
[24661.50s -> 24664.06s]  But you died by standing under an archer on purpose.
[24664.06s -> 24669.21s]  See that?
[24669.21s -> 24686.91s]  I thought he was dead.
[24686.91s -> 24689.23s]  You have to seriously block me in here with all this.
[24689.23s -> 24736.52s]  I was going to say, there's a lot of shit in here.
[24736.52s -> 24737.16s]  Hold on.
[24737.16s -> 24753.45s]  Now we're talking.
[24753.45s -> 24769.28s]  Did I loot this already?
[24769.28s -> 24791.56s]  I'm going to stay up.
[24791.56s -> 24831.10s]  Oh shit.
[24831.10s -> 24832.51s]  Oh, yup.
[24832.51s -> 24839.93s]  People are coming and I don't want to do well.
[24839.93s -> 24844.01s]  I'll have you.
[24844.01s -> 24846.52s]  Hold down right click.
[24846.52s -> 24848.12s]  Hold down right click and left click.
[24848.12s -> 24862.17s]  What is with this barrel?
[24865.31s -> 24865.95s]  Hey.
[24865.95s -> 24869.93s]  Hey, what's up?
[24869.93s -> 24873.98s]  Do you have any shielding?
[24875.26s -> 24875.98s]  Let me check.
[24875.98s -> 24886.91s]  Sorry, I do not.
[24886.91s -> 24887.47s]  I would have.
[24887.47s -> 24888.43s]  I would have given it to you.
[24888.43s -> 24888.99s]  I promise you.
[24888.99s -> 24901.76s]  I'll stick with you, dude.
[24901.76s -> 24905.48s]  I don't know how to play the gun.
[24905.48s -> 24906.60s]  It's very hard.
[24906.60s -> 24907.64s]  It is no joke.
[24907.64s -> 24912.01s]  I've done high roller twice.
[24912.01s -> 24914.59s]  And I've lived times.
[24914.59s -> 24917.87s]  And I don't think I've lived once during this fucking cave.
[24917.87s -> 24920.46s]  So be careful.
[24920.46s -> 24922.14s]  People are known to double cross each other here.
[24922.14s -> 24924.14s]  Especially if they say they're a friend at first.
[24924.14s -> 24925.69s]  Goodbye, dude.
[24927.05s -> 24929.10s]  See, I told you about this spider.
[24929.10s -> 24930.70s]  You know, I'm not going to double cross.
[24930.70s -> 24932.86s]  I'm going to die.
[24937.16s -> 24938.36s]  That was a little rusty.
[24938.36s -> 24939.24s]  I'm a little rusty.
[24939.24s -> 24940.28s]  All right, let's move.
[24940.28s -> 24944.81s]  Look, man, I know there's a pot of spiders back here.
[24944.81s -> 24945.53s]  That's all I know.
[24949.80s -> 24950.44s]  We need light.
[24951.08s -> 24951.64s]  We need light.
[24953.08s -> 24957.26s]  Why are there so many?
[24957.26s -> 24959.26s]  This is like, where's the spawner?
[24959.26s -> 24959.98s]  Is there like 10 of them?
[24963.04s -> 24964.00s]  Pot of spiders.
[24964.00s -> 24965.12s]  You need to, oh, good job.
[24965.12s -> 24965.92s]  All right, let's get out of here.
[24965.92s -> 24966.08s]  Come on.
[24966.08s -> 24967.12s]  Yeah, we got to get out of here.
[24974.92s -> 24975.56s]  Shit.
[24975.56s -> 24976.28s]  Hey, get in here.
[24976.28s -> 24976.76s]  Get in here.
[24977.48s -> 24978.92s]  My buddy told me about this door.
[24980.27s -> 24983.31s]  I present to you Golgotha.
[24984.03s -> 24986.28s]  You think we can take him?
[24989.76s -> 24990.88s]  You think we can do it?
[24990.88s -> 24991.60s]  You got good gear?
[24992.24s -> 24993.66s]  Nope.
[24993.66s -> 24994.62s]  But it's too late now.
[24996.48s -> 24997.12s]  He can't make it.
[25002.40s -> 25008.08s]  OK, I'm sorry you didn't make it.
[25008.08s -> 25009.52s]  I don't know if we were prepared for this.
[25017.74s -> 25018.78s]  This is like a boss.
[25019.42s -> 25027.66s]  All right, I got to get out of here now.
[25027.66s -> 25028.70s]  I think I'm just dead.
[25028.70s -> 25031.85s]  Is there another way to get out?
[25031.85s -> 25033.13s]  No, I have to run.
[25033.13s -> 25036.24s]  I'm stuck.
[25037.04s -> 25037.92s]  What is going on?
[25040.62s -> 25043.05s]  Let me fucking out of here.
[25043.85s -> 25050.40s]  Where is it?
[25050.96s -> 25051.44s]  Where is it?
[25052.00s -> 25056.44s]  Where is it?
[25056.44s -> 25073.40s]  It's up top.
[25074.68s -> 25075.96s]  I'm dead.
[25075.96s -> 25080.00s]  I don't know.
[25080.00s -> 25081.44s]  I have no idea where it is.
[25081.44s -> 25083.60s]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[25083.60s -> 25085.84s]  Yeah, I don't have very much help though.
[25085.84s -> 25110.91s]  Will another one spawn in the circle?
[25110.91s -> 25112.75s]  Got to make a choice and go.
[25112.75s -> 25114.30s]  I got to make a choice here.
[25114.30s -> 25115.66s]  Yeah, we got to make a choice.
[25115.66s -> 25116.46s]  I got to make a choice.
[25116.94s -> 25118.14s]  I don't know how to go up though.
[25118.14s -> 25119.02s]  I don't know where I am.
[25119.02s -> 25119.82s]  I don't know where to go.
[25119.82s -> 25121.29s]  Do you know how to go up?
[25121.29s -> 25129.34s]  I just don't know the layout.
[25129.34s -> 25131.37s]  Like this way?
[25131.37s -> 25133.92s]  Oh, we're dead.
[25133.92s -> 25134.40s]  Map?
[25134.40s -> 25142.92s]  I don't even know what up looks like.
[25142.92s -> 25144.28s]  No, I'm dead if I go that way.
[25144.28s -> 25146.89s]  I'm dead.
[25146.89s -> 25148.46s]  There's nowhere to go.
[25148.46s -> 25149.90s]  I wouldn't have made it.
[25149.90s -> 25161.42s]  Were there any left?
[25161.42s -> 25162.38s]  I think somebody got it.
[25162.38s -> 25167.13s]  I just don't...
[25167.13s -> 25171.12s]  The amount of levels that are in this zone,
[25171.12s -> 25174.12s]  I feel like a handful of people just get screwed
[25174.12s -> 25178.38s]  because they're not on the right level when the shit spawns.
[25178.38s -> 25179.80s]  And it's like if I don't have health,
[25179.96s -> 25180.44s]  I'm just...
[25180.44s -> 25182.20s]  I'll just die.
[25182.20s -> 25192.00s]  Go back to the side ramp where you got to the troll.
[25192.00s -> 25192.72s]  I just...
[25192.72s -> 25203.79s]  Yeah.
[25203.79s -> 25207.15s]  Guaranteed extract on here is represented by the stairs symbol.
[25207.15s -> 25226.51s]  It means the stone's collapsing earlier.
[25226.51s -> 25228.67s]  The rock slide is a secret escape.
[25228.67s -> 25230.38s]  Really?
[25230.38s -> 25238.52s]  I thought that person went in there and got crushed by the rocks.
[25238.52s -> 25258.62s]  The rock slide means only one can come out.
[25258.62s -> 25259.58s]  You know what it is to me?
[25259.58s -> 25263.16s]  It's just kind of getting that object permanence
[25263.16s -> 25265.93s]  of just where everything is on the map.
[25265.93s -> 25268.09s]  That's always been hard for me to do.
[25268.09s -> 25270.80s]  Because to me, those...
[25270.80s -> 25274.09s]  All those hallways are just the same hallway in my brain.
[25274.09s -> 25275.53s]  It's just the same hallway.
[25275.53s -> 25277.87s]  It's just like a shredded up piece of paper.
[25277.87s -> 25278.43s]  I don't even...
[25278.43s -> 25279.15s]  I can't even...
[25279.15s -> 25280.35s]  My brain can't translate it.
[25289.24s -> 25290.12s]  I think I'm dead already.
[25292.99s -> 25296.32s]  Okay, bye.
[25297.04s -> 25297.76s]  Bye, I guess.
[25330.59s -> 25331.31s]  Light orb.
[25332.35s -> 25335.13s]  I want chain lightning.
[25335.13s -> 25336.33s]  Zap is kind of bad.
[25336.33s -> 25342.48s]  Fireball, magic missile, lightning strike.
[25344.75s -> 25345.55s]  Haste is good.
[25346.57s -> 25347.05s]  Slow is...
[25347.93s -> 25349.05s]  I think slow would be good too.
[25349.85s -> 25351.13s]  Use it on people and run away.
[25351.13s -> 25355.50s]  Try this.
[25356.30s -> 25358.06s]  I really have no idea what I'm doing, but I'll try.
[25392.80s -> 25394.24s]  Ouchie, ouchies.
[25394.24s -> 25415.10s]  MOU using the lobby is consumed.
[25415.10s -> 25416.65s]  Oh, that sucks.
[25416.65s -> 25417.77s]  Okay, well, oops.
[25422.54s -> 25423.42s]  That's funny.
[25423.42s -> 25449.10s]  Oh, I got a thing or two to learn.
[25449.10s -> 25450.06s]  Shit, that's a lot.
[25450.06s -> 25451.18s]  Oh my god, that's a lot.
[25451.18s -> 25452.38s]  I'm just going to hide and leave.
[25452.38s -> 25454.36s]  I'm going to...
[25454.36s -> 25456.12s]  Okay, I'm going to sprint to the middle right now.
[25456.12s -> 25468.24s]  I'll have enough to buy another purple.
[25468.24s -> 25468.72s]  Rock slide?
[25468.72s -> 25490.97s]  Where is the rock slide?
[25490.97s -> 25491.69s]  Oh, come on.
[25491.69s -> 25519.77s]  Fuck you.
[25551.95s -> 25552.27s]  Fuck!
[25552.99s -> 25554.19s]  Okay, it's kind of fun.
[25554.19s -> 25555.55s]  It's kind of fun, but I got...
[25555.55s -> 25556.91s]  I had to fight like three enemies
[25556.91s -> 25559.23s]  and I fucked up and I blew myself up in the first two seconds.
[25559.23s -> 25571.87s]  I was thinking like slow him
[25571.87s -> 25573.31s]  and then maybe get him with a magic missile.
[25573.31s -> 25574.27s]  I don't know.
[25574.27s -> 25575.63s]  Haste always first.
[25575.63s -> 25578.32s]  Can I cast it on myself?
[25578.32s -> 25585.84s]  What do you got on you?
[25585.84s -> 25590.68s]  Nice...
[25590.68s -> 25593.93s]  Oh, nice duck.
[25593.93s -> 25595.37s]  Haste then invis.
[25595.37s -> 25604.96s]  Yeah, you can give buffs to enemies.
[25604.96s -> 25605.84s]  That's true.
[25605.84s -> 25607.21s]  I've actually seen it happen.
[25607.21s -> 25610.48s]  You're yelling a lot.
[25610.48s -> 25615.23s]  Oak is a good mage.
[25615.23s -> 25619.08s]  You can probably give some pointers.
[25619.08s -> 25619.80s]  Maybe, yeah.
[25619.80s -> 25625.36s]  It's happened to my buddy Eric.
[25625.36s -> 25627.40s]  Oh, shit.
[25627.40s -> 25639.95s]  Buddy Eric died, nice.
[25647.58s -> 25648.70s]  Did I do it?
[25648.70s -> 25649.90s]  Okay, I did it.
[25649.90s -> 25687.84s]  Fuck, that's a long lead time.
[25687.92s -> 25693.95s]  What is happening?
[25693.95s -> 25695.95s]  Oh, they're homing missiles, kind of.
[25695.95s -> 25702.65s]  Is that for me?
[25702.65s -> 25722.75s]  Move speed, weapon damage.
[25722.75s -> 25724.59s]  Wait, does it actually count as a staff?
[25724.59s -> 25735.53s]  Like can I use it as a staff?
[25735.53s -> 25736.65s]  What's the meditate button?
[25736.65s -> 25745.53s]  This is very dangerous.
[25745.53s -> 25795.76s]  Oh, fuck.
[25795.76s -> 25798.00s]  Oh, I didn't know what to do.
[25798.00s -> 25812.88s]  I feel like I was just dead no matter what there.
[25812.88s -> 25816.17s]  Use invisibility and run.
[25816.17s -> 25817.53s]  I should probably put that on.
[25817.53s -> 25818.97s]  You cast haste on him?
[25818.97s -> 25820.62s]  That wasn't slow?
[25820.62s -> 25833.88s]  That was definitely slow.
[25833.88s -> 25838.75s]  Wizard is really hard to play on the Goblin map.
[25838.75s -> 25840.92s]  I feel like Wizard's probably really hard to play
[25840.92s -> 25841.88s]  on any map.
[25841.88s -> 25845.74s]  And you just really need to learn how to play and get good.
[25845.74s -> 25847.42s]  But yes, I do agree.
[25847.42s -> 25850.57s]  This is probably a bad place to try to learn how to play Wizard.
[25850.57s -> 25864.36s]  If I just, okay.
[25864.36s -> 25865.88s]  So is that always on me?
[25865.88s -> 25866.84s]  It is, all right.
[25866.84s -> 25883.64s]  I just missed every single shot.
[25883.64s -> 25884.36s]  I thought I was homing.
[25902.27s -> 25933.50s]  Oh, shoot.
[25945.96s -> 25948.80s]  Okay, that's pretty fun.
[25948.80s -> 25966.70s]  I need, okay, I need to meditate somewhere.
[25966.70s -> 25970.76s]  I'm gonna do it here, who cares?
[25970.76s -> 25973.58s]  You almost chain lightning to yourself.
[25973.58s -> 25974.94s]  That can happen, that's true.
[25974.94s -> 25990.84s]  Like everything, kind of.
[25990.84s -> 25992.04s]  All right, what about anything?
[25992.04s -> 26042.32s]  I need to meditate again.
[26042.32s -> 26048.43s]  Is it going on?
[26048.43s -> 26062.97s]  Is there a way to get spells back better than this?
[26062.97s -> 26066.17s]  Or you just have to do, you just have to get, okay.
[26066.17s -> 26067.13s]  That's not too bad.
[26067.13s -> 26076.75s]  I think there's a portal underneath me.
[26076.75s -> 26078.57s]  I saw a bunch of blue.
[26104.51s -> 26109.05s]  Whatever, don't cast that.
[26109.05s -> 26110.52s]  Oh, fuck.
[26110.52s -> 26112.92s]  Oh no, I didn't see this.
[26112.92s -> 26138.04s]  I just need to get out of here.
[26138.04s -> 26156.06s]  If you get out with some gold, Alchemist sells spell books.
[26156.06s -> 26158.83s]  True, I'm gonna try to get out though.
[26158.83s -> 26170.40s]  I have nothing to do with this shit.
[26170.40s -> 26176.86s]  Oh, this is ugly.
[26176.86s -> 26179.42s]  Look at all these fucking spiders.
[26179.42s -> 26192.04s]  Oh, come on, man.
[26198.32s -> 26204.76s]  Oh my God, there's shit everywhere.
[26204.76s -> 26205.72s]  What killed me?
[26205.72s -> 26207.16s]  A trap on the ground.
[26207.16s -> 26210.00s]  It's so stressful.
[26210.00s -> 26211.76s]  I juked so many people there
[26211.76s -> 26214.08s]  and a trap on the ground is pitch black.
[26214.08s -> 26224.43s]  I was the last player too.
[26224.43s -> 26232.80s]  I feel like I'd rather go against groups
[26232.80s -> 26234.81s]  than any of the PvE.
[26236.25s -> 26238.35s]  I feel like I just, when you run out of spells,
[26238.35s -> 26239.79s]  you kind of just in trouble.
[26239.79s -> 26250.17s]  Crystal Sword is good.
[26250.17s -> 26253.31s]  You can always buy one too.
[26253.31s -> 26256.12s]  Drink some water.
[26256.12s -> 26257.80s]  I got a big, big water right here.
[26257.80s -> 26298.60s]  I'm good to go.
[26298.60s -> 26301.00s]  One, you're gonna let one bug kill you, man.
[26328.80s -> 26329.84s]  Come on, what's this?
[26339.26s -> 26341.02s]  How did I end up in the same corner?
[26341.02s -> 26343.45s]  How did I end up in the same corner?
[26343.45s -> 26364.78s]  Oh, it's because you're red.
[26364.78s -> 26366.14s]  Okay, I get it.
[26366.14s -> 26380.56s]  I didn't want to do that.
[26380.56s -> 26424.04s]  Did that waste a spell?
[26424.04s -> 26434.04s]  Get off that!
[26434.04s -> 26435.24s]  That, I was so far away.
[26435.24s -> 26437.88s]  That goes very, oh, don't breathe that.
[26437.88s -> 26449.40s]  That goes really far.
[26449.40s -> 26451.00s]  Water makes it go farther.
[26451.00s -> 26458.68s]  Very good to know.
[26458.68s -> 26459.16s]  Thank you.
[26463.20s -> 26465.68s]  You're in the worst possible spot you could be in.
[26465.68s -> 26486.97s]  I want to just get out and make a little bit of money.
[26486.97s -> 26491.60s]  Hey, I'm showing my friends at college your stream.
[26491.60s -> 26492.56s]  Can you say something funny?
[26495.74s -> 26500.78s]  All of you in the room right now, go do your homework.
[26500.78s -> 26503.74s]  If you already did, good for you.
[26503.74s -> 26506.97s]  You should eat Cheetos.
[26506.97s -> 26509.87s]  You should split a bag of Cheetos.
[26509.87s -> 26511.15s]  Not one bag each of you.
[26511.15s -> 26512.19s]  Split a bag of Cheetos.
[26512.19s -> 26513.63s]  It's battening shit.
[26513.63s -> 26536.64s]  Hey, what was that?
[26539.00s -> 26540.92s]  Where did, what happened here?
[26540.92s -> 26542.44s]  That was very strange.
[26542.44s -> 26544.36s]  Very strange, very strange.
[26545.56s -> 26546.92s]  They went through the ceiling.
[26549.00s -> 26553.48s]  What?
[26553.48s -> 26554.76s]  Hold on, what happened?
[26554.76s -> 26556.12s]  Was he behind the pillar?
[26567.53s -> 26569.37s]  I heard footsteps, footsteps, footsteps.
[26569.37s -> 26571.61s]  And then he was above you and jumped down.
[26576.73s -> 26578.33s]  This is not the kind of class I can play.
[26579.21s -> 26582.84s]  It's too much like micromanagement.
[26582.84s -> 26584.76s]  Picking up items, like going like this.
[26584.76s -> 26585.40s]  I'm like, what spell is this?
[26585.40s -> 26586.76s]  I don't know how to do this one.
[26586.76s -> 26589.18s]  And then attack and then meditate.
[26589.18s -> 26590.06s]  Someone's going to just going to,
[26590.06s -> 26591.26s]  I'm literally going to be tunnel vision.
[26591.26s -> 26592.86s]  Someone's going to jump down and axe me in the head.
[26592.86s -> 26603.39s]  Why do that when a barbarian can hit you in the head
[26603.39s -> 26604.51s]  and kill you in two hits?
[26604.51s -> 26618.30s]  Better for when you're in a group.
[26618.30s -> 26626.44s]  I've actually seen some cracked out wizard gameplay.
[26626.44s -> 26630.20s]  I watched Moon Moon play with wizard for a little bit.
[26630.76s -> 26634.43s]  And he was so unbelievably good.
[26634.43s -> 26635.55s]  I thought he was hacking.
[26638.03s -> 26639.23s]  It was like, he was just like,
[26642.27s -> 26644.19s]  he like killed six people at one point in a row.
[26644.75s -> 26646.35s]  And I was just like, holy shit.
[26647.47s -> 26648.59s]  He's so good.
[26648.59s -> 26649.63s]  How do you get that good?
[26651.47s -> 26673.82s]  It was mind boggling.
[26673.82s -> 26675.34s]  Get this fucking shit off my screen.
[26675.34s -> 26677.40s]  I can't play wizard.
[26688.12s -> 26690.84s]  I actually could see how this would be like in a group.
[26695.12s -> 26697.28s]  Standing still in this game for more than a second or two
[26697.28s -> 26699.98s]  is just, I just, I feel naked.
[26699.98s -> 26718.12s]  I'm like already dead too.
[26718.12s -> 26719.71s]  Oh God, fuck that.
[26719.71s -> 26720.99s]  I've got nothing to do with this.
[26729.21s -> 26729.93s]  Your loot sucks.
[26729.93s -> 26730.89s]  You may as well be.
[26731.77s -> 26750.83s]  Please don't kill me.
[26750.83s -> 26751.79s]  Please don't kill me.
[26751.79s -> 26752.29s]  Please.
[26753.63s -> 26778.36s]  I'll try this one more time.
[26778.36s -> 26779.88s]  But I need to play in a group.
[26779.88s -> 26783.23s]  You can fireball the door.
[26783.23s -> 26784.43s]  Oh shit, I didn't know that.
[26784.43s -> 26802.43s]  Please try rogue.
[26802.43s -> 26804.92s]  I'll play rogue next time I play.
[26804.92s -> 26805.72s]  Next time I stream.
[26805.72s -> 26807.00s]  I'm streaming this on Friday.
[26807.00s -> 26814.09s]  Friday will be rogue day.
[26814.09s -> 26821.23s]  Let me at least try to get
[26821.23s -> 26823.47s]  at least somewhat anything going with this character.
[26823.47s -> 26845.39s]  I just made fucking popcorn.
[26845.39s -> 26846.43s]  Anybody want some?
[26846.43s -> 26861.84s]  Go back to, so bad.
[26861.84s -> 26863.84s]  Yeah, I got, I don't, I gotta learn,
[26863.84s -> 26866.00s]  I gotta learn how to play with this character.
[26866.00s -> 26869.36s]  I've played, almost every moment of my time
[26869.36s -> 26871.39s]  has been on fighter.
[26871.39s -> 26873.39s]  I'm like holding right click to block.
[26873.39s -> 26875.87s]  It's been like 15 hours on one character.
[26875.87s -> 26906.97s]  What did you eat for breakfast?
[26906.97s -> 26917.36s]  Two ovaries, the eggs.
[26917.36s -> 26920.52s]  Early game, no gear wizard.
[26920.52s -> 26923.16s]  I feel like if I, if I, I feel like I can't engage.
[26923.24s -> 26925.53s]  I have to stop engaging enemies.
[26925.53s -> 26927.29s]  Only if there's like one or two.
[26927.29s -> 26929.76s]  You can't just like walk around.
[26929.76s -> 26941.13s]  I have to get out at least once.
[26941.13s -> 26945.90s]  They have to be really far away too.
[26945.90s -> 26947.18s]  I keep walking.
[26947.18s -> 26947.98s]  Oh, there's enemies.
[26947.98s -> 26949.34s]  I'm gonna cast my spells right here.
[26949.34s -> 26951.50s]  And they're as far away as the fucking torches.
[26951.50s -> 26952.59s]  They're just dead.
[26952.59s -> 26989.42s]  Okay, anything else?
[26989.42s -> 26995.42s]  I think the fire on the ground.
[26996.14s -> 27021.82s]  I can't believe you actually hit me.
[27021.82s -> 27022.46s]  That's weird.
[27022.46s -> 27031.58s]  I feel like you shouldn't have.
[27031.58s -> 27032.46s]  No, don't.
[27032.46s -> 27044.97s]  Water sap is strong.
[27046.28s -> 27062.92s]  Magic missile seems really, really good.
[27062.92s -> 27064.44s]  Oh, that was unfortunate.
[27064.44s -> 27080.57s]  What the hell just happened?
[27080.57s -> 27082.70s]  Was that a player?
[27086.80s -> 27088.72s]  Oh, I'm so fucking in trouble here.
[27094.17s -> 27097.29s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[27102.16s -> 27102.56s]  What?
[27102.56s -> 27104.24s]  Why is, what is going on?
[27104.24s -> 27106.00s]  This skeleton's a barbarian?
[27107.12s -> 27107.92s]  What?
[27107.92s -> 27109.12s]  What's happening?
[27109.12s -> 27110.64s]  He's, oh, he's got the skin.
[27110.64s -> 27112.40s]  I thought he was a fucking NPC.
[27116.27s -> 27116.59s]  What?
[27117.31s -> 27123.82s]  I thought he was one of the skeletons in this room.
[27123.82s -> 27126.78s]  And when he started just chasing me like crazy and throwing bombs.
[27126.78s -> 27141.28s]  And I was like, what's happening?
[27141.28s -> 27148.33s]  They all have it?
[27148.33s -> 27148.97s]  Damn.
[27148.97s -> 27149.53s]  Okay.
[27149.53s -> 27151.28s]  Oops.
[27151.52s -> 27164.48s]  I didn't mean to exit the whole game.
[27164.48s -> 27167.71s]  I'm going to do three more.
[27167.71s -> 27193.95s]  Three more and I'll play Rogue.
[27193.95s -> 27194.83s]  Bloody mouth.
[27194.83s -> 27200.92s]  How does this work?
[27200.92s -> 27206.38s]  Let's find out.
[27206.38s -> 27207.18s]  Lockpick.
[27207.18s -> 27213.39s]  The next successful attack causes the target to bleed
[27213.39s -> 27219.76s]  because this is the bleed and this is stealth.
[27219.76s -> 27226.80s]  Okay.
[27226.80s -> 27243.32s]  If you're hiding, you can move 10 steps.
[27243.32s -> 27257.82s]  Let's give it a go.
[27257.82s -> 27258.78s]  Yeah, I'll do three more.
[27258.78s -> 27259.58s]  Only three more.
[27259.58s -> 27262.51s]  I want to, I don't know how to overdo it.
[27262.51s -> 27275.04s]  This does not have a right click.
[27275.04s -> 27278.00s]  That's, now if I stab, it's going to be poison.
[27279.20s -> 27282.09s]  Let's try it on somebody.
[27282.09s -> 27282.41s]  Okay.
[27282.41s -> 27295.08s]  Three more.
[27295.08s -> 27297.72s]  So how to, biting NPCs.
[27297.72s -> 27303.05s]  PVE.
[27303.05s -> 27305.29s]  Run around, dodge and stuff.
[27305.29s -> 27321.98s]  Press the wrong button.
[27321.98s -> 27322.78s]  That's poison.
[27322.78s -> 27324.38s]  Is there anyone to tell if it's ticking?
[27324.38s -> 27326.14s]  Or is it just on them?
[27337.34s -> 27339.18s]  I just have to assume that it's on, right?
[27339.18s -> 27356.33s]  It's fun.
[27356.33s -> 27364.00s]  Let me try this.
[27364.00s -> 27365.21s]  So I'm, all right.
[27365.21s -> 27366.81s]  So I'm invisible right now.
[27366.81s -> 27368.09s]  So I can go one.
[27368.09s -> 27369.21s]  Wait, I thought I could walk.
[27369.21s -> 27372.99s]  I thought I could do 10 steps.
[27377.55s -> 27378.51s]  Oh, it's only while crouching.
[27378.51s -> 27379.01s]  Okay.
[27390.76s -> 27392.04s]  Well, I'm just dead.
[27395.60s -> 27399.05s]  We're, god, dude.
[27399.05s -> 27400.33s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[27400.33s -> 27400.83s]  No.
[27402.72s -> 27403.20s]  No, yeah.
[27403.20s -> 27403.52s]  Listen.
[27403.52s -> 27404.40s]  Listen to him.
[27404.40s -> 27404.90s]  No.
[27411.02s -> 27411.66s]  Help me.
[27411.66s -> 27412.46s]  Help me just go.
[27413.66s -> 27414.16s]  Help me.
[27414.94s -> 27415.44s]  Help.
[27417.10s -> 27418.38s]  Everyone in this room is going to die.
[27418.94s -> 27420.14s]  Everybody in this room is going to die.
[27420.14s -> 27420.78s]  I'm just saying.
[27422.25s -> 27424.09s]  Like this, they're not going to make it out of this.
[27438.38s -> 27460.99s]  There's so many people.
[27460.99s -> 27462.59s]  I hit exit game again.
[27462.59s -> 27463.31s]  Oh my god.
[27463.31s -> 27464.75s]  I'm just getting fucking tired now.
[27469.80s -> 27470.60s]  Shit.
[27470.60s -> 27490.43s]  Somebody saying I'm not doing poison.
[27490.43s -> 27503.63s]  I think I am.
[27503.63s -> 27507.70s]  Rupture?
[27509.60s -> 27521.04s]  Oh, wait a minute. That's not poison. Wait. Poisoned weapon.
[27521.04s -> 27526.19s]  Mmm.
[27526.19s -> 27540.10s]  So this is just a bleed. Bleed and poison stacked. They stack together, I'm imagining, right?
[27540.10s -> 27543.80s]  Yeah, there we go. Okay.
[27543.80s -> 27561.32s]  Alright, two more.
[27561.32s -> 27572.96s]  Why are we resorting to violence?
[27572.96s -> 27575.92s]  You gotta do three more and one comedy run.
[27575.92s -> 27597.55s]  Hmm. We'll see. She knows.
[27597.55s -> 27610.88s]  Bro sucks.
[27610.88s -> 27624.19s]  That's a horrible room.
[27624.19s -> 27629.64s]  I'm friendly.
[27629.64s -> 27631.92s]  Yeah, I'm friendly, bro.
[27631.92s -> 27635.58s]  Excellent.
[27635.58s -> 27637.18s]  You need any healing?
[27637.18s -> 27638.48s]  Uh, let me see.
[27638.48s -> 27641.14s]  Nah, I'm good. How you doing?
[27641.14s -> 27643.54s]  Alright, bro. I'm chilling.
[27643.54s -> 27647.36s]  Let's loot this room. There's a lot of stuff in here. Be careful though, there's demons.
[27647.36s -> 27680.19s]  What the hell?
[27680.19s -> 27683.83s]  Wait, hell just kind of just went to zero. I don't know what happened. I don't know.
[27683.83s -> 27686.17s]  The poison killed me?
[27686.17s -> 27704.47s]  The goblin spell did a U-turn.
[27704.47s -> 27710.73s]  That guy is going to be talking to me because there's no possible way that I die there.
[27710.73s -> 27732.10s]  He's probably still talking to me. And I've just been gone for 30 straight seconds.
[27732.10s -> 27738.25s]  Hmm. This game is so fun.
[27738.25s -> 27743.74s]  Alright, let me get a good one. I feel like I haven't had a good one in at least five to ten attempts.
[27743.74s -> 27746.37s]  It's been a bunch of horse shit.
[27746.37s -> 27771.57s]  Everybody stop everything we're doing.
[27771.57s -> 27779.01s]  Little Caesar's pretzel crust pizza is back.
[27779.01s -> 27798.18s]  My jaw is hitting the floor right now.
[27798.18s -> 27802.15s]  Can I actually break this with this weapon?
[27802.15s -> 27805.15s]  Or what? That's weird.
[27805.15s -> 27812.21s]  No, I can't. That's annoying.
[27812.21s -> 27833.70s]  Okay, I got a big problem.
[27833.70s -> 27843.50s]  And it's called, I keep forgetting which is bound to what.
[27843.50s -> 27846.94s]  I got to...what? Okay, it's on my thumb buttons that's why.
[27846.94s -> 27849.34s]  And they're right next to each other and it takes me a minute to figure it out.
[27849.34s -> 27853.26s]  I'm not going this way.
[27853.26s -> 27868.03s]  That's so annoying.
[27868.03s -> 27870.03s]  Stuck. Stuck. Stuck.
[27870.03s -> 27884.12s]  I'm going to step on the trap in a second, aren't I?
[27884.12s -> 27904.80s]  Oh my god, do I not have that perk? Did I switch it out? I was crouched.
[27904.80s -> 27913.65s]  I'm so confused.
[27913.65s -> 27927.47s]  Oh, poison.
[27927.47s -> 27937.72s]  Swing!
[27937.72s -> 27949.98s]  It's doing that thing again.
[27949.98s -> 27968.57s]  I hear somebody.
[27968.57s -> 27969.57s]  Fuck you.
[27969.57s -> 28004.47s]  Barbarian?
[28004.47s -> 28006.43s]  There's a barbarian somewhere right here.
[28006.43s -> 28008.03s]  What happened? This is a wall, I think.
[28008.03s -> 28016.50s]  Shit, I got to put that on a different keybind.
[28016.50s -> 28032.29s]  I keep, like, almost accidentally pressing it.
[28032.29s -> 28036.09s]  I need to pick it like a Q or something, because it's so hard for my brain to be like,
[28036.09s -> 28038.91s]  thumb button one.
[28038.91s -> 28040.51s]  And it's like, which one is that?
[28040.51s -> 28042.91s]  Is that the one that's closer to me or the one that's further away?
[28042.91s -> 28044.91s]  And I'm like, thumb button four. Which one is that?
[28044.91s -> 28047.26s]  Is that the one that's closest to me?
[28047.26s -> 28074.38s]  Thank you.
[28074.38s -> 28088.66s]  Stuck again.
[28088.66s -> 28090.06s]  Oh my goodness.
[28090.06s -> 28129.28s]  I was, like, wedged in between all three of their heads.
[28129.28s -> 28137.46s]  I have to leave at least a dollar.
[28137.46s -> 28139.49s]  So, stabbing.
[28139.49s -> 28140.69s]  You have to get it.
[28140.69s -> 28143.64s]  So, let me just make sure I know what's happening here.
[28143.64s -> 28150.13s]  Is it only that tiny little crosshair where you can actually hit?
[28150.13s -> 28153.53s]  Because I feel like I'm trying to hit the blade sort of on them.
[28153.53s -> 28160.18s]  It has to be directly like a little plate fighter for way too long.
[28160.18s -> 28165.10s]  Hey, we'll get a couple bucks.
[28165.10s -> 28183.93s]  That's pretty good.
[28183.93s -> 28185.49s]  14.
[28185.49s -> 28186.98s]  Let's go!
[28186.98s -> 28188.82s]  Oh, I only have 11.
[28188.82s -> 28203.42s]  Alright, last one.
[28203.42s -> 28210.42s]  This is the last one.
[28210.42s -> 28215.20s]  Yep, the demo's on the Steam Playtest demo thing.
[28215.20s -> 28217.91s]  Till the 13th.
[28217.91s -> 28222.86s]  If you want to play it, you've got three and a half days.
[28222.86s -> 28247.97s]  Three days or so.
[28247.97s -> 28248.57s]  No thanks.
[28248.57s -> 28274.66s]  Shit.
[28274.66s -> 28285.40s]  Alright, fighting people on stairs.
[28285.40s -> 28287.56s]  It's just not fun.
[28287.56s -> 28321.86s]  That's better.
[28321.86s -> 28324.46s]  Does the rogue get some kind of self-heal eventually or no?
[28324.46s -> 28344.33s]  Is somebody coming?
[28344.33s -> 28359.40s]  You gonna come down this hall?
[28359.40s -> 28360.40s]  Hmm?
[28360.40s -> 28367.27s]  Wait, yeah!
[28367.27s -> 28369.89s]  They weren't aggro'd before.
[28369.89s -> 28372.07s]  What?
[28372.07s -> 28377.46s]  I didn't even, I walked further away, not closer.
[28377.46s -> 28390.22s]  This sucks.
[28390.22s -> 28391.22s]  Out of the fryer.
[28391.22s -> 28392.82s]  And into the fryer later.
[28392.82s -> 28393.82s]  As they say.
[28393.82s -> 28400.75s]  It's good, bro.
[28400.75s -> 28403.73s]  Out of the fryer later.
[28403.73s -> 28407.67s]  And into the frying pan.
[28407.67s -> 28408.87s]  Hey.
[28408.87s -> 28410.23s]  Need some help?
[28410.23s -> 28412.66s]  If you had a heal, I would be so happy.
[28412.66s -> 28417.35s]  Yeah, I got you, bro.
[28417.35s -> 28418.95s]  Oh my goodness, that's so good.
[28418.95s -> 28420.39s]  You saved my life.
[28420.39s -> 28422.32s]  Here.
[28422.32s -> 28424.21s]  I got you, bro.
[28424.21s -> 28426.41s]  As long as you don't, you know, like stab me in the back or something.
[28426.41s -> 28427.21s]  But you will.
[28427.21s -> 28429.85s]  Thanks, bro.
[28429.85s -> 28435.69s]  So?
[28435.69s -> 28453.25s]  Yeah, we're friendly.
[28453.25s -> 28467.41s]  We're friendly.
[28467.41s -> 28470.81s]  Need all the friends we can get in this dump.
[28470.81s -> 28493.53s]  How the one of you need healing at all?
[28493.53s -> 28495.73s]  Can I have another one?
[28495.73s -> 28497.60s]  I don't want to be greedy.
[28497.60s -> 28498.83s]  I got you.
[28498.83s -> 28499.83s]  Not so good.
[28499.83s -> 28509.50s]  Go.
[28518.71s -> 28519.51s]  Let's try.
[28519.51s -> 28520.51s]  Wait, we're all friendly.
[28520.51s -> 28521.91s]  Let's go kill the main boss guy.
[28521.91s -> 28522.91s]  He's right over here.
[28522.91s -> 28523.91s]  Yes, let's go.
[28523.91s -> 28524.71s]  Let's go.
[28524.71s -> 28526.99s]  Yeah, what are we doing?
[28526.99s -> 28529.99s]  We could also play Duck Duck Goose to see who has to get killed.
[28529.99s -> 28533.49s]  The real boss is down here.
[28533.49s -> 28535.24s]  Jesus fuck.
[28536.04s -> 28537.64s]  It's just, you know, to get by.
[28541.00s -> 28543.78s]  For the guild.
[28543.78s -> 28570.38s]  Oh my God, he's gonna kill me.
[28570.38s -> 28571.38s]  No, I'm fine.
[28579.26s -> 28582.13s]  I've never seen this thing die before.
[28582.13s -> 28583.50s]  What do you have on him?
[28583.50s -> 28584.70s]  Well, sanctuary.
[28584.70s -> 28585.70s]  Come here, come here, come here.
[28585.70s -> 28586.50s]  Purple mace, bro.
[28586.50s -> 28593.52s]  Oh, that's pretty sweet.
[28593.52s -> 28602.01s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[28602.01s -> 28603.01s]  Thanks, bro.
[28603.01s -> 28617.90s]  Some really nice people.
[28617.90s -> 28623.34s]  You take it since you just got a purple thing.
[28623.34s -> 28624.34s]  Yeah, get out of here, man.
[28624.34s -> 28624.94s]  Thanks, bro.
[28624.94s -> 28626.14s]  Take the thing and stash it.
[28626.14s -> 28629.45s]  Does anyone need any extra healing at all before I go?
[28629.45s -> 28632.59s]  All right, I got you.
[28632.59s -> 28633.19s]  Hold on.
[28633.19s -> 28637.54s]  Hot.
[28637.54s -> 28638.14s]  What?
[28638.14s -> 28641.69s]  He's lied.
[28641.69s -> 28643.09s]  Oh my goodness.
[28643.09s -> 28650.38s]  And right when we talked about friends and friendship and companionship.
[28650.38s -> 28652.38s]  Bro's backstabbed.
[28652.38s -> 28655.18s]  I thought you just hit me and I was about to cry.
[28655.18s -> 28661.30s]  There was a spike in the wall.
[28662.10s -> 28662.90s]  Okay.
[28664.90s -> 28665.50s]  Did he die?
[28665.50s -> 28666.10s]  No.
[28666.10s -> 28666.50s]  Okay.
[28666.50s -> 28667.30s]  I thought he died.
[28669.50s -> 28672.74s]  What a dick.
[28672.74s -> 28675.24s]  Guys, I already killed the troll.
[28675.24s -> 28675.64s]  You did?
[28675.64s -> 28677.46s]  Oh, good stuff.
[28677.46s -> 28683.86s]  He looks dead.
[28683.86s -> 28694.46s]  Any scraps?
[28694.46s -> 28695.26s]  You got the purple.
[28695.26s -> 28695.86s]  You should take it.
[28695.86s -> 28697.46s]  And then he just walks in it.
[28697.46s -> 28699.06s]  Oh, I don't know which side it is.
[28699.06s -> 28702.03s]  Anyway, it doesn't matter.
[28702.03s -> 28706.43s]  We got to find you a portal.
[28706.43s -> 28707.83s]  Friends.
[28707.83s -> 28709.43s]  I'm going to open this up.
[28709.43s -> 28711.03s]  The cleric's got to take this.
[28711.03s -> 28712.23s]  We're all going to pick numbers.
[28712.83s -> 28715.83s]  Okay, that works.
[28715.83s -> 28718.23s]  Bro, just fucking run in.
[28718.23s -> 28719.23s]  No, no, no.
[28726.54s -> 28727.74s]  Unfortunate.
[28727.74s -> 28732.55s]  Chill, chill, chill.
[28732.55s -> 28735.95s]  We're all fucked here anyways.
[28735.95s -> 28736.75s]  You be having it.
[28736.75s -> 28739.84s]  How do we get you out of here with that purple?
[28739.84s -> 28741.34s]  I don't know.
[28741.34s -> 28744.74s]  I should probably stop saying that out loud, by the way.
[28744.74s -> 28745.74s]  Yeah, probably.
[28746.74s -> 28750.70s]  Come here.
[28750.70s -> 28753.10s]  It's like I'm trying to get him killed.
[28753.10s -> 28759.40s]  You need to get out of here with that purple.
[28759.40s -> 28762.56s]  I'm trying to be like...
[28762.56s -> 28766.36s]  What?
[28766.36s -> 28768.32s]  Was that him?
[28768.32s -> 28773.10s]  Where is it?
[28773.10s -> 28773.50s]  Where is it?
[28773.50s -> 28774.90s]  I need to give it back to him.
[28774.90s -> 28776.30s]  How did he die?
[28776.30s -> 28777.30s]  What if this is not it?
[28777.30s -> 28778.50s]  Somebody took it.
[28778.50s -> 28779.50s]  Who took that mace?
[28779.50s -> 28780.10s]  Who took that mace?
[28780.10s -> 28782.30s]  I need to know.
[28782.30s -> 28783.10s]  What mace?
[28783.10s -> 28800.34s]  Who took the mace?
[28800.34s -> 28803.67s]  No, I tried.
[28803.67s -> 28806.48s]  I had to get revenge.
[28806.48s -> 28812.34s]  That was so sad.
[28812.34s -> 28816.39s]  That was sad.
[28816.39s -> 28820.16s]  I was sitting there talking to him, and he's dead.
[28820.16s -> 28825.89s]  What killed him?
[28825.89s -> 28827.69s]  That guy was so nice, too.
[28827.69s -> 28828.49s]  He was healing.
[28828.49s -> 28831.29s]  Hey, anybody else need to be topped off?
[28831.29s -> 28832.49s]  Oh, yeah, sure, man.
[28832.49s -> 28833.49s]  I do.
[28833.49s -> 28837.18s]  Oh, yeah, here.
[28837.18s -> 28838.58s]  No good deed.
[28838.58s -> 28852.60s]  It was unfunished, unfortunately.
[28852.60s -> 28855.76s]  Hey, I was trying to tell him to just run in.
[28855.76s -> 28857.52s]  Can't trust anybody.
[28857.52s -> 28869.65s]  You really can't?
[28869.65s -> 28871.05s]  Yeah, a shitload of subs came in.
[28871.05s -> 28873.38s]  Oh, my God.
[28873.38s -> 28874.58s]  I don't really shout subs out.
[28874.58s -> 28877.38s]  I don't shout subs or bits or donations or anything like that out.
[28877.38s -> 28883.74s]  But Jesus, it's completely unnecessary.
[28883.74s -> 28884.94s]  But I appreciate it.
[28884.94s -> 28898.42s]  Thank you.
[28898.42s -> 28900.02s]  Oh, boy, I'm already dead here.
[28900.02s -> 28902.36s]  Not if I go invisible.
[28902.36s -> 28906.53s]  Whatever.
[28906.53s -> 28907.13s]  That one doesn't count?
[28907.13s -> 28907.73s]  No, it doesn't.
[28907.73s -> 28913.57s]  Let me play one more to get the character I know how to play.
[28913.57s -> 28914.77s]  This game is so addicting.
[28914.77s -> 28932.72s]  There's something about it.
[28932.72s -> 28933.72s]  We're getting the comedy run.
[28933.72s -> 28947.45s]  Oh, I think that one was a comedy run.
[28947.45s -> 28948.45s]  Last one, Larry?
[28948.45s -> 28957.67s]  Yeah.
[28957.67s -> 28958.87s]  Can't trust anybody.
[28959.67s -> 28961.07s]  Oh, man.
[28961.07s -> 28962.27s]  It's a cool purple, too.
[28962.27s -> 28966.65s]  And it's like, wow, a cool purple.
[28966.65s -> 28977.66s]  It's not always a bad start.
[28977.66s -> 28978.26s]  Swing.
[28978.26s -> 28979.76s]  Swing.
[28979.76s -> 29010.82s]  Sometimes, man, this game ran away.
[29010.82s -> 29012.82s]  I feel the most safe with Fighter.
[29012.82s -> 29017.37s]  I know it's a default class, but still.
[29017.37s -> 29019.17s]  Are they actually going to put a bard in?
[29019.17s -> 29023.30s]  That'd be fun, actually.
[29023.30s -> 29036.78s]  What?
[29036.78s -> 29038.78s]  They use it now, unfortunately.
[29038.78s -> 29059.23s]  Was the pretzel cross pizza thing actually back,
[29059.23s -> 29060.43s]  or was that person just saying that
[29060.43s -> 29081.73s]  and now just severely pissed me off?
[29081.73s -> 29100.18s]  Got your back.
[29100.18s -> 29112.62s]  Ooh, that's good.
[29112.62s -> 29117.15s]  We could get that middle group.
[29117.15s -> 29122.05s]  Actually, I got to leave.
[29122.05s -> 29128.85s]  Coming soon.
[29128.85s -> 29131.76s]  Want to go for the middle group?
[29131.76s -> 29135.18s]  You think we can take them?
[29135.18s -> 29143.06s]  Think so.
[29143.06s -> 29148.55s]  Oh, my God, that hurt a lot.
[29148.55s -> 29152.36s]  I'm so slow.
[29152.36s -> 29160.30s]  Oh, my God, that's doing so much damage to me.
[29160.30s -> 29177.26s]  We got to loot and get out of here.
[29177.26s -> 29188.08s]  Actually, pick it up and give one of them.
[29188.08s -> 29206.06s]  We got to go.
[29206.06s -> 29208.72s]  I'm going to use the campfire.
[29208.72s -> 29222.12s]  Let's go in a safe place and use the...
[29222.52s -> 29225.36s]  Nowhere else really to do this, and I need it right now.
[29225.36s -> 29248.81s]  We're in the circle.
[29248.81s -> 29254.70s]  Yep.
[29254.70s -> 29273.02s]  Oh, shit.
[29273.02s -> 29285.42s]  Portal somewhere around here.
[29285.42s -> 29313.71s]  Shit went down over here on the portal.
[29313.71s -> 29318.68s]  This is dangerous down here.
[29318.68s -> 29324.67s]  I don't think we want to go down here.
[29324.67s -> 29337.60s]  Yeah, that's just certain death.
[29337.60s -> 29338.20s]  Friendly.
[29338.20s -> 29346.06s]  I'm not one of those backstabbers.
[29346.06s -> 29348.89s]  Oops.
[29348.89s -> 29356.15s]  He's looking around.
[29356.15s -> 29372.75s]  Oh, no.
[29372.75s -> 29374.33s]  Ah, shit.
[29374.33s -> 29375.33s]  I almost did it too.
[29375.33s -> 29376.53s]  Can I have another one of those heels?
[29376.53s -> 29407.58s]  Oh, shit.
[29407.58s -> 29409.78s]  Hey, come take this cabinet.
[29409.78s -> 29425.24s]  You got any more of those heels on you?
[29425.24s -> 29426.04s]  Oh, no.
[29427.04s -> 29428.44s]  We got to fight for this.
[29428.44s -> 29430.71s]  We have to fight for this.
[29430.71s -> 29431.31s]  I'm sorry.
[29431.31s -> 29433.97s]  We have to fight for this.
[29433.97s -> 29439.02s]  Don't we?
[29439.02s -> 29448.20s]  All right, good luck.
[29448.20s -> 29454.62s]  I was willing to do a duel for it.
[29454.62s -> 29455.22s]  You know what I mean?
[29455.22s -> 29457.02s]  If I want to go, you want to go.
[29457.02s -> 29459.42s]  I mean, we could have fought to the death for it, I think.
[29459.42s -> 29478.49s]  And I think that's a fair way to do it.
[29478.49s -> 29479.69s]  Still a clerk?
[29479.69s -> 29486.94s]  Can live a pretty long time in the dust.
[29486.94s -> 29490.48s]  Is there still a portal?
[29490.48s -> 29491.68s]  Oh, there's one right there.
[29491.68s -> 29492.48s]  You got it.
[29492.48s -> 29493.86s]  You got it.
[29493.86s -> 29498.19s]  You got it.
[29498.19s -> 29499.79s]  It's so close.
[29499.79s -> 29501.74s]  Please.
[29501.74s -> 29502.94s]  No.
[29502.94s -> 29504.97s]  Oh, yes.
[29504.97s -> 29505.37s]  All right.
[29505.37s -> 29505.77s]  Good.
[29505.77s -> 29506.17s]  All right.
[29506.17s -> 29507.72s]  We're good.
[29507.72s -> 29508.32s]  Damn.
[29508.32s -> 29509.12s]  Just barely.
[29509.12s -> 29516.28s]  I want to make sure you made it out alive.
[29516.28s -> 29519.45s]  That's a lot of stuff.
[29519.45s -> 29522.86s]  Get rid of it.
[29522.86s -> 29530.49s]  Damn.
[29530.49s -> 29532.55s]  Damn.
[29532.55s -> 29543.08s]  85 gold.
[29543.08s -> 29543.68s]  Nice.
[29543.68s -> 29556.69s]  I'll keep the...
[29556.69s -> 29583.01s]  I got to start collecting kind of middle of the road shitty gear.
[29583.01s -> 29588.80s]  I feel like I just dump everything.
[29588.80s -> 29593.76s]  What's that in the corner?
[29593.76s -> 29598.08s]  It's been like a weird bug.
[29598.08s -> 29599.68s]  I can't like scroll over it.
[29599.68s -> 29601.93s]  Weird.
[29601.93s -> 29602.53s]  It won't let me.
[29602.53s -> 29603.93s]  It's like a little force field or something.
[29603.93s -> 29609.94s]  All right.
[29609.94s -> 29610.74s]  Last one.
[29610.74s -> 29618.58s]  Final one.
[29622.48s -> 29624.08s]  This is truly the final one.
[29624.08s -> 29625.08s]  It's like 2 a.m.
[29625.08s -> 29626.48s]  And I got to eat some more food.
[29626.48s -> 29628.67s]  Oh, well.
[29628.67s -> 29630.07s]  This game really is really fun though.
[29630.07s -> 29632.64s]  Even though I'm not very good at it.
[29632.64s -> 29633.44s]  There's something about it.
[29633.44s -> 29636.78s]  The treachery.
[29636.78s -> 29638.79s]  The companionship.
[29638.79s -> 29639.39s]  There's so much...
[29639.39s -> 29639.79s]  You know what?
[29639.79s -> 29643.69s]  It feels like there's so much heartbreak.
[29643.69s -> 29646.09s]  It feels like every two or three rounds,
[29646.09s -> 29649.92s]  there's a story that's been told.
[29649.92s -> 29650.52s]  It's cool.
[29650.52s -> 29658.40s]  I like it.
[29658.40s -> 29666.13s]  It reminds me of the way people acted in the TF2 days.
[29666.13s -> 29670.20s]  Just that goofy shit that was constantly happening.
[29670.20s -> 29673.40s]  People just randomly RPing for no reason.
[29673.40s -> 29675.70s]  People walking into traps and dying.
[29675.70s -> 29676.90s]  Not the sandwich heavy shit.
[29676.90s -> 29681.02s]  Like it just reminds me of those old days of...
[29681.02s -> 29683.53s]  You kind of never know what's going to happen.
[29683.53s -> 29689.75s]  Which means it's worth playing over and over again.
[29689.75s -> 29693.24s]  And I'll be honest, if anything can scratch that itch again,
[29693.24s -> 29694.04s]  I'm going to play it.
[29694.04s -> 29698.62s]  And that's what's happening.
[29698.62s -> 29701.22s]  I think the guy running in to try to fight the troll.
[29701.22s -> 29701.82s]  Oh, hey, yeah.
[29701.82s -> 29702.82s]  Let's fight it.
[29702.82s -> 29705.22s]  And he dies in one hit.
[29705.22s -> 29708.58s]  That person told a whole story in two minutes.
[29708.58s -> 29721.73s]  It was hilarious.
[29721.73s -> 29723.89s]  You're going to hate this game in a week.
[29723.89s -> 29727.49s]  Well, I won't be able to because it's not going to be playable in a week.
[29727.49s -> 29740.02s]  So getting just enough.
[29740.02s -> 29743.74s]  No, no, no.
[29743.74s -> 29760.63s]  We got to fight.
[29760.63s -> 29762.43s]  How are you still alive, man?
[29762.43s -> 29769.59s]  Come on, dude.
[29769.59s -> 29777.22s]  Archers still right here.
[29777.22s -> 29779.58s]  There's two archers.
[29779.58s -> 29780.98s]  This is bad.
[29780.98s -> 29793.99s]  What?
[29793.99s -> 29808.10s]  I'm so tilted by that that I'm like...
[29808.10s -> 29809.50s]  Two archers.
[29809.50s -> 29811.50s]  You may as well just leave the room.
[29811.50s -> 29816.33s]  Because your opportunity to attack is just gone completely.
[29816.33s -> 29847.26s]  That didn't count.
[29847.26s -> 29859.54s]  This is actually the last one because I'm starting to get like foggy.
[29859.54s -> 29865.11s]  This is not the type of game you play when you're like foggy, tired.
[29865.11s -> 29868.51s]  Oh, this is exactly when I wanted to play and how long I wanted to play.
[29868.51s -> 29869.11s]  Yeah, this is it.
[29869.11s -> 29871.09s]  Let's do it.
[29871.09s -> 29872.49s]  Definitely not bringing this weander out.
[29872.49s -> 29881.92s]  No way.
[29881.92s -> 29884.21s]  Oh, yeah, foggy, foggy.
[29884.21s -> 29898.10s]  It's like I'm looking through a fucking foggy window right now.
[29898.10s -> 29923.58s]  You're going to do this to me twice in a row.
[29923.58s -> 29924.38s]  Don't get overwhelmed.
[29924.38s -> 29930.90s]  They're going to be spawning over and over again, but they're not red.
[29930.90s -> 29944.94s]  Good.
[29944.94s -> 29950.58s]  Coins.
[29950.58s -> 29952.95s]  I would like to get out of here with a bunch of stuff.
[29952.95s -> 29963.89s]  Oh, that's good.
[29963.89s -> 29990.58s]  Very, very nice.
[29990.58s -> 30008.42s]  What on earth are you doing?
[30008.42s -> 30008.82s]  Stop doing that.
[30008.82s -> 30022.72s]  Why is it doing that?
[30022.72s -> 30036.77s]  Let's go.
[30036.77s -> 30038.13s]  Good morning.
[30038.13s -> 30041.03s]  Good morning.
[30041.03s -> 30054.68s]  How are you?
[30054.68s -> 30056.51s]  Who is your daddy?
[30056.51s -> 30089.95s]  And what does he do?
[30089.95s -> 30097.27s]  It's better not be a mimic.
[30097.27s -> 30104.50s]  I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions and I want to have them answered immediately.
[30104.50s -> 30106.40s]  Who is your daddy?
[30106.40s -> 30114.10s]  What does he do?
[30114.10s -> 30132.30s]  Well, I hope you leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to ram it into your stomach.
[30132.30s -> 30141.86s]  Goodbye.
[30141.86s -> 30148.08s]  I heard portal and I would love to find it.
[30148.08s -> 30163.74s]  Was that behind me or this is the place to be to look at?
[30163.74s -> 30166.74s]  Yes, he missed and hit me.
[30166.74s -> 30179.10s]  Shit.
[30179.10s -> 30181.17s]  You fucking around?
[30181.17s -> 30186.54s]  Oh, you are fucking around, aren't you?
[30186.54s -> 30187.54s]  Oh shit, portal down there.
[30187.54s -> 30187.94s]  Fuck.
[30187.94s -> 30189.54s]  I don't care anymore about fighting anybody.
[30189.54s -> 30199.79s]  Portal down.
[30199.79s -> 30201.74s]  I don't want to fight you.
[30201.74s -> 30202.74s]  I don't want to fight you.
[30202.74s -> 30232.36s]  You're shooting arrows at me though.
[30232.36s -> 30254.02s]  Where is it?
[30255.06s -> 30261.14s]  What the fuck was somebody behind me?
[30261.14s -> 30262.94s]  There was a fucking guy behind me.
[30262.94s -> 30265.84s]  It wasn't there.
[30265.84s -> 30267.47s]  I would have had that too.
[30267.47s -> 30277.12s]  Fuck.
[30277.12s -> 30285.94s]  Goblin was hitting me from behind.
[30285.94s -> 30286.74s]  How much damage?
[30286.74s -> 30293.86s]  Did you take more damage from behind?
[30293.86s -> 30296.46s]  I feel like I could have gotten out of that too.
[30296.46s -> 30302.26s]  I tried to jump around, but I bumped into the fucking lamp post and everything is just collision in this game.
[30302.26s -> 30356.13s]  I just fell straight down.
[30356.13s -> 30356.93s]  I don't want to use it.
[30356.93s -> 30425.79s]  That hurt somebody who's behind me right now.
[30425.79s -> 30426.99s]  Okay, I got some pretty good stuff.
[30426.99s -> 30439.23s]  I got to actually hunker down here.
[30439.23s -> 30458.30s]  Why you both have the same animation right now?
[30458.30s -> 30460.98s]  You became an EU streamer.
[30460.98s -> 30461.98s]  Yeah, technically, right?
[30461.98s -> 30487.78s]  No bullshit here.
[30487.78s -> 30497.55s]  That's the secret escape tunnel.
[30497.55s -> 30503.90s]  Are you going to shoot?
[30503.90s -> 30524.23s]  Why are they all acting like this?
[30524.23s -> 30532.72s]  They're scared of me.
[30532.72s -> 30538.52s]  I want to loot this room so bad, but that's not happening.
[30538.52s -> 30543.06s]  I guess maybe I could.
[30543.06s -> 30544.46s]  Oh, you little shit.
[30544.46s -> 30563.06s]  Just die.
[30563.06s -> 30564.86s]  How many hits is this guy going to take?
[30564.86s -> 30569.48s]  I've hit him five times.
[30569.48s -> 30582.02s]  Oh, would you just fuck off already?
[30582.02s -> 30586.06s]  Whatever.
[30586.06s -> 30586.66s]  I heard it.
[30586.66s -> 30588.86s]  Where was it?
[30588.86s -> 30591.02s]  I heard it.
[30591.02s -> 30594.01s]  I don't know where it is though.
[30594.01s -> 30594.51s]  You know what?
[30594.51s -> 30597.44s]  You little fuck face.
[30597.44s -> 30616.75s]  I'm going to enjoy this.
[30616.75s -> 30617.55s]  So much good stuff.
[30617.55s -> 30627.56s]  So much for the tunnel now.
[30627.56s -> 30633.86s]  How do I go through the tunnel?
[30633.86s -> 30635.48s]  Is it just open?
[30635.48s -> 30641.79s]  Wait, I can just leave?
[30641.79s -> 30650.90s]  Did I win?
[30650.90s -> 30652.00s]  Holy shit.
[30652.00s -> 30667.06s]  Yeah.
[30667.06s -> 30668.06s]  It's worth a lot.
[30668.06s -> 30687.73s]  Goodness.
[30687.73s -> 30696.85s]  No, I'll keep these.
[30696.85s -> 30697.85s]  Why do I have this?
[30715.57s -> 30719.10s]  All right, one more.
[30719.10s -> 30724.76s]  I'm going to stab him.
[30724.76s -> 30725.96s]  I'm going to stab him like this.
[30725.96s -> 30726.46s]  I'm going to...
[30726.46s -> 30780.14s]  Tell me if this sounds funny.
[30780.14s -> 30781.14s]  If I kill somebody, I'm going to...
[30781.14s -> 30796.02s]  I have to say that.
[30796.02s -> 30807.07s]  I want to be able to see you.
[30807.07s -> 30808.17s]  Do it when you die.
[30808.17s -> 30808.47s]  Yeah.
[30808.47s -> 30808.97s]  Okay.
[30808.97s -> 30821.96s]  Was it supposed to be a voice filter?
[30821.96s -> 30824.10s]  Yes, there is.
[30824.10s -> 30831.82s]  Can you not hear anything?
[30831.82s -> 30833.48s]  There's not.
[30833.48s -> 30842.68s]  Yeah, you can.
[30842.68s -> 30849.98s]  Hey, you guys are messing with me, right?
[30849.98s -> 30854.55s]  Too subtle.
[30854.55s -> 30856.72s]  How about this?
[30856.72s -> 30886.74s]  Is this subtle enough for you?
[30893.64s -> 30897.28s]  Don't run.
[30897.28s -> 30909.66s]  You've ruined everything because now I can't open the chests.
[30909.66s -> 30916.36s]  Blah.
[30916.36s -> 30917.96s]  Oh, this is very bad too.
[30917.96s -> 30918.92s]  I'm going down.
[30918.92s -> 30923.35s]  Fuck it.
[30923.35s -> 30924.25s]  Not putting up with...
[30924.25s -> 30925.85s]  There's a bug behind me.
[30925.85s -> 30927.89s]  The worst bugs in the game.
[30927.89s -> 30936.96s]  I hate those things so much.
[30936.96s -> 30941.06s]  Dark and darker.
[30941.06s -> 30942.06s]  Oh shit, bro.
[30942.06s -> 30943.46s]  What have you done?
[30943.46s -> 30945.16s]  What did you bring in here?
[30945.16s -> 30946.16s]  Oh.
[30946.16s -> 30947.86s]  Oh my God.
[30947.86s -> 30950.16s]  Oh my God.
[30950.16s -> 30955.95s]  Oh my God.
[30955.95s -> 30959.57s]  Oh shit.
[30959.57s -> 30962.08s]  Oh no.
[30962.08s -> 30962.98s]  All right, I'm going to bed.
[30962.98s -> 30981.88s]  I'm out of here.
[30981.88s -> 31000.32s]  I can't end on that one.
[31000.32s -> 31021.55s]  I wonder what that must have looked like on their screen.
[31021.55s -> 31032.50s]  So many things were buying them.
[31032.50s -> 31070.15s]  Oh, please.
[31070.15s -> 31077.91s]  I feel like I've picked this up a lot.
[31077.91s -> 31081.72s]  You made it through my entire work night.
[31081.72s -> 31082.02s]  Yeah.
[31082.02s -> 31084.87s]  I mean, well, it's not going to be around.
[31084.97s -> 31087.54s]  And I know if I don't get my fill of this,
[31087.54s -> 31114.68s]  I'm going to be disappointed that I didn't.
[31114.68s -> 31119.50s]  Shit going down over there.
[31119.50s -> 31120.90s]  Swing, please.
[31120.90s -> 31157.10s]  Now's the time to bug out.
[31157.10s -> 31174.48s]  You kill one, two more spawn.
[31174.48s -> 31187.30s]  Very nice.
[31187.30s -> 31222.48s]  Hot inside of a pod.
[31222.48s -> 31224.38s]  Double lantern hog.
[31224.38s -> 31234.68s]  Who's breaking those pots up there?
[31234.68s -> 31236.55s]  Stop breaking my pots.
[31236.55s -> 31239.25s]  It's taking me so long to put them in those pots.
[31239.25s -> 31241.72s]  Stop doing that.
[31241.72s -> 31270.23s]  Let's freak that person out.
[31270.23s -> 31279.57s]  Come on.
[31279.57s -> 31280.99s]  Nice.
[31280.99s -> 31281.69s]  Oh my goodness.
[31281.69s -> 31285.09s]  I didn't even realize what was happening.
[31285.09s -> 31287.50s]  I'm taking my sweet ass time here.
[31287.50s -> 31288.10s]  I don't care.
[31288.10s -> 31288.90s]  I want to.
[31288.90s -> 31327.66s]  I'm looting it.
[31327.66s -> 31337.84s]  Fuck you.
[31337.84s -> 31338.94s]  Where is it?
[31338.94s -> 31340.04s]  Fucking just heard it.
[31340.04s -> 31383.77s]  Fucking die.
[31383.77s -> 31384.87s]  Oh my God.
[31384.87s -> 31414.42s]  Why do you have more health than these assholes?
[31414.42s -> 31415.62s]  I wasn't trying to sneak up on you.
[31415.62s -> 31417.02s]  I was trying to go around you because I thought you were going
[31417.02s -> 31417.62s]  to try to kill me.
[31417.62s -> 31418.72s]  So I tried to avoid you.
[31418.72s -> 31465.07s]  There's a portal right now.
[31465.07s -> 31466.07s]  These red spiders.
[31466.07s -> 31472.87s]  They're going to screw everything up for us.
[31472.87s -> 31474.17s]  No.
[31474.17s -> 31477.55s]  Of course.
[31477.55s -> 31480.95s]  Why are they aggro to me the whole time?
[31480.95s -> 31481.85s]  They're aggro to me.
[31482.35s -> 31484.25s]  He's standing still.
[31484.25s -> 31486.85s]  Why are they just running in a circle around me?
[31486.85s -> 31489.58s]  Why did they not attack him?
[31489.58s -> 31497.68s]  What the fuck?
[31497.68s -> 31505.57s]  Where is it?
[31505.57s -> 31506.17s]  Where is it?
[31506.17s -> 31509.39s]  Is it not up right?
[31509.39s -> 31512.06s]  I heard it.
[31512.06s -> 31513.56s]  It's up or down a floor.
[31513.56s -> 31516.98s]  Oh, I hate this shit.
[31516.98s -> 31519.62s]  Because by the time that this stuff spawns,
[31519.62s -> 31521.72s]  you're fucking in the red.
[31521.72s -> 31523.82s]  And everyone's beat up.
[31523.82s -> 31525.16s]  Everyone's happy.
[31525.16s -> 31532.60s]  I thought that was in the person.
[31532.60s -> 31535.12s]  Go down?
[31535.12s -> 31538.52s]  I honestly just don't even know how to go down.
[31538.52s -> 31539.98s]  I'm going to go.
[31539.98s -> 31546.40s]  I heard another one.
[31546.40s -> 31551.43s]  No, I thought it was over here.
[31551.43s -> 31556.54s]  Stay here?
[31556.54s -> 31560.64s]  I mean, I hate that it spawns below you
[31560.64s -> 31562.97s]  and the fucking red circle's already here.
[31562.97s -> 31564.90s]  They've all already spawned.
[31564.90s -> 31574.04s]  God.
[31574.04s -> 31586.92s]  Good luck finding it.
[31586.92s -> 31590.08s]  The fact that there's three levels here,
[31590.08s -> 31593.95s]  at the very end, when there's nowhere to go,
[31593.95s -> 31599.95s]  if one spawns above or below, it just fucks you.
[31599.95s -> 31601.45s]  Too many layers.
[31601.45s -> 31620.76s]  Too many layers.
[31620.76s -> 31622.26s]  I was going to win that one, too.
[31622.26s -> 31622.86s]  You know what?
[31622.86s -> 31625.34s]  No, I'm not being nice anymore.
[31625.34s -> 31627.84s]  I'm just killing anyone I come across.
[31627.84s -> 31632.21s]  To be fair, though, I wasn't being nice.
[31632.21s -> 31634.41s]  I was genuinely afraid of that guy.
[31634.41s -> 31638.88s]  It's different.
[31638.88s -> 31641.08s]  Running around in circles with these two spiders.
[31641.08s -> 31645.88s]  And this guy's just like, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[31645.88s -> 31647.18s]  Nothing even attacks him.
[31647.18s -> 31647.78s]  I'm running around.
[31647.78s -> 31657.57s]  I got these spiders chasing my ass.
[31657.57s -> 31674.09s]  That guy wrote a whole book report.
[31674.09s -> 31675.29s]  Nope.
[31675.29s -> 31705.18s]  That's not happening.
[31705.18s -> 31706.08s]  Whoa!
[31706.08s -> 31707.88s]  That actually scared the shit out of me.
[31707.88s -> 31708.98s]  My whole body hurts.
[31708.98s -> 31710.18s]  I thought that was a player.
[31710.18s -> 31715.63s]  Goodness.
[31715.63s -> 31716.13s]  Please.
[31721.98s -> 31725.08s]  Did I even aggro this many monsters?
[31725.08s -> 31727.98s]  When did that happen?
[31727.98s -> 31729.08s]  Oh, it's over.
[31729.08s -> 31730.18s]  Oh, come on.
[31730.18s -> 31731.28s]  I can't go out on that.
[31731.28s -> 31737.64s]  That sucked.
[31737.64s -> 31740.50s]  God damn it.
[31740.50s -> 31744.52s]  I mean, maybe if I just keep walking them around.
[31744.52s -> 31747.64s]  Where are they all coming from?
[31747.64s -> 31751.34s]  The whole fucking floor is aggro'd to me.
[31751.34s -> 31773.95s]  What the hell?
[31777.02s -> 31778.62s]  All right, no matter what, this is the last one.
[31778.62s -> 31782.05s]  Is it?
[31782.05s -> 31787.13s]  This is the last one.
[31787.13s -> 31790.51s]  If this is not the last game, because I need to go to bed.
[31790.51s -> 31796.70s]  If this is not the last game, then I will eat a pair of shoes on camera.
[31796.70s -> 31798.40s]  The last game for tonight.
[31798.40s -> 31799.10s]  The last game for tonight.
[31799.10s -> 31800.60s]  I'm going to play again probably on Friday.
[31800.60s -> 31804.43s]  I mean, just for this period right now, this stream right now,
[31804.43s -> 31806.53s]  I will eat a pair of shoes on camera if this is not the last one,
[31806.53s -> 31807.23s]  because I got to go to bed.
[31807.23s -> 31808.03s]  But I love this game.
[31808.03s -> 31808.33s]  It's fun.
[31808.33s -> 31808.63s]  Don't worry.
[31808.63s -> 31809.13s]  I'll be fine.
[31809.13s -> 31809.73s]  Don't worry about me.
[31809.73s -> 31810.93s]  Worry about yourself.
[31810.93s -> 31811.33s]  What are you doing?
[31811.33s -> 31812.43s]  You okay?
[31812.43s -> 31859.60s]  Things going all right?
[31859.60s -> 31861.40s]  The game lagged a little.
[31861.40s -> 31873.79s]  You saw what happened.
[31873.79s -> 31875.79s]  Elderly man in Las Vegas.
[31875.79s -> 31880.96s]  He won't go to bed.
[31880.96s -> 31886.44s]  Final attack.
[31886.44s -> 31894.32s]  I didn't even want to aggro these and now I have to fight him.
[31894.32s -> 31895.42s]  All right, please just leave me alone.
[31895.42s -> 31896.32s]  I'm going to close the door.
[31896.32s -> 31919.13s]  Whatever.
[31919.13s -> 31921.69s]  He was just acting weird.
[31921.69s -> 31933.57s]  He was just acting weird.
[31933.57s -> 31933.87s]  What?
[31933.87s -> 31942.31s]  Oh, well, come on then.
[31942.31s -> 31962.30s]  You're going to come down here then come over here.
[31962.30s -> 31964.97s]  You got to be kidding me.
[31964.97s -> 31965.97s]  Oh my goodness.
[31965.97s -> 31968.08s]  This is bad.
[31968.08s -> 31992.40s]  This is very bad.
[31992.40s -> 31993.70s]  Stupid.
[31993.70s -> 31994.70s]  You're stupid.
[31994.70s -> 32016.86s]  You're stupid.
[32016.86s -> 32021.02s]  Do I just eat the pair of shoes and not even care?
[32021.02s -> 32023.90s]  Shit.
[32023.90s -> 32024.40s]  All right.
[32024.40s -> 32024.80s]  All right.
[32024.80s -> 32025.10s]  All right.
[32025.10s -> 32025.40s]  I'm out.
[32025.40s -> 32025.60s]  I'm out.
[32025.60s -> 32031.51s]  I'll see you later.
[32031.51s -> 32032.21s]  It's fun.
[32032.21s -> 32032.81s]  It's fun.
[32032.81s -> 32037.21s]  It's fun.
[32037.21s -> 32038.64s]  It's fun.
[32038.64s -> 32047.55s]  I still think this is too hard though.
[32047.55s -> 32053.11s]  I love it.
[32053.11s -> 32062.44s]  No fun didn't for you.
[32062.44s -> 32063.54s]  I want to do this.
[32063.54s -> 32071.94s]  I this is so stressful, but I want to do it.
[32071.94s -> 32077.68s]  Part of me feels like you gear up here and you take your gear here,
[32077.68s -> 32080.48s]  but I almost feel like I could play here without needing being being
[32080.48s -> 32084.66s]  able to be geared because you need to be kind of geared for this.
[32084.66s -> 32102.55s]  I went to sleep and you're still streaming.
[32102.55s -> 32105.73s]  Show stash.
[32105.73s -> 32105.93s]  Right.
[32105.93s -> 32108.03s]  Let me make some people very happy, right?
[32108.03s -> 32113.08s]  No, no, no, no.
[32113.08s -> 32115.18s]  I like my stray gold coins.
[32115.18s -> 32124.30s]  One more.
[32124.30s -> 32127.20s]  No, I just thought I was going to eat a pair of shoes if I did one more
[32127.20s -> 32233.90s]  and I yeah, I'm very tired.
[32233.90s -> 32283.03s]  Oh my elbow.
[32283.03s -> 32284.23s]  I was going to smell it.
[32284.23s -> 32291.65s]  Fuck you.
[32291.65s -> 32294.95s]  Just so anytime I open my stash people just like whoa, dude.
[32294.95s -> 32320.08s]  What is going on with you?
[32320.08s -> 32320.78s]  I'm going to bed.
[32320.78s -> 32321.76s]  I'll see you later.
[32321.76s -> 32322.26s]  I'm going to bed.
[32322.26s -> 32330.94s]  I was going to write a huge you.
[32330.94s -> 32333.02s]  Well, now I got to fix it.
[32333.02s -> 32335.12s]  Let me fix it.
[32335.12s -> 32340.84s]  Is there an auto corrected like an auto stash button?
[32340.84s -> 32342.16s]  Waiter.
[32342.16s -> 32342.66s]  All right.
[32342.66s -> 32344.24s]  I'll see you later.
[32344.24s -> 32344.74s]  Yeah.
[32344.74s -> 32345.74s]  I'm out.
[32345.74s -> 32349.14s]  Take care.
[32349.14s -> 32354.06s]  Thanks for watching everybody.
[32354.06s -> 32369.09s]  See you guys on Friday for more.
[32369.09s -> 32374.03s]  And then I think what's probably on Saturday or Sunday,
[32374.03s -> 32376.74s]  unless I don't know.
[32376.74s -> 32379.59s]  Ster and I were planning on doing some Elden Ring,
[32379.59s -> 32393.51s]  but you know, who knows?
[32393.51s -> 32396.12s]  It'll be dark and darker again.
[32396.12s -> 32397.92s]  Ster is going to be very upset if he hears that.
[32397.92s -> 32401.73s]  Don't tell him that.
[32401.83s -> 32402.33s]  Hey, dude.
[32402.33s -> 32405.91s]  Jerma was talking about how he wanted to maybe play dark and
[32405.91s -> 32408.56s]  darker instead on like Sunday.
[32408.56s -> 32418.70s]  Don't tell him that.
[32418.70s -> 32420.50s]  No, we probably we all jokes aside.
[32420.50s -> 32422.10s]  We probably will do Elden Ring.
[32422.10s -> 32422.70s]  I don't know.
[32422.70s -> 32424.20s]  Maybe Ster gets into it.
[32424.20s -> 32424.70s]  We'll see.
[32424.70s -> 32425.80s]  So everything's all up in the air.
[32425.80s -> 32429.12s]  Everything's good, but that's going to be it.
[32429.12s -> 32430.63s]  Thanks for watching everybody.
[32430.63s -> 32434.13s]  See you guys on Friday starting kind of probably around this
[32434.13s -> 32436.83s]  maybe a little bit earlier defending but probably around
[32436.83s -> 32440.53s]  the same time kind of a night streamer.
[32440.53s -> 32443.21s]  Now, I really like it.
[32443.21s -> 32446.06s]  I like this schedule.
[32446.16s -> 32447.66s]  I know a lot of people are not going to be happy to hear
[32447.66s -> 32457.96s]  that, but yeah, that was a lot of fun Friday going to try
[32457.96s -> 32460.15s]  to cycle in some other people.
[32460.15s -> 32463.86s]  I know Italics mentioned he kind of wanted to play it.
[32463.86s -> 32467.75s]  I was kind of pinging people to see me and Will.
[32467.75s -> 32470.19s]  Me and Will Neff were talking about it to try to find the
[32470.19s -> 32470.99s]  right opportunity to play.
[32470.99s -> 32476.05s]  Maybe he's very good people.
[32476.05s -> 32481.43s]  So also if poke wants to play like I would play with poke
[32481.43s -> 32483.53s]  and a lot of people are playing this right now.
[32483.53s -> 32486.66s]  So obviously want to try to jump around and play as many
[32486.66s -> 32487.26s]  people as I can.
[32487.26s -> 32514.64s]  Well, it's while it's live gonna be a lot of credits.
[32514.64s -> 32515.34s]  Oh shit.
[32515.34s -> 32515.94s]  Oh my god.
[32515.94s -> 32518.94s]  Yeah, all the all the subs from Ashley.
[32519.24s -> 32524.69s]  Yeah, I don't those of you that don't know.
[32524.69s -> 32526.59s]  I don't shout out subs anymore.
[32528.63s -> 32530.43s]  I really appreciate anybody that subs to this channel,
[32530.43s -> 32535.55s]  but there are a lot of people on Twitch on YouTube,
[32535.55s -> 32535.95s]  whatever.
[32538.47s -> 32540.57s]  I think your sub would probably better used on them.
[32544.79s -> 32545.79s]  I do appreciate the support.
[32545.79s -> 32550.10s]  I know it's some it's crazy to see that kind of support
[32550.10s -> 32553.04s]  but there's definitely a lot of people on this platform
[32553.04s -> 32565.03s]  that you should be given that to but I appreciate it.
[32565.03s -> 32567.83s]  People are already in pokes chat telling you want to play
[32567.83s -> 32568.43s]  LOL.
[32570.00s -> 32571.90s]  That's how this that's how the streamers communicate.
[32571.90s -> 32576.42s]  You know streamer one says, oh, yeah, that would be fun.
[32576.42s -> 32579.32s]  And then streamer ones chat goes to streamer twos chat
[32579.52s -> 32584.16s]  immediately saying let's go that's how it works.
[32587.99s -> 32589.79s]  Yeah, we communicate through proxy.
[32589.79s -> 32590.29s]  That's true.
[32596.55s -> 32599.45s]  This game sucks play Steve Jackson sorcery the greatest
[32599.45s -> 32602.05s]  game ever made in the history of mankind.
[32602.90s -> 32620.47s]  This game definitely does not suck.
[32620.67s -> 32621.67s]  Please finish sorcery.
[32622.60s -> 32625.97s]  Yeah, I know once some of this new stuff dies down.
[32625.97s -> 32636.03s]  There'll be a lot of stuff to just jump into was last time
[32636.03s -> 32640.19s]  we felt this way about a game maybe Fistful of Frags
[32644.76s -> 32647.34s]  Elden Ring Bloodborne.
[32647.44s -> 32649.04s]  I mean if you're talking about multiplayer games and
[32649.04s -> 32657.76s]  Fistful of Frags is probably the last one I would tell
[32657.76s -> 32660.16s]  I think Fistful of Frags is one of the best FPS is to
[32660.16s -> 32663.24s]  ever be made that game was so unbelievably fun.
[32666.34s -> 32672.34s]  I've said that on camera before that's one of the best
[32672.34s -> 32689.19s]  FPS is playing Fistful of Frags when you got that
[32690.50s -> 32693.90s]  that 007 Golden Eye Golden Gun the thing that killed
[32693.90s -> 32697.52s]  people in one shot, but it was super slow.
[32697.96s -> 32701.69s]  It was ba-boom, ba-boom.
[32702.74s -> 32704.14s]  I loved that weapon.
[32704.34s -> 32704.94s]  You found it.
[32704.94s -> 32706.94s]  It had six bullets in it Walker.
[32706.94s -> 32707.34s]  Yep.
[32709.60s -> 32710.50s]  Maybe we'll play that too.
[32710.90s -> 32712.67s]  Some point that game is so good.
[32718.94s -> 32719.24s]  Don't worry.
[32719.24s -> 32720.74s]  I'm going to send more to smaller streamers.
[32720.74s -> 32721.24s]  Oh hell.
[32721.24s -> 32721.54s]  Yeah.
[32722.31s -> 32728.11s]  Good to know also take care of yourself too, though.
[32730.57s -> 32732.47s]  I don't know what your financial situation looks like
[32732.47s -> 32735.70s]  and I'm not going to pretend to but take care of yourself
[32735.70s -> 32736.00s]  too.

[32779.42s -> 32782.20s]  around and they we kind of filled out and we had two
[32782.20s -> 32785.82s]  different separate groups going so try to get a few
