[1.14s -> 8.10s]  Hey, the title sucks. Yeah, I know. I just, I don't know anything about this game.
[8.10s -> 11.86s]  So I don't know how to title this game. I know it's about you're in space.
[12.66s -> 15.61s]  You start, you look, you're searching. I don't know anything about the game.
[16.17s -> 20.49s]  Just searching around space. You're yearning want to, I don't know, whatever it's staying. I don't care.
[24.04s -> 27.56s]  Uh, I know that, I know that this is a very spoiler filled video game.
[28.44s -> 34.12s]  So I'm going to do my best to not pay attention to chat. It's gonna be really hard for me to do that.
[35.30s -> 39.86s]  And we'll be talking to pre stream chat about how, oh dude, just put it in sub only.
[40.58s -> 45.14s]  Well, um, I'm not sure that's going to do very much considering that almost all of you
[45.86s -> 50.50s]  at this point are subscribed to the channel. Uh, there's almost 11,000 subs on this channel.
[50.50s -> 54.82s]  So all I would do would be flipping a switch that doesn't have a light bulb plugged in.
[55.86s -> 58.58s]  Maybe that's it. Let's, let's, let's turn the lights on for this one.
[59.30s -> 61.54s]  Oh, there's no bulb in there, but I flipped the switch.
[62.42s -> 72.60s]  So we're just going to let it, we're going to let it ride. Let it ride. Uh, I'm going to try to not
[72.60s -> 76.74s]  look too far into what people are saying. I'm going to just, I did a wink.
[77.38s -> 93.67s]  Good. I can see that. I can actually see a real one. All right. Uh, $50 from five.
[94.87s -> 101.99s]  Can we, okay. I'm going to rename you phylactery 50. Phylactery 50 is your new name because you
[101.99s -> 111.29s]  give $50 or more every single stream. You are, you've got, you've got money to spend
[111.93s -> 118.41s]  and I cannot believe you still give this much money. It's unbelievable. I can't believe it.
[118.41s -> 124.34s]  Thank you phylactery lich for the 5,000 bits. I'm actually going to get my, uh,
[124.34s -> 130.73s]  my better dashboard here. Uh, this is the way to play outer wilds today. I was going to do
[130.73s -> 134.65s]  Tony Hawk's underground, but, uh, we're going to have to move Tony Hawk's underground because I
[134.65s -> 140.49s]  needed an official Xbox 360 hard drive. It's been ordered. It just, you can't get it anywhere. I
[140.49s -> 145.21s]  can't get anywhere in real life. So I have to buy it online. So it's got a ship that we're going
[145.21s -> 149.77s]  to do that at the end of the week. I actually have a full plan for the rest of this week.
[149.77s -> 155.48s]  If you believe it, but phylactery, uh, said with his 5,000 bit donations. Hey,
[155.48s -> 160.84s]  Jerma played the DLC for a service wrath or I'll eat a delicious Caesar salad. Good stream last
[160.84s -> 164.60s]  night. Hope you enjoyed the game. Yeah, that's the plan. That's in the plan. You guys ready
[164.60s -> 174.10s]  for the plan? Here is the plan today. Outer wilds. No, not outer worlds, outer wilds.
[175.74s -> 182.65s]  This is a different game than the one you think it is. Maybe tomorrow outer wilds. Uh,
[182.65s -> 188.78s]  this game is apparently what 10, 12 hours long. We could probably split this into two, like six,
[188.78s -> 195.29s]  seven hour streams, something like that after that. So that's today and tomorrow for you,
[195.29s -> 202.15s]  it's going to be 20. Well, we'll see if we can do it in two, but today and tomorrow,
[202.15s -> 208.10s]  out of wilds, Friday, Tony Hawk's underground. I'll have the hard drive by then Tony Hawk's
[208.10s -> 211.62s]  underground. It can be done in one stream. I'm certain of it. Cause I remember playing it
[212.95s -> 220.54s]  Saturday Diablo to hardcore. Going after Diablo with our skeleton necromancer,
[221.18s -> 225.59s]  depending on how long that stream goes, possibly a sir's wrath DLC.
[226.74s -> 234.73s]  Now I also want to address this as well. Uh, the get well card I'd like to experience by myself.
[235.45s -> 238.89s]  I looked into it a little bit and that's something that I don't think I would like to stream.
[239.53s -> 248.42s]  I want to experience it on my own. Uh, it seems a little personal for me, so I definitely want to
[248.42s -> 258.50s]  over the next few nights do it on my own. Thank you everybody that's contributed. I'm not just
[258.50s -> 263.59s]  saying this. I'm actually going to go through every single slide over the next three or four
[263.59s -> 275.59s]  nights. So thank you again, but I do want to experience it on my own. The what a ton of
[275.59s -> 281.05s]  people contributed to a get well card for me, which is insane because I've had been having
[281.05s -> 286.73s]  some stupid, annoying, uh, medical problems with some rib cage bullshit and people are nice enough
[286.73s -> 295.00s]  to want to come together and do that. So thank you all of you. I will be experiencing it over
[295.00s -> 303.85s]  the next few nights. Uh, we had another $50 come in right now. 5,000 bits from AB Joe,
[305.14s -> 311.94s]  5,000 from phylactery, 5,000 from AB Joe. I always thought that the German Merc was wearing a scarf
[311.94s -> 318.17s]  or something. After looking at it on mobile, he just has a really weird chin. Well, it's Mercury.
[323.16s -> 332.12s]  It's just Thanos, but that's the plan for the remainder of the week. Should be some interesting
[332.12s -> 336.44s]  stuff here. I have not, I've outer wilds is one of those games. Remember we're,
[336.44s -> 341.96s]  we're fulfilling our quota on this stream of, I'm playing a game that came out within the last year.
[342.92s -> 347.24s]  We have to fulfill that quote. I've got to play at least one recent game for every 10 old games.
[348.28s -> 361.91s]  You know, another link just come in. We're going to start to see a lot more of these
[363.02s -> 372.01s]  play devil may cry five. Oh fuck sake. I probably will, but we're going to do outer wilds. Let's
[372.01s -> 376.25s]  just move on to it. Let's go. I'm ready to go. Hopefully you're ready to go. Hopefully you've
[376.25s -> 383.34s]  got like a snack or something or something out of wilds. Now I got to remake sure I read it. I'm
[383.34s -> 390.78s]  going to re re re re iterate this again. I, I'm just going to kind of experience this game. I'm
[390.78s -> 396.14s]  not going to be paying too much attention to chat because I've been told, um, I can spoil
[396.14s -> 401.42s]  like the last season of this show in one sentence, right? So like, I got to be careful and please,
[402.06s -> 406.54s]  we're not going to do sub only, but just know that, you know, if you, if you, you know,
[406.54s -> 411.90s]  you drop a fucking spoiler line here, you're out, you're gone. Like you're gone. You're out.
[411.90s -> 420.46s]  So we're, uh, I can't, I'm not going to put it in emote only. Don't ignore me.
[422.18s -> 433.19s]  Another wink come in? No. Wait, what? No, only what? Yeah. Another one just came in. What the
[433.19s -> 440.20s]  fuck? I'm just going to keep this up for a minute because I feel like we're going to get like a
[440.20s -> 450.41s]  shitload of these. Another one. No, I got, I actually have it up on my dashboard. I can see
[450.41s -> 459.24s]  when they're fake. Let's get started. Uh, I've been told that this is one of the best games of the
[459.24s -> 465.30s]  year from last year. I'm curious. I want to know why I'm playing with the controller, by the way,
[466.02s -> 472.70s]  I've heard the music's good. I've heard the game is good. I heard it's really fun. Really interesting
[473.74s -> 493.14s]  outer wilds. Are we ready? You're in normie normie loading. This is weird.
[493.94s -> 497.82s]  This game needs a controller to be good. Uh, I got one in my hands right now.
[500.98s -> 526.14s]  Wake up. Is it, is it FPS? Oh, it is FPS. Talk to slate. Roast a marshmallow. We're doing that
[526.14s -> 547.98s]  first. Oh, God damn it. I've ruined it. Although you got to go all in. Yeah. Oops. If you end up
[547.98s -> 553.90s]  lighting it on fire, you got to go all in and then you, you pull the charcoal mess off the top and
[553.90s -> 574.23s]  you eat it. No, I wanted to eat it. Why am I so bad at this? I get so obsessive compulsive when
[574.23s -> 580.74s]  it comes to roasting marshmallows. Every single centimeter of this whole thing has to be a golden
[580.74s -> 585.78s]  brown or you go all in and you burn the fuck out of it. It lights on fire. And then like I said,
[585.78s -> 594.01s]  you peel it off like that. You let it burn, blow it out, pull off the weird exoskeleton that's on
[594.01s -> 599.61s]  it, eat the exoskeleton and suck on the fucking juices inside. All right. That was good. Let's go
[601.72s -> 609.48s]  There's already more gameplay than yesterday's stream. There's our pilot back from your pre-launch
[610.12s -> 615.82s]  campout under the stars I see. So it's launch day. It seems like only yesterday you joined the space
[615.82s -> 621.58s]  program and suddenly here you are leaving on your first solo voyage. What do you say? Ready to get
[621.58s -> 629.14s]  this beauty off the ground? It's all fueled up and ready to go. Uh, you sure you fixed the retro
[629.14s -> 635.03s]  rockets? That was only a problem one time and then maybe a few times after that. But hey, no reason
[635.03s -> 640.23s]  to dwell on the past, right? Anyway, you'll need to get the launch codes from Hornfels at the
[640.23s -> 644.07s]  observatory before you can lift off. Just bring those here once you said your goodbyes or whatever.
[645.03s -> 665.64s]  Right to the point. I like it. Launch codes from Hornfels. Okay. Requires launch codes. Oh shit.
[666.44s -> 683.27s]  Uh, can I have a jump, a hold and release? That's kind of weird. Holy shit.
[683.35s -> 693.26s]  Fly model ship? Wait a minute. Hold on. Hey. Hey, it's you. Slate said you're blasting off
[693.26s -> 697.42s]  on your ship today. I'm really excited to see the launch. Aren't you going to go into space?
[697.42s -> 703.37s]  Aren't you? You better not have changed your mind. Uh, I want to practice before I leave. Oh, you're
[703.37s -> 705.93s]  just saying that. But if you really want to practice, I guess I could help you. I need,
[705.93s -> 710.65s]  I can learn how to fly. Try to land on one of the geyser pools. Show me what you got.
[711.29s -> 728.09s]  Am I in it? I'm in this? Okay. That's not as easy as I thought it was going to be.
[731.91s -> 754.95s]  How do I drive it? How do you fly? Up, down thrust, horizontal thrust. Guys, I'm not,
[754.95s -> 769.18s]  I don't think I can do this. Horizontal, like you go forward. It's going, it's like doing way too
[769.18s -> 776.02s]  much thrust. You know what I'm saying? It's going like a, it's going too fast. It's less than four
[776.02s -> 791.02s]  buttons, Jerma. I, okay. How do you turn? Okay. I'm serious. I don't understand this. You're
[791.02s -> 799.53s]  thrusting too fast. It's, it's, is it pressure sensitive? I mean, I'm holding it down kind of.
[800.33s -> 854.97s]  Was I not supposed to do that? And then the geyser. Is it my Xbox controller that's doing
[854.97s -> 860.71s]  it so much? It's like, I'm trying not to do too much pressure, but my Xbox one control is
[860.71s -> 877.22s]  a lot like blowing it out. I did it. I did it. Okay. That's I'm done, right? Leave. Okay. No,
[877.22s -> 883.90s]  I got it. I guess I, I guess I kind of understand. Wow. That was just like the time the external
[883.90s -> 888.54s]  fuel tanks exploded on reentry. You'll be okay flying the big one, right? I hope so.
[889.26s -> 901.06s]  I don't know. You tell me. What is this? It's Corfi. Hey yo, Hatchling. I hear you're leaving
[901.06s -> 905.62s]  us to seek adventure amongst the stars. When you return, let's you, me, and Gawson open up a bottle
[905.62s -> 910.26s]  of that good stuff. I'm only seeking adventure amongst one star. Actually other stars are too
[910.26s -> 916.34s]  far away. Good stuff is less delicious sap wine and more daunting digestive challenge.
[916.34s -> 927.08s]  That's pretty funny. That looks like you. No, this, this guy looks like, you know, those images
[927.08s -> 931.24s]  that hurt your head when you put two eyes underneath somebody like you have humans eyes
[931.24s -> 934.20s]  and it's like that weird image where they have four eyes and it hurts your head looking at it.
[938.62s -> 943.58s]  That's what I see. An iron stomach is the mark of a true Parthian, my friend, our hardy hunter
[943.58s -> 947.50s]  gatherer lifestyle stem from the trial and error of which I mean our ancestors survived eating a
[947.50s -> 956.25s]  lot of bad things. All right, let's go. Where's my ship? There's a lot of people. You're actually
[956.25s -> 960.81s]  blasting off in that thing, huh? I told my odds of survival is statistically quite high.
[961.45s -> 965.29s]  Yeah, the space program certainly come a long way. I should probably thank you for causing fewer
[965.29s -> 968.89s]  flash fires than your predecessors. By the way, good luck with those retro rockets.
[970.09s -> 974.60s]  All right, for a second, I thought that was a something bad happening.
[975.48s -> 982.34s]  Outer Wilds adventures presents postcards from orbit. Use satellite camera. This projector is
[982.34s -> 988.10s]  linked to our sky shutter satellite, which is currently orbiting timber hearth. The satellite
[988.10s -> 992.10s]  is equipped with two onboard cameras. See if you can take a snapshot of our village.
[993.22s -> 1026.74s]  Where's the village? Oh, there's a geyser, right? Am I doing this wrong? All right,
[1026.74s -> 1042.12s]  there's a village right here, right? That's us. All right, cool. I got it. That's cool. All right,
[1042.12s -> 1051.30s]  moving on. What do you sell maps? Marl. So it's launch day. How's going to miss you? Speaking of
[1051.30s -> 1054.58s]  launch day, I was thinking about it in the platform. Those ships launched from is getting old.
[1054.58s -> 1059.78s]  Isn't it about time you built a new, less flammable one? That big tree in the village
[1059.78s -> 1066.22s]  would be perfect choice. I wouldn't mind helping the space program. Just say the word. Launch pad
[1066.22s -> 1070.86s]  is flammable? Ah, you didn't realize that. Don't worry. It's held up for the launches so far. It'll
[1070.86s -> 1081.34s]  definitely be fine for yours probably. Oh, it's the guy with the guitar. Hello there, space cadet. I
[1081.34s -> 1085.18s]  hear you're leaving the crater today. If you meet any of the other travelers up there, remind them
[1085.18s -> 1090.30s]  to take proper care of their instruments, won't you? What are the instruments? Oh, sure. I made
[1090.30s -> 1094.94s]  all their instruments, you know. Let me see. There's church drums, Rybex banjo, and Gabro's
[1094.94s -> 1102.92s]  flute. And Feldspar's harmonica, of course. Though Feldspar's been missing for a long time. Sometimes
[1102.92s -> 1107.32s]  it feels like yesterday they were playing their harmonica around the campfire. Anyway, you hear
[1107.32s -> 1112.20s]  music in space. That'll be one of the space program's other travelers. If you feel like
[1112.20s -> 1120.42s]  company, you can always pull out your signal scope and track them down. All right, let's get those
[1120.42s -> 1131.50s]  launch codes. So many people to talk to. What are you guys listening to? Hello, astronaut. If it
[1131.50s -> 1136.30s]  isn't my favorite troublemaker, what's with the radio? We wanted to play hide and seek, but
[1136.30s -> 1140.30s]  Moiraine won't let us borrow their signal scope because it's really delicate and I'm not supposed
[1140.30s -> 1146.89s]  to be thrown around like that. Hey, can we use your signal scope? Can we? Can we please? Sure,
[1146.89s -> 1152.65s]  let's play. Well, okay. Here it's like a tutorial. Galena and me will hide with these radios and you
[1152.65s -> 1157.37s]  will use your signal scope to find us. Last one to be found wins. Okay, close your eyes.
[1158.25s -> 1168.73s]  I'm gonna open up. My money's gonna be gone. All right. Frequency. Change frequency. Zoom in.
[1178.20s -> 1190.01s]  Unknown. Isn't this the person playing the guitar? No, it's up there. How do I get up there?
[1192.54s -> 1213.77s]  Shoot and add an NPC. I don't think so. Is this game dark? It's like the darks are too dark and
[1213.77s -> 1221.46s]  the lights aren't light enough for my screen. I don't know why. All right. Can I get up there?
[1221.46s -> 1240.70s]  Jump. All right. Found you. Got you. You found me. I did. Now, where's the other one? I get how this
[1240.70s -> 1251.98s]  works. Is there fall damage or anything? No. Up and down in here and then go. Can I die?
[1252.86s -> 1280.86s]  Where are you? Like under the waterfall? I don't understand. Not there apparently. No. It's gonna
[1280.86s -> 1292.02s]  be up here. Oh, there you are. This shit is dark. You got me, but I'm the last one. I win.
[1292.02s -> 1294.82s]  I promise you'll play a game when you get back to the space. Okay, gotta go.
[1300.28s -> 1306.87s]  Me too. Let's get those coats. Should I or is it just this kind of personal area that's dark?
[1314.34s -> 1322.06s]  Don't. Okay. All right. What the hell was that? Use camera. There's so many gadgets.
[1323.02s -> 1339.70s]  What are all these gadgets? What was that? Hi, astronaut. You know the patch of ghost matter
[1339.70s -> 1344.18s]  inside this fence? Ghosts said it used to be bigger when they were hatchets because ghost
[1344.18s -> 1350.34s]  matter evaporates. It just takes a super long time to go away. There's still ghost matter in
[1350.34s -> 1356.22s]  the village when I'm grown up. Ghost matter is awesome. You shouldn't be throwing rocks in there.
[1356.22s -> 1360.78s]  It's dangerous. Obviously, that's what makes it so awesome. Geez, I'm not dumb enough to touch it.
[1360.78s -> 1370.98s]  Oh, you're such a grown up. Yes, I am. I don't throw rocks and stuff. I saw smoke coming from
[1370.98s -> 1374.42s]  Young Bark Crater up north and figured I should go check it out. You can use the scout launcher.
[1374.42s -> 1387.85s]  Just please don't break it while I'm gone. Scout launcher, launch scout. What the fuck is going on?
[1389.46s -> 1397.93s]  Okay, so I get a fire. This is a cannon camera. Oh, it's still flying. Oh, shit.
[1398.89s -> 1408.65s]  All right. Get it back. I want to see what I look like. Hold on. What do I look like?
[1412.26s -> 1424.25s]  That's me, right? No, that's cool. Where are those coats? Gotta go to the observatory. Birds
[1424.25s -> 1442.23s]  fly. Sun shines. All right. This way. Why does this remind me of Firewatch?
[1444.42s -> 1448.90s]  The walking with the acoustic guitar in the background is just... I'm waiting for the radio
[1448.90s -> 1464.89s]  to come up. All right. I'm going the wrong way. Big bits just came in. Oh, shit. They did.
[1465.53s -> 1478.47s]  You're right. Hold on. I just missed it. All right. Here we go. Whoa. Dude, it's bright. It's
[1478.47s -> 1483.19s]  really bright now. Oh, because the sun is coming up. All right. Now I get it. I get it. All right.
[1483.19s -> 1491.82s]  Yeah. Sun. Sunshine. All right. Hold on. Parfale Mule gave 5044 bits. Thank you, Parfale Mule.
[1492.46s -> 1497.35s]  50 bucks. This might be the only time I ever donate so many bits at once since I can by no
[1497.35s -> 1500.71s]  means afford it often. Don't ever give me money if you can't afford it for any reason.
[1503.56s -> 1507.96s]  Like, if you give this channel money, make sure you can afford it 100 times
[1508.52s -> 1514.04s]  before you even think to do it once. But very important. That's very important. But this is
[1514.04s -> 1517.32s]  my absolute favorite game of recent years, and I'm so excited and happy that my favorite internet
[1517.32s -> 1521.48s]  man has given it a chance. Hope you and Chad enjoy this masterpiece. Heard it's very good.
[1522.12s -> 1530.65s]  I've heard it's very, very good. Read that stuff. Read the... Oh, I'm not supposed to be looking
[1530.65s -> 1535.42s]  at Chad. All right. I'm not going to look at Chad. I'm not going to look at Chad. I'm not supposed
[1535.42s -> 1545.24s]  to be looking at you guys. Stars like our sun generate light and heat by fusing hydrogen into
[1545.24s -> 1551.24s]  helium. It's boring. As it grows older, the star runs out of hydrogen, starts to contract.
[1551.24s -> 1559.13s]  As the star's core contracts, it gets hotter, causing the outer layers to expand. The star has
[1559.13s -> 1563.69s]  become a red giant. When the core is hot enough, it starts to fuse the helium into carbon.
[1564.33s -> 1569.14s]  Man, I'm not going to lie, when I first passed this, I thought these were fruits. I thought it
[1569.14s -> 1574.10s]  was like apple, peach, nectarine. I didn't realize it. Like, when I walked by them and I glanced over,
[1574.10s -> 1578.62s]  I was like, oh, those are pretty good nectarines. If a star is massive enough, it will continue to
[1578.62s -> 1583.08s]  fuse carbon into even heavy elements like iron. Ultimately, the star will collapse under its own
[1583.08s -> 1587.98s]  gravity and then explode in a violent event called a supernova. Based on Chad's observations, this
[1587.98s -> 1598.18s]  will one day be the fate of our own sun. Manka. Fucking. S. Right, guys? This anglerfish specimen
[1598.18s -> 1602.50s]  was found attached to the landing gear of one of our ships that flew close to dark ramble.
[1603.22s -> 1606.42s]  It appears well suited to living in dark places with minimal atmosphere.
[1606.98s -> 1615.59s]  What's this? This crystal was taken from a Nomai ruin on Brittle Hollow. It seems to create a
[1615.59s -> 1619.51s]  local gravity distortion and was most likely used to traverse steep surfaces. Try it out.
[1619.51s -> 1626.58s]  Look. Get me out. Get me off. Get me off. Get me off. I'm gonna throw up.
[1627.14s -> 1637.18s]  If I had stood on that platform for another 10 seconds, I would have had to turn the stream off.
[1637.18s -> 1648.28s]  Well, I'm not. I'm serious. I'm dead serious. What you see here are parts of the Nomai skeleton.
[1649.00s -> 1652.68s]  We can, I'm sorry, I just bumped you in the face. We can tell from their skulls that they possess
[1652.68s -> 1657.80s]  antlers and quite usually, unusually only three eyes. The Nomai body was likely adapted for living
[1657.80s -> 1664.12s]  exclusively on land. The differences in the Nomai's anatomy, such as their shockingly fragile bones,
[1664.12s -> 1669.96s]  show us that Artheans couldn't have descended from Nomean ancestors. It's not clear where the
[1669.96s -> 1674.04s]  Nomai originated from or why they disappeared. We hope to find more clues to this puzzle
[1674.68s -> 1683.78s]  as we explore our solar system. Nice. This is a little museum. The sofa, chair or something,
[1683.78s -> 1688.98s]  or like a vase. Aside from the dwellings and structures they built, the Nomai also made art.
[1688.98s -> 1694.26s]  This decorated pottery was discovered on Brittle Hollow. Some ancient Nomai art depicts strange
[1694.26s -> 1697.94s]  animals, foreign celestial objects and other subjects that can't be found in our solar system,
[1697.94s -> 1702.34s]  which makes us wonder whether the Nomai originated elsewhere in the universe or simply had vibrant
[1702.34s -> 1708.90s]  imaginations. Were the Nomai born in our solar system or were they born among other stars and
[1708.90s -> 1717.40s]  planets? If they were, how and why did they come here? All this and more on this episode of NPR.
[1718.12s -> 1720.68s]  These are just some of the questions we hope to answer through further
[1721.48s -> 1733.46s]  Xeno-Archaeological Expeditions. Bowling balls. All right, pretty cool. I got all this info.
[1734.18s -> 1740.41s]  This is a face. This remarkably intact statue was carved by the Nomai, an ancient species who
[1740.41s -> 1745.37s]  dwelled in our solar system thousands of years ago. We keep touching on the Nomai here. The
[1745.37s -> 1749.53s]  statue provides us with our most detailed look yet at the Nomai, who appear to have been covered
[1749.53s -> 1754.57s]  with a layer of fur. Note the decorative jewelry that has been carved as part of the antlers.
[1755.29s -> 1759.85s]  Although their artifacts and structures have been found on almost every planet
[1759.85s -> 1763.85s]  in the solar system, we still have no idea where the species came from or what happened to them.
[1763.85s -> 1772.33s]  So this is kind of like Mayan history like we have now where it's like look, this is civilization and
[1773.29s -> 1776.81s]  they did all this stuff, they made all these things, but we don't know what happened to them.
[1777.61s -> 1788.07s]  Hey, it's my favorite streamer! Launch day at last, huh buddy? It's the translator of
[1788.07s -> 1795.61s]  TOOL's inaugural flight too. I'm so excited. It's making me nauseous. Just think, you'll be
[1795.61s -> 1800.58s]  able to translate any Nomai text you want anywhere you are. The two of us put a lot of hours into
[1800.58s -> 1809.43s]  inventing that tool, so don't break it, okay? Haha, oh geez. Haha, oh god, do not break it.
[1811.69s -> 1815.61s]  Uh, ignore me, okay? I'm just nervous and I'm not even the one going into space. How are you feeling?
[1815.61s -> 1820.06s]  I'm good, I feel good. Good, you've only been waiting for this day since we were hatchlings.
[1820.06s -> 1823.82s]  I can't wait to see all your training pay off. So what's the dirt? You're here to see the new
[1823.82s -> 1830.95s]  Nomai statue? Yeah, I knew you'd want to see before you headed off. Hornfell's just finished
[1830.95s -> 1835.75s]  prepping it for display today. Amazing, isn't it? Makes me wish we could see what a real,
[1835.75s -> 1840.47s]  live Nomai looks like. But I guess this is as close as we'll ever get. Check it out,
[1840.47s -> 1845.83s]  looks like they had fur. Fur is weird. It's the first fully intact statue ever found, you know.
[1845.83s -> 1851.53s]  And for how old it is, it's in great shape. Ah geez, I got a little carried away there. Go on,
[1851.53s -> 1873.32s]  you have a ship to launch. Take care of yourself out there. Crew? So we're aliens, okay? All right.
[1873.32s -> 1879.03s]  Outer Wilds Ventures founding members. Clockwise from top left. Hornfell's,
[1879.03s -> 1891.05s]  Gawson, Slate, and Feldspar. Which one am I? Who am I? Am I my Esker? Hmm, what's that?
[1891.69s -> 1895.98s]  Outer Wilds Ventures Timber Hearth's first and only space program was founded to explore the
[1895.98s -> 1900.46s]  farthest reaches of our solar system. Feldspar was the first Arthian to be internationally,
[1901.26s -> 1906.31s]  intentionally launched into space. It completed the first orbit around Timber Hearth and later
[1906.31s -> 1918.62s]  made the first of what would be many landings on our moon, the Atoll Rock. Okay, nice. What's this?
[1918.62s -> 1921.93s]  This piece of Nomai writing was essential to deciphering their unique language.
[1922.57s -> 1926.41s]  Although this text is linear, Nomai text often branches off from a central point.
[1927.42s -> 1932.78s]  Interestingly, each branch tends to be written by a different author. Oh dude, that's fucking
[1932.78s -> 1941.77s]  pretty cool. That's actually really cool. From center out? That's pretty cool. All right,
[1941.77s -> 1948.30s]  untranslated writing. We're nearly ready. Felix and I have finished construction and
[1948.30s -> 1955.14s]  she says calibrating the device won't take long. What about that one? Oh wait, there's more.
[1956.02s -> 1961.27s]  Fortunately, the Atoll Rock's lack of atmosphere will make calibration simple. After all, this time
[1961.27s -> 1979.69s]  I'm thrilled to finally resume our search. What about that one? A Calab. All right, let's get those codes.
[1980.25s -> 1995.18s]  All right, you are here.
[1999.64s -> 2008.87s]  Giants Deep Timber Hearth Brittle Hollow. Okay, let's go. All right, give me those codes.
[2010.78s -> 2013.82s]  There you are. I just finished pre-flight observations and local conditions are good.
[2013.82s -> 2018.54s]  Time to get our newest astronaut off the ground. He'll be our first astronaut ever equipped with
[2018.54s -> 2023.82s]  a Nomai translator tool. I confess I've been giddy all day just thinking about it. We're better
[2023.82s -> 2027.90s]  equipped than ever to unravel the mysteries of the Nomai. You and Hal should be very proud of your
[2027.90s -> 2036.73s]  work. Tell me, what's your plan once you're in space? Uh, I think I'm gonna start with something
[2036.73s -> 2042.28s]  small. That's a sensible plan. More sensible than most of our astronauts tend to be and that's a
[2042.28s -> 2046.76s]  fact. You think you'll go to the Atoll Rock then? Our moon would be a safe place to travel and to
[2046.76s -> 2053.03s]  get your bearings in space and I'm sure Esker would appreciate the visit. Plus, we don't know
[2053.03s -> 2057.59s]  what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are or why they were built. You could put your new translator
[2057.59s -> 2066.42s]  tool to... All right, yeah, that sounds simple. Fly, right? I want to fly into the sun. Okay,
[2067.14s -> 2073.30s]  uh, yeah, man. Um, there ain't no translating text on the sun. Uh, you die if you go near it. Uh,
[2073.30s -> 2079.24s]  but we'll make sure we start training the other hatchlings to replace you real soon. Take a few
[2079.24s -> 2084.60s]  photos. Don't worry. I plan on taking at least three photos and then opening the window and
[2084.60s -> 2090.55s]  whipping the phone out and then one day somebody will find it. It's actually pretty interesting.
[2090.55s -> 2096.28s]  I got the idea because I found a cell phone flying around in space. There was a picture
[2096.28s -> 2101.66s]  of this planet with these giant fucking tentacles coming out of it. It's the new message in a bottle,
[2101.66s -> 2117.35s]  man. Get with it. Excellent. You'll be needing the launch codes. Here they are. Okay. Launch codes.
[2118.49s -> 2131.45s]  Dash dash dash dot dot dash dot. I don't know what that says. That's amazing lore enrichment.
[2132.01s -> 2145.53s]  Wait, hold on. What is this? Magic rock. This strange rock moving around in this grotto appears
[2145.53s -> 2150.73s]  to react to conscious observation. The level headed among us realized there must be some sort
[2150.73s -> 2155.93s]  of optical illusion in play, but Gabriel claims the rock exists in all possible states until it
[2155.93s -> 2160.63s]  is observed. Whatever is actually happening. Both sides of the debate agree the effect of
[2160.63s -> 2191.93s]  extremely creepy. I get it. That's pretty weird. Okay. Low IQ astronaut. You made it out of that
[2191.93s -> 2205.78s]  rock. Okay. I want to make a game of thrones reference so bad, but I can't. Did you let him
[2205.78s -> 2222.36s]  touch you? Did he touch you? What the hell was that? It just absorbed everything I did.
[2223.00s -> 2233.43s]  Do it. No, I can't do it. All right. That was weird. Big thanks to these additional funding
[2233.43s -> 2236.95s]  members of Outer Wilds Ventures without whom we would never have gotten off the ground.
[2237.59s -> 2245.98s]  Matthew Steinhauer, Ben Etherington, Qwerty YouUpThePie, Jordan Frith, these kickstarter
[2245.98s -> 2254.30s]  people, Patreon subs, Tom Cummings, Sean Shark Templar Farrell, Steven Ursul Ryan Omrecker.
[2256.25s -> 2266.84s]  All right. Thanks guys. These are actual patrons of the kickstarter. That's pretty cool. That's a
[2266.84s -> 2276.49s]  neat little place to put it. All right. I got the codes. Hey, did you get a good look at the
[2276.49s -> 2283.21s]  Nomai statue? The statue was glowing. Why was it glowing? Whoa, whoa, whoa. The statue was doing
[2283.21s -> 2288.09s]  what? So it's eyes open and you saw images from your own memories and glowing lights flying around.
[2288.09s -> 2291.93s]  You mean like a hallucination? Listen, no offense, but are you sure you're okay to launch like
[2291.93s -> 2300.07s]  medically speaking? No, that statue is definitely weird. And if you're saying it happened, then I
[2300.07s -> 2304.55s]  guess maybe it did. But why? Wernfeld tried everything to get that statue's eyes to open
[2304.55s -> 2309.19s]  and nothing like this ever happened to them. I don't think you're going to get any answers from
[2309.19s -> 2314.23s]  the museum statue, but Gabbro said they were going back to Giants Deep. I don't know which
[2314.23s -> 2318.95s]  island they're on though. Maybe they'd be able to tell you more. On the other hand, Gabbro is,
[2318.95s -> 2323.35s]  you know, Gabbro. So maybe you'd be able to even search for info on your own. He's a
[2323.35s -> 2327.67s]  fucking, you know, he's a dick. Geez, now I'm really jealous you're going into space. Hey,
[2327.67s -> 2330.55s]  see if you can use our translator tool to find out more about the statue. Okay.
[2331.59s -> 2336.47s]  Good luck. Is that a carrot? Oh, it's a stick.
[2365.80s -> 2382.70s]  It was a lot faster getting back here, guys. Come on. What do you mean it was not? Oh,
[2382.70s -> 2396.15s]  he's got the launch codes. Okay. Yes. I'm going to refill my health. Can I just eat them?
[2396.15s -> 2412.02s]  Here we go. Enter launch codes. All right. I was going to say this is not going to like
[2412.02s -> 2437.13s]  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, right? Let's go. What do I do? View ship log. View entry,
[2437.13s -> 2446.95s]  Timber Hearth. Rumor mode? Village. View rumored entry. I hear there are Nomai ruins somewhere in
[2446.95s -> 2452.63s]  the Attlerock. Oh, okay. So you get to. Sounds like Esker's still stationed at the Attlerock.
[2452.63s -> 2457.43s]  They've been there by themselves for a while. All right. Let's go. I'm going to the moon.
[2460.65s -> 2472.46s]  Suit up. Little scout. See beyond the horizon. Illuminate dark areas. Detect hazards. Test the
[2472.46s -> 2485.08s]  environment. Health and full fuel. All right. Let's, let's go. How do I close the door? All
[2485.08s -> 2519.80s]  right. Buckle up. Lift off. Landing camera. Lift off. Am I in space? Holy shit. This is crazy.
[2520.60s -> 2524.20s]  All right. Wait, what's that? I need to find the moon. Where's the planet I just came from?
[2524.92s -> 2532.90s]  Where's the planet I just came from? Right there, right? All right. I need to go to Attlerock.
[2533.54s -> 2538.36s]  Is that Attlerock? Brittle Hollow. No, I need Attlerock. I want to go to the moon first. They
[2538.36s -> 2554.70s]  said that was the easy one. Giant Steep. No. Ember. Right there. Brittle Hollow. No. Use the map.
[2556.14s -> 2568.68s]  You are here. The interloper. What is that? All right. We need Attlerock. There it is. Okay.
[2568.68s -> 2584.41s]  Lock on. Let's go. Engage autopilot. Match velocity. How fast am I? Wait, it's right there.
[2584.41s -> 2591.96s]  It's right there. Okay. Slow down. All right. So I'm going to do autopilot. Engage autopilot.
[2591.96s -> 2612.34s]  I'm bigger than this planet is. Match velocity. All right. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Where's
[2612.34s -> 2630.42s]  my miles per hour? I got to get picked up by the gravity. How do I get in here? Landing mode. What
[2630.42s -> 2645.13s]  the fuck is happening? Is this right? This is the camera on the bottom, right? I'm not driving
[2645.13s -> 2663.59s]  straight into this, am I? No, I got it. Let's go. All right. Nice. All right. I made it. Do I have
[2663.59s -> 2672.55s]  all my tools? Hold on. Where are my tools? Equip scout launcher. Give the signal scope. No, no,
[2672.55s -> 2683.05s]  no. Put it away. All right. Unbuckle. Let's go. I have my suit on. Where's the hat? All right.
[2683.05s -> 2702.12s]  Flashlight. Holy shit. I can... All right. All right. I need to find... What am I looking for?
[2702.68s -> 2714.20s]  I'm trying to find the base of operations. This is my ship. How do I equip my trans translator?
[2714.20s -> 2759.24s]  What's going on? What's wrong with me? My god. We're turning upside down. We're going upside down.
[2759.24s -> 2767.54s]  We're upside down. I don't like this. Okay. I need to find writing and some clues. Isn't there a
[2767.54s -> 2778.89s]  base here? Oh, this is Mario Galaxy, but the whole world does it. Not just one planet. Get out of
[2778.89s -> 2793.34s]  there. Get out of there. Let me get out of here. What is that thing? What is that? Run. What do you
[2793.34s -> 2814.25s]  mean run? It's the sun. What the hell is that? Oh, no. Someone's playing a harmonica. No, no.
[2814.25s -> 2827.10s]  That's my friend. It's a friend. Where are you? Wait, what is that? That's another planet.
[2827.74s -> 2836.20s]  This people is playing musical instruments. Hide and seek? Is there nothing on this planet?
[2837.99s -> 2882.50s]  Jump to the other planet? Holy shit. I made it. Oh, we reviewed the logs.
[2883.06s -> 2888.79s]  Uh, I don't think, uh, I don't think he should have been the one on that case.
[2888.79s -> 2897.56s]  He tried to jump from a moon to a planet. Probably wasn't the smartest thing. Wait, what?
[2907.40s -> 2911.48s]  Atmospheric. Wait, am I? Hey, you ready to get this thing off the ground? Ship's all
[2911.48s -> 2919.08s]  fueled and ready to go. Did I just die? Oh, bad dream or something. You still look half asleep,
[2919.08s -> 2924.01s]  but that's a negative on being deceased. I know it's tradition to sleep out under the stars at
[2924.01s -> 2937.98s]  night before I launched. But if you ask me, it makes you a little jumpy. Did I not like that?
[2938.54s -> 2952.87s]  Okay. Uh, I have the codes. I do? Oh, I do. Oh, hold up. You're going to want to get the launch
[2952.87s -> 2961.66s]  codes from the observatory. I already got them. Must be inhaling more fumes than I realized. That
[2961.66s -> 2965.74s]  stuff is potent. Oh, if you get the codes, I'm not going to stop you. Good luck and take care
[2965.74s -> 2992.52s]  of that ship. Uh, you're huffing paint. This is the ship. Okay. All right. I'm go back to the moon.
[2992.52s -> 2999.94s]  I'm not jumping from planet to planet this time. Suit up. Okay. I got full fuel. Well, let's go.
[3000.98s -> 3020.60s]  Lift off camera. Okay. Now I get that LB hold to roll. You can actually do a full roll.
[3021.32s -> 3027.43s]  All right. Don't do that anymore. That's going to actually make me sick. All right. Let's go back
[3027.51s -> 3038.01s]  there. What the hell? I don't even understand what I did. Let's lock on. Oh my God. Pull up,
[3038.01s -> 3049.69s]  pull up, pull up. That was almost a disaster. Okay. Let's go. Same deal, except I just like
[3049.69s -> 3060.52s]  shit on here. I have to do. What was the, what was the thing? I got to look at my log and slow down,
[3060.52s -> 3066.98s]  slow down, slow down, slow down. How fast am I going? I can't tell. I'm going kind of fast.
[3067.62s -> 3096.98s]  Yep. Right there. Let's see. There is something on here. I knew it. Landing mode. Jesus. We good.
[3098.79s -> 3112.55s]  Am I landed? We're good, right? All right. Let's go. All right. Let me see. What does this say?
[3113.19s -> 3123.96s]  Here we go. Room with entry. Hey, there are no, my ruins on the adult rock. Okay. I saw them. Let's
[3123.96s -> 3149.05s]  go. We're here. Don't go so fast. Jesus. I'm going to get killed. It's up here. You have plenty of
[3149.05s -> 3162.90s]  fuel, right? So let's land here. Right here. All right. Found them. These are the ruins, right?
[3164.49s -> 3181.29s]  Yeah. These look like ruins to me. Hold down A. All right. Come on. Pull this away. What the
[3181.29s -> 3186.39s]  fuck is going on? What the hell's going on? What's going on? This is going to, I'm going to get
[3186.39s -> 3202.76s]  hit by this. What is this doing? Uh, I go in. I'm going in. I broke it. How did I break it? Wait,
[3202.76s -> 3212.02s]  there's, there's writing. Too close. All right. Untranslated. Holy. I was upstairs testing the
[3212.02s -> 3217.14s]  eye signal locator and it can hear and follow the signals from the sun. Giants deep and brittle
[3217.14s -> 3252.90s]  hollow. Hold on. Let me go get Otto. I don't want to come in the room. Perfect. I can hear him
[3252.90s -> 3267.19s]  yelling at me. It's like, Hey, open this door right now. Yeah. I just really happened. No,
[3267.19s -> 3274.04s]  no. He just wanted to come in the room. He gets really annoyed if you, if he's not hanging out
[3274.04s -> 3279.70s]  in the room with you. If he's not in the room with me, he'll just be like, um, excuse me.
[3280.50s -> 3284.02s]  What the fuck am I not doing in there? And I'm like, yeah, you're right. Get in here.
[3284.82s -> 3292.74s]  My special boy. All right. What does it say? I was upstairs testing the eye signal locator
[3292.74s -> 3300.42s]  and it can, and it can hear and follow the signals from the sun. What else you got?
[3300.42s -> 3305.13s]  Oh, for something strange is happening. When I asked the eye signal locator to follow the
[3305.13s -> 3311.29s]  eye signal, the devices indicator rotates wildly and never points to just one direction.
[3311.29s -> 3321.10s]  This is a curious result. It's possible the eye has stopped calling out its signal.
[3322.87s -> 3328.50s]  I see. I most likely calibrated the locator incorrectly private. My apprentice and I will
[3328.50s -> 3335.62s]  make adjustments and try again and update. Disappointingly, everything is correctly
[3335.62s -> 3345.69s]  calibrated after all. It saddens me to post it. This post this my friends, but I believe we need
[3345.69s -> 3350.49s]  to build a more sophisticated device. If we want to find the exact location of the eye of the
[3350.49s -> 3359.11s]  universe, then we will build it. Don't lose hope. Our search for the eye is what brought our clan
[3359.11s -> 3372.04s]  to this place. We won't give up so easily. Freeze detected. Oxygen tank refill. Oh, wait.
[3372.60s -> 3381.98s]  Oh, I have oxygen, right. They're looking for the eye of the universe. What's this? Okay. Wow.
[3381.98s -> 3386.25s]  Wow. I've seen this route in other travelers pictures, but seeing it for myself,
[3386.25s -> 3389.61s]  it's really old, isn't it? But wow, this is the coolest day of my life. Okay. Um,
[3389.61s -> 3396.10s]  time for some official notes. This is some kind of, uh, know my locator and point out the different
[3396.10s -> 3401.38s]  planets, which is incredibly cool by the way. But from what little I can understand of the writing
[3401.38s -> 3405.46s]  here, I think it was built to try to find something specific. I'm not sure. I also
[3405.46s -> 3410.73s]  was able to translate something about the South pole of brittle hollow. So I'll fly there to see
[3410.73s -> 3416.23s]  if I can learn more South pole of brittle hollow. Yup. Just going to get back in the old ship and
[3416.23s -> 3428.73s]  take off. Totally safe. Mostly stay safe. Oh, stars above. Okay. What's this scroll? What does this
[3428.73s -> 3437.48s]  do? Put it in here. Where should this new, more sophisticated locator be built? It may need to
[3437.48s -> 3445.21s]  be larger than this eye signal locator. The Southern glacier on brittle hollow has some
[3445.21s -> 3452.63s]  available space. I could construct a new building to house this proposed locator. Yes. Let's build
[3452.63s -> 3457.75s]  there. I imagine our young friend Connolly would enjoy that immensely. He's always held a great
[3457.75s -> 3464.41s]  interest in the eyes, especially for a child born so long after the crash. I'll begin construction
[3464.41s -> 3476.06s]  on brittle hollow South pole immediately. And Nana and those of us originally stranded on the
[3476.14s -> 3482.18s]  ember twin built a quantum moon locator there. The heat of the sun made its construction
[3482.18s -> 3489.05s]  challenging. I wouldn't recommend building on that planet. Okay. Don't go to the ember twin.
[3489.05s -> 3499.08s]  Don't. Okay. Brittle hollow South pole. Is there any more? What's this thing? What's that? What's
[3499.08s -> 3506.70s]  this? What's this thing? What does that do? Build the oxygen. All right. You touch a tree,
[3506.70s -> 3512.07s]  you get oxygen. That makes sense. All right. Let's go to the brittle hollow. Anything else I can do
[3512.07s -> 3520.81s]  stand in the middle and scream. All right. You can't get killed by these things. That's good.
[3520.81s -> 3556.82s]  Where's my ship? Why can I hear of somebody playing a flute? That's the ruins they were
[3556.82s -> 3563.24s]  talking about. Is there anything else here? I don't jump off the edge like a idiot. Like I
[3563.24s -> 3573.86s]  did last time. Chip is down there. I want it to be sun. All right. Bring the sun up here.
[3574.58s -> 3592.58s]  Is that here? Where is that? Oh, that's on that planet. Okay. That's on this planet. There's no
[3592.58s -> 3597.94s]  noise. There's no noise or anything on this one. Hey, jump to that planet. You could make it.
[3605.80s -> 3621.78s]  Oxygen. Do I have plenty? Is there anything else to see here? I do appreciate that little mini map
[3621.78s -> 3628.58s]  over there because it shows the trail, the drunk ant trail that I've made. So at least I know where
[3628.58s -> 3638.66s]  I've been. This is the ship. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. I'm just free falling right
[3638.66s -> 3645.96s]  now. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. All right. Hold on.
[3646.68s -> 3662.33s]  I don't think these little glaciers, these look really cool. What is that? Oh, okay. Hold on.
[3662.33s -> 3675.13s]  Land on that. Oh, land on the Smash Brothers stage. Come on. I can do it. What is this?
[3675.13s -> 3686.68s]  Esker's signalscope log. Day 48. Still not picking up Rybeck's banjo from Brittle Hollow. Sure,
[3686.68s -> 3692.90s]  they're fine, but I'll feel better once I can hear their music. Day 51. Listen to Chert play for a
[3692.90s -> 3698.66s]  while. Unrelated. Someone should tell Porphy and Gosan their flirting is not suitable for an aerial
[3698.66s -> 3704.39s]  perspective. Banjo music coming in loud and clear today. Sounds like Rybeck's doing okay. That...
[3704.39s -> 3710.06s]  Oh, I was worried. A week later. Today I thought I heard something strange. I don't know. It was
[3710.06s -> 3714.89s]  probably nothing. No, it's back again today too. Something strange is coming from Timber Hearth.
[3715.45s -> 3720.07s]  Okay, I know this is crazy, but the sound from Timber Hearth sounds exactly like Feldspar's
[3720.07s -> 3726.54s]  harmonica, but Feldspar disappeared in space ages ago. It can't be them. It's still here. This is
[3726.54s -> 3754.34s]  creepy. Maybe my signalscope is broken. I better talk to Nice. There it is. Right there. What is
[3754.34s -> 3773.77s]  that? It's like an asteroid. All right, I want to go there. Anything else over here? Jesus. I'm almost
[3773.77s -> 3780.33s]  out of oxygen. I need a tree. Unidentified signal nearby. Three minutes of oxygen remaining.
[3780.97s -> 3792.95s]  I mean, unidentified signal nearby. What are these living up here? The person didn't have
[3792.95s -> 3800.25s]  a space suit on. Hey, do you have any oxygen? Don't go in the fire. How do you not have a
[3800.25s -> 3806.94s]  space suit on? You got marshmallows? Of course you do. Wait, I can't breathe. I can't breathe. What?
[3807.82s -> 3811.66s]  Why would I take off my suit? Oh, marshmallows are so important.
[3813.74s -> 3828.25s]  Wait, I can do this? What's the deal with the marshmallows? Is there something about this
[3828.25s -> 3840.33s]  that's important? Stop burning them. I like them like that. Look, I know. I know that there's,
[3840.33s -> 3864.52s]  you know, like a personality test of how you cook your marshmallows. I know. All right, let's talk.
[3864.52s -> 3869.32s]  Oh, hey, it's you. Ground Control didn't tell me you were launching. Long time no see. Actually,
[3869.32s -> 3876.18s]  I guess it's been a long time since I've seen anyone. What is it? What are you doing up here?
[3876.18s -> 3880.18s]  Haha, very funny. Oh, stars above. You're serious, aren't you? That's just depressing.
[3881.22s -> 3885.22s]  Welcome to the lunar outpost, which apparently the space program doesn't bother to teach
[3885.22s -> 3890.42s]  anyone anymore. When we first started Outer Wilds, travelers used to bring their ships here all the
[3890.42s -> 3895.54s]  time for repairs. Our space bearing technology has improved loads since then, but the older ships
[3895.54s -> 3903.77s]  tend to fall apart a lot. Like more than they do now. Using the outpost cut down on the number of
[3903.77s -> 3909.42s]  launches and landings taking place in the village and also the number of fires. Nowadays though,
[3909.42s -> 3914.06s]  it's mostly just me up here raising saplings from timber hearth and keeping an eye on things.
[3914.95s -> 3924.94s]  Don't go. I mean, anything else you want? Did anyone else come by? The lunar outpost saw
[3924.94s -> 3928.46s]  more traffic back when our ships were less sophisticated and needed more frequent repairs.
[3928.46s -> 3933.98s]  Nowadays, it's mostly used to keep a set of eyes on things. Sometimes Chert comes by to say hi,
[3933.98s -> 3938.78s]  but Gabbro is Gabbro. And you know how Ryvek feels about unnecessary spaceflight.
[3939.82s -> 3947.43s]  Is it you whistling? Probably, or actually definitely. The other travelers carry instruments
[3947.43s -> 3951.91s]  so they don't bother whistling. You can pick up their music with a signal scope, you know.
[3951.91s -> 3956.79s]  Best spot for that is the North Pole. Great reception. North Pole is marked in red on
[3956.79s -> 3960.31s]  your minimap, but the Attle Rock is a pretty small moon, really. Just go north. You can't miss it.
[3960.31s -> 3966.46s]  I already went there. All right, goodbye. What do you got? Radio? What's in your house?
[3967.34s -> 3976.57s]  What's in your house? This is where we're going to find the fucking bodies. I'm going to like
[3976.57s -> 3983.72s]  put the signal scope down here and you're going to just... I thought I... No, never mind. The sun
[3983.72s -> 3995.58s]  looks kind of red. I mean, the sun is red, isn't it? All right, let's go over here.
[3999.53s -> 4007.99s]  That's kind of Monka S, dude. I love that emote. It just can be used anywhere.
[4008.63s -> 4016.33s]  You can use Monka S in any scenario. And it's just... All right, we're already here. All right,
[4016.33s -> 4027.51s]  I'm out of here. I'm going to go to that... Don't go so fucking fast. Okay, I'm out. What is this?
[4030.57s -> 4040.46s]  Spaceship. Wait, what's in here? Can I investigate this or something? What is this?
[4041.18s -> 4063.62s]  I can't do anything with this. I don't know what that is. Let's go. I can't interact with it. Wait,
[4063.62s -> 4074.57s]  can I go in it? Is it like a hatch or something? There's a hole right there. Can I go in? All right,
[4074.57s -> 4085.96s]  let's just go back to the ship. Is this... Is what I'm doing stupid? Is what I'm doing stupid?
[4086.60s -> 4091.40s]  Oh no, no, no. Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
[4091.40s -> 4096.68s]  Oh god damn it. No, I'm out of space. I'm going to die out here. I'm going to die out here. I'm
[4096.68s -> 4108.82s]  going to die out here. Get back in the gravity. Slow down. Slow down. Stop. All right, let's get
[4108.82s -> 4123.27s]  in the ship. Refuel the jet pack and let's go to Brittle. Let's go to my log book. I see... Oh,
[4123.91s -> 4133.59s]  holy shit. Look at this. We have more quests that connect. Oh, what? Okay, hold on.
[4134.47s -> 4138.50s]  Uh-huh, this is where I started. Here we are.
[4147.22s -> 4148.02s]  We can go here.
[4160.10s -> 4175.61s]  Let's go. I just monk-a-est so hard. Are you good? All right, I gotta put that in my...
[4176.89s -> 4183.30s]  Brittle Hollow. South Pole of Brittle Hollow. What's this? What planet is this?
[4185.42s -> 4194.54s]  You are... What is this? Like, how come it's not listed? Brittle Hollow. There it is. All right,
[4194.54s -> 4211.08s]  this planet looks kind of dangerous. All right, let's go. Brittle Hollow. 19 kilometers. I
[4211.08s -> 4217.35s]  probably shouldn't fly near the sun. I'm not going to go near the sun. I'm not going to do that. That
[4217.35s -> 4232.90s]  seems like a bad idea. Brittle Hollow. Let's go. South Pole of Brittle Hollow, right? Does this ship
[4232.90s -> 4250.09s]  run out of gas? The ship doesn't run out of gas, right? All right, that's good. Am I even going
[4250.09s -> 4267.94s]  towards it? Uh, 600 miles a second. 700... Was that miles? Was it, like, milloper... millipers?
[4269.46s -> 4283.43s]  1000 millipers a second? I don't know what this is. Go up and go up. I'm going so fast.
[4287.66s -> 4299.45s]  All right, let's do that easier. That was... That was too many millipers a second. Yeah.
[4300.01s -> 4311.11s]  Okay, coming up. Here we go. Let's load this... Derma's a super brumer. This planet, it's just so
[4311.11s -> 4317.82s]  small. The sun's fucking this whole thing up. Autopilot. No, I have to be able to do it.
[4319.10s -> 4350.89s]  I'm lined up perfectly. Here we go. Load done. I'm slowing down. Dodge it! Dodge it! Dodge it!
[4360.39s -> 4364.39s]  Where is it? I have to learn how to do... Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. We're fine, we're fine.
[4365.35s -> 4391.82s]  There we go. Get that landing gear out. All right, get it... All right, we're good.
[4395.99s -> 4406.79s]  Yep. All right. Looking at the South Pole. South Pole. Looking for the... the eye. They made an eye.
[4407.43s -> 4421.38s]  What the hell was that? Did I just miss something cool? There's, like, a meteor over here.
[4435.91s -> 4460.23s]  Uh, what happened? What did I do? What did I do? Why was it just, like, an atomic bomb?
[4461.11s -> 4475.46s]  Okay. I didn't do anything. Am I not supposed to be on that planet? Did the game get angry with me
[4475.46s -> 4480.02s]  because I went on a planet that I wasn't supposed to be on? Was that, like, a gear check? Like,
[4480.02s -> 4491.21s]  wait, you're not supposed to be in this part of the story yet. Nukem! Well, all right. There's our
[4491.21s -> 4495.42s]  pilot ready to get this beauty off the ground. You know the ship is a deathtrap, right? You're
[4495.42s -> 4500.86s]  lucky I'm in a time loop, because otherwise I'd be dead. The sun is going to supernova, by the way.
[4501.42s -> 4504.94s]  What? You're lucky I'm in a time loop, because otherwise I'd be dead.
[4505.66s -> 4508.79s]  And you're lucky I don't have you grounded for medical reasons, because I have no idea what
[4508.79s -> 4527.32s]  you're talking about. Huh. All right. Can I go to that planet? Should I try something else?
[4527.88s -> 4539.53s]  I'm going back to that planet right now. Hold on. Did I get any new info? Where is this? What's this
[4539.53s -> 4544.89s]  one? Esker's signal scope log reports harmonica music coming from somewhere on Timber Hearth.
[4545.61s -> 4548.49s]  Sounds like Feldspar's harmonica, but Feldspar just... We're going...
[4549.69s -> 4563.93s]  Which one? I'm gonna try this one again. All right, let's go. What's this? Planetary chart about a
[4563.93s -> 4578.50s]  while. So, okay, that's kind of necessary. Buckle up. Our hero. Where's, like, the nuke? Okay, does it...
[4578.50s -> 4591.22s]  Is it on this map somewhere? Follows lantern. That's the thing that... That's the thing that
[4591.22s -> 4597.26s]  exploded. Remember I said, whoa, what was that? Like a meteor just landed. Is this... This thing
[4597.26s -> 4619.98s]  crashes into this planet? Let's investigate. Just autopilot. All right, I have autopilot on.
[4620.54s -> 4633.26s]  Wow, that's so much easier. Why did I not do autopilot ever? That couldn't have been more
[4633.26s -> 4639.53s]  simple. Well, I unlocked it, so it's just different. All right, what happened here?
[4641.18s -> 4644.86s]  I unlocked the planet, so I unlocked it for fast travel. That's my... That's what I'm gonna say.
[4645.58s -> 4656.74s]  Okay, let's go. South Pole, right? Let me go take a... Is this gonna happen?
[4657.70s -> 4669.10s]  They said... Okay, I told you, see? It's just... Hell's just raining down here. I'm just not
[4669.10s -> 4673.26s]  supposed to be here. This is too... I'm here too early. I'm here too early. I have to get, like,
[4673.26s -> 4682.55s]  the anti... I have to get, like, the anti-meteor shield or something. All right, South Pole.
[4683.11s -> 4702.22s]  Unidentified signal. Freeze. Wait, unidentified signal. This guy, that sounds like a blue whale.
[4706.23s -> 4712.87s]  Or a car on the highway that's going by really fast that's holding the horn down.
[4713.59s -> 4741.74s]  It's right there. What is it, though? I'm going up. Jetpack. Hold... I want to... Hold...
[4742.94s -> 4754.63s]  Hold A. Jetpack booster. Why is it doing this? Power shard. Why is it doing this?
[4758.39s -> 4764.14s]  Plume. Felix and I have determined this atypical shard of rock is the reason objects in this
[4764.14s -> 4775.27s]  grove are behaving in a quantum manner. Okay. How do you behave in a quantum manner? Of note,
[4775.27s -> 4780.47s]  a unique signal is coming from this shard. Curiously, a friend, the wandering moon,
[4780.47s -> 4801.40s]  sounds the same. I've also heard the same signal this shard produces calling out from giants deep
[4805.22s -> 4809.30s]  timber hearth and the hourglass twins. Suppose there are other shards like this.
[4810.74s -> 4819.13s]  The only other object we've observed displaying this quantum behavior is the wandering moon.
[4820.01s -> 4827.05s]  I imagine the moon's behavior in this groves are related. In her note from earlier, Felix mentions
[4827.05s -> 4831.05s]  this strange type of rock isn't found elsewhere on Brittle Hollow. What if it isn't originally
[4831.05s -> 4838.76s]  from this planet? Hypothesis. This quantum shard is from the wandering quantum moon.
[4839.32s -> 4851.75s]  Perhaps it is even a small piece of the moon itself. What is this wandering moon? All right.
[4851.75s -> 4880.25s]  Okay. So it says the South Pole. Don't hit your face. Okay. All right. South Pole.
[4881.13s -> 4894.73s]  There's some, isn't somebody supposed to be here? Watch out. Yeah, this is an observatory here. Okay.
[4894.73s -> 4911.64s]  So when somebody was be working here that I know. Oh, am I right? Okay. Ship. Oh damn. All right.
[4911.64s -> 4917.51s]  There's a way to go down here. Whose ship is this? Outer Wilds Ventures. It looks like it's working.
[4918.31s -> 4931.64s]  Somebody already in here. I'm here. I did it. I put the ship down safely. All right.
[4932.44s -> 4937.08s]  Um, and that ship, in that, in that the ship went down and I didn't sustain bodily harm.
[4937.08s -> 4946.66s]  A few minor repairs and it's like, I just, I just spilled coffee on my cup. It's good news.
[4946.66s -> 4950.34s]  The bad news is I haven't found a way inside the structure yet. The door is broken and hold on.
[4951.22s -> 4960.58s]  I like was about to take a sip. I jittered. I jittered. My hand jittered a little and it
[4960.58s -> 4965.78s]  spilled a tiny bit on my lap. Sorry. I'm not great at exploring, but I think I would have found a
[4965.78s -> 4972.82s]  different entrance by now. If there was one, probably. I can't get inside from here, but I
[4972.82s -> 4977.46s]  know there are paths below the surface. I'm going to head north to the ruins on the equator. Try to
[4977.46s -> 4994.34s]  find a way down. Let's open it. That didn't work. All right. So there's a place. There's a cave to go.
[4995.30s -> 5000.78s]  What's it? What is this? Are we on emote only mode because people are going to give spoilers?
[5000.78s -> 5009.32s]  Yeah. I don't want to be spoiled. What is up here? Can I go in there?
[5013.35s -> 5024.58s]  You have to communicate in pictures to me. What is that scope? I want to see. Zoom in. Can I get a
[5024.58s -> 5050.17s]  signal from anything? I think I have what I want. Get this away. I can't get in here anyway. What
[5050.17s -> 5056.89s]  was he talking about when he said under the equator is a place to get in. I guess I should
[5056.89s -> 5079.48s]  go over here. I got plenty of fuel, right? I'm going this way. I'm so scared to get hurt.
[5080.44s -> 5086.70s]  All right. What about like right here? Oh, oh, oh my God. Oh my God. What is this?
[5087.82s -> 5092.62s]  What is this black hole? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, fly, fly, fly, fly,
[5092.62s -> 5129.90s]  fly. Can I fly? Grab on, grab onto the edge. Come on, grab onto something. I can't grab onto this.
[5130.46s -> 5137.46s]  Three minutes of auction. Come on, grab on, get in, get inside. What is this? What the hell is that?
[5141.10s -> 5157.50s]  I just opened a fucking ancient sarcophagus. Okay. What the hell is this? It's gravity.
[5162.70s -> 5166.86s]  Welcome to the White Hole Station. You fell through the black hole by accident. Don't worry,
[5166.86s -> 5174.63s]  you aren't the first. This warp tower can return you to Brittle Hollow. Every warp tower is turned
[5174.63s -> 5181.08s]  to a specific astral body. To use the tower, stand on the warp platform on the floor and wait until
[5181.08s -> 5184.44s]  the tower aligns with its corresponding astral body, in this case, Brittle Hollow.
[5185.40s -> 5189.82s]  If you look up while the station is rotating, you can see the alignment happens when the
[5189.82s -> 5209.05s]  astral body is directly overhead. What the fuck are you talking about? Wait, this is recording.
[5209.05s -> 5230.10s]  Pick up Ember Twin Projection Stone. What? Oh, that's not... What should I do with this?
[5233.67s -> 5243.14s]  Ember Twin Projection Stone. Alright, like, Ember Twin's a planet. Okay, I'm gonna bring this with
[5243.14s -> 5249.48s]  me to Ember Twin, right? I'm gonna bring this with me to Ember Twin and I'm gonna use it there.
[5250.12s -> 5261.74s]  How do I get there? Alright, I have to wait for Brittle Hollow to come into frame? I don't
[5261.74s -> 5268.30s]  understand. Okay, look up and wait for... Wait, oh, wait, wait. Is it when it gets to there, right?
[5269.02s -> 5288.02s]  I just have to wait till it gets to be 12 o'clock and then I do it. Look up. This thing doesn't move.
[5288.02s -> 5319.08s]  Alright, I'm going for it. Wait, I can't see. I'm going in. This is just space again. What is
[5319.08s -> 5326.02s]  going on? What am I... What's this doing? What should I do with this? I just have this ping-pong
[5326.02s -> 5351.34s]  ball. What do I do? Do I go in here? I'm stuck in this thing. I don't know what to do. I really
[5351.34s -> 5358.42s]  don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I'm confused. Alright, it said look up and then go
[5358.42s -> 5422.26s]  into the... Step into the thing? I'm confused. This did move. This is glass. Okay, this way...
[5422.26s -> 5426.76s]  I thought that... This is made out of glass. Alright, alright, alright. It's safe down here.
[5426.76s -> 5431.75s]  Okay, alright, alright, alright. It's safe down here. It's made out of glass. I didn't know it was
[5431.75s -> 5450.39s]  made out of glass. Okay, wait. It's following me around. I did it. What do I do? What's it doing?
[5450.39s -> 5463.85s]  Where am I going? Uh, where am I going? Is this a monorail? Do I just stay on this?
[5463.85s -> 5473.27s]  There's my ship. There's my ship. Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. That's my ship.
[5473.27s -> 5480.81s]  I need to get up there now. Alright, let's go. Oh, we're spinning. Okay, look up and then when
[5480.81s -> 5501.34s]  I'm ready, I say stop. I... Alright, now? Go? Alright, where the... I don't know where I am.
[5501.34s -> 5511.69s]  Where am I? Quick translator? Return warp status charge. Step onto the warp platform when ready.
[5511.69s -> 5519.80s]  Okay, that's a... So, this is a warp platform. What do I do with this thing?
[5522.14s -> 5525.58s]  Shit! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Back, back, back, back, back, back. Go back, back, back, back,
[5525.58s -> 5529.67s]  back, back, back. But back, back, back, back. Go back in there. Go back in there. Oh, God.
[5530.55s -> 5539.29s]  Go back in there. Ready? One, two, three. Okay, don't do that again.
[5539.29s -> 5544.87s]  What do I do with this projecting thing? Alright, what's down there?
[5544.87s -> 5552.91s]  here? Oxygen? Re-fuel jetpack. I don't mind if I do. What is this? Elspar spare jetpack
[5552.91s -> 5557.75s]  fuel. It's annoying to schlep across the planet for the ship if I can't use my jetpack so
[5557.75s -> 5564.15s]  I'm leaving this here. I check with my little scout. I do too use it. Corn fells. You burnt
[5564.15s -> 5570.20s]  marshmallow. And the scout's integrity reading said this piece of brittle hollow is as stable
[5570.20s -> 5573.00s]  as any. I just, I don't know why I read that. I read that like almost like I was reading
[5573.00s -> 5577.64s]  words out of place. But who knows? If fuel's still around, fit for it to use it, I'm not
[5577.64s -> 5585.92s]  well, wherever you're reading this, I'm sure you, whatever. Language. Languages. Langu-
[5585.92s -> 5592.78s]  wait, drop. What should I do with this? There's a language here. Hold on. The hanging city
[5592.78s -> 5603.03s]  below 50 meters. Hanging city? Hanging city. What is this? What planet am I on? I'm on-
[5603.03s -> 5609.74s]  alright, alright, alright, alright, let's go. I thought this was supposed to be Hanging
[5609.74s -> 5619.75s]  City. Below 50 meters. Well, why did you say that? There's nothing here. Um, there's bones
[5619.75s -> 5637.99s]  here. Alright, there's more things to read. What is this? To our friends on Brittle Hollow,
[5637.99s -> 5643.88s]  I just warped here from the white hole station. Our design worked. We've successfully recreated
[5643.88s -> 5649.40s]  warp travel. This is wonderful news. I can't wait to see the warp tower. It's been a long time since
[5649.40s -> 5655.21s]  I've jumped through a black hole. I don't know how close it is to the known as original design,
[5655.21s -> 5658.97s]  but as long as what we build works, then I'm delighted. I knew we could do it. If you're
[5658.97s -> 5664.81s]  reading this. Wait, this can't be correct. Clarie, have you seen these readings? If they were
[5664.81s -> 5671.48s]  accurate, they would violate causality. There must be an equipment error somewhere. I'm returning to
[5671.48s -> 5676.12s]  the white hole station. If you and Root meet me there, we can run a full diagnostic and hopefully
[5676.12s -> 5687.93s]  locate the problem. Don't tell Casaba. What the fuck do I do with this thing? There's a gap here
[5688.01s -> 5694.26s]  slotting. Put this in right here. All right. Put it in. I got it. All right. Did it. All right.
[5694.26s -> 5701.08s]  Read. What does it read? What does it say? Rami and I reviewed the records you sent, Pokey,
[5701.72s -> 5706.36s]  and they appear to show Nomai are arriving at the warp receiver on Brittle Hollow slightly before
[5706.36s -> 5715.22s]  departing from the white hole station. As I've already told Rami, these measurements can't be
[5715.22s -> 5721.22s]  accurate. How can Nomai arrive on Brittle Hollow before he or she ever stepped into the teleporter?
[5721.22s -> 5727.32s]  The implications are absurd. I don't disagree. It would mean I've inadvertently broken several
[5727.32s -> 5732.12s]  fundamental theories regarding this universe. We would have to reconsider all of our beliefs
[5732.12s -> 5741.19s]  about the nature of time. Yes, I hope so too. Pokey, as Pie is confident the reading is inaccurate,
[5741.19s -> 5744.87s]  she's kindly helping me attempt to recreate this phenomenon at the High Energy Lab.
[5745.67s -> 5751.16s]  We're designing an experiment to take more data. An update, Pokey. The High Energy Lab is in the
[5751.24s -> 5755.24s]  canyon on Ember Twin's equator. Come here at once. You need to see this.
[5756.52s -> 5760.89s]  I understand it's exceedingly odd, but Larry and I have tested and retested the equipment.
[5760.89s -> 5766.10s]  The result is the same every time someone warps. The interval is incredibly miniscule, roughly
[5766.10s -> 5770.74s]  one hundred thousandth of a second. Do you suppose our instruments can't accurately measure time to
[5770.74s -> 5779.99s]  such a small degree? We got it. High Energy Lab on Ember Twin's equator. Should I take this out?
[5780.79s -> 5802.78s]  It is. The hell just happened? What's going on? What's just like magic quicksand? I'm going back.
[5802.78s -> 5824.26s]  I'm. What the hell is going on? Oh, wait. Was I looking into the future or the past or something?
[5824.26s -> 5840.94s]  What was I just looking at? I'm going to leave that here. I want to see it again. If I stay in
[5840.94s -> 5844.46s]  here for too long, am I going to like rot my brain or something? All right. That's where I am.
[5845.26s -> 5853.38s]  This is it. This must be the other planet. Sick. OK. All right. All right. I'm going to leave that
[5853.38s -> 5864.49s]  there. Is there another place to put it? I don't think there's another place to put it. OK,
[5864.49s -> 5874.71s]  cool. Let's get some oxygen. How do I not have oxygen? I read that. What's this? What about
[5874.71s -> 5881.08s]  noises? Great sounds. Hide and seek. Outer wilds. Ventures. Quantum fluctuations. Outer wild
[5881.08s -> 5902.57s]  ventures. Let's see. How's my ship over there? What the hell happened to the ship? Why is it
[5902.57s -> 5914.81s]  over there? Can I not get off this planet ever? How am I going to get in? How am I going to get
[5914.81s -> 5930.86s]  over there? What is it doing over there? I have three minutes of oxygen. What happened? OK.
[5932.06s -> 5943.50s]  Oh, my. Wait. Unknown. This is sound over here. Pull it back. Vitals critical. It's OK.
[5945.08s -> 5957.21s]  Why is my ship all the way out here? What's something here? 66 meters down. What? Where is
[5957.21s -> 5972.81s]  it? This planet's crazy. Look at this shit. This is crazy. Wait. All right. This stuff
[5972.81s -> 5979.61s]  is explosions and shit happening. I'm going over here. Unidentified signal nearby. Where?
[5983.72s -> 5997.40s]  Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Down there. It's a guitar. What is it? OK. Where are you?
[6004.26s -> 6009.05s]  Wait. No, no, no. Not in there. Where are you? Where the fuck is this person? What is that?
[6010.41s -> 6032.90s]  I got nuked again. All right. That's the second time that's happened.
[6034.10s -> 6045.21s]  It's replaying everything I've looked at. OK. That's a that's like a time travel thing.
[6046.71s -> 6051.83s]  I get it. So I'm that we get to see everything I did. But the nuke is like a time explosion.
[6051.83s -> 6059.19s]  Yeah, that's has to be what's going on. Like, why would it show me literally everything I just did?
[6059.19s -> 6065.19s]  All right. Well, why is that happening, though? Ready to get off this ground. Hey,
[6065.19s -> 6073.05s]  what can I do for you? I'm going to time loop. All right. Yeah. All right. How am I triggering
[6073.05s -> 6093.30s]  that to happen, though? Is it just like scripted? OK. Let's go back. I got a bunch of new info,
[6093.30s -> 6101.02s]  though. I got a ton of new info. Quantum shard. This one's like a legendary quest.
[6105.45s -> 6113.80s]  Oh, that's a legendary quest. That's just a normal one. This is just like a green. This is
[6113.80s -> 6119.08s]  like legendary. And this is like epic or something. I don't know. Quantum shards.
[6119.72s -> 6122.20s]  I have rumors about them, but this one's curious to me.
[6123.64s -> 6129.06s]  The North Pole of Brittle Hollow is covered in snow and ice. There's a uniquely shaped
[6129.06s -> 6133.22s]  Nomai ruin on the surface. Nomai were able to warp here from the White Hole Station. This is
[6133.22s -> 6138.34s]  where they first recreated warp technology. There's more to explore here. I was about to do it.
[6139.86s -> 6146.66s]  OK. Every there's a lot of info. Every Nomai warp tower is tuned to a specific astral body.
[6146.66s -> 6150.02s]  To use the tower, stand at the warp platform and wait until the tower aligns with its corresponding
[6150.02s -> 6157.10s]  astral body. Nomai noticed something strange. Warped objects appeared to arrive at the receiver
[6157.10s -> 6163.14s]  on Brittle Hollow slightly before they departed. This negative time interval between an object
[6163.14s -> 6167.61s]  arriving and departing was incredibly minuscule. Nomai were skeptical if their equipment could
[6167.61s -> 6170.65s]  even measure time to such a small degree. And then over here is the energy lab.
[6172.09s -> 6177.74s]  High energy lab in the canyon at Ember Twins equator. That's where we're going.
[6181.18s -> 6191.74s]  High energy lab. Ember Twin. Let's go. I want to investigate that ship. Gear options?
[6193.26s -> 6198.62s]  Jetpack boost mode auto. Translator equip mode. Freeze time while reading.
[6201.34s -> 6214.44s]  Does that matter? Alright. I need to uh... Ember Twin, right? You are here. Where's Ember Twin?
[6215.32s -> 6235.05s]  Hourglass Twins? Ember Twin. I gotta go here. We can't lock on. OK, there we go. Hourglass Twins.
[6235.05s -> 6254.04s]  Let's go. Go to Ember Twin. This is pretty cool. This is really cool, actually. So, alright. I'm
[6254.04s -> 6257.96s]  starting to understand. So you're on this, you just have these little things, these missions you have
[6257.96s -> 6270.34s]  to do to try to unravel the mystery of the Nomai. That's pretty cool. And you go quest to quest to
[6270.66s -> 6274.74s]  quest to quest to quest to quest to quest and you trail to trail to trail to trail to trail.
[6275.38s -> 6284.70s]  That's pretty fun. Error, error. Alright. How did you... Why is that emote bigger than every other
[6284.70s -> 6298.66s]  emote? What the hell is that? That emote is three times bigger than all emotes. Alright,
[6298.66s -> 6310.34s]  we need Ember Twin. This is slowing down, right? Slow down. That's the one. Slow down. Slow down.
[6310.34s -> 6326.79s]  It's going too fast. There we go. Slow down. So in the equator of this planet, right in the middle
[6326.79s -> 6335.18s]  there's like a core in this one. Alright, go right into like into like the middle of the cookie.
[6335.74s -> 6339.05s]  Wait, no, don't. I gotta land like on this thing. This thing is spinning very fast.
[6339.69s -> 6347.82s]  How am I gonna land on this planet? It's going so fast. Jesus, how am I supposed to do this?
[6348.70s -> 6361.42s]  OK, I'm good. Unbuckle. Let's go. Alright, we're good. Flashlight on. Now it's the question of
[6361.42s -> 6371.66s]  getting into the equator and finding the high energy lab. Is this the equator? There's the
[6371.98s -> 6393.80s]  lab. The lab's like right in there. But what's this? Wait, maybe is this the lab?
[6394.90s -> 6415.93s]  This could be a lab. What the fuck is this? Uh, alright. Fire. Now. Oh shit. Alright,
[6415.93s -> 6423.35s]  there's oxygen in here? Hold Patch Suit Puncture. What do you mean Suit Puncture?
[6424.79s -> 6433.50s]  Alright, well we got something. There's a lot of shit over here. Activate the Gravity Cannon.
[6434.46s -> 6438.46s]  That is, that is a Gravity Cannon. OK. I was making a stupid joke.
[6439.26s -> 6455.05s]  Call the shuttle home. The shuttle is currently resting at the comet. The Sunless City.
[6457.48s -> 6482.39s]  How do I move this? Can I move this or something? Is it like a punch or a tool I can use? OK,
[6482.39s -> 6496.71s]  that's what that is. I can't get in there. I'm gonna go down. Walk into the spikes.
[6497.67s -> 6515.99s]  Imagine my shock when there's a hole in the suit. Anything in here? Oh, that's too far away.
[6516.71s -> 6530.15s]  Nothing else here, huh? Wait. OK. Now I think that's it. Yeah, that's it. Can I do anything
[6530.15s -> 6537.58s]  with that? Oh yeah, I can. Yep. Oh yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[6538.54s -> 6572.71s]  Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. What does it do? What does it do? What's going on?
[6572.71s -> 6587.06s]  Gravity Cannon. Gravity Cannon? I don't know what I just did. What is this one?
[6591.37s -> 6598.79s]  I think I just sucked something through. What is that? What did I just do? I just sucked something
[6598.79s -> 6618.23s]  in? All right, put this away. Wait, I can go in this. What is this? This is like somebody's ship.
[6618.23s -> 6628.47s]  This is not the ship. Can I fly it? I fear our situation may be dire.
[6654.62s -> 6657.10s]  No, they haven't contacted me since descending below the surface either.
[6657.90s -> 6662.98s]  Can I leave the shuttle to look for them? I want to follow protocol, but are they running?
[6663.78s -> 6669.61s]  I don't know what I'll do if they aren't well.
[6671.78s -> 6684.14s]  Okie pie, come back to me safely, my friends. All right, so what does this do?
[6689.06s -> 6699.21s]  How do I stop this? How do I stop this? How do I stop this? How do I stop the ride? How do I stop
[6699.21s -> 6706.73s]  the ride? How do I stop the ride? No, no, no, no. Go over here. Go in the middle. What? Hi.
[6707.69s -> 6728.46s]  Where the fuck am I? What does this one do? This is the same place that brings me back to the...
[6728.46s -> 6742.57s]  Hold on. This doesn't do anything. What about middle again? What does this do? Go out and then
[6742.57s -> 6765.90s]  What is this taking me? That's just launch, but then I just float around.
[6767.50s -> 6772.30s]  What about if I do that one? Ok, so what if I hit the right one? Where we go now?
[6773.26s -> 6784.44s]  I don't think I'm... I don't know. I don't know.
[6786.84s -> 6801.18s]  Ok, I'm gonna go back. Is there more readings? All right, got some info though. All right.
[6811.40s -> 6817.88s]  Quick while the streamer isn't looking, put knives out spoilers in chat. What are you talking about?
[6818.92s -> 6828.95s]  You can't even talk. You can't even talk, man. All right, so I got some info. I'm gonna go back to my...
[6830.07s -> 6838.28s]  This is not the lab though. Quick unmod that guy. Yeah, he's a real nuisance, isn't he?
[6839.56s -> 6847.86s]  All right, I gotta get out. Don't touch those. What's the best way to get out of here?
[6855.62s -> 6865.05s]  Ok, that's not the lab though. It's like in here or something. All right, let's go in here.
[6866.01s -> 6882.07s]  Is it gonna kill me? Mods think they are funny. This is turning so fast. It's hurting my body.
[6882.95s -> 6886.09s]  All right, what about up there? It said there was a lab in the equator.
[6886.81s -> 6896.73s]  So I'm just gonna skim the equator and see if I can find it. That looks like a lab.
[6896.73s -> 6901.10s]  That looks like it could be a lab. And there's sounds coming from somewhere in here.
[6901.98s -> 6919.14s]  All right, here we go. Did I find it? There's something down here. Whoa, it's another one of
[6919.14s -> 6928.06s]  these things. It's a cave shard. Wait, where'd it go? Hey, where is it? It's gone. Oh, it's one of
[6928.06s -> 6939.50s]  those shard things. Where'd it go? You have to keep looking at it. It's like SCP. What should I do
[6939.50s -> 6946.14s]  with it? All right, I gotta read this. Friends, if you find any sign of Coleus, I implore you to
[6946.14s -> 6949.74s]  tell me he vanished without a trace during our research trip and has been missing ever since.
[6953.91s -> 6959.11s]  Mulare, some of us from the Sunless City are here to help search for Coleus. Can you tell us more
[6959.11s -> 6965.61s]  about your expedition? Get my gratitude, Burr. Coleus and I were studying the cave's geology.
[6965.61s -> 6969.77s]  We hope to learn more about a unique and wandering rock that visits several different caves in the
[6969.77s -> 6975.91s]  area. Where was young Coleus lost, please? He disappeared in the cave at the bottom of the
[6975.91s -> 6983.21s]  dry lakebed of the North Pole, and it happened in an instant without warning. I turned away from
[6983.21s -> 6986.89s]  Coleus to examine a sample. When I turned back, he simply wasn't there anymore. Well, he had one in
[6986.89s -> 6992.49s]  his pocket. He had a limited supply of air. I'm afraid for him. Yeah, he had one of those rocks
[6992.49s -> 7000.09s]  in his pocket. Hypothesis, we will learn more by examining the northern lakebed cave, but Coleus
[7000.09s -> 7011.50s]  disappeared. Search quickly, everyone. We have no time. All right, I'm out of control. What's going
[7011.50s -> 7025.53s]  on? All right, so there's a cave. I'm gonna like, I'm gonna go to, there's a lot of shithair. Okay,
[7025.53s -> 7045.99s]  let's go to, wait, what's up here? This is where I came in. I can go up. All right, I don't want
[7045.99s -> 7051.75s]  to run out of oxygen. What is up here? There was a sound in here that wasn't that, though. What was
[7051.75s -> 7065.11s]  it? No, that is the cave. Wait, another one. There's like two or three cave shards in here,
[7065.11s -> 7078.34s]  they said, right? What the fuck is that? Okay, well, we're going there. We're just gonna go
[7078.34s -> 7099.98s]  over there. All right, there's a signal. All right, somebody up here? Three detected. All right,
[7099.98s -> 7128.73s]  there is somebody here. This is a Cadbury egg. Oh, wait, let's talk. Shurt. Oh, it's you. I take it
[7128.73s -> 7133.37s]  your first launch went well then. Welcome to the Hourglass Twins. Mine the sand now. What are you
[7133.37s -> 7138.17s]  doing? Hornfell has noticed our star charts are out of date, so I came here to update them, but
[7138.17s -> 7145.93s]  something seems off. I've seen what? 10 supernova by now. 12? They're in double digits now, and
[7145.93s -> 7156.26s]  that's, you know, not normal. Not normal at all. He's seeing the supernovas. I found something.
[7156.90s -> 7160.62s]  Why are somebody's stars supernova? What are you doing out here? Where should I explore? How
[7160.62s -> 7168.09s]  dangerous is that big column of falling sand? I found something. Actually, never mind. Please do
[7168.09s -> 7172.86s]  tell. What? Nothing you'd like to discuss at the moment. That's no trouble. If you do find something
[7172.86s -> 7181.45s]  you wish to discuss, please come find me. I'll be here studying the stars for a while. Why are
[7181.45s -> 7186.52s]  so many stars going supernova? I have no idea. Massive stars go supernova when they reach the
[7186.52s -> 7190.44s]  end of their lifespan. It's probably that the stars are older than we realized, or maybe our
[7190.44s -> 7195.46s]  models are wrong and they don't live as long as we expected. Honestly, I'm not fond of either option.
[7195.46s -> 7200.90s]  If our charts are wrong, what else is wrong? And our sun. No, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. I'm
[7200.90s -> 7210.09s]  probably overlooking something. That's it. I just need to collect more data. How dangerous is that
[7210.09s -> 7214.97s]  column of falling sand? On a scale of one to dead, I'd give it a seven or an eight. Awfully pretty,
[7214.97s -> 7220.33s]  though. Right now, sand is flowing from ash twin to ember twin. But did you know the process
[7220.33s -> 7225.05s]  eventually reverses? We're not completely sure why the sand flows back and forth between the twins,
[7225.05s -> 7229.48s]  but it seems to be a natural phenomenon. Oh, if you'd like to see something interesting,
[7229.48s -> 7234.12s]  check out the other twin once a little more of its sand drains off. I promise you won't be
[7234.12s -> 7249.03s]  disappointed. Is there anything else? Where should I go? Be honest, I haven't left this lake bed. I
[7249.03s -> 7253.35s]  don't mean to brag, but I'm really quite good with the little scout. I've been taking pictures of
[7253.35s -> 7260.18s]  everything from right here in my campsite. Let us free. I want to use the German auto emote.
[7262.07s -> 7266.23s]  All right, let them free. Let them free. Let them free. Let them free. They've they've they've
[7266.23s -> 7274.38s]  behaved. Let them free. To be honest, I haven't left this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have you seen the
[7274.38s -> 7278.86s]  old shipwreck site on the ember twin's southern hemisphere? The one shooting a bright beam of
[7278.86s -> 7283.98s]  light into the sky? It's not one of our own crashes. Surprisingly enough, this is a Nomai ship.
[7285.02s -> 7291.70s]  What ship? You find ruins across the twins, but strangely not a single settlement. Believe me,
[7291.70s -> 7297.22s]  if there was one to see, I'd have it seen with my little scout. But they live not on the surface,
[7297.22s -> 7300.34s]  clearly. The ember twin is full of cave systems. Maybe the answer lies underground.
[7303.43s -> 7310.33s]  All right. What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What is that? What is
[7310.33s -> 7328.68s]  that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? It's a bunch of floating trash.
[7328.68s -> 7333.16s]  What do I do about that? All right, hold on. What's this? God damn it. What's this? What's that? What's
[7333.16s -> 7350.60s]  this? I need that stone. I need that stone thing. Can I touch this? What if I go in the middle and
[7350.60s -> 7366.95s]  like look up? Um, I don't know what that... We're getting close to the sun. That's too close. That's
[7366.95s -> 7373.34s]  way too close. Who built this? You can already touch the sun right now. How am I not dead? Look
[7373.34s -> 7383.90s]  at how close that is. That's so close. Oh my God. It's going to touch. It's going to scrape. It's
[7383.90s -> 7406.82s]  going to scrape. It's going to scrape. Wait. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't do that. Don't do that.
[7406.82s -> 7411.14s]  That's stupid. It said that when the sand's done... Look. What the fuck happened to my body? What's
[7411.14s -> 7425.05s]  going on? What? Did somebody throw something at me? Did somebody shoot me? What happened?
[7425.05s -> 7440.54s]  Well, I found the egg guy. He jumped 200 meters into the air. This is ADHD. ADHD problems for me.
[7444.78s -> 7447.90s]  I want something to look at and there's something to look at and there's something to look at at
[7447.90s -> 7457.45s]  the same time. And I'm just falling off a cliff. Okay. Um, I have new info though.
[7458.82s -> 7466.84s]  This game is nothing but things to look at. I know. That's why I'm going to have a big problem
[7466.84s -> 7474.74s]  with this game because there's too many things to look at. All right. What did I do? I got some new
[7474.74s -> 7491.34s]  info. So many info. So many info. So many new things. That's too many things. I've got,
[7491.90s -> 7497.11s]  there's too many DNA strands here. I'm going to go back to this because this is,
[7497.75s -> 7507.13s]  there's too much going on over here right now. Real Hollows South Pole. There's a door to the
[7507.13s -> 7511.21s]  observatory on the surface, but it's broken. And I can remember I could, I could get in there somehow.
[7512.17s -> 7525.32s]  I got to finish one of these. I got to complete one of these.
[7526.12s -> 7529.51s]  Harmonica music coming from somewhere on Timber Hearth. Okay, wait.
[7530.47s -> 7543.42s]  That's this planet. That's where I am right now. Right. Hold on. Who the fuck is that?
[7544.30s -> 7606.50s]  Who's doing that? Where is that? I want to get back up to my ship. Where's the, where's the,
[7607.14s -> 7612.41s]  of course it has to be all the way up there. Is there, can I fly up there with fuel or is it,
[7612.57s -> 7625.98s]  can I only do like a big jump? I don't know. I can. How do I do it? I'm holding right trigger.
[7626.94s -> 7644.55s]  How do I do that? I'll just stay on this planet and go find this harmonica.
[7647.21s -> 7672.68s]  Let's go around here. Where is this harmonica? It's going to land right there. The world is
[7672.68s -> 7692.71s]  your oyster, Jeremiah. Yeah. Let's find this harmonica. Okay. You're in here. Don't fall.
[7693.51s -> 7722.17s]  Float. Okay. What the fuck is this? Um, okay. You, do you have a harmonica?
[7727.06s -> 7737.67s]  This thing's playing the harmonica. How? Hey, Hatchling. I thought you were taking that tin
[7737.67s -> 7742.71s]  can of yours into space today. What are you still doing here? Me? I saw something crash over the
[7742.71s -> 7747.19s]  horizon and didn't like what I was seeing in the pictures of my little scout was sending back.
[7747.19s -> 7753.32s]  But I come over here myself and take a look. What is it? I don't know what it is. It looks
[7753.32s -> 7757.48s]  like some kind of plant seed, but it's not anything I've seen on timber or hearth before.
[7757.48s -> 7762.71s]  And trust me, I was quite the explorer back in the day. I think it's extraterrestrial. It kind
[7762.71s -> 7766.47s]  of looks like something that might've come off dark ramble. Whatever it is, it put down its roots in
[7766.47s -> 7772.70s]  a hurry. I don't like the look of this thing, Hatchling. And that's a fact. I think I'll set
[7772.70s -> 7777.18s]  marlin haul loose on it. Let's get rid of this mess sooner rather than later. And no one can
[7777.18s -> 7781.02s]  remove an unwanted plant faster than a treekeeper can. I'll have to get a look at what's inside the
[7781.02s -> 7785.74s]  seed first though. I don't want to set anybody up hacking a potentially dangerous plant without
[7785.74s -> 7791.99s]  a better idea of what's lurking inside of it. Huff can help me haul the old scout launcher over here.
[7792.79s -> 7797.27s]  Obviously the opening is too small for someone to fit inside. And anyway, I'm not going to
[7797.27s -> 7801.51s]  politely stick my hands in anything that looks as unpleasant as that. That's a good way to lose an
[7801.51s -> 7835.34s]  arm. I got one of those. Doing a colonoscopy. What's that? Wait, what is that? What is that?
[7835.34s -> 7862.81s]  What is that? Go find out. I can't go in there. Help. Help. Help me. No, no, no. Stop. Get off.
[7862.81s -> 7867.42s]  Get off. Get off. Get off. Stop. Stop. Stop. Okay. Am I going to die? I threw a little scout into
[7867.42s -> 7871.98s]  the seed. You did, did you? And you're telling me it's bigger on the inside than on the outside.
[7874.33s -> 7877.83s]  Could be a chore to chop up and no mistake. Can we even remove a seed that doesn't have
[7877.83s -> 7882.63s]  the decency to stay the same size? Maybe I better grab an extra ax or three.
[7883.59s -> 7890.98s]  See, he did a lot of damage when it crashed. I like this crater.
[7891.70s -> 7896.71s]  My signal scope is picking up a harmonica inside. I don't know what to tell you. The
[7896.71s -> 7901.35s]  only harmonica player I know is Feldspar and they disappeared ages ago. Listener, don't go telling
[7901.99s -> 7905.83s]  Nace about the harmonica music, okay? They'll never let me get rid of this darn seed they
[7905.83s -> 7915.30s]  suspect it has musical talent. You sure this seed isn't from Timber Hearth? Back in my younger days,
[7915.30s -> 7919.70s]  I explored everywhere there is to go on Timber Hearth and saw everything there is to see and
[7919.70s -> 7923.94s]  then some. Trust me, we don't have anything like this. I reckon this thing's from Dark Bramble.
[7925.22s -> 7951.58s]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[7953.24s -> 7965.42s]  Wait a minute. There's a fire there. There's a campfire there. Wait a minute. Wait, wait,
[7965.42s -> 7990.30s]  wait a minute. Error. Duplicate signal. All right, keep that camera on. We're going for it,
[7990.30s -> 8001.32s]  boys and girls. I could only fucking learn how to drive my body ship. I just want to see,
[8001.80s -> 8008.84s]  I just want to see. Oh shit. All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I know what that is.
[8008.84s -> 8017.69s]  I know what that is. That's where it is. Oh damn. All right, we're going to go. Okay,
[8017.69s -> 8022.41s]  we're going to find that. Keep the camera up. Keep the camera up. Don't put the camera down.
[8023.13s -> 8042.90s]  Oh, you put the camera down, you idiot. Wait, it's still on there.
[8045.27s -> 8050.55s]  Fly the fucking ship, Jeremy. Oh wait, let me just turn my head and look around while I drive.
[8051.19s -> 8066.14s]  Duplicate signal. Let's go. There it is. I'm going to find that guy. We're going to find that guy.
[8066.14s -> 8074.09s]  That guy's here. Feldspar is here. He's not lost. He's playing the harmonica in a time portal.
[8074.73s -> 8101.77s]  Duplicate signal. All right, I got to be careful. Is this on the dark bramble? I don't have,
[8101.77s -> 8109.27s]  I don't have the thing to help. It's just too fast. Am I going too fast? Too fast. Too fast.
[8109.27s -> 8127.64s]  Pull up. Too fast. Pull up. Too fast. Pull up. Too fast. Pull up. All right. I'm going to land on
[8127.64s -> 8140.46s]  this thing. Can I just fly in there? I don't think I can land on this. I can't land on this.
[8141.02s -> 8175.26s]  Once I get close enough, I'm going to stop. Shit. Okay. Okay, hold on. Here we go. I'm just going to
[8175.26s -> 8229.72s]  dump in there. Oh, oh, oh. Where the fuck am I? I'm coming. I'm coming. I'll be there in a minute.
[8229.72s -> 8245.50s]  I'm coming. I'm coming to rescue you. I'm almost out of fuel. He's in there. All right. Slow down.
[8246.06s -> 8266.66s]  Get in here. All right. What is this? Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Duplicate
[8266.66s -> 8283.24s]  signal. Error. Fuel level critical. What the hell is going on? 1.3 kilometers. 500 meters.
[8290.07s -> 8306.31s]  300. 400. Wait, there's another smaller one? Duplicate signals. Right there. All right. Land
[8306.31s -> 8315.11s]  on it. Get it. All right. What is it? Grab it. Stick a knife in it. Stick a knife in it.
[8315.11s -> 8323.45s]  Stick a knife in this thing. No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. Wait, give me my...
[8327.00s -> 8362.46s]  Shoot it. What do I do with this thing? No, stop, stop, stop. Go down, down, down. What do I do with
[8362.46s -> 8375.03s]  this? I don't know what to do with this. Shoot it in? I'm going to shoot it in. Oh, no. Wait, now
[8375.03s -> 8404.62s]  where is this going? Where is this going now? What the hell is this? What? I'm... 60 seconds
[8404.62s -> 8424.42s]  until oxygen is gone. What? But I'm not ready. I'm not done yet. I'm not ready. Am I in somebody's
[8424.42s -> 8437.35s]  brain? Is this like neurons or something? I'm dead. Could I have flown the ship in here?
[8437.35s -> 8451.80s]  I didn't know that. I don't know what to do about that. Do I have any new info?
[8465.70s -> 8474.09s]  What is that? That happens every time. What is that? What's going on over here?
[8474.89s -> 8486.84s]  This shit explodes every time I wake up. Why? What is that? I'm going back there. Wait,
[8486.84s -> 8492.70s]  I need to... I'm going back there. No, I need to shoot it in the thing. No, what do I do? I don't
[8492.70s -> 8513.72s]  know. Grab the ship. Did I get any new info? No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did I get any info?
[8515.10s -> 8522.84s]  Dead. Dark bramble seed inside the seed. When I launch my scout into the seed that crashed on
[8522.84s -> 8528.68s]  Timberheart, it ends up somewhere in dark bramble. The seed from dark bramble crashed here and has
[8528.68s -> 8540.06s]  taken root. I'm going for it. Okay, I'm going to do that again and then I'm going to take the ship
[8540.06s -> 8545.54s]  in there this time and I'm going to continue my investigation. Right? Yeah, that was good to me.
[8546.10s -> 8548.60s]  Let's go to the bramble again.
[8561.96s -> 8587.43s]  I'm rushing. I'm rushing. I'm rushing. Wait, what's this? Where's the... Where's the
[8587.91s -> 8595.78s]  thing? Wait, I'm like rushing. I'm too... I'm too overexcited. What? Wait, what the hell is it
[8595.78s -> 8601.90s]  talking about? Why is that 15 million meters away? I'm dying. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
[8602.62s -> 8628.46s]  I'm not. I'm fine. Shoot it back in here. Okay, there it goes. Wasn't there... It looks like a
[8628.46s -> 8649.24s]  campfire there though. That's what I don't understand. Right here. See? Was this a campfire?
[8649.80s -> 8669.43s]  Okay, well, I know what that is. Let's go. I'll get it. I'll figure it out.
[8672.17s -> 8681.74s]  Get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Don't worry. I'll get it eventually. Don't worry. I'll get it
[8681.74s -> 8700.41s]  eventually. I'll get it. Don't worry. I will get it eventually. Play Hulk. This game sucks.
[8704.02s -> 8711.78s]  I don't own a Hulk for the Wii. How many times do I have to say that? I don't own the Hulk.
[8712.50s -> 8768.50s]  What is this? Is that my ship? No. What's going on? It's because it was damaged. Would it explode?
[8768.50s -> 8809.06s]  So what do I do? How do I do? You have to... I'm softlocked? Oh. Fly into the sun. Well,
[8809.06s -> 8815.35s]  I guess I could. Wait. This is gonna like... Wait. What's down here? Secret! Is there a secret in
[8815.35s -> 8836.46s]  here? I'll do it again. I just was... I was too excited and I just rushed. I was so excited to
[8836.46s -> 8842.22s]  run down there and shoot my thing. Do I need to shoot that thing though? I probably do. Do I? No,
[8842.22s -> 8847.98s]  I don't. I know where it is. No, I just... I can just go there, right? Do I need to shoot it in there?
[8848.78s -> 8855.14s]  I don't think I have to do that. Maybe I do. All right. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'll shoot it in.
[8855.14s -> 8861.86s]  I'm gonna be careful. I know where it is now. Yeah, I know where it is, but I can't track down my
[8863.70s -> 8915.62s]  beam thing. Like my launcher. I'm gonna shoot it through and then try this again.
[8916.02s -> 8926.81s]  Where was that? Where was that thing? It's over here, right? There we go. Fire it. Boink. There it
[8926.81s -> 8964.82s]  goes. Get the pictures. Just so I can know what I'm looking for. There it is. There it is. Okay.
[8964.82s -> 8975.42s]  Found it. Good. Let's go. Don't retrieve the thing. Look at the signal. All right. Let's move
[8975.42s -> 8991.10s]  back over to this ship. Why is my ship over there? Wait. What happened to my ship?
[8992.06s -> 9019.14s]  Where's my ship? Oh, okay. Right, right, right. There it is. I got confused there for a second.
[9020.98s -> 9027.42s]  I forgot. Mario Galaxy mechanics. Could be underneath you, but it's not. It's above you.
[9031.85s -> 9035.53s]  All right. Now I'm ready. I'm going to go in there with the ship this time. I'm going to be very
[9035.53s -> 9045.99s]  careful. I'm going to go for it. Let's move. I'm wicked fucking excited right now. I'm going to
[9045.99s -> 9080.41s]  go fast quick. Slow down. Seven. Six. Five. Slower. Slower. Slower. Okay. We're good. Can I get in
[9080.41s -> 9086.36s]  here with this ship? It's going to be impossible. I'm not going to be able to get it in here.
[9087.08s -> 9097.43s]  How the fuck am I going to do this? Look at how small this is. This thing's going to explode.
[9097.99s -> 9166.94s]  The ship's going to explode when I do this. I lost the signal. What's the red thing? All right.
[9166.94s -> 9176.50s]  Hold on. Almost there. Do I fly in here? Can I make it in there too? I don't think I could make
[9176.50s -> 9194.76s]  it in here. Oh my God. How am I going to get in there? Slowly. What? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?
[9200.62s -> 9237.29s]  What was that? What? What is that thing? Put your left earphone in.
[9237.85s -> 9289.56s]  All right. So I got to go faster than that. You have an instafilter on. I do not have an
[9289.56s -> 9301.80s]  instafilter on. Now you're making me excited. I'm just going to land the ship in there.
[9302.36s -> 9305.72s]  Why have I not done that yet? Why have I not just landed the ship here?
[9306.36s -> 9317.93s]  Right? Like what the hell am I doing? I can't kill this guy, right?
[9318.97s -> 9355.99s]  Okay. So there's a giant enemy fish in here. I have to go quicker. I have to go through it faster.
[9357.19s -> 9365.48s]  I don't have any guns. I do not have any weapons. I don't have any guns or anything.
[9366.44s -> 9385.69s]  That's a little too fast. Way too fast. What? Excuse me. Okay. That doesn't get up. No, no,
[9385.69s -> 9391.45s]  no, no. Unbuckle. Unbuckle. Unbuckle. Unbuckle. Okay. We're good. We're fine. God damn it. Come
[9391.45s -> 9418.78s]  on. I had somebody fire like a missile at me. There was like an asteroid and it freaked me out.
[9419.34s -> 9424.97s]  Just take off your helmet. I don't think I can. That was a quick one too.
[9426.09s -> 9428.89s]  Whatever. I'm just doing this. Flying in the fucking sun. Who cares?
[9447.30s -> 9452.86s]  I was going too fast because I was too fightable and then the meteor tried to hit me and it freaked
[9452.86s -> 9466.38s]  me out and I crashed to fuck. Can I just die already? Can I please die? Why can't I just
[9466.38s -> 9508.34s]  rip my helmet off and have my head explode? Why can't I burn as much fuel as possible?
[9508.34s -> 9535.24s]  Did I have to leave the ship? The ship was spinning around and it was giving me progress.
[9536.04s -> 9546.28s]  Yeah, we are making progress. I wonder if I can float in there. Can't wait to watch the replay
[9546.28s -> 9562.60s]  of this one. It's gonna be real exciting. Three minutes until oxygen depletes. What was that?
[9563.32s -> 9569.00s]  Oh, that's where I was trying to go. 60 seconds. Five, four, three, two.
[9572.74s -> 9580.97s]  That's just the noise that I make right when I'm about to do the Bane impression into a coffee mug.
[9592.79s -> 9601.03s]  Exciting. Good run. Good. We did it. Oh, look. There he goes again.
[9603.45s -> 9610.33s]  My soul leaving my body and I don't know, whatever that is. Don't fuck it up this time.
[9610.97s -> 9675.56s]  This time I gotta get away from the giant fish. Same deal. I'm just a guy. I don't have my equipment.
[9685.03s -> 9715.72s]  Let's go. Okay. Don't fuck it up this time. Accelerating toward destination.
[9716.52s -> 9732.84s]  Autopilot's cheating. Well, Fortnite, Jimmy. Let me tell you. You have to let Luigi help you
[9732.84s -> 9744.63s]  sometimes. This will be the fourth time I've tried to come over here. Hey! It almost happened again.
[9745.99s -> 9770.07s]  God damn it. How fast do I have to do this? Do I have to go really fast to get away from the
[9771.03s -> 9782.30s]  giant fish? I'm scared. All right. Here we go. I gotta get in there quickly. Put your earbuds in.
[9782.30s -> 9821.69s]  All right. Your second earbud going in. All right. Now where? Oh, fuck. I'm fine. Where am I?
[9821.69s -> 9859.50s]  Straight ahead. I'm going down here. I made it. I'm in. I'm in. Shit's getting louder. Wait.
[9859.50s -> 9865.34s]  It's this thing's mouth. It's in this thing's actual mouth. It's inside of this thing's mouth.
[9865.98s -> 9897.32s]  Do I go in it? Do I get out? There is a fire over there. I told you there was a fire.
[9897.32s -> 9901.38s]  I told you there was a fire. I told you there was a fire. I told you.
[9903.13s -> 9909.32s]  I fucking told you there was a fire. Nobody believed me. Found you.
[9910.58s -> 9922.15s]  Elsewhere. Oh shit. There goes the ship. Can I, can I, what?
[9925.86s -> 9932.66s]  The ship. Oh my God. I want the ship to land. I need the ship to land.
[9933.30s -> 9948.06s]  Come look. All right. Help. Help. I found you. Relax. Relax. Relax. Hey. Whoa. Where'd you come
[9948.06s -> 9953.74s]  from? No one's coming here. And then. Actually, that makes you the second
[9953.74s -> 9956.62s]  Parthian to ever reach dark ramble. After me, of course. Well done.
[9958.46s -> 9962.14s]  Say it's you. They made you an astronaut and you haven't blown yourself up yet. Good for you.
[9962.14s -> 9970.33s]  You're alive. You never were the brightest hatchling, were you? Yeah, that's right. I'm
[9970.33s -> 9974.65s]  alive. Been camping out here since my ship, you know, crashed violently.
[9975.69s -> 9979.29s]  Crashed? But you're a good pilot. It's going to pass me aggressive.
[9980.17s -> 9983.77s]  I haven't lived in polite society for a while, so I'm just going to go ahead and assume that
[9983.77s -> 9990.47s]  wasn't sarcasm. My story goes like this. I just finished exploring the core of Giants Deep,
[9990.47s -> 9993.91s]  and I wanted to try my hand at dark ramble, seeing as no one had ever been here before.
[9994.87s -> 9999.67s]  Getting around a dark ramble was easy, mind you. Once you've dodged one massive interdimensional
[9999.67s -> 10008.82s]  vine bristling with thorns, you've dodged them all. But after a while, I run into this huge angler
[10008.82s -> 10014.74s]  fish. You've seen them. Big gnarly things. And this was the biggest one I've seen yet. Ever.
[10015.54s -> 10020.10s]  I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off. Nothing too fancy. I'm going full speed when the
[10020.10s -> 10026.82s]  fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and, well, like I said, I crash. Blammo. On impact, my ship
[10026.82s -> 10031.46s]  starts making noises, like it's coming apart from the inside, and I think, well, that ain't great.
[10031.46s -> 10036.26s]  Sure enough, I barely get out of there before the electrical system starts sparkling like crazy.
[10037.06s -> 10041.06s]  It's either move fast or die unpleasantly, so I had to put a little distance between me and
[10041.06s -> 10048.10s]  my poor friend ship. I camped out near where I crashed at first. I found this skeleton later.
[10048.18s -> 10052.82s]  Great find. Would have been stupid not to use it. If I moved my setup over here,
[10053.62s -> 10062.41s]  planted my emergency tree seeds, been here ever since. Wow. Yeah, pretty much. Anyway,
[10062.41s -> 10066.41s]  that's how it all went down, hatchlings. Story's over, but I feel free to stay and enjoy the fire
[10066.41s -> 10075.06s]  a while. But don't. Fire's not going anywhere. Anything else you wanted? Uh, shouldn't I tell
[10075.06s -> 10080.68s]  ground control to come get you? Well, yeah, sure, whenever you have time. Frankly, I kind of like it
[10080.68s -> 10085.32s]  out here. Quiet, peaceful. You're a little young to understand. There's a lot of pressure being the
[10085.32s -> 10096.09s]  best that ever was. It's been nice to have a break. Well, I don't think we're going to get out of
[10096.09s -> 10120.25s]  here, Feldspar. What else is in here? Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, okay. Okay, come here. Okay, I found
[10120.25s -> 10126.57s]  something. Lay it on me. I found a dark bramble seed on Timber Hearth. That's bad business,
[10126.57s -> 10131.45s]  hatchling. This turret will tell you if you sow as much glance in dark bramble's direction. There
[10131.45s -> 10138.28s]  used to be a fifth planet where the bramble is now. It was an infernal planet. The infernal plant
[10138.28s -> 10142.04s]  appeared at the center and kept growing and growing and growing until it shattered the planet and
[10142.04s -> 10148.76s]  shattered, scattered its pieces across space. If we don't get that seed you found sorted real quick,
[10149.48s -> 10154.04s]  I suspect Timber Hearth will be heading toward the same fate. And I tell you what,
[10154.04s -> 10161.08s]  we Hearthians have overcome far too much to be done in by some worthless seed. Unidentified signal
[10161.08s -> 10184.18s]  nearby. How's that unknown? I know what this is. Yeah, it's mine. Unknown. No, it's Feldspar. Yeah,
[10184.18s -> 10194.62s]  I know what that is now. What are you talking about? Okay, what else? Where should I explore
[10194.62s -> 10200.22s]  here? That spirit anywhere is good, but you should know that space is weird here intensely.
[10200.22s -> 10204.62s]  Ever tried throwing your probe into one of these weird seeds? See there with the little opening,
[10204.62s -> 10209.90s]  it's just big enough to launch one through. Probe tracker will tell you the probe is in
[10209.90s -> 10215.74s]  two places at once. But I don't think that's wrong exactly because space doesn't work right in here.
[10216.38s -> 10222.58s]  That seed looks small, see, but inside it's bigger. Much bigger. I had a lot of time to think about
[10222.58s -> 10228.90s]  this. My theory is space in Dark Bramble kind of expands as you go through each sphere. That's why
[10228.90s -> 10234.20s]  it's bigger inside those seeds. Well, that's my theory. Keep that in mind while you're exploring
[10234.20s -> 10243.26s]  Dark Bramble and maybe you won't get lost inside forever. Good luck. You've reached the core of
[10243.26s -> 10247.94s]  Giant Steve. How'd you do that? Oh, that was a wild one. Since you're asking, I got to assume
[10247.94s -> 10252.34s]  you haven't made it down to yourself yet, right? I tell you how it kind of feels like cheating.
[10254.10s -> 10259.78s]  On a completely unrelated note, that sure was a big hollow vine my ship crashed into. Yep.
[10260.98s -> 10265.22s]  If I were you, I'd go take a walk and see where it ends. You want to go
[10265.22s -> 10269.94s]  to the tail end of the angler fish skeleton here and look for flickering light in the fog.
[10270.90s -> 10284.33s]  That'll be my old ship. That starts there. Put this guy on emote only mode. What happened to the
[10284.33s -> 10290.49s]  angler fish here? Oh, the skeleton. It was like this when I got here, as near as I can tell.
[10290.49s -> 10295.13s]  This angler fish must have been chewing on the vine and eaten the seed. And then the seed grew
[10295.13s -> 10301.94s]  and grew in the poor fish's stomach until this happened. Gross. The skeleton was a good find.
[10301.94s -> 10306.42s]  The light keeps the fish away, you know. See, they're territorial. So they're mostly avoiding
[10306.50s -> 10316.25s]  each other. That's why I set up camp here. Oh, I want you to look at that. All right. Let's
[10317.29s -> 10321.13s]  go do what he wanted. We got more info. All right, let's go find it. Go to the tail end.
[10321.69s -> 10351.74s]  Wait, should I try to get the ship back? I should probably do this on the ship. The ship. Ship. Okay,
[10351.74s -> 10370.34s]  good. All right, he said go down into the tail. Where the hell is he? He's over here. Go over to
[10370.34s -> 10378.82s]  the tail. And he said it's your journey begins there. All right, give me the scalp back. I don't
[10378.82s -> 10386.98s]  need it anymore. Your journey begins here. With that flickering light? That's where your journey
[10386.98s -> 10410.36s]  begins. Should I do anything? What about his ship? Did I do anything about his ship? All right,
[10410.36s -> 10437.64s]  I did it. Come in. Easy. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy. Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot.
[10438.60s -> 10452.34s]  Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot. What? The ship doesn't fit in there. Wait. Did I go the wrong
[10452.34s -> 10471.99s]  way? Easy. Don't break anything. No, I didn't go the wrong way. I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry that
[10471.99s -> 10484.06s]  I'm increasing. I'm increasing your puke meters by like 500% right now. Okay. All right. I'm just
[10484.06s -> 10516.66s]  gonna get out. Oh, man. We're going down the drain. Gravity? Duplicate signal. Another one?
[10516.66s -> 10548.63s]  What the hell am I? Launching fluctuation. All right. Where am I? Where am I? What is that?
[10549.35s -> 10557.75s]  Oh, we've got some info. Hold on. Trip four entry. I'm gonna say not one. Crash is three. Boring
[10557.75s -> 10563.35s]  crash is zero. Whoa. Never thought I'd see one of these beasties outside of the giant's deep. They
[10563.35s -> 10569.27s]  were awfully useful back there. Maybe a jellyfish could be useful here too. Blur. This thing tastes
[10569.27s -> 10573.75s]  terrible. The outside's all rubbery and tough. Maybe that's because it insulates the jellyfish's
[10573.75s -> 10580.04s]  insides from getting zapped by electricity. Right. I'm going inside of this jellyfish's
[10580.04s -> 10613.30s]  interior cavity. See if what's in there tastes any better. To do that. To feldspar. Do not eat
[10613.30s -> 10618.34s]  this even if you are dying. It would be too sad if this is the last thing you ever ate in this life.
[10619.54s -> 10623.62s]  I guess these jellyfish are only useful for insulation from electricity. Again, do not eat.
[10624.34s -> 10639.99s]  All right. Watch the fuel. My O2 is going down too. All right. Let's keep going around here.
[10640.95s -> 10650.06s]  What else is here? I'm not gonna eat it. He specifically said he specifically made a journal
[10650.06s -> 10667.72s]  to say don't eat this. Is that the only thing that's down here? Is that it? That's way too far away.
[10667.72s -> 10693.16s]  Any signals? I thought I was over here. There's too many musical instruments being played.
[10694.12s -> 10698.42s]  This way? Where can I go? Up? Should I go up and out or in or around or I don't know?
[10699.22s -> 10716.30s]  What's up here? Is this where I came from? Is there any other way to go?
[10717.10s -> 10723.50s]  Doesn't look like it. I don't think there's anywhere else for me to go here.
[10724.14s -> 10738.41s]  We just got to see the jellyfish. What about this way? Behind the jellyfish.
[10739.05s -> 10770.86s]  Nothing. We'll go back here. All the way to the end. Down here. Kind of. What's down here?
[10770.86s -> 10783.91s]  Well, this is beautiful. What's that? I'm all right. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.
[10784.87s -> 10797.82s]  I just am a little disoriented. What's in here? I'm gonna go this way. Out there. That's what I want.
[10803.99s -> 10808.23s]  Go on one of the ends. Right up here. This is what I want.
[10809.11s -> 10820.58s]  Got to be something on here, right? Like on one of the ends. Come on. Nothing? No way. There's
[10820.58s -> 10848.02s]  got to be like a note up here. Look. This is like these flat surfaces. How do I go down? How do I
[10848.02s -> 10866.17s]  go down? What is this? It's trash? What is this? What the hell is this? It's like an eclipse. What
[10866.17s -> 10885.51s]  is this place? Is there oxygen on this? Holy shit. Oh my god. Oh. Oh. Okay. Um. There's no oxygen on
[10885.51s -> 10900.15s]  this planet? Turn. Turn. Turn. Turn. Turn. Where's the oxygen? No. No. There's a tree right there. I
[10900.15s -> 10918.97s]  can see the tree. What? That's like seriously. I can't. Tree? Right? No. There's a tree right here.
[10921.34s -> 10949.22s]  Tree. I got a stone. Is there oxygen? No. No. No. I thought there was gonna be one over here
[10949.22s -> 10968.66s]  in the corner. Well, I made a lot of progress there. Let's go take a look at the Quest Trapper.
[10982.87s -> 11007.58s]  There it is again. Quest. Quest. Quest. Quest. Quest accepted. Quest accepted. Got it. Now.
[11008.60s -> 11011.40s]  Frozen jellyfish. Uh oh. We've reached the dead end.
[11038.14s -> 11061.78s]  Hold on to me. Hey. I hear you're leaving to see adventure. Um. How do I? Didn't, didn't he say tell
[11061.78s -> 11071.48s]  everybody? Who do I talk to? The guy in the observatory? And that thing, that thing's
[11071.48s -> 11085.86s]  gonna consume the planet. I need to tell people about it? You. I got some news. Um. Not you
[11085.86s -> 11094.47s]  apparently. Who do I tell this to? Gotta be the guy that help, Helford or something. Whatever his
[11094.71s -> 11117.67s]  names, right? All right. I'm going up. Gonna go there from here. I was holding A. Whatever.
[11119.16s -> 11130.95s]  Good run. Okay. I'm actually surprised you can die by that. Imagine seeing that. That guy must
[11130.95s -> 11137.93s]  have just watched the most heinous, awful, just person being crushed, squished right next to him.
[11137.93s -> 11147.10s]  That person. Let's go to the observatory. Right over here. I gotta make this jump or I'm gonna be
[11147.10s -> 11163.42s]  really upset. Okay. Unidentified signal. Okay. We gotta talk to um. Somebody in here, right?
[11163.42s -> 11183.90s]  Where is he? Not even here anymore. Where is this guy? Well, there's nobody. I can't. I need to
[11183.90s -> 11188.60s]  tell somebody about the. Maybe I should tell the guy down there? All right. I'm gonna tell the guy
[11188.60s -> 11201.13s]  that has the mining axe. All right. Get me the hell out of here. Wait. Hey. That you opened its
[11201.13s -> 11205.78s]  eyes but you wish you'd seen that happen, huh? Sign me too. Not even a little closer to understanding
[11205.78s -> 11211.78s]  what's going on with the statue. Was there something that you needed? Yes. I found Feldspar
[11211.78s -> 11214.82s]  and they're in dark bramble stars above. This is wonderful news. Thank you. Thank you for finding
[11214.82s -> 11219.14s]  them. That Feldspar didn't immediately join you on your ship and return here is incredibly Feldspar
[11219.14s -> 11225.34s]  of them. Never entirely sure what Feldspar was thinking back then either. So we gotta fish them
[11225.34s -> 11229.34s]  out of that dreadful place with all haste. I'll radio Gosson and have them prepare a ship. It
[11229.34s -> 11235.21s]  really should be Gosson who brings Feldspar home. Thank you. You can hardly imagine how profoundly
[11235.21s -> 11244.33s]  happy I am to hear that they're alive and unharmed. Appearance on hourglass twins.
[11244.33s -> 11251.08s]  Ryback is on brittle hollow and Gabbo is on giant steve. All right. Yeah. But what about the
[11251.08s -> 11262.60s]  thing that's taken over the world? All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited. Does nobody care
[11262.60s -> 11299.32s]  about this? All right. I gotta get back. I'm gonna talk to the guy that's looking at me.
[11300.12s -> 11307.67s]  Let me get in there. Eyes itching like crazy right now. I hope I don't die.
[11308.39s -> 11321.26s]  Okay. We're good. I really need to go to the bathroom, but I don't want to stop watching.
[11326.44s -> 11350.54s]  You go to twitch.tv slash germa985 on your phone. What a sellout. Selling up my own stream.
[11351.74s -> 11356.95s]  All right. I gotta go talk to this guy. This is not even. Hold on. What the hell is this?
[11357.75s -> 11371.26s]  That looks cool. All right. Where's the, uh, I gotta go in here. Is this, this is not even right.
[11371.26s -> 11390.18s]  Where's the, oh, okay. Where's the guy? Where's the dude doing the, where is he?
[11391.14s -> 11418.57s]  Okay. There it is. Jesus. Oh, inside my ears are itching. Ow. All right. You can't, you can't,
[11418.57s -> 11432.95s]  I need somebody like a designated face scratcher to play this game. Hey, listen to me. Is that a
[11432.95s -> 11442.36s]  dark bramble seed? It is. Yes. Don't I have info? Well, fuck this place then. Nobody cares.
[11447.98s -> 11453.16s]  All right. What we got? We have some loose ends. What's, what is this?
[11455.13s -> 11460.17s]  Giants deep. All right. We're going to go to giants deep. I've never been there.
[11460.73s -> 11488.81s]  Giants deep. Oh, there, there's our Vroomie autopilot is freaking out right now. I'm
[11488.81s -> 11513.26s]  not entirely sure why. Okay. We're good. Wait, I have been here. Wasn't this the, this is where
[11513.26s -> 11533.45s]  it just was? It is. Okay. Is there a good place to land this? A little landing pad right here.
[11534.89s -> 11560.20s]  It's convenient. Oh, nice. Oh, get off. All right. The clue was he was here somewhere.
[11567.08s -> 11595.34s]  All right. This place is like super gravity. I'm going to sneeze. Oh, I'm one to, is that a
[11595.34s -> 11609.96s]  jellyfish? Oh, wait, something over here. Oh, it's one of those things. All right. Cool. Let's go.
[11609.96s -> 11629.40s]  How do I swim down? Get out of the water. This is my greatest fear. Can I go in this? What happens
[11629.40s -> 11653.91s]  if I go in here? I'm going to go in, I'm going to go in the tornado. Let's see what happens.
[11663.46s -> 11669.35s]  Why can't I swim down? I just keep bobbing out of the water. I can't swim down.
[11670.39s -> 11687.61s]  Okay. Well, this is getting me nowhere. I can barely move in this water.
[11689.29s -> 11704.71s]  I'm just dolphin-ing out of the water. I, I, why?
[11711.26s -> 11717.99s]  This shit just got absolutely thrown into the atmosphere. All right. Well, do it to me too.
[11718.63s -> 11734.52s]  Do it to me. Do it to me. Do it to me. Wait, falling? What? You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[11738.81s -> 11752.60s]  Fuck you game. I did, the gravity was that strong? Okay. Ah, I didn't even,
[11752.60s -> 11769.21s]  could even hit me. That didn't look like it hit me. I'm not getting out of the ship ever again.
[11769.21s -> 11776.81s]  I'm only going to get out of the ship if it's absolutely necessary. Let's go water planet.
[11776.81s -> 11821.72s]  Come on. Wink. This game looks pretty neat. Left trigger goes onto water. I was holding
[11821.72s -> 11842.09s]  left trigger. All right. Here we go. I'm not getting out of the ship. What am I looking for
[11842.09s -> 11849.13s]  here? Something interesting, something weird, something cool, searching, yearning, wanting.
[11850.09s -> 11856.15s]  This looks pretty cool. Whatever it is, let's land. Oh yeah. Secret crystals. There's sacred
[11856.15s -> 11895.50s]  crystals over here. What just happened? What? Where? Um, isn't this part of the planet?
[11896.06s -> 11903.75s]  Isn't this part of the planet? All right. I'm confused. This is not part of the, this is the
[11903.75s -> 11913.45s]  planet. I, all right. I gotta get out. Look at this. Like something froze. I gotta go in there.
[11913.45s -> 11922.74s]  Can I get out of here or should I? Easy. All right. Get out, get out, get out, get out, unbuckle.
[11924.39s -> 11941.64s]  Get out. I want to see, I want to read this. It's like a, I thought that, okay. I thought this was
[11941.64s -> 11956.28s]  writing. I thought it was writing on the side. It's just sticking out. Ghost matter? What does
[11956.36s -> 11961.18s]  go? Wait, I remember that. Wait, we talked about that. Ghost matter. What's that mean?
[11972.15s -> 11990.71s]  Trees detected. How do I get up this? This water sucks. I gotta like land in it. I want to see the
[11990.71s -> 12015.16s]  ghost matter. Yep. I weigh like 6,000 pounds on this planet, apparently. Get on the surface.
[12016.04s -> 12031.88s]  Too much gravity. Okay. I can't get up there. I'm going to use my, my camera over there.
[12031.88s -> 12051.14s]  I'm going to shoot my camera over here. Oh damn. All right. I got to get over there.
[12051.14s -> 12057.03s]  I got to get over there. I got to get over there. What? Wait, wait. Hold on. What's this?
[12058.07s -> 12082.89s]  Freeze. Threat detected. What? Threat detected. What? What? Threat detected. Threat detected.
[12093.43s -> 12108.55s]  Ghost? What are you supposed to do about the ghosts? There's just ghosts in there.
[12110.09s -> 12113.53s]  Shit. I was on, I was right. I was, God, I was going down there. All right. We're going to a new
[12113.53s -> 12119.59s]  planet. I don't like that place. I have open mysteries in like three different places.
[12124.95s -> 12137.77s]  The negative time interval measured at the White Pole Station was further investigated at the high
[12137.77s -> 12149.75s]  energy lab in the canyon at Ember Twin's equator. Or, a man named Cully has mysteriously vanished
[12149.75s -> 12154.47s]  from a cave at the bottom of the dry lake that at Ember Twin's North Pole. And we're going back to
[12154.47s -> 12172.52s]  Ember Twin. There's one on this planet. Wait, there's one on this planet. Let's find it.
[12182.26s -> 12195.67s]  Looking for quantum. Quantum fluctuations. Oh, crash. Don't embarrass me. Am I stuck on a tree?
[12196.47s -> 12209.14s]  Wait, it's in the museum. Is it the one in the museum? Or is it somewhere, is it another one on
[12209.14s -> 12226.20s]  the planet? No, no, there's another one. Where is that? It's in the museum. But is it though?
[12226.92s -> 12234.14s]  It's one of the museum. Wait a minute. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold
[12234.14s -> 12245.93s]  up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. You say museum like an asshole. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I
[12245.93s -> 12257.88s]  apologize. I am from a different part of the world as you. Sorry. Excuse me. I have a slight
[12257.88s -> 12276.23s]  accent from a different part of the world. Excuse me. Museum. Museum. Museum. Museum. Car. Museum.
[12277.72s -> 12285.67s]  My room. Why do you say room? Hey, why does he say room? Is it possible that he's from a different
[12285.67s -> 12292.71s]  part of the world than me? How is this possible? It's not even, it's not even possible to be from
[12292.71s -> 12312.30s]  a different part of the world that it's not. Okay. Where am I going? He's malding about mouth noises.
[12313.02s -> 12324.12s]  I gotta go to my room. What the fuck did you say? Sorry. My room. My room. My room. My room. My room.
[12326.73s -> 12339.19s]  That's an idiot. Got it. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of
[12339.19s -> 12396.44s]  here. Get the fuck out of here. I found it. Ghost matter. Ghost. What am I supposed to do about that?
[12404.76s -> 12422.41s]  Is there more? Oh man, there's more. Wait, hold on. Photo. Well, I didn't know you could do that.
[12422.41s -> 12435.77s]  Okay, it's right over here. Can I like collect that shit or is there, can I walk around it?
[12436.41s -> 12444.47s]  Is there anything to do over there? Wait, hold on. Is there any reason to be over this way?
[12445.11s -> 12456.87s]  There's nothing over here. I gotta go find that quantum, quantum beam. It's a fun word to say.
[12457.75s -> 12466.17s]  Quantum. I want to make a username now, rather than it being like German 985,
[12466.17s -> 12470.57s]  like German. No, no, no. It would be, it'd be fucking quantum conundrum.
[12473.56s -> 12495.05s]  What? Oh, there's a way. Where is this thing? Down here. All right, let's get back in them.
[12495.05s -> 12497.61s]  I was gonna say, I know I say both every time, but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[12497.61s -> 12503.42s]  there's too much to see. I can't play this game. I can't do it. I can't do it.
[12504.06s -> 12507.58s]  Now it's too many things to look at. Let's take somebody like the things to touch and look at and
[12507.58s -> 12524.26s]  press. I can't play this game. It's down here, but I'm gonna just go this way. It's down in,
[12524.42s -> 12530.79s]  inside the earth. Let's go this way. See if I can find it. Okay. I can't play this game. I'm gonna,
[12530.79s -> 12537.96s]  I'm going home. I'm out. I'll see you guys in like a month. All right. I'm gonna have to play this
[12537.96s -> 12542.20s]  game for the next six months to find myself alone in like my room. Sorry, my room, my room,
[12542.20s -> 12565.11s]  my room, my room, my room, my room. This way. Is there a spot I can go in? See like a little
[12565.11s -> 12576.78s]  canyon. Ooh, there's a little canyon over here, guys. Okay, guys, we found a little canyon.
[12579.70s -> 12587.85s]  What's down here? Maybe. Okay, guys, we can go this way. Looks like we may have stumbled across
[12587.85s -> 12612.31s]  something here, guys. It's like it's in there somewhere. Okay, guys. All right, we did something.
[12620.10s -> 12640.95s]  Ah, how do I get in there? Down in the geyser or something? Let me just see what's up here.
[12648.04s -> 12670.17s]  Snow. All right. All right. Okay. This is icy. Oh, come on. I, I, come on. What? I was floating.
[12670.17s -> 12675.96s]  I was very trying to be very careful. Was I really going that fast? How fast was I going?
[12676.76s -> 12701.34s]  All right. I'm doing a quest, different quest, different quest. We're going to do, I don't know,
[12701.34s -> 12712.47s]  different. This game is good though. I like this game. I can see why people like this game.
[12713.03s -> 12727.02s]  It makes sense to me now. Okay. Quantum fluctuation. I'm going to go over here.
[12727.82s -> 12746.30s]  Let's check this side. All right. All right. Hold on. Unknown. Unknown. Here it is. It's in there.
[12747.18s -> 12782.18s]  All right. Everybody relax. Found it. Can I land this in here? Let's go. F.A. laugh. There it is.
[12782.18s -> 12796.92s]  Identified grove shard. All right. Now don't look at it. Okay. It changed. Where did it go?
[12798.73s -> 12827.34s]  How is it? I'll give you privacy. Now, where'd you go? Only two places? All right. Let's go update
[12827.34s -> 12838.68s]  this. It's that one. It's a strange rock shard in this grove that moves when I'm not watching it.
[12838.68s -> 12843.62s]  It's a signal on the quantum fluctuations frequency. What about here? I'm looking at
[12843.62s -> 12851.43s]  something. Giants deep. Quantum signal on Giants deep. Bottom of the dry lake bed at Ember Twin.
[12851.43s -> 12857.62s]  All right. I got to get to Giants. It's deep. Wait. What's down here?
[12859.77s -> 12864.97s]  Kurt saw a Gnomai shipwreck shooting a beam of light into the sky somewhere in Ember Twin's
[12864.97s -> 12874.01s]  southern hemisphere. All right. We got to go to the Ember Twin's thing. Let's go. So much shit there.
[12874.01s -> 12896.26s]  Ember Twins. So what are you guys doing for the Super Bowl? Super Bowl coming up.
[12898.31s -> 12915.35s]  Gonna eat some pizza. Wings. What are you guys doing? All right. Let's do it. Wait. Where you
[12915.35s -> 12925.82s]  going? Southern hemisphere. That's it right there. Where are you going? Wait. Oh, I was wrong. It's
[12925.82s -> 12941.10s]  over here. Who gives a shit? I mean, who gives a shit? Who gives a shit? I don't know. All right.
[12941.10s -> 12949.45s]  Which one should I go on? This thing is just going for me every time. What is this thing?
[12950.41s -> 12956.66s]  The interloper. What the fuck is this thing? I want to know what this is. No, I don't.
[12957.30s -> 12970.54s]  Focus. Where is the... Where do they go? The out... No. Where is it? Did they go there? All...
[12971.18s -> 12993.03s]  What? The Ember... Ember Twins. All right. Go. What just happened? Okay. We're on our way.
[12993.67s -> 13001.98s]  Wherever it is. Where is it? I don't even know if I'm up or down. I don't know if I'm up or down.
[13001.98s -> 13016.01s]  There we go. Ember Twins. Ember Twins. Ember Twins. Ember Twins. Not Ashton. Ember Twins. Ember Twins.
[13016.01s -> 13042.18s]  All right. Ember Twins. Let's land. Slow down a little. I gotta go to the southern hemisphere
[13042.18s -> 13067.16s]  here. It's really fucking fast, man. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Southern hemisphere.
[13068.42s -> 13097.34s]  Go. Get fucking hype. Let's go, guys. There? What are we looking for? Cave Shop. Cave Shop.
[13097.34s -> 13108.52s]  Okay. This is the southern hemisphere. There, somewhere. Guys, why are you not getting hype?
[13112.89s -> 13118.25s]  Fucking... I'm gonna get... I'm gonna actually get furious in a minute. I'm not seeing enough
[13118.25s -> 13123.05s]  fucking people in this chat say a ton of fucking shit. Like, what the fuck?
[13124.01s -> 13136.46s]  Okay, so here's another one. The planets are aligned. This planet sometimes, and only sometimes,
[13136.46s -> 13141.90s]  has a moon. It's also of note. It disappears if no one's watching it. Isn't that a fascinating
[13141.90s -> 13148.04s]  orbital characteristic? It's my first time encountering a natural satellite with the
[13148.04s -> 13153.26s]  ability to vanish when not being watched. Just study it. Or even better, we should travel there.
[13155.13s -> 13159.77s]  I agree. Our first step would be determining a method to track this phantom moon so we can always
[13159.77s -> 13166.97s]  know where it is. Given its reluctance to move while consciously observed, it might be a form of
[13166.97s -> 13177.64s]  macroscopic quantum mechanics. Cool. Found your note, Malore. Kindly count me among this moon's
[13177.64s -> 13184.46s]  admirers. What is happening when it disappears? Has it moved to another location? I believe so.
[13184.46s -> 13188.54s]  Not only does the moon appear around brutal hollow, I can confirm it sometimes orbits
[13188.54s -> 13202.12s]  timber hearth as well. All right, that's pretty cool, man. All right, I don't want this moon.
[13202.12s -> 13219.91s]  Freeze detected. Oh, it's a campfire. Church research note. Property of church. Clearly the
[13219.91s -> 13225.51s]  Nomai were making astronomical observations here. They chose an excellent spot. This is a big
[13225.51s -> 13232.81s]  rotating device board. What was it the Nomai were observing? I'd post it. There's something special
[13232.81s -> 13238.25s]  about the orange symbol on that device. Al and the new astronaut's translator tool would be nice
[13238.25s -> 13272.39s]  to handy have right now. It'd be cool if you had it. They didn't, never mind. I need a spot to put this
[13273.27s -> 13298.17s]  down there. Oh, there's a big beam. God damn it, Jerma. Why are you still playing this fucking game?
[13298.81s -> 13305.66s]  I thought I was gonna just, just to make you angry. I knew you were gonna be here when you came in
[13305.66s -> 13309.34s]  and I was like, hold on. Shit, we're pretty quiet. I'm gonna make this guy, I'm just,
[13309.34s -> 13329.85s]  we'll only make this guy angry. Already holding. Where's the little, what's the slot? There's usually
[13329.85s -> 13343.86s]  a slot. Did I miss it over here? There's like an empty triangle I usually can put this in.
[13344.50s -> 13357.78s]  What is going on? Am I missing something here? I don't get it. Was there a slot I could have put
[13357.78s -> 13367.80s]  this? Wait, what do you, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is, wait, I can take this out and
[13367.80s -> 13373.14s]  put this in. This is the first time I've ever done that. I didn't know you'd do that. I didn't know
[13373.14s -> 13378.81s]  this is, I had other text on it. I thought this was, I thought this was written on this wall.
[13379.69s -> 13391.05s]  I didn't know you could do that. Quantum moon locator is functioning. We have markers for each
[13391.05s -> 13401.91s]  of the places the moon goes. Observe the quantum moon in orbit around dark bramble. Okay. You've
[13401.91s -> 13408.90s]  keen eyes, my friends. This moon travels to a total of five locations. Jerma, it was cool to meet you
[13408.90s -> 13417.85s]  at McDonald's the other day. We didn't do that. Five locations, not four. Added a marker for dark
[13417.85s -> 13423.83s]  bramble. I thought the locator now accounted for all the phantom moon's locations, but sometimes
[13423.83s -> 13427.03s]  the locator can't tell where the moon is. Perhaps there's a problem with the device.
[13428.15s -> 13433.43s]  It's also possible there's a sixth place in the star system where the phantom moon travels.
[13434.23s -> 13453.51s]  I mean, it's one, two, they line up like this. So where's the one that was the last one? How many
[13453.51s -> 13465.99s]  would you have? One, two, three, four, five. You don't have this right. Okay. Hold on. These are
[13465.99s -> 13474.47s]  always there. This one's freaking out. These two are always in the case of one, two, three are
[13474.47s -> 13488.97s]  always there. This one, what's this one tracking? That's tracking dark bramble. All right. This is
[13488.97s -> 13503.35s]  the one that I have to be looking at it. There it is. Right. I gotta go there. I gotta go there.
[13503.35s -> 13535.34s]  I gotta go there. What the hell is that though? I gotta go there. Fuck. How do I wait? No, wait.
[13535.98s -> 13559.35s]  Where'd it go? No, where'd it go? I should, I should have. Right, here it goes.
[13560.07s -> 13576.06s]  Ah, there it is. Here's what I have to do. I gotta get in the ship. Let's get a wafer to orbit
[13576.06s -> 13585.59s]  somewhere and then go to where it is. It should be there for a little while. It appears when you
[13585.59s -> 13623.51s]  look at it. I had it. I had it too. I was looking at it. I had it too. It's invisible right now,
[13624.07s -> 13633.10s]  but it's right here. You won't be able to get in the ship without it moving.
[13635.66s -> 13638.94s]  I just can't look at it for a second. I have to wait till it comes behind me.
[13640.06s -> 13652.52s]  Orbiting around. Is it that? Right now it's orbiting around. Okay, here it goes.
[13653.80s -> 13662.36s]  It's changing to orbit around. Where are you going? Okay, you back on the hearth. Where?
[13662.36s -> 13677.96s]  Wrong strategy. I don't know. Right there. On it. All right, it's right there. All right, so how do
[13678.52s -> 13687.42s]  I keep looking at this so I keep staying at it? It's right there. All right, I know what I'm gonna
[13687.42s -> 13690.94s]  do. All right, here we go. I'm gonna go to this planet and I'm gonna hang out out here until it
[13690.94s -> 13697.75s]  comes over this way. All right, I'm going to whatever this... I don't know what that planet's
[13697.75s -> 13701.59s]  called. I'm going there. All right, I'm going there. I'm going there. I'm going there. That's
[13701.59s -> 13716.63s]  where I'm going. What's this place called? Brittle Hollow. I'm going to Brittle Hollow. I'm gonna go
[13716.63s -> 13727.91s]  to Brittle Hollow and I'm gonna... I don't think I can lock it in or anything. It's gone. Yeah,
[13728.39s -> 13733.90s]  it just it jumps from planet to planet. Unless there's some way I have to keep it in focus
[13733.90s -> 13755.08s]  or something. I'm gonna say that... I know what it looks like. I'm almost dead. I'm gonna die.
[13755.08s -> 13775.83s]  I'm gonna die. I need to go to my ship right now. All right, I'm gonna go to Brittle Hollow
[13775.83s -> 13782.44s]  and I'm gonna just chill. I'm gonna wait. I'm gonna wait till it orbits. I think maybe... Let's put
[13782.44s -> 13796.33s]  this data in here. A quantum moon locator. Quantum moon. Sixth location. I know my hypothesis that
[13796.33s -> 13800.49s]  the quantum moon might be a form of macroscopic quantum mechanics. Quantum moon travels to a
[13800.49s -> 13807.21s]  total of five locations. That's not true. Quantum moon sometimes disappears possibly to an unknown
[13807.21s -> 13826.26s]  sixth location. Disappear when no one was watching. I'm just gonna see if that works.
[13826.90s -> 13854.30s]  I'm just gonna see if it appears eventually. If I just chill. Am I getting too close to the sun?
[13855.02s -> 13867.43s]  Oh no. Oh no. We're good. Okay. We're good. All right. Looking for a moon now. Slow down. Going way too
[13867.43s -> 13877.00s]  fucking fast. Way too fast. All right. I need my fluctuations. I'm just gonna... There it is.
[13877.00s -> 13905.26s]  Right there. There it is. I found it. Why is it so far away? No, that's not it. That's not it. When is
[13905.26s -> 13934.07s]  it gonna orbit? Where is it? I need to be looking at it or something. Follows lantern. There it is.
[13934.87s -> 13953.99s]  No. What? That's not it. Is that it? I don't think so. Where is... What if... Okay. What if I go
[13955.69s -> 13982.84s]  and look at it? And then just in the ship look at it? And it has to travel to one of these
[13982.84s -> 14014.62s]  locations, right? It has to. It's got to appear here eventually. Where is the moon? Where is it?
[14032.71s -> 14074.62s]  Hold on. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. All right. I got an idea. I got an idea. My idea didn't work.
[14091.83s -> 14104.87s]  Wait. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Okay. Here's my idea. Go back on the planet with and go back
[14104.87s -> 14110.12s]  on the planet and listen to this shit. Back on the planet with things spinning around. You can
[14110.12s -> 14128.10s]  actually see the thing. Take a picture of it when you... What the fuck was that? Did I avoid it?
[14144.33s -> 14149.66s]  Get it in the spot that I want it and take a photo of it. Keep the photo up and then
[14149.66s -> 14154.62s]  it'll be there. It's just as long as somebody's looking at it. It's as long as there's a photo
[14154.62s -> 14170.33s]  of it or something, right? That's what I think I gotta do. The camera would technically be looking
[14170.33s -> 14191.88s]  at the moon the whole time. Technically. Let me try that. Let's go. He's reading a guide?
[14192.28s -> 14201.99s]  What? I'm not reading a guide. Why would I do that? You should fuck up though, man. You can get me
[14201.99s -> 14215.66s]  in trouble. All right. I know what to do. Let's go back to the ember place. That's definitely what
[14215.66s -> 14221.30s]  you have to do. All right. Judging by the last weird thing that I had to do. Remember when I
[14221.30s -> 14229.75s]  had to... What did I have to do that was kind of like that before? I had to do... There's something
[14229.75s -> 14241.86s]  I had to do like that before. I was eating marshmallows. No. It was different. It was
[14241.86s -> 14255.10s]  something else. Game boomers cheating streamer. All right. That's what I'm gonna do.
[14256.06s -> 14279.27s]  Give it a whirl. Is that it? Is this it? Is that it? Is this it? This is it. That's it.
[14279.83s -> 14289.72s]  This is it, right? All right. Slow down. This is it. Is this it? Ooh. This is it. All right. I'm on
[14289.72s -> 14294.52s]  the secret moon. Secret moon. I'm on secret moon. Let's go. Before it disappears. This is it, right?
[14295.90s -> 14313.02s]  Is it? Wait. Is that it? Wait. That's it. It's that one. It's that one. It's that one. It's that one.
[14313.02s -> 14317.13s]  It's that one. It's that one. No, no, no. Don't get it. Don't get it out of my sight. I have to
[14317.13s -> 14325.14s]  take a picture of it. I have to take a photo of it. Take a photo of it. Okay. Right? Did I get it?
[14325.14s -> 14344.04s]  Okay. I got a picture of it. Okay. I got a photo of it. Let's go. All right. Now, don't put the
[14344.04s -> 14369.90s]  camera down. Okay. Where is it? Is that it? All right. Does this work?
[14385.82s -> 14389.02s]  Okay. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Where is it? Is that it?
[14389.26s -> 14401.14s]  What? Where is it? I need my quantum fluctuations. Where is it? What's going on?
[14402.02s -> 14413.70s]  I don't know which direction I'm facing. Okay. There it is. No, that's not it. Where is it?
[14414.26s -> 14468.65s]  Is that it? No. Where is it? Wait. Hold on. Look at the photo. I was in a perfect spot. I was...
[14468.65s -> 14475.45s]  Okay. Let me try to redo that. I'm going to stay in the ship. I'm going to stay in the ship
[14476.09s -> 14487.90s]  because remember... What are you doing? Why is autopilot flying in the fucking sun?
[14513.22s -> 14519.98s]  Good last words. I just imagine like three or four people sitting around eating dinner
[14519.98s -> 14524.70s]  with autopilot on. That's the reason why the fucking driverless cars ain't ever going to work.
[14527.67s -> 14534.55s]  This cabbage is absolutely fantastic, dear. Thank you, honey. Yeah. But any news? Yeah. We
[14534.55s -> 14550.33s]  actually... Why is my game stuck? Oh, my daughter of mine. How's school? It's going great, dad.
[14553.48s -> 14560.07s]  What do you think about the snake, honey? It's so good, mom. You're the best.
[14560.87s -> 14568.31s]  Yeah, she sure is. What a happy fucking family we have. That's it. I'll do the dishes tonight.
[14569.11s -> 14590.07s]  Let me go over here. Honey, why is autopilot flying into the sun? Boom. God damn it. All right. Back
[14590.07s -> 14606.86s]  to where it was. It was right here, right? And then I'm going to stay in the ship. Yeah, I freaked
[14606.86s -> 14614.31s]  out. All right. I have a... I can take a picture. Wait, is it? Hold on. Hold on. Wait. I'm going to
[14614.31s -> 14622.82s]  do the exact same fucking thing I did. There's no cabbage in space. Oh, please.
[14622.82s -> 14632.33s]  Please. My apologies. All right. Don't fucking crash. Don't crash. Okay. I freaked out here
[14632.33s -> 14638.66s]  because I was like, oh, this is it. And then I saw it. Where did I see it? It was like
[14640.71s -> 14652.23s]  right here somewhere. I'll wait till I can see it. And then I'm going to look
[14655.80s -> 14673.02s]  for it. It's going to port over here eventually. Don't break. Come on. Where is it? Because I had
[14673.02s -> 14688.98s]  it too. I had it. Actually had the damn thing. It... All right. Take a picture of it. Quick.
[14689.54s -> 14692.34s]  Slow down. Slow down. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Take a picture of it. Quick.
[14693.14s -> 14719.58s]  Now what? Can I land on this or something? What am I supposed to do? I'm in. I made it.
[14726.73s -> 14744.65s]  I found the quantum moon and there's some fucked up shit going on over here. Wait, where'd it go?
[14748.22s -> 14769.93s]  What? Okay. Was I almost about to get squished in the elevator? Was I actually about to die to that?
[14769.93s -> 14775.75s]  That would have been so embarrassing. I would have ended the stream. Okay. Turn the lights on.
[14776.55s -> 14787.48s]  Okay. So we have some translation here. You have recalled the rule of quantum imaging.
[14787.48s -> 14794.42s]  Recall the rule of quantum entanglement. Recall the rule of the sixth location.
[14795.38s -> 14808.52s]  Eh. Tell me the rule of higher pay grade than me is going to have to come figure this one out.
[14809.48s -> 14816.47s]  Have to move these or something? All right. I remember seeing this image on... Okay. These
[14816.47s -> 14825.88s]  are just the planets. But this is currently set onto the twin embers, right? Ember moon,
[14825.88s -> 14834.15s]  ember planet, and ash planet. So why is that on there right now? Why is that there? These are
[14834.15s -> 14840.22s]  just the... Okay. There's like the bramble. There's whatever that is. What locations are these? Okay.
[14840.22s -> 14858.01s]  I don't know. I can't move this. What does this shit say? You recall the rule of quantum imaging.
[14858.81s -> 14868.58s]  Quantum entanglement. Sixth location. I don't know what the sixth location is.
[14869.62s -> 14895.67s]  Let me explore this place a little more. What's this? That's not mine. That's a different ship.
[14896.39s -> 14911.75s]  Whose ship is this? That's not my ship. What is this? I'm here after watching it wander the
[14911.75s -> 14919.50s]  skies for so long. I'm about to stand on the quantum moon. As expected, my shuttle has landed
[14919.50s -> 14925.32s]  at the moon's south pole. I will make the remainder of my journey on foot. If you don't know why the
[14925.32s -> 14930.52s]  quantum moon always welcomes its visitors at the south pole, just that this is true. As a child,
[14930.52s -> 14935.96s]  I considered such unknowns sinister. Now, though, I understand they bear no ill will. The universe is,
[14935.96s -> 15004.31s]  and we are. I am ready. Shit. I'm here. Where is here? This is that ship room before. I don't...
[15005.35s -> 15025.05s]  I think I might be in trouble here. Look, just jump on a cactus. Well, I got a lot of info.
[15026.92s -> 15028.20s]  All right. Can I make it? Let's try.
[15038.71s -> 15054.07s]  The ultimate fall joke. It's gonna last 10 straight minutes. Actually, I might get there.
[15054.95s -> 15068.63s]  No, I'll get there. I'm gonna get there. I'm never... Somebody said I'm never gonna beat this.
[15069.75s -> 15079.11s]  I think I've made pretty good progress so far. I found the secret moon. I found the Cadbury egg.
[15079.75s -> 15094.82s]  Where is my... What is my ship doing over here? Wait, what? Wait. Wait. Why is it floating? I
[15094.82s -> 15164.25s]  thought it was on the moon. What? See you, nerd. God damn it. Just watch the fireworks when the
[15164.25s -> 15177.66s]  universe ends. I'm gonna be pretty far away. Wait a minute. Hold on. Wait, what is that photo of?
[15178.62s -> 15194.60s]  How did it get up there? I just want to see it one more time. No, I just want to see it one more
[15194.60s -> 15222.94s]  time before I die. You're not leading it enough. That's too far away.
[15245.13s -> 15251.05s]  So what did I... That thing teleported me back to... I pressed the wrong button or something?
[15251.93s -> 15253.53s]  All right. Let me... I gotta go see.
[15255.45s -> 15292.71s]  There we go. Boom. Go. There it is. There it goes. Whatever it is. Okay. Let's go take a look at the
[15292.71s -> 15313.30s]  data. Data. What we got? You found the quantum moon. You found the quantum shrine. You found
[15313.30s -> 15324.95s]  the quantum shuttle. You found the gravity cannon. I recalled a Nomai shuttle from the quantum moon.
[15324.95s -> 15338.41s]  A Nomai named Solanum landed at her shuttle at the quantum moon's south pole and prepared to make
[15338.41s -> 15342.41s]  the rest of the journey on foot. Visitors to the quantum moon always arrive at the south pole for
[15342.41s -> 15348.70s]  reasons unknown. The quantum moon sometimes disappears possibly to an unknown sixth location.
[15349.74s -> 15356.95s]  Nomai detected a quantum signal coming from somewhere on Giants deep.
[15362.23s -> 15371.08s]  Where's the quantum McDonald's? That's pretty good.
[15371.80s -> 15379.90s]  Okay. I'm gonna go do this. This is red for some reason and I glazed over this.
[15379.90s -> 15393.51s]  Ember Twin. Southern hemisphere. Let's go. All right. If you went up this quickly,
[15393.51s -> 15423.40s]  would your stomach go into your esophagus? Probably would. This one. Your brain would go into your
[15423.40s -> 15435.62s]  stomach. What the fuck, man? Why are you doing this to me? It's trying to kill me. It's trying
[15435.62s -> 15448.26s]  to kill me. Autopilot again. Just use autopilot, Jerma. It's easier. It won't magnetize you into
[15448.26s -> 15471.21s]  the sun. What a depressing replay. That's the kind of replay where you accidentally
[15471.21s -> 15476.73s]  recorded on the PS4 for five seconds. Ten seconds, you're like, how the fuck did I do that?
[15477.37s -> 15507.16s]  This is me sitting at the menu. Auto pilot. Not yet. Wait till I get to a safe place.
[15512.09s -> 15518.65s]  Okay. Engaging autopilot. No, don't do that. Stop. Turn it off. It's gonna go right in the fucking sun.
[15519.69s -> 15555.45s]  All right. Get on here. Land this thing. And there's the beacon of light right there.
[15556.73s -> 15579.27s]  Jesus Christ. Where am I? I thought I did it right. I thought I did it right.
[15583.43s -> 15603.75s]  I was going too fast. Autopilot. Okay. I'm good. Oh, Christ. Where's that thing coming from?
[15604.39s -> 15632.12s]  Where's that beacon? There's a light beacon. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? There it is.
[15632.12s -> 15649.75s]  Oh, that's different. What's that? Oh, look at that. All right. Land. Good. Get me the hell
[15649.75s -> 15667.86s]  out of here. Oh, find signal nearby. Frequency. Oh, is it one of these things? Escape pod.
[15667.86s -> 15688.65s]  Distress beacon. Escape pod. What happened? We need status reports for all systems.
[15688.73s -> 15693.61s]  The initial things first. Is everyone unharmed? Our escape pods passengers are afraid.
[15694.25s -> 15700.58s]  They're physically well. Inanna, everyone survived the crash. This is a relief at least.
[15700.58s -> 15704.90s]  You have my gratitude. Burr, we were able to find the other escape pods distress signals.
[15705.94s -> 15710.10s]  I can hear both signals somewhere in this star system, but I don't believe either escape pod
[15710.10s -> 15717.96s]  crashed on the same planet as us.
[15718.44s -> 15736.74s]  What is this? Too close to read. Launching escape pod three. Now launching escape pod two.
[15737.38s -> 15746.17s]  Collision imminent. Preparing for impact. Scanning external environment. Scan complete.
[15746.17s -> 15753.13s]  External temperature is prohibitively high. Verdict inhospitable. Do not seek shelter on
[15753.13s -> 15759.50s]  this planet. Escape pod two. Vessel has been mortally injured. Emergency sequence
[15759.50s -> 15769.99s]  activated. Awaiting departure from vessel. All right, so it hurt. All right, somebody got hurt.
[15776.18s -> 15783.22s]  Beat from the star system sun is more bearable below the surface. When our escape pod punctured
[15783.22s -> 15788.98s]  this planet's surface, it broke into what scans show is a cave system with much cooler air.
[15788.98s -> 15795.62s]  I would recommend we seek a site down there to build a long-term shelter.
[15796.50s -> 15805.66s]  Inanna, but these passages are a maze. Even with this danger, they are still our best chance for
[15805.66s -> 15810.86s]  survival. We'll form teams and descend into the caves to look for shelter. We can mark our findings
[15810.86s -> 15818.09s]  on the walls to avoid becoming irreversibly lost. Be cautious everyone and be aware of the sand as
[15818.09s -> 15850.66s]  you search. It appears to be rising gradually. There's a lot of writings down here. Put it away.
[15850.66s -> 15863.62s]  What's this? Emergency escape hatch. We have found an enormous cavern at the end of this passage
[15863.62s -> 15870.04s]  that appears promising. I believe we could construct long-term shelter there. Cavern
[15870.04s -> 15875.08s]  Malorre found. It's a wise choice for shelter. Could be... could one of you
[15875.08s -> 15880.89s]  mark directions for the others to follow? This is the start of the path to the shelter site.
[15880.89s -> 15886.47s]  I've left directions to guide you there. Of note, we must hurry as the pathway there is filling with
[15886.47s -> 15890.55s]  sand. Do not allow yourself to be buried by sand and make sure no one is lost.
[15891.43s -> 15903.32s]  Let's read everything. Do not follow this tunnel to its end.
[15903.32s -> 15909.56s]  Holius and I will examine the horror that lies in its terminus later. Why did we live through this?
[15910.12s -> 15918.76s]  We'll go down there. Keep moving, friends. There's nothing of interest at the end of this passage
[15918.76s -> 15924.09s]  but rocks. And while these rocks are interesting, they can wait until a less urgent time.
[15925.05s -> 15938.57s]  All right, what about over here? No, this passage leads to breathable air. Refill your supply tank
[15938.57s -> 15944.15s]  there. Cannot tell you how far or deep these tunnels may wind. Do not linger as the area is
[15944.15s -> 15960.86s]  exposed to the heat of this alien sun. All right, let's refill. Refill your air supply tank and
[15960.86s -> 15989.29s]  return quickly. Is there anything else out here? That's cool. There's something bad at the end of
[15989.29s -> 16047.53s]  this tunnel. Do I dare do this? I said don't do this. I don't get it. Why? Well, I can't go down
[16047.53s -> 16070.14s]  here anyway. I can't like go through here. Well, I'm gonna go down the path. Let's get oxygen first.
[16070.14s -> 16074.62s]  Which way is oxygen? This way, right? Which way? This way? That way? This way? There's oxygen.
[16074.62s -> 16088.97s]  Over here? This way? This way? Totally oxygen. Let's go down the path and see what we find.
[16091.98s -> 16117.82s]  Let's go. All right, watch out for the sand. Then move quickly because the sand is filling up.
[16119.46s -> 16133.88s]  Okay, over here. Watch out for the sand. All right, there's a spot over here. All right, guys,
[16134.52s -> 16144.15s]  I've gotten rings in Dark Souls that were harder than this. The path to the shelter site is somewhat
[16144.15s -> 16156.63s]  convoluted, so follow the instructions ahead closely. I wasn't making a joke. I'm just being
[16156.63s -> 16163.43s]  real. I mean, you do this in Dark Souls 2 to get shit, you know? Just saying.
[16164.39s -> 16175.86s]  Uh, reach the shelter site. Walk forward until you meet the sandfall at the pit.
[16177.61s -> 16183.13s]  Then turn left. Continue to the room filled with rock column formations and climb upward through
[16183.13s -> 16191.54s]  the opening above them. Sand here is rising, so you must be cautious with the swift. Forward
[16191.54s -> 16197.38s]  till you meet the sandfall. Forward until the pit. Turn left. Continue the room with rocks. Go up.
[16198.18s -> 16230.74s]  Sand pit left. Rocks. Rocks. Then go up. Go up. Are there any more instructions?
[16231.46s -> 16240.01s]  There we go. Be cautious crossing the chasm ahead. The bridge Malore and I crafted will do its job,
[16240.01s -> 16251.00s]  but it isn't strong. Oh, shit. Once on the far side, look for the tunnel hidden behind the falling
[16251.00s -> 16259.14s]  sand. Follow it and you'll reach the shelter. Can I walk on this shit? I just jump and...
[16259.30s -> 16289.43s]  Okay, now go behind the sand. Can I go, can I get back? Can I go behind this? Can I go behind that?
[16289.43s -> 16295.53s]  Does it go behind the sand? Is that gonna hurt me? Is that gonna kill me? Is it gonna kill me?
[16295.53s -> 16303.94s]  Holy fuck, I made it. I thought it was gonna kill me. You're doing well. There's only a little
[16303.94s -> 16307.94s]  farther left to go now until you reach the shelter site. You can rest there. Hurry before the sand
[16307.94s -> 16328.87s]  comes. Up there? How the hell did they make it up there? They built a shitty bridge there?
[16329.27s -> 16339.11s]  There? Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming.
[16339.11s -> 16346.63s]  Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming.
[16348.68s -> 16374.82s]  Open the door. Up? Which way? What is this? Hold on. Wait, what about up here? This is amazing.
[16374.82s -> 16378.50s]  Look inside the cave. How did this come to rest here? We haven't encountered others in this cave.
[16378.50s -> 16385.66s]  I think this is a rare find. From what we can see, Coleus and I believe the specimen must be very
[16385.66s -> 16393.67s]  old indeed. Imagine what we might learn if we could examine it. If we both agree it's unlikely
[16393.67s -> 16398.07s]  this dry planet is this horrors place of origin, especially considering what we observed during
[16398.07s -> 16404.34s]  the vessel's evacuation. Clearly this hole is too small for it to fit through. Hypothesis,
[16404.34s -> 16409.11s]  there's another entrance to this cave. If there is, Coleus and I will find it. We can't leave
[16409.11s -> 16415.27s]  valuable information undiscovered. Update. We need to find a way inside quickly.
[16415.99s -> 16420.07s]  Melore, because when I have returned here to search for an entrance to the cave there were
[16420.07s -> 16439.67s]  children playing on the specimen. I didn't need that info. Okay, well. All right, I don't want
[16439.67s -> 16448.87s]  to fall anywhere so I gotta be careful. I can't see shit. How about over? Hold on. Anglerfish
[16448.87s -> 16461.98s]  fossil overlook. Three? What? Only three minutes of oxygen. Hold on. What is this? Hold on.
[16469.69s -> 16479.64s]  What's this shit over here? Oxygen? Nope. There's shit over here. There's stuff over here.
[16482.46s -> 16491.96s]  Um, I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for. It's blind. I mean, I have tunnel vision right
[16491.96s -> 16513.05s]  now. I'm looking for a flashlight. How do I get in there? Holy fucking shit. I've got to get out
[16513.05s -> 16518.82s]  of here right now. How do I get out? How do I get out? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.
[16520.65s -> 16540.20s]  How do I get out of this? How do I get out of here? What the fuck? Hey, should we build a
[16540.20s -> 16544.76s]  sun station to the power of this Ash project? Are there any ways to generate this level of power?
[16544.76s -> 16547.88s]  Theoretically, as per our act, we know we can't imagine discovering anything like that.
[16547.88s -> 16550.84s]  I understand this proposal is not simple, but the sun station must be built if we hope to
[16550.84s -> 16555.32s]  complete the Ashman project. I almost can't comprehend this being the suggestion. So the
[16555.32s -> 16558.36s]  purpose of the sun station goes against every standard we hold ourselves to and everything
[16558.36s -> 16564.14s]  we believe. Unsurprisingly, I disagree if we're pushing a possible new technology further than
[16564.14s -> 16567.34s]  ever before. That, in my experience, is the defining characteristic of our species.
[16568.38s -> 16572.62s]  If we fail, and the probability of this is insignificant, we will without question destroy
[16572.62s -> 16575.98s]  ourselves. All life here and the rest of the star system I wish to protect these species.
[16577.18s -> 16581.10s]  The potential annihilation of an entire star system is too severe a cost. We shouldn't build
[16581.10s -> 16586.14s]  the sun station no matter how badly we want the knowledge that comes with it. Fear of failure is
[16586.14s -> 16589.82s]  a poor reason not to try. I believe, with curiosity, the sun station will be a work.
[16591.98s -> 16597.42s]  I'm deeply honored. I comprehend your position, however, if we aren't all but certain the sun
[16597.42s -> 16601.02s]  station will not cause destruction, once we build it then I won't support the station's use.
[16761.53s -> 16772.41s]  Sunless City. Anglerfish Fossil. Sun Station. You know my debate of building a sun station
[16772.41s -> 16798.09s]  in order to power the Ash Twin Project. Canyon at Ember Twin's Equator. Canyon at Ember Twin's Equator.
[16801.13s -> 16820.12s]  What are you doing? Well, it's full of sand now, so I don't think I can do much. I don't think I can
[16820.12s -> 16845.22s]  do anything else here. It's getting close. That thing's dumping sand. That's the other,
[16845.22s -> 16857.32s]  right, okay. So I have to go, I have to turn that sand off. I don't know. It's taking over
[16857.32s -> 16895.50s]  the whole planet. Wait, look at it. Where is it? Is that gonna keep going? Yeah, yeah, I'm dead.
[16897.13s -> 16900.89s]  Yeah, I'm dead. I'm just dead. All right, now for the next time, I know this is sad. I'm gonna go to
[16900.89s -> 16908.18s]  the, yeah, I'm just gonna bump my head a bunch more times. I'll be fine. Yeah, I mean, three
[16908.18s -> 16917.02s]  minutes remaining. Uh, actually, I might be able to get there. I wonder, should I fly to that planet?
[16924.18s -> 16947.11s]  Can I land on this? I wonder if I can actually get on top. I'll probably put your seatbelt on.
[16948.39s -> 16982.65s]  I haven't even looked at this yet. Hey, I remember this. I'm going in here. It's huge.
[16983.29s -> 17053.50s]  I mean, what's the purpose of this? The sun hungers. Uh, I think we're dead. What's the
[17053.50s -> 17111.93s]  significance of this place? Bye, everybody. Got it. Unreal Tournament map. So it's safe to say he
[17111.93s -> 17127.58s]  knows about the supernova now. Yeah, yeah, I'd say that's a pretty safe assessment. There it goes
[17127.58s -> 17138.06s]  again. I kind of want to investigate what that is. You know what I mean? I want to go just, I want
[17138.06s -> 17150.26s]  to go up there. That thing, I'm going up there. I want to know what that is. This thing keeps
[17150.26s -> 17172.76s]  exploding every time I die. Why? What's the point? Well, this is unknown. What's this unknown
[17172.76s -> 17186.94s]  signal? I can't slow down. Is it the ship itself doing that? No, it's something on that planet,
[17186.94s -> 17211.43s]  but I still want to know what this is. I'm going to hit the surface of this planet.
[17212.07s -> 17234.98s]  Oh, something in there. All right, something in there. It's going too fast. Wait, can I get
[17234.98s -> 17257.32s]  in there close? Where did it go? Where is it? What? What is going on? So we're getting sucked
[17257.32s -> 17283.30s]  into the gravity. Okay. Get over here. All right, there it is. Land on it. Land on it. I landed.
[17283.30s -> 17313.19s]  Did I? What's wrong? What happened? What? Uh, how did I? I didn't put the suit on. I, yeah, whatever.
[17313.19s -> 17318.28s]  And it took me so long to get there too. Well, look, it happened again.
[17324.15s -> 17327.59s]  I thought you were making that choking sound. I thought there was something in that hole
[17328.92s -> 17349.61s]  making that choking sound. All right, where is it? How come I can't see it?
[17350.41s -> 17357.66s]  Is it behind the moon thing? Whatever this is. There you go.
[17369.78s -> 17429.40s]  Come here. I screwed up this time. All right, let's check this place out. Damn it. My microphone's
[17429.40s -> 17434.76s]  been delayed by 650 milliseconds the whole stream because we played Xbox 360 yesterday.
[17435.96s -> 17461.06s]  You knew from the start. Let's do the whole stream again. God, I hate when that shit happens.
[17462.66s -> 17468.28s]  This capturing the 360, you have to delay your voice because it takes like almost a whole second
[17468.28s -> 17484.25s]  for the capture card to pull it into OBS. God damn it. Well, I found this. It wasn't that
[17484.25s -> 17493.22s]  noticeable. Well, it was definitely noticeable when I was just being missed by asteroids and
[17493.22s -> 17500.73s]  screaming almost a false second later. Here comes the asteroid. Oh, it just passed. Oh,
[17506.84s -> 17516.12s]  probe tracking module. I thought you were just slow. Like my brain. Sorry guys. Oh, that was
[17516.12s -> 17544.81s]  scary. Oh shit. Control module. Launch module. This thing. Fucking pea brain. Shatters through
[17544.81s -> 17568.50s]  the glass. All right. What should I go into? I'm going to go over here. All right. So this is,
[17569.22s -> 17628.92s]  I'm going to put this thing back together. I don't get it. I don't get it. It's different.
[17630.20s -> 17635.32s]  I have bad news. Yaro says there was a problem with the proposed power source.
[17635.96s -> 17645.58s]  So the orbital probe cannon won't be asked to fire. I hope you're pulling my locomotive limb here.
[17647.58s -> 17653.38s]  I wish I were my friend, but no, they aren't certain they can fix the problem. So the
[17653.38s -> 17663.29s]  orbitable probe cannon is on indefinite hiatus. Tell Privet and Malo, oh, they should return from
[17663.29s -> 17672.26s]  the cannon. My spouse and I were made at the construction yard for now. An update. Malo and
[17672.26s -> 17677.46s]  I will join you in Daz. Privet left to visit her brother. She fears Aidea may feel responsible.
[17678.58s -> 17691.69s]  Construction yard? What about this one? Does this one do anything for us?
[17707.91s -> 17730.71s]  Uh, can I read that? Well, we got some info. I guess we got some info. Okay, info. Got it.
[17730.71s -> 17737.86s]  It's been around back to where we were. This can go all the way.
[17738.98s -> 17753.86s]  I guess I'm going to put the marble through. You go down? What is that? Uh, that's a device
[17753.86s -> 17765.16s]  of some sort. With randomly selected probe trajectory, gravity field activated.
[17765.96s -> 17773.94s]  Five minutes 54 seconds ago, request to launch probe received from Ash Twin project.
[17774.74s -> 17798.50s]  Do the other one. So that's the cannon. Any more knowledge? Probe apart, as it didn't work.
[17799.46s -> 17807.27s]  Begin launch log. Orbital probe cannon. Launch request received. Probe launch successful.
[17807.83s -> 17812.98s]  Probe tracking module is receiving data from probe.
[17814.34s -> 17819.29s]  Orbital probe cannon structure compromised during launch. Damage to multiple modules detected.
[17820.41s -> 17845.13s]  Orbital probe cannon damage report. Severe structural stress detected.
[17845.29s -> 17847.85s]  Accessing damage to modules.
[17849.13s -> 17854.36s]  Probe module intact. No structural damage. Launch module. Viewport window fractured.
[17854.36s -> 17859.14s]  Module exposed to vacuum of space. Probe tracking module missing.
[17862.47s -> 17869.27s]  So wait, so this thing explodes every time I wake up and something shoots out of it.
[17870.98s -> 17880.92s]  Maybe I should follow that thing. I just try to chase that thing down? What just happened?
[17881.56s -> 17913.27s]  Well, my better 50%. The SAVA is sending the last of the cannon components soon.
[17913.83s -> 17916.79s]  Relatively speaking, we'll know the eye's precise location.
[17917.99s -> 17922.95s]  SAVA tells me he and the construction yard crew have determined a power setting we are not
[17924.34s -> 17932.07s]  under any circumstances to go above. I see. And am I right to think that consequently we'll
[17932.07s -> 17939.88s]  be ignoring that setting? Stupid. I can posit with nearly 100% certainty our friends have
[17939.88s -> 17947.29s]  accounted for our nature so I suggest we do. Giving the orbital probe cannon all the power
[17947.29s -> 17951.29s]  it can structurally withstand creates the greatest chance of finding the eye of the universe.
[17952.73s -> 17958.25s]  Yes, the probe must travel as fast as it can. As far as it can, I'll make some adjustments.
[17959.45s -> 17965.90s]  The thought of concluding our elders' curious and challenging search increases my heart's
[17965.90s -> 17975.46s]  temperature. My love. They're trying to find the center of the universe. They found it. They
[17975.46s -> 17980.58s]  went too deep. Caused a fucking time paradox and now I have to fix that. I have to be the one that
[17980.58s -> 17985.38s]  fucking closes the time loop because they screwed it all up. Because they shot whatever they shot.
[17986.26s -> 18001.27s]  What was that? Oh, these things I played on. All right, I'm going to the other module.
[18012.38s -> 18016.73s]  Really, I'm having a lot of fun playing the game. Get out of town.
[18017.53s -> 18044.14s]  Probe tracking. I don't think it exists anymore. I think it's broken. In fact,
[18044.14s -> 18046.06s]  I don't think this is a good idea, but I'm going to do it anyways.
[18046.78s -> 18068.22s]  The module is gone. Who would have thought? What about over here? This is where it fires from.
[18069.10s -> 18080.01s]  All right, is there something I missed in here? There's another section I could go in, right?
[18080.81s -> 18091.19s]  It's tracking this launching. And what was this one? This one I just came from?
[18093.27s -> 18098.95s]  Control module. It's this one up here. It's the one I had to go into, right? For a second,
[18098.95s -> 18110.22s]  I thought that was a probe module and I was like, what did I just find? Did I go in this one? No,
[18110.30s -> 18136.89s]  I can't. This is blocked off too. All right, nothing in here anymore. Wait, wait. All right,
[18136.89s -> 18145.82s]  I'm getting it out of here. I went in all the modules, right? But for this one, I'm kind of
[18145.82s -> 18158.62s]  getting turned around on the other side. Yeah, I need fuel. I got to go to the ship.
[18176.57s -> 18190.52s]  Okay, um, oh god, I'm just stretching my back a little. Should I stay? Let me try going that
[18190.52s -> 18211.96s]  other side. So I got to fire on the moon. So I got to go around. I go from here and just fly
[18211.96s -> 18230.52s]  it down here, right? I need to go in the window. Is this the right side? Where was that window?
[18231.16s -> 18248.66s]  Where was that correct window with the scout there? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[18249.30s -> 18279.10s]  What's in here? More stuff. Okay. Imagine, Privet, the probe tracking module will be the first to
[18279.10s -> 18284.31s]  know the coordinates of the eye of the universe. You'll be the first to see them. Honored and
[18284.31s -> 18289.54s]  terrified. You won't ask the orbital probe cannon to use so much power that it breaks, will you?
[18290.42s -> 18297.34s]  Right? Not my nervous friend. We only need to fire the probe once. Anyway, so who minds if it
[18297.34s -> 18304.25s]  compromises the cannon's structural integrity? I would mind, Malo. I would mind because we won't
[18304.25s -> 18308.57s]  be capable of receiving our probe's data if the probe tracking module is destroyed.
[18308.57s -> 18344.63s]  Dummy. Oh, there's one floating. That's the statue. Okay. That was weird. Let's grab the other one.
[18345.27s -> 18374.86s]  What is this one? Let's try this one. What is that? What is that thing? I don't know. Let's go see
[18374.86s -> 18383.99s]  what they say. It's the other room. Malo, my better 50% cassava is sending the last of the
[18383.99s -> 18387.59s]  cannon components soon. We'll know the eye's location. Yeah. Didn't I already do this?
[18388.47s -> 18395.26s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Our elders curiosity. Construction yard, groove, a power setting.
[18395.26s -> 18413.14s]  Didn't I already do this? Percent certainty. Yeah, I did this already. Okay. It's the other side.
[18413.86s -> 18429.16s]  Can I do anything over here? Are you reading somebody else's DMs? Well, what else is there
[18429.16s -> 18439.08s]  to do in here? Besides this stuff. All right. I need to put this data in and see what the hell
[18439.08s -> 18443.75s]  I'm going to do next. I need to find this construction yard. I just broke my neck. I just
[18443.75s -> 18452.81s]  shattered my fucking all my vertebrae in the top. All right, I made it out. Now let's go to the
[18452.81s -> 18477.59s]  ship. This data that I thought I was gonna get crushed. Input the data. I got a lot of it.
[18478.15s -> 18491.74s]  What do we got now? Probe cannon, tracking module, control module, construction yard.
[18492.70s -> 18500.20s]  You know, I built the orbit probe cannon at a construction yard on giants deep.
[18502.01s -> 18516.36s]  All right. I know where we're going. Question. No spoilers. But how far into the game am I
[18516.36s -> 18534.14s]  currently right now? Are we yet? Like, how far? Like percentage wise? And we're around 30 to 40%
[18535.10s -> 18551.51s]  35% 35. Okay. All right. 25 30% 25%. Okay. Just making sure that I don't go too far. So this
[18551.51s -> 18565.77s]  because I want to stream this tomorrow too. I just exploded. All right. We want to go to that.
[18565.77s -> 18572.84s]  What was it called? Giants? Giants deep, right? That's right there. All right. So we're gonna
[18572.84s -> 18589.00s]  find this construction yard. This planet that's all water. Construction yard. Navigate this
[18590.28s -> 18607.91s]  construction yard. No, but I mean, it looks like there's something. Hold on.
[18608.63s -> 18617.13s]  I'm gonna land here. Have I been here before? I don't remember if I've been here before.
[18618.09s -> 18657.34s]  What is happening? This is in this part of the planet. What the fuck am I?
[18657.90s -> 18670.41s]  There's a landing pad. The landing pad doesn't solve the problem of the whole island getting
[18670.41s -> 18689.82s]  picked up and thrown into space. I'll park damn thing on the pad. Hold on. All right. I'm in the
[18689.82s -> 18708.33s]  pad. This whole thing can get picked up and get thrown into space. Is this a construction yard?
[18708.81s -> 18721.08s]  Am I getting a jetpack tutorial booster? Okay. Oh my god. I'm so embarrassed because it's like
[18721.08s -> 18725.56s]  popped up on the screen and fucked with my head. I'm so actually embarrassed right now.
[18726.84s -> 18730.52s]  I'm annoyed by that. I can't believe it. It popped up on the screen. I was like, why is it showing
[18730.52s -> 18743.14s]  this? I've done this a hundred times. Yes. Hold. RT. Hold. Yes. Guys. Guys. I don't know why.
[18743.94s -> 18746.82s]  I don't understand why I'm doing that. I don't get it. I don't understand. I've done this
[18747.22s -> 18752.26s]  a thousand times. I've jumped like 50 fucking gaps. Is this text? Why is the text even on
[18752.26s -> 18769.43s]  the screen right now? Why is it doing this to me? Oh, it's the huge gravity. Right. I forgot. It's
[18769.43s -> 18778.28s]  the only planet that I've got. Oh my god. I forgot. This planet has like times 10 gravity.
[18778.28s -> 18826.17s]  The only one that does. Statue workshop. Ooh, that's broken. Can you get in? That was easy.
[18826.17s -> 18846.10s]  I'm going to jump over there. Block this way. Tree's detected. All right. Nice.
[18846.98s -> 18858.30s]  Destruction site. Oh, I've never seen this in my dream.
[18871.10s -> 18877.98s]  Text. We're going to test the memory statues tonight. Block says it could be dangerous,
[18877.98s -> 18884.20s]  so we can't. I'm dead. Well, what if we don't see the door and sneak the other way around?
[18884.76s -> 18888.28s]  We really want to see the test too, Liam, but that's a huge risk to take. We probably shouldn't
[18888.28s -> 18893.08s]  make flocks. Maybe flocks will let us test it later. Block specifically told us not to do that.
[18893.64s -> 18896.44s]  We're going to test the memory statues tonight. Be dangerous.
[18897.40s -> 18912.97s]  I only got the clue at least. Yeah. Memory statues.
[18934.07s -> 18957.42s]  Every time I tune in, you die. There it goes. All right. I'm going to go back there.
[18960.04s -> 18970.84s]  That's your workshop. That's your island. I energy lab. So these are going to connect eventually
[18970.84s -> 18978.44s]  here. That's your workshop leads to gabbro. Find steep to learn more about the statue.
[18978.44s -> 18983.16s]  That's your leads to here. You lead to statue island, which leads to the energy lab, which
[18983.16s -> 18989.00s]  leads to the station, which then leads to the sun station. And then the whole game is you've
[18989.00s -> 19010.50s]  completed the whole game. I'm going to head back there. The giant steep. I want to explore the
[19010.50s -> 19047.30s]  statue. Unknown. Still looking for whatever this is. The secret moon. Still have to go back there
[19047.30s -> 19059.35s]  and look at stuff. All right. Let's land. You didn't turn the stone off. Stove up. We're going
[19059.35s -> 19068.94s]  to space. Sorry. Back going so fast. I almost got dumped. Good. All right. Let's find where's
[19068.94s -> 19080.12s]  that little island again? Statue Island. That's right here. Slow down a little. That's actually
[19080.12s -> 19091.51s]  not it. Something else. Something else. I'm going to check it out. So many things to look at.
[19091.51s -> 19110.25s]  Here's the question. Let's go downstairs. Now this is what I saw in there. There's dead bodies
[19110.25s -> 19122.52s]  here. All right. The tornado is giants deep. That's that symbol. If you were holding this.
[19123.24s -> 19134.86s]  This is it. We finished building the final orbital probe cannon module and are ready to send it into
[19134.86s -> 19141.91s]  orbit around giant steep for assembly. The next step would be to send privet up to the orbit of
[19141.91s -> 19148.34s]  probe cannon to install the probe tracking system. All my friends here at the construction yard,
[19148.34s -> 19154.02s]  which is here, my gratitude for your tireless work. I've given up hope, but I truly believe
[19154.02s -> 19160.28s]  this cannon may actually succeed where many other attempts have not. I know my brother
[19160.28s -> 19164.68s]  Avans and his spells will want to launch the probe with as much power as possible and where the
[19164.68s -> 19171.18s]  cannon would break under the station. I propose we give Avans and Malo a slightly lower maximum
[19171.18s -> 19175.02s]  power setting than the absolute maximum possible to create room for their enthusiasm.
[19176.14s -> 19182.54s]  Not on the same page. Are you going gelatinous on us, love? I'm delighted by your words,
[19182.54s -> 19189.22s]  but they're atypical for you. Ever half as gooey as Malo and Avans behave together,
[19189.22s -> 19196.15s]  Daz. I mean, launch me from the orbital probe cannon. We know this is the construction yard.
[19197.11s -> 19198.15s]  That much is certain.
[19237.11s -> 19261.00s]  I don't like this. I want office to ride as soon as possible. What's happening? It's a twister.
[19261.80s -> 19271.22s]  I'm safe. You know, there's probably only, I get it. I get it somehow.
[19273.30s -> 19279.62s]  When you go up in the air, it's your opportunity to fly somewhere else you cannot get under any
[19279.62s -> 19288.92s]  of the circumstances. Long range probe successfully launched from the orbital probe cannon.
[19290.92s -> 19303.05s]  We've got bad news. Yaro says there was a problem with the proposed power source,
[19303.05s -> 19306.33s]  so the orbital probe cannon won't be asked to fire.
[19307.53s -> 19310.50s]  People following my locomotive ring? Yeah, this is the, we saw this.
[19311.46s -> 19314.74s]  Burned from the cannon. My spells never remain at the construction yard.
[19315.54s -> 19319.05s]  Wish I were my friend, but no, they certainly didn't do the problem.
[19320.01s -> 19322.17s]  Yeah, so this was where we have the building.
[19326.73s -> 19343.35s]  So another person's house. Yes, but we can do this. That brings us over here.
[19344.39s -> 19368.07s]  What is this? Why is it still picking up the guy from 12 million meters away doing the harmonica?
[19369.19s -> 19383.53s]  There's a crystal here as well. I could do that after this. All right, I'm gonna,
[19384.89s -> 19388.82s]  I'm gonna make the jump over here when we go up.
[19390.46s -> 19405.22s]  Right now, I could use this for a second. I could walk it. Yeah, I could just walk it, couldn't I?
[19406.02s -> 19449.86s]  I detected. Thanks for the oxygen. Can I make this jump on the other side?
[19449.86s -> 19454.63s]  Anything back there? There it is. Discs.
[19455.43s -> 19462.06s]  Now I gotta bring this disc out to the other side and play the movie.
[19463.02s -> 19476.39s]  I can have one of those somewhere around here. All right, bring it back to the other side.
[19477.19s -> 19497.77s]  Guys, let's go. Movie night.
[19508.70s -> 19515.56s]  How would I go through the water? I don't know. I did though, didn't I?
[19516.87s -> 19519.03s]  All right, new conversation. What is it?
[19546.86s -> 19551.18s]  Fire constructed a model of giants deep here at the Brittle Hollow's Southern Observatory.
[19554.04s -> 19557.16s]  And it reveals how an object might sink below the current.
[19559.51s -> 19562.63s]  I'm unable to grasp the answer by looking through the projection pool.
[19562.63s -> 19564.95s]  If I visit the observatory, would you kindly explain?
[19566.23s -> 19569.35s]  If you don't mind the trek beneath the surface to the south pole,
[19569.35s -> 19573.35s]  I'd be delighted to see you. The trailhead starts at Brittle Hollow's equator.
[19574.07s -> 19579.54s]  I don't know. You should have seen it.
[19579.54s -> 19581.94s]  We thought it was impossible for any cannon components to sink,
[19581.94s -> 19584.74s]  even for us to look below the current. But I sank straight to the core.
[19585.78s -> 19610.42s]  Interesting. This looks like that place I need to go.
[19611.14s -> 19620.18s]  Cool. All right. Well, now I got some data and now I'm going to move.
[19620.82s -> 19634.82s]  That's right. I'm going to go check that out. Walk across the top.
[19635.70s -> 19645.29s]  Let's do that. Cool. What is that? I think we're about to go in space.
[19650.63s -> 19652.97s]  Why is that active now? Why are these active?
[19653.61s -> 19656.52s]  Hold on a second. These are now activated.
[19666.62s -> 19677.16s]  Stasis machines? All right. I'm going back to the ship.
[19677.96s -> 19685.30s]  I don't know why I'm bringing this with me, but I guess I am.
[19685.30s -> 19693.99s]  The instruction here connects to the Southern Observatory,
[19693.99s -> 19695.43s]  which connects to ocean depths.
[19696.31s -> 19703.66s]  Not something to sink beneath the underwater current,
[19703.66s -> 19705.18s]  which they previously thought was impossible.
[19707.06s -> 19712.60s]  Southern Observatory. Brittle's Hollow's south pole.
[19713.40s -> 19719.78s]  The observatory, yeah, it's broken.
[19720.74s -> 19726.22s]  The model of giants deep that revealed how an object might sink below the strong current.
[19726.78s -> 19730.46s]  So I can't get in here. I have to go through the secret entrance.
[19732.14s -> 19741.66s]  There's all this shit down here too. Sun station.
[19744.18s -> 19748.86s]  They debated building a sun station. Wait a minute.
[19754.06s -> 19764.28s]  You built a station on the sun. Let's go look.
[19769.98s -> 19791.00s]  If you did, then you did, right? What's going on?
[19791.00s -> 19804.20s]  Why am I rotating? Okay. I finally escaped.
[19806.50s -> 19813.66s]  Sun station. Can I get close enough to the sun to find this?
[19814.46s -> 19828.94s]  I mean, I guess it looks like there's something right here.
[19830.14s -> 19837.53s]  Or is that just flames? This might just be flames.
[19844.87s -> 19853.08s]  I guess it just sucked me in. It just inhaled me.
[19860.76s -> 19861.96s]  It's going too fast.
[19864.90s -> 19875.99s]  Shit. We're going 300 meters a second and it didn't slow down.
[19875.99s -> 19886.18s]  I mean, I was holding the back button. I'm going to try. The sun is small now.
[19886.74s -> 19891.10s]  Let's try it now. Sun station.
[19891.82s -> 19897.29s]  I don't think there's anything on there. Maybe it's just barely off the surface.
[19902.47s -> 19922.12s]  Go to the sun at night when it's not hot. Yeah, you're right. That's not a bad idea.
[19929.78s -> 19935.94s]  That scared the fucking shit out of me. That scared the shit out of me.
[19937.14s -> 19942.82s]  What? Oh my God. There was no way in my brain that that was going to happen.
[19943.86s -> 19983.74s]  Okay. I mean, I don't see anything. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's that?
[19984.86s -> 19990.78s]  What is that? Wait, wait, wait, wait. There's something orbiting.
[19990.78s -> 19994.60s]  What is that? What's that? Sun station?
[20002.50s -> 20008.62s]  That's going way too up. I can't land on that. Are you kidding me?
[20009.26s -> 20020.17s]  I'm on fire. You can and you will.
[20021.05s -> 20040.92s]  Where is it? Man, I'm trying to pull up. I'm sucked in. I'm trying to just like kind of float.
[20040.92s -> 20056.36s]  That's moving so fast. So I have to match that. It's super hard to land on it.
[20057.18s -> 20061.02s]  I'll try it one more time, but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that.
[20062.38s -> 20070.95s]  I'll give it a try. I have to be going with it, not against it.
[20071.83s -> 20076.07s]  At least I know where it is. Maybe I should just ditch the...
[20076.79s -> 20102.84s]  No, that's not going to work. Okay. There it is. I need to be going along with it.
[20102.84s -> 20110.84s]  We have to spin this way. I'm going to slow down and I'm going to be moving with the bad
[20110.84s -> 20124.84s]  things of orbit. I prefer to come back so I can tell what the hell it's doing.
[20125.88s -> 20135.66s]  Kerbal space program? No, I try to play Kerbal space program. I uninstall the game after 15 minutes.
[20136.46s -> 20148.82s]  There it is. All right. Am I going to start burning here? Yep. Oh, fuck. Up, up, up, up, up,
[20148.82s -> 20166.09s]  up, up, up, up. Please. Am I going to land on this thing? No way. No way. You can't do this shit.
[20168.54s -> 20197.05s]  I'm going to have to crash into the thing. Where is it? Where is it? Where'd it go? I just circled
[20197.05s -> 20204.57s]  the damn thing like a full time. Oh, come on. It was right behind me. Oh, God. Damn you. Damn you.
[20205.53s -> 20221.43s]  This is hard. I can't really park either because I'm going to get sucked into the orbit. I just
[20221.43s -> 20231.98s]  have to try to stay up. I'm trying to... I'm just holding right trigger right now. Just skim like
[20231.98s -> 20240.34s]  this and then wait for it. No, it's just so hard to tell how much you're moving. I'm holding down
[20240.34s -> 20244.98s]  left trigger right now. I'm holding it as hard as I can. I have no idea even where I am.
[20245.94s -> 20268.76s]  That's seriously fucking insanely... I don't think I can do that.
[20273.30s -> 20296.47s]  Speed around the sun? It's pulling you down. Too much math. Too dangerous.
[20297.83s -> 20301.11s]  I'm going to try this one more time. I'm just going to speed along the surface of the sun.
[20301.11s -> 20316.41s]  While I hold right trigger. Space is just so disorienting. For instance, I just put that on
[20316.41s -> 20329.43s]  the sun. I have no idea where it is. Oh, there it is. All right. I'm going for it. Maybe I should
[20329.43s -> 20345.99s]  just crash into it. It's the big orange thing. All right. Well, let me see where the trajectory is.
[20349.02s -> 20367.51s]  I'm apparently still going too fast. There it is. All right. If I just hold down right...
[20368.31s -> 20373.67s]  I'm holding down forward right now. I'm just speeding forward. I just got launched out.
[20374.55s -> 20387.08s]  I don't think you're supposed to do this like this. You probably teleport onto this thing.
[20388.44s -> 20395.11s]  You definitely teleport from a different location onto this. There's no way this is what you're
[20395.11s -> 20411.75s]  supposed to do. No way. Because even if I catch up to it... All right. What's going on? I'm
[20411.75s -> 20416.23s]  fucking holding down right trigger right now. I'm holding right trigger. What? What?
[20417.03s -> 20420.07s]  All right. I'm done. I'm not doing it anymore. I'll teleport into the fucking thing like I'm
[20420.07s -> 20427.69s]  supposed to do in like three hours. In like four and a half hours when I teleport to that station,
[20427.69s -> 20452.58s]  that's when we'll do it. Cool. I can't even like try to fly it along the coast of the sun.
[20453.30s -> 20457.06s]  I can't think of any more things that would be stupid to do as an astronaut.
[20459.99s -> 20463.59s]  No, why don't we just like skim the fucking surface of the sun, Greg?
[20464.47s -> 20480.25s]  That's a good idea. Oh, don't worry. I'm a good pilot. I actually want to do...
[20481.21s -> 20509.46s]  Wait, let me... All right. The sand place. All right. Energy lab. All right. Yeah. I wanted to
[20509.46s -> 20516.60s]  do this. I want to go to the statue place. Where's that statue? Did I already do it? No,
[20516.60s -> 20531.78s]  no, no, no. I got sidetracked. Where is it? Six location. My energy lab. There. Statue workshop.
[20532.58s -> 20540.63s]  All right. I want to go back to Statue Island. And that's on that tornado planet. Cool.
[20554.63s -> 20561.35s]  I just took my eyes off the road. That was not... No, it's my controller. What the fuck?
[20563.14s -> 20575.45s]  Okay. Why is this happening again? I fixed this shit already. Give me a break, man.
[20576.25s -> 20594.57s]  Why did I get... Good start. Just like looking at my watch. Fucking goodness. Okay. Yeah. I think
[20594.57s -> 20597.53s]  I'm using the... I think I'm using the cord that... Remember I told you that I was having problems
[20597.53s -> 20604.54s]  with my controller. I had to get a new cord. I think I'm using the old cord because there's
[20606.44s -> 20615.48s]  shit everywhere in this room. I think I've replaced the cord with the old cord.
[20615.48s -> 20636.46s]  Let's try this again. Bad craftsman blames his tools. Well, no, this is the equivalent of you
[20636.46s -> 20643.34s]  using a hammer and the hammer disappears out of your hand while you're about to swing into a nail
[20643.34s -> 20668.70s]  and you punch yourself in the dick. What? Quantum hammer. That was funny. Quantum hammer was funny.
[20668.70s -> 20673.42s]  All right. I got to pay attention. Stop, stop. I'm going too fast. How am I going this fast? How am
[20673.42s -> 20689.82s]  I going this fast? Okay. Statue Island. Quantum idiot. Enough, enough, enough, enough, enough,
[20689.90s -> 20695.64s]  enough, enough. I'll take your position into consideration.
[20706.02s -> 20723.34s]  There's one person in chat who knows what that was. Nice, nice Qbert reference. Thanks, man.
[20724.14s -> 20733.96s]  I love Qbert. By the way, Qbert got a real diverse shit end of the stick, didn't he?
[20735.80s -> 20742.50s]  Statue works at heart. Nobody gives a shit about Qbert. He is one of the original classic video
[20742.50s -> 20747.94s]  game characters and Mega Man's talked about every day. Pac-Man's talked about all the time.
[20748.82s -> 20752.34s]  Mario's every like, what happened to Qbert? Why does nobody like Qbert? Why Qbert not like
[20752.34s -> 20759.06s]  his show up in anything? I think the only time Qbert's shown up in any new media is I think they
[20759.06s -> 20774.01s]  like punched him in the face and family guy because he swears. It's not even a real square.
[20774.01s -> 20781.56s]  It's like a comedy square. He's in a wreck at Ralph. Imagine your first real appearance
[20782.82s -> 20803.11s]  in two, three decades. He's on Wreck-It Ralph. All right, let's open up the... Now I got a minute.
[20803.67s -> 20810.63s]  Let's read this because I didn't get to read this whole thing last time. Henry's statues. Yeah,
[20810.63s -> 20817.59s]  but what if we didn't use the other, the door and snuck in the other way? Does anyone want to?
[20818.63s -> 20825.67s]  He said don't do that. Really want to see the test too, Lanny, but that's a huge risk we take. We
[20825.67s -> 20843.54s]  probably shouldn't maybe walk, so let us see a later test. Shit. All right, there's a way over
[20843.54s -> 20860.76s]  there. Door's broken, but there's another way to go. But where is that other way? Fuck, Qbert.
[20870.84s -> 20880.58s]  What are some of the video game characters that really should have followed into
[20881.46s -> 20900.66s]  this current popular culture but never did? Frogger? Yeah, Frogger was another one, isn't it?
[20900.66s -> 20903.94s]  Oh wait, wait a minute. I know what to do. I know what to do. I know what to do. I know what to do.
[20903.94s -> 20928.49s]  Look. Where is it? Find it. Where's the secret entrance? Oh shit, we're going down. That's the
[20928.49s -> 20966.68s]  right idea though. That's the right idea. Got it. All right, what about uh, this thing? Wait, how
[20966.68s -> 20981.03s]  much further down is this? I can find distress beacons too? Shit. This is nuts. Yara, would you
[20981.03s -> 20986.15s]  kindly step back so Daz is closest to the statue? When pairing, the statue will choose whoever is
[20986.15s -> 20994.09s]  in closest proximity. See how its eyes have opened? That tells us the statue is paired with Daz.
[20994.97s -> 21001.37s]  Now, no matter where he is in this star system, Daz's statue will record his memories and send
[21001.37s -> 21012.86s]  them to the Ash Twin Project. This is extraordinary sculpting work, Vox. He has outdone himself again,
[21012.86s -> 21018.22s]  hasn't he? And now that we have our first successful pairing, we can test my memory storage
[21018.22s -> 21025.83s]  prototype. Each statue will send a single Nomai's memories to his or her own storage unit
[21026.63s -> 21034.86s]  within the Ash Twin. Each storage unit will be equipped with a mask, the statue's counterpart,
[21035.66s -> 21039.90s]  which will be able to send those stored memories back to the corresponding Nomai.
[21039.90s -> 21058.50s]  What the heck, dude? So I have, I have like a USB drive on the Ash Twin. Is this supposed to be me?
[21059.22s -> 21069.02s]  Okay, so we go from my brain, it sees me, it sees everything that I've done in every set and done,
[21069.82s -> 21086.12s]  and puts it onto the cloud, just like Google does. This is all for ad tracking. Okay, so I gotta find
[21086.44s -> 21092.62s]  the, on the Ash Twin. Now I know, I have my own personal USB drive on the Ash Twin. This just got
[21092.62s -> 21106.84s]  way more interesting right now. Right now I'm sitting there going, oh fuck, I gotta get there,
[21106.84s -> 21110.92s]  I gotta get there so I can delete all the times I went to the bathroom. I don't want to be seeing
[21110.92s -> 21124.54s]  that. I've installed the masks inside the Ash Twin Project, but the only plus two I got for that one
[21124.54s -> 21130.66s]  was from VR Josh. Everybody else did minus twos. That was a lot of minus twos in a row. Yeah,
[21131.46s -> 21144.07s]  all right, fine. Jeremiah, has anyone ever told you that you look like, you look like
[21144.07s -> 21152.65s]  Jeremy Albertson? That's me. All right, I've installed the masks inside the Ash Twin Project.
[21153.21s -> 21158.23s]  They look beautiful, although I do feel as though I'm being observed. It's comforting to know the
[21158.23s -> 21163.91s]  statues will not pair until the project succeeds, otherwise I imagine the experience would be hard
[21163.91s -> 21171.06s]  to endure. Ideally, they'll only need to activate once the project succeeds as a safety measure.
[21171.06s -> 21178.18s]  However, the statues will also activate in the event of the equipment failure. They will? Why
[21178.18s -> 21185.29s]  is that? If anything goes wrong with the Ash Twin Project, the statues and their masks will make us
[21185.29s -> 21190.01s]  aware of the situation and enable us to fix it. Otherwise, it would be possible for us to remain
[21190.01s -> 21195.48s]  permanently unaware of the problem. I hadn't thought of that. What a profoundly horrific fate
[21195.48s -> 21220.17s]  that would be. We're gonna store our, is there one of those things? This. Wait, every time I die,
[21220.17s -> 21240.22s]  I see this. And we fly through one of the holes. Okay, so those are the USB drives then. What's
[21240.22s -> 21255.56s]  up there? I can open this. On the other side. Hey, cool. All right, there's something else up here.
[21256.44s -> 21269.77s]  Okay, I thought, hear me out on this. This is gonna be hard maybe for me to describe or for you to see,
[21270.73s -> 21276.63s]  but that's a person with an astronaut helmet on with two arms sticking out and two legs.
[21276.71s -> 21281.19s]  That's a scout. And I was just like, there's a person here. This is, I gotta talk to the scout.
[21283.02s -> 21291.00s]  Ready? Left arm is right here. Right arm is right here. Hold on, let me do this from the mouse.
[21292.60s -> 21299.35s]  Right arm right here. Left arm right here. There's the head. There's like the end of the helmet.
[21301.22s -> 21317.98s]  Left leg, right leg. You're a psycho. I have to be a psycho every time. I wanna get up there.
[21317.98s -> 21340.65s]  I wanna get up there. I wanna get up there. Oh, this is how to get up there.
[21342.01s -> 21362.95s]  Read it. I'm curious, is sending a being's memories back in time the same as sending
[21362.95s -> 21371.13s]  the being itself back in time? As an example, if we were to send my memories back in time,
[21371.13s -> 21378.38s]  is that the same as sending me back in time? I imagine they're two different actions.
[21379.10s -> 21383.90s]  Wouldn't both actions be effectively the same?
[21389.46s -> 21395.27s]  Suppose that time was being rewritten. I believe this is different than receiving memories from
[21395.27s -> 21401.48s]  what is effectively the future. But isn't the end result identical in either case?
[21413.69s -> 21422.60s]  So they're sending memories back, but not a person? Does that make sense? Get out of here.
[21423.24s -> 21459.93s]  My leg. It's because it's quantum. Right, I forgot. What? Oxygen. Let's dump it into the computer.
[21461.45s -> 21474.14s]  Statue Workshop brings us over to Ash Twin Project. Every memory recorded by a
[21474.14s -> 21480.81s]  Nomai statue is transmitted to a corresponding storage unit within Ash Twin. I think that,
[21480.81s -> 21498.31s]  look at how big that one is. This is a mystery one. All right, let's go. Ash Twin. Ash Twin
[21498.31s -> 21512.09s]  Project. Okay. Right, right, right, right. Let's see. Okay. Where is it? Ash Twin. See, Jar Jar is the
[21513.51s -> 21532.49s]  whole thing here. Where is it? Ash Twin. Did I get it? Jar Jar is the key doll. It's at the
[21532.49s -> 21550.52s]  line problem. What did I say? What did I say? What did I say? Jar Jar is the whole thing.
[21555.02s -> 21561.93s]  Jar Jar is the whole thing here. Okay. Nobody just said this is the longest dream we've ever had.
[21562.57s -> 21571.70s]  Um, don't, I do not think so. No, there's been six hours. The longest dream was about 13 and a half.
[21571.70s -> 21582.79s]  All right, engaging autopilot. Let's go. Not even the longest dream this week. Yeah, yesterday was
[21582.79s -> 21587.82s]  like eight and a half, seven and a half. All right, go to Ash Twin and let's go. I want to go to the
[21587.82s -> 21603.05s]  USB storage. Okay, stop autopilot. I'm going to get the sun. Sun time. Sun time. Sun time. No,
[21603.05s -> 21635.70s]  it's not sun time. Hi. What's going on? Um, what's happening? Um, just get over there.
[21638.23s -> 21651.11s]  Dude can't even fall into the sun right. Shaking my fucking head. All the inertia.
[21659.03s -> 21666.07s]  When you're going 600 miles a second, you can't instantly start going the opposite direction.
[21669.83s -> 21675.43s]  Uh, but why is it doing this? I'm, I'm holding buttons to the right. I swear to God,
[21675.43s -> 21682.22s]  this is not, I swear to God, I'm doing, I'm, I'm not doing this. I'm holding the fucking button,
[21682.22s -> 21703.42s]  man. I'm going way too fast. I'm holding back. Okay, we're going to find them.
[21706.50s -> 21715.43s]  Okay, slow down and land. All right, good. Nice. Okay, get the fuck out of here.
[21718.34s -> 21731.03s]  We're looking for this place, place here somewhere on this planet.
[21731.91s -> 21755.51s]  It's the massive, it's a USB room. What's that over there? Oh, I can't get into any of these.
[21763.51s -> 21781.94s]  Wait here. It's connecting me necessarily. I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for.
[21792.04s -> 21795.24s]  This is the only thing I've been able to find here. This shit.
[21796.20s -> 21820.95s]  But this doesn't really lead me anywhere. It's a bridge. Unless there's a sound cave shard
[21820.95s -> 21842.41s]  down there. This thing's getting too big. Stress beam unknown. I'm like, look, this is
[21843.37s -> 21857.75s]  I've never been in here. Look at that. Found something. Here's our first delivery.
[21858.55s -> 21865.13s]  One warp core fresh from the black hole forge. Rude is installing this core sibling on Brittle
[21865.13s -> 21871.61s]  Hollow as I write this. I gratitude Larry, but this the Ashtman project is underway.
[21872.57s -> 21878.87s]  I confess I'm deeply curious about what you and Pokey found on the white hole station that
[21878.87s -> 21885.91s]  started this project. I visit some time to learn more. I recommend you do. The white hole station
[21885.91s -> 21891.27s]  is the model for the towers being built. The Ashtman project. The visit to the station would
[21891.27s -> 21898.58s]  be doubly useful. I suppose more precisely, I would like to visit the white hole station with you,
[21898.58s -> 21905.82s]  Larry. I'd be happy to explain our findings. Here, stop using the scroll wall to flirt with my sister
[21906.62s -> 21913.50s]  and go meet her on the white hole station. I wish I could wait here for you to arrive,
[21913.50s -> 21923.69s]  but the forge and my unfinished work is calling on return with more materials soon. I needed to
[21923.69s -> 21932.65s]  learn. End of the stream song. I think that's, I really, really needed that info too, so that's
[21932.65s -> 21961.22s]  good. Now we just die. I have to watch it. I'm gonna be out of view. There it goes.
[21966.65s -> 21994.44s]  Then we fly through one of these masks, which is a USB slot. Then we go through some weird portal.
[21995.40s -> 22019.69s]  Our memories have been played to somebody. We go back in time. Memories have gone back in time.
[22019.69s -> 22031.67s]  We have shot the cannon. Okay, let's download this data. Dude, you keep dying. You suck at this game.
[22034.81s -> 22042.50s]  Yeah, I know. It's kind of tricky. I know what you mean, though. All right, what we got?
[22042.50s -> 22054.41s]  Ash Twin Towers. What we got? Ash Twin Towers. Black Hole Forge. White Hole Station Energy Lab.
[22055.37s -> 22063.13s]  Black Hole Station. No minecrafted warp cores at the Black Hole Forge before delivering them to Ash
[22063.13s -> 22074.87s]  Twin. All right, I gotta do this one. My energy lab in the canyon at Ember Twin's equator. In the
[22074.87s -> 22099.66s]  canyon. We gotta go now. Canyon at Ember Twin's equator. Nice to land on somebody. Turn off auto
[22099.66s -> 22122.36s]  pilot. You just killed the dude. No, I didn't. I did not. It's not true. I did not. All right,
[22122.36s -> 22128.09s]  abort, abort. It's right in the way. How do you not see this golf ball that's in the way?
[22128.09s -> 22135.22s]  Auto pilot. Stupid thing. All right, in the canyon. How does that look for a canyon?
[22135.78s -> 22148.10s]  How does that look? In here. Gotta get into the canyon. Quickly, hurry up before all the
[22148.10s -> 22165.62s]  sand fills the hole. All right, into the canyon. In here. Now, where in here is it? Sit. Sit.
[22165.62s -> 22180.84s]  Got something.
[22214.25s -> 22218.81s]  It happened in an instant without warning. I turned away from Cole's to examine a sample and
[22218.81s -> 22223.05s]  when I turned back he wasn't there. He had a limited supply of air. I'm afraid for him.
[22224.01s -> 22229.29s]  Hypothesis. We will learn more by examining the northern lakebed cave where he disappeared.
[22229.29s -> 22247.11s]  Search quickly. We have no time. I already knew that info, but okay. Air is here. Quantum shard.
[22247.11s -> 22277.67s]  Unidentified signal. Unknown. Wait, this is known. I've already been up here. How is this
[22277.67s -> 22297.08s]  unknown? I've talked to this person already. Church, I have a question for you. I found
[22297.08s -> 22306.65s]  something. I found Nomai writing about the quantum moon. I've observed the quantum moon orbiting each
[22306.65s -> 22309.77s]  of the five planets, but sometimes it quite simply disappears from the sky. Maybe there's another
[22309.77s -> 22318.36s]  place it travels to. Unfortunately, there is. I've never seen it. Quantum shirt. Quantum shard.
[22318.36s -> 22337.83s]  Okay, there you go. You got it. You got your comedy for a full hour. You still don't. I'm,
[22337.83s -> 22352.33s]  I gotta find something here. I don't know. Okay, I need, I already got that cave shard.
[22353.21s -> 22360.62s]  All right, we gotta go, we gotta go north. Up here, down in this way, right? In there.
[22360.62s -> 22374.50s]  Cave shard. All right, that's enough out of you guys for tonight. That's enough out of you guys.
[22380.68s -> 22393.53s]  All right, stop. The comedy meter is falling. Okay, there's, there's the cave shard.
[22394.74s -> 22413.43s]  That's death. Let's just keep going this way. Here's the cave shard. No, I just, okay,
[22413.99s -> 22424.28s]  cave shard. Police is missing. He vanished from the lake bed cave, the one at the bottom of the
[22424.28s -> 22429.43s]  dry lake bed at the north pole a couple days ago, and we're unable to find a trace of him.
[22432.57s -> 22439.02s]  I beg you, if you're reading this, help us. This rock is familiar to you to travel here,
[22439.02s -> 22442.22s]  my sedimentary friend, because your unique color and texture appear identical to the rock I met
[22442.22s -> 22446.73s]  earlier. Isn't this the rock fragment of the cave we found at the bottom of the dry lake bed at the
[22446.73s -> 22454.57s]  north pole? We plan to re-examine the north, northern lake bed cave. Wow. And Malera and I
[22454.57s -> 22457.85s]  went back to the lake bed cave and observed this rock again. Sometimes it's there and sometimes
[22457.85s -> 22463.13s]  it's not. Now that means this rock wanders like the quantum moon does. How curious. Very curious,
[22463.13s -> 22469.54s]  indeed. It's gone and therefore it's now in the top of the lake bed cave. Let's go.
[22481.14s -> 22504.68s]  North pole. This way. Like in here. In here. This is the big cave. This is so dark.
[22505.88s -> 22512.52s]  I think I missed my opportunity. The sand is all here. Did I miss the opportunity?
[22513.16s -> 22533.56s]  I might have. I have an opportunity here. The lake bed cave. It's down there. The sand's covering
[22533.56s -> 22551.11s]  it. Might as well fly into the sun. Unless it's like here or something. No, it's definitely on
[22551.11s -> 22560.71s]  the bottom. Lake bed. I think I missed the opportunity. Definitely missed the opportunity
[22560.71s -> 22587.51s]  to do this. Oh well. Start shoveling. I guess I could go back to the quantum moon. It's right there.
[22588.47s -> 22603.53s]  All right. Percentage check. Percentage check of me getting to the end. Completing the game.
[22603.53s -> 22632.33s]  Percentage check. 20 percent. Not joking. 40 percent for sure. Like 45 percent. 40 percent. 35, 30, 40.
[22634.49s -> 22641.03s]  No, put the suit back on. All right. Where do I want to go?
[22641.03s -> 22665.14s]  Still shit to do. Let me look at the map. Ash twin project. I still have to do these cave things.
[22666.97s -> 22676.57s]  Lake bed cave. Dry lake bed. All right. Let's go. I'm doing that immediately today. I'm just
[22676.57s -> 22700.58s]  going to instantly kill myself here. Trying to ghost ride it. All right. We got to be quick.
[22700.58s -> 22716.22s]  We got to go right to the bottom of that lake bed cave. How I feel about the game so far. I'm
[22716.22s -> 22722.39s]  intrigued because I kind of want to know. I kind of want to unravel its mysteries.
[22725.27s -> 22732.20s]  I just want to know. All right. There's an air of mystery here that I would like to know
[22732.20s -> 22741.35s]  how it comes together. All right. It's a little puzzle that you put together in your brain.
[22741.51s -> 22772.60s]  Sounds cool. Wow. There's time. I'm going to go up.
[22774.28s -> 22785.51s]  I'm going right for the golf ball. I always just go too fast because I'm just
[22786.07s -> 22791.19s]  I go so fast. Go like seven trillion miles per hour and then I can't stop.
[22792.46s -> 22794.46s]  It's like a it's like if you were on a train trip.
[22794.46s -> 22804.25s]  Okay.
[22845.69s -> 22866.52s]  Jerma has to eat a ghost pepper. Get me up. Let's go. Just don't blow your speed out and go crazy.
[22867.24s -> 22909.94s]  Is it going behind or in front? All right. What the hell was I doing? Oh, the lake bed.
[22909.94s -> 22921.67s]  North pole lake bed. Yep. Don't you dare block me here. I don't even think about it.
[22922.39s -> 22966.46s]  It's going to block me. It's coming for me to block me. Asshole. Okay. Hurry up. Let's go into
[22966.46s -> 22991.18s]  the cave. North pole. Why did I not land on the south pole? Why? Here it is. Am I going fast?
[22991.18s -> 23005.02s]  Yeah. Kind of. Okay. All right. Here we are. Where is it? Cave? Looks like a cave. What the
[23005.02s -> 23042.58s]  fuck is this? Stress beacon. Beacon. Hide and seek. No. Where the hell am I? Um, cave shard is
[23042.58s -> 23061.78s]  over there. Stop showing me the moon. I don't care about the fucking moon. Is it right above me?
[23062.42s -> 23090.82s]  It's above me. Oh, I'm getting squished. Damn it. Was I in the right spot though? I
[23091.54s -> 23097.46s]  looked like it was above me. That was the worst sound. Yeah, that was a horrible noise.
[23103.64s -> 23132.26s]  I don't know how to do that. Hurry up and go faster. I mean, I can't go that fast.
[23140.89s -> 23156.49s]  I gotta go slow. I'm trying. Hurry up and go faster. Dude, I can't. I'm supposed to fly into the cave?
[23157.77s -> 23177.45s]  All right. Where is it? Where's the, where's the, where's the north pole? I don't know where,
[23177.45s -> 23181.37s]  I don't know what, what, what the north pole is. What's a landmark I can look for?
[23182.33s -> 23201.75s]  What the fuck? Just get the fuck out. North? Which way is north? I'm running the equation.
[23201.75s -> 23230.60s]  All right. Let's try this again. Get in here. All the way down. Where am I? Okay. Where am I?
[23232.50s -> 23263.30s]  Am I in? Keep going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. That above me. It's fucking above me.
[23263.86s -> 23292.70s]  It's above me. Where the fuck did I just end up? Wait, what? Where is this? Why is it? Dude, that
[23299.46s -> 23304.41s]  All right. I, it's so disorienting down there too. Did I miss the opportunity again?
[23305.45s -> 23317.18s]  Stop looking for the signal. This is the cave right here, but like, I understand. I'm just
[23317.18s -> 23325.16s]  looking for the signal. In case you're curious, 11,000 meters that way, there's a quantum moon.
[23327.75s -> 23340.07s]  It's anybody wanted to know. Oh, and 60,000 meters behind you. There's a, there's a beacon
[23340.07s -> 23358.57s]  somewhere over there. Just in case you wanted to know for your current objective. Signal doesn't
[23358.57s -> 23373.46s]  do anything. Just go. I feel like that shit happens so fast. You want to smash this game
[23373.46s -> 23383.93s]  from making, you want to smash this game from making that noise. So forget about the signal.
[23383.93s -> 23389.66s]  Just run in and just keep going in. But I keep hitting the wall. There's the, it's like blocked
[23389.66s -> 23402.22s]  two or three of those passages blocked. Think of the cave as a maze. You have to finish in
[23402.22s -> 23433.45s]  under two minutes. That doesn't sound like something I want to do. Where's that northern
[23433.45s -> 23441.59s]  section? Slow down. Let's go here. Is that north or is that south? I don't even know.
[23442.39s -> 23469.59s]  Do I have a compass anywhere? Get in here. Right there. Fuck it. Dude, I'm just flying the shit
[23469.59s -> 23483.99s]  in here. I don't give a shit. Let's go. I don't give a fuck. It explodes. Don't get crushed by
[23483.99s -> 23492.02s]  it. Don't get crushed by it. Don't get crushed by it. I'm in. I'm in. Am I in? I'm in. All right.
[23492.02s -> 23530.47s]  Left and then left. Left. Left. Right. Wrong. Right. Left. Right. Dead end. What the fuck?
[23530.47s -> 23537.78s]  I don't know. I get this tiny circle in the middle of my screen. I don't even know what
[23537.78s -> 23545.29s]  direction I'm facing right now. I don't know what direction I'm in. I think I'm outside again.
[23546.70s -> 23574.47s]  Where am I? Where's my flashlight pointing? What? Am I in? Did I make it? Am I in? Use the scout?
[23583.61s -> 23617.66s]  Where am I supposed to go from here? Crunch incoming. I can't fly right now. I just have
[23617.66s -> 23632.58s]  no idea where this even wants me to go. Am I supposed to go up this cave? Here? I mean,
[23632.58s -> 23657.75s]  that's what I'm trying to do. Fuck. Am I in? Am I? I'm trying to stand on this.
[23667.80s -> 23681.69s]  Can I not stand on this? How did I not land on that? God damn it, man. Give me a break.
[23690.22s -> 23712.98s]  It's pushing me off. What the fuck is going on right now? Did I do it? If I go out this,
[23712.98s -> 23747.94s]  am I going to die? What? I can't go this way. Fuck this maze bullshit. Quantum fucking maze.
[23749.05s -> 23784.95s]  What? I'm losing my goddamn mind. Are these teleporting behind me? I don't even know what
[23784.95s -> 23796.68s]  direction I'm in. Wrong, wrong, but is it wrong? What the fuck are you doing to me? This is
[23796.68s -> 23801.40s]  ridiculous. I don't know what to do. Am I going crazy or is this happening to you?
[23804.04s -> 23809.80s]  I'm going crazy. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Okay, don't. Wait, don't. All right. All
[23809.80s -> 23822.97s]  right. That's not cool. What do I do? Turn. Motherfucker. I figured it out. Now what do I do?
[23841.21s -> 23862.46s]  Turn. Get out. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I'm almost out of oxygen.
[23865.16s -> 23875.75s]  I did it. If you come here to look for Coleus, this is where we vanished. He's been missing
[23875.75s -> 23882.86s]  for two days. What happened before Coleus disappeared? We were examining the different
[23882.86s -> 23888.06s]  rocks. I recall Coleus standing on the largest one, the wandering rock. I was taking notes and
[23888.06s -> 23897.13s]  then my lantern died. I lit it again. Coleus and the rock were both gone. Your strange wandering
[23897.13s -> 23902.92s]  rock friend is here, though Coleus isn't. Coleus and I observed this unusual looking rock shard
[23904.39s -> 23908.79s]  in at least two other caverns. I'm unsure if this is relevant. I thought I was going crazy.
[23909.27s -> 23916.42s]  I looked over at the chat and people were like, dude, what are you nuts? You fucking just walk
[23916.42s -> 23920.50s]  straight. What's wrong with you? I'm like, what's wrong with me? I'm like, what's wrong with me?
[23920.50s -> 23925.18s]  Something's wrong with me. What's wrong with me? I thought I was going insane.
[23926.06s -> 23941.48s]  It was like, dude, are you fucking serious? Get a grip, man. What's wrong with you? What are you
[23941.48s -> 23992.49s]  doing? All right. Well, there's the cave shard. Do I move this thing? How do I? I can go. Hold on.
[23992.49s -> 24027.61s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Let me do it. How curious this rock took me with it to a new
[24027.61s -> 24034.17s]  location. I wonder why this happened. Curious, but also alarming. This new cave appears to lack an
[24034.17s -> 24038.33s]  entrance or exit. Also, the rock that brought me here disappeared while I wasn't watching.
[24038.89s -> 24046.14s]  The wandering rock has returned. Never before have I seen been so delighted to see a sedimentary
[24046.14s -> 24053.90s]  specimen. I wonder if I myself become quantum briefly when the rock carried me here. This seems
[24053.90s -> 24061.16s]  the clearest explanation. If the rock can bring me here, it can also carry me out. I can travel
[24061.16s -> 24065.40s]  on this rock as long as I'm not observing my surroundings, meaning I must be in complete
[24065.40s -> 24074.02s]  darkness. I'm going to bring my mentor here to see this. Malory is here now too. We theorize when a
[24074.02s -> 24078.10s]  conscious being is in contact with a quantum object and ceases to act as an observer,
[24078.74s -> 24083.59s]  the being can become entangled with that quantum object and they'd move together.
[24086.60s -> 24098.66s]  Friends, Coleus has discovered a new quantum rule. Wasn't there another one of these down
[24098.66s -> 24115.08s]  here somewhere? There was another one, wasn't there? It's the same one. No, I mean like in a
[24115.08s -> 24137.94s]  different cave. This is the same one. Oh, it's just the same. I think I did everything I can.
[24138.58s -> 24165.54s]  Turn the lights on. Wait, hold on. Can I go more? Can I do more? Wait, it does go to another place,
[24165.54s -> 24192.74s]  doesn't it? Okay, this is the one I was just in. Oh, shit. Friends, if you find any sign of Coleus,
[24192.74s -> 24202.18s]  I implore you to tell me. Ah, this is where that is. Yeah, we've read this already. So,
[24202.18s -> 24205.54s]  you're telling me I could have just stood on this rock and turned the lights off and I would have
[24205.54s -> 24212.10s]  been able to just not have to do the streamer, you're going crazy, like what's wrong with you
[24212.10s -> 24226.47s]  segment? I felt so sad too. I was getting so sad and almost upset and angry with myself because
[24226.47s -> 24229.99s]  I keep seeing like people saying, stop pretending and shit. I'm just like, am I?
[24230.71s -> 24238.97s]  I don't think I am. Am I pretending to not know where to go? I was just like, what happened? How
[24238.97s -> 24252.39s]  do I not know this? Well, all right, I got that mystery solved. So then hold on. If I go on the
[24252.39s -> 24291.22s]  moon, that means that if I turn all the lights off, I can go to the secret moon spot. Why do
[24291.22s -> 24298.79s]  you let chat bully you so much? I don't. I usually, hey, half the time I'm like, hey, shut up. What
[24298.79s -> 24302.52s]  you guys think you are? But I thought I was actually something wrong with me there.
[24320.92s -> 24326.52s]  Don't let this affect you like that. I mean, I was in the, you're losing your mind part of the game.
[24328.04s -> 24333.64s]  No, it's all good. Don't worry. I know you guys aren't really trying to make me think
[24333.64s -> 24341.85s]  them. Well, maybe some of you are. All right, put it in the computer. Cave.
[24342.98s -> 24354.81s]  On quantum moon locator. Sixth location. Quantum moon disappears sometimes.
[24354.81s -> 24386.33s]  Well, what do you know? Quantum moon time. Quantum moon right there. Where is it?
[24388.46s -> 24417.64s]  Where's quantum moon? So you're telling me that all I have to do is close my eyes.
[24418.60s -> 24429.50s]  And well, we'd like to not go that fast. So I'm going to close my eyes on this moon.
[24429.50s -> 24447.74s]  I don't understand. I don't understand what happened.
[24462.66s -> 24466.10s]  All right, I'm going to make a comparison here to something.
[24466.10s -> 24470.65s]  And a lot of you guys are going to know what I'm talking about. I remember when I played Darkwood
[24470.65s -> 24476.17s]  and I stepped in a trap every like four and a half minutes. And it got to a point where everybody was
[24476.17s -> 24480.09s]  certain that I was doing it on purpose. They actually believed it. I was like, dude, there's
[24480.09s -> 24483.45s]  no way you're doing that. You have to be doing that. You've stepped in like 30 traps.
[24484.41s -> 24490.47s]  The sun is just a trap from Darkwood. It's just, it just keeps happening. There's nothing I can do
[24490.47s -> 24503.34s]  about it. OK, quantum moon. I want to try this theory out. Where is the damn thing?
[24511.22s -> 24533.94s]  Percentage check. And we're around 40 to 50, 50, 40 to 50 ish, 50 to 60, 40, 50. Really? All right.
[24533.94s -> 24549.86s]  Is this what we're doing tomorrow? I want to make sure there's enough to do a full stream on this
[24549.86s -> 24561.32s]  tomorrow. It's been six and a half, seven hours. All right. So is there, those of you that are
[24561.32s -> 24575.32s]  experts, is there about six to six to eight hours left in the game? Yes, probably. Probably more
[24575.32s -> 24589.29s]  than that. For you, yes. Depends on how good you are. At least six to seven, six to nine. OK. All
[24589.29s -> 24619.03s]  right. Let's find that moon. The moon. Yeah, because I want to have a good six hour stream,
[24619.03s -> 24622.23s]  six to ten hour stream tomorrow. Like there's a six to eight hour stream tonight.
[24623.03s -> 24653.22s]  Depends on how fast you can solve things. OK, I got a photo. I need a note. All right, there we go.
[24653.94s -> 24676.25s]  We're on the, OK, now we're on the moon. Unbuckle. Let's get out. Now what and what do we do here?
[24676.25s -> 24685.48s]  Somebody's dead. Who is this? They have a mask on. They're wearing one of these masks. They're
[24685.48s -> 24693.42s]  wearing a memory. They're wearing a USB mask. Whatever that is. OK, so somebody's wearing a
[24693.42s -> 24720.92s]  USB mask here. OK, they're on the ground now. You landed on this guy. Let's not look. OK,
[24720.92s -> 24731.88s]  let's see what happens. He's just dead. OK, I don't want to waste any time. OK, any fluctuation?
[24732.92s -> 24745.59s]  Just on the moon. All right, so what am I looking for here? If I close my eyes, it will disappear.
[24746.23s -> 24807.69s]  Right? Wait, this moved. It's dark in here. It's dark in here. Now what? New planet? This is ice
[24807.69s -> 24833.85s]  planet. Flood. Wait, no, this is the this is that is this I think I've ever been here.
[24834.41s -> 24852.89s]  Isn't this this like the tentacle planet, right? I want to go to that one. I've not been to that
[24852.89s -> 24916.31s]  one yet. I've seen all these elements, but not this one. OK, we're here. OK, well, bye.
[24917.27s -> 24927.51s]  Quantum imaging, quantum entanglement, rule of the sixth location.
[24976.82s -> 25006.41s]  Shit, what is this one? Quantum now.
[25008.89s -> 25027.78s]  I don't know the third rule. I don't know the third rule. What's over here? Anything?
[25028.74s -> 25080.52s]  The sixth location rule. Where is that? Where's my where's my where's my rules?
[25081.32s -> 25094.73s]  I want to wear my rules. If you recall the rule of quantum imaging, quantum entanglement.
[25095.85s -> 25101.22s]  Let's go over the rules. Quantum imaging is as long as I have a picture of something,
[25101.22s -> 25106.58s]  as long as I can see something, it exists. But if I don't see something, it could exist somewhere
[25106.58s -> 25120.87s]  else. Quantum entanglement is I can ride on top of the rock, right? That's the you're entangled
[25120.87s -> 25134.70s]  in the quantum and you can move around the rule of the sixth location. This is the sixth location.
[25134.70s -> 25178.70s]  What's the rule of the sixth location? Turn lights up. Hold on. I need to be able to stand in it.
[25194.79s -> 25200.94s]  Image. If I take what if I take a picture of just the door? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[25200.94s -> 25204.22s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I have an idea. All right. I have an idea. I'm going to take a
[25204.22s -> 25213.75s]  picture of the door with this. It's empty. And then I'm going to hold on. Oh, watch this.
[25213.75s -> 25241.72s]  Close the door. Close the door. Now turn the light off. Come on. I thought that was going to be it.
[25241.72s -> 25272.98s]  And then I don't even know what this location is. Let me let me I can't move now. That's not what
[25272.98s -> 25279.06s]  I want to be. I want to be with water filling this place. Why is this place filling up with water?
[25284.22s -> 25303.16s]  Quantum tree. Quantum tree. Okay. Quantum tree. Quantum tree. Quantum tree. Watch this. Ready?
[25303.16s -> 25315.69s]  Okay. Quantum tree. Wait, where's the one that just back here? Where is this? Hold on. Is this
[25315.69s -> 25331.00s]  even? This is not even a plant. Wait a minute. This is not the this is different location.
[25331.80s -> 25352.31s]  This is not that planet. This is bullshit. This is we're not even on that planet.
[25353.51s -> 25367.26s]  All right. Hold on. Let me get out. Close this. I'm going to check out. I'm going to
[25367.26s -> 25387.45s]  explore the other fake planet. I think I just broke it. All right. Let's see what happens
[25387.45s -> 25402.06s]  when I go back over here. Let's check this out. Because these are fake planets. This is not real.
[25402.06s -> 25411.35s]  Look at this. It's not even real. It's probably some clue around here somewhere.
[25412.39s -> 25435.88s]  If this is them, this is this is the moon. But why does it look like this?
[25436.44s -> 25466.97s]  I'm missing something and I don't know what it is. What is it though? It's rule the sixth location.
[25468.57s -> 25499.56s]  That's this thing. Can I take a picture of the moon? Because I mean it's just it's just a
[25499.56s -> 25543.88s]  hold on. All right. Where is it? Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. Where am I? I'm out of
[25543.96s -> 25584.23s]  fucking fuel. Get back there very fast. But if it's if it's the rule, the sixth location is just the
[25584.23s -> 25609.16s]  moon and I need to keep the moon in place. The sixth location is the moon. Rule of the moon.
[25609.16s -> 25614.84s]  Rule of the sixth location. What is this? What is I don't even know if the sixth location is.
[25615.56s -> 25620.70s]  Wait, let me look. I don't have any. All right. I didn't do this shit.
[25621.83s -> 25625.99s]  Giants deep to the lower boat and we're in but the statue. Didn't I do this?
[25626.79s -> 25652.10s]  All right, we're going. No. Ocean depths.
[25655.66s -> 25661.24s]  It's a path beneath the surface that leads to the observatory. The trailhead starts at Brittle
[25661.24s -> 25689.24s]  Hollows equator. All right, let's do that. Hollows equator. Let's give it a look. Somebody said,
[25689.32s -> 25699.67s]  this is boring. Go back to flying into the sun. I've been to Dark Bramble. Yes, I have.
[25700.31s -> 25716.41s]  I did a lot of the stuff there. Brittle Hollow. The equator. It's pretty much right here. I haven't
[25716.41s -> 25720.33s]  really done much in this planet anyways, so I might as well just crash into it and fucking
[25720.33s -> 25747.98s]  everybody will laugh. Equator for this place to go in. Here's the equator. Is this thing?
[25748.86s -> 25766.14s]  The trees detected. All right, we have some new info. Well, shit. Okay. The trees are moving. The
[25766.14s -> 25772.46s]  trees in this grove wander about freely. This is not normal. Even for this alien planet. I never
[25772.46s -> 25778.68s]  see them move. Is this even possible? Anyone else witnesses this disturbing behavior? I implore you
[25778.68s -> 25785.40s]  record your observations here. These trees are aberrant. My brain must be. Flume is right. The
[25785.40s -> 25791.53s]  trees do move. I confess I didn't notice until I read these notes. Alarmingly, it isn't only
[25791.53s -> 25798.15s]  the trees. There is other matter in this area, such as that unusual shard of rock moving in the
[25798.15s -> 25806.01s]  same eerie way. That rock is unusual for another reason too. It possesses color and texture I've
[25806.01s -> 25811.30s]  never seen elsewhere on this planet. This rock shard's presence is significant. We should study
[25811.30s -> 25827.70s]  it. It would be what is causing other nearby objects to move. Poor shard. I already got that.
[25827.70s -> 25839.54s]  Wait, does it disappear? If I don't look at it. It does. Where does it go? Can I stand on it?
[25840.58s -> 25852.26s]  Determine this optical shard of rock as the reason objects grow and behave in a quantum manner.
[25852.98s -> 25857.78s]  The only other object we've observed displaying this quantum behavior is the wandering moon.
[25857.78s -> 25864.81s]  Yeah, imagine the moon. I think I've already read this. I know from earlier Clitz mentions this
[25864.81s -> 25868.97s]  strange type of rock isn't found elsewhere on Brittle Hollow. What if it isn't originally from
[25868.97s -> 25875.64s]  this planet? From the wandering moon. Perhaps it's even a small piece of the moon itself.
[25875.64s -> 25884.39s]  All right, so it's a moon. All right. All right, turn the lights off.
[25885.35s -> 25902.87s]  Close my eyes. I read this like four hours ago. Yeah, I did. Why is it so dark? Beneath your feet
[25902.87s -> 25909.00s]  lies the tower of quantum knowledge. If you're preparing to make your first pilgrimage to the
[25909.00s -> 25913.24s]  quantum moon, descend the steps to the entrance below. The knowledge held within will help you
[25913.24s -> 25933.98s]  on your journey. All right. There's the black hole. I remember falling in that earlier.
[25934.78s -> 25949.80s]  There. Quantum. What's this quantum? Entrance to the tower of quantum knowledge. All right,
[25949.80s -> 25955.48s]  I'm going in there, but what's over there? Southern Observatory. Wait, I need to do this too.
[25956.68s -> 26012.42s]  Arcane Sanctuary. All right, where? Turn it on. Oh, must I missed it, I think.
[26014.90s -> 26023.59s]  I thought it was just going to go. Wait, hold on. I might be able to get caught in it.
[26024.23s -> 26055.10s]  I found Rybeck. Rybeck. Oh, you launched. That's great. Great job to you. Oh, I guess that means
[26055.10s -> 26058.30s]  I've been out here a while, huh? Well, this is Riddle Hollow, but you probably knew that.
[26059.26s -> 26065.90s]  A lot of history here. It's great. What are you doing here? I'm here to see the Hanging City.
[26068.09s -> 26076.78s]  Um, should we be concerned about what just fell? Oh, okay. It's always been my dream to see it with
[26076.78s -> 26081.26s]  my own four eyes ever since I saw Hatching. Did you miss it? Because I think it was behind you.
[26082.22s -> 26087.10s]  The alien race lived in the solar system long before our species even existed.
[26087.90s -> 26093.66s]  How could I not want to see what their civilization was like? Only you've probably
[26093.66s -> 26097.10s]  heard the other say it, right? I'm afraid of space. Seriously, I'm more surprised than anybody that
[26097.10s -> 26103.72s]  I'm out here. Want to know how I even got this far? I fell. Me too, Rybeck, me too.
[26104.60s -> 26109.32s]  Tripped over a gravity crystal. It's dumb luck I landed somewhere my little scout says is halfway
[26109.32s -> 26115.59s]  stable instead of being sucked into what's below. I'm engaging the stability of the ground around
[26115.59s -> 26121.08s]  me using my little scout. It needs to be the place with the best surface integrity. I'm just
[26121.08s -> 26125.86s]  going to stay here until I'm ready to move on. That's enough about me and my problems. You didn't
[26125.86s -> 26131.06s]  come all this way to listen to me blather, did you? Yeah, that'd be yeah. Hey, I learned something.
[26131.78s -> 26136.63s]  I saw the Sunless City on the Ember Twin. You mean there's another No-My City inside the Ember
[26136.71s -> 26141.27s]  Twin? That's incredible. The whole city and I had no idea it existed. How'd they keep the sand out?
[26141.83s -> 26146.97s]  For me, I'd be nervous about getting buried in the caves by that awful river of sand.
[26148.98s -> 26153.38s]  Gosh, the No-Mys sure were ingenious, building an entire settlement underground. The Sunless City,
[26153.38s -> 26160.71s]  wow. That means there were two groups of No-My, one that lived on Ember Twin and one that lived
[26160.71s -> 26164.15s]  here on Brittle Hollow, but they must have traveled around the solar system since No-My
[26164.15s -> 26173.88s]  writing can be found on other planets too. Where should I look here? Where shouldn't you explore?
[26174.12s -> 26178.36s]  Not the black hole. That's very no, which is unfortunate because the most exciting
[26178.36s -> 26183.56s]  stuff is behind below the crust, including the Hanging City. That's just to the north.
[26183.56s -> 26188.87s]  You can kind of see it from here. There's also this big dome on the south pole called the
[26188.87s -> 26194.39s]  Southern Observatory. You can't get inside from the surface. Trust me, I tried, but it's like the
[26194.39s -> 26198.15s]  rest of the No-My structures here. There's probably a path to beneath the crust somewhere. I'd love
[26198.15s -> 26211.90s]  to be exploring. I'd love to hear it. Okay, we got some new info. I'm just going for what that is.
[26229.85s -> 26275.00s]  Let me back in. Let me back in. Let me back in. Let me back in. Let me back in. Can I reach that
[26275.00s -> 26301.58s]  from here? I'm just gonna go to the interloper. I'm actually going pretty fast. Okay, all right,
[26301.58s -> 26326.33s]  all right, all right. I'm in perfect trajectory. Load up. 27, 28, 26, 2000, 17. All right, keep
[26326.33s -> 26358.31s]  going. 15, 13, 12, 11, 10. Okay, slow, slow, slow. 29. All right, where am I, sir? The interloper.
[26358.31s -> 26381.90s]  Is this an asteroid? Land. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. All right, let me.
[26382.70s -> 26416.10s]  We're not going into the sun, are we? No. Are we? No. Distress beacon? There's a distress beacon
[26416.10s -> 26425.43s]  up there. All right. What's going on? Hide and seek. No, there's no frequency over here. All
[26425.43s -> 26435.14s]  right. What am I looking for? Something up here? Something to look at? Is there anything up here?
[26435.78s -> 26468.42s]  What about on the top? No. Up here. The giant ice. Wait a minute. What's that? Something. Something.
[26469.14s -> 26491.29s]  It's me. Something right here. Something. Come on. I just need to see before I die. Before I die.
[26491.29s -> 26502.98s]  Before I die. Come on. I need to see before I die. I need to see before I die. Please. I need to
[26502.98s -> 26519.72s]  see before I die. There's nothing to see. Turn around. I mean, I'm dead. What did I miss? I was
[26519.72s -> 26532.74s]  too focused on my breath meter going to zero. I went too fast. Golden retriever brain? Golden
[26532.74s -> 26536.42s]  retrievers are like the smartest animal though. Dude, what the fuck? Do you think I care about
[26536.42s -> 26550.18s]  you saying that? That's one of the smartest animals on earth. I think I'm gonna call it here.
[26553.50s -> 26557.18s]  I'm gonna call it here. I'm gonna call it here. I want and because I'm getting addicted to the game
[26557.18s -> 26569.72s]  and I want enough for tomorrow as well. Power of quantum knowledge. Pipex camp. Hanging city.
[26570.36s -> 26579.99s]  Go back to the comet first. All right. I'll go back. I'm gonna just fly the ship to the comet
[26580.87s -> 26595.88s]  and see if I can find what you're talking about. Interloper. There it is. Far away.
[26596.44s -> 26610.97s]  So I'm gonna assume there's probably at least another good six to eight hours left of the game.
[26612.09s -> 26621.40s]  Have I peed one time? No. I have not gotten up for a single break. No, you're right. Maybe a
[26621.40s -> 26628.36s]  little bit more than that. That's all right. I plan on trying to finish this game tomorrow.
[26629.16s -> 26647.48s]  That's the plan. You could beat it tonight. Well, we'll see. We'll see where it takes us.
[26648.20s -> 26650.92s]  There's more than enough game for another day, I can tell you that. All right. Well, that's
[26651.88s -> 26658.90s]  gonna finish tomorrow. And then after that, should be able to play Tony Hawk.
[26659.70s -> 26667.54s]  For some reason, the Xbox 360 hard drive is not in. I'm going way too fast, boys and girls. And
[26667.54s -> 26673.22s]  this is what happens when I'm not paying attention. I'm just talking. I am okay. I think
[26676.58s -> 26694.22s]  this damaged the headlights a little. Who cares? Let's see if I can find this. What
[26694.22s -> 26709.24s]  you guys are talking about? Okay. So there's a there was apparently a ship that you said
[26709.24s -> 26720.52s]  there was a there was a missed a ship. This is just a suicide mission. Yes.
[26720.52s -> 26758.10s]  You're here somewhere? Because I remember this is this part. What's that light? We're here?
[26758.82s -> 26785.40s]  Uh, I don't see anything. Like that way. Oh, we're going towards the sun. My hey,
[26785.40s -> 26823.18s]  have to be careful. Now I can reach this. Where the hell is that ship? I don't think I think I'm
[26823.18s -> 26846.12s]  better reach. I literally can't feel anywhere. I just got at the sub that I was trying to find
[26846.12s -> 26851.00s]  this thing. And now the sun was coming up and I thought I was going to fucking fall into the sun.
[26851.80s -> 26863.24s]  I don't I don't know if this is I don't have to do this on the side with the spikes.
[26863.24s -> 26870.07s]  Like I was on that side. Let me try this one more time. One more time.
[26870.87s -> 26886.34s]  It's done. Wasn't I in the spikes when I fell off?
[26887.22s -> 26902.57s]  Didn't look. Yeah. But I mean, the things made it to ice and you just skim. I can't like walk on
[26902.57s -> 26908.66s]  the surface and just skimming across the surface. I can't walk on it. There's no gravity on this
[26908.66s -> 26940.18s]  thing. All right. Last try. And then that's the end of the stream. It's a million years away.
[26940.90s -> 26964.44s]  He's addicted. I think a little I think I'm more addicted to one. Just want to know what the hell
[26964.44s -> 26975.02s]  happens. The story has me intrigued. I want to know what's going on. Why am I teleporting back
[26975.02s -> 26985.32s]  through time? What do these people do? What did this other civilization do? And why are we here
[26985.32s -> 27002.54s]  doing this? See you later. I'm going to bed. I'm sitting there talking to you guys. I'm sitting
[27002.54s -> 27006.86s]  here looking at chat with holding the button. And I'm just like, yeah, you know, I'm addicted. And
[27006.86s -> 27019.48s]  I like to talk about the story and seeing what you guys have to say. I'm still going negative
[27019.48s -> 27030.10s]  miles per hour. I'm like 10. I'm much further. Let's try this again. This thing's so tiny. It's
[27030.10s -> 27039.40s]  so hard to find just such a small little fucking asteroid. Like this is why space games are hard
[27039.40s -> 27047.08s]  for my brain. I feel like I'm not even moving right now. In my fucking cube brain. I'm standing
[27047.08s -> 27094.41s]  still. Here comes the trash planet. Try to get on the spikes. What am I looking for here?
[27095.61s -> 27101.75s]  I see something underneath. No, it's not. That's not anything. That's nothing.
[27103.64s -> 27121.86s]  Right in the middle. Right there. Right there. Right there. All right. What's that? Found it.
[27122.42s -> 27144.33s]  It's a suicide mission. I don't care. This is troublesome. It seems the comet wishes to
[27144.33s -> 27149.61s]  submerge our shuttle in ice. If we stay on the surface too long, the shuttle may freeze entirely.
[27150.65s -> 27157.11s]  Even if it did, wouldn't someone call it back home to the gravity cannon on Ember Twin? Yes,
[27157.11s -> 27160.87s]  but the exploration of the comet would be more difficult if we were without the shuttle.
[27160.87s -> 27165.50s]  Until someone recalled it. Perhaps we shouldn't have landed on the dark side of the comet.
[27165.50s -> 27171.26s]  I suppose one of us remained on the shuttle. In the shuttle to keep it warm and continue monitoring
[27171.26s -> 27176.30s]  the surface. Could it be wise, I think? Larry, if you don't mind waiting here with it, Oak and I
[27177.26s -> 27201.40s]  can continue to investigate the surface. I didn't jump. I didn't jump. I did not jump.
[27201.40s -> 27208.46s]  I didn't press any buttons. I didn't do anything. It sucked us out. Did you not see
[27209.02s -> 27234.52s]  my friend the ship getting sucked out? I didn't do anything. Get in. Hey, we did it. Let's download
[27234.52s -> 27254.50s]  that data. All right. That's it. I'll see you guys tomorrow for more Out of Wild. We'll try
[27254.50s -> 27277.29s]  to finish the game. Final Sun joke? No, no, no, no, no. Something here. I want to see.
[27278.17s -> 27290.15s]  Hey, Jerma, that was a good try. Hey, thanks. All right. What else is on here?
[27291.35s -> 27323.21s]  Okay. What else is on here? Something else? Wait, the ice can melt? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[27323.21s -> 27342.84s]  wait. Holy shit. The ice is... Okay. Hold on. Where's the tail? All right. Where was that?
[27342.84s -> 27356.92s]  There it is. All right. This is gonna melt. All right. This is gonna melt. Quantum melt?
[27357.56s -> 27382.22s]  That sounds like a Subway sandwich. The quantum melt at Subway.
[27383.90s -> 27389.32s]  All right. I'm so far away from the sun. Am I even gonna do it? Am I even gonna come back there?
[27390.12s -> 27399.10s]  Holy shit. I want one of those. A quantum melt? Seriously? That would be turkey, ham,
[27399.90s -> 27406.46s]  like six different kinds of cheeses. It'd be like Swiss, cheddar, provolone, gruyere, brie.
[27407.10s -> 27450.33s]  It'd be every cheese. I'm gonna sit here. I'm not gonna move, right? Secret menu. Check the orbit?
[27450.33s -> 27462.98s]  Yeah. Wait, is this gonna take too long? Is this song gonna explode? Just read bits? Yeah,
[27462.98s -> 27481.03s]  that's not a bad idea. I'll just read bits. That sounds good. Still going? Still moving, right?
[27481.99s -> 27492.09s]  Or is it paused? Is it paused when it's all tabbed? I think it's paused when it's all tabbed.
[27493.05s -> 27500.30s]  Well, I can do it because I can just load up the screen over here. All right.
[27501.02s -> 27504.41s]  Let's go back. Thanks. That's the end of the stream. See you guys tomorrow.
[27505.05s -> 27514.58s]  Let's go back a little bit and read some bits. Super Bruce gave five community subs. Thank you,
[27514.58s -> 27521.83s]  Super Bruce. Appreciate it. That was earlier, about six or seven hours ago here. Seven or eight
[27521.83s -> 27531.11s]  hours, actually, almost. Sweet Croc, thanks for the 1500 bits. $15. Say, hey, Jeremy, I've been
[27531.11s -> 27535.85s]  watching for a while. Finally getting to donate. Out of Wilds was my game of the year last year
[27535.85s -> 27539.37s]  and maybe my favorite game of the last five years. Hope you enjoy it. Can't wait to watch.
[27540.09s -> 27546.86s]  It is very enjoyable. I especially like the story. I want to know why this is happening.
[27547.58s -> 27553.19s]  Somebody's just breathing in your room. Yes. Did nobody say that? I did.
[27553.19s -> 27561.02s]  But thank you. Appreciate the 1500 bits and it's pretty good so far. We'll see how I feel about it
[27561.02s -> 27566.50s]  after another day. I feel like I'm probably going to like it though. It seems really good,
[27566.50s -> 27574.58s]  is what I've played so far. Hey, more jelly. Thanks for the 500 bits. Oh, you say it's declined,
[27574.58s -> 27579.59s]  huh? You said it was declined. All right, shit. Well, try my MasterCard, bro. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27579.59s -> 27594.44s]  I got money on my MasterCard. Sure. Thank you more jelly with the $5. Do not fuck with your card.
[27598.58s -> 27607.62s]  Thank you, Hikiko Morris Sunday. What just happened? We coming on? That's the wrong controller.
[27607.62s -> 27618.90s]  This Xbox fucking 360 controller. Hold on. No, we're good. We're actually getting close.
[27620.62s -> 27628.42s]  Thank you to Hikiko Morris Sunday for the 300 bits. They say, Hi, Jim. A couple weeks ago,
[27628.42s -> 27631.62s]  I had a dream that I sent a message in chat saying that I was having a birthday party,
[27631.62s -> 27635.70s]  but no one showed up. So you doxed me to encourage people to come over, but no one showed up.
[27636.66s -> 27649.96s]  Anyway, what's your favorite Destiny's Child song? Mine is Say My Name. That one too. I like that
[27649.96s -> 27658.97s]  one. That's good. Digitron Surfers, thanks for the 500 bits. In the upcoming YouTuber movie series,
[27658.97s -> 27662.57s]  are you going to be playing penis Jerma or are you going to just to play yourself? I love your
[27662.57s -> 27677.26s]  channel. I don't even know what that means. Bryant Ziggs, thanks for the, hold on. We're almost there.
[27677.26s -> 27684.15s]  All right, let's see what happens. Bryant Ziggs, thanks for 1500 bits. Jerma, I had a dream the
[27684.15s -> 27721.38s]  other night that you were doing a live show in my, another dream. Melt? That didn't do anything.
[27721.38s -> 27745.06s]  All right, goodbye. 20 jump jump. I didn't twice jump. I didn't. The sun comes up and fucking
[27745.94s -> 27752.18s]  pulls you up and I was holding left trigger. Run it back. I was holding left trigger and like
[27752.18s -> 27760.30s]  forward facing down. No, no, I got baited and that's fine. I can just quit, right?
[27760.86s -> 27779.80s]  Reset, loop and quit. Yeah, right? This is okay. We'll see what happens at the end of the game
[27779.80s -> 27792.25s]  tomorrow. Very cool. I will see you guys tomorrow for more Outer Wilds. Let's get the actual intro
[27792.25s -> 27801.94s]  or intro outro up. See what happens tomorrow. I'm going to be starting. Oh, what time am I going to
[27801.94s -> 27820.41s]  start tomorrow? Two again. And we're on like 145, 132. Something like that. But we had the 15 dollars
[27820.41s -> 27824.17s]  from Brian Ziggs. Thank you, Brian. Jerma, I had a dream the other night that you're doing a live
[27824.17s -> 27828.25s]  show in my city. I was so excited. I got all my friends and my girlfriend to go to it with me.
[27828.89s -> 27833.45s]  We managed to get front row seats and I prepared for what would be the greatest experience of my
[27833.45s -> 27839.45s]  whole life. What I got instead was you roasting the shit out of me for an hour. You absolutely
[27839.45s -> 27842.73s]  went in on me and all I could do was sit there and wonder what I did to deserve it.
[27843.69s -> 27848.31s]  I would never do that to somebody.
[27849.03s -> 27857.42s]  Oh, I'm sorry that I'm sorry the dream, Jerma, is a nuisance and a menace to society.
[27860.10s -> 27868.28s]  I don't know why. Evil, evil Jerma apparently sneaks into your dreams.
[27869.08s -> 27875.94s]  Hey, Drumager, thanks for the 500 bits. Since you don't seem to have a clue of your speed,
[27876.98s -> 27883.22s]  one mile equals roughly 1600 meters. Your speed is shown in meters per second. If you multiply it
[27883.38s -> 27889.46s]  by 3.6, it transfers to kilometers per hour. For reference, sound of speed in the air is around
[27889.46s -> 27893.30s]  343 meters per second. You're basically slamming into a planet twice that speed.
[27900.02s -> 27904.50s]  Well, it only took me eight hours straight of playing Astaroth's Wrath to find out that I
[27904.50s -> 27909.94s]  could regain health by hitting A. I didn't even need it. Beat the fucking game on hard.
[27910.66s -> 27920.41s]  It's all good. But thank you, though. And then we had PlankCat gave 1500 bits. Thank you for
[27920.41s -> 27926.68s]  the $15 PlankCat. I love your unbridled curiosity. It's perfect for this game.
[27926.68s -> 27931.83s]  This game is really cool for the one reason because you don't really have anything to do.
[27933.08s -> 27940.89s]  You do, but you don't. I like that aspect of just kind of doing anything you want without a real
[27940.89s -> 27945.85s]  goal. You just have this overarching thing that you're trying to figure out, but you don't have
[27945.85s -> 27955.88s]  like an A to B. You just go anywhere. I don't like the forced reset, but I understand it.
[27957.11s -> 27962.79s]  I think the forced reset, at least for me, is sort of tells you, all right, hey, you had some fun,
[27962.79s -> 27969.75s]  now do something else. It's almost like you have a time limit. It's good for me because I get so
[27969.75s -> 27975.94s]  fucked up and I'll get stuck on a planet for like three hours. So it helps me just be like, all
[27975.94s -> 27988.09s]  right, here comes the supernova. What are you doing tomorrow? It's good for ADHD. Yeah, because it
[27988.09s -> 27996.10s]  makes me have to do something else. I think it would be better if you had a kill me button.
[27999.14s -> 28006.18s]  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of dark and morbid, I guess, but there really probably should be like
[28006.18s -> 28010.58s]  I just rip the mask off the button if you like hold left trigger and right trigger for like five
[28010.58s -> 28017.94s]  seconds. So you can just like, instead of having to quit main menu restart, I feel like that's
[28018.74s -> 28028.47s]  takes you out of the experience. I'd rather be able just to rip the mask off and just delete it
[28028.47s -> 28041.35s]  and just go to the next day. It is, it is a lot of fun so far. I'm going to be sad when it's over.
[28041.91s -> 28046.31s]  Ocean dweller, thanks for 250. Dermagreatstream, as always, just wanted to say that the elevator
[28046.31s -> 28049.75s]  crush death summed up everything so perfectly about this playthrough. It was wonderful.
[28057.22s -> 28061.78s]  SoupGG, thanks for five dollars. Hey buddy, I guarantee it will take you at least four attempts
[28061.78s -> 28067.14s]  to beat the mission Big Apple Spot Challenge near the end of Tony Hawk's Underground this Friday.
[28067.86s -> 28072.18s]  If you can beat it in less than four, I will vomit up a Philly cheesesteak on my keyboard.
[28072.82s -> 28083.11s]  Aren't my words pal? I'll try. I'll try. Also keep in mind the Tony Hawk Underground stream
[28083.11s -> 28091.13s]  might happen on Saturday. Or sorry, yes Friday, right? Friday or Saturday because I have to wait
[28091.13s -> 28096.73s]  for that 360 hard drive to get in and it's in the mail so it might take another day. I don't know.
[28098.01s -> 28109.03s]  It will happen this week though before I leave. Hopefully it comes in for the next day or so.
[28111.38s -> 28115.94s]  But let's get the community subs and the regular subs and the credit subs,
[28118.98s -> 28132.09s]  all of them, going at the same time. Here come the credits. Here comes the janitor.
[28132.09s -> 28137.54s]  I'm gonna bump you. What is the German's favorite Beyonce song? Single Ladies.
[28138.18s -> 28143.34s]  Easy. It's the easiest question I've had all night. Thanks everybody for subbing.
[28148.57s -> 28156.41s]  Outer Wilds is a lot of fun. I look forward to completing it and seeing what happens.
[28158.20s -> 28169.91s]  Let's run the credits. I can't believe I, you know the thing I'm most annoyed about tonight?
[28171.38s -> 28174.50s]  The fact that I was like almost, I was more than a half a second
[28175.46s -> 28178.74s]  behind every event that happened on screen for like the first three and a half hours.
[28179.86s -> 28192.57s]  I'm so annoyed by that. It's all good though. Won't happen tomorrow. All right we do have a
[28192.57s -> 28197.45s]  little bit more to do. We have now similar bits to do. All of one zombie thanks to the 250. Hey
[28197.45s -> 28202.09s]  you think you'll ever play Prey? I mentioned it in the stalker stream. It's got a great art style
[28202.09s -> 28209.75s]  and soundtrack. I like space games though nothing will compare to Space Master. It's not really.
[28209.75s -> 28217.14s]  That is the best space game ever made. Oh Prey and Thief are the same game in my brain
[28218.60s -> 28230.42s]  and I don't know why. Is there a reason why that is? I don't, I'm just being honest. I don't know
[28230.42s -> 28236.34s]  why that is. They're not even the same at all. Yeah I don't, I don't know why that's happening.
[28237.30s -> 28251.75s]  Yeah put it on the list. The OG Thief games are good. Fuck the new one. Really okay.
[28252.87s -> 28261.46s]  I'll play Prey. Yeah let's go. Prey is basically a current gen remake of System Shock 2 which is
[28261.46s -> 28273.24s]  made by the same studio as Thief. Oh that's why I'm doing that. Put it on the list. Dark soul thanks
[28273.24s -> 28278.28s]  to the 250. Do you have any good awful local commercials to share? Here's one of my favorites.
[28279.16s -> 28284.25s]  Local commercials. Brothers Scrap Metal commercial.
[28306.97s -> 28308.33s]  Why would you have this much scrap metal?
[28315.99s -> 28319.27s]  Just because? Why would you have a ton of scrap metal in your house?
[28322.26s -> 28327.16s]  Uh I mean not really local commercials but anything with Kathy Mitchell is like
[28327.16s -> 28331.80s]  an automatic A plus commercial for me or infomercial. Hi Kathy Mitchell here with
[28331.80s -> 28340.84s]  the Super Cooker. She's, I love her so much. You guys like seriously don't know. I am a huge fan
[28340.84s -> 28347.67s]  of Kathy Mitchell. I'm a huge fan. If me and Kathy Mitchell were in the same room at a convention,
[28348.39s -> 28353.80s]  I would get nervous and I'd be taken aback. Oh it's Kathy Mitchell. She's not, she wouldn't,
[28353.80s -> 28363.21s]  she's not talking to me. I would want Kathy Mitchell's autograph and a photo and it would
[28363.21s -> 28368.89s]  be a great, it would be a great day. I'd feel so happy. Be like I got to meet Kathy Mitchell today.
[28368.89s -> 28378.18s]  No way. She's the dump cakes lady. Yeah she's been around for a long time. The new wave oven,
[28379.14s -> 28390.52s]  the pasta pro, dump cakes, dump meals. She does it all. I'm gonna do you all a favor.
[28392.76s -> 28398.98s]  Go to YouTube and just watch the new wave oven infomercial with Kathy Mitchell
[28400.09s -> 28411.22s]  and you will just absolutely adore everything that she does. She's just wonderful. Watch it now.
[28411.22s -> 28414.58s]  That's like a 30 minute infomercial. I'm not watching it right now. I'm getting out of here.
[28414.58s -> 28421.59s]  I'm going to get food and pee for the first time in eight hours. But we have one more bit donation
[28421.59s -> 28433.96s]  to do in this big one. $25.25. 100 bits from Lizard Amiibo. Thanks for the 25 bucks. I was
[28433.96s -> 28437.56s]  going to use this money to feed my 10 starving children but decided you could probably use it
[28437.56s -> 28452.81s]  more. Don't read this part out loud. Okay. Oh no. Okay. So uh no it's all good. Talking about the
[28452.81s -> 28466.49s]  doctor appointment I had. So basically how it goes is I probably just have a costochondritis.
[28466.49s -> 28471.61s]  It is just an inflammation in my rib cage the way they connect in the front of the sternum and in
[28471.61s -> 28478.89s]  the back of the spine. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do about it. There's only one
[28478.89s -> 28483.69s]  thing you can really do about costochondritis. Hope it goes away on its own. Which it does for
[28483.69s -> 28488.97s]  a lot of people. Sometimes it takes six months. Sometimes it takes 10 years. But it can go away.
[28489.77s -> 28495.78s]  Or you do physical therapy to try to correct it. To try to alleviate some of the pain and the
[28495.78s -> 28504.26s]  symptoms. That's another route. The other route is to get a nerve blocking injection into my ribs
[28504.26s -> 28511.56s]  in like six or five or six places around the spots where it hurts. And then it's gone. But you may
[28511.56s -> 28518.18s]  have to do that injection more than once. You may have to do those injections every three or four
[28518.18s -> 28524.42s]  months. I was told some people get an injection for two or three or four and it goes away forever
[28524.42s -> 28530.65s]  and it never comes back. I've also been told by the same doctor that for some people the pain
[28530.65s -> 28542.17s]  comes back in like a month and you have to do it again. So I am going to be doing physical therapy.
[28543.13s -> 28550.33s]  I don't like the idea of going right and jumping the gun and blocking nerves with injections. I don't
[28550.33s -> 28557.82s]  want to do that yet. If I have to I will. But I want to do physical therapy first. That's the plan.
[28557.82s -> 28565.43s]  And that's sort of what this whole thing has turned out to be. Like it makes a lot of sense
[28565.43s -> 28571.35s]  because I can lean back and I can put a little pressure on my chest. And if I lean back the
[28571.35s -> 28577.72s]  middle of my chest and sternum just pop pop pop hurt hurt hurt. Same thing if I lean to the left
[28577.72s -> 28581.80s]  or right I can feel it in the back of my ribs the way my ribs connect to my spine. It's like
[28582.84s -> 28593.53s]  and that's also another reason why I haven't done green screen stuff yet. I just need to get the okay
[28593.53s -> 28600.38s]  and it's like okay now turning doesn't hurt and leaning back and forward doesn't hurt you know
[28600.38s -> 28611.02s]  I'm saying. Just trying to get to that point. Costochondritis inflammation in my rib cage where
[28611.02s -> 28619.38s]  they connect. Don't know why I have it. It just do. But that's pretty much how that story goes.
[28622.39s -> 28629.27s]  The good thing is I've had a lot of tests. I've had spinal MRIs. I've had abdominal MRIs. They've
[28629.27s -> 28634.79s]  looked at all my organs. I've had tons of tests. They checked all my fucking my kidneys and my
[28634.79s -> 28643.05s]  liver and everything seems to be in working order. So I've been told that this is not a serious
[28643.05s -> 28657.54s]  condition. It's just one that you have you have now. So and with that that's where we're going to
[28657.54s -> 28664.36s]  end the stream tonight. Thanks everybody for watching. See you tomorrow around two-ish one
[28664.36s -> 28670.17s]  to two-ish probably 2 p.m pacific for more Outer Smiles.
