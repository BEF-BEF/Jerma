[2.04s -> 18.33s]  Hey, hey, how are you doing? How are you doing? Good. I'm gonna just make a tweet real quick.
[19.13s -> 39.18s]  Hey, Vod Watchers. What's up? Hold in ring. All right. Screaming. I'm not gonna scream today. I
[39.18s -> 45.46s]  need to save my voice because we're going, we're gonna go hard. I can't, I can't blow my voice out
[45.46s -> 52.10s]  day one out of like two or three in a row, like 10 hours. You know what I mean? We should be collected
[52.10s -> 64.22s]  today. Tomorrow, we can do whatever we can. I can be as loud as I want, right? Okay, how about
[64.22s -> 78.50s]  Elden Ring? I'm ready. That sounds good. It kind of makes it sound like I'm just starting the game,
[78.50s -> 90.12s]  though, doesn't it? Oh, well. Okay. Welcome back. It's been a few days. I definitely wanted to take
[90.12s -> 95.16s]  a few days. I thought I was only going to need to take two days, but I got up on the third day
[95.88s -> 104.34s]  and was like, maybe I should just relax. Just go chill. Not scream or yell or tense my body up.
[105.30s -> 110.20s]  Here's the thing about these games, right? When you play one of these games, you don't even
[110.20s -> 115.32s]  realize you're doing it, but you are exercising your entire body. You are exercising your blood
[115.32s -> 123.21s]  vessels to everything. Every inch of your body is doing a lifting routine. Your stomach tightens
[123.21s -> 131.18s]  up your arms, tighten up your neck, your jaw. Guys, I woke up like the third day, my teeth hurt.
[131.98s -> 135.02s]  It was weird. It was like, wow, my teeth were exercised somehow. How
[135.02s -> 151.18s]  cool. People think I'm fucking whatever. I'm just fucking kidding. All the grinding. Yeah,
[151.18s -> 154.86s]  I don't know what happened, man. My teeth got a workout. It's like, no, dude, you were
[154.86s -> 160.17s]  clenching your throat. But we're going to keep playing. I know that people are going to,
[161.05s -> 166.73s]  this is an Elden Ring channel. I know. But for the first time in about half a decade,
[167.53s -> 170.57s]  there's a game that I think is really interesting and I'm going to just play the hell out of it.
[171.69s -> 176.25s]  I expect way more streams, right? Like I'm going to do three, four plus days in a row with this game.
[176.97s -> 180.57s]  I do have to be careful because I don't want to go too crazy. I'm going to go too hard.
[181.29s -> 185.21s]  So we'll see how I feel tonight. How long we go. We might go long today. Very long.
[186.50s -> 191.78s]  Into the early evening hours, probably early evening. I mean, late evening, early morning.
[194.34s -> 198.66s]  We will after this weekend, even if I don't, I don't plan on beating this game
[199.22s -> 204.34s]  this weekend. Even if I go two, three hard kind of days in a row or like one day,
[204.34s -> 207.46s]  day off three days or something or two days, right? However, I'm going to do it.
[208.18s -> 210.98s]  Definitely not going to beat the game this weekend. So I got to figure out what I want
[210.98s -> 218.12s]  to do content wise with Elden Ring because just because there's no way I'm going to beat it.
[219.00s -> 225.32s]  So does this just become a permanent game that happens every week or so that, you know,
[225.32s -> 228.44s]  there's just going to be an Elden Ring stream that's just going to happen as we progress
[228.44s -> 233.61s]  through the game. And we just do other stuff too in the meantime. That's a possibility too.
[233.61s -> 237.93s]  But as it stands right now, this is what we're doing. This is the plan. I'm still super into it.
[237.93s -> 244.98s]  I have not played. I did make a new character because I wanted to play, but then I stepped
[244.98s -> 250.42s]  back because that new character was way different than the character that I play on stream. I have
[250.42s -> 256.68s]  about 12 minutes with a new character and I just got, it's like a big two-handed swing pattern.
[256.68s -> 259.72s]  I didn't want to get used to that. I want to just stay muscle memory with the guy that I have.
[260.52s -> 267.42s]  Astrologer? No, the name was Mee Strong and they look like a caveman and they have a big club.
[268.06s -> 272.04s]  That's my new, one of my new characters I've been playing with off stream.
[273.85s -> 277.69s]  But yeah, let's keep going. I, this is what we're doing for the next couple of days at least.
[278.25s -> 287.86s]  I need to study, but I can't stop playing Elden Ring. Yeah, it'll be here though. And it's,
[287.86s -> 293.64s]  there's a lot. We also have to clean up the notes because the notes look like shit. And I also want
[293.64s -> 300.36s]  to be, make it very, very clear before we get started. I got a big zit on my face. It's huge.
[300.36s -> 304.28s]  It's going to be incredibly distracting for me. It's going to be, it's going to be so distracting
[304.28s -> 312.55s]  for you. Just know that I shaved and I had like a bunch of Elden Ring stress sits. So it's, it
[312.55s -> 320.95s]  looks awful. It looks really bad. I just need to get it out there because the second I turn the
[320.95s -> 327.35s]  camera on, all I'm going to see is in all capitals, zit. So I'm just getting in front of it because
[327.35s -> 335.03s]  fuck it. You know what I mean? I'm in control now, right? Like I am in control now. Yeah, I don't
[335.03s -> 344.30s]  know. I'm getting the Elden Ring stress sits. All right. Hold on. It's almost time. Almost time.
[344.86s -> 358.46s]  Hold on. Wait a second. I'm really excited to play though, because I have not played
[359.62s -> 363.54s]  my character. I went in my character's inventory very briefly. Just looked at stuff for a few
[363.54s -> 371.11s]  minutes, but I have not walked away from the bonfire that I was at. We, I'm in that spot and
[371.11s -> 377.38s]  I can't hide it anymore. Can't hide it anymore. People are going to see my like freshly shaven
[377.38s -> 382.98s]  zit face and whatever. It's okay. I'm okay with it. I'm not, I'm okay with it. I'm okay with it.
[398.47s -> 404.38s]  It's a beauty mark. It's not a, it's a beauty mark. I already said, oh fuck. It's naughty. Look,
[404.38s -> 412.28s]  it's fine. And then like I made it so much worse because you know, you're in the mirror like,
[413.24s -> 416.68s]  what do I do about it? And then you make it so much worse. It gets infected.
[416.68s -> 421.40s]  I like accidentally shaved it off with the razor and I was like, God damn it. And then when it was
[421.40s -> 425.72s]  shaved off, I'm like, wait a minute, hold on. And then I, and now it's, it's over and now it's fine.
[432.18s -> 437.72s]  This is not, this is not herpes. What are you talking about? I don't have, this is not,
[437.72s -> 444.70s]  what are you, what? All right. Time that person up for fucking 10 seconds. It's herpes. You're
[444.70s -> 452.15s]  gonna, now I'm going to get angry. Are you sure you're 40? Dude, anybody can get, I don't really
[452.15s -> 459.19s]  get that many pieces of acne anymore. Like I'm sorry. Like this is, my cortisol levels while
[459.19s -> 463.59s]  I've been playing Elden Ring have been like a hundred, a hundred percent. So I mean, of course,
[463.59s -> 469.67s]  but my cortisol level is increasing and my like, I'm getting like very stressed and angry and it's
[469.67s -> 475.43s]  always really sweaty in here. And I shaved, it's going to happen. Like even though you,
[475.43s -> 479.27s]  I don't even matter how old I am. By the way, you never, never ask somebody how old they are.
[479.99s -> 494.50s]  Are you kidding me? All right, here we go. We're going to get started. Elden Ring part four. I
[494.50s -> 503.43s]  don't, I don't even, I have no idea. All right, let's load game. There's a, there's me strong
[503.43s -> 510.86s]  and I may have, I may have, okay, this is an hour, but that's not true. That's not true. I sat,
[510.86s -> 516.94s]  I sat there testing to see if I, my laptop could handle the game. And I was doing like a temperature
[516.94s -> 521.18s]  test because my laptop, I don't think it can handle it. Cause I was thinking I could play like in bed
[521.18s -> 525.74s]  with my laptop. So I just kind of sat there and did like a temperature test to see if I could like
[525.74s -> 532.95s]  even play the game. So you're not, you guys are never going to see me strong by the way. There's
[532.95s -> 539.03s]  no way it's never going to happen. That's the character that I play only off stream for me.
[539.99s -> 549.32s]  You're not going to get to see me strong. I'm really sorry. He's addicted. No, I was addicted
[549.32s -> 553.85s]  to trying to find out if I could play it potentially like not in the bathroom. All right,
[553.85s -> 558.17s]  here we go. So we've got, what do we got? Turn it up a little bit. I can't really hear it.
[558.81s -> 569.08s]  Why is his name Edgward? I don't know. This is the first thing that somebody said. He's gatekeeping
[569.08s -> 574.63s]  his character from us. No, I just, that's my off stream character and I didn't want to play as him
[574.63s -> 580.63s]  because the swing timings are so off that I would get used to over the last two days playing with
[580.63s -> 587.13s]  me strong. And I would, I would get on here and I would complain to you guys that I couldn't play
[587.13s -> 590.81s]  right. It would be so annoying. It'd be like, no, but you don't understand this, but the swing
[590.81s -> 594.17s]  timings on my other character are so different that that's why I got hit three times. I don't
[594.17s -> 598.94s]  want to give, even give you guys the firepower for that. All right. So last thing happened,
[598.94s -> 604.94s]  I beat Loretta. I got this, which is really cool. Those of you that missed it, this is the great
[604.94s -> 611.66s]  bow. Really, really interested in how this is going to work because I feel like that's going
[611.66s -> 617.82s]  to be cool. What's on your face? Yeah, whatever. I knew it was going to happen. That's why I got
[617.82s -> 624.49s]  in front of it. You're just in that, like, if I never said anything, it would just be like,
[624.49s -> 630.01s]  it would just be like zit. I told you, and this is that person just came to the spring like five
[630.01s -> 635.24s]  minutes ago. All right, let's go. So last thing that I did, I beat Loretta. There's way more stuff
[635.24s -> 639.00s]  going on here. So I didn't even, I didn't even look around this area. So let me look around.
[640.07s -> 647.22s]  Don't listen to them. I'm not going to listen to them. Let's see what's over this way. I have
[647.22s -> 650.58s]  been very itching and excited to play this. Okay. There's this, I can go up this way,
[651.38s -> 661.37s]  which seems to lead out. All right, hold on. Not yet. There's a place to go up here. We have a zit
[661.37s -> 666.79s]  cam. You mean you want me to zoom in, crop this and put it as big as the face cam and have it be
[666.79s -> 678.52s]  the zit. No, I want new viewers to not like write threads about how fucking annoying I am.
[679.99s -> 688.50s]  No, that's gross. That's just actually disgusting. That's actually gross. Like that would be that if
[688.50s -> 692.66s]  I saw somebody doing that, it'd be like, that's fucking okay. You're like trying, you're like
[692.66s -> 696.66s]  trying to really put this like, Oh, look at how gross and like weird we are. Like, no, that's
[696.66s -> 702.20s]  fucking I don't want to do that. Not happening. So what there's nothing here. I thought there'd be
[702.20s -> 720.41s]  something important here. I guess not. Big statue, rub pizza on it and see how big it gets.
[721.05s -> 733.56s]  All right. Well, we're going out here, put a sensor bar on it. I move around too much. It's
[733.56s -> 741.18s]  not going to happen. Okay. Here we go. Three sisters, three sisters, by the way, in case,
[741.18s -> 749.43s]  in case anybody thought there was a problem, I've got it. A lot of you just exhale the sigh of
[749.43s -> 757.77s]  relief. Of course I do. There's a giant, there's literally a, there's literally a giant dragon
[757.77s -> 767.00s]  over there on the left. I'm going to go on the right. I have my horse frame dropped. What?
[801.13s -> 808.46s]  Okay. I think it's okay. I think we're okay. That may have been temporary. It might show up again.
[809.18s -> 814.65s]  Remember you need lip fillers. Actually, thanks for reminding me, but I don't know where it is.
[815.29s -> 824.49s]  Frames aren't great. I don't know. That's weird. Sometimes randomly. It seems like the last like
[825.13s -> 830.97s]  few months, once every like few weeks, we'll get like an F for like 40 minutes and then it's fine
[830.97s -> 845.24s]  permanently. That's weird. Okay. Here we go. I want to go around this edge. Is this actually
[845.24s -> 858.06s]  the edge of the world or is there more? There's more all the way up here? No, there's not. Isn't
[858.06s -> 875.16s]  this the edge of the world? Oh, hold on. You sound like people that are interviewed to replace you.
[878.74s -> 889.16s]  Wait, you just distracted me. I said no yelling frozen armament. What is that? What is floating
[889.16s -> 897.62s]  over us? Why is it like a, why is there like a spaceship floating above us? That was weird. You
[897.62s -> 913.93s]  saw that? All right. All right. Get off. I got to check out rave side. I'm going to see what that
[913.93s -> 929.21s]  item is. Frozen thing. What level am I? I am. Oh shit. Hold on. Are you dead? I am level 51. 51.
[929.21s -> 934.76s]  Those of you that want to see what my loadout is, I will show it because there might be some new
[934.76s -> 939.93s]  people here that just are dropping by for the first time. Uh, I got the carrion night sword,
[939.93s -> 944.09s]  which scales with intelligence and dexterity, which is exactly what I'm doing. I've got the
[944.09s -> 951.48s]  carrion glint blade staff soon to be replaced with the Azores glint stone staff. I'm not
[951.48s -> 964.41s]  overleveled dot 51. You look younger. I'm doing like a half and half kind of deck slash int weapon
[964.41s -> 976.60s]  build. Very happy with it so far. And we're still gone. Okay. I'm just, so somebody actually just
[976.60s -> 994.68s]  say again, shut up. Noob sidebar. Ooh, everybody said that. Who is saying this? I don't know. I
[994.68s -> 998.52s]  saw guys sometimes have to fill in the blanks. I get shit sometimes because people go,
[998.52s -> 1002.68s]  dude, he like read half of a sentence and then just like made up the rest. Yeah, I did because
[1002.68s -> 1007.00s]  like I can't read it that fast. So if you say in your message and I catch it and it's like,
[1007.64s -> 1012.04s]  Hey dude, I have such a huge fan of Bert and you're like, all I can see is the B you are.
[1012.04s -> 1014.60s]  I'm going to be like, Oh, Burger King. Like you're a huge fan of Burger King. All right, man.
[1015.56s -> 1022.97s]  Like that's cool. I guess I'm going to fill it in. I want to see what that spell is.
[1024.31s -> 1032.25s]  Rosen armament. Enchant arm is held in the right hand with frost. Really? But I can't
[1032.25s -> 1045.82s]  enchant this weapon. That's really cool though. I kind of wish I could. Will you ever use your
[1045.82s -> 1050.86s]  pouch? It's actually really super useful. Um, you mean like this here? Yeah, I got to,
[1051.42s -> 1055.93s]  I got to figure that out. I got to figure that out. All right. So this is going this way,
[1055.93s -> 1061.64s]  but I don't want to go this way. There seems to be a lot of stuff this year. I have 10,000 souls.
[1061.64s -> 1073.38s]  First of all, be careful. I don't want to die. I need more of this glove war. Yes, exactly what
[1073.38s -> 1085.48s]  I wanted. I need glove war too, which is exactly what I just got. All right. This is going to lead
[1085.48s -> 1092.01s]  to a whole new area. All right. There was more to do in that area back here. Let me know. I don't
[1092.01s -> 1101.38s]  want to get too overwhelmed. Don't overwhelm me. Stop overwhelming me. Still dropping frames. Is
[1101.38s -> 1107.43s]  it still happening? It'll, it'll even out. It evened out last time. Last time there was an issue,
[1107.43s -> 1113.43s]  it was at like four or five o'clock and it resolved itself in like 30 minutes. So it should be okay.
[1114.31s -> 1122.14s]  All right. So this is where we are. I want to go back here because there's an area to go this way.
[1123.02s -> 1135.54s]  Check it out. The zip and the shave makes you look like you're 20.
[1136.18s -> 1154.95s]  Could you do a Garfield impression? Yeah, I think I could. I could try. Yeah, maybe. That's the best
[1154.95s -> 1166.17s]  you're going to get. All right. This is where I want to be. Who am I in combat with? So I want to
[1166.17s -> 1173.40s]  go over here. Let's try here first because this looks, this looks pretty interesting. Let's go.
[1177.02s -> 1189.10s]  Yep. Yep. Something in here. I haven't go in here. Renna's rise locked shut for now.
[1190.82s -> 1200.90s]  What do you mean blocked shut for now? What? Okay. What about over here or over here? I want to check
[1200.90s -> 1209.46s]  these. Renna's rise frames. I know. I don't know why it's happening. It doesn't make any sense.
[1213.82s -> 1217.02s]  Okay. Let's check these places. I actually, right. I got to clean up the notepad. You're right. Let's
[1217.02s -> 1223.70s]  do that first. Uh, these, I already did this. This was that area that I got the, um,
[1223.70s -> 1231.06s]  that weird snake, uh, monster thing. I already did that. Uh, I already did that. Didn't do this
[1231.06s -> 1237.48s]  prawn guy. This sea offer thing. I did it already. This can stay and this can stay. All right. So
[1239.46s -> 1250.98s]  Renna, Renna's is closed for now. I, I guess. I don't know. It might be Twitch. I don't know.
[1250.98s -> 1257.90s]  It's not Twitch. This is definitely coming from my end. All right. So that's Renna's is closed
[1257.90s -> 1265.00s]  for now. And I guess that that's all I need to know. That's good. Let's go check out. Uh, yeah.
[1265.00s -> 1267.88s]  There's like a dragon over here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. First of all,
[1267.88s -> 1276.95s]  like this, I got so much shit on my map. Get rid of that. What are the crap is on here? Just one.
[1276.95s -> 1285.50s]  I don't want any more than that. How do I get rid of all markers? Four and five of the, okay.
[1286.22s -> 1293.75s]  I don't want three anymore either. All right. This, this dragon here. What am I supposed to do
[1293.75s -> 1302.70s]  about this? Just kill this. What was it? Is it a dragon? It is. Okay. Wait, I don't want to fight
[1302.70s -> 1315.72s]  that right now. I have 10,000 souls. That'd be a mistake. I'm being so rude about it. This is it.
[1317.46s -> 1325.82s]  Yeah. Tell them are you going to beat every single boss? I don't think so because I really,
[1325.82s -> 1329.34s]  I kind of want another play through to be able to have stuff that I haven't seen, which is
[1329.34s -> 1334.62s]  kind of interesting to me. So I'm going to do the ones that I find or the ones that I'm interested
[1334.62s -> 1349.56s]  in. Right. What is that? Ranny's rise. Wait, Ranny, Brenna. Oh, the three sisters. Okay. Well,
[1349.56s -> 1362.12s]  this one's open. What the hell is this? Oh, someone's going to be mad about that.
[1363.00s -> 1367.24s]  Imagine somebody just w I can imagine I was just wasn't here. Somebody walked into my streaming
[1367.24s -> 1372.30s]  setup and just took a two-handed great sword and just crashed through the middle of it and then
[1372.30s -> 1394.20s]  left. And they didn't take anything. So what is going on in here? I wonder if I, you probably
[1394.20s -> 1399.16s]  have to fight the three sisters, right? I would be surprised if you didn't, especially because
[1399.16s -> 1408.55s]  there's a bonfire right here. Oh, I did my routine this morning, by the way. I did my,
[1409.67s -> 1418.49s]  I did my Elden Ring routine. The Elden Ring routine was I got up, I took a nice like warm shower.
[1419.45s -> 1426.09s]  I made a salad and this salad, by the way, is very healthy. It's half spinach, half spring mix.
[1426.73s -> 1429.45s]  And then just do a little bit of olive oil on that. Don't do anything else.
[1430.09s -> 1435.61s]  Eat that. Let that just get inside you. Let that like kind of coagulate inside of your body. Get
[1435.61s -> 1442.87s]  it good. Make a green tea. And here we are. Like I am actually like, I am full up. I'm ready to go.
[1442.87s -> 1448.42s]  Like that's how I play Elden Ring. I eat like a salad is absolutely awesome here. All right. Wait,
[1448.42s -> 1456.46s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to level up. Do I have enough to level up though?
[1456.46s -> 1468.89s]  Probably not. What is this? How much is it for me to level up? 16, 17 thousand? I don't want to die
[1468.89s -> 1477.21s]  like five times. All right. I can get 50. I can get that right now. Just give me a sec. All right.
[1477.21s -> 1483.61s]  I can come right back here. Makes me want to have some more green. Does that even count as a salad?
[1484.25s -> 1490.78s]  Um, yeah, of course it does. Let me just get some souls. I don't want to go up here and die
[1490.78s -> 1500.49s]  and lose 15k. It'd be horrible. I have to fight the hand enemies again, which I said this is
[1500.49s -> 1505.85s]  actually not a bad idea. I, I, I was like very, very tired when I got here and very annoyed.
[1506.49s -> 1509.93s]  So I think now that I'm refreshed and ready to go, this is a guy I want to explore a little bit
[1509.93s -> 1519.24s]  here because this place with the hands that actually scared the fucking shit out of me.
[1519.24s -> 1524.84s]  That like, that was the worst one so far of the whole game, but I'm not kidding. That hurt.
[1524.84s -> 1561.83s]  That actually hurt my body. Damn it. These enemies suck so bad. These guys are the worst.
[1562.71s -> 1568.87s]  Yeah. Like, what was that? You get it? Like, what was that little like, it's, it's that,
[1568.87s -> 1570.79s]  what is it? You know what I mean? How do you can even tell what he's even doing?
[1571.59s -> 1576.23s]  All right. There we go. Finally. That was horrible. My whole, I hurt a lot.
[1576.79s -> 1583.50s]  Okay. So this is, yeah, this is good because I can actually explore over here and not just be a
[1583.50s -> 1598.81s]  dipshit. Don't. All right. Fine. No more huge ones. Attention streamer, attention streamer,
[1598.81s -> 1605.77s]  circle behind the hands. Dude, I have to get another flask upgrade. I'm at plus one still.
[1605.77s -> 1628.47s]  I got to get like a plus two or plus three attention streamer. Okay. I'll try it. It's
[1628.47s -> 1635.99s]  easier said than done when they take up the whole fucking goddamn screen. Don't lose these.
[1637.11s -> 1639.83s]  Oh my fucking God. These hands are the worst enemy in the whole game.
[1640.55s -> 1652.14s]  Without us, without a solitary doubt in my mind. Crystal bud. Yeah. Eat shit. Your hand.
[1652.14s -> 1661.29s]  Fuck. Yeah. You can't, you, you can't like how, what the these guys are fucking unbearable.
[1661.93s -> 1674.38s]  I couldn't even get around him. He, he, his hitbox is this. He goes, almost just dropped like a
[1674.38s -> 1688.09s]  bunch of stuff. All right. He's fire. I don't have fire. I don't have, I'm sorcery. All right. Go
[1688.09s -> 1699.53s]  ahead and come out of the ground. You fucking piece of shit. Where is he? He's like right here.
[1703.42s -> 1715.08s]  Really? Does not do very much. All right. Circle attention streamer, attention streamer,
[1715.08s -> 1756.14s]  get around his back. Thank you. Appreciate it. He's using the joke weapon. This is not,
[1756.22s -> 1761.37s]  how is this a joke weapon? This thing's awesome. This is not a joke weapon.
[1764.76s -> 1772.18s]  Joke weapon? These knight swords could serve as catalysts, letting them wield sorcerous
[1772.18s -> 1779.38s]  battle skills. Despite numbering fewer than 20, this power made them a match for even the champions
[1779.38s -> 1788.81s]  of gold in battle. It's a joke weapon? Where's the comedy paragraph? That is, this is a knight's
[1788.81s -> 1800.42s]  sword for a carrion knight. There's no joke paragraph. All right. I almost have enough.
[1800.42s -> 1829.10s]  Where is he? He's a great air. Where are you? Oh, hi. Hello. Hey, hey game. What the fuck was that?
[1830.39s -> 1849.86s]  Why can't I walk onto this guy? What the fuck? What? There's so many fucking trees in the goddamn
[1849.86s -> 1854.86s]  way. Somebody fucking rocks. Like I come down here so I can actually fight your dumb ass enemy.
[1873.56s -> 1887.14s]  Dude, stop turning around so fucking fast. I hate these things. These things just make me angry.
[1888.46s -> 1892.14s]  You know, you got that like one enemy in any of these souls games that just like makes you
[1892.14s -> 1897.58s]  remarkably fucking angry, remarkably angry. Like you, you can't stand being sitting in the seat
[1897.58s -> 1907.58s]  when you, when they show up is this guy. These, these, these big hands make me remarkably upset.
[1907.58s -> 1917.72s]  Like it's unbelievable how bad they make me. So let's see. What else did I not see over here?
[1918.20s -> 1927.29s]  I swear to God, I didn't even see it. All right. Just run. Like fuck, fuck this whole place. I
[1927.29s -> 1931.29s]  like, seriously, I don't care. They could literally be a sorcery item that kills every boss in one
[1931.29s -> 1936.01s]  hit literally over there. I don't even care. I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it.
[1936.01s -> 1960.89s]  I don't want it. I will do this though. I think it doesn't do that much damage. Oh, you bet your
[1960.89s -> 1976.49s]  ass. I'm going to sit here and do this. I need the souls. If he kills me, I'm going to be fucking
[1976.49s -> 1988.89s]  furious. How did you get in here? What? How did you get in here? Oh my God. I'm fucking mad. I
[1988.89s -> 1992.73s]  got to kill this guy because it's the only way that'll satiate my anger is killing this guy
[1992.73s -> 2015.24s]  right now. Holy shit. I'm going to cheese this shit out of this guy. I hate these fucking things.
[2016.12s -> 2025.11s]  I don't like, I don't like them, dude. I can't, it's just, I can't, I don't care. I'm leaving.
[2026.46s -> 2032.81s]  I'm leaving. He just moves too quickly. I don't care. Like I can run his head into the wall the
[2032.81s -> 2040.54s]  whole time. What do I have? 13? I need 15. Those guys don't even get that much souls either.
[2040.54s -> 2048.60s]  There's such a pain in the ass that you can't, it's, give me the other spot. Like down here
[2048.60s -> 2060.18s]  or somewhere else. Yeah. I'm, I'm leaving the world's worst area. This guy's back too. All
[2060.18s -> 2068.07s]  right. 34 minutes in and then the mauled has started. Oh, just those hands. That's it. I
[2068.07s -> 2071.27s]  promise. I won't get mad for another 30 minutes as long as no fucking hands are involved.
[2072.15s -> 2087.88s]  I got to, I got to find somebody to kill. When there's somebody like right out here,
[2087.96s -> 2094.92s]  this is where like the lightning stuff was happening. No, no, I'm back. I'm back here at
[2094.92s -> 2108.63s]  the end place. All right. No more complaining. I'm killing these hands right now. Get down here. No,
[2108.63s -> 2118.42s]  get down here. Get down here. Go. Not two. I don't want to, not two, not two, not two. I would have
[2118.42s -> 2136.86s]  done one. Oh my God. I hate these motherfuckers so much. I don't even want to be here, but like my
[2136.86s -> 2142.30s]  body keeps gravitating back here. Cause I fucking hate this place so much. I want to wipe this whole
[2142.30s -> 2152.81s]  place out. The boys betrayed you and I, it took too long to cast. All right. I'm just getting my
[2152.81s -> 2198.04s]  souls and leaving. I just need a few thousand. Get them right here. All right. Give me 2000 souls,
[2198.04s -> 2227.42s]  please. Thank you. Oh shit. Now let's get the boys involved too. Why not? I can upgrade the boys
[2227.42s -> 2248.95s]  again, by the way. Look at how much better of an idea this was. This is so much smarter. Why would
[2248.95s -> 2257.03s]  I even, why would I torture myself with the stupid hand enemy when I could just go on a like exp trip?
[2257.59s -> 2273.53s]  Oh, I got a helmet. All right, gone a little bit more. That's it. One more.
[2273.53s -> 2282.28s]  Everybody else die. I picked it to be you. All right. Goodbye. Thanks for the experience.
[2283.00s -> 2300.70s]  Appreciate it. All right. Let's go over there. They're chasing me. Okay. Well kill these guys.
[2305.16s -> 2312.73s]  What the fuck? He must have killed me in one hit. All right. Give me out. Let's go.
[2317.11s -> 2320.63s]  Okay. We're ready. We're good. Everything is fine. Everybody can relax.
[2321.51s -> 2329.86s]  Everything is good. Nothing is, there's no problem. Why are you getting zits at 42? Did you know that
[2329.86s -> 2334.74s]  it doesn't matter how old you are? You can still get pimples all the way through to your like 80.
[2337.85s -> 2353.88s]  Ooh, look what we can do now. I have a hundred mana. I have 100 mana. Oleg can actually show
[2353.88s -> 2365.72s]  up now. Okay. Let's give it a try. There's Oleg. I wonder how good Oleg is. It takes the entire
[2365.72s -> 2371.90s]  mana bar, by the way. Okay. Now I'm safe. I'm comfortable. I'm going to go up. Are you ready?
[2373.88s -> 2377.88s]  Use the pouch for the summons. You know what? What a fucking brilliant person you really are.
[2379.43s -> 2386.15s]  Let's take this off here and let's get those. Where's the pouch? Like equipment pouch, right?
[2386.15s -> 2393.99s]  Is this it? Where is it? How do I get a pouch? Is there a way to do it? Does it have to be in
[2393.99s -> 2405.24s]  the inventory? Which right? How do I do it? It's the first screen. How do I switch to the pouch?
[2405.88s -> 2416.52s]  Right side of the first screen. Oh shit. Okay. How do I assign something? Switch. Okay. I will go
[2416.52s -> 2427.90s]  right stick for Oleg, right D pad. We'll do left D pad for the boys and then down D pad for the
[2427.90s -> 2434.63s]  dogs. This is actually so much more useful. Why the hell did I not do this? Okay. So then I can
[2434.63s -> 2440.70s]  go like this. Yeah, that's much better. Cool. Thank you. I'm so glad that actually I haven't
[2440.70s -> 2444.46s]  streamed this in like three days. So you guys like know how to do like all like the actual quality
[2444.46s -> 2451.53s]  of life stuff that I didn't pay attention to because I know a shitload of you guys are at
[2451.53s -> 2479.13s]  least like a full day ahead of me now. So I'm grateful. All right, let's do it. All right.
[2479.13s -> 2487.98s]  Oh, it's you. What do you have? Oh, again, we cross paths. I believe I said my name was Renna.
[2488.54s -> 2492.95s]  Last we met. Is it a lie? It pleaseth me to see torrent hail and hearty,
[2493.51s -> 2500.87s]  but tarnished. What business hast thou here? I have no memory of ink and thee in invitation.
[2502.94s -> 2507.66s]  No particular reason. No particular reason in particular thou claimest. Intrigued,
[2508.86s -> 2515.26s]  then mayhaps fate have steered thee to this reunion. Wilt thou enter into my service?
[2515.98s -> 2522.33s]  I am the witch, Ronnie. I stole death long ago. Then you say name was Rana? I search now for the
[2522.33s -> 2528.49s]  dark path. What's your name? That I might wonder. What's this person's name? And the world of all
[2528.49s -> 2538.81s]  that came before. Has that roused thy interest? Serve Ronnie the witch. I don't, um, I don't know
[2538.81s -> 2558.02s]  if I should do this. I don't know what this does. I'm afraid. I'm afraid. I see. I did it. A choice
[2558.02s -> 2567.64s]  well made. Thou art a rare sword. Do I get witch sorceries? But I require as much of those under
[2567.64s -> 2573.24s]  my command. Why am I under your command? Good work from thee. I thought you were gonna,
[2573.96s -> 2579.29s]  I thought this was like I was gonna like do like a couple of little gigs for you. I didn't think I
[2579.29s -> 2586.95s]  was gonna be like under your command. Good. Then I ask we proceed with haste. There is in my service
[2587.59s -> 2594.82s]  a half-woven warrior by the name of Blythe. I would have thee join him in searching for
[2594.82s -> 2601.64s]  the hidden treasure of Nocron. The eternal treasure. I have called for Blythe to greet thee below.
[2601.64s -> 2607.40s]  What? Take from him the particulars. Wait, are we gonna like ride together somewhere? And there
[2607.40s -> 2616.18s]  will thou find E.G. or Canceller and Salavis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts also. Okay,
[2616.18s -> 2624.18s]  there's more people? Are we about to do like a, are we about to become like the wizard of Oz?
[2624.18s -> 2633.18s]  Are we gonna have like four people? Okay. Speak with the three who await below.
[2633.82s -> 2649.46s]  Okay, so they're just waiting for me below? I'm very interested. All right, let's go.
[2650.26s -> 2670.09s]  Are we gonna go kill the dragon together? I'm very interested right now. Is that them? Oh no,
[2670.09s -> 2684.86s]  that's just like a brass. Wait, who's this? What do you want? Is this the blacksmith?
[2692.38s -> 2716.15s]  Okay. Okay, what's your guidance? Don't underestimate me.
[2732.78s -> 2739.00s]  What? Okay, let us give all that we can. Sure. All right, well, what are you gonna,
[2739.08s -> 2745.19s]  what kind of potions are you gonna give me? Where's the sack of jewels that just are gonna
[2745.19s -> 2751.69s]  help us on our journey? All right, so are they outside? Am I drinking? That is matcha.
[2752.49s -> 2773.00s]  It's a green tea matcha powdered drink. Okay.
[2782.10s -> 2788.30s]  The well in the Mistwood. The well in the Mistwood. Let me write that down. Me.
[2789.10s -> 2817.98s]  I write that down? Okay. Well in the Mistwood. Okay. All right, well in the Mistwood for the
[2818.70s -> 2832.46s]  worgen guy. And then, wait, is that all you have to say? See if I can't. I won't, I won't,
[2832.46s -> 2841.38s]  I won't. Well, how can, well, how come, why are they force ghosts? I see. You must be Rani's new
[2842.26s -> 2843.06s]  I kind of like this person.
[2848.90s -> 2853.54s]  Celibus. I like this, I like this person.
[2858.18s -> 2870.95s]  I like this person. So where are you gonna be?
[2871.11s -> 2874.39s]  I reside in another tower.
[2878.10s -> 2884.50s]  Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Rani? If it were up to me,
[2884.50s -> 2891.94s]  I wouldn't waste my time on the likes of you. But who am I to stand against the wishes of my lady?
[2892.90s -> 2898.50s]  Okay, very cool. Turn the sound up. Yeah, it looks like it was a little low. I got you.
[2899.30s -> 2908.95s]  I got you. Sound going up. I reside in another tower. Because I reside in another tower.
[2910.71s -> 2915.86s]  Do I have to pick one of these three that I want to play with?
[2918.65s -> 2921.77s]  Oh, you're in one, you're in this one or this one? Does it matter?
[2923.59s -> 2932.79s]  Where's the Mistwood? Mistwood. Where is that? Have I not found that yet? Where's Mistwood?
[2933.43s -> 2949.06s]  It's east of Limgrave. Mistwood. Okay. He died, he did say Limgrave. But what about the guy with the
[2949.06s -> 2958.95s]  hat? What about the guy with the hat? This choice will have consequences. What? What about the big
[2958.95s -> 2964.01s]  guy? Did he even say where he was gonna be? Wait, I know where he is. Oh no, I have to pick one of
[2964.01s -> 2979.56s]  these three? So let me get- Okay, I've got a prediction. Oh no. There are no choices? Oh,
[2979.64s -> 2983.90s]  there's not a choice. Okay. All right. All right. All right. So if that doesn't matter,
[2983.90s -> 2987.50s]  I was kind of concerned. So I'm going to go to that. But first, I'm going to go to the tower
[2987.50s -> 2994.95s]  where this guy is. You don't get to pick. It's okay. All right. All right. So I want to go to
[2994.95s -> 3000.33s]  this tower. I think it's this one here. Unless it was the one that was closed before. But I'm going
[3000.33s -> 3011.90s]  to check this place out. That is so cool. I'm really excited. Because there's this one here.
[3014.92s -> 3025.88s]  Or choice matters. Well, all right. I'm gonna I'm literally gonna excuse me. What's going on here?
[3025.88s -> 3034.54s]  This is an invisible wall. That's odd. That shouldn't be here. I'm screwed up there. Go
[3034.54s -> 3046.30s]  talk to Ronnie first. Okay. Why can't I leave? It's because I can't. Why I can't leave the zone.
[3046.94s -> 3060.10s]  I have to go talk to Ronnie or I can't leave. Okay. This seems pretty cool. I'm actually pretty
[3060.10s -> 3082.49s]  excited for this. We're off to see the wizard. The wonderful wizard of Oz. Here is a hell of a
[3083.37s -> 3090.57s]  I don't know the lyrics. Ah, allow me to forewarn thee. I shall soon enter my slumber.
[3091.13s -> 3096.89s]  And it will be some time before I wake. This doll's body is not without its hindrances.
[3097.77s -> 3104.97s]  Still, I have high hopes for thee. I look forward to the good news when I what are we what are we
[3104.97s -> 3111.34s]  doing? I don't even know what the quest is. I shall soon enter and it will be what's what's the
[3111.34s -> 3128.76s]  quest? I hope I look for all she said is I'm gonna go to sleep. You're off to sell the treasure.
[3128.76s -> 3133.08s]  Right, right, right, right, right. All right. Here we go. It's time. We're gonna go explore.
[3134.04s -> 3142.55s]  I want to go see what is the deal. I want to see what the deal is at the tower because I want to
[3142.55s -> 3147.74s]  talk to they're all gone. But you know what I mean? Not fighting that dragon right now. We got
[3147.74s -> 3154.54s]  we got way bigger fish to fry. It's not a huge dragon. No, not even cool. Not even remotely
[3154.54s -> 3177.10s]  interesting. Let's go. Oh my god. I think I'm fine. I'm too excited. Fuck. We're off to see
[3177.10s -> 3202.12s]  the wizard. The wonderful wizard. What do we do now? I don't know. I'm not sure what we do now.
[3203.08s -> 3207.80s]  What do we do? What do we do? Okay. That it's hard to do that without the cringe. It is that the
[3207.80s -> 3214.33s]  lion is hard to do without absolute cringe. Do you understand how hard that is to do? Like it like
[3214.33s -> 3221.45s]  without everybody being like stop. Put a mob. Put a mob. What are you doing? Nobody can do that
[3221.45s -> 3225.93s]  without it. It has to be that bad actor like nobody else can. It's kind of like anybody
[3225.93s -> 3238.55s]  else doing that is cringing. You're the lion. No, I am not the lion. No, I would not be the lion.
[3239.27s -> 3244.89s]  And I would not be the mayor of munchkin land. Okay, so let's get that out of the way. I would
[3244.89s -> 3260.12s]  be the scarecrow. Get the fuck away from me. I would be the scarecrow. You know how I know
[3260.12s -> 3263.96s]  I'd be the scarecrow because the scarecrow does like little movements. He like goes like this and
[3263.96s -> 3269.16s]  like this and he like puts his hands like this and shit like that's me. That's me. I'm the scarecrow.
[3269.96s -> 3276.78s]  All right, there's this person. So here we go.
[3287.88s -> 3294.84s]  Cease to amaze. Okay. I suppose you're here now. Perhaps I'll give you something to do.
[3294.84s -> 3299.32s]  What do you do? I'd like you to find a woman called Nefeli to administer a potion.
[3300.12s -> 3306.44s]  Even you can do that much. Where are they? What do I do? I do it. I'll do it.
[3312.46s -> 3321.51s]  Okay, syllabus is potion. Find Nefeli and ensure she drinks it. Find Nefeli. I expect clad tidings
[3322.07s -> 3330.44s]  and soon. I have no time for idle shit. The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your
[3330.44s -> 3339.50s]  tasks completion. Are we understood? I have enough on it please. Oh, do you know what? Where are they?
[3339.50s -> 3344.04s]  I have no time. The only thing I have is I have enough. Does it say on the thing?
[3345.00s -> 3365.88s]  Where is it? What if I just like drink it in front of him? Where is it? It looks like a key item.
[3365.88s -> 3371.80s]  Oh, there it is. Small flask received from Perceptor Celvis containing a cloudy tonic
[3371.80s -> 3381.91s]  of bluish black. Find Nefeli and ensure she drinks it. I don't know where that person is.
[3382.47s -> 3405.96s]  I need to put it on my notepad. Okay. Sure. Maybe. But what if I don't? All right.
[3406.76s -> 3426.36s]  I don't confuse me. I'll just. It's the potion quest. Okay. Sounds good. What if it's poison?
[3426.36s -> 3430.04s]  I mean, it probably is poison and I'm gonna have to make a decision whether or not I want to keep
[3430.04s -> 3440.17s]  that person alive or not. All right. What if I just give him the potion? If I'm like, here,
[3440.17s -> 3454.54s]  how about a nice ice cold spray? Oh, thank you. Of course. And then I'll get his hat.
[3458.95s -> 3468.34s]  Ooh, good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Another spell slot. So what about,
[3468.34s -> 3475.66s]  can I go back in here though? Because now it's like, okay, maybe not. I could try. All right.
[3475.66s -> 3493.82s]  Mist. Where the mist is. The well in the mist would. Check it out. You wouldn't download a car.
[3496.02s -> 3502.34s]  No, I, you're right. I wouldn't. If I was a well, I would probably be like here somewhere.
[3504.90s -> 3511.40s]  There's a, that's a well. That is a well. Is it just, okay, down, is it just in Siofra?
[3511.96s -> 3530.55s]  Okay. How do I switch map to go down to? Okay. Let's do it. I need to like switch. Oh,
[3530.55s -> 3537.82s]  shit. All right. So where, where is he going to be? Just, I'll be down the well.
[3537.82s -> 3546.84s]  Just right in the front, front door. I'll be down the well. You'll find me by the well.
[3546.84s -> 3568.50s]  Right. Something like that. I don't think he's here. Riverbank. Maybe this is how to get here
[3568.50s -> 3578.23s]  with this, uh, with this fest this way. How can we read the most out of context messages?
[3583.54s -> 3586.98s]  We're just looking for him. He's going to be sitting somewhere in a weird spot.
[3587.86s -> 3615.82s]  His arms crossed. Just like sitting there. Frames. There he is. Frames. Right there. All right. I
[3615.82s -> 3627.54s]  found him. There you are. All right. Cool. He's really intimidating. Do you fight these guys?
[3627.54s -> 3630.26s]  What do you have to say about these guys that shoot the bow and arrows from across the whole
[3630.26s -> 3634.58s]  game? I mean, you, you could probably just kill them and you're going to kill them. Can I give,
[3634.58s -> 3642.62s]  will he die? All right. Fight them. Show me what you can do. Very intimidating. That's right. See
[3642.62s -> 3647.67s]  who I'm with. I'm with the guy that you don't want to fuck with and we're together and we're
[3647.67s -> 3652.28s]  coming to, we're, we're coming to the party together. Yeah. And that, and that's something.
[3653.16s -> 3667.35s]  And that's something. Yeah. Hey, I got this. Don't get up. Good to see you. Apologies, mate,
[3668.23s -> 3679.10s]  but I don't. I thought he killed me. I thought it was like a fucking scam. I thought it was a scam.
[3681.02s -> 3684.46s]  Like apologies. Like, sorry, mate. Like, boom, like arrow in the neck.
[3692.18s -> 3698.34s]  I missed that whole fucking thing. I just hear, oh, apologies, mate. Nothing to report so far. Boom.
[3698.34s -> 3703.64s]  Out. I fucking swear to God, I'm going to throw this guy. I'm going to just grab him by his legs
[3703.64s -> 3711.62s]  and just spin, spin, spin and throw him into a fucking bomb. I am trying to immerse myself
[3711.62s -> 3718.28s]  in the world. Leave me alone. And I don't care about your world immersion. I don't care about
[3718.28s -> 3723.08s]  your story arc. I care about that story arc of the big hairy guy. I don't give a shit about your
[3723.08s -> 3738.89s]  story. Can you repeat that whole thing? Because I missed everything. Damn it. Is he still going to
[3738.89s -> 3744.01s]  be there? Is he going to be there? Right? Is he still going to be there? He's still going to be
[3744.01s -> 3758.18s]  on the ledge. What if he's gone? It's because when you get on the horse, you move forward like,
[3759.30s -> 3768.74s]  okay, thank God you're still there. Please leave me alone. I don't want to aggro anything.
[3769.38s -> 3785.51s]  I already did, but whatever. Like I'll just kill them. Are you going to shoot an arrow from all
[3785.51s -> 3791.32s]  the way down there? You better not. Okay. He's shooting the arrow into a rocket. Just can we
[3791.32s -> 3811.37s]  walk this way? All right. I'll show you what I got. You're working with a saucer. Impressive.
[3812.73s -> 3817.77s]  Was that Loretta's grade bomb? I haven't seen that move in at least three or four years.
[3818.49s -> 3827.70s]  How did you come across such an incredible item? Well, well. I jest that far. Besides,
[3828.58s -> 3834.90s]  I should check on some things here. Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.
[3835.54s -> 3843.96s]  If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right. What was the first thing you told me?
[3843.96s -> 3849.42s]  Leave this place to me. And if we reach a dead end, I suppose we go back to the source.
[3849.42s -> 3852.54s]  Some of us rarely gives a straight answer the first time.
[3854.38s -> 3868.31s]  God damn it. I keep thinking you're betraying me. I swear to God. Stop. Okay. What was the first
[3868.31s -> 3874.23s]  thing he said? I was freaking out. He was like, let's go up there and beat that person up. He
[3874.23s -> 3882.38s]  mentioned about us beating somebody up. Where did what did he say? He's like, oh, we go beat
[3882.38s -> 3892.95s]  that person up. He said to go talk. He meant syllabus. He said you go talk to syllabus. Okay.
[3894.84s -> 3902.15s]  Okay. All right. Okay. Damn it, man. Go talk to the sorcerer. Come back.
[3902.95s -> 3908.81s]  I have a potion from the sorcerer. Squeeze the sorcerer, right?
[3908.81s -> 3929.14s]  All right. We have new dialogue with syllabus. The syllabus is this one down here. This is cool.
[3937.06s -> 3954.02s]  Oh, mind the dragon. Hey, what info do you have?
[3954.26s -> 3959.38s]  Time for idle chit chat. The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your tasks completion.
[3959.38s -> 3968.04s]  Are we understood? I haven't. You're asking me about that. Are you? The task was left to you and
[3968.04s -> 3974.92s]  the mongrel, was it not? Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot. Dead if you keep going here,
[3974.92s -> 3981.56s]  bud. Now's as good a time as any. I let you in on it. What's going on? A glint stone sorcerer by the
[3981.56s -> 3988.20s]  name of selling in the grave. She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from
[3988.20s -> 3993.80s]  the academy. Who's that? I asked her to look into the matter some time ago. I'll write you a letter
[3993.80s -> 4001.74s]  of introduction. Go ask. Is that the lady that I found in syllabus introduction? Okay. No time for
[4001.74s -> 4007.00s]  the only thing. Are we? And I haven't. Is that the lady, the burger queen? Yep. Okay. I gotta
[4007.00s -> 4017.58s]  remember where that was. Burger queen was where? Somewhere in one of these caves. Waypoint ruins?
[4018.22s -> 4023.50s]  It was really, really close to the start of the game. I think it's this one here. Waypoint ruins.
[4026.39s -> 4035.69s]  Am I still dropping frames? What the fuck? It's annoying. It shouldn't be doing that. Let me see.
[4045.42s -> 4057.72s]  It should even out. Why is it doing this? Yeah, I mean, I'm dropping frames on OBS,
[4059.19s -> 4062.79s]  but my internet connection's fine. I don't know. Maybe it's like my connection to the
[4062.79s -> 4071.22s]  um, it might be my connection to this, to Twitch servers. So because everything else seems perfectly
[4071.22s -> 4078.25s]  fine. It happens like every five to 10 minutes. Hmm. All right. Well, here we go. There you are,
[4079.05s -> 4086.79s]  my apprentice. Shall we commence the lesson? Son of us is not a name I ever wanted to hear again,
[4087.43s -> 4094.62s]  but fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge. Thank you. The stars alter
[4094.62s -> 4101.27s]  the fate of the Karyan royal family and the fate of your mistress Rani. Long ago,
[4101.27s -> 4108.33s]  General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations and in a crushing victory arrested their cycles.
[4108.33s -> 4115.21s]  Huh? Now he is the force that repulses the stars. If General Radahn were to die, the stars would
[4115.21s -> 4123.34s]  resume their movement and so too would Rani's destiny. Okay. Um, I'm going to hand you a piece
[4123.34s -> 4127.82s]  of paper and can you just write down a name and an X on where they are and then how,
[4128.70s -> 4142.68s]  you know what I mean? Like I don't, what does that mean? Ooh. All right. Ooh. Ooh.
[4145.14s -> 4156.07s]  That's new. Okay. So now we take that. We take that back to the source server guy or do I go
[4156.07s -> 4170.81s]  back to the wolf now? I think the wolf at this point. Yeah. Very cool. All right. So now we're
[4170.81s -> 4189.08s]  going to go talk to the wolf. You were here. This is crazy. Pepe laugh. Haha. Pepe laugh. All right.
[4189.08s -> 4194.47s]  Well, that's not good. He's the best boss in the game. New spell slot. You're exactly right,
[4194.47s -> 4229.93s]  but I can do it left here. What news? Oh shit. Don't kill him. I need him. I was seeing if he
[4229.93s -> 4236.49s]  would get angry. What if he just got hit in the head and died? Oh my God. That would be horrible.
[4236.49s -> 4241.37s]  I'm freaking out right now. Oh my fucking God. All right. I thought I actually fucked everything
[4241.37s -> 4247.37s]  up. I thought, I honestly thought I fucked up the whole game and I thought he was going to get
[4247.37s -> 4257.22s]  aggroed and like break his quest. Is this your first time playing? No, no. I beat every souls
[4257.22s -> 4261.22s]  game. I beat Sekiro on stream. Final boss in Sekiro, which is one of the hardest things I've
[4261.22s -> 4277.58s]  ever done. So don't worry. I'll get it eventually. He's still bragging about Sekiro. Yeah. I will
[4277.58s -> 4282.06s]  take that to the grave because I know people that abandoned, I know a shitload of people abandoned
[4282.06s -> 4288.06s]  Sekiro at the last like hour of the other game. I didn't. I beat it. I beat the last fucking guy.
[4288.06s -> 4291.18s]  And I know a bunch of people like, yeah, fuck that game. I'm not ever playing that ever again.
[4291.18s -> 4313.02s]  And I was like, yeah. And then I beat him. Do you guys have to seriously have an aggro range
[4313.02s -> 4322.58s]  that's this far? Just get out of here. Okay. We're good. What news? Here's the story. So Rani's
[4322.58s -> 4328.50s]  fate is kept in stasis by Starsgur's Radar. That reminds me of something I heard. What did you hear?
[4328.50s -> 4332.66s]  There's a festival being held at the castle on the southern edge of the Kaelid Wiles,
[4332.66s -> 4339.53s]  east of Limgrave. It's a festival of combat. And I heard that you can fight Radar himself.
[4340.92s -> 4346.20s]  He who's once called the strongest of all the Debbie gods. Maybe it's just a coincidence.
[4346.92s -> 4352.25s]  I think it's worth investigating. I'll be on my way to this festival of Radar.
[4352.25s -> 4359.54s]  Okay. In big F. I know. You're coming too, right? I'll meet you at Redmane Castle in
[4359.54s -> 4365.43s]  Kaelid. Redmane Castle in Kaelid. We fight sword and fire.
[4366.63s -> 4370.71s]  You understand like, why did this guy all do this? Why did he, he was de-aggroed.
[4371.83s -> 4388.94s]  These guys weren't even, it's been like, oh two minutes. Just get, you are way too level for
[4388.94s -> 4404.28s]  Radan. Oh, I still, Kaelid's all over there. I beat Radan. Okay. Well, at least I want to check,
[4404.28s -> 4414.50s]  maybe I'll check it out. Okay. So that is here. Probably up here somewhere. I haven't been over
[4414.50s -> 4424.42s]  here really at all. So I don't know. Maybe I, okay. I have that activated now. Maybe I continue to
[4424.42s -> 4430.66s]  trek this way. Cause there's still stuff apparently up here that I haven't done. Is it, it's visible
[4430.66s -> 4442.71s]  up on the map. Is it, it's not this over here. It's like the festival. Is it here? No, it's
[4442.71s -> 4450.63s]  probably there. I've been stuck on Radan for four days. Oh God, that's not encouraging.
[4451.43s -> 4477.35s]  That's it? Wait, it is this. It's this? Okay. What does this do? Where does this go?
[4477.91s -> 4498.14s]  Probably across the great bridge, right? I still, I'm just seeing what's here. It said impassable
[4498.14s -> 4508.07s]  bridge, but it's, it's, I can walk across it. I don't know what they mean. Why does it say that?
[4508.07s -> 4538.12s]  Is that going to take me just right to the, oh, I'm just here now. There's a tournament or
[4538.12s -> 4566.55s]  something going on. It's definitely right there in the halo theme song. Okay. Well I got this.
[4567.51s -> 4572.65s]  I kind of want to check out what's going on back there though. This festival. Yeah. Should I do
[4572.65s -> 4576.41s]  that? I kind of don't want to like have the frame rate. I don't want it like the internet to fuck
[4576.41s -> 4578.89s]  up in the middle of one of these fights, right? Cause then how am I supposed to prove if I beat
[4578.89s -> 4590.76s]  it? I'm kind of scared. Maybe I'll come back later. Is it actually a tournament arc?
[4599.90s -> 4600.40s]  What?
[4606.01s -> 4612.90s]  It's actually a tournament? This is insane. Do you, how many bosses do you fight?
[4633.64s -> 4634.60s]  Grab the great run.
[4635.32s -> 4641.85s]  Defeat the general in glory and great
[4641.85s -> 4652.97s]  and feel real bad for her. I've been practicing this new move to Loretta's great bow for anybody
[4652.97s -> 4657.37s]  that, you know, just in case somebody thought they were going to be at least even think they
[4657.37s -> 4664.62s]  could compete against me. And I mean, you know, I beat Loretta, killed Loretta mere hours ago,
[4664.62s -> 4667.90s]  got some pretty cool moves. You know, there's still time to back out of the tournament.
[4668.62s -> 4670.17s]  Fucking loser.
[4679.69s -> 4681.05s]  Fist of Alexander.
[4688.38s -> 4688.94s]  This is the pot.
[4710.20s -> 4712.44s]  Be sure to get a good vantage.
[4719.96s -> 4721.08s]  Look at that guy.
[4724.66s -> 4733.83s]  Oh, y'all should just go home. Okay. Who's that? Wait, what else do I have to say? This is crazy.
[4733.83s -> 4753.32s]  I like this. Get a good vantage. Okay. What about you? Do that. What do you have to say?
[4757.14s -> 4762.68s]  Then what's going on with your hand here? All right. All right. We've got to go through all these
[4762.68s -> 4769.29s]  clowns into the fray together. Let's see what you made into the fray together. So wait, is it,
[4769.29s -> 4775.29s]  it's like a tag team matches. Is it two V two? This is cool. Okay. I can't wait. This is actually
[4775.29s -> 4789.08s]  awesome. We're going to get two V twos into the fray together. Let's go. The prepared young chum,
[4789.80s -> 4798.15s]  the festival begin. Let's do it. I'm going to get my ass kicked. Wow. We begin.
[4798.95s -> 4821.46s]  Allow me to paint you the full picture. What? Long time ago. General Radon is cursed ever to wonder
[4824.95s -> 4832.50s]  inside by millennia scarlet rot. His wits are long gone.
[4833.30s -> 4847.30s]  Oh, now he gathers the corpses of former friends and foes alike, gorging on them like a dog
[4851.37s -> 4869.34s]  at the sky. But now we must make merry. Oh, gathering of champions. The rebels begin
[4870.22s -> 4872.54s]  the celebration of war.
[4876.38s -> 4881.82s]  I just started killing this guy next to me. Art and cry. Do I have to start fighting him?
[4881.82s -> 4884.86s]  Do I just start, do I backstab this guy? Is it everywhere for himself?
[4884.86s -> 4894.34s]  Past the church ahead on the shore. It's time to battle.
[4898.92s -> 4908.01s]  And howling at the sky. Okay. So he's through here. Oh, okay. So I get it. But wait, is there
[4908.01s -> 4914.90s]  anything else I can see? It might be something I can pick up. You guys are all on the same team.
[4914.90s -> 4919.78s]  What if I had backstabbed him? What would happen? Would I have just ruined this quest line?
[4922.34s -> 4929.58s]  Thank God I can actually upgrade this weapon now. It's been like six plus hours in game time.
[4930.30s -> 4943.27s]  Let me just check what's going on here. I don't want to just run out there,
[4943.75s -> 4959.69s]  but something in here. Anything? Yeah, there is smithing stone six. Nice. I don't think I've seen
[4959.69s -> 4975.03s]  one of those yet. What does this go? I was just trying to see what this does. Curious. Let's go
[4975.03s -> 4993.18s]  down road. Yeah. I'm going to upgrade my weapon. It goes down here. Okay. What is this?
[4994.30s -> 4999.51s]  Okay. Did I just like find something else? It's like a summoning thing here. There's definitely
[4999.51s -> 5025.13s]  a boss right here. I just like wandered away. Can I walk in this? I'm curious. What does this go?
[5029.99s -> 5036.58s]  Wait, I thought what happened to the tournament? I thought we were in a tournament. Star Scourge
[5036.58s -> 5050.79s]  for Dan. I thought we were in tournament together. What's all this shit? All right. I
[5050.79s -> 5059.34s]  got to get the timing down on this. I'm like confused. It's like travel so fast, but so slow
[5059.34s -> 5077.53s]  at the same time. Okay. Just don't drink. What is this shit on the ground? Oh shit. Let's go.
[5077.53s -> 5086.90s]  Wait, I can just bring everybody in here? I don't give a shit about the emote I just unlocked.
[5087.62s -> 5104.82s]  I don't care. Like put it in the fucking top left of the screen. You don't need to teach me
[5104.82s -> 5109.14s]  your dance move. Like when I press the button to... All right. I'm going to upgrade this shit.
[5109.86s -> 5118.63s]  Do I have enough to... I don't have enough souls to do it. I could probably sell some stuff. Yeah,
[5118.63s -> 5137.24s]  I will. Let me upgrade my weapon. That should be fun. Okay. If I summon each person and they
[5137.24s -> 5139.88s]  teach me a dance move, is that going to be annoying? Am I going to have to like hit,
[5139.88s -> 5142.44s]  like get it off the screen? Is that going to be annoying?
[5142.84s -> 5165.53s]  There you go. So let me get rid of some of this stuff. I know for a fact I'm not going to use...
[5167.10s -> 5184.41s]  I don't want to sell it though. I want this stuff. Okay. I have two of these. I don't want these
[5184.41s -> 5197.59s]  bug helmets. I'm not going to use them. I don't want to sell any of this. I need to sell something.
[5197.59s -> 5217.02s]  I'm going to sell some materials. Yeah. Oh, okay. Sell these. I don't need these. I need 800. Yeah.
[5217.10s -> 5227.16s]  Use this FP. Throw magic darts. What am I going to use those for? Okay. Here we go. This will get
[5227.16s -> 5234.95s]  this to plus five, which is way better than what it is right now. I need a somber smithing stone
[5234.95s -> 5250.79s]  six. All right. That looks good. Sick. Sick. Sick. Let me... I want to do like the actual tournament.
[5251.35s -> 5264.79s]  I don't want to just wander off to the beach and get killed. Look at me. He's purple.
[5264.79s -> 5276.86s]  I'm just... I don't know. Sometimes I turn purple. All right. Let's try it. All right. If I can't do
[5276.86s -> 5287.88s]  this... If I don't... If I'm not reliably going... Oh, I got this. That is the tournament. Oh,
[5288.36s -> 5295.96s]  what was this thing here with the... All right. Spell slot. I'm not going to use it against him.
[5296.68s -> 5301.32s]  I'm not going to use it for the boss anyways. It's okay. All right. I'm ready.
[5306.07s -> 5312.22s]  I'm ready. Do I have to do this every time? Is he going to have to tell me the story every time?
[5313.02s -> 5323.27s]  We don't. Okay. So I can... So what happens if I go through this? Does this just take you to that
[5323.27s -> 5333.26s]  area? What is like through this door? Or is this just blocked? Okay. So that's just blocked. Okay.
[5333.26s -> 5339.06s]  I don't know if you get to go through it or something. All right. Let's go. I'm going to
[5339.06s -> 5344.34s]  try it. I got to get that timing down. We... I got to... I got to dodge, summon, dodge, summon,
[5344.34s -> 5359.72s]  dodge, summon. Oh, right. Because there was that statue. You're right. Okay. What's this?
[5362.10s -> 5381.21s]  Anything here? All right. Let's go. Let's give it a try. The statue will be right here. All right.
[5381.21s -> 5395.96s]  Gaming begins. I don't think I'm going to use mana that much. We'll see. I really don't know.
[5397.11s -> 5408.17s]  But let's try it. Okay. It's time to fight this guy. All right. Dodge, summon, dodge,
[5408.17s -> 5454.78s]  summon. Let's go. Everybody. Everyone. There's more people? Oh, the jar. Oh, shit. Get in there.
[5460.12s -> 5468.84s]  All right. Get him. Get him. Get him. Summon Patches? Wait. Patches is here? Everybody's here.
[5470.58s -> 5482.66s]  Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in. Everybody get in. Oh, let me get the item. All right. Patches. Go.
[5483.38s -> 5502.95s]  It's like skin hanging off my mouth. Wait. Blade is dead. Why did Patches leave? Let's go.
[5517.45s -> 5527.24s]  Oh, shit. Everybody's dead. What is he? He's on a horse? He's on a horse. What the fuck?
[5528.98s -> 5566.78s]  Are you shitting me? That poor horse. Oh, nice. All right. Let's go. Oh, what the fuck?
[5568.60s -> 5583.19s]  I think that's a gravity move. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. I have no stamina. Did he drain my
[5583.19s -> 5603.10s]  stamina? Holy shit. Okay. You got to jump over that. I thought he was on wheels.
[5610.73s -> 5656.10s]  Burning through stamina here. I wonder why. Damn it, man. Oh, shit. I'm dead. It's over.
[5656.10s -> 5669.24s]  You can resummon people? Resummon in phase two? I was just eating through stamina unlike before.
[5669.80s -> 5689.82s]  I was just inhaling stamina. You can resummon indefinitely. I wonder if I should put more
[5689.82s -> 5698.71s]  mana on and just shoot him with a bow. He's stamina drains. Oh, that's what it is.
[5701.46s -> 5707.30s]  Can I just run through? How hard is it to dodge this on the horse? Okay. I'm fucking just roving
[5707.30s -> 5718.15s]  into it. Hold on a second. Let me get this down. Can I just go like this? Let me see. Hold on.
[5718.95s -> 5730.49s]  Yeah. Okay. I was testing to see if you could just run parallel to it. You cannot. Just kill me
[5730.49s -> 5737.46s]  because there's no reason to do this right now. I was seeing if you could just run like parallel,
[5737.46s -> 5740.90s]  all right? Perpendicular and not get hit by it, but he hits you with it no matter what.
[5742.15s -> 5749.43s]  Whatever. Say it. You know what I mean? The triangulation. Yeah. The sword ruins break one
[5749.43s -> 5758.04s]  hit. I think I got it. I think I got this. It's going to come down to just kind of running around
[5758.04s -> 5777.70s]  and being patient. Try Oleg. I got to be up a little closer, I think. Here we go. You, you,
[5778.34s -> 5806.50s]  you, you, you, you. Go, go, go, go, go. What the fuck are they doing? Why are they spinning around?
[5807.54s -> 5823.00s]  All right. Let's go. What happened? Hello? What happened? What happened? What's going on?
[5823.72s -> 5840.22s]  Where's my horse? What the fuck? Why did I die? What was that? Oh shit. That was dumb.
[5840.94s -> 5866.84s]  Was I falling? Oh shit. Okay. Well, whatever. All right. Get him again. So when you're saying
[5866.84s -> 5877.29s]  that when he, when the summons die, I can go. Jesus. So I can just run back and summon them all
[5877.29s -> 5906.39s]  again. I mean, that's, that's what we're doing. No. Everybody in. Everybody. Get on it. Get on.
[5906.39s -> 5918.14s]  Oh my God. I'm just like fucking spam. So those, those, those things follow you around.
[5918.14s -> 5923.10s]  Of course they do. So can I summon them on the horse? I wonder if I can just dodge that shit
[5923.10s -> 5937.61s]  and just run. See you guys in four days. No, no, no, no way. He has homing. I think I can,
[5937.61s -> 5943.10s]  I could try to avoid it. It's like getting off the horse and having that like one and a half seconds
[5943.10s -> 5947.74s]  of animation that you can't do anything with is what will get me killed if I get off the horse.
[5947.74s -> 5956.17s]  Let me see what happens if I do this. Like, can I, I'm just seeing if I can like dash like
[5956.17s -> 5967.35s]  right when it's there, right? We do it. It's a test run. That's run. So you physically cannot
[5967.35s -> 5974.17s]  avoid getting hit by that. Let's maybe jump over it. See, I didn't try dashing when it was right
[5974.17s -> 5986.87s]  there. I tried running. I'm going to try jumping. Let's try jumping. Yeah. That's a test run. Yeah.
[5986.87s -> 5989.91s]  I know I can use the scrap piles to block it. That's not what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned
[5989.91s -> 5994.15s]  about like needing to go all the fucking way over there. And when he does that stupid arrow homing
[5994.15s -> 6004.60s]  missile boom, let me see that happen. That ain't fucking happening. The dude literally has a homing
[6004.60s -> 6009.48s]  missile. It's like a 5,000 mile per hour homing missile. You can't do it. I just have to do what
[6009.48s -> 6039.35s]  I did before. Really? No shit. What happened? What? What? He, I got hit by like the spray.
[6040.15s -> 6050.42s]  Just run sideways. It, it, it still hits you. Even if you run sideways, you have to get lucky.
[6051.06s -> 6056.36s]  You're a bigger target on the horse. All right. So the play is to just run backwards and just let
[6056.36s -> 6064.17s]  them all run in. You have iframes while you summon the horse. How many though?
[6064.17s -> 6077.21s]  Hold on. Let's find out. Interesting. All right. Well, you don't have, you don't have iframes when
[6077.21s -> 6084.73s]  you get off the horse. How long do they last? Is it the whole time? It's actually really interesting.
[6084.73s -> 6090.54s]  Okay. No, you don't. Okay. You only have iframes when you get on the horse, not off.
[6091.34s -> 6096.78s]  I think I'm just going to have to do what I did last time. And that's just, I had just get on,
[6096.78s -> 6138.04s]  just do it on point. Let's do the stuff I think about. Oh, he's coming for me. All right. So you
[6138.04s -> 6169.34s]  said I can re-summon them now, but not yet. Spot's still alive. Okay. Oh, he's staggered,
[6169.34s -> 6175.24s]  but it's not going to help me. Don't do it. Okay. Here we go. So wait, I can summon them again.
[6176.28s -> 6201.67s]  I don't think I can. Nobody's there yet. I got to figure out like what a good time to go is.
[6202.47s -> 6209.96s]  Spot's still alive. Shit. I don't, I still don't know when to go.
[6212.10s -> 6221.75s]  Me, man. When I go in there, he just doesn't move. Are they not in the same place? I don't see any
[6221.75s -> 6236.63s]  summoning signs. Just have to be really careful and slow. This is one of those like 15 minute
[6236.63s -> 6242.65s]  boss encounters. I need to get to phase two. Okay. They come back for phase two. Okay.
[6242.65s -> 6263.96s]  Let's keep going with what I was doing. Like, please suck my ass.
[6266.28s -> 6356.42s]  You, you're not, what the fuck are you doing? Oh my God. Fuck off already. Good. Oh, fuck you.
[6356.42s -> 6362.66s]  Are you kidding me? Oh my God. What a hero. What a fucking hero. Who did that?
[6364.47s -> 6377.32s]  Who did that? I don't know who did that. Yes, should be the one on the right, not the left.
[6377.32s -> 6382.04s]  I shouldn't have to press left on the D pad. Of course I want to re-summon. Of course I want to
[6382.04s -> 6390.86s]  summon the fucking whores. What happened? There's meteors falling. Are we back? What's going on?
[6393.35s -> 6414.41s]  Where is he? Okay. There he is. Holy shit. Okay. I, what do those do? What do those things do?
[6414.41s -> 6425.21s]  What do the meatballs do? Do the meatballs fly out? What do the meatballs do? I don't, what do
[6425.21s -> 6453.37s]  the meatballs do? Bro, I don't fucking know. Are they going to shoot at me? Are you, are you fucking
[6453.37s -> 6465.62s]  kidding me? But they have a countdown timer of like two straight minutes. What? I'm sitting there
[6465.62s -> 6476.73s]  waiting for them to do anything and they just fucking sit there. Okay. Here's my play. Here's
[6476.73s -> 6496.81s]  the play. Uh, I'm going to put more mana potions in. Let's go. We're doing arrows. I don't want
[6496.81s -> 6501.59s]  to fight this guy normally. This is a very abnormal fight. This is a very weird fight.
[6505.61s -> 6508.81s]  I'm going to get on top of my horse and I'm going to fucking, I'm going to, I'm going to
[6508.81s -> 6520.41s]  meatball this guy. Cheese Andy. That's right. It's going to be a toasted fucking cheese sandwich
[6520.41s -> 6538.74s]  with a side of tomato soup. Before we begin, but now we, let's do it. It's time for some grade A
[6538.74s -> 6548.22s]  cheese. I cheese so hard. I didn't even have to hit him myself. I, you know, I really feel,
[6549.10s -> 6557.22s]  I really feel bad for the like 60 points in strength. Andy's was like, how the fuck do you
[6557.22s -> 6562.66s]  do this fight? This is probably so hard because you have to just get up in there and you've got
[6562.66s -> 6570.63s]  to get up in there. Oh man. I just spam summons and got the last hit to make myself feel better.
[6571.59s -> 6580.20s]  It's easy on strength. You just have to do a test. I wonder how much damage it does.
[6581.08s -> 6590.06s]  Do 600 damage per hit. Oh, that's like, that's good. All right. Should I bring out Oleg too?
[6590.06s -> 6593.42s]  I feel like that's too much mana. This is not the time. This is not the time for Oleg.
[6594.06s -> 6633.13s]  All right, here we go. Bullshit. Bullshit again. I, what? He didn't do that before.
[6634.09s -> 6642.36s]  What a dick. Oh my fucking God. I hate this fucking guy. He usually does the,
[6643.00s -> 6659.88s]  he does the fucking frame drop. The fuck? No, I don't want to like run like across the whole
[6659.88s -> 6665.72s]  game to fight the guy, to do a deal with his like trap shooting. Like, oh look, he's got like the
[6665.72s -> 6669.64s]  orcs must die trap that he shoots at you. I don't, I want to fight the guy.
[6670.60s -> 6711.13s]  Stop. What the fuck? All right. Get in there. Get in there. What are you waiting for?
[6712.33s -> 6718.41s]  Get in there and fight him. You guys are pissing me off. You guys are pissing me off. You're pissing
[6718.41s -> 6724.57s]  me off. Get in there. I'm a fucking raid leader. Yeah. Like what taking so long? Fucking get up
[6724.57s -> 6788.15s]  there and fight him. Get out the maiden. What are you doing? Get away from me. Go fight him.
[6788.15s -> 6812.49s]  He's literally in front of you. Where'd he go? Is he underground? Oh shit. No, dude. I'm so confused.
[6812.49s -> 6820.10s]  What is this person? I thought he was going to phase two. I don't, I'm so confused. I thought
[6820.10s -> 6828.76s]  he like went like away. He's a healer. I'm so fucking confused. I, oh my God. Okay. I'll get
[6828.76s -> 6836.95s]  him now. I'm going to get him. I'll get him. I'll get him now. Don't worry. Stupid ass encounter.
[6837.75s -> 6857.66s]  Watch the, I watched the clip after this. You guys, honestly, God, like I'm about to fucking scream.
[6858.54s -> 6871.11s]  Like just kill me already so I can start it again. I fucking, I fucking hate the fact that he's just
[6871.11s -> 6875.43s]  playing orcs must die. Like this is dark souls. Okay. This is an orc. I don't want to be an orc
[6875.43s -> 6879.27s]  and orcs must die. I just want to fucking go get them. I want to fight them. I want to fight this
[6879.27s -> 6885.51s]  guy. I don't want to, I don't want to get hit by like the spring trap. Like, oh, look out, watch out
[6886.15s -> 6907.45s]  the spikes that come out on the wall. I feel like he's playing tower defense and I'm like one of the
[6907.45s -> 6925.70s]  little shits. He didn't fucking do it. He usually does. You know what I'm saying. You know what I'm
[6925.70s -> 6943.21s]  fucking saying. And now I'm fucked. Fucking summon them. What the fuck? God, I hate this.
[6944.01s -> 6961.21s]  I like just summon them. Like I'm just running over them. Oh, I'm so mad right now. I didn't even
[6961.21s -> 6971.78s]  hit him. This is the guy that was in the E3 trailer. This is what you're going to do?
[6990.54s -> 6994.62s]  No, no, don't fight the fucking raid leader. Fight those, fight the other guys, fight the other people.
[6995.42s -> 7026.46s]  Ow. Oh shit. I just got really, really sloppy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[7026.46s -> 7042.90s]  don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't be an idiot. God damn it. I'm not locked on. I don't even know
[7042.90s -> 7070.50s]  who the fuck he is. This is fucking, this is dumb. Okay. What do you want me to do?
[7071.46s -> 7097.22s]  Look at the clip. What's the clip? Let me get it. This is fucking dumb. I hate this. All right, let's go
[7097.22s -> 7101.04s]  I'm so I hate this. All right. What are we watching? Let's go
[7115.13s -> 7118.23s]  I don't want to fight this guy. I want to fucking just leave
[7124.19s -> 7131.78s]  Fuckin hate this guy. I want all right. I'm beating him right now. I'm fine. So bad. It's unvoking believable
[7133.45s -> 7143.18s]  All right
[7143.18s -> 7145.66s]  That didn't even look real that looked like a fake picture
[7146.30s -> 7149.66s]  That looked like I put I pumped that in on purpose. I fuck all right
[7150.30s -> 7157.45s]  Stop shut up. Fuck you. I'm gonna beat him right now. This is the one I promised
[7158.09s -> 7166.14s]  All right, he did the stupid orcs must die move and now I gotta get on the
[7167.02s -> 7185.18s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry
[7185.18s -> 7187.34s]  No, dude, get on the fucking horse
[7190.57s -> 7194.33s]  Why are you still shooting at me? There are people in front of you. Do you not see?
[7263.08s -> 7292.68s]  Get in there, please
[7292.68s -> 7316.09s]  All right, let's go. I'm gonna summon some more people
[7316.65s -> 7322.22s]  There's a stone. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god
[7322.22s -> 7324.46s]  I thought he was back. I thought he was turned to face the other guy
[7325.34s -> 7332.63s]  I thought he was turning the other way because the guy was in front of him. I hate this encounter
[7334.06s -> 7335.98s]  Oh my god, I hate it
[7335.98s -> 7341.03s]  This is not even about dodging the guy
[7341.19s -> 7345.19s]  it's just throw up a bunch of fucking action figures to like this like
[7345.83s -> 7348.07s]  The school bully that comes and stomps on him
[7354.54s -> 7357.50s]  Oh my how do I throw a grenade down at the ground and die?
[7358.06s -> 7369.98s]  Just throw a grenade to the ground like because i'm like I just wasted a estus
[7387.22s -> 7390.90s]  Even with sorcery too. You were here very early. You can do the fun stuff
[7391.62s -> 7394.42s]  I'm beating this guy out of spite. I'm gonna win
[7395.06s -> 7398.84s]  This guy is such a piece of shit
[7399.64s -> 7401.64s]  I'm going to beat him out of spite
[7409.02s -> 7410.30s]  All right
[7410.30s -> 7417.72s]  If in 10 tries I do not do it. I'm going to leave and we'll come back later
[7418.52s -> 7428.38s]  10 tries 10 tries
[7464.57s -> 7466.57s]  Fuck you. Where are they?
[7467.42s -> 7469.42s]  Oh my god eat
[7469.42s -> 7473.02s]  Eat it seriously. God fucking damn it. Like I just don't
[7475.30s -> 7517.72s]  Like I fucking hate it
[7517.72s -> 7522.68s]  Oh my god, the fucking turning radius on this stupid ass horse. Like give me a fucking goddamn break
[7540.12s -> 7542.20s]  If you if you were on the ground, how would you avoid that?
[7563.45s -> 7567.80s]  dude like
[7567.80s -> 7590.17s]  Help me help my god. How the fuck are you dodging the house?
[7623.34s -> 7640.39s]  Dead I can't get out of this. I can't animation cancel anything. I'm stuck. How are you still alive lady?
[7640.79s -> 7656.60s]  Is lady still alive?
[7656.60s -> 7658.60s]  She's just running behind him
[7658.84s -> 7660.20s]  What the fuck?
[7660.20s -> 7678.60s]  All right. I got some of these guys
[7678.60s -> 7681.88s]  I can't take my thing off of them. I gotta like get it like here
[7682.52s -> 7692.34s]  Come on lionel get over here. All right, there's another couple that respawned over here
[7695.78s -> 7697.66s]  Christ
[7697.66s -> 7700.62s]  Where are they? I can't take the lock on off of them. I gotta just run around
[7701.18s -> 7716.47s]  It's like right here somewhere. All right, turn around and fight
[7738.63s -> 7741.91s]  All right. All right. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's fight fight fight fight fight. I need more summons
[7741.91s -> 7748.76s]  Where are they everybody back?
[7748.92s -> 7750.92s]  Fucking horse what?
[7751.24s -> 7753.24s]  Huh? What happened? What?
[7753.40s -> 7754.60s]  What?
[7754.60s -> 7759.00s]  What does he land there? Does he land there? What what does he land? He land on me?
[7759.24s -> 7760.92s]  Does he land on the top of the hill?
[7760.92s -> 7763.64s]  Was it the meteor was that him landing? I don't know
[7764.28s -> 7784.23s]  In meteor. All right, that's one
[7786.18s -> 7788.02s]  I just keep summoning people
[7788.02s -> 7791.62s]  Yeah, like the worst part about that though is you need to just ride around like a dickhead
[7792.42s -> 7797.86s]  And like sometimes it's hard to know where they're gonna spawn and turning and turning you back to try to look and see if you're
[7797.86s -> 7801.22s]  In the right direction. It's just you're just gonna get hit by a fucking one of these dumb things
[7801.94s -> 7808.97s]  I okay. I need to figure out what the solution is here
[7809.53s -> 7812.97s]  Because if I get on the horse and he does the fucking purple thing i'm fucked
[7814.17s -> 7817.05s]  Like can I just out? I don't think I can outrun this and I
[7817.85s -> 7819.90s]  It's so hard to tell
[7819.90s -> 7822.44s]  I think I can
[7822.44s -> 7831.91s]  Like everybody
[7831.99s -> 7838.33s]  I don't know you really really like are you fucking kidding me, dude?
[7857.34s -> 7858.70s]  Like everybody
[7858.70s -> 7867.21s]  I think there's the ladies up here, right?
[7867.61s -> 7870.68s]  I don't know. I can't there's I can't turn my back
[7871.08s -> 7914.04s]  Man, come on. Is there any more signs?
[7914.76s -> 7930.28s]  Just drive around
[7930.28s -> 7936.30s]  I don't see any more signs
[7936.62s -> 7938.62s]  I wonder if they just recently
[7940.62s -> 7963.72s]  Get them more more more people more people
[7964.86s -> 7971.66s]  Oh shit, I lost him
[7971.66s -> 7987.05s]  God damn it
[7987.05s -> 7988.89s]  i'm fucking dead
[7988.89s -> 8000.33s]  I don't I don't understand why that move is it is that in this it seems like how the fuck me what are you supposed to do?
[8001.69s -> 8005.39s]  Like what how do you fucking avoid that move? Is it even possible?
[8006.33s -> 8015.29s]  How big that fucking move is I can dodge roll it but i'm on the fucking horse
[8016.25s -> 8022.39s]  I'm so dead
[8022.39s -> 8041.34s]  All right up on the hill
[8041.34s -> 8046.06s]  We're running around doing that. Well, I mean I can't it's hard to close the gap if i'm gonna hit him and do like fucking
[8046.54s -> 8055.75s]  40 damage
[8056.55s -> 8064.58s]  That moves dumb
[8064.58s -> 8065.94s]  You all know it
[8073.43s -> 8074.63s]  That moves dumb
[8074.63s -> 8076.63s]  That's a dumb move
[8077.11s -> 8082.30s]  Let me just try to fight him
[8082.30s -> 8086.60s]  I'm gonna try to get up just to just to fight him either bleed or freeze
[8088.10s -> 8093.86s]  I feel like I can get him to at least phase two. I think the bow is takes way too long as as safe as you are
[8094.66s -> 8098.06s]  using the bow
[8098.06s -> 8101.02s]  Look at how long it takes. I mean, you don't need to see it, but it's just like one
[8101.66s -> 8102.62s]  two
[8102.62s -> 8103.66s]  three
[8103.66s -> 8108.30s]  Four five. It's like it's just you aren't you're in such a bad position. I'm just gonna fight him. I'm just gonna fucking fight
[8109.26s -> 8110.62s]  Let's go
[8110.62s -> 8113.42s]  I'm just gonna get in there and i'm gonna kick his ass
[8113.42s -> 8119.38s]  That's it. I'm just gonna go i'm gonna go kick the shit out of him face to face one on one
[8120.10s -> 8122.10s]  With a bunch of friends and then that's it
[8123.14s -> 8136.01s]  Can I outrun this?
[8136.01s -> 8141.40s]  Because getting on the horse is like such a bad idea right here because he'll do the purple shot
[8142.20s -> 8147.13s]  I can outrun it. All right, I don't need to get on the horse
[8148.25s -> 8149.13s]  Really?
[8149.13s -> 8161.69s]  You buddy let's go
[8161.69s -> 8164.17s]  Let's all get in there and fight him as one as a team
[8180.87s -> 8183.19s]  There's too much going on too many people
[8184.15s -> 8186.39s]  Way too many bodies
[8186.39s -> 8190.47s]  Uh, it's hard so many sound effects. It's almost I can't tell who's even doing move
[8191.03s -> 8196.98s]  You're supposed to get on the horse
[8196.98s -> 8204.84s]  All right. How many attempts is that before I just like never come back to this shitty piece of fucking garbage fight ever again
[8208.62s -> 8230.66s]  three, okay, just gotta do this seven more fucking times I
[8233.99s -> 8235.59s]  Fucking hate this
[8235.59s -> 8237.59s]  Just kill me like a what?
[8239.75s -> 8246.09s]  Somebody said this took them four days to do what the fuck
[8252.98s -> 8255.22s]  No, that counts that counts that counts
[8263.96s -> 8267.56s]  I'll summon oleg. I'm gonna summon oleg and let him get one hit killed
[8268.12s -> 8282.06s]  Dude, honestly, I think i'm gonna fight this boss without the hut too, by the way
[8282.71s -> 8285.91s]  You know what I mean? Like i'm just gonna turn the hut off because like what's all this info on the screen?
[8285.91s -> 8325.66s]  I don't want to fucking see it
[8326.04s -> 8338.07s]  47 fucking damage
[8338.49s -> 8357.70s]  Dude, will you stop fucking swinging? Oh my god
[8365.51s -> 8387.46s]  Is this like a fucking movie i'm watching or do I get to fight the guy oleg get out here
[8389.66s -> 8393.42s]  Get to be off the horse. How come I can't summon what?
[8394.06s -> 8399.67s]  Why not? I can't summon
[8400.07s -> 8407.38s]  I can't summon them here
[8407.38s -> 8409.46s]  Everyone yelling at me to summon oleg. I can't
[8414.49s -> 8417.08s]  I got a better idea
[8417.08s -> 8418.76s]  All right
[8418.76s -> 8420.20s]  new plan
[8420.20s -> 8422.20s]  New plan for the last five attempts
[8423.22s -> 8430.39s]  My hand goes through my monitor
[8430.47s -> 8432.52s]  new plan
[8432.52s -> 8433.40s]  uh
[8433.40s -> 8439.58s]  Do I have
[8439.58s -> 8443.74s]  I this is not gonna this is not gonna cut it. This might though. Hold on
[8446.09s -> 8448.09s]  Maybe I should just sit there and just like
[8450.82s -> 8454.10s]  These things happen quick swift ones
[8455.06s -> 8470.01s]  I don't think anything else is worth doing. I'm honest. I think I just eat
[8470.65s -> 8473.93s]  I think I just have yeah, I mean i'm gonna get i'm gonna lose but
[8474.65s -> 8488.25s]  I'm just gonna be an absolute coward and we're just gonna swift glintstone fucking run around and just pick them
[8492.54s -> 8496.54s]  Yeah, I I only have one sacred tier on these flasks, which is really awful
[8497.70s -> 8499.70s]  If I can't get it, i'm just i'm not ready for it
[8501.30s -> 8505.30s]  Activate rune arcs. Yeah, but if I die with a rune arc, isn't that just gonna delete the rune arc?
[8505.30s -> 8508.98s]  Wow, I wouldn't want to use that at a boss. I'm not comfortable getting 50% of his health down
[8514.87s -> 8516.87s]  Anything besides the bow is probably too short range
[8518.81s -> 8522.33s]  I'll try it. It's just a humanity
[8523.46s -> 8526.34s]  I cannot use my summons, but they're not allowed in that area
[8527.34s -> 8531.26s]  I can summon the people on the ground but the hardest part for me so far has been
[8531.98s -> 8533.50s]  All right, you summon everybody
[8533.50s -> 8536.70s]  You do the orcs must die bullshit in the first fucking minute and a half of the fight
[8537.34s -> 8541.58s]  I'm getting on my horse and like I gotta like go around and touch the summoning signs
[8541.58s -> 8544.52s]  But sometimes I'll lose the walk-on
[8544.52s -> 8546.84s]  And then I then he just I can't even fucking see him
[8548.36s -> 8550.98s]  All right
[8550.98s -> 8555.14s]  I'm gonna just be a wuss and we're gonna swift glintstone them over and over again
[8558.90s -> 8566.70s]  In fact, i'm gonna put the sword away. I'm not gonna use it. I was gonna hold this in two hands
[8571.80s -> 8573.80s]  Go take a csgo
[8574.12s -> 8580.92s]  Break
[8580.92s -> 8585.64s]  All right. I got five more attempts before i'm turning around and running away from this bullshit
[8587.93s -> 8589.93s]  The festival is nigh
[8590.81s -> 8594.49s]  I'm just gonna stay the fuck away from and just be very very cautious
[8595.90s -> 8598.41s]  Before we begin
[8598.41s -> 8600.41s]  I only have two heels though, which is bad
[8609.53s -> 8624.97s]  I don't need to talk to him. Oh, okay. It's good to know use the buffs bow and spam the bow
[8625.85s -> 8630.50s]  I I have to stand in the circle, which that's like just guaranteed to die
[8631.22s -> 8635.38s]  I have to stand inside of that little buff circle. It doesn't it's not it doesn't stay on me
[8647.91s -> 8651.03s]  I know i'm not supposed to be doing this. I'm not i'm under leveled. I know
[8651.99s -> 8656.39s]  I'm under geared. I'm coming in here at the wrong time. I know
[8663.30s -> 8665.30s]  I know i'm missing flasks. I know
[8666.26s -> 8668.89s]  What it's called being a stubborn little shit
[8692.20s -> 8693.56s]  Get out of the way
[8693.56s -> 8705.85s]  Eat my ass. I'm serious
[8727.67s -> 8730.95s]  I'm not even fucking kidding. Yeah, it's not it's bow. It's bow or nothing
[8740.26s -> 8742.26s]  Do it very slowly
[8746.12s -> 8747.64s]  slow
[8747.64s -> 8749.64s]  It's gonna find the other summoning sign right here
[8750.36s -> 8755.48s]  I don't know if I got it or not. It's so fucking hard to tell
[8759.91s -> 8761.80s]  Where is he?
[8761.80s -> 8764.44s]  I don't know what the fuck out god god god god god god
[8803.53s -> 8807.13s]  What the fuck dude, what are you curving around his fucking body?
[8807.85s -> 8841.53s]  What was that?
[8841.53s -> 8842.65s]  Damn it
[8842.65s -> 8871.75s]  Just the opportunity is so small to hurt him. I just have to run around and just don't even attack him
[8872.86s -> 8877.10s]  Just get the shots that I can get off and then half the summons hurt him. They keep spawning. I guess
[8878.46s -> 8893.61s]  I don't fucking know
[8893.61s -> 8903.56s]  Any more summons?
[8903.56s -> 8905.72s]  We're doing coward play right here. I don't care
[8906.36s -> 8919.74s]  It's real coward gameplay right now
[8922.54s -> 8931.43s]  I have no shame
[8931.43s -> 8935.11s]  Oh my god. I thought he was aiming the out way. I didn't think it was gonna come this way
[8935.91s -> 8950.57s]  All right more summoning symbols. Where are they?
[8951.21s -> 8969.05s]  Thought I saw one over here. No, fuck off. It's three people next to you dude. Get out of here
[8994.17s -> 9016.81s]  Summoning signs
[9016.81s -> 9018.81s]  Oh shit
[9039.11s -> 9048.73s]  Where is everybody
[9048.73s -> 9050.89s]  Why he baited me he fucking actually baited me
[9052.79s -> 9054.79s]  That was actual bait right there
[9055.19s -> 9058.55s]  Okay, watch over the meteor meteor meteor meteor watch over the meteor. Where's the meteor?
[9059.35s -> 9061.61s]  Where is it?
[9061.61s -> 9062.97s]  Where's the meteor?
[9062.97s -> 9087.54s]  Oh my god
[9087.54s -> 9090.90s]  I'm so scared. I don't want to go close to him. This is for the meatballs
[9096.02s -> 9103.58s]  You know, i'm terrified
[9103.58s -> 9106.46s]  I'm gonna shoot the bow and the meatballs gonna kill me
[9113.77s -> 9115.77s]  What the fuck you?
[9128.07s -> 9129.83s]  What killed the wolf?
[9129.83s -> 9132.14s]  Why did the both die?
[9133.18s -> 9135.61s]  Get on a horse
[9135.61s -> 9139.13s]  Dude, I fucking can't with that goddamn move
[9142.31s -> 9143.35s]  I was
[9143.35s -> 9154.63s]  Slow and steady if you're on you can't you're just gonna just do that fucking move and pull you in
[9155.59s -> 9169.98s]  Don't use the horse. Do you you understand how fast i'm gonna fucking die if I don't use the horse?
[9172.50s -> 9178.02s]  I I I have fucking 25 points in dexterity. I'm in trouble if I get off that fucking horse
[9178.98s -> 9194.54s]  The only way that I can do that off the horse is if I just just try to just learn all of it
[9194.54s -> 9196.54s]  But that's gonna be fucking impossible
[9197.02s -> 9201.54s]  I wonder how many people beat this off the horse. I feel like it's like you're not supposed to
[9202.90s -> 9207.30s]  Because he's on a horse and we've already seen if somebody's on a horse get on a horse
[9208.26s -> 9214.92s]  I just like
[9215.48s -> 9219.64s]  I freaked out. I fucking freaked out
[9243.11s -> 9245.27s]  You've got five people around you
[9245.99s -> 9306.54s]  All right summon fuck that's worked every other time just running sprinting
[9308.46s -> 9315.11s]  All right, how many is that how many is that I usually sprint diagonally and I don't get hit
[9317.40s -> 9320.60s]  I'm i'm gonna cut it short. I don't think I can do it without more upgrades
[9323.64s -> 9325.64s]  I don't think I can I don't think I can do without upgrades
[9326.52s -> 9328.76s]  I need at least like a plus three flask
[9329.48s -> 9330.44s]  and
[9330.44s -> 9334.41s]  I just want to fucking throw a grenade at this guy
[9338.38s -> 9343.74s]  I have a plus one flask. What am I my fucking idiot? Like I have to drink like six extra potions
[9344.62s -> 9376.95s]  Still don't understand that move. I just don't get it
[9378.82s -> 9381.62s]  It's it's that you can't avoid it on foot and if you get on the horse
[9381.94s -> 9384.90s]  You might get fucking hit by the purple thing if you get off the horse again
[9388.86s -> 9392.54s]  I can't dodge through it because it goes behind me. I don't I don't understand that
[9393.91s -> 9394.15s]  All right
[9394.15s -> 9396.15s]  So when I get on the horse if he does that move
[9396.63s -> 9401.59s]  And I outrun it with the horse and he does the purple charge beam as I he's gonna hit me with it
[9401.83s -> 9405.11s]  He's gonna fucking hit me with it. What what the fuck were they thinking?
[9512.74s -> 9516.34s]  I don't have a fucking regular ass weapon out. What are you thinking bro? What are you doing?
[9516.42s -> 9518.42s]  I don't have a fucking regular weapon out
[9543.75s -> 9561.40s]  Don't lose lock on
[9561.40s -> 9563.72s]  I don't know why I keep i'm freaking out about that one now
[9564.68s -> 9579.70s]  All right summon there's a couple up here
[9580.26s -> 9583.56s]  At least it should be right
[9583.56s -> 9597.70s]  No
[9597.70s -> 9599.38s]  Where is it?
[9599.38s -> 9603.77s]  It's back here somewhere
[9603.77s -> 9617.85s]  Where are they over there?
[9618.81s -> 9633.14s]  Fuck you. Fuck you. I can't avoid that. I have to get hit by it every time
[9634.02s -> 9648.89s]  Dude, no god damn it the fucking turning radius. Oh my god. I hate this fucking thing
[9648.97s -> 9662.15s]  I hate if you could even call it that if you could even call it that I like I turned but the horse went like
[9662.87s -> 9664.07s]  like
[9664.07s -> 9689.80s]  That way that one was going pretty well too. It's just you get like if you get like caught a tenth of a second
[9691.08s -> 9694.36s]  I just don't I don't I don't want to be a fucking mile away from a goddamn boss like fucking
[9695.80s -> 9704.34s]  See what I mean? He didn't do the fucking thing. He didn't do the thing. He did the purple shit instead
[9704.98s -> 9706.98s]  And he did the purple shit again
[9709.34s -> 9714.90s]  And now he's gonna do the I hate him. I fucking hate him. This guy gets a cap
[9715.46s -> 9731.74s]  Somebody invading the game. Why is there a red guy?
[9732.46s -> 9800.39s]  All right, right there back there
[9810.07s -> 9817.77s]  Get it. That is such a dog shit fucking
[9818.09s -> 9845.99s]  I tried to jump at the right time
[9846.63s -> 9855.61s]  You're running to you're running circles around him instead of running away
[9855.61s -> 9859.61s]  But if I run away I lose the lock on and I like turn that way and fucking sucks
[9860.57s -> 9889.61s]  Oh, that's
[9904.44s -> 9906.76s]  And he's also faster than me too. That's another thing
[9908.30s -> 9910.78s]  He pursues me. He's gonna close the gap because he's faster
[9911.50s -> 9933.13s]  Where are those summoning things over there?
[9933.61s -> 9935.78s]  Fuck you
[9936.50s -> 9980.79s]  This boss is from knack three they should have kept him there. I don't know summoning signs back behind me. I think
[9982.49s -> 9989.91s]  I'm not gonna beat him one. I'm gonna back. I'm gonna go here
[9990.39s -> 9997.24s]  It's a really stupid idea. But whatever
[10002.23s -> 10003.27s]  I don't know
[10003.27s -> 10010.65s]  I don't see me. Oh my goodness. This is bad. What the fuck did you come from? Well do something. What? Hey
[10011.45s -> 10018.41s]  What was that?
[10018.41s -> 10022.33s]  All right, I give up. I give up this guy sucks. I'll be back later

[10418.23s -> 10420.23s]  Why am I dropping so many frames?
[10420.47s -> 10425.43s]  I have I have fucking gigabit thousand thousand internet connection. What is going on?
[10426.23s -> 10430.78s]  This is like my internet connection can't get better than this
[10431.34s -> 10445.74s]  Like I physically can't get a better connection
[10446.38s -> 10448.74s]  Look at how sweaty I am. Holy shit
[10450.58s -> 10453.22s]  Why do you look like this because i'm deranged right now. Okay

[10471.70s -> 10474.12s]  That's something I can do
[10474.12s -> 10475.40s]  That sounds like fun
[10475.40s -> 10490.01s]  Because I I know I can kill the dragon. It's been a while
[10490.73s -> 10524.92s]  We do a brb. Uh, if I don't beat the dragon in three tries, I will be Rebecca. Oh my god. That's the vendor
[10525.24s -> 10529.00s]  Oh my god, that's the vendor. I just was like mad. So I just attacked a guy
[10530.12s -> 10532.12s]  No, don't kill the vendor, please
[10537.88s -> 10540.20s]  Okay, geez, I don't want to kill the vendor
[10540.68s -> 10552.57s]  It's been an age since I was custom. What do you got two imps
[10554.20s -> 10556.20s]  Crafting. Oh shit. All right
[10556.76s -> 10558.20s]  You got some good shit
[10558.20s -> 10561.34s]  There's a note here
[10561.34s -> 10566.54s]  Have a safe journey. I'm gonna mark this because that's actually pretty good. All right, i'm gonna mark this
[10569.67s -> 10572.07s]  Uh, like a vendor what would be vendor probably this
[10580.23s -> 10584.09s]  Next time you fight that boss, don't use the party finder. It's full of morons
[10588.94s -> 10595.21s]  Stop is it safe for me to drop down from here or i'm gonna die
[10597.94s -> 10607.58s]  Finder what's this? What's going on? What are you? What's this guy doing here?
[10612.89s -> 10617.42s]  All right, I gotta like get I gotta play dark souls again i've been literally riding around
[10618.06s -> 10620.06s]  Playing anti-tower defense the whole game
[10620.46s -> 10628.01s]  Like i've been on the horse for three hours trying to fight this stupid fucking random ass encounter
[10628.49s -> 10645.77s]  Jesus christ, dude
[10646.01s -> 10665.72s]  What the fuck?
[10665.72s -> 10668.20s]  Who the fuck is this guy? What are you doing over here?
[10669.00s -> 10673.48s]  What the oh is happening?
[10673.74s -> 10677.54s]  Who's this guy?
[10677.54s -> 10679.54s]  Get away from me. I'm trying to play
[10687.65s -> 10693.19s]  Celestial dude
[10693.19s -> 10695.67s]  carry out absolution at the church of vows
[10697.88s -> 10699.38s]  reversing all
[10699.38s -> 10700.84s]  antagonizations
[10700.84s -> 10710.57s]  Is this so I bring that to the turtle and I can reverse people that are angry
[10711.29s -> 10720.63s]  interesting
[10720.63s -> 10724.39s]  Okay, that's weird. It makes npcs not mad at you. Ah, all right
[10725.27s -> 10727.27s]  Uh, okay. I need to go
[10730.25s -> 10732.25s]  No, what's the fastest way to get there?
[10732.25s -> 10733.69s]  I think it probably
[10733.69s -> 10742.73s]  You still have plus a one flask. I know but like I don't
[10743.29s -> 10745.37s]  This world is so huge that it's like
[10746.70s -> 10748.70s]  I need to I don't know what they are
[10748.86s -> 10752.70s]  I think they're like churches, but like I need to where is it? I need to find a church
[10757.53s -> 10765.54s]  I'll get it soon. Don't worry. I feel like i've come across random churches. Maybe would they be on the map?
[10766.34s -> 10768.90s]  like that right
[10768.90s -> 10772.18s]  So like in here like but I feel like i've gotten that one already
[10774.90s -> 10776.90s]  Did I get this this is a church?
[10777.06s -> 10780.79s]  technically
[10780.79s -> 10782.79s]  No dragon. No, no, i'm going for the dragon right now
[10783.35s -> 10786.10s]  I just want to get a better uh place to do it
[10786.74s -> 10793.16s]  So if we go I gotta go this can I jump over this?
[10793.96s -> 10799.11s]  What's the best actual way to go to get here from probably one of these this one?
[10799.99s -> 10801.51s]  That's a cave
[10801.51s -> 10804.33s]  this one here
[10804.33s -> 10808.52s]  Because I can jump i'm trying to just not die because you die from the fall damage there
[10811.48s -> 10816.97s]  Yeah, it's this one here. Yeah. All right. Let me go kill this dragon. Let me try to
[10817.69s -> 10841.74s]  See if i'm gonna do it
[10841.74s -> 10844.86s]  Frames are still dropping. I I have no idea what's going on
[10847.22s -> 10848.98s]  That should not be happening
[10848.98s -> 10850.98s]  But it apparently is
[10851.06s -> 10854.90s]  I don't know if it's twitch server problem or I don't know if it's a connection my connection problem
[10855.94s -> 10857.38s]  but
[10857.38s -> 10859.75s]  I don't know it's weird
[10859.75s -> 10862.68s]  I'm gonna start connecting to a different twitch server
[10863.08s -> 10867.32s]  I feel like the one i'm connecting to is like a piece of shit. So i'm gonna connect something else
[10868.97s -> 10872.01s]  Next stream I will connect to a different ingest server
[10872.81s -> 10874.81s]  I feel like that's part of the problem
[10875.05s -> 10930.25s]  Okay, let me see if I can kill him. Here we go. Do it. What was that?
[10930.97s -> 10981.90s]  Is he gonna use me?
[10981.90s -> 10988.30s]  I don't like this place, but I don't like fighting him here
[10988.94s -> 11009.85s]  I don't want to fight him against the wall
[11013.77s -> 11017.16s]  Thank you for moving I appreciate
[11017.16s -> 11042.46s]  What are you doing?
[11042.46s -> 11043.90s]  What are you doing?
[11043.90s -> 11045.59s]  What's he doing?
[11045.59s -> 11053.66s]  What are you doing?
[11053.66s -> 11055.66s]  Being a weirdo. What are you doing?
[11055.66s -> 11058.01s]  Why are you being such a weirdo?
[11058.01s -> 11109.96s]  What are you doing?
[11109.96s -> 11118.41s]  Not against the wall get out of there
[11181.35s -> 11232.86s]  Watch out for the giant slug. Where'd he go? I'm not gonna fight a giant slug right now. Hey
[11233.50s -> 11248.65s]  All right. I'm good. Oh
[11248.73s -> 11284.31s]  Shit, I jumped. I didn't I jumped twice. What happened? He killed me in one hit
[11284.95s -> 11287.26s]  What happened what

[11292.06s -> 11293.02s]  What?
[11293.02s -> 11295.02s]  I died in one hit
[11296.65s -> 11299.18s]  What?
[11299.18s -> 11301.18s]  That's no
[11301.18s -> 11302.98s]  No
[11302.98s -> 11306.87s]  No
[11306.87s -> 11310.95s]  He landed he landed but I like jumped and he landed I touched his like
[11311.75s -> 11312.95s]  Buddy
[11312.95s -> 11316.15s]  That was so sad one hit
[11318.01s -> 11322.09s]  Oh my god, i'm so defeated right now like what the
[11322.65s -> 11324.17s]  fuck
[11324.17s -> 11326.86s]  What?
[11341.19s -> 11346.39s]  I guess i'm gonna just somebody said be aggressive. Yeah, I was trying to be slow and smart
[11348.95s -> 11353.27s]  But fuck man if I can die in one hit am I like not supposed to be fighting this guy either
[11356.50s -> 11359.58s]  Go
[11360.55s -> 11362.98s]  How is what's going on
[11362.98s -> 11365.54s]  I've landed on this rock fucking a hundred times
[11366.18s -> 11367.14s]  What?
[11367.22s -> 11378.98s]  That doesn't count i've jumped on that rock three five thousand times in a row
[11379.70s -> 11381.70s]  What what the fuck is going on?
[11382.26s -> 11384.26s]  Where did you just put me?
[11384.50s -> 11390.15s]  No, it doesn't count. Jeremy, you are so stressed. Take a break
[11392.58s -> 11394.58s]  That was so that was horse shit
[11396.30s -> 11398.30s]  Why did I die in one hit?
[11400.92s -> 11405.40s]  I feel like i've gotten hit by that move. Okay. So tell me what the fuck is going on right now because literally i've
[11405.72s -> 11407.48s]  Is it the double jump?
[11407.48s -> 11410.74s]  I guess I
[11411.16s -> 11413.56s]  I'm just gonna be super aggressive and if it gets me killed whatever
[11417.53s -> 11419.53s]  Go directly south of the dragon
[11423.21s -> 11440.68s]  Right here. I want to see look. All right. I understand that you want to shoot a whole map full of fucking magic
[11440.68s -> 11442.84s]  But like look, can I please see my fucking map?
[11443.80s -> 11476.30s]  Thank god. I don't even fucking think about it. You're pushing my buttons right now
[11488.42s -> 11491.62s]  A little there's a little island here. I just you said there's one here
[11492.58s -> 11494.18s]  All right, save me
[11494.18s -> 11519.66s]  Did I beat the dragon? No, he killed me in one hit
[11520.30s -> 11528.52s]  I have full health which leads me to believe that I either got like omega stomped
[11529.08s -> 11532.39s]  Or I like wasn't i'm still not supposed to fight that guy
[11534.78s -> 11540.49s]  All right. Well, you said go to the island. What's on the island? I mean, it's lily

[11550.82s -> 11555.75s]  Far out of the cell. You mean like you mean like all the way down here
[11556.39s -> 11564.09s]  Like way south i'm gonna go all the way down there
[11566.22s -> 11572.33s]  Okay, this is crazy. This is a whole nother content
[11573.29s -> 11582.49s]  Go this way
[11582.49s -> 11585.87s]  I thought this was like the end of the world. There's another way to go. That's fucking ridiculous
[11598.71s -> 11601.35s]  What's back here? I feel like i've done this part
[11602.39s -> 11606.74s]  Let me just check
[11606.98s -> 11608.98s]  Starlight shards
[11626.33s -> 11633.24s]  All right. So the what am I looking for down here? Is it gonna kill me?
[11634.49s -> 11640.31s]  I'm not okay
[11640.31s -> 11642.55s]  Southern island is is is pretty easy

[11649.51s -> 11651.51s]  That's making me want to fucking
[11651.51s -> 11653.51s]  Smash my webcam into 100 pieces
[11656.98s -> 11658.10s]  Oh, okay
[11658.10s -> 11678.46s]  All right. I can still be on the horse
[11678.97s -> 11680.97s]  I'm gonna get to one of those, uh gray states
[11712.57s -> 11714.57s]  All right, give me a bonfire so I can take a quick break
[11717.83s -> 11721.19s]  Smashing my fucking head against a wall fighting a boss i'm not supposed to be fighting
[11722.33s -> 11723.69s]  who has
[11723.69s -> 11725.61s]  a shit
[11725.61s -> 11731.85s]  Shit encounter i'm gonna go down here and i'm gonna have a great time

[12148.92s -> 12173.27s]  Let's go for it. Hello. How are you? So where where am I?
[12175.51s -> 12183.90s]  bridge of sacrifice
[12183.90s -> 12190.46s]  shito, okay

[12204.14s -> 12214.78s]  Or I gotta get all these markers. Is that how can I can I just clear all the markers that I have?
[12215.42s -> 12217.34s]  I I feel like this should be a fast way to do this
[12217.98s -> 12224.86s]  And I just like because if i'm gonna be down here
[12225.42s -> 12231.22s]  I don't want these on the map. Okay
[12233.14s -> 12234.10s]  uh
[12234.10s -> 12239.26s]  this way
[12239.26s -> 12259.77s]  Back in a new npc. Hello. Is somebody there? Might I bend your ear for a moment, please? My name is arena
[12260.49s -> 12262.49s]  I've escaped from castle
[12262.73s -> 12265.37s]  No, that's uh, that's laniya have rebelled
[12265.93s -> 12268.74s]  I can't be sure what it is
[12269.14s -> 12274.90s]  My eyesight's been weak since birth, you see but I swear I heard frightful howling from all over
[12275.38s -> 12279.78s]  My good father secreted me out the castle but decided himself to stay
[12281.06s -> 12283.06s]  He says it's his duty
[12283.54s -> 12289.54s]  As commander red nose, you can just see like that. Is it all the anger is hanging out right now? It's like here
[12291.05s -> 12293.05s]  I look like i'm fucking trashed
[12294.26s -> 12300.73s]  I look shit-faced. I look like i've had like seven beers today like I look trashed
[12301.37s -> 12308.44s]  The servants are full of wrath. They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with
[12309.16s -> 12311.00s]  They haven't spared a soul
[12311.00s -> 12317.32s]  I fear it's no different at castle morning. Please don't mind taking a letter to my father and my soul wishes that he escaped

[13552.97s -> 13556.41s]  And i'm just trying to wave to him. I don't know. Nobody seems to be like trying to communicate
[13557.29s -> 13560.92s]  Get it
[13560.92s -> 13562.92s]  They keep walking like kind of forward
[13562.92s -> 13567.64s]  And like maybe I hit them in like the face sometimes accidentally if it's not my fault. Like i'm just trying to say hi
[13571.78s -> 13574.41s]  Fucking wave at that guy

[13649.91s -> 13651.51s]  Like all of them could be
[13651.51s -> 13655.02s]  This is coping mechanism for me not to get mad. Don't you understand?

[13726.54s -> 13732.06s]  Can you imagine him just you're just walking around outside and there was just this thing that was just moving slowly forward with his mouth open
[13732.94s -> 13734.54s]  be like
[13734.54s -> 13736.14s]  We're just we're just dead

[13741.13s -> 13744.65s]  We're so lucky that spiders are as big as they are imagine spiders were as big as a house
[13747.08s -> 13748.52s]  Well, okay
[13748.52s -> 13765.80s]  But what do you do about that for you? There's a face i've not seen before

[13774.92s -> 13776.92s]  The menials have all rebelled
[13777.56s -> 13779.56s]  They gave me good service or so. I thought
[13780.36s -> 13782.36s]  But it seems it was all an act
[13783.16s -> 13787.88s]  Foul creatures as it said and true enough they're foul inside getting quieter
[13788.52s -> 13790.52s]  I'm sorry to disappoint you
[13790.76s -> 13794.78s]  But whatever you come here to do castle mourn

[13816.14s -> 13818.14s]  Oh my audio has been fucked up the whole time
[13818.94s -> 13820.94s]  Even if the castle should fall
[13821.10s -> 13823.10s]  As commander I must remain
[13823.82s -> 13828.78s]  To ensure the treasured sword of mourn does not fall into the hold of the morning

[13991.70s -> 13993.94s]  ice cream bar packaging bite
[13994.50s -> 13996.90s]  Which is like the corner of the top of the ice cream

[14215.14s -> 14228.73s]  Who's over there? Oh, no father gravestone. Of course
[14234.46s -> 14236.46s]  I must fulfill my duty
[14236.94s -> 14239.62s]  I must fulfill my duty
[14239.62s -> 14244.42s]  I almost just I almost died. I jumped for no reason and it was the only thing that kept me alive
[14244.90s -> 14246.90s]  I actually just died right there
[14257.05s -> 14259.05s]  I must take my leave

[14281.24s -> 14285.40s]  They're they're just so good. There's some I wish I knew who they were
[14286.12s -> 14288.84s]  I feel like I don't know any of the other things that these actors have been in
[14292.23s -> 14299.77s]  I missed an item what I am
[14301.18s -> 14305.37s]  Did I was talking

[14333.88s -> 14335.32s]  Oh, yes elden won
[14335.40s -> 14340.12s]  You never noticed they get really close that when it's like a celebrity that doesn't really like do voice acting or act really
[14340.76s -> 14343.80s]  They're always super close to the microphone and they're just talking loudly
[14344.36s -> 14347.32s]  It's like loud talking is not acting but that's what they do
[14350.73s -> 14356.15s]  Oh my goodness. I can't believe what we're looking at here. No, you're not gonna get that by me
[14356.95s -> 14358.95s]  Loud talking always equals acting
[14359.35s -> 14373.13s]  Okay, I got 8200. Are you guys ready for me to one shot kill?
[14373.85s -> 14375.85s]  this
[14384.73s -> 14390.92s]  Oh, that's I gotta make sure I have at least one of those every like every 30 minutes or so
[14390.92s -> 14394.92s]  So the editors can make sure they get something funny like a clip like a funny clip or not
[14396.28s -> 14398.76s]  I gotta do like every like 30 minutes. I haven't done it in a while
[14403.46s -> 14409.86s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
[14409.86s -> 14412.26s]  Anything else over this way? I'm just checking
[14413.14s -> 14415.48s]  Shut up
[14415.48s -> 14417.48s]  What are you doing over there? Shut up
[14427.45s -> 14434.38s]  Whoa, that's the edge of the world. Oh, I got a somber smithing stone
[14434.94s -> 14444.66s]  Can't go on the horse something over there
[14446.74s -> 14454.84s]  It's
[14454.84s -> 14456.84s]  Crab the huge crab
[14456.84s -> 14458.84s]  in every fucking zone
[14459.24s -> 14482.76s]  But I mean that's not even surprising anymore. It's not even surprising to me anymore. It's so bad. I'm gonna do it
[14483.77s -> 14485.37s]  Why should I do it?
[14485.37s -> 14489.02s]  I don't think I want to do it on camera. So i'll hide
[14489.50s -> 14502.55s]  No, i'm not gonna do it. Fuck
[14504.70s -> 14517.64s]  No, never mind
[14517.64s -> 14519.70s]  Is this gonna kill me?
[14519.70s -> 14523.30s]  Be serious. Will this kill me if I go down? No, I think it might i'm gonna go from the bridge
[14527.69s -> 14530.33s]  Oh those those actors are so goddamn funny
[14531.29s -> 14535.82s]  That was so fun
[14535.82s -> 14538.22s]  I don't I think I want to level up first
[14541.45s -> 14554.36s]  Yeah, let's just kill these guys until we level up. What do these guys give us? It's not very much
[14554.92s -> 14575.18s]  It's not a lot who has some decent amount of souls. It's too much to go die at a boss with
[14575.90s -> 14590.74s]  Because i'll probably die like once choice
[14591.06s -> 14599.16s]  I just need to get some souls here
[14600.12s -> 14603.30s]  Is that an item up there?
[14605.80s -> 14616.63s]  No, all right, you're gonna kill the guy this is literally the easiest boss in the game
[14618.65s -> 14622.33s]  Yeah, but I okay if it don't say that because then if I lose then I look bad
[14622.81s -> 14629.58s]  I'm that i'm not that far. I'm gonna kill the big giant guy
[14655.78s -> 14659.05s]  I don't know, man
[14660.76s -> 14669.37s]  Okay, there's 11 000 I got one of these
[14675.13s -> 14676.41s]  Boink
[14676.41s -> 14686.01s]  All right, getting there almost there almost there almost there. All right, i'll go kill him. Fine. Jeremy, please the boss is like pinwheel
[14686.09s -> 14689.15s]  Fine, okay, it's pinwheel. The boss is pinwheel
[14692.25s -> 14699.24s]  Fine, i'll go all this for a single level. I'll go get him right now. He's pinwheel. Well, let's show him. Let's show him his boss
[14699.88s -> 14704.89s]  It's literally pinwheel. All right. All right. All right. All right, relax. I'll go get him
[14708.70s -> 14711.34s]  This boss is the easiest boss in the game. Okay, fine
[14722.66s -> 14723.84s]  leonine
[14723.84s -> 14749.56s]  Misbegotten
[14749.56s -> 14751.56s]  I wouldn't call this guy pinwheel
[14751.56s -> 14783.75s]  This guy ain't fucking pinwheel
[14784.07s -> 14843.50s]  This guy ain't fucking pinwheel. This guy's got moves
[14844.54s -> 14856.73s]  Good thing I have like a good. Yeah, i'll get him. It's not that bad
[14857.37s -> 14864.63s]  Like I also I like where where
[14865.35s -> 14866.23s]  those
[14866.23s -> 14871.35s]  Fucking sacred tears. I thought they were down here. All right, relax
[14872.23s -> 14877.85s]  How have I only found one the whole time? I played this game. It's impossible
[14878.73s -> 14901.06s]  All right. Now i'm like trying too hard
[14901.22s -> 14931.58s]  Bump heads bumped into each other. That's weird
[14986.66s -> 14988.66s]  Crafted blade great sword
[14995.91s -> 14998.23s]  What the heck is that?
[14999.11s -> 15002.92s]  strength
[15002.92s -> 15011.24s]  Oh my goodness gracious
[15013.67s -> 15020.84s]  This looks like the shit that you pick out of your leg if you've been when you go into the woods
[15021.56s -> 15024.06s]  The things that like are just attached to your body
[15026.92s -> 15044.26s]  What does it move? Is it a block? That's pretty cool weapon
[15044.90s -> 15052.73s]  Uh, yeah, that guy wasn't that bad. But I mean I i'm obviously probably five plus levels leveled for it
[15056.31s -> 15060.55s]  Look with churches
[15060.55s -> 15064.50s]  I mean church I need to find a church
[15065.14s -> 15068.14s]  I mean
[15068.14s -> 15078.55s]  bro
[15078.55s -> 15080.97s]  Can I just get another one of those?
[15080.97s -> 15082.49s]  All right. Well, that's cool
[15082.49s -> 15084.65s]  That's a really cool fight
[15084.65s -> 15089.48s]  Nothing too. Nothing too fancy schmancy. Just gotta kill them
[15090.04s -> 15098.36s]  Okay, uh, so let's go from here
[15100.97s -> 15104.25s]  Is this a church right here? That looks kind of church ish
[15105.46s -> 15107.46s]  That looks kind of like the top of the church
[15107.54s -> 15112.65s]  Either that or here
[15112.65s -> 15115.94s]  That's not a church
[15115.94s -> 15118.66s]  What where's the church? I'm looking for a church. Is this a church?
[15121.43s -> 15126.22s]  They're marked on the map
[15126.22s -> 15127.90s]  That looks like a church
[15127.90s -> 15133.61s]  This looks like I there's no church here
[15134.49s -> 15137.75s]  It looked like ruins
[15137.75s -> 15139.75s]  This looks like it i'm gonna go to two
[15148.10s -> 15150.10s]  Why does everything look like a church to you?
[15153.34s -> 15156.46s]  Everything doesn't look like a church that I mean like if they're all buildings
[15165.70s -> 15167.22s]  That looks like a church
[15167.22s -> 15174.31s]  We're gonna check it out
[15174.31s -> 15177.19s]  Oh, let me go talk to um, what's that? The the girl?
[15178.07s -> 15180.31s]  I gotta go talk to the girl that I gave the letter
[15180.87s -> 15184.42s]  She's like give this letter to my father. He's right here, right?
[15185.06s -> 15186.58s]  There was she right here
[15186.58s -> 15188.20s]  It was right here somewhere
[15188.20s -> 15192.55s]  Is she at the rampart or was she at the gate?
[15192.95s -> 15195.51s]  Where is she?
[15195.51s -> 15199.80s]  She was back here, right?
[15200.76s -> 15203.29s]  Can you just take a shower?
[15203.29s -> 15205.61s]  Don't tell me when I need to clean. Okay
[15206.33s -> 15212.26s]  I assure you I am very clean
[15212.82s -> 15238.74s]  Do I have to really go to the other one?
[15238.74s -> 15257.02s]  Remember you too stressed out today. I'm fine run and jump. I said I just did that
[15257.66s -> 15267.43s]  She's right here. Where is she? Where is she? Isn't she right here?
[15268.07s -> 15281.18s]  I thought she was sitting like right over here somewhere
[15302.30s -> 15304.06s]  Wait, what?
[15304.06s -> 15305.88s]  She's dead
[15305.88s -> 15310.86s]  You mean she's dead
[15310.86s -> 15313.26s]  Somebody drop a sword on her from up there
[15317.69s -> 15319.69s]  All right. Oops
[15325.78s -> 15327.78s]  I'm gonna be in big fucking trouble
[15330.46s -> 15333.26s]  Frank I was never fucking on the rampart. Please you gotta help me
[15337.48s -> 15341.13s]  uh
[15341.13s -> 15363.29s]  Dad was over here. Dad was like up in the tower up there. She should level up. I will
[15363.77s -> 15379.85s]  Where was the dad up on the I just said my object permanence especially with the game with this 500 million places to go
[15380.81s -> 15385.86s]  Is he was up in one of these that one there? I think he was further in
[15386.66s -> 15397.96s]  so yeah, he was actually like inside the castle and
[15399.80s -> 15403.18s]  Lift I remember him just sitting on top of one of these things
[15404.06s -> 15414.33s]  Here, but like the rampart has a gotta go through and up to the left tower
[15416.82s -> 15436.14s]  Does this go up? I'm not in the castle right now
[15437.10s -> 15441.08s]  I remember doing this and then he's like up in there
[15441.72s -> 15443.72s]  I
[15443.72s -> 15446.86s]  Don't know. I have no idea where he is
[15447.26s -> 15452.31s]  You can't remember the dungeon. He just cleared it. No, dude. I can't because this it's it's so big
[15452.47s -> 15454.47s]  There's so much to see there's so much going on
[15455.43s -> 15457.43s]  I like it's so hard to remember everything
[15459.24s -> 15461.32s]  I have absolutely no idea how to get up there
[15464.47s -> 15469.59s]  Like if you gave me a 100 million dollars right now and said in 10 seconds show me on the map where he is
[15470.47s -> 15473.83s]  I wouldn't be able to do it. I physically wouldn't do it. I wouldn't be able to
[15474.79s -> 15484.89s]  What I should have done is I should have marked where he was
[15485.69s -> 15503.13s]  Because the the thing with the souls games for me and this probably happens to a lot of you guys too
[15503.61s -> 15507.21s]  is you have like an ever moving window of stuff that you know
[15508.01s -> 15508.97s]  and like
[15508.97s -> 15513.45s]  It just keeps moving like this and the and all you can remember and all you can do
[15513.93s -> 15517.93s]  Is the shit in this line here and it moves with you
[15518.49s -> 15520.49s]  So like you'll get through an area
[15521.13s -> 15523.13s]  And like you you start here
[15523.13s -> 15528.33s]  Oh, there he is. He's on top of the fucking rampart. I know where that guy is and then like a half an hour later
[15529.29s -> 15533.53s]  It's like that guy never existed. It's like you can't even go back that far. It's moving with you
[15535.93s -> 15538.33s]  So like now I now I remember where he is
[15539.13s -> 15546.63s]  Now I remember he's up there. I was gonna get them. It's the fastest way to get that this way
[15556.34s -> 15558.34s]  It's like there's an ever moving window
[15559.22s -> 15562.10s]  Of like stuff that I can remember in these games
[15564.02s -> 15566.50s]  Because remember in the back of my mind i'm thinking about like
[15567.14s -> 15569.14s]  All the whiz why do I where's my weapon?
[15573.98s -> 15578.14s]  There's so much other side info in the back of my head that I need to remember
[15579.18s -> 15580.54s]  That's just here
[15580.54s -> 15582.54s]  And they all get mixed up together and putt
[15583.02s -> 15596.26s]  That's what the notepad is for. Well, that's what the markers are for, but i'm not using them
[15596.88s -> 15625.26s]  Effectively. Okay, so he's like here all the way up there you motherfucker. How do I go over there?
[15628.87s -> 15630.87s]  Um, don't die for the love of god, please
[15631.83s -> 15657.48s]  Is he gonna die on here and then up we're good, right? Am I going the right way? There's something else here
[15661.43s -> 15670.07s]  Yeah, I found something else
[15675.40s -> 15679.32s]  Ooh a smithing stone. Okay, so he's like up there
[15680.12s -> 15684.42s]  Is he on this one or is he on the other one?
[15686.02s -> 15689.74s]  No, he's definitely on this one. This is right
[15690.70s -> 15701.43s]  Other way, I never got that item the east corner
[15703.22s -> 15705.61s]  He's like in here
[15705.61s -> 15707.61s]  What would it be at would he be at the fire?
[15707.93s -> 15715.93s]  Is there a ladder that I didn't see?
[15715.93s -> 15717.93s]  Bps needed this is not east
[15719.59s -> 15720.87s]  This is east
[15720.87s -> 15729.35s]  What are you talking about? Not south. I can't I can't go any more east
[15730.23s -> 15732.23s]  There's no more east I can go
[15732.47s -> 15737.69s]  Even here
[15737.69s -> 15741.53s]  He's dead dickheads over there. All right, fucking god. Damn it, man
[15742.95s -> 15744.95s]  I thought he was up in one of those like tower things
[15745.51s -> 15759.61s]  And there's like so many like roundabouts and like ladders you climb and then jump down and then drop down and go around the corner
[15760.09s -> 15762.09s]  It's it's kind of hard to navigate
[15767.21s -> 15769.85s]  There's not just a ladder sitting in front of that it's like
[15770.25s -> 15774.41s]  Go up climb up and then go around that side and then drop down and then go around the rock around the bridge
[15774.41s -> 15776.17s]  And then up and into the right
[15776.17s -> 15795.11s]  I can't just she's dead
[15801.18s -> 15803.06s]  What does that do?
[15803.06s -> 15807.32s]  Kill him. I don't think I want to kill he might show up later
[15815.11s -> 15819.12s]  I'm not gonna kill him now go back to her location
[15830.18s -> 15832.18s]  Freaking 100 million dollars
[15858.90s -> 15861.14s]  I chose duty over my daughter's safety
[15862.18s -> 15863.06s]  and
[15863.06s -> 15865.22s]  That is how fate has answered
[15868.22s -> 15871.77s]  Find them wretched responsible for this
[15872.41s -> 15876.33s]  I'll hunt them down and exterminate every last one of them
[15876.97s -> 15878.49s]  Rest assured
[15878.49s -> 15880.79s]  Arena, it will be done
[15883.96s -> 15886.76s]  Find the foul i'll hunt them down. Rest assured
[15887.40s -> 15888.44s]  Okay
[15888.44s -> 15891.13s]  Oh
[15891.45s -> 15899.56s]  Now what is that that's at the end of his little thing there
[15900.20s -> 15902.86s]  I don't think i'm gonna kill him
[15902.86s -> 15904.94s]  That's it kill him kill
[15907.59s -> 15912.46s]  Why would I kill him?
[15912.46s -> 15915.18s]  He definitely shows up later. Why wouldn't he? No, i'm not killing him
[15918.74s -> 15924.50s]  All right time to go to the church and get my god damn for the first time in history
[15925.46s -> 15928.84s]  A flask level up for the first time in history
[15934.36s -> 15935.64s]  We're going
[15935.64s -> 15960.02s]  to number three
[15960.02s -> 15961.86s]  Up here around the left
[15961.86s -> 15966.17s]  You should have plus four by the time you go back to really
[15967.05s -> 15985.85s]  Enter evergale
[15985.85s -> 15987.29s]  the area
[15987.29s -> 15993.50s]  market
[15993.50s -> 15996.62s]  No, no, no, no go to church. I know hold on
[15997.50s -> 16006.58s]  I lost my marker
[16006.58s -> 16009.62s]  What the fuck is happening with these markers four?
[16010.34s -> 16026.60s]  I feel like i'm gonna die if I drop don't kill me, please
[16027.24s -> 16029.62s]  Okay
[16029.62s -> 16035.96s]  I'm begging you read the map
[16038.92s -> 16040.92s]  That is 2d. It's hard to read this
[16041.56s -> 16054.76s]  Can I even get across there from I don't think I can make it from here. Maybe this way
[16065.32s -> 16066.28s]  Oh
[16066.28s -> 16067.62s]  Let's go
[16067.62s -> 16084.89s]  Hey, it's all good to find a way
[16085.13s -> 16094.81s]  Oh my god
[16094.81s -> 16108.34s]  This was kind of way out of the fucking way. My boys are way cooler
[16110.70s -> 16112.07s]  All right
[16112.07s -> 16114.28s]  Give me one
[16114.28s -> 16115.56s]  mausoleum prowls
[16115.56s -> 16117.56s]  Cradling the soulless demigod
[16118.20s -> 16124.84s]  Purchase pilgrimage

[16135.98s -> 16137.34s]  upgrade
[16137.34s -> 16140.14s]  Upgrade upgrade upgrade time
[16146.44s -> 16150.44s]  Add a charge sacred tear. Let's go. Thank you
[16151.32s -> 16159.56s]  Okay
[16159.56s -> 16166.25s]  Uh, that's that church. I see a church right here. Is that a church? I think that's a church
[16166.25s -> 16183.61s]  How do I get over there?
[16183.61s -> 16186.98s]  Any more churches?
[16186.98s -> 16188.98s]  in this direct vicinity
[16189.30s -> 16192.57s]  would be
[16192.57s -> 16198.09s]  I'm gonna investigate these these could be
[16198.89s -> 16220.34s]  Four and five that's definitely a church over there. All right. Hell. Yeah, let's fucking come on man. Can we do this?
[16221.14s -> 16230.84s]  How many seats do I have that I that was my third so I i have zero now
[16236.95s -> 16239.99s]  This is definitely not a church, but that is so i'll have plus three
[16242.49s -> 16244.17s]  back here later
[16244.17s -> 16261.69s]  What is that? What the hell is that?
[16269.00s -> 16271.00s]  I don't I don't want to fuck with that thing right now
[16272.12s -> 16277.93s]  No, not yet, there's no heads
[16286.70s -> 16288.70s]  Give me another flask thing
[16289.10s -> 16291.10s]  This is definitely a church
[16294.87s -> 16301.69s]  Fourth church of marika. Oh, yeah
[16313.19s -> 16318.23s]  Okay, i'm in a much better position now. I played this whole damn game without this. How did I fucking do that?
[16323.14s -> 16325.14s]  Very nice. I'm gonna say
[16325.78s -> 16331.42s]  seven and two
[16331.50s -> 16332.46s]  Uh
[16332.46s -> 16337.67s]  Is there any more?
[16337.67s -> 16348.04s]  What about like here?
[16348.04s -> 16349.88s]  This looks kind of church-like
[16349.88s -> 16355.26s]  Investigate that tree
[16357.08s -> 16366.84s]  on the map
[16366.84s -> 16369.16s]  This do you mean this one? I think I already was over here
[16374.28s -> 16393.58s]  I think I want maybe let me wait and then I need to level up either health or more intelligence. Yeah
[16402.46s -> 16404.30s]  Go to the tower. That's here
[16404.30s -> 16421.24s]  The game just crashed going on you're gonna come back. Oh, it's the last thing that happened
[16426.36s -> 16432.34s]  Hold on if the stream dies, i'll be right back. I hope it doesn't hold on
[16439.22s -> 16444.60s]  Uh, that was weird
[16448.46s -> 16463.48s]  Um, I think i'm okay. I think i'm okay. Yeah, we're good. That was weird
[16464.04s -> 16475.30s]  I spammed the markers so they crashed my game. I'm annoying. Hopefully I didn't lose any progress or anything
[16480.41s -> 16485.45s]  Uh, there's an eldering save conflict. Uh, definitely the one from like 10 five two minutes ago
[16486.09s -> 16493.93s]  My computer's locking up now. What the fuck is going on?
[16495.13s -> 16497.13s]  What the fuck is happening dude?
[16498.09s -> 16499.58s]  I pressed
[16499.58s -> 16503.00s]  Put a marker down five times and then my whole computer's locking up
[16507.14s -> 16526.47s]  Fuck off windows update. No, no, it's just the game just died. Okay. Well, hope I didn't lose any progress
[16526.87s -> 16534.38s]  Let's come back
[16534.38s -> 16536.38s]  I don't think I lost any progress
[16537.37s -> 16539.93s]  Last save was the local file was from a minute ago. So
[16540.57s -> 16559.43s]  Let's hope not
[16559.43s -> 16562.86s]  Yeah, all right. We're fine. That was very odd
[16563.58s -> 16576.60s]  Yeah, I think we're good
[16576.60s -> 16578.60s]  So I needed to go down here
[16579.00s -> 16583.03s]  Okay, i'm gonna do that slower now
[16583.27s -> 16590.31s]  I think I clicked it too fast. So I want to go here
[16592.70s -> 16593.74s]  Maybe here
[16593.74s -> 16604.15s]  Let's go. Oh, it's a little house
[16612.82s -> 16614.18s]  Love love work
[16614.18s -> 16623.77s]  People just hanging out on the beach
[16623.77s -> 16625.77s]  Something in the water. What's that?
[16627.83s -> 16638.78s]  Oh, it's just a tree never mind game's sick
[16639.74s -> 16651.75s]  All right. Who's this person?
[16656.89s -> 16659.85s]  They all have such interesting stuff well, there's a lantern but I don't I don't need it
[16660.65s -> 16663.14s]  Another key. All right. Well, you're cool
[16666.14s -> 16673.42s]  Enjoy your shack
[16673.42s -> 16675.42s]  Okay. So is this a church up here?
[16682.87s -> 16689.26s]  Uh, I have the spell. I don't really need it three crunchies
[16695.53s -> 16697.05s]  three crunchies
[16697.05s -> 16698.33s]  Crunchy spot
[16698.33s -> 16709.08s]  Okay, that's what that is. So then what's this?
[16709.40s -> 16722.31s]  I'm really sorry, but I was afraid that you're gonna all people get me
[16723.11s -> 16739.00s]  All right. Well, it's not over here. I gotta go back up to like land
[16739.80s -> 16750.71s]  I can't like catch it
[16750.71s -> 16759.96s]  There we go. That thing is so weird. I gotta go see what that thing actually does
[16783.62s -> 16785.62s]  Stop bringing the bell. It's annoying me
[16786.98s -> 16798.74s]  All right, what's up here?
[16798.74s -> 16807.72s]  What a guy great dragon fly head
[16808.28s -> 16823.37s]  What do you got? This doesn't look like a church, but there's something here
[16824.09s -> 16825.93s]  our return
[16830.02s -> 16838.01s]  Climb you get to play the king's field games
[16838.81s -> 16840.65s]  No, not a chance
[16840.65s -> 16841.85s]  not a chance
[16841.85s -> 16844.81s]  I've seen gameplay of king's field and
[16845.53s -> 16848.09s]  It just looks I could I don't think I could do it
[16848.81s -> 16857.37s]  It seems like uh, what's that first person?
[16858.01s -> 16861.21s]  rpg game
[16861.29s -> 16865.53s]  It's a first person rpg. That's really really strange
[16868.23s -> 16874.33s]  Nope, actually, let's do it. Wait
[16875.61s -> 16886.54s]  Wait, nothing in there
[16886.86s -> 16904.57s]  I go i'm just gonna go i'm curious where it takes me lindell royal capital
[16908.15s -> 16918.39s]  Dear okay. Well, uh, okay. Where am I?
[16928.46s -> 16930.46s]  Somebody lying down
[16930.86s -> 16947.88s]  Oh, yeah, you're gonna get up obviously
[16948.36s -> 16951.11s]  There's a chest over there
[16951.19s -> 16975.88s]  stagger him
[16975.88s -> 16977.16s]  Jesus
[16977.16s -> 16996.52s]  Stop trying to squash me. Oh my god
[16997.32s -> 17011.51s]  This early end game area. Oh fuck I can beat this guy. Let me kill this guy
[17011.51s -> 17033.77s]  He probably drops like 20 000 souls. He's gonna fall off
[17035.05s -> 17036.09s]  I can't
[17036.09s -> 17037.88s]  I don't
[17037.88s -> 17039.88s]  He's gonna is he gonna fall?
[17040.46s -> 17042.86s]  Who falls first here? I don't know. Okay. Can he fall?
[17043.90s -> 17053.61s]  I don't think he can touch as I want him to
[17068.57s -> 17100.74s]  All right still not enough
[17117.29s -> 17130.26s]  Whoa, I didn't get it. I thought I staggered him I get it
[17132.01s -> 17134.01s]  Nope, I thought he was falling down. I'm good
[17134.98s -> 17138.34s]  I every time it goes like oh down to one knee. I keep I think i'm staggering you
[17139.06s -> 17154.78s]  Your face is red
[17154.78s -> 17157.02s]  I'm gonna try this one more time. I'm not supposed to be here. So i'm gonna leave
[17157.82s -> 17177.82s]  But I feel like I can do it. Fuck you, buddy
[17182.10s -> 17185.30s]  Yeah, fuck off. I'm taking you a freaking free shit
[17186.26s -> 17209.86s]  Thank you. Thanks for the talisman. I'm not supposed to be here. It don't matter
[17222.54s -> 17228.82s]  I'm i'm out. I got the item. I got the item. I'm not supposed to be here
[17229.70s -> 17237.94s]  There's a dead end mini boss
[17237.94s -> 17239.94s]  There's a portal on the other side
[17241.62s -> 17245.96s]  Does he actually drop anything?
[17245.96s -> 17247.96s]  I mean, I know this isn't a boss
[17249.78s -> 17251.78s]  These enemies that are like as big as the whole screen
[17252.26s -> 17254.26s]  It's just so hard to tell when they're gonna swing it
[17282.44s -> 17283.80s]  I'll get him
[17283.80s -> 17289.37s]  He's gonna stop being greedy hit him twice and run away. Otherwise, you physically cannot see what he's doing
[17297.94s -> 17301.14s]  They fall over. Yeah that but I need to do more damage
[17302.92s -> 17305.56s]  You got this tomato boy, shut up
[17382.55s -> 17387.54s]  I knew that was gonna happen
[17390.97s -> 17394.55s]  He was just too close to the edge. I thought he was gonna do the thing where he pulls up
[17395.03s -> 17403.74s]  Maybe i'll try jump attacking
[17403.74s -> 17419.10s]  I feel like I won't hit him in the ankle though
[17419.10s -> 17423.26s]  What actually worked?
[17424.06s -> 17431.13s]  I did that two times
[17431.13s -> 17447.72s]  That staggers that much. Oh my goodness. Are you kidding me, dude?
[17448.92s -> 17453.21s]  I don't stagger that much
[17457.61s -> 17479.30s]  Just made that not even a problem holy shit
[17480.26s -> 17483.66s]  Oh my goodness, okay. Well
[17484.14s -> 17489.43s]  That's one way I had to do that
[17489.43s -> 17492.63s]  That's more stagger than a fully charged right trigger
[17493.43s -> 17504.38s]  Well, there was no point in that but it was fun
[17505.02s -> 17508.60s]  All right. What was the talisman?
[17510.47s -> 17512.71s]  Slowly restores hp by how much?
[17513.35s -> 17530.87s]  I think I want that that's cool. All right. What was what was I doing? I was trying to get more flasks, right?
[17531.59s -> 17546.09s]  I think cool. Okay
[17546.73s -> 17549.53s]  I have a few options
[17549.53s -> 17551.83s]  option one
[17551.83s -> 17553.83s]  Go kill this goddamn dragon
[17555.46s -> 17557.45s]  option two
[17557.45s -> 17562.09s]  Go finish whatever's going on and carry a manor because I think I didn't complete it all
[17564.25s -> 17566.58s]  uh
[17566.58s -> 17568.58s]  option four
[17570.84s -> 17577.19s]  Head down here
[17577.19s -> 17578.79s]  Big tree, please
[17578.79s -> 17600.86s]  All right option five. I'll go to big tree. All right, big tree is at number one. Let's go
[17601.42s -> 17609.54s]  I wonder if I should mess around with this too
[17616.98s -> 17619.22s]  Oh, there it is the tower
[17619.22s -> 17621.78s]  Finally can return to our home bathed in rays of gold
[17629.40s -> 17634.55s]  I'm getting my revenge
[17634.55s -> 17637.11s]  No, the person said go to the okay. I'm gonna go to the tree

[17641.38s -> 17643.78s]  That person that just said dude go to the tree just almost flipped out
[17645.45s -> 17663.80s]  I'm going to the tree
[17663.80s -> 17667.48s]  Do the bell do the bell. I gotta do the tree before I gotta do the tree first
[17667.96s -> 17670.44s]  Don't go. I need to do the tree first. Trust me
[17671.24s -> 17673.96s]  I'm a i'm not a doctor. I don't want to say that. That's that's fake
[17674.76s -> 17677.48s]  I don't want somebody to be like, oh dude, what happened? What do you think about my bike?
[17677.80s -> 17679.96s]  The I got this like pimple on my back. I don't care
[17682.15s -> 17684.60s]  All right. I'm here
[17684.60s -> 17685.80s]  What's here?
[17685.80s -> 17690.38s]  What do we got? Minor urd tree
[17691.02s -> 17706.41s]  What do we got?
[17706.41s -> 17722.26s]  singing
[17722.26s -> 17742.57s]  What's here? There's nothing here. At least not that I can see
[17755.67s -> 17758.15s]  Is a go to the pots something on the pots
[17759.03s -> 17765.45s]  It's like a time of day thing
[17765.45s -> 17773.77s]  Who's that? Oh, this person's singing
[17775.11s -> 17778.82s]  urd tree avatar
[17778.82s -> 17782.34s]  Okay, let's go
[17782.58s -> 17784.10s]  The caster
[17784.10s -> 17799.98s]  It's like a tree trunk
[17799.98s -> 17813.10s]  This boss is kind of cool
[17813.18s -> 17830.58s]  Not bad. I see. Oh my god. Stop talking
[17832.26s -> 17835.72s]  Gerva stop talking
[17836.90s -> 17880.54s]  Stop talking
[17880.54s -> 17882.54s]  Line aside. Haha, stupid
[17902.86s -> 17909.46s]  Got it. He knows chat will make fun of him if we use magic
[17910.02s -> 17914.30s]  Okay, so that was
[17914.36s -> 17918.78s]  Opalene bubble tear and crimson burst crystal tear
[17922.26s -> 17922.98s]  Oh
[17922.98s -> 17925.30s]  That was worse than the boss. That was scary than the boss
[17926.02s -> 17928.36s]  Thank you game. Oh my god
[17929.40s -> 17934.30s]  okay
[17934.30s -> 17939.03s]  enhances charge attacks for
[17940.01s -> 17942.65s]  set sadly reduces hp
[17944.97s -> 17947.85s]  Significantly negates damage in mixed physique. What do these do?
[17948.57s -> 17954.78s]  What do these do?
[17954.78s -> 17956.78s]  flask of wondrous physique
[17956.78s -> 17964.14s]  I need a I still need the flask. I don't have
[17964.86s -> 17968.18s]  You can make potions with them. Oh cool. Okay
[17968.98s -> 17970.82s]  That was cool
[17970.82s -> 17974.42s]  All right. Now I gotta go to the tree you go to the tree cool. Okay, so now
[17975.22s -> 17979.38s]  That was pretty cool fight
[17979.38s -> 17982.26s]  It's time for I gotta get my revenge. I have to get my revenge
[17982.42s -> 17994.41s]  I have to kill this fucking dragon before I lose my mind back off the horse
[18003.46s -> 18005.46s]  All right, don't get one hit killed
[18007.10s -> 18008.46s]  This is it
[18008.46s -> 18017.72s]  I'm coming in here with knowledge with more flasks. I'm ready
[18018.68s -> 18023.00s]  I have three attempts. We're not angry. We're having a good time together
[18023.16s -> 18025.16s]  You and me are hanging out here
[18034.46s -> 18180.76s]  Got a little greedy. I thought I was gonna be able to sprint away from it
[18181.32s -> 18184.33s]  I thought I was gonna be able to sprint through
[18186.82s -> 18191.14s]  God damn man. That fucking insta kill is kind of horseshit if i'm honest
[18192.50s -> 18194.82s]  I was trying to do this like just sprint away from it
[18195.54s -> 18204.49s]  Okay, so I can't sprint. I can't jump because jumping i'll hit his body when he lands and instantly kills you
[18208.92s -> 18210.44s]  You game what?
[18210.44s -> 18218.87s]  Because when he like when he comes down, I wonder
[18219.59s -> 18222.73s]  Instead of running sideways run like forward
[18223.53s -> 18237.99s]  Okay, i'm stuck in his body
[18237.99s -> 18309.34s]  It's bad. All right. Here we go. Here we go
[18309.58s -> 18311.58s]  Forward straight straight straight straight
[18311.66s -> 18355.98s]  God, that's plain. Where'd you go? Don't be greedy. I'm gonna try not to i'm not gonna be greedy
[18364.70s -> 18367.18s]  Didn't fucking work that time. I was running straight
[18367.98s -> 18370.98s]  Just got lucky and went right between his legs
[18390.84s -> 18437.32s]  bad
[18437.32s -> 18443.40s]  No, don't do that again
[18443.48s -> 18445.56s]  Someone invade him. I'm not playing online
[18446.36s -> 18448.04s]  I'm not getting invaded
[18448.04s -> 18593.78s]  Get stamina stamina stamina. I'm such a coward. I'm too afraid
[18618.49s -> 18642.17s]  Don't freak out. It's bugs all over my fucking body
[18695.00s -> 18702.15s]  Oh, man
[18702.15s -> 18703.45s]  Get out of here
[18703.45s -> 18706.73s]  God that was fucking horrible. That wasn't even that bad. It was just smart
[18707.45s -> 18710.49s]  What did I drop?
[18710.49s -> 18712.70s]  The dragon heart?
[18712.70s -> 18716.70s]  Neutriconic power is available. Let's go
[18717.42s -> 18732.15s]  Let's go
[18732.15s -> 18734.39s]  Do you're pursing your lips so much they're turning purple
[18735.19s -> 18742.60s]  I'll get some blood back into it
[18742.60s -> 18744.92s]  It looks like i've been drinking wine for like four hours
[18745.64s -> 18762.09s]  The item dropped an item you look cold. I'm not cold. I'm actually burning up
[18762.97s -> 18779.43s]  Description is nonsense. Okay. Okay, all right. We cleaned up a little bit
[18779.99s -> 18783.51s]  I'm gonna level up and then I think it's time
[18784.55s -> 18791.37s]  It might be time. It was an item at your feet. Was there actually?
[18792.25s -> 18796.60s]  I mean, this is where I killed him. I don't see one
[18797.69s -> 18806.90s]  item item item item
[18807.06s -> 18808.94s]  We're
[18808.94s -> 18812.14s]  Dragon item. I mean I picked it up didn't I I don't see it on the ground
[18813.30s -> 18820.89s]  to the left
[18820.89s -> 18823.80s]  I just bait or are you guys serious?
[18824.44s -> 18827.91s]  I killed him right here
[18827.91s -> 18831.24s]  That's great
[18831.24s -> 18836.71s]  Okay, so now
[18836.71s -> 18850.14s]  That tied up that loose end. I'm just trying to tie up some loose ends. What time is it? What just happened?
[18850.62s -> 18864.76s]  That's fine. Okay, go back to where he spawned. Uh, I already got that item. I
[18865.32s -> 18867.32s]  I got that a long time ago
[18870.79s -> 18876.86s]  I mean somebody here. I already got this
[18877.50s -> 18883.06s]  Okay. So now i'm what i'm gonna do
[18883.78s -> 18885.78s]  Is i'm going to relax
[18885.86s -> 18888.26s]  i'm gonna chill i'm gonna just
[18888.74s -> 18890.50s]  Chill the heck out
[18890.50s -> 18892.02s]  i'm gonna level up
[18892.02s -> 18895.22s]  And i'm gonna try this guy
[18895.22s -> 18909.19s]  Two more times just two more times. I just want to try them two more times. That's it. I promise only two times
[18909.99s -> 18934.92s]  I'm only gonna try them two times. Oh upgrade. Oh look, uh, I can't really use them here anyways, but
[18935.72s -> 18939.43s]  How many souls do I actually have?
[18939.59s -> 18942.09s]  Okay, I have a lot
[18947.98s -> 18952.30s]  I spent all yesterday trying to beat him, but we got it done. All right, I gotta get him done
[18953.32s -> 18955.32s]  No more complaining
[18955.32s -> 18957.16s]  No complaints just
[18957.16s -> 18963.38s]  Beat him. I will go upgrade what I can upgrade and i'm gonna buy
[18965.42s -> 18966.71s]  Yeah
[18966.71s -> 18968.23s]  Yeah, okay
[18968.23s -> 18987.10s]  Give me a sec. So can I did I get anything else to upgrade? I kind of want to upgrade this other step
[18991.93s -> 18994.49s]  You need like 40 vigor to not get one shot
[18995.13s -> 18999.10s]  I feel like my health is kind of low. Maybe I should start focusing on it
[19001.02s -> 19010.95s]  I feel like i'm too spread out
[19010.95s -> 19023.11s]  Okay, i'm gonna use this eventually so i'm gonna level it up got a
[19023.65s -> 19026.47s]  Intelligence scaling i'm gonna get i'm gonna use this staff eventually
[19027.03s -> 19034.66s]  In fact, let me see what it is now. I think I can use it get the physique flask
[19035.14s -> 19046.60s]  Maybe i'll go check out that new dragon power
[19051.48s -> 19063.95s]  Maybe let me do my dumb shit first. Okay, i'm gonna buy this
[19066.94s -> 19071.10s]  I'm gonna buy that because i'm gonna use it and I can justify using it
[19071.74s -> 19076.70s]  Because I just bought it
[19076.70s -> 19078.70s]  Get the special flask
[19078.94s -> 19080.38s]  Somebody said it sucks
[19080.38s -> 19084.18s]  Because I so I just purchased that so i'm gonna turn it on
[19088.74s -> 19092.49s]  Where is it? So I have this one on
[19093.05s -> 19096.52s]  So let me activate it. I got 30 intelligence 25 decks
[19097.06s -> 19103.85s]  2020 let's see what happens. How do I use it? Here we go
[19107.06s -> 19116.76s]  Okay
[19116.76s -> 19118.76s]  35 intelligence
[19119.16s -> 19121.16s]  It's five plus five to everything
[19124.49s -> 19125.69s]  Okay
[19125.69s -> 19127.69s]  All right. All right. All right
[19127.69s -> 19130.02s]  um
[19130.02s -> 19132.02s]  I die though is a huge problem
[19132.58s -> 19139.58s]  That's a huge problem if I die should I even fight the boss?
[19140.38s -> 19145.74s]  I feel like I should not do that now and just do something else
[19146.55s -> 19157.19s]  All right. Here's what i'm gonna do
[19157.19s -> 19158.55s]  i'm gonna go
[19158.55s -> 19163.08s]  This way like here
[19163.32s -> 19166.86s]  either that
[19166.86s -> 19168.86s]  Or um, why is it still pointing down here?
[19169.66s -> 19171.90s]  This tree go to the earth tree
[19174.22s -> 19176.22s]  All right. What do you think?
[19177.08s -> 19180.18s]  up
[19180.18s -> 19181.78s]  south west
[19181.78s -> 19186.95s]  or north
[19186.95s -> 19187.83s]  flask
[19187.83s -> 19192.44s]  I don't want the flask
[19192.44s -> 19197.62s]  up three
[19197.62s -> 19199.22s]  Please get the flask
[19199.22s -> 19203.62s]  Drew, please. All right, just so chat stops yelling at me. Where's this flask?
[19204.34s -> 19211.51s]  They're going to get and stop screaming at me
[19214.31s -> 19216.41s]  It's where the
[19216.41s -> 19218.41s]  Port hate which was here
[19219.66s -> 19221.18s]  What here?
[19221.18s -> 19226.92s]  I'm not screaming
[19227.64s -> 19229.24s]  It's on the ship
[19229.32s -> 19231.38s]  In this ship right here
[19231.38s -> 19234.90s]  North of the mist wood like up here
[19236.46s -> 19238.46s]  here
[19238.46s -> 19242.87s]  Above the mist wood urn tree like somewhere like around here
[19244.15s -> 19249.29s]  I guess
[19249.29s -> 19251.43s]  Say that
[19251.43s -> 19253.80s]  All right, let's go there
[19262.94s -> 19267.48s]  That one is number five
[19270.92s -> 19275.11s]  Okay, you really need it. You'll be really glad that you got it
[19275.83s -> 19288.92s]  I'll give it a go
[19288.92s -> 19290.92s]  So this flask if I drink out of this
[19292.90s -> 19294.18s]  does it
[19294.18s -> 19297.58s]  Does it consume that little bubble?
[19297.66s -> 19300.86s]  Is it just a one and done or is it something I can just put on whenever I feel like it?
[19301.58s -> 19309.34s]  Sure punishes. Okay
[19309.34s -> 19311.34s]  Oh wait, this is also a church
[19311.50s -> 19313.50s]  I wonder if this is a sacred tier here as well
[19315.48s -> 19317.48s]  Oh, thank goodness. Okay good
[19320.78s -> 19322.78s]  and
[19322.78s -> 19329.10s]  Flask of wondrous physique you can find crystal tears at the basis of minor urn trees and elsewhere through the lands between
[19330.06s -> 19336.90s]  The size of grace you can mix two crystal tears in the flask of wondrous physique this will allow you to create elixirs the various custom effects
[19338.10s -> 19340.30s]  Okay
[19340.30s -> 19350.60s]  I mean he did all this without that. Yeah, dude. I don't know. I didn't I this this area this game is fucking huge
[19350.76s -> 19353.16s]  Uh, I I don't I didn't go to the one church
[19353.80s -> 19357.00s]  That had that I don't know. I've just been fucking run around
[19357.80s -> 19359.08s]  Don't get angry
[19359.08s -> 19371.69s]  Okay. So now what?
[19371.69s -> 19373.69s]  Mix wondrous physique
[19373.77s -> 19380.49s]  Restores half of total hp
[19383.61s -> 19387.80s]  Really boosts stamina significantly negates damage
[19389.22s -> 19391.21s]  damage and
[19391.21s -> 19392.58s]  and
[19392.58s -> 19397.45s]  stamina or damage and
[19397.93s -> 19398.89s]  um
[19398.89s -> 19403.91s]  damage and healing it's a one-time use
[19406.47s -> 19408.47s]  Bubble is basically a free hit
[19413.16s -> 19414.76s]  I would probably say
[19414.76s -> 19418.10s]  I don't know stamina is pretty big too, though
[19420.41s -> 19423.29s]  Healing over time is good. But stamina is also
[19426.20s -> 19429.32s]  I'm doing that. I'm doing I can take a hit and I have stamina
[19430.12s -> 19431.72s]  All right, go ahead and make it
[19431.72s -> 19437.75s]  work
[19437.75s -> 19439.67s]  so now
[19439.67s -> 19441.67s]  You can use it one time per death
[19444.58s -> 19445.98s]  What?
[19445.98s -> 19451.62s]  What?
[19451.62s -> 19460.98s]  What?
[19460.98s -> 19465.06s]  That's insane. So I can take a free hit and my stamina regenerates
[19465.78s -> 19468.54s]  It acts like a normal flask
[19469.88s -> 19471.88s]  No wonder everybody was screaming at me
[19475.85s -> 19477.85s]  Okay. Well, I got what I wanted
[19478.25s -> 19480.55s]  It's time to now decide
[19480.71s -> 19483.98s]  Do I want to try this guy?
[19484.06s -> 19486.54s]  again and get frustrated or do I
[19487.34s -> 19489.34s]  Get no i'll get killed and lose the buff
[19489.66s -> 19513.62s]  I'll go up from here
[19513.62s -> 19515.93s]  I'll check out this part this this place
[19528.44s -> 19539.90s]  I'm just gonna i'm gonna just ride in this direction and there's a big thing over there. Let's go that way
[19550.04s -> 19556.04s]  There's that area there. So what's over that? That's the I know that okay, but what about here?
[19557.48s -> 19559.78s]  I want to go like this way
[19560.18s -> 19566.23s]  Let me mark some stuff
[19566.23s -> 19575.80s]  Can I cross this?
[19575.80s -> 19577.56s]  I wonder I don't know
[19577.56s -> 19578.60s]  I don't
[19580.42s -> 19598.44s]  Okay, there's a bunch of these things down here
[19599.16s -> 19605.80s]  I wonder should I kill this thing? I feel like that that might be a bad thing
[19606.52s -> 19617.69s]  We're going that way. Is it safe to get anywhere from here? I think so
[19620.33s -> 19623.14s]  ah
[19627.48s -> 19638.92s]  Can I make that jump that's beautiful. Yeah, it's a beautiful view
[19643.53s -> 19669.99s]  What about over here very clearly is that death probably probably
[19669.99s -> 19676.25s]  Reliably
[19676.57s -> 19687.21s]  Okay, so how do I get down there reliably it has to be a way to get down there my buff
[19708.14s -> 19715.27s]  That sucks
[19715.27s -> 19718.22s]  Good thing at least I bought it
[19718.22s -> 19719.82s]  That's why I can never use that fucking thing
[19719.82s -> 19723.10s]  I never used humanities either because I would use them and just die in five seconds
[19723.50s -> 19727.74s]  Because I would just forget I turned it on or it would just be like I would fall off a building or something like
[19727.74s -> 19729.10s]  That's why I don't ever use them
[19729.10s -> 19732.94s]  I would use them for bosses like if I was about to fight a boss I would turn I would use the community
[19736.90s -> 19740.42s]  But uh, oh it turned on the humanity and then I would just like I would like answer the phone
[19741.14s -> 19744.50s]  Or I would like put a fucking cheeto in my mouth and forget everything and then just walk off the building
[19746.78s -> 19750.84s]  So I can't go that way
[19750.84s -> 19753.93s]  So how can I go out here?
[19756.18s -> 19759.14s]  I'm imagine i'm gonna okay i'm gonna go from here and i'm gonna go that way
[19759.86s -> 19766.46s]  See what I see this does what about the seal?
[19767.74s -> 19769.11s]  Wait
[19769.11s -> 19777.19s]  Wasn't that just to go back to the wasn't that just to go back to the academy? Isn't the seal to go back to the academy?
[19778.86s -> 19789.90s]  I already did the academy. Was it where was it? There were two seals
[19790.46s -> 19792.94s]  Oh, that's right. I walked up to one and it was like, sorry
[19796.01s -> 19797.82s]  wait
[19797.82s -> 19799.82s]  Telling me that I could literally just
[19804.39s -> 19806.39s]  I'm gonna appear at the end of the bridge aren't I?
[19825.93s -> 19827.93s]  Read my palm
[19847.08s -> 19849.08s]  And lift ahead
[19851.74s -> 19853.67s]  Or
[19853.67s -> 19858.39s]  Are you planning to throw this lady could be replaced with a wooden sign?
[19868.34s -> 19870.34s]  Okay, so this is a whole new area
[19870.42s -> 19891.27s]  Let's see how this plays out
[19891.27s -> 19897.61s]  All right. There's these knights here
[19898.41s -> 19902.55s]  Oh, he's beefy
[19902.55s -> 19941.38s]  I'm using the fucking tree
[19941.38s -> 19942.50s]  That hurts
[19942.50s -> 19963.98s]  This dude is definitely a milk drinker. It'd be me
[19964.38s -> 19971.45s]  I mean milk drinker. I don't I don't drink milk, man
[19972.25s -> 19988.92s]  That's I was just triangulated. I was literally triangulated
[19990.02s -> 19992.26s]  One, two, three, I couldn't fucking go anywhere
[19995.66s -> 19998.22s]  They like did I was like a fucking
[19998.94s -> 20010.15s]  Dirt hole trying to dig into a rock and animal crossing. Where even am I? Oh, fuck you really
[20020.54s -> 20029.22s]  All right. Yeah, we're bringing out oleg and not summon anybody here
[20030.97s -> 20032.97s]  Well, also I have a question
[20033.80s -> 20037.88s]  What is the criteria for summoning people? I feel like it's just like fucking random
[20038.60s -> 20042.20s]  What when can you summon when can I how come I can't summon people?
[20042.76s -> 20045.96s]  I feel like it's like oh, it's grayed out. Why why?
[20046.76s -> 20053.18s]  Has anybody figured that out yet?
[20053.18s -> 20055.74s]  Because there's a boss or a statue nearby really
[20057.94s -> 20093.27s]  What you're fucking kidding me, dude
[20093.27s -> 20099.74s]  Oh
[20108.60s -> 20113.53s]  Yeah, i'm talking about these I feel like this is just like kind of random times when you can't summon them
[20117.42s -> 20119.42s]  Kind of figure that that means
[20121.51s -> 20125.43s]  Okay, let's do this. This is what I wanted to do before before I got rudely interrupted
[20126.71s -> 20154.60s]  Fuck off already
[20156.22s -> 20175.78s]  Old man just sit on the ledge. I gotta get down. It's too hard to fight on the horse back here. I gotta just fight
[20176.58s -> 20214.44s]  I didn't do it. Oh, I didn't have any stamina. He broke it
[20224.66s -> 20227.80s]  Tried to jump inside
[20231.58s -> 20233.58s]  So wet
[20235.35s -> 20245.26s]  Like literally it's like I dumped my hand in the fucking sink like literally my hands are covered in fucking water
[20249.85s -> 20255.64s]  Jesus christ
[20255.64s -> 20258.20s]  There's a little stone spire nearby you can summon
[20259.24s -> 20262.38s]  There's a boss here
[20263.18s -> 20275.93s]  This is actually one of the only games where I would wear those like fingerless gamer gloves, you know
[20275.93s -> 20278.97s]  I mean the like biker. I want I want biker gloves
[20279.61s -> 20287.37s]  I'm gonna get them for next time
[20287.37s -> 20292.41s]  Like it would be embarrassing for me to shake somebody's hand right now. I would have to if it was no
[20292.41s -> 20295.05s]  No, no shake my hand right now jerma. It'd be like
[20295.69s -> 20302.78s]  I wouldn't do it
[20302.78s -> 20322.23s]  Racing gloves. Yeah
[20322.23s -> 20325.67s]  Is there anything on the it's not one of those map things I can get here, right?
[20326.15s -> 20342.52s]  Oh
[20347.32s -> 20363.51s]  Yep, yep, we found the the moon katana yet. I have not
[20366.17s -> 20378.58s]  We're gonna just keep going this way
[20379.22s -> 20391.06s]  I guess
[20391.06s -> 20400.55s]  dear any trouble we got
[20401.59s -> 20407.16s]  charm a pierced enemy or
[20408.12s -> 20417.08s]  You don't get very but you got a cool bow focus immunity now
[20419.34s -> 20425.11s]  I'll mark it because I should probably mark all these guys anyways
[20427.54s -> 20430.02s]  That's the merchant house, right? That's what i've been saying
[20435.70s -> 20464.23s]  Uh, okay. Yeah marking the merchants a good idea. Yeah
[20465.11s -> 20474.70s]  Okay, i'm gonna parry this fucking guy and i'm gonna stop being an embarrassing video game player
[20476.94s -> 20478.46s]  That begins now
[20478.46s -> 20489.80s]  Let's not parry on this
[20489.80s -> 20516.86s]  What else is down here? I gotta find a map fragment or something
[20517.58s -> 20532.02s]  Are you gonna cast a spell?
[20532.02s -> 20538.52s]  I feel like a lot of people are resistant to magic in this game. I feel like i'm running into all the places where they are
[20540.36s -> 20542.54s]  But i've been i've happened
[20543.34s -> 20556.54s]  I mean my weapon is intelligence. That's like the whole point right a little hut
[20560.17s -> 20561.91s]  All right. Give me a map
[20561.91s -> 20563.91s]  map fragment of some kind
[20564.31s -> 20571.48s]  Interesting. Where are we?
[20574.95s -> 20576.95s]  Have you tried cheese?
[20577.43s -> 20579.27s]  Formula cheese or whatever that is
[20579.27s -> 20583.88s]  Where is this?
[20583.88s -> 20585.88s]  ravine veiled village
[20586.36s -> 20598.68s]  I'm gonna go let's go up the map fragments are already on you. Yeah, usually they show up here
[20598.76s -> 20603.24s]  Like i'm looking for like that's one right there
[20603.80s -> 20606.10s]  I'm trying to see this one here
[20606.26s -> 20609.05s]  in this vicinity
[20609.05s -> 20610.87s]  Well shit
[20610.87s -> 20620.66s]  just go up
[20620.66s -> 20626.98s]  nothing, okay
[20626.98s -> 20628.34s]  for
[20628.34s -> 20629.62s]  romundo
[20629.62s -> 20631.26s]  I don't know what that is
[20631.26s -> 20637.85s]  Remember look like you look like you can't ride a bike
[20639.05s -> 20641.05s]  I mean I would get on and I would go like
[20641.90s -> 20650.92s]  Then I would straighten out and be fine
[20651.64s -> 20656.42s]  You're going
[20656.42s -> 20665.38s]  Try the new oreo shamrock with flurry. Is it good?
[20666.02s -> 20668.58s]  I feel like that's too much
[20668.58s -> 20680.20s]  That sounds like a lot
[20680.20s -> 20682.20s]  oreo shamrock
[20682.28s -> 20686.06s]  The shamrock flurry is kind of I don't know if i'm into it yet
[20690.33s -> 20693.69s]  It's kind of the first like two three sips is like, oh this is kind of good and then it's just like
[20694.90s -> 20696.90s]  Does it kind of feel like sludge?
[20698.97s -> 20701.61s]  It gets like that like sludge feeling like in the back of your mouth
[20704.66s -> 20707.38s]  It has way too much sugar. I think that's probably what it is
[20707.94s -> 20723.80s]  What's this guy doing? All right, i'll take the free kill. Why not?
[20731.29s -> 20732.17s]  poison
[20732.17s -> 20734.17s]  Oh, fuck you. It is poison. All right
[20736.46s -> 20740.22s]  Oh, this is a disaster. Okay. Uh, I think I have one of those things I need
[20740.86s -> 20750.18s]  It's rot, right?
[20750.18s -> 20751.46s]  It's not rot
[20751.46s -> 20753.46s]  What is it? It's wait what?
[20753.78s -> 20763.67s]  Poison do I not have anything that stops poison? I thought rot was poison. What the fuck is rot then?
[20767.16s -> 20769.72s]  Rot is different than poison. Um, I don't think I have anything
[20771.19s -> 20777.42s]  Can I craft something?
[20777.42s -> 20783.82s]  Blood loss cures rot buildup and it's not rot. I don't I don't have any I can't make any poison blocker thingy
[20785.40s -> 20790.74s]  Oh, well, you can outheal it rot is poison, but it's 10. Oh, okay. So rot is like the
[20791.78s -> 20807.64s]  How does that look man? What's that sleep?
[20809.18s -> 20811.82s]  These guys just throw like all the dust at you
[20813.56s -> 20815.56s]  I know hold on. I want to see what's down here
[20817.03s -> 20819.03s]  That was probably sleep. That was probably gonna be bad
[20819.35s -> 20837.03s]  And nothing can also make soap to reduce poison buildup before it's full
[20837.91s -> 20840.31s]  Can I wash it? No, I can't wash it off, right?
[20845.16s -> 20862.87s]  Um, that doesn't look like it not after it fills up wait this shit over there. Ah item
[20866.31s -> 20869.51s]  Remind me that that's there
[20870.07s -> 20895.91s]  I'm at a mana fuck
[20903.53s -> 20906.25s]  Cracked crystals, I don't think i've seen those before
[20907.21s -> 20924.89s]  Cracked crystal. Oh, that's not good
[20926.49s -> 20928.49s]  Lightning grease
[20928.73s -> 20931.70s]  My god guys, what the fuck slow down
[20932.58s -> 20935.34s]  You're gonna poison yourselves
[20936.78s -> 20952.66s]  In midair, okay lightning grease
[20953.46s -> 20963.43s]  It's down here. Oh, it's an exploder
[20964.31s -> 20973.11s]  We're good ruined strewn precipice
[20973.91s -> 20985.34s]  Okay, it was another way I could go in the cave. I think i'm gonna go back in the cave
[20989.70s -> 20991.54s]  Yeah, let's go back in the cave
[20991.54s -> 21000.25s]  There's something I did not explore in here
[21017.18s -> 21019.18s]  Yeah. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[21034.10s -> 21043.66s]  Oh watch it watch it watch it. Where the fuck did you come from?
[21058.95s -> 21065.74s]  Oh
[21065.74s -> 21073.08s]  What do you got?
[21073.08s -> 21075.64s]  Well, good. I replaced the one that I was a bonehead
[21079.91s -> 21081.91s]  The fucking thing into the dirt
[21081.91s -> 21089.02s]  Did I go everywhere?
[21089.02s -> 21092.57s]  Wait, there's that item that I wanted to get
[21092.57s -> 21104.12s]  On the elevator, let me get the item on the elevator
[21107.24s -> 21109.54s]  Which was there, right?
[21110.54s -> 21112.30s]  No, i'm an idiot
[21112.30s -> 21118.86s]  Right like here. Oh my god. It's not right there fucking come on, dude. Seriously. I thought I saw the light
[21121.34s -> 21125.18s]  I saw the light and I thought the light was the ledge. I was like, i'm not I don't want to miss it
[21125.99s -> 21130.68s]  It was way further down. It's right. It's okay. It's all right. It's right here
[21138.04s -> 21141.48s]  It's way lower. I saw the green light the green lantern thing
[21143.69s -> 21147.13s]  Wait, wait, what's going on? That's not what I want to do
[21147.29s -> 21148.89s]  What's going on here?
[21148.89s -> 21150.41s]  Wait, what's happening?
[21150.41s -> 21152.28s]  Why is that here?
[21152.28s -> 21154.28s]  Wait, what i'm confused
[21154.36s -> 21155.88s]  What's going on?
[21155.88s -> 21159.08s]  It was this cave. Yeah
[21159.64s -> 21160.60s]  Oh
[21160.60s -> 21184.73s]  We're good
[21184.73s -> 21200.54s]  Way higher
[21201.42s -> 21219.78s]  It looks like another way to go too. Yeah, I can't summon unless there's a boss or a statue nearby
[21219.86s -> 21221.86s]  That's it. I did not know that the whole time i'm playing
[21222.82s -> 21238.42s]  All right. Where is this fucking thing? Right here smithing stone. Very cool
[21238.90s -> 21251.96s]  I wish it was a six
[21251.96s -> 21256.25s]  Is that right?
[21256.25s -> 21267.16s]  Okay, that's it. So now, uh
[21268.20s -> 21272.10s]  Just go out
[21272.10s -> 21274.98s]  I want the souls. No problem
[21292.36s -> 21294.12s]  So now let's go over here
[21294.12s -> 21296.68s]  So should I go up or should I go?
[21297.40s -> 21300.06s]  Should I be here? Maybe I should just I wonder
[21301.66s -> 21307.51s]  What should I do? What should I do? Should I just go?
[21308.71s -> 21313.56s]  Should I go up?
[21313.56s -> 21318.58s]  I wonder if I should leave it just go
[21319.46s -> 21321.69s]  I don't know
[21321.69s -> 21325.88s]  There's two ways to go
[21325.88s -> 21329.80s]  I need them. Yeah, I also I need a map to fucking lost like this
[21349.28s -> 21361.48s]  10 000 souls. Don't be an idiot. I'm gonna go up. Was there something else that I could do here though? I feel like I could
[21366.58s -> 21371.42s]  But i'm just gonna go up
[21371.42s -> 21387.48s]  Yeah, this i'll i'll get it later
[21389.05s -> 21391.05s]  Not quite but i'll get there
[21413.05s -> 21443.08s]  Why did you turn it back? Uh, I see you up there you piece of shit land
[21443.64s -> 21463.82s]  Okay, did you drop where did the guy go? That guy where'd that guy go?

[21480.33s -> 21490.58s]  Jump over there
[21490.58s -> 21492.98s]  Somber smithing stone three. That's not what I want
[21493.78s -> 21516.14s]  Nothing over fine. Okay, that's it now. Let's go down
[21518.44s -> 21520.44s]  Fall fall fall fall
[21522.52s -> 21526.04s]  I don't want to lose this many souls. So i'm gonna say no to the fall joke
[21527.00s -> 21529.69s]  Sorry
[21529.69s -> 21534.06s]  Maybe some of it that was one person that said that
[21546.92s -> 21549.54s]  Yeah, the fuck am I even going?
[21550.18s -> 21555.70s]  Okay

[21644.81s -> 21652.10s]  You and me

[21654.74s -> 21672.52s]  Nice get over here
[21674.58s -> 21699.38s]  Uh, uh, oh, that's a big ruin. That's a huge one. Come on. I don't have sand
[21702.07s -> 21709.43s]  Uh, I don't think I ever got it six is uh, just 2,500. I can definitely level up now then
[21709.91s -> 21724.82s]  I knew it. I knew you were gonna show up
[21724.90s -> 21729.96s]  I just better get knocked off
[21730.44s -> 21753.10s]  I'm too nervous to go that way
[21753.18s -> 21760.78s]  Let me scale them out
[21762.78s -> 21773.34s]  There's gonna be some asshole up here. I know it
[21774.02s -> 21776.82s]  I'm gonna get to the top and it's gonna be a boss and i'm gonna kick its ass

[21934.57s -> 21936.57s]  You wouldn't even live another single second of your life
[21938.20s -> 21943.16s]  You're lucky I don't have a mana potion you piece of crap you're lucky I don't have fucking flask
[21944.81s -> 21973.88s]  Get the fuck over here
[21973.88s -> 21980.47s]  I got it. I got it. That was kind of horrible
[21986.90s -> 21989.34s]  Okay, i'm glad I can at least replace some of those
[21990.14s -> 21993.38s]  I would have felt very
[21993.46s -> 22013.93s]  Over there. It's a big scary octopus thing. Let me check it out. I don't even think about it
[22014.01s -> 22028.98s]  I know what you're gonna do
[22029.22s -> 22054.18s]  You're not gonna kill me. Okay. Well, okay

[22114.07s -> 22121.83s]  See you later. Bye
[22121.83s -> 22130.95s]  You missed a smithing stone. I ain't going back up there for that. No, thank you
[22131.51s -> 22146.14s]  Continue going up. There's a fry on a flog on a log

[22151.50s -> 22153.99s]  On the bog on the bottom of the seat

[22158.07s -> 22168.04s]  That's probably a boss up here
[22168.04s -> 22172.90s]  I need 17
[22172.90s -> 22178.17s]  17 what?
[22178.17s -> 22185.22s]  I'm definitely I gotta put points in health. It's it's getting pretty ugly
[22186.02s -> 22191.53s]  Do it without leaning forward. There's uh
[22192.33s -> 22195.29s]  A lee on the hair on the dog on the frog on the bog on the log at the bottom of the seat
[22205.99s -> 22215.93s]  Yep. All right, let's go. Who's there?
[22216.65s -> 22233.74s]  magma worm maker
[22234.50s -> 22241.48s]  He makes magma worms
[22243.32s -> 22259.74s]  Sorry, I've sneezed I those have been bothering me
[22265.00s -> 22267.56s]  I have fire resistance stuff on down. I can get some fire resistance stuff
[22270.74s -> 22272.74s]  Fire this one's 12
[22281.74s -> 22286.58s]  I want to keep this on right?
[22286.58s -> 22298.67s]  Fire anything better. I know I have a fire resistance shield. Okay, this is 49
[22300.57s -> 22302.33s]  59
[22302.33s -> 22304.33s]  Oh, I can't put it on. Okay
[22307.14s -> 22308.18s]  28
[22308.18s -> 22310.46s]  Okay, i'm gonna have to use
[22310.46s -> 22316.90s]  This one. Okay, let's try it again
[22318.23s -> 22321.19s]  So he just runs around and has a bunch of fire all over him
[22321.99s -> 22325.03s]  So I gotta wait don't go in yet. Just kind of let him do his thing
[22325.99s -> 22328.36s]  Are you how do you how do you feel about the sorcerer?
[22329.16s -> 22339.03s]  Not bad
[22339.03s -> 22340.71s]  very slow
[22340.71s -> 22342.86s]  What about melee?
[22342.86s -> 22348.10s]  Hey, my melee is way better against him. I let him do his thing
[22348.98s -> 22360.20s]  On a site with a pillar maybe
[22360.20s -> 22377.78s]  Oh, get out
[22378.10s -> 22383.86s]  Oh that reach
[22383.86s -> 22388.41s]  All right around the pillow. Let's go. Go. Go. Go. Go
[22389.37s -> 22398.87s]  It's low and steady
[22398.87s -> 22407.64s]  Oh get him under the water
[22407.64s -> 22409.67s]  It's genius
[22409.67s -> 22435.40s]  Watch that fire dude. Don't be an idiot
[22443.50s -> 22445.50s]  Holy shit, he went all the way around
[22489.42s -> 22521.22s]  I don't know where the fuck I just was
[22521.46s -> 22552.68s]  Fuck that's so long
[22552.68s -> 22591.08s]  If i'm on that pillar, I don't like it when you're over here
[22619.46s -> 22638.90s]  Get rid of the fire. He's gonna do his little bullshit move where he spins
[22683.78s -> 22685.78s]  What no
[22685.94s -> 22687.94s]  One fucking hit what?
[22689.35s -> 22693.18s]  No way
[22693.18s -> 22699.03s]  What?
[22699.03s -> 22701.11s]  Oh, I fucking dodged right through it
[22701.99s -> 22703.99s]  Damn it, man. I
[22708.31s -> 22710.31s]  I fucking had it right there, too
[22710.55s -> 22712.79s]  God, what's with the fucking instant kill bullshit?
[22715.58s -> 22717.82s]  I fucking had it. Oh my god
[22719.11s -> 22721.11s]  What a fucking goddamn eye roll
[22732.04s -> 22742.66s]  It looked like I dodged right through it, too
[22743.54s -> 22766.65s]  Not as short
[22771.80s -> 22773.80s]  I need like 10 more points
[22774.04s -> 22802.22s]  Seriously bad again with this bullshit
[22803.10s -> 22850.94s]  I'm so fucking annoyed. I can't believe I didn't want to kill him out of the fire
[22851.74s -> 22872.73s]  The camera maybe dodged backwards
[22884.17s -> 22887.94s]  Out of the fire out out of the fire
[22906.23s -> 22957.54s]  I don't dodge into it this time. Oh this fire there this fire over there
[22958.26s -> 22981.98s]  You can see
[22981.98s -> 22986.22s]  Dude, I fucking didn't what the fuck I can't see
[22987.18s -> 22991.91s]  Like I apparently I queued up a heel and I just I didn't have the animation time to dodge
[22996.55s -> 22997.99s]  God damn it
[22997.99s -> 22999.99s]  Okay, oleg's got to come out at second phase
[23000.47s -> 23007.27s]  It's just like when I dodged I I guess I pressed x and it just queues up the heel when you get up
[23007.43s -> 23009.43s]  And I was just fucked at that point
[23016.44s -> 23018.44s]  And that move kills you in one hit
[23018.52s -> 23025.69s]  All right, oleg comes out at phase two
[23026.09s -> 23056.58s]  Really? Oh you piece of garbage
[23057.38s -> 23083.93s]  I might reset
[23084.17s -> 23089.45s]  I
[23089.45s -> 23092.65s]  Yeah, I got I burnt through two flasks in the first 15 seconds. I gotta reset
[23099.83s -> 23102.39s]  Use the summon. I'm waiting for phase two, dude
[23103.19s -> 23104.39s]  phase two
[23104.39s -> 23106.39s]  He dies instantly in the fire here
[23128.74s -> 23130.98s]  You're gonna do it back to fucking time. Really?
[23133.86s -> 23136.18s]  Uh, I didn't mean to press x twice. I'm full tailed
[23183.22s -> 23186.10s]  You're not gonna do it three times. All right. Oh, you've got
[23217.64s -> 23246.66s]  Slides for a dick. He's going here. We go
[23246.66s -> 23252.01s]  Phase two, let's go. Go get him oleg
[23253.21s -> 23279.00s]  Come on, my boy
[23279.00s -> 23301.66s]  Oleg's no good here
[23302.94s -> 23311.13s]  That whole I can't even go to the whole right side
[23311.45s -> 23332.30s]  Come here. God damn it. I got yeah
[23333.34s -> 23374.66s]  God fucking damn it. I'm in fire too
[23377.22s -> 23380.42s]  Oh my god, fuck. Oh fuck me. No
[23381.46s -> 23382.90s]  Oh fuck
[23382.90s -> 23384.26s]  Oh fuck
[23384.26s -> 23385.86s]  Oh fuck
[23385.86s -> 23387.86s]  He caught me again
[23388.60s -> 23390.76s]  Oh fuck. Oh fuck
[23394.54s -> 23396.22s]  Fuck
[23396.22s -> 23398.22s]  Oh fuck
[23404.34s -> 23405.46s]  Shit
[23405.46s -> 23407.96s]  Porn sounds
[23407.96s -> 23410.52s]  Uh, it's just if he catches you with that but like trying to bait
[23411.85s -> 23413.85s]  Trying to bait out that attack
[23413.85s -> 23416.73s]  You get in and he swings three times. The third time is the horrible one
[23417.45s -> 23419.45s]  When you get in close to bait it
[23419.61s -> 23424.01s]  It's like you can't it's like look at it's like I feel like i'm gonna fall over
[23424.57s -> 23427.50s]  Like looking up at a fucking giant statue
[23436.30s -> 23442.02s]  That's the camera is your enemy in this game because when you're locked on you just your eyes are just pointing like this
[23442.02s -> 23444.26s]  I'm just like, okay. What when is he coming down?
[23448.06s -> 23449.34s]  Let's do this
[23449.34s -> 23458.55s]  Try this. I feel like there's a lot of time. I might be able to actually get one of these off
[23458.55s -> 23460.39s]  I wonder how much damage this does
[23460.39s -> 23478.70s]  I don't actually a lot but it takes a while
[23505.90s -> 23506.86s]  Nope
[23506.86s -> 23508.38s]  Oh takes too long
[23508.38s -> 23511.24s]  Takes too long takes too long
[23511.24s -> 23535.54s]  Doesn't really do enough damage either
[23544.70s -> 23549.46s]  Fuck on he really is gonna get stuck there
[23550.42s -> 23574.70s]  You guys can't shoot
[23574.70s -> 23586.01s]  Oh boy. No, no, no, no
[23586.65s -> 23589.85s]  I get caught sometimes he does it like three times in a row
[23593.06s -> 23595.22s]  Yeah, the magic's not the magic's not gonna cut it
[23596.86s -> 23598.86s]  Maybe at the end if I could stay back
[23608.39s -> 23618.22s]  Oh my god top to clean the front
[23636.46s -> 23650.86s]  This is a sloppy one
[23650.86s -> 23652.22s]  sloppy one
[23652.22s -> 23659.64s]  All right, so he's trying to see if he like
[23660.60s -> 23662.84s]  That's a sloppy one
[23662.84s -> 23664.52s]  How much damage is this?
[23664.52s -> 23677.00s]  I think it's time for jump r2s on this guy
[23678.14s -> 23694.23s]  But it'd be hard to do because he can't dodge through that is he gonna get hit by the hitbox that lasts?
[23695.19s -> 23721.67s]  Well, just practice
[23723.50s -> 23725.10s]  He's still alive
[23725.10s -> 23750.57s]  I just don't know where the fuck I am
[23756.42s -> 23761.22s]  Like he puts his hands all the way over his head. So even looking up. It's like I can't see his fucking arms
[23770.50s -> 23773.45s]  All right last try last try
[23774.25s -> 23780.79s]  Last try and then i'm gonna go eat some food. I need to eat something. I need to eat food
[23783.11s -> 23785.11s]  I have to come back refreshed
[23811.58s -> 23815.98s]  I waited so fucking long too. My god you guys take an eternity to do moves in this game
[23846.01s -> 23847.77s]  I knew you were gonna do that
[23847.77s -> 23863.11s]  Damn it. I tried to dodge through it again. It didn't do it
[23863.91s -> 23866.92s]  Can't dodge through that when he puts it in his mouth
[23867.40s -> 23921.43s]  No, whoa
[23921.43s -> 23922.39s]  Really?
[23922.39s -> 23950.39s]  Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye
[23975.51s -> 23977.59s]  Where the fuck am I come on?
[23978.23s -> 23980.95s]  Dude, what the fuck man?
[23981.67s -> 24036.26s]  That's a bad idea man. This is my friend
[24069.85s -> 24071.85s]  Dude, what the fuck am I?
[24072.47s -> 24073.85s]  seriously
[24073.85s -> 24134.18s]  Oh
[24134.18s -> 24138.26s]  Dude, I fucking it's so annoying. Like I just don't know where the fuck even is
[24139.93s -> 24143.69s]  Walking on not walking on his hands go all the way into the air into the ceiling
[24161.02s -> 24163.02s]  Get away from me you fucker
[24164.60s -> 24167.82s]  You fucker
[24167.82s -> 24201.42s]  You motherfucker
[24201.42s -> 24217.53s]  Eat cheese for breakfast you fucking piece of shit. You're gonna get diarrhea in the fucking morning. I guarantee it
[24234.81s -> 24235.93s]  No
[24235.93s -> 24240.28s]  Oh, oh no. I'm running out of juice
[24257.66s -> 24259.66s]  Fuck you. Stop missing
[24260.46s -> 24267.91s]  Goddamn it
[24267.91s -> 24270.07s]  I'm playing this so fucking safe. You have no idea
[24270.71s -> 24273.74s]  You're gonna give me the cheese hall of fame for this one
[24276.30s -> 24282.10s]  What? Oh shit. What does this weapon power do?
[24328.38s -> 24331.29s]  Fuck you game
[24331.29s -> 24333.29s]  I'm gonna smoke that cheese all the way to the bank
[24334.65s -> 24336.57s]  Oh my god
[24336.57s -> 24342.52s]  That was so scary
[24342.52s -> 24344.52s]  I would I cheesed him, but we know what whatever
[24345.16s -> 24352.57s]  What was that?
[24352.57s -> 24366.82s]  Agma worm scale sword d scaling agma guillotine
[24368.73s -> 24372.04s]  What? Let's see
[24372.60s -> 24378.06s]  But I need
[24378.06s -> 24388.41s]  Wait, I have to sit down
[24388.97s -> 24392.27s]  It's not cheese. Well, I I I 50 percent
[24396.36s -> 24397.88s]  What the hell
[24397.96s -> 24406.28s]  That's actually kind of cool. All right. I mean I I didn't really cheese him I
[24407.24s -> 24415.02s]  Pursued him correctly and I killed him. All right, let me level up and then um, let me think about eating something
[24415.66s -> 24423.91s]  Some of the moves are follow-up moves
[24424.23s -> 24446.02s]  Fire is supposed to come out. Maybe I can't I can't wield it
[24448.62s -> 24452.52s]  I'm trying to do a bunch of combinations
[24455.35s -> 24459.11s]  Yeah, I don't know. I I think I think it's a twitch problem because this has been happening consistently all night
[24462.09s -> 24465.85s]  I this is not an internet problem. Somebody said that other people are having problems, too
[24467.27s -> 24477.43s]  Yeah, I don't meet the requirements to use it. All right. So what what else is over here? What else is before I stop?
[24478.39s -> 24491.78s]  Let's check out over here
[24491.78s -> 24502.01s]  All right. So the plan is i'm probably gonna I want to try to kill that goddamn guy. All right. Here's the plan
[24502.89s -> 24506.09s]  I'm gonna give it like three attempts to go fight that other dude
[24507.45s -> 24518.22s]  We've got rep again. I'm gonna go try. Okay. I've got more flasks. I've got more health. I've got more everything
[24524.34s -> 24536.74s]  I'm gonna let me try it first. Let me atlas plateau. Okay, this is really pretty
[24540.90s -> 24544.02s]  Did I get me six smithing stones? I don't think I did
[24546.23s -> 24548.15s]  This is four
[24548.15s -> 24555.64s]  All right. Uh, let me just touch the bonfire here. There's probably one right here somewhere
[24556.60s -> 24569.62s]  There's okay. All right. I'm not gonna do this area. Not yet
[24570.34s -> 24573.46s]  What i'm gonna do is i'm gonna i'm gonna go check it out
[24574.34s -> 24576.74s]  See if I can do it reliably in like one or two attempts
[24577.46s -> 24596.36s]  Then i'm gonna stop stream i'm gonna eat and i'll be back tomorrow I think can I level anything up?
[24597.80s -> 24609.59s]  I did have a lot of those uh crushes. Yeah, I think I actually might be able to get there
[24611.40s -> 24615.10s]  Four thousand i'll be close
[24618.06s -> 24632.63s]  I need a little bit more. All right, let me just get i'll kill some people. Is there people out here like right here?
[24633.19s -> 24635.19s]  Just people like yeah, we're gonna go to the farming zone
[24643.80s -> 24652.36s]  Just enough to get I want to get vitality up another point
[24652.84s -> 24654.84s]  I'm trying to get I want to get like 25 or 30
[24654.84s -> 24669.75s]  You're like 18 000
[24669.75s -> 24679.42s]  Like that. All right. All right
[24686.20s -> 24688.20s]  Knocked me off my fucking horse
[24688.20s -> 24699.53s]  Oh, you don't even move that far get out of here
[24710.15s -> 24712.15s]  There's 14
[24717.30s -> 24719.30s]  Any headphones in because of being a dumbass
[24722.14s -> 24745.64s]  Ow
[24745.64s -> 24747.34s]  Stop it
[24747.34s -> 24771.66s]  Oh my god, they weren't even trying to kill me. They got me
[24772.46s -> 24806.31s]  All right. What am I needing now? I need like a thousand two thousand one or two more of these dogs will do it. I think
[24806.79s -> 24811.19s]  Let's go ahead and just make this easy on ourselves. Why don't we?
[24828.95s -> 24859.56s]  Back up back up back up run away. Whoa easy
[24860.28s -> 24863.88s]  Who the fuck are you?
[24863.88s -> 24867.24s]  Okay, we're almost there
[24867.24s -> 24868.92s]  Almost there
[24868.92s -> 24875.91s]  Put on your old uh gear. Yeah, that's a good point. That's a very good point
[24878.10s -> 24881.82s]  Let's just respawn everybody one more time
[24881.82s -> 24885.90s]  All right, we're giving it three attempts. That's it. I promise three attempts and that's it
[24889.45s -> 24894.17s]  I'm just gonna do the thing. I was doing before i'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna I got some extra levels
[24894.97s -> 24898.62s]  I can't do it. I'll i'll do it again another time
[24903.27s -> 24936.09s]  Okay, I think i'm there
[24936.09s -> 24938.07s]  I don't want to get too many
[24938.07s -> 24941.46s]  Yeah, i'm definitely all right. Let's go
[24942.02s -> 24956.14s]  I'm still getting chased
[24956.14s -> 24962.09s]  All right. Here we go. Let's give it a few tries. I'm only gonna try it a few times. I'm not gonna do anything stupid
[24962.73s -> 24971.16s]  Are you ready?
[24971.16s -> 24972.36s]  We good
[24972.36s -> 24976.90s]  I gotta change my flasks
[24977.06s -> 24980.95s]  Because what does that he he what man what kind of damage is he doing?
[24983.30s -> 24985.70s]  Very nice. Just think I think it's good all around
[24986.65s -> 24988.15s]  Would it be like
[24988.15s -> 24989.37s]  slashing
[24989.37s -> 24991.21s]  He has magic too though
[24991.21s -> 24995.37s]  He has that like wave of magic
[24997.21s -> 25009.19s]  Hmm
[25009.19s -> 25012.65s]  Uh, i'll put the these are good
[25014.58s -> 25016.18s]  Something drilling right? Yep
[25016.18s -> 25018.50s]  Yeah, that's good
[25018.50s -> 25023.14s]  Potency of sorceries restores hp. Do I have any like lightning damage?
[25023.86s -> 25026.55s]  Holy damage or something reduction
[25026.95s -> 25030.26s]  I think that's good
[25030.26s -> 25037.62s]  Okay, here we go. Are you okay? Um, yeah, i'm fine. The game's hard and frustrating
[25042.89s -> 25043.77s]  All right
[25043.77s -> 25045.77s]  Three attempts and then i'm calling it tonight
[25046.01s -> 25062.90s]  And then we'll come back to it probably tomorrow. I need to get some food through the dragon powers. We'll we'll do that tomorrow
[25063.38s -> 25074.68s]  I just want to see if I can get get this done. Sometimes you beat him on your first try. I mean
[25075.64s -> 25077.29s]  I'm still
[25077.29s -> 25079.29s]  I'm still gonna probably leave
[25084.79s -> 25090.20s]  Can I open these?
[25090.20s -> 25093.40s]  Uh, wait, what's going on?
[25093.48s -> 25095.91s]  Uh, do I have to say yes to him? I do don't I?
[25096.47s -> 25106.74s]  All right, everybody I need total silence for this
[25109.75s -> 25111.75s]  I need complete 100 total silence
[25112.15s -> 25117.43s]  We must make merry if anybody does a chat message. I'll hear it and it'll freak me out
[25121.91s -> 25123.91s]  No chatting no messages
[25124.98s -> 25130.81s]  done three attempts
[25130.81s -> 25165.29s]  Let's go
[25165.29s -> 25257.42s]  Oh fuck everybody get in. All right, let's go find some more summoning signs. Is that too far away? Nope
[25257.98s -> 25286.33s]  I need those signs right now, please
[25315.22s -> 25414.65s]  Where are the other ones here somewhere where's the meteor he falls away from me brand get him away
[25426.94s -> 25432.02s]  I need more summons. Where are they? I gotta go find them. It's only like three people there
[25434.50s -> 25449.10s]  They up on the top of the hill. Let's go
[25449.66s -> 25469.70s]  I don't know the hell that was but I don't want to be part of that
[25470.42s -> 25484.63s]  All right, there's one down there. All right, let's go see if I can get a couple hits
[25485.75s -> 25504.66s]  Where is it? Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
[25505.54s -> 25539.96s]  Oh man, here they go
[25540.12s -> 25543.96s]  What hit me I got like two of them
[25544.90s -> 25549.26s]  What?
[25549.26s -> 25557.82s]  Aye, aye, dude
[25557.82s -> 25559.98s]  All right. Well, this is a major problem. I'm already seeing here
[25560.98s -> 25565.86s]  Here's the here's the huge problem. I should not have seven fucking flasks. This is
[25566.50s -> 25568.87s]  a huge problem
[25568.87s -> 25576.89s]  It's a big problem
[25576.89s -> 25580.17s]  Uh, two healing potions. I should not be hit more than one or two times ever
[25580.81s -> 25592.63s]  Try it again one hits. Are you gonna get one shot?
[25593.43s -> 25594.87s]  Yeah, I
[25595.32s -> 25599.64s]  It's I it's weird because sometimes he gets into range and they don't attack me
[25600.28s -> 25604.52s]  They just kind of still sit there. I wonder what the actual timing is on having them actually attack
[25605.08s -> 25607.40s]  Sometimes it just feels kind of random
[25608.20s -> 25610.20s]  Because i'll be close to him and he won't nothing
[25610.60s -> 25612.60s]  the npcs
[25612.60s -> 25614.60s]  We're all over them and they weren't firing
[25617.03s -> 25621.59s]  Shouldn't even need to take one healing potion. Yeah, but you know, i'm gonna take two
[25625.62s -> 25628.10s]  Oh my god, I have to say
[25628.10s -> 25631.35s]  Yes to him again
[25631.35s -> 25633.35s]  Be sure if you get too far away
[25633.75s -> 25635.83s]  I mean, I sometimes i'm across the whole map
[25642.01s -> 25644.57s]  But now they don't fire if you're in melee range
[25647.35s -> 25653.48s]  Accurate he roars. That's how you know, he does it really
[25662.30s -> 25664.70s]  Do I have the right armor? I don't really have anything else. That's better
[25665.26s -> 25669.42s]  Like the carrion knight stuff, which is just kind of generally just good all around
[25670.30s -> 25675.50s]  You should use a rune arc for this. All right, i'm gonna use a rune arc and hopefully it doesn't come back and bite me in the ass
[25675.50s -> 25677.50s]  I'm using one right now
[25677.98s -> 25681.10s]  All right, if I die immediately to this first thing i'm gonna
[25682.30s -> 25684.14s]  I'm gonna be very upset
[25684.14s -> 25692.01s]  Okay, here we go. This is the one. This is actually the one we're gonna do it right here. This is the one
[25692.09s -> 25694.09s]  I'm this is copium and that's fine
[25694.33s -> 25737.66s]  I thought it was gonna hit me
[25737.66s -> 25740.94s]  and
[25740.94s -> 25742.86s]  What the fuck?
[25742.86s -> 25746.31s]  bro
[25746.31s -> 25748.23s]  Okay, bro
[25748.23s -> 25750.23s]  What are you fucking doing?
[25771.00s -> 25833.98s]  Are you fucking
[25834.46s -> 25851.75s]  Are you still alive up there? Who's even alive up there? I thought he was still alive
[25853.27s -> 25900.17s]  Okay, sorry
[25900.17s -> 25902.65s]  Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Where is he going?
[25907.90s -> 25910.22s]  I don't know which way he went. I don't know which way he went
[25911.02s -> 25916.71s]  We're good. I actually have no idea where the fuck he is
[25917.35s -> 25935.46s]  All right, dude, I don't know. I don't know
[25935.78s -> 25941.86s]  I'm not in melee range and they're not firing at me though
[25942.58s -> 25953.58s]  Why they're not firing? Let's say if you're if you're in not in melee range remember it was
[25954.38s -> 25967.38s]  Or if I get in melee range what happens I don't understand I'm fucked they only fire during certain moves
[25972.09s -> 25973.45s]  My god
[25973.45s -> 25981.26s]  Do I have to get off the horse?
[25982.54s -> 25984.90s]  Jesus
[25984.90s -> 25988.17s]  fucking hell man
[25988.25s -> 25993.85s]  Even if I didn't look at chat like I why did you stop shooting because I it's it's you stand so still
[25995.64s -> 25997.64s]  Roll them. I i'm on the horse
[25998.52s -> 26001.02s]  Get off the horse and roll them
[26002.23s -> 26005.75s]  Is that like worth getting off the horse and just like just sitting there and waiting till he fires them
[26006.47s -> 26027.80s]  I lost the ruinarc. I I I can't use a ruinarc until I get that down because like I just still don't understand
[26028.84s -> 26031.59s]  Is it just get off the horse?
[26031.75s -> 26039.18s]  I don't even know what the timing's like either
[26039.42s -> 26065.62s]  Shit my horse. How long does it take for the horse to respawn?
[26066.34s -> 26067.70s]  Without a heal
[26067.70s -> 26073.46s]  I'm hitting him with a fucking stab
[26075.74s -> 26076.78s]  Doesn't
[26076.78s -> 26078.66s]  That's not good
[26078.66s -> 26094.06s]  So i'm gonna get off the horse and i'm gonna dodge those things
[26094.78s -> 26098.57s]  Christ
[26098.57s -> 26138.17s]  Too far away, I think
[26138.49s -> 26159.62s]  Did I get it? I have no idea. I think so. They appear together
[26160.26s -> 26168.98s]  Let's fucking summon everybody. Whatever. Well, he's not gonna despawn
[26169.94s -> 26233.61s]  What the fuck you're coming for me still that's not cool
[26234.57s -> 26240.52s]  What do I do to you leave me alone?
[26240.68s -> 26255.61s]  Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right move move men
[26256.81s -> 26308.68s]  All right, get off the horse
[26308.68s -> 26323.02s]  Huh? Oh fuck
[26327.30s -> 26331.72s]  Oh
[26336.92s -> 26339.32s]  I can't get on the horse fast enough afterwards, dude
[26341.77s -> 26343.05s]  Oh like
[26343.05s -> 26347.48s]  Of course you have to do that move
[26347.48s -> 26354.38s]  Get back on the horse. Yeah, I it takes three or four seconds
[26356.41s -> 26360.49s]  Stay on the horse and dodge the meatballs. Can you though? I feel like they're homing missiles
[26361.13s -> 26369.46s]  fucking sorcery, man
[26369.46s -> 26371.53s]  Horse mount has eye frames
[26371.53s -> 26376.89s]  Could I theoretically okay, could I theoretically get on the horse when he shoots them?
[26379.27s -> 26386.38s]  Probably could right at least a second maybe I think that's the play
[26389.77s -> 26391.85s]  Dude I in the fucking heart was just kill me
[26392.81s -> 26397.29s]  It's so frustrating. It's like dude, like does it have to go home to my body going that fast?
[26397.69s -> 26413.32s]  Like I was trying to get it to hit the fucking thing hopping on the horse as the rolling eye frames
[26413.88s -> 26415.40s]  i'm gonna try to
[26415.40s -> 26417.40s]  dodge the first one
[26417.64s -> 26419.08s]  and then
[26419.08s -> 26423.88s]  Get on the horse when he shoots the second one that should do it and that should be it
[26423.88s -> 26435.05s]  That should be the one that should literally be the one. Oh, yeah, i'm i'm done after this. I would love to beat him
[26435.85s -> 26438.97s]  Do this bullshit tomorrow because I don't ever want to fucking fight this guy again
[26439.69s -> 26442.12s]  I'll put game charles in
[26442.44s -> 26466.36s]  And like skip this boss on my next play for you. You're not gonna do it again. Are you?
[26467.00s -> 26468.60s]  Yes, you are
[26468.60s -> 26483.10s]  All right, let's go
[26483.10s -> 26485.10s]  I got really screwed on the first few hours, too
[26485.74s -> 26556.49s]  I'm gonna start so i'm gonna stop and we're gonna move here
[26557.45s -> 26561.86s]  Come on, where are you at over here?
[26562.10s -> 26566.02s]  Where are they?
[26566.02s -> 26568.02s]  Oh, come on. Where are you?
[26568.02s -> 26570.02s]  Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you there?
[26587.94s -> 26650.97s]  Whoa more over here
[26651.21s -> 26653.85s]  Egads, I mean that's the egads like seriously
[26654.49s -> 26662.17s]  There he goes. He's going up
[26678.44s -> 26703.26s]  Every time I scream doesn't matter. Okay. Oh shit. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go
[26703.34s -> 26704.62s]  Here we go. Here we go. Here we go
[26704.62s -> 26722.44s]  I think I can jump
[26722.52s -> 26724.52s]  Oh fuck he's coming for me
[26725.24s -> 26749.82s]  Don't work. Don't work. Don't work. You gotta
[26750.46s -> 26752.46s]  Dodge dodge call don't work
[26757.45s -> 26760.71s]  You have to attack him
[26760.71s -> 26763.27s]  I I know but I want to get summons
[26770.26s -> 26775.94s]  That second phase is so hard for this character because I have I don't i'm not I don't have that many points in like melee
[26776.74s -> 26785.77s]  I mean I i'm getting up in there, but then like the meatballs are gonna fire this guy just is fucking hell
[26793.18s -> 26795.18s]  Maybe I need more like endurance or something. I don't know
[26807.69s -> 26809.69s]  My ass
[26811.37s -> 26816.92s]  Are you gonna are you gonna do that shit again you're gonna fire you're gonna do it again, of course you are
[26818.23s -> 26849.43s]  Why would you do anything else? I didn't even summon these guys either. I can't even get fucking close
[26849.83s -> 26851.67s]  Like this next to so
[26851.67s -> 26854.55s]  I can't how how do I approach him?
[26855.19s -> 26857.56s]  Like I was gonna go and do melee attacks
[26857.96s -> 26862.86s]  It's like a fucking god fucking hell
[26863.66s -> 26879.83s]  Okay, I gotta stick with the same strategy because like honest to god
[26880.55s -> 26882.55s]  Melee might be a good idea
[26883.42s -> 26889.10s]  But hear me out. I fought this guy for four fucking hours and I have I have no idea what those timings are
[26889.82s -> 26891.90s]  I have to try to beat him the way with i'm doing the sorcery
[26894.60s -> 26897.88s]  It's probably like I could probably do it. Right, but he's on the horse though
[26897.88s -> 26900.04s]  I feel like he's moving around so much faster than you could
[26900.84s -> 26902.84s]  How do you close the gap if you do melee?
[26903.00s -> 26905.00s]  Just horse melee
[26905.08s -> 26912.25s]  I don't know like that's hard
[26935.88s -> 26937.88s]  Yeah, go forward on that
[26937.96s -> 26951.69s]  I gotta get at least one more decent attack before I call it. Yeah patches doesn't do anything. I don't why why am I even summoning patches?
[26951.69s -> 26953.69s]  He's a fucking piece of shit. It didn't do anything
[26954.17s -> 26962.70s]  Let's try I I gotta get at least I gotta get one more solid attempt
[27067.38s -> 27073.86s]  Somebody's gotta somebody's got a fucking backstab on what holy shit somebody just saved the day. All right, relax relax relax
[27073.86s -> 27075.06s]  Relax, where do I go?
[27075.06s -> 27076.89s]  Where does he come from?
[27076.89s -> 27078.89s]  Where does he come from? Where does he go? Where does he come from? Where does he go?
[27079.37s -> 27084.04s]  Where does he come from? Where does he go? There he is
[27092.47s -> 27095.69s]  Oh fucking come on not i'm not immediately
[27101.38s -> 27106.10s]  I need summons too. Oh, i'm in deep trouble now. Come on. Do it now. Let me dodge him both and get on the horse quick
[27106.98s -> 27115.03s]  You had to do that. I couldn't
[27115.51s -> 27126.87s]  It's fine. It's fine. Oh you fucking gotta be kidding me
[27128.18s -> 27132.65s]  Do it do the move, please do the move, please do the move
[27148.23s -> 27150.58s]  Asshole do it
[27150.58s -> 27152.58s]  Is that it? That's not it
[27262.58s -> 27291.56s]  What kill him
[27291.56s -> 27293.56s]  Oh
[27312.36s -> 27329.08s]  That was too hard it was too much I don't like that one i'm not doing that anymore
[27329.88s -> 27333.66s]  I'm not gonna play that one anymore. That was too hard
[27334.55s -> 27360.17s]  Too hard for me. I think i've i've done it. I look like shit man. I've looked like shit this whole fucking day

[27389.88s -> 27392.92s]  This guy's been live for seven and a half hours streaming upside down
[27395.64s -> 27397.82s]  Damn
[27397.82s -> 27407.72s]  Oh, that was fucking horrible. What a sick way to fight the glory of the clashes shared by radon
[27408.20s -> 27416.33s]  No, that guy was an asshole. I saw that was there was no glory in that afterwards falling star right before our own father
[27416.49s -> 27418.65s]  My radon was holding back something of that scale
[27419.29s -> 27421.29s]  He was a living legend if ever I saw one
[27421.93s -> 27424.41s]  And the path has now been cleared to nokla
[27425.14s -> 27427.14s]  Irani's fate would be decided
[27427.22s -> 27429.22s]  Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth
[27430.02s -> 27432.58s]  We'll take up our souls once more. You should get some food

[27489.14s -> 27492.31s]  Oddly stand to face one such as you
[27494.60s -> 27496.28s]  You did good pot
[27496.28s -> 27498.60s]  I want to know don't you think i've given up who?
[27499.08s -> 27501.08s]  Parried him
[27504.04s -> 27506.76s]  This whole stream, I don't know who it was
[27508.60s -> 27514.36s]  Somebody parried him mighty warrior again in no time like which one of you dickheads did that the body's found here
[27514.60s -> 27519.98s]  Who could expect any less? I want to look back and see who did that shattering
[27524.15s -> 27527.51s]  Just you wait and see friend i'll grow even stronger
[27528.41s -> 27532.81s]  Just you wait when next we meet we should be friends. I don't want to fight anybody anymore
[27532.89s -> 27537.13s]  Can't we can I just like go ahead i'll throw in the towel and just like kind of watch the rest of the time
[27539.50s -> 27544.06s]  Here like you just take my staff and i'll just like ride on your back and just you play and
[27544.70s -> 27546.70s]  Whatever. Yeah, you can be the elden lord. It's like this
[27547.34s -> 27552.06s]  It's it's way too much stress. You know what I mean? Like I did my I killed uh radan
[27553.19s -> 27555.75s]  When we did I know i'm taking credit for that which is kind of fucked up
[27555.83s -> 27560.15s]  That body's found who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the shattering
[27560.79s -> 27562.79s]  the greatest of all wars
[27562.87s -> 27563.75s]  Okay
[27563.75s -> 27565.75s]  Just you wait and just you wait
[27566.55s -> 27569.67s]  So i'm good. So let's activate this i'm gonna level up and then i'll see you tomorrow
[27573.64s -> 27583.32s]  He's too old from software anymore sage. He's too old for from software what?
[27584.44s -> 27588.97s]  This fight is so hard
[27588.97s -> 27592.65s]  It's just so much. It's like when you your brain like knows what you have to do
[27593.69s -> 27598.97s]  You just won't it won't do it and then I just want I I so badly wanted my brain to do certain things
[27600.26s -> 27603.94s]  And he's he's a he's a righteous piece of shit. Like i'll be honest
[27604.82s -> 27607.75s]  He is a righteous piece of shit. That was
[27608.79s -> 27612.86s]  That was just that was rough. That was rough. You guys are righteous piece of shit
[27617.02s -> 27618.92s]  I think
[27618.92s -> 27623.48s]  Uh, I think I gotta just stack vitality at this point. Let's try to get it to 30
[27624.12s -> 27627.77s]  Either that or we put up decks
[27638.22s -> 27639.90s]  Harder than sakiro
[27639.90s -> 27642.47s]  No, it's different
[27642.47s -> 27644.60s]  it's I don't know
[27644.60s -> 27646.60s]  it's definitely very difficult, but
[27647.40s -> 27650.04s]  They give you enough tools to make it so it you'll get it
[27651.34s -> 27652.78s]  in sakiro
[27652.78s -> 27657.34s]  Your only tool was being able to hit l1 at the right time. That was it
[27657.90s -> 27661.86s]  So, all right, you got these like summons. You got these like magical spells. You got a horse, right?
[27661.94s -> 27664.02s]  There's a lot of ways to go about playing
[27664.74s -> 27668.01s]  this game
[27668.01s -> 27671.29s]  Sakiro you had to do one thing and you had to do it. Well, otherwise it was over
[27671.69s -> 27680.26s]  You might kind of be able to get to that staff
[27680.82s -> 27687.90s]  Okay, i'm gonna do
[27687.90s -> 27689.90s]  I'm gonna regret that later, but fucking whatever
[27690.70s -> 27701.05s]  What do I need for some of this stuff?
[27701.05s -> 27703.05s]  That staff is 52
[27703.53s -> 27706.25s]  Which with my equipment on it's 33
[27707.37s -> 27709.37s]  This thing on it's 36
[27710.73s -> 27712.73s]  So I could definitely get there
[27712.97s -> 27718.22s]  Gotta get bigger to 25. Yeah, that's the plan now
[27719.90s -> 27721.90s]  All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow
[27722.14s -> 27724.58s]  It looks like it's stressed out. I'm just tired
[27725.30s -> 27734.17s]  Helm nerfs your strength that your hp and stamp. Yeah, it does
[27734.97s -> 27740.14s]  This is that was that was crazy. That's crazy. I definitely need some protein or something
[27741.38s -> 27743.38s]  I'm currently melting
[27743.46s -> 27746.50s]  I don't understand what's going on with the internet stuff. I think it's a twitch problem
[27746.50s -> 27748.82s]  But if it's not then that's kind of frustrating too
[27751.30s -> 27755.38s]  All right, i'll see you guys tomorrow we'll start at somewhere around four o'clock
[27757.18s -> 27758.70s]  And we'll go from there
[27758.70s -> 27763.22s]  That was elden ring
[27763.22s -> 27770.52s]  Art good night
[27771.00s -> 27774.90s]  Daylighter
[27774.90s -> 27776.66s]  It turned purple
[27776.66s -> 27782.71s]  I did
[27782.71s -> 27784.71s]  Beat the game what no
[27785.03s -> 27786.79s]  Not even close
[27786.79s -> 27788.23s]  i'm probably a thousand
[27788.23s -> 27793.18s]  Years away from beating it
[27793.18s -> 27795.10s]  I couldn't watch any of the stream because i'm playing it myself
[27795.10s -> 27799.02s]  But listening to this just sounded like you were on the water park ride from hell
[27803.75s -> 27810.14s]  That guy was hell
[27810.14s -> 27812.14s]  That was absolute hell
[27815.72s -> 27820.28s]  But he's dead and we can we can keep going
[27820.92s -> 27827.80s]  Yeah, this this is uh, this has been complain andy
[27828.52s -> 27831.02s]  i'm the guy that complains about uh
[27832.15s -> 27835.59s]  The game the whole time he's playing it what i'm known for
[27836.79s -> 27846.22s]  For all the streams and guy you'll see tomorrow. I'm playing andy part six. That's a good title
[27849.88s -> 27853.77s]  Yeah, see you tomorrow at four o'clock. I just love you. Thanks for hanging out
[27853.77s -> 27854.65s]  I know these go late
