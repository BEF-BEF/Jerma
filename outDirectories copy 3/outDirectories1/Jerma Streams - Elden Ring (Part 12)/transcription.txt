[3.58s -> 17.78s]  Hey, what's up? How you doing? You guys tweet? Yeah, I'm tweeting. I gotta make sure people
[17.78s -> 22.47s]  pee. I gotta make sure people know what's going on. My fan's not even on. What the heck did you do
[22.47s -> 34.54s]  to me? You beaten Margit yet? No, and I don't know. Like once enough people come here, we'll talk
[34.54s -> 42.14s]  about it for a minute. This is Elden. This is like my 12th or like 14th. This is like at least number
[42.14s -> 49.80s]  12 Elden rank streams. And sometimes you just kind of have to understand the games like not for you.
[50.76s -> 57.26s]  I mean we're about like 100 hours into the game and I still have not. This is the first boss, right?
[58.49s -> 61.77s]  I just don't get it. I don't understand like the dodging and shit. And I tried to summon, I've
[61.77s -> 65.13s]  summoned like three people to come in but they always like die because I always just kind of
[65.13s -> 70.70s]  watch because I don't really know how to play. I don't know. I'm gonna try it one more time.
[71.67s -> 79.85s]  But I mean there's only so many times. I think I've died 1,600 times to Margit. I mean I feel
[79.85s -> 85.85s]  like that's not that like high. It's like a hard game. Only like 40% of people that
[85.85s -> 91.38s]  downloaded the game even bought that and killed that boss, okay? I've looked at the steam
[91.38s -> 97.78s]  achievement. Like 50% or something have killed Margit. So I mean it's a hard fucking game.
[98.50s -> 102.55s]  You got it this time. I'll try, I'll do it one more time.
[111.86s -> 122.36s]  You know where Newfoundland is? I don't know. I think so. That's a weird question. You're still
[122.36s -> 131.27s]  on the tree sentinel. You know though if you're okay if you are stuck on the tree sentinel for
[131.27s -> 139.45s]  like five days I don't even know if I would be too upset about that. That means you you're going to
[139.45s -> 144.84s]  be able to play Elden Ring for the next like five years of your life. You will get to slowly
[144.84s -> 151.00s]  experience this game for a half a decade. You'll be able to put it down and pick it up at random times
[151.80s -> 164.74s]  until you have children. And I'll be honest this game is so long I feel like if you just put
[164.74s -> 170.18s]  a few hours into this game every like four or five days or something it will take you a year or two
[170.18s -> 184.30s]  to beat this game. So that's that's just extra content you get to have because the game is good
[184.30s -> 192.06s]  as smite. Well I mean hold on I don't want to be I don't want to be like just handing out like
[192.06s -> 195.42s]  game of the decade awards right? We have to be careful because we have one.
[197.74s -> 203.96s]  All right let's go let's fucking go. I just spent the first like five minutes of this stream
[204.60s -> 215.42s]  I think I don't like gaslighting everybody I don't know why. There's no sound? I got it got it. So um
[215.42s -> 222.54s]  I might not be in the same position I was last stream because I was doing uh Polly's been playing
[223.18s -> 228.55s]  and we did co-op stuff. Something I didn't know about Elden Ring I don't I've never done like
[228.55s -> 239.34s]  co-op in any of Souls games. Um we we're getting invaded every one second after I we would summon
[239.34s -> 245.06s]  each other if you're like oh let's go explore like the lands between honey oh that sounds like this
[245.06s -> 259.58s]  person there and then just to kill us what the fuck we did kill a few invasions only happen in
[259.58s -> 271.18s]  co-op oh use a password we did I swear to god we did it was like okay here I am my summoning sign
[271.18s -> 278.38s]  I would like I would just barely phase into the world and they would be within 15 seconds somebody
[278.38s -> 283.80s]  else would be doing the same thing and then it's just like oh fuck here we go and you either get
[283.80s -> 289.56s]  rid of the person or you get embarrassed a password doesn't do anything for invasions don't use one
[289.56s -> 297.75s]  two three four what the fuck one two three four five is a secure password it's sequential it's
[297.75s -> 318.47s]  easy to remember it's very acable one two that's got to be I would feel I don't know I would feel
[318.47s -> 325.62s]  naked if I had a password that was one two three four five somewhere you know what I mean I would
[325.62s -> 334.58s]  feel awful every day every day wouldn't you feel awful I would just be like like especially if it
[334.58s -> 340.58s]  was like oh hey dude I bet you you won't go one week having one two three four five as your bank
[340.58s -> 351.94s]  password every moment of every second of every single day I'd be like looking at my phone like
[351.94s -> 370.71s]  dude nobody got it right nobody got in no fucking way did you play it as a me strong no okay then
[370.71s -> 374.63s]  you have to start okay then you have to start making new passwords because oh somebody just
[374.63s -> 379.11s]  said oh I usually do like a similar password and add numbers at the end so do you just do
[379.11s -> 385.14s]  one two three four five six seven oh no I remember one two three four five but like I got to add
[385.14s -> 391.58s]  something to this one two three four five six seven eight nine I would that would be so confusing
[391.58s -> 397.26s]  because if you do that enough times all of your passwords are a sequence of one through some
[397.26s -> 407.35s]  number and how are you ever supposed to keep track of that it's impossible anyways I played
[407.35s -> 415.03s]  a little co-op with Holly and we got invaded like five times I was like all right that's fun
[415.67s -> 419.27s]  it's cool though we did well it was one part we get to kind of walk around for like 20 minutes
[419.27s -> 426.89s]  was fun but voice is junk and I know that's the way it is but I was doing the giant area
[426.89s -> 432.39s]  there's a few things I can do that are not in the giant area what is it what is it what's
[432.39s -> 441.14s]  her character uh she I believe she's faith dex or faith faith arcane she's doing the dragon stuff
[441.86s -> 447.77s]  which holy shit those spells are fucking ridiculous those spells are insane
[449.26s -> 455.53s]  the big like dragon head that breathes like the dust that stuff whoa now that's cool
[460.12s -> 471.21s]  dragon spells are awesome man but anyways uh I was gonna continue this is where I was going to go
[472.79s -> 479.43s]  I know that I have to get the other half of the medallion I know I know I'll and I can I ask a
[479.43s -> 498.02s]  question thank you um peach teacher can I go to this place right here and not like end the game
[505.91s -> 511.02s]  yes cherubi you won't be locked out okay I got it because this looks like
[511.90s -> 515.34s]  that looks very important whatever that is so that's what we're gonna go we're gonna go to one
[516.47s -> 523.22s]  then we're gonna go to four and then we're gonna go to bar two very excited I feel like we're
[523.22s -> 533.96s]  getting we're gonna get some hopefully get some big deep lore bits it does change things you don't
[533.96s -> 541.29s]  get locked out of the game until the last boss well let's go let's go do it let's go to one
[541.93s -> 548.41s]  a little advice for elderly people you can hit the b or circle button that enables you to
[548.89s -> 555.91s]  run thanks appreciate it that's pretty cool uh that's pretty cool tactic let's go to one
[568.01s -> 573.05s]  yeah I looked at this area it was like these are giants that may have the red bar is your health
[573.69s -> 583.45s]  oh I thought that was my satan meter what's happening what's behind me
[585.22s -> 589.75s]  oh what I hear okay I know I did hear some what the fuck is happening
[591.66s -> 607.56s]  they're fighting the giant oh no do I help them I think you can handle it
[615.74s -> 630.09s]  I'm gonna help them I helped I'm gone oh god damn it all right I didn't that's a church
[630.89s -> 636.38s]  can I I think these might be the hardest enemy in the game what the fuck why do you have the
[636.38s -> 644.28s]  horse why am I off the horse this is the hardest enemy I think this is the toughest enemy in the
[644.28s -> 656.23s]  game I got invaded bloody finger this is what it felt like playing with Holly last night
[656.23s -> 673.06s]  yesterday whatever it was this is what it felt like volcano how about this fucking freezing mist
[673.06s -> 684.98s]  well bro without the r bye oh oh by the way by the way everybody you might have noticed some
[684.98s -> 695.62s]  spells I got some spells I all right shut up and play okay listen I went and got I fixed my spell
[695.62s -> 701.22s]  thing I had a bunch of useless spells I was trying to prepare for the stream I didn't play offline
[701.22s -> 707.77s]  well I didn't play offline I prepared offline these fingernails need to go because they're
[707.77s -> 713.86s]  fucking up I they're bumping into each other there's like a little too long and I might just
[713.86s -> 724.52s]  clip them on stream okay I cleaned up my inventory I didn't play off stream I prepared off stream
[727.30s -> 731.70s]  all right this time I'm not going to be an idiot and go attack the birds that are attacking that
[731.70s -> 753.29s]  giant prepare better I think I did I had 200 souls it doesn't matter okay here we go all right
[753.29s -> 758.33s]  invade me again this time there's not two or three giant birds attacking me they are probably the
[758.33s -> 763.77s]  hardest enemy in the game they're the tankiest they have the most powerful move set they're
[763.77s -> 785.05s]  crazy all right just do it let's go your headphones go to ice mist does this move do anything
[785.85s -> 802.86s]  like I mean I guess I kind of hurt him for a second damn it that fucking hurts
[803.74s -> 810.57s]  all right no I don't care about spells anymore I'm just gonna fight the guy nice dodge I haven't
[810.57s -> 820.09s]  played in a while all right I gotta get back into this I was busy getting invaded all right all right
[820.09s -> 830.81s]  let's go ice this sucks what a fucking shitty move it's coming off yeah I like I turn the
[830.81s -> 836.65s]  air conditioning on a little bit higher in one area of the room that's who cares that doesn't
[836.65s -> 845.16s]  do anything you're playing a bimbo ice mage build I know I'm not this is a bimbo ice build
[855.35s -> 868.60s]  come on guys don't forget to post who just had like a million health it's somebody just took like
[868.60s -> 876.02s]  5 000 damage what was that did you see that okay I'm not fucking around anymore we're gonna
[876.74s -> 938.70s]  this person eat the shit out of them here we go the more I storm god damn it this fucking move
[938.70s -> 944.81s]  oh my god I had him too well I don't why did I start doing swift glint stone it was to make
[944.81s -> 951.90s]  you guys think I was doing more than I needed to do I've asked me I'll be honest I was fighting them
[951.90s -> 959.10s]  perfectly normally and I was winning and then I switched to swift glyphs glint glint stone shard
[959.10s -> 963.58s]  and was like wham wham wham like I was doing a fucking like harry potter fight with this person
[963.58s -> 968.70s]  like don't I don't have to do that I don't have to like make like a scene like a cinematic scene
[968.70s -> 976.65s]  for you like ice stone shard like no fucking kill the guy I don't have to do that for some
[976.65s -> 980.73s]  reason my brain was like yo make it a little cinematic for him no I don't care I'm gonna kill
[980.73s -> 984.97s]  him I'm done with this I'm just gonna I'm going to attack them I don't care about the cinematic
[984.97s -> 991.32s]  experience I don't know why I did swift glint stone shard it was to be cinematic
[1005.11s -> 1014.79s]  use the swift glint stone shard whatever all right when I have I cast a spell besides
[1015.51s -> 1046.42s]  someone wears the ice storm this guy's tough oh get zoned oh somebody get zoned huh
[1047.14s -> 1063.34s]  oh David oh my god I gotta fucking kill this guy before this is my mind I'm I wasn't doing
[1063.34s -> 1067.18s]  that for cinematic purposes I was doing that because I thought it was gonna be able to cheese
[1067.18s -> 1071.72s]  it all right just fight him that was not for cinematic purposes that was for killing purposes
[1072.36s -> 1081.50s]  I gotta like I gotta get back into the game man I haven't played in a while I haven't played
[1084.95s -> 1091.58s]  like four days ago Jerma snoozes on this guy snoozes on him I'm telling you oh all right
[1092.22s -> 1115.11s]  this is a pvp player he played this literally every stream yeah but I haven't played it every
[1115.11s -> 1123.62s]  day well I like I took I kind of look like a Simpsons character shit look at over here as
[1123.62s -> 1161.62s]  I'm looking at myself I look like a Simpsons character why do I look like that I got my own
[1161.62s -> 1178.78s]  fucking move don't I god damn it dude don't fucking do it yeah look I look like a like a Simpsons
[1178.78s -> 1191.64s]  character I don't know why I just kind of do this is about rivers of blood best weapon and then the
[1191.64s -> 1203.35s]  mask that's the best sword in the game oh I mean I could have guessed considering it kills you in
[1203.35s -> 1212.84s]  two hits three hits with that move uh weapon of Okina swordsman from the land of reeds a cursed
[1212.84s -> 1224.71s]  weapon that has failed countless men when Mog really the lord of blood first felt Okina's sword
[1224.71s -> 1230.23s]  and madness upon his flesh he had a proposal to offer Okina the life of a demon his thirst would
[1230.23s -> 1240.25s]  never go unsated that sucks it's a bog type weapon uh I can't really use it because arcane
[1240.81s -> 1260.33s]  let's take a look at it that's that's pretty cool that's a katana all right very cool uh so
[1260.33s -> 1266.01s]  that's a mog like weapon it's fine I like I can't use it I'm sure it's great people said it's what
[1266.01s -> 1273.30s]  you guys saying pvp it's the insane and pvp arcane seems actually really cool I'm seeing a lot of
[1273.30s -> 1281.06s]  arcane weapons that I did not think were going to be in this game I thought arcane was going to be
[1281.06s -> 1285.83s]  one of those stats in from software games that just exists for no reason and like there'll be
[1285.83s -> 1291.66s]  like youtube videos of like I put 100 points in luck and beat the first boss right uh but it's
[1291.66s -> 1304.74s]  not it's actually that's cool okay oh uh where's my baby rattle you need to do the mog dance when
[1304.74s -> 1312.47s]  you fight him I mean well we'll probably think it's we'll probably think it's funny use a different
[1312.47s -> 1319.69s]  weapon use the darkmoon great sword it has cold damage yeah but I I have to respect and I'm not
[1319.69s -> 1327.51s]  respecting until I need to because I like this build I like the baby rattle the mog dance causes
[1327.51s -> 1341.18s]  a stun do I have enough these all right sacred tear do I have any more sacred tears very nice
[1341.18s -> 1347.59s]  very nice very nice I have plus 10 is that it I have a plus 10 flask now is that the maximum
[1347.59s -> 1354.76s]  amount of uh sacred tears in the game did I get there plus 12 is the maximum let's put on our
[1354.76s -> 1367.69s]  little detective shades here take a quick look around and I talk to uh usually you can talk to
[1367.69s -> 1385.42s]  what's her name bring out the frog detective plush oh by the way people people that would give me
[1385.42s -> 1391.61s]  shit people that would give me shit you see what's on the shelf right there you see that I got them
[1392.49s -> 1401.82s]  I told you that I was gonna get them see it's the it's the award yeah because I didn't I forgot them
[1402.38s -> 1422.20s]  you see it right here okay they are hanging out back there one of them is just kind of standing
[1422.20s -> 1434.62s]  on one leg it's broken that's okay by the way what's what's the formula for facecam size
[1434.62s -> 1438.70s]  they have there's definitely like a screen resolution scale for facecam because this is
[1438.70s -> 1448.65s]  too big right and this is way too small what's the goldilocks setting for facecam I think that's
[1448.65s -> 1453.75s]  fine I think that's good you don't want to be too you don't want to be too big because it covers
[1453.75s -> 1456.87s]  too much of the game we don't want to be too small because then you can't see my fucking fog
[1456.87s -> 1473.53s]  reaction right here you think I think right here's fine yeah that's fine about the size
[1473.53s -> 1480.18s]  of a postage stamp that's decent yeah I know I don't it's I don't want to be bigger it's it
[1480.18s -> 1496.18s]  takes up too much space that's all that's there so let's get on the uh horse it's a big head
[1497.14s -> 1501.62s]  all right so I mean it's very obvious at this point I think at least from my brain
[1502.74s -> 1508.42s]  these are gigantic skulls like gigantic way bigger than the giants that are here way bigger
[1508.42s -> 1515.08s]  than any giant we've fought in the game so far so like the fingers are they're their fingers
[1515.08s -> 1522.76s]  right this has to be like giant fingers nobody has hands that big right I think that's my theory
[1522.76s -> 1533.72s]  that there are like ultra omega giants that those are their hands right okay what's that
[1540.17s -> 1563.62s]  check the skull's mouth I'm safe in here all right I'm safe in here actually I can cheese you
[1563.70s -> 1575.91s]  that's what we're gonna do I don't think I've ever killed one of these
[1591.59s -> 1595.27s]  four thousand souls damn did they drop anything wait there's another one oh
[1596.23s -> 1618.38s]  where's the other one I heard it all right well I'm gonna take it what I take what I can get here
[1619.42s -> 1639.75s]  no you didn't get out you're fine falling I just want to go in this thing's mouth stop
[1639.75s -> 1655.64s]  leave me alone actually kind of terrifying so in the mouth okay I'll check it had to be so
[1655.64s -> 1667.13s]  cinematic because there's a legendary in here I would have walked by this ancient dragon smithing
[1667.13s -> 1679.58s]  stone oh that's a that's to get something to max level all right all right well thanks for I would
[1679.58s -> 1690.62s]  have just walked by that I really would have but that's to get a max upgraded weapon which I need
[1690.62s -> 1702.36s]  to make a few decisions here get these fucking birds out of here are the boosters worth it I'm
[1702.36s -> 1706.60s]  stuck getting one star yeah I mean if you're getting if you if you're constantly getting
[1706.60s -> 1711.32s]  one and two stars especially one star and all the if you have enough energy to play another time
[1712.92s -> 1718.28s]  I recommend the hammer because what it can do is it before when you go into the boss door
[1718.28s -> 1722.68s]  you know you have the bar that's at the bottom that's like hammer the glove and like the star
[1723.24s -> 1728.12s]  shards thing the hammer does is you tap it and it just the hammer comes down and when
[1728.12s -> 1734.12s]  go and it takes 40 of the boss's hp off which I think it's like it's a it's a really good
[1734.12s -> 1739.80s]  equalizer it is but they're expensive so don't use too many of them I have like four left I
[1739.80s -> 1755.14s]  bought the pack with like 10 what is this I don't have any boosters left I just buy some more fire
[1755.14s -> 1774.55s]  giant it's huge oh god he's like fucking flattened me um all right date the leg it's gonna be a fight
[1774.55s -> 1790.74s]  about patience shit I just broke his I just broke his leg his femur just came out what the fuck just
[1790.74s -> 1822.50s]  came out of him all right break both his legs the ultimate fat rolling oh shit I saw that in slow
[1822.50s -> 1836.09s]  motion maybe I'll get I'll get off the horse oh that sucks is there another bonfire or do I have
[1836.09s -> 1851.27s]  to run maybe I think I am gonna get off the horse for this now I guys I don't have any more hour
[1851.27s -> 1858.81s]  glasses I use the last one they're like a dollar 99 each I cannot freeze the boss for two minutes
[1860.36s -> 1864.84s]  I cannot I fucking well it's just our time that people love to say that I have not I don't have
[1864.84s -> 1885.35s]  any more is there there's a closer bonfire that's the boss door so oh shit this one right here he's
[1885.35s -> 1892.71s]  trying so hard to make it work I mean it's the title of the stream I need to try at least for a
[1892.71s -> 1909.37s]  few minutes I mean I have a VIP pass you know I will say for every time somebody says they hate
[1909.37s -> 1925.54s]  a joke a few weeks later people beg me to do them how many scenarios of like dude fucking stop
[1925.54s -> 1931.46s]  that that joke that's not funny and then like I read in my chat room oh dude do the lala dog
[1931.46s -> 1938.76s]  oh Aaron when can we get some more Aaron can't wait for a week from now when somebody tells me

[2585.40s -> 2590.12s]  like imagine like a whole like a whole like fucking warcraft party all like targeting
[2590.12s -> 2600.26s]  this like big dragons and it's just like get it out of my fucking head like a 40-man raid I
[2600.26s -> 2604.82s]  like I just think of like a huge dragon flying around it's like it's got like 10 targeting points

[2703.83s -> 2711.13s]  where he was I didn't even know where his fucking arms were dude from software can I have an opinion
[2711.13s -> 2716.25s]  here if you have an enemy that's 400 feet tall can you please give us a fucking power ranger power
[2716.25s -> 2723.83s]  but we could just grow as big as they are like they did that in the power rangers it's just like
[2723.83s -> 2728.15s]  they that was oh he got huge time to get in the mega zord and fucking fight the guy
[2729.03s -> 2742.15s]  this is this is a wash right here there's no way we're fucking three flasks you have to shit

[2753.27s -> 2791.93s]  the way I want to say this again it's cool dude right in the eye get him in the eye this is hitting
[2791.93s -> 2818.47s]  him in the eye not even fucking hitting him get out of the way I'm not even fucking hitting this guy
[2818.47s -> 2844.20s]  get out of the way fuck you what oh my god the fucking range is just like I cannot close enough
[2844.20s -> 2860.33s]  to fucking hit him I gotta use this no no no what do I use against this I can't go that close
[2861.37s -> 2874.63s]  get off your horse this is shit no it's not a shitty weapon oh my god I'm so fucking dumb
[2875.27s -> 2890.65s]  I didn't fucking turn on the starlight dude what am I doing am I fucking dumb
[2897.72s -> 2940.62s]  fuck out of here man like fuck you second phase is easier than the first phase is it
[2941.34s -> 2946.62s]  get off the horse dude when I get off the horse this dickhead jumps backwards and then starts
[2946.62s -> 2965.18s]  throwing shit at me no that's not what I wanted to do well in case I lose my way let's try you

[2989.62s -> 2995.93s]  let's get this time okay because I'm not running out there because when I'm out there he's just
[2995.93s -> 3034.06s]  smoke he's so ready okay here he comes jump he's stupid get him I love that guy
[3035.42s -> 3040.36s]  okay dude this is the worst place to fight this guy it really is this is the stupidest
[3040.36s -> 3060.57s]  idea to fight him over here all right I broke his leg I'm getting back on the horse by the way
[3061.45s -> 3078.86s]  it moved oh my god video games are not fun why would I bring the fire surface to fight the fire
[3078.86s -> 3090.66s]  giant that's probably a bad idea actually kind of awesome though just get free and get up
[3101.26s -> 3124.84s]  hey hey did he fall off where's my circle oh god there's an edge get away from the edge I'll
[3124.84s -> 3139.13s]  fall off that edge get away from that please get away from the edge you you didn't even try to hit
[3139.13s -> 3159.08s]  me no come on the one thing that you shouldn't have fucking done and you did it and this thing's
[3159.08s -> 3202.73s]  gonna explode no I knew that was gonna happen all right keep going I don't need summons or
[3202.73s -> 3207.77s]  anything just go go that second phase is not a big deal he's gonna get in there hit him in the
[3207.77s -> 3223.75s]  eyeball or something I don't know do the wind move the wind can I jump on this and ride up his
[3223.75s -> 3303.46s]  body idiot your hand I don't even fucking know where the guy is man god damn it
[3304.42s -> 3317.98s]  yes I'd like to get on the horse make that toggle in the options farm software for the love of god
[3318.54s -> 3323.18s]  make it a check mark just a check mark in the options like oh do you want to confirm to get
[3323.18s -> 3329.34s]  on the horse no check mark in the options a check box a square that you check no I don't I know
[3329.34s -> 3336.36s]  I don't want to confirm to get on the horse after after it dies it's a check box solves that
[3336.36s -> 3371.34s]  hmm let's go boys all right do not summon them yet now something here we go
[3375.77s -> 3394.26s]  god it's so easy just to fucking have the camera spin around and lose track of the guy
[3395.54s -> 3431.88s]  walking on not walking on it all sucks Jesus man get out what do you fucking happen
[3432.60s -> 3526.87s]  oh damn it watch out for that explosion I don't die who died fuck out don't roll over here
[3527.59s -> 3551.22s]  the hands the edge was right there I had nowhere to go the edge was right I was gonna run that way
[3551.22s -> 3565.83s]  but the edge was right there oh no second I need to have what am I have for gear that fucking
[3565.83s -> 3583.26s]  kills you instantly fuck you what gears not gonna help um off the off the horse in the second phase
[3583.26s -> 3586.70s]  that's probably a good idea but fuck man like sometimes you just get caught like that you just
[3586.70s -> 3594.79s]  can't there's nowhere to go if I had gone forward I would fall off the shit I'm gonna get off the
[3594.79s -> 3602.17s]  horse in the second phase press L1 on the horse it goes I know it goes the other way I've been
[3602.17s -> 3607.61s]  doing that since I started the fucking goddamn video game I jumped over that I did I don't
[3607.61s -> 3640.62s]  understand I jumped over it that works that worked nine out of the last 10 times where is it
[3661.38s -> 3693.29s]  god no the fucking turnaround all right off the horse boys let's go summit get off
[3694.01s -> 3729.06s]  hate them out so they explode come on explode already I don't even the fucking camera is so
[3729.06s -> 3750.70s]  stupid how are you supposed to know where they are what the fuck dude how the fuck are you supposed
[3750.70s -> 3757.27s]  to know where those even go unlocked camera locked camera the guy fucking rolls around and
[3757.27s -> 3766.30s]  then the camera like how am I he's supposed to fucking know just get on the horse to run away
[3767.10s -> 3773.35s]  I feel like this probably if I just sit right under his like groin area that he probably just
[3773.35s -> 3779.48s]  can't do anything don't walk the camera I just don't how are you supposed to even know where
[3779.48s -> 3797.83s]  those fucking explosions happen you're supposed to guess just guess how are you supposed to just
[3797.83s -> 3818.49s]  run away from that or what I'm just gonna stay right in his groin on second base
[3828.17s -> 3829.85s]  such a piece of shit really is
[3842.01s -> 3850.50s]  come on more stamina give me a break damn it the fucking endurance this is why I need like 35
[3850.50s -> 3936.10s]  points in endurance not 10 get out move please no get off the horse god oh he's face explodes or
[3936.10s -> 4069.22s]  something oh my god where's my staff oh I couldn't see
[4081.98s -> 4082.62s]  it's a cliff
[4087.42s -> 4102.52s]  no get away from the fucking cliff dude
[4139.83s -> 4149.08s]  oh that guy sucks that guy sucks that fight sucks that guy sucks I thought I was gonna walk
[4149.08s -> 4159.32s]  right off the cliff oh my god I thought I was walking off the cliff that was happening to me
[4159.32s -> 4162.52s]  in real life by the way that guy was actually hurting me and that was coming after me in real
[4162.52s -> 4173.14s]  life I honest to god thought that I was I was gonna die in real life in a chair like when he
[4173.94s -> 4190.31s]  moved anybody did the elbow drop I was dead 180 000 souls are you shitting me dude you know what I
[4190.31s -> 4198.17s]  think I built up enough frost on him to do that chunk at the end that's what happened I don't
[4198.17s -> 4207.88s]  know if I win that fight without that oh my god that was ridiculous okay that was that was tough
[4209.56s -> 4218.39s]  uh is there a race here probably but really though give me a checkbox to check the fucking
[4218.39s -> 4233.74s]  horse thing I I just it's I will complain about that all day you're gonna bite your control all
[4233.74s -> 4237.90s]  right you know what I haven't been spoiled on anything but I just know that this boss
[4237.90s -> 4243.10s]  had a lot of people have taken like 10 plus hours to beat I'm all looking forward to that one
[4244.54s -> 4252.52s]  I might just turn around and walk the other direction Jesus is there a grace there right
[4252.52s -> 4263.32s]  there I actually bit my controller on that one really fuck I don't know bite my stuff
[4271.54s -> 4285.59s]  every boss from this point on is complete ass oh Jesus that's good to know that's great all
[4285.59s -> 4295.90s]  right dude 20 endurance seriously like that's why I can't do anything I think it just goes into
[4295.90s -> 4313.10s]  health 60 intelligence or get to 50 health I'm going home I feel like health is way more important
[4313.10s -> 4334.17s]  right now although I got a remembrance see the remembrances that was insane you're still doing
[4334.17s -> 4357.78s]  that okay what do you get for this giants red braid strength decks and faith hefty whip woven
[4357.78s -> 4364.23s]  from the flame red hair of a fire giant every giant is red of hair and radigan was said to have
[4364.23s -> 4374.97s]  despised his own red locks perhaps that was a curse of their kind flame dance or burn oh
[4374.97s -> 4382.38s]  flame 27 faith raises a series of flame pillars around caster can't really use either one of
[4382.38s -> 4389.91s]  these can i there's flame pillars charging yeah yeah yeah the fire giants borrowed from the power
[4389.91s -> 4396.31s]  of a fell god and still they were defeated yet their failure released them from their solitary
[4396.31s -> 4406.01s]  curse to serve as keepers of the flame for eternity I'll just break it look at how red
[4406.01s -> 4417.08s]  and sweaty I got in the last 40 minutes of that boss I go to shit so quickly something I've
[4417.08s -> 4424.76s]  noticed about myself I like I'll look good I look like great and then like after it after like 30
[4424.76s -> 4429.16s]  minutes or an hour I kind of just like it's almost like somebody's like crafted me out of clay or
[4429.16s -> 4434.36s]  something and then like I'm just gonna go to shit in an hour I can only show up to a function for
[4434.36s -> 4442.68s]  like two to three hours before like I go to shit and I start to like melt nice dad chapstick I've
[4445.58s -> 4449.26s]  because I want to like moisturize my lips because they're dry because I'm
[4449.26s -> 4461.80s]  fucking older and I get dry lips I get dry hold on how much is gonna get not that much
[4461.80s -> 4469.14s]  no that's not that much considering where I am in the game all right I need 87,000 souls but not

[4795.94s -> 4800.26s]  like is it simple is it gonna cause a bunch of problems it's gonna take like two hours
[4800.82s -> 4821.66s]  how hard is it to get to mug it's simple yep okay tell me how simple it is to get the medallion
[4822.06s -> 4833.26s]  okay all right all right all right
[4852.17s -> 4866.74s]  is the cocoa puffs bird still like crazy or did they is that still a thing they killed them off

[4915.51s -> 4926.92s]  oh not as tough not as tough as your big brother are you okay so where where is it from here it's
[4926.92s -> 4933.30s]  like down I didn't even do this urn tree did I even do this I've been here before

[5054.23s -> 5057.35s]  yeah I mean this is gonna be easy say that now but it is
[5058.79s -> 5067.66s]  it's probably would have been really tricky uh like eight streams ago
[5069.18s -> 5076.74s]  okay if I lose to this guy at level like 110

[5291.03s -> 5295.03s]  their homes most of these knights were sent to the fringes where they were forced to start anew
[5295.03s -> 5309.29s]  with only to spare for company and a lot of raw meat dumplings you can sort by new really good
[5309.29s -> 5321.50s]  tonight let's go do this uh urn tree thing okay the other half of the medallion where was that

[5377.32s -> 5386.38s]  mission here are you sure was it verified because there's a lot of mog uh imposters that think um
[5386.38s -> 5391.02s]  they like pretend to be mog and stuff I don't think I don't think the real mog even has twitter
[5391.74s -> 5399.30s]  I mean I have I got a phone number so we text and shit I don't think I remember him talking
[5399.30s -> 5414.49s]  about twitter there we go I'm gonna kill this pretty yeah how did I not come over here and do

[5515.61s -> 5521.48s]  this just gives me half of my fp it does a huge amount of a way use explode with no soul loss for
[5521.48s -> 5536.30s]  homeward bone really does that actually work or are you just making that up that is actually

[6073.80s -> 6080.68s]  here witnessed a sight much the same in my infancy the oppression of the weak murder and pillage
[6080.68s -> 6090.89s]  unchecked a waking nightmare made by men but this time I'm a woman grown and though the
[6090.89s -> 6098.50s]  suffering cannot be undone I can still meet out justice justice to the oppressors let the scars
[6098.50s -> 6109.88s]  I carve remind them I am the felly Lou warrior oh right okay um but this time I'm a woman grown
[6109.96s -> 6117.34s]  and though the suffering cannot be undone I can push in class justice justice to the oppressors
[6117.34s -> 6133.30s]  I'm like 16 days ago I don't think I need to open those notes anymore this time though the suffer
[6133.30s -> 6145.24s]  well cool so this is dead the guy fucking died I can't even that's so funny didn't even get a
[6145.24s -> 6157.27s]  chance yeah syllabus had an entire other character arc it's like in episode two in the in the anime
[6157.27s -> 6162.31s]  of Elden Ring he gave the task to the character excuse me somebody just throw a fucking board at
[6162.31s -> 6172.50s]  me and then like 12 episodes later he's just dead and you what you realize is they there was
[6172.50s -> 6178.42s]  like a the director of the show just cut out the whole fucking part of like episode nine that was
[6178.42s -> 6184.58s]  like 14 minutes of content and she's like why did they do that it's just like well I wanted to
[6184.58s -> 6188.26s]  kind of see what happened why did they do that why why would they cut the entire half of that
[6188.26s -> 6195.45s]  episode's arc out it's like oh we weren't sure that people were going to enjoy that that part
[6195.45s -> 6201.93s]  of the anime so we just got rid of it right away this village is done for even if it's just you
[6202.01s -> 6226.44s]  old albus hide well and still your breath albus oh albus's shack they all they all kind of live

[6277.77s -> 6286.12s]  in an american bathroom some of them are literally this wide so when you sit there
[6286.92s -> 6292.04s]  and you realize that like like you don't have any fucking privacy i don't know why it can't
[6292.04s -> 6297.94s]  just be walled why can't it just be walled why people not know what i'm talking about here
[6301.77s -> 6313.29s]  it's like these little slivers of area that nobody knows what i'm talking about it's because there
[6313.29s -> 6323.80s]  is this is i think this is solely an american problem from what i've heard but anyways yeah

[6334.76s -> 6340.38s]  shitting in a public bathroom because i hate that like you just open on all sides
[6345.24s -> 6359.94s]  it's the wrong way i was everyone avoids that but i i truly avoid it i actually don't do it

[6561.32s -> 6569.29s]  i feel like is it to have the pieces of like steel or aluminum whatever the fuck they are

[8129.58s -> 8141.59s]  and i pick out one sir no honest to god like something that you don't realize you're gonna
[8141.59s -> 8152.71s]  do when you start streaming is be able to just like that one it's weird it's uh it's actually
[8152.71s -> 8166.34s]  taking a long time to do that like actually read it all right almost there one more little

[8309.70s -> 8322.38s]  probably could i could probably do it pretty well if i really tried that's such an old craft that
[8322.38s -> 8331.32s]  doesn't really exist anymore doesn't it right that's a very old crap it's not very many mimes
[8331.80s -> 8350.26s]  huh what about a puppeteer yeah those that too all right what do i need eighty eight seven

[8449.16s -> 8455.40s]  i am on my way to the boss and i'm gonna just run and jump down there this run really sucks
[8456.20s -> 8460.46s]  i wish there was a faster way to get here so i need to kill this boss first try
[8461.82s -> 8483.43s]  where's the wait wait a minute and then this way you gotta run where's the statue go

[8526.97s -> 8535.56s]  to why is there a statue here if there's a fucking grace right there i said i can't commit this to
[8535.56s -> 8540.28s]  memory because there's no fucking i can't commit an invisible bridge to memory okay it doesn't
[8540.28s -> 8545.64s]  exist i can't commit it to memory it's shit don't exist how am i supposed to commit it
[8545.64s -> 8560.26s]  it's down here so it's over there all right okay so but can i just go from here
[8562.94s -> 8568.90s]  and i just like okay can i just run forward can i just run forward i have to actually run all the
[8568.90s -> 8587.13s]  way around that's such a pain in the ass i don't want to do this every fucking time and then it's
[8587.13s -> 8599.32s]  down there oh my god this is such a horrible i gotta kill this guy first try statue oh thank you
[8599.32s -> 8633.94s]  my god thank god okay stray mimicked here oh my god serpent get him he's using freezing mist he's
[8633.94s -> 8651.51s]  a moron all right 1v1 nice come on get him that using that move is cheating you can't use that
[8651.51s -> 8667.18s]  move i don't even have an equip cheater you get fucking 20% health gain oh that's so dumb
[8668.14s -> 8700.78s]  oh this is so unfair that's these member fights are so funny thankfully it's not a hard fight
[8701.58s -> 8725.78s]  black flame monk amon and some death root very cool all right oh yeah um where the hell am i where
[8725.78s -> 8741.48s]  am i where's that going i was going to like the halig tree and i ended up down there that's a
[8741.48s -> 8768.52s]  cratered snowfield okay so this is interesting show me the path oh gentle lights promise path
[8768.52s -> 8794.23s]  path to the halig tree all right so i gotta follow these what is the halig tree i guess
[8794.23s -> 8806.86s]  why ask that question when we're gonna find out probably in like two minutes it's like watching
[8806.86s -> 8815.66s]  a marvel movie it's like watching infinity war and just not seeing it for the first time you sit
[8815.66s -> 8822.34s]  with like a room of people like Thanos is going like this you lean over going hey dude is he gonna
[8822.34s -> 8829.29s]  snap his fingers no is he does he just tell me dude it's about to happen in one fucking second
[8829.29s -> 8852.94s]  just watch i just need to know all right let's keep going what are you guys doing out here
[8855.18s -> 8866.36s]  they're looking at something i had something in the mist that's so fucking rude i just swung back
[8866.36s -> 8900.23s]  he got that right in his face stray boys i know that was i'm sorry ah holy shit stop that's not
[8900.23s -> 8932.82s]  fair you want to play that game we can play that fucking game fine we'll play that game all right
[8932.82s -> 8943.51s]  these enemies suck uh they have a lot of health um i'm not following the lights anymore which is
[8943.51s -> 8951.30s]  probably bad i guess i maybe i should until i find a map fragment which i'm sure there is one
[8952.02s -> 8992.38s]  am i hitting something else oh okay go up here this is it no that's a fucking rock
[8999.72s -> 9008.02s]  somber spitting stone eight very useful i do need the other one though is this it why is it all
[9008.02s -> 9044.65s]  surrounding here now oh shit saint trina's torch what is that oh shit i lost the lights where are
[9044.65s -> 9060.34s]  they got a light i need a light saint trina's torch how's his sleep build up decks and faith
[9060.98s -> 9067.67s]  handles stand towards the burns with a light purple flame carvings depict saint trina but in
[9067.67s -> 9080.73s]  adult form somewhat unnervingly the light purple flame induces sleep okay i can't use it oh nice
[9081.53s -> 9099.24s]  i really need that considering how horrible it is to see here well that was i'm gonna help you guys
[9099.24s -> 9104.71s]  because like that was seriously pathetic how did you even get here dude you're so level one
[9105.35s -> 9113.72s]  how did you get here this was a lost player he doesn't he doesn't know where he's supposed to be
[9114.94s -> 9122.52s]  dude can i suggest east limb grave you're not you're way too low to be here i know you're gonna get
[9122.52s -> 9126.76s]  really mad because you're gonna get killed in one hit this is to teach you that you need to your
[9126.76s -> 9145.43s]  like you go go back to like the limb grave he warped to the end game zone and then he returned
[9145.43s -> 9167.18s]  the game to fucking target this game sucks i don't get it it's funny because i i have that
[9167.18s -> 9172.06s]  perspective of not understanding how these games are supposed to be played and not just not getting
[9172.06s -> 9178.38s]  it and being and just being like i don't get it like why are these fun what's the point if you go
[9178.38s -> 9185.06s]  to my if you go watch my dark souls prepare to die it was like 2012 i didn't get it i didn't
[9185.06s -> 9190.10s]  understand the game that was not me playing with any experience at all with any of these games it
[9190.10s -> 9195.46s]  was it was just kind of like oh this i know this released and i know it's like a hard game that's
[9195.46s -> 9201.30s]  it i didn't get it um it's actually kind of a stupid video to watch i don't even know why
[9201.30s -> 9207.58s]  i don't have it deleted like it's so bad i just walk around with a shield and talk about how little
[9207.58s -> 9212.54s]  the shield is like oh look at my baby shield and i was trying to block with the parry buckler
[9214.25s -> 9218.01s]  i fell off the clip a few times and then i didn't i don't think i even got out of the tutorial zone
[9218.49s -> 9223.53s]  like i don't think i even i think i beat the asylum demon and that was it i was like oh i
[9223.53s -> 9229.43s]  did it okay i played enough to make a video it's like dude that's like the first five minutes of
[9229.43s -> 9239.00s]  the game all right i'm kind of lost we yeah we we did rewatch this recently like a year or two ago
[9239.72s -> 9251.53s]  shit all right i gotta go back and look for those things there's a road here
[9254.79s -> 9265.27s]  how bad is the bit rate on the stream right now i'm curious actually good no way really
[9265.83s -> 9286.41s]  i feel like it'd be terrible oh grace you can actually see that's a good thing
[9291.82s -> 9299.29s]  that's it is that the same one that i got already i think it is you're so close
[9299.29s -> 9307.77s]  to mog i'm sure i am i gotta be careful because i almost have enough souls to level up again which
[9307.77s -> 9322.09s]  is crazy i've already gotten to 80 000 souls almost can i just spend them all right well
[9322.09s -> 9340.07s]  finally get the map is this the halic tree consecrated snow field this is probably right
[9340.07s -> 9361.98s]  here i think it's that i think i think it's that i gotta pee you're back pee time first pee of the
[9361.98s -> 9869.08s]  night i'm gonna get a refill right back okay i am back how do i how do i not startle you guys when
[9869.08s -> 9877.72s]  i come back i just realized this i you it's just hi what should i say what should i do should i
[9877.72s -> 9885.00s]  like tap or something because i have a little bit of compression on my microphone so it makes my
[9885.00s -> 9897.05s]  lows higher in my highs lower whatever right just whisper good all right so that took a little bit
[9897.05s -> 9907.11s]  longer i wanted to get a i wanted to get another uh drink i made another green tea drink but this
[9907.11s -> 9916.01s]  is very interesting because we just got pretty major reveal at this point in the game there is
[9916.01s -> 9927.11s]  another tree is this tree apparently this this is looks pretty big that's this looks that looks
[9927.11s -> 9934.25s]  kind of this looks like this looks big so there's the urd tree and then there's this other tree
[9934.89s -> 9963.96s]  i have officially revealed the entire elden ring map it's official look at that that's cool all
[9963.96s -> 9974.14s]  right so where are we going where's san andres we're going to this place here we're going to
[9974.14s -> 9979.90s]  this place we're going to this place and we're going to go to this place and there's also a
[9979.90s -> 9987.45s]  dungeon here a lot to look at we're going to start at number three at the little minor tree here
[9988.33s -> 10012.79s]  check your key items i don't have this room alice key sewer key fingerprint grape
[10013.43s -> 10036.55s]  onica forgetfulness uh what am i looking for you're looking for the fingerprint grape eyeball of
[10036.55s -> 10042.63s]  the night bike inflamed yellow seared with repulsive fingerprint burn akin to those that marred his
[10042.63s -> 10048.71s]  entire body if offered to the blind maiden it will lead her to the source of the distant light
[10048.71s -> 10058.20s]  allowing her to become a finger maiden eat this didn't i get i swear to god why were we talking
[10058.20s -> 10067.35s]  about mogg check my why is there like a key why are people telling me mogg is on the far left
[10067.99s -> 10082.90s]  it's mogg's shackle you got a reusable item oh it's not a key item okay find the accursed
[10082.90s -> 10088.34s]  people called the omen and these ones were made to keep a particular omen under strict confinement
[10089.34s -> 10094.30s]  though faint the shackle still retain vestiges of power and have to trap the once-bound mogg on
[10094.30s -> 10102.58s]  earth can't use it only for a short time all right well whatever i let's just let's start
[10102.58s -> 10109.93s]  over here let them ride just that minor tree here let's see what we got we gotta be careful
[10109.93s -> 10119.58s]  because i don't want to lose all these souls but you know whatever let's begin our exploration
[10130.78s -> 10141.78s]  god i'm treating these guys like a joke and i really shouldn't be what the fuck is throwing
[10141.78s -> 10159.21s]  at me why the guys do why they do it like look at me oh there's a rise up there
[10170.60s -> 10178.47s]  damn it all right i'm gonna stay the course here staying the course
[10187.05s -> 10208.70s]  jesus all right oh what a great fucking spell can i just be honest with you
[10212.87s -> 10219.19s]  what an amazing spell i'm ignoring my friends at my birthday party please say something funny go
[10219.19s -> 10225.27s]  hang out with your friends at your birthday party what are you doing go enjoy enjoy an experience
[10225.27s -> 10250.62s]  all right i have enough to level up but i think i can get up there without too much of a problem
[10253.59s -> 10264.58s]  1200 damage you get that hit that's so good what do you got up there it's mogg's birthday
[10265.78s -> 10291.72s]  what is happening hello i this is a prank oh okay it's up there strong blast the horse died
[10291.72s -> 10324.84s]  when all right that's this is weird is that a oh this is national war isn't it oh if you not hit
[10324.84s -> 10340.01s]  it somersmithing stone seven oh all right what's that that's kind of cool
[10340.89s -> 10350.26s]  do i eat oreos um yeah or is good i don't need too many of them though never a good thing to eat
[10350.26s -> 10360.78s]  too many all right wait no that's okay i don't want to go there yet focus on the urn tree or
[10360.78s -> 10370.49s]  whatever is actually up here yeah okay it is an urn tree well it could just be it is a tree like
[10370.49s -> 10375.37s]  what makes an urn tree an urn tree right like if there's a there's a halic tree up there
[10376.01s -> 10380.89s]  is a halic tree an urn tree or they just start as just a tree and they turn into one of these
[10380.89s -> 10391.80s]  things i don't everybody always talks about like baddie right like oh man sorry i'll just watch
[10391.80s -> 10398.06s]  the baddie video and i'll figure it all out and like can we like give baddie some credit here
[10398.06s -> 10405.30s]  a lot of it he has the monumental task of having to sort all this shit out for everybody
[10406.02s -> 10417.96s]  that seems like impossible i don't even like where do you even start like this is the world
[10417.96s -> 10422.68s]  is so huge and there's so much to think about there's so much to do so many pieces of individual
[10422.68s -> 10434.31s]  lore i forgot like half of it already yeah the amount of people that have to come together to
[10434.31s -> 10443.75s]  give knowledge to kind of figure out what the hell even just happened in the game there are
[10443.75s -> 10449.77s]  people still figuring shit out probably but when i used to do like youtube videos like all right so
[10449.77s -> 10457.18s]  the spy came out with a new knife that's i it does 10 more damage and um it has
[10458.70s -> 10464.06s]  it freezes people when you kill them wow that took a long time to figure that out
[10464.86s -> 10469.16s]  if i was if i was making elden ring lore videos oh my god i'd have like a spreadsheet that was
[10469.16s -> 10485.21s]  like 5000 pages high that'd be a lot harder you really should do the sewer boss i don't
[10485.29s -> 10505.94s]  i don't know what that means i'm closer me strong will take care of it this this is
[10505.94s -> 10527.88s]  for whatever it is i don't know i just lightning enhancements probably definitely going down there
[10527.88s -> 10530.92s]  without a doubt that's a cool it looks like the haunted mansion of disneyland
[10533.88s -> 10545.26s]  all right but am i going to get my ass kicked by this thing i'm afraid of this
[10546.98s -> 10563.08s]  it might be an avatar here i don't see a statue so i must i don't know is there a boss
[10563.72s -> 10598.73s]  maybe not like it would have spawned already something back there kind of what i gotta get
[10598.73s -> 10615.56s]  them oh no i don't just do this let's move the game even i offer a warp point here
[10618.49s -> 10622.25s]  i will absolutely keep so what's wrong with why is there nothing uh at this surgery
[10623.05s -> 10642.15s]  holding sunflower nothing over here or something behind it it's empty so um
[10643.03s -> 10661.30s]  what's behind it and what's with the tree these the phantom tree right it's weird like what's
[10661.30s -> 10685.46s]  with that they look cool you have to have a significance is what they do right what's over
[10685.46s -> 10702.28s]  here i don't really that's it i feel like i'm missing something i feel like it's not this this
[10702.28s -> 10750.82s]  simple oh what why are you abandoning your post we need to get out of this this is a weird place
[10750.82s -> 10812.50s]  to fight you oh that hurt oh frost really is really bad on these guys what are you standing
[10812.50s -> 10874.54s]  behind fuck off thank god jeremy don't do that one more that move is so fucking good 160 000 souls
[10874.54s -> 10886.14s]  thorny cracked here and ruptured crystal tier 160 000 they are really piling on the souls at
[10886.14s -> 10891.98s]  this point i'm just you know what i'm taking this right now i don't even care i'm taking one i have
[10891.98s -> 10906.34s]  30 i have 30 fucking just take it just take one i'm never gonna use it ever so what was that i'm
[10906.34s -> 10911.69s]  honest to god i just looked at that and got angry i have 30 of these i could use one of these every
[10911.69s -> 10916.39s]  10 minutes and it'll last me the rest of the goddamn game i have 75 and i don't use them
[10916.39s -> 10927.72s]  you just start using them what's the point it's plus five to every step oh it was here thorny
[10928.36s -> 10941.03s]  consecutive attacks go stronger in mixed physique i gotta rupture two of these but if i do both of
[10941.03s -> 10953.34s]  these is just do a double explosion what's the difference you just do an omega explosion i feel
[10953.34s -> 10959.34s]  like that do people all right do people just drink that in pvp and just like fucking run up and blow
[10959.34s -> 10968.47s]  up next to somebody i would assume it's probably yes so that's why they made that that's the only
[10968.55s -> 10978.62s]  reason all right cool i need to set out a bonfire so let's hope that there's one i'm gonna assume
[10978.62s -> 10985.48s]  that all right let's clear that so that's cool i am gonna check back here at three what's back here
[10986.04s -> 11007.93s]  i gotta go down i'm looking for a another bonfire going to that green uh spooky manner
[11009.05s -> 11013.59s]  all right this is where they this is where the lightning is we're gonna do this
[11014.31s -> 11021.88s]  like that all right i'm gonna assume i'm gonna go to one first because there might be a bonfire
[11021.88s -> 11043.06s]  here i don't see one here although there probably is one in there at least it kind of hurts my head
[11044.18s -> 11056.46s]  we should play fortnight now they took building out i'm not into it oh come on i thought that
[11056.46s -> 11070.71s]  was a bonfire that guy has a bone arrow i didn't want to hit that person oh my god i'm gonna die
[11071.35s -> 11087.64s]  these guys are fucking rough okay just you're just in the fucking way i'm trying to run forward and
[11087.64s -> 11096.06s]  i'm just like there is a thing of dog just in the way why does every single thing that has
[11096.06s -> 11098.94s]  collision in this game have like an extra five inches around it of collision
[11101.85s -> 11132.14s]  fucking goddamn rune ark is gone too take another one it's just like it's like the huntsman sniper
[11132.14s -> 11147.51s]  hitboxes everybody is like a gigantic cube that bumps into each other okay just go sit at the
[11147.51s -> 11167.90s]  bottom i don't want to lose these who is who dude let's go to tf2 to tf2 i look kind of do i look
[11167.90s -> 11183.58s]  like a little dark i look like i'm kind of like i think it turns up at this point i don't know
[11184.54s -> 11191.08s]  intelligence is cool but is it gonna get out of reach where i can't get to like 50 health
[11191.08s -> 11205.70s]  eventually here in a minute how much um i need 68 or 70 all right i can put the moon spell on
[11206.26s -> 11224.28s]  let's try it i'm gonna get rid of freezing mist because i don't think it's really worth it but
[11224.28s -> 11233.42s]  here is ranny's dark moon use the caster as a vessel to incarnate a cold dark moon and sends
[11233.42s -> 11239.18s]  it floating towards foes the dark moon dispels all sorcery that it touches temporarily reduces
[11239.18s -> 11247.85s]  magic damage negation for those it strikes okay i can now officially use this move let's see what
[11247.85s -> 11275.58s]  it does am i my moon in here does no damage it's pretty strong direct kind of contradiction
[11275.58s -> 11281.26s]  can't like if i go in there can they hit me you can still get hit you're immune from magic but
[11281.26s -> 11293.02s]  not physical hits okay oh yeah i'll try it i do want to level up one more time because
[11293.02s -> 11302.14s]  there's way too many souls yeah let's kill a few things it also reduces magic resistance of
[11302.14s -> 11331.03s]  enemies hit let's go test it on this group over here hi and that's like 1600 damage i can hit
[11331.03s -> 11355.98s]  more than one person right how far does it go damn okay that's actually pretty good all right i you're
[11355.98s -> 11374.54s]  very vulnerable in there though i wonder if there's any good use for that like a boss fight
[11375.26s -> 11395.21s]  shit these guys hurt a lot that's a lot of damage it really does a lot old sorcery is pretty fun
[11396.49s -> 11403.90s]  it should be enough to level up you use it once and then their magic defense is low and you can
[11403.90s -> 11426.63s]  spam the blade how long does it last about a minute oh so question for those of you that are
[11426.63s -> 11435.50s]  lore masters here is it worth me getting to 70 intelligence to go get the full moon
[11436.38s -> 11452.70s]  from ranala's resemblance is it worth doing that the dark moon is actually better so i'm
[11452.70s -> 11457.43s]  going to work on this now i'm going to get this to 50 and then we're going to do we're going to
[11457.43s -> 11467.54s]  split once i get to 50 vigor we're going to go mind and endurance 50 50 dark was actually better
[11467.54s -> 11490.17s]  okay let's keep going so the plan was to go up here you don't need 50 endurance no i was thinking
[11490.17s -> 11498.50s]  again it's like 25 it has not been a problem until the last hour so i'm imagining it's because of
[11500.07s -> 11505.11s]  uh it's kind of later in the game there's a lot more stuff you have to do a lot of more dodging
[11505.11s -> 11511.19s]  and moving around sprinting and jumping and there anything here this is like nothing okay
[11515.19s -> 11526.52s]  get it get it what are you doing pick it up what the fuck this game makes me so mad
[11527.16s -> 11537.75s]  yeah i just mean for the next five to ten levels not permanently all right let's do it let's do
[11537.75s -> 11559.62s]  the uh spooky green manner we're going double headphones by the way just a bomb or dina
[11560.42s -> 11598.78s]  liturgical town just a boss door okay um hello can't go in there over here maybe a lot of sealed
[11598.78s -> 11616.04s]  doors black knife hood armor gauntlets greaves hold on a sec where is that scale armor used
[11616.04s -> 11628.44s]  by the black knife assassins forge to make no sound muffles the sound of footsteps interesting
[11629.16s -> 11633.24s]  the assassins that carried out the deeds of the night of the black knives were all women
[11633.24s -> 11646.17s]  and rumored to be newman who had close ties with america herself really i'm not doing anything
[11646.17s -> 11670.26s]  like my hood what about this thing raises dexterity as it lowers focus well it's a good
[11670.26s -> 11691.64s]  deck summon uh i don't think i can get up all right i gotta keep going around another one of
[11691.64s -> 11698.84s]  those bell demons and one of these guys is here weird okay well let's go
[11702.23s -> 11713.02s]  hard to tell how much damage is doing but i feel like it's a lot
[11728.26s -> 11737.21s]  damn rotten doulas greaves and rotten great axe they're throwing so much equipment at you
[11741.77s -> 11746.25s]  bronze snakes eaten through by scarlet rot formed by gladiators who were driven from the coliseum
[11747.05s -> 11761.10s]  where it becomes slightly easier to target and where is it rotten axe x it's in scarlet scarlet
[11761.10s -> 11772.38s]  rot one of the few items in the game that has scarlet rot build up on the weapon that's actually
[11772.38s -> 11792.62s]  seems pretty good moon did 2000 damage to that guy yeah oh no i don't want to do that all right
[11792.62s -> 11799.90s]  well there's a bell demon um that looks like a america church so i know i'm gonna do that but
[11800.94s -> 11803.82s]  there might be a sacred tier over there so i'm just gonna go get it i'm dead
[11808.20s -> 11820.60s]  i didn't think it went down that far i thought that was maybe five feet below where i was
[11825.05s -> 11841.51s]  all right whatever it goes did you look go open up any of the red dead redemption two
[11842.74s -> 11849.66s]  streams all you need to do is open them up for five seconds if within within 10 minutes if i
[11849.66s -> 11861.27s]  don't crash the horse into a rock i i would okay no why am i getting off the horse why can't i
[11861.83s -> 11870.12s]  what's happening why can't i use my thing i can't use my spell why why can't i use it why is this
[11870.12s -> 11886.68s]  banned this is a banned move oh because my great room fuck i didn't know i had to use one of those
[11888.82s -> 11924.47s]  oh that's really bad no yeah all right will this person leave me alone
[11959.56s -> 11967.46s]  okay it's time it's time to make the ultimate decision do i get a plus 10 bastard stars
[11976.33s -> 11988.82s]  or do i wait to get a plus 10 regal scepter i have i'm i don't know because the issue that i have
[11988.82s -> 11995.78s]  with this i feel like in this late game here i've been doing way more sorceries than i were before
[11999.69s -> 12018.98s]  like two to three hundred percent more because i don't know you'll get more what do you think
[12024.39s -> 12031.56s]  there are a lot of plus 10 stones you're good how accurate is that though like am i going to run
[12031.56s -> 12044.04s]  into them soon i could do both okay there's a lot i got i have at least three all right very soon
[12044.04s -> 12057.99s]  okay all right well then i might as but i might as well make this as best as it can be there's
[12057.99s -> 12064.39s]  definitely no reason not to because this is a look at the 179 one that's so much more damage
[12064.39s -> 12069.98s]  i'm going for it but let's see what the pole says but i've made my decision what does pole say let
[12069.98s -> 12083.46s]  me like this webcam needs to brighten up a little bit i don't know why it's so low that's way too
[12083.46s -> 12104.12s]  much that's better there um yeah i'm gonna do it uh it's worth it it's worth it i need it
[12104.12s -> 12120.65s]  i'm definitely gonna need it done plus 10 baby rattle it's been done i want to upgrade this
[12120.65s -> 12126.97s]  serpent my snake friend so bad to plus like nine or plus 10 where can i get a glove warp five
[12127.93s -> 12134.86s]  i want to go do that right now i want that i want that plus nine plus 10 where can i get a somber
[12134.86s -> 12141.67s]  um not a somber ghost grave glove warp five i don't think they're in the store i'll check
[12141.67s -> 12155.00s]  though i have them i have all of them except for five i have a lot of all of them except for five
[12159.78s -> 12172.49s]  right this is ghost glove wart this is not the right one ghost glove wart do i have any bells
[12173.45s -> 12184.86s]  you need to get a grave picker's bell bearing let's get the bell clear the catacombs by the

[14493.62s -> 14501.29s]  guys have those where you were yeah yep they were these little boxes that you'd go over and they'd
[14501.29s -> 14506.84s]  be a demonstration where you'd press the button it would seriously be like this be like check out
[14506.84s -> 14511.88s]  the the real raw power of the sound i'm gonna mourn you i'm actually gonna do some sound here
[14511.88s -> 14517.29s]  so watch your headphones you'd go like this you'd hold the button so here's my finger be pressing
[14517.29s -> 14528.52s]  the button and be like this and it's just like oh my god it's getting way too fucking loud

[14546.26s -> 14556.82s]  showed you the volume indicator it was just like it just got louder here we go it was the worst
[14556.82s -> 14569.13s]  day it was pretty it was pretty bad plus six plus seven plus eight plus nine snake friend is now a
[14569.13s -> 14584.38s]  plus nine unbeatable unstoppable spirit summon i still can't wait did i get i think i can do the
[14584.38s -> 14595.38s]  staff i need a nine i have an eight okay i love these things though i think they've been great
[14595.38s -> 14605.06s]  i've been using these headphones for a very long time at least like five years at least this myth
[14605.06s -> 14611.62s]  has dialogue so that was cool i did that now let's go and continue back already here i was
[14611.62s -> 14621.94s]  gone the girl has come along as ever time and technique have made her stronger it is good to
[14621.94s -> 14632.57s]  see an imprisoned monster does not deserve an apprentice the time nicely what she feels like
[14632.57s -> 14638.06s]  to me i've gone soft and it isn't easy
[14657.30s -> 14663.54s]  greeting uh i am not because we got the boys and we got the man serpent so i'm good thank you
[14663.54s -> 14670.92s]  though appreciate that was really good work you did all right it's time to go back to what we
[14670.92s -> 14684.41s]  were doing which was up here i have a few things marked the idea was to this is odina i'm gonna go
[14684.41s -> 14693.83s]  to this church first because yeah let's go to the church first because the church definitely has
[14694.79s -> 14697.75s]  a uh tier in it so might as well get it
[14704.38s -> 14711.75s]  it better summons what are you saying oh left side i'm gonna go over here
[14712.31s -> 14729.91s]  i will i'll do this whole area i'll do this i'll do that it's only like 8 30 so i think
[14729.91s -> 14737.46s]  this one's fine boys have helped us more times than i can count and the serpent does a funny
[14737.46s -> 14743.06s]  fire dance thing and it makes us laugh every time and remember sometimes that's all i'm looking for
[14743.86s -> 14748.47s]  when i get really mad at a boss and i'm like really not having a good time
[14749.35s -> 14753.74s]  and i just summon the funny serpent friend that comes out and is like doing this thing
[14754.62s -> 14761.66s]  it makes me not mad anymore and it's like this is as fun like that i think that makes me happy
[14761.66s -> 14778.70s]  again so like i i haven't been a good time again that alive you want one of the broken summons i
[14778.70s -> 14783.80s]  don't i kind of don't want one of the broken summons it's i mean it's cool but these things
[14783.80s -> 14802.73s]  attack i guess let's let's just start looking around are there enemies here i do have to watch
[14802.73s -> 14843.78s]  it i don't want to die with this many runes everybody have any dialogue no just looking
[14843.78s -> 14879.32s]  around just making sure i don't miss anything uh um that's sealed it's a puzzle what do you want
[14880.20s -> 14889.62s]  like the four figures in the ever jail any five
[14889.62s -> 14917.62s]  i'm gonna level up first i feel like this is gonna be annoying i was gonna kill like one thing
[14918.34s -> 14943.13s]  why do you guys have so much fucking health and armor almost like this is the last
[14943.13s -> 14963.34s]  was sewn in the game it's more efficient all right give me i'm gone gone gone gone gone gone
[14963.34s -> 14978.33s]  gone gone gone i'm sitting at the fire get away from me don't touch me how much intelligence do
[14978.33s -> 15003.38s]  i actually have without the rune 63 what the fuck man that sucks you see four i need 68
[15004.42s -> 15012.78s]  the rune is five yeah but i don't want to have to rely on the rune to do a cast of spell that i have
[15013.98s -> 15033.59s]  all right let's go do this hey content let me check up here first though what does this say
[15033.59s -> 15047.62s]  thing held shut by a seal so i'm assuming the seal is going to be this thing this is the oh
[15047.62s -> 15058.76s]  turn on light the fire is here in the ever jail your thing oh now everybody's real i get it
[15062.25s -> 15070.46s]  all the people we've seen lying around they're now gonna get up i get it that makes sense
[15071.10s -> 15111.11s]  all right light the four seals this illusion you can shoot through walls okay you can shoot
[15111.11s -> 15130.58s]  straight down you can literally shoot straight down through walls that's not that's fun well now
[15130.58s -> 15144.23s]  i'm coming for you motherfucker now i'm coming for you with my swift lint stone maybe just jump can
[15144.23s -> 15166.12s]  i use the horse in there i'll just jump up there um so they're on the roofs they're on the roofs
[15168.57s -> 15198.84s]  so on each roof i use the horse no no horse allowed there's one right here you can't really
[15198.84s -> 15245.94s]  get a lock on this one okay this is one okay um i got there the whole time dude so i'm gonna
[15245.94s -> 15263.59s]  just say okay this is not that big so i'm not that concerned but that was a lot why the assassin's
[15263.59s -> 15271.75s]  coming for me what did i ever do i know how to fight them though swing in a random direction
[15271.75s -> 15295.56s]  until you hit them and just don't stop swinging just going straight down assassin nope that's
[15300.26s -> 15312.38s]  i focus just came out of my nose i hope they're not on camera okay imagine getting like attacked
[15312.38s -> 15317.91s]  and just saying that saying the thing like the person that's attacking you out loud like i was
[15317.91s -> 15323.02s]  calling for help i was making a call out to my teammates that there was a black knife assassin
[15323.02s -> 15327.10s]  right here look at the blip on the mini map look at my blip on the mini map there's a black knife
[15327.10s -> 15332.79s]  assassin right here because even if i died two or three of my teammates would know oh shit all
[15332.79s -> 15350.06s]  right we're going there fuck oh it's you again all right they stay lit somebody said i just have to
[15350.06s -> 15364.97s]  run they stay lit okay yeah the play is run i don't who cares about any items i have a plus 10 baby
[15364.97s -> 15374.09s]  rattle and like the staff i don't do i really need another two rune arcs no just sprint don't
[15374.09s -> 15380.09s]  stop running and if a black knife assassin shows up just spam l1 over and over again and if you die
[15380.09s -> 15408.78s]  who cares okay go don't don't stop where are they there's one there's that one i got already
[15409.34s -> 15442.07s]  i'm just gonna go in a direction i'm going that way one over here give me the fuck away from me
[15442.87s -> 15497.16s]  how do i how do i get up there to go across there i see him walking into the snow what
[15497.64s -> 15523.93s]  where's his footprints i think i just bumped into him stupid oh my god it's so nerve-wracking
[15524.65s -> 15546.60s]  all right but hold on nothing changes in this dumb ass town i just go into the spirit world
[15546.60s -> 15552.70s]  so let me block out where i need to go so because the architect it's the same architecture
[15553.74s -> 15563.77s]  so i gotta go up there so how do i get from here to there to get okay this has a ladder that goes
[15563.77s -> 15571.37s]  up i got to get up on this roof in particular this one here now what's the way to get up here
[15571.37s -> 15594.41s]  on foot we're here here how do you get up here from the ground the ladder right there
[15596.47s -> 15608.30s]  is there a ladder ladder here how do you get here there okay so it's jump to here jump to there
[15609.26s -> 15616.06s]  and then go up and there's one right there all right let me just let me make sure i can do this
[15619.66s -> 15639.91s]  okay i can make that jump i made that one before as well i made that jump before double check hold
[15639.91s -> 15660.57s]  on what about on this wait maybe that's not a reliable jump what about over here
[15662.33s -> 15682.09s]  and get can i get up here any other easier way but this way maybe okay this is more reliable
[15682.09s -> 15694.20s]  so where is this mark this keep this marked it's right there it's this little spot right here
[15694.84s -> 15705.46s]  right on the edge so climb up there and i have access to the whole roof all right that's what's
[15705.46s -> 15718.31s]  gonna happen good luck trying to fucking remember my like two-year-old object permanence good luck
[15718.31s -> 15727.61s]  remembering where that is even with it's marked on the map in fact it came off it's over there
[15728.41s -> 15735.78s]  why is that so far away what are you talking about why is it so far in the distance oh that's four
[15735.78s -> 15750.49s]  where's one there it is okay so now let's go it's all the same like green and gray building
[15751.21s -> 15779.34s]  okay so from here from here i gotta turn it and just run straight that way right over there
[15806.65s -> 15811.13s]  okay can i can i follow me up the lot he's right there he's literally at the bottom of the ladder
[15811.13s -> 15848.39s]  he's climbing right now he's on the ladder right now right there on the ladder what do i do so is
[15848.39s -> 15865.40s]  they gonna climb the ladder i swear to god i thought i saw footprints it's two so from here
[15865.40s -> 15876.30s]  i can jump around where's the guy with the bow and arrow okay don't even think about it you
[15876.30s -> 15904.66s]  motherfucker don't even think about it where are you dude like okay god no no we're not doing it
[15904.66s -> 15944.39s]  like that oh there's another one shooting at me from another distance away from me
[15945.27s -> 15967.11s]  oh this is not gonna work oh my god i thought that was one oh my goodness just have to run
[15967.99s -> 15977.19s]  you actually just have to run i guess i could cheese somebody said with a bow but i got two
[15978.07s -> 15984.23s]  i just gotta run how are you reliably supposed to get how are you supposed to do that reliably
[15984.79s -> 15995.74s]  that's like a that's yikes how are you supposed to do that okay let's go i feel like with enough to
[15995.74s -> 16001.85s]  just running might be i think it's that's the way to do it run as fast as you can hold the shield
[16001.85s -> 16009.21s]  up if you need to and run and just jump and just pray that you don't get hit you can put on the
[16009.21s -> 16027.14s]  special armor i can use the terrain to block out the shots right for instance like i can just stay
[16027.14s -> 16035.62s]  right here and i won't get hit by anything so where's the route the route is run jump jump
[16035.86s -> 16059.48s]  to that balcony right there jump to that one and around the building go why am i fat rolling
[16059.48s -> 16071.62s]  what's what's going on why am i fat rolling what happened i'm dead he's gonna fucking stab me what
[16071.62s -> 16080.50s]  the fuck man how do i it's a it's a tiny little shield just stab me just kill me already i'm fat
[16080.50s -> 16088.84s]  rolling unbelievable this shield is made out of aluminum foil there's no way that it weighs that
[16088.84s -> 16122.90s]  much this thing is i'm fine relax don't i have a spell that makes it it blocks like a lot of
[16122.90s -> 16128.71s]  damage magic damage or something i wish i could use the fucking moon but i don't have 800
[16128.71s -> 16191.88s]  intelligence crouch crouch what am i supposed to do about this do i even have a bow okay can i even
[16191.88s -> 16220.42s]  equip this holy bow which one's better this is probably all right i got a bow on this is expensive
[16220.42s -> 16244.17s]  wait i think i'm safe oh i think i'm safe right here yep i think so don't move nobody fucking move

[21687.30s -> 21727.98s]  mog i'll let him take the elden ring dearest michaela best to the love of our dynasty
[21734.65s -> 21745.90s]  serpent he's over there you and me right here right let's go right here you hit me in the
[21745.90s -> 21772.06s]  fucking forearm ow let's get him okay that's slow that's pretty slow
[21776.50s -> 21801.45s]  okay that's a huge overhead swing throws like blood at you oh that hurts that's good
[21802.25s -> 21886.97s]  gotta get that down ugly what is that oh god what's this he just he healed he heals at that stage
[21886.97s -> 21895.48s]  okay all right i think i'm gonna save the i'm gonna save serpent use the shackle
[21896.04s -> 21905.08s]  i'm gonna wait to bring serpent in because he looked like he started that was transition to
[21905.08s -> 21923.69s]  phase two hopefully the game didn't crash i feel like it did i think so yes it did okay well
[21924.65s -> 21947.03s]  uh i'll be right back i'm gonna reload the game please don't fuck up my save that's cool though
[21947.03s -> 21956.23s]  that's a cool fight so that's halid tree and i don't know what are they all what are they all
[21956.23s -> 21971.16s]  doing here so i'm what i'm gonna do try to get to phase two bring the serpent out and then
[21972.04s -> 21981.10s]  i'm just imagining you have to run i'm imagining that when he starts to do that thing when he the
[21981.10s -> 21992.46s]  bloody you just have to run the fuck away as far as you can all right yeah we're good let's go you
[21992.46s -> 22009.56s]  see i also could level up my staff to plus 10 which i probably i've read yeah i mean why would
[22009.56s -> 22032.44s]  i not do that this guy this guy's crazy apparently let's do that ancient flask um i think it's fine
[22032.44s -> 22044.65s]  for now this is very important okay here we go sombra ancient dragon smithing stone
[22045.53s -> 22059.53s]  we're at the maximum scaling on this weapon 321 so my moves are gonna be way better now and wait
[22059.53s -> 22070.97s]  didn't i get i need a great grave glove for it i think serpent is the call though i do i thought
[22070.97s -> 22086.18s]  that was gonna be way more expensive i just wasted that run all right uh over here are there any
[22086.18s -> 22100.76s]  romance options um i don't think so let's see if i can get them down to at least like 30 40 percent
[22100.76s -> 22123.61s]  on my own what's that i can send it back down i always forget to do this all right let's go
[22124.09s -> 22134.94s]  let's try it he's gonna send like five moons at him immediately the very beginning
[22134.94s -> 22162.42s]  pretty shit that was fucking incredible slow very slow way slower than i gotta hold on wait
[22184.78s -> 22248.50s]  i'll just do that fucking thing is so slow oh that was dumb i'll never it's gonna take me like
[22248.50s -> 22263.38s]  five more tries to get the like here it comes i'm just trying to get some ingredients do like a
[22263.38s -> 22294.87s]  fucking chunk on him all right watch out get out get out get out get out get out you're gonna do
[22294.87s -> 22304.97s]  the thing what the fuck how far away do you have to be how far away do you have to be
[22307.45s -> 22321.08s]  how far away do you have to be let's just hit you everywhere there's no you can't run from it
[22321.08s -> 22328.49s]  is unlimited range you just have really holy shit okay that well all right okay all right
[22331.75s -> 22339.98s]  use the shackle when he does oh that's a good idea isn't it i have the thing i don't know why
[22339.98s -> 22362.18s]  i'm not using it how many times can i use it all right i also have to first one not hit him
[22387.19s -> 22392.09s]  i i get i gotta take off some of these spells having to go tap tap tap tap tap like five times
[22392.09s -> 22407.90s]  to get the spell i want i gotta get rid of some of these fucking useless ones three hit combo or
[22407.90s -> 22480.46s]  is it a two greed is so real on this some of this shit i'm standing in this goo oh my god that's a
[22480.46s -> 22493.43s]  fucking wall behind me is there yes there is all right i think i gotta i gotta get rid of some of
[22493.43s -> 22504.25s]  these spells i'm never gonna use like star all right like starlight swift glint stone
[22504.25s -> 22511.43s]  zamora's wind store i just want three two spells i don't want to have to be like okay i did my moon
[22511.43s -> 22579.14s]  and now oh there it is okay oh oh got it you oh my god his fucking reach and timing suck
[22579.94s -> 22593.45s]  i gotta give him a phase two before i can even jesus yeah that overhead swing his arm extends
[22593.45s -> 22600.09s]  like five times longer than his arm actually is he stretch armstrongs his arm 50 feet in front of
[22600.09s -> 22614.44s]  him fucking piece of shit i can do two and that's it get two of these right that'll frost him
[22621.58s -> 22627.16s]  it literally did it the last time i did it actually did it the last time i just did it
[22627.16s -> 22684.74s]  why what the fuck happened oh shit don't get greedy all right here he goes here he goes
[22685.38s -> 22694.58s]  so i have to heal through this wait i have a shackle i'm gonna use the shackle let's see what
[22694.58s -> 22749.46s]  works yeah it didn't do anything it didn't do anything oh my god he turned and punched me in the
[22749.46s -> 22776.41s]  face dude dodge the attacks bro do you see what this motherfucker's doing on the screen
[22780.34s -> 22788.97s]  so much of the attacks dude what you really should try to do is dodge the attacks are you
[22788.97s -> 22802.36s]  sure i shouldn't shouldn't fucking run at him and stand still all right he's doing a shit
[22802.36s -> 22812.17s]  load of blood i feel like this guy's really hard i need some more help here what is he's doing like
[22812.17s -> 22828.30s]  blood damage what's like the highest immunity thing in the game is it worth putting this stuff
[22828.30s -> 22850.74s]  on the shackle only works in the first phase what about one of these headshots crits blood loss
[22850.74s -> 22869.85s]  wait what about that i i mean he does fire this is okay this is immunity you shackle while he's
[22869.85s -> 22877.38s]  casting it definitely you'll definitely have a lot of blood loss yeah raise immunity and then i'll
[22877.38s -> 22887.08s]  put on some immunity shit this is okay what about this give me something better like five
[22888.12s -> 22906.22s]  because that's killing me that's doing so much damage all right these are low immunity 44 that's
[22906.22s -> 22924.98s]  heavy load though i gotta be careful 39 44 i don't think i'm gonna see more than 44
[22933.26s -> 22944.28s]  um this is i think a good either way just has a lot read read robustness not immunity for bleed
[22944.92s -> 22961.48s]  oh oh oops all right well that's pretty robust that's robust that's robust that's very robust
[22961.48s -> 22986.50s]  that's what i had on 35 34 39 it's literally the same fucking clothes i just had on
[22994.20s -> 23000.55s]  all right so shackle only works in phase one let's see what it does i just curious what it does
[23001.11s -> 23017.37s]  what's going on all right shackle okay i mean that's how often can i use that
[23020.36s -> 23030.12s]  oh i can use it like a bunch of times in a row holy shit let's do this i use it like
[23030.12s -> 23041.40s]  can i use it you can only do it twice oh it's fire damage too all right i kind of
[23041.40s -> 23044.76s]  fucked this whole thing up didn't i can't do it more than once okay you can only do it twice
[23044.76s -> 23057.34s]  it's is it really even worth doing maybe not honestly i gotta get the timing to be swings
[23058.14s -> 23064.23s]  they're like markets just like sometimes it just takes like an extra second to swing down
[23066.57s -> 23072.55s]  it's actually been a while since i've been fighting an enemy like this yeah it's even longer
[23074.07s -> 23083.22s]  let me just try to get some timings down we're gonna do some practice runs here
[23091.06s -> 23093.94s]  somebody's so quick to fuck you
[23113.50s -> 23133.37s]  all right then he does the fire shit you got it back away from the fire all right there it is
[23134.57s -> 23163.11s]  okay that's a lot faster than than the other one is you throw that far just trying to practice
[23163.91s -> 23210.50s]  okay i got it down something he does three sometimes though he's got do i have to scream
[23210.50s -> 23215.70s]  it from the mountaintops that this is a practice run to learn the mechanics of the fight i'm not
[23215.70s -> 23221.94s]  trying to hurt anybody i'm trying to simply learn the mechanics of the fight gordon mr freeman
[23233.56s -> 23246.63s]  he started with okay is fine there's a whole second phase of different different moves
[23247.82s -> 23255.53s]  i know what look we got we can we got a crawl before we can run i can't i gotta reliably be
[23255.53s -> 23262.26s]  able to get him down to 50 you're the funniest guy on twitch what happened i didn't do anything
[23263.22s -> 23285.40s]  all right first of all i gotta do two moons what happened to them dude please like holding y and
[23285.40s -> 23295.43s]  pressing r1 sucks such ass sometimes god i gotta go to god damn bonfire this is infuriating having
[23295.43s -> 23398.36s]  to do that come on mogwin can i truly hit him during this how fast does he go i got startled
[23398.36s -> 23426.17s]  from the thing it does a second attack the fire on the ground is such poor shit it just makes it
[23426.17s -> 23432.68s]  makes like trying to fight him so much fucking harder he just puts it's just like that little
[23432.68s -> 23440.41s]  fire on the ground where you just like uh uh uh uh that was much better that was actually progress
[23441.70s -> 23442.58s]  oh i'm gonna keep at it
[23474.71s -> 23484.18s]  no i didn't want to do that that fucked the whole thing up that was such a great start too
[23486.20s -> 23494.50s]  i got it don't worry i got it that's a fourth attack sometimes you just don't do that
[23494.50s -> 23500.87s]  you just don't do that sometimes it's always so fucking annoying you don't do that sometimes
[23501.51s -> 23520.34s]  it's a lot weird right now i'm just so mad at this stupid bullshit moves
[23562.14s -> 23579.70s]  boys oh fuck boys so bad i i that was not me fucking around i really wanted to try to get them
[23579.70s -> 23586.58s]  out that would have been awesome i probably should do it right when he's done with the
[23587.46s -> 23590.90s]  heal though all right i'm making progress i got it i got it i'm making progress don't
[23590.90s -> 23636.73s]  worry check this out fuck he doesn't start with that usually dude oh my god oh give me a
[23636.81s -> 23648.38s]  fucking break he did the same overhead smash twice in a row oh this guy sucks ass
[23651.24s -> 23657.83s]  i no no here's what we're doing i'm taking all these useless fucking spells off so i don't have
[23657.83s -> 23662.47s]  to go one two three four five six to get to the next goddamn spell if i want to do the moon i'm
[23662.47s -> 23666.71s]  gonna do the moon if i want to do the slash i'm gonna slash i'm not gonna skip through seven
[23666.71s -> 23672.55s]  fucking spells get rid of them all i don't want any of them on the i don't want any of them remove
[23672.55s -> 23679.11s]  remove remove remove remove these are only two gosh darn spells that i need on this gosh darn
[23679.11s -> 23690.15s]  bar okay i don't want to sit there and do a move and then go okay i got it gosh darn it i'm getting
[23690.15s -> 23723.83s]  really really hated all right wait wait wait wait wait one of these should i do one of these
[23723.83s -> 23734.60s]  you're like driving with no shoes on and what do you what do you mean how is this how is this
[23734.60s -> 23745.29s]  driving without shoes on what's that supposed to mean you don't do the magic like i feel like
[23745.29s -> 23752.76s]  i know what you're talking about like it's weird to drive you know you can but it's not good like
[23752.76s -> 23766.81s]  i gotta suck okay drive with shoes on what i have a damage boost you don't really boost magic attack
[23766.81s -> 23794.15s]  what about one that boosts all damage no winged crystal tier i don't know what else maybe flame
[23794.79s -> 23803.22s]  flame one maybe sounds good do the exploding one i'm not just gonna blow myself up i think this
[23803.22s -> 23810.47s]  one's the best i think this one's good plus the infinite fp1 yeah all right we'll get here's what
[23810.47s -> 23818.63s]  we're gonna do you ready walk in the door drink flask moon moon moon it's gonna take out half his
[23818.63s -> 23837.78s]  goddamn health bar all right let's go yeah drink the flask go in the door just spam moons until he
[23837.78s -> 23844.97s]  gets too close that's the play it is and then shackle so moon moon moon moon moon shackle drink
[23844.97s -> 23849.64s]  drink drink i got it ruin arc not yet i'm not comfortable with i'm not confident with the second
[23849.64s -> 23858.71s]  phase yet i am barely 60 confident in the first phase we're not quite there yet not quite there
[23858.71s -> 23870.52s]  for a ruin arc here we go ready i can just spam it so we're just gonna fucking do it if he walks
[23870.60s -> 23894.26s]  into it he walks into it shackle didn't work how did the shackle not work that's a really good
[23894.26s -> 23899.54s]  opener though it actually is like the best opener i can do how come i couldn't shackle it i'm so
[23899.54s -> 23902.42s]  confused right now this is like fucking up the whole thing this is throwing me off so bad
[23904.02s -> 23913.22s]  how did it not work okay well i that just threw me off so bad he was in the middle of an animation
[23915.38s -> 23932.06s]  that was a good opener i just i expected him to go down and he didn't so i can't do it immediately
[23932.06s -> 23935.90s]  i have to wait till he's done and he's like attacked being hit animation and then do the
[23935.90s -> 23948.73s]  shackle just r1 i that's not gonna happen like that straight up isn't happening i don't do nearly
[23948.73s -> 23967.58s]  as much damage with an r1 against this guy it does i do like a fucking 120 okay here we go
[23968.22s -> 23991.06s]  good to go that's a good start you know what bring in the boys right now go go go we're throwing a

[25321.10s -> 25327.18s]  phase change before you have to drink should i just go just wail on them with um with sorcery

[26192.41s -> 26202.90s]  friends list uh all five of the boys just went down to till a little bit lower i've been spending
[26202.90s -> 26206.74s]  way more time with the snake it's not it's like natural to like kind of drift apart from other
[26206.74s -> 26214.04s]  friends right being the snake i've been hanging out a lot and it's like i'll call the boys
[26214.04s -> 26219.43s]  sometimes when i want to hang out but i mean i'm just i've been spending more time with the snake
[26221.86s -> 26238.04s]  oh my god that sucked and that's not even the hard one oh i did this first try i'm not kidding
[26238.04s -> 26244.44s]  you are a god some of those timings are so hard especially when you start bumping into gravestones
[26244.44s -> 26251.08s]  which by the way why are there so many of these up here it's just that all these gravestones
[26251.64s -> 26258.46s]  there's no places to bury anybody why are there so many gravestones it's just like
[26260.14s -> 26281.77s]  they're all your deaths yeah you made that joke two weeks ago you can't make that joke again but
[26281.77s -> 26285.53s]  you said snakes were unpredictable they are that's why they're so good at this fight because
[26285.53s -> 26291.77s]  mogg come on gwen it how he couldn't deal with it how are you supposed to deal with somebody
[26291.77s -> 26301.18s]  that just stands in the corner and goes like this it's weird it's like what you're doing is
[26301.26s -> 26308.06s]  weird so i'm like i'm kind of i'm gonna step back for a second all right uh that's definitely the
[26308.06s -> 26315.32s]  end of the stream by the way like i'm going fucking bad is there anything i can do here
[26315.32s -> 26342.07s]  that was a funny ending well hold on i'm not quite hold on a second i want to go see what that is
[26342.71s -> 26349.27s]  what else did i got i got his resemblance but i also i got something else too what was the other
[26349.27s -> 26359.72s]  thing oh the rune mogg's great room seek the divine tower of east atlas which stands beyond
[26359.72s -> 26363.80s]  the great bridge from lindell's eastern ward seek the divine tower of west atlas

[26433.40s -> 26451.74s]  augwin's sacred spear blood boon faith and arcane scatters blood flame before caster to set area of
[26451.74s -> 26464.42s]  flame mother of truth craves wounds when mog stood before her deep underground his accursed blood
[26464.42s -> 26468.82s]  erupted with fire and he was bestowed with the defilement that he was born into
[26469.86s -> 26476.04s]  frightened of mog lord of blood a sacred spirit that will come to symbolize his dynasty
[26476.76s -> 26480.20s]  as well as serving as a weapon it is an instrument of communion with an outer god
[26480.20s -> 26489.85s]  who bestows power upon a cursed blood mother of truth desires a wound well arcane and strength
[26489.85s -> 26502.14s]  is not this character at all use that instead of the baby rattle i would have to respect the
[26502.14s -> 26529.80s]  entire character respect to use this i don't think so whoa royal knight helm veteran's helm
[26530.68s -> 26544.78s]  anselm veteran's armor royal knight this this is good this is really good
[26545.74s -> 26552.66s]  is that better than what i have on i know that is but this is heavy though that's way too heavy
[26552.66s -> 26575.35s]  i'm not sure i can put that on lord of blood i might just i mean i have enough runes maybe i
[26575.35s -> 26581.83s]  was by this one's 15 what is it okay 16 14 how am i how is this compared to the scale scale armor
[26582.39s -> 26590.23s]  remember the beach hat the beach hat boost cold sorceries i need to use it
[26591.83s -> 26596.47s]  i'm gonna break this i'm not gonna use either one of the items so i'm just gonna smash it
[26598.04s -> 26611.35s]  bye see you later mog it was great but level up probably two more times what's with the stream
[26611.35s -> 26625.26s]  title oh i don't know is a like ipad game joke or something okay let me look at what is it 16 13
[26625.26s -> 26655.29s]  16 16 16 13 so this is better oh all right cool put this on royal knight armor oh that's cool
[26658.65s -> 26663.69s]  i'd lose a lot of resistances but i gained some more physical defense so how does it look
[26664.33s -> 26681.42s]  that looks pretty awesome yeah put it on heavy load royal knight i actually look kind of cool now
[26682.38s -> 26706.28s]  it actually fits it matches pretty cool all right let's do need a little bit more time is it
[26706.28s -> 26722.28s]  midnight what if i just said fuck it and kept going really a little while not that much not

[26786.70s -> 26795.98s]  the games are you better believe that i'm i'm coming with some real classics i don't want to
[26796.70s -> 26799.98s]  give it away but i'm telling you right now i think i have a pretty good chance of winning
[26800.78s -> 26814.30s]  very good chance i think all right uh what was i just doing i can put the spells back on because
[26814.30s -> 26832.74s]  i don't i don't i i kind of freaked out here didn't i i want to try this and starlight okay
[26835.38s -> 26843.53s]  i want to go talk to gideon i want to activate the rune talk to gideon because at this point
[26844.58s -> 26854.70s]  dude i got i'm it's me it's it's me uh here we go oh so that's where the so-called lord was
[26854.70s -> 26861.82s]  hiding himself there a fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of
[26861.82s -> 26869.00s]  his precious dynasty while he turns our fellow tarnished into bloody fingers let him stay there
[26869.00s -> 26878.58s]  away his delusions will remain as they are distant and unattainable but perhaps it's worth looking
[26878.58s -> 26888.09s]  into if what i've heard is right then maybe my apologies lost myself for a moment there
[26888.73s -> 26896.90s]  the information you shared is of great value that's promised your reward it is a wondrous
[26896.90s -> 26905.10s]  thing indeed you are a true fellow all i ask is that you remain constant
[26907.78s -> 26916.94s]  you gave me a cookbook fucking cookbook dude i have slayed every demon and every tarnished
[26916.94s -> 26922.52s]  every monster in this whole world and you're gonna give me grandma's meatball recipe is that
[26922.52s -> 26929.24s]  really what you're doing you're gonna show me that how to make fucking lasagna you don't have
[26929.24s -> 26933.08s]  a weapon under there that has a magical fucking juice on it or something that's unbelievable
[26934.68s -> 26949.80s]  a cookbook this better be this better be good where is it it is a wondrous thing indeed okay
[26949.80s -> 26974.55s]  what is it bewitching branch uses fp to charm pierced enemy here's a foe using fp to turn them
[26974.55s -> 26994.02s]  into a temporary ally but actually that is really good well what is it i see so nicola was with the
[26994.02s -> 27000.04s]  lord of blood after all that is some fine intelligence indeed it's pretty high with it
[27000.76s -> 27006.65s]  the far clue has been brought into the light what is it one of the last few pieces the round table
[27007.45s -> 27016.09s]  i need to put everything together as promised allow me to impart to you the last of the secret
[27016.09s -> 27030.49s]  rights normally to me close the door law of causality if he continues his slumber within
[27030.49s -> 27039.86s]  the cocoon it would be safer to destroy it nicola is the one thing that remains a mystery to me
[27046.14s -> 27053.34s]  well there are four more demigods yet to be located uh nicola of the hey i just killed him
[27053.34s -> 27060.82s]  it's twin millennia no i didn't the undefeated lunar princess rani and he has said so here above
[27060.82s -> 27071.72s]  you should learn anything i'll trade you fine oh as such okay so interesting if i go load that
[27071.72s -> 27091.56s]  area what happens to be dead there i need to turn these on right i have a couple that are just not
[27091.56s -> 27109.59s]  on one of them was an atlas right okay this is divine tower of west atlas divine tower of east
[27109.59s -> 27139.94s]  atlas easy enough oh okay already been yeah it's oh more gods okay the hardest boss in any souls
[27139.94s -> 27150.34s]  game i know i know and dude like i don't know hogs great runes so what do you do with this
[27150.98s -> 27159.51s]  grants a blessing of blood to phantoms it's a blessing of blood to summoned phantoms and
[27159.51s -> 27166.95s]  imparts a phantom great rune upon successful invasion hog and margot are twin brothers and
[27166.95s -> 27172.86s]  their great runes are naturally similar the mogs rune is soaked in a cursed blood from his devout
[27172.86s -> 27182.10s]  love for the wretched mire that he was born into what does this do makes you your summons to do
[27182.10s -> 27188.58s]  cool shit when they get kills pvp buff uh okay uh all right let's go to the other one the other one
[27188.58s -> 27202.86s]  was over here what was it west atlas stands upon the precipice at the coast southwest of lendell
[27203.42s -> 27230.79s]  that's right here okay how do i get there you go through the cave in here what is this
[27231.83s -> 27237.74s]  it should be a church okay i have a question for everybody that's played through this game and that
[27237.74s -> 27256.97s]  has knows everything about it if i cannot i can't go this way um if i go to that mountaintop where
[27256.97s -> 27263.22s]  the giants are and i go to that big scary thing am i going to lock myself out of doing anything
[27263.22s -> 27292.90s]  else oh okay what about no okay no you have to you lock yourself out of an ending you lock yourself
[27292.90s -> 27297.38s]  out getting some items that's okay i don't think i care i'm at this point i'm pretty locked in
[27309.58s -> 27319.66s]  not major you don't lock yourself out okay all right well let's i want to see it i want to know
[27319.66s -> 27326.57s]  what happens do we need to go i need to go this way probably better to do this
[27327.53s -> 27341.93s]  yeah i'm not gonna do everything that's possible i have second third fourth fifth playthroughs
[27341.93s -> 27346.73s]  eventually do that i'll do on my own and i encourage you to do different things too
[27348.20s -> 27359.08s]  because the game obviously is supposed to be played through a magnitude of times the area
[27359.16s -> 27374.10s]  after that that you get locked out of okay i did not come here minor urtree church
[27376.23s -> 27379.91s]  that would have been nice if i had had this because this is definitely a sacred tier
[27382.23s -> 27390.02s]  it's not a sacred tier what the hell is it golden order seal like a faith weapon
[27390.02s -> 27400.07s]  i look like a faith weapon yeah it is boost fundamentalist incantations fundamentalism
[27400.07s -> 27415.30s]  okay cool well how would you rate this game i really don't even know it's r2
[27418.42s -> 27433.37s]  okay i think it's probably the new standard for what people would consider like a great
[27434.49s -> 27441.34s]  unbelievable video game i think it'll probably end up being the standard if not a standard of
[27441.34s -> 27457.35s]  like video game it's not perfect i don't think by any means uh but it's pretty damn it's pretty
[27457.35s -> 27471.08s]  damn close i would say it's probably yeah i would say it's probably the game of the decade
[27472.95s -> 27477.83s]  it's sort of a culmination of okay well it has a thing if you don't like from software games
[27479.10s -> 27487.66s]  and you're gonna be like dude you're an idiot like this game's not as good as um skyrim but i mean
[27487.66s -> 27502.79s]  hold on it's gonna come back and go wrap around get off the horse i didn't i want to do so much
[27502.79s -> 27513.59s]  sooner than that i'm brain is just slow just tired here okay there have been times in this
[27513.59s -> 27522.28s]  game where i looked around and said it is too much to do i'm standing right here there's times i've
[27522.28s -> 27526.20s]  opened the map and i'm going like there's way too much to do i don't even know what to do
[27529.83s -> 27537.42s]  so when you get to that stage where each area and each place you're going to is so overwhelmingly
[27537.50s -> 27543.16s]  large with stuff to look at and stuff to do i mean there's no i don't i can't think of
[27543.16s -> 27549.40s]  a game that did that to me in the last 10 years where i was actually truly overwhelmed by the
[27549.40s -> 27556.60s]  video game truly like i don't know about this this is kind of this is so inspiring i don't
[27556.60s -> 27562.44s]  know what to do where do i go look at the tree there's a tree over there it's been an incredibly
[27562.44s -> 27576.86s]  long time am i not gonna be able to hurt this last time i had that feelings when i played dark
[27576.86s -> 27584.33s]  souls for the first time yeah but i this is better than dark souls i know people probably
[27584.33s -> 27590.25s]  gonna be mad at me for that i think but it is just isn't i'm so bad at this i can't even
[27590.25s -> 27596.62s]  comprehend why i'm doing this so poorly but it's it's unfair to say that because this is
[27596.62s -> 27623.78s]  this is just dark souls 5.0 did it leave the thing fucking left oh here it is
[27624.58s -> 27643.02s]  very full strike okay cool um because everybody needs to please be honest please be honest with
[27643.02s -> 27650.63s]  yourselves and with me and i'll be honest too this is this is just this is dark souls like it's just
[27650.63s -> 27657.35s]  the game is the video game not the world not the pieces not the individual parts the video game
[27657.35s -> 27664.70s]  here is dark souls it's just dark souls it's that's just what it is there is almost no difference to
[27664.70s -> 27669.58s]  how this plays to dark souls they're the almost the exact same video game so saying that like
[27669.58s -> 27672.70s]  dark souls 1 is better is kind of hard because or dark souls 3 or whatever is
[27673.98s -> 27683.82s]  they just made a better version here it is at least in my opinion right because
[27683.82s -> 27688.14s]  secura was a lot different even though it had the same kind of similar themes and stuff it was a
[27688.14s -> 27695.91s]  wildly different game i feel like i'm playing dark souls 3 right now like kind of like a better
[27695.91s -> 27722.90s]  version of it in a way illusion wall over here right here please destroy that baldkins blessing
[27723.70s -> 27736.87s]  do i have i don't have i don't have a blessing i don't have a baldkins blessing how does this
[27736.87s -> 27745.93s]  compare to half-life alex they're both like kind of huge huge like generational leaps of video
[27745.93s -> 27754.07s]  games for me because this is almost everything i wanted dark souls to be i loved playing dark
[27754.07s -> 27760.31s]  souls 3 i love bloodborne i loved i didn't love the hero but you know let's just say it we'll
[27760.31s -> 27763.91s]  just say because it's the whole family and we can't just say we don't love a certain family members
[27764.87s -> 27771.08s]  uh but what was it what was it going where was it what was it just saying like a one second ago
[27771.64s -> 27776.14s]  before that what was the last thing that i just said i actually fucking don't remember
[27781.21s -> 27792.71s]  what did i say half-life okay okay okay okay half-life alex is also kind of one of those games
[27792.71s -> 27800.81s]  that is just like a generational game that's the best version of vr games that exist because most
[27800.81s -> 27808.95s]  vr games don't do it very well i still think this is better i think this is better than alex
[27810.07s -> 27819.62s]  because it's more the type of game that i like to play i love upgrades i love character progression
[27820.26s -> 27824.10s]  i like real character progression not fake horse shit character progression
[27824.74s -> 27831.54s]  where your character's moves are not hidden behind a skill tree i don't like arbitrary dumb
[27831.54s -> 27840.36s]  stupid shitty skill trees i like real character progression item progression tons of it i like
[27840.36s -> 27846.68s]  when games don't kind of i like when you have to kind of figure stuff out like asking you guys how
[27846.68s -> 27855.14s]  to kill bog uh this is a game that i like more than a game that i like i like this more than
[27855.14s -> 27867.61s]  i like vr games let's put it that way and the here's the worst part about okay the worst part
[27867.61s -> 27872.60s]  about being a big fan of games like this is realistically there's really only one company
[27872.60s -> 27880.87s]  that makes it it's like the it's this fine wine that is so delicious and so wonderful that you're
[27880.87s -> 27884.71s]  like holy shit when they're done when i hope they don't go out of business for any reason
[27884.71s -> 27888.15s]  because that's my favorite wine and i'm never going to get it anywhere else then no one will
[27888.15s -> 27894.82s]  ever get the same flavor ever again people have tried right people make souls like games but
[27894.82s -> 27901.37s]  they're not even close they're not even close some of them have come kind of close have been
[27901.37s -> 27909.14s]  hold on there are some that have come kind of close they're they're fun they're interesting
[27909.14s -> 27922.28s]  but i just they just don't do it the same way for me and for all the things that i would say about
[27922.28s -> 27938.31s]  this game for all the things that i could say nobody really does it the same way every time
[27938.31s -> 27957.40s]  i've played one what was the point of doing that there's nothing there oh it was a stone
[27959.03s -> 27969.83s]  oh what kind of stone yeah fucking me strong we'll get it kind of want to try this
[27975.32s -> 27980.52s]  oh yeah when you see in golden ruin fives i can buy that thing in the store for probably a thousand
[27980.52s -> 27995.42s]  souls i don't really need it yeah nobody quite nobody quite doesn't like this and i know it's
[27995.42s -> 27999.58s]  it feels kind of bad in a way because like i i didn't like secure as much as i liked
[28000.54s -> 28007.80s]  like dark i like dark souls 3 i like bloodborne i the reason why i like dark souls 3
[28007.80s -> 28011.40s]  more than any of the other ones besides bloodborne i can't i bloodborne's like in
[28011.40s -> 28018.68s]  a grayed out area up here because 30 fps ps4 only but it's like one of my favorite games ever
[28019.64s -> 28029.22s]  but dark souls 3 the engine the 60 fps the animations are so much better the dark souls
[28029.22s -> 28033.78s]  one remaster it wasn't like didn't do it as much i wish that it was more like the demon souls
[28034.74s -> 28045.37s]  which i haven't played so what just happened died dark souls 2 copium
[28048.30s -> 28052.14s]  the newer animation style and the newer engine they started using since bloodborne
[28052.70s -> 28056.94s]  i find those games to be more fun to play i don't necessarily think that they are
[28058.07s -> 28062.87s]  wildly better video games i just think that they're more fun to physically play because
[28062.87s -> 28071.30s]  the engine is just better it's cleaner it's more fast paced it's there's more going on yeah
[28073.35s -> 28080.15s]  if you gave the dark souls 3 like demon souls engine to dark souls 1 we would have a different
[28080.15s -> 28101.35s]  conversation we're not having that conversation right now though it's a wall oh give me that
[28105.78s -> 28119.30s]  uh what a good time to get killed i want to do it let me do it the worst enemy probably
[28119.30s -> 28149.08s]  to test this on but whatever oh bounces everywhere you piece of shit really thank you for killing
[28149.56s -> 28176.82s]  dark souls 2 is bad dark souls 2 is not bad it's just messy dark souls 2 is not a bad game it's
[28176.82s -> 28196.57s]  just a mess and i had fun with dark souls 2 i didn't stream dark souls 2 but i played it i
[28196.57s -> 28204.81s]  beat it i did when they did the weird let's kind of just go into gmod and place enemies in random
[28204.81s -> 28213.24s]  places dlc expansion fucking whatever the hell that was um i played that it was all right
[28213.96s -> 28221.29s]  i thought it was fun i didn't hate it i liked how much there was to do in dark souls 2
[28221.93s -> 28232.39s]  and add good dlc yeah i did dark souls 3's dlc was really good as well i think dark souls 3 might
[28232.39s -> 28238.28s]  have dark souls 3 and bloodborne might be the best dlc of any of the from software games so far
[28248.25s -> 28254.68s]  are you still live i guess we're just going yeah bloodborne's dlc is number one and then
[28254.68s -> 28265.75s]  dark souls 3's dark souls 3's dlc is number two you like dark souls 2 i don't i don't hate dark
[28265.75s -> 28276.12s]  souls 2 i just don't think it's it's not my favorite dark souls 2 and sakiro sit down at
[28276.12s -> 28281.83s]  the same place for me sort of dark souls 1 i have to be honest i know a ton of people are like dude
[28281.83s -> 28286.39s]  how could you how could you say that dark souls 1 belongs down there it don't it doesn't belong
[28286.39s -> 28300.66s]  down there it is i mean you i you watched me play through all of sakiro i did the whole thing on
[28300.66s -> 28313.99s]  stream i did that's probably the maddest i've ever been in a video game on camera ever i feel
[28313.99s -> 28318.39s]  like i'm remembering only the bad parts of me getting mad at sakiro and not all the good parts
[28318.39s -> 28331.74s]  of me having a great time right this place is insane by the way sakiro is better than elden ring
[28332.54s -> 28336.79s]  no i just think it's the they just combined all their video games into one game and it's
[28336.79s -> 28346.58s]  just the best version of all of them now hold on though i am a big fan of a lot of content
[28347.14s -> 28351.22s]  right so i might actually going back and playing dark souls 2 i might have a different opinion
[28352.50s -> 28359.86s]  uh i've heard the complaints of this game of well when there's okay he's gonna explode
[28364.18s -> 28371.14s]  when there's so much to do and you level up it's very easy to kind of miss whole areas because the
[28371.14s -> 28376.34s]  character is too strong and you go back and it's like oh i guess i just kind of missed this entire
[28376.34s -> 28383.34s]  thing but i just like it's like i kill everything in one hit and it's kind of not fun right i
[28383.34s -> 28390.90s]  understand that aspect my only rebuttal would be just don't do it do it on a different character
[28390.90s -> 28394.42s]  and just keep going and progressive just do beat it and come back and do the other stuff you didn't
[28394.42s -> 28412.54s]  do what happened i have a feeling i'm why am i so scared of this thing i have a feeling i'm
[28412.54s -> 28426.52s]  going to kill it prime example coming up right here like i could probably just let this guy
[28426.52s -> 28435.05s]  hit me over and over again i could just probably spam r1 so like for instance that was that was
[28435.05s -> 28442.76s]  incredibly simple that was very easy right if i had come here 45 levels ago that might have been
[28442.76s -> 28447.00s]  like oh shit this is a this is a tough encounter i'm dodging i gotta watch out i just literally
[28447.00s -> 28455.88s]  slept through that um so that's what i mean by that i'm coming back and doing all this other
[28455.88s -> 28461.50s]  content that i didn't do yeah you know i don't have to be doing this right but when you have
[28461.50s -> 28469.94s]  such a huge world and um you level up a lot you're going to be way stronger than content you didn't
[28469.94s -> 28479.85s]  get to see that's the fun of it though you can come back and just wipe the floor with everything
[28481.26s -> 28487.26s]  no no it is it really is but sometimes you can feel like a few days ago maybe like a week ago
[28487.26s -> 28494.62s]  when i was streaming this i did an area that i had maybe was a week or two ago i did an area
[28495.42s -> 28499.90s]  that it was clearly like i was just wiping the fucking floor with everything it was not even
[28499.90s -> 28502.94s]  a challenge i was just walking through the area and just like hitting r1 and killing everything
[28503.91s -> 28513.53s]  um and that was like all right that's kind of cool it makes me want it makes me want to like
[28513.53s -> 28516.89s]  make a new character and just go do that and just turn around and go the other direction
[28519.38s -> 28523.62s]  like if i kill something in one hit and like i get surrounded by five enemies and i just go
[28523.62s -> 28528.39s]  like this all five of them die i'm just like all right i'm gonna come back here in another
[28528.39s -> 28538.50s]  character and i'm gonna see this content and i'm gonna see it well sometimes you want to
[28538.50s -> 28549.62s]  break from getting your head kicked in yeah no it is it's true and that's not even a complaint
[28549.62s -> 28554.07s]  that's just kind of i've seen a lot of people say that they're way under leveled for certain
[28554.07s -> 28559.11s]  places and way over leveled for certain places and when a game doesn't really tell you what to do
[28559.67s -> 28563.67s]  you can end up in scenarios where you're in one area when you're not supposed to be
[28563.67s -> 28570.22s]  way lower and then the next area you go to you're way higher um i've seen that happen a few times
[28570.86s -> 28577.69s]  that's unavoidable yeah oh yeah because there's no the game doesn't tell you where to go
[28578.25s -> 28581.69s]  but that's part of the reason why the game is so fun because you know the game's not like oh you
[28581.69s -> 28585.69s]  see that over there go there next by the way you this is all walled off you can't do anything
[28585.69s -> 28605.64s]  else why is the character such a fat ass because i have big armor on how many more of these things
[28605.64s -> 28619.64s]  exist stores hp upon defeating enemies it's good for like leveling better than auto scale yeah
[28619.64s -> 28626.73s]  scaling enemies is always a thing no i don't like that either i think they did a pretty good job
[28626.73s -> 28634.55s]  here i really do but it is a problem like this problem's for eat both things that's cool okay
[28634.55s -> 28643.00s]  i destroyed a lot of oblivion's fun yeah enemies that scale just kind of like you never feel like
[28643.00s -> 28646.68s]  you're making any real progress because you're just doing the exact same what was the point of
[28646.68s -> 28650.84s]  leveling up what's the point of having like a level system right there's no there's actually
[28650.84s -> 28656.44s]  no reason for it you just you're doing the same thing you're getting hurt and you're doing the
[28656.44s -> 28664.17s]  same amount of damage the whole game so it's actually really difficult to do a game that does
[28664.25s -> 28674.23s]  not scale that has this much content to do this is not this is an absurd amount of shit to do
[28674.23s -> 28680.22s]  so i feel like it's been pretty good so far and we're at the end of the game so you know all right
[28680.22s -> 28690.52s]  i got all the runes or at least the ones that i have in my inventory so before i turn off the
[28690.52s -> 28714.78s]  stream i think i want to see what's going on in this see this i want to know more guidance would
[28714.78s -> 28724.82s]  be better um if i'm honest um maybe but when you open the doors to limb grave for the first time
[28726.15s -> 28730.94s]  and you know when that i remember i think on stream i even said it i was sitting there going
[28730.94s -> 28740.50s]  holy shit when you understand that there you just are just go do something it's not a bunch of
[28740.50s -> 28745.50s]  indicators on the screen there's not a bunch of things telling you where to go it it hits a lot
[28745.50s -> 28752.74s]  different you get to experience it however you want and you know that the game has been crafted
[28752.74s -> 28758.63s]  to make sure that there's experiences in every single direction the grace light yeah but i mean
[28758.63s -> 28764.33s]  the grace light tip i'll be honest this is it's not this doesn't really tell you fucking anything
[28765.50s -> 28770.78s]  like there were times where i would go here like especially like i like oh uh where do i want to go
[28771.58s -> 28777.18s]  i guess down down where like there's something here did you want to show me this did you want
[28777.18s -> 28784.81s]  to show me that was it this that you were pointing to was it this it's not a great indicator or oh
[28784.81s -> 28795.32s]  my god don't fall off but yeah if you walk in that direction you will find something to do
[28800.28s -> 28803.00s]  just pick my fucking boogies out of my goddamn disgusting ass nose
[28805.64s -> 28828.73s]  at least i don't have to lose anything long-winded rant you asked what do i think of the game
[28829.77s -> 28835.21s]  i really it's been like a month i've been playing this game on stream for almost a full month over
[28835.21s -> 28843.16s]  a month i i do think it's probably one of the best games ever played without a doubt i have
[28843.16s -> 28848.97s]  some issues with it obviously you've heard the complaints but it is definitely one of the best
[28848.97s -> 28867.88s]  games to come out in the last 10 years at least at least gorge of the giants if we didn't have
[28867.88s -> 28873.83s]  gravestones it'd be a 10 out of 10 can i survive this no i gotta go like here
[28880.09s -> 28909.21s]  so what am i supposed to do with this thing so i'll walk around so this is interesting this is a
[28909.21s -> 28930.78s]  gigantic giant furnace what is why is this here it's also really cool because the game tricks you
[28930.78s -> 28939.58s]  a lot into pretending that it's way smaller than it is opening up the map in the first like 10
[28939.58s -> 28943.82s]  hours of the game and you only get this much to look at and even if you try to zoom out you're
[28943.82s -> 28957.06s]  stuck like here it's it's insane your brain cannot comprehend that was crazy every time a new fog of
[28957.06s -> 28962.74s]  war kind of was added to at the top left at the top right or whatever when i first opened up the
[28962.74s -> 28967.14s]  limb grid map i was like all right this doesn't really seem that big but i guess there's probably
[28967.14s -> 28976.49s]  a lot of content here right did not understand how big it was that was one of the coolest parts of
[28976.49s -> 28982.65s]  the game so far because they're kind of teasing how big their game actually was and of course
[28982.65s -> 28989.21s]  they're gonna flex let them they're like oh you think it's that big no take a look let them flex

[30792.49s -> 30799.82s]  his roots are so knotted in this place he was much longer if he stays here his shackles have
[30799.82s -> 30805.90s]  broken he's a free man now it's high time you put the round table behind him
[30806.70s -> 30828.15s]  oh you great great glove wart god damn it before you leave i knew you'd be back out your arms

[30834.71s -> 30841.75s]  are you going to challenge the demigods and their god to slay them and as long as you do i will
[30841.75s -> 30849.43s]  always smith your weapons it is what i wish to smith a weapon for you to slay a god
[30858.79s -> 30914.46s]  all right roger the letter letter written in a trembling hand i forgot to tell you but it seems
[30914.46s -> 30920.52s]  d has a younger brother i heard he lies in a deep sleep in the aqueduct beside the eternal city of
[30920.52s -> 30927.75s]  nocron and said he stood before the prince of death not far beyond that spot roger there are
[30927.75s -> 30945.19s]  trees on fire um sorry i couldn't he's been dead for weeks have i just knocked on out

[30972.25s -> 30984.39s]  for that i'll stay at the round table for a time i must learn all that can be taken from this place
[30985.11s -> 30990.71s]  and seal it into my memory how could i call myself the all knowing if i did any less
[30991.51s -> 30997.96s]  the pursuit of knowledge is without end for knowledge is never a thing complete
[30998.60s -> 31003.96s]  thus i maintain the mantle of all knowing you know everything perhaps the same could be said
[31003.96s -> 31011.24s]  of guidance it is to say whether we'll remain who we are once the fight is finished what do you think
[31011.96s -> 31014.81s]  as one of the spires to become elden lord
[31020.07s -> 31034.25s]  okay can i walk into the urn tree now no don't no no no

[31046.25s -> 31052.86s]  thanks regardless i'll try and talk him around next time i know he was given this great entreaty
[31053.42s -> 31061.32s]  to craft a weapon which could slay of god but think of it as a curse a fearsome curse
[31062.28s -> 31069.46s]  that's the case i'm not sure there's anything we can do
[31074.12s -> 31093.51s]  i got some bells though when i hand them in the dung eater just still hanging out
