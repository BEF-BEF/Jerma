[8.38s -> 14.03s]  Somebody said, who's your favorite Vocaloid?
[14.03s -> 25.23s]  I don't know, I didn't know there was that many.
[25.23s -> 27.66s]  You done peeing? Yeah, I am done peeing.
[27.66s -> 30.29s]  You guys ready for Pac-Man Museum?
[30.29s -> 36.86s]  I'm gonna turn it down, at least not too loud.
[36.86s -> 42.14s]  I don't even know what this is.
[42.14s -> 53.90s]  We're about to find out. Yep.
[53.90s -> 56.61s]  Alright, let me capture this.
[56.61s -> 58.85s]  Max FPS.
[58.85s -> 60.41s]  No, that's fine.
[60.41s -> 65.90s]  Uh, that's fine.
[65.90s -> 66.90s]  Borderless window, yeah.
[66.90s -> 72.46s]  Okay, it's very loud.
[72.46s -> 73.46s]  Let me turn this down first.
[73.46s -> 77.80s]  I actually can't turn it down.
[77.80s -> 83.46s]  I have to go to the source here.
[83.46s -> 84.46s]  Alright, let's get back.
[84.46s -> 97.82s]  You can't see it yet, but you will in a minute.
[97.82s -> 98.82s]  Putting it together.
[98.82s -> 104.66s]  Pac-Man.
[104.66s -> 106.93s]  Where are you?
[106.93s -> 120.95s]  There you are.
[120.95s -> 127.76s]  So, let's go.
[127.76s -> 128.76s]  What are they doing?
[128.76s -> 134.01s]  What the fuck is going on?
[135.63s -> 142.68s]  Alright.
[142.68s -> 145.86s]  Welcome to Pac-Man Museum Arcade.
[145.86s -> 150.86s]  In this arcade, you can choose coins to play a variety of Pac-Man.
[150.86s -> 153.48s]  Oh, shut them all. Everybody shut up.
[153.48s -> 154.48s]  Welcome to Pac-Man Museum Plus.
[154.48s -> 159.38s]  In this arcade, you can use coins to play a variety of Pac-Man games.
[159.38s -> 161.38s]  When you want to play a game, move in front of it and select play.
[161.38s -> 162.38s]  The game will start.
[162.38s -> 167.95s]  While in the arcade, press Y to open the menu.
[167.95s -> 178.98s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[178.98s -> 182.50s]  This place is fucking annoying.
[182.50s -> 188.19s]  I wouldn't want to be in here for more than five minutes.
[188.19s -> 194.77s]  Alright, what do they have for machines?
[194.77s -> 195.77s]  Gashapon?
[195.77s -> 199.84s]  Spend coins on the Gashapon to get here.
[199.84s -> 200.84s]  I don't know how you...
[200.84s -> 219.85s]  Is it supposed to sound like this?
[219.85s -> 220.85s]  I gotta get out of here.
[220.85s -> 225.43s]  Alright, Pac-Man, Pac-Mania.
[225.43s -> 232.62s]  Huh?
[232.62s -> 250.76s]  Okay, I was gonna say I thought it was gonna be that small.
[250.76s -> 251.76s]  Let's get a few extra lives.
[251.76s -> 262.09s]  Got him.
[262.09s -> 266.25s]  It sounds like Miku.
[266.25s -> 268.38s]  It does.
[268.38s -> 276.77s]  This sounds like Miku.
[276.77s -> 286.43s]  I can't escape that game.
[286.43s -> 288.99s]  It really sounds like Miku.
[288.99s -> 291.99s]  I feel like my voice has changed in the last hour.
[291.99s -> 320.93s]  Got him.
[320.93s -> 323.00s]  Come on, come on.
[323.00s -> 324.62s]  Come on, Gwen.
[324.62s -> 325.62s]  Come on, Gwen.
[325.62s -> 356.37s]  You can jump?
[356.37s -> 367.81s]  What? I didn't know you could jump.
[367.81s -> 383.94s]  I'm never gonna get caught by a ghost ever again.
[383.94s -> 387.42s]  One, two, three, four.
[387.42s -> 413.17s]  Ooh!
[413.17s -> 483.51s]  How do we get a cutscene?
[483.51s -> 484.51s]  This is the best song.
[484.51s -> 518.61s]  This is the best song they've ever made.
[518.61s -> 551.70s]  What the fuck was that double bounce?
[551.70s -> 560.36s]  Screen settings?
[560.36s -> 564.29s]  No, I don't want to see her teeth.
[564.29s -> 565.29s]  I want the bigger screen though.
[565.29s -> 568.58s]  That's better.
[568.58s -> 589.85s]  Are you okay?
[589.85s -> 590.85s]  Yeah.
[590.85s -> 598.81s]  I wasn't looking.
[598.81s -> 602.29s]  I wasn't looking.
[602.29s -> 604.87s]  That's fine.
[604.87s -> 614.82s]  Alright, it doesn't matter.
[614.82s -> 615.82s]  I got four style...
[615.82s -> 616.82s]  I got four coins.
[616.82s -> 619.21s]  That's it?
[619.21s -> 628.21s]  I unlocked Pac-Mania cabinet, a gold container.
[629.96s -> 631.14s]  A...
[631.14s -> 632.14s]  Okay.
[632.14s -> 633.14s]  Please.
[633.14s -> 635.14s]  I got a cabinet.
[635.14s -> 636.14s]  Okay.
[636.14s -> 637.76s]  That fucking stung.
[637.76s -> 638.76s]  Stop.
[638.76s -> 639.76s]  Stop hitting me.
[639.76s -> 640.94s]  Stop slapping me.
[640.94s -> 657.47s]  This is the original Pac-Man.
[657.47s -> 659.47s]  Play Pac-Man in time two times.
[659.47s -> 665.66s]  Do I have to do the original?
[665.66s -> 668.76s]  Pac-Land.
[668.76s -> 669.76s]  What's Pac-Land?
[669.76s -> 686.45s]  How do you play Pac-Land?
[686.45s -> 688.45s]  Oh my god, it's this fucking game.
[688.45s -> 699.50s]  To control Pac-Man, run with the end of the direction of the arrow.
[699.50s -> 700.50s]  How do you jump?
[700.50s -> 735.27s]  I feel like I'm going max speed in Oregon Trail.
[735.27s -> 738.75s]  Stop.
[738.75s -> 747.54s]  I did it?
[747.54s -> 762.67s]  Let's go.
[762.67s -> 769.84s]  God, I'm gonna play that Bugs Bunny Smash Bros. game again.
[769.84s -> 788.21s]  So is that thing down there a timer?
[788.21s -> 791.69s]  That's money.
[791.69s -> 793.69s]  Oh, that's such bullshit when that happens.
[793.69s -> 794.69s]  Absolute horseshit.
[794.69s -> 799.73s]  Just total horseshit.
[799.73s -> 800.73s]  Play multiverses again?
[800.73s -> 801.73s]  I can't.
[801.73s -> 803.03s]  They turned it off.
[803.03s -> 804.03s]  The alpha's gone now.
[804.03s -> 805.03s]  They closed it.
[806.34s -> 821.40s]  When's it release?
[821.40s -> 823.40s]  Uh, July, I think.
[823.40s -> 824.40s]  July's the open beta.
[824.40s -> 837.80s]  This game's awful.
[837.80s -> 847.45s]  Alright, now what?
[847.45s -> 848.45s]  Get rid of Pac-Man?
[848.45s -> 858.50s]  At least it shuts up the people.
[858.50s -> 887.81s]  Okay, at least we can get away from that fucking song.
[887.81s -> 919.54s]  Oh, here it is.
[919.54s -> 921.54s]  The one where you could jump was really actually good.
[921.54s -> 978.95s]  Oh!
[985.83s -> 1018.18s]  Here it comes.
[1018.18s -> 1049.86s]  I fucked this whole thing up so bad.
[1049.86s -> 1069.02s]  I tried to press up.
[1069.02s -> 1070.02s]  This game's fucking stupid.
[1070.02s -> 1075.48s]  Wait, what?
[1075.48s -> 1077.48s]  I didn't press it that many times!
[1077.48s -> 1096.45s]  Did you guys know that Pac-Man was originally gonna be a pizza game?
[1096.45s -> 1101.41s]  It was like you put like sauce and cheese on the pizza and stuff and you put it in the oven, but the game director
[1101.71s -> 1107.52s]  The putting the sauce on the pizza sound sounded so funny to the director of the game that
[1107.74s -> 1112.80s]  It's just like which probably maybe we should change it to like an eating thing or the pizza eats things
[1124.92s -> 1166.80s]  You lying come so easily to you. I'm not a liar. I'm a performer. Shut up. It's a performance. Shut up
[1166.80s -> 1185.74s]  I'm a performer. This dude is wicked soy. I'm fine. That was fun
[1186.38s -> 1194.68s]  Who he was gonna be called puck man. No, it's pizza man
[1202.50s -> 1209.68s]  Play pac-man two times. Okay, so I have to play this two times to unlock super pac-man. All right, I played it twice
[1214.09s -> 1233.04s]  All right, come kill me they found out in the US kids would edit the P on the machine to an F
[1233.64s -> 1252.04s]  Remember this sucks go back to Miku. I can't I'm too burnt out to do Miku. I can't do Miku
[1252.04s -> 1263.88s]  I can't play Miku anymore. I'm prime bars out from all the flashing colors Miku or riot. No, I can't right now
[1263.88s -> 1287.20s]  I'm just tired now. Look, I've got I unlocked um pac-man super pac-man. There we go. All right
[1287.20s -> 1289.08s]  What is super pac-man?
[1289.08s -> 1302.63s]  I've ever played this
[1302.91s -> 1304.51s]  Same one
[1304.51s -> 1309.64s]  This looks fucking weird. What the hell is this? I
[1319.57s -> 1331.36s]  Interesting don't you get all the keys pac-man would never eat eggs. They're too healthy. Wait, he eats fruits
[1331.80s -> 1346.04s]  Please my ears. It looks like it's turned on
[1355.90s -> 1363.34s]  What the fuck I got all the fruits it's all the keys
[1364.34s -> 1369.64s]  This is the kind of game that I would get
[1369.72s -> 1383.45s]  like my grandfather on his steam of his first steam account and I would go to check a year from now to see what my
[1383.45s -> 1387.58s]  grandfather had in his steam library, and it would be this and
[1389.36s -> 1394.40s]  I don't know dead space one and two because it's on sale for three dollars every year
[1394.48s -> 1410.44s]  It's the only games you have and all the free-to-play stuff and you'd go on it and see how much time that grandpa had
[1410.80s -> 1414.25s]  Playtime he hadn't even opened him
[1430.12s -> 1432.12s]  500 hours on path of exile
[1432.84s -> 1446.68s]  They go too fast. I I never was a fan of pac-man. I
[1448.96s -> 1450.92s]  Was I was never a fan of pac-man?
[1450.92s -> 1455.01s]  I was always I was more of a fan of pac-man's character than I was his video games
[1467.23s -> 1469.23s]  Pac-man super pac-man pac-mania
[1469.91s -> 1471.91s]  pac-man battle royale
[1472.79s -> 1474.79s]  pac-land pac-man
[1474.87s -> 1478.71s]  arrangement
[1478.71s -> 1479.91s]  Pac-pal
[1479.91s -> 1488.62s]  Okay, let me do pac-man battle royale say it and so I love pac-man
[1488.62s -> 1497.26s]  He's the greatest video game character ever but his I don't know these games were kind of the originals great
[1498.76s -> 1502.84s]  Pac-man's great adventure is great the one where you have to like point him in directions and help him
[1503.00s -> 1518.16s]  Why is that not here? This one's good, okay?
[1519.12s -> 1523.67s]  Eat power pellets
[1523.95s -> 1531.37s]  He's a cannibal
[1531.57s -> 1545.32s]  Fight how do I how do you win? Wait? You don't how do you hurt each other? I don't understand. What's going on?
[1545.84s -> 1550.07s]  Do I have to wait to eat each other? Ah
[1554.13s -> 1577.94s]  All right, that's all right. So I've won wait for next round. This is zoomer pac-man. No, it's not money in I guess
[1577.94s -> 1588.42s]  You play with like four people. That's fine. Does everyone have to have their own controller at the arcade cabinet. That would be fun
[1604.20s -> 1606.04s]  Kiss the CPU
[1606.04s -> 1623.09s]  Lost to CPU. How come there's only one CPU? That's weird. It's gonna be way more
[1623.73s -> 1650.50s]  That's how did I just lose that? You only have one CPU in your computer. You only have one CPU
[1652.68s -> 1657.00s]  All right. This this one sucks. This would be fun with like four actual friends sitting around
[1657.40s -> 1666.77s]  This is a scuffed version of championship edition
[1667.57s -> 1678.74s]  They have these at tape. They have these at I think they have these as table machines in some arcades
[1680.64s -> 1682.00s]  That makes sense
[1682.00s -> 1698.87s]  What's wrong? I'm not even paying attention. What just happened? Why is the sound getting faster?
[1700.64s -> 1702.64s]  This is a Dave and Buster's game
[1704.50s -> 1710.36s]  It really is
[1710.36s -> 1712.36s]  This is a game at Dave and Buster's
[1713.70s -> 1717.33s]  That's so funny
[1717.33s -> 1720.45s]  Yeah, and it spits out like 10 tickets
[1723.73s -> 1727.89s]  The shit you like. Oh great. Cool. That was fun. I guess I got like eight tickets
[1728.77s -> 1734.92s]  This literally is at Dave and Buster's
[1740.74s -> 1754.44s]  No, is it? No, it's not
[1754.52s -> 1757.56s]  It actually is deal or no deal is the best arcade game
[1758.44s -> 1762.39s]  Now we can maybe should I play dear or no deal on stream? I think it'd be fun
[1763.27s -> 1789.75s]  All right. Well that game was fun. It's fine. It's fine. My turn like pack land two times
[1789.99s -> 1796.00s]  I want to know what pack pal is right pack mania and pack land. Where's pack land?
[1799.65s -> 1803.41s]  Okay, so it's gonna open this and then close it because what is pack pal?
[1810.95s -> 1812.95s]  Oh it knows
[1813.03s -> 1823.16s]  I have to actually get in and die. This one was actually the best one
[1825.96s -> 1827.96s]  There's more games in the big machine
[1828.28s -> 1838.93s]  What was the pac-man game you played you made a video on like 10 years ago?
[1839.49s -> 1843.01s]  That's pac-man to the great adventure or something
[1844.24s -> 1846.24s]  It's not a pac-man game
[1846.48s -> 1849.44s]  It's a side scrolling directions game. It's really weird
[1850.40s -> 1856.16s]  I wonder if there's uh, if they might be in it
[1862.88s -> 1869.75s]  This one has a final boss it's not in this how why would this not is it a licensing problem?
[1871.56s -> 1875.59s]  I thought that was gonna be on here. That's why I want that's why I bought the game
[1876.23s -> 1879.11s]  I thought it was a pac-man museum plus. Okay, let's go
[1883.16s -> 1885.59s]  packing time
[1885.59s -> 1887.59s]  That's one of them that i'm thinking of right?
[1889.19s -> 1900.21s]  Okay, well what's pac-man arrangement, how do I not even know these games came out?
[1910.21s -> 1920.77s]  Instructions i've been i've been playing video games for
[1921.57s -> 1924.88s]  30 years
[1924.88s -> 1926.88s]  I feel like these were all made up today
[1927.88s -> 1929.96s]  And i'm being gaslit into thinking these are real
[1931.19s -> 1933.19s]  Well, i've never heard of these
[1958.34s -> 1962.63s]  Why is there a bunny?
[1962.63s -> 1964.63s]  This one's actually fun
[1964.63s -> 1980.32s]  I like this one. This one was good dash. Whoa. All right, that's cool
[1982.87s -> 2005.80s]  It's awesome just kind of fun to do that
[2016.26s -> 2017.94s]  Whoa, wait, you can do that
[2017.94s -> 2033.32s]  That's helpful pac-man arrangement that would have weird name. Is that why this game didn't do that? Well, because it's called pac-man
[2033.94s -> 2035.24s]  arrangement
[2035.24s -> 2038.82s]  I thought it was gonna be I thought I was gonna be making flowers or something
[2040.40s -> 2042.80s]  Painting game. I don't think it was gonna be an actual pac-man game
[2061.73s -> 2078.37s]  Get them all good go
[2080.95s -> 2082.85s]  Oh, i'm in trouble
[2082.85s -> 2084.85s]  Actually in trouble. Nope. I'm good
[2085.25s -> 2091.84s]  Why wouldn't it be a pac-man game?
[2092.10s -> 2095.30s]  Oh, they've made some weird ass pac-man games over the last 20 years
[2120.66s -> 2122.66s]  big fucking deal
[2122.82s -> 2158.31s]  I missed one little pellet really they make a weird noise. What's the they go?
[2158.63s -> 2170.21s]  Oh
[2170.53s -> 2178.77s]  You should have a pac-man themed wedding. I thought I would wait. I thought that was it. I thought this was a bonus stage
[2180.39s -> 2181.83s]  What the fuck?
[2181.83s -> 2216.40s]  Throwing for pac content. It is a bonus round. Okay. That was I don't know why I just got invincibility frames for a second
[2216.40s -> 2217.92s]  That was weird
[2217.92s -> 2242.45s]  Shit bad. What I swear this fucking goddamn controller. What the hell?
[2265.97s -> 2269.19s]  Oh, no
[2269.19s -> 2272.63s]  I'm pressing the buttons. What the fuck?
[2274.28s -> 2278.28s]  I'm pressing die. It's just he's fucking hits a wall freezes, bro
[2279.16s -> 2281.16s]  bro, relax
[2281.16s -> 2284.18s]  That was fun
[2284.18s -> 2289.84s]  I i'm literally pressing the button and just hits the wall and move this is what pac-man
[2290.82s -> 2296.73s]  Only works when you have the stick that has only the four directions
[2297.43s -> 2305.00s]  Anything else is impossible. You cannot play pac-man with a regular fucking controller. You have to have four one, two, three four
[2305.24s -> 2316.24s]  That's it return to arcade. Yes, please
[2316.56s -> 2321.97s]  Use the d-pad d-pad doesn't work either because sometimes you press up on a d-pad
[2322.21s -> 2327.52s]  It presses like left or right at the same time. I'm using an xbox one controller the d-pad
[2327.52s -> 2330.92s]  It's like all one gigantic button
[2333.40s -> 2342.02s]  You need a stick or arrow keys. Yeah, but i'm a fucking console gamer. Okay. Now what is it for this?
[2342.34s -> 2344.71s]  Play pac-lan two times
[2347.16s -> 2354.07s]  How about not play I already did play this once
[2357.78s -> 2361.54s]  Continue from pause date. Oh, I got sick. I got sick of it and didn't want to play anymore
[2364.05s -> 2367.09s]  Play deal or no deal. We'll do that on um on sunday
[2368.05s -> 2371.68s]  Here's your plan for sunday. We're gonna play we're gonna play um
[2372.48s -> 2374.72s]  trivia and and um game show games
[2375.76s -> 2377.76s]  How about who wants to be a millionaire?
[2378.80s -> 2381.33s]  deal or no deal
[2381.33s -> 2382.93s]  So maybe a couple others
[2382.93s -> 2391.43s]  We'll do that on sunday. I'm just trying to die
[2395.76s -> 2398.34s]  All right now back out come back in
[2401.06s -> 2408.68s]  I want to at least see each game once play the awful full-priced millionaire game that came out like a year ago
[2409.33s -> 2411.33s]  Yeah, it's probably when i'll play
[2421.59s -> 2423.59s]  Go buy more games
[2423.59s -> 2425.59s]  Hello, let me unlock these ones first
[2425.75s -> 2442.40s]  What about the oregon trail? I don't I think I have maybe once back during one of the dos nights. Maybe I think so
[2463.64s -> 2468.85s]  I just played it again. All right, let me be honest
[2469.57s -> 2474.95s]  I bought the fucking game. Do I have to really do you have to put all this shit under walls?
[2475.03s -> 2479.59s]  Like it's pac-man museum. Do I really have to do all this to play the pac-man games? I want to play
[2494.15s -> 2496.95s]  It's not a it's a museum. It's I don't I don't have to go look
[2497.59s -> 2499.83s]  At the mona lisa to unlock
[2500.39s -> 2505.75s]  The other fucking paintings in the museum if it's a museum just put it in the museum. Just put it in the museum
[2507.62s -> 2509.62s]  Just put it put it for display in the museum
[2516.64s -> 2520.00s]  Unlocking things is fun. You joyless husker human
[2531.06s -> 2558.74s]  Okay, can I please play the other game hacking pal eat the turn over the card and eat the flashing item give it back
[2558.98s -> 2565.41s]  I'm good. She's safe touch a ghost and you'll lose turn the tables with a special item press the button
[2568.88s -> 2571.12s]  That kind of hurts my head to look at
[2581.38s -> 2626.82s]  Eat the s we did it
[2629.36s -> 2648.21s]  One with the hat was better. I get the idea. The concept is interesting, right? But I
[2649.25s -> 2653.03s]  It's just modded pac-man
[2661.65s -> 2665.40s]  It's pretty awful
[2665.40s -> 2675.25s]  I'd say it's very awful. It's a less fun pac-man
[2676.29s -> 2678.29s]  Okay, so what are there any others I can do?
[2679.09s -> 2682.53s]  This one play pack in time two times. Where's pack in time?
[2683.57s -> 2689.20s]  Do I have to buy it?
[2690.90s -> 2706.48s]  What do I get it how do I get um pack in time
[2708.92s -> 2711.48s]  It's the big one
[2712.28s -> 2720.05s]  I can't play it pause saving is not supported. Oh, what the fuck
[2722.05s -> 2742.64s]  Our hero pac-man is the cool video game dude, we know and love okay
[2743.60s -> 2748.90s]  When the evil ghost witch and her ghost monsters invaded his world pac-man was there to defend it
[2749.54s -> 2757.28s]  Since then he's been living happily with his family in pac-land
[2758.00s -> 2769.30s]  But his fiendish arch enemy the ghost witch has vowed to disrupt his tranquil life
[2770.02s -> 2785.36s]  Okay, following the failure of her diabolical plan. She decided to eliminate pac-man once and for all the ghost which cast a
[2787.43s -> 2792.60s]  Forbidden spell on pac-man ripping him from his family. Oh my god
[2794.05s -> 2796.85s]  And hurling him through time to his dangerous past
[2797.49s -> 2807.00s]  The journey back in time transformed pac-man into a young pack boy
[2807.72s -> 2817.03s]  And the only change is he doesn't have a nose anymore the ghost witch sent him to a world which has never heard of the hero pac-man
[2817.75s -> 2825.75s]  though the witch's foul magic
[2825.83s -> 2837.86s]  The inhabitants of a once beautiful land have turned against him and the ghost witch's loyal ghost will do everything possible to keep him prisoner
[2840.07s -> 2841.83s]  Look at how cute he is
[2841.83s -> 2843.83s]  I love this version of pac-man
[2844.07s -> 2849.83s]  He's so cute let's find out
[2854.80s -> 2859.19s]  Okay
[2859.19s -> 2860.63s]  mountain
[2860.63s -> 2878.44s]  Huh? You have a it's like mega man
[2878.92s -> 2894.45s]  Are they trying to make okay the shoes the fast running they just try to make a sonic the hedgehog version
[2894.85s -> 2912.12s]  What does that do?
[2921.28s -> 2927.41s]  He's so stumpy how do I open this
[2928.29s -> 2936.47s]  How do I open the chest?
[2936.55s -> 2940.31s]  He looks like one of those custom south park characters that everybody used to have
[2941.19s -> 2943.27s]  Do you remember that?
[2943.27s -> 2957.03s]  Can I can I swim?
[2957.03s -> 2964.80s]  I need a key
[2964.80s -> 2965.76s]  Ah
[2965.76s -> 2973.16s]  I can't swim
[2973.16s -> 2988.34s]  Bro, I don't see somebody playing mega man that knows what they're doing and they're really good at the game
[2988.82s -> 2999.68s]  Some of the speed runners, right? It's always like they just like brr brr brr when they jump. It's crazy
[3000.64s -> 3002.24s]  How do I get through here?
[3002.24s -> 3012.92s]  Can I swim? I can't swim down
[3013.56s -> 3018.28s]  Use the item
[3018.28s -> 3029.09s]  What item?
[3029.09s -> 3071.35s]  A change. Oh left bumper. Somebody just said this sucks. How do I get down here? How do I break this?
[3080.10s -> 3083.40s]  Can I drop down? I need a hammer press a
[3084.04s -> 3148.69s]  Is there another item? These controls are gonna slow down slow down get the water hammer. Where is it?
[3149.25s -> 3156.55s]  This is worse than glover. No, it's not
[3160.58s -> 3200.24s]  Where's this hammer? It's in the water of what get me out of here. How do I get in the fucking exit?
[3200.72s -> 3232.02s]  I need all the rings all the dots. I can't even get back up here guys. I'm fucking screwed
[3235.96s -> 3237.96s]  I can't beat the level anymore
[3244.37s -> 3248.53s]  Where's the rope?
[3248.53s -> 3250.53s]  Why did the rope get taken from me?
[3250.69s -> 3256.13s]  somebody said
[3256.13s -> 3258.13s]  Reviewer gameplay. Oh, please
[3261.89s -> 3264.45s]  You don't know how hard this is to control. It's so weird
[3278.24s -> 3283.54s]  Ow
[3283.54s -> 3287.19s]  It's really weird kid. I think they're up here
[3293.76s -> 3306.44s]  He's so bouncy. It's weird. It's it's strange. Trust me. I'm so impatient. I fucking can't do it
[3340.16s -> 3354.50s]  That's fine. I don't want to do that anymore
[3355.38s -> 3357.38s]  That was a really cute one, but I don't want to do that
[3362.52s -> 3364.52s]  Pack and roll remix
[3364.52s -> 3425.04s]  Is this a game cube or something?
[3444.66s -> 3446.02s]  Is he yelling?
[3446.02s -> 3454.50s]  This is another Dave and Buster's game. I don't I disagree
[3487.62s -> 3498.55s]  check checkpoint
[3499.03s -> 3522.84s]  Get up there
[3522.84s -> 3524.68s]  Get up there
[3524.68s -> 3526.68s]  It's driving me fucking crazy
[3526.92s -> 3552.08s]  It's just you like you can't control it. It's it just be so bouncy
[3552.56s -> 3570.39s]  He's so bouncy in these games. It's ridiculous, but I have to play this again. He goes too fast and he's too bouncy
[3571.11s -> 3573.48s]  I feel like my mouse sensitivity is too high
[3574.28s -> 3609.94s]  I games like these just drive me fucking crazy
[3610.58s -> 3616.40s]  I remember when I was a little kid snake rattle and roll. I I tried to break the nintendo controller in half
[3618.07s -> 3620.71s]  Like bending it this way because I couldn't I hated it so much
[3625.92s -> 3629.68s]  And all it did was just made really loud crackling sounds
[3630.40s -> 3632.88s]  like I was not strong enough to break it obviously, so it was just like
[3635.60s -> 3637.76s]  All you heard was just crunching stuff
[3644.45s -> 3647.57s]  Not strong enough to break it but strong enough to like kind of fuck it up
[3648.21s -> 3663.67s]  Just get me out of here. I don't want to play this snake rattle and roll is good. You just bad
[3664.15s -> 3666.15s]  No, I I didn't say that
[3666.47s -> 3672.36s]  pac-man 256
[3672.36s -> 3678.56s]  What is this?
[3678.56s -> 3681.12s]  Fuck is a mobile game

[3801.36s -> 3837.27s]  What the fuck? All right, one more one more and that's it. Why this is the best one so far
[3846.64s -> 3848.72s]  I need to get a thousand. I want to get over a thousand again

[4080.09s -> 4096.78s]  What are you doing? Do something? What the fuck? All right, what the hell was that? It's you gotta get the fruits
[4096.78s -> 4107.40s]  All right, let me see if I can get 10k. All right times two the coins don't matter that much

[5123.93s -> 5136.14s]  That's actually the best one so far orange always goes down
[5137.78s -> 5146.87s]  I feel like I should have gotten some points for that
