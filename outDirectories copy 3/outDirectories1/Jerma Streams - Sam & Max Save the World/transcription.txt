[1.46s -> 14.41s]  Hello there. How you doing? Doing good. Me too. I'm doing good too. Hey, still in school?
[15.67s -> 33.98s]  Good. Still at that job? Good. Still hanging out with uh, good. Cool. Still, still eating salmon?
[33.98s -> 50.65s]  Good. Good. No, no. 3am stream. There's a late one, but there's a reason for that. I told you guys I
[50.65s -> 59.22s]  was gonna go four days in a row because I got a lot of stuff planned. I'm taking a vacation
[60.73s -> 65.69s]  and I'm not talking about, oh I'll be gone for three days. I'm taking a real, I ain't gonna be
[65.69s -> 73.51s]  around for like a week. I'm gonna be done disconnecting from the internet for a little while.
[74.68s -> 86.28s]  My mother is coming up and I'm gonna spend time with my mom. It's been a long time since I've seen
[86.28s -> 91.59s]  her. We have a lot of activities planned. We're gonna just do, we're gonna do some mother-son things
[92.92s -> 98.68s]  and there's also some other family that are coming up as well. So I'm gonna be tied up for a while.
[102.26s -> 111.96s]  I will return. You'll see me again. Probably on, we'll probably go, depending what we do today.
[111.96s -> 121.53s]  This stream was just kind of a hangout sesh, you know. Yesterday we played Gunslinger. It was great.
[121.53s -> 127.94s]  Had a lot of fun. Today there's not a whole lot of plans. I just knew that I was not going to be live
[127.94s -> 137.59s]  for at least five days. So kind of wanted just to hang out a little bit longer. So what we've decided
[137.59s -> 147.86s]  to do is we're gonna play Salmon Max. It's been one of the most requested games for me to stream
[147.86s -> 156.78s]  on this channel. There's been one guy in particular. More like two one guys. I've been really,
[156.78s -> 162.97s]  really looking forward to it. This Doki Doki. Now what I already told you I wasn't gonna play Doki
[162.97s -> 173.94s]  Doki. But no, this is gonna, we're just gonna hang out, play a little Salmon Max, relax. After
[173.94s -> 178.74s]  we do this, we might do an episode. Depending on if people want to keep seeing it. Maybe we'll do
[178.74s -> 187.32s]  another episode. I want to watch a couple videos. I want to, there's a few things, there's another
[187.32s -> 194.46s]  game on Steam that I was looking at. It looked cool. This is just a who, this, there are no cares
[194.46s -> 205.91s]  in the world on this stream today. I don't have a plan. We're just going. But let me make a tweet
[205.91s -> 330.94s]  about it because I am live. So see you guys in a minute. Hey, so why don't we switch over to it?
[330.94s -> 339.62s]  It's currently right here and hopefully it captures right and did it. Oh god, I don't think it did.
[339.62s -> 346.76s]  Yeah it did. So I don't know very much about this game besides that it's a point and click game and we're
[346.76s -> 356.82s]  in a point and click mode. This is not Doki Doki Literature Club. This is Salmon Max on the road
[356.82s -> 374.12s]  again. A classic I've never played. You ready? Actually playing, I'm new game. This might be a
[374.12s -> 378.12s]  little loud. We can adjust the volume, but just be prepared. You might get a little bit of like a
[378.84s -> 391.80s]  blast. An audio blast. What? Already 10 out of 10. Anytime a saxophone presents itself in video
[391.88s -> 393.64s]  game. It's already a fucking eight or nine at least.
[438.89s -> 443.13s]  When are we going to get another case, Sam? Surely the local lawbreakers must miss our esoteric
[443.13s -> 448.17s]  brand of personalized criminal justice. Patience is a sharp razor to swallow, little buddy.
[448.17s -> 458.47s]  Okay, don't scream this time. I got it. I got it. Hello? What? Leave Swiss cheese by the rat hole or
[458.47s -> 463.83s]  you'll never see your precious phone alive again. Jiminy Christmas even a padlock sweat box.
[463.83s -> 469.51s]  Some misguidedly ballsy felons napped our phone. Eerie. I just went cheese shopping. How did they
[469.51s -> 477.11s]  know? Be sure it's Swiss cheese, right? And be quick about it. We got some rats already. Ordinarily I
[477.11s -> 481.75s]  hate yielding to extortion, but I have to admit I'm half charmed by the sheer spunk of that oily
[481.75s -> 486.63s]  little perp. Where'd you put the cheese, Max? Gosh, it was hours ago. You know I have the memory of a
[486.63s -> 495.29s]  dried trout. Sadly, yes I do. Well, it's got to be somewhere in this room. Okay, so this is the two
[495.29s -> 499.93s]  characters. This is Sam and this is Max. I only know that because not only is it telling me this,
[500.49s -> 504.17s]  I remember the thing from Team Fortress. Max's head. They're worth a lot of money.
[505.53s -> 509.29s]  So we're gonna get cheese. This is a point and click adventure game. You get your cardboard
[509.29s -> 516.55s]  box inventory. Let's turn it down a little. I already tried. You crack me up a little. You crack
[516.55s -> 525.24s]  me. You crack me up, little buddy. What's that? You crack me up. You crack me up, little buddy.
[525.24s -> 530.76s]  That's probably all right. You crack me up, little buddy. Voices out. You crack me up, little buddy.
[531.96s -> 541.53s]  Wait, he's talking about me. Louder. Louder. Louder. Put it on low graphics. Why would I do that? I
[541.53s -> 549.56s]  wanted to see the cool stuff. All right, Swiss cheese. Where'd you put the cheese? What about the
[549.56s -> 555.32s]  wastebasket? No dice. No cheese, but about in the water cooler. Hello, Mr. Spatula. How's the
[555.32s -> 565.08s]  weather in there? I'm vibing so, so hard with Sam here. All right, we're looking for cheese.
[565.88s -> 575.96s]  Can I talk to Max? Hey, Max. When is it, Sam? Where's the cheese? You sure you don't remember
[575.96s -> 580.52s]  where you put that cheese, little buddy? Sheesh. You'd think I'd forgotten my pants or something.
[580.52s -> 585.72s]  It's here in the office someplace. Pants? He's looking for his pants. Let's get to work. I
[585.72s -> 592.92s]  couldn't agree more. Okay, look at her pants. Where are they? This might come in handy. Don't
[592.92s -> 598.36s]  do that again. All right, we got a boxing glove. Can I see it? I got a gun and a boxing glove,
[598.36s -> 604.23s]  but that's not cheese. All right, dartboard and a little of this. One of these days we're going to
[604.23s -> 608.63s]  finish that game. I'm still working on getting the rest of the darts from the police impound.
[611.59s -> 618.07s]  Donut box. Cheese donut. Donuts. Don't throw that out. I'm saving it for a science experiment.
[618.07s -> 627.38s]  You bet, little buddy. Okay, I didn't mean to do that, but you can do that, I guess. No comment.
[629.50s -> 634.70s]  You can just beat up your friend. 20 years worth of electric bills take up a surprising amount of
[634.70s -> 641.82s]  space. 20 years with electric bills? They would turn this off. Good old Lou. Who's Lou again?
[641.82s -> 651.56s]  The bowling ball, of course. Can I ask them? Maybe they know where it is.
[651.56s -> 660.04s]  Yoo-hoo, tiny hoodlums. Leave the cheese by the hole. Okay, what about the desk?
[661.26s -> 666.46s]  VCR, television, lava lamp. Someone once told me that the contents of a lava lamp make an
[666.46s -> 674.84s]  excellent hand cream. That was me. Which is why I haven't tried it. This thing is regular Nintendo.
[675.80s -> 680.92s]  I bought that VCR at the supermarket. So you know it's a good one. Still smells like asparagus,
[681.40s -> 688.30s]  though. Oh, open, what a lush vegetation. I think Hubert could use some water, Max.
[688.30s -> 697.46s]  I'm training him to fetch it himself. Out the window. Cheese? It looks like cheese right there.
[698.10s -> 705.85s]  Do cheese balls look like cheese curds, right? Look at curds, cheese curds. They say graffiti
[705.85s -> 725.61s]  is the poetry of our time. Just what we need. More lame poetry. Cheese. Look at the cheese. In the
[725.61s -> 733.53s]  closet? There's a lot of cheese. That's too much cheese. I thought that was gonna be like a piece of
[733.53s -> 765.16s]  cheese. Why? Oh, okay. Well, that was, that's not it. That's a gag. Okay. Swiss cheese. I want Swiss
[765.16s -> 772.23s]  cheese. Well, can we go to the supermarket? 2002 was a great year for calendars. This is old.
[772.23s -> 775.75s]  I'm glad we stocked up. We've been going through them at a rate of about one a year since then.
[780.89s -> 787.45s]  Pizza? Is it, there's no Swiss cheese on pizza, right? What do I have for item? Bowling ball,
[787.45s -> 794.54s]  boxing glove, big gun. Okay, he takes it out. Oh, you wait. I can, you, I can aim the gun?
[794.54s -> 803.43s]  Tempting sometimes, but I become fond of the little guy. Whoa. How many bullets are in here?
[808.84s -> 818.84s]  All right, you have infinite ammo. What about the boxing glove? I'd rather punch other things.
[824.66s -> 830.89s]  Just like cover the hole. Apart from the holes, I don't think it looks much like Swiss cheese.
[846.76s -> 851.56s]  Take that, you law-breaking dairy products. Got it. Sam, no, the cheese was innocent.
[851.56s -> 858.20s]  Yeah, it's a cartoon. I think not. Yep. You got to think of like a cartoon. Or close enough
[858.20s -> 869.34s]  to fool the casual observer anyway. Don't say voila. You've read chat. You've read chat. I
[869.34s -> 876.76s]  didn't fucking do that. Yoo-hoo. Tiny hoodlums. Leave the cheese by the hole. What the fuck is
[876.76s -> 885.58s]  that? I didn't fucking do that. Greetings. The members of the benevolent brotherhood of vermin
[885.58s -> 890.22s]  would like to thank you for your offering. The members of Sam and Max would like their phone
[890.22s -> 897.26s]  back now. If you don't mind, I regret to inform you the situation has changed and I am unable
[897.26s -> 903.18s]  to comply with your request. A list of additional demands for the return of the button is as
[903.18s -> 912.60s]  followed. Now, let's discuss this calmly. Let's debone the smarmy little skis and see if the
[912.60s -> 918.92s]  phone's in there. I ain't talking coppers. Jimmy toothy ain't no rat. Uh, well, I ain't talking.
[920.68s -> 926.12s]  So wait, I can decide? How about I'll feed you broken glass? I'm thinking about stuffing a
[926.12s -> 930.92s]  light bulb down your throat, perp. Go ahead. I've been a little hungry. Hey, dog face,
[930.92s -> 938.90s]  your partner's giving me a headache. I'm about ready to wring your scrawny trash eating now.
[938.90s -> 945.30s]  No, we're going to do good cop, bad cop. Good cop, bad cop. You can't just go full bad cop.
[946.26s -> 950.98s]  I'm going to strangle you. I'm going to feed you glass. No, we have to like bring you a cake or
[950.98s -> 957.29s]  something, right? You mentioned a headache. Would you like some aspirin? Oh, and while I'm at it,
[957.29s -> 960.89s]  is there anything else I can do to make you comfortable? Are you thirsty perhaps?
[960.97s -> 965.85s]  Lights too bright? Well, that's sporting of you. Now you mention it. I really don't like being up
[965.85s -> 970.81s]  here so hot. I got me a thing about heights. They make me nervous, you know? Oh, really?
[972.17s -> 977.05s]  I can adjust the lights. Would you like some, a smoothie? I can make that for you too. I like
[977.05s -> 984.62s]  that. Almost dropped my whole coffee. Uh, how about, okay, let's, let's let them up. All right. Let's
[984.62s -> 991.18s]  help me help you. Help me help you, Jimmy. What the heck is that supposed to mean? I have no idea,
[991.18s -> 998.87s]  but it always sounds good on TV. Hand over the phone or I'll make you lick my German crusted
[998.87s -> 1004.95s]  palms. Yeah. Yeah. I've licked the worst. Like what? You don't even want to know. Not telling.
[1006.76s -> 1013.86s]  Okay. Uh, he wants to get, how do we put them down? We'll go half easy on you. If you'll just cough
[1013.86s -> 1024.12s]  up the phone. Yeah. Yeah. Never happened pig. We've met your demands. We got you the cheese.
[1024.12s -> 1027.88s]  Any honorable rodent would hold up his end of the bargain and give back our phone.
[1027.88s -> 1031.72s]  Us rodents is not known for being particularly honorable. I was going to put them down. I want
[1031.72s -> 1037.53s]  to put them down on the ground. Don't like hide, say? How'd you like it if I dangled your greasy
[1037.53s -> 1044.41s]  hide out the window? Hey, you wouldn't wait. I warned you. I'm known for my fuzzy white butter
[1044.41s -> 1050.09s]  fingers. It's true. You should see him trying to tie an ass guy. All right. All right. Have mercy.
[1050.09s -> 1054.57s]  I've had mercy. It was unpleasantly gooey. Like, well, like things that have fallen onto pavement
[1054.57s -> 1063.11s]  from a great height. I give up. Take your phone and let me go. I wish I could.
[1065.51s -> 1072.47s]  Hello. Yes. Great gouts of steaming magma on a beeline for the orphanage. We're on our way.
[1080.74s -> 1084.50s]  It was a commissioner, Max. Multiple reports. He killed that guy in the neighborhood.
[1084.50s -> 1089.22s]  You dropped that guy on the window and murdered him. Idiot. We've got to get down to the corner
[1089.30s -> 1100.18s]  store right away. Okay. Get down to the corner store. Life troubling your digestion.
[1100.98s -> 1106.50s]  Reality blocking your passages. Expel your troubles with emetics. The handbook for
[1106.50s -> 1113.14s]  multicolored happiness and separate your bliss. Hey, that's that personal color spectrum book.
[1113.14s -> 1123.77s]  Self-help for the helplessly selfish. Perfect. I'll take two. Okay. Yeah, this is cool so far.
[1123.77s -> 1127.21s]  When I got this thing, I thought it would be useful. Where else would we keep the
[1127.21s -> 1131.85s]  pieces of paper that we're never going to look at again? All right. Let's make sure I saved it
[1131.85s -> 1136.65s]  because we'll pick it up another day. Maybe like I'm thinking about maybe like a few weeks or
[1136.65s -> 1152.66s]  something. I'll see you guys later. That's it. 20 minutes. Can I just, if I stream for like 15
[1152.66s -> 1167.18s]  minutes a day, 20 minutes a day, 20 minutes a week, you would never get anything done.
[1168.76s -> 1173.37s]  It would be unbearable. You wouldn't be able to do anything if you stream for like
[1173.37s -> 1186.78s]  fucking 20 minutes a week. Money. Wait, wasn't there something over here? Remember I looked
[1186.78s -> 1199.96s]  out the window and there was something on the ground? I told you. Oh, it's just trash. I don't
[1199.96s -> 1204.44s]  think I can do anything about that. We've got to go to the corner store. I don't, I mean really
[1204.44s -> 1212.26s]  don't mean to keep hitting you like that, but what's this? Oh, you ran into it. Well, look
[1212.26s -> 1217.06s]  where you're going. Dumpster. I once ate in that dumpster. Fresh food in there. Rampaging gorilla.
[1217.06s -> 1220.42s]  I still don't know how she got out of the office. I was sure it locked the door.
[1225.91s -> 1229.43s]  That was like what the YouTube used to be like. Yeah, but the thing about the YouTube videos is
[1229.43s -> 1234.23s]  was, okay, so like for instance, if I played Sekiro for like three or four streams and I condensed it
[1234.23s -> 1243.58s]  down to like one or two videos, that's like how it worked. What's this guy doing? Say there,
[1243.58s -> 1249.90s]  unfashionably dressed street urchin. Oh, you made me mess up. Now I have to start all over.
[1249.90s -> 1256.30s]  Yeah, I had to edit. You are one ugly kid. Hey, I know you. Oh, that's right. You're one of the
[1256.30s -> 1262.94s]  lovable scamps from that old TV show about the singing soda jerks. It's called the soda poppers.
[1262.94s -> 1269.90s]  In the 70s are not old. Specs, it's you. Wow, an actual celebrity vandalizing our neighborhood.
[1269.90s -> 1277.02s]  This is great. Remember when you were famous? Remember when you were famous? You're under arrest.
[1277.98s -> 1284.68s]  I don't look. I don't care who you are. I don't care what you're doing, where you've been.
[1285.56s -> 1290.36s]  You are committing a crime. You're under arrest. By the way, we're freelance police
[1290.36s -> 1294.84s]  and you're under arrest. No, I've really got to finish this. But thanks anyway.
[1296.76s -> 1303.10s]  That's not how it works. You're under arrest because you're doing that. That's why you're
[1303.10s -> 1308.86s]  under arrest. Seriously, you're under arrest. Come along quietly and no one gets hurt.
[1308.94s -> 1319.88s]  Actually, I prefer that you don't come quietly. Must finish painting. All right. Well, I guess
[1319.88s -> 1324.84s]  you're not under arrest. Boy, you sure were a famous, oddly underdeveloped teen celebrity
[1324.84s -> 1331.72s]  at one time. I'm still famous. Are you? Um, like a million point one times more famous than you.
[1332.36s -> 1336.60s]  Well, more famous than me? More known in the 18 to 34 year old repeat criminal demographic.
[1337.96s -> 1344.39s]  I like that. That was a pretty good joke. Say, how about an autograph for my pal?
[1344.71s -> 1350.87s]  You can sign my butt. Make it out to squinky. I don't sign butts anymore. People get ticklish
[1350.87s -> 1356.47s]  and they move and it gets all messed up. I'll risk it. Sorry. I can't stop painting.
[1359.80s -> 1366.52s]  18 to 34 repeat criminal demographic is my demographic. But you guys saying you're all
[1366.52s -> 1375.21s]  repeat criminals. So specs, what are you up to these days? Any new projects? Yes. I have a new
[1375.29s -> 1381.85s]  life in my life and his name is Brady cultures. He's the genius behind the Ibo ocular fitness
[1381.85s -> 1387.93s]  program. You really should try one of his videos. Where can I get a video? Where can I find a copy
[1387.93s -> 1397.83s]  of the video? They carry them over at Bosco's. You should get it. Okay. Ibo sounds like an electronic
[1397.83s -> 1406.07s]  archery toy. Ibo is the truly visionary. Try the video today. Sure thing. We'll try. I love that
[1406.07s -> 1414.07s]  voice. I'm gonna get, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get that down. Sounds fascinating. What about enough
[1414.07s -> 1422.68s]  about that? You can never get enough of Brady culture's Ibo. Do I need money? All right,
[1422.68s -> 1429.38s]  we'll see. Well, that's nice. Now you're under arrest. Wait, what is it? What are you telling
[1429.38s -> 1436.58s]  me something about that trendy modern street art you're perpetrating? What about? What is it? How
[1436.58s -> 1442.82s]  did you select your subject matter? He looks like a fried egg. It's Brady culture. He's the genius
[1442.82s -> 1448.66s]  behind the Ibo ocular fitness program. What are you, why are you trying one of his videos?
[1448.66s -> 1457.11s]  I'd rather try a fried egg. That's a good idea, Max. Sounds fascinating. That's a really good idea.
[1457.11s -> 1462.31s]  You can never get enough. All right, see you later. Well, we'll leave you to it. But you have to agree
[1462.31s -> 1469.03s]  to paint me next. Sorry, I only paint Brady culture. Max, you've got the TV schedule memorized.
[1469.03s -> 1473.67s]  Weren't the soda poppers going to be featured on one of those grim celebrity tell-alls today?
[1473.67s -> 1479.67s]  Oh yeah, on channel 173, the child star expose network, which we only get when it's convenient.
[1481.93s -> 1488.33s]  Brady culture. Bosco's inconvenience. What about the paper box? It says they've bred a horse with
[1488.33s -> 1493.13s]  eight legs. Does it run twice as fast? No, but it does eat twice as much.
[1495.61s -> 1500.89s]  That's good. It says cloning rights activists are cloning themselves to create a bigger voting block.
[1500.89s -> 1509.16s]  It works for locusts. That's pretty good. Looks like he's got Boston baked beans in there. Oh watch
[1509.16s -> 1530.17s]  baby, watch it. They don't. Guns, beer, meat and candy. The four food groups. Have no fear,
[1530.17s -> 1535.13s]  simple citizens. The freelance police are here. So we're not actual police. Is that what I'm
[1535.13s -> 1543.93s]  getting? It's just YouTube. Where's the SWAT team? Where's the national guard? Where's NASA? NASA?
[1543.93s -> 1550.89s]  Hold on Bosco. What's the problem? NASA? It's a terrorist, a munchkin terrorist. He'll be the
[1550.89s -> 1559.48s]  death of us all. What munchkin terrorist? Where is this Lilliputian agitator? Are you blind? He's
[1559.48s -> 1564.12s]  right there. Hey it's another one of the soda poppers. Isn't he the one with the
[1564.12s -> 1570.68s]  ladder control issues? Yeah, Whizzer. He's a former child star. Oh just lock him up.
[1573.16s -> 1578.60s]  Remain calm. What's he doing? I think we got it. What's he doing? Exactly what is the nature of
[1578.60s -> 1585.16s]  Whizzer's malfeasance? He's delivering videos I didn't even order. Brady coaches Ibo. What is that?
[1585.16s -> 1591.24s]  Oh it's something bad I can tell you that. Videos. And look at that display. It's subversive and
[1591.24s -> 1598.60s]  hideous. I don't know any white guy would have throw like that. I hear that. Remain calm. Video
[1598.60s -> 1605.42s]  dumping. Any other complaints? Have you seen this Ibo video? What's on the video? Have you actually
[1605.42s -> 1612.14s]  witnessed this Ibo video with your own eyes? Only a fool would watch a strange video. You watch it.
[1613.10s -> 1621.16s]  Anything else? Any other heinous terrorist activities to report? Yes he keeps using my bathroom.
[1621.16s -> 1626.92s]  Who knows what he's doing in there? I think I know. So we've got an unwanted video dumper and
[1626.92s -> 1635.40s]  serial leak taker. Not even the national guard can help us now. Okay so that's it. So all this
[1635.40s -> 1642.20s]  Whizzer character's doing is delivering videos and abusing his bathroom. That's it. Did he steal any
[1642.20s -> 1646.68s]  of your overpriced merchandise or at least try to disembowel you with a sharpened spork?
[1646.68s -> 1653.48s]  No way I've got BTAD. The single most technologically advanced security system ever conceived by the
[1653.48s -> 1659.96s]  human mind. All right what is what what is hold on what is BTADs? Why do these all look weird? Ibo.
[1659.96s -> 1666.52s]  BTAD. BTADs? Is that one of those acronym things I've been hearing so much about? Yep. Bosco Tech
[1666.60s -> 1672.76s]  automated defense system. I made it myself. Wow I always wanted to automate my defense.
[1672.76s -> 1678.36s]  How does it work? Just pull a weapon you'll see or try and walk out of here with something.
[1678.36s -> 1688.86s]  Go ahead I dare you. Maybe we will. All right is that enough of you? I think we got it. Okay
[1688.86s -> 1697.05s]  anything else? Is that enough out of you? We'll chat more later Bosco but right now it's time to
[1697.05s -> 1701.69s]  get up close and personal. We need to now find out what the fuck is going on.
[1704.55s -> 1709.11s]  Did he just steal something? What is why are you so fast?
[1711.80s -> 1714.76s]  All right hold on hold on. Free videos? Don't mind if I do.
[1715.56s -> 1722.52s]  Brady cultures Ibo for ocular fitness. The revolutionary isometric exercise. What's so
[1722.52s -> 1728.12s]  revolutionary about it? See through walls and clothing. Grow your eyes at lightning speed.
[1728.12s -> 1733.88s]  Lose five pounds of eyeball fat. Oh good I can never seem to lose that last five pounds.
[1733.88s -> 1737.72s]  What do you say we start off this movie night a little early today? So let's get one of these
[1737.72s -> 1745.06s]  and watch it. All right Ibo video. Do I have to buy one or do I have to can I steal it?
[1745.06s -> 1750.74s]  Why would I steal one? I can get it from you. My coffee machine. I think it's the tinge of green
[1750.74s -> 1761.06s]  that makes this coffee especially appealing. I take my coffee green like my men. Don't need a
[1761.06s -> 1767.06s]  sludgy. With 100 all-natural sludge. This week's flavors wheatgrass and meatloaf.
[1767.86s -> 1774.15s]  Wheatgrass and meatloaf smoothies. All right I'll tell you one of those doesn't sound too bad.
[1774.15s -> 1780.15s]  I'm not going to tell you which one. It could be either one of them. Max I've got a great idea
[1780.15s -> 1785.99s]  involving you, our microwave, and six feet of aluminum foil. Go on maybe another time.
[1787.98s -> 1791.98s]  Am I implying that I'm going to put that rabbit in the microwave and turn it on?
[1793.37s -> 1801.45s]  Not chose. They're mine not chose. Oh yuck yuck. That was a yuck joke. I need to hear it again.
[1801.45s -> 1809.61s]  Not chose. They're mine not chose. Not chose. They're mine not chose. Oh yuck. Ketchup, mustard,
[1809.61s -> 1818.81s]  and purple stuff. As vaguely referred to on TV. Purple stuff. Purple ketchup. Bring it back. I
[1818.81s -> 1826.41s]  remember it was cool. Your brain made it taste like um it tasted like blueberries. Your brain
[1826.41s -> 1830.89s]  made you taste it. It was like blueberry ketchup even though there was no blueberry in it. Your
[1830.89s -> 1837.13s]  brain just made it taste that way. Hey there Mr. Wizard. No need to be formal. My friends just call
[1837.13s -> 1843.69s]  me wizard and so do my enemies and lots of people like you I've never met. Everyone calls me wizard.
[1843.69s -> 1847.69s]  It was the chemicals. Yeah I know. I'm not saying it wasn't.
[1850.57s -> 1856.33s]  Everybody loves your show. My cousin's wife's dentist loved your show. Oh yeah we've always
[1856.33s -> 1862.41s]  been a big hit with the dentists. Gee I wonder why. Hey kids guzzle soda like the soda poppers
[1862.41s -> 1867.69s]  and you'll need so much expensive dental work you can kiss college goodbye. So these are soda poppers.
[1867.69s -> 1874.23s]  Cynicism is like a breath of fresh air on a crowded subway. Are you anything like your
[1874.23s -> 1885.51s]  character? So are they like the this is like Snow White and the seven soda poppers? Any chance
[1885.51s -> 1890.23s]  we could get you to sing the song from your old show? Yeah the theme song. What was it called?
[1890.23s -> 1898.81s]  It was called more than jerks but I can't sing it. I'm too embarrassed. Let's do it. Come on sing
[1898.81s -> 1908.07s]  the soda popper theme song. No. Do the voice. Do the do the character. Do it. How about an autograph
[1908.15s -> 1915.03s]  for my pal Max? You could write to Max. Thanks for saving my life that time in San Remo. Gee I don't
[1915.03s -> 1921.35s]  really have time. I've got a lot more videos to deliver. No time? Don't they give you bathroom
[1921.35s -> 1926.95s]  breaks? Sure but I don't sign autographs in there anymore. There was an incident.
[1928.31s -> 1935.08s]  Huh are you anything like the character you played on the tv show? Yeah like do you really have to
[1935.08s -> 1938.60s]  hit the john every five minutes? Remember the Simpsons character? Sometimes every three minutes.
[1938.60s -> 1946.90s]  It's like having a superpower. P every three minutes. This really is me. Well that's nice.
[1946.90s -> 1955.13s]  What is? What exactly are you doing here? Delivering videos. Take one. They're free.
[1955.13s -> 1963.90s]  Here we go. What's the story with these videos? Brady Culture's eyeball is the ocular fitness
[1963.90s -> 1967.90s]  regimen for people on the go. It's gonna be like a hypnotizing program where you get like all
[1967.90s -> 1975.69s]  fucked up and it makes you paint. I was gonna say giraffes but it's graffiti. That's the word.
[1975.69s -> 1982.95s]  There's a lot of g's and a lot of f's in both those words. What can you tell me about eyeball?
[1982.95s -> 1989.43s]  Eyeball is a revolutionary new program of isometric exercises to promote ocular fitness.
[1989.43s -> 1996.31s]  You can learn to move even see through walls and clothing. What if I don't wear clothing?
[1996.39s -> 2005.80s]  You gotta watch this tape. It changed my life. All right. Who exactly is this Brady Culture fellow
[2005.80s -> 2011.40s]  supposed to be? And what kind of steroids does he use on his hair? Brady Culture is a genius
[2011.40s -> 2015.96s]  and his eyeball program is a boon to all mankind. Settle down Jeremy. You got the fucking you got
[2015.96s -> 2023.32s]  the intelligence like a large glass of water. And did you know 12 ounce iq? That's mine by the way.
[2023.32s -> 2033.74s]  I said that in pre-stream chat. It's a child star bonanza. You failed it. I was waiting. I was
[2033.74s -> 2039.74s]  waiting for an opportunity to use it. Hey you know you're brilliant. No you're brilliant. You
[2039.74s -> 2043.99s]  got the fucking iq like a glass of water. And then they're gonna be like what the fuck is he
[2043.99s -> 2048.28s]  talking about? And then on the car ride home. The car ride home they're gonna be going
[2049.58s -> 2065.00s]  wah fucking like 16 ounces that motherfucker. Well that's nice. What is? If you'll excuse us
[2065.00s -> 2070.36s]  we've got shopping to do. Take a copy of the eyeball video while you're at it. It will change
[2070.36s -> 2074.44s]  your life. We talked about that in the pre-stream chat. I'm glad I got a chance to say it.
[2077.94s -> 2092.04s]  12 ounce iq. All right so did I get a video? All right good. That joke is horrible. It doesn't
[2092.04s -> 2097.08s]  matter. I needed to say it. I am not getting in that thing again. It took me weeks to get
[2097.08s -> 2105.10s]  the fishy smell out of my fur. Tongues placed on freezer become property of Bosco. I got quite
[2105.10s -> 2113.18s]  a few tongues that week. Public restrooms. Unholy temples to all things unsanitary. I wouldn't go
[2113.18s -> 2120.94s]  in there for all the tea and tea landia. I'll do it. Tea landia. Lots of terror.
[2121.74s -> 2130.98s]  Uh oh. He's gonna pee his pants? Time out for number one. Looks like he opened his flood gates.
[2130.98s -> 2136.70s]  I hope he enjoys it as much as I did. He's playing terror. All right hold on he's not over here anymore.
[2136.70s -> 2146.42s]  Can we go over here? The crate that delivers Bosco's terror. I mean he's in the bathroom right now. I
[2146.42s -> 2153.38s]  wonder if I can do something. I don't like to use public restrooms actually.
[2154.34s -> 2160.98s]  Land mines. What the fuck? Children preserve fluids. I wonder if Bosco used the fluid sample I
[2160.98s -> 2172.86s]  submitted. I hope not. What's over here? So what would I got? I got boxing glove bowling ball.
[2173.82s -> 2179.16s]  Yeah hold on. Get back uh get back in there.
[2179.16s -> 2197.50s]  Okay can I put the bowling ball in here? Like weigh him down?
[2198.14s -> 2211.96s]  But wizard would take it and then where would I be? I was trying to like plant the gun in there.
[2212.36s -> 2218.66s]  I don't know why. Why would I want to like plant a gun?
[2222.04s -> 2228.68s]  I'll need a new skull but otherwise no complaints. Bosco is a gun free zone. Gun free? Sartre was
[2228.68s -> 2234.36s]  right. Purgatory really is a convenience store. Don't make me laugh little buddy. It jiggles my
[2234.36s -> 2242.54s]  sensitive cranium. Okay so I'm not sure I can do anything here because the crate that delivers
[2242.54s -> 2248.33s]  Bosco's terror. That's what he used to deliver. I think I'm gonna have to probably do.
[2251.05s -> 2256.73s]  I'm probably gonna have to put a tape. Okay I'm gonna have to put a tape in here
[2257.29s -> 2266.15s]  so he delivers it somewhere right? Oh hold on. Sliced cheese.
[2266.79s -> 2273.11s]  Well it is on special and we are running dangerously low. Did I take it?
[2274.54s -> 2280.62s]  Cheddar cheese this time. Okay a cheese sign on an empty table. The tantalizing promise of cheese
[2280.62s -> 2288.81s]  crushed by cruel reality. Lottery tickets. One dollar lottery tickets. Two dollars. I'm feeling
[2288.81s -> 2297.75s]  lucky already. Time is it seven? Is that clock correct? Well it's only got one hand so probably
[2297.91s -> 2307.90s]  there was a minute hand. We're going to try anything. No trash? Hot weenies. Hot weenies.
[2311.18s -> 2317.50s]  This rampant weenie cannibalism turns my stomach. Have I ever played Monkey Island? I have played
[2317.50s -> 2323.50s]  Monkey Island before. What do we have here? Organ trader? Self-loading weekly? Oh let me see that.
[2326.89s -> 2332.17s]  Hey Bosco what can I do for you? All right uh we want to we want to buy something. We'd like
[2332.17s -> 2336.97s]  to patronize your fine establishment my good man. By patronize you he means we want to buy
[2336.97s -> 2341.85s]  stuff from you not mock you. We probably will mock you but that's not what he meant. I know
[2341.85s -> 2348.97s]  what he meant. Don't patronize me. So what do you want to buy? Uh the cheese please. I was already
[2348.97s -> 2358.09s]  doing it. I already bought it. What have you got? Well I still got that big sale on cheese. Oh yeah
[2358.09s -> 2364.01s]  cheese. I want that. And I might have another item of interest behind the counter. What do you got
[2364.01s -> 2368.09s]  behind the counter? What's my what is it? I accept your thinly veiled invitation to ask about the
[2368.09s -> 2372.65s]  item behind the counter. Oh it's just a little something I like to call a tear gas grenade
[2372.65s -> 2378.57s]  launcher. Tear gas grenade launcher? Oh yeah I really want that. It's the latest in Bosco tech
[2378.57s -> 2384.65s]  innovation. It'll clear out a room of militant college students in no time guaranteed. I feel
[2384.65s -> 2396.01s]  really close to you right now. You sell cheese in in a tear gas grenade launcher? Do you have
[2396.01s -> 2405.99s]  any weasels on a stick? Nope. Do you have any two-handed broadswords? Nope. Do you have any
[2405.99s -> 2413.53s]  vegetables in the shape of famous naturalists? Nope. Do you have any candy pink fat boys? Nope.
[2414.73s -> 2421.42s]  Do you have any exiled political dissidents? Nope. Do you have any weapons of mass destruction?
[2421.50s -> 2430.15s]  Who's asking? Topical, topical humor. Do you have any topical? I've run out of ideas.
[2430.15s -> 2435.99s]  Well you can always just start over again. Good idea. Do you have do you have any weasels on the
[2435.99s -> 2450.71s]  stick? Nope. 2002 2004 topical. I already took the cheese though didn't I? Did I have to pay for it?
[2455.77s -> 2460.97s]  Okay Matt we want this cheese. Okay standard cheese background check. I'll need to see at
[2460.97s -> 2466.25s]  least six forms of ID, a valid federal cheese license, a completed organ donor card, a written
[2466.25s -> 2469.93s]  release signed in the presence of a note of republic, and your school report cards from the
[2469.93s -> 2475.13s]  ninth through twelfth grade. Uh oh. That's I can do all of those except the last one. It's okay Sam.
[2475.13s -> 2480.65s]  I can be brave. We'll just have to struggle cheeselessly onward. Do you guys remember bringing
[2480.65s -> 2489.06s]  into your report card into Chuck E. Cheese? You guys ever have that deal where if you had like
[2489.06s -> 2495.51s]  A's? Yeah Chuck E. Cheese used to do this thing like 10-20 years ago where if you brought in your
[2495.51s -> 2502.79s]  report card and you had A's, straight A's, they would give you free tokens. They would give you
[2502.79s -> 2510.31s]  a bonus tokens. So but what they didn't tell you is that really didn't matter because they didn't
[2510.31s -> 2515.27s]  want anybody to feel bad. So we would go in my mother... I was bad student so I didn't get like
[2515.91s -> 2520.63s]  it wasn't A's and B's by the way. It was like uh S's or something for satisfactory
[2521.43s -> 2525.59s]  needs improvement. There were only like three grades. A for like accomplished or something.
[2526.55s -> 2531.67s]  So I had a terrible report card but we still wanted to go to Chuck E. Cheese and we would go
[2531.67s -> 2536.79s]  and my mother would still try to get them to give the bonus credits for having a good report card
[2536.79s -> 2541.21s]  and the guy behind the counter like just didn't give a shit. So like they they felt bad because
[2541.21s -> 2546.33s]  they would get my brother's report card and be like oh he's doing great free 20 free tokens
[2546.33s -> 2554.73s]  and then they'd get mine and you could see the guy's face just be uh hey so good for you
[2555.70s -> 2565.58s]  20 free tokens. I just got I got them just because they felt bad and I don't know maybe
[2565.58s -> 2571.42s]  maybe my mother was like you give him both that you understand. I don't want him thinking that
[2571.42s -> 2581.93s]  he's like fucking inadequate and the guy's just like okay yeah Chuck E. Cheese actually used to
[2581.93s -> 2591.70s]  do that. We'd like that tear gas grenade launcher. That's really sad. What? 10,000 bucks. Sad? Give
[2591.70s -> 2596.74s]  out like a million tickets. But I didn't know. I just thought we got free tokens. White collar
[2596.74s -> 2602.42s]  crime drive. Where corporate criminals go to rejoice in their ill-gotten gains. After we
[2602.42s -> 2606.74s]  blow this popsicle stand we can go hunt us up one of those starchy cesspiles and hit them where it
[2606.74s -> 2611.54s]  hurts the most. Right in the pocketbook. That's not what I thought you were gonna say but that's good
[2611.54s -> 2626.10s]  too. The man got his token. Still a victory. That's right. I still got the tokens. Look my brother was
[2626.10s -> 2630.90s]  really smart and he like paid the token toll and then we just we're all part of the same family,
[2630.90s -> 2639.26s]  same groups. Give it to us all. Whatever. All right so I can't okay so nothing for us right now.
[2639.26s -> 2647.50s]  Okay can I put the cheese in here? See you later Bosco. Remember. What conversation? I just I just
[2647.50s -> 2653.50s]  accidentally skipped that. He's leeching off his brother. What conversation? Oh brother.
[2658.74s -> 2664.82s]  This is like a dumb like four dollar extra promotion to Chuck E. Cheese 20 years ago.
[2664.82s -> 2672.34s]  Oh wow I can't believe he did that to his brother. Unbelievable. He like conned his brother out of tokens.
[2672.34s -> 2694.42s]  Oh time out. Can I put the cheese in here? If you really love someone give them the cheese.
[2695.62s -> 2698.58s]  What does that do? Can't wait to see the look on his face when he gets it.
[2703.86s -> 2711.05s]  Oh he's trying to leave. I get it. Time out for number one. We're saved. That's a whole lot more
[2711.05s -> 2714.49s]  entertaining when it's not happening to me. It's pretty entertaining either way.
[2715.13s -> 2724.33s]  Hahaha. Oh he wet his widow pants. Who's talking? Is that Sam? Oh I was like what the fuck?
[2728.78s -> 2731.58s]  Good thing I have the other two twerps to handle it.
[2734.46s -> 2735.66s]  It's still not quite right.
[2738.62s -> 2740.70s]  Let me help you out here. You just gonna leave him there?
[2741.50s -> 2764.12s]  Hahaha. Did it for you. Actually evil. So is it that's it? I don't want to wake him up. I got the
[2764.12s -> 2771.67s]  tape. We have to go watch the tape. Nothing else I can do over here. Bosco's got a lot of interesting
[2771.67s -> 2776.39s]  if questionable products in here. I think it's the only store in town where they carry those albino
[2776.39s -> 2781.67s]  monkey crackers I got hooked on in Forneo. Let's get back to it. Why don't you get back to your
[2781.67s -> 2786.15s]  shopping or whatever it was you were doing that back there. Sometimes it's best not to ask.
[2787.59s -> 2791.19s]  I'll let you get back to doing what you're doing or whatever it is you do back there.
[2792.31s -> 2798.81s]  Hey Bosco how are you? That's like Owen Wilson. Hey Bosco. Hey you just gonna leave him there?
[2804.98s -> 2811.62s]  Close. I'll get it. How about a reward? You know we did put the kibosh on that whole terrorist
[2811.62s -> 2818.10s]  operation so. How about some free stuff? Is that why you did this? For free stuff? Was this
[2818.90s -> 2824.42s]  all a part of the plot? Yes a labyrinthine scheme in which we paid off a former child star to deliver
[2824.42s -> 2828.66s]  videos to your store just so that we could knock him out via your own security system and claim
[2828.66s -> 2836.95s]  an undeserved reward. So you admit it. Conspiracy humor may be lost on this crowd. So we don't get
[2836.95s -> 2844.49s]  anything. Nice place you got here. Where's our stuff? What's so nice about it? Nice name. Nice
[2844.49s -> 2848.97s]  security measures. Hey you got a good security. What's with the maximum security prison motif?
[2848.97s -> 2854.73s]  You've been robbed as many times as I have you do to say. I've never been robbed actually but then I
[2854.73s -> 2859.21s]  typically point a large firearm at anyone who approaches me. You crack me up little buddy.
[2861.85s -> 2871.98s]  Why that's a that's that you didn't even laugh. I don't I mean that's the line. I've heard he said
[2871.98s -> 2882.60s]  the line right. I've heard that before but he didn't laugh. Not even like a you crack me up
[2882.60s -> 2890.68s]  little buddy. No no he didn't laugh. He's liar. What were we talking about? He's liar. No he's liar.
[2890.68s -> 2911.03s]  Sleep with two eyes open. He's being sarcastic. He's liar. This game looks like borderland. Hey
[2911.03s -> 2917.51s]  specs. Hey you remember when you were french? Um okay but let's watch the tape. We've got a
[2917.51s -> 2932.04s]  don't we all. Any other things to click on? That's the office. What about over here? One way. One way
[2932.04s -> 2937.16s]  dead end. Street signs are such fitting metaphors for the human condition. Remind me to refill your
[2937.16s -> 2945.45s]  prescriptions. Dead end sign. Uh let's go watch. Hold on let's go watch the tape. They say graffiti
[2945.45s -> 2952.47s]  is the poetry of our time. I keep seeing giraffe like giraffe. Giraffe. I see the word giraffe. It's
[2952.47s -> 2963.66s]  the font that's making me do that. It's the same word without the t's or something.
[2967.34s -> 2975.42s]  Or something. Let's watch the tape before I make a fool out of myself even more. Okay Max ready for
[2975.42s -> 2981.10s]  that ocular workout. No stop. We don't have any popcorn. Sweet alligator dentures soaking in
[2981.10s -> 2989.59s]  formaldehyde. That was close. Quick before it starts. Hello I'm Brady culture. You may remember
[2989.59s -> 2996.07s]  me from culture's clubhouse. The massive worldwide television hit that ran for six episodes in 1970.
[2997.35s -> 3005.27s]  What you are about to see will change your life forever. So watch closely. Now listen up you
[3005.35s -> 3010.10s]  tasteless philistines. I knew I told you it was gonna be a hypnosis thing.
[3012.94s -> 3023.02s]  To name all your children after me. I love you. I adore you. I want to name all my children after
[3023.02s -> 3030.38s]  you. Sam look. Ocular fitness my eye. That videotape hypnotized Jimmy Tootie. I think I like him better
[3030.38s -> 3035.34s]  this way. We've got to find this Brady culture and stop it before he hypnotizes every consumer
[3035.34s -> 3040.46s]  of cheap self-help videos. Can I have his hair when we're done? Only if you keep it on a leash.
[3041.58s -> 3047.35s]  All right now we're time for some investigative work here. Let's check the entry. Nobody ever
[3047.35s -> 3055.50s]  leaves us messages anymore. Can I call somebody? Can I call the chief? Send over another gargantuan
[3055.50s -> 3063.13s]  anchovies and hot sauce special please. You know that's been a meme ever since the ninja turtles
[3064.01s -> 3070.26s]  anchovies on pizza but I've been told that it's actually fantastic.
[3076.28s -> 3088.86s]  That's the joke right? Anchovies. Apparently it's really really good. Okay so what can I get
[3088.86s -> 3096.46s]  should I take the tape back out? This is evidence right? I need to hold on to this. All right so we
[3096.46s -> 3104.62s]  know that this is a plot to hypnotize everybody and cause problems so anchovies on pizza are
[3104.62s -> 3108.78s]  very normal here in Italy and are one of the classic pizzas in Napoli. Yeah see that's what
[3108.78s -> 3120.54s]  I'm saying like I don't know where this meme joke came from. Okay there's another uh there's
[3120.54s -> 3132.09s]  another there's another giraffe over there. Fishes are stinky and yucky. Meme know what?
[3133.19s -> 3141.62s]  They say graffiti is the poetry of our time. Just what we need more lame poetry. It's not a meme
[3141.62s -> 3151.54s]  they just don't taste good. Meme is the word that everybody uses now. I would I'm just trying to fit
[3151.54s -> 3158.60s]  in. This place used to be Lefty's tool rental shop. Good old Lefty. I'll miss him. You couldn't
[3158.60s -> 3164.44s]  stand Lefty. He once poked him in the eye with the number three socket spanner. Exactly. Good times.
[3165.80s -> 3176.81s]  How do you do fellow kids? Spray paint. Hey a can of spray paint and it's not even empty.
[3176.81s -> 3186.70s]  So are we gonna go fuck with these paintings? Spray over it? This could use a little improvement.
[3192.52s -> 3200.54s]  Hey hey hey you messed it up. Oh fix it Rainfreeze. Okay so that takes me away from the other one.
[3204.57s -> 3207.53s]  What what was he doing on the other one? Was he guarding something?
[3214.98s -> 3220.34s]  Is this some kind of currency thing? I don't know. They say graffiti is the poetry of our time.
[3220.34s -> 3228.60s]  Just what we need more lame poetry. You guys like got me all messed up with that improvement.
[3228.60s -> 3231.24s]  I keep seeing that and I just remember how many times I said it.
[3231.24s -> 3239.34s]  What are you doing? Don't mess with my painting. I've got to fix it all up.
[3240.06s -> 3248.20s]  Okay so I can make it. I can move him around. So he'll he's gonna fix that one. He'll run over
[3248.20s -> 3255.53s]  and fix this one. Maybe okay so in stand here he goes really fast. I'm gonna hold the boxing glove
[3255.53s -> 3260.81s]  out and he's gonna run into my fist. And it's gonna break his like he's gonna fall down and
[3260.81s -> 3263.85s]  it's gonna hurt him. But I didn't do it though. He just wasn't looking where he was going.
[3275.58s -> 3282.09s]  Uh let's go first. Let me go in here first. Tempering with the mail is a federal offense
[3282.09s -> 3287.13s]  punishable by fine and imprisonment. As we found out after the incident with the garden hose.
[3287.13s -> 3296.98s]  Ah memories. I heard it was a little loud so I'm trying to get down.
[3297.78s -> 3305.53s]  Oh okay mailbox. This is Sybil's piercings tattoo psychic therapy.
[3307.82s -> 3323.58s]  Save it. Now it's too quiet. Oh let me check the alley way here. Is there any alley? No.
[3331.37s -> 3344.84s]  Car. Where are we going Sam? Let's go give a ticket to a rich criminal. Let's go cruise for
[3344.84s -> 3350.90s]  lawbreakers Max. And drive around. Are we getting Nicole Letagrade here? Is that possible?
[3359.16s -> 3363.32s]  By the way Sam I'm not sure if I mentioned this but I may have accidentally chewed through our
[3363.32s -> 3368.92s]  brake lines. No I don't think you did mention that. I guess we'll just have to slow down by violently
[3368.92s -> 3382.33s]  rear-ending other motorists. Already planning on it little buddy. How do I? Oh I didn't know
[3382.33s -> 3392.30s]  it is plus a full letter grade okay. Is there any consequences? Are there no consequences?
[3397.13s -> 3406.87s]  Take the wheel little buddy. Why can I do this? What? Please accept my condolences for your
[3406.87s -> 3425.90s]  table line. This is so. Where am I supposed to go? Okay I just crashed into that guy.
[3426.54s -> 3441.22s]  I'm still on the other side of the road. Office. I don't have anywhere else to go.
[3442.02s -> 3449.66s]  You can use the keyboard to move. WASD doesn't do anything. Up down left right doesn't do anything.
[3450.46s -> 3458.90s]  I think this is I don't have I only have one destination which is the office area.
[3459.70s -> 3473.27s]  That was all right that was pretty sick. We just drove around in a circle.
[3477.45s -> 3487.37s]  Okay so I'm gonna deal with this guy somehow. Can I go I'm gonna go into Sybil's.
[3488.17s -> 3511.78s]  Delivering onions live. Not a great name. Another one. Welcome you look like you could use some
[3511.78s -> 3517.62s]  therapy. Not from a wide-eyed circus freak like you. Hey it's another one of the soda poppers. Me?
[3518.50s -> 3525.62s]  Right you're um. Peepers. I don't know what you're talking about. My name is Sybil Pandemic.
[3525.62s -> 3534.79s]  Licensed psychotherapist. Fine prove it. About a little analysis. Certainly. Tell me what's bothering
[3534.79s -> 3549.98s]  you. It's not me it's Max. Hey. He thinks he's a rabbit. I am a rabbit. See. Yes well I would
[3549.98s -> 3557.02s]  recommend Brady Culture's Ibo video for this situation. Good eye health helps combat delusions.
[3557.66s -> 3564.62s]  I'm a rabbit. Ibo? Yes my runny poached egg-like eyes could use a workout. You won't regret it.
[3566.60s -> 3571.48s]  Okay well we already know what this is. Who's this lady culture person?
[3571.48s -> 3578.04s]  Brady. Brady Culture. He's only the most insightful and amazing man on the planet.
[3578.04s -> 3586.26s]  That's all. It's not Sean Penn? Not anymore. I'm so disillusioned. All right I know I've got I've
[3586.26s -> 3590.18s]  all right I got the video. Let me just see what you got. I've still got a copy of this cockamamie video.
[3590.18s -> 3598.09s]  I'm all out but they probably still. Yeah. Well you're not Sybil. Are you sure your name is Sybil
[3598.09s -> 3605.77s]  not Peepers? Absolutely. Sybil Pandemic licensed psychotherapist. That's me. He's trying to pull a
[3605.77s -> 3612.81s]  fast one Sam. Where's your gun? Violence is not the answer. Those eyes. Sam we're dealing with a
[3612.81s -> 3621.59s]  dangerously delusional psychotic here. Obviously. Uh we'll do all the options. Sybil's normally a
[3621.59s -> 3626.71s]  girl's name isn't it? Must have been tough while you were growing up. Why do you think I became a
[3626.71s -> 3633.56s]  licensed psychotherapist? You have any ID? Could we see your driver's license or some sort of ID?
[3633.56s -> 3639.24s]  Sybil. My psychotherapy license is hanging over there on the wall. How about something with a
[3639.24s -> 3645.48s]  picture on it you obvious lunatic you? I could draw one on there if it would put your mind at ease.
[3645.48s -> 3652.62s]  Draw one? Oddly I don't think it would. You sure look like Peepers. You're a dead ringer for Peepers from that old
[3652.62s -> 3659.66s]  soda popper show. I get that a lot but I'm Sybil Pandemic licensed psychotherapist. Right.
[3663.10s -> 3671.26s]  Excuse me for a minute would you? Let's take a look at this. Diplomas, uh tattoo chair.
[3673.03s -> 3681.59s]  I don't know what I have for items. Punching bag, bowling ball, spray paint, cactus. It's eerily
[3681.59s -> 3689.98s]  lifelike for a fake plant. The same could be said for a lot of our friends. It's eerily lifelike for
[3690.06s -> 3699.40s]  the same. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right. What about the desk? Newton's balls. Can I play with that?
[3699.40s -> 3707.27s]  Oh it's good exercise for the eyes but Brady culture's eyeball video is better. Can I play with
[3707.27s -> 3718.20s]  that? That voice is familiar. Ah the tiki. Hold over from the days when you could sell all kinds
[3718.20s -> 3724.84s]  of cheap crap without a successful children's television show. Envious? A little. Okay intercom.
[3724.84s -> 3732.92s]  Hello is anybody there? Can't check the desk. Oh what about okay I want to go in the in the
[3732.92s -> 3739.24s]  closet there. I think those might be iron-ons. Convenient and painful. A sure-fire hit with
[3739.24s -> 3745.96s]  the average consumer. An iron-on tattoo? That looks comfortable. Oh it is. How would you know? You
[3745.96s -> 3754.55s]  don't have a tattoo. Don't I? Relax. That may be the least relaxing sign I've ever seen. Relax.
[3754.55s -> 3759.67s]  How about the one at the barbershop that says low fatality rate? I stand corrected. Oh I would
[3759.67s -> 3766.47s]  never let somebody shave me. I have this extreme fear of being shaved by somebody. No I don't think
[3766.47s -> 3774.15s]  so. Skin art. Is that art for skin or art made from skin? Your ideas are effervescent pustules
[3774.15s -> 3779.51s]  Max. I have this extreme fear and it's completely irrational and you can judge me all you want
[3779.51s -> 3784.07s]  but I imagine myself sitting in the barber chair and talking to whoever it is that's
[3784.07s -> 3793.46s]  shaving me currently and they just like and I'm just dead. I don't know why I just always think
[3793.46s -> 3808.76s]  about that. It's completely irrational. Sweetie talk yeah there's too many forms of media of that.
[3809.40s -> 3824.23s]  Plus I have a very sensitive face. I gotta be very careful like I use a very specific particular
[3824.23s -> 3834.49s]  razor. If I go and do a like a hot shave and they're just like I cut up there I cut easily
[3834.49s -> 3844.34s]  on my face. I know no they get like the thing they have a towel and they have that piece of
[3844.34s -> 3852.26s]  leather that they take the big knife it's like a machete and they go put your head back.
[3852.74s -> 3869.19s]  It's scary. I'm sure it's nice. Thank god I've been locked in that closet so long I was
[3869.19s -> 3874.23s]  starting to invent life stories for the mothballs. The leather is the skin from the last guy. Oh my
[3874.23s -> 3880.87s]  god he's still here? Call a cop. You're in luck ma'am. Sam and Max we're freelance police. What the
[3880.87s -> 3885.83s]  civil pandemic licensed psychotherapist nice to know you. Arrest that lunatic immediately.
[3886.79s -> 3895.91s]  But he's my pal. What's the charge? Assault, kidnapping, identity theft. Those are good
[3895.91s -> 3901.83s]  charges. Some of my favorites and what about mopery? He locked me in the closet and he's been
[3901.83s -> 3909.27s]  pretending he's me. Gadzooks why? Well these cases can be very complicated and delicate.
[3909.27s -> 3914.79s]  There may be repressed feelings of inadequate transference or latent unwarranted hypochondriac
[3914.87s -> 3921.43s]  Freudianism. Come again? He's a complete whack job although actually now that I look closely
[3921.43s -> 3929.43s]  I think he's been hypnotized. Oh really? What can we do? Are there steps we can take? Soothing music
[3929.43s -> 3935.11s]  or perhaps some sort of invasive surgery? Shock treatment! Shock treatment! Typically a hypnotic
[3935.11s -> 3941.03s]  state can be revised after rendering the subject susceptible to new input. Sorry I don't speak
[3941.03s -> 3945.03s]  psychotherapist. You've got to knock them unconscious to bring them out of it.
[3947.99s -> 3954.33s]  I can demonstrate on this guy if you'll knock him out for me. Consider it done. I thought he's
[3954.33s -> 3961.53s]  just gonna go do it. All right so here this is what we've got this for. I can see you. Whoa
[3961.53s -> 3970.38s]  where'd he go? Hey there he is. You a therapist? How could you? Just comes naturally I guess.
[3975.86s -> 3979.06s]  Okay so we're gonna knock him out. How do we knock you out?
[3985.06s -> 4017.40s]  Whip the door open really fast and hit him right in the head with it? I can see you. He runs. I can
[4017.40s -> 4023.56s]  see. Whoa where'd he go? Hey there he is. All right how do we keep him here? How do we keep him from
[4023.56s -> 4055.56s]  moving? Where's he running to? I can see you. What can you tell me about this? Oh it's marbles.
[4055.64s -> 4059.24s]  Change my life. You should watch it as soon as you possibly can.
[4063.29s -> 4074.17s]  I have the strangest urge to redecorate. Fight it Sam. Fight it. Okay like spray him. I don't think
[4074.17s -> 4084.33s]  that would be in. All right what are you telling me? Hello. I meant the other civil. So you guys
[4084.33s -> 4092.76s]  gonna take care of this imposter or what? Just throw the phone at him. I think there may be other
[4092.76s -> 4097.72s]  victims of hypnosis besides yours lurking around the neighborhood. Make that really really cool
[4098.36s -> 4108.36s]  unconscious as well. Oh boy when it comes off the latch it goes like it's a great audio cue
[4108.36s -> 4113.43s]  for a lot of things. What happened to your tattoo business? Don't tell me they actually
[4113.43s -> 4118.79s]  enforce those health code violations. No no of course they don't but a guy came in here and
[4118.79s -> 4124.71s]  asked me to put a ship on his chest and I misheard him and well I decided to hang it up after that.
[4125.67s -> 4133.74s]  Okay I don't think I've ever been in here. You're right across the street from us and I don't think
[4133.74s -> 4138.94s]  I've ever been in here before today. Your friend has. He's always trying to con me into giving him
[4138.94s -> 4144.14s]  some kind of weird tattoo for free. You could put a line on my head and some eyes on my butt
[4144.14s -> 4153.91s]  and I look like I was upside down. For the last time no. Excuse us we've got work to do. I'll say.
[4153.99s -> 4159.42s]  All right let me what about the couch? Let me look at the couch.
[4162.07s -> 4165.83s]  I've got half a mind to stretch out. I think you have to stretch the whole thing
[4165.83s -> 4173.27s]  or it rips. You baffle me. You crack me up sometimes Max. You make me laugh Max.
[4173.99s -> 4179.88s]  All right let's get out of here. Let me try to deal with the other guy. I think I need something
[4179.88s -> 4195.54s]  else. What do I have for items? Bowling ball, boxing glove, videotape, spray paint. So I can spray paint
[4195.54s -> 4206.31s]  that. Can I go faster? Somebody said that I could double click. I'm not doing it.
[4209.66s -> 4220.09s]  Because he's here and then he runs that way. What is he standing on here? Can I like drop him through
[4220.09s -> 4236.84s]  this? Shift click. No. Well let me paint the graffiti here. Let me just see what happens.
[4236.84s -> 4247.51s]  That gets him away from there. But I'm not sure what that does. Because that just gets him over
[4247.51s -> 4262.73s]  here. So now I can't just like punch him in the back of the head.
[4276.14s -> 4302.68s]  So they move so fast. All right so then there's another one. Wait there's two. There's one here
[4302.68s -> 4316.68s]  too. Okay so there's three.
[4334.66s -> 4340.10s]  I didn't see this. I forgot this one existed. Because then that means now he's over here.
[4340.10s -> 4360.41s]  Okay yeah watch this. He's gonna be right here. And that's when we shoot him. I'm kidding. I'm
[4360.41s -> 4369.53s]  kidding. I'm kidding. I know. I know. I know. I know. Can you believe we get paid for this?
[4370.57s -> 4376.57s]  I love this country. This would actually kill somebody. Like he's dead. He made me mess up.
[4377.85s -> 4384.01s]  That's the last words that person's ever gonna say. Now this is quality television.
[4385.56s -> 4393.10s]  Except my evil plan is in jeopardy. That person's skull crushed down into their spine. And their
[4393.10s -> 4394.54s]  brain was disintegrated.
[4404.78s -> 4410.55s]  That's two. So the third one. How do I knock out the third one?
[4414.42s -> 4419.91s]  What do I got? It's definitely something to do with this. Something to do with the boxing glove.
[4421.51s -> 4424.71s]  Put it somewhere that he runs into or let me go let me go look at the body.
[4425.67s -> 4442.86s]  He'll be out for a good while. Yeah forever actually.
[4443.66s -> 4457.29s]  He'll be out forever. Is there anything else down here? Takes me back to my childhood. Okay we got
[4457.29s -> 4464.09s]  more. We got stinky's. Stinky's diner. I can't go there. What with the van?
[4478.78s -> 4486.70s]  This one's this guy's dead too. What are you doing? Hey Bosco. Hey you just gonna leave him there?
[4487.18s -> 4498.62s]  Uh we want to buy something. What do you got your eye on? We'd like that tear gas grenade launcher.
[4498.62s -> 4503.82s]  That'll be ten thousand dollars. Oh were you serious about that? It's a bargain. Trust me.
[4503.82s -> 4508.86s]  Trust me. I never trust a man that says trust me twice. We gotta find an illegally wealthy
[4508.86s -> 4517.74s]  motorist and quick. Nothing. Okay so we gotta go. Thanks Bosco. Rest somebody for money and then
[4517.74s -> 4528.63s]  get the money and get the tear gas. I'm gonna go. How am I gonna get ten thousand dollars in tickets?
[4539.37s -> 4545.70s]  Just one big ticket. Where we going Sam? That's a lot. All right let's go give a ticket. That's
[4545.70s -> 4562.89s]  where that's for. All right here we go. Okay so we gotta pull over somewhere by running into them.
[4563.69s -> 4576.36s]  Like this guy. All right you're under arrest. This is your first and final warning. Pull over or die.
[4577.24s -> 4586.92s]  Click on the report card. Get doped. And you're not Ergo. We call the shops around here.
[4586.92s -> 4598.57s]  Oh why did you stop me? Hideously broken tail light. Indecent exposure. We're booking you sorry
[4598.57s -> 4605.05s]  hide for indecent exposure. What are you talking about? I'm fully clothed. Accept your face. Get
[4605.05s -> 4613.83s]  a veil please. Let's go Max. Having that face is punishment enough. That's two cops. Two police
[4613.83s -> 4618.95s]  officers say that to you. No one seems to be breaking the law today. I know what's the problem.

[4675.51s -> 4692.22s]  of something. Again what terrible cops. Imagine a cop had to make a mental note out loud in front
[4692.22s -> 4697.10s]  of you that you didn't do anything wrong and they need to pull over for the did things wrong.
[4698.22s -> 4708.74s]  Well how am I supposed to tell him? He was doing something illegal. We're doing illegal shit. Nobody
[4708.74s -> 4723.86s]  else is. I can't like break it? That didn't break his tail light? How is me crashing into

[4775.34s -> 4783.98s]  what's the fine for a broken tail light? $10,000. Why isn't it $10,000? What are you crazy? What? Oh
[4783.98s -> 4790.47s]  one moment allow me to confer with my legal counsel. My attorney has advised me to pay the
[4790.47s -> 4817.30s]  fine. What kind of inflation is the economy to happen to you? Bad. Jesus. All right I got 10 grand.
[4824.28s -> 4829.16s]  Yeah you gotta figure if you would just pay that fine something fucked up is really going on in
[4829.16s -> 4839.27s]  your current life. You will have to be like a super criminal. This probably like a $500,000
[4839.27s -> 4847.90s]  worth of cocaine in that person's car or something. I got a million dollars in fucking like cocaine
[4847.90s -> 4853.34s]  in this car. That'll be $10,000. Okay yeah doesn't mean you're gonna leave me alone. Yeah okay bye.
[4854.06s -> 4867.14s]  Hey Bosco. Hey that's the only reason why that makes sense. We want to buy something. What do you
[4867.14s -> 4874.95s]  got your eye on? We got your tear gas money right here. Really? All right here you go. One tear gas
[4874.95s -> 4882.33s]  grenade launcher. This is a salad shooter filled with onions. But it works. Trust me. Trust me.
[4882.41s -> 4889.74s]  Now put that away before someone gets hurt. What do you mean? The 10,000 just covered the cost
[4889.74s -> 4900.70s]  of materials you know. Oh I'm sure. It's okay everybody. I'm all right. Well you knew there
[4900.70s -> 4908.71s]  was a kind of it had to be a gag there somewhere. It's an onion. It's a salad. It's an onion shooter.
[4910.01s -> 4918.23s]  It's tear gas. It'll make you cry. When we shoot this at the shoot the onion at the
[4919.19s -> 4931.98s]  popper's face. Watch him cry and then punch him. Is this just going to be a one-off or
[4931.98s -> 4937.29s]  I'm going to play the rest of the game? I'm open to play the rest of the season.
[4942.74s -> 4947.86s]  This is cool. I'm just just hanging out. It's like a relaxing little experience. It's yeah I like it.
[4949.43s -> 4955.35s]  Oh Sybil. Yes. Uh the other Sybil. What is that? Don't worry this won't hurt a bit.
[4955.35s -> 4977.83s]  But it will make you cry. He's already crying. I can see you. What? Hey there he is. You attack
[4977.83s -> 4985.46s]  just comes naturally. They got a big fail safe in the game's engine here to make that not possible.
[4986.44s -> 5002.74s]  Oh Sybil. Now Peepers this is going to hurt us a lot more than it's going to hurt you.
[5003.38s -> 5010.34s]  Just kidding. It'll definitely hurt you more. Sweet dreams Peeps. I can see you.
[5011.70s -> 5019.14s]  Oh my that was great. That was great. Wait a second. My evil plan is in ruins.
[5019.14s -> 5024.66s]  The dog and bunny will rue the day they crossed me. Rue the day I say.
[5024.66s -> 5034.52s]  That was good. That was really good this time. Now I can try to bring him out of his hypnotic state.
[5035.24s -> 5042.12s]  Take control of your mind. I don't think he can hear you. Sure he can. He's unconscious. Not dead.
[5042.68s -> 5051.80s]  Minor detail. Destroy the intruder in your dreams. Regain control. What? Hey what am I doing here?
[5051.80s -> 5057.96s]  What's going on? Wait can we get him to sing the song? My name's not Sybil. It's Peepers.
[5058.60s -> 5069.08s]  Oh yes it is. Are you okay? How do you feel? I've got a weirdest dream. And there was someone
[5069.08s -> 5077.16s]  unusual in your dream wasn't there? Yes Brady Culture was there. He kept telling me to do stuff.
[5077.88s -> 5084.60s]  Aha. I knew it. That fiend hypnotized you to do his unspeakable bidding. Peepers what's the last
[5084.60s -> 5091.56s]  thing you can remember? I remember checking in at Brady Culture's home for former child stars.
[5091.56s -> 5096.76s]  He has his own nut house? Wow we gotta meet this guy. Where can we find this home for former child
[5096.76s -> 5103.88s]  stars? Oh it's very secret. No one must ever find it. Think of a scandal. Five o'clock shadow? But we need
[5103.88s -> 5108.76s]  to find it so we can stop the madness. I thought he was like huffing spray paint. I want to help but
[5108.76s -> 5117.40s]  I just can't remember where it is. Oh brothers might. They went with me. Hey I didn't do anything
[5117.40s -> 5129.80s]  really embarrassing did I? Nothing a simple exorcism can't fix. Oh dear. Witness him.
[5132.39s -> 5139.22s]  All right let's do it. So wait is there anything else I can do in here? Do you have anything else
[5139.22s -> 5146.18s]  for me? Hey doc. Hey Sam thanks for taking care of that wacko. Oh we could use another 10 grand.
[5146.18s -> 5151.94s]  Have you got 10 grand? I'm new at this. I have a lot of student loans. Great loan us a student. I
[5151.94s -> 5160.06s]  can ride it around like a pony. It's nice to see you show such enthusiasm. Security. You don't have
[5160.06s -> 5166.34s]  security back there. That button's not connected to anything. Max might like a tattoo. Oh yeah I
[5166.34s -> 5171.14s]  want a map of the Netherlands on my Netherlands. I get the cold shivers just thinking about
[5171.14s -> 5176.66s]  remembering hearing you say that. I'm out of the tattoo business anyway. I'm a licensed psychotherapist.
[5177.62s -> 5184.15s]  Can you fix cars? Ours sometimes makes a noise like an orangutan with the dry heaves. Um that's
[5184.15s -> 5189.67s]  my fault. I've been keeping an orangutan in the trunk. Oh never mind. I'm not much of a mechanic
[5189.67s -> 5195.61s]  anyway except with unicycles. All right well let's get an analyst. I suppose you could psychoanalyze
[5195.61s -> 5201.53s]  me. Hey yeah I could count your marbles for you. I have a license you know. Will this be painful?
[5201.53s -> 5205.77s]  Only if we do it right. Now there are a couple things we can try. We could look at some ink
[5205.85s -> 5209.85s]  plots. We could try some free association. I could interpret your dreams for you.
[5211.69s -> 5216.73s]  Let's try ink plot. How do ink blots work? And can we make them ourselves? It's easy. I just
[5216.73s -> 5222.01s]  show you some pictures and you tell me what you see. Your responses can reveal things like
[5222.01s -> 5228.41s]  obsessions or obsessions. Let's get psychoanalyzed on screen. Take a look at this and tell me what
[5228.41s -> 5237.83s]  you see. Uh that's Goro from Mortal Kombat about to do a fatality to me. It's a point of view.
[5240.66s -> 5249.43s]  See he's like fucking running at me. Uh okay pennies on the eyes of a dead mime. I don't see
[5249.43s -> 5257.24s]  a pair of oxen boxing in a rowboat. I don't see that either. Susan Lucci holding an emmy.
[5259.19s -> 5265.56s]  I don't see that either. The results of the last time I let Max drive. I mean that's it could be
[5265.56s -> 5277.05s]  like like flat. The results of the last time I let Max drive. All right now how about this one?
[5277.85s -> 5285.35s]  Okay without even looking. This is two old ladies. These are two old ladies with their hands up. So
[5285.35s -> 5290.95s]  they see like the big bun hair. Two cigarettes. Two old ladies back to back about to do a duel
[5290.95s -> 5295.91s]  with cameras. They're selfie dueling. That's what I see first of all first and foremost before I
[5295.91s -> 5302.76s]  look at anything. Okay a bunch of bacteria playing basketball. I don't see that. Pigeons
[5302.76s -> 5310.65s]  on at the marquee at a man's chinese theater. No an SUV crashing into an opulent mansion.
[5311.91s -> 5324.70s]  No the st valentine's day. I no I don't see any. I see like a mustache. No none of this is right.
[5325.34s -> 5347.61s]  Pigeons on the marquee. No SUV. I would probably. Pigeons I guess. Pigeons on the marquee at man's
[5347.61s -> 5357.37s]  chinese theater. And this. All right what do I see first of all without looking at it? This is
[5359.78s -> 5363.46s]  this looks like some type of satan or something. Like see like the face. Two eyes. Nose.
[5365.02s -> 5370.94s]  Just looming. Hovering over what looks to be potentially. This is the body. Maybe a body.
[5371.82s -> 5377.08s]  Like it's a goat head. Goat satan. Goat. It's just satan because it's like the legs and like
[5377.08s -> 5389.99s]  the arms and shit. Or it could be multiple entities at the same time. Or like a scorpion
[5389.99s -> 5405.00s]  or something. A squirrel that got run over twice. Now this one. What do you see? Okay this one
[5406.23s -> 5415.26s]  again I see two. It's either okay it's either uh oros from world of warcraft. Like the light
[5415.26s -> 5422.62s]  things. Some of you will get that. Or there's another it's the nose. The face. His hand coming
[5422.62s -> 5431.08s]  out like to dancing like dueling dancing to like circus performers or back to back here
[5431.08s -> 5447.62s]  with doing selfie selfie uh duels. The exhaust manifold of a bread truck. And this one. Uh this
[5447.62s -> 5459.06s]  is a pokemon. This is when it goes like doo doo doo. And it zooms in and then it fades into color
[5459.62s -> 5468.52s]  and they go like. Mujito. That's the only thing I can see. There's been somebody fucked up
[5468.52s -> 5472.44s]  pokemons. I guarantee if you superimpose a pokemon that looks like this on it they're
[5472.44s -> 5485.00s]  they're out of like the 16 000 pokemon that exist now. One of these matches. Pokemon
[5485.72s -> 5492.10s]  is the simpsons of monster character creation. If you think you made up something they already
[5492.10s -> 5498.41s]  have done it. It's just that joke. Do you oh you have like an original monster animal thing that
[5498.41s -> 5502.81s]  you've drawn. No there's a pokemon. There's already like 30 000 of a database has been made.
[5503.53s -> 5516.09s]  A war between two teams of abstract shapes. You seem fairly focused on cars but it's probably
[5516.09s -> 5526.22s]  nothing to worry about anymore. Thanks doc. Wait what? What's free association like? It's a test of
[5526.22s -> 5531.10s]  your reactions to things in your life. I say a word and then you just say or do the first thing
[5531.10s -> 5535.98s]  that comes into your head. Okay. Dance a samba. Recite the alphabet. Scream at the top of my lungs.
[5535.98s -> 5543.90s]  That sort of thing. Interesting. Have we started already? No but now we will. Ready? Is that the
[5543.90s -> 5559.75s]  word? No the word is tumbleweed. Vegas. Oh uh uh uh eucalyptus. Eucalyptus. Interesting. Now try
[5559.75s -> 5570.71s]  this one. Crown. King. Just do or say whatever comes naturally. Frozen concentrated orange juice.
[5570.71s -> 5581.61s]  I see. Comb. Hair. That's not so basic. A pomade. Promenade. What an unusual response.
[5581.61s -> 5587.29s]  Well this has been illuminating. What's the verdict? I'll let you know after years of insanely
[5587.29s -> 5592.17s]  expensive treatment. Anything to support small local businesses. We can always sell organs on
[5592.17s -> 5599.05s]  the black market to raise the cash. Just so they're not ours little buddy. No I would dream. This is
[5599.05s -> 5608.28s]  okay I want to do. Does this exist? Can I take like a total like evaluation somewhere online?
[5608.28s -> 5613.16s]  I want to do this whole thing like like three hours. Can you really learn anything from my
[5613.16s -> 5619.40s]  grotesque nonsensical dreams? Oh absolutely. They reveal your subconscious. It's like peeling an
[5619.40s -> 5625.40s]  onion. Now just relax and try to remember your dream. Yeah I want to stream it. Okay here goes.
[5626.44s -> 5632.36s]  Remember your dream. My dreams always start in the office but this time things were different.
[5633.56s -> 5637.32s]  Yes I can picture it. Tell me what happens. It's called Buzzfeed quizzes.
[5640.84s -> 5644.36s]  No I'm talking about like a real. I realized there was someone else in the room with me.
[5644.36s -> 5650.60s]  Like this costs money and I go get analyzed with a bunch of blots and ink tests and
[5651.40s -> 5654.04s]  questions and that kind of fast responses and we'll see what they do.
[5656.26s -> 5663.22s]  This is me. It was me. You? Hmm I think you represent yourself.
[5663.86s -> 5669.22s]  I didn't even realize that was possible. Oh sure any crazy thing's possible in psychoanalysis.
[5670.02s -> 5677.06s]  Tell me did the other you say or do anything unexpected? No the usual. Hi Sam how are you?
[5677.06s -> 5683.46s]  I'm fine Sam and yourself. Not too shabby. Fascinating. Where does your mind come up with
[5683.46s -> 5691.22s]  this stuff? See I told you me and Sam I get that vibe completely with this because you know like
[5691.22s -> 5703.13s]  hair comb. I didn't notice anything. Then why do you mention it? I don't know. Interesting.
[5703.13s -> 5713.99s]  I wanted the trash. Me then trash then the board. I noticed something bizarre in the closet.
[5713.99s -> 5718.23s]  Yes we put things in the closet we want to hide away things we're ashamed of.
[5718.23s -> 5723.27s]  Please Sam what's in your closet? A bunch of a bunch of shit stained underwear that I don't
[5723.27s -> 5730.46s]  want anyone to see. A whole stack of lottery tickets. Interesting perhaps you feel you don't
[5730.46s -> 5735.90s]  really earn your money. Don't worry lady we get paid to crack skulls and by that measure we
[5735.90s -> 5747.21s]  ought to be millionaires. I noticed something bizarre in the closet. Ah something you're ashamed
[5747.21s -> 5755.13s]  of. What was it? No that's fine lottery tickets. A whole stack of lottery tickets. Don't worry lady.
[5756.84s -> 5761.32s]  All right what else? I tell you sometimes I forget that I'm just like live and I just
[5761.96s -> 5769.24s]  that I'm streaming. I remembered that I'd just gotten something from the bakery.
[5769.24s -> 5774.04s]  Oh sounds like you and your special guest there were having a little lottery ticket today.
[5776.41s -> 5779.61s]  I got a birthday cake, a wedding cake, a fruit cake, a cheesecake.
[5783.70s -> 5789.54s]  It was a cheesecake and I mean literally a piece of cheese and a cake. What does that represent?
[5789.54s -> 5797.78s]  No that doesn't mean anything. It's just random nonsense. That's good. One cheesecake for every
[5797.78s -> 5808.15s]  death in Sekiro. Sounds good Sam. What else is here? Out the window? I prepared to leap out of the
[5808.15s -> 5815.05s]  window. Oh was that the end of your dream? Yes. Yep then I woke up screaming. I can see why.
[5819.21s -> 5825.98s]  Let's examine my obsessions with inkblots. Let's examine my okay hold on. Wait didn't I already do
[5825.98s -> 5830.22s]  some more ink blots? Oh and more ink blots. Sure let's take a look at this and tell me.
[5831.10s -> 5837.37s]  Oh we already did it never mind. Oh shit how do I get out of here? The result. All right now.
[5840.02s -> 5864.04s]  Pitch. And this. A squirt. Now this one. The. And this one. A warby. But it's probably. Next up.
[5864.04s -> 5867.80s]  I got them all. Let's go. Actually let's save the psychoanalysis for later.
[5868.36s -> 5877.75s]  Hmm. Postponing responsibilities. Interesting. Okay so now we can get out of here. Probably.
[5879.45s -> 5884.73s]  That's it for the three um. Unless that's the wrong way. He's instinctively going over there.
[5884.73s -> 5889.85s]  His dream. Remember the lottery tickets? You guys have fucking analyzed. Oh stop analyzing me.
[5891.75s -> 5917.27s]  Don't get out of here. Get out of my head. Okay so now we go back to the office. He thinks he's
[5917.35s -> 5927.24s]  streaming right now. Interesting. Where? They're very weird. He's talking out loud while lying down
[5927.24s -> 5942.07s]  on his back. In the bed. Is he still hypnotized? Tiny hoodlums. No comment.
[5944.31s -> 5951.51s]  Uh anything on tv? On this week's edition of oh is he still alive? We look at the stars of the
[5951.51s -> 5957.67s]  1970s television hit the soda poppers. I love shows that destroy all our cherished delusions
[5957.67s -> 5964.39s]  about the stars we once loved. He's dead. During the soda poppers heyday young specks was the
[5964.39s -> 5969.91s]  role model for obsessive neat freaks all over the globe. Ticker tape free ticker tape parades were
[5969.91s -> 5975.27s]  thrown in honor of the soda popper who never missed a spot. Backstage though things were
[5975.27s -> 5980.31s]  quite a bit dirtier. Speck's obsession with perfection caused massive delays in shooting
[5980.31s -> 5986.95s]  and infuriated co-workers. He famously demanded over 11 000 retakes of the line. You made me mess
[5987.43s -> 5992.23s]  up. Made all the more annoying because of his tendency to repeat the line immediately after
[5992.23s -> 5997.99s]  reading it. Following the show specks was rarely seen in public. Although he did make one ill-fated
[5997.99s -> 6003.99s]  venture into celebrity tag team mud wrestling. Getting on this show someday. As he desperately
[6003.99s -> 6009.43s]  tried to wipe down the ring with a dish rag. The meltdown utterly enraged his tag team partner
[6009.43s -> 6014.87s]  and good friend the dog from my mother the dog who stormed out of the arena without a word.
[6014.87s -> 6019.91s]  They haven't spoken since. Coming up next the soda popper who couldn't always keep it in.
[6023.83s -> 6032.84s]  Well that was okay. Mother of the dog for jerma rumble. Hey tough settle down all right now
[6032.84s -> 6045.24s]  everybody has to join. Where are we going Sam? Settle down all right let's waste precious time
[6045.24s -> 6056.30s]  driving around aimlessly. Let's go cruise for lawbreakers Max. Goodie. Pretty Sam and Max tag
[6056.30s -> 6077.00s]  team though. That seems really possible doesn't it? If it's good enough if I like it. Do I drive
[6077.00s -> 6122.31s]  to a new area? Is this the only the only three locations I can do right now? Where'd the popper
[6122.31s -> 6147.64s]  go? Where'd popper? What is this one? Take control of your mind. I have to like say the line. Is it working? I don't know
[6148.20s -> 6154.04s]  destroy the intruder in your dreams. Snap out of it you big baby. What what's going on?
[6154.76s -> 6162.04s]  Why is my outfit all wrinkled? He's back. Quick act like a chicken. No tell us where we can find
[6162.04s -> 6167.32s]  radio culture's home for former child stars. We've got to stop that fiend from hypnotizing anyone else.
[6167.96s -> 6175.08s]  The home it's 227 something. Wizard would remember this. All right let's go wake up wizard.
[6175.80s -> 6185.00s]  Can you take us there? Are you kidding? I've got hours hours of iron. Well that was helpful.
[6185.88s -> 6209.83s]  What am I doing? Hello. Oh sorry I was doing Donald Duck. I was trying to for a second. Take
[6209.83s -> 6214.39s]  control of your mind. Destroy the intruder in your dreams. It's not gonna happen though. Nicely done
[6214.39s -> 6223.83s]  Sam. You're a natural. Where am I? Who are you? Don't worry we're freelance police. Police? Oh no.
[6224.23s -> 6234.58s]  Oh hey. He's getting away in that truck. Quick follow that soda popper. Oh okay.
[6235.46s -> 6239.75s]  Driving sequence. Hurry Sam he's getting away.
[6240.47s -> 6252.79s]  Oh dropping trash. It's actually kind of hard to tune at the mouse.
[6289.21s -> 6291.40s]  Come here.
[6301.48s -> 6316.87s]  Got it. Yes. I got it. Don't shoot. Aside from the fact that we just plugged your truck
[6316.87s -> 6322.15s]  why would you think we'd shoot you? Except for the obvious sport value of course. It's just you
[6322.15s -> 6326.95s]  always see cops on the news beating up some guy just because he's a former child star.
[6327.51s -> 6331.99s]  We would never dream of hurting former child stars. We just need to find the home where Brady
[6331.99s -> 6338.39s]  Culture keeps them. Oh why didn't you say so? It's right over there across the street.
[6338.39s -> 6348.23s]  Jumping elephant fleas. How devilishly convenient. Thanks. Um does anyone know where I can find a
[6348.23s -> 6365.56s]  bathroom? Here we go. The four Brady Cultures home for former child stars. Where to go first?
[6366.28s -> 6373.24s]  Mall man. Looks like a shifty character to me. Don't they all? I think someone was sitting here.
[6373.24s -> 6382.31s]  And leaking. Okay other door admission forms. Hmm it says here they only treat patients with
[6382.31s -> 6388.39s]  something called artificial personality disorder. Sounds tasty. What's in it? Apparently it's common
[6388.39s -> 6395.19s]  in former child stars. Symptoms include uh let's see obsession with money, violent reactions to
[6395.19s -> 6400.95s]  dentistry, and an unconscious desire to see one's peers getting older. Forsooth! You don't even know
[6400.95s -> 6405.51s]  what that means dude. I went to the dentist today. No but it sounds all classically literate. I went
[6405.51s -> 6413.06s]  to the dentist today. Teeth are fucking clean. They're beautiful. They're perfect. I have two
[6413.06s -> 6418.34s]  cavities I have to get a root canal and I have to change out one of my teeth. One of them is
[6418.34s -> 6433.70s]  completely broken and rotten in the back. So I mean. Hmm it's order a pair and a disturbing
[6433.70s -> 6441.93s]  little monkey. Oh my teeth are fine. You're a monkey? Essentially. I guess this is where you
[6441.93s -> 6448.39s]  stick your admission form. We need an admission form so can I take an admission form? Symptoms form.
[6454.34s -> 6459.78s]  It didn't like it. I bet we have to get that officially filled out. Trust me. Okay so we're
[6459.78s -> 6469.53s]  going to bring this form back to uh Sybil. Home for former gerber rumble stars. All right we got
[6469.53s -> 6475.64s]  the form. Let's bring it back to Sybil. Just click on everything. We got the form. Let's go ahead and
[6476.52s -> 6486.97s]  add inflection at the end of every sentence. Back to the office. Let's get in the car.
[6487.77s -> 6504.04s]  That'll bring us to where we are now. Sybil's office. Is it time for a pee break? Not yet.
[6504.68s -> 6515.46s]  It will be very soon though. I've got news for you. Somebody said shut the fuck up. You're gonna be
[6515.46s -> 6529.42s]  in big trouble if you keep that up. Big trouble. Big trouble. Do you think I might have artificial
[6529.42s -> 6536.94s]  personality disorder? Hmm interesting. Symptoms include uh let's see obsession with money,
[6536.94s -> 6543.18s]  violent reactions to dentistry, and an unconscious desire to see one's peers getting older. Hey I know
[6543.18s -> 6550.86s]  I could psychoanalyze you. You already did. No I already did this. This took like 25 minutes.
[6550.86s -> 6559.14s]  Actually let's save the psycho now. Hmm. Oh god damn it. Symptoms include uh obsession with
[6559.14s -> 6564.26s]  money, violent reactions to dentistry, and an unconscious desire to see one's. Okay so we have
[6564.26s -> 6573.77s]  to take. Hey doc. Hey. How do you like to shrink my head a little? Of course. What? Okay ink blocks.
[6573.77s -> 6578.97s]  Can we do some more? Sure. Take a look. Okay so what was the first thing? It was reactions to
[6578.97s -> 6587.69s]  money. Pennies on the eyes of a dead mime. Pennies on the eyes of a dead mime. Interesting. The next
[6587.69s -> 6596.09s]  thing was. How about this one? The peers getting older. No it was the second one. Uh it was money,
[6596.09s -> 6602.01s]  obsession with money, and then the second one was what? Dentistry. A bunch of bacteria.
[6602.89s -> 6615.85s]  SUV crashing into a mansion. Pigeons. Bacteria. An SUV crashing into an opulent.
[6616.95s -> 6626.73s]  And this? Squirreling around an uncle moth eating. Oh they're all money related okay. My uncle Louie's
[6626.73s -> 6635.45s]  moth eating wallet. Now this one. What do you see? It's like I do money for all these. New York stock
[6635.45s -> 6644.36s]  exchange. Yeah elephants at the New York stock exchange. And this one. So we're just gaming the
[6644.36s -> 6657.00s]  system here right now to get what we want. Debit card. A debit card fed through a document shredder.
[6657.00s -> 6661.96s]  Hmm well judging by your responses you seem to be fairly obsessed with that's a symptom of
[6661.96s -> 6667.32s]  artificial personality disorder. I'd better mark it on your chart. Germa's obsessed with money.
[6668.36s -> 6674.36s]  He's obsessed with it. Very interesting. We should test you for the other symptoms of APD.
[6674.44s -> 6680.44s]  Whatever you say, sawbones. I'm not a sawbones. I'm a psychotherapist. Isn't it weird when you say
[6680.44s -> 6685.64s]  the word money? Hey I'm getting hungry. I don't know why but sometimes I don't know what it is.
[6685.64s -> 6691.88s]  Money. Like what happens on your face when you do it? Say money. Like your your nose scrunches
[6692.44s -> 6699.00s]  and you're like up your upper lip goes up like money. Money. It's a weird fucking word.
[6701.16s -> 6739.77s]  Money. I'll show you. Ready? Watch my face. Um dog. Cat. Hammer. Money. Ball. Dream. Car.
[6741.54s -> 6768.98s]  Money. Money. Money. It's weird. I don't know why I do that. Closet. Money. Race track. Baby.
[6770.18s -> 6793.40s]  Money. All right let's keep going. Let's try some more free association. That will tell us more
[6793.40s -> 6799.16s]  about your unreasonable reactions to the elements of your life. Remember I'll say words and you just
[6799.16s -> 6807.77s]  do or say whatever comes naturally. Ready? Sure go ahead. Cow. So uh this is uh what's this one?
[6808.49s -> 6819.37s]  This is not the one growing older. Dentist. Lamp black. Sample size. Travesty. Is it what what does
[6819.37s -> 6837.88s]  this have to do with the dentist? Cow. Violent reaction to the dentist. Sample size. Mm-hmm. How
[6837.88s -> 6843.34s]  about this word? Drill. Here we go. What do you think of this free association? No no no no Max.
[6843.34s -> 6850.14s]  Seems like a crack. Hmm dialogue. No no no no no no. Hey I'm not imaginary. If you say so. Dryer.
[6850.14s -> 6862.02s]  Just do whatever comes naturally. Shit. Can we stop now? I was not trying to click on Max.
[6862.02s -> 6869.24s]  Am I saying the jerk? Do you think I might? Maybe. Let's try some more free association. That will
[6869.24s -> 6874.20s]  tell us more about your unreasonable reactions to the elements of your life. A punch. Remember I'll
[6874.20s -> 6878.60s]  say words and you just do or say whatever comes naturally. Great job. You just scared the money
[6878.60s -> 6887.19s]  out of my wallet. Have a good night. Lug nut. Thank you for the thank you so much for the money.
[6887.91s -> 6891.21s]  Major clusterfuckers. That's actually this fucking lot of money. Seriously thank you.
[6894.97s -> 6900.57s]  Calorie consciousness. Really? Have a good night as well. Major clusterfuck. Fluoride. Just do or say
[6900.57s -> 6918.81s]  whatever comes naturally. Fluoride. Travesty. Fluoride. Travesty. I thought you might say
[6918.81s -> 6929.03s]  something like that. Teasing. Teasing. Aquamarine. Interesting. Well this has been. Am I? Do you think
[6929.03s -> 6936.33s]  I might? Maybe. No. Let's try. That will tell us. Remember I'll say. Ready? Ready. Interesting
[6936.33s -> 6955.62s]  choice of word. Let's go. Okay. Let's try. Promenade. I see. Polish. Polish. Whoa don't shoot. Violent
[6955.62s -> 6962.26s]  reaction. Violent reaction. You should see him at Thanksgiving. Violent reaction to the word.
[6962.82s -> 6975.77s]  Interesting. Polish. Just do or say whatever comes naturally. Sample size. What an unusual.
[6976.73s -> 6982.49s]  This has been illuminating. All right. Yes. Your responses lead me to believe that you have
[6982.49s -> 6989.21s]  podiatrists. It could be symptomatic of artificial personality disorder. I'd better mark this on your
[6989.21s -> 6997.53s]  chart. What is it? Sample size. You have two of the symptoms listed on this form. Am I deranged?
[6997.61s -> 7003.53s]  I don't want to alarm you but probably. Can I have your hat when they commit you? Sure little buddy.
[7005.88s -> 7010.36s]  I'd like to tell you about another mundane but strangely compelling dream I have. So this is now.
[7010.36s -> 7018.62s]  Right. Let's examine your disturbing subconscious desires a bit further. Okay tell me what happened.
[7020.30s -> 7029.90s]  You're scared of other people getting older. I realized there was someone else in the room with
[7029.90s -> 7044.22s]  me. Oh who was your special guest? So it's not me. Who would it be? Other people. It would be Max
[7044.22s -> 7052.62s]  right? It was Max. Ah yes your imaginary friend. Not you getting older. Excuse me I'm standing
[7052.62s -> 7059.34s]  right next to you lady. In your dream was Max doing anything unusual? Well he was seeing the pledge
[7059.34s -> 7066.22s]  of allegiance to the tune of Camptown Races. I pledge allegiance to my gun dooda dooda. But that's
[7066.22s -> 7078.18s]  not unusual. Okay what was Max doing? What was Max doing? I had just gotten something new from
[7078.18s -> 7088.98s]  the bakery. For a celebration perhaps? What did you get? A birthday cake because they're getting older.
[7088.98s -> 7095.30s]  It was an overly frosted birthday cake. Wait a second. The birthday cake? Your friend? You
[7095.30s -> 7101.86s]  subconsciously want to see your peers get older. I could have told you that. This is a definite
[7101.86s -> 7108.50s]  symptom of artificial personality disorder. Yes I mean I hope it's not serious. I'd better mark
[7108.50s -> 7116.46s]  this on your chart. Mock it on your chart. Wow it must be artificial personality disorder.
[7116.46s -> 7121.50s]  You've got all the signs. I bet I can get a paper out of this. Better ship me off to some sort of
[7121.50s -> 7126.70s]  home for former child stars then. I've signed this admissions form but you'll have to arrange
[7126.70s -> 7132.86s]  your own transportation. I'm about to be really busy publishing the details of your case. Since
[7132.86s -> 7139.82s]  you're crazy can I drive? Jumping vehicular homicide? No. I've been doing that more frequently.
[7143.43s -> 7151.98s]  God that's the wrong door. It's just so close. All right so I got it symptoms form. Let's go turn it in.
[7171.77s -> 7179.90s]  Where we going Sam? Back to Brady Culture's home for former child stars. Oh okay.
[7180.62s -> 7218.89s]  Put it in. You've been accepted. Come on little buddy there's justice to be served. Can we get ice cream afterwards?
[7218.89s -> 7228.74s]  Justice makes me hungry. This reminds me of that place where Aunt Trudy lives with the medicine smell
[7228.74s -> 7234.02s]  and the rubber sheets and the enormous mute Indian. Sounds like a million laughs. Yeah mostly after
[7234.02s -> 7235.94s]  medication time. Where is everyone?
[7238.87s -> 7247.37s]  There he is. Uh-oh. Polk Rutoot above doubts. This is Culture's clubhouse.
[7247.37s -> 7255.99s]  Jumping lawn cheney and a bottle fright wig. Brady Culture I presume. You know who I am.
[7255.99s -> 7261.51s]  Evil plans really do work. Don't get too excited stretch pants. The freelance police are here.
[7262.15s -> 7270.79s]  Yes actually. I've been waiting for you. Really? Next time try leaving the front door open.
[7270.79s -> 7274.87s]  Save us all some grief. Allow me to explain.
[7277.03s -> 7282.31s]  Uh-oh I think we just triggered a soliloquy. Good thing I have the attention span of a pinty yak butter.
[7282.31s -> 7290.07s]  I never wanted much. Just to be universally loved that's all and to be number one in the tv ratings
[7290.07s -> 7296.15s]  for the 1971 fall season. It's doing a lot of really good piano playing. Those worthless hacks.
[7296.15s -> 7302.47s]  The pseudopuppies with their matching shirts and their cute little jingles. They came on opposite
[7302.47s -> 7309.67s]  me and stole my audience. I was never offered another role and now YouTube vigilantes won't
[7309.67s -> 7315.83s]  even let a poor down on his luck actor mass hypnotize the entire viewing public to become
[7315.83s -> 7320.79s]  his worshipful fans forever. It's an organ just mashing on your face against it. It'll sound good.
[7321.67s -> 7328.47s]  I think so. You know that's true. Since you've ruined the beautiful irony of having some of the
[7328.47s -> 7336.31s]  best organ songs are just mashing. I'm afraid you'll just have to take their places. In your
[7336.31s -> 7348.47s]  dreams culture. No my friends in yours. Hey that tickles. Become video delivery man.
[7357.90s -> 7367.82s]  What what's happening? Oh no oh no what what are you doing? I don't know. I you were in on it all
[7367.82s -> 7373.98s]  along. I told you it was a conspiracy. I told you but then you already knew didn't you? You're awake.
[7373.98s -> 7382.94s]  No Bosco. I must deliver videos. Call the CIA. Call Interpol. Call Mickey Rooney. Must deliver
[7382.94s -> 7402.62s]  Mickey Rooney videos. So we have to deliver the videos? Where's Max? I must deliver videos. Hey
[7402.62s -> 7413.85s]  my beloved weapons are gone. I must deliver videos. Give me the cheese. Too far. Too far.
[7415.05s -> 7426.52s]  Uh I tried to get the cheese. All right give me the cheese. Oh don't even try it. I love that part.
[7426.52s -> 7432.01s]  Now somebody come in and tell me that everything's. Hey tell me. Talk to me. Do the spell. The reverse
[7432.01s -> 7442.87s]  spell. Uh oh either I just walked into the Salvador Dali Memorial Wax Museum or I'm dreaming.
[7443.83s -> 7453.54s]  You love me. You adore me. Become video delivery man. Do my evil bidding and so forth.
[7456.02s -> 7461.06s]  Holy brains in a blender. I'm still hypnotized. If only I could remember what Sybil told me to do.
[7462.26s -> 7470.98s]  Destroy the intruder in your dream. Oh yeah. Hey Sam I'm up here. Oh hi little buddy. Do I
[7470.98s -> 7474.98s]  gotta put everybody back together again? You stole my body. I hate when people do that. You gotta
[7474.98s -> 7483.96s]  get me down from here. Okay little guy I'll save you. All right so first things first. Let's take
[7483.96s -> 7492.62s]  your head off. Max's body. Oh and it feels good too. I just love my new furry paws and cute little
[7492.62s -> 7499.62s]  tail. Hey don't touch my tail you psychopathic body stealer. Oh just let me at him. All right
[7499.62s -> 7513.02s]  do I have any items? Like a gun? It's Brady culture on TV. Yes right where I belong. Everyone
[7513.02s -> 7532.95s]  watch me. Me! Shooting TV stars only makes them stronger. Is that? I don't know but I don't know
[7533.03s -> 7550.34s]  if I believe that. Didn't hurt. I don't want to pop him. Smoke. All right I didn't even know this
[7550.34s -> 7560.30s]  is over here. Hold on. It's just a dream Sam. Bicycle pump and the rat. Weird what is this thing?
[7560.30s -> 7567.70s]  Is it bicycle pump it? Now we got a giant rat. Sweet rodent eating disorders. That is one fat rat.
[7569.59s -> 7581.80s]  Oh interesting. What about the closet? He's in the closet too with the cheese. I will be number one
[7581.80s -> 7587.64s]  in the ratings. Now hey Brady cheese. What is it fool? I'd like to introduce you to a little
[7587.64s -> 7592.86s]  friend of mine. Make him big so he gets in there and eats him. Only has like a couple seconds to
[7592.86s -> 7604.70s]  do it though. No the cheese must stand alone. And another one bites the cheese. All right so what
[7604.78s -> 7615.37s]  did that do? Is it empty? All right the smoke probably does something.
[7619.59s -> 7631.86s]  I will be universally strange. What does he say about it? Don't worry little buddy I'll get you.
[7631.86s -> 7639.70s]  Hurry Sam I've got an itch I can't scratch. Guns not gonna do anything. What about the window?
[7641.14s -> 7659.66s]  TV can't shoot the TV. Bicycle pump. Brady culture has a knife. Enigmatic. What's he pointing at?
[7660.54s -> 7695.26s]  Why is he pointing at me? You just following me around? He's not doing it now. Dance puppet dance.
[7697.40s -> 7700.28s]  I think someone needs to turn the lights out on your career Brady.
[7702.68s -> 7713.18s]  That Brady culture he turns the world off with his smile. Coat rack is a pencil. Interesting.
[7713.18s -> 7720.10s]  Can I pick it up? It's just a dream Sam. I cannot pick it up. So what how do I get your head?
[7722.47s -> 7733.94s]  Off of that body. What is this doing here? Hey it's loose. Down? Whoa okay. That was the most fun
[7733.94s -> 7739.54s]  I've had since I lost my body. I gotta get his head. I gotta get his head off. I gotta move him over
[7739.54s -> 7744.66s]  here or get his head off. That was great but Sam if you'll know. Okay hold on. All right how do I
[7744.66s -> 7756.04s]  can I push you over? Brady's stolen Max's. Just let me at him. How do I get how do I move you this
[7756.04s -> 7770.87s]  way? I may not show it much but I love you Sam. Now go wash my car. Uh should I break this open?
[7770.87s -> 7789.50s]  Weird. I may not. Can I turn it the other way? Does it have to go down? Can I move it to the
[7789.50s -> 7815.90s]  other side so it goes left or right? Okay hold on. Whoa gotcha. All right I thought I could.
[7816.86s -> 7824.15s]  How do I get your head off? Can I just tear it off with my bare hands?
[7824.95s -> 7830.55s]  I don't think Max would like me sticking his head there. No no not like not like shove your head
[7830.55s -> 7838.47s]  down his pants. I'm talking like here. Oh Mr. Culture I have a surprise for you. Really? For me?
[7843.62s -> 7856.38s]  Oh my. Thanks Sam. A little stringy but good. Oh I just remembered I'm supposed to be somewhere.
[7856.38s -> 7866.38s]  Bye Max. I did it. Do I need to release them? I may not show it much but I
[7867.18s -> 7877.06s]  washed my car. How do I get the tv off? I can't shoot the tv now. Can I shoot the tv now that his
[7877.06s -> 7896.49s]  his brain is gone? I think I've done. This smoke is the only thing that's interactable I think
[7896.49s -> 7907.06s]  still. What the hand? I want strange. Is there a plug? I wonder what would happen to the picture
[7907.14s -> 7912.34s]  quality if I gave this a tug. This is essentially pulling the plug. I must be on tv for all eternity.
[7916.12s -> 7926.55s]  Oh yes that's much better reception. You got it. Oh no he's awake. What done for? Save the girlish
[7926.55s -> 7932.47s]  histrionics Bosco. I'm all right. I was merely the victim of your garden variety video delivery.
[7932.47s -> 7938.39s]  TV finally has a use. But what about your co-conspirator? My co-conspirator? Holy underpants
[7938.47s -> 7942.95s]  draped to the mast of a sinking pork rind freighter. That hirsuteeumaniac kidnapped
[7942.95s -> 7951.42s]  my little buddy. Why is Sam Robin from the 60s Batman? Lightning Rider just gave five community
[7951.42s -> 7964.30s]  subs. Thank you for the five subs. Coming in with five. Any community subs? Thank you.
[7964.94s -> 7971.90s]  Brady Coulter? I bow man. Stay away from him. He's got it in for me. Sorry Bosco. No can do. I've got
[7971.90s -> 7977.96s]  to save my free little pal. Can you help me? I don't suppose you have a Bosco tech device
[7977.96s -> 7983.56s]  that stymies hypnosis inducing energy beams. A hypnosis blocker? I thought about making one of
[7983.56s -> 7992.07s]  those but I would even know where to begin. I've got to find something quick. Bye Bosco. Do me proud.
[7992.95s -> 8002.39s]  There's no time for that. No don't take the cheese. Can I just go walk back in the front door?
[8003.11s -> 8018.36s]  Do I have a car? No my car is gone right? Technically. Yeah I guess I drove back.
[8020.82s -> 8025.30s]  How did I drive the car back? I'm not going back to that asylum until I've got a working defense
[8025.30s -> 8031.06s]  against that dastardly hypnotist. Okay what about over here? Maybe Sybil will give me something.
[8031.06s -> 8043.14s]  Speaking of community subs. Ert thank you. Ert for the five community subs. Ert 110 thank you.
[8047.69s -> 8056.09s]  Doc Max is gone. Well most of us outgrow our imaginary friends eventually. No that
[8056.09s -> 8062.65s]  megalomaniac Brady cultures got him. I see of course. How do you get picked for a community sub?
[8063.53s -> 8072.86s]  I think it's just random. It randomly just picks a non-sub in the chat and they get it. Hang on.
[8072.86s -> 8078.86s]  Were you implying that Max is imaginary? I wasn't implying anything though he does seem a little
[8078.86s -> 8086.81s]  improbable. But you have to do it singularly. But then I'm a psychotherapist. I forgot to find
[8086.81s -> 8092.34s]  some way to block a hypnotic ray. I don't suppose you as a brain specialist of sorts would know
[8092.34s -> 8097.94s]  anything. I've been monitoring people for months to choose who to pick. Great suffering. Oh really?
[8097.94s -> 8103.38s]  You do know something. Oh there you go. Before my synapses fuse into a milky puddle of swine.
[8103.38s -> 8109.14s]  Speaking of subs. Brody and thanks for the five community subs. Brody weapon. Thank you.
[8109.22s -> 8114.50s]  But one of my more technologically inclined patients drew me a diagram of a contraption
[8114.50s -> 8120.58s]  he claimed will block hypnosis. That's just the sort of ridiculously lucky break I need.
[8120.58s -> 8126.50s]  It's a huge violation of every reasonable code of ethical conduct of course. But you being a
[8126.50s -> 8132.58s]  policeman of sorts. I suppose it's okay to give you the diagram. My lack of solid engineering
[8132.58s -> 8137.94s]  background has finally caught up with me. I can't make any sense of this. I'd love to help but
[8137.94s -> 8145.02s]  engineering is one of the few fields I haven't tried. Sorry. Engineering. Okay.
[8146.06s -> 8150.94s]  Hey pilot guy. Five more community subs from pilot guy. Five more community subs from
[8150.94s -> 8160.95s]  German lied about Minecraft VR. Drossophilia five community subs. Now here comes the the rollout of
[8160.95s -> 8172.50s]  gifted subs. Thank you guys. I'm gonna go give this to Bosco. It's not that way. Oh Jesus.
[8173.67s -> 8180.23s]  Five. I can't. They're coming out too fast. Gnarly thanks for the five community subs.
[8180.23s -> 8201.48s]  Peek of banana five. Pixel Mike five. Drossophilia five. It's a lot. Thank you guys. What a generous
[8201.48s -> 8219.59s]  bunch of people. Even more coming in. Flug boy. Gnarly. Did Gnarly give another five?
[8220.31s -> 8231.96s]  Flug boy with five. Who now isn't a sub? Everybody's a sub at this point. Thank you guys.
[8233.13s -> 8241.26s]  That won't help me. Can you make something out of this? Bosco take a gander at this. Thank you
[8241.26s -> 8245.66s]  Kyratopia for the five even nice subs. It's instructions for the latest in Bosco tech
[8245.66s -> 8252.94s]  innovation. Buy from Kyratopia. Yeah I can build this. Just need one thing. What's that? Something
[8252.94s -> 8258.33s]  for that antenna thing at the top. Antenna. Got it. Didn't I just didn't already pick it up?
[8262.30s -> 8282.65s]  Go get the antenna from the tv. Sorry I had to new. I sneezed. I had to sneeze.
[8283.53s -> 8288.14s]  Shadows one. Disciple. Thank you for the five community subs.
[8292.01s -> 8302.12s]  One Mystica. Thanks for the five community subs. Thank you guys. More subs rolling in.
[8302.12s -> 8305.61s]  A fucking shitload. That's like 50. More.
[8306.41s -> 8317.90s]  Max isn't gonna like it when he finds out I ruined our reception.
[8317.90s -> 8334.81s]  I've got to tell him as soon as possible. Wholesome chat. Generous chat. I got a sub. I'm a lurker.
[8335.45s -> 8357.58s]  I'm glad you got it. Let's go back. Give him the cone hanger so he can fix this. Finish it. Another
[8357.58s -> 8366.31s]  five from Adventure MF Dan. Five community subs. Will a make-do antenna do as a make-do antenna?
[8366.31s -> 8371.83s]  Yeah okay. Let me just add a little Bosco tech innovation. Thank you. Here it is. The most
[8371.83s -> 8376.63s]  sophisticated hypnosis blocking helmet the world has ever seen. You guys are too much. Thank you
[8376.63s -> 8381.35s]  guys. Happy days are here again. Uh oh seems like the old moolah gauge is running on empty.
[8381.35s -> 8388.39s]  I take it. Just stop that bread culture. He's got it in for me. You're a credit to dementia Bosco.
[8388.39s -> 8395.40s]  You'll have to pay for the next one though. To wear this thing. I'll put it on inside
[8396.04s -> 8409.26s]  this neighborhood. Sounds good. What is it? Food review? What food should I review? I don't have
[8409.26s -> 8419.02s]  any food to review. I've been a sub for five years and all I got was this lousy streamer.
[8420.89s -> 8435.80s]  That's actually a pretty... That would be a funny shirt. It would be. Let's get in here. Put on the
[8435.80s -> 8440.52s]  helmet. Rule number three. Always wear protective headgear when confronting diabolical villains
[8440.52s -> 8450.09s]  with hypnotic devices. Still waiting for that clown car. When's he gonna get in the clown car?
[8450.09s -> 8455.77s]  Hand over the lagomorph culture. Sam! Boy am I glad to see you. Johann Sebastian here only knows
[8455.77s -> 8462.89s]  how to play one song. What's this? A rerun? Didn't we just see the dog getting hypnotized episode?
[8463.53s -> 8465.61s]  Well if you really want to watch it again.
[8469.14s -> 8473.38s]  What? Back into him. Another triumph for skanky ingenuity and ordinary kitchenware.
[8473.46s -> 8480.34s]  Give it up culture. Your quiche is cooked. Time out for the cavalry. You colored outside the lines
[8480.34s -> 8488.42s]  of the law Brady culture. We see you and this time we're going to get hypnotized again.
[8491.14s -> 8497.94s]  Why didn't I have headgear for them? I should have made three of them. So now my foolish pawns. Attack
[8497.94s -> 8511.53s]  the dog. That doesn't need it. Attack the dog.
[8516.60s -> 8525.21s]  Attack the dog. Well there's videos over there. Television.
[8527.67s -> 8534.20s]  They have no gun. Boxing glove. Can I like give them tape to fight over?
[8534.76s -> 8539.08s]  It's a stack of those libo videos.
[8543.82s -> 8557.02s]  Don't think that. Hey culture have you ever watched your own video tape? Of course not.
[8557.02s -> 8574.06s]  I'm not an idiot. What? Why? Why did that happen? It's a stack of those libo videos.
[8577.50s -> 8583.10s]  Attack the dog. Okay so then they attack. I pull up the glove. They stop. I don't know I want to
[8583.98s -> 8603.37s]  open the inventory. Attack the videotapes.
[8617.90s -> 8628.74s]  Attack the videotapes. That's a good idea. Attack Brady culture. No attack the dog. Hey what?
[8628.74s -> 8649.93s]  What? Become what? Become me. Summer assaulting democrats in a crate of sauerkraut.
[8649.93s -> 8656.17s]  Patience is a sharp razor to swallow. You crack me up little buddy. Who's that supposed to be?
[8657.29s -> 8660.01s]  Attack the dog. Attack the dog.
[8660.01s -> 8675.10s]  This is a good turn-based video game. All right so become yourselves right?
[8675.90s -> 8694.55s]  Become Brady culture. Become become videotapes. Become videotapes. Black wits. Attack the dog.
[8695.27s -> 8695.99s]  Ouch.
[8706.94s -> 8716.79s]  Attack yourselves. Attack yourselves.
[8724.63s -> 8735.75s]  Attack Brady culture. No attack. Ouch. You okay little buddy? How are you doing up there?
[8735.83s -> 8740.39s]  Adversary with gory high school poems while he plays that dumb song over and over.
[8740.39s -> 8748.26s]  Hey that's my theme song. Well I mean there's the videotapes.
[8751.14s -> 8770.34s]  Become yourselves. Become yourselves. Attack the dog. Attack me.
[8771.14s -> 8779.02s]  Whoops. Ouch. Attack the dog.
[8787.37s -> 8800.17s]  Become Brady culture. Do my evil bidding. Worship the videotape. Attack the dog. Attack the dog.
[8800.89s -> 8807.19s]  Attack the dog. I can't move. Telev- can I attack the tv?
[8807.19s -> 8811.75s]  Every bed's got its own tv. I feel like making a bad pun about Brady's order.
[8822.39s -> 8833.32s]  Wait wait wait wait wait. Where did worship come from? Worship? Worship wasn't here before.
[8834.87s -> 8849.72s]  Worship me. No. Worship me you minions. Mine. It's a step. Attack the dog.
[8850.52s -> 8863.82s]  Ouch. Where was worship before? Worship me. No me me. Worship me. Everything is about me.
[8868.68s -> 8886.87s]  Me me me. I don't think that would be interested enough. I don't think. Attack me. No me. Attack
[8886.87s -> 8896.71s]  me. Me me me. Yes. No wait I mean. We had to actually do Daffy Duck. Remember I told
[8896.71s -> 8900.31s]  you that before with the very beginning. We had to play like it was a cartoon. I tried to send
[8900.31s -> 8904.95s]  you semaphore signals with my ears but you know how I always get the K and the V mixed up.
[8904.95s -> 8911.14s]  You crack me up little buddy. Well I guess we should de-hypnotize these poor saps again and
[8911.22s -> 8916.82s]  be on our way. Let me. You know how I adork gratuitous violence. Caffeine rock.
[8922.07s -> 8927.51s]  Well that's that Max. You didn't break them the lenses just came out. You have to melt those
[8927.51s -> 8932.15s]  lenses down. The blind control thing didn't go any further. That could have been really annoying.
[8933.13s -> 8939.05s]  It's great to be on your show Myra. I'm a huge fan. I just can't seem to stop watching for some
[8939.05s -> 8970.58s]  reason. Hey Salmon Max. Episode two or Dragon. What do you think? Episode two? What do you think?
[8986.30s -> 8992.22s]  Personality test? Double do that? That'll be a whole screen.
[8992.38s -> 8998.87s]  All right let's take a good pee break. We'll bring it back. We'll do episode two.
[8999.75s -> 9004.68s]  They're all like two two and a half hours so that's a good time.
[9015.83s -> 9024.74s]  Now we're gonna do season one episode two. That drunk guy at car tape not killing us.
[9025.78s -> 9032.98s]  What? Who is that? Is that somebody in Mr. Credits? That was somebody's job description?
[9033.70s -> 9056.71s]  Oh special thanks I see. Well that's episode one. I'm gonna save it. Oh well I already beat it so
[9056.71s -> 9063.35s]  it don't matter. Episode two is its own separate game so we're gonna open it. I'll be right back.
[9064.07s -> 9346.87s]  Gonna grab a water. Gonna pee. Be back in like two three minutes. See you real soon. Okay let's
[9346.87s -> 9363.61s]  quit out of this and open up episode two. But I also want to make this clear. Make sure everyone
[9363.61s -> 9376.33s]  knows it's existing. That after today you are not going to see me for a week. I'm out. I'm out of
[9376.33s -> 9390.79s]  here. I will be back around this time next weekend. I'm going on a mom vacation. I will not be around.
[9390.79s -> 9402.60s]  Just make sure everybody knows. Talked about it a bunch but want to make sure nobody misses it.
[9402.60s -> 9410.94s]  It's gonna be the title of my stream for a week. Is it gonna be mom is here. See you next week.
[9410.94s -> 9424.81s]  Jerma's average dong comes in with 10 community subs. Thank you for the 10 community subs.
[9424.81s -> 9431.03s]  Jerma's average dong. I gotta mute this because it's probably gonna be pretty loud. What's episode
[9431.03s -> 9445.34s]  two called? Situation comedy is episode two. Interesting. Are they all like two two and a half
[9445.34s -> 9452.90s]  hours long or is it one of those scenarios where because it seems like each one is its own game.
[9452.90s -> 9472.82s]  Okay five more community subs from Freudian Weapon. Thank you Freudian. Thank you all of you.
[9473.46s -> 9490.34s]  Listen how loud this is. You can hear that shit but this is the gym playlist. I had to take them
[9490.34s -> 9503.43s]  out. Headphones are out. More community subs from Jerma's average dong. Oh my god. Thank you. Ten
[9503.43s -> 9511.03s]  more. Uh why is it just skipping right to this? No I gotta hold on. I gotta get to the menu.
[9516.30s -> 9519.98s]  More community subs. Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. Five more community subs.
[9524.68s -> 9534.34s]  You guys. Somebody get that phone. Oh wow a 15 sub dong. Okay here we go. I'm gonna have to restart
[9534.34s -> 9548.82s]  it. The resolution's all wrong. It's all wrong. All right that's better. Uh gotta turn full screen
[9548.82s -> 9557.66s]  off because I cannot capture it otherwise it'll lag. Apply the resolution and let's cap the
[9557.66s -> 9574.46s]  screen. What do you say? Let's get this over with huh. There we are. Okay new game. Yes I do want to
[9574.46s -> 9598.28s]  make a new game. All right let's do episode two. This is cool though. It's fun just to sit and play
[9598.28s -> 9609.59s]  and hang out. I said this yesterday but it's kind of been a while since we've just relaxed and played
[9609.59s -> 9616.94s]  a game together. Just watched and hung out. Talked about stuff. It's good to do it. We did it
[9616.94s -> 9624.52s]  yesterday. Ten more community subs from my average dong. Jerma's average dong. That that's
[9625.96s -> 9643.21s]  10, 20, 30 plus community subs. Thank you so much. I'm gonna duel to start this one. I remember
[9643.21s -> 9652.23s]  that gun. That thing was worth a lot of money too. Yes that's the what's it called? The Lugamore
[9652.23s -> 9657.03s]  print. Yep.
[9675.27s -> 9676.63s]  Oh isn't that a hypnosis thing?
[9684.63s -> 9689.75s]  Gifts against their collective will. I don't normally endorse the use of the word dastardly
[9689.75s -> 9694.71s]  but this is clearly dastardly. Pretty refined for a Lugamore. We've got to drive over to the station
[9694.71s -> 9699.35s]  right away. We're at our earliest convenience. Great I've been itching to bust some skulls since
[9699.35s -> 9709.88s]  they cancelled my so-called life. The voice actor changed? Why? The other voice actor did episode one
[9710.60s -> 9720.01s]  and that's it. More dong. Ten more dongs. Thank you so much for the ten community subs.
[9722.49s -> 9732.14s]  Not so average anymore. Not such an average dong. Local streamer gets rich off own genitals.
[9732.86s -> 9738.18s]  But yeah if you're taking off I know it's late. I started really late.
[9743.70s -> 9746.66s]  But we're gonna go for a little longer. We'll do episode two. We'll chill.
[9747.62s -> 9756.46s]  We'll probably go pretty late. So if it's uh I know I started at like seven o'clock
[9756.46s -> 9761.16s]  pacific but I did want to go live today because I knew I wasn't going to be live for a while. So
[9761.16s -> 9765.42s]  if you're going to take off see you soon. See you next week. The sauce will be set to the day
[9766.47s -> 9771.32s]  and me and my mother will have a good time. But for people that are sticking around
[9771.32s -> 9783.30s]  we'll go I'm assuming past midnight tonight pacific at least. Sam and Max 2. Here we go.
[9783.30s -> 9790.04s]  Myra stump holding her audience hostage. You watch that particular bit of daytime fluff occasionally
[9790.04s -> 9795.72s]  don't you Max? Whenever our tv's out of hot for some reason I can't get enough of her sharp tooth
[9795.72s -> 9803.98s]  maternal ranting. Holy shit. Jerma's average dong. Jerma average dong is trying to reach
[9803.98s -> 9814.74s]  Jerma's massive dong status. More community subs. You're a lovable but essentially useless lump of
[9814.82s -> 9820.34s]  Thank you for 10 more. Oh my god. On the contrary I can be a vital source of alternative insight
[9820.34s -> 9825.86s]  into the problems that plague you. Well there's that. I am the massive dong.
[9827.78s -> 9830.34s]  Oh god they're the same person.
[9834.63s -> 9840.10s]  This is all secret plot for me to talk about my dong. Why do you suppose Myra's got her
[9840.10s -> 9845.30s]  audience captive? Who knows? Last month Charles Groton put his hand on her desk and she hit it
[9845.30s -> 9854.95s]  with a ruler. She's very strict. It's incredibly generous though. It really is. Let's get going.
[9854.95s -> 9865.13s]  You lead and I'll follow hack hat. They're all the same person. It leads back to me now. Seriously
[9865.13s -> 9872.66s]  whoever you are thank you. It's a lot of money. All right so it's the same town same people same
[9872.66s -> 9881.69s]  things just new adversary. What is it? She's in the closet still? Nope. Oh it's the hair.
[9881.69s -> 9888.25s]  It makes for an unwieldy but oh so enchanting memento of our first case in a long while.
[9888.89s -> 9902.89s]  He howled like a sick wallaby when I shaved it off him. Quick times. It's the hair. More
[9903.61s -> 9913.14s]  more subs. The dong money laundering scheme continues. 10 more. 90 subs already.
[9914.10s -> 9931.75s]  What? Oh my god. Let's go. Let's take a let's take a walk over here. Newspaper. Newspaper.
[9931.75s -> 9937.35s]  Brady culture behind bars. He finally found a way to become famous. The police plotter.
[9940.39s -> 9949.34s]  Alien love triangle times. Looks like they're sold out. How do you report dick money to the IRS?
[9950.14s -> 9964.39s]  Takes me back to my childhood. Oh my god. Bringing Jerma up to a higher tax bracket.
[9969.03s -> 9974.15s]  And don't forget about Adventure Dan with five more community subs. Thank you. Not really.
[9974.95s -> 9984.63s]  It's me Bosco. What's with the planet ship strainer Bosco? Bosco? I know not that moniker.
[9985.27s -> 9993.43s]  I am Lord Reginald Rumplebottom. Earl of Dukedom. Sam what language is he speaking?
[9993.43s -> 10001.91s]  I'm not sure Max but I think it might be English. Local streamer writes off penis on tax form as a
[10001.91s -> 10016.55s]  dependent. Imagine trying to pulse him. I mean that what would you okay if you were at the IRS
[10016.55s -> 10028.47s]  and you saw that what'd you do? Would you laugh or would you be like annoyed? I'm not sure. No
[10028.47s -> 10033.27s]  really what made you convert to British? It's because everybody's got an end for me that's why.
[10033.91s -> 10039.59s]  Yeah we heard. I had to get a disguise to throw them off the trail. Oh they'll never find me now.
[10040.15s -> 10043.83s]  They wouldn't even know where to begin to look. Clever clogs.
[10047.30s -> 10050.98s]  All right so what what's the problem? The forces of evil are bedeviling you this time.
[10050.98s -> 10057.30s]  It's the skin bodies man they're after me. Skin bodies? Sounds like a pack of belligerent nudists.
[10057.30s -> 10063.38s]  Oh no the skin bodies are like skinheads but ten times worse. Sure they're not a hundred times worse?
[10063.94s -> 10074.15s]  Yeah maybe a hundred times maybe a million. Um these skin bodies what exactly are they doing to
[10074.15s -> 10082.95s]  you? They're stealing my I mean pinching my shaving cream. Of all the things of yours they could pinch
[10082.95s -> 10089.03s]  why the shaving cream? So they can shave their bodies of course. Of course they shave their
[10089.03s -> 10094.12s]  whole bodies. Yeah what happened to your security? Not to be rude but why? You're the best in the
[10094.12s -> 10099.08s]  world. Best security in the world. Stopping these skin bodies. Well after the whole video delivery
[10099.08s -> 10103.72s]  conspiracy I figured I better build something to keep people from bringing stuff into my store.
[10104.60s -> 10109.48s]  So? So I needed to borrow some of the high tech detecting parts from BTEC.
[10110.44s -> 10114.04s]  Meaning nothing's stopping people from taking stuff out of the store anymore.
[10114.52s -> 10123.51s]  Dash it all. I knew I forgot something. More dong subs. Where I think we're at over a hundred.
[10124.23s -> 10134.36s]  What did you say those skin bodies were doing? They're pinching my shaving cream. Thank you so
[10134.36s -> 10145.62s]  much Jerma's average dong. Hundred dongs. Too many dongs. Thanks Bosco.
[10147.70s -> 10151.56s]  Please don't ban me. I'm not gonna ban you.
[10152.20s -> 10167.14s]  Oh it's knackered. Ketchup, mustard, and purple stuff. As vaguely referred to on TV.
[10168.18s -> 10176.97s]  Too many dongs too little time. All right shaving cream. Is this it? Whipped liverwurst. Absolutely
[10176.97s -> 10189.27s]  not. Whipped liverwurst? That's fucking gross. So yeah I can take the shaving cream. I could use a
[10189.27s -> 10198.92s]  shave. I'll say your five o'clock shadow goes clear to your ankles. Pig, dog, pig dog. The
[10198.92s -> 10208.92s]  skin bodies rule the streets. Why are they shooting the gun in here? The little did it again after
[10208.92s -> 10219.00s]  him. I mean. They just. All right that was insane. Speaking of insane. We had 10 more coming right
[10219.00s -> 10232.44s]  there. Holy shit. Let's do some shopping. Great. Did I put the volume too low? You crack me up
[10232.44s -> 10247.51s]  little buddy. I think that's all right. We gotta chase down those hairless rats. Oh wait what about
[10247.51s -> 10261.02s]  buying things? It's for your vacation. Oh I appreciate that. Hey Bosco. This was in the rat movie. We've got skin
[10261.02s -> 10267.90s]  bodies to chase Sam. Wait wait what? No. Hey Bosco. The law enforcement here in the states
[10267.90s -> 10287.69s]  really is pathetic. We've got. I can't. I have to go. Is that them? All right well their car probably
[10287.69s -> 10296.39s]  is very very slow. I get in my car. What can I just grab them when they drive by? Where are we going
[10296.47s -> 10311.19s]  Sam? Extra dongs. 10 more dongs. After those rats. It's not an average dong anymore. It's it's too
[10311.19s -> 10318.42s]  it's too big. No I just said that. No but listen. It's a lot of money. I just hope that you're
[10318.42s -> 10324.42s]  financially able to. How do those rapidly small wheels move so fast? That's too many dongs.
[10324.74s -> 10357.02s]  The skin buddy. Try to drive him into something.
[10369.26s -> 10381.77s]  That was a bad grandpa Simpson but it's very loud. Okay hold on tight little buddy.
[10387.10s -> 10393.08s]  That's a good that was a pretty good take on that one. All right so what the hell why
[10393.08s -> 10412.31s]  what's what's the deal with that? Can I now go back in here? They rule these streets.
[10414.38s -> 10417.58s]  Took care of your rat problem now sir. Sell me some cheese.
[10421.48s -> 10432.58s]  We want to buy something. Yes quite so quite so. What have you got? Well just between us I have a
[10432.58s -> 10439.54s]  most peculiar device. Is this going to be another tear gas? What peculiar device are you so eager to
[10439.54s -> 10445.94s]  pawn off on us this time? It's the latest in Bosco tech innovation. A delightful invention I like to
[10445.94s -> 10452.42s]  call a chemical based voice modulator. Voice modulator? What's that? I do believe it's
[10452.42s -> 10458.02s]  self-explanatory. We don't really have time to explain it to ourselves. Why don't you just
[10458.02s -> 10465.14s]  explain it to us? Well it alters the frequency of your voice molecules. Very useful very useful.
[10466.10s -> 10471.69s]  Can we just have it or is it 10 grand? We'd like that. Is everything 10 grand in this game?
[10471.69s -> 10477.37s]  That will be 30 shillings. Yeah I left our shillings in my other pants. How much in dollars?
[10478.01s -> 10486.81s]  Let's see here 30 shillings would be about one million American dollars. A million dollars? No
[10486.81s -> 10491.77s]  way are we giving out that many tickets. I think we'll have to find an entirely new revenue stream
[10491.77s -> 10500.01s]  if we want that voice modulator. Worth every shilling trust me trust me. Okay so no let's
[10500.01s -> 10505.05s]  do that again. We'd like that. That will be. We'll be back later once we find out. Now we need to
[10505.05s -> 10514.70s]  become millionaires. Nothing for us. What does this do? Hands in the air Bosco. You're coming with
[10514.70s -> 10521.34s]  us. Good heavens. We're taking you in for masquerading as a man of class and distinction.
[10521.34s -> 10528.38s]  What the devil? Surely you jest. Yes surely we do. On the bright side now you can add the police to
[10528.38s -> 10536.04s]  your long list of paranoia induced nightmare subjects. Piss off. See you later Bosco. Thanks
[10536.04s -> 10551.51s]  Bosco. Hello sir. There's another option? We want to buy something. Oh is it different this time?
[10552.31s -> 10559.72s]  Do you have any complimentary fresh garlic? No. Do you have any fine leather jackets?
[10560.36s -> 10569.56s]  No. It's different every time. Do you have any gumballs the size of your head? No. Do you have
[10569.56s -> 10578.68s]  any plus two plate armor of limitless squeeze ability? No. Do you have any pes dispensers with
[10578.68s -> 10589.00s]  the head of infamous Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa? No. Do you have any ketchup? No. Oh wait.
[10589.00s -> 10600.04s]  Got you. Blast. Drank. Dash it all. Can I have it? Nothing for us right. Let's go back the other way.
[10600.04s -> 10618.39s]  How's the uh the psychoanalyst doing? Thanks Bosco. Bombs? Rope? Lamboil? It's all yours friend
[10618.39s -> 10641.51s]  as long as you have enough rupees. That's an old one. Isn't it beautiful? Garden. Those are old.
[10642.15s -> 10654.20s]  That's seriously one of my first experiences with memology. You know what I mean? Sam, Max,
[10654.20s -> 10659.40s]  how nice to see you. I don't suppose you have any candid photos of little green men feeling
[10659.40s -> 10668.73s]  frisky do you? What? What? It's my new career. I'm a tabloid publisher specializing in the thoughtful
[10668.73s -> 10673.93s]  analysis of groundbreaking news of interest to myself and others like me. What's it called?
[10673.93s -> 10682.01s]  She's going to change careers every episode. So you're a publisher now? What happened to
[10682.01s -> 10686.81s]  psychotherapy? I've always had a fascination with the suppressed and the sensual and for telling
[10686.81s -> 10692.09s]  people too much about both. Publishing the alien love triangle times is a logical extension of
[10692.09s -> 10701.21s]  all my previous careers except maybe Vatican spokesperson. You don't do psychotherapy anymore.
[10701.21s -> 10707.13s]  Are you doing any psychotherapy on the side? Only on space aliens. I guess that narrows your clientele
[10707.13s -> 10715.40s]  quite a bit. No not really. What was it you said about a photo? My new tabloid the alien love
[10715.40s -> 10720.92s]  triangle times needs a cover photo of an extraterrestrial biological entity or alien
[10720.92s -> 10725.40s]  as the unwashed masses calls them caught getting cozy with some of the locals.
[10726.36s -> 10730.60s]  Sybil I'd like the record to show that although I support you as a friend your latest project
[10730.60s -> 10740.42s]  makes my skin decidedly crawly. Me too. I like that tie. I like that tie. I want this tie as a shirt.
[10743.40s -> 10754.47s]  I'd wear it. Psychoanalyze me again. Quick analysis for old times sake. Oh all right think of a number
[10754.47s -> 10762.38s]  between one and four. Two. Two. You're selectively audio-averse. I don't like the sound of that.
[10767.38s -> 10770.58s]  All right what about what do you need? So you're looking for a cover photo of little green men
[10770.58s -> 10776.42s]  canoodling right? Yeah though I'm kind of desperate at this point. Basically I can use anything as
[10776.42s -> 10781.22s]  long as there are three beings in the shot and at least one of them's an alien. It is the alien
[10781.22s -> 10784.74s]  love triangle times after all. So I need three people in a picture and one's gonna be an alien.
[10786.78s -> 10793.10s]  There's nothing like good hard-nosed journalism. You said it it's time to find out the real answers
[10793.10s -> 10800.70s]  to the real questions. Like what did those poor cattle do to deserve that? No what do aliens do
[10800.70s -> 10808.06s]  for romance? Do they love? How do they get their otherworldly thrills? By playing slots in Keno?
[10808.06s -> 10816.82s]  That'd explain why they're always seen in Nevada. No you got me woke up. He said fuck Keno. Keno
[10816.82s -> 10823.99s]  sucks. Have you learned anything interesting since you started this uh magazine? I learned why Elvis
[10823.99s -> 10831.27s]  had such an otherworldly voice. Elvis was not an alien. Sure he was. He just wore makeup to cover
[10831.75s -> 10836.87s]  his emerald green skin. Frankly Sybil, this project is disturbing as well as distressingly
[10836.87s -> 10842.55s]  intimate. Like seeing Stephen King getting a hot butter massage. Is that the first thing you've
[10842.55s -> 10860.02s]  written on stream? Who else is an alien? Is anybody else an alien that we might not know about? Dr.
[10860.02s -> 10870.15s]  Phil. Well that goes without saying. I can see that. That makes sense. Dr. Phil really does come
[10870.23s -> 10875.35s]  off as the kind of guy that after the show. And that's the whole thing. See you next time
[10875.35s -> 10879.83s]  when we analyze someone else. Get out of here. Get out of here. You're a you're a dumb idiot.
[10879.83s -> 10886.95s]  Get out of here. And he goes backstage and like his skin just fucking falls off of him. He like
[10886.95s -> 10902.74s]  gets in a bath. An alien bath. I can see it. In fact if I had to name you like 10 people that I
[10902.74s -> 10914.76s]  think might be an alien. Dr. Phil would be in number eight. I think. This is they knew what
[10914.76s -> 10921.94s]  they were doing. What's in an alien bath? It's a regular bath except there's an alien in it this
[10921.94s -> 10933.85s]  time. And they add like other like spices in it and shit. We'll be back. Keep watching the supplies.
[10938.34s -> 10947.05s]  There's like the coriander and like cumin and fucking like cilantro. Now let's look at some of
[10947.05s -> 10952.17s]  this stuff. She's got a story here about two hygienists from Walla Walla and an amorphous
[10952.17s -> 10956.65s]  saturnian slime mold. There's like oregano in it. Is that the one where they walk into a bar? Tabasco
[10956.65s -> 10961.29s]  sauce and shit. They put like all kinds of weird stuff in it. That's not even weird. That stuff's
[10961.29s -> 10970.09s]  like good. What am I talking about? A mima graph. I love cilantro. Yeah I do. It's so good.
[10971.29s -> 10981.96s]  Okay so we need a picture. What's my mayonnaise? Nothing useful in here.
[10984.98s -> 10988.90s]  This is not the exit. God damn it. I do it every time.
[10992.02s -> 10998.66s]  Nice cactus. Saguaro. Vinyl. Hey if you dip that in ink you could do 30 tattoos at once.
[11000.90s -> 11008.57s]  Cilantro just tastes like I'm eating grass and chemicals. Yeah only us aliens know what it tastes.
[11008.57s -> 11026.31s]  You have to be an alien to like cilantro. It's kind of weird because cilantro,
[11026.95s -> 11032.39s]  the way cilantro smells, I don't want it near me. It's kind of like the way that I think a mosquito
[11032.39s -> 11039.82s]  feels when you have off on your body. If cilantro comes near me I'm like no get that away. I don't
[11039.82s -> 11052.20s]  want it. I don't want to near me but I like it. I like the way it tastes. No there's actually new
[11052.20s -> 11057.16s]  gumballs in here. Looks like candy but I'm pretty sure it's fish tank gravel again. I've had worse.
[11057.16s -> 11063.48s]  Yeah cilantro smells like a mosquito feels when they're approaching somebody with off on their
[11063.48s -> 11069.21s]  body. You know you can just sense something that something's wrong and you just don't want to be
[11069.21s -> 11077.62s]  near it. There is people repellent. Off. OFF. Off. You don't know what off is. Off. The spray. The
[11077.62s -> 11087.66s]  mosquito spray. You put it all over your body. Off. OFF. It's the number one name brand mosquito
[11087.66s -> 11098.47s]  repellent in the world probably. You don't use raid on your body. You use off. Off and cilantro
[11098.47s -> 11110.65s]  smell the same. Are you trying to tell us you don't like this? No don't use raid. Raid. Money.
[11111.29s -> 11118.39s]  All right what am I doing? I need a picture. Can I go anywhere to get this? Okay picture. I need a
[11118.39s -> 11131.45s]  photo. A photo of aliens. There was another place over here that I didn't get to see before. Zoomers
[11131.45s -> 11147.16s]  don't use bug spray. What do you mean? What do you do? What do you do instead of bug spray?
[11149.83s -> 11162.60s]  Light a couple of candles? Where are we going Sam? The tv studio. Goodie. You guys do cilantro
[11162.60s -> 11168.04s]  candles? No what's it called? What's this? It's got a certain name. Cilantro candles. They're all the
[11168.04s -> 11173.88s]  same thing. They smell the same. Um citronello. Cilantro. Citrus cilantro. Well here we are Max.
[11173.88s -> 11179.80s]  The tv station with programs too old to be contemporary, too new to be retro, but consistently
[11179.80s -> 11185.88s]  derivative enough to be popular. W-A-R-P. Television's so mindless you can't help but
[11185.88s -> 11192.04s]  watch. I thought citronello was citrus. No it's cilantro. Mysteriously so. Well let's find this
[11192.04s -> 11197.96s]  Myra character and smack some good old-fashioned. Cilantro salmonella. Smack it into her or smack it
[11197.96s -> 11202.36s]  out of her just so long as there's smacking involved. You crack me up little buddy.
[11204.25s -> 11209.30s]  Citrine candles burn into plasma. Don't do that. Be careful.
[11210.02s -> 11225.16s]  Need a broom little buddy? I don't use brooms Sam. I necessitate the use of them. Director's chair.
[11225.16s -> 11230.92s]  Let me sit in that see how it feels. It's got a falling star. Twinkle twinkle little star.
[11230.92s -> 11239.70s]  Feels pretty good. Howl crashing burn. Uh yeah. No no don't make don't make me do it. Don't make me do it.
[11241.72s -> 11256.18s]  No. All right I died. I got it. I'm fine. Stand aside casually a tired stagehand.
[11256.18s -> 11261.94s]  We're Sam and Max. Freelance police. Fight it. Fight it. We've come to save sympathetic hostages from the
[11261.94s -> 11266.82s]  clutches of. Okay I'm gonna stop you right there. Number one I'm not a stagehand. I am the director.
[11266.82s -> 11272.50s]  The director. Number two we're no longer holding the auditions for animal cops with crippling
[11272.50s -> 11277.30s]  mental disabilities and a lust for dance. The director. We're not actors. You got that right.
[11277.30s -> 11281.70s]  I don't think I've ever seen worse acting in my entire life and yes I have seen Keanu Reeves
[11281.70s -> 11288.02s]  performance in Toast the musical. Sam I think my hypersensitive ego may need stroking. Don't look
[11288.02s -> 11297.99s]  at me. Next? Who's next? Uh we're the police. You don't seem to understand. We're highly untrained
[11297.99s -> 11303.67s]  police officers. Look hats off for dedication guys but I'm just not buying the police act.
[11303.67s -> 11312.44s]  I feel so invalidated. Where is it? We're looking for Myra Stump. Myra Stump. Do not mention that
[11312.44s -> 11320.04s]  name in my presence. Which name Myra or Stump? Either and or both. What's your beef with Myra?
[11320.04s -> 11324.92s]  Let's just say Myra and I have creative differences. I'm creative and she isn't.
[11325.48s -> 11336.38s]  I'm sorry what was your question? Um why don't you like you Myra? Why the hate? Look Myra runs her show
[11336.38s -> 11341.74s]  her way and I run every other show my way. If she doesn't want me on her set I could care less.
[11341.74s -> 11347.50s]  You mean you couldn't care less. If you could care less then you do care some which doesn't really.
[11347.50s -> 11352.46s]  No I was right. I could care less because I care even less about what you're saying right now.
[11352.46s -> 11362.41s]  Oh go ahead knucklehead. Knucklehead? What are you doing here anyhow? What am I doing here? I'm
[11362.41s -> 11368.09s]  holding auditions for Midtown Cowboys. What are you doing here? Midtown Cowboys? The critically
[11368.09s -> 11373.05s]  panned but publicly adored sitcom about two cattle ranchers trying to make it in Midtown Manhattan?
[11373.05s -> 11380.17s]  Yes well summarized. You're hiring extras? No I'm hiring the stars. The two main characters went on
[11380.17s -> 11384.41s]  Myra a couple days ago and I haven't heard from them since. I need replacements ASAP.
[11385.29s -> 11391.77s]  Right here. If we could pass one lousy audition sitcom stardom will finally be ours. Rocketing
[11391.77s -> 11396.25s]  to fame for the most insubstantial of reasons. That truly is the American dream.
[11397.85s -> 11401.45s]  Would you like to audition please? Would you like to apply for that instant stardom you promised?
[11402.01s -> 11407.69s]  You want to audition? Well if there were anybody else here I'd tell you to forget it but okay.
[11408.41s -> 11413.29s]  All right what do we do? I'm going to have you play a scene from old Geller.
[11413.29s -> 11418.89s]  Tell me you've seen it. I'm not into horror movies. It's a classic boy gets a dog. I forgot
[11418.89s -> 11423.37s]  to tell you guys this. Boy shoots dog. All right all right all right. I want you to play the boy.
[11423.37s -> 11431.70s]  Yes boy that is so me. And Sam you play the dog. Oh okay Sam. This is a dentist story. I need you
[11431.70s -> 11437.78s]  to act like you've got full-blown rabies understand. What's my motivation? You're a bad
[11437.78s -> 11448.10s]  dog. Now show me rabbit. Um no dig deep. You should be just frothing mad.
[11459.14s -> 11465.62s]  Sorry I'm not hiring a dog who can't even do a simple rapidity scene. I don't know. I was feeling
[11465.62s -> 11469.94s]  rabid. You look pretty disease ridden to me. Come back after you've taken a few thousand acting.
[11469.94s -> 11473.94s]  I was acting rabid. All right well listen hold on this is important anyways.
[11474.82s -> 11482.26s]  So uh I'm at the dentist today right. Sit down. We're going over some stuff. I do some x-rays and
[11482.26s -> 11488.34s]  I'm lying blind back and they have a a tv on the wall. Some dentists do this now. They have
[11488.34s -> 11494.34s]  you know like monitors all in each room. So I'm sitting there and there's Netflix on it.
[11495.94s -> 11500.26s]  And oh okay cool. This is very this is actually a pretty cool idea. You just have can have like tv
[11500.26s -> 11507.06s]  there. Like that's fucking ridiculous. That's really really awesome. So the dentist is just
[11507.06s -> 11509.62s]  like hey man like yeah while you waiting while you're chilling around while you while we're
[11509.62s -> 11512.58s]  doing some stuff you know you can uh just just browse and put on whatever you want.
[11513.30s -> 11520.84s]  I'm like okay cool. And you know how you can see like what people have seen already on Netflix
[11521.48s -> 11528.57s]  and the queue of stuff that has already been watched. One of the last things that was on
[11529.75s -> 11536.39s]  was a bunch of horror movies like Friday the 13th like Freddy. Why the fuck would you ever watch
[11536.95s -> 11540.55s]  Friday the 13th when you were getting dental work? That's that's terrifying.
[11542.46s -> 11547.18s]  It was like at least two or three fucking messed up horror movies. I'm just sitting there going
[11548.14s -> 11553.82s]  imagine lying there and watching like Jason tear somebody in half with like a chainsaw while
[11553.82s -> 11567.43s]  there's a guy in your mouth like with dentist tools. And I don't know if anybody else is like
[11567.43s -> 11573.05s]  this but I have this weird thing where I don't want anyone to know the things that I want to
[11573.05s -> 11581.42s]  watch on tv. Is that weird? I hovered over a show about wine and I didn't want to put it on
[11583.10s -> 11588.81s]  because it was like a wine documentary and I just felt like people are gonna judge my taste or
[11588.81s -> 11594.01s]  something. I'm trying to think of what's the most normal background thing I could possibly put on.
[11595.02s -> 11602.38s]  I'm scrolling through you've got home fiction and then sell it but I'm like that's too normal.
[11602.38s -> 11607.11s]  That's like too weird. Why would I watch that show? I'm like oh how about like a food show?
[11607.11s -> 11611.35s]  Ah those are those are really easy. Just put on like a food documentary about like sushi
[11612.57s -> 11618.09s]  but I why would I watch that while I'm getting my like teeth like looked at? No. I could it was
[11618.09s -> 11621.69s]  freaking me out. I'm just sitting in the chair. I don't know what to put on and then I scrolled
[11621.69s -> 11624.89s]  over like animation. Like what's like is the animated show? No like what if I put on like a
[11624.89s -> 11627.77s]  kid show? I don't want to put on like a kid show. Why are you watching like a kid show?
[11628.49s -> 11634.70s]  Why are you what are you weird? No no I just I don't know what to put on. Maybe that is why
[11634.70s -> 11645.53s]  people put on horror movies. Seriously I was I it was it was crazy but yeah the last thing
[11645.53s -> 11654.68s]  that somebody watched they were trying to get on friday the 13th how it's made but and what okay
[11654.68s -> 11659.72s]  what and then I was thinking how funny it would be if I did if I put on like a dentist documentary
[11661.82s -> 11666.30s]  I'm trying to think of what that'd be funny these are the dentist is like oh yeah go and put on
[11666.30s -> 11670.78s]  whatever you want and I put on like a dentist thing like a dentist show would that be weird
[11670.78s -> 11682.14s]  would they think it was fucking crazy like oh like tooth exam but go to like the app and just type
[11682.14s -> 11691.98s]  in like tooth examinations to see if there's like a tooth exam mini series what's it what is a
[11691.98s -> 11699.86s]  fucking dentist show there is no dentist show I'm just that's a whole nother question first of all

[11710.58s -> 11722.42s]  why is there no big dentist drama there should be
[11725.32s -> 11738.94s]  Sweeney Todd was a dentist no he was a shaver hello again yes can we take another crack at
[11738.94s -> 11743.58s]  that audition but no I thought it was funny that let's take it from the top somebody decided to

[11899.34s -> 11904.30s]  the scaffold is just a prop scaffold from that show about the tv crew that solves crimes around
[11904.30s -> 11908.70s]  the scaffold is here advanced forensics and overly dramatic reenactments come on
[11908.70s -> 11919.30s]  whoever heard of a crime at a tv station i'm getting pretty good at it the barrel haven
[11919.86s -> 11924.58s]  from whence comes this story from whence from whence clearly from a work of unparalleled
[11924.58s -> 11939.24s]  artistic vision and emotional expressiveness no wonder I haven't seen it once used for apples
[11939.32s -> 11948.84s]  now used for derrières sitcom from midtown cowboys midtown cowboys that away
[11949.48s -> 11955.86s]  all right people let's get the stage set up celebrity hosts will be here any minute

[11985.13s -> 11991.29s]  hectic here doesn't bother us a bit sam and max consummate professional actors reporting for duty
[11992.49s -> 11998.57s]  you said duty sam I knew you guys were right for this show speaking of which could you perhaps
[11998.57s -> 12003.53s]  explain the show a bit okay here's the drill on midtown cowboy you play a pair of cattle ranchers
[12003.53s -> 12009.61s]  trying to raise a herd in an apartment in manhattan my uncle Ernie did that except it was pigs and not
[12009.61s -> 12016.33s]  in an apartment I only see one cow it's a small herd you're struggling okay okay all right you've
[12016.33s -> 12022.33s]  got this landlord mr federally who has a very strict no cows policy devilishly inconvenient
[12022.33s -> 12027.85s]  I begin to see from whence the hilarity sprouts yes federally is always barging in and you try
[12027.85s -> 12031.53s]  to hide the fact that you have a cow in the apartment lots of side gags usually something
[12031.53s -> 12037.69s]  gross winds up happening simple enough great where's the script well there's a slight hitch
[12037.69s -> 12041.29s]  the cow ate most of the script so you're going to have to ad-lib the show perfect
[12041.29s -> 12046.57s]  ad-lib go to doing that yes make it up as you go improvise I can do that yes our regular life
[12046.57s -> 12051.21s]  has given us plenty of practice don't worry you'll be working with philo pennyworth who plays
[12051.21s -> 12055.85s]  federally he's a brilliant actor classically trained globe theater and all that just set
[12055.85s -> 12061.93s]  him up to do something funny and he'll handle it from there check anything else actually yes
[12061.93s -> 12066.01s]  we did save one line from the script and it's really important to work it in because it's the
[12066.01s -> 12070.01s]  product placement that pays for the whole show one of you will have to save the line
[12070.65s -> 12076.89s]  me me pick me all right max your line is this better get the serious toothpaste oh you're
[12076.89s -> 12086.44s]  gonna go to jail i like it already what's mac what what's this show about again there's a lot to

[20467.13s -> 20468.81s]  dogs but they walk around as people
[20472.36s -> 20479.53s]  oh that would be really messed up because then they could go in the fridge they would be able
[20479.53s -> 20484.92s]  to open the fridge and eat they'd get like the mustard out and stuff imagine the dog open up the
[20484.92s -> 20496.28s]  fridge and getting his face in there and just eating like a whole birthday cake still no
[20496.28s -> 20510.98s]  problems that doesn't matter they could just put their hand in and pull where would they eat would
[20510.98s -> 20517.03s]  they would they eat on the ground still or would you have to put would you have to put a plate on
[20517.03s -> 20520.47s]  a table and sit them at the table they sit at the table they stand up and lean down
[20521.27s -> 20529.18s]  but they put you know but usually a dog bowl is on the ground leave the gun take the cannolis

[20600.38s -> 20606.14s]  officially i mean the fact that you've already got your own animal costume shows great initiative

[20935.62s -> 20941.70s]  stress can reduce you to just a bundle of mindless reflexes is that what happened to me wouldn't it
[20941.70s -> 20949.86s]  be wonderful to think so how's it working how's that new profession working out oh sam the life
[20949.86s -> 20955.06s]  of a professional witness isn't all courtroom theatrics and finger pointing the toy mafia
[20955.06s -> 20960.58s]  told me if i testified against them they'd rub me out they tried to buy you off with a swedish
[20960.58s -> 20980.78s]  massage no max i think they meant murder all right time's up it's been 45 minutes it's been 45

[21014.06s -> 21027.88s]  the bits we're gonna hang out so the stream is not over let me save the game yeah this is probably
[21027.88s -> 21037.05s]  a good stopping point we got through the casino we stopped here we got the task uh we'll be back
[21037.05s -> 21042.49s]  we'll be back i know you will you're out oops really she should consider guilt slinger as her
[21042.49s -> 21055.30s]  next profession so sam and max on the stream when i come back from my vacation we'll probably
[21057.32s -> 21062.36s]  we'll pick this back up this might not be the first thing coming back because there's a couple
[21062.36s -> 21069.40s]  things that are really that i would like to do but we're going to finish season one i promise
[21069.40s -> 21075.42s]  guaranteed like we're gonna i want to see how this goes through it might be the first thing
[21075.42s -> 21086.74s]  that happens when we come back it might be a day later we'll see season two is where it gets
[21086.74s -> 21095.22s]  really good i'm all for it i'm all just to hang out and play again i want to start incorporating
[21095.22s -> 21103.46s]  more of these just chill streams when we play a game we dial it up to like a thousand sometimes
[21103.46s -> 21114.06s]  on this stream so it's nice to pull it back a little but uh that is going to be the end of this
[21114.06s -> 21126.92s]  portion i'm going to save it before it gets to be too late we got monster rancher four is another
[21126.92s -> 21136.52s]  one that i have to continue and these are all episodic so it's better this is saved right yeah

[23314.30s -> 23320.90s]  like it i just didn't have a spot to start it you know what i mean it's it's it's hard to

[23340.30s -> 23347.46s]  it's an experience that you let happen on in front of you it's not some you know crazy
[23347.46s -> 23352.42s]  ridiculous thing that i'm going to stream so it's hard to find a place to put it sometimes
[23353.46s -> 23361.85s]  but like i said i want to start to pull in more of these just hanging out and doing something
[23361.85s -> 23368.87s]  streams but it was always hard to place because it always like was either right before or right

[23379.38s -> 23389.85s]  he wouldn't well i played like 40 minutes of episode three but it looks like people that
[23389.85s -> 23396.02s]  you know took this kind of stream well right because i'm always curious of what people think
[23396.02s -> 23400.50s]  or who how many people are going to watch what are they going to say is move on this is boring
[23400.50s -> 23410.62s]  right but i think it was it was great i thought it was great so you'll definitely see it again

[23496.30s -> 23506.10s]  because i when i went into that house i said i wanted to do it it was not the game that i
[23506.10s -> 23510.42s]  thought it was going to be it's a lot more elaborate it's like an investigative game where
[23510.42s -> 23515.86s]  you do like detective work i thought it was just kind of like a courtroom argument simulator but
[23515.86s -> 23521.85s]  that's not what it is it's like a 40 hour long game and i just want to make sure that i don't
[23522.49s -> 23526.73s]  what i don't want to do and i want to stop doing this and i've been i've been all right with it
[23526.73s -> 23534.17s]  recently is starting something that a lot of people want to see and then realize kind of
[23534.17s -> 23538.09s]  20 percent of the way through it that i really don't think i want to do it anymore and then
[23538.09s -> 23544.17s]  don't do it so i really want to start to pick and choose if you're gonna see a game that's on the
[23544.17s -> 23566.95s]  stream we're gonna try to complete it so i want to try to do that more we'll see but thank you

[24529.85s -> 24534.81s]  you could collab you seem like the kind of person who likes to help people that's awesome that
[24534.81s -> 24539.85s]  they're doing that um but i've said the same thing about collaborations i've said in the past
[24540.89s -> 24546.81s]  i they just kind of happen i usually just do my own thing on this platform and on any platform
[24548.26s -> 24552.26s]  collaborations are they just sort of organically will happen with people that i
[24552.26s -> 24556.02s]  just you know randomly talk to or come across or hey is a project that i'd like to do
[24557.43s -> 24566.57s]  i don't really plan out my collaborations but that's pretty awesome that they're doing that
[24574.12s -> 24582.76s]  a lone rat is what he is rat solo for the most part yeah and we've gone over whole
[24582.84s -> 24586.36s]  20 30 minute segments of streams where i've talked about why
[24587.24s -> 24594.89s]  though not to be like a broken record or anything but yeah good for them though that's fucking great
[24596.09s -> 24603.30s]  do a cooking stream summer summer is gonna have so much shit on this channel you have no idea
[24605.06s -> 24609.78s]  summertime is gonna be like this is gonna be so many fucking things that are gonna be streamed
[24610.58s -> 24615.86s]  i can't wait it's gonna be great it's gonna be so much fun

[24626.34s -> 24630.42s]  thanks for the 250 that's what i love about you and vinnie you don't treat us like a business
[24630.42s -> 24639.11s]  opportunity you treat us like family just hanging out playing video games yeah and i mean and look
[24639.11s -> 24649.99s]  when i when i started doing this on youtube and twitch i don't want to i don't care about
[24649.99s -> 24655.91s]  fucking like making a bunch of money that i'm already making a bunch of money you know
[24655.91s -> 24663.70s]  what i mean like i don't care that's not and it doesn't do it for me like i don't like it
[24664.79s -> 24671.11s]  i would rather have people enjoy the streams and want to be part of the community than
[24672.07s -> 24678.47s]  turn everybody into these money churning numbers that i present to fucking companies and present
[24678.47s -> 24684.31s]  to people to make as much money as i possibly can i don't care about that i never have and i
[24684.31s -> 24691.85s]  never will i just it's not i'm just the person that i am i'm not going to say that streaming
[24691.85s -> 24695.53s]  and turning your stream into a business and treating like a business and trying to make a
[24695.53s -> 24705.14s]  bunch of money on your business is is wrong or bad i just did something i don't do because when
[24705.14s -> 24715.22s]  when i used to watch stuff i didn't want to be treated as a viewer as a number that was just
[24715.30s -> 24720.82s]  kind of a way to make somebody money you know i wanted to be like ah this is a place i like to
[24721.46s -> 24727.19s]  watch and hang out and i don't even want you guys to feel like you're being used to make me more
[24727.19s -> 24736.76s]  money and it's not like and i know a lot of people have said that that wouldn't be the case but i
[24736.76s -> 24750.07s]  don't even know where the hell i would start with that br josh yeah he's talked about parasocial
[24750.07s -> 24753.67s]  before it's hard to be sociable with your viewers without some of them thinking that you are their
[24753.67s -> 24757.19s]  friend even though there's no way for a big streamer to really be a friend with all their viewers
[24758.15s -> 24762.39s]  yeah the the way that i've answered that question and talked about that is kind of like what you're
[24762.39s -> 24773.51s]  saying is instead of it being you and i are here and we're friends it's all of us are here it's
[24773.51s -> 24781.51s]  not a you and i scenario it's a collective community of people that all are here and we're
[24781.59s -> 24796.76s]  all around for the same things we are many you are vessel but that's kind of true though you know
[24796.76s -> 24802.17s]  that's kind of the way it is that's the way it kind of should be we are all collectively here
[24803.67s -> 24810.15s]  we are venom we are venom i'm pretty good at that too i've been pretty good at making
[24810.15s -> 24815.10s]  impressions today don't view yourself as a vessel no i mean i know that's a joke but
[24817.77s -> 24826.33s]  i'd rather us collectively enjoy things than have it be a personal one-on-one you and i
[24826.33s -> 24844.92s]  relationship i think it's healthier that way but to put a cap on that conversation no i i treat this
[24844.92s -> 24850.60s]  the same way i treated this when i started making youtube videos let's start with the a b and c a
[24850.60s -> 24860.02s]  do i want to do this today no then i'm not gonna do it i'll see you tomorrow do i want to do this
[24860.02s -> 24863.86s]  today am i like do i have something planned do i have something i want to do do i have something
[24863.86s -> 24874.23s]  fun to try or something yes oh yeah let's go b no no no no i'm not saying like that's the like
[24874.23s -> 24884.50s]  no i'm saying like on a day-to-day basis week-to-week basis it's not like do i do i want to do this no
[24884.50s -> 24894.89s]  not like the whole thing as a whole now you're stuck in abc no it's like do i want to do this
[24894.89s -> 24900.46s]  will i have fun and am i currently having fun while i'm doing it you know i answer that question
[24901.27s -> 24909.16s]  each stream i sit here before stream starts a day the day before day two days before what do i want
[24909.16s -> 24914.44s]  to do what could be fun let's try that do i want to do that yeah all right let's go let's do it
[24923.64s -> 24931.02s]  you sit here for two i sit in the chair for two days i don't move and i just end up falling
[24931.02s -> 24934.54s]  asleep my chin hits my chest and i fucking fall asleep and i wake up screaming
[24936.54s -> 24945.90s]  okay what are we doing yeah sometimes it's like a detriment right like for instance like i built a
[24945.90s -> 24949.74s]  bird house on this stream i just somebody was like wouldn't that be fun it's i don't i'm gonna
[24949.74s -> 24954.86s]  fucking do it i'm gonna do that i don't give a shit well that's what we're doing even if it might
[24954.86s -> 24963.98s]  not be like the best idea if i'd some build a labo while drunk it's just i'm gonna do it nothing else
[24963.98s -> 24972.52s]  is in that equation besides does that sound like fun to me do the ideas land completely every time
[24972.52s -> 24985.22s]  no that doesn't mean i'm gonna stop doing them absolutely not i've been watching the archive my
[24985.22s -> 24996.81s]  first live stream was they was the game referred house stream vr josh thanks a lot man like that
[24997.61s -> 25010.95s]  imagine that's your first drink yeah but that's i will i wanted to be fun because i want to have
[25010.95s -> 25018.47s]  fun too you know it's really it's a symbiotic relationship as a collective unit of people
[25019.48s -> 25024.01s]  because i want to have fun too i want to turn on the stream and i want to do something fun and i
[25024.01s -> 25029.75s]  want to interact and come up with shit and play off you guys what you guys are saying that you guys
[25029.75s -> 25042.57s]  having fun right that's that's why i want that's why i do this let's say yeah we go we go over this
[25042.57s -> 25047.56s]  frequently right because i obviously want to make sure i'm holding up that end of the bargain too
[25048.44s -> 25052.76s]  frequently and we have discussions and talk about hey stay to the channel how things going
[25053.48s -> 25058.57s]  i never wanted to be a bunch of people that are like no this sucks now i don't like it
[25059.59s -> 25063.19s]  i why would i want that i don't want did you say that like for real and i know like
[25063.19s -> 25069.22s]  we're gonna see it right now it's gonna be like oh this sucks right all right i don't but i don't
[25069.22s -> 25074.74s]  want that to be the case and when that gets to be the case that means i'm probably not fucking
[25074.74s -> 25082.17s]  having fun anymore and i'm doing it because i just to do it uh i'm doing because i fucking
[25082.17s -> 25087.85s]  like i have to right no no this i want this to stay just how it is i'm having fun are you having
[25087.85s -> 25098.58s]  fun do we have any interesting things we want to do yeah let's do them and that's the way it is
[25098.58s -> 25102.41s]  that's the way it's going to continue to be because that's the only way that i can stream
[25102.41s -> 25116.39s]  that's it i can't do it i can't do it any other way but we got two more bits to do well one more
[25116.39s -> 25122.31s]  actually but that was tyler mike for 250 and they talked about vinnie too and vinnie has has been a
[25122.31s -> 25129.69s]  at least in this kind of sense um that's been very inspirational to me the way that vinnie treats
[25129.69s -> 25134.25s]  his twitch channel when i was just starting out you know i had a youtube audience i had a large
[25134.25s -> 25138.49s]  youtube audience right we moved over here to twitch and i was i was looking around who's who
[25138.49s -> 25143.29s]  and who's doing what and what are they doing and the whole way vinnie doesn't treat his fans like
[25143.93s -> 25148.01s]  money numbers and doesn't read subs and i'm like that's interesting that's
[25149.61s -> 25155.58s]  why you know why why is that so that's one of the reasons why i like vinnie a lot you know he's
[25156.54s -> 25164.92s]  he gets it you know large with quotes what are you doing hey castle griffinstein has like
[25164.92s -> 25171.08s]  fucking two million views germa rumble live action got like a million views i'm a million
