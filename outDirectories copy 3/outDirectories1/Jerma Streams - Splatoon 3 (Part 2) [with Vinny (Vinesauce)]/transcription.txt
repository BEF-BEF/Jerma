[2.94s -> 18.06s]  Hey, how's it going? I'm uh... I'm here. Yeah. Go back to bed.
[18.06s -> 29.46s]  Um, no. I will, but not right now. Welcome back everybody. Are you in a sleeping bag?
[30.58s -> 38.58s]  I'm streaming from a sleeping bag. It sounds like you're going through puberty. Is that what you said?
[48.71s -> 52.71s]  All right, let's... let's address the thing that we need to address.
[54.26s -> 60.38s]  I have COVID. I don't think I... the last stream from, what, three or four days ago was like,
[60.38s -> 64.54s]  oh, I don't think I have COVID, but I'm testing every day and, you know, locking down and whatever,
[64.54s -> 78.76s]  right? Um, it's COVID. Yeah. You look at dirty teeth. No, I actually don't. But yeah, I have COVID.
[79.56s -> 85.48s]  I'm okay. Um, it's become pretty clear that I'm right in the middle of it and it's not really
[85.48s -> 92.54s]  going away, but I feel okay. I just kind of feel like somebody, like, like, punched me in the face.
[93.26s -> 98.04s]  You know what I mean? Like, I've got... I'm pretty congested and it just feels like somebody went,
[98.04s -> 105.75s]  like, wham! Just one right hook, right to my fucking face, right? Um, but I'm all right.
[109.59s -> 115.19s]  And I... I need to start to kind of get a little more active here, uh, released in my own little
[115.19s -> 123.75s]  personal, uh, bubble that I'm in, because tomorrow is the VR among us sus guy stream.
[124.39s -> 128.55s]  So I'm going to... I need to get better. I have to feel a little bit better and I do.
[129.35s -> 136.94s]  But today I wanted to go live and hang out for a little bit. Um, streams are obviously going to be
[136.94s -> 142.86s]  not, um, more than a few hours for the foreseeable future until I can kind of get over this.
[143.66s -> 154.23s]  But today we have something interesting. It's like, you know what? Why don't I, uh, why don't I
[154.23s -> 161.37s]  give a buzz to my good pal Vinny, uh, Vinesauce and, uh, just ask him to see if he wants to carry,
[161.37s -> 168.89s]  uh, carry a stream for me, because that makes sick. So, uh, me and Vinny are going to play Splatoon
[168.89s -> 174.44s]  Salmon Runs for a couple hours or something, two, three hours. Something we've been talking about
[174.44s -> 182.81s]  for a while. Um, so yeah, Vinny's going to carry my stream today. I'm not, I'm, I'm not going to
[182.81s -> 188.74s]  put like pressure on Vinny to like, oh dude, you got to carry. No. Um, but yeah, let's just play,
[188.74s -> 193.72s]  uh, Salmon Runs. Something that I've been looking forward to. We mentioned it like a few weeks ago,
[193.72s -> 212.01s]  so let's do it. I'm going to give Vinny a call right now. Yeah, I like forget how to play. Hey,
[212.01s -> 219.05s]  what's happening? Hi, how you doing? I'm doing, I'm doing all right. I mean, I've got, you know,
[219.93s -> 225.13s]  I got COVID. Is that all right though? You got it. Yeah. That's okay. Cause I mean,
[226.54s -> 231.02s]  you know, the Splatoon will wipe all that away. Yeah. I'm just, I'm, you know, I want to just play,
[231.02s -> 237.32s]  look, you know what I've been doing the last like three days straight? I've been, okay. So I've been
[237.32s -> 248.70s]  playing The Sims 4 on Xbox. Does that sound fucking weird to you? A little bit. Yeah. I mean,
[248.70s -> 253.82s]  you need something to take your mind off of it. Um, you know, listen, man, as long as, as long as
[253.82s -> 258.46s]  The Sims are giving you an alternate life where you cannot live your own, it's fine. You know what?
[258.46s -> 264.78s]  That's true. Yeah. But, uh, yeah. So me and my girlfriend have been just kind of playing it,
[265.50s -> 270.30s]  locking down. I'm sorry that I sound like I'm going through puberty. That's well, you know what? I'm
[270.30s -> 276.60s]  sorry. I have a milk voice today. It's okay. I've never heard that expression before, but
[277.24s -> 281.96s]  the past couple of weeks, I've been losing my voice and I've sounded like the Crypt Keeper.
[281.96s -> 287.16s]  So don't feel too bad. I think it's, you sound relatively human compared to how I sounded. It
[287.16s -> 291.32s]  was, it was horrendous. Well, I'm glad to at least be alive. And I'll tell you right now,
[291.32s -> 296.60s]  like the next couple of days, I mean, I think me and Vinny were talking about doing some VR stuff
[296.60s -> 302.84s]  too. Um, yeah, I, I'm, I might be like a fucking weirdo, but you know what I mean? I'm like on like
[302.84s -> 307.56s]  cold medicine, right? Like, so this is like, well, this is, this is the sus guy. You know
[307.56s -> 313.88s]  what I mean? Like, let's just lean into it. Yeah. Do it for, do it because you know what? You,
[313.88s -> 318.28s]  you won't have an opportunity to do it again. We're not getting any younger. Splatoon,
[318.28s -> 324.84s]  not Splatoon, Among Us VR is out tomorrow. And you know, I was telling my chat, I might play it.
[325.64s -> 331.24s]  There's a chance you and I will play it at some point. Maybe it'd be fun. So be the sus guy,
[331.32s -> 336.92s]  you know, like, like when people, listen, when I see something spin, they want me to be the spin
[336.92s -> 343.29s]  guy. They want me to say spin. I say it. That's okay. Yeah. I mean, it's only one day, by the way.
[343.29s -> 347.29s]  I'm never doing this ever again. The whole entire channel is going to be rebranded to the sus shit.
[347.29s -> 353.96s]  It's going to be one day only. So you better be there. Imagine how many people were going to be
[353.96s -> 357.64s]  confused if they just joined in off the front page. Like I've never heard of this guy before.
[357.64s -> 361.80s]  And then that's what they get. Part of the idea is that, um, dude, it's, I'm going to put like
[361.80s -> 365.80s]  branding everywhere. I'm going to have like a sub goal. I'm going to talk about,
[365.80s -> 368.68s]  it's going to be like, I'm not, I'm not even Jeremy. It's a different person.
[370.79s -> 376.60s]  And I like that. Like, how do we borrow that? Can I be, you want to be, you want to be the second
[376.60s -> 382.23s]  side? No, you don't. No, no, no. You don't want to do that. I'm good. Don't even say it. Do you want
[382.23s -> 387.27s]  to, do you want to do, do you want to do some regular matches first and then salmon run or
[387.27s -> 394.01s]  you just into whatever, whatever you want to do. Okay. Um, hop into a lobby and we can just do some
[394.01s -> 397.53s]  matches just to warm up and then we'll salmon. How do, how do, um, how do I play the game?
[400.49s -> 404.57s]  Yeah, I can, I can get you, I can get you that information. Hang on. It's been a couple of weeks.
[405.45s -> 411.86s]  Of right trigger is shoot gun, right? Yeah. Shoot. You jump with B you squid.
[413.19s -> 416.15s]  I slept on this game for so long, man. Like it did really is so much fun.
[419.06s -> 422.50s]  Yeah, this is great. I mean, it's just, it's just a lot of fun to play. And you know what,
[423.06s -> 426.42s]  even though it's not ghosts, it's pretty good. I know we have a reputation. I'm going,
[426.42s -> 431.54s]  I'm going into the lobby. I only play games to kill ghosts. We only play like scary ghost
[431.54s -> 441.83s]  games. It's the only thing we do. Oh, okay. I remember how to play. Um, so do you have to,
[441.83s -> 447.61s]  do you like join off me? Do I have to invite you to the lobby? Um, I think you can join off of me
[447.61s -> 454.25s]  if you want. That's cool. Just in like the switch menu. Yeah. I got a, so just press, um, L I think
[454.25s -> 460.01s]  and then you'll here. Let me see. Wait, which L? Oh, okay. Save. Yeah. Regular L, regular L.
[461.77s -> 470.18s]  Right. Okay. And then join lobby. You should see mine. Okay. I see with friends. Yeah. Regular
[470.18s -> 479.19s]  battle is what was your name? Uh, is your name raw? No. Who the fuck is that? It's definitely
[479.19s -> 484.71s]  not wrong. I've never seen this person before in my life. Maybe that's my alter ego. I don't know.
[485.51s -> 499.66s]  It's a raw guy. Okay. Um, I'm in lobby. I see with friends. Yeah. Yeah. So it should be like,
[500.22s -> 510.22s]  regular L match menu. And then I see, I see friends. I don't see you. We are friends on the
[510.22s -> 519.45s]  switch chat. Do I have like a weird setting or something? No, not anymore. I mean, if I did,
[519.45s -> 522.89s]  you, why don't you make one and just do with friends and then I'll, I'll join off of you.
[522.89s -> 527.45s]  Okay. So if I just do with friends, hop into a turf battle, regular battle with friends.
[528.78s -> 532.46s]  I just click regular battle with friends. Okay. Yeah. Oh, there you are.
[533.10s -> 542.54s]  Well, you saw me right there online. I can create a room. Okay. Okay. So I see, I can't like invite
[542.54s -> 548.66s]  you, but I see you're online. So I'm creating a room chat. How do I join German's room? Do I just
[548.66s -> 555.64s]  press his name? There's no password on it. So that's fine. Okay. I'm creating room boomer
[555.64s -> 571.45s]  technology stream. I've got COVID motherfucker. All right. It's, I got it chat. Not like in a mean
[571.45s -> 575.69s]  way. I meant like, let him have this, let him be his COVID self. And like, I don't know what I'm
[575.69s -> 580.01s]  doing either. I got it. All right. No, I got it. We know what we're doing. I'm not going to even
[580.01s -> 589.10s]  read that. Hey, we did it. All right. Cool. That's vile. All right. I think I'm, yeah, we'll
[589.10s -> 594.62s]  probably just get random people to join in. And then like, if any of my friends can join off of
[594.62s -> 601.26s]  me, you know, just like to be in the group and carry us, feel free. Yeah. I'm down just to play
[601.26s -> 606.06s]  whatever. Let's do a few, we can just kind of chill and get some stuff going. Calm down. You're
[606.06s -> 611.26s]  aggressive. Yeah. This is, this is a low effort, like just whatever, just play some Splat. I mean,
[611.26s -> 617.30s]  it's not even Splatfest yet. It's not? Is that a thing? Do you know what Splatfest is, Sharma?
[619.72s -> 625.08s]  It's when you vote on one of three things and like the team that gets the most kills and like
[625.08s -> 630.84s]  win games. That's the selected thing. So this, this Splatfest, it's the Pokemon starters. It's
[630.84s -> 636.36s]  fire, grass and water. And you get to choose, you join a team and then you have to like fight for
[636.36s -> 644.33s]  your team. That's this weekend. That's pretty cool. It's neat. I've been out of sync this whole time,
[644.33s -> 654.18s]  but now I'm good. That sounds fun. That's your Splatoon name? Yeah. You said it's so dejected.
[654.18s -> 660.71s]  I just like did it really quickly. Okay. What's wrong with my shirt today? What's
[661.03s -> 670.15s]  wrong with my shirt? He has COVID. Let him live his life. It's a Marvel shirt, not a clown shirt.
[675.29s -> 683.50s]  Then he go over to the robot and press A. Okay. Somebody called it an arcade carpet shirt.
[683.50s -> 692.82s]  Oh, there you are. It's pretty cool. So what do you usually play in this? Do you usually do
[692.82s -> 700.39s]  like painter or like shooter? What do you usually do? Oh, um, ready up germ. Oh, I'm calling you germ
[700.39s -> 708.31s]  for some reason. Is that okay? Yeah, that's good. All right. Oh, I use. Yeah, I use like
[709.19s -> 716.30s]  just shoot gun fast, but also with good range. I like that the dual pistols are fun. I like the
[716.30s -> 724.33s]  dodge. Yeah, I like those too. Oh, and so remind me how do you use your superpower? It's like a
[724.33s -> 735.26s]  button you press, right? Yeah, I think superpower is oh, I press R the stick precedent. Oh,
[735.26s -> 743.64s]  there it is. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's like this mech. Okay. Yeah. I have trouble with them with the mech.
[745.03s -> 751.03s]  Yeah, I suck with it, but it's the combo of the weapon I use. I can't choose anything else. It's
[751.03s -> 757.99s]  just like I'm stuck with it. Okay. All right. So you're a veteran of this game, right? I mean,
[757.99s -> 765.85s]  I'm fucking terrible at it, but yeah. Yeah. I have some ideas on how to like, uh, shoot.
[765.85s -> 769.45s]  Okay. It's been a while since I haven't played in a while. So let's see if I can see if I still got
[769.45s -> 775.29s]  it. All right. Let's get it. Let's get it. See now you understand. Yeah. That's, that's a good
[775.29s -> 783.38s]  catchphrase. Oh my God. Bubbles. They're fucking shooting bubbles at us already. Sorry. I just
[783.38s -> 789.22s]  don't like bubbles. It's a very annoying weapon. I'm fine. They, they shoot bubbles out of a urinal
[789.22s -> 795.22s]  germina. What? Out of a urinal? Hold on. They shoot it out of a urinal. I didn't know that. I
[795.22s -> 804.01s]  got to see this. It looks like it at least. I don't know what it is. Oh, I'm out of ink.
[807.06s -> 812.58s]  Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. You've okay. Good. You then you avenged me. Oh wait. It's the, um, it's the
[812.58s -> 819.22s]  bucket. It's like the bucket thing, right? Yeah. To me it looks like a, like a urinal or like, um,
[819.22s -> 829.48s]  like what are those things that they put? Like a bedpan, a bedpan with ink. Yeah. Oh God. What
[829.48s -> 837.93s]  even just hit me? I just, I got exploded. Yeah. We, we wiped. I have, I'm getting audio from two
[837.93s -> 844.06s]  different sources here. Is it like confusing? So how do you do your audio when you play the switch
[844.06s -> 853.14s]  and let, and talk to somebody? Uh, so I don't have anything on a delay. It's slightly delayed. Um,
[853.14s -> 860.02s]  essentially I am routing my capture card and I had an El Garbo too, by the way, for a while.
[860.02s -> 865.00s]  It focus almost just came out of my nose. I hope they didn't. No, no one saw that. Um, I, yeah,
[865.00s -> 870.52s]  I used El Garbo for a while. I had to get another one, which was even cheaper and it's fine. It does
[870.52s -> 876.44s]  the job. So basically I'm, um, audio is coming through a separate program, but the video is like
[876.44s -> 883.10s]  live, like, oh, I split. Yeah. So I don't have anything on a delay other than the audio is
[883.10s -> 889.10s]  delayed like half a second. So it's, there's a slight disconnect. We can kind of destroyed.
[890.81s -> 894.17s]  It's a warmup match. That's true though. Yeah. When was the last time you played? It's been a while
[894.17s -> 899.45s]  since I played. Three weeks. Yeah. We both played, we probably both played like the same day.
[900.81s -> 904.25s]  Yeah. Like to the day we both just got the urge to like, let's play some Splatoon.
[905.05s -> 911.61s]  Yeah. Separate. And then now we're garbage. That's okay. I have, uh, friends that are very good at
[911.61s -> 914.57s]  this game that are going to just hop in at some point and carry us. It's going to be great.
[914.57s -> 917.69s]  It's also all right too. We're going to be Sam and Andy's at some point, right?
[917.69s -> 921.94s]  All right. What's that? Sam and we're just going to be Sam and run Andy's or
[922.98s -> 927.06s]  Oh, oh, oh yeah. I thought you meant like Sam and Andy, like, like two names.
[927.62s -> 931.78s]  Oh, no, no, no. Like Sam and run. Like we're going to be Sam and Andy. We're going to do that. Uh-huh.
[936.38s -> 943.06s]  Sam and Andy. I was like, I'll be Sam. I guess. I don't know. That's fine. I don't even know
[943.06s -> 951.14s]  where'd you come from. All right. So how did we do on our first game back after three weeks of
[951.14s -> 958.54s]  being away from the game? Like 35%, 38%. That's all right. That would be, we, that we,
[958.54s -> 965.61s]  high MMR. It's our, our far from being so good. Yeah. I was wondering, so I have the game audio
[965.61s -> 972.07s]  coming through my left ear and then you coming into my right ear through here. So I, it's like,
[972.07s -> 979.43s]  it's weird. I have two different headphones. Are you okay? It's kind of, it's kind of bizarre
[979.43s -> 983.26s]  if you want me to be completely honest with you, but I can do it. It's fun.
[983.90s -> 991.94s]  Okay. Uh, okay. Cool. Yeah. That's what I couldn't do that. That's just too much. That's,
[991.94s -> 996.18s]  that's too disconnect would throw me off. Yeah. I think it would like my circadian rhythm,
[996.82s -> 1000.74s]  like I would fall, like I'd be streaming and just fall to the ground. Cause my inner ear balance
[1000.74s -> 1006.18s]  would be thrown off. I didn't even get like a, like 2002 resolution for my score. Like,
[1006.18s -> 1018.38s]  holy shit, I'm under four ADP. That's bad. So, all right, let's do battle times. Maybe I should
[1018.38s -> 1027.83s]  change my loadout. I gotta, I gotta, we gotta get back into it. The game. Oh yeah. We got,
[1027.83s -> 1032.47s]  no, we get this. We got this. We got Nari now on our team. He's a mod of mine. He's,
[1032.47s -> 1037.03s]  he's going to carry. Oh, right. Nari. Really? All right. Let's go. His name rhymes with carry.
[1037.75s -> 1042.63s]  So he's going to carry us. If not, I'm going to remove him from my moderator's team. It's fine.
[1042.63s -> 1067.35s]  It's normal. It's fine. All right. I'm going to try hard this time. Actually. Come on. I got him. I
[1067.35s -> 1080.49s]  got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. What does that thing do? I think it's a grenade. Right.
[1081.69s -> 1095.58s]  Top right is a sprayer. Okay. Can we destroy those? Yeah. Yeah, you can. Oh, I am bad at this right
[1095.58s -> 1106.82s]  now. Hey, um, do you, do you only use the duallys? No, I just, it's just what I had equipped them last
[1106.82s -> 1113.86s]  time when I was playing. Okay. Cause I've tried other weapons in this game and I, and I'm just
[1113.86s -> 1125.48s]  rotten at all of them, including the ones that I'm good at. There's so much of their ink everywhere
[1125.48s -> 1139.94s]  I can't even move. They're throwing bubbles at us from a urinal again. No ink. There ain't no ink
[1139.94s -> 1154.42s]  anywhere. I just got so bad. We, no, we got this. We got it. Ooh, bubbles. Throwing for content.
[1155.54s -> 1169.64s]  Yeah. Ready to go to the right place? What just happened? Oh, I did. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[1170.20s -> 1175.88s]  What the? Dude, those bubbles kill you in one hit. The bubbles are such bullshit. I really don't
[1175.88s -> 1182.65s]  understand them. And then they update the game and it just like, bubbles are even better than
[1182.65s -> 1186.81s]  usual. That's like all the, all the balance changes and bubbles have just seemed better
[1186.81s -> 1191.69s]  and better each day. How do I get that gun? Is that, how much was that? I still don't, I don't
[1191.69s -> 1206.90s]  even have bubble. I don't know where it is. No, I don't, I don't know. Let's go. They don't know
[1206.90s -> 1217.24s]  that they can buy whatever they want. Well, now I do. God damn it. Chad, that's the exact line of
[1217.24s -> 1222.78s]  thinking that got me back into Pokemon cards. We, we don't need that again. Shooting the floor. I
[1222.78s -> 1231.10s]  don't even know how to control that thing, man. Shit. Dude, that, you know what that looks like?
[1231.10s -> 1238.63s]  That looks like a fucking Trix yogurt. I want it wicked bad. I've never had Trix yogurt. Really?
[1238.63s -> 1245.24s]  Wow. No, no, this just reminds me of Nickelodeon. Yeah. It's just like, like, like you win an,
[1245.24s -> 1248.84s]  your name is Jack Black. You win an award and they just like slime you for no good reason.
[1249.48s -> 1255.64s]  It's fun though. That's how we grew up. That was it. So do they want to do like how many more you
[1255.64s -> 1263.74s]  want to do before we do the salmon run? Let's do one more. We did, we did better that time. That's
[1263.74s -> 1267.91s]  a, come on. Look, we haven't played in a long time. Give us a little bit of slack. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1267.91s -> 1277.53s]  I think one, one more would be good. Guys stop streaming. I'm at work. All right. We'll, we'll
[1277.53s -> 1282.57s]  just see you later, man. It's nice to hang out. I've got to wrap it up. So, so, uh,
[1282.57s -> 1289.56s]  Jerma, your symptoms, you're, you're just like, you got a headache and stuff. Yeah. So I had a
[1289.56s -> 1295.56s]  headache like two days ago. So we're three days ago. I don't even remember. Um, I was on stream
[1295.56s -> 1299.16s]  and like the day before this is, what was the last time I streamed guys? I actually don't even remember.
[1300.04s -> 1308.33s]  Um, I had kind of like an achy slow felt kind of shitty. It was three days ago. Okay. And then
[1309.29s -> 1315.06s]  that just developed into just, I was tired and I still am. Yeah. And now I just kind of have a lot
[1315.06s -> 1320.26s]  of, I'm not really coughing though. No cough really at all. It's more just like somebody
[1320.26s -> 1326.89s]  like punched me in the face and like my nose is stuffed. And that didn't happen, right? No.
[1328.25s -> 1331.05s]  Okay. Well, yeah, I see. I mean, unrelated. I got punched in the face.
[1332.17s -> 1337.61s]  This is your first time like with the COVID? Yeah. I didn't get it for the entire time
[1338.25s -> 1344.74s]  that it was, you know, during the major, major, major surges. Lucky enough, right? Yeah. I
[1345.70s -> 1352.65s]  avoided it up until about June or July rather of this year. And it was, I couldn't like,
[1353.37s -> 1358.17s]  yeah, I had the same symptoms like headache, tired fever. And then, um, it was like a week
[1358.17s -> 1362.33s]  of not being able to eat food because my throat hurt so much. It was like broken glass and razor
[1362.33s -> 1367.29s]  blades. Yeah. I'm so I've, I mean, obviously knock on wood, right? Because I'm currently
[1367.29s -> 1372.09s]  right in the middle of it. Um, I've been testing every, I want to say we're not, I haven't been
[1372.09s -> 1376.97s]  testing the last few days, obviously, because I have it, but I tested today. You know, you can
[1376.97s -> 1385.13s]  tell how much, you know, whatever viral, um, well, I guess whatever it is. So hold on. Let me like,
[1385.13s -> 1399.10s]  at least don't embarrass myself for five seconds while I talk. Okay. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta,
[1400.06s -> 1411.67s]  I gotta hold on. Okay. Okay. I can talk again. Okay. So, uh, use your special. I guys, I, I can't,
[1411.67s -> 1418.38s]  I don't even, I can't even see. Um, what was I saying? So yeah, you've been testing and stuff
[1418.38s -> 1423.82s]  just to make sure you didn't have like a high viral load. Okay. So don't laugh at that. No,
[1423.82s -> 1427.50s]  no, no. I'm just laughing. This is science. This is like medicine. No, I'm laughing at the fact
[1427.50s -> 1434.94s]  that I fucking have zero points. I think. Oh, come on. We have zero points. How can I look?
[1435.98s -> 1439.50s]  Are you sure this game is good for you in your weakened state? If you're going to,
[1439.50s -> 1443.34s]  you know what I mean? Like you may not have a voice after this. No, no, I'll be all right.
[1443.34s -> 1450.22s]  I'll be all right. I just want to make sure I have more than five points. Okay. Okay. So, um,
[1450.22s -> 1453.66s]  when you take a COVID test and that, that line that's at the bottom, right? It's like, oh,
[1453.66s -> 1458.94s]  is it faded? That's positive. Is it, you know, I'm not even playing anymore. I just got like
[1458.94s -> 1465.90s]  killed instantly. Um, like is the line, the line is like solid, solid, solid. Like I'm,
[1465.90s -> 1473.10s]  I'm in the middle of it right now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry, man. I hope you feel better soon.
[1473.10s -> 1478.38s]  I appreciate it. Thank you. I feel all right though. It's not, I'm not a good enough stream,
[1478.38s -> 1483.66s]  right? I mean, that's, that's a positive. Yeah. It's a positive on top of the wrong kind of
[1483.66s -> 1488.14s]  positive. Well, honestly, I'll be completely upfront. I really just kind of want to be live
[1488.14s -> 1493.26s]  for a little while just because tomorrow's a big day. Tomorrow's a huge day. Yeah. I gotta be
[1494.22s -> 1497.90s]  confident that I can be kind of live for more than a few hours. You know what I mean?
[1497.90s -> 1502.46s]  Yeah, I hear you. And you want to acclimate yourself. Well, I'm, I'm happy to help. I mean,
[1502.46s -> 1509.26s]  this is, this is a thrill to just lose Splatoon with you is a dream come true. So I'm down.
[1509.90s -> 1513.66s]  Yeah. Let's do, let's do the salmon run. Let's do salmon run. Cause that way we
[1513.66s -> 1516.86s]  aren't going to get killed immediately and we're going to have fun. It's going to be great.
[1516.86s -> 1522.87s]  I mean, that was fun too, but yeah, but yeah, but it's heartbreaking.
[1527.08s -> 1536.50s]  All right. No, but no, it's a, it's to be all jokes aside. I feel okay. Now are you going to
[1536.50s -> 1545.48s]  feel okay in a headset in VR? We'll see. Hey, I mean, if there's ever a scream to be like
[1545.48s -> 1550.84s]  fucked up, it's tomorrow. Let me tell you. Like if I don't, if I feel like fucked up tomorrow,
[1550.84s -> 1555.00s]  like who, it's the suss guy day. Like I don't, it doesn't, I don't care. It doesn't matter,
[1555.00s -> 1559.56s]  right? Yeah. You just have to like leave your like meat, like your flesh behind for a little
[1559.56s -> 1565.32s]  bit and just be an entity. Like, you know what? Be a goblin for a short time and then it'll be
[1565.32s -> 1571.16s]  over and you can relax. It'll be great. So how do I, so we do, do I have to join a different menu?
[1572.95s -> 1576.79s]  Yeah. So I'm going to, I'll make it this time and you can join in. Um, cause I have,
[1577.75s -> 1582.07s]  I have some people on my friends list that are fantastic. Hacker, are you going to join Hacker?
[1583.66s -> 1597.19s]  Hacker will carry us. Yes. Okay. Splatoon. Uh, I'm said Splatoon run. Is it such a fun game?
[1597.19s -> 1602.23s]  Splatoon run sounds like the iPad game they come up with where you just are on a lane and you have
[1602.23s -> 1606.79s]  to go like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Left and right and collect coins and jump over obstacles.
[1607.67s -> 1613.59s]  Right. And it's like no regard for copyright, complete disregard for all of Nintendo's IP.
[1618.04s -> 1621.16s]  Okay. So, um, have you beaten the chicken in a salmon run?
[1622.44s -> 1630.70s]  I've beaten the chicken. Yeah. I call it chorizo. Yeah. No, um, sin or base can, uh, I'm ready by
[1630.70s -> 1636.06s]  the way, German. If you go press L go to salmon run and then you find, uh, do the same thing from
[1636.06s -> 1642.70s]  before you can join, um, base or sin, we can rotate you guys out, but I want to get Hacker in
[1642.70s -> 1652.20s]  because we, we need to win. Um, so I see private battle, regular battle, and then, uh, friend
[1652.20s -> 1662.02s]  request received. Oh, great. Uh, I think, yeah, you have to go into the salmon run lobby grisco.
[1662.02s -> 1666.18s]  Oh, I actually go to the lobby. Okay. Yeah. You have to, uh, press like,
[1666.90s -> 1675.06s]  what is it? Yeah. And then you'll see, see me and I'm recruiting. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.
[1675.06s -> 1685.85s]  So now match menu and with friends, I freelance. I think freelance. Yeah. And you should see me.
[1685.85s -> 1693.66s]  There you are joinable. Let's go. All right. Let's do it. The audio is fucked up. It is.
[1699.32s -> 1703.00s]  Okay. There's, there's, let's get it. And, uh, we just need one more. So,
[1703.00s -> 1708.86s]  okay. Thank you, sin sin. We'll, we'll get you rotated in, in a bit. All right. Yeah. I love
[1708.86s -> 1724.36s]  this mode. Nari, you have to leave Nari hackers joining not Nari. I promise you Nari, we will have,
[1725.08s -> 1728.92s]  we will get you in. We're going to, we're going to rotate people out. It's going to be great.
[1728.92s -> 1735.02s]  I'm not at all confusing and annoying because Nintendo has the best online infrastructure.
[1736.95s -> 1744.71s]  Yeah. I, this, and this game is like, I mean, okay, this game has felt the most online complete out
[1744.71s -> 1748.71s]  of any Nintendo game I've ever played. Does that make sense? Agreed. Okay. Yeah. A hundred percent.
[1748.71s -> 1758.38s]  Yeah. I mean, smash was okay. Smash had its moments where it felt easy and then it also
[1758.38s -> 1764.71s]  sometimes felt awful, but this one feels pretty good. Yeah. It's not bad. The only problem I have
[1764.71s -> 1770.92s]  with it is a lot of disconnects. I've seen thankfully that only seems to happen to be in
[1770.92s -> 1775.40s]  a lobby and not in a game. I haven't seen it in a game. You know, obviously knock on wood.
[1775.40s -> 1781.32s]  I've said that like three times today now. You know, knock on wood. My family used to say that.
[1781.32s -> 1787.80s]  That was like a big one. Knock on wood. And uh, Jerma, have you ever heard of the Maloikia knife?
[1788.52s -> 1796.44s]  The Maloikia knife? Yeah. No. What's a Maloikia knife? I'll tell you about it. This is real,
[1796.44s -> 1802.20s]  by the way. I grew up with, um, so my, my family's Italian Americans, those that don't know me over
[1802.20s -> 1806.84s]  in Jerma's channel. I'm a New Yorker. So, you know, it's kind of, yeah, of course, you know,
[1807.72s -> 1813.00s]  right off the boat. And, um, one of the things that they would do, my grandmother and my great
[1813.00s -> 1816.52s]  grandparents when I was really young, but my grandmother picked up this thing was they had
[1816.52s -> 1822.52s]  a knife, the Maloikia knife. And whenever someone was sick, they would throw the knife across the
[1822.52s -> 1832.22s]  room to ward off evil spirits. Oh my God. Yep. Now I've told this story on my stream and I'm like,
[1832.22s -> 1836.86s]  chat, I know I'm insane. There's no way this is real. This is a false memory. It's implanted by
[1836.86s -> 1843.26s]  some movie or something, but it's real because some other families have done this too. This is
[1843.26s -> 1847.26s]  an old Italian thing where they thought that like, when you got sick, it was like spirits.
[1848.22s -> 1853.77s]  Wait, we're going to lose on round one? No, no, I think we, we got this. We got this.
[1854.97s -> 1859.13s]  So, so wait, so if somebody started to get sick, you said, like some, all of a sudden
[1859.13s -> 1863.69s]  somebody would throw a knife at like a wall. Yeah. My grandmother would throw a knife and
[1863.69s -> 1867.61s]  say Jesu Christu or something like Jesus, you know, in Italian. And then she would throw the
[1867.61s -> 1874.49s]  knife at the wall. Were people in the room? Yeah. Oh, it's gone flying past me several times.
[1874.49s -> 1879.69s]  Oh my God. Yeah. I was, this stopped happening when I was like seven, but it was definitely a
[1879.69s -> 1885.45s]  thing. I don't know if the Maloyka knife is still in my family, but if it is, I'm selling it cheap,
[1885.45s -> 1892.73s]  chat, if you want it. By the way, selling, selling things are cheap. I wish I could, I hate this
[1892.73s -> 1897.61s]  weapon. I don't want it anymore. How do I get rid of this? Next round. This fucking umbrella
[1897.61s -> 1904.39s]  shotgun thing sucks absolute ass. I hate this thing. Yeah. Speaking of selling things.
[1909.42s -> 1914.06s]  I've never heard of that before. Oh, you want to just get rid of the weapon. That's what you were
[1914.06s -> 1917.58s]  trying to say. Okay. Yeah. No, it's just a weird thing. I just thought that you might find it
[1917.58s -> 1926.36s]  interesting. That is some wacky, wacky traditions. What was it called again? A Maloyka knife.
[1927.32s -> 1937.51s]  Yeah. Right. You can throw the eggs too, right? You can throw them. Yeah. They cost as much as
[1937.51s -> 1943.58s]  it takes for a grenade. Okay. So you probably know, but for these lads, yeah, you're gonna
[1943.58s -> 1950.25s]  throw a grenade in their mouth. Yep. So I'm assuming you've played mostly salmon run, right?
[1950.25s -> 1954.97s]  I pretty much, I spent a little bit of time doing the other game, but this was like more fun to me
[1954.97s -> 1973.42s]  in my brain. Yeah. This is the best mode. Oh, please. What? They don't go in his mouth.
[1974.86s -> 1987.67s]  Sometimes they bounce out. Yeah. Yeah. How many do we have? 23. 23. Yeah. We're good. We're good.
[1990.65s -> 2003.62s]  Anything else is a bonus at this point. They get it. There you go. We can't have,
[2003.62s -> 2008.47s]  it has to be more than that. So what, what if we, what rank are we on right now? What
[2008.47s -> 2013.75s]  we put difficulties is technically, I don't think this is all that high in difficulty because
[2015.86s -> 2020.66s]  I demoted, I did so bad at one point that I got like demoted a couple of times.
[2020.66s -> 2028.10s]  So this is like normal ish, I think this is a new weapon I've never seen before. It's like a burst
[2028.10s -> 2035.69s]  cannon. Yeah, those are good. That's okay. All right, German. So for this one, you got to shoot
[2036.65s -> 2044.01s]  the spigots. They're called what? Yeah, you know, the geysers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So shoot them like
[2044.01s -> 2048.97s]  regular shoot them like just like what I'm doing right now. So you shoot, shoot them until they
[2048.97s -> 2055.37s]  start, they burst and then you'll see eventually a fish will emerge from them. The golden, it's a
[2055.37s -> 2062.30s]  little confusing, but there's, there's now a golden fish that we have to shoot. That's some
[2062.94s -> 2073.94s]  crunchies over here. Right here. Right here. This basically gives me like anxiety.
[2080.01s -> 2082.73s]  Yeah, it's like if John Williams composed Jaws on cocaine.
[2083.77s -> 2088.71s]  All right. So these are the guys are going off. Do we need to do anything with it or no?
[2089.35s -> 2093.19s]  When it goes off, you're good. You just have to get a bunch of them open and that way we
[2093.19s -> 2103.00s]  spawn a golden, a golden fish thing. So yeah, just, yeah. Okay. Golden fish spawning at my
[2103.00s -> 2109.82s]  location. Golden fish is spawning at my location on my way. That's what that means. Right. Uh huh.
[2110.62s -> 2127.37s]  Oh, wait, is it? Oh, here it is. No, it's here. Germ. All right. Get it. We got tremendously close
[2127.37s -> 2132.89s]  to not succeeding. Yeah. I'm very rusty. Oops. I pressed, I actually pressed R at the set of
[2132.89s -> 2138.89s]  whatever. Vinny, try not to open too many valves or else you'll get mobbed with other enemies.
[2139.69s -> 2147.58s]  The higher the geysers are, the closer the goldfish is. Oh my God. We nailed it. I'm so confused.
[2148.78s -> 2157.61s]  I'm getting bad advice from my chat. Does your chat ever give you like, um, bad advice? Um,
[2159.06s -> 2165.37s]  I'm trying to remember the last time I got good advice from them. Okay. I think it was probably,
[2165.37s -> 2171.93s]  um, I want to say seven or eight years ago. Oh, all right. Yeah, that's, that's pretty good.
[2171.93s -> 2175.69s]  Somebody told me to buy a certain key in TF2 and like, don't buy these ones. I went, I was like,
[2175.69s -> 2179.05s]  oh, what does that mean? And then I gave it up being a good, I did like advice or a certain
[2179.05s -> 2187.45s]  crate or something. That's cool. My chat was like, Vin, you should get Dogecoin. Trust me.
[2187.45s -> 2196.63s]  10 K Dogecoin. I was like, all right. No, I didn't do that. You should get Doge. I should get it now.
[2198.09s -> 2202.33s]  That would probably be smart. Like, like after the fucking crypto collapse.
[2203.83s -> 2219.42s]  It's just fucked up. All right. I got the gun. All right. I'm going to, let's see if I can get
[2219.42s -> 2227.18s]  some high scores here. Okay. Oh, the UFO is my favorite one. I'm, I'm really going to get in the
[2227.18s -> 2261.21s]  UFO. All right. There we go. Ooh, no way. We both recently had a strange phenomenon happen to us.
[2262.25s -> 2266.30s]  What happened? We were both, we were both on the news for different reasons.
[2266.94s -> 2274.22s]  Yeah. You were on like CNN. So fucking weird. What were you on? Like, what was your, what did they
[2274.22s -> 2280.22s]  do? I didn't see it. Well, like, what was your thing? Um, well, there's been a few that, I mean,
[2281.66s -> 2287.10s]  well, I don't know about on the news. I did an NPR interview. Okay. That was cool. That was really
[2287.10s -> 2295.93s]  fun. It's cool. But like, you were actually like on like CNN. I was interviewed because I played
[2295.93s -> 2302.25s]  trombone champ. That's the only reason they had me on. It was, it was like a 30 second
[2303.21s -> 2307.93s]  total amount of me on the screen, but it got shut out to like a thousand places.
[2307.93s -> 2312.33s]  People were saying they saw me on their local news. I was like, why? That's so fucking awesome.
[2314.01s -> 2318.54s]  So wait, how did that happen? Did you just kind of get reached out to like, oh, hey,
[2318.54s -> 2322.62s]  we're just even playing this game. You want to know the truth? I mean, I've,
[2322.62s -> 2326.38s]  yeah, whatever the story is, I'd like to hear it. The reporter's son was a fan of mine.
[2326.46s -> 2332.86s]  Really? Yeah. He's like, dad, you got to see this game. This guy, Vinny plays it. That's the cutest
[2332.86s -> 2337.58s]  thing I've ever heard. Yeah. That's so weird though. I was like, all right, yeah, I'll be on the news.
[2337.58s -> 2344.14s]  All right. That's fine. Slow news day. Oh, I know this one. You have to throw it into the, uh,
[2344.14s -> 2359.70s]  receptacles, right? Oh goodness. That's like a, I mean, here's the thing though.
[2361.02s -> 2367.02s]  You can always kind of reach back to that no matter what. Like, oh yeah, you know, how,
[2367.02s -> 2371.58s]  you know, how did you, how was your career? What did you do? Well, I was on CNN. You know what I
[2371.58s -> 2376.78s]  mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good enough. Like I'm fine with that. Like at the top of your resume,
[2376.78s -> 2380.70s]  no matter what happens, no matter what happens for the next like 50 years of your life,
[2380.70s -> 2387.42s]  that could be at the top of your resume. It could be. So I will, here's the thing. I will tell you
[2387.42s -> 2392.86s]  that it was not good enough to get me verified on Twitter. What? It was, uh, yeah, there was
[2392.86s -> 2398.06s]  a denial. And now that, um, the muskrat has taken over, that whole thing is just a complete
[2398.06s -> 2403.08s]  clusterfuck. I have no idea what's happening anymore. But I said, you know what? Now that
[2403.08s -> 2406.84s]  I've been on the news and I'm like kind of a big deal in the trombone champ community, I should,
[2407.48s -> 2411.16s]  let me apply. Let me see if it happens. I got like, it's probably a good word.
[2412.12s -> 2416.36s]  30 minutes later I was denied. I got like a Mondo rejection. What happened to my title?
[2417.72s -> 2422.84s]  Why is this my title? This title is fucking disgusting. What the fuck is this title?
[2422.84s -> 2429.91s]  I didn't do this title. The title of the stream. I didn't make this title. I don't know what you
[2429.91s -> 2432.71s]  mean. I just saw in chat somebody said, dude, what the fuck were you thinking with this title?
[2432.71s -> 2439.70s]  And I'm like, what are they talking about? Oh, okay. I think one of my mods, it says like I'm
[2439.70s -> 2445.86s]  shitting my pants and stuff. What does it say? I shouldn't have eaten that sushi. It gave me salmon
[2445.86s -> 2454.68s]  runs. Who did this? With mods like that, who needs chat members? That's really good. All right. I
[2454.68s -> 2463.45s]  got to hate this weapon. The salmon runs. I can't even change it. They're blaming, they're blaming
[2463.45s -> 2473.96s]  Josh. Oh, that's, that's, that's, that's it. Josh is a good lad by the way. We've, Josh and I have
[2473.96s -> 2482.42s]  played Valheim together a lot back in the day. A lot of VR stuff too. I probably wasted that, but
[2483.22s -> 2489.26s]  no, Josh is, Josh is, Josh is a good dude. Unless he's the guy that changed your title, in which case.
[2489.26s -> 2497.21s]  Yeah, in which case like what the fuck does this guy think he is? Right, exactly. I can be the
[2497.21s -> 2505.08s]  depositor if you just throw him. Okay. You can also use this receptacle here. This like device,
[2505.08s -> 2530.60s]  it shoots them. So this is. Oh, we got to, these guys are the worst. I hate this weapon. I'm just
[2530.60s -> 2541.35s]  using it. Okay. Thank God. Thank God I did that. We're in a little bit of trouble here. I'm trying
[2541.35s -> 2559.18s]  to. We're good. We're good. Okay. Good. Good. Get a couple extra. Yeah, I can get it. Oh, okay.
[2559.74s -> 2564.10s]  Yeah, we're good. We're good. The NPR article has a funny picture of you.
[2565.42s -> 2568.70s]  You know, I saw somebody mention this and I've, I've heard, I've said this myself as well.
[2569.42s -> 2573.42s]  There are like four pictures of me that exist on the internet that anybody uses for anything.
[2574.38s -> 2578.46s]  There's like the one where I'm, I don't hate it and I don't know why people keep using it,
[2578.46s -> 2582.14s]  but I guess it's like one of like three pictures I have. You know, the one I'm talking about where
[2582.14s -> 2586.06s]  I'm like. Is it the one where they say that you look like a psycho? That's what I'm going like this.
[2587.13s -> 2594.10s]  I'm not, I can't see you. Oh, right. But you know what I mean? I'm going and people use it for
[2594.10s -> 2600.89s]  fucking everything. It's a blurry photo. I got like kind of messy hair. It's like a screen cap
[2600.89s -> 2609.88s]  from a random face, full face cam thing that I did. Um, base, can you rotate out so we can
[2609.88s -> 2616.92s]  get someone else in? Okay. Nevermind. Uh, next time base, next match. Um, yeah, no, it's weird
[2616.92s -> 2623.54s]  because also you do, you're on camera a lot. I'm not. And like, you have thousands of hours
[2623.54s -> 2628.74s]  of photos and like video of you. And if they use those same four, they're just doing it to spite you.
[2628.74s -> 2639.30s]  Yeah, that's clearly like you could take. Okay. Ready? Like, like use one of those.
[2639.30s -> 2642.98s]  Well, I think it's the same picture from what I like from the fucking basement.
[2645.37s -> 2649.69s]  Like you could, how many images of you can take a frame grab and just kind of blow it up and clean
[2649.69s -> 2653.13s]  it up and make it, you know what I mean? I'm, you know, I'm doing my own headshots later.
[2654.01s -> 2656.94s]  We're going, we're going, we're going, we're going to do this. I might be sick, but I don't
[2656.94s -> 2661.74s]  even care. I'm going to full cam and I'm just going to do various poses that you can use. And
[2661.74s -> 2666.14s]  please use, if you're going to write articles about this fucking scream, use those. We'll do
[2666.14s -> 2671.18s]  that. Maybe not. Maybe not today. I just said I was going to do it today.
[2675.38s -> 2677.70s]  You're like, I don't care. I'm sick. I'll do it now. It's fine.
[2680.28s -> 2685.80s]  I actually had, um, here's another weird one. I had some photographer ended up being a really
[2685.80s -> 2691.08s]  nice dude. Want to take a headshot of me in like Washington square park in Manhattan.
[2691.08s -> 2697.88s]  Yeah. And the idea was, I thought like, is this like some kind of weird thing? But it was a weird
[2697.88s -> 2702.92s]  thing, but not in the way I expected. He took photos of various like content creators and
[2702.92s -> 2709.96s]  YouTubers and then posted them on a website with just their subscriber number. That was it.
[2710.60s -> 2715.48s]  It was art. It was art, bro. It was, it's like not their name. My name wasn't on there.
[2716.44s -> 2722.92s]  It was just a number. Yeah. Yeah. That was the goal. It was like, the idea was it was trying to
[2722.92s -> 2728.44s]  kind of, I mean, if you have to explain the art, it's not good art, I guess, but I'm, uh, essentially,
[2728.44s -> 2733.40s]  yeah, it's like online. You're only valued by the number of subscribers you have kind of thing.
[2733.40s -> 2738.04s]  That's the, what it was trying, but people have just turned that into like a nightmare, like,
[2739.00s -> 2741.91s]  like meat rot photo of me using AI.
[2743.43s -> 2751.53s]  Do AI is fucked up. I'm, I'm serious. I have probably had more to say, but that was,
[2751.53s -> 2757.29s]  I guess all I was going to say. That's fair. I mean, yeah, I know the, I think that picture
[2757.29s -> 2763.61s]  of the meat, right? No, there's like, there's like this photo that looks like a headshot,
[2763.61s -> 2768.25s]  but then they put it through AI and it interpreted it in like the most bizarre way possible. And it's
[2768.25s -> 2773.13s]  like the same way you kind of have the sus guy photo. Oh, okay. This is just like a terrible,
[2773.13s -> 2778.33s]  terrible photo of me, but at least it has, you know, my subscribers. Yeah. At least that
[2778.33s -> 2785.06s]  people do know how many subs you have. Yeah. That's the important part. Somebody said my
[2785.06s -> 2790.12s]  microphone's fucked up. No, my voice is. It probably sounds like I'm talking through a wall
[2790.12s -> 2800.23s]  because I kind of am. I'm talking through a wall, which is my congestion. Yeah. Chad, do you know
[2801.03s -> 2807.26s]  what picture I'm talking about? If anyone can like grab that photo, I just want to show,
[2807.26s -> 2815.27s]  I want to put that on the screen after this match. These guys are rough. He has a big grenade heads.
[2816.41s -> 2823.99s]  Yeah, I don't, I don't like them at all at higher levels. This, this is absurd. I can imagine.
[2824.55s -> 2831.75s]  Diamond run is just absurd. And if you like even just casual conversation like we're having
[2831.75s -> 2837.99s]  is enough to ruin the match. You know, it does feel that way. You know what I don't understand?
[2837.99s -> 2842.15s]  And like, like honestly, if you were, if you can do this, I know a lot of like streamers can do
[2842.15s -> 2845.99s]  this and a lot of people like probably watching and the chats can do this too, but I don't know
[2845.99s -> 2851.19s]  how people play video games at a very high level. Well, just talking about like whatever,
[2852.07s -> 2856.47s]  like people like, you know, playing Valorant and they're like, and then they're talking about like
[2856.47s -> 2859.03s]  their favorite Dunkin Donuts order and shit. It's like, I don't even know how people do that.
[2859.59s -> 2867.27s]  Right. Yeah, I can play like low, low effort baby games, but not. Yeah. I can't hear it. Oh,
[2867.27s -> 2875.16s]  fuck. Yeah. Chad, here's the photo. Jerma, I'm going to put this in our call and you can
[2875.16s -> 2883.51s]  when on your own time. Oh my God. It's fucking horrendous. You look like an alien that ate
[2883.51s -> 2894.81s]  Vinny and like became him. Yeah. Which explains a lot. I mean, that it's scary. Yeah.
[2898.01s -> 2902.55s]  All right. Let me get back up there. Yeah. AI isn't a really especially AI images.
[2902.55s -> 2905.59s]  They're in such a weird place where do you feel like when you look at an AI image,
[2906.15s -> 2909.83s]  you are looking at the way that stuff actually feels and looks like in a dream?
[2910.95s -> 2917.35s]  Yeah, I've I've had the same thought. Yeah, absolutely. Like you can't grasp it. It's just
[2917.99s -> 2922.42s]  the more you look at it, the worse it gets. Who's shooting us with that laser?
[2924.02s -> 2927.78s]  Yeah. If I had a dream that you and I went to go get like a piece of pizza somewhere,
[2927.86s -> 2935.85s]  this is what you would look like in my dream. Right. Right. And yet you have to see
[2936.89s -> 2943.13s]  some of the new AI stuff. Like I saw some photos where I was like, that's a real person. Yeah.
[2943.13s -> 2948.73s]  I couldn't tell the difference until I looked at their hands. It's always the hands, right?
[2948.73s -> 2953.37s]  You know, like when someone's like deceptively old and they had a lot of work done. But if
[2953.37s -> 2960.01s]  you look at their hands, you know, interesting, interesting. I'm telling you, like Martha Stewart,
[2960.81s -> 2969.21s]  she she's like 80. She looks like she's 50 at most, but her hands are 90. Wow. AI is the same way
[2969.21s -> 2975.69s]  because it adds like five fingers and like makes them all weird. Yeah. Hands are the giveaway.
[2975.69s -> 2979.93s]  That's that's the trick. You'll always know, right? That kind of like if you're in a dream,
[2979.93s -> 2985.37s]  you look at a clock. Right. Yeah. If you look at it, you guys don't know if you're in a dream
[2985.37s -> 2990.49s]  and you like don't know if you're dreaming or not. If you look at a clock, it'll just be a bunch of
[2990.49s -> 3000.28s]  it'll be a mess. It won't be like alien language. I have like, do you have recurring dreams, Jerma?
[3000.28s -> 3007.62s]  I do. What are do you have any specific locations that you go back to? A lot of my recurring dreams
[3007.62s -> 3013.94s]  are in my bedroom. Like I'll wake up and it's one of those things where I'll wake up five to ten
[3013.94s -> 3019.38s]  times in a row in a different dream in my bed. And I just can't escape the dream world. It's
[3019.38s -> 3026.57s]  happened like three or four times now. Shit. It'll be like, okay, I'm awake now. And it's like,
[3026.57s -> 3031.83s]  no, I'm like a weird AI version of my bedroom. And no, this is something's weird. Something's off.
[3031.83s -> 3037.19s]  And then something really strange will happen. And I wake up again. And the same feeling happens.
[3037.19s -> 3042.47s]  It's like, okay, I'm obviously not this is not real. Because you know, this is not real,
[3042.47s -> 3048.54s]  because my bed frame is not 10 feet around the bed. Right. This is not accurate, right?
[3049.58s -> 3052.30s]  Stuff like that will just keep happening. And I'll keep waking up and being like terrified.
[3054.78s -> 3060.62s]  Jesus. Yeah, even that. Yeah, I don't have that experience personally. That's, that's, that's.
[3060.62s -> 3065.34s]  Yeah, you'll kind of wake up. If those of you that have these recurring kind of bedroom dreams,
[3065.34s -> 3073.88s]  you'll wake up and you have a ceiling fan. No, I don't. Well, that's weird. That's not my room,
[3073.88s -> 3082.33s]  but it is. I don't have a ceiling fan. Bizarre. Someone said, Vinny, have you ever seen your phone
[3082.33s -> 3088.89s]  in your dreams? You know what? That's fucking weird, because I'm on my phone like all the time,
[3088.89s -> 3094.41s]  as most of us are, have never once looked at my phone in a dream. Let me tell you something not
[3094.41s -> 3097.13s]  to do, but you're going to do it next time. And it's you're going to it's going to change
[3097.13s -> 3102.17s]  literally your entire life forever. If you're ever in a dream and you know, I feel like I don't want
[3102.17s -> 3108.07s]  to say this because it sucks. Okay. If you're in a dream and you're in like kind of lucid dreaming,
[3108.07s -> 3111.59s]  and people, people in my chat know this, but I might be scaring people in yours.
[3112.23s -> 3120.55s]  Okay. Well, look in a mirror. Go find a mirror and look in it. It is. But are you, you're inventing
[3120.55s -> 3126.63s]  the mirror. Yeah, because your brain does not understand mirrors when you are asleep. So when
[3126.63s -> 3133.35s]  you look at a mirror, it's your subconscious trying to recreate a full mirror in your head.
[3134.15s -> 3139.96s]  And it has so much trouble doing it that you will look at yourself in a mirror and it'll be this
[3139.96s -> 3146.60s]  weird, like eyeless, like demon person that's looking back at you and like their proportions
[3146.60s -> 3152.02s]  are all wrong and weird and shit. It really is like AI trying to make a person. It's like that
[3152.02s -> 3158.86s]  episode of Star Trek when the holodeck can't compute the data fast enough. It's true. Yeah,
[3158.94s -> 3165.98s]  that's such a good way to put it. Um, if you, uh, hold a, oh, sorry. I have like three headphones.
[3166.78s -> 3174.10s]  That's okay. Three headphones. How many years do you have? Well, I've, you know,
[3174.10s -> 3180.46s]  look at my AI generated face. I got like four years. Oh, okay. I don't think I've ever even
[3180.46s -> 3185.98s]  looked at a mirror in a fucking dream. I think the most, I know I've seen myself in dreams,
[3185.98s -> 3191.90s]  but like from a third person perspective, but I, for me, it's more, more location-based. Like I
[3191.90s -> 3198.82s]  keep going to weird post-apocalyptic versions of places. I already know they're not like fallout.
[3198.82s -> 3203.46s]  They're just wrong. They're just wrong. And I keep going back to them. Like once every month,
[3203.46s -> 3210.10s]  I go back to this weird mall that has a PF Chang's type Chinese food place and like a flea market.
[3210.74s -> 3216.82s]  Really? And I don't buy, I never buy anything. And it's just anxiety dream. So it's so weird.
[3216.90s -> 3224.94s]  Yeah. So my dreams are more location-based, but I've had plenty of, um, I was, uh, do you ever
[3224.94s -> 3230.62s]  keep a dream journal? I, you know, I used to, I used to, I got really into it for a little while,
[3230.62s -> 3234.94s]  but then I ran into the problem that you probably run into too, or maybe you have,
[3236.06s -> 3242.06s]  you will wake up after a dream and you're so tired and you're like, I need to write this down,
[3242.06s -> 3246.70s]  but I don't give a shit at all. I'm going back to bed. I'm tired. Yeah.
[3248.33s -> 3252.41s]  That's, that's the thing that happens to me with music. So I wake up with, with songs,
[3252.41s -> 3257.85s]  like some of my songs come from dreams and I have to like hum them into my phone and I've lost a
[3257.85s -> 3263.45s]  number of ideas. Cause I was just too tired. I was like, fuck it. But I did have, um, a dream
[3263.45s -> 3269.05s]  journal and I was telling my chat when I was taking melatonin a lot, I was having the most
[3269.05s -> 3272.73s]  bizarre fucking dreams. I had one, one dream that I was hanging out with Martin Scorsese,
[3272.73s -> 3281.30s]  but he was a stick insect and he was like, you know, I know you like my movies, but you know,
[3281.30s -> 3287.54s]  I'm a stick bug. So there's no more like, all right. Thanks. Mr. Scorsese. That sounds like,
[3287.54s -> 3294.66s]  like a Rick and Morty routine. Yes. Yeah. That's like a Rick and Morty like episode.
[3297.78s -> 3300.74s]  Oh, thank you. Scorsese stick bug for the advice. Right. Like that's,
[3300.74s -> 3305.38s]  that's a Rick and Morty routine. Yeah. Uh, thanks. Thanks. Mr. Scorsese stick bug.
[3305.38s -> 3310.10s]  That was really cool. Yeah. Mr. Scorsese stick bug. You're the man. Whoa. Scorsese. I love your
[3310.10s -> 3318.04s]  movies. Love your movies. Yeah. I think I just went, I had a lot of, a lot of good ones.
[3320.06s -> 3324.36s]  Have you watched the new Rick and Morty season? Yeah. I had, how'd you feel about it?
[3325.00s -> 3335.37s]  It's all right. I, it's all right. Very incest-y. Yeah. A lot of that. A lot of that.
[3338.34s -> 3344.34s]  My chat's like, what? I mean, just watch it. There's like two episodes with that topic.
[3345.59s -> 3351.75s]  I mean, it's pretty good. It's not like season two good, but it's, it's okay. Some of it was good.
[3351.75s -> 3355.43s]  I think honestly, the first couple of seasons of Rick and Morty I thought were actually very good.
[3356.73s -> 3362.17s]  Yeah. I agree. Memes aside, I made myself look like such a tool because I was so into it.
[3363.13s -> 3369.61s]  But yeah, but like people, okay. Like Family Guy, right? Like Family Guy was just like funny for
[3369.61s -> 3383.75s]  the first like four or five seasons, right? Six seasons. Yeah. Got into it. I mean, I didn't get
[3383.75s -> 3387.75s]  into it. I just, you know, watched it. It was a thing that was, well, you have to remember too,
[3387.75s -> 3390.39s]  this is something really important that I think a lot of people don't really understand about
[3390.39s -> 3397.35s]  like Rick and Morty, right? Adult, it's not, it's adult swim. Adult swim for a very, very long time
[3397.35s -> 3401.83s]  was like, just didn't have that new thing that they didn't have very many shows.
[3403.27s -> 3408.15s]  There was no shows that were coming out from adult swim that were like big hits, big deals.
[3408.15s -> 3414.39s]  No. Yeah. That was the first one in a long fucking time. Yeah. They were doing a lot of reruns.
[3414.39s -> 3421.82s]  Like there was like, yeah, Family Guy, a lot of Aqua Teen, stuff like that. Yeah. Well, I also,
[3421.82s -> 3425.58s]  that, you know, I, I will stand, well, I didn't really talk about it, but have you seen Smiling
[3425.58s -> 3431.82s]  Friends? Yeah. Love Smiling Friends. That's fucking phenomenal, right? Yeah. Awesome. And like the
[3431.82s -> 3437.34s]  anti Rick and Morty in a way too, cause it's so simple and it's so like gag based, but weirdly
[3437.34s -> 3445.13s]  smart. Yeah. I think it's great. I love that show. Every single episode of that show has been like,
[3445.13s -> 3452.63s]  wow, this is just clever and funny. Yeah. I I've I'm dying to voice a slug that gets stepped on
[3453.27s -> 3458.07s]  like as a site gag. Or I'm just like, oh, and then I get stepped on and that's, that's the gag.
[3460.23s -> 3469.77s]  I'll be really happy with that. You need to be a stink bug, Bill. That's fine. Oh,
[3469.77s -> 3478.68s]  this is one of those long levels. That's all good. The, uh, the turrets make this one good.
[3479.32s -> 3487.03s]  I'm just going to start tossing them. All right. Oh, with this water here, I've been bad at these.
[3491.11s -> 3495.19s]  Jermbo, I have one more question for you, actually. I have a meaning to ask you. Ask away.
[3495.19s -> 3501.40s]  Ask away. All right. Um, how are you? Did you finish breath of the wild or did you?
[3501.40s -> 3507.88s]  No, I am still going. Did you enjoy your play time so far? It's phenomenal. It's phenomenal.
[3507.88s -> 3513.80s]  It's phenomenal. Uh, no, yeah, it's great. Cool. Yeah. I'm happy to hear that. I'm glad you like it.
[3514.52s -> 3518.68s]  Uh, I honestly, it's just, um, all the traveling I've been doing and then getting sick is just
[3518.68s -> 3524.73s]  kind of, I really wanted to get back and just start screaming again. Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like
[3524.73s -> 3531.61s]  you've had a busy couple, a couple, uh, months. It's been, it's been busy. Yeah. We've got a bunch
[3531.61s -> 3540.28s]  of projects coming to working on trying to stay busy. I, I need to throw a grenade at that guy.
[3540.28s -> 3546.49s]  I think we might be in trouble here. Um, yeah. Use your ultimate. I think you got it.
[3548.52s -> 3552.20s]  Did it work? I don't know. Just get them in, get them in there.
[3552.20s -> 3559.26s]  Mary, get them in. You got it. You got it. I should have been focused more on the game.
[3559.26s -> 3569.54s]  That's my fault. Ask him about the Battleaxe dodging stream. Please swim. I guess I haven't
[3569.54s -> 3579.03s]  played this game in like six months. Uh, oh, the Battleaxe. Yeah. Um, I mean, people are talking
[3579.03s -> 3585.11s]  shit about how we're not very good at this game, but it doesn't really matter because, um, I can
[3585.11s -> 3590.86s]  dodge a Battleaxe in real life and I'm going to. I don't understand this. What's happening?
[3590.86s -> 3600.54s]  That's exactly the response I'm looking for. Let's leave it at that. Uh, you, you don't,
[3600.54s -> 3608.38s]  do me a favor. Don't die. We like having you around and, uh, yeah, just have fun.
[3609.94s -> 3614.66s]  It's actually really funny. The, whenever I tell somebody about this, it's like a person,
[3614.66s -> 3618.34s]  like a personal friend or a streamer or something. I get that same response of like,
[3621.02s -> 3624.86s]  everything good? Like this is good, right? Like it's not, you know, you doing this for real?
[3625.70s -> 3633.10s]  I'm like, no, it's going to be fun. Just like if I'm here, if you need me though,
[3635.16s -> 3638.76s]  everyone's like, dude, you're not going to like really dodge a Dax, man. Like,
[3638.76s -> 3644.92s]  right. This is like a funny joke. I'm just like, why don't you fucking tune in? I mean,
[3644.92s -> 3648.60s]  I'm going to tune in now that you've said it, but I'm, I'm worried. Like I'm, I'm,
[3649.16s -> 3661.82s]  you know, I'm worried now. I'm going to be fine. Don't worry. I'm going to be fine. Also, uh,
[3661.82s -> 3670.57s]  Jerma, you have to join the new lobby. Oh shit. All good. We, we're very close to fighting Chorizo.
[3670.57s -> 3676.01s]  I think we are, right? Yeah. We're not too far off. Uh, Newt, can you also, uh, fuck off?
[3677.67s -> 3682.87s]  Are we great? That was so mean. No, no, they're, they're my friend. Newt is great. Newt's a good
[3682.87s -> 3690.78s]  friend. No, it's going to be, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be a fun event
[3690.78s -> 3694.86s]  stream. It's going to be fun. It's not going to be, there's going to be fun activities and
[3694.86s -> 3703.06s]  don't worry, it's going to be fun. Okay. If I have to do a eulogy for you at any point on my stream,
[3704.73s -> 3714.06s]  I'm just going to be upset. So be like, you know what? I met him at PAX one year.
[3715.35s -> 3722.20s]  We, we, it was cold. We walked around. It was cold. It was very cold. He was a nice lad and
[3722.20s -> 3727.40s]  that was a good time. We liked, we liked to bust ghosts and that'll be like, I'll be like,
[3727.40s -> 3731.96s]  we'll miss him. But he just, he had the desire to get chopped in half by a battle axe.
[3732.76s -> 3736.04s]  No, I just got to prove to everybody that like I've got the physical capabilities that people
[3736.04s -> 3744.44s]  just don't understand. I mean, I'll do like, I'll do like a jump, I'll do like a jump or like a,
[3744.44s -> 3750.92s]  like a cartwheel or something on camera. Uh, and like I jumped up on, uh, on a chair on name,
[3750.92s -> 3754.78s]  your price. And everyone was like, Holy shit. And I'm just like, okay. Yeah. So do I have to,
[3754.78s -> 3767.56s]  how many more of these do I have to do? I mean, some people just post videos of them like doing
[3767.56s -> 3775.13s]  athleticism, you know, like, like on a couch or something, like, you know, like not actually
[3775.13s -> 3779.13s]  dodging a battle axe. You know, what's funny that you mentioned this right now, there are tons of
[3779.13s -> 3785.05s]  people who are incredibly athletic, putting up like parkour videos of like an amazing athleticism.
[3785.77s -> 3791.13s]  Uh huh. I jumped up on a chair on, on a show and I'm like, I can dodge an axe.
[3794.57s -> 3803.82s]  What? That, that's like my barometer here. That's good. That's a nice, that's a nice logic. Um,
[3803.82s -> 3810.54s]  just, yeah, I'll tune in for that. I don't have a hard date for it yet. Still trying to plan a
[3810.54s -> 3817.26s]  few things around it as well as maybe another show too. So sure. Yeah. I can imagine planning
[3817.26s -> 3827.99s]  a few things around it. The will, you know, the suit. The suit. Yeah. What's this thing?
[3827.99s -> 3832.71s]  You want it like, you know, you want it to be buried in a double breasted suit. Like that's
[3832.71s -> 3837.43s]  important if you're chopped up. Whoa. Yeah. I think I got, I think we just got killed by the
[3837.43s -> 3846.04s]  same thing. No, no, no. We're not dead yet. We're not dead yet. Oh, who's still alive? Is it you?
[3846.04s -> 3850.28s]  I'm alive. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm going to get you guys back. We should be like together, right?
[3851.80s -> 3857.91s]  Here. I'm going to, I'm going to get you guys back. Nice. Oh my God. What an absolute save that was.
[3859.21s -> 3870.14s]  All right. Now we just got to get a couple more. Oh my God. Just need a couple more.
[3870.86s -> 3878.52s]  All right. I'm down. We. Oh, all right. It was a good, it was a good try. All right. So this next
[3878.52s -> 3884.31s]  one here. So here's what we're going to do for this next one. You and I concentrate are only allowed
[3884.31s -> 3893.67s]  to talk about the video game and we have to call out video game information. Cool. Okay. Yeah. We
[3893.67s -> 3908.28s]  died on wave one. People are laughing at us. Yeah. Yeah. Oh boy. I lost rank from that one. My, um,
[3909.34s -> 3914.46s]  my friends are, I'm sorry, hacker. You lost rank. I'm so sorry. Oh wait, that's bad. That's actually
[3914.46s -> 3926.17s]  not good for your friend. I think hacker left. Oh no. Friendship only goes so far when de-ranking.
[3927.13s -> 3932.09s]  Oh no, she's back. All right. All right. All right. Okay. I was actually like hilarious. I
[3932.09s -> 3938.20s]  felt really bad about that. Yeah, me too. Let me make sure this is nice and pushed in.
[3939.56s -> 3948.78s]  Okay. Here we go. All right. Okay. We're now landing on the battlefield. All right.
[3949.58s -> 3964.07s]  I have entered my squid form. Yep. Just trying to get a paint everywhere so we can
[3964.63s -> 3972.84s]  clear on the side. Yep. I am attacking a thing with a metal umbrella and depositing eggs.
[3976.39s -> 4002.17s]  UFO by me. UFO down. Good. Snake over there. Snake dead. Throwing eggs. Tower. Grenade out.
[4003.05s -> 4011.43s]  Chet, this is not an E3 commentary track. Sorry. Retrieving egg. Throwing egg. This is not an E3
[4011.43s -> 4019.48s]  commentary track. E3 commentary track, we would add like way more words here. And then call each
[4019.48s -> 4023.88s]  other broski. Yeah. Like you're, yeah, you're forgetting to add like the extra like three or
[4023.88s -> 4033.96s]  four words per sentence. Right. So if you, if you were wanting to say, uh, like, uh, eggs here,
[4034.52s -> 4039.67s]  instead of being like, Hey, eggs by me, you'd say, Hey, eggs over here. Seven o'clock,
[4040.55s -> 4046.15s]  seven o'clock eggs, retrieving eggs, throwing them. All right. That's frosty. Oh yeah. Be like
[4046.15s -> 4055.78s]  eggs over here. Gnarly bro. You forget to add like the last like couple of words. I'll try to
[4055.78s -> 4059.78s]  remember. I mean, I would, I would call that unbelievable. That's a 100% higher than what
[4059.78s -> 4069.46s]  we needed. You know what? If we just act like E3 people, definitely real people. And we call
[4069.46s -> 4076.23s]  out gameplay. We double what we need. That's how good we are. I know everyone makes that joke,
[4076.23s -> 4082.79s]  right? About like the E3. But why wouldn't they just record people just playing the game? Like
[4082.79s -> 4086.15s]  just why don't just record like some of the devs just like playing it and like having fun.
[4087.99s -> 4090.79s]  Yeah. I mean, the devs definitely not like random people, but yeah,
[4091.83s -> 4102.44s]  yeah. Like get the devs who are best at speaking like the top four. Anyway, we're sorry. Throwing
[4102.44s -> 4106.20s]  egg. They really don't even need to be like, just, just hang out and just play it right. Like,
[4107.00s -> 4111.64s]  I don't think people really need to hear like, oh man, that's what me and my squad's going to
[4111.64s -> 4115.48s]  sound like. Just play the game. You know what I mean? And this is what happens when I fucking talk.
[4116.44s -> 4121.08s]  Yep. All right. I'll be retrieving you momentarily. Thank you, hacker. I appreciate that.
[4121.08s -> 4128.76s]  We're going to get you back up. All right. Big lad this way. We're going to take them down.
[4129.64s -> 4140.44s]  Tango's down. Snake about to be down. Snake down. Oh, thank you. You saved me. Thank you.
[4141.88s -> 4157.14s]  Watch out. Big UFO. I honestly don't even know what this does. What is fucking happening? Unleash?
[4157.86s -> 4176.34s]  Did I do it? Any more eggs? There's a couple, but I think, yeah, we're good. We almost doubled again.
[4176.34s -> 4183.34s]  That's pretty good. Someone said never played Splatoon. What is happening? We are eliminating
[4183.58s -> 4194.74s]  tangos and retrieving eggs and putting them into receptacles. So what this, uh, the splat umbrella
[4195.93s -> 4199.85s]  is that does the umbrella do damage or is just a shield when it launches out? Um, it does damage.
[4199.85s -> 4212.90s]  You should use it like a shotgun, but if you need a shield, you can hold it. Oh my God. Shit. But I
[4212.90s -> 4250.38s]  had it. Snake to our right. Oh boy. What? Splatted by big shot. All right. We're okay. Yep. It's the
[4250.38s -> 4278.38s]  dolphin thing. Okay. Damn. That took a while. Power over here by me. Okay. We're almost at
[4278.38s -> 4286.46s]  quota. Yeah, we got this one guy with a laser beam. Get out of here. Yeah. I hate those things.
[4293.30s -> 4303.74s]  Come on. Come on. Here we go. All right. All right. It's chorizo timing. So what's the
[4303.74s -> 4310.71s]  strategy here? The trick here is usually you want to kill bosses as fast as possible and then throw
[4310.71s -> 4315.27s]  the eggs at him. But it also helps to have someone shoot him a little bit or like, so
[4315.83s -> 4321.67s]  you want to kind of, I think the best strategy is to divide between bosses and eggs and actually
[4321.67s -> 4325.59s]  shooting. Okay. Uh, chorizo himself, but it doesn't, it's not overly effective.
[4326.71s -> 4335.14s]  So we should just ignore him and just kill bosses and shit. That's the big strategy. Yeah. That's
[4335.14s -> 4349.50s]  the main one. I think I have no audio. Wait, can you hear me? I can hear you with nothing else.
[4350.23s -> 4379.16s]  Okay. Cool. I still can't hear anything. Why halfway halfway. There's some eggs down here too.
[4380.63s -> 4386.23s]  Okay. We got those eggs. Oh God. Oh God. That's getting crazy. Um, be sure to use your special.
[4386.23s -> 4401.43s]  If you have one term, the wrong. All right. Unleash the water. Nari, help me. Okay.
[4412.26s -> 4420.50s]  Damn. I don't know what that special does. So you charge up booyahs and then you bomb.
[4421.46s -> 4426.26s]  That's it's just a nuke basically. Yeah. I was just like tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap,
[4426.26s -> 4438.09s]  tap, there you. Hit R right? Um, yeah, pretty much. I beat him once, frankly, like one time. Um,
[4438.97s -> 4444.66s]  how are you feeling by the way? I feel good. I'm fine. Do you want to play a little more
[4444.66s -> 4448.02s]  or I don't know if I'll have time to go for another chorizo. I want to make dinner
[4448.02s -> 4450.90s]  because I, all this chorizo talk is making me hungry. Oh I thought you, for a second.
[4450.90s -> 4454.58s]  I thought you said you were making chorizo. So you like. I don't want it now, but.
[4455.14s -> 4457.85s]  Well, I can take I can go on my own, too
[4458.45s -> 4460.16s]  Okay, so how about this?
[4460.16s -> 4466.52s]  We'll do we'll do a couple more and then when I feel my stomach starts it, you know eat at my stomach lining
[4467.08s -> 4469.25s]  I'll let you know. Yeah
[4469.25s -> 4475.40s]  Hey look this this the whole point of me being on screen today is to see if I can make sure I can be the sus guy
[4475.40s -> 4479.79s]  Tomorrow, that's a lot to live up to man. I know
[4481.55s -> 4487.11s]  Like joking aside though, how does it feel that that sus guy thing has like spread far beyond
[4487.75s -> 4489.25s]  Like you as a human
[4489.25s -> 4496.17s]  Well, let's see how much money I make tomorrow. I hate my laugh. That's cool, man
[4501.00s -> 4508.28s]  That's great. That's great. All right. Okay. Hey, you know DMV in like a few days and we'll talk we'll talk
[4510.85s -> 4516.33s]  If you Nari, I guess do one more with us and then we'll get Sin City in here just to rotate out
[4517.17s -> 4519.91s]  Thanks, Nari
[4519.91s -> 4525.86s]  Appreciate it. Yeah, the the one thing I have that has kind of I mean a couple things
[4526.38s -> 4530.98s]  Have had a little weird reach but the main one is me saying the word spin in a funny voice
[4531.82s -> 4538.40s]  That one was weird places that it just like like if there's a tick-tock of something spinning. They usually overdub my
[4539.32s -> 4542.07s]  my voice
[4542.07s -> 4549.78s]  Really? I feel like yeah, I probably heard it. It's just I'm sorry to do this everybody, but especially Jerma's audience
[4549.78s -> 4554.26s]  I apologize, but spin that I think I've actually heard that before
[4554.78s -> 4557.40s]  Yeah, it's stupid
[4559.22s -> 4565.72s]  Whole day. Sure. I'm so sorry. I've had like a bunch of cold medicine today. I'm sorry. Okay
[4574.58s -> 4586.44s]  Someone just said you're that guy. I don't I don't know. Am I who am I really? I don't even know
[4586.72s -> 4591.16s]  You actually know what I could do after this. I could probably just go right to breath of the wild play for a little bit
[4591.80s -> 4594.36s]  Whenever you're uh, I think you've had enough of this platoon
[4595.16s -> 4597.56s]  That's cool. How long do you usually stream for anyway? Um
[4599.24s -> 4600.44s]  Typically
[4600.44s -> 4601.72s]  somewhere around
[4601.72s -> 4605.29s]  Five to seven hours depending like four and a half to seven
[4605.99s -> 4609.66s]  Okay. Yeah, you got me. I do four
[4610.30s -> 4615.46s]  Yeah, I mean it was like sweet spot. I think I used to do like four
[4617.30s -> 4620.06s]  But I started streaming a lot less
[4620.54s -> 4626.44s]  So you know, yeah, how did I even die? I don't know what happened
[4629.22s -> 4639.44s]  Gotcha. Thank you. I think for me like a sweet spot at this point is like six hours and that's like what twice a week
[4640.32s -> 4642.56s]  Once a week, I mean it like two or three
[4643.16s -> 4645.72s]  Two or three. Yeah
[4645.72s -> 4651.54s]  Sometimes more sometimes less
[4652.90s -> 4658.86s]  I'm doing three a week for like four hours each time usually but I also do on my
[4659.18s -> 4661.10s]  One like in the mornings when I wake up
[4661.10s -> 4665.70s]  I usually do like I record like an hour or two of a game. I just I'm interested in and
[4666.30s -> 4673.34s]  That oh god and that's uploaded like pre-recorded on my youtube channel. So it's not live, but I basically do the same shit
[4673.34s -> 4676.40s]  I'm doing now. Yeah, and it's it's been really good for me because I get I
[4677.04s -> 4680.98s]  Feel like I feel better as a person when I upload something every day
[4681.92s -> 4686.22s]  It's bizarre. I don't know why I feel that way, but it's nice to have like a new upload every day
[4687.56s -> 4693.88s]  I you know YouTube is one of those things that I probably gonna start to get a little more involved in as
[4695.04s -> 4697.04s]  Time goes on here
[4697.04s -> 4701.33s]  But you started on YouTube no
[4701.39s -> 4705.27s]  Yeah, but I mean but as of like the last few years
[4705.27s -> 4709.99s]  I've been pretty much only twitch with like the second channel having highlights and stuff, right?
[4711.07s -> 4714.92s]  But I don't know. I have no idea
[4715.80s -> 4725.53s]  Dude, you wanna know what I was so pissed off about
[4726.29s -> 4728.29s]  What's that? So?
[4728.81s -> 4734.73s]  The the Xbox I play like I usually just kind of chill and play Xbox on the couch and I'm just kind of hanging out
[4735.73s -> 4737.73s]  They have like a record feature
[4738.17s -> 4740.17s]  Right. It's like oh you can record a clip
[4740.41s -> 4745.13s]  it's I'm really like funny shit has happened in a lot of these just random things that I'm doing just lying on a couch and
[4745.89s -> 4747.89s]  I didn't know this until pretty recently
[4748.61s -> 4755.11s]  But Xbox fucking auto deletes all the shit that you ever record unless you put it on to like a hard drive
[4755.61s -> 4757.61s]  I was like, excuse me
[4757.77s -> 4759.77s]  All my funny shit is gone
[4760.25s -> 4763.45s]  No, I didn't know that
[4764.05s -> 4768.57s]  Yeah, you have to like up so you were planning on taking all of it and uploading it like eventually
[4768.57s -> 4773.47s]  I was gonna do like a video. I was gonna make a video like on the shit that I was playing
[4777.13s -> 4787.00s]  Like what games are you playing on Xbox though? Um, so believe it or not. I was playing a lot of Shadow of War. Oh
[4788.56s -> 4791.04s]  Lord of the Rings middle earth. Yeah
[4791.76s -> 4799.82s]  Which that game is so fun. So funny. Yeah, I've never played it and I'm a huge fucking Lord of the Rings fail
[4799.88s -> 4805.00s]  God, I'm a big Lord of the Rings nerd. Really? You've never played shadow never played it. No
[4806.00s -> 4807.36s]  any
[4807.36s -> 4812.06s]  Yeah, I know what you're doing like tomorrow, right?
[4815.34s -> 4818.58s]  It's that game is 100% content
[4819.34s -> 4820.50s]  Okay
[4820.50s -> 4828.45s]  Like that game is just content. Okay, and it's just is it good for a Tolkien fan too, or is it like yo, yeah
[4829.89s -> 4832.26s]  It's I mean, we're not really
[4832.58s -> 4835.10s]  We got we got beat pretty bad. It's all right. We just like tang would chat
[4836.54s -> 4839.10s]  That's probably one of the funniest games ever
[4839.22s -> 4841.62s]  I don't want to spoil anything for you
[4841.62s -> 4847.90s]  But like the amount of wacky just absolutely wacky shit that could happen in those games is just is a record breaker
[4848.38s -> 4852.16s]  All right
[4852.16s -> 4854.24s]  Am I getting bad chested for saying content?
[4858.62s -> 4861.90s]  Hacker I'm so sorry that we are decreasing your rank
[4864.26s -> 4868.38s]  You don't have to continue playing with us hacker. Yeah, we don't have to win enough to drag you down
[4869.06s -> 4873.94s]  Like I'm gonna do maybe like two or three more, you know, cuz I'm enjoying
[4874.62s -> 4881.90s]  Hanging out with Jerma as well hang on to but I also do not want to ruin hackers rank because hackers like
[4882.46s -> 4886.67s]  Pro yeah, you can only hard carry so much, right?
[4887.27s -> 4894.94s]  Well, okay. I know I go content. I say that's not I what I mean by that is if you've ever thought of us
[4895.50s -> 4902.39s]  If you've ever thought about screaming that game or like making a video on that game. It's just it's it's so good
[4902.39s -> 4905.09s]  It's so fun. There's so many things to do. I
[4907.72s -> 4909.72s]  Felt that way about birth of the wild
[4909.92s -> 4914.96s]  Just because it's like just all these wacky physics situations that can you can get yourself into
[4915.40s -> 4920.66s]  But I know that like the nemesis system has the you know, that's where the fun is, right? Oh, yeah
[4921.32s -> 4928.55s]  Okay. Okay. This there is just something that hits so hard when you play that game and I
[4928.99s -> 4930.99s]  Don't want to say anything cuz like, you know quite it
[4931.47s -> 4934.39s]  Okay. Yeah, that's a good suggestion. I'll keep it in mind
[4934.85s -> 4937.23s]  But I'm just gonna mute and say it to my stream
[4937.81s -> 4942.34s]  Okay, but when you play that game and you just kind of
[4943.30s -> 4947.78s]  Walking around like looking for like the starter. Well, shirma is is muted or has muted me
[4947.78s -> 4951.78s]  He probably can still hear me in one of his three headphones, but I'm true. I could
[4952.94s -> 4958.22s]  so when you're just like walking around looking for the start of a mission and all of a sudden the game just takes control and
[4958.62s -> 4962.02s]  Pans over and zooms in on a guy that's just like a ranger
[4962.48s -> 4968.92s]  Oh, you thought you could kill me but I'm back and I'm ready to eat your blood or like it's it's so fucking funny and
[4969.56s -> 4975.08s]  Then like a caragor bites him and kills him in one hit. It's just like it's absolute fucking zany nonsense
[4978.69s -> 4988.40s]  I'm back. Okay, so I'll take your recommendation and when I have a little like time where I have like, you know
[4988.40s -> 4992.40s]  Some some gaps in my schedule. I'm gonna check out that game
[4993.12s -> 4996.21s]  Yeah, I don't know if it's completely
[4996.91s -> 5001.43s]  Canon Lord of the Rings. I mean the story is good enough. I think I
[5002.27s -> 5006.83s]  Don't think it's fully canon. But after rings of power, I'll probably be like this is amazing
[5008.59s -> 5014.53s]  Why did this get ran over? Oh, yeah, the glow flies. I this is the worst one
[5015.81s -> 5021.53s]  Hacker you left at the exact right moment. I know this is like the word guarantee. This is just a nightmare
[5022.35s -> 5050.22s]  Pause it pause it. What's the time? Did it work? I pressed it
[5052.53s -> 5056.01s]  You know, there's something about audio coming through one headphone like
[5057.53s -> 5073.33s]  I feel like I'm playing with like like my eyes closed. We did it kind of we just need to live now
[5074.15s -> 5075.79s]  Somebody stay alive
[5075.79s -> 5085.85s]  Wow, who did it? I don't know. I said well sin got us back up sin city. So thank you since it nice job
[5086.63s -> 5091.27s]  All right, Jeremiah, I have a chat member named colostomy bagel. Okay, I wanted you to know that
[5096.63s -> 5099.22s]  That's all oh
[5099.22s -> 5102.34s]  Here's another question. Do you like the Sims? Do you like city builders?
[5103.06s -> 5105.24s]  Um, I played
[5105.28s -> 5113.12s]  What the city's skylines, right? Yeah, that was fun, but I'm too stupid for it. I really can't do it. Okay
[5113.80s -> 5116.82s]  All right fair enough
[5116.82s -> 5119.80s]  Honestly, like I I want to play the sims 4 again on screen
[5120.24s -> 5125.40s]  That's another game that just has so much weird shit that happens all the time. I'll probably never have played a sims game
[5126.02s -> 5128.80s]  am I just like
[5128.80s -> 5130.49s]  like
[5130.49s -> 5134.25s]  me capping my my channel by not playing sims and like
[5134.85s -> 5137.97s]  I mean, but just out of mortar. Yeah, you could start in the very beginning
[5139.25s -> 5144.19s]  There's like a hundred years of video games that you could play just by playing the sims franchise in a row
[5144.65s -> 5149.19s]  You would love the sims too
[5149.33s -> 5157.31s]  It's not there like a thousand dollars worth of like DLC for the new one though
[5157.31s -> 5161.19s]  Yeah, and I I I could be wrong and this might be a completely wrong take
[5161.55s -> 5164.75s]  But when you look at that list of expansions to buy
[5165.55s -> 5170.97s]  Mm-hmm. I tell me if I'm wrong, but I could be wrong a chatter or you and everybody knows this
[5171.95s -> 5175.67s]  Like there's no just buy this all
[5177.27s -> 5181.73s]  There's no just like I want most of this there's no like bundles
[5181.73s -> 5185.67s]  You have to like you have to do it. You have to individually purchase every fucking expansion. Am I wrong?
[5186.63s -> 5192.75s]  There's like 30 different things and like I going to the checkout and like here's your credit card info
[5192.75s -> 5198.67s]  Buy this one thing or two things, right? You have to buy you to add each thing individually to your cart
[5199.95s -> 5205.09s]  On steam apparently, is it actually on steam you can do it. That's I don't know. That's what my chat saying
[5205.87s -> 5209.49s]  But then again chat has as we've mentioned before giving me bad advice
[5210.35s -> 5215.19s]  From time to time I wish they would do like a like a gold bundle like a platinum bundle or something
[5215.19s -> 5219.59s]  I mean why I there's like 50 expansions that have to add each one individually
[5220.39s -> 5226.79s]  That's a first-world problem. Oh
[5228.31s -> 5230.83s]  Boy, I have all this money burning a hole in my pocket
[5231.79s -> 5239.25s]  How do I buy more Sims content? I need adult babies expansion. Oh hell yeah adult diapers
[5240.29s -> 5245.20s]  How do I buy the nursing home expansion, please?
[5247.24s -> 5251.64s]  That is really such a good fucking non-concern it really is
[5251.64s -> 5258.44s]  I don't want to click a button individually and place it in what I want to buy all thousand dollars worth this right now
[5259.08s -> 5261.08s]  Wait, why can't I?
[5264.22s -> 5268.95s]  Do they do have some like weird stuff in that expansion list by the way
[5270.41s -> 5273.41s]  Is there clown stuff? I don't probably
[5274.19s -> 5278.76s]  All right, cuz I I kind of like clown stuff like that would be perfect
[5278.76s -> 5283.60s]  Yeah, I'm looking through it's just like oh like my first gerbil like what okay?
[5284.40s -> 5286.40s]  I'm we get
[5286.48s -> 5291.07s]  Come on one more, and then we live one more, and then we live we got this I
[5292.16s -> 5293.64s]  believe in us
[5293.64s -> 5296.84s]  Quota met now we live
[5299.87s -> 5301.87s]  Robin fucking bomb
[5310.30s -> 5314.08s]  Please we got this
[5314.88s -> 5316.88s]  Now picture this on higher difficulties
[5317.52s -> 5319.52s]  I feel like we're on the higher difficulty
[5319.84s -> 5325.93s]  We're not we just lost hacker. That's right. She's just that good
[5326.45s -> 5331.05s]  That's right. We did lose the best player
[5333.61s -> 5337.17s]  So getting we got double high tide okay? What's up, Joe?
[5337.17s -> 5340.49s]  I think somebody's asking if I'm gonna play Breath of Wild after this probably yeah
[5340.49s -> 5343.37s]  I'm as long as I still feel okay really I'll be all right
[5343.93s -> 5348.48s]  I'll do like
[5348.48s -> 5350.31s]  me see
[5350.31s -> 5352.07s]  How long we've been going for?
[5352.07s -> 5354.17s]  Yeah, it's not over in a half. It's all up to like one
[5354.69s -> 5359.19s]  Um I don't think we're gonna get chorizo for a while, so maybe I'll just do like one more. Yeah
[5359.97s -> 5363.37s]  Okay, I mean I did for those who that don't know I did just like
[5363.93s -> 5368.22s]  Send a message to Vinny being like hey. Do you want to stream today? Yeah?
[5368.94s -> 5373.80s]  I was like can you do it in an hour? Yeah, it was I listen man
[5373.80s -> 5376.20s]  I'm happy to do so we've been talking about doing this for a little while
[5376.20s -> 5382.16s]  So I'm happy we get the chance like collaborate, but I was actually recording a Star Fox mod
[5382.78s -> 5388.70s]  Like a Star Fox rom hack like I was about to hit record, and then you messaged me
[5388.70s -> 5391.40s]  And then I was like all right well that's gonna be put off till later
[5392.40s -> 5396.24s]  So no, it's all good. It's all good. I'm happy to do this. This is this is good
[5397.34s -> 5399.34s]  Yeah, and I'm sure we'll
[5399.90s -> 5405.50s]  See you again for the next couple of days whatever we do of the longest tomorrow or whatever we do more VR
[5406.02s -> 5410.02s]  That's gonna be coming also. It's gonna be fucked up. It's gonna be cool, but
[5410.64s -> 5414.84s]  Did you do among us VR in VR chat ever?
[5415.48s -> 5420.88s]  Yeah, I have never even opened the video game among us. I don't I don't even know what it is I
[5422.12s -> 5424.12s]  Swear to God I have no
[5425.64s -> 5431.02s]  That of all the things that you could have been known for outside of like a wider reach of the Internet
[5431.64s -> 5434.76s]  It's a game. You've never played. It's unbelievable no
[5435.68s -> 5437.68s]  And that's why it's tomorrow's one day only
[5438.58s -> 5444.17s]  Well, so here's the thing chat. There's a chance. I may do among us VR
[5444.17s -> 5447.37s]  I'm not sure because I have a studio day, and we're finishing up recording
[5449.57s -> 5452.11s]  Some stuff so I don't want to
[5452.47s -> 5457.19s]  Miss that and then there's other variables too like I you know if it's like a full server
[5457.19s -> 5460.43s]  I'm not gonna bully my way in you know what I mean, but at the same time
[5461.15s -> 5465.83s]  There's almost a 100% guarantee. I'm gonna do among us VR in the future if not tomorrow
[5466.61s -> 5470.61s]  Just to let my chat know because they've been asking for a while too. Oh fuck
[5473.02s -> 5475.26s]  Vinny you killed two of your teammates
[5476.06s -> 5479.46s]  What these hamburger fucking grill things pissing me off?
[5484.53s -> 5491.54s]  There's no pink. That's okay. We just gotta live now
[5493.34s -> 5495.34s]  fucking bad you know idea
[5495.46s -> 5501.77s]  Hey, Jeremiah. I don't want to like peek too far behind the curtain
[5501.77s -> 5506.85s]  But I want to ask you one very important question if you if you want to answer on stream or not that's fine
[5506.85s -> 5513.00s]  But is it difficult to hire clowns um actually kind of yeah
[5513.92s -> 5516.21s]  Okay
[5516.21s -> 5522.20s]  Although the thing is a lot of that you would hire to that's a clown a lot of times
[5522.72s -> 5524.80s]  They're they do a lot of other stuff
[5525.44s -> 5532.90s]  So some people have their side gig well. It's not it's just like a performance right performing. Yeah, and a lot of these
[5534.06s -> 5536.06s]  a lot of the more
[5536.16s -> 5541.36s]  They have like more than one thing so like oh, yeah, I need to there is a clown that I'm hiring a clown
[5541.36s -> 5542.76s]  You are a clown
[5542.76s -> 5547.12s]  No, you might be somebody that can be a clown, but you're also like a magician
[5547.12s -> 5552.70s]  You're also like a fucking like incredibly talented like contortionist and like dancer
[5553.08s -> 5557.68s]  Right, it's not just like oh you are something yeah, right
[5558.48s -> 5563.52s]  Yeah, I would imagine you'd need to if you're gonna be that kind of entertainer you have to diversify your portfolio
[5563.52s -> 5569.58s]  So you can get more work because I mean how often are people having clown baseball games, you know?
[5570.86s -> 5572.86s]  Not very often I would imagine
[5573.66s -> 5575.83s]  but yeah, it's
[5575.83s -> 5580.55s]  If you're looking for like a clown you should be looking for like almost like a performance group
[5580.55s -> 5586.11s]  Okay, for like a performer that is more hold on. I have to save somebody's life
[5587.31s -> 5588.72s]  Okay
[5588.72s -> 5597.19s]  Yeah, it's easier to find somebody that can do a clown if you need a clown rather than just searching for a
[5597.71s -> 5602.75s]  Young I need a just clown right like this is my life and identity is clown. Yeah
[5603.39s -> 5604.91s]  Okay
[5604.91s -> 5610.27s]  Also area to depends. I know there's a lot of cities that are a lot less in the performing arts
[5611.11s -> 5616.91s]  Yeah, so like Vegas is probably easier to get clown than New York City. Well, New York City's got like kind of everything
[5616.91s -> 5619.11s]  I feel like I feel like New York would be wouldn't be hard
[5619.75s -> 5621.63s]  Yeah, I
[5621.63s -> 5625.03s]  Mean we do have a store that specifically sells like clown outfits
[5626.01s -> 5631.44s]  So you do yeah, we do we do it's not it's like a costume shop
[5631.44s -> 5635.36s]  Oh, like it's just a massive costume shop and they have plenty of clown outfits
[5636.36s -> 5639.03s]  Because I had to me and my friend Mike
[5640.39s -> 5643.96s]  We were clowns for the back of one of our albums
[5644.82s -> 5647.57s]  We had to buy clown outfits like
[5648.25s -> 5649.85s]  six years ago
[5649.85s -> 5653.87s]  So yeah, there you can get them but I was invincible if I did that
[5654.65s -> 5665.26s]  Chat I'm not telling you why I may hire a clown
[5665.94s -> 5672.94s]  That's part of the fun. But you know, maybe one day it will come to fruition. Maybe it won't
[5673.82s -> 5678.16s]  Maybe I'm just clowning around. I feel like New York would be pretty easy
[5678.16s -> 5685.46s]  I mean you can hire like a lot of different types of entertainers
[5685.72s -> 5690.44s]  Yeah, New York's a big entertainment city. Yeah, we are. Yeah, we have everything
[5691.20s -> 5694.82s]  Holy what just happened? Who just Boo-Yah? Oh
[5696.50s -> 5698.74s]  It's getting tough. Where are you? I think
[5699.50s -> 5702.06s]  I'm here. So we may need to start
[5702.86s -> 5704.86s]  Yeah, I'll throw some ultimates
[5705.42s -> 5726.58s]  Damnit was busy boo-yahing. You got three. Oh my yes. There's plenty on the map. It's just impossible
[5727.78s -> 5733.08s]  To like get them over there right now. There's so many that are there we could still do it
[5733.70s -> 5737.47s]  We just need some depositors
[5737.73s -> 5744.02s]  Mary no, no, he was dead for a while. This is the worst platoon gameplay of all time
[5744.70s -> 5749.57s]  No, I played worse. Um, you need to kill the boss is closer to the basket. Yeah, that makes sense
[5749.89s -> 5753.69s]  Well, Jerma before I go out, I'll tell you one more little story
[5755.41s -> 5759.05s]  There's like a famous clown story I have about a stapler clown
[5759.05s -> 5766.24s]  Did you ever like see a performer who would have people staple money to their chests? No
[5766.96s -> 5769.77s]  You mean like I was at a bar
[5770.27s -> 5774.39s]  Yeah, like so I was at a bar one night and
[5775.71s -> 5780.91s]  Going back years ago and there was a clown who his whole act was, you know
[5780.91s -> 5786.15s]  They did sword swallowing and juggling and stuff and the cloud the usual clown stuff. It's kind of smelly
[5786.67s -> 5790.50s]  Like like he kind of stunk the place up. So he was like a smelly cloud
[5790.50s -> 5793.38s]  I don't know if that was part of the act but at one point
[5793.38s -> 5799.62s]  He said if anyone wants to I got a stapler here my lovely clown assistant will help you
[5799.62s -> 5801.62s]  I've got if you want
[5802.04s -> 5804.04s]  $10 you can staple it to my chest
[5804.28s -> 5808.92s]  You know for $50 you can staple it to my stomach for a hundred you can staple it to my
[5809.48s -> 5811.48s]  nether nether region what
[5812.68s -> 5814.68s]  Jerma I witnessed a clown's
[5815.40s -> 5816.76s]  You know
[5816.76s -> 5823.04s]  So wait, it's in so the so the idea here. The idea here is that yeah, it's like you that you're paying
[5823.04s -> 5826.96s]  That's like he keeps the money. That's like are you stapled to me? I keep it. Yes
[5827.50s -> 5831.78s]  Once it's stapled to him he has it and I don't think you'd want to touch it again after no
[5832.78s -> 5838.50s]  Just trying to get the service, you know what what he was doing the stick whatever it was, right? That's that's so
[5838.78s -> 5840.96s]  Somebody's he stapled it to his
[5841.50s -> 5847.97s]  Yeah, like his batwing he would batwing and he would let you staple it there, but it had to be like a hundred bucks
[5847.97s -> 5855.90s]  What is the batwing? Well, it's like kind of when like you stretch out
[5857.32s -> 5859.32s]  The skin and
[5859.72s -> 5866.75s]  It looks like a batwing like like Batman. So he would stretch it out for you
[5866.75s -> 5869.65s]  He would batwing it and then he would let you staple it
[5871.71s -> 5873.88s]  Like to that yeah
[5875.22s -> 5879.20s]  It's good living I guess so and somebody did this
[5879.74s -> 5883.26s]  Yeah, I watched it. It's real. I've seen it and Nari in fact in my chat
[5883.26s -> 5888.98s]  There's a video there are multiple videos of this clown or similar clowns that exists
[5890.14s -> 5891.58s]  I
[5891.58s -> 5898.10s]  Don't know why I'm telling you this German. I'm sorry, but I just thought like we're talking about clowns. Let me just yes
[5898.10s -> 5904.67s]  I felt like you needed to know because like so I'm trying to understand like the the how does this come up?
[5904.99s -> 5909.19s]  Like it was somebody did somebody like hire this person or was he just kind of like hey
[5909.19s -> 5911.19s]  You could staple shit to me for money
[5911.55s -> 5916.27s]  Yeah, so that's a weird thing because this bar I used to go to before it closed down
[5916.27s -> 5920.25s]  They just had like musicians usually just you know music but this night
[5920.43s -> 5925.47s]  I was there with friends and the clown was there and we were like what the fuck so
[5925.91s -> 5930.27s]  We see the act and he's like throwing the swords, and he's you know juggling
[5930.27s -> 5934.23s]  Okay, all right, and then about an hour later. He goes all right
[5934.75s -> 5938.30s]  now we're gonna close the doors and have some real fun and
[5939.12s -> 5940.92s]  then he
[5940.92s -> 5947.43s]  Like literally closed the doors and gave us his terms and conditions about like stapling money to him
[5948.23s -> 5950.23s]  What the fuck?
