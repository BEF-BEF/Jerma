[0.44s -> 9.86s]  Hey, good afternoon. Ah, it's it's evening. Never mind. Yeah, I'm here. It's really late. Yeah, it is
[12.42s -> 15.22s]  It ain't no time like the present to play Elden Ring
[22.31s -> 26.30s]  Elden Ring. Yeah, I uh, we streamed yesterday
[27.00s -> 29.00s]  When I say we I mean me
[29.53s -> 32.49s]  At the end of that stream. I said that Tuesday is what you probably could expect
[33.37s -> 35.26s]  but
[35.26s -> 39.02s]  Uh, I want I'm I want to go now. So we're doing it now
[41.56s -> 43.56s]  So we're very very early
[43.88s -> 47.66s]  Because i'm supposed to stream tomorrow, but i'm like, you know what? No streaming tonight
[48.38s -> 50.70s]  So it was very very early to tomorrow's stream
[51.50s -> 54.38s]  But this is a very late stream
[54.46s -> 56.46s]  starting at like 7 15
[56.70s -> 58.44s]  pacific
[58.44s -> 60.44s]  so I i'll tell you
[61.78s -> 62.74s]  I am
[62.74s -> 65.86s]  Makes sense if you're like, you know what dude? I don't know if I mean
[67.03s -> 69.03s]  I'm okay. I could probably be here for like an hour or two
[69.59s -> 73.03s]  That's all right. I don't okay. I don't think this is gonna be like a 10 hour stream
[73.51s -> 76.90s]  I'm just playing i'm just gonna jump in we're gonna play we're gonna hang out
[77.54s -> 80.58s]  Get some more progress done in the volcano manner
[83.59s -> 86.87s]  And look after four or five hours, let's figure it out. Whatever
[90.41s -> 92.65s]  You guys are all addicted. That's why you're here
[93.37s -> 96.60s]  Hey, well, you know
[96.60s -> 100.20s]  That's whatever if the game's fun and there's a bunch of people think it's fun
[100.98s -> 103.32s]  400,000 concurrent people still playing the game by the way
[106.47s -> 108.47s]  We're all here. So let's just hang out
[109.19s -> 114.57s]  Is this the guy that says Aaron?
[115.10s -> 116.95s]  well
[116.95s -> 121.86s]  It used to be kind of moved on from those kind of that kind of material
[122.66s -> 124.66s]  Moved on to an elden ring streamer
[125.24s -> 128.28s]  uh, so you're probably gonna get some elden ring kind of references and
[129.08s -> 133.43s]  I would appreciate it if those of you that are here now can say things instead of like aaron
[133.75s -> 137.67s]  You know like praise the sun and not maiden lists and you know that kind of thing
[138.39s -> 140.39s]  I changed my brand a little here
[141.53s -> 146.17s]  I would appreciate it. Nobody said like, you know, nobody said aaron anymore. We're trying to move on to other things
[147.13s -> 150.20s]  We're gonna move on to elden ring stuff
[150.95s -> 152.55s]  Aaron ring
[152.55s -> 156.06s]  All right. We're in the volcano manor. I do I really need an intro
[156.14s -> 159.50s]  We just I stopped streaming like less than 24 hours ago. So let's just keep going
[160.06s -> 165.10s]  What about doi doi doi? No, that's not that's not what we're doing anymore
[171.42s -> 172.30s]  please
[172.30s -> 176.26s]  I don't even know what that mean. I don't know how
[177.86s -> 179.22s]  I don't know how to do it
[179.22s -> 186.78s]  Just sit here for 20 more minutes talking about your old noises
[187.66s -> 191.02s]  You know how weird that is to think about? Oh man like
[191.90s -> 197.50s]  Those old jokes. Oh those jokes from you know years past those noises
[198.89s -> 202.81s]  They're not they're not even jokes, right? Like a lot of my old material
[203.77s -> 206.07s]  sound effects
[206.07s -> 208.65s]  the sound effects
[208.65s -> 210.89s]  Oh that classic germa 985 joke
[211.61s -> 215.45s]  Oh germa 985 was is a comedian. Yeah classic comedian
[216.09s -> 217.85s]  What's some of his material?
[217.85s -> 220.25s]  Oh, man, he's got this amazing routine
[220.81s -> 226.81s]  Where he sits there and are you ready? It's it's insane. He sit so he's sitting there and he goes
[231.06s -> 232.47s]  Yeah
[232.47s -> 235.42s]  Yeah, that's it. Does he do anything else?
[236.06s -> 240.50s]  Well, I mean his old stuff was like it's I mean, it's all right, but he did a dollhouse
[240.98s -> 246.74s]  Uh, he just did the dollhouse. He's got baseball coming up. But um, yeah, he used to make like noises
[248.95s -> 250.57s]  All right, man
[250.57s -> 254.97s]  So you're saying you're saying I should start watching the material from like 2017 and onward
[256.12s -> 258.12s]  Nah, maybe a little bit later
[258.12s -> 263.26s]  Maybe like 2018 2019 is when he stopped doing noises for content, but he still does it
[263.82s -> 268.60s]  Anyways, I like those noises and i'm gonna stick to them
[274.42s -> 282.12s]  Where we were we were here. Those noises were from like a month ago
[288.52s -> 291.48s]  You watch from spi nest onwards, right? Yeah
[294.74s -> 299.22s]  You do yoga. I can't do yoga. I can't my body physically can't move that way
[300.54s -> 303.42s]  You should respect the character. This character has been incredible
[303.72s -> 305.72s]  Respect the character
[305.90s -> 307.90s]  Respect the character. This character is amazing
[313.59s -> 315.75s]  All right. So last thing we did
[315.75s -> 318.71s]  All right. So last thing we did we we uh killed the boss that was in this room
[319.35s -> 322.31s]  I think there's a way I can go over here. Maybe
[323.77s -> 326.09s]  What is this? This is really late. Yeah, this is late night stream
[326.65s -> 331.88s]  I'm doing a late night at least maybe I don't know after like three or four hours
[331.88s -> 333.88s]  I just want to play and i'm not gonna play without you
[334.44s -> 337.10s]  Unless I do limb grave and i'm not doing limb grave another day
[340.04s -> 341.08s]  um
[341.08s -> 347.80s]  You know, I thought about oh man, like maybe i'll just go tomorrow and i'll do limb grave again today on my own on another guy
[348.12s -> 352.60s]  No
[352.60s -> 355.72s]  I stepped on this before the stream started so I think no it's here
[356.36s -> 361.00s]  Sorry played without you for 10 seconds before the stream started. Sorry. Sorry about that
[361.72s -> 368.89s]  We need a me strong stream
[370.41s -> 373.45s]  Maybe all right. Let's go. I this game. I love it. Let's go
[374.17s -> 385.06s]  a lot of candles
[385.06s -> 388.84s]  You know a thing next to the piano
[390.52s -> 392.52s]  the piano like object
[395.98s -> 400.70s]  Was that a good villain here? I just calmed it back
[406.10s -> 413.83s]  nothing over here
[413.83s -> 417.51s]  Resident sleeper. It's been the streamers been off for fucking five minutes
[421.32s -> 423.32s]  You know what? That's so funny. Like
[425.06s -> 428.02s]  You guys don't have any idea how much power you really hold
[430.46s -> 436.46s]  Like oh i'm just i'm just a i'm just a random viewer in a sea of people you have you hold a lot of power over
[436.62s -> 438.06s]  The people that are streaming
[438.06s -> 442.04s]  I'm telling you right now when a streamer looks over and sees resident sleeper
[442.52s -> 444.52s]  They have an internal panic attack
[444.94s -> 450.38s]  But they're like what's happening this person? Why is this person think my stream sucks? My stream's boring. Why what happened?
[450.54s -> 454.62s]  I need to do something. I gotta do something now. I gotta wake that person up. I gotta make like a joke
[454.70s -> 465.30s]  I gotta do something you hold a lot of power, but i'm gonna choose to ignore you. All right
[465.30s -> 467.30s]  This is what what is this like wacky?
[467.78s -> 470.82s]  Twisting hallway thing. Am I just walking in circles? There's nothing here
[471.54s -> 475.75s]  How can there be no items here?
[475.75s -> 478.79s]  None at all zero across this there's got to be a secret wall, right?
[479.35s -> 482.78s]  You gotta go back to your old your old material man
[485.64s -> 486.68s]  Ooh
[486.68s -> 492.28s]  All right, I can go that way. Yeah, dude. Your old material was way better
[495.35s -> 499.19s]  Wasn't there another way I could go? Hold on
[499.19s -> 501.19s]  Can I seriously isn't nothing here?
[501.83s -> 504.84s]  That feels impossible. But whatever
[504.92s -> 507.99s]  These are really romantic candles
[508.15s -> 515.82s]  No, it probably stinks up here
[515.82s -> 519.26s]  Uh, yeah, boss. I filled the room with the red candles like you wanted
[521.82s -> 523.98s]  gerry
[523.98s -> 525.80s]  You fucking idiot
[525.80s -> 531.16s]  Did you have to get the red cinnamon apple candle from yankee candle and put it in every room
[532.84s -> 535.88s]  We have to we're gonna have to fucking open the windows and not come back here for like a week
[536.36s -> 542.87s]  Which by the way, that's one of the most powerful. That's one of the most powerful of all the candles and I hate them
[544.68s -> 547.00s]  I I swear to god I can tell
[547.88s -> 551.24s]  I can tell when a neighbor lights one of those candles
[551.88s -> 555.43s]  It drives me crazy
[555.43s -> 561.03s]  Is that like cinnamon? It's like the fall cinnamon cider apple one. It's just like no
[561.11s -> 563.11s]  Yeah, I like it for like a second, but
[563.75s -> 565.75s]  I don't want to fill my whole neighborhood with that
[568.38s -> 569.34s]  wait
[569.34s -> 573.50s]  Take it to jump in the lava
[574.92s -> 576.60s]  What's my death count out right now?
[576.60s -> 583.38s]  What is it? I I don't what is it even at?
[585.99s -> 590.15s]  My under 500 deaths. I didn't even say it went too fast
[590.79s -> 592.31s]  How many deaths are there?
[592.31s -> 595.06s]  I don't have 700 deaths. No, I don't
[597.96s -> 602.17s]  493
[602.17s -> 603.78s]  Does anybody
[603.78s -> 607.70s]  Know how many times I died in securo or dark soul 3? All right, well i'm going down here
[608.42s -> 619.00s]  In here, I think I I don't think I died more than like 150 times in dark souls 3. It was like 200
[624.62s -> 629.78s]  Have I been in here?
[629.78s -> 631.78s]  Well shit, I guess not
[631.86s -> 636.01s]  Okay. Well
[636.01s -> 640.23s]  Go on here. How many was securo?
[642.71s -> 645.75s]  What the what the fuck? I was over there. Shit. All right, never mind
[646.97s -> 649.29s]  All right. I'm going back up. I'm going I walked in a circle
[649.93s -> 652.01s]  I locked in I literally walked in a circle
[655.89s -> 660.34s]  242
[660.34s -> 665.06s]  I can't well, here's the thing. This game is also like five times as long as all the souls games
[665.22s -> 674.55s]  So I that makes sense
[674.55s -> 677.59s]  Okay. All right. Let's go. Let's go up that way. There's nothing over there. I guess I can drop
[677.59s -> 679.59s]  I don't know why you would want to drop down there
[683.11s -> 686.97s]  That's a that's a big run
[686.97s -> 688.97s]  So I did look up
[689.13s -> 691.69s]  Yeah. Yeah, he's using a guide. No, this is beautiful though
[692.71s -> 693.99s]  I love that
[693.99s -> 699.67s]  You guys have just put on youtube videos of like that weird gooey lava just like falling down and somebody like hitting it with a stick
[701.90s -> 706.44s]  I want to do that
[706.52s -> 711.88s]  Like I wonder like where you do that like I want those videos of the people like oh and here's you take a look
[711.88s -> 715.96s]  And it's like really slow moving gooey like almost like cookie batter
[716.94s -> 720.62s]  and they like knock it with a stick and it's like goopy and it like breaks up and
[722.23s -> 725.19s]  I would do that for like three or four hours and that would be a vacation like that
[725.51s -> 727.51s]  That's what I wanted to do on vacation
[732.09s -> 736.68s]  I wouldn't care about anything else
[737.08s -> 742.84s]  You'd fall in i'm not gonna I wouldn't fall in the lava. It moves at like 0.2 miles per hour
[743.72s -> 746.09s]  I'm not gonna fall in the lava
[746.65s -> 751.37s]  Why would that happen?
[751.37s -> 756.09s]  Yes, you would no, I would not fall in the lava. Why do you guys think okay?
[758.87s -> 763.27s]  Why do you guys think that I like need to ride a bicycle with training wheels on it still?
[763.91s -> 767.21s]  You know, but like no, I see how so I was riding my bike yesterday
[767.85s -> 771.53s]  Oh, yeah, he has to have training wheels on he's he's he's brainless
[772.33s -> 776.41s]  No, I could ride a bike normally. I i'm not gonna fall into lava
[776.65s -> 781.85s]  I'm not what am I just gonna sit there and stare at it and just like lean forward until I face first like put
[781.85s -> 783.45s]  My face in the cake
[783.45s -> 785.45s]  That's what are you talking about?
[785.53s -> 792.78s]  Yeah, i'm gonna ride on my training wheels tricycle just into the lava and fall forward
[793.34s -> 803.10s]  This is so cool
[803.10s -> 809.91s]  I would go on vacation here
[809.91s -> 816.74s]  That would be the ultimate fall joke. I would wouldn't that would be awful
[821.08s -> 822.68s]  Do they make like
[822.68s -> 825.16s]  They gotta make like candy that's like this, right?
[826.87s -> 832.15s]  Is it like a and I don't want the lava candy that's like cinnamon red cinnamon apple bullshit
[832.23s -> 839.03s]  Okay, let me be very clear about that. They make like lava candy and it's red cinnamon bullshit
[842.62s -> 846.06s]  Why does everything no, I don't all right. This looks I don't like this
[846.78s -> 852.66s]  This looks like a boss place
[852.98s -> 856.71s]  Cinnamon's good
[856.71s -> 861.19s]  I you know, I have not jumped onto the cinnamon train. I'm sorry
[862.15s -> 866.31s]  I really kind of don't like it. It just overpowers everything that it touches
[867.03s -> 869.83s]  Oh, you want a latte? Yeah, sure. I'll take it. No, no, no, please
[869.83s -> 873.11s]  Can I just only taste cinnamon put like sprinkle one little ounce of oh my god
[873.83s -> 879.77s]  If you get anything with cinnamon on it, it's just a cinnamon thing. It doesn't taste like the thing you have
[880.33s -> 882.57s]  All right. Stop fucking complaining. Stop talking to me
[883.61s -> 889.83s]  I don't want to fight this fucking thing because like it is a million health
[891.00s -> 892.52s]  Will it burn?
[892.52s -> 896.55s]  I gotta put on fire resist
[896.55s -> 902.74s]  What the fuck cinnamon bros no cinnamon is
[903.46s -> 906.41s]  It's oh, it's too much
[906.41s -> 911.69s]  I appreciate cinnamons, you know that what what it's doing. I don't what i'm why am I acting like cinnamon is
[912.49s -> 914.58s]  like alive
[914.58s -> 918.90s]  I appreciate what cinnamon's going for but i'm not really into it that much like what are you talking about?
[919.70s -> 922.26s]  I get out of my way. I'm going to the building
[922.82s -> 931.51s]  Okay, you go through walls fix your fucking broken game
[932.15s -> 938.06s]  It's been a problem for a decade fix it people can shoot hit through walls fix your broken game
[938.78s -> 948.17s]  Okay, so this was where is this?
[948.17s -> 953.90s]  What was that?
[953.90s -> 959.37s]  It was it was you what the fuck I was terrified
[960.01s -> 964.68s]  Because the capcom rant no
[965.24s -> 966.68s]  All right. So this is

[968.70s -> 982.22s]  Isn't there because that's a shortcut to isn't there a bonfire like right here?

[1002.65s -> 1004.81s]  Anytime I have cinnamon, I always have the same like
[1006.55s -> 1009.19s]  Reaction to it. All right, so this is where that was
[1010.57s -> 1012.06s]  so
[1012.06s -> 1013.62s]  Okay
[1013.62s -> 1017.78s]  We go from here. I just want to get this burn in my brain. All right, so from this bonfire we go up

[1044.39s -> 1054.55s]  Okay
[1062.01s -> 1065.37s]  That's where it is i've been hearing this for the last like three in-game hours
[1066.25s -> 1073.82s]  What is it? Oh somber spinning stone. I can probably make that just run across right?
[1084.36s -> 1088.04s]  I have you what?
[1088.04s -> 1090.04s]  flabbergasted you're using cinnamon as a bit
[1094.26s -> 1095.38s]  don't
[1095.38s -> 1101.38s]  I don't like cinnamon. So that is this is like a like a comedy routine
[1104.47s -> 1106.62s]  Okay, wait a minute
[1106.62s -> 1109.02s]  If I had a microphone in my hand and there was a slight echo
[1109.18s -> 1111.74s]  I guess you I guess that play that whole okay
[1112.38s -> 1118.06s]  Play that whole thing back the entire thing that I said about like cinnamons and like red apple and stuff
[1118.94s -> 1124.06s]  Add a little bit of an echo and like a little bit of a mic effect and an audience laughing every like
[1124.62s -> 1126.84s]  10 to 15 seconds
[1126.84s -> 1130.20s]  If it probably would be like a comedy routine
[1136.18s -> 1137.46s]  Oh god
[1137.46s -> 1142.20s]  Still don't understand why the cinnamon challenge was
[1142.20s -> 1144.76s]  Even
[1149.05s -> 1152.09s]  Yeah, I forgot about that people would just like take a bunch of cinnamon and go like
[1152.81s -> 1156.65s]  Yeah, like spit it out. I forgot about that
[1157.29s -> 1159.29s]  That was a thing for a long time
[1160.09s -> 1168.33s]  I don't want this guy's gonna kill me
[1168.33s -> 1170.33s]  I'm sorry that I mentioned the candles

[1243.96s -> 1245.43s]  somber
[1245.43s -> 1246.39s]  You know
[1246.39s -> 1253.21s]  Just wait, can I keep going?
[1253.21s -> 1255.21s]  You're inside of a volcano right now
[1256.86s -> 1258.86s]  All right. If i'm from software i'm putting
[1259.02s -> 1277.34s]  How come you don't take fire damage? Where did this guy even come from?
[1279.86s -> 1281.86s]  Cinnamon is great 78 percent
[1286.87s -> 1289.83s]  Am I really that people really that in the uh,
[1292.87s -> 1294.87s]  You guys like cinnamon that much?
[1298.22s -> 1302.95s]  All right, let me go this way I could walk around the other way, which I think I might
[1304.82s -> 1316.22s]  Yes. Yes cinnamon slaps
[1316.22s -> 1318.22s]  Okay, I want you to do me a favor
[1324.71s -> 1325.67s]  uh
[1325.67s -> 1327.67s]  Name me something that cinnamon
[1328.15s -> 1330.07s]  Is good on
[1330.07s -> 1331.83s]  That's not a pie
[1331.83s -> 1334.15s]  Or uh, like a some kind of like dessert
[1335.03s -> 1339.59s]  Like what else where where else can you use cinnamon besides like a fucking like the crust of a pie?
[1340.86s -> 1347.18s]  Cinnamon toast crunch does not count. That's like cinnamon sugar bullshit. That's not real cinnamon
[1347.90s -> 1354.66s]  Yeah, yeah, that's that is like not even close to being real cinnamon
[1355.83s -> 1357.67s]  It's like sugar
[1357.67s -> 1362.52s]  Somebody in a flavor lab came up with that. That's not cinnamon
[1365.27s -> 1372.65s]  apple sauce
[1372.65s -> 1376.94s]  Apple sauce drunk you drunk
[1383.59s -> 1386.92s]  on eggnog
[1386.92s -> 1388.92s]  All right. Look, I gotta pay attention to the fucking game
[1389.88s -> 1391.94s]  This is where I want to be
[1391.94s -> 1392.98s]  Yes, okay
[1392.98s -> 1398.26s]  I spent like two hours yesterday just talking and like walking in circles. I gotta like progress through
[1398.88s -> 1401.89s]  elderberry ring
[1402.23s -> 1421.24s]  Probably should sit at the bonfire though. I love cinnamon apple sauce
[1422.12s -> 1431.08s]  I mean, I guess it's like, okay
[1433.78s -> 1436.82s]  So I would put it pretty low on like the
[1437.78s -> 1439.78s]  kind of spices list
[1446.28s -> 1449.19s]  All right, that one has it right
[1449.19s -> 1453.22s]  Why would I jump to it? What a spices tier list
[1453.86s -> 1457.21s]  I don't think one exists
[1457.21s -> 1463.67s]  All right. Let me check down here first
[1463.67s -> 1465.05s]  what about
[1465.05s -> 1468.33s]  Apple jacks or apple jacks is it's all this like cinnamon
[1469.58s -> 1473.10s]  It's cinnamon sugar fake cinnamon shit. It's not actual cinnamon
[1477.51s -> 1478.07s]  You know what they do?
[1478.07s -> 1483.91s]  They put like one they put like one little dash of cinnamon and then like five tablespoons of sugar and they mix it up
[1489.93s -> 1491.45s]  I think i've been over here already
[1491.45s -> 1493.82s]  Let me go back up. Yeah, I was
[1494.14s -> 1500.95s]  You're moving goal posts that's what that's what I do here
[1507.50s -> 1509.66s]  Opium cinnamon sugar isn't actually cinnamon
[1514.10s -> 1515.70s]  Is whipped cream milk?
[1515.70s -> 1520.14s]  Does that argument make any sense? Somebody will I don't know maybe
[1524.12s -> 1529.40s]  No, it's not it's not milk. It's it has milk in it. It's made from milk, but it's not just milk
[1529.94s -> 1531.94s]  Cinnamon just cinnamon is gross
[1532.97s -> 1534.17s]  I win
[1534.17s -> 1541.98s]  It's one place that I would agree with you
[1542.62s -> 1544.54s]  and that is
[1544.54s -> 1546.54s]  taco bell cinnamon twisties
[1547.90s -> 1549.90s]  That is the one spot. I will agree with you
[1551.75s -> 1553.61s]  but again
[1553.61s -> 1557.45s]  Not really cinnamon is it it's like one percent cinnamon
[1561.21s -> 1564.84s]  I've been down here, right?
[1564.84s -> 1566.04s]  Where does that?
[1566.04s -> 1570.98s]  Oh, okay. Okay. So this is that this ladder goes. Wait a minute
[1572.07s -> 1574.68s]  I've not been here yet. Have I?
[1574.68s -> 1576.68s]  No, I haven't. All right. Hold on. Where's the elevator go?
[1581.24s -> 1587.16s]  Add I did there's no ad for taco bell that taco bell is like the best fast food place
[1588.92s -> 1590.38s]  best
[1590.38s -> 1593.10s]  It goes it does go over mcdonald's for me
[1595.19s -> 1597.11s]  It is better than mcdonald's
[1597.11s -> 1599.86s]  Because it has the single best menu item
[1600.90s -> 1606.18s]  Any restaurant in the world and i'm not talking fast, but I mean restaurant like you go to fight the best single
[1606.80s -> 1619.11s]  Restaurant item on earth. I would eat a cheesy godita crunch over filet mignon and be like, yeah, that was better
[1620.10s -> 1622.10s]  Just a single best menu item in the world
[1633.16s -> 1635.16s]  Kind of spitting facts
[1638.54s -> 1641.34s]  Well, thank you. I appreciate it. Is this an illusionary wall?
[1643.56s -> 1645.56s]  Dude kind of spitting facts right now
[1647.78s -> 1650.74s]  Where's he going? I just got an elevator. I'm trying to see where it is
[1652.52s -> 1655.24s]  Wait, I already went in that elevator. I'm very distracted
[1655.80s -> 1657.48s]  Okay, I am
[1657.48s -> 1659.56s]  All right. I'm extraordinarily distracted
[1667.03s -> 1671.43s]  Zero progress. It's been 30 fucking minutes. I know but I just like whatever
[1672.07s -> 1677.45s]  I told you i'm an elden ring streamer now and that means this is like I got to drag the content out
[1681.91s -> 1685.93s]  Fuck all right. I'm doing progress now. No more talking about anything that doesn't all right. Hold on
[1688.49s -> 1690.89s]  I want I want to save all these crunchies, but i'll use them
[1693.89s -> 1698.92s]  1000 there we go. I stubble I need to shave tonight probably
[1700.81s -> 1702.81s]  All right. I have 20 endurance
[1703.45s -> 1705.45s]  I am at everywhere. I want to be
[1706.01s -> 1708.73s]  Another question is do I keep leveling up vigor?
[1710.18s -> 1713.14s]  Or do I put some more points in mind get mine to like 25?
[1713.70s -> 1722.90s]  I'm gonna say mine mine and then maybe go back to an int
[1723.54s -> 1730.84s]  I'll get mine to 25. I feel like I do really need mana. All right, here we go time for progress
[1731.48s -> 1736.66s]  You should pretend you're let's playing, you know how many times i've made that joke
[1738.39s -> 1741.03s]  I've done the like i'm making a let's play
[1743.34s -> 1748.60s]  After the age of twitch, right? I don't you guys remember but people would do let's plays
[1749.64s -> 1751.62s]  They probably still do
[1751.62s -> 1755.30s]  Where it would the video would be 10 to 15 minutes long and then there'd be like another video
[1757.54s -> 1761.38s]  Good luck making one of those kinds of youtube playlists with this game
[1762.18s -> 1764.94s]  You're gonna have like 800 videos
[1765.50s -> 1772.23s]  This is gonna be something crazy get to the uh, the vigor soft cap. It's 50
[1773.19s -> 1775.35s]  Yeah, after after mine 25 i'll get there
[1776.82s -> 1778.82s]  All right. So here we go. Let's go. Here we go. This is the way i'm going
[1780.71s -> 1783.02s]  Game progress i'm ready
[1783.02s -> 1786.80s]  Going this way. We're gonna progress not going down any weird ladders
[1789.74s -> 1794.90s]  Oh, but I was gonna I looked up, uh, I didn't look up any explorers or anything
[1794.90s -> 1798.42s]  but I wanted to see the level kind of range for uh mount delmer
[1799.38s -> 1804.02s]  And it's the thing that I just looked up level range mount gelmer
[1805.06s -> 1807.56s]  And it says 80 to 100
[1807.56s -> 1808.92s]  so
[1808.92s -> 1814.28s]  I think i'm all right. I'm right at the kind of top end of uh of being like leveled for this area. So
[1815.00s -> 1817.50s]  What is this place called? It's not gelmer
[1818.50s -> 1821.61s]  Gilmer what's this place called?
[1822.25s -> 1828.33s]  What is this place called?
[1828.33s -> 1831.51s]  mount gilmore
[1831.51s -> 1836.15s]  Helman mount gilmore. It's gelmer. That's what I said. I said gelmer
[1838.84s -> 1841.56s]  What are you talking about? That's exactly what I just said gelmer
[1842.20s -> 1846.10s]  What is it? Is it like is it like gel near?
[1846.66s -> 1852.87s]  How many times do you swing this around the circle, dude?
[1853.59s -> 1855.43s]  All right, fine. Fuck it
[1855.43s -> 1857.35s]  crystal barrage
[1857.35s -> 1868.89s]  That move is seriously so bad. I don't know why I have it in my loadout
[1875.16s -> 1879.13s]  Gelmer
[1879.13s -> 1884.87s]  It's not gelmer
[1884.87s -> 1886.87s]  Oh come to gelmer
[1887.27s -> 1889.27s]  mount mount gelman
[1892.58s -> 1894.42s]  commoners, hey

[2038.65s -> 2040.65s]  kind of medical problems
[2040.89s -> 2045.13s]  I haven't really been playing that much. I didn't want to play off stream content that I haven't seen yet
[2046.17s -> 2047.13s]  so
[2047.13s -> 2051.29s]  Now that i'm like, i'm like I can stream i'm like good to go for a little bit. I think
[2052.09s -> 2056.57s]  As I want to play like I want to play elden ring and I don't want to play off stream unless i've already seen it
[2057.86s -> 2059.86s]  All right. Well, this is one of those things back here
[2066.39s -> 2069.75s]  I feel like i've not been paying attention to the amount of these keys that I still have
[2072.12s -> 2073.64s]  I've just been using them
[2073.64s -> 2085.50s]  Okay, I got a lot of 11 heads up. You're almost at the cutoff for the assassination missions. Thank you backseater
[2086.22s -> 2111.40s]  I actually appreciate it. How far down does this go?

[2179.35s -> 2189.34s]  Double that right there. I don't think you can no you can't jump on that. Maybe there's an elevator that goes up
[2198.66s -> 2209.67s]  I love this. Is this safe to fall down? Oh fuck. I probably messed that up
[2210.79s -> 2220.01s]  I don't know. Who's the who's your your favorite life?
[2233.66s -> 2242.02s]  All right, so this is down here it's the wrong game is it though

[2281.67s -> 2288.94s]  waifu again
[2288.94s -> 2291.10s]  Why do I have to play by a certain set of rules though?
[2291.18s -> 2293.82s]  Right, like you a bunch of you guys say that shit a lot
[2294.14s -> 2296.46s]  But I can't make a reference to it, right?
[2296.62s -> 2299.58s]  Like why do you get to play by a different set of rules that I do?
[2300.14s -> 2306.49s]  I feel like that painting's gonna be as alive royal knights resolve
[2307.13s -> 2311.80s]  Because you're a grown adult
[2315.38s -> 2319.14s]  Yeah, but I you I you guys make references to this shit like what I
[2324.15s -> 2328.71s]  And to be very fair, my my response was a very joke response. Okay
[2329.35s -> 2334.15s]  Because you're 36
[2345.80s -> 2346.68s]  Oh

[2382.02s -> 2385.32s]  Are you surprised that I belong to the volcano manor?
[2385.88s -> 2390.52s]  I always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable two fingers
[2391.08s -> 2395.38s]  I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade not to mention
[2395.94s -> 2398.26s]  Tanith has always made me curious
[2398.90s -> 2401.06s]  I think her master must really be something
[2401.78s -> 2403.78s]  She's pretty damn smug about it
[2404.42s -> 2409.06s]  Even after announcing her blasphemous ambitions. She still stands proud
[2409.70s -> 2415.64s]  I've never seen a woman quite like her. I just you have a regular
[2416.12s -> 2418.12s]  Plus two short spear
[2419.75s -> 2423.27s]  I don't think you get to tell me how what what i'm doing here. Okay

[3317.03s -> 3325.88s]  here is your usual reward am now perhaps the time has come to tell you
[3326.52s -> 3333.59s]  of the true ruler of this manor lord oh i'm here to kill him the erd tree blessed the tarnished
[3333.59s -> 3340.63s]  with grace but it was all too meager in the face of the enormity of their task the tarnished were
[3340.63s -> 3347.91s]  forced to scavenge squabbling for crumbs like the shard bearers vying for power in the wake of the
[3347.91s -> 3357.59s]  shattering our lord indignant has refused to scurry about fighting over what miserly scraps
[3357.59s -> 3365.19s]  they allow us if the earth tree and indeed the very gods would debase us so then we are willing
[3365.19s -> 3374.34s]  to raise the banner of resistance even if it means heresy we at the volcano manor under lord have
[3374.34s -> 3382.34s]  sworn no rest until i kill him if you follow this heroic path one day the lord will see
[3382.34s -> 3388.42s]  are you gonna be able just to backstab him visits with our champions are always a spectacle it
[3388.42s -> 3402.26s]  cannot come a day too soon what's up dude yeah that arm is pretty fucking cool that's pretty

[4257.85s -> 4262.57s]  i've you've been here for the beginning of the game look i don't want you to perhaps i am a fool
[4262.57s -> 4269.42s]  no it's worse than that let's think what an easy mark i was i don't like that i all the
[4269.42s -> 4280.39s]  npcs that i like are starting to like kind of go away ah you'd soon return what is it 5050

[4302.54s -> 4316.39s]  it is it's faith and sorcery not happening cool though so faith and sorcery i always thought you
[4316.39s -> 4320.79s]  had to pick one but i guess when you get later in the game you can kind of combine them that's
[4320.79s -> 4343.37s]  kind of cool you still a lot all right so let's talk to patches who's that what is this brave
[4343.37s -> 4350.54s]  tarnished what is your business here i'm afraid this is not a guest room what's that peculiar

[4397.98s -> 4407.21s]  born by the grace the lady tannis is a serpent that cherishes this form i inhabit what i am
[4407.21s -> 4415.35s]  okay all right people are cruel if they saw my true form they wouldn't speak to me perhaps so
[4415.43s -> 4432.09s]  i assume a guise when seeking new recruits but you are not like the rest don't worry
[4432.09s -> 4448.55s]  my serpentine form zorias the secrets known only to lady tannis and i now i share the secrets with
[4448.55s -> 4457.29s]  you as well please keep them safe from anyone else i would uh advise you we close the door
[4459.19s -> 4461.27s]  you want to keep a secret that you're a serpent
[4466.31s -> 4476.20s]  um like that's not a great way to hide all it takes is for you know like like
[4476.20s -> 4480.36s]  i don't even know his name dalios just needs to come out and get like a coffee
[4480.36s -> 4484.28s]  from like the fucking lobby and he's gonna see you all right so should i talk to the mom
[4484.92s -> 4494.14s]  i gotta talk to patches but if you follow this it cannot oh shit do you see her
[4494.78s -> 4506.47s]  the girl with her true face if she confided in you the name zorias then perhaps it is not my place
[4506.47s -> 4517.82s]  to speak but as her adoptive mother ask of you please be kind to her look after young zorias
[4518.38s -> 4526.09s]  all right true visage belies the purity of her heart honestly i hardly deserve the sweet child
[4526.09s -> 4540.10s]  she's a snake whatever she's snake lady whatever anything else to say please be kind
[4548.41s -> 4555.24s]  there's like this like all kinds of this like turtles that talk it's like the little apes

[4715.78s -> 4730.38s]  in your heart next time hey wait that thing is probably crazy it's dex faith magma whip
[4734.04s -> 4756.20s]  but is it a whip it's a whip that's so awesome i need to like to swing it really it's a sticky
[4756.20s -> 4768.42s]  hand from those like 25 cent machines that's definitely way cooler if i had the specs to use
[4768.42s -> 4775.94s]  it i mean that's awesome that's probably the coolest faith weapon i've seen in the game so
[4775.94s -> 4794.49s]  far all right well that was fun thanks patches so is that it where's there more if you follow the
[4794.49s -> 4802.06s]  hip camera somebody said i what do i lose access to doing these because i don't think i'm comfortable

[4827.94s -> 4834.94s]  my mind never ceases to turn of late no i can trust you i saw something
[4837.18s -> 4844.46s]  in the pitch black of night it entered the room next to this one and never came out
[4845.10s -> 4853.58s]  if i'm not mistaken it took the form of a serpent just like me does the volcano
[4853.58s -> 4861.10s]  manor hides in secret that lady tannis has kept who's the snake i realize that i shouldn't impose
[4861.10s -> 4869.46s]  but if you discover anything who's the snake would you please share other of the oh i already saw it
[4872.31s -> 4884.84s]  was a secret after all lady tannis has deceived me was i not the grace of a king oh you're good

[5128.60s -> 5134.44s]  no scouting duties now has she gone off in search of answers why won't she just listen
[5140.06s -> 5151.58s]  yeah may i ask you not as the man as proprietress but as his mother if she discovers the answer to
[5151.58s -> 5158.94s]  her question and it causes distress or have a drink this potion to purge that which would
[5158.94s -> 5165.26s]  cause her pain i don't want to give her a fucking potion tonic of forgetfulness yes my wish is a
[5165.26s -> 5171.42s]  grave disrespect to her no different than the earth tree's imposition but i have no choice
[5172.70s -> 5179.46s]  it must be done my wish is a great i've noticed okay so hold on a minute you're telling me that
[5179.46s -> 5186.22s]  i'm supposed to give her this drink that is going to make her like do what forgetfulness
[5186.22s -> 5198.50s]  let me see what that says where is it tonic in a small brass bowl vanish vanishes distress
[5198.50s -> 5205.38s]  and bitter memories a gift bestowed by ryckhard sworn to blasphemy to lady tenneth who unfortunately
[5205.38s -> 5213.03s]  had no use for it my lord there could be no greater distress than to forget you small
[5213.03s -> 5218.71s]  flask received from perceptor selvis containing a cloudy tonic of bluish black find nepheli and
[5218.71s -> 5226.95s]  ensure she drinks it all right make sure i don't like fucking mix these up i also have like a bunch
[5226.95s -> 5233.77s]  of perfume like potion bottles i i need like a little bit of a management system here just chug
[5233.77s -> 5246.76s]  both there's only one of these what okay so i need to find where she went which is not very much info
[5247.48s -> 5254.84s]  i'm imagining it's probably somewhere here all right it's got to be somewhere in the manner
[5254.84s -> 5260.92s]  right if you follow the hip cannot there's no info on where she would be is there like a clue left
[5260.92s -> 5268.04s]  in the room or something you want directions do you want to find it yourself um i'm gonna imagine
[5268.60s -> 5276.04s]  it's probably in the walls either that or it's further in the zone that i haven't been yet
[5277.59s -> 5285.83s]  i'm gonna okay tell me if i'm on the right spot am i on the right path going in like she's in the
[5286.23s -> 5300.01s]  in here somewhere in the secret wall no very cold okay somewhere in the dungeon overall okay
[5300.01s -> 5312.22s]  all right uh we'll beep as you get closer he's in the lava area you guys can start beeping
[5313.98s -> 5321.69s]  all right now my question to you all is this it was the concern that i know do you got to do this
[5321.69s -> 5329.56s]  first because you might lose access to it after doing the boss here am i safe to do the boss now
[5330.28s -> 5345.11s]  is that okay am i safe to continue to progress i'm gonna go i have to finish the assassin missions

[5359.58s -> 5365.90s]  come back to the boss later just do the boss it's fine especially for no kidding the boss after the
[5365.90s -> 5372.25s]  snake girl you don't need the assassination missions okay so i'll let me try to find her

[6526.89s -> 6541.90s]  yet that's like across the whole world that's like the next zone you have to or it's gonna go away

[6575.61s -> 6594.28s]  because i want to level up one more time i had it was it 60 000 60 something 67 000 that's way more
[6594.28s -> 6606.01s]  than i thought it was going to be sorry and i remember the bonfire that it was to go because
[6606.01s -> 6613.13s]  there was like a big open door probably gonna be the boss remember you promised that you were
[6613.13s -> 6620.41s]  gonna throw auto on stream sorry me strong will take care of it yeah all of my duties all the
[6620.41s -> 6635.88s]  things i say are just gonna go on to me strong i have to start killing these things why are you
[6635.88s -> 6641.40s]  procrastinating an elden ring i feel like that's a huge part of the game is to kind of wander around
[6641.40s -> 6653.03s]  and come back and do stuff way later all right i need i need to kill a few things where can i go
[6653.03s -> 6662.89s]  to just kill a bunch of random shit i'm gonna go to where that boss is um where i was right from the
[6662.89s -> 6667.37s]  church from the church right what's the bonfire to get to where i was looking i was like oh look
[6667.37s -> 6680.44s]  at that big open door i think it's here the more you rush the more the less elden ring content
[6680.44s -> 6690.17s]  we're gonna get oh that's literally where i was just fucking standing jeremy i was just standing
[6690.17s -> 6712.28s]  there i was standing there i need the fucking goddamn vitamins today all right this is this
[6712.28s -> 6720.02s]  is this is correct yes it is all right so now i want to go over here and i want to go not that
[6720.02s -> 6726.36s]  way i want to go the other way there's a place that i wanted to go and i don't remember where the
[6726.84s -> 6731.56s]  where the fuck it is it's up up there i don't know dude i have no idea
[6733.40s -> 6747.16s]  did you find the illusory toilet is that where you you sit down to take a shit and when you shit
[6747.72s -> 6751.72s]  you actually like squeeze out your shit the toilet goes away and you shit on the floor
[6752.36s -> 6762.95s]  what would that mean it's all right i i need to really fucking figure out where i'm going here
[6764.01s -> 6769.61s]  this area is just my brain is having so much trouble with this zone because it's like the
[6775.46s -> 6783.14s]  yes somebody did say that yes they did i read that i read it somebody said it all right give
[6783.14s -> 6786.50s]  me a hand here because like i've honestly like we've been talking about like illusory toilets i
[6786.50s -> 6790.84s]  don't i what's what about where am i going i remember i looked at it and i was like i need
[6790.84s -> 6797.75s]  to go that way and i just kind of i forgot where i was going where was it it was like up there i
[6797.75s -> 6812.25s]  think was the temple because i had to be like up higher i didn't know how so much verticality in
[6812.25s -> 6817.37s]  this game my brain it's like the map doesn't show like verticality so it's just like is that one
[6817.37s -> 6828.04s]  higher are we up are we down and then it's from here out yeah and then it's to the left of here
[6828.04s -> 6836.86s]  right no it's up and then off the balcony so much fucking verticality this is like this is like
[6836.86s -> 6845.58s]  two thousand feet up and down like from from each of these four bonfires it's like it's like four
[6845.58s -> 6856.84s]  thousand feet up and down below and up above sea level because then there's this way which leads
[6856.84s -> 6865.78s]  to up here and then did i want to go i want to go up from here right because then the manor is
[6865.78s -> 6874.65s]  behind me i think this is correct but this place is fucking 10 000 feet below and above sea level
[6875.69s -> 6891.35s]  like it's huge it's a goddamn mountain okay it's a mountain and then oh fucking god damn it i have
[6891.35s -> 6902.79s]  no idea where i'm going take to go at the shortcut elevator what's he trying to do i actually
[6902.79s -> 6908.95s]  don't i don't know like i i'm trying to go to like with that area where i could i've looked over and
[6908.95s -> 6916.62s]  i'm just gonna go watch the vod and go see where the fuck i was i just i can't put it into long
[6916.62s -> 6921.85s]  term memory there's so many there's so many like levels to this mountain you were going the right
[6921.85s -> 6940.23s]  way can i really not go to the map because these fucking slugs are in front of me if all the slugs
[6940.31s -> 6946.33s]  have all right let me let me let me play out a scenario this is fucking confusing all right so
[6946.33s -> 6953.45s]  let me play a scenario out go to the elevator that is next to the not the elevator where the
[6953.45s -> 6966.95s]  boss was that second elevator and then go from there right i think that's right you had too
[6966.95s -> 6980.65s]  many flintstone gummies okay yeah so it's like out here and then in this elevator and then out that
[6980.65s -> 6997.03s]  way and go all the way up i'm painting it in my head right now okay then we go this way nice try
[7000.25s -> 7028.15s]  and then out here i think yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then over here and then okay
[7028.15s -> 7038.98s]  all right but this is where i want it this is yeah yeah yeah yeah yep and up yeah it's so hard to
[7038.98s -> 7052.42s]  find this stuff i said they came in that they came back like an hour and a half later and i
[7052.42s -> 7058.02s]  was still in this room i just i did a bunch of like side quests shit okay i did a bunch of side
[7058.02s -> 7066.18s]  missions i i did like the whole serpent girl quest line i did the assassination mission i've been
[7066.18s -> 7082.04s]  doing things i've been keeping myself busy yeah because then i went down here and i remember
[7082.04s -> 7087.93s]  specifically being like how the fuck do i get back here me strong gonna handle that one i me
[7087.93s -> 7094.90s]  strong's gonna handle that one yep it was so long ago that i didn't put this into long-term
[7094.90s -> 7104.54s]  memory it's so funny that i keep saying me strong is gonna handle this but i don't think me strong
[7104.54s -> 7113.77s]  is gonna be able to like get out of limb grave me strong is gonna walk off a cliff and limb grave
[7113.77s -> 7131.93s]  like 50 times and i'm gonna have to turn the stream off i get your step will the will the me
[7131.93s -> 7138.57s]  strong jokes last as long as the 50 hours it's gonna take for this character um i am not gonna
[7138.57s -> 7146.71s]  play through the entire game as that character so don't worry that will be maybe one afternoon
[7146.71s -> 7156.58s]  stream where i'd be lucky to be able to even beat the tree sentinel all right so this is
[7157.14s -> 7178.06s]  i get where is this gonna take me find out i have no idea whatever i'm not ready this is it i'm not
[7178.06s -> 7183.98s]  ready for this i have 48 000 souls i need to hold on i'm not ready for this this is the audience

[7682.82s -> 7700.23s]  this a gimmick fight where is it serpent hunter weapon that serves as both great sword and spear
[7701.45s -> 7707.37s]  thought to have been used to hunt an immortal great serpent in the distant past it manifests
[7707.37s -> 7714.41s]  a long blade of light when facing such a creature okay when their master's heroic aspirations
[7714.41s -> 7719.29s]  degenerate into mere greed his men search for weapon with which they might halt their lord
[7720.17s -> 7725.13s]  great serpent hunt perform a powerful forward lunge and follow up with an upward thrust via
[7725.13s -> 7730.65s]  additional input when fighting a great serpent a long blade of light will appear revealing the
[7730.65s -> 7739.19s]  armament's true power so should i take off should i try to get to medium load or i don't
[7739.91s -> 7754.26s]  let me let me what does this do all right okay so let's i gotta get to medium load

[8224.44s -> 8228.70s]  that was really cool it was a gimmick fight but it was a fun gimmick fight although that's probably
[8228.70s -> 8232.54s]  phase one and phase two he's gonna come out of the head and he's gonna be like tarnish tarnish
[8232.54s -> 8236.30s]  tarnish tarnish and then it's like uh here comes the real fight and it's gonna be horrible
[8237.10s -> 8294.68s]  oh very well why does this cut to that it's gonna be fucking hell do i still have to use the gimmick
[8323.16s -> 8337.35s]  oh my fucking god dude that was a lot bro you hit the ground first the fire follows you
[8337.99s -> 8382.58s]  what the hell's happening what oh can we stop with that move can we stop oh my god

[8449.88s -> 8458.76s]  dude i i don't i you have to run from this you gotta you gotta run run run run run run
[8459.64s -> 8475.14s]  i won't even go near him just literally run in a circle this is over oh wait a minute wait a
[8475.14s -> 8480.44s]  minute wait a minute okay all right all right i get it i get okay all right wait a minute
[8483.83s -> 8487.45s]  all right all right wait a minute okay all right wait a minute

[8732.31s -> 8814.41s]  all right let's uh let's kill this guy i like a plan he's not that bad it's just trying to
[8814.97s -> 8824.01s]  trying to run away from the skull move seems very very hard i there's probably a way to
[8824.01s -> 8838.44s]  to get away from it i wonder what's the best way to get away from that just run i wonder if i just
[8838.44s -> 8853.72s]  do a full sprint you need to try to stun lock his entire second phase well let's just hope i can
[8853.72s -> 8889.82s]  get to the second phase again oh you're gonna jump over that shit i don't know i'm too greedy
[8890.54s -> 8944.34s]  not locked on that's bad news oh i don't want that on me for this shit zombie fuck i'm poisoned
[8944.34s -> 9020.65s]  fuck fuck go get him boys what is that he's already doing this fucking move he's already doing it
[9021.21s -> 9084.89s]  he hits the ground shit all right now run whose item whose fucking costume is this
[9095.75s -> 9135.88s]  hey fuck off oh shit oh sorry should i jump are you supposed to get away from that a jump
[9135.88s -> 9146.07s]  i don't i don't understand that move when he comes you can't dodge it you have to jump over it well
[9146.07s -> 9154.15s]  can you just you can you just can i just out run it if i just run this motherfucker i swear to god
[9154.79s -> 9161.24s]  i feel like i've dodged it pretty well the last few times it just still hits you with it
[9162.81s -> 9168.66s]  dodged later it's fucking slow ass motherfucker i swear to god
[9169.86s -> 9184.36s]  greedy that's very very that was very greedy um let me try to outrun it if i just sprint i wonder
[9184.36s -> 9248.81s]  if it works come on do something really what get away from the fucking poison please
[9249.93s -> 9277.98s]  i'm gonna try to outrun that move i'm just gonna run if he still hits me then it's your fault
[9277.98s -> 9357.18s]  because you told me to do it oh come on do it again again again again again oh
[9382.17s -> 9430.84s]  where the fuck am i oh shit he changes fucking combo up chug chug chug chug chug chug damn
[9435.83s -> 9447.59s]  that was crazy so honestly the he's not dead all right the strategy there honestly was just to
[9447.59s -> 9465.37s]  just to eat the flame skulls and just try to dodge them don't run am all right cool also
[9465.37s -> 9475.59s]  you just got to go aggressive uh the chatter was right i've just taken too much time to try to just
[9475.59s -> 9479.91s]  wait for him to do something just get in there and just have mana potions and l2 l2 and just
[9479.91s -> 9486.17s]  unlock the fuck out of them just keep hitting them over and over again that was cool fight
[9486.97s -> 9504.79s]  it was very cool 130 000 that's a lot yeah all right so uh let me rest here i said i want a 25
[9504.79s -> 9523.06s]  mind right i wonder what you get for this for this remembrance reload the boss area
[9523.86s -> 9538.66s]  he's level 106 reload this area go back to volcano matter and income all right well
[9538.66s -> 9558.10s]  hold on let me let's do this first i want to see what's in here this boss weapon is amazing i
[9558.10s -> 9572.58s]  wonder what it is is it intelligence blasphemous blade faith dex and strength another great faith
[9572.58s -> 9584.73s]  weapon some hp is restored upon defeating an enemy raise the sacred sword of loft is set
[9584.73s -> 9595.18s]  to blaze with blasphemous flames is steel hp that sounds insane and this is wow this is 40
[9595.18s -> 9609.56s]  int 18 releases searing spirits that repeatedly explode oh it's the skulls try to get this that's
[9609.56s -> 9617.14s]  i don't have any the faith though no i'm not it's not gonna be close 18 faith i'd have to put on
[9617.14s -> 9629.34s]  a rune which would get me to 11 and then some faith talisman which would be 16
[9630.30s -> 9641.78s]  and then a faith helmet which is would give me to 18 could respect too but is it really worth it
[9642.34s -> 9657.34s]  the spell is for the birds don't worry i wonder not for one spell not worth it the sword is cool
[9657.34s -> 9665.00s]  but i just it's not this character that looks like it'd be cool too but i think i'm just gonna
[9665.00s -> 9679.77s]  smash it if you do anything just get the sword instead be strong would like this yeah probably
[9682.07s -> 9704.02s]  yeah i'm gonna break it i'm gonna smash it it's it's too much faith to have to go respect for one
[9704.02s -> 9715.32s]  spell i don't think so although i do i've been neglecting sorcery really badly so like the last
[9715.32s -> 9725.46s]  few um last few streams i i think i'm gonna have to go get a couple of good spells these are comets
[9725.46s -> 9735.38s]  really good swift glenstone's all right for like range but i don't know actually i should
[9735.38s -> 9745.96s]  probably upgrade the uh staff as well go kill the dragon in the ranny area yeah that's a good idea
[9745.96s -> 9759.91s]  i'll go do that that's the best spell in the whole game okay i'll go get it but first
[9765.06s -> 9773.56s]  literally almost everything from the volcano east needs faith all right let me see if i let me
[9773.56s -> 9780.25s]  upgrade my uh staff i think i might be able to upgrade the boys as well well i took you for that
[9780.25s -> 9789.93s]  matter it's all about your own smithingstone eight these are very high okay how about you can
[9789.93s -> 9805.40s]  i upgrade anybody i can upgrade the boys boys plus nine what a waste of fucking materials
[9805.40s -> 9822.74s]  let's go who else do i want to try oleg is plus four but we got a lot of other we got other ones

[11023.56s -> 11032.07s]  volcano manner in the image of a queen increases dexterity oh long ago when ricard first set eyes
[11032.07s -> 11038.31s]  on tennis she was working as a dancer in a foreign land soon he made her his consort he was the only
[11038.31s -> 11045.98s]  human to remain by his side when he became the serpent of blasphemy it's only one dex too
[11046.78s -> 11064.41s]  what about the robes on sorts robes sucks ass why did he kill her she's literally eating this guy

[11120.71s -> 11128.94s]  throat pouch to spew fire all right next on the agenda volcano manner is pretty much complete
[11128.94s -> 11133.75s]  there's probably a few things i didn't do but you know me strong will take care of it eventually

[11425.24s -> 11433.34s]  break that was tiny that was not far nice cringe face whatever that was stupid
[11436.20s -> 11439.64s]  you'll be good this time that was doing fine
[11503.21s -> 11665.74s]  finally oh my god that crack what you man watch out for that shit get off finally
[11678.47s -> 11688.12s]  oh my god hide in the building hide in the building hide in the building
[11689.16s -> 11732.23s]  oh fuck i'm good what did i just hit him in the air what the fuck just happened
[11732.79s -> 11739.75s]  what i just launched him like a thousand feet in the air he was like get up boy what are you doing
[11751.88s -> 11762.12s]  jesus christ a doula's moon blade you guys didn't do shit you guys didn't do anything
[11762.12s -> 11771.05s]  you just you just sat there like this i'm very disappointed in you you are plus nine i fed you
[11771.05s -> 11776.73s]  four or five of you dickheads so much grave glove wart you're gonna be bloated later you're gonna
[11776.73s -> 11787.18s]  be bloated i can't believe you didn't they didn't do anything all right so what was that sweeping
[11787.18s -> 11794.82s]  slash old projectile ponders a cold magic great sword then delivers a sweeping blow that launches
[11794.82s -> 11811.24s]  a blade-like projectile of frost and be cast repeatedly 120 000 souls too jesus i didn't
[11811.24s -> 11820.82s]  even get those either oh my god holy shit i'm gonna level up like two three times all right
[11820.82s -> 11827.16s]  there was there was another dragon here wasn't there here i remember there was a dragon that
[11827.16s -> 11838.36s]  hung out here wasn't there or am i crazy but that was the same one oh okay he just moves around
[11838.84s -> 11856.50s]  all right well let me try that spell there's your 25 mind that's that's pretty good i still have a
[11856.50s -> 11862.10s]  lot of souls i don't know how much is it to level up oh okay okay i can do it again so now what do
[11862.10s -> 11871.00s]  i focus on do i just dump points in intelligence or should i get up to a 50 vigor probably vigor
[11871.00s -> 11885.37s]  i would imagine it's a 60 and you both i'll go back and forth between the two let's get into 60
[11886.33s -> 11897.58s]  okay so we have okay this spell is dog shit get rid of it i have this a doula's moon blade which
[11897.58s -> 11903.98s]  is going to be insane uh i use i use style light all the time swift is good comments good i don't
[11903.98s -> 11919.88s]  have anything better though okay did they buff some of this shit to not be awful which one of
[11919.88s -> 11926.09s]  these is actually worth using now crystal barrage is terrible but some of these actually worth
[11926.09s -> 11938.66s]  using they're not just terrible the arc is better now the comet i don't have that but like night
[11938.66s -> 11945.99s]  comet or something great bow is good now great glint stone shot was buffed that's just better
[11947.90s -> 11959.91s]  that's cost less too maybe i'll try that instead of the um in a comet there's an ice spell that's
[11959.91s -> 11969.94s]  like comet did they make okay question is meteor any good because this was terrible terrible really
[11969.94s -> 11984.58s]  truly terrible truly awful it's still useless how about night comet and i'll put it on there
[11984.58s -> 11992.28s]  all right let's see how cool this move is yeah okay can i charge it
[11996.62s -> 12009.51s]  holy shit that's an arc how far does it go and with member this is important
[12011.11s -> 12021.98s]  this staff is reduces casting time of sorceries so i that actually is really quickly happening here
[12022.54s -> 12038.01s]  awesome you can multi hit you get a better meteor later on like the guy at the bottom of the tower
[12038.01s -> 12048.49s]  okay say so one of the best aoe trash killing spells it feels like it it's a huge arc
[12049.29s -> 12095.27s]  i wonder how it does uh damage wise oh shit who's that who the fuck is this person can we talk
[12095.27s -> 12113.35s]  it's one of the assassins why would i be fighting him why would i fight blade i don't think i should
[12113.35s -> 12155.66s]  fight blade i like this guy he's lost he lost his mind what oh oh shit he is crazy holy shit
[12155.66s -> 12173.22s]  how much damage did i just try you see what i just did why would i just floating in the air
[12173.86s -> 12201.37s]  oh my god i got him what no i why does it have to be getting killed royal greatsword in all of his
[12201.37s -> 12219.96s]  armor i really liked that guy so he went mad okay so he went mad this is int greatsword decorated
[12219.96s -> 12226.71s]  in royal carrion style favorite weapon of lied the half wolf in defiance of the fate he was born to
[12227.35s -> 12233.83s]  lied for to serve no master but runny as proof the sword was imbued with a cold magic at the
[12233.83s -> 12240.36s]  moment the oath was sworn confuse the greatsword with frost and perform a forward somersault
[12240.36s -> 12251.30s]  i can't do it but that's cool that's a beautiful weapon
[12256.49s -> 12268.55s]  oh that's that's a beautiful weapon very cool so what about the armor i would feel kind of
[12268.55s -> 12281.32s]  icky putting on the armor don't you think so it feels like it doesn't feel right well worn
[12281.56s -> 12288.36s]  black armor of the man wolf blade pelters as a cape protecting from cold why was the blade of
[12288.36s -> 12296.50s]  ronnie but the cold bothered him anyway frozen reference does actually they actually put that
[12296.50s -> 12321.37s]  in that seems really out of place the cold bothered him anyway but um the scaled armor is better
[12321.93s -> 12331.59s]  just is gauntlets are good though the gauntlets on anything do i have anything better these are
[12331.59s -> 12346.09s]  still medium load scaled gauntlet this is better it just is oh but uh i can stay i could put blades
[12346.09s -> 12354.46s]  graves on still medium load yeah i think i feel like the scaled armor is some of the best armor
[12354.46s -> 12371.24s]  in the game very interesting very cool very cool okay george r.r. martin is a huge frozen fan really
[12371.24s -> 12379.03s]  that's funny all right that takes care of that should i go what about did i do all this there's
[12379.03s -> 12389.72s]  still this i don't understand this i don't know where this person is i don't know where
[12389.72s -> 12398.65s]  this person even is but i'll go see if he's in there go up and go to ronnie's go up to ronnie's
[12398.65s -> 12419.99s]  room i mean like up here go talk to the ronnie doll ronnie fell up here yeah i did i did ronnie's
[12419.99s -> 12457.77s]  quest i did complete ronnie's quest the whole thing not here did i not have this go to the
[12457.77s -> 12478.07s]  other tower oh i can get the grace why is my cam so small i don't want to take it up that much
[12478.07s -> 12488.87s]  space is some of this stuff to see on the screen okay so i can talk to the doll i take it thou has
[12488.87s -> 12498.49s]  noticed i shouldn't be surprised i thought i might expand a little further upon the order i envision
[12498.49s -> 12505.90s]  mine will be an order not of gold the stars and moon of the chill night i would keep them
[12505.90s -> 12514.06s]  far from the earth beneath our feet as it is now life and souls and order are bound tightly together
[12514.06s -> 12523.08s]  but i would have them at a great remove and have the certainties of sight emotion faith and touch
[12523.80s -> 12530.52s]  all become impossibilities which is why i would abandon this soil what with mine order
[12531.08s -> 12541.06s]  wouldst thou come to me even now a one and only lord you want to get rid of all of our
[12542.18s -> 12567.18s]  five senses touch sight smell taste gravity touch sight smell touch sight smell taste
[12568.06s -> 12585.18s]  what water hearing so she wants to remove all of our senses no i don't want to do that
[12585.74s -> 12590.97s]  wait you mean you tell you tell me i never be able to taste the steak again i don't know if we can
[12590.97s -> 12615.10s]  do that ronnie i don't think i can do that i got another great run he's making a utopia we don't
[12615.10s -> 12624.65s]  know that i walked through like a lake of rotten stuff grabbed a ring and put it on her finger and
[12624.65s -> 12639.85s]  i did all of a sudden i'm just supposed to trust everything that she says yes he wants to free the
[12639.85s -> 12663.27s]  souls what about what i want to do so i get to make a few stipulations here fuck again look if
[12663.27s -> 12668.79s]  i'm gonna do all the work um then i get to make a few like i get to make a few amendments to this
[12672.09s -> 12679.22s]  okay yeah you can remove all of our senses except for once on friday friday or sat on thursday we
[12679.22s -> 12693.34s]  get to taste food on thursday and then that that's fine i want once a week and i also require
[12693.90s -> 12698.84s]  it on thursday as well to get to be able to feel that feeling of really digging in deep and getting
[12698.84s -> 12703.35s]  a wicked huge booger out of your nose that's been bothering you for like an hour i want to
[12703.35s -> 12720.33s]  be able to have that feeling it feels great sometimes happens in the shower all right what
[12720.33s -> 12725.61s]  else do you want to do gold but the stars and the moon of the jits i don't want to be cold
[12725.61s -> 12735.42s]  chilly nights no and i would abandon this soil with my words thou come to me even now i don't
[12735.42s -> 12744.82s]  know about that it seems kind of like depressing it's like cold and dark not like i don't know i
[12744.82s -> 12753.58s]  don't know i don't like that chilly all right well that was that's kind of cool let's go that way
[12764.73s -> 12769.61s]  we know you're doing the dung eater ending i mean i don't even i don't know what ending i'm gonna do
[12770.41s -> 12776.01s]  all i'm saying is as of this moment right now i don't like being cold i keep my place pretty
[12776.01s -> 12781.51s]  warm we've had this conversation i don't want to be like freezing out and like some fucking
[12781.51s -> 12791.82s]  chilly night thing no i think 72 to 73 degrees i like i like it i like my place to be like 72
[12791.82s -> 12805.56s]  73 i like it hot okay let's go over here and see what's in that tower that's the correct
[12805.56s -> 12813.16s]  temperature you wouldn't believe how many people think i am an insane person for wanting to have
[12813.64s -> 12822.70s]  be like 73 degrees am i the crazy one somewhere between 73 and 74 i think is a perfect indoor
[12822.70s -> 12833.64s]  temperature is that that weird i don't think it is and i don't know how people oh yeah i like it i
[12833.64s -> 12845.96s]  like it like 63 64 i would die in that i would i would die in that temp 64 65 that's way too cold
[12847.40s -> 12865.46s]  62 60 no 68 okay i could understand 68 like 66 to 68 69 anything under 66 65 is that's
[12865.46s -> 12876.84s]  way 64 no way too cold i already did this so i'll just go in it so we can anything under 71
[12877.40s -> 12883.80s]  i'd say 70 is fine 70 is getting there but i think 68 is the lowest i would be like comfortable
[12884.52s -> 12892.34s]  maybe like a little higher less than 68 is also psychotic i would i you look oh yeah i did i did
[12892.34s -> 12907.83s]  sorry all right cool it's time uh it's time to go towards this what i assume is one of the final
[12907.83s -> 12928.66s]  areas of the game i'm gonna go for it let's do it i'm very excited oh i didn't go to that
[12929.38s -> 12949.58s]  me strong will take care of that all right so how do i get there i make this jump not that
[12949.58s -> 12968.90s]  i really want yeah and i it looks like i can be planning on beating the game tonight i would
[12968.90s -> 12981.56s]  highly highly doubt that i'm going to assume that this whole this this whole area up here
[12982.58s -> 12990.60s]  at the very least would take probably a whole stream but we'll see i i want to go take a look
[12990.60s -> 12999.83s]  it's at least probably three or four more streams yeah whatever i look i'm
[13002.06s -> 13006.86s]  there's always that theory right where oh uh i'm playing the same thing over and over again and
[13007.42s -> 13011.26s]  it's the same game and people are getting tired of the same game over and over and people want
[13011.26s -> 13016.87s]  to see something else and i i think this has been really great i've been having a great time
[13018.50s -> 13025.74s]  um so i don't have a reason not to just keep playing this until i am satisfied with it right
[13027.38s -> 13043.42s]  uh somebody said go to the one near the tree there's a lot of people here i i'm really actually
[13043.42s -> 13049.16s]  very very surprised at the amount of people that are here i was thinking right the first stream had
[13050.12s -> 13053.98s]  a lot like there was like 15 to 20 000 people on that first stream or two and it's like holy
[13053.98s -> 13059.82s]  shit that's an insane amount of people to watch me play elden ring there's still a lot of people
[13059.82s -> 13069.74s]  here um so not that i've paid that much attention to that but that number is i mean i was i did not
[13069.74s -> 13074.46s]  think this many people were gonna watch me of all people play this game because i yeah it's maybe
[13074.46s -> 13079.18s]  after the first like few streams or whatever okay but i'm still going and people are still here so
[13079.18s -> 13101.03s]  i'm gonna keep doing all right uh i need to head that way do i get over there go back to that
[13101.03s -> 13117.96s]  previous bonfire it's fun oh this it looks like a little place i can go can i go like down here
[13118.76s -> 13133.82s]  one of the northeast of the city is this one here or this one here yeah i can't get there from here
[13133.82s -> 13144.62s]  probably from here right yeah because i could go yeah this one randy's supposed to be saying
[13144.62s -> 13155.61s]  the literal opposite of what she says all right so now i gotta get down here
[13163.86s -> 13176.38s]  this one go back to the main street you want that central road that had the urn tree avatar in it
[13176.38s -> 13189.90s]  ah i have to go okay so i have to go down from here i gotta go like this way and then down and
[13189.90s -> 13208.68s]  around right i believe this is correct okay i know where i'm going use that blood key item
[13210.50s -> 13228.86s]  i don't want to summon mog in an elevator you want to see mog in an elevator then just wait
[13228.86s -> 13237.54s]  for when randomizer mods come out wait for like the bosses can be enemies mod okay so now we gotta
[13237.54s -> 13257.32s]  go this way here uh-huh already a thing i would i mean they all existed for dark souls 3 and dark
[13257.32s -> 13264.12s]  souls 1 there we go this is what we're doing now this is exactly okay so everybody freaked out when
[13264.12s -> 13266.92s]  i walked down here because they were like dude wrong way so now this is the right way
[13267.64s -> 13284.25s]  i think i already did a little bit of this so let's go let's just go what level am i
[13284.81s -> 13296.62s]  i am level 109 which i believe puts me in level zone with this upcoming end game content area
[13297.26s -> 13309.00s]  i would take a guess well i guess i did that the fucking complete wrong direction
[13309.88s -> 13316.68s]  all right stop being lazy and fight them you are lazy you could have had that easily
[13316.68s -> 13324.90s]  i'm just like the fucking laziest sorcerer in the world just like with my bubble wand just
[13325.70s -> 13352.02s]  hopping around like an idiot yeah i got this too you're right i'm gonna go to bog stream instead
[13364.46s -> 13380.39s]  i have a few unpowered ruins i do i really do oh what a pain i should i really should have just
[13383.24s -> 13388.36s]  godrix is still one of the best when i got the other one and i looked at it it seemed like
[13388.36s -> 13393.35s]  it was just better than the other one in every way godrix increases all your stats by five
[13394.23s -> 13400.15s]  and renales increases your health fp and stamina but that's already happening with
[13401.03s -> 13406.60s]  godrix plus five on like endurance and shit right it almost feels like not unnecessary
[13415.70s -> 13421.94s]  yeah i i know i have to i haven't been using any rune arcs it's bad they would i do i gotta
[13421.94s -> 13433.48s]  start using them for bosses remind me literally the best move in the fucking whole game
[13438.94s -> 13473.45s]  there's one of these guys here that goes far as fuck what i was just in awe of how crazy that
[13473.45s -> 13524.50s]  move is is there another one good move wait a minute wait a minute i i need to look at
[13524.50s -> 13553.18s]  something strengthens cold sorcery that counts right so is two intelligence more than what this
[13553.18s -> 13560.58s]  would give to that spell or is this better i don't i don't know what how much percentage whatever that
[13560.58s -> 13575.46s]  means not at your level okay oh okay so i was doing like 350 before i wonder how much it does
[13575.46s -> 13587.14s]  now that's gonna be better is there anything else that does that okay great i don't think i care
[13587.14s -> 13604.95s]  about hp vastly raises maximum fp i already have that on is anything else boost fp no i already
[13604.95s -> 13612.25s]  have a lot of this on do i have anything else potency of sorceries that would count right
[13612.89s -> 13631.67s]  okay do i have anything else i think i want to keep the staff on though and listen one of these
[13631.67s -> 13645.21s]  boost cold sorcery which would be a huge deal it's a glint blade sorcery enhances crystalline
[13645.21s -> 13663.30s]  sorcery not cold let's find out let's take a look at the offices renalis staff does full moon spell
[13663.86s -> 13681.90s]  i don't think i have that no i don't it's a remembrance but i can go to one of those bells
[13681.90s -> 13691.03s]  and get it can i i didn't use any of the bell demon things i mean i might have to go do that
[13691.59s -> 13709.67s]  because that i'm into that that's cool you need 60 into staff i have 55 right now
[13713.54s -> 13723.83s]  though it's not like i won't get there or i could take a rune because i'm very curious because this
[13723.83s -> 13729.56s]  move is insane that move might actually replace how i feel about the baby rattle
[13730.28s -> 13739.91s]  because so far the this has been carrying for essentially the last 30 game hours it's an awesome
[13739.91s -> 13759.00s]  move but if that move is that good which it is i think i'm gonna have to use it lame drake talisman
[13759.00s -> 13779.06s]  one the glint stone uh from cell yeah yeah yeah maybe usat staff is the highest damage staff in
[13779.06s -> 13789.80s]  the game yeah but me i don't have to do the best you know it's not about what the best item is it's
[13789.80s -> 13797.50s]  what how much fun you have with whatever you're doing i need to one all right sneak
[13800.33s -> 13830.31s]  i can get it don't kill me here this guy's on a horse knight's great sword oh can i get it i can't
[13830.31s -> 13838.94s]  get on a horse here why he's allowed on a horse that's not fair one's just better but it's fun
[13838.94s -> 13856.54s]  to i like the i like the staff it's cool i don't matter i do have enough mana to cast this right now
[13856.54s -> 13869.08s]  okay cool shit
[13881.13s -> 13919.99s]  tuber reaction remember you have stylized shots for fp regen oh i do you're right is it retreat

[13956.70s -> 13968.52s]  okay it's literally the same exact entrance nobody noticed um yeah some people did it's why you said
[13968.52s -> 13988.76s]  it just for people to understand that like i'm not making shit up like i'm not hello well it's not
[13988.76s -> 13996.25s]  gonna get bigger are you can i get something else that's not five and six smithing stones
[13996.81s -> 14003.90s]  i feel like this probably bonfire soon i'm not gonna do a starlight shard

[14173.56s -> 14184.78s]  the wall that doesn't make any sense i was trying to run against the wall so i could just go right
[14184.78s -> 14202.55s]  into the so i wouldn't have to jump and get it wrong it's right here it's literally like the first

[14664.66s -> 14682.04s]  hey you should all go do it right now stop what you're doing right now and go sub to atriach
[14682.04s -> 14696.76s]  on youtube do it right now it'll take you two seconds i'll come right back in fact leave me

[14703.16s -> 14706.52s]  in like the two seconds you're in the tab right now right good i'm just walking around
[14707.08s -> 14733.26s]  what the fuck what the fuck oh my god that was fucking insane so whose run is this
[14739.30s -> 14755.74s]  tab is i don't i never did this what does his run do greatly raises max hp but by how much though
[14758.76s -> 14768.47s]  raises i feel like they kind of feel like they kind of botched this in a way because raises all
[14768.47s -> 14777.96s]  attributes raises health raises max health raises health raises health raises health like i feel like
[14777.96s -> 14786.63s]  i wish these were a little different they all kind of do the same thing but maybe some do it a little
[14786.63s -> 14790.94s]  bit better than the others i would like i would have loved it if it was like this one is all
[14790.94s -> 14797.66s]  attributes this one is you do more damage but take more damage this one is your fp uh the
[14797.66s -> 14804.14s]  cost spell costs are cut in half or something right these all kind of feel way too similar
[14804.14s -> 14814.38s]  they're just talismans for that these feel very similar like that raises max hp fp and stamina
[14814.38s -> 14821.86s]  raises max hp it's like why would you use this one i feel like they keep getting slowly worse
[14826.62s -> 14834.34s]  unless that's an insane amount you get to choose what an ember does
[14835.54s -> 14841.14s]  yeah i mean it's it's it's cool but i think that's the i think that part of the game for me is
[14841.86s -> 14853.29s]  feels the like the least kind of interesting it's not that much of a complaint though considering
[14856.06s -> 14864.38s]  your health bar will cover the entire screen well that's cool um we can keep going is there
[14864.38s -> 14869.59s]  anything else here that i need to see or is that it you sometimes these towers have weird shit in
[14869.59s -> 14889.46s]  them mog is here mog is not here yeah you have to use the rune arc i just have i'm just not using
[14889.46s -> 14896.79s]  them what does he hate this game because it was hyped up and i all the hype fucking failed man
[14900.60s -> 14908.28s]  like look i mean look at how big this map is it's annoying it's annoying it's like too much
[14908.28s -> 14913.67s]  it's like too much stuff to see they should have just had it like be this area here and
[14913.67s -> 14919.34s]  like this is dlc and shit like this is just like fucking stupid all this up here is just like i
[14919.34s -> 14923.78s]  don't know it's like a waste of time they could have like condensed this and made it like limb
[14923.78s -> 14929.24s]  grave and caitlin and that would have been much better like hyped up fucking hype is so dumb
[14929.88s -> 14944.84s]  all right let me rest here yeah you're you're you're going this is why like game design is so
[14944.84s -> 14951.50s]  fucking stupid you expect me as a player to go like walk from here if like and eventually go
[14951.50s -> 14956.66s]  like spend all the time to go all the way up here i just don't i don't understand where like where
[14956.66s -> 14969.45s]  the time they think they think we have the time for this it's way too far i'm just spending these
[14969.45s -> 14990.34s]  ruins oh this is cool why don't they let you just buy ruins with money i know it's like what if i
[14990.34s -> 14996.34s]  don't fucking want to get ruins i should be able to spend 9.99 and get like you know 30 40 000 souls
[14999.83s -> 15027.72s]  that was awful this should be loot boxes you just open up to get armor the move is okay is this
[15027.72s -> 15044.12s]  seriously elden bucks let me actually go down here is there a map fragment yet no not quite
[15044.84s -> 15054.65s]  you have a horse i know but i don't want to just like this is a cool area i don't want to
[15054.65s -> 15060.74s]  just run around and forget i don't want to just fucking forget where i'm not seeing anything and
[15060.74s -> 15075.66s]  miss everything i would have missed that if i got on the horse this is this game just reminds me
[15075.66s -> 15079.82s]  when video games would just fucking video games video games are just allowed to be video games
[15079.82s -> 15103.10s]  that was it i love how i've turned for you guys like the boston accent guy into things that like
[15103.10s -> 15107.82s]  i'm allowed to kind of come out of my like i can just say whatever i want as that voice that
[15107.90s -> 15114.46s]  character and it's universally despised anything i say so it's like i don't know it's kind of like
[15114.46s -> 15118.94s]  kind of relieving and almost like liberating in a way that i can just fucking go like this and say
[15118.94s -> 15122.78s]  whatever i fucking want and like we all know it's not real and we can all it doesn't matter i can
[15122.78s -> 15129.93s]  say anything i don't know why it has to be like the boston guy with the cigarette outside of a cvs
[15129.93s -> 15137.40s]  like i don't know why it has to be that guy like i don't know why that person in my brain has a
[15137.40s -> 15143.96s]  tank top a cigarette short sandals sitting outside of a cvs with a gatorade in the other hand
[15143.96s -> 15148.92s]  and like you're walking into the cvs and he's just like i fucking i don't know why that you
[15148.92s -> 15154.17s]  can't just buy fucking rooms with money like all right yeah all right man like i don't know why
[15154.17s -> 15157.77s]  that's who i see that's what happens i don't know why that's that's how i feel what would happen
[15159.93s -> 15164.01s]  and you just go you go into the cvs and then you leave and that guy just kind of shows up
[15164.01s -> 15171.30s]  everywhere in random places you know like that that guy you could be at line at the deli and
[15171.30s -> 15175.03s]  he'll just turn around and he still has cigarette in his hand by the way and like they haven't
[15175.03s -> 15182.18s]  thrown him out yet he's like damn i wish they were fucking two drive-throughs three drive-through
[15182.18s -> 15193.82s]  windows instead of one at like every restaurant all right dude like okay it's just like a bot
[15193.82s -> 15201.88s]  the boston npc guy you just you could just say pretty much whatever you want as boston
[15201.88s -> 15219.66s]  like gta character and that's it and here this way okay why is the tank top gas station cigarette
[15219.74s -> 15233.58s]  boston guy invested in elden ring i don't know he just he's invested in everything and he would
[15233.58s -> 15239.93s]  always be like like it would always be after the after he sucks it in right like hey what's up man
[15241.75s -> 15247.77s]  see the price of bitcoin like he would talk when it was in his lungs and then you would see it
[15247.77s -> 15255.98s]  trailing out slow like it that there's a person that just lives in my head completely rent-free
[15255.98s -> 15258.14s]  it just does it all right easy easy easy
[15268.95s -> 15273.82s]  don't you think they should fucking decentralize cbs this is my god what the

[18056.10s -> 18064.60s]  to stream tomorrow which is technically today but i just had the craving i had to play i think we
[18064.60s -> 18076.54s]  made some pretty good progress i mean i got pretty far i think this is still a lot to do over here
[18076.54s -> 18084.62s]  and probably even back here too i also maybe want to go back to the sewer because he was like oh
[18084.62s -> 18097.61s]  converse with the three fingers three fingers two fingers it's a hand right like that makes sense
[18097.61s -> 18105.14s]  doesn't it why would there be two fingers and three fingers was it the same hand whose hand
[18105.14s -> 18110.18s]  is that why is there two hands is more than two hands like somebody have two hands like some
[18110.90s -> 18125.42s]  giant god or something uh we'll go back to it i'll see you guys on thursday i all right let me ask
