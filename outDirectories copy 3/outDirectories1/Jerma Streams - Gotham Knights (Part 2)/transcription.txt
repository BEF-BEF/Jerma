[3.13s -> 12.31s]  I am back. Who's ready for Gotham Knights?
[16.18s -> 27.64s]  Did I scare you? I didn't mean to. Yeah, so I went to the bathroom, filled up my drink.
[27.64s -> 38.14s]  Very cool. Get the audio going. Make sure you can hear this.
[38.14s -> 44.70s]  All right, it's time to begin. This is a sponsored segment of today's stream.
[44.70s -> 61.35s]  Like yesterday. Fix the BRB music. Yeah, I know.
[61.35s -> 74.44s]  Okay, let me make sure you can see it. There we go.
[75.46s -> 83.21s]  All right, let's get this over here. Where am I? Where did I go?
[83.21s -> 87.78s]  There I am. Facing the wrong direction. Let's flip that.
[92.97s -> 106.12s]  Bang. And now you will be able to see the game. There.
[109.34s -> 114.28s]  All right. We played yesterday. We were playing as Nightwing.
[114.28s -> 115.96s]  We're going to play as a different character today.
[116.76s -> 120.04s]  Thank you to Warner Brothers for sponsoring this part of the stream.
[120.04s -> 122.36s]  The game is out right now. It's out now.
[123.77s -> 130.66s]  Gotham Knights is on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S, Series X, and PC.
[131.38s -> 149.43s]  What was the last thing we did? All right, what character should I play as?
[149.99s -> 153.21s]  I want to play as a different character.
[153.21s -> 157.02s]  And I guess the question is, how do you change a character?
[157.02s -> 162.18s]  Play Red Hood? How do you change character?
[167.22s -> 168.66s]  Red Hood? All right, we'll do Red Hood today.
[175.08s -> 175.88s]  You have to ask.
[180.20s -> 184.20s]  There's definitely a way to do it, right? Did I not unlock that part yet?
[186.70s -> 189.83s]  Is it on the workbench? Do a poll?
[190.94s -> 192.22s]  Actually, you know what? All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[192.22s -> 196.06s]  Let's do a poll. I want to play as a different character.
[196.06s -> 203.62s]  So do you want Robin, Red Hood, or Batgirl? Let's get a poll.
[213.19s -> 214.71s]  All right, let's open the Batcomputer.
[214.71s -> 217.27s]  So all right, yeah, this is the last thing we just did.
[217.27s -> 220.07s]  Harley Quinn called from Blackgate Penitentiary.
[224.63s -> 227.03s]  Oh, you have to go to the suits. All right, well, let's go take a look.
[227.03s -> 230.15s]  I'll give you a nice look at it so you can see what you're getting into here.
[231.19s -> 233.35s]  Suits are... Where are they? Here they are.
[233.99s -> 235.35s]  Okay, here you go.
[236.76s -> 238.92s]  We've been playing as Nightwing. We're going to play somebody else.
[238.92s -> 247.86s]  Robin. Robin has the big bow staff, and it's Robin.
[247.86s -> 252.82s]  Batgirl has... I think she throws stuff to get like...
[252.90s -> 271.50s]  Red Hood has guns, I think. What character are we doing?
[271.50s -> 274.78s]  Dude, Red Hood has guns. Yeah, whatever.
[282.70s -> 286.70s]  It's neck and neck. Batgirl and Red Hood. Robin is in last.
[289.13s -> 292.09s]  A lot of people are really kind of sleeping on Robin here.
[292.09s -> 293.70s]  I think Robin's probably going to be really good.
[305.62s -> 307.94s]  All right. Is it really that close? I can't see.
[311.62s -> 314.42s]  It's too close. Well, we're not doing it again.
[314.42s -> 338.18s]  Who's winning? 47%. That was close.
[338.18s -> 342.49s]  That was very close. Let me just tweet.
[342.49s -> 347.51s]  All right, we're doing Red Hood.
[360.60s -> 361.48s]  I threw? How?
[363.48s -> 364.76s]  Oh, all right. I probably should have done this.
[367.74s -> 372.06s]  Brute Strength Powerhouse Brawler Master Marksman 27 Power.
[372.06s -> 372.70s]  I should have done this.
[374.22s -> 377.66s]  Expert Hacker Tough as Nails Single Target Bruiser.
[378.63s -> 380.71s]  Well, we're doing it. Let's do Red Hood.
[393.10s -> 406.62s]  Oh, my. He's huge. He's massive.
[408.39s -> 411.35s]  All right. Let's start the patrol.
[413.88s -> 416.33s]  Oh, so yeah, I have a panel.
[416.33s -> 418.57s]  If you're interested, click the panel. Click the panel image.
[419.88s -> 422.65s]  You can buy it. Pre-order it.
[422.65s -> 424.49s]  Although the pre-order is over. I mean, it's out now.
[424.49s -> 438.55s]  It's literally out right now.
[438.55s -> 439.75s]  All right. I'm ready to begin.
[440.47s -> 443.19s]  Again, thank you Warner Brothers, sponsored.
[443.91s -> 446.31s]  Let's go. Time to protect Gotham City.
[449.34s -> 450.70s]  In case you want to use that anywhere.
[450.70s -> 452.94s]  Like you're absolutely more than welcome to.
[452.94s -> 454.70s]  You can if you want to use that clip.
[454.70s -> 456.30s]  Me, you know, get ready.
[461.58s -> 462.46s]  All right. I'm excited.
[462.46s -> 464.46s]  Actually, right when I started having fun
[464.46s -> 466.78s]  at Internet Problems last night, and that's not here right now.
[466.78s -> 472.84s]  So let's go. What is Red Hood's moves?
[473.48s -> 480.22s]  Wait, I should look at. Hold on.
[480.22s -> 483.64s]  I want to see the. What's he got?
[483.64s -> 485.32s]  Abilities. All right. Hold on.
[485.32s -> 489.18s]  I have two points to put in because from my understanding,
[489.18s -> 490.78s]  when you level up any character,
[491.34s -> 493.66s]  you level all of them up essentially at the same time.
[493.66s -> 496.70s]  I guess that's to prevent you playing through the whole game
[496.70s -> 497.42s]  and being like, you know what?
[497.42s -> 500.14s]  I want to play as Batgirl, but I'm literally at zero
[500.14s -> 501.50s]  and I can't do anything.
[501.50s -> 504.46s]  So we have marksman, brawler and vengeance.
[504.46s -> 505.18s]  We have two points.
[506.94s -> 508.78s]  Red Hood performs a perfectly timed evade
[508.78s -> 509.58s]  that generates momentum.
[509.58s -> 514.26s]  We have that also critical damage by 20 percent.
[515.48s -> 518.76s]  Red Hood can aim longer at a target to deal four times damage.
[518.76s -> 519.96s]  I think that's what I want.
[519.96s -> 520.68s]  Should we do guns?
[523.94s -> 524.90s]  Definitely. I mean, perfect evade.
[524.90s -> 528.02s]  You need it and then guns.
[528.02s -> 530.34s]  If you the longer you aim, you do more damage.
[531.75s -> 537.19s]  Done. What are the other ones?
[537.19s -> 538.63s]  When Red Hood throws an enemy,
[538.63s -> 541.67s]  he attaches a concussion mine to them that explodes.
[541.67s -> 543.37s]  That's pretty good.
[543.37s -> 544.41s]  That's three points.
[544.97s -> 549.78s]  Okay. I feel like I'm going to like this character.
[549.78s -> 553.46s]  Let's see. Is there like a little crime I can do just to learn his moveset?
[554.10s -> 556.63s]  There's got to be like a crime going on.
[556.63s -> 557.19s]  Yeah, over here.
[569.93s -> 570.73s]  Oh, shit. What happened?
[572.55s -> 574.23s]  No, get off the bike. What are you doing?
[575.11s -> 579.45s]  What happened? What happened here?
[580.01s -> 582.26s]  Do you need help? How do I help?
[583.85s -> 584.97s]  Was I too late?
[585.85s -> 587.32s]  How was I too late?
[588.68s -> 590.04s]  Did the criminals already get away?
[590.68s -> 597.51s]  I'm such a shitty superhero.
[598.31s -> 599.03s]  Get back on the bike.
[611.53s -> 612.49s]  All right. Here we are.
[613.77s -> 617.18s]  Quiet. All right.
[617.18s -> 618.22s]  I'm going to dismount. Let's go.
[622.09s -> 623.61s]  I'm getting like texts.
[623.61s -> 625.53s]  My phone is just blowing up right now.
[626.49s -> 627.77s]  Red Hood, where are you, man?
[629.40s -> 632.84s]  Red Hood, your location says that you're over by like the...
[633.88s -> 635.96s]  Where are you? You're going the wrong way, dude.
[635.96s -> 638.90s]  Why does it say you're inside of the museum?
[641.75s -> 642.79s]  Just make a bunch of shit up.
[643.35s -> 645.62s]  I actually don't know where the fuck I'm going.
[646.18s -> 660.68s]  There we go.
[660.68s -> 661.80s]  Okay, let's go.
[668.50s -> 669.94s]  What? Why am I shooting behind me?
[675.00s -> 675.56s]  How do I shoot?
[678.23s -> 679.11s]  All right, that's pretty cool.
[681.45s -> 683.29s]  Okay, this is awesome.
[684.01s -> 693.40s]  Man, is somebody just shooting at you?
[694.04s -> 702.30s]  What is this move?
[707.10s -> 710.87s]  Put this camera away.
[723.30s -> 724.42s]  I didn't even need to fucking look.
[725.22s -> 739.38s]  They're not even paying attention.
[748.92s -> 749.88s]  Yeah, I got a gun too.
[758.31s -> 758.81s]  Huh?
[765.11s -> 766.47s]  All right, I think I got the move set down.
[767.03s -> 770.84s]  I got points for that, right?
[772.74s -> 774.34s]  Paul Nightwing, he's crying.
[774.98s -> 777.14s]  No, we're Red Hood friends.
[777.14s -> 777.64s]  No.
[779.70s -> 780.26s]  All right, I get it.
[780.26s -> 780.98s]  I get the move set.
[782.74s -> 783.78s]  I want to level those guns up.
[785.06s -> 786.98s]  By the way, there's gear in the game too.
[786.98s -> 789.99s]  So he doesn't have any gear.
[791.19s -> 791.69s]  Right.
[792.07s -> 792.55s]  Okay.
[792.55s -> 794.63s]  Well, I guess I do have better stuff.
[795.19s -> 796.39s]  So these are better pistols.
[799.61s -> 802.41s]  We're going with the Beyond Suit.
[802.89s -> 805.85s]  I probably should have put the gear on before attacking anybody.
[808.73s -> 810.65s]  And what else?
[810.65s -> 811.15s]  Melee.
[811.77s -> 816.23s]  Cool.
[816.23s -> 817.11s]  All right, that's better.
[827.93s -> 828.65s]  All right, Harley Quinn.
[829.21s -> 832.57s]  I love how everybody can do a wheelie.
[833.29s -> 843.59s]  I thought I could grab something.
[853.05s -> 854.73s]  I bet Robin can't do a wheelie.
[854.73s -> 855.29s]  Oh, please.
[856.17s -> 857.05s]  We'll find out.
[857.61s -> 863.40s]  Is Harley Quinn just sitting?
[863.40s -> 864.52s]  No, isn't Harley Quinn in the...
[877.99s -> 879.27s]  All right, let's do it.
[879.83s -> 881.99s]  This is probably a boss of some kind, I imagine.
[882.79s -> 887.59s]  That's this suit does look awesome.
[888.23s -> 892.52s]  And you see somebody walking down the fucking street like this?
[903.11s -> 904.23s]  Do an E3 walk.
[905.94s -> 906.44s]  What?
[908.12s -> 909.08s]  Wait, I'm not supposed to...
[909.08s -> 910.20s]  Oh, I'm not supposed to be here?
[911.08s -> 914.86s]  I'm not supposed to be here.
[916.70s -> 919.82s]  I'm just a guy in a huge superhero costume.
[919.82s -> 921.66s]  Just walking in the front door.
[927.51s -> 928.55s]  Ah, yeah.
[928.55s -> 931.43s]  Yeah, we got a guy in a fucking superhero outfit.
[932.15s -> 933.19s]  Walking into the front door.
[933.83s -> 934.55s]  Looks like he's armed.
[935.19s -> 935.99s]  How do we proceed?
[940.06s -> 940.94s]  What would you even say?
[953.46s -> 959.48s]  All right, let's do it.
[959.48s -> 972.46s]  Cassane, find a way into the prison.
[972.46s -> 985.74s]  I guess I have to get in here.
[987.06s -> 988.50s]  Belfry, I got in.
[988.50s -> 990.26s]  Next stop, Harley Cell.
[991.37s -> 996.01s]  The X on her map corresponds to Cell Block 3 past Nexus processing.
[996.65s -> 1000.09s]  The guards have withdrawn their patrols from that block.
[1000.09s -> 1000.59s]  All right, let's...
[1001.23s -> 1004.27s]  So there's no telling how bad things have gotten in there.
[1004.27s -> 1005.23s]  Are there guards in here?
[1006.35s -> 1021.21s]  Sure, he did.
[1021.21s -> 1025.02s]  I missed.
[1042.04s -> 1042.68s]  I'm getting another...
[1046.52s -> 1047.16s]  Red Hood, man!
[1047.16s -> 1047.88s]  What are you doing in there?
[1048.60s -> 1057.15s]  Wait, I shouldn't be...
[1057.15s -> 1057.95s]  We can't let Red Hood...
[1057.95s -> 1066.52s]  Am I gonna open this door with my bare hands?
[1067.64s -> 1068.14s]  Oh.
[1084.33s -> 1105.26s]  Wait, interrogate.
[1106.64s -> 1107.92s]  Interrogate, interrogate.
[1107.92s -> 1108.42s]  Did I?
[1112.24s -> 1112.96s]  I can't interrogate.
[1124.94s -> 1126.14s]  You've interrogated.
[1126.70s -> 1128.43s]  I love when he does the lip thing.
[1128.43s -> 1128.93s]  What do I do?
[1129.63s -> 1132.11s]  Yeah, Mike, I don't know why.
[1132.11s -> 1133.63s]  Whenever I play Gotham Knights...
[1137.05s -> 1138.41s]  I wonder why my webcam does this.
[1143.04s -> 1144.72s]  Well, this webcam stinks.
[1145.28s -> 1148.64s]  I don't think I want to do this.
[1153.58s -> 1154.94s]  Avoid taking damage.
[1154.94s -> 1157.02s]  Defeat all the invades and don't take any damage.
[1157.58s -> 1160.43s]  That's gonna be kind of hard.
[1160.43s -> 1162.67s]  All right, let me see if I can take some out before we get noticed.
[1163.39s -> 1167.36s]  And then let me play the stealth aspects of this game the way I'm supposed to.
[1171.61s -> 1173.45s]  Well, don't slam him on the ground.
[1174.09s -> 1175.05s]  Oh, shit.
[1175.93s -> 1186.49s]  Is there somebody just puke?
[1188.75s -> 1189.95s]  I think somebody just threw up.
[1204.32s -> 1205.20s]  Oh, no!
[1205.76s -> 1206.48s]  Whatever.
[1206.48s -> 1228.22s]  Did I shoot him in the face when I did that?
[1228.22s -> 1228.86s]  Holy shit.
[1229.82s -> 1246.84s]  Get out of here!
[1247.48s -> 1261.16s]  Fucking scoop slam.
[1261.88s -> 1270.75s]  You were trying to...
[1270.75s -> 1272.43s]  Pursue him into the fire.
[1272.43s -> 1273.95s]  I was trying to go for an environmental...
[1274.67s -> 1276.32s]  Wait, is this it?
[1276.96s -> 1285.31s]  What do you know?
[1302.88s -> 1304.32s]  I feel like I would do something like that.
[1305.12s -> 1306.88s]  Looks like you've been eaten well.
[1308.38s -> 1311.10s]  Still as big as an ox and twice as mean.
[1314.57s -> 1317.42s]  Been a while, you good?
[1319.31s -> 1320.19s]  So it is different.
[1320.19s -> 1322.03s]  Was it too much to ask you to visit earlier?
[1324.17s -> 1327.21s]  So each character has different dialogue with every encounter.
[1327.21s -> 1327.93s]  That's kind of cool.
[1329.28s -> 1330.00s]  What was it?
[1332.41s -> 1338.78s]  Hayden.
[1338.78s -> 1339.42s]  Are you real?
[1351.71s -> 1354.91s]  He asked me to profile some criminals.
[1355.55s -> 1359.23s]  On account of my being a brilliant psychiatrist.
[1361.44s -> 1362.96s]  Guess of all the criminals he knew...
[1363.77s -> 1365.21s]  You'd be the one to ask.
[1365.21s -> 1365.71s]  Hey!
[1366.25s -> 1367.93s]  I am not a criminal!
[1368.73s -> 1370.97s]  I'm misunderstood.
[1370.97s -> 1372.25s]  She's got a board up there too.
[1373.61s -> 1374.11s]  Look.
[1375.47s -> 1376.75s]  You know what I'm here for.
[1376.75s -> 1379.26s]  Hand it over.
[1379.26s -> 1385.00s]  He just grabbed the bars and he just rips the bars off the fucking wall
[1385.00s -> 1386.84s]  and he's got the whole thing in his hands and just throws it behind him.
[1388.91s -> 1393.95s]  But I'm missing my piece de resistance.
[1393.95s -> 1399.45s]  I need you to follow up on this here card.
[1405.61s -> 1406.49s]  It's hard to catch paper.
[1406.49s -> 1406.97s]  Holy shit.
[1406.97s -> 1409.61s]  That's the most impressive thing that we've seen a superhero do for the last two days.
[1409.61s -> 1410.65s]  You're not making this easy for me.
[1411.68s -> 1412.80s]  It should be done in records.
[1419.52s -> 1420.16s]  Bye.
[1420.16s -> 1438.24s]  Okay.
[1438.78s -> 1442.20s]  Exit cell.
[1442.20s -> 1442.68s]  Block three.
[1442.68s -> 1443.88s]  So we're gonna go get whatever this is?
[1444.60s -> 1445.96s]  They're the inmates from the corridor.
[1445.96s -> 1446.76s]  All right.
[1446.76s -> 1447.57s]  We got it.
[1461.13s -> 1468.56s]  That guy's gonna accidentally hit me in the head.
[1470.32s -> 1471.68s]  Can he hit me in the head accidentally?
[1472.40s -> 1475.82s]  He's gonna like he's gonna hit me with his backswing.
[1480.64s -> 1481.52s]  Oh god damn it.
[1481.52s -> 1490.78s]  I'm glitching out.
[1490.78s -> 1491.90s]  I'm phasing out of reality.
[1492.54s -> 1504.16s]  Okay.
[1504.16s -> 1504.96s]  Just get across.
[1515.55s -> 1516.05s]  All right.
[1517.31s -> 1530.78s]  All right.
[1530.78s -> 1531.58s]  I'm good.
[1531.58s -> 1539.96s]  The camera's fucked up.
[1539.96s -> 1541.48s]  There's an elevator in the nexus.
[1541.48s -> 1543.00s]  Maybe that goes down the basement.
[1543.72s -> 1546.17s]  What the heck's wrong with my camera?
[1546.81s -> 1552.65s]  Let's keep doing that.
[1553.21s -> 1564.48s]  Dude, you need more RAM.
[1564.48s -> 1565.68s]  Your VTuber model is...
[1567.69s -> 1568.81s]  Holy shit.
[1568.81s -> 1569.31s]  Okay.
[1575.82s -> 1576.54s]  Oh my god.
[1577.76s -> 1578.24s]  Okay.
[1578.24s -> 1579.20s]  Momentum ability.
[1579.20s -> 1582.72s]  Enemy armored attacks can only be interrupted with piercing abilities such as barrage.
[1583.60s -> 1584.57s]  Gain momentum.
[1584.57s -> 1585.29s]  And then I got...
[1585.29s -> 1585.53s]  Okay.
[1585.53s -> 1586.17s]  I have a new move.
[1586.73s -> 1595.44s]  Holy shit, dude.
[1595.44s -> 1597.20s]  I shot you like 50 times.
[1615.47s -> 1616.35s]  Shoot behind you.
[1616.35s -> 1617.15s]  Why am I not...
[1617.15s -> 1618.35s]  I'm so stupid.
[1618.35s -> 1619.07s]  I'm trying to aim.
[1632.28s -> 1632.76s]  Geez.
[1632.76s -> 1633.00s]  All right.
[1633.00s -> 1633.50s]  Go.
[1634.04s -> 1647.00s]  I'm gonna get hit once.
[1647.00s -> 1654.14s]  Mm-hmm.
[1656.11s -> 1677.07s]  Oh.
[1678.40s -> 1682.70s]  Another one.
[1682.70s -> 1683.26s]  Oh my god.
[1683.26s -> 1684.22s]  You're gonna get me in two hits.
[1691.69s -> 1692.25s]  Don't kill me.
[1697.23s -> 1697.95s]  Oh my god.
[1698.35s -> 1700.59s]  Rocks.
[1701.23s -> 1706.33s]  Why would I have to defeat the guards?
[1707.87s -> 1708.37s]  Really?
[1708.99s -> 1709.60s]  No.
[1709.60s -> 1709.92s]  Why...
[1709.92s -> 1710.80s]  Defeat the guards?
[1710.80s -> 1711.30s]  I...
[1712.14s -> 1712.78s]  All right.
[1712.78s -> 1713.26s]  Fine.
[1713.26s -> 1713.66s]  Okay.
[1713.66s -> 1714.16s]  I'll defeat...
[1721.87s -> 1722.99s]  You actually got a hit on me.
[1726.49s -> 1726.99s]  Okay.
[1727.45s -> 1751.93s]  The guards don't even have weapons.
[1752.41s -> 1752.73s]  I know.
[1752.73s -> 1753.61s]  This is so unfair.
[1754.49s -> 1759.58s]  Come here.
[1759.58s -> 1763.69s]  Had a choke slam.
[1763.69s -> 1764.81s]  That was fucking sick.
[1765.53s -> 1779.10s]  Yeah, like those guys have bare fists.
[1779.82s -> 1786.76s]  I don't want anything to do with this.
[1786.76s -> 1787.96s]  I have no more healing, by the way.
[1787.96s -> 1788.52s]  This is bad.
[1793.72s -> 1795.88s]  Why would I even fight them?
[1796.60s -> 1800.80s]  I'm all right.
[1801.34s -> 1810.35s]  How do you get more heals?
[1810.35s -> 1811.31s]  Are they just consumables?
[1816.96s -> 1817.28s]  Ooh.
[1817.28s -> 1817.78s]  Chest.
[1829.80s -> 1833.87s]  Can you stealth take down the big enemies?
[1834.67s -> 1854.36s]  He fell down.
[1855.00s -> 1868.70s]  Turn around.
[1868.70s -> 1873.79s]  Turn around.
[1879.16s -> 1895.55s]  Unload.
[1895.55s -> 1895.87s]  Unload.
[1895.87s -> 1896.19s]  Unload.
[1896.19s -> 1896.59s]  Unload.
[1896.59s -> 1896.91s]  Unload.
[1896.91s -> 1897.23s]  Unload.
[1897.23s -> 1898.19s]  Unload.
[1898.19s -> 1907.02s]  I'm trying to get the perfect strikes.
[1907.02s -> 1908.22s]  It's hard to do with Red Hood.
[1908.94s -> 1924.88s]  Don't let him put the shield up.
[1925.60s -> 1926.24s]  Oh.
[1926.24s -> 1940.25s]  Low with the difficulty.
[1940.25s -> 1940.49s]  No.
[1940.49s -> 1940.73s]  No.
[1940.73s -> 1942.01s]  It's got to stay at hard.
[1942.01s -> 1946.54s]  All right.
[1946.54s -> 1947.02s]  Records room.
[1952.43s -> 1954.51s]  Shoot them when they have the red flashing.
[1954.51s -> 1960.33s]  Too smart to just send me on an errand after an old file.
[1961.05s -> 1962.49s]  What do you want me to find out?
[1964.91s -> 1966.03s]  You're a hard gamer.
[1966.03s -> 1966.27s]  Yeah.
[1968.32s -> 1969.92s]  I play games on hard.
[1969.92s -> 1971.04s]  No, actually, I kind of don't.
[1971.04s -> 1975.63s]  There's something more in this catalog.
[1975.63s -> 1976.03s]  Oh.
[1976.03s -> 1983.92s]  Chest over there.
[1983.92s -> 1985.68s]  They're bullet spongy on hard.
[1985.68s -> 1993.29s]  It's got to get better weapons.
[1993.29s -> 1994.73s]  Find and examine marked items.
[1994.73s -> 1995.23s]  Okay.
[1995.69s -> 2001.64s]  Prisoner profile.
[2001.64s -> 2002.52s]  Cyrus Gold.
[2002.52s -> 2003.56s]  Convict, they say.
[2003.56s -> 2004.44s]  Crook, they say.
[2004.44s -> 2005.24s]  Murderer, they say.
[2005.64s -> 2007.48s]  But soon peace will be mine.
[2007.48s -> 2008.36s]  Died on Saturday.
[2008.36s -> 2009.24s]  Buried on Sunday.
[2009.24s -> 2010.04s]  Born on Monday.
[2010.04s -> 2010.92s]  They have no idea.
[2010.92s -> 2011.88s]  Oh, I thought that was like a poem.
[2014.46s -> 2014.78s]  Is it?
[2037.18s -> 2039.02s]  Harley, how did you get access to the PA system?
[2049.10s -> 2055.77s]  She's just on the PA?
[2055.77s -> 2056.01s]  Okay.
[2056.01s -> 2056.41s]  There we go.
[2059.13s -> 2071.24s]  Scan the card catalog.
[2071.24s -> 2073.96s]  Index locations of all documents stored in the records room.
[2073.96s -> 2079.66s]  Okay.
[2079.66s -> 2080.22s]  Look at the...
[2080.78s -> 2082.09s]  Up here.
[2082.09s -> 2088.38s]  Over there.
[2088.38s -> 2092.41s]  Can I open that?
[2092.41s -> 2092.91s]  Analyze.
[2093.76s -> 2094.72s]  Bingo.
[2094.72s -> 2096.24s]  Here's what Harley was looking for.
[2097.39s -> 2098.83s]  Here's your documents, Harley.
[2099.23s -> 2103.07s]  I think I found out all I can about this case.
[2103.63s -> 2105.71s]  I wonder what Harley will have to say about it.
[2106.43s -> 2107.68s]  I'm going to open the door.
[2107.68s -> 2109.60s]  Potentially this is tied to what Batman was after.
[2110.32s -> 2111.80s]  This is a boss.
[2111.80s -> 2112.92s]  This has to be a boss fight, right?
[2112.92s -> 2114.36s]  I'm going to be fighting Harley Quinn.
[2114.36s -> 2130.00s]  How does Harley want from this file?
[2130.56s -> 2134.20s]  Mine is a maze, but it's still amazing.
[2134.76s -> 2135.96s]  She must have a good reason.
[2136.60s -> 2137.40s]  She's going to open the door.
[2137.40s -> 2138.20s]  She's going to take it from me.
[2138.20s -> 2139.56s]  And she's going to go like...
[2140.20s -> 2141.88s]  I can't do a Harley Quinn impression,
[2141.88s -> 2143.08s]  but it's going to be something like...
[2144.65s -> 2144.97s]  Oh!
[2145.61s -> 2147.05s]  I can't do a Harley Quinn impression.
[2148.01s -> 2158.12s]  Good job, everyone.
[2158.12s -> 2159.32s]  You made things even worse.
[2159.32s -> 2161.88s]  It doesn't belong to you, dicks!
[2161.88s -> 2162.84s]  What are they even fighting?
[2166.86s -> 2167.18s]  All right.
[2168.84s -> 2171.96s]  Is this getting his head bashed in with a bat?
[2173.08s -> 2174.28s]  Look at how many times...
[2174.28s -> 2175.40s]  This is awful!
[2178.68s -> 2179.64s]  Oh my God!
[2186.27s -> 2187.68s]  Oh, shit!
[2187.68s -> 2188.80s]  That person's a psycho.
[2195.80s -> 2196.76s]  I'm coming.
[2196.76s -> 2197.26s]  Relax.
[2197.88s -> 2199.00s]  Where else do you need to be?
[2200.88s -> 2201.52s]  Do something?
[2202.16s -> 2203.20s]  What do you mean, do something?
[2203.92s -> 2207.68s]  I'm not supposed to protect every single citizen
[2207.68s -> 2208.72s]  as the title of the stream.
[2209.44s -> 2212.97s]  Never mind.
[2245.32s -> 2248.04s]  Why are they all fighting each other?
[2248.84s -> 2253.52s]  All right.
[2253.52s -> 2260.48s]  This guy is throwing lit toilet paper out the fucking window.
[2265.64s -> 2267.56s]  You guys are going to be real pissed off
[2267.56s -> 2271.88s]  once somebody in this prison has to take a shit.
[2275.80s -> 2278.44s]  Larry, did you have to throw 200 rolls of toilet paper?
[2278.44s -> 2280.04s]  You can just throw in one or two.
[2282.64s -> 2283.36s]  They're all doing it.
[2307.55s -> 2308.35s]  Please talk more.
[2348.24s -> 2349.44s]  I do these movements.
[2349.44s -> 2350.40s]  I do this like in the kitchen.
[2355.20s -> 2356.00s]  Is the pizza here?
[2365.74s -> 2366.24s]  What?
[2376.97s -> 2377.77s]  Go, go, go!
[2377.77s -> 2378.65s]  Chase the balloon, quick!
[2379.45s -> 2384.03s]  Where did it go?
[2385.56s -> 2386.20s]  Where's the balloon?
[2394.28s -> 2396.60s]  That guy has two shattered ankles.
[2402.97s -> 2404.01s]  Oh, shit!
[2404.01s -> 2404.65s]  It's mayhem!
[2406.89s -> 2408.01s]  Where's the music coming from?
[2412.96s -> 2413.84s]  What am I doing?
[2421.84s -> 2422.96s]  To beat the riot?
[2423.60s -> 2430.62s]  To shoot the balloon down?
[2431.34s -> 2444.08s]  I don't even know who I'm attacking.
[2444.08s -> 2445.52s]  I'm just fighting random people.
[2455.31s -> 2456.91s]  What the fuck was that?
[2456.91s -> 2457.41s]  Hey!
[2457.95s -> 2468.16s]  All right, I have to do that, though.
[2468.16s -> 2469.40s]  I have to do that.
[2469.40s -> 2470.52s]  I actually have to fight them.
[2475.05s -> 2476.09s]  I'm just going to stay back.
[2476.81s -> 2497.34s]  Who's throwing the lit toilet paper?
[2497.34s -> 2499.02s]  Because you're dead first.
[2499.66s -> 2500.06s]  It's you.
[2500.06s -> 2500.38s]  Get...
[2500.38s -> 2500.88s]  Okay.
[2502.20s -> 2503.24s]  Just kill this guy.
[2507.23s -> 2507.87s]  Hit him.
[2507.87s -> 2508.83s]  Hit him.
[2508.83s -> 2509.71s]  Somebody hit this guy.
[2510.92s -> 2511.80s]  This guy right here.
[2512.76s -> 2516.49s]  Stop.
[2516.49s -> 2529.53s]  Get him.
[2529.53s -> 2529.93s]  Grab him!
[2532.86s -> 2533.98s]  All right.
[2533.98s -> 2534.38s]  Let's just be...
[2534.38s -> 2535.42s]  Hey, buddy, buddy, buddy.
[2535.42s -> 2535.90s]  Listen to me.
[2536.46s -> 2537.66s]  You and I are going to pretend to be fighting
[2537.66s -> 2538.94s]  so people don't come and fucking fight us.
[2538.94s -> 2540.38s]  But we're going to get out of this alive together.
[2540.38s -> 2541.18s]  Just...
[2541.18s -> 2541.74s]  Oh, fuck!
[2541.74s -> 2542.94s]  Dude, I got somebody.
[2542.94s -> 2543.58s]  Just pretend to be fighting.
[2543.58s -> 2544.62s]  No one's going to fight both of us.
[2545.42s -> 2546.62s]  Watch out.
[2546.62s -> 2547.02s]  Watch out!
[2547.50s -> 2548.62s]  Oh, you piece of shit.
[2549.96s -> 2550.20s]  Over here.
[2550.20s -> 2550.92s]  Go over that way.
[2550.92s -> 2551.32s]  That way.
[2551.32s -> 2551.64s]  Over there.
[2552.36s -> 2556.14s]  Oh, shit.
[2556.14s -> 2556.62s]  I'm sorry.
[2557.34s -> 2565.48s]  What is the song?
[2569.87s -> 2570.43s]  No!
[2570.43s -> 2570.99s]  You killed...
[2576.04s -> 2576.84s]  I didn't even see...
[2577.40s -> 2578.04s]  All right.
[2578.04s -> 2579.40s]  I'm going in hard now.
[2579.40s -> 2580.04s]  I'm going in hard.
[2580.04s -> 2581.56s]  I'm killing everybody in here.
[2581.56s -> 2582.44s]  No more messing around.
[2583.58s -> 2584.94s]  I got hit directly.
[2584.94s -> 2585.66s]  All right.
[2585.66s -> 2586.70s]  I'm going for it this time.
[2588.48s -> 2590.16s]  It's Livin' Lovita Loca.
[2591.42s -> 2591.82s]  All right.
[2591.82s -> 2592.06s]  Take...
[2592.86s -> 2601.10s]  Ow!
[2601.90s -> 2607.76s]  All right.
[2607.76s -> 2608.08s]  Goodbye.
[2608.56s -> 2624.91s]  Oh, shit.
[2638.24s -> 2639.44s]  This is fucking crazy.
[2640.32s -> 2643.47s]  That guy's just taunting me.
[2644.51s -> 2645.39s]  Now, fuck you, man.
[2645.39s -> 2646.19s]  Get out of the server.
[2647.07s -> 2648.03s]  Let somebody else play.
[2648.99s -> 2651.39s]  There's three people trying to queue up to this place.
[2651.39s -> 2651.79s]  And you're...
[2651.79s -> 2652.11s]  Come on.
[2653.07s -> 2659.36s]  You thought you were going to hit me, didn't you?
[2660.16s -> 2669.53s]  I guess this guy's on fire.
[2670.25s -> 2679.63s]  I completely missed you.
[2680.51s -> 2684.49s]  Dude, are you seriously sitting there calling me a vigilante right now?
[2696.76s -> 2705.28s]  Don't...
[2705.28s -> 2713.10s]  I'm going to have to fight two huge people.
[2719.34s -> 2720.22s]  Nice teamwork.
[2720.22s -> 2720.70s]  You and me.
[2720.70s -> 2721.02s]  You and me.
[2721.02s -> 2721.42s]  You and me.
[2740.30s -> 2740.70s]  Uh-oh.
[2740.70s -> 2741.58s]  There's only two left.
[2742.54s -> 2743.90s]  Don't kill me, please.
[2751.13s -> 2751.61s]  Shit.
[2753.13s -> 2754.33s]  Oh, god damn it.
[2754.97s -> 2755.69s]  Oh, my god.
[2755.69s -> 2758.01s]  I got fucking whirlwinded.
[2761.39s -> 2762.03s]  Shit.
[2762.03s -> 2763.71s]  Oh, I'm actually fucking pissed.
[2763.71s -> 2765.07s]  I'm going to turn it down to medium.
[2765.07s -> 2766.03s]  I'm going to turn it down to medium.
[2766.03s -> 2766.99s]  I'm turning it down to medium.
[2766.99s -> 2767.31s]  I'm sorry.
[2767.31s -> 2768.91s]  I'm turning it to medium.
[2768.91s -> 2769.71s]  It's way too hard for me.
[2777.61s -> 2778.41s]  Just for this part.
[2778.41s -> 2779.29s]  Just for this part.
[2779.29s -> 2779.53s]  My...
[2779.53s -> 2779.93s]  I don't have...
[2779.93s -> 2780.49s]  I didn't have any...
[2780.49s -> 2781.21s]  I didn't find any good...
[2781.21s -> 2782.09s]  I have to craft gear.
[2783.13s -> 2788.48s]  I was playing with Nightwing the whole game.
[2789.28s -> 2790.08s]  I don't have any...
[2790.08s -> 2791.84s]  I don't have any items for fucking Red Hood.
[2809.66s -> 2810.06s]  Unload.
[2812.80s -> 2813.60s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[2813.60s -> 2814.32s]  That was perfect.
[2819.34s -> 2819.74s]  Perfect.
[2820.38s -> 2830.01s]  All right.
[2830.01s -> 2831.45s]  We're fighting two different fights.
[2832.01s -> 2833.21s]  Just crossing into each other.
[2834.57s -> 2835.37s]  Why did that guy fall?
[2836.41s -> 2843.88s]  Don't you dare kill me on medium.
[2844.44s -> 2857.64s]  No!
[2857.64s -> 2857.88s]  No!
[2858.92s -> 2864.01s]  You are so much more powerful than me.
[2864.01s -> 2865.21s]  It's not fair.
[2865.21s -> 2865.37s]  You...
[2873.34s -> 2873.66s]  Okay.
[2873.66s -> 2877.02s]  Well, per the rules of the superhero agreements,
[2877.10s -> 2878.94s]  you are now part of the Gotham Knights.
[2879.87s -> 2880.75s]  Congratulations.
[2881.47s -> 2882.59s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[2882.59s -> 2885.12s]  That was so fucking funny.
[2885.12s -> 2885.92s]  Dude, you suck.
[2885.92s -> 2886.32s]  I'm...
[2886.32s -> 2887.76s]  I'm doing fine.
[2887.76s -> 2889.12s]  I'm doing just fine.
[2894.97s -> 2895.29s]  All right.
[2895.29s -> 2895.45s]  Get...
[2898.60s -> 2898.92s]  Look at...
[2898.92s -> 2900.20s]  She's destroying people.
[2900.76s -> 2901.48s]  I'm just staying back.
[2911.13s -> 2912.17s]  You fucking idiot.
[2912.17s -> 2913.13s]  Why would you...
[2913.13s -> 2913.69s]  Get him.
[2913.69s -> 2914.49s]  Kill him, not me.
[2914.49s -> 2915.29s]  Why would you do that?
[2915.93s -> 2927.71s]  I'll be back later.
[2927.71s -> 2928.35s]  I'll be back...
[2938.59s -> 2938.99s]  Don't!
[2951.29s -> 2953.07s]  Dude, I feel like I'm...
[2953.07s -> 2954.91s]  I feel like this opening was like a Royal Rumble.
[2971.04s -> 2972.40s]  No, not on the rematch.
[2978.25s -> 2978.57s]  No!
[2979.21s -> 2985.12s]  Please die!
[2985.12s -> 2986.24s]  Thank God.
[2986.24s -> 2986.80s]  Thank God.
[2986.80s -> 2987.28s]  Thank God.
[2987.28s -> 2987.52s]  All right.
[2987.52s -> 2987.76s]  We go.
[2987.76s -> 2988.08s]  We go.
[2988.08s -> 2988.32s]  We go.
[2988.32s -> 2988.48s]  We go.
[2988.48s -> 2989.52s]  We go.
[2989.52s -> 2999.29s]  Ow.
[3007.13s -> 3008.09s]  All right.
[3008.09s -> 3008.57s]  Let's go.
[3013.02s -> 3013.34s]  Swing.
[3014.54s -> 3015.50s]  Swing at me.
[3015.50s -> 3016.06s]  Swing at me.
[3018.19s -> 3018.67s]  Dumbass.
[3019.55s -> 3023.69s]  What's going on?
[3023.69s -> 3024.25s]  I had to reload.
[3024.97s -> 3032.88s]  I mean, don't have fun without me.
[3033.52s -> 3038.96s]  Watch out.
[3038.96s -> 3039.36s]  Watch out.
[3039.36s -> 3039.68s]  Big...
[3039.68s -> 3040.48s]  Big guy coming in.
[3064.08s -> 3064.40s]  Die!
[3072.32s -> 3072.88s]  Okay.
[3072.88s -> 3084.11s]  I did it.
[3084.11s -> 3084.35s]  Wait.
[3084.35s -> 3085.55s]  The room is...
[3085.55s -> 3089.31s]  The camera is glitching and showing like other parts of my room.
[3089.31s -> 3090.43s]  That's fucking hilarious.
[3096.52s -> 3101.05s]  What the fuck is going on with my camera?
[3101.05s -> 3108.00s]  It's like putting my chin down here like this.
[3108.00s -> 3110.08s]  Dude, we can see your...
[3110.08s -> 3124.00s]  No, you can't.
[3124.00s -> 3124.24s]  Okay.
[3124.24s -> 3134.67s]  We're good.
[3134.67s -> 3135.87s]  What is it?
[3135.87s -> 3136.43s]  Oh, it's...
[3136.43s -> 3136.83s]  Okay.
[3136.83s -> 3137.55s]  I see what it's doing.
[3137.55s -> 3138.35s]  That's fucking funny.
[3148.41s -> 3148.73s]  All right.
[3148.73s -> 3149.61s]  Let me go pee.
[3149.61s -> 3150.33s]  Let me pee first.
[3150.33s -> 3153.42s]  I'll be right back.
[3153.42s -> 3427.00s]  I haven't peed.
[3427.00s -> 3427.50s]  Okay.
[3439.98s -> 3441.34s]  That was fucking funny.
[3441.34s -> 3441.98s]  That was fun.
[3443.15s -> 3448.24s]  I'd be lying to you if I didn't think that was an incredibly enjoyable experience.
[3448.24s -> 3448.48s]  All right.
[3448.48s -> 3452.86s]  So what is going on with my webcam?
[3452.86s -> 3453.66s]  Like, honest to God.
[3453.66s -> 3457.44s]  Why is it freaking out?
[3457.44s -> 3458.56s]  Why is it freaking out?
[3458.56s -> 3463.23s]  It doesn't make any sense.
[3463.23s -> 3464.19s]  Help us.
[3464.19s -> 3471.98s]  Yeah, it seems to only happen with...
[3471.98s -> 3472.54s]  I don't know what...
[3472.54s -> 3476.11s]  It's something to do with how it's pulling in through OBS.
[3476.11s -> 3483.13s]  I don't know.
[3483.13s -> 3484.17s]  Should I plug it back in?
[3484.73s -> 3489.52s]  I don't know.
[3489.52s -> 3490.80s]  Was this happening yesterday?
[3490.80s -> 3492.76s]  I don't remember this happening yesterday.
[3506.32s -> 3509.92s]  I remember it was glitching yesterday, but it was like teleporting around the room.
[3510.56s -> 3525.18s]  I bet you can't even remember what you were eating yesterday.
[3525.98s -> 3526.78s]  I do.
[3526.78s -> 3527.26s]  I remember.
[3533.39s -> 3536.43s]  What the hell am I supposed to do with this, Harley?
[3536.43s -> 3542.72s]  Crime weapon.
[3543.36s -> 3547.32s]  The camera's having an out-of-body experience.
[3566.80s -> 3568.16s]  Well, I'm sorry that's happening.
[3568.80s -> 3572.62s]  It really shouldn't be.
[3572.62s -> 3574.62s]  But I'm going to turn it back on.
[3574.62s -> 3584.83s]  We still freaking out?
[3611.24s -> 3614.19s]  All right.
[3614.19s -> 3614.67s]  That was fun.
[3615.23s -> 3617.07s]  Let's keep moving.
[3617.71s -> 3620.91s]  Fix your hair.
[3624.64s -> 3625.12s]  I just did.
[3625.68s -> 3629.04s]  All right.
[3629.04s -> 3629.60s]  So I get my...
[3630.40s -> 3631.20s]  I get my shit back.
[3631.76s -> 3635.79s]  Change it back to hard?
[3635.79s -> 3636.03s]  No.
[3650.52s -> 3650.84s]  All right.
[3653.05s -> 3654.25s]  I'm just going to teleport back.
[3654.81s -> 3657.00s]  That was a wild mission.
[3657.56s -> 3662.62s]  I'm going to...
[3662.62s -> 3663.74s]  Yeah, I'll keep it on medium.
[3663.74s -> 3674.04s]  This is the AI reconstruction of your room.
[3674.04s -> 3682.62s]  Why is there like another person?
[3682.62s -> 3691.37s]  There's another person here.
[3691.37s -> 3692.09s]  Hold on.
[3692.09s -> 3696.88s]  I want to see what this looks like.
[3696.88s -> 3717.44s]  Let's see.
[3717.44s -> 3725.28s]  So this is an AI of the room?
[3726.81s -> 3729.53s]  AI recreated the room.
[3729.53s -> 3730.25s]  Why is it...
[3731.23s -> 3732.35s]  What's the opacity for?
[3732.35s -> 3744.20s]  Oh, right.
[3744.20s -> 3748.49s]  This looks like you took this picture in a submarine.
[3748.49s -> 3753.16s]  Like this is my submarine streamer room.
[3753.16s -> 3763.20s]  Yeah, why is there another person over here?
[3763.20s -> 3771.07s]  What is that?
[3771.07s -> 3773.90s]  I don't know.
[3773.90s -> 3774.22s]  All right.
[3774.22s -> 3777.68s]  Well, interesting.
[3777.68s -> 3780.32s]  I think maybe it thinks that's a mirror.
[3780.32s -> 3802.41s]  I imagine that's probably what it thinks.
[3802.41s -> 3804.14s]  It's evil.
[3804.14s -> 3804.70s]  I don't know.
[3804.70s -> 3805.74s]  I have no idea, man.
[3805.74s -> 3816.83s]  I think my OBS is crashing.
[3816.83s -> 3820.64s]  What happened to my thing?
[3820.64s -> 3831.58s]  Oh, there it is.
[3831.58s -> 3833.42s]  I mean, I could just like unplug the webcam
[3833.42s -> 3835.45s]  and go without cam for a little while.
[3835.45s -> 3837.37s]  If it's that annoying.
[3839.45s -> 3840.54s]  Whatever.
[3840.54s -> 3845.64s]  One crime stopped today.
[3845.64s -> 3849.21s]  Not zero.
[3849.21s -> 3849.77s]  At least one.
[3849.77s -> 3855.24s]  We updated the board.
[3855.24s -> 3855.48s]  All right.
[3855.48s -> 3856.04s]  Talk to Alfred.
[3864.03s -> 3866.91s]  Thinking about what happened at Blackgate, Master Jason?
[3867.71s -> 3869.95s]  I can't believe Harley got away.
[3869.95s -> 3871.15s]  She played us.
[3871.15s -> 3873.23s]  And I'm sure she's got more shit planned.
[3873.87s -> 3876.83s]  She hasn't left any other messages or maps.
[3876.83s -> 3879.71s]  Do you have any leads on where she might have gone?
[3879.71s -> 3880.27s]  Not really.
[3880.83s -> 3883.31s]  But the freaks are usually your partners in crime.
[3884.03s -> 3885.63s]  A good place to stop, then.
[3886.59s -> 3895.18s]  OK, unloading clues.
[3897.02s -> 3898.54s]  Open the book and examine the evidence.
[3898.54s -> 3899.10s]  Is it up here?
[3899.90s -> 3900.62s]  There it is.
[3900.62s -> 3901.18s]  Let's take a look.
[3905.92s -> 3909.92s]  Harley's profiled some seriously anti-social prisoners here.
[3910.72s -> 3913.92s]  Look, something's going on at Blackgate.
[3913.92s -> 3915.52s]  We lean on that warden.
[3915.52s -> 3916.08s]  We're set.
[3916.96s -> 3919.98s]  These records go back centuries, man.
[3919.98s -> 3921.02s]  The warden's new.
[3921.90s -> 3922.86s]  I doubt she's involved.
[3923.66s -> 3927.88s]  How did I miss this?
[3929.05s -> 3930.01s]  All right.
[3930.01s -> 3932.48s]  Harley's stupid system makes no sense.
[3933.92s -> 3943.58s]  Hey, Babs, what did you figure out?
[3945.18s -> 3947.90s]  They all got out on appeal.
[3947.90s -> 3949.42s]  That's what Harley was tracking.
[3950.30s -> 3953.82s]  In every case, key witnesses were murdered.
[3953.82s -> 3959.42s]  Look, they were all pinned up with knives, just like Langstrom.
[3959.98s -> 3962.25s]  Bruce is onto something.
[3963.05s -> 3963.55s]  Oh?
[3964.25s -> 3966.06s]  I think I've got something.
[3966.62s -> 3970.96s]  Oswald Coppelpot, the Penguin.
[3971.76s -> 3973.04s]  He's like everyone else in here.
[3974.41s -> 3978.73s]  Except he served his sentence every single time he was arrested.
[3979.61s -> 3981.29s]  Someone must have hung him out to dry.
[3982.01s -> 3983.21s]  Might be he's willing to talk.
[3983.85s -> 3985.84s]  He runs the Iceberg Lounge now.
[3986.40s -> 3987.28s]  Claims he went legit.
[3988.16s -> 3990.48s]  He definitely runs more than liquor through that bar.
[3991.28s -> 3992.40s]  I wouldn't know.
[3992.40s -> 3993.44s]  That man would never take me.
[3994.56s -> 3998.00s]  If you wanted a fake ID, Tim, all you had to do was ask.
[4000.80s -> 4001.76s]  Oswald's dangerous.
[4002.40s -> 4004.84s]  And we can't forget, Harley's still out there.
[4005.72s -> 4007.62s]  Careful.
[4012.41s -> 4014.57s]  Relax, dick.
[4015.61s -> 4017.93s]  We got this.
[4018.89s -> 4024.36s]  So we're going after the Penguin?
[4025.16s -> 4025.66s]  All right.
[4034.91s -> 4036.91s]  Reach the Iceberg Lounge.
[4036.91s -> 4037.41s]  We got it.
[4037.87s -> 4040.56s]  Let me see what we got.
[4041.12s -> 4043.28s]  Should I do some more of just like crime fighting?
[4043.28s -> 4043.92s]  I feel like I should.
[4044.56s -> 4048.51s]  Secret identity compromised.
[4048.51s -> 4052.67s]  Protecting Batman's secret identity is vital to protecting Bruce Wayne's legacy.
[4052.75s -> 4057.56s]  Reach a specified location and plant fake information, giving Bruce Wayne an alibi.
[4057.56s -> 4060.28s]  If you're caught, you won't be able to plant the fake info again.
[4060.28s -> 4061.40s]  Until the next night.
[4063.66s -> 4064.30s]  Really?
[4064.30s -> 4065.02s]  Okay.
[4065.02s -> 4072.59s]  I'm getting overexposed here too.
[4072.59s -> 4074.49s]  Go like this.
[4074.49s -> 4079.66s]  I need to at least do like one or two.
[4079.66s -> 4080.70s]  I have to do at least a couple.
[4082.27s -> 4085.00s]  Like crime stopping things.
[4097.32s -> 4098.36s]  Drop the gamma on this.
[4099.77s -> 4101.45s]  It's a little too overexposed.
[4109.13s -> 4111.42s]  That's better.
[4111.42s -> 4112.14s]  That's better.
[4118.52s -> 4119.80s]  Okay, reach Iceberg Lounge.
[4119.80s -> 4120.36s]  What else is there?
[4121.32s -> 4129.58s]  Only one of Gotham's rich and powerful has served actual prison time.
[4129.58s -> 4132.38s]  Oswald Cobblepot, aka the Penguin.
[4132.38s -> 4133.10s]  Aim of visit.
[4133.74s -> 4136.89s]  I think I have a point to put in.
[4136.89s -> 4137.39s]  I do.
[4137.85s -> 4141.92s]  Crit damage 20%.
[4142.80s -> 4151.34s]  What's the second thing on the third tier here?
[4152.88s -> 4156.72s]  Every round Red Hood shoots has a small chance to deal five times the damage.
[4157.28s -> 4159.60s]  Only applies to ranged attacks and precision aim.
[4159.60s -> 4160.10s]  Okay.
[4162.32s -> 4162.80s]  I need...
[4162.80s -> 4163.44s]  I'm not gonna do anything.
[4163.44s -> 4164.00s]  I need two points.
[4164.72s -> 4177.56s]  Again, this is a sponsored segment of the stream.
[4177.56s -> 4179.48s]  This is sponsored by Wanda Brothers.
[4180.20s -> 4185.47s]  Gotham Knights is currently available right now on Xbox Series S,
[4185.47s -> 4191.39s]  Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PC, which I'm playing on right now with a 3090.
[4192.11s -> 4193.66s]  It's an open world game.
[4194.54s -> 4199.02s]  You can play as four different characters in the Batman universe.
[4199.66s -> 4202.17s]  Currently playing as Red Hood.
[4202.73s -> 4203.93s]  There is full co-op.
[4204.73s -> 4207.93s]  Pretty cool.
[4207.93s -> 4218.01s]  Make the webcam bigger.
[4218.01s -> 4218.49s]  I don't know.
[4218.49s -> 4219.05s]  It's too small.
[4224.30s -> 4234.68s]  Better take a different way in like Batman would.
[4236.59s -> 4237.15s]  Go up in the roof.
[4237.71s -> 4244.94s]  Let me take a look.
[4244.94s -> 4245.42s]  Hold on.
[4245.42s -> 4246.62s]  Let me see what it looks like.
[4247.34s -> 4254.24s]  Okay, cool.
[4254.24s -> 4255.60s]  Let's go beat up the penguin.
[4255.60s -> 4257.60s]  Let's punch him in the face a million times.
[4258.24s -> 4264.80s]  Wait, co-op is actually kind of nice.
[4264.80s -> 4266.08s]  There's like three co-op games.
[4267.71s -> 4268.59s]  Yeah, that'd be the whole...
[4268.59s -> 4270.59s]  I think the whole purpose of the game is to do...
[4270.59s -> 4274.11s]  To have just to jump in with a friend and just run around and solve crimes and stuff.
[4276.83s -> 4277.71s]  Yeah, it's all co-op.
[4280.01s -> 4280.41s]  All right.
[4280.41s -> 4281.37s]  Talk to the penguin.
[4282.01s -> 4284.64s]  The tax manual.
[4285.37s -> 4285.87s]  Yeah.
[4286.09s -> 4287.61s]  Like this guy pays taxes.
[4288.25s -> 4292.76s]  The coin with his name on it.
[4293.32s -> 4294.68s]  This guy is something else.
[4297.21s -> 4297.93s]  Is he just in here?
[4298.73s -> 4302.20s]  Is this like the penguin's club?
[4315.63s -> 4316.99s]  Something's definitely shut up.
[4324.48s -> 4325.20s]  What?
[4325.20s -> 4329.29s]  Was that quiet?
[4330.01s -> 4330.33s]  All right.
[4330.33s -> 4331.37s]  That was silent apparently.
[4332.01s -> 4335.64s]  You were at where club...
[4336.84s -> 4342.83s]  All right.
[4342.83s -> 4344.43s]  I just got one more guard.
[4344.99s -> 4345.23s]  All right.
[4345.23s -> 4345.63s]  Go down.
[4361.76s -> 4362.08s]  Whoops!
[4362.80s -> 4370.52s]  I pressed the wrong button.
[4371.32s -> 4378.52s]  I pressed the wrong button.
[4384.12s -> 4384.76s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4384.76s -> 4385.24s]  Don't follow me.
[4397.88s -> 4398.68s]  You psycho!
[4403.66s -> 4403.98s]  All right.
[4403.98s -> 4404.38s]  Just get...
[4405.42s -> 4406.46s]  I can do that too, you know.
[4407.42s -> 4411.60s]  I need to do a silent takedown.
[4411.60s -> 4412.72s]  I got to drop aggro.
[4413.36s -> 4432.20s]  I got to drop aggro.
[4432.20s -> 4433.00s]  I got to drop aggro.
[4433.00s -> 4433.72s]  I want to get the bonus.
[4436.64s -> 4437.44s]  No, who cares?
[4437.44s -> 4438.16s]  I'm going to just get you.
[4439.36s -> 4442.19s]  How did you do that?
[4459.37s -> 4459.87s]  Ooh.
[4462.01s -> 4466.54s]  That's a broken face.
[4467.34s -> 4470.70s]  All right.
[4470.70s -> 4471.58s]  Where's the penguin's office?
[4477.50s -> 4478.86s]  Can I grapple anything?
[4478.86s -> 4479.36s]  Yeah.
[4486.00s -> 4487.08s]  It's locked.
[4487.08s -> 4487.88s]  Really?
[4487.88s -> 4492.36s]  That door's sandalwood.
[4492.36s -> 4493.08s]  Custom job.
[4493.88s -> 4496.19s]  Fixing it's going to be a pain in the ass.
[4496.19s -> 4496.51s]  Yeah.
[4496.51s -> 4499.15s]  Just answer my questions and I won't break anything else.
[4499.87s -> 4500.43s]  Smile.
[4501.87s -> 4506.99s]  Viral video of you assaulting Reformed Citizen is the last thing you need right now.
[4508.49s -> 4509.29s]  Reformed?
[4513.40s -> 4515.64s]  Guess all that time in Blackgate did the trick.
[4516.28s -> 4521.04s]  Funny how you weren't able to weasel out of it like so many of your pals.
[4521.04s -> 4523.36s]  That is actually cool that everybody has their own dialogue
[4523.36s -> 4525.12s]  because they have to record four different sessions.
[4525.12s -> 4525.92s]  Someone's done their homework.
[4525.92s -> 4526.56s]  That's cool.
[4526.56s -> 4529.44s]  I want to know who's handing out get out of jail cards.
[4536.09s -> 4538.17s]  If you really want to go down this rabbit hole,
[4538.17s -> 4541.93s]  you need to know there's no coming back from it.
[4541.93s -> 4543.29s]  Never stop me before.
[4543.29s -> 4546.33s]  Penguin, which Gotham bad guy do you think you are?
[4546.33s -> 4548.01s]  I'm going to spell this out for you.
[4548.01s -> 4549.45s]  Well, I think I'm the Joker.
[4549.45s -> 4551.10s]  With the bad guy.
[4551.10s -> 4551.66s]  Say it.
[4551.66s -> 4554.89s]  You're not worth it.
[4554.89s -> 4555.45s]  Get lost.
[4565.21s -> 4566.33s]  Because I'm the Riddler.
[4566.33s -> 4567.29s]  That's who I think I am.
[4568.65s -> 4576.12s]  Well, I can't just like grab him and like smash, smash, smash his head against the desk.
[4588.24s -> 4588.80s]  Oh, chess.
[4589.44s -> 4592.92s]  Oh, wait, maybe he does think he's the Riddler.
[4601.69s -> 4606.40s]  Guns.
[4606.40s -> 4607.44s]  Wait, what is this painting?
[4617.98s -> 4635.52s]  Okay.
[4635.52s -> 4637.76s]  Well, that's cool that we get to actually meet Penguin there.
[4638.40s -> 4640.40s]  I don't get to punch him in the face.
[4641.04s -> 4646.06s]  Is Penguin that old?
[4646.06s -> 4652.14s]  I mean, I think Bruce Wayne looked a little older in this.
[4652.14s -> 4653.50s]  He looked like he was like older.
[4653.50s -> 4656.38s]  So I think this is takes place kind of maybe a little bit later.
[4656.38s -> 4671.47s]  He uh, well, all right, turn to the bell.
[4672.67s -> 4673.39s]  Belfry.
[4673.39s -> 4674.99s]  Penguin was a dead end.
[4674.99s -> 4676.83s]  Whatever he knows, he's not telling.
[4677.55s -> 4680.86s]  I had to come back to the Belfry and we'll regroup.
[4680.86s -> 4682.96s]  Sounds good.
[4682.96s -> 4684.09s]  Thanks.
[4684.09s -> 4686.65s]  No, no, I'm not doing that.
[4687.21s -> 4688.57s]  I'm going to stop some crimes.
[4688.57s -> 4690.89s]  I'm not going to be zero crime prevented Andy.
[4692.84s -> 4693.96s]  We're stopping some crimes.
[4695.74s -> 4697.82s]  Otherwise, am I even a superhero at this point?
[4697.82s -> 4701.18s]  Like I need to protect the like the community and stuff.
[4701.18s -> 4702.70s]  So I'm going to let's go.
[4706.17s -> 4707.61s]  This one's right here.
[4708.17s -> 4710.09s]  There's some people stealing shit over here.
[4710.97s -> 4728.91s]  Okay, let's do it.
[4729.63s -> 4734.59s]  What's up?
[4741.15s -> 4741.47s]  Look at this.
[4741.47s -> 4742.35s]  What's this huge guy?
[4742.99s -> 4744.43s]  He's got like a jet pack on.
[4761.96s -> 4762.84s]  What the fuck?
[4764.32s -> 4765.12s]  Holy okay.
[4765.76s -> 4776.22s]  Electricity guy.
[4784.44s -> 4793.79s]  No, I didn't get it off.
[4793.79s -> 4794.29s]  Shit.
[4794.75s -> 4812.58s]  Ow.
[4814.83s -> 4815.47s]  All right.
[4815.47s -> 4816.43s]  Crime stopped.
[4817.15s -> 4817.65s]  I did it.
[4818.27s -> 4820.24s]  I prevented the crime.
[4820.88s -> 4825.00s]  Let me do one more.
[4828.17s -> 4829.93s]  There is a big one going on over there.
[4830.65s -> 4832.84s]  I need one behind me.
[4832.84s -> 4836.40s]  There's a chest over there.
[4836.40s -> 4837.52s]  I need to do at least two.
[4838.24s -> 4843.96s]  Should I get the chest?
[4843.96s -> 4845.40s]  I want that chest.
[4845.40s -> 4845.90s]  I'm getting it.
[4846.44s -> 4851.52s]  Check your gear upgrades.
[4856.88s -> 4857.52s]  Holy shit.
[4858.16s -> 4859.60s]  44 defense.
[4859.60s -> 4880.89s]  This thing's pretty sick.
[4880.89s -> 4883.05s]  I wonder how many outfits there are for each character.
[4883.05s -> 4887.29s]  So that's this is I'm just gonna run up by a car.
[4887.93s -> 4891.61s]  You don't know if they don't recognize me
[4891.61s -> 4893.05s]  because I'm in a different costume.
[4893.05s -> 4894.01s]  It's me the red hood.
[4894.65s -> 4895.61s]  I'm trying a different look.
[4895.61s -> 4896.97s]  I'm trying a new outfit
[4896.97s -> 4898.01s]  and I think it looks pretty good.
[4899.12s -> 4903.04s]  It's equally scary but equally I've got authority
[4903.04s -> 4908.35s]  and I have you know you don't want to take a picture
[4908.35s -> 4909.71s]  for your Instagram or anything.
[4909.71s -> 4915.08s]  You would have taken a picture with the fucking Batman.
[4915.08s -> 4915.58s]  Wouldn't you?
[4916.20s -> 4933.31s]  All right, here we go straight ahead.
[4933.95s -> 4934.91s]  Crime in progress.
[4935.79s -> 4944.27s]  I'm on it.
[4949.68s -> 4950.18s]  Stop.
[4953.18s -> 4953.68s]  Stop.
[4954.78s -> 4955.58s]  Look what we have.
[4955.58s -> 4956.08s]  It's me.
[4967.95s -> 4969.23s]  I've reloaded and shot him.
[4969.87s -> 4972.93s]  I actually like this outfit.
[4973.49s -> 4978.11s]  All right.
[4978.11s -> 4978.98s]  Crime.
[4982.40s -> 4983.20s]  Crime stopped.
[4983.84s -> 4987.81s]  That counts, right?
[4988.45s -> 4999.38s]  Oh, there's another one right here.
[4999.94s -> 5002.00s]  Right down the street.
[5002.56s -> 5016.14s]  How did I just get in here?
[5016.70s -> 5020.82s]  Where am I?
[5020.82s -> 5021.94s]  I'm like in the sewers.
[5021.94s -> 5022.98s]  How did I get in here?
[5023.62s -> 5029.23s]  There's a loot box down here.
[5029.87s -> 5031.12s]  Yeah, there is.
[5031.12s -> 5031.92s]  I'll get it.
[5031.92s -> 5035.71s]  Is this a loot box?
[5036.43s -> 5038.13s]  What is this?
[5038.13s -> 5047.22s]  That was not a loot box.
[5047.22s -> 5048.66s]  Criminal activity.
[5048.66s -> 5049.54s]  I didn't do anything.
[5049.54s -> 5050.58s]  I didn't prevent any crimes.
[5052.82s -> 5053.94s]  I think they have to be the big ones.
[5060.69s -> 5062.69s]  All right, let's keep, we'll keep, we'll keep it rolling.
[5062.69s -> 5064.58s]  Let's keep it rolling.
[5064.58s -> 5071.89s]  All the AI images.
[5071.89s -> 5073.25s]  Yeah, they're looking fucking weird.
[5083.02s -> 5083.90s]  You didn't prevent anything.
[5083.90s -> 5088.51s]  You were just killing people.
[5088.51s -> 5089.23s]  All right, what do you got, Al?
[5091.33s -> 5092.61s]  Penguin kept his mouth shut.
[5093.25s -> 5095.01s]  Batman made this stuff look easy.
[5096.18s -> 5100.98s]  You may be surprised to learn Batman struggled with similar challenges early in his career.
[5101.86s -> 5105.70s]  So for a time, he focused his energies elsewhere in the city.
[5106.34s -> 5109.78s]  When word of his work got out, people were more inclined.
[5110.02s -> 5110.90s]  To cooperate.
[5112.34s -> 5112.90s]  The city.
[5113.70s -> 5117.46s]  We've been so wrapped up in Batman's last case, we ignored the rest of Gotham.
[5118.74s -> 5120.02s]  Gotham may not know Batman is gone.
[5120.02s -> 5123.30s]  I always feel like Red Hood is about to punch whoever he's talking to.
[5125.06s -> 5128.50s]  There has been a marked increase in gang-related crime.
[5129.78s -> 5134.10s]  Plus whatever shit Penguin's up to these days, maybe if we mess with him.
[5134.10s -> 5136.50s]  And if we look at crooks, they'll feel like talking.
[5137.46s -> 5142.74s]  You've also received messages from Lucius Fox and Detective Montoya.
[5142.74s -> 5143.94s]  They may be able to help.
[5145.30s -> 5146.10s]  Thanks, Alfred.
[5146.90s -> 5149.54s]  Guess it's time to take a page out of Batman's book.
[5150.82s -> 5153.30s]  I promise it's an excellent read.
[5153.86s -> 5154.18s]  Okay.
[5157.33s -> 5157.97s]  New email.
[5158.61s -> 5161.14s]  Oh my god, I'm not...
[5161.86s -> 5169.07s]  I mean, I haven't read any of these.
[5169.07s -> 5170.91s]  Batman sent me a fucking email?
[5171.55s -> 5172.27s]  What?
[5172.27s -> 5173.47s]  I got an email from Batman.
[5174.11s -> 5180.56s]  If you received this message, then people have started linking the words Bruce,
[5180.56s -> 5182.40s]  Wayne, and Batman online.
[5182.40s -> 5183.44s]  Which means my idea...
[5185.14s -> 5188.32s]  You think he knows that people are searching?
[5188.32s -> 5194.14s]  As you might understand, the Google Trends search is looking like Bruce,
[5194.14s -> 5195.42s]  Wayne, and Batman together.
[5196.22s -> 5199.10s]  I'm seeing a lot more of those in October of 2022.
[5206.27s -> 5209.07s]  Okay, so sorry I missed the email, Batman.
[5212.51s -> 5214.11s]  Our PR problem?
[5214.11s -> 5218.90s]  We have a reputation problem.
[5218.90s -> 5224.02s]  What with citizens of Gotham running at the very side of us and the GCPD hating our guts?
[5224.02s -> 5226.34s]  Mr. Dorius, my history teacher, used to say,
[5226.34s -> 5227.86s]  people fear what they don't understand.
[5227.86s -> 5229.94s]  I think I've come up with the perfect solution to our PR problem.
[5230.50s -> 5231.62s]  We start a podcast.
[5235.36s -> 5235.60s]  No.
[5238.13s -> 5240.13s]  Now, now, let's not be so quick to judge.
[5240.13s -> 5241.73s]  What exactly are you proposing, Tim?
[5242.37s -> 5246.26s]  I haven't gotten quite that far yet.
[5246.26s -> 5249.38s]  Maybe it's the four of us debunking myths about what we do
[5249.38s -> 5250.90s]  or debriefing our latest case.
[5250.90s -> 5252.34s]  We could answer listener questions.
[5252.90s -> 5255.68s]  We call it Podcast Nights or Bat Chat.
[5255.68s -> 5257.68s]  We can workshop the name, but I think it's a good idea.
[5258.56s -> 5261.84s]  We even already have fun interpersonal dynamics and banter,
[5261.84s -> 5263.95s]  which is the perfect for audio.
[5263.95s -> 5264.19s]  No.
[5264.75s -> 5266.54s]  See, we're already doing it.
[5266.54s -> 5270.70s]  Whenever you're being a party pooper, I'll just be like classic Red Hood.
[5270.70s -> 5272.54s]  If people will love it, we could do t-shirts.
[5287.38s -> 5288.42s]  I'm playing as Robin.
[5289.66s -> 5290.54s]  I'm going to play as Robin.
[5310.78s -> 5312.62s]  Realize I forgot to send flowers.
[5313.26s -> 5315.90s]  We're in the neighborhood.
[5315.90s -> 5317.02s]  Let's meet in my building.
[5318.05s -> 5319.49s]  I'd like to give you them impression.
[5323.90s -> 5325.98s]  Lucius Fox wants to give us flowers.
[5326.70s -> 5327.98s]  Does he know couriers exist?
[5329.39s -> 5333.95s]  Knowing Lucius, I suspect he has something far more useful for us.
[5333.95s -> 5334.27s]  Okay.
[5336.43s -> 5337.71s]  Head straight to the roof.
[5338.43s -> 5344.10s]  Check the evidence board.
[5344.98s -> 5345.78s]  Nightwing is fun.
[5345.78s -> 5346.58s]  Red Hood is fun, too.
[5347.68s -> 5347.92s]  Watch.
[5347.92s -> 5348.80s]  I'm going to play as Robin.
[5348.80s -> 5354.06s]  It's going to be my favorite character.
[5354.06s -> 5354.62s]  Okay.
[5354.62s -> 5356.59s]  I got some new stuff here.
[5357.15s -> 5360.86s]  Penguin's criminal deal.
[5362.51s -> 5364.51s]  Penguin's organ trafficking.
[5364.51s -> 5367.94s]  Lucius Fox.
[5367.94s -> 5369.46s]  Detective Montoya.
[5369.46s -> 5369.78s]  Okay.
[5370.34s -> 5373.52s]  There's a lot of stuff to do.
[5374.08s -> 5376.69s]  Harley returns.
[5377.41s -> 5379.74s]  Freaks have been teaming up with some unexpected allies.
[5379.74s -> 5381.42s]  Investigate their crimes to find out what's going on.
[5381.42s -> 5384.02s]  We got to do some interrogations.
[5392.37s -> 5392.61s]  Okay.
[5395.71s -> 5396.91s]  Time to patrol Gotham City.
[5396.91s -> 5397.23s]  I want...
[5397.23s -> 5398.67s]  What do I want to track?
[5398.67s -> 5400.34s]  What do you want?
[5400.34s -> 5400.98s]  What do I want to do?
[5401.70s -> 5402.34s]  Let's do...
[5405.78s -> 5406.42s]  What do you want to do?
[5406.98s -> 5407.78s]  Who should I go for?
[5407.78s -> 5408.42s]  Harley Quinn or...
[5410.06s -> 5419.04s]  Penguin.
[5419.04s -> 5419.68s]  Because there's...
[5423.42s -> 5424.30s]  Harley?
[5424.30s -> 5424.94s]  Penguin?
[5424.94s -> 5425.82s]  I'm seeing a lot of people say...
[5425.82s -> 5428.94s]  Let me just see who has a cooler potential plan here.
[5430.58s -> 5431.30s]  Yeah.
[5431.30s -> 5432.02s]  So let me see.
[5432.82s -> 5437.54s]  Stop a criminal deal to interfere with the Penguin's activities in Gotham City.
[5437.54s -> 5438.34s]  So that's like...
[5438.34s -> 5439.38s]  That's a Penguin marker.
[5440.96s -> 5441.84s]  Tracking an activity.
[5441.84s -> 5445.12s]  Stop an organ trafficking operation to interfere with the Penguin's activities.
[5445.12s -> 5446.88s]  All right.
[5446.88s -> 5447.68s]  Let's go do this.
[5447.68s -> 5450.08s]  Let's go stop some organ trafficking.
[5450.08s -> 5457.58s]  What's this?
[5457.58s -> 5463.81s]  I'm eating like a can of soup out of the can?
[5466.86s -> 5467.34s]  What?
[5467.42s -> 5470.75s]  I was just thinking of that time we all made dinner together,
[5470.75s -> 5473.79s]  and Tim got tomato sauce all over a bruised bass.
[5474.59s -> 5477.18s]  I don't remember that.
[5477.18s -> 5477.82s]  What?
[5477.82s -> 5478.38s]  You just eat it.
[5478.38s -> 5479.10s]  No, you have to.
[5479.10s -> 5479.90s]  It was the same year...
[5482.80s -> 5483.28s]  You know what?
[5484.16s -> 5484.72s]  Never mind.
[5485.84s -> 5486.88s]  Dumb story anyway.
[5487.60s -> 5490.08s]  Well, I could tell you a story.
[5490.88s -> 5492.16s]  It's about being dead,
[5493.04s -> 5495.92s]  then brought back to life by a pit of mind-altering goo.
[5497.25s -> 5498.93s]  Hey, I didn't mean...
[5498.93s -> 5499.97s]  I don't know what's worse.
[5500.85s -> 5503.01s]  Having a chunk of my life taken away from me
[5503.17s -> 5505.33s]  or coming back to everyone thinking I'm gonna snap.
[5506.21s -> 5512.21s]  I'm sorry, Jason.
[5512.77s -> 5513.90s]  We shouldn't have.
[5516.40s -> 5518.40s]  I shouldn't have treated you like an outsider.
[5519.04s -> 5529.70s]  My god, you're such a boy scout.
[5531.06s -> 5532.86s]  No wonder you were the first.
[5542.46s -> 5544.34s]  Dude, you gotta clean and peel that thing.
[5544.90s -> 5546.50s]  You gotta clean and peel that carrot.
[5554.24s -> 5554.74s]  Let's go.
[5566.16s -> 5567.36s]  Didn't peel the carrot.
[5567.36s -> 5568.48s]  Didn't peel the carrot.
[5572.75s -> 5574.98s]  All right, it's time...
[5575.70s -> 5577.49s]  Stop some crime.
[5581.90s -> 5582.94s]  What do I want to do?
[5584.62s -> 5585.34s]  This, right?
[5585.34s -> 5585.84s]  Okay.
[5586.22s -> 5589.02s]  Stop Penguin's criminal deal and to get his attention.
[5590.54s -> 5591.26s]  I'm doing this.
[5596.67s -> 5597.55s]  Let's get the Peng...
[5597.55s -> 5598.99s]  Let's mess with the Penguin.
[5607.02s -> 5607.52s]  Robin?
[5607.98s -> 5612.18s]  I'll switch to Robin in like 10 minutes.
[5633.49s -> 5633.99s]  That's me.
[5634.77s -> 5651.47s]  I don't even want to go this way.
[5652.03s -> 5656.13s]  Do I want to go this way?
[5659.47s -> 5660.75s]  Oh, because I have to go across the bridge.
[5660.75s -> 5661.47s]  Right, right, right, right.
[5669.10s -> 5669.60s]  Hey!
[5687.90s -> 5689.02s]  Oh, okay.
[5690.22s -> 5690.72s]  Got him.
[5693.98s -> 5694.78s]  Crime prevented.
[5702.06s -> 5703.02s]  You're welcome.
[5703.02s -> 5706.99s]  Stop murdering people.
[5708.67s -> 5709.55s]  What am I supposed to do?
[5709.55s -> 5710.05s]  Just run?
[5710.83s -> 5749.86s]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[5749.86s -> 5750.58s]  There we go.
[5751.38s -> 5751.88s]  One more.
[5761.39s -> 5762.67s]  All right, defeat all enemies,
[5762.67s -> 5764.19s]  retrieve the mod chips,
[5764.19s -> 5777.23s]  and do grab strikes.
[5777.23s -> 5777.87s]  10 enemies.
[5786.56s -> 5787.36s]  Wait, there's stuff over here.
[5788.08s -> 5803.42s]  Nice.
[5803.42s -> 5804.22s]  That's my favorite move.
[5806.85s -> 5807.35s]  What's up?
[5808.05s -> 5816.10s]  All right, I gotta interrogate somebody.
[5816.82s -> 5836.18s]  Nice try.
[5844.26s -> 5845.70s]  Don't kill the level five.
[5845.70s -> 5847.22s]  Oh my god, Jeremy.
[5868.59s -> 5869.09s]  Shit.
[5869.39s -> 5874.37s]  I think there's still a high level over here too.
[5878.69s -> 5879.19s]  Or...
[5890.43s -> 5892.13s]  I wanted to grab him.
[5899.06s -> 5904.60s]  Who's left?
[5915.18s -> 5915.90s]  Oh, you're here.
[5918.14s -> 5930.27s]  What do you know about the penguin?
[5931.28s -> 5931.78s]  Whatever.
[5932.24s -> 5938.69s]  All right, there's another one.
[5938.69s -> 5949.68s]  Penguin's organ trafficking.
[5949.68s -> 5950.80s]  All right, we're gonna do this one now.
[5951.66s -> 5952.30s]  It's pretty close.
[5981.79s -> 5982.51s]  Have a nice night.
[5986.77s -> 5988.29s]  I spawned right in front of that guy.
[5989.98s -> 5990.62s]  One guy.
[6000.26s -> 6000.82s]  God damn it.
[6001.46s -> 6005.46s]  All right.
[6006.08s -> 6008.08s]  Make sure I interrogate somebody.
[6008.08s -> 6008.96s]  It's really important.
[6009.60s -> 6031.07s]  They put that wall there just so you would run into it.
[6031.07s -> 6037.34s]  Should I just go...
[6037.34s -> 6038.70s]  What if I went the speed limit?
[6038.70s -> 6074.83s]  Let's go.
[6074.83s -> 6075.33s]  All right.
[6075.87s -> 6077.63s]  I have to interrogate someone.
[6077.63s -> 6081.58s]  Level five, right here.
[6082.22s -> 6083.04s]  Here it comes.
[6098.96s -> 6099.68s]  No interrogate?
[6101.04s -> 6109.01s]  What do you know?
[6119.25s -> 6120.05s]  Where's the container?
[6120.77s -> 6125.55s]  Oh, that's a plaque.
[6125.55s -> 6126.59s]  I have one minute?
[6126.59s -> 6127.47s]  Get away from me.
[6128.74s -> 6129.46s]  Get out of the way.
[6130.26s -> 6134.27s]  Where's the...
[6134.27s -> 6134.83s]  Where are the organs?
[6134.83s -> 6135.33s]  Where are they?
[6144.58s -> 6145.08s]  What?
[6148.45s -> 6149.49s]  Drop site, drop site, drop site.
[6149.49s -> 6149.99s]  Where is it?
[6150.61s -> 6153.15s]  I gotta go right now.
[6153.87s -> 6170.68s]  I got him.
[6187.94s -> 6188.66s]  I've got organs.
[6189.62s -> 6191.46s]  Do I give it to you?
[6192.10s -> 6193.36s]  All right, we're good.
[6202.45s -> 6203.81s]  Thanks for the delivery.
[6203.81s -> 6205.81s]  I've got a medical team lined up who can use it.
[6206.77s -> 6208.13s]  Glad I got here in time, man.
[6209.23s -> 6209.79s]  Nice.
[6209.79s -> 6210.11s]  All right.
[6210.11s -> 6212.35s]  So I'm messing with penguins still.
[6213.15s -> 6215.07s]  And is he pissed now?
[6215.87s -> 6222.82s]  Wait.
[6234.82s -> 6235.86s]  Why do they have a pig mask?
[6248.26s -> 6248.76s]  True.
[6249.06s -> 6252.45s]  Interrogate.
[6252.45s -> 6252.95s]  Nope.
[6253.49s -> 6256.98s]  They have spray paint?
[6258.34s -> 6259.78s]  All right.
[6259.78s -> 6260.98s]  I'm just gonna throw you all in the ocean.
[6275.14s -> 6284.32s]  Come here.
[6287.90s -> 6288.40s]  Yep.
[6288.72s -> 6290.08s]  Just go into the water already.
[6292.15s -> 6292.65s]  It hurt.
[6293.91s -> 6294.79s]  There's not water.
[6303.24s -> 6303.74s]  Oh.
[6304.44s -> 6307.04s]  I'm kind of afraid to jump in there.
[6314.24s -> 6314.56s]  All right.
[6314.56s -> 6321.12s]  So now we've got citizen chaos.
[6321.84s -> 6324.15s]  There's also...
[6324.15s -> 6325.35s]  Oh, Lucius box.
[6325.35s -> 6331.12s]  Fast travel, I think.
[6331.12s -> 6332.24s]  That's a fast travel unlock.
[6336.13s -> 6337.81s]  See what Detective Montoya wants.
[6338.37s -> 6342.85s]  Robbery in progress.
[6343.49s -> 6345.81s]  Probably this, right?
[6348.16s -> 6348.48s]  Oh, yeah.
[6348.48s -> 6349.36s]  I'll switch to Robin.
[6349.36s -> 6350.53s]  I'll switch to Robin.
[6351.09s -> 6355.16s]  Yeah, let's do that.
[6355.16s -> 6356.20s]  Let's check out...
[6356.20s -> 6357.64s]  I want to be able to play all the characters.
[6358.20s -> 6364.37s]  I want to do all the characters.
[6364.37s -> 6365.33s]  So you can vote.
[6365.33s -> 6366.21s]  See, two crimes stopped.
[6366.21s -> 6370.13s]  I'm good.
[6370.13s -> 6371.17s]  18 enemies defeated.
[6371.17s -> 6372.29s]  Two silent taketowns.
[6372.29s -> 6376.69s]  Yeah.
[6376.69s -> 6377.25s]  All right.
[6377.25s -> 6378.90s]  Get a poll in here.
[6378.90s -> 6383.89s]  Batgirl or Robin for the last portion of the sponsor segment.
[6383.89s -> 6388.12s]  Which, by the way, WB, thanks again for the sponsorship.
[6388.12s -> 6394.92s]  Game's available right now.
[6394.92s -> 6396.68s]  I got a link in the panel below.
[6397.24s -> 6402.98s]  Who do you want to save for the next 30 minutes or so?
[6402.98s -> 6409.04s]  I have to pee again.
[6409.04s -> 6411.20s]  I keep needing to pee.
[6411.84s -> 6415.49s]  Well, I'm drinking a lot of water.
[6415.49s -> 6416.13s]  All right.
[6416.13s -> 6417.09s]  I'll be back when the poll's done.
[6417.89s -> 6418.45s]  One more pee.
[6419.09s -> 6514.16s]  All right.
[6514.16s -> 6517.57s]  How are we doing?
[6517.57s -> 6518.21s]  Batgirl.
[6518.21s -> 6518.85s]  All right.
[6518.85s -> 6521.73s]  I'll play Robin tomorrow.
[6521.73s -> 6531.62s]  I'll play a combination of them both.
[6531.62s -> 6543.84s]  That's fair.
[6543.84s -> 6544.47s]  All right.
[6544.47s -> 6545.43s]  Let's do Batgirl.
[6545.43s -> 6559.17s]  There are four characters.
[6559.17s -> 6560.85s]  Robin's the only one we are not going to see tonight,
[6560.85s -> 6563.01s]  but you'll see Batgirl and Robin tomorrow.
[6563.01s -> 6565.56s]  You promised us Robin.
[6565.56s -> 6567.32s]  WB, you got to save the best for last.
[6567.32s -> 6579.25s]  You saved the best for last.
[6579.25s -> 6591.08s]  Play as Alfred.
[6591.08s -> 6592.76s]  I don't think you can play as Alfred.
[6592.76s -> 6596.87s]  All right.
[6596.87s -> 6597.35s]  Batgirl.
[6602.37s -> 6604.92s]  Expert hacker.
[6604.92s -> 6606.04s]  Let's do it.
[6612.93s -> 6616.13s]  Oh, I was like, wait, where's my costume?
[6616.13s -> 6618.09s]  OK.
[6624.13s -> 6625.97s]  So anything update so far?
[6626.69s -> 6627.91s]  Look at the board.
[6633.09s -> 6633.57s]  OK.
[6633.57s -> 6637.03s]  So let's go talk to...
[6640.10s -> 6640.42s]  OK.
[6642.37s -> 6642.61s]  All right.
[6642.61s -> 6643.25s]  So we did those two.
[6643.25s -> 6645.17s]  We got to talk to Lucius Fox and Detective Montoya.
[6645.17s -> 6651.14s]  So let's go talk to them both.
[6651.14s -> 6653.38s]  I do want to see what Batgirl's moves are.
[6653.94s -> 6655.13s]  I know.
[6659.28s -> 6660.56s]  I think my teeth are falling out.
[6660.56s -> 6661.28s]  Oh, Jesus.
[6668.07s -> 6668.55s]  All right.
[6668.55s -> 6669.05s]  Batgirl.
[6669.59s -> 6670.39s]  What do you got for moves?
[6671.48s -> 6671.98s]  Whoa.
[6672.60s -> 6673.40s]  What is that?
[6680.32s -> 6682.32s]  She's got like a baton nunchuck?
[6682.88s -> 6684.69s]  That's her ranged.
[6685.94s -> 6686.74s]  Yeah, she throws.
[6686.74s -> 6687.46s]  She throws shit.
[6688.10s -> 6693.00s]  She has the batarang, right?
[6697.16s -> 6697.88s]  Cool.
[6697.88s -> 6699.00s]  What about gear?
[6701.70s -> 6702.34s]  Different suits.
[6703.68s -> 6704.18s]  Cool.
[6704.72s -> 6705.75s]  I like this one.
[6708.05s -> 6708.45s]  OK.
[6708.45s -> 6708.95s]  Cool.
[6710.96s -> 6711.28s]  OK.
[6711.28s -> 6712.48s]  Well, it's definitely going to be this one.
[6713.04s -> 6719.09s]  Tonfa.
[6723.51s -> 6724.01s]  Cool.
[6725.97s -> 6726.47s]  All right.
[6726.93s -> 6727.94s]  So let's do the...
[6728.82s -> 6729.86s]  Let's go this way.
[6733.64s -> 6734.36s]  Gotham Knights.
[6735.32s -> 6737.32s]  Available right now on PC.
[6737.32s -> 6738.28s]  PlayStation 5.
[6738.28s -> 6740.60s]  Xbox Series X, Series S.
[6742.13s -> 6742.69s]  It's there.
[6742.69s -> 6743.57s]  It came out today.
[6744.29s -> 6745.75s]  Why are you so narrow?
[6746.76s -> 6748.92s]  I'll fix my webcam when we play the scary game, OK?
[6756.07s -> 6756.87s]  Open world.
[6756.87s -> 6758.07s]  Here's the whole map.
[6758.07s -> 6758.87s]  Co-op.
[6758.87s -> 6763.22s]  The whole game.
[6763.22s -> 6764.58s]  I'm closest to...
[6764.58s -> 6766.32s]  I'm close to...
[6766.96s -> 6768.96s]  Detective Montoya will mark that.
[6768.96s -> 6772.44s]  Let's check out...
[6772.44s -> 6773.56s]  Oh, I need to do points.
[6776.26s -> 6778.50s]  Justice, grit, or oracle.
[6779.06s -> 6784.44s]  Using AR mode, Batgirl can disable certain devices like cameras,
[6784.44s -> 6785.08s]  turrets, and mines.
[6785.08s -> 6785.88s]  That's pretty amazing.
[6786.52s -> 6790.60s]  Increases Batgirl's base house by 40%.
[6791.64s -> 6793.20s]  That seems amazing.
[6794.72s -> 6796.64s]  Or Perfect Evade.
[6796.64s -> 6797.60s]  I feel like I want that.
[6799.28s -> 6800.88s]  I always start with Perfect Evade.
[6801.52s -> 6807.04s]  Critical damage.
[6807.92s -> 6808.48s]  Defense.
[6809.12s -> 6811.20s]  What is down this tree?
[6812.07s -> 6815.91s]  Overcharge an enemy's gun or device instantly applying a bioelectric...
[6815.91s -> 6817.67s]  A bioelectric elemental effect.
[6823.72s -> 6827.40s]  Most enemy attacks can't interrupt Batgirl's heavy melee attack.
[6827.40s -> 6829.17s]  That's pretty good.
[6829.17s -> 6834.26s]  Batgirl can revive herself once after her health is depleted.
[6834.26s -> 6835.30s]  OK, we're doing this tree.
[6839.73s -> 6841.17s]  No interruptions or...
[6841.17s -> 6842.37s]  This one's like defense, right?
[6845.89s -> 6850.05s]  Batgirl receives a 75% defense bonus when hit by an enemy counterattack.
[6850.05s -> 6851.25s]  We'll go with this one.
[6851.25s -> 6852.92s]  I can get them both.
[6854.56s -> 6854.80s]  Yeah.
[6856.32s -> 6857.68s]  Self-revive will be good.
[6858.96s -> 6859.28s]  OK.
[6861.06s -> 6861.70s]  All right.
[6862.50s -> 6864.77s]  Let's go.
[6864.77s -> 6881.52s]  I like the cape.
[6896.90s -> 6897.22s]  Cape.
[6898.50s -> 6899.54s]  C-A-P-E.
[6900.26s -> 6902.64s]  The cape.
[6933.12s -> 6935.73s]  It's scary every time.
[6949.94s -> 6950.42s]  All right.
[6950.42s -> 6951.06s]  Here we are.
[6951.06s -> 6951.30s]  Hi.
[6954.05s -> 6954.53s]  What do you got?
[6955.65s -> 6956.53s]  Some kind of mission?
[6958.96s -> 6960.48s]  Don't you sneak up on me like that.
[6961.43s -> 6962.31s]  I actually kind of did.
[6963.11s -> 6967.83s]  Not the bat I was expecting to see, but if he trusts you, so will I.
[6969.14s -> 6969.78s]  Likewise.
[6970.58s -> 6972.10s]  I assume you've got something in mind.
[6972.66s -> 6973.22s]  Fill me in.
[6974.60s -> 6979.16s]  Well, since we lost Gordon, some cops are back to playing dirty again.
[6980.04s -> 6983.72s]  Kane doesn't like it, but she's not doing much to stop it either.
[6984.93s -> 6985.65s]  So I've heard.
[6986.29s -> 6988.29s]  She's not half the commissioner he was.
[6989.51s -> 6991.99s]  I know Batman was helping Gordon clean up the force,
[6992.63s -> 6996.87s]  but now any cops who used to be on Gordon's team are getting their asses handed to them.
[6997.99s -> 7001.19s]  The gangs are ambushing them because they won't take bribes,
[7001.19s -> 7005.43s]  and dispatchers are giving them the worst assignments because they make trouble for everyone else.
[7006.63s -> 7009.27s]  Hoping the gangs will do their dirty work for them.
[7009.27s -> 7011.43s]  That's horrible.
[7012.39s -> 7017.76s]  Well, look, I hate to ask, but can you keep an eye on cops when they're facing off against the gangs?
[7018.88s -> 7023.76s]  I know a lot of my fellow officers have issues with vigilantes, but they need the help.
[7024.48s -> 7025.20s]  Watch out.
[7025.20s -> 7026.32s]  Helping is what I do.
[7027.12s -> 7031.20s]  And those who actually care about Gotham will hopefully see that we're on the same side.
[7032.32s -> 7032.72s]  Thanks.
[7033.60s -> 7037.12s]  I'll try to get you some resources to help you protect everyone in Gotham.
[7037.12s -> 7037.84s]  Not just us.
[7039.04s -> 7039.92s]  Sounds good to me.
[7040.88s -> 7041.94s]  Let's go.
[7043.92s -> 7044.24s]  Okay.
[7044.96s -> 7045.84s]  Side activity complete.
[7045.84s -> 7048.64s]  Contacts offer tasks to help clean up and protect Gotham City.
[7048.64s -> 7051.92s]  Help various contacts during patrols to earn distinct rewards.
[7055.72s -> 7056.04s]  Okay.
[7056.04s -> 7058.20s]  Hey, you saved someone's life out there.
[7059.08s -> 7063.06s]  So now we gotta go talk to the box.
[7063.78s -> 7071.25s]  Oh, is that a bat memory or something?
[7074.66s -> 7077.30s]  Oh, I gotta, my webcam's gotta go off for this.
[7077.30s -> 7079.33s]  These are cutscenes.
[7079.33s -> 7117.89s]  The game's multiplayer?
[7117.89s -> 7118.93s]  It is multiplayer.
[7118.93s -> 7119.41s]  The whole thing.
[7120.29s -> 7121.57s]  The whole thing's co-op.
[7121.57s -> 7135.06s]  What's a gal like you doing in a place like this?
[7136.69s -> 7137.33s]  Same as you.
[7138.69s -> 7139.33s]  Wait, did we?
[7139.33s -> 7142.34s]  You're visiting an old friend.
[7142.34s -> 7143.38s]  We do?
[7143.38s -> 7149.17s]  I keep waiting for him to step down and, I don't know, give some inspiring speech.
[7149.17s -> 7150.45s]  Tell us to get back to work.
[7151.33s -> 7152.85s]  Maybe he didn't think I was sticking around.
[7153.57s -> 7155.24s]  You would have hated this.
[7156.52s -> 7161.03s]  They put you on an actual damn pedestal.
[7161.03s -> 7162.23s]  Maybe he'd understand.
[7164.42s -> 7166.42s]  He always said people needed symbols.
[7168.90s -> 7169.86s]  Something to believe in.
[7171.99s -> 7174.87s]  Yeah, but we both know he met you bats.
[7175.75s -> 7182.61s]  Not him, except with the squared up jawline and better glasses.
[7183.49s -> 7184.93s]  They changed his face?
[7185.89s -> 7190.05s]  Yeah, it's hard to tell from here, but it looks nothing like him.
[7190.77s -> 7196.07s]  Wish we had him back.
[7197.11s -> 7199.46s]  Yeah, me too.
[7200.42s -> 7210.85s]  See you later, Jim, bat girl.
[7211.65s -> 7222.98s]  He looks just like I remember.
[7223.94s -> 7236.71s]  So that, yeah, so that's a, there are the, yeah, there's like little things around the
[7236.71s -> 7238.87s]  city you can think, activate cutscenes and stuff.
[7242.02s -> 7242.82s]  Let me link this.
[7243.38s -> 7254.50s]  There we go.
[7254.50s -> 7259.78s]  Okay, so I need to go to Lucius, who is down here.
[7259.78s -> 7261.38s]  He's pretty far away, isn't he?
[7263.46s -> 7263.94s]  Kind of.
[7269.16s -> 7273.32s]  Am I lazy and teleport back here and then go or, no, we got a crime right here.
[7273.32s -> 7274.04s]  I'm gonna do this one.
[7274.60s -> 7287.76s]  I also want to learn some moveset stuff with bat girl.
[7288.40s -> 7291.41s]  Yeah, we'll open up tomorrow with bat girl.
[7298.13s -> 7299.49s]  Well, the game, I mean.
[7299.49s -> 7301.81s]  We'll stream something else for the first couple of hours.
[7304.13s -> 7305.41s]  What is, what is happening here?
[7306.64s -> 7307.84s]  Investigate the crime scene.
[7314.56s -> 7316.24s]  Oh, wait, this person is dead on ground.
[7319.51s -> 7320.07s]  What happened?
[7320.63s -> 7328.64s]  Okay, let's investigate.
[7329.28s -> 7336.85s]  Oh my goodness.
[7336.85s -> 7338.85s]  Find five clues to learn what happened.
[7340.79s -> 7342.39s]  Got shot in the chest.
[7342.39s -> 7351.70s]  Okay, holding a ring.
[7351.70s -> 7354.58s]  Power worker's union ring must belong to the victim.
[7354.58s -> 7356.74s]  The motive of this crime was likely not monetary.
[7357.62s -> 7366.72s]  Notebook says data and notes on power boxes.
[7366.72s -> 7371.67s]  Ammo type is too common to trace.
[7371.67s -> 7375.56s]  Positive ID on the victim of Gotham.
[7375.56s -> 7377.40s]  City worker reported missing in recent weeks.
[7377.40s -> 7381.64s]  The regulators likely tried to glean information from him about the city power grid.
[7381.64s -> 7390.07s]  Which clue points to the current location of the suspects?
[7390.79s -> 7395.91s]  Wait, what?
[7395.91s -> 7401.17s]  It's, we're gonna go to the power grid, right?
[7401.73s -> 7414.04s]  Discover what happened and where the suspects are hiding.
[7414.60s -> 7418.26s]  Which clue points to the current location?
[7418.26s -> 7419.06s]  Oh, okay, okay.
[7419.86s -> 7422.10s]  I get it.
[7422.10s -> 7423.06s]  I have to select the clue.
[7423.06s -> 7424.50s]  So it's the power box shit.
[7431.70s -> 7434.16s]  And that's it, right?
[7434.16s -> 7435.12s]  Solve it.
[7435.12s -> 7436.42s]  Wait, it's not?
[7436.42s -> 7441.30s]  Gunpowder residue.
[7441.86s -> 7450.96s]  Wouldn't this say is where the location, where they are?
[7450.96s -> 7451.84s]  The ring?
[7451.84s -> 7453.81s]  Oh, right.
[7454.77s -> 7457.67s]  No, not correct.
[7457.67s -> 7468.40s]  Gunpowder?
[7468.40s -> 7469.44s]  Oh, all right.
[7470.08s -> 7475.28s]  Crime resolved.
[7475.28s -> 7477.84s]  Oh, I was gonna say that we didn't find them.
[7477.84s -> 7479.20s]  Okay, so now where are you?
[7479.20s -> 7482.55s]  Over here.
[7482.55s -> 7489.83s]  Is that illegal hacking?
[7489.83s -> 7493.30s]  Criminal in hiding.
[7493.30s -> 7495.86s]  All right, we'll do this and then we'll go wrap around to Lucius.
[7495.86s -> 7498.24s]  Is the camera still fucking up?
[7498.24s -> 7502.44s]  Is my camera still freaking out all the time or is it not bad right now?
[7506.45s -> 7510.66s]  Not really.
[7510.66s -> 7512.18s]  Yeah, I can see your bald spot.
[7512.18s -> 7513.46s]  Oh, that's all right.
[7513.46s -> 7525.25s]  I'm gonna try to see why that's happening.
[7525.81s -> 7527.17s]  I'll do some troubleshooting tonight.
[7527.89s -> 7528.85s]  So tomorrow it doesn't happen.
[7529.49s -> 7534.13s]  All right, let's go track this person down.
[7534.13s -> 7541.19s]  I don't have a bald spot.
[7541.19s -> 7544.20s]  Look, I'll go like this, look.
[7544.92s -> 7582.31s]  All right, so who's the killer?
[7582.87s -> 7604.48s]  Okay, reach the hideout.
[7604.48s -> 7615.36s]  Oh my God, there you are.
[7615.36s -> 7616.48s]  All right, you're on.
[7620.88s -> 7621.44s]  No, oh.
[7622.24s -> 7626.95s]  Beat two enemies at the same time.
[7628.13s -> 7629.41s]  Defeat with momentum abilities.
[7630.53s -> 7634.47s]  What's with their voices?
[7660.53s -> 7674.61s]  Oh, holy shit.
[7674.61s -> 7675.97s]  All right, that girl's pretty cool.
[7709.60s -> 7710.00s]  Nice.
[7713.17s -> 7715.17s]  They're not getting up anytime soon.
[7715.17s -> 7715.65s]  I did it.
[7716.45s -> 7727.44s]  All right, now Lucius.
[7727.44s -> 7728.24s]  There you are.
[7728.80s -> 7731.76s]  Made some pretty good progress, I think.
[7732.32s -> 7740.71s]  Where's my car?
[7740.71s -> 7747.84s]  I like you can just summon the car.
[7747.84s -> 7748.80s]  It just appears.
[7748.80s -> 7749.44s]  It's just ready.
[7750.08s -> 7761.33s]  How many beers do you drink in an hour?
[7761.33s -> 7765.75s]  I don't know.
[7765.75s -> 7766.79s]  We have one, who cares?
[7780.15s -> 7798.74s]  All right, cut scene.
[7798.74s -> 7800.74s]  No place like it, is there, Mr. Fox?
[7806.34s -> 7807.94s]  You're trying to give me another heart attack?
[7810.37s -> 7811.73s]  Batman taught you everything, huh?
[7812.37s -> 7813.57s]  Just the important things.
[7814.29s -> 7816.21s]  Sneaking up on your allies, for one.
[7820.07s -> 7823.51s]  But not how he managed to be in five places at once.
[7824.84s -> 7827.80s]  I feel like if I look away, everything turns to chaos.
[7829.00s -> 7830.04s]  You got a computer up here?
[7832.37s -> 7835.70s]  Bad doesn't fall far from the belt from what I've seen.
[7837.04s -> 7838.16s]  Um, thank you.
[7839.43s -> 7840.31s]  Don't thank me yet.
[7842.66s -> 7845.54s]  This is not a secure place to be doing work up here.
[7845.54s -> 7846.66s]  Like, this is kind of secret work.
[7847.38s -> 7855.24s]  Your mentor and I always knew that something like this could happen.
[7856.44s -> 7860.53s]  When I left Wayne Tech, we kept some research going.
[7860.53s -> 7863.03s]  There are a lot of eyes on you now.
[7864.05s -> 7865.41s]  No one's looking at Fox Tech.
[7865.41s -> 7867.09s]  Brain's gonna ruin that computer.
[7867.09s -> 7868.93s]  As long as I got a break between the guilds,
[7869.81s -> 7872.45s]  you'll still have everything you need to carry on Batman's legacy.
[7873.17s -> 7875.19s]  Speaking of which.
[7879.38s -> 7880.02s]  Whoa.
[7880.02s -> 7881.78s]  These flowers are gorgeous.
[7882.34s -> 7883.46s]  It's Luke's design.
[7884.02s -> 7886.68s]  A custom bird to help you get around a little quicker.
[7887.76s -> 7889.92s]  Hefty enough to support exactly one hero.
[7892.05s -> 7895.43s]  With this, the sky really is the limit.
[7897.35s -> 7898.31s]  Now you can thank me.
[7898.95s -> 7902.08s]  Thank you so much, Mr. Fox.
[7902.80s -> 7909.52s]  Do I actually get to fly this?
[7913.20s -> 7916.96s]  Belfry, if this isn't enough to convince Penguin, nothing left.
[7917.99s -> 7919.27s]  Be careful.
[7919.27s -> 7920.79s]  Penguin's going to have an angle here.
[7922.20s -> 7922.70s]  Okay.
[7924.10s -> 7924.50s]  Reach...
[7924.50s -> 7925.78s]  All right, we're going back to the launch.
[7925.78s -> 7927.86s]  I'm dying to try this baby out.
[7927.86s -> 7928.58s]  How do I start?
[7929.46s -> 7931.10s]  You're getting ahead of yourself.
[7931.66s -> 7935.02s]  Before you can use the bird, you'll have to clear a path for it.
[7935.02s -> 7935.83s]  Clear a path?
[7935.83s -> 7936.71s]  Whatever I need to do.
[7938.10s -> 7941.94s]  Lately, the GCPD is not content to have jackboots on the ground.
[7941.94s -> 7942.98s]  Somebody's shooting a machine gun.
[7942.98s -> 7946.42s]  They launched a network of surveillance drones to patrol the skies.
[7947.62s -> 7950.42s]  If they're looking for you when you try to get airborne.
[7950.42s -> 7952.58s]  They won't hesitate to take me down.
[7953.30s -> 7954.26s]  What do you recommend?
[7955.62s -> 7960.26s]  A creative programmer could convince those drones to overlook certain targets.
[7961.22s -> 7964.66s]  But for that to work, close-up scans would be required.
[7967.10s -> 7970.14s]  For once, I'm not the one who has to handle the programming.
[7970.78s -> 7972.38s]  I'll get you those scans, Mr. Fox.
[7972.38s -> 7973.98s]  Get to solve crimes?
[7973.98s -> 7976.22s]  The cops have the city divided into sectors.
[7976.78s -> 7978.78s]  The set of drones watching over each one.
[7979.90s -> 7983.90s]  Until you scan all the drones in a sector, consider it a no-fly zone.
[7984.86s -> 7988.14s]  No flying until the surveillance drones are taken care of?
[7988.78s -> 7989.34s]  No problem.
[7990.70s -> 7993.74s]  I'll send you the location of the first one so you can get to work.
[7995.34s -> 7998.20s]  Okay, so we could also...
[7998.20s -> 7998.84s]  Let's do the...
[7999.72s -> 8000.60s]  I'll do that later.
[8002.33s -> 8003.13s]  Let's go do this.
[8004.47s -> 8008.42s]  Yeah, let's go take on Penguin.
[8008.98s -> 8010.02s]  I'm ready.
[8010.02s -> 8024.82s]  Only two crimes?
[8025.88s -> 8026.28s]  Well, I'm...
[8026.28s -> 8028.20s]  You'd better not be hurt this time.
[8028.20s -> 8029.00s]  I'm working on it.
[8029.64s -> 8041.50s]  Are you going to do a face reveal?
[8042.42s -> 8044.26s]  It's very, very soon.
[8044.26s -> 8044.90s]  Very soon.
[8045.46s -> 8046.66s]  In like five minutes.
[8047.22s -> 8050.82s]  Face reveal in five minutes.
[8051.38s -> 8060.81s]  Wait, what?
[8063.66s -> 8066.57s]  Uh, I've got to stop Penguin.
[8067.21s -> 8081.98s]  Dude, I'll be here.
[8081.98s -> 8082.22s]  Yep.
[8082.86s -> 8085.72s]  For the first time ever, you're going to see my face.
[8086.44s -> 8094.06s]  All right.
[8095.96s -> 8097.64s]  I wonder if you actually fight the Penguin.
[8099.99s -> 8101.27s]  I'm so curious about this.
[8101.91s -> 8123.14s]  Talk to the Penguin.
[8123.14s -> 8126.68s]  I'm here.
[8126.68s -> 8128.44s]  Defeat the Penguin's guards.
[8128.44s -> 8129.56s]  Avoid taking damage.
[8129.56s -> 8132.63s]  All right, well, I couldn't say anything about stealth.
[8141.83s -> 8145.59s]  This game really makes you feel like Batgirl.
[8145.59s -> 8151.14s]  Don't think so.
[8157.56s -> 8158.76s]  Shit, I got hurt.
[8159.32s -> 8164.28s]  Okay, nice.
[8173.18s -> 8174.62s]  She's kicking the shit out of us.
[8177.46s -> 8178.10s]  Oh my...
[8181.66s -> 8182.78s]  You can't fit in here.
[8188.09s -> 8199.46s]  All right, that was pretty cool.
[8201.67s -> 8202.87s]  All right, Batgirl is part of the...
[8202.87s -> 8204.07s]  Batgirl is the coolest character in the game.
[8211.99s -> 8213.11s]  No, please.
[8216.07s -> 8225.26s]  Cool, cool, cool.
[8229.37s -> 8229.61s]  Nice.
[8235.26s -> 8235.82s]  Penguin!
[8239.58s -> 8240.54s]  Nowhere to go anywhere.
[8240.54s -> 8241.58s]  Nowhere to hide, Penguin.
[8243.26s -> 8243.74s]  Open up.
[8244.30s -> 8247.46s]  I'm going to have a rocket launcher pointing at what they're doing.
[8248.58s -> 8251.18s]  So you can use the door after...
[8251.18s -> 8252.06s]  So where were we?
[8257.21s -> 8275.34s]  Listening.
[8275.34s -> 8280.54s]  You may have questions, but I can think of a few reasons not to answer them.
[8288.73s -> 8290.65s]  They could have probably just heard that with music.
[8291.29s -> 8295.54s]  Am I supposed to be acting?
[8302.42s -> 8303.38s]  Oh, okay.
[8305.56s -> 8307.00s]  There's one in the chess set.
[8309.18s -> 8310.78s]  Well, I'm an expert hacker, so I got this.
[8321.70s -> 8322.26s]  Where are the bugs?
[8324.26s -> 8324.98s]  Where are the bugs?
[8328.17s -> 8330.98s]  All right, so I'm going to pick up one of these bugs.
[8330.98s -> 8332.26s]  Things that's bugged.
[8332.26s -> 8332.90s]  I'm going to turn it.
[8332.90s -> 8336.10s]  I'm going to aim my mouth right where the bug is as close as I can.
[8336.10s -> 8336.58s]  And I'm going to go...
[8338.55s -> 8346.25s]  Where are they?
[8356.58s -> 8357.30s]  Where are the bugs?
[8359.86s -> 8360.50s]  Where are the bugs?
[8361.06s -> 8368.26s]  I need to just smash them.
[8368.26s -> 8371.40s]  Under the desk or something?
[8371.96s -> 8380.68s]  Okay.
[8380.68s -> 8381.00s]  How do I...
[8381.00s -> 8381.56s]  Can I punch?
[8390.98s -> 8391.70s]  The face reveal?
[8392.34s -> 8394.02s]  Dude, don't rush it.
[8397.58s -> 8398.94s]  Oh, okay.
[8398.94s -> 8418.14s]  How do I destroy them then?
[8418.14s -> 8418.78s]  Plant.
[8418.78s -> 8425.70s]  Yeah, she's an expert hacker.
[8425.70s -> 8429.19s]  Two and one more.
[8429.19s -> 8436.30s]  I feel like I could probably do this.
[8436.30s -> 8437.18s]  The singing.
[8437.18s -> 8448.42s]  It's...
[8449.30s -> 8450.82s]  I'm kind of afraid that it will be...
[8450.82s -> 8455.34s]  It's either going to be, wow, holy shit, I can't believe you can actually do that.
[8455.34s -> 8459.94s]  Or that was like the cringiest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
[8459.94s -> 8461.62s]  And I'm not sure which one.
[8461.62s -> 8462.58s]  I'm kind of afraid to do it.
[8469.70s -> 8471.14s]  Bring over that bottle of whiskey.
[8472.50s -> 8475.61s]  You want to try?
[8480.06s -> 8481.42s]  This is like really fucking dumb.
[8481.98s -> 8489.22s]  I'll try after.
[8489.22s -> 8490.58s]  Here's what I don't get.
[8490.58s -> 8494.58s]  How come you had to serve your sentence while the rest of your rich friends got a free pass?
[8497.46s -> 8498.50s]  They were favored.
[8499.91s -> 8500.71s]  I wasn't.
[8500.71s -> 8501.67s]  Who'd you piss off?
[8503.98s -> 8505.82s]  No one talks about them.
[8505.82s -> 8506.54s]  A lot of whiskey.
[8506.54s -> 8508.70s]  Not a whispered word is said.
[8510.47s -> 8512.31s]  The court of owls isn't real.
[8513.19s -> 8520.62s]  This is how you get off your chair.
[8520.62s -> 8521.10s]  Yes, it is.
[8521.10s -> 8522.22s]  The powers club.
[8522.22s -> 8522.72s]  Yup.
[8523.83s -> 8526.87s]  Where the super rich go for shits and giggles.
[8527.59s -> 8528.55s]  Might be worth a peek.
[8529.43s -> 8532.95s]  Personally, I stay far away from that raptor's nest.
[8534.23s -> 8535.67s]  But it's fine if I head in there.
[8538.14s -> 8541.18s]  I lost years of my life to Blackgate.
[8542.70s -> 8544.78s]  You go do what you do best.
[8548.70s -> 8550.94s]  Just don't tell them I sent you.
[8550.94s -> 8551.98s]  Is he a good guy?
[8551.98s -> 8552.78s]  Is he a bad guy?
[8554.94s -> 8555.58s]  All right, I'll try.
[8562.98s -> 8563.62s]  A little practice.
[8563.62s -> 8564.34s]  I probably hurt somebody.
[8564.34s -> 8564.84s]  I'm sorry.
[8565.80s -> 8566.92s]  Do you think he's up to something?
[8568.06s -> 8569.26s]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[8569.98s -> 8572.86s]  But he seems pretty convinced that the court of owls exists.
[8574.14s -> 8577.32s]  Okay, I'll do a deep dive on the court while you're out.
[8577.32s -> 8578.20s]  Sounds good.
[8578.20s -> 8578.70s]  Awful.
[8588.30s -> 8591.03s]  Very cool.
[8591.03s -> 8592.31s]  All right, let's put some points in.
[8592.31s -> 8596.20s]  Let's go back to the bat cave, whatever it is.
[8596.20s -> 8597.24s]  I'll do my face reveal.
[8597.24s -> 8599.40s]  And then we're going to move on to another game.
[8600.04s -> 8601.77s]  We're going to play Deadly Night.
[8613.99s -> 8614.63s]  Okay.
[8614.63s -> 8615.51s]  Check on Alfred.
[8617.99s -> 8619.24s]  What's that sound?
[8627.69s -> 8628.97s]  Probably a mother hen?
[8639.22s -> 8639.94s]  What the hell?
[8641.02s -> 8641.34s]  All right.
[8642.42s -> 8648.18s]  That is going to be it for today for this game.
[8649.62s -> 8652.98s]  We're going to move on to Deadly Night.
[8653.54s -> 8656.15s]  That was Gotham Knights again.
[8656.15s -> 8657.59s]  The game is out now.
[8658.78s -> 8659.50s]  It is available.
[8660.22s -> 8668.34s]  You can get it right now on PS5, Xbox Series X, Series S, PC.
[8668.34s -> 8672.76s]  There's a link in the panel image.
[8672.76s -> 8679.51s]  And also we'll be playing it tomorrow.
[8679.51s -> 8681.75s]  Thank you, Warner Brothers again for the sponsor.
[8681.75s -> 8683.51s]  I know this has been like an Omega sponsor.
[8684.23s -> 8687.03s]  But WB has been really awesome to work with.
[8687.03s -> 8689.11s]  And it's been a great supporter of the channel.
[8689.11s -> 8691.19s]  So I'm having fun with it.
[8691.91s -> 8696.49s]  Like I said yesterday, I would be lying to you if I told you that
[8696.49s -> 8697.85s]  I was not enjoying my experience.
[8703.03s -> 8705.91s]  Open world games are just kind of fun to mess around in.
[8705.91s -> 8708.30s]  And here comes the face reveal.
[8708.30s -> 8709.10s]  Okay, here we go.
[8725.43s -> 8725.99s]  Was it all right?
[8734.41s -> 8735.93s]  All right, give me two minutes.
[8735.93s -> 8736.81s]  I'll be right back.
[8736.81s -> 8738.73s]  We're going to switch to Deadly Night.
[8738.73s -> 8740.09s]  It's a scary game.
[8740.09s -> 8741.85s]  It's late at night now.
[8741.85s -> 8743.29s]  It's going to be terrifying.
[8743.29s -> 8745.19s]  And I'm going to play it.
[8745.19s -> 8746.23s]  It is not a controller game.
[8746.23s -> 8749.75s]  So give me like two, three minutes to get this ready.
[8749.75s -> 8751.88s]  I'll be right back.
[8755.88s -> 8761.69s]  And again, there'll be more Gotham Knights tomorrow.
[8761.69s -> 8763.02s]  See you soon.
[8763.02s -> 8764.70s]  See you in two minutes.
