[5.30s -> 19.12s]  Father? Father? When can I go and play with the puppies, daddy? I'm Lucius. I'm Lucius. I'm such a bad boy, such a bad bad boy. I'm Lucius. I'm Lucius. I'm gonna kill you.
[19.12s -> 22.00s]  What? What?
[22.00s -> 26.16s]  Please let that be in the video.
[26.16s -> 29.53s]  What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's wrong with this guy?
[29.53s -> 44.22s]  This guy was just trying to get me, and yell at me and stuff, and now he's just marveling at the sink.
[44.22s -> 47.89s]  So we're gonna try this. Hello?
[47.89s -> 51.13s]  That's it. I'm taking you to the authorities.
[51.13s -> 54.94s]  Yes, please. Take me to the authorities.
[54.94s -> 60.94s]  You would seriously think that after doing this like 15 to 16 times, this guy would look down and be like, I shouldn't walk on the green shit.
[60.94s -> 62.94s]  No. Of course not.
[62.94s -> 67.42s]  What the hell?
[67.42s -> 82.61s]  I'm Lucius. I'm Lucius. Hello, nurse. Hey, what's going on, guy? I'm Lucius. I'm Lucius. I'm gonna take over your fucking mind. I'm Lucius. I'm Lucius. I'm gonna go walk into a...
[82.61s -> 92.27s]  I'm scared.
[97.51s -> 99.82s]  What am I seeing?
[99.82s -> 112.10s]  Dude, I'm like a supernatural psycho dragging her on a bookshelf. Like, what do you mean, what am I seeing?
[112.10s -> 115.04s]  What the fuck is...
[115.04s -> 117.04s]  Pick up those shaggy butts. Pick up those shaggy butts.
[117.04s -> 120.82s]  Oh, she actually did.
[120.82s -> 123.82s]  She just took them. What? You stole those cigarettes?
[123.82s -> 127.34s]  I clearly threw those on the ground.
[127.34s -> 131.34s]  So now, I'm gonna fucking can ya.
[132.34s -> 134.34s]  You wanna get canned?
[134.34s -> 136.34s]  You ever been to Kansas? I'm gonna fucking can ya.
[136.34s -> 138.77s]  This lady keeps ducking.
[138.77s -> 142.35s]  What are you eating? Invisible food?
[142.35s -> 146.35s]  I love invisible food. What about the guy on the left? What's he doing here? Just wearing that nice shirt.
[146.35s -> 148.35s]  Fucking naked guy. Just walking through.
[148.35s -> 163.11s]  This guy's not gonna have... He's gonna have a lot of trouble.
[163.11s -> 168.09s]  What the fuck?
[168.09s -> 170.90s]  You dropped it.
[170.90s -> 173.90s]  You didn't even do anything. You dropped it, dude.
[173.90s -> 179.70s]  This... Without context, this is really strange.
[180.70s -> 185.86s]  What's this guy's story? I wanna know his full story.
[185.86s -> 189.43s]  Yeah, your arm's gonna be fine. Don't worry.
[189.43s -> 193.43s]  I mean, we're in a hospital right now. You're probably here for surgery or something.
[193.43s -> 196.43s]  Let me get you to your emergency room, surgery room.
[196.43s -> 197.43s]  Geez.
[197.43s -> 201.67s]  So on the right here, as you can see, I'm gonna give you a little quick tour before we go to your room.
[201.67s -> 205.67s]  That's gonna be the operating room, but I wanna introduce you to one of my favorite doctors.
[205.67s -> 207.67s]  Over here is Dr. Dean Dingleman.
[207.67s -> 210.67s]  Dean Dingleman, here's the patient you'll be operating on.
[210.67s -> 213.67s]  His name is Kryden, Kaden, whatever his name is.
[213.67s -> 218.91s]  I just wanted to give you a close interaction with the doctor before you go and prep for surgery.
[218.91s -> 221.91s]  Just take you up a floor or two. That's all we gotta do here. Just don't mind me.
[221.91s -> 223.91s]  I mean, this thing's always broken.
[223.91s -> 226.91s]  Gotta throw a can of dog food at it to make sure we can get it open.
[226.91s -> 228.91s]  But yeah, I mean, can you believe that weather?
[228.91s -> 231.91s]  I mean, we had like a foot of snow today. I mean, can't you believe...
[231.91s -> 236.20s]  No.
[236.20s -> 239.72s]  You're not gonna let me push him out the elevator?
[239.72s -> 241.72s]  Let me push a guy out a fucking elevator.
[241.72s -> 245.28s]  Fucking high C ectocoola. Let's see how you deal with this one.
[245.28s -> 247.28s]  All right, sir, so go ahead and... I knew it.
[247.28s -> 251.28s]  They always slip. It doesn't matter if they're sitting, if they're on a fucking workout bench.
[251.28s -> 253.28s]  It doesn't matter. It does not matter.
[253.28s -> 269.07s]  I didn't even... I didn't do that.
[269.07s -> 272.57s]  Everybody just saw that I came back from...
[272.57s -> 274.57s]  I loaded into the game, and this happened.
[274.57s -> 277.57s]  I don't know what happened here. I had nothing to do with this.
[277.57s -> 279.57s]  Absolutely nothing to do with it.
[279.57s -> 287.76s]  Who's gonna get the sandwich first?
[287.76s -> 293.07s]  Everybody wanted the sandwich.
[294.07s -> 296.07s]  What?
[296.07s -> 299.27s]  I didn't poison that sandwich.
[299.27s -> 301.27s]  I did not poison that sandwich.
[301.27s -> 303.27s]  That guy just died.
[303.27s -> 305.27s]  Because he ate a dirty sandwich.
[305.27s -> 316.71s]  Just a second here.
[316.71s -> 318.95s]  So you two, that's normal.
[318.95s -> 320.95s]  You should be doing that.
[320.95s -> 323.95s]  There's no reason why two people can't be sitting in the same spot at the same time.
[323.95s -> 330.53s]  I mean, why...
[330.53s -> 334.35s]  What are you doing?
[334.35s -> 336.35s]  Hey guys, welcome to my new hit series called...
[336.35s -> 338.35s]  What would happen if this would happen?
[338.35s -> 340.35s]  So today, in this new episode of...
[340.35s -> 342.35s]  What would happen if this was gonna happen?
[342.35s -> 344.35s]  We have a thing of donuts here.
[344.35s -> 346.35s]  And we've got these pills. We're gonna combine them.
[346.35s -> 348.35s]  And we're gonna see, you know...
[348.35s -> 350.35s]  What would happen if this was gonna happen?
[350.35s -> 352.35s]  See, the doctor here, he doesn't even know there's donuts behind him.
[352.35s -> 354.35s]  He's gonna pick up those donuts.
[354.35s -> 356.35s]  Oh man, I mean, what's gonna happen here?
[356.35s -> 358.35s]  He's gonna eat these donuts. He loves donuts.
[358.35s -> 360.35s]  With a giant pill box on them.
[362.35s -> 364.35s]  So, next episode on...
[364.35s -> 366.98s]  What would happen if this was gonna happen?
