[4.92s -> 18.44s]  What's happening? How are you doing? You said no delays? It's 402. It's 402.
[18.44s -> 30.09s]  I actually turned the stream on at 401. No, there were no delays. 120 seconds late. Yeah.
[30.09s -> 43.12s]  Whatever. How you guys doing? It's Cuphead time. Yep. Funny story about Cuphead.
[43.12s -> 50.42s]  So I obviously reinstalled it. I got into the game. Just to get a feel again to how
[50.42s -> 56.58s]  the game works and everything, right? And I beat, because my save file didn't carry over for some
[56.58s -> 64.24s]  reason. I don't know why. It's been a long time. So I beat the first five or six bosses and kind
[64.24s -> 67.52s]  of painfully went through some of the running gun levels just to get some money to be able to get
[67.52s -> 74.84s]  some of the upgrades. And I was like, I fucking hate this game. It's like, I hate this. And the
[74.84s -> 96.32s]  DLC fights are apparently like a way harder, right? So I figured that would be a funny title. Now,
[96.32s -> 102.50s]  I'm kidding. It's going to be fun, but I don't have my save file. So I don't have all the
[102.50s -> 106.90s]  unlockables, but I don't need the unlockables. This is all I need. I need the spreader,
[107.70s -> 113.62s]  the invincibility power up. And that's it. That's it. That's it. Don't, I don't care about anything
[113.62s -> 122.66s]  else. Just give me the spreader attack and the invincibility. And I got it already. I'm ready to
[122.66s -> 130.82s]  go. You want the homing one? Well, if I have problems, I can, I have smoke dash too. Yeah.
[130.82s -> 136.55s]  I got, I got enough to make it so I was gonna get destroyed, right? I also, okay. I got to remember
[136.55s -> 146.90s]  how I did the controls last time. Did I make B dodge or circle dodge on PS4? Cause it triangle
[146.90s -> 160.00s]  or what triangle or Y is dodge by default. I'm trying to remember what I did. Does anyone
[160.00s -> 172.13s]  remember? Did I do R? I did R2. R2 is probably not a bad idea. R2 for dodge. Shit. That's actually
[172.13s -> 178.84s]  really good idea. I might do that. I did change it. I remember I did. Cause I was, I got really
[178.84s -> 195.51s]  mad. But before we do anything, I have to have a few announcements. Announcement number one
[196.31s -> 199.43s]  is very, it's about the green screen. I told you I'd have some things ready for you.
[200.56s -> 212.47s]  So everybody tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Hello. Hello. You have, and should I wait? Well,
[212.47s -> 223.43s]  I wait till a lot of people get here. Is this your face on the moon and the planets?
[224.71s -> 237.86s]  What kind of ego megalomaniac would do something like that? He's a NASA imagery. Okay. Well,
[237.86s -> 254.28s]  let's wait. Just wait a minute. Just hang on a minute. The best part about this is I,
[255.24s -> 263.64s]  I could have had this changed a bunch of times by now. Since this thing was created, there's what?
[263.72s -> 272.98s]  Three or four other planets. Only two planets exist in this. So it's Earth, Jupiter, the moon
[272.98s -> 276.98s]  and the sun. That's it. There's no other planets. And we have every planet at this point.
[279.33s -> 282.37s]  I like to think that at some points, I don't know. It's funny to me.
[284.56s -> 288.80s]  You put the emotes in chat right now that are not in the solar system in the intro.
[289.52s -> 308.45s]  Jeremiah, I haven't watched in a year. Let's go. Hold on. I have a couple of announcements.
[308.45s -> 315.65s]  I have a couple of things to talk about. And I'm just hanging out. We're just sitting around.
[315.65s -> 320.87s]  I haven't watched you in 10 years. You know, it's kind of funny. Somebody could actually have said
[320.87s -> 327.35s]  that. Hey, dude, I watched your grandpa insane aquarium video. And then I didn't come back for
[327.35s -> 339.12s]  10 years. You could actually say that. That's that that much time has gone by. All right,
[339.12s -> 341.92s]  are you ready? Here we go. All right, let's talk about green screens. First of all,
[343.06s -> 357.22s]  green screen you have until 1201 on Monday the 18th to submit a green screen video.
[359.03s -> 368.64s]  That is precisely two weeks from this moment right now. Pacific. So essentially Sunday the 17th at
[368.64s -> 377.38s]  night. If he's not if it's not ready, it's not right. You have two weeks. There are rules you
[377.38s -> 382.68s]  need to follow. They are in the discord right now. They're posted there for you to read.
[384.44s -> 392.45s]  Read the entire set of rules before you do anything. That's too long. I'm gonna forget.
[393.25s -> 405.35s]  He's giving us homework. What do you mean rules? There are there are rules. Tell us the rules.
[406.07s -> 409.91s]  I mean, I could tell you the rules or you could just go read the rules right now.
[409.91s -> 416.45s]  Right this very second. You could want to read you the rules.
[418.79s -> 428.71s]  Do you have to hear it from me? Is that what it is? Would you like me to read you the rules?
[428.71s -> 434.31s]  All right, let me read that. They will be posted in the look. There's going to be a form.
[434.31s -> 441.04s]  It's going to don't worry. Just just keep an eye on the discord. There'll be announcements.
[441.04s -> 446.48s]  There'll be things just go look in the green screen submissions form. I can read you the
[446.48s -> 457.96s]  rules that you want. Let's do that. Fine. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, rule number one. Listen to
[457.96s -> 463.81s]  me. Let me find them because I I've wrote them and I need to find where where they are.
[465.76s -> 476.82s]  Here they are. Ladies and gentlemen, your submission submissions must be between
[476.82s -> 486.63s]  10 seconds and three minutes. And they have to be uploaded to YouTube between 10 seconds
[486.63s -> 497.06s]  and three minutes. Just like in previous years. Also, if your video is of me just dancing
[497.06s -> 505.76s]  or of a song or something, it cannot be longer than 30 seconds. 30 seconds for kind of a dancing
[505.76s -> 513.65s]  loop. That's what it is. 11 seconds. Got it. Yeah, that's fine. There is a max of stop
[513.65s -> 518.90s]  residents sleep. Bring me this is important green screen information. There's a max of two
[518.90s -> 523.30s]  submissions. I really have just going over the syllabus. Can I just play Cuphead now?
[524.10s -> 531.03s]  I feel like a teacher. There's a max of two submissions per user. This actually is really
[531.03s -> 536.92s]  important. I need to make this really clear. This rule is important. Listen to me. You can only
[536.92s -> 543.40s]  submit two times. If you have previously submitted a video for an old community content night,
[544.93s -> 551.09s]  and you want to resubmit it. That submission had to have come in after the last time we did the
[551.09s -> 559.11s]  broadcast. May 22 2020. So do not submit something before 2020. That is a green screen edit that you
[559.11s -> 565.59s]  still have. They're not going to be accepted. But on top of that, if you do fall in that category,
[565.59s -> 571.75s]  if you do fall in that category, it is incredibly highly encouraged that you reevaluate the video
[571.75s -> 577.56s]  and add some potential new content. Think about how much time has passed since we last did this.
[577.56s -> 581.16s]  A lot of the jokes in some of these videos from two years ago, probably not relevant anymore.
[584.42s -> 587.78s]  So I'd rather have stuff from recent time than from two or three years ago.
[588.50s -> 594.90s]  But you guys told me to read this. You guys, you told me to read this. You said I want to know.
[594.90s -> 606.05s]  Read it to me. Okay, here's the next rule. This is lame. I'm explaining the rules. All right,
[606.05s -> 609.73s]  you know what? You can read it. If you don't, by the way, no, you know what? Fuck that. I'm
[609.73s -> 613.17s]  not going to read you the rules anymore. If you want to know the rules, go read it. If you don't
[613.17s -> 616.05s]  read the rules and you submit something and you didn't follow the rules, you're going to get
[616.05s -> 623.88s]  snapped out. Okay. The amount of submissions will likely be five to 10 times larger than any previous
[623.88s -> 629.16s]  time we've ever done this. So any submission that comes in will potentially not be shown or
[629.16s -> 637.46s]  seen regardless of its quality. There are 10 rules. You're going to be here for a while. You
[637.46s -> 647.41s]  little shit. Whatever. You can read them if you want. Somebody tell me my porn setting was on.
[648.23s -> 655.76s]  Oh, this is okay. This is pinned. These are pinned messages. Oops. All right, let's play Cuphead.
[655.76s -> 670.21s]  Fine. I don't want to read anything. Well, that would have been fun to hear that delicious last
[670.21s -> 683.12s]  course. It's a delicious last class. It's kind of loud. How loud is that? Okay. All right,
[683.12s -> 698.53s]  you guys ready? What's up? You guys good? Good. What's a good place for a webcam for this game?
[704.02s -> 710.40s]  Those roles aren't put up yet, so nobody can read them. Oops. They'll be there, but you got two
[710.40s -> 714.40s]  weeks to make the video. You can just read the rules. They'll be there in like an hour.
[718.24s -> 729.78s]  Why does it look off center? Is that off center? Whatever. All right, Cuphead DLC. Let's go.
[733.14s -> 747.70s]  Yeah, 48% already in the main game. What? I played for like two hours last night. What? All right,
[747.70s -> 756.77s]  so I wanted to get some money. Center right. What do you mean? Like over here? Like here? I feel
[756.77s -> 763.30s]  like that's going to block a bunch of shit though, isn't it? Was it down here? Should I even just
[763.30s -> 773.78s]  turn the webcam off? Bottom right's better. Doesn't that show lives though? I don't know.
[773.78s -> 777.38s]  Yeah, I know this film grain in this game. You can't turn it off unless you go into like the
[777.38s -> 780.42s]  system files, but whatever. I would probably, I would turn it off and somebody would say I was
[780.42s -> 786.79s]  cheating. You know what I mean? Somebody be like, oh, he turned off the vignette. Now, of course,
[786.79s -> 792.36s]  the game's easier for him. All right, so let me, let me, let me go see, I want to see the DLC.
[795.16s -> 800.60s]  Yes, I've beaten this game before, but I, I came in here. Here we go. So I talked to, let's, I want
[800.60s -> 817.04s]  to see, I want to see the DLC. I didn't, I didn't do this. Oh, shut up. How come you're so orange?
[817.04s -> 832.80s]  This is a new webcam. What can Legendary Chalice be looking for all the way out here?
[835.75s -> 839.91s]  Oh gosh, Capetta, I don't know. I hope she's okay. We sure are far from home.
[844.87s -> 847.99s]  Jumping jelly beans. You boys made it. I have the most amazing news.
[848.87s -> 853.11s]  And it all has to do with these here cookies. Take a bite and see for yourselves.
[854.58s -> 871.57s]  Wow, that was probably really loud. I'm sorry. Is that that loud? I fucking hate microphones.
[873.70s -> 880.26s]  Of course, I don't hate microphones. You know, I like microphones if they're a road wireless go-to.
[882.20s -> 894.87s]  The best microphones. Is that worse noise? It might be. Whatever. All right, so for ages,
[894.87s -> 899.51s]  I've been trying to find a way to escape the astral plane, but nothing worked. Until now,
[899.51s -> 905.03s]  boys, let me introduce you to Chef Salt Baker, the greatest chef in all the land.
[905.67s -> 913.81s]  Welcome, friends. Welcome to my bakery. Oh, Miss Chalice, I see my cookie has worked wonders on
[913.81s -> 925.24s]  you. Oh, my stars. I'm a ghost again. Oh, my, a finicky thing, that cookie. The taste is sweet,
[925.24s -> 932.20s]  but the effect is brief. Fret not though, my concerned little cups. I've come up with an
[932.20s -> 938.56s]  amazing new recipe. One bite of this wonder tart and you'll have complete control over the astral
[938.56s -> 945.91s]  plane. This wonder tart could bring Chalice back to life for good. No swapping places or nothing.
[947.04s -> 951.28s]  Indeed, just one problem. The recipe requires exceptional ingredients held by the most fearsome
[951.28s -> 959.00s]  of foes. Well, if the wonder tart is what takes to bring Chalice back to life, then by golly,
[959.00s -> 972.90s]  we'll find those ingredients. This game sucks. I'm sorry. All right, fetching those ingredients.
[972.90s -> 979.20s]  Remember, like any good bake, heart and soul is a secret ingredient. Look, I'm just getting it out
[979.20s -> 991.03s]  of the way. I'm getting out of the way before I rant about game development. Okay, mad because
[991.03s -> 997.51s]  bad. Yeah, that's fine. All right, so we're just going to bring the ingredients back. All right,
[997.51s -> 1007.65s]  should I, I got to change some stuff here. Hold on. Should I try R2 for dash? I feel like that's a
[1007.65s -> 1018.76s]  good idea. R2 dash, R1 lock, switch weapon L1. Wait, switch weapon, maybe Y, the film grain,
[1018.76s -> 1024.20s]  turn off the film grain. The film, it's on every single person's stream. Nobody turned it off to
[1024.20s -> 1028.60s]  film grain. Don't make me turn off the film grain. You're going to be the only person to turn this
[1028.60s -> 1039.11s]  off. I turned off the film grain. Okay, uh, switch weapon. I'm going to say triangle. That makes more
[1039.11s -> 1050.66s]  sense than the L1, right? And then dash R2, switch weapon, triangle, EX shoot. That's fine. All
[1050.66s -> 1055.03s]  right. Let me try that and see if that's better. This is going to take a little bit of getting
[1055.03s -> 1063.92s]  used to, I think. Whatever. I'll die a few times. Turn off the screen shake. There is no screen
[1063.92s -> 1068.98s]  shake. One more thing, chaps. Remember to equip that nifty cookie charm in the menu if you want
[1068.98s -> 1078.28s]  to battle as Ms. Chalice. Oh, okay. Play as Ms. Chalice. Gain access to her double jump dash
[1078.28s -> 1091.22s]  parry an invincible roll. Um, what? Let's see how that works. I don't have any, I don't, I don't,
[1091.86s -> 1099.35s]  whatever. What's this one? Recipe for Ms. Chalice. Why are you orange? I don't know. It's his new
[1099.35s -> 1107.68s]  camera. Oh, all right. Seems like a kind of a short jump. Oh, but it's double jump parry dash.
[1112.42s -> 1122.42s]  Wait, you can jump, you can dash twice. Okay, this character is broken. This character is fucking
[1122.42s -> 1139.36s]  broken. Broken character. Broken. Okay. Dodge roll? Dude, broken character. Okay. All right,
[1139.36s -> 1161.70s]  let's go. The fuck? What does it want me to do here? Dodge roll? Oh, it's okay. Whatever. All
[1161.70s -> 1173.38s]  right, I get it. It's pretty cool. He's a journalist. All right, what's this? X-ray,
[1173.38s -> 1179.49s]  X-ray. Chef Salt Baker awarded best baker in all the lands. Boy, if you're heading down for
[1179.49s -> 1185.54s]  trouble, this aisle has got a load of it. But you sturdy pips look like you've seen the upside of
[1185.54s -> 1191.80s]  a low down brawl. But hey, here's a little tin to help you on your way anyways. Oh, all right.
[1191.80s -> 1203.43s]  Okay, use that to buy homing missiles. Let me explore. What's that? What's that? What's that?
[1203.43s -> 1209.08s]  What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? All right.
[1209.08s -> 1217.59s]  It's a really unoriginal joke and chat's going to make it worse. I don't know what I did. What
[1217.59s -> 1223.25s]  did I do wrong? An audience at last. The climbing contest medal ceremony is about to begin.
[1223.25s -> 1230.69s]  I can't believe I've won. Things are looking up. Okay. How much money do I have? Minus 200
[1230.77s -> 1239.48s]  orange. Hold on a second. I got all these like people that are screaming you dudes,
[1239.48s -> 1257.49s]  you're orange. I've just got even, I just got more orange. This doesn't feel right though.
[1260.29s -> 1276.69s]  Is that right? I feel like that's also not right. Why am I only orange and red? I look like all the
[1279.25s -> 1284.52s]  whatever. It's going to stay like this. This is fine. This is fine. This is fine. It's going to
[1284.52s -> 1292.88s]  stay like this. This is fine. All right. All the start banning complainers. You have a twilight
[1292.88s -> 1303.33s]  filter on? I don't. This is just how the camera came out of the box. Twilight filter? It is. It
[1303.33s -> 1317.28s]  is like a soft filter. What the fuck is going on? Why is it doing this? This is just how I took it
[1317.28s -> 1321.28s]  out of the box and I turned it on. I swear to you. There's nothing. I didn't turn anything on. This
[1321.28s -> 1336.44s]  is just how it came out of the box. Snapchat filter. It's new. I don't know. Whatever. All
[1336.44s -> 1341.16s]  right. What should I buy? Broken relic. A simple bobble of unknown orange. I only have five coins.
[1342.66s -> 1347.24s]  Heart ring? Gain one HP on your first, third, and sixth parry. That's actually kind of good.
[1347.24s -> 1365.65s]  Crack shot and this. All right. I don't have any money. What team? Are you team Edward?
[1365.65s -> 1373.12s]  No, I'm not team Edward and I'm not team Lucas, whatever it is. I'm team merchandise.
[1373.86s -> 1378.42s]  I'm the guy that I see what's going on here and I start designing t-shirts for the two teams
[1378.42s -> 1389.57s]  and make a trillion dollars. All right. Let's go. Gnome way out. Let's just give it a try.
[1389.57s -> 1410.39s]  Who is Lucas? I don't know. What's the other character's name? Hey, spikes. How do I get away
[1410.39s -> 1447.38s]  from that? Ow. Geese Xing. Oh, what's the special for this? The lob. I didn't even fucking come
[1447.38s -> 1454.32s]  close. All right. So this guy sucks. I haven't played cup it in six years. Okay. Relax. I haven't
[1454.32s -> 1481.09s]  played cup it in since 2016. Okay. Give her relax. I'm kind of getting used to the new controls.
[1481.73s -> 1496.56s]  What the fuck? Where do I go? Oh my God. I thought I thought it was invincible dash.
[1500.55s -> 1503.99s]  I thought it was an invincible dash. Didn't say that her dash is an invulnerable.
[1508.20s -> 1518.18s]  Oh, the role is invincible. Whatever. Start over. The role is invincible. Whatever. I
[1518.82s -> 1549.46s]  where are they going? Shut the fuck up. I'm fucking I'm so mad. I got complacent.
[1550.34s -> 1571.75s]  I can't even see. R2 is dash. R2 is dash. R2 is dash. I don't have all the items. Okay.
[1571.75s -> 1576.79s]  Like, oh, we just go suck. I don't have all the items. What? And by the way, steam cloud.
[1576.79s -> 1581.75s]  Does steam cloud only last for a year? Why is my steam cloud saved? How come my steam cloud doesn't
[1581.75s -> 1611.67s]  exist? Where is it? What the fuck just hit me? Nothing even touched me. Okay, go, go, go, go.
[1611.67s -> 1656.92s]  We're good. We're good. Phase two. Stupid. I don't think I like. I want to try. I don't
[1656.92s -> 1690.00s]  want to try this character. Different character. So much shit all over the screen. God damn it.
[1690.96s -> 1699.27s]  All right. What do I have for a move right now? I don't actually don't even know.
[1700.15s -> 1727.00s]  What's that? What does that do? What does that do? What the fuck are you talking about? What
[1727.00s -> 1780.88s]  even hit me? Oh shit. And it fucked me up. I should have invincibility frames when you do a dodge.
[1780.88s -> 1807.36s]  Perry. This is giving me an extra life. There's too much fucking shit to look at.
[1808.00s -> 1854.29s]  All right. Get out of here. Come on. Come on. Oh my God. Where am I? What the fucking ceiling hurts?
[1862.24s -> 1899.94s]  The ceiling hurts. The fucking ceiling hurts. How am I supposed to go? Excuse me. Where's the
[1900.02s -> 1951.12s]  other shit? Where are they? Oh my God. I tried to jump. This one's going to be wary of where
[1951.12s -> 1990.84s]  they're jumping out from. Come on. All right. Come on. I got three health. Let's go. And I have a
[1990.84s -> 2041.54s]  punch. All right. Quiet. I got it. What the fuck? What the heck just hit me? Bro, don't even. Let's
[2041.54s -> 2065.25s]  go. Did I get the old parries? I got how did I not get three parries? I paired three of the
[2065.25s -> 2074.47s]  what are you talking about? That's stupid. Three parries. Does that not count as a parry?
[2076.72s -> 2085.04s]  Oh, I got the gnome berries. What does that do? It doesn't count. How loud can I scream? I don't
[2085.04s -> 2096.00s]  want to do it because I have bad microphone settings. All right. That's fun. No way. Is
[2096.00s -> 2104.13s]  there anything else I can do? Can I go down? Not yet. All right. Let's do this one. Equip the
[2104.13s -> 2112.42s]  crack shot weapon. Is it better? Crack shot. Straight shot with good damage breaks into weaker
[2112.42s -> 2121.99s]  aimed projectiles. Okay, wait, super art shield pal. Someone familiar from the will take one hit
[2121.99s -> 2131.19s]  for you. I'll try. I'll do this one. Should I stay as I don't know what that does. I'll still
[2131.19s -> 2151.14s]  I'll try this for a little while. Snow cult shuffle. Let's try it. And begin. Fuck off.
[2151.14s -> 2183.99s]  I know how to switch weapons. Stop telling me. What the fuck? Okay. Um, what the hell is this
[2183.99s -> 2205.86s]  thing doing? What is the power? Excuse me. I'm going fucking what I usually do. That was should
[2205.86s -> 2264.42s]  have been dead. How? What? How did I not hurt anything? I didn't even hurt it. I don't I don't
[2264.42s -> 2296.20s]  know what this thing is doing, but it's kind of cool, I guess. All right. What the fuck is that
[2296.20s -> 2329.04s]  thing? You piece of shit. This thing does a lot of damage. So that doesn't count as a parry.
[2329.04s -> 2348.04s]  Fuck out again. That was such horse shit. And you all know it. Oh, invincibility. Yeah.
[2363.08s -> 2374.79s]  What does this do? Okay. What? I don't get it. What does that do?
[2379.65s -> 2437.08s]  Is it just vertical damage? Why would you use these? What the fuck? That stupid ass popsicle
[2437.08s -> 2467.56s]  dog shit. Like, I'm gonna come from all stage right and hit you. I want to I press B to dodge
[2467.56s -> 2482.76s]  like an idiot. What was it? It takes 10,000 hours to master something. I don't have that much time
[2482.76s -> 2500.20s]  to play cuphead. Okay. Those popsicles are dog shit. I hate them. Especially during this fight
[2500.20s -> 2503.40s]  like this. Like they just cut you can't fucking dodge them. They just What the hell?
[2552.34s -> 2555.54s]  You should be you should be invincible after you parry something for like a 10th of a second.
[2559.40s -> 2562.76s]  Shitty RNG throw fucking coins in the air and see what it lands on heads or tails.
[2563.96s -> 2645.84s]  Fucking throw coins in there. They land on tails. Oh god. What does this mean?
[2677.62s -> 2685.76s]  What the fuck? I can't hit. I can't do what the fuck was happening. I was trying to dash into
[2685.76s -> 2692.71s]  the thing and it wouldn't hit it. I put the ball out. I'm trying to dash into the ball to shoot it.
[2692.71s -> 2704.42s]  I touched it like three times. What the fuck? Why? Why? I've like, look, let me show you what
[2704.42s -> 2714.23s]  I'm trying to do. What the fuck was that? I was doing this shit. Oh, it works this time.
[2714.95s -> 2750.80s]  Piece of fucking junk. Piece of junk. Where's the second jump? Why would you launch me that high?
[2751.76s -> 2794.56s]  I'm like a ping pong. Oh my god. Shit. I hate this thing. Get this thing off. I don't want to
[2794.56s -> 2805.80s]  use this thing anymore. It like didn't shoot the little snow guy. I can't get tilted on boss two.
[2805.80s -> 2814.80s]  He's getting tilted at a children's game. All right. I'm telling you right now,
[2814.80s -> 2820.24s]  all kids would cry if they played this. You give this to a kid that under 10 years old,
[2820.24s -> 2828.82s]  they're going to cry after five to 10 minutes. They're going to cry. You want to make a kid cry?
[2828.82s -> 2834.44s]  What's wrong with you? Fucked up? What's wrong with you? What are you fucked up?
[2835.24s -> 2855.92s]  All right. Just don't get hit again. That was such a bad roll right there. There's no where I could
[2855.92s -> 2866.56s]  have gone. Heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails, tails. Oh, shit. I lose.
[2866.56s -> 2917.67s]  I lost. Oh, come on. Wait a minute. Fuck you game. That's not a damaging move. That white snow that
[2917.67s -> 2924.98s]  goes across the screen does not hurt you. Really? It's to show you that here come the spikes.
[2924.98s -> 3007.08s]  I'm trying. I've been trying to dodge that the whole time. Let's freaking go. Fuck you. So those
[3007.08s -> 3013.89s]  don't count as parries. Can you not parry actually as chalice? I do look red when I look so I go. I
[3013.89s -> 3027.54s]  look red or orange on this camera. This dude's drinking fossil fuels. I'm just drinking like
[3027.54s -> 3039.44s]  fucking oil. Let me. This doesn't look right. This looks so fucking wrong. It's only red or
[3039.44s -> 3053.70s]  orange. I'm doing every single other setting. Is that better? Maybe a little. I look really
[3053.70s -> 3069.40s]  washed out. You look really dehydrated. I don't I don't know. I think that whatever. That's fine.
[3069.40s -> 3087.84s]  I don't care. Washed up. All right. That was that was fun. What's this? Say young fry. I'm
[3087.84s -> 3095.35s]  haunt on the trail of a mystery but I'm that contest of skill that broken artifact this eerie
[3095.35s -> 3102.18s]  graveyard. I've discovered part of astral energy in all of these places. There must be an order
[3102.18s -> 3132.87s]  and method to it. Okay. One two three. One two. Nope. Nope. One two. Uh here. No. One two. Really?
[3132.87s -> 3155.54s]  I don't get it. What's the. Yeah wait. Well let me read this again. I'm hot on the trail of a mystery
[3155.54s -> 3162.92s]  but I'm stumped. That contest of skill that broken artifact this eerie graveyard. Okay. Contest of
[3162.92s -> 3167.00s]  skill. The broken artifact. One in the middle and the eerie graveyard is this whole thing.
[3167.16s -> 3179.08s]  Doesn't matter. It must be an order. How am I supposed to know this order? Yeah I don't know.
[3179.08s -> 3184.88s]  I'm just considering a guess. There's no way I could know. I'll get it. Maybe I'll do it later.
[3185.52s -> 3199.11s]  All right. This looks like a plain one. Dog on dog fight. Oh god. This already sucks.
[3205.24s -> 3207.00s]  Oh shit. Let's load up some cup head.
[3240.72s -> 3249.36s]  That's good. Just duck. That's just I don't even know that I just looked over on my right side of
[3249.36s -> 3297.32s]  the screen. That thing hurts me. How's the audio? I gotta get the super built up. All right. Phase
[3297.32s -> 3331.54s]  two. What do you got? Let's go. What the fuck? Do it. Did it hurt? What just happened? Am I hurting
[3331.54s -> 3353.78s]  him? What the fuck? Dude how am I supposed to play like this? Oh my god. Okay. That makes the first
[3353.78s -> 3409.92s]  phase nothing. All right. Come on. This one's not bad. Just get a jump. If you guys want some
[3409.92s -> 3417.12s]  some actual tips on how to play games like these. I know that I are. You suck. You should be looking
[3418.00s -> 3422.48s]  in a two to three foot radius around your character. I'm not even looking at the enemy
[3422.48s -> 3433.96s]  right now. I'm just looking at like a circle around my character. Always. Fuck. Here we go.
[3434.68s -> 3460.80s]  Ready? God damn it. God damn it. Where am I going? Oh my god. That sucks.
[3470.79s -> 3475.91s]  I'm going back. Okay. On that phase, we're going shotgun blast. Yeah. Without a doubt.
[3492.24s -> 3553.14s]  Brawl is surely brewing. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Not a big deal.
[3561.06s -> 3584.55s]  Fuck. Yeah. Oh my god. I just went the fucking my fingers. I just I hit the wrong button to
[3584.55s -> 3589.43s]  switch weapon. I've I've changed. I haven't pressed that button like an hour and 10 minutes.
[3607.17s -> 3642.24s]  I want to change this shotgun. All right. This is it. This is it. This is the one. This is the one.
[3642.24s -> 3691.65s]  Let's go. Stop being angry and play. It hurts my fucking brain. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[3692.21s -> 3712.15s]  We're good. No parries. I would be getting such great scores if these parries counted.
[3712.87s -> 3726.84s]  All right. Somebody help me here. Somebody help me. Can I not parry as Miss Chalice? Am I? You
[3726.84s -> 3734.66s]  can't. I can. Dash. But yeah. But when I dash parry, it doesn't count. Jump dash. You can't
[3734.66s -> 3741.64s]  just dash. You have to. I've done it a bunch of times. It hasn't counted. Only optional parries
[3741.64s -> 3752.58s]  count. You didn't parry. Yeah. But I mean, like the whole time I've been playing the last three
[3752.58s -> 3758.69s]  bosses, I've parried a shitload of stuff and it didn't count. I'm dashing into them and it counts
[3758.69s -> 3778.93s]  as a parry. So why is it? I don't get it. I'll prove it. They weren't optional parries. Boo.
[3779.49s -> 3785.33s]  Did I scare you? Nothing I love more than a good ghost story around the campfire.
[3788.42s -> 3796.74s]  Yeah, I had heard a word of a ghostly gal roughing up no good varmints around here.
[3799.73s -> 3808.13s]  You know what? That's been in my body for four days. I've been that I feel great right now.
[3808.69s -> 3815.11s]  You know, how many times I've gone like this, looking at like up to a light and towards like
[3815.11s -> 3817.75s]  the bright sun and stuff. We're not looking at the sun, but you know what I mean? I can't. I
[3817.75s -> 3824.00s]  haven't got that on four days. Stop talking about me. That's what that means. All right.
[3824.64s -> 3827.92s]  I'd sure love to tell the tale of the villainous veggies vanquished.
[3833.32s -> 3838.04s]  High noon hoopla. You should make chat slower.
[3839.96s -> 3842.76s]  There were 500,000 people here. How is that going to make any sense?
[3843.64s -> 3856.31s]  Okay. Listen, you know, in your school cafeteria, you know how loud it is in there? Just those
[3856.31s -> 3864.84s]  voices that are just imagine that like times 500. Of course we can't see. Of course we can't hear
[3864.84s -> 3886.56s]  anything. This is this is like 5000 school cafeterias in here. Can I shrink? No, not with
[3886.56s -> 3900.52s]  this. I thought I could. Oh, I can shrink and hit the wrong button. What the fuck is going on? Dude,
[3900.52s -> 3977.33s]  what the hell? Oh, what? Oh, the gold's coming out. What the heck? Oh, damn. This is weird.
[3984.93s -> 4096.66s]  Yeah. Oh my God. What the freak are you talking about? You have to go through the,
[4097.46s -> 4160.72s]  this one's long and this one sucks. This part is horrible.
[4208.29s -> 4222.36s]  Get out of here. I wouldn't even that fucking hard. So Perry's. All right. There we go. What
[4222.36s -> 4238.12s]  the heck? There we go. Time to pay out. Oh, you guys have been betting. Wow. Some of you
[4238.12s -> 4250.08s]  guys made out pretty good here. Desert rhymes. All right. But what about this puzzle thing?
[4250.08s -> 4278.32s]  How come I'm so white? Because I turned my white balance down because it makes me orange. Puzzle
[4278.32s -> 4290.66s]  is after the game. Oh, okay. Hey, Fusty. Thanks for the raid. Welcome, Fusty. All the raiders.
[4295.44s -> 4307.17s]  Oh, wait. No, no. Back up. Bootlegger Boogie. Why do you continue to annoy us?
[4310.50s -> 4317.76s]  Get out of here. Oh my God. I'm going to be so bad at this one. I'm so bad at
[4317.76s -> 4322.76s]  going down. It's ever since Super Mario. It doesn't matter. This is going to be horrible for me.
[4323.56s -> 4360.95s]  These explode or something. What do they do? Oh, they do explode into bugs. Whoa. You can't kill
[4360.95s -> 4378.18s]  that. What the heck? Whoa. Hello. Is that hurt? Which hurt? Which one? Which one of these hurts?
[4378.18s -> 4387.91s]  One of these hurts. Which one? Which one hurts? Bro, get out of the fucking way. Where are you
[4387.91s -> 4450.34s]  going? Where are you going? And be good. I double jumped, you dumb game. I hit X twice.
[4453.91s -> 4463.99s]  All right. This actually... Okay. Excuse me. Dude, I don't know when the fucking thing starts.
[4465.83s -> 4471.96s]  I... It's like the go up, up, up, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down,
[4471.96s -> 4488.15s]  down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down. I hate falling
[4488.15s -> 4493.51s]  through floors in games. I hate it. It's so annoying. I hate the fall through the floor mechanic.
[4494.53s -> 4566.16s]  I am so bad at it. Oh, shut up. I hate it. No. Yes. Uh-oh. Oh, come on. Mid animation.
[4569.30s -> 4617.86s]  What is he doing? Oh, God. What do I have to hit? Hey. Got it.
[4624.31s -> 4646.16s]  Fuck that. Now, I don't stop playing this game until I get to this screen a lot of times, guys.
[4646.16s -> 4661.68s]  In no way. I don't. Nope. Not going to fucking do that. We did it. That was the last ingredient
[4661.68s -> 4685.62s]  we needed for the wonder tart. Let's get back to... Did I beat it? Did I beat the DLC? Did I do it?
[4685.62s -> 4700.20s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to do this. Ladder and... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
[4700.76s -> 4716.23s]  So I should do that first? If I go in there, am I going to end it? Ladder. Oh, okay. The king's leap.
[4723.16s -> 4734.34s]  What? Hail ye cups, I bid thee welcome to my floating palace. I am the one true king,
[4734.34s -> 4741.48s]  the king of games. From afar, I've seen you battle with zeal and aplomb, and though I grant
[4741.48s -> 4747.16s]  thee a place in my royal tourney, and these bouts, your weapons and charms shan't be of use,
[4747.96s -> 4755.28s]  you'll have to find different means to best my champions. From victories, riches,
[4755.28s -> 4759.76s]  now into the frie... So I can't use any of my items? How did I get all that on my finger?
[4760.32s -> 4763.12s]  How did I get all that on my finger? I didn't even do anything. What just happened?
[4763.68s -> 4780.53s]  I don't know how I did that. Okay, so... Oh, I can't, I can't shoot anything?
[4783.51s -> 4790.88s]  Okay, so just dot parry. Well, never mind. All right, I get it.
[4819.96s -> 4834.76s]  Okay, so that was like a little tutorial. Wealth untold. One, two, two coins. All right.
[4835.73s -> 4844.68s]  The next match. Whoa, all right, let's go. What's this one?
[4851.17s -> 4861.88s]  I can't shoot. I got the stupid grease all over my hands and it's everywhere. It's all over the
[4861.88s -> 4886.34s]  controller. Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it. Oh, I'm gonna get so greedy here.
[4890.10s -> 4943.78s]  Oh, God. Shut up. I'm so impatient. Oh, shut up.
[4952.07s -> 4954.07s]  That hitbox makes a lot of sense. Fix it.
[4977.41s -> 4982.31s]  That's when he goes, when he goes like, look, he does that.
[4982.47s -> 5053.28s]  That was almost perfect. I'm just getting so lazy and greedy. Stop being greedy and stop being lazy.
[5088.26s -> 5091.78s]  I have the same problem with Dark Souls bosses, man. I just want to get in there and just start
[5091.78s -> 5099.14s]  punching and slashing. I don't want to wait for you to go here. No, just, I want to just punch,
[5099.14s -> 5173.73s]  punch, punch, punch, punch. That's an opportunity. Oh, greed. Come on, dude. Stop. Okay. All right.
[5173.73s -> 5188.00s]  That's not so bad. Once you get a hold of it. Okay, more coins. I actually really need these.
[5188.64s -> 5215.60s]  Did I do it? Is that it? Is there more? Oh, there are more ladders. Okay. New challenger lies beyond
[5215.60s -> 5235.60s]  the door. Still dodges. Yep. Do I have to put these out or I'm gonna put them out. Oh, God.
[5235.60s -> 5255.60s]  All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. You just spawned on top of me. All right. But if I was
[5255.60s -> 5308.28s]  doing fine, I was doing fine. Followed me all the way back over here. What the fuck? Oh, stop. What
[5308.28s -> 5324.08s]  was that? Dude, what the hell was that? Do you eat peanut butter out of the jar with your fingers?
[5327.76s -> 5375.84s]  No. Do you? I was, I was drooling. It was, it just wasn't moving.
[5376.16s -> 5430.84s]  Oh, stop doing the fucking daffy duck. Get out of here. All right. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yep. Hold on.
[5437.67s -> 5465.52s]  All right. More money. Cool. How many of these are there? I haven't blinked in, I think,
[5465.52s -> 5490.15s]  over an hour and a half. Launch them back. Yeah. Okay. All right. I get it. Come on.
[5492.04s -> 5518.71s]  Oh, this shit's coming out of the bottom. Dude, stop shooting that. I was trying to be fucking
[5518.71s -> 5590.60s]  cheeky. What? No, go this way, bro. There it is. All right. More money.
[5599.49s -> 5611.89s]  That's a different door. Stop being good at this game. Again, I need to make sure everyone's very
[5611.89s -> 5618.52s]  aware of this because it's very important that I continue to prove this. If the game has two to
[5618.52s -> 5631.86s]  three moves, I will fucking dominate it. Jump, dash, shoot. That's it. I will absolutely destroy
[5631.86s -> 5640.56s]  that game if there's two moves. If the move is jump and shoot, I'm going to do very well. I'm
[5640.56s -> 5646.23s]  very simple, right? I'm very simple. But with the simple shit, I can do it pretty well. Just like
[5646.23s -> 5654.96s]  dodging an axe. Not that hard. It's just move out of the way of the axe. I think I would be very
[5654.96s -> 5661.41s]  good at it. You know what? Honestly, you know those rooms with the lasers that all the spy movies
[5661.41s -> 5666.87s]  where they go in? Watch out for the lasers. I would be that person in the heist. The person that you
[5666.87s -> 5672.95s]  send in to make sure they don't touch the lasers. That's it. My only job is to don't get touched by
[5672.95s -> 5719.75s]  this thing. It won't touch me. It just will not. Oh, this is cool. Oh, I ran out of juice.
[5737.67s -> 5745.30s]  You ran into a stationary microphone. I wasn't trying to dodge the microphone. See, that's where
[5745.30s -> 5751.86s]  your logic is flawed here. If somebody picked up the microphone stand with the microphone and
[5751.86s -> 5759.65s]  threw it as a javelin at me, it would be yank. It would not touch me. I wasn't dodging it. I was
[5759.65s -> 5771.14s]  unaware of its existence. Three coins. Tournament has concluded. Henceforth, my castle shall remain
[5771.14s -> 5781.17s]  a training ground for thee. Fare thee well, champions. That's cool. And there are more little
[5781.17s -> 5795.78s]  kind of hidden secret little things like that. So how can I do that? Can I turn the fire on?
[5798.76s -> 5827.27s]  Do the puzzle. How? Should I know it at this point? I can't believe I've won. Things are looking up.
[5827.27s -> 5834.39s]  Second place just ain't right. Down one place from last year. It ain't right. I trained too hard only
[5834.39s -> 5848.37s]  to come in third. Wait, things are looking up. So what middle first row middle just ain't right.
[5848.93s -> 5863.46s]  Down one place. So down right. So middle, top right most. It ain't right. And then right.
[5864.18s -> 5889.41s]  So it's middle, right, right, or middle, right, left. No, what the fuck was it? Not right. Yeah.
[5889.41s -> 5920.08s]  Okay, so hold on. Hold on. I can't believe I've won. Things are looking up. Second place
[5920.08s -> 5941.59s]  just ain't right. Down one from last year. How do I look at it? Up, down, left, left.
[5947.68s -> 5958.42s]  No help. No help. How come I can't touch the middle one? Why can I touch the middle one?
[5964.10s -> 5985.46s]  Give me the answer. I don't know. I don't care. I just want the answer. That's not right.
[6026.64s -> 6063.44s]  Use the relic? How do I use the relic? It's equipped. It's not right. Top, middle, middle,
[6063.44s -> 6069.44s]  left, middle, right. That's what I just did. Wait, top, left, middle. What did you say?
[6075.97s -> 6082.45s]  Wait, they can be on the same row? That's right. Oh shit. Hold on. Oh, they can be on the same.
[6082.45s -> 6091.99s]  All right. Hold on a minute. Upper, bottom, middle, left. Thanks. Appreciate it. Think of it as a
[6091.99s -> 6104.74s]  numpad. Someone just give me the answer right now. Give me the answer. Give me the answer.
[6104.74s -> 6126.92s]  Give me the answer. Give me the answer. Up your ass. Give me the answer. Top, middle, down, right,
[6126.92s -> 6149.48s]  right. Thank you. I didn't know. I did. Whatever. I thought you were smart. Well,
[6150.84s -> 6156.74s]  before I do this, let me just say one thing. Yeah, I played Diablo Immortal. I don't recommend it.
[6156.74s -> 6161.46s]  Don't play it. It's really not good. Don't play it. There's no reason to download it.
[6161.46s -> 6170.02s]  But I got to the section where there's nine torches, and you have to light all the nine
[6170.02s -> 6180.92s]  torches. I couldn't do it. It was a simple puzzle. When you turn this torch off, the ones next to
[6180.92s -> 6187.99s]  it will turn on. I sat there for probably one full hour trying to do it. I couldn't do it.
[6187.99s -> 6193.76s]  I can't do that kind of shit. We've got a raid from Joel. What's up, Joel? I hope you're doing
[6193.76s -> 6198.82s]  well. Welcome, everybody. Welcome to the stream. Currently at the, I think, one of the last things
[6198.82s -> 6202.50s]  in the Cuphead DLC, and I've only been streaming for an hour and 45 minutes. I thought this was
[6202.50s -> 6208.63s]  going to take me all day. I thought this was going to take all day, but thanks for the raid, man.
[6208.63s -> 6223.06s]  Hope you're doing good. Okay, well, that hurts. All right. You have the capacity of somebody with
[6223.06s -> 6233.97s]  a squashed head. How did I get hit by something already before the fucking cut scene? All right,
[6233.97s -> 6241.70s]  this one doesn't fuck around. All right. That's the lightning from under the cloud. Of course.
[6242.66s -> 6301.43s]  I can refund it. No, why would I? It's fun. What's happening? Am I winning?
[6303.19s -> 6330.04s]  Am I beating them? I don't know. Did I win? Holy shit. Could it be the fabled cursed relic long
[6330.04s -> 6337.00s]  thought lost of time awoken at last? I've seen writing that say despises bravery. For the greater
[6337.00s -> 6346.32s]  foe more evil shall go. What could it mean? What does that mean? Jinxed curio that inflicts various
[6346.32s -> 6356.84s]  status ailments. Does it make it hard mode? I don't get it. It just went random. How did I
[6356.84s -> 6370.56s]  brute force that? Don't equip that. Yeah, I'll keep it un-equipped. It makes the game really hard.
[6376.02s -> 6385.97s]  I have money. Hold on. What should I get? Full screen piercing three-way shot. Whoa.
[6389.48s -> 6392.60s]  Foe interest. Fake phony interest. Foe interest for the YouTube video. Foe interest.
[6397.27s -> 6412.47s]  Ooh, I like, let me try this. Roundabout. Should I try it? I don't want that. I mean, just buy them.
[6412.47s -> 6425.51s]  Why not? I'll try it. I'll have to do the recipe, right? Well, let me do that first. I'll keep what
[6425.51s -> 6452.92s]  I have. Uh-oh. Here it comes. Welcome back, you meddlesome brats. I didn't think you'd be back so
[6452.92s -> 6458.20s]  soon. No matter. It's too late to stop me now. The wonder tart will be my finest work yet.
[6458.68s -> 6466.64s]  Ah, shame I never told you about the most important secret ingredient. Coffee. Oh,
[6466.64s -> 6470.64s]  I thought we were coffee cups. Whatever. A living soul. While you suckers were out
[6470.64s -> 6476.12s]  doing my bidding, I nabbed your little friend here. When his soul is baked into the wonder tart,
[6476.12s -> 6483.06s]  the cosmic powers of the astral plane will be mine. Mugman, Ms. Chalice, it gotta help me.
[6483.78s -> 6487.35s]  But first, I'll take those ingredients and then I'll use your heads as serving dishes.
[6492.20s -> 6533.36s]  Oh, my God. That's fucking scary. All right. That hurt. What? Run that all the way back. I dodged it.
[6543.52s -> 6578.36s]  Oh, my God. My eyes. Oh, my God. This is so brutal. All right. What's phase two?
[6578.36s -> 6612.05s]  God, here he goes. Oh, shit. What do I have to hit? Oh, my God. All right. All right. All right.
[6612.05s -> 6632.40s]  Okay, I got it. I got it. This is really cool. Use the new gun. Oh, yeah. I kind of like this one.
[6637.32s -> 6658.40s]  There are bugs in my hair for all so long. No, I didn't want to do that. I didn't want to
[6659.04s -> 6680.52s]  do that. Bad RNG. Dirty streaming. No, I'm not. I'm very clean. I'm incredibly clean.
[6684.82s -> 6688.82s]  I'm very clean. Don't ever say that again or you're going to get timed up for a fucking whole day.
[6712.10s -> 6734.13s]  Let's go. All right. Now I know what to do. Oh, my God.
[6735.01s -> 6780.05s]  Whoa. Where to? What's going on? What the fuck?
[6792.15s -> 6813.94s]  And bugs in my hair. God damn it. I'm so actually mad. This one's the best one so far.
[6814.66s -> 6823.32s]  I like the first boss and this boss the best. If this is the end of the DLC, which we'll find out
[6823.32s -> 6890.32s]  very shortly. Let's go. All right. Don't get hit here. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
[6890.32s -> 6915.41s]  Let's go. When do I use it? God, how are you supposed to not get hit by that? I pressed
[6915.41s -> 6934.44s]  it twice. Should I not even fight? Or is this him? I'm so confused. Oh, my goodness. Don't die.
[6938.05s -> 6965.06s]  There it is. All right. Hell yeah. Let's take an A. You didn't do every parry. No, I didn't. Cuphead.
[6971.06s -> 6979.70s]  Thank goodness you're okay. That dastardly salt baker. He had us hoodwinked the whole time.
[6980.74s -> 6985.86s]  Yeah, Zoogs, this place is coming down. Let's get out of here.
[6995.91s -> 7009.52s]  I didn't press A. No, my bakery serves him right for duping us. But with the bakery destroyed,
[7009.52s -> 7014.90s]  you're never going to get that wonder tart, Chalice. That's okay. If some poor soul has to
[7014.90s -> 7020.92s]  be sacrificed for me to live again, it just ain't worth it. But mark my words, boys. I'm never going
[7020.92s -> 7027.43s]  to stop searching. And in the meantime, if you ever find yourselves in a scrap, just one cookie
[7027.43s -> 7035.22s]  bite away. Besides, who needs a wonder tart when they can have a two new best pals instead?
[7035.94s -> 7043.52s]  Oh, hold on. Well, I didn't beat the game.
[7053.08s -> 7066.32s]  Did I? I'm not done streaming. We're still going. I kind of maybe I'll just keep playing this for a
[7066.32s -> 7085.14s]  little bit because I want to try the other items. Is there any more? That's in? Okay. Try them on
[7085.22s -> 7096.74s]  expert mode. Yeah, I'll try a few. Yeah, I really completely underestimated how hard that was going
[7096.74s -> 7106.08s]  to be for me. I was thinking, man, this is probably going to be at least an eight hour
[7106.08s -> 7120.18s]  experience of me playing this. You mean overestimated? You know, the right one,
[7120.18s -> 7124.90s]  whatever the one that's the right one. The one where I think I'm going to be worse than I am.
[7125.70s -> 7141.20s]  Our sincere appreciation to the members of our team whose loyalty and creative endeavor
[7141.20s -> 7168.84s]  made possible this production. So do you want me to keep playing? I'm still here. I want to just
[7168.84s -> 7177.28s]  play. Maybe try the expert stuff. And then maybe I want to try the other items. Dude, if I'm never
[7177.28s -> 7189.41s]  going to play this game ever again, then I might as well do a little bit right now. What I think I
[7189.41s -> 7199.48s]  really. All right. So here's the here's the plan for the rest of the day. I think as long as we do
[7199.48s -> 7204.36s]  that, there'll be enough time later in the stream to be able to add some more stuff at the end,
[7204.36s -> 7213.40s]  maybe do a little bit of just chill, chill. And then we can maybe do some tomorrow.
[7216.18s -> 7234.00s]  Wicked funny. Can you slow it down? I don't think so. That was a pretty cool ending.
[7251.59s -> 7258.58s]  Forty four percent of the DLC. How's it make any sense? All right. I want to let me see
[7259.14s -> 7266.63s]  because I want to try the new weapons. I'm not just going to converge and twist up and then
[7267.59s -> 7278.82s]  what's this one? Oh, Perry for HP. Let me try these new moves. OK, this is no way out. Expert
[7278.82s -> 7288.84s]  mode. It's right. It's got the expert. Oh, it's like kind of a spreader. This one's weird.
[7289.72s -> 7298.00s]  How do you how do you make how do you utilize this one? Honest to God, how do you utilize that?
[7298.00s -> 7311.17s]  This one's not bad to point it to point it down. Oh, I get it. Does this do enough damage to
[7311.33s -> 7318.21s]  justify using it, though? It's kind of weird. It's weird to use. Does it do a lot of damage?
[7318.93s -> 7335.62s]  It sucks. It kind of does. All right, let me try that one. Do the secret phase and the dog boss.
[7336.77s -> 7342.74s]  This one's not bad. I'll do spread for that. Actually, maybe I should try that. Yeah,
[7342.74s -> 7382.23s]  let's try that crack shots. Best weapon in the game. Oh, it went up. What the heck?
[7394.18s -> 7434.05s]  Oh, I like that. Good weapon for this one. Hey, oh, let's try it again.
[7435.49s -> 7439.49s]  Actually, I didn't like this boss. It was too kind of too random, too random shit going on.
[7467.70s -> 7502.63s]  Come on. This thing doesn't hurt him. Where's the damage? Oh, it does that too. All right,
[7502.63s -> 7529.20s]  come on, let's go. What's this last phase? I forget. All right, this shit. All right. Oh,
[7529.20s -> 7536.04s]  I didn't want to press that. That's fucking I hate this boss. This boss is just like this random
[7536.04s -> 7541.96s]  shit flying in every direction. All right, what about another one? What's the secret phase?
[7542.60s -> 7564.60s]  How do I do the secret phase? Change weapons in the death screen. How does that work?
[7566.26s -> 7599.96s]  Don't kill any ads on the second phase. Okay, don't kill. Okay, cool. That's right. That was
[7599.96s -> 7671.11s]  such shit RNG. This weapon's kind of annoying. All right, don't kill the dogs. What? Okay,
[7671.11s -> 7740.42s]  don't kill the dogs. You idiot. Did you? I'm just getting lazy. I already beat this dumb,
[7741.14s -> 7788.45s]  stupid boss. Shoot. What do you mean shoot? Shoot them. I thought you said don't attack. Don't
[7788.45s -> 7806.42s]  hurt them. Don't kill them or something. How much do I have to hurt them? What's going on? How do
[7806.42s -> 7835.49s]  I do this? What's happening? You have to do it until they have gray smoke. All right,
[7835.89s -> 7842.92s]  afterwards I want to do something stupid. Let's fuck with new people that come in.
[7845.14s -> 7848.74s]  I'm going to put a death counter on the screen. It's going to be like 600 something
[7849.30s -> 7863.52s]  on a boss and I'm going to be sitting there like crying. Can one of the mods set up like a command
[7864.16s -> 7871.84s]  and add like 630 deaths already so then when I die you can do like exclamation point death and
[7871.84s -> 7883.51s]  it adds 631. All right, all right, all right. Smoking. That one's smoking. They're all smoking.
[7883.51s -> 7899.40s]  They're already smoking. All of them are smoking already. Okay, that one's smoking, smoking,
[7899.96s -> 7940.84s]  smoking, smoking. Now what? Great. Nice work. Shut up. I got out of the way. Please.
[7943.72s -> 7998.69s]  Whatever. 631. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to get like into character here.
[7998.69s -> 8005.06s]  And the thing is like, let's make it so what a dummy, right? I'm going to use shit that I
[8005.06s -> 8009.83s]  shouldn't even be using. What's something that somebody would be like? Wow, this guy's a fucking
[8009.83s -> 8017.86s]  noob. Like the extra hit point, right? But I'm a new and I don't understand that what parries are.
[8017.86s -> 8033.08s]  Okay. All right. So wait, let me, let me go down here. Use the charm. No, no, I want it to be.
[8033.08s -> 8044.69s]  All right, here we go. Ready? And I'm going to individually press the button to shoot.
[8056.23s -> 8068.95s]  Fuck. How do you stand still? All right. This is hold the button down. This is games. It's not for
[8068.95s -> 8086.90s]  me. I just really, I don't think the game's for me, but I'm going to try and I'll do some
[8086.90s -> 8163.59s]  mods. Keep track of it. Whatever. Fucking hate. It's so stupid. Fuck. I don't fucking, I don't
[8163.59s -> 8168.39s]  understand why people fucking play this game. I don't, I don't, I just don't get it. I don't
[8168.39s -> 8172.79s]  fucking get it. I don't fucking get it. I don't give a people play this. Why would you play this
[8172.79s -> 8179.38s]  game? Take a break. I'm not taking a fucking break. Stop saying it. Stop telling me that I've been
[8179.38s -> 8196.48s]  streaming for like two or three hours. You can hold to fire. I, I like to shoot losing viewers.
[8198.80s -> 8207.51s]  I don't fucking care. Why do, and again, why did people say play this and play the DLC?
[8207.51s -> 8212.72s]  That's what I don't fucking understand that this community sometimes I don't play hard. You guys
[8212.72s -> 8215.68s]  told me this wasn't a hard, this is not supposed to be a hard game. Why tell me to do this?
[8216.87s -> 8221.01s]  Why tell me to play this game? It's, I thought it was like a fun cartoon game.
[8221.01s -> 8225.52s]  You're just bad. So actually mods actually start fucking banning people. It's really actually
[8225.52s -> 8238.80s]  really fucking annoying. Is it four more? Get the auto-aim weapon. Crying Andy, crying Andy.
[8244.53s -> 8256.44s]  Where, where is it? Take a break. It sucks so fucking bad when I look over here and I see
[8256.44s -> 8277.80s]  that I've died 600 fucking times. Somebody said to die 600 times in two hours. It's not even
[8277.80s -> 8287.14s]  possible. It takes, all right, hold on. How long does it take to die? Let's see. How long does it
[8287.14s -> 8296.16s]  take to die? Count. Ready? This is not even possible. Ready? One, two, three, four, five,
[8296.72s -> 8305.04s]  six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. All right. Let's just benefit the doubt. It takes 10 seconds
[8305.04s -> 8320.20s]  to die, right? 10 seconds to die. How many? 10 seconds times 636 divided by 60. All right. So if
[8320.20s -> 8330.48s]  I die every 10 seconds, that means I have to die every 20 seconds for this to make any sense.
[8332.29s -> 8337.73s]  At that point, man, you don't even play. Why are you here? If you're dying every 20 seconds,
[8339.08s -> 8353.48s]  it's possible to do that. That would be so painful. That would actually be painful. 20
[8353.48s -> 8360.04s]  seconds every time. That means the stream turns on. There's no intro. I just start walking into
[8360.04s -> 8371.97s]  depth, walking into traps and walking into people's... There's no intro. All right. So what
[8371.97s -> 8387.78s]  should I do now? Any of the games I should play today? 600. I don't think I died even half that
[8387.78s -> 8396.92s]  amount of times in the base game. Let me take it to the other side. Hold on. Let me go off the DLC
[8396.92s -> 8419.04s]  island. Play Tarkov. Dude, I'm not playing Tarkov. Okay. Wait a minute. What's this? I didn't do this
[8419.04s -> 8433.57s]  one. Did I? Oh, wait. Oh, dude. Tarkov. Is it weird that I think Tarkov is a game that I want to
[8433.57s -> 8456.95s]  read the manual for? Like the shit that comes in the disk box. Play Morrowind? I'm not gonna play
[8456.95s -> 8471.20s]  Tarkov. That's 30% of games. Go back to Miku? I uninstalled Miku because I never thought I was
[8471.20s -> 8478.56s]  gonna play it ever again. You hear what I'm saying? I uninstalled it. I didn't think I was gonna ever
[8478.56s -> 8494.31s]  play it. Chills. Well, reinstall it. Is that what you guys want? All right. This has to be unanimous.
[8495.56s -> 8501.81s]  This has to be completely unanimous. Do you want me to play that Miku rhythm game? This has to be
[8502.53s -> 8533.51s]  80%. Yes. 80%. Oh, no. I've been exposed. You died 79 times. Hey, like five of those would just be
[8533.51s -> 8541.70s]  fucking around. So it's like 70. I want to let me do some running gun. All right. What do we got?
[8541.70s -> 8550.07s]  Play Miku. Let's get on. I'm hating these levels with a passion. I'm so you know what? I'm actually
[8550.07s -> 8577.92s]  kind of glad none of these were in the DLC. I genuinely hated these. Oh, yeah. What is it at?
[8577.92s -> 8604.13s]  Is it even remotely close? I wanted to dash through it, not into it. I'm screwed here.
[8605.33s -> 8643.59s]  This weapon is so good. Oh, what? What do we got? That's not even. That's not close, guys. That's
[8643.59s -> 8655.81s]  not close. 58%. Way too many of you don't want that. I'm not playing Tarkov, but why? I need a
[8655.81s -> 8661.73s]  guide to play Tarkov. There's only one way I'll ever play Tarkov. It's like if a Tarkov streamer
[8661.73s -> 8666.61s]  or somebody that knows Tarkov is like, Hey, dude, I can teach you Tarkov. You can walk behind me.
[8666.61s -> 8670.13s]  And it'd be like, you'd literally just walk behind me and I'll do everything.
[8671.41s -> 8687.00s]  But it's not gonna happen. I'm not playing Tarkov. Democracy is dead. No, what? This wasn't a
[8687.00s -> 8693.80s]  democracy. This was a goal you had to reach. That didn't say this was a democracy. I said,
[8693.80s -> 8698.29s]  get it to 80% or it's not happening. If I can hit one more time by one of these star guys,
[8698.29s -> 8727.97s]  I'm gonna punch him in the fucking mouth. Play Isaac? I got a list of stuff I'm gonna jump into.
[8727.97s -> 8772.63s]  I figured out. Wobble dogs? No, I'm good. No. Stop it. Noita? That's a- I've not heard that in a
[8772.63s -> 8824.61s]  while. What are you doing? I hate this level. Let's go. What about more demos? Do some more
[8824.61s -> 8840.88s]  YouTube zoomer humor videos. Morrowind? You don't want me to play Morrowind. It's gonna take us like
[8840.88s -> 8851.09s]  three hours to get to the first island. All right, get Morrowind to 80% and I'll download it right
[8851.09s -> 8876.98s]  now. No, I'll make it easier. Get Morrowind to 70%. Jumbo rebound. Everyone's gonna leave when I
[8876.98s -> 8880.74s]  play Morrowind. We're gonna sit there and just listen to dialogue and opening cutscenes and I'm
[8880.74s -> 8886.10s]  gonna kill the first NPC I see and have to restart the game save file. That's- that- there you go.
[8886.10s -> 8895.41s]  I just streamed it. I just did it. I don't even need to do it. I just streamed it. What is this
[8895.41s -> 8913.92s]  one? Oh, this was in the base game. Oh, I remember this one. This is the dragon one.
[8916.74s -> 8942.12s]  This match will get red. Can I charge even more than that? No. What was that?
[8942.84s -> 8981.25s]  It's just like a- a pup. Uh-oh. Don't these guys jump? Yeah, they do. Well, you don't think I
[8981.25s -> 8992.40s]  fucking knew that? I'm getting real sick of the back seating. You didn't get it to 70%.
[8993.28s -> 9014.69s]  You didn't make it. You didn't make- you didn't make it to 70%. What do you mean riot? Recount.
[9014.69s -> 9049.70s]  What do you mean riot? No, you- I said 70%. I made it easy. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. That tail
[9049.70s -> 9118.32s]  should be removed from the game. Where the fuck am I? Play Peglin? No! We want RollerCoaster
[9118.32s -> 9142.20s]  Tycoon 3. You're the only one that's written that in the last hour. Oh, by the way, if you have a
[9142.20s -> 9149.01s]  green screen submission- oh, something else I wanted to bring up too. So a lot of people that
[9149.01s -> 9156.07s]  might be new viewers might not know that- that tail. A lot of new viewers might not know the- the
[9156.07s -> 9161.75s]  green screen stream from a couple days ago. We've done that two other times. So there are three
[9161.75s -> 9167.27s]  full green screen streams. So don't- you can use them all. Don't be afraid to use them all.
[9167.99s -> 9171.68s]  I think a lot of people might think that that was- oh, wow, that was- you just did that for
[9171.68s -> 9175.52s]  the first time. Nope, that's the third time we've done that in the last three, four years.
[9176.40s -> 9188.98s]  So use all the footage you have until the 18th at 12.01 midnight. 12.01 midnight on the 18th.
[9190.13s -> 9197.44s]  That's July 17th, very late at night, to submit your video. There are rules. Please read the rules
[9197.44s -> 9201.68s]  that are in the Discord, the channel. There will be a form for you to fill out.
[9202.40s -> 9205.92s]  Please do all the rules, otherwise you're going to be in big trouble.
[9206.72s -> 9228.34s]  That- this- that sucks. That just sucks. This is base game. We're just like kind of playing for
[9228.98s -> 9232.74s]  that. That sucks. That's a dumb mechanic.
[9241.12s -> 9246.32s]  Play Cruelty Squad? I don't think I can play Cruelty Squad, guys. I looked at the trailer
[9246.32s -> 9251.86s]  and I wanted to puke. I'm sure the game is fucking phenomenal, but it kind of hurts my head.
[9252.82s -> 9283.28s]  Play Breath of the Wild? I would rather play Morrowind- Mora- I can't talk. I would rather
[9283.28s -> 9287.20s]  play Morrowind than Breath of the Wild. Is that bad? Is that going to make anybody angry?
[9301.78s -> 9306.50s]  Just right now, I want to play Morrowind, not Breath of the Wild, but I don't want to play Morrowind.
[9307.14s -> 9320.61s]  I hope that makes sense. I hate this boss. This boss is stupid.
[9322.85s -> 9331.88s]  I beat this four years ago and I think I said that. The phase three when the little
[9331.88s -> 9334.20s]  thing comes out and you- I don't know if I'm going to hit it or not.
[9345.57s -> 9358.80s]  You know, I'm not- I'm not paying attention. That's the problem. I beat the DLC in like 60
[9358.80s -> 9364.29s]  deaths. Don't ever forget that. I'm just like shit. I'm just shitting here. I'm just talking.
[9364.29s -> 9374.84s]  I'm not even playing. Play Morrowind? All right, we have to get you guys to like 70%.
[9376.04s -> 9388.48s]  Do something else? I'll do something else after this. I have to beat this guy just because I'm
[9388.48s -> 9390.88s]  going to be so pissed off for the rest of the day if I don't kill this thing.
[9391.60s -> 9407.30s]  Like, this is going to ruin my day if I don't kill this guy. It's going to ruin my whole day.
[9409.30s -> 9416.18s]  More attempts on a boss that I beat fucking five years ago than the entirety of the DLC.
[9424.45s -> 9431.73s]  How are you supposed- What are you supposed- How am I supposed to fucking fight this with-
[9431.73s -> 9474.90s]  I gotta change weapons. Like, Jesus. That fucking tail. This is not even hard. I just don't care.
[9474.90s -> 9482.56s]  Oh my god. I'm so- I don't even care. Like, why do I have to- I don't have to beat this.
[9483.12s -> 9487.12s]  This guy's not even hard. I just don't even care. I have to kill this thing.
[9491.14s -> 9519.56s]  This dumbass shit boss from 2016. I hate this fucking boss. He's so slow and this- the stupid
[9519.56s -> 9525.91s]  moving platforms. I don't even need to beat this. Why am I even here? I beat this guy on expert
[9525.91s -> 9564.84s]  already in front of you all. Why the fuck do I care? He has to die. These weapons suck.
[9565.88s -> 9576.85s]  I don't care. Why am I doing this? I don't have to do this. I just beat the fucking DLC.
[9576.85s -> 9613.76s]  What am I doing here? I can't take it anymore. This weapon sucks. I'm gonna freak out.
[9614.96s -> 9623.41s]  Does anyone think it's funny that I'm getting more annoyed and upset at the fucking base game
[9623.41s -> 9629.01s]  which I've already beaten after dominating the DLC? Does anyone else think that's funny?
[9629.09s -> 9637.96s]  Does anyone else think that's humorous? Because I do. I'm getting more annoyed at a boss from
[9637.96s -> 9657.59s]  the base game. It's so easy to fucking fall down when you do that shit. This is my last
[9657.59s -> 9699.62s]  try and I'm gonna fucking smash my monitor with a hammer. Doesn't own a hammer? Yes I do. I own
[9699.62s -> 9705.30s]  a mini hammer. That's all you need. You don't need these huge hammers. Stop talking. You're
[9705.30s -> 9761.03s]  gonna make me mad. These weapons are so bad for this. Oh my god. I don't- I forgot- I forgot
[9761.11s -> 9769.88s]  I did that. Why do I care? I can't fucking stop guys. I don't know why I need to beat this stupid
[9769.88s -> 9776.12s]  boss. I've beaten this so many times. Why do I care? By the way I have a mini hammer. It's like
[9776.12s -> 9780.55s]  this big. That's all. You don't need anything bigger than that. Well you're not strong enough
[9780.55s -> 9788.40s]  to swing a hammer a little extra. It fits in way more places. You don't need a huge ass hammer.
[9788.40s -> 9807.80s]  You just need one of the little ones. Dude I actually have spent more time on this than any
[9807.80s -> 9821.80s]  of the DLC bosses. Put up that 600 deaths thing again. It's just the last phase is just unbearable.
[9822.60s -> 9827.20s]  It's so easy but it's- that makes it so hard because he just shoots this- shut up.
[9860.90s -> 9880.29s]  You can't even attack him with that- I can't attack him. Oh my god it just auto attacks the
[9880.29s -> 9895.00s]  fucking stupid flaming orbs. I beat the fucking secret boss first try in the DLC.
[9895.64s -> 9941.22s]  Look at mod chat. Don't distract me right now. I'm trying to get over this dumb thing I'm doing.
[9941.22s -> 9962.68s]  I'm just trying to get over playing this stupid game. I have to get over it. Should we post the
[9962.68s -> 10034.39s]  rules? Yeah. What if I died? All right fuck this game. Stupid ass game. I don't give a shit.
[10035.27s -> 10047.32s]  All right why is this breaking apart in my mouth? Okay I'm fine. I don't even know why I did that.
[10047.32s -> 10052.36s]  There was no reason to do that. I beat that boss like five different times over the last five years.
[10053.24s -> 10064.31s]  All right so what are we doing? Morrowind? What's happening? Yeah the rule- you can post the rules.
[10064.31s -> 10081.86s]  Dick fart. That was a mod that said that by the way just so you know. Morrowind? Copium? Should I
[10081.86s -> 10089.40s]  just play Morrowind? Should I just go for it? I don't even think I own Morrowind. Do I own Morrowind?
[10089.40s -> 10096.05s]  Does Morrowind even run on Windows 10? Whatever the hell I have.
