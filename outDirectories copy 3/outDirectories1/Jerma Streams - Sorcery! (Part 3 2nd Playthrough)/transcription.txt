[2.55s -> 11.45s]  Hey Fred. Hey Fred. What's up? How you doing? You doing good? How you been? You've been good?
[11.45s -> 23.77s]  Hey dude, can you play Elden Ring? I already beat Elden Ring. That was good. I know I said I was
[23.77s -> 33.26s]  going to do something else with Elden Ring, but I didn't do it. Me strong let's play did not happen.
[41.99s -> 47.08s]  Yeah, what is it? They have to, there's no way the DLC does not get announced
[47.08s -> 54.07s]  in the next few months, right? They definitely have DLC that's planned for next year,
[54.07s -> 61.96s]  right? Like 2023. It has to be. It has to be. How long did it take from Dark Souls 3,
[62.84s -> 73.34s]  from launch to the first DLC? A year? Year and a half? When are you going to do the axe
[73.34s -> 92.14s]  self-defense class? Play Lost Ark. Hey, can you start being EU friendly for streams? I don't
[92.14s -> 96.62s]  live in the EU, but I get up before the sun, so can you change your whole schedule to benefit me?
[103.06s -> 112.06s]  No, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry about that. Hey, can you do EU streams? I don't live in the EU,
[112.06s -> 122.84s]  but do it anyways. All right, we got some stuff to talk about. Things to go over. First of all,
[122.84s -> 134.57s]  let's go over what's going on this week. Okay, stop. This week, today, we got sorcery. Tomorrow,
[134.57s -> 141.05s]  probably sorcery. Thursday, hmm, something, something happening. Something happening on
[141.05s -> 147.05s]  Thursday. I won't tell you what, but I think something's going on on Thursday. You might
[147.05s -> 160.26s]  find very interesting. We'll see. We'll see. I'm very excited for it. We'll see. And then Saturday,
[160.26s -> 171.91s]  I'm going to tell you right now, Saturday is the day for Green Screen Part 2. I don't know
[171.91s -> 186.86s]  if I can even talk. Hold on, let me see. Yeah, okay. So it is happening on Thursday. I'll let
[186.86s -> 190.70s]  you know maybe in a little bit, because I don't know if it's been talked about yet.
[191.42s -> 207.37s]  So maybe. Maybe I'll talk about it. Is it a poetry night? No. Yeah, so let me tell you that I've been
[207.37s -> 213.62s]  feeling a little under the weather in a colitis flare. I'm having problems once a year or so.
[213.62s -> 219.78s]  This happens. It comes back maybe a couple times a year. And I don't feel fantastic. I don't feel
[219.78s -> 226.10s]  great. So we're going to do more streams this week, but less time. So we'll do like three or
[226.10s -> 232.18s]  four hours today, three or four hours tomorrow, however long the thing on Thursday is. And then
[232.18s -> 237.30s]  obviously the Green Screen movie night will be about four-ish, five-ish hours. So we'll do more
[237.30s -> 247.03s]  days, but less time this week. So we'll do about three days in a row here and then Saturday. So
[247.03s -> 260.47s]  should be good. Now where? Oh, where did this go? There. All right. So we left off in sorcery.
[263.74s -> 271.75s]  It's 11 p.m. here. I mean, hey, when you spin, the globe is big and the globe has lots of time
[271.75s -> 290.10s]  zones on it. 11 p.m. Where are you in? Germany? Green Screen movie night part two will be Saturday.
[290.66s -> 298.18s]  And we're going to do it Saturday night. Saturday night. Saturday at like 4 p.m. 5 p.m. Pacific.
[298.18s -> 307.32s]  Saturday night. Very cool. Very cool. Very cool. Very cool. Very cool. All right. You guys ready?
[307.96s -> 312.42s]  Shall we continue our story? It's been like a week, so let's refresh people what we're doing.
[312.98s -> 319.56s]  Where we were. Some things we did. I'll put the camera on. I hope it's not.
[321.08s -> 331.78s]  Hey, it's not. All right. Good. All right. So we left off. We were here at the halls of Vlada.
[331.78s -> 336.60s]  We still have the ape as the god. We'll give you a little look at where we were. Remember, we were
[336.60s -> 343.70s]  in this house here. We got chased through the alleys. We went across the document where I was
[343.70s -> 350.94s]  in the water. I almost drowned three times. Remember before that, we were through here
[350.94s -> 358.58s]  in the artist's quarter. The giant stomped on that guy's carpet stall and I burnt the whole
[358.58s -> 364.60s]  place down, I think. And then we rewound and I did it normally. Would you ever try psychedelics? No.
[364.60s -> 376.38s]  No, I'm too fucked up already. Like I've had this conversation about drugs before. I'm not. I don't
[376.38s -> 385.18s]  condone drugs like that. I can't do them. I would never do them. I would never try them. Ever. No
[385.18s -> 391.70s]  way. Too much. Way too much. And I think it is too much, right? You know, if you smoke marijuana,
[391.70s -> 398.63s]  you know, you have a few beers, right? Cool. But like, it's too much after that. Anything
[398.63s -> 417.18s]  after that's too much. At least that's my opinion on the whole thing. Remember, nobody believes you.
[417.18s -> 423.10s]  That's fine. I don't need to prove to anybody that I don't do crack. All I can tell you is,
[423.10s -> 429.26s]  guys, I don't do crack. I don't believe you. I don't care. That's fine. I don't care. I don't
[429.26s -> 434.95s]  give a shit if you don't believe me that I don't do crack. I don't have to like get on stage in
[434.95s -> 440.20s]  front of 20, 30,000 people and sit there and go, guys, I don't do crack. I promise. They're just
[440.20s -> 447.30s]  booing. Boo, you fucking liar. I just have to sit there and go, that's fine. You are free to believe
[447.30s -> 454.71s]  whatever you want. That's the whole show and then the curtain comes down. All right. So here we are
[454.71s -> 460.31s]  now. This is what it looks like. We're going down here. We're trying to get the poem for the door.
[460.31s -> 465.91s]  I'll show you the clues, which by the way, you can't even hear anything, but now you can.
[465.99s -> 474.22s]  Let's open up the, let's take a look what we got. Let's get that music going. All right. So we have
[474.22s -> 481.14s]  a lot of beeswax, a skull cap, two doses of blimberry juice, a bamboo flute, eight goblin
[481.14s -> 485.30s]  teeth, a giant's tooth, green haired wig, bracelet, a bone and a sun jewel. We've got a lot of items.
[485.30s -> 501.34s]  I still have my standard sword and here are the clues. North spell gate. Remember the North gate
[501.34s -> 506.06s]  requires a spell made of four lines. Without the lines, you will not be able to leave the city port.
[506.70s -> 521.59s]  The fifth noble, Shinva. Lord Shinva is the fifth noble. Korga. Remember this?
[522.23s -> 526.26s]  The ritual of Korga involves his three eyes, the left eye, right eye and the third eye.
[526.26s -> 534.49s]  I don't get a puke. If you don't, okay. I got it. Let me give a refresher on sorcery. Sorcery is a
[534.49s -> 545.18s]  choose your own adventure game. It's back in like the 1960s, 1970s by Steve Jackson. It is a fantastic
[545.18s -> 549.26s]  experience. One of the greatest, one of my favorite games of all time. We're doing it again because I
[549.26s -> 555.16s]  passed a million followers. So where are we going? Are we going to go through the arch? Are we going
[555.16s -> 562.94s]  to go to the halls of Vlada or are we going to go to the left port? It's up to you. Remember the game
[562.94s -> 567.18s]  is from 2013. Yes, and it's the first game that I streamed on Twitch. I passed a million followers,
[567.18s -> 581.03s]  so we're doing it again. This I believe is the gambling hall. The last thing we did was the
[581.03s -> 586.06s]  statue. I think I can show you. You go over to the statue, look at the pot, it seems to contain 20
[586.06s -> 593.46s]  gold pieces. We didn't take any money from this. People wanted me to, but I said no. I said no.
[596.25s -> 605.75s]  Keep rubbing it in my face that you had a million followers. Well, what do you mean?
[607.03s -> 616.18s]  That's what I'm doing. All right, let's get a poll. Any mods around or should I hop in the
[616.18s -> 628.73s]  chat and do it? I can hop in the chat and do it if I need to. Would you ever do an IRL gambling
[628.73s -> 643.54s]  stream while I'm doing a poll? All right, so we're going to go. This is one, two and three.
[643.54s -> 659.72s]  Keep that in mind. One, two and three. Here we go. Oh, a poll is already active. Oh, shit.
[659.72s -> 667.64s]  You didn't say no. I, whatever. I didn't say anything. You said that. I didn't say shit.
[667.64s -> 678.52s]  Remember one, two and three. Through the arch. One. The halls of Vlada. Two. The left fork.
[689.90s -> 702.33s]  And we are going to two. Here we go. Oh, do I still have my voices? Let's see. Does this work?
[702.33s -> 734.39s]  Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work.

[824.33s -> 861.46s]  Work. Work. Work. Work. Work.
[861.46s -> 866.46s]  And a bristly innkeeper are waiting to play.
[866.46s -> 873.36s]  We went all in. Oops.
[873.46s -> 875.12s]  Alright, so let's look at the tables.
[875.12s -> 877.36s]  First of all, oh how? What's going on here.
[877.36s -> 885.33s]  Crazy
[885.33s -> 889.29s]  The tables are arranged in different sections by the size of the bet and the number of dice to be played
[889.65s -> 894.34s]  Sad looking creatures move down from high stakes tables to lower ones
[894.76s -> 896.94s]  Brassy and bold creatures move up
[896.94s -> 900.44s]  At the two chip tables are the old man in the sailor
[900.44s -> 904.30s]  At the table with the ten chip bet, the innkeeper is waiting to play
[904.30s -> 907.03s]  The old man in the sailor have just finished a game
[907.03s -> 908.37s]  The old man must have won
[908.37s -> 913.36s]  because he stands, cracks his knuckles, and moves to the five-piece table.
[913.36s -> 917.04s]  The sailor ships down to the table with the five-chip wager.
[917.04s -> 922.31s]  It's the same innkeeper? Um, I don't know, it might be.
[927.88s -> 929.12s]  Cash out.
[929.12s -> 930.84s]  All right, that was fun.
[930.84s -> 933.32s]  I've, I've moved him around in my hands for a few minutes.
[933.32s -> 936.04s]  I'm out of here.
[936.04s -> 940.39s]  Uh, let's just, hold on, let's wait and watch.
[940.39s -> 942.64s]  You sit back and watch for a while.
[942.64s -> 945.44s]  The players on the tables form themselves into pairs,
[945.44s -> 948.16s]  and settle down to play in deathly silence.
[948.16s -> 953.51s]  The rattle of dice fills the hall like a clash of swords in a barrack room.
[953.51s -> 957.72s]  Nearby, on the five-stake table, the old man and the sailor finish a tens game.
[957.72s -> 960.68s]  Sailor must have won because he stands up, barks a laugh,
[960.68s -> 963.24s]  and moves to the table with the ten-chip stake.
[963.24s -> 965.88s]  The old man shifts down to the cheap table.
[965.88s -> 970.00s]  How many chips does the old man have?
[970.00s -> 972.68s]  I feel like this is a fucking math question in a math book.
[972.68s -> 979.16s]  How many chips did the old man come in with?
[979.16s -> 982.44s]  Okay, uh, the spin lady leaves the booth at the front of the hall
[982.44s -> 984.82s]  and makes a circuit of the room,
[984.82s -> 987.38s]  offering refreshments at the cost of four gambling chips.
[987.38s -> 995.94s]  The burly innkeeper buys two rolled-up flatbreads and devours them without looking.
[995.94s -> 1001.24s]  That's four gold.
[1001.24s -> 1003.01s]  All right, I'll do it.
[1003.01s -> 1006.13s]  You buy a hill fox thigh and eat it quickly.
[1006.77s -> 1011.32s]  Someone curses from the back of the hall, but no one seems to notice.
[1011.32s -> 1012.60s]  All right, let's, should I pick a table?
[1012.60s -> 1014.48s]  Are we going to the big bet?
[1014.48s -> 1016.24s]  Or what, what are we doing for bets?
[1016.24s -> 1018.80s]  Should I just keep waiting?
[1018.80s -> 1021.54s]  Maybe, maybe a fight will break out.
[1021.54s -> 1024.58s]  Should I just cash out after watching the fight?
[1024.58s -> 1025.46s]  It's gonna be a fight, right?
[1025.46s -> 1027.60s]  It has to be.
[1027.60s -> 1030.10s]  You stand back and watch the players.
[1030.10s -> 1031.78s]  Over on the tables with the 10 chip bet,
[1031.78s -> 1033.78s]  the sailor and the innkeeper have played each other.
[1033.78s -> 1039.00s]  The sailor shifts down to the medium table.
[1039.00s -> 1044.31s]  All right, all right, pick a table.
[1044.31s -> 1047.84s]  At one end, games are being played for stakes as low as two.
[1047.84s -> 1051.52s]  Uh, at the other end, players are betting 20 on each game.
[1052.40s -> 1056.34s]  Most tables also offer long games with four or five dice each,
[1056.34s -> 1058.74s]  alongside shorter two or three dice games.
[1058.74s -> 1061.81s]  But not all the tables have players ready to play.
[1061.81s -> 1063.43s]  You look across the tables.
[1063.43s -> 1065.67s]  At the table with the two chip wagers, the old man.
[1065.67s -> 1069.19s]  At the five piece table, the sailor.
[1069.19s -> 1071.91s]  And at the other side is the 10 chip with the innkeeper.
[1071.91s -> 1077.33s]  I, all right, are we doing long 10 short two or short five?
[1078.05s -> 1083.16s]  I mean, I took 28 chips, 27 chips.
[1083.16s -> 1083.88s]  We gotta go 10.
[1084.52s -> 1089.00s]  It's the same guy.
[1089.00s -> 1090.60s]  You take a seat across from the innkeeper,
[1090.60s -> 1093.24s]  who you do not recognize from your travels through the city.
[1093.24s -> 1094.79s]  Okay, different person.
[1094.79s -> 1096.55s]  Let's make this quick, he says,
[1096.55s -> 1099.91s]  his nervous eyes giving the lie to his weary smile.
[1099.91s -> 1102.60s]  The innkeeper counts up five dice each and waves you to bed.
[1102.60s -> 1104.04s]  Here we go, swindle stones.
[1104.04s -> 1118.80s]  How about we lead at one, two ones.
[1118.80s -> 1127.19s]  Let's just fuck with them.
[1127.19s -> 1128.47s]  Three threes.
[1131.04s -> 1135.52s]  Three threes.
[1136.08s -> 1142.85s]  So I got one, four threes.
[1146.53s -> 1152.87s]  Call, oh, oh, did I get swindled?
[1152.87s -> 1153.51s]  What?
[1153.51s -> 1156.32s]  All right, I got swindled.
[1156.32s -> 1157.20s]  It's okay, it's all right.
[1157.20s -> 1158.32s]  It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
[1158.32s -> 1159.28s]  All right, this guy's a good player.
[1159.28s -> 1160.00s]  This guy's a good player.
[1160.00s -> 1160.80s]  I got it, I got it.
[1160.80s -> 1164.79s]  Are you staying in Kare for long?
[1164.79s -> 1166.34s]  Two fours.
[1172.34s -> 1174.50s]  Shit, he started, okay, what about twos?
[1174.50s -> 1176.90s]  I have one two, he might have a two.
[1179.70s -> 1183.27s]  This is a bad start because I have one.
[1183.27s -> 1191.73s]  I'm going to say three threes.
[1191.73s -> 1192.53s]  Call it, that's fine.
[1192.53s -> 1194.61s]  There's no way you don't have one three out of you.
[1194.61s -> 1195.65s]  You got five there, right?
[1195.65s -> 1198.04s]  Holy shit, what?
[1198.52s -> 1202.39s]  There's nothing I could do there.
[1202.39s -> 1217.43s]  I'm actually in trouble now.
[1217.43s -> 1222.45s]  Two threes.
[1222.45s -> 1226.42s]  Say three threes and let me win this.
[1226.42s -> 1227.86s]  There we go, there we go.
[1227.86s -> 1228.74s]  All right, let's go for it.
[1228.74s -> 1230.02s]  There's no way, call that.
[1230.02s -> 1233.99s]  There it is.
[1233.99s -> 1240.60s]  We're coming back, we're coming back.
[1240.60s -> 1242.60s]  Oh, this is huge, this is a huge deal.
[1242.60s -> 1245.62s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[1245.62s -> 1246.42s]  Oh, that you think they're.
[1246.42s -> 1248.26s]  Oh yeah, you're already saying there's one.
[1248.26s -> 1254.92s]  Why don't I just go this fucking four, right?
[1255.80s -> 1256.92s]  Do you think he'll call this?
[1256.92s -> 1259.09s]  If I say there are three or should I go there?
[1259.09s -> 1260.13s]  Should I say there are four?
[1260.13s -> 1262.79s]  You think he probably has one, right?
[1262.79s -> 1270.72s]  He's going to call this and he's going to lose.
[1270.72s -> 1273.49s]  Call it, call it.
[1273.49s -> 1273.73s]  What?
[1279.03s -> 1279.51s]  No way.
[1280.07s -> 1290.74s]  So one, two, three, four, he must have at least two.
[1290.74s -> 1297.36s]  Shit, you have to call it.
[1297.36s -> 1298.40s]  I can't do it for you.
[1298.40s -> 1304.88s]  Call him on it, but he's probably going to have two.
[1304.88s -> 1306.56s]  Oh my God, I could have said six.
[1306.80s -> 1314.62s]  I should I was gonna say six. I could have done six. I was gonna do six. You saw me do it. Come on
[1314.90s -> 1328.50s]  There are two twos. Okay, call that shit. That means you have to have three. Fuck you. You don't have three
[1328.54s -> 1345.50s]  What the fuck this guy's getting insane hands. It's stupid. It's actually not fair. I have one of those two
[1345.50s -> 1361.06s]  Oh fuck off again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again
[1361.06s -> 1377.66s]  He got three insane hands in a row. I got so screwed. I really did. All right, let's start with one two two fours
[1378.16s -> 1395.80s]  Okay, let's do three fours. Call it four fours. Okay, five fours. Do you think he has two?
[1395.96s -> 1419.72s]  He's gonna call it and I'm gonna lose because that said we both have two then let's do it
[1419.76s -> 1435.36s]  Don't call it and actually might have got him. That means he has to have three. Let's call it. Just zap him
[1435.44s -> 1439.18s]  No, I can't just kill everybody. I have to be I have to win
[1439.98s -> 1448.60s]  Diplomatically, whatever this is. Listen, you couldn't let me win. Could you? Why we start at three?
[1448.66s -> 1455.94s]  Why are we starting at three? Oh, he started at two. What are you doing? Three ones?
[1455.94s -> 1479.24s]  He definitely has at least one one call it brief. Okay, so that means I have one don't call it shit
[1479.24s -> 1488.22s]  Okay, but does he have a do you have four fours? No, you don't. All right, we're getting that money back
[1493.89s -> 1502.20s]  Okay, so we're gonna do open with what do I not have right? Okay, so let's do one
[1502.20s -> 1510.15s]  I'll start with one the two two
[1510.71s -> 1526.98s]  Two threes two fours, okay three ones. He's definitely has him on
[1526.98s -> 1538.11s]  I wonder what he has I'm gonna say four cuz he might he probably has two
[1538.15s -> 1549.24s]  Well, okay, that's that would be an insane hand if he had if he had three fours, which would be ridiculous
[1549.28s -> 1562.11s]  And he does nope. Oh, thank God. Okay, I got it. So you've been to Vlada before no, you're a regular
[1562.11s -> 1571.29s]  I guess he only has two dice. So that's one three. Okay, so let's say
[1571.83s -> 1587.93s]  There are two threes which makes it physically impossible you have lost the game is over well one more round
[1587.93s -> 1596.78s]  But it's it's almost it's almost a 98% chance that he loses. Okay, so I got a one
[1598.10s -> 1599.22s]  one
[1599.22s -> 1607.39s]  one five two threes three threes
[1607.39s -> 1620.49s]  I have one he probably had no I have two four. Yeah. Sorry buddy. That's not possible you lose
[1623.81s -> 1629.77s]  All right with a hearty laugh the innkeeper hands over ten chips you now have 24
[1629.77s -> 1645.53s]  All right, I'm back to where I was I have I'm back to my where I started with change table in the hall
[1645.73s -> 1669.99s]  More food and snacks the sailor buys a snack pick an opponent. I play the sailor. I'm gonna play the sailor
[1669.99s -> 1683.10s]  This is for five. I think right. Oh, this is a this is a short game tips use hat puffs his pipe. Yoy
[1683.80s -> 1685.52s]  Ain't good
[1685.52s -> 1692.51s]  What you join the swarthy sailor at the table? He tipped his hat to you and puffs his pipe. You ain't good
[1692.79s -> 1708.05s]  He asks you merely nod and reply. Okay. What did he say? Let's start. Alright, so I got two
[1708.77s -> 1728.19s]  Two twos. Okay, really that means you might you must be well, let's say three then call it
[1728.33s -> 1751.08s]  Okay, do we both have to that's the call. Yeah, you're full of shit. God damn it. We both had to that's unlucky
[1751.32s -> 1768.24s]  Yo, ain't lot the car. Oh suck. You're in like car. Oh suck. I don't know one three
[1768.24s -> 1785.54s]  I mean, this would be accurate. So let's see if he does three. Okay, there's no do you do you seriously have to again?
[1786.33s -> 1796.27s]  Bullshit. Yeah, okay back to even start with
[1797.71s -> 1813.00s]  One one three two threes. Okay, that's your full shit. You had to have had him both cuz I'm a liar
[1813.14s -> 1830.34s]  I'm a liar. What are you gonna go with one five two fives? Oh, sorry for that's impossible
[1830.34s -> 1832.34s]  I take your money
[1832.50s -> 1843.36s]  Continue you take his last die away winning the game with a frown the sailor hands over five chips
[1843.58s -> 1847.48s]  You now have 29 he gets up and swearing colorfully
[1847.48s -> 1853.14s]  He marched out of the hall to find something to drink now
[1853.14s -> 1854.26s]  Let's go play the old man
[1854.26s -> 1866.07s]  Pious looking monk steps into the hall looks about and then sits down at the ten chip table a creature with only one eye gets
[1866.49s -> 1871.98s]  Sobbing and runs out of the hall. It seems it has lost the other eye in a bet
[1872.16s -> 1878.16s]  Let's watch once again you spectate in the corner of the room
[1878.16s -> 1881.30s]  You notice a gnome who rushes in through a crack in the wall
[1881.48s -> 1884.88s]  Steals something from one player's pocket that is gone again
[1885.72s -> 1889.88s]  Nearby on the tables with a ten chip bet the innkeeper and the monk have just finished a game
[1889.88s -> 1894.45s]  The innkeeper shifts down to the five-stake table follow the gnome
[1897.12s -> 1908.04s]  Should we go after the gnome? I think we run after the gnome. Why not? What are these?
[1908.04s -> 1913.57s]  We don't know what he stole you dash after the gnome curious to see what he has stolen
[1913.57s -> 1919.10s]  The crack in the ball leads to a path that heads out through a wasted area of fallen down buildings
[1919.18s -> 1927.90s]  You lose sight of the gnome amongst the rubble what? Oh, I'm fucking dead
[1928.02s -> 1936.35s]  This is a narrow dirt track that dodges around piles of rubble on either side of the street
[1936.47s -> 1941.74s]  Looks as though a gigantic boulder has rolled down the path crushing everything in its wake
[1941.96s -> 1947.09s]  Even the pebbles underfoot have been ground to a fine dust. There's no sign of the gnome at all
[1947.11s -> 1956.52s]  A few blueberries grow by the side of the track look at the berry plant kneeling down by the plant
[1956.60s -> 1960.94s]  You look more closely at the blueberries. They seem perfectly ripe and glisten with juiciness
[1961.26s -> 1969.50s]  But you do not recognize them smell it you lean in close and take a deep breath from the plant
[1969.50s -> 1975.20s]  They smell sweet and rich and quite enticing pick a handful
[1975.20s -> 1981.46s]  You gather a handful of berries a few are squashed in your palm as you pick them coating your hand with a dark blue juice
[1981.98s -> 1986.58s]  Taste them you shove a handful of berries into your mouth
[1986.68s -> 1990.07s]  The taste is sweet almost sickly a moment later
[1990.07s -> 1994.15s]  That is exactly how you feel and you look down to see your hands are turning blue
[1994.23s -> 1998.02s]  Your breath is short in your lungs. You are suffocating from the inside out
[2007.63s -> 2014.17s]  Thinking quickly you stick your fingers down your throat causing yourself to be violently ill you make a terrible blue mess all over the ground
[2014.21s -> 2018.99s]  But at least you can breathe again you gather your strength then get back to your feet
[2018.99s -> 2027.80s]  You leave the deadly berries and move along. How do I I got a cat? How do I cash out?
[2027.90s -> 2044.08s]  I have chips. Do I how many chips do I have? I don't have any money. I have 29 gambling chips
[2049.38s -> 2063.88s]  Maybe I could maybe I can cash them in go back and rewind. How many do I have left? 29
[2064.82s -> 2073.83s]  Cryptocurrencies the gnome berry wasn't worth it rewind. How many do I have to?
[2080.76s -> 2101.00s]  I don't know. Okay, I'll rewind so it was not here. It was here not the track
[2101.00s -> 2113.66s]  It was right after this right here, right? All right, I'll use it
[2113.66s -> 2122.52s]  I'll use it cuz I have to catch I can't just drive 30 gold. All right, I'm gonna I'm gonna cash out
[2122.52s -> 2136.68s]  I've got 29 chips or should I just play against the old play the monk pick an opponent
[2136.68s -> 2142.83s]  The monk seems to be on a winning streak. All right, we're gonna play the monk
[2142.83s -> 2154.06s]  The monk hands you your dice and waves you to bid. Oh, it's a two game. That's it. Oh, oh
[2154.66s -> 2163.10s]  I think we just start right off with two right cuz then he'll be like, oh shit
[2163.10s -> 2167.64s]  Do I just start right off with two ones?
[2167.64s -> 2178.84s]  I should just do one one if I do one one then he says two ones then he's gonna be like hey
[2178.84s -> 2196.87s]  I got a one or do one like one five or someone three. I'll do one one two
[2199.60s -> 2221.16s]  Call that that means no wait. That's a lie. It wasn't a lie one one two ones. I got a one two, buddy
[2221.16s -> 2231.60s]  Oh, that's the game you lose
[2232.76s -> 2257.88s]  Furious you gift you remain at the table. No five. All right, this is dead. This was better
[2257.90s -> 2270.09s]  This is easier win. Look at this. I got three here. Let's just start with it. Let's start with like two
[2270.61s -> 2277.19s]  Something I don't have let's go fucking three three twos
[2277.19s -> 2291.41s]  You know what I mean? Three three twos four twos like you have three of them idiot
[2291.41s -> 2329.45s]  You have to have you have to have like there's no way right? There's no way that you have three again
[2329.47s -> 2335.59s]  No, there's no way. Yeah, that's not gonna say it. I get twice in a row get out of here
[2335.77s -> 2342.03s]  My ten gold maybe
[2342.31s -> 2354.99s]  All right, good start. Let's go with like one five one four
[2354.99s -> 2364.47s]  I always can't see that as five because of regular dice two fives. Okay, well three ones call it
[2364.47s -> 2367.23s]  There's no way what an idiot what a bad play that was. Okay, four ones
[2367.39s -> 2382.16s]  You might have five ones. You definitely have two ones. You would not have bet that if you didn't yeah
[2382.84s -> 2397.06s]  I've always wanted to come here. This is where the best players in Kari come to play. That's right
[2397.06s -> 2404.80s]  You're looking at one right now. Okay, I've got let's go with let's do something
[2404.82s -> 2423.56s]  Wacky here. Yeah, two ones two threes three threes call it call it four. Oh
[2424.12s -> 2440.02s]  Really? No, you don't. Mmm
[2440.20s -> 2450.91s]  two fours
[2450.91s -> 2459.32s]  Three four. All right, so you probably you have three fours. Wait, don't call that
[2462.40s -> 2475.24s]  You're gonna have two aren't you? Yes, I win. So what do you she got two to one dice left, right?
[2475.24s -> 2494.25s]  How many does she have left that two? Okay, so one two two twos three twos. It's got played actually a good
[2494.25s -> 2504.02s]  I almost got in trouble there. Uh, there is one
[2504.58s -> 2506.58s]  There with his one
[2506.62s -> 2523.13s]  One one two ones done. All right, we're back to even with a frown the beggar girl hands over ten chips enough
[2523.13s -> 2535.23s]  Twenty nine. All right. All right, let's get out of here cash out
[2535.23s -> 2539.07s]  You had enough of your turn to cash your chips at the booth. Yeah cash out. I'm done
[2539.07s -> 2546.31s]  I made five dollars twenty nine gold pieces. I see you've come out a winner reply with a smile
[2546.39s -> 2555.78s]  You had one coin profit. No, I bought food in there. Okay, here we go
[2555.88s -> 2567.61s]  So plenty of ground to cover. All right, we're gonna go up or down. Well, by the way, this is up. This is oh so daisy
[2570.62s -> 2587.08s]  Where am I? I didn't mean it up. Okay
[2588.36s -> 2600.73s]  Up or down down takes us through here. This this is down down here up heads through this square
[2600.73s -> 2604.36s]  We were here before we were here before
[2604.76s -> 2609.26s]  We were this is where we were and then we could have gone up through this square
[2609.42s -> 2614.26s]  But we were up here before although we might be able to go through a different alley here
[2614.26s -> 2627.43s]  Then we're gonna go up or down. That is what the pole is up or down. I'll give you a big view
[2627.43s -> 2632.38s]  this is what you can look forward to going this way or
[2633.57s -> 2638.33s]  potentially this way few places to go looks we can go like this or
[2640.30s -> 2642.30s]  like this or
[2644.38s -> 2648.40s]  This if I go follow that gnome again or this
[2649.06s -> 2651.62s]  But that's not part of your choice
[2655.96s -> 2657.96s]  It's close, but it's not too close. So
[2657.96s -> 2673.47s]  Okay
[2673.47s -> 2680.25s]  All right, that's pretty that's pretty much it 70% say go down. So we're gonna go down. Thank you for voting
[2682.46s -> 2687.90s]  Okay, you fall. Whoa, that's a lot you follow the road
[2688.50s -> 2693.22s]  Around the side of the gambling hall to a wide open space laid out for a market
[2693.42s -> 2699.66s]  There are several stalls all selling the same goods. They're traders arguing loudly over who has the cheapest or best quality
[2701.61s -> 2703.49s]  provisions weapons
[2703.49s -> 2706.33s]  useful gear magic items the well
[2706.93s -> 2710.69s]  Okay. Well, I got I got money so we need to buy food. It's important
[2714.06s -> 2719.62s]  Browsing the stalls you find that food is reasonably expensive with the cheapest provisions being sold at three gold pieces each
[2719.82s -> 2731.07s]  One trader is also selling a wrap package of six meals for 15 gold. What's that come out to be? That's a great deal
[2731.27s -> 2742.59s]  That's a really good deal save like three gold, right?
[2742.87s -> 2752.00s]  But I don't but what if I run out of money don't buy food you turn the trader
[2752.24s -> 2756.12s]  Down the trader and move through the market. I think I can come back. Let me see what else is here
[2756.12s -> 2762.83s]  Let's browse the weapons take a turn about the armorer stalls
[2763.21s -> 2767.21s]  Mostly what is on sale is of poor quality or weaker than the blade you carry already
[2767.33s -> 2774.08s]  but two things catch your eye a hefty broadsword with a good solid grip and a bow with a quiver of
[2774.16s -> 2780.92s]  Silver tipped arrows a bow you lift the bow and test the string
[2781.04s -> 2784.82s]  It seems firm and responsive and although you have little use for ranged weapons
[2785.14s -> 2789.62s]  This one seems hardy enough the quiver is interesting it contains ten arrows
[2789.90s -> 2797.29s]  But each has a tip made not of steel but pure silver the armorer nods at you significantly as you discover this
[2797.53s -> 2801.51s]  Well, you know what?
[2801.51s -> 2804.52s]  No, the dead
[2805.08s -> 2809.54s]  Only silver can pierce the hearts of the dead and he adds in a whisper
[2810.04s -> 2815.28s]  six gold pieces I mean
[2816.85s -> 2823.88s]  Silver arrows, I'm buying it. I'd like the bow you tell the armorer
[2824.18s -> 2830.14s]  He makes a great fuss of packaging it up, but eventually hands over the bow in the quiver you pay him six gold pieces
[2830.86s -> 2836.16s]  Okay, what about the broadsword?
[2836.28s -> 2840.78s]  You look the broadsword and move your microphone up a little closer to your face
[2840.94s -> 2846.29s]  So you get that more podcast style storytelling voice perfectly balanced
[2847.35s -> 2850.65s]  Who's the sword maker not an antique either but made of brand new?
[2853.64s -> 2866.58s]  Eight gold pieces. Yeah, okay. I don't need it eight gold. No, thanks. That's too much
[2866.70s -> 2876.72s]  I'm moving on you found a clue. Oh cuz the silver shit do I lose my opportunity to buy food
[2880.77s -> 2883.02s]  It's okay. I've already eaten. All right
[2883.02s -> 2891.95s]  We're gonna browse magic items you scour the market for items that might be useful to you in magic
[2891.95s -> 2899.56s]  But find nothing except for one jeweler's stand which in amongst a lot of very expensive and overpriced jewelry is offering a sun jewel
[2899.64s -> 2903.64s]  For sale the exorbitant price of 15 gold. I already have a sun jewel
[2903.64s -> 2912.72s]  I already got it the trader's sun jewel is as beautiful as your own perhaps even slightly more polished
[2912.72s -> 2916.99s]  I don't need it now
[2917.23s -> 2929.49s]  Fuck off you point out the jewel a nice piece
[2929.49s -> 2936.29s]  But a fake in lower car a these cost ten I'll give you ten a nice piece
[2936.29s -> 2946.26s]  But a fake wait cuz I have one that's a fake the jeweler laughs softly and pointedly removes the jewel from your hands
[2946.50s -> 2949.31s]  It most certainly is not fake
[2949.63s -> 2955.88s]  But if you cannot see that then I do not think you are the correct buyer for this exquisite piece
[2956.12s -> 2960.63s]  You take one last look at the Sun Jewel sigh and leave it walking back into the market
[2963.13s -> 2976.50s]  Mine is fake is mine the fake you browse around stall selling useful gear and items for travelers and crump across tooth ring
[2976.82s -> 2978.30s]  You know, they look useful
[2978.30s -> 2980.94s]  The first thing is a tinder box for lighting fires
[2981.30s -> 2990.30s]  Though it will not work without tinder and the second is a bottle of snake bite antidote the tinder box costs two and the antidote
[2990.30s -> 3002.37s]  Three I'll take them both you pay five gold pieces take both items you thank the trader and move off into the market
[3002.53s -> 3019.06s]  All right. I got a ton of stuff. You're definitely gonna get bitten by a snake at some point. Yeah, I got a snake antidote. Okay
[3020.18s -> 3026.79s]  So we can go down or it's giving us the opportunity to go up again
[3027.31s -> 3038.60s]  But you guys did not choose up you chose down so we're going to continue to go down that that is what that was decided
[3039.04s -> 3042.48s]  You guys did not say down then up you said down
[3043.08s -> 3050.78s]  By the well beyond the market is a street of tall iron fenced houses
[3050.90s -> 3057.64s]  You're entering a rich district built in relative safety close to the wall on the highest point of land in the city
[3057.72s -> 3061.62s]  Few creatures live here and it would seem that beggars are not tolerated
[3061.94s -> 3069.45s]  The streets are empty and for the first time clean you pass a well with a pulley attachment built above it
[3069.45s -> 3079.69s]  But no rope you flick a coin into the well and wait for several seconds before you hear the plop as it hits the water
[3079.77s -> 3089.78s]  The well is clearly very deep suddenly from below you hear a woman's voice singing throw down one more coin for me
[3089.98s -> 3108.14s]  Two wishes will I grant for thee throw a fucking fireball in the well? Oh, wait a minute. Okay read minds
[3108.82s -> 3118.06s]  God this dump dump
[3118.70s -> 3124.38s]  That would be insane. Imagine that like I'll throw another coin down for me. Hey, hey, you can take the whole crate
[3124.94s -> 3127.62s]  That's funny. All right, you can do that
[3128.93s -> 3134.77s]  Mud create quit when I'm gonna fill the well with quicksand and like drown the lady
[3135.45s -> 3143.82s]  protect from magic
[3143.82s -> 3148.26s]  Throw down another coin for me one more for a wish for thee
[3148.82s -> 3155.11s]  Yeah, back it up right here back. Yeah now pour the cement in there
[3156.33s -> 3158.33s]  mmm
[3159.25s -> 3168.56s]  That's fucked up. Um, I don't know what to do. These are all kind of funny. I mean sauce makes sense
[3169.08s -> 3178.30s]  Dodd is funny too. Let's do dud
[3179.02s -> 3186.95s]  Cast the spell creating a mountain of gold and treasure would you tip into the well piece by piece?
[3187.67s -> 3189.98s]  The voice inside begins to sing
[3190.74s -> 3197.53s]  Deliriously giddy with excitement at so much wealth after a few minutes of this a hatch opens in the side of the well house
[3197.85s -> 3202.18s]  Which you had not noticed before a tiny gnome clamors out
[3202.26s -> 3208.89s]  he reaches down into the well unclips a rope from one side and attaches it to the pulley and then begins to haul up the
[3208.89s -> 3213.02s]  bucket, uh
[3213.02s -> 3220.39s]  What are you doing you demand but the gnome appears not to notice you it seems he is blind and maybe deaf as well
[3220.51s -> 3225.22s]  He continues to wind the pulley until the bucket reaches the surface of the well
[3225.30s -> 3228.55s]  All the water inside has drained away through holes in the base
[3228.75s -> 3234.85s]  There's a gold piece the gnome tips these out the gnome tips these out into a pouch
[3239.85s -> 3245.66s]  What's in the pouch though, right?
[3245.66s -> 3258.01s]  This is the same gnome that was stealing shit from the casino has to be it's gonna be probably ten twenty gold in there
[3258.01s -> 3269.26s]  Or do I wait and see what happens watch with a workman like air
[3269.26s -> 3274.26s]  The gnome lowers the bucket clips the rope away once more inside the well and strolls away up the road
[3274.42s -> 3281.11s]  The well begins to sing again now. I'm ready to work again one gold piece and I'm your friend
[3284.20s -> 3308.59s]  Shit, I wanna rewind. Okay, ask him what he's doing
[3309.27s -> 3312.76s]  Okay, the gnome tips these out into a pouch
[3313.40s -> 3315.84s]  The gnome has a pouch of money grab the pouch
[3316.44s -> 3320.84s]  you reach down and snatch the pouch from the gnome who jumps almost out of his skin and then
[3321.36s -> 3326.84s]  Scarper's for cover in the well house once more in the pouch you find your gold piece
[3327.24s -> 3334.25s]  Along with a giant's tooth that someone must have thrown in by mistake. We've got two giant's teeth now. Yes
[3334.25s -> 3344.22s]  All right. That was worth a rewind. I have two now, right? Yep. Okay. Thank God. That was definitely worth a rewind
[3344.22s -> 3346.22s]  I'm out of rewinds by the way
[3346.34s -> 3357.90s]  Whatever you've reached a wide desolate area fenced off by an overgrown iron railing
[3358.43s -> 3362.51s]  Inside tall you trees reach up to twice the height of the city wall beyond
[3362.67s -> 3369.67s]  This is the necropolis the city of the dead for those who pass away and care with enough money to ensure their bodies are not
[3369.67s -> 3375.78s]  Simply tossed into the water the road to the north gate passes straight through and offers you no way around
[3375.90s -> 3380.83s]  The main path is wide enough for
[3381.11s -> 3382.35s]  processions and carts
[3382.35s -> 3389.23s]  But leading off it are several smaller paths that wind between the trees and headstones to all different suburbs of the graveyard
[3389.23s -> 3396.35s]  There are plenty of places for things to hide here enter the necropolis
[3396.83s -> 3407.59s]  After the hubbub of upper caray the necropolis has a silence which is almost deafening
[3407.87s -> 3411.80s]  Either side listing gravestones crawl with small creatures
[3412.14s -> 3418.12s]  No flowers grow here. It is like the bodies give off poison as they rot
[3419.04s -> 3426.53s]  Everything here is dead. And yet this place is neither empty nor still the graveyard
[3426.69s -> 3434.52s]  The wind whistles between the tall trees the Sun is setting behind the wall
[3434.80s -> 3441.21s]  Look around you step nervously off the path and walk between the nearest tomes
[3441.75s -> 3443.87s]  Some are ancient headstones
[3444.19s -> 3445.77s]  Ty
[3445.77s -> 3452.17s]  Tilted to crazy angles and some of them fallen face down as though the citizens of this graveyard have been drinking since they died
[3452.53s -> 3456.63s]  Others are fresh neatly carved and clean of all moss and weeds
[3456.79s -> 3466.08s]  They sparkle in the moonlight as though cleaned by maids and waiting for their occupants to arrive. Okay
[3466.88s -> 3471.68s]  explore the newer tombs explore the older tombs or
[3472.56s -> 3474.56s]  leave the graveyard
[3474.56s -> 3476.80s]  one
[3476.80s -> 3479.04s]  two three I
[3483.05s -> 3490.29s]  Will run a full one two three again one two three
[3490.73s -> 3502.14s]  One two three, what do you want to do? This is a one is newer tombs
[3502.58s -> 3506.88s]  Two is older tombs and three is to leave the graveyard
[3519.71s -> 3527.35s]  Hmm, where do they want to go? Seems to be pretty
[3528.11s -> 3539.15s]  Unanimous don't say that we're gonna be going to the older tombs. Thank you for voting explore the older tombs
[3539.51s -> 3546.16s]  You leave the path for the oldest area of the graveyard in the corner nearest to the city wall
[3546.60s -> 3551.96s]  Most of the stones here are now mere rubble a few statues lie facedown in the mud
[3551.96s -> 3559.56s]  A tree has split through a carved stone coffin search for grave goods
[3559.96s -> 3565.11s]  Find the oldest grave or search for grave goods
[3565.31s -> 3566.66s]  All right
[3566.66s -> 3574.26s]  We're gonna find we look for grave goods you search between the ancient headstones for any offerings of grave goods left behind
[3574.84s -> 3583.04s]  These tombs are hundreds of years old. No one visits them anymore and offerings that were left have long since sunk into the clay
[3583.44s -> 3589.72s]  Find the oldest grave you soon find what looks to be the oldest tomb
[3590.00s -> 3597.64s]  It is a small mausoleum with a low roof supported by ornately carved pillars an inscription reads here lies
[3597.88s -> 3600.44s]  Lorag founder of Kare
[3603.06s -> 3615.08s]  Lorag the tome is a simple stone cabinet carved with the likeness of a man from centuries of rain and wind
[3615.20s -> 3621.99s]  You can make out nothing of it, but a long grizzled beard below the inscription is a longer tablet
[3622.15s -> 3624.29s]  But it is half weathered and covered in moss
[3626.50s -> 3628.50s]  open the tomb
[3628.54s -> 3640.87s]  Mini F, you know, I actually this weirdly enough. So I figured out what was going on
[3640.87s -> 3644.47s]  I didn't really figure it out. It's something to do with the game
[3646.74s -> 3652.10s]  Because have you noticed that when I streamed multiverses that not there was no problems at all
[3652.10s -> 3657.15s]  I actually did a test with the game open
[3657.35s -> 3665.88s]  I streamed this with just the game open and going it through OBS to the test servers and I dropped like
[3666.08s -> 3672.82s]  10,000 frames and I looked over at my like my internet and there was no drop frames through OBS. It was weird
[3673.12s -> 3678.98s]  So something about how this game is captured and I've I tried to make change a few settings
[3679.28s -> 3687.18s]  but yeah, I I was literally streaming this game to the test servers and dropped 10,000 frames and
[3687.66s -> 3690.09s]  The internet was up the whole time
[3690.41s -> 3698.39s]  It was just up the entire time and it was like I was streaming the game to the server, right?
[3698.39s -> 3703.25s]  So I it was like you're dropping a ton of ton of frames 10,000 drop frames, but the twitch
[3704.41s -> 3708.87s]  Application I use is like no there's no drop frames. What are you talking about? So it's something to do with the game
[3708.87s -> 3711.91s]  So I apologize for that or maybe it's a little bit of both
[3711.91s -> 3720.78s]  I don't know but let's go we even need frames
[3724.07s -> 3727.83s]  Antivirus software hates this game for some reason. I don't think that's you
[3727.83s -> 3730.13s]  I don't think that should be the problem, but it's not a big deal
[3730.31s -> 3734.87s]  We you might see it happen once or twice a few times, but it's a text game. So we should be fine
[3735.27s -> 3749.00s]  Yeah, let's go. Okay, so I'm going to I'm gonna examine the man. I did put a frame limiter on this game
[3749.00s -> 3754.08s]  I put to make it so it doesn't have just like that like the 5,000 frames being rendered
[3754.28s -> 3760.75s]  So I put a hard frame limiter on the actual application itself, but it seems like doesn't really help that much
[3760.75s -> 3765.52s]  I don't know. Okay, you look closer at the car of man, but notice nothing more
[3765.52s -> 3769.12s]  It is just an engraving of an old man in a serene death pose
[3769.40s -> 3772.25s]  If this really is the grave of the founder of Carré
[3772.57s -> 3779.34s]  The chances are he did not die quite so peacefully the eyes of the carved statue appear to be watching you
[3779.58s -> 3786.12s]  You clear away the dirt from the carved inscription
[3786.24s -> 3794.05s]  But you still cannot make out the words only trace their outlines with your finger make a rubbing
[3794.57s -> 3799.85s]  For a rubbing of the inscription you would need some kind of charcoal to rub with and you have nothing to do that
[3799.93s -> 3807.44s]  We can't do it. All right, are we go are we opening this and getting like?
[3808.08s -> 3810.44s]  Possessed by the the demon that's in here, whatever
[3810.44s -> 3821.14s]  I mean we're going in right you look for a crack to lever open the lid of the tomb but find nothing
[3821.91s -> 3827.21s]  Presumably if there was anything here to steal it would have been long gone already you head away from the tomb fuck
[3827.21s -> 3831.02s]  We didn't have the right item for it. I couldn't do magic
[3831.66s -> 3844.17s]  Shit. All right, whatever. I we're gonna go to the newer tombs. There are several tombs here
[3844.33s -> 3850.88s]  There must have been a recent plague on the rich in the city. They're scattered around in roughly alphabetical groups
[3852.83s -> 3854.59s]  explore the tombs of
[3854.59s -> 3856.39s]  anagile to ferret
[3856.39s -> 3863.30s]  Explore tombs of Goyle to nephrit Oxl to Tamarin Oaks
[3863.82s -> 3868.40s]  Oaks or two years
[3868.40s -> 3873.75s]  Let's start down here. You browse around the tombs looking for a name you recognize
[3873.75s -> 3877.59s]  But none of them catch your eye something flitters past your face a bat
[3881.42s -> 3883.85s]  This is a bat who cares
[3885.08s -> 3896.84s]  Alright, how about but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, right?
[3898.03s -> 3900.15s]  Malus should we be looking for these names?
[3901.23s -> 3902.31s]  Corgo
[3902.31s -> 3912.82s]  Nick you're gonna be looking for these names. Let's do oxl to tamarin
[3913.06s -> 3918.51s]  You look from one headstone to the other a few catch your eye, though. You cannot immediately say why ah
[3922.85s -> 3932.00s]  Shinvas mausoleum you approach Shinvas mausoleum carved above its door is here of rest Lord Shinva
[3932.44s -> 3939.38s]  If noble of Kari here we go
[3939.72s -> 3950.72s]  The door to Shinvas mausoleum seems to be unlocked and as a crack ajar as though
[3950.72s -> 3955.24s]  Someone regularly came and went just in front of it is a ring of little mushrooms
[3955.88s -> 3957.88s]  Growing up against the front step of the mausoleum
[3958.52s -> 3971.66s]  Hell somebody here
[3973.19s -> 3975.19s]  How safe passage
[3977.70s -> 3985.32s]  Protect from magic sense danger big
[3986.36s -> 3988.24s]  grow in size
[3988.32s -> 3992.03s]  You just walk around huge
[3992.11s -> 4005.14s]  Just do big
[4005.14s -> 4010.90s]  Big or sauce. What would be okay? Why would I want to be huge here? I'm gonna do sauce
[4011.78s -> 4020.22s]  Cast the spell and your mind is filled with a clear sense of danger
[4021.02s -> 4023.46s]  Rising from the circle of mushrooms in front of you
[4024.24s -> 4028.96s]  Presumably they are poisonous, but you would surely not have been tempted to eat them anyway
[4029.08s -> 4038.84s]  So isn't the spell being overly cautious? I definitely would have eaten them. Look at the ring
[4039.16s -> 4041.16s]  You cross down and look at the mushrooms
[4041.20s -> 4047.88s]  They look highly poisonous not least because you cannot see a single insect crawling around or under any of them
[4048.76s -> 4056.94s]  Unusually the ring itself is also perfectly circular in shape in its center something silver glints a steak pushed into the soft soil
[4056.94s -> 4063.62s]  I take the steak you reach over to pull out the silver steak
[4063.62s -> 4078.26s]  But you cannot reach it without stepping inside the mushroom ring and your spell warned you against that but it's a shiny
[4078.54s -> 4092.77s]  Steak it's shiny metal do it. Anyway, I'm not taking it
[4092.77s -> 4099.40s]  It is too cold to stand still in the shadow of the wall. No jump over the ring
[4100.70s -> 4105.22s]  I'm so paranoid without this ring
[4105.22s -> 4113.41s]  I'm jumping over the ring you take a run-up and jump clear over the circle of mushrooms landing on the step of the mausoleum
[4113.41s -> 4122.82s]  I'm not walking through that nice magpie brain
[4123.02s -> 4132.73s]  Okay, shouldn't was tomb the air inside is freezing dust coats the floor urns line the walls
[4132.73s -> 4140.64s]  But there is no coffin the floor space is empty except for in the far corner where a narrow stone staircase leads down into darkness
[4146.40s -> 4151.83s]  fog
[4151.83s -> 4155.48s]  summon darkness
[4156.08s -> 4158.08s]  Dopp open doors
[4161.26s -> 4163.26s]  sap cause depression
[4165.24s -> 4187.96s]  Sun create light. Well, this is not dark. What else can I do all float in the air?
[4197.54s -> 4199.82s]  Okay, well will I use the Sun jewel?
[4200.38s -> 4203.96s]  Does it consume it or do I get to keep it? I don't know
[4204.34s -> 4206.12s]  That's why I don't want to use it
[4206.12s -> 4219.55s]  You cast the spell in the Sun jewel in your pack begins to throw and ebb growing brighter and brighter until it fills the room
[4219.55s -> 4226.31s]  With a pale but brilliant light that reveals the mausoleum for what it is old stone and dust and nothing worse for that
[4226.43s -> 4240.42s]  Your spirits soar. Let's go make a move skulls peer at you from the walls turn and flee go downstairs
[4242.12s -> 4244.80s]  Unafraid of what you might find below you make your way towards the stairs
[4245.00s -> 4250.28s]  But you must have stepped on some kind of switch as behind you you hear a noise and you turn to see the door
[4250.28s -> 4259.71s]  It's swinging shut try to block it run for it
[4259.71s -> 4267.92s]  Fuck it. You stay back not wanting to be crushed by the heavy stone door
[4267.92s -> 4279.32s]  It seals with a bang in the dark the echo of the slamming door circles the room your light forms a pool around your feet
[4279.48s -> 4286.45s]  Wait, this door did that or this way what door did that?
[4286.45s -> 4300.54s]  I don't need the coat the ape feel the door or catches. It was the entrance door
[4300.62s -> 4311.26s]  Yeah, make a move. We're going down the stairs. Maybe there's a way out below you head for the stairs once more holding your light
[4311.26s -> 4314.53s]  Out in front of you. I'm not leaving
[4317.74s -> 4322.71s]  Downwards you make your way cautiously down the ancient stairs into the dead earth
[4322.99s -> 4326.50s]  The walls are damp and there's a foul smell of decay
[4326.72s -> 4336.86s]  The only sound is a dripping coming from somewhere in the depths into the crypt you emerge into a large dark chamber
[4336.86s -> 4341.75s]  Lit only by the light from your Sun jewel a coffin occupies the center of the room
[4342.03s -> 4359.81s]  Covered over by dust and spider webs. It's a wait and watch you hang back taking a few breaths to ensure the room is silent
[4359.81s -> 4365.31s]  That's when you hear the sound a moan and a rattle of chains coming from inside the coffin
[4365.37s -> 4367.37s]  The lid is moving back
[4370.29s -> 4372.29s]  Push it closed
[4375.30s -> 4381.18s]  It's not like a boiling over a pot of like spaghetti. What do you mean? What do you mean put the lid on it?
[4381.18s -> 4391.42s]  What are you talking about? This is like a 5,000 year old demon person. I'm gonna stay back
[4393.30s -> 4399.18s]  You hang back watching and that's when you see the ghostly figure emerging from one of the owl cloves in the room
[4399.18s -> 4401.48s]  It is a death Wraith
[4401.60s -> 4403.80s]  wielding a cruel hooked dagger and
[4404.44s -> 4405.76s]  sliding
[4405.76s -> 4411.04s]  Mercilessly towards you death Wraiths like all ghosts can only be harmed by weapons of silver
[4411.08s -> 4418.90s]  But it is quite capable of causing you harm. Thank God. I brought the fucking arrows attack
[4418.98s -> 4430.56s]  What can I do on hot fireball?
[4434.28s -> 4435.56s]  God
[4435.56s -> 4438.40s]  Illusion of worship. Oh, I couldn't pretend to be a god
[4439.08s -> 4442.18s]  yak fear
[4442.18s -> 4449.07s]  Hell should I read his mind? I wonder what it's gonna say
[4449.91s -> 4453.95s]  Kill kill kill kill. Like why would I do that?
[4454.47s -> 4464.33s]  in summon a replica creature
[4465.09s -> 4467.09s]  Kid create an illusion
[4472.44s -> 4478.78s]  Wall invisible wall walk his shield
[4482.74s -> 4485.54s]  Just use the arrows
[4485.54s -> 4487.64s]  Hell does not cost stamina
[4487.64s -> 4499.75s]  You put on the skull cap and cast a spell reaching out to find the thoughts of the creature and perhaps learn something to your advantage
[4500.15s -> 4508.69s]  But you find nothing there is nothing and no one alive down here only specters shadows and death you hold on
[4513.50s -> 4525.87s]  Attack you stagger back to clear enough space to ready your weapon fire an arrow
[4526.23s -> 4535.14s]  Working quickly you unsling the bow from your back and notch an arrow the death Wraith grins with abhorrent glee
[4535.58s -> 4540.46s]  Until you let fly and the arrow strikes it in the arm it howls with pain
[4540.90s -> 4549.22s]  Shocked and angered at being hurt again. What follows is a terrible fight with every arrow you fire the death Wraith
[4549.54s -> 4550.62s]  Stagger is back
[4550.62s -> 4556.54s]  But as you reload the bow it creeps near again slashing at you with its knife as the quiver starts to run low
[4556.54s -> 4564.25s]  You know each arrow counts and should and should even one miss then Shinva's tomb will become your own as you reach for your last
[4564.25s -> 4568.50s]  Arrow the death Wraith beams with glee it is weakened
[4568.50s -> 4576.02s]  But still not defeated fire the last arrow you fire the last arrow aiming directly for the death Wraith's heart
[4576.14s -> 4584.24s]  The boat flies true in the silver arrowhead buries itself deeply into the specters being it begins to flicker and fade and then with a last
[4584.70s -> 4590.58s]  Tortured gasp it slumps to the floor and threw it melting away into the cold stone
[4590.66s -> 4595.13s]  The crypt becomes peaceful as the battle ends
[4595.17s -> 4603.36s]  But then there is a creaking sound that makes you look back at the coffin it has opened and a figure is rising up
[4603.36s -> 4614.58s]  You watch as the figure takes shape a very old man and no monster
[4616.79s -> 4625.39s]  Stranger I am in a great debt to you now at last I can die in peace
[4626.11s -> 4634.20s]  Tell me quickly before I am lost how may I repay you you stare in amazement
[4634.40s -> 4649.09s]  This must be the fifth noble Lord Shinva himself you step forward to greet the apparition
[4649.09s -> 4654.50s]  Oh, this is important. You are Lord Shinva. I have come to find out about the North Gate
[4654.50s -> 4657.30s]  I'm looking for the first noble. I required nothing of yours
[4657.42s -> 4667.22s]  I've come to find out about the North Gate you come looking in a strange place
[4667.22s -> 4674.98s]  Then the only gate down here leads to the underworld and I have been denied it for a very long time
[4675.06s -> 4677.88s]  Time

[4731.60s -> 4736.28s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm looking for the first noble of the city
[4736.28s -> 4744.47s]  I'm looking for the first noble of the city that I hope your mission is to kill him
[4744.75s -> 4752.30s]  The first noble will bring this city to wreck and ruin if that has not happened already while I have been down here
[4752.74s -> 4755.19s]  Tell me
[4755.19s -> 4759.95s]  This car I still stand nah, dude
[4759.95s -> 4776.66s]  It's fuck shit got fucked up like 20 years ago. Does it still stand? Should I say for now?
[4776.66s -> 4785.77s]  I feel like that's like hey, give me some info or should I be like, it's fucked up. It's over
[4785.77s -> 4792.85s]  I don't know what to say. Yeah, honey to pull

[4815.64s -> 4823.70s]  Yeah, what I have to say is no and it's all your fault he's like no
[4826.26s -> 4843.86s]  Okay, one two or three this would be quick that would be wicked fucked up
[4843.90s -> 4856.21s]  Yeah, it would be all this dude's just turn around just open the window behind him and look out and be like it's fine
[4856.21s -> 4865.95s]  How dare you? All right for now everyone's saying for now for now for now for all right. All right
[4865.95s -> 4873.46s]  All right, all right for now for now. He nods you shall see what follows perhaps
[4873.46s -> 4877.88s]  I will not I met a fortune teller once
[4878.56s -> 4880.00s]  a woman named
[4880.00s -> 4885.46s]  Cirici and she showed me how Sansa's would bring the city of fire and destruction
[4885.46s -> 4892.16s]  It was this knowledge that led to my fate of course such as the way of fortunes
[4892.50s -> 4898.67s]  Trickles of dust rained down from the roof of the crypt, but you are Lord Shinva
[4898.67s -> 4908.84s]  I am oh, I was once the fifth noble of the city. Would you believe?
[4910.71s -> 4916.37s]  And you who are you? I'm a stranger
[4916.37s -> 4926.76s]  I'm from Anna land Shinra raises a dusty eyebrow. I know what interest does Anna land have in the ways of Kari
[4928.28s -> 4932.26s]  Hmm. I traveled to the backlands
[4932.26s -> 4940.29s]  I see so you need to pass through the North Gate and for that you must know the spell
[4940.57s -> 4948.85s]  Perhaps you know it already. No. No, I do you know it. I tell me it. Do you know what it is?
[4948.85s -> 4955.38s]  No, I don't know it. What should I say? Do you know it? Do you know it?
[4955.38s -> 4964.08s]  I know one line one lock made of golems hide
[4964.08s -> 4978.74s]  I wish you luck finding the others but tell me what lies in the backlands that Anna land could want I explore for myself
[4979.42s -> 4987.66s]  Mampang and the crown of Kings. I mean this guy's about to disappear. Thanks for the line. I got what I wanted
[4987.66s -> 4996.89s]  I'm here for the crown of Kings a crown. What of the crown? It has been stolen. Oh
[5000.50s -> 5003.32s]  Then today is a good day to die
[5003.76s -> 5011.04s]  Crown of Kings is an ancient object you understand from a time when the world was young and great forces
[5011.04s -> 5013.30s]  Stuck the land force is too great
[5013.44s -> 5022.28s]  But such as we are today powers that could shape beings and minds with the slightest whim and mold the land and see to their will
[5022.36s -> 5031.90s]  Do you understand what the crown does it provides influence? It allows control. It is nothing just a symbol
[5035.29s -> 5041.02s]  It provides I think it provides influence provides control dead guy voice
[5047.71s -> 5060.93s]  Influencer crown it provides influence. It provides influence much more than that
[5062.14s -> 5068.10s]  Only once was I in the power of the crown as it passed from lend the land to Bryce
[5068.10s -> 5074.08s]  I was an envoy at the court when it arrived and as the power to turn your will to
[5074.20s -> 5078.37s]  Another's without you knowing what is happening. You see the power of that
[5078.51s -> 5085.02s]  No one under the influence of the crown can ever revolt as they do not understand that they are in servitude
[5085.14s -> 5096.78s]  What can you tell me of the backlands very little? Oh, but I remember one told to me in my crib
[5096.94s -> 5105.99s]  Will you hear it? Yes, please tell me for sleeping of the sleepless ram seek out the one they call the sham
[5106.35s -> 5110.30s]  Shinva shakes his ancient head
[5110.30s -> 5116.81s]  I could not tell you what the sleepless ram is perhaps device and not mere nonsense
[5116.95s -> 5125.34s]  Your light flickers for a moment ready to plunge you into darkness. Farewell old man. Farewell stranger
[5125.42s -> 5132.01s]  May your life and fate be better than mine the spell lines you have found are listed in the key section of your inventory
[5132.61s -> 5135.49s]  Finally with a withered finger
[5135.49s -> 5142.66s]  He directs your attention to a gnarled rope that hangs down in one corner of the room that controls the trap on the door
[5150.20s -> 5157.26s]  And he's gone
[5157.26s -> 5168.56s]  RIP shit fuck that's just bugleberry
[5168.88s -> 5178.82s]  No, it's they're different you slash the rope with your sword a heavy counterweight falls and shatters to the floor
[5178.90s -> 5185.06s]  Lord Shinva nods wait. He's not he's still here. Well, she even nods and drifts towards his coffin
[5185.06s -> 5189.44s]  I give the last of my life to you
[5189.58s -> 5198.51s]  You feel a cold strength flood your veins and turn quickly and make your way upstairs
[5198.75s -> 5208.13s]  Nice the door at the far end of the mausoleum is open step outside
[5208.35s -> 5227.46s]  You return through the open door to the path still shivering from your meeting with a ghost. So hold on. Okay, where's my?
[5228.42s -> 5244.90s]  Victorious noble Northgate spell. Do I have this like the spell anywhere? It was just the clues the keys
[5245.18s -> 5254.47s]  Okay, that's Shinva's line one lock made of golems hide. I have a bunch of other clues too. I need three more
[5254.99s -> 5258.00s]  We have enough. We have a lot of clues for the other ones. I think
[5258.48s -> 5263.15s]  You avoid the ring of mushrooms as you leave
[5263.67s -> 5266.67s]  Outside night is falling and things are stirring between the moaning trees
[5266.87s -> 5275.35s]  You would do well not to linger here so scurries across your foot and is gone. All right, we're up this way
[5278.58s -> 5289.54s]  Leaving the graveyard you return to the path gratefully and make your way to the far side of the graveyard
[5290.26s -> 5292.42s]  Beside the gate is a disused well
[5292.42s -> 5298.53s]  Perhaps once used to draw water to wash the bodies before in turn mint look down
[5298.73s -> 5301.73s]  You lean over the side of the well house to peer down
[5301.97s -> 5305.89s]  It's pitch black of course and seems to go down forever and for a moment
[5305.89s -> 5311.37s]  It looks as though there is something in the shaft but a moment later it is gone a trick of the moonlight
[5311.41s -> 5320.86s]  Perhaps pull the bucket up you turn the winch on the side of the well drawing up the bucket from beneath
[5321.06s -> 5323.06s]  It comes to the top filled with clear water
[5323.06s -> 5326.56s]  Is this as fresh as the water from the other fountain you tried?
[5326.92s -> 5335.14s]  Frank you scoop a handful of water and taste it despite your surroundings. It is fresh and quite clear
[5335.38s -> 5344.34s]  You like a 20 health throw a coin in you toss a gold piece in it falls for a long while and then you hear a
[5344.34s -> 5353.47s]  Distant tiny splash the rear gate of the graveyard hangs from its hinges, but not from age
[5353.83s -> 5355.83s]  It seems it has been taken apart
[5355.95s -> 5367.64s]  Maybe widened even to let something through beyond as a deep forest when's green screen movie night part two Saturday
[5368.50s -> 5383.40s]  Saturday this weekend. We're gonna do it again this Saturday. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep green screen part two
[5384.06s -> 5389.92s]  All right, let's keep moving. It'd be another
[5390.36s -> 5391.80s]  one to
[5391.80s -> 5399.91s]  130 150 videos you walk for half an hour through thick trees along a narrowing track
[5400.11s -> 5407.18s]  Until you reach a fork in the road to the left the track gets narrower still to the right a massive shadow looms
[5407.42s -> 5412.02s]  so large it seems as though a colossus has seated itself on the wall and thought a
[5412.86s -> 5420.68s]  Chill wind blows through you as though ghosts walked back and forth this way the shadowy
[5421.00s -> 5424.10s]  Thing to the right has a jagged silhouette
[5424.34s -> 5430.13s]  It's a ziggurat with perhaps a hundred steps leading to its apex the trees whisper and move
[5430.45s -> 5435.45s]  Looking left you see distant flicker torchlight through the trees the north gate
[5435.45s -> 5441.33s]  Perhaps night is drawing in you should get moving things whisper between the tweeze
[5441.37s -> 5453.75s]  The ziggurat or the road to the gate one or two
[5454.23s -> 5457.78s]  Let's get a pole going for one or two one
[5458.54s -> 5459.62s]  two
[5459.62s -> 5488.49s]  One leads up to the gate two goes into the ziggurat one two two for the tiger mount
[5488.85s -> 5498.18s]  I don't know that's a reference to is that a wild reference all right. We're going to
[5498.74s -> 5502.06s]  Thanks for voting the ziggurat
[5502.34s -> 5512.53s]  you stand at the base of a towering ziggurat built from carved stone blocks each the size of a hay bale the temple rises higher than the
[5512.53s -> 5519.06s]  City wall and position to catch the first star of evening at its uppermost point a moment
[5519.06s -> 5525.88s]  Which is just passed for an opening you tilt your head back looking for an opening and finally make one out a
[5526.16s -> 5528.80s]  Small black dot about a third of the way up
[5528.80s -> 5536.04s]  But even that is quite some climb for the less devoted worshippers a small gargoyle by the steps has an open mouth
[5536.48s -> 5553.28s]  Ready to accept offerings climb up a look at the gargoyle the gargoyle is carved in the shape of a small but spiky dog
[5553.44s -> 5560.31s]  With long claws sharp horns and a pointy beard its mouth is wide open and its tongue
[5560.43s -> 5564.79s]  Lawls out with a coin-shaped slot at the back of its throat
[5571.85s -> 5578.57s]  You need to take attack the tail
[5578.65s -> 5587.08s]  Okay, so drop in a gold piece you slide a gold piece in the gargoyle's mouth for a moment
[5587.08s -> 5593.54s]  Nothing happens then it appears to swallow and next it opens its stone eyelids to reveal two crisp and beautiful eyes
[5593.94s -> 5596.73s]  Look into the eyes
[5596.73s -> 5601.05s]  Looking into the gargoyle's eyes fills you with a sense of calm and peace
[5601.41s -> 5608.33s]  The eyes closed after a moment, but the sense of well-being remains, or did you just imagine that the gargoyle moved?
[5608.49s -> 5623.61s]  Oh, what should I do climb make a move make a move you have a healthy fear of Kari's weirder gods
[5623.61s -> 5626.81s]  You return to the fork. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what I wanted
[5627.01s -> 5637.75s]  That is not what I wanted. Let's do everything the same way did it
[5638.15s -> 5649.42s]  Okay, climb up you begin the climb hauling yourself up the first step either this ziggurat was built for giants or
[5649.90s -> 5656.32s]  Ascending as an act of devotion the next few steps are equally exhausting you have to throw your pack up first and follow
[5656.32s -> 5662.45s]  I think I remember doing this last time
[5666.87s -> 5669.83s]  Zen hover. Yeah, I think I remember doing this
[5671.62s -> 5681.54s]  Sun create light. Yeah, we can do big and just yeah, we can do big. Oh
[5684.33s -> 5686.33s]  Sauce is good is there too. What else?
[5687.57s -> 5690.45s]  How is interesting safe passage?
[5690.85s -> 5705.55s]  Float in the air is a good one. Are they both one? Yeah, I remember doing big before
[5706.17s -> 5717.85s]  Let's do it. You cast a spell swelling to three times your size. You are now able to run up the stairs
[5718.53s -> 5720.49s]  But the scale quickly changes
[5720.49s -> 5726.33s]  It seems the builders of the pyramid created an optical illusion and the later steps are not as high as the lower ones
[5726.45s -> 5729.89s]  The change is so gradual that you hardly notice as the spell fades
[5730.09s -> 5737.06s]  You reach a halfway point almost as high as the city wall beyond and pause to rest halfway up
[5737.06s -> 5740.49s]  You're halfway up
[5740.49s -> 5748.84s]  breezies of gargoyles and polished metals ring the temple on this level view you pause to take the in the view
[5749.00s -> 5752.57s]  from this side of the ziggurat you can see nothing but the top of the wall and
[5752.93s -> 5759.76s]  Beyond the gleaming darkness of the marshes of the backlands walk around to the north walk around to the north
[5760.04s -> 5766.77s]  You move around to the north face. You can see the path ahead running straight between wild and overgrown trees
[5767.01s -> 5772.07s]  It seems very few people come this way anymore. The north gate itself is now visible
[5772.07s -> 5778.48s]  However, and appears deserted then you notice a point of light torches been lit between the trees
[5778.72s -> 5786.91s]  Watch the torches you watch as the torches move through the trees towards the path. They're making slow progress
[5787.39s -> 5792.11s]  But they are moving towards the graveyard and presumably from there on into town
[5792.27s -> 5805.50s]  The wind claws at you trying to pull you to earth. I haven't eaten. I only have one revision
[5805.56s -> 5810.65s]  I'll eat it at least away from the rats and night foxes that live on the ground
[5810.65s -> 5814.21s]  You're free to eat you take out the last of your cheese and I still have cheese
[5814.57s -> 5826.67s]  You still I still have cheese from like three months ago. However long it's been. Okay
[5826.99s -> 5833.39s]  Let's go higher you continue the weary climb to the first level of the ziggurat by the opening
[5833.47s -> 5842.14s]  You climb for another 20 minutes up the steep stone steps until you are gasping and panting for breath once more
[5842.24s -> 5846.52s]  But finally you reach the dark opening that you saw from the base of the temple
[5846.68s -> 5851.10s]  The steps themselves continue up a little further still to the very peak of the temple
[5851.38s -> 5856.53s]  The opening is guarded by rock sculpted images of unimaginable creatures
[5857.01s -> 5861.61s]  Beyond you see a long dark hallway with something large and gleaming at the far end
[5862.01s -> 5867.05s]  Treasure I mean
[5873.91s -> 5887.16s]  You step into the temple the hollow space
[5887.80s -> 5894.24s]  Amplifies your footsteps and they echo eerily for several moments on the floor in
[5894.64s -> 5897.76s]  Guilt inlay is written the name of the god who inhabits this space
[5897.84s -> 5908.90s]  It seems that the ziggurat is of corga the gracious don't wait. I have something on corga
[5909.40s -> 5919.58s]  Corgas three eyes the ritual of corga involves his three eyes the left eye right eye and the third eye in his forehead
[5920.02s -> 5928.22s]  That it I think I remember this
[5928.76s -> 5940.26s]  Yeah, I remember this I forget I forget everything. Okay, let's wait
[5940.64s -> 5943.64s]  You wait for a few heartbeats to see if you have disturbed anything
[5944.16s -> 5948.73s]  Nothing happens and you catch the tail of a gigantic snake
[5949.29s -> 5955.92s]  Slithering across the floor and disappearing into a crack in one wall for the markings along its back. It's highly poisonous
[5956.44s -> 5965.78s]  Drink my snake antidote. I didn't get bit yet. Why would I drink the antidote? I didn't get bit drink the antidote
[5966.06s -> 5968.78s]  Why would I drink it now? I haven't gotten bit yet
[5973.00s -> 5985.59s]  Free antidote. Let's go. Oh shit. You went to the temple, but the snake still manages to catch you by surprise
[5986.76s -> 5989.16s]  Launching itself from a crack in the ceiling behind you
[5993.89s -> 5997.92s]  All right, we're going like eight. Oh
[5999.76s -> 6001.08s]  Come on
[6001.08s -> 6007.10s]  Temple snake snaps and hisses in the air between you you swing out
[6007.18s -> 6012.14s]  Wildly hoping to chop it in two as it slivers away and do around a pillar out of reach
[6012.50s -> 6023.01s]  It lifts up bearing its mighty fangs dripping with poison. Oh fuck you you drop into a crouch the temple snake strikes
[6023.01s -> 6029.97s]  You desperately defend yourself against its poison soaked fangs. You fall badly as you stagger back. It hisses from the darkness
[6029.97s -> 6035.57s]  All right, so they just went full blast. We're gonna go like two like two point. Yeah
[6036.13s -> 6037.34s]  Good
[6037.34s -> 6046.02s]  Now we go full blast. It spits in the gloom. Is it can I get it and get it?
[6046.70s -> 6048.34s]  Yep, dead
[6048.34s -> 6056.26s]  Temple snake is retreating but you give chase you cleave the air with your sword with a weird scream that echoes around the cold stone
[6056.42s -> 6059.70s]  The snake dies its head crashing to the floor
[6059.74s -> 6065.99s]  You wipe your sword clean and wait for the violent echoes of the fight to fade away
[6066.19s -> 6070.17s]  Then you go further in the side of the shrine takes your breath away
[6070.45s -> 6079.26s]  The walls are decorated with brightly colored murals depicting scenes from the religious mythology of Kare fine ornaments and precious metals
[6079.26s -> 6086.61s]  Are set into owl cloves around the pews and rich woven tapestries cover every surface a cunning trick of architecture
[6087.03s -> 6089.03s]  catches the wind past the doorway and
[6089.15s -> 6095.40s]  Creates a constant ethereal humming as though a crowd of monks sat in permanent meditation inside
[6095.58s -> 6113.18s]  Leave further in at the far end of the hallway for large stone gargoyles of winged demons watch over the shrine
[6113.42s -> 6115.42s]  from mounts high up in the eaves
[6115.90s -> 6119.22s]  Guarding the altar on which a gigantic idol squats
[6119.74s -> 6126.14s]  Corga himself. It is a life-size version of the model of Corga you saw in the abandoned house yesterday
[6136.74s -> 6146.34s]  Steal something approach the altar. I'm not gonna steal anything. This is the dumb thing to do
[6146.50s -> 6149.24s]  This is how you get the wrath of the gods
[6149.52s -> 6159.74s]  I'm approaching the altar you walk up towards the altar across a richly patterned carpet something about it gives you pause
[6159.74s -> 6163.32s]  Its surface is decorated with wide symbols that seem to deliberate
[6163.64s -> 6171.82s]  Too deliberate to be accidental walk across avoid the star shapes avoid the circles avoid the spirals cast a spell
[6185.85s -> 6187.77s]  Can't we know
[6187.77s -> 6190.26s]  Zen is float
[6190.50s -> 6194.28s]  How would be good right what but that's too literal isn't it?
[6194.98s -> 6202.18s]  Wouldn't it just say turn around and leave yeah, it's gonna say turn around and walk out the door remember
[6202.18s -> 6206.78s]  How is completely literal it's just how to find a safe passage is out
[6207.50s -> 6211.18s]  It's not gonna be like oh the carpet do this that no it's gonna go leave turn around
[6217.24s -> 6218.68s]  mmm, I
[6218.68s -> 6223.02s]  Could float I'm just gonna float over it
[6223.54s -> 6230.83s]  Cast the spell reducing your weight to that of a feather you should now be safe from any pressure traps and just go across
[6231.51s -> 6236.21s]  Relying on your spell to keep you safe you step forward across the carpet towards the idol
[6236.21s -> 6240.35s]  But it seems whatever trap is here does not require much weight to be triggered
[6240.59s -> 6248.28s]  Something happens although you cannot be sure what one moment you're in the temple of corga and the next you are falling what
[6248.70s -> 6252.30s]  What are you talking about?
[6252.30s -> 6260.50s]  You're floating slowly down through the air turning and over you're in pitch blackness. You cannot see a thing no
[6260.78s -> 6267.98s]  I'm in the sewer again. No no no no no no no no no I can't rewind let me rewind
[6268.14s -> 6277.27s]  Can I let me rewind please I don't have any more rewinds left, but can I just go back?
[6277.27s -> 6290.62s]  I want to do that I used them all can I go I want to go do that can I go do it you made your choice up
[6291.04s -> 6299.99s]  Okay, all right run a poll can we get can we get a chat's choice rewind it has to get at least if it has
[6299.99s -> 6314.40s]  To get at least 50% to be yes has to be at least 50%
[6317.55s -> 6327.45s]  That's so easy to get to all right. I'll make it harder at least 70% save scum
[6327.45s -> 6332.04s]  I know, but I want to I want to go do that. Okay. I just got like thrown across the whole game
[6332.04s -> 6344.97s]  I just went into the air and floated and the God was just like no dude. That's not happening all right
[6345.03s -> 6356.27s]  That's at 76% just walk back there, bro. That's so far away sure
[6356.79s -> 6365.90s]  Can I can I actually get back up there? I don't think I can I don't I actually don't think I can get back up there
[6365.90s -> 6379.94s]  And I think it's gonna be great out. I can just keep going
[6380.38s -> 6384.52s]  Yeah, do can I actually get back up there when I get out?
[6384.92s -> 6421.99s]  Okay, okay, you cast the spell and a clear calm voice enters your mind and informs you
[6422.23s -> 6428.76s]  There is indeed a trap in the rug in front of you before it can tell you where a second presence enters your mind
[6429.10s -> 6434.58s]  Booming it declares make your choice worshiper
[6434.92s -> 6444.93s]  Corga himself perhaps avoid the stars the circles of the spirals
[6454.61s -> 6459.72s]  The circles avoid the circles all right
[6459.72s -> 6466.59s]  I'm gonna go avoid the circles you walk up to the altar stepping carefully around the circle in the carpet and re yeah
[6466.59s -> 6477.04s]  All right. Yes, we made it you stand before the idol a fat statue set with gems and curious pock marked features
[6477.22s -> 6488.03s]  Above his head is a plaque that bears an inscription read it
[6489.04s -> 6494.73s]  Reads on corgas face you kiss across and finish with the lips
[6495.09s -> 6499.61s]  For answers to your questions you must err not else he spits
[6499.77s -> 6506.11s]  You step nervously up the steps until you are below the great statue you consider the idol
[6506.11s -> 6509.26s]  It is the same as the statuette in the abandoned house
[6509.70s -> 6516.32s]  Except that had blue dots painted on its two eyes its third eye in the forehead and on its lips
[6516.56s -> 6528.66s]  Okay on corgas face you kiss across and finish with the lips for answers to your questions
[6528.66s -> 6538.70s]  You must err not else he spits okay, so don't ask a question because he's gonna literally spit in your face
[6538.78s -> 6544.65s]  So we need to on corgas face you kiss across
[6545.01s -> 6557.19s]  Finish so you do the you kiss the lips last you stand on tiptoes and lean in preparing to kiss the statue
[6557.19s -> 6561.99s]  But where does the humming in the temple seem to be getting louder I can pray to the ape
[6566.11s -> 6572.70s]  Imagine going into another God's temple and putting your hands together and praying to your God and my God is an ape
[6572.84s -> 6575.21s]  This is like an all-powerful
[6575.21s -> 6581.69s]  Like super demon God I have this I have like a monkey. That's just to hang it out looking over a cloud
[6581.85s -> 6591.10s]  But what is the ape gonna do here? That's blasphemous should I pray to the ape?
[6591.10s -> 6592.62s]  I'm gonna do it for fun
[6592.62s -> 6599.08s]  You try a prayer to the ape for guidance, but it seems in the temple of another God the ape cannot hear you
[6599.12s -> 6601.84s]  You're on you're on oh
[6601.84s -> 6609.15s]  Okay, all right
[6609.15s -> 6614.53s]  It was it was a cross right and then lips last
[6614.91s -> 6622.64s]  Ritual of corga involves his three eyes left eye right eye in the third eye in the forehead
[6622.64s -> 6638.78s]  So what we go left right forehead left right forehead left right forehead lips or left forehead, right?
[6638.90s -> 6644.76s]  Let's go for it left eye. It's the left eye first
[6644.76s -> 6654.40s]  You place a kiss on the idols left eye you hear something flittering in the upper levels of the temple kiss the idols right eye
[6654.84s -> 6665.04s]  Next you kiss the right eye kiss the idols forehead. It's the idols lips
[6666.46s -> 6674.38s]  Finally you lean low and kiss the idols lips as you straighten once more you see the idols eyes flick open a soft voice
[6674.38s -> 6678.95s]  issues from its mouth
[6678.95s -> 6686.72s]  Stranger you are not of my faith and yet you have completed my ritual. How can that be?
[6686.72s -> 6705.73s]  I merely read your instructions. I'm lucky. I've merely read your instructions the gods laughs softly
[6706.09s -> 6711.10s]  Graciously very well. I see you are modest if impolite
[6711.20s -> 6713.76s]  My reward is to answer one question
[6714.16s -> 6723.11s]  But I am the god of grace and I require my followers to show grace and you have not I can see all
[6723.83s -> 6730.36s]  Remember, I am a god and I see that you have committed murder a red-eye guard
[6730.72s -> 6735.67s]  So I deny you my aid as you denied others their lives
[6735.99s -> 6743.52s]  His voice rises from a gentle whisper to a rolling thunder that echoes around the walls now leave
[6743.66s -> 6747.32s]  Or I will repay you in kind
[6757.99s -> 6767.51s]  What get the ape down here? Oh, yeah. Oh fuck you. I got the ape. What are you gonna say that?
[6772.53s -> 6785.26s]  Yeah, fuck you Corga argue you deny me my right you declare I
[6789.01s -> 6791.01s]  deny you
[6792.01s -> 6794.50s]  Everything
[6795.30s -> 6809.65s]  And then the idol moves standing gracefully onto its two bow legs and leans forward tag the monkey in do I run no
[6809.65s -> 6814.82s]  Let's fight this motherfucker. I look I've got beeswax. I have a helmet
[6815.42s -> 6821.59s]  Drive run what you can't kill somebody if you kill people you can't do this
[6821.59s -> 6829.75s]  I don't remember this breeze before you can react the statue of Corga plants a mechanical kiss on your forehead
[6829.85s -> 6836.84s]  You hear the click, but you do not feel the sting of the poison dart as it enters your skin and burrows into your brain
[6837.32s -> 6847.28s]  Okay, whatever
[6847.28s -> 6858.41s]  So I just have to leave I can't what am I supposed to do?
[6858.41s -> 6863.07s]  I have to leave I literally might as well just rewind back to when I was in the sewer
[6863.07s -> 6895.43s]  I should have stayed in the sewer then is there anything else I can do here. Okay, I am I've read
[6895.43s -> 6899.25s]  I've read your instructions. Oh, you killed people. Oh, I
[6900.53s -> 6903.15s]  I'm gonna repay you in kind fine. Fuck off leave
[6903.15s -> 6906.93s]  You don't need a second warning you turn and hurry out of the temple for the god can get revenge
[6907.17s -> 6922.27s]  What a fucking crock of shit you're back by the opening in the temple what I killed a person
[6922.47s -> 6925.23s]  So I'm not allowed to have a god
[6925.83s -> 6931.43s]  Help me go back up. Oh
[6932.15s -> 6940.33s]  Wait, yeah, I can go to the top right right right. Let's go up top
[6940.37s -> 6948.48s]  All right climb for the top you turn back to the steps and climb higher
[6948.76s -> 6954.28s]  All the way to the top of the ziggurat night has fallen star spread across the sky in a peaceful repose
[6954.78s -> 6956.78s]  That bellies their true nature
[6957.50s -> 6962.17s]  Warring spirits tussling for control of the world below. Look at the stars
[6962.73s -> 6967.09s]  With your head tilted back. You can see more stars than you ever have seen in this city
[6967.65s -> 6975.25s]  Perhaps you are above the level of the lights and the smog and the dust or perhaps more stars choose to cluster here
[6975.49s -> 6977.73s]  around this sacred site if
[6977.73s -> 6984.01s]  You were a true mage and not a mere sorcerer who knows what spells one could weave at a spot like this
[6984.43s -> 7002.18s]  You lean back and look up trying to recognize the stars from your studies puke
[7010.02s -> 7013.16s]  Tar have I learned anything
[7013.72s -> 7015.72s]  Have I do I any info?
[7016.00s -> 7039.86s]  Did I get any info? I might have I don't know zip are
[7040.74s -> 7043.93s]  res
[7043.93s -> 7057.26s]  Zed I would have had to have known it the page at the beginning had CA
[7057.98s -> 7066.71s]  That's right that the lady took it didn't she is there a CA here?
[7067.03s -> 7082.53s]  Let's try there's no see
[7085.72s -> 7094.50s]  Pu per I know that there's a few combinations you can actually do here and I am not I don't
[7094.90s -> 7099.33s]  Her is good. There's I know there's at least three or four you can get from this
[7099.85s -> 7103.04s]  Should I do per puke? Should I try per?
[7103.72s -> 7105.68s]  What does purr do?
[7105.68s -> 7117.42s]  Her all right. I'm gonna try it fashion stars into alignment and an enchantment is created
[7117.80s -> 7122.44s]  For a moment nothing seems to happen and then a screeching noise reaches you
[7122.96s -> 7129.36s]  From the distance and across the city. It is the sound of a thousand mewling stray cats
[7129.88s -> 7136.45s]  It lasts a few minutes and then fades away you found one of the secret spells of the temple of corga
[7137.09s -> 7140.70s]  What I can summon a thousand cats
[7141.26s -> 7148.71s]  You look out across the city in the far distance you see torches in the woods towards the north gate
[7149.33s -> 7155.21s]  Looking back you see the lights of caray coming on and the shouts of revelers drunks and nighttime thieves
[7155.81s -> 7163.87s]  The view is quite run. It's wonderful, but your journey beckons you start the long climb back down the ziggurat once more
[7164.43s -> 7177.70s]  Hmm, let's go the climb back down is going easier halfway down you pause to rest
[7178.14s -> 7184.69s]  You look out to the north the thick trees are still lit by torchlight and you hear the distant bang of wolves
[7185.23s -> 7193.72s]  Half an hour passes nothing changes except the sky grows colder and the wind picks up cutting through your cloak wait
[7194.16s -> 7201.41s]  You settle down to wait on one of the stone steps watching as the line of torches fans out through the trees and
[7201.87s -> 7205.29s]  Marches slowly forward as some disappear new ones are lit
[7205.49s -> 7212.37s]  But eventually after the Sun is finally gone and the stars come up above you the trees around the north gate are inky blank
[7212.37s -> 7215.99s]  And there is no light except for a single flame on the gate itself
[7216.25s -> 7226.97s]  The way through the forest should now be clear. Oh, that was this that was going this way. Okay, so now that I was looking at this
[7227.49s -> 7240.09s]  There's a bunch of torches, right? Okay. Okay, work the mud under for to stamp with footprints and in between them the Prince of
[7240.09s -> 7241.33s]  many paws
[7241.33s -> 7254.00s]  The road to the gate you walk between clawing trees and thick bushes
[7254.08s -> 7256.08s]  The north gate is finally in sight
[7256.20s -> 7259.76s]  You can see it's imposing or nately carved wooden doors
[7260.14s -> 7266.46s]  Over the top of the guard huts and low buildings that lie at the end of the road you pause to watch the guard huts
[7266.58s -> 7273.74s]  They seem quite still one has a hole in its roof weed grows through the chimney of another are they abandoned?
[7273.78s -> 7276.21s]  But before here in there is a long road
[7276.65s -> 7283.99s]  Lined by thick and gloomy trees a patch of wild forest like you haven't seen since the hills go cautiously
[7284.43s -> 7289.94s]  You make your way slowly forward trying to ensure your feet do not crunch too loudly on the gravel
[7290.12s -> 7301.75s]  Something is keeping pace with you just behind the tree line stalking you stop and look you stop and turn to look into the trees
[7301.75s -> 7303.67s]  There's the faintest flicker of a gleam
[7303.67s -> 7310.23s]  And that's all the warning you get a wild bristlebeast leaps up from the trees and knocks you down you scramble for the sword
[7310.75s -> 7315.60s]  Set right here. Nice
[7316.76s -> 7318.12s]  start
[7318.12s -> 7319.60s]  Do it again
[7319.60s -> 7323.64s]  Got it again clean
[7323.96s -> 7325.80s]  We're gonna go again
[7325.80s -> 7328.26s]  2.1. Oops. Oops rewind rewind
[7333.11s -> 7334.31s]  I think I have enough
[7334.31s -> 7339.83s]  Okay, that's fine. I have to defend now
[7340.45s -> 7348.92s]  Drops its jaw. All right, it's coming in. Oh fuck off. It's coming in now. I have to defend again
[7349.68s -> 7358.85s]  That's fine. Now I go full blast the bristlebeast hunkers down
[7359.61s -> 7366.05s]  Got it leveling your blade you strike backed up against a tree
[7366.05s -> 7369.99s]  You can barely swing your sword, but you muster all of your strength with a final swing
[7369.99s -> 7376.15s]  You bury your blade deep into the bristle beast it twists on the metal then curls up like an overheated beetle and dies
[7376.37s -> 7386.49s]  The night air falls silent once more you continue on quickly through the trees. You're at the north gate
[7387.11s -> 7395.71s]  You've reached the north gate the ground before it is wide and clear and lit by blazing torches set into brackets
[7395.91s -> 7400.66s]  Either side of the enormous sealed doors should there be archers hiding in the shadows
[7400.78s -> 7406.55s]  They would have a clear sight of you off to one side as a well, but there's no other cover
[7406.59s -> 7420.02s]  You don't know all the spell lines, of course, but perhaps the gate will open to adopt spell after all don't have all the spell line
[7425.85s -> 7428.01s]  I will tell you guys
[7429.38s -> 7432.38s]  I know what happens when you get to the door and
[7433.53s -> 7438.41s]  It is not up. It does not work. I have one spell line
[7440.95s -> 7449.73s]  It'll work clueless. It'll work huff blow it down
[7452.70s -> 7454.69s]  This how
[7454.69s -> 7465.76s]  No, no, I okay. I think I'm trying to remember how this plays out
[7465.90s -> 7469.63s]  I know how it plays out, but I don't know how you get there
[7470.98s -> 7479.60s]  I'm gonna wait or I'm gonna stride right over to it. Can I do per?
[7483.42s -> 7488.98s]  No, but yeah, I can't do per I'm gonna just I'm gonna walk over to it
[7489.10s -> 7494.68s]  Throwing caution to the wind you step out of the shadows and approach the gate time to see if you have learned enough of
[7494.68s -> 7506.15s]  Your travels to go through the city and unlock the gate you reach the other side of the clearing unscathed and stand below the enormous door
[7508.11s -> 7509.77s]  recite the spell
[7509.79s -> 7518.74s]  Something something something something something something and the golem has armor you knock firmly on the door
[7519.00s -> 7522.56s]  When there is no response you call out I am here to open this gate
[7522.68s -> 7529.50s]  There is no response you begin to wonder if you have been tricked if there is no gate here at all
[7529.50s -> 7532.82s]  And it's simply an illusion painted across a solid stone wall
[7533.51s -> 7538.01s]  Suddenly you are not alone a phantom voice issues from the wood itself
[7538.01s -> 7543.40s]  Oh stranger, do you know the spell which controls the gate?
[7543.58s -> 7549.88s]  Uh, no, I do not
[7552.67s -> 7559.26s]  Then the gate denies you from across the clearing you hear a scrabbling sound of metal moving over stone
[7559.58s -> 7567.71s]  You look around but see nothing. Look at the shadows. Look along the track. Look at the well
[7568.13s -> 7573.86s]  You look over at the well and catch a flash of moonlight on a metal blade
[7574.02s -> 7576.93s]  It is the hooked claw of a grappling hook
[7576.93s -> 7581.40s]  Attached to the edge of the well shaft as you watch a face emerges
[7581.40s -> 7584.80s]  It bears the leering hook tooth smile of a goblin
[7584.88s -> 7590.33s]  The creature is climbing a rope with a grappling hook attached which is hooked over the lip of the well
[7591.63s -> 7596.78s]  Attack hide you turn to run aiming to find somewhere you can hide and watch what unfolds
[7596.78s -> 7600.92s]  But then you realize that you are running for your life as goblin after goblin
[7600.96s -> 7603.84s]  Clammers from the well and begins to race across the clearing towards you
[7603.84s -> 7606.05s]  There's no way you can fight a hundred goblins
[7606.05s -> 7615.20s]  So you dash aside into the shadows the goblins pour up to the gate are they going to try to ram it?
[7615.32s -> 7620.40s]  But then they stop and in their midst a small figure is being propelled forward
[7620.48s -> 7622.28s]  You cannot clearly see him
[7622.28s -> 7628.48s]  But he is wearing a dull metal circlet on his brow which he clutches as though it was keeping him safe
[7628.56s -> 7632.99s]  They're king perhaps but since when have goblins had a king
[7633.05s -> 7641.61s]  He is surrounded by a guard of nearby nearly 20 goblins as though he was indeed precious kill the figure
[7641.65s -> 7647.45s]  All right, let's go wherever this goblin king is he needs to be stopped. Oh
[7656.17s -> 7660.42s]  I had a grenade. There's a lava grenade over there. Uh
[7666.06s -> 7667.34s]  Yo
[7667.34s -> 7679.38s]  What happens here you cast the spell?
[7680.10s -> 7684.10s]  Throwing down a Giants tooth which erupts into smoke a moment later
[7684.10s -> 7690.70s]  A giant is standing in the middle of the clearing it grabs a fistful of goblins and tosses them away over the wall
[7690.78s -> 7695.10s]  Then grabs the goblin king in its fist and raises him up into the air
[7695.42s -> 7701.47s]  He looks to you for instructions toss him away crush him
[7702.47s -> 7715.51s]  Crush him crush him. Um, should I crush him? No, I can't I need to know who I need to get info
[7715.51s -> 7720.14s]  He I love that. He looks to you for instruction like um
[7720.66s -> 7732.14s]  Well, what do you want me to do with this guy put him down put him down you need to
[7732.82s -> 7740.30s]  You should put him down do a 1v1 PvP. Yeah, I can 1v1 PvP this guy think about that
[7740.34s -> 7744.98s]  I've got this giant here all the goblins are gonna fuck with me now
[7745.10s -> 7751.38s]  I'm gonna put him down put him down you call them the giant lowers the king back to the ground
[7751.62s -> 7757.46s]  It is enough for his goblin guards to react and they quickly surround him once more and push you back
[7757.74s -> 7764.52s]  More goblins charge the giant clamoring up him and working in a large group to cut his head from his shoulders
[7764.80s -> 7766.56s]  The kick shit we're gonna kill him
[7766.56s -> 7771.76s]  The king smiles holding the circle on his head as if it was a source of some kind of power and then he hurries to
[7771.76s -> 7777.87s]  The gate leaning down to the lock he whispers something but you cannot hear what he says a moment later
[7777.87s -> 7782.65s]  The gate begins to move it is opening run for the open gate
[7782.65s -> 7788.33s]  This is your chance to leave the city you rush forward chanting fearsome sounding
[7788.83s -> 7792.59s]  Liturgy at the top of your lungs to scare the goblins and clear them aside
[7792.83s -> 7797.35s]  You're nearly through when suddenly a great cry goes up from outside the walls
[7797.75s -> 7804.22s]  Something is moving out there run you keep pelting madly forward for once
[7804.56s -> 7810.36s]  Simply running madly and not waiting to look around you are almost through the gates when you see what is out there an
[7811.12s -> 7813.12s]  army of marsh goblins
[7813.20s -> 7815.36s]  thousands of them fully armed and
[7816.04s -> 7822.96s]  Stampeding into Carré keep going you try to fight your way forward
[7823.00s -> 7826.88s]  But the invading army pushes you back with a force like an oncoming tide
[7827.12s -> 7832.45s]  That sweeps you off your feet and dumps you on the other side of the clearing the incoming
[7832.45s -> 7837.37s]  Goblins spill through the gate filling the clearing and meeting their hill cousins in a loud and violent
[7837.73s -> 7844.75s]  Celebration the man with the circlet at the gate cries with glee a new day for Carré begins
[7844.75s -> 7849.39s]  He cries clamoring onto the shoulders of a nearby goblin as though about to make a speech
[7849.55s -> 7857.56s]  Quite suddenly the goblins that are carrying him let go he cries out as he falls to the ground a sword goes up
[7858.84s -> 7863.56s]  Slashing down there is a scream. They have murdered their own king
[7863.68s -> 7872.58s]  What is going on here the circlet from his head rolls to your feet the goblins clashing sword on shield look towards the city with
[7872.58s -> 7877.80s]  Violent eyes take the circlet from the way the king was clutching the circlet
[7877.80s -> 7881.61s]  You might have thought it was a thing of power perhaps akin to the crown of king itself
[7881.61s -> 7887.49s]  But it is nothing cheap hammered iron it still bears the groove
[7887.81s -> 7896.55s]  From when it was once a goblin sword you toss it into the dust go for the gate their attack on Carré is not your concern
[7896.83s -> 7905.85s]  Darting forward through the crowd of creatures you hurt you head for the open gate and the backlands you run for the gate
[7905.85s -> 7910.11s]  But your progress is slow goblins are surging in and they are starting to organize
[7910.67s -> 7916.64s]  One a leader of some kind is hoisted up by the others so he can address the crowd
[7923.59s -> 7930.42s]  Suddenly the goblins eyes are turning on you as if they had not seen you before one springs forward
[7930.56s -> 7934.60s]  But there are a hundred more behind
[7935.12s -> 7947.05s]  You ready your sword the creature rushes towards you you try to gauge his size and make a play for the creature's chest the
[7947.05s -> 7951.52s]  Goblin drops back quivering with fear shows his teeth and spits
[7954.81s -> 7962.73s]  Put him down. I haven't gotten over the fact that they cut the Giants head off. That was horrible. That was a lot going on there
[7963.25s -> 7967.52s]  um
[7967.52s -> 7972.61s]  Crushed him even they were gonna kill him anyways. They would have been happy
[7973.17s -> 7985.94s]  They definitely it doesn't matter all right all right all right you had a full blast. We're gonna go for
[7988.75s -> 7990.75s]  shit
[7990.75s -> 7993.50s]  He's not gonna go full blast
[7993.78s -> 7996.61s]  We do it again
[7996.61s -> 8009.17s]  Fuck sorry do it again. Oh my god one point eight one point nine get out of here with this bullshit die
[8012.15s -> 8015.30s]  shameful oh
[8015.30s -> 8024.32s]  God damn it. Okay. All right all right all right. Oh come on the other one attacked immediately
[8025.08s -> 8048.57s]  No, oh my fucking god. I why did I hate the deep and deep and deep and deep and deep and deep and
[8049.21s -> 8050.93s]  Start over again. I don't care
[8050.93s -> 8052.09s]  Tell me
[8052.09s -> 8071.24s]  He's he's he's going to go full the Goblin hefts its sword, but it looks a little tired
[8071.96s -> 8073.58s]  six
[8073.58s -> 8077.68s]  Yeah, all right. That's good. We're good. We're good good now. We go full blast
[8080.63s -> 8082.63s]  Come on like you gotta be shitting me
[8083.47s -> 8084.59s]  Really?
[8084.59s -> 8090.47s]  My god you beat me by point one what the fuck
[8091.07s -> 8093.95s]  That's such dog shit. That's dog shit
[8094.57s -> 8103.60s]  Okay, it stares at your stance
[8103.88s -> 8110.64s]  six oh
[8110.64s -> 8112.00s]  Fuck off
[8112.00s -> 8124.76s]  All right, we're doing low three. How did you get four? He just did his whole bar excuse me. You did your entire bar
[8125.48s -> 8129.32s]  What's that? What are you talking about? How did he get the four Santa points? He did his whole bar
[8130.08s -> 8133.85s]  Yeah, it is sit the fuck down
[8135.17s -> 8146.21s]  More goblins are appearing I can run you cannot keep this up
[8146.41s -> 8153.16s]  Wave after wave of goblin is filling the yard you cannot hope to kill them all with just your sword
[8153.32s -> 8157.00s]  You turn and race away into the shadows then a voice rings out
[8157.60s -> 8170.79s]  Stop there is a better way you look around but can see no one but all around you something is happening
[8170.79s -> 8176.73s]  It is as though the goblins have slowed down their warmongering becoming an absurd stately dance
[8176.93s -> 8180.12s]  The noise in the clearing dulls to a low rumble
[8180.12s -> 8190.53s]  I command you to stop from the smoke of the torches by the gate a figure emerges
[8190.65s -> 8198.30s]  It is an old man with a long beard and deep black iris eyes
[8198.62s -> 8204.43s]  He paces through the churning goblin army to stand in the open his legs disappear into a spectral trail
[8204.61s -> 8210.81s]  He is at least part Wraith step forward he commands and you find yourself
[8211.37s -> 8224.68s]  Bidden the goblins seem to part around you like smoke as you approach the figure. I have aligned three stars
[8225.28s -> 8234.11s]  Vic rises tonight the goblins show their hand tonight, but also you you are here tonight
[8234.47s -> 8243.23s]  My name is Lorag I was once a scholar and a noble of the city later
[8243.23s -> 8256.87s]  I founded it you founded it later. Who is this crazed shade? I saw Kari was falling
[8257.69s -> 8264.98s]  Sansus had lost his mind and sided with the goblins council was in ruins my life
[8265.14s -> 8270.20s]  My own life was threatened. I saw that Kari needed to be saved
[8270.44s -> 8281.52s]  So I went back to remake it in a way that could be saved and here we are now
[8281.68s -> 8286.60s]  You've been here two days. I've been here hundreds of years
[8287.81s -> 8290.37s]  Waiting for you to bring me the spell for the gate
[8293.42s -> 8298.86s]  The gate is already open the goblins opened it their leader did
[8300.82s -> 8307.80s]  The spell does not open the gate his tone is heavy and dark like tarred timber
[8307.88s -> 8313.55s]  The spell controls it and there are deep matrix burned into the wood itself
[8316.16s -> 8318.16s]  Drupi dog
[8322.31s -> 8323.59s]  Drupi the dog
[8323.59s -> 8331.12s]  Burned you know god damn it fuck. I don't care burned into the wood itself
[8332.25s -> 8334.37s]  Magics that have poisoned the city and burnt
[8335.65s -> 8342.84s]  Into the eyeballs of those who live nearby he stares at you his cold black eyes expressing no emotion
[8342.96s -> 8347.80s]  The magics I placed there to be used by you
[8348.32s -> 8356.48s]  Tonight I am dead. You must act for me. How can I find the spell lines?
[8358.47s -> 8360.11s]  I tried to find them. They were well
[8360.11s -> 8369.07s]  They were too hidden the lines are known to four nobles or theta is blind and living in the wastelands of upper Kari
[8369.47s -> 8376.94s]  But malice was a follower of the gods slang and in his shrine near the docks of lower Kari
[8377.18s -> 8383.08s]  You may learn his line as for my line. I give it to you freely
[8384.52s -> 8394.01s]  Tumblers to seals deep inside, but there's no more time. It's too late
[8394.25s -> 8398.52s]  There is a magic that will give you the time you need
[8398.92s -> 8404.92s]  I cast it on myself once and went far back to before this city was built
[8404.92s -> 8408.72s]  I found it Kari now you will save it
[8408.76s -> 8414.54s]  He waits to let his words sink in if you will allow me
[8414.54s -> 8422.36s]  I will blend time itself so that you may return to the city and find the spell for the gate
[8422.50s -> 8428.50s]  So shall you take the adventure or will you leave Kari to burn?
[8429.82s -> 8438.06s]  Understand I will curse you and the journey to follow if you do not assist me you hesitate
[8438.54s -> 8443.46s]  Kari is a city of traps, but also of secrets. There's still more that you might find
[8443.62s -> 8456.10s]  Can you afford to let the city burn so this is what happens if I say?
[8456.50s -> 8464.61s]  Yes, continue the search we go boom and the whole map is reset
[8464.83s -> 8471.16s]  We go back to the very beginning we can then go and pass we did not go and get the actual lines
[8471.52s -> 8477.50s]  To open the door we can do that we can do the whole thing again, and we can go find the lines or
[8478.06s -> 8480.62s]  We can just leave Kari
[8480.70s -> 8484.17s]  We don't you don't need the lines you don't have to get the spell lines
[8484.37s -> 8493.47s]  But if you do leave Kari, and you say I don't care let the place burn let the goblins kill it Lorag
[8494.99s -> 8499.97s]  Becomes your god, and you can never replace him, and he's a piece of shit
[8500.01s -> 8512.78s]  That's what we're dealing with here should we try to save the city or do we just keep going say fuck it move on?
[8512.92s -> 8514.42s]  That's spoilers
[8514.42s -> 8523.24s]  I mean it's a pretty important spoiler that if we just leave we leave and if we and that
[8523.56s -> 8531.74s]  That's a very important spoiler, but doing going rewinding and going back to the beginning
[8532.12s -> 8534.66s]  Yeah, it means there's more content here
[8534.66s -> 8540.50s]  But we do have to play through and find them and if we don't find them through the second time if we don't get the other
[8540.50s -> 8542.28s]  two lines
[8542.28s -> 8547.96s]  Then we get back here, and he's just like yeah, fuck you you can't do it, and we just leave and it's over anyways
[8548.08s -> 8556.52s]  I'm gonna leave it up to you guys. Let's put a poll in the chat
[8557.47s -> 8562.59s]  By the way abandoned car we go on to the third episode we go on to the third game
[8562.59s -> 8570.42s]  So this is either stay in episode 2 or move on to episode 3 with some repercussions
[8570.50s -> 8587.39s]  What do you think go back save the city get that go get the spell lines because we have some clues now
[8587.39s -> 8595.13s]  Or just let's go and move on to the next game. We can do it. We can do it
[8595.21s -> 8616.54s]  Okay back to the future. We need to get that legendary sword. Did you would you last time I?
[8617.40s -> 8619.68s]  Abandoned car a last time that's what I did last time
[8619.68s -> 8622.74s]  I just walked through and I said fuck it whatever
[8623.50s -> 8626.10s]  And live with the repercussions for the rest of the game
[8626.14s -> 8632.57s]  We did not go back and get the lines last time yes
[8632.57s -> 8638.45s]  You keep everything you keep all of your items you keep all your money literally nothing changes besides you go back to the very beginning
[8638.61s -> 8640.65s]  Here or actually maybe here
[8640.65s -> 8646.82s]  I forget where they put you but then we can use the clues to go and find
[8646.94s -> 8655.76s]  The two places where we need to find the lines because Lorag just gave us his all right. Yeah, we're going back all right
[8656.84s -> 8668.32s]  Let us go back continue the search. I will help you. I thank you ready yourself
[8668.38s -> 8675.79s]  He raises his arm and begins the spell the raging goblins stand like statues
[8675.87s -> 8682.73s]  You feel yourself lifting up from your body as though you've been snatched away by birdmen as you lift into the air you hear
[8682.73s -> 8684.97s]  Lorag cry out one last piece of advice
[8685.41s -> 8690.80s]  Find the lines and find the order of the lines
[8691.40s -> 8696.23s]  Karate dwindles beneath you and you feel your body growing weaker oh
[8700.40s -> 8711.56s]  You get to decide where to go all right all right. What are the clues? What are the clues?
[8712.12s -> 8723.92s]  You were given a clue about the backlands for sleeping okay now. That's the backlands of the next episode
[8724.82s -> 8731.62s]  Lord malice Lord malice is one of the nobles of Kari, but where is he okay?
[8731.62s -> 8733.62s]  Lord theta is in the ruins
[8734.14s -> 8738.78s]  What theta can be found blind and begging in the ruins of the fallen quarter of the city?
[8739.14s -> 8744.52s]  Was the fallen quarter of the city
[8749.81s -> 8750.93s]  Fallen quarter
[8750.93s -> 8762.26s]  What was the other one priest at the shrine of slang might be able to help you find the spell lines the gate the shrine is
[8762.26s -> 8774.36s]  Located between the well and the docks in lower Kari so the well and the docks of lower Kari which is
[8774.88s -> 8802.97s]  Here or here it literally says the well was is between the well yeah lower Kari though where we drop in
[8802.97s -> 8814.87s]  Yeah, but where do you want to go first should we go to the well? Yeah?
[8814.87s -> 8824.63s]  It's right here. There were yes. We get to go back in time all right
[8824.63s -> 8828.55s]  You get what I guess it really doesn't matter because that way we can go back twice all right, so we're gonna
[8828.55s -> 8829.75s]  Go here you ready
[8829.75s -> 8841.30s]  We got to go find who we're looking for shrine of slang located between the well
[8841.30s -> 8855.00s]  We don't look at the shrine of slang or go to the festival
[8855.00s -> 8860.44s]  I guess we could go here and go up through the festival if you wanted to see the festival
[8860.44s -> 8868.04s]  I have literally one health. Oh, hey, maybe that's something you do in your game. Maybe you do your game
[8868.16s -> 8873.71s]  Maybe you go to them. Maybe you go do all this we didn't do any of this fallen quarters down here
[8873.79s -> 8886.19s]  So we've we would need to start how would we get over here all right whole time are we gonna do be like?
[8886.81s -> 8889.69s]  festivals festival into the fall and quarter or
[8891.27s -> 8900.84s]  Well to go to the shrine because I'm imagining it's probably an opportunity for us to go like this
[8901.24s -> 8903.73s]  Right or even go like this
[8903.73s -> 8905.93s]  That's possible, too
[8905.93s -> 8911.89s]  This just kind of skips us over here and goes a wham and we might be able to go wham wham
[8912.09s -> 8921.98s]  Ready when I start the fields of the well we might we probably can get both if we go from yeah
[8921.98s -> 8923.98s]  We can probably go
[8924.50s -> 8926.50s]  Or if we start here we can go
[8928.94s -> 8948.57s]  Now let me get a poll in chat. I'm gonna say well or fields where we gone. Oh, it's already with okay
[8948.57s -> 8977.86s]  It's already there fields well this does not count as a rewind it does not okay, okay?
[8978.02s -> 8984.58s]  It's still not it's pretty close. I'm
[8996.31s -> 9017.56s]  Going in five seconds. I don't think it's still it's only it's like 200 votes. That's not that much okay? That's it
[9017.60s -> 9022.18s]  We're going to the fields three two one
[9032.79s -> 9039.21s]  Like penis music you are being wretched in directions
[9039.21s -> 9042.37s]  You did not know existed the pain is unbearable
[9042.37s -> 9046.06s]  And just when you think you will go mad from it the forces tear you apart
[9046.50s -> 9051.48s]  You struggle to grab onto your belongings in your very self as you tumble down from the clouds
[9051.48s -> 9060.22s]  And then you are awake your eyes open once more your surroundings have changed you wake click you wake quickly from sleep
[9060.26s -> 9062.50s]  Your journey must continue
[9062.50s -> 9068.38s]  There's no time to lose following the track for a few minutes you reach a junction where three roads begin
[9068.46s -> 9070.62s]  These are the outskirts of caray
[9070.62s -> 9076.73s]  That's huddled like beggars on either side of the tracks leading uphill into the city port time to choose your road
[9077.07s -> 9082.33s]  Somewhere in the city must be the information you need to find the spell lines for the north gate that the innkeeper told you
[9082.33s -> 9088.46s]  About just at that moment a cart rolls down the road from the right and careens around a corner to take the main track ahead
[9088.90s -> 9095.68s]  This time however the crates on it wobble, but do not fall and it disappears up the road leaving nothing behind
[9096.70s -> 9107.80s]  Interesting it seems not everything is fixed after all remember when we got the blimberry juice. It's different. It's different
[9109.65s -> 9120.50s]  Speaking of that I need to drink something. I am I look at my health. I mean I'm just gonna take them both I
[9121.06s -> 9124.47s]  Need them both
[9124.47s -> 9129.27s]  All right, so you guys wanted to go towards the festival right? Oh?
[9131.94s -> 9133.94s]  Shit, I didn't want to do I didn't want to drink them both
[9134.48s -> 9149.85s]  Yeah, I should I should that was my mistake. That's a mistake rewind. That's a mistake rewind cuz I can do the doc's bill, okay?
[9150.65s -> 9158.05s]  Let's head towards the festival we need to end up in the fallen quarter or up at uh up at the well here
[9158.21s -> 9160.40s]  So we've got to find our way up
[9160.40s -> 9172.50s]  We're gonna go to the festival you head right along a wide track until you reach a large hut
[9172.50s -> 9178.21s]  It is the only building on this path that is still standing either side are empty plots
[9178.45s -> 9184.34s]  Once the houses of the farmers who planted the fields to the north and now collapsed and thick with grip weed
[9184.46s -> 9186.98s]  It seems that here in the shadow of the city wall
[9187.10s -> 9195.07s]  It's not a place people choose to live by the side of the door by the side of the door to the hut is a sign
[9196.02s -> 9203.18s]  Delicately painted chainmaker the door is just a crack a jar and from within you hear a gentle tinkling sound
[9203.62s -> 9213.66s]  Metal on metal as though a creature in a chainmail dress was endlessly pacing the floor listen at the door
[9213.94s -> 9216.92s]  You pause a moment longer and listen closely to the door
[9217.28s -> 9220.26s]  But there are no voices or footsteps from within just the sound of the chains
[9220.54s -> 9229.49s]  From somewhere further on comes the falling and rising sound of a crowd some kind of event is taking place
[9229.61s -> 9237.92s]  There are several places you could go next so we could uh, we're not going this way
[9238.24s -> 9243.69s]  So it's either go into the chainmaker hut cut through the fields or walk on the path
[9244.21s -> 9259.58s]  Let's go in here. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go to the chainmaker you push open the hut door and enter
[9259.70s -> 9265.48s]  It is dark inside the floor is sawdust and the air smells of oil
[9265.48s -> 9272.12s]  Oil polish and burnt metal from the ceiling hanging like ivy are metal chains of all lengths and thickness
[9272.48s -> 9279.72s]  Some suitable for machinery some for oxygen and others for arms and feet the chains shift and whisper to themselves
[9279.76s -> 9285.20s]  There seems to be no one here. There's another room beyond its door is hanging open
[9285.44s -> 9295.35s]  Call out a greeting search the room. Try the far door
[9300.13s -> 9304.32s]  Hello, I'm here
[9304.32s -> 9309.54s]  BDSM house try the far door
[9311.99s -> 9315.51s]  Let's get some loot. No shop owner and car
[9315.51s -> 9317.51s]  I should leave their wares unattended
[9317.51s -> 9323.30s]  Steal from him would be to teach him a lesson you begin to carefully search the room trying not to set the chains to
[9323.30s -> 9335.40s]  Rattling now a god left wall under the table far door
[9335.88s -> 9337.89s]  Near the door to the shop
[9337.89s -> 9347.03s]  I'm gonna say near the door to the shop searching around near the door to the shop
[9347.03s -> 9353.11s]  You find a copper key. It is carefully stashed into a crack in the wall as though secret and valuable
[9353.11s -> 9362.44s]  It is far too small to be the key to the shop door you take it and put it in your pack nice nice
[9366.42s -> 9367.22s]  um
[9367.22s -> 9386.15s]  Under the table or just stop I'm gonna get caught. Why am I doing the same thing? I did earlier
[9386.15s -> 9387.63s]  I never went I didn't go down here
[9387.63s -> 9393.50s]  You mean the place right that from like five years ago did I do the same thing?
[9393.50s -> 9406.48s]  We haven't been here in this playthrough search along the wall as you move across the room
[9406.48s -> 9411.64s]  You stumble clumsily into a chain and it begins to swing hitting other chains on either side
[9411.64s -> 9418.16s]  The far door opens in a spin a man orc from Torrapani appears and it looks like he is angry
[9418.32s -> 9425.04s]  The chain maker growls fiercely and snatches up a particularly heavy length of metal holding it like it was a thread
[9426.53s -> 9428.53s]  Talk my way out of this
[9428.61s -> 9438.29s]  What can we do?
[9438.29s -> 9444.26s]  sharpen blade
[9444.26s -> 9446.26s]  I mean I could throw a fireball at the guy
[9450.04s -> 9451.40s]  fix
[9451.40s -> 9453.40s]  Cause fixness. Oh
[9458.31s -> 9459.27s]  mud
[9459.27s -> 9464.68s]  quicksand
[9464.68s -> 9466.68s]  I'm gonna I'm gonna talk my way out of it
[9466.76s -> 9476.74s]  I'm gonna talk my way out of it. I don't I don't have enough. Look at my stamina. I'm not stealing from you
[9477.14s -> 9483.67s]  You reply calmly I called out, but you didn't hear me. I heard nothing
[9485.52s -> 9495.59s]  Exactly the chain maker stops and thinks about this. I understand. All right, you want chains
[9498.18s -> 9503.01s]  It worked look for a chain to buy he's worthless
[9503.09s -> 9503.41s]  All right
[9503.41s -> 9506.02s]  What do you got?
[9506.02s -> 9512.63s]  You look around the shop a chain after unremarkable chain then one stands out a short length of silver
[9513.11s -> 9519.19s]  Which seems to move more energetically than the one swaying on either side the chain maker nods good chain
[9519.67s -> 9525.97s]  Magic chain, what does it do magic?
[9528.93s -> 9541.19s]  How much does it cost he sizes you up thinking you must be wealthy. It's five gold pieces. I'll take it
[9541.43s -> 9548.82s]  I'll buy it you hand over the five gold pieces. He wants happy that three of those five pieces are his anyway
[9551.41s -> 9556.82s]  Oh, yeah, that's right. You shake the chain maker's hand and take the chain
[9557.22s -> 9561.86s]  It is clearly enchanted the ends seem to snap and bite at one another like a snake
[9563.86s -> 9566.48s]  Good for taking out their knees
[9566.56s -> 9582.44s]  Okay, is this a weapon it is a weapon really that's all right. That's cool
[9585.96s -> 9587.16s]  We have a
[9587.16s -> 9593.99s]  Chain as a weapon though. Okay
[9593.99s -> 9598.50s]  Uh, should I cut through the field or should I just walk on the road? I'm gonna walk on the road, right?
[9599.14s -> 9604.42s]  I don't have enough health to like step on a beehive or land in a trap or something
[9604.66s -> 9616.44s]  I'm gonna take the road you continue along the road land rises gently
[9617.09s -> 9621.33s]  Thin meager scrub broken by rocky outcrops like teeth through an infant's gum
[9622.02s -> 9626.02s]  Goats roam the slopes paranoid shifty creatures who flee at the sound of your footsteps
[9626.58s -> 9633.14s]  Suddenly you could be back in the fields outside kristin tonti. This part of the city port is barely habited
[9633.54s -> 9636.10s]  So you're unlikely to find clues to the north gate spell here
[9636.88s -> 9639.12s]  There will be more people to talk to near the docks
[9639.52s -> 9644.92s]  You continue walking along the track and begin to hear the sound of a large crowd up ahead
[9645.24s -> 9648.76s]  There's some kind of market or fair happening further on near the river
[9649.16s -> 9652.20s]  You pass a dirt track on the left that leads away across the field
[9652.52s -> 9660.12s]  Yeah, we'll head right you guys wanted to we wanted to the festival we're gonna do the festival
[9666.45s -> 9672.29s]  You continue along the road towards the noise after a few minutes. You are walking between tall poles and rippling colored flags
[9672.93s -> 9674.45s]  people and creatures
[9674.45s -> 9679.89s]  Sprawl across the path and several tents have been erected the poles joined together by more flags
[9681.17s -> 9683.73s]  You ease your way into the edge of the gathered crowd. It looks
[9684.37s -> 9689.49s]  All good spirited and fun and with so many people here. Perhaps you will pick up useful information about the spell lines
[9692.08s -> 9696.29s]  Listen you mill through the crowd keeping your ears open for anything interesting
[9696.61s -> 9699.65s]  But most people in the center of the field are arguing over where to go next
[9700.05s -> 9705.25s]  Or lamenting how many gold pieces they have spent you might do better to have a closer look at something
[9707.41s -> 9709.41s]  Okay, this is through the end of the midway
[9713.54s -> 9718.82s]  You walk to the south end of the fairground midway a boy with a barrel stands off to one side
[9719.46s -> 9721.46s]  There are more exciting stalls further north
[9723.88s -> 9725.56s]  barrel boy
[9725.56s -> 9727.56s]  Or in the middle of the midway
[9727.96s -> 9736.84s]  I mean barrel boy, right?
[9736.84s -> 9739.90s]  You approach a boy standing by a barrel and looking sheepish
[9743.57s -> 9749.12s]  What are you selling the boy points into his barrel but doesn't answer
[9751.49s -> 9753.09s]  Look in the barrel
[9753.09s -> 9756.05s]  You peer into the barrel. It is full of small hard apples
[9756.53s -> 9758.53s]  Most are blackened by disease
[9759.17s -> 9761.57s]  Or else are shot through with maggot holes
[9763.56s -> 9766.02s]  Your apples are all rotten
[9766.02s -> 9767.70s]  The boy shakes his head
[9767.70s -> 9772.02s]  Then picks one up from the barrel he squeezes it hard in his fist, but nothing happens
[9772.66s -> 9775.03s]  And he drops it sharply back into the bucket
[9779.38s -> 9783.11s]  uh
[9783.11s -> 9786.24s]  Um, why don't you speak?
[9786.40s -> 9789.65s]  The boy shrugs but doesn't seem to want to answer properly
[9791.04s -> 9792.98s]  How much is an apple?
[9792.98s -> 9796.50s]  You ask despite the fact that it's hard to imagine anyone paying for one
[9797.30s -> 9801.78s]  The boy holds up a single finger with one hand and all five fingers of the other
[9804.55s -> 9806.55s]  One gold for five apples
[9807.51s -> 9812.44s]  The boy nods
[9813.16s -> 9814.98s]  Five
[9814.98s -> 9816.26s]  I'll take it
[9816.26s -> 9819.30s]  You hand over a gold piece and the boy supplies you with five apples
[9821.20s -> 9823.76s]  In your hands you feel that they are indeed not rotten
[9824.24s -> 9828.08s]  In fact, they are rock solid hardened by some disease into stones
[9829.06s -> 9831.06s]  The boy bows his head in thanks
[9831.62s -> 9833.62s]  And then gestures behind him
[9833.62s -> 9838.50s]  A girl possibly his sister pops up from behind another barrel and pulls a face at you
[9840.84s -> 9842.84s]  Throw an apple at her
[9844.34s -> 9849.14s]  Like I just full baseball pitcher throw this into this girl's face
[9852.58s -> 9854.58s]  Why would I do that? That's horrible
[9858.32s -> 9861.04s]  I'm gonna cause mayhem if I do that, you know that right?
[9863.65s -> 9865.65s]  Stick my tongue out. Yeah, i'm gonna go
[9868.29s -> 9871.49s]  Guys i'm not baseball throwing a rock at a little girl's head
[9872.44s -> 9875.96s]  I'm, sorry you you have a playthrough you can do that in your playthrough. That's not happening here
[9878.21s -> 9881.89s]  I am not going to full baseball pitcher from the mound
[9882.45s -> 9887.25s]  Throw one foot away from me a rock into at some at some girl. I'm not doing that
[9887.97s -> 9890.52s]  I'm, sorry
[9890.52s -> 9902.36s]  You did it last time
[9903.24s -> 9906.12s]  You stick your tongue out the girl giggles and then dodges behind the barrel
[9906.60s -> 9909.40s]  The boy looks at you expectantly the girl peeks up again
[9910.84s -> 9912.84s]  I'm waiting for her head to pick up
[9914.13s -> 9915.57s]  Is that your sister?
[9915.57s -> 9917.57s]  You ask pointing the girl's direction
[9917.73s -> 9921.33s]  Boy nods and then takes an apple from his barrel and throws it across the field
[9921.81s -> 9923.81s]  His sister dodges quickly out of the way
[9933.97s -> 9938.77s]  You lob one of your apples at the girl, but she dives to one side and it misses the boy claps his hands
[9939.41s -> 9942.05s]  The girl sticks her arms out at either side then quickly ducks
[9945.30s -> 9947.94s]  You ready your second apple and wait for the girl to show herself
[9948.34s -> 9951.78s]  As soon as she pops up you throw but your aim is off and you miss by a finger's breath
[9952.10s -> 9954.10s]  The girl giggles and ducks away out of sight
[9958.56s -> 9966.20s]  I I've I didn't mean to do that. I was trying to throw it again. I've can I rewind I fucked up
[9967.01s -> 9969.81s]  It's waste i'm wasting apples. I'm I want all five apples
[9976.20s -> 9978.20s]  Wait, I toss them all into the mud
[9979.70s -> 9983.22s]  You walk away as you go you try biting into an apple and almost crack one of your teeth
[9983.70s -> 9986.10s]  They're completely inedible. You toss all of them into the mud
[9988.60s -> 9990.20s]  What no go back
[9990.20s -> 10003.36s]  Go back go back go back
[10003.36s -> 10008.45s]  Six gold pieces one piece for five apples. Okay. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go
[10010.21s -> 10012.16s]  Stick my tongue out
[10012.16s -> 10013.92s]  Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[10013.92s -> 10016.39s]  All right. Here we go, bro
[10016.39s -> 10017.96s]  Throw another
[10017.96s -> 10021.88s]  Okay, throw another you try another throw, but your aim is really terrible
[10022.28s -> 10028.28s]  Perhaps if you spent more time practicing your sword fighting and physical skills and less learning book magic your arm would be better
[10029.08s -> 10032.44s]  Your hand you hand back your remaining blackened apples to the boy
[10033.00s -> 10036.36s]  He grabs the apples and throws them at his sister and you walk back into the midway
[10037.16s -> 10038.04s]  what
[10038.04s -> 10043.83s]  The fair spreads out all around you a collection of booths and what I is that a like a strength check
[10044.39s -> 10048.68s]  I don't get it. I just wasted a dollar
[10051.04s -> 10054.10s]  There's just a hint of violence and an atmosphere of cheerfulness
[10057.36s -> 10058.48s]  what
[10058.48s -> 10061.75s]  All those fancy books
[10061.83s -> 10069.16s]  All right into the midway
[10069.16s -> 10073.48s]  You push your way through the crowds to the very heart of the fair and look around at the attractions to offer
[10076.29s -> 10078.77s]  A beer tent the dancing bear
[10079.33s -> 10084.12s]  Let's go to the beer tent
[10084.12s -> 10087.16s]  Just by the river is a low tent surrounded by several stumbling figures
[10087.72s -> 10093.48s]  It could almost be a tent for dancing except for the strong smell of brewed grain that drifts over the air
[10094.36s -> 10099.88s]  In the stall a group of three half goblin women are pouring mugs of beer and talking to the locals
[10100.44s -> 10105.08s]  The sign reads one mug one gold four mugs six gold
[10109.30s -> 10114.61s]  That's doesn't make any sense
[10114.61s -> 10119.97s]  Smell the air you pause to inhale the rich smell of brewed grains that hangs around the tent
[10120.53s -> 10122.29s]  It is quite nourishing
[10122.29s -> 10124.29s]  One of the bar women catches your smile
[10128.08s -> 10129.52s]  Nice. Yes
[10129.52s -> 10132.72s]  Even nicer in a glass
[10132.72s -> 10136.56s]  Tall spiny creature raises his voice to announce. He is buying four mugs
[10137.30s -> 10139.48s]  A huge cheer goes up
[10139.48s -> 10141.48s]  But mostly from the women behind the bar
[10148.36s -> 10155.80s]  Um, I don't know. I'm gonna run out of money
[10156.28s -> 10162.20s]  You elbow your way to the bar and wave to attract the attention of one of the women
[10164.21s -> 10166.39s]  Gradients, what can I do for you?
[10168.37s -> 10172.29s]  Uh, what's on sale? I'll buy some beer. Why are four mugs so expensive?
[10173.33s -> 10175.81s]  You ask isn't it cheaper to buy four separately?
[10177.09s -> 10182.21s]  Oh, no, no, no, it's a special offer you say four mugs for six gold pieces
[10187.20s -> 10190.29s]  That's but that's more than buying separately
[10193.41s -> 10194.61s]  Oh
[10194.61s -> 10198.61s]  I see your mistake. It's a common one. We should fix the sign
[10199.25s -> 10202.66s]  But she doesn't explain she quickly disappears to serve another customer
[10204.39s -> 10206.39s]  Just then two creatures walk past
[10208.08s -> 10210.72s]  So you say he wasn't dead when they buried him?
[10211.36s -> 10212.96s]  This is the first
[10212.96s -> 10215.84s]  Not quite dead enough undead. You could talk to him
[10222.10s -> 10224.10s]  You move away from the tent to listen to the creatures
[10225.41s -> 10226.93s]  nobles
[10226.93s -> 10229.25s]  Why can't they just stay dead when they get dead?
[10230.21s -> 10231.57s]  Couldn't agree more
[10231.57s -> 10235.97s]  But at least they bury him anyway one less noble for the boss to worry about
[10236.90s -> 10241.11s]  They disappear into the crowd a stocky dwarf knocks into you briefly
[10241.91s -> 10244.87s]  Begging your pardon. He murmurs before slipping away into the crowd
[10247.75s -> 10249.91s]  He just took like I stole me. I got robbed
[10256.42s -> 10259.30s]  I don't want I don't remember what this does. I'm fine
[10260.10s -> 10264.47s]  You head back over to the tent and wait for a goblin s
[10265.43s -> 10267.43s]  I'll buy four you say
[10267.59s -> 10273.27s]  The half goblin woman returns with a grin and raises a cry as you pay six gold pieces and she pulls the drinks
[10275.78s -> 10277.70s]  He's buying four
[10277.70s -> 10280.26s]  Another lucky customer taking advantage of our offer
[10281.14s -> 10283.14s]  nearby drunks turn their heads
[10287.86s -> 10288.90s]  um
[10288.90s -> 10296.31s]  So just share it with everybody. I'll share them you tell the surrounding crowd
[10297.03s -> 10299.03s]  The woman behind the bar nods and murmurs
[10299.84s -> 10303.36s]  Good idea. This stuff's a bit too strong to drink a lot of
[10304.34s -> 10320.07s]  She sets down four mugs in front of you. Should I just drink them all? They're all laughing at you
[10330.60s -> 10334.28s]  I don't did I do this last time? I don't drink i'm gonna drink them all
[10335.26s -> 10340.96s]  Selfishly you knock back the first mug then the second then the third and fourth without sharing the mugs around
[10341.60s -> 10343.60s]  Despite buying them on offer
[10344.40s -> 10349.20s]  Beer is watery and somewhat unpleasant, but you don't really notice the ill effects until a few minutes have passed
[10350.00s -> 10352.48s]  Suddenly your head is swimming and your stomach is turning over
[10353.97s -> 10358.13s]  I had two more chat view. Well, why don't you settle your stomach with another?
[10360.26s -> 10362.98s]  I feel terrible. You've poisoned me sure
[10364.15s -> 10368.55s]  Too far under the influence to not to agree you buy another mug of beer and drain it
[10369.03s -> 10370.87s]  Now you feel really bad
[10370.87s -> 10374.71s]  And your head and stomach are swirling like you've been faced down in a cesspool
[10375.51s -> 10380.23s]  As you staggered away from the hut stumbling over your feet you look back and see a wide pipe
[10380.87s -> 10384.95s]  Running from the back of the tent and directly into the jibaji river
[10385.91s -> 10389.75s]  The last thing you realize is that the beer isn't beer at all, but river water
[10390.39s -> 10394.04s]  You've been poisoned with river water. I'm dead
[10404.12s -> 10410.84s]  I'll drink them all i'll drink them all and they're all mine. They're all my beers. Nobody can have them
[10412.53s -> 10419.76s]  And they're all like dude. All right, go for it. Oh my god. He actually bought four
[10421.08s -> 10423.08s]  Yeah, fuck you. I'm drinking them all
[10424.42s -> 10430.74s]  Yeah, but what smelling the air is delicious, but apparently so what what am I smelling that heals me for one health?
[10433.84s -> 10438.32s]  I'm gonna buy one mug
[10438.32s -> 10442.72s]  Paying a gold piece you buy a frothing mug of beer. The air looks muddy and somewhat disgusting
[10442.72s -> 10444.48s]  It doesn't taste like beer at all
[10444.48s -> 10448.48s]  This isn't beer
[10448.48s -> 10450.48s]  Excuse me. Uh, what is this?
[10451.54s -> 10455.38s]  Finest beer from her expression. She isn't telling the whole truth
[10456.71s -> 10459.97s]  You drink some
[10459.97s -> 10462.93s]  Oh, I wish I could but I can't drink while working
[10464.20s -> 10467.88s]  Yes, then another customer rolls up his nose bright red and his eyes soggy
[10469.27s -> 10470.39s]  I'll
[10470.39s -> 10472.15s]  Buy it for you
[10472.15s -> 10474.71s]  He puts 10 gold pieces down on the counter
[10475.89s -> 10478.93s]  enough for all six of you behind the bar
[10479.65s -> 10481.25s]  To you he remarks
[10481.25s -> 10483.19s]  cannily
[10483.19s -> 10486.15s]  Three sets of twins remarkable, isn't it?
[10486.71s -> 10488.71s]  Steal the money and run out of the league
[10489.84s -> 10491.84s]  Make her drink some
[10493.54s -> 10497.38s]  No, no, no, no, excuse me. Excuse me miss to have some of that have some
[10498.79s -> 10502.21s]  Have some
[10502.21s -> 10504.23s]  Please please have some
[10504.23s -> 10508.55s]  It's your beer. It's delicious. I by the way when I took that sip, I was just kidding
[10508.63s -> 10512.63s]  It's the it's delicious. You should you should have you take a sip have some take a sip of your own beer
[10515.40s -> 10517.40s]  Take half the money and stay quiet
[10523.25s -> 10525.57s]  It's 10 gold. What if I take half of it?
[10526.31s -> 10529.32s]  Take the money and run
[10529.32s -> 10531.32s]  Enough of this you snatch the money from the counter
[10533.48s -> 10538.44s]  Thief shouts the woman behind the bar the drunk man and quite a few others turn on you furiously
[10540.23s -> 10543.36s]  don't
[10545.17s -> 10547.17s]  You mess about with our beer
[10547.25s -> 10549.97s]  They cry and jump on you fist pounding fight back
[10551.12s -> 10555.92s]  You try to fight back, but the energy of the drunks is furious and they are fearless to boot
[10556.32s -> 10559.84s]  You eventually escape with several cuts bruises and scratches look back
[10561.28s -> 10566.56s]  Looking back you notice a pipe running from the tent directly into the jabaji river. It seems a beer isn't beer after all
[10568.15s -> 10570.87s]  Hey, we're good
[10570.87s -> 10573.19s]  murmur of excitement then quite suddenly a small what
[10574.08s -> 10580.64s]  From across the field comes a murmur of excitement then quite suddenly a small tornado lifts a tent sharply into the air in a way
[10581.44s -> 10583.96s]  I got 10 gold for that
[10583.96s -> 10587.24s]  You can enjoy your your your shit wine. That's fine your poop wine
[10588.04s -> 10602.39s]  I got 10 gold
[10602.39s -> 10606.07s]  You cross the fair to join a crowd gathered at a safe distance around a dancing bear
[10606.63s -> 10612.15s]  A dwarf stands in front of the bear holding a lead that is fastened to a ring in the creature's nose
[10613.54s -> 10619.14s]  See my beauty dance he growls jerking the cord the bear stumbles around in obvious pain
[10626.45s -> 10630.85s]  As he tugs the cable he plays a pipe with great gusto
[10631.49s -> 10635.01s]  The crowd are in stitches of laughter at the poor bear's performance
[10641.80s -> 10644.45s]  Really bear I might die doing this
[10647.56s -> 10651.92s]  Hold on you hang around for a moment and watch no fuck you
[10652.96s -> 10658.48s]  Most curious see if the bear will strike down its miserable little owner suddenly a cry goes up from somewhere in the audience
[10659.04s -> 10662.96s]  My gold my gold my pick pocket beware. That's a pick pocket at work pick pocket
[10663.60s -> 10668.16s]  You and the rest of the crowd spin around towards the voice and see a small creature darting off away from the crowd and into one
[10668.16s -> 10673.92s]  of the tents
[10673.92s -> 10676.88s]  No, fuck you
[10676.88s -> 10683.36s]  With everyone looking in one direction you turn to look in the other and see the dwarf release the cord holding the bear in place
[10684.23s -> 10691.27s]  But the creature does not go wild or attempt to run. In fact, both the dwarf and the bear seem to shrink down to the ground
[10693.32s -> 10694.85s]  What's going on?
[10694.85s -> 10696.45s]  Is this part of the show?
[10696.45s -> 10703.49s]  Okay
[10703.49s -> 10705.65s]  Just illusions perhaps
[10705.65s -> 10709.89s]  The crowd are out for blood now. It seems several of them have been robbed
[10710.61s -> 10714.05s]  Turning on one another accusations of theft begin to fly this way and that
[10714.93s -> 10719.60s]  Things are turning ugly and you are caught in the middle of it. See what I can get
[10720.90s -> 10722.50s]  in the tumult
[10722.50s -> 10727.46s]  You wait for an opportunity in every fight. There will always be some gold pouches swinging low for the plucking
[10727.86s -> 10733.62s]  You are knocked about a fair bit as you wait, but finally you see a bulging wallet just inches from your grasp
[10735.25s -> 10737.24s]  Look at the owner
[10737.24s -> 10741.40s]  Glancing up at the owner of the wallet. You find yourself staring into the huge face of a mountain man
[10745.62s -> 10747.62s]  You're a thief are you?
[10753.24s -> 10755.24s]  No, i'm no thief you tell him
[10758.26s -> 10760.50s]  Look at the size of his gold pouch
[10761.06s -> 10763.06s]  Remarks another voice nearby in the crowd
[10764.00s -> 10769.60s]  It's a trigger that sends the mountain man who had just been robbed himself into a fearsome rage. Oh god
[10769.68s -> 10772.48s]  I have to win. I gotta win every single one of these. Let's go
[10773.44s -> 10774.64s]  seven
[10774.64s -> 10776.64s]  Oh fuck
[10785.97s -> 10791.49s]  An instant later the man is thundering down on you arm swinging and he charges with every ounce of his strength knocking you back
[10791.97s -> 10794.69s]  The mountain man swings a final punch that knocks you into the mud
[10795.33s -> 10798.69s]  Then for good measure he stamps on your head and walks away
[10799.09s -> 10802.71s]  He probably doesn't realize that he has broken your skull wide open. Whatever
[10803.43s -> 10806.71s]  defend
[10806.71s -> 10808.71s]  All right, he's gonna come in full blast
[10811.70s -> 10814.00s]  Let's go like eight
[10814.08s -> 10816.08s]  How are you? No, no
[10827.56s -> 10829.40s]  Okay, wait, wait, wait
[10829.40s -> 10833.96s]  You put up your own and circle the mountain man steps back. He's gonna block again. All right
[10834.68s -> 10840.80s]  You stay low the crowd around jostle and struggle fighting amongst themselves. He circles
[10841.44s -> 10843.44s]  Through the fighting crowd. He's coming in
[10843.60s -> 10846.02s]  He's coming in full blast
[10846.02s -> 10848.66s]  Oh my fucking god, dude. What are you talking about?
[10849.54s -> 10856.37s]  i'm dead
[10856.37s -> 10864.21s]  That was three defends in a row. He steps back
[10867.48s -> 10869.14s]  Okay
[10869.14s -> 10874.66s]  He paces left
[10874.66s -> 10880.39s]  He circles right
[10880.39s -> 10883.03s]  He edges back you piece of shit
[10884.18s -> 10890.24s]  Fine take that
[10890.24s -> 10892.08s]  Okay, he sneers at me
[10892.08s -> 10894.90s]  Does that mean he's coming in or?
[10897.22s -> 10900.50s]  Does that he's nears at me? Does that mean he's gonna swing?
[10905.59s -> 10906.55s]  Got him
[10906.55s -> 10910.18s]  That was too much though. That was way too much. I'm dead
[10912.04s -> 10914.04s]  Yeah, i'm dead. I literally no
[10914.04s -> 10915.32s]  I'm not dead
[10915.32s -> 10921.56s]  pray to the ape
[10921.56s -> 10926.28s]  We're good five health
[10926.28s -> 10927.72s]  Nice, hell, yeah
[10927.72s -> 10929.24s]  Thank god for the ape
[10929.24s -> 10933.40s]  I wouldn't be able to beat that
[10933.40s -> 10937.66s]  Now he dodges back now we go little tiny little bit 2.0
[10939.86s -> 10944.23s]  And that should do it now. We go full blast. He goads you. All right, can I do it?
[10944.87s -> 10949.27s]  Yeah
[10949.27s -> 10952.71s]  You launch at him again. You grab a nearby bottle and break it against his head
[10953.27s -> 10955.43s]  The final punch makes the mountain man's head spin
[10957.49s -> 10959.09s]  Oh, never mind
[10959.09s -> 10961.09s]  He curses throwing up his hands
[10961.17s -> 10963.01s]  Keep your gold thief
[10963.01s -> 10966.31s]  But that he stomps away punching a few other people as he goes
[10967.84s -> 10970.72s]  You slither your way back out of the crowd to the main part of the fair
[10971.54s -> 10974.98s]  From somewhere nearby you catch a glimpse of a shadowy figure disappearing behind a tent
[10975.54s -> 10977.78s]  Something about the way it moves is familiar
[10977.94s -> 10983.88s]  I didn't get his gold
[10983.88s -> 10985.40s]  Follow the figure
[10985.40s -> 10995.11s]  Follow the figure you push through the crowd following the dark figure into a narrow gap
[10995.75s -> 10997.75s]  cautiously you enter the narrow space
[10998.07s -> 11000.07s]  And suddenly there is a hand at your throat
[11001.17s -> 11002.69s]  I will kill you
[11002.69s -> 11004.87s]  Reads a voice you recognize
[11009.12s -> 11010.96s]  You laugh with delight
[11010.96s -> 11012.40s]  It's flanker
[11012.40s -> 11015.70s]  The assassin whose life you spared before you reached torapani
[11016.80s -> 11018.82s]  Greetings you declare enthusiastically
[11019.68s -> 11023.44s]  Flanker nods he does not smile, but he seems pleased to see you
[11024.24s -> 11026.24s]  Aha my friend and enemy
[11026.72s -> 11028.48s]  I see like myself
[11028.48s -> 11030.88s]  You also enjoy the fun of the festival of thieves
[11031.52s -> 11033.36s]  But you look in poor shape
[11033.36s -> 11036.48s]  Have others been treating you more roughly than I was able to myself?
[11037.20s -> 11041.86s]  And how have you fared in Kari city is full of devils
[11042.42s -> 11046.26s]  flanker laughs
[11046.98s -> 11048.66s]  It is indeed
[11048.66s -> 11051.14s]  But at least you have not had to face the portal traps
[11051.78s -> 11055.46s]  They'll take your smile and move it to your throat as we assassins say
[11056.18s -> 11065.60s]  portal traps
[11065.60s -> 11067.04s]  I want your help
[11067.04s -> 11072.44s]  flanker nods
[11072.44s -> 11074.92s]  Ask of it and I shall do what I can
[11076.56s -> 11078.56s]  Oh, we send him on like an errand
[11078.80s -> 11082.80s]  I've been told to find a priest. I need to find a beggar who is a noble
[11082.88s -> 11085.68s]  Tell me about those portal. I need to know the order of the spell lines
[11089.43s -> 11090.23s]  um
[11090.23s -> 11092.23s]  Probably this one right because that's
[11092.71s -> 11099.99s]  check
[11099.99s -> 11100.95s]  uh
[11100.95s -> 11102.95s]  Lord theta is in the ruins
[11105.06s -> 11107.06s]  So this is the beggar
[11107.30s -> 11110.82s]  So I probably want to know this right?
[11116.52s -> 11124.96s]  Or the order I need to find a beggar who was a noble. I need to find the order of the spell lines
[11132.82s -> 11133.54s]  order
[11133.54s -> 11136.48s]  Okay, I need to do the order
[11136.48s -> 11137.84s]  flanker nods
[11137.84s -> 11142.39s]  I am told that Sansus did not entrust any of his nobles with the knowledge of their correct order
[11143.03s -> 11145.03s]  It was his final failsafe
[11145.03s -> 11147.33s]  But that does not mean it is not known
[11147.57s -> 11149.73s]  You might appeal to one of the gods to learn
[11150.45s -> 11154.24s]  Which god?
[11154.24s -> 11156.88s]  Slang is not strong enough for such knowledge. I think
[11157.44s -> 11159.44s]  Though you could try his shrine
[11159.68s -> 11161.67s]  between the well and the docks
[11161.67s -> 11162.79s]  otherwise
[11162.79s -> 11165.92s]  Corga would know but his temple is by the north gate
[11166.48s -> 11171.01s]  He nods finally, but I must be away. Perhaps I will see you again
[11171.89s -> 11177.01s]  I'll be drinking at the wayfarer's rest tonight in the docks join me if you will i'm getting fucking weirder
[11177.57s -> 11179.97s]  You nod to flanker in return. All right, the wayfarer's rest
[11182.84s -> 11185.19s]  um
[11185.19s -> 11187.75s]  Slang, okay, we need to we're gonna go find slang
[11188.31s -> 11192.82s]  Flang is up here, right?
[11192.82s -> 11196.20s]  Yeah
[11196.20s -> 11198.20s]  At the where is it tonight?
[11198.52s -> 11201.78s]  The wayfarer's rest. Where was that?
[11203.80s -> 11207.32s]  Go do corga. I can't do corga. I killed someone corga won't talk to me
[11207.80s -> 11215.83s]  You walk to the north end of the fairground midway
[11216.39s -> 11218.87s]  The fair continues from here and a road leads uphill
[11219.43s -> 11222.76s]  Fair knuckle fighting musicians
[11224.80s -> 11226.80s]  Um, let's do the musician
[11226.80s -> 11236.79s]  You head over to where a crowd are watching a troop of dancers who spin and swirl in time to a lively tune
[11237.35s -> 11239.35s]  There's something quite hypnotic about the performance
[11248.61s -> 11250.61s]  Wait, I can do it too
[11251.65s -> 11253.65s]  Let's do it i'll play with them
[11255.92s -> 11259.70s]  Cause a stench somebody farted at the concert
[11261.11s -> 11265.11s]  uh the sus
[11265.11s -> 11267.11s]  There's goes slow
[11267.91s -> 11270.95s]  I mean i'm gonna play with them. Yeah, that sounds like the fun thing to do. Let's do it
[11271.59s -> 11276.77s]  You cast the spell and begin to play your pipe
[11277.09s -> 11281.51s]  With the other dancers already setting a wonderful mood the spell's effects are magnified
[11282.05s -> 11285.41s]  And soon the entire crowd is dancing and jigging with each other
[11285.89s -> 11292.77s]  It is quite a sight a hundred of kare strange and wonderful creatures all waving their arms and stamping their feet
[11293.49s -> 11295.49s]  after about half an hour
[11295.57s -> 11300.37s]  The crowd grows tired and wanders off arm in arm and claw in claw
[11300.93s -> 11302.93s]  To see the other attractions of the fair
[11303.65s -> 11305.65s]  One of the musicians approaches you
[11306.24s -> 11307.60s]  nice work
[11307.60s -> 11310.72s]  Not often we get a talented amateur for the thieves dance
[11311.44s -> 11313.44s]  The crowd will think you were a stooge
[11316.55s -> 11323.65s]  Oh the thieves dance
[11323.65s -> 11325.17s]  The musician shrugs
[11325.17s -> 11326.37s]  It's just a name
[11326.37s -> 11328.53s]  He looks you over with a cany eye
[11329.35s -> 11332.31s]  Pack sword battle scars. You're not from kare. Are you?
[11333.25s -> 11335.25s]  Not just here to enjoy the fair
[11336.80s -> 11339.62s]  I'm visiting my father
[11342.18s -> 11343.94s]  Just visiting my dad
[11343.94s -> 11350.93s]  Maybe you can help me
[11350.93s -> 11356.72s]  Maybe you can help
[11356.72s -> 11361.00s]  Yeah, maybe I can
[11361.00s -> 11365.96s]  The musician drops down to the dirt and puts his hand out. My name is jira and it's good to meet you
[11367.88s -> 11369.60s]  You shake his hand
[11369.60s -> 11374.32s]  So you helped us get enough coins to pay for our night. How can I help you?
[11377.76s -> 11380.08s]  I need to open the north gate or I need somewhere to stay
[11382.04s -> 11384.16s]  I'm probably gonna say that
[11384.16s -> 11387.28s]  Because we we know what we need to go for the spell lines
[11388.23s -> 11390.23s]  But I've really my health is terrible
[11392.77s -> 11396.47s]  I need somewhere to stay
[11396.47s -> 11402.23s]  Well, you have to be careful in ins of kare some of them work in commission for the slavers if you know what I mean
[11402.79s -> 11406.07s]  He smiles sadly and for some reason taps his forearm as he speaks
[11407.52s -> 11411.04s]  We're staying at the meat and cleaver by the docks and I wouldn't recommend anywhere else
[11411.60s -> 11413.92s]  If you value your freedom, I'll see you there
[11414.64s -> 11416.64s]  He winks and heads off into the crowd
[11423.04s -> 11430.10s]  interesting
[11430.10s -> 11439.88s]  Bare-knuckle fighting you cross the fairground to a wrestling ring of ruffian inside is announcing the current challenge
[11440.92s -> 11442.53s]  People of kai
[11442.53s -> 11444.45s]  Are you ready for a fight?
[11444.45s -> 11446.45s]  In the white corner, we have our challenger
[11446.77s -> 11448.77s]  anva the barbarian
[11449.24s -> 11452.16s]  Crowd cheers and whoops
[11452.16s -> 11458.64s]  Look over anvar anvar is about half as tall as you again with sheets of muscle on his arms and legs
[11459.20s -> 11461.20s]  But he's probably lighter than the ogre
[11461.20s -> 11463.20s]  Which will mean he has less momentum
[11464.32s -> 11469.22s]  And in the black corner the brawling champion of kare the one they call skull splitter
[11469.76s -> 11472.00s]  the ogre kaga of tadu lei
[11472.88s -> 11478.85s]  The ogre looks as thick as any ogre you might meet but he is made of solid muscle
[11479.33s -> 11481.89s]  His arms and legs like the twisted bark of trees
[11483.22s -> 11487.86s]  Challenger, are you ready demands the ruffian anvar nods and beats his chest
[11488.58s -> 11499.19s]  Place a bet you find a wager man by looking for his enormous hat to which odds and returns are pinned on bits of cloth
[11499.91s -> 11502.40s]  Feeling lucky, are you?
[11503.44s -> 11505.44s]  Place your money on me
[11505.52s -> 11509.28s]  His palms are sweating and you notice he carries flick blades inside his sleeves
[11510.00s -> 11511.92s]  Give me all your money
[11511.92s -> 11520.66s]  What are the odds three to one on the challenger one to three on the champion?
[11522.71s -> 11524.23s]  What does that mean?
[11524.23s -> 11530.15s]  For every coin you bet on the barbarian you get three extra back if he wins
[11530.71s -> 11535.59s]  But for every three coins you put on the ogre you will only get one extra back if he wins
[11543.06s -> 11549.54s]  All right place a bet you take your money bet on the barbarian. I bet on the barbarian
[11550.85s -> 11553.65s]  Maximum bet is three pieces good odds though
[11554.37s -> 11561.62s]  You hand over three gold pieces and the bookkeeper makes a mark on his hat with a bet
[11562.71s -> 11567.35s]  Meanwhile in the ring the fight has begun the barbarian in the white corner growls and beats his chest
[11567.75s -> 11574.23s]  The ogre raises his fist into the air and shakes them quite a lot of posturing so far, but not much actual wrestling
[11584.71s -> 11588.71s]  Read minds
[11588.71s -> 11590.71s]  Stop lock doors
[11590.87s -> 11596.60s]  cause slowness
[11596.60s -> 11598.12s]  sap
[11598.12s -> 11600.84s]  Cause oh, yeah, I can cheat. I can cheat. I can cheat
[11603.38s -> 11605.70s]  I can sap the ogre and win. Yep
[11606.34s -> 11609.56s]  What is k?
[11609.56s -> 11611.56s]  create illusions
[11611.56s -> 11615.00s]  This might be fun. Wait, that would be cheating though. It'd be like why the fuck this guy come from
[11615.80s -> 11625.14s]  Let's do slowness
[11625.14s -> 11636.23s]  You ready the enchantment preparing to slow down one of the two combatants cast it on the ogre
[11636.79s -> 11643.48s]  You cast a spell over the ogre and the balance of the fight begins to change
[11644.12s -> 11648.68s]  Suddenly the ogre looks dizzy and slow and cannot seem to grip his opponent properly
[11649.32s -> 11653.48s]  The barbarian beats his chest and pounds the ogre heavily about the head
[11654.64s -> 11656.64s]  Anvar is looking good
[11658.18s -> 11660.12s]  Shout for the barbarian
[11660.12s -> 11661.48s]  Finish him
[11662.44s -> 11665.00s]  To the barbarian who bellows with anger
[11666.05s -> 11670.77s]  The slow-moving ogre roars with rage and struggles forward against the barbarian landing a mighty blow
[11671.57s -> 11673.73s]  Anvar's agility is helping him take the fight
[11674.37s -> 11676.93s]  Then the ogre puts in a devastating side swipe
[11677.41s -> 11682.05s]  The barbarian staggers suddenly the crowd gasps, but he picks himself up once more
[11688.79s -> 11696.44s]  Come on just
[11696.44s -> 11699.99s]  Cast depression on the ogre
[11699.99s -> 11703.13s]  You cast the enchantment over the ogre who begins to look thoroughly miserable
[11704.01s -> 11706.41s]  You have given anvar a much-needed boost
[11707.38s -> 11709.46s]  The ogre's lip has split and is bleeding
[11710.28s -> 11713.24s]  Anvar roars and thumps his opponent in the back
[11713.80s -> 11715.32s]  Anvar is winning
[11715.32s -> 11723.06s]  Should I wait cheer for the ogre?
[11724.09s -> 11731.40s]  Cheer for the barbarian
[11731.40s -> 11749.77s]  Should I cheer for the ogre now?
[11749.77s -> 11756.89s]  Uh, let's read the ogre's mind you read the ogre's mind, but find no particular thoughts except one
[11757.69s -> 11759.13s]  a sound
[11759.13s -> 11760.97s]  Playing over and over
[11760.97s -> 11764.09s]  It is the sound of an arm bone snapping in two
[11767.06s -> 11771.30s]  Growling and muttering the ogre works into the barbarian cracking his skull
[11772.66s -> 11774.66s]  Anvar is looking stronger than ever what?
[11778.46s -> 11780.46s]  God damn it kill him already
[11802.73s -> 11816.64s]  Okay illusions you ready the spell but what illusion will you cast make the ogre see the barbarian as plague-ridden
[11817.91s -> 11820.39s]  Make the barbarian see the ogre grow taller
[11824.79s -> 11826.81s]  Make the ogre see the barbarian as plague-ridden
[11831.43s -> 11835.67s]  You cast your spell over the ogre making the barbarian appear plague-ridden and infectious
[11836.63s -> 11838.63s]  Begins to hang back not wanting to engage
[11839.19s -> 11842.87s]  And every time anvar grabs him he begins to whimper with fear
[11843.59s -> 11846.39s]  The fight is going really badly for skull splitter now
[11847.11s -> 11854.15s]  Finally it is all over with a single throw anvar the barbarian powers forward and hurls skull splitter to the mat the crowd goes wild
[11855.16s -> 11857.16s]  You find the bookkeeper to collect your winnings
[11857.90s -> 11859.26s]  You got lucky
[11859.26s -> 11863.02s]  Sulk the bookkeeper he hands over 12 gold pieces. Oh, yeah
[11863.99s -> 11867.59s]  Inside the ring the master of the fight raises the barbarian's fist in the air
[11868.39s -> 11872.23s]  Who challenges our champion the prize is 10 gold pieces
[11873.74s -> 11875.10s]  I'll do it
[11875.10s -> 11876.78s]  I challenge him
[11876.78s -> 11878.31s]  You cry
[11878.31s -> 11880.95s]  All eyes turn to look at you the fight master beams
[11881.93s -> 11884.09s]  We have a stranger taking the challenger
[11885.03s -> 11886.23s]  Let him through
[11886.23s -> 11896.01s]  You got any food?
[11896.01s -> 11902.79s]  Yeah, all right. I can drink this. I don't care about healing somebody else. It's for me
[11907.74s -> 11913.90s]  Okay, the crowd parts and you are helped up into the ring under his breath the fight master outlines the rules
[11914.38s -> 11918.70s]  A fair fight no magic and pound your opponent until they can't stand
[11919.42s -> 11921.53s]  Ready?
[11921.53s -> 11926.57s]  You look over your opponent. He is almost half as tall as you again with muscles on his chest and arm
[11927.21s -> 11930.50s]  It's like sculpted to wax
[11930.50s -> 11935.22s]  In the back corner, then the ruffian announces is anvar in the white corner
[11935.94s -> 11937.94s]  ruffian turns to you and hisses
[11938.34s -> 11940.02s]  What should I call you?
[11940.02s -> 11954.30s]  The anilander the stranger. I don't care. Just get on with it the anilander. Oh boy. I get out. Okay
[11959.82s -> 11961.82s]  The anilander are you to cry?
[11962.14s -> 11966.70s]  Shouting it out to the crowd so they can hear they catch the name and throw it up to the sky
[11967.26s -> 11969.26s]  the anilander
[11970.22s -> 11976.95s]  They cheer the crowd begin to furiously place bets. You can hear them discussing your relative merits. He looks feeble. He looks like a maniac
[11977.43s -> 11979.32s]  You ready your fists
[11979.32s -> 11980.68s]  ball blast
[11980.68s -> 11984.12s]  Got him
[11984.12s -> 11986.33s]  Got him. Mm-hmm
[11986.33s -> 11989.05s]  He steps backwards across the ring putting space between you
[11989.93s -> 11993.30s]  That's gonna be a defense. He's gonna defend but we're gonna go like 2.5
[11994.10s -> 11998.94s]  Fuck you
[11998.94s -> 11999.98s]  All right
[11999.98s -> 12004.46s]  He grabs you and knees you in the midriff knocking the wind from your chest. Okay, I gotta defend here
[12006.89s -> 12008.89s]  Oh, come on. It's all right. I got enough power
[12009.45s -> 12015.08s]  I'm gonna go in full blast
[12015.58s -> 12019.32s]  Mmm
[12019.32s -> 12021.72s]  Reading a forceful blow the barbarian blocks
[12028.14s -> 12030.15s]  drop back defensively
[12030.15s -> 12035.59s]  Knocking you back. Okay, so he used his whole bar. We're gonna go like four. I could actually he might be able to do more
[12036.39s -> 12037.91s]  Yep, thank god
[12037.91s -> 12039.03s]  We're good
[12039.03s -> 12045.69s]  A gasp goes up from the crowd. We're going full blast again 6.4. Get him
[12046.57s -> 12048.87s]  It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. All right. All right, I'll win
[12049.51s -> 12054.09s]  The barbarian drops into a defensive crouch
[12062.71s -> 12067.51s]  The barbarian is holding back someone in the crowd is shouting advice body blow time
[12068.15s -> 12077.03s]  There it is. Got him. What?
[12077.19s -> 12085.34s]  How is that only one?
[12085.34s -> 12089.90s]  Shaking his stupid head. He picks himself through his feet once more. He moves away towards the other corner
[12090.54s -> 12093.03s]  Can I get him here? Can I catch him?
[12093.19s -> 12100.14s]  I caught him you lunge forward again writing a forceful swing you hurdle forward
[12100.62s -> 12104.14s]  Anvar staggers back gasping his face a mess of blood and bruises
[12105.32s -> 12107.32s]  Summoning the last ounce of strength in your arms
[12107.64s -> 12113.80s]  You ready a final knock back knockout punch that sends him back across the mat and out of the ring
[12114.44s -> 12117.13s]  Look at this fucking cash. I'm building up here
[12118.15s -> 12121.35s]  You stagger from the ring the crowd cheering for you and collect your winnings
[12122.38s -> 12129.21s]  I got 33 gold now
[12129.21s -> 12136.89s]  All right, the end of the fair
[12136.89s -> 12139.29s]  You push your way through the crowd following the road uphill
[12139.77s -> 12144.65s]  The party is getting wilder and you would do well to be away from here before things get out of hand
[12145.64s -> 12149.56s]  At the far edge of the fair the litter has left a tide mark on the grass
[12150.52s -> 12155.88s]  There's one last small tent here probably a ticket booth that has simply been ignored by the crowds of kare
[12159.35s -> 12161.83s]  Looking back you see what looks like one of the tents going up in flames
[12162.39s -> 12165.03s]  It must be part of the entertainment as no one seems too concerned
[12165.59s -> 12170.87s]  In fact a great cheer goes up as one of the strings of flags collapses into the bonfire
[12173.98s -> 12177.66s]  Ahead the road continues through empty fields and patches of rubble strewn wasteland
[12178.22s -> 12181.18s]  But it climbs so it must be heading for the center of kare
[12181.75s -> 12188.06s]  Steam rises from a large building beside a fork in the road you pause to walk around the small tent
[12188.38s -> 12194.10s]  To discover it is in fact a small attraction of its own a sign above the door reads cabinet of fortune
[12194.58s -> 12196.66s]  Try your luck a prize for all
[12197.72s -> 12199.74s]  You have time to test your luck
[12199.74s -> 12206.70s]  No doubt if you wanted
[12206.70s -> 12210.94s]  Uh, we're gonna go in here
[12210.94s -> 12213.50s]  You go over to the tent and push back the flap inside
[12213.90s -> 12219.58s]  A grubby bearded man leaps up from where he was sitting cross-legged on the floor and comes over to pump your hand
[12222.57s -> 12224.63s]  Welcome welcome my friend
[12224.63s -> 12226.63s]  And let's see what prize you can win today
[12227.03s -> 12231.35s]  You must know this there are no losers at honest hannah's cabinet of fortune
[12232.34s -> 12242.06s]  He gestures with one hand towards a large glass cabinet in the center of the tent interesting
[12244.62s -> 12247.50s]  Uh, what do I do? How much does it cost look inside the cabinet?
[12247.90s -> 12250.78s]  You step forward and peer in through the glass
[12251.42s -> 12257.34s]  Inside there are piles of jewelry books gold and other things as well as a small wiry creature
[12257.98s -> 12262.73s]  Curled up fast asleep. What is that creature?
[12263.86s -> 12265.22s]  My little pet
[12265.22s -> 12270.18s]  He's perfectly harmless. Oh, well, he bites but only when you open the cabinet to feed him
[12272.02s -> 12274.02s]  Uh, what do I do?
[12274.47s -> 12276.39s]  It's a most simple game
[12276.39s -> 12283.86s]  You give me two gold pieces and then my little pet will fetch something for you. Fuck up
[12284.76s -> 12286.76s]  The fuck up the fuck up
[12293.06s -> 12297.03s]  resurrect the dead
[12297.03s -> 12299.03s]  rap talk all languages
[12303.29s -> 12310.79s]  Talk all languages
[12310.79s -> 12311.99s]  tell
[12311.99s -> 12317.64s]  Read minds
[12317.64s -> 12321.16s]  Uh sus, obviously
[12321.24s -> 12326.28s]  uh magic protection
[12326.28s -> 12327.72s]  I'm gonna i'm gonna talk
[12327.72s -> 12340.63s]  I'm gonna do a rap you put on the wig and cast your spell not on hannah. Of course, you can understand everything he says
[12341.27s -> 12343.27s]  What about the creature in the glass cabinet?
[12343.43s -> 12346.31s]  Sadly though it is not speaking it sits in glum
[12347.19s -> 12349.40s]  thoughtful silence
[12349.40s -> 12363.51s]  shit
[12363.51s -> 12365.82s]  Here you pay two gold pieces
[12366.46s -> 12372.65s]  And hannah goes over to the cabinet and presses a small button on the side. It seems to operate a hold on
[12373.29s -> 12380.63s]  It's sneezed. I have to sneeze again
[12380.63s -> 12382.86s]  seems to operate a
[12382.86s -> 12384.62s]  canted levered spike
[12384.62s -> 12389.58s]  Which pokes the creature who squeals jumps from its perch and begins fluttering around inside the cave
[12391.91s -> 12394.31s]  What now?
[12394.31s -> 12399.51s]  You can try to influence its choice by shouting at it the angrier you can make it the better for the prize
[12400.07s -> 12402.34s]  Usually i'm not sure why
[12402.34s -> 12408.66s]  As if to make the point the creature picks up a ruby ring and smiles and drops it and flies up to the top
[12408.66s -> 12415.64s]  of the tank
[12415.64s -> 12417.50s]  Shout something
[12417.50s -> 12419.50s]  Although it does not seem very fair
[12419.50s -> 12424.30s]  You determine to infuriate you you determine to infuriate the creature as much as possible
[12425.48s -> 12427.48s]  Stupid creature freedom lorag
[12428.30s -> 12446.17s]  Kari lorag freedom freedom the creature in the tank flaps around gently. What else could you try?
[12446.57s -> 12449.90s]  I mean hannah obviously like right
[12453.19s -> 12454.07s]  hannah
[12454.07s -> 12456.38s]  The strange might is still flying around with glowing eyes
[12456.62s -> 12459.75s]  There must be something that will get this creature to see truly you see red
[12463.43s -> 12467.23s]  Lorag the flying thing circles around furiously
[12467.71s -> 12472.84s]  Eventually the creature selects something from the prize pool which it drops into a chute at the far end of the cabinet
[12479.04s -> 12482.11s]  I take what if I just leave it will that do something?
[12482.75s -> 12487.05s]  What is it?
[12487.05s -> 12489.34s]  a giant's tooth
[12489.34s -> 12491.18s]  a good prize
[12491.18s -> 12494.14s]  You nod to hannah who grimaces as you head back out of the tent
[12494.62s -> 12508.12s]  All right, we got us we got another tooth. I wonder how that could probably go a few different ways cool
[12508.68s -> 12514.49s]  Okay. All right, so we can all we can either go
[12515.13s -> 12518.52s]  Yeah, we can go out now
[12518.52s -> 12521.02s]  So we're trying to get
[12521.10s -> 12522.06s]  here
[12522.06s -> 12527.31s]  This area here get that in mind
[12531.05s -> 12537.84s]  You're back by the bath house on the edge of the fair. All right, so we can go in the bath house
[12538.40s -> 12542.46s]  Well, we can go uphill. We need to eventually go uphill. So we're going to bath house
[12542.78s -> 12551.37s]  Let's do the bath house. You step in the cool of the bath house
[12552.08s -> 12555.92s]  It is a wide building of marbled tiles and a sweet smell of pine and fresh wood
[12556.68s -> 12564.25s]  Gentle noises echo and murmur around the walls a creature by the front desk greets you with a smile. Good afternoon
[12566.46s -> 12569.56s]  The water is cool and fresh today
[12571.18s -> 12589.63s]  My swim costs four gold pieces. I need it. Is it worth it? Oh very the creature replies
[12592.44s -> 12596.12s]  The waters of cara are known for their healing and refreshing qualities
[12596.44s -> 12603.74s]  We have a steam room in a lagoon pool. You'll be well catered for sure
[12604.14s -> 12609.61s]  You enter before gold pieces and the concierge gestures you through into the center of the bath house
[12609.85s -> 12616.06s]  Where a wide pool awaits with trees and shrubs on either side the pool
[12618.56s -> 12622.08s]  From across the room steam curls from the doorway of a glass doored room
[12622.83s -> 12626.91s]  You strip off and pile your clothes and belongings in the corner of the room
[12628.86s -> 12630.92s]  I'm going to the steam room
[12630.92s -> 12636.92s]  You enter the steam room and take a seat on one of the benches. The temperature is almost unbearable through the curling smoke
[12636.92s -> 12640.38s]  You see another figure in the shadows. You are not alone
[12644.24s -> 12647.98s]  Hey, what's up? Hey, how you doing? What's up, dude?
[12656.72s -> 12666.80s]  I would that would never happen. I would never do this. Hey, what's up? Hey, you need a spotter
[12668.16s -> 12672.25s]  It's a steam room, dude
[12672.25s -> 12673.45s]  Greetings
[12673.45s -> 12675.24s]  You call through the smoke
[12675.24s -> 12679.08s]  The other figure does not reply but stands and moves away through the steam
[12679.71s -> 12683.17s]  You feel the blast of cold air as the door opens and then closes
[12688.88s -> 12691.68s]  I'm sorry if i'm in the steam room and I hear somebody from across
[12691.68s -> 12696.65s]  I'm sitting on the other side of the bench say greetings and be like, yeah, i'm getting the fuck out of here
[12697.77s -> 12703.79s]  I'm gonna go somewhere else you sit in the smoke enjoying the relaxing steam until you cannot take the heat anymore
[12704.80s -> 12706.84s]  Wait a little longer
[12706.84s -> 12712.28s]  You wait a little longer as the steam sinks deep into your bones and makes your muscles relax
[12712.92s -> 12719.79s]  You feel quite wonderful for it a second figure who you would not notice before stands and leaves the steam room
[12721.44s -> 12725.52s]  You head back out of the steam room. You feel your shoulders unknotting and your body relaxing
[12726.97s -> 12731.69s]  You dive into the pool and swim a few enjoyable lengths. You feel better for the exercise
[12732.01s -> 12740.28s]  You feel a great calm and relaxedness flooding through your veins feeling much better. You turn and collect your belongings
[12741.20s -> 12747.40s]  Yeah, check them over not trusting the city to pass up the chance to rob you you check through your belongings
[12748.09s -> 12750.09s]  But everything seems to still be in in place
[12750.57s -> 12756.12s]  Pleased you head for the exit the creature at the front desk beams cheerfully at you you step outside onto the street
[12756.20s -> 12758.64s]  We just that's there it is good rest
[12762.81s -> 12763.05s]  All right
[12763.05s -> 12773.66s]  We're gonna go up uphill the road twists and turns up the rise until you emerge into a wider road on the edge
[12773.74s -> 12777.45s]  Of the dense slum from inside down a street to the left
[12777.77s -> 12782.80s]  You can hear the very faint sound of singing a smell of rotting fish begins to fill the air
[12783.29s -> 12787.56s]  You must be close to the docks
[12787.56s -> 12787.80s]  All right
[12787.80s -> 12793.84s]  So where is this place between the well and the docks is it this way or is it this way?
[12794.08s -> 12801.24s]  Is it the docks or is it near the well?
[12801.64s -> 12811.12s]  I'm gonna imagine we can we can go this way and hopefully we can go from here to there
[12811.36s -> 12819.56s]  Let's go to the well winding between tall
[12820.26s -> 12824.76s]  crazily built slum dwellings the road you are now on leads through the dense lower city
[12825.48s -> 12830.20s]  The street is narrow and you keep your head held high in case someone should try their luck with a blade
[12831.13s -> 12838.33s]  After a few minutes of edging floors you emerge into a wider space a flag-stoned plaza at the center of it is a circular well mouth
[12838.91s -> 12840.91s]  alleyways lead off in four directions
[12842.46s -> 12844.46s]  You pause to look around the edge of the square
[12844.78s -> 12850.62s]  The alleyways all look the same except that to the left the lane heads downwards turning away from the center of kare
[12852.25s -> 12857.61s]  The only thing the alleys have in common is that they converge here once presumably this well served all the people in the district
[12858.09s -> 12862.01s]  But perhaps there were too many people because now the well seems dusty and dry
[12863.84s -> 12867.37s]  Look down the well
[12867.37s -> 12870.09s]  Leaning over the edge you peer down into the depths of the well strange
[12870.09s -> 12874.49s]  This well seems to have handholds cut into its stones. They appear good enough to climb down
[12875.05s -> 12883.87s]  Uh, we're not going down here. We're gonna choose the road. Here we go. All right, so we need to this is where we need to go
[12884.43s -> 12890.40s]  This is where we need to be
[12890.40s -> 12892.40s]  This direction between the well and the docks
[12894.12s -> 12901.00s]  This street is a little wider and more well paved than some of the others. You can see tracks where carts have come this way
[12901.80s -> 12903.80s]  You hear the sound of voices around a corner
[12906.12s -> 12908.32s]  Walk on
[12908.32s -> 12910.32s]  You walk around the corner intrigued by the sound
[12911.31s -> 12915.07s]  There is a small crowd of people talking and singing inside a low stone shrine
[12915.87s -> 12920.83s]  Beyond you can see the sparkle of the river and the smell of rotting fish. You're nearly at the docks
[12921.31s -> 12926.19s]  There's the shrine. All right, let's go. Let's get that out of the line
[12926.83s -> 12932.73s]  You step into the doorway of the shrine at the same time as a woman and her child are leaving
[12934.03s -> 12937.15s]  He really is a holy man mother the little one is saying
[12937.80s -> 12949.04s]  Lassen's lame brother answered his question and he ran off the stage the mother nods and the pair leave interesting step inside
[12951.40s -> 12953.40s]  The shrine is an old stone building
[12954.02s -> 12957.00s]  garishly decorated with hanging cloths and thick candles
[12958.30s -> 12964.68s]  That fill the air with the smell of grease and tar at the far end on a low platform stands a hooded figure in a white robe
[12965.18s -> 12972.97s]  Who was talking to the assembled crowd? Oh, this is the cerise. This is okay. Yep. I remember this remember this
[12972.97s -> 12983.52s]  We saw maybe we've read our own fortune. This is we did this already remember it was a guy in the white robe
[12983.92s -> 12988.40s]  Does anyone else wish to test?
[12988.48s -> 12996.60s]  Let me do that again. Does anyone else wish to take the test of slang god of malice?
[12996.92s -> 13008.41s]  Reese calls out a murmur goes around the crowd people are nervous but excited examine the crowd crowd is a mixture of young and
[13008.41s -> 13012.44s]  old women and men some cheer and joke and murmur while other
[13013.71s -> 13018.19s]  Have their legs and arms folded in a devout pose and pray through silent lips
[13019.00s -> 13027.58s]  How many are spectators and how many are followers of slang you cannot tell anyone who can answer the question will be granted their wish
[13028.14s -> 13035.05s]  The priest continues wait and watch you wait and watch suddenly a man leaps to his feet
[13035.68s -> 13040.82s]  I'll do it. He declares the rest of the group cheers and the man a geriatric
[13041.52s -> 13046.32s]  Is helped up onto the platform. Are you a follower of slang?
[13048.00s -> 13056.17s]  The man spits very well in one corner of the room a gong is sounded and the crowd falls silent
[13059.55s -> 13063.60s]  Which do you choose the priest demands of the man?
[13064.73s -> 13070.84s]  Will you take the impossible challenge or pay the price of the easy challenge?
[13071.16s -> 13077.23s]  The man looks uncertain and turns to the audience people begin to shout suggestions
[13079.21s -> 13088.60s]  Choose the impossible choose the easy one choose the impossible you cry out adding your voice to those around you
[13089.10s -> 13096.11s]  Bellowing loud and confidently after a few minutes the priest quiets the room and turns back to the man
[13097.00s -> 13106.43s]  So what do you choose i'll take the impossible challenge the man grins very well very well
[13107.15s -> 13110.97s]  There is no price for the impossible challenge. Are you ready?
[13113.61s -> 13122.43s]  Wait and listen then tell me what is the answer to the question that is never asked
[13122.75s -> 13128.20s]  The man falls silent for a moment chewing his lower lip and musing over his answer
[13129.90s -> 13132.78s]  Um
[13132.94s -> 13142.20s]  Silence the priest smiles sadly and shakes his head a clever answer but not correct. Oh
[13143.56s -> 13147.53s]  The crowd sigh in disappointment a man at your elbow remarks
[13148.75s -> 13150.83s]  People always try the impossible challenge
[13150.83s -> 13155.82s]  You'd think they'd get the hint the man leaves the platform and the priest turns back to the crowd
[13156.96s -> 13165.52s]  Who will be next as he waits for an answer the priest plucks a knife from his belt and casually stabs it into his own hand
[13168.78s -> 13175.56s]  I'll take the challenge because we know the answer. I will take your challenge a stranger
[13176.52s -> 13188.30s]  Welcome him, please. Welcome. Welcome him. The crowd whisper and murmur as you make your way to the platform
[13189.39s -> 13195.92s]  Welcome stranger. Are you ready to take the challenge knowing folwell that very few succeed
[13198.16s -> 13199.28s]  I am
[13199.28s -> 13202.86s]  the crowd cheer
[13202.86s -> 13205.77s]  Your response
[13205.77s -> 13210.46s]  Then know this flying is not a punishing god, but he is malicious
[13211.34s -> 13213.34s]  He does not wish for you to fail
[13214.00s -> 13215.76s]  But should you fail?
[13215.76s -> 13219.36s]  He wishes you to know that it was all your own fault
[13221.76s -> 13222.72s]  Mm-hmm
[13222.72s -> 13224.56s]  The priest continues
[13224.56s -> 13231.44s]  Our practice is that you may choose which question to answer but know this one is impossible and the other is easy
[13232.00s -> 13235.76s]  And to answer the easy question you must give up something you hold most dear
[13236.80s -> 13240.48s]  The crowd are watching in it and expect in silence. It's time for you to choose
[13240.96s -> 13254.27s]  Make sure I get this right
[13254.27s -> 13259.02s]  What was it?
[13259.02s -> 13264.24s]  The answer to the question in the vision you saw the answer to the question that has never been asked sirisi
[13264.80s -> 13271.90s]  Okay, that's making sure I get it, right
[13272.67s -> 13274.67s]  I choose the impossible question
[13277.55s -> 13281.39s]  The crowd wait expectantly and the priest closes his eyes and intones
[13282.49s -> 13285.45s]  What is the answer to the question that has never been asked?
[13286.46s -> 13291.72s]  Your heart leaps your vision is coming to pass. I don't know
[13292.68s -> 13295.39s]  sirisi
[13295.39s -> 13296.83s]  There is a moment
[13296.83s -> 13297.95s]  pause
[13297.95s -> 13300.35s]  As the priest screws up his eyes
[13300.99s -> 13310.14s]  The priest nods once slowly that is correct. The question has never been answered
[13310.86s -> 13316.14s]  In the three thousand years since this site was first made wholly to slang
[13317.32s -> 13323.32s]  The answer has been passed on from one priest to the next I never thought I would be the one to hear it spoken
[13323.88s -> 13326.04s]  Because I do not understand it
[13326.04s -> 13333.18s]  And I do not know the question he turns to you and bows his head once you are truly blessed
[13333.98s -> 13336.48s]  Please what is your wish?
[13338.09s -> 13342.41s]  I wish to be rich beyond my imagination. Tell me the spell for the north gate
[13342.81s -> 13347.21s]  Tell me the order of the spell can kare be saved. I wish to be stronger than anyone ever
[13348.67s -> 13350.99s]  That's like a toddler the thing to say
[13351.71s -> 13356.35s]  I wish to be stronger than anyone ever even superman even god stronger than god answer man
[13361.00s -> 13362.62s]  um
[13362.62s -> 13369.34s]  It's the spell right because this is where one of the lines is from tell me the spell for the north gate
[13376.48s -> 13378.48s]  Tell me the spell for the north gate
[13378.48s -> 13381.61s]  The priest closes his eyes and summons his god
[13384.03s -> 13386.43s]  I cannot tell you the spell in its entirety
[13387.07s -> 13390.88s]  But mulaz the second noble was a follower of slang
[13391.44s -> 13394.72s]  And the line he knew was I bid you portals
[13395.44s -> 13396.64s]  wide
[13396.64s -> 13401.88s]  open

[13409.28s -> 13414.41s]  Clearly not many survived the challenge of slang back on the street at his night time to find somewhere to rest
[13418.94s -> 13420.94s]  I said I said I said it wrong
[13421.42s -> 13428.14s]  This priest has the only opportunity in his entire lifetime to hear this it's been thousands of years
[13428.62s -> 13432.14s]  And he screws up the sentence. He must be like fuck
[13432.70s -> 13435.66s]  Oh, how could I do that? I gotta be so stupid
[13436.46s -> 13442.84s]  You needed the order. Well, I didn't have I I didn't have the line
[13443.74s -> 13450.75s]  This is where I could get the line
[13450.75s -> 13460.03s]  Yeah, the order is I don't I need the the the lines first. Yeah, I can still get it
[13463.29s -> 13466.97s]  I think I don't I already have the order. Wasn't it scratched on something? Hold on
[13467.61s -> 13473.40s]  Remember wasn't I like I I swear see here it is right there
[13477.29s -> 13478.25s]  No

[13485.69s -> 13497.04s]  That's that's it. Isn't it?
[13497.04s -> 13499.92s]  Tumblers to yep, that's that's it. We got the we already have the order
[13501.92s -> 13503.92s]  One lock made of golems hide
[13505.92s -> 13507.92s]  Tumblers to seal deep inside
[13508.68s -> 13510.68s]  I bid you portals open wide
[13513.47s -> 13516.19s]  For my legs to walk in here and fucking stride
[13516.67s -> 13520.81s]  We just need the last line
[13520.81s -> 13522.81s]  Which is down here
[13523.05s -> 13536.83s]  Okay, let's uh head to the docks. What's the the clue for this one?
[13537.47s -> 13547.92s]  Okay, seventh noble theta is a beggar
[13549.52s -> 13551.12s]  blind beggar
[13551.12s -> 13557.69s]  Can be found blind and begging in the ruins of the fallen quarter of the city
[13562.03s -> 13563.61s]  so
[13563.61s -> 13565.29s]  He's down here
[13565.29s -> 13568.75s]  So we're gonna figure out a way to get down there
[13572.00s -> 13572.88s]  Okay
[13572.88s -> 13574.48s]  Uh, let's have it the docks

[13582.09s -> 13585.05s]  You've reached the docks once more the beating heart of care
[13585.53s -> 13588.86s]  There are two or three ships moored for the night
[13589.10s -> 13593.76s]  And the space between them and the road is filled with a large huge number of stalls and little shops
[13594.16s -> 13598.72s]  Selling everything from fishing tackle to sailing blocks to barrels of woodlouse rum
[13599.04s -> 13604.30s]  This must be a thriving marketplace during the day with night approaching. It is a maze of booths and cloth
[13604.86s -> 13609.58s]  A single bridge crosses the river here operated with ropes. He'll let the tall ships through
[13610.08s -> 13613.38s]  Right now the bridge is up to allow ships to sail through undisturbed
[13614.91s -> 13618.64s]  There are two inns visible from here the wayfarer's rest

[13824.84s -> 13829.98s]  Jesus
[13829.98s -> 13836.32s]  The innkeeper behind the bar is trying to serve numerous creatures all demanding ale at the same time while around the tables
[13836.80s -> 13841.36s]  Salty types and buxom wenches are laughing together and singing shanties

[13920.20s -> 13927.44s]  Okay, what about your ale the innkeeper holds up one finger
[13928.16s -> 13933.84s]  A ruffian knocks over a dwarf's mug of ale the fight that breaks out is short sharp and ends with the heel of an axe
[13933.92s -> 13939.20s]  Breaking the ruffian's nose a great cheer goes up and the innkeeper replaces the ale
[13939.84s -> 13943.16s]  free of charge

[13958.36s -> 13961.64s]  The innkeeper holds up four fingers rather than shouting across the bar
[13963.18s -> 13966.16s]  Uh, i'm gonna drink my ale
[13966.16s -> 13970.40s]  You knock tankers with the creatures on either side of you then drain the beer in one swoop
[13971.04s -> 13975.52s]  It is a nutty pleasant beer fills your stomach with a pleasing warm glow
[13976.84s -> 13978.84s]  Anytime I read about
[13979.90s -> 13981.50s]  You guys get like this too
[13981.50s -> 13982.94s]  when I read
[13982.94s -> 13984.94s]  about people drinking beer
[13985.50s -> 13989.26s]  In fantasy novels, I want a beer right now
[13989.92s -> 13991.93s]  right
[13991.93s -> 13998.19s]  I don't really like beer. I'm not a big beer guy, but I just think of this frothy freezing cold mug
[13999.07s -> 14003.47s]  That's got this stout in it. I just want one
[14003.95s -> 14011.69s]  They describe beer so insanely and so deliciously in all these fantasy novels. Oh a flagon of ale
[14017.37s -> 14021.60s]  I don't know
[14022.38s -> 14027.74s]  They describe it like a nice root beer. Yeah replace that with a with a soda right or a root beer
[14028.38s -> 14032.46s]  A nice frothy foamy root beer. Oh, it's so good
[14036.44s -> 14038.28s]  Okay
[14038.28s -> 14040.84s]  Uh, let's take let's take another one. Come on. I got money
[14044.56s -> 14045.92s]  Oh, I didn't read this
[14045.92s -> 14049.76s]  But you knock tankers the creature on either side of you then drain the beer in one swoop is a nutty and pleasant
[14049.76s -> 14051.76s]  It fills your stomach with a pleasing warm glow
[14052.76s -> 14054.12s]  finest and curry
[14054.12s -> 14056.84s]  The innkeeper remarks seeing your satisfied smile
[14057.56s -> 14062.84s]  Ain't nothing that beats a good glass of wayfarers ripe. You should have another two seconds always better
[14064.67s -> 14066.84s]  Yeah, i'm taking another one. Let's go
[14066.84s -> 14071.00s]  You knock back your second mug of fine ale and feel yourself ruddy with good health
[14071.64s -> 14076.04s]  This inn is a charming place really and the people here are very friendly
[14076.60s -> 14079.47s]  The innkeeper nods with approval
[14079.47s -> 14081.79s]  All the best can put it away he remarks
[14082.60s -> 14092.19s]  Another one you buy some more beer you sweep back a third mug of ale. The effect is immediate
[14092.67s -> 14095.55s]  First your eyes start to fizz then your head starts to ache
[14096.19s -> 14098.75s]  You half get to your feet, but you can barely work out which way is up
[14099.39s -> 14101.87s]  Three blurry men approach you and take you by the arm
[14103.56s -> 14106.04s]  You're all right. Let me help you with that
[14107.18s -> 14111.18s]  Something moves and you feel a hard blow on your head about three seconds later
[14111.18s -> 14113.74s]  You realize you've been knocked unconscious as everything goes black
[14125.37s -> 14126.25s]  What?
[14126.25s -> 14134.59s]  What about flick flanker your eyes open your head is thundering and it feels ready to split
[14138.54s -> 14147.72s]  Where's flanker?
[14147.72s -> 14150.60s]  We drank two beers. What was what's going on?
[14154.04s -> 14157.07s]  Do we get to rewind?
[14157.07s -> 14160.43s]  This is a chat decision not mine. It's got to be at least 75 percent by the way
[14162.89s -> 14164.89s]  One rewind yes or no
[14166.03s -> 14177.15s]  It's got to be 75 percent. Yes, or it's not happening. This is the only that's it
[14183.82s -> 14185.32s]  It's got to get to
[14185.32s -> 14191.26s]  75 percent
[14191.26s -> 14193.26s]  Are we rewinding? Yes or no?
[14193.42s -> 14210.03s]  It says a pole is already active, but I can't see it. You guys see a pole. It says one's already there
[14212.51s -> 14223.77s]  Where is it? Yeah, it says a pole is active. Oh
[14225.84s -> 14245.39s]  Uh, let me see if I can I think it's stuck. Yeah, it says a pole is already active. It's stuck
[14245.95s -> 14256.89s]  You had to refresh for the pole. I'll try refreshing it. I have to refresh chat. All right. Hold on. Let me refresh chat real quick
[14266.33s -> 14288.41s]  Uh-huh refresh did that work? I can't see it. Wait. Oh you guys are lying. Um, I can see it now
[14288.41s -> 14301.23s]  All right. So what was that? It was 80 percent 79 percent. All right
[14306.23s -> 14316.51s]  79 percent we're going to the bar. All right greetings this time. We're gonna well this time. We're gonna just we're gonna buy food
[14317.48s -> 14321.96s]  This place is great pay for a meal. I'm gonna do everything at the same, but i'm only gonna drink two beers
[14322.28s -> 14329.76s]  Oh, whoops. All right price of your ale. All right. Yes, it's the best. Yes. I'll buy some
[14330.92s -> 14334.86s]  All right delicious. It's good. It's so good
[14336.62s -> 14340.88s]  All right, buy another one. This one's delicious, too
[14342.72s -> 14345.08s]  All right. Goodbye
[14345.08s -> 14348.20s]  You push your way back out of the crowd at the bar your eyes roam around the busy room
[14348.60s -> 14351.96s]  And the light on a shadowy figure in the corner. It's flanker
[14353.29s -> 14355.29s]  Blankers table. Okay, let's go
[14358.72s -> 14365.56s]  You go over and sit by the assassin. There you are. He declares with pleasure. He seems more relaxed than earlier
[14366.04s -> 14368.44s]  Perhaps he has completed whatever mission he was here to perform
[14369.08s -> 14370.97s]  But tell me friend
[14370.97s -> 14374.31s]  Do you play dice?
[14374.31s -> 14376.28s]  swindle stones
[14376.28s -> 14380.17s]  Ah, I see, you know it from a hidden pouch in his tunic
[14380.25s -> 14383.53s]  He pulls a set of dice out and pushes half of them across the table to you
[14384.17s -> 14386.06s]  Sure
[14386.06s -> 14387.34s]  You take them
[14387.34s -> 14390.03s]  Uh, what's the steak?
[14391.44s -> 14393.76s]  Let me propose a modest wager
[14394.76s -> 14395.96s]  If you win
[14395.96s -> 14397.96s]  I will help you with your quest
[14398.52s -> 14400.12s]  But if I win
[14400.12s -> 14403.64s]  My obligation to you is at an end and should we meet again?
[14404.28s -> 14407.80s]  I will have the freedom to cleave your neck from your shoulders
[14408.44s -> 14412.35s]  Do you agree?
[14412.35s -> 14415.71s]  Uh, I prefer to keep you in my debt if I lose you'll kill me
[14416.80s -> 14421.80s]  Very well
[14421.80s -> 14422.76s]  well
[14422.76s -> 14430.56s]  I just have to win. Let's go
[14430.56s -> 14441.31s]  Like your hands are your dice and takes the first bid just don't lose. So what are you doing? Car it my friend
[14449.68s -> 14450.80s]  Three ones
[14450.80s -> 14454.81s]  Let's go fucking hard
[14454.81s -> 14460.19s]  Whoa
[14460.19s -> 14462.19s]  You don't have he has to have four of those
[14463.61s -> 14468.49s]  I will not allow your inane words to turn me from my game. So do not attempt such a strategy
[14469.21s -> 14474.91s]  There's no way
[14474.91s -> 14480.67s]  There are five threes. You gotta be shitting me dude. Really? That's so that's actually bullshit truly
[14488.32s -> 14495.61s]  Two ones
[14495.69s -> 14499.29s]  Three threes
[14499.29s -> 14501.29s]  Oh, no
[14504.57s -> 14506.17s]  What is this hand
[14506.17s -> 14509.05s]  This guy's got a full house. What is this twos and ones?
[14514.97s -> 14517.05s]  What is this? His both of his hands have been?
[14518.15s -> 14520.15s]  Outrageous they've been outrageous
[14529.45s -> 14538.80s]  I'm so screwed
[14539.28s -> 14548.75s]  Yeah, I mean I have one of them call it. Uh
[14550.73s -> 14556.73s]  So he has to have three of them. Does he is he gonna have three of these? No, there's no way you don't have three
[14557.68s -> 14571.45s]  It's your whole hand call. There we are. All right, that's better one three
[14581.36s -> 14582.73s]  Two fours
[14582.73s -> 14590.38s]  Don't call it you piece of shit. You definitely have it
[14595.32s -> 14599.48s]  Okay, so i'm gonna say four. I have two that means he okay. Yeah, we're doing four
[14600.49s -> 14613.63s]  Call it. Yes
[14613.63s -> 14629.29s]  All right. This is not a bad hand. I'm gonna say two ones two
[14630.01s -> 14631.31s]  fours
[14631.31s -> 14638.78s]  Oh, you're in trouble. You're actually in trouble three fours call it four fours
[14640.01s -> 14642.70s]  Mmm
[14642.70s -> 14646.70s]  But should I say five fours? No, that's that has to mean that
[14649.04s -> 14651.31s]  One of us has to have a full set
[14651.31s -> 14654.27s]  But what if he has two we have the same amount of uh dice
[14659.44s -> 14668.25s]  liar
[14668.25s -> 14670.72s]  one two
[14670.72s -> 14676.67s]  Uh, two twos three twos
[14680.30s -> 14688.52s]  You are stupid you are stupid what a comeback this is big
[14690.17s -> 14693.79s]  Uh, let's start with
[14693.79s -> 14712.64s]  One two one five, okay two ones call it. Okay, so he has a five fuck
[14713.92s -> 14717.20s]  He has a five so I have uh, I have a five too though
[14718.44s -> 14719.56s]  Three
[14719.56s -> 14726.25s]  No, I I keep saying five because I just see it as a regular dice. Don't call it
[14729.12s -> 14734.91s]  It's fine, whatever he's gonna win a round he picked the two worst possible things. It's all right
[14738.38s -> 14743.07s]  one three
[14743.07s -> 14749.63s]  Um one four two threes. Oh you lose
[14752.20s -> 14754.68s]  Ha you are in my debt now
[14755.24s -> 14758.27s]  Blanker
[14758.27s -> 14761.31s]  You flick flanker's final die off the table with a grin
[14761.95s -> 14762.99s]  I win
[14762.99s -> 14765.74s]  Blanker nods deeply
[14765.74s -> 14767.58s]  Sinler preserve me
[14767.58s -> 14769.71s]  I have lost to you again
[14769.71s -> 14775.45s]  Come with me. I will take you to the council. I want the spell lines
[14776.65s -> 14785.20s]  Council the leaders of kare are mad men and pirates, but not fools
[14786.00s -> 14788.56s]  They might be persuaded to see the sense of your mission
[14789.37s -> 14792.33s]  Especially if we have the gold to cover their pockets
[14793.15s -> 14796.70s]  Shall we go?
[14796.70s -> 14799.26s]  Where is the council?
[14799.26s -> 14800.78s]  It is hard to find
[14800.78s -> 14805.58s]  It is the tallest building in kare, but most of its height is built or underground
[14806.06s -> 14808.54s]  But from the street, it looks like just another dwelling place
[14809.02s -> 14812.97s]  But I know where it is
[14812.97s -> 14818.14s]  Um, I kind of want to do my own path
[14820.56s -> 14821.36s]  but
[14821.36s -> 14833.85s]  Should we just go with them? What about your food? All right, let's go
[14835.00s -> 14839.00s]  Excellent flanker beams finishes his beer and then gestures to the door follow me
[14844.12s -> 14849.37s]  Follow flanker
[14849.37s -> 14853.45s]  You follow flanker across the top of the dock. He moves fast like a fleeting shadow
[14853.85s -> 14856.41s]  But somehow contrives to never disappear from your sight
[14856.73s -> 14864.30s]  He does not speak and your attempts at conversation are met with immediate silence at the council
[14868.06s -> 14874.91s]  Finally you arrive outside an ordinary looking building. This is it wait here and I will go inside
[14876.06s -> 14884.12s]  He disappears through the door the house into which flanker has gone is just that surely
[14884.73s -> 14886.97s]  The windows are thick bottle glass
[14887.53s -> 14894.94s]  And the door is tarred wood studded with rivets and painted black the roof only a single story up is overgrown with weeds
[14895.50s -> 14901.63s]  Other identical dwellings stand either side still nothing the building in front of you does not seem like any council chamber
[14902.11s -> 14906.08s]  Perhaps this is a trap
[14906.08s -> 14911.44s]  Um look in the windows you peer in through one of the windows
[14911.84s -> 14917.60s]  But the glass is so thick and heavily streaked on the inside with candle grease that you cannot make out anything
[14921.10s -> 14928.92s]  I'm gonna wait you wait flanker does not reappear. I will wait minutes pass
[14931.63s -> 14933.82s]  Wait time passes in the distance
[14933.82s -> 14937.02s]  You hear the sound of cartwheels rattling down the cobbles from the dock
[14937.26s -> 14946.83s]  They're quickly lost in the bustle of loakare. Wait, you hear the footsteps of the guard marching past
[14947.15s -> 14951.20s]  Perhaps they will come here, but then they turn away this place
[14951.28s -> 14959.64s]  It seems is not even important enough to warrant a visit long minutes pass
[14962.52s -> 14970.40s]  Time passes more time passes minutes pass. All right
[14971.42s -> 14985.08s]  All right. It's time to go because what if something happened to him one more one more more time one more one more
[14985.32s -> 14992.12s]  Try the door ignoring flankers instructions. You try the door. It is unlocked
[14992.20s -> 15001.64s]  I'm sorry, but like that was that was like 40 fucking minutes. That was 40 minutes something could have gone wrong
[15005.40s -> 15009.08s]  You were in a wide room chairs line the walls, but there is no other furniture
[15009.64s -> 15012.60s]  If this is someone's house, then it has become meticulously robbed
[15013.31s -> 15016.54s]  But if not, you cannot see what function it does serve
[15016.70s -> 15021.60s]  But it cannot be abandoned a fire in the hearth blazes out heat. There's no sign of flanker anywhere
[15021.76s -> 15050.54s]  But there are also no other doors god. It's too sus cast the spell and wait as a calm voice enters your mind
[15051.02s -> 15057.04s]  It speaks in reassuring tones telling that you are quite safe and everything in this room can be trusted
[15057.68s -> 15060.40s]  Although that not not everything is quite as it appears
[15060.72s -> 15068.22s]  Look at the fire you go over to the fire to warm your hands
[15068.30s -> 15076.19s]  It seems normal enough and it's hot enough to roast a pig a voice booms out from nowhere. Please be seated
[15078.12s -> 15081.96s]  Uh, okay
[15081.96s -> 15084.28s]  You choose a seat close to the fire and sit down
[15085.16s -> 15087.96s]  Something strange happens the moment you take your weight off your feet
[15088.97s -> 15094.32s]  It is as though the far wall no longer exists in its place is a long hallway
[15094.72s -> 15101.02s]  Lying with cloth banners and torches on brass poles two guards stand half way down the hallway
[15101.66s -> 15108.64s]  And between them you see a flanker deep in conversation. Yeah. Well, what the fuck? Why am I sitting out there?
[15108.72s -> 15113.61s]  Let me in you hang back and watch the scene. I'm sorry
[15114.01s -> 15118.89s]  The council is in session. You cannot be disturbing them. Blanker is shaking his head
[15119.21s -> 15127.68s]  That is incorrect as you well know the guard smiles tightly in reply blanker turns around and waves to you
[15128.43s -> 15136.81s]  Please join me. Yeah, what the fuck man you stand astride. You leave me outside for like an hour
[15139.24s -> 15144.20s]  I'm sorry, but there's always okay if i'm gonna if we're adventuring together you and I you and me us
[15145.23s -> 15148.27s]  And I say don't come in yet. Let me go in there you wait outside
[15148.75s -> 15151.45s]  But if more than 30 minutes pass
[15152.30s -> 15155.74s]  Come in with your swords run and be ready to fucking kill. You know what I mean?
[15156.22s -> 15165.53s]  Like you give a time limit if 35 minutes pass come get me because something horrible happened to be ready with a fucking magical fireball
[15165.61s -> 15181.72s]  Okay, always give a hard time limit the council. I'm afraid the council is in session. The guard repeats louder now
[15183.05s -> 15189.47s]  Wait, I need to see what are you talking about? We need to see them and I need to see them
[15190.36s -> 15195.76s]  No one sees the council when they are in session. Um, what does flanker do?
[15196.51s -> 15204.20s]  You hang back to see what flanker will do the assassin bows his cowled head. I am sorry for your family
[15204.84s -> 15210.52s]  He says quietly then a moment later his long steel blade is in his hands and at the neck of one of the guards
[15213.60s -> 15220.57s]  I didn't do it. I didn't do anything. Um, should I just let him do it? Should I go for the other guard?
[15220.89s -> 15225.36s]  All right, we're gonna go attack the other guard. I gotta follow flanker's lead here
[15225.60s -> 15228.48s]  The two guards leap into defensive positions
[15229.04s -> 15234.56s]  Wielding their halberds weapons with reach hard to defend against and capable of doing unusual amounts of damage
[15234.96s -> 15241.87s]  All in the three fucking damage move the guard raises halberd
[15242.19s -> 15247.47s]  He is clearly shaking with fear hardly surprising since flanker is already besting his comrade
[15248.17s -> 15252.81s]  You feel the weight of your sword and bring it round to slice deeply across his chest
[15253.05s -> 15257.10s]  The council guard responds with a tough blow balancing strength and impact
[15257.72s -> 15263.13s]  But he has misjudged your strength and you knock him back you catch him deep in the side
[15263.53s -> 15269.32s]  His tunic reddens well played friend flanker murmurs from the other side of the hall
[15270.16s -> 15276.57s]  You see his arm grow tense. He is readying for a strong attack. Be aware. He's gonna attack you with a strong attack
[15281.18s -> 15285.76s]  All right, ow
[15285.76s -> 15290.72s]  Okay, so that he used a lot. So we're gonna go with like a small one like two like three three point. Oh three point one
[15291.72s -> 15293.56s]  That's okay
[15293.56s -> 15298.32s]  Three point one time to attack you swing your sword fast
[15299.12s -> 15309.12s]  Pants heavily he's toying with you. All right, should I defend i'm going all in he's coming in hard
[15311.53s -> 15313.53s]  Fuck it hurts so bad
[15313.85s -> 15315.85s]  flanker is back seating you
[15316.99s -> 15322.35s]  You whip up your defenses as he attempts a strong stroke flanker turns from his own fight to laugh deeply
[15323.23s -> 15325.79s]  I see you've lost none of your powers of foresight
[15334.54s -> 15336.54s]  Uh, let's go like 1.8
[15338.38s -> 15340.96s]  All right. Now we go
[15340.96s -> 15345.84s]  Things are getting serious. The guard is now fighting for his life. You see his biceps tense. He's preparing to strike hard
[15346.40s -> 15348.92s]  more than six
[15348.92s -> 15350.12s]  Yes
[15350.12s -> 15353.42s]  What was that?
[15353.42s -> 15359.34s]  That was flanker and the other guy he was looking over laughing while clang clang clang clang clang clang with fighting the other guy
[15359.66s -> 15366.92s]  What do you mean? What was that? You know exactly what the hell that was. He's like
[15369.90s -> 15373.80s]  They're sword fighting next to me
[15373.80s -> 15375.68s]  All right
[15375.68s -> 15380.40s]  Uh, it is enough time to finish him the guard collapses backwards against the stone floor of the chamber
[15380.80s -> 15384.32s]  At the same time you hear a second scream. The other fight has ended as well
[15384.56s -> 15390.65s]  Flanker has cut his man down you and your comrade clean your blades
[15391.05s -> 15397.79s]  Flanker says a short prayer and then tastes a fingertip of blood from his victim opening the door
[15398.19s -> 15406.20s]  He gestures for you to go first council. This is the main council chamber
[15408.28s -> 15413.82s]  Rewind stop. Okay sip. Okay. Let's do that again
[15415.60s -> 15417.68s]  This is the main council chamber of caray
[15417.68s -> 15424.92s]  That's a hard sentence a wide room with a domed roof supported by tall pillars ornately carved with monsters
[15425.32s -> 15429.80s]  serpents and instruments of torture in the center
[15430.28s -> 15435.24s]  12 throne-like seats are arranged in a circle with one on a raised dais
[15436.09s -> 15443.88s]  Presumably the seat of the first noble all are empty a chalk circle has been drawn just inside the ring of thrones
[15444.70s -> 15456.24s]  Flanker frowns. This is not right walk around the chairs. You make a slow circle of the chairs
[15456.64s -> 15463.37s]  Flanker doing likewise in the other direction. No one here. No secret doors. No hidden passages
[15464.76s -> 15467.32s]  You notice the chairs all have names on their backs
[15467.56s -> 15475.10s]  The throne of the first noble has the name sansis embossed in gold leaf on its back
[15475.26s -> 15482.67s]  The names of the others are smaller and fashioned from plain iron mulas tiffin lorag shinva
[15483.07s -> 15488.35s]  Ziren and theta it would seem that none of the chairs have been satin for a very long time
[15489.69s -> 15498.80s]  Sitting the throne over the circle you approach the chalk circle. It appears to be just what it seems
[15499.28s -> 15504.86s]  A circle inscribed on the stone floor of the room. The only remarkable thing about it is how perfect it is
[15505.26s -> 15508.20s]  It is a flawless curve
[15508.60s -> 15511.78s]  Rather too well drawn that makes me suspicious
[15515.26s -> 15521.16s]  Don't fucking walk into the circle. Don't you dare i'm gonna sit in the throne
[15521.40s -> 15526.03s]  You walk back to the first noble's chair and lower yourself down
[15526.51s -> 15533.15s]  Crossing your legs and surveying the room. Flanker looks up from his forensic investigations of the chalk circle with amusement
[15533.47s -> 15539.08s]  Should I go in let's just should I go into it? I don't remember
[15541.96s -> 15548.56s]  I don't remember what happens does something bad happen? What happens? I don't remember
[15552.48s -> 15564.14s]  Leave leave leave is it I I think something bad happens. There is nothing here. This has been a waste of time
[15564.46s -> 15570.99s]  You remarked to flanker the assassin shakes his head. Perhaps i've learned something
[15571.60s -> 15580.99s]  He points to the circle on the floor. Do you see that? I think that is a portal trap. No, it's not
[15581.55s -> 15582.67s]  What's a portal trap?
[15582.67s -> 15590.28s]  The portal traps of kare will build to protect citizens in one area of kare from the citizens in other areas
[15591.20s -> 15598.81s]  Each region dwarf towns finnville the rest were given one trap to place as they saw fit and to move whenever they chose
[15599.61s -> 15607.42s]  Then if anyone from a neighboring town attacked they could not tell what was a trap and what wasn't so what is this doing here?
[15607.66s -> 15614.28s]  Now that is a very good question by all logic. It should not be here. They are quite invisible
[15614.52s -> 15623.60s]  They can appear as anything but should you stand in one you will be transported. But where are the nobles?
[15625.16s -> 15629.93s]  Blanker looks as puzzled as you I cannot believe they fell for their own trap
[15630.68s -> 15638.38s]  They are fools, but not such fools as that but here is a portal and they say sansis entered yet never left
[15641.87s -> 15647.92s]  Transported where you ask looking at the chalk circle of curiosity wherever the center chooses
[15648.62s -> 15653.00s]  Inside solid rock high in midair the tradition in kare has been to dump
[15653.38s -> 15656.67s]  Unfortunates into the sewers most do not come back
[15657.74s -> 15659.98s]  Blanker moves suddenly towards the door then turns to you
[15660.22s -> 15672.80s]  But the important thing about traps is that they are no longer under the control of the people of kare who controls them now
[15673.76s -> 15681.47s]  Your naivety is most pleasing. What do you think when a people is given something of power who takes that thing away?
[15682.24s -> 15687.48s]  The nobles of course for many years now every trap in kare has been moved and placed
[15687.96s -> 15697.40s]  By sansis himself and where is sansis now? He's not here indeed indeed not
[15698.75s -> 15704.28s]  Blanker turns about once more. I have seen enough. I must think on what we've seen
[15709.69s -> 15716.04s]  So why are the guards here? Are the guards just sitting here? The guards were just outside the door?
[15718.30s -> 15724.89s]  No, you can't you can't go there. Sorry. They're it's in session right now. How long were they there for?
[15727.76s -> 15732.49s]  We just killed two random guards for absolutely. No reason. They were just npc guards
[15734.24s -> 15744.94s]  They were just hanging out. I could step into it. Should I step i'm going in i'll remind if it sucks
[15747.29s -> 15750.09s]  With his attention turned you take a deep breath you step towards the chalk circle
[15750.17s -> 15752.35s]  You feel nothing as you cross the boundary
[15752.35s -> 15764.48s]  But one moment you are in the council chamber and your foot touches nothing inside and you are falling back in the sewer
[15772.41s -> 15796.32s]  Shit, all right back it up. No, no, no, no, no, don't do it twice. No back up. Okay. There we go
[15799.76s -> 15803.64s]  Oh, we have to do this again. It's fine. And that's probably i'm gonna call it here
[15803.88s -> 15807.13s]  I mentioned that I wanted to do more streams this week
[15807.13s -> 15812.92s]  But less time because i'm still not feeling great and i've got to go do something. I got something I have to do
[15813.64s -> 15815.96s]  Uh that might take a while. So sorry
[15817.08s -> 15821.16s]  Sorry
[15821.16s -> 15822.84s]  So if you weren't here at the beginning of the stream
[15822.84s -> 15828.33s]  I said that I was only going to go for like three or four hours and we were going to stream tomorrow and thursday and then saturday
[15832.35s -> 15838.09s]  I'm going to get to this point here. So tomorrow we're going to just pick up right where we left off here
[15839.12s -> 15848.48s]  We are absolutely going to get through part two tomorrow and likely start at least the beginning of part three thursday something else is happening
[15849.82s -> 15853.20s]  Which I don't I can't really talk about right now because I don't know
[15853.84s -> 15855.84s]  Exactly, what is going to happen?
[15856.64s -> 15862.88s]  So I don't want to like talk about something that either does or doesn't happen, but should be fun and then saturday
[15864.25s -> 15879.04s]  Is green screen movie night part two? Is it a sponsored stream? No, it's not something else. But yeah, we're um,
[15879.44s -> 15888.65s]  We'll be back. We'll be back tomorrow and I say we and I mean me maybe you if you come back and watch
[15889.61s -> 15894.97s]  Okay, cool. That makes me suspicious. Let's leave. There's nothing here portal traps. Yes. What does that do add clues?
[15895.05s -> 15902.35s]  What does it look like interesting? Oh, okay transported where can you avoid them? How where the nobles I don't know
[15902.75s -> 15910.51s]  Where does a trap go? I don't know who controls them. Why is there a trap here? Who is I gotta get all this info?
[15910.75s -> 15916.00s]  Okay, let's get out of here. All right, so blanker and I are leaving the council chamber
[15919.39s -> 15924.32s]  And we are gonna call it right here when I get out
[15927.05s -> 15932.89s]  The road climbs further looping back on itself as it climbs several little alleys disappear off between homes and buildings on either side
[15933.29s -> 15940.83s]  This area of town is a spider's web that would be easy to lose oneself in you pass a shop with a brass sign above its door
[15941.39s -> 15955.07s]  Metal workers guild. However, it seems to be closed for the night. Oh, it's closed. Okay
[15956.35s -> 15966.09s]  Uh, I sneezed and i'm gonna sneeze again. So we'll call it here
[15966.49s -> 15972.00s]  We need to go remind me tomorrow that we need to go down here. This is the next
[15982.52s -> 15985.23s]  destination
[15985.23s -> 15989.47s]  So this is where we're gonna go. It's a bit
[15990.35s -> 15997.04s]  I mean, I really am sneezing but i'm pressing the view button a little like a half second too late, right?
[16000.89s -> 16003.21s]  We need to go to the falling quarter get the last line
[16004.14s -> 16012.03s]  And then I will tell you if we get the last line down here for the first time in me ever playing sorcery
[16012.51s -> 16014.81s]  Will I leave kare?
[16014.81s -> 16019.93s]  Without just saying fuck it. I don't care lorag come with me. This would be this would be the first time
[16020.80s -> 16026.56s]  So that's cool. I usually just go through it and go. Ah, whatever. I don't care and then just keep going
[16029.04s -> 16031.52s]  Okay, that's it. We'll see you guys tomorrow. We're gonna complete part two
[16031.52s -> 16033.68s]  We'll do a little bit part three and then some other stuff
[16034.59s -> 16039.76s]  We'll take a break from sorcery. Uh this coming week and we'll see if you guys really like it
[16039.84s -> 16043.52s]  I mean this seems like a lot of people are just having fun hanging out. It's a chill thing to do
[16044.81s -> 16046.56s]  it's really just

[16092.54s -> 16103.66s]  I wonder what what could we do next week if we could if we finish part two of sorcery tomorrow start part three
[16104.43s -> 16108.56s]  Do this thing on thursday potentially green screen on saturday
[16109.85s -> 16111.92s]  um
