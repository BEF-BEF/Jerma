[1.53s -> 12.76s]  Hello everybody. My name is Hill Joe Gullum. I'm Jeremy's, um, his, his grandfather.
[12.76s -> 21.22s]  And today we're gonna play Insane Aquarium, Zootilux mode. It's the best game you can ever buy.
[22.34s -> 29.03s]  And it's loading it right now. I don't really play video games, they hurt my brain.
[30.41s -> 33.69s]  And I wish this noise, we gotta click here to play, okay.
[34.49s -> 39.50s]  Gee, I play casual games, because I'm an idiot. I'm just...
[42.06s -> 49.50s]  Okay, what am I doing here? Um, I wanna do challenge mode, because I, I'm,
[49.50s -> 54.94s]  know I want a new game. New fucking game. Okay, let's try tank number three,
[55.02s -> 61.29s]  because I still can't beat it. I like to use the crab, and I like to use the other crab,
[61.85s -> 66.49s]  and I like to use the floating crab, well, you know, to get the money in the beginning, you know.
[67.53s -> 74.17s]  Okay, so it starts, you click to feed these little fish-faced fucks, and then, you know,
[75.05s -> 81.30s]  they drop the dog shit, and you click it, and you get money, and you click again, and you get more
[81.30s -> 89.26s]  money, and then my game is lagging really badly right now. Click that money right there.
[90.71s -> 94.47s]  The whole point of this, by the way, folks, is you wanna try and get as much money,
[95.27s -> 100.95s]  so you can pay for your daughter's wedding. At least that's, that's what I pretended is.
[103.03s -> 109.11s]  Okay, so we got four fishies here, and they're all dumping out dog shit. And I got my little
[109.11s -> 114.79s]  friend Steve over here, I think that's his name. So the whole point is you wanna give these guys
[114.79s -> 128.86s]  the delicious worm cakes, and hold on a minute, I have to diarrhea. Okay, okay, I'm back from
[128.86s -> 140.46s]  diarrhea-ing, and uh, I got a big fishy here now, and this is uh, uh oh. Oh fuck, somebody
[140.46s -> 147.66s]  fucking died, and I got an alien, oh this is bad. You're gonna shoot these fucking aliens! Oh my god.
[149.18s -> 157.91s]  Oh Jesus Christ. Don't worry everybody, I got a fucking diamond. So that means we can buy
[157.91s -> 168.55s]  extra food. $315? Are you fucking kidding me? $318 for food? Oh, you gotta be shitting me.
[169.11s -> 175.86s]  Whatever, I'll just let it keep going. So I'm, I'm doing pretty well here, I got a big fish here.
[177.06s -> 183.78s]  Like I told you, like I told you before, I'm making lots of cash. I might wanna upgrade
[184.42s -> 189.22s]  my food quality. Oh shit, gotta pick that up. And the silver ones too, remember,
[189.22s -> 194.34s]  silver's worth something too here, you know. I don't know what this fucking face is for,
[194.34s -> 202.04s]  I don't know who the guppy is, guppy cruncher. But uh, okay, time to figure out, I need another fish.
[202.04s -> 212.09s]  What the fuck? Hold, hold on just a second! You, what is this? This game is a, is a bunch of
[212.17s -> 219.93s]  bullshit! Oh my, you gotta be, whatever. You know, I'm returning this game.
[221.69s -> 230.87s]  I'm gonna return this game today. And oh, hello there Susie. What's your name? Never seen you.
[231.67s -> 242.10s]  What was I just saying about, oh yeah, um, I think I was saying I was gonna play challenge mode and
[242.10s -> 249.19s]  I needed to beat tank three because I didn't beat tank three yet. Okay, okay, I like to pick crab
[249.19s -> 258.15s]  and other crab and this crab. Okay, uh, the point of this game is you want to feed these fishes
[258.87s -> 266.33s]  and collect the dog shit. And the whole point is you want to try and feed them. And uh, and like
[266.65s -> 278.79s]  you gotta be careful because aliens come up and uh, what is it? I'm playing a fucking video game!
[281.27s -> 283.03s]  I don't care! You can go to hell!
[286.36s -> 296.20s]  Oh, okay, I'll be up for dinner in a minute, okay. So like, okay, like I was saying,
[296.20s -> 308.58s]  oops, all of your fish have died.
