[0.31s -> 13.14s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jermok here with Facecam Fortress 2.
[13.14s -> 19.32s]  The first episode in quite a long time, as most of you will probably recall.
[19.32s -> 23.25s]  The kit. Pyros.
[23.25s -> 28.55s]  Playing on pipeline, as you can probably tell, Sniper, you're gonna die in 3, 2,
[28.55s -> 30.55s]  Oh, even before the countdown ended?
[30.55s -> 36.50s]  He did not see a 150 on me. Did you? Oh!
[36.50s -> 40.45s]  Did you see that 150? Spy, get out of my face!
[41.82s -> 45.76s]  And just like that, you can get like 4 kills in a row.
[45.76s -> 47.76s]  What are we voting on? Kick somebody?
[47.76s -> 50.90s]  I don't know. Should we kick this guy?
[50.90s -> 55.78s]  I need health. I forget what the health is in pipeline. I'm such an idiot.
[55.78s -> 59.98s]  Oh, watch this. Watch this.
[59.98s -> 62.98s]  Oh, that's all he needed to do! What's wrong with me?
[62.98s -> 67.16s]  If he had gotten one tiny little pellet on me, he would have killed me.
[67.16s -> 68.16s]  And he did.
[68.16s -> 72.91s]  God damn it, Jerma. Sometimes I just want to fart in your face.
[72.91s -> 74.91s]  Get up! Do something!
[74.91s -> 78.67s]  Jump on his jump over there!
[78.67s -> 79.67s]  Come on, come on, come on, we lost.
[79.67s -> 91.10s]  Oh, I didn't even say like, I'm using the direct hit, and I have,
[91.10s -> 96.67s]  Hold on.
[96.67s -> 101.79s]  Flying Pyro! Flying Pyro!
[101.79s -> 107.10s]  I probably should mention the hat I'm wearing too.
[107.10s -> 111.41s]  It's this weird, like, stupid Pilgrim hat that was in my closet.
[111.41s -> 116.89s]  I think I wore this in a very old Facecam Fortress from like at least a year ago.
[116.89s -> 121.82s]  So if you see this hat again, and you recognize it, then hell yeah, do it.
[121.82s -> 124.57s]  I'm wearing an old hat. Where are you going?
[124.57s -> 126.58s]  Where are you going?
[126.58s -> 128.58s]  Where are you going with your goddamn sweater vest?
[128.58s -> 133.10s]  We did it. We got it. Get the health.
[133.10s -> 139.78s]  Pick the health up. You just called.
[139.78s -> 143.92s]  This guy's calling for a doctor, and he's looking at the health pack.
[143.92s -> 148.89s]  We're getting smoked again. All right, I'm going to put my tri-hot pants on.
[148.89s -> 152.75s]  No more messing around. No more messing around.
[152.75s -> 153.75s]  Come on, get me out there. Get me out there.
[153.75s -> 155.75s]  I'm going to kill everybody that's out there. Come on.
[155.75s -> 159.38s]  I'm going to land every single direct hit shot when I get out there.
[159.38s -> 167.85s]  Everybody watch this. Here we go.
[167.85s -> 168.85s]  Oh, we'll just get spawn camped.
[168.85s -> 177.27s]  Oh, do you see? I picked up the guy's brass beast.
[178.96s -> 184.12s]  Using my detective work, I think he died up there.
[184.12s -> 186.12s]  All right, let's actually win this goddamn round.
[186.12s -> 189.68s]  Well, can that be a thing? Can we win a match, please?
[189.68s -> 192.24s]  Should I change off direct hit? I don't know.
[192.24s -> 197.74s]  No, I'm not going to change off it.
[197.74s -> 203.27s]  These two guys are running around with their BS.
[203.27s -> 209.61s]  Oh my God, this is too hard.
[209.61s -> 212.87s]  Oh, death from above.
[212.87s -> 220.41s]  Got to hit that medic.
[220.41s -> 227.05s]  There you go, Sergeant. Nice try.
[227.05s -> 230.12s]  Don't let him get you with that.
[230.12s -> 236.66s]  I'm going to go down and defend the actual burp cop.
[236.66s -> 237.66s]  That guy got wrecked.
[237.66s -> 239.22s]  That guy.
[239.22s -> 242.77s]  Look, look, look.
[242.77s -> 243.77s]  Oh, come on.
[243.77s -> 251.15s]  Come on and get this.
[251.15s -> 256.12s]  Will you land a shot?
[256.12s -> 266.23s]  So in the land of...
[266.23s -> 268.23s]  This is my password book.
[268.23s -> 270.30s]  Oh my God.
[270.30s -> 274.30s]  I almost showed my passwords on screen.
[274.30s -> 276.30s]  I was going to do a thing where I...
[276.30s -> 280.66s]  I got to go on a complete rampage right here.
[280.66s -> 282.66s]  I have to make this happen.
[282.66s -> 286.11s]  Put on your pants.
[286.11s -> 288.11s]  Even though I'm not wearing any pants right now,
[288.11s -> 290.61s]  I'm wearing just like underwear.
[290.61s -> 291.61s]  This is what I do.
[291.61s -> 292.61s]  Whenever I want to do like a face game video,
[292.61s -> 294.61s]  I'm like, God, but I got to put pants on.
[294.61s -> 295.78s]  No, you don't.
[295.78s -> 297.78s]  Because like all you can see is like right here.
[297.78s -> 299.78s]  The magic of video editing.
[299.78s -> 303.69s]  I'll get out of here.
[303.69s -> 307.91s]  Get you little pricks.
[307.91s -> 309.47s]  Don't worry.
[309.47s -> 310.47s]  Don't worry.
[310.47s -> 311.84s]  Don't worry.
[311.84s -> 312.84s]  Don't worry.
[312.84s -> 322.57s]  Oh, I wonder what's going to happen in this round.
[322.57s -> 325.00s]  We're going to get steamrolled.
[325.00s -> 328.00s]  Is that really a surprise to anybody on this team?
[328.00s -> 333.31s]  This is just ridiculous.
[333.31s -> 337.30s]  Keep them off.
[337.30s -> 338.30s]  Come here, dude.
[338.30s -> 339.74s]  Come here.
[339.74s -> 342.51s]  There you go.
[342.51s -> 343.82s]  There you go, beef.
[343.82s -> 344.82s]  Get this...
[344.82s -> 345.82s]  Get me off me, beef.
[345.82s -> 347.38s]  Come on, beef.
[347.38s -> 348.38s]  Somebody kill this guy.
[348.38s -> 349.38s]  Somebody kill this son of a bitch.
[349.38s -> 352.19s]  Thank you so much.
[352.19s -> 353.19s]  Oh, I need health.
[353.19s -> 356.78s]  Abandon the team.
[356.78s -> 359.59s]  I don't think we're going to win this,
[359.59s -> 367.46s]  but at least we're probably going to have the match go longer than 30 seconds.
[367.46s -> 369.46s]  All right, let's do this after this Uber wears off.
[369.46s -> 372.98s]  Don't let the heavy die.
[372.98s -> 374.92s]  He's going to die.
[374.92s -> 376.67s]  The heavy is going to die.
[376.67s -> 378.67s]  Oh, goodness.
[378.67s -> 379.67s]  Oh, goodness.
[379.67s -> 380.67s]  Oh, goodness.
[380.67s -> 381.67s]  Come on, overdose.
[381.67s -> 385.26s]  Overdose, you got to pull through here.
[385.26s -> 387.50s]  Come on, overdose.
[387.50s -> 390.08s]  Just do something.
[390.08s -> 392.54s]  There it is.
[392.54s -> 393.54s]  There it is, baby.
[393.54s -> 394.54s]  Come on, do it again.
[394.54s -> 397.84s]  Oh, my goodness gracious, beef.
[397.84s -> 398.84s]  Beef.
[398.84s -> 402.36s]  Look at this guy going absolutely beast.
[402.36s -> 403.36s]  That's how you do it right there.
[403.36s -> 406.58s]  I got you.
[406.58s -> 408.66s]  I got you.
[408.66s -> 409.66s]  Watch out.
[409.66s -> 412.69s]  We got to watch out.
[412.69s -> 413.69s]  Get him out of the spawn.
[413.69s -> 418.42s]  That went right by my face.
[418.42s -> 420.18s]  Let's go.
[420.18s -> 423.63s]  Somebody got to get that sniper that's up there.
[423.63s -> 425.32s]  You prick.
[425.32s -> 426.32s]  You know what?
[426.32s -> 429.86s]  I should probably go get him.
[429.86s -> 431.81s]  Turn around.
[431.81s -> 435.84s]  You want to play that game?
[435.84s -> 436.84s]  You want to play that game?
[436.84s -> 437.84s]  That's fine.
[437.84s -> 442.02s]  All right.
[442.02s -> 443.02s]  Wait.
[443.02s -> 445.48s]  Holy hell.
[445.48s -> 446.48s]  Help me.
[446.48s -> 449.96s]  Somebody help me.
[449.96s -> 451.71s]  Oh, boy.
[451.71s -> 452.71s]  I'm going to have to use this.
[452.71s -> 457.54s]  Keep it going.
[457.54s -> 458.54s]  Shoot some down that hall.
[458.54s -> 461.89s]  It's all right.
[461.89s -> 462.89s]  It's all right.
[462.89s -> 464.88s]  Nice job.
[464.88s -> 465.88s]  Nice job.
[465.88s -> 467.70s]  It's okay.
[467.70s -> 468.70s]  We got to move this guy.
[468.70s -> 471.54s]  I'm dead.
[471.54s -> 473.95s]  What is this guy doing up here?
[473.95s -> 474.95s]  Oh, my God.
[474.95s -> 475.95s]  Free overcharge.
[475.95s -> 480.58s]  Come on.
[480.58s -> 481.58s]  I don't want to crit him.
[481.58s -> 497.83s]  Get him, Iron Man.
[497.83s -> 498.83s]  Watch out, Heidi.
[498.83s -> 499.83s]  They got two medics.
[499.83s -> 503.12s]  Two asshole medics.
[503.12s -> 504.12s]  That crit.
[504.12s -> 507.09s]  Not fair.
[507.09s -> 509.29s]  Push it.
[509.29s -> 510.29s]  Push it.
[510.29s -> 511.53s]  Push it.
[511.53s -> 512.53s]  Push it.
[512.53s -> 515.79s]  Remember, guys, what you're seeing right now is what happens when somebody goes medic.
[515.79s -> 522.33s]  When one goddamn person on your team goes medic, you can win the game.
[522.33s -> 526.65s]  That's a good PSA right there, because we were just getting destroyed the entire time.
[526.65s -> 529.69s]  And then we had one medic on our team, and we won the game.
[529.69s -> 530.85s]  So that's going to wrap it up here, guys.
[530.85s -> 533.97s]  Thank you all so much for watching Face Game Fortress 2, and I'll see you all next time.
[533.97s -> 537.13s]  And of course, how messy is my hair?
[537.13s -> 538.13s]  Take care, everybody.
