[0.70s -> 4.60s]  I don't know. I have no idea what happened. I told like to reverse countdown.
[6.65s -> 18.73s]  And my fucking stream just turned on. So that's the new feature. Okay. Yep. I'll see you later.
[19.94s -> 23.06s]  I guess I have to do something. I don't know. I wasn't playing on stream for like another four hours.
[24.41s -> 30.58s]  All right. Yep. Hey, what's happening everybody? Welcome to the stream.
[31.22s -> 37.51s]  Oh, we're starting. This is when I, this is when I'm starting. Stream in orbit soon.
[38.07s -> 49.37s]  All right. Uh, actually give me one second. I need to move a few windows. See you in a minute or two.
[112.87s -> 121.06s]  All right. So today we're doing something, uh, kind of just came out of the blue for no reason
[121.06s -> 127.26s]  last week. Just decided that this is what we're going to do today and probably tomorrow too.
[127.26s -> 134.20s]  Depends on how much fun everybody thinks this is. I think it's going to be fun. We're going to do
[134.20s -> 140.12s]  heroes of might and magic three. I know it's kind of odd that it was just white. Wait, why are you
[140.12s -> 145.11s]  playing this right now? Well, it just kind of came up. I remembered how much I loved this game
[146.20s -> 150.09s]  and we're going to play it. This is going to be a real comfortable stream.
[150.81s -> 158.25s]  Now I'm going to be passing out blankets and, uh, eye masks over the course of this stream flight.
[158.97s -> 167.70s]  Feel free. By the way, they're all, they're all, um, $6. So, I mean, I'm not going to be passing
[167.70s -> 178.60s]  them out. I mean, you're going to be paying for them as I walk by in the aisle. Don't make,
[178.60s -> 183.50s]  don't make any loud noises. Are you like, no, no, you can't like make like a loud noise,
[183.50s -> 191.90s]  like on any transportation. Don't make any loud noises and just watch the screen. We will be
[191.90s -> 207.86s]  arriving in Amsterdam in about 12 hours. So have a good trip here. Stream trip. Why are we going to
[207.86s -> 216.74s]  Amsterdam? It was the first, it was first like city and like European place I could think of
[217.38s -> 221.72s]  in the 10 seconds I was reaching for one. But yeah, we're going to play. Uh, this is a classic
[221.72s -> 225.88s]  game. Uh, a lot of people are going to be confused when we first play cause there's a lot going on
[225.88s -> 230.68s]  in the game. And I even don't know a shitload of the stuff that's going on in this game.
[231.32s -> 237.48s]  I loved this game when I was a kid, when I was a teenager and I didn't even fucking understand
[237.48s -> 242.20s]  any of the nuances and the complex systems that could potentially be in the game. I just clicked
[242.20s -> 246.36s]  on stuff and I had fun and I have a basic understanding and I haven't played in a long
[246.36s -> 255.34s]  time. So we're going in with like 14 year old brain into 34 year old body and then
[255.98s -> 260.65s]  teleport to 2019. So why don't we just show it on the screen so you can see what it looks
[260.65s -> 263.77s]  like. There it is. Here is a might and magic. Let's get the music turned on. It's a pretty
[263.77s -> 276.92s]  good soundtrack. One, two, three. It's Mr. Worldwide over here. Yeah. I know you're getting loud.
[276.92s -> 282.38s]  You're getting loud. Quiet down. There's no dancing in the aisles either. I'm seeing,
[282.38s -> 295.56s]  I'm seeing dancing, please. You're not dancing. Sit down in your seats. Stop. Okay. Fucking dumb
[295.56s -> 302.63s]  plane that would be. And you're like just on a plane or like a, like a nine hour plane and
[302.63s -> 305.59s]  you're just sitting in your seat with your iPad and people are just fucking dancing.
[307.27s -> 318.73s]  You'd just be like, sit down. All right. Here we go. I think there's a campaign in the game,
[318.73s -> 323.13s]  but I don't know if I'm going to do it. I feel like I'd rather do one of the random scenarios
[323.21s -> 331.48s]  because I've never clicked this button. I've played this game dozens and dozens of times
[331.48s -> 340.97s]  over years. I've never selected this button. I think we can keep it that way. So this is
[342.33s -> 350.46s]  random scenario. This is all for one. Let's see available scenarios because you can do random
[350.46s -> 357.56s]  map. You can do random scenarios and they all are different completely. You can have up to like
[357.56s -> 362.49s]  eight people in a game. There's no multiplayer on this one, unfortunately,
[362.49s -> 376.14s]  because it is the old version. Rush the capital. I want to play. I want to play. Let us in. You
[376.14s -> 382.36s]  can't, what do you mean let us in? This is not pirated version. I bought this from good old games.
[383.91s -> 390.41s]  Don't pirate this. Buy it. It's good. It's worth your $10. I don't think we can smart click this.
[390.41s -> 395.66s]  Let's just find an interesting one. Do this Warlords. I'll read them for you. All right.
[395.66s -> 399.82s]  Here we go. I'm going to read, how many are there? I'm not going to read them all. That's too many.
[399.82s -> 407.26s]  Let's find one that I think is cool and then I'll read it out loud. Let us click. The bubble
[407.26s -> 414.10s]  won't even be here. If you click here, you're going to click here and here and here. No,
[414.10s -> 421.69s]  I'm clicking one. A brave new world. A great upheaval shook the very foundations of the world,
[421.69s -> 426.57s]  breaking apart continents and dividing territories in new ways. After the earth stood still once
[426.57s -> 431.13s]  more, the people crawled out from their hiding places. They began to rebuild in this brave new
[431.13s -> 442.38s]  world. No one's clicking. Sit down in your seats. Yada, yada, yada. No one's clicking on my screen.
[442.38s -> 448.74s]  Okay. No one's clicking once and we need to do map size. Let's do like medium. This is the first,
[449.30s -> 455.93s]  okay. This is the first scenario. I just need to show you guys how to play. Here,
[455.93s -> 467.22s]  like how about this one? Like deluge. I need to get back into the swinging thing.
[467.22s -> 471.78s]  Pick elbow. All right. I could do that. This world ain't big enough. No, no, no. This is
[471.78s -> 477.11s]  going to be too hard. All right. Here we go. I'm just going to do random scenario. Here we go.
[477.11s -> 484.15s]  I'm going for it. Um, let's go for, uh, I don't know. Let's, um, roll the dice. Here we go. One,
[484.15s -> 491.46s]  two, three. Start, starting here. Just to visit. Emerald Isles. Step by step. Harsh winter. Uh,
[491.46s -> 496.30s]  rumble in the bogs. Carpe diem. Seize the day. A few years back, the gods decided they no longer
[496.30s -> 500.06s]  wanted any part in this world. Now there is total anarchy. Everybody blames everyone else for the
[500.06s -> 504.30s]  gods abandoning them while sitting in the throne room. You decided you were the only person fit to
[504.30s -> 517.75s]  rule. Carpe diem. Here we go. Uh, lose, defeat everybody, kill everybody. And we've got player,
[517.75s -> 524.23s]  uh, difficulty is on 160%. I don't want that. I just want it on like a hundred percent or just
[524.23s -> 529.27s]  right in the middle. What does this mean? I don't know what that means. I know what that means. I
[529.27s -> 541.42s]  don't know what this one means. I'm not going all the way up here. 130. Rumble. Rumble in the bogs.
[541.42s -> 552.62s]  It's difficulty scaling. So this should just be right in the middle. 130. I'll take it. I'm not
[552.62s -> 556.60s]  going to max it. I'm not for the first one. All right, here we go. Ready? What about advanced
[556.60s -> 561.22s]  options? Oh shit. Hold on. Starting town. Oh, that's important. This is important. This is me.
[561.22s -> 572.65s]  I need to pick my flag. Which flag do I want to be? Do I want to be red, blue, um, sand, green,
[572.65s -> 583.74s]  orange, or purple? Green. All right. Starting town. Uh, we can pick starting towns here. I think
[583.74s -> 588.60s]  we should just do, should we just do, what do you think? Who should I be? Who should I start as?
[588.60s -> 602.60s]  Should I be? Oh, here we go. Okay. That's all I needed to see. All right. Uh, where do I want to
[602.60s -> 608.89s]  go? Town alignment. Castle. Associated creatures. Pipeman, archer, griffin, uh, the swordsman,
[608.89s -> 614.92s]  the monk, the cavalier, and the angel. There's, okay, so this is kind of standard fantasy, uh,
[614.92s -> 621.70s]  knights and archers and griffins. This one is more fan, like fantasy creatures like dwarves and
[621.70s -> 627.45s]  elves and centaurs and unicorns. Uh, this is the tower. So is this, this is like a fantasy
[627.45s -> 635.35s]  styled creatures. Gremlin, gargoyle, golem, mage, genie. I think I want this one. This inferno is a
[635.35s -> 640.92s]  little geared more towards like high fantasy. So you have imp, uh, gog, hellhound, demon,
[643.80s -> 653.72s]  pit fiend. That's kind of cool. Necropolis. I don't have any other way to describe anything.
[653.72s -> 663.91s]  Um, this is a, I don't know. I like this one though. Skeletons, lich, black, uh, black knight,
[663.91s -> 676.04s]  bone dragon, harpy beholder, medusa, goblin. These are like orcs, gnoll, lizard van, serpent fly,
[677.67s -> 686.01s]  firebird, elementals. All right. I think I'm going to go with the gremlins. I think so.
[686.01s -> 699.42s]  The tower. We get gremlins. We get stone golems. We get mages. Oh, should I need a new? Hmm. I
[699.42s -> 706.20s]  like this one. That's just the, you took a photo of me and I'm not photogenic and I wasn't ready
[706.20s -> 714.10s]  for it. And that's how we look at every picture. Torosar. I need a better name. So we rename. I
[714.10s -> 728.30s]  don't think we can rename Torosar. I think that's good. Everybody else can be random. That's fine.
[728.30s -> 735.19s]  We don't need to do any of this. That's where we're going to start. Everyone else's computer
[735.19s -> 746.62s]  and we're on normal difficulty. Three, two, one. It is your belief that the gods didn't
[746.62s -> 751.34s]  abandon their people, but the people have abandoned their gods. To bring the gods back,
[751.34s -> 759.86s]  you must make the people believe in the gods again by force if necessary. Here is your castle. This
[759.86s -> 767.58s]  is where you stand. This is your stronghold. Here's the map. It goes eons and eons and light years
[767.58s -> 772.46s]  away from you. You step out of the castle and you see, I'm not going to narrate this whole thing.
[773.64s -> 779.05s]  So here's my magic. If you want to know how this works, do not be deceived by this initial
[779.05s -> 783.93s]  overworld map. Oh, it's a click game and you click around and you, oh, look at that. Oh, it's fun.
[783.93s -> 789.13s]  No, no, there's way more than that. There's a whole full combat system, 2D and potentially 3D.
[789.13s -> 796.82s]  This is an isometric 3D. The game works based around exploring and getting stronger and leveling
[796.82s -> 801.54s]  up and leveling up your creatures and having thousands of them and having them fight. I hope
[801.54s -> 810.28s]  you're ready for the best fucking game you will ever see ever in your entire life on this channel.
[810.28s -> 816.47s]  Here we go. So let's go look at the castle. This is our, where we are right now. This is who we
[816.47s -> 828.84s]  have. We have the fucking random, I like hate this guy already. So we have 31 gremlins. They're like
[828.92s -> 837.75s]  jesters. Okay. They, uh, 31 of them. We've got three stone golems. There are 16 available gremlins
[837.75s -> 844.74s]  right now. That's too many gremlins to have. No, I want like 500 of them. Not playing as the
[844.74s -> 849.62s]  skeletons. Dropped. Well, this is the first scenario. We can play more scenarios. I'm excited.
[849.62s -> 857.78s]  I'm like, emotions are overwhelming me right now. How this works is these are all the monsters we
[857.78s -> 863.40s]  can eventually make. Eventually we can have just giant guy with like a lightsaber. It's awesome.
[863.40s -> 869.51s]  The genies, the mages, stone gargoyles. This is a lot of cool things. And these are the most,
[869.51s -> 873.43s]  obviously, most powerful units you can make. But for the purposes of what's happening here,
[873.43s -> 880.44s]  this is your tree. Yep. It's a tree. All of these have a function and they all cost a certain amount
[880.44s -> 885.64s]  of resources. So for instance, the blacksmith, uh, the blacksmith provides your armies with
[885.64s -> 892.25s]  ammo carts. Okay. Well that's a thousand gold and five wood. I got 15 wood. You get resources by
[892.25s -> 903.00s]  claiming territory or by trading it or by finding it. Are we understanding here? You can upgrade
[903.00s -> 911.42s]  your tower. You can upgrade your buildings and bases many, many times. This is a cool mobile ad
[911.42s -> 916.74s]  stream. Now I'm just taking it slow because people are going to have a lot of questions.
[916.74s -> 923.06s]  Let's do it very good. Okay. Golem factory. The golem factory allows you to recruit stone golems.
[923.06s -> 929.86s]  It's five wood, five, um, hair balls and $2,000. I'm going to get that because I want to be able
[929.86s -> 939.21s]  to start having goblins, goblins. Here we go. There it is right there. Six of these are recruited a
[939.21s -> 954.50s]  week. I can buy six per week. It's 900 bucks. As you see, I'm going to buy them. I'm going to
[954.50s -> 962.10s]  recruit them right now. Here we go. See now we got a nine. If you don't leave anything here,
[962.10s -> 969.72s]  your castle can be claimed by other people. So if I don't have, for instance, if I can put, um,
[969.72s -> 976.02s]  like, oh, let's put, uh, you can split them up too. So I'm going to leave, uh, I'll leave like two,
[976.58s -> 980.55s]  I'll leave two of these guys here. Now they're going to get wiped out of the castle that has
[980.55s -> 985.62s]  ever breached. Who cares, right? I don't need anybody defending the castle right now. I'm
[985.62s -> 991.74s]  going to just take everybody. But this is where you do most of your maintenance. Now you probably,
[991.74s -> 995.90s]  oh, that was fucking awesome, Jeremy. Like, holy shit, that was the fucking coolest thing you've
[995.90s -> 1002.71s]  ever shown us. I know. So here we go. Ready? You go by, uh, you can only go a certain amount of
[1002.71s -> 1011.64s]  paces per turn, right? So here's how far I can move. Every single one of these things is
[1011.64s -> 1017.32s]  interactable and they have consequences. They have choices. There are a pack of wood elves here and
[1017.32s -> 1021.40s]  there's something behind them. A monolith one-way entrance. I don't even know what the fuck that is.
[1021.40s -> 1026.23s]  I have no idea what that is. I wish I could tell you what that was. I don't know if I'm,
[1026.23s -> 1030.39s]  a pack of wood elves, we might be able to kill them. I don't know. Maybe I'll try.
[1030.39s -> 1037.78s]  First of all, let's pick up this, uh, this treasure chest. Oh, after scouring the area,
[1037.78s -> 1041.62s]  you fall upon a hidden treasure trash. You may take the gold or distribute it to the
[1041.62s -> 1045.69s]  peasants for experience. Which do you choose? This is important because you can take money
[1045.69s -> 1049.77s]  and be able to buy things, or you can take experience, which levels up your hero,
[1049.77s -> 1056.28s]  which then lets you put skill points in, which lets you do more, better things.
[1056.28s -> 1065.48s]  I think I'm going to do experience. You have to pick this every time. Let's pick experience.
[1065.48s -> 1074.31s]  Bingo. Taurosar is now level two alchemist. Spell power plus one. Or, well, no, this is,
[1074.31s -> 1078.87s]  you can pick one of these two. You can pick either advanced tactics or basic ballistics.
[1080.18s -> 1087.26s]  I don't know what those are. Just sit on. Advanced tactics allow you to rearrange your troops just
[1087.26s -> 1093.00s]  before combat within five hex rows of the commanding hero. Fuck man. That sounds pretty
[1093.00s -> 1098.34s]  good. Basic ballistics gives control of the catapult to the hero, allowing aim shots with
[1098.34s -> 1103.00s]  increased damage. That's if you're breaching buildings, if you're breaching towers. Um,
[1103.00s -> 1107.27s]  I don't know. They both sound pretty good. I would probably say basic ballistics because that's
[1107.27s -> 1115.19s]  how you really take over capsules very well. You sound so excited. I love this game. This is like
[1115.19s -> 1120.47s]  one of my favorite things ever. This, this is like, uh, yeah, this is what like a sponsored stream
[1120.47s -> 1124.79s]  would sound like. But this is like a, I'm sponsoring this game. You know what I mean?
[1124.79s -> 1131.18s]  Like I'm sponsoring this stream. It's me. I'm going to do ballistics. You know what I'm saying?
[1131.18s -> 1136.66s]  This is me sponsoring this game. They're not sponsoring me. I'm sponsoring them. I bought
[1136.66s -> 1142.73s]  this game for 10 bucks and I'm telling you to play it. All right. So we've got a scholar here.
[1142.73s -> 1146.25s]  Ooh, I don't know what to do because I only get a certain amount of things I can do per turn.
[1146.25s -> 1151.54s]  Remember, this is very important. Everybody listen to me and stop talking during class.
[1151.54s -> 1159.29s]  Oh, Dave, back there. We don't, there's no food allowed in the classroom. And, uh, Karen, Karen,
[1159.29s -> 1164.62s]  you like to pass notes, huh? Is that what you're doing? Oh, let's see. Let me see that. Let me see
[1164.62s -> 1176.62s]  that. Thank you. What does it say? Oh, the teacher's ass is fucking huge. I wonder how he fits
[1177.26s -> 1183.26s]  at his desk. He probably desperately needs two seats for one for each, each ass cheek.
[1183.98s -> 1189.58s]  Fucking funny. Sit down. Every single one of you is coming after school for detention.
[1192.90s -> 1197.69s]  What, you didn't do anything? Doesn't matter. You all have to think about what you've done.
[1200.20s -> 1203.64s]  Unbelievable. Okay. So let's go to the windmill. Ready? Ready?
[1207.29s -> 1216.65s]  The windmill had five, um, whatever that is. That's all that was there. Sometimes it could
[1216.65s -> 1220.01s]  be something bad. Sometimes it could be a scenario. All right. Should I talk to the scholar?
[1221.38s -> 1225.30s]  As you ride into a clearing, you notice a university scholar resting his horse.
[1225.30s -> 1235.02s]  He agrees to teach you some of what he knows before setting off. Basic fire magic. I think
[1235.02s -> 1239.02s]  we just got easy mode right here. Basic. Can I learn that though? Okay. So what do I hold? Let me
[1239.02s -> 1246.81s]  see. Basic fire magic. Cast fire spells at a reduced cost. Ooh, but I don't know any spells
[1246.81s -> 1255.99s]  though. Where's my spell book? I don't think I have any, uh, spells. Where's the spell book? I know
[1255.99s -> 1265.90s]  it's like a certain button you press. I don't remember. I'll figure it out. Anyways. Okay.
[1265.90s -> 1273.80s]  Here's some wood. That was six wood. These don't respond by the way. There's seven, um, crystals.
[1274.52s -> 1279.67s]  Do you think I'm prepared to do this? What if I just lose? Uh, I'm, I'm out of time. I can't,
[1279.67s -> 1284.23s]  my turn is over. So as you can see, I can't go anywhere else. The only way it would be possible
[1284.23s -> 1288.15s]  for me to do anything else is if I had another hero, which you can recruit. They cost money.
[1288.95s -> 1296.14s]  By the way, that windmill sound is a, is somebody, is a page turning sound effect
[1296.14s -> 1302.01s]  that has been looped over and over again. Some, it's really pretty interesting. All right. So
[1302.81s -> 1305.29s]  uh, I can go to the kingdom. We can see the whole world. We don't really do much of that
[1305.29s -> 1313.40s]  right now. I can end my turn. That's all I can do. I'm done. End turn. Right. Ooh. Okay. It's our
[1313.40s -> 1319.58s]  turn again. Everybody else has moved. Everybody else has done something. Let's go to the shrine
[1319.58s -> 1334.63s]  of magic thought land mine. What does that mean? Land mine. I just exploded. I feel like I want
[1334.63s -> 1337.75s]  to try to fight this guy. Who do I have in mind? I got, I know I've got plenty of people. Let's
[1337.75s -> 1358.94s]  see if I can do it. Here we go. What? Why, why didn't I get to fight? What just happened? Um,
[1358.94s -> 1365.14s]  what, why did that happen? That's not supposed to happen. That's not, I'm okay. I'm telling you
[1365.14s -> 1371.30s]  that was absolutely not supposed to. I've auto combat on. Why would nine golems and 31 goblins
[1371.78s -> 1382.90s]  lose to six archers? Even in an auto scenario and Taurasara is dead. He's abandoned me. What?
[1387.67s -> 1398.82s]  Okay. What's, okay. It's it. I'm really confused in the, yeah. Okay. I need to, I need to let go
[1398.82s -> 1404.26s]  in the settings and turn that off. Okay. That's part of the HD mod. This is, I don't have the
[1404.26s -> 1411.69s]  HD mod. This is just from good old games. All right. But anyways, more importantly, um,
[1412.33s -> 1417.69s]  the hero with a higher tactic skill can arrange their armies before any combat begins. So before
[1417.69s -> 1423.83s]  combat begins, I can move, as you see, I've got these slots here. I'm going to try to get behind
[1423.83s -> 1428.95s]  this because that can give me line of sight. I don't have any ranged, so I'm kind of, I might
[1428.95s -> 1436.04s]  just be fucked anyways. Uh, we're just going to move forward and it's now my turn. They don't have
[1436.04s -> 1440.84s]  any active spells. Their, their morale is whatever. Fuck them. Damage three to five.
[1441.96s -> 1448.28s]  As long as I can, I might actually lose here. I actually might lose here. All right. That looks
[1448.28s -> 1457.02s]  fine. This is bad. This is going to be bad. I'm going to lose. I'm, I'm fucked. I just wanted to
[1457.02s -> 1468.18s]  show you what combat looked like. I might be able to do it. I might, it's possible. What about, do
[1468.18s -> 1482.30s]  I have any spells? Magic arrow. He can't, I can't do it. Yeah, I can. Here we go. All right. I killed
[1482.30s -> 1490.44s]  two of them. I'm going to go for it. They're going to kill these. This is bad. I'm going
[1491.24s -> 1502.44s]  right down to the bottom here. Come on. No, he's dead. I gotta do it again. The hero might be able
[1502.44s -> 1512.26s]  to do this. It's very possible. Come on. Here we go. All right. So once you get to this point
[1512.26s -> 1517.70s]  where I can actually get close enough to attack, you can get in there and choose any angles you
[1517.70s -> 1525.85s]  really want to from whatever hex you want to do. I'm going to do from here. Sometimes I have,
[1525.85s -> 1531.48s]  they can retaliate and when they retaliate, it does a certain amount of percentage of damage.
[1532.04s -> 1538.97s]  We're going to go right here. He's trying to run away. That's fine. We'll get under here.
[1540.17s -> 1549.21s]  These guys are stronger. Remember, let me slow this in. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Yeah. All
[1549.21s -> 1557.50s]  right. All right. Slow down the animations. It was going like really fast. Come on. Stay alive. I
[1557.50s -> 1567.61s]  don't want to use any spells. I have to. All right. Take them out and then get yourself over here.
[1570.10s -> 1583.19s]  He's alive. Very good. And that's a victory. A glorious victory for Valorant in combat.
[1583.19s -> 1589.45s]  Taurasar receives 250 experience. And here are your attackers and here's your defenders of 16
[1589.45s -> 1599.48s]  archers. We lost almost every single person. But did we? We're still all right. Remember,
[1600.04s -> 1607.88s]  every week you get more. They're back at the town. See? Ready? They're currently,
[1608.84s -> 1613.93s]  how do I get a good view of that? View towns. Okay. This is my only town that I have.
[1615.62s -> 1620.18s]  I think I actually have to physically go in here to see it. Don't I? I thought I,
[1620.18s -> 1628.15s]  can I just go look? Kingdom overview. Okay. See it here. Creatures available. So right.
[1628.15s -> 1636.04s]  It's, I can, I can go get 16 ramlins, but I need to get, okay, this is gold. Let's get it.
[1636.60s -> 1641.21s]  That was a thousand gold. Pretty cool. I don't know what this is. I'm kind of scared to click
[1641.21s -> 1646.90s]  it because I have, I have four, I have four golems and if there's like a monster in there,
[1646.90s -> 1655.78s]  I'm dead. There we go. Okay. So you don't have to be, your hero doesn't have to go in.
[1655.78s -> 1663.86s]  Here's our town. This is who's available to recruit. There's none here because they have,
[1663.86s -> 1671.26s]  it's by week. You can actually recruit all available creatures. Now let's see what we got.
[1671.26s -> 1675.51s]  Tavern. I can get another hero, but I don't think I want to do that because I'm,
[1675.51s -> 1682.07s]  I don't want to spread myself out. Arch Magi throw magic with a precision greater than most archers.
[1682.07s -> 1689.24s]  So we have a wizard and necromancer that are available to hire. You can get astral or nimbus
[1689.24s -> 1695.88s]  and that is a necromancer. Get the necromancer, but I'm not going to take the necromancer out.
[1695.88s -> 1703.11s]  I don't want to get too many heroes. That's 2,500 bucks. All right. Fine. We don't want to,
[1703.11s -> 1708.78s]  remember money is, money's important. I just bumped the mic. I know. So we have skeletons
[1708.78s -> 1716.39s]  and walking dead. That's what he starts with and we may as well. Um, just it's, that's a lot of
[1716.39s -> 1723.00s]  money, but recruit and we're going to, we're going to stack this guy. So he's got three, uh,
[1723.00s -> 1730.25s]  different creatures. I don't think any of these are ranged. And now as you see, here's the window.
[1730.25s -> 1735.14s]  I have two different options to where I want to go. I might just throw this guy away. Let's just go
[1735.14s -> 1746.23s]  and let's go in the portal. What I ended up over here. All right. Uh, this is somebody's kingdom.
[1746.23s -> 1753.64s]  This just took me right to the front door of somebody's house. Should I go in? Is there
[1753.64s -> 1758.52s]  anybody in there? There's nobody even here. There's like two frogs guarding this place.
[1758.52s -> 1768.31s]  I'm taking this one. I'm at, I'm out of turns. All right. There's like literally one frog here.
[1768.31s -> 1776.33s]  Let's go through here. I'm going to go this way with this guy because there's a pack of hobgoblins.
[1776.89s -> 1785.90s]  Let's get the ore. Let's get some gems. Another scenario where I can do, let's level them up.
[1787.40s -> 1791.40s]  Didn't level up. Okay. That's fine. Warrior's tomb, not visited. Go in there.
[1792.28s -> 1799.88s]  Okay. You have come upon the resting place of a nameless warrior. Do you wish to search the
[1799.88s -> 1811.24s]  tomb? Don't do it. Don't. Should I go in there? What if there's like gold in there? I don't have,
[1811.24s -> 1817.80s]  but my, I don't have my creatures. Like I, let's go for it. Reluctantly, your troops enter the
[1817.80s -> 1826.66s]  tomb, finding the vial of lifeblood, but such a despicable act has ruined your army's morale.
[1826.66s -> 1838.39s]  Oh damn. This item increases the health of all your units by plus two. Holy shit. That's pretty
[1838.39s -> 1847.03s]  great. Actually everyone has plus two health. So you mean, oh wait, 16 plus two. What do you mean?
[1847.03s -> 1850.55s]  No. So those of you that are still maybe a little confused, if you're not, then you know, that's
[1850.55s -> 1856.47s]  fine. But for the people that don't get it. So there are 16 gremlins in here. It looks like one
[1856.47s -> 1876.68s]  on the screen, but it's 16. So that means 16 times six instead of 16 times four. See six at 15 health
[1876.68s -> 1881.26s]  every, each, all of them. You know what I'm saying? Just want to just, just get you unaware
[1881.26s -> 1884.22s]  of what's happening. You know, just so you can see. All right. Well that was a good, that was
[1884.22s -> 1890.84s]  pretty good outcome. Let's get going. I'm out of time, I think. Let's end this turn. All right.
[1890.84s -> 1905.11s]  Do you think I can do this? Should I just, I, I don't think I can kill this one frog. Frog didn't
[1905.11s -> 1932.98s]  build. I gotta go in and turn that off. I don't want to see the outcome. So there's 13 frogs
[1935.38s -> 1941.85s]  and I've got, let's move forward a little bit here. This, yeah, cause this said this is going
[1941.85s -> 1946.09s]  to get launched. I have, remember the basic military, whatever basic ballistics. This is
[1946.09s -> 1954.17s]  why you have it. Because you want to take down walls. I wouldn't be able to do anything if I
[1954.17s -> 1957.37s]  didn't have this. Here come the frogs. They're coming out the front door. Why are you coming
[1957.37s -> 1970.49s]  out the front door? All right. Back it up. Cause he'll waste a turn. Okay. Can I just kill him?
[1977.03s -> 1981.74s]  All right. These things, these things are really weak. I'm probably just going to retaliate and
[1981.74s -> 1993.05s]  win. Uh, I don't think he can do anything. They just wait. Oh, fuck. He's good. He's
[1993.05s -> 2012.95s]  trying to kill it. Can he destroy that? Fucking frogs. 565 experience. Apply batteries out. Yes.
[2012.95s -> 2020.30s]  There we go. All right. Level three alchemist. Defense plus one. Everybody in the party gets
[2020.30s -> 2028.66s]  plus one. And then I can do basic archery or advanced tactics. Um, let's see. Basic archery
[2028.66s -> 2033.22s]  increases damage done by range attacking creatures by 10%. I don't have any, but it's
[2033.22s -> 2037.70s]  probably going to do to get it. Cause I'll probably eventually have some monsters of archery. And now
[2040.38s -> 2051.16s]  here we are. I can now recruit. Oh yeah. This is mine now. How much do these cost?
[2051.96s -> 2064.54s]  We've got a tavern town hall fort. I can level one ranger. No, no, not a one heroes right now.
[2066.58s -> 2072.06s]  Harpies. All right. How much is it to recruit all these? It's a lot of money, but I could deck
[2072.06s -> 2079.72s]  him out. Beholders. Are these ranged? What do you think Chuck? I'm just taking them. Let's do it.
[2080.44s -> 2093.78s]  Let's get off a nice little army here. I mean the frogs suck, but it's okay.
[2094.66s -> 2102.58s]  Get more frogmen. Uh, I have to wait till they, um, grow. All right. So I have Evernight and
[2102.58s -> 2107.80s]  Stronggale. Evernight is the other castle that I own. All right. We're going to hang out here.
[2108.52s -> 2113.46s]  Let's see. Should I buy something? What can I upgrade? Marketplace Citadel.
[2114.71s -> 2119.43s]  Including a 50% increase to base creature growth. The Citadel adds a keep and other terrain
[2119.43s -> 2125.29s]  obstacles in a town's defense. So I can increase the growth portal of summoning. You can recruit
[2125.29s -> 2135.90s]  creatures from an externally flogged flagged dwelling. Uh, blacksmith is, you can make the
[2135.90s -> 2142.47s]  list as mushroom rings. The mushroom rings increase Troglodyte production by seven per week.
[2143.03s -> 2147.19s]  I think we should do that. By the way, you can only do one, you can only build once per week.
[2147.99s -> 2154.06s]  So we're going to get some more frog recruits. I can no longer do anything here, but back here
[2154.06s -> 2157.10s]  I also, I don't want to bleed my money completely. That's the thing. You have to be careful.
[2159.72s -> 2164.82s]  Citadel. Uh, and just in case somebody comes, I'm going to get the Citadel. I'm going to build the
[2164.82s -> 2174.38s]  Citadel. More base creature growth. This is getting, ah, spells. I need spells. This is the spell
[2174.38s -> 2182.71s]  tower. And then in here, summon boat. Summons an existing friendly unoccupied boat from anywhere
[2182.71s -> 2190.41s]  in the world to your location. Chances for success at 50%. Dispel, magic arrow, slow. Okay. So I have
[2190.41s -> 2197.34s]  to bring somebody in here. I have my mage who's currently the necromancer. Does that count?
[2198.46s -> 2204.50s]  All right. Well, I'm, it's a new day. Spell points. Let's go, let's bring you in here.
[2204.50s -> 2212.36s]  Oh no, actually you're on the other side of the world. Sulfur. Uh, a little hut. Would you
[2212.36s -> 2223.98s]  like to recruit halflings? 15 halflings. Join your army. Nice place that they'd like to be.
[2223.98s -> 2232.89s]  Shrine of Magic. No longer have. Ooh, this crest is up there. Let me go. Did I go to this windmill?
[2232.89s -> 2243.67s]  Yeah, I did. Visited. Learn landmine. I wanted to go, what did I want to go, up or down? Um, let's go
[2244.15s -> 2251.06s]  up because this is mine here. So if you take a look at this, you see that this scattered stuff,
[2251.06s -> 2257.61s]  like the scattered ore all over the place, this is an actual like ore pit, which when you claim
[2257.61s -> 2263.85s]  these, you just, it will generate resources. So there's a pack of hobgoblins here. Who's in,
[2263.85s -> 2269.34s]  who's in this party enough? Oh, I want to, let me just disable this shit. How do I, um,
[2270.22s -> 2277.06s]  no, no, no, don't quit. Where's the menu? I just want to get rid of this quick,
[2277.06s -> 2286.14s]  get rid of quick combat. Okay. Yeah, there we go. Quick combat disabled. So save the game.
[2286.70s -> 2294.07s]  Oh yeah, that's right. You have to do manual saves. Save game. Auto save. Uh,
[2294.95s -> 2302.60s]  we're just going to name it first map. First map saved successfully. Here we go.
[2304.46s -> 2310.79s]  Pack of hobgoblins. Here we go. They want to fight. They can move a lot. They can move very
[2310.79s -> 2315.51s]  long way. Eight. This is like, I got enough. Unfortunately, I'm, I don't know if I'm going
[2315.51s -> 2320.47s]  to be able to, let me see my spells. Shield. Shield's a selected unit reducing the amount
[2320.47s -> 2324.31s]  of damage received from hand to hand attacks. I think I'm going to do that to you because
[2324.31s -> 2331.93s]  that's where they're going. And I mean, you're not going to be able to move anywhere. He's going to
[2331.93s -> 2337.86s]  make it. So might as well just move forward. Uh, you on the other hand, you're going to be,
[2337.86s -> 2342.10s]  was he going to cleaver? Oh fuck. I thought I was controlling him. I'm an idiot. No, I'm not.
[2342.10s -> 2363.69s]  That's fine. No, he's going for you. Bad. Okay, go in there. Oh, you had nothing. What did he just
[2363.69s -> 2376.01s]  do? Shield. Luck. What did he just do? Oh, these guys, they kind of suck. Skeletons are good.
[2376.89s -> 2385.38s]  Okay, we're good. That was low morale. Okay, right, right, right. We lost five little gremlins. It's
[2385.38s -> 2393.19s]  all right. 75 experience and they could just access to this ore pit. Two every day. Forever,
[2393.19s -> 2396.31s]  unless somebody else claims this. So there's nothing else up here. Wait, artifact.
[2399.40s -> 2410.55s]  Stoic Watchman. What's that? What's a stoic watchman? This figure increases your eagle eye
[2410.55s -> 2419.66s]  skill by 10%. I don't even know what that is. That's hidden back here. All right, so that's all
[2419.66s -> 2424.94s]  back here. I have no more things to do. I mean, I guess it could. I only have 50. What do I have? 5600?
[2428.62s -> 2443.05s]  5600. No, we just got to end the turns. All right, day four. So I have learned summoned boat.
[2443.93s -> 2446.95s]  Although I don't really know for what reason that is.
[2447.91s -> 2455.30s]  Kind of went this way, but I want to get the treasure. Um, I'll take the money this time.
[2456.02s -> 2469.50s]  Oh, shit. A pack of Gorgons. I don't think I'll be able to beat that. Yeah, I'm not going to chance
[2469.50s -> 2476.86s]  that one. So Seer's Hut. In order to travel through these dangerous lands, my envoy needs
[2476.86s -> 2482.94s]  more backup. I hear 60 halflings and 12 trolls are excellent guards. If you were to bring them to me,
[2482.94s -> 2497.50s]  I would be deeply grateful. Huh. Well, I have, I have a few of them. I don't have a whole lot.
[2497.50s -> 2506.87s]  I need 60 halflings and 12 trolls. Uh, rally flag. That's out of turn. Let's go back to the
[2506.87s -> 2515.77s]  worlds here. All right. So I got 8600. Level two, Citadel Marketplace. You can buy and sell
[2515.77s -> 2522.20s]  resources. You exchange things back and forth. That's pretty good. Uh, lookout tower extends
[2522.20s -> 2526.36s]  a visible distance around your city. That's pretty good too. Uh, allows you to recruit
[2526.36s -> 2533.22s]  stone gargoyles. I feel like I'd want this upgraded workshop. Uh, master gremlins are available.
[2536.26s -> 2547.27s]  Wall of Knowledge increases any hero's knowledge by plus one if they visit. Uh, I'm going to go
[2547.27s -> 2553.99s]  with this. I'm going to go with the Citadel. It's, I mean, you need to have like walls,
[2553.99s -> 2565.10s]  so they can just walk right in. What's the library? More spells. Yeah. Let's, uh, what do
[2565.10s -> 2569.42s]  I need for the city hall? City hall allows you to purchase town structures and earns your kingdom
[2569.42s -> 2574.71s]  2000 gold per day. I need a marketplace and a blacksmith. I probably should just get the
[2574.71s -> 2581.88s]  marketplace. Yeah. Let's just, let's just start that process. So as you see here, I can, you know,
[2581.88s -> 2588.57s]  for instance, um, I think this changes week to week depending on certain outcomes and certain
[2588.57s -> 2593.78s]  seasons. Some things can be worth more money. So here's the resources available to trade. So I can
[2593.78s -> 2602.02s]  do, you know, I could trade gems for gold. I can trade, you know, crystals for wood and the ratio
[2602.02s -> 2609.27s]  as you see is not very good, but yeah, it's pretty cool. It's pretty cool. So that exists now. Let's
[2609.27s -> 2621.05s]  go to the other one. Anything, nobody to recruit. What can I do here? I need to, hmm, 5000. I don't
[2621.05s -> 2626.98s]  think I have, I don't really have enough to do this. The Academy of Battle Scholars teaches new
[2626.98s -> 2638.22s]  skills to any hero once. Pillar of Eyes. The Pillar of Eyes allows you to recruit evil eyes.
[2638.94s -> 2649.26s]  What is this? You can recruit Medusas with this one. Yeah, this will 2000. I'll get 4,000 per day.
[2652.10s -> 2658.17s]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to just get two city halls. Let's just go to the marketplace.
[2664.10s -> 2671.35s]  Starting to run out of resources here though. All right, let's go. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh no.
[2671.99s -> 2676.12s]  Okay, this, he's come, that's my house. He's got, he, this is, this is another player.
[2678.49s -> 2681.85s]  Uh, he's, he's gonna take me over. He's trying to take, what, what does he have?
[2684.25s -> 2698.04s]  I have, pretty decent, what does he have? Several, a horde of skeletons. Uh, what is his stuff?
[2698.04s -> 2704.23s]  I can't, I don't know. Destroy him? Kill him. He's got a horde of skeletons. This is probably
[2704.23s -> 2718.17s]  gonna be bad. All right, I'm going for it. No, I'm not. He's gonna take the castle. I'm not prepared
[2718.17s -> 2737.30s]  for him. I'm just gonna, yeah, I'm gonna go in. Everybody to the battle stations. Wait, I can't,
[2737.30s -> 2759.99s]  can I not place him up here? There we go. Okay. Um, can I recruit anybody? Is anybody available?
[2759.99s -> 2773.98s]  There's nobody available. Uh, should I make something and recruit someone? I don't do,
[2773.98s -> 2783.93s]  I don't have enough. 2010 and five. I don't have enough money. No, I don't have enough of,
[2783.93s -> 2800.04s]  what is it, ore? What am I missing? Wood. Fuck. I need to build the citadel. Quick. Okay, yeah,
[2800.04s -> 2809.21s]  I need, I need to add terrain obstacles. Pull up the bridge. Let's go. Wait, hold on. I'm gonna
[2809.21s -> 2816.15s]  send reinforcements. Uh, hold on. Blacksmith. I don't know what, I need wood. I gotta go fucking
[2816.15s -> 2825.35s]  find wood. How do I need to make wood? Plus one gem every day. I need wood. I need goddamn wood.
[2825.99s -> 2834.70s]  But the exchange rate's probably so bad. Let's go to the market. Okay, wood. I need wood.
[2835.66s -> 2844.15s]  And I'm gonna give money. I just like fucking almost restarted my computer, I think,
[2844.15s -> 2855.14s]  because I just elbowed my, this is so stupid. Supply and demand. Bullshit. Look at that. What
[2855.14s -> 2877.26s]  about hay? No, these are all such bad exchange rates. God damn it. No, nothing I can do. No.
[2877.90s -> 2890.95s]  How many, how much wood do I have? I need four, right? Uh, trade the M&Ms. No, no, I'll be fine.
[2890.95s -> 2894.79s]  I'll be fine. I'm not gonna, I have good troops here. I've got good people here.
[2895.35s -> 2906.39s]  I've got, they're garrisoned up and they're ready to go behind walls. Let's just do it. You're out
[2906.39s -> 2914.90s]  here. Rally the, rally the troops. I got some luck. I got some morale. Wood. How much is it?
[2916.07s -> 2925.59s]  Eight wood. Oh yeah, eight wood. And I got some spell, I got eight spell points. Done. We don't
[2925.59s -> 2931.48s]  have to end there. Learning stone. Mercury. All right, don't, don't do anything crazy here. Just
[2931.48s -> 2938.34s]  get more mercury. I can't, there's an alchemist's lab. What's this thing? Learning stone. Nimbus is
[2938.34s -> 2948.01s]  now a level two necromancer. Advanced necromancy or basic wisdom allows 20% of the creatures killed
[2948.01s -> 2954.81s]  in combat to be brought back from the dead as skeletons. Basic wisdom allows your hero to learn
[2954.97s -> 2966.23s]  third level spells. I mean, yeah. Now we're a real necromancer. I don't have much more wiggle room
[2966.23s -> 2982.79s]  here. All right, I need to be ready. So let's go back here. Um, I got, I take the wood. What was
[2982.79s -> 2990.02s]  I gonna build with this wood? Blacksmith. Cause then I can do city hall. Yeah. Blacksmith and then
[2990.02s -> 3001.06s]  city hall. This is five wood and this is 5,000. Ammo carts. There it is. Blacksmith. Only visiting
[3001.06s -> 3008.23s]  heroes may use the blacksmith and then next week I can do a city hall. Cause I already built
[3008.23s -> 3013.43s]  something here. It's just at the front fucking door. God damn it. All right. I'm ready. Ready?
[3014.65s -> 3024.17s]  Three, two, one. He backed off. He took all my fucking shit though. He took, I was going to get
[3024.17s -> 3034.89s]  all this stuff, which that was my stuff. We just ran away for no reason. I just like panicked,
[3034.89s -> 3056.73s]  but nothing. Kill him? He's got, how much is a horde? 50 to a hundred? It's a lot. He's
[3056.73s -> 3066.12s]  unsuspecting. Got him. I, seven. I told you it was like a hundred. I told you it was a hundred.
[3070.52s -> 3078.97s]  All right. What is he? Harpy. Harpies can probably move real fast. All right. I got to play this
[3078.97s -> 3114.07s]  smart. The hobbits. I think can you cast like spells? They can't go through the rocks. I'm
[3114.07s -> 3120.63s]  terrified of this person. Protect the frog at all costs. Now this is okay. This would be fine.
[3122.31s -> 3141.61s]  All right. You ready? I'm ready. Let's get a spell out here. I got magic arrow on, on the whites
[3142.25s -> 3149.77s]  or on the skeletons. It has to be 59. It does 10 every time. I'm staying where I am. Defend.
[3153.91s -> 3161.26s]  It's not great range, but it's enough. That's bad. Oh fuck. Okay. Hold on. Oh, the hobbits are
[3161.26s -> 3172.46s]  ranged. I don't have any, I can't do any of those spells. Who's priority right now?
[3175.96s -> 3190.15s]  Probably the whites. Look at the damage. Not bad. All right. Should I, should I just throw like these
[3190.15s -> 3197.80s]  fucking green onions up here? Should I just make the green onions go forward first?
[3202.89s -> 3215.99s]  Okay. Here we go. Oh God. That hurts. That hurts. No, not a good opportunity. They have good attack,
[3215.99s -> 3230.70s]  but I don't want to just throw them up there. They'll get hurt. Stay here. Defend. Spell. Defend.
[3230.70s -> 3240.26s]  Good opportunity here. Good. Oh, oh no. They're getting closer. They're getting closer. Um,
[3241.53s -> 3251.19s]  it's all right. The green onions are dead. Four. Oh, it's getting close. Here we go.
[3252.23s -> 3259.16s]  Should I go for the whites or should I go for the skeletons? I think I got to go for the whites,
[3259.64s -> 3269.26s]  but there's so many more skeletons though. Get in there. Oh, oh no. He's creeping up.
[3269.26s -> 3278.79s]  Come on. Let's go naked guy. I'm thinking Harpy's defense. Damage one to four.
[3279.75s -> 3293.51s]  Damage one to three. I got to whittle down the skeletons. They're 28. I'm going for the whites.
[3301.08s -> 3305.56s]  That's a great power to have. Come on. I'm going to try. Maybe I should back you up.
[3309.24s -> 3317.50s]  I think I'm going to go back. Yes! All right. Move the hobbits. They need to stay alive.
[3321.74s -> 3327.34s]  Uh, we're going to have, okay, we're going to have to have naked guy versus half naked guy.
[3328.14s -> 3348.30s]  Ah, they do a lot of damage. All right. Here we go. Should I? I think, I think it's time to
[3348.30s -> 3356.70s]  sacrifice you. I'm going to fly down here. I don't have any spell points. I'm out of mana.
[3358.14s -> 3382.65s]  Out of mana. 24. 20. I can't really run. Just, uh oh. Keep fighting over here. He's a pretty good
[3382.65s -> 3396.79s]  tank. Okay. Here we go. Ready? 10 skeletons left. Eight. Four. Yes! This is a victory here. This is
[3396.79s -> 3411.86s]  a good victory. Um, I can't go that far. Let's get it closer so I can do it next time. The enemy,
[3411.86s -> 3429.86s]  no, the enemy's fled. He ran away with one guy. Okay. Where did he, where did he flee? No, he's
[3429.86s -> 3442.31s]  dead. He literally disintegrated. Yeah, he's dead. He's gone. He abandoned the cause. Okay,
[3442.31s -> 3450.46s]  because I didn't kill him. I win. Good fight. Good victory. You all deserve a raise. Spell scroll.
[3451.48s -> 3454.92s]  Just as you bend to pick up the old parchment, you hear something move behind you.
[3455.86s -> 3459.78s]  Turning around, you notice some marksmen in the trees. You are not really sure why,
[3459.78s -> 3462.50s]  but you get the feeling that if you pick up the parchment, they will attack.
[3463.83s -> 3472.49s]  Do you want to pick up the parchment? I don't, not after fighting all that. I don't have enough,
[3473.13s -> 3494.92s]  it'll still be there. No, it'll be there. I, I, I, uh, we're gonna, I, no. What do we got over here?
[3494.92s -> 3500.68s]  So we've got this already. A pack of stone goblins. I got a pretty decent crew, right?
[3507.98s -> 3516.30s]  Damage four to five. Damage three. Damage two to three. These guys are slow and they can't move
[3516.30s -> 3537.90s]  very far. Shield everybody up. Well, not yet. Hold on. None of them are ranged. I mean,
[3537.90s -> 3551.70s]  this thing actually is pretty strong. Should I run? The cowardly Nimbus flees from battle.
[3553.59s -> 3558.12s]  What? Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Wait a minute. Is he dead?
[3561.50s -> 3602.86s]  Where is he? I, I didn't know that's what happened. It's been a while. I didn't know
[3602.86s -> 3610.33s]  that when you retreat, they just delete themselves. Okay, so I'm not going to fight you. A pack of
[3610.33s -> 3617.61s]  gogs. I don't know if I can do that either. Would you like to recruit gremlins? 16 gremlins join
[3617.61s -> 3623.75s]  your army. Nice. And there's a chest here. After scouring the area, you fall upon a hidden chest
[3623.75s -> 3630.68s]  containing the ancient artifact Mystic Orb of Mana. What is that? This orb helps you recover
[3630.68s -> 3642.90s]  three extra spell points per day. Nice. Pretty nice. Although I can't get this stuff, unfortunately.
[3643.46s -> 3654.10s]  I kind of need to just go down to the other. I'm too, I'm too weak to do any of that. All right,
[3654.10s -> 3664.57s]  we got it. I think I can do citadels, right? In City Hall. 2,000 extra gold per day. Do it.
[3664.57s -> 3680.30s]  5,000. Bingo. Our growth has increased. The capital building is the new one. Pretty nice,
[3680.30s -> 3688.78s]  although I'm out of resources though. This can also be done. No, I need a blacksmith. I don't
[3688.78s -> 3706.78s]  have enough wood, but I think I'm just going to trade for it with one of my like pots because I
[3706.78s -> 3717.53s]  want to be able to do this stuff next week. Blacksmith. I need to deck this place out.
[3720.15s -> 3727.35s]  New turn. Weirdly enough, I've only seen that one person. Aren't there like four or five people
[3727.35s -> 3738.17s]  on this map? 60 halflings in there. I'm just gonna head down here. I'm gonna have to use
[3738.17s -> 3744.97s]  that whole day to do this though. All right, almost done with the first week almost.
[3745.69s -> 3753.43s]  Which brings us to here. I don't think I can get over here. There's just that.
[3753.43s -> 3759.43s]  Red Keymaster's tent is being guarded by a pack of Gorgons. They're probably really strong though.
[3764.14s -> 3770.22s]  PvP versus viewers. I don't have the new version. This is the old GOG version. There's no
[3770.22s -> 3777.62s]  multiplayer. It's unfortunate because the new version is kind of all fucked up and
[3777.62s -> 3782.34s]  messed up in a lot of places. The new, the old version is way better, but doesn't have
[3782.98s -> 3789.37s]  like multiplayer capabilities. But wait, the good old, the GOG one does it. Isn't it like land?
[3793.64s -> 3804.58s]  Sea Chest. Where's my spell book? Should I get in the boat? No, no, no, I need it. Okay,
[3804.58s -> 3811.22s]  we're almost done with the first week. I can recruit some people. Well, yeah, not, not yet,
[3811.22s -> 3815.66s]  not yet. That's a pretty good idea, but hold on. I, I don't have any money for anything.
[3816.30s -> 3824.84s]  I could do the Citadel here. Resource silo. Citadel. I'm just gonna run out of money.
[3826.84s -> 3842.39s]  I probably should Citadel this. Stone. No, give me this. Nine per week. I'll get eight. I'll get
[3842.39s -> 3854.47s]  more. Four thousand gold. Looks all right. Okay, let's go over here. Portal of Summoning. I don't
[3854.47s -> 3860.71s]  know what that means. The Harpy Loft allows you to recruit Harpy Hags. So what do I have? I have
[3860.71s -> 3865.19s]  these, uh, these Harpies, regular Harpies. I can upgrade the Harpies and then we get new, better
[3865.19s -> 3876.36s]  ones next week. I'm going for it. There they are. Harpy Hags and regular Harpies. Two different
[3876.36s -> 3889.85s]  versions. Damage one to four. Attack six six, six five. And these are much faster. Strike and return
[3889.85s -> 3894.94s]  and no enemy retaliation on the upgraded ones. That's pretty good. All right, we'll see it next
[3894.94s -> 3907.43s]  week. First week is about to be complete. I don't have anything else I can do. Astrologers proclaim
[3907.43s -> 3914.17s]  week of the Condor. All dwellings increase population. All right, let's take a look at what
[3914.17s -> 3924.36s]  that does. Nice. So we've got a lot of options here. I've got 6,000 gold. Should I just pull
[3924.36s -> 3938.17s]  everybody? 3750 for 18 Gargoyles, 17 Comedy Gremlins, and six Naked Guys. I think that's
[3938.17s -> 3954.06s]  pretty good. Recruit them all. You guys can stay there for now. Let's go over here. Let's recruit
[3954.06s -> 3967.24s]  all here. I don't fucking have any money. I need to, oh shit. I need to, okay, I gotta go.
[3968.50s -> 3991.94s]  Let's fill, fill that up. Come here. Ah, damn it. I, ah. No, it's gotta, this is a pretty decent team
[3991.94s -> 4010.25s]  so far. 44, nine, 18, six and six. These guys are strong. These guys are strong. So now, shouldn't,
[4010.25s -> 4020.60s]  can I do this? Uh, I have to spend, yeah, I might as well just do it. So now I have better Harpies
[4020.60s -> 4027.42s]  here. No, just, you sit around for a minute until I get a little bit more money. Because I'm gonna
[4027.42s -> 4035.00s]  have you go into the ocean. You've got enough troops where you're, of course, to be reckoned
[4035.00s -> 4044.18s]  with here. We got, uh, Witch Hut. This will have to be next week. I don't have any money to do
[4044.18s -> 4052.38s]  anything so let's keep going. What? It didn't take too long for you to realize that people will not
[4052.38s -> 4057.98s]  bow down to a new god as easily as you might like. Fine. You tell yourself, if it's a war they want,
[4057.98s -> 4065.42s]  it's a war they're going to get. Who did I say that to? Witch's Hut.
[4066.81s -> 4070.49s]  An ancient witch living in a strange hut welcomes you, teaching you offense for her own
[4070.49s -> 4079.94s]  indestructible purposes. I learned basic offense. Thanks. Increases all hand-to-hand damage
[4079.94s -> 4095.86s]  inflicted by the hero's troops by 10 percent. In, what did I say? No Marauders. You really need to
[4095.86s -> 4108.17s]  get these. I got a lot of troops. 20 spell points. I think I can take them. The no more
[4108.17s -> 4113.53s]  marauders awed by the power of your forces begin to scatter. Do you wish to pursue and engage them?
[4113.53s -> 4127.72s]  Let them run. In awe at the, of in awe at the absolute size of this unit. Two wood a day. That's
[4127.72s -> 4144.25s]  good. I need it. Money or Mr. Experience. Nice. Level three. Expert Necromancy or buyer magic.
[4145.05s -> 4148.33s]  Expert Necromancy allows 30 percent of the creatures killed in combat to be brought back
[4148.33s -> 4153.75s]  from the dead as skeletons. I mean this, why would I do anything else at this point?
[4153.75s -> 4164.97s]  This is the like the Resurrector. Okay cool. I don't think I want to do anything else. I want
[4164.97s -> 4173.88s]  to do a boat with you. How much money do I have now? All right I can do this. I don't, I want to
[4173.88s -> 4189.45s]  do upgraded tags. So if I pull everybody, these hags? Yes they are. Okay. Recruit them. Get them all.
[4191.93s -> 4198.44s]  All right. Wait before it snow. I don't have any more money but I want to summon the boat over here.
[4199.40s -> 4217.50s]  How do I summon the boat? Where's my spell book? That's one thing I do. There it is. Cast a spell.
[4217.50s -> 4225.03s]  Summon boat. That spell costs eight spell points. We have six. God damn it. I only have six points?
[4229.03s -> 4232.95s]  Well you can just, you hang out here and just take care of the castle for a while.
[4239.22s -> 4246.50s]  Next day. What do I have for, all right so we're going down this way. Hutter the Magi.
[4247.14s -> 4251.54s]  You enter a rickety hut and talk to the magician who lives there. He tells you a place near and
[4251.54s -> 4264.17s]  far which may aid you in your journey. Oh shit. Oh shit. Look at that. Look at these things. Bears.
[4264.49s -> 4271.40s]  The coliseum. He's just revealing everything for us. Look at this dude. Holy fuck. Thanks man. All
[4271.40s -> 4287.05s]  right so let's see. Where am I now? I am right here. So if we go down there is, we got a shipyard.
[4287.69s -> 4295.94s]  A lot of stuff. There's some wraiths. There's a gem factory. Golem factory. Subterranean rocks.
[4295.94s -> 4304.68s]  There's a little ship out here. There's the eye. Let's just go down here first. Actually this is
[4304.68s -> 4314.23s]  like the top. Let me see. There's another castle over here. Let me just see what it is. What is
[4314.23s -> 4323.90s]  this? University. Your hero's footsteps echo through the quiet halls of this ancient university.
[4325.00s -> 4330.52s]  A clerk informs you that while here your hero may receive instruction on the following subjects.
[4331.48s -> 4340.09s]  Offense. Logistics. Learning. First aid. You cannot learn first aid. This will cost 2,000 gold.
[4340.09s -> 4344.97s]  Basic logistics. Increase your hero's movement points over land so you get to move 10% more
[4344.97s -> 4362.55s]  each turn. Or basic learning. 5% more experience. But it's also all my money. 10% more movement per
[4362.55s -> 4377.54s]  turn or 5% more overall experience. Tuition for learning basic logistics is 2,000 gold. Let's do
[4377.62s -> 4392.73s]  it. Hey, um, why don't I just do them both? No, not free. Should I do them both? Oh, I can't. Right,
[4392.73s -> 4397.93s]  okay. I thought it was already in real time updating that. Well, okay, I can move more.
[4398.57s -> 4412.49s]  I couldn't really build anything in 1,000 gold. How many spell points do I have? What do you have
[4412.49s -> 4420.92s]  for spell points? Eight. All right, let's go. It's time. Cast the boat. We're getting that chest in
[4420.92s -> 4443.99s]  the middle of the ocean. Boat. What? Oh, it's a 50% chance. Well, go back to bed. Get some sleep.
[4445.70s -> 4460.41s]  We'll try again tomorrow. Uh-oh. That guy just killed somebody. Where's that person? I think
[4460.41s -> 4467.16s]  they're on a different continent. All right, things are getting interesting. Take a nap and
[4467.16s -> 4475.48s]  go again. All right, so there we go. We got War Machine Factory. Oh, damn. Recruit Ballistas.
[4477.19s -> 4492.50s]  Ah, they're so expensive, but they're so powerful. Give me one. Can I not do it? No, I can do it.
[4492.50s -> 4512.58s]  Look at this shit. I want like a ton of these. Worth it. I'm taking the money. Den of Thieves,
[4512.58s -> 4521.02s]  or do I go up to the Harpy Hags? Look at that. A pack of Silver Pegasi. Protecting a gold mine.
[4521.98s -> 4531.96s]  Let's go this way. Den of Thieves. Oh, this just tells you about...
[4540.12s -> 4552.97s]  So here we go. Number of towns. Oh, shit. Artifacts. Kingdom. Army. Income.
[4553.93s -> 4568.25s]  So I'm the green flag, right? Best hero. Personality. Human. What is that? Is that a goat?
[4569.13s -> 4574.25s]  Best monster is my Beholders. This is cool, though, because it can show you just how...
[4575.21s -> 4584.49s]  That's interesting. All right, so we know how to be careful. A pack of mummies.
[4585.29s -> 4596.41s]  And a sulfur. There's a Coliseum here. Arena. Thousand experience. I'll take it. Thanks for
[4596.41s -> 4607.85s]  1000 HP. That's all we can do for now. All right, how's the other guy doing? Two spell points. It's
[4607.85s -> 4614.42s]  not... You know what? Fuck it. We got places to be. Just... I want that sea chest. So bad.
[4617.06s -> 4626.62s]  Ugh. Somebody right here. No, it's me. Go for the cow. I don't know if I can do it. Oh no,
[4626.62s -> 4632.09s]  I can go for the... I'll go for the scroll. Okay, here we go. I've got a decent army here. I've got,
[4632.09s -> 4636.87s]  like, pretty good hags. You get the feeling that if you pick up this parchment, they're going to
[4636.87s -> 4662.47s]  attack. Oh my god. What have I done? Uh, this is impossible. I won't be this... Must be something
[4662.47s -> 4695.99s]  pretty good, yeah. Um... Retreat, but... But I'm gonna lose everybody anyways. Everybody hide.
[4695.99s -> 4705.06s]  These guys are magicians. They're gonna fucking kill everybody. No, I'm not setting the frogs
[4705.06s -> 4723.34s]  out. I'm gonna see if this is even doable. I don't have any fucking spell points. Uh...
[4724.78s -> 4731.51s]  This is... That's a... Guys, these guys have crossbows. This guy's dead. Dude, he just is.
[4732.68s -> 4741.22s]  And I could retreat and then redo, but it's over. Might as well try to take as many out as I can.
[4745.22s -> 4757.00s]  I'm gonna stay back here though. Oh, this is bad. Very bad. I didn't even kill one of them.
[4757.00s -> 4782.41s]  Pop its attention. Send out the frogs. No, I like these guys. At least... Let's try to take a piece
[4782.41s -> 4822.02s]  off before we go down. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No rewind. I'm not gonna save, scum. That was an
[4822.02s -> 4828.66s]  outcome that... I went for the item. I went for the spell scroll and it was like, hey, be careful.
[4829.62s -> 4837.40s]  And I got fucking wrecked. That's just the way it is. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. This is
[4837.40s -> 4842.78s]  the guy. This is the guy that's level like three. He knows what he's doing. He's got a great military
[4842.78s -> 4847.62s]  here of undead creatures. He's got more spell points. This guy's way better. All right, I'll
[4847.62s -> 4856.30s]  get a new one. We'll get a better hero. For instance. Like, take a look. Ready? Uh, where's
[4856.30s -> 4868.87s]  the tavern? Yeah, I mean, already I like these two more. This is a death knight. Or should we get
[4868.87s -> 4887.05s]  this guy? Thane or Volkiel? I'm going with Thane. All right. Alchemist. Wait, don't we already have
[4887.05s -> 4899.90s]  an alchemist? We know we did. Thane. I mean, I kind of need Thane. But death knight is like...
[4899.90s -> 4906.31s]  Let's just wait. Let's compare them. So death knight starts with... Okay, hold on. So death
[4906.31s -> 4913.69s]  knight starts with the skeletons and the the wraiths. This is necromancy and artillery.
[4913.69s -> 4921.91s]  Specializes in vampires. Okay. This is gargoyles and gremlins. Is an advanced scholar. Has a bunch
[4921.91s -> 4930.63s]  of points and specializes in genies. Hmm. This is a scholar. We have a necromancer already.
[4931.19s -> 4950.86s]  I'm going to go with the genie. You hang out there for a while. You're gonna have two? Yeah,
[4951.10s -> 4954.38s]  I know. I just want to spread it out a little bit. Don't bite off more than I can chew.
[4955.26s -> 4961.62s]  They're starting... We're starting to get to the stage where people are starting to move around.
[4961.62s -> 4974.60s]  Oh! No! They have a terrible... They have a shit army though. This army sucks. This army sucks.
[4975.24s -> 4984.84s]  What do I kill first? These guys are terrible. I can't even attack the skeletons.
[4989.70s -> 5000.98s]  I can't... I can't go that far. Okay. Skeletons. You're not going to get in here. This is an
[5000.98s -> 5004.18s]  impenetrable fort. You're not getting in. I'll kill you all before you get in here.
[5004.90s -> 5019.00s]  Good thing we took the magician. Oh boy, they can... They can fucking throw in here. Oh fuck.
[5022.95s -> 5042.47s]  Oh no, they can get in here. Oh, eat shit. We're fine. Everything's fine. Yes! Just stay behind
[5042.47s -> 5060.90s]  the walls. Ow! All right, get in there and then get out. Whoa! What? Wait, what happened? Why did
[5060.90s -> 5074.65s]  he die? He landed in the pit. That's not fair. He got boiled in the oil.
[5088.68s -> 5103.02s]  Shit. I just bought you. You would take 2,500 gold. Do not apply... I have to... I can't just
[5103.10s -> 5116.95s]  redo every battle. You can't just redo every single time. It was dumb. Yeah, but now I learned.
[5116.95s -> 5122.76s]  Don't worry. I'll get it back. Guys, don't worry. I'll get it back. That was a dumb mistake.
[5124.89s -> 5134.41s]  Rewind? Was it dumb? Is that a fucking mistake?
[5138.55s -> 5141.99s]  All right, let's go. All right, it's the only time I'm going to rewind in the whole day.
[5142.55s -> 5159.27s]  I promise. Just don't land in boiling oil. All right, kill this motherfucker. All right,
[5159.27s -> 5170.82s]  everyone can just defend. Defend, defend. Take him out. I've got my Medusa archers.
[5171.54s -> 5186.12s]  Do not let him in here. All right, everybody defend. I'm gonna lose the gremlins. Are you
[5186.12s -> 5202.55s]  gonna burn in the oil? You can't get in here, can you? I'm not doing that. Ow. Oh fuck. They
[5202.55s -> 5217.88s]  have to die now. Yes. Thane received 722 experience. We have pushed them back. The
[5217.88s -> 5230.33s]  person is collecting all my stuff. That person is taking all the things that I want. A pack of
[5230.33s -> 5249.21s]  mummies. Add some sulfur. Mine. Save the game. Okay. I wonder if a pack of mummies will be able
[5249.21s -> 5258.70s]  to take me on. This is a pretty good crew here. I mean, like, really? What do they got? Nothing.
[5259.66s -> 5266.39s]  I think they're ranged, though. No, they're not ranged. All right. Good to know.
[5267.43s -> 5274.81s]  Move the gremlins forward. I don't think I need to cast any spells here.
[5275.77s -> 5287.18s]  They have Curse. I forget what Curse does. I'll have a homeless second here. Stone skin,
[5287.18s -> 5298.73s]  shield, magic arrow. Just lame it out in the corner. Let's try magic arrow on you. Holy shit.
[5299.45s -> 5320.20s]  Okay. These guys are pretty tough. Skeletons, move in. Butchers. Butchers, move in. Naked guys,
[5320.20s -> 5331.19s]  move in. I wanted more of these. All right, here we go. I'm gonna get a little bounce back here.
[5332.15s -> 5347.10s]  Get it. Oof. It's all right. We're doing fine. Right in front of you. In fact, stone skin,
[5348.06s -> 5358.42s]  defense, shield. Hmm. Which one's better? They both do the same kind of thing, right? Dispel.
[5361.38s -> 5383.05s]  Slow. We'll do stone skin. Yeah, we're fine. Move in. We got three more. Uh-oh.
[5383.93s -> 5394.25s]  Cursed? Yeah, he's cursed. Oh, they're both cursed. What does the curse do, though? Cursed duration
[5394.25s -> 5401.43s]  three rounds. Spells affecting the army. What does it do? I think we'll be fine. It's one down.
[5402.15s -> 5415.64s]  Skeletons coming up from the back. And butchers coming up from the left. Okay, we're good. Level
[5415.64s -> 5426.02s]  four. Advanced eagle eye or water magic. Spell power plus one. Advanced eagle eye gives your
[5426.02s -> 5434.34s]  hero a 50% chance to learn any spell up to third level used in combat. Or allows your hero to cast
[5434.34s -> 5443.38s]  water spells at a reduced cost. 50% chance to learn any spell up to third level. What does that mean?
[5446.33s -> 5454.73s]  I mean, maybe we should just try it. All right, one soul for a day is not going to come from here.
[5455.29s -> 5470.30s]  Let me see. What does that, what does that do? Spell. It's just all learn from the enemy here.
[5470.30s -> 5475.64s]  Okay, I see. That's interesting. That's pretty cool. All right, what do I want to do now?
[5476.60s -> 5490.14s]  I have this. Let's see. 35, 33, 15, 6, 6. Pack of wood elves. I don't have any range, though.
[5491.10s -> 5497.56s]  I think I'm going to avoid them for now. Yeah, I'll avoid them for now. Let's get the chest.
[5498.28s -> 5505.70s]  Experience. Level up. That's all right. Get the crystals. Idle of fortune.
[5506.42s -> 5512.71s]  It's awesome. I can't, I don't think I can go here unless these are dead. Is Stain still alive?
[5512.71s -> 5518.86s]  Yes. All right, Thane. Just hang out there for now. I'm going to recruit the frogs.
[5519.66s -> 5534.86s]  Okay, I don't think I can do much. Nobody to recruit. Go on. That guy's in a boat.
[5534.86s -> 5550.31s]  Where they're getting a lot of stuff done on their turns. Pack of nomads. I'm so timid. Idle
[5550.31s -> 5556.18s]  of fortune. You found an ancient and weathered stone. Idle. Kissing it is supposed to bring
[5556.18s -> 5567.50s]  luck or happiness. So you do. This stone is very cold. Got more morale. Gems. Silver wing tower.
[5567.50s -> 5583.35s]  There's nobody here. Shit's fucking empty. I'll take it. It's empty. All right, let's
[5583.35s -> 5596.90s]  gonna relax here. And you got gremlins. I'll take them. I got 59 gremlins. This is an actual
[5596.90s -> 5606.01s]  empty town though. I already have a fort. 2000 gold per day. I could have just a huge income.
[5609.14s -> 5618.87s]  Marketplace. Go for it. Get a marketplace up here. Hang out in there for now. 4000 gold.
[5622.98s -> 5634.82s]  Mage guild one scholar. Okay, hold on a minute. Allows you to recruit evil eyes. Yes. Oh damn.
[5634.82s -> 5641.37s]  Okay, what's the difference? Beholders evil eyes. So beholder is just that. This is no melee penalty.
[5642.82s -> 5649.86s]  10 attack, 8 defense. Just better. Shoots 24 shots. 3 to 5. 3 to 5 health. It's just better
[5649.86s -> 5668.76s]  in every way. Eyes for days. I have upgrades here. All right, looking good. Citadel. Let's go for it.
[5671.98s -> 5684.04s]  More growth. Now I gotta relax. You gotta upgrade the gremlins? Yeah, I'm...
[5685.00s -> 5687.80s]  Yeah, I know. You're right. Hold on. I'm scared that something bad's gonna happen.
[5688.44s -> 5692.46s]  Look at this person getting all the fucking stuff in the ocean. That's what I wanted to do.
[5693.59s -> 5718.66s]  No. What do I got? 4600 workshop. Master gremlins. Okay, here we go. They're just like
[5718.74s -> 5728.10s]  Fantasia monsters. All right, so this is 3344. Oh, they're ranged. They can be ranged. Okay,
[5728.10s -> 5735.19s]  damage one to two. Yeah, these are better. I gotta upgrade. I gotta bring people in here.
[5735.19s -> 5742.20s]  Who has all the gremlins? You do. You have a lot of these just like shitty gremlins.
[5744.62s -> 5751.37s]  Blacksmith. Let's get that city hall up. Only visiting heroes may use the blacksmith.
[5751.37s -> 5755.82s]  I can't like use that? I guess I don't have anything to use it. All right, what else? Anything
[5755.82s -> 5771.10s]  else in here? Upgrade the warren. Infernal frogs. Oh, okay. Immune to blinding. Okay,
[5771.10s -> 5775.26s]  so they attack five four. They're just better. One to three. Health. Have more health.
[5776.06s -> 5781.37s]  So they turn from green onions into like Triceratops or Stegosaurus or whatever.
[5782.33s -> 5798.10s]  Okay, that looks good. Good luck. Increased attack. So we got some upgraded frogs.
[5799.06s -> 5807.08s]  Now, I need to start moving around. You have such shit. You have such bad,
[5809.26s -> 5816.10s]  you I could move around though. We have to, we have to do something. I gotta get some,
[5816.10s -> 5821.51s]  I gotta move around here. At least one of these things. Let's go to the windmill.
[5823.99s -> 5831.82s]  Three gems. We're in the windmill. Okay. Lots of sin to our captains. I'm too afraid to
[5832.06s -> 5846.36s]  pursue. Packing nomads. I think I could take them. Let's go. All right, this is a lot though.
[5846.36s -> 5854.31s]  These guys are fucking strong, aren't they? I mean, kind of, kind of, but it's all right.
[5855.19s -> 5867.40s]  All right, we're good. Defend here. I don't want to just give them a free hit. I don't think they
[5867.40s -> 5874.17s]  can make it. They're not going to make it. He's not going to make it. Wait for them. This guy
[5874.17s -> 5891.85s]  though will be here in time. He will make it. Just get up there. Nice. There you go. There you go.
[5891.85s -> 5897.86s]  There you go. There you go. There you go. Not going to make it. He made it. Blocked. Holy shit.
[5897.86s -> 5905.22s]  You fucking hero. What an absolute fucking monster of a unit. No, he's all right. He's all right.
[5905.86s -> 5913.22s]  All right. What we got? Gargoyles. Let's go down here. There's only three down here. Bang.
[5913.22s -> 5930.65s]  Bang. Crap around the side. Yeah, we're good. We're good. This is not that bad. I can't believe
[5930.65s -> 5941.08s]  that didn't kill you. You really want to get rid of the gremlins, huh? Yeah, that's it. Say what?
[5942.66s -> 5953.26s]  Okay. I was scared for that for some reason. 420 experience. That'll give us the one crystal a day.
[5954.46s -> 5960.20s]  Pack of wood elves. I should be able to take them as well. I still have plenty of points. I got
[5960.20s -> 5966.34s]  plenty of people. I should be able to get these wood elves, but they've ranged. That's the only
[5966.34s -> 5971.78s]  thing that concerns me. No, let's just park it right here. I need like to get the other hero going,
[5972.50s -> 5982.38s]  but he just, you can't do any exploring with this group of fucking idiots. Is uh,
[5982.38s -> 5997.88s]  necromancy automatic? I think it is. Let's keep going. Oh no. Again? They're going to take it.
[5997.88s -> 6030.57s]  Again? Not again. What do we got here? Whose ranged? The whites. Oh man. Ah man. I can't get
[6030.57s -> 6037.75s]  over there. I have just the towers, but he's going to cast spells and kill the violet.
[6038.39s -> 6062.94s]  I have such a small crew. This is bad. Uh, not good. Very bad. Very bad. Very bad. Very bad. Very bad.
[6062.94s -> 6074.12s]  Very bad. Very bad. It's over. It's over. Yeah. I just have to accept the defeat here.
[6077.72s -> 6082.04s]  He's going to just shoot. Oh, he's going to shoot through every time. How much, how many
[6082.04s -> 6098.46s]  spell points does he have? Yeah, I'm dead. Yeah, that's it. Game over. Oh, it was my like younger
[6098.46s -> 6110.66s]  brother, Thane. Came to attack Thane's. Thane came to get Thane's stuff. Thane versus Thane.
[6110.66s -> 6122.54s]  Astrologers proclaim week of the badger. All dwellings have increased population.
[6122.54s -> 6130.89s]  That's why we need to like, ah, this is going to have to be our real stronghold.
[6131.61s -> 6141.98s]  I spread myself a little too thin here. All right. What about this? This is a good place. Let's
[6142.54s -> 6152.17s]  really upgrade this stuff. Obsidian gargoyles, iron golems, can recruit mages. How much is this?
[6152.89s -> 6168.68s]  Let's get some mages and 1800 recruit everybody. No, not yet. Not yet. Mages are damn good.
[6168.92s -> 6173.18s]  But I'm not going to get them yet because I have to upgrade these guys. Let's get at least the
[6173.18s -> 6182.33s]  mages. Yeah, these guys are awesome. And let's pull up the gremlins because we already have,
[6183.13s -> 6188.81s]  obviously, the upgrade there. Get them all. That's all I can afford.
[6192.65s -> 6198.97s]  Fuck, I'm out of money. They're going to attack the city from the portal.
[6200.14s -> 6214.14s]  Fuck, they're going to come for that town next week from this portal. I've got four wizards
[6214.14s -> 6218.14s]  protecting it. I don't have any money. I should have fucking taken the money before in the
[6218.14s -> 6227.74s]  beginning. I've got to start to fucking cash in something here. I have to try to make something
[6227.74s -> 6234.89s]  happen. Do you wish to pursue him? No, let him run. I want to go into the arena. You enter the arena
[6234.89s -> 6240.33s]  and face a pack of vicious lions. You handily defeat them to the wild cheers of the crowd.
[6240.33s -> 6245.05s]  Impressed by your skill, the age trainer of gladiators agrees to train you in a skill of
[6245.05s -> 6250.52s]  your choice, plus two attack or plus two defense. This could be the run saver right here.
[6255.00s -> 6262.66s]  Attack. That's pretty damn good. Oh, there's defense. I don't have any.
[6263.54s -> 6273.45s]  Okay, that was good. That was good. I need a hero. Lots of harpy hags, lots of centaur captains.
[6274.17s -> 6287.19s]  The university is over here. The war machine factory. I don't know. A pack of silver pegasi.
[6287.19s -> 6293.02s]  Can I get them? I might be able to kill them. Don't come attack me, please. Don't come attack
[6293.02s -> 6331.03s]  me. Don't come. What happened? What? Where was that? It was a scripted event. It was just a
[6331.03s -> 6339.75s]  scenario event. I had to pay like somebody robbed me taxes. Oh, that was actual taxes. I needed that
[6339.75s -> 6347.61s]  money this week, this day. So bad. Fuck. Okay, well, here we go. I would have just bought another one
[6347.61s -> 6359.48s]  of these. I need the money. I need the money. I need the money. I have to recruit people.
[6369.74s -> 6378.73s]  Lots of, no, not lots of Harpies. Let's get the gold. 600 temple. Got some luck. All right. More
[6378.73s -> 6392.36s]  gold and a pack of silver pegasi during like Christmas or something. This is bad. I can't do
[6392.36s -> 6404.63s]  it. What about the harpy hags? I might be able to get the Harpies. There's an obelisk right here.
[6405.27s -> 6426.98s]  I'm not sure what I want to do here. Lots of harpy hags. No. I'm fucked. I'm so fucked. I just need
[6426.98s -> 6439.26s]  to just dial up the defense. Recruit. No, not yet. Hold on. Obsidian gargoyles. There we go. All
[6439.26s -> 6451.85s]  right. Pull them in. Let's see the difference. Speed. They're just faster. Okay. Now how much
[6451.85s -> 6467.94s]  money do I got? 13. Recruit as many as I can. I have 1300. Come on. Recruit. Wait, what?
[6469.00s -> 6480.06s]  Oh, okay. I can't afford it. I have to at least have something here. I have 30 gold. Fuck. I'm
[6480.06s -> 6490.12s]  in so much trouble. Why do they have to take all my money? I was just getting ready. Guys like
[6490.12s -> 6503.74s]  sailing the seven goddamn seas. Okay. 3000. Recruit everybody. There we go. I have now the
[6503.74s -> 6515.24s]  obsidian gargoyles, a bunch of magic remlins. This is at least protected. This one-way portal
[6515.24s -> 6528.14s]  is an awful danger. Can I close it? Can I close this portal? This guy? Okay. Should I just go fuck
[6528.14s -> 6548.66s]  this guy up? Lots of skeletons. Lots of frogs. I'm going to buy a new hero and we're going to storm
[6548.66s -> 6558.12s]  the castle and I'm going to take it back. I need somebody in here though. Look at that picture.
[6558.76s -> 6563.16s]  Level one knight or level one wizard? I think that's the first thing I'm doing.
[6563.96s -> 6571.94s]  Don't go in that portal. He's looking at it. I can tell. Go up there and- go up there and get
[6571.94s -> 6577.21s]  your ass kicked. Go take that squirrel and die. Please go up there. He doesn't know.
[6582.68s -> 6593.08s]  What's over here? I can go over here and go down. Let's go to the imp cache. This has been- have I
[6593.08s -> 6599.62s]  visited this yet? I don't think so. Don't come in here. Don't go in the portal. Don't go in the
[6599.62s -> 6613.16s]  portal. Oh. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Somebody else came. Oh god. Purple just came up
[6613.16s -> 6618.20s]  and just murdered him. Go up there and die. He's going to go touch it. What do you have?
[6618.92s -> 6629.29s]  He's got like treants and griffins and mutants and- oh no. Okay. Take the castle now. Take the
[6629.29s -> 6642.22s]  castle now. All right. Here we go. Ready? Let's get level one genie. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[6642.86s -> 6647.34s]  Oh yeah. Upgrade him. We're going to get the castle. We're gonna just put the walls up.
[6647.34s -> 6664.70s]  Okay. We need to upgrade these guys. Oh Jesus, man. 64 of them. Stone garg upgrade. Dude. All
[6664.70s -> 6679.10s]  right. I'm ready. Let's go. Let's go get the castle. Well, there's nobody in it. There's nobody in here.
[6679.10s -> 6703.13s]  It's mine. Sucker. Hey, thanks for the fucking upgrades. You dummy. You're not going to get
[6703.13s -> 6706.73s]  over here. Yeah. I don't have- how do I get money? But hold on. How do I- can I-
[6707.45s -> 6712.74s]  I'm going to exchange something because I need- I need money. Hold on. I got a lot of-
[6713.22s -> 6728.04s]  Uh, hold on. This is important. I need castle. I need 5,000 gold. How do I get five grand
[6728.04s -> 6744.71s]  right now? Go to the market. I want- no, no. I want this. What do I get for this? Okay. I
[6744.71s -> 6748.07s]  can do it. I can do it. I can do it. Hold on. What's the- what's the best one? What's the most
[6748.07s -> 6760.52s]  expensive? Gems? 100. 50. 100. 100. They're all 100. Okay. I think I could get rid of
[6761.32s -> 6777.35s]  some pots. Sell the red crayons. 10. I don't think I need mercury for anything right now.
[6778.15s -> 6788.82s]  I need to get to 5,000. I need wood. What about the- okay, what about sulfur? I could do 10
[6788.82s -> 6802.87s]  sulfur, 10 pots, 10 ore, which is 3,000. I'm going for it. I have to. Selective blindness.
[6803.96s -> 6822.95s]  I did it. Okay. We're gonna do- I don't have enough wood. Wait. What do you mean? I fucking
[6822.95s -> 6831.91s]  need 10 wood. Wait before- hold on. Before I go any further. Hold on, Ed. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[6831.91s -> 6841.21s]  important. Oh! Eat shit game. Eat shit game. Eat shit game. I'm gonna win this. I'm gonna- I'm
[6841.21s -> 6857.61s]  gonna hold the castle. All right. What's more important? Restore spell points with the gems
[6858.41s -> 6862.89s]  and the- can I get the gem factory? No, not yet. I'm gonna go to the imp cache.
[6864.81s -> 6873.59s]  You found an imp cache. Do you wish to attack the guards? The portal near your base is one way.
[6882.12s -> 6887.51s]  Where- they're out. Okay, this is a different scenario here. Hold on. They're just weak. It's
[6887.51s -> 6900.95s]  okay. I'm gonna go for bottom right. Bottom left. Yeah, I'll win this. It's a lot of imps, but
[6901.03s -> 6905.83s]  they're not- they're not strong enough. You just got to go twice. That was bullshit.
[6910.70s -> 6918.97s]  No, they ain't gonna win. The retaliation alone. Let me see here. Magic arrow. Let's just try to
[6918.97s -> 6929.05s]  just melt one of these. I'm gonna just melt the guy over here. Absolutely melt it. Okay, just
[6929.05s -> 6936.02s]  attack the thing right next to you. Should kill it. Things weak as hell. Skeletons go down here.
[6936.50s -> 6946.74s]  I better get something good for this. I don't need to waste my magic here. Yeah, gargoyles.
[6946.74s -> 6963.19s]  Yeah, same thing down here. Skeletons are really good. I can't wait to upgrade them.
[6964.07s -> 6984.86s]  Right here. Just move over here. Drop them. Come on. Get this one up. Hopefully there's a bunch of
[6984.86s -> 6998.10s]  money in here because that was actually to solve every problem I have. Dude, they're doing so good.
[6998.18s -> 7010.46s]  Doing so good. Gremlins are doing really good. All right. 800 experience. 200 imps dead. All right.
[7010.46s -> 7020.71s]  Lost some people, but it's okay. All right. Level five necromancer. Expert eagle eye or basic wisdom.
[7020.71s -> 7031.26s]  I learned attack plus one. That's good. 60% chance to learn any spell up to fourth level used in
[7031.26s -> 7037.99s]  combat. Or I can actually learn third level spells. That's, yeah, that's better.
[7039.24s -> 7046.78s]  Having defeated the imps, you discover four mercury and two thousand gold. I have done it.
[7047.34s -> 7060.50s]  I've done it. Got it. I've done it. Good. I still need wood. Is there any wood down here?
[7061.06s -> 7073.05s]  Oh, it's like a shipyard. There's no wood though. Well, let me just, I can visit this once a day
[7073.05s -> 7076.89s]  anyways. So I might as well just, I don't think I can do anything else. Shrine of magic gesture.
[7077.53s -> 7088.30s]  Remove obstacle. I just learned. Nice. Okay. Cool. Very cool. Very cool. All right. But this
[7088.30s -> 7091.10s]  lumber here, somebody's right outside the door. I gotta remember that. It's important to remember.
[7091.10s -> 7097.34s]  Okay. Wait, wait. Which door? So this is a one way entrance. So that person can't even get over here,
[7097.98s -> 7116.42s]  but they can go here. So I need to build. I need 10 wood. I noticed. Yeah, no, I know that. I've read
[7116.42s -> 7121.26s]  it in the chat a few times. No, I know. I knew that. I knew that like 20, 15, 20 minutes ago.
[7121.74s -> 7131.99s]  Yeah, I know. I didn't know that before that, but no, I read. I read that. I did. I'm concerned.
[7132.87s -> 7142.01s]  We both went through it. So no one's, there's nobody going to live through this. This scenario
[7142.01s -> 7147.70s]  here is no one is going, no one's going to live through this. Like I have to get on the boat.
[7149.54s -> 7164.55s]  So it's either take it or don't. I need wood. I need wood. I'm willing to spend.
[7165.93s -> 7175.38s]  What am I willing to spend? That's the best. It's just three. I could give some sulfur. I need how
[7175.38s -> 7200.34s]  much? I need 10. I could do six sulfur. I could do nine. I need one more. We could do gems. Okay.
[7203.10s -> 7226.34s]  I will now have two arrow towers, fortified defenses and doubled growth. Bring it on.
[7226.34s -> 7238.81s]  Just hang out in here. Don't move. Save the game. That's a good idea. Okay. I'm fucking nervous
[7238.81s -> 7244.84s]  because I can't like, that's really nice of you to build that for the purple guy just to take it.
[7245.56s -> 7255.85s]  I still have a couple of cities. I'm going to piss my pants. I'll be right back. Two minutes.
[7355.34s -> 7403.43s]  Here we go. All right. So I've got no money. I've got defenses. I've got a very large amount of
[7403.43s -> 7417.59s]  people that are going to try to come kill me. This does not bode well. Let's go. There you go. Bring
[7417.59s -> 7424.95s]  it on. Or go up top of the spell book and get killed. Here we go. Okay. 160 fucking eight. Look
[7424.95s -> 7430.15s]  at that. I got, they shot three times. All right. I got an opportunity. Here we go. All right. Let
[7430.15s -> 7435.46s]  me think about this for a second. I just dropped all their hobbits are gone immediately. Chained
[7435.46s -> 7453.48s]  lightning. Chained lightning strikes four units. Will this bounce around? If I do it right here,
[7453.48s -> 7470.86s]  is this going to be catastrophic? What do I start it on? Are we over here? Oh, that's not very good.
[7471.42s -> 7479.70s]  Oh, that's not very good. Oh, that's not very good. Defend. I can't do anything with you unless
[7479.70s -> 7490.54s]  somebody gets closer. Ah, okay. I got to kill these archers, but it's not going to be good.
[7491.42s -> 7503.40s]  There's so many centaurs. I think I have to go for the centaurs.
[7504.76s -> 7517.34s]  Mm. No, I got to go for you. The oil could get them. That's not a whole lot. It's not doing a
[7517.34s -> 7536.23s]  lot of damage. 27. Fuck. Oh, come on. Fire it. Kill them. They're getting in. They got in. They got
[7536.23s -> 7546.34s]  in. They got in. They got in. Quick. Go this way. What do I do? She got in. Spells. Stone skin.
[7548.76s -> 7562.07s]  Stone skin. Stone skin. Get in there. Oh, I'm dead. Oh, we're dead. This is very bad.
[7565.82s -> 7577.03s]  17. I got to kill the immediate threat. Kill the immediate threat. Come on. They can't get in yet.
[7578.63s -> 7602.22s]  15. Oh, shit. This is so bad. I'm dead. It's game over. That's it. They got, they breached. The
[7602.22s -> 7610.10s]  Pegasus breached. There's not much else I can do. I mean, I get to spell. No, I don't have any
[7610.10s -> 7620.15s]  points. I don't have any points left. We just die. Maybe next time. It's not over yet, but it will be
[7620.15s -> 7633.96s]  very soon. We just have to try to kill the Pegasus. My only hope is sincerely that the archers on top
[7633.96s -> 7646.52s]  will do a lot of damage here. Don't surrender. Just get up here. I got three archers. They're
[7646.52s -> 7663.05s]  going in the mud. They only have 12. Dammit. Not good. Now they're outlandish. Bad. One hit.
[7663.85s -> 7676.97s]  One hit kill. 149. Instantly kill. Oh, no. That's it. I got nothing left. I got nothing left.
[7678.95s -> 7701.99s]  Oh, fuck. Oh, well. I tried. All I got is you. 5,000 gold. Gone. It's not over. It's not over.
[7702.71s -> 7716.28s]  I still have a bustling city here. Not over. This thing. I just have this for the fucking
[7716.28s -> 7736.55s]  gold at this point. I need a mage tower level one. I need money. It's not over. It's not over.
[7737.11s -> 7749.80s]  There's still plenty of possibilities. I'm going to try to get over here. I'm just going to refill
[7749.80s -> 7761.19s]  my points. There's like a pack of dwarves. I can get rid of them. Would you look at that?
[7761.19s -> 7765.27s]  A group of battle dwarves with a desire for greater glory wish to join you. Yes, I accept.
[7768.74s -> 7784.18s]  Well, that could have just potentially changed everything. 7, 12, 7, 22 health. Shipyard. Boat.
[7784.74s -> 7794.01s]  All right. Things are looking up. There's nobody in this area, right? Better not be. No, it's just
[7794.01s -> 7802.12s]  me. Changed everything again. Summon boat. That was the different character. I don't have that
[7802.12s -> 7811.22s]  ability. Holy fuck. I can summon boat. I thought that was a different character. It's this guy.
[7811.22s -> 7816.58s]  This is the guy that has the boat ability. All right. I know what I'm doing. Here we go. Don't
[7816.58s -> 7826.78s]  kill me. There's somebody dangerously close to where I am. All right. Get the gold. Lots of
[7826.78s -> 7839.13s]  walking dead. And then a golem factory. Don't pursue. Golem factory. Much to your dismay,
[7839.13s -> 7844.90s]  the golem factory is guarded by a pack of gold golems. Do you wish to fight the guards?
[7850.82s -> 7857.51s]  I don't think that's wise. That would be very unwise. Give me the boat. I have 20 points.
[7858.39s -> 7869.34s]  Summon boat. God damn it. Do it again. Summon a boat. I got heads twice.
[7870.30s -> 7876.79s]  Fuck. This strange eye turns and studies you as you approach. After a few moments,
[7876.79s -> 7881.43s]  it returns to its slow scan of the area. You can't help it feel like someone or something
[7881.43s -> 7892.01s]  is using the eye to spy from another location. There's a shipwreck survivor right here.
[7893.21s -> 7898.70s]  Come on. I got to get over here. Look at all this. There's so much stuff untapped potential
[7898.70s -> 7917.02s]  over here. I need that fucking boat. Now. All right. I've got some money. Resource silo. More
[7917.02s -> 7930.25s]  gems. Increase obsidian and gargoyle production by four. Wall of knowledge. Let's get it. Yeah.
[7930.25s -> 7943.19s]  More growth. Better troops. Don't kill me, please. I give up on this one. All right. You know what?
[7943.19s -> 7946.63s]  This one. How many? How much is it? No, not even worth it. You can just have them if you take it.
[7947.35s -> 7959.02s]  There's nothing here. This place sucks. This is the one that I don't care about. I already
[7959.02s -> 7967.34s]  took all this shit, but this is going to get cleaned. This motherfucker's just sailing the
[7967.34s -> 7984.41s]  seven seas. I can't afford a boat. How can I not afford a boat? I have $9,000. Wood?
[7987.82s -> 7997.43s]  But okay, so riddle me this. Does summon boat. Summons an existing, friendly, unoccupied boat.
[7998.57s -> 8005.46s]  Oh god damn it. I need to have, I need to have a boat first. How much is a boat?
[8006.34s -> 8026.81s]  How much is a boat? I need a castle. $5,010.10. I'm building a castle. I need to get to this
[8026.81s -> 8037.59s]  capital. $4,000 gold a day. I need to, I just need things. Where's the market? What do I need?
[8042.78s -> 8055.37s]  It's so much and not worth it. Terrible exchange rate. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, four.
[8056.25s -> 8082.46s]  I need to, I need to start upgrading. Bad. Two more. Sell some of my bitcoins?
[8083.34s -> 8090.49s]  Oh, what do you mean? They, I don't have any of these. Two more wood. I'm going to just take it
[8090.49s -> 8098.42s]  from here. No, I'm not. I'm just depleting my resources. These are so necessary. All right.
[8099.74s -> 8106.58s]  Castle. Adds two arrow towers. Fortifies town defenses, doubles creature growth. Build it.
[8107.85s -> 8122.82s]  I can now, $10,000 for a capital building. I need a lumber mill. I need wood. I need a lumber mill.
[8122.82s -> 8136.14s]  This is what, that's it. This gives me like one wood a day. Where is there a lumber mill? I need
[8136.14s -> 8144.18s]  that fucking boat. I think I'm going to go attack this guy. Over this guy. Lots of gogs. Pack of
[8144.18s -> 8152.57s]  stone golems. I'm starting to go in the goblin factory. What do you think? Should I try to do
[8152.57s -> 8167.75s]  this? Wow. Whoever green is, he sucks. If I just did the, I didn't, I don't know how much it is for
[8167.75s -> 8181.74s]  a boat. Is it ten wood? I'm giving myself a restart point because if this is just horrible,
[8181.74s -> 8193.96s]  then I'm just restarting again. Go. Fuck, okay. So it's, this won't be, I don't think this will be
[8193.96s -> 8210.79s]  horrible. Shield. Magic arrow. Who's more dangerous here? Down here. I can't reach it though.
[8211.27s -> 8231.74s]  Oh, he's magic immune? Oh shit! I, uh, they're both magic immune. Whatever, it's fine. What do I have
[8231.74s -> 8241.10s]  right now? Gargoyle. How far can they walk? They can walk kind of far. I do have the dwarves.
[8241.66s -> 8250.62s]  All right, dwarves are going in the bottom. Not enough. Good. Okay. I have no range. I have hue
[8250.62s -> 8260.07s]  though. Uh, you defend. You also defend. No, go up like a little bit. You go down here to back up
[8260.07s -> 8273.90s]  the dwarves. Nice shot. All right. Gargoyle time. Stay here. Nice. Okay. Dwarves. This is where you
[8273.90s -> 8318.01s]  wanted to join a better cause. Pretty good tank. Stay with it. No! Good. Just, I gotta go for it.
[8319.69s -> 8324.71s]  Five. Go for the one that's damaged.
[8324.71s -> 8342.42s]  Get the skeletons down here. There's 50 of these guys. You're next in line. In fact, you wrap around
[8342.42s -> 8355.40s]  here. Four left. Oh, there they go. There they go. There they go. They fought for glory. Bring in the
[8355.40s -> 8374.42s]  skeletons. 49 versus four. Big damage here. Very good. And I mean very good. Nice. You're just trying
[8374.42s -> 8383.37s]  to take a plate space at this point. Gargoyles are dead here. Good. That's what I wanted you to do.
[8384.01s -> 8398.38s]  All right. Bring in the gremlins from top left. Kill this. Done. All right. It's almost impossible
[8398.38s -> 8413.13s]  for me to lose this. This better be worth it. Surrounded by all sides. Six. Go this way. 49
[8413.13s -> 8422.41s]  skeletons. This thing is so strong. Imagine having like more than 20 of these. It'd be
[8422.41s -> 8442.52s]  unbeatable. Almost, gremlins are almost dead. Thank god. 810 experience. The golem factory is
[8442.52s -> 8454.12s]  now no longer defended. Oh. Oh. My god. Okay. How much money do I have? Fruit, iron, golem.
[8454.68s -> 8464.01s]  I can bring in a bunch. Bring them all in. Can I, how much can I have? This is diamond golems.
[8464.01s -> 8473.30s]  I definitely want at least two of these. Diamond. Gold golems. Just how many, okay I got one more
[8473.30s -> 8485.70s]  slot. No actually I don't. I, because these are stone. I can get them all. At least, okay I can
[8485.70s -> 8497.29s]  fill it up. That's good. Two diamond. Three gold. Seven stone now. I spent all my money. That's okay.
[8505.67s -> 8521.53s]  These guys are so tough. Now I can go up here and get this now. For sure. Guaranteed. Now it's time
[8521.53s -> 8529.00s]  to save for a boat and hope I don't get attacked. I don't like where that guy's going. I don't like
[8529.00s -> 8537.58s]  the boats that you're on. Astrologist proclaim week of the wyvern monarch. Wyvern monarch growth
[8537.58s -> 8548.12s]  plus five. Well I don't have those. Lots of people to recruit but I don't have the money.
[8548.92s -> 8562.81s]  I could get another hero. No don't do that. I need money. I need wood. Save the game. Looks good so
[8562.81s -> 8599.29s]  far. Lots of rates. I have a great team here. I mean I'm going hard. Let's go. Oh fuck you.
[8601.26s -> 8615.75s]  Fucking goddamn taxes again. I'm broke still. Go on. Come on over here. You ain't got nothing.
[8619.16s -> 8627.26s]  Um I don't think you can make it. I'm gonna defend. Maybe actually defend with most everybody. Let's
[8627.26s -> 8634.74s]  put you guys out there. Put the skeletons out here too. Uh yeah because I don't want to lose any of
[8634.74s -> 8652.23s]  these guys. I want them to be incredibly safe. Drains enemy mana. Let's see if I can do something
[8652.23s -> 8660.58s]  here. Be slow. Let's see if this works. Not bad. Uh defend. I don't want them going out there.
[8661.46s -> 8673.21s]  It's okay. This is pretty good so far. All right we've got diamond. Diamond go and I this might
[8673.21s -> 8686.49s]  be a one hit kill. Not really but it was still pretty good. Yeah I have just these slow moving
[8686.49s -> 8692.17s]  assholes. The skeletons are the best. They just truly are. Look at this. They're so good.
[8693.05s -> 8708.52s]  Don't hit the diamond. Thank you. Only lost a few skeletons. Here we go. Knowledge plus one.
[8708.52s -> 8713.08s]  Basic resistance. Basic resistance endows a hero's troops with five percent magic resistance.
[8714.20s -> 8728.44s]  Yeah take it. Here we go. Now I get some good. What is this? One a day. Well I could probably
[8728.44s -> 8741.99s]  do this now. Although let me get the points. It's 30. What are we doing? All the taxes took
[8741.99s -> 8757.58s]  all my money so I can't do anything. We got this. The imp cash. I've got 3500. We're gonna go up
[8759.61s -> 8776.54s]  to just the warm machine factory. The Harpies. I think I can take them. Or the cent. No.
[8777.58s -> 8783.86s]  Let me take a look at the map because I need to start to move out somewhere. I own that stuff.
[8787.93s -> 8792.57s]  I really just I need. What about up here? Pack of stone golems. Okay I can do this.
[8792.57s -> 8803.50s]  I can get up here. We can get the this stuff here. Yeah move up here. This is the good old
[8803.50s -> 8809.45s]  games version. This is not the HD remaster. This is the good old games version with the community
[8809.45s -> 8823.62s]  HD patch. I need 10 000 gold to do that. I don't have that yet unfortunately. Oh that stuff he's
[8823.62s -> 8834.76s]  getting. I need to get out there. The tomb. Did not go to the windmill yet. Take the three.
[8836.28s -> 8846.73s]  Uh this is the rally flag. I can grab this. Walking morale up. Might as well touch it.
[8847.53s -> 8861.69s]  Okay I'm ready. A pack of golems. I have a pack of golems too. Let's go. They're just clearing all
[8861.69s -> 8879.64s]  the... I'm dead. Pack of stone golems. Nine and nine. I mean I'm gonna win. I'm gonna keep the
[8879.72s -> 8897.70s]  skeletons back here. I really want to just have... I want to attack first so then everybody defend.
[8898.42s -> 8903.03s]  Yeah I don't want to I don't want to be the one that gets hit. Let them come to us
[8905.35s -> 8913.54s]  like that. All right you are gonna go... Let's just overwhelm this one. Overwhelm this guy with
[8913.54s -> 8932.68s]  everybody. He's running away. He's going down here. Overwhelm. You stay back. Uh oh not good.
[8932.68s -> 8955.94s]  You gotta... We gotta get up there. Fuck. You go up there. Lock. Get rid of this one.
[8957.32s -> 8966.47s]  Three versus... There we go. We should do it. One more. Fuck. He's come with my skeletons. I know he
[8966.47s -> 8977.83s]  is. Why am I holding back the skeletons? Because I can... If I if I don't lose any skeletons I can
[8977.83s -> 8985.22s]  have like a hundred of them. Remember anytime one point is ticked off there's a chance that it adds
[8985.22s -> 8999.50s]  to my skeleton stack. So I mean I'm just I'm going like skeletons. We're good. Actually probably
[8999.50s -> 9009.30s]  good to get. No not worth it. So I have 49 now. I only lost three people. I should maybe have some
[9009.30s -> 9020.18s]  more. Let's see what I got now. 53 skeletons now. Alchemist's lab. I've already visited this.
[9021.93s -> 9027.86s]  Bingo. I now have one of those a day and then there's something... Artifact. What is it? Gog.
[9028.58s -> 9041.11s]  Got some gremlins. Is it gog? Scary. I don't know if I can fight this. I don't know what a gog is.
[9049.53s -> 9060.33s]  They're ranged. Lots of gogs. I do. Resource silo. Lookout tower.
[9062.23s -> 9071.35s]  Alter bushes. Genies. Genies or capital building? Genies.
[9075.18s -> 9083.74s]  Okay capital. I'll have a decent amount to recruit after this. I don't want to... I can't... I don't
[9083.74s -> 9102.38s]  want to waste money here. Get one city ready to go. He's coming. No. This guy's clear. That orange
[9102.38s -> 9108.17s]  is clearing out. Oh fuck. He got in a boat. He got in a boat. This guy got in a boat. Where's he
[9108.17s -> 9117.78s]  going? He could go down here and then... Oh no he's in a boat. He finally got one. He's gonna go down
[9117.78s -> 9128.10s]  and he's gonna come over here and he's gonna meet me over here. I'm fucked. Okay I gotta be ready
[9128.10s -> 9146.30s]  for this. Is it worth trying to get this artifact? I have some decent army. Let's go. This is not
[9146.30s -> 9166.84s]  that... there's only 11 of them. Yeah they're weak. Get up there. Checkmate in five turns. No we got
[9166.84s -> 9183.67s]  this. I'm gonna... I'm just gonna move the skeletons up there anyways. Ballista. Nice. Yeah it is.
[9184.55s -> 9198.01s]  Hopefully that that artifact I'm hoping is a uh a table turner if you know what I mean. Go this way.
[9198.01s -> 9216.23s]  One hit kill. Not quite. Almost a one hit kill. Good job. You can just sit here. Nice. Lost a couple
[9216.23s -> 9229.82s]  of skeletons but that's all right. There it is. Cape of Velocity. What does it do? Warn about the
[9229.82s -> 9241.37s]  shoulders. This cape increases the combat speed of all your units by plus two. I mean it's all right.
[9241.37s -> 9248.54s]  That's okay. That's pretty good. I can move more. That's good. Backpack. I don't have any backpack.
[9249.58s -> 9269.43s]  Nothing else up here. I'm delaying the inevitable. Here we go. Capital. Chris your kingdom to 4,000
[9269.43s -> 9283.61s]  gold a day. It's done. Now I need to upgrade. Uh this has already been done. This has already
[9283.61s -> 9291.66s]  been done. I need to do the Golem Factory. Do that another time. Speaking of Golem Factories,
[9293.16s -> 9305.14s]  I want to go back to the Golem Factory and hopefully I'll have 10 by then. I'll have 10
[9305.14s -> 9312.04s]  by then. Because I'm scared of the guy on the damn boat. I don't know where he's gonna go.
[9320.55s -> 9330.46s]  It's so scary. Someone's gonna be waiting for me down here.
[9331.26s -> 9334.81s]  This is so close. Look at how close he is. He's in the boat right there.
[9336.54s -> 9351.56s]  Uh 10. I have 10. I'm not gonna be able to make it. Not even close. Castle. Taravan. Wall of Nod.
[9351.56s -> 9362.55s]  Lookout Tower. Resource silo. One gem. Golden Pavilion. Or the genies. Genies or the uh nagas.
[9364.01s -> 9369.06s]  Probably nagas. They're the ultimate unit. No no no. Giants are the ultimate unit.
[9369.06s -> 9391.22s]  We'll go genie. Okay genie now available. 13 to 16 damage. That's pretty good. They're available.
[9392.97s -> 9398.95s]  I've got 10 wood. Don't worry I know I just spent five but trust me it's gonna take me at least
[9398.95s -> 9408.47s]  like four or five days to even get down here. If we get a new week we'll have a ton of people.
[9409.11s -> 9427.70s]  All right I'm ready. Here we go. He's going down to the islands.
[9427.70s -> 9433.27s]  Fuck. He's gonna get all this shit before I am. All dwellings increase population again.
[9435.96s -> 9447.64s]  Come on. Give me to the boat. I'm so close. What do I got? I have so many people to recruit. How
[9447.64s -> 9462.89s]  much is it? 95 80. I have so many recruits. Save the money. I'm gonna just get barely down here.
[9463.86s -> 9477.80s]  This guy's gonna take all the cool shit. Let's go. That's all I can do. Just don't go to this
[9477.80s -> 9486.70s]  cool island. I want to go to the island. He's on the island. Oh he's on the island right now.
[9487.34s -> 9495.91s]  They're scooping up fucking taxes. Wow. Why? What the fuck? What? They took all my wood. I had
[9497.27s -> 9526.76s]  you took all my wood. Damn it. I'm so disappointed right now. I gotta go for it. I have to.
[9538.07s -> 9557.14s]  This is too much money. I'm not using gold. Yeah but this is every cent I have. Just to get seven
[9557.14s -> 9604.04s]  I can get one two three. Give me the boat now. Boat please. That's it. It was only a thousand.
[9604.04s -> 9609.24s]  Give me a boat. Get in the boat. We're in the boat. Boys and girls we've made it. We're gonna go rescue
[9609.24s -> 9630.82s]  this person. I have no more turn points. He don't come over here. Oh he's on the island. That's my
[9630.82s -> 9640.47s]  island. That's my island survivor. I've been looking forward to this. You pulled a shipwreck
[9640.47s -> 9645.67s]  survivor from certain death in an unforgiving ocean. Grateful he rewards you for your act of
[9645.67s -> 9660.23s]  kindness by giving you the crown of the supreme magi. While on your head this item increases your
[9660.23s -> 9681.75s]  knowledge by plus four. That's a lot of points. 70 spell points. Favorable winds. Rock. Chip.
[9682.63s -> 9689.83s]  Where do I go? But he's on here too. What does he have? Stryker the death knight. What do you got?
[9691.34s -> 9695.42s]  Oh he's dead. He's fucking dead. Look at this shit. He's got nothing. He's so depleted. Let's go get
[9695.42s -> 9709.69s]  him. This dude is fucked. He's got nothing. He has like three zombies. Stay here. I have no more. I
[9709.69s -> 9719.69s]  got him. Don't leave here. There he goes. There he goes. He's right here. Did he get it? No. Where is
[9719.69s -> 9735.90s]  he? Where did this motherfucker go? Is he inside? That's his boat right there. He knows I'm coming
[9735.90s -> 9753.43s]  for him. Coming for you. Hey is that uh your boat back here? Oh fancy seeing you here. Oh so you're
[9753.43s -> 9769.53s]  gonna go in that? There's a bunch of uh orcs in there. You're dead. Bye. The mistake was taking
[9769.53s -> 9776.10s]  this. Do you see how many times this castle has changed hands? Like five times at least. This is
[9776.10s -> 9796.76s]  just a dead zone here. I will kill you. You have one person? This must... I mean this is a scout.
[9797.86s -> 9812.44s]  This is just a scout. Yeah. You've captured an enemy artifact. Endless bag of gold and bow of
[9812.44s -> 9826.38s]  elven cherry wood. It took like 15 grand. When equipped the endless bag of gold increases your income by
[9826.38s -> 9836.02s]  750 a day. This bow increases your archery by five percent. What a mistake that was. That guy is
[9836.02s -> 9843.54s]  fucking dead. All right. I don't know if I want to do attack this yet and I got a boat too. So I got
[9843.54s -> 9855.72s]  money. Very important. Let me take this place over. This place. Wait what's in here? Oh boy. He's on
[9855.72s -> 9874.06s]  his way over here. This guy's dangerous. Um look at this shit. There's stuff back here. Red border
[9874.06s -> 9890.63s]  gate. There's like a troll bridge. I probably need to just get on the boat and get out of here. Let
[9890.63s -> 9894.57s]  me just go to the arena. There's nothing else down here. I'm not going to go in here.
[9896.41s -> 9909.06s]  Ding dong. That's two attack. I think I need defense. I have zero defense guys. It's very
[9909.06s -> 9920.89s]  necessary. Give me the shipyard. Mine. He's not going to be able to move. He's going to anchor up
[9920.89s -> 9931.40s]  here and he's going to be stuck. So I got an opportunity. I can leave. Why did I do that?
[9931.40s -> 9937.80s]  Because he can't move when he lands. I'm getting in there and I'm getting the gold.
[9938.44s -> 9945.61s]  Okay. Artifacts. Merchants. For a nominal fee you can purchase artifacts from the merchants.
[9946.65s -> 9957.70s]  Lookout tower. Super genies. Yeah. Upgraded genies. Master genie and recruit genies. What's the
[9957.70s -> 9970.58s]  difference? Hates effreet. Spellcaster. Random benefit. Pretty good. This is still uncontested
[9970.58s -> 9981.05s]  somehow. All right. He's gonna he's not gonna have enough points to do anything. Here he comes in
[9981.05s -> 9988.46s]  the boat again. He's going all he's going around. See he might take this castle but okay do I have
[9988.46s -> 10000.78s]  enough? He's not coming for me I don't think. I think I can get in there and get out. Where's the
[10000.78s -> 10011.13s]  boat? What happened to the boat that was right here? I can get in and get out. He summoned the
[10011.13s -> 10017.37s]  boat. Oh fuck. No I know my boat's right here but like he's he must have summoned it back.
[10023.99s -> 10028.07s]  Summon it? Should I summon it from him? No but I can get in this one. I'm going for it. Fuck it.
[10032.47s -> 10038.14s]  I can't let you pass. You should seek a key master tent. Like that? What about the troll bridge?
[10038.78s -> 10045.58s]  Much to your dismay the troll bridge is guarded by several trolls. Do you want to fight?
[10046.70s -> 10057.29s]  No. No. Go back to my like war machine factory. I'm gonna recruit more golems. No I am not going
[10057.29s -> 10069.43s]  for it. All right it's time to get another hero. Wizard or necromancer. I kind of want like a knight.
[10070.07s -> 10085.56s]  Especially hypnotize. Animate dead. Just have two necromancers? Yeah. Level three. Wait who the
[10085.56s -> 10097.94s]  fuck is this person? What? Wait. Phant? Wasn't this guy an enemy? Oh he's a deserter. He deserted.
[10100.52s -> 10110.39s]  That's so funny. He deserted and we hired him. No loyalty at all. Holy shit. All right do you think
[10110.39s -> 10117.98s]  I should just deck him out with all my money? Fuck yeah. I'm gonna spend every set of golems.
[10121.96s -> 10126.76s]  He's pretty fucking strong though. All right like we can't just have one hero.
[10126.76s -> 10139.48s]  This guy has a lot. The master genies. These are really good. I'm okay with this. No where's uh
[10139.48s -> 10151.83s]  where's he? He's got the glyph of gallantry. We're out by one. He has the first aid tent. Heals
[10151.83s -> 10160.26s]  everybody in each round. Okay what does he have for spells? Summon boat. Great. Animate dead.
[10161.48s -> 10180.94s]  Increased effect of animate dead. Okay I'm gonna keep him here for now. Let's move on. I need to
[10180.94s -> 10188.92s]  go check out the golems. Oh there he is. Did he fight? Okay he had to fight. This is empty.
[10189.72s -> 10196.49s]  Dude I don't know. I'm not doing that again. He's getting so much more money though.
[10197.13s -> 10203.06s]  I'm not gonna fall for it. He did it like the same thing to this guy.
[10203.94s -> 10207.46s]  Let him take on the trolls. Let him fight everything and then I'm gonna clean him up.
[10213.10s -> 10221.14s]  10 wood. Nice. Hold on a minute. Wait wait wait wait wait. Is there anything else over here?
[10222.02s -> 10229.96s]  Freelancer's guild. There's a bunch of stuff down here. Dwarven treasury.
[10233.83s -> 10246.22s]  Anchor up first. I got a turn. All right what do we got? Library. Uh upgraded golem factory.
[10247.62s -> 10257.42s]  Or it's time to get. Yeah this guy is gonna. This is the best unit I can make. Get him both.
[10270.74s -> 10282.89s]  This person is really ready to go. I could upgrade it too. Hopefully the person doesn't fall. Go
[10282.89s -> 10293.66s]  fight the trolls in the bridge. No. All dwellings increase population. We get a condor. 5,000. What
[10293.66s -> 10301.75s]  do we got? I can get a couple of these. I can get. Yeah let's just get the ones. Let's recruit
[10301.75s -> 10316.10s]  more golems. All right. I feel pretty safe. I'm gonna get back in that boat and I'm gonna
[10316.10s -> 10323.70s]  explore over here. I feel safe. Get more. I mean I just want to just sit here
[10324.50s -> 10342.31s]  and farm them. Farm these guys. All right let's go. Farm golems for 10 straight turns. I feel like
[10342.31s -> 10357.91s]  I'm gonna lose something. War taxes. No it's only it's per week. It's not every day. It's every week.
[10359.99s -> 10367.88s]  Sorry. Unfortunately guys. I'm gonna go exploring. I'm gonna go down here. Or should I fight the
[10367.88s -> 10394.63s]  trolls? Queens. Oh man. I can make naga queens. I can make it fully upgraded. I just can't afford
[10394.63s -> 10411.98s]  it right this second. Let's go. He's gonna be right in my way. Uncharted territory. Hold on a minute here.
[10412.46s -> 10429.30s]  Dead. Boat-to-boat combat. 28. You ain't got nothing. Get on over there. Walk the plank.
[10429.86s -> 10461.19s]  They're gonna have to do the same thing. Ow. He ran away. He wasn't gonna deal with that. He
[10461.19s -> 10481.24s]  abandoned his post. Goodbye. Cowards. Coward. So what is over here? A lot of uncharted territory.
[10481.24s -> 10488.30s]  What about up there? Should I check this? Oh there's a shipwreck. Let's check this out.
[10488.30s -> 10503.88s]  Shipwreck. Let's check it. Resource silo. Let's upgrade some stuff. This is the best thing that I can make.
[10509.24s -> 10514.22s]  I'm bringing in so many people. I'm just spending so much money. I've got so many people.
[10515.26s -> 10522.12s]  I'm going to win. The turtle wins the race. Did you see the end of that movie?
[10534.68s -> 10538.68s]  Pirate ship creaks eerily as it's pushed against rocks. Do you wish to search the shipwreck?
[10539.48s -> 10566.60s]  Yes. Morale down. Search it, yeah. Nothing in there? Whoa. Okay. I'm gonna be unstoppable.
[10574.95s -> 10589.70s]  Uh oh. Red. I haven't seen red or blue. Mermaids. Luck. Increased luck.
[10595.56s -> 10608.49s]  Anything else? Oh. Turn around. I've gotten too greedy. I thought there was shit over here.
[10609.05s -> 10626.22s]  Should I board him? Let's see what he does. I think red is the actually one to be afraid of.
[10634.42s -> 10641.35s]  No this is very heavily guarded right now. I'm going down here.
[10643.59s -> 10664.63s]  Do I have everything that I can? 99, 66, 39, 23, 24, 15, 6. Unstoppable. Could have another hero too.
[10664.63s -> 10669.75s]  Yeah I could have another hero. Um maybe I'm absolutely gonna pick like this weird frog guy.
[10670.55s -> 10683.24s]  All right who am I gonna give you? You're gonna you're gonna go off on your own adventure.
[10685.62s -> 10695.11s]  Um you don't get anybody. Have this one person farm golems. That would be
[10695.67s -> 10705.88s]  useful. All right you go off on an adventure. In fact, no I can't fit a bolt in the boat.
[10706.60s -> 10731.64s]  You gotta make your way over here. I need like two boats. Head down here. Okay let's move on.
[10736.76s -> 10743.91s]  That's where I'm going. Blue just hanging out right there. Can I see what he has?
[10744.87s -> 10747.59s]  The Freelancer's Guild. I feel like there's something good there.
[10752.06s -> 10761.69s]  Let's land. A lot of shit over here. I don't know where we got you. Let's see. What do you want to do
[10761.69s -> 10770.15s]  here? Go back. You go to the Golem Hut. We got there available. Uh we're almost at the next week.
[10770.15s -> 10779.66s]  You can take some. We also have Ewan here who I could bring you out. But should this be the
[10779.66s -> 10797.77s]  Stax Defender? Level one Alchemist or the Edamon the Burning Guy. Specialty Golems.
[10798.87s -> 10841.11s]  Specialty Golems. Should she just take a bunch? Just take the Golems? Just take them all. I mean
[10841.11s -> 10855.32s]  she is the Golem like queen. All right you take the Golems. Have fun. All right let's go. Five
[10855.32s -> 10869.67s]  gems. Witch Hut. Basic Offense. What does the specialty do? Increases the attack and defense
[10869.67s -> 10874.15s]  skills of any stone or iron Golems for each level attained after third level.
[10874.95s -> 10881.88s]  Xena. It's a frog guy. You kind of uh you're kind of like useless at this point.
[10882.76s -> 10891.37s]  Anything else to upgrade? Golem Factory. Probably should just have. I probably should have done
[10891.37s -> 10901.59s]  that before. Send her back. Waste of a turn but whatever. Oh yeah I'll put frog guy in a boat.
[10902.55s -> 10914.39s]  Send him somewhere. All right we'll do that after. Go back. Upgrade these guys. 41 iron Golems
[10916.68s -> 10921.32s]  and let's buy as many people as we can. I can leave. I got this. These are so good.
[10923.03s -> 10937.94s]  I all right I got enough Golem. No just yeah we're gonna go. I got 41 iron Golems. Here we go.
[10937.94s -> 10947.27s]  Time to start with you. We've got Shipyard. I mean do I should just buy it? Own it? Does it really
[10947.27s -> 10958.49s]  matter? We got Freelancer's Guild. Please inspect our find. Whereas if you feel like offering a trade
[10958.49s -> 10969.67s]  click on the items you wish to trade for. Oh I see. I can give you two iron Golems for one wood.
[10969.67s -> 10979.72s]  Oh get the fuck out of here. No thanks. Try and learn third level spell. Frost Ring.
[10980.60s -> 10995.53s]  Lots of holders. It's a gold mine. I think I could take them. We got uh idle fortune. Let's get it.
[10996.89s -> 11003.82s]  What about you? I want to get you shipping out here. I can't buy a boat but I will next turn.
[11004.78s -> 11033.94s]  Out of money comes taxes of course. Frost Ring. Magic Arrow is 50 points. There's a lot of them
[11033.94s -> 11063.86s]  but are they are they magic resistant? Not bad. We can take them. Oof that hurt.
[11070.38s -> 11090.82s]  Get in there. Got this. Spread them out a little bit. You go forward here. Yeah we're good. I need
[11091.06s -> 11094.42s]  I should meet that lady somewhere in the middle and transfer the golems to her.
[11095.30s -> 11112.38s]  Although there's no bonus for these golems unfortunately right?
[11113.26s -> 11130.50s]  This way. One last gremlin remains. I think that gremlin's gonna stay alive.
[11134.97s -> 11154.12s]  These things have we've gonna lose our skeleton stack I think. Although we should get some more.
[11158.79s -> 11171.59s]  Lost 29 skeletons. Ton of experience though. Ooh fourth level spells. Basic earth magic. I need
[11171.59s -> 11187.35s]  to go and learn some spells. Four gems. One a day. Good. All right let's go this way. Thousand
[11187.35s -> 11209.32s]  experience. This is this guy's capital. Purple. Not strong enough to take that yet. All right golem
[11209.32s -> 11219.32s]  lady needs to go down to golem center. Right here. We need to get wood. We need boats. I need a ton
[11219.32s -> 11231.72s]  of shit. Yeah the second city. I mean no one's coming near this. This has been untouched. Maybe
[11231.72s -> 11234.76s]  it's time to put some resources into this and actually make it. But I don't have any money,
[11234.76s -> 11241.34s]  I don't have any resources. I need wood. Can't do anything with it right now. You cannot get a boat
[11241.34s -> 11258.55s]  so I can't do anything with you. You may as well just sit here. All right gold mine. Den of thieves.
[11259.91s -> 11274.97s]  I'm actually interested in right now. Here we go. Best hero. Number of towns. Red. So red is
[11275.53s -> 11280.63s]  oh jesus wyverns. Everybody has something really strong.
[11281.43s -> 11293.96s]  I'm terrible on defense but I'm powerful in everything else. Now this dude has a legit red
[11293.96s -> 11314.52s]  dragon. Look at that face. I have the best income. Good to know. All right homestead. Purple. Let's
[11314.52s -> 11322.74s]  take all this shit away from purple. Do it next turn. Don't have enough for a boat. So you two
[11322.74s -> 11339.61s]  just gonna have to sit here. Let's go back this way. Lookout tower. A lot of knowledge. This cloud
[11339.61s -> 11353.43s]  temple. I need it's just my resources are so depleted. I'm just gonna have to keep going.
[11354.23s -> 11364.09s]  What is this on? This is just on pc. It's on windows 10. Good old games. It works perfectly
[11364.09s -> 11369.21s]  fine. There's an HD patch. You don't have to get the HD remaster. The HD remaster on steam
[11369.69s -> 11376.17s]  is unfortunately I guess doesn't have any of the expansion packs. Doesn't have any added content.
[11377.37s -> 11394.98s]  It's a thousand gold a day. Medusa stores. Homestead. Recruit wood elves. Yeah Medusa stores.
[11395.70s -> 11416.70s]  This is probably Medusa's. I don't have enough. All right it might be time to upgrade this to the
[11416.86s -> 11426.94s]  town. What are we gonna get here? Tavern for a fort. City hall. I need tavern and mage guild.
[11426.94s -> 11433.16s]  Taverns. No that's wood. Resource silo. Mage. It's all wood. I need the wood.
[11438.04s -> 11449.62s]  No not until I get a boat. Although I might as well just. I'll take 85 of these. Why not?
[11450.26s -> 11460.79s]  At least there's somebody there. Resource silo is five. Five thousand. What do I have? I have plenty.
[11460.79s -> 11467.64s]  Yeah let's build the resource silo. I can do it on both. Resource silo. Five thousand and five.
[11467.64s -> 11479.08s]  Do it again. That's plus two gems a day. Just waiting for the goddamn wood so I can get this
[11479.08s -> 11496.89s]  person in a boat and send him. How much are you? Not quite enough to get these. All right let's go.
[11497.45s -> 11506.52s]  I'm about to be at the stage where I'm gonna. Uh-oh. Oh fuck. That guy just landed.
[11510.42s -> 11521.14s]  Oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Not my two scouts. Nine.
[11522.58s -> 11547.72s]  Boat. Give me his boat. See you later motherfucker. All right. I mean I've got. I've got 47 iron
[11547.72s -> 11564.41s]  golems. I'm gonna get out of here with this lady. Stalem. He has a horde. Horde. Horde. He has like
[11564.41s -> 11573.51s]  hundreds of people. Body block him. I can't body block him. It's all right. We still have
[11573.51s -> 11588.22s]  uh Professor Thant. Guys no one's taking this castle. Not with Professor Thant. Okay what's
[11588.22s -> 11596.58s]  the Medusa stores? What happened? Oh somebody already took it. I got scared for a second. All
[11596.58s -> 11600.82s]  right let's go this way. The windmill. Already visited that. Already went to the dead thieves.
[11601.78s -> 11609.29s]  Let's go to the dwarven treasury. We found a dwarven treasury. Do you wish to attack the guards?
[11626.87s -> 11634.47s]  What? What? What'd I just do? 20% magic resist. I have an 80% chance to hit you with that.
[11638.07s -> 11653.06s]  That was bullshit. It's all right. You take this one on. Good. Look at that. That's a ton of damage.
[11654.31s -> 11663.56s]  Uh I think I'm just gonna split up into the four corners. Take the skeletons
[11664.36s -> 11678.76s]  up here. All right you. Both you guys kill this one.
[11680.44s -> 11687.56s]  Yeah you're getting counter-attacked every five seconds. Yeah you're trying to run away.
[11689.96s -> 11702.36s]  Uh who do I want to shoot at? Probably probably you. And then you uh go up and help the skeletons.
[11703.08s -> 11726.18s]  I don't care about this guy. He's gonna die. Here you just go up. Save this guy. He's fine.
[11727.74s -> 11737.34s]  He's the body blocker. He is official body blocker.
[11757.53s -> 11767.69s]  Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. A lot of dwarves here. There better be a ton of good shit in here.
[11767.69s -> 11786.89s]  I'm gonna be very upset. No get away from my archers. He's strong. All right run away. No fuck.
[11786.89s -> 11794.26s]  I thought I had the other guy selected. I had. I thought I had that this guy was selected.
[11794.82s -> 11815.70s]  I'm fine. There. See. Just kill him.
[11820.63s -> 11838.90s]  All right you got one dwarf left. Not a big deal. Costly battle. It's fine.
[11838.90s -> 11848.12s]  There it is. 2,000 experience. That's a lot. I did lose some but you know that was. There's
[11848.12s -> 11857.90s]  a hundred dwarves guys. Advanced resistance. Yes. Having defeated the battle dwarves you
[11857.90s -> 11867.37s]  discover five crystals and 5,000 gold. It's actually exactly what I needed. Here's an obelisk.
[11869.85s -> 11874.38s]  Um I don't know what to do here though. Unfortunately this is not good. This is not
[11874.38s -> 11881.05s]  good at all. Nobody else to recruit. I kind of have to run away or sacrifice myself.
[11881.85s -> 11891.85s]  I got the guy on the boat but he might just. Okay. Perfect scenario is he turns around
[11892.49s -> 11904.71s]  and is pissed that I took the boat and fights me. There's nowhere for me to go. Hide. Hide.
[11905.51s -> 11914.46s]  What is the hide? He has a full turn coming up. Bring Thant out. Should I bring Thant out and
[11914.46s -> 11946.78s]  just have him just run down here? I could do that. Are you ready for this? Let's go. Oh you're dead.
[11946.78s -> 11960.89s]  You ran right by me. All right. Obelisk. What the hell? Puzzle map. What is this? Puzzle map?
[11961.45s -> 11983.59s]  What do I do with this? I have missing pieces or. Hmm. I need all the pieces. I don't have it.
[11984.15s -> 11993.34s]  All right. We have some some shit going down. So expert. I didn't say I was an expert. I
[11993.34s -> 12002.02s]  said I'd played this when I was a young kid. I don't know if that does. All right. Uh warrior's
[12002.02s -> 12013.69s]  tomb. Let's keep going. What is this one? Haste. That's a good spell. Warrior's tomb. Mushrooms.
[12013.69s -> 12026.74s]  Let's just get a view here. Oh fuck. Uh oh. All right. This is a fight. This is a fight to end
[12026.74s -> 12037.11s]  all fights. What do you think? Is it time? Is it time to get to go nuts? I'll get a lot of
[12037.11s -> 12051.02s]  experience with this one. Here we go. Skeleton horde versus very powerful genies and very powerful
[12051.02s -> 12066.09s]  queens. Okay. We've got. Let me take a look here. Genie. Genie can move very very fluidly.
[12066.89s -> 12073.80s]  We've got bloodlust. Curse. Protection from fire. Increase the hand-to-hand damage inflicted by the
[12073.80s -> 12078.92s]  selected unit. Cause the selected enemy unit to inflict minimum damage in combat.
[12084.55s -> 12090.58s]  The spell will affect nobody. Okay. What about bloodlust? Should I give bloodlust to the genie?
[12092.47s -> 12107.69s]  Well bloodlust to the uh to the naga queens. Stone skin. How long does it last? Just for the whole
[12107.69s -> 12116.57s]  the whole thing. Bloodlust on the naga queens. We're gonna get these guys in a favorable position.
[12117.78s -> 12127.13s]  I'm gonna say like right here. Same deal. Get you guys in a favorable position.
[12133.24s -> 12144.86s]  All right. We've got the naga queens. On you up here probably. Let's get like up here.
[12149.13s -> 12158.55s]  Oh that hurts. All right. You're ranged. Nice. That does a lot. Just get you guys up there.
[12158.55s -> 12166.02s]  You're just like a shield essentially at this point. I need the mages. Who else is ranged? Nice.
[12166.02s -> 12181.35s]  Beautiful. Oh I thought that was gonna do it. Vampire. All right. Going for the queens. Genie
[12181.35s -> 12189.56s]  time. Now spell cast a random benefit. He can pretty much go anywhere in the map. I wonder if
[12189.56s -> 12194.76s]  I should just take out the lich. I think I can get the lich with the gremlins. I mean I could buff.
[12195.48s -> 12209.50s]  Cast a spell on obsidian gargoyles. Cast a spell on the naga queens. How would I get shield?
[12211.27s -> 12228.58s]  66. I'm going for a I think we'll go for the the wraiths. Oh that was easy. Trying to kill
[12228.58s -> 12233.70s]  this. Oh fuck. That was bad. All right. I'm gonna go with the queens up here. Big unit versus big
[12233.70s -> 12250.09s]  unit. Let's go. What did that do? How much did he kill? Get rid of this guy. Did one. I mean this
[12250.09s -> 12271.27s]  thing is insane. So once this is done it's it's over. Okay. I gotta play smart here. I can't
[12271.27s -> 12282.01s]  curse anybody. Maybe bloodlust on on genie. I'm gonna do more like stone skin on the naga.
[12289.62s -> 12296.14s]  Curse? I don't think I can. I can't curse anybody. I'm gonna do stone skin on
[12297.34s -> 12304.74s]  on naga. All right. We gotta we gotta focus on this dude here.
[12306.76s -> 12317.26s]  Two black knight stone. Good. This thing has to die. Genie. Should I just buff the queen again?
[12318.06s -> 12322.89s]  Should we just buff the fuck out of the queens? I think I can kill it.
[12325.94s -> 12333.35s]  Yes. All right. We're good. 62 versus uh with 10. Five. It's in the bag.
[12338.89s -> 12351.02s]  Yeah this is the bag. I ain't got nothing. I win. Ran away. I lost. Not very much.
[12354.55s -> 12364.70s]  Level four. Advanced wisdom. Fourth level spells or basic water magic. It's a good thing I had this
[12364.70s -> 12381.40s]  guy. Let's do water magic. All right. Cool. All right. Back to bed. That's all I wanted you to do.
[12381.40s -> 12387.80s]  I wanted to go get more minions. You on the other hand. Uh there's a boat there now. I have a scout.
[12391.05s -> 12397.67s]  I can do two boats. Not yet. You need to go exploring.
[12405.96s -> 12418.20s]  Just search. Yes. Nothing there. Got nothing in there.
[12423.43s -> 12432.60s]  You have you got a lot of stuff too. Make another boat. I think I'm gonna do two boats here. Yeah.
[12432.60s -> 12449.06s]  Let's go. Let's get in there. Opportunity down here. Middle thing in the castle. I can do the
[12449.06s -> 12459.35s]  trolls maybe. How are we doing on resources? Wall of knowledge. How much is this? Five and a
[12459.35s -> 12465.11s]  thousand. Yeah. Just build it. Let's go. Plus one knowledge. Anybody that goes in. I've got able to
[12465.11s -> 12480.66s]  recruit. All right. Let's go. Uh oh. I'm on the defensive now. Who came in? Oh shit. It's purple.
[12483.29s -> 12496.25s]  Who did you attack? Oh I'm down there. I don't. This is bad. You've got unicorns. Shit. This is
[12496.25s -> 12512.17s]  not good. This is this is a losing battle. 100. It's the same guy with the 100 plus centaurs. Um
[12512.97s -> 12537.62s]  but I could probably take a few people out and then run away. This is so many crystal things to
[12537.62s -> 12557.88s]  lose. Oh no. Wait. What does surrender do? What's the difference? I'm just gonna. I mean I'm just
[12557.88s -> 12574.84s]  gonna. I bet. Apparently I'm just gonna run. Here we go. Surrender lets you keep your army for a
[12574.84s -> 12580.25s]  price. Oh no. Fuck that. Thankfully this guy doesn't have the whole army.
[12587.88s -> 12602.47s]  I lose badly in both scenarios. How much is it to surrender? I wonder like what do I have to pay?
[12603.43s -> 12638.28s]  Coward. But at least I keep the artifacts. He's back. I had a lot of artifacts on that guy. I'm
[12638.28s -> 12655.88s]  gonna lose him. We're good. Okay. Now you. Well this is our new main anyways. One knowledge.
[12670.52s -> 12685.94s]  Give me your shit. Come outside please. All right. Level eight versus level four.
[12688.57s -> 12692.49s]  I mean I guess we could. He's level eight. Should I just give him everything?
[12695.35s -> 12705.38s]  Maybe I'll just give him everything because he's level eight. Ballista. I can only have one.
[12705.38s -> 12714.87s]  Ballista. I can do the ten. This is a glyph of gallantry. Mara by one or health of all units.
[12714.87s -> 12741.38s]  No that's way better. Okay. Fant has better. I'm gonna keep Fant on defense. In fact I want to
[12742.10s -> 12752.22s]  Okay. You've already visited. I gotta get something else here though. Oh yeah the gold.
[12752.22s -> 12761.42s]  Gold. Gold. Give me the bag. Switch the bag. That'll be forever protected. Oh I can actually take
[12761.42s -> 12770.63s]  this. Because now I gave him the bag of gold. Very nice. Very nice. So Fant. Get back in here.
[12771.51s -> 12785.62s]  It is your job. I think I have to move you. He is the one that will defend this castle. Get in here.
[12786.42s -> 12809.30s]  Summon boat. Dispel. Slow. Stone skin. Um can I learn any of these? I have to upgrade it. Yeah
[12809.30s -> 12815.74s]  it's level one. What is that? Thousand. It just costs resources. All right. We'll switch it out.
[12815.74s -> 12820.84s]  We have. You have a lot of good people now. You're forced to be reckoned with completely.
[12824.90s -> 12829.14s]  Uh I'm looking. Hopefully I can recruit something. I could get some more golems.
[12829.22s -> 12841.96s]  All right. I'm going back down. All right. We got boats. You have 47 golems. I wonder if I can
[12841.96s -> 12847.82s]  fight the trolls with these. I'm kind of scared to do that. Yeah what is Nimbus's specialty? That's
[12847.82s -> 12854.04s]  a good question. Specialty is eagle eye. She's five percent per level bonus to eagle eye skill
[12854.04s -> 12862.15s]  percentage. What about you? What's your specialty? Eagle eye again. This dude sucks. This dude's only
[12862.15s -> 12865.94s]  purpose is to like walk around and look at stuff. Nobody even here.
[12869.64s -> 12879.56s]  Claim that castle. It's mine. You are gonna go. Who's over here? You a shipyard. Avoid that. Go
[12879.56s -> 12887.94s]  down here. You know what I'm saying? Like up this way maybe. Or down here. Let's go down here.
[12890.18s -> 12907.10s]  He's taking everything back. Wood elf growth plus five dwellings increase population.
[12907.90s -> 12915.58s]  Damn it. I'm so annoyed. Right at the last day they came back.
[12919.02s -> 12932.09s]  That sucks. Why does this guy always pre-record his screams? It's just easier that way. I actually
[12934.14s -> 12942.25s]  weirdly enough. We can bring this up now. I'm actually like 52 years old. By the time you're
[12942.25s -> 12949.96s]  seeing this. I've recorded like eight or nine thousand like six hour sessions and I batch
[12949.96s -> 12957.19s]  uploaded all of them and they're all scheduled to go. I'm actually like 50. I've been doing this. I
[12957.19s -> 12962.94s]  did this like I don't know maybe 30 like 20 years ago or so. It's kind of I guess that kind of they
[12962.94s -> 12976.14s]  can come out. Sirens. What did that say? A bunch of people dove out of a bunch of people drowned
[12976.14s -> 12999.64s]  themselves. That's great. I lost half my army. That sucks. Let's go with plus two attack. I don't
[12999.64s -> 13005.14s]  get in there so bad and I can't do anything about that either. No this dude's gonna have to go
[13005.14s -> 13021.88s]  explore over on this side. They're already showing these to me. Castle ship. Go take it. I don't think
[13021.88s -> 13036.01s]  I can. I have like 40 frogs. I don't think they're gonna be good enough. Yeah they have much better
[13036.01s -> 13056.76s]  units that I do. I'll just get down here. I think I can handle this up here now. Yeah I can handle
[13056.76s -> 13074.84s]  this. I'm going up here. That's a gold mine. That's a mercenary camp. Let's go for it. War machine
[13074.84s -> 13080.92s]  factory. I already have one of these. Lots of harpy hags. That will be the next thing I do.
[13081.80s -> 13100.60s]  Speaking of doing. Level two. Remove obstacle lightning bolt. Disrupting ray and fortune.
[13101.56s -> 13132.28s]  Cool. Other town. I don't have enough money. Let's go. All the purple is over here on the right side.
[13132.76s -> 13143.56s]  There's the fucking taxes again. Goose eggs. Zero everywhere. What do you guys have? Pack several
[13143.56s -> 13161.24s]  lots. Pack. I could kill this one. I do have a lot of gems. Gotta have a lot of gem. I have more gem
[13162.20s -> 13166.18s]  buildings than I have anything else. All right you just keep going over here.
[13172.22s -> 13185.83s]  Damn it. All right harpy hags. Do not engage. They're afraid. Touch the obelisk. Puzzle map.
[13185.83s -> 13198.92s]  Don't have them all unfortunately. Lots of captains. Centaur captains. I wonder if I can do it.
[13199.64s -> 13212.18s]  Don't engage. They're afraid. Recruit stone gargoyles. How many do I have? No I don't want that.
[13213.08s -> 13216.92s]  Now this is where it's going to get hard. These are absolutely going to attack me.
[13217.56s -> 13232.14s]  Morale increased. Lots of silver. Pegas high. They scatter. I'm so powerful. A thousand more a day.
[13233.02s -> 13235.58s]  Nice. Awesome. And I'll go to the mercenary camp up here and get all this stuff.
[13236.22s -> 13243.22s]  Now what the hell am I going to do with you? I'm just going to put you. This is just a scout.
[13243.94s -> 13257.98s]  Head this way. I mean he's definitely, he's dead. He's dead.
[13258.06s -> 13280.62s]  Uh oh. They got a bone dragon. Time to die. Four. You killed fucking 33. 25 to 50 damage.
[13283.96s -> 13305.98s]  That's insane. Let's go this way. Ow. Hey you. Get that motherfucker out of here.
[13306.54s -> 13318.86s]  Lots of, they're going to run away too. All right. Look at all this shit up here. We got mercenary camp.
[13319.74s -> 13327.34s]  Plus one attack. A thousand experience. Expert resistance. That's huge.
[13328.23s -> 13334.33s]  20 magic resistance. A thousand gold or 500 experience. We're going to do the experience
[13334.33s -> 13352.41s]  I think. Both of them. 1500 experience. Level 10. Expert wisdom. Basic learning.
[13353.93s -> 13359.77s]  That seems like the expert wisdom or basic learning.
[13364.68s -> 13371.14s]  Are they the same kind of thing? Level fifth level spells. I got to go back and do this.
[13373.54s -> 13380.94s]  Expert wisdom. Wisdom and learning. High wisdom, low intelligence.
[13382.46s -> 13388.97s]  Should I be, should I learn? No, that's just experience. But
[13390.79s -> 13396.86s]  all right. We're going to do the basic learning. All right. I've cleaned this out.
[13396.94s -> 13405.98s]  This guy's pretty strong now. My only concern is now with the unguarded couple of places here is
[13406.62s -> 13418.09s]  someone's going to be coming here. You just landed. What do you got? That's not good. Purple is going
[13418.09s -> 13423.37s]  to be coming up this way. I have to bring you back to the castle. You can just go like Magellan this
[13423.37s -> 13443.91s]  way. There's nothing over here. Don't even tell me there's nothing here. Artifact merchant. Library.
[13443.91s -> 13450.98s]  Lookout tower. I can do that. No, that's 10,000. Let's just recruit some people. I'm going to spend
[13450.98s -> 13465.03s]  the money. Just in case for some reason he gets here. Let's go. Depends on what Purple's going to
[13465.03s -> 13478.87s]  do. Oh no. He got it. Did he just go in the boat? He's taking everything. What am I doing out here?
[13478.87s -> 13494.09s]  There's nothing even out. This just rocks. Oh shit. Holy crap. This just rocks and shit.
[13494.90s -> 13506.52s]  He took all my stuff. Where are you? Throng Horde Horde Swarm Horde Pack. Is this a fight?
[13507.16s -> 13517.53s]  I mean this must be like 300. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is going to be a battle at the castle,
[13517.53s -> 13533.18s]  I think. I'm not going to be able to make it back. I'm not going to be able to make it back in time.
[13542.41s -> 13545.37s]  No, we're okay. This is a pretty decent defense.
[13572.95s -> 13596.90s]  See what happens. Thank God. What an idiot. Yes. Oh, he didn't do anything. He just turned around.
[13597.30s -> 13612.04s]  He got scared. Come on. I have to wait another turn to do this? Give me my stuff back. It's mine,
[13612.04s -> 13619.18s]  not yours. I just ruined everything. I just fucking ruined everything. He can kill me now
[13619.18s -> 13623.85s]  because of a goddamn gold mine or a gem mine. Whatever the hell it was. I'm dead.
[13624.90s -> 13635.83s]  If he decides to turn around and attack me, I'm dead. Oh, thank God he went the other way.
[13636.71s -> 13639.27s]  I'm excited about this though. This is completely uncharted territory.
[13644.34s -> 13660.33s]  Whoa, this is a dragon utopia. You stand before the dragon utopia, a place off limits to mere
[13660.33s -> 13671.11s]  humans. Do you wish to violate this rule and challenge the dragons to a fight? I don't think
[13671.11s -> 13684.14s]  I do, but that's cool that it's down here. I could probably recruit like next level dragons down here.
[13687.74s -> 13706.10s]  Save scum it and just see what it is. I couldn't go back in. The cursor wouldn't let me do it
[13706.90s -> 13713.19s]  because I was already standing on the space. I was standing on the one spot where I was
[13713.19s -> 13724.60s]  allowed to do it, so I had to move. Let's do it again. I already learned that. I already learned
[13724.60s -> 13741.88s]  that. Let's go. I'm actually not afraid anymore. He already cleaned this all out. I feel like,
[13741.88s -> 13747.30s]  no, I'm going to go back and I'm going to keep, I'm going to recruit more. Yeah,
[13748.02s -> 13764.46s]  I'm going to take all these guys because I want to be unbeatable over here. All right, I need
[13764.46s -> 13783.61s]  a, I need 20 wood. What is this? Five wood? It's not worth it. I need the wood. City hall. I need mage
[13783.61s -> 13795.19s]  and yeah, but I just, I'm going to burn all my wood. Whatever. Nobody claims this.
[13799.67s -> 13818.97s]  Yeah, tax day is coming up. You're right. Well, you're just stuck down here now. I was,
[13820.62s -> 13824.14s]  I just forgot. I was supposed to just go look in there, but I saved it. It don't matter.
[13824.86s -> 13831.66s]  I, I'm all right. Whatever. If I like, okay, if I went in there and I died,
[13831.66s -> 13837.59s]  I would have had to do like that whole last turn again. I don't know. Whatever. It don't matter.
[13837.59s -> 13860.57s]  Like do you really want me to like redo the last whole turn? There's no way I'm doing this.
[13869.10s -> 13881.64s]  Well, it's every kind of dragon. What do they have stats? 40 to 50, 40. No, you've got to come in
[13881.64s -> 13900.30s]  here with like a hundred at least dead. Well, there it is. That's a cool little thing though.
[13900.30s -> 13904.60s]  That's an interesting little like secret. All right. I was going to go up here.
[13905.32s -> 13913.43s]  I was going to do this. I want more minions and then I'm taking you on a boat and we're going
[13913.43s -> 13917.19s]  to try to kill somebody. I'm going to try to wipe somebody up. Just coming up this turn coming up.
[13919.61s -> 13936.07s]  All right. No, it was this one over here. Tavern. You have made us very pleased. Good.
[13936.07s -> 13944.71s]  Now you have to just get out of here. You just, oh, I hate that. I have to do this shit.
[13945.67s -> 13969.10s]  All right. I want mage tower level three. I need six pots. I can get that right now.
[13969.10s -> 13977.90s]  Learn spells. Level three. What else we got? We got air shield, destroy undead, force field.
[13978.54s -> 14002.49s]  Let's bring them in and we're going to look at this. So many. So many. I don't know. Should
[14002.49s -> 14011.64s]  I take them all? I'll be unstoppable. All right. Let's learn a spell. So destroy undead. Attempts
[14011.64s -> 14019.83s]  to destroy any undead creatures in the battlefield. Force field. Place a small force field on the
[14019.83s -> 14026.39s]  battlefield at a point specified by the caster. Destroy undead sounds really good. Shield is a
[14026.39s -> 14029.99s]  selected unit reducing the amount of damage received from ranged attacks. That's really good
[14029.99s -> 14050.89s]  too. Maybe destroy undead. So now how do I put a spell on? I'm curious because how do I get it on
[14050.89s -> 14063.80s]  here? Right click? Or being like the book? Or do I just do what is good? Oh, you auto learn them.
[14063.80s -> 14071.43s]  Okay. That makes sense. Let's, let me just make sure. All right. Cool. So you just get them all.
[14073.93s -> 14078.41s]  All right. Uh, we're at the end of the week. I'm going to wait. I'm going to recruit and then I'm,
[14078.41s -> 14082.09s]  this is the character that is, Nimbus is going to kill everyone. I'm going to take them
[14082.09s -> 14091.40s]  on a journey to wipe out every opponent. I've upgraded all my dudes. I'm ready for a fucking
[14091.40s -> 14099.93s]  bloodbath. Anything else I can get up here that has been taken from me? Let's go to the windmill.
[14099.93s -> 14111.30s]  Just three, six crystals. Might as well take it. All right. I'm good like this. Uh, I guess I could.
[14111.94s -> 14131.08s]  I need, no, I don't have any resources for it. Let's go. Here comes a new week. All dwellings
[14131.08s -> 14138.39s]  increase population. Unfortunately, you're just stuck back here for an undetermined amount of time.
[14140.06s -> 14157.00s]  All right. Money. Recruit everyone. I am now a real ruler. I've got a lot of people.
[14157.80s -> 14163.93s]  A very scary amount. I have very highly skilled people. I don't know if I want the skeletons.
[14169.24s -> 14181.59s]  18 queens. All right. I need 20 wood. I have to do the mage guild and then the city hall.
[14185.66s -> 14199.59s]  All right. I can't do it yet, but I am ready. The question is, should I, hmm, should I take
[14199.59s -> 14208.86s]  this fucking place over? It's mine. Get it. Take it from orange. Go take all this stuff and then
[14208.86s -> 14217.24s]  summon a boat down here. I think I could take this. I think I could kill them both and then take a
[14217.24s -> 14228.57s]  boat. It's either that or the other scenario is I could go here. All right. So run down here.
[14229.29s -> 14237.14s]  Go try to kill the dragons. Oh, that's so scary. If I go kill the dragons, I have nobody available
[14237.70s -> 14254.31s]  to defend my only remaining two structures. The troll bridge. Yeah. But then you'll have dragons.
[14254.31s -> 14260.78s]  Yeah. I need to build up defenses too. I've got to go like wipe somebody. I've got to go kill
[14260.78s -> 14275.37s]  somebody. I've got to get up here. He's like right here. I could take this. Take this. Kill him.
[14278.04s -> 14282.89s]  Go to the troll bridge. Let's just wait. I got to get this guy on a boat anyway. So let's get in a
[14282.89s -> 14303.50s]  boat. All right. Let's go. Blue is not sure what he wants to do. There's the taxes. Didn't have
[14303.50s -> 14312.76s]  anything anyways. So far away. It just takes forever for you to get over here. Okay. How many points?
[14312.76s -> 14325.75s]  I got 100 points. I could go to the golem factory, which there are. Who should I get?
[14326.63s -> 14341.99s]  What do you think? Two diamond or three gold? Why not both? I don't have enough room for both.
[14341.99s -> 14346.49s]  I don't. Yeah. I only have one slot. Diamond? Yeah. Diamond's probably better.
[14352.26s -> 14355.70s]  Gold's more cost effective, but diamond is almost unheard of from spells.
[14358.06s -> 14368.81s]  Oh boy. This is iron, right? Okay. Pretty good group. Let's see if I can summon a boat.
[14369.53s -> 14374.28s]  Well, you have a boat. Should I just trade? You want to trade boats?
[14375.00s -> 14401.67s]  Just. Boy, they've been so fucked with wood this whole game. Uh oh. You going to the dragon?
[14403.58s -> 14405.82s]  This guy's heading to like the dragon's den.
[14410.47s -> 14427.45s]  I got to get away from you. Nobody in here. Well, I don't think I can fight you
[14429.93s -> 14436.94s]  although you don't really have anything that scary. We have packs small. No. He's going to
[14436.94s -> 14445.86s]  go die to the dragons. Let me see if I can get a boat here because there's a couple of boats.
[14446.58s -> 14458.01s]  Summoned boat. Do you not have summoned boat? Fuck. You don't have summoned boat.
[14468.38s -> 14480.84s]  Well, I'm just going to have to wait till you bring it up here. I clicked the wrong button.
[14486.76s -> 14515.05s]  Oh, there it is. Did I get it? How do I cast it? Not from the inventory. I can't just. I have to.
[14515.05s -> 14519.37s]  That's not. That is not the spell book. I thought it was failed to summon a boat.
[14520.17s -> 14527.99s]  I thought I could do it from both places. Uh, I, is this even possible? I, I,
[14528.87s -> 14531.27s]  is there even a friendly boat? This is why I have one friend. Let me go.
[14532.09s -> 14539.85s]  There are no boats to some and I just wasted fucking points. Just bring it over here.
[14544.25s -> 14550.17s]  He's going to the dragon. He's going to die. He's actually going to die. He has no idea.
[14554.66s -> 14575.27s]  Switch the boat. Come here. Oh, damn it. No, I was right there. No. Oh, fuck. I, oh, whatever.
[14575.27s -> 14597.77s]  Get to do another turn anyways. Oh, you're dead. You're dead. You're dead. We're going to do the
[14597.77s -> 14604.81s]  old switcheroo. Watch this. Put him in this boat. You think it's this person in the boat.
[14606.84s -> 14621.59s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me all your stuff. What do you have? All right. Now you go on the
[14621.59s -> 14625.69s]  boat and he's going to attack the boat and be like, holy shit. This guy's unbeatable pack. Lots
[14625.69s -> 14634.90s]  thrown. He's got dragons. He has bucket red dragons, but he only has packs of the other ones.
[14646.15s -> 14653.53s]  Wait for him on land. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do because this is like,
[14653.53s -> 14673.38s]  I could die to save it. I'm just going to go in the boat. He's not, he's going to avoid me.
[14674.79s -> 14681.96s]  Look, this lady's, he's not going to attack. But what if he does? I can't attack him from here.
[14682.60s -> 14693.48s]  He actually is going to the dragon. He doesn't have enough to do that.
[14701.11s -> 14711.05s]  So make sure he doesn't get them. In fact, here, do you want to take these?
[14713.72s -> 14719.46s]  Take these. I just got some more of them. You can have them. Oh, no, no, no. I got them. No,
[14719.46s -> 14751.06s]  nevermind. What do you think? Should I fight it? Should I go for it? Okay. Who is priority here?
[14758.36s -> 14762.62s]  14. That's not that big of a deal. I think that's the only range unit they have.
[14763.42s -> 14768.46s]  180 health. Jesus. This is the one that's going to be the horrible, horrible, horrible problem.
[14769.34s -> 14789.42s]  I don't have curse frost ring lightning bolt 135. Oh my God. I can lightning bolt the dragon
[14798.12s -> 14806.04s]  dragon immune immune to spells one through three. That's horrible. Lightning bolt the centaurs.
[14806.76s -> 14816.54s]  I'm going to lightning bolt the centaurs. I think see if I can kill like 30 of them.
[14819.26s -> 14824.47s]  That's not 30 of them. That's not 30 of them. That was like seven.
[14824.47s -> 14832.57s]  The genie. Who should I buff? I'm going to buff somebody with the genie. Who should I buff?
[14833.29s -> 14845.00s]  Who should be buffed? Um, somebody with range probably. Fire shield. All right.
[14845.80s -> 14863.29s]  Nobody move. Nobody move. Where should I throw this at? Probably the ranged. Get rid of the ranged.
[14863.85s -> 14870.20s]  Ranged. The ranged is gone. Okay. Now I just have to worry about the pegasus and shit.
[14871.16s -> 14880.26s]  All right. You're expendable. Get on the plank. You are also expendable. You go. Oh,
[14880.26s -> 14885.70s]  you should have gone on the other plank. It's just the golems. They're supposed to be doing this.
[14890.42s -> 14901.80s]  Morale going down. Here we go. What does the dragon just fell over and died?
[14902.44s -> 14912.94s]  All right. Here come. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, please. Shit. You suck. Oh no. Oh no.
[14912.94s -> 14918.30s]  I think we're good. We're fine. Genie. Who? What's the genie doing? I need to the dragon
[14918.30s -> 14932.41s]  to just sit back here. Uh, kill the dragon. Buff the naga. Frenzy. Oh, how many just died?
[14937.05s -> 14947.40s]  Twelve. No, it's fine. I thought that was 103 died. Just kill the dragon. Holy shit,
[14947.40s -> 14964.74s]  he was pathetic. That was wicked easy. This is the scary part. Oh no, it's not scary at all. I'm
[14964.74s -> 14986.87s]  fucking unbeatable. Unstoppable. Nobody can beat me. It's game over. Doesn't matter. I win.
[14990.39s -> 15007.37s]  4000 experience. You learned ice bolt. Basic sorcery. 5% more damage. I like it. We're good
[15007.37s -> 15016.84s]  to go. Didn't lose very much. I'm going to go sack their kingdom now. Here we go. Is that, oh,
[15016.84s -> 15033.69s]  yeah. Is that red? Oh, you got some, you got some shit over here, don't you? Where do I want to go?
[15034.49s -> 15048.26s]  What's the destination? I wonder. I could kill this. I could go here and clean up this hole.
[15048.26s -> 15056.38s]  I'm going here. Fight the dragons. Um, I'm actually, yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to do,
[15056.38s -> 15063.80s]  I'm going to change this up a little bit here. I don't, I want to get rid of, um, this. I'm not
[15063.80s -> 15071.70s]  going to, uh, I kind of, Nimbus is not going to die. Nimbus is going to be fine because I want
[15071.70s -> 15082.98s]  skeletons. Yeah, I can, I can, let me, let me just transfer and hold on. Come here. Skeletons are
[15082.98s -> 15102.90s]  actually really important. I need a space for them. Okay. I'm ready. Let's go kill the trolls.
[15103.86s -> 15112.70s]  I have a lot of money too. Let's not forget that I should probably be buying things.
[15113.42s -> 15116.76s]  Level four, I don't have any pots, but what about over here?
[15117.56s -> 15129.66s]  Mage go level one. That is required for the city hall. I could just, I could take these and upgrade
[15129.66s -> 15150.63s]  them too. All right. City hall is next. Did he die? I don't think he went in. He didn't go in yet.
[15151.43s -> 15163.83s]  Here we go. Who is here? Trolls. Should I just, is there a reason for me to do this?
[15163.83s -> 15184.94s]  I don't think there's a reason for me to fight this. Well, I'm going to buff the wizards. Slow.
[15185.66s -> 15220.62s]  See? Oh wait, I can, no, I don't, I don't want them though. Damn it. Ah, that's too bad. No,
[15220.62s -> 15227.46s]  I don't want them. Wasn't even worth hiring. I have 80 points now. All right. Let's go claim
[15227.46s -> 15234.17s]  this shit. I'm going to take it. There's a, just this one, there's a bug in here.
[15235.61s -> 15249.21s]  There's a single bug. You can just, oh, am I going to have you do? I don't know. Go defend the other
[15249.21s -> 15261.85s]  one. Go defend this one. Let's go back here and learn some spells and shit. City hall. That's more
[15261.85s -> 15271.48s]  money. I could spend some of this money too. Yeah. She can bring the, she can be the goblin transfer.
[15271.48s -> 15277.08s]  Did that guy even go in there? I think he chickened out. Gold dragon growth plus five
[15277.80s -> 15301.32s]  new week. All right, here we go. Take this castle. 17 bugs. Just get the fuck in there. Thank you.
[15301.96s -> 15313.13s]  Lost a couple of gnomes, but that's fine. Mine. Excellent. Okay. We're going to get a hero here to
[15313.13s -> 15325.14s]  defend and then I'm going to recruit all these people. Pretty sick. That's decent. That's pretty
[15325.14s -> 15338.31s]  decent defense. And we've got level three death knight. Uh, I, yeah. Why can I not recruit you?
[15338.31s -> 15352.34s]  It's because I'm in the way. Call of Valhalla. Let me, let me move out of the way.
[15352.90s -> 15370.28s]  There we go. I've got a good defense here now. We got, uh, let's see. Yep. This is good. I'm going to
[15371.24s -> 15382.47s]  escape town, flee from defending upgrade cliff nest, Thunderbirds. The specialty is
[15384.04s -> 15391.11s]  liches. I don't think I have access to them in here though. Not yet. Cyclops, behemoth, ogre,
[15393.75s -> 15403.24s]  orc tower. I can make more chieftains. Yeah. Let's get it. So upgrade these two chieftains
[15403.96s -> 15425.53s]  two to five, two to five. It's arranged as well. That's good. And you stay there. I do have a pretty
[15425.53s -> 15435.08s]  good supply of these things. Fort requires, uh, let's do, I don't think, no, I can't do it yet.
[15435.72s -> 15454.54s]  I don't, I capital needs. I just need a bunch of fucking ore. What is it to make the, um, I need a
[15454.54s -> 15466.22s]  fort. No, I'm kind of behind. All right. I have secured island in the middle. I'm ready to get in
[15466.22s -> 15475.91s]  the boat. This is protected. I don't have a problem here. I'm ready to keep going. You are on your way
[15475.91s -> 15487.53s]  to this castle over here. Don't stop. Thank you. Isn't there somebody? Okay. You're still in here.
[15487.53s -> 15509.37s]  This castle is now also defended and protected completely in a good spot. Taxes. You headed here.
[15509.37s -> 15536.09s]  Get the, this way. You're good. Cloud temple. I need this. I've just, give me more wood. Come here.
[15536.09s -> 15542.38s]  All right. Here's my thought process here. Yeah. I'm going to wipe this up. Purple's done. This is
[15542.38s -> 15552.79s]  purple's base. It's over. I'm claiming this land. You're about to lose. I'm about to take over purple.
[15552.79s -> 15569.08s]  Can't do anything else. Everything is fortified. Yeah, you're running. We just came out. Okay.
[15569.96s -> 15575.37s]  I'm not concerned at all, but I am going to save it because, you know, why not?
[15576.09s -> 15591.51s]  We've already seen this. I will take that. Thank you. It's a one a day. I'm going right on your
[15591.51s -> 15624.06s]  front door. Take the castle. Okay. They've got the unicorns. They've got not very, this is not that
[15624.06s -> 15632.14s]  bad. It's just a question of getting rid of these. Destroy undead. Don't have any undead.
[15633.03s -> 15641.91s]  Air shield. I feel like I could give this to somebody or maybe I should just blood lust
[15644.42s -> 15664.20s]  lightning bolt, ice bolt, force field, lightning bolt. I wonder if I should just lightning bolt
[15664.20s -> 15678.33s]  the archers here. Just see what it does. It's pretty good. I'm going to buff. Who do I want
[15678.33s -> 15684.98s]  to buff here? Probably the one of the ranged, probably like the mage or the, yeah, the mage,
[15684.98s -> 15698.55s]  I think prayer. Okay. The gargoyles can get in. I can get in for the gargoyle. I wonder if I should
[15698.55s -> 15709.35s]  get in. Not right now. What I'm saying, like jump over in a minute, get in, hit and get out.
[15709.91s -> 15727.48s]  I wonder if it's something I should do. I'm going to try it. Mages. Holy shit. That was devastating.
[15728.04s -> 15739.91s]  I cannot get in with the naga. So I'm just going to hold. They so desperately want to get review.
[15740.47s -> 15746.92s]  Nobody else can do anything. I'm going to put people up in front though.
[15749.58s -> 15755.34s]  Skeletons just get up here and just take damage. Can I come out the front door?
[15756.22s -> 15768.95s]  They're coming out. He's coming out the front door. Brave. I did not expect that. I thought
[15768.95s -> 15772.87s]  they were going to stay in the walls. They're coming outside. Okay. This just got a little
[15772.87s -> 15787.93s]  more hairy. I'm staying with Clint. Okay. Now I'm going to buff the naga. Buff naga. Okay.
[15787.93s -> 15812.30s]  Naga is buffed. Now I'm going in. Fuck it. Let's go. Got it. Okay. Dwarves, I think. Yeah.
[15812.30s -> 15821.10s]  This is, these are so powerful when you have a stack of them. Let's see if I can wipe this out.
[15829.75s -> 15836.63s]  Holy shit. That was insane. I can't get cocky though because all it takes is
[15840.65s -> 15846.94s]  thousand damage. Good. I'm sticking. I'm going to, I'm going to just, I don't know.
[15847.74s -> 15856.94s]  I kind of have to just, just fight it. It's in front of you. I'm going to lose all the gremlins.
[15860.44s -> 15873.96s]  Reinforce. Wow. These guys are so strong. Okay. Here come the centaurs.
[15876.12s -> 15906.62s]  Good to go again. Not good. Holy fuck.
[15912.65s -> 15921.82s]  I can taste victory. I can smell it. There's only a few things left. I'm going to get the castle.
[15923.05s -> 15930.60s]  Purple is no more. I can't go anywhere. So I'm just going to hang out right here.
[15931.48s -> 15939.67s]  This thing is very strong. Oh, I think it's like stone skin.
[15941.48s -> 15952.74s]  Don't want to lose any more of you. Yeah. Having this many. These, these are, they're upgraded too.
[15953.70s -> 15967.83s]  Can I go for a one hit kill? What do you think? Oh, no, that was a bad idea.
[15968.63s -> 15977.22s]  Oh, that was a really bad idea. That was a bad, bad idea. This thing is so strong. It's okay.
[15977.22s -> 16011.18s]  It's almost done. Kill it. Why are you so strong? No. The siege.
[16018.49s -> 16033.70s]  The battle has been won. Almost 10,000 experience. Lost 165 gremlins, 73 gargoyles, 10 magicians,
[16033.70s -> 16047.67s]  eight genies, two naga queens, seven skeletons. You have captured an enemy artifact, the tome
[16047.67s -> 16053.51s]  of earth magic. This heavy book contains all spells in the school of earth magic.
[16054.15s -> 16063.13s]  It must be equipped for those spells to be available. Expert wisdom or advanced sorcery.
[16067.40s -> 16081.03s]  Level spells, 10% more damage. Get to go again. Knowledge plus one, advanced logistics,
[16081.91s -> 16092.30s]  20% more movement speed. Damn. Advanced offense, all hand to hand by 20% more damage.
[16095.30s -> 16111.30s]  Claimed. Mara Shen. Look at this place. Thank you. I appreciate it. We're decking this place out.
[16111.86s -> 16123.94s]  You already have a castle. You don't have a capital yet. Wait, do we have a capital?
[16123.94s -> 16131.56s]  Is this thing already, what's this? Mystic pond. Produce a small random number of resources every
[16131.56s -> 16153.96s]  week. Yeah, give it to me. I need to get in there. No recruits left. So there's green dragon that's
[16153.96s -> 16160.36s]  available soon. I'm gonna have you defend here for a little bit because I mean I just did this.
[16164.34s -> 16174.14s]  Purple probably has one more stronghold that's down here. How many skeletons did I get for that?
[16176.95s -> 16187.85s]  85 skeletons. That's a lot. I'm not confident with this group though because I just lost so many.
[16193.29s -> 16197.45s]  Maybe hire a new hero to take care of this place. I have a lot of just strongholds.
[16199.29s -> 16219.91s]  I have to click on this one. You stay here. I want to have somebody available in each base.
[16221.27s -> 16232.76s]  Here's the book. Where can the book go? The book has to replace something.
[16233.56s -> 16247.02s]  Wait, does it? Yeah, it does. Okay, so you got this bone cruiser archery skill by 5%.
[16247.98s -> 16251.90s]  That's nothing. Bang. We now know every single earth spell in the game.
[16252.86s -> 16265.62s]  I want to know what they look like. Oh my god. What? Allow you to summon earth elementals. Once
[16265.62s -> 16275.77s]  cast, no other elemental may be summoned. This almost feels like hacks. Cheat codes. Implosion.
[16276.33s -> 16285.69s]  It inflicts massive damage to a single creature stack. Meteor shower. Resurrection. This is insane.
[16285.69s -> 16299.29s]  Sorrow. Well, I think that's our... I think we win. I need to get some more here. I gotta get more
[16299.29s -> 16307.48s]  units here. That was a major victory, but we suffered major losses. Let's continue the
[16307.48s -> 16312.71s]  exploration down here. How much money do I got? Can I do anything? I need to get these goddamn
[16313.59s -> 16338.55s]  giants. 10, 10, 10. I'm gonna be getting a lot of income though. I could trade the gems. Yeah,
[16338.55s -> 16361.03s]  I could, but that's not very much. I guess it is. Gems for wood. 10, 20 gems. Let's get more. 10
[16361.03s -> 16388.17s]  more. So I have... no, hold on. So that means 24 wood. I need 10 ore, which I don't have.
[16388.97s -> 16402.97s]  I have four. I have six. All right, let's get those fucking giants.
[16408.49s -> 16425.74s]  Giants. 150 health, 40 to 60 damage. Oh, I need gems to recruit. I can only recruit one a week.
[16429.10s -> 16444.01s]  Well, time to start the collection of two per week. Let me take a look at them again. Mind spell
[16444.01s -> 16450.55s]  immunity. They're very, very expensive. All right, I don't need them this second. I just want to make
[16450.55s -> 16456.30s]  sure I could get them. That leaves us with... I have 14 wood, which is enough. What's something
[16456.30s -> 16473.62s]  else I want to do? No, what was the other thing I wanted to do before I left? Upgrade the cliff
[16473.62s -> 16487.29s]  nest. I need... what do I need for this? Five more ore, which I have. Five... what do I miss in here?
[16491.74s -> 16499.80s]  Can't afford it. Oh, okay, I do need five. I need five ore. I was looking down here for some reason.
[16500.76s -> 16511.88s]  All right, let's get some ore. What do I have to trade? Crystals. How many do I need? Five or ten?
[16512.68s -> 16536.62s]  Did I not go... oh, shit, right. I didn't shake the hand. Cliff nest. Thunderbirds. Golden birds. Nice.
[16536.62s -> 16556.23s]  All right, so 15 health, 60. What's the difference? Speed. Chief. Gold birds. Lightning strike. Oh,
[16556.23s -> 16561.03s]  that's different. Okay, cool. I think I'm in a pretty good spot. I think I'm in a pretty good
[16561.03s -> 16576.66s]  spot right now. I'm pretty confident. Let's get this stuff claimed again. More gold. Get this homestead.
[16577.38s -> 16591.88s]  Want that. Okay, what have we got? Still the same weak lookout tower. I mean, I could just build it
[16591.88s -> 16603.13s]  just because. But no, that's precious wood. Let's do another upgrade to this one here. Cyclops cave.
[16603.77s -> 16617.48s]  I need the ogre fort. 20 wood. 20 and 20. Two things that I don't have.
[16619.00s -> 16638.46s]  I mean, it's gonna wipe me out, but let's get eight. And then what about this? This is not
[16638.46s -> 16660.49s]  bad exchange right now. What do I need? Three. I mean, 20 and 20, right? Fuck, I need money.
[16667.38s -> 16679.40s]  I don't have any favorable. No, it's all good. I'll just wait. We're not at the end of the week yet. I
[16679.40s -> 16685.26s]  can afford it. Tax day. Tax day is coming up. Not right now. I still have a couple of days.
[16691.75s -> 16702.42s]  16,000. No, wrong place. Upgrade the ogre fort. No, this is a regular fort.
[16703.37s -> 16725.46s]  From where is it here? All right. Yeah. Just try to come get me now. All right, that's good.
[16726.86s -> 16731.61s]  You are continuing your path. I've already done this. What do I have for points?
[16731.61s -> 16741.42s]  Upgraded my points. There's the Dwarven treasury. It's been deserted. I've been to the obelisk
[16741.42s -> 16751.72s]  already, but I'm gonna take another turn. Do I have enough pieces? No. All right. Uncharted
[16751.72s -> 16756.86s]  territory for the first time. The warrior's tomb. Do I wish to search the tomb? I do.
[16759.05s -> 16782.79s]  Oh no, that's not good. What happened? Did I just get super morale decrease? Sulfur. Very bad morale.
[16783.75s -> 16797.32s]  Minus three from the warrior tomb. Dicks. All right, what have I got? This is the last day
[16797.32s -> 16805.94s]  before the new week in taxes, so let me see if I can build something. I need to spend this money.
[16806.50s -> 16821.62s]  What about this new town? Maybe I should save money. Fountain of Fortune. Enchanted Springs.
[16822.42s -> 16838.18s]  Ooh. Yeah, let's get it. Which is silver pegasi. All right, here comes a new week.
[16838.90s -> 16859.99s]  Notice how purple is painful. Like the rabbit. Move you around. Plus one luck for the next battle.
[16859.99s -> 16877.27s]  There's another. Uh-oh. This is purple's last defense. Ammo carts. Unlimited ammunition.
[16878.07s -> 16884.54s]  Should I get the ammunition one? Do I already have one of these? I don't know if I'm confident to
[16884.54s -> 16896.39s]  get in there. Get the tent. I think I already have one. Just get it, yeah. I've got everything,
[16896.39s -> 16907.77s]  though. Um, you've got several. Lots. Lots. Pack several. Few. It might not be a good idea.
[16907.77s -> 16913.43s]  I could probably do it, but I don't have the range, I don't think. I'm not confident.
[16919.78s -> 16931.85s]  But I do have money and we have a ton of new recruits. Oh, you have every earth spell. Yeah,
[16931.85s -> 16939.88s]  that's true. I could just like earthquake them. Should I delete these? Yeah, just dismiss these
[16939.88s -> 16960.10s]  idiots. Or yeah, just get out of here. Here we go. 26,003 to get all this stuff. This is turning
[16960.10s -> 16963.86s]  into another great army. There's three giants. What does it take to upgrade the giants?
[16965.88s -> 16977.06s]  25,030. I can do this in another turn or two. I'll be able to do it. I'll have unstoppable units.
[16977.78s -> 16989.19s]  Let's just recruit everybody just to do it. Yeah, bring them all in. Oh, okay, hold on. Wait.
[16990.70s -> 16997.56s]  Skeletons. No, that's good. I'm running out of money, though.
[17004.62s -> 17014.58s]  Oh, here's the taxes. What are you doing over here? He's coming for blood. I think he's coming.
[17014.58s -> 17045.40s]  He's going for it. I think he's going for it. I need to upgrade somebody. I have chieftains,
[17045.40s -> 17057.86s]  wolf riders, or hobgoblins. No, I already have a wolf pen. 1,005 and five. I need some more wood.
[17062.98s -> 17072.82s]  Terrible exchange. Awful exchange, right? This is bad. I'm gonna need five, so I have what? Two.
[17091.43s -> 17098.47s]  Do I have enough money to do this? 1,400. All right, they are now wolf raiders.
[17099.35s -> 17109.13s]  I'm gonna lose the talent. I might not. I may not. This is a really good defense.
[17110.09s -> 17122.89s]  This game's 20 years old and it holds up really well. Yeah, it's just the classic,
[17123.61s -> 17133.18s]  you know? It's just a very, very, very fun game. You can go so elaborate with this game. I mean,
[17134.14s -> 17140.09s]  sorry, keep bumping the mic. This is, I think, four players in a medium-sized map. You can do
[17140.09s -> 17146.57s]  extra large with eight people and you can put it on very fucking hard. I saved, see? Look.
[17147.21s -> 17153.30s]  I'll do it again. See, right now I have the difficulty on normal. The map difficulty is
[17153.30s -> 17159.85s]  normal and then I have like the player difficulty on like, what's that, like one notch up,
[17159.85s -> 17171.13s]  essentially. You can really just bring it up or down. You can make the game real fucking hard.
[17171.77s -> 17187.30s]  I wonder if I should go for this. Let me just see what's down here. All right, there's a mine.
[17187.30s -> 17192.55s]  There's a couple of things. I'm just gonna go outside his front door. I'm gonna take everything
[17192.55s -> 17203.27s]  in his front door. Would you like to recruit centaurs? 14 centaurs join your army. I didn't
[17203.27s -> 17211.43s]  mean that to be like a horse, but like, I mean, I'll take them. I had a spot for him. I'm right
[17211.43s -> 17224.55s]  outside of his door. I'm just waiting out here. All right, here comes a fight because you look
[17224.55s -> 17228.55s]  like you're coming over here. How are we doing? We're all right. We got enough at least for a
[17228.55s -> 17237.34s]  standoff here. Take it. I can't move anymore. I have to wait till next turn. Let's see what he does.
[17237.90s -> 17248.04s]  There he comes. He's going for it. He's coming with everything he has. This is his entire army.
[17248.04s -> 17254.39s]  He's pissed. We took his city and now he's like, fuck this. I'm coming with 300 centaurs.
[17255.29s -> 17281.40s]  Uh, all right. Death ripple. Curse bloodlust. Curse. Disrupting ray. I could do bloodlust or
[17281.40s -> 17296.60s]  just lightning bolt. Throw curse. Yeah. Curse the archers. Curse the archer. But they're gonna just
[17296.60s -> 17301.96s]  gonna fly in. I think he's gonna take the castle. Maybe not. Curse the archers so they don't do any
[17301.96s -> 17319.26s]  damage. And then I just gotta, I gotta sit in here. I can't go anywhere. I can't just jump out there.
[17324.87s -> 17331.03s]  No. That's too many centaurs. Hopefully at least the archers will take care of it.
[17332.31s -> 17344.58s]  Do I even have any ranged at all? I don't think I have any. Besides the towers. Well,
[17344.58s -> 17348.66s]  they're gonna make their way over here. I wish I could just throw an axe at you.
[17354.22s -> 17365.21s]  No. Hurts. Okay. No, this is ranged. This is ranged. It's an axe thrower. Ugh. I don't know.
[17365.21s -> 17374.86s]  Right, the front door. Try to just throw. Or should I go for the archer? This is gonna be,
[17375.58s -> 17408.02s]  it's not great. But once she gets in, she's gonna fly over the gate. Fuck. Come on. No.
[17408.74s -> 17417.66s]  The gates have been breached. This is bad. Gates are open. All right. It's time. I'm gonna go
[17417.66s -> 17439.00s]  bloodlust. Either bloodlust or earth magic. This is not the same person. This is a different person.
[17439.82s -> 17448.63s]  Different hero. Am I out of mana? No, that's not good. Can I do anything? I'm fucked.
[17450.22s -> 17456.89s]  Ah, I have to just go out and start fighting. Who do I want to try to take out first?
[17462.55s -> 17469.88s]  It's not completely over yet. Not yet. Really the only real major scary thing is this guy and this
[17469.88s -> 17483.19s]  guy. And the archers too. I gotta go in. It's 57 trees. Yeah, this is bad. Well, at least I put up
[17483.19s -> 17490.06s]  a defense. I'm gonna just gonna fly in and see if we can take out some of the centaurs. Damage
[17490.06s -> 17500.36s]  through health. I mean, these things are good. They're trying to kill the thunderbirds immediately.
[17505.78s -> 17508.90s]  I could probably take out a bunch of these though. There's so many of them.
[17510.46s -> 17525.69s]  Ah. I could fly up here and just go for the archers. But I can only fly this far. See if I can
[17525.69s -> 17534.39s]  make something happen. All right, you didn't like that. Holy shit. That was not good. All right.
[17538.30s -> 17559.19s]  Just get the fuck out here. Game over. Ah. I can't hurt... I can't do anything.
[17559.83s -> 17563.19s]  You got... You can't hurt everything. Might as well just whack this thing.
[17564.23s -> 17581.21s]  No. They don't stand a chance. Why do they have to piss purple off?
[17582.82s -> 17588.63s]  Well, I don't mind losing this because it's not like there's a lot here.
[17589.99s -> 17596.22s]  I can get it back. Plus, dude, I'm about to go destroy his whole... He's only gonna have one place.
[17597.18s -> 17606.71s]  He spends all of his money to get his revenge and that's fine. I could care less. I'm standing
[17606.71s -> 17621.37s]  outside his front door. I just bought this guy yesterday. See, look at this. Several few lots,
[17621.37s -> 17630.57s]  pack several, pack few. I think I can get in there. And then I have this down here and this
[17630.57s -> 17637.34s]  is definitely decked out. This place has to be. I got all the best spells in the game. Let's go for
[17637.34s -> 17655.19s]  it. Oh, that did a lot of damage. All right, here we go. Earth. Earth elemental or implosion.
[17655.19s -> 17663.77s]  Should I implode the dragon? I'm gonna fucking implode the dragon. Excuse me. Sorry, but I'm
[17663.77s -> 17674.74s]  about to kill at least two of you. That does so much damage and two of them have been removed.
[17675.38s -> 17682.89s]  That's how you can tell that this thing is fucking crazy. I'm all right with this, though. I got
[17682.89s -> 17687.53s]  a good... What's the damage on... I wonder if I should buff somebody. Let's just go in.
[17690.42s -> 17700.33s]  They don't do that much damage. 13 to 16, not worth it. Haste on the mage. What the hell are
[17700.33s -> 17703.30s]  you doing to me? Come on, come on out the front door. I'm gonna kill the dragon before you get
[17703.30s -> 17711.90s]  out of here. Fucking morale. Whatever. All right, beat him up. Punch him right in the face.
[17711.90s -> 17718.89s]  Go for the dragons? Or should I just remove the... Go for the dragon. Everybody. Everybody
[17718.89s -> 17730.33s]  focus on the dragons. I'm so glad these skeletons are just taking the damage here. They're just
[17730.33s -> 17742.17s]  eating this. Thank God. They ate that whole thing. All right, Genie. You gotta get one hit. That's
[17742.17s -> 17756.50s]  all I ask. Hit one time. One hit. Yes. The immediate threat is not the unicorn. I think it's... Is it
[17756.50s -> 17768.62s]  the unicorn? I don't know. Is it the... The Medusa's probably? Got it. All right, I gotta get the
[17768.62s -> 17790.50s]  gargoyles up front. You did... That was a big mistake. Front door not open. All right, let's
[17790.50s -> 17806.46s]  implode. There's more danger, I see. Let's see. Three to seven. Two to three. Let's... I'm just...
[17806.46s -> 17835.42s]  I'm gonna implode the archers. I have taken your castle. It's mine. With minimal loss. Overkill.
[17835.42s -> 17846.94s]  I wanted to like assert my dominance here. Genie should end this in one hit. Nimbus versus the
[17846.94s -> 17855.56s]  gold dragons. Didn't... I lost a bunch of skeletons, but here we go. Let's see how decked out this
[17855.56s -> 17872.70s]  place is. Holy shit. Hey, thanks. Thanks for like the decked out house. Castle. Fountain of Fortune.
[17875.18s -> 17886.31s]  Enchanted Springs. Unicorn glade. War unicorns. Yep. Yeah, thanks for the house. And thanks for the
[17887.19s -> 17891.45s]  new hero that I'm going to have that is going to be decked out. Who's it going to be?
[17892.17s -> 17909.99s]  Out Mr. Heretic. Probably the heretic. So I don't care if I lost that place. Basic pathfinding has
[17909.99s -> 17919.91s]  been found out. Chris's morale. Finally I get some more stuff to claim. Two wood a day. Thank God.
[17920.95s -> 17930.66s]  Now let's get another hero. The heretic. And let's at least recruit a bunch of these.
[17931.46s -> 17944.58s]  I have a gold dragon now. Pretty awesome. Where are we in the week? I have no money now.
[17944.58s -> 17951.48s]  Purple has holed up here. Look at this. Is that? No, that's my boat. I'm gonna say where's purple?
[17954.04s -> 17957.80s]  I think it's time to bring out the... Let me get some more money first.
[17958.60s -> 17964.42s]  Let's see where the purple has one remaining boat coming this way.
[17964.42s -> 17977.93s]  Hey. You motherfucker. I'm coming to take my castle back. No, you're not. In fact,
[17977.93s -> 17984.60s]  I'm going to hang out here because I'm stacking this place. A thousand experience. That's good.
[17985.94s -> 17993.45s]  Centaur stables. What does that lead to? Yeah, I'll take some centaurs. Check out the windmill.
[17993.45s -> 18000.89s]  All right. Let's just hang out over here. I got 12,000 gold. Let's get a bunch of stuff.
[18001.77s -> 18012.09s]  It's like imps kind of taking up space here. You know what? Here, I'll trade you next week.
[18015.38s -> 18026.79s]  Blue keeps on going back and forth to the dragon cave. What are you doing? Should I go over there
[18026.79s -> 18031.27s]  or should I not go over there? I don't know. Should I go? Should I stay? He's coming back.
[18032.07s -> 18037.98s]  I'm gonna have to wait for him here. He's gonna come back. I'm just gonna get some money.
[18038.70s -> 18048.09s]  Here he comes. Oh, wait a minute. He went the other way. Oh, fuck. I forgot about this castle.
[18048.09s -> 18062.78s]  He went the other direction. Oh, no. He got word from the scouts. They only got one person. Oh,
[18062.78s -> 18077.74s]  you fucking idiot. God damn it. You're dead, man. I completely fucking forgot. Oh, that sucks.
[18084.23s -> 18093.35s]  I just have to get a decent group together here. Come here. Let me give the...
[18094.07s -> 18105.54s]  Come here. That's his only force. He's just taking it all over the world. Okay. I want...
[18107.10s -> 18114.68s]  I'm sending you... Hold on. Let me look at this. You get out of here for a minute.
[18114.68s -> 18135.05s]  I need to look. Let's see. What's better? Send Nimbus home to restock. It just takes so long.
[18135.05s -> 18143.03s]  I'm on the other side of the world at this point. It's empty now. He just... He's leaving every
[18143.03s -> 18149.27s]  castle empty. I have like five castles and like four... The one he attacks is the one that doesn't
[18149.27s -> 18164.12s]  have fucking things in it. Everything else... Look it. Everywhere else has stuff. He's just hanging
[18164.12s -> 18174.28s]  out over here. You're a pain in my ass. Maybe we should just both go get him. Meet him on the open
[18174.28s -> 18185.72s]  field. Not yet. I need to like have the correct... Shit. I'm gonna recruit all these fucking people.
[18187.75s -> 18198.62s]  Here we go. All right. Bang. 93 centaur captains. That's really good. Let me see what you got on
[18198.62s -> 18206.84s]  you. You got like this... I'm just gonna send you to like your death. I definitely want the dragon
[18208.89s -> 18214.62s]  and the centaur captains. It's the imps. The imps are fucking this whole thing up.
[18215.26s -> 18234.68s]  All right. Come here. I'm dumping the imps. We're both going up there. You guys just stay here.
[18236.25s -> 18248.02s]  93 captains. Now what do we have here? Centaurs... I'm gonna trade him the centaur captains.
[18248.02s -> 18261.43s]  So he has 93 captains. 16 naga queens. Should I trade out the skeletons for the dragon?
[18261.43s -> 18274.84s]  Skeletons for the dragon or skeletons for the pegasus? I feel like I really want the pegasus
[18274.84s -> 18287.61s]  though. But what do I give up? The golems? Trinket's a good... Golems are a good wall
[18287.61s -> 18293.26s]  though. But now I have the centaur captains. Wait. Hold on. Let me look. Damage 2 to 3. Health 10,
[18293.26s -> 18306.22s]  12. I mean, not that much. They're not that great. It's not worth using a slot for one unit.
[18307.02s -> 18315.98s]  No, but I mean it's got 250 health. There are 93 centaur captains in here and they all have 10
[18315.98s -> 18320.50s]  health. You know what I mean? Like I need like two or three dragons and it's immune to spells.
[18321.14s -> 18336.94s]  There's 93 of them though. The archers too would be good. They have pretty good damage.
[18346.33s -> 18349.85s]  This is an unbelievable unit. This is an unbelievable unit.
[18350.89s -> 18372.34s]  The gargoyles probably for the trance. Does this... We need... We got range here.
[18372.66s -> 18386.81s]  Send in Kallad to soften them up. We're gonna go together. All right. Yeah. We're gonna send
[18386.81s -> 18394.90s]  in like this little imp first. He's gonna take out like four of them. He's gonna take out a bunch of
[18394.90s -> 18401.48s]  them and then I'm gonna... Like dad's gonna come in and clean it up. I think that's good as it is.
[18408.62s -> 18415.72s]  All right. Out of money. I'm ready for the actual purple battle because then these... Look at
[18415.72s -> 18421.64s]  they both these castles are empty. He's got nobody there. Not one person. Not one person.
[18421.64s -> 18431.58s]  He's just a riding castle. He's riding around with the castle on his back. It's time. Soften
[18431.58s -> 18458.97s]  him up. Let's go. Uh oh. Blue's coming in. Here we go. He's coming down here.
[18463.40s -> 18468.12s]  This is it for purple. It is because look it. Blue's coming in to take this free castle and
[18468.12s -> 18475.74s]  then this is it. Purple will be wiped out from the game. Purple is not going to exist anymore
[18475.74s -> 18484.49s]  after this. There's gonna be three people left. Do you have any of this shit? I don't think he
[18484.49s -> 18495.26s]  even has this. It's just fine to take one. Wait. Hold on. Do you have... All right. Just soften
[18495.26s -> 18504.52s]  them up. You'll be good. I'm going in. All right. I have like these these two booger enemies.
[18505.56s -> 18514.36s]  I'm gonna hang out back here just for a minute because like I... What if he doesn't... Somebody's
[18514.36s -> 18517.48s]  gonna come from the other side and take this castle. All right. There goes that one.
[18521.72s -> 18530.63s]  Wait. There's an energy elemental grove. Is that purple? What the fuck are you doing over here?
[18530.63s -> 18540.36s]  Where does purple have another castle? Down here? No. Impossible. All right. Go fucking go get him.
[18541.00s -> 18568.15s]  You're good. He's not gonna come back. Creeping up. Let's go. Blue is down. Brown has just been
[18568.15s -> 18578.89s]  in the top left. There's the taxes. Okay. You dick. Save the game. Go get him.
[18580.74s -> 18604.66s]  Purple does not have anything left. All right. Let's go. Charge. You want to go? It's time to go.
[18606.17s -> 18611.77s]  Hypnotize. Put an enemy unit temporarily under your control. I don't even have enough points
[18611.77s -> 18632.47s]  for this. Do you have any points? Ice bolt. Ice bolt on the archers. You just open the front door.
[18632.79s -> 18646.39s]  What a mistake. I'm going... Should I... I'm going in? This wasn't even worth doing. I can't soften
[18646.39s -> 18683.99s]  him up. He's got like about 500 people. It's because he's in the castle too. Damn it. You just...
[18685.99s -> 18696.14s]  Damn it. I need like a fucking... I need like a thousand people. I need more like range and...
[18702.68s -> 18718.10s]  I need a ton of archers. I need to stack ranged on somebody. Who do we have here? We have more units.
[18718.10s -> 18725.99s]  I got two more dragons. Okay. I got more dragons. More archers. I'm just gonna play
[18725.99s -> 18734.36s]  the turtle game for a minute here. Look at all this too. I gotta start to get this out here.
[18735.00s -> 18747.14s]  Delete the booger units. Yeah. I'm just... Get rid of these things. You guys suck. Get out of here.
[18749.72s -> 18774.18s]  Yeah. Goodbye. All right. Come back. Everybody back. Back it up. This way. Where does this go?
[18775.06s -> 18788.15s]  One-way entrance. What does that monolith exit end up? I can teleport? I have teleport?
[18788.87s -> 18797.58s]  Oh, this is all earth. Town portal. The nearest friendly town. The town must be unoccupied.
[18799.38s -> 18820.23s]  Oh my god. View earth. I mean... All right. Hold on. This is important. You... All right. I gotta...
[18820.23s -> 18831.74s]  Just... New turn. I gotta get everybody in buildings because I don't want to teleport you here
[18831.82s -> 18844.14s]  because you're right next to it. They exit to the one that's orange up here. Yeah, but that... I
[18844.14s -> 18857.56s]  don't want to be up here. All right. I gotta get a plan. The plan is I need to get you in this building.
[18858.36s -> 18875.72s]  Nobody attack me, please. Okay. You have to get in here. First of all, let's get this correct.
[18877.06s -> 18885.02s]  Three dragons. Sixty. Okay. I've got a little group of, like, idiots.
[18889.16s -> 18898.66s]  I'm gonna stack them all. So do I just... What do you have? Yeah. Bring them... Just bring them all
[18898.66s -> 18926.52s]  back. Bring them all back. Because I need to... Come here. There we go. 123, 19. Now you get the
[18926.52s -> 18936.82s]  fuck back in here like that. You're not... I know. I know. You must delete the skeletons.
[18937.78s -> 18951.30s]  All right. 44 arches. I just need to... I need to think about this for a second.
[18953.40s -> 18965.45s]  You've got... Pegasus are really good. Maybe trade the iron golems at this point.
[18966.90s -> 18976.10s]  So now I can teleport to the nearest town, which is here, I think. Because I get in here and I
[18976.10s -> 18987.22s]  remove this hero from the town, right? And actually, no, I don't want him to... I don't
[18987.22s -> 18995.06s]  want him to go here. There's nothing here worth taking. The nearest town is the one you're at.
[18995.70s -> 19001.80s]  Yeah, but it didn't say that... That as long as this town must be unoccupied,
[19002.44s -> 19006.52s]  teleport to the nearest friendly town, the town must be unoccupied. So if a town is occupied,
[19006.52s -> 19015.14s]  will it take me to the next one? That's not how it works. Will that work? Yeah, you just take
[19015.14s -> 19020.66s]  a hero out, right? So I want to go here because there's a lot... Yeah, I gotta get up here. Look
[19020.66s -> 19030.84s]  at all these recruits. All right, so first action of teleportation is this. We're going up here.
[19032.63s -> 19044.39s]  There's giants here too. There's... All right, I gotta fucking think about this shit. You... Okay.
[19045.50s -> 19052.30s]  Will you go into this town? This one is also occupied. They all are, right? Unoccupied,
[19052.30s -> 19072.97s]  occupied, occupied. Cast a spell. Town portal. Stop. Take the units out too. Okay, I'm out.
[19076.46s -> 19100.41s]  Spell. Town portal. Here we go. Save it. All right. Town portal. Here we go. What? Too tired. Oh,
[19100.41s -> 19108.23s]  he's coming down. He's ignoring me. Okay. Town portal. Do you want to teleport to the Emerald
[19108.23s -> 19114.90s]  Moor? Which one is that? No, I don't want to teleport here. God damn it. Do I actually have
[19114.90s -> 19133.43s]  to go all the way over here? That's... I have to actually travel that far? Shit. Put a hero in front
[19133.43s -> 19151.10s]  of the town. You mean like... Wait, what is this? One... Lot and lot. I could get it right now.
[19151.82s -> 19158.73s]  So you said what you're saying. If I go in here and I go like this...
[19160.25s -> 19172.15s]  Let's see what happens. Okay, so he's selected. Nearest town occupied. Spell failed. Yeah,
[19172.15s -> 19186.20s]  unfortunately. All right, I'm ready to start doing this shit again. Golems. I kind of want the
[19186.20s -> 19195.70s]  dragons, but I wonder if I just replace the dragons with golems. I got three of them now.
[19195.70s -> 19204.97s]  That's a lot of health. And then go up and take the town. Bring the archers with me probably too.
[19204.97s -> 19228.18s]  So I need archers. Who doesn't need to come on this trip? Leave the trance. Get the golems over
[19228.18s -> 19238.46s]  Pegasus. I think that I'll be able to get this town up there. Health 30. Health 35. Damage 345.
[19239.10s -> 19254.17s]  They're both really good. The unicorns are insane too. They only have so many slots. All right,
[19254.17s -> 19268.04s]  I'll keep this here for now. I'm going to go take that town back. Purple is going to turn around
[19268.04s -> 19284.04s]  and that's fine. Whatever. Get back up here. Now the question is, upgrade the tit- to get to titans.
[19284.84s -> 19304.15s]  Yes, I can now have titans. I have lots to recruit. This is Swiss Silverwing. Silverwing is down
[19304.15s -> 19316.68s]  there. Okay, so I'm going to recruit a bunch of stuff. I can only do that many. You just go back
[19316.68s -> 19326.30s]  in here because like there's no reason for you to be out here anymore. Go up there. There's a titan.
[19326.94s -> 19333.56s]  You can just take the iron golems. You're going to be just hanging out here anyways.
[19335.37s -> 19339.21s]  Titan has ranged attacks. Yeah, and I'm going to upgrade the other ones that I have too.
[19339.85s -> 19365.96s]  I cannot. I'm out of mine. Just hang out there for now. Okay, everybody relax. Let's go. Okay,
[19365.96s -> 19392.09s]  you are down here now. Where are you going? Uh oh. This city sucks. The city is going to fall. It
[19392.09s -> 19399.74s]  just has like 200 little trolls. Maybe he's not going to come that far. It's going to take him a
[19399.74s -> 19407.30s]  couple turns. He's not going to take this one. That's for sure. All right, give me back my
[19407.30s -> 19429.74s]  fucking town, please. How much can I make more recruits? No, stop, stop. Two titans. Yeah,
[19430.30s -> 19446.39s]  you're not going to take this. He ain't going to make it. Here comes Brown, finally.
[19449.02s -> 19456.33s]  Brown's making his way over here now. Give me this. What do you got? You don't got anything here.
[19456.33s -> 19468.34s]  Let's go. Give me it back. All right, dragon. Go in here and instantly kill them. Thank you.
[19480.14s -> 19491.51s]  Stone skin. 111 dead. Done in a second. Just cast a lightning bolt.
[19493.42s -> 19507.96s]  Just wait. Give me my castle back. Expert offense or advanced learning. Expert offense, I think.
[19509.56s -> 19528.18s]  30%. My home. I got it back. Okay, this is where we're going to leave. First, let's walk in there.
[19528.18s -> 19538.23s]  That'd be nice. Archers are going up. Centaurs are going up. When's the new week? It's coming up.
[19538.87s -> 19553.53s]  Dragons are staying. Staying, staying, staying, staying. The reason why I'm doing this is because
[19553.53s -> 19568.71s]  I want to just feed a ton of these units into here. What's the building? What's the town hall?
[19568.71s -> 19577.38s]  Treasury. 10% interest in gold through green dragons. Everything else is enchanted. Let's
[19577.38s -> 19587.29s]  do this just to get it. New week is coming up. We get taxes coming in. End of the stream. What
[19587.29s -> 19604.36s]  are you talking about? All right, so they're in there. You're here. We got enough. We got more
[19604.36s -> 19619.46s]  stuff to recruit. Just keep dumping. 68. More money. I keep forgetting to do that first.
[19620.42s -> 19625.98s]  Let him in. Let him in. Please let me in there at the front door.
[19626.54s -> 19634.44s]  He's coming over here. I only have like three RC cars. Please, they're gonna kill me.
[19635.08s -> 19643.24s]  It'll be fine. There's nobody even on here. It's this guy. He's not gonna make it. That's
[19643.24s -> 19659.91s]  more than a full turn. He ain't gonna make it. We got a new week. Let's go. Somebody got killed.
[19660.86s -> 19673.59s]  Brown just killed somebody. Okay, here he comes. All right. 12,000. Let's upgrade these giants.
[19677.32s -> 19694.06s]  God, that's so expensive. I have five of them. I need more money. Camp him in the city.
[19694.78s -> 19720.04s]  All right. What about the... okay. Wizards. Uh, other wizards. 68, 48, 18, 27, 19, 18,
[19720.04s -> 19724.60s]  40. Okay, this is pretty good. I can't buy anything else. I don't have any money.
[19725.48s -> 19734.82s]  All I can do now is hope and pray because now I can go. But let's see. What we got down here?
[19734.82s -> 19741.46s]  We've got a bunch of... we got so many units to buy. There's so many that it's... I'm getting
[19741.46s -> 19748.02s]  overwhelmed by the amount of units that I can purchase. I need another day to go by.
[19748.02s -> 19770.94s]  I have a lot of sulfur though. Can I get a good exchange on sulfur? Not really. That's a pretty
[19770.94s -> 19784.10s]  bad exchange. Although I can... I mean, I could... I think it's time to take you. I gotta make the
[19784.18s -> 19797.22s]  journey back. I can get two more dragons. I think five dragons. Here's the plan. Five dragons?
[19798.86s -> 19803.58s]  Yeah, he's just like running back and forth like on a route. Yeah, I'm gonna get you two more
[19803.58s -> 19813.11s]  dragons. Because it's a new week, I'm gonna get five gold dragons and now I'm just gonna get some
[19813.11s -> 19818.66s]  money. I'm protected at least enough where no one's gonna kill me. I'm protected completely.
[19818.66s -> 19827.96s]  Here he comes. Stupid fucking taxes. There he is. Here he comes. He's coming in. I gotta be ready.
[19827.96s -> 19836.55s]  He's coming in. This is my... guys, this is the main city. So if this falls, it's gonna be really
[19836.55s -> 19852.07s]  sad. What do I need for this? I need the library. I don't have a fucking library. Why did I not
[19852.07s -> 19879.40s]  build a library? Seven titans. Seven goddamn titans. Am I gonna lose with seven titans?
[19880.12s -> 19892.33s]  He didn't have like... I have seven fucking titans. I feel like I've just been playing against purple
[19892.33s -> 19898.66s]  this whole game while the other two just build up their resources forever. Just give me my damn
[19898.66s -> 19915.56s]  dragon. Here we go. If we lose, we lose. Whatever. Here he comes. Okay, this is it. I got like mines
[19915.56s -> 19924.81s]  and shit. Let's go. What do we got? Wizard. Buff the titan. We're good for spells. Force field.
[19924.81s -> 19931.69s]  Animate the dead. Destroy undead. Lightning bolt. How much do I have any points? 80 points versus
[19931.69s -> 19949.37s]  50. That's so many, but I can do it. I'm thinking put a curse on their archer or a curse on their
[19951.06s -> 19966.38s]  pegasus. The pegasus is gonna fly right over. My pegasus has to die. Okay, curse on the archer.
[19967.02s -> 19981.05s]  And then I'm gonna buff... I'm gonna buff the titan. All in on titan. Here we go. Yes! Okay,
[19981.05s -> 19988.12s]  that's... for being that far away, that's very, very good. That is exceptionally good. I ain't
[19988.12s -> 20004.98s]  moving anybody. Step on the mine. Idiot. How many archers are here? I can't tell. This is gonna be
[20004.98s -> 20021.18s]  all in on titan. No, don't move. Let them hurt themselves. That hurts so much. That hurts so
[20021.18s -> 20032.76s]  much. That sucked. Do I stand at the front door? I think I have to stand at the front door. They're
[20032.84s -> 20039.54s]  gonna kill them. They can't get in yet, but I'm gonna get at the front door. I'm going right here.
[20040.86s -> 20052.28s]  Okay, now it's the... the magi. I just gotta go for the archers. 29. How many treants? 70 fucking
[20052.28s -> 20067.14s]  three treants. 73! I'm never gonna kill 73 of these. Who's up? Genie. Titan. All in.
[20068.02s -> 20090.01s]  Cross the map. No. Holy shit, that was fucking insane. I just killed a hundred. I killed almost
[20090.01s -> 20098.82s]  one fucking hundred of them. All right, all in on titan. That's all that matters. I wonder,
[20098.82s -> 20107.82s]  do I fly you out here just to be a pain in the ass? Or not yet. I think I'm gonna curse the...
[20109.02s -> 20118.73s]  I'm gonna curse the pegasus because this next turn she's flying over. She's gonna fly over
[20118.73s -> 20143.19s]  this next turn. Fly the gargoyle over the archers? Yeah. Let's go on. Force field. I don't know. I'm
[20143.19s -> 20150.63s]  scared. What does the force field do? I've never used it. I'm gonna play... I'm gonna do Stuart
[20150.63s -> 20166.12s]  Smart. Here we go. These two are now worthless. Now I'm going in. This is it. These are my two
[20166.12s -> 20177.51s]  strongest units. It's fine. Pegasus is gonna be dead. Almost left. Nine pegasus die. Yep,
[20177.51s -> 20181.51s]  that was a good distraction. I'm okay with this. He's not coming in now.
[20183.16s -> 20204.92s]  Oh shit, he's in. Not the genie! This is bad. Destroy Undead. I'll give it a try.
[20205.56s -> 20231.58s]  How many are left? I can't tell. Is it five? I can only shoot. Like, the... No, no, what are you doing?
[20235.18s -> 20243.70s]  I thought it was gonna... What? I thought it was a range. It's all in on the goddamn titan. It's
[20243.70s -> 20270.62s]  still possible. Destroy Undead. It fucking barely did shit. All in on titan. How many are fucking
[20270.62s -> 20286.95s]  left? What? Oh my god, there's too many of them. There's so many of them. Are you trying to tell
[20286.95s -> 20294.65s]  me that seven fucking upgraded titans cannot kill a fucking pegasus? Are you... Eat my fucking...
[20295.77s -> 20315.91s]  Ah! I'm actually upset right now. There's only 15 of you. Get over here. Don't step on a landmine.
[20316.47s -> 20328.12s]  Come on, titan. I know you can do this. I'm fucking certain you can do it. You can do it. You
[20328.12s -> 20330.60s]  can do it. Stay alive. Stay alive. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it.
[20331.74s -> 20353.42s]  Bleh! No! This is just too fucking goddamn. I lost everything. The army was just so enormous.
[20353.98s -> 20365.11s]  Whatever. We have a new home now. God damn it. I mean, I've got like five fucking thousand enemies.
[20365.99s -> 20386.36s]  Fuck! Who do I have down here? Who's even up here? I gotta go... Okay, I've gotta bring you up here.
[20386.36s -> 20398.78s]  Grab this shit. Let me go in here. I need... I'm going to get... I can get five... It doesn't
[20398.78s -> 20417.88s]  matter how many dragons I have. Gold dragons. Five gold dragons. Could I go up there and kill
[20417.88s -> 20429.59s]  them now that it's softened? I don't know. I mean, it's... Look, it's gonna take me fucking like
[20430.31s -> 20435.53s]  a week to get back over there. There's nothing in there. He just... He's just running around.
[20436.89s -> 20443.61s]  This dude just put a thousand people on one guy and has just been walking around in circles.
[20443.61s -> 20447.62s]  That's what I should have done from the very beginning. I shouldn't even have bought any more
[20447.62s -> 20457.61s]  houses. Yeah, he has access to make titans now. Why would I even take like Elsa's castle for any
[20457.61s -> 20467.13s]  reason? Just put five thousand people on one guy. What was I thinking? He's going to come take this
[20467.13s -> 20483.80s]  now. I can't even upgrade this. I don't have any money. What was I thinking? Well, I can teleport
[20484.28s -> 20487.72s]  if I teleport. I can only teleport here. We've tested that like three times.
[20492.86s -> 20503.45s]  I mean, I could just try to go and retake it. What's up there? All right, I'm taking the
[20503.45s -> 20510.50s]  captains. I'm taking the archers. We're going to get some more. I'm going to get... Pegasus,
[20510.50s -> 20520.18s]  let's just put everybody on here. I'm going to go through and recruit. So when I... On the way back
[20520.18s -> 20527.14s]  up, I'll fill this up. I probably should leave... What are these? Health 20. No, these are better.
[20527.70s -> 20546.02s]  I just need money. I just need money. Like, very, very badly. Like, so bad. All right,
[20546.02s -> 20557.10s]  well, here comes another one. All right, 8,000 golds all I have.
[20563.16s -> 20581.93s]  That's just not enough. There are like 100... I guess I could get like 70 archers and like
[20581.93s -> 20596.36s]  180, 200-something centaurs. Who sent out you a page to Melee? I didn't mean to,
[20597.32s -> 20605.53s]  because that would mean I have... Let's see. This is just a lost cause here at this point,
[20605.53s -> 20614.28s]  that one. Go through the red portal and just use the town portal. Yeah, but if I go through
[20614.28s -> 20622.54s]  the red portal, I just end up right here. Oh, do I end up here? Which one do I go through?
[20623.34s -> 20632.57s]  And then use the town portal to get to like here, but then I still have to go all the way across
[20632.57s -> 20639.64s]  here if I want to take it. I want to stop here and grab that furry because, I mean, I don't have
[20639.64s -> 20650.84s]  enough enemies. I definitely don't have enough to take that on, because I can't take any of
[20650.84s -> 20656.70s]  this shit. So I'm just going to go with this. I'm going to go recruit and see if I can get
[20656.70s -> 20671.02s]  anything done. Because there's a ton up here. No, no, just give me the... give me archers.
[20672.06s -> 20682.26s]  Give me these, because that's a lot of archers to have. How many pegasus do I have on this guy?
[20683.59s -> 20686.79s]  Pegasus and unicorns. All right, yeah, just... I'm making a pit stop
[20687.59s -> 20703.35s]  right up here. And then I'm gonna walk up here. Go through the portal? Well, if I go through the
[20703.35s -> 20720.10s]  portal, I'm gonna have to teleport back to here anyways. I'm going up here. This will put me at
[20720.10s -> 20737.70s]  at least 100 plus. What do I have for points right now? Again, I'm maxed out. That's good.
[20739.83s -> 20762.28s]  Back up again to recruit more. Just keep time going. No, no, go in the building.
[20762.84s -> 20774.17s]  Oh, for the love of god. All right, this is this is where we do it. So I'm gonna report right change
[20774.17s -> 20796.47s]  out. Maybe the mages? No, I need that. They're ranged too. 29. I don't have that. I can't upgrade
[20796.47s -> 20814.38s]  those. Can I upgrade these? I can make this a capital. And all right, so that's 141. 29 pegasus.
[20815.34s -> 20828.66s]  16 queens. Five gold dragons. Who do we leave behind here? Or do we just
[20830.04s -> 20844.54s]  stack the ranged instead of the golems? Because there's a lot. There's a decent amount here.
[20845.26s -> 20873.30s]  Maybe the genies. 18 to 22. 110 versus like just not enough of them. Yeah, they're too high value.
[20873.30s -> 20876.10s]  I think I could probably get away with this and then make another person here.
[20876.66s -> 20892.71s]  I'm gonna try with this. I think this is good. Maybe I'll, yeah. I do need more range. I need
[20892.71s -> 20907.29s]  more like just picking people off. That means one, two. Yeah, 141 centaurs. All right. This is,
[20907.29s -> 20915.70s]  this is like the last hurrah here. If I can't make this done, I think this is gonna be good.
[20917.53s -> 20928.76s]  Like, this is it. I'm going for it. Give me a damn boat. I'm going back. I'm not. I mean,
[20928.76s -> 20943.16s]  this is free, but I don't want it. Look at all this. Get in the boat. I'm going up here.
[20943.80s -> 20956.26s]  I'm not close enough to summon one yet. I'm going back to take my home back.
[20957.94s -> 20962.89s]  There you are. Are you gonna meet me out on the open field? Is this what this is?
[20963.69s -> 20970.84s]  Lots hoard. Several. He, look, he kind of replaced all his shit. Did he leave anything in here?
[20971.56s -> 20974.76s]  He kind of didn't. He, I think he may have spread himself out a little too much.
[20974.76s -> 20983.86s]  No, that's Luna. What happened to Ares? He stole my shit. And here he comes for this one. I'm
[20983.86s -> 21005.74s]  fucked. I am so fucked. Teleport home. I'll end up over here. This'll be, this is the closest one.
[21012.65s -> 21021.88s]  He's just in here. See what happened was early. I just was learning how to play the game again
[21021.88s -> 21027.26s]  and I like bled myself out so hard. This is going to be really hard to come back. I think
[21027.26s -> 21034.81s]  I'm going to go for it though. We'll try. Uh, summon boat. I'm going to go for it.
[21034.81s -> 21051.32s]  Whatever. It's like a thousand gold. Just give me a damn boat.
[21068.22s -> 21078.76s]  Here they come. Coming to take my castle. They're just going to take it. There's nothing I can do
[21078.76s -> 21091.64s]  about it. I'm so far behind at this point that if this, I, I'm going to be screwed. What can I do?
[21091.64s -> 21098.09s]  Um, magic arrow. Let's try to kill some centaurs. That's really all I can do.
[21099.05s -> 21125.67s]  Where did they get in? Oh, this is already broken. Fuck. Fight to the very end. Um, yeah, that was,
[21125.67s -> 21133.78s]  that person just killed a hundred, almost two hundred. Yeah, this is unbeatable.
[21134.50s -> 21161.90s]  Can I shoot it up like myself? Just take it. Take it. Run around in a circle with you. A
[21161.90s -> 21175.69s]  five million. Why would you do that? That was BM. I just got fucking BM. That just got roped in
[21175.69s -> 21188.86s]  Hearthstone. Oh, thanks. I had a shot there like an hour ago. Oh, it's like six hours. I fucking had
[21188.86s -> 21206.46s]  it too. And they're both up here. I'm screwed. You're using my own men against me. I meet you
[21206.46s -> 21234.81s]  on the open field. I could probably take you. Is there nobody? I can do it. I could probably take
[21235.45s -> 21282.52s]  God damn it. I have to do another goddamn fucking turn. I need to take out the other person down
[21282.52s -> 21288.74s]  here and let go this way. This only, the only way this works is if like somebody else is doing shit
[21288.74s -> 21299.50s]  down here and I like, I have to wrap around. I have to. This is, this is not, that's not a bad
[21299.50s -> 21315.75s]  crew here. Although I probably would rather have, now this is all right because there's a bunch of
[21315.75s -> 21327.16s]  territory over here. I'm going to go this way. No one's coming down here. Give me this shit back.
[21327.16s -> 21358.41s]  It's mine. Come and get me. And over here. Let's go Seer's Hut. Halflings and Trolls. I don't have
[21358.41s -> 21375.86s]  that. I'm sorry. Take the Mercury. You take back our city please. You can get it. Really just stacked
[21375.86s -> 21383.70s]  it up. You knew I was coming. Pack lots, few, few, several, several lots. I can do it and I'm taking
[21383.70s -> 21396.76s]  my fucking home back in and I'm gonna fucking upgrade everybody. I have a lot. This is a really
[21396.76s -> 21415.53s]  like decent, I got Dragons. It's coming back down. All right. Lots of those mages. Several few. He's
[21415.53s -> 21443.48s]  got Titans. Give me back my fucking house. It's mine. Give it to me. Let's do it. Implode. Implode
[21443.48s -> 21459.56s]  on that Titan. Fly. Should I fly the fucking dragon in? These are my Titans. Dragons should just
[21460.20s -> 21471.82s]  completely just obliterate the uh probably the Titan. Who are these mages? How many mages do
[21471.82s -> 21495.14s]  they have? 32 of these mages back here. Obliterate mages? Yeah not yet. Not yet. I can't buff the
[21495.14s -> 21532.92s]  dragon. Why not? Oh Immune Dispel is right. Okay. Kill the genies. Titan's dead. Titan's down. Genie
[21532.92s -> 21556.92s]  next. Genies. Almost dead. I'm going in. I'm flying in. Taking out the elders. Both genies. Elders.
[21557.48s -> 21581.50s]  Get in there. Elders dead. I get to go twice. Genie dead. Dragon. Obliterate. Genie. Buff. Pegasus.
[21582.14s -> 21612.09s]  Pegasus. Attack. Take. I got my house back. I've got my home back. My home is returned to me. I
[21612.09s -> 21630.70s]  get it back and then I'm going to stack and I'm going hunting. Come on out here. I only lost a few
[21630.70s -> 21650.36s]  people. Archers. Some Pegasi. Give me my goddamn house back. All right. Back in business. Artifact
[21650.36s -> 21669.08s]  merchant. Too bad. I have no growth here. This thing. He already used it. Now the question is
[21669.72s -> 21681.14s]  let's keep looking over here. I got that already. This way. Now I start. This is where the stack
[21681.14s -> 21693.80s]  begins. I'm gonna stack genies and mages by the way. I got elders now. Just get in here and hang
[21693.80s -> 21712.74s]  up. This is where this is redemption here. Uh hold on. I want to pick that up. Give me this.
[21713.54s -> 21731.00s]  All right. Here we go. He's coming back. He's coming back. He's saying to himself, oh how dare
[21731.00s -> 21742.55s]  you horde horde lots pack horde pack. He's coming back. Open field. Can I take him in an open field?
[21742.55s -> 21764.39s]  What do you think? Back. Back. Back. Into the castle. Into the castle. I'm just tracking horde
[21764.39s -> 21786.90s]  dead. On an open field dead. Oh fuck. Uh I'm I don't know what to do. I'm freaking out. All right.
[21787.70s -> 21797.16s]  Morale increase. Witch hut. You just slowly acquire stuff. Stables. Hut of the Magi.
[21798.12s -> 21803.50s]  He tells you places near and far. We're gonna get some more reveal on the maps. We already did it.
[21804.38s -> 21815.37s]  Bring in the breastplate stretcher. So I don't know what that is. The breastplate stretcher. I
[21815.37s -> 21827.70s]  I'm fucking getting tired. I'm ready. I'm I'm kind of scared because okay I'm gonna tell you
[21827.70s -> 21836.57s]  something. If I lose here. If Cinderella's castle goes down. I'm fucked. I'm not gonna be able to
[21836.57s -> 21844.94s]  win this game. This is it. He's coming for me. This is the battle. I can't recruit anybody.
[21844.94s -> 21860.57s]  There's nothing else to do. I can do mage guild level five. No. Let him come. Let him come. Let
[21860.57s -> 21877.21s]  him come. Level five. Air elemental. Water elemental. Berserk. The targeted unit will randomly attack
[21877.21s -> 21893.19s]  the nearest unit be it friend or foe. Oh that's fucking pretty great. He would put your life
[21893.19s -> 21905.72s]  savings on Ares. Mistake. He's coming in. We'll see. He's pissed. Bring it on. No he gave up.
[21906.28s -> 21920.58s]  I'm going after him. I'm just I'm just fucking gonna go after him. No I'm not. I'm taking my
[21920.58s -> 21943.98s]  castle back. Stupid. You want to meet in the fucking open field? I'll do it. What do you think? I'll
[21943.98s -> 21983.80s]  wait right here for you. Oh shit. Oops. What is this? Refugee camp? Where's he going? He
[21983.80s -> 21991.66s]  went by me. I'm fucking gonna kill him. Imp growth. Familiar growth. All dwellings increase.
[21992.46s -> 22010.26s]  They're on an open field. Let's go. Dragon. This is why I want to do it in an open field. Obliterate
[22010.34s -> 22015.96s]  immediately. Who's the biggest threat? Five dragons. No no no. Implode. Implode. Fucking
[22015.96s -> 22028.12s]  instantly kill. Destroy. Implode. Implode on the naga queens. Berserk on the naga queen.
[22031.85s -> 22048.62s]  Berserk on the naga queen. You're all dead. Dragon. Obliterate elders. Straight ahead. Pegasus.
[22050.28s -> 22063.05s]  Um I'm gonna go up here. Just to stay away from the uh the naga queen. What the heck way? I can do
[22063.05s -> 22076.52s]  this though. Why can I buff? I couldn't buff him before. I'm gonna buff the archers. Down my way.
[22077.16s -> 22085.19s]  This is the revenge arc. I'm fucking pissed. First it's purple and then it's blue.
[22085.99s -> 22105.83s]  What do I do here? Naga queen. Beautiful. Bye. I win. Didn't lose anybody. Everyone's alive.
[22107.03s -> 22111.59s]  See you later. What was that Ares? Do you want to come up here? Do you have something you want to
[22111.59s -> 22133.51s]  say? You good? What was this? Star Axis. Plus one spell power. Take this back. Not yet. I'm good. I'm
[22133.51s -> 22140.63s]  going for my fucking town again. I'm gonna claim all the resources. I was so. I was pissed. I was
[22140.63s -> 22144.81s]  pissed. That's how you knew it was time to go. You know what I'm saying? That's how you just. I was.
[22144.81s -> 22157.58s]  It's time to go. I'm sorry. Did I. I'm sorry Romeo. Did I kill Juliet? Come back. I'm waiting for you
[22157.58s -> 22174.95s]  right here. He's. Holy shit. He's mad. Tan has been vanquished. Wait. What? Tan's dead. How?
[22176.15s -> 22190.57s]  Who killed Tan? Tan's dead. Plus one defense. Who wiped off Tan during this whole thing? Orange?
[22191.61s -> 22197.18s]  So it's orange, blue, purple's about to be done. This is purple's last stronghold. Ares is running
[22197.18s -> 22205.32s]  away. I'm gonna have control. Wait. Where are you going? You sailing over here. You motherfucker.
[22205.32s -> 22217.48s]  That's fine. I got my guy down here. I gotta. I gotta claim all this shit back. Give me my sulfur
[22217.48s -> 22227.40s]  factory. Give me. All right. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back. He's coming. He's coming. He's
[22227.40s -> 22234.38s]  coming. He's coming. Blue has the dragons. It don't matter. I'll have ten. I will. I will
[22234.38s -> 22246.60s]  destroy him. Which way is he going? I think he's. Let's just see where he goes. And then I'm. I'm
[22246.60s -> 22252.42s]  gonna have another. I can recruit. I will. Hold on. Hold on a second. Let me just see where this guy's
[22252.42s -> 22261.53s]  going. He's coming over here. Okay. You're going for it, aren't you? He's going for it. He's going
[22261.53s -> 22268.01s]  for it. He's going for it. He really wants it. Can I teleport from here to there? Check this shit out.
[22268.01s -> 22276.17s]  You are fucking dead. I cannot wait to do this. Am I close enough to this one? This was. This is. This
[22276.17s -> 22302.73s]  is uh. Marishen. Uh. There's nobody in here. Except for me. Hi. I'll take some more of these,
[22302.73s -> 22319.22s]  please. Did you. Were you coming over here? Were you. You like on your way over here?
[22320.02s -> 22336.90s]  That's fine, man. In an open field. Thank god I found that fucking artifact. Time to die.
[22341.91s -> 22352.31s]  Oh my god. He has 19 bone dragons. Oh my god. That's a lot. He has 20 bone dragons.
[22353.45s -> 22362.52s]  All right. I'm gonna frenzy bloodlust on that. Will it work? Was. Will Berserk work on you?
[22364.25s -> 22397.26s]  Are you immune to spells? Berserk. Oh. We gotta go in hard. I got five to the liches here.
[22402.31s -> 22419.27s]  Go in. I gotta go in hard immediately. Who the Pegasus going for? This is very important.
[22419.83s -> 22446.73s]  Vampires? Oh. Genie? You know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna move these guys up a little bit.
[22447.45s -> 22459.98s]  Oh no. That's just a super buff. Holy fuck. I blamed the fucking spell in the beginning.
[22460.95s -> 22465.35s]  Oh my god. No. It was a spell in the beginning. It was a spell in the beginning. It ruined
[22465.35s -> 22476.20s]  everything. He is destroying me. The spell in the beginning ruined everything. I could have given it
[22476.20s -> 22485.42s]  to the anybody else. How did you get 20 of these? How did you get 20 bone dragons? You have
[22485.42s -> 22495.34s]  no castles. He doesn't even have a castle. How do you get 20 of these? It's like 500,000 gold.
[22496.38s -> 22515.75s]  He's got no land. He's got no money. How many liches? 30? At this point, I'm just screwed.
[22515.75s -> 22531.90s]  We gotta just go. We gotta try to wipe some out. We gotta try to hurt something. Holy shit, man.
[22532.62s -> 22545.72s]  You gotta be kidding me. 20 fucking goddamn bone dragons. Did you find these? I had like a
[22545.72s -> 22553.24s]  million gold lying around somewhere in a hole somewhere. I buried it. I lose. The only way
[22553.24s -> 22560.02s]  it's as possible is if I can berserk like somebody over here. I berserk, right? On...
[22560.82s -> 22569.80s]  I don't know. Who can I even do this to? The unicorns? The trees? See if that works.
[22571.46s -> 22576.02s]  And then I'm gonna try to buff. I don't fucking know. I don't have anybody left to do this to.
[22580.54s -> 22600.25s]  Archers? I think he's cleansed everybody. One of the fucking dragons. That's a horse. That's dog
[22600.25s -> 22609.37s]  shit. That is impossible. I just saw this guy like a week ago and you didn't have 19 bone dragons.
[22610.17s -> 22632.42s]  I'm dead. 150 health each. Fucking 25 to 50 damage. I really thought I was gonna win this one.
[22644.90s -> 22675.38s]  Fuck. I can't even. That's unfucking believable. I was like so confident to pack a bone dragon.
[22678.22s -> 22692.89s]  Shove those bone dragons up your ass. You fucking dick. I don't even know if this is winnable.
[22697.00s -> 22699.64s]  Maybe I shouldn't even go after him. I'm not sure I can even do this.
[22700.28s -> 22721.51s]  Let me try one thing. Let's see. Hold on. Okay. I'm talking about potentially. What about like an
[22721.51s -> 22734.97s]  elemental? A berserk implosion. This does 577 damage. I could implode the dragon which would
[22734.97s -> 22747.61s]  take like five or six of them away. Maybe like four? Five? Three. All right. It's very clear
[22747.61s -> 22756.09s]  that the dragons have to die. So what? Okay. 150, 2550, 250, 40 to 50. I might just do dragon to
[22756.09s -> 22777.08s]  dragon here. I'm gonna die but maybe I should hold back. No. The dragon's gonna fly over here.
[22780.82s -> 22785.94s]  If I leave him. I mean I'm gonna sacrifice this dragon right now essentially. Five versus 16. They
[22785.94s -> 22795.19s]  have more HP but I mean maybe I'll really kill a couple. Let's just see what happens. 16, 13,
[22795.19s -> 22802.60s]  four. All right. This is not a bad strategy so far. I'm gonna berserk this guy right here probably
[22802.60s -> 22817.29s]  or this one. I'm not going anywhere yet. Berserk the trident probably then. Undead spell. Well the
[22817.29s -> 22827.42s]  last time I did undead spell it only killed one person. Remember I tried it already and it only
[22827.42s -> 22836.15s]  killed like it only took away one person. It affects everybody. We'll see. Let me try it.
[22838.34s -> 22843.46s]  Um I don't think I want to go in with anybody right now but what's the what's the play here?
[22843.46s -> 22862.17s]  I wonder. I'm not sure I go in. They're gonna attack the dragon but I could go after the uh
[22862.17s -> 22875.53s]  the unicorns. 110, 18, 22. Let's see if I. I'm just going in for the vampires.
[22876.09s -> 22884.44s]  It sounds like clan. 57, 48. All right now I've got the genie. The genie should really buff up
[22884.44s -> 22913.69s]  the ranged. That sucks. I need to be. Well let's just do this. Frenzy. Good. I'm just gonna move up.
[22914.49s -> 22928.20s]  Of course you do that. No dude. No. No way. No way. I have to berserk somebody at the very beginning.
[22929.08s -> 22932.94s]  Otherwise this is. I will never win this in a million years.
[22940.42s -> 22949.93s]  Somebody has to get berserked immediately. Let's see what I can do here.
[22955.11s -> 22959.59s]  It could be possible if I berserk somebody right at the start. Let's see. Let me try it now.
[22960.71s -> 22963.75s]  Let me put because this might be a wash. Let's do the undead thing.
[22964.71s -> 22982.22s]  Destroy undead. I don't think it killed anybody. Nobody died. So everybody's saying I had to do
[22982.22s -> 23000.28s]  that. I hope you see what happened. These guys are actually the bad. I wonder if I berserk.
[23004.23s -> 23007.91s]  Let me see who I can even berserk because I'll try that at the beginning. This is too much.
[23008.79s -> 23023.61s]  What level is this hero? Destroyed. All right. God damn it. He's so powerful. It's not fair how
[23023.61s -> 23038.68s]  powerful you are. You shouldn't be this powerful. Okay. Berserk the tree. I can berserk the unicorn
[23039.40s -> 23051.69s]  or I can berserk the treant. Nobody else can be berserked. The trees will last a lot longer but
[23051.69s -> 23061.13s]  the unicorn might do more. Let's try the unicorn. It worked. All right. Now. Now I'm going for the
[23061.13s -> 23075.80s]  dragon. Unicorn's also going to go for the dragon. Or do I just not move? Just nobody move?
[23076.60s -> 23101.51s]  Should I buff him? Nobody move. Everybody just sit here. Did he cleanse it? No. No, this is no way.
[23101.51s -> 23109.08s]  This is impossible. There's only one way this is possible and I need to get like 25 dragons.
[23110.20s -> 23136.55s]  This is unwinnable. I have to just turtle for five weeks. It's not doable. I got it. I was so
[23136.55s -> 23141.99s]  overconfident too. That's the worst part about this. He's going to get this town again.
[23145.56s -> 23151.48s]  All right. I need a dragon. We're going to meet in the middle here. We're going to do a dragon trade.
[23154.36s -> 23175.86s]  What do I have? I have five dragons. Honestly, I need to like maybe I could win from the castle.
[23175.86s -> 23186.79s]  No, because the dragon can just fly over it. How many dragons can I have here now? There's two there.
[23188.44s -> 23201.82s]  I have two that can be recruited. Two on him. So two, four. I'll have like nine dragons.
[23202.54s -> 23217.46s]  Get some more archers. Get more of these. More pegasus. Do I not have the upgraded ones?
[23218.02s -> 23226.18s]  I could get more of these too. Just get them just to get them. Okay. So I have two more dragons.
[23226.90s -> 23230.41s]  If he's going to take this. What do I do with the guys that are here right now?
[23232.06s -> 23246.58s]  You're just going to. I mean, I may as well. I'm so screwed. I'm just going to have to go back
[23246.58s -> 23259.75s]  down here and just get more. Admit defeat? Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. I'm not done yet. I still
[23259.75s -> 23265.99s]  have plenty of property. I just need to get to the right spot. I can trade some units here.
[23266.95s -> 23271.35s]  I have a lot of this guy can just be like a good unit trader. I've conquered all this over here.
[23274.63s -> 23285.90s]  He's going to go take the castle. Whatever. Take it. I don't care. There he goes. He'll get it.
[23285.90s -> 23297.88s]  Whatever. Nineteen bone dragons. I saw you like less than two weeks ago. Motherfucker. I can't
[23297.88s -> 23303.98s]  believe. Well, I could do. This is a good opportunity to just. Maybe I can wipe up some
[23303.98s -> 23321.05s]  unicorns. What level are you? The computer just like gave him all this random shit. He didn't do
[23321.05s -> 23339.00s]  anything for this. He just. They gave him to him. Well, here's the thing. He might leave some of
[23339.00s -> 23343.40s]  these here, which is a good thing. Maybe I can. I might be just. Maybe I'll just be able to turn
[23343.40s -> 23352.14s]  around. You know, you like leave the vampires and the fucking. Okay. Whatever. What do you leave
[23352.14s -> 23364.86s]  there? All right. He left some. He left a bunch of shit here. He left the unicorns. He left his
[23364.86s -> 23386.01s]  trance. No, he still has so many. Not worth it. Stick with the plan. Stick to the plan. Come here.
[23387.85s -> 23403.53s]  Seven dragons. More centaurs. I need to upgrade these pegasuses. Do I not have it? Can I? I
[23403.53s -> 23417.26s]  waste my treasure reef. Silver pegasi. There it is. I want to upgrade these too. I need to upgrade
[23417.26s -> 23423.18s]  the archers. I'm going to just sit down here and fucking turtle. He's blocked off the path of escape.
[23423.18s -> 23428.30s]  Well, this is my final stand. If I'm dead, then I'm dead. And it was really fun. This game's fucking
[23428.30s -> 23435.53s]  awesome. So if this is it, this is it. If he's like, he's like fucking coming down here to kill me,
[23438.14s -> 23446.33s]  then that's it. And I'll have to just say, well, what do you know? Oh well. No, here he comes.
[23447.85s -> 23454.01s]  He's coming down here. He's coming to get us. We have to everybody. I'm parking him in the front.
[23455.06s -> 23459.86s]  Yeah. I'm going to be inside. And then this, uh, Kalad guy is going to be standing at the front door.
[23459.86s -> 23489.05s]  Okay. Nine dragons, 116 archers, 293 centaurs, 58, 16, 38. Like this is, this is so ridiculous.
[23489.05s -> 23496.81s]  Like I have to be able to put up a defense. The genies instead of, I need genies instead of the
[23496.81s -> 23505.99s]  dwarfs. You could recruit heroes across the map and start a new era and conquer the other dudes.
[23506.87s -> 23514.94s]  Yeah. But I have like a personal vendetta right now. Can anything else be upgraded?
[23515.58s -> 23524.30s]  Treasury, 10% interest, fortune, luck of the garrison and the hero by two. Let's do it.
[23524.86s -> 23538.89s]  They're coming in. So let's trade with you. You can take the dwarfs. I will take the pegasus. I
[23538.89s -> 23572.04s]  will take these. Okay. Go back in there. Unicorns. Okay. Now I think he's back to you. Okay. Get back
[23572.04s -> 23589.78s]  in here. Get up here. Hold on. I need to like switch this out. This is such a joke. I can't
[23589.78s -> 23600.65s]  believe I'm doing this. All right. Well, here we go. I've got, this is my army. He's going to be
[23600.65s -> 23608.04s]  outside 119. This is just, he's just here. I also have this still, but it's the only other thing I
[23608.04s -> 23626.22s]  got. Park yourself in here. Almost 10 dragons. So I have so many people. Like I just got to stay
[23626.22s -> 23631.11s]  behind the walls and just try to fight. Can you put both in the castle? I don't think you can.
[23632.60s -> 23642.01s]  I mean, no, he could just stand right outside the door. Okay. Here comes our inevitable defeat.
[23648.86s -> 23661.29s]  Let him in the castle and then run away with the teleport spell. But then I would just go all the
[23661.29s -> 23668.22s]  way back and it repeats again. And then I just have to go like, what's even blue doing? This is
[23668.22s -> 23675.75s]  orange is only place. I don't think this guy's moved. Has orange moved the whole, I don't think
[23675.75s -> 23688.71s]  he can leave. He can't even leave. He's just over here. God damn it. Well, whatever. It was, it was
[23688.71s -> 23717.85s]  fun. Let's see what happens. Red is still a player. Here he comes. Okay. There he goes. Three. I got
[23717.85s -> 23734.23s]  one Titan here. It's possible that I could make it to week seven. Look at all the purple. Purple
[23734.23s -> 23744.81s]  had nothing. Like a week ago. And now all of a sudden you have everything. Did you just do
[23744.81s -> 23774.23s]  something over here? Like tan died and you picked up all the houses for free. I already know what
[23774.23s -> 23787.62s]  that did. It's inevitable. Maybe he'll go this way and I can buy a few more dragons. I want to
[23787.62s -> 23796.81s]  like start over the scenario. Here comes the other guy. Oh, this is, this is the, this is,
[23796.81s -> 23802.76s]  it's over. This is my other stronghold. I'm about to be wiped out. I'm actually about to
[23802.76s -> 23816.04s]  be completely removed from the game. Quick kill the king. Throw a bolt at the king's head.
[23816.60s -> 23825.46s]  I've been restarting my scenario because I suck at this game. Oh man. I mean, it's, it's a pretty,
[23827.05s -> 23841.64s]  it's not, the game's not necessarily easy. That is a lot of fun though. How do they have these units?
[23842.28s -> 23849.70s]  I don't know. He came into a fucking like trust or something. Somehow he, maybe when he, you know
[23849.70s -> 23856.17s]  what might've happened? So you know I said tan was defeated. He may have just stumbled upon tan's
[23856.17s -> 23861.05s]  last building and then took all of tan's money because tan, I figured it out. This is what happened.
[23861.85s -> 23869.06s]  So tan wasn't doing anything all game. It was just stockpiling money and stockpiling resources.
[23869.62s -> 23874.18s]  So he took over tan because tan was just a fucking moron. It was like walking in circles.
[23874.98s -> 23879.06s]  And took all of his money and all of his stuff like Monopoly style and then just built like
[23879.06s -> 23888.01s]  30 dragons. I think that's what happened. I think, like that was fucking absurd.
[23892.90s -> 23903.51s]  Why didn't I do that? I mean this is my first game coming back from, you know, a while. Purple.
[23905.11s -> 23915.34s]  I can feel, yes! Okay. My last stand is now higher. I can get more dragons. 10 dragons.
[23916.17s -> 23927.13s]  That's all I can afford. Wait, I can sell all my resources. Okay, hold on. Okay, I want money.
[23927.13s -> 23934.09s]  I'm willing to give you this. Wow, this is bad. No, I need those. What do I need for dragon?
[23935.13s -> 23941.74s]  Crystals. I need two crystals. I have two crystals. It's time to like, I'm liquidating.
[23947.99s -> 23957.00s]  No, no. Get, here. I'm gonna liquidate my entire, uh, yeah. It's liquidation time. This is it.
[23957.72s -> 23965.77s]  He's knocking on my front door. I'm the last remaining Monopoly player. 40. Sell gold for
[23965.77s -> 23976.23s]  gold. What? Wood. Look at how bad of a trade-off this is. I'm the last remaining fucking Monopoly
[23976.23s -> 24009.90s]  player. I'm gonna at least give a go out with a bang. 11 dragons. 88. I have fucking 323 of
[24009.90s -> 24028.94s]  these. That has to be worth something. No more money. Liquidate everything else. Just liquidate
[24028.94s -> 24038.95s]  everything. I have to. It's over. This is the end. If I win, then I beat the, I beat the hardest
[24038.95s -> 24054.14s]  fucking guy on the map. We'll see. What can I buy? Treants, probably. It's probably better.
[24055.67s -> 24071.06s]  Yep. That's it. I have 100 bucks. I have 101 dollars. Good luck, everybody. This is our final
[24071.06s -> 24086.71s]  stand. Here we go. Blue and red have just been fighting. This is what happens in these games.
[24086.71s -> 24105.16s]  And here it comes. And he walked by us. He's just toying with me. I have zero resources. I have
[24105.16s -> 24121.67s]  nothing. Just come over here and fight me. Engage him. Fight the open battle with this guy. This is
[24121.67s -> 24137.46s]  gonna be embarrassingly awful. If I can kill. You wanna know what the plan here is? You wanna know
[24137.46s -> 24147.08s]  exactly what I'm doing? The plan is, try to at least get rid of one or two bone dragons. That's
[24147.08s -> 24173.13s]  it. I can't even cast these. You guys level one. I like fucked it up from the very beginning.
[24174.94s -> 24179.26s]  It's alright though. Like, it's the first time I've played in a while. You know,
[24179.26s -> 24185.34s]  sometimes you just gotta learn. This is a seven hour learning experience. Good. Come over here.
[24186.65s -> 24204.10s]  Send in the dwarves. All I care about is just hurting this dragon. Kill one. Yes. Okay, he got
[24204.10s -> 24213.02s]  one. Try to get a couple more. Just try. Get this down to like 15. And then I got like 11 dragons.
[24214.54s -> 24225.35s]  Fine, come up here. Ooh, that's pretty good. 17. It's getting... did a good job. I just realized
[24225.35s -> 24246.01s]  that was a hare. Is that hare? That's alright. He lost two dragons. This is a castle, right? Yes.
[24246.57s -> 24267.78s]  Okay. I just was making sure. It's time. Can we hold this off? I ain't coming out. No, no, he sent
[24267.78s -> 24280.33s]  it in his shitty. It's her again. They're like, look at, they're just like, they're just so fun
[24280.33s -> 24303.02s]  together. This is my final castle. Come on. Bring it. Do it. Do it. End me. End my misery.
[24303.02s -> 24314.31s]  I'm getting out. Let's go. I'm killing her. You're fucking dead. And this time I'm killing her. You
[24314.31s -> 24316.79s]  know what I mean? Like, if there's one thing I'm going to do, I'm going to make sure, I'm going to
[24316.79s -> 24325.19s]  make sure that she's dead. Going for the fucking dwarves immediately. Instakill. No. You know what?
[24325.19s -> 24332.50s]  Fucking... what do I want to do here? This is going to be embarrassing. It is going to be awful.
[24333.94s -> 24339.37s]  Just inferno. No, I don't want to spend that many points. I don't even need to do that. The dragon
[24339.37s -> 24361.66s]  will kill them all in one hit. Don't let her run. Let's kill the archers and then buff. Don't not
[24361.66s -> 24367.98s]  retreat. Please let me just have one victory. Let me like kill your wife or your friend.
[24371.42s -> 24379.27s]  Dead. Now we can turn around. I got you. I got your feet. Warn on the feet. This item increases
[24379.27s -> 24388.04s]  your knowledge and power by plus one. Leveled up. More damage sorcery. What are you gonna say
[24388.04s -> 24396.98s]  about that? Huh? What are you gonna do about it? What are you gonna do about it? A whole lot of
[24396.98s -> 24418.26s]  nothing. Is it on? I put it on. I'm out though. Maybe now he's gonna turn around. No, he's not
[24418.26s -> 24426.92s]  turning around yet. He's leaving. No. Why are you leaving? Don't do this to me. Fuck. I'm just,
[24426.92s -> 24434.63s]  am I gonna, you know what? I got a better idea. I'm abandoning my home next week.
[24436.15s -> 24458.52s]  God damn it. What do I do? I just, I thought that was gonna be it. Um, I'm gonna go kill Orange.
[24460.66s -> 24467.93s]  Orange is dead. Watch this shit. You ready? I'm gonna, I'm gonna wipe out Orange right now.
[24477.64s -> 24494.04s]  I think I can do it. And I'm gonna take all of his money. Let's get in there.
[24496.92s -> 24510.82s]  We're going for, if I can't kill Purple, I'm going for Orange. Berserk. Berserk on the manticores.
[24511.38s -> 24519.22s]  I'm gonna win. I'm gonna take this castle. And I'm gonna sit here for fucking a year.
[24522.01s -> 24538.84s]  Just you wait. Just get the dragon in now. Everybody get in. Get in now. Everybody get in.
[24542.02s -> 24552.52s]  Don't give him a second. Buff. Manticore. Oh, what's that? Now you're gonna fight the dragon, huh?
[24554.46s -> 24573.78s]  Dead. Good, they're killing each other. Thank god. Okay. How many dragons do I have left? Get
[24573.78s -> 24590.81s]  them up here. Archers to, who's that? I can't see who's up here. The minotaurs. Or the, who's left?
[24591.54s -> 24602.68s]  Or maybe the, um, Medusas, yeah. I can't get in though. That door's gonna open.
[24610.42s -> 24616.81s]  Give me all his money. What do we think? Maybe I should kill the Medusas or should I go right
[24616.81s -> 24637.43s]  for the minotaur? Minotaur. 12 minotaurs dead. I'm gonna berserk somebody else. Berserk on the,
[24638.31s -> 24645.93s]  I wonder who I should do this to. Probably the manticore again. Or on the minotaurs. They
[24645.93s -> 24658.23s]  haven't attacked yet. Or on the lich? I can't. He's undead. I can't. You can't do it on undead.
[24658.95s -> 24664.89s]  Maybe the Medusas. Or maybe the Harpies and they'll fly over and just kill themselves.
[24669.53s -> 24676.54s]  Or, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm gonna, I'm gonna implode. I'm just gonna obliterate completely.
[24677.42s -> 24687.40s]  Always implode. Implosion on, um, on the manticore. Just melt them. There we go. Okay, great. Good,
[24687.40s -> 24703.86s]  good, good. Minotaur, attack. Six minotaurs dead. I just burnt my own people. I got this. I'm gonna
[24703.86s -> 24739.34s]  win. Okay, I get to go again. Do it twice. I can't get in there. I can't go anywhere. Get the dragon
[24739.34s -> 24764.84s]  out. He's, I can't. How many dragons? Five? Versus five? No, kill him. I can do it. Okay, I'm gonna
[24764.84s -> 24779.51s]  get him out. Bad move. No, you can go back. Okay, hold on. Kill the minotaurs. Where's resurrect?
[24780.57s -> 24808.06s]  Resurrection. I can't do it to the dragon. I'm gonna implode again. I can't do it to anybody.
[24808.70s -> 24826.55s]  I should have left the fucking dragon in. I should have left the dragon inside. How many
[24826.55s -> 24835.34s]  left? Five? There's only one more minotaur left. Kill it. I can't even get in here.
[24840.90s -> 24868.07s]  I got this. I'm gonna win. All right, it's open. Dragon to manticore. This manticore has to die.
[24879.24s -> 24891.67s]  How many points left? 69 points. Implode. It's all right. The dragon's fine because everything's
[24891.67s -> 24916.87s]  fine. I can't move. I have to kill this manticore right now with my dragon. These walls have to
[24916.87s -> 24936.14s]  collapse. Manticore. Got it. I win. I have to win. I win. Go in with the genie.
[24950.62s -> 24957.38s]  I get the dragon still in here. I can't get in, unfortunately. There's nothing I can do.
[24969.99s -> 24982.89s]  Burn. 29 harpies dead. 22 harpies dead. That's so close, but the others can't do anything.
[24982.89s -> 25005.38s]  Implode. I don't have any more points. I only have four. Magic arrow. I'm gonna take it.
[25005.38s -> 25044.44s]  Hopefully this is all of orange. 15, 1, game over. Ah, fuck. He's too big. I got
[25044.44s -> 25061.48s]  17,000 experience. Oh my god. I got torso of legion and spell scroll. This item when
[25061.48s -> 25066.68s]  equipped by a hero in a town increases the growth of your fourth level units by three per week.
[25068.94s -> 25074.46s]  And this scroll contains the dimension door spell, which is added into your spell book for as long
[25074.46s -> 25089.27s]  as you carry the scroll. More experience. Yeah. Expert sorcery. 15% more damage. Yes.
[25091.26s -> 25100.60s]  Orange has been vanquished. I killed him. He was stuck here. What did I get? Did I get anything?
[25100.60s -> 25108.07s]  I killed orange. He was just sitting here. What do I get for killing orange? I beat him. I won.
[25113.43s -> 25139.50s]  I did it. I killed orange. I don't get anything. Uh, 224 skeletons. I still have this house. Who's
[25139.50s -> 25166.41s]  in here? There's nobody here. Uh, now what? Orange's gone. Tana's gone. Now I'm the new orange.
[25169.02s -> 25187.19s]  Oh, I see. Because I can't leave. That's why he was up here for so long. Because he ran out of places.
[25187.75s -> 25192.01s]  So he didn't have another castle and he was stuck here.
[25197.69s -> 25203.77s]  That's fucking hilarious. So I actually just went up here for no reason because orange didn't give
[25203.77s -> 25213.59s]  me anything for losing. And he was actually just stuck here for eternity. All right. What's the
[25213.59s -> 25225.93s]  spell? Let's see what it is. Visions. Uh, what was it called? The dimension something. I think it
[25226.01s -> 25234.84s]  has to be my inventory. Oh, let's just put it on. So it's on. So what is it called?
[25238.14s -> 25245.26s]  Dimension door. Once per day, you may teleport your hero to a visible unoccupied location on
[25245.26s -> 25262.84s]  the map. Hey, was it worth it? You tell me at this point, because I, um, I absolutely would not have
[25262.84s -> 25272.50s]  gotten the dimension door. Rolled up your fourth level units by three per week. Here's your eagle
[25272.50s -> 25278.44s]  eye skill. I feel like, I don't, I feel like this is much better. What eagle eye skill by 10%.
[25279.56s -> 25291.42s]  I'll put this on. I want more growth or extra spell points per day. This is really good. This
[25291.42s -> 25303.46s]  is really good. That's really good. All right. As the new orange, I'm going to turtle here.
[25303.46s -> 25315.38s]  This training is going to be like fucking very long. What do we have in here? Man of vortex.
[25316.02s -> 25332.50s]  I don't have any resources though, guys. This place sucks. How the fuck did you not upgrade any of
[25332.50s -> 25347.38s]  this? You were sitting here for like three months. You didn't upgrade anything. What an idiot. So
[25347.38s -> 25359.00s]  I'm just going to teleport and take stuff and teleport back. Finally something worthy. I shall
[25359.00s -> 25364.97s]  send word immediately to the border guard that you'll be allowed to pass. Okay. All right. So
[25364.97s -> 25369.90s]  I'm going to take this dickhead and we're going to go resource hunting. That's all you are for
[25369.90s -> 25380.36s]  is just to get resources. Even as a one a day, you can just kind of chill in the tent. No, wait a
[25380.36s -> 25397.54s]  minute. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I can teleport. I'm going to teleport over here. Oh my God. Fuck.
[25406.44s -> 25419.75s]  13, not enough. All right. Just, I'm going to look at all this shit that purple has now.
[25419.75s -> 25430.10s]  This is not, I'll never win. Look at the map. I don't even know what's over here.
[25432.07s -> 25445.38s]  Purple has everything. He's got like a bunch of, look at all the, his heroes now.
[25446.66s -> 25449.38s]  He's got like five heroes. All of them have dragons.
[25451.21s -> 25463.14s]  A lot, lots of bone dragons. It's not a pack anymore. There's probably 30 dragons there now.
[25463.86s -> 25477.56s]  I will, there's no way I can win this. I mean, okay. You remember World of Warcraft 3,
[25478.68s -> 25483.08s]  how you would play that person online, that you would wipe them out and you'd be clearly,
[25483.08s -> 25490.15s]  you're going to win the game. Very clearly. You won. And they build like five farms in random
[25490.15s -> 25500.55s]  places on the map. That's what I'm doing. I still have a gold mine and a town hall that I built just
[25500.55s -> 25516.49s]  to be an asshole, just somewhere. And he's just looking for me. Run out the clock from five months
[25517.13s -> 25525.72s]  we've been doing this. And this is just on, well, okay. What's it on? It's on the normal difficulty
[25525.72s -> 25536.86s]  with like a 30% like increase in difficulty on the actual game, right? There's still imps over
[25536.86s -> 25574.20s]  here. I lose. I'm not going to be able to do this. I can make some more dragons, but I don't,
[25575.16s -> 25584.74s]  I could just make dragons and I don't have enough money. It's over. I lose. I lose. I lose. There's
[25584.74s -> 25603.61s]  nothing I can do. He has so much. I didn't even get to have my last stand. Here he comes. He's
[25603.61s -> 25621.99s]  about to put me in perpetual fucking nightmare mode. Run. Run away. Don't. Oh, he's going to,
[25621.99s -> 25625.35s]  he's trying to stick me in purgatory, but he doesn't know that I can teleport. You don't know
[25625.35s -> 25675.42s]  shit. 260 points. Are you ready for this? Asshole. Get the castle. Mine. And going down. In fact,
[25675.42s -> 25679.42s]  I'm going to teleport tomorrow and take another one. I'm going to teleport over here and then I'm
[25679.42s -> 25696.70s]  going to teleport like over here. Well, I have to be able to see it. Nevermind. I'm going to get
[25696.70s -> 25706.34s]  a ball. What? What? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah. How did you get that? There was nobody
[25706.34s -> 25718.81s]  there. There wasn't anyone even there. That's so stupid. Oh, God damn it. He's stuck. He's stuck.
[25720.09s -> 25728.73s]  It's there. He's not going to be able to get out. He's not going to be able to leave. I have a
[25728.73s -> 25736.78s]  chance. He's got all of his best units here. I'm going to fucking win the game. Boys and girls,
[25736.78s -> 25750.97s]  let's go. I'm ready. I'm fucking pumped right now. All right. Let's go. Pick up some resources
[25750.97s -> 25764.38s]  along the way. He can't leave. Go get all the land back. He's just going to pack a few, a few
[25764.38s -> 25791.94s]  lots pack. You should tele-frag them. Give me the dragons. Hold on. Let's see what happens.
[25792.58s -> 25800.55s]  Is there a way that I can make them all go in the portal? Blue has finally made it over here.
[25816.15s -> 25822.94s]  Oh shit. Fuck it. Yeah, take over all this stuff. Fight each other. Kill them. You fight down there
[25822.94s -> 25828.97s]  while I take everything up top. I'm going to do this very slowly. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[25830.17s -> 25848.92s]  Take it all. Then I'm going to know what I'm doing. Here he goes. This is awesome. I'm so happy right
[25848.92s -> 25866.20s]  now. What else can I take going this way? I can get the sulfur. Yep. Okay. Keep going.
[25866.92s -> 25889.43s]  Why are you coming down to me? Why are you going down to me? Uh-oh. Teleport. This, I can't
[25892.07s -> 25914.71s]  so stupid. He's got nothing in there. Where is he? He's up there. Oh, it's blue.
[25914.71s -> 25923.45s]  No, I needed these dragons. I was going to come back and get them. Um,
[25923.45s -> 25943.51s]  Vexant Icebolt. He has all, I think, the best units, at least top tier units, all in each slot.
[25944.07s -> 25964.79s]  It's all, they all can fly. Might as well, um, just go out the front door.
[25965.83s -> 25969.91s]  Meet them all in the open field. It's not like I can do about this.
[25970.55s -> 25981.54s]  Maybe I can take out one or two, but it don't matter. He's got some cool monsters, though.
[25987.64s -> 26006.34s]  One dwarf. Why is it one, one, one, one? This seems weird. The thing is, though, when I had my
[26006.34s -> 26013.46s]  original, my like 11 dragons, my 300 centaurs, I probably could have done this. This would have
[26013.46s -> 26024.33s]  been a good fight. I would have won without much of a problem. It was just purple. Purple somehow
[26025.21s -> 26067.69s]  just amassed a fortune, amassed a ton of money. Well, kill the genies. Yes, we're back home.
[26068.49s -> 26089.83s]  Genie versus genie. Good attack of dragon mistake. I have 245 skeletons, though.
[26091.03s -> 26110.20s]  Maybe I'll get lucky and I will get like a thousand skeletons, right? Two thousand experience.
[26110.20s -> 26116.82s]  Got my capital back, what's in here? All right, I can get it. I can get some titans, I think.
[26122.15s -> 26132.76s]  Two titans. I can get some more of these. What else? Genies? No genies.
[26133.32s -> 26156.15s]  I can fill up on these. 45. I could get a bunch of these. No, I've got one titan. What do you got?
[26156.15s -> 26166.90s]  Few pack, several throng, lots of hoard. Guys, guys, I can beat this. I can win. I can win right
[26166.90s -> 26185.32s]  now. I can, I can kill this person right now. Go ahead, fight each other down here. Let's go.
[26185.96s -> 26193.48s]  You got nothing. What do you got? I'm just, I'm going right. We're not wasting a second.
[26193.48s -> 26210.06s]  I'm gonna obliterate. Where is it? I have so many spells. Where is obliterate? Where is it?
[26210.06s -> 26235.26s]  Obliterate. Implosion, not obliterate. You know what I'm saying. Obliterate. Ares is stuck in
[26235.26s -> 26240.10s]  the corner. I might actually be able to do this as long as I can, like, kind of...
[26241.06s -> 26252.20s]  Why am I flocking with the archer? I'm losing it. I'm losing my fucking mind.
[26258.02s -> 26265.69s]  Okay, that's pretty good. Pretty good, pretty good, pretty good. All right, so now let's take it back
[26265.69s -> 26275.61s]  this way. I've got some titans. I've got, I can, I'm gonna teleport this and watch this shit. I'm
[26275.61s -> 26279.53s]  gonna teleport over here and then I'm gonna go down and I'm gonna get blue and I'm gonna get
[26279.53s -> 26283.69s]  fucking red. I'm gonna kill red. Listen to me. What's wrong with me? I'm like fucking freaking out.
[26284.57s -> 26318.74s]  He's turning mad. That's great. Okay, would like to recruit gremlins? No, just, this is all I got.
[26328.22s -> 26335.94s]  Yeah, blue is, I have to scoop up. I gotta go around. I have to scoop up. I'm not gonna leave
[26335.94s -> 26353.06s]  this place undefended. This one is, all right, hold on a minute. I need money. He can't do anything.
[26353.06s -> 26367.48s]  He's fucked. He's screwed. This is perfect. That's so awesome. More crystals. All right,
[26367.48s -> 26388.14s]  let me get the lumberyard. This is so stupid. Uh oh. They're getting in their boats. All right,
[26388.14s -> 26393.98s]  I got all the resources. Now let's get over here and I'm gonna teleport this way.
[26394.70s -> 26400.89s]  Although, how am I doing on, I feel like I should, I'm gonna get some more genies.
[26403.19s -> 26419.40s]  I'm gonna get four titans. More of these. Let's not rush here. Hold on. I can't believe I've done this
[26419.40s -> 26431.50s]  camp. This is like random campaign for fucking seven and a half hours. Should I just farm titans?
[26431.50s -> 26450.38s]  266 skeletons. Three more mages. Yeah, I'm just gonna sit out here, man. I'm gonna be the biggest
[26450.38s -> 26455.96s]  piece of shit ever. I'm gonna be the biggest fucking piece of crap ever. I'm just gonna skip
[26455.96s -> 26476.31s]  every single turn. What is gonna speed click? Purple on land? Uh, he's dead. Archers,
[26476.95s -> 26504.31s]  hoard a pet. You're dead. Get over here. Let's go. I'll kill you all. He's coming up. Okay, he's
[26504.31s -> 26581.86s]  dead. I got better dragons. Berserk on the dragon. Kill the archers. Get the fuck out of here.
[26582.74s -> 26590.49s]  I just burnt the fucking tent down.
[26595.37s -> 26603.46s]  I win. Slowly but surely, I'm going to kill all of purple and I'm gonna win.
[26604.36s -> 26629.77s]  It's a war of attrition at this point. I'm gonna win. I'm gonna get a balcony pick with a handsome
[26629.77s -> 26669.74s]  guy. Remember, are you seriously bringing another guy over here? Several packs, several fused,
[26669.74s -> 26684.23s]  several. They keep respawning and coming back to me. This is fucking awesome. I need more money
[26684.23s -> 26692.79s]  though. My resources aren't terrible. All right, here's what I'm gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna go.
[26692.79s -> 26698.26s]  That came out of nowhere. I'm gonna come over. I'm gonna teleport over here. I'm going this way
[26698.98s -> 26717.34s]  and I'm gonna go swoop by red. I still have a ton of units. I'm one more week and then I'm
[26717.34s -> 26732.14s]  gonna teleport over there. Somebody's coming over here though. Oh, they have to fucking do
[26732.14s -> 26741.30s]  that right now. It's this guy. I can't, I don't know if I can leave yet because if I teleport here,
[26741.30s -> 26757.40s]  I can swoop around. I don't even have this viewed. Stupid tax bullshit. No, I gotta wait another day.
[26764.84s -> 26776.87s]  Here you come. Here you come. Okay, I gotta be ready for this. What do you think? Two titans and
[26776.87s -> 26800.92s]  then replace the skeletons. I need, I don't have any money. I need two crystal, I need, okay, I need
[26800.92s -> 26808.28s]  two like nerds. 5,000. 5,000 gold. I have, I need, all right, okay, here we go. I'm gonna sell some
[26808.28s -> 26820.81s]  shit. Where's the market here? Down here? What the fuck is it? Artifact merchant? What the hell is this?
[26821.69s -> 26834.73s]  Defense, growth, cot, mercury. No. Where's the merchant down here? Did he fucking have one?
[26835.69s -> 26848.41s]  Am I insane? Where is it? Okay, I want this. I'll give you crystals.
[26885.11s -> 26895.16s]  All right, this is a good troop of people. I need a capital too. Fuck, I do. You're right. I gotta
[26895.16s -> 26919.54s]  kill this person though. They keep sending them up here. What is that? A behemoth? Target enemy's
[26919.54s -> 26931.53s]  defense is reduced by 40%. This is like a chad orc. Not that scary actually. Just go for the
[26932.25s -> 26942.89s]  berserk on the behemoth. Why are they on his legs? Got it, okay, and then we're gonna go right over
[26942.89s -> 26967.64s]  to the magi's. No, yeah, no, that's too close. Down here, the birds. One hit kill. Buff, buff.
[26968.84s -> 26990.54s]  Nice. Titan. Up top. Wolves. Magi. Defend. Ooh, got it. I win again.
[27009.93s -> 27020.42s]  No, I need to make a citadel. Stop making people. Make some genies. All right, that's it. I need a
[27020.42s -> 27034.04s]  citadel. He keeps retreating and you're killing the useless units. Well, the units don't stick around.
[27034.68s -> 27041.93s]  5300. Does this have a citadel? It doesn't have... Okay, I need... I'm gonna have two more capitals
[27041.93s -> 27054.86s]  here. Okay, I just gotta get to 20,000 gold. Everybody leave me the fuck alone. Nobody come
[27054.86s -> 27063.93s]  up here. Purple. I just killed like three of purple's heroes. 10,000. Let's get it right here.
[27065.02s -> 27088.04s]  Capital building. 4,000 gold a day. See you next week. 8,000 now. We're getting there.
[27088.76s -> 27094.86s]  We're getting there and I'm going to stack titans. It's gonna be embarrassing how many I have. At
[27094.86s -> 27111.62s]  least 30. I gotta get the wood. I'll go with this one. It's still mine. Am I gonna do anything with
[27111.62s -> 27117.69s]  the other dude? Yes. Uh, but first I need to get that other building. I need to get a capital in
[27117.69s -> 27127.26s]  that other, uh, castle, so. Imp growth, familiar growth. So I need a capital in here. All right,
[27127.34s -> 27137.34s]  already is one. I can't build more than one capital. Oh shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. I can't do it.
[27139.94s -> 27150.04s]  Shit. Oh well. Oh shit. I don't know. Oh, I need the money though so bad.
[27161.38s -> 27171.90s]  God damn it. Two more titans. I got it. It's still going. I'm not going to bed. No, I don't care.
[27177.10s -> 27184.18s]  Oh god damn it, man. Shit, I can't believe this motherfucker is coming over after me. Oh shit.
[27189.13s -> 27201.14s]  What the fuck am I doing? I got the sulfur for free. I'm just gonna sit here and grind.
[27201.94s -> 27208.76s]  This stream is never going to end. But here's the worst part, guys. Let's say this is like a 12 hour
[27208.76s -> 27219.58s]  stream. Okay. I have to eventually go over here. Otherwise I don't win. You know, understand? I
[27219.58s -> 27230.76s]  eventually everything, all everything ends at Ares. I'm going in there with 50 titans. It's
[27230.76s -> 27238.12s]  the only way to win. I'm telling you, this is the strategy here. All right. Let me, let me hang out
[27238.12s -> 27254.54s]  in here. That's eight titans. I just need money. Look at how much stuff this area to buy. Get the
[27254.54s -> 27275.83s]  reveal map spell? Do I even have one? Oh, it's tax day. Bullshit. Lookout tower. I don't have five
[27275.83s -> 27292.07s]  wood. I have to go on an expedition. It's inevitable. I have to. Anybody up here? I
[27292.07s -> 27310.81s]  don't see anybody up here. I have to go on an expedition. I'm teleporting over here. I can
[27310.81s -> 27325.48s]  always go back. Puzzle pieces. Witch hut. Okay, we got a rally point. Lock up. A thousand experience
[27325.48s -> 27351.59s]  right here. Oh! Uh oh. He ain't gonna come at me. That's the other guy that's really strong.
[27352.15s -> 27357.98s]  No, he's not here. Okay. What can I do? He's not going to come after me. I'm strong.
[27372.36s -> 27403.59s]  I want a new save. Whoa, what? Did Red just kill somebody? Did he just kill Purple?
[27404.23s -> 27416.65s]  What does he have in there? What? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what? Oh, he brought a boat.
[27416.65s -> 27426.12s]  He brought a boat. He brought a fucking boat over here. Boat. Not good. I have to turn around, I
[27426.12s -> 27433.37s]  think. But there's an island. But I've already been to this island. What are you doing? Wait,
[27433.37s -> 27440.34s]  but there's an island. Yeah, the middle island. I've been to a thousand times. No, go back. Back,
[27440.34s -> 27454.38s]  back, back, back. Ares is back. Oh my god. Okay, for a second. I thought this was 68 dragons.
[27459.06s -> 27483.53s]  I can take this. I'm thinking of implosion. Implosion on the angels or I wonder on the
[27483.53s -> 27499.05s]  zealots or the archers. Yeah, that was an absolute destructive thing that I just did. Thank god.
[27499.05s -> 27516.46s]  All right. 5200. 40 to 5250. No, I gotta I gotta whittle. I gotta blow you down.
[27517.66s -> 27535.91s]  I don't think I go anywhere. Unless me going. Damn. That was not what I thought was gonna happen.
[27536.63s -> 27561.72s]  Can I buff you? Okay, good. Magic mirror. Who do I throw this at? Angels. Oh, they can fucking fly.
[27562.52s -> 27573.00s]  This is terrible. This is really bad. Angel has to die now. Dragons are dead. I got no more dragons
[27573.00s -> 27595.02s]  anymore. They're gone. We gotta go twice. That sucks. Oh my god. I'm exiting the game. This is
[27595.02s -> 27604.02s]  not part of the plan. Not part of the plan. No, I'm not doing it. I had to fight the one dickhead
[27604.02s -> 27630.70s]  on the in the ocean. Watch this be the only thing he has. Angel's dead. Uh, those things are strong.
[27633.02s -> 27652.54s]  We got 200. Let's just go in the back here. It's gonna be good. 36. Okay, Genie.
[27653.42s -> 27657.93s]  Genie's just he's right in front of you. You have to try and you got nothing.
[27659.99s -> 27670.22s]  15 to eight. You keep going. Nice. All right, if there's something substantial that I get from this,
[27670.94s -> 27685.98s]  then I'm gonna redo it. You know, if I get like the the chest piece of immortality or something,
[27685.98s -> 27707.74s]  then maybe because I'm gonna I think I'm gonna win. Pretty good bait here. That's it for the
[27707.74s -> 27734.78s]  horses. You take care of this. That's it. 10,000 experience. Defense expert learning and nothing.
[27734.78s -> 27751.43s]  Here comes fucking Ares. Um, here's the thing though. This is I could get rid of red.
[27752.15s -> 27764.36s]  I could delete red right now. I don't think red has another castle.
[27767.94s -> 27773.21s]  This is empty. There's nothing in here. Unless unless there's something down here.
[27775.86s -> 27786.86s]  No, that's not part of the plan. Load game. This is before I even teleported over, right?
[27787.58s -> 27802.06s]  No, it's not. What the hell is going on? No, wrong one. Okay, so this is where I I'm gonna go back.
[27802.62s -> 27816.84s]  We're gonna teleport back. So then if I don't do that, let's see where the timeline is.
[27818.65s -> 27827.99s]  He still gets in the boat. Red is now here, which now red is gonna end up potentially taking this
[27827.99s -> 27841.24s]  castle. At least I got the resources. All right, teleport over here to walk. Okay, so get up here.
[27841.88s -> 27861.56s]  Back it up. Really want more dragons, but I don't think don't have any access to them.
[27862.20s -> 27874.92s]  It sucks. What do I have access to over here? Unfortunately, it's the same place. It's the same
[27874.92s -> 27889.42s]  place. It's not different. I'm gonna have to just like master gremlins, naga queens. I mean,
[27889.42s -> 27907.19s]  I'm gonna have to do something here. I could send somebody down here, but he's here. I really want
[27907.19s -> 27916.76s]  that back. There's nothing there except he's here. He's got dragons. Double of the same production
[27916.76s -> 27926.52s]  is not bad. No, that's not. Yeah, that's true. I'm gonna send a scout out next week. I'm gonna
[27926.52s -> 27944.76s]  send a scout out to try to get blue. At least that castle on the right. And I'll start him here and
[27944.76s -> 27950.50s]  get him, try to get him down here. There's nothing, there's nobody here. I can just get that back.
[27951.06s -> 27968.79s]  Or this one for day five. Still have the dragons. Titans. I'll have 10 titans. Still have all this
[27968.79s -> 27980.36s]  stuff up here. All right, let's go. Let's do that plan. Here we go. Wizard or Death Knight. He has
[27980.36s -> 27993.58s]  an artifact. What is it? What's the artifact? Knowledge and power by three. Let's give you
[27993.58s -> 28001.85s]  just a couple of these things to go out with. I will keep the other ones that are for this building
[28001.85s -> 28020.54s]  here. Go out this way. Grab a boat. Get the hell out of here. Basic scouting. This one definitely.
[28025.24s -> 28030.09s]  Arena. This is where I get some points. I'm not gonna move. I'm gonna stay here.
[28031.85s -> 28037.38s]  Oh, fuck. He's coming my way. What does he got? Is this the same red that I fought before? I beat
[28037.38s -> 28069.56s]  him. Yep, it is. All right, well, I'm getting in. I need a new hero. I might have to meet you halfway.
[28070.92s -> 28081.80s]  I think I'm gonna have to meet them halfway. Yep, I'm gonna focus the zealots. We're not on,
[28081.80s -> 28097.82s]  there's no planks here. No, I, you know, I'll make another, I'll make another hero.
[28098.62s -> 28112.66s]  And I'm gonna send this hero off. Absolutely this one. One knowledge. Okay, so then let's give you
[28112.66s -> 28117.54s]  this. I'm gonna give you something. I'll give you some something just to get this to be out there
[28117.54s -> 28135.40s]  and just be alright. Back it in here. I want you behind the walls. You need to go recruit shit.
[28136.04s -> 28144.07s]  Find your way around. Just walk by this guy. And I need to get in the boat and I'm gonna go down.
[28144.87s -> 28152.06s]  I'm gonna go down here. I want nothing to do with you, man.
[28152.06s -> 28170.25s]  All right, same deal with you. Down this way. Here we go. Let's see what happens.
[28170.25s -> 28173.13s]  He's coming in for a fight. All right, he wants to get rid of this guy. All right, well, this is
[28173.13s -> 28181.56s]  good bait. This is really good bait. I'm okay with this. It gets rid of the centaurs and it
[28181.56s -> 28198.57s]  makes him not attack the house. Everyone's just gonna die. This is wasted money. I know. Fuck,
[28198.57s -> 28212.06s]  you're right. I just... I didn't think he was gonna fucking... I thought he was gonna...
[28212.06s -> 28220.71s]  I didn't think he was gonna fucking come back and kill me. I thought he was gonna...
[28222.15s -> 28235.00s]  Okay, he's gonna go back to back. Back to back and kill everybody. Hey, remember that money that I
[28235.00s -> 28243.80s]  lost? I'm just... I got... I can't even... I shouldn't even spend any money on any other towns
[28244.76s -> 28251.00s]  because this is not possible to beat unless I have an equal or better force, which I can't do.
[28251.96s -> 28258.09s]  I can't. It's... I can't do it. I have to... I'm gonna... I don't give a shit. Just take it all.
[28259.21s -> 28276.87s]  I'm gonna just turtle the fuck out of one place and just get 25 titans and then win. Damn it.
[28277.43s -> 28289.75s]  I need to stop, like, putting money into three or four different places. I just need to do it
[28289.75s -> 28307.30s]  in one place. This whole... this same scenario is gonna play out over and over again. Or I just
[28307.30s -> 28323.53s]  lose because he keeps going to the capital. God damn it. Let's... I want to see what happens.
[28323.53s -> 28337.16s]  I made, like, three other heroes. I should have just sat in my fucking castle and just banked
[28337.16s -> 28371.11s]  money and then had, like, a bunch of people. I'm making that same mistake again. Well, the only
[28371.11s -> 28374.79s]  reason why I thought I was gonna win is because I thought Ares was stuck forever, but then it
[28374.79s -> 28383.03s]  didn't matter because then Red decided to grow a brain and move from this island to over here.
[28383.75s -> 28401.42s]  It's taken him eight hours to get here. What were you doing all this time? All right, let's see.
[28401.42s -> 28411.45s]  Let's... let's check this new scenario. Let's see what happens now. I need to, like, build this
[28411.45s -> 28418.62s]  place up. All right, this is what I was doing, right? Naga Queens. I can now make them here,
[28418.62s -> 28431.50s]  which is good. I can now get them to be made here. I'm going to do Cloud Temple. So I need
[28431.50s -> 28447.66s]  Author of Wishes. I don't have... I have no money to make anything else. What did I just say? No,
[28447.66s -> 28452.70s]  no, no, but I... but I made... I made, like, three new heroes. I spent, like, almost 10 grand on new
[28452.70s -> 28462.81s]  heroes. I'm not doing that. I'm just spent... like, I'm just trying to recruit people now. You know
[28462.81s -> 28477.48s]  what I mean? Like, see, I can have... make the genies. And now we go again. I've got a plan,
[28477.48s -> 28485.46s]  and his same scenario. He keeps coming back. All right, I can do this now. Author of Wishes,
[28485.46s -> 28496.10s]  and then we can do them here. Now I can make upgraded genies. And by the way, like, delete
[28496.10s -> 28510.66s]  this guy. What is that? What... that guy serves no purpose. All right, even more. And then we're
[28510.66s -> 28520.52s]  going to dump them together, and this guy's going to just ride his horse off a cliff, for all I care.
[28520.52s -> 28546.87s]  Okay, looks all right. Okay, let's go. Save it. Okay, here we go. So here comes Red. If I'm behind
[28546.87s -> 28559.18s]  my walls, he won't kill me. Here comes Ares. Everyone is recruited from here. This place is
[28559.18s -> 28569.42s]  looking all right. Okay, now Cloud Temple. I need 5,000 gold. I also need 10 wood, 10 ore, and 10
[28570.14s -> 28577.83s]  marbles. So I just need some wood. And then we can start generating titans here. So let's just make
[28577.83s -> 28588.07s]  as many of these as we can. I have to cash right now. I kind of have to get out here. If he... I
[28588.07s -> 28594.50s]  kind of have to get out and, like, get the wood again. All right, first of all, get in the castle,
[28594.50s -> 28600.82s]  because if he comes over to the castle, I'm going to die. So what do I do with these? I said I wasn't
[28600.82s -> 28616.87s]  going to make another hero. Do I just delete them? I think I have to just delete them. Yeah, I have
[28616.87s -> 28628.28s]  to dismiss them. I'm not going to use them. Sell them for resources. Yeah, that's a good idea.
[28629.08s -> 28646.39s]  Where is that building? Where is that building? Do I even have it here? Resource silo? No.
[28647.35s -> 28671.29s]  What is it called? Do I have it in this town? No, the tavern. Um, a blacksmith? No. I don't think I
[28671.29s -> 28676.63s]  have it here. Stronghold is the only faction that gets a building to sell units. Ah, damn it.
[28677.59s -> 28684.34s]  It's only on the orc stronghold. Well, oh well. Wait, what? What do you mean I do have it?
[28685.06s -> 28705.00s]  Where is it? No, just kidding. Thanks. Skeletons aren't worth it. Just delete the skeletons?
[28705.56s -> 28717.80s]  I feel like the skeletons can be pretty good sometimes, though. It's not worth making a new
[28717.80s -> 28722.70s]  hero and just having him just go die. I'm just gonna dismiss them. I'm just gonna dismiss them.
[28727.61s -> 28741.51s]  Three, two, one. I'm doing it. Has chap been right before? Quite a few times, actually. Yeah, they
[28741.51s -> 28751.69s]  have. They've been right before. Okay. How are we doing here? I need wood. I'm gonna take back the
[28751.69s -> 28778.71s]  fucking wood. Where is he? Go get wood. I need this. Just don't pop out of nowhere and kill me.
[28779.43s -> 28790.15s]  You know how upset I'll be if that happens? I don't have the new, the new genie, right?
[28791.54s -> 28799.56s]  I can get these guys. Okay. Starting to build a decent army on the other side here. No, no, no,
[28799.56s -> 28819.18s]  no, no, no, no. I can beat them. I'm gonna go hard on the zealots. The angels, they have so many
[28819.18s -> 28828.10s]  good fucking units. I think it's go hard on zealots. Start off with implosion on the zealots
[28833.11s -> 28853.54s]  or should I berserk? Berserk the zealots? There's so many options. Either berserk the zealots,
[28853.54s -> 28867.06s]  implode the zealots. How's their attack? 10 to 12, 7 to 10, 2 to 3, 15 to 25. I could do that.
[28868.02s -> 28884.22s]  They do way more damage. Yeah, I think I'm gonna berserk the, um, the capital right here. They do
[28884.22s -> 28892.57s]  more damage. And then I'm just gonna go hard on the zealots. With dragon and with titan.
[28910.31s -> 28916.47s]  Ah! Get out of here! You're ruining everything! Because I'm gonna deplete all my fucking forces
[28916.47s -> 28927.56s]  on this! This is like the same thing that happened. Except at a different part of the map. They just,
[28928.12s -> 28933.56s]  I just don't, I didn't do it. It was the first three hours of the game. I just didn't get
[28933.56s -> 28936.76s]  everything in the right position. I was still trying to learn and remember how to play.
[28937.48s -> 28946.50s]  And I fucking peed on myself. All right, well, get up here. I at least need to have somebody fight.
[28965.24s -> 28971.29s]  And then I'm back to square one again. And then there's two or three other people that have
[28971.93s -> 28979.24s]  huge armies. I think this is a retreat and give up. I think I'll lose here. I don't think it's
[28979.24s -> 28993.75s]  possible that I can win. Even if I beat this, I, what am I gonna do? I'm behind in troops and
[28993.75s -> 29002.42s]  resources by like a hundred percent. I can win this fight, but then we start all over again where
[29002.42s -> 29026.81s]  it's like, oh, here comes Ares with his 30 dragons. I'm fucked. Well, it was fun. Use spells? I couldn't
[29026.81s -> 29031.53s]  use spells. This is the first round I've been able to use spells up until last time. We're
[29031.53s -> 29054.57s]  going to berserk again. Let's berserk the angels, get rid of them, fight each other, kill each other.
[29055.37s -> 29076.30s]  Okay. Good. So put the skeletons. That's perfect. Very good. Go carve up the angel. This is a
[29076.30s -> 29102.02s]  victory. He's melted the skeletons. Holy shit. Kind of in trouble here. Whoa. Well, that's not good.
[29107.29s -> 29126.28s]  Angel's dead. I'm going to wrap back around here and they retreated. 10,000 experience. I used
[29126.28s -> 29135.18s]  blind. Cannot move, cause a counterattack at half its normal attack strength. Let's get expert
[29135.18s -> 29147.18s]  learning. So now I, what the hell am I going to do now? I need more Titans. Crystals back here.
[29150.26s -> 29166.98s]  Two more Titans. Oh, they can only get one. I feel like we are probably going to be in a never-ending
[29166.98s -> 29184.49s]  loop. I'm almost certain of it actually. Epic 72 hour campaign. Now I'm essentially treading water
[29184.49s -> 29193.43s]  at this point because they just has so much great stuff. I'm going to give it like another week
[29193.43s -> 29206.68s]  or a couple of weeks and we'll see. Cause I just not really generating enough money.
[29207.40s -> 29215.83s]  And if I send people, it's almost like I'm constantly swimming upstream. And I think, yeah,
[29215.83s -> 29220.78s]  I just have to, I think I just have to take somebody. I got, I'm going to get, I'll get 10
[29220.78s -> 29226.25s]  Titans. And I think I just have to, I have to go down here and just try to steal something. Just
[29226.25s -> 29235.05s]  try to get something. Let us recruit what we can recruit. And then I'm going to go from there. So
[29235.05s -> 29250.84s]  let's do it. There are 18 of these over here. So what I'm going to do, I'm, what am I going to do
[29250.84s -> 29258.22s]  here? Let's just see, let's just see what happens. We've been going for like over eight hours now.
[29258.22s -> 29265.38s]  It's probably time to wind it down. It's like midnight Pacific. I'm like too addicted to being
[29265.46s -> 29270.50s]  in a never ending circle, but it's all good. Let's do this. I'm just going to recruit
[29271.06s -> 29291.51s]  whatever's left here and then I'm going to head down. I need to wait a day. Of course it's tax day.
[29292.31s -> 29315.90s]  That's great. 10 Titans. There we go. I hate that. There's still a few more in here. I've got to
[29315.90s -> 29327.37s]  wait. I can, if I'm going to give it a real try, I'm going to wait, go until a year has passed.
[29328.09s -> 29335.86s]  That'll be like another, probably eight and a half hours. It's month six. I don't think
[29335.86s -> 29361.82s]  I'm going to do that. All right. Wizards. All right. Almost ready to go. I'm actually going to
[29361.82s -> 29373.29s]  bring the other Naga Queens over. Don't even tell me he's fucking coming to get me. Oh,
[29373.29s -> 29399.94s]  this is you motherfucker. No, let me have my, don't you dare. I need to like deliver these guys. Oh,
[29399.94s -> 29409.21s]  God damn it. I need to just deliver people to here. Just do something else for a minute.
[29411.48s -> 29417.53s]  Do not come over here. Just do anything else for fucking five seconds. One more turn. Don't even
[29417.53s -> 29438.42s]  come over here. Thank, what? Special goddamn delivery. What happened? He's got 21 dragons and
[29438.42s -> 29444.26s]  a hundred liches, a hundred trees. This was never winnable anyway. He's just progressively
[29444.26s -> 29449.14s]  gotten better and I've been treading water. No, it's not possible, but I'm going to go out with
[29449.14s -> 29452.90s]  a bang and he's going to come get me and I'll let him take the fucking castle like a goddamn.
[29467.13s -> 29485.13s]  He's unbeatable. Come on, let's do it. And end by like eight to 10 hours streamer with me being
[29485.13s -> 29506.66s]  fucking humiliated. Let's go. I'm going to sit up here. They have too many. He's right outside
[29506.66s -> 29578.41s]  the castle. This is it. It's over. He's going to take his, his cheating dragons. Is there,
[29578.41s -> 29582.25s]  is there a way after this match is over? Can I go like to a replay and see how the fuck you got
[29582.25s -> 29636.14s]  these? Why would it be a reaction? Yeah, I know. Aha. You lost a unicorn. He's not even going to
[29636.14s -> 29653.11s]  come get me, is he? All right. I'll just be a piece of shit. What are you going to do?
[29653.83s -> 29662.86s]  You're going to come get me? This is it. The last stand before I actually lose.
[29663.82s -> 29671.14s]  I lose the game. Oh, this is so sad. This is so sad to me. I was so pumped and excited.
[29671.14s -> 29678.54s]  I have to get my revenge. I have to get my revenge tomorrow. I've, I'm so sad. I'm very sad right now.
[29678.54s -> 29692.33s]  I actually really am. Damn it. I really thought I had it. Okay. All right. This is fun. This was
[29692.33s -> 29707.26s]  fun. It was. Who do I even, what do I even do here? Berserk on. I can't even do that. I have to
[29707.26s -> 29711.98s]  implode somebody or let me try one of the other. No, no, no. You know what? Let's get an earth
[29711.98s -> 29725.62s]  elemental out here. Oh, this thing sucks. Nevermind. Going for the dragon. Holy shit.
[29726.34s -> 29734.95s]  Wow. Wait a minute. Wow. That was very, very, very, very good. Should I go out there and kill
[29734.95s -> 29760.38s]  the dragon? Six dragons dead. Waste. No, he's just got too many good. I could kill, at least let me
[29760.38s -> 29790.81s]  kill the dragons. Let me just get rid of these dragons. I hate them. All right. Titans. Five
[29790.81s -> 29799.86s]  dragons perish. What's going on? Oh, you're dispelling all the mines. That's kind of ridiculous.
[29801.38s -> 29806.49s]  If I kill the bone dragons, this is a victory. There's only, there's only four left.
[29807.21s -> 29827.88s]  I win. That's a victory for me. No, not my city. Not my capital.
[29827.88s -> 29835.02s]  Oh, I want to play again. This time I'm going to do much better and I'm going to be prepared,
[29836.06s -> 29863.35s]  but not tonight. 23. I will come back stronger. There goes everything. Is that me?
[29864.63s -> 29883.59s]  No, what? They even do this to you? That sucks. Oh, no, it hurts. I'm like actually,
[29884.55s -> 29909.69s]  ugh. No, I'm not doing round two right now. I'm just going to have, I'm going to have mayhem
[29909.69s -> 29920.12s]  for tomorrow. Team alignments. No teams. Maybe we should do teams. What do you think? Tomorrow
[29920.12s -> 29936.76s]  should be like four on four. Eight teams. Large map. Cause I mean, obviously it's eight people.
[29937.64s -> 29943.05s]  I'm going to keep it at that 130%. I think that's, that's good. It's fair.
[29944.89s -> 29959.62s]  Monster strength. What was it? It was on strong and it's a random map template.
[29962.07s -> 29979.42s]  Normal water. Or should we do pre-made scenarios? You have to prove. No water means no boats to
[29979.42s -> 29987.82s]  worry about. That's true. Always build second level rebuild library. I don't know what that means.
[29988.94s -> 29999.80s]  This is all. We can do this tomorrow. We'll set it up. Uh, yeah, that's going to be it. Unfortunately,
[29999.80s -> 30009.98s]  uh, I ran around in a circle for the last like three hours, but it was still a lot of fun. It's
[30009.98s -> 30020.04s]  exactly like I remember. I have a sour taste in my mouth, but I will turn it into sweet candy
[30021.00s -> 30035.06s]  tomorrow. Going for a win tomorrow. And then after tomorrow, after tomorrow, I am going to
[30035.06s -> 30039.38s]  take a little bit of time off. I have to do my colonoscopy. I'm going to be kind of miserable
[30039.38s -> 30047.03s]  over the next few days. I'm not going to be able to eat very much, but that will be it.
[30047.03s -> 30053.24s]  I will see you tomorrow around the same time between three and four Pacific. Thank you for
[30053.24s -> 30060.89s]  watching. This was Heroes of Might Magic 3, an old favorite of mine. Hopefully you guys thought
[30060.89s -> 30065.05s]  it was fun because I know there was maybe people said, oh, maybe not. I wonder. I've never seen
[30065.05s -> 30074.06s]  that before. Is it boring? Is it not boring? But I think we definitely can do another stream on this
[30074.70s -> 30081.54s]  and we'll do it tomorrow. This game is fucking awesome. It's very fun. It's very intense
[30082.26s -> 30089.82s]  and I will see you tomorrow for the next part. Thanks again for watching. We're going to do the
[30089.82s -> 30097.43s]  bits and subs when I return because I need to use the bath. I'm not going to pee. Much love to you
[30097.43s -> 30243.78s]  if you take it off. Maybe you'll step by tomorrow. See you soon. I'll be right back. Okay, so let's go
[30243.78s -> 30256.41s]  back to a long time ago, almost a whole day away. We're going to go back to Gnarly. Thanks for the
[30256.49s -> 30264.46s]  six dollars. Gnarly 62. Thanks man. Appreciate the comfort. My pleasure. Thanks for watching.
[30265.02s -> 30277.00s]  Thank you for the six dollars. Appreciate it. Thank you. Some guy. Thanks for the 15 dollars.
[30277.00s -> 30296.62s]  I don't have any message. Here's a dog. A dog. Is it a dog running after a guy? That's not Otto.
[30297.26s -> 30306.17s]  No, it's a different dog. Show Otto. No, Otto I think is probably asleep because it's
[30306.17s -> 30318.92s]  midnight. I don't think Otto is awake at the moment. Otto attacking Ares. Nah, let Otto sleep.
[30318.92s -> 30328.17s]  Otto doesn't need to be awoken. But thank you for the 15 dollars some guy. Thanks. Appreciate the dog
[30328.17s -> 30338.55s]  run video. Thank you. Thank you warm like biscuits for the 10 bucks. 15 dollars and 10 dollars right
[30338.55s -> 30343.93s]  after earlier today. Jerm, I've been watching you since early TF2 days and I have to thank you for
[30343.93s -> 30348.09s]  all the laughs and joy you have brought me through the years. I've had pretty dark nights and your
[30348.09s -> 30358.73s]  videos always made them a little easier. So thank you. Thank you. I love Team Fortress. I loved
[30358.73s -> 30365.42s]  making YouTube videos. I'm very very happy that people enjoyed them and thought they were fun
[30365.42s -> 30371.67s]  and may have helped them forget about some shit in their life. You know what I'm saying? That's
[30374.97s -> 30378.89s]  that means a lot. Thank you for the 10 dollars. Thank you for the fucking incredibly kind message.
[30384.18s -> 30392.86s]  Much love to you. Thank you warm like biscuits. Really appreciate it. Multi trip thank you for
[30392.86s -> 30403.11s]  the three bucks. Good god this is such a geeky nerd neck game. It just made me crack my neck to
[30403.11s -> 30413.29s]  make sure that I was not sitting inappropriately. Thank you for the three dollars. Thank you Matt
[30414.17s -> 30419.29s]  P.T. or Piety for the 250. Thrilled to see you playing Heroes of Might and Magic 3. Some of my
[30419.29s -> 30424.25s]  earliest memories as a kid are sitting on my mom's lap and watching her play Might and Magic
[30424.97s -> 30430.09s]  and Heroes of Might and Magic on her computer. Then abusing the hell out of cheats when I started
[30430.09s -> 30435.53s]  playing myself since I was so bad at it. I joined right as you were complaining about losing a battle
[30435.53s -> 30441.05s]  and loaded a save to redo it. That's the German we all know and love. I want to watch from the
[30441.05s -> 30448.39s]  beginning so I'll be checking out the recording later. Keep being a cool guy. Thank you. I do have
[30448.39s -> 30454.76s]  very fond memories of this game but okay maybe we can put uh maybe tomorrow I won't do any
[30454.76s -> 30457.24s]  rewinds but I'm just trying to get back in the swing thing trying to remember how to play the
[30457.24s -> 30462.82s]  game trying to remember how things work. Now I got like a good idea of how things are working again.
[30462.82s -> 30470.50s]  It's been like 15 years. Maybe we don't do rewinds tomorrow. Maybe we just have to accept our fate.
[30471.22s -> 30474.38s]  What is the worst sound of 2019?
[30479.19s -> 30489.53s]  Fight the article that says yeah fight the article that says let me find an article fight the
[30489.53s -> 30505.61s]  article that says yeah what the fuck thank you for the 250 though appreciate it matt
[30506.33s -> 30511.14s]  Freudian weapon thanks for the three bucks cheer 300 no message thank you for three dollars
[30512.55s -> 30518.90s]  Onicus thanks for the ten dollars thank you Onicus dude just want to show a little bit of
[30518.90s -> 30522.82s]  support been watching your videos for years just starting to come to streams thank you for all the
[30522.82s -> 30533.91s]  laps thank you Onicus really appreciate the ten dollars appreciate the support thanks for watching
[30533.91s -> 30542.18s]  for that much time I'm super thankful that people years later still think that this channel is fun
[30544.50s -> 30549.06s]  you know if you watch the same thing for a few years maybe sometimes you can kind of get sick
[30549.06s -> 30554.98s]  of it or something you don't really like anymore so floored that people have been able to think
[30554.98s -> 30558.90s]  this is still fun and cool and interesting over the last few years if you've been around for that
[30558.90s -> 30566.71s]  long or five years whatever you always say you're going then stick around for an hour
[30567.35s -> 30572.39s]  well when a stream ends and this is going to be changing once i have lower down makes the new
[30573.35s -> 30580.04s]  graphics when i say a stream is ending i really mean the stream is transitioning into a
[30580.92s -> 30587.24s]  like 30 to 45 minute hangout session where we just hang out so the stream is technically over
[30588.79s -> 30598.04s]  but it still goes on for a little while yeah yeah it's the game yeah the gaming is done
[30599.08s -> 30602.52s]  and i go through the messages that came through over the course of the
[30603.56s -> 30609.88s]  evening i don't i'm not sure how maybe how new you are or how many streams you've caught but i don't
[30609.88s -> 30618.42s]  read uh subs or donations or anything like that on stream i will stop for something major you know
[30618.42s -> 30622.50s]  if somebody gives you know five ten twenty community subs obviously that's a that's a
[30622.50s -> 30627.70s]  big deal it's a lot of money or like 50 bucks or 100 bucks it's like that's a that's a big deal
[30629.13s -> 30634.17s]  but um for the most part i just can we kind of just do the broadcast and then we do a little
[30634.17s -> 30640.26s]  hangout session afterwards gamer cool down yeah there'll be a new screen this won't say stream
[30640.26s -> 30647.70s]  over uh in a week or so i'll have uh some new graphics some new music so it will not just be
[30647.70s -> 30656.65s]  over it'll say something else but it seems to have been working pretty well over the last couple
[30656.65s -> 30664.65s]  of years i heavily enjoyed i like doing it it takes a lot of the stress and the um kind of
[30665.98s -> 30672.26s]  need to stay on top of things like subs and donations i like this better let's just focus
[30672.26s -> 30679.42s]  on the stream and then have like a good 45 minute session to go over everything how does dna work
[30680.06s -> 30689.37s]  um you swab a thing in your mouth and then you uh import it uh but thank you to profit rocket
[30689.37s -> 30695.05s]  for the five dolls hey germa long time fan first time giving you bits i've poorly animated part

[30993.08s -> 31004.30s]  five hours i don't think ever i used to play yeah max four hours but that was a lot of fun

[31281.21s -> 31285.83s]  this was just under nine hours and i only have 1300 drop frames which is
[31285.83s -> 31295.77s]  it's pretty typical that's very normal cross your fingers that we're through the woods on that one
[31295.77s -> 31303.51s]  it's been a few days now and with this twitch having problems i can't like open my extension
[31303.51s -> 31317.75s]  manager all right it's open now here we go ready three two one open your presence and there you go
[31319.83s -> 31324.71s]  yips are out what's a colonoscopy colon i'll answer that real quickly before i go
[31324.71s -> 31334.86s]  a colonoscopy is you are put under sedation and they do an endoscopy they do they put a camera
[31337.42s -> 31344.22s]  in a place that sun don't shine and they examine your entire intestinal tract
[31346.15s -> 31358.33s]  they scope your colon yes the elbow all of it yes the whole thing do it without sedation i
[31358.33s -> 31362.49s]  actually didn't want to do it with sedation but this practice that i'm going to i asked him about
[31362.49s -> 31371.61s]  it and they do not do no sedation colonoscopies the reason why i said i didn't want sedation is
[31371.61s -> 31376.65s]  because i've done two sigmoidoscopies before without sedation they don't really do them
[31377.37s -> 31388.47s]  and a colonoscopy is sort of just a sigmoidoscopy 2.0 it's just longer so i've done them before and
[31388.47s -> 31404.04s]  i just i don't like like anesthetic drugs they i think fuck with you but uh we'll see i'm just
[31404.04s -> 31407.80s]  i'm doing it for a couple of reasons there's a preventative reason why i want you know just
[31407.80s -> 31414.20s]  want to make sure i've never really had like a full on complete colonoscopy before it's good to
[31414.20s -> 31421.72s]  do because obviously my condition that i've had over the last decade so a new place i want to
[31421.72s -> 31429.03s]  get re-evaluated i've had some issues the last year so i'm just gonna go in you know do what you
[31429.03s -> 31438.54s]  got to do and i should be fine don't worry about i have the best colon it's the largest colon no
[31438.62s -> 31455.22s]  inch colon you got into my colon that's so stupid somebody wrote that i had i just had a
[31456.02s -> 31465.45s]  monka lul does that exist should i like make that a thing i made that up don't forget that
[31466.09s -> 31478.68s]  all right good night guys i will see you tomorrow have a great rest of your night take care
