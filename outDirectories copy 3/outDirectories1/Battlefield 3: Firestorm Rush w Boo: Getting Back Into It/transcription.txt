[0.31s -> 17.70s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Battlefield 3 gameplay commentary, and this is going to be a live gameplay commentary.
[17.70s -> 25.00s]  Just wanted to give you guys an introduction, because it's been quite a long time since my last Battlefield 3 video.
[25.00s -> 31.37s]  Playing with BooMan61, who you'll be able to tell his voice the second he chimes in here in the live comp.
[31.37s -> 35.37s]  But I think he was flying the jet around, so he was having a grand old time.
[35.37s -> 42.12s]  I think we're playing on Firestorm, and the game mode is Rush, which I've become very, very accustomed to.
[42.12s -> 47.12s]  I love Rush. I love Conquest too, but they're both very, very good in their different ways.
[47.12s -> 53.42s]  But this brings me to the next thing I want to talk about. I want to try getting back into Battlefield.
[53.42s -> 62.42s]  Now, I don't know how much I'm going to upload it, I'm not sure what I'm going to do for videos, but maybe one or two a month I want to try and get into that kind of a flow where you get some content every month.
[62.42s -> 69.42s]  But I've got to get better at this game, and I've got guys like Boo, Shibby, I've played with Pwn before, as my mentors.
[69.42s -> 72.42s]  So I've learned a little bit, and I think I'm getting a little better.
[72.42s -> 79.42s]  But we shall see where I go from there, so definitely let me know, whether it's from a rating or from a comment.
[79.42s -> 83.42s]  Let me know what you want to see, if you like this, if you want to see more Battlefield.
[83.42s -> 86.42s]  I would love to know, because I love hearing from you guys.
[86.42s -> 91.60s]  So yeah, hopefully you enjoy the live commentary. It's going to kick in right now, and I'll see you guys all next time.
[91.60s -> 94.60s]  So take care, everybody.
[133.07s -> 142.84s]  I'm making a run for it. Oh my God, maybe not. Come on, somebody show up.
[142.84s -> 154.10s]  Where are all these dudes? Oh, I see a guy right there. I wonder if I can hit this guy from this far away. Hit him. I didn't kill him.
[154.10s -> 162.78s]  All kinds of crazy scaffolding on Firestone, first base. That's what I mean, this first base gets a little tedious if they don't attack you very well.
[162.78s -> 169.54s]  I'm jabbing that tank. Oh, he smoked it. Shit. They planted. Where are they? Where are they at?
[169.54s -> 179.86s]  Yes, it's right underneath you. That guy dead? Yeah, I killed a couple of them. Nice, nice.
[179.86s -> 191.33s]  Stay alive, stay alive. Oh, disarm it. We've got to get it. I got it. Hell yeah.
[191.33s -> 198.63s]  Straight ahead. Tank, take that tank boy out. I got faith in you. You've done some damage. Was it you?
[198.63s -> 205.83s]  No, I didn't shoot one thing. There's a guy coming from the right. Yeah, there's a guy coming from the left side of the truck.
[205.83s -> 212.83s]  Unless he died? Yeah, he's died. Got straight away right here, straight to the right. Boink. I just boinked him.
[212.83s -> 221.69s]  Boink. That was the worst boink ever. Is there something going on over there? I probably shouldn't be standing up here.
[221.69s -> 228.94s]  I'm assuming this is not the best idea, but I'm going to do it anyways. I'm going to balance beam right now. I'm in the Olympics.
[228.94s -> 237.44s]  Should I spawn on you? I'm pushing pretty far forward. That's risky. I'll take that as an absolutely.
[237.44s -> 249.07s]  Okay then. I got us guys all. Yeah, I see the guy right around this corner. Two of them.
[249.07s -> 258.07s]  Got him. There's guys in the pipes running along. Guy down right there. Tank. Tank is dead and guy in the pipe is dead.
[258.07s -> 265.87s]  Nice, nice, nice, nice. I love this semi for you. Oh, beautiful. To the left. Lot of dudes. I'm turning. I'm running this way.
[265.87s -> 273.52s]  Holy shit, I just took a sniper shot. Can you throw some health though? Yeah. Oh, no man. I got it right here.
[273.52s -> 289.38s]  Thanks. Are they all coming from over here? Yeah. I see this one guy straight ahead. Oh my god. Oh my god. There's like an army coming right now.
[289.38s -> 295.38s]  This is why you'd like to have a sniper rifle. And there's a helicopter or something coming out of the way.
[295.38s -> 303.26s]  Oh yeah. If I had a sniper rifle right here. See right now this guy probably has one. Yeah, that guy probably has one.
[303.26s -> 315.17s]  Question is, did we make the wraparound? Can we do it, you think? Oh, what was that? That was my javelin. Probably a bit of overkill.
[315.17s -> 323.54s]  I just used it to kill this tiny little robot thing that takes three bullets to die, but it's so pesky to hit. Oh my. Wow.
[323.54s -> 335.86s]  I just got like. Oh, it was the tank. It was the tank, I see. Tank, be honest. I don't even know where he is. Get out of my face.
[335.86s -> 342.46s]  I just held out. That guy just saved my life. Run, run, run, run, run. I need help.
[342.46s -> 357.87s]  Alright, I'm going to plant right here for a second or two. Looking for some. Is he on the. Where is that guy? Is he up here? What the hell? Where is this guy?
[357.87s -> 369.00s]  He must be right here. Is he up top? I am so confused. Yeah, he's right here. What's that? That's F. F is knife.
[370.00s -> 379.46s]  I'm just sitting. What the hell? Okay, I killed him with a knife, but it was like face stabbing somebody like the spy.
[379.46s -> 384.46s]  Like just like I'm the chaos stabbing someone. Yeah, they're the funniest ones. You just like put your hand on their chest.
[386.70s -> 393.94s]  I didn't even do the animation. I was just like one, two, three. Oh, right. You just like slashed him? Oh, God.
[393.94s -> 400.18s]  I just slashed that guy to death. Oh dear. Oh God, they planted both the charges. Holy shit.
[400.18s -> 410.73s]  Yeah, there's a tank. I'm dead for sure. For sure. There's a tank right here. Oh my God. Maybe he won't see us.
[410.73s -> 421.65s]  Well, maybe. Whatever. Did they plant it, you said? Yeah, we defused. Got my first ever magnum.
