[0.31s -> 12.46s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with FaceCamp Fortress 2.
[15.58s -> 21.48s]  Damn it. Anyways, playing as the Soldier on Barn Blitz.
[22.08s -> 26.20s]  Using the, let's just take a look, Beggar's Bazooka, the buff banner, and the escape plan.
[26.64s -> 31.32s]  Also got on my something special for someone special. Helmet without a home and these summer shades.
[31.76s -> 36.64s]  So, what do I want to talk? Oh, yeah, I wanted to bring up the fact that I just got back from Virginia.
[37.18s -> 42.50s]  Sister's birthday party was a success. Thank you to everybody that said happy birthday to my sister.
[42.58s -> 50.60s]  She really appreciates it as well as me. Now, let's get out here. These pyros! Give me that health!
[52.29s -> 60.10s]  Come on, please heal me. Oh, this is starting out starting very badly. Oh, wow, we're dead. Let's go ahead.
[60.10s -> 62.10s]  We're on Barn Blitz right now, right?
[62.38s -> 69.32s]  Let's go ahead and make some animal noises. How does that sound? Ready? So we're gonna go with a cow first.
[69.68s -> 74.12s]  So, how does a cow, what does a cow do? My god, we can't even get out of spawn.
[74.92s -> 79.66s]  Let me just do my cow noises. I think we're gonna get spawn trapped this whole game.
[79.66s -> 82.78s]  I don't think we're gonna get out. Hold on. Rain check on those noises.
[83.30s -> 86.70s]  Get up there.
[86.70s -> 90.93s]  Where's the soldier? Get out of here.
[91.21s -> 93.37s]  Somebody...
[93.37s -> 103.30s]  Okay, I'm going up here. I'm going around the other side. Forget this. Oh, there's a sentry! Got it. Get this pyro.
[103.38s -> 115.28s]  Got him. Oh, I got him too. Somebody please cap the cart. Come on. We need this extra time. There you go. There you go.
[115.28s -> 121.76s]  There you go. Uber on the cart. This is fantastic. Oh, I'm all like giddy right now.
[123.30s -> 131.18s]  Excellent boys and girls. You did it. So, I was gonna do barnyard noises because we're in Barn Blitz. That's a spy.
[132.04s -> 134.32s]  I always think snipers are spies every time. Oh.
[136.27s -> 142.23s]  They are! Snipers are spies every single time you see one. If there's a sniper that you see that looks like he's on your team,
[142.23s -> 148.19s]  he's a spy. That's like the case 99% of the time for me. All right, let's get out of here.
[148.87s -> 150.78s]  Two.
[150.78s -> 152.78s]  Three. Go!
[152.86s -> 162.58s]  Give me that. Give me that. Come on. No medic. No medic. No! No, I refuse to be burned to death.
[165.84s -> 170.54s]  Before I die, all right. Now I can do the barnyard noises. I promised you I would do this.
[170.54s -> 174.63s]  I didn't really promise, but... All right, so here we go. Let's start with a cow.
[178.38s -> 179.98s]  Moo.
[179.98s -> 188.50s]  That doesn't sound like a cow at all. That sounds like a cow on like crack. First, hold on. Let me burp.
[188.54s -> 194.77s]  Let's do a chicken. Of course, chickens are on farms as well. Sorry, let's go with the chicken already.
[194.81s -> 198.63s]  Why am I holding down the button?
[201.99s -> 203.99s]  I can do a chicken pretty damn well.
[206.71s -> 211.90s]  What does that look like on camera? I probably look like a fool. And a pig. Let's do a pig.
[212.34s -> 216.54s]  Oh my god, we got a hacker! Oh my god!
[217.66s -> 222.40s]  No!
[227.35s -> 232.06s]  I just wanted to make animal noises, and this like hacker had to ruin everything.
[234.54s -> 237.46s]  Report. How do you report him? Where's F7?
[238.64s -> 247.29s]  Abuse report. Let's go. Submit now. There he is! There he is! There's the hacker. Oh my god. What's his name?
[247.49s -> 258.33s]  Hold on a second. That was just such a chain of insane events. Got you. I got you.
[261.69s -> 263.69s]  With the heels spread around.
[264.29s -> 266.29s]  Spread all in your face.
[267.97s -> 275.67s]  Overheal. Overheal. Maybe we'll just win this instantly. That would be pretty crazy. Watch it. Watch it, man. Oh!
[277.70s -> 287.32s]  That pyro is a- holy crap. Oh, I didn't get that pyro on time. Trying to heal everybody. I'm only one person.
[289.85s -> 295.06s]  He died right in front of me. Go, go, go, go, go.
[295.62s -> 302.85s]  Medic on medic. This guy charged? No, this guy's not charged yet. He will be soon.
[303.05s -> 311.84s]  You know, we're gonna go out here. Me and this soldier. Boom! This could be it. This could be it. Right away.
[312.20s -> 318.88s]  Let's go. Cabot. Cabot. Come on. Come on up here. Oh!
[319.48s -> 327.94s]  Get clubbed. Yeah. All right. Well, that's one way to win. Come here. Gee-gee. Wait, that was a spy?
[329.31s -> 337.95s]  Interesting. But anyways, um, let's do one more. One more round because that was, uh, that was a little too quick.
[338.35s -> 346.87s]  Mission begins in 10 seconds. Gonna skip the setup time though, for sure. All right, let's push on out of here.
[347.03s -> 352.97s]  Let's push on out of here with, with, um, as much might and mystery. Whoa!
[353.77s -> 359.23s]  Huntsman sniper uber, you want it? You want a huntsman sniper uber? Is that what you're saying? No, screw that.
[359.91s -> 362.92s]  Here we- no, don't run away from me!
[363.96s -> 373.45s]  Let's get a second uber on this guy. Do we even need it? Oh my goodness. Just running around with an uber.
[373.65s -> 378.84s]  This is bad. With this team, we're crushing this team right now. My goodness gracious.
[379.44s -> 386.18s]  Might as well just run in. Just run in. They probably don't have any defenses. Whoa, yeah, they do.
[386.38s -> 392.74s]  Come on, we need somebody. We need somebody. We need like a heavy. Come on, heavy. There we are. Here we go.
[393.16s -> 400.30s]  Move on up. I'll take the heat. I'll take the heat. Oh, come on. Get rid of that sentry. Oh!
[401.22s -> 410.85s]  Kill that sentry. Oh, come on. I got it. I got the engineer. I got you. I got you guys.
[410.85s -> 425.16s]  I'm only one person. I'm only one person though. You're good. You're good. Come here, man. Come here, sister. Sister. Get that spy!
[425.28s -> 431.20s]  We're gonna win right now. Oh my goodness gracious. That's two in a row.
[431.76s -> 438.74s]  Well, all these teams might need to be balanced, but I've built a views report ready to submit.
[438.74s -> 445.23s]  I don't even know how to... the guy was like changing his name. But anyways, thank you guys so much for watching.
[445.23s -> 447.23s]  I really do appreciate it. That's gonna wrap it up here.
[447.75s -> 453.41s]  Sorry about that hacker, and I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care everybody.
