[0.70s -> 17.08s]  Hello, how are you doing? I'm doing an experiment today where I'm gonna try to say
[18.04s -> 30.31s]  less than 5,000 words. So that's 22 so far, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. I have a count on the screen,
[30.31s -> 39.53s]  an 8, 29, 30, 31. Why am I doing? I'm just, I'm not doing that. Hey everybody, welcome,
[39.53s -> 46.07s]  we're gonna play Space Channel 5, the original one. You're gonna watch me open the package.
[46.07s -> 58.98s]  We're gonna do an unboxing video of Space Channel 5. Total word or unique words? You know what?
[58.98s -> 68.44s]  I wonder. I wonder how many unique words I say per stream. You ever think about that? How many
[68.44s -> 78.63s]  unique words you say a day? Not uh, or the, and, is, maybe. I think I'm gonna do it one day
[78.63s -> 89.40s]  and just see just how terrible my vocabulary really is. And another interesting thing to do
[89.40s -> 98.04s]  would be what's the most repeated word? Obviously things like the, the, and, or, is.
[100.84s -> 116.94s]  I don't think count. They watch it be ass. That would be very surprising. Did I play this
[116.94s -> 123.70s]  yesterday? Uh, no, this is Space Channel. We did um, Hypno Space Outlaw last uh, yesterday.
[123.70s -> 131.18s]  Yeah, last night. It was a long stream to go just about nine hours to get through it,
[131.18s -> 134.38s]  the whole thing. It was a good game, really fun, really interesting concept.
[135.90s -> 139.02s]  But playing Space Channel 5 today, this is the last, by the way,
[139.74s -> 145.32s]  we're gonna, this is gonna be our farewell to the Dreamcast. Unless something else comes up
[145.32s -> 154.90s]  down the road, this is the farewell song of the Sega Dreamcast. Oh, by the way,
[154.90s -> 166.84s]  this is the last stream ever. Uh, how's my migraine? It's okay. I'm doing better. I'm doing
[166.84s -> 178.86s]  fine. I've been trying to hydrate, keep my fluids up. If there was an issue, it would have been
[178.86s -> 192.70s]  an issue yesterday and it wasn't. You need a season finale. No, don't you understand how
[192.70s -> 206.10s]  this SHIB TV show works? We're still in season one. It's just been 800 episodes. This is a
[206.10s -> 211.53s]  TV show. I don't know what, no, no, okay, hold on. What could, how many seasons has
[211.53s -> 220.33s]  German 985 been? I wonder. It's, you know, if it really was actual seasons, it's probably been at
[220.33s -> 227.38s]  least five or six. I gotta be careful though, because once you get to 10 seasons of a TV show,
[228.65s -> 232.57s]  that's where it all goes down and it's like not funny anymore. It's not interesting anymore.
[232.57s -> 236.97s]  The characters all suck. The writers are scrambling to come up with new content. So
[236.97s -> 242.94s]  what about, what about season six? I got about four more seasons worth of shit before
[242.94s -> 260.60s]  people start to hate me. That's how it works. Too late. How do you know that people don't
[260.60s -> 265.62s]  already hate you? Yeah, but you know what I mean. Anyways, let's go ahead and open this.
[266.90s -> 271.61s]  I don't like this at all, but I'm going to do it. Let me get the intro off.
[272.25s -> 281.50s]  The funniest part about what I'm about to do right now is, that was weird. When I first
[281.50s -> 287.18s]  showed this, what, like a week ago or so, two weeks ago, it was like four days ago.
[287.18s -> 293.42s]  I don't remember. My brain is beefed. I got beef brain. Here is Space Channel 5 in the
[293.42s -> 301.03s]  original liquid case. This is the original liquid casing, and it's got a hologram.
[301.03s -> 311.06s]  Look at this. Look at how cool this is. I said I didn't want to open this,
[311.06s -> 316.33s]  because it's an artifact. And somebody on Reddit, like a hundred years from now,
[316.33s -> 321.69s]  there's going to be a whole subreddit dedicated to this. Like r slash oh no,
[321.69s -> 328.04s]  right? It's going to be like 150 years in the future. And I'm going to be on the front page,
[328.04s -> 333.59s]  because this shit's going to be worth like 2,500 bucks. Those of you saying buy it on
[333.59s -> 339.32s]  Steam, this is a different game. This is the original game. Space Channel 5 part two is on
[339.32s -> 345.99s]  Steam. This one is not. You can only get this on Dreamcast. So we're playing the
[345.99s -> 351.96s]  original one. You can't get this anywhere else, unless you get an emulator or something.
[351.96s -> 365.38s]  But I got original fucking hardware. Those of you that didn't know. Okay, here we go.
[368.55s -> 374.71s]  This is the unboxing of an original liquid cased Space Channel 5 Dreamcast video game.
[374.71s -> 397.45s]  It's desynced. No it isn't. Don't do it. I'm not desynced. I'm good. It is. It
[397.45s -> 423.69s]  shouldn't be. How desynced is it? Don't do it. It belongs in a museum. Stream something else.
[423.69s -> 448.23s]  Don't do this. Please don't do this. I'm going to get the emulator one. I'm going to get the
[448.23s -> 475.19s]  emulator version. This is new. This is brand new. Don't touch it. I should be wearing gloves.
[475.19s -> 485.91s]  This is the official rules. Play to win. Register at Sega. Let's take a look at that disc.
[486.55s -> 493.42s]  Who gives a fuck? You ready? This is brand new. Going to be clicked out of the receiver
[493.42s -> 520.01s]  here. Ready? Take a look at this. Take a look at that pristine fucking cut. You can look
[520.41s -> 529.67s]  see everything. It's a mirror. That's unbelievable. Where's the corner of my desk?
[530.87s -> 546.26s]  Right here. There it is. Let's get some scratches on it. It's a fucking joke guys. Look.
[546.82s -> 562.60s]  It's pristine. Let's get it in there. Space Channel 5 part one. The original. It only
[562.60s -> 576.62s]  costed us $2,500 150 years from now. It's being damaged by UV light. What? What the
[576.62s -> 583.75s]  hell are you talking about? You look like Bradley Cooper. That's the biggest compliment
[583.75s -> 606.18s]  I've ever received. I don't think I agree with you. Isn't that nice MTV commercial from 1996?
[607.30s -> 610.34s]  Right before Beavis and Butt-Head would come on. Space Channel 5. There it is.
[613.86s -> 617.14s]  Original hardware. Not Space Channel 5 part two. This is the first one.
[617.94s -> 629.98s]  If you don't know how this game works, just you'll see. Light. This is very bright.
[629.98s -> 643.58s]  Hold on. Let me turn this down. Light. It's the UV light from the disc. Hold on.
[644.38s -> 650.28s]  Disc is already damaged. It's been ruined already.
[656.98s -> 668.44s]  It's a little better. I'm going to keep that up just in case I need to keep it going there.
[668.44s -> 678.70s]  Let's start a new game. Why? Do we need to do tutorial? Do you know how to play this?
[679.74s -> 689.03s]  I act like I've never played this before. You have a pirated copy.
[689.75s -> 698.79s]  Let's go to the options. Device options. Sound options. Player's status. Character profile.
[699.75s -> 716.39s]  This looks awful. Why does this look so awful? Maybe if I make it bigger, it'll look better.
[716.39s -> 721.19s]  We're going to have a nice, relaxing, crazy taxi day.
[723.48s -> 728.92s]  Well, here's the plan. Space Channel 5 is less than a couple hours long.
[729.72s -> 739.26s]  So if I get through this in an hour or two, then there's a couple options on the table.
[739.26s -> 744.54s]  We might just go back to PictoPix for a few hours. I'm not against that.
[744.54s -> 747.98s]  There's a Samurai top-down game that I might want to try playing. Who knows?
[748.86s -> 758.30s]  Let's just go. This takes place in 2489.
[759.10s -> 764.07s]  No, but this is the prequel. Forget about everything you know about the first one that
[764.07s -> 774.25s]  we played. I believe that is Ulala.
[784.62s -> 791.13s]  Did you just call the first game a prequel? I did because we already played the second one.
[791.13s -> 806.30s]  80, 2199. Somewhere outside Earth. This is a crunchy game, but it's okay.
[811.66s -> 819.83s]  Welcome to Spaceport. 6 45 p.m. Yeah, it's pretty crusty.
[820.71s -> 835.11s]  Why couldn't the aliens just develop 480p? They were too busy dancing.
[835.67s -> 857.40s]  Hey, watch out for the vape rings. Yeah, no, I just made that joke. I'm sorry.
[868.87s -> 883.06s]  Aliens. That's the first song. Guaranteed.
[895.61s -> 902.20s]  James Bond? No. To save the world by dancing and chewing.
[903.88s -> 910.36s]  The Swingin' Report Show. This game is very ugly. Well, because this one is the one for
[910.36s -> 916.14s]  Dreamcast. The other one was HD remaster. This didn't get an HD remake. For some reason,
[916.14s -> 921.66s]  they only did an HD remaster of the second game. And apparently the VR game.
[923.59s -> 934.10s]  This is bright. Again, bright. I got it.
[934.10s -> 949.50s]  I got it. Put the contrast down quick.
[949.50s -> 980.01s]  Quick. Here we go. A button. When they say chew.
[992.62s -> 1002.58s]  Oh, this is off. Oh, boys and girls, this is off. It's because it's being captured through
[1002.58s -> 1009.54s]  a device. And I'm seeing it delayed, I think. Uh oh. That's not good. That's not good.
[1009.54s -> 1023.34s]  This is bad. It's delayed through the capture device. This is fucking bad. What do I do about
[1023.34s -> 1040.97s]  this? I have to compensate for the lag. Is it before or after? I don't know. What's the
[1040.97s -> 1053.62s]  input lag? Okay, left. Okay, I think I'm figuring out the compensation.
[1058.18s -> 1060.18s]  It's like a half second before. Fuck.
[1074.10s -> 1100.31s]  Oh, this is not good. It's not going to be possible. I don't think it's possible to play this
[1101.35s -> 1113.61s]  while capturing it. But why? Why is that delayed? Oh, I've ripped off the protective coding
[1114.65s -> 1127.70s]  for this. Just hold on. I'll figure it out. Webcam capture? No, no, it's, it's, it's,
[1127.70s -> 1139.06s]  it's, it, I can't do webcam capture. It's still going through the device. Oh my god,
[1139.06s -> 1147.70s]  I just lost 2500 bucks. No, you know, it's not, it's not going through to the screen.
[1147.70s -> 1161.53s]  It's coming through the device to come up into my monitor. Oh, man, it's just, ah.
[1189.74s -> 1191.42s]  Sometimes I get it and sometimes I don't.
[1202.38s -> 1209.32s]  You know what it also might be? It also might be the controller too. It might, you know,
[1209.32s -> 1213.40s]  it might not be input lag. It might be inputs on the controller not being registered.
[1214.20s -> 1218.07s]  I don't have a new control. This is an original hardware Dreamcast controller.
[1219.66s -> 1223.26s]  Guys, you watched me do this like a month ago without any problems at all.
[1225.64s -> 1228.92s]  What? I did this like three weeks ago without an issue.
[1229.88s -> 1240.94s]  I played the second game and I got 100% on this level. Oh, god. All right, no more. I
[1241.66s -> 1259.91s]  beam when they say Q. Ready? Oh, I had to do that so early. Stay tuned.
[1264.60s -> 1273.80s]  Did you hear the click before it happened? Some of you did. I'm at the control tower.
[1273.80s -> 1277.72s]  According to my sources, the space rescue party's mission has gone horribly wrong
[1277.72s -> 1289.11s]  and they've been captured. Do a controller cam. Watch your footy. Let's shoot.
[1292.79s -> 1347.11s]  I can't believe you're so bad at that game. That's bait. I'm not going to take that bait.
[1347.11s -> 1353.48s]  I'm not taking that bait. I'm going to get.
[1366.95s -> 1369.43s]  I was looking forward to this too. What happened here?
[1370.15s -> 1378.90s]  Oh, I was really looking forward to this. Am I playing this on a CRTV? No, I'm capturing
[1378.90s -> 1417.03s]  this through a HDMI upscaler through an Elgato capture card. Just go emulate it. Just plug it
[1417.03s -> 1425.98s]  into the TV and record. I can't plug it into the TV. The Dreamcast does not have an HDMI.
[1426.62s -> 1433.82s]  The Dreamcast only has RCA inputs, which you have to convert to play on a monitor
[1434.71s -> 1460.17s]  that's not 15 years old. God damn it. Go buy an adapter. What? That's what it's plugged into.
[1461.53s -> 1466.49s]  That's what it's plugged into. It's plugged into an adapter. That's how it's no way I
[1466.49s -> 1496.06s]  can put it on the screen. Oh, this sucks. Emulate. I'd have to like set that up. That's
[1496.06s -> 1520.81s]  not even fucking ready. Let me try compensating one more time. A poor craftsman blames his tools.
[1523.53s -> 1531.53s]  What happens? A poor craftsman blames his tools. But what happens if the saw that they give you
[1531.53s -> 1536.65s]  is not actually a saw? What if they give you a fucking wrench and you're supposed to cut the
[1536.65s -> 1541.21s]  piece of wood? What are you supposed to do? You're going to fucking just hit the wrench until
[1541.29s -> 1552.31s]  it explodes? Shit. Shit. Craftsman blames his tool. Yeah, it's not a tool.
[1554.31s -> 1570.74s]  I might be able to get through the whole game in 7%. I have to adapt. It seems so erotic.
[1570.74s -> 1581.46s]  I am pudding. That's my report on channel 42. Don't worry. I'll take you out. Let's dance.
[1581.46s -> 1588.41s]  Up, down, shoot, shoot, shoot. Up, down, up, shoot, shoot, up, down.
[1588.41s -> 1597.83s]  That's so unprecedented. Left, shoot, up, down, shoot, up, shoot, shoot,
[1597.83s -> 1607.72s]  shoot, shoot, shoot. No match for me. Play the Steam version. I'm going to say this
[1607.72s -> 1616.89s]  one more time. I'm going to say this one last time. One final time. This is a different video
[1616.89s -> 1622.98s]  game. This is not the same video game that's on Steam. The one on Steam is the second one.
[1622.98s -> 1626.95s]  This is the first one. You can only get the first one. You can only get the first one on
[1626.95s -> 1644.98s]  Dreamcast. That's what this one is. Shoot, shoot, shoot. Up, shoot, shoot.
[1645.94s -> 1656.39s]  Shoot, shoot, shoot. Up, down, shoot, shoot, shoot. Up, left, shoot, up.
[1656.39s -> 1677.18s]  I was so off and it ended up working somehow. Down, down, down, shoot. I'm figuring out the
[1677.18s -> 1691.32s]  competition. Beat her. Retreat. I'm not taking the bait about how bad I am. This guy's
[1691.32s -> 1698.94s]  terrible at guitar. Yeah, shit Craspin blames his tools. Roger. And even better Craspin
[1698.94s -> 1704.06s]  complains his shit load about how bad the tools are and then does a spectacular job.
[1704.22s -> 1722.12s]  Kick, kick. Here we go. Shoot, shoot, shoot. Stay tuned. Nice shooting. Go get the one on
[1722.12s -> 1729.08s]  Steam. Oh, you guys are fucking with me. I've made it to the launch pad. What's this?
[1729.08s -> 1733.56s]  Was that supposed to happen? Something's up. I'm feeling kind of... No, start over. Do it
[1733.56s -> 1737.96s]  again. I got it now. I think I figured it out. It's a little bit after what I'm supposed
[1737.96s -> 1741.88s]  to do, but not really. It's like weirdly before. I don't know. I'm trying to figure
[1741.88s -> 1756.41s]  it out. I'm doing that again. I'm not getting 8%. Is the A button broken? I don't think so.
[1758.46s -> 1764.94s]  Okay, here we go. Just pretend the whole... Okay, but first of all... Hey guys. Well,
[1764.94s -> 1768.94s]  look at how fucking angry that face looks. Hey guys, welcome to the stream. I'm gonna
[1768.94s -> 1774.94s]  play Space Channel 5 tonight. This is the one that's not on Steam. It's only available
[1774.94s -> 1791.61s]  for Dream. I'm getting angry now. Is this turning into Mario Tennis? No, it's not.
[1794.41s -> 1799.26s]  ...to investigating reports that aliens have invaded and are forcing people to dance.
[1800.06s -> 1803.74s]  All lines are clear, Oola. Let's see what you're made of. Let's go.
[1805.98s -> 1809.18s]  All right, no more 10%. Stream starts now. Well... I've encountered aliens on the main
[1809.18s -> 1815.66s]  floor, and they've taken hostages. The aliens moves. Press the buttons with the rhythm.
[1815.66s -> 1847.18s]  Let's dance. No boings. No boings. They say cue. Cue, cue, cue. No boings. I got it.
[1847.18s -> 1869.08s]  I figured it out. Sometimes when it gets fast, it gets weird. I'm okay with that though.
[1869.08s -> 1884.44s]  That's fine. No more boings. Too fast, too weird. Look out. They're gonna jump out at you.
[1884.44s -> 1889.82s]  Use the A button beam on the aliens. Aliens. All right, bring them in.
[1890.14s -> 1913.13s]  Cue, cue, cue. I'm never gonna be able to play a...
[1918.68s -> 1946.26s]  I'm doing okay. It's weird, but I got it. What are they doing?
[1947.06s -> 1960.04s]  This is the equivalent of T-posing. What's going on? The music's still going.
[1965.00s -> 1991.40s]  No. She's blinking. This is fucking terrifying. You ruined the disc. I didn't do anything.
[1991.40s -> 1997.27s]  It's brand new. Wait, let me try something. This might be blue. I'm sorry. It's blue.
[2002.87s -> 2019.64s]  No, god. Poor craftsman blames his tools. Not the non-existent workbench.
[2029.22s -> 2037.46s]  God damn it. I have to do that again. Oh, it's all right. It's okay. Everything's
[2037.46s -> 2051.18s]  gonna be just fine. This is gonna be a two-hour stream for this game. Not anymore.
[2058.25s -> 2064.95s]  I didn't expect this to happen. Well, I got two backup games in case there's more
[2064.95s -> 2079.43s]  problems. I am going to get this to work. Maybe this is why they didn't remaster it.
[2095.82s -> 2099.18s]  All right, people that... All right, Lodz, the next person that says to play it on
[2099.18s -> 2102.46s]  Steam, I want you to ban them for 33 years. Every year that I spend a life.
[2103.42s -> 2118.65s]  Don't actually do that.
[2140.02s -> 2161.16s]  Play it on good old games? No. Arrest them. This is just a space bike awaiting us.
[2162.04s -> 2171.88s]  Okay, if it doesn't crash, then I should be fine. Let's go.
[2171.88s -> 2227.86s]  Disprocessing my input. Okay, when I press a button, I hear...
[2230.98s -> 2242.17s]  This is what I hear. I hear, left, chew, chew, chew, up, chew, chew. And then I press,
[2242.17s -> 2259.34s]  left, chew, chew, chew, up, chew, chew, chew. Listen, do you hear the fucking bird in here?
[2259.34s -> 2281.56s]  My data's getting stolen. All right, no crash.
[2287.86s -> 2323.69s]  Nice. Got it. Am I gonna play Sekiro? I'll be playing Sekiro day one. Not at
[2324.25s -> 2338.81s]  midnight, but first day comes up. Get the PS2 version. Okay, see you in a week.
[2340.41s -> 2353.29s]  Use the A button. I'm good. I'm good. Here we go. Stay tuned.
[2355.69s -> 2366.26s]  Ditto is better than Peepo dance. That's it. That's debatable. All right, we're at 14%.
[2366.26s -> 2370.10s]  I'm at the control tower. According to my sources, the space rescue party's mission
[2370.10s -> 2381.50s]  has gone horribly wrong and they've been captured too. What? Peepo dance?
[2383.26s -> 2433.85s]  Perfect. Perfect. He's still got it. He's still got it, even though he's compensating.
[2437.94s -> 2449.43s]  For your height, there he is.
[2462.62s -> 2508.07s]  Is that Michael? Space Michael when? He's showing up in a minute, just relax.
[2508.63s -> 2524.98s]  Is that on? Is that on? Is that? There it is. Is that on key?
[2541.88s -> 2542.52s]  All right, Bart's here.
[2550.25s -> 2556.54s]  Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Up. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Better than I thought.
[2556.54s -> 2581.58s]  Better than I thought. Right. Left. Right. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Up. See ya. Goodbye.
[2602.82s -> 2615.53s]  One, two. What happened to that guy? Oh, it's that dance. Charlie Brown.
[2615.53s -> 2619.67s]  Roger. Oh no, them say shoot.
[2619.67s -> 2637.38s]  Can you change this channel? It sucks. We're about to change the channel. Here comes a sneak peek at the next channel.
[2651.58s -> 2665.78s]  Funky? Is this Michael? Michael Jackson? Maybe?
[2665.78s -> 2669.78s]  Is that a robot? I can't tell. But let's see what it's made of.
[2669.78s -> 2672.78s]  Nope. This is the boss, I think. Or one of them.
[2672.78s -> 2675.92s]  Hypnotized robot invader.
[2695.78s -> 2698.28s]  I kind of want hearts.
[2700.28s -> 2712.21s]  Dancing my hardest. Dance with me!
[2727.72s -> 2731.24s]  Woof!
[2740.24s -> 2742.24s]  That was tricky. Tricky!
[2742.24s -> 2744.24s]  Stop screaming. What the fuck am I doing?
[2744.24s -> 2750.37s]  Is it still alive?
[2750.37s -> 2753.37s]  Check it out. There's something coming out of its mouth.
[2753.37s -> 2757.64s]  This is going to get hard.
[2758.64s -> 2763.87s]  It's the Rockettes.
[2770.18s -> 2782.98s]  I forgot! I forgot again.
[2782.98s -> 2793.01s]  Dammit.
[2793.01s -> 2806.81s]  Got that one, though. I can adapt.
[2806.81s -> 2811.84s]  Yeah, this is Rhythm Simon Says. The second one is on Steam.
[2811.84s -> 2813.84s]  I shouldn't have even said that.
[2813.84s -> 2816.84s]  Because people are going to start making fun of me about it now.
[2825.61s -> 2827.61s]  I tried.
[2829.61s -> 2831.61s]  It's the A button.
[2831.61s -> 2834.98s]  They were right. Somebody said that like 20 minutes ago.
[2834.98s -> 2836.98s]  The A button's all messed up.
[2840.15s -> 2842.15s]  My controller's broken.
[2847.30s -> 2849.79s]  There it is. Minimum view. Overall view.
[2849.79s -> 2851.79s]  Expected view.
[2851.79s -> 2853.79s]  There it's 99%. 30 plus 28.
[2853.79s -> 2856.79s]  28. 15. That's 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
[2856.79s -> 2858.79s]  100!
[2858.79s -> 2860.79s]  228% or something.
[2860.79s -> 2867.19s]  Just play on an emulator. I'm good.
[2867.19s -> 2871.10s]  I figured it out.
[2871.10s -> 2875.45s]  Only 12 minutes in the game.
[2875.45s -> 2877.82s]  And we've been streaming for 48 minutes.
[2877.82s -> 2883.42s]  Hey, I just got here. Why this? I'm going to read it.
[2883.42s -> 2891.08s]  The emulator would have more input lag. Probably.
[2901.41s -> 2903.41s]  Give me your excuses.
[2906.42s -> 2908.42s]  What's the next plan?
[2915.27s -> 2917.27s]  We lost our battle because
[2917.27s -> 2920.27s]  our tactics were too straightforward.
[2920.27s -> 2922.96s]  But we've come up with a new plan.
[2922.96s -> 2926.74s]  Powered us with elegance.
[2926.74s -> 2931.26s]  We've prepared this dancing robot for our next battle.
[2931.26s -> 2937.66s]  Who's the robot? Let's see.
[2946.70s -> 2948.70s]  Why are you savage these past weeks?
[2948.70s -> 2950.70s]  It's because of Seaman.
[2950.70s -> 2953.89s]  What?
[2956.83s -> 2968.14s]  I medically induced Seaman rage.
[2969.14s -> 2987.07s]  Cowardice with elegance is a perfect way to describe you 90% of the time.
[2987.07s -> 3009.01s]  Level 2. In the corridor.
[3012.01s -> 3015.01s]  I'm not even going to give it a response.
[3022.72s -> 3024.72s]  I like that color scheme.
[3025.72s -> 3031.14s]  What is going on? This is like Nickelodeon furniture. This is weird.
[3031.14s -> 3033.50s]  Is this the robot?
[3039.94s -> 3047.94s]  Just walked onto the set of Rocko's Modern Life.
[3047.94s -> 3069.70s]  Again. Why?
[3069.70s -> 3085.76s]  What the fuck? I swear to God.
[3085.76s -> 3087.76s]  This doesn't make sense.
[3100.80s -> 3102.80s]  Sega got sued over this game.
[3107.36s -> 3123.17s]  How? I didn't... I don't...
[3123.17s -> 3125.54s]  Okay. There's no way you get that wrong.
[3125.54s -> 3127.90s]  Up, down, up, down, up.
[3127.90s -> 3129.90s]  No, you didn't do down.
[3129.90s -> 3140.34s]  What? This is really fucking...
[3163.95s -> 3166.13s]  Aren't you glad you opened the sealed artifact?
[3166.13s -> 3168.13s]  Yeah.
[3169.13s -> 3171.69s]  Oh no, our ratings.
[3171.69s -> 3189.14s]  Quiet.
[3206.81s -> 3208.81s]  Maybe I should... I'm taking the microphone out.
[3208.81s -> 3211.56s]  Maybe it's using data.
[3216.56s -> 3221.23s]  The background is decent.
[3222.23s -> 3225.82s]  The background is also decent.
[3238.06s -> 3242.47s]  Let me see if this fixes it.
[3242.47s -> 3244.78s]  Let's see who that does.
[3270.46s -> 3298.99s]  Embarrassing.
[3303.22s -> 3305.22s]  I think each area has its own style of input lag.
[3306.22s -> 3309.86s]  Maybe. I don't think so, though.
[3329.43s -> 3332.06s]  How do you get the first...
[3360.04s -> 3369.51s]  I'm gonna do it.
[3370.51s -> 3372.51s]  What the...
[3378.10s -> 3380.10s]  Is this Space Michael?
[3383.10s -> 3385.10s]  My name is...
[3385.10s -> 3387.10s]  Is this Jaguar?
[3421.91s -> 3423.91s]  What are you doing?
[3423.91s -> 3426.15s]  I'm about to fucking turn this off.
[3426.15s -> 3431.00s]  This is unbearable.
[3433.20s -> 3435.20s]  Okay, how does that happen?
[3435.20s -> 3437.20s]  Chew, chew, chew, chew, chew.
[3437.20s -> 3439.20s]  Boing.
[3457.46s -> 3475.16s]  I'm so... I'm so soft right now, I really am.
[3493.07s -> 3495.07s]  You have to set the daylight savings time.
[3498.10s -> 3500.10s]  Ahead an hour, though.
[3501.73s -> 3503.73s]  The second experience was so great.
[3504.73s -> 3506.73s]  I don't want to have a bad taste in my mouth
[3506.73s -> 3508.73s]  I'm trying to pull this through the new
[3508.73s -> 3510.73s]  current technology.
[3538.43s -> 3541.50s]  It's the Waltz robot again.
[3541.50s -> 3545.41s]  Oh, yeah.
[3557.29s -> 3567.53s]  I gotta do some rescuing.
[3577.73s -> 3579.73s]  The game is fucking broken.
[3590.06s -> 3592.42s]  Are you sure?
[3595.43s -> 3597.43s]  No, we're good.
[3610.13s -> 3613.01s]  This is what's supposed to happen.
[3631.98s -> 3656.14s]  This is probably... Are you sure this is not where it's supposed to be?
[3656.14s -> 3658.14s]  It's impossible.
[3658.14s -> 3661.15s]  It's im...
[3661.15s -> 3664.15s]  I opened the fucking seal, I bought the dreamcast, I bought the game.
[3664.15s -> 3667.86s]  I'm gonna do it.
[3676.84s -> 3688.81s]  Oh, god damn it.
[3688.81s -> 3690.81s]  Alright, come on, I can do this.
[3693.81s -> 3695.81s]  It's a little... It's crispy, it's crunchy, it's fine.
[3697.82s -> 3699.82s]  Is something wrong with the disc? It's brand new.
[3701.82s -> 3703.82s]  I don't know.
[3703.82s -> 3705.82s]  Chat says you bought a bootleg.
[3705.82s -> 3707.82s]  That's impossible.
[3707.82s -> 3709.82s]  It was sealed in the pristine condition.
[3716.38s -> 3733.34s]  A background?
[3733.34s -> 3752.86s]  What's happening?
[3752.86s -> 3754.86s]  The boring was on cue with the music.
[3754.86s -> 3766.45s]  What the fuck happened?
[3766.45s -> 3768.45s]  Okay.
[3770.97s -> 3772.97s]  If it was cheap and sealed, it was a bootleg.
[3773.97s -> 3779.60s]  This is not a bootleg.
[3782.60s -> 3784.60s]  No. No it is not.
[3786.60s -> 3805.02s]  It's not a bootleg.
[3805.02s -> 3807.02s]  This game is not meant to be this fucked.
[3807.02s -> 3811.56s]  It's definitely a bootleg that got shrink-wrapped.
[3811.56s -> 3816.42s]  Hold on.
[3816.42s -> 3818.42s]  No, it's got original packaging.
[3818.42s -> 3820.73s]  Did they boot... How do you bootleg this?
[3820.73s -> 3823.03s]  No, I don't believe that.
[3823.03s -> 3825.03s]  How do you bootleg...
[3825.03s -> 3827.03s]  This is like original Sega Dreamcast packaging.
[3827.03s -> 3830.36s]  They didn't print this?
[3830.36s -> 3832.92s]  They didn't print this.
[3832.92s -> 3834.92s]  They didn't print this.
[3834.92s -> 3836.92s]  Look at this.
[3836.92s -> 3852.86s]  Okay.
[3852.86s -> 3854.86s]  For all you scholars in the chat, how do you prove this?
[3854.86s -> 3861.00s]  How do you prove that?
[3861.00s -> 3873.67s]  It's really easy to do this.
[3873.67s -> 3875.67s]  No, this is not a...
[3875.67s -> 3903.64s]  The disc isn't broken.
[3903.64s -> 3906.31s]  The disc is not broken.
[3906.31s -> 3908.31s]  It was brand new.
[3908.31s -> 3917.78s]  I didn't get...
[3917.78s -> 3920.79s]  Reset the console?
[3920.79s -> 3924.82s]  Hold on.
[3924.82s -> 3933.91s]  This is important.
[3933.91s -> 3936.09s]  Why would you buy...
[3936.09s -> 3938.09s]  The artifact and the history...
[3938.09s -> 3940.09s]  Is it Dreamcast?
[3940.09s -> 3942.09s]  We haven't had a problem with it so far.
[3942.09s -> 3944.65s]  Hold on. Just give me a second.
[3944.65s -> 3958.54s]  There's no way this is a bootleg.
[3958.54s -> 3962.38s]  The shit is printed into the disc.
[3962.38s -> 3964.38s]  It's not like there's a piece of paper on it
[3964.38s -> 3972.06s]  I can peel off.
[3972.06s -> 3975.51s]  No, there's no scratches or anything.
[3975.51s -> 3977.51s]  Show the disc? Yeah, I opened it on stream.
[3977.51s -> 3979.82s]  I showed it.
[3979.82s -> 3992.23s]  Let's restart this.
[3992.23s -> 4000.87s]  Chat is bullshitting you.
[4000.87s -> 4003.82s]  You can't fake the hologram.
[4003.82s -> 4005.82s]  I just reset the console.
[4034.94s -> 4038.33s]  Let's see if we get the same problem.
[4041.08s -> 4047.61s]  Before, there was...
[4047.61s -> 4049.61s]  Brand new factory.
[4049.61s -> 4051.61s]  Hello, Cosmic Kitties.
[4051.61s -> 4053.61s]  This is Ulala's report show.
[4053.61s -> 4055.61s]  Tonight, I'm reporting from the luxury spacecraft G.
[4055.61s -> 4057.61s]  The aliens seem to be stirring up a dance crisis.
[4060.10s -> 4062.10s]  I'm in the cockpit.
[4062.10s -> 4064.10s]  Sorry to spring this on you, but you got some
[4064.10s -> 4066.10s]  aliens up here.
[4066.10s -> 4068.10s]  That's like the exact same thing that I bought.
[4068.10s -> 4071.56s]  I didn't buy from here exactly, but...
[4073.56s -> 4083.42s]  That is a bootleg.
[4083.42s -> 4085.42s]  Hold on a second.
[4085.42s -> 4087.42s]  I didn't buy it from eBay.
[4125.86s -> 4149.54s]  I'm gonna beat this. I don't care if it's a bootleg or not.
[4149.54s -> 4151.54s]  I'm gonna complete it.
[4151.54s -> 4153.54s]  I'm gonna see the credits.
[4182.47s -> 4184.47s]  Up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.
[4194.78s -> 4199.77s]  No, no, no!
[4199.77s -> 4209.11s]  It's all over the place.
[4209.11s -> 4211.11s]  Do I cut my losses now and just fucking
[4211.11s -> 4214.50s]  throw this thing in the garbage?
[4214.50s -> 4235.86s]  Or what? I don't wanna do that.
[4235.86s -> 4237.86s]  I'm so annoyed right now.
[4237.86s -> 4247.08s]  I'm gonna sour my opinion on the game
[4247.08s -> 4249.08s]  if I keep going. Eh, that's true.
[4262.63s -> 4265.45s]  I think it's a combination of
[4265.45s -> 4267.45s]  old hardware, trying to take
[4267.45s -> 4269.45s]  and process inputs, combined
[4269.45s -> 4271.45s]  with being pulled through a
[4271.45s -> 4273.45s]  converter into a capture card.
[4273.45s -> 4275.45s]  And not on a CRT TV.
[4275.45s -> 4278.14s]  I think this
[4278.14s -> 4280.44s]  is a real copy.
[4280.44s -> 4297.53s]  I do.
[4297.53s -> 4299.53s]  Well, there was another option. I was gonna play this
[4299.53s -> 4301.96s]  top-down samurai game.
[4301.96s -> 4307.46s]  And then maybe PictoPix.
[4307.46s -> 4309.46s]  Yeah, it would.
[4309.46s -> 4311.46s]  That's the weird thing.
[4311.46s -> 4313.46s]  It's almost like the game is reading
[4313.46s -> 4315.46s]  the disk and causing
[4315.46s -> 4317.46s]  me not to be able to put inputs. It's weird.
[4317.46s -> 4330.65s]  Alright, what am I gonna win?
[4330.65s -> 4334.23s]  Spin the wheel! There it
[4334.23s -> 4336.23s]  goes, Vanna! Yeah, what's it gonna land
[4336.23s -> 4339.24s]  on? Oh!
[4339.24s -> 4341.24s]  Oh, you just went past the $20,000,
[4341.24s -> 4345.27s]  Jerma! Here it comes!
[4345.27s -> 4352.18s]  Come on! Not bankrupt! Not bankrupt!
[4352.18s -> 4355.06s]  Oh, it's at
[4355.06s -> 4357.06s]  5,000's okay. 5,000's okay.
[4357.06s -> 4359.30s]  Oh, top-down samurai game. You won.
[4359.30s -> 4363.59s]  Yeah, I'm gonna just move on.
[4363.59s -> 4366.22s]  In a sour and old experience.
[4366.22s -> 4368.65s]  That's obviously something's not right.
[4368.65s -> 4370.65s]  So I'm not gonna pretend like this is not
[4370.65s -> 4372.65s]  an issue with it. Because, I don't know.
[4372.65s -> 4375.02s]  Sorry, everybody. Everybody
[4375.02s -> 4377.02s]  thought this was gonna be Space Channel 5 and so did I
[4377.02s -> 4379.02s]  and it's a great game. It's great
[4379.02s -> 4381.02s]  that it went on Steam, we beat it, and it
[4381.02s -> 4383.02s]  was fantastic.
[4383.02s -> 4387.56s]  We're gonna play the top-down samurai
[4387.56s -> 4389.99s]  game now. Sorry, everybody.
[4389.99s -> 4393.77s]  Gonna change the title, we're gonna move
[4393.77s -> 4396.39s]  on. I'm very sad.
[4396.39s -> 4412.20s]  Let me change this.
[4412.20s -> 4415.53s]  This game looks very fun, though.
[4415.53s -> 4418.86s]  It looks interesting. I'm not
[4418.86s -> 4420.86s]  even sure it's on the Switch directory.
[4420.86s -> 4428.65s]  No, it's not.
[4428.65s -> 4430.65s]  Games and demos, apparently.
[4430.65s -> 4443.13s]  Let me close this out.
[4443.13s -> 4445.13s]  I'm so sad right now. I really wanted
[4445.13s -> 4447.13s]  to do Space Channel, but
[4447.13s -> 4449.37s]  it's okay. Look, it can't be
[4449.37s -> 4451.37s]  it can't happen every time, right?
[4451.37s -> 4458.66s]  Hold on, let me turn it off.
[4458.66s -> 4464.42s]  Kenshi? No, no, no, no
[4464.42s -> 4466.42s]  Kenshi. I want to play this game. This game looks
[4466.42s -> 4471.48s]  really fun. I'm gonna BRB the screen
[4471.48s -> 4491.58s]  here for a second. It's not even big enough.
[4491.58s -> 4493.88s]  Here we go. I already have it ready.
[4493.88s -> 4495.88s]  I had it just in case something
[4495.88s -> 4508.23s]  was gonna happen, and here we are.
[4508.23s -> 4510.23s]  I'm literally buying Kenshi right now. Well, you should. It's a great
[4510.23s -> 4520.92s]  game. Steam.
[4520.92s -> 4529.11s]  Okay, here it comes. Hopefully it's not too loud.
[4529.11s -> 4534.04s]  I'm gonna mute it just in case
[4534.04s -> 4538.46s]  it is. I gotta put a
[4538.46s -> 4541.40s]  controller in. Why is it an empty
[4541.40s -> 4547.42s]  yogurt cup here?
[4547.42s -> 4558.68s]  When did I eat this?
[4558.68s -> 4561.30s]  What even is this plugged into?
[4561.30s -> 4563.99s]  I mean, that was...
