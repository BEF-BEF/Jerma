[7.67s -> 26.31s]  Hey, I was checking on you. How are you? How are you? Good to see you.
[29.77s -> 37.90s]  I'm dry. My hair's a little wet. In the shower. I had to take a shower and I just didn't.
[38.54s -> 49.05s]  Oh, I'm clean now. Clean Andy. Prove it. You got to prove it.
[49.77s -> 57.74s]  Okay. I'll prove it. In a minute. Did you get stuck in the drain?
[59.78s -> 65.29s]  Obviously not because I'm here. I did actually. My toe got stuck.
[69.74s -> 74.62s]  He's lying. I'm not lying. You'll see my wet hair in a second. I'm not doing face cam today.
[74.62s -> 87.51s]  Maybe I will. I got a coffee too. We can go over a few things today. Let me tweet this. I'll be
[87.51s -> 201.77s]  right back. All right. I didn't tweet yet. I have to send a message. Let me send a message. Okay.
[204.15s -> 213.48s]  A rank today. That's exactly what we're doing. I'm going to try to get to A rank with Cosmic
[213.48s -> 217.70s]  Calamity. If you don't know who Cosmic Calamity is. I've been living under a rock.
[218.95s -> 227.85s]  Biggest superstar in the monster fighting leagues. Okay. Let me just put my Twitch here.
[237.11s -> 248.66s]  Yeah. I had to take a shower. I was feeling very icky. Okay. All right. I'm ready. No more stalling.
[248.66s -> 256.38s]  How are you? Let's move over here. Maybe I'll stall for a little bit. Just a minute here because
[256.38s -> 261.18s]  I have to explain a few things. So this week, we got some interesting things to do.
[262.47s -> 267.83s]  If you missed the stream from a couple days ago, I would suggest you go watch it. It was a fun time.
[267.83s -> 275.03s]  I was on Ms. Kiff's stream doing parasocial. It was a good time. That was Monday. Today we're
[275.03s -> 278.87s]  going to do Monster Rancher 2. And then from Monster Rancher 2, we're going to go to Monster
[278.87s -> 289.96s]  Rancher 2 and hopefully beat this game real soon. Hoping to. Like I told you, I'm not going to stop
[289.96s -> 302.18s]  streaming this game until we at least get to S rank with somebody. After this stream, we're going
[302.18s -> 309.06s]  to get the You Laugh, You Lose stuff ready and the Baby Sensory stuff because that's where we're
[309.06s -> 318.57s]  going to take an entire stream. So that will be Tuesday the 21st. I have to come up with some
[318.57s -> 326.06s]  incentives. I don't want it to be like, oh, if I laugh, I lost. I think this should be some
[326.06s -> 331.70s]  interesting incentive. Yeah. What do we get if you laugh? Exactly what I'm saying. Well, you just
[331.70s -> 342.38s]  lose. Well, yeah, you just lose. But I want it to be something to do. You give subs. Yeah, that's
[342.38s -> 350.25s]  I could do that. I think there's other ones too that could be fun. Okay. I saw you said ice that
[350.25s -> 356.30s]  motherfucker. You're talking about this. Talking about this character. What I thought you were
[356.30s -> 373.59s]  saying is pour ice down your pants. If I laugh, that's a good do that possible. You laugh,
[373.59s -> 383.29s]  you pour ice down your pants. I fucking spilled already in even 10 minutes. God damn it.
[386.44s -> 390.44s]  This is why I have an AI. This is why I just have to only use Amazon Basics keyboards
[390.44s -> 397.00s]  only. They're never I can never have anything remotely valuable underneath me in this room.
[398.04s -> 405.53s]  Ever. You know, you see those streamer setups that they look amazing. There's all those cool
[405.53s -> 410.65s]  swirling lights and there's awesome pristine keyboards and they've got so much cool shit.
[410.65s -> 415.29s]  They have so much wire control. No, I will break that stuff. I will ruin it.
[416.01s -> 422.79s]  Coffee is underneath the space bar now and I can't get it. I need a paper towel. Hold on.
[422.79s -> 456.31s]  Give me one second. All right. Hello. You do that thing where you bunch up a piece of toilet paper
[456.31s -> 464.47s]  or paper towel and you slide it under. I'm picking a lock. You have to slide it long ways
[464.55s -> 470.82s]  underneath the keys and like tilt it around. I'll break it if I pop it off.
[471.46s -> 483.98s]  Will I break it? Let me see. Have you voted in the awards? I mean, the voting is not open yet.
[483.98s -> 487.02s]  Hopefully that's not a problem. I just pulled the space bar off. Is that a problem?
[488.97s -> 494.12s]  Oh no. All right. I can get under here though. Oh, what the what else is under here?
[495.61s -> 504.73s]  I feel like I just lifted up the couch. Oh, oh, that's what it looks like under there.
[504.73s -> 516.97s]  Cover it back up. All right. Let's go. Shit. I didn't put it on right. I put it on upside down.
[518.39s -> 523.11s]  I don't care. I don't care. I'll fix it later. All right. Let's do it. Welcome back, everybody.
[524.33s -> 530.30s]  We're doing vigorous training. You want to just prove that? Okay, I'll prove it.
[530.30s -> 538.76s]  Okay. There you go. See? Prove that I was just in the shower. There it is.
[538.76s -> 548.41s]  No more face cam. Not today. You're looking, you're looking nice and slick. Hey, nice.
[551.21s -> 559.03s]  Oh, yeah. The you laugh, you lose stuff. I've never done it before. I can't believe I've gone
[559.03s -> 569.35s]  10 plus years across YouTube and Twitch and I've never done it. I have no idea what's going to
[569.35s -> 574.79s]  happen. Why have I not? I don't know. I just haven't. There's never was, there's never reason
[574.79s -> 583.05s]  for me to do it. It's because it's lazy content. I think it's fun. Look, something can be lazy
[583.05s -> 592.10s]  content and be really fun to do. It's all right. All right. So what does the schedule look like?
[592.10s -> 600.57s]  First of all, hey, welcome again. Thanks for coming by the stream. Let's go. Put the cam back on.
[600.57s -> 605.80s]  All right. I'll put the cam back on for, there is something else I want to address that I thought
[605.80s -> 608.60s]  was hilarious, but I want to wait till a lot of people are here because it's one of the funniest
[608.60s -> 614.33s]  fucking things I've seen in like at least a month. So we need to wait. I want to wait till everyone
[614.33s -> 624.57s]  gets here. All right. Last thing I did is I beat C rank. So we're going to take this guy, do some
[624.57s -> 637.32s]  training. Wait, what is the actual, let me see the data. 621 intelligence. 8K is not enough.
[637.32s -> 644.71s]  8K isn't enough. Well, I'm not saying it's not enough. I'm just saying it has to wait. Give me
[644.71s -> 652.55s]  like 30 or 40 minutes so everyone that wants to be here is here. So I want to get to like probably
[652.55s -> 660.87s]  700 intelligence and like three or 400 skill. The only way this thing is ever going to be worth
[660.87s -> 667.06s]  using is just by being a glass cannon. That's it. So we're doing the same thing we did before.
[667.06s -> 675.53s]  Get them in there. Start with the, not power. Intelligence and skill. Meditate. Go for it.
[675.53s -> 683.64s]  This is the worst monster in the game, Jeremy. You need to let it go. I think I can get this guy to A
[683.64s -> 706.04s]  rank. I really do. Needs more life. All right. You see him well. How am I still soft? B. All right.
[706.04s -> 716.36s]  When's the actual official B tournament? Right here. All right. I got a little while. I got some time.
[716.36s -> 721.38s]  Okay. You guys ready? Are you guys ready to hear like one of the funniest things I've fucking seen
[721.38s -> 730.06s]  all week? So somebody in the discord had a little bit of a problem. Just a small problem. And they
[730.06s -> 740.06s]  brought it to the discord's attention. And I, my stomach hurt from laughing at this picture. So
[740.06s -> 745.67s]  why don't we take a look and see what happened? So this is what they posted.
[746.87s -> 754.30s]  I'm actually going to turn the game capture off for a second. So, uh,
[754.30s -> 762.02s]  jazzy ball has a little story for us and it goes something like this. So I'm home for the holidays
[762.02s -> 768.74s]  from college and I decided to watch some germ of vids on my parents' big TV because I was bored.
[768.74s -> 774.30s]  Okay. We've established what's going on. So I microwave some pizza and turn it onto this
[774.30s -> 781.24s]  compilation of edits of Jerma's faces. When it gets to this face, however, the TV froze.
[781.24s -> 788.39s]  So I tried turning it on and off to restart it, but the TV just won't turn off. And it's stuck
[788.39s -> 794.65s]  on this fucked up image of Jerma's face. Okay. I don't know how that happened. A couple hours
[794.65s -> 800.57s]  pass and I don't know why it took me a while, but I finally decided to unplug the TV. And then I
[800.57s -> 806.07s]  realized that the face is permanently burned onto the screen. Like it's just stuck there.
[806.78s -> 812.95s]  My parents aren't back until later in the night. So now I'm freaking out trying to cover the screen
[812.95s -> 824.65s]  so that they don't see the stupid face burned onto their thousand dollar TV. What do I do?
[824.65s -> 838.95s]  I don't even understand. Green burn-in? How long does screen burn-in last? People are saying fake,
[838.95s -> 847.82s]  but I mean, it looks kind of real. The screen burn-ins for OLEDs can be permanent.
[847.82s -> 865.46s]  No, it's not. Okay. That's insane if it is. It's fucked up forever. So what do you do?
[865.46s -> 874.55s]  OLED, it can be permanent. Okay. Well, here's what we need. This is very important. 24 hours from now,
[874.55s -> 879.66s]  I need an update or even now, like even like a like six to 12, you know, hours from now.
[879.66s -> 890.07s]  I want to see the improvement. Imagine coming home and this is what you see on the TV.
[890.07s -> 894.39s]  But you were asking, how do you, what do you do about this? I don't know. You can't just
[894.39s -> 901.13s]  throw a blanket on this. I mean, why is there a blanket on the TV? What are you going to have
[901.13s -> 910.87s]  to just come clean and say, I don't know what happened. I left this face on here, pay them back,
[910.87s -> 921.29s]  replace the TV. It's your fault. You need to replace the TV. I didn't do anything. It's my
[921.29s -> 933.94s]  fault. You have to replace it. I didn't sell the TV to this person. You, you psycho. You destroyed
[933.94s -> 940.76s]  somebody's TV. So that's what, okay. According to what they said, this is what it looks like when
[940.76s -> 958.18s]  the TV is unplugged. Buy the TV from them. All right. I'll tell you if it's permanent. Thanks a
[958.18s -> 965.02s]  lot, dude. Now this is burned into my monitor. Just have a screensaver. How is it emitting
[965.02s -> 972.84s]  blue light if it's unplugged? Oh, it's not unplugged. That's okay. I see. I see. But that's
[972.84s -> 988.54s]  just what it looks like when it's turned on. Okay. We need an update. Replace it. Replace the TV.
[988.54s -> 994.73s]  Can you imagine? Like just, I get him in touch with community Jake. It's just like, let's get,
[994.73s -> 1009.96s]  let's get, let's get this person a new TV. It's your fault. I love that though. That's so funny.
[1009.96s -> 1021.21s]  We need an update. Buy this TV and put it in your house. They're very active on discord right now.
[1021.21s -> 1042.01s]  It's too funny. Put it up on the Reddit shelf. Yeah. Maybe if that's actually real, that's too
[1042.01s -> 1047.86s]  funny. Maybe we'll have to get you in touch with community Jake. Let's see. Uh, see what we can do
[1047.86s -> 1058.02s]  for you. Cause that's absolutely hysterical that you like are going to get like in trouble. Put it
[1058.02s -> 1064.15s]  up as a third monitor. There's no way the burning happens like that permanently. I don't know. It's
[1064.15s -> 1070.49s]  really funny. Regardless. It looks real to me. Use your head German. It's not real. It's funny
[1070.49s -> 1081.27s]  though. You're going to get scammed. I didn't say this was going to happen. I just said we need,
[1081.27s -> 1093.34s]  we need some extra evidence and some extra proof that it was real. I need to write this down. Note
[1093.34s -> 1102.74s]  funny equals real. I didn't say funny. I said we need a little more evidence. Okay. We need to do
[1102.74s -> 1117.62s]  some more training as he didn't do it last time. Don't fail it again, please. All right. Good.
[1117.62s -> 1134.01s]  Even if it's fake, the idea is really funny. Yeah. All right. The image view naked on stream
[1134.01s -> 1146.17s]  is burned into my monitor. What should I do? Now let me be very clear about this. Very clear.
[1146.25s -> 1153.48s]  This is a, this is funny. There's a funny little thing that happened. I, I ain't replacing all your
[1153.48s -> 1160.07s]  TVs. Okay. If you go buy an OLED TV today and deliberately burn an image of my face on it,
[1160.07s -> 1166.54s]  I ain't fucking replacing it. I just, let's be very clear about this. You're doing it on your
[1166.54s -> 1173.67s]  own free will. I have nothing to do with that. I'm going to make that very clear in before the
[1173.67s -> 1180.47s]  wave of OLED TV burning images that like, dude, I fucking left the TV on and it burned an image
[1180.47s -> 1196.31s]  of you and oh my God, what do I do about it? Help me. I'm sorry. Not happening. Oh, it's,
[1196.31s -> 1208.97s]  it's calamity's birthday. Yeah. So if you want to do that, that's up to you. I got nothing to do
[1208.97s -> 1236.18s]  with it. I got a lot of money. How old is Cosmic Andy? Cosmic Andy is two years old at this point
[1236.18s -> 1244.38s]  now. My dad saw a video of yours. He had a heart attack. You owe, no, no, we're not going down
[1244.38s -> 1253.75s]  this road. Not going down this road today. Now let's get three mint leaves and let's get three
[1253.75s -> 1281.19s]  nuts oil. Oh, I can only hold two. Okay. Fine. Okay. Uh, I actually am going to, no, I won't do
[1281.19s -> 1296.78s]  nuts oil and we're going to do normal skill training. How does it feel to be a permanent
[1296.78s -> 1305.85s]  screen saver skill? Let's go. I'm doing this in the wrong order. Okay. I got to, I'll fix it next
[1305.85s -> 1319.02s]  week. Remember there's a lack of, there's a lack of worst hair nominees. I don't think that just
[1319.02s -> 1336.90s]  means my hair looks better this year. I need to do 50 beam usages. All right. Keep counting. And
[1336.90s -> 1346.89s]  we have to do the mint leaf. I wonder when we're going to get, when is he going to get too old?
[1346.89s -> 1364.01s]  Hey Yorn, thanks for the five. Give me it to yourselves. He's on death store now. No, he's not.
[1364.01s -> 1370.94s]  He's got like at least not a year or two. This monster has one of the longest lifespans. Exactly.
[1370.94s -> 1380.20s]  Don't tell me that it, that he's going to die. Won't be able to handle it. It's literally just
[1380.20s -> 1390.12s]  a wall dude. It's going to live a long time. It might. Tablets training. It's got a normal
[1390.12s -> 1399.32s]  lifespan of 410 game weeks. Oh nice. Aaron tree. Okay. So if this is Aaron tree,
[1399.32s -> 1402.92s]  all right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Good, good, good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[1402.92s -> 1406.90s]  Stressed out. I know. I know. I know. I know. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[1406.90s -> 1428.46s]  I got a bunch of dumb items. What is all this shit? Ooh, just eat this. Is this the new release? It
[1428.46s -> 1435.94s]  is. This game is currently on steam right now. It's a bundle of the first and second game. You
[1435.94s -> 1442.71s]  get them both. Uh, they are, and there it's also on iOS too right now, I think, which is amazing.
[1442.71s -> 1449.86s]  And it's on the switch. God, I hope they make another one. Like just make another monster
[1449.86s -> 1455.77s]  rancher. I know it sucks because they need like, they need like 10 million people to buy this game
[1455.77s -> 1460.86s]  to make it worth doing another one. I don't know if it's going to happen. Whatever number they need
[1460.86s -> 1474.18s]  to hit. I hope they hit because I would really love a new generation monster rancher video game.
[1474.18s -> 1481.91s]  All right. I need to buy much more of this stuff. Actually, hold on. I can sell this crap too. Can
[1481.91s -> 1496.98s]  I? Stimulate a monster's abilities. Can you get banned for doing these drugs? This will temporarily
[1496.98s -> 1506.02s]  stimulate a monster's abilities. What does it do? Yeah. All right. Well, I'm going to sell some of
[1506.02s -> 1517.32s]  this stuff. The magic banana. I'm just going to sell it. I don't want to use it unless maybe I
[1517.32s -> 1524.09s]  should just use it. We have at least two or three monster rancher lore masters. It's going to reduce
[1524.09s -> 1531.54s]  your lifespan. Don't use it. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. All right. I'll just sell it.
[1531.54s -> 1543.74s]  I need to make room for leaves and, you know, sell the mango. I don't want it. Sell the banana.
[1543.74s -> 1550.34s]  I don't want it. I don't even know what it does. I think it reduces lifespan. 500 for this. Holy
[1550.34s -> 1556.30s]  shit. All right. That's pretty good. I'm going to keep the disc chips because you can combine them,
[1556.30s -> 1564.25s]  right? And when you actually combine monsters. All right. Now we need at least two more mint
[1564.25s -> 1582.95s]  leaves and four more nuts oils while the sale is here. Okay. Five, four. I'm about to use one of
[1582.95s -> 1593.22s]  these anyways. So, all right. Okay. I had a dream that you were streaming yourself cutting
[1593.22s -> 1610.18s]  stirs breaks. Why? Okay. I'm going to rest because I need to kind of reset this. Wow. What kind of
[1610.18s -> 1625.78s]  dream is that? Cutting his breaks? All right. Well, let's do nuts oil. Let's do this right.
[1625.78s -> 1652.65s]  Mint leaf. Regular training. Nuts oil. Heavy training. I'm going to go take a nap. Dermot,
[1652.65s -> 1657.24s]  can you wake me up in a couple of hours? In two hours, I'll make sure to scream really,
[1657.24s -> 1681.77s]  really loud and just make sure you have your headphones on. Wait. Yes. Right. What a scream
[1681.77s -> 1699.14s]  timer. I'm not, that doesn't seem to be a screen timer. All right. Give us a big value here. Is
[1699.14s -> 1712.97s]  it cheating? That's cheating. Whatever. 700 intelligence should be enough to be able to
[1712.97s -> 1721.21s]  at least beat a rank. How long is the stream going to be? I don't know. So don't have fun.
[1721.77s -> 1743.93s]  Do defense. I think it's too late to do defense. It's too late. I think we need to be able to
[1744.01s -> 1756.23s]  one hit anti people. Defense is worthless. I think they've changed a bunch of stuff in the game
[1757.90s -> 1764.22s]  or not change, but patched old broken shit that doesn't work anymore. Right. There was a bunch
[1764.22s -> 1768.78s]  of bugs in the original game that they just fixed. And I think it made some of the things
[1768.78s -> 1785.74s]  more valuable. At what point is the magic slab smarter than you? Probably now. I don't,
[1786.62s -> 1792.71s]  it's out of a thousand. So I wonder what my monster sheet would look like.
[1793.27s -> 1802.20s]  Okay. So if it's out of a thousand, my monster sheet definitely looks like this.
[1803.21s -> 1816.89s]  Life is probably one 20 power, like one 41, like 50, like here intelligence, probably like 240.
[1816.89s -> 1826.12s]  So like down here skill, I'm putting up to like seven or 800, like here speed is probably like
[1826.12s -> 1846.81s]  one 40 and defense is zero. What do you mean? What fame is zero. That's not accurate.
[1846.81s -> 1855.00s]  Fame would be 30. All right. Who would, okay. At our peaks right now,
[1855.00s -> 1860.97s]  German nine, eight, five, or this slab in this game's universe, who is more popular
[1860.97s -> 1870.15s]  with the 18 to 35 demographic? I gotta make that very, very, very clear. No, I don't think so.
[1870.15s -> 1888.76s]  I think it's me. I think, I think I would be more popular. All right. Well, I, yeah, all those would
[1888.76s -> 1897.78s]  be pretty bad. So the last thing we did was, what did I eat? I, I such a stupid attention span.
[1898.50s -> 1906.47s]  It was, what was the last thing that I just did or the last thing I clicked on? Cause I need to
[1906.47s -> 1914.68s]  give a, you didn't do anything yet, but what was the last thing I did? I gave tablets. Okay. Okay.
[1914.68s -> 1947.90s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. All right. Big success. Do it. Good. 656 intelligence
[1950.04s -> 1963.10s]  in there. When is the tournament? I think it's coming up soon in like a week or two.
[1963.66s -> 1978.39s]  I wonder if I can handle it. So I can do skill rest and then we'll, we'll go in for B cup.
[1978.39s -> 1996.79s]  I could get skill over 300, which would be big. Good. Excellent. I don't have that image anymore.
[1997.43s -> 2010.66s]  There we go. You want to peep the horror here. It's an old ass clock too. I like that clock.
[2011.30s -> 2020.66s]  I didn't even see that clock. That clock's awesome. All right. Rest up for the battle.
[2021.30s -> 2025.94s]  See if I can handle B rank. If, if, if this, this is a rank, if I beat this, I'll get to a rank.
[2029.00s -> 2046.65s]  What time is it on that clock? It is six, six, like six, like 17, six 18. I win.
[2047.21s -> 2056.87s]  You're in pretty good shape. It's very well. All right, let's do it. I hope I can handle this.
[2056.87s -> 2073.75s]  B rank. This is the big one. This is a huge deal. Official B rank cup. Let's go. I'm actually kind
[2073.75s -> 2096.89s]  of scared because we've not seen any of these people here. All right. Go. What is with it?
[2096.89s -> 2100.17s]  What's this defense? Oh, you're dead though, because that doesn't matter for intelligence.
[2103.75s -> 2121.13s]  It's over. Let's go. You know what to do. Stay back. Bye. Let's get this B rank, A rank today.
[2121.85s -> 2133.51s]  Get all the defense in the wrong places. People were not feeling this strategy before,
[2135.22s -> 2140.74s]  but here's where this all falls apart. If there's another really high intelligence,
[2141.46s -> 2150.33s]  high speed monster, that's the hard, complete hard opposite. That's like paper versus rock.
[2150.89s -> 2158.54s]  I absolutely lose that. So we just hope that's not anybody here. Whoa, look at that thing. I
[2158.54s -> 2167.06s]  think it was like a weird dinosaur wall versus wall. That wall does maybe that wall is power.
[2171.34s -> 2173.82s]  All right. I was actually really scared before. Now I think I'm all right.
[2176.57s -> 2187.94s]  Look like, like, like, like, like the bunny. I'll be high speed. This is still fine.
[2190.04s -> 2194.20s]  I just have to hit you once. I don't have to care about anything else. We can throw coins in the
[2194.20s -> 2201.18s]  air. All right. I do have to worry about that power though. That's a lot. I have no defense.
[2201.18s -> 2223.37s]  We just stay back. 46% throw the coin in the air. We went if I miss it's over because I can't take
[2223.37s -> 2237.46s]  more than one hit. I don't think or two hits total. I don't like Cosmic Andy. Well, Cosmic
[2237.46s -> 2245.34s]  Andy is probably going to be dead. If I've been within the next, like one stream hour. So the
[2245.34s -> 2252.66s]  whole point is to get Cosmic Andy. I just keep forgetting their name up to a rank. So we unlock
[2252.66s -> 2259.77s]  the other monster types that we can unlock from the CD stuff. It looks like they're going to do
[2259.77s -> 2266.90s]  what they're supposed to do. As long as we beat B rank, we get access to like, I think five or
[2266.90s -> 2280.95s]  six more breeds. That's good. All right. Wall versus wall. What do you got? All right. That's
[2280.95s -> 2291.34s]  speed. How do you even have speed that low? You built your character like a moron to spread out.
[2291.34s -> 2308.62s]  It's over. I went way too spread out. See you later. Hey, it's worked every time so far.
[2308.62s -> 2320.70s]  People, I don't know if I would vote against this right now. That's a bad idea. Remember,
[2320.70s -> 2325.02s]  there are some unlockable monsters that you can get by beating a D rank battle at a specific time.
[2326.07s -> 2333.34s]  Really? I actually might be able to beat a rank with this monster and that just opens up the flood
[2333.34s -> 2348.74s]  gates. What if you miss? Then I lose. But it looks like statistics are on our side today.
[2349.54s -> 2357.80s]  The official a rank match is way harder. I'm going to assume that this is not going to be the
[2357.80s -> 2363.21s]  character that I beat a rank with. I just wanted to get to a rank with this character because then
[2363.21s -> 2368.89s]  we can unlock some more stuff, do some combinations, have maybe some higher base stat monsters and go
[2368.89s -> 2383.80s]  from there. All right. Epsilon. It's like a robot. This looks like a rare monster. Very spread out.
[2383.80s -> 2388.46s]  I think I still, I just have to, I don't know if I'll one hit kill. That's a lot of speed.
[2389.02s -> 2406.07s]  All right. I'm kind of scared. A lot of speed. Oh, it's over. It's actually over. If you missed
[2406.07s -> 2409.59s]  the first shot, it's over. Oh, no, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. I
[2409.59s -> 2430.87s]  can do it again. Hold on. Hold on. Yes. Different move. Okay. It's almost mathematically impossible
[2430.87s -> 2440.01s]  for me to lose the Hirate who needs to lose one more time. And I actually know I have to
[2440.01s -> 2457.88s]  win my next two. Okay. I destroyed Pirate though. That's the competition right now.
[2464.26s -> 2468.58s]  That wall has 25 speed. It means you're going to get hit by every single attack.
[2470.60s -> 2479.03s]  Nothing will miss you. All right. Sanjuras. This is the weird like sun one, right? I kind of want
[2479.03s -> 2495.38s]  one of these. That's so cool. Oh, oh shit. Okay. Hold on. I still think I'm okay.
[2499.69s -> 2503.29s]  The speed and the life I'm concerned about, but all we have to do is flip a coin
[2506.65s -> 2519.61s]  and percentages here. I knew it. I knew that just dumping every training regimen into
[2519.61s -> 2533.64s]  intelligence was the right call. I'm getting great coin flips though. I've only lost one coin flip
[2536.02s -> 2554.18s]  out of probably seven or eight times. Somebody said I'm missing a doctor's appointment for this.
[2554.18s -> 2561.85s]  No, go to your doctor's appointment. Trust me. You'll be pissed in a few days because whatever's
[2561.85s -> 2565.37s]  wrong, you're going to look back and be like, I fucking had an opportunity to go.
[2566.41s -> 2586.70s]  Trust me. Too late. I already missed it. Oh, I'll watch the stream in the waiting room. All right.
[2587.90s -> 2600.17s]  Robe Neil. Robe Neil has not been doing very well. I don't know why. Stats are pretty good.
[2601.16s -> 2610.22s]  Really high health. What's the problem here? Just too spread out. Oh, it ain't my fucking problem.
[2610.78s -> 2628.46s]  It's taking fucking cemetery. Oh, oh, I can't go backwards. I just had to hit you once. Come
[2628.46s -> 2637.50s]  here. Back it up. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. What? Shit. Okay. Holy shit. That's the four
[2637.50s -> 2649.32s]  in a row that I've missed. All right. It doesn't matter. I just hit one. Back it up. Back it up.
[2650.86s -> 2661.98s]  Oh, you piece of shit. I'll be able to do one more. I need 24 guts. Come on. 22, 23, 24.
[2662.78s -> 2679.67s]  I lost. I lost. I actually lost. Well, here comes all the coin flips I'm going to lose in a row.
[2681.29s -> 2696.78s]  60% lost it seven or six or seven times in a row. I still win. Who has one loss?
[2699.51s -> 2707.05s]  Okay. Pyriteu is the only one that has two losses. If they lose the next match, I clenched it.
[2708.78s -> 2721.02s]  Yeah. Pyriteu just has to lose. All right. Who's Pyriteu going against?
[2721.58s -> 2735.37s]  Uh-huh. All right. I just can't lose this. I either can't lose this or Pyriteu has to lose
[2735.37s -> 2750.17s]  the next match. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Yikes. Okay. I just have to get a hit
[2750.17s -> 2756.82s]  off first. Oh shit. It's Jerma. Right? Because that's exactly what I said my stats would look
[2756.82s -> 2771.83s]  like. I don't have wings. Coin flip. Not yet though. I just pissed him off.
[2773.86s -> 2790.54s]  Clenched it. All right. We got it. I just unlocked like a bunch of breeds. I love this game. This
[2790.54s -> 2808.25s]  game is so much fun. It really is. Rank alone doesn't unlock breeds. They have very cryptic
[2808.25s -> 2813.21s]  unlocks. Yeah. I know that there's probably like a more than a dozen breeds that you
[2813.21s -> 2819.53s]  have to do specific things for. But once you get to rank four, doesn't that unlock?
[2820.09s -> 2828.39s]  Four or five different breeds? Getting to that trainer rank four. No? Are you sure? I thought
[2828.39s -> 2843.32s]  it did. I guess it doesn't unlock shit. It doesn't? I thought it did. It unlocks a tournament that you
[2843.32s -> 2858.10s]  have to attend. Oh. It's something very specific for everyone. All right. Is there a good unlock
[2858.10s -> 2869.51s]  guide? I know there's a good website. What's it called? The Legend Cup, right? Isn't that a
[2869.51s -> 2877.43s]  good place to do it? Monster Rush to unlocking guide for all 38 breeds. Holy shit. There are
[2877.43s -> 2889.27s]  38 other breeds to unlock. Wow. All right. Let's go through this. I'm at 100 fame.
[2889.83s -> 2900.26s]  Okay. Some of them are locked behind errand trees. I'm a cryptic as hell.
[2900.82s -> 2908.73s]  Ooh, look at that increase. That's good. Okay. Achieve breeder rank of four, beat B rank,
[2908.73s -> 2917.66s]  and you need to purchase the first house upgrade. What the fuck? Okay. Hold on a minute. This is
[2917.66s -> 2926.54s]  ridiculous. If you have 17,000 gold or more on May 4th, Vinto will arrive and upgrade your
[2926.54s -> 2935.32s]  stable for 15,000 gold. This will unlock these two. Wait, I have to have a certain amount of
[2935.32s -> 2952.42s]  money on one day? Oh, okay. Okay. One of these is I have to achieve a rank four breeder and then
[2952.42s -> 2960.31s]  have to finish the expedition at Correa. So you have to send somebody that's at least B rank to
[2960.39s -> 2969.85s]  do the heavy errand tree, which is the Mandy desert between the months of March and August.
[2969.85s -> 2975.93s]  If the monster is uninjured, it will return with a spear. Your monster and the centaur will fight.
[2975.93s -> 2979.85s]  This will take an entire week. So you'll lose lifespan afterwards. You may use the
[2979.85s -> 2984.41s]  spear and combining to unlock the centaur. There's no particular penalty. What the fuck is all this?
[2989.58s -> 3001.91s]  All right. So, um, cool. Very cool. You did a great job. Oh, this is kind of spoilery.
[3001.91s -> 3008.87s]  Maybe I shouldn't be reading this. I want a silk cloth. Yeah, sure. Whatever.
[3008.87s -> 3017.29s]  Some of these are spoilery and some of these are literally impossible unless I did it step by step.
[3020.02s -> 3035.70s]  What are some of the easier ones? You must be on the ranch one week, four of May to trigger events.
[3039.45s -> 3060.78s]  Okay. The Fimba versus IMA is every four years. Centaur is really easy to get.
[3067.03s -> 3076.71s]  Hello. It's an express mail from IMA. Oh, here we go. This is us being ranked four. Nice.
[3077.27s -> 3082.66s]  The expedition ones are pretty straightforward. I'll do those ones first. These other ones seem
[3082.66s -> 3094.25s]  kind of confusing. All right. We're ranked four. Cool. Why are you playing with a Minecraft block?
[3094.25s -> 3101.91s]  That Minecraft block is one hit killing every single monster. So I need to get, I need to
[3101.91s -> 3110.10s]  purchase a house upgrade. Remember for expeditions, you'll need to have your monster to have high
[3110.10s -> 3125.05s]  life and high fame. He's at a hundred fame right now. Okay. So I need to, how do I get the first
[3125.05s -> 3134.95s]  house upgrade? It's January, January, February. When, when do I get to do this? His life stats
[3134.95s -> 3142.06s]  really low. You need high strength life and intelligence. I'm supposed to do that. I have
[3142.06s -> 3149.66s]  lots of money and just wait. Okay. So let's keep the training going then. I might be able to do
[3149.66s -> 3156.89s]  a rank next time. When's the next day? Wednesday. This one's four grand. All right. Here we go.
[3156.89s -> 3165.51s]  The official A cup is in a couple of months. You should have a separate expedition monster.
[3169.35s -> 3181.91s]  All right. I love this. This is so much fun. Okay. Did I just start banking money? I mean,
[3181.91s -> 3185.91s]  do I just rest and then just do this and just bank money to make sure I can afford the house
[3185.91s -> 3191.27s]  upgrade? All right. Let's do that. Let's go wipe the floor with everybody in B rank.
[3191.27s -> 3194.31s]  They're a bunch of, they're a bunch of shitties. They never, what? They're never going to make it.
[3194.31s -> 3212.68s]  Just go there and fucking wipe the floor with them. Here we go. This is for just four grand.
[3212.68s -> 3221.34s]  This is quick too. This is a lower grade tourney. What? Your monster's fame will drop. Will it?
[3222.06s -> 3239.74s]  Maybe I shouldn't do this. Nevermind. Who cares? Make the money. Just do it. All right. Let's do
[3239.74s -> 3260.79s]  it. I don't care. I need money. Oh, the serious cup smurfing. I got to try to get to at least 10
[3260.79s -> 3268.55s]  to 20,000. Then that makes the next monster so much easier to train. I don't have to worry
[3268.55s -> 3288.76s]  about anything. I would kill about these guys in one hit. We're fine. Give me that money.
[3288.76s -> 3302.57s]  You're going back to middle school to beat up children. That's not accurate. Going back to
[3302.57s -> 3310.01s]  middle school to beat up children would be doing E rank or D rank. This is B rank. These are grownups.
[3310.57s -> 3323.48s]  Not as good as me. This is kind of unfair. You basically just made a gun.
[3325.67s -> 3336.63s]  What is that move that they have? What's that? What's that like Verizon tower signal?
[3336.63s -> 3353.48s]  What does that move do? It's a 5G move. And what's the T-Mobile data thing do?
[3354.12s -> 3378.01s]  This one was quick. Called Soundwave. It has an S rank hit rate, but it's weak.
[3378.01s -> 3388.09s]  I actually might want that. Because if you miss, then it sucks. Being able to guarantee
[3388.09s -> 3398.06s]  a hit at least to have some damage. Oh, confused. It would have been scary if I didn't have
[3401.91s -> 3431.34s]  high intelligence. All right. This is easy money. This is easy money for you guys, too. I imagine
[3431.34s -> 3435.93s]  some of you guys, I don't know. Yeah. Five and a half million versus 150K.
[3436.73s -> 3442.30s]  I mean, 150K, I'm looking for the huge payout, but I don't think that's going to happen.
[3442.86s -> 3455.13s]  4,500 bucks. Don't drop by that much, right? Okay. I'm going to keep doing B ranks. Especially the
[3455.13s -> 3474.50s]  four monster ones. And I keep getting bonuses and shit. This is awesome. I want polish. Finally
[3474.50s -> 3493.11s]  got over 10 grand. Yeah, fine. I need 15 grand, you said, right? What? 20 grand? What's the next
[3493.11s -> 3506.71s]  one? Free for all elimination. Can I hang here? Do you think I could do it? Or is it going to be
[3506.71s -> 3514.44s]  way too hard? Probably not. Okay. Is this one here? Ooh, five grand and only four entries in its B.
[3514.44s -> 3525.24s]  Perfect. All right. Let's rest. Heavy train. Oh no. Fuck it. Why? Heavy train. Who needs to sleep
[3525.24s -> 3538.31s]  when you do this? Remember my wife is divorcing me because I lost all my channel points because
[3538.31s -> 3545.90s]  of Cosmic Andy. What the fuck? Very, very weird thing to be divorced for. I feel like there's
[3545.90s -> 3555.58s]  more going on. I don't think it's, I don't think it's just the fact that Cosmic Andy lost your
[3555.58s -> 3588.50s]  channel point. Okay. Let's go. He was joking. How am I supposed to know that? No, it's all right.
[3591.61s -> 3602.30s]  You're well. That's fine. Let's go ahead and do the mint leaf for your stretch. Please throw the next
[3602.30s -> 3614.94s]  fight so we can get a huge payout on people that are doubters. Eh, I want the money. Sorry. All right,
[3614.94s -> 3623.35s]  I got this week and the next week. So we'll do another big training and then we'll rest and not
[3623.35s -> 3651.37s]  no. Yeah. Don't fail it again. Really? Well, now it's a rest week. Tablets. Just do the A tournament.
[3652.87s -> 3659.99s]  Somebody said that the A tournament might be way too difficult right now. You're ignoring chat.
[3662.57s -> 3672.15s]  Why do you think I read chat? I don't even look. I have not looked at the chat in probably like
[3672.15s -> 3678.33s]  two or three years streaming. I don't even look. I just kind of guess what you guys might be talking
[3678.33s -> 3690.22s]  about. And then I just kind of blend in. All right, we need to rest. We're just going for A.
[3690.22s -> 3699.64s]  Let's go. I don't even care. Train a shitload and we're going right to A. Rest up. Let's go.
[3700.36s -> 3732.22s]  All right, come on. Let's see it. Train. Get over 700 intelligence. Nice. The A tournament will be
[3732.22s -> 3736.78s]  too late for the house upgrade as I've understood it. You have to have the money by the first week
[3736.78s -> 3749.48s]  of March. Level down defense shit. Don't I have the money though? Everywhere. First week of March.
[3749.48s -> 3754.20s]  I have 10 grand. Isn't it like, isn't this two upgrades? I don't have the first one.
[3754.20s -> 3764.38s]  It's 15. I don't have the first upgrade. It's May for the first one. Is this this two upgrades?
[3764.78s -> 3773.74s]  There's a house upgrade and a stable upgrade. It's May 4th. First one is 15k. May not March.
[3773.74s -> 3801.93s]  Oh, okay. Well, I think I'm all right. Yeah, I'm good. I need a press release. It's guilt.
[3803.13s -> 3814.55s]  You need 7k for the first one. Okay, I have that. Press release? No, I said stress relief.
[3817.08s -> 3827.26s]  Ah, shit. We got to do a press release. I got to do a press release. Cosmic Calamity. I got to be
[3827.26s -> 3861.78s]  Cosmic Calamity's PR person. Comes a bit. No, not really. Great. Yes. Come on. Well, that's good
[3861.78s -> 3873.69s]  enough. I need a face cam. I don't need a face cam. You know exactly what I look like. No, you don't
[3873.69s -> 3885.00s]  have to count my nose hairs. You know how what my face looks like right now. I want the stress
[3885.00s -> 3901.91s]  reduction. Official tournaments at the end of the month. Okay, keep going. I need items. All right.
[3903.06s -> 3910.71s]  Make sure I have over $7,000 though. I might actually be getting to the end of the training
[3910.71s -> 3919.16s]  regimen. My understanding here, this is accurate. Eventually they stop getting like really even
[3919.72s -> 3925.61s]  worth training stat increases. They're like less than two or three of them like per stat increase.
[3925.61s -> 3932.55s]  It's no longer. Oh, plus 10 plus 20 stats. It's like plus three. So probably getting close. Maybe
[3932.55s -> 3960.34s]  this one or two more weeks. Yeah, definitely falling out of prime at this point. Heard about
[3960.34s -> 3973.27s]  you from Reddit. Everybody hears about me from every place that I don't participate in. Let's
[3973.27s -> 3988.01s]  do a big one. I close my eyes every time you do a face cam. It's probably a post-it note on your
[3988.01s -> 3997.26s]  screen where the face cam is. 700 intelligence finally got it. Yes. Now I can beat a rank. I can
[3997.26s -> 4015.05s]  just laser beam just lightning melt everybody. You don't participate in Reddit. I read it sometimes.
[4015.69s -> 4022.33s]  I'm not an active participator in Reddit though. 20 weeks we got. We got this one.
[4024.20s -> 4066.54s]  This is a skill. Skill. Rest. A. Nice. 350 or so. All right. Good. Rest. A rank. That's what this,
[4066.54s -> 4080.23s]  I made this title. The title says A rank. So I better beat it. Let me save the game in case
[4080.23s -> 4099.06s]  I get instantly killed and died. You know what I mean? Whoa. What happened? Oh, oops. This is
[4099.06s -> 4108.34s]  the big one. I've never done this before. I've, I've, I used to play this game when I was like 16.
[4109.46s -> 4119.43s]  I never got this far. Played this game again a few years ago. Did not get this far. See if I can do
[4119.43s -> 4127.27s]  this. You could do an air entry and get the sound wave. It's a hundred percent chance at this point.
[4127.99s -> 4157.93s]  Oh, I'm kind of nervous. Kaplan. Kaplan. What is that? Okay. Whoa. 585 speed. Oh god. Only
[4157.93s -> 4172.09s]  200. Okay. I'm never going to hit this thing. Can I even hit this? Oh, I hit you. Oh, I got an onion.
[4172.09s -> 4185.75s]  Oh, an onion ring. I blew his head off. I blew his head off. What the fuck? Oh my god. The force
[4185.75s -> 4197.59s]  buying that one. 30% chance. I had to hit that arrow. It was over. By the way, uh, I'm probably
[4197.59s -> 4204.06s]  going to lose this tournament because we're not going to get lucky again like that. That was a
[4204.06s -> 4209.72s]  pog moment, but minus two. I know. I just, it's, I heard the exact same sound. It was that like,
[4210.92s -> 4235.02s]  I have to fight a dragon. Oh boy. These are all pretty rare monsters. It seems. Dragon. I'm scared.
[4236.65s -> 4249.72s]  Oh my god. 600 power, 600 intelligence. How do you even do that? How do you have that much
[4249.72s -> 4258.70s]  training time to get it there? I think this is a loss. Let's have faith though. Have faith,
[4258.70s -> 4262.38s]  have faith, have faith. Don't let him get up. Do it again. Have faith, have faith. I just beat
[4262.38s -> 4265.66s]  this motherfucker. I just killed him. That was the guy to beat right there and I just won.
[4273.66s -> 4289.85s]  Nothing can stop the laser beam. Those were low percentage chances too. Although I don't know.
[4289.85s -> 4294.82s]  Some of these other things could be high, high intelligence, high power. That was the worst
[4294.82s -> 4306.38s]  possible thing. That dragon just had to do one move and I lose. I'm surprised he's not playing
[4306.38s -> 4311.98s]  the monster rancher DX. This is, this is monster rancher DX. This is the one that just came up.
[4316.44s -> 4327.32s]  Team wall. Yeah. All right. Arculon. This is also 2-0. Arculon. You got a cool name too.
[4337.59s -> 4346.73s]  Wait, this is a robot scorpion hybrid? That thing is awesome. All right. But it's just no match
[4346.73s -> 4355.08s]  for the flip a coin and you die. Oh, I can do the same thing. You know, you know, I can do the same
[4355.08s -> 4375.80s]  thing. It's over. It's over. Shit. Oh, okay. It's still winnable. It is as long as Arculon loses
[4375.80s -> 4400.41s]  once. Okay. More. The dragon won. I'm not the only person that beat the dragon. Just by sheer luck.
[4401.29s -> 4418.74s]  Okay. Lamb sweet. This is a must win scenario here. That speed. This is a must win. Come on.
[4418.74s -> 4444.89s]  Let's go flip the coin. Boy. Oh no. No. We just got lucky on the first two.
[4451.83s -> 4465.21s]  Most people have lost twice. This is not over yet. All right. Arculon needs to lose. All right.
[4466.68s -> 4474.41s]  Okay. It's still doable. All right. Sharkin has not won a single match. So I'm not that concerned.
[4475.13s -> 4496.76s]  How? 60% chance. Let's go. You got that off first. Are you shitting me? You fucking piece of crap.
[4496.76s -> 4503.27s]  Are you kidding me? You saw I was spamming it. Give me a break. I'm sitting here spamming the
[4503.27s -> 4520.15s]  button. Yeah, it's over. I'm just going to reload the save. Through that. I'm reloading the save.
[4529.22s -> 4542.58s]  Okay. If I don't get any prize money, I'm reloading the save. That's not even the move I wanted to do.
[4552.95s -> 4574.12s]  Oh shit. Fuck. I'm reloading. I'm done. I just wanted to see if I could do A rank. This doesn't
[4574.12s -> 4584.52s]  even count. Like I was just checking. It doesn't count. I was checking. We're going back into
[4584.52s -> 4607.77s]  training. You just need to level speed a little bit. Stream title is clickbait. No, it's not.
[4607.77s -> 4628.73s]  I got to A rank. I didn't say I was going to beat A rank. Oh, that's not enough. That's just a waste
[4628.73s -> 4638.86s]  of time. We could have been training. We could have been training. When was the last time I
[4638.86s -> 4643.43s]  saved the game? Oh my God. Wait, I just fed him a potato. When was the last time I've saved?
[4643.43s -> 4669.58s]  Did I save right before that? Oh no. Never feed a potato. Ever. Yeah. Fuck this. Let's go.
[4669.58s -> 4674.62s]  Okay. We're not doing that. Instead. Yes, rank. No, thanks. Back to the training.
[4684.30s -> 4696.97s]  Try just doing air entry. Do B for the money. B for the money. That's eight. That's only three
[4696.97s -> 4704.90s]  thousand for eight. Eight entries. I need the money. That's going to take a long time. All right.
[4704.90s -> 4717.50s]  Fine. Let's just go farm this. Speed run. We don't care about what everybody's stats are. All we
[4717.50s -> 4727.98s]  care about is mashing A and hopefully the beam hits them. These are, these are new monsters.
[4728.62s -> 4742.84s]  All right. This is easy. Whoa. Look at this. I think it's cool. All right. Come on. I've spammed it.
[4742.84s -> 4764.50s]  I've been spamming it. What the fuck? No more swearing. He said, realistically your attack is
[4764.50s -> 4769.38s]  A plus right now in power, but you need either high dodge or defense to counter that RNG.
[4772.86s -> 4777.34s]  Yeah. I think it's probably going to have to be speed. We'll just work on speed for a little bit.
[4778.89s -> 4783.85s]  I'm just going to hammer speed, speed, speed, speed, speed and just make them drink nuts oil.
[4790.10s -> 4798.87s]  I don't think we need. Okay. I don't need any more intelligence. I should solely be focusing on
[4798.87s -> 4823.10s]  trying to get speed over two or three hundred, right? That's it. That's cool looking too. Shit.
[4823.74s -> 4841.38s]  Oh, that's not good. All right. I need to hold back. Try to stay back. Didn't even do anything.
[4841.86s -> 4867.53s]  That was a dinosaur, by the way. That was not even a dog. The T-Rex people are saying,
[4867.53s -> 4886.22s]  what are you talking about? That was a, that was not a lion. It was a stegosaurus. All right.
[4886.22s -> 4909.02s]  This is one hit kill guaranteed. You realize that they didn't sample actual dinosaur sounds, right?
[4909.02s -> 4915.48s]  How do we even know what dinosaurs sounded like? We've given them these crazy big roars,
[4915.48s -> 4929.46s]  the T-Rex roar and big growls. What are they saying? Like birds. I met T-Rex probably was like,
[4933.72s -> 4950.90s]  they were probably birds. Aren't they like descendants from birds? Birds or dinosaurs?
[4950.90s -> 4957.43s]  I'm not, I'm serious. There are a lot of experts that think we have dinosaurs all wrong.
[4958.07s -> 4962.97s]  They may have had just feathers all over them. They weren't like these lizard skinned animals.
[4962.97s -> 4969.24s]  They may have had feathers all over them. Oh, let me just kill this guy real quick.
[4974.74s -> 4980.54s]  Wow. That was pretty, that was a cool move. Come on. I don't suppose we're feathered. Yeah.
[4981.10s -> 4992.10s]  Okay. Wait, let me pay attention because I somehow just got hurt bad. Don't let this guy win. Come on.
[4993.14s -> 5014.36s]  Don't let him win. I just hit him once. 24 guts. Do it. Yeah. T-Rex didn't roar kind of rummed.
[5016.33s -> 5040.02s]  What is rum? The rum? Like that? I didn't mean to do that, but I just got to the end of the coffee.
[5046.60s -> 5055.27s]  Wait, let me take a guess. Is the rumming like this? Like, is that what it might be?
[5060.33s -> 5063.93s]  Kind of like use your throat and your vocal cords with your mouth closed a little bit.
[5068.36s -> 5082.97s]  Like the velociraptors do in Jurassic Park. It's like the rumbling alligators make. Oh, okay.
[5084.38s -> 5095.75s]  I got five health. All right. Let's just insult this person. Oh no. Okay. Good. Did my BM work?
[5096.39s -> 5106.33s]  So you're talking about the sound that it sounds like an alligator when they open their mouth and
[5106.33s -> 5110.73s]  they make a noise. It sounds like they're releasing steam from their body or that they have a gas
[5110.73s -> 5139.38s]  leak inside of their throat. No, that's a hiss. It's a low croak. I mean like this. All of you
[5139.38s -> 5146.71s]  just prepared, just wincing, waiting for that noise. And I even see somebody said minus two
[5146.71s -> 5154.23s]  because you wanted to be the first one to write it, but I didn't do anything. So you look a little
[5154.23s -> 5183.30s]  silly now, don't you? I want one of these big dogs. There's the money. I imagined it and it
[5183.30s -> 5200.90s]  made me cringe. So minus two. Yeah. These take too long just to get three or 4,000 bucks.
[5201.62s -> 5216.07s]  This is too long. I'd rather just train them. I like those little snail guys. How do I get
[5216.07s -> 5231.59s]  one of those? Did you do the fast forward mode? There is a fast forward mode, but I don't want
[5231.59s -> 5234.79s]  to do fast forward mode. I feel like I would accidentally screw something up and I would just
[5234.79s -> 5258.34s]  die. The snail guy sucks. Looks cool. Fast forward is good when you train. The Papa's B cup in July,
[5258.34s -> 5266.31s]  it's worth 9,000 bucks and it gives you pure gold. All right. This has to be the money farm
[5266.31s -> 5281.32s]  character to get ready for the real character. I'm fine with that. Okay. We got the nine speed.
[5281.32s -> 5294.17s]  That's exactly what I wanted to have happen and the health. That's good. I want polish. Yeah,
[5294.17s -> 5310.50s]  you deserve it. This stream is very cozy. That's nice. Sometimes it's fun just to play a game and
[5310.50s -> 5319.58s]  hang out. All right. I need some help from the lore masters. Is tablets still worth doing at this
[5319.58s -> 5332.09s]  point or should I just feed a cup of jelly for the stress? I need some lore master help. Please
[5332.09s -> 5336.97s]  don't try to level speed. Cosmic speed is literally one of the worst in the entire game.
[5337.61s -> 5350.90s]  It's defense is pretty good though. Really tablets is also stress minus. Okay. So wait,
[5350.90s -> 5361.80s]  they have the worst speed in the game. Does that also mean they train the worst for speed? Yes.
[5361.80s -> 5369.75s]  Okay. So then what do I, what do I do? Well, I just have to really rely on just keeping intelligence
[5369.75s -> 5372.79s]  and skill high enough so I can be the first person to attack and kill somebody in one hit.
[5373.43s -> 5384.60s]  Defense is worthless. Defense. People saying defense, but I've heard that defense is not good
[5384.60s -> 5391.54s]  or just farm money. That's why galaxy is bad. So this is why this is the worst character in the
[5391.54s -> 5399.50s]  game because okay, I'm beginning to understand because you can't really level these up because
[5400.30s -> 5410.28s]  he sucks and you get really shit increases when you do. I get it. That's why nobody plays with
[5410.28s -> 5416.20s]  this guy. I need to get a new skill. All right. I'm just going to do air entry. What's there? What
[5416.20s -> 5426.54s]  is it? Let's go for it. Let's do an air entry. It's good. I mean, it's $2,000 though. This one's
[5426.54s -> 5438.71s]  through. Okay. I'll do this one. Just make him the moneymaker. That's a good idea. Yeah. But the
[5438.71s -> 5445.98s]  double beam, as long as I keep using beam raise life is the most important defensive step in the
[5445.98s -> 5457.08s]  game. Okay. So I got a few options here. One of the ways to make this character really, really
[5457.08s -> 5466.15s]  okay is if I keep doing the beam move after I do it 50 times, I can then do an air entry and get
[5466.15s -> 5478.01s]  double beam, but I already kill things in one hit anyway. So two hits. Do I really need the double
[5478.01s -> 5493.72s]  beam? Oh, okay. Look at his gain. His life is D. His defense gain is B. The same as your intelligence
[5493.72s -> 5506.84s]  gain. Life gain is D. Defense is B. You're literally at 49 out of 50 beam usages. Okay. Yes, do it.
[5506.84s -> 5512.25s]  It's content. Okay. That's all I needed here. So I need to do this at the end of the month to just
[5512.25s -> 5521.02s]  to do the 50. He's leaving. He's not leaving. His ranch is huge. He promised a face cam in a minute.
[5521.02s -> 5538.07s]  All right. I'm going to let's do training. I have any more oil. I do just do heavy life training
[5538.07s -> 5557.96s]  then. Or should I just just spam life increase, which is just run, just do run over and over again.
[5557.96s -> 5569.34s]  Do defense, do defense, do defense, defense and life. So just do swim, defense, adult life will
[5569.34s -> 5578.50s]  make him expedition capable. Maybe I'll just swim. I should get it. I'm going to don't swim.
[5581.59s -> 5592.92s]  This is late game. Shit. I don't know what to do. I've never gotten this far. You don't. I'm going
[5592.92s -> 5601.18s]  to do swim. Swim is minus intelligence. Oh shit. You're right. All right. I'm just going to run.
[5601.18s -> 5633.86s]  Just run. Just go run. Meditate only. Oh, yucky. Ugly. Three. Huh? Three. That's it. He's getting
[5633.86s -> 5645.34s]  old. Upgrade intelligence and skill to become an actual one shot sniper. Please train defense.
[5645.34s -> 5664.52s]  Hold on. I need to sneeze. See if I can, can I catch it? Did I get it? Did I not get it? Yeah,
[5664.52s -> 5685.70s]  I did. Didn't I? All right. I don't know what to do. Speed and intelligence. Just keep running.
[5685.70s -> 5693.46s]  Defense is better than you think. It's against intelligence and power. Int and pow just also
[5693.46s -> 5699.29s]  scale damage resistance against themselves slightly. All right. I'm going to go for it.
[5699.29s -> 5718.68s]  Let me see. I'm going to do endure. Endure. Let's check it. Success, right? Four defense. That's not
[5718.68s -> 5733.53s]  good, man. Double beam has worse accuracy and you don't need the damage. Sound wave has the best
[5733.53s -> 5743.59s]  accuracy in the game. Get sound wave instead. All right. Where do I go for sound wave? Just choose
[5743.59s -> 5756.62s]  one with your eyes closed. Sound wave sucks. You guys have a lot of different opinions.
[5756.62s -> 5768.57s]  Should I just send him on an errant tree and who cares? We haven't had a discount in the whole
[5768.57s -> 5775.30s]  time we've been playing. Go to the beach and get sound wave. I'm going to the beach and I'm getting
[5775.30s -> 5795.75s]  sound wave. Rest. Don't miss the house upgrade. Yes. Who is it? You have mail. Look at this.
[5796.70s -> 5812.50s]  Oh, it's errant tree, isn't it? That's not bad though. All right. April. So help me out here.
[5812.50s -> 5826.74s]  When does this happen? The first week of May. So I need to just stay here the fourth week of May.
[5826.74s -> 5837.88s]  So I need to be on the ranch here. So we're going to continue to train or I'll just do this and just
[5837.88s -> 5856.36s]  get money. The video for this stream is going to be five minutes long. That's not like 30 minutes.
[5856.36s -> 5876.06s]  All right. This will be easy money. I need 17k to activate it. Will I have it after this match?
[5878.74s -> 5893.85s]  I was at 12, 13, 14, 15. I'll be at 15. All right. That's not good. How do you 93% chance
[5893.85s -> 5900.04s]  that they missed? Will you fuck off with this bullshit already? Really? Am I actually going to
[5900.04s -> 5909.70s]  lose? No, I'm not. I'm going to get to scream in five minutes to wake that person up for you.
[5910.50s -> 5934.26s]  Oh, it was a single elimination. All right. This one was really easy. What about the toxic monster?
[5934.26s -> 5945.50s]  Yeah, I just have to be able to unlock it. That was a 500 damage crit. I feel bad.
[5957.86s -> 5965.64s]  We need to put a poll in the chat. Very important. Because I can now get the strongest beam move in
[5965.64s -> 5976.73s]  the game, right? I can go get double beam. Do I get double beam, which is more damage than single
[5976.73s -> 5987.34s]  beam, but less accurate? And we actually just go for 30%, 40% kill everybody in one hit. Or do we
[5987.34s -> 5999.62s]  go get scream, which is almost a guaranteed hit, but doesn't do as much damage. I think we need a
[5999.62s -> 6019.02s]  poll for this. I don't know either one I would be fine with. You lose single beam. You do not.
[6019.02s -> 6032.28s]  Whoa, this is getting me more increases than if I were to heavily train the character. Holy shit.
[6034.81s -> 6049.18s]  Do double beam for extra brain dead build. Uh, have some tablets. All right. I got 15 grand.
[6049.18s -> 6060.98s]  What do we got? Looks like pretty unanimously. People do not want double beam. They want scream.
[6070.30s -> 6080.70s]  Just get double beam and then saves come until it works. I forgot to buy this shit. Wait, what is
[6080.70s -> 6089.77s]  this? What kind of seed is this? I don't know. A wholesaler often brings in new items. He said he
[6089.77s -> 6096.25s]  got this at parry parry region. I wonder what seed it is. I've never seen this before. It's not even
[6096.25s -> 6103.59s]  in the textbook. I will give it to you because Jax and cult are my loyal customers. Thank you,
[6103.59s -> 6118.54s]  auntie. What does that do? It grows into a monster. Holy smokes. Do I have to grow it?
[6118.54s -> 6141.30s]  How do I do that? In like three years. Okay. Nevermind. Cause this is going to take a long
[6141.30s -> 6164.97s]  time. It's 10 years actually. Oh, all right. We got, I can't do, wait, there's only four entries.
[6164.97s -> 6177.06s]  Okay. Air entry, air entry. Then we're going for, we're going for air rank again. Air entry. No,
[6177.06s -> 6185.35s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't do that because the, right. Okay. All right. Speed
[6185.35s -> 6206.92s]  intelligence. What do you think? Let's do leap. Power down. Who gives a shit? I need speed. I'm
[6206.92s -> 6212.26s]  not training anymore. There's no reason to. It does so much fatigue and so much stress for
[6212.26s -> 6220.26s]  barely any gain at all. Just have to do the tournaments now. Wait, let's bury the seed in
[6220.26s -> 6227.90s]  the corner of the ranch. I wonder what kind of plant it is. Let's wait patiently and see. Let's
[6227.90s -> 6239.59s]  wait for 10 years. Yeah. Fuck it. I think I'm going for it. I'm going to save here. I'm going
[6239.59s -> 6254.81s]  to rest. We're going to see if I can win. It's only four people. Save the game. I can get lucky
[6254.81s -> 6279.80s]  four times. Hold on. Should I do? Okay. Rest, rest of it. A rank has insanely fast monsters.
[6279.80s -> 6284.78s]  That's all going to be about coming flips. I think I'm in, it's only four monsters though. I did,
[6284.78s -> 6296.52s]  I beat two in a row. I beat two in a row. Dragon was insane. It was horrifying. I beat it in one
[6296.52s -> 6314.57s]  hit at Ray. I beg of you. It's your best move. One thing at a time. I don't remember beating
[6314.57s -> 6320.87s]  any of these people, but we have improved since the last time. All right. It's just, it's flip
[6320.87s -> 6338.86s]  a coin. Let's go. I just have to get it right now. Again. Do it. Yes. Oh, what do I do? Stay back.
[6340.66s -> 6351.77s]  Stay back. Stay back. Stay back. Stay back. Dodge it. Oh, yeah. Oh, dodge it please.
[6352.49s -> 6370.42s]  I have health. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Fuck you. Whatever. You literally only have one chance a
[6370.42s -> 6374.90s]  year to get Ray. It's June 1st. Please do whatever you can to get it. It's the Korea
[6375.54s -> 6410.90s]  expedition. June 1st? I don't even have expeditions. How do I get those? How do I do that?
[6410.90s -> 6422.71s]  They mean Erentria. Okay. All right. Let's get lucky here. Not happening. We need Ray. Bad.
[6423.35s -> 6453.02s]  Holy shit. Okay. Well, whatever. I'm just going to be able to save. Fuck it. Remember the game.
[6456.54s -> 6470.30s]  Okay. So we're not doing that. I still can't do it. I do need to wait till the end of this month.
[6470.30s -> 6485.86s]  So let's just rest or training. How about straight up speed or speed? Just do it. Whatever.
[6485.86s -> 6503.61s]  Oh, that person needs to wake up. Right. Hold on. We help. Plus one. Why even do any of these
[6503.61s -> 6526.17s]  anymore? All right. We got to wake that person up. I got it. All right. Give me one sec. It's
[6526.17s -> 6549.30s]  been two hours, right? It's too early. No, it's not too early. Okay. Let's do. It's four o'clock
[6549.30s -> 6575.29s]  p.m. It's four o'clock p.m. You're up. Turn it off. Turn it off. I hate that alarm. Everybody does.
[6578.34s -> 6585.43s]  I was sleeping. That was not a scream. I'm not going to actually scream and like hurt your ears.
[6592.95s -> 6608.42s]  All right. Just, just go to sleep. Just wake up tomorrow. Here we go. It's about our house.
[6608.42s -> 6612.44s]  You know, people say the might of the house is the might of the trainer. Our house is getting
[6612.44s -> 6620.62s]  too small for us. We have money. Total cost 5,000 gold to renovate the house. Go for it.
[6621.18s -> 6628.42s]  I will ask the carpenter. Jax, this is Binto, the carpenter. He's the number one carpenter around
[6628.42s -> 6635.99s]  here. Stop it, Colt. Although our motto is fast, cheap, and detailed, you will not be disappointed.
[6636.55s -> 6642.65s]  I'll be looking forward to seeing your job, Binto. Oh, but we cannot concentrate when someone
[6642.65s -> 6649.94s]  comes into our site. I have to ask you to visit somewhere while we are working. When we finish
[6650.02s -> 6658.97s]  our job, I'll come and get you. Wait, what do you mean leave? Got it. I asked to stay at the
[6658.97s -> 6666.81s]  Pabbs house, so don't worry. Of course, leave it to me. What does this actually do? How about that?
[6667.53s -> 6673.30s]  Pretty neat, huh? What, you're done already? I told you our motto was fast, cheap, and detailed.
[6673.30s -> 6681.34s]  I'll take the money. Ask us anytime. I don't know what to say. It's a good house, I guess.
[6681.34s -> 6689.03s]  That takes care of all of it, huh? More inventory space. Oh, it is a little house. That's cute.
[6689.03s -> 6700.33s]  Are we sure that it didn't just go in there and move the furniture? Okay, somebody said
[6700.33s -> 6706.07s]  first of June is the most important thing in the world, so I need to sleep here. Wait,
[6706.07s -> 6718.15s]  that's sleeping two days in a row. Wait, getting Cosmic's life to 140 or higher will let you go on
[6718.15s -> 6728.41s]  the first expedition, which can potentially unlock a new monster. I have 140 health. Dude, I got 187.
[6728.41s -> 6744.57s]  Let's go back to sleep. Double rest. I don't care. 187. You meet the requirements. You just need to be
[6744.57s -> 6757.78s]  ready to go next week. All right, I'm ready to go next week. He's nice and rested. I'm going to do
[6757.78s -> 6779.30s]  tablets. Check your house for asbestos and radon. Yes, who is it? Is this Jax's residence? Yes,
[6779.30s -> 6789.14s]  it is. Who are you? Oh, this is my calling card. Oh, here we go. Dr. Talico, Corbel University.
[6789.14s -> 6794.39s]  And what is the purpose of your visit? This is a serious question, dude. Do you have a
[6794.39s -> 6801.42s]  carbon monoxide detector and does it work? Yes, I do. Don't worry. What? Yes, I do. I check my
[6801.42s -> 6811.64s]  smoke detectors, my carbon monoxide detectors. Yes, so don't worry. Okay, once upon a time when
[6811.64s -> 6818.17s]  the world was one big continent, God sealed the monsters into disk stones and hid all the disk
[6818.17s -> 6825.96s]  stones in a shrine. This is when we say put us on the do not call list and close the door. I have
[6825.96s -> 6836.02s]  ascertained that the legendary shrine is located on this continent. Aha. No, aha. It is a great
[6836.02s -> 6842.68s]  discovery. Isn't that what aha means? I must go there. Well, what does it have to do with us?
[6842.68s -> 6849.45s]  It looks like that there are various obstacles on the way to the shrine. I want you guys to go on
[6849.45s -> 6854.38s]  this adventure with me. Pay you and give you some of the items we find during the adventure.
[6854.38s -> 6861.82s]  Huh? In order to get rid of those obstacles and proceed with this adventure, we have to use a
[6861.82s -> 6868.09s]  monster. Strong monster, that is. I came here because Pabs told me. Oh, you know Pabs. You
[6868.09s -> 6874.20s]  should have said that in the beginning. Now I understand. Jax, your monster might get injured.
[6874.20s -> 6885.27s]  Do you make it go with him? You can now get the big dog. Really? Save the game? I don't think I
[6885.35s -> 6904.79s]  can. I can't. You can get a phoenix from this. Um, does it autosave? Okay. Let's go. You don't
[6904.79s -> 6913.62s]  know what's going to happen. Something might injure your monster. Are you sure? Yes. Dr. Talco,
[6913.62s -> 6920.47s]  we can let it go. It's just what I expected. Jax the Wonderful. And can either Caldor or Jax
[6920.47s -> 6926.06s]  come with me on the adventure? I can't handle your monster by myself. You even know my name.
[6926.06s -> 6933.45s]  Okay, I'll go with you. Well done. Let's go. Are we all ready? Yeah. We better take off before you
[6933.45s -> 6942.34s]  change your mind. I'm leaving, Jax. Phoenix Volcano Adventure. Prologue to the adventure.
[6942.34s -> 6958.01s]  We finally arrived at the Phoenix Volcano. First, let's set up a base camp. Let's get started.
[6958.97s -> 6963.98s]  But before we start, let me explain a little about the adventure. At the beginning of an adventure,
[6963.98s -> 6970.89s]  energy points will be given depending on your monster's life status. What? Energy? Yes, energy.
[6970.89s -> 6976.98s]  This energy will be the life gauge for this adventure. The energy will be consumed with each
[6976.98s -> 6982.55s]  step your monster makes. It'll also be reduced if the monster checks the inside of a building.
[6982.87s -> 6995.14s]  Or moves of rock that might be sitting in a way. This girl's confused about everything.
[6995.14s -> 7003.90s]  So always pay attention to your monster's energy level as you proceed with your adventure. Come
[7003.90s -> 7008.95s]  back to base camp while your monster still has some energy points. Wait, let me read this again.
[7008.95s -> 7016.79s]  Come back to base camp while your monster still has some energy points hits minus 10. What's that
[7016.79s -> 7027.32s]  telling me? What's that telling me? If you don't, the monster's lifespan will be shortened. Just
[7027.32s -> 7038.06s]  don't let it hit minus 10. Okay, let's take off. Where do we go? Do I have to do this? Which way
[7038.06s -> 7057.29s]  should I go? This seems very important. Go north? How do I move? Whoa. Whoa. All right.
[7057.29s -> 7078.79s]  Keep going? Where the fuck am I? The path is blocked and we can't go any further.
[7078.79s -> 7087.96s]  Do you want Cosmic Calamity to move the obstacle? Yes. Nice. Okay, you're great. Change the camera.
[7087.96s -> 7110.94s]  Where should I go? Up to the volcano? We're down. Up to the volcano. We can't go any further.
[7110.94s -> 7124.65s]  Move that. All right. Into the volcano? There's nowhere else I can go. Oh, there is an entrance
[7124.73s -> 7133.67s]  here. I smell something in the cave. What do you smell? I don't mean that kind of smell.
[7133.67s -> 7138.26s]  I feel something related to disk stones. Or how can I say? I have a feeling that
[7139.38s -> 7145.14s]  monster's legend may be buried in here. Really? They usually say women's intuition,
[7145.14s -> 7159.80s]  but I guess we should call it doctor's intuition this time. Well, shall we investigate it? Yes.
[7159.80s -> 7171.82s]  Now what? What's that sound? Does it destroy the volcano? What is that thing and how do I get it?
[7171.82s -> 7174.94s]  I want it right now and I want to use it. It's the next monster we're going to use. I want it right
[7174.94s -> 7191.66s]  now. Oh, isn't that the legendary monster Phoenix, the guardian deity of the mountain?
[7191.66s -> 7198.36s]  It's not just a legend. It's real and it's alive. I better let him know about it as soon as possible.
[7198.36s -> 7204.84s]  Oh, who are you going to tell about it? Huh? Oh, never mind. Anyway, it seems like this is
[7204.84s -> 7211.48s]  not the place I'm looking for. I wonder where that shrine of gods is. By the way, I wonder if
[7211.48s -> 7221.90s]  Cosmic Calamity is all right. So shall we investigate inside again? Yeah. What is this?
[7225.51s -> 7232.18s]  That seems pretty far away to me. I just got something. I picked up something. I got
[7232.18s -> 7238.52s]  something. A fucking bunch of bananas. No, come go back in. Go back in right now. Go back in.
[7238.52s -> 7253.46s]  Get it at the top. Nice. Okay, that's definitely it. Get something else too. Fire feather left by
[7253.46s -> 7259.10s]  the legendary monster. If we investigate, we might be able to unravel the unknown secrets of the
[7259.10s -> 7274.73s]  Phoenix. Should I keep going? Do I just pull them out? Leave or are you going to hit minus 10? Okay.
[7274.73s -> 7279.11s]  All right. I don't need anything else from in here. I'm actually really excited. I've never seen
[7279.11s -> 7289.21s]  this before. All right. Let's pull it out. All right. Let's go. I just leave. Pull them out and
[7289.21s -> 7301.27s]  check the HP. I have 65. Should I do it again? Remember, go mix something random with that and
[7301.27s -> 7322.14s]  you'll get the Phoenix. Are you serious? One more? One more. Come on. No, you idiot. All right. Get
[7322.14s -> 7338.41s]  up. You're supposed to have 700 intelligence. I can do it again. One more. There it is. What do you
[7338.41s -> 7353.61s]  got? Oh, what did you get? I got a... No, get out. Now I just leave? If I go straight down,
[7353.61s -> 7372.63s]  will that take me back? I have to go back to the entrance. I can't go down. Yeah, I can't go down.
[7372.63s -> 7393.29s]  I have to go all the way around. I can't go down. I'm okay. 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10,
[7393.93s -> 7410.17s]  9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Oh, I made it. I made it. He's fine. All right. What did we get? We got
[7410.17s -> 7422.28s]  a magic banana, a fire feather, and disc chips. It was quite meaningful. Go back home. Hell yeah.
[7422.28s -> 7427.29s]  Did you tell me I'm going to get to be able to make a Phoenix and then combine it with a weird
[7427.29s -> 7444.41s]  plant monster and make a plant Phoenix? That was a good adventure. All right. We're going to go with
[7445.05s -> 7459.69s]  tablets again. What do we do now? Should I just make a Phoenix? After you create a Phoenix by
[7459.69s -> 7472.17s]  combining, you get infinite more from music tracks. Can Phoenix be combined with stuff?
[7472.73s -> 7490.54s]  Can I make like a cosmic Phoenix? Phoenix can't be combined, but I can pull a Phoenix.
[7493.67s -> 7502.25s]  So I can pull a different kind of Phoenix. Phoenix is only Phoenix or Phoenix plus Phoenix.
[7503.75s -> 7518.14s]  Save the game? I will. There's only three Phoenix types. Okay. Let's go make one.
[7518.14s -> 7555.78s]  So let's freeze you. But now what do I do here? Can I do this wrong? I can do this wrong?
[7556.66s -> 7567.11s]  Oh God. I hope I get it right. Whatever it is. Saved. I did. Get two monsters from the market.
[7567.11s -> 7570.47s]  Combine two monsters and just use the feather. This is impossible to fuck it up.
[7571.03s -> 7584.62s]  Just combine two. All right. Who are we going to sacrifice here? All right. Who are we sacrificing?
[7587.72s -> 7603.32s]  Xbox Series X and Noodle? Batman. Does it matter? Well, the stats are still transferred,
[7603.32s -> 7608.50s]  so a high int monster will give good. Oh, okay. Should I do calamity? Should we just say,
[7608.50s -> 7620.79s]  fuck it and let's go? Bug Batman has high stats. All right. I need, I need a lore master to tell
[7620.79s -> 7627.82s]  me this. If it, if any combination with the feather gets a Phoenix, does it act? If I combine Bug
[7627.82s -> 7633.82s]  Batman and cosmic calamity and the feather, is the Phoenix going to have really like crazy base
[7633.82s -> 7643.06s]  stats? I need a lore master to help me here. Dude. Combination is such a fucked up math problem.
[7643.06s -> 7653.02s]  I can't explain it in chat, dude. Stats will not be transferred for Phoenix. It's a unique summon.
[7653.02s -> 7658.46s]  Okay. Combining is extraordinarily complicated. All right. All right.
[7659.10s -> 7665.85s]  So it just doesn't matter. So we're just going to do two people that we don't really care about.
[7665.85s -> 7669.53s]  I care about Wellington. I don't care about the Xbox Series X. Who cares?
[7673.59s -> 7681.02s]  And Noodle, I don't really care either. Wellington and Bonnie, I think it'd be used pretty well.
[7686.54s -> 7698.02s]  Secret item. Where is it? There it is. Let's go. Let's do it. This one's all up to you.
[7698.58s -> 7709.42s]  Phoenix. Yeah. Phoenix sucks at power, has insane int and the rest is average.
[7709.98s -> 7714.30s]  You'll need to errantry for the int move again, but it only has one non-int move it can learn.
[7715.02s -> 7744.46s]  Ready to face game for this one? All right. Whoa. 170 base health, 190 int. Oh my God.
[7749.69s -> 7757.30s]  Phoenix is the one we saw at the volcano. Well, take good care of it. You have to give it a name.
[7759.66s -> 7771.27s]  A phoenix familiar. Red wizard has got phoenix familiar. Blue wizard is about to die. Red wizard
[7771.27s -> 7794.94s]  needs food battery. Oh, it's definitely familiar. It'll be called familiar. Let's go familiar.
[7795.58s -> 7820.76s]  That's lame. Familiar. Name it phoenix right. No. Long chicken. That is a boring one. All right.
[7821.08s -> 7833.94s]  Yeah, it's boring. Familiar. That's fucking boring. BKLC? BKLC. Burger King Long Chicken.
[7833.94s -> 7866.74s]  Now it's name is BKLC. Shit. It should have been spicy. BKLC. All right. Cool. Wow. I have a
[7867.38s -> 7882.87s]  phoenix. This is cool. All right. So I need to make... Excuse me. Hello. Loremaster of Monster
[7882.87s -> 7889.50s]  Rancher 2 in the chat please. Phoenix. All the monsters have different times where they peak.
[7890.81s -> 7895.53s]  What does the phoenixes look like? Is it early? Is it late? Should I? Because I want to train this
[7895.53s -> 7906.20s]  one correct. At the Britney Spears toxic monster. I can look it up. Oh yeah. I can just look it up
[7906.20s -> 7917.74s]  myself. Right. All right. Game stuff. Game guides. Okay. Monster Rancher 2. Looking for
[7917.74s -> 7926.26s]  monster battle specials. Monster data. Here we go. Monster breed. Phoenix. Phoenix.
[7933.61s -> 7939.21s]  Base stats. Stat gains. So it looks like it gains crazy intelligence. But everything else
[7939.21s -> 7952.46s]  is pretty bad. Okay. You can eat like an iceberg? What? All right. There's an iceberg and there's
[7952.46s -> 7969.53s]  like a dark bird. How do I get these? Spoilers. What do you mean spoilers? The lifespan is only
[7969.53s -> 7982.46s]  350 weeks. If you want to train him well, you're going to need like $15,000 a year. Okay.
[7985.08s -> 7991.43s]  So we're doing heavy intelligence. And what's a heavy intelligence skill? Like build it like the
[7991.43s -> 8001.30s]  wall? Look up. Look. Okay. Well, let, let, let, yeah. Let's take a look. I'm very curious. Let's
[8001.30s -> 8011.27s]  freeze you for a second. Can I unlock a different phoenix now? One build Andy. Can we freeze him?
[8011.27s -> 8036.20s]  It's painful. Okay. Shrine. Fiskstone. All right. What am I looking for? Toxic by Britney Spears.
[8037.16s -> 8058.47s]  Can I actually do this yet? No, it's a rare monster. Okay. Look up. Well, white snake.
[8059.19s -> 8092.82s]  This one was rare. Oh, it's the band. Okay. All right. What am I looking for? Do highway to hell.
[8093.46s -> 8119.42s]  I will snake bite. Where's snake bite? Oh, okay. Let's go. I want, I, what if I want another one?
[8119.42s -> 8127.02s]  Dude, this, okay. All right. All right. All right. Look at this. Look at this thing. So this is a
[8127.02s -> 8143.11s]  unique monster. Oh, no way. 229. What's the difference? But wait, there's probably a
[8143.11s -> 8163.99s]  difference though. So there's a phoenix and then cinderbird. Okay. Let me check. Stat gains are
[8165.77s -> 8175.27s]  CEACCC. I think it's the same as the phoenix. What's the difference though? Besides the base
[8175.27s -> 8184.84s]  stats. Yeah. Same exact stat gains. That's right. 14 movement speed. Same exact thing. Base nature
[8184.84s -> 8193.10s]  90. Base nature 90. Cinderbird is enemy only and it's only available in this version.
[8193.66s -> 8198.26s]  It has 20 more weeks of lifespan. Is that it? It's just a better phoenix. That's the only
[8198.26s -> 8211.11s]  difference. It's just a better one. Okay. It gets extra tech. All right. Very cool. All right. We're
[8211.11s -> 8240.30s]  definitely using this one. Burnt BKLC. I had to use a space. I don't think I can. I don't think
[8240.30s -> 8253.86s]  there is a space. If the phoenix is on fire, this one's like cinder. This one's kind of like burnt
[8253.86s -> 8277.77s]  out. Smolder. Smolder. Smolder? No, I'm not going to name this character burnt fucker. Okay. You
[8277.77s -> 8306.25s]  did that in your game. Smoke? No. Charcoal. Brickette. Brickette. All right. Smolderloin?
[8306.89s -> 8348.90s]  I like Brickette. How do you spell this? Brickette BK. How about BK Brickette? Somebody just called
[8348.90s -> 8367.10s]  me a knob. I'm going to keep Brickette. That's not iconic like Beanbag Sonic. I like BK Brickette.
[8367.10s -> 8378.30s]  Smolder. No, the name doesn't matter. I make garbage names anyways. Brickette is with an E.
[8379.02s -> 8414.09s]  How about Brickette? Brickette. All right. I got to pick one. Briskette. Oh, now I got it. Briskette.
[8424.09s -> 8446.89s]  Briskette. Like that. Get rid of the E. Get rid of the U. Briskette. There you go. Briskette. Done.
[8446.89s -> 8473.90s]  It's with a Q. I'm seriously, I got to fucking move on. There it is. Briskette. Briskette. Got it.
[8474.54s -> 8480.42s]  All right. Now let's just look for some more. Why not? What if I combine? You can't combine
[8480.42s -> 8493.98s]  phoenixes, right? Let me look up a few more. Because there's other monsters to get. You can
[8493.98s -> 8500.30s]  combine two phoenixes. All right. Let me look up a couple songs that I want to look up. We lit
[8500.30s -> 8526.10s]  SpongeBob. I can't get SpongeBob. Give me Neutron. Metal Gear. Oh, Beanbag Sonic. That's right. We
[8526.10s -> 8564.25s]  could get Beanbag Sonic. Although, come on. Okay. Hip to be square. I like it. Wait, what? Where is
[8564.25s -> 8585.18s]  it? What? I won't picture this. How about just Huey Lewis in the news? Huey Lewis in the news.
[8585.90s -> 8611.30s]  Four? Wait. What do you mean four? Do a random one? Random. Nova the album. Okay. Well, Nova the
[8611.30s -> 8642.17s]  album. Ooh. Suizo. Hey, look at this little guy. That's not bad. But I don't want you. How about
[8642.17s -> 8661.67s]  like DuckTales? DuckTales theme. Metal version. Maybe it's a duck. I'm not doing another wall.
[8661.67s -> 8680.12s]  Sorry. And those stats are dog shit. So no, not happening. Meatloaf. Oh shit. All right. How about
[8680.12s -> 8706.04s]  Meatloaf? How about Bad Out of Hell 2? Back into Hell. Uh, we already have one of these.
[8706.04s -> 8726.50s]  I wasn't too big of a fan. Stats are actually kind of good. 157, 157. I might actually hold on to
[8726.50s -> 8756.26s]  this one. Who's purple in the Batman universe? Joker? Nah. But I'm only going to use this for
[8756.26s -> 8763.58s]  a combination, I think. Whatever. Who cares? Lowercase doesn't matter. It's Joker. Goodbye.
[8764.14s -> 8771.08s]  I don't want to run out of space either, though. All right. What else do you want?
[8771.72s -> 8786.33s]  You know the monsters before you take the, uh, Cinderbird? Okay. What do we got?
[8786.33s -> 8796.90s]  You have 20 freezing slots. Okay. Uh, Gangnam Style. I don't think that would be on here.
[8797.54s -> 8815.86s]  Find out, though. It is on here. Which version? Which version? No, not that one. This one. Rare.
[8815.86s -> 8851.11s]  Got the other one? Am I spelling it wrong? Wait, what's happening? Wait, what am I doing? Okay.
[8851.11s -> 8876.17s]  Here we go. This one works. Ooh, one of the dogs. Cool looking. I like the speed. I don't like
[8876.17s -> 8909.00s]  anything else. Sandstorm? Imagine Dragons. Not here. The Rude? No, that, okay. I'm an idiot.
[8909.00s -> 8918.70s]  The Rude is the artist. Sandstorm the remixes. Or, let's just do regular Sandstorm. Rare.
[8918.70s -> 8948.44s]  Try the remix. Um, okay. Definitely this one. Yeah, this one. Really? Come on.
[8948.44s -> 8954.71s]  Tenacious D. All right, what's the one that's...
[8959.99s -> 8980.57s]  It was the... What's that one called? Seinfeld. Seinfeld. Yeah, it's called Tribute. All right,
[8980.57s -> 8995.08s]  where is it? Tenacious D. Ozzy Osborn? How about the Funk Hunters? I like that. Tenacious D,
[8995.08s -> 9009.96s]  Tenacious D, Tenacious D. Where is it? It's not even here. Whatever, what's going on with
[9009.96s -> 9045.29s]  the Funk Hunters? Ooh, a water monster? Strong looking, really. Looks dependable. So it's a
[9045.29s -> 9060.94s]  dinosaur jelly? Water Raptor? This is not bad. It's kind of all around not bad. It's a chaos.
[9065.53s -> 9083.64s]  Um, that's cool, but I don't know if I want it. No thanks. Uh, BBS is Death of a Bachelor by
[9083.64s -> 9112.38s]  Panic at the Disco. Here we go. Time to bring him back from beyond the grave. Beanbag Sonic.
[9112.38s -> 9121.53s]  I love Beanbag Sonic. Speed is so... Beanbag Sonic is unironically very, very good.
[9126.50s -> 9151.54s]  Base health and the base speed are very, very good. We're going to keep... Beanbag Sonic is back.
[9151.54s -> 9181.42s]  Freeze. You know what I really want to find? I want to find one of those apes. 64 intelligence.
[9181.42s -> 9187.61s]  All right, all right. It's time to move on. I want to try to get one or two more decent ones.
[9188.09s -> 9223.11s]  Do Baby Metal's album? Baby Metal? It's Baby Metal. Baby Metal? Baby Metal. Jelly. The jelly
[9223.11s -> 9234.66s]  monster? Is it just jelly jelly? I think it is. How would you ever use this? What? One, two, three,
[9234.66s -> 9262.22s]  four, five, six. These stats are awful. It's just a meme? Oh, okay. What about hamster dance? Hamster
[9262.22s -> 9272.14s]  dance. Did I spell it wrong? Hamster dance? Is it two words? Hamster dance. The hamsters.
[9272.70s -> 9301.99s]  Rare. Jim Carrey? What do you mean Jim Carrey? Jim Carrey pecan pie? What is this? I've never
[9301.99s -> 9310.28s]  heard of this. Oh, it's an ape. It's an ape. It's actually an ape. All right. Awesome.
[9310.28s -> 9333.74s]  What kind of ape is this? Oh, that's not bad. Yes, I want it. Okay. Now, what if we combine the ape
[9334.62s -> 9367.19s]  and somebody else? Ape Ventura. Ape Ventura. I like Ape Ventura. That's a good one.
[9371.00s -> 9382.60s]  Combine the ape with the monolith. Okay. Let's freeze. Let's do a little bit of work here.
[9383.32s -> 9388.23s]  Wait. I want to see what kind of monster this is. Wait. I got to look at techniques and shit. Hold
[9388.23s -> 9405.06s]  on. Ato. Let's see. Okay. Likes jelly. Doesn't like milk. Nature is bad natured. What's the...
[9406.18s -> 9416.65s]  What kind of monster is this? I see the sub monster. This is an ape and something else. Or
[9416.65s -> 9431.67s]  is it just ape? It's just ape. It's ape ape. Oh, okay. So if I combine this, I should look
[9431.67s -> 9439.78s]  for something to do with it. It's just pure ape. Okay. Let's do some combining. I have disc chips
[9439.78s -> 9456.68s]  too. The ape does not have very many subspecies. Okay. Wait, let me save it. I've been doing a lot
[9456.68s -> 9476.70s]  of stuff. Let's make sure I don't lose it. There we go. Very cool. Okay. What can we get? Ape. Okay.
[9476.70s -> 9480.14s]  We've got Burger King, Long Chicken. We can't combine this though. This is Phoenix.
[9481.02s -> 9494.74s]  Brisket. Wellington. Ooh. What about ape Wellington? That might be kind of good. Or
[9498.39s -> 9521.56s]  ape, um, ape Bonnie. No, stop. Stop it. Why not? I think I want to try it. Let's try it. Ape and
[9521.88s -> 9539.45s]  Wellington. Yes. And we'll use some seasoning. Uh, hair? Hono mochi. Ape disc. Should I put an ape disc?
[9539.45s -> 9560.97s]  What would that do? Oh, not with Wellington. Stop it. I don't, why? Crossbacteria is unsure.
[9560.97s -> 9570.01s]  Oh, we're just going to get it. Wait, what? We're going to combine these two and it's just going to
[9570.01s -> 9597.61s]  pop out one of the two? Ape, ape and dog Batman? Bonnie, we'll use, uh, ape disc. This one's up to
[9597.61s -> 9609.08s]  you. Okay. No, no, not anything interesting. Not going to get anything weird. Try it again. Ape
[9609.72s -> 9638.17s]  and beanbag Sonic. We're going to call this Robotnik by the way. Ape disc. This one's all up to you.
[9638.17s -> 9652.89s]  What's a Gaboo? Oh, it's already what this is. No shit. Sonic is a Gaboo. Okay.
[9653.61s -> 9669.77s]  No, I want a different ape. The ape disc is messing it up. Just don't use the ape disc.
[9669.77s -> 9679.77s]  All right. What about ape and, uh, don't use the disc. Ape and beanbag Sonic, no disc.
[9683.83s -> 9689.72s]  Let's see what happens with this shit. I'm curious. We'll do a secret seasoning of,
[9689.72s -> 9708.81s]  uh, hair's disc. Let's go. This combination sucks. And then we'll do,
[9709.77s -> 9720.49s]  this is the only one we haven't really tried. And no seasoning. What the fuck? All right. Fuck it.
[9720.49s -> 9734.97s]  Let's go. This is just for stats. Oh, okay. All right. I'm ready. What are we pulling out?
[9734.97s -> 9744.15s]  I think I have to pull the wall out. Yeah. We're doing cosmic calamity. We're so close.
[9747.54s -> 9766.97s]  Brisket. Cosmic. Should we do brisket? I need money though. No, not yet. I need money. I,
[9766.97s -> 9773.27s]  I need to make another like 10 to 20,000 dollars. Take out bug Batman and let him die.
[9774.07s -> 9789.18s]  Oh, that's right. Okay. Good idea. We're just gonna, we're gonna make money with bug Batman
[9789.18s -> 9808.89s]  until he dies. It's going to be very sad. Everybody say goodbye. We're going to get some money
[9809.78s -> 9817.21s]  out of bug Batman. Kind of a cool monster, but a really, really awful name. Not funny. Just sucked.
[9819.38s -> 9827.19s]  But rest up. The next battle is, uh, we need to do C, right? 3,000 bucks.
[9827.83s -> 9841.80s]  Get some rest. Uh, how come I'm so cruel? Because when a monster dies, you unlock another breed.
[9843.77s -> 9855.46s]  So somebody has to die. Uh, C I would say just to make sure I can make the money.
[9855.46s -> 9880.82s]  There's a lot of fusions with this guy. Somebody has to die though. I got the cinder phoenix.
[9881.62s -> 9898.39s]  That's going to be the S tier monster. Bug Batman style is doting. Yeah. Cause I spoiled this shit
[9898.39s -> 9921.86s]  out of him. It's the first monster we used. I forgot. It's not just one hit Andy. Are we trying
[9921.86s -> 9929.34s]  to kill bug Batman? We're not trying to kill bug Batman. Bug Batman is about to farm money
[9929.34s -> 9935.48s]  and hopefully get to somewhere around 30 to $40,000. We will put bug Batman to rest.
[9936.84s -> 9942.76s]  He will have done his job. Well, Batman seems to not be able to hit anything.
[9950.01s -> 9969.99s]  Oh, I'm in trouble here. I have to swing. I'm dead. I forgot how much this guy sucks.
[9973.46s -> 9995.05s]  The other high level cup today gives 10 K. It does. It's too late. I could just say,
[9995.05s -> 10021.11s]  yeah, I load the same. Yeah. I know. Fuck this. I give up. Yeah. I forget that it's 10 grand.
[10021.11s -> 10032.15s]  There's no way I'm not doing it. The game kind of glitches out a little bit sometimes. All right.
[10032.15s -> 10044.54s]  Let's go use the monster rancher. One disc. The thing dies in one day. Is the one that's 10 grand.
[10045.26s -> 10052.57s]  It's a 10 grand. What are you talking about? 10 grand. Where do you see 10 grand?
[10052.57s -> 10070.65s]  There's no 10 grand. None of these are 10 grand. Pure gold. Oh, this is pure silver.
[10077.58s -> 10117.75s]  Oh, oh, oh. You sell the gold. I got you. Let's feed you some soil. Clean this up.
[10117.75s -> 10132.42s]  I need to do that air entry and get this stupid move. All right. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry,
[10132.42s -> 10137.54s]  hurry. Farm, farm, farm, farm, farm. Instant kill. One, two, three. One, two, three. Dead.
[10137.54s -> 10167.99s]  Very nice. Okay. Okay. Okay. Money. Get some money. Let's go. Watch out. He has psychic scream.
[10167.99s -> 10178.65s]  Just use the speed function. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. How do I do it?
[10179.21s -> 10191.78s]  I think I can enable it from here. It's FF. What does FF stand for?
[10193.26s -> 10212.42s]  Fast fighting. Fast forward. Oh, shit. You're right. Okay. Okay. This is like too fast.
[10212.42s -> 10229.77s]  It's actually just times two speed. I thought this hurts my head. Gold bar.
[10230.33s -> 10244.54s]  Can the gold be used for anything else? Nice. Sure. You're going to have polish.
[10244.54s -> 10264.09s]  It makes gold suazo 1% less stressed. That's so stupid. It feels like it's in slow motion now.
[10264.09s -> 10275.32s]  I'm not doing that again. It's fucking my brain up. All right. I got almost seven.
[10275.32s -> 10288.34s]  So I need 17,000 by what date? How did you get this much money? I'm struggling to get money in
[10288.34s -> 10293.64s]  the game. It actually takes a little while because your first couple of monsters are going to be
[10293.64s -> 10298.70s]  kind of dumpy and you're going to be spending a lot of money just keeping them alive and trying
[10298.70s -> 10306.15s]  to win shitty tournaments. But once you get the one person that can reliably do C and B tournaments
[10307.46s -> 10314.57s]  and you can just kind of make money with that character. So it takes a little while. The first
[10315.13s -> 10320.12s]  six to 10 hours of the game, actual in-game gameplay. I'm not sure if you're like a
[10320.12s -> 10323.80s]  veteran of the game and you know exactly what to do, but if you're just starting, it could be
[10323.80s -> 10329.61s]  a little bit of a curve, especially the training regimens. They're kind of confusing.
[10329.61s -> 10339.75s]  All right. When's the next battle? One here. I'll do that one too. So let's do, I want to do an
[10339.75s -> 10352.70s]  errand tree. Uh, lore masters. When do, when do I need $15,000 by, when do I have to have at least
[10352.78s -> 10373.99s]  15 by July 4th? So literally tomorrow. I need 17,000. It's August 8th. Sell something.
[10381.37s -> 10388.09s]  All right. Is it actually, do I really need to have $17,000? It's May 4th next year, not July.
[10388.09s -> 10402.78s]  Okay. So I have to wait a year. That's fine. So in the meantime, I'm just, I'm going to do an
[10402.78s -> 10413.32s]  errand tree. I have to, I can't just wait for the dumb sale. This guy needs shit. So if I do an
[10413.32s -> 10433.37s]  errand tree now, I will be able to rest. Okay. Let's go do an errand tree. What do I get the,
[10433.37s -> 10449.30s]  uh, the move I want monster is higher than B rank and you can use any location you want.
[10449.30s -> 10472.38s]  Oh, okay. You need to do Korea. This is the place I unlocked Mandy. What's the one to get the,
[10472.38s -> 10487.34s]  the a Korea seems that there is some chance to acquire a new technique here. I want Ray. Okay.
[10487.34s -> 10491.83s]  Let's go for it. Yeah. Let's fight a monster too. One of these,
[10492.55s -> 10509.29s]  you can definitely do at least a C. Oh, unicorn bean bag, Sonic, Harry, Harry. Who could I? Whoa.
[10511.16s -> 10550.33s]  Magma heart. We go for Terry. How about one-eyed? Let's go. Good. Nice. I got it. All right. So I
[10550.33s -> 10568.90s]  think I got Ray crash bandicoot music. It kind of is. Or an actor. Please turn an OST on and
[10568.90s -> 10582.30s]  turn the in-game music off. We're dying. I, that's not unanimous. I think I'm not failing this. This
[10582.30s -> 10613.93s]  is defense training. All right. All right. That's good. So bean bag, Sonic's organs. Holy s**t.
[10613.93s -> 10643.69s]  That looks all right. Please no more clown music. I would like 200 health. I ran a sword. I get one
[10643.69s -> 10683.48s]  of those s**t. Come on, get up. Oh, I got saved by the, nevermind. Get him, get him and then fight
[10683.48s -> 10696.33s]  Terry, whatever his name was. Yeah, that's it. I win. Now we get to fight that weird monster at the
[10696.33s -> 10713.48s]  end. How was that? Like 20 defense? That was pretty significant. Goldy. I should win as long as he
[10713.48s -> 10719.88s]  does an intelligence move and isn't an idiot and just bumps him a thousand times. Let's see. Oh,
[10719.88s -> 10732.01s]  that was okay. Got him. I should have went for one of the B monsters or even one of the A ones
[10732.01s -> 10752.10s]  probably. Great job. Easy battle to win against those guys. Let's go back. Good job. What do you
[10752.10s -> 10758.76s]  actually get for beating the monster at the end? Prize money? Oh, it just lets you get it. Okay.
[10758.76s -> 10778.04s]  Yeah. I remember you get half back. Nice job. Pretty tired. All right. What's that technique?
[10786.57s -> 10799.21s]  Ray. Okay. This is force. So it's hit B. These are all hit C. Okay. At least I'll be able to
[10799.21s -> 10808.90s]  actually do s**t. Withering is B on this as well, which is guts removal, but that's really good.
[10812.15s -> 10817.75s]  Whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's a huge amount of guts to use.
[10819.46s -> 10832.06s]  35 guts? The monster has 700 intelligence. He probably is smarter than any human that has
[10832.06s -> 10837.26s]  ever existed. Yet you force it to fight instead of letting it learn a language and contribute to
[10837.26s -> 10869.93s]  humanity. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's fine. We need some anti-stress and rest. It also greatly reduces
[10869.93s -> 10877.30s]  the enemy's guts. That's true. Maybe I should start with that or maybe that's like an oh s**t
[10877.30s -> 10881.22s]  button. If I miss the first one, just get in close and try to take their guts away so I can stall.
[10887.50s -> 10916.34s]  Need to buy. Oh, overweight. Keep game OST or play something else.
[10916.34s -> 10930.15s]  Sorry guys. That's democracy. The next battle is coming up here and it's three grand and then I
[10930.15s -> 10937.45s]  could try A again. All right. We're going for this one. This one here. So we'll rest up. No,
[10937.45s -> 10942.02s]  we need to do some training, right? Let's do another air entry. F**k it. Let's do another one
[10942.02s -> 10964.76s]  after this tournament, right? No, just double rest, triple rest. I want to see the Phoenix.
[10966.15s -> 10969.83s]  I know everybody wants to see the Phoenix. I do too, but I need to make enough money
[10969.83s -> 10977.56s]  first because the Phoenix is E rank. I got to get to like 20 plus thousand dollars. Once that
[10977.56s -> 10983.91s]  happens, I can comfortably bring out the Phoenix and train the absolute hell out of it with buying
[10983.91s -> 10998.87s]  all these products, doing the air entries. Air entry. All right. Nice. Okay. All right. All
[10998.87s -> 11006.15s]  right. All right. I can learn. Where's the other move? Cosmic limit doesn't look very good these
[11006.15s -> 11042.47s]  days. What? I'm going for A. I'm going for it. Save the game. I guess I f**k up. He's got one last
[11042.47s -> 11063.77s]  fight. He's got more than that. Probably another year. Let's go for it. Four grand. All right.
[11063.77s -> 11073.22s]  Something else to keep in mind. Your no rest schedule you're doing does not work in the new
[11073.22s -> 11078.90s]  game. It reduces lifespan quite a bit now. The new one is harder and RNG based because of magic
[11078.90s -> 11104.55s]  bananas. Really? Really? Oh, okay. Well, magic bananas in this economy. I got confidence we can
[11104.55s -> 11116.49s]  land at least one hit here. 60% get it. I f**king am spamming. Spam it. All right. Now get in close
[11116.49s -> 11122.57s]  and make the guaranteed hit. Get in close. Get in close. It's big. It's bigger hit. Get in close.
[11123.45s -> 11142.86s]  Thank you. 200 and what? Excuse me? Did that much damage? That was insane.
[11143.88s -> 11161.43s]  Did I just do that? No rest method still does work. That's definitely the play is you go for
[11161.43s -> 11165.19s]  the coin flip. If you miss you just get in close and you'll do some withering. That's a lot of
[11165.19s -> 11174.54s]  power. This thing is awesome. What is this whale? It's a bipedal whale. All right. Get in close
[11182.04s -> 11196.70s]  and go. Hell yeah. Okay. Just actually stay in close and do it again. Should I go back? Stay in
[11196.70s -> 11209.19s]  close. Get the guaranteed hit. No. 66%. Give me a break. What the f**k? Heck. 66%. You know,
[11209.19s -> 11217.35s]  you can't even land that and you die. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Back. Back. Back. Back.
[11219.78s -> 11224.42s]  Holy s**t. I actually pulled it off. No, I didn't. God damn it. He has got grit too. Just push him.
[11224.42s -> 11230.47s]  Just bump into him. Bump into him. How much does he hate? Bump him. Bump him. Bump him. Bump him.
[11230.47s -> 11246.46s]  Get in close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Bump him. Who wins? I won? Wait. What? Oh, because I had a
[11246.46s -> 11254.65s]  high... Wait. I don't understand. Doesn't he have higher... Because my health is lower. So my max
[11254.65s -> 11262.58s]  health... Okay. I'll take it. How come I censored myself? Because I promised my mother I would say
[11262.58s -> 11281.66s]  less swear words. That was crazy. Am I going to win my first A Cup? Find out. It's going to be
[11281.66s -> 11327.80s]  tricky. I have to get a big crit here. Oh, that's it. I'm still in it. What? Injured? 2,500? Reload the
[11327.80s -> 11339.98s]  save? Uh, yes. I think Cosmic Calamity is injured. It's not serious, but I'll put it in the hospital
[11339.98s -> 11369.26s]  for fast recovery. It's still in the hospital. Hope it will come back soon. He's fine. All right. Check
[11369.26s -> 11401.78s]  his hate. Hate? Loyalty went down. It's okay. It takes a ton of its life away. Um, wait. I should
[11401.78s -> 11423.56s]  have done the V... I'm reloading the save. Uh, we need a little bit of light training. Why not?
[11423.56s -> 11440.81s]  How about a little bit of dodging? Whatever. Cheating? All right. I promise I will not save
[11440.81s -> 11460.30s]  scum the bird. Save scumming is pretty much required for this game. Yeah, there's a lot of
[11460.30s -> 11477.48s]  heavy RNG. Heavy RNG. Let's make some money. He dislikes tablets, Jeremiah. Yeah. Well,
[11477.48s -> 11482.86s]  here's the thing, though. Uh, according to the experts, it doesn't matter if they don't like
[11482.86s -> 11490.39s]  tablets. It's still the best food to feed anyone, even if they don't like it. What I've been told.
[11500.68s -> 11509.77s]  Hey, pill boys, thanks for the 10. You know what I mean? Community stuff. What's your opinion on the...
[11509.77s -> 11515.02s]  Hold on. What's your opinion on the... What's your opinion on the socio-economic climate
[11515.02s -> 11529.48s]  of Sugandhi's nuts? Um, I've already said the joke for you. I get to make it. You don't. Wait,
[11529.48s -> 11537.34s]  you backed out? He forfeited. That's how you know I'm not supposed to be here.
[11547.00s -> 11567.67s]  You couldn't have put less effort into that. After this, we're going to try... We're going to do
[11567.67s -> 11571.75s]  another air entry. We'll get double beam because that's like the culmination of this whole thing.
[11572.94s -> 11581.67s]  Double beam, try to just RNG ourselves through A rank, and then either let him die or put him on
[11581.67s -> 11602.98s]  ice. All right. It's the biggest crit we've done so far. 517. All I'm doing now is I'm trying to go
[11602.98s -> 11622.73s]  for, you know, long distance home run records. I want to hit like a 600 foot home run. Slow down
[11622.73s -> 11628.25s]  so we can gamble. I don't think gambling right now is a good idea considering I'm almost guaranteed
[11628.25s -> 11658.33s]  to win every single B rank match. What's this item? Manselton? What is that? Nice. Wow. Okay.
[11658.97s -> 11661.56s]  All right. You're almost ready to actually get us to S.
[11665.40s -> 11681.67s]  Get that double beam. Paul is sure you deserve it. Life go up, fame go down. Yeah, that's all good.
[11686.17s -> 11690.02s]  All right. We're looking... This is the one right here. This is the official cup.
[11691.77s -> 11706.04s]  Can I get through this? Heavy. Okay. If you go to the heavy air entry before August
[11706.92s -> 11714.47s]  and you succeed with no injury, you'll be able to unlock Centaur. If you'd rather that than double
[11714.47s -> 11736.82s]  beam. Hmm. Well, August is already over. I don't know. Let's go for double beam. Cosmic's going to
[11736.82s -> 11744.09s]  die soon anyways. Yeah, but I kind of want to see a huge number through Chad's go straight for S
[11744.09s -> 11756.31s]  rank. I'm going to try. Rest up before the... Let's try it again. I have to at least get to S.
[11756.87s -> 11789.37s]  Look at your view count. 13,703. What about it? Big number. He didn't get the joke. Oh, I don't
[11789.37s -> 11799.14s]  get the joke. I don't understand. Who cares? I don't care. I thought I was supposed to get
[11799.14s -> 11810.39s]  something. What am I missing? All right. Come on. We can just luck Andy these people. Save the game.
[11810.95s -> 11820.86s]  Official A rank. Get in there. Feed some items and shit so you're happier. Stress banana. Whatever
[11820.86s -> 11827.00s]  this is. You wanted to see a big number. Oh, oh, that's not, that was not like a joke. That was
[11827.00s -> 11836.18s]  like nice. I can't believe there are this many people here. Hope you're having a good time. I
[11836.18s -> 11843.46s]  love this game. I think it's fun. I think it's worth buying. Thanks for watching. Hi, everybody.
[11843.46s -> 11862.02s]  All right. It's time to save. Sounds good. Battle time. If I got lucky once, I can get lucky twice.
[11862.02s -> 11866.26s]  And if I can get lucky twice, I can get lucky five times. If I can get lucky five times,
[11866.90s -> 11875.77s]  then I just have to hope I place. I have that new move, so I didn't have that last time I tried to
[11875.77s -> 11884.33s]  the official cup. The only one I'm actually afraid of is the one that is that go trick.
[11884.97s -> 11903.61s]  Let's go. This is it. I land the first hit. You're dead. You got to hit. Go before me. Not here.
[11905.34s -> 11923.96s]  And go. Just have to do that a few more times. Finally get to S rank. Although this did happen
[11923.96s -> 11931.00s]  last time. The best part about this, though, is that Dragon is not here anymore. I think the
[11931.00s -> 11949.70s]  Dragon got promoted to S rank. They're not here. We're here the last two times. This is a big
[11949.70s -> 11957.51s]  tournament. All the major tournaments are eight. All right. Lamb sweet. This person beat the shit
[11957.51s -> 11967.13s]  out of us last time. All about it's the speed. It's just the fact that I have a plan and I think
[11967.13s -> 11973.98s]  it was going to go forward. Was it 30%? I have to go for it. It's going to be a shit percentage,
[11973.98s -> 11987.67s]  but I have to do it. I'm fucked. Dodged it. I got grit though. I got grit. I got grit.
[11988.39s -> 11998.63s]  I have to just land one. Just crit for 500 right now. Crit. Dodge. Dodge. Dodge. Dodge. Dodge it.
[11999.35s -> 12011.66s]  I need 24. 24. Kill. Back. Back. Back. Back. Dodge. Whatever. All right. Don't be fucking hurt again.
[12011.66s -> 12047.53s]  That was a crit and it's probably going to be hurt again. Oh, come on. Why? What? What? Yeah.
[12048.25s -> 12109.99s]  He's elderly, dude. Kind of bring out Phoenix. Wait, this is pure silver. Wait, what happened?
[12110.71s -> 12136.44s]  Oh yeah. Okay. Let's get it. 4,000 gold and pure silver. Let him rest. I just gave him nuts oil.
[12137.08s -> 12145.53s]  Nuts oil is essentially sleep in a bottle. That's what it does. That's why during that training
[12145.53s -> 12151.11s]  regimen, I'm able to give nuts oil and they don't have to sleep. What was that? Like weird glitch.
[12151.83s -> 12163.90s]  It's weird. Is this guy going to get his revenge on me? I've one hit killed this guy
[12164.46s -> 12191.00s]  a thousand times. Okay. Very nice. Duelist. Oh no. That's a good name. I like that name.
[12192.18s -> 12213.64s]  Duelist. See, I've been doing, they're all getting hurt probably. Also, you laugh,
[12213.64s -> 12222.82s]  you lose is going to be on Tuesday of this coming week. I think that might be the next stream. I've
[12222.82s -> 12229.43s]  got a lot of stuff I have to do this next few, like three or four days. I wonder if I can sneak
[12229.43s -> 12238.23s]  a stream in on Friday, but we're going to probably, it's not there right now, but we're
[12238.23s -> 12246.66s]  probably going to set up a thing where you guys can recommend you laugh, you lose videos. Are you
[12246.66s -> 12256.26s]  guys seeing that? Why is that happening? You guys saw that, right? The screen like is flickering.
[12256.26s -> 12262.63s]  Is that happening to you guys or is it just on my end? That's weird. It's not happening. Okay.
[12262.63s -> 12272.66s]  So in the discord, just keep an eye over the next couple of days. There'll be probably either
[12273.38s -> 12276.98s]  channel or something, or we'll set up a thing to make it so you can recommend
[12277.62s -> 12285.78s]  some videos to watch. That's also the baby sensory stream. If you have no idea what I'm talking
[12285.78s -> 12290.70s]  about, I'm going to open up a notepad. I'm going to watch baby sensory videos and I'm going to,
[12290.70s -> 12301.53s]  in real time, describe to you how I feel. I'm going to lose. This guy did the same thing last time.
[12309.21s -> 12328.34s]  Come here. God, call it back. Just do it. Go forward. I don't know which way this guy's
[12328.34s -> 12351.13s]  trying to go. Oh my God, dude. Really? What? No, he's three and oh, I didn't even win the tournament.
[12351.13s -> 12368.14s]  What? This guy's getting old. It's over. He's, he's old. I'll take the two grand. That's fine.
[12368.14s -> 12384.20s]  He's old. Okay. That's fine. You did a good job. You made us like 50 grand over the course of the
[12384.20s -> 12411.82s]  last year and a half, three year old birthday yet strong and even much stronger. It sounds like a
[12411.82s -> 12438.55s]  math problem written out as a sentence. Here's your cake. All right. It's time to put him on ice.
[12438.55s -> 12444.06s]  We got to A rank. It doesn't look well these days. I guess we have to consider his retirement.
[12444.06s -> 12460.74s]  Who is it? Look at this. Ooh, let's load up. This is perfect. I'm going to load up a shitload because
[12460.74s -> 12471.24s]  we're going to do the no, uh, no rest regimen. This is perfect. I'm going to buy like 10 of each.
[12471.24s -> 12490.44s]  What can I sell? What is this? Medicine from the Far East life and skill will increase. However,
[12490.44s -> 12509.94s]  speed will decrease. I have too many of these chips. I'm getting rid of one. That's stupid.
[12510.58s -> 12524.94s]  Hey, let's get rid of this stuff. Just sell them. I need at least 80 K for the no rest regimen.
[12524.94s -> 12539.46s]  Well, you can feed these to the monster, sell the chips. That is not that useful.
[12539.46s -> 12551.64s]  Should I really just sell them all? Are they not that useful? No rest is $15,000 a year.
[12552.20s -> 12558.50s]  It influenced the breeding. That's it. Chips are just money. I sell them. They could be used.
[12558.74s -> 12563.75s]  We'll just get rid of them. I'm not going to use them. I'd rather buy the useful stuff to
[12563.75s -> 12579.40s]  do the training regimen because they're all on sale. Did I get rid of the banana too?
[12579.40s -> 12587.05s]  They just favor the breeding outcome. Disrelating to the species. Okay.
[12587.05s -> 12597.56s]  You still has a decent bit of life left. Go get sound wave. It'll carry you to S rank since you're
[12597.56s -> 12624.57s]  into so high. I'll keep the banana. I have six of each. That's I'm at my max unless I get rid of
[12624.57s -> 12631.45s]  these 15 K per year. And you can sub the monster out during the months with the gold and silver to
[12631.45s -> 12640.15s]  get 20,000 ish per year. Okay. You can see a beard on his face. You can. Let me see.
[12640.87s -> 12673.27s]  No, you can't. He has a beard. Let me see. Oh, whatever. Put them on ice. It's time. It's time.
[12673.27s -> 12687.45s]  You did a great job. You made us a lot of money. Bring it out. Phoenix. Phoenix is insane. Where
[12687.45s -> 12712.26s]  are you? Skept. Look at these base stats. They're ridiculous. Let's go. I don't even know what the
[12712.26s -> 12721.53s]  moves are, but I'm really excited. So everything is the same except for intelligence. Intelligence is
[12722.87s -> 12734.92s]  monster gains on this guy. What's, what stat is the least for the Phoenix? Let's find out.
[12735.48s -> 12749.00s]  So there's literally no reason to ever do power. Power is worthless. Stat gains are E, which is
[12749.00s -> 12758.42s]  awful. So intelligence and everything else and don't ever do power. So just everything on
[12758.42s -> 12772.36s]  intelligence and I'm assuming probably speed. What should I do? Let me see. Int and speed,
[12772.36s -> 12782.55s]  probably. Int, speed and life. Int, speed, life and skill, I think is the order. Int, speed,
[12782.55s -> 12800.63s]  life skill. Probably in that order. All right. Let's begin the regimen. Regimen is as follows.
[12800.63s -> 12817.88s]  Regimen is, I need to look up what Phoenix's peak performance is. Okay. So they spend. They're a
[12817.88s -> 12829.08s]  late bloomer, apparently. They hit their prime very, pretty late at their fifth and sixth stage
[12829.08s -> 12837.83s]  of life. So they spend actually a pretty significant amount of time young, but we're not going to see
[12837.83s -> 12853.38s]  very many stat gains. Go for it. All right. Training. You know what we're doing here.
[12853.38s -> 12866.49s]  Real. Editate. Do errantries during the early stages too. Hooray for errantry farming.
[12868.18s -> 12871.62s]  We should go fucking do one right now. Literally. Just let's go right now.
[12872.28s -> 12884.31s]  Errantry immediately. All right. Where's the, I need to get a good skill. What should I look for
[12884.31s -> 12903.74s]  here? Pappas? This dude was just born yesterday. Why are you making him do this? Skill or int?
[12903.74s -> 12915.29s]  Save it. That's so cute. Get a cute name. All right. Let's hurry up. Location. Let's go to.
[12919.46s -> 12936.42s]  I'm going to say probably paripari or torbal for the skill. Or should I do Pappas for the speed?
[12936.42s -> 12951.54s]  I don't know. I'm so indecisive. Cosmic Andy literally lived three years out of eight. Well,
[12951.54s -> 12962.01s]  he's not dead. He's still alive. I'm going paripari. I skipped that text. Sorry. Sorry.
[12962.01s -> 12965.21s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
[12965.21s -> 12969.11s]  I'm just getting very distracted. I just want to fuck. You get one chance to do this. I don't
[12969.11s -> 13003.90s]  want to fuck it up. He's so cute. Don't ever go to Torbal. It's useless. Got it. Oh, I got it. Nice.
[13003.90s -> 13032.26s]  First try. Hell yeah. Didn't wait. Don't do it. These two wings. Fucking idiot. I guess you're a
[13032.26s -> 13053.43s]  baby, but you can definitely do it. That's it. Nice. Good job. You know,
[13055.22s -> 13061.34s]  errant trees might just be what I need to do because you get really, really small, less than
[13061.34s -> 13067.66s]  four, less than three plus when they're babies. I'm going to end up with like plus 20 intelligence
[13067.66s -> 13084.31s]  from this. If I got the money, might as well just do it. They take three weeks of life off of you.
[13084.39s -> 13088.94s]  Oh, okay. These increases are huge though. I'm already almost at 250 intelligence.
[13089.66s -> 13109.93s]  You didn't fight the thing at the end. Nice job. All right. Time for rest. What'd you get?
[13114.78s -> 13128.97s]  Like cedar logs. Best nature. Oh, flame shot. Hell yeah. Force D hit percent A. Force D hit
[13128.97s -> 13159.61s]  percent C. It costs a lot. All right. We need to do stress relief and sleep. Let's rest. I am fairly
[13159.61s -> 13171.75s]  certain that this character will be able just to blow immediately through D rank. 250 intelligence
[13171.75s -> 13195.38s]  already. Okay. What do we got? I think I'm just going to put them into the official cup and just
[13195.38s -> 13207.88s]  skip a couple of grades at school. I don't want to fuck this up though. So we probably should do
[13207.88s -> 13217.00s]  speed. Speed and intelligence probably number one, number two. Or should I just dump into
[13217.00s -> 13227.83s]  intelligence? If you get over 500 intelligence, go to Korea. You'll get the fire stream. Okay.
[13227.83s -> 13269.50s]  Nice job. Tablet time. Take your pills. Take your medicine. All right. It's a new month.
[13270.06s -> 13297.64s]  I'm going to do, let's do oil and then do heavy training. Mint leaf. Is there an intelligence
[13297.64s -> 13305.75s]  and speed? There is. What's more important right now though? Focusing on intelligence or focusing
[13305.75s -> 13325.43s]  on speed? I wonder. Just wait for the loyalty. Hour is going to be irrelevant. So leap is probably
[13325.43s -> 13333.67s]  pretty good for this. Just swap between them. We'll do speed. I'll just jump between them.
[13344.22s -> 13372.86s]  Nice. Very nice. Okay. Now let's do intelligence. When's the battle? Okay. I can do intelligence
[13372.86s -> 13399.83s]  this time and then. All right. Should I even, should I just fuck it and just train the absolute
[13399.83s -> 13418.10s]  hell out of this guy? Try to say guy and bird. And I ended up saying like pie. Okay. Not soil.
[13418.90s -> 13435.13s]  Heavy speed and intelligence. He'll die in a year. Oh shit. I'm going to go for it. Whatever.
[13435.13s -> 13445.96s]  Let's go for it. I'm going to beat the whole game in less than a year.
[13446.60s -> 13490.49s]  Doesn't he just come back? If he's a phoenix. I don't know. I want health too. All right. What
[13490.49s -> 13512.41s]  the fuck did I just do? Okay. We're just doing the intelligence study. But once we get into the prime,
[13512.73s -> 13536.50s]  has it been a BRB yet? No, not yet. I'm too addicted. I can't leave. Okay. Now we do. Oh,
[13537.06s -> 13555.06s]  wait, I need to do oil, right? Yeah. What? I think so. Is this a BR? No, it is a fighting
[13555.06s -> 13563.40s]  one versus one game. Get 300 skill and go to med bay. You can get a strong intelligence mood
[13563.40s -> 13584.70s]  called that's not in this game. I just read your message for no reason. Speed again. Excellent.
[13588.92s -> 13618.10s]  Come on now. That was only plus three. Okay. I'm going to do intelligence just straight up.
[13618.10s -> 13645.66s]  Put on a face cam. All right. You get your face cam after I go to PRB. We'll do this one. I'll
[13645.66s -> 13673.32s]  play. Just to make sure I can do it, right? I'm going to go with meditate. Freddy dread coming
[13673.32s -> 13683.43s]  in with 50 community subs. Holy shit. Freddy. What's up Freddy? How's it going? Thanks for the
[13683.43s -> 13694.58s]  million dollars or whatever that is. Plus one. What is that? Oh, thanks dude. Good to see you.
[13700.06s -> 13722.22s]  So much. Okay. All right. We got this week. We're going to train and I'll rest and we'll do the
[13722.22s -> 13739.61s]  tournament. That sounds good to me. Uh, life too. Maybe sprinkle it in. Not yet. Maybe later. Speed
[13749.85s -> 13770.52s]  brisket has not failed a single training. Not one best nature. I think this is the, I honestly
[13770.52s -> 13775.74s]  really believe that before the stream turns off, we're going to do an insane training regimen
[13775.74s -> 13780.54s]  and this bird will be able to just wipe the floor with everybody. And I'll be able to skip like
[13780.54s -> 13800.74s]  eight. I'll be able to skip to a rank in like 45 minutes. All right. Let's rest. What's CD made
[13800.74s -> 13808.31s]  this? Uh, I had to unlock it by finding the feather in the volcano. And then I forget what song
[13808.31s -> 13832.95s]  actually was to get the cinder. Let's give it a go. All right. After this tournament, I'll go PA.
[13832.95s -> 13860.60s]  Promise. Thanks for reminding me to drink water. It's been like four hours. We can't lose. How do
[13860.60s -> 13869.48s]  you compare? Cause we did skip a whole rank pretty good. Even though we skipped E I'm very curious.
[13869.48s -> 13892.06s]  What are your moves like? Oh hell yeah. That was sick. Hang back. I got, I have high speed. All
[13892.06s -> 13912.26s]  right. Roger. Exactly what you want to see. Roger. All right. Okay. I'm not going to be super
[13912.26s -> 13938.63s]  powerful yet. I know Millium has low HP. There's also a skipping a rank too. Yeah. I mean, if I do
[13938.63s -> 13950.50s]  well here, that means the official tournament, I'll just do D and just skip right to see. Perfect.
[13950.50s -> 13970.63s]  Ooh. Uh, I think I'm just going to do power moves in there and just use beak. Nice. And then again,
[13974.39s -> 14000.26s]  stop doing that. Stop. I'm not doing any moves. There it is. All right. We are capable of doing
[14000.26s -> 14013.11s]  D rank. That's huge. That means the first tournament I do, I should be able to skip right
[14013.11s -> 14031.45s]  to see. And then we can focus on training. I don't have to win tournaments. Take a few bucks.
[14032.01s -> 14052.28s]  Should get a little more than that. I skipped a whole rank. Ooh. I probably should do tournaments
[14052.28s -> 14072.55s]  then. Maybe not the official ones. We'll do the non-official D tournaments. This one's not official.
[14072.55s -> 14078.62s]  2000. I'm going to do that one again. All right. Let's uh, go P. Right, right. Okay. Okay. Perfect.
[14079.18s -> 14287.61s]  See you guys in like two, three minutes. I have returned. Guess what I'm eating. What am I eating?
[14287.61s -> 14310.66s]  Nope. Cliff bar with what kind? Come on. We need to know. Blueberry crisp. Thank you. This is so good.
[14310.66s -> 14326.47s]  It really is. I used to hate these things. I used to think I was chewing on tar. I hated these things.
[14326.47s -> 14331.93s]  I thought they were terrible. I don't know if this is a new formula or if this is blueberry crisp.
[14331.93s -> 14340.73s]  The crisp versions of these are new, but these are a million times better than I remember.
[14340.73s -> 14360.79s]  This is fantastic. You promise to facecam? I will. Have you had a builder bar? No, I haven't.
[14360.79s -> 14384.86s]  Is this sponsored? No, it's not. Have you had a builder bear? No. I don't like that you put a
[14384.86s -> 14400.34s]  heart in it. It makes it like real and weird for me. Nope. It's, I don't know, it's weird.
[14402.89s -> 14407.69s]  When you build a bear, don't at the very end, you put a heart inside and you like seal it up.
[14407.69s -> 14418.55s]  I don't know. That's weird to me. I don't want to, I don't like it. I want this shit full of
[14418.55s -> 14421.11s]  stuffing. That's it. I don't want to put like a, I don't want to do like a freaking
[14422.57s -> 14433.98s]  seance. You whisper into the heart and you can have it have a secret message.
[14433.98s -> 14443.24s]  It's not German. It's a plushie. I know what it is. They're like every mall in America.
[14443.24s -> 14471.35s]  This is so good. Oh, I mean they look like they're high quality. I just don't want to like
[14471.35s -> 14487.37s]  breathe a wish into a heart and seal it inside of the thing's body. All right, let's go. It's
[14487.37s -> 14506.87s]  not a voodoo doll. Facecam? You guys seriously are, come on. Want to see what it looks like?
[14506.87s -> 14529.08s]  What do you think about that? But we need a worst hair candidate, right? It's not enough.
[14529.08s -> 14546.49s]  It's like, okay, you know what's really funny about hair? I look like a mad scientist right now.
[14546.49s -> 14554.36s]  I just made myself handsome. Do you see how fucking weird that is? Mad scientist, scary person,
[14556.76s -> 14572.31s]  handsome young man. Like why? Because I got something on my mouth. It was on my mouth.
[14572.31s -> 14587.58s]  Everyone was just freaked out. I thought I was going to do it in one bite. No, I would joke.
[14587.58s -> 14608.73s]  I'm still young. You're young until you're 50. That I believe. You look like your name would be
[14608.73s -> 14673.69s]  Maurice. I look tall today. Thanks. All right, I'm sick of holding this. Okay, I forgot to talk.
[14673.69s -> 14736.89s]  All right, let's go. Bye smart. I rest yet. Are you chewing a tire? It's a fucking cliff bar.
[14742.90s -> 14768.39s]  It takes ages to eat these. I didn't just bite into like a piece of deli turkey. I'm not kidding.
[14768.47s -> 14816.58s]  I'm still going. Almost done. Yeah, I have plenty of teeth. I guarantee you can't eat a cliff bar
[14816.58s -> 14827.66s]  in like 30 seconds. You'll fucking choke. Yeah, I have more than six teeth. I promise. I like
[14827.66s -> 14863.53s]  drinking on camera. This is a beer. All right, let's go. Show me your teeth. Give me the controller
[14863.53s -> 14877.58s]  while you're eating. I like wood. Training begins now. It's going to be air entry, isn't it? Come on.
[14877.58s -> 14890.74s]  Come on, Gwen. Come on, Gwen. Air entry. Which one do I want to do? Which air entry do I want to do?
[14890.74s -> 14895.61s]  I'm just going to address this person because I think they've written this like 50 to 60 times
[14895.61s -> 14900.10s]  in the last two hours. This game copied among us. I'm just going to say it because I know that
[14900.10s -> 14907.90s]  it'll probably make you stop saying it. I've said it. There you go. Why is my face came so dark?
[14907.90s -> 14913.62s]  Because I... Okay, I was thinking about buying one of those ring lights. Then you'd see what I'd
[14913.62s -> 14936.84s]  really look like. I don't want that. Why did you acknowledge it? What air entry do I want to do?
[14936.84s -> 14961.16s]  Scale one? Okay, it's cheap. Let's go. No, you guys said Torbo was awful. Speed or intelligence?
[14961.16s -> 14975.70s]  Mandy. Go to Mandy. Power in life, though. Pappas. I'll do Pappas. No, let's go.
[14975.70s -> 14993.70s]  Intelligence. You get something called Fire Twister. All right, we can skip this somehow,
[14993.70s -> 15014.31s]  right? I know I'm going to start becoming Skipping Andy. Didn't get it there. Sorry,
[15014.31s -> 15030.84s]  I got another chance. Nice. Give me that skill. Skulled it? Why? All right, didn't get one.
[15030.84s -> 15037.77s]  Your remaining skills are Fire Twister from Pappas and Fire Stream from Korea.
[15037.77s -> 15061.24s]  You need 500 intelligence. Okay. Pappas in Korea. All right, we need to rest. Sleep.
[15061.24s -> 15078.70s]  Just lost an S-ranked tourney by missing a 93% chance. Is this another air entry? Am I going
[15078.70s -> 15088.79s]  to do back-to-back air entries? Oh, all right, this is good. I'm going to use the mint leaf
[15088.79s -> 15110.81s]  right now, though. I'm going to do Heavy Technique. Oh no, I did that wrong. Oops. Oh well. I'll buy
[15110.81s -> 15126.58s]  nut oil instead. Move out of the junk. Disc chips. Burn them. Okay, I'll get another mint leaf. It's
[15126.58s -> 15155.48s]  not what I want. This one right here. Okay, good. We're not peeping any horrors. No. Speed. Speed.
[15155.48s -> 15177.37s]  Ooh, great. Come on. I can't get more than that. I wonder when become... When am I getting to Prime?
[15177.37s -> 15201.88s]  Probably not for a little while, right? I think I'm going to do Meditate. You're an Amazon Prime
[15201.88s -> 15235.80s]  streamer? What are you talking about? Intelligence, just normally. Nuts oil. Do Meditate again. This
[15235.80s -> 15253.32s]  time get it right. Oh, you're going to piss me off. You pissed me off. You pissed me off. Who do you
[15253.32s -> 15268.92s]  want? You have to have 17k for May. Oh shit. We have to unfreeze the wall to make some money?
[15268.92s -> 15286.18s]  What day is it? Okay, we have to bring the wall out to do this C rank because I need to have
[15286.18s -> 15307.88s]  $17,000 to get to this. So I can train here. Can I do this already? I'm supposed to forget what I
[15307.88s -> 15340.68s]  fed them. Please get it right. Good. Good. Good. Looks like the seed we saw has already germinated.
[15340.68s -> 15362.47s]  Ooh, very cool. Well, okay, we're gonna go make some money. Only nine more years. Yeah, that's good.
[15362.47s -> 15369.88s]  Okay, so we have to make this money. Oh, I guess I could. Yeah, I get the 3000. I want some wiggle
[15369.88s -> 15399.62s]  room. I don't want to be broke. Phoenix Prime can take four years. Holy shit. What? Go make some
[15399.62s -> 15425.00s]  money. I actually might just have the wall do this one and this one, right? Like who cares? If he dies,
[15425.00s -> 15440.52s]  then I guess he's gonna die. Do you want to poll for this? This is C rank. Why you put a face cam
[15440.52s -> 15514.50s]  on if we can't even see you? There. You see me? Why would you ever vote against this? He's too old.
[15514.58s -> 15576.01s]  He's too old. Really? I actually lost. 20, 21, 22. Saved. Right at the buzzer. He's just too old.
[15576.01s -> 15601.50s]  He's just sloppy. Scammed. This actually, I'll probably do it in one hit. Maybe another hit.
[15601.50s -> 15619.58s]  How close is he to dying? I don't know. Probably pretty close. Well, to be fair, I am just farming
[15619.58s -> 15624.46s]  money with this guy. This is not... If you're voting at your own risk here, you're betting
[15624.46s -> 15632.06s]  at your own risk. I just want to make sure I have enough money where I'm not going to go broke so I
[15632.06s -> 15668.18s]  can still train the bird. It is free money. You have 750k. 750k what? Subscribers? That'd be weird.
[15673.38s -> 15685.93s]  Oh, it's followers? That's cool. Do you think I'll ever get to a million? That's the one thing. So on
[15685.93s -> 15693.70s]  YouTube, I've moved around too much. So I remember I was approaching like 700 or 800,000 subs on
[15694.26s -> 15707.00s]  German985 on YouTube, and I didn't get there. So I moved on to Twitch, started this channel,
[15707.00s -> 15713.59s]  getting to 750,000. The second channel has 700,000. I wonder if any of these platforms
[15713.59s -> 15720.42s]  will ever have a million. I might get close. It depends on how much longer I do this.
[15722.09s -> 15733.98s]  Third account. Yeah, but I get to say, right? I can say, well, you know, I have over 2.4 million
[15734.54s -> 15739.48s]  followers across his platforms. No, more than that. If you include Twitter and shit.
[15741.00s -> 15749.16s]  I've got over 2.5 million followers across all of my platforms. I can say that. Even though it's
[15749.16s -> 15772.94s]  fucking horse shit. What happened to Cosmic Andy? Cosmic Andy is going to be all right. How about,
[15772.94s -> 15801.45s]  how about it Cosmic Andy? One last A win. You can do it. Only four people. All right, let's go.
[15801.45s -> 15809.34s]  Time for Cosmic Andy to pull it out. This is five more grand. One last one Cosmic Andy. It's not
[15809.34s -> 15836.87s]  even his name. Let's go. So before five or 6,000 and I can solidify Cosmic Andy as an A rank,
[15836.87s -> 15858.97s]  technically S ranked monster. All I gotta do is flip a few coins and win. Let's go. 740 intelligence.
[15858.97s -> 15864.66s]  I'm going to pick my battle here. I'm not going to do anything right away.
[15865.30s -> 15882.94s]  Build up the guts. 34%. It's a big problem. And you drained me of my guts too. He's dead.
[15883.50s -> 15902.38s]  This little shit has won so many times. It's so unfair. I always have to fight this stupid
[15902.38s -> 15912.92s]  guy first. I can still make a few thousand dollars though. I just have to win. This character is
[15912.92s -> 15937.69s]  ridiculous. I just have to get a crit. Pray for a crit. Bounce away. Bounce back. Eat shit. I'm
[15937.69s -> 15944.70s]  going to get money. I actually get money. I think I'll get at least a thousand bucks.
[15947.86s -> 15959.91s]  Got to win one more. All right. Lampsweet wins. I have to beat Kitty. Oh no. Arkealan.
[15960.47s -> 16018.04s]  All right. This is a must win scenario right here. Fuck. 2,000. 200 for third place. What?
[16018.04s -> 16038.76s]  Okay. Put them on ice. Get them out of here. Dude, you're fucking up my schedule. I have to pay for
[16038.76s -> 16057.16s]  the stadium. Whatever it is. What happened? Oh, come on. I have to buy the... It skipped the week
[16057.16s -> 16073.75s]  that I need to build the stable. You know what? Go back to town. Just stay here. You tried. You're
[16073.75s -> 16101.99s]  just too old. I got the money that I wanted from the last one. So we're good. Let's go brisket.
[16101.99s -> 16111.88s]  Okay. We can do a little bit of a rest. How are you? Are you okay?
[16115.62s -> 16137.61s]  Intelligence. Is Brickette tired? I thought birds are supposed to be smart. Birds are supposed to
[16137.61s -> 16150.47s]  be intelligent. Here we go. Better provide the stable first than bread. If the stable is clean,
[16150.47s -> 16157.61s]  brisket can live comfortably. Besides, we cannot train a big monster with a small stable.
[16157.61s -> 16182.62s]  $15,000 to rebuild the stable. Brisket will be very happy. All right. Got it. Now I can get
[16182.62s -> 16209.10s]  huge monsters. Very cool. We got 4,300 bucks. All right. So now we do nut oil. Heavy train.
[16209.10s -> 16223.78s]  I can now get the big dog. Nice. All right. Meditate. Let's go.
[16223.78s -> 16237.64s]  Your receive award submissions close in two hours. That's right. Let's actually talk about that.
[16237.72s -> 16246.12s]  If there's something that you want to nominate, now is the time to do it. And then in a couple
[16246.12s -> 16252.55s]  of days, probably like two or three days over this weekend, I'd say by Sunday, I will put the poll
[16253.11s -> 16259.75s]  in the discord. I'll put it here and I'll tweet about it. So if you have something you want to
[16259.75s -> 16273.99s]  nominate, this is the last opportunity to do it. Have I caught a shiny yet? Not the right game.
[16273.99s -> 16285.26s]  Tablets. There are way too many submissions. Well, like all awards ceremonies, the nominations,
[16285.50s -> 16291.48s]  every single nominee is going to get in. It passes through a filter and some stuff is going to be
[16291.48s -> 16296.66s]  removed. It'll be narrowed down. So don't worry. There's going to be, it's not going to be,
[16296.66s -> 16311.30s]  you're not going to have to vote between one in 40 submissions for the same category.
[16311.30s -> 16344.18s]  Stress reduction. I'm going to do speed. 1984. Not getting increases. Come on. Get into the
[16344.18s -> 16355.10s]  prime of your life already. How old are you? Seven months. How long do they live? When can I expect
[16355.10s -> 16389.27s]  to see a prime here? Five years is prime. Three years. I want more speed. Tell people that when
[16389.27s -> 16392.39s]  they check the spreadsheet to control F and make sure they're not submitting the same thing. Yeah,
[16392.39s -> 16398.47s]  make sure you take, get a, give it a good look. Make sure you're not quadruple submitting the
[16398.47s -> 16421.78s]  same thing. Intelligence. I'm not going to do life until I can actually get good points for it.
[16421.78s -> 16449.37s]  I hope the toucan is getting paid. Should I do the official tournament? Yeah, we'll do this one.
[16449.45s -> 16488.74s]  Remember I skipped the rank, so I'm good to go. 330 intelligence already. Not even in my prime yet.
[16488.74s -> 16500.25s]  I might get this guy to 800 intelligence or more. All right. We'll do the tournament this week because
[16500.25s -> 16518.55s]  I need to make a little bit of money and he'll get stats. You're going to do Mario paint tonight.
[16518.55s -> 16545.74s]  Intelligence again. You probably get 802 stats. That'd be insane. Phoenix has the highest stat
[16545.74s -> 16557.56s]  growth in intelligence. So it will grow super fast like that. Nice job. All right. Let's kick
[16557.56s -> 16583.93s]  some ass. I need to buy more shit. I don't want to blow all my money. All right. That'll be a full
[16583.93s -> 16603.02s]  week battle. You missed somebody who was majoring in bird law. I watch always sunny too. I was going
[16603.02s -> 16625.51s]  to wink at you, but nah, thought about it though. How do we square up here? Really, really good.
[16625.51s -> 16648.71s]  I even have pretty good power compared to this guy. All right. Hold off here. I'm going to farm
[16648.71s -> 16657.69s]  some guts because I don't want to, well, actually stay back. You can't do anything. You used to be
[16657.69s -> 16672.54s]  in the phone. No. Oh, all right. You got to land something, dude. Like land and move 20 seconds.
[16672.54s -> 16708.50s]  There it is. Good dodges. All right. We're, we're good. Clean. Is him defense? Well, that's what I'm
[16708.50s -> 16715.26s]  doing. Speed, speed and defense. Uh, don't work that well together. You should focus on one.
[16715.26s -> 16719.18s]  You can only realistically get maybe three or four stats even remotely increased.
[16720.06s -> 16724.63s]  I could do defense, but defense, I want some of the Lord masters to help me here. Defense, I think
[16724.63s -> 16732.73s]  is the worst stat in the whole game. They fixed that in the remake because defense is supposed to
[16732.81s -> 16745.80s]  be the worst stat in the game. The way that it's calculated is awful. Apparently you're much better
[16745.80s -> 16756.34s]  off just not getting hit and building a little defense. So I'm going to go speed. It fits
[16756.34s -> 16763.62s]  thematically. I'm a bird. I want to go speedy and dodge and fly and come on. It's thematics.
[16763.62s -> 16796.23s]  It doesn't hurt at all. It's a crit. Just let's go for the kill here. Any point you can take in
[16796.23s -> 16802.95s]  defense is better spent on life. Well, especially because life works on the expeditions. So speed
[16802.95s -> 16823.13s]  in life, it'll help the expeditions. Speed is technically defense. I feel like back,
[16823.13s -> 16827.67s]  back in the game here, I'm not just one button Andy. I actually have to move around and worry
[16827.67s -> 16838.07s]  about placement. It hasn't felt like this in a while. I could probably one hit kill this person.
[16838.07s -> 16853.88s]  Actually might be able to do it. Let's see. Don't get cocky. Oh yeah. All right,
[16853.88s -> 16868.54s]  I'm going to go for a talent face. 2000 bucks. What happened to Cosmic? He ate too much shoe
[16868.54s -> 16900.86s]  polish and died. Back to the training. I forgot that was 2000. Yeah. Oh, should I take those drugs?
[16900.86s -> 16928.76s]  Will that fuck me up too much? Will I like get sick? Not bad. Oh, I think I sold it. No, I didn't.
[16928.76s -> 16938.36s]  Where are they? Yeah, this life and skill will increase. Speed will decrease. What is this worth
[16938.36s -> 16955.45s]  it? Does this lose lifespan or should I just sell it? No, it's bad for lifespan. So we're just going
[16955.45s -> 16971.77s]  to sell these. Okay. It seems like all the items are not really worth using because they just bring
[16971.77s -> 16992.66s]  your total maximum lifespan down. 1500. That's a lot of money. All right. It reduces your lifespan
[16992.66s -> 17000.58s]  by five weeks. Your skill and life go up by 10. It reduces your speed by 10. Okay. All right. Let's
[17000.58s -> 17020.73s]  do it. I need to do a little training first, which will do intelligence. What about skill?
[17021.29s -> 17056.82s]  I'll do it. Hit the prime of your life already. I'm going to do an errand tree too.
[17056.82s -> 17082.58s]  Intelligence and skill. Bitchy nose. Meditate. So what am I looking for in an errand tree?
[17082.58s -> 17104.34s]  It was Papa's and Korea. Well, like the heat. Shit defense. You have a Wikipedia page now.
[17104.34s -> 17126.78s]  Only do an errand tree if you have intelligence at 500. Okay. So let's just get it to, let's just
[17126.78s -> 17158.31s]  burn it up to 500. Fire twister. Fire. That sounds awesome. What do you think about Spy Kids 2?
[17158.31s -> 17169.78s]  Um, is that the, is that the shark, uh, boy and lava girl? It's a different movie. Wait,
[17169.78s -> 17191.11s]  that's a different movie. Are you, are you sure though? Are you sure? The same director.
[17191.11s -> 17205.10s]  Spy Kids 3D was the best one. That was an Omega. Oh hell yeah. 17. We're not even in prime yet.
[17205.10s -> 17214.66s]  All right. We have to stop praising cause he's getting a little fond. He's getting a little
[17214.66s -> 17248.58s]  soft. Spoiled. Uh, speed. Pick it. It's a better game. Monster rancher or a wrestling empire.
[17248.58s -> 17271.77s]  That's not fair. They're both completely different things. Focus on skill now. I think we can. Oh,
[17271.77s -> 17280.02s]  I don't have enough intelligence to do this. Do I? Oh, okay. Well, come on. All right. I'm
[17280.02s -> 17293.50s]  going to do the skill one because it's a thousand bucks for like probably 10 to 20 guaranteed skill.
[17293.50s -> 17313.56s]  Do Mandy for the int move. Okay. It's power and life. Oh, should I do, should I just go
[17313.56s -> 17327.16s]  to Torbulent just for the skill or Papas for the speed? Mandy for the move. How much better is the
[17327.16s -> 17352.23s]  move and what I have now? Save. Mandy gives a move guaranteed. Oh, all right. Is it intelligence?
[17352.23s -> 17377.88s]  Is it actually intelligence? Mandy. And let's fight the plate. Yeah. I don't care about the
[17377.88s -> 17380.92s]  tournament cause I'm just going to skip it anyways. Cause this guy's going to be unbeatable.
[17380.92s -> 17389.72s]  Twisters. Let's just drop that. I'm not going to skip it if we haven't seen it yet.
[17389.72s -> 17415.80s]  I love the beam bag Sonic like Pepe dancing. Got it. Are you a monster rancher streamer now?
[17415.80s -> 17422.14s]  I told you this is going to happen until I at least got to S rank. I don't know if I'm going to
[17422.14s -> 17426.06s]  beat the whole game, but I definitely want to get to at least S. I want to, I want it to level up
[17426.06s -> 17433.27s]  at least two or three monsters to like full completion. I'm having fun. I think it's fun.
[17433.83s -> 17484.87s]  Did you make it? Oh no. Did it work? Kind of. Play Digimon world one. I'm not really into the
[17484.95s -> 17494.95s]  Digimon Pokemon. I only like this because it's big numbers. It's a really large scale between zero
[17494.95s -> 17500.73s]  and a thousand. I like the idea of pulling monsters randomly. That can be kind of combined
[17500.73s -> 17515.27s]  randomly. I like the RNG of this game. I don't like the RNG of Pokemon. These are not big numbers.
[17515.27s -> 17527.03s]  Zero to a thousand is not a big number. Digimon one is pretty much at this game.
[17527.59s -> 17535.77s]  Well, all other games don't exist to me. Other games are just not monster rancher.
[17536.33s -> 17545.98s]  Just remake this. Just remake Monster Rancher. Have it be not a remake, but a reboot.
[17547.58s -> 17553.58s]  I don't want a one-to-one just graphical update of the first game. Just reboot the whole franchise
[17555.27s -> 17562.10s]  and instead of there being like a hundred monsters have to be like 500. And instead of
[17562.82s -> 17568.42s]  two types, you'd have like the main type and the subtype. Have main type and like three subtypes
[17568.42s -> 17574.94s]  of something crazy. Don't make it pay to win bullshit either. Don't make it like paid
[17574.94s -> 17579.64s]  bullshit. I don't want to open up like gotcha containers for monsters. Don't do that. Please
[17579.64s -> 17599.54s]  God. I got the new technique. I can't praise. I want to, but I can't. I'm sorry. It's a hundred
[17599.54s -> 17636.02s]  percent would be gotcha if it was made today. Oh no. A to rest. Remember the TV burn person
[17636.02s -> 17655.40s]  updated in the discord. Please look. Are you serious? Wait, hold on. Really? It can't be.
[17656.26s -> 17667.58s]  It can't be. I need to see. I can't tell. Is it still there?
[17675.37s -> 17686.60s]  Okay. Hold on. Hold on. I have to show this. This is unbelievable. No fucking way. No way. I don't
[17686.60s -> 17695.86s]  believe you. This is one of the funniest images. This image is actually really funny because hold
[17695.86s -> 17703.03s]  on. The fact that there's people, we have to dissect this. We need to dissect this right now.
[17706.09s -> 17715.56s]  Okay. Hold on. You got to be kidding me, man. The fact that you're taking this photo, by the way,
[17715.56s -> 17724.86s]  like you're taking this photo, like hidden somewhere, like look, there's no fucking way, dude.
[17724.86s -> 17734.07s]  No, that would be so horrible.
[17740.55s -> 17745.51s]  The best part is the fact that you're taking this from like hidden in the staircase up. I don't know
[17745.51s -> 17750.47s]  where you are, but like, look at these people watching the TV. This image is unbelievable.
[17750.47s -> 17756.63s]  Like the sleeping dog. Like you guys have to deal with this now. You guys have to put up with this
[17756.63s -> 17765.21s]  now. This is unbelievable. What do you mean this is not real? What?
[17778.47s -> 17781.75s]  I mean, can we see the angle here? It looks like the angle is a little bit,
[17784.76s -> 17789.61s]  we need to cross reference the photos. Oh shit. You're right. That's perfect. Let's do some
[17789.61s -> 17805.45s]  detective work. We actually have to cross reference the photos. What are you doing?
[17805.45s -> 17837.27s]  What are you doing? Where's the clock? Is the clock here? It's real. But you can't see the
[17837.27s -> 17843.00s]  clock from this angle, but wait a minute. Look at that. I see the sound bar, same sound bar.
[17843.00s -> 17851.78s]  The console's in the same spot. Dude, let me just tell you, if this is real, this is one of the
[17851.78s -> 17874.46s]  funniest things I've ever fucking heard of. I can't believe that you've ruined your TV. It's so stupid.
[17875.99s -> 17885.43s]  You know, I think we need, we need a little bit, we need one, we need one more piece of proof.
[17886.55s -> 17897.94s]  I need, I need this, this is proof, like real proof. What about the fake reflection?
[17899.29s -> 17903.45s]  We needed, we need another picture, but we need one or we need a video.
[17904.17s -> 17910.42s]  All right, if you can get me a video, if you can get me a video, I swear to God, I'm not
[17910.42s -> 17917.35s]  fucking around right now. I am not kidding around. If you can get me a video where this is real,
[17918.15s -> 17923.11s]  I swear to God, I am not kidding. I will put you in touch with Community Jake
[17923.11s -> 17939.38s]  and I will get you a new TV. I swear to God, this is too funny, but make sure, make sure in your video,
[17939.38s -> 17943.03s]  well, I will have one of the mods take a look at it because I want to make sure you don't,
[17943.03s -> 17956.86s]  you know, no personal information or anything, right? All I need is that TV. God. Okay,
[17956.86s -> 17970.95s]  let's get back to this. I just imagine everybody else that has to watch the TV in this house is
[17970.95s -> 17985.27s]  probably just, how irritated must you be? Was this a new TV? I don't know. They probably hate me.
[17985.99s -> 17997.37s]  Remember, why are all your fans insane? Look, this was an easy mistake. If you get us a video,
[17997.37s -> 17999.93s]  I might, it might be, I might not be able to stop laughing. I might have to leave,
[18000.57s -> 18006.62s]  but definitely make sure if you're going to make, if you actually, if this is not a joke
[18006.62s -> 18011.69s]  and you're actually going to take a video, please, you know, protect your privacy. I don't want like
[18011.69s -> 18014.73s]  your, I don't want to like blow up your spot or anything. You know what I mean? Just we'll,
[18014.81s -> 18019.03s]  we'll have one of the mods look at it to make sure that's absolutely hysterical. Let's keep playing.
[18032.07s -> 18047.64s]  God, look at this air entry again. If this is real, I'll have to probably leave too,
[18047.64s -> 18052.28s]  cause I'll start sobbing. I don't, that might be the most, I don't think we can even nominate it.
[18052.28s -> 18057.56s]  It's literally in four hours, one guy, the year nominations close. I think that we just have to
[18057.56s -> 18081.72s]  give that a pass that like it's, it could be one of the greatest ever. I can't focus on anything
[18081.72s -> 18091.06s]  right now. Having that in my brain. That's so ridiculous. Okay. What was I, what's going on
[18091.06s -> 18138.90s]  item shop? Oh, they are cheaper. Nice. Okay. What was the last thing I did? What about the camera?
[18138.90s -> 18159.98s]  Right. Sorry about that. I'm breathing. I'm fine. What was the last thing I did before that bird
[18159.98s -> 18166.20s]  rested after being stressed. Okay. So now we can just go back to starting over. I want intelligence
[18166.20s -> 18193.08s]  and skill. Go for it. Oh, check that. I got to move. Right. What? Yes. Gold. Hired. What?
[18193.08s -> 18209.27s]  Kind of hate you to be honest. Why? What? I'm sorry. I hate me. I don't want anyone to hate me.
[18209.27s -> 18236.50s]  All right. Skill. Simulate the burning. Oh, I just got like an electrocuted. You even get like a
[18236.50s -> 18256.92s]  chill that just like electrocutes your whole body. Oh, one year birthday. You know, a week from now
[18256.92s -> 18261.16s]  during the you laugh, you lose challenge, the video's not even going to make me laugh. I'm
[18261.16s -> 18265.40s]  going to like see that family sitting watching the TV. It's going to pop into my head and
[18265.40s -> 18291.78s]  I'm going to start laughing for the good work for scat. Seems well. Let's do the stress relief.
[18291.78s -> 18309.19s]  Intelligence. I wanted really hammer intelligence because I got to get it over 500 so I can get
[18309.19s -> 18336.90s]  flame tornado. Nice. Oh, 12 tablets. Always tablets. Nothing but tablets only. All right.
[18336.90s -> 18346.92s]  Dragon quest. I would probably like dragon quest. It's just never committed to it.
[18346.92s -> 18359.21s]  400 int and speed from Papa's. Oh, okay. I'll keep that in mind. I should probably do a. Yeah,
[18359.21s -> 18370.87s]  I'll do a tournament. We'll do this one. Why you always broke every other streamer I've seen. This
[18370.87s -> 18375.94s]  has a lot of money. Well, I had like 20 grand. I just used it. I upgraded the house. I had like
[18375.94s -> 18393.94s]  23,000 24,000. Oh, I'm strict. I got to change that. I really like dragon quest 11 the most
[18393.94s -> 18416.10s]  because you get to see enemies on the map. That's huge for me. Yeah, I got to be less strict.
[18416.10s -> 18424.92s]  Go for it. Oh, I didn't even look at the I didn't even look at the move. You're right.
[18424.92s -> 18435.35s]  Lot of intelligence. I need to get that speed and life up. Oh, shit. It's heat beam. I got to take
[18435.35s -> 18446.76s]  a look at that. Whoa. This character is awesome. That's a lot of guts, though. It's not very good
[18446.76s -> 18475.78s]  percentage. Probably does a lot of damage on dude. Really angry means you're going to miss.
[18475.78s -> 18490.70s]  That's why we build speed. Precisely why I need speed at least at 300 before I even
[18490.70s -> 18496.31s]  attempt C or B. Can you do Homer Simpson impression? I like that show. And I thought
[18496.31s -> 18510.84s]  it might be funny. Yeah, but you can't use that. The submissions are over. You can't use it.
[18510.84s -> 18530.55s]  First, it wins by default. They're afraid of me. Could have said no. Then I wouldn't have offended
[18531.19s -> 18553.00s]  them to leave. I like gatekeep my own new viewers. It's weird. Oh, guys, I'm going to do this thing
[18553.00s -> 18564.10s]  where like a new viewer is going to come and hate me. I do that all the time. I don't want
[18564.10s -> 18567.54s]  anybody to hate me. I just said I didn't want hate. I don't want people to hate me. I really like
[18567.54s -> 18575.10s]  really don't. Look, if you like actually hate me, that makes me like feel like shitty. I like hope
[18575.10s -> 18590.47s]  you really don't. I don't know. People probably do. I don't know. I like hate that feeling.
[18590.87s -> 18609.10s]  Nice. As long as you like yourself. Yeah, I'm very happy and comfortable with me. I am. I'm
[18609.10s -> 18621.02s]  just pretty comfortable. I don't be too much of a dick though. All right. All right. Good job.
[18621.02s -> 18635.72s]  You learn some stuff. Do I have enough items? All right. Rest. When's the new week? All right.
[18635.72s -> 18667.05s]  We'll do a rest. Sleep. Yes. Drill intelligence. I want an air entry. Let's go. I'm sorry for
[18667.05s -> 18689.42s]  calling you broke earlier. I don't matter. All right. Tablets. I'm starting to see
[18689.42s -> 18712.50s]  increases in the amount of stats I'm getting the first time here. What's up? We are well.
[18712.50s -> 18732.15s]  We're going to take a nut oil and then we're going to do heavy intelligence training or do it. No.
[18732.15s -> 18756.42s]  Yes. Make it great. 400. Hell yeah. Now I'm going to focus on skill and speed for a little while.
[18756.42s -> 18782.66s]  Let's go with skill. I'm going to alternate between skill and speed. You can't just dump
[18782.66s -> 18792.65s]  everything in one stat and you're just going to lose. You'll get killed. These increases are so
[18792.65s -> 18825.90s]  small. What are your thoughts on beans? I love beans. Speed. We'll go with this one. I want to
[18825.90s -> 18844.52s]  int and skill from Papa's. Should be good. Ready to go. No tournament. No official tournament
[18844.52s -> 18867.51s]  because I don't want to lose fame for going up or going back down. When's the next battle?
[18867.51s -> 18888.62s]  Not for a while. Not yet. Do I do life? Yeah. I got to sprinkle some life in here. Come on.
[18890.41s -> 18905.54s]  Otherwise I'm going to be a little like weenie. Here we go. Play Hearthstone Battle Royale.
[18906.42s -> 18918.94s]  I have 150 wins in first place in Hearthstone Battle Royale. Wait I made that up. I don't think
[18918.94s -> 18935.61s]  that's a lie. No I have 150 fourth place or higher ranks and like 50 first place wins. I had like
[18935.61s -> 18954.23s]  five or six thousand rating when I cared. 5200 or something? 5100? Win one right now. I can't.
[18954.23s -> 18960.06s]  The only way you could. No I couldn't. You have to play that shit every day and every time they
[18960.06s -> 18967.88s]  make a new update you have to play it because as of now there's been 10 new characters and like
[18967.88s -> 18977.56s]  40 new cards. I'm just getting my ass kicked for like a week. All right more training.
[18977.56s -> 18995.26s]  What was the last thing I did? Oh fuck it whatever. All right speed and intelligence. No
[18995.26s -> 19019.26s]  intelligence and skill. I will never stream Hearthstone ever again. I'll never stream it
[19019.26s -> 19054.90s]  again. Are you going to play Peggle? Nah. What about Yu-Gi-Oh? Nah. Good job. Oh really good job.
[19054.90s -> 19071.59s]  Hell yeah. 11 points. All right when I get I do a lot of spinning like this. I was just spinning
[19071.59s -> 19089.58s]  around in my chair. It's probably distracting I'm sorry. Speed and intelligence again. Not getting
[19089.58s -> 19112.41s]  hit sometimes is almost more important than getting hit. Than getting hits. Do not eat a magic banana.
[19112.41s -> 19131.51s]  Oh it's a glitch. Do list of the roses. It's chess combined with Yu-Gi-Oh. Sounds pretty good. Speed
[19131.51s -> 19145.16s]  again. What's a game that you could confidently speed run? Uh I actually tried to do Mario 64
[19145.16s -> 19152.26s]  recently just in my own time. Uh I was able to do the bomb glitch through the wall where you go
[19152.26s -> 19159.05s]  like yeah what and you grab the bomb and boom through the gate. I did it a few times but then
[19159.05s -> 19164.17s]  I realized it took me like two or three hundred attempts to do that like while I was just sitting
[19164.17s -> 19177.61s]  on the couch. I said I'm not I don't want to do this ever again. I don't have the patience for it.
[19177.61s -> 19191.45s]  I just don't. That's not a fake story. I could probably do it right now if I really sat there
[19191.45s -> 19214.47s]  for like 10 to 20 minutes. I'm not kidding I could probably do it right now. Do it right now?
[19214.47s -> 19234.92s]  You want me to do it right now? Thinking about it. I'm thinking about going and getting the switch.
[19234.92s -> 19239.78s]  And yes I'm I did it on the switch and I have everyone says don't play it on the switch. Switch
[19239.78s -> 19341.42s]  has input lag. That means I did it on the switch with the input lag. With the Joy-Cons. Okay uh so
[19341.42s -> 19354.87s]  look what I already have a save point right here. I already have a save point right here. Why would
[19354.87s -> 19362.84s]  I have a suspend point there if I wasn't doing this? Huh? What do you think? You want to see
[19362.84s -> 19376.87s]  something fucking happen on this stream? I'll show you the practice that I've had. Move this out of
[19376.87s -> 19393.19s]  the way. Can you see? Can you see it? All right you can't see it. Hold on let me. I let me move this
[19393.19s -> 19405.51s]  shit out of the way. I how am I gonna be able to do this shit? I'm gonna I need the dock. I need the
[19405.51s -> 19412.78s]  dock. I actually think I need the dock for this because I'm gonna be like uncomfortable. Let's
[19412.78s -> 19435.05s]  punch again. Okay uh let me see. Let's punch. I need the I actually need the dock. You ready?
[19435.05s -> 19571.50s]  Here we go. Fuck. I fucked it up. Fuck. I'm getting the dock. I'll be right back. I'm not
[19571.50s -> 19610.34s]  ready yet. Why can't I see it? Plugged in. Put the music on. All right here you go. I'm doing this on
[19610.34s -> 19617.37s]  stream right now. It's gonna be so like scuffed. It's gonna be terrible looking. Okay I need a
[19617.37s -> 19634.04s]  the video capture device. What the hell is it? We're gonna add video capture device. What the fuck?
[19634.04s -> 19665.88s]  Hello? What just happened? Can you see me? Can anybody hear me? What the fuck is go-
[19666.04s -> 19780.55s]  What the fuck is happening? Dude I swear to god. I swear to god. Can you guys hear me? I just I went
[19780.55s -> 19790.66s]  live to try to go to come back and this shit was like somebody's already live on your channel. It
[19790.66s -> 19794.74s]  was like oh yeah there's a connection error trying to stream to this. My screen was like black. That
[19794.74s -> 19806.44s]  was weird. What the hell? The VOD's probably so fucked up now. All right let's go. I'm going for
[19806.44s -> 19816.06s]  this right now. I'm gonna get this. I swear to god. That was that was really really weird. All
[19816.06s -> 19824.95s]  right hold on. Sorry about that. I'm back. Give me give me a second. Ask me what the fuck that was.
[19836.70s -> 19842.38s]  Okay let's do this. It's not going to be perfect but I have to desync myself.
[19851.40s -> 19854.17s]  It's not going to be perfect. Just relax.
[19859.69s -> 19870.68s]  Okay there we go. So now I have to put this on this tv. All the- I'm swear I'm gonna get it. I
[19870.68s -> 19876.28s]  swear to god. What a viewer drop. Well I mean the whole stream fucking exploded.
[19876.28s -> 19897.08s]  He'll be back. Don't worry. He'll be back. Okay let me just plug this in here. Watch this shit.
[19897.08s -> 19902.98s]  You ready for this? You ready?
[19921.80s -> 19932.46s]  Fuck. It's just end point.
[19956.76s -> 19971.61s]  God damn it. I get it. I fucking hate these little things.
[19976.02s -> 20005.72s]  Yes. My knees. I swear to god I've done this like three or four times.
[20014.26s -> 20024.25s]  I'm gonna smash these into a million fucking pieces.
[20024.25s -> 20046.09s]  I'm getting the controller. I'm getting the real controller. I'll be back.
[20046.09s -> 20072.89s]  Oh my fuck. I forgot. I just leaked the dashboard. Now you all know I bought this.
[20072.89s -> 20080.46s]  And I wrote like a tweet saying this thing but I would never buy it.
[20088.92s -> 20111.48s]  Hello? I have to re- oh change grip and order. Stupid fucking thing.
[20111.48s -> 20126.60s]  I'm gonna get this or I won't turn the stream off. Let's go. Can you guys hear it? Is it loud?
[20178.86s -> 20182.74s]  Fuck you game. Oh it says I'm playing Monster Rancher. This is wrong.
[20182.74s -> 20205.80s]  It's gonna- I'll get it in a second. We'll go right back. Oh what?
[20205.80s -> 20227.72s]  What? No!
[20249.90s -> 20301.21s]  Hug the wall? Oh fuck you. That was it. Oh that was gonna be it. Damn it.
[20325.58s -> 20356.39s]  Gamer card deactivated. Not yet. I had it so close. God damn it. I hate this game.
[20356.47s -> 20365.22s]  Did we break a thousand? Wait there's not even a thousand viewers here? What happened? What?
[20365.22s -> 20397.67s]  I don't even have a thousand viewers? God. It's ten thousand? Okay. I've gotten it before. I
[20397.67s -> 20447.85s]  swear to god. Dude this dude's past his prime. 30. Past his prime. I'm 36. Oh my god. Believe in me.
[20456.41s -> 20461.54s]  Mario goes like this to turn around. Oh it's the fucking dumbest thing. I hate this game.
[20488.74s -> 20514.60s]  Oh wait a minute. I think I'm supposed to do that. Fuck you. It's chat. What's going on in chat right
[20514.60s -> 20533.22s]  now? What are you guys doing? You suck. I don't. Stop. I'm gonna say losing viewers. Say gaining
[20533.22s -> 20558.58s]  viewers so I get confidence. What happened? That was it. Oh my god. I could never do this.
[20592.22s -> 20600.31s]  How many viewers are here? Losing viewers.
[20625.61s -> 20634.63s]  I give up. I give up. I give up. I give up. I give up. I give up. I can't do it. I give up.
[20634.63s -> 20644.23s]  I actually can't do it. I give up. Just ground pound the pole. No. No. You don't. That's not
[20644.23s -> 20704.22s]  what I'm trying to do. Oh fuck. You explode already. That was the one. You fucking idiot.
[20704.22s -> 20734.20s]  Yeah. All right. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Did you tell that I've been practicing?
[20736.73s -> 20754.28s]  I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.
[20754.28s -> 20763.54s]  I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. That's it. I'm done. Fucking practice makes perfect, baby.
[20764.10s -> 20776.39s]  What else we got? What else have I been practicing? How about this one?
[20788.15s -> 20810.41s]  All right. So we're gonna play Monster Rancher again. Never playing fucking Super Mario ever
[20810.41s -> 20834.89s]  again. What the fuck happened there, by the way? My stream crashed three times. I told you I was
[20834.89s -> 20855.10s]  gonna do it before the stream ended. Fix this. Fix that. You earned it. Well, now I have to do
[20855.10s -> 20871.42s]  that in like 17 and a half minutes. We're back. We're ready. I don't remember anything that just
[20871.42s -> 20889.70s]  happened. Sorry for the crashing. Should not be a delay anymore. What do I wanna do now? Why are
[20889.70s -> 20897.99s]  you angry? I wasn't angry. I mean, I was angry at Mario 64. You just blacked out for the whole
[20897.99s -> 20903.21s]  thing? Okay. What was the last thing that I did? Which has been breaking a lot today. Actually,
[20903.21s -> 20928.15s]  that hurt. Yeah. I heard that too. I think I rested. Let's just go. Oh, here we go. Right.
[20928.15s -> 20932.71s]  All right. Let's do, um, we'll rest and then we'll take, uh, brisket into the fight.
[20933.35s -> 20956.68s]  I'm glad I actually got to prove myself. I want the skill points. This should be pretty easy.
[20961.26s -> 20979.85s]  I need to turn the switch off. I love Jerma, but I just can't enjoy his non-Super Mario 64 streams.
[20979.85s -> 20992.98s]  He should just stick with what he was good at. That's so stupid. You know, I was thinking,
[20992.98s -> 20999.40s]  you, okay, there's a deeper reason as to why I was practicing that. I wanted so badly just to
[20999.40s -> 21006.20s]  go live one day with splits and actually really desperately try to get like sub 25 minutes.
[21007.88s -> 21019.42s]  Just to just not tell you guys at all. But then I saw how much actual work skill and dedication
[21019.42s -> 21037.90s]  it takes to do that. And I threw that idea out the window. All right, let's farm here.
[21037.90s -> 21064.06s]  That takes so much guts and I don't even know if it's worth joining. I'm going to kill. Oh,
[21064.06s -> 21072.57s]  not quite like I got a headache from that Super Mario thing. Did I really think I was going to
[21072.57s -> 21079.37s]  be able to hold it this way and do that? You got to be kidding me. I was just too lazy to get the
[21079.37s -> 21100.62s]  dock. Can I have a turn or am I just going to keep doing this? Any more question? Are you all
[21100.62s -> 21117.45s]  right? Yeah, I'm good. What are you talking about? I feel great. How long have I even been streaming
[21117.45s -> 21139.30s]  for? Six hours. We'll keep going for a little bit. Six hour Andy. Yeah, I am a six hour Andy.
[21139.30s -> 21155.74s]  He's actually really funny because I'm, when I was bringing the switch here, it was open on YouTube
[21156.70s -> 21163.02s]  and I was, I must've been, I don't, I don't even remember. I was really tired. It was, it was like
[21163.02s -> 21168.12s]  an XQC playthrough. Like he was playing something like a horror game. And I was probably like, oh
[21168.12s -> 21177.48s]  yeah, get scared. I was literally, that's what was open. I must've been watching it last time. I had
[21177.48s -> 21195.08s]  the switch open. Juicer. I can't say I'm a juicer. I'm a juicer. What's wrong with that?
[21195.72s -> 21205.98s]  You know, the best part about being like a new juicer is this like 600 years of XQC streams.
[21208.57s -> 21223.86s]  I got a long way to go. It's like, oh wow. Look at all this. Look at all this. It's here. Stop
[21223.86s -> 21243.08s]  calling yourself that you weirdo. I got a lot of fame for that. Very good. Very good. Already have
[21243.08s -> 21263.66s]  more health than the entirety of our training for Calamity. Still on the grind? Not really. I just
[21263.66s -> 21278.62s]  like having fun. Remember, you're not allowed to like other streamers. He's cheating on us.
[21279.18s -> 21292.70s]  Remember, you doing that Mario 64 bit gave me anxiety and a stomach ache.
[21293.34s -> 21315.50s]  All right. Good fight. Good battle. Yeah. You guys kept talking about peep the horror. All of a
[21315.50s -> 21320.54s]  sudden you see a Mario 64 horror and you leave. I lost like, well, that doesn't, that's not fair.
[21321.56s -> 21328.79s]  I lost 2000 people because of the crash. That's what I'm going to tell myself when I'm taking
[21328.79s -> 21340.74s]  a bath later crying. All right. Let's go for it. Training. Grill. I want speed and intelligence.
[21340.74s -> 21357.59s]  I want speed. When are you going to do a snowman stream? I don't know what you're talking about.
[21365.83s -> 21369.85s]  Tablets. Always. Tablets when you're doing the training regimen.
[21370.65s -> 21376.39s]  It doesn't really snow in Vegas. Not really. I need to move this camera though. It's wrong.
[21377.94s -> 21382.10s]  It does not really snow here. Maybe, maybe once a year or once every couple of years
[21382.10s -> 21397.24s]  there'll be enough to see. But not really. I love it here though. It's really, really cold
[21397.24s -> 21403.66s]  and really, really hot. During December, January, February, it gets to be 30, 40 degrees here
[21403.66s -> 21412.54s]  Fahrenheit. I like it. It's kind of like a chilly dry. I like it a lot. We're going to be able to
[21412.54s -> 21420.50s]  get the new move. And then in the summertime it gets like 110, 115, 118 degrees Fahrenheit. I love
[21420.50s -> 21438.22s]  it. I'm just, I'm a weirdo. All right. Okay. Let's do mint leaf and then we're going to do
[21438.22s -> 21446.41s]  the errand tree. And I want to do Papa's errand tree, right? You miss Boston? Um, sometimes. I
[21446.41s -> 21450.52s]  miss the people in Boston. Not necessarily the place. It's kind of how it is though.
[21459.53s -> 21475.88s]  Papa's is where I can get the tornado move. It seems that there is some chance to acquire
[21475.88s -> 21488.84s]  a new technique. I can definitely handle. Yeah, this one. I don't care about the tournament.
[21488.84s -> 21493.42s]  We're going to skip it anyways. You're going to bed now. Good night. Well, have a good night.
[21496.14s -> 21499.58s]  Yeah. I'll probably won't stream for that much longer. Once we hit six plus hours or so,
[21500.22s -> 21506.04s]  which means you're going to have to see monster rancher too again, which I'm fine with.
[21507.10s -> 21529.90s]  Got it. Got the skill chapstick. Is this a burst piece? I'm only 30 minutes in. Oh, that's right.
[21529.90s -> 21542.39s]  The screen crashed. Start raising skill. Yeah. Once I get to speed, cause I'm going to hammer
[21542.39s -> 21550.47s]  skill. Once, uh, I get into prime, but I really do want like 300 speed and like four or 500
[21550.47s -> 21555.75s]  intelligence before I hammer skill. Cause I'm going to just pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump
[21555.75s -> 21562.57s]  into skill. Once I get, um, out of the kind of adolescent stage. What's the flavor? Uh,
[21562.57s -> 21571.13s]  the flavor of this bird's bees is coconut and pear. It's pretty good. All right. Let me take a look
[21571.13s -> 21586.52s]  at the moves that this guy has. I actually do need to do a tournament though. Why you do
[21586.52s -> 21593.80s]  chapstick so much? Well, uh, because my lips get really dry and I have this sort of tendency
[21594.78s -> 21615.22s]  constantly be like all the time air entry again. Oh no, that's good. I'll take it and honest. Oh,
[21615.22s -> 21630.22s]  very tired. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'll get some rest. I'm going to ask you about your dry
[21630.22s -> 21648.15s]  lips every stream. Yeah. I'm pretty much a lizard. I do need to buy some items. Don't lose all my
[21648.15s -> 21662.23s]  money. I will be pissed if I do. Can I sell something? Why is the plant one 1500? Is there
[21662.23s -> 21676.31s]  an update on the TV yet? I don't think so. I don't think we have a TV update. Is a good reason why
[21676.95s -> 21684.90s]  I saw Connor choke you the other day. You all right? Yeah. I was, it was uncalled for.
[21684.90s -> 21691.05s]  He's reached over and start choking my neck as hard as he could. I was like, what the heck, man?
[21691.69s -> 21718.39s]  I need the money. I need the money. How many I'll buy a couple more. I can only buy one more.
[21718.47s -> 21735.58s]  All right. That's fine. Have you eaten today? Yeah. I've eaten twice. Okay. You need to rest.
[21736.14s -> 21751.03s]  What did I have to eat? Well, you watched me eat a cliff bar and then earlier I had a coffee
[21752.49s -> 21763.82s]  and some air. So I actually didn't eat at all. I was lying. Battle today. No, I need to train.
[21764.54s -> 21782.17s]  Be life. Should I start? Not yet. What is wrong with streamers? Um, I'll tell you what's wrong
[21782.17s -> 21788.12s]  with streamers. A lot of us don't really want to eat on camera and the prospect of eating
[21788.12s -> 21795.80s]  like a dinner on camera or on stream, uh, it's kind of hard to talk and it's kind of hard to,
[21796.52s -> 21802.49s]  but okay, if I were to eat, it takes me probably like at least 15 to 30 minutes to eat dinner.
[21803.05s -> 21810.71s]  So I would have to like go BRB for 30 minutes, maybe 20 to 30 minutes. And I mean, if you're
[21810.71s -> 21818.49s]  talking about people watching the stream, I think you just saw the stream crashed for about
[21818.49s -> 21824.41s]  two minutes and two or 3000 people left. So if I disappeared for 25 minutes,
[21824.41s -> 21836.31s]  how many people would still be here? I wonder. Have dinner with us. Well, that's another thing
[21836.31s -> 21844.33s]  too. Like I don't stream long enough to hit that problem, right? Like, okay, if I have,
[21844.33s -> 21847.93s]  I usually have something before the stream. I usually be like a salad or like a light
[21847.93s -> 21851.05s]  breakfast or something, or like a lunch or something before the stream, which will,
[21851.69s -> 21858.68s]  my streams are only five to six hours, five to seven hours, which that's a decent enough time
[21858.68s -> 21862.04s]  where I don't really need to eat. I have plenty of water and sometimes I'll snack on something,
[21863.50s -> 21870.50s]  but, um, I guess if you're streaming like eight to 12 hours a day, you can't, you have to eat on
[21870.50s -> 21876.58s]  stream. Um, but if you stream less than six hours or seven hours a day, the prospect of kind of
[21876.58s -> 21882.82s]  taking 20, 15 to 20 minutes to eat, um, is like, you're kind of live and I'd rather scream because
[21882.82s -> 21890.06s]  I only stream for five hours or so and I wouldn't want to waste like 30 minutes of that eating food.
[21890.06s -> 21918.41s]  Get it? Don't yell at me, please. I have 90 loyalty, very, very loyal. This time I'm going
[21918.41s -> 21923.88s]  to do, I'm doing it again. We're going heavy, double heavy. I'm messing up the regimen here,
[21923.88s -> 21939.21s]  but I want to do it. I want that 500 intelligence. Bingo. All right. Now we focus on skill and speed.
[21939.85s -> 21971.26s]  Seem like you're the kind of guy that chews ice. Sometimes kind of fun. Depends on how big it is.
[21971.82s -> 21992.39s]  I like chewing a little bit of ice. I need to do a tournament. I'm not constantly doing it.
[21992.39s -> 21997.77s]  If I have a little drink that's, let's say I drink a soda, there's ice in the cup and I get to the
[21997.77s -> 22003.53s]  bottom of the soda and there's three or four little ice crunchies that are as big as little,
[22004.33s -> 22021.03s]  um, like chiclets. I'll just go, I'm not eating ice cubes, almost a hundred loyalty. This is a big
[22021.03s -> 22052.30s]  deal. I'm going to do skill and we'll go back to skill. So what would you guys say is a good
[22052.30s -> 22069.53s]  speed number to be able to hang at a rank? 300, 400, like 350, 450, 400. Oh, the tree's growing.
[22069.53s -> 22106.63s]  Oh, the lore master's left. Is the entire game pretty much just RNG? Um, kind of. It's pretty
[22106.63s -> 22116.50s]  much RNG, but it's fun. I'm going to run out of money. I need to do, all right, I'll do the
[22116.50s -> 22134.76s]  Gemini Cup. We'll rest. Oh yeah. I need to do the monster rancher one thing. Yeah. I'll do that
[22134.76s -> 22140.87s]  before I turn three months, so I don't forget. Does fame do anything? Fame increases your crit
[22140.87s -> 22149.30s]  strike chance. It's the bizarre back of the, in the data of the game code. I don't know why. It's
[22149.30s -> 22165.59s]  just, if your fame is higher, it's tied to your crit chance. Let's get some money. Is this baste
[22165.59s -> 22172.89s]  or fringe? Rotisserie chicken is the best chicken. I would say that's fringe. Bastetake would be
[22172.89s -> 22198.86s]  a, like fried chicken breast for a chicken sandwich. That's pretty fringe. Uh, it's looking
[22198.86s -> 22225.19s]  pretty good. I really need to work on skill. Skill and life. Yeah. I need skill bad. God,
[22225.19s -> 22237.16s]  keep picking this one. That move was not hit once. 74% chance. Am I actually going to lose
[22237.16s -> 22259.72s]  to Millium? I'm going to lose to Millium. Finally. Jesus. There's an update? Is there,
[22259.72s -> 22273.74s]  is this video proof? No, this is not. Don't fucking tell me. Are you serious? I don't see it. I don't
[22273.82s -> 22289.91s]  see it yet. Hold on. I need to show. This is funny. It's not, no, no, no. It's something else. It's
[22289.91s -> 22295.59s]  something else. Something else. It's funny too. Wait, they said so in the discord. I don't see it.
[22295.59s -> 22308.97s]  I need a mod to like vet that video and make sure like it's good if it's real. There's something
[22308.97s -> 22349.18s]  else I want to show. This is so funny. This is like actually me. It's my face. What's wrong with me?
[22351.16s -> 22364.97s]  Yeah, there he is. I just like want to go watch his stream. All right. Do we actually have a video
[22364.97s -> 22371.83s]  update? If we do, then I'm ending the stream because it has to end after that. I'll keep an
[22371.83s -> 22398.97s]  eye on the, on the mods. It's not, it's in the works. I can't, I can't believe it. It's real.
[22398.97s -> 22414.10s]  It's currently in transit. They have to finish rendering it? What do you mean,
[22414.10s -> 22424.63s]  what do you mean rendering it? Cell phone, film, and then send. What do you mean rendering?
[22424.63s -> 22440.14s]  I don't know about this one. I don't know. I'm not so sure about this one. There we go. Double tap.
[22440.14s -> 22455.58s]  You got to be patient. Okay. I'm patient. I'm going to be very patient. I mean, I'll tell you
[22455.58s -> 22462.44s]  what I'm looking for in that video. I'm looking for like a turn the TV off, turn the TV on and
[22462.44s -> 22468.86s]  like from at least three different angles. You know what I mean? Like, like it can't be doctored.
[22479.51s -> 22507.02s]  Unplug the TV. I'm mentally preparing for whatever this is. I want to hit him with this move.
[22508.20s -> 22518.52s]  I don't even know what it looks like. Oh, they might be uploading it to YouTube. What they said,
[22518.52s -> 22529.99s]  rendering. You got to have somebody walking in front of the TV. Oh shit. Like a body crossing
[22529.99s -> 22544.12s]  the plane of the television, right? Oh, it was a joke. Okay. I'm telling you, if I get undeniable
[22544.12s -> 22559.03s]  proof that that's real. Oh my goodness gracious. It's crazy. Part of me thinks that that's just not
[22559.03s -> 22577.80s]  possible. What TV is he talking about? He's talking about this. I never mind. I'm talking.
[22577.80s -> 22588.55s]  I, I, whatever. I thought it was this. I forgot to replace the image with the XQC image. 47 fame.
[22595.72s -> 22626.22s]  Ooh, nice. Very, very good. Very good. XQC is burned into my Nintendo Switch. Somebody said,
[22626.22s -> 22633.27s]  dude, I don't think it's real. They said, I don't think it took years for the Cartoon Network
[22633.27s -> 22651.70s]  logo to get burned into my TV. What? Yeah. What kind of TV do you have? Do you have like a liquid
[22651.70s -> 22670.62s]  crystal plasma TV from like 2002? I'm getting more and more skeptical by the minute. Oh,
[22670.62s -> 22695.77s]  LEDs have burning. I'm freaking out. I got to calm down. Okay. We're good. I'm going to lose my mind
[22695.77s -> 22702.68s]  if it's real. There's a piece of my brain that's like Jeremy. It's not going to be real. So don't
[22702.68s -> 22750.81s]  worry. It's just a joke. Speed. No, skill. I got a message from, uh, I got a message from, from,
[22751.53s -> 22761.03s]  from VR Josh. VR Josh says, Hey, check your DMs. So, uh, it's not real, dude. Uh, it was a Rick roll.
[22761.03s -> 22767.82s]  I'll leave it up to you how you decide to tell everybody. I was about to buy a motherfucker,
[22767.82s -> 22784.34s]  a new plasma TV. All right. I knew it wasn't real. No way. Your TV from like,
[22784.42s -> 22799.94s]  your TV has to be from like 2003. No way. No fucking way. So what the hell? What, where,
[22799.94s -> 22807.16s]  what, where were you? What is the picture? Is that actually your living room and you just doctored
[22807.16s -> 22833.10s]  it? I'm so confused. That's so funny. I want to look at it again. Oh, I thought you wish it was
[22833.10s -> 22840.97s]  real though. Like that's so perfect. The original image. You guys are such fucking jokers. I swear
[22840.97s -> 22853.05s]  to God. The original image is this for those of you that weren't here a few hours ago,
[22853.05s -> 22870.81s]  there's a message in the discord and it said this. Where is it? I'm home for the holidays
[22870.81s -> 22873.93s]  from college. I decided to watch some German. You just, you can read it. I can't read it. It's
[22873.93s -> 22885.00s]  gonna make me laugh. That was a good fake up. That was great. Yeah. Now thinking about it. This is
[22885.00s -> 22903.48s]  way too detailed rendering. Oh yeah. That was pretty good bait though. You had us all rolling.
[22903.48s -> 22914.87s]  You had, you had, you had the whole group fooled for like four hours. That was great. I nominate,
[22914.87s -> 22921.93s]  I nominate that for best one guy of the year. So I'm going to give it a stamp of it's already
[22921.93s -> 22930.71s]  one of them that wins. So it can't get nominated because it's going to win. I was really hoping
[22930.71s -> 22938.50s]  we were going to get a fucking video though. Even if it was fake as shit. Time frame. It probably
[22938.50s -> 22946.63s]  would take a little while. All right. What the hell am I doing here? Official D. I'm going for
[22946.63s -> 22972.14s]  official D. Let's do a little bit more training. Skill. Now I want a big skill. Is there a big
[22972.14s -> 22977.58s]  skill? Power, speed, defense, and intelligence. No, there's not a big skill. We're just going to
[22977.58s -> 22985.40s]  do it this way. What if somebody actually burns your face into their TV on purpose? Well, I talked
[22985.40s -> 22991.56s]  about that earlier. I ain't replacing any TVs. If you go and buy like an old LED TV and you burn
[22991.56s -> 22995.48s]  my face into it and you go, dude, you owe me a thousand bucks for a new TV. I ain't going to
[22995.48s -> 23000.60s]  give it to you. I already talked about it already. That was legitimate. I was going to, I was about
[23000.60s -> 23007.30s]  to have that person contact community Jake to like get that TV and replace it. If you break
[23007.30s -> 23010.58s]  any of your shit and you play, I didn't do it. And I'm telling you right now, I'm not replacing
[23010.58s -> 23024.38s]  it. If you do, let's just make that dead serious clear. Imagine if, imagine if they faked it so
[23024.38s -> 23032.97s]  well that they got like a fucking $1,500 TV out of that. I would think you would have deserved it.
[23032.97s -> 23049.35s]  Yeah. You would deserve it by that point. Absolutely. If a TV has a prize, that effort
[23049.35s -> 23055.11s]  should warrant a new team would have to be warranted a new TV. You got to respect the grift.
[23055.67s -> 23063.38s]  All right. When's the battle after this battle? I'm going to probably, I'm going to take off.
[23063.38s -> 23073.45s]  I'm going to get some food. No, don't intentionally burn a TV. Don't intentionally burn in a TV.
[23073.45s -> 23079.70s]  Don't do that. No, it's this, the bit was funny. The bit was cool, but I don't, I don't want to
[23079.70s -> 23085.22s]  wake up like on Friday afternoon or something. And there's like 30 images in the discord of like
[23085.22s -> 23089.62s]  people burning their TVs. And don't do it. I'm not even going to click them. I'm not, I mean,
[23089.62s -> 23104.52s]  I'm not going to click them. Nope. The joke's over. Joke is over. I need to do mint leaf.
[23105.16s -> 23120.52s]  That's so goddamn funny. Wait, what the fuck are you talking about? You look like you smell salty,
[23120.52s -> 23130.98s]  not dirty, salty, but just straight up like sulfur. I smell like, like the end of a creamed corn can
[23130.98s -> 23136.89s]  when you dump it out and you just go like this and you smell it, which actually smells kind of good.
[23148.66s -> 23153.85s]  Ooh, excellent job. That's going to be at least 10 to 15.
[23155.38s -> 23180.23s]  Oh, all right. Okay. Okay. Let's do it. Official D over to C. I never do that voice again.
[23180.23s -> 23192.89s]  People beg me to do that voice on a monthly basis. I feel great if it drinks from this, really.
[23193.53s -> 23206.17s]  Grandma, can we get one more before the nominations close? That wasn't even nominated. Oh my God.
[23206.17s -> 23223.72s]  That wasn't even a category. What am I thinking? It was, it was. Okay. It was. I don't think it is.
[23228.87s -> 23234.95s]  All right. Adding another category. We're adding it Ooh, category. Last minute category. You have
[23234.95s -> 23246.42s]  two hours to figure it out. It might not even show up. I bet you can't do Toy Boat for one minute.
[23270.31s -> 23277.29s]  One, two, Toy Boat, Toy Boat. One, two, Toy Boat, Toy Boat. Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat,
[23277.29s -> 23282.73s]  Toy Boat. Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat,
[23282.73s -> 23309.20s]  Toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat
[23309.94s -> 23311.94s]  Toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat
[23312.76s -> 23323.46s]  Lost my mojo. How do you spell? I was gonna do a really love
[23327.56s -> 23328.42s]  I
[23328.42s -> 23332.21s]  Could probably do it. No don't need to be nominated. I'll do it. Perfect. I'm never doing it ever again
[23332.73s -> 23338.97s]  I'm gonna get it. Perfect. Just wait
[23339.57s -> 23342.71s]  I'll get it. Perfect
[23345.56s -> 23390.02s]  don't even nominate it for anything i already did the best one because i'm leaving um don't
[23390.02s -> 23396.12s]  make it a category i'm not gonna don't make a category for it oh he's so wacky oh he's like
[23396.12s -> 23409.10s]  the wackiest guy in the world it already was a category no it wasn't i thought it
[23409.10s -> 23422.17s]  all right i gotta go i need to get food in my body i want to see what this move looks like it just
[23422.17s -> 23456.34s]  sucks heat beam damage mosquitoes after that oh you're gonna hit me okay fine he's delirious
[23456.34s -> 23464.39s]  i think uh the mario 64 part of the stream took like 10 years off my life i smoked like 400 packs
[23464.39s -> 23488.20s]  of cigarettes right there like an hour ago that was an errantry can you talk while inhaling at
