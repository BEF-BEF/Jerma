[0.76s -> 6.94s]  Does anyone dare to challenge me? Figures. What is that? Rips the hilt of my...
[10.39s -> 23.74s]  Hey, how you doing everybody? Welcome. Welcome to the stream. Oh, gamer has logged in. On time.
[24.38s -> 30.86s]  Wait, what? Why do people get... why do people... residents sleep during when I'm on time?
[31.74s -> 36.81s]  Is it because you like hanging out in the chat so much and you like chatting without me here?
[37.37s -> 46.50s]  I can... I understand that. You're 15 minutes early. No, no, no, no. I am 15 minutes now.
[47.38s -> 55.94s]  It is now. There is no late. Between 3 and 4 p.m. There is only now. If it was 4 p.m. 401,
[55.94s -> 69.24s]  that's late. If it was 259, that's early. 3 to 4. Now. There is only late. All right,
[69.24s -> 71.64s]  give me one second. I'm gonna make a tweet and we're gonna talk about some stuff. We're
[71.64s -> 77.35s]  gonna go and let a little stuff talk. Not very long. Maybe like five minutes. Not even. Not
[77.35s -> 157.21s]  even. All right. Okay, so I was talking with your mother last night and we have decided
[157.21s -> 161.29s]  that we're gonna bring this up in a respectful, nice way. We didn't want to, you know,
[162.09s -> 170.25s]  alarm you or anything, but your mother and I were cleaning up the house and we found
[170.89s -> 180.18s]  a bag of marijuana and I know it's not mine. It's not hers and we've already talked to
[180.18s -> 184.74s]  Jacob about this. So we're just coming to you in hopes that you can maybe
[187.05s -> 206.87s]  shed some light on what this is. I learned it from watching you. Well, the character...
[206.87s -> 212.63s]  Listen, and this is tough. I know that, you know, you're 14 and it's tough to understand,
[213.35s -> 221.99s]  but that's a character that I play on television. The character, it's not real. I'm an actor
[222.71s -> 228.79s]  and I play a character that's... Think of it like recess. When I go out and I do recess
[228.79s -> 235.27s]  with other people doing recess and it's filmed and then it's put out as if it was real.
[236.57s -> 240.89s]  You know, my stoner personality that I put on that show is not something you should be doing.
[244.95s -> 250.15s]  He's RPing with chat. Yeah, what the fuck am I doing? I am like, we're just like role playing.
[250.79s -> 260.31s]  But how are you? Hope you're doing well. What we were really going to talk about
[262.07s -> 270.78s]  is today. What's happening today? Look, this is what's happening today.
[270.78s -> 278.31s]  Gonna do Might and Magic again. We're dialing it up to a million. We are going to do an
[278.39s -> 292.02s]  8v8v, no holds barred, large map. I ain't fucking around today. I've already picked
[292.02s -> 299.56s]  who and the music's not even on. What kind of streamer am I? Drop the house lights, please.
[299.56s -> 308.74s]  Thank you. And bring it up a little bit. There it is. So today we're going to... I've
[308.74s -> 317.43s]  decided I'm going to be green again. You guys aren't even dancing to this music. All you
[317.43s -> 322.76s]  can do is put your hands in the air and like move them like this. I can't fucking turn
[322.76s -> 329.40s]  the webcam on. My hands are in the air with my... Okay, I'm going to describe it. My thumb and my
[330.36s -> 335.72s]  middle finger are together on both hands. They're both in the air and I'm... Okay,
[335.72s -> 342.12s]  almost like I'm making like a kick the field goal here with my arms. And my hands are
[342.12s -> 349.64s]  swaying back and forth. Wrist turn in towards head. Wrist turns out towards the outside.
[350.86s -> 363.56s]  One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two. Make the music louder. Why would I do that?
[363.56s -> 371.82s]  I should be dropping it. But I don't care. So we're going to do this today.
[374.02s -> 377.94s]  I'm... This is the last stream for a little while. For at least a couple days. Probably
[377.94s -> 383.94s]  three days. Because I have colonoscopy coming up here in a couple days. I'm kind of
[383.94s -> 389.24s]  foodless at the moment. Like I can't really eat that much. I can't eat anything tomorrow.
[389.24s -> 393.40s]  I have to not eat for 24 hours before the procedure. And I can't really eat that much
[393.40s -> 399.48s]  today. So I might lose a little bit of energy here. And when that happens, I'm
[399.48s -> 406.18s]  going to have to leave. So I'm going to go as long as I can with like no real energy.
[407.83s -> 416.46s]  What procedure? Colonoscopy. Colonoscopy. Yes, I can drink coffee. That is a thing.
[417.02s -> 423.40s]  I can have chicken broth, coffee, jello. And I think I can have like just nothing really
[423.96s -> 431.02s]  heavy. No high fats. I can't have anything with seeds in it. With skin. No berries. No
[431.02s -> 438.62s]  strawberries. No beans. Nothing like that. But we're gonna, we're just gonna go. So please
[439.58s -> 448.33s]  excuse my low energy here. No, I'll be fine. I'm like, please excuse my low energy.
[450.26s -> 456.02s]  It's like going into like work and talk to your boss. Excuse my low energy today. I've
[456.02s -> 466.25s]  got a colonoscopy in a couple days. It'll be good. But yeah, that's happening. This is
[466.25s -> 472.87s]  the last stream for a few days. And then let's go. Let's just go. I decided to pick. I know
[472.87s -> 476.79s]  you guys are looking at this going, Hey, what the hell? How come you, what I wanted to pick.
[476.79s -> 484.49s]  You should have let me pick. But I felt like going with a fortress. They looked pretty good.
[484.49s -> 497.14s]  No lizard man, serpent fly, Gorgons, Wyverns, Hydras. I like this. And of course I had to pick
[497.14s -> 507.14s]  Voi. Because Voi looks the most like Otto. This kind of looks like Otto in the morning when
[507.14s -> 511.18s]  he puts his head under the blanket. Districts like Otto too when he has his head under the
[511.18s -> 522.81s]  blanket in a different angle. All right, so we're gonna do, we're gonna start with
[524.18s -> 537.72s]  Wyston. No, not this guy. You want to be this guy? That's just like Vincent Van Gogh.
[537.72s -> 545.94s]  What is he doing here? You have all these monsters and actually, well, there's, there's another
[545.94s -> 550.34s]  person here. But I mean, like, why is Vincent Van Gogh in the middle of like two Ottos,
[550.34s -> 556.42s]  like dragons? It's the Burger King. It's not, uh, now you've said the fucking Burger King.
[558.65s -> 572.47s]  It's like young Prince Burger King. It's Burger, it's a young, it's Prince Burger King. All
[572.47s -> 579.32s]  right. It's a Beastmaster. I don't know what that even means. Everybody else who cares?
[579.32s -> 589.62s]  This is on the map Warlords. I have no idea how this is gonna play out. We're gonna
[589.62s -> 595.99s]  stay on the same difficulty. We're not gonna, we'll do 130%. Just a little bit on the higher
[595.99s -> 601.06s]  scale, but that's okay. That's what we do. The only way to lose is to lose everything.
[601.06s -> 610.89s]  The only way to win is to kill everybody. Can you turn off taxes? Uh, I don't think
[611.69s -> 631.90s]  this scenario does that. Battle Royale. Yeah, I think I'm ready to go. Are you ready? Wait!
[632.62s -> 636.20s]  Lower the difficulty? No, it's, it's okay. It's okay where it is. I just made some
[636.20s -> 652.87s]  mistakes. One. Three. Oh my god, this is gonna take forever. This is a huge fucking map.
[652.87s -> 658.65s]  And there are eight, there are seven people here. I do have the corner though. I'm in the
[658.65s -> 664.97s]  best spot I think. I really believe that. This is an 11 hour Simpson stream incoming.
[664.97s -> 673.70s]  No. Oh fuck. All right, what do I got? I got five, I got 15,000. Let's do this right.
[673.70s -> 680.66s]  Look at this place. I've never seen this before. Like a little swamp. All right,
[680.66s -> 688.87s]  Citadel. Town Hall. We want to get this immediately. So, Town Hall will give us a
[688.87s -> 699.70s]  thousand gold day. We want to get it immediately. Prepare to backseat. Backseat gamers.
[700.87s -> 706.66s]  Let's get these gnolls and let's go out. Let's get it. Just look at it. I'm going
[706.66s -> 712.18s]  to play this as to the book as possible. If there was an encyclopedia on how to play this
[712.18s -> 723.50s]  game, I'm going to play it that way. I can't beat that guy. I'm just looking for a resource.
[725.48s -> 737.27s]  Lots of sprites. No. No resources right off the bat. There's a gate? Hold on, am I locked in my
[737.27s -> 754.79s]  own kingdom? Garrison. It's a garrison. Are you serious? I can leave people here?
[755.88s -> 762.94s]  This is unbelievably awesome. Wait, did I get a raid came in? Oh fuck, Jesus. I didn't even
[762.94s -> 771.64s]  see it. RT Gamecrowd came in with like a trillion people. Uh, thank you RT Gamecrowd
[772.60s -> 781.77s]  for the huge raid here. Welcome everybody. Hope you're having a good day. Hope your stream was
[781.77s -> 789.98s]  good. What were you playing? What was RT playing? And did they complete the game?
[790.62s -> 803.93s]  They're playing Nintendogs. How many dogs did he have? 50 dogs. All of them. Well, I hope
[803.93s -> 808.09s]  it was fun. Thank you so much for the raid. Welcome. A lot of you just came in. So,
[808.09s -> 812.98s]  we're playing. This is Heroes of Might and Magic and I'm going to win. I just started.
[812.98s -> 816.50s]  Get joined at a perfect fucking time. Let me tell you something. We've got the Burger King
[816.50s -> 824.39s]  Prince here. We've got our Gnolls here. I just started. I got a garrison here. What other things
[824.39s -> 827.27s]  can I point out that are just obvious if you're looking at the screen? I got a moat here.
[828.07s -> 832.65s]  Or a river. I've got a colon here. Got a colonoscopy here in a couple days.
[832.65s -> 838.92s]  That's what it's gonna look like. Let's go. But thanks again. Now he's doing- every time
[838.92s -> 845.64s]  a raid comes in, I gotta turn on like the YouTuber voice. Hey guys, welcome. Witch's Hut.
[845.64s -> 850.36s]  An ancient witch living in a strange hut welcomes you, teaching you pathfinding for her own
[850.36s -> 859.35s]  inscrutable purposes. That's actually really great. 25% less rough terrain penalty. I'll take
[859.35s -> 866.94s]  it. Of course I get a link to that. Do you guys just have that in a tab? How many of you
[866.94s -> 876.01s]  guys have that shit just in a tab waiting for like a reason to use it? Why have that just
[876.01s -> 881.66s]  ready to go in a tab? Lots of gargoyles. I can't beat them with these. All right,
[881.66s -> 888.92s]  swan pond. I need to see what's on the swan pond. But let's go back. We get gold a week here,
[890.95s -> 898.42s]  or every day. All right, we got the town hall. Citadel marketplace. I want a city hall.
[898.42s -> 903.82s]  So we need mage guild, marketplace, and a blacksmith. Of course we need the blacksmith.
[905.48s -> 913.40s]  So let's get that built. We're gonna go as fast as we can to get that 4,000 gold a day.
[913.40s -> 918.10s]  It's really important if you don't know what I'm talking about. When you get- when you
[918.10s -> 922.50s]  upgrade your city more than two or three times, you get to the maximum amount of
[922.50s -> 929.59s]  money. This is going to be the capital down here. You understand. All right, swan pond.
[930.23s -> 938.17s]  I got luck up. All right, don't be an idiot here. I don't want to be like a fucking idiot
[938.17s -> 943.51s]  here because the last time I spread the fuck out, mercenary camp. What's wrong with me?
[945.37s -> 959.35s]  That's all. I can only go that far. That's it. All right, well we need a marketplace
[959.99s -> 965.72s]  to get to the marketplace. While we have the wood, we're going to use it.
[966.36s -> 977.24s]  Okay, so should I go down or should I go up? Remember, there are seven other people here.
[977.24s -> 987.91s]  There are seven more fucking players. What do they- down? Up? I'm going to- the next
[987.91s -> 995.83s]  thing that somebody writes, I'm going to go down. Down, okay. Another colonoscopy here.
[998.01s -> 1009.80s]  Log. Can I touch it? Pack of Cerberi. I don't think I want to fuck with that.
[1010.68s -> 1018.97s]  Finally, we get some treasure. I forget, at the beginning of the game, you can't move. You
[1018.97s -> 1023.91s]  move so slowly. All right, we can probably- now we can do- we need mage guild, and then we're
[1023.91s -> 1027.59s]  going to do upgrade that hall. I wasn't doing this. Remember last time, I was like, let's
[1027.59s -> 1039.38s]  make like a hundred gnolls. I'm gonna have four heroes. Always go with experience first.
[1040.18s -> 1045.93s]  Let's get that level up here. That treasure chest had advanced pathfinding and basic
[1045.93s -> 1050.47s]  ballistics. So this is a brewmaster? What do they do? A beast? What do they do?
[1051.35s -> 1058.58s]  What do they do? Specialty is Ballista. It increases the attack and defense skill of any
[1058.58s -> 1062.26s]  ballista for each level attained after fourth level, so I think we have to do ballistics.
[1062.98s -> 1069.29s]  Basic armor reduces all damage inflicted against the hero's troops by five percent.
[1071.11s -> 1076.30s]  Basic artillery gives control of the ballista to the hero. That's pretty awesome.
[1081.22s -> 1089.86s]  Uh, wait, don't I already have this though? You know what I mean? I like already have
[1089.86s -> 1097.08s]  this. Basic artillery, but- okay, but that's- okay. Yeah, let's do it. Oh, it's a catapult
[1097.08s -> 1104.34s]  versus ballista. I get it. All right. Nice. I have one for ballista, now I have one for
[1104.34s -> 1109.13s]  catapult. I have one for- yeah, they're different. Wait a minute, what are you doing F for?
[1109.77s -> 1118.25s]  What are you talking about? This is good shit. This is good shit! What are you talking
[1118.25s -> 1133.70s]  about? Let's look up here. All right, we got a crossroads. We got lots of dwarves,
[1133.70s -> 1137.86s]  and then a war machine factory. I'm gonna- well, this is just wrapping back the other way. Okay,
[1137.86s -> 1142.98s]  let's go back to town. There's not a whole lot of resources back here. There's this. I gotta
[1142.98s -> 1152.12s]  stock up enough. Let's get that, uh, let's get the city hall built. Now we got 2,000 gold a day,
[1153.83s -> 1159.90s]  and I think we're gonna do another hero now. I need a tavern for that though. We'll do
[1159.90s -> 1176.23s]  tavern next. I'm the king of the mud. War machine factory. Uh, there's no- none available.
[1176.23s -> 1181.10s]  I can't just- I could get this right now. This is the first day, 10th. I mean, I should just get
[1181.10s -> 1192.31s]  them. But I already have it. Well, I'll get these then. Might as well just fill the party up.
[1198.23s -> 1202.47s]  Yeah, okay. That's awesome. Nice. Sick. Fucking unbelievable. I'm doing so good.
[1207.88s -> 1212.81s]  Tavern. Is there a tavern here? Oh, there is a tavern. All right. Well, now I'm- oh,
[1212.81s -> 1217.14s]  that's another beastmaster. I don't want to do necromancer again. I did it last time,
[1217.14s -> 1220.98s]  and it didn't- I'm gonna do auto. Waking up in the morning under the blankets.
[1221.94s -> 1239.32s]  I don't want phant again. Phant sucked. No, I'm doing auto. What, if I don't hire him,
[1239.32s -> 1244.38s]  he's gonna end up on the other team somewhere? What are the chances to get phant again?
[1246.15s -> 1249.27s]  Yeah, he sucks. And plus, he's gonna ruin my whole thing here.
[1249.99s -> 1259.14s]  No, can I pay him a hundred bucks to, like, never come back? I'm going with, uh,
[1259.14s -> 1264.50s]  I'm going with auto. Resurrect is good. No, I don't want him. He was bad luck charm last
[1264.50s -> 1272.89s]  time. My level four hero sucks at fighting level 17. My name- no, he was, like, level 19.
[1275.67s -> 1289.59s]  No, he's gone. You know, he's not leaving. He's like, can I please come? I'll sit here and as
[1289.59s -> 1301.77s]  long as it takes. All right, let's get you on a different path here. Two beastmas- specialty
[1301.77s -> 1315.27s]  wyverns. Nice. Basic scouting. Easy to see. One extra square. Cool. Okay. I wonder if we
[1315.27s -> 1322.92s]  could take on the sprites. Who's my other guy down here? Let's look here. Is it an observatory?
[1324.66s -> 1338.34s]  Oh, now we can see. Hey, you're already coming down here? How does this guy have this much?
[1338.34s -> 1353.74s]  It's the first- it's the first week. That's not possible. Lizard den. I gotta build some of
[1353.74s -> 1360.73s]  these. He- I- he went all in on troops. What is this glyph of fear? Resource silo. All
[1360.73s -> 1373.91s]  right, I'm gonna get the lizard den out. Let's get some lizards. And you come on out.
[1375.90s -> 1379.02s]  Actually, no, you know, you can stay there. I don't- I- he's not gonna come over here.
[1379.02s -> 1386.49s]  That's, like, rough terrain. This is, uh, lots of dwarves. I don't- what is this? It's
[1386.49s -> 1398.46s]  like a lumber mill. Water wheel. 500 gold. That's not that good. All right, let's, uh,
[1399.26s -> 1407.62s]  let's go the next week. See what happens. He's fucking coming down here. Why is everybody
[1407.62s -> 1420.60s]  coming down here? Pack, pack, pack, few, several. He's already here. They're already encroaching
[1420.60s -> 1433.99s]  on my swamp. Serpent fly. Basilisk pit. So I need- I need- what do I need? A couple of wood.
[1433.99s -> 1445.62s]  This is a marketplace. I need- I need- I need some wood. Let's go. I have lots of ore.
[1446.50s -> 1463.42s]  What do I need? Three? No, no, ten to one. Come on. Oh, this is bad. Well, I got 16, 14.
[1463.42s -> 1468.39s]  I could- I could go up here and maybe make a trade here. I gotta go up into the garrison
[1469.11s -> 1479.11s]  because I don't have any more troops. I don't- I can't even buy them. Lots of sprites. I wonder
[1479.11s -> 1484.38s]  if I can just kill this and take this all. There's so much wood over here. I'm gonna try
[1484.38s -> 1503.05s]  it. I can do this. Oh, this is- I see. Sprite- I did- sprites are, like, the easiest
[1503.05s -> 1512.92s]  things. I didn't- I didn't know they were that weak. Well, I say that. All right,
[1512.92s -> 1522.25s]  we'll get this wood and I'll be able to get some more troops. All right, good. I lost
[1522.25s -> 1529.59s]  some gnolls, but it's okay. Oh my god, there's so much over here. Claim this. Ah, I'm so far
[1529.59s -> 1534.55s]  away. I can't- Look at all this stuff. He- He's gonna come down here and he's gonna kill me,
[1535.19s -> 1547.64s]  isn't he? I- I've got to go down. I'm gonna wrap around this way. Damn. I only have 24 gnolls.
[1549.51s -> 1554.63s]  I'm gonna hit the mercenary camp and I'm probably gonna die. The- The- Sneak King is
[1554.63s -> 1561.48s]  gonna die, like, today. Hope you guys are aware of this. It's a new week coming up.
[1567.69s -> 1575.43s]  Citadel Captain's Quarters. That's good. How many Captain's Quarters? It's just money.
[1575.43s -> 1589.53s]  We can do Citadel. Citadel is growth for everybody. Okay, let's just hope he doesn't
[1589.53s -> 1593.05s]  do anything. He's gonna- We're gonna fight and I'm gonna die. Say goodbye to the Sneak King.
[1593.86s -> 1609.99s]  No, he's just- Already has all this shit. I think I just lost. So it turns out being
[1609.99s -> 1620.62s]  down in the swamp was not good. Um, I- Not yet. What is the biggest threat here? 13 to 10. He
[1620.62s -> 1629.18s]  just has- No, it's- I- I lose. He actually bought units. Well, because last time when I did that,
[1629.18s -> 1635.54s]  it- It snowballed me into not being able to do anything. I tried to, like, upgrade the
[1635.54s -> 1640.10s]  capital first because I figured with a huge map, I wasn't gonna get attacked in the first
[1640.10s -> 1668.02s]  month. It's not over yet. 10, 20. Oh, it's definitely over. Ah, I wish I had anything.
[1672.57s -> 1684.74s]  End of the- End of the mudshire. I mean, hold on. Hold on, though. It's not over yet.
[1695.96s -> 1704.87s]  Come on! It's not over yet. It's not over yet. No. Holy shit, I might actually win. No,
[1704.87s -> 1724.38s]  I won't. No, there's too many. I forgot about this guy. Well, I tried just making
[1724.38s -> 1730.30s]  a bunch of monsters last time, and I- And nobody attacked me for six months. And then I went- Let
[1730.30s -> 1733.98s]  me try to get, like, money first. Let me, like, tech first. No, I'm attacked in the first, like,
[1733.98s -> 1746.33s]  two weeks. He's gonna take all this stuff. Oh my fucking god. He didn't get it all.
[1746.89s -> 1759.06s]  Come on, a second. I might really get revenge here. Where the hell am I going?
[1759.70s -> 1775.82s]  I can't afford it. Buy a hero- Yeah, buy a hero, stack with units, then send out.
[1775.82s -> 1780.36s]  That's what I did last time. It's not over yet. I'm- No, it's not over yet. Not yet.
[1785.86s -> 1799.93s]  Witch or cleric? Probably witch. I can get my revenge here.
[1804.54s -> 1819.22s]  Okay, it's not over. 35, 13, 4. I got him up here. He's got 24. There's nobody in this garrison.
[1822.17s -> 1830.71s]  He's gonna get this materials up down here. Yeah, I made it, okay. Now the question is,
[1830.71s -> 1839.59s]  can I get far enough where I can meet you up here? Oh, am I one fucking pixel away?
[1841.37s -> 1859.08s]  Come on. I can do it. Oh, no! Attack him? No, I can't. Not yet. I want those gnolls.
[1859.64s -> 1869.98s]  He took everything. Oh, it was a bad fucking start. Because he still has the-
[1882.20s -> 1889.58s]  All right, fucking get rid of him. Because he still has this shit. Like,
[1889.58s -> 1893.94s]  the- these guys- he has, like, more than I do. All right, it's time to win.
[1894.90s -> 1914.68s]  Magic arrow. We're gonna deal with you. Fly over here. He took all that stuff. Like,
[1914.68s -> 1921.53s]  what are you even doing down here? This is like- this map is huge. Last night,
[1921.53s -> 1926.86s]  we didn't see a monster. We didn't see another person for two to three straight months.
[1930.10s -> 1936.86s]  Bullshit. What's going on? Why am I- Oh, what? Okay, I can control them because of the-
[1936.86s -> 1952.26s]  I get it, right. I kind of have to go back. It's because it was water. All right,
[1952.26s -> 1965.45s]  that makes sense. I can't shoot anybody. You really don't like that tent, do you?
[1974.97s -> 1995.88s]  Bug on bug action. Is that an oof? All right, gnolls are gonna be so heavy this game. It's
[1995.88s -> 2000.78s]  not over yet. I just got kind of, like, fucked over in the beginning. It's okay. Don't
[2000.78s -> 2015.14s]  worry. We're gonna be fine. I'll get really good experience by doing this.
[2015.14s -> 2054.15s]  All the experience he just stole from me? I'm about to get it right back. Don't let
[2054.15s -> 2065.03s]  him run. I'm trying to get the gnoll up there. There he goes, dead. No running for you,
[2065.03s -> 2073.51s]  900 experience. All right, now I get the wood and I get the learning stone. Okay.
[2076.42s -> 2080.50s]  I- God damn it. I can't believe he came in immediately and just took all my shit.
[2080.50s -> 2088.87s]  I'm so irritated about that. Allows your hero to learn fourth level spells or eagle eye.
[2094.76s -> 2104.94s]  I'm so fucking, like, irritated. I wonder if it should be- probably wisdom. Give me this
[2104.94s -> 2109.82s]  back. One of you take it. All right, now everything's okay again. There is another
[2109.82s -> 2116.73s]  person that's over here. There is- okay, what do you got? We got lots of skeleton warriors.
[2117.61s -> 2126.04s]  There's a lot of stuff up there. Lou, what do you got? Oh, you got nothing. See,
[2126.04s -> 2130.52s]  like, why could I be over here where he is? He's got a pack of, like, rats and that's
[2130.52s -> 2135.82s]  it. Of course, the one dickhead that stacked minions, like, ran straight down.
[2139.02s -> 2146.60s]  All right, uh, let's go back to the castle. I got zero idea. Okay.
[2148.47s -> 2154.07s]  Uh, glyphs of fear, captain's quarters. Might as well just make it just because
[2155.40s -> 2161.69s]  get those extra gnolls and then next week I'm gonna get the fly den. What does it cost?
[2164.76s -> 2174.09s]  Serpent fly. I need five wood. I have the rest. I gotta work on wood. All right,
[2174.09s -> 2177.77s]  you don't have anybody. You gotta go back here and we're gonna claim this, too.
[2178.33s -> 2190.01s]  Lots of halberds. They're hard, though. Where are you right now? See, like, he has, like, a pack
[2190.65s -> 2197.58s]  several. Where's he going? Down the sanctuary? Okay, well, that's all done. I got that
[2197.58s -> 2209.10s]  claimed. You go in here. Okay, I can't do any of this. I need that wood. I'm gonna get,
[2209.10s -> 2222.63s]  what, one a day? Two a day? Don't have enough to do anything. I need 50 and 12. I
[2222.63s -> 2227.75s]  think I can go out with her. 50 gnolls is a lot of gnolls. I should be okay. In fact,
[2228.63s -> 2250.34s]  I wonder if the gnolls can take on the halberds. Holy shit, this nine, those nine wood. He missed
[2250.34s -> 2257.67s]  it. I thought he got everything. Oh, wow. Thank heavens. Serpent fly hive. And I should
[2257.67s -> 2261.83s]  do the gnoll hut. Upgrade the gnoll hut and get super gnolls. No, what do I do? Super,
[2261.83s -> 2271.66s]  no. I think I'm just going straight up with extra super gnolls and then I'm gonna transfer
[2271.66s -> 2293.90s]  them into super gnolls and then go up. All right, come back here. Oh my goodness. Everybody's
[2293.90s -> 2299.34s]  like all over the place now. I want these 50 gnolls to be super gnolls. Out of the way.
[2306.20s -> 2312.34s]  Bingo. Gnoll Marauders. What's the difference to you? Three, five, two to three, six.
[2313.14s -> 2318.98s]  Two to three, six, five. Two to three, six, four. A higher defense, higher attack skill. Yeah,
[2318.98s -> 2331.05s]  they're just better. Now, better lizards? What do you think? Should I just go straight up
[2331.05s -> 2343.94s]  better lizards? I wonder if I should do that right now. Yep. This is, this is good now. This
[2343.94s -> 2352.71s]  is really good. Lizard warriors, lizard men. Two to three. Okay, hold on. Five, six. They do
[2352.71s -> 2361.19s]  12 shots. Six, eight, 24, two to five, 15, 14. Better speed. All right. Looking good so far.
[2365.69s -> 2370.41s]  I think it's time to just, I'm gonna, I think I can take these, uh, Halliburters.
[2374.36s -> 2379.46s]  Maybe I should wait till next week and get a fully upgraded because you're,
[2379.46s -> 2388.89s]  he's just not doing shit in here, is he? I'm thinking of just waiting to next week,
[2388.89s -> 2403.64s]  get a good pack and then bring it up. The plan doesn't change here. You know what I mean?
[2403.64s -> 2410.98s]  I don't think I should change the plan. So capital needs castle. So I need 10 wood.
[2411.93s -> 2415.37s]  I need serpents. So I need five wood before the end of this week.
[2420.42s -> 2424.90s]  All right. Do you think, should I go after the Halliburters with my 50 gnolls and 12,
[2425.14s -> 2437.51s]  lizard warriors? Wait, just in case something fucking really bad happens.
[2440.66s -> 2456.47s]  I just, that just gets this shit out of me. Conquerors. I got this. It's gonna take me
[2456.47s -> 2468.71s]  forever to get here. Let's do haste. Bloodlust. Bloodlust on, uh, I think I'm gonna think
[2468.71s -> 2487.94s]  bloodlust on you. Bang. Nice. I don't want, nobody die. Nobody die. Three dead. You gotta
[2487.94s -> 2496.28s]  go twice. All right. Yes. And I get this right here too. Oh, I'm so fucking happy.
[2497.34s -> 2501.74s]  Knowledge plus one level three. Advanced first aid gives control of the first eight,
[2501.74s -> 2505.42s]  10 to the hero, healing 75 points of damage to the first unit of the selected stack
[2506.50s -> 2519.91s]  or basic water magic. 75 points of damage. I feel like I would want the water, but
[2520.71s -> 2531.51s]  that's it. 75 health is a lot. Look at all this. Nine ore, five ore, five ore.
[2532.47s -> 2539.16s]  There's so much over here. Beautiful. All right, I got another couple days before.
[2540.04s -> 2548.06s]  I need, uh, let's go in here. I need, what the fuck do I need? Five wood. What do I have now?
[2548.06s -> 2562.62s]  Two. Got a couple days left. All right, let's grab that. Six. Claim this. I couldn't touch it.
[2563.98s -> 2567.26s]  All that wood gone, but it did help a lot. Okay, so now I've got two a day over here
[2567.26s -> 2573.77s]  and it's all the way down in my swamp. Seems pretty good. All right, we're almost there. I
[2573.77s -> 2586.17s]  need one more wood, which will, I can get it tomorrow. That will bring me to serpents. Oh,
[2587.91s -> 2603.29s]  I should get this. One wooden one ore a day. That's amazing. Cage of warlords.
[2605.93s -> 2611.91s]  Shipyard. I can buy boats from here. All right, let's get that serpent flyhive next
[2612.63s -> 2615.19s]  and then I'll show, I have a good army and I'm going to go take them out.
[2615.19s -> 2619.88s]  One of my thoughts in the game so far is game is phenomenal. It's absolutely fantastic.
[2619.88s -> 2626.28s]  Okay, so let's bring you back. It's almost time for a new week.
[2640.57s -> 2652.33s]  Flyhive. Get it. I am now, I'm now available. Hold on. What about tomorrow? Growth is in coming
[2652.33s -> 2664.39s]  tomorrow. Flyhive. I can't do it. I can do it tomorrow. I can do superflies tomorrow. Next,
[2664.39s -> 2670.23s]  it's first week. Second week. Here we go. Superflies. Get it all. I'm going for it. Watch
[2670.23s -> 2684.65s]  this. And then this, this hero is going out. You leave for a moment. Do I have to back up?
[2684.65s -> 2695.14s]  Can we not both fit on the road? Oh, this is going to be awesome. All right, here we go.
[2695.14s -> 2704.81s]  Ready? I am ready to take a large army up. Upgrade the, or should I get basilisks right
[2704.81s -> 2724.06s]  now? Which one? Basilisks or better flies? Basilisks may be this strong. Am I not going
[2724.06s -> 2737.16s]  to have enough money to do this all? I don't know what to do. I'm going to go with the flies
[2737.80s -> 2752.86s]  because now they're superflies and I can get 20 of these. I don't have enough money. I can wait.
[2754.22s -> 2757.10s]  We'll do it tomorrow. I need to get money. Go get money. You just go buy stuff.
[2758.41s -> 2771.46s]  Who cares if this guy dies? Who cares? Scout, get out here. Go adventure. Go claim
[2771.46s -> 2784.42s]  something. You're giving me fucking diarrhea. Like go claim this. Oh, I could kill this guy.
[2784.42s -> 2804.20s]  I could kill this guy right now. Get this tomorrow. How are we doing? More. This is damn
[2804.20s -> 2809.67s]  good army. All right. I'm going to, I think I'm going to go with this. What do you think?
[2809.67s -> 2814.10s]  This is, this is a damn good army. 43, 12. This is damn good. I could kill this guy.
[2819.51s -> 2823.98s]  One more day and that's it. Last day. That's it. That's it. No more. No more.
[2823.98s -> 2826.70s]  I don't care what happens. Oh fuck. He's going to kill me. No, he's not. I'm going
[2826.70s -> 2845.77s]  to kill him right now. Right into my trap. Okay. Come on. Come on. What do I need? I could
[2845.77s -> 2853.34s]  do. Oh, God damn it. All right. I'm going up. I'm going up. I'm going up. I'm going up. I have a lot.
[2854.06s -> 2866.81s]  I can get rid of orange right now. I'm going in here. He's blocking the gate. He's going to
[2866.81s -> 2872.41s]  die, but it's okay. Look at this crew. This is a really good first month, second month crew.
[2874.12s -> 2877.16s]  He's scared. He ain't fucking going to handle this. I'm going to kill him. He's dead.
[2877.88s -> 2900.22s]  Let's start clearing shit. You can take the next stack of people. Where am I? Oh,
[2900.22s -> 2905.78s]  right here. All right. We're going this way. I've got a lot of good troops.
[2906.42s -> 2912.60s]  I'm going to head out towards the witch's hut here. I got basic pathfinding. Good
[2913.64s -> 2922.62s]  mercenary camp plus one attack. You're in big trouble and then I'm going to claim
[2923.42s -> 2928.31s]  this. We'll get the we'll get through this and I'm going to go down. I'm going to
[2928.31s -> 2935.54s]  grab this. There's a harpy loft over there. I've got a plan. I think it's a decent plan.
[2936.10s -> 2943.61s]  Let me get the basilisk thing opened and upgraded. Basilisk pit. Make it. There it is.
[2944.25s -> 2949.94s]  Four basilisks are available. We let them hang out. We don't have to do anything about this.
[2949.94s -> 2965.37s]  This is your team. Now you die. What about the dwarves? What is it? Lots of dwarves.
[2966.17s -> 2980.70s]  I can handle it. I want this sulfur pit. Oh yes. I did. Sometimes you just have to go
[2980.70s -> 2990.09s]  for it because they don't want to fight you. 35 dwarves. Now you actually are dead. You
[2990.09s -> 2995.94s]  can't be scared. Sometimes you just got to go for it. You ain't going to get out of here.
[2995.94s -> 3003.46s]  Head in here. Let's get you in the building. Get you some troops just in case something bad
[3003.46s -> 3008.71s]  happens. We've got four baskets on you now. What else can I buy here? Nothing. I've got no
[3008.71s -> 3022.42s]  money. Here we go. Really? Really? Time to die. In fact, I can just bring the serpent
[3022.42s -> 3035.98s]  straight in and just murder you. Let's go bloodlust on the serpents. The serpents are going right
[3035.98s -> 3054.26s]  for the jesters. Infecting everybody. I love it. Okay, let's move. You got to start moving
[3054.26s -> 3061.50s]  down here. I wonder who's my more priority. Probably the gargoyles because they can move
[3061.50s -> 3085.69s]  really fast. Get those dwarves up there. All right. Gargoyles. Dead. Let's go for the
[3085.69s -> 3092.14s]  golems. They're the most dangerous. Fine. Bring it up to the nose. That was a mistake. You
[3092.14s -> 3099.61s]  shouldn't have done that. He's gone. I didn't lose very much and I got a bunch of experience
[3099.61s -> 3113.53s]  and he's out of here. Let's claim this all. Back to the building. How are we doing? Okay.
[3113.53s -> 3120.31s]  Got more. What do we want to build? Glyphs of fear plus two to a garrison's hero defense
[3120.31s -> 3125.03s]  when defending. I can upgrade the pit next. I just need money. We're going to get the glyph
[3126.14s -> 3143.82s]  just to get it. All right. Here comes somebody else. Who is that? That is blue.
[3145.02s -> 3149.74s]  Several pack, few. You're dead. Oh, this feels good to be powerful. It feels good to have like
[3149.74s -> 3155.06s]  power. Lots of stone golems. I mean, we're going to meet you halfway here. You're in
[3155.06s -> 3166.70s]  trouble. Get out of my territory. I told you it wasn't over. No, it's not over. Restart,
[3166.70s -> 3174.90s]  restart. No, no. You got to push through sometimes. Blood obelisk. Cage of warlords.
[3176.22s -> 3189.29s]  Upgrade basilisk pit. Now we have greater basilisks. Six to ten and five. Six to ten
[3189.29s -> 3199.61s]  forty. And they're faster. Now the pit has eyes. Yeah, that's fucking weird.
[3201.98s -> 3211.45s]  Okay. Continue. Where are you going? You're going all the way down here. What are you
[3211.45s -> 3221.58s]  doing, man? Are you just like, are you just asking to die? All dwellings increase population.
[3222.30s -> 3224.46s]  I don't think I even need, I don't think I even have to go down there.
[3231.40s -> 3240.94s]  I'm coming out because guess what? I got nine basilisks and he's not going to take this.
[3247.05s -> 3250.49s]  Maybe I should just follow him down here. Yeah, let's, I'm, no, you're not taking
[3250.49s -> 3267.30s]  this all from me. Well, now you trapped yourself, but I'll take it back and I'm
[3267.30s -> 3282.74s]  going to block the road. Good luck. Pink is dead. Pink has been vanquished. There are seven who
[3282.74s -> 3298.94s]  remain. Same deal. Bloodlust on, bloodlust on the archers. And then we got here. Anybody,
[3298.94s -> 3307.74s]  I don't think Hayden has any ranged. I think I should probably go for the wolf riders.
[3308.30s -> 3326.34s]  Now bloodlust is melee. Fuck. It's only melee. Damn it. I'm going in for wolf riders. I'm
[3326.34s -> 3338.52s]  going to feel like killing in one hit. Yeah. I mean, you just, you don't stand any chance.
[3339.56s -> 3353.50s]  Why would you throw it at him? Yeah. You're more of an immediate threat.
[3356.22s -> 3364.49s]  Enemy ran away out of my territory and look where we are down here and I can go down here
[3364.49s -> 3372.71s]  and I can stock up again. I'm going to be fucking pretty damn unstoppable. Look at this.
[3377.98s -> 3395.86s]  Mm hmm. Pull him out. Actually, I can just trade them. So, hey, come here. You're going to have
[3395.86s -> 3402.10s]  13 more of these, 12 more of these, 33 more of these. And actually I'll give you one dwarf.
[3402.10s -> 3418.18s]  How does that sound? All right. Back in here. You and the one dwarf. Now that's an army.
[3418.18s -> 3425.82s]  Oh yeah. Give me the other stuff too. Give me like, give me like literally just,
[3425.82s -> 3432.54s]  I'm just going to strip you. Give me, uh, give me this shit. Give me this,
[3433.50s -> 3449.67s]  give me this. I already have one of those. You have any artifacts? Get back in here.
[3450.39s -> 3459.05s]  Good. Now it's time to go up and I now have basilisks. Good to go. This is a huge army.
[3460.01s -> 3465.80s]  Now I get to go wherever I please. I've already got this claimed. I'm going to go right.
[3465.80s -> 3469.40s]  Nobody is over here. Now I'm going to go down. I'm going to go down and go up. Let's
[3469.40s -> 3485.34s]  get rid of these gargoyles. Move on from here. Don't pursue. Let him run.
[3485.74s -> 3501.43s]  Sulfur. Plus two luck. And pond. A pack of Cerberi. Now that might not be something I want to do.
[3502.07s -> 3523.58s]  I wonder if it's something I should try. Don't engage. Now this is a harpy loft.
[3525.82s -> 3537.02s]  Yep. I just have more units. It's time to begin conquering. Wait, let's get back to the
[3537.02s -> 3542.79s]  castle. Let's get some more of these units just in case something fucking bad happens.
[3544.50s -> 3555.14s]  Lud obelisk, cage of warlords, wyvern nest, gorgon lair. Let's do gorgon lair. We'll get the growth,
[3555.14s -> 3562.41s]  double growth from gorgons. And remember, we're just, we're stashing here with this guy.
[3563.13s -> 3573.62s]  Until I get another castle, I am stashing. New week. All populations have doubled. Now
[3573.62s -> 3577.78s]  you're over here. What are you looking at? There's a blue over here somewhere.
[3578.50s -> 3582.82s]  Where's that blue guy? Right here? Okay, you really, what do you got?
[3584.26s -> 3590.90s]  Pack. You. Lots. Bored. Lots. Pretty dangerous. But I'll be okay.
[3591.70s -> 3598.26s]  Let's head up this way. Make sure to go down. Let's go through the stone golems.
[3599.94s -> 3608.07s]  Don't pursue. Let him run. Cliff nest. The cliff nest is guarded by several rocks. Do you
[3608.07s -> 3617.37s]  wish to fight the guards? Rocks. Is it, am I gonna get griffins? All right, this is,
[3617.37s -> 3632.18s]  all right, hold on here. Um, magic arrow. Haste. Bloodlust on, bloodlust on the dragonflies.
[3637.24s -> 3646.09s]  Just get him in. Or haste on the dragonflies. Wait for him to come to you. Um, I think he
[3646.09s -> 3650.36s]  can make it across the whole thing, can he? Or haste on the archers. That's not a bad idea.
[3653.21s -> 3666.63s]  Haste on archers. So maybe I should just wait, because I think he can fly all the way
[3666.63s -> 3685.69s]  across. Yeah, I'll wait. I'm gonna put the basilisks. They have 60 health each.
[3686.65s -> 3701.40s]  I'm putting basilisk in front of archers. Block archers. Get the dwarves in front of
[3701.40s -> 3707.61s]  the archers. Just make it try to get, no, no, don't, don't do that much. Should I just
[3707.61s -> 3716.25s]  put every hex? Here we go, look at this. Here he comes! All right, he still has to come to us.
[3717.13s -> 3724.38s]  Uh, haste the archers again, but bloodlust, I'm bloodlust on the, uh, on the gargoyles.
[3725.10s -> 3733.22s]  And then I'm going in. Wait, don't haste the archers. Increase the speed of the selected
[3733.22s -> 3736.34s]  unit. Everybody, people were telling me that was a good idea. Was that not a good idea?
[3736.90s -> 3740.74s]  Haste is just movement. Oh, was I getting baited? Everyone was like, haste the archers,
[3740.74s -> 3746.47s]  haste the archers. Speed is just movement time. Then I thought maybe it was turns as
[3746.55s -> 3760.58s]  well. All right, I'm going to bloodlust on the basilisk. And where, we're going in. Get in there.
[3767.62s -> 3778.78s]  Over the gnolls. Basilisk, bloodlust. Bang. He's only got one more. One more hit. Nice. I lost
[3778.78s -> 3790.55s]  it a little bit, but not, that was, that was. Okay, here we go. Expert first aid. A hundred
[3790.55s -> 3796.73s]  points of damage to the first unit of the selected stack. Or should I get earth magic?
[3798.65s -> 3804.31s]  Yeah, first aid, unless you have, here's how first aid is good. Because remember, it's to the first
[3804.31s -> 3809.70s]  unit of the stack. So if you have, let's say, for instance, like a dragon or something,
[3809.70s -> 3816.54s]  something that has more than a hundred health, you know, if a dragon has 150 health, then
[3817.18s -> 3820.78s]  right, you just do that. But I don't have anything like that yet. Let's do earth magic.
[3826.60s -> 3836.30s]  This is a pretty stacked party right now. It just is. So, I mean, I could meet you here.
[3840.18s -> 3848.95s]  This would be a fight, but he wouldn't take the castle. I'd probably win. Where do I go down?
[3848.95s -> 3857.26s]  I don't have, I used all that money. I don't have any more money to do this.
[3858.22s -> 3872.39s]  I can't really do it yet. I wonder, I don't know if he's gonna come down. Okay, if he
[3872.39s -> 3881.51s]  comes down here, then I start to change my strategy. Because I don't think he even knows
[3881.51s -> 3891.38s]  this exists down here. Should I pull back and go on defense? Well, we'll have to find out.
[3891.38s -> 3895.72s]  We'll see what he does this week. There he goes. Okay. He's not coming down here.
[3896.44s -> 3914.33s]  Up or down? I'm gonna say down. Nothing in here. Okay. Let's take it slow here.
[3918.39s -> 3933.26s]  How do I get in there? I think I can get in there from here. Look at this down here.
[3933.26s -> 3942.14s]  There's like a little slot down there. Go back. Let's check on, I'm just gonna,
[3942.14s -> 3944.86s]  I'm building, you know, I'm just gonna build, upgrade the Gorgon lair.
[3945.50s -> 3950.46s]  And then now look at this. I can get upgraded Gorgons. What do they turn into?
[3951.34s -> 3962.97s]  Are they throwing up? Why is he puking? Why is he just throwing up? 10, 14, 12 to 16,
[3962.97s -> 3971.35s]  12 to 16. Same damage, same health, but higher defense and a little bit faster.
[3971.35s -> 3984.76s]  Can move further. When I get the money, I felt like somebody was just going to just drive into
[3984.76s -> 3988.44s]  the house. Like I really felt like somebody was going into the window. Like I thought
[3988.44s -> 3992.76s]  that was somebody in a little drone flying and crashing into my window. That just scared
[3992.76s -> 4002.86s]  the shit out of me. That was in the house. Yeah. That sounded fake. Somebody's in a pod racer out
[4002.86s -> 4011.59s]  here. That was a Star Wars fucking pod racer. That wasn't even a car. Yeah, it really was.
[4017.42s -> 4019.82s]  Just waiting for the guy to yell out outside his fucking car.
[4024.39s -> 4048.55s]  Oh no. All right. Stick to the plan. I'm going back this way. I need to get this
[4048.55s -> 4052.63s]  so much treasure under there. I'm taking a risk and see if it pays off. Any more of these? Let's
[4052.63s -> 4057.14s]  check. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me just get this. Are there any more in here?
[4058.10s -> 4066.47s]  No, I didn't know if it maybe this. I don't know. Go down. Come on. Come on. Make this
[4066.47s -> 4070.15s]  worth it. Make it worth it. The hat. It's got to be like a little path down here. Make
[4070.15s -> 4074.63s]  it worth it. Please. There is, but there's like fucking magma elementals. I don't think
[4074.63s -> 4077.51s]  I can go through here. Should I do this? There's a lot of treasure over here.
[4080.89s -> 4097.53s]  Somebody's coming. Pack lots, few, several, several. This'll be a fight. But what if they,
[4106.25s -> 4124.15s]  but what if they're, they want to join us? Um, okay. But, but what do I do? I have too
[4124.15s -> 4132.76s]  many people. Harpies? Harpies are out of here. Trade Harpies for magma elementals.
[4132.76s -> 4152.74s]  I spent like a thousand bucks on these though. Six to ten. Holy fuck. Oh yeah.
[4153.30s -> 4157.29s]  What about the Dwarves? The Dwarves are kind of terrible though. They haven't done anything.
[4157.29s -> 4163.13s]  They just stood around. They just watched the fight. Six. So seven and eight. Six and five.
[4163.69s -> 4170.62s]  Now they're better. Yeah, there's a lot of them. Yeah. Okay. That's it. That's,
[4170.62s -> 4177.29s]  holy shit, man. Sometimes you got to go for it. And now I got a ton of stuff down here. 500
[4177.29s -> 4184.34s]  gold. I'm thinking I buy, I'm, I'm thinking to take the money because then I can buy every
[4184.34s -> 4196.30s]  unit. Someone's coming down here. It's always experience. Yeah. Level five. Expert. Wisdom.
[4196.30s -> 4204.39s]  Basic navigation. Chris, you're here as movement points at C by 50% or fifth level spells. But I
[4204.39s -> 4213.26s]  don't have a mage tower. And then we get to go this way. Look at this little fucking secret.
[4213.82s -> 4223.82s]  I'm gonna head back here. Upgrade these guys. How much can I pull out? A pretty substantial
[4223.82s -> 4237.38s]  amount of people. There's still one dwarf here. I mean, this is a decent army. What the hell is
[4237.38s -> 4253.53s]  that? I tried to click it. He's taking my shit. Dragon wing tavern. This item increases
[4253.53s -> 4258.84s]  your knowledge and power skills by plus two. This guy scares me. He's coming. He's wrapping
[4258.84s -> 4264.68s]  around. It might be time to, but I want to go over here and see what I want to get all
[4264.68s -> 4273.66s]  this stuff. Look at all this stuff. I can go back and just stack and have so many.
[4275.02s -> 4277.34s]  Should I, but, but he's gonna come down here and take all this stuff.
[4278.14s -> 4292.74s]  The stuff's not gonna go anywhere. But I have to go all the way around. He's gonna get there
[4292.74s -> 4306.07s]  before I do. Lots of griffins blocking the way here. I'm going for greed. I'm going for
[4306.07s -> 4323.74s]  greed. I am. I'm sorry, guys. I got plenty of growth. Holy shit. Pack of dragonflies.
[4324.68s -> 4327.80s]  You want to join me? I'll let you. You can join me if you want.
[4330.38s -> 4332.46s]  Odd by the power of your forces begin to scatter.
[4350.14s -> 4364.62s]  Water elemental conflux? Uh, oh, these things are so good, but I don't have enough room.
[4365.42s -> 4376.15s]  Look at all this. It's so wonderful. This is so much. Lots of, okay, this royal griffins
[4376.15s -> 4384.12s]  guarding. This like mini boss and then actual boss. So I gotta be careful down here.
[4387.10s -> 4396.42s]  Delete the dwarves. Delete the dwarves. Just get another hero. All right, I'm gonna get another
[4396.42s -> 4402.30s]  hero and I'm gonna walk up over here. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm getting a
[4402.30s -> 4408.54s]  little overwhelmed. I'm not gonna lie. I'm getting kind of overwhelmed. Um, what, hold on. I need
[4408.54s -> 4419.54s]  a capital. I need a castle. I need 5,000 gold. Let me just get to, hold on. I'm overwhelming
[4419.54s -> 4426.71s]  myself. I need the money. I need the, I'm so, look at how much I have. 100 fucking ore,
[4426.71s -> 4430.31s]  30. I'm so stacked on resources this game, but I don't have any money.
[4430.31s -> 4442.15s]  Let me just fill it up. All right, he's not coming this way. He's not coming this way.
[4442.71s -> 4446.81s]  Oh, look at all this stuff. Always experience or should I take the money?
[4447.53s -> 4477.00s]  Free. XP is priceless. I know it is. Money. Money for the army. I'm getting greedy.
[4480.02s -> 4489.58s]  Basic sorcery. Expert first aid. Level six. And there's all this up here. I wonder if I can
[4489.58s -> 4498.79s]  take some of this. Five percent more damage. I'll take it. Nothing else this way. I got
[4498.79s -> 4511.37s]  mercenary camp plus one attack. Head back here. What do we got? Castle. I need 5,000 gold.
[4513.94s -> 4520.10s]  Get plenty of units stacked up. I'm gonna save. I'm not gonna spend any money.
[4520.82s -> 4529.37s]  We're good. Now here's the thing. A pack of pit lords. I can definitely take them.
[4530.09s -> 4544.09s]  There's only a pack and it's a fucking gold mine behind them. They're dangerous. They have a lot
[4544.09s -> 4557.88s]  of health. They have a lot of damage. They do not have any ranged. I'm thinking just magic
[4557.88s -> 4568.22s]  arrow. Protection from fire. That makes no... I think I'm just gonna have to zap.
[4568.94s -> 4576.94s]  Okay. Don't go anywhere. They're probably slow. What's their speed? Seven. They can go far.
[4577.66s -> 4582.41s]  I think they can fly. Just hold back. Hold back. I just want to say I need to see.
[4583.37s -> 4589.78s]  I've got my own like shitty version of them. I have my like bargain bin knockoff version
[4589.78s -> 4618.36s]  of these guys. Nobody move. Nobody do anything stupid. Send the dwarves in. Fuck them. They
[4618.36s -> 4632.01s]  got whips. All right. Now I've got an opportunity to dwarf. Bloodlust the dwarves or just zap them.
[4632.01s -> 4638.30s]  Just get rid of the stack up here. I think I'm gonna zap and just continue to fight.
[4639.02s -> 4647.53s]  Give the dwarves haste. Now zap. Let's take it down four. That's perfect. All right. I think
[4647.53s -> 4655.70s]  it's time to go in. No. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Don't go in. Not you. No. He can
[4655.70s -> 4660.52s]  make it. I didn't think he could make it all the way. All right. We gotta... It's time to go.
[4663.67s -> 4680.50s]  Kill him. Dead. Stay here. What the fuck did he just do? Why is he... What did he turn into?
[4688.20s -> 4698.04s]  He turned into like a... He re-transformed or something? All right. Dwarves. I can't get up
[4698.04s -> 4702.84s]  there. They're gonna have... They'll kill it eventually. What does it do? Can I see the
[4702.84s -> 4712.09s]  stats? It's just a kind of a shittier version. That's okay. Summon demons from dead ally.
[4712.09s -> 4721.32s]  But... Oh, he's doing it. So he's casting it on that dead body. Okay. So he needs to die.
[4722.68s -> 4752.49s]  Like now. Send in the fucking dwarves. Fast lift to get in. If I kill this, will he revive it?
[4753.05s -> 4767.69s]  Or can he only... How many times can he do that? Good. Okay. I'm gonna give bloodlust
[4767.69s -> 4776.63s]  to the dwarves. They're gonna show their worth. Keep the... Actually, he's blocked it right
[4776.63s -> 4785.02s]  now. I'm not gonna stay where I am. Everybody else is gonna have to move. It's gonna... You
[4785.02s -> 4798.20s]  have to do the bath list. You just have to kill. Go on, dwarves. Nice. Surround him. Nice.
[4802.12s -> 4808.52s]  One more. You got to go twice. Kill him. Thousand experience. I had some blouses,
[4808.52s -> 4816.95s]  but it's okay. We have a gold mine now. This is a thousand gold a day. And I get
[4816.95s -> 4827.70s]  plus one attack. It was a little sloppy, but it's all right. Now I wonder. A lot of centaur
[4827.70s -> 4836.26s]  captains. I probably can get in. I can probably do this too. We can replace the gnolls with the
[4836.26s -> 4848.30s]  elementals. Either that or we stack. Okay. Let's do what I was gonna do. Castle
[4849.02s -> 4866.14s]  and then capital. Capital's next. Maybe I should... I think it's time to maybe head back
[4866.78s -> 4870.14s]  because I don't know if it's gonna be possible for me to do this.
[4873.43s -> 4881.21s]  Lots of captains and lots of griffins, but I mean... Can I get that wood here? I don't
[4881.21s -> 4893.48s]  think I can get through this. I'm not sure. The royal griffin. Lots of royal griffins.
[4894.28s -> 4901.27s]  I mean, this could just be like... I got plenty of stuff. Hold on. We're gonna just do this.
[4902.15s -> 4914.25s]  I'm gonna trade the gnolls for the elementals because, I mean,
[4914.25s -> 4923.62s]  they're not doing anything for me right now. What's worse? 27 dwarves or 15 gnolls?
[4924.86s -> 4931.51s]  6-7 defense. 8-8. 2-4. 2-3. 20 health. No, these things suck.
[4934.66s -> 4947.67s]  Yeah. We're gonna replace. We're gonna get six water elementals. 3-7. These things aren't that
[4947.67s -> 4952.42s]  much better though. They actually aren't very good. It's not worth 1,800 bucks.
[4954.17s -> 4962.58s]  No, it's not worth it. It's not worth it. I can stack the gnolls. Yeah, that's true.
[4967.35s -> 4972.38s]  I saved it right before that, right? Like, I saved it literally right before making that
[4972.38s -> 4979.88s]  turn, right? Because that's a waste of a turn. I did, right? Yeah. I mean, that was just a waste.
[4987.14s -> 4992.09s]  Okay. Here we go. I already got the plus attack. Let's see if I can get through here.
[4992.89s -> 5001.05s]  Do not engage. Yes! I get the two wood a day. Should I go for the... Look at this. Should I
[5001.05s -> 5021.75s]  go for it? Should I go for it? I'm going for it. Oh, man. 14. They're not scary at all.
[5021.75s -> 5025.99s]  I thought they... Royal Griffins. All right. I thought they were going to be insane.
[5026.87s -> 5037.42s]  Please. This is gonna be easy. I was scared for nothing. All right. I'm gonna give...
[5038.22s -> 5045.74s]  I'm gonna give bloodlust to the basilisks or the... Maybe the magma elementals.
[5046.62s -> 5054.52s]  No, the basilisks. Or the brux. Check out their abilities. Unlimited retaliations.
[5055.16s -> 5067.93s]  So that means that they will attack back every single time. Haste the archer. Yeah. All right.
[5067.93s -> 5074.25s]  I'm gonna defend. I'm gonna bloodlust. I'm gonna haste the dwarves, right? And just send them
[5074.25s -> 5084.55s]  out there. Fuck them. Haste the dwarves? Just get them out there? Yeah. You defend.
[5087.51s -> 5091.11s]  Basilisks, I'm gonna stick them right here. They're not gonna move because I think they
[5091.11s -> 5098.79s]  have to go. And the magma... Get the magma out there too. Yeah. Step it out a little bit.
[5100.55s -> 5112.17s]  You stay. Gnolls don't move. Let's shoot down. Let's shoot at you. See, they can't make it.
[5112.73s -> 5143.02s]  Now I'll have... Wait, why could you do that? These things suck. Just kill them. Why won't
[5143.02s -> 5168.44s]  they do anything? Why are the dwarves freezing in panic? I just hasted them. They have low
[5168.44s -> 5174.20s]  morale. Well, I did pretty good. And then we get all this stuff. And I might have to wait
[5174.20s -> 5180.12s]  till another turn. Yes. Look at all this. Artifact. Boots of speed. Gold. Oak trees.
[5180.76s -> 5187.72s]  What are... Oh, no. That's just oak trees. Okay. Never mind. I thought it was wood. Okay.
[5188.76s -> 5197.61s]  Things looking up. 15. Look at all this money. I think I'm gonna be really greedy.
[5197.61s -> 5204.25s]  I don't think I'm just gonna take like 20 grand. No, play long, long game. Long game.
[5204.25s -> 5226.63s]  Long game. Basic scouting or advanced earth magic. Yeah. I said that in like a YouTube
[5226.63s -> 5233.35s]  voice, but I know I did, but I don't care. I'm excited about that. One on the finger.
[5233.35s -> 5237.19s]  This item increases your luck and morale by plus one. Maybe the dwarves will actually
[5237.19s -> 5255.64s]  fucking move now. Six mercury. Six gems. 700 gold. And boots of speed. One on feet.
[5255.64s -> 5264.62s]  These boots increase a hero's movement rate over land. That's amazing. Finally. Did I
[5264.62s -> 5271.99s]  miss anything? I got everything, right? I think that's good. I think I've cleaned it up.
[5277.82s -> 5283.02s]  All right. Nobody in the area. I can come back and claim some stuff. And then...
[5284.60s -> 5289.08s]  Yeah, this is looking good. This is looking good. How much money do I got? Stack it up.
[5289.96s -> 5300.86s]  I need 10,000 for the capital. What are we? Day five? Let me get the wyvern nest.
[5309.08s -> 5317.90s]  Take over the other cities. Yeah. I mean, I'll be able to. What do you got? Few, few,
[5317.90s -> 5322.54s]  few. Dude, I think I'm gonna... Here's my plan. I've already... I did like the magical,
[5322.54s -> 5329.02s]  like hidden secret area. I'm gonna get out of here. I'm gonna go back to the house.
[5329.02s -> 5336.44s]  I'm gonna stack and have like a hundred of all these. And then this person's gonna be the
[5336.44s -> 5350.95s]  conqueror. And I did just get those boots, so let's see how well they work. That's pretty
[5350.95s -> 5357.35s]  good. I mean, that's pretty good. I'm going a lot further, I think. Is that just placebo
[5357.35s -> 5368.26s]  effect or what? I forgot the oak. Oh, whatever. Okay, whatever. I need to turn
[5368.26s -> 5372.74s]  this into a capital. Let's do... I could do... No, I could upgrade the wyvern nest for the
[5372.74s -> 5392.26s]  next week. Yes. Wyvern monarchs. 70, 18, 22. That is much better. I'll have plenty of time to do
[5392.26s -> 5396.41s]  other stuff because it's gonna take another couple days for me to get back here so I can
[5396.41s -> 5416.76s]  do like the mage guild. Lots of griffins. Get the fuck out of my way. All right, let's go
[5416.76s -> 5429.21s]  back. I can do mage guild level two. It's a bunch of resources. I can learn new spells.
[5434.25s -> 5441.03s]  And let's recruit. All right, now I'm going to save money. By the time I get back there,
[5441.03s -> 5448.57s]  I want to have to be a capital. Purple's dead. Purple's heroes have abandoned him.
[5448.57s -> 5454.90s]  He is banished from the land. There are now six that remain. Bye purple. It was really nice
[5454.90s -> 5468.68s]  knowing you. Oh boy, that's a lot. 50. That's 50 griffins. Oh fuck. All right,
[5468.76s -> 5482.66s]  send in the dwarves. Send in the dwarves. Hide everybody except the dwarves. All right,
[5483.22s -> 5491.80s]  where do you want me? Walk straight ahead into the 50 griffins. Do you think that's wise? No,
[5493.61s -> 5515.98s]  not at all. Oh, what's this? Nice! And bloodlust and haste. Everybody else chill.
[5520.73s -> 5535.38s]  We're all just watching. Is he going to do it? Move it. I'm coming through. Death comes for you.
[5538.49s -> 5556.92s]  Everybody stay. Just support the dwarves. Bloodlust. He's got extra luck. They're dead.
[5557.48s -> 5570.31s]  It's okay. It's all right. They got rid of seven. Not very lucky. Six dwarves die. Oh,
[5570.79s -> 5581.58s]  hmm. I gotta send the magma guys in. A new hero approaches. What? Why do I have to do this?
[5582.81s -> 5598.12s]  Because you don't come from our castle. What? What does that mean? It means I can't make any
[5598.12s -> 5604.14s]  of you, so I have to fill my stacks with people that I have in my castle. But do you
[5604.14s -> 5609.42s]  see how strong I've been for you? Have you even seen what I've done for you?
[5610.22s -> 5632.50s]  Well, prove it. Show me. You're an idiot. You let him go by. You let him go by. You shouldn't
[5632.50s -> 5644.02s]  have let him do that. You've killed everybody. Come on. Show why. Now everyone's going to fight
[5644.02s -> 5661.40s]  now. Nope. Run away. Send the dolls in. Block the path. Lucky shot. Good.
[5670.33s -> 5712.42s]  What do I do? I'm not doing that. Purple's dead. I'm going a long way. I'm not losing
[5712.42s -> 5721.51s]  all my... I'm not losing all my basilisks to 50 griffins. Wait, purple died this time. No,
[5721.51s -> 5727.16s]  you're not purple. Yeah, purple died. Plus I can reclaim this stuff. Yeah, no, I'm going a long
[5727.16s -> 5745.27s]  way. Wait! Harpies. So much for not save scumming. Yeah, but sometimes you have to.
[5745.27s -> 5752.89s]  I'm playing a win. I'm playing a win. See, we still have one dwarf. Six thousand. I can
[5752.89s -> 5765.14s]  do the citadel capital coming up real soon. Don't buy anything. I've got a mercury
[5765.14s -> 5777.90s]  factory that I'm going to reclaim. Cliff nest. Get the rocks. No, what? What are you talking
[5777.90s -> 5795.45s]  about? I already cleared it out. Did they already like me? 10,000 not yet. Tan came in here.
[5800.57s -> 5806.12s]  Well, whatever. I don't really want... I don't really want the rocks. I'll give you a very
[5806.12s -> 5811.56s]  specific reason why. They're good, but they're kind of just gonna take up space
[5812.52s -> 5818.60s]  and the dwarves and the rocks, they're good, but they're gonna just take up space and I need
[5818.60s -> 5831.24s]  more of my own units. Did I already go here? Holy shit. Yep. Okay. Everything's good. Now
[5831.24s -> 5841.10s]  we're just gonna make our way back down home. 10,000. I can now do the citadel and things
[5841.10s -> 5849.59s]  are looking good. Capital building 4,000 fucking gold every single day until our last day.
[5850.39s -> 5861.56s]  I can put them in the garrison. That's not a bad idea. We're gonna, this is what we're gonna do.
[5861.56s -> 5872.74s]  Yeah, we're gonna dump. Let's touch the rally flag first. What's over here? That's a lot
[5872.74s -> 5884.46s]  of griffins to be guarding something over here for no reason. What is this? Odd. All right,
[5884.46s -> 5893.06s]  let's get the rocks, the dwarves, and the magma men in the garrison or keep the magma men.
[5893.06s -> 5918.02s]  That's good. Let us recruit. I got 6,000 gold. More hiring. What you gonna do?
[5918.82s -> 5924.12s]  Wait two. That's because I'm trying to get these like out of the monarchs, right?
[5924.12s -> 5936.52s]  Okay, we'll do it next week. Get you guys upgraded to the better ones. I want to see
[5936.52s -> 5945.67s]  where is that nest. 70 health. 70 health. This is 14, 14, 14 to 18, 14, 14, 18 to 22,
[5945.67s -> 5962.44s]  and faster. Nice. Okay. You head out of here with one dwarf, please. You're gonna transfer
[5962.44s -> 5966.52s]  this dwarf. You're gonna go sit in the garrison. I'm gonna get another hero.
[5966.52s -> 5980.97s]  You thought this place is called mud shit? No. It's not called mud shit. All right.
[5981.77s -> 5996.06s]  We're back. Now we're gonna restock. Pretty damn good. All right. I need more gnolls. I got
[5996.06s -> 6014.98s]  lots of money. I'm gonna send you up to the garrison. Are these bulls? These bulls are
[6014.98s -> 6026.10s]  upgraded. Mighty Gorgons, yeah. They're not upgraded? I thought they were. No, I didn't.
[6029.34s -> 6034.71s]  Hydropond is the next thing coming up. Or mage guild level up. I think mage guild.
[6035.35s -> 6047.14s]  Yeah, they're leveled up already. You hang out in here for a minute. You get in the
[6047.14s -> 6069.61s]  garrison. Can I not put you up here? I guess he can't go in the garrison. Okay. Well,
[6073.59s -> 6082.14s]  I kind of need to send him out to do stuff. He's gonna go explore up here while I get this
[6082.14s -> 6087.78s]  hero ready to go. We went down last time. I'm gonna go up. I'm gonna go this way.
[6087.78s -> 6103.40s]  He's just a scout at this point. One dwarf scout army. That's probably a really stupid
[6103.40s -> 6109.18s]  idea, but you know, I'm going for it. What's the worst that's gonna happen? He's
[6109.18s -> 6125.96s]  gonna die. He's a level two. Okay, we need some more. Got more bulls. I just need more cash. I
[6125.96s -> 6132.07s]  need more money. I gotta get in that guy. I gotta conquer. You're coming down here. What's
[6132.07s -> 6140.87s]  this look like here? Several pack and then lots. Several. What is that? This is Jabarcas.
[6147.19s -> 6157.69s]  Yeah, go explore. Go explore. Get us some resources. Get us some money. I can get 27 of
[6157.69s -> 6165.05s]  these. More of these. Good. 73 lizard warriors. I might even split these up.
[6165.69s -> 6172.41s]  I think here's what's... hear me out on this. Get to a hundred lizard warriors
[6173.29s -> 6179.45s]  and get a new hero that is just a, you know, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15. Just have all
[6180.17s -> 6201.56s]  archers. Like 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15. And then send them out. Why? To lay the
[6201.64s -> 6219.86s]  smack down. I don't know. You suck at this. I'm doing pretty well right now. I couldn't...
[6219.86s -> 6227.34s]  people came to... okay, he made it over there. He had to have lost shit for that, right? He
[6227.34s -> 6244.22s]  took out three staxi griffins. He's probably weak. Nah, stick with the scout. What is this?
[6244.22s -> 6255.27s]  Warren? Something down here maybe? I got 5,000. That's a new weak. I just... I can get more
[6255.91s -> 6265.00s]  fucking gorgons. God damn it. I have so many of these. All right. I think it's time to,
[6265.00s -> 6269.74s]  I think it's time to take, take her out again. Although the next thing I'm going to do a bunch
[6269.74s -> 6288.58s]  of gnolls. Or should I just stack her to be unbeatable? She will be un... okay, let me
[6288.58s -> 6303.93s]  see what you lost by doing that. Guys, guys, those griffins joined him. If I had just
[6303.93s -> 6324.63s]  walked over there, I would have probably had like a hundred griffins. Damn it. That sucks.
[6325.43s -> 6343.69s]  That really sucks. Would you like to... sure. 14. All right. Ogre fort. What was anything down
[6343.69s -> 6346.25s]  here? I wonder if it... is it worth checking to see if there's something like on the edge here?
[6347.21s -> 6368.73s]  Just gonna check. Nothing. I could still kill him. Should I just go after him right now with
[6368.73s -> 6383.78s]  this army? One more day. One more day. Recruit everybody. I don't have enough money. Let him
[6383.78s -> 6398.68s]  at least go through the garrison first. Yeah, that's true. There he goes. 31. They're not that good.
[6398.68s -> 6406.28s]  Okay, 31. Holy, he's got... what the fuck? He's got six cyclops. This is actually a good indicator
[6406.28s -> 6416.33s]  to see what he's got. He's got six cyclops. Oh man. He's got five behemoths. This is what
[6416.33s -> 6427.90s]  throws us over the edge. Bad. Very badly. If only I had like tried to pursue that,
[6427.90s -> 6432.54s]  I would have had these griffins. And that changes everything.
[6435.72s -> 6443.00s]  Uh, I mean, I'm just gonna fly around and just have him come to us. Maybe I could take out
[6443.00s -> 6452.17s]  somebody? No. It's impossible. I'm not gonna be able to kill one person.
[6453.69s -> 6468.28s]  Yeah, this game will... I can't even attack. I killed six of their riders.
[6468.28s -> 6475.93s]  And now he didn't even want to come down. He's coming down. Well, it's gonna be a fight.
[6477.70s -> 6505.22s]  It's gonna be a fight. Give me some more archers. 87 archers. He might not come all the way down.
[6505.86s -> 6520.36s]  This ogre hut right here. Let me just go up this way. Claim that. I have that claimed,
[6520.36s -> 6526.07s]  that claimed. Blue is up here. I don't think I can do anything with this.
[6527.40s -> 6536.14s]  All right, let's see what happens here. No. He just took... all right, he turned.
[6542.26s -> 6557.96s]  Open field? I don't know if that's a good idea. More archers. A hundred. They have a hundred
[6557.96s -> 6574.26s]  fucking archers. Let's see. Let me take a look at the garrison. He left his riders in the
[6574.26s -> 6583.93s]  garrison. But he's got such power units. He's got such heavy units. He's gonna have to come
[6583.93s -> 6589.99s]  to me. I'm not gonna risk it. Can I claim this and take ogres? I can. I'll do that next
[6589.99s -> 6619.46s]  turn. It's like this guy can have at least something. This is like the battle. Here it
[6619.46s -> 6631.75s]  comes. Here we go. Here we go. Minimal casualties. But did she not learn the spells?
[6632.23s -> 6637.78s]  Didn't upgrade it to level two or three? I'm just going with... who's the most dangerous
[6637.78s -> 6649.96s]  here? Somebody can fly over. I'm thinking of... this is range. The cyclops has to go.
[6653.82s -> 6667.45s]  These two... that'll be a fight. Five cyclops. Gotta go for it. Four. All right, grab the bat.
[6667.45s -> 6675.16s]  Don't move. There's no reason to go out there. Just have to defend. Are you ranged? I mean,
[6676.94s -> 6688.44s]  do I just dive out? Okay. These are pretty beefy. 70 health, 1822. I mean, I could
[6688.44s -> 6699.86s]  probably kill a... stay just to defend. All right. The ball... what are the... what's the
[6699.86s -> 6710.76s]  ball stats? Pretty beefy. I could... to stay... hold the line. Oh! You can do that?
[6712.22s -> 6729.40s]  Since when can you do that? That was... fuck yeah. I got to do it twice. I got the once
[6729.40s -> 6741.99s]  again. All right. Now who do I buff with this? I'm buff... should I buff the archers? I think you
[6741.99s -> 6754.20s]  have to. They're the only ones that can do anything. It's defense. I don't want anyone
[6754.20s -> 6759.21s]  to die. They're the only ones that can do anything. All right. Now we've got the healing
[6759.21s -> 6767.42s]  tent. Who got the axe thrown in their face? You did. They're getting in line here. They're
[6767.42s -> 6779.58s]  not... I might not lose like very many at all. Magic arrow and we'll go for... they're just in a
[6779.58s -> 6817.56s]  line. This is like a diner dash. We're going for the front of the line. Catapult. Oh my god.
[6829.83s -> 6856.41s]  Buff, buff, buff. They're trying to get in. Oh, crash. Nobody move. Don't ever... nobody
[6856.41s -> 6869.66s]  fucking move. Oh, he's in. It's okay. He's in. He's poisoned. Get in there. Get up there. Smash
[6869.66s -> 6889.19s]  him. Right in front of you. And extra lucky. Oh my god, dude. I can't... I didn't lose anybody.
[6889.19s -> 6899.86s]  I'm gonna get so much experience. I lost like five people. Don't anybody move. It's too
[6899.86s -> 6922.98s]  dangerous. Get the fuck out of here. He lost everything. He lost all his shit. Everybody.
[6924.02s -> 6930.04s]  Blue is now in a lot of trouble. That was like their biggest units. Advanced sorcerer.
[6933.48s -> 6951.02s]  Basic intelligence. Maximum spell points or expert earth magic. Gone. Now we do this thing called
[6952.28s -> 6966.76s]  I want my mage tower to be higher. Mage build level two. Weakness. Disrupting ray. Ice bolt.
[6966.76s -> 6981.74s]  Quicksand. All right, good. We're gonna do it again tomorrow. Let's go get our shit. What did he
[6981.74s -> 6995.11s]  take? He only took the ore, huh? Nothing else claimed by him except up here. The 100 archers
[6995.11s -> 7001.83s]  is very strong. Yeah, it's very good. Uh, I mean, this garrison is just dumb. I don't really
[7001.83s -> 7008.14s]  care. I'll just get it back later. Continue the exploration. Actually, no, I'm one of the
[7008.14s -> 7013.94s]  ogres, right? Well, let's just, is there something I can claim like up here? We can go up this way.
[7013.94s -> 7028.50s]  Mage tower. Magic plains. Yeah, I'm just gonna wait. Here comes Tan. Oh, fine. You don't. Wait.
[7030.38s -> 7042.34s]  Burger Prince is dead. Is Burger Prince out? Burger Prince doesn't have anything.
[7042.90s -> 7050.36s]  I think we just retreat here. There's no reason to have anybody do this. One dwarf and 14
[7051.24s -> 7061.08s]  trolls. That's it. See you later. The cowardly jerel flees from battle.
[7061.88s -> 7081.08s]  It doesn't matter. Mage tower. Level three. Let's take a look. Earthquake randomly damages
[7081.08s -> 7086.52s]  two sections of castle wall in combat. Half the selected enemy unit forgets to use its
[7086.52s -> 7092.46s]  ranged attack and fireball burst into flames fire damage to the target and adjacent units.
[7099.42s -> 7111.83s]  All right. It is time to take you out. I now have a very, very good formidable offense.
[7112.63s -> 7120.41s]  Well, maybe I should do one more day. Yeah, well, next week. One week. Two more days.
[7121.53s -> 7130.30s]  Two more days. That's it. Just two more days. All right. Did that. Two more days.
[7130.94s -> 7142.18s]  God damn it, man. And that will get me another tower in the, in the, no, I got
[7142.18s -> 7151.91s]  a level three cage of warlords defense and strength plus two to a garrison. No, just save
[7154.30s -> 7163.58s]  hydra pond. I could get hydras. Oh, that can be on another hero though. I got to get out.
[7163.58s -> 7175.35s]  I got to get moving. I've got to get out here. What did tan hold on to tan just like,
[7175.99s -> 7188.62s]  I can kill them right now. It's time to go. I can do it right now. Give me more height.
[7188.62s -> 7194.34s]  Give me more of these. I got to get somebody out there. Look at this. This army is fucking
[7194.34s -> 7210.86s]  insane. 35, like 20, 30 bulls, 116 archers. Like, I just, I got to get, I got to start
[7210.86s -> 7222.14s]  conquering. This is good because then another hero can start stacking. I got all the spells
[7222.14s -> 7261.21s]  learned, right? Do I have the spells learned? No, I do. Okay. Come on. Sell, sell the ore.
[7262.01s -> 7281.32s]  But I, it's, I need it. It's only 25. How much are dragonflies for one? Oh god, he like two
[7281.32s -> 7318.33s]  grand. Oh, that's so many. Come on. What else can I do? A little bit. No, no, that's it. That's
[7318.33s -> 7332.38s]  it. That's it. That's it. That's it. 125 nulls, 126 nulls. Let's go. A new hero can come in
[7332.38s -> 7338.52s]  tomorrow. I am stacked. No one will fucking defeat me at this stage. Not even close.
[7339.32s -> 7346.54s]  There's just hobgoblins hanging out over here now. Oh, it's because it's the month of the hobgoblin.
[7347.88s -> 7360.89s]  Oh, well that makes sense. Nobody in this garrison go. Why would you go? Well, lots of hobgoblins.
[7360.89s -> 7367.66s]  Get out of the fucking way. Why do I have to go all the way around? I can't just,
[7371.86s -> 7399.86s]  hey, thanks for killing it. He's dead. Goodbye. Oh, you are pathetic. Look at your
[7399.86s -> 7405.06s]  pathetic army next to my large army with all the dragons and the magma and the
[7407.27s -> 7415.99s]  earthquake. Oh, do you have fucking fireball? Oh, what's that? Oh, sorry. Am I gonna fireball
[7415.99s -> 7429.91s]  the fuck out of you? I'm thinking fireball the centaurs. Whoa, what's this? What's like the
[7429.91s -> 7436.47s]  cousin it? Psychic elemental attacks all adjacent enemies without retaliation. Mind spell immunity.
[7436.47s -> 7445.53s]  Okay, kill this immediately. Fireball down here. That's not a mind spell. Fireball.
[7445.53s -> 7454.54s]  Hit the griffon and hit everything down here. Bingo. You got nothing. You have nothing.
[7457.06s -> 7464.58s]  And in fact, I could probably fly over with my bugs and just start killing. But maybe I won't.
[7484.30s -> 7497.46s]  Get out of here. You realize what's happening. He must have had something really, really good.
[7500.52s -> 7504.04s]  Because why would you? I mean, he retreated. He deleted all those minions.
[7506.17s -> 7511.18s]  All right, we're gonna go up, up here. Let's hit the rally point.
[7516.06s -> 7548.57s]  He is. Oh, it's no, it's Gibrakas. Wait, new hero time.
[7558.71s -> 7564.15s]  Merlinda the witch or Luna the old enemy. I think it's gonna be
[7565.11s -> 7584.71s]  elementalist or witch. The witch. Let's get you some minions. Pretty cool.
[7584.71s -> 7596.92s]  Pretty good. Witch. What's your specialty? Is weakness. Better effect. In just a moment,
[7596.92s -> 7600.84s]  after another week, you're going to be heading out yourself with a stacked group of
[7602.78s -> 7616.28s]  minions. It's a stacked group of minions. Just nothing over here. Somebody already took it.
[7617.08s -> 7623.00s]  All right. Super north or right? I think I want to do. What's the sanctuary?
[7623.56s -> 7643.56s]  I want to go that way. Super north? No, look at this. A thousand experience. Sanctuary. Great
[7643.56s -> 7651.67s]  weight has been lifted. You feel safe. I don't think I can be attacked here. I don't think
[7651.67s -> 7662.12s]  I can be attacked. I'm going up this way. What do you got over here? This is a little
[7662.12s -> 7676.34s]  standoff. Hole. Should I check the hole? No, I'm in the hole. Why do the fucking hole
[7676.34s -> 7690.28s]  just make me do that? I didn't even want to do that. Hole. Hydro punt. How much are the
[7690.28s -> 7705.96s]  upgraded hydras? I can do it tomorrow. I don't like that route you're taking. It's really
[7705.96s -> 7714.76s]  pissing me off. I'm going to go beige tower. No, up here. I want this experience. A thousand
[7714.76s -> 7731.27s]  experience. Thousand exp. There is a sawmill right here. Grab this. Almost there. Fifteen
[7731.27s -> 7754.65s]  thousand. Taking all my shit. Something that way. Yep, sulfur. Fourteen thousand. I'm almost
[7754.65s -> 7770.38s]  there. I now have ultra hydras. He's coming after you? I don't think he is. I mean,
[7770.38s -> 7781.35s]  I'm about to meet him. I'm about to go down that way. Yeah, this is his like shitty guy.
[7781.91s -> 7788.95s]  He's got like a few, few, few and a bunch of dumb skeletons. This is his main. Might be
[7788.95s -> 7798.47s]  time for an open field battle. And then head up this way. Or head down here and check out
[7798.47s -> 7819.83s]  the other quadrant. Yeah. Where are you off to? Did you just recruit those or did you kill them?
[7819.83s -> 7839.40s]  I swear to god if you recruited them. Nope. You had to fight them. Hello. Upgraded hydra
[7839.40s -> 7849.43s]  pond. Chaos hydras. Regular hydras. 135 health. 250 health. Attacks all adjacent enemies
[7849.43s -> 7872.22s]  and cannot. Enemies cannot retaliate. 21 defense. In a few days you'll be able to take
[7872.22s -> 7880.34s]  your venture of your own. Your move. Oh, don't get away from him. He's so strong.
[7880.34s -> 7898.41s]  Fuck out of here. Let me back my stuff. Well, he's dead now. I got you locked in here.
[7899.40s -> 7909.72s]  You got a boat? I don't see a boat. Did you get them? Did you take those worthless things?
[7910.52s -> 7929.48s]  Oh, you did, didn't you? Here comes Tan. Uh oh, there's a battle going on over here.
[7929.48s -> 7954.36s]  Okay. Uh, no. That's mine. Here we go. Here comes the big one. Fireball weakness maybe. Or just
[7954.36s -> 7960.57s]  fireball. Right in the middle here. Fireball right here. This will get all three of them.
[7963.03s -> 7969.11s]  More fireball down here. Do I want to hit more units or do I want to get rid of
[7969.99s -> 7976.06s]  the water minions? I think I'm thinking right in the middle here. This is perfect.
[7976.06s -> 7984.44s]  I get the tent too. Let's go for it. Yeah. I hope that was worth you like $3,000.
[7985.40s -> 8000.63s]  Okay. The big bad guy here is the behemoth. Oh, 300 fucking health. Focus. Oh, this is not good.
[8000.63s -> 8012.66s]  I gotta focus behemoth. Actually, like fucking, it's 1200 HP. Uh, I don't know if I want to,
[8012.66s -> 8017.06s]  do I just, I think it's time to, we just gotta go in. How many are here? 250 hobgoblins.
[8023.16s -> 8033.42s]  Who's ranged here? I don't think they have ranged. Unless these guys throw axes or
[8033.42s -> 8038.14s]  something, right? Don't these guys throw? No. No, they don't have any range. Well, they,
[8038.14s -> 8050.22s]  no, they don't. No fucking ranged at all. I just got fucking, all right. I gotta,
[8050.22s -> 8058.49s]  you have, I gotta fight back here. Oh, you can move across the whole fucking map.
[8059.21s -> 8084.84s]  I'm gonna have to petrifying attack. You gotta go to, I just have to try to help
[8084.84s -> 8093.35s]  and get rid of you. Nice. Come on. Let me go with the Gorgon. All right. Should we send
[8093.35s -> 8102.38s]  him to slime? Okay. I'm going to buff Gorgon. Buff Gorgon. Gorgon. Go after the behemoth.
[8104.81s -> 8109.62s]  Sacrifice the magmas. No, no, no, no, no. We're going to slime. Slime the Gorgons.
[8109.62s -> 8133.82s]  Here we go. Death stare. Protection. Go for it. Here we go. Fuck just happened.
[8134.38s -> 8143.51s]  I just killed two. I just killed two behemoths in one hit. Are you kidding me?
[8144.23s -> 8151.18s]  I get to go again. Oh, nice. God damn it. I could have been able to attack you.
[8152.30s -> 8170.44s]  Oh, you're still alive. He's still alive. No. All right. Snake is going to go take out the
[8170.44s -> 8180.82s]  minions in the back here. Right here. Wait. Fireball. These guys. I might be able to get
[8180.82s -> 8192.25s]  rid of most of them. Or Fireball right here. I think I'm going to Fireball right in the
[8192.25s -> 8210.17s]  middle and then do bloodlust. I could, that was pretty, that was good. That's pretty good.
[8210.17s -> 8217.16s]  All right. Now clean them up. Snake. Into the back. Snipe. There's like three there.
[8217.16s -> 8230.17s]  Snipe in the back. Ow. Okay. Dragon. Go for behemoth. I think we still have to
[8230.17s -> 8248.50s]  surround the behemoth. What does he have? Two? He might have like, okay. All right.
[8248.50s -> 8251.30s]  Only one more. Where are you going? You're going to the archers. No, you're not.
[8252.26s -> 8261.37s]  Why would you go for the gnolls? Behemoth is dead. 252 of these guys coming in.
[8262.17s -> 8275.29s]  Oh wow. Magma. Get in there. 214. I just killed like 60. Bulls. Up here. Up here. Up here. Up
[8275.29s -> 8288.95s]  here. Kill the Hydra. The dragon. Yes. I still can't, I can't cast any spells. All right.
[8288.95s -> 8304.71s]  Bring them up. Bring up the gnolls. I win. There are some casualties, but I mean like,
[8306.23s -> 8317.13s]  I did it. Basic logistics. Movement over land. Yes. Advanced logistics. 20% more movement over
[8317.13s -> 8328.60s]  land. Uh, that's awesome. Let me get this back. It's already there. Okay. Looking good.
[8329.24s -> 8337.96s]  Now what about you? You have several big scary birds. I'm going to keep moving with this
[8337.96s -> 8345.22s]  group. I want to come back up here. Claim. I'll claim my stuff back. Nothing else.
[8345.22s -> 8362.63s]  Is this just disappear? Back to the citadel. Let's get another team going. Now you're coming
[8362.63s -> 8365.91s]  down here. Why? Okay. Why? Why do I always have to deal with the fucking asshole that
[8365.91s -> 8371.18s]  has like the shitload of enemies? I keep like preventing you from coming down. All right.
[8372.06s -> 8398.46s]  I need to head back out again. You guys just taking up space. Okay. There we go. 48 of these
[8399.42s -> 8409.58s]  in a room because of, let's take it. I have to go restock. I got these chaos hydras though.
[8409.58s -> 8426.02s]  So these things are fucking insane. Oh, there's two gnolls. All right. Restock. I'll be able to
[8426.02s -> 8431.86s]  have probably five. I'll have at least five chaos hydras, which now I become the behemoth.
[8432.50s -> 8438.04s]  Right? No. Do I want to get up here and claim? Did you take anything else over here?
[8438.04s -> 8447.86s]  He took this. I want this back. What is it? Sulfur. Is it worth me taking a detour? No.
[8447.86s -> 8464.52s]  Just get back. Just get back into town. Not worth taking a detour for. All right. Now.
[8466.09s -> 8481.35s]  Here we go. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Magma. Magma has to be traded. For chaos? I mean,
[8481.35s -> 8495.03s]  five chaos hydras. Magma or? I mean, this is a destructive team. You can keep the gnolls.
[8495.59s -> 8512.02s]  Gnolls for magma. Yeah. The magma can't be replenished. That's true. I could wait another
[8512.02s -> 8524.39s]  day. Yeah. I'm going to leave magma, but I'm going to wait one more day because I want,
[8525.37s -> 8548.54s]  uh, I want, I want to take more. I want more. One more week. Give me more.
[8549.10s -> 8577.38s]  Okay. Hey Red. You're fucking dead. Okay. Okay. I want some archer. No, just go. I'm ready.
[8578.98s -> 8591.99s]  Save it. Red has, uh, what? Okay. What denomination turns into a throng? Is it a
[8591.99s -> 8603.26s]  hundred or is it more than a hundred? It's a hundred plus. Okay. So I have a throng of,
[8604.74s -> 8617.94s]  and then what? Lots is between what? 50 and a hundred. I mean, this would be,
[8617.94s -> 8632.15s]  this is very equal. It's very even. And a horde is what? More than 500? A horde is 50 to me.
[8632.15s -> 8637.27s]  All right. I'm going up. It's time. I'm not coming back again. I've got my army. This is
[8637.27s -> 8642.60s]  the army that I'm going to use. I'm going straight up. No, no, no. I can't go straight
[8642.60s -> 8648.84s]  up. I can say, yeah, I can. So whatever's left, I need to start taking cities and
[8648.84s -> 8659.80s]  buildings and stuff. Red's going to make their way to the right. I'm going to go north. I'm
[8659.80s -> 8668.71s]  going right up that road and I'm going to have a second army. Yeah, I'll have a second army.
[8669.35s -> 8673.72s]  Let's go investigate what's up here. Is it a road? It does lead to here. I'll take this
[8674.44s -> 8681.11s]  and there's a little lake here. I'm not going to forget about my second hero.
[8690.31s -> 8703.69s]  Keep going. Nobody in your garrison. It's mine now. All right. We're crossing into
[8703.69s -> 8714.18s]  uncharted territory. Another, you have two garrisons. Ooh, this is like undead world.
[8714.90s -> 8729.42s]  I can't even go up there. All right. Starting to build a little bit of a force here. I get
[8729.42s -> 8734.39s]  the magma guy here. What about building? Blood obelisk. I'm going to do some of these.
[8738.42s -> 8741.78s]  Plus two to a garrison hero's attack when defending against a siege. I'm going to get it.
[8742.90s -> 8754.81s]  I'm going for Red's castle. I think Red is up here, right? Red or Tan?
[8755.53s -> 8769.54s]  Blue's dead. Blue is no more. There are five remaining. Tons of resources up here that I
[8769.54s -> 8777.94s]  can just take. Should I go up here? I feel like this is... I need to see what it is.
[8778.66s -> 8788.84s]  Anything else? Cage of warlords increases the defense of the hero. Should just get
[8788.84s -> 8795.18s]  to plus one defense and I think I am maxed the fuck out besides the shipyard. This is my
[8795.18s -> 8825.08s]  ultra capital. Here he comes. Teal is dead. Uh-oh! No! Is there a castle up here? I hope
[8825.08s -> 8840.55s]  you got it. It's not a castle! I thought that was a castle. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8840.55s -> 8847.62s]  He might not come all the way down here. He might not come down here. Nope. He didn't come
[8847.62s -> 8864.94s]  down. We're good. Something's right fucking here. All right. We just made... Okay. Give
[8864.94s -> 8872.82s]  me those chaos hydras. Give me some of these wyverns. Bulls. Okay. We're... Everything's
[8872.82s -> 8928.98s]  going to be all right. He's got fucking phoenixes. Well, I kind of just lose. There's
[8928.98s -> 8945.22s]  not much I can do. I might have to reload. There's not much that could be done. I think
[8945.22s -> 8959.85s]  if I lose this castle, I lose because I was wasting time. Well, I thought there could
[8959.85s -> 8966.74s]  have been a town up there. It don't matter. I'm just going to go straight this time
[8967.62s -> 8981.37s]  and I'll be able to take the castle straight from the road. Yeah, but I mean,
[8981.37s -> 8988.49s]  this is like tons of little paths you can go around. All right. I think I lose. No, not
[8988.49s -> 8992.41s]  quite. Green's dead. You only have seven days to capture a town or you'll be banished
[8992.41s -> 9008.10s]  from the land. I mean, I would have done things differently. I would have done it a little
[9008.10s -> 9021.88s]  differently. Let's just see what's up here. This is orange. Do you have a castle right here?
[9028.87s -> 9039.61s]  How far up is your castle? It's like all the way up there, huh?
[9043.78s -> 9045.86s]  Take it? I mean, I don't know if I'm going to be able to take it. I might
[9045.86s -> 9057.80s]  have to reload. New home. I don't know if it's going to be new home. It might be. Let's
[9057.80s -> 9086.89s]  find a new home. Let's see if it's a new home. Hey, can I have your house? Oh, I have earthquake.
[9086.89s -> 9091.45s]  Oh my God. I'm just so distracted by how annoyed I am at losing my fucking capital.
[9092.65s -> 9101.91s]  Well, we can just get in. How should I go after here? I'm using a fireball and a siege.
[9105.70s -> 9115.24s]  I know I'll probably win this, but at what cost? 250 health. Two to five damage. It's
[9115.24s -> 9117.48s]  not going to be enough. I don't think I'm going to be able to kill it. I'm going to
[9117.48s -> 9134.20s]  try and kill the bulls or the basilisks. I don't feel the kill though. I'm just going to go for
[9134.20s -> 9140.31s]  like the fucking basilisks that have the least amount of health. We'll just go right here and
[9140.31s -> 9150.90s]  see what happens. Kill in one hit? Yes. I get to go again. Perfect. Let me get minimal losses
[9150.90s -> 9161.24s]  here and it won't be a complete waste. Why in with the dragon? Yeah, just kill that.
[9162.20s -> 9177.06s]  Why would you attack this? Basilisks can't get in. You can move over. Can you knock it in either?
[9177.06s -> 9188.76s]  Hydra can't get in. Nobody else can get in actually. It's the same faction. Yeah,
[9188.76s -> 9204.49s]  we might just be trading castles. Not dead. You're still alive. That seems fucking ridiculous.
[9204.49s -> 9220.68s]  There's only one of you. Kill it. Holy shit. How do you still have one? I've done like
[9221.24s -> 9243.66s]  four or five hundred damage. What the fuck? I can do this.
[9245.90s -> 9257.93s]  Didn't do anything. I still can't get in there. I didn't do anything. It just like
[9257.93s -> 9268.89s]  shook the ground for a second. Who's in? There's still you, the bulls. What do you
[9268.89s -> 9275.69s]  got? Eleven. Let's go for the bulls. I'm not even fucking hurting these things.
[9282.52s -> 9289.37s]  Ninety-five archers can't even kill one bull. You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[9289.45s -> 9333.00s]  That's 39 of these things. Hooray. Hello. Kill. Kill. I'll go in next. I'll just hang out here.
[9333.48s -> 9354.36s]  I'm gonna be healing somebody. Can you move, please? What should I do? Fucking magic arrow.
[9354.36s -> 9361.54s]  Ice bolt. Let's just ice bolt this motherfucker. Let's kill him. There's just the
[9361.54s -> 9368.82s]  nulls and I have a new town. I kind of died but I lost a lot but I'll get a ton of experience.
[9369.46s -> 9378.36s]  Forty-four hundred. It's the same town. It's the same one. Let's just hope that they build
[9378.36s -> 9389.72s]  up their town as much as I built up mine. Expert sorcery. Fifty percent more damage.
[9392.70s -> 9400.22s]  What does it look like? All right, well you don't have a capital but I can get that
[9400.78s -> 9406.12s]  very soon. What about the dickhead that's right here? He's gonna kill him right now.
[9406.68s -> 9412.52s]  Wipe out. I'm gonna kill green. I'm literally gonna wipe out orange. I have enough to get rid of him,
[9412.52s -> 9418.63s]  I think. He only he has like a pack of lots. Pack pack. He doesn't have like he's several.
[9419.98s -> 9426.86s]  Not green. I'm talking about orange. Yeah, I think I can take him. Let him attack but I
[9426.86s -> 9433.75s]  don't think he won't. He'll run away. He's gonna run away. I want to eliminate orange.
[9433.75s -> 9455.67s]  Here we go because I've got five. He has five. I have 12. He has 10. Yeah, I'm gonna win
[9455.67s -> 9465.00s]  this. I got 39 fucking bulls. He's dead. 160. Yeah, these guys are terrible. This is like
[9465.00s -> 9470.82s]  having gnolls. They're not that good. All right, priority target is the titans.
[9471.54s -> 9484.90s]  Could just throw a fireball over here and we'll throw a fireball here or I could do
[9485.46s -> 9491.99s]  bloodlust on the hydras or I could yeah I could do an ice bolt on the titans.
[9493.53s -> 9500.04s]  Actually, I like that idea. I like the ice bolt on the titans or weakness or
[9500.28s -> 9504.68s]  yeah let me do that. Randomly places eight small patches of quicksand on the battlefield
[9504.68s -> 9507.56s]  which are only visible to the caster and creatures native to the terrain.
[9508.76s -> 9512.04s]  Walking into quicksand ends a unit's movement for the turn and makes it visible.
[9515.48s -> 9526.70s]  I'll bolt them. Took away one. None of them have a lot of movement besides the
[9526.70s -> 9529.66s]  genie and the genie flying over here would be like a terrible mistake.
[9530.78s -> 9538.41s]  So I'm gonna bring you up here. I think I'm just gonna wait or maybe I'll bring you up
[9538.41s -> 9549.91s]  here above and then fly in. Yeah, that's the plan. I'll take you guys out by jumping in.
[9549.91s -> 9557.58s]  Because the range is up here. I get to go again. Unbelievable. Okay, just kill them all in one
[9557.58s -> 9565.06s]  hit. Or the mages. No, I want to be away from those. Kill them all. 165. I just killed over
[9565.06s -> 9576.55s]  a hundred. Didn't I? Wait, only what? I only killed eight? No, who died? Yeah, I killed a
[9576.55s -> 9583.21s]  hundred. All right, now we're gonna meet you halfway. I'm coming up this way. What's your
[9583.21s -> 9591.80s]  movement here? Five. Seven. I'm gonna move like here. Same with you. You can go that way as well.
[9594.62s -> 9611.82s]  Balls into the same thing. Dead. Just dead. Good. Nulls come in. Priority is still the titans so
[9613.18s -> 9626.38s]  or yeah they are. I now can let's heal you. Exactly what I wanted you to do.
[9626.38s -> 9636.31s]  That's exactly what I wanted. So now I think I'm gonna fly you down here. Let's go from
[9636.31s -> 9647.50s]  this angle so I'm not surrounded. Maybe I'll fly you down into the mages. 21 mages perish.
[9648.14s -> 9651.58s]  You still have to walk all the way. Good. I don't care if you kill them.
[9652.38s -> 9660.26s]  That's fine with me. I'm gonna go genies. Yeah, I definitely attacked the genies from
[9660.26s -> 9663.22s]  this side because I want to be able to move the hydras over here too.
[9668.71s -> 9673.24s]  13 genies dead. Again. Actually, you know what? Let's kill the genies.
[9674.04s -> 9682.57s]  Oh, no, no, no, no. You go up here. These titans are gonna come to the archers. Let me see here.
[9683.29s -> 9690.23s]  Ice bolt again on the two. Yeah, you can stick right behind
[9691.11s -> 9698.07s]  because he's gonna kill the null and make one swing so might as well just block it so he
[9698.07s -> 9709.98s]  can't get to the archers. Absolutely crumbled. One last shot. It's okay. You're not that
[9709.98s -> 9734.78s]  strong. Nice. Genies dead. He's not dead. He's still alive. Miraculously. Kill the
[9736.06s -> 9748.02s]  genies. Get rid of them. The mage. Now we just have to deal with you.
[9754.36s -> 9764.33s]  All right. What do I got? Weakness. I can't cast it. Don't have any more. No, I can do
[9764.81s -> 9800.17s]  bloodlust on the greater basilisks. Surround! You're pretty beefy. One left. Can I do like
[9800.17s -> 9806.22s]  a magic arrow? Fuck. No bloodlust. Looks like you're just gonna have to hang out over here.
[9810.57s -> 9823.66s]  No! Damn it! Come on. One fucking left. You retreat with one person left?
[9824.30s -> 9831.10s]  That's so infuriating. I think you shouldn't be able to retreat if you've been in the match for
[9831.10s -> 9838.86s]  more than like a minute. What the fuck? If you've been fighting for like two minutes,
[9838.86s -> 9845.58s]  I think you retreat is not an option. You could go with one person left and you can run away
[9845.58s -> 9852.58s]  and keep all your stuff. Uh-uh. Come on. The game's 20 years old. I know. I know,
[9852.58s -> 9865.03s]  but I'm fucking mad. That's pretty good. I'm gonna get that. No, this is mine now.
[9870.60s -> 9876.94s]  That's all you got left is this. You don't have anything, really. I'm gonna hang out back here.
[9877.74s -> 9891.54s]  No, let me see here. What if you not build? I need this citadel. Capital. But if you come,
[9891.54s -> 9901.53s]  he might come back. What about my original house? You know orange? Okay, orange is now
[9901.53s -> 9905.61s]  retreating this way. I think orange is gonna come try to take my old house
[9906.33s -> 9913.51s]  because I just took his. It's just we're never ending, never ending trade houses with
[9913.51s -> 9927.99s]  each other. He didn't even lead me anything. Maybe just get a level two. No capital. Like,
[9927.99s -> 9938.07s]  I gotta wait. Um, I need to go out and just start taking stuff. So come on out.
[9938.63s -> 9949.46s]  I've got this already. One attack. Yeah, just get out here and get it.
[9950.26s -> 9962.74s]  There's a sanctuary right here. Fucking red. Orange. Green. Plus one attack permanently.
[9963.70s -> 9982.01s]  That's too luck. Got a gold mine down here. I still can't afford anything. Retake the old capital?
[9984.52s -> 9993.78s]  Just AFK in the sanctuary forever. I don't think I can do that. Medusas. I'll take them.
[9993.78s -> 9997.06s]  The magic plane. This is also...
[9999.14s -> 10002.49s]  Uh, it's been deserted. This cyclops tower. I want to get this.
[10006.50s -> 10011.22s]  Shit, I want that gold mine. Or should I just... I'm already up here. Hold on.
[10014.90s -> 10031.99s]  War Machine Factory. I already got it. Or this way. Just recruit a thousand chaos hydras. I could.
[10032.79s -> 10040.36s]  Observatory. Let's get a good look. So this is a lot of orange and then red is up here.
[10041.32s -> 10056.15s]  So I could take this stuff. I want that gold mine. Yeah, let's get the gold mine.
[10061.72s -> 10066.47s]  I don't want to be left out in the open here. I'm gonna grab this too.
[10067.59s -> 10074.71s]  Is anybody else down here? I don't think anyone else is over here.
[10077.11s -> 10079.91s]  New capital! Welcome to the new capital!
[10083.61s -> 10094.17s]  4,000 gold a day. It's like we never left. I'm leaving the town undefended.
[10094.89s -> 10097.77s]  Yeah, the town is really undefended, but there's nobody really up here.
[10098.33s -> 10104.04s]  It would take at least like three or four days for someone to even get over here.
[10104.76s -> 10108.20s]  They're all down here. They're all fucking each other up down there.
[10108.92s -> 10117.48s]  All right, here we go. We got some population now.
[10119.64s -> 10126.18s]  You are here. He's down here. Good. I hope you go down there and fucking have a problem
[10126.18s -> 10137.35s]  with Tan. Because I'm going to take you over here. I'm not going to be that
[10137.35s -> 10143.96s]  zealous. I'm just going to get this on the way back. Can I get under here?
[10144.84s -> 10160.68s]  I can get this too. I have one zombie garrison. Yeah, this. Now I'm going to head back.
[10162.28s -> 10166.50s]  I could take that stuff too. Let's just head back. I'm going to the sanctuary.
[10167.22s -> 10175.26s]  Chaos hydras. All right, thankfully this guy had everything equipped. Everything was done.
[10175.90s -> 10186.36s]  So let's get on. Let's buy some stuff. He doesn't have the lizard warriors though.
[10187.16s -> 10197.32s]  He does. Hold on. Yeah, he does. Okay. Okay, let's head back there and try to stock up.
[10197.32s -> 10217.59s]  Is he playing with one hero? Well, the problem is I'm trying to get like enough of an army
[10217.59s -> 10225.51s]  where I can have a second hero that is safe. So everyone has so much better stuff than I do.
[10226.31s -> 10232.07s]  So if I make a new hero right now, right, then I'm going to be thin. And if I get attacked,
[10232.95s -> 10242.94s]  then it's all dead. That just happened. I was trying to build a second army to take another
[10242.94s -> 10249.10s]  person out, but I keep getting just so far behind because they end up getting over here
[10249.10s -> 10258.42s]  much quicker than I can. So I can get another hero here, but I'm going to have like not a
[10258.42s -> 10264.54s]  whole lot of stuff. And I just lost my capital, so it's even harder to keep more
[10264.54s -> 10287.67s]  than one person. Can I go ahead and snipe these? I can. All right, next day. All right,
[10287.67s -> 10300.33s]  Tan just killed somebody. Tan just killed Orange's, I think Orange's last defense.
[10303.99s -> 10316.20s]  That's not good. Tan becoming super power. All right, let's take this and then get the
[10316.20s -> 10328.65s]  fuck out of here. I have almost this whole upper quadrant here completed. Okay, give me a
[10328.65s -> 10346.01s]  tavern. Demaniac. Demaniac. I mean, imps or intelligence. I feel like I'd want this.
[10346.97s -> 10381.70s]  It's got like imps. No, I'm going with Andra. Take you out and go exploring because I can't
[10381.70s -> 10396.14s]  really wait around. I can head this way. Stack? No, if I stack, I can only stack on like one
[10396.14s -> 10401.50s]  person. If I play as one person, I'm too concentrated. If I'm not concentrated,
[10402.38s -> 10407.35s]  you know, I have to try to do like two heroes. I can't just like stuff somebody in here and
[10407.35s -> 10416.01s]  stack forever. I could try to get the old castle, but look at this. This guy, this dude is,
[10416.81s -> 10422.95s]  this dude's ready to rock. I was thinking about going for whatever Orange, this is Orange's
[10422.95s -> 10430.41s]  castle. This is Orange's final castle. I might just go try to get it because that,
[10430.41s -> 10438.70s]  this is Orange just got killed by Tan. Remember, I might go try to get the other
[10438.70s -> 10449.46s]  castle from Orange. Let me see. I've got enough. It's worth a try, I think. Let's save it
[10450.26s -> 10477.32s]  because he just got wiped out. Is it worth a shot? Yeah, let's go. I'm going for it.
[10477.32s -> 10481.48s]  You did the thing that I did. Are you sure this is not me playing in a different timeline?
[10494.07s -> 10502.31s]  All right, I need to take a look. What do you have over here? I can't see. I can't see
[10502.31s -> 10509.85s]  what you have. All right, you looking all right. I'll take you out in a minute.
[10510.41s -> 10525.62s]  Let's just hope you don't come attack me and kill me. There he is. Okay. I thought that
[10525.62s -> 10531.27s]  was another person. Hold on. Who's in there? I just want to see what's in there.
[10533.40s -> 10543.64s]  Lots pack, several throng, lots, lots. I can get it. You don't have any big units. I do.
[10544.20s -> 10551.43s]  I'm about to destroy, I'm about to wipe out Orange. Orange's gonna be out of the game.
[10551.43s -> 10561.78s]  You just killed my hydras. All right. They don't have any big units. They don't have
[10561.78s -> 10575.27s]  any. They just have naga queens. Earthquake. Fuck. I don't have any spell points. No.
[10575.99s -> 10589.50s]  Okay. Fireball. I had to rest. Yeah, but I had to like go all the way back and then all the
[10589.50s -> 10598.15s]  way back down here. I don't have any MP, you know. I can icebolt like the naga queens.
[10598.87s -> 10611.32s]  That's all I can do. Or bloodlust somebody. I get bloodlust. They don't really have like
[10611.32s -> 10619.29s]  much of a defense though. Bloodlust the bulls. Bloodlust the wyverns. I would probably bloodlust
[10619.29s -> 10629.43s]  the wyverns and just get them in there. Or the basilisks. The rangers. Doesn't it only
[10629.43s -> 10635.75s]  work on, it's only melee, right? Didn't we find that out before? Hand to hand damage, yeah.
[10636.55s -> 10646.04s]  I'm gonna do it on the wyvern and then I'm just gonna fly like almost in there.
[10647.00s -> 10653.00s]  Maybe I shouldn't do it yet. I'm not gonna do it yet. I'm gonna do it like when
[10653.00s -> 10672.50s]  I'm about to attack somebody. Okay. Just start moving. Get over here. I'm so fucked.
[10679.05s -> 10690.92s]  I'm just aiming at him and shoot him. I gotta get rid of the ones that have range. You need to die.
[10704.46s -> 10708.94s]  I'm in trouble. I have better units but they can't get in because I don't have any mana.
[10709.66s -> 10715.13s]  So we might have to go back to timeline two here unless I can fly in here and just
[10715.13s -> 10725.03s]  cause a fucking problem. I can't, I don't have any mana to use spells. Like I have 12 points.
[10725.03s -> 10735.29s]  I can't use these. Yeah, I'm safe scum in this. I'm gonna save scum. It's not worth it.
[10737.05s -> 10751.91s]  I might eventually get in there but it's not worth it. And I can get some more heroes too.
[10752.55s -> 10758.76s]  And then I'll make my way over to orange. Hopefully I don't get attacked by them.
[10759.40s -> 10767.80s]  Remember when you said, he's coming in right now. He's fucking right here, isn't he?
[10768.60s -> 10781.74s]  Where is he? I just like saw his unit. All right, give me my spell power and I'm going to wipe out.
[10786.42s -> 10792.20s]  I'm not sure it's worth taking these and then I could buy more.
[10796.95s -> 10807.11s]  All right, back to, this guy doesn't have anything. 10 push-ups for every reload.
[10810.62s -> 10823.67s]  All right, how much mana do I have? I have 12 out of 100. Isn't there a way I can
[10824.31s -> 10835.37s]  one of the spells kept within? How do I, isn't there a way I can replenish them?
[10836.09s -> 10854.55s]  Let me just do this because it's there. I gotta get him out. Is that auto? Who's barking?
[10855.51s -> 10861.45s]  Who's barking? Let me see who's barking. I'll be right back.
[10861.45s -> 10864.49s]  I want to go see, seems like somebody's in the door or something.
[10864.49s -> 10868.31s]  I haven't taken a break yet anyway so let me see what's going on. I'll be right back.
[10869.03s -> 10989.00s]  Okay, we're good. We're good. This is really good music, you're right. It's very good.
[10990.23s -> 10999.91s]  Okay, so you go into town because you need to be like in the town inside and then you go and
[10999.91s -> 11008.79s]  visit the town. All right, everyone's comfortable. Everyone's good. Spend a night and then it's
[11008.79s -> 11021.13s]  time to go take over orange. Orange, in fact, is leaving. I don't, I think orange is now
[11021.13s -> 11032.12s]  unguarded. This is going to be perfect. So now let's go like this. You got everything.
[11032.12s -> 11040.20s]  You got 100 spell points, yep. Come on out of there and let's try to get you some
[11040.20s -> 11048.07s]  people next week. You have to stay in there. You, all right, here we go. Let's save it.
[11049.03s -> 11067.51s]  That's not a save. That is. This is still timeline two. I'm ready. How do I get over here
[11067.51s -> 11077.06s]  without him? Hopefully he doesn't see me. Although I could send the other guy out to
[11077.06s -> 11080.34s]  take this stuff back but I feel like I'll just get killed. Somebody will attack me
[11080.34s -> 11098.84s]  if it has more stuff. He's down here. He's gonna get implemented straight up. It's gonna
[11098.84s -> 11111.40s]  take him a while. It'll take him a while. Now he's coming back down. Tan just has so much.
[11114.38s -> 11124.15s]  Tan has a fucking ton of stuff. He's got like three heroes. Me and orange have one. I think
[11124.15s -> 11133.32s]  red only has one or two. Okay, well we got some dwellings. I have money so let's just at
[11133.32s -> 11148.68s]  least make, let's start a secondary unit here. Okay, wear the gold mine back. I think I can get
[11148.68s -> 11155.30s]  this uncontested and then he's fucked. Yep, I think he's gonna have to backtrack and come get
[11155.30s -> 11180.65s]  me. Should I? No. Should I leave everybody in the garrison? He won't be able to get through but
[11182.65s -> 11192.57s]  no. I don't know if that's a good idea. Just scum it. It might work. Let's see. Okay,
[11192.57s -> 11204.55s]  let's see if I, let's see what timeline happens when I don't do that. He's coming up. Time to
[11204.55s -> 11214.30s]  change capitals again. He's coming up for this one. He might not. If I can have two castles,
[11214.30s -> 11222.38s]  I'll be fucking happy. You ain't got nobody in there, man. There's like not very many people
[11222.38s -> 11240.33s]  in there. Give it to me. Here we go. Earthquake. Boom. I'm flying in. Should I not?
[11240.33s -> 11248.89s]  How many do I have? 19? No, don't fly in. I only have one range unit. I'm gonna get closer,
[11248.89s -> 11262.66s]  though. I'm gonna get closer up this way. You get closer down here. Cast any dumb spells.
[11262.66s -> 11266.10s]  That's fine. I'm gonna retaliate. Now you just killed, you just absolutely killed yourself.
[11267.22s -> 11275.96s]  So far so good. Let's get closer. We're gonna, I want to get, keep everybody like near the
[11275.96s -> 11300.66s]  front door because it's gonna open. Dead? All right, earthquake. Who needs a heal?
[11301.54s -> 11312.82s]  Don't do it. What are you doing? He's like, I think I'm gonna open the door. Do you see
[11312.82s -> 11329.37s]  them? I don't think I can see them over this height. I'm gonna, not yet. If he opens the
[11329.37s -> 11337.85s]  door, I'm not even gonna send them in. No, just wait. I think I'm just gonna wait. If
[11337.85s -> 11341.53s]  he opens the door, just come on out. Whatever. There's nobody, nobody else has range.
[11342.41s -> 11360.82s]  Oh, I can go in here. You can get in. I didn't even see that. Hey, anybody out here?
[11366.50s -> 11380.76s]  Fucking idiot. All right, I'm taking this pretty uncontested. It's fairly uncontested. I'm okay
[11380.76s -> 11393.10s]  with this. Anybody hear a noise? Well, now I can go in front door. I'm sitting on the gate.
[11393.90s -> 11409.56s]  All right, it's time. Flying. Everybody go in. Now we just have some skeletons.
[11412.68s -> 11418.84s]  Uh, yeah, now I killed the skeletons. Orange is about to be in very, very bad place.
[11419.72s -> 11429.14s]  Defeated. Tons of experience. I only lost some archers and one. Yeah, I didn't lose very much.
[11430.57s -> 11440.26s]  Basic ballistics for expert first aid. I feel like I want to like take expert first
[11440.26s -> 11453.48s]  aid just to get it out of here. It's been something to pick. I feel like we can get
[11453.48s -> 11467.93s]  better options. So this is what Orange has left. What does your house look like?
[11468.73s -> 11479.21s]  It's pretty stacked, actually. Yeah, it's stacked. Wall of knowledge. Yeah.
[11482.20s -> 11486.84s]  Oh, look at this. He's got fucking units to spend. All right, now we can make another hero
[11486.84s -> 11493.03s]  and I can actually have them with a good army. I've got another castle.
[11494.18s -> 11509.54s]  It's protected. Just get in here. Get inside the castle. I also have this, which is starting
[11509.54s -> 11515.62s]  to be, I'm having a little bit of trouble, but I've got a okay defense here. Not good,
[11515.62s -> 11522.90s]  not great, not fantastic, bad, not good at all. And here he comes, but it's not that good.
[11524.15s -> 11533.03s]  It's good. It's good enough. He's got lots of like fucking bone dragon things. I just,
[11533.03s -> 11539.40s]  I need him to turn around or I need him to go like somewhere else. Orange is right here.
[11539.40s -> 11549.94s]  Please go fight Orange and kill him. And, but I could go kill him. No, he needs to go here.
[11549.94s -> 11558.34s]  They need to fight. Now I can start to claim this shit. Wait, do I have any
[11558.58s -> 11574.94s]  walking points left? Um, not enough to do that. Not enough. Okay, here we go. Don't come get me.
[11577.35s -> 11608.26s]  Oh, where's it going? Orange. Okay. Give me this. Give me this. Give me that. I need more money.
[11608.90s -> 11634.09s]  I got, how many marketplaces do I have? I've got tons of wood too. I need more shit. I do.
[11634.09s -> 11651.10s]  I have to. I'm going to do 150 of these and then like a hundred of these, 160, 180. I need units.
[11651.10s -> 11659.26s]  I just need more. And then I'm going to have a hero there too. All right. So I need, I just need
[11659.26s -> 11666.92s]  units. Bang. This is a, this is a decent army. Okay. This is a good, this is a decent fucking
[11666.92s -> 11692.97s]  army to defend this house. It's not great, but it's not terrible. I wish I had teleport.
[11692.97s -> 11701.18s]  God damn, I wish I had teleport. So bad. If only I had teleport. Imagine if I had teleport.
[11701.18s -> 11715.35s]  I could get one, two. I could get them all. It's up and to the right. Okay. Where am I at?
[11715.99s -> 11726.42s]  I want to get, I could kill him. I think I'm going to go to, I think I'm going to go for it.
[11727.14s -> 11734.06s]  He's got nowhere to retreat to. I'm going to think I'm going to kill him. I'll get his
[11734.06s -> 11753.61s]  artifacts. And Orange is dead. How far away is Tan? Tan's right here. All right. I'm going to,
[11753.61s -> 11757.93s]  I'm going to sit in my hole. He might, they might actually, they might fight. I'm hiding.
[11761.80s -> 11774.42s]  It's time to hide with my two castles and my two armies. Tan claiming Tan. Orange is coming
[11774.42s -> 11793.66s]  back here. Orange is on the way back here. He has to claim a castle. He's done. Remember,
[11793.66s -> 11806.84s]  he only has a few days left. Anything else I can do up here? I want to save the money.
[11807.48s -> 11815.51s]  I mean, okay. Here's a game plan. I could send you out and then make a new hero and start
[11815.51s -> 11834.70s]  stacking. I think that is a ding. No. Bad plan. Do you think that's a good plan? I already
[11834.70s -> 11846.38s]  have a new, I already have a capital. I could get, how many Titans could I get? One. I
[11846.46s -> 11856.89s]  could get one super Titan and replace the Medusa. I need to restart my computer.
[11860.50s -> 11875.10s]  Have the other guys stack units of the other. Should I save the game? This is, I'll tell you,
[11875.90s -> 11881.34s]  this is crucial because I'm in a spot right now where I can start to stockpile minions and I
[11881.34s -> 11888.34s]  can eliminate another player. And then again, the week goes by and I've got like a couple of
[11888.42s -> 11897.70s]  really decent sized armies. This is crucial that this decision is done correctly. I have to go,
[11899.00s -> 11903.16s]  I have to go this way and start to claim territories that Tan has over here.
[11908.52s -> 11914.20s]  Once Orange is done, I need to go this way and I actually, I have to start going over here.
[11916.89s -> 11920.65s]  There's no way I'm going to be able to take over Tan. Not right now. I need a few more
[11920.65s -> 11927.26s]  castles and I needed a little bit more of a minion stash. This is crucial. Let's go.
[11935.83s -> 11939.59s]  This is his last ditch effort. I'm going to get his artifacts. It's over. He loses.
[11940.39s -> 11952.54s]  What does he have? Queens. Let's get a little bit of ranged. I'm going to, let's see, Fireball or
[11953.58s -> 11966.34s]  I'm going to get rid of the ranged so we can do right here or right here. I can do right
[11966.34s -> 11978.18s]  there. That'll take out probably most of the stuff over this way. Do Earthquake on my own
[11978.18s -> 11990.74s]  house. That would be so, no, I'm not going to do Earthquake. I could do slow. Always slow.
[11991.54s -> 12007.45s]  Reduce the speed of all enemy units. Okay. I'm going to stick around. Just going to wait.
[12008.33s -> 12014.30s]  Nobody move. I have some range. Let them come to you. Nobody move. Nobody do anything.
[12015.34s -> 12031.77s]  Take out the wizard. Let them explode. We get to go twice. That's fine.
[12034.82s -> 12045.75s]  One queen is perished. Jewel Wizardry. It really is Jewel Wizardry. All right, who am I?
[12048.52s -> 12059.11s]  Jewel Wizardry! I can do that every time. Ten gargoyles perish. Thank god you're stupid.
[12060.73s -> 12066.42s]  Um, all right, just don't do anything. Don't move. Nobody move. They have to come to you.
[12068.94s -> 12085.88s]  No! They got the bottom down. That was a mistake. Seven genies dead. What? What are you thinking?
[12087.22s -> 12109.16s]  What the fuck even are you thinking? Six genies dead. I get to go again. Let's make it a
[12109.16s -> 12118.60s]  double. Minimal damage. Minimal. Minimal. Okay, looking good. He's through. That's fine. He's
[12118.60s -> 12139.51s]  dead. Are they? Did he? How did he? Oh, he flew. Okay. Twice. Nice. He's fucked. I wonder if
[12139.51s -> 12148.23s]  you're going to step on a landmine. What do you think? Rush him? No, not yet. Not yet.
[12148.23s -> 12155.86s]  Not until these guys are dead. If I can not take any damage from like any of these people,
[12155.86s -> 12169.94s]  that would be so happy. See, look. He's just like, duck. What the fuck are you doing?
[12174.06s -> 12187.48s]  Why would you do that? That was just BM. It was. He knew he was going to lose.
[12194.90s -> 12198.02s]  Don't let him come in. Who cares? They're not going to get in.
[12198.74s -> 12209.14s]  Let's go for the front, I guess. Why not? I'm actually not going for the majors.
[12209.70s -> 12218.86s]  He's to go all the way down. Oh no. Oh no. You punched me a couple times.
[12220.42s -> 12241.54s]  I'm scared. I'm scared. Give me all your stuff.
[12246.84s -> 12260.90s]  I'm scared. Don't shiver. Hold on. This item renders your
[12260.90s -> 12268.54s]  units immune to the curse spell. That's pretty great. One on the torso of this
[12268.54s -> 12273.62s]  item increases your power by plus two and the Crest of Valor increases your morale by plus one.
[12274.58s -> 12279.66s]  Advanced ballistics. Hey guys, I'm going to have low energy.
[12283.14s -> 12304.41s]  Yeah. Look at that. No! Fuck out of my way.
[12304.41s -> 12308.65s]  I did that. I vanquished the enemy. These streams are really weird.
[12316.63s -> 12324.22s]  Don't fake cry. That made me sad. Why? Because I systematically destroyed him.
[12324.22s -> 12331.46s]  I meticulously destroyed him. I was the one that killed Orange. Nobody else did anything
[12331.46s -> 12336.82s]  to him. I took out his ground units. I took out his cemented into the ground units,
[12336.82s -> 12342.14s]  which are castles. He had no chance. I'm okay with this.
[12342.70s -> 12358.10s]  Let me make sure I have all this stuff equipped. I do, right? Power's pretty good.
[12362.73s -> 12369.16s]  You going? I just hurt myself. I just like, I can't even describe what I just did. I just
[12369.16s -> 12377.11s]  closed my legs tightly around and I spun around and that hurt a lot. All right. We're
[12377.11s -> 12385.03s]  almost at a new week. I've got time now. I have enough time to send
[12386.23s -> 12396.34s]  you packing. Out here. I'm going to go up to red. I'm going to try to find my way this way.
[12396.98s -> 12399.14s]  I'm not going to leave this place empty handed because I'm going to make another
[12399.14s -> 12410.01s]  hero and I'm going to make this castle defending. Check it out. All right. Which
[12410.01s -> 12416.42s]  like YouTube thumbnail am I going to use? Which YouTuber click this video thumbnail?
[12416.42s -> 12440.30s]  They're both equally. There's level four barbarian specialty in ogres. Yeah. All
[12440.30s -> 12450.06s]  right. Should I be the YouTuber? Put my face on every thumbnail or every iPad game
[12450.62s -> 12454.73s]  that has released in the last three years. This is an important decision.
[12461.10s -> 12470.15s]  I think we have to do with the YouTube. Yeah. Well, I got to, I got to move on out.
[12470.79s -> 12478.47s]  I got to like move this person out of the way. He's level four too. I mean,
[12478.47s -> 12488.82s]  I have to look for bingo. All right. Let's get you some people. How about some titans?
[12489.46s -> 12495.13s]  We're going to build you up. I'm going to take this person out of here. All right.
[12495.13s -> 12500.41s]  Everything's just fine. We're starting to become a power. Tan is looking very strong.
[12501.05s -> 12508.54s]  Red's looking a little on the weak side. I think I'm going to take you.
[12509.26s -> 12519.46s]  You need, Oh, you're in town. You know what? What? Everything's claimed. I'm going to leave
[12519.46s -> 12527.38s]  that castle protected. Come over here. Get this mine in here. He's fucking diluted.
[12532.94s -> 12537.02s]  Hey, I'm, I'm making it to like the final three. I'm okay with that. Tan is a lot
[12537.02s -> 12542.46s]  of stuff, but if I can, if Dan, if tan does not end up coming up here immediately,
[12543.02s -> 12551.80s]  it's going to be hard for him to take this castle. I wonder if I should just
[12551.80s -> 12557.99s]  fuck it and just start moving. I'm going to have to move. I'm going to get this.
[12557.99s -> 12569.02s]  And I mean, that's just money. I need it. Tan's got everything. This is going to be,
[12569.02s -> 12573.50s]  this is going to be all reds. Red's gone. Orange gone. Red gone. I think,
[12573.50s -> 12594.23s]  I don't know who's left. It's just gray, green and tan. I think, no, it is just me.
[12595.21s -> 12611.70s]  Oh fuck. It's just me versus tan. No, no. Is it really me and tan? No, no, no.
[12611.70s -> 12629.02s]  This is still pink. Red, dead, tan. Pink was the first to die. Well, yeah, pink died in the very
[12629.02s -> 12640.79s]  beginning. Is it just me and tan? Did blue die? We're going to have to investigate over here.
[12641.43s -> 12648.39s]  It's investigation time. We need, I need to go this way. There's somebody in here.
[12650.60s -> 12665.66s]  Yeah, we've got to, it's, I'm investigating. Tan's coming up. Is there nobody left? Well,
[12665.66s -> 12676.62s]  get this back. Get the thousand experience. Let's break through this and go on the road.
[12684.66s -> 12704.54s]  Not a new week yet. No, what do we need? I need genies. Okay. I'm so, I'm really,
[12704.54s -> 12712.04s]  really confused about this. Let's see. Tan's got this all under control. Here he comes.
[12713.48s -> 12723.67s]  He's on this road down here. He's going to go this way. All right. Find out what's over
[12723.67s -> 12739.38s]  here. Anybody else in the chat smoke weed? All right. Well, I just killed that guy in a second.
[12740.02s -> 12763.22s]  What's over here? Nothing. It's not a road. Dwarf college. Where's he heading? No, I don't
[12763.22s -> 12767.61s]  know. He's freaking me out. They just met in the middle there. He's coming. No, he went
[12767.61s -> 12777.21s]  down again. I don't want any dwarfs. No. What the fuck is that? I've made it across.
[12777.21s -> 12835.77s]  Homestead archers. No, this is all tan left. He's here. He won't make it. Get it. One hit.
[12835.77s -> 12855.53s]  Nice. Okay. So now we've got a bubbling cauldron. Where am I? Where's tan on this road?
[12855.53s -> 12867.43s]  No, not yet. All right. We've got more defense here. More of these stacking up some units.
[12869.98s -> 12873.66s]  This one's the one that's in most danger. I think they're ignoring it over here.
[12880.81s -> 12892.68s]  Tan? He's going down to get elementals. A thousand experience. Give me it. Fountain of Youth.
[12893.32s -> 12908.79s]  Well, I can't tell what's up there. I'm going back to the road. Oh, what's this? Mage tower.
[12911.62s -> 12934.06s]  It's mage's uncharted territory. I need to save. No, I have to. More of these wyverns.
[12936.15s -> 12946.15s]  More donkeys. Archers. I'm fucking nervous right now. He's got two really, really stacked
[12946.15s -> 12958.73s]  heroes. He might even have three. Enchanted Spring. Water wheel. Enchanted Spring. Pegasi.
[12958.73s -> 12982.60s]  I don't want Pegasi. Sanctuary. Fuck. You don't have a castle over here? You got this one.
[12983.32s -> 12991.27s]  You've got to have a castle back here. Stuffed back here. You have to. Get in the sanctuary.
[12992.15s -> 12999.21s]  There's got to be a castle back there. There has to be a stuffed crust castle back there.
[12999.21s -> 13010.52s]  Oh, don't say that. I can't eat that. I can't eat any food for like the next
[13011.24s -> 13028.57s]  two or three days. This is pretty barren here. I have titans. He's coming up. No,
[13028.57s -> 13033.13s]  he's just claiming every resource. He has so much money. He's got so many resources.
[13033.13s -> 13040.65s]  I'm fucking... Look at this. He's got the whole map. It's just me and Tan. It has to be.
[13047.18s -> 13052.02s]  I've got to snipe some of these resources from him. It's so far away.
[13052.66s -> 13078.74s]  That's plus one attack. I've got all I can buy. I've got to go back to the other place.
[13079.54s -> 13087.48s]  I'm okay with this defense. I can't do any more titans. I can do naga queens. I can do one.
[13087.48s -> 13098.60s]  This is it. He's coming in for the kill. He's coming in for the kill shot right now.
[13100.39s -> 13103.91s]  There better be something right at the end of this road. He's coming in for the kill shot.
[13103.91s -> 13112.07s]  He's right here. Let's just check. Let's see what's at the end of the road.
[13130.42s -> 13145.83s]  Fuck. It's right here. I'm gonna get it. That would have been too far away. I think we abandoned
[13145.83s -> 13155.00s]  this castle, I think. I'm gonna get another titan. Do I abandon the castle? Should I
[13155.00s -> 13160.22s]  hide over here and then run away? I could take all these units out of here and run the fuck
[13160.22s -> 13202.22s]  away. What do I got for resources? It's time to kneel. I'm not kneeling. I don't kneel for
[13202.22s -> 13222.82s]  kings I don't believe in. I got 10,000. I can get two more titans. I think I'm gonna get them
[13222.82s -> 13229.96s]  out of here. I'm gonna have like somebody sneak out the back. Eight titans. Those are very
[13229.96s -> 13245.70s]  damaging. Look at this. They're fucking 40 to 60 damage ranged. Stay in the fort. Just stay
[13245.70s -> 13260.18s]  in here. Do not sneak out the back. Make him pay in blood. You think I can win with eight
[13260.18s -> 13267.30s]  titans just throwing lightning bolts? I don't know if I can do that. I think I take... Here's
[13267.30s -> 13275.11s]  my plan, okay? Let me tell you my plan. I think I take the titans and I fucking run them away.
[13275.83s -> 13280.34s]  This is like $80,000 worth of stuff. I'm gonna run them. I'm getting out.
[13280.98s -> 13290.18s]  I can get out of here. You're gonna give them the titans? No, no. Let me just...
[13290.18s -> 13300.22s]  Just hear me out on this. Just wait. He's right there. Fuck. If he was like over here,
[13300.22s -> 13311.98s]  I would have just like ran through the gate. Oh well. Just gonna defend. I might actually
[13311.98s -> 13319.72s]  sell some resources to get some more mages. He's coming with like a gigantic fucking force too.
[13319.72s -> 13349.67s]  This is so bad. Does this guy have anything like leveled up? I can get some of them.
[13350.79s -> 13361.29s]  Well, at least I have more range. Okay. Save the game. This is timeline two. We're just
[13361.29s -> 13368.17s]  still in it. I'm about to go up to his castle up here. Maybe he sees, maybe he can
[13368.17s -> 13371.37s]  see that. And he's like, wait a minute. That's not a good idea. And he pulls back.
[13379.91s -> 13387.14s]  Split up the titans. Should I do like two, four, six, eight? Should I do or like four and four?
[13387.14s -> 13402.07s]  Two, four, six, eight? No. Keep them together. No, no. Okay. All right. I'm just thinking
[13402.07s -> 13406.49s]  maybe that would be an interesting thing to do. I could send out like an envoy to meet
[13406.49s -> 13424.01s]  him with like four fucking orcs. Let him come. This is it. He fucking ran away. He ran away.
[13424.01s -> 13432.90s]  He didn't fight me. And now I'm going to get his castle. Oh, you have a lot of people in here.
[13434.01s -> 13441.29s]  You've got a few, a horde, lots of throng, lots of throng. This ain't going to happen.
[13449.06s -> 13482.33s]  Okay. Earthquake. Here we go. Catapult. Catapult right here. Right there. And that's not
[13482.33s -> 13493.74s]  where I aimed. All right. I got to play this smart. I aimed like right here. Why did they go down
[13493.74s -> 13508.98s]  here? Chaos hydras. I'm going in. I just have to go in and try. Oh, it can miss.
[13510.92s -> 13514.28s]  Everybody just has to try to get in here and kill the hydra as fast as possible. And then
[13514.28s -> 13531.42s]  everything else should not be too horrible. Poison. I had to try. I gotta, I have to
[13531.42s -> 13540.81s]  get the fuck in here. Uh, what's more favorable? Probably versus the fireflies.
[13544.46s -> 13565.43s]  Archers. I can't really get over there. I could fly over here. Just like wait. Good.
[13571.24s -> 13589.26s]  They go away. I'm going to, I'm going to keep aiming it down here. The bull. I mean, I'm
[13589.26s -> 13605.45s]  just going to try to get the bottom. If I go for here, the fucking hydra. 250.
[13613.94s -> 13630.41s]  Get to go again. Take another one down. Open the front door. What are you thinking? Oh my
[13630.41s -> 13637.24s]  God. That's so good. Come on. If I get this castle, I'm back in the game for real. And it's
[13637.24s -> 13640.92s]  done very, it's very possible. All right. I can do earthquake again, or I can do something else.
[13641.72s -> 13655.37s]  But before I do earthquake, let me see if this breaks. If this breaks, then I don't need to do
[13655.37s -> 13669.58s]  earthquake. Don't need to do earthquake. I'm in. Now I'm going to do something else. I'm
[13669.58s -> 13678.38s]  going to do either fireball or lightning bolt. Fireball on. Now it hits me too. Doesn't
[13678.38s -> 13687.54s]  it? What we can do. We have expert, right? Expert stone skin. That's not a good, that's
[13687.54s -> 13699.61s]  not a bad idea. Do I have it though? Let's do it. All right. Continue to destroy. I want you
[13700.41s -> 13713.66s]  archers. The bulls. Holy fucking hell. The bulls. The bulls. The bulls. I'm going to,
[13713.66s -> 13733.13s]  I'm going to get it. I'm going to get this. It's so powerful. They're so powerful.
[13735.54s -> 13745.40s]  They're like too powerful. Let's keep killing these guys down. Heal bulls.
[13754.92s -> 13774.74s]  That's good. Noel's dead. That's it.
[13777.99s -> 13792.84s]  I got way more than you. This is a victory. I'm going to lose the archer's butt.
[13793.00s -> 13805.58s]  It's okay. The bull might be the best unit that I have. I'm just going to stack them forever.
[13806.46s -> 13817.80s]  Can I? Really? I can hit that guy? I can't. Oh, you can. That's funny. All right. Get in
[13817.80s -> 13842.34s]  here. Ow. These ones are still up here. No, sorry. Just wait. Get the bulls in here.
[13843.38s -> 13846.82s]  What the hell? No. What the fuck is going on? I can't believe it. I knew that was
[13847.78s -> 13852.82s]  going to happen. Don't worry. Oh, I hate this game. I tried to click them. The game's fun.
[13853.62s -> 13878.06s]  I just took his capital. Normal maximum spell points by 50%. That's insane. Or expert ballistics.
[13880.70s -> 13885.18s]  Two aim shots at maximum damage. Either one of these is really, really good.
[13885.82s -> 13909.00s]  Here's the capital. I need bulls. All right. What do you got? You've already cleaned yourself
[13909.00s -> 13913.24s]  out completely here. I mean, I can get all of these. Might as well just because I'm running
[13913.24s -> 13923.42s]  out of people. Don't have an artifact. I got to make an artifact merchant. So I got three
[13923.42s -> 13930.70s]  cities. And now that I have this, I can start to move around a little bit. Is it really just
[13930.70s -> 13940.74s]  me and Tan? I'm so fucked. This is not a bad force. I got to come out and start claiming
[13940.74s -> 13950.39s]  stuff. I can come out. This person's not scary at all. You know what I mean? Like, I think
[13950.95s -> 13963.54s]  I'm pretty sure I can take that person. What do you got? This is the one that has the power.
[13965.16s -> 13971.42s]  He has the swarm of the pixies. He has the highest unit. I think he has three heroes.
[13972.06s -> 13978.86s]  I could snipe some more of these castles. That's exactly what I'm going to fucking do.
[13979.50s -> 13985.96s]  Not that one. I'm going to go down here. See, there we go. Right here. You've got like a
[13985.96s -> 14015.13s]  pack. That would be a fight. Here comes a new week. Chaos hydrants. Bulls. Get them all.
[14016.01s -> 14025.38s]  This is turning out to be a pretty good army. All right. I need to leave here and
[14025.38s -> 14038.15s]  start claiming. I got to start picking stuff up. You know, I got to start to tap into
[14038.15s -> 14041.99s]  his resources. At least come out and grab some of the stuff that he took before.
[14054.06s -> 14063.13s]  Yeah, I lost my swamp. I could start to come out and go on the open field here.
[14063.13s -> 14070.42s]  I have pretty decent army. Who is this guy? This guy that just came in the front door. Who
[14070.42s -> 14088.34s]  are you? Several. Horde. Several. This is going to be a fight. I got fucking six chaos dragons.
[14093.58s -> 14113.46s]  I can repel them. Ten, eighteen, fifty, four, six. I could sell resources, but I don't
[14113.46s -> 14118.97s]  know if he's going to come do it. Several means, what, five to ten? Or is it ten to
[14118.97s -> 14133.27s]  twenty? A few is like up to five, right? Up to ten. Five to nine. It's going to be a fight,
[14133.27s -> 14142.58s]  but I have it. I think I might, I'll be able to do it. Oh fuck. They're closing in. Hold on a
[14142.58s -> 14149.46s]  minute here. What do I got in here? I think I, I got eight titans. I think I meet them in
[14149.46s -> 14166.20s]  the open field. I think I can do it. Two more titans. I got to load that guy up with titans.
[14169.45s -> 14175.96s]  All right. I'm going to start to claim. I got to start to move around. I haven't been down
[14175.96s -> 14185.61s]  here. There might be another castle. It might not even be fortified. Well, time to save. This is
[14185.61s -> 14198.06s]  where we find out what might happen here. Let's see what happens. No, he's not coming.
[14198.78s -> 14215.59s]  He just wants the resources. Ice bolt, ice bolt, ice bolt, ice bolt, ice bolt. You don't
[14215.59s -> 14226.44s]  have ice bolt. How do you not have ice bolt? Ice bolt on the bird. Three. Here we go.
[14229.18s -> 14238.95s]  Oh, it's all right. This could happen. They have a lot of ranged. They have a lot of ranged.
[14238.95s -> 14243.19s]  I, do I, do I fly out and fucking attack the genie? I could go fly attack this genie right
[14243.19s -> 14259.77s]  now. All right. I might just focus on the bird. Bird focus. Come on. Ow. Kill bird.
[14260.79s -> 14275.82s]  Kill bird. He's got one left. Kill bird. Kill bird. I have a really good chance now.
[14276.46s -> 14279.82s]  Now everybody just fucking relax and hang out and don't do anything dumb.
[14284.76s -> 14297.54s]  I've got balls. I do. All right. The most important. These guys don't have range. No,
[14297.54s -> 14304.62s]  they do. They do. He split the Titans up. These wizards are the ones that have to die.
[14309.34s -> 14312.46s]  I got to get out there. I got it. I have to get out there. I got to fly out there.
[14312.46s -> 14317.59s]  I got to kill those wizards. I got to get out there now. You know, I got to get,
[14317.59s -> 14333.06s]  I got to get, I got to get out there. 331. Oh my god. All right. I think I, I have to.
[14333.06s -> 14338.68s]  Let me, wait. Lightning bolt. Ice bolt. Ice bolt. Ice or lightning? Versus the wizards.
[14339.32s -> 14350.31s]  Probably lightning. I could blind them too. Cannot move and cause it to counter attack
[14350.31s -> 14358.38s]  at half its normal attack strength. No, that doesn't, he can still attack. No,
[14358.38s -> 14360.22s]  blinding isn't going to work. We're going to do, we're going to zap.
[14360.94s -> 14381.93s]  Oh, I got, do I just fucking go out there?
[14386.71s -> 14391.35s]  I don't know. I think they just have to, just have to wait. Oh, I can hold it or just go in.
[14392.23s -> 14417.22s]  That's the only range they have. I'm going in. Oh, I've got to do this. I have to fly over
[14417.22s -> 14445.11s]  there and kill. I, I, 58. Oh no. It's like, whoa. They have too many units. There's too
[14445.11s -> 14458.73s]  many units. Fucking 400 of these things. Send the balls in. Just somebody kill these.
[14459.53s -> 14465.82s]  The titans can't even move. I'm going out the front door with the balls. Next
[14465.82s -> 14479.56s]  fucking attempt. They're dead. Dead. Come on. Kill them.
[14485.00s -> 14498.54s]  No, you're doing the stupid blessing. Get these pixies out of here. Okay. Should I dispel
[14499.10s -> 14509.00s]  or should I try ice bolt? I can't. I'm going to dispel them. I can't blind them.
[14509.72s -> 14511.40s]  I can't. I don't have enough spell points.
[14511.40s -> 14536.66s]  God damn it. Why was this guy so beefy? That's the only person that's been doing anything.
[14537.30s -> 14552.97s]  It's cause this hero like is level two. They realistically only have this. I still have 18
[14552.97s -> 14567.08s]  balls and I still have chaos fucking demons. I kind of have to just walk out the front door.
[14567.80s -> 14572.50s]  Like that's the sad part of this. I have to get out there. Like just go,
[14573.22s -> 14590.95s]  just go out the front door. Get the balls out there. Hurry.
[14592.33s -> 14602.30s]  All right. He brought the genies in. 18. Three genies die. I have to bring the balls out.
[14602.86s -> 14610.44s]  Or should I just kill the genies? They're just, they're in here. Five genies dead.
[14610.44s -> 14618.02s]  No, they just, they have too many of these guys. They have too many. They had so much
[14618.02s -> 14628.15s]  range. He just brought it. He had like fucking four ranged units. This is it. I lose.
[14628.95s -> 14642.78s]  Well, this person's literally just stepping in the swamp. I should have 2020 hindsight.
[14642.78s -> 14646.54s]  I should have only just, I should have brought everybody outside to attack the mages,
[14646.54s -> 14649.59s]  but then they would have just died. They would have just died.
[14650.47s -> 14660.23s]  Everybody that walked out the door would just die. This is a loss. The balls can't do
[14660.23s -> 14665.58s]  this on their own. I love how the shitty archers on the castle can do more damage than
[14665.58s -> 14679.45s]  like my people can do. Yeah, this is over. They are weakened. Yeah, but I've lost this
[14679.45s -> 14687.10s]  cow. I'm just, this tan owns almost the entire game. I mean, I'm just going to fucking,
[14687.10s -> 14720.38s]  whatever. I'm just going to die here. Well, they ain't going to have much, but at this stage,
[14721.02s -> 14726.54s]  I don't know. I don't think this is winnable. I don't, they have so much beef. They own the
[14726.54s -> 14735.99s]  whole game. I swear to God, if pink is just down here. No, it's all tan. They conquered
[14735.99s -> 14742.55s]  everything. Tan conquered. Okay. This is the stupidest damn thing. Listen to what happened here.
[14743.59s -> 14749.03s]  So one of these, like two or three of these fucking dumb fuck faces in the beginning of the
[14749.03s -> 14754.95s]  game, like pink and blue, whoever it was instantly lost. And I mean like instantly,
[14754.95s -> 14758.87s]  they lost everything. Tan just like walked into somebody's castle and just took it over
[14760.23s -> 14774.41s]  twice. And then so tan at the very beginning of the game had like three castles down here
[14776.57s -> 14781.05s]  and then just started to fucking poison everybody. And then I made it to the finals too. I'm okay
[14781.05s -> 14791.62s]  with this. Who's even in here? What's down here? I want to see what's down here. Get out of my way.
[14794.34s -> 14808.18s]  It's goddamn tan. Yeah, it's just me and tan. Fucking tan. Unbelievable. I can't believe it.
[14808.18s -> 14816.09s]  They took everything. They have everything. No, I can't lose in a 1v1. Who's in here?
[14823.30s -> 14836.70s]  Where's the ice pole? There's gotta be some castle that's unguarded. How do you have so
[14836.70s -> 14858.52s]  much guard everywhere? Well, I need money to make units. Oh my god. Yeah, from the very
[14858.52s -> 14865.34s]  beginning of the game. This is impossible. There's no, this is an unsurmountable no
[14865.34s -> 14873.30s]  victory would be. I can't do it. Impossible. I have to restart the game. I'm done. There's no
[14873.30s -> 14885.46s]  way. All right, so you know when you play risk and you're on Australia still and one of your
[14885.46s -> 14889.14s]  friends has every single other continent and every single other country in the game and it
[14889.14s -> 14895.22s]  gives you that look like uh what do you want to do here because you have like 200 troops
[14895.22s -> 14901.85s]  right at that bridge. That's just what I'm doing. I'm just pro I'm prolonging the game.
[14910.90s -> 14917.42s]  Hey dude, uh you want to get some like food or something? No, I'm not done playing the
[14917.42s -> 14927.96s]  game. Uh I mean it's impossible for you to win. I'm not done playing. All right um where do you
[14927.96s -> 14942.94s]  want to go? I would like to stay in Australia in fortified please. Okay yeah it is just like
[14944.76s -> 14952.20s]  that is no way. I have to just give up. Go to the tree house. Yeah, I didn't even
[14952.20s -> 14963.75s]  click that. I'm just I'm I'm clicking it. It's like eight heroes. Oh no they're coming from
[14963.75s -> 14982.81s]  my castle. What's wrong? He owns everything. He has like 10 castles. He has every single castle.
[14985.78s -> 14992.76s]  What is this? Oh that's me. That's so funny. I'm I made it to the final two. I'll take second
[14992.76s -> 15006.81s]  place. That's fine. He's just toying with me. Well, I mean I still have like 10. I could
[15006.81s -> 15019.91s]  just put make like 20 fucking titans. It's not over yet. It has not ended. He hasn't taken this
[15019.91s -> 15031.99s]  castle and I could I can make 20 titans. Get out of Australia. Stop it. Get get you're
[15031.99s -> 15036.87s]  not going to win. It I don't care how many troops you have on Australia. Here we go.
[15037.99s -> 15057.96s]  Biggest threat is what the hell is this? They shoot 63 of these fucking things.
[15058.76s -> 15072.36s]  Free to the mages. I think the mage is the worst and the ones that can fly. Oh boy. Okay well
[15072.36s -> 15089.22s]  hold on a minute here. It's not over yet. Just continue. Just buff the titan. Magic arrow
[15089.22s -> 15124.23s]  cure bless. Maximum damage. I haven't lost yet. Give it the titan again. Stay here.
[15125.19s -> 15140.74s]  I get to go again. Oh it's been breached. Okay we have blessing. We're gonna do
[15141.70s -> 15159.37s]  he already still has blessing right? I guess he's blessed right? Just fucking keep doing it. It's
[15159.37s -> 15174.78s]  very I can do this. How many points do I have? 17. I still have plenty. Stone skin on I'm gonna
[15174.78s -> 15185.72s]  say probably on the on the naga queens or just all in on the titan. Probably all in on titan.
[15185.80s -> 15205.34s]  That's what I'm gonna go for. You're in. It's okay. You're in but it don't matter. Now we all have
[15205.34s -> 15216.17s]  to focus on you. No. Get rid of them. Everybody just calm down. Just focus on the dragon that
[15216.17s -> 15234.23s]  just climbed in. Fucking pathetic. Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. 14. Titan come on. Titans
[15234.23s -> 15241.02s]  do it. They're just dying. They're just he's killing himself. I'm gonna hold the castle.
[15242.84s -> 15257.00s]  I'm gonna hold the castle. This is melee right? I'm gonna swing with the sword. That's technically
[15257.00s -> 15276.54s]  melee. Holy shit. I killed so many. It's not over. I'm gonna win. Okay we gotta deal with
[15276.54s -> 15285.74s]  the ball coming in the front door. We got just everybody body block the titan. This is gonna
[15285.74s -> 15291.11s]  be the problem here. They still have. Yeah they have so many strong units.
[15291.99s -> 15306.46s]  Deal with the immediate threat. It's the immediate threat right here. I get to go twice. Die.
[15307.34s -> 15321.93s]  I'm gonna have to go with the titan. We're gonna kill the naga queens. Ow. Um cure or
[15321.93s -> 15341.38s]  bless again. All right here comes the ball. It's just the titan. Go on. Come on. I think
[15341.38s -> 15381.50s]  I can do it. It's possible. Dispel that shit. Cure. Ah. It's still possible. It's still possible.
[15381.50s -> 15391.88s]  They have to get over here. It's possible. Bloodlust again. Do it. Kill them. Okay all
[15391.88s -> 15411.29s]  right. Here we go. I just need. I'm gonna lose. To kill. I have to get rid of the titans.
[15412.52s -> 15419.18s]  Bless. Again. Or should I stone. But stone skin is from melee. Haste.
[15426.65s -> 15433.29s]  Bless and then throw. Haste. Do you want to do haste and then walk over here and smash them.
[15440.25s -> 15446.22s]  No. Yes. Get rid of the shitty water surface. But I have to get rid of a titan.
[15450.63s -> 15455.11s]  They have two titans. Bless titan and then throw at this titan.
[15456.38s -> 15463.43s]  Bless titan and throw at this titan because he's got nine titans. I have six titans.
[15466.18s -> 15499.11s]  I didn't even fucking hurt him. Just start fucking roping. That was so close. That was close.
[15499.91s -> 15512.82s]  Come on. Give me a miracle here. Morale down. Come on. Give me a miracle. The titans resist
[15512.82s -> 15540.79s]  the spell. This sucks because the archers are gonna kill this. I actually think I need.
[15541.91s -> 15553.56s]  New plan. No. New plan. That's a bad plan. Doesn't matter. So I gotta get out. I'm
[15553.56s -> 15572.07s]  gonna get. I'm gonna fucking walk out and start swinging. I'm gonna go. I can't win.
[15572.07s -> 15581.74s]  It's not possible. It's impossible to win. This is the same unit. So I had three. No.
[15581.74s -> 15594.10s]  It's impossible. Just. I just wanna. He just took it without. It's empty. You're the beetle.
[15594.82s -> 15598.50s]  This is it. I got nothing. It's over. Game over. He has every single building.
[15599.14s -> 15631.24s]  He forgot about something. What? Wait, wait, wait. Back it up. Back up. Back up. What the
[15631.24s -> 15642.68s]  fuck was this? Where'd you. What? Who? How did this happen? Did he just. He just spent
[15642.68s -> 15649.40s]  every cent. How much? Five hundred and fifty. Eight two fifty. Where the fuck did you get these?
[15649.96s -> 15684.50s]  Final stand here. He has every base and every resource. Fucking stomach. Yeah,
[15684.50s -> 15692.42s]  he has every single base and every single resource. Why is this surprising to me? Don't
[15692.42s -> 15702.47s]  main one hero. I tried in the beginning. I tried to just make income. It's also something
[15702.71s -> 15707.51s]  I mean, I'm playing against eight people. You know, it's like it's a lot more chaotic and crazy.
[15707.51s -> 15717.32s]  It's hard to have more than one or two heroes. Just add 200 titans in and we're at 130 percent.
[15717.32s -> 15731.70s]  It's true. It's really like when you have an eight person map and the AI, the one AI that
[15731.70s -> 15737.45s]  forgets to move gets taken over immediately. And then whoever that AI is that took the
[15737.45s -> 15748.78s]  mobile wins the game. It's kind of what happens. All right. I can't really go anywhere.
[15748.78s -> 15759.13s]  So he's going to go like this. I'm going to step on the landmine. I'm doing teams this time.
[15761.11s -> 15778.14s]  I'm putting tan on my team. I'm doing two V2, V2, V2. Tan or purple? Who do you think?
[15778.78s -> 15789.82s]  We're going to shoot. Look, I'm just going to lead the other guy out and go take all
[15789.82s -> 15795.13s]  of his stuff. You want to green and purple? OK, that sounds good. We'll do it on a small
[15795.13s -> 15815.19s]  map too. Or small enough to go twice. Unfair. Hey, at least I guess I was going to say step
[15815.19s -> 15839.24s]  foot in the castle. I was about to hit the end. I was about to hit the fucking surrender
[15839.24s -> 15852.57s]  button. I can't go out like that. I made it to the last two. I'm OK with this. Everybody
[15852.57s -> 15889.35s]  else gets scooped up by tan's fucking insatiable conquering, whatever. Oh well.
[15889.35s -> 15899.56s]  Human players. Eight. Computer. Oh no, no, no. Seven. Other players. Let's do teams.
[15900.28s -> 15907.53s]  Water content. Road type. They don't matter. Monster strength. I mean, what does this mean?
[15908.49s -> 15920.76s]  Strong guardians. Water content. Normal. On what is this? Select single or two level map.
[15921.40s -> 15931.86s]  I'm not sure I want to do that. What does that mean? Underground. No, I don't think.
[15931.86s -> 15940.12s]  We're just gonna do extra large. No, we're just gonna do large. Two, four, six. Six players.
[15941.08s -> 15947.56s]  One, five. Not eight people. We're gonna do three v three. One v one v one. Three on each.
[15947.56s -> 15958.92s]  Two on each team. We're just gonna do a team of two versus team of two versus team of two.
[15958.92s -> 15967.16s]  Team two. Two v two v two v two. Two v two v two. I need to do this 130% difficulty. I have
[15967.16s -> 15980.36s]  to. Okay, so I'm gonna be green. Can I select green? Do I have to be? Wait, what? Random map.
[15982.22s -> 15997.11s]  Oh, team alignment. Okay, there we go. Team one is gonna be, who do I want? Tan or purple?
[15997.67s -> 16020.63s]  Who do you think? Purple. Team two. Blue and tan. Orange and green. I want to be green though.
[16024.07s -> 16037.54s]  Can I even pick that? Extra large. Okay. Normal, normal. Template.
[16038.74s -> 16054.95s]  I have no idea what the fuck this means. Do 100% this time? You think so? 100%?
[16061.34s -> 16069.56s]  I feel like with that, I feel like we're all right. I was doing okay. PvP options.
[16070.86s -> 16080.74s]  Coin flip. No, I don't want to. 100, that better be fine. We just, we just gotta get more
[16080.74s -> 16087.98s]  competent. You're not ready for 130%. Well, that's what we've been doing the whole, you
[16087.98s -> 16095.48s]  are in Australia. Extra large. Oh, large. Okay. All right. Now I want to, I want to set up,
[16095.48s -> 16104.57s]  I don't want to be red. Advanced options. How do I, I can't choose to be one of these other
[16104.57s -> 16129.85s]  players. I guess I just have to be red. Well, what do I want to do? Necropolis?
[16144.36s -> 16153.13s]  I've been killed twice in a row. Options. What else we got? Hill force. I don't know
[16153.13s -> 16159.53s]  what that even means. Advanced options. I want to, I want to, random map. I want to go back
[16159.53s -> 16170.41s]  to where I was just at. Large, one, five, team alignments, team one. So can I do that? Will
[16170.41s -> 16182.33s]  that work? Because I'll just be, I'll be green, right? No. Because usually there's a flag next
[16182.33s -> 16193.99s]  to every, everybody. I usually can just click it. No, it's because I have to, okay. So hold
[16193.99s -> 16205.88s]  on. So I have to, human or computer players. Okay. That's strange. All right. That's good.
[16205.88s -> 16212.34s]  That's good. That's good. Normal, normal, normal. Let's do advanced options. There we go. Okay.
[16213.30s -> 16228.78s]  Green and purple versus everybody else. Alignment. Yes, that's correct. All right.
[16229.34s -> 16237.80s]  Advanced options. Necropolis. What does it put in front of? Uh, too hot. Dungeon.
[16241.99s -> 16254.50s]  Stronghold. Fortress is what I just did. Conflux. Elemental. We'll do Necropolis.
[16254.50s -> 16284.31s]  Necropolis and what do I want my teammate to be? What was Ares before? There he is. All right.
[16286.28s -> 16300.14s]  I'm ready. Let's go. Teams of two. Everything should be good to go. Oh, I got to pick my
[16300.14s -> 16307.05s]  hero. Uh, don't even, I don't care what, what this is. This is what it's going to be.
[16307.77s -> 16328.74s]  Begin. Uh, that's fine. Creating map. There am I. There's my friend. Necropolis. All right.
[16328.74s -> 16344.58s]  Let's go. Let's get a second hero. Can I get a druid? First aid specialty or meteor shower.
[16344.58s -> 16359.03s]  Well, let's have you head out here and get the gold. Seer's hut.
[16360.23s -> 16364.22s]  Nowadays I have done this myself, but I need your help. A friend of mine recently had a
[16364.22s -> 16369.05s]  family heirloom stolen and wants to find it. The problem is that it looks exactly like
[16369.05s -> 16373.85s]  the pendant of free will. Please, please bring me any item that fits that description.
[16374.81s -> 16387.62s]  The artifact is not the family heirloom. I'll reward your efforts. Interesting. Money. Magic well.
[16390.18s -> 16402.82s]  Okay. Let me, let's go back. I want another hero. Let's get another necromancer. Let's,
[16402.82s -> 16411.40s]  uh, stack you up, send you up. Will the gremlins recruit lots of gremlins?
[16412.92s -> 16425.54s]  Let's actually get a save point here. Oh, it's a new game. All right. Master gremlins.
[16426.34s -> 16470.36s]  I think I already lost. Meteor shower. Get in there, skeletons. Come on.
[16470.36s -> 16497.26s]  Shit. I can't cast it again. I got this. Nice. 49 battle results. So now I should have
[16497.26s -> 16507.26s]  more skeletons. All right. 17 sulfur and then Griffin conservatory. I don't want to attack
[16507.26s -> 16510.62s]  the guards. No, I don't. I'm not going to do that right now. Let's get this level up.
[16511.58s -> 16528.46s]  It wasn't quite a level up. That's fine. Okay. Harpies. Let's go back here and spend some money.
[16532.02s -> 16535.86s]  Town hall. Or should I, I think I'm going to make a graveyard. I need,
[16535.86s -> 16547.56s]  I need enemies. I have to start getting people. Last time I did this, when I did town hall and
[16547.56s -> 16562.41s]  then I didn't, I need units. I'm going to go with the graveyard. Let's get some, oh no,
[16562.97s -> 16579.06s]  whites. Whites are, yeah, let's go. Let's go with whites and let's give those to you. All right.
[16579.06s -> 16585.80s]  What is my teammate going to do? All right. He's collecting. Let's get a second hero going out.
[16585.80s -> 16594.10s]  All right. Nice. What do you got for heroes here? This guy and this guy. Okay. Cool.
[16597.66s -> 16603.67s]  I am going to grab who has more. I'm going to actually give you the whites
[16604.23s -> 16614.84s]  and you're going to keep going. Let's grab what is this? A pack of mighty gorgons. Let's
[16614.84s -> 16623.21s]  actually grab this. Yeah. I need the wood. Gold, a horde of imps. I don't think I can
[16623.21s -> 16635.05s]  take a horde of imps right now, but I can collect this stuff. All right. Graveyard.
[16637.48s -> 16653.42s]  Get them made. Nice work. He's just picking up some resources. Very cool. I think I can
[16653.42s -> 16660.89s]  take these guys on. Horde of those little turtle enemies. What do you got? You got,
[16660.89s -> 16673.21s]  I think I could do it. They're pretty weak. Uh-huh. Wait, wait, wait. Before we do that,
[16673.21s -> 16687.93s]  grab this. Crypt. I want to search the graves with this guy. I'm terrified of what could happen
[16687.93s -> 16693.69s]  here. All right. Let's get the resources going. But you on the other hand, I have a decent
[16693.69s -> 16707.59s]  army. Let's kill him. Just in case of a fucking disaster. 25, 25. Plus I've got
[16707.59s -> 16721.59s]  fucking magic arrow too. Yeah, you get pretty weak. Float on over here. That's fine.
[16722.55s -> 16744.38s]  Aha. I get the advantage to attack you first. In fact, actually, yeah, dig it on here.
[16755.77s -> 16770.25s]  Dead. Resources. Experience. All the good stuff. I think that's all I can do. Estate.
[16770.25s -> 16791.56s]  Vampires. Bring them on. I am now going to do a town hall. Wrong building. Wrong building.
[16793.66s -> 16803.08s]  Thousand dollars a day. I've got some units here. Let's see. You. How do you, you got,
[16803.08s -> 16815.66s]  you don't have a bad selection here. You could probably kill these guys. I don't know if I could
[16815.66s -> 16827.27s]  take on the mighty Gorgons though. I'll go back and I'll give you. Oh, there's a bunch
[16827.27s -> 16835.14s]  of ton of random fucking people here. I want to give him the vampires. Make your way over
[16835.14s -> 16846.14s]  this way. I can take them. 13, 13. Magic arrow. I don't have any spells. It's all right.
[16846.14s -> 16856.54s]  Just get out there. Make a text to speech of my voice. No, I've never considered that
[16856.54s -> 16878.10s]  because anyone could get me to say literally anything they wanted. Natalia. Good. You're
[16878.10s -> 16894.25s]  watching the NBA finals. NBA finals? Who's the, who are the finals? Raptors and the Warriors.
[16897.11s -> 16913.96s]  Interesting. Raptors and Warriors. I don't really know much about either one. All right,
[16913.96s -> 16920.01s]  now the cover of darkness covers your city with a permanent shroud to all players.
[16920.65s -> 16928.20s]  If you get it to Christ Temple, maybe I get the Citadel. I'll probably get um,
[16929.42s -> 16934.39s]  blacksmith or marketplace. Start the Citadel up. Try to get through a city hall.
[16935.19s -> 16948.34s]  Or what does the mausoleum take? Mage skill level one. Okay, you. We're going to come
[16948.34s -> 16963.51s]  in here and take these. Okay, pretty good. Vampires. Me? Yes, you. How you doing over
[16963.51s -> 16973.22s]  here? Lots of pixies. Lots of walking dead. Lots of gremlins. Gremlins are weak though.
[16974.41s -> 16979.00s]  So random maps really are just all over the place, huh? I think I can.
[16979.00s -> 16983.86s]  Lots of walking dead. Can I take them? There's shit just everywhere.
[16984.74s -> 16993.83s]  They're just like spammed in every direction. Lots. I could probably take the walking dead.
[16998.06s -> 17013.03s]  Can't really move. Okay, let's go up. Lots of harpies. Board of imps. I think I can take
[17013.03s -> 17032.79s]  the imps. Let's go, uh, yeah, you up there. Vampire. How far are they? Can they do that?
[17032.79s -> 17053.06s]  Not that I'm ranged. Just let them come to me. Come to me. Four vampires. Let's see.
[17053.86s -> 17064.58s]  See how four vampires appear. Very well. Uh, I'm gonna wait with you. Oh, you're running
[17064.58s -> 17098.18s]  away? No, he's running down here. Well, okay. Very good. 240 exp and touch the obelisk.
[17098.90s -> 17113.50s]  Ooh, puzzles. I haven't leveled up for many of this though. I already did something today. Yeah,
[17113.50s -> 17125.43s]  I did. Imagine having feet. What do you mean? Everybody has feet. Now they're expanding out
[17125.43s -> 17156.58s]  here a little. Uh, let's take on the gremlins. Not strong enough. Good twice, bullshit. No more
[17156.58s -> 17185.91s]  spell power. Fuck. Make your way around. Zombies are so slow. Good damage. Keep shuffling
[17185.91s -> 17193.14s]  over there. So what, what, uh, what, uh, what is it? How much time is left in the, uh,
[17194.26s -> 17211.08s]  finals game? Gem Pond. Board of halflings. A minute and 30 seconds. That's not very long
[17211.08s -> 17218.10s]  at all. I need to get by the harpies. I think I'm, I think I'll do one week. Grab some, uh,
[17218.10s -> 17233.38s]  troops. I think so. Grab some more vampires and go kill the harpies. Yeah. Citadel. I want,
[17234.18s -> 17254.49s]  I get to upgrade. I need an amplifier so I can get better vampires and I can get more
[17254.49s -> 17264.15s]  skeletons. So that's good. All right. What are you gonna do, Purple? Just browsing around,
[17264.15s -> 17277.46s]  checking out his surroundings. All right. Level two, death knight. Advanced offense.
[17278.18s -> 17292.89s]  That's insane. 20% more damage. I kind of have to do that. We got lots of basilisks.
[17292.89s -> 17304.86s]  I can't do that. Lots of hobgoblins. Oh, that's just down there. Upgraded estate.
[17305.82s -> 17317.05s]  Vampire lords. What's the difference? No enemy retaliation. Undead. Five to eight,
[17317.05s -> 17327.05s]  30. Five to eight, 40. Drains life. Oh, they life leech. Okay. That's fucking awesome.
[17327.93s -> 17335.40s]  All right. So far so good. Uh, new week. Let's load him up, send him up north.
[17336.12s -> 17340.14s]  Oh, dwellings increase their population. Astrologists are playing week of the squirrel.
[17348.22s -> 17353.74s]  I'm going to give you the zombies and the skeletons. I'm going to leave the wraiths
[17353.74s -> 17359.66s]  because I want the other guy to have the wraiths. This is a pretty decent team.
[17360.38s -> 17373.03s]  Although what else can I build here? All right. Now marketplace or upgrade. So I do
[17373.03s -> 17381.48s]  wraiths. Grab the mausoleum. Mausoleum. Let's get some glitches. It'll be for the other
[17381.48s -> 17397.85s]  hero. We can take out these harpies now. A meteor shower. No reason to do this.
[17398.49s -> 17410.55s]  Just throw a magic arrow. And you can, how far can you go? What's your speed? Six versus nine.
[17411.43s -> 17420.49s]  So let's just chill for a minute back here. Chill again. You on the other hand, you move.
[17427.35s -> 17440.31s]  Boink. I need to go again. I'm just going to heal over and over again.
[17440.95s -> 17457.35s]  I forgot they could do that. Wow. That's awesome. These things are ridiculous.
[17469.80s -> 17483.08s]  Go. I mean, what can I do with this guy? Not much I can do.
[17485.24s -> 17495.32s]  Vampire will take it out anyways. Fly away. Whatever you do. Nice. Should level up from that.
[17497.27s -> 17506.02s]  Advanced necromancy or basic luck. 20% of the creatures killed to be brought back as
[17506.02s -> 17512.49s]  skeletons. That sounds pretty great. We're unlocked. What is this? Tree of knowledge.
[17513.21s -> 17522.63s]  Tears brim in the eyes of the tree. I need 10 gems. Well, come back when you can pay.
[17524.30s -> 17530.84s]  10 gems. Is it an empty castle? Is it a castle? Whose castle is this?
[17531.56s -> 17543.91s]  There's a fucking castle back there. All right. Um, I'm gonna, let me head back
[17544.63s -> 17552.94s]  because I want, I want the liches. I'm going for the castle.
[17553.82s -> 17573.22s]  Can I get that castle right now? There's not much in it. Let's just see what happens.
[17573.22s -> 17590.71s]  I'm not strong enough to do anything else. Can I get all three of them? Three liches.
[17592.63s -> 17596.63s]  I think if I come back and grab these three liches, I can take this castle without a
[17596.63s -> 17629.35s]  problem at all. I'm getting it. All right. So why? Pack of serpent flies. I mean,
[17629.35s -> 17636.70s]  I could, this should be easy. Pack of serpent flies. Just in case this goes horribly fucking
[17636.70s -> 17653.82s]  wrong. These things like suck. No, I wanted to cut, cast a damn spell. Get the first hit.
[17654.94s -> 17677.02s]  These things are really weak. Did I bite off more than I can chew here?
[17678.73s -> 17697.35s]  If I can attack, I may have bitten off more than I can chew. Maybe. Didn't you kill them?
[17698.23s -> 17717.29s]  Really? These little shits. Yeah, there's just too many of them. They just have like
[17717.29s -> 17734.34s]  spread out everywhere. I still might do it. Close. I still might do it.
[17735.70s -> 17752.10s]  No, I don't think so. There's too many of them. No, that's not, that's not gonna happen.
[17752.90s -> 17761.93s]  There's not, I'm sorry guys, that's not gonna happen. I was just curious. It's not gonna happen.
[17763.05s -> 17774.14s]  He's gotta do 10 push-ups now. Ow, god damn it. I gotta move this shit. I gotta get like a
[17774.14s -> 17793.37s]  different mic stand. I keep doing that. I keep banging my fucking hand. So let's go get that
[17793.37s -> 17801.93s]  castle. I'm gonna leave this for the other guy. I think I can get it with just this.
[17802.81s -> 17810.36s]  I don't want to be greedy. I could maybe attack the, no, let's get the castle.
[17811.00s -> 17829.64s]  Let's get the damn castle. Nobody fucking even in here. All right, you go restock. I can't really
[17829.64s -> 17839.24s]  do anything without money. Purple has gone into a portal. Let's see, I'm gonna pack a
[17839.24s -> 17849.02s]  Cyclops Kings. I have to start mass producing artifacts, but I gotta have one first copy.
[17849.74s -> 17856.60s]  I gotta bring you guys all this crap. This is nice. All right, this is,
[17859.27s -> 17873.10s]  blue is up here. Found the enemy. This is unclaimed. It is unclaimed for a very specific reason,
[17873.90s -> 17885.19s]  because you have to go through the pack of Cyclops Kings to take this castle. That is why
[17885.19s -> 17902.31s]  it is currently not available. You can take them. I don't know if I can take them. I don't
[17902.31s -> 17913.61s]  think that's gonna happen. Can I build anything else? Marketplace Skeleton Transformer
[17915.98s -> 17928.39s]  allows you to convert any creature into a skeleton. I need to get a marketplace in Blacksmith.
[17935.42s -> 17943.06s]  Actually, go rest in here. Just for a day. I don't know. You think it's worth, should I try it?
[17943.06s -> 17946.90s]  Blue's right there. I could fucking do this right now. If I have enough resources,
[17946.90s -> 17952.76s]  it might be possible. What you got in there? Oh, you got nothing in here.
[17953.32s -> 17962.34s]  I can take it right now for free. Go for the Cyclops Kingdom.
[17962.98s -> 17967.69s]  Try to get the pack of Cyclops, or go yoink at this city for free.
[17979.85s -> 17987.99s]  I don't know. That's so scary. The box that the Cyclops is guarding is OP. All right,
[17987.99s -> 18002.06s]  we're gonna split the timeline here. I'm dead. There's no way. That's not gonna happen.
[18013.67s -> 18021.51s]  I could just try to go forward, and I don't know. No. Five, four, three, two, one.
[18022.47s -> 18048.04s]  It's no use. I mean, if I had a little bit more, if I had a little bit more,
[18048.76s -> 18062.47s]  yeah, it's no use. If I had some more, I'm gonna go for Blue. Here's the thing. If I get Blue's
[18062.47s -> 18068.10s]  castle, then I can build up a little more, and send somebody else down to take that one.
[18068.74s -> 18080.90s]  All right, we're gonna go back to the timeline. Okay. Although there are lots of
[18080.90s -> 18084.98s]  gnolls, I could get this. I could do, okay, this is the magical garden. I could take the
[18084.98s -> 18099.11s]  gnolls. I'm gonna get it. Okay. Uh, Horde of Skeleton Warriors. I don't think I even need
[18099.11s -> 18109.69s]  to pursue them for any reason. How many gems did the tree want? Ten? I'll do it with the
[18109.69s -> 18113.50s]  other guy, because I have to bring this other guy up here anyways. I don't want to go to
[18113.50s -> 18120.92s]  South, because my buddy's got South covered. Purple's got South covered. You know, I'm
[18120.92s -> 18127.40s]  gonna, I'm going up North. Wait a minute, what's this? Hold on. Hold that thought for a
[18127.40s -> 18148.42s]  sec. I need Blacksmith. I'm at, yeah, allied with Purple. How many more days? I just feel
[18148.42s -> 18152.26s]  like this is not enough to do anything. Maybe like get rid of the gremlins and just,
[18152.26s -> 18160.06s]  can I just keep walking? Let's just see what's over here. I might be able to get these
[18160.06s -> 18173.26s]  pixies and the gremlins with this. Purple's going up. Where's Purple going? Tree? Let's
[18173.26s -> 18181.27s]  see. Plus one level. Ah, an adventurer. I'll be happy to teach you a little of what I
[18181.35s -> 18201.27s]  learned over the ages for ten gems. Just bury it around my roots. Or earth magic.
[18201.27s -> 18213.35s]  Advanced wisdom. Oh, earth magic. Earth magic's really good. Blue, how you doing? You still
[18213.99s -> 18222.89s]  got an empty castle. Yes, you do. Lots of pixies. I think I can handle it. I should
[18222.89s -> 18250.42s]  be able to. Yeah, they're weak as absolute fuck. They're terrible. There we go. Instantly
[18250.42s -> 18266.20s]  killed and almost. I'll have to lose the skeletons. Okay, cool. Lots of gremlins.
[18266.92s -> 18271.78s]  I'm not sure it's worth doing that right this second. What's over here? Monolith
[18271.78s -> 18302.68s]  one-way entrance. More pixies. Nah. Citadel. Wait for the city hall, I think. Yeah.
[18302.68s -> 18309.10s]  God damn it, he's back. Timeline. Because I went down to the tree. The timeline has
[18309.10s -> 18321.10s]  been split. That's why. Because of the tree. Because I went back into the tree. Should
[18321.10s -> 18334.10s]  have just went with the plan. Fifty dollars just came in. And a bunch of community subs
[18334.10s -> 18344.74s]  at the same time. Holy shit. Cyclops Parker just gave ten community subs and fifty dollars
[18345.30s -> 18351.70s]  at the same time. Holy shit. Thank you so much. We're with a huge amount of money.
[18352.58s -> 18355.46s]  And they say, German just wanted to thank you so much for playing this game again. It's
[18355.46s -> 18362.58s]  one of my all-time favorites. I can see why. It's great. It's really, really fun. It's
[18362.58s -> 18369.37s]  super interesting. It's challenging. You've got to manage stuff. The reason why I like
[18369.37s -> 18373.77s]  this game is there's a lot of resource management, but it's not overbearing.
[18376.20s -> 18379.56s]  It's just fun to collect stuff and look at scenarios and it's really, really fun.
[18381.88s -> 18391.64s]  I am going to keep going up. I feel like he's going to leave the castle.
[18395.32s -> 18405.61s]  And he's going to go this way. And go back. Because it's a new week here in a second.
[18410.71s -> 18416.17s]  I could have sniped the castle. I really could have. But I just didn't. I went back
[18416.17s -> 18425.70s]  down to see what the tree did. See, did he leave? Did not leave. Damn it. That
[18425.70s -> 18432.28s]  would have been so good, too. Kind of made the bed we have to sleep in, though.
[18435.21s -> 18454.73s]  What do I want to do here? I'll do Citadel. Oh, City Hall. We have a new week. Let me
[18454.73s -> 18463.94s]  take you back here. But thank you again so much to Cyclops Parker. It's a shitload of money.
[18464.95s -> 18475.14s]  Let's stock you up with people and send you back out. Unfortunately, the throng of trolls.
[18475.14s -> 18486.54s]  I'm on with two-way. I want this motherfucker to leave. Horde of pixies. Random maps really
[18486.54s -> 18490.54s]  are just so odd. It's kind of like somebody just threw up a bunch of stuff everywhere.
[18490.54s -> 18500.04s]  Alright, lots of hobgoblins. I'm going to be out here, though. I could probably do both of
[18500.04s -> 18503.64s]  these and get the experience. But he might come out and be annoyed by this.
[18508.54s -> 18519.77s]  Let's go this way. It's a lot, but I'm pretty sure I'll be fine. That's a pretty good
[18519.77s -> 18540.26s]  start. What's her speed? Five. Focus on you. Come on out. You really can't go very far,
[18540.26s -> 18561.53s]  can you? Damn it. Well, let's just eat you. They group up. That's good.
[18562.25s -> 18595.26s]  Losing a lot for a portal. I thought that was going to be enough. It is.
[18601.96s -> 18622.10s]  I'll get him back. Don't worry. These guys are strong, but they're just too slow.
[18623.56s -> 18627.48s]  Good amount of experience and a level up. Advanced earth magic or basic offense?
[18636.79s -> 18647.18s]  Probably advanced. Offense is good. 10% more damage, but I feel like I need that early.
[18647.82s -> 18653.14s]  I feel like this is good early. I need the damage.
[18658.04s -> 18661.78s]  Lots of zombies. Where the hell did I end up? This is two-way, right?
[18663.88s -> 18669.27s]  Five gems. I'm over on purple side. Quiet. What the hell is this?
[18669.99s -> 18685.27s]  It's red. This might be bad. Blue is out of the house. I'm surrounded by red.
[18687.83s -> 18694.90s]  Purple. I could use some reinforcements over here. Oh, boy. Wait a minute.
[18695.96s -> 18719.43s]  You don't. Oh, excuse me. You got one person. What about you?
[18719.43s -> 18725.32s]  Oh, several lots, several. I could wipe them both out. I think I got to what it takes.
[18727.16s -> 18761.69s]  Several lots, several. Back to base. Speaking of base. Ah, Citadel. Let's get some. I've got
[18761.69s -> 18764.65s]  to get some more units and I'm going to take him out and we're going to go north again.
[18765.29s -> 18772.52s]  Ain't nobody fucking in there. Okay, come on. We could really fuck red shit up right
[18772.52s -> 18791.03s]  now. Blue's coming down here. I might have to go on the defensive. Several, few, few,
[18791.03s -> 18798.30s]  lots, several. I might have to stick it around in here. Add to the forces.
[18799.66s -> 18813.45s]  I definitely need vampire lords and liches. I'm going to stick around in here for now.
[18815.06s -> 18818.42s]  But you, on the other hand, you. Dwarven treasury.
[18820.42s -> 18824.02s]  Dude, I want to attack the dwarven treasury and get like a bunch of money right now.
[18824.02s -> 18862.68s]  I think I'm gonna get the difficult one in the corner. You can take care of that.
[18863.48s -> 18866.86s]  I'm going up in this corner. No, I'm going to stay down here and protect
[18867.82s -> 18876.41s]  because this guy, I don't want to die. I can fly over here with him. I'm going to go
[18876.41s -> 18887.45s]  down. He's not going to be able to make it. They're so slow. You don't get to go twice.
[18887.45s -> 18932.79s]  God damn it. That sucks. Uh, I'll deal with you later. Really? Why are you guys so fucking
[18932.87s -> 18950.84s]  beefy? How much health do you have? I'm in trouble. I mean, I might, I might still do it.
[18955.10s -> 18972.63s]  Kill, kill this one. Yeah, I'll do it. I got 17 of these things. He's got the least amount,
[18972.63s -> 18983.00s]  but this guy down here. Keep this one occupied. You're going to lose, but I'll get the scalps
[18983.00s -> 18998.52s]  back. This might be worth it for the money. Dean, fly up here. Get away from those people.
[18999.40s -> 19023.53s]  Why do you get to go twice? I think it's good. It's going to be close, but I'm going to do it.
[19024.57s -> 19049.42s]  Oh man. Come on. Do it. Vampires are fucking insane. Especially the upgraded ones.
[19050.38s -> 19055.66s]  All right. That was a good fight. I got 1500 experience. I lost everything except the
[19055.66s -> 19062.06s]  vampires, but I leveled up. Basic intelligence or advanced wisdom, fourth level spells or
[19062.94s -> 19075.32s]  more spell points. Just have full stacks of vampires. Yeah, take the intelligence. 4000
[19075.32s -> 19083.05s]  golden three crystals. It was worth it because now I can protect the base. It was worth it.
[19083.05s -> 19098.26s]  It was. I had to do it. One way, one way. This, this sucks. Why does everything have to be
[19098.26s -> 19104.06s]  so weird and spread out? Now I can afford more, or I can afford a lot of this now.
[19105.94s -> 19111.11s]  Bang. I'm very protected at this point. If he comes down here,
[19111.99s -> 19119.56s]  I at least got to fortify the base. He's making his way down. What does he have?
[19120.82s -> 19138.71s]  Pretty similar. I need to get out of the base. Let me see. Who the fuck are you? Several
[19138.71s -> 19151.38s]  pack, pack several. You coming, you fucking, you wanna fuck around? Why is everybody coming
[19151.38s -> 19155.78s]  after me? What? I have like a whole other teammate. You got another castle up here?
[19158.74s -> 19166.47s]  I'm getting swarmed. I can't take on two defenses. I can, I can get rid of you right now.
[19166.47s -> 19186.25s]  On, save this. Original team timeline. Honestly, I should have just taken this base.
[19187.05s -> 19191.29s]  I should have, I shouldn't have went back down. That was a mistake. I could have just taken
[19191.29s -> 19205.43s]  blue. I, I'm, there are one, two, I'm being swarmed right now. Purple just like went this
[19205.43s -> 19221.38s]  way, uncontested and just took this. Okay. Well, I can either, I might just go kill this person
[19221.38s -> 19227.26s]  right now and then hope that I can get enough. Cause this is a lot coming in.
[19228.38s -> 19231.18s]  Hopefully you just go over here, but then you'll get the fucking castle.
[19231.98s -> 19243.91s]  Damn it. Well, we'll see what happens. Here we go. Okay. Now I am going to kill you
[19244.47s -> 19248.92s]  cause you're not coming up. Blue's not coming this way. I need to go back
[19249.80s -> 19268.20s]  through this portal. Port of imps. I have to fight these zombies to get through the portal again.
[19268.84s -> 19282.36s]  How did I get out? First of all, I'm going to delete you. Like I don't like you over here.
[19282.36s -> 19292.60s]  I don't like what you're doing. I'm killing her. Here are your ranged units.
[19293.48s -> 19306.14s]  Let's go with the eyeball. That's a better shot. I don't have a good angle on anybody.
[19307.02s -> 19318.22s]  I'll do it like I could do it here. Get the other ranged. Fly up this way.
[19319.42s -> 19330.38s]  The lich. That's fine. Just all focusing on him and he's going to die.
[19332.02s -> 19344.23s]  All right. Uh, I'm going straight into here. Or maybe I should get you stone skin to, uh,
[19344.23s -> 19369.94s]  you see if I can kill you. Cause you're ranged right here. Flying back. Gotta get you.
[19369.94s -> 19389.00s]  Let's go. You up here. I might actually lose. I mean, this motherfucker is just going to walk
[19389.00s -> 19400.14s]  around and just take all my resources. I had to do something. Get my rates in there.
[19400.94s -> 19424.92s]  Good. There we go. I have one skeleton. Hi. No, I got it. Open. It's going to happen.
[19425.72s -> 19449.94s]  Vampire is too strong. It's good. Good to go. You've been defeated. Advanced necromancy
[19449.94s -> 19466.02s]  or basic armor. So you've been vanquished. That's good. Five skeletons have been brought in.
[19466.02s -> 19472.44s]  I could have got this asshole to deal with though. He went up here. He's just hanging
[19472.44s -> 19479.61s]  out over here. He's going to go in the portal. I think. Oh shit. He's going to go in the
[19479.61s -> 19491.61s]  portal that I'm standing in front of. I'm screwed. Is it a different one? I hope so. All
[19491.61s -> 19497.05s]  right. I need 10,000. I think it's time to upgrade some of these. Let's get,
[19497.85s -> 19515.59s]  let's do this up. This is the wraith upgrade. Let's see what happens. Going in the portal. No,
[19516.15s -> 19525.02s]  deciding against it. Where's purple going? My buddy perp. The one issue that I have is I,
[19525.02s -> 19536.26s]  can I kill lots of zombies with just seven vampires? I'm not sure I can. I know I
[19536.26s -> 19586.01s]  can do this. Let me do this first. Everybody collapse on the goblins. Hello. Death. Hurray.
[19586.01s -> 19595.58s]  Nice job. Give me that. One way exit. One way entrance. Where the hell is all this stuff
[19595.58s -> 19603.42s]  going? They're everywhere. I feel like I'm in the arcane sanctuary. What the hell else is
[19603.42s -> 19613.88s]  even over here? Let's see if I can do it. I mean, they're pretty sloppy, but I don't
[19613.88s -> 19619.06s]  have enough to do any of this. We just have to fly over there and what's your speed? Four.
[19620.42s -> 19635.77s]  I should kill you very quickly. Three zombies perish. I don't think so.
[19635.93s -> 19647.91s]  Fifteen. No, I'm gonna lose. It's only maybe. Maybe. If I can keep healing, maybe.
[19655.78s -> 19666.18s]  I don't think I'm gonna do it. I can't heal. Yeah, I cannot steal life from dead things.
[19667.77s -> 19680.18s]  Yep. Well, this was a mistake. Can't heal from the undead. I didn't even know that.
[19681.14s -> 19690.33s]  I just didn't realize that. I know I said I wasn't gonna save scum anymore,
[19692.73s -> 19714.73s]  but I am. I'm kind of just fucking stuck back here. I'm stuck back here. I don't have enough to do
[19714.73s -> 19721.16s]  anything. Can I like make my way over to purple? Do I have any way to get back to purple?
[19724.04s -> 19729.94s]  I really don't think I can go anywhere. Let's see what happens if I go this way.
[19730.74s -> 19745.35s]  Is there a place to go down here maybe? Can I build anything? What day is it? Day five.
[19748.23s -> 19766.41s]  Hall of Darkness. Six thousand. I'll save it so we can get the growth. One way entrance.
[19766.41s -> 19770.97s]  Should I just go in this shit? I'm gonna end up somewhere. I'm gonna end up with like a wall.
[19773.77s -> 19790.49s]  I can't even move any further. Maybe it'll be this one. That's the hope, right? Red's coming
[19790.49s -> 19811.75s]  over to blue. Red and blue teammates. Let's go back. Power liches. I think I want to get that.
[19812.39s -> 19825.22s]  Do I need another castle? Do I need more money? Yeah. Well, let's see. Let's go next week.
[19825.94s -> 19842.04s]  Or almost next week. Cross your fingers. Three, two, one. Yes.
[19843.74s -> 19859.53s]  I'm fine. Hooray. Thank god. All right, here comes the growth. Before that happens though,
[19859.53s -> 19871.38s]  can I get a Hall of Darkness? I cannot, but I can upgrade the mausoleum so power liches
[19871.38s -> 19886.78s]  are available. 11, 15, 40. 11, 13, 30. Okay, cool. Let's go. Red has taken over that castle.
[19887.34s -> 19893.90s]  It's orange. I haven't seen orange the first time. There's orange right there.
[19894.70s -> 19911.88s]  Not very much. And it's empty. All right. Let's get power liches. Actually, no. Let's do
[19911.88s -> 19932.44s]  vampires first. I need to go down. No, you need to go back and get like minions. I have
[19932.44s -> 19937.70s]  seven fucking things. This other guy's coming up. You've got enough to do something.
[19939.50s -> 19949.19s]  Head down. I can start clearing this shit out and actually taking this stuff and then meeting
[19949.19s -> 19969.14s]  down with purple here. Let's just go here. No money. You come down here. So let's get these.
[19976.09s -> 19985.75s]  Lots of walking dead. Do not engage. That's all I can really do this week.
[19987.08s -> 20000.46s]  Don't. He's coming down. Shit. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. What's he coming down with?
[20004.49s -> 20022.47s]  Pack, few, few, several, lots. No, horrible. By the time he gets here, I'll have a force
[20022.47s -> 20029.51s]  and he won't be able to get it. I highly doubt that. I think I can get this one too.
[20030.39s -> 20039.24s]  Think about engaging. Why would I? It's just free stuff. Lord of Halflings. Let's see what
[20039.24s -> 20061.51s]  happens. Here he comes on his way. You're going to be throwing shit. So might as well just fly
[20061.51s -> 20069.10s]  over there. You're going to be throwing shit. Ares isn't helping. He's kind of just doing his
[20069.10s -> 20075.77s]  own thing down there. I'm not sure he's seen any action at all. I've had like two or three
[20075.77s -> 20095.24s]  encounters, which I started at the bottom. I started at the bottom where I got all the stuff
[20095.24s -> 20102.47s]  and nobody fought me. No, it's still all right. I'm not like in a great position, but
[20103.27s -> 20107.11s]  I mean, what am I going to do? What am I going to cry about it? What am I going to cry?
[20111.69s -> 20131.32s]  Lots of hobgoblins. Let's do these first. Six power liches. That's all I can do for now.
[20131.32s -> 20137.86s]  I can do some skeletons. I'm afraid of you. I don't think you're going to come over here
[20137.86s -> 20146.20s]  though. I could be wrong. I don't think that one has very much stuff though.
[20148.55s -> 20170.70s]  All right. Purple. You're fucking walking in circles. Yeah, this is not very much. That's
[20170.70s -> 20179.29s]  decent. I might take it. I might go for it. Pack a few, few lots of pixies though.
[20180.09s -> 20192.17s]  Let's do this down here first. Some wood down here. Hobgoblins.
[20193.29s -> 20202.46s]  Should be easy enough. Pixies of skeleton fuel. Yeah, that's true.
[20222.09s -> 20229.80s]  Wood. Campfire. 100 bucks. I'll take it. Pack of zealots. All right.
[20230.60s -> 20236.28s]  Pack, pack, few. I think it's time to attempt something here. I can get a couple more.
[20237.08s -> 20261.53s]  At least fill up a little bit. It's time to defend the home. The only dangerous thing here
[20261.53s -> 20270.38s]  is this. Meteor shower. I can hit up both, except that's ice. I should hit these two down
[20270.38s -> 20280.28s]  here. Air. Sprites. He is like made out of fire. I'm probably going to do it down here.
[20282.73s -> 20286.74s]  I can't hit him with any spells. I think I should just do it up here.
[20290.76s -> 20303.96s]  Might as well. That's fine. Do you have ranged? No, you don't. Anybody have ranged.
[20306.17s -> 20315.35s]  None of you have ranged. So let's hang back for a minute. That's your speed. Six.
[20315.35s -> 20335.26s]  Six. Get rid of you. This should be pretty clean. Should get first attack advantage on
[20335.26s -> 20342.73s]  everybody here. I wonder if I should go just focus on the fire elemental with the
[20342.73s -> 20353.82s]  air elemental. Fire elemental. No retaliation. That's good. Yeah, get rid of the elemental.
[20364.65s -> 20371.40s]  I really want to get rid of the skeletons, apparently. Well, whatever you do,
[20371.48s -> 20384.07s]  you're dead. Let's go with the 20 of the pixies.
[20386.84s -> 20403.99s]  Instantly kill it. You're now surrounded. Don't fucking retreat. I was trying to stop that
[20403.99s -> 20414.09s]  from happening. Retreated. Dick. I'm taking that castle. I'm going up right fucking now.
[20426.65s -> 20454.78s]  That castle is going to be mine in a second. Purple, come up. What do we got down here?
[20455.42s -> 20463.94s]  I don't care about that. Hoarder gremlins. I can handle the Hoarder gremlins.
[20465.46s -> 20485.58s]  This should be very easy. At least I hope so. Purple's gonna have a huge army.
[20486.98s -> 20490.10s]  Yeah, by the time this all is over with, I should have done that. Sorry.
[20493.37s -> 20496.65s]  I'm just being the wall right now. I'm just trying to protect everything and try to stop
[20496.65s -> 20501.69s]  them from encroaching while Purple gets five million people in his army. Okay, here we go.
[20501.69s -> 20516.14s]  Expert necromancy. I want that. And I want the bank. Can't move. Capital. I'm gonna wait.
[20519.19s -> 20532.17s]  Don't go in there! Blue's dead. Did Purple just take another castle that wasn't
[20533.45s -> 20551.59s]  a neutral castle? There ain't much in here, man. I think I can do it. I'm not as well
[20551.59s -> 20561.08s]  to take it. I think I'm gonna be just good. We found a naga bank. Do you wish to attack
[20561.08s -> 20571.58s]  the guards? 42, 8, 16, 10. Red has another guy right there. Yeah, Red does have another guy.
[20576.06s -> 20590.82s]  Ooh! New castle! I just have to go through the imps. Shit! Okay, things are looking up.
[20591.38s -> 20612.71s]  And I'm gonna get a capital. Tans down there. Come on, Purple, keep building. So this is just
[20612.71s -> 20624.25s]  a random castle. Can I- do I have enough to take it? I think I do. Do I though? It might
[20624.25s -> 20630.84s]  not be. I think I can get it. Let me just make sure- let me just put it in a safe point.
[20633.61s -> 20641.59s]  Oh, I thought it was a castle. What is it with this? I thought it was gonna have like a
[20641.59s -> 20662.33s]  to-lay siege. It doesn't have a fort. Okay. Well, all right, I'll do it. At least I have
[20662.33s -> 20682.79s]  another castle now. I got it. The castle is mine. Perfect. Now let me look up here.
[20683.43s -> 20720.79s]  You've left a little bit. This is still down here. He just came out. He was inside.
[20721.51s -> 20728.46s]  I'm never gonna get two birds with one stone here. I'm gonna hang out in there for now.
[20729.42s -> 20738.04s]  Is he just hanging out in there? Basic resistance or advanced intelligence?
[20738.84s -> 20765.74s]  I'm gonna say advanced intelligence. Build a fort. Five grand! How much are these worth?
[20765.74s -> 20771.32s]  I can take them all, right? I don't think I even want these things. Well, I mean,
[20772.20s -> 20779.98s]  I just got more people. I'm gonna claim some stuff.
[20783.80s -> 20792.38s]  Horde of royal griffons. Experience. Okay, this is the point when I decided this is worth
[20792.38s -> 20813.29s]  doing. I might be wrong. Just learned fireball. He doesn't even have a fort! He doesn't
[20813.29s -> 20828.36s]  have a fucking fort built! What? Why? I got this in the bag. I can take out the...
[20833.16s -> 20848.50s]  Yeah, I can probably melt almost all of them. Good. Right off the bat. Go down here. No,
[20848.50s -> 20862.73s]  let's go... Yeah, down here. That's fine. Skeletons. I'm gonna stay together. Who is
[20862.73s -> 20871.30s]  the threat? Nobody has ranged. I'm just gonna go after you, because you're the strongest.
[20883.30s -> 20901.00s]  Bullshit. Didn't you go three fucking times? Fireball? No. Stone skin. Shield.
[20901.96s -> 20905.30s]  Magic. It's just stone skin. This is technically melee, right?
[20908.39s -> 20919.34s]  All right, surround him. He's not gonna be able to do anything. I guess he is.
[20920.54s -> 20924.09s]  Sorry. I'm gonna get it. Focus on the one that we're focusing on.
[20932.81s -> 20945.21s]  Now you decide to come over here. I can't attack. Whatever. Just get him.
[20946.09s -> 20954.73s]  You really want to get these liches, huh? Should I just run?
[20956.23s -> 20960.98s]  Should I just fucking run away? No, I can kill him. He's not gonna retaliate.
[20961.62s -> 20977.75s]  This should be it. Castle's mine. 660s? What do you... Oh, it was Luna. I remember Luna.
[20978.31s -> 20985.99s]  Basic Scholar! Trading spells between spellbooks or advanced earth magic. Probably
[20985.99s -> 21000.74s]  advanced earth magic. Dude, that's... This is fucking two castles in 15 minutes. And I can
[21000.74s -> 21008.84s]  get some more creatures. How do you not have a fort? Interesting. All right, well...
[21016.31s -> 21022.36s]  Park here for a second. So I got one, two, three. I got three castles now. This one is
[21022.36s -> 21032.89s]  down here. All right, I got my buddy going down here. That's our end of our turn. Red's
[21032.89s -> 21040.71s]  probably pissed. Purple stills just stop piling. Massive amounts of money. Expert offense!
[21041.43s -> 21059.14s]  Oh, we're basic ballistics. I probably would do offense. I just want to be able
[21059.14s -> 21068.44s]  to do damage, man. Lots of familiars and horde of harpy hags. I got a pretty decent
[21068.44s -> 21085.86s]  army here. Let me go up here though. I need a city hall. Or I need a fort. Five grand? 2020?
[21087.14s -> 21101.90s]  I need another hero. Probably just from here. Look at all this. There's so much here.
[21103.51s -> 21114.06s]  There's my tavern. Death knight or witch? I mean, I have like three death knights.
[21116.66s -> 21129.51s]  I have the... am I supposed to do super necromancer? No, for a second I was like,
[21129.51s -> 21136.33s]  what's with the second photo that was taken? That person just lifted their arm up and you
[21136.33s -> 21146.39s]  took like three photos at the same time. Just like click click click. Okay, how we doing?
[21147.45s -> 21158.23s]  Purple, how we doing? Purple's got lots of shit down here. They still have that. Bastards.
[21159.03s -> 21172.78s]  It's time to come out. I'm coming out. Fort. I'm coming out. We're gonna get rid of these
[21172.78s -> 21183.48s]  pixies. And there's a bank right there. Orc chieftain. Let's go up. There's a learned land
[21183.48s -> 21191.90s]  mine that's good. What's this over here? All right, I think I can take these people on. But
[21192.54s -> 21201.51s]  I would just save them just in case something fucking horrible happens. Third level spell.
[21202.23s -> 21215.11s]  Murph. Lots of gnolls. Take them easily I think. Show Otto's feet.
[21222.82s -> 21232.33s]  Didn't we talk about this like already like a few weeks ago? Yeah, Kim like wrote that and
[21232.33s -> 21242.15s]  then it did the the fucking lid blew off. Ban that person. Well, it was my girlfriend.
[21242.15s -> 21274.25s]  So Kim's banned. That's who it was. Ban that person. And go. Holy shit. You guys,
[21274.25s -> 21283.22s]  I'm not strong. You guys are not strong at all. You're not strong to a point where I'm
[21283.22s -> 21290.14s]  embarrassed for even coming over here with the wolf riders. Jeremy, we're gonna get banned to
[21290.14s -> 21302.06s]  the couch. Prison. In a dazzling display of daring, you break into the local jail and
[21302.06s -> 21310.84s]  free the hero imprisoned here who in return pledges loyalty to your cause. What? Level five,
[21310.84s -> 21327.26s]  Malcolm. I got a new hero. Sick. Oh, that's so cool. And I'm at the end down here so
[21327.26s -> 21349.45s]  there's nothing else to claim. Court of Harpy. What's their speed? They can go pretty far.
[21349.45s -> 21364.65s]  I'm gonna just wait for them. I don't think you can go that far. They're all going down.
[21364.65s -> 21381.86s]  Why are you all going down? All of you are going that way? Uh oh. Every single one of
[21381.86s -> 21390.26s]  them is. I might, I might run backwards. I did not expect every single one of them to
[21390.26s -> 21396.47s]  come down here and get a fucking line. Uh. Shit. I'm gonna fly away with the uh.
[21397.43s -> 21411.77s]  I think I have to fly away. I don't have meteor on this character. This character doesn't
[21411.77s -> 21420.18s]  have it. I'm screwed. I mean I have 82 skeletons up here but every single one of them flew down
[21420.18s -> 21431.10s]  three. Like what the hell is this? This is bullshit. It's what it is. Um. I just sent
[21431.10s -> 21440.79s]  people. Whatever. What am I gonna do? Run? I mean I think I am. Am I stand and fight
[21441.35s -> 21445.27s]  or do I fly back here to the friends? I think I'm going back to the friends.
[21445.91s -> 21457.70s]  Yep. 82 skeletons coming in. Go. What is this dog shit? Why do they get it like every time?
[21458.66s -> 21493.43s]  Walls. Get him down here. Just wait till my big brother shows up. And oh why don't you go again?
[21493.43s -> 21498.89s]  Just go again. Why don't you just go again? I don't think I've seen that spell on my character in
[21498.89s -> 21513.58s]  like fucking a week. Well now I'm gonna head back this way. I just didn't expect this shit.
[21513.58s -> 21517.26s]  This is somewhat like kind of dumb fucking strategy that the computer decided to do right
[21517.26s -> 21547.51s]  now. How could I have ever expected that this was gonna happen? Get in here. This
[21547.51s -> 21562.71s]  necklace better be fucking worth it. All right we're in. I hate these things so much.
[21563.67s -> 21634.79s]  One of you die. Jesus. Tally it and kill it. This is so stupid. The idiocy involved in how
[21634.79s -> 21653.29s]  this played out. This is dumb. We're in the fucking corner. This is as far in the corner
[21653.29s -> 21666.09s]  with everybody. What the hell? I'm gonna hopefully I get a bunch of skeletons for this.
[21677.64s -> 21686.02s]  If I lose this, I don't even know man. I'm gonna fucking lose my mind if I don't win this.
[21687.88s -> 21705.91s]  No there's no way. I'm gonna win. Thanks for the artifact. Five percent more damage or what?
[21706.47s -> 21719.88s]  I mean that's better. Wisdom or spell? I need more spells. I don't have any.
[21724.74s -> 21730.10s]  What is it? I can't even look at it. Fucking hell. That fight sucked.
[21730.82s -> 21745.10s]  Tan's coming down. Necklace of Dragon Teeth. Please that would be worth something.
[21746.38s -> 21752.07s]  Warn about the neck. This item increases your knowledge and power skills by plus
[21752.07s -> 21757.27s]  three. That's actually really good. That's really good actually.
[21757.99s -> 21766.86s]  I'm not upset by that. I'm actually very happy about that. Now I don't have enough
[21766.86s -> 21774.02s]  to get this and I don't think he does either. A horde of... Do I really? I think I have to
[21774.02s -> 21777.94s]  come back at another time. Maybe I could combine them together and I could take this.
[21778.66s -> 21793.69s]  I could give him the centaurs and orcs. That's like 50 to 100 frogs. No I can't. It's not
[21793.69s -> 21807.80s]  gonna happen. Not with like this tiny little group. Let's plant this hero up here. Save
[21807.80s -> 21815.02s]  game. Yes I will. I wish it wasn't gonna be like this but it is. What is up here?
[21816.06s -> 21824.18s]  Earth elementals. Artifact. Spirit of oppression versus a horde of harpy. I don't
[21824.18s -> 21830.14s]  want to fight harpy hags again but I think I'm about to. Am I about to fight a horde of
[21830.14s -> 21851.32s]  harpy hags again for another? All right what can I do here? You're ready to come out.
[21852.87s -> 21862.22s]  What? In a second. Now you are. No you're not. I want you to get more. I'm gonna put the
[21862.22s -> 21908.50s]  dwarf in that building. I'm getting awfully closer. Can I... This is not gonna be good.
[21909.46s -> 21924.78s]  He's gonna take the castle probably. I'm fucked. Well just take this and whatever. He's...
[21924.78s -> 21933.88s]  I can get it right back. Like what am I gonna do? There's no fort. Yeah he's gonna have to
[21933.88s -> 21959.40s]  build a fucking fort. We'll just keep moving on. Little doggie. I think that's Midas. I don't
[21959.40s -> 21973.90s]  think that's Otto. Can I do anything else? Hold on let me be right back. Let's see if
[21973.90s -> 22099.74s]  something else is like going on. Hold on. Be right back. I have no idea. Midas was just
[22099.82s -> 22116.47s]  barking it. A ghost? I don't know. Maybe it was a skeleton. Hmm. All right do I want
[22118.50s -> 22137.34s]  you or you? Well I need to... Here. You go here. Okay. Just take this castle while I stare at you.
[22137.34s -> 22142.70s]  He doesn't really have that much either. That's the thing that sucks is he just he's
[22142.70s -> 22152.33s]  gonna just walk in and take it and then I'm gonna take it back. This is gonna be so dumb.
[22152.33s -> 22155.61s]  No he decided against it. He's coming down this way now. Good because now I'll just kill
[22155.61s -> 22161.29s]  him. All right purple I'm gonna need you to start swooping around the other side
[22161.29s -> 22171.72s]  to stop collecting resources and get over here. Several lots pack several. Who's dead?
[22185.13s -> 22191.88s]  26 18 8. I think that's enough. Purple doesn't give a shit about me. I know that's it that's
[22191.88s -> 22197.62s]  what like get over here. Kill something. Fight something. You just what are you doing with
[22197.62s -> 22204.25s]  this thing? Look at all this around you. You look at you look how many enemies you have.
[22204.25s -> 22215.35s]  Wait let me look at these heroes. All right really dude get over here. Orange is just in
[22215.35s -> 22224.09s]  your base. I'm going down there. I gotta find a way to get over there. You're right you've been
[22224.09s -> 22228.95s]  hiding over here too haven't you? See look I'm just they're attacking me and he's just
[22228.95s -> 22243.82s]  collecting fucking. This guy's just hiding back here. Pack lots lots several. God damn
[22243.82s -> 22258.58s]  it. I should just stay in the damn castle right? I mean I'm gonna upgrade the I'm gonna
[22258.58s -> 22270.76s]  upgrade this. Turn the skeletons into skeleton warriors. Can't do it yet. Well let's just
[22270.76s -> 22277.14s]  continue what I was doing here. You go in here. Park yourself that way. I don't have any money
[22277.14s -> 22291.58s]  to do anything. I would like for you to get back in here. Collected that thing. Yeah and
[22291.58s -> 22297.82s]  then maybe I'll go in that portal. Hang out in here for now. We're gonna be a turtle for a
[22297.82s -> 22307.00s]  minute just because of what's going on over here. Lord of swordsmen. Lots of walking dead.
[22307.08s -> 22309.72s]  I can't really do anything though. The dwarf will come out and take care of that
[22310.52s -> 22319.82s]  tomorrow. We're both just standing here. Purple are you just gonna let him do this?
[22323.88s -> 22338.20s]  He's picking strawberries. Well everything is taken from him. I don't think I can beat
[22338.20s -> 22353.05s]  the hellhounds. More vampires. That's all I can do at the moment. I need more like money
[22353.05s -> 22358.41s]  making castles. All right next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make some more citadels.
[22359.29s -> 22375.38s]  Or some more money. Like a town hall. Yeah okay I need a tavern. Tavern town hall down here.
[22383.10s -> 22388.95s]  Man am I gonna buy this game? Oh I hope you do. Purple what the fuck are you doing?
[22391.02s -> 22398.84s]  They brought the... Purple is gonna lose. I hope you do. It's really really good. It's
[22398.84s -> 22410.78s]  a really fun game. It's super fun. Super interesting. It's very very good. I might be
[22410.78s -> 22416.09s]  able to get this castle if I try. Am I using the HD mod? Yes I am. This is the original
[22416.09s -> 22432.42s]  one from good old games with the complete pack and the HD patch on top of it. I'm gonna
[22432.42s -> 22440.49s]  stick with the plan. I'm gonna buy the tavern and then so I could get to the town hall
[22440.49s -> 22449.19s]  to make money. I don't know what is left over here. I'm gonna fortify and I'm gonna
[22449.19s -> 22456.98s]  come up and kill this guy. Some more liches. Skeletal warriors. I can't.
[22457.94s -> 22478.25s]  I think I can kill him right now. I think so. He's not gonna come in the face. I know
[22478.25s -> 22486.01s]  that for a fact. Several lots. Several. Yeah he's dead. He doesn't have fucking anything.
[22489.13s -> 22495.62s]  Let's get rid of the ranged which is who does more damage? Six to eight and three five.
[22496.66s -> 22504.76s]  Let's cast this on you. Try to get rid of you first. I mean like let's go.
[22513.21s -> 22522.54s]  Here. Perfect spot. Thanks for going there. Just helped me out so bad. It is a very timeless
[22522.54s -> 22527.34s]  game. It is and even though I mean I'm not necessarily like that great at it.
[22528.30s -> 22533.02s]  It's just interesting. It's fun. I never really liked games like this. Games with tile based
[22533.82s -> 22542.94s]  movement and strategy management. It's not really my type of game but it just is fun.
[22542.94s -> 22547.98s]  It's something about it. You know the movement. It's that movement I really like.
[22549.50s -> 22558.94s]  Oh my god. Speaking of the movement. I tried to fucking. Hey making a good point for the game
[22558.94s -> 22581.62s]  here right now. It's all good. I think I can get in here and do this too. So there goes one.
[22582.18s -> 22590.02s]  It's tan. I'm just gonna save it again. I think I can handle this. No I can't. I don't
[22590.02s -> 22599.00s]  have any confidence. All right well that gets tan out of here. You need to keep going this way.
[22600.52s -> 22608.73s]  What's down here? Is that a peak? Lizard warriors? I can get this stuff. I just need a
[22608.73s -> 22616.82s]  pyro that can do it. You. Or you up here. One of you do it. One of you do something.
[22616.82s -> 22628.38s]  All right. Harpy hags. After I. You understand? Red just came through again.
[22628.38s -> 22662.74s]  I don't know what my teammate is doing. Horde. I wonder if it's enough. There's a fort here right?
[22664.26s -> 22677.11s]  Fuck. There's no fort. I don't have a fort. I might as well just walk out and fight him.
[22677.11s -> 22685.26s]  He might not even come after me though. And then I'm gonna make the stroll this way.
[22686.52s -> 22696.33s]  All right. From here I'm taking. I'm taking these guys out to the right. I'm going for it.
[22696.41s -> 22704.38s]  Let's gonna start the journey now. Or maybe I'm gonna. No I'll meet. Where's my other dude?
[22706.31s -> 22709.93s]  Yeah you. We're gonna trade here. Trade places. You head into the.
[22711.26s -> 22718.39s]  Into the castle. You're gonna help this way. I gotta at least stop moving around man.
[22719.03s -> 22726.36s]  All right. This is a decent force. What was I gonna. What was I gonna do here?
[22726.36s -> 22733.46s]  No it's down here. A town hall. Right. Town hall. Town hall. Town hall. Town hall. Town hall.
[22733.46s -> 22741.32s]  Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Town hall tomorrow. Who's this? Oh fuck. They caught me.
[22745.59s -> 22767.45s]  Um. I could just retreat. Yeah. It's not worth it. I'm out. It's not worth it.
[22768.86s -> 22771.90s]  That sucked so bad because he didn't have anything. He had like five units.
[22772.54s -> 22791.66s]  Keep going this way. I'm not going in there. Coward streamer. Tonight yes.
[22802.47s -> 22859.75s]  Phone's ringing now. Hold on a second. What is happening in this household? Okay hi. We're
[22859.75s -> 22867.82s]  under attack here. Okay you know when you like investigate. You're like what's happening outside?
[22867.82s -> 22880.09s]  You like open up. There's nothing there. Had to let somebody in. We're under attack.
[22880.73s -> 22886.60s]  Imagine like opening the door. You think like somebody's out there. Like oh like the dog's
[22886.60s -> 22892.15s]  barking. Let me like. We're under attack. You swing the door open. You scream that outside.
[22892.15s -> 22904.89s]  It's like a mailman. Hey here's your mail. Oh thanks. Thank you. So let's go. Let me
[22904.89s -> 22917.18s]  make it a big picture here. I need a big picture. No you open the door and it's a knight in armor
[22917.18s -> 22925.10s]  screaming we're under attack. Uh I would close the door. I'd close the door and I would just
[22925.10s -> 22929.34s]  get the phone as fast as I could and dial diamond money as fast as possible and be like
[22929.34s -> 22933.42s]  this somebody hit me out of their mind and I think they're going to fucking come after me.
[22935.62s -> 22943.06s]  You need to die. No no no no no. Do everything that you're supposed to do.
[22944.57s -> 22963.19s]  Town hall. Yes town hall gives me money. Oh shit you can't see. Now you can. That's what I wanted
[22963.19s -> 22970.92s]  to do. I don't have any more leftover money. I guess I could buy a little bit of stuff just
[22970.92s -> 22976.12s]  in case somebody decides to come to the castle. You're over here. All right I've got to stop
[22976.12s -> 22984.60s]  moving people around. You come out. Is there anybody around here? I don't think there is.
[22984.60s -> 22990.02s]  You're just gonna go into this fucking portal. Well should I leave him just to defend? You've
[22990.02s -> 22997.80s]  got a lot of people though. Maybe not. Maybe not. I got a scout. I have somebody guarding here. I
[22997.80s -> 23006.95s]  have nobody in this one but I have somebody about to be building up in here. Those fucking
[23006.95s -> 23029.10s]  harpies. Yeah go kill it. I think I can kill them right? I'm just scum. Put it again.
[23029.90s -> 23041.27s]  Part two. I like shouldn't have even done this but it is the other hero so that's good.
[23042.07s -> 23047.78s]  I'm gonna get slaughtered. I don't know. I'll be all right. I'm not. I ain't gonna move.
[23048.42s -> 23080.42s]  Bunch up again please. I hope you do. Bunch up down here. Oh please do it. Let's go right here.
[23081.22s -> 23103.35s]  Can German still run at 60 miles per hour? Yeah I think so. I ain't gonna go in. Actually
[23103.35s -> 23122.49s]  yeah I am. I'm going on this one. This is going for the uh the genie. Of course do it again.
[23123.45s -> 23145.62s]  By all means just go twice. Harpies. All right let's move in. One of these guys.
[23147.96s -> 23158.14s]  So there is an artifact behind. I wonder what it is. I will do a single target move on you.
[23159.02s -> 23164.22s]  I don't think it's necessary to do anything else. Like for instance we could do ice bolt
[23164.22s -> 23185.90s]  on you. No on you. Harpy's dead. It's gonna be decent experience and I'll get the artifact
[23185.90s -> 23199.05s]  behind. It should be good enough. At least I think it will. Save. Save. Save. 1200 experience.
[23199.05s -> 23206.98s]  1300. No level up but I get this stuff. Spirit of oppression. I can't get it yet but you know
[23206.98s -> 23223.24s]  what I mean. That was a plane taking off apparently. We're under attack. Guys like
[23223.24s -> 23239.88s]  flying around and take a fucking plane. Yeah it's a one seater plane. Why am I still
[23239.88s -> 23244.36s]  streaming? Have I lost my mind? What? It's only been like six and a half hours. It's not been
[23244.36s -> 23253.93s]  that long. This is it. After this. This is it. I gotta get a victory here. All right there you
[23253.93s -> 23262.46s]  are. We're good. Next day. I'm looking for a collapse from purple. Or can I like to steal
[23262.46s -> 23266.87s]  resources? Can I have resources? I can. Right we're on the same team. Can I like take money
[23266.87s -> 23295.51s]  from you? Wait why can... Am I using my money for this? Wait a minute. I can make heroes
[23295.51s -> 23308.82s]  and use them from odd. Okay well we have a lot of territory. 2000 seagulls saved and that's
[23308.82s -> 23319.26s]  when the command gets deleted. Command's gonna get deleted. Horde of sprites. Uh horde of gnolls.
[23320.38s -> 23330.63s]  Just head through here. School of magic. Plus one spell power. This is leading us down here
[23331.19s -> 23341.16s]  Is it Pandora's box down here? What is it? Spirit of oppression. This item negates all
[23341.16s -> 23350.79s]  morale bonuses during combat for both you and your opponent. That is not that good.
[23351.35s -> 23357.45s]  But I will take more of these air elementals. What about earth elementals? Lots of earth.
[23357.45s -> 23390.65s]  Maybe they'll join me. You think it's a scenario where they'll join? I'm not gonna. Come on.
[23390.65s -> 23401.37s]  That's imp cash though. That sounds good. What do we got down here? I have like a fort here,
[23401.37s -> 23408.46s]  right? Capital. Okay I need a capital. Do I not have a capital yet? How the fuck have I not
[23408.46s -> 23416.07s]  had a capital? City. I don't have a city hall here. All right I need to fuck the city hall.
[23424.52s -> 23440.73s]  Tan orange red? Who's left? Well that's all. You screwed down there.
[23441.69s -> 23454.66s]  This guy right here is so just I can kill him if I really wanted to. Let's do a ice bolt.
[23456.50s -> 23484.81s]  Kill him is weak. I will after I do this. Fly on over here.
[23487.24s -> 23501.42s]  Skeletons are just gonna be targets here. So he will kill him, they will kill them,
[23501.42s -> 23514.04s]  and this guy will just walk around with a broken foot. Not a big deal. Spell power
[23514.20s -> 23523.16s]  plus one. Advanced wisdom or basic scouting. I'm gonna say advanced wisdom which leads us to this
[23523.16s -> 23535.32s]  imp cash. We're gonna attack the imps. Perhaps. Let's see what's in there. I might not have enough
[23535.32s -> 23542.36s]  to do this. I'm kind of too spread out. It's too thin. I'll try it though. Yeah this is not
[23543.08s -> 23560.23s]  bad. Let's do ice bolt on you. Yeah they'll die in one hit or maybe two hits.
[23564.28s -> 23575.61s]  We'll make it. So there'll be money in here probably hopefully.
[23576.98s -> 23583.82s]  Games are always wins. Yeah they kind of are. These area elementals are pretty good.
[23588.06s -> 23604.12s]  This is a pretty good skeleton bait though. Like 160 something like that.
[23604.12s -> 23608.58s]  Gives me a pretty decent amount.
[23620.94s -> 23627.91s]  2008. Yeah. Hope you guys enjoy it. Hope you enjoy the seagull command there.
[23628.79s -> 23638.94s]  Because it's being deleted. It's being deleted. When you hit this, when you hit the year.
[23640.68s -> 23652.38s]  Two thousand bucks in four mercury. Pretty good. So I have explored that. I got the money.
[23653.02s -> 23663.90s]  Okay let's head back in here for now. Now I'm gonna take you down five gold.
[23664.86s -> 23668.95s]  Plus one spell power and uh what do I have for any people here?
[23670.15s -> 23680.34s]  Yep. Don't engage. Take the free spell. Whatever it is. Water walk. There's not
[23680.34s -> 23692.30s]  really any water here. What does it do? Walk across bodies of water. It's cool.
[23693.43s -> 23712.66s]  I'm glad I came all the way down here for that. All right. I got 8,000. City hall needs
[23712.66s -> 23723.26s]  level marketplace. Blacksmith. What else do I need here? Resource silo. One ore. I don't
[23723.26s -> 23727.82s]  really need it. Upgrade the graveyard. Darkness. All right. Black Knights.
[23730.39s -> 23743.35s]  Black Knights are now available here. Recruit some. 2012. We're almost at 2019.
[23745.22s -> 23758.18s]  And then it's gone. It's getting deleted. Here what does this have? City hall.
[23759.14s -> 23763.27s]  I need five thousand. For this to be a city hall I need a fort. I need to turn that into a
[23763.27s -> 23780.58s]  fort first. You're kind of coming in here and taking all my shit. Who's in here? Lots. Pack.
[23780.58s -> 23797.54s]  Lots. Several. This guy's dead. If he stays where he is. Someone's coming up here.
[23798.10s -> 23828.76s]  You're killable. Oh my god. Just get out of here and kill him. He's so weak. All right. I don't
[23828.76s -> 23832.44s]  want them to retreat so I need to get in a position where I can kill them both very quickly.
[23833.32s -> 23850.89s]  Don't retreat. Okay. So let me think about this. If I shoot this guy and he's dead and then
[23851.05s -> 23862.94s]  I... I'm gonna say like magic arrow should kill him or magic arrow on them. Health five. Health
[23862.94s -> 23884.10s]  ten. I'm gonna be just be sure. I'm gonna do ice bolt. Got it. What'd you have? Artifact. Magic.
[23893.48s -> 23898.12s]  That was... Tan was coming to try to take the castle because he didn't have anything.
[23899.08s -> 23903.00s]  Tan was essentially the guy out in the desert crawling in the sand.
[23904.84s -> 23916.58s]  Please. Water. Water. And I just fucking threw a dart at him. And he had magic missile on him.
[23916.58s -> 23927.75s]  Great. Well, I don't really know who's left. Purple has kind of gone up here and around.
[23927.75s -> 23941.70s]  It's red and orange. I think I can wipe you out here too. I think I can. Nobody in here.
[23942.97s -> 23949.99s]  Look at all. I got so much money. I gotta get some people in here because if he comes over,
[23950.79s -> 23967.32s]  let's collapse on him. But like, fuck you. You're not taking all this stuff. This is all mine.
[23968.52s -> 23993.61s]  There he goes. He's not going in the castle. Hurry. Hurry. I don't need to hurry. You got
[23993.61s -> 24005.69s]  20-20. Oh well. Whatever. He ain't going in there. He'll die. He's got dog shit defense.
[24005.69s -> 24017.16s]  There's a fort here, right? Yes. I think we're getting close to winning the game.
[24018.04s -> 24029.03s]  I did a lot of work this time. A lot. I was making sure I was stopping people. I was
[24029.03s -> 24035.42s]  conquering. I was attacking. Purple was just getting resources and running around in circles.
[24035.42s -> 24040.50s]  I did a lot of work this time to a point where I'm very proud of what I've been able to
[24040.50s -> 24078.34s]  accomplish here. Okay. Let's go and kill this guy. How many heads need to roll here? Can I
[24078.34s -> 24086.33s]  do it? I'm gonna be blocking the path, right? And he can't go anywhere. Get him dead. Get
[24086.33s -> 24100.81s]  him. Oh, I'm gone. Forget about these artifacts. I need to get up here and continue to win the
[24100.81s -> 24113.56s]  game. Next day. Clean this guy out. Orange still has a bunch of shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[24113.56s -> 24121.70s]  Orange is right up my front door. Where is this orange? Is Purple being destroyed?
[24128.23s -> 24147.74s]  How did you get here? What is he doing? Yeah, it's red and orange versus me and
[24147.74s -> 24155.30s]  Purple. That's who left. That's it. And he's just not doing anything. This is a decent force.
[24155.30s -> 24160.18s]  Like, what are you doing up in the snow? You need to get down here. I'm getting
[24161.22s -> 24165.78s]  swarmed by both of them at the same time. I can't kill them both. I can't do this both.
[24166.42s -> 24184.87s]  I'm gonna die here. Well, we're gonna fireball. Can I get the other one? No.
[24184.87s -> 24205.69s]  I did a lot of work this game. Even when you're on your own,
[24205.69s -> 24221.13s]  Ares still fucks you. We're supposed to be on the same damn team. That's definitely what he did
[24221.13s -> 24233.32s]  the other game, too. He's just avoiding all conflict somehow. I don't want a retreat
[24233.32s -> 24243.53s]  scenario, so let me see here. Can I kill them all quickly here? He's gonna retreat. Not
[24243.53s -> 24254.76s]  gonna be enough. Here he goes. No, he's not leaving. Let me kill you. Come on. I still
[24254.76s -> 24285.53s]  have plenty of people to do turns. Come on. I'm gonna lose this fucking castle up here.
[24286.65s -> 24300.97s]  He's gonna take it for free. Purple's just scratching his ass. No, I can't go down there
[24300.97s -> 24305.50s]  and take that. I can't. How do I get down? I gotta get down there somehow.
[24306.22s -> 24312.33s]  It's through one of these portals, I think, or through here. I didn't, like,
[24312.33s -> 24315.69s]  do anything down here. I didn't have enough money. I think this is another loss.
[24316.65s -> 24329.91s]  Did Orange take the Psyquops castle? No, he's about to. Just head in here. I gotta refill some
[24329.91s -> 24347.02s]  people. Hang out in there for a day. He's gonna take it. Where's Purple? There he is. He took
[24347.02s -> 24355.93s]  it. He just killed Purple. Purple just died. One of his guys just died. He's got nothing.
[24355.93s -> 24365.94s]  Purple is now worthless. Dude, like, can I just, like, come take these? I can't even.
[24365.94s -> 24377.53s]  Can you deliver them to me? Just deliver them to me, please. So I have a chance here. I could
[24377.53s -> 24381.78s]  probably get... What do you have for enemies? All right, here's what we're gonna do. You ready
[24381.78s -> 24397.24s]  for this? We're gonna do a little consolidation here. Who has the best... Who's the higher level?
[24399.32s -> 24407.99s]  Level nine versus level one. Yeah, just give everybody to him. Pull out some more skeleton
[24407.99s -> 24414.18s]  warriors and let's just go kill him. Let's try to kill him. Take the castle back.
[24416.71s -> 24439.61s]  He's right up here. I will win this fight. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a good idea. The
[24439.61s -> 24447.94s]  butterflies are not worth having. Let's see. Is Purple about to be deleted? And then I have
[24447.94s -> 24458.20s]  to fight versus... Is it gonna be 2v1? That's Ares right there. Where'd he go? Where's Ares?
[24458.20s -> 24502.52s]  I just saw him. Where'd he go? Where'd he go? No, that's Gem. And I'm gonna upgrade the
[24502.52s -> 24538.14s]  butchers. Just right here. Upgrade graveyard. There we go. All right, this is the force to take
[24538.78s -> 24543.42s]  the stuff back and keep everything. Hoard, hoard. He's going for this castle. He's gonna...
[24543.42s -> 24556.15s]  Let him do it. Let him go die. He actually did it. Okay, so that's weak because those were
[24557.11s -> 24564.76s]  like 10 or 15 cyclopses. Yeah, I'm gonna take the box. Give me the box. Give me the box.
[24565.64s -> 24579.22s]  Give me the box. Several lots. Give me the box. Open the box. Oh, that's 10,000 experience.
[24580.02s -> 24596.33s]  He didn't even care. All right. Expert earth magic. Expert wisdom. Expert necromancy.
[24601.35s -> 24607.80s]  Anti-magic. Should I take it? Lots, lots. Hoard packs several. I think I can do it.
[24608.36s -> 24627.51s]  I don't think this has a... I did it. I'm gonna get it. Anti-magic. Protects the select
[24627.51s -> 24635.13s]  unit from all spells. Now let's meteor shower right here. That'll hit the... It'll be good
[24635.13s -> 24642.58s]  down... Yeah, right here. It'll hit the three of it. Should kill that. Almost. Close enough.
[24643.46s -> 24656.55s]  All right, get fucking pumped up, boys and girls. Let's go. Target number one. Top and
[24656.55s -> 24687.43s]  bottom. I'm on it. Roger that. This is priority now. Wow, that did a lot of damage.
[24687.43s -> 24704.84s]  Wow! I'm so... I'm way too excited for this. You got a cool walking sound.
[24710.14s -> 24715.70s]  Really? You guys can handle that. I'm gonna say... Let's get up here.
[24718.07s -> 24723.72s]  No. They're in the back line. Get rid of this and heal that up.
[24724.60s -> 24734.55s]  Skeletons, that's fine. You don't stand a chance. All right. I am gonna fly up here.
[24734.55s -> 24751.67s]  I'm gonna take out the... I'm gonna try at least to get rid of this. Not bad. These
[24752.47s -> 24760.30s]  glitches do so much damage to the air. I own so much property over here it's kind of ridiculous.
[24761.50s -> 24787.46s]  Do some ice bolt just for fun. Let's go. Heroes of might and monopoly.
[24788.34s -> 24797.75s]  He hasn't retreated yet. He can't retreat. He's in the castle. Where are you gonna
[24797.75s -> 24826.41s]  retreat to? Now I just scared the shit out of myself. Can he run away? He didn't have anything.
[24826.41s -> 24837.67s]  Advanced offense or basic tactics? Um... offense. I got it. I got the thing and I took over the
[24837.67s -> 24842.15s]  castle. But it doesn't really matter if I've get... You need to pull some weight here.
[24844.92s -> 24852.46s]  Honest to god. You gotta start to pull weight. You're starting to get a little sloppy.
[24856.73s -> 24875.08s]  Need a marketplace. I can't do everything purple. Okay, he actually took that.
[24876.50s -> 24882.15s]  Come on. Good. This doesn't have anything. Look at how fucking shitty this is.
[24888.10s -> 24898.50s]  I need a town hall. I need a tavern. Well, might as well just get in. No, I don't even need to.
[24901.45s -> 24912.92s]  All right. Next, we're gonna do a mage guild and then I'm gonna make this a town. What
[24912.92s -> 24917.64s]  about over here? Power liches. Lots of power liches. These artifacts over here though.
[24918.44s -> 24936.95s]  I'm gonna claim some of this stuff because I don't want you to have it. Purple coming in.
[24938.39s -> 24940.71s]  Let's get this stuff back in our name.
[24946.09s -> 24955.99s]  Artifact. Amulet of the Undertaker. Lots of power liches. Build that. City hall.
[24957.77s -> 24977.99s]  More income. More income. More income. Well, I think I can definitely take them. I think
[24977.99s -> 24984.17s]  lots of liches. You're right here. You're not that strong though.
[24993.10s -> 24997.94s]  You're not gonna be able to get it with what you have here. I highly doubt that.
[25001.74s -> 25005.58s]  No, he doesn't have enough to attack. He has like, he doesn't have any people.
[25005.58s -> 25010.42s]  I could kill him with just like four black knights. All right, I'm gonna go for it.
[25011.06s -> 25023.64s]  I'm gonna go in. Power liches. 22. That's a lot, but hopefully the artifact's worth it.
[25024.28s -> 25036.62s]  What are they immune to? What do they hypnotize? Won't affect anybody.
[25036.70s -> 25059.43s]  Fireball. Meteor. Fireball is 75. I think it's still Meteor. Forgetfulness. Half of the selected
[25059.43s -> 25064.95s]  enemy unit forgets to use their ranged attack. You can't do it. I'm just going for damage.
[25068.47s -> 25089.29s]  This is ranged, so we're just gonna get in. Blind makes him unable to move. This is already
[25089.29s -> 25094.49s]  not off to a great start, but I hope that artifact is worth getting. Good. Let's go with
[25115.83s -> 25121.14s]  another. Let's go to Fireball. Meteor. I'm gonna go back in the house anyways.
[25121.78s -> 25139.88s]  Just do a bunch of damage. I'm gonna lose a lot, but it's okay. We're almost actually at the end
[25139.88s -> 25156.18s]  game, I think, here. What is it? Amulet of the Undertaker and the Golden Bow. All right. What
[25156.18s -> 25161.45s]  about the neck? This amulet increases your necromancy skill by five percent. And then the
[25162.41s -> 25169.43s]  That's not that great. That's all right, I guess. He's not going to attack.
[25170.15s -> 25175.48s]  They're just so all over the place. I'm gonna lose because Purple's not fucking doing anything.
[25176.60s -> 25182.18s]  Purple, they're all over here. What are you still doing up there, Purple?
[25183.54s -> 25207.59s]  Just get over here. That's actually incredible. That's fantastic, actually.
[25208.31s -> 25224.15s]  Let's get back in here. All right. Did I do this? This is done. Capital. Cannot build a capital yet.
[25224.15s -> 25239.59s]  I have... I need a capital. What should I make the capital? Probably this. Yeah.
[25246.09s -> 25250.79s]  Ten thousand gold? That's the capital. I need a mage tower.
[25262.95s -> 25278.02s]  Don't come over here. Soon 20 bone dragons. It's possible. Purple has entered the server.
[25279.58s -> 25290.06s]  Here he is. Oh, great. You have five dwarves, nine riders, and 47, like, dirty, like,
[25290.86s -> 25303.59s]  peasant people with pitchforks. Does anybody... You have to have a hero that has something,
[25303.59s -> 25309.53s]  right? That's who you send all the way over here. He's probably coming over to look for
[25309.53s -> 25316.97s]  food. Hey, we're on the same team. Could I like bum a couple of cigarettes off you?
[25318.25s -> 25332.04s]  Oh, get out of here. Okay, see you later, man. This sucks. I'm just gonna bring him down here.
[25332.84s -> 25344.18s]  It's almost like I should build this up. Cliff nest, I guess. I'm gonna just build...
[25344.18s -> 25349.58s]  Let's build some of this. I can do the citadel, the capital up here in a minute.
[25352.90s -> 25356.34s]  Imagine blaming your team in a single player game. Well, they haven't... He hasn't done
[25356.34s -> 25363.64s]  anything. He's just died. He's supposed to be really good. Oh, you took a castle.
[25364.36s -> 25376.44s]  Good job. Take that one too. Which castles did you take? That's default enemies. Why is it...
[25385.16s -> 25394.89s]  He's still got, like, default enemies. When I'm playing against him, he's impossible to overcome.
[25394.89s -> 25403.45s]  When I play with him, he's still using default fucking vampires. I mean, I'm just so fucking
[25403.45s -> 25410.26s]  upset about this. I'm so upset about these things. Well, it's time just to stockpile.
[25410.90s -> 25433.35s]  Upgrade you guys. Not bad. I was supposed to turn this into a
[25433.91s -> 25450.28s]  capital. See you next week. Good job. You did great. I'm very proud of you. You just...
[25450.28s -> 25454.74s]  Nice work. I can't wait to get the inevitable purple has been deleted from the server.
[25455.46s -> 25469.96s]  Gremlin population's double. It's all over the place now? Okay. 4500. I need to start
[25469.96s -> 25476.79s]  making other stuff too, though. I need, like, a hall of darkness. I need a capital building!
[25477.67s -> 25490.49s]  I'm going in here. When was the last time I saved the game? Oh my god, what am I doing?
[25491.21s -> 25502.79s]  I'm so upset. I did not... I, for some reason, I don't... I didn't... What the fuck did I do
[25502.79s -> 25510.47s]  that for? It's okay. I can still do this. Health. They don't have very much health.
[25514.26s -> 25527.72s]  I am going to bloodlust. I don't have bloodlust. Hypnotize. That's not going to affect anybody?
[25532.86s -> 25545.83s]  Holy shit. Hayden Clipfell just gave $115. Thank you so much for the 115 bucks. That's a
[25545.83s -> 25557.27s]  ton of fucking money. Uh, they say hello, good night. Thank you. That's an insane amount
[25557.27s -> 25577.61s]  of money. Thank you so much. Thank you for the fucking 115. It's not as scary as I thought
[25577.61s -> 25585.66s]  it was going to be. Let's collapse on the... Go forward. Yeah, this is not bad. This is going
[25585.66s -> 25590.54s]  to be fine. I was scared for a second. I don't know why. I just... I keep thinking
[25590.54s -> 25595.58s]  they're like dragons, but they're not. Uh, let's go up here.
[25601.64s -> 25610.06s]  Just griffins. These two can handle it.
[25610.06s -> 25630.54s]  15, 13. There. And this is probably going to be it. I probably build a, uh,
[25632.06s -> 25648.60s]  have a griffins now, right? That's a good amount of experience. Expert offense of basic fire.
[25649.56s -> 25659.13s]  I think expert offense. Having defeated the royal griffins, you just got three angels.
[25661.78s -> 25674.90s]  Oh damn. I think I'm... Give up the basic skeletons. I wish I could just... The whites
[25675.62s -> 25710.60s]  with the zombies. Two to three, 20 health. Three to five. Yeah. Two to three, 20, five, five.
[25711.82s -> 25725.35s]  Yeah, the zombies are worse. Can they just stay there? That's a big waste. Uh, but that... I
[25725.35s -> 25734.89s]  mean, this is a really big, powerful enemy. 200 health. Three of them. I can get the zombies
[25734.89s -> 25755.83s]  back. You see, I can get them back. Citadel. Don't do that. Angels are worth like 9k,
[25755.83s -> 25762.28s]  42 zombies are worth like five and a half k. Yeah. Angels are a little out of place for this army.
[25762.28s -> 25768.94s]  They'll be fine. And have you ever heard of like a shadow priest? We're gonna be just fine.
[25768.94s -> 25793.00s]  We're gonna win. Can do the market. Market. I need a capital. Give me... Let me get the
[25793.00s -> 25813.10s]  capital first. It's just me against the world. Let me get a good look at your army. It's not
[25813.10s -> 25848.42s]  that great. Armies really not that good. 8,500. Starting to lose the long game here. Just don't
[25848.42s -> 25856.74s]  have enough money. Low morale ogres. I need to get out of the castle and just fucking...
[25857.86s -> 25874.87s]  I need to start claiming shit back. This is my stuff. Capital. I'll get a note.
[25874.87s -> 25903.78s]  Make this the capital and then I'm good to go. I got... No, I'm gonna stack. This is the guy
[25903.78s -> 25912.09s]  that's gonna win. This is my mobile destructive unit. Oh, fuck. He's going for the other
[25912.09s -> 25920.07s]  castle. Hey, you could blame this on me. But then I would blame this on Purple. And then
[25920.07s -> 25951.86s]  Purple would blame it on nothing because he's not a person. He's not alive. Almost done.
[25952.50s -> 25963.93s]  What do we got? Anybody near me? You're down here. I can defend this. This is gonna get this.
[25963.93s -> 25987.38s]  I have a fort. I'm gonna sell some shit. I'm gonna at least have something here. Let's get
[25987.94s -> 25999.45s]  some rocks. Nah, maybe you'll think twice. I bet you walk up the stairs one at a time.
[25999.45s -> 26012.68s]  I'm sorry, but you need to be incorrect on that one. I'm gonna sell some more stuff.
[26013.56s -> 26044.79s]  I mean, I have lost every time, but I've had a lot of fun doing it. I will say I've had a lot of
[26044.79s -> 26056.52s]  fun doing it. They're just stationing out here. They don't have very much that I could get rid
[26056.52s -> 26062.71s]  of both of them. Lots, lots. Pack. They're just very spread out. I just need somebody to help
[26062.71s -> 26079.30s]  me here. You're not gonna take this. Not even close. It's not gonna happen. I've got
[26079.30s -> 26092.44s]  like an absurd army here. All right, this is the last week. And now I'm gonna go and go
[26092.44s -> 26111.08s]  for the kill over here. I'm gonna try to take the capital back up here. First, I want to do this.
[26112.04s -> 26135.70s]  Better death knights. I can't do it. One more week and then I'm out. I'm gone. And then I'm
[26135.70s -> 26142.23s]  gonna just walk. I'm gonna just chase people down and kill them. I'm turning into a hoarder.
[26143.11s -> 26159.14s]  There's two people surrounding his castle. Here we go. Much better. Dread knights. I
[26159.14s -> 26165.59s]  can get some more of these. I can get some more skeletons. All right, I'm actually,
[26165.59s -> 26171.21s]  I'm gonna leave now. I'm gonna bring the fairies too because I just want them to be bait.
[26173.45s -> 26185.22s]  Let's take the kingdom back one at a time here. You down here, I want you to come out.
[26185.78s -> 26214.04s]  A throng of swordsmen. Let's get over here. Get bone dragons or I will be mildly disappointed.
[26214.04s -> 26221.40s]  Don't worry, you won't be disappointed. Well, you may be, you will. Because I might not get
[26222.20s -> 26253.22s]  not enough. Ha ha. That's not enough. Rock. Some tree back. I can't swing. That was a mistake.
[26253.22s -> 26263.14s]  I can't, well I guess I'm gonna get the dog. I guess about the dwarf. Just get in there and
[26263.14s -> 26288.36s]  maybe he'll swing at you. 21, 18, 60 versus 18. Five. Everyone's surrounding you. I can't get
[26288.36s -> 26304.06s]  in there. I guess you level them up. This is of course like combat he's seen. Basic scholar.
[26304.06s -> 26322.25s]  Basic heir. Probably heir. Can't fire here. We'll get that later. I'm out for blood right now.
[26322.25s -> 26329.56s]  Like pure total hatred and vengeance I'm going for. All their armors are not as good as mine.
[26330.20s -> 26334.76s]  They're not as cool as mine. They're not as like, handsome as my characters. They're not
[26334.76s -> 26361.53s]  as smart as my characters. I don't even, I'm not gonna use a spell that's not even
[26361.53s -> 26376.12s]  worth, why would I do that? It's unnecessary. You'll die in one hit. There's no, I don't
[26376.12s -> 26383.56s]  even need to do that. All right. Claimed. Again. It's been claimed. Now we're gonna go up.
[26384.36s -> 26391.56s]  Several, several, several. What about over here? Several. Right up here. Lots, horde, lots,
[26391.56s -> 26414.12s]  throng, horde. We just gotta go straight up. It's now a fort. You. Six of our gold. Can you
[26414.12s -> 26433.24s]  handle this? A throng of swordsmen. I don't think you can. Okay, okay. What else am I
[26433.24s -> 26441.59s]  gonna do? I want a mage tower. Cover up darkness. No. Convert any creature into a skeleton.
[26451.27s -> 26455.69s]  Firebirds. No. Just hang out here because they're gonna come back.
[26456.49s -> 26474.18s]  Just convert everybody to skeletons. That'd be insane. Yeah, tomorrow's gonna suck. I'm
[26474.18s -> 26479.43s]  not looking forward to tomorrow at all because I have to do the prep tomorrow
[26480.49s -> 26488.63s]  and it's absolutely unbearable. It's not gonna be fun. So that's why you're not gonna see
[26488.63s -> 26495.74s]  me for like a few days. So I got the prep tomorrow. I've got the procedure the next day and then I'm
[26495.74s -> 26498.70s]  probably gonna take another day after that because I'm gonna be on a bunch of drugs today
[26498.70s -> 26516.46s]  that day before. Depending. We'll see. I'll keep you updated. Bye. How you doing? You good?
[26517.99s -> 26521.91s]  I mean you might as well just take an extra one. You've been in here for a day. Let's go.
[26523.10s -> 26539.78s]  Phew. Throng, several, lots, lots. This is gonna be a tough one. It's got dragons though.
[26540.50s -> 26567.26s]  Let's get a throng. I think I can do it. Oh, let's go. He only has one dragon.
[26568.22s -> 26578.06s]  That's fine with me. I'm gonna kill this one dragon right now with, oh man,
[26578.06s -> 26581.74s]  Meteor Shower right here. And I'm gonna kill, watch this. Meteor Shower right in the middle.
[26582.46s -> 26593.61s]  That was unbelievable. Then I can kill you with her. That was as perfect as it could have
[26593.61s -> 26607.34s]  been. Retaliate. I want you. Yeah, the knights go this way. Take out the Mance Core. Perfect.
[26607.34s -> 26618.30s]  Both their strongest units are dead. Just go be bait up here. Perfect. And I'm gonna have you
[26619.26s -> 26636.86s]  get down this way. Take out the air. He fled. Damn it. Damn it. What about you,
[26636.86s -> 26645.91s]  motherfucker? I'm coming for you. I'm going in that portal. I'm going in the fucking portal.
[26645.91s -> 26656.46s]  I'm gonna go kill them. Check this out. I'm going straight in that portal. You think you can run
[26656.46s -> 26675.45s]  from me? You can't run from me. I'm gonna go take out Red. Hey, be right back. I'm gonna
[26675.45s -> 26697.50s]  go kill Red and wipe him off the map. Head back in there. Let's keep you upgrading.
[26698.22s -> 26708.02s]  I'll do here, Citadel. Okay, you're starting to stack up a little.
[26708.66s -> 26719.50s]  I'm gonna kill Red. And then it's the two of us versus Orange. We can handle it together.
[26720.22s -> 26730.33s]  We can do this together. I just have to do my thing down here. Red does not have another base,
[26730.33s -> 26748.04s]  I don't think. I think this is it. I could go up and just remove him. Yep, we're taking
[26748.04s -> 26761.67s]  him out one by one. I want them to be... I want nobody to exist. I'm not gonna use any
[26761.67s -> 26779.32s]  spells that I need to. This is pathetic. Just get in here. Even if they attack first,
[26780.65s -> 26796.81s]  it doesn't matter. I can retaliate and kill them. I've got the burning of a thousand suns in my
[26796.81s -> 26825.67s]  blood. I'm going to win this systematically slowly. Yeah, bye. No. This is actually pretty
[26825.67s -> 26860.78s]  hard to win because my shit-stained partner is not doing so well. He's doing the best he can.
[26861.34s -> 26866.62s]  Yes, but it's gonna be another scenario where I don't... Wait a minute, he just killed somebody.
[26867.42s -> 26893.56s]  Here we go. I'm gonna Meteor Shower right here. That's gonna fuck them all up. Beautiful. Now
[26893.56s -> 26907.59s]  let's go on the bottom here with the angel. That was a mistake. That was what I wanted to
[26907.59s -> 26935.03s]  do, so thanks for doing that. Please. Minimal casualties too. I'll at least go out taking
[26935.99s -> 26955.26s]  out red and that's all I care about. I'm going in here. I'm going to give bloodlust
[26956.54s -> 26978.97s]  and you're gonna fly in and just kill this right now. What's left? What the hell is left?
[26980.01s -> 27009.35s]  We're still alive. Okay, I didn't lose anything. Sorcery or ballistics. I think it's gonna be
[27009.35s -> 27025.45s]  ballistics here. Thanks for the castle. I got 53 more skeletons. Oh, I didn't want to do that.
[27026.41s -> 27033.08s]  I think that's their only castle. They have seven turns to come and get me.
[27035.51s -> 27061.67s]  Good luck. Well, they could try to take this one. Let's see what happens. No,
[27061.67s -> 27069.38s]  red has one more up here. You got three... You can get that. Three bone dragons.
[27070.18s -> 27076.79s]  They have one more stronghold right there. Hold on a minute. Let me just like fucking
[27077.11s -> 27084.49s]  park for a second and like sap you of all your energy. Is this a... Is this a citadel?
[27084.49s -> 27101.58s]  It's a good castle. Resource silo mana vortex. Oh yeah, give me that. Park here for now.
[27102.30s -> 27117.88s]  I think I can do this. I wonder if I can come out here and just kill him.
[27118.92s -> 27169.18s]  Few, few, few. I gotta send the rock down here. Comes. Take him out.
[27169.18s -> 27182.28s]  No. Come on. Whack him. Whack him. Another hero done. I wonder if you will retreat.
[27183.00s -> 27206.66s]  I hope you don't. I think you can still win. Delusional. Fucking delusional.
[27222.68s -> 27229.42s]  Dead. And I got lightning bolt. We didn't have anything?
[27232.18s -> 27234.50s]  Advanced air magic allows you here to cast air spells that reduce cost.
[27235.46s -> 27249.29s]  Air magic. Let's get back in here. Rest up. I bought everything I can buy here.
[27249.29s -> 27253.77s]  I might take you out and send you somewhere, but maybe not yet. This is unguarded.
[27254.33s -> 27278.18s]  Protect purple? I mean, where's purple? Purple has one more place. Nothing in it.
[27278.18s -> 27286.71s]  He has default enemies in here. I'm gonna lose, but I mean maybe I could at least look
[27287.27s -> 27305.02s]  pretty good doing it, you know? If I can stack a ton of people, it might be... Of course you just
[27305.02s -> 27328.14s]  leave. Purple? Thanks. Oh, would you know? You would appreciate some gold. Is that what
[27328.14s -> 27343.34s]  you'd want? He actually just came in and asked for a cigarette. What the hell are you
[27343.34s -> 27352.89s]  gonna spend it on? No, I'm stacking somebody, man. Dragon vault. It's done.
[27354.95s -> 27359.51s]  I'm gonna have two stacks. I just got a stacker like the BK stacker. He's dead.
[27370.49s -> 27396.12s]  I'm gonna be so hungry. I'm gonna be so hungry. What time is it? 11? Because I can't eat any food
[27396.12s -> 27410.18s]  as of tomorrow. He tried to give me his rocks. I don't want his rocks. I want his support
[27410.18s -> 27418.36s]  and his fighting power and his help. Yeah, colonoscopy is on Saturday, so
[27419.50s -> 27425.50s]  I can't eat any food a day before and it's in the morning. So I have the... My like
[27425.50s -> 27435.61s]  last meal is gonna be tonight. So I actually have to go here soon within the next like 40 minutes
[27435.61s -> 27451.86s]  because I need to be able to eat something before tomorrow, but I'm not out yet. I can't.
[27456.46s -> 27491.53s]  Bone dragon. I just need 15 grand. I'm gonna sell some stuff. No, I don't need to. More.
[27494.66s -> 27500.60s]  I don't need to have the super bone dragons. Three regular bone dragons is good
[27501.48s -> 27519.88s]  because guess who I'm sending back up there? Me. I'd wrap around this way. Horde. Several pack few.
[27520.84s -> 27530.97s]  I don't know if I want to fight this. Give me this castle.
[27550.66s -> 27569.61s]  Fuck the resources. Just trying to get bone dragons. He just got the pandora's box. That's
[27569.61s -> 27578.09s]  not good. See, I'm getting encroachment here. Take that red castle right now.
[27579.77s -> 27618.98s]  Get this red castle. You keep coming over here. Down here. Do I have earthquake? I have meteor
[27618.98s -> 27624.66s]  shower. I also have clone. There's a duplicate of the selected unit stack. The image is dispelled
[27624.66s -> 27637.94s]  if it is attacked. Oh, that's more like a fire. Armageddon. Brains fire down upon the battlefield
[27637.94s -> 27644.92s]  damaging all units. I don't think I want to hurt everybody. That's not it's not time for
[27644.92s -> 27658.63s]  Armageddon. Meteor shower. Get this stack right in the middle. I'm gonna kill myself with
[27658.63s -> 27665.59s]  Armageddon. Can't get rid of it yet. He might come up and meet me in the middle with this dragon he
[27665.59s -> 27696.38s]  will. End it. Perfect. Now they have one ranged. There we go. These are just regular vampires.
[27696.38s -> 27702.60s]  There's nothing to be afraid of. Get units that are not affected by magic and use it.
[27703.32s -> 27710.28s]  I mean that's we're at the end game here. I'm trying to cycle back around to load up
[27710.28s -> 27715.37s]  again on units and then have like an unstoppable force and just run around the
[27715.37s -> 27752.42s]  whole map and kill everyone. In here. Locked in. The castle is ours. Inexhaustible cart
[27752.42s -> 27755.86s]  of oro. When equipped this cart provides you with an additional one ore per day.
[27756.90s -> 27767.48s]  And I got dispelled. Advanced ballistics. Yeah. Thank you for the castle. Too bad you don't
[27767.48s -> 27772.04s]  have any goddamn bone dragons in here. Are these advanced bone dragons or are these regular
[27772.04s -> 27786.42s]  bone dragons? All right. Hold on. Now I wrap up. Let's go this way then. I got two of these
[27786.42s -> 27801.78s]  castles. I'm going this way. I'll take you all out. I can't waste any time here. Purple's
[27801.78s -> 27809.14s]  right here with three dwarves. Forget about the resources. I just have to go. I've got a
[27809.14s -> 27831.70s]  great army. No one's taking this shit back from me. All right. You want to try? You really
[27831.78s -> 27855.85s]  want to try this? Slow. Blind. Blind. To you. On the rocks. Can't do it on the bird.
[27859.30s -> 27878.94s]  Now that he can't move now. He's not gonna get it. He's fucked. Damn it. That wasn't it.
[27879.82s -> 27906.15s]  That sucks. That's all they got though. This is not that intimidating. I mean they'll
[27906.15s -> 27914.52s]  breach eventually here. I can't do it anymore. I can only. That's it. I can't do it anymore.
[27915.40s -> 27921.90s]  Back up this way so people don't get stuffed in the corner. All right. I think I'm flying
[27921.90s -> 27944.73s]  the dragon over. No. No. I don't think so. Yeah. I got. I'm just gonna use ranged on.
[27946.57s -> 27953.14s]  Just get rid of. The towers are taking care of you. On the air. It does a ton of damage to
[27953.14s -> 27962.57s]  the air. Oh that hurts. I think it's not. I gotta get out. I can't just sit here all day.
[27962.57s -> 27968.95s]  He's gonna do that again. Is that the prison that happened to the unicorn? No.
[27972.34s -> 27991.02s]  They can't get in. They're getting hurt by the spikes. I'm gonna kill him eventually here.
[27991.02s -> 28010.22s]  Maybe one more. All right. Gates are gonna be breached. Not quite. No. They're gonna
[28010.22s -> 28027.29s]  just keep hurting themselves. What the fuck just happened? What was that? Destroy undead?
[28028.76s -> 28057.10s]  You are undead. Hold. Just hold. Hold. Is it open? I don't think it's open yet.
[28066.71s -> 28102.30s]  It is open. Isn't it? Hold the wall. Hold the wall. Hold the wall. Hold the wall. Hold the wall.
[28104.70s -> 28121.16s]  Hold the wall. Oh my god. This can't be. I should have just went out. I didn't think
[28121.16s -> 28126.87s]  he was gonna be. It's over. I lost. I did it fucking twice. I just lost. I can't believe it.
[28126.87s -> 28130.79s]  I should have just ran out and not held. That's what I should have done.
[28131.75s -> 28137.62s]  That's what I should have done. I should have just fucking left and got out and started attacking.
[28138.26s -> 28146.65s]  And everybody would have screamed at me if I went out. But you see what happens?
[28147.61s -> 28182.52s]  I would have won. Did I save? Well, it doesn't matter. Orange has the entire map.
[28182.52s -> 28186.63s]  Purple was fucking walking in circles for the first two hours of the game.
[28188.79s -> 28220.66s]  I just lose. I'm supposed to retreat. I don't have armor getting on this guy.
[28220.66s -> 28258.71s]  It's a different character. Save scum? No. I actually have to leave here. I have to
[28258.95s -> 28265.88s]  clean this up and get out of here. Because I am going to severely fuck up the next three
[28265.88s -> 28280.04s]  days if I do not. If I don't eat before 1230, one o'clock in the morning tonight,
[28284.44s -> 28301.34s]  I might actually starve. That would not be a good thing. He's got so many, but I still
[28301.34s -> 28306.89s]  might be able to. Is there anything else up here? I got that one. Purple's is there. That's mine.
[28306.89s -> 28318.70s]  That's his now. I'm going to try to take this. I've got a lot of money. So here,
[28318.70s -> 28325.67s]  let's stock up on you. There's like nobody even in here. It's kind of a lost cause at
[28325.67s -> 28331.40s]  the moment, to be honest. Spend some money. Make this the new fucking capital.
[28332.36s -> 28363.02s]  Got a new hero in there too. He just came into my house. Does he even have one left? He's like,
[28363.02s -> 28369.34s]  I guess I'll stop in yours. That sounds fun. All right. This is like the big fight here
[28369.34s -> 28390.15s]  because this is going to be it. This is going to be the one. We got, okay, who's back there?
[28391.77s -> 28399.02s]  Meteor Shower. They've really bunched up right here. That didn't hit the,
[28399.66s -> 28409.61s]  did not hit you. That's weird. Did I just break it? I think I might've just broken it.
[28414.39s -> 28426.04s]  Magic resistance. What was that? Air shield. My priority is going to be the archers here.
[28426.04s -> 28431.67s]  Let's fly up this way. And you're going to have to eventually get down here.
[28432.63s -> 28443.99s]  Yeah, that's not good. We got to get in there. That was a pretty big hit.
[28456.97s -> 28464.04s]  Front door, huh? All right. Well, okay. I really want to fight. I want to bring the whole
[28464.04s -> 28485.48s]  fight. Same deal down here. Double it up. Nice. Perfect. It's open. I want bloodlust on you.
[28496.76s -> 28502.60s]  That was a huge heal. All right, you take out this last one here. Let's get everybody
[28502.60s -> 28515.32s]  into the wall now. Get right up in there. We should be able to get this last hit.
[28517.70s -> 28522.63s]  You walked right into the 224 skeletons. That was a bad idea.
[28523.43s -> 28542.98s]  What's that? He teleports the people? Leave the dwarves alone. Oh, poor dwarf. Batters,
[28542.98s -> 28553.66s]  it's already open. He killed that. All right. Dwarves, we're going to now have to deal with
[28553.66s -> 28565.22s]  this. I want to do second of the lightning bolt, anti-magic, landmine, ice bolt. I'm
[28565.22s -> 28574.60s]  probably just going to do fireball up here. Are you magic resistant? Yeah. Aura of magic
[28574.60s -> 28582.04s]  resistance. It might be just lightning bolt. I don't know why I just did that.
[28585.96s -> 28601.86s]  I just went Australian for a minute. I think you're the threat here. Centaurs.
[28603.86s -> 28628.78s]  Should be good to go. I don't go after the unicorn yet. Good. There's the unicorn.
[28629.58s -> 28633.66s]  Walking to the path is the... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28638.62s -> 28664.30s]  Seven of you. Get out of my way. Suicide dwarves. Pretty good battle.
[28667.40s -> 28700.71s]  Seagulls are growing stronger. All right, I'm going to get this castle. Sword of Hellfire.
[28701.59s -> 28711.67s]  This right-hand weapon increases your attack skill by plus six and sacrifice. Holy shit.
[28711.67s -> 28728.97s]  What a sacrifice. Who cares about the one oar? Lightning bolt. No, I don't care about the oar.
[28729.93s -> 28743.46s]  All right. What does this do? Sacrifice. Destroys a friendly creature group in order
[28743.46s -> 28746.98s]  to resurrect a dead group. Number of resurrected creatures depends on the
[28746.98s -> 28756.47s]  caster's spell power and the health of destroyed stack. Jesus. All right. This was
[28756.47s -> 28776.07s]  a big deal. There's no more towns up here. Are you going to get this?
[28780.25s -> 28787.61s]  Go get it. Go get that town. That's Red's last town. Please just go get it and eliminate Red.
[28790.97s -> 28795.05s]  Oh my god. You are so dumb. Why is the computer so dumb on my team?
[28795.85s -> 28808.87s]  Can I make you do that? Oh my god. What have you done?
[28832.22s -> 28839.00s]  Unfortunately, I have to go. I got to get out of here, guys. I'm sorry. I have to eat
[28839.00s -> 28852.42s]  something before it becomes too late. So you will see me. Oh, I want to just play. I have to eat.
[28853.99s -> 28862.06s]  Eat and stream at the same time. All right. Hold on. I'll be right back.
[28862.62s -> 28864.84s]  I'm going to get something quick. I'll be right back.
[29072.70s -> 29140.68s]  I'm back. I've got bread. I've just gotten white bread. That's all I can eat. I'm addicted.
[29140.68s -> 29143.16s]  I'm just addicted. And that's what I fucking do about it.
[29152.30s -> 29159.42s]  I'm addicted to the game. I'm addicted to bread. I can't stop eating. I eat a loaf every hour.
[29160.06s -> 29166.71s]  I just can't help it. I dunked the bread in the water so I can just like slurp it down.
[29166.71s -> 29191.54s]  It's fucked up. All right. I'm going for it. Holy shit. There's a fucking lot of stuff. Yeah.
[29215.80s -> 29220.74s]  I'm going to do it. He's going to do it. I don't need any help from anybody.
[29237.77s -> 29298.28s]  You're eating soggy bread like a duck. I'm dead. I'm addicted to bread. I can't help it.
[29298.28s -> 29336.63s]  I need to eat more bread. Dragon! I hate this unit. I just think it's ugly.
[29337.43s -> 29389.40s]  Whatever. Do you eat the first and last slice of bread? Yes, I do.
[29393.94s -> 29400.90s]  Why do people not eat those? I don't get it. Why would you not eat the first and last slice
[29400.90s -> 29412.44s]  of bread? It's just, it's bread. There's nothing wrong with it. What do you throw it away?
[29413.24s -> 29419.29s]  If you throw away, okay, if you throw the first and whatever, I'm dead. Who cares?
[29419.29s -> 29429.06s]  If you throw away the first and last piece of bread on every loaf, you took the castle.
[29450.34s -> 29474.95s]  This shit's like winnable. I think. Hold on. I have to like go to bed.
[29478.94s -> 29487.40s]  One more big battle and I have to get out of here. I really do. I'm too addicted. It's too
[29487.40s -> 29510.57s]  much fun. I was going to just eat. Eat real food before you sleep. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I'm
[29510.57s -> 29515.66s]  going to regret it. I know. Yeah. All right, guys. I have to do the responsible thing. I
[29515.66s -> 29520.82s]  really do. I'm going to be feeling this in like a couple of days and I'm going to be
[29520.82s -> 29528.73s]  really upset. I have to, I have to prep for my fucking colonoscopy. I have to do this.
[29528.73s -> 29532.49s]  This is like, I don't want to leave, but I have to. I really have to.
[29547.98s -> 29571.03s]  Two more rounds. Nobody there. There's nobody here either. There's nobody fucking here.
[29575.24s -> 29589.13s]  Go get this one for free. Swarm of those. I have to go back into that thing.
[29589.85s -> 29611.64s]  What is that portal? What the fuck? That was stupid. All right. I'm going to save it here.
[29613.62s -> 29623.14s]  Game is saved. Thank you for watching. I wish I could go more, but I have to go take care
[29623.14s -> 29629.86s]  of some things. There's some specific things I have to get ready for. I have to go eat
[29629.86s -> 29633.06s]  something more substantial. I have to go make something. I don't have anything ready to eat
[29634.02s -> 29641.43s]  tomorrow morning all the way through into Saturday. I have to take these super laxatives.
[29641.43s -> 29646.71s]  I need to be prepared for this. I got to go like get ready. Thank you everybody for watching. I
[29646.71s -> 29652.34s]  hope you had fun. This game is really fucking fun and addicting. I'll probably do it again.
[29652.34s -> 29658.23s]  We'll probably complete that one and then move on to another game. It's probably what will
[29658.23s -> 29668.44s]  happen. The next time you will see me will probably be on Sunday or either Sunday or
[29668.44s -> 29673.99s]  Monday maybe. One, two, yeah. I would assume you'll probably see me on Monday.
[29676.70s -> 29680.70s]  Wish me luck. I'm a little nervous. I actually am. I am a little nervous
[29682.23s -> 29685.11s]  just because there's a couple of reasons why. There's a couple of things.
[29687.03s -> 29692.55s]  You know, you have to go get put under. It takes like 30 minutes of them going all inside
[29692.55s -> 29698.55s]  of your body and your guts and shit. I've done something similar like it before.
[29703.00s -> 29707.13s]  Thanks everybody for watching. We actually don't have very many bits so this is not
[29707.13s -> 29709.77s]  going to take very long. I'm going to go through them right now. We're not going to
[29709.77s -> 29717.90s]  take any time. We had eight hours ago. God, these might and magic streams are just so long.
[29719.24s -> 29723.75s]  Thank you. Jerma lied about Taco Bell for the 250. If you need some energy, Jerma,
[29723.75s -> 29727.99s]  just eat a Gordita Crunchwrap Deluxe from Taco Bell. I'm just kidding around, Jerma.
[29727.99s -> 29732.23s]  I know there's a really high morality with this kind of procedure so I hope you know
[29732.23s -> 29738.78s]  we're all pulling for you on this one. Yeah, I'm just going in to get a couple
[29738.78s -> 29743.88s]  things looked at. Eating Taco Bell before colonoscopy. I would have to reschedule it.
[29746.10s -> 29751.86s]  There are certain, imagine, what did you eat yesterday? Oh, I had some water,
[29752.66s -> 29758.04s]  three cheesy Gordita Crunches, and two Big Macs. Okay, well come back in like,
[29758.04s -> 29765.26s]  come back next week and don't do that again. But thank you so much. Thank you Epoxy. 47
[29765.26s -> 29772.10s]  dollars from Epoxy. This was way earlier in the stream. I didn't catch it. It was 47
[29772.10s -> 29778.31s]  fucking dollars. Just shy of 50 bucks. It's a lot. Hey Jerma, today's my brother's birthday
[29778.31s -> 29781.51s]  and him and I both love your content and meet a lot of you wished him happy birthday.
[29784.01s -> 29791.75s]  Absolutely. I don't know what your brother's name is but happy birthday Epoxy's brother.
[29791.75s -> 29795.59s]  Hopefully it's still your birthday and if it's not then happy birthday after your birthday.
[29795.59s -> 29804.10s]  You deserve, you should get two birthdays. Thank you so much Epoxy if you're still here
[29804.10s -> 29808.18s]  and happy birthday to your brother. Hope you guys had a good day. Hope you had a lot of
[29808.18s -> 29815.06s]  fun. Hope you got him something nice. Hope you got him something nice. Thank you for the 47
[29815.06s -> 29821.14s]  dollars. I really appreciate it. Freudian weapon thanks for the 250. Good luck with the procedure.
[29821.14s -> 29826.97s]  Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. I get weirdly nervous before procedures and then
[29826.97s -> 29832.01s]  it's weird because I two days before the procedure I'm like really nervous and then
[29832.01s -> 29836.49s]  when I get in the doctor's office I'm like I don't care whatever. It's just like the two
[29836.49s -> 29843.18s]  days before but thank you. Spicy Pepe thanks for the 250. Hey Jerma, I hope you're doing
[29843.18s -> 29847.50s]  well. The streams have been great. I have really enjoyed them. I still think you're the best human
[29847.50s -> 29851.66s]  and if chat wants to disagree with me on that just remember it's okay to be incorrect chat.
[29853.45s -> 29857.21s]  Thank you. One question. Will you be streaming this year's E3 like you did last year?
[29857.77s -> 29864.33s]  Hope the colonoscopy goes smoothly and your couple days to relax go well. Yes if I'm not
[29864.33s -> 29868.33s]  at E3 I just I don't have any plans to be but we might last minute decide that we're
[29868.33s -> 29874.73s]  gonna go. If not then I will do an E3 breakdown stream. You will get it. I will do those streams
[29874.73s -> 29885.91s]  again. They were fun. You will get it again. Thank you so much for the 250. Smelly Boy thanks
[29885.91s -> 29889.03s]  for 250. If you were able to have this much fun playing a game like this Civilization is a
[29889.03s -> 29898.10s]  total totally a viable game of choice. Civ 5 or 6? I feel like Civilization is a little
[29898.10s -> 29904.42s]  more complicated than this. Am I wrong in that? Is Civ 4 or Civ 5? Aren't they a little
[29904.42s -> 29911.90s]  more? They take a lot longer and they're a little more complicated. Can't a Civilization game last
[29911.90s -> 29923.45s]  like 50 hours? 5 is super easy. Heroes of Might and Magic's a little more chill.
[29926.49s -> 29931.45s]  Yeah I think it's just I have this predisposed bias just because of how much I love these games
[29931.45s -> 29936.55s]  and how much when I was like a young kind of teenager I played them. The game came out
[29936.55s -> 29941.14s]  I think when I was like 14 or 15 or something and I played the other ones before too. I
[29941.14s -> 29945.43s]  played Heroes of Might and Magic 2. There's a lot of them. There's like seven of them
[29946.33s -> 29955.05s]  and three is really the best one by a general consensus. Three is the best one by a margin
[29955.05s -> 29964.94s]  I think. That was 14 yeah? Yep. I love it. I think it's great but Civilization maybe. I
[29964.94s -> 29968.38s]  don't know. Probably not though. I don't think it's that kind of game that I would like to
[29968.38s -> 29976.41s]  play. Neither was this but I'm biased. Also 250 from Era Paradox. Goodbye and good morning
[29976.89s -> 29985.77s]  and goodbye to you too. Thank you for the 250. Let's get those credits rolling. Thank you to all
[29985.77s -> 29990.89s]  the subs. All the shit load of you that support this stream every single time. You guys are
[29990.89s -> 29998.41s]  fucking incredible. Thank you everybody. You guys rock. I know these last couple streams have been
[29998.41s -> 30005.53s]  a little more kind of longer and more about like kind of video game and chiller and not
[30005.53s -> 30012.49s]  like a whole bunch of crazy stuff going on but I hope you liked it. I loved it and I'll
[30012.49s -> 30019.86s]  see you guys real soon. Thank you so much for your subscriptions. Fred Flintstone. I just
[30019.86s -> 30028.87s]  thought of the thing again. I just thought of the thing. I just read fucking Flintstone. What the
[30028.87s -> 30039.56s]  hell? Thank you to the polar pair for the five dollars. Not 250. The last bit coming in here.
[30039.56s -> 30043.96s]  Hey Jerma. I've been watching your vid since eighth grade. Graduated high school in two
[30043.96s -> 30048.28s]  days. Pretty nervous anyway. Love your content. You always kept me laughing when I
[30048.36s -> 30053.48s]  was struggling with life. No amount of money can repay you for that. Sorry I couldn't give a bunch
[30053.48s -> 30062.36s]  saving for college and all. Oregon State. Oregon State. That's a long time to be watching me.
[30063.61s -> 30072.74s]  Eighth grade into graduating high school. Congratulations on that. Hope your week of
[30072.74s -> 30080.15s]  finals wasn't too stressful and your week of last week of school. I'm happy to be here. Happy
[30080.23s -> 30090.17s]  to hang out and enjoy these things together. You don't have to give me a thousand dollars.
[30090.17s -> 30096.31s]  You don't have to give me a dollar. If you do, thank you for that. You don't have to.
[30098.02s -> 30109.10s]  I love having a community like this. It's a lot of fun. We have a great time. Save for
[30109.10s -> 30120.70s]  college and good luck in the future. Thank you so much for your five dollars. You guys
[30120.70s -> 30126.94s]  are awesome. Is it stream legends time or how much time do we have left for stream legends?
[30130.25s -> 30136.95s]  Sorry I had to cut us off at the end there. There are things I need to prepare for. I wish
[30136.95s -> 30139.11s]  I could have finished that. It would have taken probably like another hour though.
[30146.23s -> 30155.51s]  2127. What year are we gonna end at? Seven minutes until I can do stream legends. Oh god.
[30158.47s -> 30174.58s]  Really? Let me see. I lost every game. I was really getting into that last one
[30174.58s -> 30182.39s]  there just because I started to come back and you just get lost in a game like that. You just
[30184.30s -> 30197.54s]  so much fun. Let's see stream legends. I don't understand what it is lately. My extensions
[30197.54s -> 30201.54s]  don't load anymore. My extension dashboard. I might have to like refresh these.
[30205.26s -> 30218.70s]  Yeah six and a half minutes. No stream legends. Six minutes. No. I promise with 100% certainty.
[30218.70s -> 30227.74s]  I promise. 100% certainty that I will come back in six minutes and I will press that button.
[30232.34s -> 30240.86s]  If I don't just tweet me over and over again until I do. Just send me. Just spam me with
[30240.86s -> 30250.41s]  tweets if I don't do it. You guys want some ads? All right. I did promise ads. I did. I
[30250.41s -> 30258.78s]  promised ads. Here you go. I'm gonna run. I'm gonna run an ad. Here comes a 30 second ad.
[30258.78s -> 30263.38s]  Thanks for supporting the stream. See you next time. Take care. Much love to you.
[30264.18s -> 30272.14s]  See you in a few days. Probably on Monday-ish. Check the sus. It'll be updated. Good night.
[30272.14s -> 30292.92s]  Take care. Much love to you. Commercial break failed. I cannot run it. Commercial break failed.
[30292.92s -> 30300.17s]  Commercial breaks are only allowed once every eight minutes. Did you guys get it? I didn't
[30300.17s -> 30316.23s]  get it. Why would I get it? Well that's it. Wish me luck. See you soon guys. Take care.
