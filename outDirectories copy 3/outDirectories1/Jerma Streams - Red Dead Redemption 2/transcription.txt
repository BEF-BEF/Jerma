[1.08s -> 15.43s]  Hey guys, what's up? How are you? We're here, currently, live, technically live.
[17.67s -> 25.98s]  I cannot guarantee that we're gonna be live for very long. We've had cocks at the house for the
[25.98s -> 35.56s]  last like six straight days, and they may have figured out one of the issues. So,
[36.60s -> 41.43s]  it's just like the first Red Dead stream, that's right. We'll see how long we can go.
[42.60s -> 48.86s]  This is going to be one of those mystery boxes that you open. The stream might be two hours.
[48.86s -> 54.63s]  It might be 10 minutes. It might be six hours. I don't know. I can't, it's a mystery.
[55.35s -> 59.43s]  Just literally RNG the stream. I know it already already got already dead.
[59.43s -> 66.52s]  No, no, we're okay. Are we? No? Hey, I'm here. We just almost dropped though.
[67.08s -> 77.00s]  Hey, that's probably gonna happen like every 15 minutes. One minute. Oh, shit.
[78.52s -> 83.96s]  All right, when I press the button, it's probably, it's probably gonna do that.
[86.36s -> 93.19s]  So, let's ride it out here for as long as we can. I'll do my, do my best to.
[94.39s -> 108.90s]  Oh, this is getting ugly. Before he moves back. No, there's no going back.
[115.18s -> 125.85s]  Damn, it was just green for so long too. It was just so solid green and now it just doesn't
[125.85s -> 128.73s]  want to, just doesn't want to do it. Let's just, what's with the music?
[129.93s -> 140.20s]  You might be hearing the PS4 sound effects. Let's see. It's, it's there.
[143.29s -> 149.93s]  Moved on from Comcast and got worse internet. I have no idea. It's almost like a bad joke
[150.01s -> 158.84s]  at this point because this is a, this is a gigabit line. This is a, this is a thousand
[159.48s -> 166.63s]  megabits per second down. This is what we get for down. And they're, they just have some major,
[166.63s -> 180.71s]  major issues that are apparently, take a lot of work to solve. So, this is happening way
[180.71s -> 190.12s]  more frequently than it just was. Nice, already buffering, getting a buffering popup already.
[194.07s -> 200.30s]  Yeah, well, we'll let, let just, just hang out with me for a minute. We'll sit here for a moment
[201.02s -> 209.18s]  because we do get these spots of like a few hours where it's perfectly fine.
[211.03s -> 215.53s]  I'm getting back in a balloon. I'm going back to Boston. Let's see. What do I take
[215.53s -> 224.57s]  this screen off? What if I did this? Like you can see that, right? Because that's, that's
[224.57s -> 231.96s]  red dead right there. Come on, just like, just like feed me through the line that I need
[231.96s -> 245.14s]  to be on. So I cannot guarantee the authenticity of this current stream. And I'm, I'm so afraid to
[245.14s -> 251.06s]  press the story button. I'm going to press X and it's going to crash the fucking node.
[251.94s -> 265.30s]  What a social club. I think it's the rock star thing when you get online, right? Press X.
[265.30s -> 269.96s]  Should I? I'm so scared. I'm so scared that it's not going to work.
[270.76s -> 281.59s]  I should, here goes the node. I'm doing it. I care. I will fight through the frame drops here
[283.45s -> 289.30s]  because you guys wouldn't even believe this is nothing. We would lose internet for
[289.30s -> 295.96s]  12 straight hours. It would just be zero. All right. I'm going. I'm here. We go.
[296.68s -> 317.74s]  Wish me luck. Ready? One, two. I did it. Okay. Okay. I'll turn it up a little bit.
[318.70s -> 326.36s]  So this is, so this is red dead redemption two, by the way, if you weren't aware,
[326.36s -> 333.56s]  it's a new Western game that came out. I mean, is this supposed to be somebody talking here?
[334.12s -> 344.55s]  Spoilers. Well, what are you doing at a red dead two stream? If you're scared about spoilers.
[352.65s -> 360.50s]  I lived in Vinnie's dryer for a week. Well, that's not out of the ordinary though.
[361.22s -> 376.97s]  I pay rent and the age of outlaws and gunslingers was at an end. I have to turn this
[377.05s -> 394.06s]  up. There's like a volume control on this dumb thing. There we go. Turn it up. It's
[394.06s -> 401.85s]  got to do a cowboy accent. I've even the wish had mostly been tamed. That was until they showed
[401.85s -> 414.18s]  up. Bill, Bob, Barry, Borg. A few gangs still remain, but they were being hunted down and
[414.18s -> 419.77s]  destroyed. I can't read cursive. I got taught cursive. I don't know how to fucking read it.
[421.38s -> 424.10s]  There we go. That was a cursive. I would have been upset about that.
[427.08s -> 449.02s]  Rockstar games presents red dead two. Why does it look like horror movie text? Here we go.
[449.02s -> 455.85s]  I'm so excited for this. Give me my internet. I deserve it. I deserve an internet.
[469.69s -> 473.93s]  That's a lot of bird shit. All right, stop. I want to make a joke about a million birds
[473.93s -> 479.43s]  shitting all over them, but I can't stop it. Don't stop soon. We'll all be dying.
[480.57s -> 485.29s]  Whether it's May, I'm just hoping the law got as lost as we did.
[486.41s -> 495.06s]  There, Arthur. Any luck? That's me, right? I found a place where we can get some shelter.
[495.94s -> 502.34s]  Let Davey rest while he, you know, an old man in town.
[505.14s -> 517.37s]  Come on. Come on. Old man in town. 10 FPS with gameplay. You might be referring to
[517.37s -> 536.12s]  my internet. Chapter one. Byron. I don't know what that says. I'm not going to read the
[536.12s -> 552.12s]  subtitles at the bottom. I'm going to try to read it. Flash Schlistro. This game is like
[552.12s -> 556.44s]  an hour long tutorial. Hey, just long enough to us to make sure the internet will stay on.
[556.44s -> 570.04s]  Hey, welcome to the stream. Oh my God. Ms. Gaskell, get that fire link.
[570.84s -> 577.16s]  Javadab just gave 250 dollars. Mr. Pearson, see what we've got in terms of food.
[580.36s -> 587.37s]  Davey's dead. Thank you, Javadab. Nothing more you could have done. What are we going to do?
[587.37s -> 592.25s]  We need supplies. Well, first of all, you're going to stay here and you were going to get
[592.25s -> 598.81s]  yourself worn. And I sent John and Mike scouting out ahead. That's welcome. Thank you, man.
[598.81s -> 602.65s]  Thank you so much. See if we can find one. We can wait for some time to deliver these bits
[602.65s -> 606.41s]  to you. It's great to see you back in action, especially after you had to once again deal
[606.41s -> 611.77s]  with some internet issues. Still are. Listen. Still are at the moment. Listen to me,
[611.85s -> 625.90s]  all for a moment. Now we've had John a bad couple of days. I loved Davey, Jenny,
[627.94s -> 635.66s]  Sean, Mac, John, barf bag. We don't know. Something like that. But we lost some folks.
[637.18s -> 648.15s]  Now, if I could throw myself in the ground in their stead, I'd do it. Gladly. Quit
[648.15s -> 655.48s]  Comcast. I don't have Comcast. I have a different ISP across the country and it still follows me.
[655.48s -> 664.30s]  Everybody. We're safe now. There ain't nobody following us through a storm like this one.
[665.26s -> 669.74s]  By the time they get here. Well, we're going to be, we're going to be long gone.
[671.59s -> 675.19s]  We've been through worse than this. John McFar's stun. That was the guy.
[675.19s -> 680.39s]  Mr. Pierce, Ms. Grimshaw. I need you to turn this place into a camp.
[681.19s -> 689.29s]  We may be here for a few days. Now, all of you, all of you get yourselves warm.
[691.06s -> 696.18s]  Stay strong. It might be the modem router. Oh, no, no, no. Single option is being.
[698.50s -> 700.98s]  So they both must have headed down the hill.
[701.94s -> 715.62s]  Sure. Hey. Oh, are we like dead dead now? I had time to ask. Oh, boy.
[716.26s -> 722.58s]  What really went down back there on that boat? We missed you. That's what happened. Come on.
[723.22s -> 730.87s]  Hey, you need horses. Oh, yeah. Hey, Mr. Smith, get yourself indoors.
[732.23s -> 735.43s]  I know. I can see it over here. Get indoors, son.
[737.35s -> 739.75s]  All right. I get to play the game though. Need you strong.
[741.35s -> 752.47s]  Okay. It's deep snow. I ain't sure what we're going to find out here, Dutz.
[752.47s -> 755.19s]  We have to try. Is this game not on PC at all? Is it on PC now?
[755.19s -> 759.67s]  We'll do our best to stick to the trail. This goddamn weather.
[759.67s -> 762.87s]  It's been two days or more like this now. Yeah, I didn't think it was.
[765.45s -> 771.34s]  There's Jabba Dab's two hundred and fifty dollars coming in. Again, thank you so much, man.
[771.34s -> 774.54s]  I know I'm like trying to bounce and monitor my connection and play a game.
[774.70s -> 780.62s]  And thank you so fucking much, dude. It's a huge amount of money.
[787.98s -> 791.34s]  Big delayed money. Yeah, I don't know why that's happening.
[797.83s -> 802.79s]  I don't know what it is with Rockstar and not putting their flagship video games on PC.
[803.75s -> 806.55s]  The first Red Dead is not even on. Red Dead Redemption is not on
[806.55s -> 814.55s]  PC at all or some strange reason we need to get those people warm and fed.
[815.27s -> 818.87s]  At least we don't need to worry about Pinkerton's tailing us in this
[819.67s -> 826.87s]  a couple more days. You need to help me pick the others back up.
[826.87s -> 830.47s]  Okay. You're the only one I can rely on to stay.
[830.47s -> 835.67s]  I'm sorry. All I heard was crouch in the corner and throw rocks at people.
[835.67s -> 839.43s]  Is that what you wanted me to do with my Dalmatian horse?
[840.95s -> 847.27s]  Oh, that's snow, right? I thought it was like a giant Dalmatian.
[847.99s -> 858.38s]  Is that someone coming towards us? Someone coming towards us. Are they friendly?
[859.18s -> 863.64s]  Oh, cutscene. Bring it on.
[864.36s -> 870.41s]  Who's there? Guy on the left is going to be picked off with an arrow.
[872.34s -> 875.69s]  Micah. Gentlemen.
[876.33s -> 881.78s]  The audio is delayed. I think so. Found a little homestead down that way.
[881.94s -> 885.03s]  Okay. Anyone home? Sure.
[885.67s -> 889.67s]  Place is blazing with light and noise. Sounded like a party.
[889.67s -> 891.27s]  Let's go see. Follow me.
[892.39s -> 896.55s]  How's Davey doing? I didn't make it, nor did little Jenny.
[896.55s -> 900.07s]  Six B's. Bob, Barry. Davey was a real fighter.
[900.63s -> 902.47s]  Both of them calendar boys is.
[902.47s -> 904.87s]  Bugle. Was. Yeah.
[905.83s -> 907.99s]  And Mac, Sean. We don't know.
[909.75s -> 910.87s]  A business.
[915.98s -> 920.66s]  All right, Micah. Ask him if he's seen John.
[922.28s -> 924.79s]  Have you seen John? John.
[924.79s -> 928.95s]  He's talking about our John. My John. First game, John.
[929.83s -> 943.21s]  Let me take the rear.
[943.21s -> 947.24s]  Double tap and hold while pushing.
[947.96s -> 950.12s]  How is it to hold? It just disappeared.
[955.67s -> 958.58s]  Talk to Mike. Are you sure about this?
[959.64s -> 960.20s]  Let's do that.
[962.20s -> 967.56s]  Mr. Morgan. I never thought I would be so pleased to see your face.
[967.56s -> 971.40s]  Things always turn out fine. Except for in Red Dead Redemption.
[971.40s -> 976.20s]  Where's everyone else? Old mining camp back up the hill.
[976.20s -> 979.96s]  Hung for daddy to put food on the table.
[979.96s -> 981.16s]  Gotta love these graphics, though.
[981.16s -> 985.16s]  You said it before. We got too many mouths to feed.
[986.12s -> 987.72s]  Snow actually permeates.
[987.72s -> 988.92s]  So you should be happy.
[989.56s -> 992.36s]  That ain't fair, Arthur. I earn my share.
[992.36s -> 994.20s]  I keep saying people tell me to keep looking at the balls.
[994.20s -> 997.88s]  Think it's unreasonable to expect others to do the same.
[997.88s -> 1000.20s]  I wouldn't do that in real life. Why would I do that in a video game?
[1002.20s -> 1007.72s]  If I was in this time period, I wouldn't go underneath the carriage like it was an oil change.
[1007.72s -> 1009.64s]  And lift up the tail and look at the ball sack.
[1009.64s -> 1010.44s]  What are you talking about?
[1010.44s -> 1012.28s]  You know me. I'm a good boy.
[1012.28s -> 1015.93s]  You look under your car and look for your car's balls?
[1017.05s -> 1019.93s]  What would be the car balls? I'm trying to think what it would be.
[1023.78s -> 1025.46s]  The car balls would be like the muffler, right?
[1025.46s -> 1030.18s]  Okay. Let's keep it down now, gentlemen. It's just up ahead.
[1030.74s -> 1032.42s]  I'm getting exhausted.
[1035.11s -> 1035.61s]  Turn it down.
[1036.47s -> 1043.06s]  Let's head down there.
[1043.62s -> 1053.38s]  I can't fall off this, can I?
[1054.18s -> 1057.85s]  Health is displayed in the lower left corner.
[1057.85s -> 1059.61s]  That tiny little thing is health?
[1063.05s -> 1065.53s]  That's so small. How am I supposed to see that?
[1066.41s -> 1067.69s]  Wait, is this like Super Mario?
[1067.69s -> 1069.85s]  Where there's like three quadrants?
[1072.41s -> 1073.29s]  Let's hitch up here.
[1073.93s -> 1077.06s]  The outer bar shows it.
[1078.84s -> 1081.08s]  All right. But that was like about an outer bar and an inner bar.
[1081.80s -> 1085.58s]  Approach the hitching post.
[1085.58s -> 1086.38s]  Let's get it on here.
[1086.70s -> 1090.34s]  Triangle hitches the horse.
[1091.22s -> 1094.84s]  Now we got our first set of action here, I think.
[1094.84s -> 1096.20s]  You don't want to scare these folks.
[1098.54s -> 1099.74s]  Follow Dutch.
[1099.74s -> 1100.46s]  I remember Dutch.
[1101.70s -> 1103.30s]  Sounds like quite the party.
[1105.16s -> 1106.28s]  This is a lot of snow.
[1107.00s -> 1110.74s]  You too. Get yourself out of sight.
[1110.74s -> 1115.94s]  One of them is a lot less intimidating than three nasty-looking degenerates.
[1115.94s -> 1117.30s]  My father?
[1117.30s -> 1118.90s]  In that cattle shed on the left.
[1118.90s -> 1121.34s]  Micah, get down behind that wagon.
[1121.34s -> 1130.78s]  Why does this have to follow me everywhere I go?
[1130.78s -> 1131.74s]  I don't understand.
[1131.82s -> 1133.42s]  I said get out of sight.
[1134.22s -> 1135.66s]  Go to the shed and press R1.
[1135.66s -> 1136.14s]  Take cover.
[1136.78s -> 1137.66s]  There's this shed over here.
[1138.94s -> 1142.73s]  Arthur, take cover in that shed over there.
[1142.73s -> 1143.85s]  Glad it took three weeks.
[1145.13s -> 1146.65s]  Blame Cox Communications.
[1148.82s -> 1151.22s]  Because these motherfuckers can't figure it out either.
[1152.02s -> 1153.30s]  And it's their service.
[1153.94s -> 1155.82s]  This is the shed, right?
[1159.98s -> 1160.62s]  There.
[1160.62s -> 1161.02s]  It's not.
[1161.02s -> 1162.14s]  We're in the cattle shed.
[1162.14s -> 1163.18s]  Oh, the cattle shed.
[1167.16s -> 1167.88s]  Like in this thing.
[1170.60s -> 1171.88s]  This is not the cattle shed.
[1176.18s -> 1176.74s]  Get up there.
[1177.14s -> 1178.34s]  Did I just take my glasses off?
[1181.24s -> 1182.12s]  How do I get out of here?
[1182.12s -> 1182.52s]  I'm sorry.
[1182.52s -> 1183.80s]  I haven't been paying attention.
[1183.80s -> 1185.00s]  Get in position.
[1188.63s -> 1190.15s]  What cattle shed is he's referring to?
[1190.15s -> 1190.63s]  In here?
[1191.27s -> 1198.84s]  This is not the shed?
[1200.44s -> 1209.02s]  Stuck because no blip.
[1209.02s -> 1213.26s]  No, stuck because I have to look over here and watch 5% of every frame drop.
[1213.98s -> 1217.82s]  Because it's taken this company three weeks to try to fix a problem.
[1218.78s -> 1219.90s]  Oh my fucking god.
[1219.90s -> 1220.78s]  It's infuriating.
[1221.34s -> 1230.20s]  Go back.
[1230.20s -> 1231.00s]  Go to the shed.
[1232.22s -> 1233.90s]  Is it the shed that's like straight in front of me here?
[1236.66s -> 1237.94s]  That looked like a cattle shed to me.
[1242.18s -> 1243.30s]  The huge yellow thing.
[1243.30s -> 1244.74s]  That's, isn't that where it just was?
[1245.54s -> 1249.03s]  Like isn't this, this is where I was.
[1249.03s -> 1249.91s]  Isn't this where I was?
[1251.59s -> 1252.55s]  Highlighted in yellow.
[1252.55s -> 1254.39s]  This thing here, isn't this where it just was?
[1255.83s -> 1256.55s]  I just did this.
[1258.14s -> 1259.02s]  Didn't I just do this?
[1266.28s -> 1267.56s]  I didn't hide.
[1282.81s -> 1283.45s]  A gentleman.
[1283.45s -> 1284.25s]  There goes Michael.
[1284.25s -> 1285.77s]  We can't help you, mister.
[1285.77s -> 1286.41s]  What's he going to do?
[1287.05s -> 1288.57s]  I got, folks.
[1288.57s -> 1290.94s]  Arthur, we got a problem.
[1290.94s -> 1299.43s]  Just me, so do you.
[1299.43s -> 1301.91s]  Protect Dutch.
[1301.91s -> 1302.47s]  Okay.
[1302.47s -> 1304.39s]  Is this guy going to fire at him?
[1304.39s -> 1306.60s]  I think you should go now.
[1307.24s -> 1314.46s]  Crap.
[1314.46s -> 1318.10s]  Bunch.
[1329.11s -> 1332.55s]  I just like, holy shit, this is aiming is a little weird.
[1334.07s -> 1337.77s]  What's with the aiming?
[1341.86s -> 1343.22s]  It's like, why is it pulling me?
[1343.94s -> 1352.39s]  I got to change the sensitivity here.
[1353.83s -> 1363.05s]  Great soundtrack, yeah?
[1364.01s -> 1367.51s]  All right.
[1367.51s -> 1367.83s]  Where is it?
[1367.83s -> 1368.15s]  This way?
[1369.27s -> 1374.86s]  He's not going to last by himself out there.
[1376.06s -> 1379.08s]  Now he won't last at all.
[1386.04s -> 1387.00s]  You didn't handle it.
[1387.00s -> 1388.04s]  I had to do something about it.
[1388.04s -> 1396.22s]  I'm not going to follow him.
[1406.34s -> 1407.70s]  Fucking internet companies, man.
[1410.57s -> 1412.89s]  Hold square near items to pick them up by searching the house.
[1414.89s -> 1415.21s]  Okay.
[1415.53s -> 1416.01s]  Medicine.
[1416.97s -> 1417.45s]  Whiskey.
[1418.09s -> 1422.58s]  They're going to open pots and shit?
[1422.58s -> 1426.47s]  It's just cabinets.
[1431.45s -> 1433.29s]  Hold near items to pick them up while searching.
[1433.29s -> 1434.49s]  A can of sweet corn.
[1434.49s -> 1435.37s]  Maybe they're hiding up here, too.
[1436.25s -> 1438.89s]  There's a big price on Cuomo Drisco's head.
[1438.89s -> 1440.01s]  Assorted biscuits.
[1440.01s -> 1443.35s]  Here's as big as a one on you.
[1443.35s -> 1443.67s]  Fruits.
[1443.67s -> 1445.19s]  You're probably the only thing me is.
[1445.19s -> 1446.31s]  Whiskey is not essential?
[1446.31s -> 1447.35s]  Wait, are you serious?
[1448.23s -> 1451.67s]  Your health core drains over time and is now empty.
[1451.67s -> 1452.87s]  Well, empty you will experience negative effects.
[1452.87s -> 1454.39s]  Do you need something now?
[1454.39s -> 1456.55s]  Get your strength up for the ride back.
[1456.55s -> 1457.77s]  Do you have to eat in this game?
[1461.18s -> 1462.65s]  Okay.
[1462.65s -> 1466.17s]  Slightly restores health core and moderately restores stamina core.
[1466.81s -> 1468.30s]  Interesting.
[1468.86s -> 1473.75s]  And then we have to go bake beans so that back in the middle is your core.
[1475.94s -> 1478.10s]  Slightly restores health core.
[1478.10s -> 1478.42s]  All right.
[1481.77s -> 1483.37s]  Let's just do this in the middle one first.
[1483.37s -> 1484.09s]  Let's just try it out.
[1487.37s -> 1488.17s]  Survival mode?
[1488.17s -> 1488.81s]  It seems like it.
[1488.81s -> 1493.96s]  Delicious, dry, warm, and inject down here.
[1493.96s -> 1495.16s]  Maybe we'll see how they are when we head back.
[1495.16s -> 1497.56s]  Better quality food will refill more core.
[1497.56s -> 1500.39s]  I don't really want us to split up.
[1500.39s -> 1503.19s]  Okay.
[1503.19s -> 1505.03s]  I got to refill my four cores.
[1505.67s -> 1513.88s]  Let's look around for some more stuff.
[1521.43s -> 1523.83s]  Just controls how fast you refill your health and stamina.
[1526.34s -> 1526.98s]  Better than nothing.
[1530.15s -> 1533.08s]  There's a lot of random shit on the mantle.
[1534.17s -> 1535.21s]  Examine the photograph.
[1535.21s -> 1535.45s]  Sure.
[1536.09s -> 1536.97s]  Let's get some lore.
[1537.61s -> 1539.21s]  Poor bastard was married to.
[1539.85s -> 1541.90s]  Okay.
[1541.90s -> 1543.18s]  Flip it around.
[1543.18s -> 1544.06s]  Secret code in the back.
[1545.02s -> 1548.36s]  Quake and Idy wedding.
[1551.99s -> 1553.43s]  Jett's tonbri.
[1555.19s -> 1555.83s]  I can't read it.
[1560.18s -> 1561.46s]  Oh, there we go.
[1561.46s -> 1561.86s]  Okay.
[1566.84s -> 1569.05s]  I'm just kidding.
[1569.77s -> 1571.54s]  Oh, look.
[1571.54s -> 1572.66s]  It's from the first game.
[1572.66s -> 1574.10s]  That's the cottage from the first game.
[1574.66s -> 1574.82s]  All right.
[1574.82s -> 1583.26s]  What's we got?
[1583.26s -> 1584.46s]  Two dollars and 43 cents.
[1585.02s -> 1588.34s]  Have we dropped a frame in the last, like, 15 minutes?
[1588.34s -> 1588.98s]  Can anybody tell?
[1589.70s -> 1591.32s]  Or do I have to, like,
[1591.32s -> 1593.32s]  or do I have to, like, scream as loud as I can?
[1599.99s -> 1600.71s]  I have?
[1600.71s -> 1601.35s]  God damn it.
[1601.35s -> 1603.03s]  Well, I say it now and now I just did right here.
[1603.67s -> 1610.70s]  I think that's all I can get.
[1613.29s -> 1615.29s]  Arthur, keep looking for stuff.
[1615.93s -> 1619.38s]  Arthur, go see if there's anything in that barn.
[1619.94s -> 1620.34s]  Okay.
[1620.34s -> 1622.26s]  Micah, you search the cabin.
[1622.26s -> 1623.14s]  See what we missed.
[1623.94s -> 1624.34s]  Sure.
[1625.93s -> 1626.57s]  All right, let's go.
[1627.80s -> 1628.76s]  Investigate the barn.
[1628.76s -> 1630.84s]  I'm going to go take a look and I'm going to go examine it.
[1633.72s -> 1635.32s]  No drop frames since the fight.
[1635.32s -> 1636.60s]  Now you can look at the current objective.
[1637.42s -> 1638.30s]  What's that?
[1638.30s -> 1640.38s]  Is that a bad guy, good guy thing there?
[1641.34s -> 1648.17s]  The atmosphere is great.
[1648.17s -> 1648.65s]  Yeah.
[1648.65s -> 1649.61s]  So far it looks awesome.
[1650.25s -> 1655.72s]  That guy just top roped you.
[1662.02s -> 1665.24s]  Ha, ha, ha.
[1665.24s -> 1666.28s]  Hey, what's happening in here?
[1672.07s -> 1673.27s]  That guy didn't get one hit in.
[1673.99s -> 1674.63s]  Should you kill him?
[1678.06s -> 1679.19s]  Interrogate.
[1681.34s -> 1682.14s]  All right, beat him.
[1685.35s -> 1686.79s]  This is just like the Punisher game.
[1689.66s -> 1690.14s]  Where is he?
[1691.02s -> 1691.42s]  Where is he?
[1699.93s -> 1700.25s]  Okay.
[1701.53s -> 1702.09s]  Anything else?
[1704.25s -> 1714.68s]  Thanks for the info, buddy.
[1719.16s -> 1719.72s]  Anything else?
[1720.84s -> 1723.40s]  What was the last time you shit your pants?
[1725.48s -> 1725.72s]  Joe!
[1726.60s -> 1728.38s]  When did it happen?
[1729.96s -> 1730.20s]  When?
[1731.32s -> 1732.68s]  When was the last time you shit your pants?
[1737.93s -> 1746.04s]  Let's try to grab him again.
[1748.74s -> 1750.02s]  He's like, come here, I'm not done with you.
[1750.82s -> 1756.04s]  Oh, there are animals over here?
[1756.92s -> 1757.72s]  What the fuck?
[1759.30s -> 1759.94s]  What's happening?
[1766.54s -> 1768.14s]  I have to restart the whole thing?
[1769.32s -> 1770.20s]  Oh, shit.
[1773.05s -> 1773.69s]  Wasted.
[1774.49s -> 1776.41s]  By walking out of the frame.
[1780.28s -> 1781.24s]  Oh, god damn it.
[1783.50s -> 1784.14s]  Well, all right.
[1787.26s -> 1789.85s]  Tell us, tell us again.
[1792.17s -> 1793.29s]  First passing hug.
[1793.29s -> 1794.09s]  I can't keep up.
[1801.14s -> 1802.26s]  His clothes changed?
[1806.04s -> 1807.56s]  Fiction to rob some train.
[1808.28s -> 1809.48s]  Gonna blow the tracks.
[1810.20s -> 1811.94s]  I don't know the net, I swear.
[1811.94s -> 1815.46s]  There were, that's his worst mission boundaries than in GTA V.
[1815.46s -> 1818.42s]  Well, I would say it looks like you have this, Arthur.
[1818.42s -> 1819.46s]  Do what you want with him.
[1819.46s -> 1820.90s]  All right, so now we get a second chance.
[1820.90s -> 1821.62s]  Should I spare him?
[1821.62s -> 1823.54s]  This guy, remember saving Private Ryan.
[1824.66s -> 1825.94s]  This motherfucker's gonna come back.
[1827.69s -> 1828.89s]  I don't want to do that.
[1828.89s -> 1829.77s]  But what if he comes back?
[1830.97s -> 1840.39s]  Where's my gun?
[1840.39s -> 1847.77s]  Focus on the horse.
[1849.13s -> 1852.41s]  Where are you?
[1855.21s -> 1855.77s]  In the barn?
[1856.49s -> 1857.51s]  How'd you get in here?
[1858.23s -> 1860.58s]  How did you get in here?
[1860.58s -> 1862.58s]  Well, I can, oh, I can calm the horse.
[1862.58s -> 1863.54s]  This is not my horse.
[1864.42s -> 1869.82s]  What, is this gonna freak out and start hitting me?
[1874.63s -> 1880.50s]  This looks animatronic.
[1880.50s -> 1881.38s]  I don't know if I trust it.
[1881.38s -> 1882.10s]  It's animatronic.
[1886.84s -> 1888.04s]  Don't ever stand behind a horse.
[1888.04s -> 1888.84s]  That's what I was told.
[1898.31s -> 1899.35s]  Check his balls, no.
[1899.99s -> 1901.72s]  All right, let's lead the horse.
[1902.36s -> 1903.85s]  Continuing to bond with your horse
[1903.85s -> 1905.85s]  increases its trust in you and improves its attributes.
[1906.73s -> 1915.80s]  The horse has now become your horse
[1915.80s -> 1918.60s]  as indicated by a blip on the radar.
[1918.68s -> 1918.84s]  Okay.
[1923.42s -> 1924.70s]  We still fucking drop, yeah.
[1930.44s -> 1931.08s]  God damn it.
[1933.72s -> 1938.12s]  This is like, I'm like really containing myself right now.
[1938.12s -> 1940.76s]  I'm like, I have like a, I'm holding back.
[1941.48s -> 1945.94s]  But this has been like an infuriating process.
[1953.98s -> 1956.86s]  Literally moved across the country
[1957.66s -> 1960.06s]  to a different fucking state.
[1963.34s -> 1968.07s]  Got a faster line and it's worse than it was before.
[1968.63s -> 1971.16s]  That's unbelievable.
[1971.80s -> 1973.64s]  With a different company.
[1981.78s -> 1983.22s]  A gigabit connection.
[1984.18s -> 1992.76s]  Thousand fucking megabits a second.
[1992.76s -> 1993.96s]  Eventually it's gonna get fixed,
[1993.96s -> 1995.16s]  but who fucking knows when.
[2000.98s -> 2002.34s]  Maybe you're the problem.
[2004.26s -> 2006.06s]  I don't think so.
[2006.06s -> 2007.82s]  I haven't had enough time to be the problem.
[2009.08s -> 2011.16s]  Turned on the modem, got an IP.
[2011.16s -> 2011.66s]  That's it.
[2012.44s -> 2025.03s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[2026.31s -> 2026.81s]  Get off me.
[2028.15s -> 2028.55s]  Okay.
[2028.55s -> 2028.95s]  Hold on.
[2028.95s -> 2029.59s]  Come in here, boy.
[2029.59s -> 2029.99s]  Let's go.
[2048.42s -> 2050.02s]  Just keep going west until you get there.
[2057.37s -> 2058.49s]  It is going to be okay.
[2059.29s -> 2061.85s]  We mean you no harm.
[2061.85s -> 2065.00s]  Miss, come on.
[2065.00s -> 2066.22s]  It'll be okay.
[2067.48s -> 2069.32s]  We need to get out of here and quick.
[2070.04s -> 2070.52s]  Come on.
[2070.52s -> 2071.02s]  Fire.
[2074.36s -> 2076.94s]  You okay, miss?
[2078.62s -> 2079.50s]  Three days ago.
[2081.90s -> 2084.14s]  My internet's acting up because I clicked on your screen.
[2085.18s -> 2087.26s]  Miss, you are safe now.
[2088.30s -> 2090.06s]  And you can't stay here.
[2090.06s -> 2091.10s]  I mean that fire wasn't bad.
[2091.10s -> 2093.10s]  You could just jump on that thing and roll around
[2093.10s -> 2093.90s]  and it would have gone off.
[2093.90s -> 2094.62s]  You come with us.
[2095.18s -> 2095.68s]  Of course.
[2096.78s -> 2099.02s]  Miss, it's okay.
[2100.22s -> 2101.02s]  We're bad men.
[2102.34s -> 2102.98s]  We ain't them.
[2105.22s -> 2105.86s]  It's okay.
[2107.98s -> 2108.48s]  Get on.
[2109.34s -> 2112.22s]  We'll keep you safe until you figure out what you want to do.
[2113.26s -> 2114.79s]  What's your name, miss?
[2116.55s -> 2117.05s]  Miss.
[2118.15s -> 2118.65s]  Adler.
[2119.35s -> 2119.85s]  Adler.
[2120.78s -> 2123.10s]  What is it that Dory's been burning easy during a blizzard?
[2123.10s -> 2123.60s]  Mrs.
[2124.48s -> 2124.98s]  I...
[2126.68s -> 2127.18s]  He...
[2127.64s -> 2130.22s]  He was my husband.
[2151.34s -> 2153.39s]  Hey, somebody's coming.
[2154.83s -> 2156.17s]  Looks like it's Dutch.
[2157.05s -> 2158.57s]  Hey, everybody, Dutch is back.
[2158.57s -> 2159.37s]  We good.
[2159.37s -> 2160.33s]  How'd you get on?
[2161.69s -> 2165.21s]  Micah found a homestead, but he weren't the first.
[2166.09s -> 2168.89s]  Colm or Driscoll and his scum, they beat us to it.
[2170.57s -> 2173.05s]  We found some of them there,
[2173.29s -> 2178.68s]  but there is more about, apparently, scouting the train.
[2179.48s -> 2179.98s]  Thank you.
[2180.60s -> 2182.68s]  And that's the last thing we need right now, Dutch.
[2182.68s -> 2184.28s]  Well, it is what it is.
[2184.28s -> 2188.76s]  But we found some supplies, some blankets, a little bit of food.
[2188.76s -> 2191.40s]  And this poor soul, Mrs. Adler,
[2192.12s -> 2194.60s]  Miss Tilly, Miss Karen, would you warm her up?
[2194.60s -> 2195.80s]  Give her a drink or something.
[2197.08s -> 2200.28s]  And Mrs. Adler, it's gonna be okay.
[2200.28s -> 2201.32s]  You're safe now.
[2202.28s -> 2204.20s]  They turned her into a widow.
[2204.20s -> 2206.36s]  He might never be on PC, but the last one wasn't either.
[2206.36s -> 2208.04s]  That's like the unfortunate thing.
[2208.04s -> 2209.64s]  I need some rest. I haven't slept in three days.
[2210.68s -> 2211.96s]  You're over here.
[2211.96s -> 2213.96s]  Miss O'Shea will show you the way.
[2213.96s -> 2216.36s]  Mr. Morgan, we put you in a room over here.
[2217.24s -> 2218.76s]  Thank you, Miss Grimshaw.
[2218.76s -> 2220.68s]  Mr. Bell, you're with the fellas over there.
[2221.64s -> 2223.72s]  Well, how come Arthur gets a room
[2223.72s -> 2226.28s]  and I get a bunk bed next to Bill Williamson
[2226.28s -> 2227.88s]  and a bunch of darkies?
[2227.88s -> 2229.08s]  Get yourself to bed.
[2229.88s -> 2239.74s]  The rocks are a bunch of idiots for not putting it on PC.
[2240.62s -> 2242.32s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[2242.32s -> 2244.16s]  There's gotta be some reason why.
[2244.16s -> 2246.56s]  I think there's not, but I really wonder.
[2247.76s -> 2253.16s]  He ain't been seen in days where there ain't let up.
[2254.22s -> 2256.70s]  He's strong and he's smart.
[2256.70s -> 2257.50s]  Strong, at least.
[2258.54s -> 2259.26s]  Hello, Arthur.
[2260.22s -> 2260.78s]  Abigail.
[2261.82s -> 2263.74s]  Arthur, how you doing?
[2265.18s -> 2266.54s]  Just fine, Abigail.
[2267.42s -> 2267.74s]  And you?
[2269.87s -> 2270.51s]  I need you to...
[2271.31s -> 2273.07s]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry to ask, but...
[2273.07s -> 2274.51s]  It's little John.
[2274.51s -> 2277.07s]  He's got himself caught into a scrape again.
[2277.07s -> 2278.67s]  He ain't been seen in two...
[2280.19s -> 2280.51s]  Hours.
[2280.51s -> 2281.23s]  Two days.
[2281.23s -> 2282.91s]  Your John will be fine.
[2283.63s -> 2286.43s]  I mean, he may be as dumb as rocks
[2286.43s -> 2288.19s]  and as dull as rusted iron,
[2288.19s -> 2290.19s]  but that ain't changing because
[2290.19s -> 2292.03s]  he got caught in some snowstorm.
[2292.03s -> 2293.07s]  Please go take a look.
[2293.71s -> 2294.35s]  Javier?
[2294.35s -> 2295.23s]  Yes.
[2295.23s -> 2298.11s]  Javier, will you ride out with Arthur
[2298.11s -> 2299.31s]  to take a look for John?
[2300.11s -> 2302.03s]  You're the two best fit men we've got.
[2302.59s -> 2302.91s]  Now?
[2303.95s -> 2304.27s]  She's...
[2304.99s -> 2305.47s]  We're all...
[2306.67s -> 2308.91s]  Yeah, we're pretty worried about him.
[2308.91s -> 2312.51s]  I know the situation were reversed
[2312.51s -> 2315.32s]  and he looked for me.
[2318.76s -> 2319.32s]  Thank you.
[2320.68s -> 2322.01s]  Is he in a British accent?
[2323.26s -> 2323.82s]  This way.
[2324.94s -> 2327.82s]  Last I know, John was headed up the river.
[2328.54s -> 2331.68s]  We know he kept riding north.
[2334.92s -> 2335.72s]  Not like that.
[2335.72s -> 2339.08s]  That emote is making my chat scroll horizontally.
[2340.28s -> 2341.16s]  Wait, what?
[2341.80s -> 2342.28s]  Wait, what?
[2342.28s -> 2342.92s]  Wait, hold on.
[2345.39s -> 2346.51s]  What are you talking about?
[2351.23s -> 2352.75s]  It's time to find John Mar...
[2352.75s -> 2354.03s]  All right, I need to like get happy.
[2354.03s -> 2355.23s]  I'm like sad right now
[2355.23s -> 2356.75s]  because of this internet bullshit.
[2357.55s -> 2358.99s]  I gotta get like excited.
[2358.99s -> 2360.43s]  This is Red Dead Redemption 2.
[2360.43s -> 2361.07s]  This is not like...
[2362.19s -> 2363.39s]  This is not an iPad game.
[2364.19s -> 2368.14s]  Hey, I see some smoke.
[2368.14s -> 2369.34s]  Come on, let's take a look.
[2369.34s -> 2372.54s]  Let's hope it ain't more of O'Driscoll's boys.
[2372.54s -> 2378.78s]  Seems somebody left.
[2381.42s -> 2382.94s]  All right, let's do some investigating.
[2382.94s -> 2383.58s]  Reporting here.
[2385.55s -> 2386.03s]  Did he do it?
[2386.03s -> 2386.51s]  Did he do it?
[2386.51s -> 2386.91s]  Did he do it?
[2386.91s -> 2387.23s]  Did he do it?
[2387.23s -> 2387.71s]  Did he do it?
[2387.71s -> 2389.87s]  Are we not going to like it anyways?
[2389.87s -> 2390.11s]  What?
[2390.11s -> 2390.35s]  What?
[2391.87s -> 2393.23s]  I loved the first one.
[2394.99s -> 2396.19s]  The first one was great.
[2396.19s -> 2397.23s]  Let's inspect the camp.
[2400.40s -> 2401.12s]  There could be dust.
[2401.12s -> 2402.24s]  There could be fingerprints.
[2402.24s -> 2403.36s]  There's finger dust on here.
[2404.00s -> 2407.55s]  That's fine.
[2408.19s -> 2409.47s]  All right, fine, fine, fine.
[2410.11s -> 2414.22s]  I wanted to fucking dust for fingerprints
[2414.22s -> 2415.02s]  and you didn't want to do shit.
[2417.02s -> 2418.67s]  Watch out.
[2418.67s -> 2419.07s]  Watch out.
[2419.07s -> 2420.19s]  Hot, hot, hot, hot.
[2420.19s -> 2421.31s]  Burning, burning, burn.
[2423.31s -> 2424.27s]  Burn my horse's legs.
[2429.56s -> 2436.59s]  Stamina drains when your horse gallops or jumps.
[2436.59s -> 2437.79s]  I can't see anything.
[2437.79s -> 2438.59s]  We had the money.
[2438.59s -> 2439.39s]  It seemed fine.
[2440.19s -> 2441.79s]  Somebody turn the antennas around.
[2441.79s -> 2443.55s]  Bounty hunters?
[2443.55s -> 2444.99s]  No, Pinkerton's.
[2444.99s -> 2446.28s]  It was crazy.
[2446.84s -> 2447.64s]  Raining bullets.
[2448.83s -> 2450.27s]  That lake was steaming.
[2450.99s -> 2454.52s]  Well, this is a beautiful mountain though.
[2454.84s -> 2456.20s]  Watch out for this crevice.
[2457.24s -> 2459.84s]  To change camera distance and perspective, press.
[2460.96s -> 2469.31s]  It wouldn't even let me do the YouTuber joke.
[2469.31s -> 2469.71s]  Come on.
[2469.71s -> 2470.11s]  Why?
[2470.11s -> 2470.51s]  Come on.
[2472.54s -> 2473.34s]  Oh, sorry.
[2473.34s -> 2474.38s]  I got off track.
[2479.92s -> 2480.56s]  Let me just look.
[2481.20s -> 2481.60s]  Whoa.
[2481.60s -> 2491.16s]  Oh, you can't.
[2491.16s -> 2492.28s]  Hold on.
[2492.28s -> 2494.28s]  Wait, you can't.
[2494.28s -> 2494.78s]  Oh.
[2498.68s -> 2502.27s]  The horse wouldn't do it.
[2502.35s -> 2505.44s]  But you get off and you can do it.
[2505.44s -> 2507.12s]  Horse is smarter.
[2507.12s -> 2508.72s]  See, they continue up that way.
[2508.72s -> 2511.04s]  That fall was so stupid, too.
[2511.84s -> 2514.64s]  It was like he lost control of all of his body and function.
[2514.64s -> 2515.76s]  You tell me.
[2515.76s -> 2518.08s]  And that like, ah!
[2518.08s -> 2519.92s]  It was like Emperor Palpatine.
[2519.92s -> 2520.72s]  Let's just see where they lead.
[2520.72s -> 2523.52s]  Thrown into the thing in the end of the fourth movie.
[2524.24s -> 2526.32s]  He just did the Emperor Palpatine scream.
[2526.32s -> 2527.68s]  What really happened?
[2527.68s -> 2529.74s]  We had the money.
[2529.74s -> 2530.62s]  It seemed fine.
[2531.66s -> 2533.42s]  Then suddenly they were everywhere.
[2533.42s -> 2534.41s]  Hunters?
[2534.73s -> 2535.61s]  No, Pinkerton.
[2536.17s -> 2537.47s]  It was crazy.
[2542.22s -> 2543.82s]  All right, so I got the stamina bar.
[2544.70s -> 2546.14s]  The horse bar has the horseshoe.
[2546.86s -> 2550.51s]  Okay, so that's distance.
[2550.51s -> 2551.55s]  That's what I want.
[2551.55s -> 2552.43s]  Killed a girl in a boat.
[2552.43s -> 2553.23s]  FPS boat.
[2553.95s -> 2554.51s]  Bad way.
[2555.66s -> 2557.42s]  But it was a bad situation.
[2557.42s -> 2558.86s]  That ain't like him, though.
[2559.66s -> 2560.86s]  Okay, not gonna do it.
[2563.18s -> 2579.85s]  There's some tracks leading to the river.
[2579.85s -> 2581.45s]  It's not funny.
[2581.53s -> 2582.57s]  I'm sorry.
[2586.30s -> 2587.58s]  It's not funny.
[2587.58s -> 2588.78s]  Wait, that was a bear?
[2588.78s -> 2589.42s]  What are you talking about?
[2589.42s -> 2589.90s]  A bear?
[2592.54s -> 2594.30s]  That was, I was trying to turn around
[2594.30s -> 2595.34s]  because I was making the fake.
[2596.54s -> 2597.58s]  It's not funny.
[2598.22s -> 2598.78s]  It is funny.
[2599.42s -> 2600.46s]  It is funny.
[2600.46s -> 2600.86s]  Whatever.
[2600.86s -> 2603.18s]  You were there, Javi.
[2603.18s -> 2603.90s]  It was a bear?
[2603.90s -> 2604.86s]  I don't think it was a bear.
[2605.66s -> 2606.46s]  We had the money.
[2606.46s -> 2607.26s]  It seemed fine.
[2608.30s -> 2609.10s]  Was it a bear?
[2609.10s -> 2609.90s]  Then suddenly they were everywhere.
[2609.90s -> 2610.14s]  Then suddenly they were everywhere.
[2610.14s -> 2611.80s]  Turning hunters?
[2611.80s -> 2612.68s]  No, Pinkerton.
[2612.68s -> 2614.49s]  It was crazy.
[2614.65s -> 2617.88s]  Oh, it's not funny.
[2617.88s -> 2618.60s]  Please stop.
[2618.60s -> 2619.24s]  I'm sorry.
[2620.28s -> 2622.57s]  Take it slow.
[2622.57s -> 2623.69s]  Big ravine here.
[2623.69s -> 2624.97s]  Get me, I'm not going over there.
[2627.42s -> 2629.26s]  Dutch killed a girl.
[2629.26s -> 2629.98s]  My side.
[2630.54s -> 2631.10s]  Bad way.
[2632.22s -> 2633.58s]  But it was a bad situation.
[2634.14s -> 2635.98s]  That ain't like him, though.
[2635.98s -> 2642.25s]  Tracks go left, down here.
[2647.24s -> 2648.20s]  Javi got shot.
[2648.20s -> 2649.96s]  I'm not doing it one more time.
[2649.96s -> 2650.84s]  Both shot too.
[2651.64s -> 2652.92s]  Sean, we don't even know.
[2652.92s -> 2655.13s]  I'm surprised we escaped at all.
[2655.69s -> 2657.93s]  By the time you boys showed up from the other side of town,
[2658.73s -> 2663.90s]  I'm only just holding my business all right.
[2664.70s -> 2667.36s]  Activate cinematic camera.
[2667.36s -> 2668.24s]  Hold this button down.
[2668.24s -> 2670.24s]  Damn, snow's coming in hard again.
[2670.24s -> 2670.88s]  That's cool.
[2670.88s -> 2672.80s]  We'll lose these tracks if we don't move fast.
[2672.80s -> 2674.08s]  Automatically follow roads.
[2675.28s -> 2676.08s]  Oh, let's see.
[2676.08s -> 2677.76s]  It's like watching an actual movie.
[2678.88s -> 2679.28s]  Nice.
[2681.98s -> 2683.50s]  Change cinematic camera, press R3.
[2685.96s -> 2689.24s]  All right, there's a lot of use cases for this, I think.
[2690.04s -> 2695.21s]  But am I still controlling the character?
[2703.23s -> 2704.03s]  Oh, shit.
[2704.03s -> 2704.83s]  Yeah, I am.
[2707.92s -> 2708.88s]  That's hard to do.
[2709.68s -> 2715.12s]  All right, I'm going to play the whole game like this.
[2715.76s -> 2717.36s]  I'm going to be the first streamer on Twitch.
[2718.08s -> 2721.20s]  The first guy on Twitch to do it only in cinematic mode.
[2729.26s -> 2736.08s]  Looks like you know when you were 14 and you made that machinima.
[2737.36s -> 2739.69s]  That's what I'm doing right now.
[2742.08s -> 2749.45s]  I'm not going to turn it off.
[2750.25s -> 2751.82s]  Why would I turn this off?
[2762.20s -> 2762.76s]  Oh, wow.
[2762.76s -> 2763.56s]  Let's investigate.
[2763.56s -> 2764.44s]  Let's see if he can hear us.
[2764.44s -> 2765.56s]  He was riding this horse.
[2769.61s -> 2773.40s]  Help.
[2773.40s -> 2773.72s]  Where?
[2775.45s -> 2775.93s]  Up here.
[2776.57s -> 2779.69s]  I heard it from this way.
[2780.33s -> 2788.32s]  Is this the right way?
[2788.32s -> 2789.36s]  Am I going the fuck?
[2800.44s -> 2802.67s]  I gotta get it out of my system now.
[2802.67s -> 2803.79s]  Oh, shit.
[2803.79s -> 2804.27s]  Okay, don't.
[2807.15s -> 2809.39s]  Okay, no, no, no, no.
[2809.39s -> 2810.11s]  Just relax.
[2813.07s -> 2814.35s]  I'm not going to fucking do it again.
[2814.35s -> 2814.99s]  I'm sorry.
[2815.79s -> 2817.50s]  Do you think it's John?
[2817.98s -> 2820.86s]  You tell me tracks for sure.
[2820.86s -> 2822.64s]  But it could be anyone.
[2822.64s -> 2830.92s]  I have like the cinematic mode.
[2830.92s -> 2831.24s]  I'm trying.
[2831.24s -> 2832.12s]  I can't do it yet.
[2832.12s -> 2833.00s]  That's give me the money.
[2833.00s -> 2833.88s]  It seemed fine.
[2834.92s -> 2836.36s]  And suddenly there were everywhere.
[2837.56s -> 2840.04s]  It's five minutes to get fun though.
[2840.04s -> 2840.84s]  It was crazy.
[2841.72s -> 2843.80s]  I'm actually going to try to play the whole game in cinematic mode.
[2844.76s -> 2845.96s]  That'll be my schnick, right?
[2845.96s -> 2846.84s]  Like what the fuck?
[2846.84s -> 2852.52s]  Live stream replace entire Red Dead 2 in cinematic camera.
[2858.11s -> 2858.75s]  Okay, here we go.
[2864.65s -> 2865.13s]  No, I'm not.
[2865.13s -> 2865.69s]  I'm not going to jump.
[2865.69s -> 2867.45s]  I'm not falling off another edge.
[2867.45s -> 2869.21s]  That is a 100% guarantee.
[2875.21s -> 2877.85s]  Like I can 100% guarantee.
[2878.57s -> 2880.65s]  If I fall off the edge in the next like minute or two
[2880.65s -> 2882.09s]  in this like little tutorial,
[2882.09s -> 2884.17s]  I will do 100 pushups in a row.
[2884.17s -> 2884.65s]  On camera.
[2900.92s -> 2904.60s]  Take the germ attacks 30%.
[2905.72s -> 2913.12s]  It adds the bars to that support.
[2913.92s -> 2917.84s]  I'm not going to fall.
[2917.84s -> 2919.44s]  I'm doing the thing that's impossible.
[2919.44s -> 2921.20s]  You cannot fall like this.
[2921.20s -> 2926.41s]  It's not possible.
[2929.36s -> 2930.16s]  I'm holding X.
[2939.88s -> 2941.08s]  I'm tensed up right now.
[2941.08s -> 2942.04s]  Like you wouldn't believe.
[2949.40s -> 2950.80s]  I like this one.
[2953.52s -> 2956.48s]  How am I going to aim and shoot at people with cinematic camera?
[2957.28s -> 2957.92s]  Is that possible?
[2965.98s -> 2967.26s]  So close to the edge, yeah.
[2972.38s -> 2973.26s]  She has to guess.
[2974.38s -> 2975.34s]  I can't just guess.
[2977.53s -> 2978.65s]  This is beautiful though.
[2980.41s -> 2984.12s]  Let's get a different angle here.
[2984.12s -> 2985.16s]  Let's see if he can hear us.
[2985.96s -> 2987.85s]  So John is here somewhere.
[2995.13s -> 2996.32s]  All right, I'm going to follow him.
[2997.28s -> 2998.16s]  Up there.
[2998.16s -> 2998.96s]  Don't say up there.
[2999.76s -> 3000.96s]  Like I'm going to follow you.
[3001.76s -> 3002.64s]  Don't push me off.
[3003.52s -> 3008.75s]  All right.
[3009.31s -> 3009.79s]  Here we go.
[3010.35s -> 3013.52s]  Is it do I go over this?
[3015.04s -> 3016.73s]  All right, we're good.
[3017.53s -> 3019.05s]  We have to walk from here.
[3020.65s -> 3021.29s]  Oh no.
[3023.93s -> 3024.33s]  Oh no.
[3025.93s -> 3027.45s]  Grab shotgun.
[3028.17s -> 3031.88s]  Force weapons.
[3033.00s -> 3038.59s]  Okay, so our R1.
[3038.59s -> 3039.95s]  Okay, we can only have one sidearm.
[3039.95s -> 3040.83s]  So I'm going to get the shotgun.
[3042.11s -> 3047.71s]  So did I lose cinematic?
[3048.51s -> 3049.08s]  There we go.
[3049.08s -> 3049.56s]  It's back.
[3049.56s -> 3050.04s]  Wait, hold on.
[3051.00s -> 3051.24s]  Okay.
[3056.56s -> 3058.88s]  Oh, it turns off right when you hold the button down.
[3061.74s -> 3062.62s]  You can't do it.
[3062.62s -> 3063.90s]  But wait, is this an edge?
[3064.70s -> 3068.19s]  Okay, we're good.
[3076.22s -> 3076.62s]  It's on.
[3076.62s -> 3076.94s]  It's on.
[3085.96s -> 3086.84s]  I'm not cheating.
[3087.88s -> 3089.64s]  I want to see from another angle.
[3089.64s -> 3090.84s]  I don't want to see.
[3090.84s -> 3091.40s]  Holy fuck.
[3091.40s -> 3092.60s]  I just that doesn't count.
[3092.60s -> 3094.20s]  I fell off a ledge onto another ledge.
[3094.20s -> 3094.68s]  I didn't die.
[3095.72s -> 3103.95s]  Stamina displayed in the lower left corner.
[3103.95s -> 3104.99s]  I don't have a cinematic.
[3106.75s -> 3107.31s]  Okay.
[3107.31s -> 3108.51s]  This doesn't count either because this is...
[3109.47s -> 3110.78s]  Okay.
[3112.22s -> 3117.64s]  Oh god damn it.
[3125.21s -> 3126.57s]  Yeah, I'm all right.
[3132.76s -> 3135.77s]  This is the most stressful thing I've done in a long time.
[3137.69s -> 3140.25s]  Am I running the lip?
[3144.65s -> 3146.33s]  My stamina core is empty.
[3146.97s -> 3156.35s]  Square in this climb.
[3157.39s -> 3158.52s]  Get access to the shaft.
[3158.68s -> 3159.72s]  I need to eat something, man.
[3160.68s -> 3163.10s]  So I need some stamina here.
[3165.08s -> 3166.12s]  Classic oat cakes.
[3171.18s -> 3172.14s]  Is there just a stamina one?
[3172.78s -> 3176.40s]  Just canned peaches is fine.
[3189.47s -> 3190.67s]  I thought I just fucked it up.
[3194.89s -> 3196.57s]  That looks odd from cinematic view.
[3201.13s -> 3201.93s]  All right, we're doing fine.
[3203.60s -> 3210.17s]  Just eating peaches.
[3210.17s -> 3211.61s]  Canned peaches are where it's at, man.
[3212.25s -> 3213.37s]  That's good shit.
[3221.85s -> 3222.25s]  John?
[3225.74s -> 3226.14s]  John?
[3227.02s -> 3228.06s]  John, we'll be looking for you.
[3230.22s -> 3231.90s]  John, the streetlights are on.
[3231.90s -> 3233.34s]  You're in deep shit when you get home.
[3234.22s -> 3236.62s]  Where is he?
[3236.62s -> 3245.88s]  He's in the game.
[3245.88s -> 3246.52s]  He's in the game.
[3249.87s -> 3250.27s]  Where is he?
[3261.28s -> 3262.24s]  So he is in the game.
[3262.24s -> 3262.56s]  Wow.
[3270.81s -> 3272.41s]  I could probably do that if I tried hard enough.
[3274.73s -> 3287.58s]  All right, now we've got to cinematically walk him back to his car.
[3289.74s -> 3291.42s]  Oh, we actually do.
[3304.76s -> 3306.84s]  I think this is just supposed to happen, right?
[3315.92s -> 3317.68s]  If we go on the right, is this supposed to be okay?
[3321.44s -> 3321.92s]  Uh-oh.
[3323.04s -> 3323.76s]  Wildlife.
[3327.93s -> 3329.13s]  We're being hunted by wolves.
[3335.61s -> 3336.97s]  Who's going to distract them?
[3336.97s -> 3338.49s]  All right, we got to get to the horses.
[3339.29s -> 3340.81s]  Keep the wolves away from both of them.
[3342.41s -> 3347.20s]  That's just not going to work.
[3363.96s -> 3365.64s]  No, it takes it off cinematic mode.
[3366.60s -> 3370.24s]  Oh, well, we tried.
[3384.00s -> 3384.64s]  Get him on the horse.
[3384.64s -> 3385.52s]  You can see he's going to drive him.
[3387.90s -> 3392.20s]  Do first person mode.
[3392.20s -> 3393.32s]  That's actually a good idea, too.
[3397.93s -> 3398.17s]  Okay.
[3404.27s -> 3404.83s]  Where is he?
[3407.40s -> 3407.88s]  Oh, shit.
[3409.23s -> 3410.51s]  All right, yee-haw.
[3410.51s -> 3411.55s]  We're kind of going to yee-haw.
[3419.72s -> 3421.64s]  Please don't commit to this.
[3421.64s -> 3422.84s]  I'm not committing to it.
[3422.92s -> 3423.72s]  Now or later.
[3423.72s -> 3425.96s]  Are you going to die?
[3425.96s -> 3432.44s]  This is not very cinematic.
[3433.08s -> 3438.36s]  Up there?
[3438.36s -> 3439.48s]  More of them!
[3445.02s -> 3450.94s]  Get out of here!
[3450.94s -> 3455.80s]  Shit, there's more on the right!
[3455.80s -> 3462.84s]  That ragged off.
[3462.84s -> 3463.72s]  Do you see any more, Arthur?
[3463.72s -> 3465.02s]  I don't think so.
[3465.82s -> 3466.94s]  Jesus.
[3466.94s -> 3468.38s]  He just buried his face in the ground.
[3468.38s -> 3469.26s]  Just slid.
[3469.26s -> 3470.38s]  Just about.
[3470.38s -> 3471.82s]  You're going to be okay.
[3471.82s -> 3473.26s]  We have some shelter now.
[3473.26s -> 3473.66s]  All right, we're good.
[3473.66s -> 3475.34s]  Thanks for coming for me.
[3475.34s -> 3475.66s]  Of course.
[3475.66s -> 3476.86s]  Is this the portal soundtrack?
[3476.86s -> 3478.06s]  That bullet in Blackwater.
[3478.06s -> 3478.62s]  Now this.
[3478.62s -> 3479.26s]  I don't think so.
[3479.26s -> 3480.54s]  You had a hell of a time.
[3480.54s -> 3481.90s]  And Arthur always says,
[3483.02s -> 3483.58s]  I'm lucky.
[3484.46s -> 3486.14s]  None of us are lucky right now.
[3486.14s -> 3488.14s]  It's really crazy that John Marsden's in this game
[3488.14s -> 3490.14s]  and he just becomes Darth Vader in the next one.
[3491.18s -> 3492.78s]  You get to see his origin story here.
[3492.78s -> 3493.26s]  That's really cool.
[3493.26s -> 3494.78s]  Ride in the water for a bit.
[3494.78s -> 3495.82s]  Try to lose a cent.
[3496.54s -> 3498.78s]  Don't want to leave a trail right back to camp.
[3498.78s -> 3501.50s]  You know, we're going to need to come up with
[3501.50s -> 3503.50s]  a better story for that scar.
[3504.38s -> 3507.98s]  So, freezing, bleeding, starving.
[3508.86s -> 3510.38s]  Damn, they're getting even to death.
[3510.38s -> 3511.58s]  They're good enough for you.
[3513.72s -> 3515.08s]  Dude, oops.
[3520.36s -> 3521.40s]  We're good.
[3521.40s -> 3522.12s]  I did it.
[3522.12s -> 3522.60s]  I made it.
[3532.94s -> 3533.66s]  Super horse.
[3534.38s -> 3546.22s]  Can I scream too?
[3546.22s -> 3546.70s]  Does it help?
[3554.83s -> 3555.33s]  Help.
[3558.20s -> 3559.16s]  One, two, three.
[3567.24s -> 3568.52s]  Even by your standards.
[3569.56s -> 3570.36s]  Thank you, Arthur.
[3570.92s -> 3571.48s]  Thank you.
[3571.48s -> 3574.12s]  Any other lost maidens need saving?
[3575.08s -> 3575.72s]  Not today.
[3576.44s -> 3579.48s]  Have you and Dutch talked about how we're gonna get out of this?
[3579.48s -> 3582.12s]  I was just discussing with Herr Strauss
[3582.12s -> 3583.00s]  when the weather breaks.
[3583.00s -> 3585.08s]  I suppose we'll have to keep heading east.
[3585.08s -> 3585.80s]  East?
[3585.80s -> 3586.52s]  Into all that?
[3587.32s -> 3588.60s]  That civilization.
[3588.60s -> 3589.08s]  I know.
[3589.80s -> 3592.12s]  The west is where our problems are worse.
[3592.12s -> 3593.00s]  The west.
[3593.00s -> 3594.20s]  Come on, Herr Strauss.
[3594.20s -> 3595.40s]  Let's get warm.
[3595.40s -> 3596.44s]  Thank you, Mr. Morgan.
[3597.64s -> 3600.08s]  You've never seen this game before?
[3600.08s -> 3601.12s]  Is it on the Sega Genesis?
[3616.94s -> 3618.54s]  I was just gonna scream, yes.
[3618.54s -> 3619.50s]  But I'm not a screamer.
[3626.49s -> 3629.21s]  Events and interesting locations are noted in your journal as you explore.
[3629.21s -> 3631.05s]  Hold W to view.
[3632.09s -> 3633.53s]  Hold X for details.
[3634.49s -> 3638.48s]  Log.
[3638.48s -> 3639.12s]  Enter.
[3639.12s -> 3639.84s]  Pursue by memory.
[3639.84s -> 3642.32s]  John hasn't returned from an earlier scouting trip.
[3642.32s -> 3645.92s]  Arthur and Javier ride out into the snow to look for him.
[3646.72s -> 3647.12s]  Okay.
[3648.00s -> 3648.84s]  Checklist.
[3648.84s -> 3650.28s]  Kill all the wolves without taking any damage.
[3650.28s -> 3652.12s]  Complete what Elise 80 didn't do either of those.
[3653.32s -> 3654.70s]  That's all right.
[3654.70s -> 3655.42s]  Let's take a look at this.
[3656.14s -> 3656.86s]  Here's the journal.
[3658.78s -> 3661.08s]  That's very bad drawing.
[3661.88s -> 3665.52s]  You know when somebody asks you for directions
[3666.48s -> 3668.48s]  and you draw them a terrible map of intersections?
[3669.20s -> 3670.40s]  What's it just looks like?
[3676.01s -> 3676.81s]  Uh, okay.
[3680.89s -> 3682.09s]  I just draw in here, too?
[3683.69s -> 3684.49s]  What is this book?
[3685.21s -> 3691.02s]  Why would I not use this piece of paper on the left?
[3691.98s -> 3692.94s]  It's a waste of trees.
[3695.26s -> 3696.06s]  Is this the White House?
[3702.73s -> 3703.37s]  Oh, okay.
[3703.37s -> 3704.09s]  Blacksmithing.
[3707.12s -> 3707.92s]  I can't read this.
[3708.88s -> 3713.66s]  Oh, thank God it can be translated.
[3718.27s -> 3718.99s]  That's kind of cool.
[3723.85s -> 3725.85s]  Continue playing to unlock your bonus content.
[3726.75s -> 3728.75s]  Oh, I'm one of the suckers that spent $80
[3728.75s -> 3730.99s]  to get like the one mission that nobody else gets.
[3733.85s -> 3735.69s]  I feel real great about that part, just by the way.
[3736.33s -> 3746.09s]  All right.
[3746.09s -> 3746.65s]  Let's just go.
[3746.65s -> 3747.53s]  Let's just do some shit.
[3748.09s -> 3752.59s]  We got our mini-map here.
[3753.39s -> 3758.54s]  Got a horse, yeah.
[3762.57s -> 3763.53s]  Hold L2 to talk.
[3764.17s -> 3771.47s]  33-year-old substitute teacher can't read cursive.
[3781.79s -> 3785.96s]  Let's go.
[3788.51s -> 3790.43s]  I haven't been a substitute teacher in a long time.
[3793.02s -> 3793.42s]  All right.
[3793.42s -> 3794.14s]  All right, let's talk.
[3794.14s -> 3794.78s]  L2, greet.
[3797.74s -> 3798.70s]  Another cold morning.
[3808.92s -> 3809.40s]  What?
[3809.40s -> 3810.75s]  What is it doing?
[3810.75s -> 3816.36s]  Wait, why did it make me get off
[3816.36s -> 3817.32s]  for it to go to the bathroom?
[3817.32s -> 3817.96s]  Get over here.
[3818.68s -> 3819.72s]  What are you doing?
[3819.72s -> 3820.22s]  Hey!
[3821.56s -> 3822.04s]  Come here.
[3822.52s -> 3823.48s]  Come back here.
[3824.20s -> 3824.84s]  What are you going?
[3829.80s -> 3830.68s]  All right.
[3830.68s -> 3831.16s]  Relax.
[3835.31s -> 3836.03s]  Shit and run.
[3840.57s -> 3842.33s]  I guess we need to B or P.
[3843.29s -> 3844.25s]  Let's just do wits right here.
[3844.25s -> 3844.81s]  Let's just do P.
[3856.03s -> 3858.27s]  Couple of days on the lamb.
[3858.27s -> 3859.31s]  You lot have all turned yellow.
[3859.31s -> 3860.19s]  B or P?
[3860.19s -> 3861.71s]  Apart from you, of course.
[3861.71s -> 3862.59s]  Shut up, Micah.
[3862.59s -> 3865.07s]  I ain't never seen so many long faces.
[3866.59s -> 3869.23s]  I guess, I guess folks miss them.
[3869.23s -> 3869.79s]  I fell.
[3869.79s -> 3872.03s]  But when I fall, I don't want no fuss.
[3872.03s -> 3874.03s]  When you fall, there'll be a party.
[3876.03s -> 3876.91s]  A party?
[3877.71s -> 3878.27s]  Probably.
[3879.15s -> 3879.87s]  Funny, huh?
[3880.67s -> 3881.07s]  Sure.
[3881.87s -> 3888.11s]  I don't feel like being laughed at by the likes of you two.
[3888.11s -> 3888.75s]  Stop it.
[3889.39s -> 3889.71s]  Now.
[3890.43s -> 3892.35s]  You fools punching each other
[3892.35s -> 3894.83s]  when Como Driscoll's needing punching.
[3894.83s -> 3895.47s]  Hard.
[3895.47s -> 3897.87s]  You want to sit around waiting for him to come find us?
[3898.43s -> 3899.15s]  All of you.
[3899.15s -> 3900.43s]  We got work to do.
[3900.43s -> 3901.47s]  All right, I have the team mission.
[3901.47s -> 3902.83s]  You sure about this, Dutch?
[3902.83s -> 3903.39s]  Yes.
[3903.39s -> 3905.15s]  Folks been through a lot recently.
[3905.15s -> 3906.83s]  We hardly back on our feet yet.
[3906.83s -> 3910.43s]  The last thing we need is to get bushwhacked by Como Driscoll.
[3911.39s -> 3913.23s]  I know you hate him, Dutch.
[3913.23s -> 3914.75s]  He's here for us.
[3914.75s -> 3915.79s]  I doubt that.
[3915.79s -> 3917.23s]  No, you're just doubting me.
[3917.87s -> 3919.55s]  I would never doubt you, Dutch.
[3919.55s -> 3924.59s]  You always said revenge is a luxury we can't afford.
[3924.59s -> 3926.83s]  This is a right call, Arthur.
[3926.83s -> 3927.79s]  Take this.
[3927.79s -> 3930.19s]  Why does he just sound like a pitch-shifted version of him?
[3932.91s -> 3937.44s]  They were talking about trains, detonators.
[3937.44s -> 3937.68s]  Here.
[3938.48s -> 3942.24s]  Como always had good information.
[3942.24s -> 3942.72s]  Come on.
[3943.28s -> 3946.88s]  And you think now is the right time to hit a train.
[3946.88s -> 3950.80s]  Now you, my fancy living on deer piss and rabbit shit.
[3951.60s -> 3953.36s]  I'm getting too old for that life.
[3954.08s -> 3958.00s]  Mr. Matthews, Mr. Smith, Mr. Pearson.
[3958.00s -> 3962.00s]  Would you please look after the place there are Driscolls about?
[3962.56s -> 3963.76s]  Voice crack, voice crack.
[3963.76s -> 3964.96s]  How everyone laugh at him, right?
[3964.96s -> 3966.16s]  That's what you laugh at me.
[3968.32s -> 3969.84s]  That guy's way stronger than all of you.
[3975.64s -> 3977.08s]  Everybody pointed out in the chat, right?
[3984.03s -> 3984.59s]  We're going to go.
[3984.59s -> 3985.31s]  This is a robbery.
[3987.71s -> 3988.51s]  Automatic cinematic.
[3988.51s -> 3989.07s]  I didn't even do it.
[3989.87s -> 3992.84s]  Somebody turn on the AC.
[3992.84s -> 3993.88s]  It's getting hot in here.
[3993.88s -> 3994.76s]  Automatic cinematic.
[3997.60s -> 3999.36s]  I'll scold myself for that one later in the shower.
[3999.36s -> 4000.40s]  I promise.
[4000.40s -> 4007.63s]  I'm sorry.
[4007.63s -> 4008.99s]  I've been away for like three weeks.
[4009.71s -> 4015.40s]  I'm going to be in the shower being like with my hand up,
[4015.40s -> 4017.16s]  wicked hot water just going like,
[4017.16s -> 4018.12s]  fucking stupid.
[4019.10s -> 4021.26s]  Don't ever say something like that again.
[4021.26s -> 4026.86s]  It must be this way.
[4029.79s -> 4031.15s]  You good, Dutch?
[4031.15s -> 4036.54s]  Listen, I know you don't think much of my eyes recently,
[4036.54s -> 4038.46s]  but this is the right move.
[4038.46s -> 4039.29s]  Okay.
[4039.29s -> 4039.77s]  Debatable.
[4040.91s -> 4041.39s]  You know I'm going to be back.
[4041.39s -> 4042.51s]  Screaming in the shower.
[4042.51s -> 4047.24s]  You learned a long time ago that you hit Como Driscolls.
[4047.24s -> 4048.44s]  No drop frames, by the way.
[4048.44s -> 4051.64s]  I get to get out of meltdown modem into fun, fun mode.
[4051.64s -> 4057.34s]  This feud between you needs to be put to rest.
[4057.34s -> 4065.92s]  One way or things I can forgive, I can forget.
[4065.92s -> 4070.73s]  What he did to Hannibal, I can't deny it.
[4070.73s -> 4075.69s]  For me to pull off on another like audibly upset.
[4075.69s -> 4078.17s]  You know, like the difference when somebody's like,
[4078.17s -> 4079.05s]  oh, I'm pissed off.
[4079.05s -> 4080.09s]  What the heck, man?
[4080.09s -> 4082.25s]  Whoa, I can't believe I died there.
[4082.25s -> 4083.05s]  What's happening here?
[4083.05s -> 4083.85s]  Oh, damn it.
[4084.57s -> 4085.61s]  First, when you start talking like this,
[4086.73s -> 4087.93s]  like this fucking stupid fucking thing.
[4087.93s -> 4089.85s]  Like when you, that's how you know somebody's really angry.
[4090.49s -> 4092.17s]  They get like kind of internally,
[4092.17s -> 4093.45s]  they're so hot and they're nervous and shit.
[4093.45s -> 4094.81s]  Like they start fucking getting angry like that.
[4095.61s -> 4096.65s]  It's not like, what the fuck?
[4096.65s -> 4098.17s]  Whoa, I died in the game.
[4098.17s -> 4099.13s]  Oh, I'm so mad.
[4100.57s -> 4108.43s]  Whoa.
[4108.43s -> 4113.79s]  Are we birds?
[4113.79s -> 4114.59s]  All right, gentlemen.
[4115.66s -> 4116.86s]  This is it.
[4116.86s -> 4121.69s]  We goddamn ready.
[4121.69s -> 4122.73s]  Ready, Dutch.
[4122.73s -> 4123.53s]  Good.
[4123.53s -> 4124.49s]  That was very, very good.
[4124.49s -> 4125.53s]  That was like a classroom attendance.
[4125.53s -> 4128.80s]  Miss Morgan and I, we're going to head up here a little.
[4128.80s -> 4131.12s]  See if we can't get a sense of the layout of the camp.
[4132.08s -> 4133.84s]  Mr. Williamson, Mr. Bell.
[4134.48s -> 4137.20s]  You two take up a hidden position just outside the camp.
[4137.92s -> 4140.64s]  Mr. Summers, Mr. Escuela.
[4140.64s -> 4142.96s]  You two hold position here.
[4144.32s -> 4145.23s]  Let's go.
[4149.69s -> 4150.17s]  All right.
[4154.11s -> 4154.75s]  All right.
[4154.75s -> 4155.55s]  Throw haymaker.
[4156.64s -> 4157.44s]  I'm depleting.
[4162.06s -> 4163.90s]  This is absolutely beautiful.
[4163.90s -> 4165.02s]  You know, this is beautiful.
[4166.81s -> 4173.74s]  It's just beautiful out here.
[4173.74s -> 4174.94s]  That was at the same time.
[4180.36s -> 4182.44s]  Holy shit, this is what it looks like to look through his eyes.
[4182.44s -> 4183.08s]  I think so.
[4183.08s -> 4184.20s]  Got to go to a doctor, man.
[4185.08s -> 4185.96s]  Get into prescription.
[4186.84s -> 4191.53s]  You got astigmatism, bro.
[4192.49s -> 4196.83s]  All right.
[4196.83s -> 4198.11s]  Head shot from all the way back here.
[4198.67s -> 4208.14s]  What was wrong with that one?
[4228.97s -> 4229.52s]  All right.
[4229.52s -> 4230.56s]  So we're going to sneak up.
[4231.60s -> 4234.00s]  Metal Gear Solid 3, neck snap.
[4234.00s -> 4234.40s]  Two of them.
[4238.43s -> 4240.81s]  I was hoping I could see his big eyes.
[4241.45s -> 4242.97s]  Like Macaulay Culkin style.
[4254.40s -> 4257.36s]  Weapons not set on your load before dismounting will remain on your horse.
[4259.68s -> 4263.56s]  All right.
[4263.56s -> 4265.95s]  So we got new...
[4265.95s -> 4266.51s]  Hold on.
[4266.51s -> 4267.23s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[4267.23s -> 4270.17s]  Approach your horse to view store.
[4270.17s -> 4271.05s]  Hold L.
[4271.05s -> 4271.45s]  Do it.
[4272.09s -> 4272.99s]  Okay.
[4272.99s -> 4275.28s]  So where's the rifle?
[4275.92s -> 4277.77s]  Right here.
[4278.49s -> 4282.33s]  Long arm back carbine or carbine repeater.
[4284.70s -> 4286.06s]  Oh, that's just the slot it's in.
[4286.06s -> 4286.30s]  Okay.
[4286.70s -> 4287.18s]  I get it.
[4287.82s -> 4289.50s]  And I'll take the shotgun too.
[4294.86s -> 4295.90s]  Horse weapons.
[4295.90s -> 4300.03s]  We'll circle around the far side and go down that way.
[4300.03s -> 4300.99s]  Same as Micah.
[4300.99s -> 4301.47s]  Ten cents.
[4301.47s -> 4301.95s]  Yeah, that's...
[4301.95s -> 4302.51s]  I probably should.
[4303.79s -> 4304.75s]  I'll get it right eventually.
[4304.75s -> 4306.03s]  We can't afford.
[4306.03s -> 4306.67s]  Yeah.
[4306.67s -> 4309.07s]  Just wasn't sure you agreed with me.
[4309.71s -> 4310.83s]  Does it stay winter the whole game?
[4310.83s -> 4313.79s]  Arthur, have you completely lost faith in me?
[4313.79s -> 4319.07s]  Our needs right now are supplies, equipment, and a way out of here.
[4319.79s -> 4322.03s]  Everything else, including coal.
[4323.48s -> 4323.96s]  Okay.
[4324.68s -> 4327.80s]  There's enough of those bastards down there to deal with as it is.
[4328.68s -> 4331.07s]  All right.
[4331.07s -> 4332.43s]  So we're going to go carbine.
[4335.76s -> 4336.96s]  Not every area is snow.
[4337.60s -> 4339.68s]  Well, it's good at least that they put it in.
[4340.48s -> 4344.17s]  It's not just the desert and only the desert.
[4347.90s -> 4349.66s]  Take a shot every time somebody says okay.
[4354.11s -> 4354.43s]  All right.
[4354.43s -> 4355.47s]  No fucking around here.
[4355.47s -> 4357.87s]  No like look at how funny the streamer is jokes here.
[4358.75s -> 4359.88s]  You know what I'm saying?
[4359.88s -> 4360.76s]  And we already got that.
[4360.76s -> 4361.88s]  We got a cinematic mode.
[4361.88s -> 4362.60s]  Oh, LML.
[4362.60s -> 4364.04s]  And then, oh, I fell off three times.
[4365.00s -> 4366.44s]  And then, you know, I'm not doing that again.
[4374.92s -> 4382.72s]  Can they see us?
[4382.72s -> 4390.01s]  I should be crouched.
[4390.01s -> 4390.81s]  I can't do it here.
[4390.81s -> 4392.73s]  This is such a long walk down.
[4392.73s -> 4397.21s]  Wait till I get the game to open up for me before I do any dumb shit.
[4411.12s -> 4412.40s]  What a terrible stream.
[4412.40s -> 4414.16s]  Hey, what?
[4415.44s -> 4415.76s]  Why?
[4415.76s -> 4416.32s]  What happened?
[4417.04s -> 4418.24s]  I'm just playing Red Dead.
[4422.33s -> 4423.13s]  Just jump off.
[4423.13s -> 4434.27s]  No, one guy said that.
[4435.92s -> 4436.16s]  Yeah.
[4436.16s -> 4437.60s]  And he's the one guy now.
[4439.20s -> 4440.96s]  Why do I always read negative feedback?
[4440.96s -> 4442.88s]  Gosh, I need to make sure everyone's happy.
[4442.88s -> 4445.76s]  And if people are not having fun, then I want to make sure you're having fun.
[4457.21s -> 4458.25s]  I really can't fuck this up.
[4464.06s -> 4465.26s]  I got to be on point here.
[4466.38s -> 4467.98s]  No, like where's the shed?
[4469.16s -> 4470.20s]  Is that the shed?
[4470.20s -> 4471.48s]  Am I not dropping frames?
[4471.48s -> 4472.12s]  I don't know.
[4477.58s -> 4478.30s]  Is that a guy?
[4478.30s -> 4479.02s]  No, that's a good guy.
[4489.90s -> 4490.54s]  Take the lead.
[4492.30s -> 4493.58s]  He's giving me an opportunity.
[4495.92s -> 4497.76s]  Look at Dutch to give instructions.
[4502.11s -> 4502.99s]  Send in the gang.
[4502.99s -> 4503.71s]  I'll take the lead.
[4518.19s -> 4521.52s]  Wait, does the sniper elite thing?
[4528.84s -> 4529.16s]  Damn it.
[4529.80s -> 4540.84s]  Having R2 when not aiming.
[4540.84s -> 4541.08s]  Okay.
[4542.28s -> 4544.17s]  This is the last guy.
[4544.17s -> 4545.61s]  Up on top of the roof.
[4545.61s -> 4546.17s]  Don't fall.
[4546.17s -> 4547.37s]  Oops, sorry.
[4547.37s -> 4548.33s]  That guy was making a video.
[4549.90s -> 4551.26s]  I should have been quiet.
[4551.26s -> 4552.22s]  That guy was like recording.
[4553.10s -> 4555.18s]  He's definitely like laughing and like screaming right now.
[4556.54s -> 4561.39s]  Get over there.
[4561.47s -> 4570.89s]  Fucking sensitivity.
[4571.61s -> 4575.63s]  Lord.
[4575.63s -> 4581.56s]  I got somebody.
[4582.12s -> 4582.36s]  How?
[4582.36s -> 4582.92s]  I'm not sure.
[4599.37s -> 4600.09s]  Right through his hat.
[4600.81s -> 4604.60s]  One more guy.
[4604.60s -> 4605.00s]  Where is he?
[4605.00s -> 4605.32s]  Right here?
[4606.12s -> 4607.80s]  Oh, he just got me right in the mouth.
[4608.36s -> 4610.20s]  He shot me right in the face.
[4612.52s -> 4629.55s]  I'm glad you're getting shot right in the face like that.
[4630.83s -> 4631.63s]  They're really just walled.
[4632.67s -> 4643.31s]  Damn it.
[4643.31s -> 4650.08s]  I could just be dead.
[4650.08s -> 4650.24s]  What?
[4650.24s -> 4651.28s]  Why did I shoot twice?
[4651.28s -> 4652.32s]  Oh, that was the slow motion.
[4656.48s -> 4657.12s]  FP.
[4657.12s -> 4658.24s]  Oh, all right.
[4658.24s -> 4659.68s]  Is this 90 FOV though?
[4660.88s -> 4664.16s]  This just makes me want this to be on PC.
[4665.04s -> 4665.28s]  All right.
[4665.28s -> 4669.26s]  There's so many corpses though.
[4669.26s -> 4670.06s]  How am I going to get them all?
[4671.98s -> 4677.60s]  There is a slider in the menu.
[4679.31s -> 4679.71s]  Is there?
[4684.80s -> 4684.96s]  What?
[4684.96s -> 4685.44s]  A camera?
[4686.91s -> 4687.63s]  Or they aren't?
[4687.63s -> 4687.87s]  Okay.
[4687.87s -> 4688.11s]  Yeah.
[4688.11s -> 4688.43s]  Okay.
[4688.43s -> 4688.91s]  It is there.
[4691.52s -> 4693.44s]  Get that fucking head bob off, please.
[4694.32s -> 4696.28s]  All right.
[4696.28s -> 4696.52s]  Cool.
[4697.16s -> 4699.56s]  Is it a fly immediately?
[4699.56s -> 4710.43s]  Actually, no FOV number.
[4710.43s -> 4711.87s]  It's just this one.
[4713.80s -> 4714.12s]  Bar.
[4714.76s -> 4716.04s]  Bar drag to the edge.
[4716.68s -> 4727.00s]  Oh, hey, hey, hey.
[4727.00s -> 4728.20s]  More of them are coming in right now.
[4728.76s -> 4729.96s]  I didn't need a chance to loot.
[4730.76s -> 4736.43s]  First person.
[4737.07s -> 4750.89s]  Well, aiming sure is a thousand times better in first person.
[4750.89s -> 4752.25s]  I will definitely say that.
[4753.37s -> 4762.24s]  I'll say that.
[4773.24s -> 4773.72s]  Defend.
[4774.52s -> 4775.00s]  Is there?
[4775.00s -> 4776.04s]  Is there a dead eye in this game?
[4776.92s -> 4783.61s]  Damn.
[4797.48s -> 4798.75s]  Oh, there is dead eye.
[4798.75s -> 4799.87s]  I can even like see it.
[4802.08s -> 4802.64s]  Oh, shit.
[4806.06s -> 4806.78s]  Got that guy.
[4806.78s -> 4807.66s]  He's dead.
[4807.66s -> 4809.58s]  I don't have to worry about him causing any problems.
[4839.28s -> 4839.68s]  God.
[4844.12s -> 4845.08s]  I don't like that.
[4845.08s -> 4846.04s]  I didn't like that.
[4846.04s -> 4847.08s]  Holy shit.
[4856.41s -> 4857.05s]  Holy fuck.
[4857.05s -> 4858.17s]  That was insane.
[4862.28s -> 4862.84s]  All right.
[4867.90s -> 4868.46s]  New.
[4868.46s -> 4869.02s]  Oh, here we go.
[4869.02s -> 4869.66s]  Weapon wheel.
[4870.30s -> 4871.55s]  Dead eye tonics.
[4871.55s -> 4872.75s]  Fully restores dead eye.
[4872.75s -> 4873.07s]  Okay.
[4873.71s -> 4874.91s]  You release to use them.
[4875.63s -> 4877.76s]  Hides your identity while committing crimes.
[4878.48s -> 4881.16s]  Okay.
[4881.16s -> 4882.36s]  Let's bring it right back up.
[4882.36s -> 4882.52s]  All right.
[4882.52s -> 4883.32s]  Let's keep looking around.
[4883.32s -> 4884.44s]  I got this many bodies.
[4885.48s -> 4886.52s]  Do it with the shotgun.
[4889.61s -> 4889.93s]  Lord.
[4890.65s -> 4891.93s]  He didn't like it.
[4891.93s -> 4892.81s]  He loved it.
[4893.69s -> 4898.88s]  They're probably going to keep coming over here.
[4898.88s -> 4899.84s]  I guess I have to do it.
[4900.56s -> 4909.93s]  Is this like you can actually cut people's heads off in the game?
[4911.07s -> 4911.71s]  My lord.
[4912.43s -> 4918.08s]  Shoot the bodies with the shotgun.
[4928.04s -> 4929.24s]  Oh, man.
[4933.32s -> 4934.04s]  No way.
[4936.84s -> 4938.04s]  No fucking way.
[4938.04s -> 4939.08s]  There's like this.
[4939.08s -> 4940.28s]  That's that's insane.
[4943.18s -> 4945.18s]  That's it's just it's brutal.
[4946.06s -> 4946.86s]  Oh, man.
[4946.86s -> 4948.30s]  It's bruises brutal.
[4950.27s -> 4951.79s]  This game ain't coming out in Germany.
[4952.81s -> 4953.61s]  Like no way.
[4954.41s -> 4958.24s]  This game ain't going to release in Japan.
[4967.84s -> 4968.40s]  Is it all right?
[4968.40s -> 4969.92s]  Is it out in like Germany and Japan?
[4971.63s -> 4972.19s]  What do they do?
[4985.88s -> 4986.44s]  It is out.
[4986.44s -> 4986.68s]  Okay.
[4991.74s -> 4993.98s]  Blood confirmed it is out in Germany as is.
[4995.82s -> 5000.59s]  Well, hold on.
[5000.59s -> 5001.95s]  Yeah, I have to loot everybody.
[5001.95s -> 5003.55s]  You can't give me all these exes here.
[5010.09s -> 5011.85s]  Got somebody's belt buckle.
[5016.88s -> 5018.00s]  I will but just hold on.
[5018.00s -> 5019.60s]  There's a lot that could be money on everybody.
[5023.61s -> 5024.41s]  89 cents.
[5025.13s -> 5026.65s]  I'm just collecting bits right now.
[5027.47s -> 5028.19s]  What does this guy have?
[5028.19s -> 5029.15s]  What does this guy have on him?
[5030.76s -> 5033.72s]  Hey, thank you for the championship belt.
[5036.99s -> 5037.55s]  Big bits.
[5037.55s -> 5037.95s]  All right.
[5037.95s -> 5039.63s]  We'll look for like like come on.
[5039.63s -> 5040.11s]  What do you got?
[5041.72s -> 5044.46s]  No, that guy's not even that guy's not a sub.
[5045.10s -> 5046.56s]  Come on.
[5046.56s -> 5047.60s]  We don't even have like a sub.
[5056.62s -> 5057.26s]  What?
[5057.26s -> 5060.80s]  How many people here aren't even shocked?
[5061.36s -> 5064.01s]  All right.
[5064.01s -> 5064.97s]  I gotta cut that out.
[5071.84s -> 5073.20s]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[5074.00s -> 5074.32s]  All right.
[5074.32s -> 5078.06s]  We got here.
[5078.06s -> 5079.02s]  He's onto it.
[5080.57s -> 5082.17s]  Because he's I'm just I'm not.
[5082.17s -> 5085.13s]  No, I don't I don't care if you aren't subscribed.
[5087.05s -> 5087.53s]  Don't worry.
[5090.43s -> 5095.96s]  Chewing tobacco.
[5095.96s -> 5096.20s]  Cool.
[5099.08s -> 5100.20s]  Pressuring fans.
[5100.92s -> 5102.46s]  No, you guys know that.
[5102.46s -> 5103.74s]  It's not I don't care.
[5104.38s -> 5110.48s]  Oh, there's an upper left.
[5110.48s -> 5112.00s]  Oh, there's a fortnight chest up here.
[5112.64s -> 5113.76s]  What's in here?
[5113.76s -> 5114.64s]  Epic.
[5114.64s -> 5115.44s]  Is it an epic?
[5119.07s -> 5119.63s]  Holy shit.
[5119.63s -> 5127.63s]  Somebody's hey, the great Lord Walden just gave out 20 tier one community subs.
[5127.63s -> 5128.51s]  Thank you.
[5128.51s -> 5130.04s]  Thank you so much, dude.
[5130.60s -> 5136.99s]  Okay, 20, 20 subs here from Walden.
[5136.99s -> 5137.47s]  Thanks, man.
[5142.09s -> 5142.81s]  Oh, my Lord.
[5142.81s -> 5144.73s]  No, no, that's not this is not what.
[5144.73s -> 5146.41s]  Thank you for the 10 subs after it.
[5148.28s -> 5148.76s]  Thank you.
[5154.43s -> 5155.63s]  Oh, here it comes.
[5158.33s -> 5161.72s]  I just can't keep my mouth shut.
[5162.52s -> 5163.48s]  But thank you guys.
[5164.36s -> 5165.16s]  Unnecessary.
[5165.16s -> 5166.04s]  But thank you.
[5166.68s -> 5170.30s]  All right.
[5170.30s -> 5171.18s]  I gotta search up here.
[5171.74s -> 5174.41s]  There's still things that I need to get.
[5174.41s -> 5178.03s]  Okay, that hurt.
[5178.03s -> 5179.77s]  What else is in here?
[5183.63s -> 5184.27s]  Sub.
[5184.27s -> 5185.31s]  Oh, there's a chest.
[5185.31s -> 5186.83s]  I told you there's a fortnight chest in here.
[5189.76s -> 5190.00s]  Take.
[5193.28s -> 5193.52s]  Take.
[5193.52s -> 5194.08s]  Is it a knife?
[5195.44s -> 5196.88s]  Two dollars and 12 cents.
[5198.75s -> 5200.43s]  And cigarettes.
[5204.94s -> 5205.18s]  Whoa.
[5209.40s -> 5210.04s]  What is it?
[5210.04s -> 5211.00s]  Is this dynamite?
[5211.00s -> 5211.16s]  What?
[5211.16s -> 5212.36s]  How would I even climb this?
[5218.94s -> 5219.90s]  This looks good.
[5220.92s -> 5222.20s]  What do you think, Bill?
[5222.20s -> 5223.16s]  Well, looks fine.
[5224.04s -> 5225.39s]  But thank you, though.
[5225.39s -> 5226.43s]  Those guys giving out those subs.
[5227.48s -> 5228.20s]  Really appreciate it.
[5230.75s -> 5232.27s]  Did we get everything?
[5232.27s -> 5233.07s]  Think so, boss.
[5233.71s -> 5235.15s]  Found this on one of them.
[5235.15s -> 5235.55s]  Thank you.
[5236.43s -> 5237.39s]  This is perfect.
[5238.19s -> 5239.23s]  Oh, yeah.
[5239.23s -> 5239.87s]  Interesting.
[5240.51s -> 5243.07s]  This is something about the train they was gonna rob.
[5243.07s -> 5243.63s]  Train mission.
[5243.63s -> 5244.11s]  I bought it.
[5244.11s -> 5245.15s]  It was 20 dollars.
[5245.15s -> 5246.75s]  Mr. Leviticus Cornwall.
[5247.55s -> 5248.67s]  Mount back up.
[5248.67s -> 5249.63s]  Let's keep moving.
[5252.64s -> 5254.24s]  What does dynamite smell like?
[5254.24s -> 5255.04s]  Alright, let's get out of here.
[5255.04s -> 5256.16s]  Proud of you, boys.
[5256.80s -> 5258.78s]  All of you.
[5258.78s -> 5259.26s]  Raisins.
[5260.06s -> 5261.77s]  No, that's tobacco.
[5261.77s -> 5262.97s]  Gunpowder smells like...
[5262.97s -> 5266.14s]  Not bad for some starving down in...
[5266.14s -> 5266.46s]  Uh.
[5266.46s -> 5267.82s]  They can pummel us.
[5267.82s -> 5269.24s]  Hard as they like.
[5269.24s -> 5270.44s]  It's hard to describe.
[5282.84s -> 5288.57s]  If you drop the frame, it's gonna happen.
[5288.57s -> 5290.17s]  I can't even get angry about it anymore.
[5294.01s -> 5297.69s]  You know, there's no sense crying over spilt milk.
[5297.69s -> 5298.81s]  Sorry, spilt.
[5298.81s -> 5300.17s]  It's just gonna happen.
[5300.17s -> 5303.05s]  Just, thankfully, it's not happening as frequently as it was at the beginning of the train.
[5303.77s -> 5307.50s]  You know, he'll come after us.
[5308.38s -> 5309.74s]  What do I think of the game so far?
[5309.74s -> 5309.98s]  Um.
[5309.98s -> 5311.58s]  Just like all the rest.
[5311.58s -> 5313.90s]  But we're gonna stay a step ahead of them.
[5313.90s -> 5316.44s]  Make sure we always know where they are.
[5316.44s -> 5317.64s]  It's very atmospheric.
[5317.64s -> 5318.84s]  Seems like it's gonna be really fun.
[5318.84s -> 5322.36s]  We allowed ourselves to get a step behind at Blackwater.
[5322.36s -> 5324.04s]  That won't happen again.
[5327.80s -> 5328.60s]  Even just that up there.
[5329.40s -> 5330.46s]  Looks great.
[5332.73s -> 5334.33s]  And we're just still in the tutorial, yeah.
[5334.97s -> 5336.33s]  There's way more going on.
[5336.33s -> 5337.53s]  Hang in, fellas.
[5337.53s -> 5338.81s]  Let's make some ground.
[5341.92s -> 5343.12s]  Cowboy Skyrim.
[5343.84s -> 5344.34s]  Yeah.
[5345.04s -> 5349.08s]  That's not a bad thing, though.
[5352.46s -> 5354.30s]  It really makes you feel like Spider-Man.
[5354.30s -> 5354.80s]  That's right.
[5364.99s -> 5367.53s]  Bring him back alive.
[5370.46s -> 5370.96s]  We got it.
[5372.41s -> 5374.81s]  Chase down and lasso old Driscoll.
[5376.01s -> 5379.98s]  So do I get the la-
[5379.98s -> 5381.18s]  Hold and get the weapon wheel.
[5381.18s -> 5383.50s]  This is gonna bring up is the lasso.
[5384.54s -> 5385.77s]  Okay.
[5385.77s -> 5388.17s]  Hold L2 to ready lasso and aim it at old Driscoll.
[5388.17s -> 5394.04s]  One of the most fun mechanics of the last game here it is.
[5408.91s -> 5410.67s]  Keep L2 held and dismount.
[5417.29s -> 5417.79s]  Press it.
[5418.65s -> 5431.37s]  Let's interrogate him in the water.
[5431.37s -> 5434.08s]  Let's drown this motherfucker.
[5434.80s -> 5439.82s]  He got out.
[5447.45s -> 5451.92s]  Where did he go?
[5455.92s -> 5459.68s]  Oh, he's uh, he actually is like getting drowned.
[5460.40s -> 5469.04s]  Give him a stone.
[5469.04s -> 5470.40s]  Yep, drop him on the back of the horse.
[5471.36s -> 5478.27s]  He might actually be able to drown.
[5480.08s -> 5480.58s]  Maybe.
[5483.28s -> 5483.78s]  Okay.
[5484.40s -> 5488.01s]  Yellow line in the radar is the shortest route.
[5490.09s -> 5491.05s]  In the yellow truck.
[5500.06s -> 5503.48s]  Press the thumb stick to pet the horse.
[5508.12s -> 5508.68s]  Yeah, I got him.
[5508.68s -> 5509.18s]  I pet him.
[5511.56s -> 5512.20s]  I gave him a little-
[5512.20s -> 5513.32s]  Hey, you're doing a great job.
[5518.35s -> 5518.85s]  Thank you.
[5524.30s -> 5525.94s]  Shut up.
[5526.32s -> 5540.49s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[5540.49s -> 5540.89s]  Where is it?
[5540.89s -> 5541.39s]  Come on.
[5542.01s -> 5542.51s]  Come on.
[5543.37s -> 5543.87s]  Come on.
[5551.69s -> 5552.49s]  Trying to shoot the bird.
[5553.13s -> 5556.68s]  Can you throw dynamite at birds in this game?
[5556.68s -> 5557.96s]  Does it follow them like in the last one?
[5565.15s -> 5565.55s]  What bird?
[5565.55s -> 5566.43s]  The bird that was on the right.
[5572.27s -> 5572.91s]  Yes, that does-
[5572.91s -> 5574.19s]  That is still in the game.
[5584.40s -> 5584.96s]  You can try.
[5584.96s -> 5586.24s]  I mean, we'll eventually we'll try.
[5603.24s -> 5604.92s]  Seeing birds from other dimensions now.
[5618.12s -> 5619.88s]  204 bones to go.
[5620.76s -> 5627.68s]  Bring him to the fire and drop him in.
[5628.94s -> 5629.98s]  We're eating good tonight.
[5637.12s -> 5638.48s]  Hold near your horse to remove him.
[5649.07s -> 5649.47s]  I would.
[5649.47s -> 5650.59s]  No, I can't right now.
[5650.59s -> 5651.47s]  We can't do that.
[5653.05s -> 5654.57s]  I'm not doing that whole thing again.
[5661.42s -> 5662.70s]  I thought I was going to start cutting him.
[5670.68s -> 5671.56s]  Uncle.
[5671.56s -> 5671.88s]  Mr.
[5671.88s -> 5672.44s]  Williamson.
[5673.08s -> 5675.48s]  Tie this maggot up someplace safe.
[5675.48s -> 5677.48s]  We get him hungry first.
[5677.48s -> 5679.16s]  I got a saying, my friend.
[5680.36s -> 5682.08s]  We shoot fellas.
[5682.08s -> 5682.96s]  There's no need shooting.
[5683.68s -> 5684.72s]  Save fellas.
[5684.72s -> 5685.60s]  There's no need saving.
[5686.16s -> 5687.36s]  And feed them.
[5687.36s -> 5688.32s]  There's no need feeding.
[5689.12s -> 5692.56s]  We are going to find out what you need.
[5692.56s -> 5695.05s]  I can't believe it.
[5695.77s -> 5698.01s]  An O'Driscoll in my camp.
[5698.01s -> 5699.37s]  I ain't an O'Driscoll, mister.
[5700.25s -> 5700.73s]  I ain't-
[5700.73s -> 5703.48s]  Oh, whatever you say, son.
[5704.36s -> 5705.64s]  Well done, Arthur.
[5705.64s -> 5707.82s]  I'm just sorry we missed out on call.
[5707.82s -> 5708.62s]  Why am I still holding them?
[5708.62s -> 5709.74s]  Well, there's time enough for that.
[5710.38s -> 5713.74s]  Now, I gotta figure out if we can hit that train.
[5714.70s -> 5715.10s]  Okay.
[5726.97s -> 5728.17s]  That's a long saying.
[5737.00s -> 5737.96s]  Old friends complete.
[5738.60s -> 5741.37s]  Now we got P on the map.
[5741.37s -> 5742.65s]  Oh, excuse me.
[5742.65s -> 5744.33s]  I probably got an F.
[5746.43s -> 5748.35s]  Complete the mission without taking any health items.
[5750.88s -> 5752.16s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[5752.16s -> 5753.76s]  I got a 25% on the test.
[5754.96s -> 5766.01s]  Now, let's keep going through the tutorial.
[5766.65s -> 5770.11s]  No, I don't-
[5770.11s -> 5771.15s]  I don't even need to get on the horse.
[5771.15s -> 5772.19s]  He's literally right here.
[5784.30s -> 5785.18s]  Stu, I'll take you.
[5785.18s -> 5786.86s]  I'm gonna starve to death up here, Mr. Morgan.
[5789.98s -> 5790.78s]  We're okay.
[5792.64s -> 5795.68s]  We have a few cans of food and a rabbit.
[5795.68s -> 5796.40s]  For what?
[5796.40s -> 5797.44s]  Ten, twelve people?
[5798.32s -> 5800.35s]  That was in the Navy.
[5800.35s -> 5804.03s]  I do not wish to hear about what you got up to in the Navy, Mr. Pearson.
[5805.31s -> 5806.67s]  We were stranded at sea.
[5807.47s -> 5808.91s]  For 50 days.
[5808.91s -> 5810.99s]  And you unfortunately survived.
[5812.27s -> 5816.89s]  When we ran away from Blackwater, I wasn't able to get supplies in.
[5817.85s -> 5818.73s]  Idiot streamer.
[5818.73s -> 5820.57s]  Idiot streamer.
[5820.57s -> 5823.45s]  Sometimes shopping trips need to be cut short.
[5824.09s -> 5824.97s]  We'll survive.
[5825.85s -> 5826.65s]  We always have.
[5827.61s -> 5829.69s]  If needs be, we can eat you.
[5829.69s -> 5830.57s]  You're the fattest.
[5831.45s -> 5833.85s]  I sent Lenny and Bill hunting and they found-
[5833.85s -> 5834.65s]  Ew, gross.
[5834.65s -> 5836.01s]  I mean, fucking disgusting.
[5836.97s -> 5839.58s]  Bill's a fool.
[5839.58s -> 5842.06s]  Unless those mountains are full of game they want to read,
[5842.06s -> 5843.98s]  ain't no wonder they found enough of this.
[5844.70s -> 5846.16s]  We'll go find something.
[5846.16s -> 5846.88s]  Come on, Arthur.
[5847.68s -> 5849.08s]  Wait a second.
[5849.08s -> 5849.58s]  Hold on.
[5851.48s -> 5851.98s]  Here.
[5852.52s -> 5854.24s]  You're gonna need something to eat out there.
[5855.12s -> 5856.64s]  The sordid salted off.
[5858.28s -> 5860.28s]  Starving will be preferable.
[5860.28s -> 5861.40s]  Come on, let's go.
[5861.40s -> 5865.96s]  Is it weird that these gross shit items that are in these games,
[5866.44s -> 5872.28s]  the rotten can of beans and packed in spam that's four years expired,
[5872.28s -> 5873.08s]  I want to eat them.
[5874.04s -> 5875.88s]  If I could pull that out of history and eat it,
[5875.88s -> 5876.92s]  I would probably do it right now.
[5885.80s -> 5887.08s]  Nobody else does that?
[5887.08s -> 5888.36s]  I can't use it and you'll have to.
[5889.82s -> 5890.62s]  Bow and arrow.
[5890.62s -> 5893.90s]  Use a gun and we'll scare off every animal for miles around.
[5895.10s -> 5896.22s]  You're never too old to learn.
[5897.10s -> 5897.74s]  I imagine.
[5898.38s -> 5898.94s]  You okay?
[5899.90s -> 5901.64s]  Yeah, yeah, man.
[5901.64s -> 5902.20s]  Let's head out.
[5903.00s -> 5903.81s]  Yeah.
[5904.51s -> 5914.32s]  Match the speed of your cockspill.
[5914.96s -> 5915.84s]  Stupid mistake.
[5917.84s -> 5919.20s]  It'll be fine in a day or two.
[5919.76s -> 5921.28s]  I just can't pull a bow right now.
[5922.00s -> 5928.46s]  Is that guy on YouTube that eats the old military rations?
[5929.02s -> 5929.90s]  Yeah, that channel's great.
[5932.59s -> 5939.07s]  I've put on that guy's channel and just fallen asleep to him eating old rations
[5939.07s -> 5941.63s]  and woken up at like 60 videos a player.
[5941.71s -> 5942.75s]  They'll be needing to feed.
[5944.03s -> 5948.80s]  I'm going to tap square when we're stationed from this move.
[5954.92s -> 5955.96s]  Oh, you can like hold it.
[5955.96s -> 5956.36s]  That's cool.
[5957.80s -> 5958.68s]  Is that just showing off?
[5966.99s -> 5967.79s]  I didn't wait.
[5967.79s -> 5968.67s]  I'm not saying what?
[5968.67s -> 5969.47s]  I didn't say that.
[5970.27s -> 5970.77s]  No.
[5978.36s -> 5979.64s]  I've done that to your videos.
[5979.64s -> 5980.14s]  Yeah.
[5980.84s -> 5981.34s]  Just happened.
[5995.63s -> 5996.99s]  Let's put this out on a tray.
[5997.79s -> 5998.99s]  Yeah, I know the line.
[5999.55s -> 6000.03s]  Come on.
[6000.03s -> 6001.23s]  You don't think I've ever seen it before?
[6020.38s -> 6021.66s]  Automatic cinematic.
[6031.93s -> 6034.01s]  Coffee instant cheetos.
[6035.85s -> 6036.81s]  Oh, God.
[6047.82s -> 6050.22s]  I wonder how big the actual map is when the game opens up.
[6050.22s -> 6053.34s]  It all is bad, but if it's too strong, they won't move.
[6053.34s -> 6061.34s]  Stay quiet.
[6061.34s -> 6062.38s]  Do a German impression?
[6062.94s -> 6063.44s]  Okay.
[6063.74s -> 6066.52s]  Stop here a second.
[6067.16s -> 6067.96s]  I see something.
[6068.60s -> 6071.96s]  I was about to just wildly make fun of myself.
[6071.96s -> 6073.32s]  Like just make fun of me.
[6074.44s -> 6075.40s]  No, I'm not doing that.
[6076.52s -> 6079.08s]  Why would I do?
[6079.08s -> 6079.58s]  No.
[6082.44s -> 6083.72s]  I've already done this before.
[6083.72s -> 6084.36s]  Recently.
[6084.36s -> 6086.20s]  How can you do?
[6087.72s -> 6088.60s]  I've already done it.
[6089.32s -> 6093.58s]  We'll track them on foot.
[6093.58s -> 6094.91s]  You're gonna need the book.
[6094.91s -> 6096.91s]  Don't leave it on your whole gun.
[6096.91s -> 6098.43s]  It'll scare everything around.
[6098.43s -> 6099.95s]  Approach your horse.
[6099.95s -> 6100.75s]  Don't use the gun.
[6101.63s -> 6111.02s]  So with Z, use L2R to select a stowed weapon.
[6111.98s -> 6112.70s]  Carbine.
[6112.70s -> 6113.10s]  Bow.
[6113.10s -> 6113.74s]  That's the one.
[6114.94s -> 6118.84s]  No point setting off without that bow.
[6118.84s -> 6120.36s]  You make less noise when you crouch.
[6120.36s -> 6121.08s]  And slowly.
[6123.26s -> 6124.46s]  I'm not gonna do it.
[6124.46s -> 6125.58s]  I'm not gonna shoot him in the head.
[6126.30s -> 6130.67s]  You see the tracks?
[6131.23s -> 6132.19s]  I think so.
[6132.99s -> 6134.27s]  Maybe not.
[6134.27s -> 6134.91s]  I see them.
[6135.71s -> 6138.60s]  You can use eagle eye to highlight animal tracks.
[6141.39s -> 6141.63s]  Okay.
[6142.72s -> 6143.60s]  Focus on the track.
[6145.26s -> 6152.12s]  Enable eagle eye focus on the tracks to highlight them again.
[6152.84s -> 6154.75s]  Okay.
[6154.75s -> 6155.23s]  Yeah, I can.
[6155.23s -> 6155.71s]  I see it.
[6163.00s -> 6166.04s]  Your scent is also shown in eagle eye blowing in the direction of the wind.
[6166.04s -> 6167.64s]  Animals will flee if they smell your scent.
[6167.64s -> 6169.88s]  They'll remain downwind or far away when hunting.
[6170.92s -> 6179.18s]  So is this...
[6179.18s -> 6180.46s]  Is that my smell going this way?
[6180.46s -> 6181.90s]  Or are those those of his tracks, right?
[6182.46s -> 6189.13s]  He's gonna be up here.
[6189.77s -> 6201.48s]  It's top track.
[6201.48s -> 6202.52s]  I mean, I'm just gonna follow it.
[6203.24s -> 6206.16s]  22 miles per hour.
[6206.16s -> 6206.96s]  Top right.
[6206.96s -> 6208.16s]  Which way is it going though?
[6211.28s -> 6211.76s]  This way.
[6219.13s -> 6220.25s]  Unknown animal.
[6220.25s -> 6220.97s]  It's gonna be a deer.
[6223.66s -> 6224.94s]  22 miles per hour.
[6224.94s -> 6226.06s]  That would be very...
[6226.06s -> 6226.86s]  That'd be a lot.
[6226.86s -> 6229.42s]  I don't see anything.
[6229.42s -> 6230.06s]  Oh, there it is.
[6230.06s -> 6230.56s]  Okay.
[6230.56s -> 6235.90s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[6235.90s -> 6236.78s]  Am I close enough?
[6237.42s -> 6243.15s]  I'm gonna have to do like a...
[6243.15s -> 6244.03s]  Is it bullet drop?
[6253.79s -> 6254.83s]  Aim for the head.
[6256.30s -> 6257.10s]  A swing.
[6257.98s -> 6266.00s]  Do I not go get the meat?
[6266.56s -> 6270.51s]  Hunt another deer.
[6270.51s -> 6271.01s]  Okay.
[6271.55s -> 6272.65s]  Well, I'm gonna...
[6272.65s -> 6273.77s]  I wanna get the meat here.
[6274.49s -> 6276.89s]  Select and call while aiming at it.
[6277.45s -> 6279.05s]  This will give you a chance of a clean kill
[6279.05s -> 6280.89s]  as they raise their head before fleeing.
[6281.69s -> 6285.58s]  So there's one over here.
[6289.34s -> 6290.06s]  All right.
[6290.06s -> 6292.14s]  Do I even need to lock that one?
[6292.14s -> 6299.50s]  I mean, we get the 21 stink meter up there.
[6304.51s -> 6304.83s]  Okay.
[6304.83s -> 6306.83s]  I haven't even played God of War,
[6306.83s -> 6307.87s]  the new one for PS4.
[6308.51s -> 6309.63s]  But I feel like this is the game...
[6309.63s -> 6310.03s]  Is that...
[6310.03s -> 6311.23s]  This happens in that game, right?
[6315.68s -> 6316.72s]  This is like the same game.
[6320.91s -> 6321.79s]  Something like that.
[6321.79s -> 6322.75s]  Yeah. Which way is it going?
[6323.39s -> 6333.87s]  I mean, is this...
[6333.87s -> 6335.39s]  Is it going that way?
[6336.19s -> 6337.23s]  Or to the left?
[6339.40s -> 6340.28s]  That I don't know.
[6340.92s -> 6346.09s]  The tracks.
[6346.09s -> 6347.21s]  I mean, those are tracks, right?
[6348.01s -> 6349.07s]  Or did I make those?
[6349.07s -> 6349.87s]  No, it's down here.
[6358.14s -> 6358.86s]  What's the button to call?
[6366.57s -> 6367.29s]  Fuck!
[6367.29s -> 6375.26s]  I don't even need to call them.
[6375.26s -> 6376.38s]  Why did I even call?
[6376.38s -> 6377.58s]  That was no reason for that.
[6381.87s -> 6383.31s]  I made these tracks.
[6391.55s -> 6392.43s]  Okay. There he is.
[6402.20s -> 6403.98s]  Got it.
[6403.98s -> 6405.02s]  Okay. We can stop this now.
[6405.58s -> 6406.08s]  Let's go!
[6416.41s -> 6417.13s]  Oh, it's actually...
[6417.13s -> 6418.17s]  Pick up the whole thing?
[6418.97s -> 6421.12s]  This is realism.
[6421.76s -> 6426.99s]  The compendium tracks what you have discovered in the world.
[6426.99s -> 6429.95s]  It can be accessed from the progress section of the pause menu.
[6429.95s -> 6435.58s]  We've found the realism.
[6436.14s -> 6441.24s]  And you can increase the distance that the horse will respond.
[6442.04s -> 6444.36s]  Come on!
[6448.86s -> 6449.58s]  There he is.
[6451.29s -> 6453.05s]  Shoot the deer in the head.
[6453.05s -> 6453.85s]  No!
[6453.85s -> 6455.77s]  I don't want to explode the deer's head.
[6457.21s -> 6472.19s]  All right. Let's go.
[6473.29s -> 6474.01s]  Yes, you do.
[6474.01s -> 6474.65s]  No, I don't.
[6475.29s -> 6476.73s]  I don't want to do it.
[6476.73s -> 6484.88s]  All right. Meet up with Charles.
[6487.12s -> 6488.24s]  All right, Charlie.
[6488.32s -> 6488.96s]  I'm coming.
[6499.85s -> 6501.21s]  I want to see its brains.
[6501.21s -> 6502.41s]  Jesus Christ!
[6509.80s -> 6513.34s]  So you drop off carcasses to Pearson
[6514.70s -> 6517.98s]  at the meat factory to contribute to gang supplies.
[6517.98s -> 6518.48s]  Okay.
[6522.06s -> 6523.34s]  Okay. You want to see the deer's balls?
[6523.34s -> 6524.46s]  Everyone's freaking out about it.
[6524.46s -> 6525.74s]  All right. Let's look at the deer's balls.
[6526.70s -> 6527.82s]  The deer doesn't have any balls.
[6529.50s -> 6530.00s]  Right.
[6530.22s -> 6530.72s]  Okay.
[6531.58s -> 6533.15s]  That's not how it works.
[6533.95s -> 6534.51s]  Seems to me.
[6541.40s -> 6542.12s]  You know, there are...
[6549.76s -> 6551.36s]  See? I told you they weren't going to be there.
[6560.67s -> 6561.71s]  I missed you guys.
[6561.71s -> 6562.35s]  I really did.
[6564.64s -> 6567.60s]  I unequivocally missed all of you.
[6574.84s -> 6578.83s]  We give the camp cook five minutes to grab the essentials and go.
[6579.47s -> 6582.75s]  And he doesn't even bring a crumb of food.
[6582.75s -> 6584.11s]  Good that we caught more than one.
[6584.75s -> 6586.35s]  We've only been up here a few days
[6586.35s -> 6588.43s]  and have already picked up two more mouths to feed.
[6589.15s -> 6590.43s]  One more.
[6590.43s -> 6592.35s]  I bet German doesn't even know me.
[6593.95s -> 6594.45s]  Boy!
[6595.55s -> 6596.05s]  What's your name?
[6606.65s -> 6607.21s]  Even me?
[6607.21s -> 6608.57s]  The one that makes fun of you?
[6608.57s -> 6609.07s]  Even you.
[6609.93s -> 6610.43s]  Even you.
[6624.16s -> 6626.24s]  No, I'm not going to show the horse balls.
[6628.32s -> 6629.28s]  That's too easy.
[6630.96s -> 6635.04s]  I'm not going to shoot the horse's balls with an arrow like everybody wants me to do.
[6635.04s -> 6639.04s]  That's not going to happen.
[6650.24s -> 6651.04s]  No one said that?
[6651.04s -> 6651.68s]  Yes, they did.
[6657.60s -> 6658.32s]  Oh, shit.
[6658.32s -> 6658.82s]  Bears.
[6667.15s -> 6667.87s]  No, don't shoot him.
[6670.27s -> 6670.99s]  Am I losing...
[6670.99s -> 6672.11s]  What's wrong with my arms?
[6672.11s -> 6672.67s]  No, let it go.
[6672.67s -> 6672.99s]  Let go.
[6672.99s -> 6673.31s]  Let go.
[6673.31s -> 6673.63s]  Let go.
[6673.63s -> 6674.03s]  There you go.
[6674.75s -> 6687.21s]  You're going awfully fast.
[6693.20s -> 6694.16s]  Oh, the horse is...
[6694.16s -> 6695.52s]  The horse is spooked.
[6695.52s -> 6696.02s]  Okay.
[6696.48s -> 6700.08s]  I'm going to hold L3 to make the horse not...
[6700.72s -> 6702.89s]  Can he see us?
[6705.24s -> 6706.04s]  Fight bear.
[6706.04s -> 6706.60s]  Fight bear.
[6707.48s -> 6714.16s]  Right in the fucking head.
[6715.12s -> 6721.87s]  All right, let's get out of here.
[6722.75s -> 6726.09s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6730.65s -> 6731.37s]  All right.
[6731.37s -> 6732.25s]  Cinematic mode.
[6737.80s -> 6738.84s]  He's screaming.
[6739.64s -> 6740.44s]  Where's my friend?
[6741.24s -> 6741.66s]  Come on.
[6741.66s -> 6741.98s]  Let's go.
[6741.98s -> 6742.38s]  Let's go.
[6742.38s -> 6743.34s]  Why is he standing there?
[6743.98s -> 6747.61s]  Is there a reason why he's just standing still up here?
[6755.29s -> 6755.93s]  The bear is gone.
[6756.49s -> 6757.48s]  Yeah, we're good.
[6762.57s -> 6763.45s]  I'm in combat.
[6763.45s -> 6764.17s]  No, I am not.
[6774.16s -> 6774.64s]  Let's go.
[6780.03s -> 6781.39s]  I have to fight the bear now.
[6781.95s -> 6795.96s]  Okay, I need to turn it off for a second.
[6795.96s -> 6796.44s]  Hold on.
[6796.44s -> 6797.00s]  Okay.
[6797.00s -> 6797.96s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[6797.96s -> 6798.68s]  Where's the bear?
[6806.60s -> 6808.27s]  Where's the bear?
[6808.27s -> 6809.15s]  I don't see a bear.
[6812.94s -> 6814.46s]  Give me the fucking carbine.
[6824.62s -> 6825.34s]  There's no bear.
[6826.44s -> 6827.16s]  He's not here.
[6827.80s -> 6832.76s]  Do you guys understand?
[6837.37s -> 6838.25s]  Do you see a bear?
[6848.96s -> 6849.76s]  I don't see a bear.
[6852.38s -> 6853.10s]  Wait, tracks.
[6856.01s -> 6856.65s]  Right there.
[6856.65s -> 6866.28s]  Where the fuck is he?
[6876.03s -> 6876.51s]  He's not here.
[6885.39s -> 6886.03s]  I see him.
[6888.32s -> 6888.88s]  No, you don't.
[6888.88s -> 6890.56s]  I mean, the red marker is over here.
[6894.28s -> 6895.64s]  Wouldn't he be over at the red marker?
[6896.36s -> 6899.88s]  I'm out of stamina.
[6899.88s -> 6900.36s]  I gotta eat.
[6900.36s -> 6901.16s]  Hold on.
[6901.16s -> 6903.52s]  Why did you guys make me do this?
[6904.24s -> 6906.30s]  I was so close to the end here.
[6910.65s -> 6911.85s]  Eat a can of beans.
[6911.85s -> 6920.78s]  Give me my horse.
[6923.05s -> 6924.81s]  You made you do this.
[6924.81s -> 6925.53s]  You did this.
[6926.65s -> 6929.82s]  There was never any bear?
[6932.92s -> 6933.80s]  Why do I hear it now?
[6934.44s -> 6940.54s]  Can we just leave?
[6941.34s -> 6942.22s]  We can leave.
[6942.22s -> 6942.62s]  Can't we?
[6943.42s -> 6945.90s]  He said, return to Charles.
[6945.90s -> 6946.46s]  He said, go.
[6946.46s -> 6947.34s]  Hurry up and return.
[6947.98s -> 6948.86s]  Where's my carcass?
[6949.82s -> 6953.05s]  Fucking carcass is on the ground over here.
[6953.05s -> 6953.93s]  That's what's happening.
[6953.93s -> 6954.33s]  I get it.
[6957.79s -> 6969.13s]  The horse is just as fucking stupid as I am.
[6972.22s -> 6972.54s]  All right.
[6972.54s -> 6973.90s]  This is why I couldn't move.
[6973.90s -> 6975.42s]  It has nothing to do with the bear.
[6980.86s -> 6981.18s]  See?
[6981.18s -> 6982.86s]  Everyone told me it's because I was in combat.
[6982.86s -> 6984.54s]  This isn't World of Warcraft.
[6985.58s -> 6986.38s]  We can just leave.
[6992.46s -> 6992.86s]  All right.
[6992.86s -> 6993.26s]  Let's go.
[6999.15s -> 6999.63s]  Fuck.
[6999.63s -> 7020.22s]  Who is this fucking bear?
[7021.10s -> 7029.96s]  I soft-locked the game?
[7029.96s -> 7030.68s]  No, I didn't.
[7030.68s -> 7031.56s]  Yeah.
[7031.56s -> 7058.83s]  We're fine.
[7058.83s -> 7060.19s]  Were you awake back there?
[7060.19s -> 7060.99s]  Yeah.
[7060.99s -> 7062.59s]  Just thinking.
[7063.63s -> 7066.35s]  We ain't ever talked that much, you mate.
[7066.35s -> 7067.71s]  Shoot bear with arrow.
[7068.67s -> 7070.43s]  And my toddler brain was like,
[7070.43s -> 7071.47s]  shoot bear with arrow.
[7071.47s -> 7072.35s]  OK.
[7072.35s -> 7073.47s]  I do think you say.
[7073.47s -> 7074.27s]  You think this?
[7074.27s -> 7074.91s]  What?
[7074.91s -> 7075.87s]  I'm a caveman.
[7076.99s -> 7079.45s]  Jerma, do that thing.
[7079.45s -> 7080.09s]  I do think.
[7080.73s -> 7083.53s]  Me shoot arrow to bow to bear head.
[7093.63s -> 7094.43s]  Me shoot bear.
[7096.17s -> 7097.29s]  Chat say good idea.
[7108.27s -> 7109.63s]  Me show balls.
[7115.84s -> 7116.40s]  Me laugh.
[7117.44s -> 7120.96s]  Me laugh at lowbrow joke.
[7146.24s -> 7149.20s]  Me stream on Twitch with bad internet.
[7153.76s -> 7160.19s]  Me try explain TCP IP to Bogo.
[7163.60s -> 7165.92s]  Bogo throw rock at head.
[7172.91s -> 7183.47s]  It's pretty nice and movie.
[7195.63s -> 7198.06s]  Well, it looks good.
[7199.58s -> 7202.14s]  But I'm streaming at 6,000 right now.
[7203.10s -> 7207.15s]  I mean, when it's good, it looks great.
[7207.95s -> 7208.43s]  Right?
[7208.99s -> 7210.11s]  When it's bad, yeah.
[7214.62s -> 7225.60s]  Who the hell is calling me right now?
[7227.76s -> 7230.12s]  But I cannot answer that.
[7254.20s -> 7255.32s]  So this upgrades.
[7255.88s -> 7258.12s]  Did they go a Fallout 4 route here?
[7259.08s -> 7261.32s]  Do I have to bring supplies and build stuff?
[7277.74s -> 7278.46s]  It's not forced?
[7278.46s -> 7278.86s]  That's good.
[7288.62s -> 7289.34s]  You earned it.
[7290.46s -> 7291.02s]  Have a drink.
[7291.02s -> 7291.74s]  It's urine.
[7291.74s -> 7293.42s]  Jesus, what is that?
[7293.42s -> 7294.70s]  Navy rum, sir.
[7294.70s -> 7295.74s]  It's the only thing.
[7295.74s -> 7296.46s]  The only thing.
[7297.82s -> 7298.62s]  Keeps you sane.
[7298.62s -> 7299.02s]  It does.
[7299.74s -> 7301.74s]  Seems to have done a treat on you.
[7301.74s -> 7303.42s]  You go rest that hand, Charles.
[7303.42s -> 7304.78s]  I'll be fine in a few days.
[7304.78s -> 7307.34s]  You mind helping me with the skinning, Mr. Morgan?
[7307.34s -> 7308.62s]  It's easier if we do it together.
[7308.62s -> 7309.66s]  I'll get to skin you.
[7310.94s -> 7313.08s]  You're always one with the jokes, aren't you?
[7313.08s -> 7313.64s]  Come on.
[7313.64s -> 7316.20s]  This really isn't a job for a man with a burnt hand.
[7316.20s -> 7317.72s]  I'll see you both later.
[7317.80s -> 7324.20s]  See, that guy has the quintessential haircut of end of the plate of spaghetti.
[7325.40s -> 7326.92s]  Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, you can take this.
[7326.92s -> 7327.56s]  I'm done.
[7327.56s -> 7328.52s]  Are you sure you're done with that?
[7328.52s -> 7329.00s]  Yep, yep.
[7329.72s -> 7337.55s]  Arthur, come on, get that knife.
[7337.55s -> 7342.11s]  Just get him.
[7342.11s -> 7343.15s]  Now shoot the deer.
[7343.15s -> 7345.31s]  No, I'm not going to fuck up the tutorial missions.
[7345.87s -> 7347.39s]  That was very quick.
[7348.84s -> 7350.04s]  That's what it looks like in there?
[7350.60s -> 7351.72s]  Not too bad, Mr. Morgan.
[7351.72s -> 7352.84s]  I thought it was wires and...
[7354.19s -> 7355.63s]  Yeah, we said you were a butcher.
[7356.67s -> 7357.87s]  Components and shit.
[7357.87s -> 7358.75s]  Looks like that in there.
[7364.43s -> 7366.19s]  I thought we just made animals.
[7366.19s -> 7367.15s]  They're like computers.
[7367.15s -> 7370.91s]  Well, if you catch anything else, sir, you bring it to me.
[7370.91s -> 7371.41s]  Sure.
[7372.43s -> 7373.79s]  Thank you, Mr. Morgan.
[7373.79s -> 7378.75s]  Heck, Arthur Morgan's first decent bit of hunting after all these years.
[7378.75s -> 7379.71s]  Yeah.
[7379.71s -> 7381.47s]  Well, we're on the run now.
[7381.47s -> 7383.63s]  Everyone's got to do their bit to survive.
[7383.63s -> 7384.75s]  You're not a Chuck E. Cheese.
[7385.39s -> 7386.19s]  The folk need it.
[7387.07s -> 7388.43s]  It's been a tough few days.
[7389.71s -> 7401.58s]  A few days later, you unlocked the Master Hunter Challenge.
[7402.68s -> 7404.12s]  All right, tutorial complete.
[7404.12s -> 7411.26s]  It's been a bad few weeks, but Dutch, being Dutch, he is busy making plans and
[7412.22s -> 7416.54s]  Dutch, being Dutch, those plans involve robbery and dreams.
[7419.23s -> 7419.87s]  Not yet, huh?
[7420.51s -> 7422.91s]  Who the hell is Epiticus?
[7422.91s -> 7425.15s]  I thought you was reading him his last rites.
[7425.55s -> 7429.07s]  Now I see you're introducing him to your other passion.
[7429.07s -> 7432.27s]  I'll mind you to show me some respect, Mr. Morgan.
[7432.27s -> 7433.63s]  Mind away, Reverend.
[7434.59s -> 7435.71s]  You're still here, then?
[7436.91s -> 7437.84s]  I owe you.
[7439.50s -> 7440.38s]  And you'll pay me.
[7441.47s -> 7442.91s]  For the moment, just rest.
[7444.41s -> 7447.58s]  Arthur, I think it's time for the train.
[7448.14s -> 7449.10s]  Want me to come?
[7449.10s -> 7452.06s]  Of course I do, but look out.
[7452.06s -> 7452.38s]  You stay.
[7452.38s -> 7454.06s]  That was always ugly, Dutch.
[7454.06s -> 7455.18s]  It's just a scratch.
[7455.18s -> 7456.62s]  Don't lie still, son.
[7457.26s -> 7458.06s]  What's that kid doing?
[7458.06s -> 7459.02s]  Get that kid out of here.
[7460.06s -> 7461.10s]  This is an M-rated game.
[7461.10s -> 7462.14s]  He's not allowed in here.
[7463.02s -> 7464.38s]  He's seen me now.
[7464.38s -> 7466.64s]  What's left of me?
[7466.64s -> 7469.15s]  What about you?
[7469.15s -> 7470.75s]  Guess I was hoping to see a corpse.
[7471.55s -> 7472.67s]  Bide your time.
[7472.67s -> 7473.95s]  You'll see plenty of them.
[7473.95s -> 7475.55s]  You're a rotten man, John Marston.
[7475.55s -> 7477.31s]  He is an idiot, Abigail.
[7477.31s -> 7478.19s]  We all know it.
[7478.19s -> 7479.07s]  Fix the D-sync.
[7479.07s -> 7481.47s]  Now, railway man.
[7481.47s -> 7482.03s]  Bill!
[7483.15s -> 7484.11s]  Tell me what happens here.
[7484.11s -> 7484.35s]  Ready?
[7484.35s -> 7486.67s]  At the water tower, just before the tunnel.
[7486.67s -> 7487.63s]  Ain't a problem.
[7487.79s -> 7489.39s]  Why are we doing this?
[7489.39s -> 7490.19s]  Weather's breaking.
[7490.19s -> 7490.75s]  We could leave.
[7490.75s -> 7492.43s]  I thought we was lying low.
[7493.71s -> 7495.39s]  What do you want from me, Jose?
[7495.39s -> 7497.79s]  I just don't want any more folks to die, Dutch.
[7497.79s -> 7498.91s]  We're living, Jose.
[7498.91s -> 7499.55s]  We're living.
[7499.55s -> 7500.51s]  Look at me.
[7500.51s -> 7501.23s]  We're living.
[7501.23s -> 7502.43s]  Even you.
[7502.43s -> 7504.11s]  But we need money.
[7504.11s -> 7506.03s]  Everything we have is in Blackwater.
[7506.03s -> 7506.43s]  Of course.
[7506.43s -> 7507.95s]  You fancy heading back there?
[7507.95s -> 7508.19s]  No.
[7509.31s -> 7511.74s]  Listen, Dutch, I ain't trying to undermine you.
[7511.74s -> 7516.94s]  I just want to stick to the plan, which was to lie low, then head back out west.
[7517.58s -> 7520.14s]  Now, suddenly, we're about to rob a train.
[7520.14s -> 7520.86s]  Now it's too fast.
[7520.86s -> 7522.22s]  What choice have we got?
[7522.86s -> 7524.14s]  The Viticus Cornwalls.
[7524.14s -> 7525.34s]  No joke, Dutchie.
[7525.34s -> 7527.34s]  Who is the Viticus Cornwall?
[7527.34s -> 7527.82s]  That fix it?
[7527.82s -> 7531.58s]  He's a big railway magnet, sugar dealer, oil man.
[7531.58s -> 7533.10s]  Well, how good for him.
[7533.10s -> 7535.74s]  Sounds like he has more than enough to share.
[7535.74s -> 7536.30s]  Dutch.
[7536.30s -> 7541.50s]  Gentlemen, it is time to make something of ourselves.
[7541.50s -> 7543.50s]  Get your horses ready.
[7543.50s -> 7544.86s]  We have a train to rob.
[7544.86s -> 7545.36s]  Better?
[7559.87s -> 7560.43s]  Bad.
[7560.43s -> 7560.93s]  Bad.
[7567.24s -> 7568.20s]  Everything's weird?
[7568.92s -> 7569.56s]  No, it's not.
[7570.60s -> 7576.67s]  We're riding with the gang.
[7577.23s -> 7577.79s]  All right.
[7577.79s -> 7578.59s]  Riding with the gang.
[7585.47s -> 7586.91s]  The street smells like pee now.
[7594.09s -> 7596.09s]  I'm gonna get hit by a train, I guarantee it.
[7598.92s -> 7600.68s]  Why is the audio playing backwards?
[7601.40s -> 7601.88s]  You know what?
[7602.68s -> 7603.40s]  You know what?
[7604.20s -> 7606.19s]  Don't you be coming back here now.
[7606.83s -> 7612.08s]  I don't know why that just popped in my head.
[7612.08s -> 7614.48s]  That's when you go to jail in the Monopoly game for Super Nintendo.
[7617.12s -> 7617.60s]  I don't know.
[7617.60s -> 7618.32s]  That just popped in.
[7618.96s -> 7620.00s]  It just popped in saying hello.
[7620.00s -> 7620.32s]  I don't know why.
[7628.80s -> 7629.74s]  It just popped in.
[7629.74s -> 7630.54s]  You know, it just popped in.
[7633.21s -> 7635.72s]  Game or reference.
[7638.04s -> 7639.08s]  I wasn't paying attention.
[7642.30s -> 7643.34s]  God damn it.
[7643.98s -> 7644.30s]  All right.
[7644.30s -> 7645.02s]  Rob the train.
[7645.02s -> 7645.82s]  That's all I need to know.
[7646.54s -> 7658.86s]  So what's the story about?
[7658.86s -> 7659.66s]  Group of bandits.
[7660.22s -> 7661.02s]  Setting up camp.
[7661.74s -> 7662.46s]  Getting deer.
[7664.59s -> 7668.86s]  And fending off other bandits.
[7669.58s -> 7670.14s]  So far.
[7670.86s -> 7672.38s]  And John Marston.
[7672.38s -> 7673.02s]  Oh, he did?
[7673.02s -> 7673.58s]  He didn't die?
[7674.30s -> 7675.23s]  What happened?
[7675.23s -> 7677.07s]  That's a close one.
[7685.00s -> 7685.80s]  Well, this is pretty.
[7690.17s -> 7691.37s]  No, did we go to like zero?
[7692.25s -> 7693.44s]  What's that right over here?
[7699.15s -> 7703.24s]  This is what I call a crew.
[7703.24s -> 7704.84s]  Charles Smith.
[7704.84s -> 7706.36s]  Bartholomew Morgan.
[7706.36s -> 7707.96s]  Javier Escuela.
[7707.96s -> 7711.95s]  First man.
[7711.95s -> 7715.15s]  I was under the assumption that I was hopefully going to be live for at least a couple of hours.
[7715.15s -> 7716.51s]  Let's hope it's stable.
[7716.51s -> 7718.51s]  You sure you're ready for this, kid?
[7718.51s -> 7719.39s]  Of course I'm ready.
[7720.19s -> 7721.71s]  Just stay calm.
[7721.71s -> 7722.99s]  Keep your eyes sharp.
[7722.99s -> 7723.39s]  Holy shit.
