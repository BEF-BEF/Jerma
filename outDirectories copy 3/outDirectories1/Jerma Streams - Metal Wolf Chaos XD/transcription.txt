[1.27s -> 4.79s]  Alright, now I'm gonna change the title. What's it? What should I change the title to? This is a From Software game, by the way.
[4.79s -> 9.82s]  Everyone that's gonna go, what? What? Wait, this is From Software? Yeah, From Software.
[10.54s -> 16.44s]  Here's how From Software was a part of this game. I think like two people walked into the office of the
[16.44s -> 22.42s]  people making this game, from From Software, and like drank out of the water cooler and looked at
[22.42s -> 26.87s]  what they were making and said, yeah, that looks alright. I don't think they had very much to do
[26.87s -> 39.11s]  with this. Maybe they did. Alright, Metal Wolf Chaos. I need a title though. Title, Metal Wolf Chaos.
[39.11s -> 54.65s]  From Software made this. Please click. Metal Wolf Boppin'. I like that. Metal Wolf Boppin' brackets.
[54.65s -> 59.53s]  From Software made this. Did you know that? Click my stream. Please watch the whole thing.
[59.53s -> 65.88s]  I like Metal Wolf Boppin'. Now this one, people said I was gonna really like this.
[76.60s -> 80.28s]  What do you think? Am I gonna like this? This is like a mech kind of jump around and
[80.28s -> 85.38s]  shooter game. This is gonna be loud. I gotta protect you guys ears for a second. Hold on.
[94.58s -> 103.53s]  I'm late to play this game. I'm late to play every game. The only games that I've ever played on
[103.53s -> 108.25s]  release have been the From Software games. Fuck, you're right. I should have played this like two
[108.25s -> 117.42s]  weeks ago. From Software presents. Hold on. Yeah, I play every From Software game at launch
[117.42s -> 125.90s]  and I didn't play this. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I can't see it. We can't see it. There
[125.90s -> 167.14s]  we go. What? Let's party. Let's party. Good sneaking job. Do I just pick it up right now?
[167.14s -> 186.55s]  Play now? I guess not. Yeah, I'm gonna turn this up a little.
[196.44s -> 200.92s]  I don't have any idea what's going on. I know that this is just constant conflict. That's it.
[200.92s -> 205.80s]  Do you really need to know anything else? Or just constant conflict. That's it. And just hold down
[205.80s -> 212.36s]  left mouse button.
[225.48s -> 233.80s]  All right. I'm the president?
[235.96s -> 246.94s]  Believe in your own justice. Metal Wolf Chaos by From Software.
[246.94s -> 254.71s]  Welcome. We got to work on this for a second though. Hold on. Graphics. Quality. Get that out
[254.71s -> 264.23s]  of here. Get that off. Quality high. Use those settings. Um, display. This is important because
[264.23s -> 268.87s]  this is full screen. It's not full screen. I'm already tough. We already got, I think this is
[268.87s -> 274.65s]  a 30 FPS game. Should I do controller? I think I'm gonna just, no, I'll do mouse. It's probably
[274.65s -> 291.11s]  easier to aim. Keybinding sound. Music volume. Nobody wants to listen to this. Voice volume.
[291.11s -> 302.73s]  Keep that up. You do. I didn't think you did. It was designed with the original Xbox in mind.
[302.73s -> 321.48s]  Bust that out. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm, yeah. I'm into it. Hold on. Dude. Hold on. Dude. No, I know.
[321.48s -> 328.25s]  I'm gonna stick with the mouse for now. If I hate it, I'll switch and you'll tell. You'll be able
[328.25s -> 332.17s]  to tell because I'll be like, this is stupid. That's not even fun. It's not even fun to control
[332.17s -> 337.21s]  this stupid game. That's like, it's just not even fun. Like when I do that, you know that's real.
[338.17s -> 348.31s]  Put voice on max. Sure. I want to take the volume of the music down. I don't like when music is
[348.31s -> 353.72s]  playing in my ears. I know some of you Sonic the Hedgehog fans are gonna be really mad about this.
[354.68s -> 362.65s]  All right. Let's take a look at the keybindings. I'm not, there's probably not gonna be much of
[362.65s -> 369.56s]  a tutorial. Jump boost. Yeah. Left shift. Change weapons. Middle mouse. Left mouse. Right mouse.
[370.20s -> 380.94s]  WSAD. Taunt is T. Burst attack. Um hmm. Burst attack. Stomp. We'll do, well I'll change that.
[380.94s -> 385.64s]  Burst attack with this. Stomp will be this mouse. All right. This seems easy enough.
[387.51s -> 396.49s]  Yeah. Let's go. I do have a gamer mouse. I have a Razor Deathadder because it's the only mouse
[396.49s -> 410.28s]  that is big enough to my big fucking wide palms. All right. Here we go. New game. Sellout. No,
[410.28s -> 413.72s]  no, no. I don't, I don't think anything else from Razor is worth buying. I think I've already
[413.72s -> 428.12s]  talked about this already. All right. Here we go. By the end of the first quarter of the 21st century.
[428.12s -> 433.16s]  I do that all the time. Of course the speedy boy says it. Freedom was dead in America beginning
[433.16s -> 437.88s]  with a large scale military coup d'etat that erupted in various cities throughout the nation.
[438.84s -> 445.82s]  The rebels seized power in all the central institutions of government. The entire nation
[445.82s -> 452.54s]  appeared to have fallen completely into the hands of the coup d'etat forces. However, one final hope
[452.54s -> 459.34s]  in opposing the coup d'etat forces remain. This final hope being the U.S. president himself.
[460.54s -> 466.54s]  Michael Wilson, the 47th president of the United States, equipped with a special mobile armored
[466.54s -> 473.18s]  op suit developed in secret by the military, boldly waged his own personal war alone
[474.50s -> 480.26s]  to take back America's freedom. I do appreciate the like 12k audio bit, right?
[483.56s -> 487.72s]  Get out my special op suit, Jody. That's back in the day when it used to be looks like CD
[487.72s -> 494.22s]  quality from the drop down in your windows menu. This kind of party is a first for me.
[495.18s -> 507.59s]  Mr. President, you're going to burst through the door.
[513.50s -> 519.34s]  All right. The people outside are really scary. Mr. President, Mr. President,
[519.34s -> 524.14s]  escape via the Eagle Star in the underground base. Now I'll open the entryway to the underground
[524.14s -> 529.27s]  base. Please give your guests some face time with her and she. How much damn, what's my health bar?
[529.27s -> 546.76s]  Oh, shit. All right. Where am I going? Do I have any other weapons or just that shotgun?
[547.64s -> 562.76s]  Oh, I know my right click. So is it auto aimed during the square? I think it is. It seems like
[562.76s -> 586.74s]  it. That square is huge. It is sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. President. Enter the underground
[586.74s -> 593.62s]  base using this oversized back door here. You got it. I'm on my way. I wish I could voice
[593.62s -> 597.94s]  this. You've got it, Judy. I'm making my way down through it.
[597.94s -> 603.69s]  The enemy are just lowly foot soldiers. Even at you in fire, they're no longer a special heavy
[603.69s -> 620.33s]  mobile armor. Anything you say, Judy. That'd be good. I'll be back. I'll be back. Better.
[625.26s -> 629.90s]  How long does that boost go? The Eagle Star is beyond here. Get going before the enemy chases
[629.90s -> 636.06s]  after you. Whoa, what the hell was that? While destroying anything that stands in your way.
[636.06s -> 640.38s]  Switching over your weapons, depending on the situation, is the main key to fighting.
[640.38s -> 643.50s]  Try out the weapons in your backpack as you like. How do I select them?
[644.86s -> 648.22s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Is there like a way to move up and down on them?
[648.94s -> 655.50s]  Current, current, current. Do I change them?
[661.26s -> 663.74s]  Scroll. Yeah, scroll on. I'm trying to scroll. It doesn't do anything.
[664.22s -> 680.28s]  You click. Middle mouse opens it and then scrolling doesn't do anything. I don't have
[680.28s -> 683.32s]  access to anything. Oh, there we go. There we go. You actually just have to... Okay, I get it.
[684.44s -> 686.04s]  You have to click left and right mouse.
[692.30s -> 705.16s]  All right, nice. I'm ready. I kind of want to speed up the turn.
[705.64s -> 709.96s]  There's an aircraft hangar beyond this passageway. Now, let's hurry. The aircraft
[709.96s -> 715.08s]  hangar is behind the barrier. I'll open the barrier now. Please wait a moment.
[715.08s -> 721.50s]  Let's just target the tiger. Just waiting for an air break.
[721.50s -> 726.22s]  Whoa, something quite dangerous awaits, but with missiles of that caliber,
[727.34s -> 731.18s]  if you aim and fire, you should be able to easily shoot them down.
[731.26s -> 739.83s]  Yeah, if you aim and fire. Oh, there's that FromSoftware dodge that I like.
[740.55s -> 755.85s]  That's it? Oh, I'm hitting the grail in front. Nice.
[758.86s -> 771.94s]  Enemy's behind. Where? Watch out! Rocket launcher kind of sucks.
[773.54s -> 774.74s]  If it hits the guardrail, it doesn't hurt.
[774.98s -> 775.48s]  Okay.
[787.96s -> 788.92s]  Guard, grail.
[802.90s -> 826.41s]  Air Force One, protected. I like it. What else we got? Up in the top?
[827.37s -> 841.93s]  Can I remove the HUD? You're not going to touch here. I'm going to get an S-ray for this one.
[842.81s -> 850.02s]  Anybody else? No. I'm good.
[865.50s -> 876.41s]  Oh, what? Oh, no, he got it off. That one guy saved whatever they're fighting.
[876.41s -> 878.52s]  I don't even know who's fighting. Who am I fighting?
[878.76s -> 881.08s]  Welcome to Air Force One.
[881.08s -> 884.52s]  What is this? Is this like, what invasion? I don't even know who I'm fighting.
[889.10s -> 890.78s]  Oh, that's right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[904.55s -> 905.27s]  What? Oh.
[906.07s -> 918.58s]  Like they were ever invited, they're definitely Michael.
[926.73s -> 935.58s]  Mr. President, it looks like this party is just getting started.
[936.54s -> 951.22s]  D. All right. E. C. Rush combo points. What's that mean?
[952.18s -> 959.51s]  Display KO point details. That's what I'm going to see.
[980.54s -> 984.14s]  Who believed in his own justice even when it seemed the whole country had turned against him.
[984.86s -> 986.54s]  DNN correspondent Peter McDonald.
[1004.09s -> 1005.69s]  I feel like this is part of that dream game.
[1012.89s -> 1044.18s]  I can't make it. I have to save America. We'll have to do dinner on Tuesday instead.
[1045.78s -> 1061.29s]  Mr. President, to my beloved fellow Americans. Good evening. This is an announcement from the
[1061.29s -> 1067.69s]  government policy promotion department, your American justice and freedom supporter.
[1068.89s -> 1072.97s]  First of all, what I would like to tell each and every one of you is this.
[1073.93s -> 1081.53s]  Recent events were not a mere coup d'etat, but rather a revolution to correct the wrongs
[1081.53s -> 1089.13s]  in the United States of America. To our regret, our nation is in a crisis situation.
[1090.09s -> 1094.97s]  Since 2010, domestic terrorism problems have increased rapidly.
[1095.61s -> 1100.01s]  Economic disputes originating from the exhaustion of fossil fuels
[1100.01s -> 1105.85s]  and the sudden rise in unemployment due to the influx of large scale immigration.
[1107.13s -> 1113.13s]  Neither the current president nor the American government took actions to address these various
[1113.13s -> 1120.17s]  problems. On the contrary, they have filled their own pockets adhering to terrorist cells.
[1121.45s -> 1129.69s]  To correct this situation, Richard Hawk, Arizona insurrection hero and vice president of the
[1129.69s -> 1139.45s]  old government and the U.S. military rose to the task at hand. Much like our ancestors did
[1139.45s -> 1146.33s]  based in a belief of winning freedom and based in the belief of an independent war
[1147.21s -> 1157.85s]  and based in the belief in this great nation. However, to our regret, an evil to disobey this
[1157.85s -> 1166.17s]  belief exists in the United States of America too. And here is that evil.
[1167.93s -> 1173.45s]  Currently donning this XB88 battlesuit. Who first appeared in Washington and began his
[1173.45s -> 1182.86s]  unjust rampage goes by the alias Metal Wolf. His current whereabouts are unknown.
[1183.74s -> 1190.38s]  While all of America will be under martial law until Metal Wolf is caught, please
[1190.38s -> 1198.30s]  do not confuse the issues at hand. Without fail, the U.S. military elite forces with a combined
[1198.30s -> 1208.94s]  strength of 1.5 million promise to smash this unforgivable evil to pieces. This has been an
[1208.94s -> 1216.06s]  announcement from the government policy promotion department. Your special remedy for all kinds of
[1216.06s -> 1230.33s]  evil. Evil. All right. White House. Reach Air Force One. We did it. Now we have San Francisco.
[1230.33s -> 1236.50s]  So we're getting getting attacked in San Francisco. All right. Economy. Technology.
[1236.50s -> 1245.80s]  Energy pod. What does this mean? All right. We go here. Should object to targets. Is this all
[1245.80s -> 1251.72s]  I can do now? Anything else? I guess we're going here. The Cudito Army that occupies
[1251.72s -> 1266.12s]  Francisco still runs rampages as the base of their military activities are built around the town.
[1266.12s -> 1273.82s]  Okay. Target areas where enemy forces are concentrated are dangerous, but you can weaken
[1273.82s -> 1289.18s]  their moration of San Francisco shine as a beacon of hope. I think they literally got this voice
[1289.42s -> 1294.74s]  to speak over the phone. What's the call name?
[1303.61s -> 1305.77s]  Okay. Got to have a drum roll.
[1308.01s -> 1310.71s]  Here we go. All right. Ooh, you actually get to make your own
[1312.23s -> 1316.55s]  loadout. That's cool. All right. Equipment. How much money do I have? Total money. 15,210.
[1317.51s -> 1323.38s]  All right. Develop. Fund and research. Fund research and develop new weaponry.
[1325.29s -> 1339.56s]  Investment. Fund weapon research. Manufacture. What is this? Single bazooka? Oh yeah, I think so.
[1340.52s -> 1351.03s]  Development level zero. Development costs 11,000. I have this. Oh, but what do I want the next one?
[1351.03s -> 1363.66s]  Okay. Missile launchers. Tracking capabilities. Grenade launchers, sniper cannons, rail guns,
[1363.66s -> 1373.74s]  multi-missile launchers, flamethrowers. I want a flamethrower. Yes. So this is now available
[1373.74s -> 1386.47s]  for development. Okay. So I can have an FLT 350. Nice. Okay. So now manufacturer. Flamethrower is
[1386.47s -> 1402.46s]  is shit. Rare metal required. How much do I have? Insufficient money. Damn it. Okay. It's all right.
[1403.26s -> 1411.69s]  I'll be able to do that next. All right. Equip. Shotgun. No, this is fine. This is like level two.
[1411.69s -> 1422.50s]  It's all right. Oh no. Mr. President, you left the office with a briefcase full of hundreds and
[1422.50s -> 1434.34s]  that's it. You only had 15 grand. What are you going to do now? Enemy list now. All right. Let's
[1434.34s -> 1473.80s]  go. Start. Meanwhile, in the skies above San Francisco. Mr. President, how's the sky?
[1476.28s -> 1484.94s]  Okay. Talk like you're in the wind. The correct direction there is there's a loud vacuum cleaner
[1484.94s -> 1489.50s]  and you're trying to have a conversation. The gentleman in me goes off the clock
[1489.50s -> 1505.38s]  at five p.m. Take America back. Here we go. Place the enemy army by destroying the target areas
[1505.38s -> 1510.34s]  where the troops have amassed. Destroy all the target areas. Give me. No. Give me. I want the
[1510.34s -> 1514.74s]  rocket launcher on this. I'm a sniper. All right. And then I want the rocket launcher here. Got it.
[1533.14s -> 1545.08s]  Or how about bazookas? All right. Give me. I want something better on here. Yeah. I want this.
[1545.80s -> 1549.72s]  And then give me this rocket. All right. We're going to stay with this thing. All right. Here we go.
[1553.00s -> 1564.90s]  What's this? Oh. Ammo. You need to string the chain to get it, right?
[1569.37s -> 1581.11s]  Hello? Oh. You have buildings. Okay. Anybody else? I think that's it. No? Dead.
[1589.50s -> 1598.84s]  Destroy the cage with light firearms and rescue the people inside. This is light, right?
[1603.06s -> 1615.14s]  Scientists. All right. So save the people in the cases and give it to the bad guys.
[1622.50s -> 1632.28s]  Let me get. Oh, I mean, they're on it. I want a copter.
[1632.28s -> 1667.16s]  Okay. I got to get a bazooka here. Hit. Hit. I'm definitely doing missiles. Missiles only.
[1673.54s -> 1682.63s]  I want to double. I want missiles on either hand. Heavy arms ammo. What's that? Shield unit.
[1683.59s -> 1695.96s]  Cool. Should I do double flamethrower? Just glide around to flamethrower? I think that sounds
[1695.96s -> 1712.79s]  like fun. No, don't. Okay. I blew it up. I didn't mean to. But it happened. No. Shit.
[1723.19s -> 1737.21s]  What's that? MP7. No, that's fine. Let's go this way. She told. I thought I told you.
[1738.09s -> 1750.28s]  Don't do that. All right. Let me try to get like a 20 or 30 chain here.
[1751.00s -> 1757.93s]  There's got to be more people on the screen if you get a better chain.
[1771.75s -> 1794.15s]  I missed Lou. I'll get it. I'll get it. Come on. Bonus rare metal. I should be blowing up all
[1794.15s -> 1808.57s]  this shit, right? What did I do? I missed something here. There. Shield unit.
[1814.31s -> 1830.28s]  You can break stuff by dashing through it. That's good to know. Thank you so much for telling me
[1830.28s -> 1870.38s]  that. Whoa. Are there bosses in this game? Yeah, there are. No, I know. I'll take care of it.
[1873.80s -> 1889.98s]  Can you shoot two things at the same time? Yes. Oh shit. I'm out of ammo. Uh oh. I'm at 49. That's
[1889.98s -> 1914.36s]  enough, right? I just hit the damn sign here. Don't ask chat. 99% have never seen the game before.
[1914.36s -> 1919.00s]  Yeah, but some people have. There's like one person here that's played this whole game
[1919.00s -> 1931.21s]  and has S ranking on every level. Oh shit. Where's my health bar? Is it the top right?
[1931.21s -> 1966.36s]  That like teal bar on the top right? No item? We failed. Left. Oh shit. You're right.
[1967.40s -> 1986.62s]  What does it say? Nice. M939. Nice. What does it say? Nice. What's the bopping for in the title?
[1987.94s -> 1995.80s]  Uh, I can't really explain it. The first hour of the stream will explain why the title is
[1995.80s -> 2009.30s]  metal. Metal gear bopping. Whatever this is. It's, you know, like roll my hand and
[2009.30s -> 2013.70s]  spin it around a few times and slap my wrist back and forth. Put my finger and my palm up
[2013.70s -> 2017.94s]  to my mouth. Lean forward and say you got to be there. You know that thing that I do?
[2036.52s -> 2045.51s]  What? How would I successfully explain what bopping is? I can't. How would I do that? It's
[2045.51s -> 2066.62s]  not possible. I want to use those. Bad. Look at all that. Look at all those yellow circles.
[2067.58s -> 2077.85s]  Come on. I got to keep it going. Chain. Chain. Chain. I'm going to get it.
[2084.33s -> 2088.01s]  Oh, but by the way, I didn't really talk about what's happening tomorrow.
[2089.26s -> 2106.78s]  Tomorrow? Wait. Target? What? Destroy all this stuff? Oh, that gets the building.
[2107.34s -> 2129.11s]  I'm getting like a real bad, like, lady is drunk vibe. Ooh, look at this. Take out the support beam.
[2130.63s -> 2133.70s]  I need more than just this rocket launcher if I'm going to do this.
[2134.74s -> 2146.09s]  Oh, anyways. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. So tomorrow, I have bought an Xbox 360 for one
[2146.09s -> 2152.41s]  reason. I bought the old, not the Kinect, the thing that came before the Kinect. It only was
[2152.41s -> 2159.53s]  available for like two games. It's the Xbox Live Vision Camera. And it's called You're in the Movies.
[2160.41s -> 2163.77s]  Not the U-Star one. This is before U-Star. This is the first one.
[2166.20s -> 2169.32s]  So it's going to be a fucked up screen tomorrow, I can guarantee you that.
[2170.12s -> 2179.88s]  Press F for you. Super. That's not, I pressed, you got me to press F. Is there a better way I can do
[2179.88s -> 2195.58s]  this? I feel like this is, oh no, I'm out of ammo. Missile alert. Oh, you weren't lying. Missile
[2195.58s -> 2206.81s]  alert. Missile alert. Where did it go? Oh, okay. Right, right, right, right. Okay, I get you.
[2213.19s -> 2218.65s]  Yeah, that's tomorrow. Tomorrow's, tomorrow's Terraria. No, Terraria is going to move to Sunday.
[2218.81s -> 2226.46s]  We're destroying the area. Tomorrow is Xbox 360. Green screen, fuck face stream.
[2227.10s -> 2248.68s]  All right, here we go. I don't, what about ammo? Drunk. I can't hurt this. I need something better
[2248.68s -> 2260.14s]  than that. What's going on? Am I sniping? Why am I standing still? Stop, stop. I don't want to stand
[2260.14s -> 2286.46s]  still. How do I get out? I don't want to be sniping. Mr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President.
[2286.46s -> 2296.14s]  Snake, yeah. Oh no, I don't want to do this again. Fuck. Oh my God. What the hell. All right, I,
[2297.02s -> 2303.85s]  no, I don't know. I don't know, I had the sniper out before and it didn't zoom in. I couldn't get it
[2303.85s -> 2322.86s]  off. I tried to take off the sniper and it wouldn't do anything. He didn't light the bonfire. No,
[2322.86s -> 2335.45s]  it didn't. All right, let's just go. I don't, I don't need to destroy these.
[2338.31s -> 2348.34s]  I know where I'm going. This is a bootleg armored core. Here's the funny thing about that. Made,
[2348.34s -> 2359.40s]  this is the same com- Prime software actually made this. Don't walk into the front of me.
[2360.36s -> 2370.71s]  I want to get a better weapon though. This is, the shotgun's fine on here, but I need the, yeah,
[2370.71s -> 2398.38s]  the ammo. No, and I didn't. I know what they are. I don't want to use that much of this though,
[2398.38s -> 2407.78s]  because I need it later for that tank. Mr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President.
[2407.78s -> 2415.72s]  Mr. President. Happy, sad, excited. Say it all different ways.
[2417.08s -> 2421.72s]  Give me your best. I'm sad, Mr. President. Now give me your best. I'm happy, Mr. President.
[2440.42s -> 2449.98s]  I'm on it. Michigan report from hell. That game was insane.
[2462.17s -> 2468.15s]  Michigan report from hell was, because I had to play that on like a weird emulator because it
[2468.15s -> 2472.63s]  wasn't localized. That was a Japanese game, right? I don't think that even released in the United
[2472.63s -> 2490.49s]  States. We're going quicker this time. EU. Yeah, but that's a PAL console. I didn't have a PAL
[2490.49s -> 2515.00s]  console. Make sure to use your rush from the circle was flashing. I'll give it a try.
[2515.00s -> 2537.06s]  Why? Wait, let me save these people. No items dropped. Got it. That is actually really,
[2537.06s -> 2545.21s]  really effective. Somebody said I can't tell the scale of anything in this game.
[2548.68s -> 2565.70s]  It's just a lot of running, shooting, sprinting, dashing. How big am I? Am I just a guy in kind
[2565.70s -> 2568.34s]  of fallout armor? I'm not supposed to be like a hundred feet tall, right?
[2578.47s -> 2586.02s]  What? Which one is it? You're supposed to be five, seven. Nice. That's pretty big.
[2597.26s -> 2604.95s]  Shut up. Shut up. I think you're a five, seven in this game.
[2605.67s -> 2614.52s]  I don't know. Let's look at the official documentation of the game manual.
[2621.64s -> 2648.76s]  Imagine being short and actually being a dick. I got you. No bullets. All right. No, no, no,
[2648.76s -> 2654.70s]  I don't want to waste these. Here we go. Nope. After this, it comes a tank and then I'll take
[2654.70s -> 2678.30s]  care of it. I got the... No, this is an epic building. The boomer is fuming. It's bad after
[2678.30s -> 2682.22s]  all those boomer comics because I know what it's like to fucking roll out of bed with my back hurt
[2682.22s -> 2687.98s]  because I slept on it wrong for like an hour. You'll know. You'll see. You'll see.
[2692.26s -> 2714.14s]  Ah, that's it, right? Is there more down here? Defensive argument? No, augment. Defensive
[2714.14s -> 2723.42s]  streamer. Something like that. Something like that. Light-armed ammo. Okay, is there anymore?
[2723.42s -> 2743.99s]  Did I miss ammo back here? Whatever. There was something back here. No, there wasn't. I'm
[2743.99s -> 2757.02s]  getting jibbed. Don't ban us. Why would I ban you? What have I happened to scare Saturdays? Scare
[2757.02s -> 2788.07s]  Saturday. Let's go. Let's get in close. Go! Come on. Bring it down. This is fucking weird.
[2788.63s -> 2794.81s]  What do you mean it's weird? What's wrong? What's the difference? This is a mech game.
[2795.53s -> 2814.25s]  What do you mean it's weird? This game is weird. Bring it down. Come on. I mean, I guess it is weird.
[2814.25s -> 2828.57s]  You're right. All right, now this is where I gotta be careful because I'm not gonna screw this up
[2828.57s -> 2850.01s]  again. Get rid of the tank. Here it comes. Here we go. Gotta watch that explosion. I feel like
[2850.01s -> 2859.30s]  she's talking to me like I'm sick. Make junk food out of him. Turn him into, turn him into,
[2859.30s -> 2864.52s]  turn him into a chicken nugget. Is he gonna? Bam. No, I'm not.
[2872.10s -> 2885.21s]  What? Is he vulnerable somewhere? This game's really weird. This game's not that weird.
[2885.21s -> 2892.01s]  What is so weird about this game? Stop it. Oh, it's a weird game, huh?
[2895.64s -> 2908.25s]  Why? It's like a mech shooter. Why is it so weird? This game's weird. What a fucking weird game.
[2910.39s -> 2941.22s]  Okay, I don't want to lose again. So, okay, I'm good. Are they even reaching? Shoot it in the gun.
[2941.22s -> 2953.24s]  Right in the gun. Yeah, I gotta hit it right in the gun. Ah! I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2953.24s -> 2958.52s]  I'm not dead. Am I? Oh my god. Why? What happened? What? Why did I just lose instantly? What
[2959.48s -> 2970.78s]  happened? What happened? I don't understand. Is it missiles? I have to do this whole thing again.
[2988.81s -> 3005.53s]  What a weird game. Play the Shire thing. I gotta pee. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I need to upgrade.
[3005.53s -> 3009.94s]  Fuck. I shouldn't have bought the flamethrower. This is a mistake. I gotta upgrade. You're not
[3009.94s -> 3013.94s]  supposed to win there. You're supposed to listen to the From Software game. I just walked up to
[3013.94s -> 3018.34s]  like the third boss. I had to get souls and upgrade my guy. I have to upgrade my, go to
[3018.34s -> 3021.78s]  my garage and upgrade my character. That's just what it is. All right, I'm gonna pee. I'll be right
[3021.78s -> 3198.17s]  back. Dude, did I seriously pick the flamethrower, which is expensive and I screwed everything up?
[3200.97s -> 3204.65s]  I played a From Software game and I put like six points into faith
[3205.96s -> 3209.85s]  in the very beginning of the game. What the hell did I do that for?
[3212.57s -> 3228.66s]  All right. Let's get this fresh beer open. Ooh. All right. Develop. Can I do anything else?
[3230.60s -> 3237.16s]  Manufacture. Like a new shield. I should have, I should have manufactured one of these.
[3245.00s -> 3249.16s]  Missile launchers, grenade launchers, sniper guns, rail guns. I need to just do explosives.
[3250.04s -> 3254.73s]  Like grenade launcher or something. Damn it. Why did I pick flamethrower? Why'd you guys let me do
[3254.73s -> 3267.66s]  this? Just redo the first level? I can do that. Oh, I can do that. I can do that. You're right.
[3268.54s -> 3276.49s]  I can do that. Oh my God. You're right. I can do this. Yeah. All right. From Software. Let's go.
[3286.34s -> 3304.28s]  Get out my special ops suit, Jody. All right. Yeah, I'm ready. Give me like a 30 chain.
[3306.97s -> 3312.70s]  100 chain. Get some money and then I'm going to upgrade my missile launchers.
[3318.82s -> 3325.72s]  Already grinding on the first level. Kind of, but not really. I would call this a mini grind.
[3325.72s -> 3330.68s]  This is not a real grind. Oh, by the way, I didn't talk about this too. At some point after the
[3330.68s -> 3337.34s]  carnival stream. I'm not going to do it yet, but it's going to happen at some point in September.
[3338.58s -> 3344.74s]  Uh, I'm going to be pulling the streams back. Start time by about an hour.
[3345.86s -> 3351.59s]  I'm going to be starting my screens somewhere around this time.
[3356.18s -> 3360.36s]  Like between like, well, not now. I mean like, you know, a couple hours ago.
[3361.32s -> 3371.34s]  And the reason for that is because my streams have been going much more than like four hours
[3371.34s -> 3375.74s]  like they ever used to. Before I moved to Vegas, my streams were like four to five hours long.
[3376.78s -> 3382.70s]  They're starting to become six, seven, eight hours long, more than half the time, I'd say.
[3383.74s -> 3386.94s]  And what ends up happening is if I start my stream at three or four o'clock in the afternoon,
[3388.30s -> 3394.46s]  after that, like six, seven, eight hour period, it starts to become like two, three, four, five
[3394.46s -> 3406.90s]  o'clock in the morning Eastern. And who God knows how long. So I've decided that I don't
[3406.90s -> 3418.54s]  want to have my streams because they've been going late. They have them. That's kind of the theory
[3419.18s -> 3424.44s]  because it used to be, you know, I'd started like seven o'clock Eastern and my streams would end at
[3424.44s -> 3435.05s]  like 11 or 12 Eastern. They didn't go for that long. I have, holy shit. I'm going to get like
[3435.05s -> 3441.75s]  a good lot of points for this. I forgot to move. I need 250. All right. I'm good. Let's go.
[3445.51s -> 3460.60s]  That was one of the things I want to talk about though. Keep the train going at 265.
[3470.44s -> 3473.64s]  This mission is so short, so it'll be fine.
[3478.66s -> 3485.30s]  I also have this thing. I'm going to use it, but I think it's better for everybody.
[3486.10s -> 3493.70s]  Beyond this passageway. Now let's hurry being on Pacific time is as far back as I could possibly
[3493.70s -> 3526.73s]  be. Come on. Come on. Did I go too fast? I guess I could be in Hawaii and I can notice when, you
[3526.73s -> 3533.74s]  know, when people started to get tired and it's to be one, two, three, every stream in the last
[3533.74s -> 3539.58s]  few months for pretty much, I think like 80% of every stream has gone to like at least two or
[3539.58s -> 3550.34s]  three a.m. Eastern. I never used to do that before I moved here. I would much rather have
[3550.34s -> 3571.11s]  the streams end around 11, 12 Eastern than be still chugging along. I'm going to get money for
[3571.11s -> 3580.86s]  this. Put it into my missile launches from September. Yeah. I want enough time for people
[3580.86s -> 3584.54s]  to know that that's going to happen. I don't want to just start like today is kind of just
[3585.18s -> 3590.33s]  I'm just seeing how I like it. I would have started at like three or four, but I'm just
[3590.33s -> 3595.29s]  trying to see how much I like doing this. I'm going to do it a few times, but officially I'm
[3595.29s -> 3601.02s]  not going to say that yet. Probably after the carnival stream is when it'll be officially my
[3601.02s -> 3608.92s]  stream will be pulled back like two hours because it's easy for me to be like, yeah, as of today,
[3608.92s -> 3618.39s]  I streams are not going to start at 12, but that's not a reality. All right. How much money do I get?
[3619.03s -> 3632.23s]  Two air force one. So stream length will be the same. Just where it will be there,
[3632.23s -> 3643.18s]  what period will be an S rank. That's an A rush. What is this rush combo? That's really bringing
[3643.18s -> 3655.62s]  me down. That's fucking up my whole GPA. Well, that's how you get that's $69,000. That's so
[3655.62s -> 3661.34s]  I'm I did it correct this time. You have to be dashing. All right, let's go to the garage.
[3661.82s -> 3676.78s]  The coup d'etat. I'm ready. Develop. Here we go. Manufacture. Let's get that flame throw.
[3677.82s -> 3695.54s]  All right, let's get it. Develop this weapon. Yeah, I have one of them now. All right. Investment
[3696.34s -> 3701.62s]  handguns. Where are we going? We want multi-missile launchers, rail guns, sniper cannons,
[3701.62s -> 3712.47s]  grenade missile launchers. Develop. The ML-60ST is now available for development. Do it again.
[3712.47s -> 3721.78s]  How much is that? Do it again. Oh, the gold VE is now available. All right, I got 30 grand.
[3721.78s -> 3731.02s]  Let's try. Let's get some of these. ML. The ML-6ST ham. Let's go to the manufacturer.
[3731.74s -> 3740.07s]  Let's see. Firepower 1160. No, no, no, no, no. I want to look at it. Basic missile launcher
[3740.07s -> 3746.07s]  offers a balanced set of capabilities. Fires missiles vertically. Specialized tracking capability.
[3746.87s -> 3760.55s]  Lock-on speed F. Guidance system S. Range S. 1060. This one's just better. I'll get it. I'll try it.
[3761.11s -> 3772.38s]  I want this one too, though. Grenade launchers that don't have any. I definitely want more of
[3772.38s -> 3784.20s]  these. Where are they? I want two of these. What? I need active research in here to be able to do
[3784.20s -> 3793.69s]  this. Machine guns. How much is it? Let me go investment. 10,000. Let's just see. Let's get
[3793.69s -> 3801.35s]  something. MP7 is now available. I can't make it, though. All right. That should be all right,
[3801.35s -> 3819.27s]  though. Let's go to equip. The handgun is all right, but flamethrower. No, I can, I can,
[3819.27s -> 3825.37s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I can have another weapon here. Okay. That's cool. Where's my
[3825.37s -> 3837.62s]  flamethrower? Get that on there. Oh, it has to be both hands. That's annoying. Well, the sniper
[3837.62s -> 3846.65s]  rifle is stupid. It's not good. I don't want it. Let's do, uh, this one and then the ham.
[3847.45s -> 3858.30s]  Okay. Shotgun pistol. That's easy. These two are fine. And then I definitely want to be able to
[3858.30s -> 3863.99s]  have at least, yeah, these two. That's good. All right. Let's see if I can do any better this time
[3863.99s -> 3887.91s]  and not lose at the last boss instantly. Save it. Go. No, I'm messing around. I want to test
[3887.91s -> 3905.74s]  them out, though. Here's this. Here's this. Let's set the flamethrower first. Am I, where, am I
[3905.74s -> 3924.70s]  reloading it? Is it using the boost, too? That's not good. It uses the boost, so I can't speed
[3924.70s -> 3947.51s]  down the road and do it. Use the boost to get through it. I'll try. Move out of the way.
[3949.99s -> 3956.62s]  Let's do, let's do shotgun for this. Right in the beginning here, it's really not a big deal. I
[3956.62s -> 3964.94s]  can just get through this. Once the towers become a thing. That's when I move on to the rocket
[3964.94s -> 3989.11s]  monsters. I also want to talk about the highlights activity book stream. I had the, I brought the
[3989.11s -> 3994.07s]  mods together and we talked about it for a while. And it should be interesting. Don't, I'm not ready
[3994.07s -> 3998.47s]  to give any dates or anything right this second. I want to, but by the end of this weekend, you'll
[3998.55s -> 4003.99s]  have a real kind of plan and date on how that's going to play out. All right, let's give me the
[4003.99s -> 4014.36s]  hand and test the hand. This is so much better. Having two missile launchers is a thousand times
[4014.36s -> 4028.90s]  easier to take these things out. Weird, this is a weird stream.
[4028.90s -> 4050.74s]  I think this changes everything. How many bullets do I have? I have 50. That's all right.
[4053.03s -> 4059.27s]  There's also a stomp. That's right. There is a stomp. Oh shit, I totally forgot about that.
[4074.07s -> 4081.22s]  This stream is quirky. Would you get, you wouldn't classify me as a quirky streamer, right?
[4081.54s -> 4105.38s]  What did you guys say? A musician? What does that mean? You get what you think I'm a quirky
[4105.38s -> 4112.55s]  streamer? I don't think so. I think I'm more of an intelligent streamer. Like when you, when you
[4112.55s -> 4119.26s]  turn the stream on, you know that you're going to get some really, really just smart things.
[4120.38s -> 4122.70s]  Intelligent, smart, like discussion.
[4122.70s -> 4146.90s]  As I don't know now where to go. I was too good. I cleared it too quickly. It's down here right
[4146.90s -> 4158.63s]  here. He says that as he plays the video game equipment, smashing toys together and making
[4158.63s -> 4179.78s]  explosions sound. That's the metal gear solid. Travel through time cigar lady sound. Slow that
[4179.78s -> 4197.24s]  down. Stretch out the tempo a little. You got it. You got it. It's there. You know, I didn't, I
[4197.24s -> 4201.48s]  wasn't sure about this game at first, but now that we've played it for about an hour or so,
[4201.48s -> 4205.48s]  half hour, I'm, I could see how I'm, I could play this for a little bit. I could see this.
[4206.44s -> 4221.70s]  Let's try to get through the second level. That'd be great. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4222.34s -> 4233.78s]  This will explode, right? I, I, I was standing right there and I did it. I mean it failed. You
[4233.78s -> 4252.82s]  just saw me do it too slow. I was not too slow. That was perfect. No, I'm not going to do it.
[4254.02s -> 4259.14s]  I was going to just say something just to say it, just to say words, but I'm not going to do it
[4259.14s -> 4266.12s]  because it's like, it's like one of those video meme things that have just been like a thousand
[4266.12s -> 4273.61s]  of them. I will tell you the thing that I was going to say, just, just to like say is on the
[4273.61s -> 4281.58s]  screen right now. Like the word is on the screen and it's a meme that's been just done a million
[4282.94s -> 4301.05s]  I'll give you another hint. The thing that this originates from, uh, the original source material
[4301.05s -> 4307.05s]  will probably be around in two to three hundred years. It'll be on season like 300.
[4348.23s -> 4362.49s]  Judy, stop. I need ammo. Otherwise this is not happening. How much ammo is in the other ham?
[4363.21s -> 4376.46s]  Or it almost sounds like her lines have been pitch shifted a little bit and slowed the tempo
[4376.46s -> 4381.66s]  has been changed, not pitch shifted. You know, when you listen to a audio recording that just
[4381.66s -> 4389.48s]  sounds off, even if it's pitched a tempo change by about 10%, a normal speaking voice just sounds
[4389.48s -> 4392.92s]  normal because you hear me talking and you, you, your brain connects all the dots in between.
[4393.48s -> 4400.76s]  Yeah, I have an accent, whatever. Right. But the second that you slowed down speech, it sounds
[4400.84s -> 4406.39s]  really strange. You can hear every single mistake. Why is this not falling?
[4408.47s -> 4414.66s]  So me going like this, hey, what's going on, everybody? Slow down tempo speed is like,
[4414.66s -> 4419.78s]  hey, what's going on, everybody? And it's just like, oh, you sound like shit. Is that actually
[4419.78s -> 4433.90s]  how ugly your voice is? It's like, yeah, it is. He's drunk. Oh, fuck. I have to pay attention.
[4433.90s -> 4463.13s]  Nobody talk. You see, can I not shoot? What is going on? What the fuck is happening? Oh,
[4463.13s -> 4487.67s]  I didn't close it. Get this off too. What am I doing with this? Well, I only have three shots in
[4487.67s -> 4503.32s]  this. Dude, something's fucking hitting me and it's bad, really fucking bad. And it's almost
[4503.32s -> 4528.54s]  killing me every time. Is it the missiles? Is he pretending? I'm not pretending.
[4529.42s -> 4534.71s]  What would I be pretending? I've done this. This is the third time I've done this. I think I'm
[4534.71s -> 4544.92s]  going to fucking pretend to like get hurt by this. This would be such a dog shit stream if I had to
[4544.92s -> 4552.87s]  do this a third fucking time. Do you understand? Why would I want to do this a third time?
[4555.37s -> 4562.62s]  Do I want to make your viewing experience horrible? I've got like a fun idea. Let me do
[4562.62s -> 4569.22s]  the fucking like second tutorial mission six times. Maybe everyone will leave.
[4582.78s -> 4593.42s]  Dude, okay. Did you see what happened? What the fuck, man? What? You gotta be kidding me.
[4595.98s -> 4609.13s]  This thing does so much damage. I'm getting hit by these like stray rockets that come in and just
[4609.13s -> 4624.79s]  kill you. They do almost the entire life bar. This is the Tails mission. What is that? I don't
[4624.79s -> 4654.98s]  know what that even means. Oh my god. Oh my god. This is unbelievable. Like what the fuck is this
[4654.98s -> 4690.07s]  game? What? What? That was like stupid. Why is this game like this? I'm just, I'm just,
[4690.07s -> 4709.06s]  I don't even care about points. I'm getting... Oh, shut up, Judy. What the hell was that? That
[4709.06s -> 4731.72s]  didn't make any sense. I'm like actually upset with this game. I'm going. Just go. Just go. Go.
[4732.76s -> 4742.92s]  Each area. Destroy each target and blow the air that's come from the adjacent areas.
[4742.92s -> 4748.78s]  When there are too many reinforcements... Shoot the missiles? I was shooting the missiles. I was
[4748.78s -> 4753.18s]  targeting with my, that's why I had the assault rifle out the whole time. If one of them touches
[4753.18s -> 4779.00s]  you, it takes like 60% of your health. ...facility. When communications are made, largest, so destroy it.
[4779.00s -> 4795.27s]  The dying joke. Yeah, why would I ever do this three times? Shoot the missiles. I'm shooting the
[4795.27s -> 4806.79s]  missiles. I was dodging them and shooting them. You just rewind and watch. I was shooting the
[4806.79s -> 4814.34s]  missiles. I just watched the last encounter. I wasn't just letting them hit me going. What is
[4814.34s -> 4820.34s]  that? What is that thing flying at me from across the screen? What are those? Those aren't missiles,
[4820.34s -> 4826.50s]  are they? No, no, they're, what are they? I think they're bugs. I'm getting hit in the face. What's
[4826.50s -> 4834.71s]  hitting me here? Should I shoot those fucking things? Nah, nah, I'm just gonna let them hit me.
[4863.06s -> 4869.85s]  Now, I'm saving my missiles. I want, I'm saving my hand missiles.
[4871.14s -> 4907.16s]  If I don't do this right now, I'm gonna refund the game. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.
[4907.96s -> 4934.97s]  Do I get extra health? Why am I taking so long? Tank. I hate that fucking tank. I hate it.
[4949.77s -> 4969.38s]  I'm just going. I don't even care. How many times does he stop, how many times does it take for him
[4969.38s -> 4974.74s]  to stop pretending and play at the normal? Well, usually what happens is, I don't know, after about
[4974.74s -> 4978.98s]  the fourth or fifth time of like LOL, he's patting his screen and he can't beat it.
[4979.70s -> 4984.34s]  Like we'd laugh about it and I'm like, what? I can't do it. What happened? I can't beat the
[4984.34s -> 4993.24s]  level. And then everyone like laughs. I've had like six or seven times. I turn the face,
[4993.24s -> 5001.08s]  came on and I go like, what? I died to the tank. And everyone like laughs like LOL,
[5001.08s -> 5007.19s]  you died to the tank. He's like, he can't beat it. And I get like a fucking clown whistle and I go
[5007.19s -> 5014.41s]  like. I looked right into the fucking lens. I go like this. I just go. Nevermind. I can't even
[5014.41s -> 5026.46s]  turn the camera on. Yeah, I die. I die. And then I go like this. You know what I mean? Like,
[5027.80s -> 5051.37s]  what is that? It's my ceiling. Where is this camera? Why is it over here? You get it. You
[5051.37s -> 5059.00s]  get the idea. I go like this. Oh, that's why. That's why it's fucked up. There's a big explosion
[5059.00s -> 5062.68s]  and it fucking takes, like takes me out. Like, oh no, I can't believe. I'll show you. I'll give
[5062.68s -> 5066.52s]  a couple of examples. We'll keep the face cam on for just a minute or two. Just so you understand.
[5071.29s -> 5078.84s]  Right. So I am going to keep the face cam on for this. Because that means I have to like, I can't,
[5078.84s -> 5093.19s]  I can't like do any dumb like facial features or anything. What on the bug cam? If I lose this
[5093.19s -> 5109.69s]  fucking thing again, I swear to God. I'm gonna be spreading like lips on chat. Am I out of ammo for
[5109.69s -> 5117.93s]  this? Oh, just. I'm not doing this again. I swear to God. I promise. This game's fun. I'm gonna get
[5117.93s -> 5145.90s]  my acting on my flies down. Oh shit. Let me fix that. What are you doing? Oh, I almost died.
[5145.90s -> 5149.26s]  Okay. I'm going to do it. People are going to come into the stream. They can fucking hate this
[5149.26s -> 5158.87s]  stream, but I'm going to do a stream. Here comes the video. Yeah. People are going to hate this,
[5158.87s -> 5165.14s]  but I'm flustered right now. So we're going to do it. Here you go. You ready for this?
[5166.10s -> 5179.32s]  I can't do this. I'm going to try. No, I'm not even like, I'm not happy enough to do this.
[5184.04s -> 5187.62s]  Let me get rid of this for I'm going to make this quick. And then here comes the tank and I'm going
[5187.62s -> 5200.44s]  to get it right. Turning the face cam on means I have to like behave. All right. Here we go.
[5201.72s -> 5213.26s]  I am ready. I've got my two launchers. I shouldn't even use this here. I should use it on the actual
[5213.42s -> 5220.39s]  tank. That's the problem. Okay. So I don't, I know I can't double it up because they have to shoot
[5220.39s -> 5226.31s]  the missiles, right? Like I shouldn't do this because then I have to shoot the missiles out
[5226.31s -> 5237.16s]  of the air. I don't have anything to shoot the missiles out of the air. I just have to get,
[5237.16s -> 5240.92s]  I had to just do good. I just have to dodge the missiles. I can't even do this. It's impossible.
[5241.80s -> 5250.70s]  It's not possible to do this right now. Use your shotgun.
[5250.70s -> 5289.00s]  Oh, where are they? Here it comes.
[5305.90s -> 5313.37s]  I just shut my nose. My nose just closed shut.
[5336.94s -> 5341.26s]  You can't tell me that I'm doing, you can't tell me that that's okay. Don't even tell me that's
[5341.26s -> 5401.53s]  okay. I died. I died. It killed it. It killed me so fast that it gave me 50% of my health back.
[5401.53s -> 5404.09s]  I don't have anything else to shoot them out of the air with.
[5421.80s -> 5443.32s]  It's killing me and bringing me back to health. This is, it's toned up too high. The game is
[5443.32s -> 5451.03s]  broken. It's a broken game. It's killing me so fast with these missiles that it's actually
[5451.03s -> 5458.33s]  fucking resetting my health. There's a wrong number here. Toned incorrectly. It has to be.
[5463.59s -> 5477.21s]  I need ammo for my assault rifle. Offensive argument. Come on, give me something
[5478.46s -> 5484.06s]  that's not, I need ammo in this gun. Ammo, light arms ammo. Got it. All right. Good.
[5487.29s -> 5491.93s]  Good. Good. Good. Shield unit. Got it. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Fuck off.
[5492.57s -> 5502.36s]  No, not you guys. Where's my, there it is. And then I need this missile alert, missile alert,
[5502.36s -> 5569.59s]  alert missiles, missiles alert coming in. Where? Missile alert coming in. Missile alert. No bullets.
[5607.80s -> 5614.76s]  Dude, you can't beat the game. You just don't, the game doesn't, you can't win. I'm convinced.
[5661.26s -> 5669.86s]  Nice haircut. See how fucking big my hands are. This is a full size.
[5670.74s -> 5684.86s]  In San Francisco have, Mr. President. Sure. All in a day's work. All in a day's work.
[5684.86s -> 5696.89s]  It just begun. Fight will continue. Oh, Eagle. The America inside my heart is still alive.
[5696.89s -> 5713.00s]  Okay. Camera, I can turn this off now. I don't need it anymore. That's a hundred. I don't care.
[5713.00s -> 5724.22s]  I don't care. That tank was dumb. New weapon. MP7N. Saving the citizens increases your economy
[5724.22s -> 5728.06s]  rating in San Francisco. Survive saying the scientists increase your technology rating
[5728.06s -> 5737.35s]  in San Francisco. Seven. Okay. I've got some money. What is this? What is this?
[5747.37s -> 5762.89s]  That doesn't even look like me. I mean, it does, I guess. Look at that huge chin.
[5768.20s -> 5770.52s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta get this on here.
[5779.78s -> 5795.83s]  Uh, it looks like, it looks like something dragged this chin. Did you drag this down?
[5795.83s -> 5805.30s]  Did you smudge this in Photoshop? I don't know. Did you smudge this in Photoshop?
[5807.94s -> 5823.32s]  Are you sure? No, you definitely did. I don't actually look like that, right? Do I?
[5825.61s -> 5829.69s]  No, you did the smudge tool in Photoshop and you're just making me look like a fucking idiot.
[5834.84s -> 5858.12s]  Yeah, it's a smudge tool. No, it's not. Look at the clip. Oh no. Hold on. This is really,
[5858.12s -> 5872.50s]  hold on. What the fuck was that? Wait, what? No, what? Did I get linked to wrong browser?
[5884.50s -> 5892.57s]  Where did it come from? That was the noise. What is going on? It's the wrong video,
[5892.57s -> 5909.30s]  but the fucking Twitch clip is still here. Did you hear that? Right? Where is it coming from?
[5909.30s -> 5923.72s]  No bullets. No. Stop. Stop the browser. It's not even playing anymore. There's nothing on,
[5923.72s -> 5928.87s]  there's no browser playing right now. Therefore, it's impossible for there to be anything else.
[5931.77s -> 5943.05s]  Right? Oh my God. Where's it playing? No bullets. I don't have it open. I don't have it open
[5943.05s -> 5958.44s]  anywhere. I swear to God. Where is it open? This fucked up. Give me the steam overlay. No,
[5958.44s -> 5964.36s]  this is on the steam overlay browser. This is on the steam. I don't know how I did this.
[5965.32s -> 5971.11s]  I'm going to close every window. This music. I'm going to close. Every window is closed.
[5972.78s -> 5987.58s]  There are no windows open. This fucking clip does not exist anywhere. Oh my God. This is going to
[5987.58s -> 6019.22s]  drive me fucking crazy. Okay. Hold on. I fixed it. No, no, no, no, no. I don't look like that.
[6019.22s -> 6062.01s]  That's a Photoshop tool. Right? That's fucking horrible. I, I, no, I can't fucking believe it.
[6064.14s -> 6073.45s]  Thanos chin. Oh my God. I'm done. What? No, I thought that was the face I was making right now.
[6074.17s -> 6093.93s]  A sharp rubric of cannon fire echoes across San Francisco. President Wilson
[6093.93s -> 6096.41s]  commends his counteroffensive against the prize president's regime.
[6100.10s -> 6103.70s]  The liberation of the city struck a chord in the hearts of a small band of patriots
[6103.70s -> 6107.22s]  whose alabaster souls still believed in the freedom that Richard Hawke had stripped away.
[6108.02s -> 6111.14s]  MOA movement had been born and it wanted to talk to get the hell out of dog.
[6111.94s -> 6115.30s]  The wings of justice were spreading like an eagle. Here comes the president.
[6115.30s -> 6119.30s]  The information management department received an email that might interest you.
[6152.44s -> 6161.22s]  It's Thanos's really, really happy, like reverse, reverse brother. You know,
[6161.22s -> 6167.58s]  Thanos wants half the people gone. Uh, fairness was 50% more people.
[6182.82s -> 6195.02s]  An email. Actually, it's a sound file. Play it for me. Hey, here comes the sound. Yes, boss.
[6199.18s -> 6204.86s]  Didn't get very much of that. Uh, we are seeking volunteers to oppose the coup d'etat forces.
[6207.18s -> 6212.44s]  Two response from fellow sympathizers. The sound quality is terrible.
[6213.40s -> 6220.44s]  Could you try and contact the person who sent the email? Sure. Of course, boss. I ain't ever
[6220.44s -> 6226.44s]  going to beat this game. Maybe America's faith and freedom hasn't faded just yet. And Jody,
[6227.80s -> 6235.99s]  I'm taking back our country going from west to east. I mean, east, young man. What?
[6236.71s -> 6242.15s]  Huh? Mr. President, we got a message from the information management department.
[6246.89s -> 6250.33s]  The coup d'etat forces are making an announcement on national television.
[6251.29s -> 6260.97s]  Connect me. Here we go. Dear fellow Americans, good evening.
[6262.09s -> 6267.77s]  This is an announcement from the government policy promotion department where the password is
[6267.77s -> 6276.25s]  overflowing love and daily benevolence. Today, we bring you a most unfortunate bulletin.
[6277.75s -> 6285.67s]  Last evening, the city of San Francisco suffered extensive damage at the hand of metal wolf
[6285.67s -> 6293.03s]  who suddenly appeared. In addition to slaughtering unresisting citizens, this
[6293.03s -> 6301.91s]  heinous terrorist took citizens hostage and made an unjust demand for the release of violent
[6301.91s -> 6312.62s]  criminals and the sum of 500 million dollars. This vicious act could easily be the worst in
[6312.62s -> 6329.35s]  U.S. history. That like fake cry. Metal wolf's pilot is meaner than Satan himself.
[6330.65s -> 6338.17s]  And we will not permit him to get away with acts like this. We Americans will never
[6339.37s -> 6348.10s]  yield to such evil. We Americans will obtain our own justice.
[6348.42s -> 6351.78s]  All right, that's my line. Although martial law continues,
[6353.14s -> 6361.58s]  my fellow Americans, please bear with our situation to defend this lovable nation.
[6362.38s -> 6369.21s]  Let's lead the brave fight together. This has been an announcement from the government policy
[6369.21s -> 6374.81s]  promotion department where our motto justice over theory is your motto.
[6378.98s -> 6391.88s]  We've been made public enemy number one seeking exile. No, I'm the president. I can't be the one
[6391.88s -> 6398.20s]  to start a war in this country. I'll be the one to wage the war. Isn't that what is that you just
[6398.20s -> 6408.66s]  said? Mr. President. Hey Jody, update me on the situation in the west. Where we going? All right,
[6408.66s -> 6415.80s]  we got more. We got Grand Canyon, Alcatraz, Grand Canyon. Which one of these is the easiest?
[6417.56s -> 6426.06s]  This is, I mean, this is like, you know, this is Grand Canyon. Destroy the Alcatraz cannon.
[6427.19s -> 6431.91s]  Okay. On the prison island Alcatraz, only three kilometers offshore from San Francisco,
[6431.91s -> 6437.27s]  the enemy force is setting up a huge electromagnetic Alcatraz cannon to combat terrorism.
[6437.91s -> 6444.50s]  All the shelling in the desert region has implanted fear into the hearts of the people
[6444.50s -> 6449.46s]  on the west coast. The shelling is directed at keeping the dissidents in check. By destroying
[6449.46s -> 6455.30s]  the energy tanks around the Alcatraz cannon, you can stop its operation. The current is so strong
[6455.30s -> 6460.82s]  that no one has ever escaped from Alcatraz. Please be careful not to fall in the ocean.
[6460.82s -> 6465.86s]  Got a little closer to the mic. This mission goes by the call name. Call name.
[6471.53s -> 6478.58s]  Good one. Okay, I have a lot of money. We're gonna go and do some development.
[6480.23s -> 6487.19s]  Manufacturing investment. Okay. Let's see, shotguns, machine guns.
[6488.63s -> 6493.53s]  Let's get some development. No, assault rifles. Yeah, let's get some development.
[6494.49s -> 6505.06s]  Now I can make two of those. Let's do it again. That's it. I got it all. I can do more.
[6505.54s -> 6518.92s]  Should I do it again? I'm gonna do it again. Development level two. Yeah. SG-552. Yeah. All
[6518.92s -> 6543.19s]  right. Where is it? There's a new link. Of course there is. Okay. This is honestly, this is just
[6546.84s -> 6554.55s]  here. Hold on. Just color me green and make me a Hearthstone card. It's like, oh, there's
[6554.55s -> 6574.76s]  the greedy Grinner. It's a 1-1. Each time your hero takes damage, a coin is deposited into your
[6574.76s -> 6600.84s]  hand. Divine Shield 1-1. No, this. You guys are just bombarding me with links right now. Somebody
[6600.84s -> 6605.40s]  make it a Hearthstone card. It's not there. There's a template to make a Hearthstone card.
[6609.11s -> 6625.08s]  I want the greedy Grinner. Dr. Boomer. That was quick. Holy shit, that was quick. He didn't do it
[6625.08s -> 6671.10s]  that quick. What? This is so funny. It's just stupid because imagine this is a Hearthstone card.
[6673.18s -> 6681.34s]  Face. Face is green. And in the background, this is like foam. There's like a wall back there.
[6682.22s -> 6686.14s]  You can tell when Blizzard's gonna get real fucking lazy when they decide to do some shit like this.
[6692.92s -> 6698.63s]  Why would this have Divine Shield? Oh, I can have like a, yeah, a car, a car drop sound. Yeah.
[6700.46s -> 6718.90s]  Hold on. Give me a second. I'll get this. I gotta turn this off for a second though. This is
[6718.90s -> 6732.23s]  important. Okay. It's gonna be a little bigger than that. I'm gonna, I gotta like play the
[6732.23s -> 6743.98s]  card. You know what I mean? I gotta turn this off. This is fucking so stupid. Can you guys,
[6743.98s -> 6750.55s]  okay, tell me if you guys can still hear the, the in-game audio. You can't? Good. All right.
[6750.55s -> 6763.69s]  Here we go. Okay. I need a good sound effect. Like an electric splash.
[6776.58s -> 6779.38s]  Play the car. Here we go. Let me get a good voice for this one.
[6780.02s -> 6789.43s]  Ahem. I'll be taking that one.
[6795.02s -> 6827.06s]  Let me play. I'll be taking that one. This is doing it too many times. Okay. Let's get that
[6827.06s -> 6858.78s]  and the splash. Huge splash sound. That's it? No, I need a huge one. Big splash. Here we go.
[6858.78s -> 6882.14s]  In there. I'll be taking that one. It's a legendary. Come on. No, get this, get all this
[6882.14s -> 6887.35s]  shit off the screen. Get off everything. I need a Hearthstone board. Give me a Hearthstone board
[6887.35s -> 6906.90s]  image. Give me like a full hand in Hearthstone. Hearthstone board. Here we go. Okay. Doesn't
[6906.90s -> 6921.58s]  matter. This. Open Hearthstone. No, I'm not gonna open up Hearthstone for this shit.
[6949.54s -> 6959.35s]  Okay. I'm playing my card. I'm gonna tilt it a little. No, it's all right. I can just grab it.
[6959.35s -> 6973.02s]  No mana. It's three mana. It's enough. Here we go. What should I play here? I'm thinking maybe
[6976.07s -> 6981.51s]  end turn. No, I don't think so. I think I'm gonna play. The Greed of Grinner is a new
[6981.51s -> 6997.66s]  card. Seems pretty good. Let's just try it. I'll be taking that one. All right. So he's pretty good.
[6998.22s -> 7011.08s]  I think I would... I'll trade with the... I think I trade with the... Oh, I can't actually click
[7011.08s -> 7028.02s]  this. I'm a fucking idiot. There you go. Open... I'm not gonna open Hearthstone. No, I'm not gonna
[7028.02s -> 7076.98s]  play Hearthstone right now. That was the worst stream I've ever done. I don't even have to write.
[7076.98s -> 7090.06s]  I can't open up Hearthstone. I don't even know my password. The fuck is my Blizzard password?
[7090.06s -> 7106.58s]  I have no idea. Is that right? Got it. I have to update Hearthstone, guys. There's a new one.
[7107.38s -> 7127.38s]  Are you gonna make a hole? What did the stream become? I have... It's not gonna even work.
[7128.18s -> 7142.86s]  I have to wait to how Hearthstone is downloading right now. I have to play the computer for this
[7142.86s -> 7165.75s]  to be a thing. I need to get like a slam sound effect too of when it lands. That works. That's
[7165.83s -> 7170.92s]  really fucking loud. And I'm like, I'll be taking that one to the bank.
[7171.72s -> 7190.57s]  Lands. Okay. Program the card into the game. There's a new card. How many cards do I have?
[7198.81s -> 7201.53s]  This one doesn't have any transparency though. I can't use this one.
[7205.30s -> 7215.18s]  Why would you ever give your minions minus two attack? Oh, there is transparency on it. Okay.
[7227.06s -> 7232.34s]  Give all... Oh, give all minions. Okay. I see. I see. All right. We've waited long enough. I'm
[7232.34s -> 7249.90s]  doing it. Here we go. That's a new card though. That needs another sound effect.
[7268.57s -> 7284.18s]  That's for too long. This is actual clown stream. Yeah, what's he doing?
[7289.94s -> 7294.18s]  I'm not... That's not me doing that.
[7306.57s -> 7316.97s]  Okay.
[7330.49s -> 7333.61s]  Where am I? Okay. I'm sitting in a chair. I'm mad. I'm like, where am I?
[7335.45s -> 7342.28s]  Okay. Why is DOS games activated? Hey guys, did you know that evil miscreant got changed?
[7344.74s -> 7348.34s]  Don't care. Solo. Just play. How do you play against a computer? Tutorial?
[7348.98s -> 7357.35s]  How do I play against the computer? Solo Adventure? I don't know how to do this. How do you play
[7357.35s -> 7371.29s]  against a computer? There's so many things here. Wait, let me... I gotta get the game on the screen.
[7372.50s -> 7380.04s]  I'm only doing this once by the way, guys. I ain't doing this shit more than once.
[7380.60s -> 7384.89s]  I gotta get it and then I'm done and we'll move on. We're gonna move on.
[7388.07s -> 7393.51s]  Okay. Where is it? League of Explorers? Witchwood? Die... Oh, practice. Okay, practice.
[7395.85s -> 7407.18s]  Uh... I wonder how much I've played this. Okay. Custom Hunter. Custom Hunter 2.
[7407.18s -> 7410.54s]  This is probably not even filled out with enemies. With minions or anything. I don't even know which
[7410.54s -> 7421.11s]  one to pick. A classic Hunter 2? Custom Hunter 2. Uh, we're gonna... Who cares? We'll play against
[7421.11s -> 7436.92s]  a good mage. This doesn't matter. Custom Hunter Password 2. No, I'm not doing all these. I'm not
[7436.92s -> 7447.67s]  doing all these. I'm not gonna do this. Please. Don't do this to me. You know I'll stay here for
[7447.67s -> 7456.97s]  an hour and do this. I'm like a child. Okay, hold on. It actually does look like they belong
[7456.97s -> 7462.49s]  on the screen. Which one of these do I want to mulligan? I don't know. What is this deck?
[7469.75s -> 7480.31s]  I have to get down to no cards. Like one card. So I can have them down here. God damn it.
[7481.27s -> 7495.51s]  I'm gonna go. I'm gonna rope against the AI. Is that even possible? Okay, I need to get
[7495.51s -> 7510.44s]  rid of these cards. Who cares? Use Greedy Grinner. He's meta. Just wait. I need to get rid of this
[7510.44s -> 7538.95s]  shit. I need an empty hand. What am I in here for? Is this a bounty?
[7543.62s -> 7548.26s]  I don't know. What does this do? I'm doing like a good job.
[7550.82s -> 7559.85s]  I just want to clear the board. Okay, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's too many
[7559.85s -> 7580.63s]  cards. I'm gonna get this ready. I need a like a whoosh. Electric. Electric whoosh.
[7586.84s -> 7594.39s]  I'm just playing random cards. It's gonna be empty next time. Okay, electric whoosh. Synthetic
[7594.39s -> 7613.00s]  electric whoosh. Let's try it. Good. I like it. Dude, I'm doing better playing random cards than
[7613.00s -> 7625.94s]  I was trying to play this game. All right, here we go. Okay, I'm gonna have an empty hand here.
[7628.31s -> 7631.35s]  No, I want empty hands. No, I don't want more of this stuff.
[7633.51s -> 7638.89s]  I don't have enough room to play these cards. It's a full board.
[7653.35s -> 7656.87s]  No, I'm not playing Hearthstone right now. I gotta do this now. Like quick.
[7658.81s -> 7672.95s]  Okay, I need to get a six, seven, eight. Kill everybody. I need an empty board down here.
[7676.46s -> 7684.15s]  Good. Thank you. I appreciate the killer. Kill all this. Okay, here we go. It doesn't matter. I can
[7684.15s -> 7692.79s]  have one card in here. That's fine. All right, here we go. I'm gonna play my cards. That fits here.
[7695.74s -> 7710.57s]  That fits here. Let's get the other cards on here. Where is the other one? Here it is.
[7719.78s -> 7735.82s]  Blackwater Bay. Okay, where's that other one? There's one more. How many more of these do you
[7735.82s -> 7743.40s]  guys have? Pog moment? Do I have to set up a new sound for every one of these? I have to.
[7751.40s -> 7759.26s]  No, no, no. No, that's it. No more. I'm done. I'm done. No more of these. These other two
[7759.26s -> 7779.83s]  are coming in and that's it. You can't rope against the AI, right? Okay. Where's that other one?
[7780.47s -> 7797.22s]  I gotta like make these in audacity. If the opponent has a meltdown, win the game.
[7800.15s -> 7807.10s]  Oh my god. I have to make this full screen. Otherwise, I can't see the fuck I'm doing.
[7807.74s -> 7819.50s]  Okay, let's go. Why did I even open this? What was the point of having Hearthstone open?
[7820.14s -> 7827.75s]  There is no point. What? Just so this is animated? Okay, I'm gonna play my cards. I can only play
[7827.75s -> 7845.37s]  a couple in this turn. Let's try. I gotta turn the music up. No, it's all right. It's at a good
[7845.37s -> 7849.78s]  level. All right, here we go. This is important. I gotta keep this. I gotta do this right.
[7853.62s -> 7858.47s]  Ready? All right, so which one am I playing? I think I'm gonna play
[7859.86s -> 7867.08s]  Pog moment, I think. Give all memes in your hand a plus two term of Venus. Okay,
[7867.08s -> 7871.27s]  that sounds pretty good. Yeah, I think I'm gonna try this one.
[7876.01s -> 7882.09s]  Look at that fog jam. Preview. Oh, fuck you. Preview. All right, it's on.
[7882.65s -> 7891.11s]  Preview. Preview.
[7899.48s -> 7909.11s]  It ruined it. Imagine if Blizzard put in just like ripped audio from YouTube and it still had that
[7909.11s -> 7924.52s]  shit in it for sound effects. It's a spell. The game froze. All right, I need like a pirate song.
[7935.16s -> 7951.58s]  It's just accordion. It's just accordion. That's what it is. It's just the sound of an accordion.
[7951.58s -> 7960.17s]  Accordion. Windows 95 startup on accordion. What do you mean Windows 95 startup on accordion?
[7960.89s -> 7983.53s]  Accordion pirate. I can't. I have to stop this now. It doesn't matter. Okay, here we go.
[7984.97s -> 7993.34s]  All right. Your weapon's crossed too, lad. I'll get you from the. I'll get you from the side.
[7994.70s -> 8003.56s]  Check it out, boys. One at a time. Good. Record that. Let me be one at a time. There's only one
[8003.56s -> 8035.19s]  person. I'll be there waiting and watching. I don't know. Okay, you're just gonna watch.
[8036.15s -> 8053.91s]  I still got playing a mana. Okay, here we go. How about this one? Let's throw it on there.
[8054.55s -> 8065.37s]  Chad Jexington. This is legendary. You know it's gonna be good. I think I'm gonna place it.
[8065.37s -> 8071.98s]  Should I play it? Yeah. No, that's not what I wanted.
[8073.11s -> 8078.28s]  I want the sound. I want like that.
[8080.84s -> 8111.88s]  I don't think I should do it. I don't think I should do it. I'll play it.
[8111.88s -> 8115.94s]  Yeah, let's put it over here. Sounds like a plan.
[8121.74s -> 8124.14s]  Not funny. Not funny at all. Get it off. It's not funny.
[8125.93s -> 8135.06s]  That's not funny at all. It's already on the board, though. All right, this last one. Well,
[8135.06s -> 8149.93s]  there's two more. How about this one? Here we go. This will be good. Okay.
[8152.44s -> 8163.16s]  Your time is out. Like it. Print it. Here we go. Your time is up. No, time is out. No,
[8163.16s -> 8172.62s]  your time is out, right? Yeah. Your time is out. That's not as loud as I thought it was gonna be.
[8176.66s -> 8193.11s]  It's not what I wanted. No, not relaxing. All right, I'm done. That's it. The joke's over.
[8193.11s -> 8200.34s]  It's fine. It's over. I don't have to do it anymore. That was not what I wanted.
[8207.42s -> 8214.74s]  How is this not a sound? I just typed in electric shock and the first like 10 videos or at least
[8214.74s -> 8224.38s]  the first three videos are about G fuel. Is that like a flavor? I think that's a flavor of G fuel.
[8224.38s -> 8236.17s]  All right, how about this? This doesn't matter. I'm gonna play this card instead.
[8237.59s -> 8241.03s]  Hey, I'll be taking that money from you.
[8242.97s -> 8275.00s]  Hey, why can't I grab this shit anymore? I think I played Chad Jackson. Your time is up.
[8275.00s -> 8278.68s]  Oh my fucking god. I'm trying to lock it. Never mind. I almost just closed the whole screen.
[8278.68s -> 8302.26s]  I don't even know where whatever the metal wolf is still here, right? Yeah. All right. We're good.
[8302.26s -> 8316.49s]  Here's the entrance theme that you wanted. I'm walking on a call to arms. Tyrion forgery. Oh,
[8316.49s -> 8335.42s]  there it is. What is this sound in the background? Get out of my way.
[8336.22s -> 8352.98s]  I could be a fucking actor. Well, that was fun. Like the last three hours of the stream.
[8353.70s -> 8362.86s]  I could be a fucking actor. I think I could do it. All right. I gotta let I have to close
[8362.86s -> 8375.88s]  Hearthstone. At least let me just beat this though. I can beat this. Why are there two of these?
[8376.68s -> 8381.48s]  What the fuck is happening? This shouldn't be happening. There's two. I don't know why
[8381.48s -> 8391.56s]  there are two. This is supposed to be Hearthstone. Let me just finish the game. Hearthstone. That's
[8391.56s -> 8417.66s]  not Hearthstone. Oh my god. All right. Let me just win. I can do it still. Can I do it still?
[8418.30s -> 8446.52s]  It's still possible. He's gonna use it. I wasn't even trying to win. Give me a break. That was
[8446.52s -> 8452.04s]  not it. That's fine. I thought I can lose to the AI. I was doing a stupid thing. All right. What
[8452.04s -> 8457.38s]  is this capturing? Metal wolf chaos. There it is. That's the game that we're fucking playing. Not
[8457.38s -> 8467.34s]  this one. Yeah. That is actually dying to pinwheel. I know. I'm aware of that. I know some of you
[8467.34s -> 8473.61s]  are disgusted. But come on. What do you want me to do? I don't remember a single thing I was doing.
[8474.65s -> 8481.22s]  I don't know. I'm pretty certain that I was I wanted a better than missile launchers, right?
[8481.94s -> 8496.62s]  Sixty five thousand dollars. That's a lot. I have level two assault rifles. Oh, that was a lot of
[8496.62s -> 8506.07s]  bits came in. Yes is online. Give $50. Thank you. Thanks for the 5000 bits. I shouldn't have done
[8506.07s -> 8518.82s]  so much damage in one turn. God damn it. It's true. You shouldn't. I don't know. I shouldn't
[8518.82s -> 8526.18s]  have done that. You're right. New E mode. I don't know about that. All right. Machine guns. I want
[8526.18s -> 8534.70s]  better machine guns. MP7 ST. Where's the audio? Oh, right. I turned it all the way down.
[8538.02s -> 8553.37s]  There we go. There's that music. Okay. That looks good. Should I do it? No. Now I need to actually
[8553.37s -> 8561.06s]  buy these things. Should I do bazookas? I'll do bazookas. No, I have plenty of missile grenade
[8561.06s -> 8582.62s]  launchers. No rail gun. The flamethrower kind of sucks. The M72A3 is now available. I need to go
[8582.62s -> 8592.89s]  through these and see what they even do. Okay. Back up here. So this is 700. 7600. These are
[8593.77s -> 8601.13s]  energy cost zero. Starting capacity. Precision targeting. Fires high powered rockets.
[8602.17s -> 8609.38s]  High explosive rockets. Heavy arms. Standard rounds. Firepower. This thing sucks.
[8610.34s -> 8624.76s]  Is this range? Why wouldn't you just use the default? It doesn't use a warning. Okay,
[8624.76s -> 8633.64s]  I have new ones. No, I don't. Go back to Hearthstone. No, you don't want me to play Hearthstone.
[8634.68s -> 8642.68s]  I can guarantee you do not want me to do that. All right. MP7. 100. More capacity. Rate of fire.
[8643.80s -> 8646.84s]  Intercepting. Oh, this is... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to need that.
[8647.80s -> 8660.74s]  Give me this thing. Energy rounds. That sounds kind of cool. Let's try it. I also have assault.
[8660.74s -> 8670.42s]  Here we go. I got the SG552. Upgraded range and firepower. I'll take it. Oh, no, I can't take it.
[8671.38s -> 8683.56s]  I'm blind. What's going on? I got... No, that's fine. I'll come back.
[8684.76s -> 8692.90s]  Let's equip. Get on there. Let's actually play the game. I know people are going to start snoozing
[8692.90s -> 8705.86s]  once we go from Hearthstone cards. I want this. I don't want the shotgun. It's all right. You can
[8705.86s -> 8715.64s]  snooze if you want. All right, here's the regular bazooka. We'll wake you up later. Don't worry.
[8716.52s -> 8727.13s]  Keep that there. I need to... I feel like the handgun. Why would I even use the handgun?
[8728.09s -> 8738.70s]  I think this is fine for now. Yeah, this is good. This is good. I'll be all right with this.
[8741.30s -> 8745.51s]  Save the game. Now, technically, I have been playing this game for like two hours,
[8745.51s -> 8749.51s]  but that's not true. See? That's not true. I've only played this game for about an hour and 10 minutes.
[8750.47s -> 8759.13s]  Wake me up before you go. Okay. Enemy forces occupy Alcatraz Island.
[8760.55s -> 8766.95s]  Jodie, what is that daunting thing? The Alcatraz cannon. How original.
[8768.63s -> 8774.71s]  You'd never make it on Madison Avenue. Stomp and surrender, Metal Wolf.
[8776.74s -> 8783.38s]  Surrender? If you fail to comply, the Alcatraz cannon will zap you backwards, coach. Will it now?
[8785.85s -> 8789.85s]  Not if I zap it first. So just take out the cannon? That's kind of cool.
[8791.21s -> 8797.34s]  Mr. President, the Alcatraz cannon just started to recharge.
[8798.14s -> 8802.70s]  I'm on the move. I'll smash it faster than a Florida Rico.
[8802.70s -> 8808.36s]  Siri, what's the weather like today? A gun battery. 65 degrees and charming.
[8810.04s -> 8818.84s]  Five minutes? In the center of the island. Wait a minute. This is DNN's Peter McDonald reporting.
[8819.48s -> 8823.48s]  That's the heinous terrorist, Metal Wolf, as seen from the air.
[8823.48s -> 8830.12s]  He's trying to take over the Alcatraz cannon and destroy the west coast. DNN is coming to you live
[8830.12s -> 8836.87s]  and exclusively as these events unfold. Forget him and keep your mind on the mission.
[8836.87s -> 8839.99s]  Mission. Mind on the mission. Let's go. I got five minutes to get up there.
[8840.63s -> 8845.11s]  I know. This device also seems to supply energy to the Alcatraz cannon.
[8845.11s -> 8848.63s]  You should destroy it in order to decrease the energy recharge supply.
[8849.67s -> 8869.00s]  I need a... There we go. The ham. Damn, this thing is beefy. This thing's beefy, man.
[8870.04s -> 8884.44s]  Oh, clocks. Clocks. Clocks. Clocks. Oops. Sorry. Oh, shit. Clocks. Clocks. Clocks. It's blocking up.
[8884.44s -> 8909.03s]  Clocks. I gotta have to move, man. Bang. Watch this one. Even set cool. Oops.
[8909.03s -> 8925.48s]  Oops. Gotta be quicker. Mr. President.
[8928.60s -> 8966.71s]  I can't move. Come on, get it. I kinda just keep telling you that.
[8966.71s -> 8987.16s]  You may or may not already know. There's two of these.
[8994.66s -> 8999.27s]  I didn't surrender. What happened?
[8999.27s -> 9004.07s]  Come on. If you lie down and sleep here, you'll get sent by the Alcatraz cannon.
[9004.07s -> 9006.34s]  Mr. President. Is this scripted?
[9006.34s -> 9015.03s]  It's a battery. That thing should take five minutes to recharge.
[9016.07s -> 9017.11s]  It was the landmines.
[9020.07s -> 9022.23s]  Oh, right. It was the landmines.
[9022.23s -> 9024.71s]  Mr. President, keep your mind on the mission, Mr. President.
[9024.71s -> 9026.79s]  Laugh with me. Laugh with me. Mr. President.
[9026.79s -> 9040.78s]  I was watching Germany yesterday and I'm kind of like a fan. He's like,
[9041.50s -> 9046.38s]  I, I, I, he's like kind of fucked up yesterday, but I didn't like that one.
[9048.62s -> 9064.81s]  7200 fucking uploads. Yeah, I agree. Something was weird about that stream. It was like, not very
[9064.81s -> 9077.77s]  fun. 16,000 uploads. On the page, on the page, all slash all. Yeah, I just like saw this on all.
[9077.77s -> 9082.74s]  Like, I don't know who this guy is. But like, I guess I'll check it out and that's weird.
[9084.74s -> 9124.70s]  Didn't hit. Get it. Cool. You can't fall off yet, can you? I don't know. Can you? Is that,
[9124.70s -> 9128.22s]  does it count? It actually does count. I just had to test. I didn't, I didn't know. I had to
[9128.22s -> 9132.22s]  test it. I had to test it. I had to test it. I had to test it. I needed to know. I needed to know.
[9132.22s -> 9136.38s]  I watched that stream yesterday and like, I wasn't a fan. I just, I didn't know if you'd,
[9136.38s -> 9141.02s]  of course, it's a Dark Souls game. A gun battery that big should take five minutes to recharge.
[9141.02s -> 9145.26s]  Until then, head for the Alcatraz cannon in the center of the island.
[9145.34s -> 9149.80s]  Forget him and keep your mind on the mission, Mr. President.
[9154.33s -> 9164.63s]  I know. Come on. Yeah, I'm from all, like, I know. Is he a YouTuber or something? Like, a streamer?
[9167.29s -> 9182.66s]  That's kind of fucked up that his streaming didn't do fun today, though. I'm getting the
[9182.66s -> 9190.31s]  creeps. Musician was among the POWs you rescued. He was forced to perform to entertain the troops.
[9193.22s -> 9196.26s]  More. Actually, can I put the assault rifle on here? I think I need it.
[9197.06s -> 9210.12s]  Of course you can. What a blasted game, huh? The helicopters are the worst. They don't want
[9210.12s -> 9227.16s]  to shoot the missiles. I have to get them done immediately. They are the worst. Don't fall off
[9227.16s -> 9236.92s]  the edge like you did last time. It's not that hard. Get with it. There's two, right?
[9240.82s -> 9244.02s]  It's the landmines. Watch out for them. Blow them up. I can blow them up, right?
[9244.02s -> 9258.68s]  No? Yeah, I can. This is tricky here. This is tricky.
[9260.68s -> 9272.87s]  Let's get some of those on here from distance. Pretty good. They can't even fire.
[9273.67s -> 9283.10s]  That should be enough. Is that not enough? I'm sorry. My real voice is coming out. I'm from
[9283.10s -> 9295.83s]  Boston. Fucking dude. Military is being decimated. Platoon after platoon. That's it, right? Be careful.
[9310.89s -> 9316.92s]  Where's that new weapon? Did I not equip it? I didn't even equip the damn thing. You serious?
[9318.41s -> 9330.47s]  No, I did. Didn't I? Oh shit. Oh shit. That's gonna kill me. No, no. The stupid missiles. The airborne
[9330.47s -> 9350.92s]  missiles. Okay, hang on. Don't forget. When the going gets tough, the tough get going, Mr. President.
[9350.92s -> 9365.51s]  Yes. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Activate.
[9401.85s -> 9423.85s]  I gotta hurry up. No, I'm taking damage. Stupid. 70%. Come on.
[9430.49s -> 9431.13s]  How do I get up there?
[9435.69s -> 9447.85s]  Your cruelty won't go unpunished. Did I go all the way down to the beginning of the level?
[9448.81s -> 9466.57s]  I did, didn't I? Come on. Are you serious? Where was the way to go?
[9468.41s -> 9480.74s]  Down this way. Can I still do it? Please don't make a gun. I think I can do it.
[9489.18s -> 9507.86s]  Come on. Hey, get that on the news. Open the door. Open the door.
[9513.10s -> 9520.14s]  So the U.S. military has had something up its sleeve. Those who interfere will be eliminated.
[9523.53s -> 9527.66s]  95%. It's already charged. This doesn't just shoot, right?
[9533.42s -> 9539.66s]  Oh god. Destroy all of them. I have to destroy all of them. All of them. It's getting 97%.
[9556.15s -> 9563.74s]  If you shoot, I'll hold it against you forever. Get us out of here.
[9573.27s -> 9578.31s]  That sucks. I just have to go. Forget about everything else. We have to go fast now. Hurry.
[9581.43s -> 9643.53s]  Oh my god. No, I want this. Hurry. Oh shit. I'm screwed up. I need this thing. The interception
[9643.61s -> 9692.68s]  one. No, I didn't want to fucking do that. I hit accidentally. Come on. Double it up. Double it
[9692.68s -> 9703.30s]  up. Double it up. Double it up. Double it up. What's hurting me? What's happening? The game
[9703.30s -> 9708.82s]  is so broken. If you die really fast, it doesn't matter. Mr. President, you're too nervous.
[9708.82s -> 9714.71s]  You've lost the first step. The faster you die, if I'm going to die, I need to get hit by like
[9714.71s -> 9729.45s]  a thousand damage. Why is this taking so fucking long? I'm shooting the two rockets at the same
[9729.45s -> 9735.05s]  time. 40%. I'm not going to do it. The U.S. military is being decimated.
[9737.85s -> 9757.69s]  I got to use that. I need that thing to be charged now.
[9782.04s -> 9816.95s]  I know it takes forever to kill everything. I'm in. Let's go. Come on.
[9819.62s -> 9849.40s]  The POWs you rescued. They were struggling. Shoot it. Okay.
[9851.21s -> 9862.86s]  Go. The army has been completely vaporized. Metal Wolf, your cruelty won't go unpunished.
[9862.86s -> 9872.34s]  Open the door. I have. That's the super thing. Open the door, please. Why does it take this long?
[9872.34s -> 9902.06s]  How do I? Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Justice. Range. Oh, fuck. I forgot that game's
[9902.06s -> 9918.01s]  like no longer relevant right now. It's not 2016. Shit. Come on. It's almost done. Got it.
[9918.01s -> 9936.31s]  You could seize the area. Under military orders, the soldiers blew up the Alcatraz cannon.
[9936.31s -> 9941.59s]  Simply amazing. Clap for me. In real life. The U.S. military gets the job done no matter what.
[9941.59s -> 9947.11s]  You better all be doing this. Better double check his back. Today, once again,
[9947.67s -> 9954.23s]  U.S. military forces were dealt a lethal blow by Metal Wolf. But thanks to these heroes in our
[9954.23s -> 9959.75s]  military, Metal Wolf and his conspiracy have been held in check. Our hearts go out to the men and
[9959.75s -> 9965.51s]  women who sacrificed their lives in battle and to their families as well. Any further reporting
[9965.51s -> 9971.83s]  is too dangerous. Our news team is seeking refuge. Be the first to know as we continue pursuing
[9971.83s -> 9979.03s]  Metal Wolf because yes, the pen is still mightier than the sword. This has been Peter McDonald for
[9979.03s -> 9988.66s]  DNA. It's exhausting to listen to. What the hell? But at least the west coast is safe now.
[9988.66s -> 9994.18s]  Yeah, that helicopter was a toy. Mr. President. It reminds me of old Star Wars movies when they
[9994.18s -> 10007.64s]  used the real models, the real miniatures. A, E, D, D. I'll get a C. No, I won't. $70,000,
[10007.64s -> 10015.86s]  $80,000. I got some scientists. All right. Brought peace to the west coast and gave the
[10015.86s -> 10020.18s]  resistance a new momentum. But Richard Hawke's messaging continued to have a stronghold on the
[10020.18s -> 10026.66s]  American people. Destroy Metal Wolf, we cried along like hysterical. Brainwash children.
[10026.66s -> 10031.06s]  And that ignorant chorus became the battle hymn of our presence. In time, we would be made
[10031.06s -> 10036.50s]  painfully aware of just the line we were. By the way, Jody, what happened with yesterday's email?
[10038.14s -> 10042.46s]  The information management department succeeded in contacting the source of the email.
[10043.91s -> 10051.64s]  Really? Let me hear it. Inform the resistance to put a stop to Richard Hawke and his recklessness.
[10051.64s -> 10056.92s]  Is this me talking? Right now, I'm aiming for a united uprising and seek volunteers.
[10057.64s -> 10064.76s]  What about those events? Metal Wolf, we eagerly await your rampage. Great. They haven't sold out
[10064.76s -> 10074.98s]  hope yet. Mr. President, I haven't been this happy since... My anniversary. My birthday.
[10075.86s -> 10080.26s]  When I got the job. When I went down a really tall water slide. When I went down the rollercoaster.
[10080.26s -> 10087.70s]  Since that supermarket going out of business sale. When I was searching for my favorite candy and...
[10088.50s -> 10099.32s]  They had a... It was 60% off and I got to buy like 10 boxes of it. And I ran into a celebrity
[10099.32s -> 10107.06s]  and we had a conversation. I found the last at the back of the... And the expiration date was still
[10107.06s -> 10111.70s]  good. I know the feeling, Jody. Sure, Mr. President. Oh yeah, I know the feeling.
[10112.74s -> 10125.27s]  All right, let's go to the Grand Canyon. Operating out of a massive helicopter base
[10125.27s -> 10130.95s]  constructed in the Grand Canyon, enemy continue to oppress the American west.
[10131.59s -> 10137.03s]  The target area terrain is sure to be confusingly fierce because the enemy army has taken over
[10137.03s -> 10142.95s]  guerrilla bases from the Arizona insurrection days. Please watch your step so you don't fall into the
[10142.95s -> 10147.11s]  one mile deep ravine. I'm gonna die here like three times. Use artillery with long range firing
[10147.11s -> 10152.55s]  effectively and destroy all the target areas. Long range. This mission goes by the call name...
[10154.07s -> 10154.87s]  Don't look down.
[10166.28s -> 10171.45s]  Next week. These are all next week on X anime.
[10179.85s -> 10201.94s]  That also is a next week anime. All right, let's do... I need range here.
[10203.54s -> 10206.58s]  I'm gonna do... I'm doing it. It's insanely expensive but I'm going for it.
[10207.54s -> 10212.63s]  The ml14 jaw. That's all I... I can't do anything else.
[10214.71s -> 10222.73s]  This thing... $46,000. 1820 damage. That's pretty damn good.
[10231.98s -> 10243.53s]  Lock on speed F. They're all F. What's the range? B? That's not that. What? I need
[10244.17s -> 10265.64s]  speed. Yeah, I know. I need range. S. I'm gonna get two of these. I want one in each hand. So ham ham.
[10270.23s -> 10275.11s]  Uh, what? This is... this range is terrible. So I'm gonna replace this with something that has
[10275.11s -> 10279.75s]  better range. I'm not sure I have anything that has better range. I guess I do.
[10281.50s -> 10286.89s]  Yeah. I want the interceptor. That works really well. The range on this is
[10286.89s -> 10299.13s]  absolutely terrible. I mean, I guess I just do... Sniper? Just because. I guess. It's got range.
[10300.09s -> 10315.37s]  Okay. All right. Let's go. Begin.
[10338.42s -> 10339.86s]  No. I don't know.
[10341.69s -> 10350.70s]  All right. Let's rock and roll. So I need a range for this. Why? Mr. President,
[10350.70s -> 10355.42s]  the view certainly is grand. But stop with the don't look down joke, please.
[10357.10s -> 10371.53s]  I made one of those before we even started the level. Didn't take it out. I'm gonna say how.
[10372.49s -> 10379.45s]  She just did a minus two here. I... yeah. I know. That's what I'm saying.
[10379.45s -> 10413.10s]  Okay. So it's under here? Underneath? I don't know. Come on. Tap it. Oh, that was actually
[10413.10s -> 10432.44s]  pretty cool. That was cool. There's the target over there. Get double ham on this. It's not even ham,
[10432.44s -> 10458.62s]  but... Can I fly over this? Oh, shit. Hold on. Get it. Come on. Hit it.
[10464.66s -> 10473.50s]  So now I have to go across this. I can go over there though, right? I hope so. You're gonna make
[10473.50s -> 10502.44s]  it? Go free. I need boost for this. I don't want to fuck this up. I want double ham. Oh,
[10502.44s -> 10506.36s]  okay. I was not holding down space. I should shift. I don't know. I died. That's not,
[10506.36s -> 10524.84s]  that's not worth dying for that. Get rid of the chopper. Scientists to maintain helicopters.
[10525.40s -> 10536.55s]  That's what you're saying? How was I only hitting one person?
[10551.34s -> 10565.16s]  What a stupid way to say that. Shoot it. Shoot it. This interceptor is so good. How did I ever
[10565.16s -> 10596.92s]  live without this? Oh! They're dead. They're dead. Double ham. Oh, you can just ride them
[10596.92s -> 10628.74s]  to him too. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're me? No. You're me. Lock on. Go hard. There's
[10628.74s -> 10651.30s]  somebody that can react harder. Go harder. P-hugger. React more? That shit is so fucking
[10651.30s -> 10676.74s]  ridiculous. I want more reactions. Be louder. Talk louder. He actually wants that. Oh, boss?
[10684.73s -> 10688.82s]  Oh, great. It's a helicopter.
[10702.41s -> 10705.37s]  Well, I'm keeping out the interceptor. No doubt.
[10707.51s -> 10731.50s]  Oh, yeah. Are you kidding me? Shit. I look more into this fucking thing, aren't I?
[10733.53s -> 10774.74s]  Oh, God. He dies before that happens. That was so easy. Oh, my God. I didn't even have to play
[10774.74s -> 10783.67s]  the game. I thought it was just a mini-boss, guys. That wasn't the real thing. Just a mini-boss.
[10784.63s -> 10817.85s]  I only have rockets. I just don't love rockets. Look down. There's still stuff over there that I
[10817.85s -> 10863.56s]  gotta get across the way. Where? Where is this thing? Where? Where is this? Oh, it's above.
[10863.56s -> 10873.64s]  How do I get up there? Just shoot? Just shoot it? Just take out the bridge?
[10873.64s -> 10923.35s]  The chat is more entertaining with Jupiter than with me. I guarantee it. Oh, I am going.
[10923.35s -> 10931.77s]  All right. What did you get for having fun in chat? Yeah, you guys are funny. You guys are fun.
[10932.49s -> 10940.58s]  The game's not in what you like. You know, just have fun. Just chill. Talk. Talk to each other.
[10940.58s -> 10948.68s]  Communicate with each other. It's pretty fun. It's fun enough to play. You know, communicate.
[10949.48s -> 10961.42s]  Down to the Colorado River. Double ham. The defense strength is high against live ammunition.
[10962.94s -> 10981.93s]  Stay behind the wall. That's an instant death if I get to by this.
[10983.05s -> 11018.78s]  I guarantee. You guys need to be communicating. Still live? I'm shooting them out of the air.
[11018.78s -> 11048.12s]  This drama is short and bald for anybody else. Like, your TV's fucked up. Come on.
[11049.48s -> 11066.86s]  Got it. I'm just not going to put up with it anymore, you know?
[11067.82s -> 11073.74s]  Why would I do that? I can say, hey.
[11085.90s -> 11086.70s]  How is that possible?
[11089.69s -> 11092.31s]  Yeah, I'm just not going to stand for it anymore.
[11095.91s -> 11098.95s]  Yeah, no, you're not going to stand. Because you have to stand to be able to see.
[11100.15s -> 11138.49s]  Not ideal, but I'm good. I missed the old drama that played Hearthstone an hour ago.
[11138.81s -> 11141.05s]  The enemy has been annihilated.
[11141.05s -> 11143.67s]  Now I'm turning it over to relief. No more Hearthstone.
[11143.67s -> 11149.43s]  Easily brought to Arizona. It really doesn't suit these lovely surroundings.
[11152.89s -> 11158.28s]  Jodie, nor someone as lovely as you.
[11159.61s -> 11162.41s]  Sure, whatever. Nice work, Mr. President.
[11163.29s -> 11184.07s]  What the hell are you talking about? S-B-C-D-A. First A. $200,000. Nice.
[11189.30s -> 11192.42s]  Victory in the Grand Canyon proved to be significant. Without the enemy helicopter
[11192.42s -> 11196.18s]  squadron to pin them down, the resistance fighters were able to continue their march.
[11196.82s -> 11199.22s]  Peace had returned to Arizona, where folks came up with the saying,
[11199.22s -> 11203.30s]  where there's a Wilson, there's a way. The man they had mocked as a rebel army major
[11203.30s -> 11207.06s]  had elevated himself to presidential standing again, and people were starting to believe
[11207.06s -> 11209.94s]  this man had a chance. DNN correspondent Peter McDonald.
[11210.74s -> 11215.85s]  Any word from the resistance? Yes, I'll play it for you now.
[11216.73s -> 11221.54s]  Wolf, we applaud and appreciate your efforts.
[11222.42s -> 11227.16s]  Our leadership has started to rise one brave soul at a time.
[11227.16s -> 11232.12s]  You got it! The efforts and our activities,
[11232.12s -> 11235.24s]  hoping that the day we revolt will come soon.
[11235.24s -> 11242.74s]  I'd like to see that day too. Yeah.
[11245.30s -> 11249.13s]  I feel like a mother hen. Okay, Mr. President,
[11249.13s -> 11253.45s]  you best hurry and get to the next battle theater. Battle theater?
[11254.41s -> 11260.71s]  All right, Phoenix. What's over here? Oh, right, I did that. All right, let's do Phoenix.
[11261.75s -> 11267.38s]  The enemy force is apparently carrying out co-campaigns based in a ghost town in the
[11267.38s -> 11270.10s]  Phoenix suburbs. I feel like a mother hen.
[11270.98s -> 11272.74s]  I feel like a mother hen. This is the voice.
[11274.10s -> 11277.62s]  I could have done a much better job. I feel like a mother hen.
[11278.42s -> 11283.08s]  I feel like a mother hen. No, that's not good.
[11283.08s -> 11293.27s]  The Raider's fleet. This mission goes by the convoy operation.
[11294.15s -> 11298.55s]  I liked it. I thought it was good too. Good luck and godspeed, Mr. President.
[11302.65s -> 11306.01s]  All right, you want me to develop some multi-missiles?
[11307.05s -> 11313.00s]  Let's take a look. Multi-missile launcher. That's expensive to start.
[11315.51s -> 11321.02s]  MMLA. Let's do it again. Again.
[11324.06s -> 11329.66s]  MMLA-QLS. Do it again. No, I want some money left over.
[11329.66s -> 11338.07s]  MMLA-QLS. What are you talking about? Check this pole. What pole?
[11339.11s -> 11344.89s]  Check the pole. What do you mean the pole? What are you guys trying to say? What are you
[11344.89s -> 11356.18s]  trying to say? What are you saying? Pole, pole, pole. I'm not going back to play that.
[11356.18s -> 11360.66s]  What do you mean should I go back and play? We don't go back. We go forward.
[11361.46s -> 11383.53s]  No, we already had a chance with that game and it's over. We go forward. Go back and play the
[11383.61s -> 11394.84s]  acid game. No way. No, you guys got to sleep in this bed. I was told, get out of this.
[11396.12s -> 11409.13s]  I don't like this. Next, next, next. We didn't ask for this. Oh, yes, you did.
[11409.93s -> 11413.61s]  I did a poll before the stream started. This is like 80% of people said to play this one.
[11414.49s -> 11418.78s]  I was told to play this one. This one's episode is from Toby at the beginning of the stream.
[11421.66s -> 11425.18s]  All right, let me look and see what these do. Look, you guys just like talk to each other,
[11425.18s -> 11439.26s]  communicate with each other. This is just better. Is there another one? Why is it level three?
[11440.46s -> 11451.88s]  I'll give it a try. I'm going to get two of them. I also wanted to do,
[11455.26s -> 11461.30s]  it was a couple of these that I wanted, right? No, no, no, this one here, the SG, this one.
[11462.18s -> 11470.90s]  It's expensive. It's good though. Bazookas. I didn't need, I had another one of these too.
[11475.54s -> 11479.86s]  Range B, starting capacity, high explosive rockets. I'll try this one.
[11485.86s -> 11493.54s]  You guys just have to talk to each other, you know? I can't get this one. It's all right.
[11496.94s -> 11504.09s]  La Cranda, thanks for the $50. 5000 bits from La Cranda. Thank you so much for the huge amount
[11504.09s -> 11520.33s]  of money. And they say, uh, do something funny like the acid game. Guaranteed. Oh, it is too.
[11523.24s -> 11531.80s]  Playing that game. That double hand is still fine. I don't want this anymore.
[11532.68s -> 11540.74s]  Did I get the flamethrower? No, I need the, uh, the interceptor. Interceptor and,
[11541.78s -> 11555.26s]  I mean, are you a furry? I, you know, that's, but I don't care. All right. I'm ready. Save the game.
[11556.52s -> 11562.70s]  Stream's not bopping anymore. Yes, it is. This stream is bopping right now.
[11565.69s -> 11570.25s]  Look, let me, let me play my game that I want to play. I want to play this fun game.
[11571.13s -> 11578.89s]  You're becoming unruly and we're in the wild west. Like a town in an old western,
[11580.60s -> 11587.32s]  a radar jamming station is located here. The number of target areas and enemies seem limited.
[11587.32s -> 11591.56s]  If you have to say something bopping, that means it's not bopping. I know that's true.
[11592.44s -> 11596.92s]  That's like you throw a party. You hire like a DJ and you have a big space. You rent out like a
[11596.92s -> 11605.24s]  club for a night and the DJ is playing, just spinning records. Sounds awesome. It's you,
[11605.24s -> 11609.32s]  your best friend and like one or two other people that actually accepted and went to the Facebook
[11609.32s -> 11613.40s]  invite. There's nobody else there. And you're like walking around like, this is pretty sick, huh?
[11614.20s -> 11619.00s]  This is bopping. You've tarnished the good name of the U.S. military
[11619.00s -> 11623.40s]  and your reputation as a hero. And now you'll die for it.
[11624.60s -> 11636.49s]  Whatever. Am I going to play this for the rest of the night? I don't know. Once I get like done
[11636.49s -> 11640.01s]  with it or bored with it, maybe we'll do something else. Maybe we'll do something else. I don't know.
[11640.01s -> 11649.69s]  Wanna find out who gets to play Wyatt Earp? Here we go. We got Paul, Randy and Shaq.
[11650.49s -> 11661.30s]  Uh, I don't even know who they are.
[11665.51s -> 11698.47s]  Paul. Hey, what's up? I'm out of missiles. How is that possible? Who's this guy?
[11702.50s -> 11710.86s]  Stomp, for God's sake, stomp. I don't know where he's going to play this for another four hours.
[11712.76s -> 11714.60s]  I don't think I'm even going to scream for another four hours.
[11715.32s -> 11720.47s]  Hey, sir, you're corrupt. You were never. He's to relax.
[11723.06s -> 11727.14s]  There's no victory for a man who loses his pride. Have you had enough?
[11727.86s -> 11735.82s]  But I put you out of your misery now. All right. Right now I may as well be loaded into like a TV
[11735.82s -> 11740.86s]  show. Like I'm just watching it on my screen over on the right. It's like a radio show.
[11740.86s -> 11745.90s]  Roger that. Leave the good stuff for me. This is like a daytime drama.
[11745.90s -> 11751.34s]  The best medicine for that kind of headache is pumping it full of a heavy dose of lead.
[11752.22s -> 11764.74s]  I think it's all people that are saying, hey, dude, this game sucks. I don't think they know.
[11765.62s -> 11773.38s]  This is from stop working. No, I meant to say, oh, fuck. No, I have to like every one of those.
[11775.22s -> 11792.17s]  That's all right. I like it, I think. Dude, who made this fucking shitty game? It sucks.
[11792.17s -> 11802.81s]  So it's fucking stupid from software. What I meant to say was, oh, whoops. It's not my thing.
[11802.81s -> 11816.50s]  It's not my kind of game. I don't think. No, I'm right in front of you, dude.
[11830.06s -> 11831.02s]  Maybe it's not for me.
[11831.02s -> 11856.74s]  I don't even know where they are. My mini map is jammed.
[11862.79s -> 11867.98s]  Oh, that's what's happening. I can't. I'm going to go around and display.
[11868.70s -> 11873.82s]  You do rescue. He was forced to sing the blues for the truth. The defense strength is high
[11873.82s -> 11877.34s]  against live ammunition. I probably should just go and kill the one of them.
[11884.18s -> 11910.82s]  This thing is invisible. Going somewhere to destroy targets or something before I can
[11910.90s -> 11919.37s]  probably like. Yeah, this thing is jamming. Installation is the best medicine for that
[11919.37s -> 11924.81s]  kind of headache is pumping it full of a heavy dose of lead. Now, you're about to have a headache
[11924.81s -> 11944.76s]  when you play this game. Summer morning were among the POWs you rescued. They were probably
[11944.76s -> 11955.72s]  used to develop new type mobile unit armor. I don't come. I don't look. It's like if you come
[11955.72s -> 11965.11s]  in the light. Never mind. As I say, like it might be a plain game. Like your brother comes in,
[11966.31s -> 11974.63s]  friend comes in, sitting there like, hey, what are you playing? Oh, I'm playing Metal Wolf Chaos.
[11975.35s -> 11983.32s]  Oh, cool. This game's stupid. OK, I think it's all right. I think it's kind of fun to kind of
[11983.32s -> 11991.00s]  run around and just like kind of walk on. No, this game's bad. This game's stupid. Yeah. All
[11991.00s -> 11999.91s]  right, man. You want to go home or you want to stay? No, no, I'm gonna stay. OK. You want to go
[11999.91s -> 12004.79s]  get food or something? No, I'm going to sit here and just tell you every five minutes that I hate
[12004.79s -> 12015.18s]  this game and I don't like it. Why are you here? Why are you doing this to me? I don't know.
[12015.18s -> 12021.82s]  What did I do? Are you upset with me? No, no, not at all. I think our friendship is very,
[12021.82s -> 12041.27s]  very good. No, I think that too. Oh, and by the way, no, by the way, not only do I not like this,
[12041.27s -> 12048.94s]  you're doing it wrong. Am I? Yeah, yeah, yeah. This game sucks and you're doing it wrong.
[12049.58s -> 12053.10s]  I thought you didn't like this game. No, I don't. But you're doing it wrong and you're stupid and
[12053.10s -> 12067.67s]  you're bad. Oh, and yeah, dude, by the way, I'm like back here right now. Kind of sitting behind
[12067.67s -> 12085.75s]  you. You're bald as fuck. OK. Oh, are you sure we're friends? You're really bald today.
[12087.98s -> 12092.06s]  I would like to call my mother and be like, Mom, can you come in here and like tell him to go home?
[12099.30s -> 12102.97s]  All right, let's see if I can get through here. Get your pork chops ready.
[12114.74s -> 12116.98s]  I don't know if it's just me, too, but there's like a smell on this room.
[12118.18s -> 12122.89s]  Is that you? Is that your body? Your body smells. I've been sitting here for a while,
[12122.89s -> 12134.15s]  dude. Maybe I am like, I don't know. OK, now that one I could forget because I mean,
[12134.15s -> 12137.51s]  if you like smell bad, like you don't like it. Never mind. That one's fine.
[12139.94s -> 12155.70s]  All right, let's go with the real deal here. Can you shoot him? Nice. One more of those.
[12164.07s -> 12179.37s]  Diaper check. Diaper check. Hey, man, like, yeah, you having a good time by hanging over at my house?
[12179.93s -> 12184.57s]  Yeah, yeah, I'm having a good time. I guess the game's not that bad or whatever. I just I like
[12184.57s -> 12188.41s]  hanging out with you. I like, yeah, just like kind of hanging out with you, too. Yeah, it's
[12188.41s -> 12193.45s]  fun to know what you're doing. You can be playing something, you can be eating something, hanging
[12193.45s -> 12197.77s]  out. I like being I like when you're here, too. Oh, by the way, show me your diaper.
[12198.57s -> 12209.75s]  Can I diaper check? No. What are you talking about? This is not fair, though, because this would be
[12212.63s -> 12217.83s]  this is not fair because I did like shake around and pretend I had a diaper on. So like if I
[12218.79s -> 12222.39s]  was if my friend was over and I'd like shook around and pretended to have a diaper on
[12222.39s -> 12226.31s]  and then later on he was like, dude, diaper check. Come on. Like, what the fuck's going on here?
[12226.31s -> 12242.58s]  Okay, yeah, that makes sense. He's just talking to himself at this point.
[12255.66s -> 12258.54s]  I'm just like, manically talking to myself.
[12258.54s -> 12262.70s]  It's personal personal payback for you betraying us. What the fuck is wrong with you?
[12274.95s -> 12279.35s]  Special mobile armor units have been put six feet under town, Marshal.
[12280.15s -> 12285.11s]  Feel to be an old west hero. I want to hear the claps, please.
[12286.41s -> 12294.54s]  Not too good. I'm not the hero type. I'm just doing my job as president.
[12299.90s -> 12325.10s]  I'm good on the chaos. Not much else. The precariously positioned Arizona resistance
[12325.10s -> 12330.70s]  base had come under heavy fire from the two three trio of ultra mobile to armored suits.
[12330.70s -> 12335.66s]  But when the dust settled the fires the resistance still burning. However, let us never forget the
[12335.66s -> 12340.94s]  noble souls who perished under the name under the sun in President Wilson's name. But as we all know,
[12340.94s -> 12345.26s]  the government has since built a road that stretches as far from the desert of Phoenix
[12345.26s -> 12349.50s]  all the way to the East Coast, the Michael Wilson Highway straight as an arrow and serves as a
[12349.50s -> 12354.30s]  reminder to keep our country on the path of righteousness and never become lost again.
[12355.58s -> 12358.46s]  Jody, what's the situation on the ground across America?
[12359.82s -> 12369.82s]  In the west, areas where the army is pulling out are on the nation. The situation isn't so good.
[12370.86s -> 12378.42s]  Don't worry. I'll free the whole land soon enough. Any email from the resistance?
[12379.86s -> 12383.14s]  Yes, sir. The man's voice is as cool as ever.
[12387.62s -> 12392.04s]  Wolf, thank you. Our membership is steadily
[12392.04s -> 12395.88s]  more reliable. Trustworthy sympathizers have joined our fight to revolt.
[12399.27s -> 12404.87s]  The day will come soon. When we're ready to rise up, I'll be sure and let you know.
[12404.87s -> 12411.53s]  Anything but tear lists. The resistance leader sure. I'm playing this for like another 30 minutes.
[12412.41s -> 12417.80s]  Tough as nails. I was going to stop after about 30, 40 more minutes. So that sounds fun.
[12417.80s -> 12429.98s]  Now I'll head out to liberate the west. I think I'm going to get a major boss fight here. That's why
[12430.62s -> 12434.94s]  I want to wait. The enemy forces strengthening their suppression of Beverly. While the number
[12434.94s -> 12440.22s]  of soldiers equipped with heavy firearms is great, if you pay higher attention to their attacks,
[12440.22s -> 12448.22s]  there are no threat to your mobile articles in this battle theater are violent. Consider the
[12448.22s -> 12453.50s]  advantages and disadvantages and the geographical features as you destroy all the target areas in
[12453.50s -> 12458.46s]  the town. It's been an hour and a heart stone joke. 30 minutes actually. This mission goes by the
[12458.46s -> 12474.81s]  call name to fashion back to the street. It's a weird name for a little art. Invest in
[12476.94s -> 12487.24s]  probably another, a better assault rifle. I like the assault rifles. The SB and missile launchers.
[12487.24s -> 12502.36s]  I can't, I'm not going to look for it. What should I do? Probably save the money.
[12503.32s -> 12512.54s]  All right. If I buy this, I won't be able to afford the new, uh, no, go back into that one.
[12512.54s -> 12527.72s]  Let me see. Try to do two of these assault rifles. If I stun rounds, that doesn't sound very good.
[12527.72s -> 12533.16s]  Stun rounds. What's that good against? 80 damage, 200 capacity. This thing's terrible. What does it
[12533.16s -> 12544.76s]  do? Try to buy one of these. That's a lot of money. Non-legal. Does non-legal mean anything?
[12545.72s -> 12565.93s]  It doesn't sound like I want that. What is this FIFA 08 music? I don't know. You tell me.
[12570.89s -> 12576.30s]  You guys, it's, I can't even, I can't even right now. You guys are too much.
[12577.58s -> 12587.38s]  You guys are too much for me to handle right now. I like this. All right. Get it together. I can,
[12587.38s -> 12597.58s]  I'm fine. I want the big one. You always want at least, you want two different types of each hand.
[12597.90s -> 12603.58s]  That's fine. Double ham, but I'm going to replace this with a different missile launcher here.
[12606.66s -> 12614.63s]  Yeah, this one here is fine. All right. Looks good. Let's go. Boss time.
[12619.26s -> 12623.26s]  Enemy explosive devices are planted all over the city of Beverly Hills.
[12624.22s -> 12631.40s]  Destroy all the bombs and liberate the town. Can you tell the Kim shits the bed story again?
[12632.36s -> 12638.62s]  Just go rewind like an hour and a half. This is DNN's Peter McDonald reporting.
[12639.18s -> 12643.58s]  What you're looking at is the heinous terrorist metal wolf as seen from the air.
[12644.62s -> 12650.94s]  Just what will become of Beverly Hills and its stately mansions with a street smell of money.
[12650.94s -> 12658.84s]  Stay tuned as this camera and I bring you all the news you want to know. Not him again.
[12659.64s -> 12667.24s]  Embed that journalist in the ground. Forget him and keep your mind on the mission, Mr. President.
[12667.88s -> 12671.72s]  This is a reverse meltdown. Bombs have been laid out all over town.
[12671.72s -> 12678.76s]  Reverse meltdown is like, I can't handle it right now. All right. Let's try this missile.
[12679.56s -> 12685.05s]  I like it. That's a lot of damage. Takes a long time to reload. Let's go.
[12685.69s -> 12687.14s]  I love this thing.
[12691.62s -> 12692.34s]  That's a lot of people.
[12709.98s -> 12714.14s]  That's good damage. I'm going to keep my eye out for other ships.
[12714.14s -> 12714.86s]  Oh, okay.
[12714.86s -> 12719.90s]  The metal wolf has annihilated the troops and plans to capture Beverly Hills.
[12719.90s -> 12724.54s]  His end game must be money. This could be the world's biggest heist.
[12724.54s -> 12729.24s]  It was Norton. It could be.
[12732.10s -> 12737.62s]  If approached carelessly, it will detonate. Destroy it from a safe distance.
[12740.09s -> 12748.07s]  Safe distance. Where is it? It's right there.
[12748.07s -> 12750.71s]  Some scientists were among the POWs you rescued.
[12750.71s -> 12753.51s]  They were used to develop new weapons for the military.
[12754.15s -> 12757.19s]  Oh, that takes that. Okay. That's some huge. All right. Whatever.
[12758.63s -> 12765.48s]  Missiles. I'm on missiles. Bad.
[12770.01s -> 12774.41s]  Oh, this looks promising. The pride of the U.S. military.
[12774.41s -> 12776.65s]  Blackhawks raise their ugly heads.
[12778.17s -> 12781.26s]  Are they shooting? Let's go. Hurry up. Get out of here.
[12793.11s -> 12798.34s]  Bomb? It's driving into me. What are you talking about?
[12809.56s -> 12813.06s]  Closer. Come on. Get in there.
[12834.06s -> 12834.94s]  Another bomb behind.
[12837.99s -> 12839.53s]  Don't get too close.
[12843.22s -> 12847.70s]  I wonder if the vice president wants to go as far as to control the music in America.
[12851.78s -> 12861.66s]  That would be odd. How many bombs are there? Two more? Three more?
[12869.99s -> 12885.30s]  Good. Good work. Good.
[12887.22s -> 12889.96s]  Oh, but how many bullets left in that thing?
[12891.16s -> 12901.43s]  Is it going to explode? Nice work, President Jerva.
[12901.43s -> 12916.76s]  Can I shoot through that? I couldn't even have done that if I tried.
[12917.56s -> 12919.32s]  Dude, I did it again. How is that possible?
[12929.77s -> 12936.44s]  What the fuck is happening? Go. I don't know why it's doing that.
[12948.74s -> 12964.47s]  Bomb. I'll get it. Is this a bomb? Got it.
[12964.47s -> 12969.34s]  Any more? I don't think there's many more.
[12969.34s -> 12973.54s]  Oh, I guess I'm in fourth. Is that enough? No, it's on SG.
[12979.34s -> 12996.44s]  Oh, check this one out. Bingo.
[12997.56s -> 13013.46s]  Oh, good. YouTuber and streamer 101.
[13014.42s -> 13018.26s]  I'm looking for something to do, per se, when you don't have anything to say at all.
[13018.26s -> 13022.10s]  And you're just playing a game? Use short, quick adjectives.
[13023.30s -> 13030.36s]  Like, you got it. Bingo. Take on that one. Nice.
[13036.76s -> 13040.90s]  Huge. Get smoked.
[13048.39s -> 13054.55s]  Whatever they are. Advert.
[13057.29s -> 13061.36s]  Cute.
[13078.30s -> 13080.78s]  Don't worry about his yammering commentary.
[13082.22s -> 13087.72s]  See? Listen to her. Don't listen to my yammering commentary.
[13087.72s -> 13091.16s]  Just listen to my one line that I say every three minutes.
[13092.84s -> 13099.61s]  All right. Is that not it? What more shit to do?
[13100.49s -> 13108.71s]  What are the bombs that I'm not destroying? Cute.
[13120.01s -> 13123.45s]  M? Oh, damn. Okay. I gotta go this way.
[13134.54s -> 13138.38s]  Shit. I'm gonna be thinking about that now. Got it. Boom.
[13139.10s -> 13150.84s]  Fuck. It's that I'm concentrating and, like, I have nothing to say because I'm concentrating.
[13150.84s -> 13154.79s]  International superstar. Money, money, money, money.
[13154.79s -> 13159.27s]  What business does Metal Wolf have with a 3.2 billion dollar man?
[13159.27s -> 13164.17s]  Maybe he's going to take out a loan. Oh, man, he's destroying the mansion.
[13164.17s -> 13167.93s]  Add destruction of personal property to the breaking and entering charges.
[13167.93s -> 13172.65s]  The U.S. Constitution is downright powerless against Metal Wolf's evil.
[13195.94s -> 13198.90s]  Get that radar gun, please. It's messing up my game.
[13203.61s -> 13205.91s]  Watch it.
[13211.51s -> 13212.55s]  Why did that not happen?
[13215.50s -> 13225.37s]  What planet are you from? Wait, are those?
[13226.09s -> 13226.81s]  Yes, they were.
[13229.51s -> 13237.77s]  Oops. It's okay. I thought it was a bomb. I thought it was a bomb.
[13237.77s -> 13245.14s]  It was, but I didn't, you know, I just messed up. Sometimes you mess up. It's okay.
[13249.24s -> 13255.37s]  Metal Wolf has control of the entire town. Any further reporting is too dangerous.
[13255.37s -> 13260.57s]  Our news team is seeking refuge, but our coverage of these events will continue
[13261.21s -> 13266.57s]  because, yes, the pen is still mighty. I hate this thing. Get this fucking like

[13526.25s -> 13534.25s]  richard hawke piloting a special heavy mobile armor unit he annihilated the evil
[13535.53s -> 13543.24s]  occurring at the same time from a confidential covert operation we have also learned that
[13543.24s -> 13549.96s]  underground terrorists and metal wolf sympathizers in hiding were captured
[13549.96s -> 13557.58s]  in succession all around the country although martial law will continue until we are sure that
[13557.58s -> 13565.82s]  your safety can be completely secured for today and today only let's celebrate this victory
[13568.34s -> 13572.10s]  this has been an announcement from the government policy promotion department
[13572.10s -> 13579.51s]  your freedom
[13581.19s -> 13585.59s]  wasn't even me i already know i can see this i already know what happened they put a guy in a
[13585.59s -> 13593.93s]  suit just like a an actor and just pretended to beat him up and that's right what's the special
[13593.93s -> 13602.63s]  effects don't even beat a hollywood b movie richard's up to his old tricks again mr president a
[13602.71s -> 13611.05s]  special intelligence group this from the anti-coup data forces has ceased actually
[13611.77s -> 13620.50s]  we've lost contact with the resistance leader too we have it appears all the resistance activities
[13620.50s -> 13631.14s]  have gone south jodie those that died are imposters i am still here so believe in your own justice
[13631.14s -> 13635.38s]  did she not think that she was talking to me i won't lose to that false prophet
[13636.42s -> 13642.26s]  and the reason is because i'm the president of the united states of america
[13643.46s -> 13650.98s]  mr president there's no time for self-pity jodie get me up to speed on the situation in the east
[13652.50s -> 13657.03s]  oh my god waging war against more than just the resistance the american people too came
[13657.11s -> 13661.83s]  fire hawk called it the citizen citizen reeducation program this friend revolved
[13661.83s -> 13665.59s]  private property to a government-controlled rationing system your citizens were trafficked
[13665.59s -> 13669.83s]  overseas where he uses lab rats and weapons testing that's probably ridiculous the week and
[13669.83s -> 13673.03s]  i'm with her we're trampled down soon all of america and its bedrooms were paved over by
[13673.03s -> 13680.98s]  thick oppressive asphalt tyranny it was hawks eugenic wet dream and an unprecedented constitutional
[13680.98s -> 13684.82s]  crisis what else is the next chapter president wilson's saga as he continued to rise up against
[13684.82s -> 13700.92s]  his former running mate's injustices let's go this is new york my houston chicago let's check
[13700.92s -> 13706.84s]  out chicago the enemy force has concentrated strength in the center of chicago intelligence's
[13706.84s -> 13711.88s]  most educated guess is that the purpose is to re-educate the citizens and strengthen their
[13711.88s -> 13717.56s]  support for the vice president though there are many target areas it is possible to annihilate
[13718.12s -> 13722.92s]  by effectively using the train to move from building to building jump on the train destroy
[13722.92s -> 13728.76s]  the target areas and let the citizens wake up to their town with its tranquil this mission goes by
[13728.76s -> 13738.14s]  the call name not for much longer this is probably the last mission i wanted to do at least the whole
[13738.14s -> 13742.78s]  west coast president because i was thinking maybe we'd see like somewhere like other than phoenix
[13742.78s -> 13751.93s]  you know maybe we get some like nevada somewhere i don't know like area 51 or something right i'm
[13751.93s -> 13760.18s]  sure that would be like making sense in this game with me sorry uh i do want to do like one more
[13760.18s -> 13775.37s]  though i want the best of the best which is not gonna have to look i want another tier of assault
[13775.37s -> 13791.53s]  rifle sg-552 lr i want another one there it is i got level six assault rifles let's check that
[13791.53s -> 13803.77s]  up let's see sg-52sb that's the stun one an advanced assault rifle with outstanding range 175
[13803.77s -> 13814.41s]  versus 170 pretty good then there's uh energy rounds that's pretty good 1800 capacity here's
[13814.41s -> 13819.69s]  the big one a supreme assault record with incredible range and firepower i don't quite
[13819.69s -> 13828.15s]  have enough to buy this but i'm gonna get the energy one all right so i'm gonna do one more
[13828.15s -> 13834.01s]  after this one what one more after this there is there is a dangerous level it's later on in the
[13834.01s -> 13847.58s]  game well we'll see how far we get so two more so three more so four more i'm actually gonna keep
[13847.58s -> 13858.87s]  that on but we're going to remove this and put on that new stuff let's move right here
[13859.75s -> 13892.78s]  yeah and get this on there too ham ham good so this is good save it enemy forces occupy chicago
[13892.78s -> 13897.34s]  just beat the game i don't know i think this is a lot longer than that target areas and liberate

[13912.20s -> 13919.72s]  well if it isn't the heinous terrorist public enemy number one richard oh you've done excellent

[14158.14s -> 14164.78s]  gas in the city has already exceeded 50 parts per million metal wolf is a villain down to his last
[14164.78s -> 14181.96s]  mecha bolt well these guys hurt so don't get up to 200 300 parts per million

[14723.00s -> 14729.96s]  started up their poison gas control if the density of the poison gas exceeds 181 parts per million
[14729.96s -> 14736.76s]  human death is guaranteed destroy the target areas before the density reaches 181 what's that
[14741.21s -> 14744.41s]  don't let down your guard hurry up mr president
[14746.97s -> 14760.30s]  oh god never say that again i'm gonna turn voice off in such an obvious place

[15496.95s -> 15499.83s]  that's a pretty good car drop sound effect
[15511.24s -> 15522.73s]  all right let's go what are those those must be some new kinds of weapons mines they're being
[15522.73s -> 15528.65s]  dropped one after another from the elijah one metal wolf will have no choice but to deal with
[15528.65s -> 15554.17s]  this firepower swap to our next group i got you sniper unit and the pride of the elite
[15554.17s -> 15561.77s]  power troopers snipers this is a scene of biblical proportions a modern day
[15561.77s -> 15566.41s]  david and goliath okay mr president well you know what happens like doesn't david win
[15569.37s -> 15572.25s]  david wins he throws a rock at the giant's face and hits him right the skull
[15574.73s -> 15588.82s]  right by reducing the strong attack that device seems to have improved the guidance
[15588.82s -> 15601.27s]  function performance of the Bible Bible spoilers all right sure
[15604.15s -> 15637.88s]  all right that does look pretty elite these things gotta go
[15638.52s -> 15649.22s]  oh
[15658.98s -> 15668.54s]  you get down here then you see what i'm dealing with i'm fighting everybody by myself i don't have
[15668.54s -> 15701.62s]  any help not as well all right all right that's it right just gotta go for him now i don't think so
[15701.62s -> 15718.04s]  so maybe i can ah what i guess i could it did take damage
[15731.77s -> 15741.16s]  it's getting a little bit closer i wonder these breach
[15744.60s -> 15763.43s]  let's get the sand i'm just gonna hang up back here is that not reaching why are these not
[15763.43s -> 15791.16s]  reaching what is trying to escape from the base
[15804.89s -> 15835.00s]  they got to kill these things just gotta do it um i guess maybe it has to lock on
[15838.04s -> 15848.01s]  let me try to clear these out these little like crabs you'll get close when there's no more left
[15848.97s -> 15912.65s]  going forward or backward it's apparently something behind over here i guess i have to
[15912.65s -> 15931.26s]  destroy this thing of course i was doing damage last radar and comes in in the way that you
[15931.26s -> 15944.68s]  destroyed his radars this is the only other target on the map
[15945.64s -> 15948.39s]  so
[15950.87s -> 15959.32s]  take a look at that all right the u.s ground forces have been totally decimated by the hand of metal
[15959.32s -> 15969.51s]  wolf but we still have the speed ace up our sleeve that trump card being the super assault heavy
[15969.51s -> 15974.55s]  attack elijah one helicopter that's the guy that announces that it's his turn
[15975.67s -> 15980.71s]  it's my turn he just that's the name of his attack rushes in and he goes like yeah
[15982.07s -> 15994.95s]  and then gets fucking knocked out of the air like you go like dash forward dead
[15996.87s -> 16002.47s]  that happens in every single cartoon doesn't matter if it's japanese anime or not
[16002.47s -> 16019.46s]  they could be an american anime cover and let's end the mission right now
[16021.88s -> 16026.44s]  the elijah one fuselage has been damaged the elijah one i don't know why it is great but
[16026.44s -> 16033.16s]  giving up is not in the u.s military's vocabulary and the reason is the super attack elijah one
[16033.16s -> 16039.08s]  helicopter is still in action how about destroying the launch me doors mr president first start by
[16039.08s -> 16047.53s]  reducing the strong attack how about i just kill it why didn't i just see elijah one's armor plating
[16047.53s -> 16055.53s]  has taken an awful beating the dreaded metal wolf fights like a demon on a rampage what's this
[16056.89s -> 16071.85s]  the super assault elijah one helicopter this aerial fortress has been destroyed by one single foe
[16071.85s -> 16080.01s]  dressed in mobile attack armor but i will never give up hope and hope will never yield to violence
[16080.57s -> 16089.13s]  i believe in american justice and my journalistic convictions because yes the pen is still mightier
[16089.13s -> 16099.91s]  than the sword this has been peter mcdonald for dnn hey mr journalist take a good long look i

[16259.85s -> 16266.36s]  this thing is ridiculous incredibly long range and firepower fires rebounding lasers
[16267.74s -> 16270.30s]  and i saw it with the longest range of any standard arms weapon
[16271.18s -> 16289.06s]  and i saw it used by cyborgs yes cyborgs i'm bought that's the first thing i'm buying i just
[16289.14s -> 16291.86s]  got this one how much is it to upgrade this one more time

[16534.70s -> 16549.08s]  been destroyed all right what am i looking at here i'm thinking to him what's the weak point here
[16549.88s -> 16562.76s]  i just i gotta get stuck in the way please do not be caught off guard
[16563.80s -> 16573.06s]  i didn't even hurt it and this is barely hurting this go up to the radar knock down that tower

[17137.30s -> 17150.68s]  the game but it seems probably a few more no no no no no not investment this one here enrf cb
[17152.60s -> 17160.63s]  got it might as well get one of the other ones too longest range rebounding lasers
[17161.51s -> 17169.34s]  we're gonna do longest range this one i don't think i have enough i don't have enough rare
[17169.34s -> 17182.76s]  metal for that although i can do missiles one more time right yeah let's do it p is available

[17191.56s -> 17201.38s]  pretty good i might get that but in the meantime let me put on that new thing that i got it's fine
[17202.66s -> 17208.38s]  uh i'm gonna replace this with that looks kind of cool

[17411.14s -> 17415.98s]  armor energy the origin of the energy supply should be cut off mr president
[17422.17s -> 17434.86s]  so you can weaken its electromagnetic armor that's what i'm doing judy i already see it
[17458.79s -> 17461.03s]  where is that spider thing right now oh god

[17564.30s -> 17571.98s]  i'm right under him oh my god what has to go for a recharge is that what
[17571.98s -> 17577.72s]  he's doing we're gonna charge his battery the energy station is a priority
[17587.75s -> 17596.98s]  fuck i thought i could do it i had an opportunity i thought i was gonna take it
[17597.78s -> 17604.42s]  if i had that thing i thought i had that um the super charge thing and it's so aggravating i
[17604.42s -> 17610.42s]  thought i had it what he said is true i was gonna be dangerous run away for now mr president
[17611.22s -> 17618.10s]  oh it sucks that daddy long legs get this energy wave fire power from a power facility
[17618.10s -> 17639.64s]  each target area of these powerful electro magnoi should be cut off first is that rocket number like
[17639.64s -> 17658.02s]  15 it's like that's rocket like number fucking 30 is it my shooting up air gas or i don't understand
[17684.49s -> 17687.61s]  way ahead of us to research weapons of mass destruction
[17689.93s -> 17698.12s]  okay i gotta run

[17804.92s -> 17810.50s]  the guy was down the street if what he said is true
[17811.06s -> 17826.89s]  this will be dangerous run away you have to go so fast and then you've run out of fucking boost
[17826.89s -> 17860.41s]  you just sit there overheated i should be cut out first here he is i'm gonna get i gotta get out of
[17860.41s -> 17896.55s]  here straight ahead i had the target a second ago i didn't even move i'm so disappointed i didn't
[17896.55s -> 17921.13s]  even move from the spot and i lost if i don't beat this game the u.s is finished after i do new
[17921.13s -> 17952.82s]  york we'll see get away from to recharge i guess it makes sense i'm gonna avoid this dickhead
[17953.86s -> 17986.36s]  he's not just gonna turn the corner and be here right he's walking which way is he walking

[20888.79s -> 20897.06s]  six point four right now oh and michael i forgot to tell you but
[20897.06s -> 20906.82s]  what your presidential staff those backstabbing idiots well i've decided they can die too
[20908.66s -> 20916.81s]  this game is a five seven oh my god you guys are fucking you guys don't push me right now i'm i'm
[20916.81s -> 20927.48s]  very very fragile right now i'm very sensitive at the moment and watch those worms wiggle in
[20927.64s -> 20931.78s]  vain i'll cry you'll watch you'll see me cry
[20934.57s -> 20952.17s]  see you when i see you all right here we go liberty island i'll head to liberty island to
[20952.17s -> 20964.68s]  rescue my men and the reason is because i'm the president of this great united states of america
[20965.40s -> 20977.51s]  yeah what's up with dashes all right well now let me get in here i think i want to do
[20978.31s -> 20997.05s]  i didn't do grand lunches at all what a waste of money what a meltdown purchase these were uh
[20997.05s -> 21014.25s]  i'm thinking i'm just gonna go straight up mr launcher i think i'm gonna do it rail gun let
[21014.25s -> 21021.35s]  me get this let me i want to get down one more tier here is the real gun that good let's see
[21022.23s -> 21037.10s]  rg-30 actually getting sp how much do they cost rg-50 okay let's go look at it
[21038.78s -> 21046.46s]  rg-30 firepower increases the charge a rail gun that could be charged for different projectiles
[21046.46s -> 21051.10s]  and then an advanced rail gun that can be charged up to for increased firepower i don't have any
[21051.10s -> 21061.38s]  metal i can make this one but this is the default one i don't have to end game late game here it's
[21061.38s -> 21077.27s]  probably that idea i'll do i'm gonna go get not do another level get some more money what
[21077.27s -> 21088.95s]  did i make the most money that was the easiest level i'll be down here miami what's a good grind
[21088.95s -> 21098.86s]  level that boat right yeah i ain't going to i'm not doing new york the enemy force sends out over
[21098.86s -> 21113.58s]  one thousand is this the one good luck all right i got this would be fine just to do it for money
[21113.66s -> 21121.77s]  anyways skipping the lower we already saw it the navy cruiser will fire powerful
[21141.45s -> 21154.52s]  all right boat i'm just looking for like two three hundred grand
[21155.16s -> 21162.58s]  musician was among the pows you rescued he was surely forced to play the ukulele on the beach
[21163.54s -> 21204.14s]  oh watch out for aerial attacks just behind them that's all
[21206.38s -> 21223.48s]  i'm back here uh to grind the money because i want to have the better stuff lots of money
[21237.51s -> 21244.23s]  offensive augment those poor soldiers more long-range missiles these attacks will rage
[21244.23s -> 21248.07s]  on unless you wipe out the launch course yeah i got it
[21254.71s -> 21255.51s]  oh really
[21260.39s -> 21290.73s]  evasive maneuver that was heavy you ammo let's get it i'm gonna die on the grind level and that's
[21290.73s -> 21295.02s]  where you say the time for a sandwich
[21332.47s -> 21341.50s]  people get sandwiches if they feel like making a sandwich in their own damn house in my house
[21342.14s -> 21345.58s]  i'm gonna make a sandwich if i want one that doesn't matter if you want to lose
[21346.30s -> 21349.90s]  you don't lose the baseball game and then you uh no can i have a sandwich no
[21352.18s -> 21387.30s]  you didn't hit two home runs today you get nothing the team lost this is where i gotta be careful
[21391.77s -> 21399.30s]  as far as my title makes no fucking sense anymore does it i haven't had like a
[21399.30s -> 21403.30s]  stupid thing strange thing i haven't done i'm trying to get close enough to do this
[21404.82s -> 21421.64s]  that out no way don't you dare oh man i can't fucking believe it
[21423.13s -> 21429.90s]  oh it's the guy he instantly died
[21431.82s -> 21441.22s]  it's time for a sandwich i was trying to make money just get over here
[21446.63s -> 21454.63s]  it seems to have received a request from the target area and is on their way
[21454.63s -> 21459.67s]  yeah i'm sure they have you should sever the reinforcements ahead of time
[21460.39s -> 21473.18s]  so
[21474.86s -> 21553.16s]  in fact if i don't do it this time i'm just going to play free unless you wipe out the launch
[21553.16s -> 21592.54s]  source i thought i got rid of those four soldiers
[21611.69s -> 21614.65s]  yeah they're just little fucking toilet seat covers
[21617.21s -> 21628.49s]  that's far enough metal going head to head with this kind of firepower
[21628.49s -> 21631.77s]  isn't a smart way start by crushing the gun battery
[21634.17s -> 21651.16s]  excited i wouldn't be not yet until i show that we're gonna do something crazy
[21656.89s -> 21681.10s]  the thing i started at one o'clock all right get done bombing this guy actually sucks
[21681.10s -> 21697.18s]  all right i don't know but this was this wasn't even easy this was annoying i can't even
[21699.66s -> 21706.86s]  70 mr president please put up a good fight you didn't come here to go swimming this is
[21706.86s -> 21728.46s]  hitting no day i don't think it is mr president you don't want to get stun locked and die do it
[21738.34s -> 21741.37s]  i believe this is still spinning around
[21742.97s -> 21789.62s]  welcome three gun battery tickers one through five are flooded repair crew get on the scene
[21790.18s -> 21818.57s]  do not withdraw fire sailors abandon your post escape all right where do i do that
[21818.57s -> 21831.59s]  i'll head to liberty island to rescue my men and the reason is because we already saw this
[21832.47s -> 21838.15s]  all right develop what investment manufacturer where do i do that um it said i could do it right
[21839.35s -> 21848.34s]  said oh you have enough to upgrade your suit but where do you do that
[21849.30s -> 21877.98s]  is it equipment it already did it automatically did it maybe i don't know that's weird all right
[21877.98s -> 21893.80s]  let's make that a real gun rg-50 should i make the next one good no no no no no i want to do
[21894.76s -> 21917.90s]  i'll do missile punches again m i m 204 i see it a supreme missile launcher that fires four missiles
[21917.90s -> 21927.78s]  at once 120 000 and all right let's just try this is one of this is one of the last levels
[21927.78s -> 21936.26s]  in the game we're just gonna go through it put it on what's this what one of these is a piece
[21936.26s -> 21952.17s]  of crap i think it's this one yeah this thing sucks now it takes up two slots lose my sam what's
[21952.17s -> 21961.93s]  better visit the sand this thing kind of sucks too huh these both aren't really good what's worse
[21962.49s -> 21978.57s]  over this no this is worse let's keep it i got the rail gun let's see what it does
[21982.84s -> 21995.50s]  washington dc mr president why did you come to save us after we betrayed you jodie
[21997.02s -> 22004.63s]  i can't turn my back on a friend and the reason is i'm the president of the united states
[22004.63s -> 22017.03s]  mr president don't come near it's a trap hey there michael are you still playing the hero
[22018.15s -> 22027.37s]  witcher you just don't get it do you drop this thing like three or four times freedom is dead
[22028.09s -> 22033.77s]  you and your men and this symbol of freedom
[22041.74s -> 22050.68s]  okay that way we protect the statue go ahead and cock your weapons if i direct these missiles
[22050.68s -> 22059.16s]  behind me that goddess of liberty and you're gonna get a secretary will all be blown to smithereens
[22059.16s -> 22068.10s]  i'm gonna stop the missiles don't stop stop shooting i have to get up there and protect the
[22068.90s -> 22077.67s]  it's already dead uh you're definitely missing something here
[22080.46s -> 22097.70s]  what is it to shoot him out of the sky damn it i thought that i would have been great if i could
[22097.70s -> 22107.14s]  just kill him i'm gonna kill them i gotta shoot the missiles let's do it again
[22107.14s -> 22120.25s]  um
[22129.13s -> 22134.33s]  right but should we should be standing somewhere else so i just sit here and just shoot him when
[22134.33s -> 22143.11s]  they come out i guess i really should get the uh the thing that can take it out
[22143.99s -> 22156.71s]  that interceptor one whatever it is it's kind of what it should be
[22157.67s -> 22186.06s]  they go all the way back let me see what happens when i like go is this just like a dps race
[22186.62s -> 22192.34s]  do i actually have to shoot all these out of the sky why am i not getting a good lock on
[22214.01s -> 22221.85s]  two i didn't i wasn't even really in wow is on the move michael he'll bite you if you don't move it
[22221.85s -> 22225.21s]  it now i tail it out of here
[22227.37s -> 22233.29s]  my car door is open i'm sorry i almost forgot time for my afternoon tea
[22234.57s -> 22241.13s]  nothing like sipping some delicious darjeeling tea and watching you getting your clock cleaned
[22241.13s -> 22251.05s]  all right we'll see you next mission whoa that just kind of started um same deal
[22251.05s -> 22259.56s]  oh he's just bombarding this thing what the fuck what are you supposed to do about this
[22259.56s -> 22275.27s]  just keep i guess um what's the best weapon for this dude patches not just a badge railgun
[22275.27s -> 22285.35s]  mr preston charges you're alive us resistance soldiers are known for our resilience
[22286.07s -> 22290.18s]  uh
[22301.14s -> 22303.06s]  i can't just stand here with this railgun
[22305.69s -> 22317.06s]  we have knowledge of how to escape i we're good helicopters are limited be careful
[22318.18s -> 22326.84s]  i can just i mean you move too slow with this thing to shoot like the missile
[22326.92s -> 22328.28s]  yeah this is way too slow
[22335.86s -> 22339.08s]  i'm gonna use the rail gun you walk away
[22348.50s -> 22352.18s]  all right let's go
[22353.14s -> 22363.02s]  and cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me that goddess of liberty and your cute
[22363.02s -> 22371.75s]  little secretary will all be blown to smithereens give me another do i have i need to get two assault
[22371.75s -> 22378.22s]  rifles for this i think unfortunately yeah that's probably a better idea i should go back to the
[22378.22s -> 22387.35s]  garage because this is not no you just need to even be a self rifle so much easier
[22388.55s -> 22411.16s]  use the rail gun now it's too slow too slow i can't no the rail guns are not good here
[22411.80s -> 22419.38s]  too slow he's gonna just keep firing missiles with the statue of liberty charge it the whole
[22419.38s -> 22436.70s]  way just shoot it at the tank okay do you want me to just do this like 10 times
[22436.70s -> 22452.49s]  is it actually gonna work no this is not gonna work too much damage to the statue of liberty
[22452.49s -> 22479.26s]  already i'm like i'm saying this is not gonna work i'm gonna get run over by this tank
[22480.94s -> 22483.72s]  the damage rate is over 50 watch out
[22484.36s -> 22488.26s]  oh
[22497.82s -> 22504.06s]  part one yeah maybe i could see that part two all right maybe i hold on maybe it is part two
[22504.06s -> 22526.65s]  maybe okay hold on this might actually work why'd you have to die and cock your weapons
[22526.73s -> 22533.93s]  if i direct these missiles behind me that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary
[22533.93s -> 22536.65s]  will all be blown to smithereens
[22546.98s -> 22563.77s]  wow how much do i have to load it up is it like 10 20 more than that 50 all right
[22563.77s -> 22570.15s]  when it flashes yellow the first time i'll get it next time restart restart restart restart
[22573.26s -> 22584.87s]  go ahead and cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me that was it that god
[22584.87s -> 22591.35s]  is the liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens
[22596.44s -> 22613.16s]  he's making me so angry yeah i don't think this is very effective i have to hold it for too long
[22613.16s -> 22617.88s]  it takes too long i'm gonna i might get to the end but i don't think it's gonna work out very well
[22619.24s -> 22624.86s]  he has no more missiles can i take off the top ones too let's see if i can get these ones too
[22626.06s -> 22630.17s]  am i just making him completely useless before phase two
[22633.74s -> 22662.42s]  uh what is this last one oh i'm over here the game is broken just kill him can i do it in time
[22664.17s -> 22668.41s]  how many bullets how many will he shoot how much damage is one missile due to the statue of liberty
[22669.05s -> 22678.07s]  too much no he's gonna go phase two oh fuck oh my god i should have just listened to myself
[22678.63s -> 22686.94s]  i should have just shot it i should have just done it that'll work out though as long as i
[22687.66s -> 22709.62s]  this might not be bad no i know i know we're fine i know you're gonna keep saying it
[22710.82s -> 22732.76s]  the trade is over 50 watch out in 200 yards between the tank and the statue of liberty
[22732.76s -> 22739.24s]  kill promptly and effectively that's an ironclad battle tactic does that mean he's gonna get me
[22739.24s -> 22747.54s]  okay look back at the trade is over 70 percent we're down stop doing cut scenes to tell me that
[22747.54s -> 22769.03s]  somebody died because it takes away all my charge kill with cool super i don't have
[22775.11s -> 22785.77s]  mr president why'd you have to die all right i got a new i'm gonna have to do double assault
[22785.77s -> 22792.09s]  rifle i'll try this one final time because i think if i get it the right way the way that i want
[22792.09s -> 22798.81s]  cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me three that god is of liberty and your
[22798.81s -> 22803.05s]  cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens
[22816.90s -> 22822.12s]  all right take out the missiles up here i'm gonna stick with that strategy i think it's gonna work
[22822.76s -> 22837.93s]  take out all the guns that i can and then i'm gonna get off the rail gun and go to assault rifle and
[22838.01s -> 22839.85s]  something else maybe i don't know i'm not sure yet
[22845.21s -> 22849.56s]  saw rifle and missile launcher i guess i'm gonna have to rail gun out
[22852.81s -> 22860.01s]  do full charge right in the middle okay here comes space two
[22864.58s -> 22878.44s]  of course behind a small wooden railing how about defenses great just take the damn thing out
[22878.44s -> 22897.29s]  okay maybe the sand here we go oh i don't think this is working
[22898.89s -> 22905.98s]  uh it's actually somehow less effective than just using the open
[22918.42s -> 22929.69s]  that's an iron clad battle tactic make it stop damage rate is over 50 i don't even see i don't
[22930.89s -> 22946.41s]  think it's over 70 oh my god i'm gonna have a meltdown again i don't think that's doing anything
[22948.49s -> 22953.59s]  the thing in the middle has to die and effectively that's an iron clad battle tactic
[22966.65s -> 22970.17s]  i'm shooting the legs right now damage level is approaching critical mass
[22971.13s -> 22993.98s]  danger mr president why'd you have to die uh i don't understand what to do
[22995.90s -> 22998.70s]  yeah i was doing much better with the rail gun just put the rail gun back on okay
[22998.70s -> 23005.98s]  i kind of want a better rail gun go ahead and cock your weapons direct these missiles behind me
[23005.98s -> 23013.10s]  that god is of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens
[23033.74s -> 23050.49s]  simple oh is it what how is this simple he's got like 30 rocket launchers i want this thing
[23050.49s -> 23054.41s]  gone but i don't think you can can you not get rid of it i'm just gonna fully charge
[23054.41s -> 23060.06s]  shot right in space is it destroyed it looks like it is but it might not be
[23061.02s -> 23068.98s]  was it gone before i remember there's so much stuff going on on the screen it's hard to tell
[23069.94s -> 23088.94s]  these things almost dead they're sitting there experimenting for too long oh all right yeah it is
[23089.02s -> 23097.56s]  we did we're not we'll see
[23110.81s -> 23115.93s]  stop oh my god it's the worst why would you go into two cutscenes and grow
[23115.93s -> 23138.63s]  fuck why is there ever a reason to do that it is over 50 watch out only 200 yards between the
[23138.63s -> 23144.92s]  tank and the statue of liberty kill promptly and effectively that's an ironclad battle tactic i
[23144.92s -> 23166.76s]  guess that did it it's going slower now it's over 70 we're down to five helicopter sure you
[23166.76s -> 23172.57s]  could have just said that i could have just told you that i don't want to see the cuts
[23186.81s -> 23202.81s]  i got no more danger oh just die how do i get this i gotta get rid of this thing
[23202.81s -> 23212.15s]  in a hurry kill with cool composure that's an ironclad battle tactic this thing's like a
[23212.15s -> 23224.30s]  shield or do i just have to destroy this i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead it's over i'm
[23224.30s -> 23245.37s]  dead it's over i'm dead it's crushing everybody it's killing me mr president honey how did how
[23245.37s -> 23253.83s]  could i fall um so he pushed me all the way back all right do it again i got it same deal
[23257.51s -> 23264.87s]  that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens
[23267.08s -> 23283.10s]  laugh i want to fucking strangle this guy so bad i'm here from our all hey man welcome to the stream
[23284.36s -> 23297.32s]  we if i have fun here don't be too crazy though get yourself in trouble right down the middle
[23301.26s -> 23310.74s]  back launcher i'll get it come on guns right there get this one too
[23333.11s -> 23340.23s]  all right rail gun back out again come on got real gun oh fuck he's coming fast all right go
[23340.23s -> 23351.32s]  treads one two three got it other tread quick one two three got it okay here we go
[23353.16s -> 23362.31s]  back cannons cutscene double cutscene double cutscene shoot it before the cutscene
[23364.10s -> 23388.20s]  wins the next cutscene coming up right now right it's right it's soon lid hit the lid hit the lip
[23389.08s -> 23407.13s]  rate is over 50 watch out good now what now what just shoot it just kill it
[23412.81s -> 23424.17s]  more treads fully charged fully charged to the tread oh shit only 200 yards between the
[23424.17s -> 23445.67s]  tank and the statue of liberty i got four more shots did that hit that fucking car
[23448.87s -> 23457.03s]  be careful no why come on i can still do it he can't hit any other particle he'll be out of
[23459.26s -> 23471.77s]  kill a cornered enemy that's an ironclad battle tactic is that hurting him i can't even tell what's
[23471.77s -> 23484.30s]  hurting him anymore okay okay okay okay now what this damage level is approaching critical mass
[23485.34s -> 23492.14s]  danger 50 yards till target okay kill it okay okay kill it shooting mr president
[23492.94s -> 23498.18s]  there's many a slip between the cup and the lip what does that even mean
[23499.14s -> 23517.37s]  why is he going so fast what the fuck what happened why what why did he go so fast
[23519.10s -> 23524.12s]  that makes no sense he went so fast
[23533.43s -> 23543.16s]  that was ridiculous that was ridiculous un-fucking-believable no i gotta retry it
[23543.16s -> 23552.89s]  again why what that was so unfair that was unfair i can't believe it i had it too i got it
[23565.96s -> 23571.72s]  it isn't rage time grind out some better real guns all right all right yeah i'm gonna go pee
[23572.60s -> 23585.46s]  and then we'll do that god damn it that's unbelievable so i would be angry right now
[23585.46s -> 23598.62s]  but how can you be after that you kind of can't be i want to just get rid of all this shit for the
[23598.62s -> 23621.69s]  next phase if it doesn't have anything to shoot then it doesn't matter i would break the disc
[23621.69s -> 23635.37s]  and shit on it oh really i don't i want to just completely focus on getting rid of the trends
[23636.17s -> 23643.61s]  he's not gonna have any more guns the middle one's already gone i got it okay here we go
[23645.53s -> 23657.70s]  full blast into the thread one two three good again one three four got it okay slow down he's
[23657.70s -> 23662.10s]  done i did it right is that did i do it he looks like he's going faster okay there we go
[23662.74s -> 23678.54s]  okay good focus my god what have you done that didn't blow it up
[23678.94s -> 23692.97s]  you don't want to do it twice because it's a waste
[23694.97s -> 23712.30s]  this one might be a wash this is it how are you shitting me that thing is should be dead
[23712.30s -> 23739.80s]  without a doubt all right bring it up good next one here we go we're down five helicopters between
[23739.80s -> 23745.88s]  the tank and the statue of liberty kill promptly and effectively hold it longer look at the bar
[23745.88s -> 23775.53s]  fills up it's full first fall first fall two more last shot and then it's all hell breaks loose
[23776.41s -> 23782.82s]  all hell breaks loose after this one and then what i just rocket launcher rockets
[23785.80s -> 23791.45s]  but kill a cornered enemy with prudence that's an iron cloud battle tactic
[23792.98s -> 23806.50s]  stop rifles not doing anything lock it on lock it on target lock on lock on lock on lock on lock on
[23806.50s -> 23816.01s]  lock on lock on lock on lock on lock on lock on lock on i don't have any i don't have any mother
[23816.65s -> 23830.71s]  fuck off who cares nice shooting mr president but there's many assume your mecha damage rate
[23830.71s -> 23857.58s]  is over 50 watch out here he comes no mr president i got it mr president no no no
[23858.68s -> 23863.32s]  i can do it i can everyone it's gonna be fine we're gonna beat this game and i'm gonna it's
[23863.32s -> 23869.18s]  it's worth it what are you what do you keep doing wrong oh i think i'm just i don't have a hot i'm
[23869.18s -> 23880.65s]  strong enough like i i'm everything i'm this is fine i'm everything's good don't worry get rid of
[23880.65s -> 23888.65s]  the shitty stuff yeah what i need to i think i'm gonna get i want another i want i'm gonna grind
[23889.29s -> 23897.21s]  this is i'm gonna get like three of these i think all right i have two of those don't i i do okay
[23897.21s -> 23904.12s]  so that's just this is end game this is the end game here this shit is worthless what does
[23904.12s -> 23915.59s]  the most damage that's a full-on flamethrower maybe it might flamethrower maybe it's worth the
[23915.59s -> 23931.03s]  shot i should buy another one of these will the flamethrower not damage it what do you think
[23931.03s -> 23948.87s]  what do you think i think and uh sam is still all right i guess we'll do missile launcher and
[23949.83s -> 23958.98s]  this is good i think it's terrible we'll do these two and spam them all right i'm gonna try this one
[23958.98s -> 23969.35s]  more time with the new loadout same as intended for aircraft yeah but i just have hams should i
[23969.35s -> 23977.90s]  just use the other this this bazooka the bu kind of terrible the hams do more than 600 damage
[23980.89s -> 23988.87s]  they do this actually is better than that this does 18 okay we're good let's try this again i'm
[23988.87s -> 23993.27s]  going for it this time i'm going to change up the tactic a little bit i'm not going to use the rail
[23993.27s -> 24007.00s]  gun immediately i'm going to use go ahead and no i have to i have to so much more precise behind me
[24007.00s -> 24014.44s]  that god is a liberty and your little secretary will all be blown to smithereens i restarted i
[24014.44s -> 24020.44s]  fucked it i blew it i can i just gotta get up i gotta get it just one you see what i mean by this
[24021.32s -> 24027.80s]  here we go it's got you have to get them each in one shot
[24027.80s -> 24035.24s]  i direct these missiles behind me that god is of liberty and your cute little secretary will all
[24035.24s -> 24050.04s]  be blown to smithereens okay that's i missed but it's all right that's sponge bob that's not
[24050.04s -> 24065.13s]  pitch it's pitch shifted down sponge bob's lap i have to restart here we go
[24065.13s -> 24072.17s]  go ahead and cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me that god is of liberty and
[24072.17s -> 24076.89s]  your cute little secretary here we go all be blown to smithereens
[24084.06s -> 24098.17s]  sponge bob all right we're going good so far i just have to get them each in one individual shot
[24102.92s -> 24106.20s]  there it is same with these ones same right in the front door
[24106.84s -> 24110.20s]  that your liberty is going to be fine forget about the hp
[24110.20s -> 24117.48s]  just worry about the mechanics involved in here done aim up a little bit make sure it's fully
[24117.48s -> 24133.40s]  charged it takes two to get rid of these you know this you know this here we go okay cool
[24134.04s -> 24176.15s]  just making sure that i get it okay good treads treads and then guns okay good guns good stop
[24176.87s -> 24200.98s]  gonna do it again don't screw me over like this please i'll have like i'll have like 12 shots do
[24200.98s -> 24216.50s]  this good good this is it i'm gonna shoot that thing i'm gonna shoot the i'm gonna shoot the
[24216.50s -> 24223.32s]  stupid overpass thank you for getting rid of that here we go bingo this is it fully charged only
[24223.32s -> 24232.20s]  the same thing happened to me last time i got stuck by the car we're down to oh you mother
[24232.20s -> 24247.88s]  fucker why did you do that it's okay i still have funny shots only 200
[24249.00s -> 24285.72s]  and i've got that entire i got the two uh qrs's on the taxi was tiny it's not that small stop
[24285.72s -> 24313.06s]  laughing at that seven shots oh no this is too slow i got two qrs's 50 yards here we go
[24313.06s -> 24334.54s]  but don't be in a hurry kill come on no how did i do less damage than the last time
[24335.50s -> 24344.41s]  he's shooting mr president here we go but there's many a slip between the cup and the lip
[24344.41s -> 24375.45s]  get it oh fuck he's dead one more shoot it i lost i should have stuck with the plan
[24375.45s -> 24380.49s]  i should have stuck with the plan all right i should have stuck with the plan
[24384.94s -> 24388.42s]  new tactic
[24392.92s -> 24399.88s]  if i direct these missiles behind me that god is a liberty and your cute little secretary
[24417.82s -> 24426.52s]  better tactic it's better what a better tactic this really is now i got enough energy supplies
[24427.32s -> 24440.71s]  and now i have more and i'm just gonna stick to the fucking plan i will have like 20 shots
[24441.51s -> 24455.19s]  is this thing destroyed it is now oh fuck oh that's not good okay this is very bad actually this is
[24455.19s -> 24469.35s]  horrible worst plan confirmed he's already on the move yeah he's already moving this is worse
[24470.55s -> 24497.62s]  this is way worse wait is the statue what statue liberties can take that's great i think the
[24497.62s -> 24538.30s]  statue liberty is fine going straight in the middle so yeah forget about the top missiles and
[24538.30s -> 24544.62s]  shit i can i think i can do it right now damage rate is over 50 watch out he just put up a shield
[24544.62s -> 24550.70s]  for me that's fine i'll take it only 200 yards between the tank and 200 yards though man you're
[24550.70s -> 24578.42s]  already here and effectively that's an ironclad battle tactic stick i can stick to the plan i have
[24578.42s -> 24585.19s]  a hundred meters
[24612.49s -> 24617.29s]  i just need to shoot it like five times i'm already how am i so close to
[24617.29s -> 24625.58s]  being dead that's an ironclad battle tactic does he have thorns just restarted oh my god
[24626.14s -> 24634.49s]  mr president let us down i keep taking missiles i have to walk to shoot the okay i got it
[24637.08s -> 24645.03s]  same thing just gonna do old plan old plan only old plan the same thing i did before and i have to
[24645.03s -> 24652.87s]  do it quick this time missiles do too much damage they're too annoying
[24652.87s -> 24656.39s]  clean it up
[24659.78s -> 24669.72s]  i couldn't i try i have i can't take my hand off the controller i was trying to do a thing where
[24669.72s -> 24682.50s]  you put your finger up to your throat and you shake it around wasted you got beyond i'm beyond
[24682.50s -> 24696.86s]  angry at that that's two shots it didn't take it down get rid of the rest of the missiles that
[24697.10s -> 24704.92s]  is almost dead it's not just that's what is almost dead the thing i still hit something
[24724.42s -> 24726.42s]  it is almost dead am i not gonna do this
[24732.04s -> 24742.97s]  this is my last attempt before i go grind another how did i why was it already over
[24746.01s -> 24750.41s]  go ahead and cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me
[24750.41s -> 24757.77s]  that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens
[24758.81s -> 24762.84s]  uh

[27679.02s -> 27691.00s]  gonna keep doing it right down the middle oh fuck that does too much damage maybe it doesn't
[27691.00s -> 27702.52s]  matter maybe it doesn't matter maybe i can still do it too much damage i'm gonna have to use the
[27702.52s -> 27711.48s]  second okay now i take i can hold on we're good wait hold on a second i might have to get the
[27711.48s -> 27720.22s]  whole back row here this is never going to work with this low slow charge i need to get rid of
[27720.22s -> 27729.11s]  all this stuff first yeah no way this is impossible without getting rid of everything
[27729.11s -> 27753.43s]  first damage rate is over 50 watch out yeah we're gonna do the original rail gun in phase one
[27754.39s -> 27766.55s]  this one in phase two go ahead and cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me
[27766.55s -> 27773.91s]  that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens
[27774.15s -> 27780.44s]  oh
[27784.47s -> 27788.79s]  i don't understand like that was seriously why would you take that much that would that that
[27788.79s -> 27811.83s]  that's un-fucking-believing i'm just gonna stand up here can i jump on the tank i'm not sure i
[27811.83s -> 27834.39s]  want to do that oh boy i may have done something wrong what the fuck happened why did he start
[27834.39s -> 27842.38s]  moving why did he start moving it's like i don't know is it the amount of damage you do
[27843.26s -> 27851.06s]  fuck this go ahead and cock your weapons check this out these missiles behind me that god is
[27851.06s -> 27857.62s]  a liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens what if i just don't care
[27857.62s -> 27867.67s]  and just shoot the tank and just who cares will he kill the statue of liberty in time i don't know
[27867.67s -> 27891.48s]  maybe i'm gonna try to take on this whole back row they went i'm trying to split them
[27892.20s -> 27913.43s]  that's your liberty's dead oh my goodness i'm gonna lose my damn mind playing this thing i mean i
[27913.43s -> 27921.06s]  already did but like holy shit maybe i should just start to maybe i should just try to catch
[27922.66s -> 27933.32s]  you try this go ahead and cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me that god is a
[27933.32s -> 27939.48s]  liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens
[27942.54s -> 27964.28s]  all right all right hold on right down the middle get rid of the beam okay now the hold on i did
[27964.28s -> 27989.72s]  that really quickly i might have some time here fuck that was a genuine fuck that was a genuine
[27989.80s -> 28004.98s]  like heads like sneeze forward fuck my head went back forward hard okay i'm good
[28008.62s -> 28026.41s]  not bad it might this might work switch out to the big one after hold on this is it right here
[28027.21s -> 28039.06s]  i can get both you stupid motherfucking cutscene why does that have to even happen oh my god this
[28039.06s -> 28054.68s]  game is gonna drive me fucking up the wall this is this is just this is just you can't say this is
[28054.68s -> 28071.35s]  not done with a capital d it's just dumb how does a fucking almost full charge shot take that up
[28071.35s -> 28084.22s]  not take that up there's no explanation this is worse this gun is worse i spent the time grinding
[28084.22s -> 28089.56s]  to get this and it's not even as good i just popped my elbow that's how you know it's real
[28090.36s -> 28106.65s]  that was a good start too that's so sad i'm gonna have to do this again i'm
[28106.65s -> 28111.93s]  only i'm just gonna use the original weapons if i direct these missiles behind me that
[28111.93s -> 28118.73s]  goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens
[28156.28s -> 28171.32s]  i'm back to these original one machine guns i'm gonna go for the top okay i got i gotta get rid
[28171.32s -> 28180.84s]  of these things the tread has to go now like right now watch out watch out please don't shoot
[28180.84s -> 28213.91s]  it that's the cutscene i got it okay let's go oh you gotta be fucking kidding me which rate is
[28213.91s -> 28234.30s]  over 50 watch out i'm just going for the tank i'm just going for it that's a lot that is a lot
[28234.30s -> 28243.51s]  just so we're clear that's a ton of fucking damage only 200 yards between the tank and the
[28243.51s -> 28249.35s]  statue of liberty and effectively that's an ironclad battle tactic
[28272.42s -> 28292.02s]  mr president let us down um i wonder if i should just get your weapons if i direct these missiles
[28292.02s -> 28299.30s]  behind me that god is a shit ain't working and your cute little secretary will all be blown to
[28299.30s -> 28317.42s]  smithereens maybe i should hold on to this and use this for the missiles i'm doing that yeah i'm
[28317.42s -> 28338.76s]  gonna try that just buy a bunch of the missile launcher i think i could probably take out the
[28338.76s -> 28348.66s]  ones in the back quickly with that other launcher it's possible let's go with the cannon in the
[28348.66s -> 28359.64s]  middle all right let's try to get the machine gun here and then i try to get the missiles back
[28360.60s -> 28370.86s]  waiting up i mean the treads first treads first treads are more important
[28374.06s -> 28402.09s]  i just didn't even do the thing i said i was gonna do lost my fucking mind i i don't think
[28402.09s -> 28406.17s]  this is physically possible for me to beat this without different weapons without getting the
[28406.17s -> 28415.48s]  perfect storm i think i have to grind this shit ain't working go ahead and cock your weapons
[28415.48s -> 28422.68s]  if i direct these missiles behind me that god is of liberty and your cute little secretary
[28422.68s -> 28444.58s]  will all be blown to smithereens i can stand back further to blow this up
[28444.58s -> 28458.57s]  so
[28459.85s -> 28477.10s]  did i get i don't know if i got it i think i got it is it going faster i can't tell
[28493.56s -> 28508.57s]  amateur rate is over 50% i know i know it is i know it is i can't
[28511.29s -> 28531.50s]  i'm gonna try that again all right no no no no i don't know what to do
[28531.50s -> 28545.86s]  i think i think i just kind of have to go ahead and stay up there and shoot the missiles
[28545.86s -> 28551.86s]  missiles behind me that god is a liberty and i was so close with the rail gun and rockets
[28551.86s -> 28557.22s]  yeah it's so hard to replicate though just so fucking you gotta be it's not even being perfect
[28557.22s -> 28575.16s]  is you just have to be in it's like the timings are weird i had it almost twice but then for some
[28575.16s -> 28580.52s]  reason with no treads this game decides that it's going to go 100 miles per hour with the last like
[28580.52s -> 28592.20s]  20 meters for no reason this is just it's just gonna do it but i don't know why once we get the
[28592.20s -> 28596.60s]  cutscenes i think i have to change because it's just ruining everything it's ruining everything
[28596.60s -> 28614.26s]  that's your liberty zone today and that didn't have three rail guns that you've been done three
[28614.26s -> 28619.22s]  hits direct three fucking direct hit with like almost halfway charging it's inconsistent what
[28619.22s -> 28649.67s]  the fuck what is that what else do i have here i can't use this because this gets cutscene so
[28649.67s -> 28656.90s]  it's just not gonna work they give you a cutscene every single time somebody gets hurt so i guess
[28656.90s -> 28680.36s]  we're gonna go with we're gonna get rid of this and the bazookas sam maybe double bazooka i want
[28680.76s -> 28690.89s]  should be sam bazooka i don't i don't i think all right let's try this now
[28692.17s -> 28702.26s]  i'm just gonna check the other ones this i can't even how much damage does this do
[28704.57s -> 28718.70s]  missiles and bazooka are the key i guess i'm gonna do the sam and just these two
[28718.70s -> 28731.32s]  let's see which ones are more effective i guess i'll keep the rail gun just for shit i'm just
[28731.32s -> 28736.89s]  trying to try to target everything i guess just target them individually keep the rail gun for
[28736.89s -> 28754.36s]  maybe the end i'll try it i don't have these don't work on
[28784.71s -> 28791.75s]  why was i using the other thing why was i using the rail guns why was i using the rail gun
[28792.71s -> 28800.97s]  oh why was i doing that i don't know people told me didn't people tell me to do that
[28802.81s -> 28809.24s]  weren't people telling me people telling me right people telling me to do that was it two people
[28809.24s -> 28823.35s]  it was not two people it was like six thousand you guys told me to go back and grind for the rail gun
[28824.70s -> 28841.88s]  tears are streaming down my face it was a it was a shitload of people that was a lot of people

[28847.48s -> 28851.96s]  i just killed that thing so easily just by using bazooka
[28856.54s -> 28860.14s]  i apologize for saying use rail gun i don't know anything about the game

[29297.75s -> 29304.68s]  white house all right so uh we are there looks like there's a lot more video game here
[29305.82s -> 29312.87s]  retake the white house i don't think so maybe not but first i am going to do that again
[29313.75s -> 29320.09s]  which was it was this one here i'll head to liberty and because
[29321.61s -> 29335.69s]  just go i'm gonna do this like two three times go ahead and cock your weapons if i direct these
[29335.77s -> 29342.17s]  missiles behind me that god is a liberty and your cute little secretary will
[29344.17s -> 29379.26s]  oh don't fast still take out the treads please thanks first that's an iron clad yes yes yes
[29381.26s -> 29400.28s]  shooting mr president but there's holy shit s okay that's fucking all right do it again
[29400.52s -> 29408.30s]  okay i know i know look after seeing me do this now
[29410.38s -> 29414.30s]  imagine being a vod watcher and then seeing the last hour and a half
[29414.94s -> 29426.10s]  and knowing that you could skip to that supposed to be watching the vod right now
[29427.64s -> 29431.40s]  just i'm sorry i'm sorry that you had to watch that for like 40 straight minutes
[29431.40s -> 29439.80s]  i direct these missiles behind me that god is like there's like 2,700 people like 400 people told
[29439.80s -> 29444.76s]  me to use the rail gun and to like grind to get the rail gun so i listened it was it was it was
[29444.76s -> 29451.72s]  like four or five hundred people a lot of people and i thought that you were giving me tactical
[29451.72s -> 29475.00s]  information the caterpillar things first that's an iron clad battle tactic or i was just pretending
[29475.00s -> 29482.55s]  the whole time use what you're shooting mr president but that's so bad knowing that how
[29482.55s -> 29487.67s]  how easy this level is can you imagine not even not only forget about the people that are watching
[29487.67s -> 29491.59s]  the vod right now can you imagine the people who are watching the stream right now who have
[29491.59s -> 29497.27s]  played through this game and know that and were lost in the sea of get railgun and they know how
[29497.27s -> 29502.94s]  easy this was
[29525.13s -> 29533.29s]  i'm absolutely happy to have it mostly 95% of it be this game what a journey it's been it's been
[29533.29s -> 29540.65s]  fucking wild you've heard me say like fuck you've heard me say like shit you've heard me go
[29540.65s -> 29545.45s]  it's just ridiculous this game is fucking crazy you've heard that a few times we've got a few
[29545.45s -> 29567.46s]  things here nice shooting mr president but there's many a slip between the cup and the lip
[29580.10s -> 29587.40s]  what's happening wait this is oh yeah no i won first i thought it was all right we went
[29588.12s -> 29598.57s]  it's like what happened there all right that's it i got plenty of money it's time to get the enemy
[29598.57s -> 29603.21s]  seems to be the best rail gun no i don't want to skip this shit we don't know what this is
[29603.85s -> 29612.49s]  the enemy seems to be concentrating their power around the white rub defense forces predicted to
[29612.49s -> 29618.49s]  be on hand the shape of this underground base is highly complicated there is a strong possibility
[29618.49s -> 29623.77s]  that the target area is closely coordinated skillfully attacked to prevent reinforcements
[29623.77s -> 29630.09s]  and coordination between target areas this is the grand daddy grand daddy battle of the mall
[29630.09s -> 29636.09s]  annihilate the target areas and take half the white house by the call name the call name take
[29636.09s -> 29648.01s]  the white house i'm home generation white house good luck and god fucking god damn it all right
[29648.01s -> 29660.30s]  here we go investment level six visual launcher i want it boom m i m 204 lr is now available
[29661.66s -> 29679.14s]  that was a long horn missile launcher seven the m l r h is now available for purchase oh yeah
[29679.14s -> 29691.70s]  rail guns get it the r g 50 dmv is now available keep going the r g 70 is now available
[29693.83s -> 29707.30s]  the r g r h is now available bazookas get this shit too i'll just blow the tank up two more times

[29721.30s -> 29746.82s]  i'll head to end because i didn't cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me
[29746.82s -> 29750.84s]  that god is a liberty and you're cute little second
[29752.44s -> 29758.07s]  oh just like silent i'm gonna how long have you been here
[29759.03s -> 29768.71s]  really bad was this a melt downstream this was even though it was it's been a while when was
[29768.71s -> 29786.95s]  the last like true just absolutely fucking yes vr stuntman iceland right but before that
[29788.71s -> 29791.99s]  it's like been three days there's many a slip between the company
[29793.99s -> 29800.07s]  i gotta like settle down the mountain blade stream the difference between mountain blade though is i
[29800.07s -> 29811.19s]  straight up gave up and i didn't even attempt to keep going i'll do one more time that should get
[29811.19s -> 29828.68s]  us to where we want to be because hotline miami i thought hotline miami was truly actual upset
[29828.68s -> 29835.80s]  like truly angry truly upset and that's one of the first times i think i've ever really truly been
[29835.88s -> 29842.44s]  upset on the camera actually today too and like skate three and arizona no i have whatever
[29843.74s -> 29851.88s]  mario maker yeah no no you're right mario maker 2 that did not do i regret playing hotline miami
[29851.88s -> 29856.12s]  no i think it's great here hotline miami 2 is awesome and hotline miami i think hotline miami
[29856.12s -> 29860.34s]  is better than hotline miami 2 i think it's just a better game overall i will be out of
[29870.09s -> 29873.93s]  tower i i think clock tower was more of a complete complete just total
[29874.65s -> 29875.53s]  termination screen
[29879.61s -> 29893.37s]  you didn't like the coin game i thought i'd love that all right let's buy things that i just
[29893.37s -> 29899.13s]  upgraded good luck the coin game was awesome that's like one of my favorite games of the year
[29901.56s -> 29908.98s]  what's it's clock tower all right i think i can do one more
[29908.98s -> 29920.57s]  row here rail guns all the way up bazookas all the way pr is here and the final bazooka
[29921.45s -> 29940.60s]  the t w b z r h let's see what that does right wait what how is another one the vps go to bazooka
[29940.60s -> 29950.73s]  double-barreled and capable of repeating fire uh yeah i'll take one of those what about the
[29950.73s -> 29956.76s]  rail gun missile launches what's the best one here m l r h the vps go to missile electrophores
[29956.76s -> 29964.92s]  and missiles that split i don't have any more material well it's gonna have to be that bazooka
[29965.72s -> 29972.70s]  i need more material repeating fire rail gun i might as well make the other cheaper can i make
[29972.70s -> 29989.98s]  the cheaper ones no i can do this one rifter bombs i'll take it i might as well take no all
[29989.98s -> 30000.06s]  right no that's good that's good let's go back there it is and on the other side we'll do
[30001.18s -> 30015.24s]  yes i guess i could put that there uh i'll just put the other rail gun here
[30016.76s -> 30020.60s]  good to go it's the best uh missile launcher in the game in the whole game
[30032.49s -> 30057.19s]  final mission it's been a journey let's party it's good to be home
[30058.15s -> 30074.01s]  it is ridiculous i'm not even gonna use it and save it what's this uh what's the dump dude
[30075.51s -> 30081.59s]  the above ground route has been sealed off but if you take back the underground bay
[30081.59s -> 30090.58s]  the enemy will surrender and open the barrier now aim for the target areas got it now get out there
[30090.58s -> 30106.09s]  and rock their world what it just shoots a balloon it sucks i won't be using that
[30112.28s -> 30124.79s]  there's a bomb in here
[30133.03s -> 30142.14s]  let's try the dump one more time just get getting bigger and bigger and bigger and
[30142.14s -> 30150.01s]  bigger and bigger should i just launch it it's a giant beach ball that's not very
[30162.34s -> 30168.54s]  even a full charge it's not i can't it won't even get rid of one of these little towers
[30190.98s -> 30198.26s]  rare i don't like this uh loadout i need a machine gun or something
[30199.30s -> 30211.78s]  i'm like a not a big fan of this loadout sorry guys you know it's gonna make somebody mad
[30212.58s -> 30219.77s]  me go back and grind the tanks i'm not sure i'll need to
[30219.85s -> 30265.62s]  okay
[30325.62s -> 30330.31s]  right
[30343.91s -> 30348.97s]  Oh, I got it. All right, fine.
[30355.96s -> 30383.40s]  A lot of trees. Cold. Snowy.
[30383.40s -> 30394.01s]  I mean, I can French, so...
[30394.01s -> 30400.41s]  It's a really nice place.
[30400.41s -> 30402.41s]  I love, uh...
[30402.41s -> 30405.29s]  I miss, I miss Toronto.
[30405.29s -> 30409.96s]  Some good restaurants.
[30425.32s -> 30427.58s]  It's a good place.
[30427.58s -> 30432.59s]  There's a couple of great, there's like four or five really, really great barbecue places in Toronto.
[30432.59s -> 30444.19s]  It's like bar, if you like think like barbecue, that's a great place to go.
[30444.19s -> 30445.19s]  Game's too long.
[30445.19s -> 30448.35s]  Fixed it.
[30448.35s -> 30455.90s]  I said that, I said that, uh...
[30455.90s -> 30458.90s]  When you think barbecue, you really want to be there.
[30458.90s -> 30460.90s]  It's got some of the best barbecue places in the country.
[30460.90s -> 30468.14s]  I'm too quiet? What did I do?
[30468.14s -> 30483.56s]  All the way through here and then...
[30483.56s -> 30486.56s]  It's not too quiet, now it's... I've got it.
[30490.81s -> 30502.90s]  I gotta go in a different tunnel, I think.
[30502.90s -> 30518.71s]  Close. Oh, a bomb.
[30518.71s -> 30523.91s]  Why did I blow the other one up? Why would I do that? I don't understand.
[30524.91s -> 30538.72s]  Poutine? Oh, yeah.
[30538.72s -> 30540.72s]  For those who didn't know, I'm not from Canada.
[30540.72s -> 30544.72s]  Poutine is a dish, it's a french fries gravy.
[30544.72s -> 30545.72s]  And, um...
[30545.72s -> 30548.72s]  Sometimes it depends on what the certain restaurant...
[30548.72s -> 30550.72s]  My mother used to make it.
[30550.72s -> 30553.72s]  With gravy and little like kind of dollops of cheese, like chunks of cheese.
[30560.72s -> 30561.72s]  Oh, let me do this again.
[30561.72s -> 30563.72s]  I have to do this shit again.
[30577.37s -> 30579.37s]  Well, I have to do this now.
[30579.37s -> 30599.34s]  Destroy it!
[30623.62s -> 30626.18s]  I win. Did I actually do it?
[30627.18s -> 30629.99s]  They surrendered, why are they still attacking?
[30640.38s -> 30641.38s]  What's next?
[30660.14s -> 30662.14s]  Leave a level?
[30662.14s -> 30668.78s]  Secure a path.
[30668.78s -> 30681.54s]  Secure a path. Calm down, you just got a bomb.
[30681.54s -> 30683.54s]  You hear me right now? I'm doing just fine.
[30683.54s -> 30694.77s]  Right there, right there, right there, right there, right there.
[30712.52s -> 30721.53s]  Here?
[30721.53s -> 30726.01s]  How did I trip and explode?
[30726.01s -> 30728.01s]  Here's the final fight.
[30728.01s -> 30730.01s]  I don't want to blow this.
[30732.76s -> 30735.58s]  God damn it.
[30738.58s -> 30740.58s]  I have to do all that again if I lose.
[30740.58s -> 30742.58s]  And this is a bad loadout.
[30742.58s -> 30744.58s]  This is a terrible loadout.
[30748.58s -> 30751.46s]  I don't know what the hell I'm going to do about this.
[30752.46s -> 30756.46s]  Mr. President, the fuselage damage rate is above 50%.
[30756.46s -> 30760.46s]  Mr. President, the fuselage damage rate is over 70%.
[30760.46s -> 30764.46s]  A scaredy cat missile is being protected in a sturdy shelter.
[30764.46s -> 30768.46s]  When the shelter opens, that's your chance to win.
[30808.05s -> 30816.88s]  She's dead.
[30816.88s -> 30839.73s]  That didn't, I can't believe that didn't kill her.
[30839.73s -> 30844.21s]  What the fuck?
[30844.21s -> 30848.74s]  What?
[30848.74s -> 30850.74s]  Oh my god, what just hit me?
[30850.74s -> 30855.13s]  I need health or something right now.
[30855.13s -> 30866.46s]  Health, somewhere.
[30866.46s -> 30868.46s]  Shields, anything.
[30868.46s -> 30870.46s]  I don't want money.
[30870.46s -> 30872.76s]  There we go, thank you.
[30872.76s -> 30877.58s]  Bullshit.
[30877.58s -> 30894.10s]  Well, this gave me a good opportunity to get rid of literally the $800,000 beach ball ray gun.
[30894.10s -> 30898.47s]  That doesn't do anything.
[30898.47s -> 30915.14s]  I'm going to kill the tank like three more times.
[30915.14s -> 30921.58s]  Three more times.
[30954.83s -> 30964.05s]  I'm playing Diablo 3, you hear this?
[30987.46s -> 30994.12s]  Bastion sucks.
[30994.12s -> 30998.38s]  I'm leaning back in my chair.
[30998.38s -> 31001.44s]  I think that's enough, I think.
[31005.44s -> 31014.30s]  Manufacture bazookas.
[31014.30s -> 31019.82s]  So this is the thing that I currently own, right?
[31019.82s -> 31021.82s]  I still have no metal.
[31021.82s -> 31024.38s]  It sucks.
[31024.38s -> 31028.22s]  Rare metal required.
[31028.22s -> 31034.23s]  I'm going to piss my pants.
[31034.23s -> 31035.23s]  I've got to go pee.
[31035.23s -> 31036.23s]  I have to.
[31036.23s -> 31038.23s]  I'll be right back.
[31038.23s -> 31183.66s]  Usually when I come back from peeing, I'm like, I feel better.
[31183.66s -> 31187.02s]  What is this rare metal dog shit?
[31187.02s -> 31189.02s]  What is the point of this?
[31189.02s -> 31194.36s]  It's just money.
[31194.36s -> 31196.36s]  It's just like a number.
[31196.36s -> 31216.78s]  Alright, I am going to...
[31216.78s -> 31218.98s]  I don't know.
[31218.98s -> 31221.54s]  I need to think of something.
[31221.54s -> 31226.78s]  I bought everything I can buy.
[31226.78s -> 31227.78s]  Get the Gatling gun.
[31227.78s -> 31228.78s]  How far down?
[31228.78s -> 31229.78s]  Where is that?
[31229.78s -> 31247.81s]  934.
[31248.81s -> 31254.44s]  Well, I don't have enough to get it.
[31254.44s -> 31258.92s]  This is going to be a better loadout.
[31258.92s -> 31259.92s]  I'll try this again.
[31259.92s -> 31262.92s]  I'm only going to seriously give this another couple of attempts.
[31262.92s -> 31266.92s]  I can't stream for like 10, 11 hours.
[31266.92s -> 31268.54s]  I can't.
[31268.54s -> 31270.54s]  My brain will fucking melt.
[31270.54s -> 31272.54s]  I'm going to stick with this.
[31272.54s -> 31275.62s]  Get rid of this thing.
[31275.62s -> 31283.34s]  I need some assault rifles because...
[31283.34s -> 31286.22s]  Alright.
[31286.22s -> 31287.22s]  What are you doing?
[31287.22s -> 31348.11s]  What am I doing?
[31348.11s -> 31351.42s]  The game would not let me select this item.
[31351.42s -> 31355.42s]  It was glitching out and making it impossible to click.
[31355.42s -> 31357.42s]  So I had to do it manually with the keyboard.
[31357.42s -> 31373.89s]  I'm not sure this is going to be very effective here.
[31373.89s -> 31376.89s]  Maybe I'll just run around with the flame thrower and just hold it down.
[31376.89s -> 31378.89s]  This would be better.
[31378.89s -> 31384.30s]  I think this is alright.
[31384.30s -> 31386.99s]  Get the Gatling gun.
[31386.99s -> 31395.34s]  Manufacture.
[31395.34s -> 31403.12s]  The VP's go-to machine gun fires multiple powerful rounds.
[31403.12s -> 31410.39s]  I need $22,000 worth of metal.
[31410.39s -> 31413.39s]  Getting rid of the beach ball gun and two machine guns should help a lot.
[31413.39s -> 31415.39s]  I'm going to go for it.
[31415.39s -> 31417.08s]  Let's go.
[31417.08s -> 31418.08s]  I got to go.
[31418.08s -> 31420.08s]  I got to get out of here.
[31420.08s -> 31421.08s]  I'm streaming tomorrow.
[31421.08s -> 31423.08s]  Tomorrow is going to be an intense stream too.
[31423.08s -> 31426.08s]  So why the fuck am I streaming for 10 hours today?
[31426.08s -> 31428.08s]  Tomorrow is going to be all over the place.
[31428.08s -> 31448.42s]  I'll try to make this clear.
[31448.42s -> 31450.42s]  Yeah, we're going to start at the regular time tomorrow.
[31450.42s -> 31452.42s]  Probably closer to 4.
[31452.42s -> 31455.62s]  You forced yourself to beat this.
[31455.62s -> 31456.62s]  I know it.
[31456.62s -> 31468.20s]  I'm upset about it.
[31468.20s -> 31472.81s]  What is that guy doing?
[31472.81s -> 31474.81s]  At least he's like the car in the game.
[31474.81s -> 31476.81s]  Did he actually get in?
[31476.81s -> 31498.53s]  He got in.
[31498.53s -> 31512.14s]  Put on the regular machine gun.
[31512.14s -> 31514.14s]  I'll take this thing.
[31514.14s -> 31523.18s]  I should go this way.
[31523.18s -> 31524.18s]  We're doing jazz dance tomorrow?
[31524.18s -> 31528.18s]  No, we're doing you're in the movies.
[31528.18s -> 31537.83s]  The gas one.
[31537.83s -> 31562.22s]  Yes, it's me.
[31562.22s -> 31563.22s]  Speaking please.
[31563.22s -> 31572.18s]  Who is it?
[31572.18s -> 31573.18s]  Alright, that's it.
[31573.18s -> 31574.18s]  Now we go straight down.
[31574.18s -> 31579.74s]  I have to take out the helicopters.
[31579.74s -> 31582.82s]  Those are things that cause so many problems.
[31582.82s -> 31584.82s]  Why can I not lock on?
[31584.82s -> 31598.55s]  Alright, let's go.
[31598.55s -> 31607.49s]  I got to pick up some shields.
[31607.49s -> 31611.49s]  I'm going to need them so badly for the next part.
[31611.49s -> 31657.49s]  I need shields.
[31657.49s -> 31659.49s]  Please drop a shield for me.
[31659.49s -> 31661.49s]  For me.
[31661.49s -> 31677.79s]  Did I get one?
[31677.79s -> 31678.79s]  Shields.
[31678.79s -> 31689.42s]  This whole thing is black and yellow.
[31689.42s -> 31691.42s]  I don't even know if I'm still streaming.
[31691.42s -> 31695.32s]  Am I?
[31695.32s -> 31696.50s]  I am, right?
[31696.50s -> 31697.50s]  Yes.
[31697.50s -> 31718.17s]  To the left.
[31718.17s -> 31727.38s]  We're a pre-recorded chat.
[31727.38s -> 31729.82s]  At least you're here.
[31729.82s -> 31735.34s]  More bombs.
[31735.34s -> 31737.34s]  I can't detonate these on my own.
[31737.34s -> 31740.34s]  I guess I can, but you have to really do it precisely.
[31740.34s -> 31753.74s]  I remember this part.
[31753.74s -> 31757.56s]  It sucks.
[31757.56s -> 31766.65s]  You can't move carelessly until the radar jamming station is destroyed.
[31766.65s -> 31783.06s]  Can you marry me?
[31783.06s -> 31784.36s]  Nope.
[31784.36s -> 31800.13s]  Says you.
[31800.13s -> 31801.13s]  Whatever.
[31801.13s -> 31803.75s]  I think I'm doing a good job.
[31803.75s -> 31810.88s]  What?
[31810.88s -> 31813.25s]  What's the matter?
[31813.25s -> 31814.25s]  That's cold.
[31814.25s -> 31815.25s]  How is that cold?
[31815.25s -> 31833.94s]  Hopefully I was not downstairs.
[31833.94s -> 31844.11s]  I'm going to do it, guys.
[31844.11s -> 31846.18s]  I'm going to do it.
[31846.18s -> 31848.18s]  I'm going to do it this turn.
[31848.18s -> 31850.18s]  And there's going to be celebrations.
[31850.18s -> 31885.78s]  I would marry Jerma and then divorce him so I get half of what he gets every stream.
[31885.78s -> 31904.34s]  That's not...
[31904.34s -> 31906.34s]  And you guys are calling me cold.
[31906.34s -> 31914.00s]  Me cool.
[31914.00s -> 31915.00s]  All right, I'm good.
[31915.00s -> 31916.00s]  It's time.
[31916.00s -> 31917.00s]  I'm ready.
[31917.00s -> 31918.00s]  Let's get...
[31918.00s -> 31920.00s]  I got full health bar.
[31920.00s -> 31922.18s]  I'm going for...
[31922.18s -> 31924.18s]  What do you think?
[31924.18s -> 31925.18s]  Super launcher.
[31925.18s -> 31928.18s]  And just a standard...
[31928.18s -> 31929.18s]  Faithful here.
[31929.18s -> 31958.66s]  Are you guys still alive?
[31958.66s -> 31969.62s]  Arms.
[31969.62s -> 31975.28s]  Ammo.
[31975.28s -> 31976.28s]  Good.
[31976.28s -> 31977.28s]  Okay.
[31977.28s -> 31981.27s]  Here we go.
[31981.27s -> 31982.27s]  I got to get ready for this.
[31982.27s -> 31984.27s]  I need something that can lock on, though.
[31984.27s -> 31987.27s]  So I think I'm going to have to stick with this.
[31987.27s -> 31990.27s]  I need something to lock on to those helicopters.
[31993.75s -> 31994.75s]  This is it.
[31994.75s -> 31996.38s]  This is the one.
[31996.38s -> 31998.38s]  I am going to do it right here, right now.
[31998.38s -> 32000.38s]  It's time to...
[32000.38s -> 32002.38s]  It's time to...
[32021.46s -> 32038.37s]  We're good.
[32038.37s -> 32041.37s]  Let's get rid of all the bullshit ammo in the place over here.
[32042.61s -> 32093.21s]  We're halfway there.
[32094.21s -> 32100.10s]  Take the hand.
[32100.10s -> 32102.34s]  Make us win.
[32103.34s -> 32119.91s]  To boomer, I will divorce you.
[32122.91s -> 32123.91s]  Right?
[32123.91s -> 32133.46s]  What?
[32133.46s -> 32134.46s]  Was I not supposed to do this?
[32134.46s -> 32135.46s]  What happened?
[32135.46s -> 32136.46s]  Was I not supposed to do that?
[32136.46s -> 32137.46s]  What happened?
[32137.46s -> 32138.46s]  What happened?
[32138.46s -> 32139.46s]  What happened?
[32139.46s -> 32140.46s]  What happened?
[32140.46s -> 32141.46s]  What happened?
[32141.46s -> 32142.46s]  What happened?
[32142.46s -> 32143.46s]  What happened?
[32143.46s -> 32174.37s]  I destroyed the White House?
[32174.37s -> 32175.37s]  But why?
[32175.37s -> 32177.93s]  I can't shoot it.
[32177.93s -> 32178.93s]  I just...
[32178.93s -> 32180.93s]  I was doing fine.
[32180.93s -> 32183.10s]  I was doing fine there.
[32183.10s -> 32184.10s]  I really was.
[32184.10s -> 32185.10s]  I had to...
[32185.10s -> 32187.10s]  I can't hit the White House.
[32187.10s -> 32192.97s]  You can only destroy the armor.
[32192.97s -> 32201.38s]  Why do you think it had a health bar?
[32201.38s -> 32203.38s]  Because I thought I had to...
[32203.38s -> 32204.94s]  I don't know.
[32204.94s -> 32207.94s]  I didn't think I was going to kill the whole thing.
[32216.82s -> 32222.79s]  Fuck.
[32222.79s -> 32224.79s]  I was so close.
[32224.79s -> 32225.79s]  I didn't know that, though.
[32225.79s -> 32239.38s]  Hold on.
[32239.38s -> 32242.61s]  Hold on.
[32242.61s -> 32243.61s]  I'm going to do it.
[32243.61s -> 32244.61s]  I'll be fine.
[32255.38s -> 32257.38s]  In Canada, there was a saying growing up.
[32257.38s -> 32259.38s]  My mother, who's French.
[32259.38s -> 32262.58s]  I think you guys have it in English, too.
[32265.85s -> 32267.85s]  I think it's in English.
[32267.85s -> 32268.85s]  It's...
[32272.85s -> 32274.85s]  Which my mother told me that translated to,
[32274.85s -> 32277.85s]  if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
[32277.85s -> 32283.48s]  That's a little saying we have here in Canada.
[32312.44s -> 32314.44s]  I'm going to beat this.
[32314.44s -> 32315.44s]  I'm going to beat this.
[32315.44s -> 32318.44s]  And it's going to be the end of my channel.
[32318.44s -> 32321.44s]  Because after I beat it, I'm going to be so exhausted
[32321.44s -> 32322.44s]  that I'm going to scream.
[32322.44s -> 32324.44s]  They're going to have to take a real backseat.
[32330.61s -> 32333.17s]  I'm going to have to go to the spa after this.
[32333.17s -> 32334.17s]  I will beat this.
[32334.17s -> 32335.17s]  Can't beat this.
[32335.17s -> 32340.89s]  I will beat this.
[32340.89s -> 32343.06s]  We just crossed the 10-hour border.
[32343.06s -> 32344.06s]  I was going to give up.
[32344.06s -> 32345.06s]  Remember, I was, like, raging.
[32345.06s -> 32346.06s]  Like...
[32347.06s -> 32348.06s]  It was just like a five.
[32348.06s -> 32350.06s]  What did Ajin give this?
[32353.24s -> 32354.24s]  That's all.
[32354.24s -> 32355.24s]  That's all I heard.
[32355.24s -> 32356.24s]  Not anymore.
[32357.61s -> 32358.61s]  Turn him.
[32358.61s -> 32372.33s]  I'm going to...
[32372.33s -> 32383.23s]  Yeah, that's good.
[32383.23s -> 32385.23s]  It was three hours ago and you almost quit.
[32385.23s -> 32387.23s]  That's so bad.
[32389.94s -> 32390.94s]  That's so bad.
[32390.94s -> 32391.94s]  He's so bad.
[32391.94s -> 32393.94s]  He's so bad.
[32393.94s -> 32397.31s]  Has he even stomped one time?
[32400.13s -> 32401.13s]  Guys, I just can't...
[32401.13s -> 32402.13s]  Has he even stomped?
[32402.13s -> 32404.13s]  He's fucking bad.
[32405.13s -> 32416.61s]  Let's just keep going straight through.
[32417.61s -> 32426.02s]  All right, so if it was...
[32426.02s -> 32427.02s]  If we were, like, in a real-life scenario,
[32427.02s -> 32428.02s]  where, like, you know, you...
[32428.02s -> 32429.02s]  Oh, hey, welcome.
[32429.02s -> 32430.02s]  Come to the German 95.
[32430.02s -> 32432.02s]  Twitch, meet and greet.
[32433.02s -> 32434.02s]  And, like, I'm like, hey, what's up?
[32434.02s -> 32435.02s]  How are you?
[32435.02s -> 32437.02s]  And we were kind of waiting to say hello and show up.
[32437.02s -> 32440.02s]  And would you say, dude, you're fucking bad at games?
[32440.02s -> 32441.02s]  I don't think you would.
[32442.02s -> 32443.96s]  I think you'd be like...
[32453.22s -> 32459.62s]  I think you'd be like, oh, Jeremy.
[32459.62s -> 32460.62s]  It's such an honor to meet you.
[32461.62s -> 32480.82s]  Remember when you full cocked your head backwards
[32480.82s -> 32492.94s]  and fully catapulted down to your head
[32492.94s -> 32494.94s]  and pushed through your desk?
[32495.94s -> 32496.94s]  That was...
[32496.94s -> 32497.94s]  Wow, that was ridiculous.
[32497.94s -> 32498.94s]  I can't believe you actually could do that.
[32500.94s -> 32501.94s]  The desk went in the hand.
[32501.94s -> 32503.94s]  You didn't even need to use your hands.
[32532.49s -> 32534.30s]  86.
[32535.30s -> 32541.15s]  So when is the German meetup?
[32541.15s -> 32542.15s]  I'm not...
[32542.15s -> 32543.15s]  I'm not doing one on Twitch, please.
[32543.15s -> 32544.15s]  This is a bomb.
[32545.15s -> 32571.80s]  Wait up.
[32572.80s -> 32573.80s]  Find that meetup.
[32573.80s -> 32574.80s]  Go find Dr. Bob.
[32575.80s -> 32577.80s]  I'm gonna find Dr. Bob.
[32578.80s -> 32580.87s]  I'm sorry.
[32581.87s -> 32592.84s]  We may able...
[32592.84s -> 32593.84s]  We may be able to...
[32593.84s -> 32594.84s]  We may be able...
[32594.84s -> 32595.84s]  We may be able to...
[32599.27s -> 32601.60s]  Your income is over.
[32602.60s -> 32611.14s]  Oh, all right.
[32611.14s -> 32618.14s]  So don't destroy any...
[32618.14s -> 32619.14s]  Just do it now.
[32620.14s -> 32624.26s]  You know, like, why...
[32624.26s -> 32626.26s]  I'm not gonna use it on the actual White House.
[32627.26s -> 32628.26s]  Why don't you just do it now?
[32629.26s -> 32630.26s]  I can't use it on the White House.
[32631.26s -> 32632.26s]  I mean, you know...
[32636.26s -> 32637.26s]  Should I stop swearing?
[32637.26s -> 32638.26s]  My mother...
[32638.26s -> 32639.26s]  Actually, my mother told me recently.
[32641.26s -> 32642.26s]  She said, you should stop swearing.
[32643.26s -> 32644.26s]  I was like, yeah.
[32644.26s -> 32647.35s]  I was like, I've tried that before, mom.
[32648.35s -> 32651.68s]  She was like, it's not a good book for the former.
[32652.68s -> 32654.75s]  I was like, you know what?
[32654.75s -> 32655.75s]  You're up.
[32656.75s -> 32662.02s]  From now on.
[32664.02s -> 32668.70s]  Oh, no!
[32668.70s -> 32669.70s]  Oh, my...
[32669.70s -> 32670.70s]  Please.
[32670.70s -> 32671.70s]  Oh, my God.
[32671.70s -> 32672.70s]  Oh, my God.
[32672.70s -> 32673.70s]  What happened?
[32673.70s -> 32674.70s]  Why did I do that?
[32674.70s -> 32675.70s]  I tried...
[32675.70s -> 32676.70s]  I didn't have enough boost.
[32676.70s -> 32677.70s]  Oh, my God.
[32677.70s -> 32679.70s]  And I have two things left.
[32679.70s -> 32680.70s]  I can't fucking believe it.
[32681.70s -> 32682.70s]  I can't believe it.
[32682.70s -> 32685.70s]  I just want to get out of this stupid area.
[32686.70s -> 32687.70s]  Oh, my God.
[32687.70s -> 32688.70s]  I need to look for a shield.
[32688.70s -> 32689.70s]  I have to.
[32689.70s -> 32690.70s]  Otherwise, there's no way I'm going to do this.
[32699.09s -> 32700.09s]  Mine's in the hallway.
[32701.09s -> 32703.09s]  Sloppy goddamn hallway.
[32703.09s -> 32704.09s]  Look, mine's in it.
[32705.09s -> 32706.09s]  Just in case.
[32707.09s -> 32708.09s]  Let's just lay him down.
[32715.41s -> 32716.41s]  I can't believe it.
[32716.41s -> 32717.41s]  I had full health too.
[32717.41s -> 32720.41s]  Mine's do like two full bars.
[32720.41s -> 32721.41s]  Why would they...
[32721.41s -> 32723.41s]  Why would they do that much damage?
[32724.41s -> 32739.38s]  I got the offensive augment.
[32739.38s -> 32742.01s]  I'm so happy about this.
[32747.98s -> 32757.01s]  Ten hours, and I can't manage the boost.
[32757.01s -> 32759.01s]  Yeah, I've been sitting here for ten hours.
[32760.01s -> 32765.38s]  Albert Einstein, if he was sitting in the chair for ten hours playing this game, would not be able to do that.
[32766.38s -> 32780.48s]  Thanks for the warning.
[32787.48s -> 32795.99s]  Albert Einstein wouldn't even have my stim right now.
[32795.99s -> 32796.99s]  Are you serious?
[32797.99s -> 32801.88s]  He'd write like a few theories and then go to bed.
[32802.88s -> 32814.23s]  Oops.
[32814.23s -> 32815.23s]  No, no, whatever.
[32815.23s -> 32816.23s]  He's probably here.
[32817.23s -> 32826.41s]  Peace.
[32827.41s -> 32828.41s]  And I'm dead.
[32828.41s -> 32829.41s]  Somehow.
[32829.41s -> 32830.41s]  I got like sandwiched.
[32830.41s -> 32831.41s]  I thought these guys were dead.
[32834.35s -> 32835.35s]  We have to do this whole thing again.
[32836.35s -> 32842.20s]  Presidents.
[32842.20s -> 32848.45s]  That's going to be a Christmas miracle if I'm able to do this.
[32849.45s -> 32850.45s]  Look at my ammo.
[32850.45s -> 32871.95s]  All this shit going on in this next area.
[32872.95s -> 32875.78s]  Trouble.
[32875.78s -> 32877.78s]  What am I going to do here?
[32878.78s -> 32883.34s]  I have to stick to this.
[32883.34s -> 32884.34s]  The thing I was doing before.
[32884.34s -> 32887.34s]  Except this time don't like accidentally destroy the whole White House.
[32888.34s -> 32892.02s]  Like I did before.
[32892.02s -> 32893.02s]  Somehow.
[32893.02s -> 32894.02s]  I'm going to go actually look around for ammo.
[32901.63s -> 32902.63s]  This box is back here.
[32905.63s -> 32906.63s]  What are you fucking doing?
[32906.63s -> 32908.19s]  Okay, I found a couple.
[32909.19s -> 32910.19s]  I found two.
[32910.19s -> 32912.19s]  I'm going to actually go to the other side.
[32912.19s -> 32913.19s]  There's more boxes over here.
[32917.19s -> 32925.54s]  What was that?
[32925.54s -> 32927.35s]  Some help.
[32927.35s -> 32930.77s]  Got to get rid of the helicopters.
[32931.77s -> 32936.02s]  Oh, there's the tanks.
[32941.10s -> 32942.10s]  There's two tanks.
[32942.10s -> 32944.10s]  They just spawned in here.
[32945.10s -> 32950.92s]  Not destroy the White House.
[32958.24s -> 32959.24s]  I see a shield over there.
[32960.24s -> 32961.24s]  I see one.
[32961.24s -> 32964.14s]  Got it.
[32964.14s -> 32965.14s]  Okay.
[32965.14s -> 32966.14s]  Do just fine.
[32966.14s -> 32967.14s]  Just relax.
[32967.14s -> 32968.14s]  Pull back.
[32972.76s -> 32973.76s]  Go to the right side now.
[32973.76s -> 33000.34s]  Here we go.
[33000.34s -> 33001.34s]  Come on.
[33006.17s -> 33007.17s]  To the knees.
[33007.17s -> 33008.17s]  Oh shit.
[33008.17s -> 33009.17s]  Bullshit.
[33021.06s -> 33022.68s]  Percy.
[33022.68s -> 33026.35s]  What's that mean?
[33026.35s -> 33027.35s]  Don't hit the White House.
[33034.78s -> 33036.78s]  I got so much more important stuff going on than that.
[33036.78s -> 33037.78s]  Here we go.
[33037.78s -> 33038.78s]  All right.
[33038.78s -> 33039.78s]  In a good spot.
[33040.78s -> 33046.77s]  Do not shoot the fucking under the armor's skin.
[33049.35s -> 33050.35s]  Clear the whole area.
[33050.35s -> 33052.73s]  Dumb.
[33052.73s -> 33054.73s]  I am intensely focusing right now.
[33054.73s -> 33058.08s]  There it is.
[33058.08s -> 33059.08s]  I got plenty of ammo.
[33060.08s -> 33061.08s]  Get rid of this little base over.
[33061.08s -> 33062.08s]  Don't see that one.
[33063.08s -> 33064.08s]  Come for missiles.
[33064.08s -> 33065.08s]  Just relax.
[33066.08s -> 33067.08s]  It's not a big deal.
[33067.08s -> 33068.08s]  You've handled way worse.
[33069.08s -> 33087.02s]  Okay.
[33087.02s -> 33088.02s]  I could be very upset about it.
[33088.02s -> 33089.02s]  I could be very mad about that.
[33089.02s -> 33090.02s]  But I'm not going to be.
[33091.02s -> 33098.47s]  Nope.
[33098.47s -> 33099.47s]  Doing just fine.
[33099.47s -> 33100.47s]  Good.
[33100.47s -> 33101.47s]  Nice job.
[33101.47s -> 33103.71s]  I would shit my hand right now.
[33103.71s -> 33123.06s]  It's nice and easy.
[33123.06s -> 33124.06s]  Just nice and easy.
[33124.06s -> 33125.06s]  Don't hurt anything.
[33125.06s -> 33126.06s]  It's nice and easy.
[33127.06s -> 33129.52s]  It's going to open again.
[33130.52s -> 33133.49s]  Wait for it to open.
[33133.49s -> 33134.49s]  Do not shoot that.
[33134.49s -> 33136.49s]  Why is it on my display?
[33136.49s -> 33138.49s]  Why is it on my heads up display?
[33138.49s -> 33143.25s]  Off the side.
[33143.25s -> 33146.77s]  Clear the trash.
[33146.77s -> 33147.77s]  Right there.
[33147.77s -> 33148.77s]  Open up.
[33148.77s -> 33149.77s]  Come on.
[33149.77s -> 33157.22s]  Open up.
[33157.22s -> 33158.22s]  Open up.
[33158.22s -> 33159.58s]  This is the perfect weapon for this.
[33162.27s -> 33164.15s]  Shit.
[33164.15s -> 33165.15s]  What's firing at me from over here?
[33166.78s -> 33167.78s]  I don't have time for that.
[33167.78s -> 33170.68s]  Clear out the trash.
[33170.68s -> 33171.68s]  I have to.
[33171.68s -> 33173.68s]  I'm going to get dumped on.
[33179.95s -> 33180.95s]  It's you.
[33180.95s -> 33187.68s]  All right.
[33187.68s -> 33188.68s]  All right.
[33188.68s -> 33190.88s]  Get rid of this tank.
[33190.88s -> 33191.88s]  Enough.
[33191.88s -> 33194.34s]  Right side.
[33194.34s -> 33195.34s]  Done.
[33202.83s -> 33203.83s]  That's it?
[33203.83s -> 33204.83s]  Is there one more?
[33204.83s -> 33205.83s]  Where is it?
[33205.83s -> 33206.83s]  On the top?
[33214.54s -> 33217.50s]  It's up top.
[33217.50s -> 33219.06s]  Go too crazy.
[33219.06s -> 33220.06s]  Wait for the next one to open.
[33221.06s -> 33222.24s]  Do not.
[33222.24s -> 33223.24s]  Okay.
[33223.24s -> 33224.24s]  The White House is going to hurt.
[33224.24s -> 33238.09s]  Come.
[33258.85s -> 33259.85s]  I did it.
[33259.85s -> 33270.88s]  I beat the game.
[33270.88s -> 33271.88s]  Got my pods upgraded.
[33271.88s -> 33278.27s]  The White House was back in the hands of the American people that long last the United States had won back its freedom.
[33278.27s -> 33281.27s]  However, the mastermind of its misery remained at large.
[33281.27s -> 33286.27s]  The stage had been set for a final clash to determine whose version of justice the history books would honor.
[33286.27s -> 33292.27s]  The dice were about to be rolled one last time for America and it wasn't clear whose side Lady Luck was going to be on.
[33295.02s -> 33296.02s]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[33296.02s -> 33297.02s]  Yes.
[33297.02s -> 33298.02s]  Lady Luck.
[33298.02s -> 33299.02s]  My treasured has disappeared.
[33299.02s -> 33300.02s]  Showdown.
[33300.02s -> 33303.67s]  The special intelligence.
[33303.67s -> 33304.67s]  Wolf.
[33304.67s -> 33307.26s]  In Las Vegas.
[33307.26s -> 33310.33s]  The vice president is in Las Vegas.
[33310.33s -> 33311.33s]  Let's go.
[33311.33s -> 33312.33s]  Really?
[33312.33s -> 33314.33s]  Nobody rivals our intelligence gathering abilities.
[33314.33s -> 33318.30s]  Head for Las Vegas with me.
[33318.30s -> 33320.30s]  Well, not just me.
[33320.30s -> 33324.30s]  Everyone in the resistance will be rivaling support around the country.
[33324.30s -> 33325.30s]  I know.
[33325.30s -> 33326.30s]  Thanks.
[33326.30s -> 33327.30s]  Mr. President.
[33327.30s -> 33328.30s]  Good luck.
[33328.30s -> 33329.30s]  And Godspeed.
[33329.30s -> 33330.30s]  Jody.
[33330.30s -> 33331.30s]  Prepare Air Force One.
[33331.30s -> 33332.30s]  We're heading.
[33332.30s -> 33333.30s]  Yes, Mr. President.
[33333.30s -> 33334.30s]  Let's go.
[33334.30s -> 33339.80s]  The vice president, Rich.
[33339.80s -> 33341.80s]  My only advice to you is this.
[33341.80s -> 33344.80s]  Beat him to a pulp.
[33344.80s -> 33346.80s]  This mission goes by the call name.
[33346.80s -> 33349.49s]  Good luck and Godspeed, Mr. President.
[33349.49s -> 33350.49s]  That's the name.
[33350.49s -> 33351.49s]  Did I skip it?
[33351.49s -> 33352.49s]  No, I didn't.
[33352.49s -> 33354.88s]  Did I skip it?
[33359.00s -> 33370.22s]  Okay.
[33370.22s -> 33372.46s]  I need to buy something here.
[33372.46s -> 33373.46s]  Missile.
[33373.46s -> 33375.73s]  No, no, no, no.
[33375.73s -> 33376.73s]  What was it?
[33376.73s -> 33377.73s]  What was I going to do?
[33377.73s -> 33381.76s]  This is going to be just like on rails or something.
[33381.76s -> 33384.83s]  It's not going to be hard.
[33384.83s -> 33385.83s]  The Gatling gun.
[33385.83s -> 33386.83s]  Right.
[33386.83s -> 33387.83s]  That was right.
[33387.83s -> 33388.83s]  That was right.
[33388.83s -> 33389.83s]  That was right.
[33389.83s -> 33390.83s]  That was right.
[33390.83s -> 33396.30s]  Okay.
[33396.30s -> 33398.30s]  How much is this?
[33398.30s -> 33401.25s]  Gatling gun has been acquired.
[33401.25s -> 33406.30s]  Also, where's the next one?
[33406.30s -> 33408.30s]  I got the best bazooka, right?
[33408.30s -> 33409.30s]  I already got it.
[33409.30s -> 33410.30s]  Missile launcher.
[33410.30s -> 33412.61s]  This is the best missile launcher in the game.
[33412.61s -> 33413.98s]  I'll take it.
[33413.98s -> 33415.98s]  Put it on.
[33415.98s -> 33425.86s]  Okay.
[33425.86s -> 33426.86s]  That's that.
[33426.86s -> 33427.86s]  I'm going to put the other side.
[33427.86s -> 33430.17s]  It's going to be this thing.
[33430.17s -> 33431.17s]  This crazy thing.
[33431.17s -> 33434.17s]  So this is the big one here.
[33434.17s -> 33435.17s]  Okay.
[33435.17s -> 33437.17s]  Next is going to be.
[33437.17s -> 33438.17s]  I'm thinking.
[33438.17s -> 33442.94s]  Let's put the Gatling gun here.
[33442.94s -> 33445.12s]  32 Gatling guns.
[33445.12s -> 33446.12s]  I don't have enough.
[33446.12s -> 33461.90s]  Should be another machine gun then, shouldn't it?
[33461.90s -> 33466.09s]  Let's try with this.
[33466.09s -> 33467.09s]  I got all.
[33467.09s -> 33468.09s]  I got really good stuff.
[33468.09s -> 33469.09s]  Let's go.
[33469.09s -> 33470.33s]  Final mission.
[33470.33s -> 33471.76s]  Final mission of the game.
[33471.76s -> 33472.76s]  Let's go.
[33472.76s -> 33473.76s]  Richard, come on.
[33473.76s -> 33474.76s]  Oh, Michael.
[33474.76s -> 33479.65s]  You're so sweet.
[33479.65s -> 33484.41s]  Richard.
[33484.41s -> 33486.54s]  And for that, I owe you.
[33486.54s -> 33487.54s]  You canceled all my dreams and plans.
[33487.54s -> 33488.54s]  So now I've got a nice little present for you.
[33488.54s -> 33489.54s]  Here.
[33489.54s -> 33490.54s]  Do I have to.
[33490.54s -> 33491.72s]  Wait.
[33491.72s -> 33492.72s]  It's a gauntlet.
[33492.72s -> 33493.72s]  It's a gauntlet.
[33493.72s -> 33494.72s]  It's a gauntlet.
[33494.72s -> 33495.72s]  It's a gauntlet.
[33495.72s -> 33496.72s]  It's a gauntlet.
[33496.72s -> 33497.72s]  It's a gauntlet.
[33497.72s -> 33498.72s]  It's a gauntlet.
[33498.72s -> 33499.72s]  It's a gauntlet.
[33499.72s -> 33500.72s]  It's a gauntlet.
[33500.72s -> 33501.72s]  It's a gauntlet.
[33502.72s -> 33503.72s]  Here.
[33503.72s -> 33508.35s]  Do I have to.
[33508.35s -> 33509.35s]  Wait.
[33509.35s -> 33510.35s]  It's a gauntlet.
[33510.35s -> 33511.35s]  Let me ask you one last thing.
[33511.35s -> 33514.35s]  What do you want on your tombstone?
[33514.35s -> 33517.35s]  What do you want it to say, huh, Michael?
[33517.35s -> 33521.13s]  I think this is a block.
[33521.13s -> 33522.13s]  Oh, no.
[33522.13s -> 33523.13s]  Oh, please.
[33523.13s -> 33535.78s]  What do you want on your tombstone?
[33535.78s -> 33536.78s]  Hmm.
[33536.78s -> 33541.94s]  I can't catch that briefcase.
[33541.94s -> 33544.30s]  I killed him too fast.
[33544.30s -> 33546.30s]  I can't get the.
[33546.30s -> 33563.48s]  I hope that's not a valuable item.
[33563.48s -> 33564.48s]  Lovely footwork.
[33564.48s -> 33565.72s]  Richard.
[33565.72s -> 33566.72s]  Oh, it was a dummy.
[33566.72s -> 33568.72s]  Now try dancing with me.
[33568.72s -> 33577.40s]  This show's gonna run all night.
[33577.40s -> 33578.40s]  Richard.
[33578.40s -> 33585.63s]  Please, not all night.
[33585.63s -> 33587.63s]  Please, not all night.
[33587.63s -> 33590.19s]  It already has.
[33590.19s -> 33593.74s]  Where is he?
[33593.74s -> 33602.25s]  Is he just flying around?
[33602.25s -> 33614.24s]  Oh, my goodness.
[33614.24s -> 33615.24s]  Just hold on.
[33615.24s -> 33616.24s]  Wait a minute.
[33616.24s -> 33620.08s]  I got locked up here tonight, I think.
[33620.08s -> 33626.06s]  Where is he?
[33626.06s -> 33637.66s]  Almost caught.
[33637.66s -> 33638.66s]  Gatling gun.
[33638.66s -> 33639.97s]  Let's go.
[33639.97s -> 33652.04s]  I don't think I hit him one time.
[33652.04s -> 33697.16s]  I gotta get close.
[33697.16s -> 33728.72s]  That didn't hurt him.
[33728.72s -> 33729.72s]  He's bad.
[33729.72s -> 33730.72s]  Stop.
[33730.72s -> 33731.72s]  I'm fine.
[33731.72s -> 33736.42s]  Sweet.
[33736.42s -> 33737.42s]  Sweet.
[33737.42s -> 33741.55s]  You are so sweet, Michael.
[33741.55s -> 33744.55s]  Like gulping a cup of condensed milk.
[33744.55s -> 33746.55s]  What is going on now?
[33746.55s -> 33750.84s]  Think you can kill me, huh?
[33750.84s -> 33751.84s]  Sweet.
[33751.84s -> 33752.84s]  Sweet.
[33752.84s -> 33754.84s]  All right, let's take it outside.
[33754.84s -> 33758.55s]  I'm gonna keep the Gatling gun on.
[33758.55s -> 33759.55s]  This is fine.
[33759.55s -> 33767.48s]  I thought you guys were lying to me when the last level was Vegas.
[33767.48s -> 33769.48s]  That's so funny.
[33769.48s -> 33772.48s]  I did not think that that was gonna be...
[33772.48s -> 33776.30s]  Where'd he go from here?
[33776.30s -> 33783.94s]  Did he go inside?
[33783.94s -> 33791.86s]  This is not an epic fight anymore.
[33791.86s -> 33795.53s]  Oh, wait.
[33797.15s -> 33805.64s]  ...were among the POWs you rescued.
[33805.64s -> 33811.27s]  Further in?
[33811.27s -> 33824.20s]  I need him to, like, clap his hands.
[33824.20s -> 33825.20s]  I am.
[33825.20s -> 33832.80s]  Good challenge.
[33832.80s -> 33833.80s]  He went out that way.
[33833.80s -> 33851.27s]  Okay, good.
[33851.27s -> 33853.70s]  He's out here.
[33853.70s -> 33857.20s]  Richard, you can run, but you can't hide.
[33857.20s -> 33865.90s]  Catch your dream.
[33865.90s -> 33866.90s]  Banana.
[33866.90s -> 33870.86s]  You gonna complain?
[33870.86s -> 33871.86s]  He's a coward.
[33871.86s -> 33873.86s]  I can't win.
[33873.86s -> 33874.86s]  So shoot me, Michael.
[33874.86s -> 33875.86s]  Who's mocking who?
[33875.86s -> 33877.86s]  Or are you a chicken?
[33880.86s -> 33882.86s]  Knock that jerk off the roof.
[33882.86s -> 33885.86s]  Show him who will have the last laugh.
[33885.86s -> 33888.86s]  Knock that jerk off the roof.
[33888.86s -> 33892.74s]  He's a jerk.
[33892.74s -> 33900.26s]  Hit him.
[33900.26s -> 33901.26s]  Did I get him?
[33901.26s -> 33906.36s]  I didn't get him.
[33906.36s -> 33907.36s]  There it is.
[33907.36s -> 33911.52s]  You break it, you bought it, Michael.
[33911.52s -> 33915.52s]  Michael, you'll pay for the damages with your life.
[33915.52s -> 33929.14s]  Out of ammo.
[33929.14s -> 33931.14s]  I can't get off of this.
[33931.14s -> 33935.46s]  Killing you is easier than breaking a baby's arm.
[33935.46s -> 33936.46s]  Holy shit.
[33936.46s -> 33943.44s]  What the hell did he just say?
[33943.44s -> 33944.44s]  Jesus.
[33944.44s -> 33961.45s]  Phase three.
[33961.45s -> 33969.81s]  Shall I take you to the next stage?
[33969.81s -> 33971.75s]  Yeah.
[33971.75s -> 33972.75s]  He's on the move again.
[33972.75s -> 33975.75s]  I do need ammo.
[33975.75s -> 33977.75s]  I wonder if I can get it from anything in here.
[33977.75s -> 33981.85s]  Offensive augment.
[33981.85s -> 33982.85s]  I'm going to take my time here.
[33982.85s -> 33984.85s]  I won't go in like a dumpster.
[33984.85s -> 33990.46s]  Go boxes with his heavy weapons.
[33990.46s -> 33992.72s]  In the arms.
[33992.72s -> 33993.72s]  Good.
[33993.72s -> 33996.96s]  Not any Gatling gun ammo, though.
[33996.96s -> 33998.96s]  That's a real bummer.
[33998.96s -> 34007.98s]  There are crates behind me.
[34007.98s -> 34008.98s]  Oh, fuck.
[34008.98s -> 34016.77s]  All the way down.
[34016.77s -> 34020.70s]  How did I miss that?
[34020.70s -> 34026.38s]  Because I was scrolling through to see what ammo that was.
[34026.38s -> 34031.95s]  Actually, that's worth it.
[34031.95s -> 34033.95s]  The vice president moved behind the passageway.
[34033.95s -> 34036.95s]  Mr. President, chase after him.
[34036.95s -> 34038.95s]  I know.
[34038.95s -> 34049.70s]  Light arms.
[34049.70s -> 34050.70s]  All right.
[34050.70s -> 34055.08s]  Heavy arms.
[34055.08s -> 34058.73s]  Shield unit.
[34058.73s -> 34061.74s]  Is he going to cut me off?
[34061.74s -> 34065.60s]  How lovely.
[34065.60s -> 34077.24s]  Doesn't knowing that it all ends here kind of get your adrenaline going?
[34077.24s -> 34079.24s]  I wonder those crates.
[34079.24s -> 34084.09s]  Richard.
[34084.09s -> 34091.83s]  Michael.
[34091.83s -> 34093.83s]  At the stage all to ourselves.
[34093.83s -> 34094.83s]  Uh-oh, it's final destination.
[34094.83s -> 34095.83s]  No weapons?
[34095.83s -> 34099.83s]  It ends here.
[34099.83s -> 34109.12s]  I don't know where to go.
[34109.12s -> 34111.12s]  I thought I was going to fall off here and die.
[34111.12s -> 34135.44s]  Like Virtua Fighter style.
[34135.44s -> 34142.99s]  Get it.
[34142.99s -> 34154.94s]  Oh.
[34154.94s -> 34155.94s]  Cracking.
[34155.94s -> 34156.94s]  I'm starting to crack.
[34156.94s -> 34157.94s]  I got to hold on.
[34157.94s -> 34161.53s]  I'm cracking.
[34161.53s -> 34171.47s]  Take it and dodge and take it to your grave.
[34171.47s -> 34173.47s]  He's doing his, like, super move.
[34173.47s -> 34205.84s]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[34206.84s -> 34211.96s]  It's not over.
[34211.96s -> 34212.96s]  This is, like, phase five.
[34212.96s -> 34214.96s]  Like hell it is.
[34214.96s -> 34228.98s]  I have to fight this space shuttle?
[34228.98s -> 34231.54s]  Oh, my God.
[34231.54s -> 34235.31s]  Space station?
[34235.31s -> 34236.81s]  Mr. President?
[34236.81s -> 34239.18s]  The scene is pointless.
[34239.18s -> 34245.48s]  The reason is because I'm the president of the great United States of America.
[34245.48s -> 34247.87s]  Yeah!
[34247.87s -> 34249.43s]  Mr. President?
[34249.43s -> 34252.43s]  Jodie, I'm going to step out into outer space.
[34252.43s -> 34254.43s]  See you soon!
[34254.43s -> 34263.80s]  Let's do this again.
[34263.80s -> 34271.56s]  E-E-A-S-E-A.
[34271.56s -> 34283.46s]  Gold to play on Vegas.
[34283.46s -> 34288.79s]  Given over 10 years of my life to this profession and no scene has ever engraved itself upon my mind the way this one did.
[34288.79s -> 34290.79s]  Two men, two ideals, one outcome.
[34290.79s -> 34294.79s]  I cannot imagine where we would all stand now that things have gone the other way.
[34294.79s -> 34296.79s]  President, are you all right?
[34296.79s -> 34298.48s]  Yes.
[34298.48s -> 34302.48s]  I've been very pleased about my first flight in space.
[34302.48s -> 34307.04s]  But I just wish I had brought my camera.
[34307.04s -> 34311.28s]  Mr. President, be sure and come back now.
[34311.28s -> 34313.28s]  The American people are waiting for you.
[34313.28s -> 34317.28s]  She says Mr. President as much as I say, oh, my God.
[34317.28s -> 34322.28s]  I am the president of the United States of America.
[34322.28s -> 34326.17s]  Be back.
[34326.17s -> 34327.17s]  Mr. President?
[34327.17s -> 34330.17s]  Please continue to update me as the battle goes on.
[34330.17s -> 34331.17s]  Sure.
[34331.17s -> 34334.17s]  Oh, and contact the Japanese embassy.
[34334.17s -> 34337.17s]  Tell them we can hold that wildlife protection conference.
[34337.17s -> 34339.17s]  He's not in space anymore?
[34339.17s -> 34341.17s]  Wait, did he take the helmet off?
[34341.17s -> 34343.17s]  He took the helmet off.
[34343.17s -> 34345.17s]  Mr. President, don't take off the helmet!
[34345.17s -> 34347.17s]  What are you trying to do?
[34347.17s -> 34359.96s]  In sinister nature, I predict he has some unexpected trump card up his sleeve.
[34359.96s -> 34364.97s]  But Mr. President, be victorious at all costs.
[34364.97s -> 34370.59s]  The reason is because you're the president of this great land.
[34370.59s -> 34372.59s]  This mission goes by the call name...
[34372.59s -> 34374.59s]  To the moon.
[34374.59s -> 34378.48s]  Believe in justice.
[34378.48s -> 34385.20s]  Best of luck, and Godspeed, Mr. President.
[34385.20s -> 34386.20s]  All right.
[34386.20s -> 34390.63s]  What am I missing that I can invest in?
[34390.63s -> 34392.63s]  I like what I got now.
[34392.63s -> 34395.63s]  Assault weapons, right? Assault rifles.
[34395.63s -> 34398.32s]  I'm going to get the best assault rifle, like, in the world.
[34398.32s -> 34400.32s]  The RFRH.
[34400.32s -> 34412.33s]  Assault, where is it? Assault, assault, assault, assault.
[34412.33s -> 34414.33s]  Assault weapons, there we go.
[34414.33s -> 34418.02s]  What is it?
[34418.02s -> 34420.02s]  The RFRH.
[34420.02s -> 34433.59s]  I do want...
[34433.59s -> 34435.59s]  If I can get it, I want two of these.
[34435.59s -> 34448.26s]  I can't get it.
[34448.26s -> 34469.62s]  Well, I got the Gatling gun, and then I'm going to put the assault rifle, that RFRH, here to get double, triple firepower.
[34469.62s -> 34472.31s]  Give it a flamethrower.
[34472.31s -> 34475.70s]  Check out the handguns.
[34475.70s -> 34478.58s]  Maybe. I'll check them out.
[34478.58s -> 34485.56s]  Handguns.
[34485.56s -> 34487.56s]  Might as well do it, all right?
[34487.56s -> 34493.88s]  29.
[34493.88s -> 34496.76s]  9PA.
[34496.76s -> 34499.51s]  DE91.
[34499.51s -> 34501.51s]  DE91EN.
[34501.51s -> 34504.20s]  DE91PA.
[34504.20s -> 34507.53s]  M45.
[34507.53s -> 34513.16s]  Don't have enough money.
[34513.16s -> 34515.16s]  I don't think I can even make it.
[34515.16s -> 34517.16s]  Am I still going to stream tomorrow? Yeah.
[34517.16s -> 34520.49s]  I'm just not going to stream at, like, 12.
[34520.49s -> 34522.49s]  I'll stream at, like, 4.
[34522.49s -> 34524.92s]  I'll be all right.
[34524.92s -> 34527.92s]  I'm not going to do a 10 or 11 hour stream. I don't understand how these happen. They just do.
[34527.92s -> 34534.85s]  Yeah, I mean, today, it's almost been, I can't believe it's almost been 11 hours.
[34534.85s -> 34538.18s]  What the hell am I doing?
[34538.18s -> 34546.18s]  All right, I'm going to try it with this, but I'm going to take off the trash here, which is, like, absolute trash.
[34546.18s -> 34555.76s]  Put on Sam.
[34555.76s -> 34557.76s]  Actually, no, put this on. I feel like I could get use out of that.
[34557.76s -> 34561.22s]  Yeah, this looks all right.
[34561.22s -> 34565.57s]  Let's give it a go.
[34565.57s -> 34574.67s]  I know, you even commented earlier on keeping Eastern viewers up until, like, 3.
[34574.67s -> 34576.67s]  I know.
[34576.67s -> 34578.98s]  Final mission, here we go.
[34578.98s -> 34584.02s]  Richard!
[34584.02s -> 34586.02s]  Chasing 15 million feet after me.
[34586.02s -> 34588.02s]  Now that's love.
[34588.02s -> 34592.02s]  Well, I love you too, Michael.
[34592.02s -> 34598.02s]  I love you so much, I can't stand it.
[34598.02s -> 34602.02s]  So much, I want to kill you.
[34602.02s -> 34609.18s]  Hold it, Richard!
[34609.18s -> 34621.23s]  Take a long-ass look at the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way.
[34621.23s -> 34629.23s]  Of all man's achievements in the 21st century, this is the climax!
[34629.23s -> 34633.23s]  It's a big cannon. Two big cannons.
[34633.23s -> 34635.23s]  I only have 300 seconds to beat this.
[34635.23s -> 34637.23s]  I don't even know where to start.
[34637.23s -> 34645.30s]  Mr. President, the barrier is shut.
[34645.30s -> 34649.66s]  You won't be able to advance if you don't destroy it.
[34649.66s -> 34661.30s]  Let's go!
[34661.30s -> 34671.92s]  Almost out of time!
[34671.92s -> 34675.12s]  I'm at 11 hours, man.
[34675.12s -> 34677.12s]  Give me a break.
[34677.12s -> 34679.12s]  Give me a little slack.
[34679.12s -> 34715.07s]  I think so.
[34715.07s -> 34719.07s]  Mr. President, do you think you can just run away?
[34719.07s -> 34729.82s]  Mr. President!
[34729.82s -> 34750.83s]  I need to lead a little bit of strength.
[34750.83s -> 34771.49s]  Full of energy.
[34771.49s -> 34773.49s]  I'm not playing the game right now.
[34773.49s -> 34777.71s]  I'm going to check in as well.
[34777.71s -> 34787.06s]  Just kidding, it's me.
[34787.06s -> 34805.94s]  What am I supposed to be doing?
[34805.94s -> 34819.31s]  Up, up, up, up!
[34819.31s -> 34826.98s]  Shit!
[34826.98s -> 34830.11s]  I can't destroy the ladder.
[34830.11s -> 34840.22s]  Alright, let's go!
[34840.22s -> 34859.23s]  You guys all going up there too?
[34859.23s -> 34863.63s]  Cool.
[34863.63s -> 34886.93s]  You know Richard.
[34941.14s -> 34949.20s]  What's going on?
[34949.20s -> 34972.22s]  I'm fine.
[34972.22s -> 34978.29s]  I'm fucking...
[34978.29s -> 34992.30s]  God, how do I get out of here?
[34992.30s -> 34997.68s]  Okay.
[34997.68s -> 35005.73s]  Oh my God.
[35005.73s -> 35009.38s]  Yeah, I'm fine.
[35009.38s -> 35013.60s]  I'm just fucking laughing really hard.
[35013.60s -> 35027.31s]  Sometimes I look over here, man, and I fucking see something so stupid, so funny.
[35027.31s -> 35029.31s]  You guys kill me sometimes.
[35029.31s -> 35031.31s]  Richard!
[35031.31s -> 35038.29s]  What do you stand for, Michael?
[35038.29s -> 35040.29s]  Be certain now.
[35040.29s -> 35042.53s]  As certain as the blood gushing out of your mouth.
[35042.53s -> 35046.53s]  As certain as the blood gushing out of your mouth when I bash it in.
[35046.53s -> 35050.53s]  Be certain of your death here and now.
[35050.53s -> 35052.53s]  Okay, I'm good.
[35052.53s -> 35056.18s]  Now I have to fight this thing.
[35056.18s -> 35061.70s]  Now, come at me with all your body and soul.
[35061.70s -> 35064.51s]  I'll hug you to death.
[35064.51s -> 35066.88s]  Okay.
[35066.88s -> 35070.88s]  Mr. President, the fuselage damage rate is above 50%.
[35070.88s -> 35072.88s]  Jesus, come on.
[35072.88s -> 35074.88s]  I have so much of this shit.
[35074.88s -> 35090.30s]  You didn't break any of them.
[35090.30s -> 35097.71s]  Dude, no, he does.
[35097.71s -> 35108.40s]  But I have the super thing.
[35108.40s -> 35124.08s]  I see health over there.
[35124.08s -> 35126.58s]  There's health over here.
[35126.58s -> 35134.11s]  Oh, fuck.
[35134.11s -> 35136.80s]  There's a health over there.
[35136.80s -> 35139.68s]  I'm going to get it.
[35139.68s -> 35142.11s]  He's standing now in this tiny arena.
[35142.11s -> 35144.11s]  Oh, God damn it.
[35146.11s -> 35149.30s]  I have this health to my left or right.
[35149.30s -> 35151.30s]  Left, I think.
[35151.30s -> 35161.92s]  It even matters.
[35164.31s -> 35170.97s]  Like, impossible.
[35170.97s -> 35172.97s]  Literally not even possible.
[35183.96s -> 35185.96s]  It's scripted, it's scripted.
[35187.96s -> 35189.96s]  It's scripted, it's scripted.
[35189.96s -> 35192.39s]  I win.
[35193.39s -> 35197.76s]  Way to go, Mr. President.
[35197.76s -> 35203.31s]  That is like unbearable.
[35203.31s -> 35205.31s]  That fight is fucking unbearable.
[35205.31s -> 35207.74s]  It's just like obnoxious.
[35207.74s -> 35208.74s]  Like, what the fuck?
[35208.74s -> 35222.55s]  You gotta give me a break.
[35222.55s -> 35224.55s]  That's just dumb.
[35224.55s -> 35235.50s]  What a dumb fucking fight.
[35235.50s -> 35237.50s]  Spam daddy a little bit.
[35237.50s -> 35240.18s]  Just spam.
[35240.18s -> 35295.59s]  I'm stuck the whole thing.
[35295.59s -> 35297.59s]  It's like a musician's face.
[35297.59s -> 35319.29s]  What's the strategy with this guy?
[35319.29s -> 35326.34s]  You just hold spray and you don't get hit by a random bullet?
[35326.34s -> 35363.14s]  What is that noise?
[35363.14s -> 35366.14s]  I'm beyond the point of my return here.
[35366.14s -> 35388.06s]  Here we go.
[35388.06s -> 35399.77s]  I'm saving my super for the big fight.
[35399.77s -> 35409.24s]  The real one.
[35409.24s -> 35411.24s]  A speed upgrade or something.
[35411.24s -> 35413.24s]  I feel like I'm so much slower than these things.
[35413.24s -> 35417.24s]  You know what? I gotta get a thing that destroys all incoming projectiles.
[35421.08s -> 35424.86s]  Actually, I can't fucking believe it.
[35424.86s -> 35427.22s]  I'm desperate.
[35427.22s -> 35428.22s]  But I'm still firing.
[35428.22s -> 35430.22s]  I think I'm firing still.
[35435.04s -> 35437.04s]  What a joke.
[35437.04s -> 35441.04s]  What the fuck was that?
[35446.18s -> 35448.18s]  What?
[35448.18s -> 35450.18s]  I have to get the thing that destroys...
[35455.50s -> 35459.79s]  This is not even a video game.
[35459.79s -> 35461.79s]  This isn't a video game.
[35461.79s -> 35464.80s]  I'm just coming to that realization right now.
[35464.80s -> 35486.24s]  This is not even a game.
[35486.24s -> 35498.29s]  I need one of those laser beams that destroy all projectiles.
[35498.29s -> 35500.29s]  This fucking game.
[35500.29s -> 35502.59s]  It's like...
[35502.59s -> 35504.77s]  Why?
[35504.77s -> 35509.70s]  Why?
[35509.70s -> 35511.70s]  Ben Boss is just...
[35511.70s -> 35513.70s]  I'm not allowed to say it.
[35513.70s -> 35517.28s]  Am I allowed to say it?
[35517.28s -> 35519.28s]  Should I say it?
[35519.28s -> 35521.28s]  I think I'm just gonna say it.
[35521.28s -> 35530.30s]  This game sucks.
[35530.30s -> 35549.18s]  Somebody look at the ratings for this game.
[35549.18s -> 35551.18s]  What does it have right now?
[35551.18s -> 35557.26s]  Alright, I need to do...
[35557.26s -> 35564.88s]  Wait, it's a machine gun. Right here it is.
[35564.88s -> 35567.06s]  Intercepting fire.
[35567.06s -> 35574.93s]  I just want like three of these.
[35574.93s -> 35576.93s]  I think that changes everything. I really think it does.
[35576.93s -> 35578.93s]  I think this thing here...
[35578.93s -> 35586.03s]  Should help.
[35586.03s -> 35590.70s]  I'm gonna do this one or two more times.
[35590.70s -> 35611.31s]  Never let the joke die.
[35611.31s -> 35622.58s]  Out of here!
[35622.58s -> 35624.58s]  Oh shit, I forgot about the ceiling.
[35624.58s -> 35639.36s]  I can't look at the link right now.
[35639.36s -> 35641.36s]  I'm busy trying to complete this game.
[35641.36s -> 35644.37s]  It's taking all of my attention.
[35644.37s -> 35663.12s]  Look at the virus.
[35663.12s -> 35680.85s]  Wait, what?
[35680.85s -> 35682.85s]  Oh, right.
[35682.85s -> 35686.18s]  Let's get out the big ones.
[35686.18s -> 35689.44s]  Target, target, target.
[35689.44s -> 35693.66s]  Why is it not locking on?
[35693.66s -> 35695.66s]  No, that's not gonna work.
[35695.66s -> 35700.91s]  Why is it not locking on?
[35700.91s -> 35706.42s]  I'm rolling up.
[35706.42s -> 35708.42s]  So it's on my left side.
[35708.42s -> 35711.23s]  This is gonna be what's necessary.
[35711.23s -> 35720.90s]  I'm gonna skip this part.
[35720.90s -> 35724.86s]  I'm gonna skip this part.
[35724.86s -> 35726.86s]  I'm gonna skip this part.
[35726.86s -> 35728.86s]  I have 167 seconds.
[35728.86s -> 35730.86s]  If I get up here without with 150 seconds remaining.
[35730.86s -> 35732.86s]  Let's start from here.
[35735.49s -> 35745.09s]  I have to play the game.
[35745.09s -> 35753.26s]  Okay, here we go.
[35753.26s -> 35755.26s]  It's time.
[35755.26s -> 35757.89s]  Bring it out, the MP7.
[35757.89s -> 35759.89s]  And then the...
[35759.89s -> 35763.73s]  This thing.
[35763.73s -> 35765.73s]  Let's hope it's enough.
[35765.73s -> 35768.16s]  Will it be enough?
[35768.16s -> 35770.16s]  Only 20 bullets on this thing, keep in mind.
[35770.16s -> 35772.16s]  Will it be enough?
[35772.16s -> 35774.59s]  I'm going. Go.
[35774.59s -> 35782.53s]  It is a little bit better, I think.
[35782.53s -> 35784.96s]  Although this is probably...
[35784.96s -> 35807.62s]  This might just be a placebo effect.
[35807.62s -> 35809.62s]  No, no, it wants back, please.
[35809.62s -> 35817.04s]  I gotta get rid of all the assault rifles.
[35817.04s -> 35819.04s]  I got nothing else, do I?
[35819.04s -> 35821.04s]  In the fucking other hands. Oh, this is bad.
[35821.04s -> 35823.04s]  This is really, really, really bad.
[35823.04s -> 35826.50s]  I need ammo.
[35826.50s -> 35845.49s]  Please. Get out of the corner.
[35855.98s -> 35885.23s]  Here we go.
[35885.23s -> 35887.23s]  There cannot be another phrase.
[35909.30s -> 35912.05s]  Where is he going?
[35920.99s -> 35922.99s]  Did I do it?
[35922.99s -> 35936.43s]  That was easy.
[35936.43s -> 35943.14s]  Was that me or him? I did it.
[35961.76s -> 35963.76s]  Shooting star.
[35963.76s -> 35965.76s]  Jodie, who am I?
[35965.76s -> 35967.76s]  I'm the president.
[35967.76s -> 35969.76s]  I always make
[35969.76s -> 35971.76s]  the impossible possible.
[35971.76s -> 35973.76s]  And I'm gonna keep on doing so.
[35975.76s -> 35986.56s]  Michael.
[35986.56s -> 35988.56s]  Richard, it was your methods
[35988.56s -> 35990.56s]  that were flawed. Our love
[35990.56s -> 35992.99s]  for America won't change.
[36003.36s -> 36005.36s]  Richard!
[36005.36s -> 36007.36s]  You're just gonna kill me!
[36035.60s -> 36045.07s]  This is how I'm sitting.
[36047.07s -> 36049.63s]  I'll show you after.
[36049.63s -> 36052.38s]  This is how I'm sitting.
[36052.38s -> 36054.38s]  Tomorrow's gonna be
[36054.38s -> 36056.38s]  another busy day at the
[36056.38s -> 36058.38s]  White House.
[36058.38s -> 36060.38s]  That was fun.
[36060.38s -> 36062.56s]  This is how I was sitting during the cutscene.
[36062.56s -> 36067.55s]  My fellow Americans,
[36067.55s -> 36071.71s]  good morning.
[36071.71s -> 36073.71s]  As Americans, we love
[36073.71s -> 36076.78s]  freedom. But true
[36076.78s -> 36078.78s]  freedom isn't a given like the air
[36078.78s -> 36080.78s]  we breathe or the water we drink.
[36080.78s -> 36084.88s]  About 240
[36084.88s -> 36086.88s]  years ago,
[36086.88s -> 36088.88s]  our forefathers fought greatly
[36088.88s -> 36090.88s]  giving their blood, sweat
[36090.88s -> 36092.88s]  and tears. And in the
[36092.88s -> 36094.88s]  end, they won our freedom.
[36094.88s -> 36097.82s]  And we must
[36097.82s -> 36099.82s]  never forget this.
[36099.82s -> 36102.06s]  If anything appears
[36102.06s -> 36104.43s]  that threatens
[36104.43s -> 36106.43s]  our belief in this freedom,
[36106.43s -> 36108.93s]  we will oppose
[36108.93s -> 36110.93s]  it. We will crush
[36110.93s -> 36115.02s]  it. In fighting
[36115.02s -> 36117.02s]  to gain our freedom, we
[36117.02s -> 36119.02s]  need no reasons.
[36119.02s -> 36122.22s]  We require
[36122.22s -> 36124.22s]  no just cause or flowery
[36124.22s -> 36127.49s]  words. In order
[36127.49s -> 36129.49s]  to protect our neighbors who love
[36129.49s -> 36131.49s]  freedom and this faith in freedom,
[36131.49s -> 36133.92s]  we continue
[36133.92s -> 36135.92s]  to believe in our own justice.
[36135.92s -> 36137.92s]  We
[36137.92s -> 36139.92s]  won't abandon any battles.
[36139.92s -> 36141.92s]  And the
[36141.92s -> 36143.92s]  reason is
[36143.92s -> 36145.92s]  because we are
[36145.92s -> 36147.92s]  all citizens of the United
[36147.92s -> 36149.92s]  States of America.
[36153.92s -> 36155.92s]  I will be a vanguard
[36155.92s -> 36157.92s]  leading this fight.
[36157.92s -> 36160.10s]  And the reason is
[36160.10s -> 36162.10s]  because
[36162.10s -> 36164.10s]  I'm the president of
[36164.10s -> 36166.10s]  this great United States
[36166.10s -> 36168.10s]  of America.
[36202.05s -> 36227.89s]  Welcome.
[36227.89s -> 36234.42s]  What would you score this game? A 3.
[36234.42s -> 36248.43s]  Out of 5.
[36248.43s -> 36251.18s]  2.5 out of 5.
[36251.18s -> 36257.33s]  I would eat here.
[36257.33s -> 36259.82s]  I would give this 2.5 out of 5.
[36259.82s -> 36261.82s]  The 2.6 out of 5 just because
[36261.82s -> 36263.82s]  of the funny voice acting.
[36263.82s -> 36273.68s]  52 out of 100.
[36273.68s -> 36285.84s]  Hey, I played it, didn't I?
[36285.84s -> 36287.84s]  If I hated it, I wouldn't have done it.
[36287.84s -> 36293.07s]  Now I'll click the link.
[36293.07s -> 36295.07s]  That was Metal Wolf Chaos XD.
[36295.07s -> 36306.40s]  Let's look at this link.
[36306.40s -> 36317.09s]  Oh my god.
[36317.09s -> 36331.94s]  I look like the main character from
[36331.94s -> 36341.41s]  Number Bunchers.
[36341.41s -> 36343.90s]  By the way, that wasn't even from McDonald's.
[36343.90s -> 36346.21s]  That was from Wendy's.
[36346.21s -> 36348.38s]  What a scammer.
[36348.38s -> 36360.61s]  Alright, I'm
[36360.61s -> 36365.60s]  leaving. I'm outta here.
[36365.60s -> 36372.32s]  What about the
[36372.32s -> 36374.32s]  tier lists?
[36374.32s -> 36380.40s]  That was fun. It was.
[36380.40s -> 36382.83s]  For all how bullshit some of the
[36382.83s -> 36384.83s]  stuff was in this game and how over the top it was
[36384.83s -> 36386.83s]  and how weird some of it was.
[36386.83s -> 36388.83s]  I still enjoyed
[36388.83s -> 36390.83s]  myself.
[36390.83s -> 36392.83s]  5.9 out of 10.
[36392.83s -> 36394.83s]  There you go, just barely below 6.
[36394.83s -> 36396.83s]  Almost a passing grade. No, but that's still alright.
[36396.83s -> 36410.34s]  5.9.
[36410.34s -> 36412.34s]  That's alright. That was worth it.
[36412.34s -> 36416.24s]  Some teachers
[36416.24s -> 36418.24s]  actually will pass you if you get a 5.9.
[36418.24s -> 36431.94s]  If you get a 59,
[36431.94s -> 36433.94s]  that's a 5.9, but if you
[36433.94s -> 36435.94s]  nostalgia factor,
[36435.94s -> 36437.94s]  it could probably bump you up to like a 6.5.
[36437.94s -> 36444.08s]  6.4.
[36444.08s -> 36446.08s]  I'm gonna do the bits tomorrow.
[36446.08s -> 36448.90s]  I actually like am dying
[36448.90s -> 36450.90s]  at this scene.
[36450.90s -> 36452.90s]  We'll do the bits tomorrow.
[36452.90s -> 36454.90s]  We'll do a little just hangout session at the end of tomorrow.
[36454.90s -> 36457.39s]  Tomorrow is not going to be
[36457.39s -> 36459.39s]  an 11 hour stream. I can guarantee that.
[36459.39s -> 36461.89s]  I can promise you that.
[36461.89s -> 36463.89s]  So we'll go over these bits tomorrow.
[36463.89s -> 36465.89s]  The stream's not gonna be...
[36465.89s -> 36474.91s]  The stream's gonna start in like
[36474.91s -> 36477.86s]  16 hours.
[36477.86s -> 36479.86s]  14 hours or something.
[36479.86s -> 36481.86s]  I don't know.
[36481.86s -> 36491.39s]  16 hours. 14 hours or something.
[36491.39s -> 36493.39s]  I'm just wrecked
[36493.39s -> 36499.73s]  right now.
[36499.73s -> 36501.73s]  We're not gonna go that late tomorrow, I promise.
[36501.73s -> 36504.54s]  Because tomorrow is
[36504.54s -> 36506.54s]  gonna be a little more elaborate.
[36506.54s -> 36509.55s]  Tomorrow I'm playing You're in the Movies.
[36509.55s -> 36511.55s]  It's gonna be an on camera
[36511.55s -> 36513.55s]  stream with a green screen behind me.
[36513.55s -> 36515.55s]  It's a whole game based around being on a green screen.
[36515.55s -> 36520.54s]  Yeah, sorry I'm not doing
[36520.54s -> 36522.54s]  the bits. I hate to...
[36522.54s -> 36524.54s]  I really hate doing this, but we'll do them all tomorrow.
[36524.54s -> 36528.77s]  Kinda like we did last time when the
[36528.77s -> 36530.77s]  stream got cut off. We just kinda hung out.
[36530.77s -> 36532.77s]  Played a game and just kinda chilled and
[36532.77s -> 36535.52s]  went over them and talked about stuff.
[36535.52s -> 36537.52s]  The credits I can do, because the credits are
[36537.52s -> 36543.09s]  right here. The sub credits.
[36543.09s -> 36550.38s]  Wow, we're here though. I do wanna catch the
[36550.38s -> 36557.04s]  community subs that I did miss.
[36557.04s -> 36559.04s]  I do wanna say that.
[36559.04s -> 36561.04s]  Say thanks to those people, because there was a bunch of community subs tonight.
[36561.04s -> 36565.39s]  Here they come!
[36565.39s -> 36567.63s]  Can you see them?
[36567.63s -> 36571.39s]  Why can I not see these?
[36571.39s -> 36575.23s]  Roll credits, let's go. Holy shit, that's a lot.
[36575.23s -> 36577.47s]  Thank you everybody for the subs.
[36577.47s -> 36590.26s]  Seriously.
[36590.26s -> 36592.26s]  A lot of fucking resubs, a lot of community subs.
[36592.26s -> 36594.50s]  Speaking of community subs.
[36594.50s -> 36596.50s]  Magellan gave 5 community subs.
[36596.50s -> 36598.86s]  Kazzy gave 5 community subs.
[36598.86s -> 36600.86s]  JermaSucks gave 5 community subs.
[36600.86s -> 36606.86s]  Thank you.
[36606.86s -> 36608.86s]  There was a lot of random $150
[36608.86s -> 36610.86s]  bits we went over. I think we got all of them.
[36610.86s -> 36617.01s]  And we will absolutely
[36617.01s -> 36619.01s]  slowly go over these tomorrow after
[36619.01s -> 36621.01s]  this stream. Am I quiet?
[36621.01s -> 36623.01s]  Oh yeah, that's right. Why is this so quiet?
[36623.01s -> 36626.40s]  Sorry about that. And then Tingy right now,
[36626.40s -> 36634.85s]  thanks for the 5 community subs.
[36634.85s -> 36637.28s]  That game was good. I liked that game.
[36637.28s -> 36640.67s]  Enough to give it a 6.3.
[36640.67s -> 36644.70s]  What did I say?
[36644.70s -> 36646.70s]  5.9? 5.9.
[36646.70s -> 36648.70s]  I think 6.1 is fair.
[36648.70s -> 36659.71s]  I'll meet you in the middle.
[36659.71s -> 36664.90s]  Keeps going up.
[36664.90s -> 36666.90s]  Rank all the FromSoftware games.
[36666.90s -> 36669.20s]  Bloodborne, Demon's Souls.
[36673.10s -> 36675.47s]  Dark Souls 1.
[36675.47s -> 36678.54s]  Sekiro and Dark Souls 3
[36678.54s -> 36680.54s]  are kind of tied, I think.
[36680.54s -> 36682.78s]  Dark Souls 2.
[36682.78s -> 36687.90s]  I said Demon's Souls, yeah.
[36687.90s -> 36689.90s]  Demon's Souls is at the top. So Dark Souls 2.
[36689.90s -> 36693.62s]  Every video game
[36693.62s -> 36695.62s]  that released for Super Nintendo.
[36695.62s -> 36697.62s]  Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1,
[36697.62s -> 36701.46s]  PlayStation 2.
[36701.46s -> 36703.46s]  Every putt-putt game.
[36703.46s -> 36709.02s]  And then Metal Wolf Chaos.
[36709.02s -> 36720.59s]  Is this worst
[36720.59s -> 36722.96s]  or best? That's maybe.
[36722.96s -> 36725.20s]  He's still bad.
[36725.20s -> 36727.20s]  No I'm not.
[36727.20s -> 36730.02s]  Ow.
[36730.02s -> 36732.02s]  This is one of those strange moments.
[36732.02s -> 36734.02s]  Sometimes
[36734.02s -> 36736.02s]  you just lock in
[36736.02s -> 36738.02s]  and decide you're going to do something.
[36738.02s -> 36742.80s]  Love of Sekiro
[36742.80s -> 36744.80s]  destroys people's egos and makes them
[36744.80s -> 36746.80s]  really mad at it. It did that to me.
[36746.80s -> 36748.80s]  I was so
[36748.80s -> 36750.80s]  frustrated in Sekiro.
[36750.80s -> 36752.80s]  I did it though. I completed it. I got to the very end.
[36752.80s -> 36765.86s]  This had like
[36765.86s -> 36767.86s]  3 meltdowns. It was impressive.
[36767.86s -> 36770.03s]  Oh it was big. 11 hours.
[36770.03s -> 36772.03s]  It's almost 11 and a half hours.
[36772.03s -> 36774.03s]  That's like almost two streams.
[36774.03s -> 36781.07s]  No. It was more like
[36781.07s -> 36783.07s]  one funny pretend
[36783.07s -> 36785.07s]  laugh out loud meltdown.
[36785.07s -> 36787.76s]  One real meltdown.
[36787.76s -> 36793.26s]  One of those meltdowns
[36793.26s -> 36811.89s]  was just for fun.
[36811.89s -> 36813.89s]  Alright goodnight guys. I'll see you tomorrow. We'll do the bits tomorrow.
[36813.89s -> 36815.89s]  And the stream tomorrow is
[36815.89s -> 36817.89s]  going to be all over the place. I cannot even
[36817.89s -> 36819.89s]  describe what we're going to have. It might
[36819.89s -> 36821.89s]  just be a disaster.
[36821.89s -> 36823.89s]  But I don't think so. Should be a lot of fun.
[36823.89s -> 36825.89s]  See you tomorrow. Or see you later today.
[36825.89s -> 36827.89s]  Probably around
[36827.89s -> 36829.89s]  4 o'clock Pacific.
[36829.89s -> 36831.89s]  3 to 4. We're going to do regular time tomorrow.
[36831.89s -> 36840.96s]  Goodnight.
[36840.96s -> 36842.96s]  Try it yourself. Metal Gear
[36842.96s -> 36845.39s]  Chaos
[36845.39s -> 36847.39s]  XD
[36847.39s -> 36849.39s]  Give it a try. It was a little hard. It was a little
[36849.39s -> 36851.76s]  crazy.
[36851.76s -> 36853.76s]  Interesting money mechanic.
[36853.76s -> 36855.76s]  It was alright. I had
[36855.76s -> 36857.76s]  some fun. I did. But I didn't like a lot
[36857.76s -> 36859.76s]  of parts. But I did like some parts.
[36859.76s -> 36862.19s]  That's my review.
[36862.19s -> 36864.19s]  See you tomorrow. Have a great night.
