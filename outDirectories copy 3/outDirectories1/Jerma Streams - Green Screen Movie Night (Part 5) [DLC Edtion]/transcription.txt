[1.72s -> 13.42s]  Morning, how you doing? Remember the golden rule of this channel. If one minute has gone by and
[13.42s -> 22.28s]  Jerma does not say something, he's dead. It's a golden rule here. A full minute has passed,
[22.28s -> 32.41s]  he has not spoken. He's dead. He had to have died. It's true. Hey, how you doing everybody? Welcome
[32.41s -> 40.58s]  to the stream. We're gonna do DLC movie night part two. We have well over a hundred plus more
[40.58s -> 46.10s]  videos to watch. Told you last weekend we were going to do it exactly one full week from,
[46.10s -> 56.31s]  you know, there. Here we are. I have to apologize because of yesterday. Those of you that were
[56.31s -> 65.38s]  watching the stream yesterday, the power went out and I didn't come back for a pretty long fucking
[65.38s -> 72.73s]  time. So sorry about the power going out and I couldn't even reply to you guys. I couldn't even
[72.73s -> 79.45s]  get in there because it killed my, uh, obviously killed my modem and my router. So I was just on
[79.45s -> 86.44s]  data, like just phone data. And when the power goes out somewhere, it kills everybody's router.
[87.56s -> 94.28s]  So every single person in this entire area, all at the same time, switched to data mode
[94.28s -> 101.70s]  and called somebody. So I'm trying to like get in line in like the data queue at the tower
[101.70s -> 104.66s]  and I'm trying to tell you guys, Hey, the power, I don't even know if it went through.
[107.21s -> 113.96s]  It's like when you land in an airplane and you land and everybody ding. Okay. Every fucking phone
[113.96s -> 117.59s]  comes up in the seat. The second you land and it's like, wait, why do I have no service?
[118.15s -> 123.59s]  No, I'm trying to get through. Can you hear me? Hello? Okay. Times that by like 50,000.
[123.59s -> 138.63s]  That's not how it works. It is in my head. So that's what it is. Hmm. Never thought about it
[138.63s -> 145.19s]  like that. Yeah. As you still have to connect to something. So do you know how the infrastructure
[145.19s -> 150.68s]  works used? It doesn't, it's not a magic trick. You have to connect to the tower.
[152.01s -> 156.33s]  And if you, if like 10,000 connections go to the same time to the tower, you get, sorry,
[157.22s -> 170.89s]  you don't get to go. You get a call drop. You get the five G. What about five G? Yeah. Who knows?
[170.89s -> 187.14s]  Maybe five G will solve this problem. Frog damp moment. All right. Frog damp moment. Apparently.
[187.62s -> 196.18s]  Hold on. Let me show it. Yeah. I'm, we're going to stall a little bit because I want people to get
[196.18s -> 201.18s]  in here because people want to watch this stuff. I'm not going to be like, Hey guys, welcome to
[201.18s -> 207.74s]  stream. Oh, video. No, we're going to wait. You got to wait like a minute or two, five minutes.
[208.46s -> 221.82s]  Hurry up. It's, it would just, I just know you hurry up and sit down. You hurry up and sit down
[221.82s -> 241.37s]  for a little bit. And that like a peasant NPC. It really is. It sucks how much of a peasant NPC
[241.37s -> 255.35s]  this is. Can you get an emote? No, it already is an emote. You just jump scared.
[261.35s -> 264.63s]  All right. I'm going to move. Well, okay. Are you ready? It's been five minutes.
[265.27s -> 270.46s]  Am I going to play custom robo again? This probably, I feel like we were just starting
[270.46s -> 275.08s]  to get into it. The worst part about when your power goes out, this is the worst thing about
[275.08s -> 282.90s]  power going out. You do it. You think that your house may have exploded, right? So you're just
[282.90s -> 289.46s]  sitting there. I was mid sentence. I got monitors on. I got an AC running and all of a sudden,
[289.46s -> 294.74s]  like a light is on and you just, Oh yeah. What happened to my dad? Did something explode? No.
[294.74s -> 300.25s]  Okay. What happened? Oh, the power's gone. It's when you don't, and this is when nothing happened
[300.25s -> 306.01s]  at all. Oh wait, there's a big snowstorm. Oh, tons of rain. Something must have, oh weather. No.
[306.65s -> 321.78s]  You're just sitting around and nothing, there's nothing wrong. Okay. Yes. Every power outage is
[321.78s -> 333.78s]  personalized. Yeah. It was weird. And then you get, you start freaking out because it starts turning
[333.78s -> 338.58s]  back on and off and on and off over and over again. And then you run around like a psychopath
[339.30s -> 342.10s]  unplugging everything in your whole house. Oh fuck.
[347.16s -> 351.86s]  Fuck. I got to plug that thing. I was like, that thing's toast. And then I, I smell something. I
[351.86s -> 363.13s]  something's burning. I smell electricity. Like you're fine. I go and unplug everything. What's
[363.13s -> 370.49s]  the matter with them? That that's a power going on and off. And then you start smelling electricity.
[370.49s -> 375.67s]  Yeah. I freak out as I don't even like to use the oven. I think the oven's scary.
[376.31s -> 378.95s]  Are you really this surprised that I don't like power outages?
[380.36s -> 387.96s]  I'm like a small dog in personality. Do I know what it is? Cool. I love it.
[388.60s -> 393.48s]  Does something startle me? Do you, did you walk into the house with my favorite toy and costume?
[394.04s -> 396.68s]  Did you walk into the house with a Gumby outfit on and you're going to freak me out?
[397.40s -> 410.41s]  Anyways, let's watch the movie. The literal man child. No, I'm a little dog child. I'm a man dog.
[411.13s -> 416.23s]  I'm a dog man, but not in the sense that you like not, oh, he's like a furry. No, no, no. I'm just,
[416.23s -> 427.27s]  I'm a dog man. I have the dog brain. There you go. No, I'm not a dog. I'm not an anthropomorphic dog.
[427.27s -> 450.20s]  I am a person with a dog's brain. Clarify that. Okay. You ready? Here we go. Free. This is called,
[450.20s -> 477.75s]  this is the germ-tastic voyage. Ready? Let's go. What? The plan is one shrink ray,
[479.43s -> 498.30s]  go to the heart, kill the virus and extract. Holy shit. That was loud. Oh, my butthole. All right.
[498.30s -> 506.25s]  Okay. This is the Osmosis Jones.
[556.31s -> 560.02s]  Yeah.
[600.22s -> 610.04s]  All right. I just took like a big, hold on. I just took a big gulp. I just, I just took a
[610.04s -> 617.13s]  full sip of water and like laughed internally and just almost exploded my head. I almost just did
[617.13s -> 627.37s]  what happened in the video when it happened in the video. Look at the painting. Look at the,
[628.25s -> 633.03s]  all right. I'll go over this really quickly. I'm going to go over this very quickly.
[635.43s -> 640.39s]  I don't know how real this, look, this could be real. I don't know. But apparently this is the
[640.39s -> 645.10s]  Chuck E. Cheese stock price the day that I streamed and Chuck E. Cheese came in.
[645.10s -> 657.46s]  This is apparently real. I don't, I have nothing to do with this. I don't know. I don't, look,
[660.33s -> 675.24s]  I didn't ask for this. Coming up next is average life of car germa.
[693.40s -> 703.45s]  Is good. Only a few of these left in existence. I'm certain of that and I'm giving it to you.
[704.17s -> 712.28s]  That's right. Take it. It's yours. Don't sell it though. I don't know.
[723.45s -> 730.22s]  Hi. Hi. Hello. Yes. How are you? Black screen. Shut up. Shut up. Is this supposed to be a video?
[730.86s -> 736.46s]  This is ridiculous. You catch up to it's like this every single day. And I'm sick and tired of
[736.46s -> 741.26s]  hearing. Do you want, I don't know. Do you want it here? I can hear you all the way up here.
[741.26s -> 748.94s]  Take it. And I pay rent too. Take it. Take this. Take this from me. Take this from me. Take this
[748.94s -> 753.42s]  from me right now. Take it from me. Take it from me dude. I don't want to fucking hold it anymore.
[754.14s -> 763.69s]  Okay. That was just, I was odd. I could describe that one as odd.
[771.96s -> 776.44s]  First of all, we had 10 community subs from Minty Fox and 10 from hallowed guru.
[776.44s -> 786.76s]  Thanks both of you. Would the subs, 10 subs each. Welcome to the sub crew. Thanks guys.
[788.66s -> 794.89s]  Really appreciate it. Half life streamer. This is for the sub crew. YouTuber. Hey,
[794.89s -> 801.58s]  you're part of the sub crew now. That's right. You paid me $5. Now you're part of
[801.58s -> 805.75s]  an exclusive club. Oh, the other people that don't pay the $5. This is not allowed in.
[806.79s -> 834.65s]  No, no boys allowed. Damn it. It's like,
[850.95s -> 859.75s]  I'd like to report a accident. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, three.
[864.01s -> 907.98s]  Here we get invaded while playing dark souls. Oh, the Twitch watcher. What am I drinking? That is
[907.98s -> 913.78s]  water with a little bit of lemon. It just gives it just enough to a little bit of a kick.
[936.97s -> 941.05s]  Stay right there. Was that two? Was that you guys? Was that somebody in chat?
[941.93s -> 948.82s]  Did I just get stream sniped? That was amazing.
[953.46s -> 957.38s]  This is, wait, this is before we even had the Chuck E cheese arc on the channel.
[957.38s -> 968.44s]  Remember ruins my fit for, I want to watch that one again. At least from here. A little bit of
[968.44s -> 979.74s]  lemon. It just gives it just enough to a little bit of a kick. The best part is when you edited my
[979.74s -> 986.55s]  head going all the way backwards, I can't even see the game. Don't do it.
[989.51s -> 1000.39s]  Don't please stay right there. Was that two? Was that you guys? Was that somebody in chat?
[1004.97s -> 1014.79s]  Did I just get stream sniped? Uh, yes. The answer is always yes. Why even ask that question? All
[1014.79s -> 1022.74s]  right. Derma ruins my birthday. Oh, we stuck here forever. All right. Derma ruins my fifth birthday
[1022.74s -> 1035.18s]  and loses his job.
[1060.01s -> 1061.53s]  I'm not a real dinosaur.
[1072.31s -> 1074.55s]  Oh, please put it in. Did you get put, did you put big birthday in here?
[1106.17s -> 1113.83s]  Do it fucking right. Oh my God. So bad. Die you motherfucker.
[1121.59s -> 1141.16s]  Stupid ass. So I appreciate. All right. I appreciate the, um, I appreciate that I'm only 500 pounds
[1141.16s -> 1152.06s]  thing. What the hell was that? What the hell was that? What just, what just popped up over there?
[1166.39s -> 1182.79s]  What was that trying to capture? A real ghost on camera. Wait, did that not pop up for you?
[1192.04s -> 1219.21s]  Okay. Okay. Uh, that was the ghost. I have no idea. All right. Anyways, what was I going to say?
[1219.77s -> 1228.10s]  Who cares? I don't know what the fuck I was going to say. Let's go. This is Derma's Europe trip.
[1233.80s -> 1237.40s]  This is, this is Russia. Like I'm, I'm not going to Russia. Like I'm not going to go to Russia.
[1237.40s -> 1241.98s]  We're going to start here. Plane's going to come in. It's going to go like, this is a different
[1241.98s -> 1247.43s]  color for the plane, right? Like it's yellow. Here's where the plane comes in. This is Spain.
[1253.34s -> 1261.02s]  Wrapping around into England. We stop on England. I'm going to say we stop in London for like a
[1261.02s -> 1272.22s]  couple of days. Hey everybody. Guess where I am. Hey mom. Mom, I see it. Yeah. Wow.
[1274.68s -> 1284.92s]  And then on the way out of London, we get up Greece. Greece is right there. Here's the worst
[1284.92s -> 1291.32s]  part. I don't know where any of these places, what any of these places are. I don't even care
[1291.32s -> 1297.58s]  if I win. She's the Russian colors. Wrap around to Italy, come down to Italy all the way to the
[1297.58s -> 1299.74s]  bottom of the boot. But I want to see, I want to see the bottom of the boot. You know what I mean?
[1300.22s -> 1301.74s]  I want to piss off the bottom of the boot.
[1306.89s -> 1309.53s]  One earbud left only.
[1317.37s -> 1320.57s]  Still going to be, we're going to be the bottom of the boot in Italy for like at least a week.
[1320.57s -> 1327.83s]  So we got like two days. We got one W here, one week, all the way wrapping around into,
[1327.83s -> 1331.83s]  this is Lithuania here. I want to go to Lithuania for like at least a month. I want to spend
[1331.83s -> 1344.33s]  some time there, want to learn the color, learn the language, I guess. I was trying to say learn
[1344.33s -> 1368.10s]  the culture. Stupid. That could have been TOS. I have no idea what they said. All the way up to,
[1369.58s -> 1373.10s]  uh, I mean I have some ancestry. So I mean Ireland is a good place to stop.
[1373.82s -> 1381.46s]  And I'm going to stop in Ireland for maybe like a couple of days, like maybe two days.
[1382.26s -> 1391.48s]  Wow. He's shooting arrows. That's cool. Are there archers up there?
[1403.58s -> 1406.62s]  No, the main channel's not dead. It's in a museum.
[1407.10s -> 1412.62s]  Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's crap, aren't you? You haven't seen me in a while,
[1412.62s -> 1413.98s]  but you know what? Fuck you.
[1426.15s -> 1430.50s]  FPK's coming back next weekend, by the way. Those of you that want to join in.
[1439.77s -> 1444.97s]  Looks pretty dire for Jerma as well. Looks like he may have at least one broken bone here,
[1444.97s -> 1449.13s]  as the EMT is going to pick him up and get him on that journey. Is this my thoughts?
[1458.97s -> 1462.65s]  And then we're going to go, we're going to take off. So here we go. Like we take off from Ireland
[1462.65s -> 1468.74s]  up to here. And here is Iceland. And we're going to, this is going to be blue because it's cold.
[1468.74s -> 1470.66s]  Arming. Stopping Iceland. Arming.
[1471.46s -> 1478.34s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[1478.34s -> 1481.78s]  This is going to be a single player. Let's play. You know, I'm going to piss off,
[1481.78s -> 1485.78s]  I'm going to piss off the ice and I piss off the edge and then come all the way back around.
[1485.78s -> 1488.02s]  Of course, go all the way back around to America, which is over this way.
[1493.22s -> 1495.62s]  Back to America, flying over Russia.
[1495.62s -> 1502.36s]  I have a comment on this. That's my trip that I'm going to take.
[1503.74s -> 1509.90s]  I have a quick comment. I thought for some reason, I don't know why, don't ask me. I get it,
[1509.90s -> 1518.31s]  right? I know what this is for, but I for some reason thought that this was them censoring out
[1518.31s -> 1525.75s]  me having a huge, huge elephant. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode off the edge.
[1526.26s -> 1533.45s]  You know what I'm saying? I was like, holy shit, dude. I'm like, this is not P. This is so like,
[1533.45s -> 1543.48s]  what the hell are you implying here? This is P. I get it. P coming down the edge and then come all
[1543.48s -> 1546.60s]  the way back around. Of course, go all the way back around to America, which is over this way.
[1550.76s -> 1554.12s]  Such good sports back to America, flying over Russia.
[1558.86s -> 1560.86s]  And that's, that's my trip that I'm going to take.
[1561.34s -> 1565.13s]  All right. Dermot deserves a family of wild animals.
[1586.87s -> 1597.75s]  What the fuck? Holy shit, dude. This is by far, this is the best part right here.
[1600.55s -> 1604.60s]  You got something to say?
[1612.84s -> 1618.04s]  Dermot gets rejected on The Bachelorette. This man doesn't see it coming. He's going to
[1618.04s -> 1634.09s]  feel so blindsided. It makes me feel so terrible. Oh fuck. Oh man. This is like spilled water on
[1634.09s -> 1650.70s]  myself. This is not even. Hi. Hey. Very nice. Incredible. And I'm giving it to you. That's
[1650.70s -> 1658.44s]  right. Take it. Take this from me right now. Take it from me. Take it from me, dude. I don't want to
[1658.44s -> 1661.64s]  fucking hold it anymore. Take it from me. Take this thing out of my fucking hands before I freak
[1661.64s -> 1669.40s]  out. There's just one piece with somebody else that I am not ready to say goodbye to yet.
[1675.21s -> 1694.42s]  I think that there's just a better fit for us. Awesome. Oh, yes. A baseball one.
[1695.67s -> 1705.18s]  I can't wait to hit like two home runs. The unfortunate Jermariner's game. Jermariner's.
[1705.18s -> 1719.30s]  This is not a baseball one. I'm not hitting a grand slam. What is this? This is bullshit.
[1724.01s -> 1731.40s]  Why are they going so far? He's catching his own ball?
[1751.54s -> 1752.82s]  It's out of the park.
[1759.22s -> 1760.82s]  Picture. Oh boy.
[1789.06s -> 1792.34s]  The fuck is going on? Are they on different teams?
[1796.62s -> 1797.02s]  Yes.
[1801.80s -> 1802.12s]  Quit.
[1810.07s -> 1815.26s]  Oh shit. It's coming real fast. Yeah. Funny.
[1828.41s -> 1838.79s]  Holy shit. That was absolutely insane. I need like a minute just to process the last one.
[1840.15s -> 1849.85s]  So there's three teams. Team one was the white and then gray and then red. There was only two to
[1849.85s -> 1860.38s]  know it was the umpire. Okay. That was not. One was the ref. Can't wait to do the baseball stream.
[1860.38s -> 1868.58s]  It's going to be so much fun. I can't wait. You like my hair today? It's funny you mentioned that
[1868.58s -> 1876.02s]  because I sat down here like an hour ago and I had mustache hair. So I was like, how the,
[1876.02s -> 1882.10s]  I can't get to ever do what I wanted to. So I wet my hair and just buried the comb in and just went
[1882.10s -> 1885.54s]  over, over, over, over, over. And then I sat down and went, okay, that looks okay.
[1885.54s -> 1891.64s]  In about an hour, remember this, in like an hour or two, all roads lead back to mustache hair.
[1891.64s -> 1895.64s]  As you see, it's already forming. You see that? Do you see it forming already?
[1897.30s -> 1901.80s]  All roads lead to mustache hair. All. I'll check back in a little bit and we'll see.
[1902.44s -> 1907.62s]  This is uh, German goes to the mayor.
[1911.11s -> 1919.16s]  Excuse me. German nine eight is here. Okay. Let's see what we have here. Mayor. Michael.
[1931.16s -> 1937.67s]  So Michael, can you tell me you're a doctor of energy now? Yeah, it's a great gig and you are
[1937.67s -> 1943.03s]  not going to believe the car they just gave me. Not a LeBaron. Oh, watch the show by the way.
[1953.35s -> 1955.91s]  I mean, you probably have no idea what the fuck's going on, but I think that's
[1957.59s -> 1965.08s]  okay. So what the hell is this? So Tom goes to the mayor is the Tim and Eric's
[1965.08s -> 1971.80s]  first real show that they really had on TV. It's worth watching.
[1971.80s -> 1975.80s]  They had a lot of just random celebrity guests that would just show up. It was pretty cool.
[1975.80s -> 1981.26s]  It was really fun. All right. What is this? What is this? But German escaped.
[1981.26s -> 1983.82s]  Oh, now everybody online say that this is the best thing.
[1983.82s -> 1986.62s]  This better be transformative or I'm going to be upset about this.
[1986.62s -> 1991.10s]  It definitely feels gentle. I definitely can't wait to get home and use the lawnmower.
[1991.10s -> 2028.89s]  Is this an ad? Did we have to see this one? Oh, skip it. What? Wait, what? Why were the beginning?
[2028.89s -> 2036.50s]  Hold on. How did I get to the beginning of the playlist? What button did I press? What did I do?
[2037.14s -> 2045.64s]  What did I do? Did I press like, did I freak out and press like the start over button?
[2052.76s -> 2069.30s]  All right. We're good. We're good. Hold on. Where are we? I think that video was removed from the
[2069.30s -> 2087.58s]  playlist when I clicked on it. It's not here anymore. I'll prove it. Ready? This is germ goes
[2087.58s -> 2093.85s]  to the mayor. Okay. You ready? Germ goes to the mayor. What's right after germ goes to the mayor?
[2094.49s -> 2120.07s]  You know, all right. Anyways, I got yoinked. Oh my God. It never happened. It never existed.
[2120.07s -> 2128.63s]  Weird. All right. Well, anyways, it's lost media. This is the germ saw killer, a German 95 green
[2128.63s -> 2138.94s]  screen thriller. Okay. Here comes like probably the entire first movie trailer or three trailer.
[2138.94s -> 2143.02s]  I don't know. It's probably the whole entire movie. Here comes saw spoilers. Be aware. Be aware.
[2143.02s -> 2148.60s]  And I know what one there's like 10 of them at this point. Like it's like saying in the
[2148.60s -> 2154.39s]  Jason movies that Jason kills people. There's been like 10 of those two. Is that a spoiler
[2154.39s -> 2158.87s]  saying that like, Oh, Jason Voorhees is Mr. Voorhees and he kills people at the camp.
[2158.87s -> 2163.83s]  He does that in every movie. Guess what? And saw he's going to like carve up somebody's head.
[2164.84s -> 2170.12s]  He's going to like stuff. Somebody's brain full of like a, uh, and either brain and shit. I don't
[2170.12s -> 2187.16s]  know. Let's go. You remember what's going on with this crap. What are you? I was just kidding. Look,
[2194.30s -> 2207.86s]  finally. What is this?
[2224.76s -> 2243.10s]  Absolutely acceptable. Good question. We've just tried to get the key out of your ass.
[2243.98s -> 2247.58s]  What have your sternum or your eye, whatever I decided to put it?
[2250.41s -> 2254.73s]  No, no, no. I actually, that was me. This is a dream. This is a dream. A dream.
[2254.73s -> 2256.49s]  Make your choice. Make your choice.
[2264.14s -> 2273.06s]  You sick fuck. Oh yeah. Like, uh, five wires. That's what it is. What the fuck?
[2273.86s -> 2277.54s]  Yeah, whatever. Just put it on the top. Oh, what are you, uh, you're ordering food. Okay.
[2278.58s -> 2279.46s]  Can you get me some food?
[2282.42s -> 2288.81s]  How am I supposed to get a key out of my stomach? You don't even give me anything.
[2289.77s -> 2290.97s]  What am I supposed to do with my hands?
[2313.75s -> 2317.38s]  Woot. Yeah. It was the most work I've ever done in my life.
[2334.68s -> 2358.50s]  Oh no. Okay. Oh, just right there. Just right there.
[2363.99s -> 2368.12s]  You ran and ran and as his legs grew, he glided over the desert earth.
[2368.84s -> 2403.96s]  Oh, I feel like somebody like ordered this. Don't you feel like somebody ordered this?
[2406.36s -> 2412.04s]  Fulfilling an order. My order. So please hand them over. Thank you. Goodbye.
[2424.89s -> 2429.61s]  That was very, very good. I'm so glad somebody did this. I did like 40 minutes of soft footage
[2429.61s -> 2438.52s]  and use once. I'm going to be really, really sad if this is the only soft footage that we get.
[2438.52s -> 2446.81s]  I spent a good 40 minutes doing it. And Hey, even if, if this is the only one worth it,
[2446.81s -> 2453.11s]  worth it. It's worth it. Uh, German's unusual hobby.
[2489.19s -> 2506.04s]  Is this some kind of sick joke? Kiss my ass. That's a pretty good, pretty good view.
[2506.04s -> 2514.04s]  I don't know what this is. I'm just going with it. I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[2514.68s -> 2516.60s]  I feel like I'm a baby in a car scene.
[2526.52s -> 2532.79s]  Okay. That was interesting. Uh, this is Germoyal versus the Death Eaters.
[2533.43s -> 2538.49s]  I can already see that. Okay. I would have lost the Where's Waldo initially.
[2538.49s -> 2541.93s]  You know, something is so obvious, but you just have no idea that it's there.
[2541.93s -> 2551.88s]  This was not here in my brain. Here comes spoilers. Yes, this is going to be Harry Potter spoilers.
[2551.88s -> 2557.21s]  If you've never seen Harry Potter. Oh, by the way, the rules have been updated
[2557.21s -> 2564.14s]  for green screen footage that I'm going to show on this stream. Here comes Harry Potter,
[2564.14s -> 2571.98s]  something late game Harry Potter, by the way. I'm, I'm assuming because they're not eight,
[2571.98s -> 2576.14s]  right? That's how you tell when you're going to get a real deep Harry Potter spoiler.
[2576.14s -> 2583.06s]  How old is he? Okay. He's like, he's like 18 or 19 in this picture. That's deep,
[2583.06s -> 2602.20s]  late game Harry Potter spoilers. I've had all the essentials packed for days.
[2603.08s -> 2606.60s]  Just in case. By the way, these jeans, not my favorite.
[2617.70s -> 2619.45s]  Harry, hurry.
[2624.63s -> 2627.99s]  I just, I just hit him right in the skull. I just cracked his skull.
[2633.85s -> 2640.54s]  Oh no, my cloak. Quick, into the castle. Get the lights.
[2652.39s -> 2654.92s]  He was on the astronomy tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.
[2656.76s -> 2660.68s]  This is dollar hop. I reckon this is for the water posters. Disgusting.
[2662.25s -> 2666.97s]  So what are we going to do with you, eh? Kill us if we turn around, won't you?
[2666.97s -> 2671.05s]  We killed them the moment we were here. Harry, Harry, it's time.
[2671.05s -> 2673.37s]  Give me some leverage here. How would you feel then?
[2673.37s -> 2677.13s]  Thank you. On the count of three. It's better we wipe their memories.
[2677.13s -> 2679.21s]  One. You're the boss.
[2679.37s -> 2681.93s]  Two. Three.
[2684.57s -> 2689.13s]  You're the best of spells. What am I even doing here?
[2693.50s -> 2699.82s]  It's G to five. I'm not even here. Other words they say.
[2702.82s -> 2711.27s]  Oh my God. Damn it. My fucking head hurts. I hit him in his skull. Oh, okay.
[2711.91s -> 2727.56s]  This is German on the run. FMV game parody. Water out of the toilet.
[2732.14s -> 2737.58s]  After a long day of work, Yereminin85 tried to rest a bit. When suddenly.
[2764.39s -> 2764.87s]  Delete.
[2785.35s -> 2793.32s]  Uh oh. I thought my computer crashed. This is my actual background.
[2793.32s -> 2811.06s]  I thought that everything crashed. That was crazy. Wait, it's round two. All right.
[2811.06s -> 2819.05s]  You got to get it right this time though. The giant enemy.
[2819.05s -> 2819.77s]  Russian German.
[2825.62s -> 2827.54s]  The giant enemy. Russian German.
[2829.54s -> 2845.02s]  What's even going on? We haven't seen very many Russian German either.
[2845.66s -> 2857.75s]  I did that for a while. All right. Come on. Come on. Oh wow.
[2857.75s -> 2861.53s]  I don't want to hear any. All right. This is German.
[2861.53s -> 2866.18s]  The German family goes to McDonald's. Another McDonald's one.
[2867.90s -> 2870.54s]  This is a, this is a long one. Let's see.
[2871.24s -> 2874.92s]  And I don't want to hear any. Hey, I want to go to McDonald's.
[2876.12s -> 2881.62s]  I want to go to McDonald's. I want to go to Wendy's too.
[2882.34s -> 2886.94s]  Buckle up. Mom, I want to go to both.
[2888.65s -> 2891.67s]  Mom, McDonald's. Shit, nice smoothie.
[2891.67s -> 2892.71s]  Nice smoothie. Shit.
[2895.53s -> 2899.29s]  Only McDonald's. We're a McDonald's family for Christ's sake.
[2899.29s -> 2910.60s]  We only eat McDonald's. Dad, Jimmy, and mom.
[2926.41s -> 2927.77s]  Wait, why are we changing cars?
[2948.46s -> 2949.82s]  Why are there so many of us?
[2970.14s -> 2974.68s]  Sunny day outside. Safe to me.
[2978.79s -> 2983.10s]  I'm full. And I don't want to hear anybody talking.
[2986.44s -> 2988.36s]  Go ahead and get out of the way. Leave your dear old dad here.
[2988.36s -> 2995.70s]  Let me just relax. Nice smoothie.
[2995.70s -> 2996.98s]  Nice and smooth. Smooth.
[3007.70s -> 3011.62s]  I know. I love left-hand turns. Maybe I should try going right.
[3012.26s -> 3015.38s]  But I can't. I've always gone left.
[3016.02s -> 3018.71s]  I was going a big square. I can't.
[3018.71s -> 3023.43s]  Okay, this time, this time, you can do it. You can go right.
[3023.43s -> 3026.73s]  Hey, fellas, I'm going to go right.
[3034.60s -> 3049.58s]  Are they okay? I think I'm the Superman.
[3054.26s -> 3059.11s]  You okay? Hey, you all right in there?
[3059.83s -> 3071.05s]  Hello, who's this? Yes, yeah, I'd like to report an accident.
[3071.53s -> 3078.09s]  Sorry. Yeah, I'm on 12345678910th Street.
[3081.78s -> 3086.74s]  I punched a car and it crushed me. I think I'm at a supercar accident.
[3086.74s -> 3092.26s]  No, don't tell the government about that.
[3102.30s -> 3107.56s]  That was really unfunny. I really wish I knew how to delete things off that thing.
[3107.56s -> 3110.76s]  That was terrible. Don't use that. Don't use any of that.
[3110.76s -> 3114.68s]  Don't even bother. Is this another actor?
[3116.92s -> 3122.84s]  Was that an actor? A self-insert?
[3126.20s -> 3130.94s]  Was it? Oh, come on.
[3130.94s -> 3132.86s]  What did I say? Rule? What was rule one?
[3132.86s -> 3135.99s]  What was the number one rule? I said it earlier.
[3135.99s -> 3139.59s]  What was it? I don't remember what the number one rule is.
[3139.59s -> 3141.35s]  I said it like an hour ago. What is it?
[3141.35s -> 3146.52s]  You didn't say? Yeah, I talked about like the rule.
[3146.52s -> 3148.28s]  Yeah, okay. No, no.
[3149.00s -> 3153.22s]  You actually didn't say what the number one rule was.
[3153.78s -> 3159.61s]  I did. I talked about the number one thing.
[3160.57s -> 3162.95s]  All right. Well, the number two thing is,
[3162.95s -> 3167.74s]  you're not allowed to be a better actor than me on my own stream.
[3167.74s -> 3169.74s]  You said there are new rules. Oh, right.
[3169.74s -> 3173.11s]  Okay. Well, rule two, you're not allowed to be a better actor than me.
[3173.11s -> 3175.77s]  Since its inception, hundreds of TV...
[3175.77s -> 3179.53s]  Okay, this is the Adventures of Cartwheel, Germa, and Orange Froglodyte.
[3180.09s -> 3183.35s]  Mystery of the Fun Fair. Wait.
[3185.16s -> 3187.64s]  Is this a spin-off or is this a copy of the show?
[3192.42s -> 3194.42s]  Germa and Purple Alien. This is a spin-off.
[3195.22s -> 3197.78s]  Cartwheel, Germa, and Orange Froglodyte.
[3197.78s -> 3201.22s]  This is a fine fighting duo against a briefly athletic man named Kaden.
[3201.22s -> 3203.46s]  This was canned so badly by the critics.
[3204.66s -> 3206.78s]  It's a Purple Alien spin-off.
[3207.82s -> 3209.42s]  It is. What is it? The same guy?
[3215.19s -> 3224.94s]  Pog. Did that person stem a new genre?
[3254.49s -> 3257.45s]  They couldn't talk.
[3257.53s -> 3258.03s]  Fuck.
[3270.54s -> 3271.50s]  Unfair time.
[3288.12s -> 3288.84s]  God damn it.
[3301.38s -> 3301.88s]  Watch out.
[3332.94s -> 3336.18s]  Gamer. The Mega Prize.
[3344.34s -> 3364.54s]  Be continued after these messages.
[3364.54s -> 3365.47s]  Uh oh.
[3367.78s -> 3376.74s]  It was actually... Okay.
[3377.54s -> 3379.62s]  We should watch the whole thing apparently.
[3380.58s -> 3381.08s]  Part two.
[3381.86s -> 3383.62s]  Mystery of the Fun Fair.
[3383.62s -> 3387.78s]  Let's just play an ad.
[3390.02s -> 3395.91s]  What is it? No more sequels.
[3395.91s -> 3397.19s]  No more sequels.
[3398.55s -> 3399.43s]  We want remakes.
[3400.39s -> 3405.59s]  I want a remake of Germa...
[3405.59s -> 3406.87s]  Germa is short.
[3406.87s -> 3407.75s]  He's 5'2".
[3479.59s -> 3492.42s]  It's too many.
[3495.56s -> 3496.84s]  Uh oh. You fucked with the toy.
[3542.71s -> 3543.21s]  Nice.
[3543.51s -> 3573.50s]  We're gonna get a final battle?
[3594.17s -> 3594.67s]  No.
[3595.21s -> 3599.54s]  But he got away.
[3599.54s -> 3601.06s]  That's not good. That has to be a part three.
[3611.48s -> 3612.52s]  It's up in the event.
[3613.08s -> 3632.15s]  Is it the end?
[3632.15s -> 3633.11s]  After credit scene.
[3633.11s -> 3633.61s]  Has to be.
[3647.32s -> 3647.88s]  But wait a minute.
[3647.88s -> 3649.56s]  What? But the villain got away with it.
[3649.56s -> 3650.44s]  It's gonna be a part three.
[3651.08s -> 3651.88s]  It'll be a sequel.
[3652.60s -> 3659.16s]  Man, I really can't wait for green Germa.
[3659.16s -> 3660.44s]  And crawling Germa.
[3665.10s -> 3666.78s]  That's gonna be great when we see that one.
[3673.62s -> 3676.58s]  Green Cucumber and crawling Germa.
[3689.29s -> 3690.33s]  I'm going to kill you.
[3705.99s -> 3706.49s]  No.
[3721.24s -> 3723.24s]  One, two, three, break it down.
[3723.24s -> 3725.24s]  Get busy.
[3725.24s -> 3728.95s]  Get busy.
[3728.95s -> 3730.95s]  Get busy.
[3730.95s -> 3733.90s]  You think I can do that, didn't you?
[3733.90s -> 3735.90s]  You think I can do that, didn't you?
[3735.90s -> 3737.90s]  One, two, three, kick it.
[3737.90s -> 3742.06s]  One, two, three, kick it.
[3742.06s -> 3744.47s]  One, two, three, kick it.
[3744.47s -> 3746.43s]  What?
[3746.43s -> 3749.05s]  I'm sorry.
[3749.05s -> 3755.45s]  Following motion picture,
[3755.45s -> 3757.45s]  Yopla's topsy turvy
[3757.45s -> 3759.76s]  has been approved by someone without any authority to do so.
[3760.72s -> 3763.52s]  Whose resemblance to anyone living or dead is merely a coincidence.
[3763.52s -> 3770.36s]  It's supposed to be...
[3770.36s -> 3772.28s]  All right, here we go.
[3772.28s -> 3774.44s]  Yopla's topsy turvy.
[3774.44s -> 3775.32s]  Germa edition.
[3775.88s -> 3777.07s]  This is not...
[3777.07s -> 3777.95s]  It's topless.
[3777.95s -> 3779.47s]  It's very clearly not a T.
[3780.27s -> 3784.65s]  Okay, that...
[3784.65s -> 3785.29s]  No, it's not like...
[3785.29s -> 3786.89s]  I don't have like boobs or anything.
[3786.89s -> 3787.37s]  It's all right.
[3787.37s -> 3787.87s]  Ready?
[3791.20s -> 3793.36s]  T-pants production.
[3832.94s -> 3836.65s]  What is he driving?
[3836.65s -> 3837.21s]  A chair?
[3858.97s -> 3859.77s]  Wait, what was that?
[3860.49s -> 3871.53s]  What the hell is happening in this video?
[3880.40s -> 3881.20s]  Your movie.
[3888.70s -> 3890.38s]  From the movies,
[3890.38s -> 3892.70s]  you did a shot-for-shot remake.
[3893.90s -> 3904.11s]  It's a shot-for-shot remake.
[3925.50s -> 3925.90s]  Sorry.
[3927.50s -> 3930.25s]  What do you want me to do so I put my arms on my sides?
[3932.97s -> 3943.53s]  Transformers.
[3943.53s -> 3944.73s]  Transform into...
[3944.73s -> 3945.69s]  Object of flight.
[3947.61s -> 3948.11s]  Ow!
[3949.21s -> 3949.71s]  Ow!
[3950.41s -> 3950.91s]  Ow!
[3951.53s -> 3952.97s]  My fucking bones!
[3952.97s -> 3953.47s]  Ow!
[3954.73s -> 3961.90s]  We're not just psychoporate.
[3962.94s -> 3978.81s]  That's Baby Joker.
[3983.77s -> 3984.41s]  Okay.
[3984.41s -> 3986.33s]  I had no idea what was going on.
[3987.05s -> 3990.00s]  Until about a minute and 45 seconds ago.
[3990.72s -> 3997.07s]  Guys, I even thought that this person...
[3998.11s -> 3998.99s]  Oh, topless.
[3999.71s -> 4000.59s]  Yes, right.
[4001.39s -> 4002.99s]  This is...
[4002.99s -> 4004.35s]  I made this movie.
[4004.91s -> 4006.03s]  How long ago was that, though?
[4006.59s -> 4009.55s]  If it was more than a year ago, it doesn't exist.
[4009.55s -> 4010.11s]  In my brain.
[4012.91s -> 4014.27s]  Like three, five years ago.
[4014.27s -> 4014.91s]  Well, yeah.
[4014.91s -> 4015.31s]  Oh, yeah.
[4018.32s -> 4019.36s]  Watch the original one.
[4020.00s -> 4021.63s]  All right.
[4021.63s -> 4022.91s]  Yeah, hold on.
[4022.91s -> 4023.87s]  Let's watch the original.
[4023.87s -> 4024.99s]  I'm actually curious about this.
[4025.63s -> 4036.64s]  Let's see how close...
[4036.64s -> 4037.44s]  How correct this was.
[4043.37s -> 4044.33s]  Enjoy it.
[4044.33s -> 4046.04s]  Do it side by side.
[4046.76s -> 4047.26s]  I...
[4050.48s -> 4052.86s]  I'm not going to be able to cue that up.
[4053.58s -> 4057.32s]  All right.
[4057.32s -> 4057.64s]  Hold on.
[4057.64s -> 4058.12s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[4058.12s -> 4058.36s]  Let me...
[4061.26s -> 4062.22s]  I'll put them side by side.
[4062.22s -> 4062.30s]  All right.
[4062.30s -> 4062.62s]  Hold on.
[4062.62s -> 4063.50s]  I'll put them side by side.
[4064.30s -> 4066.72s]  Are they timed correctly, though?
[4066.72s -> 4067.20s]  The beginning?
[4068.16s -> 4069.13s]  Okay.
[4069.13s -> 4069.53s]  Hold on.
[4069.53s -> 4070.73s]  Let me get this right.
[4070.73s -> 4072.12s]  I'll put them side by side.
[4092.38s -> 4094.70s]  All right.
[4094.70s -> 4095.02s]  You know what?
[4095.02s -> 4095.58s]  Let me do this.
[4096.70s -> 4097.98s]  It's not shot for shot.
[4097.98s -> 4098.94s]  Oh, it's not.
[4098.94s -> 4099.98s]  It's not shot for shot.
[4102.38s -> 4103.82s]  Oh, it's not shot for shot.
[4103.82s -> 4104.30s]  Okay.
[4104.30s -> 4104.62s]  All right.
[4104.62s -> 4104.94s]  All right.
[4104.94s -> 4105.18s]  All right.
[4105.18s -> 4105.34s]  All right.
[4105.34s -> 4105.82s]  We'll just watch...
[4105.82s -> 4106.70s]  We'll watch the original.
[4108.27s -> 4108.75s]  Oh, right.
[4108.75s -> 4108.91s]  Yeah.
[4108.91s -> 4114.25s]  It's not cued up correctly.
[4114.25s -> 4114.81s]  On your own...
[4114.81s -> 4115.61s]  On your own time.
[4116.25s -> 4116.89s]  All right.
[4116.89s -> 4117.29s]  Let's go.
[4121.52s -> 4122.72s]  Not shot for shot.
[4122.72s -> 4123.60s]  Oh, man.
[4129.48s -> 4129.88s]  I'm curious.
[4129.88s -> 4130.36s]  Let's watch it.
[4138.33s -> 4139.21s]  Enjoy it.
[4139.21s -> 4141.64s]  When are you going to get the playlist?
[4141.64s -> 4142.60s]  After the...
[4142.60s -> 4143.72s]  At the end of their stream today.
[4200.49s -> 4200.97s]  Chair.
[4200.97s -> 4201.53s]  Okay.
[4201.53s -> 4202.41s]  I remember the chair.
[4241.15s -> 4241.87s]  That was accurate.
[4254.04s -> 4255.00s]  Dearly beloved,
[4255.72s -> 4257.08s]  we are gathered here today
[4257.88s -> 4259.95s]  to incorporate
[4260.67s -> 4263.31s]  our final testament to this man,
[4263.31s -> 4266.19s]  this wonderful man that lies before us.
[4267.23s -> 4268.67s]  His name was Harold Slunk
[4269.71s -> 4270.99s]  and he was my best friend.
[4271.87s -> 4275.69s]  And can somebody turn that fucking music off, please?
[4277.98s -> 4278.46s]  Thank you.
[4279.34s -> 4280.91s]  As I was saying,
[4280.91s -> 4282.43s]  Harold was a good friend of mine.
[4282.43s -> 4282.99s]  Lost my heart,
[4282.99s -> 4284.51s]  hope, and I a promise that's real.
[4284.51s -> 4288.35s]  And I'm just going to miss him so fucking much.
[4288.35s -> 4289.87s]  I'm going to miss him more than anything.
[4291.21s -> 4292.41s]  And by the way,
[4292.97s -> 4295.77s]  after this, I'll see you at Fridays for two set wings.
[4298.84s -> 4300.75s]  That was the joke.
[4300.75s -> 4302.51s]  This is fucking terrible.
[4302.51s -> 4304.43s]  This is the worst one ever.
[4304.43s -> 4305.07s]  It really kind of was.
[4306.59s -> 4313.08s]  That was the worst fucking one.
[4313.64s -> 4318.78s]  That was probably the worst one.
[4319.34s -> 4322.94s]  Moving on.
[4324.00s -> 4327.52s]  Because we do have a shitload more videos to watch.
[4328.08s -> 4331.77s]  Up next.
[4332.48s -> 4335.04s]  Irma says hello in the fight.
[4335.04s -> 4337.16s]  I don't know what the fight is.
[4339.28s -> 4340.08s]  Ever seen it?
[4340.08s -> 4340.48s]  Don't know.
[4343.18s -> 4350.46s]  Spoilers.
[4350.46s -> 4351.58s]  Spoilers with the fight.
[4352.30s -> 4352.70s]  Got it.
[4352.70s -> 4353.58s]  Spoilers with the fight.
[4382.22s -> 4382.94s]  I was scooped.
[4384.30s -> 4385.02s]  I was scooped.
[4385.02s -> 4385.74s]  I almost did.
[4395.80s -> 4396.68s]  Keying.
[4396.68s -> 4397.48s]  Turkey arms.
[4412.96s -> 4413.76s]  Balloon.
[4413.76s -> 4419.55s]  Fuck off.
[4425.10s -> 4425.60s]  Okay.
[4436.45s -> 4437.25s]  All right, so he won.
[4438.05s -> 4438.85s]  Is there more?
[4438.85s -> 4439.41s]  There's more.
[4439.41s -> 4440.13s]  I was 18.
[4441.33s -> 4444.45s]  I found myself in the high school dance.
[4446.13s -> 4447.17s]  Nervous for all of us.
[4447.89s -> 4449.47s]  Except on this particular day.
[4455.73s -> 4457.01s]  He didn't do anything.
[4461.33s -> 4463.73s]  That is, I believe what we just watched is
[4463.73s -> 4465.09s]  shit, gotta make deadline.
[4465.73s -> 4467.01s]  Gotta hit export.
[4467.01s -> 4470.58s]  It was good though.
[4474.88s -> 4475.38s]  Yeah.
[4476.08s -> 4477.90s]  I'm really enjoying the school dance.
[4478.54s -> 4490.54s]  Should I come a little closer?
[4490.62s -> 4492.50s]  Wait, what am I doing?
[4493.71s -> 4494.67s]  Am I choking?
[4494.67s -> 4496.19s]  So do you have a math homework?
[4496.19s -> 4497.31s]  Do you have to do this one?
[4497.31s -> 4500.99s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[4500.99s -> 4506.02s]  Yeah, I have to do this because she's the worst.
[4510.90s -> 4512.50s]  Entering the ring first.
[4513.46s -> 4518.30s]  We have the bad boy, Joey Jamila.
[4519.18s -> 4520.06s]  Wait, what is this?
[4520.78s -> 4527.46s]  This is another, wait, this is a bunch of actors.
[4527.46s -> 4528.26s]  This is all actors?
[4529.66s -> 4530.70s]  And his opponent.
[4531.73s -> 4532.69s]  Entering the ring.
[4532.69s -> 4538.05s]  From Boston, Massachusetts, Jerma985.
[4538.05s -> 4543.25s]  You're the one I'm gonna get.
[4553.52s -> 4557.25s]  This is the versus the invisible man.
[4557.25s -> 4558.77s]  Okay, yes, yes, I know this.
[4558.77s -> 4560.21s]  I've seen this.
[4560.21s -> 4566.26s]  I didn't want to, I didn't want to knock this, but I did.
[4567.78s -> 4568.66s]  That's my little type.
[4572.86s -> 4574.14s]  You can't do this to me.
[4574.14s -> 4575.42s]  Ow, do you have any idea who I am?
[4576.06s -> 4577.66s]  Yeah, Jerma985, look me up.
[4578.78s -> 4580.78s]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[4609.15s -> 4609.79s]  Wait.
[4609.79s -> 4610.59s]  Joey Jamila.
[4613.95s -> 4614.43s]  Don't move.
[4616.29s -> 4616.93s]  It's hard, man.
[4620.21s -> 4620.93s]  He's up top.
[4625.81s -> 4626.61s]  Oh, he's rolled up.
[4627.73s -> 4636.22s]  And your winner, the challenger, Jerma985.
[4636.22s -> 4637.98s]  That's the song, that's the song.
[4637.98s -> 4639.58s]  I don't believe in babies.
[4639.58s -> 4641.18s]  That's what babies do.
[4641.18s -> 4643.58s]  Oh, and Jerma, go for it, come on, cheap shots.
[4643.58s -> 4645.74s]  All right, put the camera, get this guy on the ring.
[4646.38s -> 4647.26s]  Oh my God.
[4648.14s -> 4649.90s]  Hold on, I want to see the roll up again.
[4649.90s -> 4650.70s]  Entering the.
[4652.94s -> 4654.64s]  That roll up is so good.
[4660.77s -> 4661.57s]  Oh, he's rolled up.
[4668.53s -> 4669.49s]  Babies do that.
[4669.49s -> 4670.53s]  Okay, that was awesome.
[4671.49s -> 4675.68s]  Jerma sits down for dinner with his family.
[4682.75s -> 4683.79s]  We saw this already.
[4692.14s -> 4693.74s]  No, did we see this exact one?
[4694.30s -> 4697.28s]  I don't think we saw this one.
[4700.46s -> 4717.81s]  Okay, yeah, so what do we have tonight?
[4717.81s -> 4718.45s]  Look at that.
[4719.73s -> 4720.61s]  Delicious.
[4722.78s -> 4726.06s]  Potatoes, mashed potatoes and gravy.
[4726.86s -> 4728.59s]  You've about done yourself.
[4730.46s -> 4733.60s]  You pass the salt.
[4737.18s -> 4738.62s]  Don't throw it over here.
[4738.62s -> 4740.38s]  What about just a sicko?
[4744.75s -> 4748.30s]  Okay, so how was your day, son?
[4752.99s -> 4756.98s]  Wow, in class.
[4757.95s -> 4761.65s]  That's unbelievable, Susie.
[4765.12s -> 4768.64s]  My kids, my kids are the smartest, straight A's.
[4768.64s -> 4772.66s]  He's like, this is sad.
[4773.70s -> 4776.02s]  That's a little tough, I think, a little tough.
[4776.02s -> 4777.38s]  A little overdone, but it's still good.
[4777.94s -> 4784.05s]  This is scary and sad and horrible.
[4784.05s -> 4785.73s]  Well, my day was pretty interesting.
[4787.25s -> 4787.89s]  I got fired.
[4788.86s -> 4791.42s]  I can't even like watch it, it's so fucked up.
[4795.46s -> 4799.18s]  Yep, and then I got hired.
[4804.43s -> 4805.07s]  Oh my God.
[4805.07s -> 4805.79s]  I had a company next door.
[4806.83s -> 4808.35s]  Just walked out, brought my briefcase in.
[4809.23s -> 4810.91s]  This is the TLT guy, perfect.
[4810.91s -> 4811.87s]  Oh my God, I'm so happy.
[4814.48s -> 4829.46s]  Ah, hold on, I need to take a second.
[4829.46s -> 4829.94s]  That hurt.
[4831.26s -> 4832.78s]  Oh, that's like scared me.
[4835.14s -> 4839.90s]  Oh, we're not even halfway.
[4843.66s -> 4847.14s]  All right, all right, let's go again.
[4848.46s -> 4850.78s]  The timing was perfect on that too, by the way.
[4850.78s -> 4855.90s]  Like very stellar editing here.
[4855.90s -> 4857.58s]  Well, my day was pretty interesting.
[4858.14s -> 4859.74s]  I got fired.
[4860.54s -> 4877.68s]  Yep, and then I got hired by the company next door.
[4878.64s -> 4880.16s]  Just walked out, brought my briefcase in.
[4881.12s -> 4882.80s]  This is the TLT guy, perfect.
[4882.80s -> 4884.24s]  Oh my God, I'm so happy.
[4884.24s -> 4904.59s]  What is this?
[4905.98s -> 4907.10s]  What is this?
[4908.54s -> 4909.10s]  What?
[4909.10s -> 4912.62s]  Oh, boy.
[4912.62s -> 4916.14s]  Oh no, so loud.
[4916.14s -> 4917.50s]  Shut up, shut up.
[4917.50s -> 4919.66s]  Get out, go back, back into the scene, come on.
[4920.38s -> 4931.10s]  So I heard, who's you got to fight today, son?
[4936.40s -> 4936.72s]  Okay.
[4939.78s -> 4941.10s]  Let me tell you something.
[4942.42s -> 4944.42s]  If you can do not do it diplomatically,
[4945.06s -> 4946.42s]  then you shouldn't be doing it at all.
[4946.82s -> 4949.86s]  We only eat McDonald's.
[4949.86s -> 4951.78s]  I want to go to McDonald's.
[4952.42s -> 4957.38s]  Gravy, potatoes, meat, cheese, onions, tomatoes, peppers.
[4957.38s -> 4960.26s]  Well, I mean, it's kind of insane.
[4960.26s -> 4962.50s]  I heard that you punched him.
[4963.30s -> 4963.70s]  Did you?
[4963.70s -> 4964.42s]  You punched him?
[4964.42s -> 4965.62s]  You punched him in the face?
[4966.42s -> 4967.54s]  My son doesn't do that.
[4968.34s -> 4969.54s]  Diplomacy only.
[4970.72s -> 4972.24s]  You know how much trouble I could get in?
[4975.52s -> 4977.76s]  I'm in the gosh darn.
[4979.76s -> 4980.32s]  I'm getting heated here.
[4981.92s -> 4986.14s]  My son, a United States representative.
[4988.03s -> 4989.23s]  I'm your dad.
[4989.23s -> 4990.67s]  I'm the representative, not you.
[4990.67s -> 4993.50s]  That would be strange now, wouldn't it?
[4993.50s -> 4994.94s]  You got to do things diplomatically.
[4995.66s -> 4996.38s]  Or you're grounded.
[4996.38s -> 4997.02s]  No, you know what?
[4998.30s -> 4998.94s]  I'll handle it.
[4999.58s -> 5000.46s]  You are grounded.
[5001.34s -> 5002.06s]  You're grounded.
[5002.62s -> 5003.98s]  We don't fight in this family.
[5006.51s -> 5007.95s]  Eat your gosh darn.
[5009.07s -> 5011.07s]  I keep saying that stuff and I don't want to.
[5017.50s -> 5018.94s]  Now listen, family.
[5019.50s -> 5020.22s]  If we could join hands.
[5023.41s -> 5023.81s]  No?
[5023.81s -> 5024.45s]  Okay.
[5024.45s -> 5039.02s]  Is that it?
[5040.37s -> 5040.93s]  Wait, what?
[5048.42s -> 5052.66s]  Somebody said, this is a scene you'd see at the Oscars for a nominee.
[5054.24s -> 5055.44s]  Yeah, it kind of is, isn't it?
[5057.66s -> 5059.18s]  Happy birthday.
[5059.18s -> 5060.22s]  Oh, God.
[5063.66s -> 5064.78s]  All chairs turn.
[5068.32s -> 5069.28s]  I already know.
[5069.28s -> 5070.32s]  I've seen the whole video.
[5070.32s -> 5072.32s]  I don't even need to see it, but I'm still laughing about it.
[5072.32s -> 5077.76s]  Happy birthday to you.
[5077.76s -> 5078.64s]  Everybody, come on.
[5079.36s -> 5085.01s]  Happy birthday to you.
[5085.01s -> 5090.38s]  Happy birthday, dear.
[5097.09s -> 5099.10s]  Birthday.
[5105.17s -> 5107.17s]  God damn it, it was so close.
[5107.17s -> 5109.31s]  It was so close.
[5109.87s -> 5116.53s]  I was spooked.
[5117.90s -> 5118.62s]  I was spooked.
[5118.62s -> 5119.66s]  I almost did.
[5119.66s -> 5131.94s]  This thing we have ever had on the show.
[5131.94s -> 5134.18s]  The blood is rushing through my entire body.
[5134.98s -> 5136.38s]  Who are you?
[5137.02s -> 5137.74s]  What's your name?
[5137.98s -> 5146.94s]  I think a collective, it was a whole performance.
[5146.94s -> 5148.94s]  It was like completely captivating.
[5148.94s -> 5150.70s]  I believed everything you were doing.
[5150.70s -> 5153.18s]  It was like, it was a real trance.
[5153.18s -> 5154.62s]  I'm so excited.
[5154.62s -> 5157.66s]  You have to be on my team.
[5158.70s -> 5163.02s]  Really important not to like discredit too is that you're a performer.
[5163.02s -> 5165.26s]  You're like, you're not just hiding behind anything.
[5165.26s -> 5168.70s]  Like you were moving, you were singing, you're a great vocalist.
[5168.94s -> 5173.31s]  Don't break my heart.
[5173.31s -> 5174.99s]  That'll be $200.
[5176.93s -> 5179.41s]  Holy shit.
[5180.45s -> 5182.14s]  Wait a minute.
[5182.14s -> 5185.98s]  What does this say at the top of the screen?
[5186.78s -> 5188.38s]  Quick, German, green alien.
[5191.89s -> 5192.37s]  Wait, what?
[5194.48s -> 5196.16s]  No, wait, hold on a second.
[5196.16s -> 5199.71s]  I thought that was this German.
[5199.71s -> 5205.06s]  This is, wait, this is another one.
[5205.06s -> 5205.46s]  This is the one.
[5205.46s -> 5206.66s]  What am I just talking about this?
[5207.46s -> 5214.22s]  Shit dick.
[5214.22s -> 5217.18s]  Quick, German and green alien, right?
[5218.80s -> 5219.44s]  Bitch.
[5219.44s -> 5220.32s]  It's time to get punished.
[5221.82s -> 5223.02s]  Oh, excuse me.
[5223.02s -> 5224.70s]  Why are there so many knockoffs?
[5224.70s -> 5226.38s]  Oh, excuse me.
[5226.38s -> 5226.86s]  Hold on.
[5226.86s -> 5227.90s]  I have to diarrhea.
[5230.78s -> 5232.14s]  Kill him, kill him, kill.
[5233.18s -> 5233.98s]  Holy shit.
[5233.98s -> 5234.78s]  I can't believe it.
[5236.62s -> 5238.46s]  I did not see this list beforehand, guys.
[5238.46s -> 5238.94s]  I swear.
[5251.25s -> 5251.89s]  We got him.
[5252.69s -> 5254.37s]  Hey, hey, what's your opinion on politics?
[5265.76s -> 5267.20s]  I was doing something.
[5267.84s -> 5286.51s]  The bootlegs are fighting each other.
[5286.51s -> 5287.07s]  Oh, no.
[5287.07s -> 5293.87s]  I have to see a six-way tornado tag tournament
[5293.87s -> 5297.95s]  between all the green alien purple alien knockoffs.
[5297.95s -> 5304.21s]  Excuse me.
[5304.21s -> 5306.80s]  What's going on?
[5306.80s -> 5308.96s]  I just popped my pants.
[5319.39s -> 5321.26s]  Breaking news.
[5321.26s -> 5322.94s]  BDGerma is dead.
[5324.80s -> 5327.52s]  The sidekick red alien listed as missing.
[5328.24s -> 5331.87s]  How smelling green footprints have been discovered
[5331.87s -> 5332.91s]  near the crime scene.
[5333.63s -> 5338.00s]  The culprit is believed to be serial killer green alien.
[5339.04s -> 5341.20s]  Now on the FBI's most wanted list
[5341.20s -> 5343.28s]  for the murder of master Kit Fisto.
[5344.08s -> 5350.53s]  I just haven't get it right.
[5350.53s -> 5353.42s]  I'm going to calm down and stab you in the fucking head.
[5356.10s -> 5356.74s]  Hey, shh.
[5356.74s -> 5357.30s]  Don't tell him.
[5357.30s -> 5358.02s]  Hey, don't tell him.
[5362.77s -> 5365.86s]  Why is everything shitting?
[5367.14s -> 5372.27s]  He's a Reddit user.
[5372.99s -> 5374.59s]  Die, you motherfucker.
[5375.63s -> 5388.14s]  Is this candid?
[5388.14s -> 5389.26s]  I don't know, man.
[5389.26s -> 5389.90s]  Everyone quiet.
[5389.90s -> 5394.30s]  This is soft footage.
[5394.30s -> 5396.38s]  Oh, you got me with the cliffhanger.
[5396.38s -> 5397.66s]  Good job with that cliffhanger.
[5397.66s -> 5398.30s]  Now I'm interested.
[5401.15s -> 5402.59s]  Derma attacks the Death Star.
[5413.57s -> 5414.29s]  Star Wars.
[5414.29s -> 5414.79s]  Yes.
[5416.29s -> 5417.33s]  Red 3, standing by.
[5418.93s -> 5419.49s]  Where am I?
[5421.25s -> 5422.69s]  Red 11, standing by.
[5422.69s -> 5423.97s]  Red 5, standing by.
[5425.73s -> 5427.33s]  Luck has bought us an attack position.
[5430.29s -> 5434.05s]  We're passing through the magnetic field.
[5434.05s -> 5435.09s]  Hold tight.
[5435.09s -> 5437.41s]  Move your deflectors on double front.
[5439.89s -> 5442.64s]  He's going to come back and bite me.
[5442.64s -> 5444.24s]  Press the shutter at two.
[5444.24s -> 5445.66s]  Accelerate to speed.
[5447.66s -> 5458.34s]  Cross the axis and try and draw their fire.
[5461.04s -> 5462.40s]  I love left-hand turns.
[5464.16s -> 5467.14s]  It's the only thing I've said.
[5468.26s -> 5486.82s]  It's not going too good over here.
[5488.26s -> 5489.54s]  Maybe I should try going right.
[5491.10s -> 5492.06s]  I'm going to go right.
[5493.90s -> 5497.71s]  No, you can't even get.
[5499.30s -> 5500.58s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5501.70s -> 5505.15s]  Boogers.
[5505.15s -> 5507.36s]  Pee break.
[5507.36s -> 5508.40s]  All right, we're going to take a pee break.
[5508.40s -> 5509.36s]  We'll come back.
[5509.36s -> 5513.95s]  Go take a pee break.
[5514.59s -> 5515.31s]  First pee break.
[5517.04s -> 5519.50s]  See you in two or three minutes.
[5520.06s -> 5732.03s]  Okay, I have returned.
[5732.03s -> 5733.31s]  Got some water.
[5735.34s -> 5737.58s]  I want to say thanks to Wink Dinker
[5738.46s -> 5739.95s]  for the five community subs
[5741.38s -> 5745.12s]  and Sunny J for the five community subs.
[5749.65s -> 5751.09s]  Wink Dink City, that's right.
[5752.59s -> 5753.55s]  Okay, coming up next.
[5754.69s -> 5760.22s]  We have a, this is Uncut Gems.
[5760.22s -> 5762.48s]  I don't know if it's part of the trailer.
[5762.48s -> 5763.52s]  It might be part of the trailer.
[5763.52s -> 5763.84s]  I don't know.
[5763.84s -> 5765.04s]  I can't tell.
[5765.04s -> 5767.28s]  Or this could be a part of the movie.
[5767.28s -> 5769.52s]  This could be a very somewhere late game
[5770.48s -> 5771.60s]  or I don't know, mid game.
[5771.60s -> 5772.74s]  I don't know.
[5772.74s -> 5776.58s]  Or Uncut Gems.
[5776.58s -> 5780.19s]  So regardless, if you've never seen Uncut Gems
[5780.19s -> 5781.23s]  and you don't, even if you're like,
[5781.23s -> 5781.79s]  no, fuck that.
[5781.79s -> 5783.39s]  And I want to see a single thing.
[5783.39s -> 5786.42s]  I'm back in about one minute.
[5786.42s -> 5791.89s]  Okay, here we go.
[5791.89s -> 5798.18s]  It's incoming in three, two, one.
[5798.18s -> 5802.27s]  Uncut Gems spoilers.
[5802.27s -> 5803.71s]  Get married with me now.
[5803.71s -> 5804.21s]  It's okay.
[5810.11s -> 5811.71s]  Oh, this fuck you got.
[5812.75s -> 5814.03s]  Do not let him in.
[5814.03s -> 5815.15s]  Understand me?
[5815.15s -> 5816.27s]  Just ignore him.
[5816.27s -> 5817.31s]  Ignore him, Jodie.
[5817.95s -> 5822.46s]  Okay, that was not, that was like from the trailer.
[5822.46s -> 5823.42s]  Okay, whatever.
[5823.42s -> 5823.98s]  But still.
[5829.46s -> 5835.65s]  Melonhead, thanks for the five subs.
[5835.65s -> 5839.82s]  Okay, this is called I'm So Sorry.
[5839.82s -> 5843.58s]  And right off the bat, a mod, a mod in the chat.
[5844.38s -> 5848.45s]  Grump Clump just said, oh boy, this one.
[5848.45s -> 5849.09s]  Take a look at that.
[5849.09s -> 5851.33s]  One hour mustache hair.
[5851.33s -> 5851.97s]  I told you.
[5854.85s -> 5857.49s]  And eventually, this is going to keep parting
[5858.75s -> 5860.27s]  until it's complete mustache.
[5860.99s -> 5863.95s]  The definition starting to form on the, well, my left.
[5867.06s -> 5868.98s]  No, my right, your left.
[5868.98s -> 5873.74s]  On your left, my right side, you'll see.
[5873.74s -> 5877.14s]  Anyways, this one, apparently this I'm So Sorry.
[5877.14s -> 5879.38s]  And a mod said, oh no, this one.
[5879.38s -> 5880.58s]  Okay, well, that makes me scared.
[5880.58s -> 5881.14s]  Let's go.
[5881.30s -> 5883.86s]  Wait, did anybody even say that?
[5884.50s -> 5885.54s]  Did I just make that up?
[5886.18s -> 5887.54s]  Is he wearing underwear?
[5887.54s -> 5889.30s]  I think I just made that up, but yes, I am.
[5889.86s -> 5912.10s]  Wait, did anybody even say that?
[5912.10s -> 5917.57s]  You edited out my pants.
[5917.57s -> 5919.49s]  This is like a 3D model.
[5919.49s -> 5921.57s]  It's like a Sims character in the mirror.
[5921.57s -> 5926.46s]  Those aren't real feet.
[5926.46s -> 5935.79s]  How did he do it?
[5935.79s -> 5936.27s]  I don't know.
[5937.07s -> 5937.55s]  I don't know.
[5938.27s -> 5940.43s]  Did he put it in front of a green screen?
[5942.02s -> 5945.54s]  He had to have made a 3D character or model or something.
[5948.50s -> 5950.34s]  He put it in front of a green screen and then cut it.
[5950.34s -> 5951.62s]  But no, this is not me.
[5952.18s -> 5956.18s]  It's the creator.
[5956.18s -> 5957.30s]  It's the editor's legs.
[5958.98s -> 5963.06s]  So you're telling me the editor did a full frontal nude video
[5963.06s -> 5964.98s]  and then edited me on top of it?
[5969.94s -> 5971.38s]  No, that's a 3D model.
[5971.38s -> 5972.42s]  You can clearly tell.
[5972.42s -> 5973.76s]  All right, let's go.
[5975.60s -> 5980.08s]  Coming up next is spoilers for American Psycho.
[5980.08s -> 5982.08s]  This is the movie spoiler stream
[5982.08s -> 5985.78s]  where we spoil every movie that's in your Netflix backlog.
[5986.50s -> 5990.85s]  Spoilers incoming for American Psycho.
[5990.85s -> 5994.88s]  Okay.
[5994.88s -> 5998.16s]  Three, two, one, go.
[5998.16s -> 6005.01s]  Where's the audio?
[6049.49s -> 6050.13s]  Skeleton...
[6050.13s -> 6052.77s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6054.40s -> 6058.16s]  Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy for Jerma Rumble 2020.
[6070.62s -> 6073.84s]  You know what's fucking ridiculous about that picture?
[6073.84s -> 6075.68s]  Let's break this down real quick.
[6077.31s -> 6080.03s]  This was just thrown together over footage
[6080.03s -> 6082.64s]  that was taken almost 10 years ago.
[6082.64s -> 6086.38s]  The ads that you see now look like this.
[6088.27s -> 6090.43s]  This stupid fucking thing pops up
[6090.43s -> 6091.63s]  on the top of your browser,
[6091.63s -> 6092.67s]  on the right of your browser,
[6092.67s -> 6094.11s]  on the left of your browser.
[6094.11s -> 6096.91s]  We have come so far in technology.
[6096.91s -> 6099.55s]  Why haven't the ads caught up, right?
[6099.55s -> 6100.11s]  Isn't that...
[6100.11s -> 6101.31s]  I feel like that's a huge problem
[6101.31s -> 6103.31s]  why people don't want to fucking listen to a single ad.
[6103.31s -> 6105.87s]  Well, look at a single ad because they look like this.
[6106.67s -> 6111.33s]  It looked like they were made in paint in 10 seconds.
[6111.33s -> 6118.62s]  That's stupid.
[6118.62s -> 6119.10s]  You're right.
[6119.10s -> 6119.42s]  What do you mean?
[6119.42s -> 6120.06s]  Am I being...
[6120.06s -> 6121.18s]  Wait, am I being disagreed with?
[6125.14s -> 6126.90s]  Wait, am I being disagreed with?
[6128.88s -> 6130.96s]  Oh, you don't have adblock.
[6130.96s -> 6131.46s]  LOL.
[6132.00s -> 6135.57s]  Yeah, but the reason why they were...
[6135.57s -> 6137.81s]  The reason why adblock was invented in the first place
[6137.81s -> 6139.81s]  is because a banner would pop up
[6139.81s -> 6142.88s]  and it would be like somebody's dick
[6142.88s -> 6145.68s]  or it would be like some weird fucked up website
[6145.68s -> 6147.94s]  that you don't want to go to anymore.
[6147.94s -> 6148.50s]  And you'd be like...
[6149.78s -> 6151.30s]  When I say anymore, I mean like ever.
[6152.58s -> 6157.22s]  Okay, let's break that up so you don't want to...
[6157.22s -> 6159.62s]  Listen, ads were intrusive and...
[6160.98s -> 6162.26s]  I fucking can't.
[6167.38s -> 6168.82s]  Ads were intrusive.
[6168.82s -> 6171.06s]  They were annoying and they were ugly.
[6171.06s -> 6173.97s]  They were very ugly.
[6173.97s -> 6175.57s]  And now they may have even...
[6175.57s -> 6178.05s]  Some companies try to make ads look a little better
[6178.05s -> 6182.80s]  but they take up your whole screen, especially on mobile.
[6182.80s -> 6183.84s]  And you try to close the thing
[6183.84s -> 6185.36s]  and you keep scrolling it pops back up against...
[6186.08s -> 6189.04s]  No, just they've taken over the whole screen
[6189.04s -> 6192.72s]  not just annoyed some of it and put like gross weird stuff.
[6193.79s -> 6194.75s]  All right, let's go.
[6194.75s -> 6196.03s]  Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[6196.59s -> 6198.06s]  Just use adblock.
[6198.06s -> 6199.82s]  But that was why adblock was invented.
[6199.82s -> 6201.34s]  It was because ads sucked in the first place.
[6201.34s -> 6202.38s]  What if ads didn't suck?
[6203.82s -> 6205.66s]  Why do you think I don't run ads on this channel?
[6205.66s -> 6208.64s]  Because they're fucking annoying.
[6208.64s -> 6210.56s]  And I don't want to have you guys suffer
[6210.56s -> 6214.83s]  through the same like three ads 200 times.
[6214.83s -> 6219.44s]  How many times do you guys want to watch the new
[6219.44s -> 6220.72s]  like Call of Duty trailer?
[6222.80s -> 6224.88s]  40 to 50 times?
[6224.88s -> 6229.57s]  I don't...
[6229.57s -> 6230.37s]  I wouldn't want to do that.
[6232.27s -> 6233.71s]  Living above a spee nest.
[6233.71s -> 6234.19s]  Okay, let's go.
[6235.07s -> 6236.54s]  Let's go.
[6236.54s -> 6237.04s]  Oh no.
[6241.22s -> 6241.94s]  Hi, hello.
[6241.94s -> 6242.82s]  Yes, how are you?
[6243.78s -> 6244.28s]  Shut up.
[6245.66s -> 6246.46s]  Shut up.
[6246.46s -> 6246.86s]  All of you.
[6246.86s -> 6247.26s]  Let's go.
[6247.90s -> 6249.28s]  It's ridiculous.
[6250.30s -> 6252.38s]  It's like this every single day.
[6252.94s -> 6254.54s]  And I'm sick and tired of hearing it.
[6254.54s -> 6259.26s]  I can hear you all the way up here.
[6259.26s -> 6260.30s]  And I pay rent too.
[6263.74s -> 6264.54s]  Unbelievable.
[6272.58s -> 6274.82s]  Yes, my more slick hair.
[6274.82s -> 6276.98s]  Here comes another Star Wars clip.
[6277.06s -> 6280.30s]  This is chat during green screen streams.
[6280.30s -> 6281.82s]  If you've never seen any of the Star Wars...
[6281.82s -> 6282.30s]  Who cares?
[6282.86s -> 6284.38s]  I'll be honest.
[6286.77s -> 6287.49s]  It's not...
[6287.49s -> 6288.53s]  Don't worry, but it's all right.
[6289.09s -> 6291.33s]  All right, here we go.
[6291.33s -> 6292.53s]  Chat during a green screen stream.
[6292.53s -> 6293.81s]  This is going to be from either the...
[6293.81s -> 6294.53s]  One of the...
[6294.53s -> 6296.85s]  The sequel series of Star Wars.
[6296.85s -> 6297.89s]  Be careful if you haven't seen it.
[6297.89s -> 6298.93s]  All of you have.
[6298.93s -> 6301.71s]  Three, two...
[6306.50s -> 6322.50s]  Wait, what was that?
[6323.06s -> 6326.74s]  What was that?
[6329.34s -> 6337.47s]  Dead.
[6337.47s -> 6338.91s]  Oh, I see.
[6338.91s -> 6339.71s]  The bar was in the way.
[6342.64s -> 6344.77s]  Okay, wow.
[6344.77s -> 6345.98s]  Dermacraft gets a taunt kill.
[6348.10s -> 6348.42s]  Nice.
[6349.06s -> 6351.31s]  That's short and sweet.
[6353.22s -> 6356.42s]  Dermacraft gets interrupted by the Iron Giant.
[6357.06s -> 6358.50s]  Is this the Iron Giant?
[6363.17s -> 6363.49s]  Okay.
[6366.51s -> 6368.75s]  A lot of you after these streams are gonna...
[6368.75s -> 6370.11s]  You're gonna go to your Netflix
[6370.11s -> 6371.47s]  and you're just gonna start
[6371.47s -> 6373.55s]  getting stuff off of your watch list
[6373.55s -> 6375.73s]  and your wish list and stuff.
[6375.73s -> 6378.21s]  You probably have like 10 to 15 shows and movies.
[6378.21s -> 6380.29s]  You're gonna go remove like four or five of them.
[6380.29s -> 6386.03s]  This is huge spoilers for the Iron Giant.
[6386.03s -> 6387.71s]  Huge spoilers for the Iron Giant.
[6393.28s -> 6394.00s]  All right, we're...
[6398.24s -> 6413.92s]  We're second at the...
[6413.92s -> 6414.80s]  That was supposed to be me.
[6427.63s -> 6431.28s]  What is even going on?
[6441.22s -> 6441.94s]  I saw the...
[6441.94s -> 6442.10s]  I...
[6445.82s -> 6450.30s]  This is a great movie.
[6450.30s -> 6462.94s]  That was huge, Rula, by the way.
[6462.94s -> 6463.50s]  That was enormous.
[6463.50s -> 6464.54s]  It was as big as the Iron Giant.
[6493.39s -> 6500.32s]  This made me love the Iron Giant character so much.
[6502.08s -> 6502.48s]  All right.
[6503.97s -> 6504.37s]  Good.
[6504.37s -> 6506.58s]  Because this is what happened
[6506.58s -> 6508.42s]  when Chuck E. Cheese was on the stream.
[6508.42s -> 6518.61s]  Thermo Jeopardy!
[6520.02s -> 6522.98s]  This is Jeopardy!
[6522.98s -> 6534.83s]  It's gonna all be...
[6534.83s -> 6535.95s]  Oh, Earl Bump is here.
[6535.95s -> 6536.99s]  Finally got Earl Bump.
[6537.79s -> 6548.34s]  Reuben Guy.
[6563.07s -> 6563.55s]  Come on.
[6564.45s -> 6565.01s]  Come on.
[6572.29s -> 6573.17s]  Celebration.
[6573.17s -> 6573.57s]  Thank you.
[6574.77s -> 6575.73s]  Wow, you won.
[6575.73s -> 6576.29s]  You did it.
[6576.29s -> 6577.17s]  You get to go up there.
[6581.70s -> 6582.66s]  God, that looks like fun.
[6583.46s -> 6584.66s]  That looks like a lot of fun.
[6584.66s -> 6585.78s]  I wish I could get up there.
[6591.44s -> 6592.08s]  Son of a bitch.
[6592.64s -> 6596.74s]  After a while, Jeremy and Earl made it to the final Jeopardy.
[6598.56s -> 6600.64s]  It cost us this much money to hire Louis Anderson.
[6601.68s -> 6604.48s]  Bob, what is $3,200?
[6605.28s -> 6606.24s]  Probably more than that.
[6615.15s -> 6615.79s]  Wait, me?
[6616.51s -> 6617.07s]  Wait, me?
[6618.03s -> 6618.99s]  I get it?
[6618.99s -> 6620.59s]  I get to go up there.
[6620.59s -> 6621.71s]  No way.
[6621.71s -> 6622.59s]  No way.
[6622.59s -> 6623.23s]  Right here, man.
[6624.03s -> 6624.59s]  Fuck you.
[6624.59s -> 6626.11s]  You gotta get a high five from me.
[6626.11s -> 6627.23s]  Maybe I need one of these, though.
[6629.17s -> 6631.31s]  What is one of these?
[6631.31s -> 6631.87s]  No way.
[6632.83s -> 6635.31s]  Oh, yes.
[6635.31s -> 6642.02s]  What's in the mystery box?
[6642.74s -> 6661.44s]  Hey, do you guys want to know something funny?
[6662.00s -> 6669.87s]  Your cube video got claimed because of, I believe, that song or that clip that I fucking had to buy.
[6674.29s -> 6677.68s]  Like, I bought this.
[6677.68s -> 6679.26s]  Like, I purchased this thing.
[6679.82s -> 6683.68s]  I think they claimed the song.
[6684.40s -> 6687.41s]  No, this is not Dr. Phil.
[6688.53s -> 6692.34s]  Is that Dr. Phil?
[6697.74s -> 6698.38s]  No, it's not.
[6698.94s -> 6700.98s]  Is this a repeat thing?
[6700.98s -> 6702.10s]  Did we talk about this already?
[6702.90s -> 6708.34s]  Yes, we did.
[6708.74s -> 6710.10s]  Yeah, I was playing visitor cleanup.
[6710.10s -> 6710.50s]  Yeah, you're right.
[6710.50s -> 6710.98s]  You're right.
[6710.98s -> 6711.22s]  Yeah.
[6711.86s -> 6721.68s]  Guys, remember, I've spoken out loud for like 20 years straight.
[6721.68s -> 6725.12s]  Sometimes it's hard to remember.
[6725.12s -> 6726.94s]  All right, this is Beach Vlog.
[6727.50s -> 6731.62s]  There we go.
[6731.62s -> 6732.26s]  Beach Vlog.
[6735.70s -> 6754.18s]  Perfect YouTube intro.
[6754.18s -> 6754.68s]  Hey.
[6756.88s -> 6757.38s]  Fuck.
[6759.57s -> 6760.29s]  Fuck.
[6760.29s -> 6771.41s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[6771.41s -> 6779.60s]  I am here on vacation.
[6779.60s -> 6780.40s]  Oh, no.
[6780.40s -> 6783.52s]  You didn't have the video outside the plane window.
[6784.64s -> 6805.62s]  And it got me through many waves.
[6805.62s -> 6817.44s]  Nobody used this for what I wanted either.
[6818.24s -> 6820.03s]  Nobody put me on a slide.
[6835.39s -> 6837.07s]  What the fuck is going on?
[6837.07s -> 6837.71s]  I'm going to sneeze.
[6838.27s -> 6840.67s]  I just want you to understand I'm going to sneeze.
[6840.67s -> 6841.71s]  No, I don't want you to be near me.
[6844.21s -> 6847.23s]  I held it in.
[6847.79s -> 6850.86s]  No, don't sneeze.
[6850.86s -> 6851.34s]  Don't sneeze.
[6851.34s -> 6851.90s]  Don't sneeze.
[6853.26s -> 6856.05s]  Sorry for making this mess of a video.
[6856.05s -> 6856.69s]  It's 3 a.m.
[6856.69s -> 6857.25s]  I'm so bored.
[6857.25s -> 6858.05s]  Thanks for watching, though.
[6858.05s -> 6859.89s]  I'll be surprised that this even makes it in.
[6869.84s -> 6870.56s]  Well, it did.
[6871.52s -> 6872.77s]  I liked it.
[6872.77s -> 6873.41s]  What's wrong with it?
[6873.97s -> 6877.97s]  This stylish desktop computer comes with a Pentium 4 processor, DVD,
[6877.97s -> 6881.81s]  ROM, 60 gigabyte hard drive, and a printer, a perfect addition to your home.
[6881.81s -> 6886.29s]  Every American I was told had that computer 15 years ago.
[6887.33s -> 6893.86s]  $150, Tracy.
[6893.86s -> 6894.82s]  $900.
[6894.82s -> 6896.26s]  $900, Craig.
[6897.92s -> 6898.72s]  $1,700.
[6898.72s -> 6899.44s]  $700.
[6902.54s -> 6903.04s]  Bruh.
[6904.31s -> 6904.81s]  Yes.
[6906.55s -> 6908.55s]  What is $12?
[6924.39s -> 6925.43s]  What the fuck happened?
[6926.23s -> 6928.37s]  You're going to play the piano.
[6936.32s -> 6937.20s]  Do you eat ass?
[6940.64s -> 6943.36s]  I think I should be the first person to say yes.
[6944.16s -> 6946.16s]  Oh, all right.
[6946.16s -> 6947.04s]  This is like you made it.
[6947.04s -> 6948.48s]  Well, look, this is your moment.
[6948.48s -> 6949.12s]  And good luck.
[6950.32s -> 6952.32s]  You made like a this is a Simon.
[6979.75s -> 6982.02s]  I've heard enough.
[6982.02s -> 6982.52s]  Come on.
[6983.46s -> 6984.46s]  Come on.
[6985.10s -> 7002.79s]  This isn't working for me.
[7002.79s -> 7007.03s]  I'm just looking and seeing some of the others where I'm seeing originality.
[7007.03s -> 7008.79s]  This, to me, is too generic.
[7009.35s -> 7010.79s]  Not enough personality.
[7012.47s -> 7013.47s]  Huh?
[7015.78s -> 7016.28s]  Okay.
[7017.30s -> 7018.42s]  We have a guy back here.
[7019.06s -> 7019.86s]  What's that, sir?
[7020.90s -> 7022.74s]  I'm kind of in the middle of doing something here.
[7023.38s -> 7025.88s]  Can we get security to take care of this guy?
[7030.73s -> 7032.65s]  You could be funnier than I am.
[7032.65s -> 7033.85s]  I highly doubt that, though.
[7077.02s -> 7077.98s]  It's crazy, people.
[7084.86s -> 7085.50s]  That was great.
[7087.40s -> 7088.44s]  To be continued.
[7092.33s -> 7094.09s]  The Kylo German drive-through.
[7096.07s -> 7097.19s]  My fucking eyes hurt.
[7099.22s -> 7102.18s]  My eyes hurt from just like laughing at this shit.
[7102.18s -> 7102.74s]  Okay, here we go.
[7102.74s -> 7138.10s]  Can I get a you guys you can still have coffee.
[7138.10s -> 7139.14s]  And you guys have coffee.
[7139.14s -> 7141.46s]  It says you serve breakfast all day.
[7141.46s -> 7145.69s]  I'm one of those fucking weirdos that comes at like 7 30 looking for all the breakfast items.
[7149.05s -> 7149.55s]  Okay.
[7151.69s -> 7162.78s]  Wow, this place is sick.
[7172.31s -> 7173.35s]  Can you put the ice in it?
[7173.35s -> 7176.31s]  Can you put some ice in the coffee, please?
[7191.16s -> 7203.51s]  Oh, really good use of the bugleberry cameo.
[7211.58s -> 7212.38s]  He loves it.
[7212.38s -> 7213.58s]  Can you put the ice in it?
[7213.58s -> 7214.78s]  He loves McDonald's.
[7218.10s -> 7219.54s]  Okay, there's German in a bottle of water.
[7220.10s -> 7250.01s]  Who will breathe?
[7255.37s -> 7255.87s]  Idiots.
[7260.52s -> 7261.02s]  Yeah.
[7266.82s -> 7268.50s]  This is the thing I'm talking about right here.
[7269.14s -> 7270.34s]  I told you guys this before.
[7272.10s -> 7273.30s]  Absolute perfection.
[7274.68s -> 7275.80s]  No ifs, ands, or buts.
[7276.84s -> 7280.76s]  This right here is absolute perfection.
[7284.66s -> 7296.84s]  This is it right here.
[7296.84s -> 7298.12s]  No, it's not purple alien.
[7298.12s -> 7299.16s]  Don't get your hopes up.
[7304.71s -> 7307.86s]  Hey, are you in charge of this?
[7307.86s -> 7311.43s]  Here's what I have to say about this.
[7312.87s -> 7313.75s]  See this bullshit.

[7341.93s -> 7346.12s]  Yes, it's a fictional drink in the valve universe.
[7346.12s -> 7348.95s]  Oh, here we go.
[7348.95s -> 7351.05s]  Jerma hits a home run.
[7352.60s -> 7370.02s]  This pixelation is so ridiculous.

[7385.48s -> 7389.40s]  I'm going to play Team Fortress 2 as the pyromaniac.
[7389.40s -> 7391.64s]  I'm going to be playing Team Fortress 2 as?
[7392.28s -> 7392.92s]  Mario.
[7401.94s -> 7402.90s]  Woo hoo hoo.

[7426.76s -> 7427.80s]  Pizza music.

[7443.18s -> 7443.82s]  Coffee Cheetos.
[7443.82s -> 7444.62s]  Coffee Cheetos.
[7444.62s -> 7445.34s]  Chicken.
[7445.34s -> 7446.14s]  Coffee Cheetos.
[7446.14s -> 7447.02s]  Coffee Cheetos.
[7447.02s -> 7447.66s]  Chicken.
[7447.66s -> 7447.98s]  Chicken.
[7447.98s -> 7448.46s]  Chicken.

[7498.04s -> 7508.04s]  here giant enemy Kirby the giant enemy have we seen this one before
[7508.04s -> 7609.62s]  yeah sneaking around two-fourth same same turkey arms
[7609.62s -> 7619.23s]  Jerma's bunt of 46 veteran player Jeremy Albertson had joined the Boston Red Sox
[7619.27s -> 7623.01s]  Jeremy had found himself playing with some of the greatest ever put on the
[7623.01s -> 7628.61s]  Red Sox uniform like Bobby Doerr Johnny Pesky and Teddy Ballgame himself Ted
[7628.61s -> 7633.87s]  Williams Jeremy was a strong player being a consistently good hitter
[7633.87s -> 7637.75s]  throughout his entire career however Jeremy was quite mediocre when it came
[7637.75s -> 7641.99s]  to his defense his short stature meant that some balls would go right past him
[7641.99s -> 7648.38s]  when the ball gets past Albertson he can't reach it now one more score and when
[7648.38s -> 7662.35s]  Jeremy was moved to the outfield things didn't get any better but on one fateful
[7662.35s -> 7667.28s]  day during one fateful game Jeremy would write himself into their history books
[7667.28s -> 7676.38s]  forever with one visit to the batter's box somebody did it so it is the bunt
[7676.38s -> 7697.18s]  home run and sure enough the home run became history
[7697.18s -> 7701.00s]  Jeremy remains as the only player to have bunted a ball for an out-of-the-park
[7701.16s -> 7706.18s]  home run many have tried but Albertson's home run stands alone to this day
[7706.18s -> 7717.19s]  excellent excellent excellent excellent all right coming up next

[7811.33s -> 7820.88s]  doing now Jeremy at the plate he's that thread he wants to be up in those big

[7861.59s -> 7869.94s]  back-to-back baseball themed ones down the rat hole we go oh shit someone's
[7869.94s -> 7884.73s]  like coming in oh fuck dude oh he's got he's got a knife this is Jeremy I once
[7884.73s -> 7889.21s]  started in 34 year old with a loving following a gamer girlfriend and a
[7889.21s -> 7894.89s]  stable job he was on top of the mountain of success his life seemed to
[7894.89s -> 7900.65s]  be perfect then what went wrong from primetime streamer down to a hole of
[7900.65s -> 7911.38s]  addiction and fights we go down the rat hole of German I net five I dead in this
[7911.38s -> 7917.77s]  video it all began with his notorious dreams of various games which amazed
[7917.77s -> 7922.25s]  millions of views and thousands of followers thanks to his charming
[7922.25s -> 7929.46s]  personality and humor this quickly skyrocketed Jeremy into success at first
[7929.46s -> 7933.82s]  he was easy going with his newfound fundings spending his newfound money on
[7933.82s -> 7937.90s]  better quality for his streams and better games to entertain his fan base
[7937.90s -> 7945.19s]  but this power quickly began to take a toll on his populating quickly made him
[7945.19s -> 7950.35s]  develop on it for more power as you can sometimes see his streams the rage he
[7950.35s -> 7954.67s]  had boiling inside of him streams quickly dropped in quality as he became
[7954.67s -> 7959.11s]  more desperate for probability eventually this will lead to a gambling
[7959.11s -> 7965.03s]  addiction as to find any way of feeling strong once more but it will prove to
[7965.03s -> 7972.28s]  become a failed attempt I don't even care if I win this is the rush of the colors
[7972.28s -> 7978.91s]  now with no money and no fame he resorted to giving morale speeches in the
[7978.91s -> 7985.64s]  high school dance nervous for all of us so on this particular day that's so
[7985.64s -> 7997.56s]  stupid that's dumb we talked about that's fucking stupid yeah look I'm
[7997.56s -> 8007.00s]  holding up yeah look I'm holding up buddy yeah no finger no finger no we

[8019.28s -> 8023.50s]  what the fuck what the fuck's wrong with you
[8023.50s -> 8029.06s]  as we try to capture footage he recognized us and became hostile very quickly
[8029.06s -> 8032.26s]  why do I have to hurt and kill so many of you guys
[8032.26s -> 8034.26s]  you're the one I'm gonna get
[8034.26s -> 8037.33s]  die you motherfucker
[8037.53s -> 8062.89s]  police were called but in his rageful state of mind he resisted arrest and
[8062.89s -> 8067.19s]  that's the end of Jeremy's story from what it seemed to be the peak of success
[8067.19s -> 8091.10s]  it all came crumbling down the rat hole thank you very much yes that was nuts
[8091.10s -> 8096.40s]  was walking like so you guys okay you guys don't hear because I have like a
[8096.40s -> 8099.96s]  noise gate on and like I lean back when I watch and sometimes I mute if I get a

[8143.87s -> 8147.79s]  how he makes me laugh and then I appreciate him I could see in his eyes
[8147.79s -> 8154.48s]  were dollar signs ask me so large was the last donation you made explain that

[8735.21s -> 8737.39s]  What this is
[8737.39s -> 8739.39s]  This is a videos that
[8739.39s -> 8741.39s]  resurfaced
[8741.39s -> 8743.39s]  10 years later that I should be embarrassed of now
[8743.39s -> 8750.41s]  Today
[8750.41s -> 8752.41s]  Oh hey look at this clip of you dude
[8752.41s -> 8754.41s]  Remember back when you did this shit
[8756.41s -> 8758.41s]  That was like 2 months ago
[8758.41s -> 8764.73s]  It's like oh remember back in 2011
[8764.73s -> 8766.73s]  when you made the
[8766.73s -> 8768.73s]  Minecraft series, JermaCraft
[8768.73s -> 8771.48s]  That's the kind of reaction I should be having to these
[8771.48s -> 8773.48s]  But I did them like
[8773.48s -> 8780.59s]  Not even a year ago
[8780.59s -> 8785.00s]  Alright
[8785.00s -> 8787.00s]  I'm going to take
[8787.00s -> 8789.00s]  Next like 2 or 3 weeks
[8789.00s -> 8791.00s]  And 100 days
[8791.00s -> 8793.00s]  Only focus on
[8793.00s -> 8795.00s]  This game my dog
[8795.00s -> 8797.24s]  Say goodbye to your seed might want to do
[8797.24s -> 8799.24s]  That seed might want to do
[8799.24s -> 8801.24s]  And get actually definitively
[8801.24s -> 8803.24s]  Truly diagnosed
[8803.24s -> 8805.24s]  For whatever the fuck is
[8805.24s -> 8809.60s]  Going on
[8809.60s -> 8811.60s]  What is this
[8811.60s -> 8818.32s]  Oh alright
[8818.32s -> 8822.09s]  Alright
[8822.09s -> 8824.09s]  Goodbye
[8824.09s -> 8826.33s]  Also
[8826.33s -> 8828.33s]  I wouldn't here
[8828.33s -> 8830.33s]  I got to talk about this
[8830.33s -> 8832.33s]  So this kind of bleeds into a conversation we can have about
[8832.33s -> 8834.33s]  Future videos
[8834.33s -> 8837.66s]  If we could stay away from
[8837.66s -> 8840.16s]  Like real
[8840.16s -> 8843.23s]  Tragedy
[8843.23s -> 8846.88s]  That would be a very good thing
[8846.88s -> 8848.88s]  There's been a couple of videos that have come through that are like
[8848.88s -> 8850.88s]  Oh hey we've got like
[8850.88s -> 8853.18s]  Oh there's like a house
[8853.18s -> 8855.18s]  That burnt down and stuff you know what I mean
[8855.18s -> 8861.07s]  Like oh no but this is
[8861.07s -> 8863.07s]  This is the Paul Walker clip right
[8863.07s -> 8872.41s]  Cause don't they do like a thing
[8872.41s -> 8878.88s]  It's the movie no I know it's the movie
[8878.88s -> 8881.69s]  But what I'm saying is like
[8881.69s -> 8883.69s]  This is from Fast and Furious yeah
[8883.69s -> 8894.56s]  That is dumb
[8894.56s -> 8896.56s]  What I'm talking about is Paul Walker died
[8896.56s -> 8898.92s]  Kind of right before this right
[8898.92s -> 8902.32s]  And although this is like
[8902.32s -> 8904.32s]  A goodbye to Paul Walker
[8904.32s -> 8908.80s]  Right it's I mean putting me
[8908.80s -> 8912.32s]  Here I don't know
[8912.32s -> 8914.32s]  Like it's sort of like
[8914.32s -> 8918.60s]  Yeah you're right I'm just
[8918.60s -> 8921.04s]  Trying to come off as I'm trying not to be
[8921.04s -> 8923.04s]  I don't want these to be like disrespectful we'll put it that way
[8923.04s -> 8925.98s]  And as however I can
[8925.98s -> 8929.12s]  Say that I'm gonna say that okay
[8929.12s -> 8936.22s]  Am I overthinking it maybe
[8936.22s -> 8938.22s]  A little bit but I still I don't I know that like
[8938.22s -> 8940.22s]  Some some stuff can come
[8940.22s -> 8942.72s]  Across as like
[8942.72s -> 8944.72s]  Disrespectful and I don't want that to happen
[8944.72s -> 8953.92s]  But let's go
[8953.92s -> 8955.92s]  I used to say I lived my life a quarter mile
[8955.92s -> 8959.56s]  At a time and I think that's why
[8959.56s -> 8962.38s]  We were broke
[8962.38s -> 8964.38s]  It's his channel well
[8964.38s -> 8966.38s]  Look there's been a lot of videos that have come through
[8966.38s -> 8972.46s]  And we try to like
[8972.46s -> 8974.46s]  Put them in a good enough order
[8974.46s -> 8976.46s]  And we try to take weed out
[8976.46s -> 8978.76s]  There'll be like 500 videos
[8978.76s -> 8984.20s]  So my channel my rules
[8984.20s -> 8987.34s]  There's also on that list we gotta talk about
[8987.34s -> 8989.34s]  Like the copyright stuff we gotta be careful there too
[8989.34s -> 8991.71s]  That's another thing we have to
[8991.71s -> 8993.71s]  We'll talk about this at the end
[8993.71s -> 9013.72s]  It's my channel
[9013.72s -> 9015.72s]  It's not it's not your channel
[9015.72s -> 9018.41s]  It's my channel
[9018.41s -> 9024.04s]  He's above the law
[9024.04s -> 9031.72s]  The dead angle doesn't date it
[9031.72s -> 9033.72s]  Gets caught low again
[9033.72s -> 9035.72s]  Has to burst immediately
[9035.72s -> 9040.84s]  Low meter
[9040.84s -> 9043.21s]  Oh my god
[9043.21s -> 9045.21s]  So smart he couldn't burst
[9045.21s -> 9047.21s]  Because of the super
[9047.21s -> 9049.21s]  But Woshiga thinks it's over
[9049.21s -> 9052.16s]  What the fuck
[9052.16s -> 9054.16s]  What the fuck
[9054.16s -> 9064.83s]  Woshiga thought it was over
[9064.83s -> 9066.83s]  Woshiga thought it was over
[9066.83s -> 9068.83s]  And stood up and Ogawa gave him
[9068.83s -> 9070.83s]  No remorse
[9070.83s -> 9072.83s]  Exactly what happens
[9072.83s -> 9074.83s]  Oh my god
[9076.83s -> 9079.52s]  I don't even know what that is
[9079.52s -> 9081.52s]  I don't even know what that is
[9081.52s -> 9083.52s]  I just experienced all of it
[9083.52s -> 9087.29s]  I experienced that entire tournament
[9087.29s -> 9099.52s]  You did though
[9099.52s -> 9112.25s]  German 985 show
[9112.25s -> 9116.54s]  Oh this looks like shit
[9116.54s -> 9118.54s]  Itchy and scratchy
[9118.54s -> 9120.54s]  Our favorite show
[9120.54s -> 9122.54s]  Nothing about this is good
[9122.54s -> 9124.54s]  I'm gonna dab you in the fucking head
[9124.54s -> 9128.43s]  Let me tell you something
[9128.43s -> 9130.43s]  If you can do not do it diplomically
[9130.43s -> 9132.43s]  Then you shouldn't be doing it at all
[9132.43s -> 9134.92s]  Now I'm really bored
[9134.92s -> 9136.92s]  I know
[9143.07s -> 9145.95s]  Ladies and gentlemen welcome to episode one
[9145.95s -> 9147.95s]  Of the show

[9156.19s -> 9158.19s]  Is ready to begin
[9158.19s -> 9160.68s]  It's gonna be very very interesting
[9160.68s -> 9162.68s]  And you're gonna say the magic words with me
[9162.68s -> 9164.68s]  Anytime we do a trick
[9164.68s -> 9166.68s]  You gotta say the magic word
[9166.68s -> 9168.68s]  The magic word is presto
[9168.68s -> 9170.99s]  Majesto
[9170.99s -> 9172.99s]  So on the count of three I want everyone to say
[9172.99s -> 9174.99s]  Presto majesto
[9174.99s -> 9176.99s]  One, two, three
[9176.99s -> 9178.99s]  Presto
[9178.99s -> 9180.99s]  Majesto
[9180.99s -> 9185.40s]  Deliver this
[9185.40s -> 9187.40s]  Ladies and gentlemen

[9671.10s -> 9673.10s]  No, no, if something, there's music behind it
[9673.10s -> 9679.95s]  With me dancing in front of it, it's not Jojo
[9679.95s -> 9681.95s]  This is Jerma caught on camera, should we do a piss break?
[9681.95s -> 9684.89s]  Anybody got a piss?

[10211.12s -> 10213.12s]  A little bit out of gas at this point
[10213.12s -> 10215.42s]  Ok
[10215.42s -> 10217.42s]  Jerma gets booed off the stage
[10217.42s -> 10230.20s]  Shit
[10230.20s -> 10232.20s]  This road sucks
[10232.20s -> 10235.28s]  Such a bad road
[10235.28s -> 10238.91s]  Seat covers
[10238.91s -> 10240.91s]  Go out and look
[10240.91s -> 10243.28s]  What's with the seat covers
[10243.28s -> 10248.72s]  There's a tree, two trees

[10294.59s -> 10296.59s]  Absolutely terrible
[10296.59s -> 10298.59s]  Jesus
[10301.08s -> 10310.81s]  What is this
[10310.81s -> 10315.55s]  I wanna

[10326.08s -> 10328.08s]  We got him
[10328.08s -> 10330.08s]  Wait, hold on
[10330.08s -> 10332.08s]  He actually hits that guy
[10332.08s -> 10337.37s]  Life is pain
[10337.37s -> 10339.37s]  I hate
[10339.37s -> 10343.34s]  What's it called
[10343.34s -> 10346.09s]  A TV show
[10346.09s -> 10348.78s]  Called El Chavo
[10348.78s -> 10355.31s]  It's called Jerma's Brush with Cigarettes
[10355.31s -> 10357.61s]  Real tragedy
[10357.61s -> 10359.85s]  I don't know
[10361.85s -> 10365.88s]  Hey
[10365.88s -> 10367.88s]  Get his plate
[10370.57s -> 10373.95s]  That's pretty good
[10373.95s -> 10375.95s]  That's pretty good
[10375.95s -> 10377.95s]  He's probably going 200
[10377.95s -> 10380.96s]  Bounds per hour
[10380.96s -> 10382.96s]  I didn't even see him
[10382.96s -> 10384.96s]  Turn it up
[10384.96s -> 10387.26s]  Turn it up
[10387.26s -> 10392.57s]  I saved the world
[10392.57s -> 10394.57s]  I just saved the world
[10394.57s -> 10401.87s]  No earth exploding
[10401.87s -> 10422.03s]  This is rescue Jerma
[10440.03s -> 10442.03s]  Michael
[10448.03s -> 10458.51s]  Look at him
[10458.51s -> 10465.68s]  Is that his
[10465.68s -> 10467.98s]  That's my thumb
[10467.98s -> 10470.16s]  Right, okay
[10470.16s -> 10473.68s]  Jerma becomes
[10473.68s -> 10477.77s]  Larry Potter
[10477.77s -> 10480.78s]  I get super excited
[10480.78s -> 10482.78s]  Uncensored version of the one
[10482.78s -> 10485.85s]  Wait, is that the one with the
[10485.85s -> 10488.22s]  Sensor bar over my fake bottom half
[10488.22s -> 10492.44s]  I'm not clicking on that
[10492.44s -> 10503.50s]  Alright, here we go
[10503.50s -> 10505.50s]  When I call your name
[10505.50s -> 10507.50s]  You will come forth
[10507.50s -> 10509.50s]  I shall place the sorting hat
[10509.50s -> 10511.50s]  On your head
[10511.50s -> 10513.50s]  And you will be sorted into your houses
[10513.50s -> 10515.50s]  Is it my turn
[10515.50s -> 10517.50s]  Oh, great sorting hat
[10517.50s -> 10519.68s]  I know exactly what I'm
[10519.68s -> 10521.85s]  Going to get
[10521.85s -> 10524.67s]  I'm a Slytherin
[10524.67s -> 10529.21s]  Right then
[10529.21s -> 10531.45s]  I'm a Slytherin
[10531.45s -> 10533.95s]  No
[10533.95s -> 10539.00s]  Stop laughing
[10539.00s -> 10541.63s]  This hat for me immediately
[10541.63s -> 10544.64s]  Torturing
[10544.64s -> 10546.64s]  Murdering people, murdering them
[10546.64s -> 10548.64s]  Slytherin
[10548.64s -> 10551.52s]  See, I told you
[10551.52s -> 10555.48s]  You're evil too, right
[10555.48s -> 10557.48s]  We're probably going to be really good friends
[10557.48s -> 10561.32s]  I'll probably die in the third movie
[10561.32s -> 10563.32s]  Three movies later, uh oh
[10563.32s -> 10568.19s]  Now hand me the prophecy
[10568.19s -> 10572.67s]  Death eaters
[10572.67s -> 10574.67s]  Expelliars
[10574.67s -> 10577.36s]  Hahahaha

[10610.30s -> 10627.00s]  Seven and a half minutes
[10627.00s -> 10635.84s]  I'm just checking to see how
[10635.84s -> 10637.84s]  Just watch it
[10637.84s -> 10639.84s]  If I get the feeling that I'm going to get arrested
[10639.84s -> 10641.84s]  I'm going to skip it, okay
[10641.84s -> 10664.91s]  Oh
[10672.38s -> 10674.38s]  Both sides
[10674.38s -> 10695.55s]  I gotta skip it
[10695.55s -> 10697.55s]  I gotta skip it, I gotta skip it, I gotta skip it
[10697.55s -> 10699.72s]  I'm going to get arrested, I gotta skip it
[10699.72s -> 10702.09s]  I can't fuck around with that mouse
[10702.09s -> 10704.46s]  That mouse will fucking eat me alive
[10704.46s -> 10711.69s]  He'll eat me whole, I will get swallowed whole from the mouse
[10711.69s -> 10714.83s]  Alright, this is a Vod
[10714.83s -> 10728.40s]  Destroyer horse
[10728.40s -> 10730.40s]  Why did I just read that out
[10730.40s -> 10741.53s]  Loud, oh

[10764.54s -> 10769.79s]  No, okay, hold on
[10769.79s -> 10772.35s]  I can't
[10772.35s -> 10777.66s]  It's deepfaked

[10797.26s -> 10799.26s]  Well this is a deepfake
[10799.26s -> 10801.26s]  I don't have this hair
[10827.32s -> 10830.59s]  What the hell
[10830.59s -> 10832.59s]  Prove that you don't have this hair right now
[10838.86s -> 10840.86s]  That guy was brain screened, I thought that was me in a costume
[10840.86s -> 10842.86s]  I thought that was me in a fucking costume
[10868.65s -> 10881.26s]  For you
[10881.26s -> 10883.26s]  You're the one I'm going to get
[10889.26s -> 10891.26s]  I'm kicking ass right now
[10897.26s -> 10899.26s]  It's just a deepfake
[10899.26s -> 10901.26s]  It's just a deepfake
[10901.26s -> 10903.26s]  The Vod is going to get crucified
[10903.26s -> 10905.26s]  The Vod is going to get thrown into a dumpster
[10916.32s -> 10918.62s]  Not only is the Vod going to get crucified
[10918.62s -> 10920.62s]  I'm going to be fucking killed
[10920.62s -> 10931.82s]  Playlist will be available
[10931.82s -> 10934.96s]  Somebody said I don't care, continue
[10934.96s -> 10937.52s]  What if I just disappear tomorrow
[10937.52s -> 10942.25s]  What if I just don't

[15761.14s -> 15762.34s]  Okay, bye
[15762.34s -> 15764.34s]  And now back to george lopez

[15768.68s -> 15781.16s]  Wait, did I change sides that I was driving on?
[15782.90s -> 15786.50s]  Yes. Oh, I had a long day at work. Let's go

[15899.96s -> 15903.86s]  Okay, this is the final video
[15909.09s -> 15911.09s]  Real tragedy. All right
[15911.57s -> 15913.57s]  I hope you guys know what i'm talking about though
[15913.89s -> 15918.77s]  Look and in my like cbd brain did did I come to do did I could you understand what i'm saying?
[15919.25s -> 15923.57s]  You do right? Okay
[15923.57s -> 15931.25s]  Here's the final video
[15931.25s -> 15934.90s]  The germa bowl before we watch the final video. I want to say
[15936.18s -> 15937.64s]  once again
[15937.64s -> 15938.60s]  that
[15938.60s -> 15943.96s]  I am blown the fuck away by the insane amount of editing talent that a ton of you guys have
[15945.99s -> 15947.99s]  If you would have set up like a green screen thing
[15948.31s -> 15952.47s]  In a lot of places on the internet the amount of quality submissions
[15955.01s -> 15957.01s]  I mean look at me, right? Look at you
[15958.74s -> 15967.65s]  I think I think this is top-notch shit right here. So seriously, thank you for all your submissions
[15967.65s -> 15969.89s]  There were hundreds and fucking hundreds and hundreds of them
[15970.95s -> 15973.78s]  And I it's hard to cut stuff
[15974.34s -> 15977.92s]  If your video was not seen that doesn't mean that the video sucked
[15978.32s -> 15981.60s]  We just tried to remove some things and shrink it down and condense it
[15981.60s -> 15986.15s]  So it could be done over a couple of streams. This playlist is going to be available
[15988.00s -> 15990.21s]  I will give it to you
[15990.21s -> 15991.17s]  and then
[15991.17s -> 15994.85s]  Also, maybe at some point in the next week or so we might do like an extended one
[15995.51s -> 16000.90s]  Just adding some of the other submissions that were there and then you can watch
[16001.46s -> 16012.12s]  And then you can get arrested by disney on your own so part three. No, not part three
[16013.84s -> 16018.40s]  I think from this point forward we're going to take any of the new stuff that comes in and do community content stuff
[16020.39s -> 16023.35s]  And community content night is going to be a lot different
[16025.30s -> 16028.66s]  a lot of the artwork is going to be put into brb screens and
[16029.22s -> 16032.53s]  at the end of the streams
[16032.53s -> 16034.77s]  I can't it's it'll be impossible to catch up
[16038.15s -> 16041.91s]  Even if we did it like every other day or or twice a week three times a week
[16042.07s -> 16047.44s]  There's this three months before I left of content and then when I got back
[16048.80s -> 16056.79s]  You're talking about I was we were already two or three months behind. There's probably six months of artwork and videos
[16058.37s -> 16063.48s]  So I have to think of a solution there how i'm going to do that and the best one I can think of is
[16063.96s -> 16065.72s]  Because I don't want people to get
[16065.96s -> 16073.97s]  Community content exhaustion. It's one of the reasons why I broke this stream up into two after, you know, four or five six hours
[16074.77s -> 16080.42s]  Of I don't want to just be scanning through pieces of artwork three four times a week
[16081.14s -> 16083.78s]  Because if people do an art piece of art for this channel
[16084.68s -> 16088.36s]  I want someone to see it and I want it obviously to be like, oh well look that's cool
[16089.00s -> 16091.00s]  But I don't want to exhaust everybody with like
[16092.08s -> 16094.24s]  Okay, we're gonna we're gonna play a video game today
[16094.32s -> 16096.72s]  And then the next two days are going to be artwork and videos
[16099.67s -> 16103.59s]  And I don't want to me personally be sitting there going skip skip skip skip skip skip I gotta go fucking fast
[16103.59s -> 16107.72s]  There's 3 000 of these. Hey, thanks. Hey, thanks. Hey, thanks. Hey, thanks
[16107.72s -> 16110.92s]  Hey, no, I don't want to do that because I obviously if you took the time to do it
[16110.92s -> 16113.14s]  I would want you to I don't want to just skip through you
[16117.54s -> 16121.68s]  Play it already. We're going over the future of the community content stuff, man. Come on
[16124.50s -> 16128.61s]  Uh, let's watch the last one. This is the germa bowl and then I'll put the link in chat
[16129.17s -> 16134.26s]  And we will say our goodbyes. Thanks again, everybody
[16135.12s -> 16138.12s]  Excellent fucking work. You floor me every time
[16139.19s -> 16141.19s]  My face hurts my chest hurts
[16141.43s -> 16146.07s]  Everything just hurts. I'm gonna take a bath after this. Here we go
[16155.14s -> 16160.26s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is anthony wimbles and coming at you with a shoutcast our germa 95 seattle
[16160.42s -> 16163.30s]  I got a lot of requests to get back into this and do another shoutcast
[16163.38s -> 16168.18s]  So i'm gonna start it here we go. One, two, three, four five. Let's do it. Are you fucking serious right now?
[16170.66s -> 16186.40s]  Get out of here two players
[16212.60s -> 16233.97s]  Wait what unfortunately
[16234.05s -> 16236.77s]  Your saturday football game is gonna get potentially rained out
[16241.76s -> 16245.01s]  Okay, that's it
[16245.01s -> 16248.37s]  Great honor to meet you, sir. Peter. I hear you fight the scientist
[16249.33s -> 16254.77s]  Well, i'm something of a scientist myself. I read all your research on nanotechnology really brilliant
[16256.61s -> 16259.73s]  Okay
[16259.73s -> 16262.08s]  Oh
[16262.08s -> 16264.08s]  Yeah, the playlist is in the chat right now
[16265.24s -> 16269.94s]  That was a ton of fun. It saddens me that this is the
[16270.82s -> 16272.34s]  second and final
[16272.34s -> 16276.52s]  Part one and then part two
[16276.52s -> 16278.52s]  But that doesn't mean we won't do this again
[16278.52s -> 16284.34s]  I think every year or two
[16284.82s -> 16286.82s]  Going in front of the screen and doing a ton more stuff
[16287.54s -> 16290.55s]  I'm cool with that
[16290.55s -> 16292.92s]  And then obviously stuff for community content
[16293.48s -> 16295.65s]  Nights and purposes. Yes
