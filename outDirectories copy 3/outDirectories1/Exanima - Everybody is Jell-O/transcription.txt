[0.00s -> 16.09s]  Alright, let's take a look here. I can swing left. I can swing right. I can swing down.
[16.09s -> 27.56s]  Can I swing up? Not really, but this is extremely awkward.
[27.56s -> 36.81s]  What is my guy doing right now? Who is winning this fight? Did he just knock it out of my
[36.81s -> 47.42s]  hand? Can I get a stick? Oh, a stick! Give me the stick. Give me the stick. Give me the
[47.42s -> 57.16s]  stick. Have I been up and spotted? These guys aren't hostile. Oh, okay, cool. These guys
[57.16s -> 65.85s]  are not hostile. Excellent. Now they are. Should I run from this? I feel like I need
[65.85s -> 77.01s]  to run and not like... Alright, let's do it. I'm almost dead. I'm dead again. Holy shit.
[77.01s -> 83.82s]  Just be on your way, game. I can't die here. If I die here, I'm going to be extremely upset
[83.82s -> 90.41s]  considering... Do I attack this guy? I kind of have to. He's looking at me weird. I gotta
[91.21s -> 105.08s]  Here he comes. Come on. Come on. I missed. I missed and I'm going to die for it. Damn
[105.08s -> 116.30s]  it! I don't know what I did. I did something wrong. I feel like I'm a little kid in a Halloween
[116.30s -> 122.19s]  costume his mother made for him. Oh, sure, honey. You're a Power Ranger. Yeah, you are.
[122.19s -> 138.70s]  I promise. You're not a box. Did the other kids make fun of you? Keep moving. Keep going.
[140.90s -> 145.70s]  This might be a bad time, but can you give me some directions out of here? I'm kind of
[145.70s -> 151.38s]  lost and I can't see because there's a box on my head, but if you can lead me out... Ow, my hand.
[152.10s -> 168.98s]  I don't even think he can hurt me. He can't hit me. You have never seen my impenetrable box fought
[168.98s -> 177.78s]  like this before. I'm going to sit here until this guy hurts me. Oh, he's getting through.
[177.78s -> 192.78s]  I wonder, can I swing back? See if I can fight back. I don't think so. I can't fight back.
[197.53s -> 200.65s]  Oh, wait, he's getting around. Hey, cut it out.
[205.34s -> 217.85s]  Go run. Run. Stop running into walls, please. And just escape. Escape this horrible castle.
[219.56s -> 231.61s]  Get away from me, you cretin. No. I am going to club this guy. Just wait till this guy makes
[231.61s -> 238.14s]  his way around this corner. I'm going to smash this guy's skull and he's going to wish he was
[238.14s -> 243.50s]  never born. So let's just pretend like we don't want to hurt this guy and he's going to keep
[243.50s -> 253.46s]  walking. No, he's not. Here we go. You want to see how I do things? Oh, my God. I can't even do it.
[253.46s -> 261.06s]  I'm already dead. I wanted to sledgehammer the guy and the guy was holding it like a
[261.06s -> 264.82s]  pool cue for a second and he didn't even reach back. I'm trying to do like the swing with the
[264.82s -> 273.08s]  physics. I forgot to put clothes on before I came into the arena. I've got like a big diaper on.
[275.72s -> 286.63s]  Oh, come on. Get away from the wall. Get away from the wall. All right. Go back right. Nice.
[286.63s -> 299.29s]  Nice. Okay. I'm just turning into the Star Wars kid at this point. That old like internet video.
[299.29s -> 319.99s]  I won. What the hell? I haven't beaten this guy. I have not beaten this guy. This guy's got the
[319.99s -> 333.38s]  shield. Shit. My face got stuck in his shield. That's horse shit. Whoa. Oh, come on. What the
[333.38s -> 344.15s]  fuck was that? Protect yourself. Damn it. Oh, this game is so hard.
