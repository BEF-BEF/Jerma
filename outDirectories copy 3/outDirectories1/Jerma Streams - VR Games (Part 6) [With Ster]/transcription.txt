[2.36s -> 6.36s]  Sorry guys, we were having a little tech talk.
[6.36s -> 11.50s]  T-E-C-H. Ster's trying to figure out some tech.
[11.50s -> 15.50s]  He's trying to figure out how to get his tech working.
[15.50s -> 19.50s]  Spoiler for everybody here, he didn't get to use his tech.
[19.50s -> 26.49s]  It's still not in a good functioning state, unfortunately.
[26.49s -> 30.49s]  Wait, wait, wait, it's not over. The stream is not over.
[30.49s -> 36.12s]  We just started. Hey, there we are.
[36.12s -> 41.19s]  Hi guys. This time I'm back here with Ster.
[41.19s -> 45.62s]  Who is in fact streaming today.
[45.62s -> 51.19s]  From what I understand. What I've been told.
[51.19s -> 56.33s]  We're going to jump right in to pick up what we left off yesterday.
[56.33s -> 60.33s]  Unless he's got anything to say.
[60.33s -> 64.33s]  Everything I'm going to say is a technical problem.
[64.33s -> 68.76s]  So I'm just going to let everyone know.
[68.76s -> 73.90s]  I don't care and I'm ignoring them all.
[73.90s -> 78.14s]  I've had my little headset handbag in my hands here.
[78.14s -> 82.14s]  I've been sitting here waiting for you.
[82.14s -> 86.14s]  I'm ready. How do we join up in game?
[86.14s -> 90.14s]  See you tomorrow. See you in 40 minutes.
[90.14s -> 94.14s]  I have no idea. Let's get in.
[94.14s -> 98.14s]  Are you ready to go in?
[98.14s -> 108.70s]  Shit. Sorry we're a little late.
[108.70s -> 114.79s]  You know what's great about not using a webcam is you just, I'm nude.
[114.79s -> 118.79s]  No one's going to know. Wait, how do you not do a VR stream
[118.79s -> 122.79s]  without a webcam? You've got to have the people watch you do the funny movements.
[122.79s -> 126.79s]  Do you want to wait another 20 minutes? No.
[126.79s -> 134.49s]  No. Alright, I'm going in.
[134.49s -> 138.49s]  This is called Clash of Chefs?
[138.49s -> 143.24s]  I don't know. It's a game where we have to compete and cook food together.
[143.24s -> 147.24s]  Just hold on. Against each other. Not together.
[147.24s -> 151.24s]  Wait, this is not a together game? This is an against game? This is not a together game.
[151.24s -> 155.24s]  Really? I think we're on opposite sides of the room
[155.24s -> 159.24s]  and we're trying to cook the things faster. Your shirt is too small.
[159.24s -> 163.99s]  You want to wait another 20 minutes while I go get another shirt?
[163.99s -> 167.99s]  No. The dryer.
[167.99s -> 171.99s]  That's the advantage right there.
[171.99s -> 175.99s]  Wait, is this the right hand?
[175.99s -> 179.99s]  Guys, something you've got to know about buying shirts. I learned this first hand with this one.
[179.99s -> 183.99s]  First of all, if you buy a medium it's going to turn into a small
[183.99s -> 189.90s]  and don't leave it in the dryer for too long.
[189.90s -> 193.90s]  I like this shirt, okay? It has to be form factor.
[193.90s -> 197.90s]  So my perspiration doesn't get stuck in there.
[197.90s -> 202.39s]  Whatever, I don't give a shit.
[202.39s -> 206.39s]  You can make fun of my baby shirt all you want.
[206.39s -> 211.66s]  Just wait until you see me cook up a couple of dogs here.
[211.66s -> 218.18s]  Alright, this music is going to drive me insane, I can already tell you that.
[218.18s -> 224.71s]  Are you in my game? No.
[224.71s -> 228.71s]  I'm going in. How do we do this?
[228.71s -> 233.02s]  I'm going in.
[233.02s -> 237.45s]  Is this frame rating? That's what I said. Do you have the window on your desktop?
[237.45s -> 241.45s]  Did you close it or did you minimize it?
[241.45s -> 245.45s]  I didn't minimize it, I dragged it to almost non-existent.
[245.45s -> 249.45s]  So I minimized it? Yeah. Open it up and shrink it.
[249.45s -> 254.14s]  And then my game stopped lagging. Really?
[254.14s -> 259.85s]  Shrink it to barely existence and then move it off the screen?
[259.85s -> 264.66s]  Yeah. I have it as a 10 by 10 window.
[264.66s -> 268.66s]  That's very oddly specific how that is.
[268.66s -> 274.04s]  Did you minimize it after that?
[274.04s -> 279.18s]  Actually it is really frame rating. Maybe it's just the game.
[279.18s -> 284.63s]  I think it's just the game. We'll get in and see what happens.
[284.63s -> 288.94s]  Because my CPU is at like 11%.
[288.94s -> 292.94s]  My CPU is better than your CPU. That helped a lot actually.
[292.94s -> 296.94s]  That fixed it for me. Yeah, dropping that.
[296.94s -> 301.30s]  Let's go.
[301.30s -> 306.25s]  Play online. Invite?
[306.25s -> 311.24s]  Or should I just invite you?
[311.24s -> 315.54s]  You are none of these people.
[315.54s -> 321.94s]  Do you want to invite me?
[321.94s -> 326.57s]  Play. Invite.
[326.57s -> 333.42s]  Are you online?
[333.42s -> 337.42s]  What is this?
[337.42s -> 341.42s]  Am I cooking a stack of bacon? How do I get one piece of bacon?
[341.42s -> 345.42s]  Sure enough.
[345.42s -> 349.78s]  Are you online on Steam?
[349.78s -> 354.47s]  I should be.
[354.47s -> 361.85s]  I don't see anybody named Tommy Pickles.
[361.85s -> 368.89s]  I should be.
[368.89s -> 372.89s]  I don't know how to do any of this.
[372.89s -> 378.47s]  Why can I not open my Steam?
[378.47s -> 386.36s]  Why can I not open Steam?
[386.36s -> 396.55s]  I don't want to open a mobile hotspot.
[396.55s -> 400.92s]  You can spend weeks preparing.
[400.92s -> 407.02s]  I'm signed in now.
[407.02s -> 411.90s]  You're online?
[411.90s -> 415.90s]  Invite. There he is.
[415.90s -> 433.64s]  Waiting for a friend. Meet me at the bar.
[433.64s -> 437.64s]  Okay, I'm here.
[437.64s -> 444.12s]  Friend invited you. Please yes, go.
[444.12s -> 448.12s]  Please yes, let's go.
[448.12s -> 452.12s]  Why am I this small? I'm not this small.
[452.12s -> 456.12s]  You are. No, I'm not this small.
[456.12s -> 460.81s]  Who is that? Is that us?
[460.81s -> 465.37s]  We just determined who us was.
[465.37s -> 469.37s]  Is this a surveillance camera of what we were doing?
[469.37s -> 474.25s]  We're getting orders.
[474.25s -> 478.81s]  Are you sure we're getting orders?
[478.81s -> 482.81s]  How do you play?
[482.81s -> 486.81s]  He wants a cup of busted and he wants a burger with
[486.81s -> 490.81s]  these customers.
[490.81s -> 494.81s]  These are pre-sliced?
[494.81s -> 498.81s]  Who does that?
[498.81s -> 502.81s]  You don't use your bare hand.
[502.81s -> 506.81s]  Where's my spatula?
[506.81s -> 510.81s]  He's down here.
[510.81s -> 519.13s]  That doesn't take very long at all.
[519.13s -> 527.34s]  Where's the trash?
[527.34s -> 531.77s]  That's his group.
[531.77s -> 537.22s]  There's going to be a fire.
[537.22s -> 541.22s]  These take two seconds. We've got cheese, two buns.
[541.22s -> 545.40s]  Done. Bingo.
[545.40s -> 549.70s]  Cheese.
[549.70s -> 553.70s]  Cheese.
[553.70s -> 557.70s]  No, this is the wrong bun.
[557.70s -> 566.68s]  Where's the aioli?
[566.68s -> 571.75s]  How do burgers burn this bad?
[571.75s -> 575.75s]  This one's easy. Shake this off.
[575.75s -> 588.74s]  Just burn it off.
[588.74s -> 594.23s]  It's going to be done.
[594.23s -> 598.23s]  Tutorials up.
[598.23s -> 602.73s]  I've got to toast these buns.
[602.73s -> 613.88s]  Where's the trash?
[613.88s -> 618.12s]  I just need
[618.12s -> 623.64s]  fresh hamburgers.
[623.64s -> 631.46s]  I'm not agreeing with the physics.
[631.46s -> 635.46s]  How do I pick this up without it dropping?
[635.46s -> 639.46s]  I did that one.
[639.46s -> 649.45s]  I've got to season the grill.
[649.45s -> 656.23s]  What is in here?
[656.23s -> 660.92s]  How did it go through the grate?
[660.92s -> 664.92s]  I don't even know what that is.
[664.92s -> 668.92s]  Will you come get this burger?
[668.92s -> 674.18s]  Right here. I got one right here for you.
[674.18s -> 687.94s]  What?
[687.94s -> 692.18s]  Are we supposed to make all three on the screen?
[692.18s -> 696.18s]  The ones that are right out here.
[696.18s -> 706.87s]  How come it takes longer to fill a cup with a drink
[706.87s -> 710.87s]  than it does to cook a hamburger?
[710.87s -> 716.95s]  Because it's a fucking video game.
[716.95s -> 722.01s]  Take it.
[722.01s -> 726.01s]  How many red sixes do you have?
[726.01s -> 730.01s]  I need a plate.
[730.01s -> 734.01s]  I need a plate.
[734.01s -> 738.01s]  What?
[738.01s -> 744.34s]  This just came in.
[744.34s -> 748.34s]  I've done the thing.
[748.34s -> 752.34s]  Are these green?
[752.34s -> 756.65s]  Oh my god.
[756.65s -> 760.65s]  Who needs plates?
[760.65s -> 764.65s]  You're being back VR. Does that mean that she's grabbing you from behind
[764.65s -> 768.65s]  and moving your shoulders?
[768.65s -> 772.65s]  The air is making this fall. I didn't make that fall.
[772.65s -> 782.04s]  What is doing this fall?
[782.04s -> 787.80s]  I found out how to play.
[787.80s -> 805.27s]  I'm serious. I don't know how to play the game.
[805.27s -> 810.66s]  What do you mean you win?
[810.66s -> 814.66s]  It's giving me the advanced super lag mode.
[814.66s -> 818.66s]  What did you do?
[818.66s -> 822.66s]  I got an order in.
[822.66s -> 827.66s]  Why?
[827.66s -> 835.22s]  I can't look at this.
[835.22s -> 845.85s]  Play next match.
[845.85s -> 849.85s]  My board is blank.
[849.85s -> 853.85s]  It's the paddy. What is that? Did I do it?
[853.85s -> 858.79s]  I think I might have fucked up the game.
[858.79s -> 864.62s]  I think the game is broken.
[864.62s -> 869.82s]  Why are these green?
[869.82s -> 873.82s]  This is getting weird.
[873.82s -> 878.38s]  I'm out of here.
[878.38s -> 883.38s]  You're gone.
[883.38s -> 888.52s]  We didn't get to do anything.
[888.52s -> 902.60s]  My game doesn't work.
[902.60s -> 906.60s]  I invited you.
[906.60s -> 910.60s]  I think I see you operating a table.
[910.60s -> 914.60s]  Now invite me.
[914.60s -> 918.60s]  I didn't do anything.
[918.60s -> 932.18s]  Did something pop up?
[932.18s -> 941.10s]  Did I invite shortboard?
[941.10s -> 945.10s]  I just got a message of what the fuck.
[945.10s -> 949.10s]  I'm pretty sure I clicked on you.
[949.10s -> 953.10s]  Can we play the next game?
[953.10s -> 957.10s]  Friend invite.
[957.10s -> 961.10s]  My game is still 10 frames a second.
[961.10s -> 965.10s]  Why are you persisting?
[965.10s -> 969.10s]  We can't do that.
[969.10s -> 973.72s]  That's going to cause real sickness.
[973.72s -> 977.72s]  I won.
[977.72s -> 982.47s]  I feel so much better to be in 60 fps.
[982.47s -> 987.16s]  What do you want to go next?
[987.16s -> 992.47s]  Climbing?
[992.47s -> 996.47s]  Let's do climbing.
[996.47s -> 1010.94s]  I don't know.
[1010.94s -> 1021.37s]  Maybe.
[1021.37s -> 1026.63s]  We wait for him to return.
[1026.63s -> 1030.81s]  Video games are too hard.
[1030.81s -> 1040.58s]  He's not in discord anymore.
[1040.58s -> 1047.62s]  Maybe that's what was causing all the lag.
[1047.62s -> 1053.19s]  It's possible.
[1053.19s -> 1062.28s]  I wonder if he's going to come back.
[1062.28s -> 1070.30s]  Do dreadhalls while you wait?
[1070.30s -> 1074.30s]  I'll do tilt brush.
[1074.30s -> 1086.71s]  I need to open my library.
[1086.71s -> 1094.65s]  Chef VR
[1094.65s -> 1098.65s]  blue screens his game.
[1098.65s -> 1105.88s]  He was underwater in that game for too long.
[1105.88s -> 1116.14s]  Let's open up tilt brush.
[1116.14s -> 1121.40s]  I've never played it before.
[1121.40s -> 1125.40s]  My computer
[1125.40s -> 1132.04s]  had an oopsie.
[1132.04s -> 1137.37s]  That's probably what was killing us.
[1137.37s -> 1141.37s]  Really?
[1141.37s -> 1146.95s]  It wouldn't close.
[1146.95s -> 1152.90s]  My VR crashed.
[1152.90s -> 1157.59s]  Why? You just infected me.
[1157.59s -> 1164.17s]  You infected me.
[1164.17s -> 1169.62s]  My OVR drop just crashed.
[1169.62s -> 1175.19s]  Let's play that virus game again.
[1175.19s -> 1179.19s]  It keeps you there thinking you're making cheeseburgers.
[1179.19s -> 1186.38s]  Hold on.
[1186.38s -> 1191.24s]  Where's my hand?
[1191.24s -> 1199.75s]  I have to set this back up.
[1199.75s -> 1207.06s]  Where are you guys?
[1207.06s -> 1211.06s]  I've got to load my chat profile.
[1211.06s -> 1233.32s]  Why did the chef game have to do this to us?
[1233.32s -> 1239.29s]  It completely logged me out of steam.
[1239.29s -> 1243.29s]  It completely logged me out of steam. I don't know my password.
[1243.29s -> 1249.64s]  Hold on. What are you talking about?
[1249.64s -> 1261.34s]  Do you really get logged out of steam?
[1261.34s -> 1266.54s]  How did you get logged out of steam?
[1266.54s -> 1279.48s]  Tell me that I got my serial key and my card numbers.
[1279.48s -> 1286.50s]  For the love of god.
[1286.50s -> 1293.94s]  Technical difficulty stream welcome.
[1293.94s -> 1300.74s]  I had a profile saved.
[1300.74s -> 1311.51s]  Why is it not here?
[1311.51s -> 1323.18s]  I'm playing the claw game right now.
[1323.18s -> 1337.11s]  Hopefully I win the big teddy bear.
[1337.11s -> 1343.46s]  Why don't you have a stronger password?
[1343.46s -> 1353.62s]  Are you still here?
[1353.62s -> 1362.33s]  Is he gone?
[1362.33s -> 1368.34s]  He might be gone again.
[1368.34s -> 1379.42s]  Are we infected?
[1379.42s -> 1389.66s]  I think he's the only one that's infected.
[1389.66s -> 1394.28s]  I'm going to open up tilt brush and wait for him to tell me everything is okay.
[1394.28s -> 1413.59s]  This is actually kind of scary.
[1413.59s -> 1421.40s]  I don't think we are infected.
[1421.40s -> 1432.55s]  Let's relax while we wait.
[1432.55s -> 1441.13s]  The star is still technically in discord.
[1441.13s -> 1445.30s]  Maybe when we figure it out, we'll hear him.
[1445.30s -> 1452.28s]  That's not him.
[1452.28s -> 1459.85s]  Let's see what this game is.
[1459.85s -> 1466.84s]  Tilt brush. I heard it was very relaxing.
[1466.84s -> 1472.47s]  Trigger to paint.
[1472.47s -> 1479.19s]  You hold the trigger down to paint.
[1479.19s -> 1486.63s]  This is unbelievable.
[1486.63s -> 1493.03s]  Swipe thumb pad.
[1493.03s -> 1497.03s]  Straight edges.
[1497.03s -> 1506.82s]  Mirror.
[1506.82s -> 1511.58s]  Night sky.
[1511.58s -> 1520.60s]  I'm going to make my t-shirt.
[1520.60s -> 1524.60s]  How do I erase?
[1524.60s -> 1532.78s]  That's really cool.
[1532.78s -> 1540.58s]  Why does it keep changing?
[1540.58s -> 1547.13s]  It's there.
[1547.13s -> 1551.50s]  Color pick.
[1551.50s -> 1555.50s]  What color do I want to smoke?
[1555.50s -> 1559.50s]  There's a little bit of smokiness here.
[1559.50s -> 1569.46s]  No, that's not going to work.
[1569.46s -> 1574.65s]  I need to make the brush bigger.
[1574.65s -> 1581.77s]  How do I do that?
[1581.77s -> 1586.39s]  Hard press left side of left touchpad to undo.
[1586.39s -> 1595.34s]  That looks good.
[1595.34s -> 1599.34s]  I'm drawing my t-shirt now.
[1599.34s -> 1609.45s]  You're having a little bit of trouble there.
[1609.45s -> 1615.03s]  There's my shirt.
[1615.03s -> 1622.41s]  This is amazing.
[1622.41s -> 1634.18s]  Can you come into my game and do this with me?
[1634.18s -> 1641.05s]  This is the real star. Do you want to play a game?
[1641.05s -> 1645.54s]  Let's play Climbing.
[1645.54s -> 1656.09s]  Snow?
[1656.09s -> 1660.09s]  This is really cool. Unfortunately, star is back.
[1660.09s -> 1664.71s]  I'm sorry.
[1664.71s -> 1669.02s]  Tilt brush.
[1669.02s -> 1674.52s]  Medium are quite nice.
[1674.52s -> 1680.23s]  Are you ready for climbing?
[1680.23s -> 1684.41s]  I am in climbing.
[1684.41s -> 1690.10s]  I am sure about that.
[1690.10s -> 1694.41s]  There was a foreign man at my front door.
[1694.41s -> 1698.41s]  I gave him my social security and he said now I can play again.
[1698.41s -> 1702.41s]  Is this you talking?
[1702.41s -> 1707.80s]  This is me talking.
[1707.80s -> 1716.31s]  This is a weird scenario here.
[1716.31s -> 1720.87s]  Are you ready to play this game together?
[1720.87s -> 1724.87s]  I'm ready to play this game together.
[1724.87s -> 1728.87s]  This is called Climbing and it's not what my current game title is.
[1728.87s -> 1734.90s]  Floor, grid, clothes, robot, cam.
[1734.90s -> 1739.34s]  What does cam do?
[1739.34s -> 1746.38s]  Turn off camera.
[1746.38s -> 1752.02s]  How do we get into the same game?
[1752.02s -> 1756.71s]  Let's get started.
[1756.71s -> 1760.71s]  My camera is telling me I'm not live.
[1760.71s -> 1764.71s]  Now they're telling me I'm live.
[1764.71s -> 1768.71s]  I'm going to stream VR again.
[1768.71s -> 1779.72s]  He said grip and then what do we do?
[1779.72s -> 1783.72s]  Get the fuck out of my face.
[1783.72s -> 1787.72s]  Climb up using the trigger button.
[1787.72s -> 1794.46s]  This is really cool.
[1794.46s -> 1798.46s]  I sure wish one of my friends was around to play this with me.
[1798.46s -> 1802.46s]  Where's the tutorial?
[1802.46s -> 1806.46s]  Help me.
[1806.46s -> 1810.46s]  There's no start button.
[1810.46s -> 1815.72s]  Help me.
[1815.72s -> 1819.72s]  Where are you?
[1819.72s -> 1823.72s]  I'm in the big world.
[1823.72s -> 1827.72s]  Hold on.
[1827.72s -> 1831.72s]  I can't move.
[1831.72s -> 1835.72s]  I'm going to have to do this again.
[1835.72s -> 1839.72s]  I'm going to star the technically illiterate guy.
[1839.72s -> 1843.72s]  He doesn't even know how to set up his virtual headset.
[1843.72s -> 1849.43s]  How do I move?
[1849.43s -> 1853.43s]  This game is going to be real fun.
[1853.43s -> 1857.43s]  It's like climbing.
[1857.43s -> 1865.05s]  I made it.
[1865.05s -> 1869.05s]  Jump climbing.
[1869.05s -> 1873.05s]  Remember when Valve made games?
[1873.05s -> 1877.05s]  Or when we made the portal?
[1877.05s -> 1881.05s]  Am I in a tutorial?
[1881.05s -> 1885.05s]  You have Wheatley talking to you.
[1885.05s -> 1891.46s]  Wheatley with the helmet on.
[1891.46s -> 1895.46s]  Do what Wheatley tells you and then we'll probably get into a game.
[1895.46s -> 1901.11s]  He's standing in front of me but he wants me to jump forward.
[1901.11s -> 1909.64s]  Get out of me.
[1909.64s -> 1913.82s]  I already made that joke.
[1913.82s -> 1920.92s]  What joke?
[1920.92s -> 1924.92s]  He's body blocking me.
[1924.92s -> 1936.49s]  How do I get out of here?
[1936.49s -> 1943.54s]  Up there.
[1943.54s -> 1951.86s]  You can't do that.
[1951.86s -> 1957.32s]  Did you make it?
[1957.32s -> 1963.21s]  Why are you like a baby?
[1963.21s -> 1967.21s]  I just wanted things to work.
[1967.21s -> 1971.21s]  It's a marvelous invention.
[1971.21s -> 1976.15s]  Go for it.
[1976.15s -> 1980.15s]  I have to complete the tutorial first.
[1980.15s -> 1996.09s]  Oh no.
[1996.09s -> 2009.30s]  What?
[2009.30s -> 2015.00s]  Listen to the baby.
[2015.00s -> 2019.62s]  Stop that. You want your bottle?
[2019.62s -> 2030.33s]  I'm not doing that anymore.
[2030.33s -> 2041.85s]  How do I get over there?
[2041.85s -> 2045.85s]  Is this really a tutorial?
[2045.85s -> 2049.85s]  It's teaching you how to climb and grab and move.
[2049.85s -> 2053.85s]  It's a little more challenging than the others.
[2053.85s -> 2057.85s]  Remember you can put that up to 3 checkpoints per level.
[2057.85s -> 2061.85s]  If you just push the menu button.
[2061.85s -> 2065.85s]  Checkpoints make it so you don't have to restart the entire level.
[2065.85s -> 2069.85s]  Use them wisely and you'll be much less frustrated by difficult levels.
[2069.85s -> 2073.85s]  Just stand on it.
[2073.85s -> 2086.47s]  I almost ripped the headset off.
[2086.47s -> 2094.98s]  This is actually fucking cool. You don't like this?
[2094.98s -> 2098.98s]  I just want to play with my friend.
[2098.98s -> 2105.00s]  I'm alone. I can't even see chat or anything.
[2105.00s -> 2113.77s]  I just feel like a dumbass.
[2113.77s -> 2117.77s]  If you press the button to rotate while you're on the moving platform you fall off.
[2117.77s -> 2122.01s]  What are you talking about?
[2122.01s -> 2126.01s]  If you try and turn your character I just fall off.
[2126.01s -> 2132.36s]  I'm almost done with the tutorial.
[2132.36s -> 2140.68s]  Good thing I can see my chat.
[2140.68s -> 2148.60s]  I don't have a checkpoint.
[2148.60s -> 2166.33s]  Am I okay?
[2166.33s -> 2174.54s]  Just make sure to not orientate yourself and punch my wall.
[2174.54s -> 2179.61s]  We have to work together and shit.
[2179.61s -> 2189.67s]  I don't even know where I am in my room.
[2189.67s -> 2206.82s]  Be careful.
[2206.82s -> 2212.28s]  How come every game you can't do a tutorial with a friend?
[2212.28s -> 2217.29s]  To give you confidence.
[2217.29s -> 2233.67s]  I'm almost done with it.
[2233.67s -> 2237.98s]  This is the hard part.
[2237.98s -> 2248.09s]  Only two more of this shit and I'm good.
[2248.09s -> 2255.51s]  Last one.
[2255.51s -> 2263.66s]  Let's try.
[2263.66s -> 2267.66s]  Let you be free and play the game as you wish.
[2267.66s -> 2271.66s]  In any sort of way.
[2271.66s -> 2279.67s]  Not tutorial.
[2279.67s -> 2298.47s]  Set checkpoints with your wrist.
[2298.47s -> 2302.78s]  How do I get this off?
[2302.78s -> 2308.66s]  Listen.
[2308.66s -> 2316.09s]  Main menu.
[2316.09s -> 2321.74s]  Servers.
[2321.74s -> 2325.74s]  Go to the main menu.
[2325.74s -> 2329.74s]  I'm doing my jumps.
[2329.74s -> 2333.74s]  I'm doing my solo exercise.
[2333.74s -> 2341.21s]  Start server browser.
[2341.21s -> 2345.21s]  There are three people looking for a server.
[2345.21s -> 2351.74s]  I'm coming in your room.
[2351.74s -> 2357.00s]  I'm joining you right now.
[2357.00s -> 2361.18s]  I feel like you lied to me.
[2361.18s -> 2365.18s]  Open a room.
[2365.18s -> 2369.18s]  You're going to have to explain.
[2369.18s -> 2373.42s]  Select a level.
[2373.42s -> 2377.42s]  Start from the beginning.
[2377.42s -> 2381.42s]  Hit the menu button.
[2381.42s -> 2385.42s]  Activate main menu.
[2385.42s -> 2389.42s]  Select the built in ones.
[2389.42s -> 2399.42s]  My hand buzzes when I click main menu and I can't leave.
[2399.42s -> 2404.81s]  I'm in the main menu.
[2404.81s -> 2408.81s]  I'm in the main menu.
[2408.81s -> 2412.81s]  Go to built in mode.
[2412.81s -> 2416.81s]  You have a selection of levels here.
[2416.81s -> 2420.81s]  Click on 001 climbing 101.
[2420.81s -> 2424.81s]  That's the first one.
[2424.81s -> 2428.81s]  Do 002 jumping 101.
[2428.81s -> 2432.81s]  Do 006 climb stuff.
[2432.81s -> 2436.81s]  Get in there.
[2436.81s -> 2447.38s]  Go.
[2447.38s -> 2451.38s]  New play.
[2451.38s -> 2457.29s]  Go to create private room.
[2457.29s -> 2461.29s]  To the left.
[2461.29s -> 2471.86s]  Create public, create private.
[2471.86s -> 2475.86s]  You're standing at the built in with all the buttons to press.
[2475.86s -> 2479.86s]  Go like this.
[2479.86s -> 2483.86s]  Go like what?
[2483.86s -> 2488.04s]  Movie, TV show.
[2488.04s -> 2494.57s]  Seinfeld.
[2494.57s -> 2499.13s]  Labyrinth.
[2499.13s -> 2503.13s]  I only had a heart.
[2503.13s -> 2508.78s]  Wizard of Oz.
[2508.78s -> 2513.14s]  Turn to your left.
[2513.14s -> 2520.82s]  Create public and create private room.
[2520.82s -> 2527.05s]  Sometimes with this guy, sometimes with him.
[2527.05s -> 2531.74s]  I'm in.
[2531.74s -> 2538.07s]  Turn around and see your new best friend.
[2538.07s -> 2542.07s]  You can hear me in the game too, like every VR game.
[2542.07s -> 2546.25s]  They don't expect you to be in a discord on a stream.
[2546.25s -> 2553.74s]  Where's the options? Input.
[2553.74s -> 2562.06s]  Mic, turn it off. To the top left.
[2562.06s -> 2566.06s]  It's me and you.
[2566.06s -> 2571.83s]  What do I have to flare?
[2571.83s -> 2575.83s]  The thing on your right shoulder strap.
[2575.83s -> 2579.83s]  You have a thing that says vibe.
[2579.83s -> 2583.83s]  Let's pick a level.
[2583.83s -> 2588.78s]  Family guy joke.
[2588.78s -> 2593.51s]  Family guy routine.
[2593.51s -> 2603.19s]  Pick one.
[2603.19s -> 2610.12s]  It's going to be so funny.
[2610.12s -> 2614.12s]  Can you pick a level?
[2614.12s -> 2618.12s]  I'll do it.
[2618.12s -> 2623.64s]  I don't understand.
[2623.64s -> 2627.64s]  After selecting the levels you want, press the menu button.
[2627.64s -> 2638.60s]  Don't read it.
[2638.60s -> 2643.29s]  Just the way to get it so we can play.
[2643.29s -> 2647.29s]  I see checkpoint on the top right.
[2647.29s -> 2653.45s]  There's no start.
[2653.45s -> 2662.86s]  It's levels that are available and they're calling you an idiot.
[2662.86s -> 2674.71s]  Top right.
[2674.71s -> 2680.79s]  Look who the fool is.
[2680.79s -> 2687.21s]  Look at this guy.
[2687.21s -> 2691.21s]  There's no level selected.
[2691.21s -> 2703.18s]  Don't touch anything.
[2703.18s -> 2709.46s]  Player scale 1.5. Look up.
[2709.46s -> 2713.77s]  We have a list here.
[2713.77s -> 2721.98s]  Wait. Refresh.
[2721.98s -> 2725.98s]  Can't we just start at 006?
[2725.98s -> 2729.98s]  Why did our games decide to undo everything that had been learned
[2729.98s -> 2733.98s]  from making menus and UI in games?
[2733.98s -> 2745.56s]  Gullible is written on the ceiling.
[2745.56s -> 2759.14s]  I'll handle this.
[2759.14s -> 2765.03s]  You ready?
[2765.03s -> 2769.03s]  I have a suggestion for the developers.
[2769.03s -> 2773.03s]  This whole wall should be a button that says play.
[2773.03s -> 2777.03s]  This one should be the mission you started.
[2777.03s -> 2790.02s]  Turn off 1.5 times player scale.
[2790.02s -> 2794.02s]  It's your lobby so you have to start the game.
[2794.02s -> 2809.90s]  You have to open up your wrist watch menu and hit start.
[2809.90s -> 2814.20s]  Nothing says start.
[2814.20s -> 2819.78s]  We're here. 006.
[2819.78s -> 2826.49s]  The trick is you press playlist.
[2826.49s -> 2831.88s]  It's like I'm right next to you.
[2831.88s -> 2835.88s]  Are you going to do it?
[2835.88s -> 2839.88s]  Are you going to do this or are we going to just
[2839.88s -> 2850.09s]  get the fuck away from him?
[2850.09s -> 2860.82s]  You just fucking threw me over.
[2860.82s -> 2865.13s]  What the hell are you standing on?
[2865.13s -> 2872.04s]  How come I can't see you on that?
[2872.04s -> 2878.74s]  That's my real wall.
[2878.74s -> 2885.48s]  Be careful. Watch out for the wall.
[2885.48s -> 2893.24s]  That's my wall.
[2893.24s -> 2901.64s]  That's my VR sensor.
[2901.64s -> 2923.02s]  He's breaking his shit. I'll get over there quick.
[2923.02s -> 2942.15s]  I almost fucked it up.
[2942.15s -> 2966.89s]  What?
[2966.89s -> 2976.09s]  Crawl you fool.
[2976.09s -> 2982.70s]  Why do I not have a checkpoint?
[2982.70s -> 2990.12s]  You thought you were going to beat me.
[2990.12s -> 2994.94s]  I grabbed it.
[2994.94s -> 3003.66s]  A store has a checkpoint there.
[3003.66s -> 3007.66s]  We both have our own checkpoints.
[3007.66s -> 3011.96s]  Make your checkpoint.
[3011.96s -> 3020.34s]  I didn't know how to do it.
[3020.34s -> 3024.34s]  Me getting to the end doesn't end the level.
[3024.34s -> 3029.61s]  I'll get there. I was just rushing because I was trying to beat you.
[3029.61s -> 3041.13s]  You didn't.
[3041.13s -> 3046.52s]  Here I am at the checkpoint.
[3046.52s -> 3059.75s]  Where is it?
[3059.75s -> 3064.50s]  Tommy Pickles.
[3064.50s -> 3068.50s]  I didn't know what it was.
[3068.50s -> 3076.20s]  What am I touching?
[3076.20s -> 3091.56s]  Wait over here for you.
[3091.56s -> 3095.56s]  I'm trying to rush so much.
[3095.56s -> 3099.56s]  It's next level.
[3099.56s -> 3111.96s]  Are you ready?
[3111.96s -> 3115.96s]  That's what Mario would do.
[3115.96s -> 3119.96s]  I'm sliding.
[3119.96s -> 3126.81s]  You're trying too hard.
[3126.81s -> 3131.62s]  I'm not doing anything.
[3131.62s -> 3136.06s]  I'm just being pushed around.
[3136.06s -> 3141.45s]  Are you lacking again?
[3141.45s -> 3151.22s]  There you are.
[3151.22s -> 3155.22s]  That's an interesting long way to go.
[3155.22s -> 3164.14s]  This is going to be really interesting here.
[3164.14s -> 3173.61s]  You're going to have to climb.
[3173.61s -> 3187.67s]  I don't think I like this.
[3187.67s -> 3192.94s]  I don't think you should be playing this one.
[3192.94s -> 3207.59s]  You can't do that.
[3207.59s -> 3212.34s]  I'm going to wrap all the way around.
[3212.34s -> 3216.34s]  How are you hitting the ceiling?
[3216.34s -> 3220.34s]  You're not nine feet tall, are you?
[3220.34s -> 3225.40s]  How are you touching your ceiling?
[3225.40s -> 3234.12s]  I'm going to freak out.
[3234.12s -> 3240.07s]  Your arms are longer than mine.
[3240.07s -> 3248.66s]  Can I put a checkpoint here?
[3248.66s -> 3257.69s]  You're going to make me let go.
[3257.69s -> 3269.72s]  From here?
[3269.72s -> 3301.99s]  No!
[3301.99s -> 3307.19s]  What?
[3307.19s -> 3311.69s]  Sometimes you just need to put the radio on and relax.
[3311.69s -> 3319.62s]  What do I do from here?
[3319.62s -> 3336.86s]  No!
[3336.86s -> 3341.80s]  He hit his head on the ceiling and I forgot you could do that.
[3341.80s -> 3346.10s]  I even mentioned it.
[3346.10s -> 3350.98s]  Can I make a checkpoint here?
[3350.98s -> 3356.89s]  It broke his ceiling light and distracted me.
[3356.89s -> 3368.98s]  I'm out of checkpoints.
[3368.98s -> 3383.62s]  This radio sucks.
[3383.62s -> 3389.78s]  Where even are you?
[3389.78s -> 3394.66s]  I went all the way to the beginning because it didn't make one checkpoint.
[3394.66s -> 3398.66s]  You started smashing stuff and I forgot it was a game.
[3398.66s -> 3410.65s]  I hit the wall and I don't know what hand is gripped.
[3410.65s -> 3415.70s]  Which one of these hands is gripping the ceiling?
[3415.70s -> 3422.38s]  I have no idea.
[3422.38s -> 3432.89s]  Why does the game move you when you're in a spot?
[3432.89s -> 3436.89s]  Give me a checkpoint.
[3436.89s -> 3443.10s]  I'm going to put a checkpoint right on top of that.
[3443.10s -> 3451.11s]  Minutes.
[3451.11s -> 3455.35s]  Next level.
[3455.35s -> 3459.72s]  I got to the end.
[3459.72s -> 3465.37s]  I did the whole thing.
[3465.37s -> 3469.54s]  You're a liar.
[3469.54s -> 3473.98s]  I came back because getting to the end doesn't end it.
[3473.98s -> 3478.54s]  I see what happened.
[3478.54s -> 3485.83s]  Movie.
[3485.83s -> 3491.16s]  Ow!
[3491.16s -> 3495.16s]  This is the number one punch your wall game.
[3495.16s -> 3503.61s]  How do we keep doing that?
[3503.61s -> 3516.78s]  I got cute with it.
[3516.78s -> 3523.00s]  Are we going through?
[3523.00s -> 3538.14s]  I'm coming.
[3538.14s -> 3542.74s]  How do we do this?
[3542.74s -> 3553.86s]  Are you putting a checkpoint here?
[3553.86s -> 3562.06s]  VR notifications.
[3562.06s -> 3569.16s]  Get away from me.
[3569.16s -> 3582.79s]  No, I didn't put a checkpoint.
[3582.79s -> 3586.79s]  Why do you keep doing that?
[3586.79s -> 3590.79s]  I don't know.
[3590.79s -> 3594.79s]  I pushed you off the mountain and I forgot.
[3594.79s -> 3602.55s]  I was going to put one down right there.
[3602.55s -> 3606.55s]  Why do I keep doing this?
[3606.55s -> 3612.76s]  I beat it.
[3612.76s -> 3621.03s]  I don't know where I am in my room.
[3621.03s -> 3628.73s]  Just go.
[3628.73s -> 3637.69s]  Unbelievable.
[3637.69s -> 3645.90s]  Why don't you near me?
[3645.90s -> 3668.46s]  That's weird.
[3668.46s -> 3685.80s]  What's the goal here?
[3685.80s -> 3694.44s]  Ow!
[3694.44s -> 3698.44s]  How many holes are we going to have on our walls?
[3698.44s -> 3709.85s]  Weird sex music playing.
[3709.85s -> 3715.69s]  Ow!
[3715.69s -> 3721.13s]  We're going to break something.
[3721.13s -> 3727.35s]  What are you jumping to?
[3727.35s -> 3731.35s]  Why am I jumping sideways?
[3731.35s -> 3744.10s]  How do I jump backwards?
[3744.10s -> 3749.11s]  I got a checkpoint.
[3749.11s -> 3769.91s]  How do you do this?
[3769.91s -> 3777.21s]  Oh my goodness.
[3777.21s -> 3784.01s]  I'm in the opposite direction of what I'm trying to do.
[3784.01s -> 3789.38s]  I can hold onto you.
[3789.38s -> 3797.77s]  How did you do that?
[3797.77s -> 3808.06s]  I had more attempts.
[3808.06s -> 3812.06s]  Don't do it yet.
[3812.06s -> 3817.30s]  It's so difficult.
[3817.30s -> 3829.61s]  Don't go.
[3829.61s -> 3838.01s]  Don't do anything.
[3838.01s -> 3848.25s]  I'm saving you a lot of embarrassment.
[3848.25s -> 3857.42s]  You're going under.
[3857.42s -> 3865.74s]  The level is over under.
[3865.74s -> 3878.42s]  How is he doing this to me?
[3878.42s -> 3884.33s]  I was planning and correcting.
[3884.33s -> 3893.46s]  Where is this going?
[3893.46s -> 3898.46s]  Are there no checkpoints here?
[3898.46s -> 3902.46s]  I tried to press it.
[3902.46s -> 3912.04s]  I'm going under.
[3912.04s -> 3919.27s]  Under this.
[3919.27s -> 3927.21s]  There was a movement platform here.
[3927.21s -> 3935.78s]  On the side?
[3935.78s -> 3945.77s]  That just booted me.
[3945.77s -> 3950.65s]  Did you stuff yourself under here?
[3950.65s -> 3955.08s]  I feel dizzy as hell now.
[3955.08s -> 3959.32s]  My face. Are you lying to me or did you actually do that?
[3959.32s -> 3968.84s]  I did.
[3968.84s -> 3976.73s]  Remember when we used to have an honest relationship?
[3976.73s -> 3993.10s]  Down.
[3993.10s -> 3999.94s]  Where am I?
[3999.94s -> 4007.05s]  Where am I?
[4007.05s -> 4011.05s]  I feel like I went back to the beginning.
[4011.05s -> 4036.04s]  Crawl?
[4036.04s -> 4045.77s]  Why is this working?
[4045.77s -> 4054.92s]  It was a good thing there wasn't a wall in front of me.
[4054.92s -> 4063.18s]  I beat it.
[4063.18s -> 4069.14s]  I couldn't figure out the crawl thing.
[4069.14s -> 4077.51s]  I'm dizzy.
[4077.51s -> 4081.51s]  I'm going to check in on my chat.
[4081.51s -> 4086.07s]  Lose in a children's game.
[4086.07s -> 4105.13s]  This is a workout.
[4105.13s -> 4119.91s]  Oops.
[4119.91s -> 4124.15s]  Lose in a children's game.
[4124.15s -> 4137.54s]  I see your final checkpoint.
[4137.54s -> 4159.43s]  Be easy with this shit.
[4159.43s -> 4167.62s]  How's your chat doing?
[4167.62s -> 4179.85s]  They're great.
[4179.85s -> 4185.99s]  I'm going to assume I should use it right here.
[4185.99s -> 4202.30s]  Hard jump.
[4202.30s -> 4209.72s]  How many more are there?
[4209.72s -> 4221.56s]  There it is.
[4221.56s -> 4241.00s]  Should I put on the dumb music too?
[4241.00s -> 4251.14s]  No.
[4251.14s -> 4266.79s]  How did you get to this?
[4266.79s -> 4270.79s]  Am I actually going to get Lose commercial?
[4270.79s -> 4274.79s]  Are you kidding me?
[4274.79s -> 4278.79s]  This is a real radio station?
[4278.79s -> 4282.79s]  This is a real radio station?
[4282.79s -> 4286.79s]  What are you doing?
[4286.79s -> 4290.79s]  Did you get a Lose advertisement?
[4290.79s -> 4294.79s]  No.
[4294.79s -> 4304.79s]  What is this?
[4304.79s -> 4311.64s]  What's your plan?
[4311.64s -> 4315.64s]  Are you ready?
[4315.64s -> 4326.98s]  You sweaty?
[4326.98s -> 4332.42s]  I did it.
[4332.42s -> 4338.97s]  This is my chance to show everybody that I have what it takes.
[4338.97s -> 4349.14s]  You say one thing about it.
[4349.14s -> 4355.24s]  This shit's moving.
[4355.24s -> 4364.22s]  The moving platform is freaking me out.
[4364.22s -> 4369.86s]  I think I'm on top.
[4369.86s -> 4380.04s]  It's weird.
[4380.04s -> 4385.43s]  I think there is ice.
[4385.43s -> 4395.82s]  This is ice.
[4395.82s -> 4407.22s]  That's hard.
[4407.22s -> 4420.26s]  What the hell?
[4420.26s -> 4439.90s]  That was too fast.
[4439.90s -> 4443.90s]  This is awful.
[4443.90s -> 4451.14s]  I can't do it.
[4451.14s -> 4457.02s]  I can't do it.
[4457.02s -> 4465.40s]  Did I win?
[4465.40s -> 4472.78s]  You're going to win.
[4472.78s -> 4482.82s]  Touching the flag doesn't do anything.
[4482.82s -> 4489.93s]  Can I hold onto the flag?
[4489.93s -> 4497.75s]  I didn't get to complete that.
[4497.75s -> 4501.75s]  I thought you said you were at the end.
[4501.75s -> 4518.90s]  You took it from me.
[4518.90s -> 4530.42s]  I've got to wait a long time.
[4530.42s -> 4534.42s]  Let's just stand and skip.
[4534.42s -> 4539.50s]  We need to skip.
[4539.50s -> 4544.50s]  This is the level where you wait in an elevator.
[4544.50s -> 4548.68s]  What am I supposed to do? Patience?
[4548.68s -> 4556.95s]  That's hard.
[4556.95s -> 4576.01s]  Can I stop?
[4576.01s -> 4581.02s]  This is Mario 64 shit.
[4581.02s -> 4590.02s]  You don't want to go that fast.
[4590.02s -> 4594.97s]  Look at this shit.
[4594.97s -> 4600.04s]  Look at this.
[4600.04s -> 4611.06s]  I'm throwing up.
[4611.06s -> 4631.80s]  Easy.
[4631.80s -> 4637.38s]  I feel like this is going to be worse than elevators.
[4637.38s -> 4648.90s]  I think you better set to go for it.
[4648.90s -> 4653.77s]  Wait a minute.
[4653.77s -> 4663.19s]  No.
[4663.19s -> 4674.90s]  Go for it.
[4674.90s -> 4680.66s]  That's so weird. I think you have to do it really slow.
[4680.66s -> 4686.87s]  Like a snail's crawl.
[4686.87s -> 4696.60s]  I can't do that turn slowly.
[4696.60s -> 4700.60s]  The force you need to do it right angle sends me flying.
[4700.60s -> 4704.97s]  Just walk.
[4704.97s -> 4711.11s]  I'm going to mean just walk.
[4711.11s -> 4716.62s]  Walk backwards.
[4716.62s -> 4741.19s]  Wait. Hold on. That was close.
[4741.19s -> 4745.19s]  Grip and just pull.
[4745.19s -> 4749.19s]  Grip and pull.
[4749.19s -> 4755.54s]  See how fucking you just start flying.
[4755.54s -> 4761.06s]  Hold grips and swing arms.
[4761.06s -> 4781.37s]  No.
[4781.37s -> 4798.18s]  Wait.
[4798.18s -> 4802.18s]  I'm practicing for a while.
[4802.18s -> 4806.87s]  It's grips.
[4806.87s -> 4812.84s]  Grip not triggers grips.
[4812.84s -> 4836.97s]  I don't want to mess up my strategy.
[4836.97s -> 4840.97s]  Cranking.
[4840.97s -> 4859.02s]  I'm just like the orangutan.
[4859.02s -> 4863.32s]  You're like the mom.
[4863.32s -> 4887.75s]  You're the mom orangutan and I'm like the baby.
[4887.75s -> 4895.50s]  Get off of me.
[4895.50s -> 4902.74s]  That thing makes you fall backwards.
[4902.74s -> 4910.89s]  Get us out.
[4910.89s -> 4930.41s]  Slow down.
[4930.41s -> 4934.84s]  I just hurt my back.
[4934.84s -> 4939.21s]  My back hurts.
[4939.21s -> 4946.78s]  Sit the next one up.
[4946.78s -> 4951.46s]  I think I was going to do the shake thing.
[4951.46s -> 4959.32s]  I hit the ceiling.
[4959.32s -> 4963.82s]  I have to go to a chiropractor and have him do the fucking
[4963.82s -> 4971.83s]  undertaker move where he breaks my back.
[4971.83s -> 4975.83s]  I want to go to a chiropractor that gives me a fucking tombstone.
[4975.83s -> 4980.52s]  Just bring me to a fucking cane.
[4980.52s -> 4985.46s]  Scoop me up and do the fucking tombstone piledriver to me.
[4985.46s -> 4989.64s]  Just end it.
[4989.64s -> 5009.08s]  Are we playing ping pong?
[5009.08s -> 5013.51s]  Bounce. Bounce you stupid game. Dumb.
[5013.51s -> 5019.42s]  This game is so dumb.
[5019.42s -> 5023.42s]  I'm actually really surprised that we're still playing this and I'm having fun.
[5023.42s -> 5028.49s]  I expected this game to be.
[5028.49s -> 5033.56s]  Somebody in chat last night said you should guys play climbing.
[5033.56s -> 5037.56s]  They said you'd probably get a couple of fun interesting orangutan on the mother jokes.
[5037.56s -> 5046.07s]  That sounds like a good idea.
[5046.07s -> 5056.55s]  I win. I win.
[5056.55s -> 5061.67s]  I win. Are you literally jumping?
[5061.67s -> 5086.10s]  Stop. Don't go yet.
[5086.10s -> 5090.86s]  Are you sure you want me to end this?
[5090.86s -> 5095.54s]  Dermot was just joking. He could beat that level any time he wants.
[5095.54s -> 5107.91s]  That was the one. High five.
[5107.91s -> 5111.91s]  I just actually put that in my fucking mouth.
[5111.91s -> 5116.54s]  Tongue in mouth.
[5116.54s -> 5121.67s]  You're not going to get me are you?
[5121.67s -> 5128.60s]  Get me up to the summit. I'm just like the parrot that you bring with you that Grant's wishes.
[5128.60s -> 5139.98s]  The parrot.
[5139.98s -> 5147.99s]  I love the parrot that Grant's wishes.
[5147.99s -> 5152.87s]  Excuse me. Not that fast.
[5152.87s -> 5159.03s]  Get on my back. Why did you push me sir?
[5159.03s -> 5163.03s]  I was putting a check point down and you pushed me. You can't push.
[5163.03s -> 5167.03s]  You pushed me. You did. I promise.
[5167.03s -> 5171.03s]  I bet you 500 cents.
[5171.03s -> 5175.96s]  Call my lawyer. You didn't have a lawyer. I know this because I've sued you before.
[5175.96s -> 5179.96s]  And won easily. You showed up there. You showed up in a fucking tank top
[5179.96s -> 5183.96s]  in pants suits.
[5183.96s -> 5187.96s]  In a fucking chicken costume.
[5187.96s -> 5192.52s]  Underneath?
[5192.52s -> 5196.52s]  Yeah. Underneath.
[5196.52s -> 5205.80s]  I was in a suit under that chicken costume.
[5205.80s -> 5212.54s]  Mom, I don't want to do this part.
[5212.54s -> 5219.90s]  I feel like that's you on every level.
[5219.90s -> 5232.12s]  What?
[5232.12s -> 5236.12s]  I don't want to get thrown off while I make a check point. That would be sweet.
[5236.12s -> 5246.36s]  Thank you.
[5246.36s -> 5251.30s]  You know what I'm really concerned about with VR?
[5251.30s -> 5255.30s]  I win.
[5255.30s -> 5259.30s]  When you have a VR helmet on
[5259.30s -> 5263.54s]  I hear that cheering.
[5263.54s -> 5269.58s]  And it's infuriating me.
[5269.58s -> 5273.58s]  When you have a VR headset on
[5273.58s -> 5277.58s]  You know how the glass is really really close to your eyes, right?
[5277.58s -> 5281.58s]  It's literally right here.
[5281.58s -> 5285.58s]  Not that it fogs up. I'm talking about
[5285.58s -> 5289.58s]  I kind of have this weird concern that you know how you accidentally
[5289.58s -> 5293.58s]  smash your face into a wall and you bump your controller into your face?
[5293.58s -> 5297.82s]  What's the testing? Have they done extensive safety testing where if
[5297.82s -> 5301.82s]  I punch my face accidentally and the glass shatters it's not going to shoot into my eyes?
[5301.82s -> 5305.82s]  No.
[5305.82s -> 5309.82s]  What if it just explodes the glass straight into your eyes?
[5309.82s -> 5314.06s]  Have they done tests of that yet?
[5314.06s -> 5320.34s]  Or are we the test subjects because VR is not really caught on yet?
[5320.34s -> 5325.40s]  You're so smart. Okay, next level.
[5325.40s -> 5333.53s]  We win.
[5333.53s -> 5338.15s]  This is like a safety glass.
[5338.15s -> 5344.86s]  Is there a level that we didn't do?
[5344.86s -> 5352.94s]  We did skyscraper?
[5352.94s -> 5356.94s]  We did it, we beat it.
[5356.94s -> 5361.82s]  There's like an open workshop button.
[5361.82s -> 5365.82s]  Let's take a little chat poll here.
[5365.82s -> 5369.99s]  What do you guys think?
[5369.99s -> 5373.99s]  Star does really well while I pretend to grab onto him as a baby monkey?
[5373.99s -> 5379.38s]  No matter what game we play that's going to happen.
[5379.38s -> 5384.84s]  Is my cam's frame rate wrong here?
[5384.84s -> 5400.07s]  Why is my camera's frame rate fucking off?
[5400.07s -> 5405.21s]  That's weird.
[5405.21s -> 5412.71s]  I think everyone wants us to move on.
[5412.71s -> 5418.41s]  Pavlov, we also have
[5418.41s -> 5424.82s]  The Lost Colony.
[5424.82s -> 5432.18s]  We should probably end on Pavlov because we'll probably be in that for a little while.
[5432.18s -> 5436.18s]  We had chef game that turned out to hack your computer.
[5436.18s -> 5440.87s]  You want to take a quick little piss break?
[5440.87s -> 5446.44s]  I'm a gamer, so I'm ready.
[5446.44s -> 5451.58s]  You can take a break.
[5451.58s -> 5458.04s]  I'm afraid it's going to break and shatter into my eyes.
[5458.04s -> 5463.10s]  Let's do Pulsar.
[5463.10s -> 5467.10s]  I have the lowest expectations for Pulsar.
[5467.10s -> 5472.55s]  But I'm coming in with an open mind.
[5472.55s -> 5476.55s]  I just get the vibe it's going to be NPC talking to people, reading boards.
[5476.55s -> 5480.55s]  I don't know why.
[5480.55s -> 5484.55s]  I can't read, you know that about me.
[5484.55s -> 5489.11s]  Did somebody just say you literally cannot play this game without five people?
[5489.11s -> 5493.11s]  It is driving a ship, so I also worried.
[5493.11s -> 5498.25s]  You physically can't play this without five people.
[5498.25s -> 5507.08s]  Pavlov does kind of need it. Can't we do all of it?
[5507.08s -> 5512.15s]  Just do three stream snipers.
[5512.15s -> 5516.95s]  Let's just do Pavy.
[5516.95s -> 5522.41s]  You don't even want to give that a try?
[5522.41s -> 5529.96s]  Not really.
[5529.96s -> 5533.96s]  Whatever you want to do.
[5533.96s -> 5537.96s]  Since we played VR last week, I've been waiting to do this again.
[5537.96s -> 5543.35s]  I'm really excited.
[5543.35s -> 5547.35s]  You've got a hot mic right now.
[5547.35s -> 5553.45s]  Don't talk about your credit card.
[5553.45s -> 5744.92s]  Hey, what's up? Hot mic.
[5744.92s -> 5755.46s]  Don't say credit card.
[5755.46s -> 5761.21s]  Don't say the word credit card.
[5761.21s -> 5766.58s]  Wait, was I on hot mic before?
[5766.58s -> 5771.27s]  Are you sure?
[5771.27s -> 5775.27s]  I know you were streaming.
[5775.27s -> 5779.90s]  I'm streaming, yes.
[5779.90s -> 5785.14s]  Probably shouldn't have done that.
[5785.14s -> 5792.49s]  I'll just cancel it.
[5792.49s -> 5796.73s]  You'd rather cancel your credit card than cancel payments?
[5796.73s -> 5800.73s]  You know how you said we were definitely not done playing EDF
[5800.73s -> 5805.10s]  and then you never played it again?
[5805.10s -> 5809.10s]  I still have the PlayStation subscription, but my PlayStation is completely unplugged.
[5809.10s -> 5813.83s]  The only way to cancel it is to plug it all back in.
[5813.83s -> 5817.83s]  Then I still wouldn't get to play EDF.
[5817.83s -> 5823.61s]  Pavlov!
[5823.61s -> 5827.61s]  Which one are we doing? Pavlov or Pulsar?
[5827.61s -> 5831.78s]  They both start with P and have Ls in them.
[5831.78s -> 5835.78s]  Honestly, I think it's going to take 30 minutes
[5835.78s -> 5839.78s]  to set up a VR game, tradition has shown, and then we're going to play Pavlov for 10.
[5839.78s -> 5845.24s]  I mean not Pavlov, Pulsar.
[5845.24s -> 5849.24s]  I'm opening Pavlov right now.
[5849.24s -> 5856.66s]  He just doesn't want to play Pulsar.
[5856.66s -> 5862.81s]  Can we get a handful of screenshots
[5862.81s -> 5866.81s]  of every time I have the helmet off in VR?
[5866.81s -> 5871.05s]  I want them compared in a collage.
[5871.05s -> 5878.28s]  Whoever has the technology to screenshot a screen,
[5878.28s -> 5882.84s]  just use it wisely.
[5882.84s -> 5888.41s]  Alright, I'm closing this. Calami was fun.
[5888.41s -> 5895.32s]  It was worth playing. 10 bucks. Pretty cheap.
[5895.32s -> 5906.52s]  It's still there.
[5906.52s -> 5912.79s]  People can hear you, right?
[5912.79s -> 5917.34s]  I feel like we'll be in Pavlov for a little while.
[5917.34s -> 5923.37s]  I'm launching it as we speak.
[5923.37s -> 5927.37s]  Not yet.
[5927.37s -> 5935.62s]  Ow, my knees!
[5935.62s -> 5942.79s]  I'm excited!
[5942.79s -> 5946.79s]  I just heard a gnome.
[5946.79s -> 5951.99s]  Did you guys hear that?
[5951.99s -> 5965.30s]  I'm not insane.
[5965.30s -> 5970.38s]  That's a bad place to put this.
[5970.38s -> 5977.35s]  Are you good?
[5977.35s -> 5983.00s]  My stream is showing the SteamVR menu,
[5983.00s -> 5988.78s]  but I'm in the game.
[5988.78s -> 6003.64s]  What do you want me to do?
[6003.64s -> 6008.46s]  I'm trying again. What do you want me to do?
[6008.46s -> 6012.46s]  Let me just get in my headset.
[6012.46s -> 6016.46s]  I'm trying to get air.
[6016.46s -> 6022.86s]  There's no oxygen in this mask.
[6022.86s -> 6027.98s]  I don't know if I can do this.
[6027.98s -> 6032.34s]  Pavlov is working for you?
[6032.34s -> 6037.72s]  I got it.
[6037.72s -> 6044.46s]  That's what I'm saying. My Oculus is showing inside Pavlov.
[6044.46s -> 6048.46s]  How did you launch it?
[6048.46s -> 6052.95s]  Launch it in SteamVR and launch it in OculusVR.
[6052.95s -> 6060.18s]  I launched it in SteamVR.
[6060.18s -> 6064.18s]  Let me try launching it from the Steam couch room.
[6064.18s -> 6068.18s]  Probably a good idea.
[6068.18s -> 6072.18s]  I'm getting one last sip.
[6072.18s -> 6087.59s]  It says you're playing it.
[6087.59s -> 6092.78s]  You don't understand the problem.
[6092.78s -> 6097.46s]  I don't think I can get this to work at all.
[6097.46s -> 6103.74s]  I have no idea what to do.
[6103.74s -> 6108.55s]  What if you open it in OculusVR?
[6108.55s -> 6113.69s]  The game launches yet.
[6113.69s -> 6117.93s]  My screen is showing something that is not happening.
[6117.93s -> 6124.26s]  Really?
[6124.26s -> 6130.15s]  It's like an infinite loading screen on my screen.
[6130.15s -> 6135.46s]  Do you want to try something else?
[6135.46s -> 6139.46s]  I'm going to try one thing and see if I can add it as an Oculus game and launch it from Oculus.
[6139.46s -> 6144.97s]  Hey everyone, buy an Oculus.
[6144.97s -> 6153.61s]  Keep hearing the note.
[6153.61s -> 6158.55s]  That's a joke where you're not supposed to buy an Oculus.
[6158.55s -> 6163.05s]  Press menu plus trigger to open the game menu.
[6163.05s -> 6171.96s]  That's me.
[6171.96s -> 6176.90s]  That's because it's this.
[6176.90s -> 6190.01s]  Grab right from using the grip.
[6190.01s -> 6194.25s]  Press the lower button to release the magazine.
[6194.25s -> 6200.02s]  Now it's a completely blank screen if I launch it from Oculus.
[6200.02s -> 6205.78s]  Grab your head and press rip.
[6205.78s -> 6211.56s]  Press menu to open the scoreboard.
[6211.56s -> 6219.06s]  I'm getting some resistance here.
[6219.06s -> 6226.49s]  That's better.
[6226.49s -> 6233.72s]  Don't jump out the window.
[6233.72s -> 6243.91s]  Press menu plus trigger to open the game menu.
[6243.91s -> 6250.33s]  Play offline, play online settings.
[6250.33s -> 6265.69s]  Every single game makes you do that, doesn't it?
[6265.69s -> 6278.39s]  It actually feels pretty good.
[6278.39s -> 6287.03s]  Where's the clip?
[6287.03s -> 6302.25s]  That's how you throw.
[6302.25s -> 6306.42s]  Grab, activate, and then let go.
[6306.42s -> 6314.23s]  The controls are actually really good.
[6314.23s -> 6322.95s]  Let me try this thing.
[6322.95s -> 6341.30s]  What's going on here?
[6341.30s -> 6345.30s]  Are you going to cock it?
[6345.30s -> 6349.30s]  My chat said your game is loud and also we might have to play in the beta branch.
[6349.30s -> 6354.82s]  We both have to be in the beta.
[6354.82s -> 6359.56s]  Do we have to download the game again?
[6359.56s -> 6364.95s]  If you just right click properties, switch to beta, it's a short download.
[6364.95s -> 6368.95s]  Can you confirm that that works first?
[6368.95s -> 6373.19s]  Then I can launch an Oculus VR mode so it should work.
[6373.19s -> 6415.82s]  Bunch of beta boys.
[6415.82s -> 6424.09s]  Did it work?
[6424.09s -> 6436.38s]  Is it confirmed?
[6436.38s -> 6442.46s]  The problem is solved.
[6442.46s -> 6464.20s]  How does this one work?
[6464.20s -> 6477.51s]  Are you good?
[6477.51s -> 6481.51s]  I'm in the game and it works.
[6481.51s -> 6491.56s]  That was a nightmare.
[6491.56s -> 6496.06s]  I think I'm going to throw my Oculus in the trash after the stream.
[6496.06s -> 6503.45s]  Why not on stream?
[6503.45s -> 6512.60s]  Let's close this.
[6512.60s -> 6518.70s]  Go get the beta client.
[6518.70s -> 6523.00s]  Do I have any betas?
[6523.00s -> 6529.40s]  I don't see any.
[6529.40s -> 6533.40s]  Beta dash.
[6533.40s -> 6537.96s]  I'm getting it.
[6537.96s -> 6550.12s]  Update queued.
[6550.12s -> 6554.12s]  Game will launch in approximately three hours.
[6554.12s -> 6560.20s]  No way.
[6560.20s -> 6571.78s]  Is there a reason why?
[6571.78s -> 6577.24s]  There it goes.
[6577.24s -> 6582.18s]  The beta client.
[6582.18s -> 6587.06s]  I totally am too tall because I can't reach the floor.
[6587.06s -> 6593.03s]  This shit is taking a long time.
[6593.03s -> 6599.45s]  Why is everything always about you?
[6599.45s -> 6604.90s]  You're almost at strike three.
[6604.90s -> 6608.90s]  We had technical problems when we started and now you have technical problems again?
[6608.90s -> 6613.66s]  That's strike two.
[6613.66s -> 6617.83s]  Strike three means you know what it means, right?
[6617.83s -> 6629.72s]  That's what it means.
[6629.72s -> 6633.72s]  Give a tour of your VR house.
[6633.72s -> 6637.72s]  This is what it looks like outside.
[6637.72s -> 6641.72s]  You hold your hand up.
[6641.72s -> 6646.02s]  A butterfly will land on you.
[6646.02s -> 6650.02s]  An Oculus.
[6650.02s -> 6656.36s]  Mark Zuckerberg.
[6656.36s -> 6660.60s]  I hit my mic.
[6660.60s -> 6675.64s]  Where are the butterflies?
[6675.64s -> 6685.03s]  What am I at?
[6685.03s -> 6689.03s]  25%.
[6689.03s -> 6693.03s]  I have gamer neck.
[6693.03s -> 6698.23s]  Just open my screen and take a screenshot.
[6698.23s -> 6707.13s]  It just puts extra weight down here.
[6707.13s -> 6714.82s]  Just go. I wanted to go but I have to download this beta client.
[6714.82s -> 6718.82s]  It was downloading so slow.
[6718.82s -> 6723.13s]  Blaine Star.
[6723.13s -> 6727.13s]  We were ready to go.
[6727.13s -> 6732.33s]  I was like alright fine.
[6732.33s -> 6736.33s]  What do we do?
[6736.33s -> 6750.46s]  I hurt my hand.
[6750.46s -> 6761.21s]  I just hurt myself.
[6761.21s -> 6766.41s]  For this you have to go on cam and do the Fortnite dance.
[6766.41s -> 6777.29s]  What's the one that goes like this?
[6777.29s -> 6781.29s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[6781.29s -> 6785.72s]  I'm just burning conversation fire right now.
[6785.72s -> 6804.41s]  What if I can't open the beta?
[6804.41s -> 6810.95s]  It's almost done.
[6810.95s -> 6829.50s]  You can't climb a tree.
[6829.50s -> 6834.63s]  Hold on a second.
[6834.63s -> 6838.63s]  Is there any reason why OpenVR wouldn't be capturing this?
[6838.63s -> 6847.46s]  I feel like every time I talk to you you're not there.
[6847.46s -> 6852.34s]  Is there any reason OpenVR wouldn't be capturing this?
[6852.34s -> 6860.28s]  I can't think of a reason.
[6860.28s -> 6873.59s]  OpenVR pulls whatever is in your headset.
[6873.59s -> 6877.59s]  Strike 3.
[6877.59s -> 6885.08s]  Now you can open the game but you can't capture it.
[6885.08s -> 6897.69s]  It's because I'm on an Oculus
[6897.69s -> 6901.69s]  and OpenVR is for Steam games.
[6901.69s -> 6906.30s]  Which is why if you have an Oculus
[6906.30s -> 6912.33s]  it should go in the trash.
[6912.33s -> 6916.33s]  It's quite the expensive technology.
[6916.33s -> 6922.17s]  All I have is desktop capture.
[6922.17s -> 6926.17s]  Is there a way I can change the field of view of my desktop capture
[6926.17s -> 6957.42s]  so it's not 6?
[6957.42s -> 6961.59s]  I'm about to launch the game.
[6961.59s -> 6971.98s]  This has been a pretty good break.
[6971.98s -> 6975.98s]  Enjoy the chat.
[6975.98s -> 6980.47s]  Just hanging out.
[6980.47s -> 6987.53s]  Enjoying my beverage.
[6987.53s -> 6994.62s]  Why did that person tell me to fuck off?
[6994.62s -> 7001.72s]  I'm opening the beta somehow.
[7001.72s -> 7006.02s]  I'm going to chill
[7006.02s -> 7011.46s]  playing with grenades.
[7011.46s -> 7017.99s]  I'm going to try a few things.
[7017.99s -> 7023.58s]  Is it opening?
[7023.58s -> 7038.34s]  I guess I'm in.
[7038.34s -> 7046.04s]  This looks ready to go.
[7046.04s -> 7053.35s]  I think I did it.
[7053.35s -> 7058.74s]  Did you figure it out?
[7058.74s -> 7062.74s]  I'm heading back in.
[7062.74s -> 7068.65s]  That was so loud I almost thought it was going to drive into my house.
[7068.65s -> 7072.82s]  This person is brazen.
[7072.82s -> 7078.09s]  They're starting to get even more ridiculous with this.
[7078.09s -> 7085.78s]  One of these days that car is coming through the wall.
[7085.78s -> 7093.98s]  I can't wait for that guy to be in the next Jerma Rumble.
[7093.98s -> 7104.54s]  Fucking vroom vroom is what that guy's name is going to be.
[7104.54s -> 7112.79s]  Why does this do this to me?
[7112.79s -> 7126.74s]  Easy. God.
[7126.74s -> 7134.87s]  Thank you for your patience.
[7134.87s -> 7142.30s]  Your patience is appreciated.
[7142.30s -> 7153.18s]  Therefore, you know the rest.
[7153.18s -> 7174.98s]  What does this do?
[7174.98s -> 7181.77s]  Pistols.
[7181.77s -> 7185.77s]  This is cool.
[7185.77s -> 7191.26s]  It's a little magnum.
[7191.26s -> 7198.36s]  Where did this come from?
[7198.36s -> 7213.59s]  Did I buy a pistol? How do I send this back?
[7213.59s -> 7217.59s]  Ten hours later, I apologize. This is all my fault.
[7217.59s -> 7221.59s]  I'm an embarrassment to you and your family. Thanks for having me over for Thanksgiving.
[7221.59s -> 7225.59s]  I invite you to my wedding and all that. I know now why you didn't come.
[7225.59s -> 7230.33s]  I'm ready to play.
[7230.33s -> 7234.33s]  It's giving me a random question.
[7234.33s -> 7238.33s]  I'm ready to play.
[7238.33s -> 7246.92s]  How do I get out of this? How do we play together?
[7246.92s -> 7258.38s]  There's a menu.
[7258.38s -> 7263.58s]  Play online?
[7263.58s -> 7267.88s]  I don't know.
[7267.88s -> 7272.31s]  North America, Europe.
[7272.31s -> 7277.38s]  Make a game or something.
[7277.38s -> 7281.38s]  If you hold down the menu button and then hold trigger,
[7281.38s -> 7285.56s]  you're going to get a menu. You're going to do play online.
[7285.56s -> 7289.56s]  I think these are just games that are going on right now.
[7289.56s -> 7293.56s]  This is just like a multiplayer shooter.
[7293.56s -> 7297.56s]  I'm going to make one.
[7297.56s -> 7301.56s]  Anybody watching right now that wants to play?
[7301.56s -> 7305.56s]  Don't stream tonight.
[7305.56s -> 7309.56s]  You have a headset on.
[7309.56s -> 7313.93s]  That's the future.
[7313.93s -> 7322.89s]  Why is that a bad idea?
[7322.89s -> 7327.51s]  We'll do it right now.
[7327.51s -> 7332.70s]  Check it out.
[7332.70s -> 7336.94s]  Input.
[7336.94s -> 7341.50s]  Hold on.
[7341.50s -> 7348.94s]  Sound.
[7348.94s -> 7354.25s]  What is that? Sound.
[7354.25s -> 7358.98s]  Is there no sound?
[7358.98s -> 7366.10s]  There is no sound option.
[7366.10s -> 7373.99s]  There is no audio setting.
[7373.99s -> 7379.45s]  We're going to get stream sniped.
[7379.45s -> 7383.45s]  There's friendly fire. You can turn bots on.
[7383.45s -> 7387.45s]  I see your lobby right there.
[7387.45s -> 7391.45s]  Whisper me the password.
[7391.45s -> 7395.45s]  This is friends only.
[7395.45s -> 7400.65s]  What's your phone number?
[7400.65s -> 7406.28s]  It was 741.
[7406.28s -> 7410.28s]  Can I mute me?
[7410.28s -> 7414.28s]  How do I mute you?
[7414.28s -> 7419.66s]  You can mute people.
[7419.66s -> 7424.34s]  That's not a problem.
[7424.34s -> 7428.34s]  It's this biz kid.
[7428.34s -> 7434.82s]  Quick.
[7434.82s -> 7440.41s]  There was a kick button here a second ago.
[7440.41s -> 7444.41s]  Get him out of here.
[7444.41s -> 7449.74s]  I don't care.
[7449.74s -> 7456.02s]  We're going to get five copy pastas for the people that come in here.
[7456.02s -> 7461.54s]  There's a mute mic button on the left.
[7461.54s -> 7465.54s]  When somebody comes in, just hit mute mic on them.
[7465.54s -> 7471.90s]  I swear I saw a kick thing.
[7471.90s -> 7476.26s]  How many people are watching your stream right now?
[7476.26s -> 7480.57s]  6,000.
[7480.57s -> 7484.57s]  5,000 here. How many do you have there?
[7484.57s -> 7488.57s]  There's like 6,000 people watching this together.
[7488.57s -> 7500.92s]  Only Tanner from high school has this game?
[7500.92s -> 7505.67s]  Collectively we have 6,000 people.
[7505.67s -> 7511.26s]  I'm Tanner.
[7511.26s -> 7515.26s]  I'm not. I'm shooting the bots.
[7515.26s -> 7520.07s]  Why am I dead?
[7520.07s -> 7528.07s]  They just walk over.
[7528.07s -> 7541.05s]  How do you reload a gun?
[7541.05s -> 7545.22s]  Do I have any more?
[7545.22s -> 7549.22s]  I need more bullets.
[7549.22s -> 7553.22s]  You have bullets in your sack on your left.
[7553.22s -> 7563.90s]  Look in your sack.
[7563.90s -> 7573.43s]  I can't bend that low.
[7573.43s -> 7578.87s]  Do you have infinite ammo?
[7578.87s -> 7583.94s]  I don't know.
[7583.94s -> 7593.05s]  Are we playing the gun game?
[7593.05s -> 7599.96s]  I'm just playing. Stop with the questions.
[7599.96s -> 7608.66s]  I'm here with bot Kurt.
[7608.66s -> 7621.45s]  They're letting me do this.
[7621.45s -> 7627.61s]  They shouldn't be letting us do this.
[7627.61s -> 7635.03s]  Why are you shooting people in the head?
[7635.03s -> 7641.90s]  Why?
[7641.90s -> 7645.90s]  You're that big. I knew it.
[7645.90s -> 7649.90s]  I knew you were the huge guy.
[7649.90s -> 7659.26s]  I should have known.
[7659.26s -> 7666.12s]  You're bigger than Earthquake.
[7666.12s -> 7671.51s]  He's out of ammo.
[7671.51s -> 7680.97s]  What?
[7680.97s -> 7686.94s]  The different trigger for grabbing the front of your gun is really screwing me up.
[7686.94s -> 7693.53s]  This is nauseating.
[7693.53s -> 7705.24s]  Wait a minute. What the fuck? Are you kidding me?
[7705.24s -> 7711.21s]  This actually is just VR counter strike, isn't it?
[7711.21s -> 7720.30s]  You just bend over and pick up guns because I totally can't.
[7720.30s -> 7729.58s]  I don't know.
[7729.58s -> 7733.58s]  We can play with the actual people.
[7733.58s -> 7743.93s]  Anyone joining?
[7743.93s -> 7765.06s]  Damn it.
[7765.06s -> 7779.14s]  What was this?
[7779.14s -> 7788.63s]  Now I didn't get him.
[7788.63s -> 7793.70s]  Why did I just hear you?
[7793.70s -> 7798.70s]  You're gonna die.
[7798.70s -> 7812.86s]  That's the bot Dave.
[7812.86s -> 7819.06s]  Is that what it is?
[7819.06s -> 7828.22s]  They're footsteps everywhere.
[7828.22s -> 7832.58s]  Why can't I hear him?
[7832.58s -> 7837.19s]  No.
[7837.19s -> 7841.19s]  The bot Dave spawns behind people?
[7841.19s -> 7851.18s]  As long as you don't break TOS, we're fine.
[7851.18s -> 7861.74s]  You're a reasonable person.
[7861.74s -> 7867.45s]  I feel like I've seen you one time.
[7867.45s -> 7875.88s]  I just thought you were reasonable. Let's not push in here.
[7875.88s -> 7887.59s]  This feels good.
[7887.59s -> 7891.59s]  Fucking bot Dave!
[7891.59s -> 7909.37s]  Throw it right over his head.
[7909.37s -> 7915.91s]  This is not what I thought it was.
[7915.91s -> 7922.95s]  What do you have?
[7922.95s -> 7932.04s]  This is cool.
[7932.04s -> 7941.34s]  I want to keep this.
[7941.34s -> 7955.46s]  No!
[7955.46s -> 7965.53s]  This is alright.
[7965.53s -> 7969.53s]  He's bottom bragging.
[7969.53s -> 7973.53s]  Let's do a gun game.
[7973.53s -> 7980.44s]  Experience all the guns on data center.
[7980.44s -> 7984.44s]  Turn off friends only they say.
[7984.44s -> 7990.09s]  I assume they can join even if we're playing.
[7990.09s -> 7996.10s]  Unless this is 2003.
[7996.10s -> 8002.71s]  Why is everybody doing Bunker S?
[8002.71s -> 8006.71s]  What's the nuclear option?
[8006.71s -> 8018.02s]  I actually have no idea.
[8018.02s -> 8022.52s]  Can you open the menu the way you did before?
[8022.52s -> 8026.52s]  No talking anyone.
[8026.52s -> 8034.31s]  Do you have any idea?
[8034.31s -> 8047.94s]  We're inviting a vampire into our house apparently.
[8047.94s -> 8056.47s]  Go to menu.
[8056.47s -> 8063.08s]  Save by spring.
[8063.08s -> 8067.08s]  Save our spring.
[8067.08s -> 8071.08s]  You already did that.
[8071.08s -> 8094.12s]  He's behind me.
[8094.12s -> 8108.94s]  Drop it.
[8108.94s -> 8113.75s]  I can't even see your game anymore.
[8113.75s -> 8120.36s]  Why are they always behind you Jerma?
[8120.36s -> 8124.36s]  I press the lead button.
[8124.36s -> 8129.16s]  I don't want to know what that is.
[8129.16s -> 8133.40s]  Is your game still named Star?
[8133.40s -> 8138.46s]  I see data center.
[8138.46s -> 8144.10s]  Can I see who's in this game?
[8144.10s -> 8150.25s]  It's probably full.
[8150.25s -> 8154.25s]  I accidentally did it.
[8154.25s -> 8158.25s]  I thought it was back.
[8158.25s -> 8163.06s]  Don't do that.
[8163.06s -> 8167.62s]  You do have to do that because now you have to make a new game.
[8167.62s -> 8171.62s]  I'm in the lobby right now because I did the thing that you almost did.
[8171.62s -> 8176.44s]  Kick somebody and invite.
[8176.44s -> 8181.83s]  Just kick somebody.
[8181.83s -> 8185.83s]  That doesn't feel good. It feels better when the streamer is an idiot and has to make the new game.
[8185.83s -> 8190.07s]  Play online. Creating lobby.
[8190.07s -> 8194.07s]  Friend only so you can join.
[8194.07s -> 8199.46s]  I'm setting a pin so it's only stream friend.
[8199.46s -> 8203.64s]  I'm in your game.
[8203.64s -> 8208.58s]  I don't see you.
[8208.58s -> 8212.82s]  Your name is not Star?
[8212.82s -> 8219.05s]  This is definitely the lobby.
[8219.05s -> 8226.10s]  That was a wrong game.
[8226.10s -> 8233.00s]  What's password?
[8233.00s -> 8237.00s]  Friend only.
[8237.00s -> 8241.00s]  Don't open the menu and click leave.
[8241.00s -> 8245.00s]  It's actually leave game.
[8245.00s -> 8253.64s]  How do you arrest somebody?
[8253.64s -> 8260.18s]  Final gun and gun game is handcuffs.
[8260.18s -> 8268.97s]  There we go.
[8268.97s -> 8273.72s]  I'm ready to win.
[8273.72s -> 8281.67s]  I'm fucking ready.
[8281.67s -> 8286.17s]  This is loaded?
[8286.17s -> 8298.63s]  You're like gun gaming.
[8298.63s -> 8303.26s]  It's like back and it's leave.
[8303.26s -> 8311.34s]  I didn't mute it.
[8311.34s -> 8319.08s]  Is this a countdown preparing us?
[8319.08s -> 8325.29s]  I don't see a countdown.
[8325.29s -> 8329.66s]  I muted Josh.
[8329.66s -> 8336.31s]  This is fucking awesome.
[8336.31s -> 8343.16s]  What is this like?
[8343.16s -> 8349.32s]  I'm muted every time.
[8349.32s -> 8355.42s]  Everybody is muted and I'm still hearing people talk.
[8355.42s -> 8380.49s]  That's the kill feed.
[8380.49s -> 8384.49s]  Oh fuck.
[8384.49s -> 8389.69s]  I should always be turning around.
[8389.69s -> 8406.23s]  I can still take this.
[8406.23s -> 8414.94s]  That guy's fucking hat off.
[8414.94s -> 8436.30s]  I got it too.
[8436.30s -> 8440.30s]  I hate the controls in this.
[8440.30s -> 8444.73s]  It's just different to grab than the other gun games we've played.
[8444.73s -> 8448.90s]  You don't keep trying to grab the full of your gun and pulling out your magazine.
[8448.90s -> 8452.90s]  You have to do it on some guns.
[8452.90s -> 8457.40s]  You don't understand.
[8457.40s -> 8464.25s]  Oh shit.
[8464.25s -> 8468.25s]  You don't like this? I think this is a blast.
[8468.25s -> 8473.58s]  This is awesome. It's hard to get used to
[8473.58s -> 8479.35s]  being the opposite of how it is.
[8479.35s -> 8483.35s]  Nice spawning behind me.
[8483.35s -> 8487.35s]  Nice. Nice job.
[8487.35s -> 8503.37s]  I got no scoped.
[8503.37s -> 8516.74s]  Really?
[8516.74s -> 8526.58s]  Nice. Good shot.
[8526.58s -> 8534.65s]  I hate these snipers. This is so awesome.
[8534.65s -> 8543.29s]  I just got turned on.
[8543.29s -> 8547.29s]  Oh my god. Are you kidding? That didn't kill him.
[8547.29s -> 8551.29s]  What the hell did you just do?
[8551.29s -> 8557.00s]  I'm trying to pull the little handle out.
[8557.00s -> 8561.48s]  There we go. It does it automatically.
[8561.48s -> 8565.91s]  No it doesn't.
[8565.91s -> 8580.04s]  On what?
[8580.04s -> 8594.42s]  Oh my god. I hate you.
[8594.42s -> 8613.69s]  Fuck you Tommy.
[8613.69s -> 8621.26s]  Fuck you Mike.
[8621.26s -> 8632.34s]  I hope you guys saw that. That was fucking cool.
[8632.34s -> 8639.58s]  I don't know how this gun works.
[8639.58s -> 8647.70s]  Shit where? Over here?
[8647.70s -> 8652.07s]  Reaction time.
[8652.07s -> 8656.07s]  Somebody put the handcuffs on?
[8656.07s -> 8660.50s]  Did you use bolt with two hands?
[8660.50s -> 8665.51s]  Let's do it again.
[8665.51s -> 8669.51s]  I'm bolting with the wrong hand.
[8669.51s -> 8673.82s]  I was doing it too.
[8673.82s -> 8688.68s]  Learn to use the iron sight.
[8688.68s -> 8697.18s]  Forget that.
[8697.18s -> 8703.02s]  What? What?
[8703.02s -> 8707.51s]  We're people in this game?
[8707.51s -> 8721.53s]  I don't believe you.
[8721.53s -> 8736.12s]  We're all around looking for people.
[8736.12s -> 8755.64s]  I did not.
[8755.64s -> 8764.68s]  Get your right in the head.
[8764.68s -> 8774.01s]  That was a waste.
[8774.01s -> 8779.85s]  I expected to not find anyone for 15 minutes again.
[8779.85s -> 8796.02s]  That's what I have to say to that.
[8796.02s -> 8808.78s]  He's holding it upside down.
[8808.78s -> 8821.27s]  Geez Louise this is a bad one.
[8821.27s -> 8828.57s]  Turn around.
[8828.57s -> 8833.43s]  I'm walking in circles.
[8833.43s -> 8837.43s]  Anyone knows if there's moving and accuracy?
[8837.43s -> 8844.58s]  That's a good question.
[8844.58s -> 8849.72s]  Come on.
[8849.72s -> 8866.55s]  I've been stuck on this saying two guns.
[8866.55s -> 8871.56s]  Wrong button.
[8871.56s -> 8875.56s]  Don't grab the mag with that gun.
[8875.56s -> 8891.75s]  I have to turn like that.
[8891.75s -> 8898.02s]  360.
[8898.02s -> 8911.66s]  What was that?
[8911.66s -> 8918.89s]  What?
[8918.89s -> 8922.89s]  I'm confused.
[8922.89s -> 8926.89s]  Why did I not see you?
[8926.89s -> 8931.83s]  That's my mic.
[8931.83s -> 8957.29s]  I'm trying so hard.
[8957.29s -> 8963.83s]  I didn't get that kill.
[8963.83s -> 8973.37s]  Damn.
[8973.37s -> 8989.50s]  I didn't grab it.
[8989.50s -> 8998.65s]  I'm so confused on that.
[8998.65s -> 9002.65s]  How do I have zero kills?
[9002.65s -> 9011.42s]  This is fucking hard.
[9011.42s -> 9021.64s]  Again.
[9021.64s -> 9025.64s]  I have to solve the mystery of taking your hand off the trigger.
[9025.64s -> 9029.64s]  After you take your hand off the trigger once
[9029.64s -> 9033.82s]  then you have to hold forever.
[9033.82s -> 9063.62s]  I'm going mad.
[9063.62s -> 9067.62s]  My headphone fell out.
[9067.62s -> 9071.62s]  Can I glue this into my brain?
[9071.62s -> 9084.30s]  My ears are getting too sweaty.
[9084.30s -> 9100.36s]  I wish I could see how much health they had left.
[9100.36s -> 9107.46s]  I got him.
[9107.46s -> 9114.57s]  Shoot me please.
[9114.57s -> 9120.63s]  What the fuck?
[9120.63s -> 9124.63s]  What the fuck?
[9124.63s -> 9143.00s]  Oh my god.
[9143.00s -> 9157.34s]  I'm having problems here.
[9157.34s -> 9177.67s]  You spawned right...
[9177.67s -> 9195.88s]  I got you.
[9195.88s -> 9203.56s]  Where did you know
[9203.56s -> 9207.56s]  that I was there from?
[9207.56s -> 9230.92s]  It's the free upgrade.
[9230.92s -> 9236.49s]  Oh fuck no.
[9236.49s -> 9255.58s]  Poor spy crap.
[9255.58s -> 9274.44s]  Understand how I didn't die.
[9274.44s -> 9282.12s]  Did a lot of
[9282.12s -> 9287.51s]  little bits of damage apparently.
[9287.51s -> 9294.70s]  Come here.
[9294.70s -> 9298.70s]  Yes.
[9298.70s -> 9307.21s]  Good job.
[9307.21s -> 9314.89s]  What happened there?
[9314.89s -> 9324.79s]  I'm trying to use the iron sight.
[9324.79s -> 9333.58s]  I wonder what that looks like to people watching.
[9333.58s -> 9356.09s]  Use the front?
[9356.09s -> 9360.09s]  I am using the front and rear sights.
[9360.09s -> 9364.09s]  The way that OpenVR works is it only captures
[9364.09s -> 9368.09s]  one eye. So depending on where I'm holding it probably doesn't look like
[9368.09s -> 9377.94s]  I'm doing it but I am.
[9377.94s -> 9381.94s]  Search and destroy?
[9381.94s -> 9385.94s]  What is this one?
[9385.94s -> 9396.25s]  My arms are covered in water.
[9396.25s -> 9401.58s]  Unless your other eye is on your chin.
[9401.58s -> 9411.18s]  It's hard.
[9411.18s -> 9415.18s]  It's a thing you never did before.
[9415.18s -> 9429.90s]  It's a really
[9429.90s -> 9436.23s]  not loaded map.
[9436.23s -> 9440.23s]  He's played this game before.
[9440.23s -> 9449.91s]  No.
[9449.91s -> 9468.54s]  I don't know about this one.
[9468.54s -> 9473.34s]  What is that?
[9473.34s -> 9490.86s]  Up top.
[9490.86s -> 9498.42s]  Excellent work.
[9498.42s -> 9520.98s]  Did I get him?
[9520.98s -> 9528.09s]  Did I get him?
[9528.09s -> 9534.68s]  What happened?
[9534.68s -> 9543.05s]  I don't know how it works.
[9543.05s -> 9559.22s]  Please sitting down.
[9559.22s -> 9563.66s]  Good.
[9563.66s -> 9575.38s]  Make sure nobody hits me.
[9575.38s -> 9581.54s]  It's so hard to do that.
[9581.54s -> 9594.36s]  I'm going to sneak up and just shotgun blast.
[9594.36s -> 9605.74s]  How do I go faster?
[9605.74s -> 9614.95s]  I thought I was going to shoot anybody with this thing.
[9614.95s -> 9627.56s]  I have no idea how you're supposed to hold a sniper
[9627.56s -> 9631.56s]  straight when it has no weight.
[9631.56s -> 9635.56s]  Looking through the scope.
[9635.56s -> 9640.25s]  There's no way.
[9640.25s -> 9644.25s]  Don't people have VR gun things?
[9644.25s -> 9648.55s]  I think you can get one.
[9648.55s -> 9652.92s]  I got a sniper rifle again.
[9700.26s -> 9705.78s]  Now I can shoot it.
[9705.78s -> 9717.18s]  I didn't hit him in the head.
[9717.18s -> 9732.33s]  What?
[9732.33s -> 9742.26s]  Put it down.
[9742.26s -> 9769.27s]  It's an HTC Vive gun.
[9769.27s -> 9773.27s]  That's so cool.
[9773.27s -> 9802.46s]  He's just waving at me.
[9802.46s -> 9807.83s]  This is like a demon.
[9807.83s -> 9811.83s]  It looks very uncomfortable.
[9811.83s -> 9817.64s]  I'm sitting down.
[9817.64s -> 9828.09s]  I got him.
[9828.09s -> 9834.49s]  The intensity is here.
[9834.49s -> 9838.49s]  I got this sniper rifle again.
[9838.49s -> 9862.25s]  Hey, just want to show you where I am.
[9862.25s -> 9882.87s]  That was horrible.
[9882.87s -> 9886.87s]  I fucking murdered you.
[9886.87s -> 9890.87s]  Jesus Christ, you need to buy guns?
[9890.87s -> 9904.57s]  That was fun though.
[9904.57s -> 9909.38s]  No one's spotting behind me.
[9909.38s -> 9913.75s]  Buy a gun.
[9913.75s -> 9917.99s]  How do you buy a gun?
[9917.99s -> 9923.00s]  Get ready.
[9923.00s -> 9927.00s]  Left controller on the trackpad.
[9927.00s -> 9936.02s]  You can buy stuff.
[9936.02s -> 9941.53s]  Trackpad?
[9941.53s -> 9945.70s]  Are we bad guys or good guys?
[9945.70s -> 9963.82s]  We're the good guys no matter what.
[9963.82s -> 9969.08s]  I'm ready with my little baby gun.
[9969.08s -> 9973.08s]  Is that a bad guy? Who's on my team?
[9973.08s -> 9977.64s]  I took one second to see where I was.
[9977.64s -> 9996.63s]  Is there a bomb in here?
[9996.63s -> 10007.64s]  I'm dead.
[10007.64s -> 10014.57s]  Where is this bomb?
[10020.07s -> 10024.82s]  Have I played Counter-Strike before?
[10024.82s -> 10028.82s]  Maybe three or four times in my life.
[10028.82s -> 10035.29s]  We are defusing bombs.
[10035.29s -> 10043.35s]  Let's go.
[10043.35s -> 10054.81s]  Put your hands down and move faster.
[10054.81s -> 10086.71s]  I'm here.
[10086.71s -> 10090.71s]  Just say behind.
[10090.71s -> 10094.71s]  Like a chef.
[10094.71s -> 10098.71s]  Not behind you.
[10098.71s -> 10104.17s]  You have a roast duck behind you.
[10104.17s -> 10108.17s]  I don't lie.
[10108.17s -> 10118.98s]  We scared them.
[10123.61s -> 10128.42s]  Are we supposed to be planting the bomb?
[10128.42s -> 10132.42s]  No.
[10132.42s -> 10150.02s]  Can I sell this?
[10150.02s -> 10177.46s]  I just need to make sure it works.
[10177.46s -> 10181.46s]  Covering fire.
[10181.46s -> 10186.90s]  Did I?
[10186.90s -> 10193.77s]  I threw his gun out.
[10193.77s -> 10197.77s]  I like this gun.
[10197.77s -> 10203.35s]  What's this?
[10203.35s -> 10230.46s]  Devolitions.
[10230.46s -> 10236.98s]  Stop.
[10236.98s -> 10251.75s]  I don't know.
[10251.75s -> 10256.76s]  Put it here.
[10256.76s -> 10271.54s]  There's a spot on the wall.
[10271.54s -> 10278.46s]  I don't have one of those.
[10278.46s -> 10287.48s]  You got this. Easy.
[10287.48s -> 10291.98s]  They're the ones planting the bomb.
[10291.98s -> 10295.98s]  I had bombs.
[10295.98s -> 10300.34s]  Grenades.
[10300.34s -> 10306.70s]  How do you throw the grenade?
[10306.70s -> 10310.70s]  If I did that over here, I'm going through the wall.
[10310.70s -> 10314.70s]  When you throw in this game, you throw really fast.
[10314.70s -> 10318.70s]  Do you have to hold grip and let go?
[10318.70s -> 10324.41s]  Or trigger and let go?
[10324.41s -> 10328.41s]  Let go.
[10328.41s -> 10338.44s]  Who wants this gun?
[10338.44s -> 10345.74s]  It makes me hold it easier.
[10345.74s -> 10353.99s]  It's like monsters.
[10353.99s -> 10359.90s]  I think I got an extra.
[10359.90s -> 10370.50s]  It's my time.
[10370.50s -> 10378.71s]  Let the rookie in.
[10378.71s -> 10382.71s]  Look at that line.
[10382.71s -> 10393.78s]  I'm going to make sure they don't come down that way.
[10393.78s -> 10398.98s]  This is really awesome.
[10398.98s -> 10419.43s]  Do I have to pump it?
[10419.43s -> 10444.26s]  I can't see.
[10444.26s -> 10454.30s]  That's it.
[10454.30s -> 10468.70s]  Time for the big gun to come out.
[10468.70s -> 10501.32s]  Where's the other one?
[10501.32s -> 10506.52s]  Can I haunt him?
[10506.52s -> 10518.23s]  This guy is always behind me.
[10518.23s -> 10529.88s]  Let's see how things are going.
[10529.88s -> 10533.88s]  Where are you?
[10533.88s -> 10541.32s]  I'm stream sniping. He's planting a bomb.
[10541.32s -> 10547.29s]  Get a good view.
[10547.29s -> 10559.72s]  I don't believe it. It's impossible.
[10559.72s -> 10571.45s]  That was like the term VR is in your name.
[10571.45s -> 10582.28s]  Is this going to blow up?
[10582.28s -> 10594.92s]  Is everyone sneezing?
[10594.92s -> 10598.92s]  I'm going to stay with everybody.
[10598.92s -> 10603.54s]  I'm getting spam weapons.
[10603.54s -> 10607.54s]  This is the ultimate spam weapon.
[10607.54s -> 10611.54s]  I'm going to hold the buttons down.
[10611.54s -> 10620.38s]  I'm so sorry.
[10620.38s -> 10624.87s]  I'm so sorry.
[10624.87s -> 10634.15s]  I'm really sorry.
[10634.15s -> 10638.15s]  Watch out.
[10638.15s -> 10650.62s]  I think I killed him.
[10650.62s -> 10654.62s]  This is really cool.
[10654.62s -> 10658.62s]  I'm trying to figure out how to jerk off the gun.
[10658.62s -> 10662.62s]  Did that button not do it?
[10662.62s -> 10666.62s]  I don't know what to do.
[10666.62s -> 10671.30s]  Two shotguns?
[10671.30s -> 10676.49s]  Knife only.
[10676.49s -> 10682.07s]  Let's tell them knife only and then let me shoot them with the shotgun.
[10682.07s -> 10693.40s]  Where are they?
[10693.40s -> 10698.92s]  On the right.
[10698.92s -> 10706.66s]  Covering fire there.
[10706.66s -> 10712.81s]  What is this? It was like a drone here.
[10712.81s -> 10717.37s]  I fucking hate this game.
[10717.37s -> 10754.82s]  Hold the gun and pull it out.
[10754.82s -> 10761.08s]  Is this like 60 rounds?
[10761.08s -> 10765.51s]  I don't need money.
[10765.51s -> 10769.51s]  I can't buy anything.
[10769.51s -> 10789.43s]  I can afford the pirate gun for rushing B.
[10789.43s -> 10821.37s]  Let's fucking go.
[10821.37s -> 10826.50s]  Teams.
[10826.50s -> 10833.53s]  I don't know what to pick.
[10833.53s -> 10837.70s]  I'm not sure.
[10837.70s -> 10867.06s]  I'm going to be Reaper.
[10867.06s -> 10872.57s]  I panicked.
[10872.57s -> 10884.87s]  I don't know what to do in these scenarios.
[10884.87s -> 10889.18s]  I'm going to server.
[10889.18s -> 10905.18s]  There's too much.
[10905.18s -> 10912.86s]  Headphones are gone.
[10912.86s -> 10916.86s]  That's not how a shotgun is held.
[10916.86s -> 10921.93s]  That's not how a shotgun is held.
[10921.93s -> 10928.01s]  Jesus Christ.
[10928.01s -> 10932.18s]  Are we going to the climbing game?
[10932.18s -> 10939.82s]  What am I supposed to do with this?
[10939.82s -> 10943.82s]  What am I supposed to do with this?
[10943.82s -> 10952.84s]  What am I supposed to do with this?
[10952.84s -> 10962.25s]  This is too expensive.
[10962.25s -> 10968.66s]  I'm not supposed to own this.
[10968.66s -> 10972.66s]  This was like a $75 gun that my mother bought me.
[10972.66s -> 10994.87s]  Buy armor.
[10994.87s -> 10999.18s]  I aimed for the head.
[10999.18s -> 11005.14s]  It was a very heavy statue gun.
[11005.14s -> 11015.18s]  Where is this?
[11015.18s -> 11019.67s]  That's bad.
[11019.67s -> 11023.67s]  That was a 1 in 10 game.
[11023.67s -> 11027.67s]  You almost had it.
[11027.67s -> 11032.94s]  Are there other people that want to go in it?
[11032.94s -> 11039.48s]  Are there people that want to play?
[11039.48s -> 11044.17s]  What?
[11044.17s -> 11055.19s]  That's a good joke.
[11055.19s -> 11059.75s]  What are you doing?
[11059.75s -> 11063.75s]  You're waiting for me?
[11063.75s -> 11067.75s]  What did you just do for a game mode?
[11067.75s -> 11071.75s]  TDM?
[11071.75s -> 11078.17s]  Walking around corners is the hardest thing.
[11109.00s -> 11117.62s]  I'm trying to get the sidearm.
[11117.62s -> 11127.46s]  Give me the shotgun.
[11127.46s -> 11132.84s]  I'm ready for 5 guns.
[11132.84s -> 11137.96s]  I'm too slow.
[11137.96s -> 11144.57s]  What did I do?
[11144.57s -> 11151.78s]  What?
[11151.78s -> 11169.40s]  You bastard.
[11169.40s -> 11186.36s]  I'm so sorry.
[11186.36s -> 11190.36s]  I saw a person teleport in front of me.
[11190.36s -> 11208.47s]  There's a guy behind you.
[11208.47s -> 11235.80s]  I got him.
[11235.80s -> 11241.69s]  Get over there.
[11241.69s -> 11252.38s]  What's happening?
[11252.38s -> 11264.33s]  That's not good.
[11264.33s -> 11268.76s]  I'm so sorry everybody.
[11268.76s -> 11272.76s]  That had to be the worst offense ever.
[11272.76s -> 11276.76s]  I was reloading the gun.
[11276.76s -> 11286.74s]  It wasn't that bad?
[11286.74s -> 11295.38s]  What did you just give me?
[11295.38s -> 11300.31s]  I've run a full lap.
[11300.31s -> 11304.31s]  The inside of my ear is straight water.
[11304.31s -> 11318.79s]  There's no way these are staying in for more than 5 seconds at a time.
[11318.79s -> 11323.35s]  I don't want this little thing.
[11323.35s -> 11327.35s]  Oh god.
[11327.35s -> 11349.00s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[11349.00s -> 11362.23s]  Bread and butter.
[11362.23s -> 11368.39s]  That's what I'm talking about with my bread and butter.
[11368.39s -> 11372.87s]  My lighthouse.
[11372.87s -> 11384.26s]  I broke it.
[11384.26s -> 11395.21s]  I'm just running a marathon.
[11395.21s -> 11400.02s]  Where's the button to press to make this work?
[11400.02s -> 11414.89s]  What happened?
[11414.89s -> 11418.89s]  There was someone the whole time.
[11418.89s -> 11426.70s]  Wait.
[11426.70s -> 11432.79s]  I don't understand.
[11432.79s -> 11438.76s]  There's a guy on the ceiling.
[11438.76s -> 11447.35s]  It was a grenade.
[11447.35s -> 11454.41s]  I think I might have to go to the bathroom.
[11454.41s -> 11463.61s]  What?
[11463.61s -> 11467.61s]  I swear.
[11467.61s -> 11473.38s]  This is one of those games where my thumb is really hurting.
[11473.38s -> 11479.21s]  This game is wild.
[11479.21s -> 11484.54s]  Run!
[11484.54s -> 11488.54s]  Save us!
[11488.54s -> 11503.00s]  I'm losing my mind.
[11503.00s -> 11507.00s]  My tail is wrapping around me.
[11507.00s -> 11522.90s]  Oh my god.
[11522.90s -> 11526.90s]  The drink?
[11526.90s -> 11533.90s]  You scared the shit out of me.
[11533.90s -> 11543.70s]  I thought I dumped it on the ground.
[11543.70s -> 11551.66s]  That would be horrible.
[11551.66s -> 11556.60s]  This is ridiculous.
[11556.60s -> 11560.60s]  I'll do one more and then we can move on.
[11560.60s -> 11566.70s]  Gun game was fun.
[11566.70s -> 11576.87s]  I think I gave up trying to get this thing.
[11576.87s -> 11582.76s]  Now I've got to wipe my disgusting headset.
[11582.76s -> 11613.45s]  I'm almost back.
[11613.45s -> 11618.52s]  Don't shoot me.
[11618.52s -> 11622.52s]  I feel like I can hear footsteps on the other side of the map.
[11622.52s -> 11643.77s]  Shit! Nice shot.
[11643.77s -> 11648.39s]  What do they say?
[11648.39s -> 11658.12s]  They say game up.
[11658.12s -> 11662.12s]  Twitch energy drink mode?
[11662.12s -> 11714.54s]  What the hell does that mean?
[11714.54s -> 11724.28s]  Game on.
[11724.28s -> 11728.52s]  The gun doesn't even make a noise.
[11728.52s -> 11734.02s]  Don't say that.
[11734.02s -> 11758.36s]  You just spoiled the whole show.
[11758.36s -> 11770.44s]  Like your avatar.
[11770.44s -> 11774.81s]  Sometimes it pumps in my cheek.
[11774.81s -> 11780.01s]  How can I have somebody be in front of me?
[11780.01s -> 11803.06s]  Nobody around.
[11803.06s -> 11827.62s]  Wow!
[11827.62s -> 11831.62s]  Watch out there.
[11831.62s -> 11870.52s]  Did I do it?
[11870.52s -> 11881.74s]  Behind you guys.
[11881.74s -> 11888.41s]  This isn't fair.
[11888.41s -> 11893.35s]  I was supposed to win.
[11893.35s -> 11900.02s]  Why are we watching Jeremy be bad at games?
[11900.02s -> 11906.68s]  Do you understand how hard this is to do?
[11906.68s -> 11911.43s]  No.
[11911.43s -> 11917.02s]  It's harder when you're short.
[11917.02s -> 11922.58s]  Game on.
[11922.58s -> 11927.51s]  You just did it.
[11927.51s -> 11943.45s]  You're never going to see him again.
[11943.45s -> 11957.22s]  Wait for people to come from exactly right there.
[11957.22s -> 11994.20s]  Don't worry, I'm behind you guys.
[11994.20s -> 12002.06s]  He's behind me.
[12002.06s -> 12008.26s]  Stop! I'm concentrating.
[12008.26s -> 12025.99s]  He's behind you.
[12025.99s -> 12037.06s]  He's behind us.
[12037.06s -> 12042.52s]  No, I will not.
[12042.52s -> 12046.52s]  Was I behind you?
[12046.52s -> 12060.73s]  He was behind me.
[12060.73s -> 12083.83s]  We both can't hit each other.
[12083.83s -> 12090.76s]  What the hell are you doing?
[12090.76s -> 12141.46s]  My hand is breaking.
[12141.46s -> 12150.74s]  Did it change guns?
[12150.74s -> 12161.37s]  I was standing in my dead zone.
[12161.37s -> 12166.81s]  No tracking there.
[12166.81s -> 12187.35s]  Why is it quiet?
[12187.35s -> 12250.46s]  Jeremy's bad at games.
[12250.46s -> 12256.60s]  What?
[12256.60s -> 12267.61s]  This is fun as hell.
[12267.61s -> 12271.61s]  What a fun game.
[12271.61s -> 12278.22s]  Let's do it again.
[12278.22s -> 12282.97s]  I love this.
[12282.97s -> 12286.97s]  I think there's more maps on the workshop.
[12286.97s -> 12292.42s]  I think I can download them right through here.
[12292.42s -> 12299.27s]  You should be able to.
[12299.27s -> 12303.83s]  They all have 2 star ratings.
[12303.83s -> 12307.83s]  I'm not a kid, I'm 14.
[12307.83s -> 12326.86s]  You can't emancipate till 16.
[12326.86s -> 12348.55s]  That guy is in some kind of shape.
[12348.55s -> 12354.63s]  I think someone is behind me.
[12354.63s -> 12361.18s]  You have to believe.
[12361.18s -> 12365.18s]  You have to believe.
[12365.18s -> 12373.42s]  I thought he was upstairs.
[12373.42s -> 12405.67s]  No one can be behind me.
[12405.67s -> 12432.79s]  Don't say that.
[12432.79s -> 12442.26s]  They told you they weren't.
[12442.26s -> 12483.00s]  It's so hard.
[12483.00s -> 12488.89s]  It's so hard.
[12488.89s -> 12494.20s]  Let me take a look through my scope.
[12494.20s -> 12511.86s]  Why is that my kill?
[12511.86s -> 12522.10s]  Did you shoot the gun out of my hand?
[12522.10s -> 12543.90s]  What weapon?
[12543.90s -> 12563.94s]  Dime sized scope.
[12563.94s -> 12604.44s]  Too many people in every direction.
[12604.44s -> 12625.11s]  There's a monster on the ceiling.
[12625.11s -> 12646.94s]  That's game 2.
[12646.94s -> 12650.94s]  I'm getting better, but I'm not better than Guy with VR in his name.
[12650.94s -> 12654.94s]  I got sweat all over me.
[12654.94s -> 12659.69s]  I'm shaking.
[12659.69s -> 12664.06s]  Game 20.
[12664.06s -> 12668.87s]  Just one more.
[12668.87s -> 12677.26s]  Just one more game.
[12677.26s -> 12681.82s]  That's it.
[12681.82s -> 12685.82s]  After this one game where I don't get on the scoreboard.
[12685.82s -> 12699.75s]  This is the one.
[12699.75s -> 12713.82s]  I lit that pool up.
[12713.82s -> 12732.06s]  You stole that from me.
[12732.06s -> 12736.23s]  Where am I?
[12736.23s -> 12758.57s]  Somebody is behind me.
[12758.57s -> 12778.41s]  In both directions.
[12778.41s -> 12791.26s]  Did I get you?
[12791.26s -> 12799.45s]  I'm not listening to chat ever again.
[12799.45s -> 12803.82s]  I will never listen to you ever again.
[12803.82s -> 12808.76s]  Dump soda on the ground.
[12808.76s -> 12812.76s]  Unbelievable.
[12812.76s -> 12826.01s]  It's the first thing I see when I come out.
[12826.01s -> 12832.42s]  Who threw the gun?
[12832.42s -> 12844.09s]  My hitbox is bigger than everyone's.
[12844.09s -> 12855.30s]  Maybe you shouldn't have the giant setting.
[12855.30s -> 12859.30s]  There's one other tall guy in here.
[12859.30s -> 12916.07s]  Where is this coming from?
[12916.07s -> 12946.73s]  Excuse me.
[12946.73s -> 12956.06s]  I have no idea how to reload this.
[12956.06s -> 12960.23s]  I got like an achievement for killing him.
[12960.23s -> 12964.66s]  Why was there a dude that was massive?
[12964.66s -> 12969.35s]  He was like the size of a skyscraper.
[12969.35s -> 12974.68s]  I have no idea.
[12974.68s -> 12979.50s]  I don't even know who was tall.
[12979.50s -> 12984.55s]  Maybe he is just that tall.
[12984.55s -> 12988.55s]  He might be like 9 or 10 feet tall.
[12988.55s -> 12996.12s]  He's standing on a chair.
[12996.12s -> 13000.12s]  The last one.
[13000.12s -> 13022.52s]  Can you smell me?
[13022.52s -> 13031.16s]  Why would you ever want the fun thing?
[13031.16s -> 13074.74s]  I'm so close.
[13074.74s -> 13084.86s]  There's a wall here.
[13084.86s -> 13118.36s]  Where are you at?
[13118.36s -> 13128.49s]  The data.
[13128.49s -> 13134.52s]  I'm getting disoriented.
[13134.52s -> 13161.64s]  Thank god.
[13161.64s -> 13178.36s]  I just spawned there.
[13178.36s -> 13200.34s]  I'm going up.
[13200.34s -> 13207.82s]  I don't know where the hell you are.
[13207.82s -> 13214.68s]  I don't know where the hell you are.
[13214.68s -> 13222.36s]  What?
[13222.36s -> 13226.36s]  This is not a one shot kill?
[13226.36s -> 13230.54s]  This thing's not a one shot kill gun.
[13230.54s -> 13239.83s]  Right hand bolt.
[13239.83s -> 13243.83s]  I'm sorry.
[13243.83s -> 13259.96s]  I don't know why this gun spawns in my hand.
[13259.96s -> 13263.96s]  I should be used to it.
[13263.96s -> 13278.62s]  I'll take it.
[13278.62s -> 13299.35s]  Not bad.
[13299.35s -> 13310.74s]  I heard him.
[13310.74s -> 13324.70s]  I don't know how to reload.
[13324.70s -> 13336.79s]  That's what I want.
[13336.79s -> 13343.13s]  How come the guy with his hands won't run to me?
[13343.13s -> 13348.50s]  Thanks for playing guys.
[13348.50s -> 13353.06s]  That was a blast.
[13353.06s -> 13359.32s]  That was fun.
[13359.32s -> 13363.32s]  How long has it been?
[13363.32s -> 13368.76s]  I have no idea.
[13368.76s -> 13377.91s]  Sorry everybody.
[13377.91s -> 13382.86s]  3 hours and 45.
[13382.86s -> 13387.40s]  Unless there's something else you want to do.
[13387.40s -> 13391.88s]  I have a couple other things I could play.
[13391.88s -> 13396.50s]  There are a few things I could play.
[13396.50s -> 13400.74s]  It's up to you.
[13400.74s -> 13406.20s]  Let's see.
[13406.20s -> 13417.58s]  There's always Pulsar.
[13417.58s -> 13423.29s]  He's not going to budge.
[13423.29s -> 13427.85s]  You're going to remake it for me.
[13427.85s -> 13431.85s]  You need to remake it for me.
[13431.85s -> 13435.85s]  Beat Saber multiplayer.
[13435.85s -> 13441.18s]  That would be me getting my ass kicked.
[13441.18s -> 13445.18s]  I have a handful of things I could do.
[13445.18s -> 13449.18s]  That was Star by the way.
[13449.18s -> 13453.18s]  That's not true.
[13453.18s -> 13457.18s]  Twitch.tv.
[13457.18s -> 13461.86s]  That makes so much sense.
[13461.86s -> 13465.86s]  I should be able to walk.
[13465.86s -> 13470.62s]  That's great.
[13470.62s -> 13476.89s]  That was fun playing with you.
[13476.89s -> 13481.26s]  Enjoy Beat Saber.
[13481.26s -> 13485.93s]  We have D-Rail Valley.
[13485.93s -> 13496.62s]  Minecraft.
[13496.62s -> 13503.42s]  That's going to have to be another day.
[13503.42s -> 13507.42s]  Pavlov.
[13507.42s -> 13516.84s]  That was probably the best shooter for VR.
[13516.84s -> 13521.66s]  Let's try Disassembly.
[13521.66s -> 13529.42s]  You could make cars and tear them apart.
[13529.42s -> 13536.71s]  It looked interesting.
[13536.71s -> 13540.71s]  Did Gorn get an update yet?
[13540.71s -> 13545.02s]  I don't think it has.
[13545.02s -> 13549.02s]  Last time I tried to play Gorn with the same settings,
[13549.02s -> 13556.18s]  there was a performance update.
[13556.18s -> 13564.20s]  I don't think they updated it yet.
[13564.20s -> 13580.01s]  Are you sure?
[13580.01s -> 13589.56s]  I'm just going to open it and see what happens.
[13589.56s -> 13596.09s]  The beta build reportedly fixed it.
[13596.09s -> 13606.01s]  How does this look?
[13606.01s -> 13625.58s]  Before it was like 20 frames a second.
[13625.58s -> 13633.75s]  Are you okay?
[13633.75s -> 13639.98s]  That looks a lot better.
[13639.98s -> 13653.42s]  I should have dragged it that fast.
[13653.42s -> 13658.42s]  What the fuck is wrong with me?
[13658.42s -> 13667.83s]  The vroom guy has to go home.
[13667.83s -> 13672.14s]  This is what he does for work.
[13672.14s -> 13677.91s]  He gets paid $50 an hour to drive fast.
[13677.91s -> 13685.46s]  What do you do for work?
[13685.46s -> 13689.83s]  It's funny you say that.
[13689.83s -> 13694.07s]  I just drive around in a circle.
[13694.07s -> 13698.76s]  It's hard to explain.
[13698.76s -> 13702.94s]  Twitch streamers try to explain their income.
[13702.94s -> 13706.94s]  I'm like a guy that has a platform called car.
[13706.94s -> 13710.94s]  I drive around in a circle.
[13710.94s -> 13714.94s]  I step on the gas on this one specific strip
[13714.94s -> 13718.94s]  of 800 to 900 yards
[13718.94s -> 13722.94s]  for 12 times a day.
[13722.94s -> 13729.70s]  Who pays you?
[13729.70s -> 13736.42s]  I do. I've had a lot of money in bitcoin.
[13736.42s -> 13744.82s]  This is my dream.
[13744.82s -> 13749.88s]  That was fun.
[13749.88s -> 13753.88s]  More multiplayer.
[13753.88s -> 13757.88s]  Star couldn't figure out how to get his shit going.
[13757.88s -> 13762.95s]  What was that?
[13762.95s -> 13768.65s]  Looks like it's fixed.
[13768.65s -> 13775.18s]  I'm sure we'll find out real quickly here.
[13775.18s -> 13779.18s]  If there's a mod that has the capability
[13779.18s -> 13783.18s]  to change the name of the game to Gorn.
[13783.18s -> 13788.36s]  Grab world. Move hand here.
[13788.36s -> 13795.83s]  Move back.
[13795.83s -> 13799.83s]  Press and hold to grab world.
[13799.83s -> 13803.83s]  I have different controls set up.
[13803.83s -> 13808.26s]  What the fuck was that?
[13808.26s -> 13824.71s]  That was very odd.
[13824.71s -> 13829.77s]  It's fixed.
[13829.77s -> 13833.77s]  Yes! This is the game everybody wanted me to play so badly.
[13833.77s -> 13837.77s]  Now I get to actually play it.
[13837.77s -> 13858.47s]  This is the one.
[13858.47s -> 13864.62s]  Let's kick that guy's ass.
[13864.62s -> 13873.34s]  One of these emote faces. This game is absurdly violent.
[13873.34s -> 13879.05s]  If you're not over the age of 21, don't consume alcoholic beverages.
[13879.05s -> 13885.02s]  This is fixed. Let's fucking go.
[13885.02s -> 13889.02s]  Toggle hold. Hold. Gesture.
[13889.02s -> 13893.83s]  Is that the only gesture? Just middle finger.
[13893.83s -> 13899.58s]  Real mature. Right off the bat.
[13899.58s -> 13903.58s]  I don't know what this is today.
[13903.58s -> 13909.40s]  I've done it like five times today.
[13909.40s -> 13917.34s]  Let's go. Gesture. Hold. Toggle hold.
[13917.34s -> 13921.34s]  Let's go.
[13921.34s -> 13931.58s]  Streamer tells audience to fuck off.
[13931.58s -> 13939.38s]  When did I do that?
[13939.38s -> 13943.38s]  Toggle hold.
[13943.38s -> 13947.38s]  Okay.
[13947.38s -> 13952.70s]  So is there a quick turn?
[13952.70s -> 13956.70s]  Or do I actually have to turn?
[13956.70s -> 13966.10s]  Alright. Let's go.
[13966.10s -> 13970.34s]  Is there a block or a parry?
[13970.34s -> 13981.59s]  Is this what you want?
[13981.59s -> 13990.68s]  Is this what you want to see?
[13990.68s -> 14002.63s]  Come here.
[14002.63s -> 14006.87s]  Ooh. I broke his ankle.
[14006.87s -> 14011.05s]  How's the audio?
[14011.05s -> 14015.86s]  Label?
[14015.86s -> 14020.49s]  Good.
[14020.49s -> 14025.18s]  Okay.
[14025.18s -> 14030.76s]  How do I grab this?
[14030.76s -> 14037.18s]  There we go. This is like a rubber mace.
[14037.18s -> 14051.37s]  Alright. Bring it on. Next wave. Still alive?
[14051.37s -> 14060.97s]  You gotta go. You gotta break their arms.
[14060.97s -> 14070.84s]  Holy shit. I just blew up that guy's head. Watch out.
[14070.84s -> 14083.80s]  Oh my god. That's terrible.
[14083.80s -> 14088.23s]  You got shin pads? I see. I see. I get you.
[14088.23s -> 14111.19s]  Come on. On the ground. Right in the chest.
[14111.19s -> 14115.69s]  I fucking won!
[14115.69s -> 14120.87s]  This is actually really fun.
[14120.87s -> 14124.87s]  Do I just have to keep going?
[14124.87s -> 14129.69s]  Shield this time. Okay. I want this in my right hand.
[14129.69s -> 14138.95s]  Excuse me.
[14138.95s -> 14148.49s]  Okay. Easy.
[14148.49s -> 14161.74s]  This is a huge shield. It's like an umbrella.
[14161.74s -> 14172.66s]  Can I hit myself in the face?
[14172.66s -> 14188.09s]  Oops-a-daisy. Easy here. Right in the legs.
[14188.09s -> 14198.06s]  Come on! Oh, is this your friend?
[14198.06s -> 14203.26s]  How come these guys don't have armor? They're just free kills.
[14203.26s -> 14210.74s]  Rip off someone's head?
[14210.74s -> 14214.74s]  Oh, okay. So there's a champion at the end of this.
[14214.74s -> 14218.74s]  I gotta do this.
[14218.74s -> 14222.74s]  So, wait. Wait. Wait.
[14222.74s -> 14226.74s]  Free for all? I don't have a weapon.
[14226.74s -> 14230.98s]  Oh, fuck. Give me a weapon.
[14230.98s -> 14249.37s]  Give me that. Come here.
[14249.37s -> 14272.46s]  I think he's dead. I'm getting wrapped up in my cord. Uh-oh.
[14272.46s -> 14276.46s]  Careful there's a wall.
[14276.46s -> 14280.76s]  I'm actually getting stuck.
[14280.76s -> 14286.92s]  Stuck. Oh, god. I'm getting close to something.
[14286.92s -> 14298.46s]  I know it. I can feel it. How many more? Free for all?
[14298.46s -> 14307.42s]  Until what? Until everyone's dead? Oh, you can throw shit too.
[14307.42s -> 14311.96s]  Come here.
[14311.96s -> 14317.66s]  I just fucking Curly, Moe, and Larry.
[14317.66s -> 14321.96s]  Whatever their names are. It's free punks.
[14321.96s -> 14336.09s]  I did it! What's the final channel?
[14336.09s -> 14343.32s]  Okay.
[14347.32s -> 14351.32s]  Alright, let me get ready here. Let me get ready.
[14351.32s -> 14365.26s]  Bring it on. Alright, does it get like a gulp mask on?
[14365.26s -> 14373.32s]  I'll take that. You ain't gonna be fighting anymore.
[14373.32s -> 14380.23s]  Oh, it took his whole arm off.
[14380.23s -> 14384.23s]  That guy was easier than the default enemies.
[14384.23s -> 14393.45s]  I almost just hit the wall. It's okay.
[14393.45s -> 14399.53s]  Alright, Achilles. General? What's Achilles?
[14399.53s -> 14406.71s]  This is easy. Soda. The soda spilled. Oh, no.
[14406.71s -> 14413.90s]  You don't have a camera anymore. You opened the door and walked outside.
[14413.90s -> 14423.18s]  I can see the soda on the table, guys.
[14423.18s -> 14427.61s]  Should we go to tier two? How does this work?
[14427.61s -> 14434.52s]  I can only do tier one. I'm just gonna go to Achilles.
[14434.52s -> 14441.38s]  It is.
[14445.38s -> 14450.07s]  This is a proper sword. This isn't a real sword.
[14450.07s -> 14457.58s]  This is a fake sword. So we got slicing action.
[14457.58s -> 14461.58s]  I gotta cut a leg off. Oh, my God.
[14461.58s -> 14470.10s]  That was actually really cool.
[14470.10s -> 14483.30s]  Holy shit.
[14483.30s -> 14488.89s]  How do I rip somebody's head off?
[14488.89s -> 14506.30s]  Take a body of limbs and your head.
[14506.30s -> 14527.35s]  How do I rip his head off?
[14527.35s -> 14550.38s]  How do I do that?
[14550.38s -> 14554.38s]  Well, that was absolutely brutal.
[14554.38s -> 14559.19s]  Where's the new weapon? It's Battle Axe.
[14559.19s -> 14564.89s]  Yes. Jesus. Yeah, that was pretty insane.
[14564.89s -> 14569.45s]  Two hands? No. A little slower movement on this one, I think.
[14569.45s -> 14578.66s]  Yeah, a little bit.
[14578.66s -> 14591.72s]  Legs. Try to sweep underneath.
[14591.72s -> 14603.30s]  Are you still swinging at me?
[14603.30s -> 14607.30s]  How are you still doing this?
[14607.30s -> 14614.60s]  How are you still doing this? Oh, my God.
[14614.60s -> 14619.40s]  Whoa. I took his chin off.
[14619.40s -> 14625.82s]  Shit, he hit me.
[14625.82s -> 14632.79s]  Oh, there's bow and arrows in this game?
[14632.79s -> 14645.14s]  Come here.
[14645.14s -> 14650.28s]  Whatever. He's dead.
[14650.28s -> 14654.58s]  You fight that guy, eventually.
[14654.58s -> 14658.58s]  I'm going to get taught.
[14658.58s -> 14663.98s]  Okay.
[14663.98s -> 14667.98s]  Alright, so we got blunt.
[14667.98s -> 14671.98s]  We got our little hammer here.
[14671.98s -> 14680.12s]  Let's go for, I'm going to say shoulders.
[14680.12s -> 14694.39s]  Go club. This guy's got plate armor on.
[14694.39s -> 14731.75s]  That's new. What weapon? Something else I can use?
[14731.75s -> 14735.75s]  Oh, fuck. It's kind of hard for me to do two at the same time.
[14735.75s -> 14739.75s]  I'm dead. Yeah, do well with this control setup because
[14739.75s -> 14743.75s]  when you have two weapons, this no longer
[14743.75s -> 14747.75s]  is like walk. So, it's hard to do two.
[14747.75s -> 14756.14s]  This is like better for shield for me. Because then I have to use this to walk when I swing
[14756.14s -> 14777.90s]  with this hand. Come here.
[14777.90s -> 14796.97s]  Good night. What else you got? Grab the armor first.
[14796.97s -> 14807.54s]  Nope. Just kidding. Watch out, there's a wall somewhere here. I want that axe.
[14807.54s -> 14828.90s]  Hello? There we go.
[14828.90s -> 14837.10s]  Anymore?
[14837.10s -> 14841.10s]  This is a soda.
[14841.10s -> 14847.83s]  Okay, what do we got?
[14847.83s -> 14854.34s]  Okay. Hmm.
[14854.34s -> 14871.83s]  I wasn't a fan of this last time, but I'll try it again.
[14871.83s -> 14891.37s]  See what I mean? I can't walk forward. Because when I raise
[14891.37s -> 14895.37s]  my hand up, it's like, are you sure you're moving? It's not ideal.
[14895.37s -> 14901.30s]  See when I lift my hand up, even if I'm trying to
[14901.30s -> 14905.30s]  walk forward, I go backwards. So, I have to go backwards
[14905.30s -> 14930.34s]  when I lift my hand up here. It's weird.
[14930.34s -> 14951.83s]  Come here. I don't think so.
[14951.83s -> 14957.27s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Good thing I had the hand scraps on.
[14957.27s -> 14961.27s]  That was a broken glass. Something would have shattered.
[14961.27s -> 14983.90s]  Arrows. Goodbye. Yes!
[14983.90s -> 14991.02s]  Is there a multiplayer in this game?
[14991.02s -> 14996.15s]  I don't think there is.
[14996.15s -> 15000.15s]  Okay, here comes Achilles.
[15000.15s -> 15005.98s]  Where am I? Ooh.
[15005.98s -> 15009.98s]  Alright, I'm going to go with just one hand here.
[15009.98s -> 15025.67s]  I'm way better with one hand.
[15025.67s -> 15032.41s]  Let me see his leg. That's why your name is Achilles!
[15032.41s -> 15046.31s]  That would make sense, wouldn't it? I guess that's throwing shit.
[15046.31s -> 15055.14s]  Oh, what a clever boy. Achilles.
[15055.14s -> 15061.61s]  Preserker. General. Well, we can go into tier two.
[15061.61s -> 15073.00s]  What is general? Is general just
[15073.00s -> 15084.07s]  like the general? Badgermancer.
[15084.07s -> 15089.91s]  Everybody seems to want to see this one.
[15098.84s -> 15104.30s]  This control is...
[15104.30s -> 15108.86s]  Okay. I like spears in these games.
[15108.86s -> 15120.71s]  I'm going to have to move around with the right stick here.
[15120.71s -> 15130.76s]  Really slippery though. I guess I can just swing.
[15130.76s -> 15134.76s]  Nope. I need to go the other direction.
[15134.76s -> 15144.94s]  Come here. I need to, yeah, I gotta go the
[15144.94s -> 15159.19s]  other way. Alright, you can pick people up, I think.
[15159.19s -> 15167.90s]  Come here.
[15167.90s -> 15177.30s]  What is happening? Alright, let go of this.
[15177.30s -> 15185.43s]  I don't want to use this thing anymore. That's what I'm talking
[15185.43s -> 15197.16s]  about. That's much better. This thing is so tangled.
[15197.16s -> 15234.90s]  Jeremy, you're a sicko. Oops-a-daisy.
[15234.90s -> 15256.79s]  That thing looks kind of fun. Oh, I thought you went under.
[15256.79s -> 15288.79s]  I thought he went down. Oh, shit. Is he dead? Yeah.
[15288.79s -> 15307.00s]  I'm ripping his head off. Oh, fuck it.
[15307.00s -> 15311.94s]  Oops. What? Did I bump into my thing?
[15311.94s -> 15318.97s]  Open it up.
[15318.97s -> 15327.11s]  Ugh.
[15327.11s -> 15332.17s]  One, two, three. Oops-a-daisy. That didn't work.
[15332.17s -> 15337.93s]  That did not work like I intended it to.
[15337.93s -> 15347.35s]  Oh, the goddamn controller.
[15347.35s -> 15356.31s]  I'm going to die.
[15356.31s -> 15361.06s]  Oh, I'm exhausted.
[15361.06s -> 15365.62s]  I really wish it, okay, so this is the worst part.
[15365.62s -> 15369.62s]  Ready? I'm moving forward. Now I'm moving backward.
[15369.62s -> 15373.62s]  It doesn't matter. I'm holding here. Now we're going this way.
[15373.62s -> 15377.62s]  I wish it was just forward because now I have to go. I have to switch to back.
[15377.62s -> 15381.62s]  It's literally, it's just whatever direction the track pad is in.
[15381.62s -> 15389.51s]  I'd rather just have this be forward.
[15389.51s -> 15451.38s]  Will you stop? Bring him on. Yeah, crash.
[15451.38s -> 15489.70s]  Look at that dude. Oh, trying to do a cool move. Trying to throw him in the air.
[15489.70s -> 15499.56s]  Does that guy have a t-shirt on?
[15499.56s -> 15520.04s]  That guy just almost did the look at me. He's close.
[15520.04s -> 15527.91s]  One, two, three. Is this it? Last guy.
[15527.91s -> 15535.62s]  Come here.
[15535.62s -> 15540.06s]  This is fucking so much fun.
[15540.06s -> 15545.82s]  Spikes? Oh, shit. Those are spikes.
[15545.82s -> 15551.34s]  What are those? What is on me?
[15551.34s -> 15567.80s]  Spiderman grips? Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me, give me, give me.
[15567.80s -> 15581.82s]  Give me that back. They're like boomerangs? Okay.
[15581.82s -> 15593.40s]  That's really cool. Holy shit.
[15593.40s -> 15616.47s]  This is too much.
[15616.47s -> 15629.51s]  No. Those things are really fun. I'm running out of gas so I'm not going to lie.
[15629.51s -> 15634.84s]  I'm running out of gas. I didn't have very much left in the tank when I opened this.
[15634.84s -> 15643.61s]  That's a good technique. Just thunderclap.
[15643.61s -> 15663.64s]  I've got to throw somebody in the spikes at least once before I leave.
[15663.64s -> 15679.26s]  Thank you. Come here. Jesus. That worked.
[15701.26s -> 15712.58s]  God damn it.
[15712.58s -> 15716.76s]  Alright. I'm killing the badger guy and I'm done.
[15716.76s -> 15725.66s]  I've used all my fuel. This game is fucking awesome though.
[15725.66s -> 15742.23s]  That guy don't matter. We'll take care of this guy first.
[15742.23s -> 15751.70s]  His eyes just popped out of his head.
[15751.70s -> 15756.71s]  I've got this guy's like juice on me.
[15756.71s -> 15764.34s]  The people are stuck. Get this off.
[15764.34s -> 15782.58s]  How am I going to release?
[15782.58s -> 15793.10s]  He's still on me.
[15793.10s -> 15806.28s]  Alright.
[15806.28s -> 15810.28s]  Too many movement games today.
[15810.28s -> 15817.51s]  The climbing game. The run around shoot game.
[15817.51s -> 15821.82s]  It's been just exercising for four hours.
[15821.82s -> 15850.42s]  I'm running on a treadmill for four hours.
[15850.42s -> 15865.27s]  I want the bow. Let me try the bow. How does this work?
[15865.27s -> 15872.65s]  Wow. That's fun. Give me the arrow battery.
[15872.65s -> 15887.42s]  I'm going to use this.
[15887.42s -> 15897.77s]  That didn't go very far.
[15897.77s -> 15911.66s]  Not good. Give me something else.
[15911.66s -> 15917.48s]  I hate that control scheme. It's going to make me scream.
[15917.48s -> 15943.00s]  Can I change that?
[15947.75s -> 15953.06s]  Funny.
[15953.06s -> 15957.06s]  Are we going to get a comedy level?
[15957.06s -> 15973.75s]  A little stabber?
[15973.75s -> 15996.58s]  I'm doing it like real life.
[15996.58s -> 16013.50s]  Come here. You can pick him up and you can
[16013.50s -> 16023.78s]  skewer him. That's amazing.
[16023.78s -> 16040.30s]  See you later. That did so good.
[16040.30s -> 16050.81s]  What happened to your arm?
[16050.81s -> 16054.81s]  Your arm is not doing so well.
[16054.81s -> 16069.83s]  Goodbye.
[16069.83s -> 16079.37s]  Alright. Boss time after this, right?
[16079.37s -> 16086.54s]  You're dead?
[16086.54s -> 16100.26s]  What?
[16100.26s -> 16105.70s]  What? What happened there?
[16105.70s -> 16111.86s]  I don't understand. What was hitting me?
[16111.86s -> 16122.94s]  There was nobody else behind me. You have to kill somebody to live.
[16122.94s -> 16128.25s]  He hit me once and I feel like I shouldn't have died there.
[16128.25s -> 16138.01s]  Is it like a fast
[16138.01s -> 16142.70s]  kill for these things? This thing is fun but
[16142.70s -> 16148.46s]  I'd rather just use my weapon.
[16148.46s -> 16175.03s]  I like this thing way better.
[16175.03s -> 16190.97s]  That feels good.
[16190.97s -> 16199.80s]  Alright. Watch out for the wall.
[16199.80s -> 16217.53s]  I was trying to get a wall.
[16217.53s -> 16258.15s]  Why does it just have its mind of its own? That's it?
[16258.15s -> 16266.74s]  Delay. Drink him.
[16266.74s -> 16273.61s]  Badger Mancer.
[16273.61s -> 16286.47s]  Here it comes. Let's go.
[16286.47s -> 16311.16s]  Do I get a weapon? Do they come after me?
[16311.16s -> 16323.06s]  What do I do?
[16323.06s -> 16327.56s]  What's going on? What's happening?
[16327.56s -> 16333.78s]  Why is it still giving me a chance?
[16333.78s -> 16345.18s]  I'm going to go kick the shit out of him.
[16345.18s -> 16355.08s]  I'm going to get fucking hurt.
[16364.62s -> 16380.28s]  I did it!
[16380.28s -> 16384.28s]  I ran out of fuel 40 minutes ago.
[16384.28s -> 16397.85s]  You get special weapons after you beat the bosses. That's actually really fun.
[16397.85s -> 16403.22s]  You had grappling hooks the whole time that you didn't use.
[16403.22s -> 16413.06s]  Oh well. But that was a ton of fun.
[16413.06s -> 16417.06s]  VR is just too much fun. I wish I had more stamina.
[16417.06s -> 16428.12s]  End of the Badger Mancer voice.
[16428.12s -> 16435.56s]  Imagine the smell. I don't smell. I smell fine. That was a lot of fun.
[16435.56s -> 16441.88s]  Let me take this off.
[16441.88s -> 16446.89s]  I will see you guys on the next stream.
[16446.89s -> 16453.29s]  You can change the control screen. Yeah. I'll have to do that.
[16453.29s -> 16457.98s]  I'm not streaming tomorrow. I think the next time
[16457.98s -> 16465.74s]  you guys are going to see me is Wednesday.
[16465.74s -> 16474.70s]  Two days. Not next Wednesday.
[16474.70s -> 16481.37s]  Going is a lot of fun. I might have to come back and play it.
[16481.37s -> 16490.60s]  We're going to do a VR night where I complete the
[16490.60s -> 16498.92s]  games that I didn't beat. And Mind Show 2, I know.
[16498.92s -> 16502.92s]  There's so many experiences. The thing with Mind Show though is Mind Show should be a pretty
[16502.92s -> 16506.92s]  I don't think I'll play that for like three to four hours. I feel like I could
[16506.92s -> 16510.92s]  do that for a while because it's not a whole lot of like fucking jumping around like running and
[16510.92s -> 16518.55s]  breathing and up, down, up, down, twist, twist, twist.
[16518.55s -> 16523.30s]  But thank you everybody. I'll see you in a couple days. Like always.
[16523.30s -> 16529.58s]  These streams are a fucking ton of fun. Playing with Star was a lot of fun.
[16529.58s -> 16533.58s]  The last two days of co-op have been fucking hilarious.
[16533.58s -> 16538.07s]  And stressful. And fun. So it's been great.
[16538.07s -> 16542.38s]  Thank you everybody. I will see you all real soon. Take care of yourselves.
[16542.38s -> 16548.86s]  Stick around for the bits if you want to. What am I going to do on Wednesday?
[16548.86s -> 16555.37s]  I don't know. There's a... I could dedicate
[16555.37s -> 16559.74s]  Wednesday to Mind Show. Or I might put the
[16559.74s -> 16564.23s]  VR away for like another three or four streams. Still going to play...
[16564.23s -> 16568.47s]  Channel 5. Seaman. We still have that. That's been kicking around
[16568.47s -> 16580.46s]  for a while. Ace Attorney Trilogy comes out on the 10th of April, yeah?
[16580.46s -> 16590.04s]  Oh man, oh man. There's a lot to do. Stupid Invaders
[16590.04s -> 16597.99s]  Disc 1. You know, it's true. Let's get the outro going here.
[16597.99s -> 16608.12s]  Yeah, a lot of people
[16608.12s -> 16612.12s]  have been watching these streams. I'm
[16612.12s -> 16616.12s]  very happy that people are liking them. There's been a lot of positive
[16616.12s -> 16620.12s]  feedback on the VR stream, so I'm really happy.
[16620.12s -> 16628.78s]  I'm glad it can be fun. It's a very enjoyable experience,
[16628.78s -> 16635.38s]  I think. At least for me. At least for you too. Do Onward?
[16635.38s -> 16640.07s]  Yeah, we'll have to do it. I have it now, so it's time to do a bunch of it.
[16640.07s -> 16651.78s]  Let me close out of this. Finish Dreadhalls?
[16651.78s -> 16655.78s]  Yeah, we'll do like a finish the game stream. Not
[16655.78s -> 16660.28s]  necessarily on Wednesday, but I'm not sure. I'll be around. I'll be around in the Discord.
[16660.28s -> 16664.28s]  I'll be around in the chat here
[16664.28s -> 16671.27s]  in like a day or so. We'll talk about what we're going to do.
[16671.27s -> 16681.90s]  But I am pooped, as they say.
[16681.90s -> 16685.90s]  Let's head back a little earlier, a few hours ago, about four and a half hours ago.
[16685.90s -> 16702.22s]  Where do we start here? Yeah, right there.
[16702.22s -> 16706.52s]  Thank you to Divus five hours ago for the 250.
[16706.52s -> 16712.10s]  Appreciate it. Also thank you to
[16712.10s -> 16717.24s]  Take Me Home for the 250. You can set SteamVR to show your
[16717.24s -> 16721.67s]  IRL surroundings if you get close to a wall. Yeah, it's already there.
[16721.67s -> 16726.30s]  I have the blue thing set up, but when you get heated, you get
[16726.30s -> 16730.86s]  in the moment. It's so hard, because you're focused on
[16730.86s -> 16734.86s]  what's happening in the game. And even with the blue bars,
[16734.86s -> 16750.41s]  it can be very, very hard to avoid them. Oh, there they are.
[16750.41s -> 16754.90s]  No, it straight shows your room, not just the blue bars.
[16754.90s -> 16761.05s]  Oh, really? It shows the room? That's
[16761.05s -> 16766.31s]  weird. It's just a learn thing. The longer you play VR, you sort of remember your
[16766.31s -> 16772.09s]  space better, but accents still happen. It's a lot of fun.
[16772.09s -> 16777.29s]  Frody and Weapon Thanks for the $5 JermaJex, JermaJex 2.
[16777.29s -> 16781.29s]  There were two or three Jex moments tonight.
[16781.29s -> 16786.58s]  There were at least seven or eight
[16786.58s -> 16791.27s]  John moments. And there was probably 30 Jeremy moments.
[16791.27s -> 16798.94s]  So, it balances out, I think. Is there a
[16798.94s -> 16803.75s]  top 10 JermaScreaming clips from this stream? I don't think there's very much screaming.
[16803.75s -> 16809.78s]  No, that was a few days ago. This wasn't a scream stream.
[16809.78s -> 16813.78s]  This was like a try-hard shooter stream.
[16813.78s -> 16826.52s]  Like Star was saying before, imagine PavlovVR
[16826.52s -> 16831.90s]  in a competitive LAN setup, and they're all up there
[16831.90s -> 16835.90s]  like game show contestants hooked up to different helmets instead of computers.
[16835.90s -> 16845.05s]  That'd be wild. And then if they die, there's like a trap door that opens
[16845.05s -> 16849.05s]  and they fall out of their VR headsets and go through the trap door.
[16849.05s -> 16859.53s]  But thank you to
[16859.53s -> 16864.22s]  the Nintendo PlayStation for the $5 here.
[16864.22s -> 16869.22s]  Been watching you for a long time since TF2 2014.
[16869.22s -> 16874.74s]  Thank you. Really appreciate it. And you're currently playing Homeworld 2.
[16874.74s -> 16880.01s]  Homeworld 2. With like a Star Wars mod?
[16880.01s -> 16886.17s]  They had Star Wars mods for Homeworld?
[16886.17s -> 16892.26s]  That's kind of insane. But thank you, Nintendo PlayStation, for the $5 here.
[16892.26s -> 16896.50s]  Or actually $7 here, $7.50.
[16896.50s -> 16901.77s]  And they say the heavy machine gun you use is an MK48.
[16901.77s -> 16905.94s]  The gun appears in so many games like Black Ops 2 and it's even
[16905.94s -> 16913.18s]  in GTA 4. The huge one? Yeah.
[16913.18s -> 16921.38s]  That gun is in like every game, isn't it? That fold-out
[16921.38s -> 16926.01s]  like futon gun. I call that thing, that's a futon.
[16926.01s -> 16937.67s]  It's just a huge fold-out machine gun. Bro luck!
[16937.67s -> 16941.67s]  Thank you for the $2.50. Don't know if you've seen this yet. I'm not sure.
[16941.67s -> 16946.94s]  I'll tell you about it. Hello Moto.
[16946.94s -> 16953.99s]  I have not seen this. I'm not sure why I would want to see this.
[16953.99s -> 16972.87s]  Hello Moto Ring.
[16972.87s -> 17057.43s]  Oh shit. I've been like talking this whole time.
[17057.43s -> 17061.74s]  I don't know why that muted.
[17061.74s -> 17067.06s]  He's stuck in the, what was the last thing you heard me say? Motorola?
[17067.06s -> 17072.33s]  Oh god. Well I said, I talked about
[17072.33s -> 17076.33s]  D. Reggie Deddy gave me $3 and wrote something about a
[17076.33s -> 17080.33s]  flamethrower. It's an RPG combined.
[17080.33s -> 17084.33s]  It's like a plasma in the gun. And it's a link to
[17084.33s -> 17088.95s]  I don't even know what it is. It's a weird looking little gun thing.
[17088.95s -> 17093.64s]  You were just playing the music and nothing else.
[17093.64s -> 17097.64s]  We just heard the music.
[17097.64s -> 17102.44s]  I'm tired. I don't know.
[17102.44s -> 17113.90s]  This is what it looks like apparently. I have no idea.
[17113.90s -> 17119.35s]  Thank you Core Monster for the $15. That was a load of fun.
[17119.35s -> 17123.35s]  I was bargain binned with the pink avatar. Hope you can do this another time.
[17123.35s -> 17130.41s]  I was looking forward to this shit and it did not disappoint.
[17130.41s -> 17135.22s]  Thank you. Glad to have people participate if they can.
[17135.22s -> 17141.24s]  Sometimes it's hard to do. It can be tricky sometimes
[17141.24s -> 17145.61s]  with the amount of people that show up to streams.
[17145.61s -> 17149.61s]  I like to do community stuff when I can. Involve people if they want to play.
[17149.61s -> 17158.38s]  Thank you for the $15. Appreciate it. Glad you had fun. Cause it was fun.
[17158.38s -> 17164.20s]  I might not be the best VR shooter, but I tried.
[17164.20s -> 17175.02s]  Thank you again Core Monster for the $15.
[17175.02s -> 17180.47s]  Thank you also to Nintendo Playstation for $12.
[17180.47s -> 17186.74s]  I have an idea. Get VR troopers.
[17186.74s -> 17192.63s]  It's a better headset. I disagree.
[17192.63s -> 17200.57s]  Thank you though.
[17200.57s -> 17208.26s]  I'm going sicko.
[17208.26s -> 17212.76s]  I didn't do very well for a lot of those.
[17212.76s -> 17216.76s]  There was a few rounds of the gun game.
[17216.76s -> 17220.76s]  I was really feeling it. I could just feel the weight.
[17220.76s -> 17225.58s]  I was pretending. You have to actually move your arms.
[17225.58s -> 17231.61s]  I came into fourth place one of those times.
[17231.61s -> 17241.27s]  Sick Jax.
[17241.27s -> 17246.41s]  Sicko mode is a great song, but the meme is getting very old at this point.
[17246.41s -> 17254.10s]  I don't even know what it is. Poor Boomer has to do physical exercise.
[17254.10s -> 17258.10s]  What was me? I had to get up and move for four and a half hours.
[17258.10s -> 17267.78s]  Also we had the
[17267.78s -> 17272.09s]  Jewish Bro came in with about $4 here.
[17272.09s -> 17277.10s]  Could you play Seaman and more shitty games on Wednesday?
[17277.10s -> 17283.13s]  VR is fun, but let's go back to the basics.
[17283.13s -> 17287.75s]  I'm of the opinion. If I'm having a good time, I'm going to keep having a good time.
[17287.75s -> 17293.34s]  I definitely don't want to do exclusively
[17293.34s -> 17297.34s]  only VR, but it is a brand new toy.
[17297.34s -> 17307.08s]  I was tired after just the Pavlov match. That's a lot of exertion.
[17307.08s -> 17311.08s]  Jerma did Climey and Gorn today.
[17311.08s -> 17315.38s]  Before Climey, Star's computer broke in the chef game.
[17315.38s -> 17325.56s]  Any plans to go to the furry convention in Chicago? Yeah, I'll be there.
[17325.56s -> 17330.31s]  I think they say, can you pull an all-nighter and see how long you last?
[17330.31s -> 17335.26s]  No, I don't stream all night.
[17335.26s -> 17343.58s]  I can't do that. Let's get the credits going up too.
[17343.58s -> 17349.61s]  All the new subs and resubs, thank you guys.
[17349.61s -> 17355.05s]  And his rat costume? No, his frog costume.
[17355.05s -> 17359.35s]  Just want to make sure everyone's really clear. Frog.
[17359.35s -> 17363.35s]  Oh, is he a rat? Is he a...
[17363.35s -> 17369.32s]  Maybe he's a fox? Nope. Frog. If I had to pick.
[17369.32s -> 17375.21s]  Frogs don't have fur. That doesn't matter.
[17375.21s -> 17381.86s]  Could be a froggy. Why do you enable them?
[17381.86s -> 17393.40s]  It's fun. And we had Bingo Sunshine for $5. Thank you, Bingo.
[17393.40s -> 17398.02s]  Whoops. You missed that one. Try another VR stream.
[17398.02s -> 17414.04s]  Okay, then. I'll be a penguin. See you there.
[17414.04s -> 17422.04s]  Someone's going to edit that clip and just cut out you saying
[17422.04s -> 17427.56s]  just kidding. Well, people have their...
[17427.56s -> 17433.64s]  The internet's a powerful place. I've said this before.
[17433.64s -> 17439.10s]  Think of how many sentences I've said being recorded on a microphone.
[17439.10s -> 17443.40s]  I have said every single word. If you were dedicated
[17443.40s -> 17447.40s]  enough, you could make an entire audiobook
[17447.40s -> 17451.40s]  of me saying anything you wanted over the course of like
[17451.40s -> 17457.22s]  four or five hundred pages. You could make anything.
[17457.22s -> 17461.22s]  And you could write a whole book and have me be the narrator
[17461.22s -> 17471.86s]  with different clips. You could just make an AI to view your videos and recreate
[17471.86s -> 17479.48s]  you in your entirety.
[17479.48s -> 17483.48s]  I haven't said every word.
[17483.48s -> 17506.26s]  Relax. I see my name. Time to watch every
[17506.26s -> 17512.87s]  Jerma stream and make sure he's said every single word.
[17512.87s -> 17532.79s]  Streamer lies. Jiggle it a little. It'll open.
[17532.79s -> 17539.70s]  Oh my god. I've never swore on stream.
[17539.70s -> 17544.71s]  Yes, I have. I think I swore every like eight minutes
[17544.71s -> 17556.12s]  today. You've never said... No, I'm not saying
[17556.12s -> 17563.67s]  words. But the next time I see you guys will be
[17563.67s -> 17567.91s]  on Wednesday. Have a nice relaxing start to your week.
[17567.91s -> 17571.91s]  Thank you for joining me on the VR stuff last couple of days. And we did VR
[17571.91s -> 17580.38s]  three days ago too, right? Four days ago? Thanks everybody again
[17580.38s -> 17586.47s]  for hanging out. Hope you have a good time. Take care everybody.
[17586.47s -> 17590.47s]  And Nintendo PlayStation with $2.50 right at the end. Hey Jerma, can you say
[17590.47s -> 17594.47s]  like... No. I'm not gonna say the thing from...
[17594.47s -> 17598.47s]  I almost said Breaking Bad. No. What's that show with
[17598.47s -> 17603.74s]  the nerds? It's like a nerd show. Earth. It's called like
[17603.74s -> 17610.98s]  at the... We're at the Earth. The Big Bang.
[17610.98s -> 17614.98s]  Yeah. I don't want to say the Sheldon catchphrase.
[17614.98s -> 17623.86s]  But I'll see you guys soon. Take care. Have a nice one.
[17623.86s -> 17630.14s]  And goodbye. Eat your vegetables. And drink your fucking water.
[17630.14s -> 17652.66s]  Like I'm gonna go down water right now. See you later guys.
