[0.82s -> 17.67s]  Hey, too early? That's right. I've got to be better at this stream starting soon screen,
[17.67s -> 25.42s]  I think. Because here's the thing, I feel like when I sit here and I'm ready to start streaming,
[26.92s -> 35.32s]  I press this turn on stream button, start streaming, and then I'm ready to stream.
[38.42s -> 43.22s]  So I feel like I should just press that button and then like go get... but I'm here. I'm ready.
[43.94s -> 49.34s]  It's kind of an awkward situation where I press the button and I'm just sitting here just looking
[49.34s -> 57.61s]  at chat waiting to unmute. And like should I do it now? Should I do it in like two minutes?
[58.33s -> 65.50s]  I guess take a sip of my water. There's a maybe a handful of scenarios where that screen's been on
[66.30s -> 74.74s]  and I've had to go to the bathroom quick. Some streamers do a full 10 to 20 minutes of a starting
[74.74s -> 83.85s]  soon screen. I've seen like five minutes starting soons, 10 minute, 20 minute. I feel like that's
[83.85s -> 109.91s]  too much for me. Some do 50 minutes. An hour? A full hour? Holy shit. I guess it makes sense
[109.91s -> 116.65s]  for people that stream very long on Twitch. I guess if you press the start streaming button
[116.65s -> 123.66s]  and you stream for like 12 hours, it's not that big of a deal. And there's another argument there
[123.66s -> 131.77s]  where, well, most people don't even come to the stream until 30, 40 plus minutes have gone by.
[131.77s -> 139.75s]  So I guess it makes sense. Some people are just hopping in on notifications after 10, 20 minutes.
[139.75s -> 145.46s]  I guess it makes sense. But my attention span, if I press the start streaming button... I don't know.
[146.58s -> 163.42s]  I'm concerned. If I press the start... I just got burped murdered is what happened. Somebody just
[163.42s -> 169.05s]  came up behind me and murdered me and burped at the same time. God. All right. Anyways.
[171.14s -> 177.66s]  So anyways, what was I saying? Right. I would be afraid that if I had my stream just going
[177.66s -> 184.78s]  on my computer up here for like 35, 40 straight minutes, me internally would always think that
[184.78s -> 191.48s]  is a mic on? What if they hear me like singing in the shower? What if they hear me blowing my nose?
[191.48s -> 202.78s]  What if I... There's a lot of mic unmuted scenarios that could happen there. But no, usually I usually
[202.78s -> 214.36s]  do about two or three minutes and then about five minutes total until we do it like that.
[214.36s -> 222.30s]  So today we're going to do Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion HD remake HD renovation.
[224.87s -> 229.11s]  The reason why we're doing this instead of Darkwood is I just want to break it up a little
[229.75s -> 236.65s]  because I want to play more Darkwood, but I don't want to play Darkwood like three days in a row.
[236.65s -> 241.77s]  I'd rather do this first and however long if this takes five, six, seven hours, then whatever.
[241.77s -> 248.38s]  We will go back to Darkwood tomorrow. But if this is like three hours or less, if this is only a
[248.38s -> 254.94s]  couple hours, I've heard this can range between like two and six hours. So whatever the case is,
[254.94s -> 263.69s]  we're streaming tomorrow too. We'll see. It has this music that's just playing.
[264.89s -> 271.50s]  This is a very highly requested game. I got this request a bunch of times and if I don't like the
[271.50s -> 275.66s]  game, then I'm just gonna play Darkwood. If the game is short, I'm gonna play Darkwood.
[276.46s -> 283.00s]  Gonna play Darkwood tomorrow. So we'll see more Darkwood. I 100% guarantee if there's no Darkwood
[283.00s -> 291.16s]  tomorrow, then actually I can't say this. What if I like break my leg? Okay, so if I stream...
[291.16s -> 301.34s]  Never mind. I'm ready. This is Darkwood. It's not Darkwood. This is Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion.
[302.30s -> 305.19s]  I don't know much about this game. All I know about this game is that
[306.31s -> 309.75s]  I don't want to play endless mode. You have to go through a bunch of rooms and they all jump scare.
[309.75s -> 314.47s]  So by the way, I need to make this very clear. This game is going to flash you. It's going to
[314.47s -> 318.63s]  make loud noises. It's going to scream and it's going to flash the screen and shit. So just be
[318.63s -> 324.86s]  aware of that. Be careful. Okay, the mansion. Renovator version of the original. Why don't
[324.86s -> 329.98s]  I just do that one? Unlock the secrets of the strange hospital. Build your own mansion. All
[329.98s -> 339.74s]  right. We're going to just do the regular one. The one that... This one. Is this part of the game?
[340.46s -> 363.86s]  Do I actually like fight the controller? Okay. So, uh, welcome. We're in room zero.
[364.50s -> 381.61s]  Is there a punch? First jump scare. Okay. I have to do a thousand of these.
[388.18s -> 405.06s]  I gotta turn it up. This is too quiet. Yeah, I... Jump scare is on. What if I turn them off?
[406.01s -> 414.09s]  What's the point of playing the game? I'm going to play Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion.
[415.61s -> 422.57s]  But, like, story mode. It's just baby mode. Put it at 69. No. I'll do 50 where it should be.
[423.37s -> 427.29s]  This is... I turned off motion blur. I would... I had to tell you about that, too, because that's
[427.29s -> 436.15s]  fucked up. Uh, apply. Better. No, it's louder for you now. I'm turning it down. All right, let's go.
[436.15s -> 445.48s]  Uh, Jump Scare Mansion. Turn the DPI down on my mouse, please. Is there a DPI button? Input. Mouse.
[447.37s -> 473.99s]  UI. No. In game. Where's my DPI reducer? I missed it. It was there. In game. Oh, it's...
[475.66s -> 488.47s]  Look down. 1.0. Okay, I'm gonna... I... You do eight. No, seven. Let's see if that's better.
[493.56s -> 501.94s]  Yeah, that feels better. All right, let's go. So, um, this is Jump Scare Mansion. I'm going to assume
[501.94s -> 508.17s]  that every single room screams at you. Is that for real? Because, I mean, I'm... I know that's
[508.17s -> 517.82s]  gonna happen now. I know that somebody's gonna scream in my face, right here. You've kind of
[517.82s -> 529.83s]  given away the whole point of the game. Is this it? What'd it say? At first, this place just seemed
[529.83s -> 534.95s]  cute, but I've been here for days now. Feeling quite parched now, and I keep getting this feeling
[534.95s -> 548.82s]  like I'm being watched by something. This is not romantic at all. It's Jump Scare Mansion. Thank
[548.82s -> 557.91s]  God I only had one coffee today. But that's the thing. If you know it's gonna happen, how do they
[557.91s -> 571.00s]  get you when you... Okay, pumpkin's in the walls. Person in the ceiling. Something outside? No. It's
[571.00s -> 582.97s]  a cloud. Can I open... draw? Something's gonna come out of the... draw. No. That's nothing in here.
[583.61s -> 588.26s]  I've been playing too much Darkwood, which, by the way, it's coming back soon. In a day or so.
[588.26s -> 618.41s]  What's that? This is a puzzle game. I have two ways to go now. Uh, left or right door? Is this...
[618.41s -> 632.57s]  Is this a bigger room? Oh, okay. Pick the middle one. I got the bad end. Choices matter. Is that...
[632.57s -> 661.03s]  Are you kidding? Or is that real? All right, I'm almost, um, 1% of the way there. Right? This game
[661.03s -> 665.67s]  takes four hours to beat. I guess that makes sense. You just have to walk through a thousand rooms.
[666.47s -> 674.25s]  All right, I'm gonna go... I went left before. I'm gonna go right now. What's... I have a health bar.
[674.25s -> 689.88s]  What's the energy bar for? For the Jump Scare Mansion, you've got one jump scare in 13 rooms,
[689.88s -> 699.91s]  and it was pumpkin. Can I go back through the other door? No. There's got to be another
[699.91s -> 706.15s]  jump scare coming up. Was it every, like, 20 rooms? Every... Yep, there it is. Here he is.
[707.27s -> 712.87s]  I know something is following me, but I feel like I'm prancing through the same rooms over and over.
[712.87s -> 717.67s]  Right? Hopefully leaving notes as breadcrumbs will prove I'm making progress in reaching some
[717.67s -> 728.58s]  destination. I just hope I don't run out of ink. I'm dreadfully thirsty. This is me leaving these
[728.58s -> 737.13s]  notes because I'm stuck in a time loop. Pumpkin scared him more. Yep, because pumpkin made a
[737.13s -> 769.46s]  noise. It made a loud, like... The skeleton just showed up. Oh, maze time. Okay. 18. Holy shit,
[769.46s -> 780.71s]  that's a sprint. You can sprint, and it goes too fast. I'm not using the sprint. There's a lot of
[780.71s -> 793.05s]  doors here. This one. Bed. Are there items? I don't think so. I think I get it. I think you
[793.05s -> 807.75s]  just keep going. It only happens twice. Wasn't I in this room before? Oh, please don't tell me
[807.75s -> 811.59s]  this is one of these games where you have to... It's like a maze, and you have to figure out the
[811.59s -> 846.17s]  maze. I went in the left door last time. Or... Am I going... What's wrong with my neck? Somebody just
[846.17s -> 865.82s]  said neck. Your neck. Your neck. What's wrong with it? I think I'm doing something wrong. Yep, I have
[866.54s -> 871.26s]  ink. Not quite quenching my thirst. Taste is terrible. Stains are terrible. I don't think
[871.26s -> 877.32s]  drinking it was a very romantic idea. Why is everything romantic? I am leaving these notes
[878.44s -> 884.18s]  because I remember the little skeleton body here. He's gonna jump up right now. No? Okay.
[885.62s -> 910.20s]  It's gonna happen like a hundred more times because it doesn't matter if something's scary
[910.20s -> 914.20s]  or not, or if you know it's gonna happen. If somebody just jumps in front of you and yells,
[914.20s -> 921.26s]  you're gonna be like, oh! See? I know they're happening, but it doesn't matter. It's a
[921.26s -> 931.61s]  startling thing. It looks like they've increased the frequency of these. You can always tell when
[931.61s -> 934.81s]  I really actually get scared by something. We talked about this yesterday during Darkwood, but
[935.45s -> 941.37s]  if my hand comes up and I start to play the guitar in the air, that means that's a real reaction.
[941.85s -> 955.85s]  Any other time, if I'm like, whoa! No, that's bullshit. Bullshit. I start playing an invisible
[955.85s -> 989.24s]  flute. Oh, yeah. Terrified. I've only done 36 of these. It's the constant running that I think
[989.24s -> 1012.89s]  gets you because your brain is going forward and then it... What's that? I found something today
[1012.89s -> 1018.73s]  to satisfy my unromantic thirst. I woke today from a brief faint and found before me a bottle
[1018.73s -> 1025.51s]  of red wine. This is me. I'm not sure what brand or year, but there is no label. All I gather is
[1025.51s -> 1044.71s]  that it tastes strongly metallic. Okay. I'm gonna pre yell too. I think that'll help too. If my body
[1044.71s -> 1049.19s]  is ready and I'm like tensed already, if I scream beforehand, I won't scream at the actual jump
[1049.27s -> 1066.79s]  scare. I think it works. People are gonna think I'm fucking crazy.
[1077.19s -> 1110.50s]  I need to test my hypothesis. You have to exhale too. No inhale. Exhale. Because then you can't go...
[1114.82s -> 1143.80s]  I'm just gonna do pregnancy classes. Locked. Okay. Keep a little pep in your step.
[1143.80s -> 1157.85s]  I'm just waiting for everything to do it. You can do it. We can help. Papa John's. Papa John's
[1157.85s -> 1176.18s]  sucks, by the way. Oh, it's a save point. All right. It does not. I mean, it does. It's not
[1176.18s -> 1189.96s]  very good. Papa Gino is way better than Papa John's. Like a thousand times better. Those of you
[1189.96s -> 1195.32s]  that don't know Papa Gino's, you don't know the true meaning of like chain pizza. It's because
[1195.32s -> 1208.14s]  his name is Gino. No, that's not why. I mean, that helps. It's not the reason. Can I crouch?
[1227.06s -> 1255.13s]  Okay. 51. We're almost 5.1% of the way there. You are here. Where? I think that's the point.
[1255.93s -> 1269.90s]  This is a good map. Sounds like something's at the end of this hall.
[1282.84s -> 1286.36s]  This is why I can't do these games. And you wonder, whoa, where's Scare Saturdays? Scare
[1286.36s -> 1292.23s]  Saturdays used to hurt me. That's why every Saturday I would just be like, I have to do
[1292.23s -> 1297.11s]  another one of these and I don't want to do it. But it was Saturday. So I had to do it because I
[1297.11s -> 1303.11s]  said, I'm going to Scare Saturdays every Saturday. After doing that for like four or five, six weeks
[1303.11s -> 1313.34s]  in a row, I was like, I, it's Friday and how do I not do this on Saturday? I thought it was fun for
[1313.34s -> 1326.81s]  like eight weeks in a row. He hates streaming. No. What does it have to do with streaming?
[1328.39s -> 1335.11s]  That has nothing to do with live streaming. It's scary jump in your face games. They make me ill.
[1340.98s -> 1347.30s]  That's like saying, oh, that chef really doesn't like stabbing himself in the chest with his
[1347.30s -> 1375.46s]  kitchen knife. He must hate, he hates cooking. He hates cooking. He hates, he hates streaming.
[1375.46s -> 1389.75s]  Slime. It's going to pop up. Or it's that, this is a red herring. This is a, this is a red herring.
[1389.75s -> 1398.66s]  It's going to come over here. Yep. This is a red herring. Spouting, splashing, soaking, innards,
[1398.66s -> 1407.93s]  ingest, invoking, nailing never stops the choking. I told you, I told you it was going to get up.
[1408.81s -> 1417.11s]  Uh, this health in the game, they have a health bar. Wait, they all get up. Wait,
[1417.11s -> 1427.82s]  they, he's following me around in every room. No, he's not. Please, please. You think I'm going
[1427.82s -> 1450.60s]  to pay attention to the little ghost? He is chasing me through every room. There's no jump. Oh, good
[1450.60s -> 1482.38s]  thing I didn't go to the chair route. I'm good. How long does this last for? This is not just for
[1482.38s -> 1507.53s]  the rest of the game, right? Another, another, like, like 932 floors of this. Hey, I can't go
[1507.53s -> 1570.79s]  in that door. I think I'm safe. Okay. I got it. Fucking dot on me. He's taking poison damage.
[1571.35s -> 1587.99s]  I can hate this. I don't, it doesn't matter. I, there's a thousand of these rooms. Why would
[1587.99s -> 1599.42s]  I do this? Of like the four to 5,000 of you that requested this. It was, it was actually like six
[1599.42s -> 1616.14s]  people, but still. Wait for that to recharge. Seven. He just really doesn't. He just hates
[1616.14s -> 1628.33s]  streaming. He doesn't want, he hates streaming. It's like, I think that's like my favorite comment.
[1628.33s -> 1648.07s]  It'll last like a week. Almost 10% of the way there. It's been 30 minutes. So that's a hundred
[1648.07s -> 1661.67s]  rooms in 30 minutes, which means that's 10%. So three, six, nine, 12, 14, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30.
[1661.67s -> 1668.95s]  This is going to take three hours. That was the easiest math problem ever. And I made that so
[1668.95s -> 1690.81s]  much more complicated for no reason. Oh, there's another one of these guys. This is how many? Two?
[1690.81s -> 1700.01s]  All right. Just stay ahead of them. Here comes, we're going to be one in the hallway here. It's
[1700.01s -> 1738.39s]  going to be like boom. Almost at a hundred. Ninety-five. Floor a hundred. 10% of the way
[1738.39s -> 1746.38s]  there. Keep that blood pumping. I'm actually all right. So I've completed 10% of the game.
[1746.38s -> 1765.05s]  This is your breather. Every 50 rooms. I saved it, right? Yeah. This is going to take you five
[1765.05s -> 1771.85s]  hours. Why would it take me five hours? I just have to go into different halls and open doors
[1771.85s -> 1779.83s]  900 more times. So there are only 60 minutes in an hour. So one room per minute. No, it's one.
[1779.83s -> 1794.12s]  No, that's not how it works. Why would I spend one minute in each room? What happened to the
[1794.12s -> 1805.26s]  little ghost person at the beginning? It was just like, hi, welcome to my castle. And then they've
[1805.26s -> 1843.72s]  gone. New environment. It's beige now. Cat dos. What do you mean cat dos? Should I enter cat dos?
[1847.72s -> 1866.09s]  Press it. Enter cat dos. Access specimen database. Modify house layout. Specimen one. Cat dos. Type
[1866.09s -> 1871.61s]  docile. Total fatalities four from heart attack. Cardboard cutout figure that springs out from the
[1871.61s -> 1884.68s]  walls. Prove not very effective against healthy subjects. Cat dos two. Active. 137 fatalities.
[1884.68s -> 1891.58s]  Method physical tearing. A mostly semi-solid base specter that frequently changes matter states.
[1891.58s -> 1901.93s]  Prove very effective against weaker or slower subjects. What was spoiler three? Hidden testing.
[1901.93s -> 1908.71s]  43 infectious bites. A test specimen being developed at GL labs should prove useful when
[1908.71s -> 1920.50s]  released. Trials have shown it is adequately effective to average subjects. Method consumption.
[1920.50s -> 1927.21s]  A 14th century spirit that was contained and relocated here. Tests have yet to reveal origins,
[1927.21s -> 1932.22s]  but all relevant information has been placed into testing chamber. Proved effective, but not
[1932.22s -> 1941.80s]  greatly more than previous specimens. A creature found inside the church of a small town. Subjects
[1941.80s -> 1951.21s]  are lost after contact with the specimen. The bloodbath of killing is unknown. Proved extremely
[1951.21s -> 1963.42s]  effective against subjects with mental issues or weak wills. All right. Modify house layout error.
[1963.42s -> 1978.15s]  Exit program. And one of these is going to be in the room. Not in this room. There's going to be
[1978.15s -> 1999.50s]  all kind of this. There's going to be five different cat doses. Is this one of the cat doses? Bang! Up
[1999.50s -> 2006.62s]  against the wall. Yep. No, come on. Do it like sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint. What's that in
[2006.62s -> 2009.74s]  the distance? Sprint, sprint, sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, and then wicked
[2009.74s -> 2037.21s]  close. But wait, are these are these YouTubers that have been scared by the game? All right.
[2040.66s -> 2046.54s]  That's, that's so funny. Why am I not on that wall? I, because I've not, I haven't played this game.
[2048.22s -> 2073.83s]  I had nothing to do with this game. What do you mean you're next? No, I'm not. We are almost,
[2073.83s -> 2093.59s]  we are almost 11% of the way through this game. Green room. Music's getting louder.
[2099.90s -> 2105.86s]  Green room two. Something coming up out of the water. No, something coming up on the left side.
[2116.10s -> 2119.54s]  It's going to be here. It's going to be in here. I mean, you don't have the fog. Well,
[2119.70s -> 2134.78s]  that was the door. I know what you're going to do. Just do it already. Ding, ding. What do you mean
[2134.78s -> 2153.40s]  ding? Ding, donk, donk, donk, ding. So it was right, left, right, right. That's a double ding.
[2153.40s -> 2195.08s]  Straight, right, right, right, right, ding. One and fifteen. Music's getting louder.
[2197.00s -> 2202.78s]  I thought they got rid of these because they were more effective. These are more effective
[2202.78s -> 2209.64s]  than the monsters. Look at my reactions I had to the green I'm going to kill you monster versus
[2209.64s -> 2217.74s]  the paper cutout that's like an emoji sticker. Not this time. I don't think that was wine.
[2218.38s -> 2228.62s]  What was it? It's the test poison that you drink in it. I'm not going to just use filler words and
[2228.62s -> 2233.18s]  just use words just to talk, just be talking instead to distract myself from what's happening
[2233.18s -> 2239.34s]  on the screen. I'm not going to do that because doing that would mean that I'm trying to fill
[2239.34s -> 2243.42s]  air in my head to distract myself from the thing that's going to jump out in front of me in about
[2243.42s -> 2262.81s]  15 to 25 seconds give or take maybe a little bit there. Same thing. This is new. Needs a key card.
[2263.69s -> 2279.21s]  Please. Uh oh. I made this character in that wrestling game. That's the gum guy.
[2280.01s -> 2283.32s]  They're going to break out of these probably or something.
[2284.65s -> 2301.02s]  Geez. Yeah something broke out. See there's an empty one. Okay PG YouTuber activated. Oh crap.
[2302.68s -> 2320.92s]  Oh no. Oh oh goodness. What the heck happened? Blood. Subject five is growing more and more
[2320.92s -> 2326.84s]  restless. I told Spook we need more funds for sedatives but she just laughed and flew into the
[2326.84s -> 2331.32s]  ceiling without more chemicals to keep these things docile. I'm not sure how much longer
[2331.32s -> 2337.08s]  we can keep them here. Got the key card. Subject five is growing more and more restless. I told
[2337.08s -> 2350.18s]  Spook we need more and more sedatives okay. He does this joke every game. I got it. I gotta keep
[2350.18s -> 2366.02s]  it going you know what I mean. It's tradition at this point. Look behind you in real life. Well not
[2366.02s -> 2370.66s]  every game. Only games where I have a facecam on. All right I'll give you that. If I have a facecam
[2370.66s -> 2378.10s]  turned on I'm going to do the YouTube person with 400 episodes. Yeah that's what happens.
[2378.74s -> 2382.18s]  You have to deal with it for like the two or three minutes that I do it out of like 12 hours.
[2382.82s -> 2401.96s]  Come on. I believe subject five is loose. The glass around its container is shattered and I
[2401.96s -> 2406.28s]  can faintly hear clicking coming from the ceiling. I don't know what will happen now but it's out
[2406.28s -> 2416.70s]  and alive. This is probably my last report. The clicking is getting louder now. It's behind me.
[2417.66s -> 2422.87s]  I want to see what it looks like. Oh there's a bug.
[2435.88s -> 2440.25s]  That was pretty funny. All right they come out of these the clicker ceilings.
[2441.05s -> 2468.50s]  He's fast. He just keeps breaking the doors. Great. Oh great. Oh great. Oh great. Oh no. Oh crap.
[2468.58s -> 2500.46s]  There's like a hundred of them. Oh no. Oh jeez. Oh crap. I do that every fucking stream too.
[2500.46s -> 2512.34s]  I gotta get the fuck out of here. I know it's behind me. Just don't even look at it. This is
[2512.34s -> 2526.55s]  a good way to burn through rooms though. It's the same exact room. You do it too early. You missed
[2526.55s -> 2553.03s]  your cue. 150, 150, 150. So I can stop this mute of these. Is he here still? Get the gunk out of
[2553.03s -> 2560.89s]  your ears. What implying that I didn't hear you say something? That's what you say to somebody
[2560.89s -> 2566.12s]  that's not listening to you. You're talking to somebody and they're not paying attention.
[2566.92s -> 2569.96s]  Hey what time is the bus? What time are we going? What time are we getting on the bus?
[2570.60s -> 2575.40s]  Hey get the gunk out of your ears. And they're like whoa what the heck? What are you talking
[2575.40s -> 2604.95s]  about? Really dry lips. Will you pay attention to the game please? Saved it. Hang in there. We're
[2604.95s -> 2609.67s]  only at 15 percent. What do you want me to click while I have a second here? Look at the link.
[2609.67s -> 2655.59s]  Click this link. That's pretty. Okay that's pretty fun. But I wasn't playing a scary game there.
[2655.59s -> 2666.98s]  150 let's go. That wasn't me playing a scary game. That was me putting tape all over my body
[2667.62s -> 2687.45s]  without a scary game. Get scared or riot. Chop till you drop axe. What was the image? I missed it.
[2690.62s -> 2705.88s]  Well you missed it. Sorry. All right let's go. I'm speed running my way to one uh for 200.
[2706.36s -> 2715.88s]  Now this is different. It's not that bad. It's not that bad. I'll do it. I'll get to a thousand.
[2717.82s -> 2721.82s]  They're gonna introduce more monsters. There's gonna be one in the ceiling. There'll be one in
[2721.82s -> 2738.02s]  the rafters. There'll be one coming out of the wall. Oh shit. What the hell is this? He's still
[2738.02s -> 2751.69s]  behind me isn't he? You take 160 floors to introduce the flashlight mechanic. Oh shit. This is like a
[2751.69s -> 2763.54s]  classroom read. Read the notes. Something's gonna be at a desk. I can't get out of here. Something's
[2763.54s -> 2784.55s]  gonna be at a desk. What is in the desk? A key card. Something. There's nothing in here. I just
[2784.55s -> 2798.41s]  rewound a YouTube video. I didn't want to miss my favorite part. Okay there's a note here.
[2801.00s -> 2814.84s]  Matsuri never came to class today. Oh she made it home. Okay. Hey what Harry? What? I looked at a
[2814.84s -> 2834.07s]  picture of a cat. It hurt me. That's great. Cool. Could really be true. I thought the fairy tales
[2834.07s -> 2839.27s]  about the ghost that eats children who sneak in after class was just to keep us from disobeying
[2839.27s -> 2859.03s]  but Matsuri is still missing. But where's the key to get out of here? I'm lost. There's a shadow over
[2859.03s -> 2887.03s]  there. Somebody in the corner. I see them. Is that me? What? That just hurt me. Okay I need to start
[2887.03s -> 2893.53s]  paying it to get some logical reasoning here. Which way am I going? This is back towards the
[2893.53s -> 2908.58s]  front. So it's here and then bang a left. Then bang a right. Out the door. Thank you. All right.
[2908.58s -> 2928.12s]  Okay. All right. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[2929.72s -> 2949.34s]  Three. Oh Undertale. Oh shit it's actually flying at me.
[2953.98s -> 2977.82s]  You are you bad at your cue. You missed your cue again. Shut up. Thank you.
[2992.82s -> 3010.94s]  This is how this music's too happy. I don't know how much longer I can go on. I haven't seen
[3010.94s -> 3015.26s]  any of my previous notes. That means either I'm getting somewhere or someone is taking them.
[3016.22s -> 3048.17s]  Chair. Don't go chair route. I've already got this taken care of. This way. Damn it. Wait. No.
[3049.34s -> 3061.72s]  Nothing. You got it taken chair of. I wish I came up with that but I didn't. Nice work.
[3065.62s -> 3082.20s]  I hear breathing. I'm not even at floor 200. Fucking idiot. I think this. I think this is
[3082.20s -> 3087.24s]  my last note. I'm going to die having never found my escape but really that's not true. This place
[3087.24s -> 3091.48s]  was like my escape. My escape from everything else in the end. My death is kind of romantic.
[3097.56s -> 3119.72s]  This romantic thing has really got me all twisted. This is a live stream twisted. So now I can read
[3119.72s -> 3125.64s]  chat for a second. What's up? This is romantic. How's that iced coffee? Oh it's not iced coffee.
[3125.64s -> 3133.08s]  This is water that I sprayed a little bit of lime lemon juice in. This is just to stay hydrated.
[3133.08s -> 3153.13s]  Bugs. It is water. Get this wrong. Okay. Chair. Which is the right... I didn't see it.
[3153.69s -> 3165.43s]  Going as fast as I can. Get out of here. Yeah. I know we're both playing Gmod Deathrun and I'm
[3165.43s -> 3190.52s]  going too slow for you but fuck off. I'm trying to enjoy the game. Nice. I almost hit 200.
[3197.93s -> 3207.53s]  200. What was that? This thing's looking at me. I'm not gonna say it. No. I'm not gonna say it.
[3207.53s -> 3213.64s]  Somebody else did. I refuse to say it. All right. So how's everybody doing? How's your day?
[3214.44s -> 3246.46s]  Make your face came bigger. Wow. That's not necessary. There you go. There you go.
[3247.98s -> 3290.15s]  200. Make it bigger. No. That's as big as it's gonna get. 204. Yeah. Any chance I can get to throw
[3290.15s -> 3297.34s]  that in? You better believe I'm gonna. Uh oh. This is like Slender Man graphic on me.
[3298.14s -> 3313.00s]  Why do I have like the Slender static? What? This is... This was such a surprise that there would
[3313.00s -> 3319.72s]  be another entry. Another actual entry. One I could admire but then as suddenly as it came it left
[3319.72s -> 3336.60s]  and now you disband. Your influence and inspiration will never leave me. Such a surprise.
[3337.24s -> 3350.98s]  Is that code for how I have to? Oh my fucking jaw hurts.
[3359.58s -> 3365.85s]  So that's what that means. Okay. That... It took 208 rooms. That was a real one for me.
[3366.73s -> 3378.18s]  It took 200 rooms to have that be a full-on... Like I was not ready for that one. Jumpscare mansion.
[3379.88s -> 3402.23s]  Oh fuck. Don't even... What's this? Hey. The darkness is slowly consuming us now. I don't
[3402.23s -> 3407.27s]  think our rituals will appease it much longer. How were we supposed to know this would happen?
[3411.86s -> 3424.95s]  Ah shit. Ah shit. It's not really our fault. We just did what mother has told us to do in
[3424.95s -> 3445.42s]  this sort of situation. Mother is not pleased with us but how were we supposed to know that
[3445.42s -> 3460.12s]  that girl wasn't pure? He's reading lore in the game. Yeah. I kind of want to know what's going on.
[3461.08s -> 3464.12s]  It's not really our fault. We did what mother told us to do.
[3465.64s -> 3473.64s]  This is probably... One of these is going to have somebody in it. The girl wasn't pure.
[3475.00s -> 3486.10s]  Ah. That's where I came from. If I cross my eyes like it won't be scary because I won't know what
[3486.10s -> 3534.25s]  it is. Except that hurts. Did it work? Kind of works. Safety squinting. What the fuck is happening
[3534.25s -> 3541.34s]  to you? All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Give me the 220.
[3541.98s -> 3544.94s]  Two... There's somebody... There's something following me. I don't know what it is.
[3546.70s -> 3554.38s]  I just want to see what it looks like. It's got a knife. But when it sees you it changes
[3554.38s -> 3576.39s]  your environment to be all fucky. Oh no. This is not good. Get out of my way. I... You are
[3576.39s -> 3589.96s]  meaningless to me now. I have to be honest. When I crossed my eyes like that for more than 10 seconds
[3589.96s -> 3604.57s]  I just... I... This hurts. My head hurts now. Oh nice. Arcade games. How do you control it?
[3604.57s -> 3624.09s]  It's gonna scream in my face. Oh I'm here. Wait. I have to... I'm the ghost. Hey! That's not very
[3624.09s -> 3648.84s]  nice. I can't believe Pac-Man is fucking dead. Wait. No. I'm the... Oh. I'm the ghost. Where...
[3650.30s -> 3655.29s]  Why am I doing this? I didn't even stab anybody.
[3664.46s -> 3672.17s]  Automatic plus letter grid. Now technically speaking I'm not driving the car. My character
[3672.17s -> 3682.76s]  is. This is a... This is a pretty good song. I'll give it a half letter grade for that.
[3683.56s -> 3695.61s]  Fucking... What are these people doing? Why are people just spinning around on the road?
[3696.57s -> 3714.25s]  What? What do... Oh. I'm... Okay. It's a big turn. Oh. I can run over stuff.
[3715.77s -> 3729.99s]  This is a good song. Here comes a demon face. Yeah. I know. I'm certain of it. That's why
[3729.99s -> 3756.97s]  I'm getting ready. How do I win? Here's the sad part about this. This is a better game
[3757.93s -> 3775.16s]  than any of the iPad GTA clones I played like five years ago. Do I have to eliminate all the
[3775.16s -> 3798.58s]  other cars? Alright. That's it. I win. I haven't... I didn't win. Checkpoint. Nitrous. How do I
[3798.58s -> 3810.34s]  activate nitrous? Every time I destroy a car my point... I... My time goes up. Just don't...
[3810.34s -> 3835.22s]  Don't kill any... Don't stop killing anybody. What? There's nobody else here. That was fun.
[3839.34s -> 3850.14s]  I can't leave the game. There's no exit. I can't walk this way. I'm driving the car backwards.
[3850.14s -> 3867.43s]  I'm holding the... I'm holding it like this. It's doing a Naruto run. Alright. 15 seconds.
[3868.15s -> 3889.61s]  Here it comes. It's gonna go... I just got achievement. It says meta gamer. This one's
[3889.61s -> 3907.26s]  out of order. Okay. Well, that was cool. Make your room darker. No. I can't make my room darker.
[3907.26s -> 3915.58s]  Same reason why I can't go see a movie during the day. When... If I black out these... The curtains
[3915.58s -> 3920.86s]  and I turn all the lights off. My... It's nighttime to me. I don't like going to see a movie during
[3920.86s -> 3923.82s]  the day when you go into this theater and it's like, oh, it's so dark in here. It's... There's
[3923.82s -> 3930.22s]  the big screen. Oh, big... And then you walk out and it's like... Sun is out and... Oh, I was just
[3930.22s -> 3936.22s]  sitting in a pitch black room for like two and a half hours. No. I don't see movies during the day.
[3936.78s -> 3951.93s]  A movie is like a... After dinner, you go out to dinner and then like a seven to nine p.m. showing
[3951.93s -> 3966.12s]  is perfect. Now, there are scenarios where going to a movie during the day is not a bad idea because
[3966.12s -> 3971.00s]  sometimes you save money. You know, if you go to like a noon showing, sometimes the tickets are
[3971.00s -> 3976.44s]  cheaper. Do they still do that or... I've been to one movie in two years or two movies in three years.
[3976.44s -> 3985.78s]  Do they still do like seven dollar matinees? Okay. I'm just making sure. Well, there's something new.
[3986.42s -> 4015.67s]  Is that supposed to be me? Like my brain stuck in this simulation? Put furniture pads on your
[4015.67s -> 4021.37s]  furniture, please, guys. Don't be like this fucking idiot here. Those floors are expensive. Don't
[4021.37s -> 4028.49s]  ruin them. This place is finally starting to affect me. I've seen enough horror movies to
[4028.49s -> 4032.73s]  know how to survive a simple ghost or two, but these monsters keep getting faster and stranger.
[4033.29s -> 4051.90s]  Almost at 250. And I have not died yet. I swear, man. I have to do a cross-eyed thing.
[4053.70s -> 4059.46s]  My eyes hurt. My mother warned me so many times. Don't do that. If you do it long enough,
[4059.46s -> 4087.86s]  it's gonna stay like that. Not this again. Left, left, straight, left, left, straight, straight.
[4088.50s -> 4099.30s]  If I was a puzzle designer, that's exactly what I would have done for the second one.
[4099.86s -> 4104.66s]  In fact, I would do straight, straight, straight, straight, straight, and then just really mess it
[4104.66s -> 4123.78s]  all up. That's the sound. I haven't seen anything major in a little while, so
[4124.34s -> 4149.16s]  don't do it. Don't, don't, don't. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Stop it.
[4149.80s -> 4177.69s]  Stop doing that. Five nights at Freddy's. Don't look directly. Don't look directly into the fan.
[4178.41s -> 4204.22s]  Hello. Oh, it's your first day. Hello. All right. I tried to look. I looked directly into that fan.
[4207.77s -> 4212.49s]  What just happened right there? I just, I had to do the, the, the hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
[4212.49s -> 4232.76s]  Hello. I'm doing it again. I just got like stuck. 50. Oh. Hello.
[4239.70s -> 4262.65s]  Just keep going. Should I take, should I take the gift? Should I take the gift from
[4263.82s -> 4279.78s]  a third of all Twitter avatars? What do you think? I can save first.
[4314.54s -> 4325.99s]  That was funny. That was cute. I'm gonna retweet that. That was fun. Password is pumpkin.
[4325.99s -> 4379.11s]  Pumpkin. For what? We're good? Oh, this is bad.
[4379.11s -> 4407.11s]  That was another thing. No, Jeremy, you're bad. Oh shit. There's something else. Nice turtleneck.
[4411.48s -> 4422.98s]  Right. It was wrong. It was wrong. It was wrong. It's all right. I made it with just a little
[4422.98s -> 4455.30s]  scratch. What's up tonight? What's going on here? Jeremy, Jeremy, you're almost at 300.
[4456.76s -> 4460.12s]  You idiot. That's a face I just made into the camera.
[4471.58s -> 4479.37s]  Wow. It's that one worse than anything. Come on. You're almost at 300.
[4497.16s -> 4502.20s]  This music is just messing me up. It just feels like I don't want to, I don't want to hear this.
[4503.72s -> 4508.20s]  I want Yoshi's Story OST to play in the background of my streams.
[4535.13s -> 4540.15s]  Why is everyone talking about my neck? Leave me alone. What's wrong with my neck?
[4540.31s -> 4550.57s]  My neck? I'm 34. I'm not like 20. You understand? This isn't what a real neck looks like at 35.
[4551.13s -> 4565.98s]  What do I care? But what do you guys have to say? I'm almost at 300.
[4587.38s -> 4600.38s]  He's 35 and he still gets voice cracks. That doesn't even bother me. Yeah, guess what? My
[4600.38s -> 4605.90s]  teacher. I told teachers in high school that their voice would crack because they were speaking
[4605.90s -> 4612.30s]  continuously for like six hours. And at hour number five, they'd be like, and I, uh, you guys,
[4612.30s -> 4626.12s]  sorry guys, I'm a teacher. That's cope. I'm giving you guys way too many like screenshots.
[4631.06s -> 4635.54s]  Sometimes I forget that like you could just rewind five seconds and stop at a single frame
[4635.54s -> 4655.99s]  and press a button. What? It's got to go faster than chair, not chair route.
[4666.54s -> 4678.92s]  Ah, this is making me sick. Did he fall off? I think he fell off the edge. Oh, no, he didn't.
[4679.56s -> 4727.21s]  His power stopped. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, 300. Anything I need to know?
[4728.09s -> 4733.74s]  Anything I need to know? That anyone's just saying anything? Somebody to know.
[4741.24s -> 4757.88s]  You're doing good. Thanks. There's somebody behind you. No, it's not. I mean, it was that.
[4758.36s -> 4764.25s]  Better ingredients, better pasta. That's the power of Home Depot. Papa John's thing.
[4764.81s -> 4782.34s]  That's Papa John's. I don't like that pizza. Is that so wrong to say I don't like that pizza?
[4783.30s -> 4818.94s]  My religious man. Um, not really. He's a, he's Mormon. Where are you getting the idea that I'm
[4818.94s -> 4828.66s]  Mormon? Yeah. Oh shit. Okay. This is where it gets real at 300.
[4829.62s -> 4853.18s]  This is a good game to stream. Yeah, I'm having a good time. As much as you can have a good time,
[4853.18s -> 4872.68s]  just having things yell at you every so often. Yeah, that's been a minute or two.
[4873.72s -> 4904.79s]  This reminds me of Dreadhalls. So I can like go into these too. Nice. Sick. Sick Windows 95
[4904.79s -> 4928.46s]  adventure game music. Blasted. It's perfect. Now bring back the like the dunks and I just,
[4928.46s -> 4935.98s]  am I reading this out of order? One day a strange merchant came to town. He sold handmade puppets
[4935.98s -> 4941.34s]  and trinkets and all the children loved his store and his gifts. But the town couldn't support his
[4941.34s -> 4946.78s]  store because the other shops were failing. The other shopkeepers became jealous. So one night,
[4946.78s -> 4957.27s]  some of the town's people took all his puppets and threw them in the river. But just afterwards,
[4957.27s -> 4961.03s]  he came running to the river crying and wailing that his children were being drowned.
[4961.75s -> 4966.14s]  He dove into the river trying to save his possessions. The townspeople, bitter and still
[4966.14s -> 4970.30s]  angry, watched him frantically thrash and dive into the river until he never came back to the
[4970.30s -> 4998.49s]  surface of the water. That's a huge key. I thought the key was a pair of scissors. That's where it
[4998.49s -> 5046.57s]  came from. Use the key. How many stars do I have? That was slow to get up. Somebody in here. Although
[5046.57s -> 5053.45s]  not what they wanted, the shopkeepers were satisfied. Years later, the children of the
[5053.45s -> 5058.09s]  town began to go missing. And as more and more children disappeared, people began to find more
[5058.09s -> 5062.41s]  and more puppets in the forest and around the river. These puppets seemed almost to look like
[5062.41s -> 5091.82s]  the missing children sometimes. Open door. This door looks different than all the others. Why?
[5092.70s -> 5114.33s]  Okay. All right. So it teleports. Hey! I'm dead. I'm dead.
[5144.60s -> 5171.61s]  No! No! No, I can't do eye shit. I can't do eye shit. I can't. I can't. I can't do eye shit.
[5172.65s -> 5181.78s]  Harshness of choice. Now nothing you do is your fault. Now you belong to something. You belong to me.
[5181.78s -> 5204.58s]  Game over. Your soul wanders an endless maze. I think I just heard like my dog bark.
[5205.94s -> 5213.32s]  Hold on. I think he's like, maybe he wants to go in a room or something. Give me one second. He's
[5213.32s -> 5334.39s]  like, hey, come get me. I don't know. He just kind of was, he's eaten. He ate today. He's gone out
[5334.39s -> 5341.82s]  today. I think he was just annoyed with me that I wasn't playing with him. He was just like,
[5342.70s -> 5351.32s]  what are you doing? I was like, why are you in there? I said, hello.
[5351.32s -> 5356.78s]  And we'll see. We'll see what he does. Play with him. I just did. I played with him with a toy
[5357.34s -> 5377.32s]  and I gave him a snack. So he's good. Show auto. On my next BRB, because he's like awake. So
[5378.12s -> 5387.62s]  when I leave, I'll go bring him in here. You can say hello. No, not now. Not right now. In a little
[5387.62s -> 5409.43s]  bit. All right. So this guy, I have to run as fast as I can. I have to do this dumb stuff again.
[5409.43s -> 5438.06s]  Get the key and open the door and 305, 306, 307, 308, three. It's not the same. This is different.
[5438.06s -> 5462.74s]  Wait, why is this different? There's another cat dos. Physical punctures. A wooden life-size
[5462.74s -> 5468.28s]  puppet found floating in a reservoir where a town had once been. Specimen is active despite
[5468.28s -> 5472.84s]  appearance and has proved very effective on subjects who disregard it or have vision
[5472.84s -> 5491.77s]  impairments. Disregard it? Disregard it. So I get it. I don't know what that is. Like a painting.
[5491.77s -> 5499.37s]  Specimen is constantly changing form and attributes depending on subject's personality.
[5499.37s -> 5505.61s]  The most common form resembles a wall of moving anatomy symbols. Only effective on subjects with
[5505.61s -> 5515.27s]  past trauma or a history of psychological issues. Okay. Floating figure that appeared in a test
[5515.27s -> 5520.39s]  chamber a few years after it was filled with what was believed to just be unusually violent
[5520.39s -> 5525.16s]  deer. Specimen seems to engulf subjects and absorb them into its torso region,
[5525.16s -> 5547.21s]  proved extremely effective on violent subjects. So don't attack this one. Exit program. Here it is.
[5548.87s -> 5558.71s]  You'll get the key. Puppets. Watch out for the puppets. This person used, this person was a
[5558.71s -> 5562.79s]  puppet. And they are now. They used to be a person, but now they're a puppet.
[5563.51s -> 5571.82s]  So watch out and look at them because he's, he gives reactions to people that do not care about
[5571.82s -> 5607.30s]  them. The hell did I just do? Key. All right. Let's try this again. Do I kind of like level up my
[5607.30s -> 5639.26s]  stamina bar? All right. So I, he gets mad if you don't pay attention to it. Whoa. His eyes just got
[5639.26s -> 5652.55s]  angry. Oh, he's angry. That's actually pretty scary. Where, where, where, where, where, where,
[5652.55s -> 5694.23s]  where? Oh, where, where is he? I hate that face. It's fucking horrifying. I'll go to the chair
[5694.23s -> 5720.74s]  route. I did it. He's gone. Nice. He's not still here, right? Okay. On to three 50.
[5721.38s -> 5752.25s]  I'm seeing this brain room again. That dude's coming back. That dude's coming back. I'm certain
[5752.25s -> 5758.04s]  of it. He's going to just appear in front of me and I'm going to have to run away and turn around
[5758.04s -> 5797.42s]  or something. Yup. I knew it. I knew it. Oh, it's this, it's this lady. Okay. Oh, he instantly died.
[5805.70s -> 5817.00s]  Find out. I'm not going to find out because I looked over at chat. I thought, I don't know,
[5817.00s -> 5834.41s]  I thought that was like one of you guys coming at me. Where's my checkpoint? Oh, that's not good.
[5834.41s -> 5842.60s]  You get a checkpoint every hundred now. Of course. Why would it be any video games?
[5843.40s -> 5863.66s]  I've played these already. Jeremy, could you please keep it down? I've had a horrible cold
[5863.66s -> 5889.42s]  the last few days. I need to rest. Go take a bath. What are you doing here? Go season your bathtub
[5889.42s -> 5935.14s]  with epsom salt and make it hot enough where it's, it's our, oh, it's silent. No,
[5936.02s -> 5971.19s]  figure it out. Watch this. How do I get out of here? You got to do a backwards long jump. Yeah.
[5971.19s -> 5997.94s]  What am I thinking? I have to go and fly through the fucking ball. Pay attention. That's just on
[5997.94s -> 6027.69s]  the wall now. What does that mean? That actually just scared me. That was like a scary thing.
[6028.57s -> 6082.33s]  Stop. It's like sticking your beds on the wall. What's that? Sick. Ah, it's back. He's back. He's
[6082.33s -> 6102.30s]  back. Um, oh fuck. Which way is it? Is it left or right? This guy, I hate this guy. He's fucking
[6102.30s -> 6134.02s]  horrible. I have to go left. It's a goddamn chair route. Don't die. Please don't die here.
[6134.02s -> 6174.33s]  You motherfucker. You motherfucker. Get away from me. Oh my God. Oh my God. I have, how many more
[6174.33s -> 6211.35s]  from this is it? Oh shit. God. That guy's scary. This is face. When that guy gets close to you,
[6211.35s -> 6236.30s]  he does that face and it's just horrible. Don't die now chair. He's close though.
[6239.35s -> 6273.98s]  Right this time. Right this time. Another one of these. Why? Okay. Always left.
[6277.13s -> 6309.93s]  It's left every time. Except I did left before and it wasn't during the puppet guy. 400. Bingo.
[6309.93s -> 6332.39s]  We got it. Yes. Yes. Keep that blood pumping. GL Labs. 40%. Pretty cool. Anything else,
[6332.39s -> 6357.02s]  anything I need to know. So there's an image. Let's see what it is. I got a nice clean tongue.
[6357.18s -> 6365.24s]  Auto. No, I'm auto. I'm not going to get auto right now. I'm going to get auto at my break.
[6365.24s -> 6370.44s]  I'm not going to need to go get auto. He's doing just fine. I'll get him at my next break.
[6371.24s -> 6375.75s]  And then he's probably going to just hang out in here for a minute. I don't want auto in here,
[6375.75s -> 6380.39s]  by the way, because, oh, yeah. Let me, let me put, let me put my dog in the room and,
[6380.39s -> 6385.83s]  oh, hey guys, there's a little bed for you right here. And every 45 seconds,
[6385.83s -> 6393.10s]  he's going to be like, what the? I don't want to do that. That's like, I'm just be scaring him.
[6393.66s -> 6405.90s]  He scared me. Yeah. And imagine if you were a dog that was like sleeping over here, lying down.
[6407.02s -> 6411.02s]  Imagine you, imagine if you were sleeping and you've heard that. All right. I gotta pay attention.
[6411.66s -> 6431.46s]  It's the brain again. Scalp is itchy again. Just happens. I thought they got rid of you.
[6431.46s -> 6434.58s]  I thought they got rid of you things. I thought you didn't do that anymore. I don't,
[6434.58s -> 6451.67s]  I didn't think they did that anymore after floor 300. Why are some of these doors locked?
[6454.17s -> 6492.57s]  Threshold of consciousness. Oh, it's a cat. That's all it was.
[6505.59s -> 6529.40s]  It's like a test of endurance. This game is a test of endurance
[6530.81s -> 6547.99s]  to see if you can get to floor 1000. Oh, that's, I just was over there. Don't touch them.
[6550.47s -> 6573.67s]  I have to pick a side. Strawberry or vanilla. Oh, this is tough. Strawberry. Strawberry ice cream is,
[6574.55s -> 6581.03s]  wait, this is important. Strawberry ice cream is terrible if it has strawberry chunks in it.
[6581.67s -> 6587.19s]  But if it's a smooth strawberry ice cream, no bullshit, just smooth strawberry flavor,
[6587.75s -> 6592.31s]  that's the best ice cream you can possibly buy. That's just a regular ice cream. Vanilla on the
[6592.31s -> 6597.59s]  other hand, it's, this looks like vanilla bean. So that, this is, okay, so we have smooth
[6598.47s -> 6604.97s]  strawberry ice cream and vanilla bean ice cream. That makes this a lot harder because vanilla bean
[6604.97s -> 6612.42s]  ice cream is way better. I think I would still want the strawberry, smooth strawberry. Yeah,
[6612.42s -> 6635.14s]  I'm staying with the smooth strawberry ice cream. How do I say yes? I don't think it does anything.
[6635.78s -> 6643.74s]  Does that floor look smooth to you? It's pixelated. That's, this floor is pixelated too.
[6644.70s -> 6673.54s]  Should I touch all this stuff? All right, well, whatever. I chose mint chocolate. No, pistachio
[6673.54s -> 6682.25s]  without pistachios. One of the best ice creams is pistachio ice cream. What without, I just spit
[6682.25s -> 6687.70s]  them out. See me and, me and Kim, we do this thing where when I get pistachio ice cream,
[6687.70s -> 6693.54s]  I just eat the ice cream and then I, I spit out the pistachios and then she eats them.
[6694.90s -> 6706.07s]  That's not weird. I eat, well, look, let me tell you, I eat around the pistachios and then like,
[6706.07s -> 6713.54s]  they just, I just don't eat them. I will save big chunks of ice cream with pistachios in them
[6714.18s -> 6718.74s]  and I make a little corner that's like, that's for Kim because she likes, she loves pistachios.
[6718.74s -> 6723.14s]  So I make, there's like 12 pistachios just sitting in the corner with like ice cream around them and
[6723.14s -> 6735.18s]  she just eats them. I don't like, I mean, I don't like spit them out, Mr. Q. That's disgusting.
[6735.90s -> 6762.58s]  Yeah, just, telephones are ringing. Telephones are ringing. Ah, become, follow the group.
[6764.78s -> 6780.41s]  Free come more than yourself. Be who you are. Follow the group. That's what it says. Be who you
[6780.41s -> 6787.53s]  are to others. Oh, the dev is not a three. I thought it was like a three. How did I see
[6787.53s -> 6797.40s]  that differently? I saw three E. It was fucked up. No, it was fucked up. See the backgrounds changing
[6797.40s -> 6801.80s]  behind this sometimes. It actually, clip it and look at it. You'll see what I'm talking about.
[6801.80s -> 6812.47s]  Trust me. Also, butter pecan ice cream falls in this category as well. Butter pecan ice cream is
[6812.47s -> 6818.55s]  absolutely delicious, but get those pecans out of there. The actual butter pecan flavored
[6818.55s -> 6826.84s]  ice cream is incredible. I just want to buy just the ice cream. Why is that so strange?
[6829.99s -> 6832.71s]  And then they decided they were going to come up with something called butter crunch
[6833.80s -> 6843.59s]  and it's that butter pecan ice cream. What's happening? It's the bugs. Okay.
[6843.59s -> 6850.41s]  Okay. Butter pecan ice cream turns into butter crunch and then they turn the pecans
[6851.05s -> 6857.93s]  instead of pecans. It's now these chunky, crunchy, buttery, tasty, sweet things. And that's all right.
[6857.93s -> 6862.17s]  That's a step in the right direction, but you need to go full blown only butter
[6862.17s -> 6905.30s]  flavored ice cream. The butter pecan flavored ice cream. That's blood. Knowing your shadow can
[6905.30s -> 6914.47s]  greatly help you, but be ready to see what you'd rather not be. Knowing your shadow. Watch out for
[6914.47s -> 6943.22s]  your shadow. It was scary until you added the Mario sounds. What is that? What the fuck is that?
[6943.22s -> 6947.14s]  What was, what is that? What's that thing? What do I do about the, oh, it's the wall guy.
[6948.18s -> 6951.62s]  It's the wall guy. And now the Indiana Jones river is flying over here.
[6952.26s -> 6968.30s]  What do I do with wall person? Do I step? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What do I do
[6968.30s -> 6979.27s]  with the wall? I just heard auto again. All right. Hold on. I have to like, let me, let me go try to
[6979.27s -> 7000.52s]  like see if he wants to go out. I'm going to take like a few minute break here. Oh shit. Uh oh.
[7001.08s -> 7009.22s]  This is like a countdown. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. I got, I've got to
[7009.22s -> 7017.16s]  go see, I've got to go take out a lot. I'll be right back again. Sorry. I need to see what,
[7017.16s -> 7022.92s]  I need to see what Otto needs. I don't think he's hungry. I think he's been fed. All right.
[7022.92s -> 7373.37s]  I'll be right back. Let me see what's going on. Okay. I'm returned. Uh, he had to take a big dump.
[7374.33s -> 7386.26s]  That's what happened. And he didn't want to come upstairs with me. He was like running around. He
[7386.26s -> 7392.18s]  didn't, he took, he did with that thing where he took a big dog poop and he was just so happy
[7392.18s -> 7397.06s]  to have taken that dog poop that he was just like, everything is great now. And he just
[7397.06s -> 7413.11s]  sprinting around. He didn't want to come up here. You'll see him today. Later. Not there. I don't
[7413.11s -> 7420.89s]  want that. That's not, I don't want to bring him up here during the scream game because what,
[7420.89s -> 7425.99s]  because once I bring him up here, you know, he's in the room and he's hanging out and he's like,
[7425.99s -> 7429.19s]  it's all right. All right. Now you're out of here. It's like, well, I, you just brought me in here
[7429.19s -> 7437.38s]  to hang out with you. Sorry. I don't want to scream and have you hear my screaming while you're
[7437.38s -> 7445.82s]  trying to sleep. Bring him up during the outro. Yeah, I know you'll see him. You'll see him later.
[7445.82s -> 7458.57s]  You will see Otto on this stream or I'll do a 24 hour stream. By the time this stream turns off,
[7458.57s -> 7474.36s]  you will see Otto. All right. That was left, left, right, straight, left, right, left, right.
[7475.00s -> 7493.64s]  See, I'm a puzzle master. That's how I knew how to do that. All right. Don't, I don't want to get
[7493.64s -> 7502.97s]  cocky or anything because it really is, it's every hundred floors, rooms, whatever. I forgot
[7502.97s -> 7525.83s]  to apply my lip balm. Balm streamer. Yeah. Somebody said you have dry ass lips and I was like,
[7526.55s -> 7531.06s]  fucking I'll fix it. I get dry lips, especially out here in Vegas.
[7531.06s -> 7569.66s]  Vegas. Yeah. I live in Las Vegas now. Yes, I do. Really? This whole time I've just been
[7569.66s -> 7582.50s]  living in Massachusetts. I think this room, last time something jumped out there.
[7584.44s -> 7605.48s]  Oh, it's the, it's the girl. Where? Why am I? I'm going back. Oh, my head. That just like short
[7605.56s -> 7660.60s]  circuited. Oh no. Where's this exit? Am I insane? Why are you still here? It's going to be the puppet
[7660.60s -> 7669.80s]  guy again. I knew it, right? What's that thing? What's that mean? That's new. That's new. That's
[7669.80s -> 7683.08s]  a new sound. What's the cardboard? Oh, there was the cardboard did late. It screwed up.
[7692.73s -> 7706.82s]  This thing, their cues all the time. What's that one? This means something, right? Oh, it's a bug.
[7707.78s -> 7723.85s]  Okay. Anytime you hear the, it's the big caterpillar. Get out of the way, coffee.
[7725.53s -> 7759.32s]  Okay. I'm good. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. What is this? What is that?
[7761.80s -> 7773.06s]  Oh, it's this thing that makes everything all weird. Oh shit. Okay. They're almost there.
[7773.06s -> 7787.78s]  Almost there. Almost there. Almost there. 484. Not going to happen anymore. You're not going to get
[7787.78s -> 7803.78s]  me, but it's like 15 times you've gotten me. Not going to happen again. Am I good? I'm good. All
[7803.78s -> 7841.10s]  right. Thank God. Halfway point coming up. Little shit. Didn't get it. Okay. I'm good. Go back. Go
[7841.10s -> 7847.22s]  back. You don't go back in this game. You only go forward. Can you fall off the edge?
[7847.86s -> 7862.50s]  I don't want to test that. I'm so glad nothing's following me. Table ending.
[7873.08s -> 7875.96s]  Jeremy, I'm trying to catch up with you playing Darkwood and you're streaming again.
[7876.84s -> 7886.26s]  Hey, what's up? And we're streaming tomorrow, too. You'll be happy to know that tomorrow is
[7886.26s -> 7903.26s]  Darkwood again. A va de friends. Give me that. 500. Password is.
[7903.74s -> 7915.00s]  Well, here you are. Still here. Next door is going to fix up for you. So enjoy and keep moving on.
[7919.70s -> 7927.38s]  So pumpkin cheese. Next one's going to be cake and the next one's going to be
[7927.38s -> 7936.02s]  latte. At the last floor. Why can I not save the game? There we go.
[7937.14s -> 7947.48s]  Pumpkin cheese. 500 rovers. I saved it. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. So this one's out of order
[7947.48s -> 7951.72s]  and this one's not out of order. I mean, you go to the one that's out of order.
[7960.71s -> 7997.27s]  Never mind. Let's go halfway there. Why is this 52? I don't know if this means anything,
[7997.83s -> 8001.35s]  but I just got logged in and I got logged out and logged in on Steam.
[8019.51s -> 8034.55s]  Save corrupted. Room 53. No, this is scripted. This is scripted. This is scripted. I'm going to
[8034.55s -> 8044.41s]  get to like floor 100 and it's going to be, it's going to be like, oh, you made it. Why'd you go
[8044.41s -> 8049.53s]  that way? Now walk into this portal. The cat's going to come back and I'm going to go to like
[8049.53s -> 8063.70s]  portal and go to five, like 50. That's definitely how this is going to work. He's lost it.
[8066.23s -> 8067.59s]  Yeah, this is a different room too.
[8069.91s -> 8090.10s]  MonkaS. Can you only talk in the auto voice till you get to floor 100? Yeah.
[8125.21s -> 8146.89s]  Edward002313BFBGEL. Cannot release twice. Exit through express. I told you guys this
[8146.89s -> 8179.42s]  wouldn't happen. You didn't get to 100. I got to 100 five times. That's 500.
[8184.65s -> 8188.50s]  You got to hear it. Good. Good.
[8190.41s -> 8239.02s]  Good. Good. Bugs. Bugs. Bugs. Good. Good bugs. All right. God. Open. Yeah. I don't even, I don't,
[8239.02s -> 8242.78s]  they just get me because they're just annoying. They just get in the way.
[8242.78s -> 8245.02s]  And of course I have to react because I have to get out of the way.
[8245.82s -> 8264.20s]  531. All right. I can't fucking do that right now. I'm trying.
[8265.32s -> 8267.24s]  My, both my ears are blocked. I can't do anything.
[8283.34s -> 8286.46s]  That's yeah, that's the bank of fucking America. What about it?
[8300.97s -> 8310.22s]  This is new music. What is that? I don't know what this new music means, but I have to move.
[8312.10s -> 8327.62s]  Don't attack the one. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Preparing for it. Whatever it is.
[8333.42s -> 8341.72s]  Okay. We're outside. There's a cabin. For a while, I thought I had really escaped this place,
[8341.72s -> 8346.60s]  but despite the trees and flora, I think this is actually just another room.
[8347.40s -> 8356.06s]  I did hope to find deer, so I might at least get to eat and make some strange sounds though.
[8356.06s -> 8368.70s]  This is the deer enemy, which I was told do not attack the deer enemy. Don't attack the
[8370.30s -> 8381.00s]  What the fuck is wrong with you? I don't know what they are, but those are definitely not deer.
[8381.00s -> 8385.38s]  No shit. I tried sneaking up on one the other day to kill for food,
[8385.38s -> 8389.99s]  but it saw me as soon as I got close. I was barely able to get away from the thing.
[8389.99s -> 8396.63s]  I've managed to board up most of them. Hopefully I can find another way out of here.
[8396.63s -> 8417.99s]  Don't get, don't get near them. Do not go near them. I thought I said don't attack them.
[8442.31s -> 8471.94s]  What? We're inside of a computer. They don't follow you into rooms, right? I hate this music.
[8471.94s -> 8498.95s]  It's like an untuned piano underwater. What the fuck are you? Hi, what's happening? How are you?
[8498.95s -> 8503.80s]  Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who is that person?
[8503.96s -> 8522.49s]  Oh, no, no. It's the person that runs in front of you. I don't know what that means.
[8522.49s -> 8584.49s]  What does it say? Is it a Borg? Toast. It's the guy. It's the guy. Oh, no. This was the worst.
[8584.49s -> 8590.49s]  This was worse. This spit on me. This spit all over my mouth. This is blood. I can't tell.
[8590.49s -> 8624.52s]  I have like a big spit wad on my mouth. You need to get your submission
[8624.68s -> 8649.51s]  is forfeit to me. I will devour your flesh. That guy wasn't as scary as this guy. What?
[8649.51s -> 8700.94s]  I need that heal. Let's go. You did it. You actually, you did it. You did it. Hello. You
[8700.94s -> 8705.98s]  were at, you did it. You did the thing. You did it. You did it. I didn't do it. You did it.
[8705.98s -> 8711.21s]  You actually did it. I knew it. Break the fan. Don't look in the fan. I've been
[8718.10s -> 8745.48s]  600 Romans. It's 60% of the way through this. 600. Oh, dude. Oh, pog, dude.
[8746.60s -> 8794.86s]  Pog. All right. This is Pillar. Make like a tree and die coming this fall. Interesting. I still
[8794.86s -> 8804.30s]  have the axe, right? That comes with me. What are most of those never-ending hallways that I
[8804.30s -> 8828.47s]  came across? Don't hurt them. Well, what are they doing? If a guy's running down a hallway with an
[8828.47s -> 8839.96s]  axe, I don't think it's smart to jump out in front of them and yell. I would stay closed. I would
[8839.96s -> 8849.02s]  not open. Especially if the person was like panicking. Oh, shit. You don't want to start
[8849.02s -> 8860.55s]  off a panicking guy with the axe. That's just, that seems like common sense. Oh, this is not
[8860.55s -> 8885.02s]  good. I don't know where I'm going. Oh, that doesn't work. This whole place is somehow even
[8885.02s -> 8889.98s]  worse than the new GL labs. Although it seems to have been constructed with a much larger budget
[8889.98s -> 8894.78s]  than the new lab, nothing works quite right. I can see why it was abandoned so quickly.
[8895.58s -> 8903.98s]  I wonder if there really is anything here worth salvaging. Reset.
[8903.98s -> 8931.42s]  Reset. Power's back on. Go this way.
[8934.38s -> 8982.07s]  This is loud. This is very loud. Make it louder. I don't, you don't want this to be louder. This,
[8982.07s -> 8990.47s]  not this, not this, not a vent. Not a vent. The easiest horror game environment is the vent.
[8991.43s -> 9019.90s]  And it is the most effective. It's the goddamn vent. Spooky just said that there were things
[9019.90s -> 9025.42s]  we needed to salvage from this place. I'm starting to worry that a loose specimen may be included in
[9025.42s -> 9030.94s]  the list of things for us to retrieve. The power just shut off again. Is everything broken in here?
[9058.18s -> 9065.13s]  I don't know what to do. I can't think while I feel strange. I'm hiding from that thing.
[9065.77s -> 9071.29s]  I feel like something is growing on my skin. I can't seem to tear it off fast enough. I'm
[9071.29s -> 9083.85s]  losing a lot of blood. That thing. Can I please go in a different room now? Oh.
[9086.33s -> 9090.90s]  You have to keep it close. It becomes something else when it gets too far away.
[9090.90s -> 9099.69s]  Something I can't outrun. I'll, I'll give it a try. I'm going to give it a try.
[9101.29s -> 9125.83s]  Stay close. Get over here. Stay near me. It hurts. Hey, it said keep the thing close.
[9125.83s -> 9154.30s]  It's turned into an animal. Jump scares always distance 242. What does that mean?
[9159.08s -> 9175.54s]  Okay, so I need to keep it close. I can't kill it. So just back around. Why am I wearing two
[9175.54s -> 9181.14s]  headphones? You monster. Well, because if I have one headphone and I can't hear them come around
[9181.14s -> 9186.10s]  corners, and it is a horror game and there is a face cam on, so I might as well really, really go
[9186.10s -> 9234.55s]  for it. 604. Shit. Keep it close. Here we are. 607. 608. What? 609. Wait, what's that sound? I
[9234.55s -> 9248.31s]  forget. This is it. Okay, I made it. All right. All right. So just keep it close. Just back away.
[9249.75s -> 9263.80s]  Turn off my lights in my room. No, I'm not going to the movies. I'm not going to the movies during
[9263.80s -> 9297.50s]  the day. Lights off, you're a coward. During the day. Okay, here we go. This is all just for show.
[9297.50s -> 9329.77s]  Nothing happens in here. Stay close, but not too close. Yes. This is it.
[9332.97s -> 9357.61s]  Where's the fucking door? Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Let's go.
[9358.17s -> 9399.91s]  Hi. Where's the door? Where's the door? Right here. I want you to look at me.
[9401.67s -> 9432.14s]  Look at me. What's my range? I'm not very good. I wonder what happens if I sprint around the
[9432.14s -> 9449.11s]  circle, but I don't want to lose. I want to find out. Is it getting faster? Come on. Come here.
[9451.62s -> 9467.82s]  How long is this going to go on for? Still following me.
[9493.05s -> 9507.67s]  Oh, this guy sucks. How far is too far? I wonder. Watch the door. You're doing an escort mission.
[9507.67s -> 9527.22s]  Yeah, that's what it feels like. All right. The scare factor on this dude is gone.
[9527.22s -> 9555.22s]  No, you're just kind of sad. What the fuck was that? He's gone. What was that? You are here.
[9555.22s -> 9577.83s]  622. Who is it? What is that? It's you again. I thought we were done with this. Not for another
[9578.71s -> 9599.27s]  20 rooms, apparently. Just ditch him. Just ditch him. But it said that if I go too far away,
[9599.27s -> 9602.07s]  he'll turn into something that it's impossible for me to run away from.
[9602.79s -> 9626.28s]  To wait for you. No, I'm not going to ditch him. I don't even know where the hell I'm going though.
[9632.28s -> 9656.60s]  How far is too far though, I wonder. Let him grab your butt. Do it. I'm not going to do that.
[9656.60s -> 9680.65s]  But what if he kills you instantly? Going this way. It's going to be a pop-up thing.
[9684.97s -> 9694.70s]  Come on. You're slowing me down. I did so many rooms so fast. Now I have to do it like this.
[9695.58s -> 9722.71s]  Let's go. Needed a few extra punches there. Getting tired. Snorlax, whatever his name is.
[9722.71s -> 9741.98s]  What am I doing? No, I guess that makes sense. What's the thing from Star Wars that eats the
[9741.98s -> 9754.86s]  people? It looks like that big circle. The Snorlax. I said you're looking tired. I didn't mean
[9754.86s -> 9764.87s]  like Snorlax tired. I meant like Sarlacc pit. That's just what I called him. I didn't mean to
[9764.87s -> 9781.56s]  make that be actually like Snorlax. Guys, I'm bored and I have to walk with this toddler back
[9781.56s -> 9816.31s]  here. Thank god. Not that way. You dare. No, you dare come in one of these rooms.
[9826.47s -> 9833.10s]  Where that monster is going to be a pain in the ass is when I don't know what's about to happen
[9833.10s -> 9840.46s]  and it happens and I'm just running. That's going to be bad. He's closed when he first comes
[9840.46s -> 9861.90s]  in a room and then he opens. So that's what he looks like. 640. Getting there. Dev in chat. Dev
[9861.90s -> 9882.17s]  in chat. What's up? What's going on? I wonder what happens when I get to a thousand. They spread him
[9882.17s -> 9886.97s]  out far enough that you just forget that it's even possible. All right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[9887.61s -> 9908.01s]  In order to survive this house, I need to keep writing notes. I must do everything a central
[9908.01s -> 9914.18s]  protagonist would and hope this is one of those stories. Insert obscure horror reference that
[9914.18s -> 9932.44s]  no one gets and misinterprets as instructions somehow. It's me. It's me writing those notes.
[9933.24s -> 9940.86s]  I'm just getting weirder and weirder as I go. Come on. Come on. You don't think you try to make
[9940.86s -> 9944.38s]  yourself laugh when you came around the corner for like a hundredth time. I don't know what this
[9944.38s -> 9964.33s]  means. Oh, it's just the your flesh will be mine. Oh, I this is this is such a this is that the
[9964.33s -> 9970.58s]  person runs in front of you. Here we go. They remember this. You have to go around like three or
[9970.58s -> 10008.55s]  four times. Sprints and screams at the screen like right now. I missed it. Good. I didn't see it.
[10009.27s -> 10027.62s]  There wasn't even any music. Their music usually starts. They have a whole song. They have a
[10027.62s -> 10047.45s]  soundtrack for these monsters. Clicking. Is that what it is? He's right behind me.
[10073.48s -> 10084.50s]  What? Oh, isn't this the that's not the music for the I thought that was the music.
[10085.30s -> 10087.22s]  No, I don't have I can't do it. I have to run.
[10088.66s -> 10093.22s]  Time to sprint sprint. Go. Go. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna get hurt. It's okay. I can take a few hits.
[10102.58s -> 10114.22s]  Almost 700.
[10125.18s -> 10132.10s]  Those can be attributed to somebody just sticking a fork into your back randomly. Like I know they're
[10132.10s -> 10137.70s]  in the room. Like if Kim was sitting behind me right now with a fork and every like 12 minutes
[10137.70s -> 10144.65s]  she just went like that. I'd be like it would scare me. It'll be like fucked up. I know you're
[10144.65s -> 10153.45s]  back there. I know you're gonna do it. But I don't know when or why. Why is everybody writing single
[10153.45s -> 10208.46s]  twos? Oh, no. It's dark. It was way too dark. Oh, that's horrible. I don't know where I am.
[10208.46s -> 10267.51s]  What the fuck is the door? That sucks. Pog. Hey, Pog. That's all I gotta say. That's all I gotta say.
[10268.41s -> 10279.05s]  Anyone notes? Wrong way. LOL Pog. You don't Pog after an LOL. Actually, yeah, maybe you can.
[10279.93s -> 10298.01s]  Depends on the scenario, I guess. Thankfully, no one's here. 700 coming up.
[10299.13s -> 10307.77s]  Just gotta make it to 700. Still don't understand what that's for.
[10319.13s -> 10323.32s]  Okay, don't fight it, right? Just run.
[10325.11s -> 10343.69s]  Your submission is- You! I keep cutting this guy off. He's just like,
[10343.69s -> 10386.49s]  I- You're- Because you're freaking me out. You don't say your submission is inevitable.
[10387.21s -> 10395.67s]  And then why are you running? Your submission is inevitable. I will devour you.
[10396.63s -> 10406.60s]  Why are you running away from me? Fuck off. Well, I still haven't died,
[10406.60s -> 10412.89s]  so it appears I might be the protagonist, but I'm not entirely sure. I hope I'm not some side
[10412.89s -> 10417.61s]  character that leaves notes for pointless exposition. Also, I found a strange computer
[10417.61s -> 10421.61s]  that gave descriptions of the monsters, and it seems like they are called effective based on how
[10421.61s -> 10469.30s]  many people they kill. Shit. Left. Right. Right. Right, left, right, left, right, left. Floor 700.
[10471.54s -> 10478.12s]  That much closer. Keep that blood pumping. All right, anything going on?
[10479.00s -> 10491.37s]  This is my time to interact with you guys. We only have 300 rooms left, yeah?
[10493.85s -> 10501.93s]  Auto. Get auto. I will be at the stream. I missed 666. I was being chased by a monster,
[10501.93s -> 10516.60s]  and I didn't want to go back to 600. All right, let's keep going. No, I said by the end of the
[10516.60s -> 10523.85s]  stream, if auto wasn't on it, then I would do a 24 hour stream. So, I just have to show auto
[10524.49s -> 10565.83s]  before I turn off the stream. 701. Let's go down. Notes.
[10572.47s -> 10577.30s]  I want to see the computer again. I feel like there's a few specimens I need to take a look
[10577.30s -> 10600.73s]  at that I don't know about. Restaurant? Taste the beef. 100% beef. What's on the menu? I can't read
[10600.73s -> 10620.98s]  that far. That looks like shit, actually. An old egg McMuffin. Fun rules. Okay, well, I need a key.
[10624.39s -> 10634.31s]  Behind the counter? One, I was anxious getting a job here at first, but it seems like things
[10634.31s -> 10639.43s]  are getting better. This chain is really expanding, which is a shock. Because just last week,
[10639.43s -> 10644.79s]  I heard this company was going broke. Every day, more and more people show up to eat here.
[10644.79s -> 10648.79s]  Something still sets me off about this place and its food, though. So, I'm going to try and not
[10648.79s -> 10669.13s]  eat anything from here. Into the freezer. Today was a weird day. The average number of orders
[10669.13s -> 10675.29s]  continues to rise as is, as it has been. But I don't know about the number of people. Today,
[10675.29s -> 10680.09s]  I saw someone else, someone use the drive-through and order a lot of food for one person. And then,
[10680.09s -> 10684.73s]  about 10 minutes later, they were back. They ordered the same exact meals, and then they left
[10684.73s -> 10689.37s]  again. Then after another 10 minutes, they were back again. Maybe they're just delivering food
[10689.37s -> 10693.77s]  for a party or hotel, but it worries me for some reason. I've done that plenty of times.
[10697.16s -> 10702.20s]  You guys have never done that before? You've never driven to Wendy's? You get two meals.
[10703.24s -> 10709.24s]  You finish both of them. You park. You just literally park your car and sit and eat in the
[10709.24s -> 10714.84s]  parking lot. And then you just want to make sure that you're still not hungry. So then you go back
[10714.84s -> 10721.88s]  and you get a soda or you get a frosty or something if you want. Or a small bacon cheeseburger. What
[10721.88s -> 10727.59s]  do they call it? The small ones. The ones that everyone loves. Junior bacon cheeseburger. Maybe
[10727.59s -> 10748.33s]  you want one more. That happens often. Why? What? Somebody was in here? Did I take too long? I took
[10748.33s -> 10761.80s]  too long in here. Thankfully, it's 700. I stood still for too long. Okay. Anyways, I've done that
[10761.80s -> 10782.55s]  before. Lost to Wendy's. Something like that. Wendy's Wheel. All right, let's go.
[10784.23s -> 10810.97s]  I want to get to 800 by three hours and 12 minutes. That's it. That was that was 12 minutes from
[10810.97s -> 10821.18s]  what I just said. Okay, into the restaurant. So I was in here. Can I go in any of the bathrooms?
[10826.46s -> 10831.02s]  Well, I broke my one rule today. The management doesn't give out actual lunch breaks.
[10831.02s -> 10835.66s]  So I can't go anywhere and they won't allow outside food here. I mean, they actually screamed
[10835.66s -> 10840.94s]  at the last customer who did that. Anyway, I had a burger. It wasn't bad and I don't feel sick. So
[10840.94s -> 10882.22s]  I might get a few every now and then. Got a key. It was in here. Yep. They're probably,
[10883.42s -> 10890.28s]  they're probably eating people. Yeah, this is a weird day. It worries me. Somebody came over here
[10890.28s -> 10912.86s]  and they ordered the same thing three times. Well, that's the way in. It's this one. This is
[10912.86s -> 10918.38s]  strange. I had a dream last night about this restaurant. I know I was here, but I also felt
[10918.38s -> 10924.78s]  like I was in another place at the same time. Everything looked so wrong. Nothing was the right
[10924.78s -> 10930.38s]  size. And I kept hearing these strange animal noises. Almost like wailing. I guess I just feel
[10930.38s -> 10935.34s]  guilty for eating that burger the other day. Also today I saw that man again, the one who kept
[10935.42s -> 10942.70s]  ordering every 10 minutes. This time he never even left the parking lot. Then he just got his meal
[10942.70s -> 10956.36s]  parked and then back in line. He must have done it at least eight times. He must be this tall.
[10956.92s -> 10961.32s]  No screams. Look out for snakes. No alcohol. No diving. No hiding. We will find you.
[10962.12s -> 10984.01s]  Laugh it up. Shoes. All right, let's go. There was a horrible accident today. At least that's what
[10984.01s -> 10987.77s]  the managers are calling it. One of the other employees brought in some outside food and got
[10987.77s -> 10991.85s]  into a fight with the manager about it. No one's coming in here, right? The employee said that the
[10991.85s -> 10996.17s]  burgers here smell like sulfur. I then watched the manager grab the kid's neck and shove his
[10996.17s -> 11000.49s]  head into the grill. The employee got up and ran out before anyone could do anything and I'm told
[11000.49s -> 11015.35s]  that he's fine, but that really shook me today. I can't sprint in here if you're curious. I think
[11015.35s -> 11027.86s]  because I'm crouching. This is still the same room too. Oh, give me a break. There's something in here.
[11028.82s -> 11041.24s]  What is this?
[11060.92s -> 11092.50s]  Get me out of this. There's a key. Okay, got the key. What's that key for? In here? The freezer.
[11092.50s -> 11103.98s]  Hey, one of these is gonna wake up and I hear somebody behind me. I can hear somebody here.
[11104.70s -> 11110.55s]  I got another key. I hear somebody behind me. I hear somebody. What's that music supposed to mean?
[11111.43s -> 11118.54s]  One of these is gonna grab me. What's the what's the fucking key for, folks? What's the demon?
[11121.66s -> 11124.62s]  What the fuck am I supposed to do about the demon? How do I get out of here?
[11128.52s -> 11151.98s]  Whoa! What door is it for? That's the entrance. I'm dead. It's the Burger King demon. Did I just
[11151.98s -> 11166.87s]  break the game? I don't know what that specimen does. I don't understand. This looks like somebody
[11166.87s -> 11176.38s]  in the room. Is somebody in this room? No. He hides the doors. You dastardly motherfucker.
[11177.42s -> 11189.88s]  Oh, no, no. It's too hard to get away from people when they're...
[11223.26s -> 11241.72s]  Hey, just go, go, go, go, go, go. Don't stop for nothing. Unless it's the squid person.
[11244.52s -> 11248.54s]  Oh, not you again. I'm actually not scared of this person at all.
[11249.10s -> 11265.00s]  I don't even know what this thing does, but it doesn't scare me.
[11274.34s -> 11275.14s]  Oh, don't get...
[11280.28s -> 11283.56s]  They float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float,
[11283.56s -> 11287.64s]  they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float,
[11288.20s -> 11310.60s]  go, they float, they float, they float. Oh, this is bad.
[11312.60s -> 11328.42s]  Okay, this sounds like when your English teacher has, they have a Halloween event
[11329.94s -> 11339.88s]  and like Mrs. Stevenson recorded some scary lines and it's played over the school haunted house.
[11340.76s -> 11361.50s]  Your flesh is mine. No, but you know what I'm saying. It's like a...
[11363.14s -> 11386.33s]  I made it. Weird fucking teachers. No, no. Unlimited stamina. Thanks a lot.
[11386.33s -> 11394.04s]  I told you it was going to be pumpkin cheese cake latte. I told you this and I, it's, I told you.
[11397.85s -> 11404.02s]  Eee. It's going to be pumpkin cheesecake latte and then someone's going to be,
[11404.02s -> 11407.62s]  a scary ghost is going to be drinking a latte at the end and that's the joke.
[11408.34s -> 11422.62s]  If I got it, don't tell me I got it. Infinite stamina. Oh, well, here's the, the kicker here
[11422.62s -> 11432.52s]  is the stamina. There is no, there is no sprint. I can't run. I think the effectiveness of the
[11432.52s -> 11436.52s]  specimens is also somewhat related to the souls of the people that they killed. Anyway, I'm still
[11436.52s -> 11441.72s]  alive and strong, but I feel like the most, the inmost cave of my journey lies ahead. I wonder
[11441.72s -> 11451.35s]  what the antagonists will look like. I hope they're cute. No more sprinting. That's not good.
[11455.46s -> 11481.10s]  He's clenching his ass. I probably will be in about a hundred rooms. So how do you get away
[11481.10s -> 11486.14s]  from things if you can't, do I have to seriously run and like walk in a circle to bait around in
[11486.14s -> 11495.91s]  a circle and not get stabbed somehow? How does one do this? This is impossible with some of these
[11495.91s -> 11513.40s]  monsters. I have to kill. Infinite axe attacks too though. That's right. That's a good call.
[11514.12s -> 11528.25s]  Just jump on them like Super Mario. Thankfully, it's 750. They, they did that because this would
[11528.25s -> 11534.14s]  be a pain in the ass to walk through all these again. So I get it. Let's make it not happen to
[11534.14s -> 11561.08s]  me. Pac-Man's like my favorite character. Why would I do that? Oh, I can move again.
[11562.04s -> 11565.19s]  Big mistake. Giving that back.
[11567.75s -> 11585.38s]  Finally, I get a computer. Finally, I get some extra computer time. Let's see. Specimen. Where
[11585.38s -> 11591.82s]  were we? Eight. Okay. A float guy. I have to get closer. I have to, I'm too far away from the
[11591.82s -> 11600.54s]  screen. I'm standing all the way back here. Like, hold on. Stop. Get out. Back. There we go. Get
[11600.54s -> 11609.53s]  close. You guys have ruined, you've ruined me because that said eat ass in my brain for a second.
[11609.53s -> 11622.62s]  Total fatalities. One. Take the dead. Two. Take the dead. To take the dead. To take the dead.
[11622.62s -> 11633.34s]  That doesn't really help me at all. It does this thing. Parasitic infections that form change a
[11633.34s -> 11639.98s]  creature that is believed to be extraterrestrial though was not officially proven. Proved very
[11639.98s -> 11643.58s]  effective on most subjects but deemed too difficult to contain. The specimen broke out
[11643.58s -> 11653.32s]  of its containment area due to frequent electrical malfunctions. That's the thing. A
[11653.32s -> 11658.86s]  floating red figure that was found inside a secret area below a large abandoned corporate office
[11658.86s -> 11664.34s]  once owned by a restaurant franchise. The specimen is extremely violent and also seems to leave the
[11664.34s -> 11670.10s]  house at will despite various containment methods. Victims vanish on contact with specimen but
[11670.10s -> 11676.90s]  sometimes remains of the victims have been found inside the testing chamber days later. Proved
[11676.90s -> 11695.26s]  not effective as victim's souls do not remain after contact. What does that mean? I want to
[11695.26s -> 11703.64s]  see what this thing is. Proved extremely effective on violent subjects and you just you have to just
[11703.64s -> 11738.62s]  run away. Seven six five. Let's go. Almost the big 800. More of these tubes. What's the lightning
[11738.62s -> 11749.62s]  strike for? I just realized that I never had a mentor figure. Trial or leaving home scene.
[11750.26s -> 11753.94s]  That means the story isn't following the archetypes to make me a traditional hero.
[11754.02s -> 11757.46s]  Which means I could be killed off. Well it was nice for a little while at least.
[11758.26s -> 11781.16s]  I haven't seen a special infected in a while. It's gonna happen soon. Holy shit. Holy shit. I
[11781.16s -> 11817.05s]  wasn't prepared for you to be here. I hate this motherfucker so much. Oh fuck. Where is he gonna
[11817.05s -> 11826.71s]  be? I don't know. Somewhere over here. Oh fuck. I've ruined everything this way. Why?
[11827.51s -> 11846.22s]  Why is it giving me these same shitty rooms over and over again? You dickhead. Heal. Heal for a second.
[11846.78s -> 11858.49s]  Go. Oh fuck you.
[11871.03s -> 11898.89s]  Okay. Look for an arrow. Look at the fish. He's gone. 800. Come on. Don't fuck around. Just get
[11898.89s -> 11904.76s]  there. There's gonna be another thing that's gonna pop up. I don't care. I don't care.
[11917.51s -> 11934.17s]  Special effects. Two. See ya. This is the English teacher.
[11939.00s -> 11957.59s]  All right. No more. No more getting stuck on that one. So English teacher. See ya. 800. 200 more.
[11957.59s -> 11972.55s]  Norma's there. Norma link please. Norma please say hello. Like hello? Why? I don't understand.
[11972.55s -> 11998.22s]  Why? Why? That link didn't open by the way. Click this link. All right. Hold on. I'm gonna
[11998.22s -> 12012.01s]  put this on the screen. I want to read this one. Hey! Did I save the game? Did I save the game?
[12013.40s -> 12020.25s]  I don't think I saved the game. I don't think. Did I save it? Wait. What happened?
[12021.13s -> 12026.57s]  What is going on? Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. This is like a... I can't see chat room. What
[12026.57s -> 12082.52s]  happened? Chat is broken right now. Why did it open like five doors? Streamer fatalities. Method
[12082.52s -> 12087.96s]  bad jokes. This specimen likes to make funny noises and bad jokes in order to satisfy the voices in
[12087.96s -> 12094.84s]  his head. Escaped confinement throughout the use of a hot air balloon. Actually insane. Avoid all
[12094.84s -> 12104.58s]  contact. Use the word boomer if approached to drive it up. That's a pretty good one.
[12105.46s -> 12113.46s]  I hope I saved the game because that would be a no- I would hate to have to go through
[12114.26s -> 12128.22s]  those 50 zones again. 800. Thank god. Saved. 800. Got the axe. I'm ready. Let's move.
[12129.50s -> 12139.85s]  I'm gonna find out what the real story of this game actually is. Did I make it to 800 in the time
[12139.85s -> 12149.05s]  that was a lot? I didn't realize that guy had a unique kill screen in save rooms. That's
[12149.05s -> 12165.91s]  completely new to me. Yeah. That was kind of weird. Yeah. Day two. Food supply depleted.
[12165.91s -> 12170.47s]  Water supply at 30%. Mental health deteriorating. Leaving notes behind to help others and mark where
[12170.47s -> 12194.17s]  I've been. Is there more? No. Day two. Room 800. Well, I'll be fair to the game. I've been streaming
[12194.17s -> 12200.73s]  for three and a half hours and gone through 800 rooms. So, I mean, that's- that makes sense. It
[12200.73s -> 12241.74s]  would take you that long if you weren't sprinting. Did I always wait till 809? 709? Okay. It's still
[12241.74s -> 12255.06s]  the same room somehow. Broken. This is a big room. This mansion is strange. I think the bricks and
[12255.06s -> 12260.82s]  wood are actually just painted on. Everything still feels kind of fake. Also, I keep hearing
[12260.82s -> 12276.23s]  movement and voices below me. Maybe other survivors are hiding down there. That's strange. Locked.
[12276.23s -> 12290.87s]  Probably go up the stairs. Broken. Okay. Damn library. Someone's gonna be here.
[12292.41s -> 12296.49s]  I can hear him coming down the hallway. I need to hide, but I don't know where.
[12296.49s -> 12300.73s]  I now know this is not an exit or a resting place. It is just another specimen room. I think he's
[12300.73s -> 12316.52s]  outside the door now. Well, where do I hide? Where do you hide, huh? This is a terrible- this is a
[12316.52s -> 12367.40s]  two-year-old hiding spot. He gone? Where is he? Look up there. His head's gonna be poking over
[12367.40s -> 12401.69s]  and he's gonna go, hey! And it's gonna be terrifying. Let's go upstairs. Locked doors. I can't hide there?
[12401.69s -> 12407.54s]  I somehow managed to get away, but I don't know for how long. I hear him. Even when I know he's
[12407.54s -> 12412.26s]  not there, it's like he isn't even real, but instead my own fears manifesting themselves and stalking me.
[12413.22s -> 12430.20s]  Hide. So what? He's not real. So that he can't hurt me. So I'll be fine. Confront him. I need a key.
[12437.64s -> 12535.06s]  Both these doors are broken. Come on. Every room looks the same. Every room's the same room.
[12552.22s -> 12589.66s]  That's one squeaky gamer chair. I'll tell you, I don't think that guy could lift that side.
[12590.30s -> 12596.78s]  I don't think I have anything to worry about. That looks a little too heavy for you.
[12597.34s -> 12619.19s]  Can I recommend a sickle? Can I recommend- can I recommend a knife? It is a sickle.
[12619.19s -> 12625.74s]  There's a side. The side- a sickle is a small side. The side is huge. The side is- it's like
[12625.74s -> 12640.01s]  a harvesting side. Pick up a key. Get the library key. Nice. So that's bedroom, bedroom, library.
[12642.82s -> 12669.03s]  Currently looking for a library. Locked. Is this the library? No. The library is probably-
[12669.67s -> 12690.60s]  let's try this one. Hold on a second here. Library. No. Library. Library.
[12710.52s -> 12724.25s]  What the fuck is happening? None of these are the library.
[12727.16s -> 12728.04s]  That's not the library.
[12753.45s -> 12768.02s]  What? I- I don't know where the library is. Where is it? Stop it. Stop- I've been in every
[12768.02s -> 12794.87s]  single door. I've been in every door. All the same room. Oh my god. There's a book missing.
[12794.87s -> 12838.58s]  Other- hide, hide. This is the relatable content that I come here for. Thanks a lot.
[12838.58s -> 12850.28s]  I feel like I could just go push him. That's a full four and a half seconds for you to lift up
[12850.28s -> 12866.87s]  that. I could just shove you to the ground. Do it then, because this is taking way too long.
[12866.87s -> 12902.18s]  I'm just gonna go. Are you going? I didn't hear the door open. Picked up the book. Go replace
[12902.18s -> 12940.84s]  the book in the library. Secret door. Finally made it out of here. What the fuck does that mean?
[12941.48s -> 12959.10s]  I'm still in room 810? Man. Oh, remember when the note said I can hear people running around down
[12959.10s -> 12977.54s]  here? Was I hearing me? What does that mean? Why is this music changing? Oh, give me a break.
[12983.78s -> 12997.99s]  I'm still doing laps upstairs. I get a note down here. I can hear somebody running around in circles
[12997.99s -> 13017.30s]  upstairs. It's really odd. I wonder what they're up to. This is all one floor. I hope I make it
[13017.30s -> 13043.88s]  to 850, because I don't want to do this whole thing again. Exit. Exit key. What do you mean the exit
[13043.88s -> 13069.82s]  key? I don't know. I know. It's the door. It's the door. It's the door up here. It's up. And then
[13070.86s -> 13078.09s]  it's somewhere. I have to remember. Goldfish, goldfish, goldfish, goldfish kid. Goldfish kid.
[13079.93s -> 13091.05s]  Go up. Out. Out of here. Out of here. Out of here. Oh no. I'm gonna get lost again.
[13091.45s -> 13145.03s]  That's what somebody, that bagpipe player face. Don't make me laugh right now. A bagpipe player.
[13145.91s -> 13188.47s]  What does that even mean? Give me 850. Ah, shit. Hello. Why is everybody linking me saying hello?
[13189.03s -> 13209.86s]  Nobody was. I think one person did actually. One person linked me saying hello. And I said
[13209.86s -> 13228.66s]  everybody. I just lumped you all together. Only like 10 more. What is it? What is it though? What
[13228.66s -> 13253.58s]  is it? Okay, stay close. This is thing blocking me. I'm so glad I only have to do this for like
[13253.58s -> 13284.23s]  six more floors. He doesn't know. No, I don't. I, I, I do not. You're right. I don't, I don't know.
[13285.19s -> 13317.37s]  49. All right, let's go. 50. Oh, this is bad. Okay, I have to do all 100.
[13322.31s -> 13335.05s]  That's not good. What am I, what am I doing? I got complacent for like 30 seconds.
[13344.63s -> 13349.00s]  Just run now. No, I'm good. I didn't go away. I didn't go away far enough for long enough.
[13349.00s -> 13358.60s]  I really just don't, I don't want to do this again. So I need to be locked in to get to 900.
[13359.24s -> 13389.99s]  At least this gives me a minute to relax. I think this is locked. I may have made a mistake coming
[13389.99s -> 13412.09s]  back here. This is locked, I think. Check it. No. Attack it. No. I'm not gonna. He's still here.
[13412.81s -> 13455.45s]  He's still here. He's still here. It's this way. Good thing I did it. It's either way. It doesn't
[13455.45s -> 13464.31s]  matter. Just run. You cannot run. Come on, guys. Don't you know this by now? I can't run from this
[13464.31s -> 13471.27s]  thing. If I run far enough away, it turns into a mother monster that I cannot run from. Now we're
[13471.27s -> 13505.37s]  good. Almost there. Not long now. Just go faster. I have a stamina bar. I can't do that. I'm just
[13505.37s -> 13519.29s]  waiting to hear that pound. It's a ding. It's a ding donk. Left. Left. Three lefts. And then a
[13519.29s -> 13543.40s]  straight. Three lefts and then a right. I'm good. Game room. I already played all these. 30 more
[13543.40s -> 13553.35s]  rooms. Is it? Oh, it's this thing. I forget. I remember. I forget what this one does. I have
[13553.35s -> 13558.89s]  to go back and then run this way. It's gonna scream. Get ready. Here comes the scream. It's
[13558.89s -> 13611.85s]  gonna scream at you. Just do it already. All right, sit up. Don't lose it here. I can taste it. Come
[13611.85s -> 13634.84s]  on. What is it? What is it? What does that mean? I don't remember. There's too many monsters to
[13634.84s -> 13669.56s]  remember. I looked at chat for a second and it was one of those poppers. What is it? Monk! I'm
[13669.56s -> 13677.69s]  actually okay with this. I'm all right with this. That's fine. It's just not knowing what it is.
[13678.33s -> 13685.45s]  I can't believe I'm actually going to do this. I'm gonna get to the floor thousand.
[13699.02s -> 13715.40s]  Four more and I get to 900. Almost there. Come on. Two. 899. This is it. This is the home stretch.
[13720.18s -> 13748.14s]  Only 100 more floors. And that's it. And I beat the game. Here we go. You're still on the first
[13748.14s -> 13785.67s]  island. You used that one last night. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, left, straight.
[13789.02s -> 13798.31s]  Okay. Day three. Hallucinations are manifesting at increasing intervals. The cause is probably
[13798.31s -> 13804.23s]  sleep deprivation or a gas that is being pumped into the rooms. I've not yet been injured so I
[13804.23s -> 13823.90s]  don't think the cause is a brain injury or blood clot. It's this thing. Oh no.
[13825.10s -> 13833.10s]  Counting how many times I've said oh no. Or what does he do? What does he do? What does he do?
[13846.42s -> 13852.90s]  Research report. More whales are being shipped to the facility tomorrow. Wow. One for a health
[13852.90s -> 13857.70s]  inspection and two that are already dead for autopsies. That thing's gonna attack me from
[13857.70s -> 13861.94s]  somewhere. More and more beached whales keep appearing around these islands and I still can't
[13861.94s -> 13872.76s]  find out what's causing it. I don't even have a flashlight or anything. I am going to get stuck
[13872.76s -> 13883.10s]  here. Whale 15D has died much sooner than I expected while I was away on holiday. I regret
[13883.10s -> 13888.38s]  not being here but I had estimated it would live much longer. The team that did the autopsy said
[13889.02s -> 13894.30s]  nothing seemed to be wrong with the lungs but the stomach had a circular hole about two feet
[13894.30s -> 13899.26s]  in diameter all the way through to the outside of the whale. This pretty much confirms a parasite
[13899.26s -> 13917.74s]  is the cause of death. There's the whale. What is going on in this game? And now I have to deal with
[13917.74s -> 13928.98s]  this stuff. I have to try to remember this. It's so dark. I'm gonna get so lost. The research
[13928.98s -> 13934.18s]  facility is now in dire need of more engineers. We have a whole block that is flooded and some
[13934.18s -> 13950.14s]  vital staff are missing. Is there a key or something? Shit. Can we get a sweat check?
[13952.44s -> 13971.38s]  It's gone. It's going. It's oh it's it's going. It's still alive but gets into fits of thrashing
[13971.38s -> 13977.80s]  and is surfacing more from the natural. Something wrong with its lungs. I will have to allow it to
[13977.80s -> 13986.20s]  die from whatever is causing it and then do an autopsy. Whale 14D has strange small bite marks.
[13986.20s -> 13990.28s]  They appear from another smaller mammal but the strange thing about them is their placement.
[13990.28s -> 13994.12s]  They're in even rows inside the whale's stomach all about five feet from the bottom of the stomach
[13994.12s -> 14012.89s]  lining. I just got a lantern. This thing doesn't run out of gas right? Excerpt 4132 and then I
[14012.89s -> 14018.89s]  watched carelessly as the sea rose above the sky casting waving shadows over the world. I saw the
[14018.89s -> 14022.89s]  silhouettes of creatures both familiar and forgotten and suddenly I found myself falling
[14022.89s -> 14044.01s]  upwards towards an ocean of darkness. All right four one what was it four one four one three what
[14044.01s -> 14070.97s]  four one three four one two three there it is read I hear a girl or an animal or something
[14070.97s -> 14076.25s]  singing to me pleading that I come outside my locked room and let the sweeping waves comfort me
[14079.10s -> 14090.92s]  water pump control restarting pumps what is uh where do I go what does that even do
[14091.64s -> 14094.49s]  what does that do what's that even do though what's that do
[14096.34s -> 14125.24s]  is the whale did I did I drain the pump did I drain the whale this was the same place twice
[14140.36s -> 14162.26s]  there is one two doors here this was under water is it going to be like a killer whale
[14162.26s -> 14203.11s]  if the whale is going to be on here there's nothing in this room did I try every door broken
[14203.19s -> 14217.30s]  it's broken did I miss like a key on the ground or anything on anything in here
[14217.30s -> 14225.24s]  at all I don't think there's anything in here why would I be able to come in here though
[14235.13s -> 14256.02s]  nothing in here either funny joke what the hell are you talking about what do you mean funny
[14256.02s -> 14262.06s]  joke I'm trying to go in all these doors there's nothing in any of them there's a key on the box
[14263.02s -> 14282.22s]  what like in this room okay let me be fucking real with you for a second that key is painted
[14282.22s -> 14312.87s]  on the top of the box it's all good all right where's the locked one there's a locked one here
[14312.87s -> 14324.66s]  you can't go in that locked one and there's nothing else in here so this is a key for a
[14324.66s -> 14334.55s]  different door back here you're legally mad and you're internally sad what about over here broken
[14334.55s -> 14348.20s]  come on who the hell are you whoa you're an enemy and you're now in the am I safe here
[14348.20s -> 14368.14s]  I think I'm safe here holy fucking hell I'm safe on the boxes wait for full health go
[14390.92s -> 14404.89s]  this way and then this way it's not so bad once once you know what you're doing
[14429.19s -> 14431.83s]  there's even more of this shit at least the numbers are going up
[14432.63s -> 14461.46s]  box steps what happened to the whale oh let me see a box I don't see a box
[14465.85s -> 14503.86s]  I think I just screwed myself nope right here let's go right how many more of these do I have to do
[14504.66s -> 14528.58s]  919 920 am I just stuck down here for the rest of the time that I play this game
[14529.22s -> 14550.81s]  I got out of the water I'm starting to lose track of time the battery on my phone became very low
[14550.81s -> 14566.50s]  so I delegated to save it in case I find an exit where is it a phone all that was an axe
[14568.70s -> 14588.38s]  holy shit it's the guy with the thing in his arm what you I thought it was him I thought that was

[14951.35s -> 14956.47s]  specimens sometimes chooses a host to possess and uses them to attack the subject with various means
[14956.47s -> 14960.31s]  depending on the host's characteristics not much is known about the origin of the mansion but
[14960.31s -> 14964.23s]  signs occasionally show an earlier massacre a tragedy has taken place within the mansion
[14964.23s -> 14968.70s]  we're very effective but varies itself too often to be reliable method of extraction
[14968.70s -> 14987.64s]  so the house is alive this is not a time to use the computer this is not a time to use the pc

[16083.86s -> 16092.90s]  um immediately hopefully within the next 10 minutes because that's not all right
[16094.42s -> 16107.91s]  I'm so glad that that you added flushing toilets in the DLC think of a joke quick there isn't I
[16107.91s -> 16124.26s]  wouldn't there's blood in a urinal I mean it's an improv class let's do uh blood uh in a urinal
[16124.82s -> 16135.96s]  and you're at the hospital and um and there's a banana involved okay well gotta use the bat
[16135.96s -> 16163.45s]  no that's gonna go bad it's getting scary never say no to an improv session I don't know how
[16163.45s -> 16170.49s]  poorly I would do it an improv session I'd probably be pretty bad it would be bad I would
[16170.49s -> 16176.10s]  be doing stream references and all the people that were there watching the improv session would have
[16176.10s -> 16181.40s]  no idea what they were I would throw that you'd see at least like one or two like look at me
[16181.40s -> 16189.70s]  and the people watching would be like that's not funny wait hold on uh patient displayed
[16189.70s -> 16194.02s]  increased depression after informed of their terminal disease I prescribed an antidepressant
[16194.02s -> 16198.20s]  to regulate this but was later told that I had canceled the prescription no memory of
[16198.20s -> 16201.00s]  canceling the meds nor the quantity of evidence that my orders were tampered with
[16202.20s -> 16219.18s]  okay now it's a yes and a string I remember playing SCP with these stairs um let me check
[16219.18s -> 16230.38s]  the other rooms that stream would start out with a bunch of people watching and then after they
[16230.38s -> 16238.86s]  realized that this was not a good improv session half of the people would leave they would be like
[16238.86s -> 16244.46s]  wow an improv session on twitch the wits is so interesting wow that's so cool and look at me
[16244.46s -> 16252.02s]  look at me I got a banana here oh whoopsie and it would be like this I ain't a professional
[16252.02s -> 16277.34s]  I'm a professional clown hey no I can't move that way broken and it might be fun though
[16277.90s -> 16292.22s]  office key seems we're losing patients due to surgical complications much more often than
[16292.22s -> 16296.62s]  normal what have the doctors been doing half these procedures seem completely unnecessary
[16296.62s -> 16301.18s]  I know the doctors and surgeons are above me and probably know many things I don't but this is
[16301.18s -> 16321.46s]  getting strange oh by the way this is just coming out of like left field here but um I know I
[16321.46s -> 16325.86s]  mentioned it yesterday but I'm getting in front of the I'm going in front of the green screen again
[16328.12s -> 16336.57s]  in probably like at some point after Halloween at some point after Halloween like maybe like the
[16336.57s -> 16341.29s]  first week of November or something I'm gonna we're gonna do a green screen part two DLC for
[16341.29s -> 16346.73s]  free edition where I spend like another five to six hours doing all the things that anybody wants
[16346.73s -> 16363.54s]  me to do that's after Halloween after Halloween do six hours of look at me I'm not gonna do that
[16363.54s -> 16374.65s]  all right I gotta I got the office key that's that all right it's upstairs and I think it's
[16374.65s -> 16385.86s]  one of the ones I couldn't do before so there has not been a monster yet which is the one that
[16385.86s -> 16406.82s]  was locked stairs broken now remember wash your hands remember wash your hands everyone
[16407.86s -> 16423.59s]  of uh remember wash your hands remember wash your hands everyone of
[16424.23s -> 16434.71s]  clean your workspace I'm attending to the office work hard and have a nice day I don't know
[16434.71s -> 16443.21s]  I can't read that any of you guys in office which one of you guys is an office
[16444.09s -> 16459.32s]  none of you are in office so where's the office back here looks like an office
[16461.02s -> 16466.22s]  it seems the other me has been giving him large doses of hallucinations they have
[16466.22s -> 16469.42s]  worsened the depression and he is now constantly screaming and expressing terror at seemingly
[16469.42s -> 16476.30s]  random intervals I've tried using a diet out assist machine it to remove some of the drugs
[16476.30s -> 16503.90s]  but it seems futile office what's that looks like something goes here so there's a little
[16503.90s -> 16525.61s]  thing that's got to fit in that slot a little circle broken nothing in here I don't know
[16526.65s -> 16531.74s]  another note I was just informed that the procedure to extract the patient's liver
[16531.74s -> 16537.66s]  became fatal I don't know why why did we take his liver there are no donation requests and he was
[16537.66s -> 16542.94s]  showing signs of improvement the surgical staff told me I personally demanded the liver be removed
[16542.94s -> 16548.14s]  for an emergency transplant and the worst thing is I found it I found his liver his entire liver
[16548.14s -> 16571.02s]  just sitting on my desk maintenance key that's horrible maintenance diff deformity wing looks
[16571.10s -> 16583.42s]  fake it's electrically sealed I blacked out today while driving to work one minute I was driving
[16583.42s -> 16587.82s]  down the road and then in an instant I was standing outside my car staring down at a dead cat
[16587.82s -> 16592.38s]  I must have hit it with my car and felt sorry the image of the dead cat has constantly unnerved me
[16592.38s -> 16597.02s]  today how did I manage to hit it in such a way to make the body completely twisted around like that
[16597.74s -> 16618.84s]  that's not good all right I have the maintenance key now maintenance save it so we've got two
[16618.84s -> 16625.40s]  ways to go here this this is not open but where's maintenance because these are
[16626.36s -> 16634.02s]  hospital rooms the stairs going down was it another stairway was it downstairs because this
[16634.02s -> 16656.98s]  is locked I would feel like a maintenance room would be down here maintenance room the generator
[16656.98s -> 16684.73s]  powered down uh it won't turn back on oh this is good why did you do that to progress the story
[16684.73s -> 16698.87s]  to progress the game I definitely have to just go back upstairs so this is not so much a this is
[16698.87s -> 16744.31s]  like a whole new little mini game huh great where was that tendril wasn't there a tendril
[16744.87s -> 16761.21s]  there was like that big like uh amorphous thing you guys know what I'm talking about
[16761.21s -> 16784.02s]  remember the thing I was trying to hit with the axe it was down one of these hallways fake okay
[16784.10s -> 16816.54s]  okay just paint it on nope patient did not recover from the blood loss I feel like there is a monster
[16816.54s -> 16821.02s]  inside my head and it's pushing me away while it works on something I woke up in the patient's
[16821.02s -> 16827.50s]  room standing over him while an arterial catheter was in the patient letting him just bleed out into
[16827.50s -> 16876.60s]  the floor ah something gonna happen here something is happening what's what's going on why is it
[16876.60s -> 16899.85s]  happening other than what the numbers are there numbers I feel like I shouldn't move yet
[16900.89s -> 16919.62s]  that was cool maybe I have to do that eventually for some other reason
[16927.11s -> 16950.22s]  wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait where's this
[16950.22s -> 16983.27s]  happening it's screaming man encore just a couple of bags not a big deal you better believe that
[16983.27s -> 16984.95s]  guy's gonna start following me around
[17016.10s -> 17042.10s]  stairs fucking halls it is a hospital so I guess that makes sense just looking for a note
[17043.40s -> 17056.73s]  anything to explain anything back here I still need to find that thing that goes in the
[17056.73s -> 17073.29s]  wall these stairs they go up or down they go down this is the thing I was talking about it's down
[17073.29s -> 17084.87s]  here right here see that's what I was talking about nothing else I can do down here go back
[17085.03s -> 17111.02s]  up there walk through it I don't think I can all right so I need a medallion for the office

[17138.23s -> 17149.29s]  stairs and there's the guy standing in front of the door with the bags what the hell to do with

[18473.43s -> 18480.66s]  mom said have to leave well your your mother should know that we're playing a scary game
[18480.66s -> 18496.65s]  and sometimes you get terrified where is he there he is this bag doesn't seem very fast
[18497.37s -> 18509.64s]  and he doesn't seem hostile okay he is hostile but he's very slow he hurts a lot though
[18515.70s -> 18532.41s]  isolation where it was down right wasn't it down wasn't it down it was down wasn't it I passed it
[18533.80s -> 18547.75s]  no I didn't no it was down yeah it was down in the morgue so this is incorrect it's the one that
[18547.75s -> 18571.10s]  has the blood on it where was that because there's this one through here I think it's this yeah it's
[18571.10s -> 18593.85s]  this one right here down to the isolation room which is here we are okay open note it wasn't me
[18593.85s -> 18598.41s]  I swear it wasn't it may have been my body and my hands but I know it wasn't me
[18601.34s -> 18616.71s]  what is me it was just my body my hands and my intention but I didn't do it it wasn't me
[18620.68s -> 18630.10s]  that's not a really good defense will the defendant please rise and state what they just said
[18630.10s -> 18639.82s]  in private I stabbed him and I strangled him and I said in my I was like I'm God want to
[18639.82s -> 18645.85s]  strangle you and I stabbed you but I don't I don't I didn't do it though somebody else did

[18670.26s -> 18675.14s]  but if I keep using the radiology machine to dose my head with radiation then they go away for a
[18675.14s -> 18694.07s]  while this is fucking crazy how big is this area this place is huge another note no I went
[18694.07s -> 18738.78s]  backwards sorry I went backwards that door is locked remember it where the hell is this

[18786.87s -> 18805.40s]  okay that was kind of funny I think I got it no I think I don't got it um there's a bug on my head
[18812.42s -> 18818.54s]  it's just that's okay that's not a rumor that's in the game I thought that was two
[18818.54s -> 18843.02s]  rumors back to back well here's the fun part they're lost too we both can't find each other
[18843.02s -> 18857.08s]  got it I'm so sorry my little angel I tried hating the man that took you from us but in the end the
[18857.08s -> 18860.44s]  only person I hate is myself you always like to scare people especially when they didn't
[18860.44s -> 18866.52s]  understand something I was confounded no one understood your costume but I guess people don't
[18866.52s -> 18872.68s]  read Poe anymore even with the new Price film that man clearly overreacted to your fireworks
[18872.68s -> 18888.52s]  we can only blame PTSD suffer so much what exit key I have to go through the maze again
[18889.80s -> 18961.19s]  through the maze again no I don't go where's that exit it's over here somewhere yeah

[19009.11s -> 19012.71s]  the weird like organic material that was in the hallways
[19013.59s -> 19019.29s]  but could I not do anything with those things oh that's actually the good ending
[19019.29s -> 19053.46s]  oh you have to beat the game boy game wait ghost cow let's work build your own mansion that's going

[20116.55s -> 20127.14s]  what is this this is uh all right yeah the sub train sub train clock how does this even do
[20129.62s -> 20146.33s]  always shows zero when inactive all right well get that shit off the screen but anyways thanks
[20146.33s -> 20149.93s]  everybody for watching we're gonna do the bits and everything if you're new to the channel
[20150.65s -> 20156.09s]  at the end of a stream we do a wind down where I go over all the bit messages that were certain
[20156.09s -> 20163.83s]  threshold because I do not read messages on stream I do not read subs or bit messages on stream
[20163.83s -> 20172.30s]  unless they are of a very large denomination and it did happen somebody gave 5 000 bits earlier
[20172.30s -> 20178.92s]  somebody gave 50 dollars earlier and I didn't see it it was a little too locked in to the horror
[20178.92s -> 20190.41s]  game but back we had a I missed this too uh Tyler McVicker I came in with a raid earlier so thank
[20190.41s -> 20195.19s]  you appreciate that if you had a good stream if anybody was stuck around from that channel thanks
[20195.19s -> 20206.44s]  a lot I lied about Darkwood what are you talking about playing it tomorrow I said if I still had
[20206.44s -> 20219.61s]  time today I was gonna move on to it but I'm just gonna play it tomorrow what what don't let Darkwood
[20219.61s -> 20233.59s]  become the new dragon's dogma I'm playing Darkwood tomorrow that is the stream tomorrow huh I'm going
[20233.59s -> 20242.97s]  to complete Darkwood hopefully tomorrow I don't believe you so you admit the dragon's dogma is
[20242.97s -> 20259.02s]  never happening no it's not it's not I'm sorry get your Pluto's out you ever lied about Darkwood
[20259.90s -> 20266.12s]  I said if I had I said if this I said if this game took me like three or four hours then I would play
[20266.12s -> 20273.99s]  Darkwood for a few hours but this took like almost six hours so that's we're just gonna put it on
[20274.95s -> 20280.87s]  I'm just going tomorrow everybody just relax Martin had a meme thanks for the 250 bits
[20280.87s -> 20286.36s]  appreciate it I'm a big fan of the private school bully who constantly brings up how much money his
[20286.36s -> 20298.26s]  dad is worth hair get out of here thank you green bog for the thousand bits thank you today's my
[20298.26s -> 20304.58s]  birthday I'm a 22 year old depressed and neat I'm learning Japanese because I like cute anime shows
[20304.58s -> 20311.14s]  which helps take away the pain so I might be some translator or live in Japan it feels romanticized
[20311.14s -> 20318.23s]  but it is my only chance at experiencing real life well let me tell you something very very very
[20318.23s -> 20327.77s]  very seriously if you're doing something that you like if you want to be a translator learn Japanese
[20327.77s -> 20351.58s]  and live in Japan go for it do it grab it by the horns and do it and go for it there are a lot
[20352.22s -> 20357.02s]  let me tell you something there are a lot of companies that really do look for translators
[20357.02s -> 20366.79s]  and look for people to kind of be the middle person for a offshore companies like for instance Kim
[20366.79s -> 20372.23s]  speaks fluent Vietnamese there are a lot of opportunities for her to just be the middle
[20372.87s -> 20381.32s]  woman for a Vietnamese client for different companies it is it's a skill it is a thing being
[20381.32s -> 20389.37s]  bilingual trilingual it that's that's a skill it takes a lot to do that to know like two three
[20389.37s -> 20400.26s]  or four languages fluently completely so what you're describing is potentially a real thing
[20403.19s -> 20411.05s]  go find it I really hope you do happy birthday by the way 22 years old you have plenty of time
[20413.83s -> 20430.34s]  you're still young very young so don't worry do what you can I wish you the best of luck take care
[20435.18s -> 20439.10s]  sticks renegade thanks for the 250 unfortunately pappaginos and d'angelo's are beginning to close
[20439.10s -> 20444.94s]  down that's a horrible thing to hear there's three left near me d'angelo's in this place and
[20444.94s -> 20457.86s]  pappaginos here and one more here I miss five dollar unlimited pizzas why is pappaginos closing
[20457.86s -> 20469.05s]  down they had the best chain pizza I've ever had pappaginos is disgusting goodbye omega lull
[20469.37s -> 20482.31s]  all right for one second I thought you were saying that like pappaginos is disgusting all
[20482.31s -> 20490.34s]  right goodbye I'm gonna get banned like bye omega lull like I gotta get this out before he bans me
[20490.34s -> 20501.82s]  for saying this give him two minutes that's unfortunate because I really do like pappaginos
[20501.82s -> 20513.67s]  pizza I would not choose pappaginos over some non-chain Italian restaurants in some local
[20513.67s -> 20519.75s]  pizza places way better but if I had to pick a chain pappaginos would probably be the best one
[20526.07s -> 20531.16s]  but yeah that's that's sad to hear thank you pigeon for the 250 this is a thought I had in
[20531.16s -> 20546.74s]  the shower whose customer service was or is worse cox or comcast cox cox because there seems to be
[20546.74s -> 20554.18s]  so many people that work for cox and none of them talk to each other at least with comcast so I had
[20554.18s -> 20561.91s]  comcast business and cox business and comcast business when they sent somebody out that person
[20562.71s -> 20568.63s]  at least was in communication with somebody else that they needed to be in communication with
[20568.63s -> 20576.18s]  to help fix a problem the cox support they just they're none of them talk to each other
[20576.82s -> 20583.06s]  so you have like the tech guy the mechanic you cox has like five character classes
[20584.15s -> 20593.00s]  the phone support phone maintenance supervisor it's it's there's so many people
[20595.59s -> 20601.75s]  sales you'll get a call from sales and all of them have no idea what the other person has just told
[20601.75s -> 20611.67s]  you I would get I would ask questions right for I'm going to give you a very specific example of
[20611.67s -> 20621.19s]  this so a technician a maintenance technician told me a straight-up maintenance guy in the truck
[20621.19s -> 20626.39s]  said hey if you get a static IP it actually is going to push your traffic to the front of the
[20626.39s -> 20631.75s]  line possibly and might help out because it's a static IP okay that's really cool let me call and
[20631.75s -> 20636.47s]  talk to somebody about getting a static IP hey if I get a static IP yeah I want it because it's
[20636.47s -> 20645.26s]  going to put my traffic potentially in the front of the line no it isn't who told you that um the
[20645.26s -> 20651.00s]  person in the truck the pride and then you would say a name I don't know what that is we don't know
[20651.00s -> 20659.50s]  what those people are I also asked if business lines and for cox have priority over residential
[20659.50s -> 20668.58s]  and I was told by three different fucking people yes no yes and then no by the guy in the truck
[20668.58s -> 20679.21s]  that's the problem with cox and half the time it's a salesperson that just wants you to buy
[20679.21s -> 20691.40s]  the product and will tell you literally literally anything you want to hear yeah business gets a
[20691.40s -> 20697.64s]  priority traffic and uh yeah it's uh they do different parts priority oh that's awesome
[20698.28s -> 20709.85s]  yeah I'll take it it sounds like a crock of bullshit no it is it's stupid it's hard to even
[20709.85s -> 20718.71s]  get a question answered about if you go further than reset router and
[20721.38s -> 20726.04s]  then if you go further than that that person does not know what to tell you
[20731.34s -> 20738.14s]  Comcast business was it still sucked don't get me wrong here this is not this is a contest
[20738.78s -> 20748.65s]  of who made the worst pie not who made the best pie this is a who made the best disgusting shit
[20748.65s -> 20768.79s]  pie that they shit in and then put it in the oven it's Comcast is better damn yeah it's a it's a
[20768.79s -> 20790.04s]  joke just make your own pie that's all right gross let's go I could sit here and talk about how
[20790.60s -> 20797.10s]  much I'm not a fan of cox and Comcast and I've said it a thousand times for even people that
[20797.10s -> 20803.40s]  might be new here I would pay triple if any of you guys work for Verizon or you know somebody
[20803.40s -> 20811.03s]  that works in Verizon management tell them I would pay quadruple what they are offering right now
[20811.03s -> 20832.41s]  for their fiber if I could just have it rich streamer no I'm do I don't think you understand
[20834.42s -> 20841.08s]  of the Fios internet from there was a package a while ago I'm not sure it might have been a
[20841.08s -> 20849.99s]  promotional thing but this shit was $39.99 for a symmetrical 35 35 connection I think that's
[20849.99s -> 20862.86s]  correct but but like I just can I have that one the ship was $40 a month 35 35 is all I need
[20863.58s -> 20873.11s]  I mean if I wanted to bump it up to like have a little bit more download whatever but still
[20873.11s -> 20881.42s]  that's really really pretty damn good certain streamers have had almost as many issues on
[20881.42s -> 20890.06s]  Verizon but has it was it fiber was it Verizon Fios to the home Verizon DSL and whatever internet
[20890.06s -> 20897.11s]  probably sucks asshole their fiber connection is from my understanding it's one of the best
[20897.11s -> 20918.26s]  connections in the country well fiber is dedicated line yeah well that's what I mean
[20919.14s -> 20930.25s]  Fios is amazing only thing I miss from DC my family has files it's amazing yeah
[20930.25s -> 20933.21s]  tell the pistachio ice cream story again
[20938.46s -> 20943.42s]  Fios and DC is amazing that's all I hear all I hear is yeah files is just incredible files
[20943.42s -> 20952.17s]  just like the best I actually um the the guy that's that's been producing a lot of the events and who
[20952.17s -> 20959.35s]  will continue to um for the streams and stuff said that he had files as well and he told me
[20959.35s -> 20966.95s]  that over I believe it was two years the connection went down once and it was because it was a
[20966.95s -> 20973.08s]  scheduled maintenance for like four hours they just were like upgrading the network
[20973.08s -> 20977.40s]  and it's the only time it ever went down in two years and I'm just sitting there going just
[20977.48s -> 20982.68s]  Verizon like just and then and then here's the sad part of this
[20983.48s -> 20986.84s]  Verizon recently has decided that they're pulling out of the west coast
[20988.41s -> 20992.89s]  Verizon is not going to expand anymore they're pulling out of the west coast I believe they
[20992.89s -> 20997.93s]  sold off all their stuff to a couple of other companies out here somebody correct me if I'm
[20997.93s -> 21011.03s]  wrong the frontier I think that's right they sold off all their stuff to frontier it's taken them
[21011.03s -> 21023.72s]  yep see that's just so sad but the good thing is I will be on an actual fiber connection
[21024.81s -> 21042.82s]  in a couple months depending no I'm staying in Vegas not going back to Boston he's going back
[21047.56s -> 21055.40s]  and I I have asked and it is true fiber it's not one of those fiber to the neighborhood and then
[21055.40s -> 21062.28s]  copper to the street and then copper to the house and then coaxial to your modem no no no no this
[21062.28s -> 21077.61s]  is the real deal what the hell is this suppose that united bank offers to lend you ten thousand
[21077.61s -> 21084.02s]  dollars for one year at a nominal annual rate of eight percent but you must make interest payments
[21084.02s -> 21087.22s]  at the end of each quarter and then pay off the ten thousand principal amount for the end of the
[21087.22s -> 21100.71s]  year what is the effective annual rate on the loan I don't care I don't why do somebody will
[21100.71s -> 21107.05s]  answer that for you apparently I don't know it's not gonna be me don't do it don't do the math

[21241.05s -> 21247.74s]  some reason why and I didn't have a costume and I felt really bad about it and one of my teachers
[21247.74s -> 21254.47s]  at the time don't know what her name was but god bless her soul because she pulled me out of the
[21254.47s -> 21260.87s]  class and said hey because you know I mean I'm upset I wanted to be the red ranger hey okay I

[21289.38s -> 21300.01s]  I have ever seen and I want nothing more than to not ever wear this so I put it on and then I walked

[22108.06s -> 22117.22s]  at once when you picked up one tater tot all 30 of them came up at the same time they were like
[22117.22s -> 22129.53s]  shitty nachos i used to work there and i wouldn't trust the drinks either to be honest
[22130.49s -> 22144.92s]  look if you put a blindfold on me and you put me in a car and you said we're gonna go get food
[22144.92s -> 22150.28s]  i'm not telling you where oh okay and you drove and you took the blindfold off and we were in a
[22150.28s -> 22159.98s]  sonic parking lot okay i sure i'll eat here but i'm not going to go out of my way to go to a sonic
[22160.54s -> 22171.96s]  ever again i would eat it and i'd be like all right i ate it that was all right that was okay
[22172.20s -> 22176.60s]  i guess it was like kind of blah it's good whatever it's food it's worth it i guess
[22181.26s -> 22187.82s]  auto is sleepy and sloppy and loves tater tots so what you're like speaking
[22196.36s -> 22205.56s]  anyways thank you uh thank you spooky spitfire for the 250 germ i literally got her at the end
[22205.56s -> 22212.28s]  of the stream when you were showing auto so it was worth it also i just got to the old hunter's dlc
[22213.26s -> 22217.26s]  and there is a boom hammer hunter with more health than the cleric beast and i don't know
[22217.26s -> 22231.51s]  how to feel about that it's tough that first area in the dlc those guys are no joke blood
[22231.51s -> 22237.74s]  boys dlc by the way is the best dlc of any video game that's ever been made it is the best there's
[22237.74s -> 22254.90s]  a there's one or two small missteps but you dlc is a misstep by a design choice so come on but
[22254.90s -> 22266.94s]  that's wrong well what it is is it's adding here listen you make a video game and you add dlc okay
[22266.94s -> 22273.34s]  fine but a lot of times that dlc ends up costing almost as much as the original game did for
[22275.06s -> 22286.36s]  70 to 80 percent less content you'll spend like 30 40 bucks sometimes on some of these dlcs
[22287.08s -> 22294.46s]  and it doesn't add as much as you play it already in the base game but you're paying for nearly
[22294.46s -> 22308.79s]  like 60 70 sometimes like 75 percent of the base game that's kind of i guess now dlc i think is
[22308.79s -> 22314.47s]  also another one of those things that it has to exist because if you make something that people
[22314.47s -> 22326.70s]  really like you want to do more of that thing for the people that really like it and it gives you
[22326.70s -> 22331.78s]  a reason to go back and play that it's not especially in a single player sense it gives
[22331.78s -> 22339.70s]  you a reason to go back and play it again and experience some new stuff the sims games cost
[22339.70s -> 22355.30s]  like 500 for the full experience and train simulator is like 2000 wasn't there a calculation one time
[22358.42s -> 22373.59s]  it's 7 000 no it's not it's not seven grand but i i enjoy dlc it's just sometimes you'll
[22374.39s -> 22380.31s]  there's no standard of how long or what needs to be added for dlc so that's why it gets weird
[22381.66s -> 22387.48s]  because oh buy the season pass all right i bought the season pass you get everything for 40 dollars
[22387.48s -> 22394.58s]  cool but what what if you don't do like a season pass what if you just buy i want this just this
[22394.66s -> 22400.68s]  single thing that you came out with now oh well that's 25 dollars okay well it's an hour long
[22400.68s -> 22421.18s]  when are we gonna get the germa dlc it's coming out i'm not anti dlc i'm just like what do i get
[22421.18s -> 22426.18s]  for this and sometimes season passes are so vague you really don't even know what the hell you're
[22426.18s -> 22431.45s]  buying you're buying a thing that you don't even know what it exists yet it's not even like
[22431.45s -> 22435.45s]  pre-ordering pre-ordering game when you pre-order a game you know what the game is that you're going
[22435.45s -> 22447.18s]  to buy at least when you buy a season pass it's just hey something gonna show up here you don't
[22447.18s -> 22462.71s]  even know what it is and you know here's another part of this if you buy season pass for a game
[22464.23s -> 22468.95s]  and that content comes out like six seven eight months later almost probably a year later what
[22468.95s -> 22472.47s]  if you don't even play the game anymore what if you don't even know you don't even pay attention
[22472.47s -> 22478.58s]  anymore yeah i want that season pass like a year and eight months goes by and i'll say you like
[22479.30s -> 22491.66s]  you forgot that the game even came out that happens that happens that happens pretty often
[22491.66s -> 22501.90s]  i'm sure well maybe maybe that happened to me with borderlands yeah i mean a good look good
[22501.90s -> 22513.45s]  content is good content i will gladly pay like i have many times for dlc but by its very nature
[22514.17s -> 22522.09s]  it's it can be sort of predatory in a way it's like promising something that doesn't exist yet
[22523.35s -> 22527.91s]  especially if you sell a season pass it's kind of it's season passes is what i have the issue with
[22527.91s -> 22547.61s]  not like actual dlc packages that come out just it's in header it's inherently predatory it's
[22547.61s -> 22552.25s]  just that some dlc is actually good yeah and there are a lot of companies that do put a lot
[22552.25s -> 22573.00s]  of time into it they really do but where there is a yin there is a yang as they say we are no we're
[22573.00s -> 22588.97s]  not i thought we were done we're not done all dlc should be free see i disagree with that because
[22589.85s -> 22596.38s]  how do you pay the people that made it you know people that made the dlc they you have i mean
[22596.38s -> 22601.26s]  like the concept artists the the people that made the dungeons the people that do the character
[22601.26s -> 22605.74s]  design the 3d modelers the programmers like the these the people aren't working for free
[22616.38s -> 22627.90s]  imagine paying for games don't they get paid by a contractual basis i i am not i'm not going to speak
[22628.78s -> 22634.54s]  on how this works in the games industry because i have no idea and i don't want to be one of those
[22634.54s -> 22644.22s]  people that gives you spitballs a bunch of shit that's just not true so i don't know but thank
[22644.22s -> 22656.62s]  you for the 300 bits from hannah has bits hannah has a bits say i don't know if i'm i don't know
[22656.62s -> 22663.22s]  if i'm cheering right this is the first time i've done it i got told you don't read your sub messages
[22663.30s -> 22666.90s]  my sub message was talking about how i've been having a really really hard time and i was just
[22666.90s -> 22671.70s]  wanting to hear you say it would be okay in a reassuring voice and following you for years
[22671.70s -> 22675.38s]  and i'm not trying to be weird but i really wanted to get that out there before tonight ends
[22676.02s -> 22685.21s]  well i'll give you two parts to this if you are having a really really hard time
[22690.02s -> 22700.25s]  and me simply saying that it's going to be okay is going to be enough for you i really just want
[22700.25s -> 22708.68s]  to make sure you understand that that might not be correct and you should try to figure out what's
[22708.68s -> 22719.26s]  going on and also maybe seek some actual potential professional help because it's it's very easy for
[22719.26s -> 22727.53s]  me to do that you know what i mean but i want to make sure that you're okay that you are okay
[22728.33s -> 22742.20s]  and me simply saying those words is not necessarily a magic wand to do so and no it's not you're not
[22742.20s -> 22748.66s]  trying to be weird it's not it's not weird just make sure you're doing the necessary things
[22748.66s -> 22770.94s]  to make yourself feel better and get better you've been following the channel for a long time so
[22770.94s -> 22776.46s]  obviously i don't want people that are following this channel and that say some like stuff like
[22776.46s -> 22780.22s]  this sometimes i don't want you to feel terrible i don't want you to feel bad i want you to feel
[22780.22s -> 22790.66s]  like everything's going to be okay but just be careful putting essentially that power over here
[22791.30s -> 22797.53s]  because i might not actually have that kind of power and me telling you that might it's a you
[22797.53s -> 22809.29s]  know what i'm saying it's a weird scenario where i might not have that power but please please please
[22809.29s -> 22816.95s]  follow up with this if you really are having a problem in a hard time talk to the people that
[22816.95s -> 22831.19s]  can really help with that i wish you the best much love to you take care of yourself i'm sorry that
[22831.19s -> 22836.57s]  you're not having a great time but i will also say this was a two-parter where i said this part
[22836.65s -> 22846.86s]  here oh well i haven't said it but i'm about to regardless of that if it is if it does make you
[22846.86s -> 22853.06s]  happy and staying here and hanging out here makes you feel better that's good and i'm really happy
[22853.06s -> 22870.98s]  to hear that but that should only be a piece a small piece of that puzzle thank you so much
[22870.98s -> 22879.90s]  for your 300 bits your three dollars i wish you the best and please take care of yourself take
[22879.90s -> 22894.71s]  care moving on from that we have 500 bits from super or super tentorium super tentorium thanks
[22894.71s -> 22900.23s]  for the five dollars here this is my quadra request for you to play kerbal space program i
[22900.23s -> 22906.55s]  loaded up kerbal space program and could not figure out anything in the first 30 seconds
[22907.19s -> 22912.98s]  and realized that this was i was never going to learn and i exited the game in fact i can tell
[22912.98s -> 22917.22s]  you i mean that i'm embellishing right so let's see how much time i have in kerbal space program
[22921.42s -> 22942.71s]  kerbal space program let's go to games on steam l m n o p k there it is okay so i have 20 minutes
[22943.51s -> 22948.07s]  in kerbal space program and probably seven or eight of those minutes we're doing menu stuff
[22948.79s -> 22953.94s]  i probably only have about 12 to 13 minutes actually trying to make anything
[22953.94s -> 22964.95s]  that's embarrassing i i'm just told i'm being open with you you stopped before qrs yeah so i'm
[22964.95s -> 22968.63s]  not going to play kerbal space program there's plenty of people that do great hilarious fun
[22968.63s -> 22973.99s]  content with that game you've probably seen it a bunch before you would be very you'd be so
[22973.99s -> 22982.18s]  irritated watching that stream i wouldn't be able to do it i tried i put 10 minutes i put 10 i gave
[22982.18s -> 22991.96s]  it 12 minutes so you know i gave i gave it a shot thank you also uh death gamer thanks to the 250
[22991.96s -> 22995.72s]  hey germa i was wondering what happened to the modern warfare 3 grandpa vids do you still have
[22995.72s -> 23003.93s]  them or are they gone forever that is a machinima problem machinima i made those videos for machinima
[23003.93s -> 23010.36s]  so i was essentially contracted out by machinima to have them put them on machinima respawn
[23011.54s -> 23018.22s]  and then they just privated all of them for seemingly no reason and then machinima has now
[23018.22s -> 23033.43s]  been completely liquidated as a company they don't exist anymore and those videos are gone yeah so
[23033.43s -> 23039.82s]  i do not have access to those videos they are potentially gone forever in fact i think they
[23039.82s -> 23052.65s]  are gone forever which is too bad because that's that's really where i got my actual start kind of
[23052.65s -> 23058.66s]  gaining in viewership and having a channel that was more you know comedy oriented though that
[23058.66s -> 23065.54s]  first like grandpa video did so much like that i did like 12 episodes that did so much for my
[23065.54s -> 23080.74s]  channel that is kind of a shame that they're just gone forever but i didn't i'm not my youtube
[23080.74s -> 23089.40s]  channels are not under contract with machinima anymore so i have no connection to them at all
[23095.51s -> 23101.70s]  yes i there are still a few on my channel i still have like uh maybe three i think there's two or
[23101.70s -> 23111.16s]  three that i uploaded even though you really weren't supposed to i kind of got a pass on a
[23111.16s -> 23115.48s]  couple of them i think because they were i don't know why but i know you weren't really supposed
[23115.48s -> 23126.34s]  to do that but i do not have access to them currently no that is two or three computers ago
[23127.22s -> 23135.27s]  and those hard drives i've brought along with me but then they weren't worth putting in the new
[23135.27s -> 23142.31s]  computers i have two computers from that computer i didn't keep them anymore and they were hard disk
[23142.31s -> 23147.99s]  drives i went to full solid state those hard drives kind of ran out of gas and i didn't really want
[23147.99s -> 23156.55s]  to use them anymore so they're just kind of gone but thank you door cube for the 250 bits i was
[23156.55s -> 23159.99s]  thinking today about how this community is the first one i've ever actively participated in
[23159.99s -> 23165.38s]  and how i have made some friends for life here and i'm still looking forward to the day i meet an
