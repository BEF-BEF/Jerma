[3.51s -> 7.66s]  I can't figure out. There's a song. I got a song caught in my head.
[9.13s -> 12.17s]  Ba ba ba ba ba. I can't figure out what the fuck it is.
[13.19s -> 14.63s]  Like three days.
[14.63s -> 24.22s]  Hey, how you doing? Welcome to the stream everybody. Hey, how you doing?
[24.86s -> 26.62s]  Let's reset. Hey, how you doing?
[26.62s -> 32.82s]  Can we hear more than three notes? I don't know any of the other notes.
[33.46s -> 39.29s]  When is Strawberry Magic 2?
[39.61s -> 43.50s]  You know, uh, you know that was made up.
[44.22s -> 46.22s]  People got my hopes up so bad.
[46.38s -> 55.77s]  There is no Strawberry Magic 2 guys. It doesn't exist. It's not real.
[60.71s -> 64.87s]  Yeah, it's not real. I tried looked for it.
[65.59s -> 76.57s]  But yeah, I'll give you the plan for the next uh, the next week here of streaming content.
[77.45s -> 83.46s]  It's kind of in pre-stream 30-40 minutes ago.
[84.18s -> 87.19s]  We came up with a little bit of a plan.
[87.99s -> 94.10s]  We're gonna play Wobble Dogs for now.
[94.66s -> 97.48s]  If the game's fun, then cool. We'll stick with it.
[98.89s -> 103.14s]  If after an hour or two, I'm like, meh, then we'll move on to the card game.
[104.02s -> 105.22s]  Mon...
[105.22s -> 107.70s]  Well, Mon Bozo? Mon Bozo?
[109.67s -> 112.95s]  If I think Wobble Dogs is a lot of fun, then we'll just do Mon Bozo
[114.04s -> 116.34s]  later this week.
[116.34s -> 118.34s]  Mon Bozo. I don't know how to say it.
[118.34s -> 123.98s]  Strawberry Magic 2 doesn't exist.
[124.54s -> 127.50s]  All the people coming in here. I know the last thing we did was Strawberry Magic.
[128.06s -> 130.94s]  It's fresh in everybody's mind. I know it's fresh in my mind too.
[131.58s -> 134.07s]  Because I had like three or four nightmares about it.
[134.39s -> 138.17s]  It's been fresh since
[138.17s -> 142.60s]  we did that stream.
[142.60s -> 144.84s]  Can you make a Civ 5 reference?
[146.71s -> 150.70s]  Um, I had never played any of the Civilization games.
[152.86s -> 156.54s]  Wait, that's not true. I downloaded Civ Rev
[157.34s -> 159.58s]  on iPad, I think, because it was the easy one.
[160.38s -> 162.38s]  And I didn't even make it through the tutorial.
[162.95s -> 165.99s]  I was just like, no, I don't care. I don't want to do this.
[166.71s -> 170.33s]  Now, let me move my mic. Give me a sec.
[170.33s -> 186.20s]  Why does everybody keep saying Morbius?
[187.70s -> 190.10s]  What's, what's, what's the deal here? What's, what's Morbius?
[190.10s -> 192.98s]  Why are you saying, well, I know what Morbius is, but what do you, why do you keep saying it?
[193.78s -> 195.24s]  Is that the new thing now?
[198.62s -> 199.93s]  All right.
[199.93s -> 201.93s]  Would I like, oh!
[204.30s -> 206.62s]  Uh, my, my whole, my whole body's fucked up.
[207.58s -> 209.42s]  Okay. Uh, what I'd like you to do now,
[210.22s -> 214.14s]  I'd like you to move over to your calendar, whatever your calendar app of your choice is.
[215.02s -> 216.94s]  I'd like you to scroll over to July.
[219.00s -> 225.37s]  And I would like you to mark on your character sheet, on your July sheet.
[226.81s -> 231.37s]  I would like for you to mark July 14th for the baseball stream.
[232.01s -> 234.52s]  July 14th is the baseball stream.
[234.52s -> 237.40s]  Don't have a time yet, but it'll be probably in the afternoon.
[243.13s -> 246.01s]  Here is your hard date. It is set in stone. It is not changing.
[246.73s -> 253.00s]  Unless something, obviously, like, of course it could, but that's the date that we have picked.
[253.00s -> 253.96s]  That's what it's going to be.
[254.52s -> 260.60s]  What if it rains?
[261.24s -> 264.12s]  Well, I, oh my God, don't scare the shit out of me.
[264.12s -> 265.88s]  Why them, them were doing it in the rain.
[265.88s -> 267.96s]  They play baseball games in the rain all the time.
[272.20s -> 273.16s]  Networking Andy?
[274.87s -> 276.63s]  How, this is not Networking Andy.
[276.63s -> 278.39s]  You've known about this show for two years.
[278.39s -> 279.51s]  I just haven't been able to do it.
[280.15s -> 281.64s]  Hold on, I gotta clear my throat.
[281.64s -> 282.68s]  Give me a second.
[282.68s -> 293.58s]  I don't know what's going on.
[294.38s -> 295.98s]  My throat's so fucked up all the time.
[297.45s -> 302.54s]  But, yeah, uh, there's gonna be a lot of interesting stuff on that stream.
[302.54s -> 305.02s]  I think that stream's gonna be one of my most favorite streams ever.
[305.66s -> 309.30s]  I know I say that every time there's an event stream,
[309.30s -> 311.46s]  and I know that I sound like a fucking 80-year-old.
[311.46s -> 312.58s]  Hey, hey kids.
[313.70s -> 314.10s]  I know.
[316.04s -> 317.48s]  You know, they actually turn out that way.
[317.48s -> 317.96s]  It's weird.
[322.94s -> 327.26s]  Every show that I've done over the last, like, two years has been, like, my favorite stream.
[327.26s -> 327.74s]  So, I don't know.
[327.74s -> 329.10s]  We'll see if that trend continues.
[333.08s -> 340.36s]  I think it's gonna be fun.
[340.36s -> 342.12s]  But, yeah, that's, there's your date.
[342.76s -> 348.36s]  The German Baseball Association, July 14th.
[348.36s -> 349.00s]  Mark it again.
[352.44s -> 355.08s]  You sound like you've been taking non-stop bong rips.
[356.04s -> 357.16s]  I don't smoke weed.
[358.04s -> 358.92s]  I don't smoke it.
[359.48s -> 363.34s]  Don't get out of here.
[369.32s -> 372.70s]  Will the pencil be at German Baseball?
[372.70s -> 372.86s]  No.
[375.19s -> 377.43s]  Why on earth would the pencil show up at that stream?
[379.64s -> 382.20s]  I mean, I'm not gonna tell you what's gonna happen on that stream,
[382.20s -> 383.16s]  because I think it's gonna be fun.
[383.72s -> 385.02s]  You already know some of it.
[385.82s -> 389.42s]  But, uh, as, oh, as Oski had to say, he had hype.
[389.98s -> 394.89s]  Is barf drinker gonna be there?
[403.59s -> 405.91s]  I saw you at MGM Grand yesterday.
[405.91s -> 406.55s]  No, you did not.
[408.36s -> 409.40s]  I'm just telling you, you didn't.
[409.96s -> 420.97s]  Will the stream be at 420?
[420.97s -> 421.21s]  No.
[421.93s -> 425.02s]  Are you gonna get big poppy?
[425.98s -> 426.22s]  No.
[428.42s -> 431.14s]  Now, all right, that's, what was the announcement?
[431.14s -> 432.18s]  We're not talking about anything.
[432.18s -> 432.90s]  Any details?
[434.33s -> 436.41s]  Let's move over here and let's play Wobble Dogs.
[436.41s -> 437.45s]  That's what they're starting with today.
[439.38s -> 440.82s]  I promise my voice will get better.
[440.82s -> 442.58s]  If it doesn't, then it's over.
[447.42s -> 447.90s]  I don't get it.
[448.54s -> 449.40s]  But, let's go.
[450.04s -> 452.94s]  Yeah, hope you're doing well.
[452.94s -> 453.82s]  Hope things are going good.
[454.46s -> 455.86s]  Move over here.
[456.74s -> 458.50s]  Uh, this is, I don't even know what the hell this game is.
[459.14s -> 463.30s]  I know it's a game where you have, you take care of dogs and they wobble around.
[464.02s -> 465.08s]  Is it?
[465.08s -> 465.96s]  I just read the title.
[466.68s -> 470.73s]  I read the title of the book and then went to the book club and pretended that I read the book.
[471.29s -> 475.16s]  That was always the worst fucking thing, by the way.
[475.16s -> 481.50s]  Can I just real quickly say how many, it's been a long time since I've been in high school
[481.50s -> 487.10s]  or college or whatever, but I do remember specifically getting the reading, the reading
[487.10s -> 494.47s]  assignment and it was like, okay, we're going to go from page, uh, page, uh, one 50 to one 90.
[494.47s -> 497.11s]  And we're going to have a class discussion about it tomorrow.
[497.11s -> 497.27s]  Right.
[498.15s -> 503.78s]  And we're just not reading it and then having to have the teacher be like, okay, so
[504.50s -> 507.38s]  when this happened, what do you think was really going through their mind?
[508.26s -> 508.66s]  Explain that.
[508.66s -> 509.54s]  What do you think happened there?
[510.10s -> 511.38s]  Whatever the thing was.
[512.54s -> 515.02s]  And yeah, somebody said it, but I'm going to reiterate it.
[515.58s -> 520.06s]  I would pick up clues from what I, if you were the first to get called, it's over.
[520.06s -> 521.26s]  You're fucked.
[521.26s -> 521.90s]  Right.
[521.90s -> 527.50s]  Because then you have to be like, um, well, I, uh, I, uh, my hamster needed it.
[527.50s -> 530.46s]  I didn't take care of my hamster a lot and then, and I didn't read it.
[531.38s -> 537.62s]  But if two or three people went before you, you could kind of pick up the Wikipedia article
[537.62s -> 542.82s]  of what happened in those 30 pages and then just kind of go for it and be like, well, you know,
[543.88s -> 551.43s]  I do think when, when Lenny showed up and I've might have been, and I, I'll tell you right now
[551.43s -> 558.39s]  that story, uh, in the, in the barn and when he was, uh, picking the hay up, I think it went,
[558.39s -> 567.56s]  spoke to what a society in general and how we can handle things and spark notes, dude,
[567.56s -> 569.16s]  I've wrote, I'm not kidding.
[569.16s -> 571.32s]  This, don't take this as like a thing you should do.
[571.32s -> 572.76s]  Don't be a idiot like I am.
[574.31s -> 577.27s]  I think I've wrote an entire paper of a book I didn't read before.
[578.95s -> 582.39s]  I did not read the book at all and I wrote a whole paper about it.
[582.39s -> 585.99s]  And I didn't even like read the cliff notes or spark notes or whatever.
[585.99s -> 591.59s]  I just wrote a paper about just, it was just a bunch of vague shit that I said about the book.
[594.54s -> 597.66s]  I got a D, but I passed it.
[597.66s -> 599.82s]  I got a D on that, it was like a D plus.
[601.16s -> 604.92s]  And there was a shit load of red ink circled being like, what do you mean by this?
[606.71s -> 610.15s]  I think the teacher might've like felt bad that like I just couldn't,
[610.15s -> 611.59s]  I didn't fucking get it or something.
[613.43s -> 618.79s]  But I wrote an entire paper, like a, like an eight to 10 page paper on a book I did not read.
[620.02s -> 621.06s]  Don't fucking do that.
[621.06s -> 621.86s]  Don't be an idiot.
[621.86s -> 624.34s]  Like that, that take that stuff seriously.
[625.14s -> 628.87s]  But to be fair, the stuff that in school that I did take seriously that I cared about,
[628.87s -> 629.99s]  I took very seriously.
[633.11s -> 634.15s]  Eight to 10.
[634.15s -> 640.44s]  I was just like a vague kind of anecdotal random stuff about like how I felt about the book.
[641.24s -> 645.93s]  What classes did you take seriously?
[645.93s -> 647.05s]  I thought science was really cool.
[647.85s -> 649.13s]  I always paid attention in science.
[651.45s -> 652.01s]  Math?
[652.01s -> 653.61s]  No, I couldn't do it.
[653.61s -> 654.65s]  I was, I just couldn't do it.
[655.75s -> 659.11s]  I did enough where I could pass the classes and like, you know, whatever, do the worksheets
[659.11s -> 663.43s]  and try to get at least like pass in grade plus C whatever on the test, whatever.
[664.23s -> 665.99s]  But I was, I loved science.
[667.46s -> 668.58s]  I was, I thought it was great.
[670.07s -> 670.63s]  Bat chest.
[671.98s -> 674.06s]  Don't bat chest me because I like science.
[674.06s -> 676.70s]  I, that's not, okay, it's fine.
[679.05s -> 680.49s]  Oh, I love science.
[680.49s -> 681.13s]  Bat chest.
[685.42s -> 685.82s]  All right.
[685.82s -> 686.22s]  All right.
[686.22s -> 686.54s]  All right.
[688.06s -> 688.86s]  Okay.
[688.86s -> 691.19s]  We're gonna play Wobble Dogs.
[694.76s -> 696.76s]  Um, what else did I like in high school?
[697.56s -> 701.83s]  I thought, uh, you know what?
[701.83s -> 702.79s]  I liked logic.
[702.79s -> 703.91s]  I thought logic was really cool.
[704.95s -> 709.19s]  Like if, then, therefore, it was like a math problem with language, with words.
[709.19s -> 710.63s]  It was really actually kind of cool.
[710.63s -> 711.75s]  Logic was actually really cool.
[712.71s -> 714.95s]  If you have an opportunity to take, and I'm not fucking around.
[714.95s -> 715.75s]  This is not a joke.
[716.31s -> 719.43s]  If you're in high school or if you're going into college or if you're in college right now,
[720.57s -> 722.73s]  if logic is available, take it.
[722.73s -> 723.77s]  It's really cool.
[728.87s -> 734.39s]  It's, it's called logic and it's based on, it's like a math problem with words.
[737.69s -> 738.41s]  I loved it.
[739.13s -> 741.37s]  No, not logitech.
[744.25s -> 745.37s]  That's just philosophy.
[746.52s -> 751.96s]  No, but it's, it's like a math problem version of like, just look it up.
[751.96s -> 755.08s]  Just look up like logic class or logic math.
[755.08s -> 755.88s]  You'll see.
[755.96s -> 757.00s]  It's really interesting.
[757.00s -> 758.28s]  Please take it if you have an opportunity.
[758.28s -> 759.72s]  It'll, it'll open your mind, if it will.
[761.30s -> 762.74s]  I hecking love logitech.
[764.97s -> 765.93s]  Why did I just read that?
[765.93s -> 767.29s]  Because I thought, whatever.
[767.29s -> 770.09s]  I actually, besides, I'm not gonna, don't say anything.
[774.49s -> 777.83s]  I, shut up, everybody, quiet.
[779.02s -> 781.02s]  I actually, that company that makes some pretty good stuff.
[781.02s -> 782.14s]  I've used it before.
[782.70s -> 785.46s]  Except the, the webcams I have a problem with.
[785.46s -> 786.10s]  But that's it.
[786.10s -> 787.46s]  I only have a problem with their webcams.
[788.02s -> 788.82s]  That's it.
[788.82s -> 791.80s]  Just everybody relax.
[795.35s -> 796.23s]  That's programming?
[797.22s -> 798.18s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[798.18s -> 798.42s]  Hold on.
[798.42s -> 799.22s]  Let me get an example.
[799.78s -> 801.62s]  Like a logic example.
[801.62s -> 804.10s]  Logic class example.
[804.98s -> 805.86s]  We're learning today.
[810.07s -> 812.25s]  Crash course in formal logic.
[812.25s -> 814.55s]  Logic 101, introduction.
[814.55s -> 815.35s]  Introduction to logic.
[815.35s -> 816.71s]  Yeah, just fucking go learn.
[816.71s -> 819.03s]  I don't, just turn, turn the stream off right now.
[819.03s -> 820.42s]  I'm not doing it.
[820.42s -> 821.54s]  Just go learn yourself.
[821.54s -> 822.10s]  It's interesting.
[822.66s -> 825.46s]  It's like if, that's, then for, then why.
[825.46s -> 829.30s]  It's, it's like a programming math language problem.
[829.30s -> 830.26s]  Just go read.
[830.26s -> 831.14s]  Go fucking learn.
[831.70s -> 832.26s]  Don't come here.
[832.26s -> 833.30s]  I'm playing a dog game.
[833.30s -> 834.26s]  You shouldn't even be here right now.
[834.26s -> 835.38s]  You should be in fucking school.
[835.94s -> 837.27s]  What time is it?
[837.27s -> 845.83s]  You should be studying for tomorrow's exam.
[845.83s -> 846.31s]  My name is...
[847.59s -> 854.34s]  I don't know.
[854.34s -> 855.86s]  I don't even like using my name.
[855.86s -> 858.39s]  I'm 36, dude.
[858.39s -> 859.27s]  I don't have exams.
[861.27s -> 862.39s]  Yeah, but just trust me.
[862.39s -> 863.19s]  Take a logic class.
[863.19s -> 864.47s]  I know people will be like, oh my God.
[864.47s -> 866.63s]  I like the logic bad chest Andy.
[866.63s -> 867.35s]  Whatever.
[867.35s -> 867.75s]  It's cool.
[869.11s -> 870.07s]  How about macho?
[870.79s -> 873.13s]  All right.
[873.13s -> 873.85s]  So how does this game work?
[874.49s -> 876.44s]  Welcome to Wobble Dogs.
[876.44s -> 880.44s]  This is a sandbox game where you can raise your own little hive of mutated pups.
[880.52s -> 890.84s]  Let's go over a few basic concepts before we turn you loose.
[890.84s -> 893.42s]  Let's go ahead and get you with a dog to play with.
[893.42s -> 896.18s]  I gotta move the can.
[897.13s -> 898.73s]  My dog's name is Mingle.
[899.29s -> 900.01s]  Fresh dog.
[900.01s -> 905.18s]  Hold on.
[905.18s -> 905.66s]  Dog.
[905.66s -> 906.38s]  Buddy.
[906.38s -> 906.70s]  Stub.
[906.70s -> 907.10s]  Do we need to...
[907.10s -> 907.26s]  Oh no.
[907.26s -> 907.58s]  We gotta...
[907.58s -> 908.22s]  Come on.
[908.22s -> 911.14s]  Bandit.
[911.14s -> 913.34s]  Congratulations on your new pup.
[913.34s -> 916.78s]  Now that you have got a dog, let's learn about the dog storage screen.
[916.78s -> 922.66s]  This gives you an overview of all the dogs you own and lets you choose which ones are
[922.66s -> 923.94s]  in the world at any given time.
[924.50s -> 929.74s]  If a dog ever accidentally ends up being removed from the world, this is where it'll end up.
[929.74s -> 932.70s]  Okay, so I have like a dog storage.
[932.70s -> 937.08s]  How come there's no auto-emote?
[937.08s -> 937.58s]  I think there is.
[938.28s -> 943.88s]  If being born is hungry work, build a food dispenser and use it to feed your new pup.
[943.88s -> 946.23s]  Classic food dispenser.
[946.23s -> 946.79s]  All right.
[946.79s -> 949.77s]  Build.
[949.77s -> 956.18s]  You guys gotta love this game.
[956.18s -> 956.98s]  I already know it.
[956.98s -> 959.24s]  Okay, so this is...
[959.24s -> 960.04s]  You gotta go to the fence.
[961.03s -> 963.03s]  Feed your dog's a healthy treat.
[963.03s -> 964.63s]  Where should I put it?
[964.63s -> 968.07s]  Are we in the corner here?
[968.07s -> 970.74s]  Does this cost money or is it just free?
[970.74s -> 975.34s]  Your dog will try to feed itself, but if you click on a piece of food,
[975.34s -> 976.94s]  you can command your dog to eat it.
[976.94s -> 979.66s]  You can also grab things to drag them around.
[979.66s -> 983.54s]  Use the scroll wheel or hold control to drag them vertically.
[983.54s -> 984.18s]  Okay.
[984.18s -> 986.62s]  Feed your dog.
[986.62s -> 989.59s]  So it's kind of...
[989.59s -> 990.63s]  This is like The Sims.
[990.63s -> 993.43s]  Get over there.
[996.41s -> 998.57s]  Nutritional pellet of burrito?
[998.57s -> 999.45s]  French fries?
[999.45s -> 1000.58s]  What?
[1000.58s -> 1002.74s]  Dogs love to munch on this nutritious pellet.
[1002.74s -> 1004.82s]  Looks like someone's already taken a bite.
[1004.82s -> 1009.50s]  Wait, you get it?
[1009.50s -> 1011.11s]  Press the button.
[1011.11s -> 1017.50s]  This dog's eating burritos.
[1017.50s -> 1020.14s]  It looks like your pup's ready to pupate.
[1020.14s -> 1023.37s]  Press the pupate?
[1023.37s -> 1025.75s]  Also, if you haven't figured it out yet, you have to move the camera.
[1026.31s -> 1029.56s]  Help your dog pupate.
[1029.56s -> 1031.16s]  How do I get rid of this?
[1031.80s -> 1036.28s]  Oh, I gotta get rid of this.
[1036.28s -> 1037.48s]  Uh, are you all right?
[1037.48s -> 1038.63s]  What happened?
[1038.63s -> 1041.19s]  What is going on?
[1042.23s -> 1043.59s]  Why does he have a burrito in his mouth?
[1043.59s -> 1045.43s]  I had two burritos?
[1045.43s -> 1053.08s]  Okay, how do I pupate?
[1053.08s -> 1055.32s]  Not flora field guide?
[1055.32s -> 1058.07s]  What the fuck?
[1058.07s -> 1063.72s]  Standard flora found in nearly all dog-based life forms.
[1063.72s -> 1067.64s]  Beneficial flora often used to help acclimate dogs to cold weather climates.
[1067.64s -> 1074.31s]  Oh, I get this from eating a burrito?
[1074.31s -> 1075.19s]  All right, enough.
[1075.19s -> 1080.84s]  This dog is fucked up.
[1080.84s -> 1082.68s]  Okay, well, how do I pupate?
[1082.68s -> 1084.12s]  Help your dog pupate.
[1084.12s -> 1088.46s]  Okay, pupate.
[1088.46s -> 1088.86s]  What?
[1088.86s -> 1098.81s]  This is weird.
[1098.81s -> 1103.08s]  Oh, not on the burrito.
[1103.08s -> 1104.04s]  Don't eat those.
[1104.04s -> 1106.46s]  Ugh.
[1106.46s -> 1109.40s]  This is kind of gross.
[1109.40s -> 1113.70s]  Okay, mutations.
[1113.70s -> 1115.99s]  Back leg stance width.
[1115.99s -> 1126.90s]  Body girth went up and nose and ear gloss went up a lot.
[1126.90s -> 1127.54s]  All right.
[1127.54s -> 1132.65s]  Dogs pupate several times throughout their lives.
[1132.65s -> 1134.89s]  The foods they eat will influence their mutations.
[1134.89s -> 1140.84s]  Let's have you build an incubator that you hatch fertilized dog eggs.
[1140.84s -> 1141.64s]  Don't eat that.
[1141.64s -> 1145.78s]  Oh, something's wrong.
[1145.78s -> 1146.74s]  He's freaking out.
[1146.74s -> 1151.10s]  Okay, incubator.
[1151.10s -> 1154.22s]  He like ate his casing and is losing his mind.
[1154.22s -> 1156.06s]  Okay, incubator.
[1156.06s -> 1163.85s]  What's over here?
[1163.85s -> 1165.77s]  Even though you don't own any fertilized dog eggs,
[1165.77s -> 1170.10s]  the incubator always lets you hatch a dog with default genetics.
[1170.10s -> 1171.46s]  How do I clean shit up here?
[1171.46s -> 1174.20s]  Oh, there we go.
[1174.20s -> 1180.06s]  This thing, this burrito, is this burrito like dirty?
[1180.06s -> 1182.22s]  Okay, well, let's have a fertilized egg.
[1182.22s -> 1186.36s]  What is going on here?
[1186.36s -> 1188.58s]  This is, oh, this is Bandit's gut.
[1188.58s -> 1191.86s]  This is weird.
[1191.86s -> 1194.97s]  Okay, so hatch this egg.
[1194.97s -> 1195.69s]  Here's another dog.
[1196.62s -> 1197.26s]  I like mud.
[1197.26s -> 1198.87s]  Mud's great already.
[1198.87s -> 1199.75s]  If you're holding an object,
[1199.75s -> 1201.91s]  you can press the delete key on your keyboard to destroy it.
[1201.91s -> 1202.31s]  Thank you.
[1203.05s -> 1205.13s]  This works on dogs too, but don't worry, they'll be okay.
[1206.23s -> 1207.43s]  Last up, don't forget to save often.
[1207.43s -> 1210.15s]  The game only autosaves when you travel to breeding mode.
[1211.02s -> 1211.90s]  Breeding mode.
[1211.90s -> 1216.73s]  Lay around and have fun.
[1217.69s -> 1221.14s]  God, okay.
[1221.14s -> 1225.06s]  So let's, let's, let's, you want a burrito?
[1225.06s -> 1226.68s]  No, I don't want you to eat a burrito.
[1228.02s -> 1230.10s]  I want like a nutritional, French fries.
[1230.10s -> 1239.00s]  Go eat a French fry.
[1239.00s -> 1244.98s]  Here, try this.
[1244.98s -> 1245.62s]  Eat that.
[1245.62s -> 1252.82s]  Eat that French fry.
[1252.82s -> 1256.70s]  Eat this.
[1256.70s -> 1257.82s]  Go eat the French fry.
[1257.82s -> 1258.86s]  What are you, stupid?
[1258.86s -> 1264.34s]  Where are you going?
[1264.34s -> 1266.65s]  Oh, he's not hungry.
[1266.65s -> 1271.16s]  If you press that button, I'm going to be very upset.
[1271.16s -> 1273.43s]  Oh wait, here comes Bandit.
[1273.43s -> 1276.17s]  Bandit's going to eat the French fry.
[1276.17s -> 1283.16s]  Are you going to eat the French fry?
[1283.16s -> 1286.50s]  Okay, so that changed your gut flora.
[1289.93s -> 1293.78s]  Oh, let's, um, good, good dog.
[1293.78s -> 1296.26s]  Click mud, then eat French fry.
[1296.26s -> 1297.14s]  I don't think they really need it.
[1297.14s -> 1298.34s]  All right, what about, uh, what's this?
[1298.34s -> 1301.86s]  Currences.
[1301.86s -> 1303.62s]  A flora found in cocoon drippings.
[1303.62s -> 1304.66s]  So what does this do?
[1304.66s -> 1306.58s]  I don't know.
[1306.58s -> 1307.70s]  It doesn't, I don't know yet.
[1307.70s -> 1313.99s]  But it turns dogs into like French fries?
[1313.99s -> 1317.67s]  Default collaboration.
[1317.67s -> 1319.03s]  This, this is like, unlocks a ton of shit.
[1319.03s -> 1320.15s]  This is like, kind of seems ridiculous.
[1320.15s -> 1321.51s]  All right.
[1321.51s -> 1325.30s]  Oh, do I get more dogs?
[1325.30s -> 1328.73s]  All right, you come over here.
[1331.16s -> 1332.36s]  Okay, I thought someone's going to eat it.
[1332.36s -> 1333.72s]  I was like, someone's going to eat that immediately.
[1333.72s -> 1335.24s]  That's, I don't know why they freaked me out.
[1335.24s -> 1339.08s]  What do I do with this?
[1339.08s -> 1340.12s]  It is edible, by the way.
[1346.18s -> 1349.78s]  Randy is waiting for you in storage.
[1349.78s -> 1354.17s]  And you get, you can feed with chicken nuggets now.
[1354.17s -> 1355.29s]  All right, let's go get Randy.
[1355.29s -> 1362.79s]  What the fuck is that?
[1362.79s -> 1365.21s]  Okay.
[1365.21s -> 1369.56s]  Oh, that's funny.
[1370.68s -> 1372.44s]  It's like, I don't know what the fuck that was.
[1372.44s -> 1375.05s]  That's genetic code?
[1375.05s -> 1376.09s]  Oh, release, spring out.
[1376.09s -> 1376.57s]  Okay.
[1376.57s -> 1378.60s]  It's DNA?
[1379.46s -> 1382.66s]  Hey, hey, why is it blood?
[1382.66s -> 1388.58s]  Okay, for a second, I thought Bandit was fucking eating mud.
[1388.58s -> 1390.46s]  What does this do?
[1390.46s -> 1393.02s]  Hey, stop that.
[1393.02s -> 1393.82s]  Stop doing that.
[1393.82s -> 1394.86s]  Please don't do that.
[1394.86s -> 1395.50s]  What was that?
[1395.50s -> 1396.54s]  That was weird.
[1396.54s -> 1403.98s]  Okay, relax.
[1403.98s -> 1406.44s]  Randy, sit.
[1408.14s -> 1410.68s]  I'm trying my best to sit.
[1410.68s -> 1411.48s]  Very good.
[1411.48s -> 1412.44s]  Very, very good.
[1412.44s -> 1413.32s]  Good dog.
[1413.32s -> 1419.90s]  So what can I do with the dirt?
[1419.90s -> 1421.18s]  Anybody want a burrito?
[1421.18s -> 1423.75s]  Just shit on an egg?
[1423.75s -> 1427.30s]  There's a dog egg in here.
[1427.30s -> 1438.71s]  Why is there, what happened?
[1438.71s -> 1440.94s]  Looks like you found an unfertilized egg.
[1440.94s -> 1444.70s]  You can use the breeding simulation to inject these with dog genes.
[1444.70s -> 1454.44s]  Just breed any two of your adult dogs
[1454.44s -> 1456.76s]  and inject the resultant genes into an egg.
[1456.76s -> 1459.00s]  Afterwards, you can hatch this egg and use the incubator.
[1459.00s -> 1461.60s]  Okay.
[1469.70s -> 1470.18s]  Okay.
[1470.18s -> 1478.79s]  So Randy and Bandit.
[1478.79s -> 1480.95s]  Are you sure you'd like to breed the selected dogs
[1480.95s -> 1483.11s]  and immediately remove an egg from your inventory?
[1484.38s -> 1490.60s]  Yeah.
[1490.60s -> 1491.16s]  What?
[1491.16s -> 1494.04s]  Crossbreed or select final dog?
[1495.67s -> 1496.07s]  I don't know.
[1498.07s -> 1498.47s]  I don't get it.
[1498.47s -> 1498.87s]  What do I do?
[1499.43s -> 1504.02s]  Should I select final?
[1504.58s -> 1505.78s]  Just crossbreed them.
[1508.66s -> 1510.98s]  I don't know who's, I don't know who's got,
[1512.02s -> 1513.38s]  they're all like, look, what do I do?
[1514.42s -> 1515.46s]  Dog A and dog B.
[1516.18s -> 1519.08s]  What is happening?
[1527.00s -> 1527.64s]  Whoa.
[1527.64s -> 1530.23s]  Oh, they do have different eyes and mouths and stuff.
[1530.23s -> 1534.49s]  You're right.
[1534.49s -> 1534.81s]  All right.
[1534.81s -> 1539.91s]  Crossbreed you and one that's really jumping around.
[1540.47s -> 1544.90s]  Holy shit.
[1544.90s -> 1546.58s]  That, that, I want this one jumps.
[1549.46s -> 1549.94s]  Okay.
[1549.94s -> 1551.94s]  We got to, okay, final dog here.
[1551.94s -> 1553.13s]  What do we want?
[1553.69s -> 1558.20s]  Who has the most energy?
[1558.20s -> 1559.88s]  Is that, should we not have the dog with the most energy?
[1561.43s -> 1562.23s]  Keep going?
[1570.54s -> 1574.55s]  I want the dog with, all right, one more and that's it.
[1577.38s -> 1579.14s]  You, you can stand.
[1579.14s -> 1579.70s]  Holy shit.
[1579.70s -> 1580.18s]  Look at that.
[1580.18s -> 1580.66s]  Look at this.
[1585.53s -> 1585.85s]  All right.
[1585.85s -> 1586.17s]  All right.
[1586.17s -> 1586.41s]  All right.
[1586.41s -> 1586.65s]  All right.
[1586.65s -> 1586.89s]  All right.
[1586.89s -> 1587.21s]  That's enough.
[1587.21s -> 1588.09s]  That's enough.
[1588.09s -> 1588.49s]  This one.
[1589.21s -> 1590.33s]  It's like final dog.
[1590.33s -> 1591.29s]  It's going to pick one from here.
[1591.93s -> 1596.04s]  That was pretty sick.
[1597.16s -> 1598.52s]  Can anybody else do anything like that?
[1599.16s -> 1603.37s]  No, I think it's going to be you.
[1620.97s -> 1622.41s]  Rune generation complete.
[1622.97s -> 1625.34s]  The hell is going on in this game?
[1625.34s -> 1628.39s]  That's got like a Mega Man password.
[1628.39s -> 1652.20s]  This is a very elaborate thing going on.
[1663.03s -> 1665.45s]  Hey, holy shit.
[1665.45s -> 1666.81s]  This is like kind of terrible.
[1667.45s -> 1670.60s]  This is so scary.
[1671.24s -> 1674.39s]  Okay.
[1674.39s -> 1675.75s]  Fertilized egg acquired.
[1675.75s -> 1679.45s]  It's like weird sacrifice.
[1680.71s -> 1681.03s]  All right.
[1682.30s -> 1683.02s]  Dig a hole.
[1683.02s -> 1684.06s]  I get weed mix.
[1686.71s -> 1687.43s]  Egg novice.
[1687.43s -> 1688.63s]  I get cloud wallpaper.
[1688.63s -> 1688.87s]  Sick.
[1689.51s -> 1690.95s]  We need a pair of dogs for the first time.
[1691.51s -> 1692.15s]  I get another day.
[1692.15s -> 1692.87s]  I got another dog egg.
[1692.87s -> 1693.03s]  All right.
[1693.03s -> 1693.75s]  We're going to hold on to that.
[1694.76s -> 1696.12s]  I don't want to use that right now.
[1696.12s -> 1700.30s]  Wait, I can plant a seed in here.
[1701.77s -> 1702.33s]  Seed packets.
[1702.33s -> 1702.65s]  Let's go.
[1703.82s -> 1704.30s]  Oh shit.
[1707.51s -> 1708.47s]  Outdoor flooring.
[1711.64s -> 1711.96s]  All right.
[1711.96s -> 1712.28s]  Okay.
[1712.28s -> 1712.44s]  Okay.
[1712.44s -> 1712.52s]  Okay.
[1712.52s -> 1713.00s]  What is this?
[1717.03s -> 1717.43s]  Give me this.
[1718.90s -> 1719.94s]  Where'd you get this?
[1719.94s -> 1721.50s]  There's a prize inside?
[1722.23s -> 1723.11s]  Somebody come get this.
[1725.13s -> 1726.25s]  Hey, mud.
[1727.18s -> 1728.38s]  Come go over here and get this.
[1728.38s -> 1728.94s]  Where's mud?
[1730.18s -> 1730.90s]  They're getting hungry.
[1730.90s -> 1731.14s]  All right.
[1731.14s -> 1731.94s]  Mud, mud, mud.
[1731.94s -> 1732.34s]  Open that.
[1735.13s -> 1737.96s]  Star hologram?
[1737.96s -> 1738.68s]  I have to get it.
[1738.68s -> 1738.92s]  Oh.
[1741.77s -> 1743.21s]  Mud's going for the burrito.
[1743.21s -> 1743.93s]  Perfect.
[1743.93s -> 1753.34s]  Where's our other dog?
[1753.34s -> 1762.73s]  Oh, here we go.
[1762.73s -> 1766.36s]  Loot box.
[1766.36s -> 1767.94s]  Hey, don't fight.
[1767.94s -> 1768.74s]  What was that?
[1768.74s -> 1772.95s]  All right.
[1772.95s -> 1774.79s]  I got to feed some chicken nuggets
[1774.79s -> 1778.25s]  because that'll give us more DNA, right?
[1778.25s -> 1779.05s]  Look at mud.
[1779.05s -> 1779.85s]  You're so cute.
[1779.85s -> 1784.62s]  I'm getting just achievements every five seconds here.
[1784.62s -> 1784.86s]  All right.
[1784.86s -> 1786.70s]  I get blue blanket flowers.
[1786.70s -> 1790.26s]  Is this ready?
[1790.26s -> 1790.90s]  All right.
[1790.90s -> 1792.52s]  There's the dog with the square eye.
[1794.84s -> 1802.74s]  Um, how about squarie?
[1802.74s -> 1803.54s]  Squarie.
[1803.54s -> 1811.10s]  You got a lot of flowers here.
[1811.10s -> 1811.34s]  Okay.
[1811.34s -> 1811.90s]  All right.
[1811.90s -> 1814.18s]  Let me, I got to clean this place up a little bit.
[1814.18s -> 1815.86s]  This place is kind of a fucking dump.
[1815.86s -> 1817.40s]  Okay.
[1817.40s -> 1819.24s]  Loves to make loud noise.
[1819.24s -> 1820.84s]  The very picture of consideration.
[1820.84s -> 1823.26s]  Just wonderful, polite and aloof.
[1823.26s -> 1825.64s]  Who's the one we just, we just came up with?
[1825.64s -> 1825.88s]  Okay.
[1826.60s -> 1828.87s]  Squarie.
[1828.87s -> 1829.11s]  All right.
[1829.11s -> 1829.43s]  Stop.
[1829.43s -> 1830.15s]  Are you going to dig?
[1830.15s -> 1831.35s]  Are you going to bury the burrito?
[1831.35s -> 1832.63s]  This is going to be the cutest thing I've ever seen.
[1832.63s -> 1833.83s]  If you, if you bury the burrito,
[1833.83s -> 1835.30s]  then you're my favorite.
[1835.30s -> 1836.18s]  Bury the burrito.
[1836.18s -> 1836.74s]  Do it.
[1836.74s -> 1838.42s]  Come on.
[1838.42s -> 1839.54s]  Bury the burrito.
[1839.54s -> 1845.61s]  Hey, that's not bad.
[1845.61s -> 1846.65s]  That's not yours.
[1846.65s -> 1847.98s]  That's not yours.
[1847.98s -> 1848.62s]  Stop it.
[1848.62s -> 1849.96s]  Hey.
[1849.96s -> 1854.26s]  Bandit.
[1854.26s -> 1855.69s]  Sit down.
[1855.69s -> 1860.47s]  Bandit, sit.
[1860.47s -> 1861.03s]  All right.
[1861.03s -> 1861.59s]  People are hungry.
[1861.59s -> 1861.83s]  Let's dig.
[1861.83s -> 1863.27s]  Let's get some chicken nuggets.
[1863.27s -> 1868.78s]  Chicken nuggets and nutritional pellet.
[1868.78s -> 1870.47s]  All right.
[1870.47s -> 1871.51s]  Come get the food.
[1871.51s -> 1879.98s]  Food's here.
[1879.98s -> 1884.46s]  The mouse sensitivity is really high.
[1884.46s -> 1885.18s]  I'm sorry.
[1885.18s -> 1886.87s]  All right.
[1886.87s -> 1887.51s]  Come eat.
[1887.51s -> 1891.24s]  No, don't pupate yet.
[1891.24s -> 1894.38s]  How come nobody's eating?
[1894.38s -> 1901.08s]  Oh, somebody took a bite out of this one.
[1901.08s -> 1905.34s]  This reminds me of a viva pinata,
[1905.34s -> 1907.26s]  but I kind of feel like there's more I can do.
[1907.26s -> 1908.82s]  At least in an immediate sense.
[1910.22s -> 1910.94s]  All right.
[1910.94s -> 1911.98s]  Go to get off.
[1911.98s -> 1915.69s]  But I don't know what they're doing.
[1915.69s -> 1916.57s]  All right.
[1916.57s -> 1917.29s]  Go pupate.
[1917.29s -> 1917.61s]  Wait.
[1917.61s -> 1918.41s]  You need to sleep.
[1918.41s -> 1919.45s]  Go to sleep first.
[1919.45s -> 1919.99s]  Go.
[1919.99s -> 1920.71s]  How do you make the dog?
[1920.71s -> 1922.23s]  How do you have the dog sleep?
[1922.23s -> 1923.45s]  I need a dog bed.
[1923.45s -> 1927.29s]  Where's this?
[1927.29s -> 1927.53s]  OK.
[1927.53s -> 1928.41s]  I need dog beds.
[1928.41s -> 1933.77s]  Decorations.
[1933.77s -> 1934.09s]  OK.
[1934.09s -> 1935.05s]  A star hologram.
[1935.05s -> 1936.81s]  Can go over here because it's kind of cool looking, I guess.
[1937.94s -> 1938.50s]  Toys.
[1938.50s -> 1939.85s]  Utilities.
[1939.85s -> 1940.41s]  Walls.
[1940.41s -> 1941.29s]  Where's a bed?
[1941.29s -> 1946.60s]  I like that.
[1946.60s -> 1952.47s]  How do I get a bed?
[1952.47s -> 1952.79s]  Whoa.
[1952.79s -> 1953.43s]  That was weird.
[1953.43s -> 1953.83s]  What?
[1953.83s -> 1955.03s]  Did I just delete everything?
[1955.03s -> 1955.99s]  I think I just deleted everything.
[1955.99s -> 1956.63s]  What happened?
[1956.63s -> 1957.99s]  Did I delete the game?
[1957.99s -> 1958.23s]  No.
[1958.23s -> 1959.03s]  I was like, holy shit.
[1959.03s -> 1959.91s]  What just happened?
[1959.91s -> 1962.87s]  OK.
[1962.87s -> 1967.93s]  How do I get out of this menu?
[1968.01s -> 1968.89s]  Cleaning time.
[1968.89s -> 1971.50s]  Oh, play pillow.
[1971.50s -> 1973.05s]  OK.
[1973.05s -> 1973.45s]  There you go.
[1973.45s -> 1974.09s]  Now you're sleeping.
[1974.09s -> 1974.65s]  All right.
[1974.65s -> 1975.29s]  You guys need to eat.
[1975.29s -> 1976.09s]  Who needs to eat?
[1976.09s -> 1976.65s]  Randy.
[1976.65s -> 1980.06s]  Eat this chicken nugget.
[1980.06s -> 1980.70s]  Bandit.
[1980.70s -> 1981.82s]  Eat this chicken nugget.
[1981.82s -> 1984.50s]  Squarrie.
[1984.50s -> 1985.46s]  Eat this pellet.
[1985.46s -> 1988.17s]  And then everybody go to bed.
[1988.17s -> 1992.31s]  There's another egg, too.
[1992.31s -> 1994.15s]  Yeah, I don't want to fertilize it yet until I...
[1994.15s -> 2000.55s]  I know you want to pupate so bad, but is that bad that you're mutate?
[2004.23s -> 2004.87s]  Oh, shit.
[2004.87s -> 2005.43s]  OK.
[2005.43s -> 2010.04s]  Just don't eat dirt.
[2010.04s -> 2011.24s]  Eat the chicken nugget that I gave you.
[2011.24s -> 2017.00s]  Why are you eating dirt?
[2017.00s -> 2017.40s]  Thank you.
[2017.40s -> 2017.64s]  All right.
[2017.64s -> 2017.88s]  Finally.
[2017.88s -> 2018.44s]  Here we go.
[2018.44s -> 2023.48s]  This place is a fucking mess.
[2023.48s -> 2029.11s]  I got to clean this place up.
[2029.11s -> 2029.91s]  OK.
[2029.91s -> 2032.47s]  So now maybe I'll be able to make another dog.
[2032.47s -> 2034.06s]  Oh, there's another egg.
[2034.06s -> 2034.30s]  OK.
[2034.30s -> 2037.06s]  Collect it.
[2037.06s -> 2041.24s]  Which of you hasn't eaten?
[2041.24s -> 2041.96s]  Randy.
[2041.96s -> 2043.32s]  Randy, you need to eat something.
[2043.32s -> 2043.48s]  Eat...
[2043.48s -> 2046.41s]  What do you like?
[2046.41s -> 2049.05s]  Energy easily forms positive connections with other dogs.
[2049.05s -> 2049.21s]  All right.
[2049.21s -> 2049.77s]  Just eat the burrito.
[2049.77s -> 2050.74s]  That's fine.
[2050.74s -> 2051.78s]  But eat something else, too.
[2051.78s -> 2055.53s]  You like a chicken nugget or something.
[2055.53s -> 2057.77s]  I'm trying my best to eat the chicken nugget.
[2057.77s -> 2062.28s]  OK.
[2062.28s -> 2062.68s]  This place...
[2062.68s -> 2063.56s]  This is a fucking mess.
[2063.56s -> 2064.20s]  Come on.
[2064.20s -> 2066.82s]  Do I have to water the plants?
[2067.94s -> 2068.66s]  Breed this.
[2068.66s -> 2069.54s]  Pet them with shift.
[2073.22s -> 2077.16s]  Oh, you can pet them.
[2077.16s -> 2077.88s]  Food.
[2077.88s -> 2089.10s]  Look at all these good dogs.
[2089.10s -> 2089.42s]  OK.
[2089.42s -> 2091.82s]  So you need to sleep.
[2091.82s -> 2095.34s]  Everyone's fed.
[2095.98s -> 2096.46s]  What is this?
[2096.46s -> 2096.62s]  OK.
[2096.62s -> 2097.26s]  There we go.
[2097.26s -> 2097.58s]  Hatch.
[2098.30s -> 2104.62s]  OK.
[2104.62s -> 2108.18s]  The body color changed a little.
[2110.46s -> 2111.74s]  Head size got bigger.
[2111.74s -> 2112.22s]  OK.
[2112.22s -> 2113.18s]  That's fine.
[2113.18s -> 2115.56s]  Yeah.
[2115.56s -> 2116.44s]  I don't want people eating this.
[2116.44s -> 2117.32s]  Get rid of this.
[2117.32s -> 2122.58s]  You're eating the flowers or are you peeing on the flowers?
[2122.58s -> 2126.33s]  Achievements.
[2128.76s -> 2129.56s]  Ham.
[2129.56s -> 2135.02s]  Hatch or mutate a dog with a very large head.
[2135.02s -> 2135.58s]  Phonograph.
[2136.70s -> 2138.58s]  All right.
[2138.58s -> 2138.98s]  Should I go?
[2138.98s -> 2139.46s]  Should I do some...
[2140.18s -> 2141.30s]  Oh, you want a pupae, too.
[2141.30s -> 2141.54s]  All right.
[2141.54s -> 2142.02s]  Go for it.
[2142.02s -> 2145.85s]  Let them sleep.
[2146.49s -> 2150.23s]  What's this one do?
[2150.23s -> 2154.26s]  This is from chicken nuggets.
[2154.26s -> 2155.22s]  Big brain dog.
[2158.01s -> 2160.63s]  My throat.
[2160.63s -> 2160.87s]  OK.
[2160.87s -> 2161.75s]  I have an egg.
[2161.75s -> 2162.07s]  I could...
[2162.07s -> 2162.87s]  Should I...
[2162.87s -> 2166.52s]  Oh, let's put that out here.
[2166.52s -> 2168.06s]  Foam ham.
[2168.06s -> 2168.54s]  Yeah, fine.
[2168.54s -> 2169.50s]  Somebody play with that.
[2169.50s -> 2171.64s]  Save the game.
[2172.28s -> 2174.55s]  OK.
[2174.55s -> 2181.98s]  We're good.
[2181.98s -> 2182.54s]  Fine.
[2182.54s -> 2184.17s]  Yeah, I'm fine.
[2184.17s -> 2184.41s]  All right.
[2184.41s -> 2188.18s]  Let's give her the dirt.
[2188.18s -> 2188.82s]  All right.
[2188.82s -> 2198.36s]  Come sleep in here.
[2198.36s -> 2200.36s]  Oh, a halved tree.
[2200.36s -> 2203.21s]  All right.
[2203.21s -> 2203.85s]  What do you got?
[2203.85s -> 2210.26s]  Squire is now...
[2210.26s -> 2214.47s]  Oh, he has a small head now.
[2214.47s -> 2215.19s]  OK.
[2215.19s -> 2216.95s]  Ears color is changing.
[2216.95s -> 2220.50s]  Front leg girth.
[2220.50s -> 2221.38s]  Body length.
[2221.38s -> 2223.56s]  His head is...
[2223.56s -> 2223.72s]  OK.
[2223.72s -> 2224.92s]  He got a little smaller.
[2224.92s -> 2225.88s]  Small brain.
[2228.01s -> 2229.05s]  Don't touch that.
[2229.05s -> 2231.85s]  Seriously, don't touch that.
[2231.85s -> 2232.41s]  No.
[2232.41s -> 2233.69s]  You need something healthy.
[2233.69s -> 2237.10s]  First of all, go like...
[2237.10s -> 2238.30s]  Go sleep in there.
[2238.30s -> 2239.96s]  Everyone's happy.
[2239.96s -> 2240.20s]  Good.
[2240.20s -> 2240.36s]  All right.
[2240.36s -> 2241.24s]  Who wants to play with this?
[2241.24s -> 2241.48s]  All right.
[2241.48s -> 2249.61s]  Delete this.
[2249.61s -> 2251.45s]  All right.
[2251.45s -> 2253.13s]  Let's make another one.
[2253.13s -> 2254.09s]  Let's do some breeding.
[2254.09s -> 2258.20s]  Where's the breeding menu?
[2258.20s -> 2262.44s]  How do I do that?
[2262.44s -> 2262.84s]  Oh, right here.
[2262.84s -> 2263.40s]  OK.
[2263.40s -> 2263.64s]  All right.
[2263.64s -> 2263.96s]  Here we go.
[2263.96s -> 2264.52s]  Ready?
[2264.52s -> 2269.82s]  Not old enough.
[2269.82s -> 2270.87s]  Oh, shit.
[2270.87s -> 2271.11s]  OK.
[2271.11s -> 2271.67s]  Never mind.
[2271.67s -> 2279.05s]  Try to make an abomination.
[2279.05s -> 2280.17s]  Oh, I want that.
[2280.17s -> 2283.77s]  Definitely.
[2286.84s -> 2287.88s]  Let's pet everybody first.
[2287.88s -> 2291.06s]  I want everyone to be happy.
[2291.06s -> 2297.78s]  OK.
[2297.78s -> 2298.42s]  Good.
[2298.42s -> 2300.12s]  Where's...
[2300.12s -> 2302.92s]  Oh, you're over here.
[2302.92s -> 2303.56s]  OK.
[2303.56s -> 2304.86s]  You're sleeping.
[2304.86s -> 2305.66s]  Is everybody hungry?
[2305.66s -> 2309.06s]  It's still french fries if somebody eat.
[2309.06s -> 2312.95s]  Make the ball pit.
[2312.95s -> 2313.59s]  Let me...
[2313.59s -> 2318.41s]  That's a little too much.
[2321.11s -> 2322.07s]  I like the clouds the most.
[2322.07s -> 2322.71s]  Clouds are the best.
[2326.65s -> 2327.05s]  I like that.
[2327.05s -> 2327.69s]  That's cool.
[2327.69s -> 2332.50s]  Maybe put a tree here so they can pee on it.
[2332.50s -> 2339.38s]  What about the phonograph?
[2339.38s -> 2344.92s]  I have more than one feeding thing.
[2344.92s -> 2345.48s]  What's going on?
[2345.48s -> 2346.22s]  Stop.
[2346.22s -> 2346.62s]  Stop it.
[2346.62s -> 2348.71s]  Hey.
[2348.71s -> 2350.07s]  There's dirt everywhere.
[2350.07s -> 2350.79s]  You can have...
[2350.79s -> 2351.51s]  All right.
[2351.51s -> 2352.49s]  Put it down.
[2352.49s -> 2353.13s]  Hey.
[2353.13s -> 2353.69s]  Look.
[2353.69s -> 2354.65s]  I have dirt right here.
[2354.65s -> 2355.64s]  See?
[2355.64s -> 2358.09s]  There's more than one.
[2358.09s -> 2359.26s]  Randy.
[2359.26s -> 2359.82s]  Look.
[2359.82s -> 2363.21s]  There's more than one dirt pellet.
[2363.21s -> 2363.77s]  Right here.
[2363.77s -> 2366.15s]  Go grab it.
[2366.15s -> 2366.71s]  See?
[2366.71s -> 2371.19s]  There's more than one.
[2371.19s -> 2372.55s]  Boy story Andy.
[2372.55s -> 2373.19s]  Please.
[2374.46s -> 2374.70s]  OK.
[2375.98s -> 2378.79s]  What should I feed?
[2378.79s -> 2383.29s]  Another chicken nugget?
[2383.29s -> 2384.25s]  I got to move this.
[2384.25s -> 2385.77s]  This is the shittiest spot.
[2385.77s -> 2386.97s]  I got to move that.
[2386.97s -> 2395.19s]  OK.
[2395.19s -> 2395.59s]  That's better.
[2395.59s -> 2397.67s]  Now I can actually collect the damn thing.
[2397.67s -> 2403.45s]  What the fuck was that?
[2403.45s -> 2404.09s]  You all right?
[2404.09s -> 2404.63s]  OK.
[2404.63s -> 2405.19s]  We're good.
[2405.19s -> 2409.94s]  Oh.
[2409.94s -> 2410.90s]  You're going for the chicken nugget.
[2410.90s -> 2414.95s]  This is a squary.
[2414.95s -> 2419.24s]  It's still a juvenile.
[2419.24s -> 2421.86s]  You like it?
[2421.86s -> 2425.59s]  You like it?
[2425.59s -> 2430.47s]  Like more seeds?
[2430.47s -> 2432.17s]  Yeah.
[2432.17s -> 2433.61s]  I don't want them to be all over the place though.
[2433.61s -> 2434.25s]  Like, OK.
[2434.25s -> 2434.89s]  You...
[2434.89s -> 2437.19s]  Let's put them like over here.
[2437.83s -> 2439.43s]  This dirt patch is so fucked up.
[2439.43s -> 2440.15s]  I don't want this.
[2440.15s -> 2440.79s]  It's kind of ugly.
[2442.70s -> 2442.86s]  All right.
[2442.86s -> 2443.82s]  I'm going to plant the...
[2443.82s -> 2445.93s]  How do I get rid of this?
[2445.93s -> 2453.08s]  This is a squid game room.
[2453.08s -> 2454.52s]  It's not a squid.
[2454.52s -> 2454.84s]  It's...
[2454.84s -> 2456.28s]  This is not squid game.
[2456.28s -> 2458.71s]  OK.
[2458.71s -> 2461.19s]  I want you to dig.
[2461.19s -> 2461.91s]  What is it?
[2461.91s -> 2465.67s]  Upgrade kit?
[2465.67s -> 2465.99s]  OK.
[2465.99s -> 2466.79s]  Dig here.
[2466.79s -> 2470.18s]  Oh, you're asleep.
[2470.18s -> 2470.50s]  Never mind.
[2470.50s -> 2470.82s]  All right.
[2470.82s -> 2471.46s]  You're awake.
[2471.46s -> 2477.38s]  Dig right here.
[2477.38s -> 2477.78s]  Oh, look.
[2477.78s -> 2478.34s]  You like the tree.
[2478.34s -> 2478.90s]  That's cool.
[2478.90s -> 2483.77s]  How you doing?
[2483.77s -> 2484.97s]  Just sitting by the tree.
[2484.97s -> 2489.93s]  You want a snack?
[2489.93s -> 2491.91s]  Kind of.
[2491.91s -> 2492.95s]  What do you like for food?
[2492.95s -> 2499.26s]  My throat is so fucked up.
[2499.26s -> 2499.82s]  I don't know why.
[2501.40s -> 2501.96s]  I wish I told...
[2501.96s -> 2503.00s]  I wish I could tell you.
[2503.00s -> 2506.47s]  You want that?
[2506.47s -> 2507.03s]  Have some.
[2507.03s -> 2509.80s]  It's been smoking too much.
[2509.80s -> 2510.04s]  No.
[2510.04s -> 2510.68s]  I just...
[2510.68s -> 2511.40s]  I'm fucked.
[2515.03s -> 2515.83s]  Weather fluctuations?
[2515.83s -> 2516.63s]  It really might be.
[2516.63s -> 2521.08s]  It's starting to become like 90 degrees here
[2521.08s -> 2521.96s]  and a lot of dust.
[2521.96s -> 2524.31s]  I got a filter though.
[2524.31s -> 2526.89s]  All right.
[2526.89s -> 2529.21s]  I'm going to take one quick silent...
[2529.21s -> 2530.31s]  Dispairing for a second.
[2530.31s -> 2531.27s]  I'm going to try to get rid of it.
[2531.27s -> 2545.13s]  Did anybody hear that?
[2545.13s -> 2545.85s]  I hope not.
[2545.85s -> 2548.50s]  Because that was fucking heinous.
[2549.94s -> 2550.90s]  Rotate the tree.
[2550.90s -> 2551.77s]  You got it.
[2551.77s -> 2564.79s]  All right.
[2564.79s -> 2565.75s]  Did you dig there yet?
[2565.75s -> 2566.07s]  Stop.
[2566.07s -> 2567.27s]  Don't eat your own shit.
[2567.27s -> 2568.07s]  Don't eat shit.
[2568.07s -> 2568.31s]  Stop.
[2568.31s -> 2568.55s]  Stop.
[2568.55s -> 2568.79s]  Stop.
[2568.79s -> 2568.87s]  Stop.
[2568.87s -> 2569.03s]  Stop.
[2569.03s -> 2569.19s]  No.
[2569.19s -> 2569.59s]  No.
[2571.61s -> 2574.25s]  Oh, now you're going to be all fucking mutated.
[2574.25s -> 2579.48s]  All right.
[2579.48s -> 2581.72s]  Stop.
[2581.72s -> 2582.28s]  What is it?
[2582.28s -> 2583.32s]  Toilet paper?
[2583.32s -> 2591.85s]  I want you to dig.
[2591.85s -> 2593.29s]  Why did you not dig over there?
[2593.29s -> 2597.45s]  Go play with this.
[2597.45s -> 2598.57s]  Go learn.
[2598.57s -> 2604.52s]  I need someone to dig over here.
[2604.52s -> 2610.82s]  Okay.
[2610.82s -> 2611.62s]  More seeds.
[2611.62s -> 2612.66s]  Very cool.
[2612.66s -> 2613.30s]  Eat poop.
[2614.78s -> 2616.38s]  Unlocks pizza bagel.
[2616.38s -> 2620.57s]  Why would eating your own shit unlock a bagel?
[2620.57s -> 2620.81s]  All right.
[2620.81s -> 2622.09s]  Everyone, people are getting hungry.
[2622.09s -> 2623.93s]  Should I just start putting out pizza bagels?
[2623.93s -> 2626.46s]  All right.
[2626.46s -> 2629.96s]  Dig right there.
[2629.96s -> 2631.32s]  And Randy.
[2631.32s -> 2635.58s]  Dig right here.
[2635.58s -> 2636.22s]  Very good.
[2636.22s -> 2639.98s]  It's a seedbed curse.
[2639.98s -> 2645.62s]  All right.
[2645.62s -> 2646.90s]  We're gonna start feeding pizza.
[2646.90s -> 2649.13s]  You've shitting so much.
[2649.13s -> 2657.30s]  Why you shit so much?
[2657.30s -> 2659.46s]  Hey.
[2659.46s -> 2660.98s]  Now you dig right here too.
[2660.98s -> 2661.86s]  Can you dig here?
[2661.86s -> 2664.60s]  Oh, what do you get?
[2664.60s -> 2665.00s]  Nice.
[2665.00s -> 2669.77s]  I don't know what just happened.
[2669.77s -> 2671.54s]  Okay.
[2671.54s -> 2675.46s]  Randy.
[2675.46s -> 2676.26s]  Right there.
[2676.26s -> 2680.65s]  I'm gonna plant some stuff here.
[2681.70s -> 2682.42s]  Don't delete the dirt.
[2682.42s -> 2682.90s]  Why not?
[2682.90s -> 2688.02s]  How do I do pizza bagel?
[2688.02s -> 2693.67s]  Is pizza bagel not in there?
[2693.67s -> 2697.85s]  How can I not move the...
[2699.48s -> 2699.80s]  What?
[2699.80s -> 2704.26s]  It's a different...
[2704.26s -> 2705.06s]  I did...
[2705.06s -> 2706.34s]  It's a different dispenser.
[2706.34s -> 2711.43s]  Oh, I got another pen.
[2711.43s -> 2714.71s]  How does that work?
[2714.71s -> 2719.02s]  You need to go to bed.
[2719.02s -> 2722.50s]  Okay.
[2722.50s -> 2723.86s]  Let's plant some seeds here.
[2723.86s -> 2730.54s]  Let's do blue flowers and golden lupine.
[2731.64s -> 2735.08s]  And daisies.
[2735.08s -> 2740.49s]  What are they doing?
[2740.49s -> 2742.09s]  Oh, they're eating food pellets.
[2742.09s -> 2742.65s]  Okay.
[2742.65s -> 2747.06s]  Stop fighting each other.
[2747.06s -> 2748.90s]  Blue flowers, red thorns.
[2748.90s -> 2750.10s]  Tell a joke already.
[2750.10s -> 2751.48s]  What would you like...
[2751.48s -> 2752.76s]  What material would you like me to do?
[2752.76s -> 2754.92s]  How about you...
[2754.92s -> 2756.76s]  How about you fucking relax?
[2756.76s -> 2765.21s]  It's a dollhouse?
[2765.21s -> 2765.69s]  Good one.
[2769.43s -> 2770.47s]  I just like felt that.
[2770.47s -> 2771.83s]  I like inhaled whatever that was.
[2773.34s -> 2775.10s]  How do I unlock the cheeseburger?
[2775.10s -> 2785.27s]  I don't like where this is.
[2785.27s -> 2786.23s]  I don't like this.
[2786.23s -> 2787.67s]  It's kind of...
[2787.67s -> 2790.92s]  It's in the way.
[2790.92s -> 2791.56s]  Isn't it?
[2791.56s -> 2800.65s]  It's in the way.
[2800.65s -> 2804.20s]  All right.
[2804.20s -> 2805.00s]  Everyone's doing okay.
[2805.00s -> 2805.24s]  What...
[2805.24s -> 2806.84s]  I have another pen.
[2806.84s -> 2810.84s]  Oh, you can...
[2810.84s -> 2811.08s]  Okay.
[2812.20s -> 2816.07s]  So if they eat the nutritional pellet,
[2816.07s -> 2817.91s]  they'll be orange.
[2817.91s -> 2819.56s]  Interesting.
[2819.56s -> 2820.82s]  Okay.
[2820.82s -> 2823.77s]  You lose a tooth?
[2823.77s -> 2825.91s]  Baby tooth?
[2825.91s -> 2826.71s]  They can eat this?
[2827.27s -> 2828.39s]  Why would they eat this?
[2828.39s -> 2829.91s]  Should somebody eat it?
[2829.91s -> 2837.26s]  I wonder what happened.
[2837.26s -> 2839.02s]  Maybe that'll like give them different properties.
[2839.02s -> 2839.90s]  Should you eat this?
[2839.90s -> 2841.35s]  All right.
[2841.35s -> 2845.96s]  Eat that.
[2845.96s -> 2846.36s]  You all right?
[2846.36s -> 2846.76s]  Was that...
[2846.76s -> 2851.13s]  Should I not have done that?
[2851.13s -> 2852.81s]  Whoa.
[2852.81s -> 2853.13s]  Okay.
[2853.13s -> 2853.93s]  I don't know what that does.
[2853.93s -> 2854.25s]  But all right.
[2854.25s -> 2859.46s]  We need to breed a squiry.
[2859.46s -> 2861.62s]  Stop doing that.
[2861.62s -> 2864.10s]  What the fuck?
[2864.10s -> 2867.35s]  Isn't this the...
[2867.35s -> 2867.59s]  Stop.
[2867.59s -> 2868.79s]  Don't dig up the flowers.
[2868.79s -> 2870.07s]  Stop digging up the flowers.
[2870.07s -> 2870.95s]  You're digging up the flowers.
[2870.95s -> 2871.75s]  You're being annoying.
[2872.63s -> 2873.75s]  They're digging the flowers up.
[2873.75s -> 2876.09s]  Get the cocoon.
[2876.09s -> 2895.02s]  Oh, you're ready.
[2895.02s -> 2895.66s]  Okay.
[2895.66s -> 2897.10s]  Got green ears now.
[2897.10s -> 2901.06s]  It got a little fatter.
[2901.06s -> 2902.02s]  A little longer.
[2902.02s -> 2903.22s]  It's no shrunk.
[2903.22s -> 2905.99s]  Interesting.
[2905.99s -> 2906.15s]  Okay.
[2906.15s -> 2906.79s]  What about you?
[2906.79s -> 2909.62s]  Who just did that?
[2909.62s -> 2917.46s]  They made like a Minecraft house?
[2917.46s -> 2920.23s]  That's kind of cool.
[2920.23s -> 2921.51s]  This game is...
[2921.51s -> 2922.55s]  This game's cute.
[2922.55s -> 2929.00s]  Mutation up.
[2929.00s -> 2935.24s]  The flowers are kind of just overgrowing here.
[2935.24s -> 2941.88s]  Article board?
[2941.88s -> 2951.78s]  Where is...
[2951.78s -> 2952.10s]  Okay.
[2952.10s -> 2952.74s]  Hatch.
[2952.74s -> 2958.02s]  What have we got?
[2958.02s -> 2959.46s]  Oh, green.
[2959.46s -> 2963.96s]  It's green with a little head.
[2963.96s -> 2968.89s]  Okay.
[2968.89s -> 2971.91s]  Cool.
[2971.91s -> 2973.03s]  I wonder what like...
[2973.03s -> 2974.71s]  How elaborate does this go?
[2974.71s -> 2977.86s]  Can I get a lullaby?
[2977.86s -> 2979.22s]  This is my first stream.
[2979.22s -> 2981.48s]  I was...
[2981.48s -> 2985.74s]  No.
[2985.74s -> 2989.56s]  Look inside.
[2989.56s -> 2992.65s]  Are you making this gold?
[2992.65s -> 2997.02s]  How do I...
[2997.02s -> 2997.66s]  What do I...
[2997.66s -> 2998.68s]  Expel?
[2998.68s -> 3004.94s]  What did I just do?
[3004.94s -> 3005.58s]  This gold.
[3005.58s -> 3007.98s]  They found gold and I just deleted it.
[3007.98s -> 3016.04s]  They're making a mineshaft.
[3016.68s -> 3029.14s]  Lullaby or riot?
[3029.14s -> 3029.78s]  No.
[3029.78s -> 3031.08s]  You guys are weird.
[3031.08s -> 3031.88s]  I'm not doing that.
[3031.88s -> 3032.84s]  That's weird.
[3032.84s -> 3036.38s]  I think we can do a...
[3037.58s -> 3038.86s]  We can do some breeding, right?
[3038.86s -> 3042.38s]  Is that possible?
[3042.38s -> 3043.08s]  No.
[3043.08s -> 3043.64s]  Not yet.
[3043.64s -> 3049.58s]  You get it as new.
[3049.58s -> 3050.22s]  Whatever that was.
[3051.78s -> 3052.98s]  You get it from eating dirt?
[3052.98s -> 3061.88s]  We need a bedtime.
[3071.83s -> 3072.39s]  No.
[3072.39s -> 3072.79s]  I...
[3072.79s -> 3073.51s]  I'm not doing it.
[3073.51s -> 3074.47s]  And this is not one of those like...
[3074.47s -> 3074.71s]  Chat!
[3074.71s -> 3075.51s]  I'm not gonna do the thing!
[3075.51s -> 3075.75s]  Chat!
[3075.75s -> 3076.23s]  I'm not gonna...
[3076.23s -> 3077.19s]  I'm not actually doing this.
[3077.19s -> 3077.59s]  That's weird.
[3079.45s -> 3079.69s]  All right.
[3079.69s -> 3080.25s]  Eat that.
[3080.25s -> 3080.73s]  Who's hungry?
[3080.73s -> 3081.69s]  Anybody still hungry?
[3081.69s -> 3084.55s]  Everybody needs to go to bed.
[3084.55s -> 3085.19s]  Right now.
[3085.19s -> 3097.37s]  Go to bed right now.
[3097.37s -> 3101.00s]  Bounce?
[3101.00s -> 3102.04s]  Like this little like...
[3102.04s -> 3103.32s]  Fucking giraffe.
[3103.32s -> 3104.20s]  Whatever it is.
[3104.20s -> 3105.19s]  You just get like...
[3105.19s -> 3107.11s]  They have like giraffe heads.
[3107.11s -> 3110.01s]  Oh!
[3110.01s -> 3110.89s]  You found dirt!
[3110.89s -> 3123.22s]  Good job.
[3123.22s -> 3124.82s]  Everybody go relax in bed.
[3124.82s -> 3127.67s]  Go...
[3127.67s -> 3132.73s]  Oh, we can upgrade the den.
[3132.73s -> 3133.69s]  Oh, shit.
[3133.69s -> 3136.47s]  This is a...
[3136.47s -> 3136.87s]  All right.
[3136.87s -> 3137.51s]  Somebody eat this.
[3139.46s -> 3140.26s]  Who do I want to eat this?
[3142.31s -> 3142.55s]  All right.
[3142.55s -> 3143.51s]  Let's have Squary do it.
[3143.51s -> 3144.55s]  Because Squary is already like...
[3144.55s -> 3145.27s]  I don't know.
[3145.27s -> 3147.03s]  Squary seems to have the most mutations.
[3147.03s -> 3149.54s]  Okay.
[3149.54s -> 3151.05s]  Eat that.
[3151.05s -> 3153.53s]  Eat that like clump of gold dirt.
[3153.53s -> 3161.30s]  This shit is gold.
[3161.30s -> 3167.66s]  Please import a fucked up dog.
[3168.22s -> 3173.27s]  Play white noise?
[3173.27s -> 3174.31s]  Dude, no!
[3174.31s -> 3175.99s]  I'm not playing white noise.
[3175.99s -> 3177.93s]  It's just the lighting.
[3177.93s -> 3178.17s]  It's...
[3178.17s -> 3179.05s]  Oh, okay.
[3179.05s -> 3183.14s]  Doggy bopper.
[3183.14s -> 3185.59s]  Destruct a den.
[3186.31s -> 3188.71s]  Oh, I got a jungle food dispenser.
[3188.71s -> 3192.52s]  And a dog biscuit.
[3192.52s -> 3192.92s]  All right.
[3192.92s -> 3193.32s]  Let's go.
[3194.81s -> 3196.89s]  I feel like this is gonna start to get really interesting here.
[3196.89s -> 3198.39s]  What do we got?
[3202.09s -> 3203.53s]  Above or below?
[3203.53s -> 3207.83s]  Probably right next to it.
[3207.83s -> 3210.97s]  Right here?
[3210.97s -> 3211.53s]  Oh, shit.
[3211.53s -> 3212.09s]  All right.
[3212.09s -> 3212.73s]  Nice.
[3212.73s -> 3213.50s]  Very nice.
[3213.50s -> 3213.82s]  Very nice.
[3213.82s -> 3215.96s]  Very nice.
[3215.96s -> 3216.52s]  I want...
[3217.24s -> 3218.76s]  Okay.
[3219.62s -> 3222.34s]  Ancient relic food dispenser?
[3224.17s -> 3224.81s]  That sounds cool.
[3227.40s -> 3227.72s]  Ooh.
[3230.84s -> 3231.96s]  Let's just get some of these out here.
[3232.76s -> 3236.63s]  Banana.
[3236.63s -> 3237.11s]  Coconut.
[3239.37s -> 3240.17s]  Cut fruit.
[3240.17s -> 3242.97s]  Squary, eat that.
[3242.97s -> 3245.18s]  Squary, go eat the banana.
[3245.18s -> 3247.94s]  And then...
[3247.94s -> 3250.50s]  What are they eating?
[3250.50s -> 3251.46s]  Oh, they're like...
[3251.46s -> 3254.18s]  They're sharing a delicious shit meal together.
[3254.66s -> 3263.10s]  What happens if you scold them?
[3263.10s -> 3263.88s]  I don't know.
[3264.76s -> 3267.70s]  Flowers are coming in.
[3267.70s -> 3269.85s]  All right.
[3269.85s -> 3270.97s]  Bandit, eat the coconut.
[3270.97s -> 3274.34s]  I wonder what you get from this.
[3274.34s -> 3279.16s]  Ooh.
[3279.16s -> 3280.60s]  Good, good, good, good, good, good.
[3280.60s -> 3281.40s]  That's a new death.
[3281.40s -> 3283.00s]  That's new genetics.
[3283.00s -> 3286.23s]  Okay.
[3286.23s -> 3286.63s]  I need...
[3287.67s -> 3293.48s]  Randy, go eat the cut fruit.
[3293.48s -> 3294.60s]  More mutations.
[3294.60s -> 3295.16s]  Go eat this.
[3295.72s -> 3297.00s]  Eat the coconut, actually.
[3297.00s -> 3301.05s]  Everybody doing all right?
[3301.05s -> 3302.41s]  You're not having a good time.
[3302.41s -> 3303.29s]  Here, come here.
[3303.29s -> 3308.97s]  This is the Sims LSD DLC.
[3308.97s -> 3314.58s]  Can you make them have a pink nose?
[3314.58s -> 3315.22s]  Maybe.
[3315.22s -> 3317.18s]  All right.
[3317.18s -> 3317.74s]  You need to eat something.
[3317.74s -> 3318.14s]  Come on out.
[3321.43s -> 3321.99s]  Come on here.
[3321.99s -> 3322.39s]  Come on out.
[3324.33s -> 3328.57s]  You okay?
[3328.57s -> 3329.29s]  Road carpet?
[3329.85s -> 3330.49s]  That's funny.
[3330.49s -> 3333.82s]  All right.
[3333.82s -> 3336.76s]  We have new mutations.
[3336.76s -> 3337.48s]  Don't know what they do.
[3337.48s -> 3341.13s]  They're just from eating shit.
[3341.13s -> 3341.61s]  All right.
[3341.61s -> 3344.41s]  I think we're almost time to breed.
[3344.41s -> 3351.96s]  Can I put them up with bananas?
[3351.96s -> 3355.16s]  How's everybody doing?
[3357.27s -> 3358.23s]  Randy, go to sleep now.
[3359.93s -> 3360.81s]  I can upgrade it again?
[3364.10s -> 3364.98s]  Randy, go to bed.
[3364.98s -> 3366.70s]  How come Randy's just sitting here?
[3366.70s -> 3372.44s]  Go sleep in the house.
[3372.44s -> 3372.92s]  Come on, Randy.
[3372.92s -> 3373.40s]  Get up.
[3373.40s -> 3382.90s]  Upgrade to the Spencer.
[3382.90s -> 3383.46s]  Can I?
[3383.46s -> 3387.35s]  I have to do it in the build...
[3387.35s -> 3388.63s]  My god, listen to me.
[3388.63s -> 3394.26s]  This is like the worst I think it's ever been.
[3394.26s -> 3394.84s]  It's been...
[3394.84s -> 3396.81s]  It's horrible right now.
[3396.81s -> 3397.05s]  All right.
[3397.05s -> 3397.45s]  He's sleeping.
[3397.45s -> 3404.60s]  That's good.
[3404.60s -> 3405.00s]  Clip.
[3405.00s -> 3405.48s]  Clip.
[3409.80s -> 3411.48s]  The Lich King was announced today.
[3411.48s -> 3413.08s]  Are you going to stream it when it launches?
[3413.08s -> 3413.48s]  No.
[3413.48s -> 3415.91s]  Streamer sings chat a lullaby.
[3455.22s -> 3456.74s]  I was shit-faced, okay?
[3456.74s -> 3461.54s]  What do you want me to say?
[3461.54s -> 3462.34s]  No, it's yours.
[3465.24s -> 3469.70s]  That was a Fortnite clip.
[3469.70s -> 3471.46s]  The end of this is what you wanted to watch.
[3475.77s -> 3479.61s]  I was shit-faced.
[3510.18s -> 3511.38s]  The POV.
[3511.38s -> 3512.02s]  God damn.
[3512.02s -> 3514.44s]  That's so fucking stupid.
[3514.44s -> 3517.27s]  Imagine if you looked like that.
[3517.27s -> 3517.59s]  That's...
[3518.31s -> 3520.71s]  All right.
[3520.71s -> 3521.59s]  Who didn't eat the...
[3521.59s -> 3522.63s]  Who didn't eat their...
[3522.63s -> 3523.91s]  Who didn't eat their whole dinner?
[3523.91s -> 3527.50s]  Their banana.
[3527.50s -> 3527.82s]  There.
[3527.82s -> 3528.70s]  This is your lullaby.
[3528.70s -> 3529.18s]  This is kind of...
[3529.18s -> 3530.78s]  This is just growing out of control here, I think.
[3534.79s -> 3536.31s]  Give us a lullaby and wipe away the debt.
[3536.31s -> 3536.95s]  No.
[3536.95s -> 3539.02s]  All right.
[3539.02s -> 3539.90s]  Squarie, play with this.
[3541.85s -> 3542.41s]  Go grab that.
[3542.97s -> 3544.86s]  Look at how everyone's having such a great time.
[3549.08s -> 3550.20s]  I still have two eggs that...
[3550.20s -> 3550.60s]  Okay.
[3550.60s -> 3551.00s]  I got to...
[3551.80s -> 3553.18s]  I'm probably going to put whatever...
[3553.18s -> 3553.58s]  I...
[3553.58s -> 3556.86s]  Whoever gets breeded here is going over here.
[3556.86s -> 3557.69s]  Because we're getting...
[3557.69s -> 3558.97s]  This is getting kind of crowded.
[3558.97s -> 3560.89s]  He's really rude today?
[3560.89s -> 3561.05s]  What?
[3561.05s -> 3561.77s]  What are you talking about?
[3561.77s -> 3562.01s]  What?
[3565.70s -> 3566.18s]  Rude?
[3566.18s -> 3567.54s]  How am I rude today?
[3567.54s -> 3567.94s]  What do you mean?
[3572.89s -> 3574.25s]  I got some other shit, didn't I?
[3574.25s -> 3574.49s]  All right.
[3574.49s -> 3574.89s]  Let me...
[3574.89s -> 3576.17s]  Let me prepare this place.
[3576.17s -> 3581.82s]  No, I don't like...
[3581.82s -> 3582.30s]  That looks...
[3582.30s -> 3583.50s]  That looks kind of scary.
[3584.22s -> 3584.46s]  All right.
[3584.46s -> 3585.90s]  This one's going to be the ball pit
[3585.90s -> 3589.83s]  with the starry background.
[3592.28s -> 3594.04s]  There'll be a doggy bopper in the corner.
[3598.89s -> 3599.85s]  We'll do this one in here.
[3603.05s -> 3603.85s]  And...
[3603.85s -> 3605.19s]  Okay.
[3605.19s -> 3606.15s]  This one's pretty much ready.
[3606.87s -> 3615.98s]  So when...
[3615.98s -> 3616.22s]  How...
[3616.22s -> 3617.42s]  When do you become adults?
[3619.00s -> 3620.36s]  Use the tubes to connect them?
[3622.41s -> 3622.81s]  Really?
[3623.45s -> 3625.88s]  It's like starting room.
[3629.91s -> 3630.95s]  Oh, shit!
[3630.95s -> 3631.51s]  That's cool.
[3631.51s -> 3631.83s]  All right.
[3635.06s -> 3635.46s]  They have...
[3635.54s -> 3637.06s]  Oh, they can go wherever they want now.
[3637.70s -> 3638.50s]  That's pretty cool.
[3643.08s -> 3643.96s]  What the fuck?
[3643.96s -> 3644.52s]  What just happened?
[3644.52s -> 3646.79s]  Are you all right?
[3646.79s -> 3647.59s]  Mud, what just happened?
[3648.63s -> 3649.99s]  Who just threw him?
[3649.99s -> 3656.28s]  We gotta get...
[3656.28s -> 3656.60s]  Hold on.
[3656.60s -> 3661.21s]  In here.
[3661.21s -> 3661.61s]  Oh!
[3662.81s -> 3663.13s]  What?
[3663.69s -> 3663.93s]  Okay.
[3665.18s -> 3666.46s]  I didn't know you could do that.
[3666.46s -> 3672.28s]  It has to be in this room, doesn't it?
[3672.28s -> 3673.38s]  All right.
[3673.38s -> 3675.42s]  We'll just delete it.
[3675.42s -> 3676.70s]  But I'm going to put that in here.
[3676.70s -> 3682.73s]  Oh, I have to...
[3682.73s -> 3682.89s]  Okay.
[3682.89s -> 3687.35s]  There's a big tree in the corner.
[3687.35s -> 3688.79s]  This...
[3688.79s -> 3689.83s]  Maybe this should be the playroom.
[3689.83s -> 3691.03s]  Should this be the playroom?
[3691.03s -> 3697.74s]  I think this is going to be the fun playroom.
[3697.74s -> 3699.80s]  I'm going to have like an eating...
[3699.80s -> 3701.32s]  A feeding room too, eventually.
[3701.32s -> 3705.93s]  Yeah, this would be like the fun room.
[3705.93s -> 3713.21s]  They want to like play with like toys and stuff.
[3713.21s -> 3713.85s]  They come in here.
[3713.85s -> 3719.14s]  Okay, because that's the balls on the ground.
[3719.14s -> 3719.46s]  Means...
[3720.02s -> 3720.26s]  Or...
[3720.90s -> 3721.94s]  Yeah, that's better.
[3721.94s -> 3725.14s]  I think the hot dog...
[3725.14s -> 3727.06s]  No, that's going to be the feeding room.
[3727.06s -> 3727.46s]  I like this.
[3727.46s -> 3728.10s]  This looks good.
[3730.68s -> 3731.56s]  Okay, cool.
[3731.56s -> 3733.18s]  All right.
[3733.18s -> 3734.14s]  Dev and Chat.
[3734.14s -> 3737.38s]  What's going on, Dev?
[3737.38s -> 3744.70s]  Big fan of your game.
[3744.70s -> 3745.66s]  Are you high?
[3745.66s -> 3750.10s]  They left.
[3750.10s -> 3751.54s]  Oh, side pupae.
[3751.54s -> 3755.05s]  All right.
[3755.05s -> 3755.77s]  This is going to be interesting.
[3755.77s -> 3761.91s]  Squary has eaten a coconut, a banana, and somebody else's shit.
[3761.91s -> 3768.89s]  So I wonder what's going to happen.
[3768.89s -> 3769.93s]  Oh, you're ready to go too.
[3772.18s -> 3776.06s]  Ooh, ooh.
[3776.06s -> 3777.61s]  You ready to go?
[3777.61s -> 3778.57s]  All right, let's go.
[3778.57s -> 3785.48s]  This is the moment here.
[3785.48s -> 3790.20s]  You've never seen a high person.
[3790.20s -> 3791.56s]  I wish he was high.
[3791.56s -> 3801.93s]  Yeah, I love how acting a little strange means on drugs, right?
[3801.93s -> 3803.93s]  Like you're on drugs.
[3803.93s -> 3805.98s]  What do we got?
[3805.98s -> 3817.03s]  This is Squary.
[3817.03s -> 3819.43s]  The only thing that really changed is he got a lot bigger.
[3823.62s -> 3824.26s]  Did you, though?
[3824.26s -> 3828.49s]  You look still kind of small.
[3828.49s -> 3829.21s]  Oh, no.
[3829.21s -> 3831.74s]  What's wrong?
[3831.74s -> 3836.25s]  Are you okay?
[3836.25s -> 3838.30s]  Is your legs too small?
[3838.30s -> 3847.91s]  Big head.
[3847.91s -> 3849.51s]  All right.
[3849.51s -> 3850.47s]  Color changing a little bit.
[3851.67s -> 3853.67s]  It got a little bit bigger.
[3853.67s -> 3860.01s]  I think it's now we can actually do some breeding here.
[3860.01s -> 3862.07s]  So what do I want to do?
[3862.07s -> 3865.02s]  I definitely want...
[3865.74s -> 3867.42s]  Squary's got some interesting traits.
[3867.42s -> 3867.66s]  All right.
[3867.66s -> 3868.38s]  Let's do...
[3868.38s -> 3869.58s]  You can go to sleep first.
[3869.58s -> 3871.75s]  Squary and mud?
[3871.75s -> 3881.56s]  What do you think?
[3881.56s -> 3882.76s]  Dead body reported.
[3882.76s -> 3884.84s]  This is a foam ham, man.
[3884.84s -> 3890.17s]  Are you injecting cannabis?
[3890.17s -> 3890.81s]  I deleted this.
[3890.81s -> 3891.53s]  Why is it still here?
[3892.09s -> 3895.69s]  Oh, my God.
[3895.69s -> 3896.41s]  There's fucking...
[3896.41s -> 3897.77s]  I just threw them around the room.
[3897.77s -> 3899.24s]  Why is it still here?
[3899.24s -> 3899.64s]  Delete this.
[3900.28s -> 3902.70s]  Oh, wait.
[3902.70s -> 3909.37s]  You okay?
[3909.37s -> 3913.85s]  Speak.
[3913.85s -> 3914.41s]  Very good.
[3914.41s -> 3914.97s]  Very good.
[3914.97s -> 3915.37s]  Very good.
[3915.37s -> 3915.61s]  All right.
[3915.61s -> 3916.33s]  Hang out in the playroom.
[3916.33s -> 3916.97s]  That's fine.
[3916.97s -> 3922.81s]  Where is everybody?
[3922.81s -> 3923.13s]  All right.
[3923.13s -> 3924.33s]  It's time.
[3924.33s -> 3924.97s]  It's time.
[3924.97s -> 3928.57s]  Dude, what do you mean not old enough?
[3928.57s -> 3929.29s]  Not old enough?
[3929.29s -> 3930.01s]  How?
[3930.01s -> 3936.79s]  Are you hungry?
[3936.79s -> 3938.55s]  Just sitting at the food dispenser.
[3941.02s -> 3941.82s]  This is like auto.
[3945.48s -> 3946.12s]  I have a little...
[3947.50s -> 3948.30s]  What's wrong with you?
[3948.86s -> 3954.22s]  I have a little cabinet that I keep dog food and dog treats in.
[3955.78s -> 3956.58s]  And I'll get up.
[3956.58s -> 3957.86s]  They'll be like on the couch or something.
[3957.86s -> 3962.73s]  And I'll just get up and kind of walk through the kitchen area.
[3962.73s -> 3964.73s]  And he's just sitting there.
[3964.73s -> 3966.01s]  He's going like this.
[3967.70s -> 3969.86s]  Sitting and looking at me right in front of the cabinet.
[3971.43s -> 3971.91s]  Just like...
[3973.08s -> 3975.08s]  I don't know how long he's been sitting there.
[3975.08s -> 3980.38s]  But he's just like, I'm here.
[3980.38s -> 3981.42s]  And it's getting old.
[3981.42s -> 3983.02s]  They're not ready to pass on just yet.
[3983.02s -> 3985.58s]  But they don't have much time left.
[3985.58s -> 3988.15s]  What?
[3988.15s -> 3988.63s]  Oh, no.
[3990.74s -> 3991.94s]  Randy's getting older.
[3991.94s -> 3992.98s]  Oh, shit.
[3992.98s -> 3997.67s]  I need to...
[3997.67s -> 3998.31s]  We got to breed, right?
[3998.31s -> 3999.35s]  We got to breed now.
[3999.35s -> 4000.94s]  I got to breed right now.
[4000.94s -> 4005.59s]  We got to breed.
[4005.59s -> 4022.28s]  I have to do it.
[4022.28s -> 4022.84s]  We're going to like...
[4022.84s -> 4024.68s]  Our population is going to decrease.
[4024.68s -> 4027.11s]  I like...
[4027.11s -> 4027.75s]  Okay, I want...
[4028.63s -> 4029.43s]  I like the eyes.
[4029.91s -> 4031.04s]  Who's...
[4036.01s -> 4037.05s]  Very vocal.
[4037.05s -> 4047.27s]  Okay.
[4047.83s -> 4052.87s]  I think this is good.
[4053.43s -> 4054.97s]  Should I keep going?
[4056.70s -> 4057.34s]  It's the giant...
[4057.34s -> 4057.90s]  It's the rat.
[4057.90s -> 4058.62s]  Yeah.
[4058.62s -> 4059.99s]  All right.
[4059.99s -> 4060.87s]  Let's get you in here.
[4064.25s -> 4065.05s]  And let's get...
[4066.97s -> 4067.45s]  You in here.
[4068.09s -> 4068.65s]  You're funny.
[4068.65s -> 4069.61s]  You're doing like a funny thing.
[4077.96s -> 4078.28s]  Again?
[4078.84s -> 4082.17s]  I think that's good.
[4082.17s -> 4084.73s]  I don't think there's enough different genetic mutations here that can happen.
[4088.30s -> 4089.98s]  Generate it 50 times.
[4089.98s -> 4090.22s]  What?
[4090.94s -> 4093.21s]  Is that going to be bad?
[4093.93s -> 4094.81s]  Won't that be bad?
[4099.58s -> 4100.14s]  Keep going.
[4100.86s -> 4105.78s]  Is it a cow?
[4105.78s -> 4106.90s]  What the fuck was that?
[4107.70s -> 4110.23s]  All right.
[4110.23s -> 4111.43s]  Well, we're going to take the cow.
[4112.60s -> 4112.84s]  And...
[4114.76s -> 4115.64s]  Somebody else?
[4115.64s -> 4115.88s]  You?
[4121.98s -> 4122.54s]  All right.
[4122.54s -> 4123.10s]  They're pink.
[4123.98s -> 4124.30s]  Again.
[4124.86s -> 4134.94s]  All right.
[4134.94s -> 4136.06s]  I don't want to do another one.
[4136.06s -> 4142.30s]  All right.
[4142.30s -> 4142.86s]  That's it.
[4142.86s -> 4143.34s]  That's it.
[4143.34s -> 4143.74s]  No more.
[4145.58s -> 4147.91s]  All right.
[4147.91s -> 4149.51s]  We're at 83% stability.
[4149.51s -> 4149.91s]  I don't want...
[4149.91s -> 4150.47s]  That's too much.
[4152.60s -> 4153.64s]  Who just made the weird sound?
[4155.66s -> 4156.22s]  Keep going.
[4158.33s -> 4158.89s]  What?
[4158.89s -> 4161.21s]  What's going to happen?
[4161.21s -> 4162.33s]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[4162.33s -> 4163.69s]  83% stable?
[4168.26s -> 4169.14s]  This one's huge.
[4172.55s -> 4172.87s]  I think...
[4172.87s -> 4173.19s]  All right.
[4173.19s -> 4173.83s]  This one.
[4173.83s -> 4174.15s]  I don't...
[4174.15s -> 4175.59s]  But that one might cause a problem in...
[4176.55s -> 4176.87s]  More?
[4178.54s -> 4178.78s]  No.
[4179.80s -> 4180.04s]  No.
[4180.76s -> 4181.64s]  Is it going to cause a problem?
[4181.64s -> 4182.92s]  He's really kind of rambunctious.
[4183.48s -> 4185.05s]  Let's go.
[4185.05s -> 4195.90s]  All right.
[4195.90s -> 4196.70s]  Now we're going to watch this.
[4197.62s -> 4199.06s]  The dev tweeted at you.
[4199.06s -> 4201.10s]  Really?
[4201.10s -> 4201.58s]  Shut up.
[4201.58s -> 4202.46s]  That didn't happen.
[4202.46s -> 4207.26s]  Shut up.
[4207.26s -> 4208.46s]  Nobody tweeted at me.
[4208.46s -> 4215.26s]  I don't see it.
[4215.26s -> 4222.10s]  It's not...
[4222.10s -> 4226.68s]  I didn't see it.
[4226.68s -> 4226.92s]  All right.
[4226.92s -> 4227.72s]  We know how this works.
[4228.36s -> 4237.51s]  That's cool though.
[4241.00s -> 4242.76s]  The president is on the phone.
[4242.76s -> 4243.56s]  You should pick it up.
[4248.97s -> 4250.55s]  Ah.
[4250.55s -> 4250.95s]  I just...
[4251.59s -> 4252.49s]  I don't know why.
[4253.05s -> 4254.01s]  I just see like...
[4255.11s -> 4256.71s]  Oh, what's going on in the White House today?
[4256.71s -> 4259.11s]  And there's like a picture of like Joe Biden
[4259.11s -> 4261.03s]  sitting in a chair like this.
[4262.23s -> 4264.39s]  With his like sunglasses like down here
[4264.39s -> 4265.91s]  and he's just sleeping.
[4265.91s -> 4268.07s]  And my Wobble Dog stream is like...
[4269.13s -> 4269.69s]  On like the...
[4269.69s -> 4272.09s]  Like a big TV in like the Oval Office.
[4275.42s -> 4277.18s]  Like, oh, your stream is like so boring.
[4282.38s -> 4283.74s]  But why would he be watching?
[4285.90s -> 4286.70s]  Oh, water.
[4294.42s -> 4295.46s]  Why wouldn't he be?
[4295.46s -> 4296.02s]  I don't know.
[4301.80s -> 4302.52s]  Imagine how...
[4303.48s -> 4306.04s]  Imagine any like that big public figure
[4306.04s -> 4306.68s]  just doing the...
[4308.10s -> 4308.58s]  This thing.
[4309.30s -> 4311.51s]  Nobody looks good when they're sleeping
[4311.51s -> 4312.47s]  not in bed, by the way.
[4313.43s -> 4315.03s]  Everybody looks fucking crazy.
[4316.36s -> 4317.00s]  Why is that?
[4318.65s -> 4320.17s]  There has been like pictures I know
[4320.17s -> 4320.81s]  that have been like...
[4321.69s -> 4323.29s]  Everybody has that photo, right?
[4323.29s -> 4324.89s]  Like, oh, mom took it or something.
[4325.45s -> 4327.77s]  Where you're like in like the car
[4327.77s -> 4329.13s]  or you're on the couch or something
[4329.13s -> 4329.53s]  and you're like...
[4330.09s -> 4334.47s]  Like, what the...
[4334.47s -> 4335.03s]  Why do we do...
[4335.03s -> 4336.23s]  What's going on here?
[4336.23s -> 4337.11s]  Why do we go like...
[4340.34s -> 4341.46s]  Like, it hurts to do that.
[4341.46s -> 4342.58s]  It's actually hard to do that.
[4343.14s -> 4346.38s]  How come we don't go like...
[4347.77s -> 4348.57s]  It's always like...
[4349.13s -> 4354.65s]  All right, incubate that egg.
[4354.65s -> 4358.15s]  I can't wait to see what happens here.
[4358.15s -> 4362.12s]  We're unknowingly supporting our heads.
[4362.12s -> 4363.26s]  That's weird.
[4363.26s -> 4368.41s]  The body was never meant to fall asleep
[4368.41s -> 4369.29s]  sitting upright.
[4380.39s -> 4382.07s]  You literally showed a picture of you
[4382.07s -> 4382.95s]  once when he's sleeping
[4382.95s -> 4383.91s]  and he looked like beef?
[4384.63s -> 4385.83s]  Beef and cheese?
[4385.83s -> 4387.35s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[4388.84s -> 4389.72s]  Oh!
[4389.72s -> 4390.60s]  All right, we need a name.
[4397.94s -> 4400.60s]  Spam.
[4400.68s -> 4401.18s]  Ew.
[4403.46s -> 4405.06s]  All right, welcome to the world, Spam.
[4405.62s -> 4409.54s]  How are you?
[4409.54s -> 4410.50s]  You're going to get a steady diet
[4410.50s -> 4417.06s]  of coconuts and bananas.
[4417.06s -> 4418.42s]  You must be very hungry.
[4418.42s -> 4419.56s]  Go relax.
[4419.56s -> 4425.50s]  How's everybody doing?
[4425.50s -> 4426.70s]  All right, Mud, you need to...
[4426.70s -> 4427.10s]  Is this...
[4427.10s -> 4429.38s]  Aren't they close to...
[4429.38s -> 4430.58s]  I need to breed again,
[4430.58s -> 4431.62s]  but I don't need to.
[4431.62s -> 4432.12s]  Not yet.
[4433.10s -> 4433.66s]  Well, that...
[4433.66s -> 4435.02s]  You're going to die much faster
[4435.02s -> 4441.30s]  if you keep doing that.
[4441.30s -> 4441.86s]  All right, Mud.
[4444.70s -> 4450.58s]  Should I breed again?
[4450.58s -> 4454.98s]  I don't think I want to.
[4454.98s -> 4456.42s]  You can recycle plastic bottles
[4456.42s -> 4457.54s]  by giving them to a dog?
[4459.27s -> 4460.39s]  What if you eat this...
[4460.39s -> 4461.19s]  Well, I don't...
[4461.27s -> 4461.99s]  I don't know, but you should probably
[4461.99s -> 4463.27s]  shouldn't eat plastic.
[4463.27s -> 4465.69s]  What happens if I eat...
[4465.69s -> 4466.73s]  Grab it.
[4466.73s -> 4468.86s]  Throw it.
[4468.86s -> 4469.98s]  That was a good try.
[4469.98s -> 4471.02s]  That was a good try.
[4471.02s -> 4471.50s]  Try it again.
[4472.65s -> 4473.15s]  Throw it.
[4473.61s -> 4477.13s]  Come on, you can do it.
[4477.13s -> 4477.85s]  Come on.
[4477.85s -> 4480.30s]  Get over there and do it.
[4480.30s -> 4481.02s]  Throw it.
[4481.02s -> 4486.97s]  Come on.
[4486.97s -> 4491.32s]  You can do it.
[4491.32s -> 4491.82s]  Oh!
[4492.36s -> 4495.94s]  That was so good.
[4495.94s -> 4496.90s]  You threw that.
[4496.90s -> 4500.15s]  That was so good.
[4500.15s -> 4502.07s]  Okay, now destroy that.
[4502.07s -> 4506.86s]  Oh.
[4506.86s -> 4508.46s]  Your dogs can't walk.
[4508.46s -> 4509.58s]  There's a baby.
[4509.58s -> 4511.67s]  It just came out.
[4513.19s -> 4516.47s]  What do you mean?
[4516.47s -> 4517.99s]  This is the weirdest one.
[4517.99s -> 4519.67s]  I can't wait to breed this one.
[4519.67s -> 4524.25s]  He's a baby.
[4524.25s -> 4524.89s]  Yeah, the baby...
[4527.74s -> 4528.14s]  Oh, sorry.
[4528.14s -> 4529.10s]  The baby doesn't know how to walk.
[4529.66s -> 4534.20s]  What are you doing?
[4536.60s -> 4539.72s]  I want to feed a very good diet of bananas
[4541.16s -> 4542.68s]  and coconuts.
[4542.68s -> 4547.05s]  I don't want you eating chicken nuggets
[4547.05s -> 4547.37s]  or anything.
[4547.37s -> 4549.53s]  I want you eating good, nutritious fruits.
[4550.09s -> 4553.64s]  And it has lived a long, full life
[4553.64s -> 4562.49s]  and it's now time for them to pass on.
[4562.49s -> 4563.69s]  Oh no, Randy.
[4564.25s -> 4570.88s]  Oh!
[4572.73s -> 4573.69s]  Oh my God.
[4573.69s -> 4574.19s]  What?
[4578.17s -> 4579.61s]  No, don't eat him.
[4579.61s -> 4581.61s]  He's going to go eat his body.
[4581.69s -> 4583.29s]  No, he's the weird one.
[4583.29s -> 4584.17s]  He's the weird one.
[4584.89s -> 4586.41s]  Don't...
[4586.41s -> 4587.53s]  You're not going to eat that, right?
[4587.53s -> 4587.93s]  How do I...
[4587.93s -> 4588.25s]  What do I...
[4588.25s -> 4588.89s]  Dog head?
[4589.94s -> 4590.44s]  Oh!
[4590.98s -> 4594.07s]  Should I...
[4594.07s -> 4594.87s]  I don't know what I should do.
[4594.87s -> 4595.27s]  Should I...
[4595.27s -> 4596.47s]  Is this extra DNA points?
[4599.99s -> 4601.59s]  Oh my God.
[4601.59s -> 4603.19s]  Do I get DNA or something?
[4603.19s -> 4603.75s]  Is this worth...
[4603.75s -> 4604.15s]  I don't know.
[4604.15s -> 4604.95s]  Is it worth doing this?
[4609.35s -> 4611.11s]  I might get like DNA points.
[4611.11s -> 4611.67s]  I don't know.
[4612.65s -> 4613.53s]  All right.
[4613.53s -> 4614.49s]  I'm just testing this.
[4614.49s -> 4615.05s]  I don't like this
[4615.05s -> 4617.21s]  but this might actually unlock something.
[4617.21s -> 4630.49s]  It does.
[4637.67s -> 4639.03s]  Okay, don't eat every...
[4639.03s -> 4640.31s]  Okay, this is fucked up.
[4642.74s -> 4644.58s]  High quality dog core?
[4645.22s -> 4646.17s]  What is that?
[4646.89s -> 4648.33s]  High quality dog core.
[4648.89s -> 4650.52s]  Mysterious orb.
[4651.08s -> 4653.85s]  Should I open it?
[4653.85s -> 4659.72s]  Cracked open.
[4660.28s -> 4662.50s]  What is that?
[4664.50s -> 4665.46s]  Somebody should eat this?
[4675.06s -> 4675.38s]  All right.
[4675.38s -> 4676.26s]  You don't look at this.
[4676.26s -> 4677.54s]  I don't want you to see this.
[4677.54s -> 4683.16s]  You just stay over here and eat the coconuts.
[4683.16s -> 4685.85s]  Lifespan extended.
[4685.85s -> 4686.97s]  Oh, look at that.
[4686.97s -> 4687.47s]  Okay.
[4687.77s -> 4689.48s]  All right.
[4689.48s -> 4690.12s]  You need to go to bed.
[4690.68s -> 4695.06s]  All right.
[4695.06s -> 4695.78s]  You guys go to sleep.
[4696.50s -> 4699.45s]  Eat this coconut.
[4700.01s -> 4700.81s]  It's nutritious.
[4700.81s -> 4702.81s]  Don't eat other dogs, please.
[4705.78s -> 4706.42s]  Are you ready?
[4706.42s -> 4706.98s]  Okay.
[4706.98s -> 4707.94s]  Pupate.
[4707.94s -> 4710.66s]  You're both ready to pupate.
[4710.66s -> 4718.52s]  You want to eat that first?
[4722.01s -> 4730.54s]  Eat that first because I want you to get more mutations.
[4730.54s -> 4731.26s]  I mean, one of you did.
[4731.26s -> 4732.06s]  That was fucking cool.
[4736.73s -> 4736.97s]  All right.
[4736.97s -> 4737.77s]  You know, go for it.
[4737.77s -> 4738.27s]  Pupate.
[4740.58s -> 4741.08s]  Where's...
[4742.26s -> 4753.32s]  We'll figure that out later.
[4753.32s -> 4762.76s]  All right.
[4762.76s -> 4763.64s]  What do we got?
[4763.64s -> 4765.14s]  You just ate something weird.
[4765.14s -> 4765.94s]  Now you're...
[4765.94s -> 4768.74s]  Okay.
[4768.74s -> 4774.34s]  Adult, back legs, front legs.
[4774.90s -> 4777.53s]  He's pretty big now.
[4777.53s -> 4778.89s]  Front, bottom, leg length.
[4781.22s -> 4783.46s]  I feel like the proportions are kind of wrong.
[4783.46s -> 4793.67s]  Interesting.
[4793.67s -> 4794.79s]  What happened to you?
[4794.79s -> 4796.01s]  Nothing really.
[4799.11s -> 4799.59s]  Okay.
[4799.59s -> 4800.95s]  You got a little wider.
[4800.95s -> 4805.42s]  Okay.
[4805.42s -> 4806.22s]  Very interesting.
[4806.22s -> 4807.02s]  Very interesting.
[4807.02s -> 4811.67s]  You can't walk now?
[4811.67s -> 4812.63s]  Yeah, you'll be fine.
[4812.63s -> 4817.21s]  It's fine.
[4822.04s -> 4822.76s]  There we go.
[4822.76s -> 4823.32s]  Oh, God.
[4823.32s -> 4824.20s]  You actually can't walk.
[4827.75s -> 4828.87s]  You need to go to bed.
[4828.87s -> 4837.37s]  Okay.
[4837.37s -> 4838.01s]  You're fine.
[4838.01s -> 4841.40s]  You can walk.
[4841.40s -> 4844.79s]  They do need to go to sleep, though.
[4844.79s -> 4844.87s]  All right.
[4844.87s -> 4845.67s]  Let's clean up a little bit.
[4845.67s -> 4847.03s]  This is kind of a mess.
[4847.03s -> 4856.10s]  A mess.
[4856.10s -> 4862.42s]  Okay.
[4862.42s -> 4863.62s]  I got a lot of things to unlock.
[4863.62s -> 4865.74s]  Clean up 10 poops.
[4865.74s -> 4866.78s]  A ham slider.
[4866.78s -> 4868.30s]  Cool.
[4868.30s -> 4869.93s]  Witness of death.
[4869.93s -> 4872.76s]  Dog Vision Jr.
[4872.76s -> 4873.96s]  Open up a dog core.
[4874.44s -> 4875.56s]  Rock Speaker.
[4875.56s -> 4877.96s]  Play for an hour.
[4877.96s -> 4880.74s]  Space Lab Food.
[4880.74s -> 4881.70s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[4881.70s -> 4882.02s]  All right.
[4882.02s -> 4882.26s]  All right.
[4882.26s -> 4882.58s]  We got to...
[4883.30s -> 4884.02s]  Let's do this right.
[4888.36s -> 4888.76s]  What do you think?
[4888.76s -> 4889.32s]  Up top?
[4889.32s -> 4895.80s]  And then connect this.
[4895.80s -> 4896.52s]  Oh, shit.
[4896.52s -> 4897.16s]  I can't do that.
[4903.62s -> 4904.50s]  This is where they're going to...
[4904.50s -> 4905.94s]  The feeding will be here.
[4905.94s -> 4908.17s]  I don't think they can connect like that.
[4908.17s -> 4908.97s]  Oh, they can?
[4908.97s -> 4914.89s]  Can I do that?
[4914.89s -> 4915.77s]  Starting room?
[4915.77s -> 4916.49s]  Oh, starting wall.
[4916.49s -> 4917.05s]  Okay.
[4917.05s -> 4929.94s]  Starting room.
[4929.94s -> 4930.74s]  How do I move?
[4930.74s -> 4939.77s]  There we go.
[4939.77s -> 4940.33s]  What the...
[4940.33s -> 4942.89s]  Okay.
[4942.89s -> 4944.81s]  That works, right?
[4944.81s -> 4951.74s]  How do they get up there?
[4951.74s -> 4953.58s]  Can they get up there?
[4953.58s -> 4958.09s]  I'm not sure they can go that way.
[4958.09s -> 4972.04s]  Oh, there we go.
[4972.04s -> 4972.36s]  All right.
[4972.36s -> 4973.48s]  Now, how do I...
[4973.48s -> 4974.76s]  This is fucked up.
[4974.76s -> 4976.28s]  How do I remove this one?
[4976.28s -> 4979.58s]  Oh, God.
[4979.58s -> 4981.42s]  I'm just starting to look at McDonald's play place.
[4984.20s -> 4986.54s]  Okay.
[4986.54s -> 4986.94s]  There we go.
[4986.94s -> 4990.46s]  So, this is going to be the feeding room.
[4990.46s -> 4996.92s]  What should I do?
[4996.92s -> 4997.24s]  Food.
[4997.24s -> 4998.92s]  Let's do like a food room.
[4998.92s -> 5000.28s]  Actually, this kind of reminds me like Chuck E Cheese.
[5000.28s -> 5000.92s]  Let's do that.
[5000.92s -> 5002.92s]  To check the Twitter.
[5002.92s -> 5003.16s]  All right.
[5003.16s -> 5003.64s]  I'm checking Twitter.
[5003.64s -> 5003.80s]  Hold on.
[5003.80s -> 5004.44s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[5004.44s -> 5007.58s]  What am I looking for?
[5013.22s -> 5016.50s]  Okay.
[5016.50s -> 5023.72s]  We need a nap.
[5023.72s -> 5025.32s]  Please sing your fans a lullaby.
[5025.32s -> 5031.03s]  They won't stop asking me about it.
[5031.03s -> 5032.39s]  Please breed your dogs.
[5035.19s -> 5036.39s]  Aren't I doing that?
[5036.39s -> 5037.93s]  I'm breeding.
[5037.93s -> 5040.58s]  Or please breed your dogs.
[5041.14s -> 5041.94s]  Didn't I do that?
[5041.94s -> 5046.01s]  Yeah, this actually is the dev, isn't it?
[5046.01s -> 5046.41s]  Okay.
[5046.41s -> 5047.75s]  Well, that's cool.
[5047.75s -> 5048.23s]  I didn't...
[5048.23s -> 5049.27s]  I did it, didn't I?
[5049.27s -> 5052.60s]  Sing, chat, a lullaby.
[5067.02s -> 5068.62s]  When you get old enough, over 21.
[5068.62s -> 5076.95s]  You woke up the baby.
[5076.95s -> 5078.62s]  All right.
[5078.62s -> 5079.42s]  Food.
[5079.42s -> 5083.06s]  That was Trump.
[5083.06s -> 5089.88s]  That was Trump.
[5089.88s -> 5095.18s]  All right.
[5095.18s -> 5102.33s]  This is the food room.
[5102.33s -> 5105.77s]  All dogs will come up here to the cafeteria station.
[5105.77s -> 5110.55s]  This is where they will be enjoying their meals.
[5110.55s -> 5114.34s]  This is going to be huge.
[5114.34s -> 5120.97s]  This is an ugly room.
[5120.97s -> 5121.45s]  All right.
[5121.45s -> 5121.69s]  Food.
[5121.69s -> 5126.58s]  There should be something to eat on.
[5126.58s -> 5127.14s]  Oh, no.
[5127.14s -> 5128.34s]  I actually don't think so.
[5129.38s -> 5129.70s]  Okay.
[5129.70s -> 5130.74s]  So now let's go play.
[5131.93s -> 5136.70s]  We got alien fruit.
[5136.70s -> 5137.74s]  Dehydrated treats.
[5142.23s -> 5143.19s]  Moon cheese.
[5143.19s -> 5144.90s]  Sure.
[5144.90s -> 5145.38s]  Onion.
[5145.38s -> 5148.68s]  Oh, okay.
[5148.68s -> 5150.20s]  If they're hungry, they come up here.
[5150.20s -> 5151.08s]  They just got a lot of food.
[5151.08s -> 5152.28s]  They can just eat on the ground.
[5152.28s -> 5154.10s]  It's going to mutate the fuck out of them, though.
[5154.10s -> 5154.90s]  But who cares?
[5154.90s -> 5159.22s]  Whoever's hungry.
[5159.22s -> 5162.26s]  Okay.
[5162.26s -> 5164.10s]  I need to hatch you now.
[5164.10s -> 5171.10s]  Let's go.
[5171.10s -> 5173.50s]  Very cool.
[5173.50s -> 5175.42s]  Front leg stance width.
[5175.42s -> 5177.16s]  Body girth.
[5177.16s -> 5177.72s]  All right.
[5177.72s -> 5179.40s]  We need to get...
[5179.40s -> 5180.60s]  I got to get that egg in here.
[5180.60s -> 5182.62s]  Okay.
[5182.62s -> 5183.50s]  We got to do another one.
[5183.50s -> 5183.82s]  Yeah.
[5183.82s -> 5184.14s]  Let's go.
[5184.14s -> 5187.93s]  Hurry up.
[5187.93s -> 5191.10s]  Mud and, uh, squary.
[5191.10s -> 5192.55s]  Let's go.
[5192.55s -> 5199.74s]  What do I do?
[5199.74s -> 5202.50s]  What happened to the fourth one?
[5202.50s -> 5204.10s]  Oh, it's dead in the other room.
[5204.10s -> 5205.37s]  Definitely this one.
[5205.37s -> 5205.45s]  All right.
[5205.45s -> 5207.13s]  We got a raid from G4.
[5207.13s -> 5208.17s]  G4 TV.
[5208.17s -> 5210.01s]  You guys just fucking dump raids on me.
[5210.01s -> 5210.49s]  Thanks, guys.
[5211.13s -> 5213.06s]  I hope you're having a good stream.
[5213.70s -> 5216.49s]  This is like the...
[5216.49s -> 5218.25s]  This is the fourth time the G4 has been here.
[5218.81s -> 5220.55s]  What's up, G4?
[5222.02s -> 5222.58s]  I appreciate it.
[5222.58s -> 5223.06s]  Thanks a lot.
[5225.10s -> 5225.58s]  All right.
[5225.58s -> 5227.42s]  I'll take this one to zero.
[5227.42s -> 5234.31s]  Let's do two, like, kind of little ones.
[5234.31s -> 5238.97s]  G4 would like an encore.
[5239.53s -> 5240.33s]  All right.
[5240.33s -> 5241.53s]  This one's kind of weird.
[5241.53s -> 5242.81s]  How long should I do this for, though?
[5248.47s -> 5249.35s]  These two.
[5249.35s -> 5251.35s]  They're really, like, thin, skinny ones.
[5251.35s -> 5253.26s]  Do it until zero?
[5253.82s -> 5256.62s]  This one's really, like, glossy.
[5256.62s -> 5256.86s]  Yeah.
[5256.86s -> 5259.11s]  That one.
[5259.11s -> 5261.19s]  These two, like, pieces of fucking ham.
[5264.81s -> 5265.13s]  Whoa.
[5267.77s -> 5268.01s]  All right.
[5268.01s -> 5268.41s]  We got...
[5270.58s -> 5271.14s]  Interesting.
[5274.98s -> 5275.22s]  Again.
[5275.86s -> 5282.76s]  Again.
[5283.70s -> 5285.62s]  This really long one.
[5285.62s -> 5289.53s]  What happened?
[5289.53s -> 5289.93s]  Oh!
[5290.57s -> 5291.53s]  This one's...
[5291.53s -> 5291.77s]  Okay.
[5291.77s -> 5291.93s]  No.
[5291.93s -> 5292.33s]  We're good.
[5295.58s -> 5296.46s]  I don't know which one...
[5297.10s -> 5297.74s]  Should I take one?
[5298.30s -> 5301.74s]  I think I want to take this one.
[5304.63s -> 5305.11s]  One more?
[5307.10s -> 5307.82s]  Take the long one?
[5308.46s -> 5311.96s]  All right.
[5311.96s -> 5312.52s]  One more time.
[5313.08s -> 5318.68s]  Okay.
[5318.68s -> 5319.08s]  This one.
[5319.08s -> 5319.64s]  Look at this one.
[5321.58s -> 5322.38s]  That's so weird.
[5322.38s -> 5322.62s]  All right.
[5322.62s -> 5323.74s]  How about one more?
[5323.74s -> 5324.14s]  One more.
[5324.78s -> 5339.88s]  They're becoming, like, slices of bacon.
[5339.88s -> 5341.48s]  These two.
[5341.48s -> 5342.28s]  Like, yes.
[5346.30s -> 5346.80s]  Uh...
[5347.82s -> 5348.54s]  It looks...
[5348.54s -> 5355.06s]  Do it...
[5355.06s -> 5355.62s]  Keep going?
[5358.97s -> 5359.37s]  No, no.
[5359.37s -> 5359.61s]  All right.
[5359.61s -> 5362.17s]  The stability is going lower here.
[5362.17s -> 5363.53s]  I think it's going to be this one.
[5365.05s -> 5366.17s]  They have six legs?
[5367.96s -> 5368.84s]  What the fuck?
[5370.65s -> 5371.15s]  Oh!
[5372.60s -> 5373.10s]  Oh!
[5373.64s -> 5387.64s]  All right.
[5387.64s -> 5396.31s]  Do not be disturbed by progress.
[5406.79s -> 5409.13s]  Okay, Frankenstein.
[5409.13s -> 5413.83s]  I mean, the Dr. Frankenstein, not the monster.
[5413.83s -> 5415.99s]  Frankenstein's monster is the name of that character.
[5415.99s -> 5416.79s]  Stupid.
[5416.79s -> 5426.09s]  All right.
[5426.09s -> 5426.73s]  We know how this works.
[5426.73s -> 5428.74s]  Let's do it.
[5428.74s -> 5430.02s]  I'm very excited.
[5430.02s -> 5433.54s]  Book report Andy.
[5434.74s -> 5438.18s]  How many animals do we have left?
[5438.18s -> 5438.90s]  Okay.
[5438.90s -> 5441.05s]  Let's get that incubated.
[5441.05s -> 5443.53s]  Who's hungry?
[5444.60s -> 5445.32s]  All right, spam.
[5446.65s -> 5449.77s]  Head up to the designated food room and I want you to eat an onion ring.
[5449.77s -> 5451.74s]  Are you hungry too?
[5451.74s -> 5452.30s]  No, you're okay.
[5452.94s -> 5455.26s]  Oh, Squary's...
[5455.26s -> 5455.82s]  Squary's been...
[5455.82s -> 5457.26s]  Okay, Squary's eating two people now.
[5457.26s -> 5457.58s]  All right.
[5457.58s -> 5458.54s]  E-eat this.
[5459.10s -> 5462.79s]  We need Squary to live a long time.
[5463.35s -> 5465.94s]  Take another egg, please.
[5466.50s -> 5471.35s]  Squary, then go upstairs after this.
[5471.35s -> 5473.10s]  Oh boy, Squary.
[5473.10s -> 5474.07s]  What are you doing?
[5474.07s -> 5474.47s]  You all right?
[5479.86s -> 5480.42s]  Eat that core.
[5480.98s -> 5488.47s]  Go up there.
[5488.47s -> 5490.44s]  What are you doing?
[5490.44s -> 5492.44s]  Oh, you're just having so much trouble.
[5492.44s -> 5493.72s]  What's wrong with this one?
[5493.72s -> 5497.03s]  This one can't really walk.
[5497.59s -> 5502.39s]  This one takes a very long time to get anywhere.
[5502.39s -> 5503.03s]  This is sad.
[5504.46s -> 5505.10s]  I'll bring it down.
[5505.10s -> 5505.58s]  I'll bring it down.
[5505.58s -> 5506.06s]  I'll bring it down.
[5506.62s -> 5512.79s]  Can I bring it down?
[5512.79s -> 5520.15s]  All right, eat that onion ring.
[5520.15s -> 5523.21s]  Eat it.
[5523.21s -> 5530.17s]  You don't like it?
[5532.02s -> 5532.82s]  You look like you like it.
[5532.82s -> 5533.46s]  You don't like it?
[5536.81s -> 5537.45s]  Okay.
[5537.45s -> 5539.77s]  I don't...
[5539.77s -> 5542.09s]  Oh, he puked.
[5542.09s -> 5542.89s]  Why did he puke?
[5544.33s -> 5544.89s]  Okay, wait.
[5544.89s -> 5545.13s]  Why?
[5545.13s -> 5545.85s]  Why did you puke?
[5546.41s -> 5547.13s]  Are you all right?
[5547.69s -> 5548.41s]  Oh, shit.
[5550.41s -> 5550.73s]  No, no.
[5550.73s -> 5551.45s]  Don't eat the puke.
[5552.89s -> 5555.14s]  Oh, what's wrong with it?
[5555.14s -> 5555.94s]  You don't like onion ring.
[5555.94s -> 5557.14s]  Don't eat teeth and puke.
[5559.18s -> 5559.74s]  I don't know.
[5559.74s -> 5560.62s]  Didn't like the onion ring.
[5564.25s -> 5564.89s]  Oh, okay.
[5564.89s -> 5565.45s]  Are you all right?
[5568.25s -> 5569.21s]  Here, have a coconut.
[5569.21s -> 5570.01s]  That's like nutritious.
[5573.80s -> 5575.06s]  Sweating.
[5575.06s -> 5575.54s]  What's wrong?
[5576.57s -> 5580.81s]  Lazy doesn't care for food and rude.
[5581.37s -> 5583.62s]  How are you going to stay alive?
[5583.62s -> 5584.74s]  You don't like food?
[5584.74s -> 5584.98s]  What?
[5586.81s -> 5587.13s]  Uh-oh.
[5587.77s -> 5589.90s]  Eat the coconut?
[5591.48s -> 5594.52s]  Lazy, rude, and doesn't eat food.
[5594.52s -> 5599.43s]  Okay.
[5603.75s -> 5608.71s]  How about just raw?
[5608.71s -> 5612.46s]  Here we go.
[5612.46s -> 5618.44s]  I got to put some of this food down here.
[5618.44s -> 5619.08s]  Is it like rotten?
[5619.08s -> 5619.72s]  Is that the problem?
[5620.28s -> 5625.77s]  How do I lift stuff up?
[5625.77s -> 5629.48s]  Is there a way I can lift this up vertically?
[5629.48s -> 5630.60s]  I know there's a way.
[5630.60s -> 5631.48s]  There it is.
[5631.48s -> 5636.41s]  Everyone start eating food, please.
[5638.84s -> 5639.56s]  Alien fruit.
[5639.56s -> 5640.20s]  Somebody eat it.
[5643.78s -> 5644.34s]  Moon cheese.
[5644.34s -> 5645.22s]  Somebody eat it.
[5645.22s -> 5654.23s]  Okay, there we go.
[5654.23s -> 5655.27s]  You eat the alien fruit.
[5655.27s -> 5656.79s]  I feel like that should be what you should be doing.
[5660.14s -> 5660.94s]  Raw.
[5660.94s -> 5662.63s]  Just hungry.
[5663.19s -> 5664.55s]  What just happened?
[5664.55s -> 5665.67s]  What's going on?
[5666.31s -> 5667.03s]  What's wrong with everybody?
[5667.67s -> 5670.57s]  Why are you all wet?
[5671.37s -> 5672.87s]  Eat that like cheese.
[5677.37s -> 5678.09s]  The stock.
[5680.12s -> 5682.84s]  Okay, has Squary been asleep for like a week?
[5698.98s -> 5699.62s]  Oh my god.
[5699.62s -> 5700.50s]  This is so sad.
[5701.22s -> 5701.86s]  I don't think this is...
[5701.86s -> 5702.74s]  I don't think...
[5702.74s -> 5703.78s]  I don't think rock and walk.
[5705.32s -> 5705.56s]  Here.
[5708.26s -> 5708.74s]  Eat that.
[5709.30s -> 5712.98s]  You like it?
[5714.23s -> 5714.47s]  Okay.
[5718.23s -> 5719.27s]  Half eaten food.
[5721.78s -> 5722.66s]  Oh, you're ready to mutate.
[5722.66s -> 5722.98s]  Let's go.
[5723.62s -> 5728.52s]  Why are they all wet?
[5729.40s -> 5733.61s]  I don't understand.
[5733.61s -> 5735.34s]  Why are they wet?
[5736.06s -> 5737.22s]  They're all wet.
[5738.10s -> 5744.89s]  There's no AC.
[5745.61s -> 5746.73s]  He doesn't like it.
[5746.73s -> 5747.85s]  He threw up.
[5747.85s -> 5748.41s]  What?
[5748.41s -> 5754.09s]  Who's even alive?
[5754.65s -> 5756.09s]  Oh, okay, you're fine.
[5757.29s -> 5758.25s]  Let me get you a...
[5758.25s -> 5759.29s]  All right, hold on.
[5759.29s -> 5761.61s]  Hatcho mutated a dog with more than four legs.
[5761.61s -> 5762.17s]  Honeycomb.
[5763.61s -> 5768.65s]  Hopefully you mutated into something.
[5770.62s -> 5771.18s]  Oh, you got...
[5771.18s -> 5771.74s]  It's huge.
[5772.62s -> 5773.02s]  Huge.
[5774.89s -> 5775.77s]  And what else?
[5778.73s -> 5779.45s]  34%.
[5783.48s -> 5785.16s]  Doesn't care for food.
[5785.16s -> 5787.00s]  Lazy and is rude.
[5787.64s -> 5790.94s]  Can this dog even fit in the house?
[5790.94s -> 5799.96s]  All right, yeah.
[5799.96s -> 5801.24s]  Go get some sleep.
[5801.24s -> 5808.30s]  Okay, who else?
[5808.30s -> 5809.77s]  You guys are doing fine over here.
[5810.41s -> 5813.08s]  All right.
[5813.48s -> 5814.92s]  Should I do more breeding?
[5814.92s -> 5819.42s]  I'm gonna have to breed these two again.
[5823.50s -> 5826.46s]  And this time we're going to take them to zero.
[5828.20s -> 5828.76s]  Oh, okay.
[5829.40s -> 5831.80s]  They sound like snakes.
[5832.44s -> 5841.91s]  How about...
[5842.55s -> 5844.89s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[5844.89s -> 5848.89s]  You should import somebody else's dog.
[5848.89s -> 5850.09s]  Well, hold on now.
[5850.09s -> 5850.81s]  Not quite.
[5858.26s -> 5858.74s]  Salmon.
[5863.27s -> 5865.27s]  Okay, what does the stability actually mean?
[5866.74s -> 5867.54s]  Can somebody help me out with that?
[5867.54s -> 5868.74s]  What does that realistically mean?
[5876.94s -> 5879.26s]  Less stability equals more mutations.
[5879.26s -> 5880.38s]  Oh, okay.
[5880.38s -> 5887.22s]  That's how crazy it is.
[5888.25s -> 5889.13s]  Oh, we got an orange.
[5890.90s -> 5891.46s]  Orange dog.
[5892.18s -> 5902.57s]  All right, we're gonna get an orange.
[5903.29s -> 5903.77s]  It's huge.
[5910.41s -> 5911.29s]  All right, we're getting weird.
[5913.72s -> 5914.04s]  Again?
[5920.25s -> 5921.82s]  What happened?
[5921.82s -> 5931.70s]  We lost some along the way here.
[5931.70s -> 5932.82s]  All right, they're not that...
[5932.82s -> 5934.10s]  They don't look that bad.
[5934.10s -> 5939.37s]  They look actually pretty healthy.
[5940.01s -> 5947.24s]  They still look actually perfectly fine.
[5947.88s -> 5958.44s]  How about these two?
[5958.44s -> 5961.08s]  34% stability, but they look all right.
[5961.96s -> 5964.36s]  All right, maybe one more.
[5964.92s -> 5975.00s]  All right, look at this one.
[5975.00s -> 5977.16s]  Orange and green and looks very strong.
[5977.96s -> 5982.20s]  Keep doing it.
[5982.20s -> 5983.16s]  Go to zero.
[5993.14s -> 5993.46s]  Again?
[6001.99s -> 6016.26s]  All right, this is where it's zero.
[6016.26s -> 6016.90s]  We're good.
[6016.90s -> 6025.24s]  Oh, yeah.
[6025.24s -> 6031.90s]  I got an achievement for that.
[6033.08s -> 6041.90s]  You got the perfect dog.
[6041.90s -> 6047.58s]  I think I'm getting some cool stuff here.
[6047.58s -> 6053.13s]  Okay, get a litter in the...
[6053.13s -> 6055.29s]  Get a tiny litter in the breeding simulation.
[6055.29s -> 6056.01s]  Okay, an egg.
[6057.08s -> 6058.04s]  And then what do I get for this?
[6058.92s -> 6060.12s]  Simulated floor.
[6062.78s -> 6063.42s]  Cool.
[6063.42s -> 6065.02s]  All right, let's get that egg in there.
[6067.45s -> 6073.93s]  All right, spam is...
[6074.89s -> 6076.17s]  I don't think I want to breed spam.
[6076.73s -> 6079.06s]  I think we just let spam die.
[6080.02s -> 6082.79s]  Because, you know what I mean?
[6082.79s -> 6084.94s]  It's not looking great.
[6094.71s -> 6095.11s]  Sad.
[6095.67s -> 6097.34s]  What the fuck?
[6097.34s -> 6098.62s]  Oh, this is the playroom, right?
[6098.62s -> 6103.16s]  You're going to have fun in the playroom?
[6103.16s -> 6104.44s]  Yeah, go play with this.
[6104.44s -> 6105.72s]  Go bite that.
[6105.72s -> 6112.09s]  Here we go.
[6112.09s -> 6113.72s]  All right, how about...
[6119.22s -> 6120.18s]  Creamsicle.
[6120.18s -> 6135.62s]  Butter?
[6135.62s -> 6136.12s]  No.
[6137.22s -> 6138.71s]  Carrot.
[6138.71s -> 6139.43s]  No.
[6139.43s -> 6141.59s]  Cheese, brick.
[6141.59s -> 6145.29s]  Butterscotch.
[6145.29s -> 6155.08s]  Sherbert.
[6155.08s -> 6158.90s]  All right, Sherbert.
[6158.90s -> 6160.58s]  I want to feed you really weird shit,
[6160.58s -> 6161.30s]  so I want you to come...
[6161.70s -> 6162.82s]  Are you able to walk?
[6162.82s -> 6167.37s]  How are you doing?
[6167.37s -> 6169.05s]  Some dogs eat to live.
[6169.05s -> 6170.78s]  This one lives to eat.
[6170.78s -> 6172.22s]  Not very interested in other dogs.
[6173.85s -> 6174.57s]  And lazy.
[6176.41s -> 6177.77s]  Why are they all so lazy?
[6177.77s -> 6179.29s]  Look, they can't even do anything.
[6179.29s -> 6180.09s]  It takes them so long.
[6182.25s -> 6183.53s]  All right, what do I want to feed you?
[6185.06s -> 6185.70s]  Something.
[6185.70s -> 6187.67s]  Oh, mud.
[6187.67s -> 6188.47s]  How are you doing?
[6188.47s -> 6189.78s]  You want some food, mud?
[6191.46s -> 6192.50s]  How about a ham slider?
[6192.50s -> 6193.22s]  Let's try that one.
[6193.94s -> 6194.79s]  Good to go.
[6197.85s -> 6198.25s]  Try this.
[6198.81s -> 6204.66s]  You like ham?
[6204.66s -> 6205.43s]  You do?
[6205.43s -> 6206.31s]  All right, good.
[6206.31s -> 6212.14s]  All right, I want something weird here.
[6214.02s -> 6214.66s]  Alien fruit.
[6217.42s -> 6221.29s]  I'm going to feed that to the guy we just came up with.
[6223.83s -> 6232.38s]  Get in there.
[6235.45s -> 6238.86s]  Where's the fruit?
[6238.86s -> 6241.64s]  What happened?
[6241.64s -> 6251.66s]  Climb.
[6251.66s -> 6254.82s]  This takes a while here.
[6254.82s -> 6255.46s]  Come on.
[6255.46s -> 6259.43s]  All right, where did the fruit go?
[6261.70s -> 6263.06s]  Where did that alien fruit...
[6263.06s -> 6264.10s]  I don't understand.
[6264.10s -> 6265.99s]  It's just gone.
[6265.99s -> 6266.87s]  It just doesn't exist.
[6266.87s -> 6273.85s]  All right, give that a try.
[6273.85s -> 6278.94s]  What did you get?
[6278.94s -> 6280.82s]  Coconuts?
[6280.82s -> 6285.32s]  Oh, Spam actually likes coconuts.
[6285.32s -> 6286.20s]  That's insane.
[6286.20s -> 6288.50s]  Spam hates food.
[6288.50s -> 6290.84s]  Okay, Spam likes coconuts.
[6290.84s -> 6293.78s]  That's very important to remember.
[6293.78s -> 6302.38s]  I don't have any den upgrades.
[6302.38s -> 6305.75s]  Okay, eat this like tooth, too.
[6305.75s -> 6313.34s]  All right, raw.
[6313.34s -> 6314.06s]  What do we get?
[6319.50s -> 6325.05s]  All right, got a little more green.
[6325.05s -> 6325.85s]  Legs got bigger.
[6325.85s -> 6326.49s]  Legs got...
[6326.49s -> 6328.09s]  Actually, this might actually help a lot.
[6328.09s -> 6334.50s]  Do you want to eat like a tooth or something?
[6334.50s -> 6346.89s]  Here, eat this stuff.
[6346.89s -> 6347.85s]  They're all so slow.
[6347.85s -> 6353.10s]  They all can't even move.
[6353.10s -> 6353.42s]  They all...
[6353.42s -> 6353.98s]  Look at how...
[6353.98s -> 6355.90s]  Okay, this is the only one that actually walks.
[6355.90s -> 6362.06s]  Go eat a banana.
[6362.06s -> 6362.70s]  Cool.
[6362.70s -> 6363.50s]  How are you doing?
[6363.50s -> 6366.02s]  Very nice.
[6366.02s -> 6367.67s]  Probably need some sleep.
[6367.67s -> 6368.63s]  Go eat some more ham.
[6368.63s -> 6378.23s]  Eat whatever.
[6378.23s -> 6378.87s]  I don't want to do that.
[6378.87s -> 6379.67s]  All right, well, don't.
[6379.67s -> 6388.63s]  This costs money because Spam just keeps eating coconuts over and over again.
[6388.63s -> 6393.94s]  Go eat this like moon cheese thing.
[6393.94s -> 6395.46s]  I want to see some mutations, please.
[6395.46s -> 6405.72s]  But didn't I unlock a new food?
[6405.72s -> 6414.22s]  All right, raw's asleep.
[6415.86s -> 6422.04s]  Can I breed anybody?
[6422.04s -> 6422.92s]  Go to bed.
[6422.92s -> 6427.59s]  I can, but I don't want to yet.
[6427.59s -> 6442.95s]  Everyone's tired.
[6442.95s -> 6444.52s]  Iron fence.
[6444.52s -> 6445.16s]  Fence.
[6445.16s -> 6451.78s]  The good thing is nobody's like kind of...
[6451.78s -> 6452.34s]  Nobody's...
[6452.34s -> 6453.46s]  Everyone's pretty happy.
[6453.46s -> 6463.08s]  Still a few that I haven't found yet.
[6463.08s -> 6463.96s]  A lot, actually.
[6463.96s -> 6466.82s]  Stop destroying the dirt.
[6466.82s -> 6468.73s]  What does the dirt do?
[6468.73s -> 6469.37s]  Why?
[6469.37s -> 6472.54s]  You have to name somebody Macho.
[6472.54s -> 6474.39s]  That's a good idea.
[6474.39s -> 6479.86s]  Put the dirt clumps in the dirt patch.
[6479.86s -> 6495.21s]  What's that stick bug meme?
[6495.21s -> 6496.25s]  Foam cylinder.
[6496.25s -> 6498.60s]  What are you doing?
[6498.60s -> 6501.78s]  Get out of here.
[6501.78s -> 6503.22s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[6503.22s -> 6508.25s]  Stop doing that.
[6508.25s -> 6509.48s]  Don't do that.
[6509.48s -> 6512.90s]  You just woke up your brother.
[6512.90s -> 6518.58s]  Okay, fine.
[6518.58s -> 6523.59s]  Roll over.
[6523.59s -> 6524.55s]  No, you didn't.
[6524.55s -> 6525.43s]  Roll over.
[6525.43s -> 6531.75s]  See, I did it.
[6531.75s -> 6532.55s]  Good job.
[6532.55s -> 6538.95s]  Oh, an egg.
[6538.95s -> 6549.85s]  Does anybody know any tricks?
[6549.85s -> 6551.42s]  Can you do a roll over?
[6551.42s -> 6552.54s]  Wow, you can do it.
[6552.54s -> 6553.34s]  Mud's smart.
[6553.34s -> 6558.09s]  All right, mud.
[6558.09s -> 6559.29s]  Um, you need to go to bed.
[6559.29s -> 6563.05s]  Do you know anything?
[6563.05s -> 6569.45s]  Can you do a roll over?
[6569.45s -> 6570.25s]  You can, wow.
[6570.25s -> 6571.37s]  Actually, they're pretty smart.
[6571.37s -> 6577.46s]  All right, you need to go in here now.
[6577.46s -> 6580.82s]  Just go sleep somewhere.
[6580.82s -> 6581.70s]  Sleep right here.
[6581.70s -> 6585.38s]  Stay away from the incubator.
[6585.38s -> 6587.75s]  That's not for dogs.
[6587.75s -> 6592.33s]  All right, you want to eat.
[6592.33s -> 6593.45s]  You need to mutate, too.
[6593.45s -> 6596.71s]  Eat this like weird cheese.
[6596.71s -> 6601.32s]  Feed somebody a cocoon.
[6601.32s -> 6608.44s]  I can't wait to breed this.
[6608.44s -> 6612.97s]  Sir, hello.
[6612.97s -> 6614.33s]  I'm writing an article for my school paper.
[6614.33s -> 6615.37s]  Would you like to give an explanation
[6615.37s -> 6616.73s]  for the events that occurred three days ago
[6616.73s -> 6618.09s]  during the strawberry magic stream?
[6619.45s -> 6620.57s]  What do you want to know?
[6620.57s -> 6623.00s]  Okay, good.
[6623.00s -> 6623.77s]  Sleep.
[6624.49s -> 6625.13s]  Where are you?
[6625.77s -> 6627.70s]  Where is this?
[6628.81s -> 6629.45s]  No, not yet.
[6638.98s -> 6641.22s]  And all right, what happened?
[6641.78s -> 6647.88s]  Not much.
[6647.88s -> 6648.84s]  Just kind of grew up a little bit.
[6649.56s -> 6656.54s]  All right, so somebody said don't fuck with the dirt, right?
[6656.54s -> 6660.65s]  Just leave the dirt.
[6660.65s -> 6664.98s]  But did you find this?
[6664.98s -> 6666.50s]  This was recommended a bunch of times.
[6666.50s -> 6669.40s]  It's been on the list for a little while.
[6669.40s -> 6671.35s]  I think it's cute.
[6671.35s -> 6672.15s]  I think this is fun.
[6672.15s -> 6675.67s]  All right, spam needs to eat.
[6677.96s -> 6680.15s]  What should I feed you?
[6680.15s -> 6680.87s]  I got something new.
[6680.87s -> 6683.83s]  Yeah, honeycomb.
[6683.83s -> 6685.69s]  Try this if you like it.
[6685.69s -> 6694.87s]  You like it?
[6694.87s -> 6698.25s]  Well, you guys both apparently like that.
[6698.25s -> 6699.69s]  So let's just put another one over here.
[6699.69s -> 6700.97s]  Try it again.
[6700.97s -> 6704.41s]  You look more like a sheep than you a dog.
[6704.41s -> 6709.88s]  Hey, anybody else hungry?
[6709.88s -> 6712.22s]  It's query.
[6713.40s -> 6713.88s]  Who is this?
[6715.19s -> 6717.43s]  Yeah, you go in there and go to sleep.
[6717.43s -> 6721.82s]  You need to sleep.
[6721.82s -> 6722.78s]  All right, let's rock it.
[6722.78s -> 6724.06s]  Raw, eat a honeycomb.
[6724.06s -> 6725.82s]  I feel like that would like fuck you up.
[6725.82s -> 6726.94s]  Like your DNA or whatever.
[6727.50s -> 6731.99s]  It's very nutritious,
[6731.99s -> 6733.19s]  but I feel like it's going to like
[6733.19s -> 6734.15s]  fuck up the DNA stuff.
[6734.15s -> 6737.19s]  It's going to be interesting.
[6737.19s -> 6737.91s]  Sheep.
[6737.91s -> 6740.36s]  All right, now go to sleep.
[6741.48s -> 6748.12s]  Hey, what do we get?
[6750.22s -> 6751.02s]  Berry bros.
[6758.47s -> 6765.99s]  Ooh, just got bigger.
[6765.99s -> 6767.35s]  Body got glossy.
[6769.69s -> 6771.05s]  I think I can breed now.
[6771.61s -> 6773.46s]  Can I?
[6773.46s -> 6776.36s]  No, not yet.
[6776.36s -> 6782.94s]  All right, eat another honeycomb.
[6787.83s -> 6788.63s]  Eat that.
[6788.63s -> 6795.16s]  And then go in the corner and sleep.
[6795.80s -> 6798.50s]  Who else should eat this?
[6799.22s -> 6802.02s]  Okay, mud, come out here and eat this.
[6802.58s -> 6807.13s]  I feel like the honeycomb is going to do really cool stuff.
[6808.46s -> 6809.34s]  Spam can breed.
[6810.22s -> 6811.10s]  They're not on the list, are they?
[6811.50s -> 6812.38s]  Oh, we can, can they?
[6813.18s -> 6815.42s]  Not old enough.
[6815.42s -> 6818.63s]  See, not old enough.
[6824.73s -> 6826.65s]  Mud, eat this.
[6831.11s -> 6832.95s]  Light, loud, and aloof.
[6832.95s -> 6833.45s]  That's fine.
[6834.47s -> 6837.83s]  What are you doing?
[6837.83s -> 6838.33s]  You okay?
[6843.11s -> 6846.09s]  How come there's some...
[6846.09s -> 6847.21s]  Why are they sweaty sometimes?
[6847.93s -> 6861.16s]  Dehydrated tree.
[6861.16s -> 6862.20s]  Let's see what this does.
[6862.20s -> 6870.82s]  Eat this.
[6870.82s -> 6881.45s]  You like it?
[6881.45s -> 6882.49s]  Where is everybody?
[6882.49s -> 6887.58s]  Yeah, you're over there.
[6887.58s -> 6888.86s]  You need to eat something too.
[6891.58s -> 6892.62s]  Dry landscape?
[6892.62s -> 6893.90s]  This is kind of getting out of hand.
[6893.90s -> 6898.97s]  Just eat the dirt.
[6898.97s -> 6902.26s]  Or should we?
[6902.26s -> 6903.06s]  No.
[6903.06s -> 6905.86s]  Let's only give spam.
[6905.86s -> 6906.42s]  What are you doing?
[6906.42s -> 6912.39s]  How about a cut fruit?
[6912.39s -> 6918.31s]  I want a lot of different options, genetics-wise.
[6918.31s -> 6920.54s]  All right, try that.
[6921.10s -> 6936.26s]  You don't like it?
[6936.26s -> 6939.14s]  Vents tool option has something for removing plants.
[6939.14s -> 6939.64s]  Okay.
[6940.02s -> 6940.82s]  Oh, you like it.
[6940.82s -> 6941.32s]  You're fine.
[6941.78s -> 6945.46s]  Did I unlock anything new?
[6945.46s -> 6949.94s]  I got something to do flooring.
[6951.64s -> 6952.52s]  Oh, this thing.
[6952.52s -> 6954.46s]  Put it in the playroom.
[6954.46s -> 6965.67s]  That's kind of huge, but whatever.
[6965.67s -> 6969.64s]  Everyone want to check it out?
[6969.64s -> 6976.63s]  All right, you ready to go?
[6976.63s -> 6977.66s]  Go for it.
[6977.66s -> 6988.73s]  Green shag.
[6988.73s -> 6989.93s]  I think now we can breed.
[6989.93s -> 6999.13s]  I'm gonna go try it out.
[6999.13s -> 7003.96s]  Check out the roller.
[7003.96s -> 7005.46s]  Come on, play.
[7005.46s -> 7005.94s]  I just bought it.
[7005.94s -> 7011.46s]  Come on, play with it.
[7011.46s -> 7015.72s]  Play with it.
[7015.72s -> 7021.38s]  They don't even want to play with it.
[7021.38s -> 7028.33s]  Save the game.
[7028.33s -> 7028.73s]  Yep.
[7028.73s -> 7035.34s]  How are you supposed to play with a big tube?
[7035.34s -> 7035.66s]  I don't know.
[7035.66s -> 7041.27s]  Like you get your, you put your arms up and you put your whole body flush with it.
[7041.27s -> 7045.96s]  And then you put your face down, you grip with your hands and you put your entire,
[7045.96s -> 7051.48s]  you kind of mold all around it and then push forward and like roll, roll, roll, roll.
[7051.48s -> 7062.98s]  But you get on top of it and you do like the, like the run thing, like a big log.
[7062.98s -> 7063.54s]  Oh, no.
[7063.54s -> 7065.50s]  Did that, are you okay?
[7065.50s -> 7066.70s]  Oh, I don't think you like this.
[7067.26s -> 7070.87s]  Are you having fun?
[7076.89s -> 7080.55s]  I don't think this, I don't think Sherbert's having fun doing this.
[7080.55s -> 7082.18s]  Are you?
[7082.18s -> 7082.82s]  Fight it.
[7082.82s -> 7088.18s]  Yeah, have banana.
[7088.18s -> 7104.30s]  You don't do CBD on stream anymore?
[7104.30s -> 7105.18s]  No, not really.
[7105.18s -> 7111.05s]  Okay, what do you got?
[7111.05s -> 7115.48s]  Longer legs.
[7115.48s -> 7116.98s]  You should.
[7116.98s -> 7117.86s]  No, I shouldn't.
[7117.86s -> 7130.70s]  I told you when, when I was playing Saw 2, I could not read an analog clock and I realized
[7130.70s -> 7133.18s]  can't really take like THC in stream.
[7135.16s -> 7136.84s]  I walked in a circle for like an hour.
[7136.84s -> 7143.30s]  It was for, it was a long time.
[7143.30s -> 7151.38s]  Oh, a caterpillar.
[7151.38s -> 7151.94s]  I gotta pee.
[7151.94s -> 7153.56s]  I'll be right back.
[7153.56s -> 7154.04s]  Break time.
[7243.35s -> 7486.31s]  I have returned.
[7486.31s -> 7490.36s]  I wanted to refill my drink too.
[7490.36s -> 7491.80s]  It's hot.
[7495.26s -> 7497.24s]  Crazy thing about Vegas.
[7497.24s -> 7504.30s]  Vegas goes from it being 50 degrees outside to a hundred in three days.
[7504.86s -> 7511.56s]  It's kind of insane.
[7517.46s -> 7525.00s]  Camera, hold on.
[7525.00s -> 7530.04s]  Oh, we can see him.
[7530.04s -> 7547.32s]  How's that?
[7547.32s -> 7547.72s]  Is that better?
[7552.10s -> 7553.86s]  Why do I look gray?
[7553.86s -> 7557.82s]  I look fucking gray.
[7557.82s -> 7571.82s]  All right, there we go.
[7571.82s -> 7572.14s]  That's better.
[7572.14s -> 7572.54s]  Okay.
[7572.54s -> 7576.07s]  I said to add some artificial color.
[7578.95s -> 7579.75s]  You guys don't understand.
[7579.75s -> 7586.33s]  It was like with the ring light off and me just sitting here, I'm, I'm fucking gray.
[7586.33s -> 7589.69s]  I have like dark purple eyes and gray skin.
[7589.69s -> 7593.90s]  But yeah, man, we, we, I had a little bit of flush.
[7593.90s -> 7601.50s]  Oh my God.
[7601.50s -> 7603.26s]  I just, what's been happening?
[7603.26s -> 7603.82s]  Everybody okay?
[7604.38s -> 7608.94s]  I don't think it was paused.
[7608.94s -> 7611.91s]  Ooh, wood paneling.
[7611.91s -> 7612.87s]  Oh, okay.
[7612.87s -> 7616.20s]  Ow.
[7616.20s -> 7618.87s]  Anybody ready to breed?
[7618.87s -> 7619.67s]  Not yet.
[7619.67s -> 7627.72s]  Spam is handsome.
[7627.72s -> 7633.30s]  Yes, but actually I didn't like spam in the beginning, but they're, they're growing on me.
[7638.73s -> 7640.01s]  Oh, somebody pee peed.
[7640.65s -> 7656.60s]  Ooh, cool.
[7656.60s -> 7660.41s]  What's that one?
[7660.41s -> 7661.85s]  Very good boy.
[7662.57s -> 7664.46s]  That was so cute.
[7664.46s -> 7667.77s]  It's okay if you have a tiny head.
[7667.77s -> 7668.65s]  That's fine.
[7668.65s -> 7670.44s]  Roll over.
[7670.44s -> 7676.10s]  All right.
[7676.10s -> 7677.70s]  Well, you haven't, you have fun playing with the dirt.
[7677.70s -> 7680.01s]  You really are like an insect.
[7680.01s -> 7680.49s]  Yeah.
[7680.49s -> 7684.17s]  What is it?
[7684.17s -> 7685.69s]  That was very, very good.
[7685.69s -> 7687.13s]  That was very good.
[7687.13s -> 7692.28s]  Spam is hungry.
[7692.28s -> 7693.40s]  Well, let's feed.
[7693.40s -> 7697.80s]  What a chicken nugget or something.
[7697.80s -> 7699.72s]  Yeah, we haven't, we haven't fed a chicken nugget to anybody.
[7699.72s -> 7700.84s]  What are you looking for?
[7700.84s -> 7702.41s]  What do you want mud?
[7702.41s -> 7703.29s]  You hungry?
[7703.29s -> 7705.27s]  You want something from in here?
[7705.27s -> 7709.96s]  Dehydrated treat.
[7709.96s -> 7710.60s]  What do you want?
[7710.60s -> 7715.80s]  How about an onion ring?
[7715.80s -> 7716.92s]  Oh, you want cheese.
[7716.92s -> 7717.72s]  Okay.
[7717.72s -> 7720.92s]  What about onion ring?
[7720.92s -> 7723.93s]  Yeah.
[7723.93s -> 7733.66s]  Right.
[7733.66s -> 7736.10s]  Oh, I don't know.
[7736.10s -> 7737.86s]  Why did that clip take off so much?
[7737.86s -> 7739.14s]  I don't, I don't understand.
[7739.14s -> 7741.91s]  It's the onion ring thing.
[7741.91s -> 7742.39s]  I don't know.
[7742.39s -> 7743.83s]  Why did they take off so much?
[7743.83s -> 7747.22s]  Grandma, I love you, but what the fuck is this game?
[7747.22s -> 7750.10s]  This is Wobble Dogs and it's on Steam and it is very cute.
[7750.10s -> 7756.06s]  It's very fun and it's fun to play.
[7756.06s -> 7756.78s]  It's just chill.
[7757.58s -> 7759.18s]  I like games like this a lot of times.
[7759.18s -> 7760.94s]  It's just cool to hang out and just play.
[7760.94s -> 7767.59s]  It's a genuine human emotion.
[7767.59s -> 7772.49s]  That's why I mean, this is fun.
[7773.05s -> 7774.25s]  All right.
[7774.25s -> 7775.37s]  Who wants a chicken nugget?
[7775.93s -> 7789.90s]  Are you, you're not eating him, aren't you?
[7789.90s -> 7790.86s]  Earned out car.
[7790.86s -> 7792.14s]  Why would I want to use that?
[7792.14s -> 7800.71s]  You want, you want chicken nugget?
[7800.71s -> 7807.74s]  Oh, this is my chicken nugget.
[7807.74s -> 7809.82s]  That's so, I love that.
[7809.82s -> 7813.88s]  I don't want to eat it.
[7813.88s -> 7815.64s]  I just want to take it with me.
[7815.64s -> 7823.03s]  Well, where are you taking it?
[7823.03s -> 7827.30s]  You should, oh, I, oh, I think,
[7827.30s -> 7829.94s]  I think he's taking it away from everybody
[7829.94s -> 7831.38s]  because he wants to eat in private.
[7832.34s -> 7832.58s]  Yep.
[7832.58s -> 7833.14s]  There he goes.
[7837.03s -> 7837.51s]  Yeah.
[7837.51s -> 7839.03s]  He wants to eat in private.
[7842.52s -> 7843.56s]  You all right?
[7843.56s -> 7846.97s]  How much more private can you get?
[7852.79s -> 7853.43s]  I like mud.
[7861.51s -> 7861.83s]  Yeah.
[7862.90s -> 7863.62s]  What was that?
[7866.92s -> 7876.81s]  Oh, you're going to bury the chicken nugget.
[7876.81s -> 7877.61s]  You should eat it.
[7877.61s -> 7881.94s]  I'm not going to tell him what to do.
[7881.94s -> 7882.50s]  Okay.
[7882.50s -> 7887.22s]  No, you should eat it.
[7887.22s -> 7891.37s]  Eat it because you're hungry.
[7891.37s -> 7899.35s]  Oh, ready for a mutation.
[7899.35s -> 7901.67s]  Sherbert takes a long time to level up here.
[7901.67s -> 7902.47s]  All right.
[7902.47s -> 7908.49s]  What have we got?
[7908.49s -> 7909.21s]  Smaller.
[7909.21s -> 7914.79s]  I think you got smaller.
[7914.79s -> 7916.70s]  Yeah.
[7916.70s -> 7917.50s]  Lower body length.
[7917.50s -> 7923.78s]  A little bit longer legs.
[7923.78s -> 7925.38s]  What happens now to spam?
[7925.38s -> 7932.23s]  He's becoming human.
[7932.23s -> 7941.14s]  Oh, Jesus.
[7941.14s -> 7945.34s]  Even bigger.
[7945.34s -> 7948.70s]  Snout rotation.
[7948.70s -> 7950.31s]  No, actually didn't get bigger.
[7950.31s -> 7958.58s]  Lost a little bit of length in the front but got a little wider.
[7958.58s -> 7965.02s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[7966.02s -> 7967.62s]  But how do we?
[7967.62s -> 7968.50s]  It's okay.
[7968.50s -> 7975.37s]  This is sad.
[7975.37s -> 7976.33s]  I liked mud.
[7976.33s -> 7985.72s]  Okay.
[7985.72s -> 7986.44s]  Mud.
[7986.44s -> 8002.74s]  We're going to breed mud and spam.
[8002.74s -> 8004.02s]  Massive litter.
[8004.02s -> 8005.91s]  Oh, what's that mean?
[8005.91s -> 8009.70s]  I don't know.
[8009.70s -> 8010.50s]  What should we do?
[8010.50s -> 8015.56s]  Should I keep going?
[8015.56s -> 8017.45s]  Should I make a huge dog?
[8017.45s -> 8029.74s]  I don't know.
[8029.74s -> 8030.86s]  Wrong one.
[8030.86s -> 8038.84s]  This one and this one back here has brown ears.
[8038.84s -> 8039.64s]  Let's do that.
[8039.64s -> 8043.75s]  Very cool.
[8043.75s -> 8044.07s]  All right.
[8044.55s -> 8045.75s]  Look at huge eyes.
[8045.75s -> 8045.99s]  All right.
[8045.99s -> 8046.31s]  This one.
[8046.31s -> 8046.87s]  I like this one.
[8046.87s -> 8047.59s]  I want this one.
[8047.59s -> 8049.19s]  I don't want to do anymore.
[8049.19s -> 8050.07s]  This one right here.
[8050.07s -> 8052.12s]  That's the one.
[8052.12s -> 8058.46s]  That's the one.
[8058.46s -> 8062.66s]  This next one I'm going to just go absolutely nuts.
[8066.49s -> 8069.74s]  Don't crack mud's orb.
[8069.74s -> 8071.50s]  Oh, I can memorialize it, right?
[8071.50s -> 8083.50s]  Okay.
[8083.50s -> 8084.38s]  Now we're going to do mud.
[8085.90s -> 8087.10s]  No, we're not going to do mud.
[8087.10s -> 8099.48s]  We'll do squary and spam.
[8099.48s -> 8099.80s]  Whoa.
[8100.62s -> 8101.42s]  Tiny.
[8101.42s -> 8109.43s]  Should I do one of the tiny ones?
[8109.43s -> 8113.40s]  Oh, these don't look that good.
[8113.40s -> 8117.90s]  They're kind of big and small.
[8121.37s -> 8122.65s]  You're having way more fun.
[8122.65s -> 8123.69s]  Actually, but you're bigger.
[8123.77s -> 8135.51s]  Oh, God.
[8142.78s -> 8148.90s]  And this one.
[8148.90s -> 8149.54s]  Oh, God.
[8149.54s -> 8150.58s]  Look at this one.
[8150.58s -> 8153.34s]  Cool.
[8153.34s -> 8153.74s]  All right.
[8153.74s -> 8157.00s]  This one and this.
[8157.00s -> 8157.88s]  The two big ones.
[8157.88s -> 8161.02s]  Now we'll do the little ones.
[8161.02s -> 8167.24s]  This one looks cool.
[8174.38s -> 8175.86s]  Huge.
[8175.86s -> 8176.10s]  All right.
[8176.10s -> 8188.98s]  Now we're going to do the two huge ones.
[8188.98s -> 8189.94s]  Look at how big this one's head.
[8189.94s -> 8192.47s]  Look at this one's huge nose.
[8192.47s -> 8193.62s]  That one.
[8193.62s -> 8195.70s]  Look at how huge this one's nose is.
[8195.70s -> 8206.42s]  No, I like that one.
[8206.42s -> 8208.90s]  I don't want any no different.
[8208.90s -> 8209.30s]  I want it.
[8209.30s -> 8210.10s]  I want that one.
[8210.10s -> 8214.09s]  What is this?
[8214.09s -> 8215.94s]  Where did I get a ball?
[8215.94s -> 8223.78s]  Where's mud?
[8223.78s -> 8226.98s]  They said mud was close to passing away, right?
[8226.98s -> 8229.75s]  Hey, just go to sleep.
[8230.31s -> 8230.55s]  Yeah.
[8230.55s -> 8231.83s]  Mud, go to sleep over here.
[8231.83s -> 8234.09s]  You want like a treat or something?
[8234.09s -> 8236.07s]  Just go lie down over here.
[8236.07s -> 8242.15s]  You can lie down.
[8242.15s -> 8243.42s]  Go on.
[8243.42s -> 8243.74s]  Yeah.
[8243.74s -> 8244.22s]  There you go.
[8244.78s -> 8259.45s]  You should lie down.
[8259.45s -> 8260.17s]  Oh.
[8260.17s -> 8264.71s]  Squarry wants to be with mud at the end here.
[8264.71s -> 8266.63s]  Oh, this is so sad.
[8266.63s -> 8280.07s]  Hey, we're friends.
[8280.07s -> 8281.51s]  Get a massive litter.
[8281.51s -> 8282.23s]  Industrial.
[8282.23s -> 8283.51s]  Ooh, that's probably good.
[8284.07s -> 8285.11s]  Pull them down.
[8285.11s -> 8287.08s]  Okay.
[8287.08s -> 8296.71s]  Well, we're going to leave mud alone.
[8296.71s -> 8297.83s]  Don't eat that shit.
[8297.83s -> 8301.72s]  Stop eating poop.
[8301.72s -> 8302.76s]  Don't eat poop.
[8302.76s -> 8303.80s]  Don't eat poop.
[8303.80s -> 8312.34s]  All right.
[8312.34s -> 8312.98s]  Everyone's hungry.
[8317.40s -> 8319.82s]  What are you looking for?
[8319.82s -> 8321.02s]  No, no like weird shit.
[8321.02s -> 8321.90s]  Just like a burrito.
[8321.90s -> 8322.30s]  We haven't had it.
[8322.30s -> 8326.01s]  Nobody's had a burrito in a while.
[8326.01s -> 8326.97s]  Here, eat this burrito.
[8328.42s -> 8330.66s]  And we'll spawn some like coconuts.
[8330.66s -> 8335.88s]  A little piece of cheese.
[8335.88s -> 8336.84s]  Maybe some french fries.
[8337.96s -> 8338.20s]  Yeah.
[8338.20s -> 8341.30s]  And come up here and eat if you want to eat.
[8341.30s -> 8346.34s]  Eat that burrito.
[8346.34s -> 8348.34s]  Oh, I love the nose.
[8348.34s -> 8356.63s]  How about like schnoz or something?
[8356.63s -> 8358.63s]  Spud?
[8358.63s -> 8361.24s]  Actually, Spud's a good name.
[8361.24s -> 8362.98s]  Spud.
[8362.98s -> 8365.56s]  I love Spud.
[8365.56s -> 8365.80s]  Okay.
[8365.80s -> 8371.82s]  How's it going in here?
[8371.82s -> 8375.11s]  Mud's still okay.
[8375.11s -> 8379.16s]  You want to have some food, mud?
[8379.16s -> 8380.28s]  Defying all odds.
[8380.28s -> 8382.12s]  Mud is still alive.
[8382.12s -> 8385.02s]  Interesting.
[8385.02s -> 8388.71s]  You seriously can't go that far?
[8388.71s -> 8389.83s]  Oh my goodness.
[8389.83s -> 8390.39s]  There you go.
[8390.39s -> 8394.15s]  Eat it.
[8394.15s -> 8395.75s]  And eat like a banana or something too.
[8395.75s -> 8397.18s]  A coconut.
[8397.18s -> 8402.57s]  Not just junk food.
[8402.57s -> 8403.37s]  I have to-
[8403.37s -> 8405.29s]  I forget spam cannot move that fast.
[8405.29s -> 8413.34s]  So have a coconut.
[8413.34s -> 8414.38s]  Wrong dog?
[8414.38s -> 8416.74s]  What do you mean?
[8416.74s -> 8418.31s]  Spud's fine.
[8418.31s -> 8425.42s]  Spud's not hungry.
[8425.42s -> 8426.54s]  Everybody's eating.
[8426.54s -> 8428.49s]  All right.
[8428.49s -> 8429.61s]  Come on out, Mud.
[8429.61s -> 8431.86s]  Let's give Mud a-
[8431.86s -> 8445.13s]  Like a guava or whatever this is.
[8445.13s -> 8449.67s]  Old man.
[8449.67s -> 8456.22s]  Guava puree.
[8456.22s -> 8456.46s]  All right.
[8456.46s -> 8457.74s]  You're kind of just stuck over here.
[8457.74s -> 8462.86s]  Get over here.
[8462.86s -> 8468.33s]  Go play with the other dogs.
[8468.33s -> 8476.68s]  Rude.
[8476.68s -> 8477.48s]  Oh good.
[8477.48s -> 8478.12s]  Squary.
[8478.12s -> 8483.34s]  Delicious.
[8483.34s -> 8489.16s]  And eat a coconut too.
[8489.16s -> 8490.28s]  Oh be careful, Mud.
[8491.24s -> 8493.56s]  You're so close to being like dead.
[8493.56s -> 8494.12s]  That's not-
[8494.12s -> 8494.92s]  That's so scary.
[8494.92s -> 8496.39s]  I don't like when you do that.
[8496.39s -> 8498.14s]  What do you want?
[8498.14s -> 8498.94s]  You want something?
[8498.94s -> 8502.10s]  Why don't you two like play?
[8502.10s -> 8509.05s]  Oh no.
[8509.05s -> 8532.25s]  This is like-
[8532.25s -> 8533.37s]  Actually like it hurts.
[8533.37s -> 8535.10s]  Oh no.
[8535.10s -> 8535.90s]  Why do they have to do that?
[8535.90s -> 8536.94s]  Put his head back on.
[8536.94s -> 8547.54s]  Why does his head have to pop off?
[8547.54s -> 8547.86s]  Okay.
[8547.86s -> 8549.54s]  Now I don't want anyone to eat Mud.
[8549.54s -> 8550.89s]  I don't want that.
[8550.89s -> 8553.99s]  I want Mud's life orb.
[8553.99s -> 8555.00s]  What do I do?
[8560.87s -> 8562.33s]  Just destroy?
[8562.33s -> 8564.76s]  Or should somebody eat him?
[8564.76s -> 8570.81s]  How do I get the orb?
[8570.81s -> 8571.85s]  Squary, get away.
[8571.85s -> 8576.98s]  Somebody has to eat it?
[8576.98s -> 8578.02s]  You have to eat it.
[8578.02s -> 8585.22s]  Squary.
[8586.95s -> 8591.22s]  No, let's have you come up here and eat.
[8591.22s -> 8591.62s]  You-
[8591.62s -> 8592.74s]  Can I pick you up?
[8592.74s -> 8594.74s]  This talk is fucking stupid.
[8596.41s -> 8597.93s]  I think Squary will eat-
[8597.93s -> 8600.09s]  You are all such morons.
[8600.09s -> 8600.33s]  Okay.
[8600.33s -> 8604.79s]  Well, Squary's gonna-
[8604.79s -> 8642.18s]  They were friends, weren't they?
[8642.18s -> 8642.66s]  You just-
[8643.48s -> 8646.15s]  Shit on his-
[8646.15s -> 8646.39s]  All right.
[8646.39s -> 8647.11s]  I want to get-
[8647.11s -> 8648.07s]  I don't like this.
[8648.07s -> 8651.48s]  I want to get rid of this.
[8651.48s -> 8651.88s]  Okay.
[8651.88s -> 8652.92s]  I don't want any-
[8653.88s -> 8654.76s]  I'm just gonna move-
[8655.32s -> 8656.28s]  Get rid of it.
[8656.28s -> 8660.10s]  Right?
[8660.10s -> 8661.14s]  If I destroy-
[8661.14s -> 8661.86s]  Stop!
[8661.86s -> 8663.54s]  Please.
[8663.54s -> 8664.82s]  Somebody has to eat it?
[8668.12s -> 8669.96s]  Bring this weird one up here.
[8669.96s -> 8673.40s]  Where are you?
[8673.40s -> 8675.80s]  Get off of that.
[8675.80s -> 8682.58s]  God.
[8682.58s -> 8682.98s]  All right.
[8682.98s -> 8684.66s]  Just eat this, please.
[8684.66s -> 8689.42s]  I hate this.
[8689.42s -> 8690.62s]  I don't want to eat this.
[8690.62s -> 8706.63s]  Spam, get up there and eat it.
[8706.63s -> 8707.03s]  Stop!
[8710.22s -> 8719.42s]  Okay.
[8719.42s -> 8720.78s]  Don't touch this.
[8720.78s -> 8726.06s]  Okay.
[8726.06s -> 8729.27s]  Memorialize.
[8729.27s -> 8730.94s]  There we go.
[8730.94s -> 8735.80s]  Mud, a good dog.
[8735.80s -> 8736.52s]  Oh.
[8736.52s -> 8748.20s]  He was everyone's friend.
[8748.20s -> 8752.98s]  Okay.
[8752.98s -> 8753.54s]  I want to get-
[8753.54s -> 8754.10s]  I don't-
[8754.10s -> 8755.30s]  I want to get rid of this stuff.
[8755.30s -> 8756.90s]  I don't want people eating this shit.
[8756.90s -> 8761.56s]  Are you okay?
[8761.56s -> 8762.28s]  What's wrong?
[8762.28s -> 8764.31s]  You all right?
[8764.31s -> 8775.86s]  All right.
[8775.86s -> 8776.82s]  Who is this?
[8776.82s -> 8782.62s]  Oh, this was raw.
[8782.62s -> 8787.75s]  Body color going orange here.
[8787.75s -> 8789.43s]  Back top leg length.
[8789.43s -> 8803.35s]  It's actually gonna be hard to walk around, I think.
[8803.35s -> 8810.89s]  Green bamboo wall.
[8810.89s -> 8811.37s]  Cool.
[8811.37s -> 8813.70s]  All right.
[8813.70s -> 8814.58s]  I got eggs now.
[8814.58s -> 8814.98s]  Who else?
[8814.98s -> 8815.46s]  You're up there.
[8815.46s -> 8816.34s]  Spud's up there.
[8816.34s -> 8821.19s]  I think I can incubate the other one, right?
[8821.19s -> 8822.86s]  Yes, I can.
[8822.86s -> 8829.56s]  All right.
[8829.56s -> 8830.76s]  Spud, what'd you get?
[8830.76s -> 8833.62s]  Not a whole lot.
[8840.15s -> 8840.95s]  Eat the cocoon.
[8840.95s -> 8846.20s]  Anybody hungry?
[8846.20s -> 8849.14s]  Turbo can mutate.
[8849.14s -> 8849.64s]  All right.
[8850.50s -> 8851.14s]  Loves to eat.
[8851.78s -> 8852.98s]  Oh, let's just get you going.
[8852.98s -> 8857.74s]  Spud didn't really eat that much.
[8857.74s -> 8863.48s]  Spud's never hungry.
[8863.48s -> 8868.70s]  Honestly, I don't think Spud really eats that much.
[8868.70s -> 8877.98s]  Cocoon?
[8877.98s -> 8878.62s]  Yeah, I am.
[8878.62s -> 8880.06s]  All right.
[8880.06s -> 8881.58s]  I thought that was a french fry on the ground.
[8881.58s -> 8889.94s]  Okay.
[8889.94s -> 8895.77s]  Herbert is getting a little bigger.
[8895.77s -> 8899.74s]  Getting a little glossier.
[8899.74s -> 8903.94s]  Okay.
[8903.94s -> 8904.66s]  Memorial-
[8904.66s -> 8905.94s]  Spooky food dispenser.
[8905.94s -> 8907.38s]  Ooh, we got new food.
[8907.38s -> 8908.39s]  All right.
[8908.39s -> 8908.71s]  What is it?
[8908.71s -> 8909.51s]  Let's check it out.
[8909.51s -> 8910.52s]  All right.
[8910.52s -> 8910.84s]  I need to-
[8912.33s -> 8913.62s]  Let me clean this up.
[8913.62s -> 8913.86s]  Right.
[8913.86s -> 8914.50s]  Like, I don't want to-
[8914.50s -> 8915.46s]  This is more-
[8915.46s -> 8916.02s]  I don't like this.
[8916.02s -> 8923.77s]  This is morbid.
[8923.77s -> 8924.01s]  Okay.
[8924.01s -> 8925.21s]  A new food dispenser.
[8925.21s -> 8932.82s]  Spooky food dispenser.
[8932.82s -> 8934.90s]  I could probably change some decorations up, too.
[8945.78s -> 8946.50s]  Let me move the-
[8946.50s -> 8947.14s]  I don't-
[8947.14s -> 8948.87s]  There's already one of these down there.
[8948.87s -> 8949.75s]  Let's get rid of it.
[8949.75s -> 8954.62s]  I'm very curious about this, though.
[8954.62s -> 8955.54s]  All right.
[8955.54s -> 8956.90s]  So what can I do with this?
[8956.90s -> 8957.22s]  Let me-
[8957.22s -> 8958.10s]  Let's do-
[8958.10s -> 8959.14s]  Let me redecorate it.
[8963.48s -> 8964.36s]  I like this better.
[8964.36s -> 8969.24s]  I like the hot dogs.
[8969.24s -> 8972.86s]  Oh, down in the playroom.
[8972.86s -> 8980.01s]  This thing's kind of annoying.
[8984.78s -> 8991.51s]  This is a fun little thing.
[8991.51s -> 8996.15s]  The car is-
[8996.15s -> 8996.55s]  I kind of-
[8996.55s -> 8998.39s]  I don't know if I like this, but whatever.
[8998.39s -> 8999.34s]  It's variety.
[8999.34s -> 9005.26s]  It's variety.
[9005.26s -> 9011.85s]  Oh, I won't put the fan over here.
[9011.85s -> 9017.90s]  Pull people off.
[9017.90s -> 9018.46s]  How about, like-
[9019.18s -> 9021.96s]  You listen to music, listen to tunes,
[9021.96s -> 9023.30s]  and cool off a little.
[9023.30s -> 9027.22s]  And then maybe, like, a fun little speaker over here or something?
[9027.22s -> 9037.26s]  Yeah, it's like a nice cooling fan.
[9037.26s -> 9037.90s]  Oh.
[9037.90s -> 9042.34s]  All right.
[9042.34s -> 9043.46s]  There is-
[9043.46s -> 9047.16s]  But, um-
[9047.16s -> 9049.48s]  Bubblegum.
[9049.48s -> 9054.28s]  Gumby.
[9054.28s -> 9059.16s]  I don't know, like, Smush.
[9059.16s -> 9063.88s]  Idian Ofnir.
[9063.88s -> 9068.36s]  I like Smush.
[9068.36s -> 9071.02s]  Welcome to the world, Smush.
[9071.02s -> 9075.94s]  How come all the dogs are lazy?
[9079.83s -> 9080.15s]  All right.
[9080.15s -> 9081.43s]  Raw needs some food.
[9081.43s -> 9082.81s]  28 minutes old.
[9082.81s -> 9083.69s]  That's funny.
[9083.69s -> 9085.59s]  All right.
[9085.59s -> 9087.35s]  Go up and eat one of the weird things.
[9087.35s -> 9087.99s]  Where's Raw?
[9087.99s -> 9088.31s]  Where are you?
[9088.31s -> 9088.79s]  There you are.
[9088.79s -> 9100.23s]  Let me see you.
[9100.23s -> 9101.43s]  A gourd?
[9101.43s -> 9102.25s]  Okay.
[9102.25s -> 9103.37s]  Eat a gourd.
[9103.37s -> 9105.48s]  Try this.
[9105.48s -> 9107.70s]  What do you think?
[9107.70s -> 9112.39s]  What does that do?
[9112.39s -> 9119.03s]  Is that new DNA?
[9119.03s -> 9122.39s]  That's very filling, too.
[9122.39s -> 9122.63s]  All right.
[9122.63s -> 9123.67s]  What about, um-
[9123.67s -> 9125.59s]  What about some decorative corn?
[9125.59s -> 9133.91s]  Try that.
[9133.91s -> 9134.79s]  Loud sleeper.
[9134.79s -> 9135.51s]  Geez.
[9135.51s -> 9147.53s]  Raise a dog that lives long enough to become ancient.
[9147.53s -> 9148.97s]  Burnt dog biscuit?
[9148.97s -> 9149.37s]  Wait.
[9149.37s -> 9150.65s]  Who's ancient?
[9150.65s -> 9152.90s]  Oh, Squary.
[9155.18s -> 9156.78s]  Squary is ancient.
[9156.78s -> 9168.06s]  I'll turn that off.
[9168.06s -> 9173.82s]  I fucking hate that.
[9173.82s -> 9177.86s]  Short body and yellow coloration from eating a gourd.
[9177.86s -> 9181.98s]  Do I have any more eggs?
[9181.98s -> 9182.30s]  All right.
[9182.30s -> 9182.94s]  I have-
[9182.94s -> 9184.86s]  Let me see.
[9184.86s -> 9185.42s]  Can I breed?
[9188.07s -> 9188.47s]  I can.
[9188.47s -> 9189.27s]  All right.
[9189.27s -> 9190.07s]  Um-
[9190.15s -> 9191.27s]  Nobody else is old enough yet.
[9191.83s -> 9202.31s]  Okay.
[9202.31s -> 9202.95s]  Spam.
[9202.95s -> 9205.03s]  I want you to eat a candy apple.
[9205.59s -> 9210.42s]  Try that.
[9210.42s -> 9211.06s]  You all right?
[9211.06s -> 9211.94s]  You okay?
[9211.94s -> 9212.82s]  I'm sorry.
[9212.82s -> 9214.10s]  I did not mean to do that.
[9214.10s -> 9214.66s]  Don't bite me.
[9223.90s -> 9226.22s]  Eat the candy apple and the decorative corn.
[9226.22s -> 9228.22s]  Look at that.
[9228.22s -> 9228.78s]  New DNA.
[9231.13s -> 9232.25s]  New DNA.
[9232.25s -> 9236.20s]  Okay.
[9236.20s -> 9237.16s]  I don't think you liked it.
[9237.16s -> 9238.12s]  But you got some DNA.
[9238.12s -> 9238.76s]  What about the corn?
[9238.76s -> 9239.72s]  Do you like decorative corn?
[9240.28s -> 9251.98s]  Try the decorative corn.
[9254.71s -> 9255.35s]  No?
[9255.35s -> 9257.94s]  No?
[9257.94s -> 9262.71s]  Are you okay?
[9262.71s -> 9265.72s]  Kind of.
[9265.72s -> 9266.92s]  Didn't really like that.
[9266.92s -> 9273.00s]  What is this one?
[9274.73s -> 9275.29s]  Uh-
[9275.29s -> 9275.53s]  I just-
[9275.53s -> 9276.57s]  This one here.
[9276.57s -> 9280.02s]  I don't know what the effects are.
[9280.82s -> 9282.28s]  Still don't know the-
[9282.28s -> 9283.32s]  Oh, brown coloration.
[9283.32s -> 9284.28s]  Okay.
[9284.28s -> 9289.18s]  Can I make a centipede?
[9293.42s -> 9294.14s]  Um, okay.
[9294.14s -> 9294.62s]  Who else should-
[9294.62s -> 9295.42s]  Who needs to eat?
[9295.98s -> 9296.70s]  Spud's hungry.
[9296.70s -> 9297.02s]  Oh no!
[9297.02s -> 9297.74s]  What's wrong with Spud?
[9297.74s -> 9298.70s]  His nose is glowing.
[9298.70s -> 9301.05s]  I'll bring him a candy apple.
[9301.05s -> 9319.13s]  All right.
[9319.13s -> 9319.85s]  Hey, Spud.
[9319.85s -> 9322.68s]  Try this.
[9322.68s -> 9328.36s]  Is it hot in here?
[9328.36s -> 9331.13s]  What's wrong with Smush?
[9331.13s -> 9332.41s]  What is-
[9332.41s -> 9333.05s]  Are you okay?
[9333.05s -> 9333.61s]  Oh my god.
[9333.61s -> 9334.57s]  What's wrong with Smush?
[9338.39s -> 9338.95s]  You all right?
[9339.94s -> 9345.78s]  Why are you just in the corner?
[9345.78s -> 9347.93s]  Um-
[9347.93s -> 9348.43s]  Me!
[9349.88s -> 9350.12s]  All right.
[9350.12s -> 9350.92s]  You're fine.
[9350.92s -> 9354.41s]  Need to feed you something though.
[9354.41s -> 9364.52s]  Tech floor.
[9366.65s -> 9367.53s]  Is it really hot in here?
[9367.53s -> 9368.73s]  I'm gonna have a fan going.
[9368.73s -> 9377.35s]  How many people need to sleep?
[9377.35s -> 9381.86s]  All right.
[9381.86s -> 9382.74s]  I need some more food.
[9382.74s -> 9387.14s]  Let's get some gourds.
[9387.14s -> 9388.02s]  Uh-
[9388.02s -> 9390.09s]  Some like chicken and nutri-
[9390.09s -> 9391.29s]  Yeah, sliders.
[9391.29s -> 9393.83s]  Stop.
[9393.83s -> 9394.55s]  Stop it.
[9394.55s -> 9395.86s]  What's going on over here?
[9395.86s -> 9397.05s]  Stop.
[9397.05s -> 9397.69s]  Hey.
[9397.69s -> 9401.32s]  Who's causing a problem?
[9401.32s -> 9403.08s]  Which one?
[9403.08s -> 9404.23s]  Hey.
[9404.23s -> 9405.67s]  That was not very nice.
[9405.67s -> 9409.11s]  That wasn't very nice.
[9409.11s -> 9410.23s]  Get off of him.
[9410.23s -> 9411.66s]  Get off of him.
[9411.66s -> 9414.78s]  That's not nice what you're doing.
[9414.78s -> 9415.74s]  Are you okay?
[9415.74s -> 9416.76s]  Raw.
[9416.76s -> 9420.68s]  That wasn't very nice.
[9420.68s -> 9424.42s]  You hungry?
[9424.42s -> 9425.38s]  Let him up.
[9425.38s -> 9427.61s]  Let him up.
[9427.61s -> 9431.42s]  Let him up.
[9431.42s -> 9431.90s]  Stop!
[9431.90s -> 9433.50s]  Why do you have it out for him so bad?
[9433.50s -> 9435.93s]  Let him up.
[9435.93s -> 9438.22s]  Why?
[9438.22s -> 9438.94s]  Stop it.
[9438.94s -> 9440.22s]  Let him up.
[9440.22s -> 9441.50s]  Don't do that.
[9441.50s -> 9450.44s]  Come over here.
[9450.44s -> 9451.24s]  Stop!
[9451.24s -> 9451.64s]  Hey!
[9453.42s -> 9455.50s]  You sit down right now.
[9455.50s -> 9456.46s]  Sit down over here.
[9457.32s -> 9458.04s]  Excuse me.
[9458.04s -> 9459.51s]  No.
[9459.51s -> 9460.79s]  Sit down.
[9460.79s -> 9461.83s]  Leave Raw alone.
[9461.83s -> 9462.95s]  What did Raw do for-
[9462.95s -> 9463.11s]  What-
[9463.11s -> 9463.75s]  For no reason.
[9465.26s -> 9466.62s]  Don't bite him for no reason.
[9468.38s -> 9469.10s]  He's still-
[9469.10s -> 9469.50s]  All right.
[9469.50s -> 9470.46s]  Raw.
[9470.46s -> 9471.26s]  Raw, come here.
[9472.66s -> 9473.78s]  Raw, we're gonna put you over here.
[9473.78s -> 9474.42s]  You're gonna-
[9474.42s -> 9474.58s]  Here.
[9474.58s -> 9475.22s]  Here's a gourd.
[9477.75s -> 9478.47s]  Here.
[9478.47s -> 9480.09s]  Try that.
[9481.40s -> 9482.04s]  No, don't leave.
[9482.04s -> 9482.20s]  Don't-
[9482.20s -> 9486.52s]  No, you idiot.
[9486.52s -> 9488.76s]  You can't just, like, dominate this space.
[9488.76s -> 9489.48s]  The problem is...
[9491.32s -> 9495.43s]  Spam is territorially claiming the food room.
[9495.43s -> 9496.95s]  Maybe I shouldn't have a food room.
[9496.95s -> 9500.04s]  It seems like it's causing problems.
[9500.04s -> 9504.18s]  Because he's claiming this is territory.
[9504.18s -> 9523.40s]  Are you ho-
[9523.40s -> 9524.12s]  Come over here.
[9524.12s -> 9525.16s]  Go in front of the fan.
[9526.74s -> 9527.62s]  Right here.
[9527.62s -> 9533.67s]  Can you not stay there?
[9533.67s -> 9533.91s]  All right.
[9533.91s -> 9534.79s]  I'm just gonna hold you here.
[9534.79s -> 9535.91s]  Because you're, like, sweating.
[9536.47s -> 9541.56s]  Okay.
[9541.56s -> 9542.28s]  He's sweating.
[9543.72s -> 9544.12s]  All right.
[9544.12s -> 9546.17s]  Here comes the mean one.
[9546.17s -> 9546.73s]  Are you done?
[9549.64s -> 9551.16s]  Go sleep in the playroom.
[9551.16s -> 9553.19s]  Go sleep in the playroom.
[9555.93s -> 9556.33s]  Come here.
[9556.89s -> 9559.94s]  Eat a banana.
[9559.94s -> 9562.10s]  And then go to sleep in the playroom.
[9562.10s -> 9568.46s]  Okay.
[9568.46s -> 9573.06s]  Now go over here and go to bed.
[9573.06s -> 9573.86s]  You're being bad.
[9573.86s -> 9577.77s]  Now go sleep over there.
[9577.77s -> 9578.97s]  And leave everybody alone.
[9578.97s -> 9589.80s]  We got a ton of mutations coming.
[9589.80s -> 9593.67s]  Just smush.
[9593.67s -> 9595.85s]  Got a green nose now.
[9595.85s -> 9598.71s]  Aw, that's so cute.
[9598.71s -> 9600.31s]  Back leg stance width.
[9600.31s -> 9601.58s]  More of a-
[9601.58s -> 9603.61s]  A little width there.
[9603.61s -> 9607.30s]  Very shiny.
[9607.30s -> 9610.06s]  Very nice.
[9610.06s -> 9610.86s]  What about you?
[9610.86s -> 9622.04s]  Turns-
[9622.04s -> 9622.92s]  It's all-
[9622.92s -> 9623.96s]  It's all yellow.
[9623.96s -> 9630.28s]  Interesting.
[9630.28s -> 9630.68s]  All right.
[9630.68s -> 9631.80s]  Got even longer.
[9631.80s -> 9634.86s]  This is like a banana now.
[9634.86s -> 9640.54s]  What's going on in here?
[9640.54s -> 9641.66s]  Why are they all fighting?
[9641.66s -> 9642.62s]  Stop fighting.
[9642.62s -> 9646.46s]  Smush.
[9646.46s -> 9647.10s]  Stop it.
[9647.10s -> 9650.10s]  Everybody relax.
[9650.10s -> 9650.66s]  Relax.
[9650.66s -> 9652.26s]  You're both very good dogs.
[9652.26s -> 9658.90s]  All right.
[9658.90s -> 9659.38s]  You're back.
[9659.38s -> 9659.78s]  You're-
[9659.78s -> 9660.58s]  You're okay.
[9660.58s -> 9673.00s]  I wonder, can I breed now?
[9673.00s -> 9673.48s]  You don't.
[9674.46s -> 9674.86s]  This-
[9674.86s -> 9676.07s]  All right.
[9676.07s -> 9677.43s]  Raw is kind of scary.
[9677.43s -> 9686.34s]  He's having a good time.
[9686.34s -> 9687.06s]  So whatever.
[9687.06s -> 9694.63s]  He's rolling around and pee.
[9694.63s -> 9705.43s]  Sherbert hasn't really changed that much.
[9705.43s -> 9707.91s]  We can breed though.
[9707.91s -> 9712.15s]  A little more gloss.
[9712.15s -> 9713.45s]  A little bit bigger.
[9713.45s -> 9717.46s]  Back bottom leg length.
[9717.46s -> 9718.66s]  That's actually going to be concerning.
[9719.94s -> 9720.50s]  The legs-
[9720.50s -> 9721.78s]  His back legs are too long.
[9721.78s -> 9726.36s]  All right.
[9726.36s -> 9727.48s]  I think it's time to breed.
[9727.48s -> 9730.10s]  We have a few adults here.
[9730.10s -> 9730.66s]  Yellow.
[9730.66s -> 9731.38s]  Here.
[9731.38s -> 9736.81s]  Okay.
[9736.81s -> 9740.09s]  Spud.
[9740.09s -> 9741.77s]  Front bottom leg length.
[9741.77s -> 9744.70s]  Interesting.
[9744.70s -> 9747.45s]  40 percent.
[9747.45s -> 9750.04s]  Smaller ears.
[9750.04s -> 9751.32s]  Body metallic.
[9751.32s -> 9759.85s]  His front legs are too long.
[9759.85s -> 9761.45s]  Eat 10 clumps of dirt.
[9761.45s -> 9764.73s]  Mud floor.
[9764.73s -> 9765.13s]  All right.
[9765.13s -> 9765.61s]  It's time.
[9766.73s -> 9769.46s]  I got an egg here.
[9769.46s -> 9770.58s]  We're going to do raw.
[9772.06s -> 9772.54s]  And I don't know.
[9772.54s -> 9772.94s]  Who else?
[9774.70s -> 9777.85s]  Spam.
[9777.85s -> 9782.28s]  Raw or maybe raw and Sherbert.
[9782.28s -> 9783.40s]  But raw and spud.
[9783.40s -> 9785.43s]  Squire.
[9785.43s -> 9788.14s]  Spud's not old enough.
[9788.14s -> 9789.50s]  We get something interesting here.
[9789.50s -> 9797.16s]  Or these two.
[9797.16s -> 9797.72s]  Go.
[9797.72s -> 9803.40s]  All right.
[9803.40s -> 9805.48s]  Somehow this one has an even smaller head.
[9805.48s -> 9809.00s]  Look at this one.
[9809.00s -> 9811.29s]  The legs are so long.
[9817.93s -> 9819.38s]  And probably the-
[9819.38s -> 9820.50s]  This one just like the-
[9820.50s -> 9821.06s]  This one here.
[9832.28s -> 9833.32s]  Even longer.
[9833.32s -> 9838.10s]  Remember, this is unethical.
[9850.38s -> 9850.78s]  Whoa!
[9853.53s -> 9855.45s]  Oh, I think this is it, right?
[9855.45s -> 9857.37s]  Should I keep going or should I breed this one?
[9857.93s -> 9858.81s]  Look at that.
[9858.81s -> 9861.90s]  That's like a Giga Chad.
[9866.17s -> 9867.37s]  I think I keep this one.
[9867.37s -> 9872.90s]  I'm going to keep this one.
[9872.90s -> 9875.62s]  One, two, three, four, five, six legs.
[9875.62s -> 9876.58s]  This one can actually walk.
[9885.91s -> 9886.47s]  Name this one.
[9886.47s -> 9888.70s]  Imposter.
[9888.70s -> 9890.49s]  Aw.
[9890.49s -> 9891.85s]  Smush loves the playroom.
[9893.62s -> 9894.34s]  He's having trouble.
[9894.34s -> 9895.54s]  He's like, I don't know what to do with this ball.
[9896.10s -> 9898.44s]  Why can't I pick the ball up with my mouth?
[9898.44s -> 9898.92s]  It's not fair.
[9900.30s -> 9901.02s]  It's too heavy.
[9902.39s -> 9902.89s]  What?
[9908.66s -> 9909.46s]  Who just did that?
[9915.45s -> 9916.41s]  Oh, Smush.
[9916.41s -> 9917.61s]  You're having such a good time.
[9919.22s -> 9920.74s]  Oh, Smush is hoarding.
[9922.58s -> 9923.14s]  I get it.
[9923.14s -> 9923.94s]  Okay.
[9923.94s -> 9928.34s]  Smush, it might be my new favorite.
[9928.34s -> 9941.26s]  Spud has not left the top right corner
[9941.26s -> 9943.10s]  the whole time we've been playing the entire time.
[9950.90s -> 9952.34s]  Oh, got your own food.
[9952.82s -> 9956.06s]  All right.
[9956.06s -> 9956.86s]  It's a mess up here.
[9957.42s -> 9958.30s]  What are you doing?
[9958.30s -> 9959.66s]  I'm sure about how you're doing.
[9959.66s -> 9962.92s]  Just playing.
[9962.92s -> 9964.44s]  Oh, you're building.
[9966.82s -> 9967.62s]  Very smart.
[9969.48s -> 9970.60s]  Very smart.
[9970.60s -> 9972.12s]  Okay.
[9972.84s -> 9973.86s]  Very good.
[9973.86s -> 9974.34s]  Do that again.
[9975.82s -> 9977.02s]  Very, very good.
[9977.02s -> 9978.06s]  Very smart.
[9978.06s -> 9984.42s]  It's a mess up here.
[9984.42s -> 9995.45s]  I got a reward for throwing up.
[9995.45s -> 9997.69s]  Garlic bulb.
[9997.69s -> 10002.54s]  Want some garlic?
[10002.54s -> 10009.40s]  I'm going to feed the gar-
[10009.40s -> 10010.28s]  Smush.
[10010.28s -> 10013.80s]  Do you want some garlic, Smush?
[10013.80s -> 10014.28s]  Oh, no.
[10014.28s -> 10015.64s]  He's like sweating.
[10017.21s -> 10018.33s]  Stop doing that.
[10018.33s -> 10019.45s]  You guys are going to get hurt.
[10019.45s -> 10022.28s]  I think everyone's hungry.
[10022.36s -> 10026.02s]  Try some garlic.
[10026.02s -> 10026.98s]  It's good for you.
[10026.98s -> 10029.03s]  Well, no, it's not good for dogs,
[10029.03s -> 10031.11s]  but like in the sense of out of context.
[10036.57s -> 10037.85s]  Smush wants to eat that, yeah.
[10040.58s -> 10041.54s]  Yeah, do not-
[10041.54s -> 10042.42s]  Okay, what is it?
[10044.44s -> 10045.24s]  Shallots?
[10045.24s -> 10046.36s]  Like onions, garlic.
[10047.86s -> 10049.14s]  Anything that's like a shallot, right?
[10049.78s -> 10053.29s]  That was like cool, so I'm going to praise you.
[10057.64s -> 10061.08s]  Onions, garlic, grapes, chocolate.
[10061.72s -> 10064.10s]  There's actually a lot of things your dog really can't have.
[10064.66s -> 10068.31s]  What's wrong?
[10068.31s -> 10069.80s]  You all right?
[10069.80s -> 10072.87s]  Something healthy.
[10073.85s -> 10079.45s]  There, like eat like a nutrition pellet.
[10080.71s -> 10081.11s]  You okay?
[10082.18s -> 10087.48s]  Try that.
[10087.48s -> 10088.60s]  Yeah, eat something that's good for you.
[10092.14s -> 10095.30s]  You know, there's some garlic.
[10100.50s -> 10101.54s]  Dave, oh my god.
[10102.18s -> 10107.38s]  All right, new friend available, I think.
[10115.32s -> 10116.04s]  Tremendous.
[10116.04s -> 10117.00s]  That's actually a really good name.
[10120.57s -> 10121.53s]  Snacks.
[10121.53s -> 10122.01s]  Chowder.
[10122.74s -> 10123.62s]  Scout.
[10123.62s -> 10124.12s]  Damper.
[10126.73s -> 10127.23s]  Porn.
[10129.00s -> 10129.88s]  Steak fry.
[10131.58s -> 10132.08s]  Tuba?
[10132.62s -> 10134.06s]  I like tuba.
[10134.06s -> 10139.48s]  Okay, tuba.
[10139.48s -> 10140.20s]  What are you going to eat?
[10140.20s -> 10141.32s]  How about some healthy stuff?
[10141.80s -> 10143.24s]  How about a coconut?
[10143.24s -> 10143.74s]  No, a...
[10148.28s -> 10149.08s]  I don't know.
[10149.08s -> 10150.66s]  What should we...
[10150.66s -> 10151.22s]  Come over here.
[10151.22s -> 10152.98s]  I want you over here.
[10157.08s -> 10157.72s]  Cityscape.
[10157.72s -> 10158.52s]  Ooh, let me try that.
[10167.58s -> 10169.50s]  Uh-oh, Spam is getting older.
[10169.50s -> 10173.75s]  Okay, Spam's getting old.
[10173.75s -> 10175.19s]  That's not bad.
[10178.17s -> 10178.73s]  Where's Spam?
[10180.31s -> 10180.87s]  What's Spud?
[10180.87s -> 10181.59s]  Spud's hungry.
[10182.39s -> 10185.67s]  I'm going to eat this.
[10185.67s -> 10187.83s]  I know, Spud has trouble like moving around, right?
[10187.83s -> 10192.98s]  Where's Spam?
[10193.54s -> 10195.96s]  All right, Spam's getting old.
[10195.96s -> 10196.92s]  We're going to have to breed Spam.
[10197.48s -> 10201.40s]  I need an egg.
[10201.40s -> 10204.25s]  Spam was mean.
[10204.25s -> 10207.27s]  This is penance.
[10207.27s -> 10209.77s]  Tuba is currently...
[10213.77s -> 10214.57s]  I think they're playing.
[10220.65s -> 10221.85s]  Tuba's just a puppy, though.
[10226.30s -> 10230.15s]  Um, Spud, are you...
[10230.15s -> 10232.52s]  Oh, an egg.
[10232.52s -> 10233.56s]  All right, stop, stop, stop.
[10233.56s -> 10234.36s]  That's enough, that's enough.
[10234.36s -> 10235.16s]  That's enough, that's enough.
[10235.16s -> 10236.60s]  Let go, let go, let go, let go.
[10236.60s -> 10237.10s]  Let go.
[10243.34s -> 10244.14s]  Oh, okay.
[10244.14s -> 10248.71s]  I was like, what happened?
[10248.71s -> 10250.07s]  All right, it's okay, Spud.
[10250.07s -> 10253.78s]  It's okay.
[10253.78s -> 10260.34s]  Go sleep next to your brother.
[10260.34s -> 10261.94s]  All right, ooh, sofa.
[10261.94s -> 10267.96s]  Can you not sleep here?
[10267.96s -> 10273.91s]  Take a nap.
[10273.91s -> 10277.26s]  Sleep.
[10277.26s -> 10277.76s]  Go to sleep.
[10283.82s -> 10285.26s]  What is going on over here?
[10286.78s -> 10287.98s]  Leave each other alone.
[10288.54s -> 10292.95s]  Stop it.
[10292.95s -> 10293.99s]  Who is that?
[10293.99s -> 10295.51s]  Smush, leave him.
[10295.51s -> 10301.29s]  Put him down.
[10301.29s -> 10302.44s]  Enough.
[10302.44s -> 10303.24s]  It's okay.
[10303.24s -> 10307.24s]  Smush, that's enough.
[10307.24s -> 10314.68s]  All right, sure.
[10314.68s -> 10315.64s]  We'll eat this.
[10315.64s -> 10320.42s]  Put him down?
[10320.42s -> 10321.54s]  Yeah, no, I mean, like, put him down.
[10321.54s -> 10322.10s]  Like, put him...
[10322.10s -> 10323.38s]  He's holding him.
[10323.38s -> 10326.81s]  How do you clean the dogs?
[10326.81s -> 10329.29s]  Is it filthy?
[10329.29s -> 10330.73s]  Is that why they keep on sweating?
[10330.73s -> 10338.01s]  Smush, you're kind of a psycho.
[10338.01s -> 10344.10s]  Here, have some of that.
[10344.10s -> 10351.85s]  All right, we need to do some breeding.
[10351.85s -> 10352.35s]  I got eggs.
[10356.74s -> 10362.49s]  All right, now we're going to do raw and Spam.
[10362.49s -> 10365.16s]  I think that makes some sense.
[10365.16s -> 10371.69s]  And we're going to go to, like, zero with this one.
[10371.69s -> 10376.18s]  Let me see what we can make here.
[10376.18s -> 10387.61s]  This one has a...
[10387.61s -> 10388.97s]  Look at this, how small this one's head is.
[10392.39s -> 10393.75s]  All right, that's interesting.
[10393.75s -> 10403.96s]  I'm moving around.
[10403.96s -> 10405.24s]  All right, getting weirder.
[10405.24s -> 10426.97s]  Still at 98% stability.
[10426.97s -> 10437.27s]  Huge, huge legs too, yeah.
[10437.27s -> 10440.38s]  Green.
[10440.38s -> 10441.34s]  All right, let's do this.
[10442.14s -> 10445.77s]  And I don't know, one of the big ones?
[10445.77s -> 10446.57s]  Probably, yeah.
[10446.57s -> 10455.00s]  Hell yeah, there we go.
[10455.00s -> 10457.59s]  Interesting, I like that one.
[10457.59s -> 10466.01s]  And I like this one.
[10466.01s -> 10468.09s]  This one, this one's kind of just like...
[10468.09s -> 10480.87s]  This one's getting kind of walked over.
[10480.87s -> 10481.83s]  All right, how about this one?
[10483.85s -> 10490.60s]  And this one.
[10490.60s -> 10491.40s]  Whoa, okay.
[10492.54s -> 10494.62s]  They kind of look like a truck.
[10494.62s -> 10503.50s]  Getting something interesting, that's for sure.
[10503.50s -> 10508.09s]  How many legs do they have?
[10508.09s -> 10513.75s]  Looks like a garbage truck.
[10525.58s -> 10526.08s]  Whoa!
[10527.51s -> 10532.14s]  Okay, I'm going to keep going.
[10532.14s -> 10558.87s]  This is the one.
[10558.87s -> 10563.58s]  John Deere.
[10563.58s -> 10567.00s]  Okay, again, we're going to do...
[10567.00s -> 10567.56s]  Should I wait?
[10568.62s -> 10574.63s]  What about Spam and Squary?
[10574.63s -> 10585.62s]  Let's see if we can get something cool here.
[10585.62s -> 10586.82s]  Kind of cool already.
[10586.82s -> 10593.10s]  One with a huge nose.
[10595.05s -> 10598.01s]  I want a dog with, like, a giant, like, nose.
[10612.71s -> 10615.77s]  Where's the biggest nose here?
[10615.77s -> 10622.65s]  Probably you.
[10622.65s -> 10625.03s]  You, it's getting a little longer.
[10625.03s -> 10629.77s]  I think you also have the big one.
[10629.77s -> 10639.66s]  Okay, I like the guy in the middle here.
[10639.66s -> 10650.34s]  And you, keep going, keep going.
[10650.34s -> 10658.10s]  Getting a lot paler.
[10658.10s -> 10667.64s]  Uh-oh.
[10667.64s -> 10671.24s]  Whoa, look at the tail!
[10671.24s -> 10673.48s]  That tail is huge.
[10673.48s -> 10683.03s]  Okay, hold on.
[10683.03s -> 10684.55s]  Oh, wow, that's awesome.
[10684.55s -> 10687.24s]  Okay, I think I stick with one here.
[10687.24s -> 10692.12s]  Or do I keep going?
[10692.12s -> 10696.79s]  Where's the longest tail?
[10696.79s -> 10707.78s]  I think this is the one.
[10707.78s -> 10715.27s]  I think it's this one here.
[10715.27s -> 10715.91s]  One more?
[10715.91s -> 10721.58s]  All right, one more.
[10721.58s -> 10729.78s]  We lost the color.
[10729.78s -> 10730.34s]  Shit.
[10730.34s -> 10731.80s]  All right, one more.
[10738.50s -> 10739.14s]  All right, we got one.
[10739.14s -> 10743.90s]  We got one.
[10743.90s -> 10744.38s]  That was it.
[10744.38s -> 10748.20s]  Did you see that move?
[10748.20s -> 10749.24s]  They're perfect.
[10749.24s -> 10775.80s]  These are, these are wildly different.
[10776.76s -> 10777.88s]  We're gonna have to do some incubation here.
[10777.88s -> 10779.51s]  Okay.
[10779.51s -> 10780.63s]  How are people doing?
[10780.63s -> 10781.51s]  People hungry?
[10781.51s -> 10783.22s]  Anybody dying?
[10783.22s -> 10788.98s]  Some food if you want it.
[10788.98s -> 10799.80s]  How are you guys doing?
[10799.80s -> 10800.60s]  Eat some food.
[10800.60s -> 10802.04s]  Everybody needs to get up there and eat.
[10802.04s -> 10807.37s]  You can't just, like, sit down here.
[10807.37s -> 10808.89s]  All right, so, Spike.
[10808.89s -> 10813.85s]  How about, um, people saying courage?

[11580.07s -> 11586.97s]  I'll leave like a patch over here.
[11586.97s -> 11593.19s]  I'm realizing how fucking filthy it is here.
[11593.19s -> 11597.08s]  It's no wonder they're all dripping and sweaty and sick and stuff.
[11597.08s -> 11599.13s]  Underneath all the grass,
[11599.13s -> 11605.27s]  it's been a bunch of puke and piss and shit.

[11652.68s -> 11657.24s]  They are launching out of the tube and sliding across all this filth.
[11661.88s -> 11668.09s]  Okay, oh my god, what a joke.
[11668.81s -> 11676.98s]  Maybe that's why they're not living that long.
[11676.98s -> 11689.58s]  It was under the, how was I supposed to see it?
[11689.58s -> 11690.46s]  It was under the grass.
[11691.18s -> 11704.94s]  Shit everywhere.
[11708.12s -> 11708.68s]  Jesus!
[11711.05s -> 11712.89s]  Sometimes they move way too fast.
[11712.89s -> 11724.17s]  I hope they can't get injured that way.
[11732.20s -> 11733.80s]  You can't even see it under here.
[11733.80s -> 11738.18s]  How was I supposed to see this?
[11738.18s -> 11740.26s]  Okay, that's much cleaner.
[11740.26s -> 11741.82s]  Looks much better.
[11741.82s -> 11751.08s]  What about the other rooms?
[11751.08s -> 11766.68s]  That's fine.
[11766.68s -> 11767.08s]  That's fine.
[11767.08s -> 11768.68s]  Okay, I need the other rooms now.
[11768.68s -> 11774.95s]  There's a bunch of, yeah, there's like piss and shit everywhere in here too.

[11792.09s -> 11793.13s]  Stop doing that.
[11793.13s -> 11797.26s]  They're starving.
[11797.26s -> 11798.46s]  Oh fuck, they are.

[11810.09s -> 11810.81s]  Eat something.
[11812.26s -> 11817.30s]  Why, what?
[11817.30s -> 11818.10s]  Good, good, good.
[11818.10s -> 11818.98s]  Okay, you're good, you're good.
[11818.98s -> 11820.18s]  Everything's fine.
[11820.18s -> 11826.07s]  This one, good, okay.
[11826.07s -> 11830.70s]  Stop fighting and eat.
[11830.70s -> 11844.52s]  Put him down.
[11844.52s -> 11848.41s]  Oh shit, where are you?
[11848.41s -> 11850.94s]  Stop fighting.
[11850.94s -> 11852.38s]  Stop fighting and eat.
[11852.38s -> 11854.76s]  Both of you.
[11854.76s -> 11857.69s]  Hey, put him down.
[11857.69s -> 11861.64s]  Spud, put him down.
[11861.64s -> 11862.44s]  That's it.

[11875.24s -> 11875.88s]  Let him go.
[11877.19s -> 11878.07s]  How do I stop?
[11880.14s -> 11881.02s]  Let him go.
[11883.26s -> 11884.22s]  Who has who?
[11885.38s -> 11886.58s]  Oh my god, it's not you.
[11886.58s -> 11887.06s]  It's you.
[11889.48s -> 11892.71s]  Put him down.
[11892.71s -> 11893.75s]  Oh my god.
[11896.63s -> 11902.41s]  No, he sounds like a Minecraft zombie.

[11913.69s -> 11914.65s]  It's okay.
[11914.65s -> 11922.76s]  What do you want?
[11922.76s -> 11925.56s]  You want anything else for food before you do pupate?
[11925.56s -> 11927.72s]  Come here.
[11927.72s -> 11929.00s]  Um, have another banana.
[11929.32s -> 11930.52s]  No, you like coconuts, don't you?
[11932.31s -> 11932.87s]  Here.
[11932.87s -> 11936.20s]  Wait, this is dirt.
[11936.20s -> 11938.65s]  Have some honey.
[11938.65s -> 11943.03s]  Spud is not happy right now.
[11943.03s -> 11948.18s]  There you go.
[11948.18s -> 11954.26s]  Okay.
[11954.26s -> 11957.29s]  All right, now go relax.
[11957.29s -> 11959.14s]  You.
[11959.14s -> 11960.50s]  You're in big trouble.
[11960.50s -> 11963.21s]  You're in big trouble.
[11970.26s -> 11972.02s]  Smush.
[11972.02s -> 11973.38s]  He's trying to sit there.
[11973.38s -> 11974.26s]  He's so hungry.
[11975.54s -> 11977.14s]  Oh my god, what do I do?
[11977.14s -> 11978.66s]  Quick, quick, quick.
[11978.66s -> 11979.62s]  Please move out of the way.
[11981.51s -> 11982.39s]  Chicken nuggets and shit.
[11982.39s -> 11983.35s]  Here, eat a chicken nugget.
[11984.23s -> 11985.11s]  I know you want to eat it.
[11985.11s -> 11985.91s]  I know, I know, I know.
[11985.91s -> 11986.39s]  Here, here, here.
[11986.39s -> 11987.51s]  Chicken nugget, eat it.
[11987.51s -> 11989.00s]  Have some garlic.
[11989.88s -> 11990.84s]  Have some garlic, quick.
[11992.18s -> 11993.22s]  Have some garlic.
[11996.39s -> 11998.47s]  Get off the center focus.
[11998.47s -> 11999.35s]  Eat some garlic.
[12001.27s -> 12002.31s]  Eat some garlic, please.
[12003.64s -> 12004.44s]  And chicken nugget.
[12004.44s -> 12007.32s]  You, where are you?
[12007.32s -> 12009.16s]  You have this food in front of you right now.
[12009.16s -> 12012.82s]  Eat it.
[12012.82s -> 12013.30s]  Move him.
[12014.66s -> 12016.10s]  It's in front of you.
[12017.13s -> 12019.27s]  Eat it, it's right here.
[12019.27s -> 12020.15s]  What's wrong with him?
[12021.29s -> 12021.77s]  Eat that.
[12031.53s -> 12032.89s]  Somebody just farted.
[12032.89s -> 12033.85s]  Who does it?
[12033.85s -> 12034.57s]  I gotta relax.
[12044.12s -> 12045.16s]  I'm sorry.
[12045.16s -> 12046.28s]  I'm sorry.
[12046.36s -> 12047.32s]  I'm sorry.
[12047.32s -> 12048.04s]  I'm sorry.
[12048.04s -> 12048.92s]  What do you want to eat?
[12062.57s -> 12063.93s]  This camera is kind of, come on.
[12064.86s -> 12065.34s]  Eat that.
[12066.06s -> 12067.42s]  Stop jumping around and piss.
[12073.34s -> 12074.78s]  Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it.
[12074.78s -> 12076.30s]  Eat, eat, it's delicious, isn't it?
[12076.30s -> 12077.18s]  Okay, we need some more, we do,
[12077.18s -> 12078.54s]  something, that's not just junk food.
[12082.17s -> 12088.02s]  There we go, all right, all right, all right.
[12088.02s -> 12090.74s]  Very good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[12090.74s -> 12091.38s]  Very good.
[12091.94s -> 12093.06s]  Very good, it's okay.
[12093.06s -> 12093.46s]  Very good.
[12094.65s -> 12095.69s]  I was too busy cleaning.
[12095.69s -> 12097.29s]  I didn't realize all this shit was going on up here.
[12098.81s -> 12099.53s]  Everybody all right?
[12111.30s -> 12113.14s]  I need to, can I hire someone?
[12113.86s -> 12115.46s]  You've been doing this for like an hour.
[12117.00s -> 12119.56s]  Honest to God, Raw has been doing this
[12119.56s -> 12121.00s]  for like a full hour in the game.
[12144.50s -> 12146.34s]  I don't think Raw can walk.
[12146.90s -> 12152.63s]  Oh my goodness.
[12154.47s -> 12156.39s]  No, get away from this, stop.
[12157.03s -> 12196.92s]  All right, now go to sleep.
[12196.92s -> 12198.60s]  Not seeing very much growth here.
[12198.60s -> 12200.68s]  Squarie is getting old.
[12200.68s -> 12203.56s]  Okay, all right, I need to see some growth here.
[12203.56s -> 12209.46s]  All right, that was tuba.
[12209.46s -> 12214.86s]  We wanted tuba to shrink, which we did.
[12214.86s -> 12216.14s]  Lost a little bit of size.
[12216.14s -> 12221.42s]  Okay, that's what we wanted.
[12221.42s -> 12234.87s]  Hey John, okay.
[12234.87s -> 12236.47s]  Legs got a little thicker, that's good.
[12236.47s -> 12239.38s]  All right, courage.
[12239.38s -> 12243.51s]  I kind of screwed up courage a little bit
[12243.51s -> 12246.30s]  because I was trying to do nose and ears, right?
[12246.86s -> 12248.54s]  It seems like color is kind of changing a little bit.
[12250.22s -> 12251.74s]  No size went up 10% though.
[12251.74s -> 12252.30s]  That's huge.
[12254.25s -> 12254.57s]  Huge.
[12257.58s -> 12258.94s]  Okay, I need to start storing people
[12258.94s -> 12260.78s]  because I don't have enough space.
[12260.78s -> 12265.14s]  I'm going to store Squarie.
[12265.14s -> 12267.82s]  I'm going to store two people.
[12267.82s -> 12270.38s]  I'm running out of real estate here.
[12270.38s -> 12281.40s]  Let's give you like a coconut or something
[12281.40s -> 12283.48s]  and then we're going to put you in the storage unit.
[12284.20s -> 12289.32s]  We're going to try to try that.
[12289.32s -> 12291.00s]  Eat that before I put you in the storage.
[12291.64s -> 12299.80s]  Why are they so dumb?
[12300.44s -> 12307.80s]  Just eat it.
[12312.58s -> 12318.87s]  Okay, who is going?
[12318.87s -> 12319.99s]  I need to go to my menu here.
[12319.99s -> 12320.95s]  Okay, storage.
[12322.62s -> 12327.45s]  I'm going to take Squarie.
[12327.45s -> 12330.14s]  We're going to store Squarie.
[12330.14s -> 12332.97s]  Who else do I want to store for now?
[12334.28s -> 12335.16s]  I want courage out there.
[12335.16s -> 12335.88s]  I want John out there.
[12335.88s -> 12336.84s]  I want Ra out there.
[12336.84s -> 12339.38s]  I want maybe Sherbert or Spud.
[12339.38s -> 12347.16s]  Or I think Sherbert gets, is it broom?
[12347.16s -> 12353.56s]  Sherbert's cool.
[12353.56s -> 12354.60s]  Yeah, well, sorry.
[12357.38s -> 12359.30s]  Oh, I have mud as a stored core.
[12363.61s -> 12369.40s]  Okay, let's clean up.
[12369.40s -> 12372.79s]  Ra's getting old.
[12372.79s -> 12374.63s]  Oh, no, we got to breed another.
[12374.63s -> 12376.79s]  We got to have Ra come out and breed.
[12376.79s -> 12389.72s]  Okay, we might make sure they're happy.
[12389.72s -> 12392.63s]  How are you doing over here, Tuba?
[12392.63s -> 12396.06s]  Do you want to have chicken nugget?
[12396.06s -> 12398.58s]  Okay, go play with something.
[12398.58s -> 12400.02s]  There's tons of toys everywhere.
[12400.58s -> 12406.52s]  Here, come here.
[12418.54s -> 12419.26s]  Play with this.
[12419.26s -> 12422.65s]  That's good.
[12422.65s -> 12423.69s]  Yeah, play with that.
[12423.69s -> 12427.50s]  I don't want to do that.
[12427.50s -> 12428.86s]  Okay, well, come here.
[12428.86s -> 12435.40s]  Clean up.
[12436.62s -> 12438.62s]  Do you understand I spent the last 20 minutes
[12438.62s -> 12441.02s]  just air frying whatever it is,
[12441.02s -> 12442.54s]  this stuff all over the ground.
[12442.54s -> 12443.98s]  It's back immediately.
[12444.06s -> 12456.74s]  The broom?
[12456.74s -> 12463.10s]  This will remove all physics objects from this room.
[12463.10s -> 12464.06s]  Food will be destroyed.
[12464.06s -> 12465.34s]  Eggs and seeds will be collected.
[12465.34s -> 12466.70s]  Toys and dog cores will be put away.
[12467.26s -> 12469.03s]  Unopened capsules will be lost.
[12469.59s -> 12471.80s]  Do I have any unopened capsules?
[12472.44s -> 12473.90s]  I got to check that first.
[12475.16s -> 12476.76s]  I don't want to do that to let me be certain of it.
[12477.48s -> 12483.91s]  I'm fine.
[12484.47s -> 12485.61s]  Let me just check.
[12486.17s -> 12492.55s]  Okay, clean.
[12492.55s -> 12496.79s]  Guys, that doesn't do anything.
[12497.72s -> 12500.12s]  There's still piss all over the ground in every room.
[12500.92s -> 12505.83s]  Oh, my God, you've been in the cocoon for so long.
[12505.83s -> 12517.26s]  Oh, geez.
[12517.34s -> 12519.67s]  Spud's gotten bigger.
[12519.67s -> 12524.89s]  10% back legs.
[12524.89s -> 12542.22s]  Too much like two, three percent across the board for body.
[12542.22s -> 12543.98s]  Do you spud and raw right now?
[12543.98s -> 12545.26s]  I will in just a second.
[12545.26s -> 12563.64s]  Okay, everything all right up here?
[12563.64s -> 12569.85s]  Smush.
[12569.85s -> 12570.97s]  Tube is not doing all right.
[12570.97s -> 12571.93s]  Tube, you need to go to bed.
[12574.12s -> 12578.52s]  Oh, what's wrong?
[12578.52s -> 12579.48s]  What, did he just puke?
[12580.54s -> 12581.18s]  Oh, no.
[12582.14s -> 12582.86s]  It's okay.
[12582.86s -> 12590.50s]  Are they sick?
[12590.50s -> 12591.86s]  Oh, courage is going to do it.
[12591.86s -> 12597.51s]  Come on.
[12597.51s -> 12599.83s]  Yes, very good.
[12599.83s -> 12628.30s]  Very, very good.
[12628.30s -> 12629.82s]  Jesus Christ.
[12629.82s -> 12646.62s]  Are we finally fucking clean?
[12646.62s -> 12653.58s]  All right, we're good.
[12655.22s -> 12660.65s]  John, go eat a honeycomb.
[12660.65s -> 12661.15s]  No.
[12662.89s -> 12666.90s]  Okay, we need to breed before it's too late.
[12666.90s -> 12673.37s]  I got another room.
[12673.37s -> 12677.56s]  I don't have any eggs.
[12677.56s -> 12682.18s]  I'm out of eggs.
[12682.18s -> 12683.06s]  What do you want for food?
[12683.06s -> 12687.64s]  You want a gourd?
[12687.64s -> 12688.57s]  Give it a try.
[12689.21s -> 12692.33s]  But how are you doing?
[12692.33s -> 12693.88s]  You don't look so good.
[12693.88s -> 12694.92s]  You're kind of struggling over here.
[12696.66s -> 12700.39s]  Uh-oh.
[12700.39s -> 12702.63s]  Wait, I wasn't ready to say goodbye.
[12702.63s -> 12705.77s]  I wasn't ready to say goodbye.
[12705.77s -> 12742.26s]  Oh, courage coming downstairs.
[12742.26s -> 12744.58s]  No, don't let John Deere eat that first.
[12744.58s -> 12760.02s]  Go eat the eraser.
[12760.02s -> 12760.74s]  You don't want it?
[12760.82s -> 12794.58s]  Don't eat that.
[12794.58s -> 12799.61s]  I'm trying just to get it out of here.
[12799.61s -> 12804.81s]  Get it out.
[12804.81s -> 12807.34s]  How come I can't take this out of here?
[12807.34s -> 12819.80s]  How to expel?
[12819.80s -> 12824.41s]  Oh, okay.
[12824.41s -> 12825.77s]  All right, we're going to have the memorial be...
[12826.65s -> 12829.53s]  We're going to have a different room.
[12829.53s -> 12830.57s]  Okay, different room.
[12830.57s -> 12833.03s]  This is going to be the memorial is going to be over here.
[12833.03s -> 12853.08s]  Is it going to be like a somber area?
[12853.08s -> 12857.27s]  This is the memorial.
[12857.27s -> 12871.18s]  Not like a comfy dog chair or something, right?
[12871.18s -> 12875.58s]  And I don't know.
[12875.58s -> 12882.76s]  Maybe like something.
[12882.76s -> 12885.83s]  What would a dog, what would like a dog?
[12885.83s -> 12887.27s]  No, this is, I don't like this.
[12887.27s -> 12891.72s]  Not mud.
[12891.72s -> 12893.24s]  No, something comfy.
[12893.24s -> 12894.86s]  I'm comfortable.
[12894.86s -> 12898.87s]  That's kind of comfy.
[12898.87s -> 12903.26s]  This is comfy.
[12903.26s -> 12905.88s]  Put a tree in there.
[12905.88s -> 12907.16s]  Yeah, I'll put a tree in here.
[12907.16s -> 12913.35s]  I'll put, yeah, this tree is going to go up here.
[12913.35s -> 12937.66s]  All right, now we need to move the memorials here.
[12937.66s -> 12940.71s]  There's one up here.
[12940.71s -> 12944.60s]  How do I take this with me?
[12944.60s -> 12950.65s]  I like, how do I move this to the other room?
[12950.65s -> 12958.26s]  I just remove the core.
[12958.26s -> 12959.14s]  How do I store it?
[12959.14s -> 12961.16s]  Remove core?
[12969.45s -> 12970.33s]  Put away.
[12970.33s -> 12985.83s]  Okay, so now, so now we're going to...
[12985.83s -> 12987.90s]  Oh, they all need to mutate.
[12987.90s -> 12989.66s]  All right, I'll be with you in one moment.
[12989.66s -> 12996.76s]  Hold on everybody.
[12996.76s -> 12997.64s]  Oh my God.
[12998.95s -> 13000.47s]  Okay, where is this thing?
[13000.47s -> 13005.70s]  Gravity machine?
[13005.70s -> 13009.21s]  Okay, so now where the hell is this here?
[13009.21s -> 13011.66s]  Stored cores.
[13011.66s -> 13025.86s]  Bring out.
[13025.86s -> 13027.54s]  I got to increase my like mouse sensitivity.
[13027.54s -> 13028.58s]  This is like horrible.
[13028.58s -> 13033.69s]  How do I do that?
[13033.69s -> 13051.42s]  Am I not?
[13051.42s -> 13052.38s]  One DPI.
[13052.38s -> 13056.23s]  I know, I'm like fucking move up and down.
[13056.23s -> 13060.79s]  Okay, so this is not bad.
[13060.79s -> 13073.21s]  I want to make them a little bigger though.
[13073.21s -> 13074.89s]  No one's going to be bigger than anyone else.
[13074.89s -> 13083.06s]  Actually, you got to be a little bit bigger.
[13083.06s -> 13088.90s]  This was mud.
[13088.90s -> 13090.98s]  Mud was a good dog, was one of the first dogs.
[13090.98s -> 13093.82s]  And this was raw.
[13093.82s -> 13100.98s]  Always made us laugh.
[13100.98s -> 13127.51s]  Let's get some mutations going.
[13127.51s -> 13128.63s]  Feed your dogs.
[13128.63s -> 13134.23s]  Come on, toad, whatever your name is.
[13134.23s -> 13134.87s]  Hurry up.
[13134.87s -> 13141.00s]  Oh, an egg.
[13141.00s -> 13144.15s]  Okay, you come out here because you need to eat.
[13153.43s -> 13154.07s]  All right, spud.
[13154.71s -> 13161.42s]  Let's give you some cheese.
[13161.42s -> 13163.18s]  And then I want you to...
[13163.18s -> 13172.36s]  Well, let's just rub your belly first.
[13172.36s -> 13173.24s]  Who was about to die?
[13173.24s -> 13174.20s]  Somebody was, right?
[13174.20s -> 13180.04s]  Some cheese.
[13180.04s -> 13184.79s]  Revive the dead dogs.
[13184.79s -> 13186.95s]  I think you can use their cores.
[13186.95s -> 13190.81s]  Spud, how can I help you here?
[13196.23s -> 13198.31s]  Turn, rotate.
[13198.31s -> 13200.98s]  How do I rotate them?
[13200.98s -> 13202.10s]  Okay, here we go.
[13202.10s -> 13204.04s]  Here, eat.
[13204.04s -> 13208.50s]  Have a burrito too.
[13208.50s -> 13210.15s]  It's way more filling and you're huge.
[13211.21s -> 13220.47s]  Eat it.
[13220.47s -> 13221.19s]  Way more filling.
[13221.19s -> 13221.67s]  That's good.
[13221.67s -> 13222.71s]  Okay, you're good.
[13222.71s -> 13225.61s]  Let's see what we get.
[13225.61s -> 13233.94s]  Color change.
[13233.94s -> 13235.78s]  Okay, smush is now an adult.
[13235.78s -> 13240.94s]  Smaller ears.
[13240.94s -> 13246.34s]  Piss everywhere.
[13246.34s -> 13256.36s]  I got to be more on top of this.
[13256.36s -> 13266.62s]  Piss and shit everywhere.
[13266.62s -> 13269.72s]  Ooh, new coat.
[13272.90s -> 13279.08s]  A little lighter.
[13279.08s -> 13281.37s]  Oh no, snout reduced.
[13281.37s -> 13282.66s]  That's not what we want.
[13282.66s -> 13286.65s]  A little glossier.
[13289.26s -> 13290.54s]  I want to give courage to wings.
[13290.54s -> 13305.35s]  What's the food that gives wings?
[13305.35s -> 13307.21s]  I'm a red bull.
[13310.94s -> 13313.56s]  What gives wings?
[13313.56s -> 13318.60s]  Wings gut bacteria is the yellow one.
[13318.60s -> 13319.56s]  Tiny wings.
[13319.56s -> 13322.38s]  Okay, this is from onion rings, gourds, and...
[13322.38s -> 13323.74s]  Okay, let's see if we can get it from here.
[13323.74s -> 13346.49s]  We need a guava over here.
[13346.49s -> 13351.98s]  We want you to grow some wings.
[13352.06s -> 13361.78s]  There you go.
[13361.78s -> 13363.56s]  The yellow one, right?
[13363.56s -> 13377.54s]  All right, now you can go sleep.
[13377.54s -> 13378.74s]  Eat good, courage.
[13378.74s -> 13385.46s]  Not much change for John.
[13385.46s -> 13388.34s]  A lot glossier.
[13388.34s -> 13390.47s]  Interesting.
[13390.47s -> 13397.02s]  Isn't this just bug snacks?
[13399.56s -> 13400.84s]  It's a little different, I think.
[13400.84s -> 13409.34s]  Tube is still shrinking.
[13409.34s -> 13412.79s]  Even smaller.
[13412.79s -> 13414.23s]  Look at how cute Tube is.
[13414.23s -> 13415.70s]  Tube is so cute.
[13415.70s -> 13417.61s]  I got to pee again.
[13417.61s -> 13418.17s]  God damn it.
[13418.17s -> 13418.97s]  All right, I'll be right back.
[13420.01s -> 13421.29s]  No more BRBs after this.
[13421.29s -> 13431.88s]  How do I pause the game?
[13431.88s -> 13440.30s]  Can you pause?
[13440.30s -> 13441.02s]  There's no pause?
[13442.73s -> 13443.61s]  Well, then here.
[13443.61s -> 13444.01s]  Just watch.
[13444.57s -> 13445.53s]  You guys can just watch.
[13445.53s -> 13447.64s]  I'll be right back.
[13447.64s -> 13559.29s]  What did I miss?
[13560.57s -> 13561.69s]  Nothing bad happened while I was gone?
[13564.25s -> 13566.09s]  Oh, also, now that there's a lot of people here.
[13568.63s -> 13572.01s]  July 14th is the baseball stream.
[13572.01s -> 13574.60s]  If you want to see that stream,
[13574.60s -> 13575.48s]  mark it on your calendar.
[13576.41s -> 13577.21s]  Baseball.
[13577.21s -> 13580.01s]  The Germa Baseball Association will commence.
[13580.01s -> 13581.56s]  Start and end.
[13581.56s -> 13583.77s]  Begin on July 14th.
[13585.75s -> 13586.63s]  Mark it.
[13586.63s -> 13592.47s]  Okay, you're tired.
[13594.70s -> 13596.70s]  I have access to an egg.
[13596.70s -> 13604.02s]  What do I want to do here?
[13604.02s -> 13606.46s]  I think I want to wait till...
[13606.46s -> 13609.21s]  Okay, once Tube is old enough.
[13609.21s -> 13611.19s]  Should I do spud and...
[13612.92s -> 13613.24s]  Where?
[13613.24s -> 13615.08s]  No, spud and smush?
[13615.08s -> 13620.26s]  I don't know.
[13620.26s -> 13621.94s]  Yeah, wait till Courage is old enough.
[13621.94s -> 13625.00s]  Courage and John, I think would be good.
[13625.00s -> 13630.04s]  I'll wait.
[13630.04s -> 13631.30s]  I think I only have one egg.
[13631.86s -> 13633.14s]  Yeah, I have one egg.
[13633.14s -> 13636.66s]  All right, spud.
[13636.66s -> 13642.76s]  I'm gonna need you to chill out.
[13642.76s -> 13643.32s]  Go to sleep.
[13648.18s -> 13649.11s]  Get some sleep.
[13649.75s -> 13655.03s]  Okay, you're stressed out.
[13655.03s -> 13655.27s]  Why?
[13655.27s -> 13655.75s]  What's wrong?
[13656.31s -> 13658.63s]  What's wrong?
[13658.63s -> 13659.03s]  You're okay?
[13659.75s -> 13663.03s]  Why are you so stressed out?
[13663.59s -> 13673.66s]  All right, relax.
[13673.66s -> 13674.62s]  All right, wings.
[13674.62s -> 13676.46s]  I need to feed Courage more stuff.
[13681.02s -> 13682.46s]  Courage, I want wings, which is...
[13682.46s -> 13683.58s]  Okay, Courage, come under.
[13684.38s -> 13691.75s]  Come over here, Courage.
[13695.16s -> 13695.80s]  Get over here.
[13697.69s -> 13700.14s]  Spud, please move out of the way.
[13700.14s -> 13701.18s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[13701.18s -> 13701.82s]  Put that down.
[13701.82s -> 13703.10s]  You need to eat because you need to get wings.
[13703.10s -> 13703.98s]  I want you to grow wings.
[13704.54s -> 13706.39s]  There you go.
[13706.39s -> 13716.41s]  Good dog.
[13716.41s -> 13717.93s]  Okay, now you can do whatever you want.
[13717.93s -> 13724.46s]  I don't know how you can be so dumb.
[13724.46s -> 13730.44s]  Oh, an egg.
[13730.44s -> 13736.82s]  He's trying to eat the food, but he...
[13736.82s -> 13738.26s]  You're on the wrong side, man.
[13738.90s -> 13742.36s]  All right, everyone's doing okay.
[13748.86s -> 13750.54s]  One more mutation and we'll be able to do it again.
[13760.74s -> 13763.83s]  Here, have some honey.
[13763.83s -> 13767.37s]  Have some honey.
[13767.37s -> 13768.25s]  There you go.
[13768.25s -> 13769.05s]  There you go.
[13769.05s -> 13770.65s]  That's a good dog.
[13770.65s -> 13771.93s]  There you go.
[13771.93s -> 13776.18s]  Go to sleep if you need to.
[13776.18s -> 13785.53s]  MonkaS.
[13785.53s -> 13789.10s]  Okay, everyone seems to be in good spirits.
[13789.10s -> 13789.50s]  Spud?
[13789.50s -> 13791.10s]  I don't know what's wrong with Spud.
[13791.10s -> 13792.33s]  I really don't.
[13792.33s -> 13793.21s]  He's not doing great.
[13794.09s -> 13799.88s]  He can't like walk around to get food.
[13799.88s -> 13803.11s]  You need to get some sleep.
[13803.11s -> 13805.06s]  It's so quiet up here.
[13805.06s -> 13806.50s]  Just go relax in the corner.
[13806.50s -> 13807.64s]  What could he say?
[13807.64s -> 13809.00s]  He has some trouble moving.
[13809.00s -> 13809.24s]  Why?
[13809.96s -> 13812.26s]  Come on, you can eat it.
[13818.70s -> 13819.74s]  Now go...
[13819.74s -> 13829.10s]  Okay, good.
[13829.10s -> 13829.98s]  I want you to be healthy.
[13830.86s -> 13831.98s]  Not all screwed up.
[13832.62s -> 13837.42s]  Okay.
[13837.42s -> 13843.18s]  Everybody seems to be fine.
[13845.66s -> 13846.06s]  Easy.
[13846.78s -> 13850.50s]  Herd, you want some more guava?
[13851.91s -> 13852.71s]  Eat it.
[13852.71s -> 13856.15s]  Yeah, because I'm trying to get the wings.
[13863.64s -> 13864.52s]  Very good.
[13864.52s -> 13871.50s]  The man just needed a ham slider.
[13871.50s -> 13875.69s]  All right, you're awake.
[13875.69s -> 13876.49s]  Eat another one of those.
[13876.49s -> 13876.73s]  I don't know.
[13876.73s -> 13878.17s]  I figured out this does something weird.
[13884.10s -> 13885.54s]  Eat another ham slider.
[13885.54s -> 13887.22s]  Train them to do stuff?
[13892.54s -> 13893.82s]  That was a papaya?
[13893.82s -> 13896.54s]  That's all right.
[13896.54s -> 13898.14s]  I don't know if I want to breed Spud.
[13899.10s -> 13900.86s]  Spud can't really walk.
[13900.86s -> 13907.10s]  Spud's a really good dog, but he can't really walk around.
[13910.50s -> 13911.78s]  He's a lot of trouble moving around.
[13911.78s -> 13912.90s]  I don't know why.
[13912.90s -> 13914.50s]  His body seems to be proportionally fine.
[13915.14s -> 13916.58s]  His body's like perfectly fine.
[13919.13s -> 13920.33s]  Maybe they're too far forward?
[13923.62s -> 13924.58s]  He's having a lot of trouble.
[13936.01s -> 13936.65s]  All right, smush.
[13936.65s -> 13937.37s]  Eat something.
[13937.37s -> 13945.00s]  Have some.
[13946.97s -> 13947.61s]  Go to bed.
[13948.34s -> 13948.90s]  Go to bed.
[13958.68s -> 13960.36s]  Here, eat banana.
[13960.36s -> 13964.31s]  Go to bed.
[13964.31s -> 13966.38s]  Go to bed.
[13977.93s -> 13978.73s]  No, what are you doing?
[13980.87s -> 13981.35s]  What are you doing?
[13981.91s -> 13983.21s]  What are you doing?
[13983.21s -> 13983.93s]  Stop it.
[13983.93s -> 13985.86s]  Oh, we're doing my Wellington.
[13985.86s -> 13990.52s]  Stop.
[13990.52s -> 13991.40s]  All right, but wait, wait, wait.
[13991.40s -> 13992.04s]  Here we go, here we go.
[13994.65s -> 13995.77s]  One more guava.
[13995.77s -> 13999.42s]  Let's see if we get wings.
[13999.42s -> 14001.38s]  I thought you retired that.
[14004.23s -> 14008.30s]  Holy shit.
[14008.30s -> 14010.30s]  I, wow, okay.
[14010.30s -> 14012.46s]  That would have been a fucking disaster.
[14012.46s -> 14016.38s]  That would have gotten all,
[14016.38s -> 14017.42s]  that would have dropped everywhere.
[14017.42s -> 14018.62s]  It would have gotten all over me.
[14018.62s -> 14026.95s]  All right, come on, wings.
[14026.95s -> 14028.31s]  I thought you retired that.
[14028.87s -> 14048.65s]  Pray for wings.
[14048.65s -> 14056.79s]  Wings, come on.
[14056.79s -> 14060.22s]  Yes, no.
[14060.22s -> 14061.34s]  All right, kind of cool though.
[14061.34s -> 14070.06s]  Looks really cool.
[14070.06s -> 14077.43s]  Probably the best looking dog we've had so far.
[14077.43s -> 14084.25s]  All right, now it's time to do some breeding.
[14084.25s -> 14085.05s]  And I'm going to sneeze.
[14090.98s -> 14119.29s]  I'm realizing how fucked up that was.
[14119.29s -> 14121.21s]  Why does tuba take the longest to do this?
[14121.21s -> 14129.74s]  How come I look purple?
[14129.74s -> 14131.66s]  I don't, dude, I don't know.
[14131.66s -> 14135.38s]  I don't, I have no idea why I look purple.
[14135.38s -> 14136.66s]  Your guess is as good as mine.
[14136.66s -> 14140.10s]  Are you kidding me?
[14140.10s -> 14141.22s]  There's a slide now.
[14141.22s -> 14154.28s]  Still shrinking.
[14154.28s -> 14157.77s]  Still shrinking by about 5% every time.
[14159.40s -> 14162.74s]  Okay, let's see what we get here.
[14162.74s -> 14180.06s]  This isn't breeding.
[14180.06s -> 14182.46s]  Lost a lot of leg gloss, which is weird.
[14182.46s -> 14185.54s]  All right, should I put the slide down?
[14185.54s -> 14187.30s]  All right, dude, what are you doing?
[14187.30s -> 14188.02s]  Relax.
[14188.02s -> 14191.10s]  Okay, let's breed.
[14191.10s -> 14192.28s]  Let's do it.
[14193.48s -> 14196.82s]  This is where it gets, it's going to be weird here.
[14196.82s -> 14207.34s]  Courage and tuba or should we do spud or John?
[14207.34s -> 14211.29s]  What would make the most interesting combination here?
[14211.29s -> 14222.31s]  All right, let's see if we get something crazy.
[14222.31s -> 14229.56s]  Interesting.
[14229.56s -> 14234.15s]  I'm thinking I like this one the most.
[14234.15s -> 14240.63s]  Look at this tiny little head and tiny little nose.
[14240.63s -> 14251.02s]  Yeah, wow.
[14251.02s -> 14253.26s]  All right, I love this one.
[14253.26s -> 14256.90s]  I can't say I love this one too.
[14256.90s -> 14264.79s]  Okay, I like these two.
[14264.79s -> 14268.62s]  Huge tail on this one and this one.
[14268.62s -> 14281.10s]  Another massive tail and this one here.
[14281.10s -> 14287.05s]  The tail just keeps getting longer.
[14287.05s -> 14288.57s]  I wonder if I should just take this one.
[14288.57s -> 14300.38s]  Oh god.
[14300.38s -> 14302.54s]  All right, we're at 89% stability.
[14302.54s -> 14315.58s]  Purple but doesn't have a huge tail.
[14315.58s -> 14322.04s]  This one has a massive tail and the purple one.
[14322.04s -> 14338.74s]  Maybe we get something in between.
[14338.74s -> 14339.88s]  There we go.
[14339.88s -> 14341.08s]  Rocko from Rocko's Modern Life.
[14345.03s -> 14346.31s]  I think I stay on this one.
[14346.31s -> 14351.45s]  Oh look, this one's got a Rudolph nose.
[14352.09s -> 14361.96s]  Do I dare try it one more time or should I combine Rudolph and Rocko?
[14361.96s -> 14379.74s]  Oh jeez, okay.
[14380.38s -> 14388.20s]  Again, do it again.
[14392.98s -> 14396.02s]  All right, the pool is getting a lot smaller.
[14396.02s -> 14398.36s]  Stop saying oh jeez.
[14398.36s -> 14399.24s]  Oh jeez.
[14399.24s -> 14400.68s]  Am I saying oh jeez a lot today?
[14400.68s -> 14401.32s]  Am I?
[14401.32s -> 14403.16s]  Am I saying oh jeez?
[14403.96s -> 14404.84s]  No, I'm not.
[14404.84s -> 14417.10s]  I don't know.
[14417.10s -> 14417.66s]  I'm not sure.
[14418.54s -> 14420.14s]  I think it's this one right here.
[14420.14s -> 14434.55s]  I like the red though.
[14435.19s -> 14441.80s]  I think this is best of both worlds here.
[14443.24s -> 14444.60s]  Yeah, this is the one.
[14453.82s -> 14455.42s]  That's best of both worlds.
[14455.42s -> 14468.02s]  All right, let's do it again.
[14468.02s -> 14471.72s]  This time we're going to do...
[14473.74s -> 14474.46s]  Who do we do now?
[14478.79s -> 14484.18s]  John Deere and Smush or John Deere and...
[14484.18s -> 14488.41s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[14488.41s -> 14489.37s]  John Deere and Curge.
[14489.37s -> 14496.14s]  What about Sherbert?
[14496.14s -> 14496.94s]  I feel like we're...
[14496.94s -> 14499.40s]  I think I like the blue.
[14499.40s -> 14505.46s]  Let's go for it.
[14505.46s -> 14507.58s]  What about Spud?
[14507.58s -> 14510.17s]  Where's Spud?
[14512.22s -> 14533.27s]  No, Spud is not doing so well.
[14533.27s -> 14533.99s]  Cool.
[14533.99s -> 14540.70s]  Maybe I wonder what...
[14540.70s -> 14541.26s]  Maybe we'll get a...
[14546.98s -> 14548.34s]  I think I don't want to do anything else.
[14548.34s -> 14549.46s]  This one looks like a squirrel.
[14549.46s -> 14550.26s]  I think I want the squirrel.
[14585.50s -> 14587.02s]  Oh, this one's fucking weird.
[14587.02s -> 14592.26s]  It's freaking me out.
[14592.26s -> 14593.30s]  Keep that one?
[14593.30s -> 14612.25s]  This one can't move.
[14614.87s -> 14616.71s]  Okay, so here comes...
[14616.71s -> 14619.96s]  How about as Rudolph?
[14619.96s -> 14632.90s]  Rutan is actually a pretty good name, yeah.
[14632.90s -> 14633.70s]  I like Rudolph.
[14641.99s -> 14643.03s]  All right, it's time to eat.
[14643.03s -> 14653.58s]  I still have another egg, don't I?
[14653.58s -> 14654.22s]  No, I don't.
[14654.22s -> 14654.78s]  Shit.
[14654.78s -> 14662.71s]  Why would you do this to animals?
[14662.71s -> 14664.98s]  Um, I don't know.
[14664.98s -> 14665.38s]  This is...
[14665.38s -> 14666.66s]  It's wobble dogs.
[14666.66s -> 14669.72s]  This is...
[14669.72s -> 14671.19s]  What do you mean?
[14671.83s -> 14672.87s]  Why did you do this?
[14675.72s -> 14677.96s]  Yeah, bro, it's a cartoon, all right?
[14677.96s -> 14679.08s]  It's a fucking cartoon.
[14680.90s -> 14682.18s]  All right, get rid of this.
[14682.18s -> 14684.41s]  Play with the ball.
[14689.59s -> 14691.43s]  Somebody just got sucked up.
[14693.51s -> 14695.59s]  Yo, bro, it's a cartoon, all right?
[14699.22s -> 14700.18s]  Anybody hungry?
[14700.18s -> 14703.72s]  All right, courage again.
[14703.72s -> 14705.86s]  I want you to eat these.
[14705.86s -> 14707.06s]  I want wings.
[14707.06s -> 14722.71s]  That's a bad defense.
[14722.71s -> 14736.26s]  They all have six legs.
[14736.82s -> 14737.22s]  I'm trying...
[14737.22s -> 14739.78s]  I want somebody with like nine or ten legs.
[14739.78s -> 14740.98s]  I want like a centipede.
[14740.98s -> 14743.29s]  What are you doing up here, Rudolph?
[14743.29s -> 14745.56s]  Paying your respects to the...
[14745.56s -> 14747.72s]  What a good boy.
[14747.72s -> 14750.34s]  Want to go sit in the chair?
[14750.34s -> 14754.20s]  You want to do some tricks?
[14754.20s -> 14757.59s]  Roll over.
[14757.59s -> 14758.95s]  Wow, so smart already.
[14760.23s -> 14761.51s]  Already so smart.
[14761.51s -> 14767.85s]  Do it again.
[14767.85s -> 14769.03s]  Speak.
[14769.03s -> 14771.62s]  Brilliant, dog.
[14771.62s -> 14776.57s]  Roll over.
[14776.57s -> 14781.93s]  Brilliant.
[14781.93s -> 14782.81s]  Good job.
[14782.81s -> 14787.59s]  Do it again.
[14787.59s -> 14792.79s]  You can do it.
[14793.67s -> 14794.47s]  Come on.
[14794.47s -> 14808.02s]  He's having a good time.
[14808.02s -> 14809.78s]  All right, I got a deviled egg.
[14809.78s -> 14818.95s]  Somebody eat a deviled egg.
[14818.95s -> 14829.29s]  What's happening over here?
[14829.29s -> 14832.14s]  Why do they have so much trouble getting food?
[14832.14s -> 14834.38s]  Here, have some deviled eggs, honey.
[14834.38s -> 14846.76s]  Why do they have so much trouble eating?
[14846.76s -> 14848.76s]  Like, what's going on?
[14848.76s -> 14849.32s]  Eat it.
[14849.32s -> 14856.14s]  Come on, eat the deviled egg.
[14856.14s -> 14866.81s]  Everybody have some deviled eggs.
[14866.81s -> 14869.30s]  Deviled eggs are fucking so gross.
[14870.55s -> 14874.74s]  But they're incredible when you want one.
[14874.74s -> 14882.38s]  Like, when you really, really want one,
[14882.38s -> 14886.74s]  it's like, holy shit, this is the greatest thing I've ever eaten my whole life.
[14886.74s -> 14888.82s]  Nine out of ten scenarios that the grossest fucking food
[14888.82s -> 14889.38s]  you could ever eat.
[14891.19s -> 14893.83s]  You need to eat a deviled egg right when it's made.
[14893.83s -> 14896.14s]  And not a second after that.
[14896.14s -> 14902.97s]  Not one second after.
[14902.97s -> 14907.96s]  If a deviled egg is even sitting out for five minutes,
[14907.96s -> 14909.16s]  I won't eat it.
[14909.16s -> 14909.66s]  I refuse.
[14918.58s -> 14921.45s]  Nope.
[14921.45s -> 14923.21s]  I feel the same way about hard-boiled eggs.
[14925.29s -> 14926.89s]  A fresh, hard-boiled egg,
[14929.29s -> 14930.89s]  you peel off the outer shell,
[14932.09s -> 14934.57s]  and it's just hot salt, pepper.
[14935.21s -> 14935.85s]  Eat it hot.
[14937.22s -> 14939.70s]  When you put hard-boiled eggs in the fridge in a container,
[14942.06s -> 14943.10s]  they stink.
[14945.72s -> 14947.56s]  All you hard-boiled egg lovers,
[14947.56s -> 14948.68s]  listen to me closely.
[14949.62s -> 14950.98s]  When you go to the fridge,
[14950.98s -> 14952.58s]  and you open up that container of hard-boiled eggs,
[14952.58s -> 14954.41s]  you take the container out,
[14954.41s -> 14957.08s]  everybody sits there and goes,
[14957.08s -> 14959.40s]  when I open this, it's going to be disgusting.
[14960.71s -> 14962.95s]  But one or two seconds after you take the lid off,
[14963.83s -> 14967.91s]  it stinks like fucking rotten eggs for ten seconds.
[14967.91s -> 14969.19s]  And then you go, okay, I'm fine.
[14971.34s -> 14973.34s]  It's like that every, it's just had that grow.
[14973.34s -> 14974.30s]  Oh my god, you're hungry.
[14974.86s -> 14979.56s]  What do you want?
[14979.56s -> 14980.44s]  What kind of food do you want?
[14980.84s -> 14988.36s]  A burrito, a hot deviled, no, no, no, no.
[14990.18s -> 14992.90s]  Deviled, if an egg is in a container for too long,
[14992.90s -> 14994.10s]  it smells awful.
[14995.38s -> 14996.18s]  Just eat them fresh.
[14997.40s -> 14998.60s]  When I used to lift all the time,
[14999.69s -> 15002.49s]  I would have like a dozen hard-boiled eggs in a container.
[15002.49s -> 15004.65s]  I don't know, I sound like a fucking old lady right now,
[15004.65s -> 15006.25s]  but bear with me, something's wrong with my throat.
[15007.86s -> 15013.34s]  When I was like 25, I would eat,
[15013.34s -> 15014.38s]  I would have a hard-boiled,
[15014.38s -> 15016.30s]  I would have like three hard-boiled eggs a day, four.
[15017.88s -> 15019.80s]  And it kind of hated it.
[15019.80s -> 15021.88s]  It was just like, oh, this like kind of smells it.
[15022.95s -> 15025.83s]  Even when they, not even a day goes by, one day.
[15026.55s -> 15028.52s]  You all know what I'm talking about,
[15028.52s -> 15029.48s]  you just refuse to believe it.
[15031.62s -> 15032.66s]  Ooh, new food.
[15036.74s -> 15038.26s]  I paused One Piece for this.
[15038.90s -> 15047.51s]  What are you, what, you're watching One Piece
[15047.51s -> 15049.83s]  and me at the same time?
[15049.83s -> 15055.24s]  I like Rudolph, Rudolph hangs out up here
[15055.24s -> 15058.78s]  and like pays like his respects to the other dogs.
[15058.78s -> 15066.44s]  What are you doing?
[15066.44s -> 15066.92s]  Look at him.
[15074.58s -> 15077.34s]  Oh, now that's so cute.
[15084.84s -> 15087.96s]  I'm telling you that I saw at least a few truths in the chat.
[15089.53s -> 15091.21s]  When you put hard-boiled eggs in the fridge
[15091.21s -> 15094.25s]  and a day or two later you open the container, it stinks.
[15094.89s -> 15098.81s]  I can't wait for you to make hard-boiled eggs,
[15098.81s -> 15100.41s]  put it in the fridge and you're going to take out the container.
[15100.41s -> 15102.17s]  You're going to hear what I said in your head
[15102.17s -> 15103.13s]  and you're going to go like this
[15104.01s -> 15105.61s]  and one or two seconds is going to go by
[15105.61s -> 15108.41s]  and you're going to go, and piece of shit was right.
[15118.90s -> 15119.46s]  I'm so happy.
[15120.34s -> 15124.25s]  All right, eat these wings.
[15129.05s -> 15130.98s]  You are literally never right about anything.
[15133.67s -> 15136.84s]  You don't even know what you're talking about.
[15136.84s -> 15138.20s]  You don't even know what you're talking about.
[15145.54s -> 15147.94s]  He is never right.
[15149.58s -> 15150.70s]  I can do this today.
[15151.34s -> 15152.38s]  Listen to this.
[15152.38s -> 15154.46s]  Wow, I got a good one here today.
[15155.80s -> 15160.18s]  This is not taking very much effort at all for me to do this, by the way.
[15160.18s -> 15164.42s]  I am just barely gently slowly doing this and I'm not even trying.
[15167.50s -> 15169.42s]  Am I really going to be like this for the rest of my life?
[15175.00s -> 15176.44s]  TikTok uncle voice.
[15177.48s -> 15180.78s]  Give me something to say.
[15180.78s -> 15182.70s]  Give me something to say in the TikTok voice.
[15183.96s -> 15184.76s]  Give me something to say.
[15185.32s -> 15186.82s]  What should I say?
[15186.82s -> 15188.02s]  TikTok TTS.
[15194.65s -> 15196.09s]  It's the TikTok voice.
[15197.45s -> 15199.13s]  It's not taking very much to do that.
[15204.26s -> 15205.70s]  Say it's the globalists.
[15205.70s -> 15210.65s]  No, the globalists.
[15210.65s -> 15211.61s]  TikTok voice.
[15212.17s -> 15213.13s]  I fucking can't.
[15215.94s -> 15217.38s]  Just got back from Coachella.
[15217.94s -> 15219.46s]  Had an insanely good time.
[15222.31s -> 15223.67s]  Here's some pics from the event.
[15224.23s -> 15230.50s]  Oh, look at all these toys.
[15235.34s -> 15236.78s]  Just got back from Coachella.
[15237.34s -> 15243.19s]  It was absolutely busting.
[15243.19s -> 15250.87s]  Ooh, you're doing the TikTok of Rocket voice.
[15250.87s -> 15258.52s]  I don't know what's going on with my throat.
[15258.52s -> 15259.64s]  I seriously have no idea.
[15266.07s -> 15268.95s]  Oh, it's time to mutate.
[15268.95s -> 15276.41s]  I was going to scream, but I was like, I don't want to hurt my voice.
[15276.41s -> 15285.30s]  That's actually the worst joke.
[15285.30s -> 15287.62s]  I don't know.
[15287.62s -> 15290.49s]  He's dancing to the music.
[15290.49s -> 15292.95s]  Yeah, I went like this and I was going to scream and I said,
[15292.95s -> 15294.55s]  I kind of braced my eyes for the scream.
[15294.55s -> 15296.23s]  But then I was like, mutate.
[15296.23s -> 15299.46s]  Nah, I gave up.
[15299.46s -> 15300.50s]  Didn't want to do that.
[15300.50s -> 15303.06s]  Didn't want to scream really loud into the mic.
[15303.06s -> 15314.06s]  Do Voldemort noises.
[15318.98s -> 15319.38s]  What are we going to get?
[15319.38s -> 15320.02s]  Come on, Rudolph.
[15320.02s -> 15320.66s]  Give us something cool.
[15321.22s -> 15335.88s]  The reds got redder.
[15335.88s -> 15337.64s]  The brights got brighter.
[15337.64s -> 15344.71s]  Got bigger legs.
[15344.71s -> 15346.07s]  No, the tail went down.
[15346.07s -> 15363.40s]  It's all right.
[15363.40s -> 15365.16s]  I love how they rock out to this music.
[15365.16s -> 15366.04s]  It's so cool.
[15366.04s -> 15367.35s]  It's so funny.
[15367.35s -> 15372.10s]  They're just having so much fun.
[15375.21s -> 15375.69s]  Good job.
[15376.25s -> 15377.69s]  That was very good dancing.
[15377.69s -> 15386.55s]  Very, very good.
[15386.55s -> 15387.35s]  Very good job.
[15387.35s -> 15389.67s]  Except you peed your pants.
[15389.67s -> 15390.89s]  What is it?
[15390.89s -> 15391.77s]  What is it, boy?
[15391.77s -> 15400.68s]  What is it?
[15400.68s -> 15401.40s]  Good job.
[15401.40s -> 15407.13s]  All right.
[15407.13s -> 15408.17s]  Stop shaking around so much.
[15408.17s -> 15411.18s]  I can't see.
[15411.18s -> 15412.14s]  New creature egg.
[15415.14s -> 15417.35s]  Somebody's hungry.
[15417.75s -> 15419.27s]  I forgot Tuba was still alive.
[15419.27s -> 15420.23s]  I thought Tuba was dead.
[15420.79s -> 15428.18s]  Okay.
[15428.18s -> 15428.50s]  Let's see.
[15428.50s -> 15428.98s]  What do we get?
[15430.95s -> 15438.09s]  How about Spud and Courage?
[15438.09s -> 15438.57s]  No.
[15438.57s -> 15440.41s]  We have too much courage.
[15440.41s -> 15441.77s]  We're going to end up having Courage B
[15442.41s -> 15445.96s]  in every single piece of lineage, right?
[15445.96s -> 15447.08s]  Tuba and Spud.
[15447.08s -> 15455.54s]  Let's go.
[15455.54s -> 15456.26s]  Ooh.
[15456.26s -> 15463.88s]  I like this one and this one.
[15463.88s -> 15464.52s]  Mutate them.
[15465.08s -> 15469.90s]  That looks like a cat.
[15469.90s -> 15482.15s]  Let's take this to zero.
[15482.15s -> 15486.97s]  Let's take it to zero.
[15504.34s -> 15504.98s]  Ooh.
[15504.98s -> 15508.98s]  We've got a mutation.
[15508.98s -> 15516.09s]  Another mutation.
[15516.09s -> 15529.16s]  Another mutation.
[15529.16s -> 15535.77s]  Oh, yeah.
[15535.77s -> 15537.08s]  Perfect.
[15537.08s -> 15539.14s]  Looks good.
[15539.14s -> 15540.02s]  Let's do it again.
[15540.02s -> 15556.23s]  Oh, the pool is kind of shrinking a little.
[15556.23s -> 15558.10s]  It's kind of like Snoopy.
[15558.10s -> 15567.96s]  I think this is it.
[15570.57s -> 15571.61s]  I think it's this one right here.
[15571.61s -> 15574.04s]  Snoopy.
[15574.04s -> 15575.16s]  Worst joke 2022.
[15575.16s -> 15592.49s]  Jerma says Bussin'.
[15592.49s -> 15593.21s]  Ooh.
[15593.21s -> 15593.53s]  All right.
[15593.53s -> 15593.93s]  I think we...
[15593.93s -> 15594.49s]  I don't know.
[15594.49s -> 15595.85s]  I think it's this one here in the middle.
[15595.85s -> 15598.50s]  This looks the healthiest.
[15598.50s -> 15599.14s]  That's the one.
[15599.14s -> 15608.22s]  Oh, I said Bussin'.
[15608.22s -> 15612.98s]  Were you here the other day when I said...
[15612.98s -> 15614.10s]  What did I say the other day?
[15614.10s -> 15616.15s]  I said something the other day.
[15616.15s -> 15616.87s]  What was it?
[15616.87s -> 15617.99s]  Oh, yeah.
[15617.99s -> 15619.11s]  I said like sheesh.
[15619.11s -> 15619.43s]  I said...
[15619.43s -> 15620.71s]  I was like, oh, sheesh.
[15620.71s -> 15637.14s]  Yeah, you're all right.
[15641.11s -> 15645.18s]  I am now not allowed to say those things.
[15645.18s -> 15645.98s]  When I say...
[15645.98s -> 15646.30s]  Okay.
[15646.30s -> 15648.14s]  If let's say the dog were to go like this.
[15648.78s -> 15649.26s]  Whoa.
[15649.26s -> 15650.62s]  That dog was Bussin'.
[15650.62s -> 15651.66s]  People would be like...
[15651.66s -> 15653.42s]  Shut up, you fucking old loser.
[15653.42s -> 15655.58s]  I'm at the age where like I can't do that now.
[15655.58s -> 15656.62s]  Because people yell at me.
[15657.99s -> 15659.19s]  People say that...
[15659.19s -> 15659.91s]  We don't say that.
[15660.47s -> 15666.49s]  If I were to say like Bussin' or like sheesh or like...
[15667.29s -> 15667.93s]  Oh, dude.
[15667.93s -> 15668.81s]  No cap, right?
[15668.81s -> 15672.76s]  People would be like, I fucking hate this guy, right?
[15678.50s -> 15679.46s]  Don't even tell me.
[15680.98s -> 15681.78s]  Don't even tell me.
[15683.02s -> 15683.98s]  If I were to...
[15683.98s -> 15684.54s]  Let's try it.
[15685.62s -> 15691.29s]  I want the mods to count the amount of like minus twos, ha-has.
[15692.17s -> 15694.20s]  I'm not going to tell you when I'm going to do it.
[15694.20s -> 15695.16s]  I want these mods...
[15695.72s -> 15696.12s]  Count it.
[15696.12s -> 15698.36s]  Count how many times people say something negative about it.
[15699.32s -> 15699.72s]  Just watch.
[15700.28s -> 15701.66s]  Let's check it out.
[15701.66s -> 15702.06s]  You'll see.
[15704.41s -> 15707.29s]  I'm going to use it in such a great context.
[15707.29s -> 15708.49s]  I'm just going to say it's going to be perfect.
[15710.34s -> 15711.54s]  Where's the egg machine?
[15714.12s -> 15714.76s]  Oh, my goodness.
[15714.76s -> 15715.64s]  I forgot about this guy.
[15716.28s -> 15718.50s]  How about like teeny?
[15719.14s -> 15720.86s]  Like teeny tiny?
[15720.86s -> 15721.42s]  How about like...
[15722.06s -> 15722.86s]  I like teeny...
[15722.86s -> 15723.18s]  Look what?
[15723.18s -> 15723.90s]  Like teeny?
[15726.09s -> 15727.45s]  I'm not even going to do it today either.
[15727.45s -> 15729.53s]  I'm going to hold on to this for like a few days at least.
[15730.17s -> 15736.86s]  Tipsy?
[15738.55s -> 15739.27s]  Tipsy's fine.
[15739.83s -> 15740.95s]  Oh, look at little Tipsy.
[15741.59s -> 15758.34s]  Go in the house, Tipsy.
[15758.98s -> 15764.46s]  Are you going to eat that or...
[15764.46s -> 15764.86s]  Okay, fine.
[15764.86s -> 15765.66s]  Eat it.
[15765.66s -> 15766.70s]  I want you to get wings.
[15766.70s -> 15767.58s]  That'd be cool.
[15767.58s -> 15772.74s]  Should have named him Grafted Scion.
[15772.74s -> 15775.22s]  That's pretty good.
[15775.78s -> 15777.24s]  All right.
[15777.24s -> 15777.72s]  People...
[15777.72s -> 15778.76s]  Who wants to have fun in here?
[15778.76s -> 15779.72s]  Somebody's not having fun.
[15780.79s -> 15782.31s]  John is not having a good time.
[15782.95s -> 15787.16s]  Why don't you play?
[15788.41s -> 15789.29s]  Yeah, like go play.
[15789.93s -> 15793.14s]  Oh, my God.
[15793.14s -> 15794.66s]  Spud is like suffering again.
[15795.30s -> 15796.98s]  Sweetheart, I'll have another devil egg.
[15797.54s -> 15812.20s]  Something healthier, please.
[15812.20s -> 15813.80s]  Like a nutrition pellet.
[15813.80s -> 15818.09s]  Is it me or is Spud always having a problem, right?
[15819.98s -> 15820.78s]  I wonder why.
[15820.78s -> 15823.74s]  Why is Spud just not ever having a good time?
[15823.74s -> 15824.24s]  Ever.
[15832.42s -> 15833.94s]  Spud doesn't like to go to sleep.
[15834.50s -> 15835.46s]  I think that's what's going on.
[15835.46s -> 15836.42s]  Spud doesn't like to go to bed.
[15840.41s -> 15844.82s]  I come up here and Spud is in red for his sleep every time.
[15845.54s -> 15865.32s]  I liked over at the mod chat that I have in my Discord.
[15866.28s -> 15867.56s]  And I see LOL.
[15867.56s -> 15868.84s]  We're not going to do that.
[15869.48s -> 15882.04s]  All right.
[15882.04s -> 15882.52s]  We don't have...
[15883.48s -> 15884.44s]  I refuse.
[15884.44s -> 15884.84s]  Okay.
[15884.84s -> 15885.16s]  All right.
[15885.16s -> 15886.04s]  We don't have to do that.
[15886.76s -> 15891.27s]  We don't have to do that.
[15891.27s -> 15893.83s]  Somebody said there were at least two when you said it.
[15893.83s -> 15894.31s]  Okay.
[15894.31s -> 15894.63s]  All right.
[15898.63s -> 15899.67s]  Thankfully, it's clean.
[15908.52s -> 15909.82s]  Look at...
[15909.82s -> 15911.02s]  Oh, can he not even eat?
[15915.34s -> 15919.56s]  This was your guy's idea.
[15919.56s -> 15920.68s]  I didn't want to do this.
[15920.68s -> 15922.71s]  This was your idea.
[15922.71s -> 15923.51s]  I didn't want to do this.
[15923.51s -> 15923.91s]  I'm sorry.
[15923.91s -> 15924.47s]  I didn't want to do this.
[15924.47s -> 15927.16s]  You did it.
[15927.16s -> 15928.84s]  I don't think he can even eat food.
[15928.84s -> 15930.15s]  Look what you did.
[15930.15s -> 15930.71s]  I didn't do this.
[15932.47s -> 15933.59s]  I wanted to do it another time.
[15945.34s -> 15946.78s]  Maybe I can feed?
[15946.78s -> 15947.50s]  Can I feed you?
[15947.50s -> 15950.04s]  Like, go on.
[15950.04s -> 15950.76s]  Eat it.
[15950.76s -> 15951.08s]  Okay.
[15952.47s -> 15952.71s]  All right.
[15952.71s -> 15953.11s]  No, no, no.
[15953.11s -> 15953.51s]  It was fine.
[15953.51s -> 15955.03s]  I think I just have to tell him to eat.
[15955.59s -> 15958.70s]  What are you doing over here?
[15958.70s -> 15959.18s]  Smush.
[15959.18s -> 15971.08s]  Leave him alone.
[15971.08s -> 15971.80s]  Oh, they're like...
[15971.80s -> 15973.40s]  He's bumping his nose.
[15973.40s -> 15990.23s]  I think he's trying to make a friend.
[15990.23s -> 15990.95s]  Give Tipsy.
[15992.95s -> 15994.15s]  Tipsy's fine.
[15994.15s -> 15999.16s]  That was very nice of you, Smush.
[15999.16s -> 16001.64s]  Tipsy is a baby and you were very gentle.
[16001.64s -> 16002.68s]  And so that was very good.
[16002.68s -> 16003.96s]  That was very kind of you.
[16003.96s -> 16008.95s]  How's everybody doing?
[16008.95s -> 16009.75s]  Tipsy's okay.
[16010.31s -> 16011.43s]  Tipsy, you should just go to sleep.
[16011.99s -> 16017.48s]  Spud?
[16017.48s -> 16018.04s]  Looking for food?
[16018.04s -> 16018.76s]  What do you need?
[16018.76s -> 16019.64s]  What do you need, bud?
[16019.64s -> 16025.05s]  Sitting over by here.
[16025.05s -> 16026.41s]  How about a dehydrated treat?
[16026.41s -> 16029.11s]  How you doing?
[16029.11s -> 16029.27s]  Okay.
[16029.27s -> 16029.91s]  Well, you have to get out of the way.
[16029.91s -> 16030.87s]  I can't press the button.
[16030.87s -> 16039.14s]  Oh, god damn it.
[16039.14s -> 16039.78s]  Whatever.
[16039.78s -> 16044.33s]  Oh, Spud's getting old.
[16044.33s -> 16044.73s]  Okay.
[16044.73s -> 16045.85s]  Spud's getting old?
[16045.85s -> 16052.71s]  Okay, have a snack.
[16052.71s -> 16056.33s]  What the hell was that?
[16057.64s -> 16057.88s]  Okay.
[16058.81s -> 16060.09s]  Tipsy is about to mutate.
[16060.09s -> 16061.29s]  But I want to feed Tipsy.
[16061.29s -> 16061.53s]  What's...
[16061.53s -> 16062.81s]  I need something that looks like leg strength.
[16064.74s -> 16067.03s]  What do I feed for leg strength?
[16067.03s -> 16082.46s]  What have you done to Tipsy?
[16082.46s -> 16083.26s]  I didn't do anything.
[16086.04s -> 16090.81s]  Turn on the gravity machine?
[16090.81s -> 16091.29s]  All right, Tipsy.
[16091.29s -> 16092.33s]  Let's just pupate.
[16092.33s -> 16093.45s]  We'll just get it over with.
[16093.45s -> 16106.52s]  This game sucks.
[16106.52s -> 16107.24s]  It's so sad.
[16108.41s -> 16109.13s]  What do you mean it's sad?
[16110.41s -> 16111.21s]  Look at this room.
[16111.21s -> 16112.33s]  Look at how these guys have been
[16112.33s -> 16113.45s]  having a ball up here the whole time.
[16116.94s -> 16118.42s]  Look.
[16118.42s -> 16119.14s]  Is this sad?
[16119.14s -> 16120.18s]  This is great.
[16120.74s -> 16121.62s]  They're having a good time.
[16121.62s -> 16122.50s]  They've been playing.
[16122.50s -> 16123.54s]  These lay love to play.
[16124.10s -> 16125.27s]  They're very polite.
[16125.83s -> 16130.15s]  I mean, he's a little rude, but it's okay.
[16130.15s -> 16130.95s]  Food-averse?
[16131.59s -> 16132.23s]  That's all right.
[16133.27s -> 16137.72s]  They've just been up here headbanging.
[16137.72s -> 16145.27s]  I'm definitely putting that up here.
[16145.91s -> 16150.14s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[16150.14s -> 16150.38s]  Yep.
[16151.18s -> 16151.82s]  That's good shit.
[16156.70s -> 16157.42s]  All right, Tipsy, come on.
[16157.42s -> 16158.46s]  You got to have stronger legs.
[16169.51s -> 16169.91s]  All right.
[16169.91s -> 16171.83s]  Front legs got a little thicker.
[16171.83s -> 16182.20s]  The body shrink and legs got longer.
[16182.92s -> 16189.78s]  But oh my God.
[16199.56s -> 16199.88s]  Okay.
[16204.25s -> 16205.53s]  I think somebody needs to eat Tipsy.
[16206.73s -> 16210.82s]  All right, you're good to go.
[16210.82s -> 16211.94s]  You've been rocking out this whole time.
[16211.94s -> 16213.46s]  How about a guava?
[16213.46s -> 16215.98s]  Here, have some food first.
[16215.98s -> 16218.62s]  I think Rudolph might be the best dog
[16218.62s -> 16219.82s]  we have besides courage.
[16222.02s -> 16223.46s]  We have to decide who's going to eat Tipsy.
[16226.06s -> 16227.18s]  That's the big issue here.
[16232.20s -> 16233.00s]  I really want wings.
[16233.00s -> 16234.44s]  All right, I'll try the gravity machine
[16234.44s -> 16235.88s]  in like the playroom or something like down here.
[16242.34s -> 16244.42s]  Dog stack, gravity machine.
[16245.14s -> 16246.26s]  Oh, this is the new food.
[16246.26s -> 16246.42s]  Right.
[16246.42s -> 16247.54s]  I wanted to see what was in here.
[16255.22s -> 16255.54s]  Moon.
[16267.67s -> 16268.95s]  Should I put this in a room with Tipsy
[16268.95s -> 16274.18s]  so Tipsy can like actually move?
[16274.18s -> 16274.66s]  Mars?
[16277.72s -> 16283.02s]  Oh, back to earth.
[16283.02s -> 16284.70s]  Oh, that looked like it hurt.
[16284.70s -> 16302.49s]  Get that fucking thing out of here.
[16302.49s -> 16303.45s]  All right, new food.
[16303.45s -> 16306.57s]  Pancakes, garlic bread, chips, lasagna.
[16306.57s -> 16307.53s]  All right, lasagna.
[16307.53s -> 16308.49s]  Who wants a lasagna?
[16308.49s -> 16311.06s]  This thing's got to move.
[16312.18s -> 16314.23s]  I need to hold on.
[16314.23s -> 16314.95s]  My shoulder hurts.
[16314.95s -> 16315.35s]  Okay.
[16315.35s -> 16334.95s]  All right, let's start serving up some pancakes and shit.
[16334.95s -> 16336.55s]  All right, look at these new DNA strands.
[16336.55s -> 16342.12s]  I'm just going to start throwing them down there.
[16342.12s -> 16343.22s]  They'll eat them eventually.
[16343.22s -> 16345.90s]  They'll figure it out.
[16345.90s -> 16347.50s]  Pancakes, garlic bread.
[16347.50s -> 16352.20s]  Food's coming.
[16352.20s -> 16360.07s]  Doritos or something.
[16360.07s -> 16370.86s]  A few lasagnas down there.
[16370.86s -> 16379.88s]  Wait.
[16379.88s -> 16390.44s]  Spud has lived a long life.
[16390.44s -> 16391.00s]  Oh, no.
[16391.00s -> 16393.08s]  Spud.
[16393.08s -> 16394.12s]  Oh, Spud.
[16394.12s -> 16395.32s]  Spud's dead.
[16395.32s -> 16398.14s]  Oh, no.
[16398.14s -> 16405.78s]  It's okay, Spud.
[16405.78s -> 16406.98s]  No, it's all right.
[16406.98s -> 16409.83s]  Where's courage?
[16409.83s -> 16411.74s]  Courage, you need to eat that.
[16411.74s -> 16418.38s]  Tipsy made it up here.
[16418.38s -> 16421.21s]  No, you don't touch that too, but get out of here.
[16421.21s -> 16421.85s]  No, smush.
[16421.85s -> 16422.81s]  Don't touch that.
[16423.21s -> 16429.54s]  What happened in there?
[16430.10s -> 16431.32s]  I need somebody.
[16431.32s -> 16431.88s]  I need...
[16431.88s -> 16432.76s]  Where's courage?
[16432.76s -> 16437.35s]  Courage, come on out.
[16437.35s -> 16440.04s]  End table.
[16440.04s -> 16440.92s]  Large tube.
[16440.92s -> 16449.16s]  It's a piece of tofu.
[16449.16s -> 16450.20s]  Don't eat poop.
[16450.20s -> 16454.33s]  Do I...
[16454.33s -> 16455.21s]  Oh, my God.
[16455.21s -> 16457.46s]  No, Rudolph should eat it.
[16457.46s -> 16458.10s]  Rudolph should eat it.
[16458.10s -> 16467.24s]  He's my favorite.
[16467.24s -> 16467.88s]  All right.
[16467.88s -> 16472.30s]  Your name being Rudolph doesn't really make any sense anymore.
[16472.30s -> 16473.75s]  That's okay, though.
[16473.75s -> 16482.94s]  Tuba, get the fuck out of here.
[16482.94s -> 16483.50s]  Tuba's not...
[16483.50s -> 16484.54s]  You're not supposed to be doing that.
[16484.54s -> 16485.90s]  Eat the pizza and garlic bread and stuff.
[16485.90s -> 16488.65s]  Whatever.
[16488.65s -> 16489.21s]  You eat that.
[16489.21s -> 16492.09s]  I swear to God.
[16492.09s -> 16493.21s]  Don't touch that.
[16493.21s -> 16497.27s]  Who do I want to eat the orb?
[16502.26s -> 16504.18s]  Do I want Rudolph or do I want courage?
[16504.18s -> 16519.77s]  Give it a tipsy.
[16519.77s -> 16521.05s]  No, I don't need a memorial.
[16521.05s -> 16525.85s]  I'm going to feed it to tipsy.
[16525.85s -> 16526.65s]  Why would I do that?
[16526.65s -> 16528.89s]  That's the fucking dumbest idea we've had all day.
[16528.89s -> 16537.02s]  I don't even know where tipsy is.
[16545.24s -> 16546.28s]  I'm not feeding.
[16547.70s -> 16548.18s]  Oh, no.
[16548.18s -> 16549.30s]  Smush is old.
[16549.30s -> 16584.70s]  We're going to get tipsy big and strong here.
[16592.26s -> 16596.86s]  I'm looking for leg strength.
[16596.86s -> 16597.42s]  Thick legs.
[16597.42s -> 16597.66s]  All right.
[16597.66s -> 16599.26s]  We need deviled eggs.
[16599.26s -> 16602.04s]  Oh, sweet.
[16602.04s -> 16602.60s]  It's so sweet.
[16602.60s -> 16613.38s]  I have some deviled eggs.
[16613.38s -> 16624.33s]  Long body.
[16624.33s -> 16626.17s]  And this increases growth, too.
[16626.17s -> 16627.13s]  This means big.
[16627.13s -> 16629.85s]  Can you eat that tooth, too?
[16629.85s -> 16639.10s]  I hope you'll eat it.
[16639.10s -> 16639.66s]  All right.
[16639.66s -> 16641.82s]  I'm ready for tipsy to do a little evolution here.
[16641.82s -> 16646.28s]  Get some sleep.
[16646.28s -> 16648.84s]  And we'll see if we can get you a little bit stronger.
[16648.84s -> 16655.05s]  Get out of here.
[16655.05s -> 16655.85s]  It's a menace.
[16655.85s -> 16663.22s]  That tube is a menace.
[16663.22s -> 16669.18s]  Kind of funny, but it causes problems a lot, I think.
[16669.98s -> 16675.56s]  You're fine up here.
[16675.56s -> 16675.80s]  All right.
[16675.80s -> 16676.52s]  Who else is there?
[16677.16s -> 16679.50s]  Don, you need to sleep.
[16679.50s -> 16684.54s]  Smush is...
[16685.34s -> 16686.38s]  Let me play with you for a second.
[16686.38s -> 16687.26s]  Come here.
[16687.26s -> 16699.80s]  I'm drying him off.
[16699.80s -> 16701.66s]  He's covered in water.
[16701.66s -> 16705.06s]  Don's getting old.
[16705.06s -> 16705.56s]  Uh-oh.
[16709.56s -> 16710.60s]  Oh, shit.
[16710.60s -> 16712.04s]  I completely forgot about Snoopy.
[16718.84s -> 16719.56s]  Charge is fine.
[16720.28s -> 16727.42s]  The positive reinforcement cap for any property.
[16727.42s -> 16729.50s]  Proto?
[16729.50s -> 16732.73s]  What is that?
[16733.53s -> 16735.67s]  Who's Proto?
[16745.75s -> 16746.55s]  Whoa.
[16746.55s -> 16748.62s]  I got spots.
[16749.34s -> 16752.52s]  Okay.
[16753.48s -> 16753.96s]  Interesting.
[16754.68s -> 16757.16s]  All right.
[16757.16s -> 16757.64s]  John, eat.
[16758.68s -> 16760.20s]  Eat like some lasagna or something.
[16760.20s -> 16761.00s]  Yeah, eat a lasagna.
[16761.72s -> 16766.15s]  There you go.
[16766.15s -> 16766.95s]  Good.
[16766.95s -> 16768.73s]  Eat a lasagna.
[16768.73s -> 16769.77s]  Eat like a pancake.
[16769.77s -> 16770.41s]  I just want...
[16770.41s -> 16771.37s]  I want you to mutate.
[16772.33s -> 16773.29s]  Aren't you going to die, though?
[16773.93s -> 16775.22s]  Who has not mutated?
[16775.22s -> 16775.70s]  Okay.
[16775.70s -> 16777.78s]  Actually, you come up here and eat like a pancake or something.
[16778.42s -> 16784.38s]  Adult?
[16785.94s -> 16786.26s]  Okay.
[16786.26s -> 16786.66s]  Tipsy.
[16787.22s -> 16794.62s]  I got you.
[16794.62s -> 16797.61s]  We're going to go feed you a bunch of pancakes and stuff.
[16797.61s -> 16810.50s]  Okay.
[16810.50s -> 16813.00s]  Tipsy, eat a pancake.
[16815.27s -> 16816.63s]  I want Tipsy to be social.
[16817.67s -> 16818.55s]  This is like not fair.
[16827.80s -> 16829.16s]  That was a violent sound.
[16829.80s -> 16830.68s]  Oh, stop.
[16831.24s -> 16832.44s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[16832.44s -> 16833.08s]  Come over here.
[16834.49s -> 16834.97s]  Pancake.
[16851.27s -> 16852.71s]  I'm busy trying to help.
[16852.71s -> 16855.58s]  That's not how you eat.
[16861.45s -> 16862.33s]  Oh, my goodness.
[16863.93s -> 16865.29s]  It's not time for you to cocoon yet.
[16865.29s -> 16866.17s]  You have to eat this.
[16876.73s -> 16879.37s]  Smush has lived a long life, but Smush is dead.
[16881.35s -> 16883.11s]  They're dropping like flies right now.
[16883.67s -> 16884.79s]  That's like three in a row.
[16885.35s -> 16926.28s]  Hi, Tuba.
[16926.28s -> 16940.95s]  Where are you going?
[16940.95s -> 16942.07s]  Give Smush to Tipsy.
[16942.07s -> 16952.15s]  That's the plan.
[16952.15s -> 16952.79s]  Eat it.
[16952.79s -> 16960.76s]  All right.
[16960.76s -> 16961.00s]  Come on.
[16961.00s -> 16961.56s]  What are you going to get?
[16962.74s -> 16969.46s]  How are you looking?
[16969.46s -> 16975.34s]  Okay.
[16975.34s -> 16976.86s]  Color change.
[16978.74s -> 16980.02s]  Legs have grown.
[16980.02s -> 16983.59s]  Tail has grown.
[16983.59s -> 16996.60s]  Body size has gone down and body length has gone down again.
[16996.60s -> 16997.40s]  It's all right.
[16997.40s -> 17001.08s]  Okay.
[17001.08s -> 17001.40s]  I need to...
[17001.40s -> 17006.41s]  Where is concrete floor?
[17006.41s -> 17007.13s]  I don't know.
[17007.13s -> 17013.88s]  What's wrong with you?
[17013.88s -> 17015.80s]  Why is he so...
[17015.80s -> 17016.60s]  Why is he huffing and puffing?
[17016.60s -> 17017.56s]  Why is he so pissed off?
[17017.56s -> 17019.75s]  What's wrong?
[17019.75s -> 17022.39s]  It's okay.
[17022.39s -> 17023.27s]  Calm down.
[17023.27s -> 17024.44s]  It's okay.
[17024.44s -> 17028.33s]  Everything's fine.
[17028.33s -> 17037.85s]  You guys want to play?
[17037.85s -> 17042.14s]  Oh, shit.
[17042.14s -> 17042.94s]  He's like, uh-oh.
[17043.99s -> 17044.71s]  Oh, fuck.
[17053.70s -> 17057.16s]  Tipsy is going to be the only one left.
[17057.16s -> 17057.40s]  All right.
[17057.40s -> 17060.60s]  Tipsy, you got to go eat.
[17060.60s -> 17060.92s]  All right.
[17060.92s -> 17061.80s]  Tipsy, get out.
[17061.80s -> 17063.54s]  Follow me.
[17063.54s -> 17069.86s]  Dude, Tuba is the first person to come and eat every single person.
[17069.86s -> 17070.82s]  Do you notice that?
[17070.82s -> 17086.44s]  I don't touch that, Tuba.
[17090.90s -> 17091.70s]  Tipsy, eat that.
[17102.97s -> 17104.41s]  Lifespan extended.
[17104.41s -> 17107.74s]  Okay.
[17107.74s -> 17109.94s]  I want...
[17109.94s -> 17111.14s]  Where's the other one?
[17111.14s -> 17111.78s]  Somebody else died.
[17111.78s -> 17112.26s]  Where are they?
[17114.23s -> 17115.56s]  Somebody...
[17115.56s -> 17116.28s]  Who else died?
[17116.28s -> 17117.08s]  They're on the ground somewhere.
[17117.08s -> 17118.12s]  They're like a box.
[17118.12s -> 17122.04s]  Eat that pizza.
[17122.04s -> 17128.97s]  Eat a pancake?
[17128.97s -> 17129.93s]  No, eat a chip.
[17129.93s -> 17137.93s]  You're so hungry.
[17137.93s -> 17138.17s]  All right.
[17138.17s -> 17138.73s]  Hold on.
[17138.73s -> 17141.96s]  Okay.
[17141.96s -> 17142.84s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[17142.84s -> 17143.72s]  It's back out, back out, back out, back out.
[17143.72s -> 17144.60s]  I got like capsules over here.
[17144.60s -> 17145.08s]  I didn't open.
[17145.96s -> 17149.24s]  No, no, no.
[17149.24s -> 17164.54s]  Eyeball jar and big snake wall.
[17164.54s -> 17164.78s]  Okay.
[17165.34s -> 17167.00s]  Who died?
[17167.00s -> 17167.40s]  Who is this?
[17168.04s -> 17169.83s]  Who did this eat?
[17169.83s -> 17170.71s]  What happened?
[17170.71s -> 17179.85s]  Eat the lasagna.
[17179.85s -> 17182.82s]  Where's the other dead body?
[17188.36s -> 17209.29s]  Oh, right here.
[17209.29s -> 17210.33s]  I'm feeding this to Courage.
[17210.33s -> 17211.37s]  I don't want Courage to die.
[17211.37s -> 17223.38s]  We need more deviled eggs.
[17223.38s -> 17223.86s]  Oh.
[17223.86s -> 17227.10s]  Proto and Tipsy.
[17227.10s -> 17227.90s]  That's the plan.
[17232.09s -> 17232.81s]  No, no, no, no.
[17232.81s -> 17233.61s]  No one's eating this.
[17233.61s -> 17234.09s]  I like this.
[17234.09s -> 17235.29s]  I like this one a lot.
[17235.29s -> 17235.85s]  I like this.
[17235.85s -> 17237.21s]  This is a good one.
[17237.21s -> 17239.83s]  Putting this in the memorial.
[17239.83s -> 17256.81s]  I don't know.
[17256.81s -> 17257.53s]  Stop.
[17257.53s -> 17262.98s]  Yeah.
[17262.98s -> 17263.62s]  This was Smush.
[17263.62s -> 17264.66s]  I like Smush a lot.
[17264.66s -> 17266.54s]  Smush was really cool.
[17266.54s -> 17277.42s]  Smush, a good dog.
[17277.42s -> 17287.51s]  There.
[17287.51s -> 17289.11s]  A little rowdy but loved everyone.
[17289.11s -> 17294.62s]  He's a good dog.
[17294.62s -> 17299.13s]  All right.
[17299.13s -> 17303.62s]  Go to sleep.
[17303.62s -> 17304.58s]  And go to sleep.
[17304.58s -> 17305.45s]  All right.
[17305.45s -> 17306.65s]  Rudolph, what do you got?
[17306.65s -> 17315.30s]  Starting to turn almost all golden.
[17317.21s -> 17323.24s]  Are those six legs?
[17323.24s -> 17329.99s]  Okay.
[17329.99s -> 17332.07s]  I lost a lot of leg gloss, but that's all right.
[17332.07s -> 17337.32s]  Tipsy, I need you to go to sleep.
[17337.32s -> 17340.63s]  Everyone else is fine.
[17340.63s -> 17342.46s]  Where's Tipsy?
[17342.54s -> 17345.11s]  Oh, there you are.
[17345.11s -> 17345.43s]  Okay.
[17345.43s -> 17345.99s]  Get in the house.
[17353.48s -> 17354.44s]  And sleep.
[17354.44s -> 17354.76s]  Okay.
[17354.76s -> 17355.00s]  Good.
[17355.64s -> 17356.28s]  Cool.
[17356.28s -> 17360.65s]  You look all right.
[17360.65s -> 17368.02s]  Upgrade the den.
[17368.02s -> 17368.42s]  I don't...
[17368.42s -> 17368.66s]  I don't...
[17368.66s -> 17372.02s]  Can I?
[17372.02s -> 17373.14s]  Corn dog.
[17373.14s -> 17385.29s]  Anyone piss on the ground?
[17385.29s -> 17386.78s]  Where's Snoopy?
[17386.78s -> 17387.42s]  Oh, shit.
[17387.42s -> 17387.90s]  You're right.
[17387.90s -> 17388.86s]  Where's Snoopy?
[17388.86s -> 17390.98s]  All right.
[17390.98s -> 17395.10s]  There's Snoopy.
[17395.10s -> 17395.82s]  Snoopy.
[17395.82s -> 17401.93s]  I didn't realize Snoopy was this little.
[17401.93s -> 17402.41s]  Uh-oh.
[17402.41s -> 17403.45s]  Tuba's dead.
[17403.45s -> 17408.20s]  Goodbye, Tuba.
[17408.20s -> 17433.16s]  This actually is really sad.
[17433.16s -> 17434.84s]  Courage is huge.
[17434.84s -> 17448.89s]  Should we memorialize Tuba or feed him to Courage?
[17448.89s -> 17449.29s]  I don't want...
[17449.29s -> 17453.26s]  I kind of want Courage to stay around.
[17453.26s -> 17454.46s]  Yeah, I want Courage to stick around.
[17475.80s -> 17481.10s]  Disgusting over here.
[17481.10s -> 17481.90s]  You monster.
[17484.30s -> 17485.42s]  It's a game mechanic.
[17485.42s -> 17487.34s]  I want some of them to stick around because they have...
[17487.34s -> 17487.90s]  They're really...
[17489.38s -> 17490.82s]  Like, he can walk around.
[17491.70s -> 17493.96s]  Are you telling me Courage and...
[17495.32s -> 17498.60s]  What are you guys doing?
[17498.60s -> 17507.37s]  I was going to combine these two,
[17507.37s -> 17509.05s]  but I don't think that's such a good idea.
[17509.05s -> 17514.06s]  Courage and Proto would be really good.
[17516.38s -> 17516.70s]  God.
[17519.43s -> 17520.07s]  I don't know.
[17520.07s -> 17520.87s]  You know what I mean?
[17520.87s -> 17523.37s]  How you doing, Snoopy?
[17523.37s -> 17524.41s]  You need some food?
[17524.41s -> 17528.68s]  Do it now?
[17528.68s -> 17529.88s]  I don't think I can.
[17535.27s -> 17536.22s]  Oh, I can.
[17536.22s -> 17536.62s]  I can.
[17536.62s -> 17536.94s]  I can.
[17536.94s -> 17537.66s]  Perfect.
[17537.66s -> 17538.71s]  All right.
[17538.71s -> 17539.11s]  Let's go.
[17539.67s -> 17540.63s]  This is it.
[17540.63s -> 17541.03s]  Let's do it.
[17559.58s -> 17560.94s]  We lost the spots.
[17560.94s -> 17571.82s]  Did we?
[17571.82s -> 17574.14s]  It was gone immediately.
[17574.14s -> 17580.30s]  He kind of looks like a little pig.
[17580.30s -> 17601.14s]  Look at this one.
[17601.14s -> 17627.32s]  They only have three legs.
[17627.32s -> 17646.65s]  I don't know what to do about this.
[17646.65s -> 17647.45s]  I don't think we can even...
[17647.45s -> 17648.97s]  We can't even fertilize this.
[17648.97s -> 17654.12s]  We got to hope for, like, just a huge mutation here.
[17654.12s -> 17666.86s]  Still three legs.
[17666.86s -> 17708.90s]  Sorry, I realized I was biting my lip,
[17709.54s -> 17710.66s]  and I don't want you to see it.
[17710.66s -> 17716.55s]  Do Proto and Tipsy.
[17716.55s -> 17718.23s]  Uh, Tipsy is not old enough.
[17718.23s -> 17720.07s]  I will when Tipsy's old enough.
[17720.07s -> 17723.82s]  Tripod?
[17723.82s -> 17735.62s]  Yeah, Tipsy's not an adult yet.
[17736.42s -> 17736.98s]  Do I even...
[17736.98s -> 17738.66s]  I don't even know if I want to hatch.
[17738.66s -> 17739.72s]  I mean, whatever.
[17739.72s -> 17742.30s]  Tipsy's getting bigger, though.
[17742.30s -> 17747.82s]  Everybody seems to be doing okay.
[17756.22s -> 17758.54s]  These two are the closest related...
[17758.54s -> 17759.18s]  Oh, my God.
[17759.18s -> 17759.58s]  I don't know.
[17759.58s -> 17760.22s]  I'm going to have to...
[17760.22s -> 17762.57s]  I was going to stream tomorrow, but maybe I won't.
[17764.23s -> 17765.91s]  I don't know what the fuck is going on here.
[17765.91s -> 17776.42s]  How come they're eating dirt?
[17776.42s -> 17776.90s]  Save the game.
[17776.90s -> 17777.38s]  Yep.
[17777.38s -> 17782.38s]  Give Tipsy a bigger body, please.
[17782.38s -> 17784.36s]  I honestly...
[17784.36s -> 17784.84s]  I need...
[17784.84s -> 17791.93s]  What does that?
[17791.93s -> 17794.17s]  Feed Tipsy a bunch of lasagna.
[17794.17s -> 17796.01s]  Come on, Tipsy.
[17796.01s -> 17796.33s]  Let's go.
[17798.26s -> 17798.74s]  Wrong room.
[17810.74s -> 17811.46s]  Lasagna.
[17811.46s -> 17815.34s]  Have some lasagna.
[17822.89s -> 17823.93s]  Maybe time to end the stream.
[17823.93s -> 17824.81s]  Don't hurt your voice.
[17824.81s -> 17828.22s]  I'll be okay.
[17828.22s -> 17828.86s]  All right.
[17828.86s -> 17829.42s]  Good.
[17829.42s -> 17829.90s]  Ooh.
[17829.90s -> 17831.16s]  A tooth.
[17831.16s -> 17835.91s]  Teeth make you big, too, don't they?
[17835.91s -> 17836.15s]  All right.
[17836.15s -> 17836.39s]  Good.
[17836.39s -> 17838.82s]  Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[17838.82s -> 17839.62s]  Um...
[17839.62s -> 17844.01s]  Want a pancake?
[17844.01s -> 17851.67s]  Turn this shit off.
[17851.67s -> 17861.37s]  Is it people saying Tripod?
[17861.37s -> 17862.17s]  Tripod?
[17862.17s -> 17876.86s]  Tripod sounds good.
[17876.86s -> 17879.46s]  Is that a raid?
[17879.46s -> 17879.78s]  Is there?
[17879.78s -> 17882.36s]  I don't see one.
[17882.36s -> 17883.64s]  The dashboard doesn't say anything.
[17883.64s -> 17888.63s]  Tripod is fucked, dude.
[17888.63s -> 17890.42s]  That is fucked.
[17890.42s -> 17891.38s]  Can I rename?
[17891.38s -> 17897.19s]  You gotta sing, it's Tomar.
[17897.19s -> 17898.39s]  What's up, Tomar?
[17898.39s -> 17902.71s]  Sorry, my voice is fucked up.
[17902.71s -> 17903.91s]  Snoopy is eating poop.
[17904.71s -> 17907.29s]  It doesn't matter, okay?
[17907.29s -> 17908.25s]  It really doesn't matter.
[17908.25s -> 17910.98s]  What's going on?
[17910.98s -> 17915.24s]  Thanks for, uh, thanks for stopping by.
[17915.24s -> 17917.08s]  Sing the Tomar theme song.
[17917.08s -> 17920.18s]  I don't know what that is.
[17920.18s -> 17922.10s]  Go to the dog storage, you can rename.
[17922.10s -> 17922.98s]  Yeah, that's fucking bad.
[17922.98s -> 17924.18s]  I don't want it to be that.
[17925.53s -> 17926.49s]  That's so awful.
[17926.49s -> 17931.98s]  No, I'm gonna name it, like, Breezy.
[17931.98s -> 17932.70s]  Breezy's better.
[17934.60s -> 17936.82s]  I like Breezy.
[17936.82s -> 17937.94s]  Breezy's fine.
[17937.94s -> 17943.11s]  You called one of your dogs Tipsy.
[17943.11s -> 17945.72s]  Yeah, like, teeny, like, Tipsy.
[17945.72s -> 17946.28s]  I don't know.
[17946.28s -> 17947.88s]  Wait, was that, was that bad?
[17949.35s -> 17950.15s]  Where is Tipsy?
[17952.87s -> 17954.71s]  But I, I was supposed to be, like, teeny.
[17958.62s -> 17959.74s]  All right, come on.
[17959.74s -> 17960.70s]  Let's see what we get here.
[17963.70s -> 17965.06s]  Like, itsy bitsy.
[17965.62s -> 17966.18s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[17966.18s -> 17967.38s]  I looked over in chat and somebody,
[17967.38s -> 17968.34s]  that was just rhymed.
[17976.84s -> 17978.52s]  You called the fucked up one Tipsy.
[17979.38s -> 17981.22s]  I don't think that's fair because I called,
[17984.31s -> 17985.11s]  what's this one called?
[17991.88s -> 17992.52s]  Eat one of these.
[17997.90s -> 17999.18s]  Worst parent ever.
[17999.18s -> 18000.86s]  It's not copium, I'm serious.
[18001.83s -> 18002.87s]  I'm serious.
[18002.87s -> 18004.47s]  It's not copium, I'm serious.
[18005.03s -> 18019.78s]  Okay, all right, we got something good.
[18019.78s -> 18033.21s]  And you can't get any smaller.
[18033.21s -> 18043.48s]  My god, dude, what the fuck?
[18043.48s -> 18044.44s]  That was evil.
[18044.44s -> 18045.48s]  I didn't even touch that.
[18045.48s -> 18046.36s]  I didn't do anything.
[18049.62s -> 18051.46s]  Tipsy's been eating lasagna all day.
[18051.46s -> 18052.66s]  How is it possible?
[18052.66s -> 18067.69s]  That was at least 15 feet.
[18068.89s -> 18070.25s]  That was at least 15 feet.
[18070.25s -> 18076.74s]  I think we're on the right track.
[18076.74s -> 18083.45s]  That's, I don't like that name.
[18083.45s -> 18084.65s]  I actually don't like that name.
[18084.65s -> 18086.41s]  That name is so fucking awful.
[18086.41s -> 18088.01s]  Something else, something else, something else.
[18088.97s -> 18089.93s]  Where's my storage?
[18089.93s -> 18090.89s]  Something else, something else.
[18090.89s -> 18091.61s]  I don't like that name.
[18092.33s -> 18093.21s]  I don't like that name.
[18093.69s -> 18099.58s]  How do I rename?
[18100.14s -> 18117.62s]  How do you rename?
[18117.62s -> 18118.10s]  Brunch?
[18118.10s -> 18118.58s]  I don't know.
[18119.38s -> 18120.10s]  Brunch.
[18120.10s -> 18123.24s]  There, that's better.
[18125.19s -> 18125.83s]  Brunch.
[18125.83s -> 18140.81s]  I don't know what you're doing.
[18140.81s -> 18150.02s]  I think, I think he's trying to...
[18150.02s -> 18158.86s]  You all right?
[18158.86s -> 18159.82s]  She puked.
[18159.82s -> 18172.78s]  Pretty pumped up about that, by the way.
[18175.14s -> 18191.72s]  Hey, hey, you need to breed Snoopy.
[18191.72s -> 18196.12s]  I like the color scheme.
[18196.12s -> 18197.24s]  Not much change, it's fine.
[18197.24s -> 18198.12s]  Okay, so can I?
[18198.12s -> 18198.76s]  Let's see.
[18198.76s -> 18200.78s]  Tipsy's not old enough.
[18200.78s -> 18202.47s]  Can't happen.
[18202.47s -> 18203.67s]  One more mutation.
[18203.67s -> 18207.24s]  When did the dog stop fighting?
[18209.02s -> 18210.22s]  There's been a few fights already.
[18211.61s -> 18212.97s]  I had to break up a couple of them.
[18212.97s -> 18213.93s]  One of them was really bad.
[18214.57s -> 18217.90s]  One just wouldn't let go.
[18217.90s -> 18219.18s]  It's like, kind of fucked up.
[18223.58s -> 18224.70s]  Just checking to see if something piss.
[18225.26s -> 18236.28s]  My brunch is ready to mutate.
[18236.28s -> 18254.14s]  Anybody hungry or anything?
[18254.14s -> 18255.64s]  Snoopy's tired.
[18255.64s -> 18260.92s]  Oops, I'm sorry.
[18260.92s -> 18262.28s]  Come over here and sleep.
[18262.28s -> 18263.32s]  You don't, you get...
[18263.32s -> 18267.45s]  Come here, it's okay, come here.
[18267.45s -> 18268.09s]  Stay in the corner.
[18268.65s -> 18269.61s]  Courage is a big dog.
[18269.61s -> 18270.49s]  Be careful.
[18270.49s -> 18283.83s]  Not much of a change.
[18285.26s -> 18288.36s]  I don't think they ate very much.
[18288.36s -> 18288.92s]  No, they didn't.
[18292.92s -> 18294.28s]  Eat some lasagna.
[18294.28s -> 18296.31s]  Here.
[18296.31s -> 18297.27s]  Lasagna makes you big.
[18302.65s -> 18303.69s]  Oh, Tipsy, I'm so sorry.
[18303.69s -> 18304.17s]  You need help.
[18304.17s -> 18304.65s]  Okay.
[18304.65s -> 18305.53s]  Tipsy needs to eat.
[18309.24s -> 18309.72s]  I don't know.
[18310.36s -> 18312.20s]  I keep trying to feed Tipsy stuff,
[18312.20s -> 18312.84s]  but it doesn't work.
[18313.72s -> 18314.70s]  Deviled eggs, right?
[18315.34s -> 18316.63s]  A couple of deviled eggs?
[18333.51s -> 18334.71s]  All right, let's relax for a second.
[18334.71s -> 18335.43s]  And you should go to sleep.
[18336.07s -> 18338.55s]  French fries?
[18350.23s -> 18351.03s]  I know, all right.
[18351.03s -> 18352.31s]  Tipsy's sleeping.
[18352.31s -> 18353.58s]  I'm gonna leave Tipsy alone.
[18359.05s -> 18360.17s]  Eat this coconut.
[18360.17s -> 18365.37s]  This is dirt, never...
[18365.37s -> 18366.65s]  Okay, well, whatever.
[18366.65s -> 18367.77s]  He's delayed it.
[18367.77s -> 18373.46s]  How come Tipsy's built like that?
[18373.46s -> 18376.34s]  It's because we were doing some experiments.
[18376.98s -> 18378.57s]  I kind of just ended up that way.
[18379.85s -> 18384.52s]  Hello, brunch.
[18384.52s -> 18388.25s]  Sarah, are you okay?
[18388.25s -> 18391.78s]  You looking to play?
[18391.78s -> 18392.50s]  Here, play with the ball.
[18393.06s -> 18395.96s]  Throw it.
[18395.96s -> 18397.08s]  Throw that ball.
[18397.08s -> 18399.93s]  Oh, jump on it.
[18399.93s -> 18400.81s]  Throw it.
[18400.81s -> 18408.87s]  Go get it.
[18408.87s -> 18412.18s]  You have too many legs.
[18412.18s -> 18412.82s]  Nobody can...
[18412.82s -> 18413.62s]  This whole time,
[18413.62s -> 18415.06s]  no one's been able to do anything.
[18415.06s -> 18419.08s]  They have too many legs.
[18419.08s -> 18420.36s]  They can't even run.
[18420.36s -> 18424.33s]  Is that...
[18429.42s -> 18431.34s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[18431.34s -> 18432.86s]  I'm trying to move him over to the ball.
[18433.50s -> 18442.60s]  Okay, get it.
[18442.60s -> 18451.05s]  Have a coconut.
[18451.05s -> 18458.39s]  Oh, shit.
[18458.39s -> 18458.87s]  Cool.
[18458.87s -> 18465.37s]  Play dead.
[18465.37s -> 18466.57s]  New trick.
[18466.57s -> 18467.91s]  Nice trick.
[18467.91s -> 18468.79s]  Very good job.
[18468.79s -> 18469.51s]  Good, good, good.
[18469.51s -> 18470.39s]  Good trick.
[18470.39s -> 18473.94s]  What are you doing over there?
[18473.94s -> 18475.83s]  Playing with some dirt?
[18475.83s -> 18476.71s]  That's funny.
[18476.71s -> 18479.70s]  That's funny.
[18484.10s -> 18484.90s]  Throw it.
[18484.90s -> 18488.47s]  I don't know what you're throwing.
[18490.23s -> 18500.44s]  I don't know what you're...
[18500.44s -> 18501.64s]  I don't know what's...
[18501.64s -> 18503.00s]  Okay, I think he's falling asleep.
[18503.72s -> 18507.43s]  He's sleeping standing up.
[18508.07s -> 18519.80s]  I don't have any den upgrades.
[18520.44s -> 18526.41s]  Courage is hungry.
[18526.97s -> 18531.13s]  I need to at least level up.
[18531.13s -> 18532.01s]  Tipsy.
[18532.01s -> 18538.31s]  French fries.
[18539.11s -> 18541.18s]  Yeah, have another french fry.
[18541.18s -> 18546.68s]  Come on, you can get it.
[18546.68s -> 18547.86s]  There you go.
[18547.86s -> 18548.66s]  There you go.
[18548.66s -> 18550.55s]  You can do it.
[18555.35s -> 18556.87s]  There's progress here with tips.
[18556.87s -> 18557.67s]  I think we just need to...
[18557.67s -> 18559.27s]  The legs need to be spread out more.
[18559.27s -> 18560.97s]  I need body length.
[18560.97s -> 18562.17s]  French fries should do it, I hope.
[18563.94s -> 18564.42s]  I hope so.
[18569.72s -> 18571.16s]  Just with a little bit of increased body,
[18571.88s -> 18574.97s]  they can move around.
[18574.97s -> 18581.83s]  Courage you need.
[18583.86s -> 18584.74s]  Eat something.
[18584.74s -> 18585.30s]  Have one of these.
[18586.89s -> 18590.84s]  Here, eat that.
[18590.84s -> 18591.32s]  That was it?
[18591.32s -> 18591.64s]  Really?
[18591.64s -> 18593.56s]  How about I have a chicken?
[18593.56s -> 18594.36s]  Oh, no, corn dog.
[18594.36s -> 18595.48s]  Yeah, that's a new thing.
[18595.48s -> 18598.15s]  Here, try that.
[18598.15s -> 18603.62s]  Oh, shit.
[18603.62s -> 18604.58s]  Right, Rudolph.
[18604.58s -> 18610.55s]  Interesting.
[18611.51s -> 18612.49s]  Much bigger head.
[18615.29s -> 18616.01s]  Back length.
[18616.82s -> 18617.62s]  Back leg width.
[18619.61s -> 18620.33s]  A lot of growth.
[18620.97s -> 18624.26s]  Bigger legs.
[18624.26s -> 18625.38s]  That's probably better.
[18625.38s -> 18626.66s]  That's probably helps.
[18626.66s -> 18630.04s]  All right, have one of these.
[18630.04s -> 18633.40s]  Have one of those chips.
[18634.04s -> 18635.99s]  And the nose is getting red again, yeah?
[18635.99s -> 18636.63s]  That looks cool.
[18638.31s -> 18641.24s]  I'm supposed to eat a cocoon, why not?
[18645.43s -> 18646.95s]  How close are you to evolving?
[18646.95s -> 18650.34s]  Have some corn.
[18650.90s -> 18652.42s]  You like corn?
[18658.47s -> 18660.07s]  Seen but often not heard.
[18666.87s -> 18668.79s]  I think we're going to get a good evolution here with tipsy.
[18673.29s -> 18673.85s]  Come over here.
[18673.85s -> 18675.05s]  Come downstairs.
[18675.05s -> 18678.87s]  I want you to participate.
[18678.87s -> 18680.15s]  I don't want you to just be up here by yourself.
[18680.15s -> 18681.51s]  Come on, come up here.
[18681.51s -> 18683.74s]  I want you to participate.
[18683.74s -> 18684.38s]  Come have fun.
[18684.94s -> 18687.99s]  Let's put on some music.
[18688.55s -> 18691.16s]  Let's get some tunes on.
[18691.72s -> 18694.12s]  And have everybody come over here and hang out.
[18694.12s -> 18702.55s]  Why are you biting his tail?
[18702.55s -> 18707.14s]  Don't bite his tail.
[18707.14s -> 18707.70s]  There we go.
[18713.46s -> 18713.70s]  Look.
[18714.42s -> 18716.79s]  This is all right.
[18716.79s -> 18717.35s]  Good, good.
[18717.35s -> 18718.15s]  Here comes the evolution.
[18720.42s -> 18721.06s]  Okay, come on.
[18721.70s -> 18724.28s]  See if we can...
[18725.00s -> 18727.42s]  The body just needs to lengthen and that's probably fine.
[18727.42s -> 18729.74s]  I don't want tipsy to be up there by itself.
[18729.74s -> 18730.78s]  No, I'm good.
[18730.78s -> 18733.24s]  What are you doing?
[18733.24s -> 18745.72s]  Jungle carpet?
[18745.72s -> 18747.40s]  That's a screenshot if I've ever seen it.
[18747.40s -> 18747.96s]  That's so cute.
[18748.52s -> 18758.81s]  All right, come on.
[18759.37s -> 18759.85s]  What do we got?
[18760.41s -> 18764.07s]  I think that's better.
[18765.48s -> 18769.59s]  Yep.
[18769.59s -> 18770.39s]  Front top leg.
[18771.32s -> 18772.52s]  Body girth.
[18772.52s -> 18774.20s]  Body length has increased.
[18774.20s -> 18780.55s]  Okay, it's increased by a little bit.
[18780.55s -> 18781.51s]  By 3.2%.
[18785.00s -> 18789.37s]  Slim down.
[18789.37s -> 18794.25s]  Okay.
[18794.25s -> 18796.73s]  All right, that actually looks better.
[18796.73s -> 18799.10s]  That actually looks a lot better.
[18799.10s -> 18804.33s]  I think one more evolution with a little bit of length and...
[18805.37s -> 18806.18s]  You lost a leg?
[18806.74s -> 18812.26s]  No, you didn't.
[18812.26s -> 18815.99s]  Proto, what are you up to?
[18815.99s -> 18818.09s]  All right, now we can do this.
[18818.09s -> 18818.73s]  We can breed, yeah.
[18822.71s -> 18823.91s]  Tipsy and Proto.
[18824.47s -> 18825.40s]  Okay, here we go.
[18825.40s -> 18825.80s]  Let's do it.
[18825.80s -> 18826.36s]  Let's see it.
[18826.36s -> 18826.76s]  This is it.
[18827.00s -> 18827.48s]  This is the big one.
[18830.47s -> 18834.18s]  Got spots.
[18846.78s -> 18847.50s]  Oh, wow.
[18848.30s -> 18848.86s]  Oh, wow.
[18849.94s -> 18850.26s]  Wow.
[18851.42s -> 18851.74s]  Okay.
[18852.30s -> 18855.43s]  That's when his heart's all over it.
[18859.83s -> 18861.83s]  There are two candidates here.
[18861.83s -> 18864.07s]  I wonder if I should keep going.
[18865.27s -> 18866.79s]  Or just grab the one with the hearts.
[18872.09s -> 18872.65s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[18873.80s -> 18874.20s]  Very cool.
[18876.30s -> 18877.66s]  I could do this again, too.
[18877.66s -> 18897.66s]  I want to do Proto and Rudolph.
[18897.66s -> 18899.85s]  I want some more spots.
[18900.49s -> 18905.72s]  Okay, that's kind of cool.
[18905.72s -> 18906.44s]  Anybody have spots?
[18908.42s -> 18912.22s]  You do and you do.
[18918.04s -> 18918.60s]  Very cool.
[18918.60s -> 18921.08s]  All right, the hearts again.
[18921.72s -> 18927.24s]  Another variation.
[18927.80s -> 18946.14s]  Very cool.
[18946.14s -> 18946.94s]  New tail.
[18946.94s -> 18948.52s]  Wait, there was a new tail?
[18948.52s -> 18951.37s]  That is a new tail, isn't it?
[18951.37s -> 18970.39s]  I don't want to go much further here.
[18970.39s -> 18971.27s]  I think this is perfect.
[18971.27s -> 18974.39s]  Who from this litter though?
[18974.39s -> 18975.11s]  Probably you.
[18975.11s -> 18979.21s]  Probably this one.
[18979.21s -> 18979.77s]  New pattern?
[18980.33s -> 18980.89s]  Oh, shit.
[18980.89s -> 18981.69s]  There is a new pattern.
[18982.25s -> 18985.48s]  All right, we're taking this one.
[18986.04s -> 18998.23s]  All right, I'll take this next one to zero.
[18998.23s -> 18999.27s]  Oh, I don't have another egg.
[18999.27s -> 19003.58s]  Do I?
[19003.58s -> 19005.10s]  I'm going to have to store some people.
[19005.74s -> 19009.64s]  What do I store?
[19010.28s -> 19012.89s]  I don't know.
[19012.89s -> 19016.31s]  Who should I store?
[19016.31s -> 19017.67s]  I'm going to have way too many people.
[19017.67s -> 19025.08s]  It's the one with hearts.
[19030.86s -> 19031.36s]  Cupid?
[19033.51s -> 19034.79s]  Oh, I like Valentine.
[19036.84s -> 19037.64s]  Valentine's a good one.
[19041.78s -> 19042.82s]  I'm going to store Rudolph.
[19042.82s -> 19043.70s]  That's a good idea.
[19047.72s -> 19056.33s]  Maybe store Rudolph and maybe Proto?
[19056.33s -> 19066.74s]  That's a good idea.
[19066.74s -> 19068.18s]  I got to clean up a little bit for a second.
[19068.18s -> 19068.68s]  Hold on.
[19079.02s -> 19079.52s]  A mess.
[19079.98s -> 19088.33s]  I'll leave a little garden down here.
[19088.33s -> 19090.12s]  That's fine.
[19090.12s -> 19091.56s]  None of this is a bullshit.
[19105.64s -> 19107.08s]  You've already mutated already?
[19107.08s -> 19107.58s]  Okay.
[19112.34s -> 19113.14s]  All right, this is...
[19113.14s -> 19116.15s]  What's my name?
[19116.15s -> 19120.71s]  This dog.
[19120.71s -> 19123.21s]  How about like Macaron?
[19123.21s -> 19123.71s]  That's a good one.
[19126.06s -> 19127.24s]  Sponge?
[19131.46s -> 19131.96s]  Sweetie?
[19133.13s -> 19134.01s]  Sweetie's not bad.
[19135.77s -> 19136.27s]  Jason?
[19136.89s -> 19142.74s]  How about Spongy?
[19149.64s -> 19150.68s]  Where's Tipsy?
[19150.68s -> 19151.24s]  Oh, right there.
[19151.24s -> 19151.48s]  Okay.
[19151.48s -> 19159.30s]  Tipsy's asleep?
[19159.30s -> 19160.50s]  Her just digging more.
[19160.50s -> 19161.38s]  Oh, keep doing that.
[19162.26s -> 19162.90s]  Very good job.
[19163.46s -> 19165.99s]  All right.
[19165.99s -> 19167.51s]  Tipsy, go to bed over here.
[19167.51s -> 19173.32s]  I got to do some decorating.
[19174.20s -> 19182.31s]  I don't even have to upgrade the den.
[19183.19s -> 19184.26s]  Doing it for me.
[19201.93s -> 19209.99s]  Jesus.
[19209.99s -> 19210.95s]  Taking forever.
[19211.59s -> 19212.31s]  Holy shit.
[19213.64s -> 19214.28s]  Check achievements.
[19214.84s -> 19226.47s]  I want to say 34% taller.
[19226.47s -> 19231.86s]  Wasn't that tall to begin with, but...
[19231.86s -> 19232.90s]  I guess it's a little bit bigger.
[19233.86s -> 19237.80s]  All right, I've been playing for five hours.
[19237.80s -> 19241.80s]  I have...
[19241.80s -> 19242.76s]  Okay, hold on a second.
[19242.76s -> 19244.12s]  This is where it gets weird.
[19244.12s -> 19261.45s]  Oh, shit.
[19261.45s -> 19261.95s]  Okay.
[19262.81s -> 19271.80s]  I have to redo this whole thing.
[19271.80s -> 19275.30s]  Oh, do I?
[19275.30s -> 19276.18s]  No, I don't.
[19276.18s -> 19279.40s]  They don't all have to be connected to each other.
[19290.65s -> 19359.91s]  Oh, shit.
[19359.91s -> 19360.55s]  I'm sorry.
[19360.55s -> 19370.46s]  I got so many more rooms.
[19370.46s -> 19372.68s]  I need some planning.
[19372.68s -> 19374.04s]  I need to plan this better.
[19374.04s -> 19378.36s]  This is the starting room, which is going to have...
[19378.36s -> 19380.49s]  It's very basic.
[19380.49s -> 19381.50s]  I like the clouds.
[19381.50s -> 19382.46s]  Clouds are fine.
[19382.46s -> 19388.65s]  Messing up.
[19388.65s -> 19390.02s]  That's not bad.
[19390.02s -> 19390.66s]  All right, I like that.
[19391.62s -> 19392.98s]  Oh, I got to figure out what...
[19392.98s -> 19394.94s]  Okay, this is the memorial.
[19394.94s -> 19395.82s]  I can stay that way.
[19395.82s -> 19396.30s]  One of my...
[19396.30s -> 19397.50s]  This is the food room.
[19397.50s -> 19398.70s]  Let's have two food rooms.
[19407.91s -> 19410.79s]  Okay, all the food has to be in one spot.
[19455.66s -> 19456.06s]  What the...
[19456.06s -> 19457.42s]  I can make them small?
[19457.42s -> 19462.95s]  Why didn't I do this in the first place?
[19462.95s -> 19477.27s]  I didn't know I could make them that small.
[19477.27s -> 19483.35s]  This is pretty huge.
[19483.35s -> 19484.20s]  Perfect.
[19484.20s -> 19484.84s]  Okay, cool.
[19484.84s -> 19488.36s]  Very cool.
[19488.36s -> 19491.51s]  Now, this room is kind of ugly.
[19491.51s -> 19493.35s]  I don't really like the carpet that much.
[19493.35s -> 19495.91s]  It's hard to even see the food on the floor.
[19495.91s -> 19498.54s]  What, like a cafeteria?
[19498.54s -> 19499.66s]  That sounds better to me.
[19499.66s -> 19505.93s]  Pull this room down a little.
[19505.93s -> 19518.63s]  Okay.
[19518.63s -> 19519.43s]  No, I don't need that.
[19519.43s -> 19520.15s]  It looks good.
[19520.15s -> 19522.09s]  All right, that's the food room.
[19522.09s -> 19526.20s]  So then all other food, get rid of it.
[19526.20s -> 19527.64s]  I don't want this anymore.
[19527.64s -> 19534.06s]  Put the couch over here somewhere like right here.
[19536.87s -> 19538.31s]  The memorials will go here.
[19538.31s -> 19544.82s]  I'll probably have a few of those in a minute.
[19544.82s -> 19545.54s]  What is this place?
[19546.94s -> 19547.58s]  This is the toy room.
[19547.58s -> 19548.54s]  Okay, the toy room is fine.
[19548.54s -> 19549.82s]  We'll just get rid of this.
[19549.82s -> 19562.34s]  Okay, this is the play room.
[19562.34s -> 19563.38s]  So it's gonna stay like this.
[19563.38s -> 19564.26s]  This is okay.
[19564.26s -> 19567.32s]  There's no food.
[19567.32s -> 19568.44s]  It's just too much food.
[19568.44s -> 19570.28s]  Well, they'll go get the food down there.
[19570.28s -> 19578.20s]  Play room, sleep room, memorial, cafeteria.
[19578.20s -> 19579.82s]  What should this be?
[19579.82s -> 19585.32s]  What should this be?
[19588.31s -> 19589.03s]  Is a tree in the way?
[19591.18s -> 19597.93s]  Make this the anti-gravity room.
[19597.93s -> 19598.25s]  Okay.
[19598.81s -> 19600.17s]  No, I don't want to do that.
[19600.17s -> 19600.97s]  That sounds horrible.
[19601.69s -> 19603.69s]  Make it space because it's an anti-gravity room.
[19613.00s -> 19615.99s]  And then this will be the garden.
[19615.99s -> 19618.46s]  This is the garden.
[19618.46s -> 19624.73s]  Perfect.
[19624.73s -> 19626.78s]  All right.
[19626.78s -> 19628.62s]  Switch the food in the memorial room.
[19628.62s -> 19632.18s]  That's a good point.
[19632.18s -> 19634.30s]  That's a good point.
[19634.30s -> 19635.10s]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[19635.10s -> 19636.06s]  So I don't have to go as far.
[19636.86s -> 19637.34s]  Good point.
[19658.97s -> 19665.58s]  Those still exist, right?
[19665.58s -> 19689.64s]  Oh, I'm playing chess while the game's playing checkers.
[19689.64s -> 19691.32s]  Like what the fuck am I doing?
[19691.32s -> 19699.58s]  Although, do those still exist?
[19699.58s -> 19701.18s]  The memorials exist, right?
[19701.18s -> 19704.20s]  They're not gone, are they?
[19704.20s -> 19705.00s]  They better be.
[19705.00s -> 19709.21s]  I think they're still there.
[19709.21s -> 19709.93s]  People are hungry.
[19709.93s -> 19710.41s]  All right.
[19710.41s -> 19711.45s]  Come on, come on, come on.
[19711.45s -> 19712.49s]  There's nothing there.
[19712.49s -> 19733.46s]  Arm is killing me.
[19733.46s -> 19735.27s]  Why am I so fucked up today?
[19735.27s -> 19736.71s]  I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.
[19736.71s -> 19752.04s]  That's fine.
[19754.57s -> 19762.63s]  He's falling apart.
[19762.63s -> 19763.51s]  Get nice and cool in here.
[19763.51s -> 19763.83s]  Okay.
[19763.83s -> 19764.39s]  All right.
[19764.39s -> 19765.03s]  Now they can eat.
[19765.03s -> 19765.75s]  They can get food.
[19765.75s -> 19771.54s]  And now let's put the memorial stuff down here.
[19771.54s -> 19786.36s]  Thank goodness.
[19786.36s -> 19786.76s]  Sag.
[19787.99s -> 19788.23s]  I don't know.
[19788.23s -> 19790.09s]  Maybe I am getting sick.
[19790.09s -> 19791.45s]  I don't think I am.
[19791.45s -> 19793.30s]  That'd be kind of annoying if I was.
[19799.51s -> 19800.55s]  Let me clean this up.
[19800.55s -> 19810.47s]  Get a tree in here.
[19810.47s -> 19818.04s]  This dude's farming his sagges.
[19818.04s -> 19819.64s]  Oh, I don't think I feel good.
[19819.64s -> 19820.84s]  Um, I don't feel good.
[19822.12s -> 19827.26s]  The dogs are starving.
[19827.26s -> 19831.64s]  You're right.
[19831.64s -> 19831.96s]  All right.
[19831.96s -> 19833.80s]  Food, food, food, food, food.
[19833.80s -> 19835.24s]  Food, food, food.
[19835.24s -> 19837.51s]  Everyone's starving.
[19837.51s -> 19840.10s]  Oh, oh my god.
[19840.10s -> 19845.35s]  Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
[19845.35s -> 19847.99s]  Tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy.
[19847.99s -> 19848.31s]  What do you want?
[19848.31s -> 19848.63s]  What do you want?
[19848.63s -> 19855.48s]  Lasagna, lasagna, lasagna, lasagna.
[19855.48s -> 19856.20s]  Right there, right there.
[19856.20s -> 19857.48s]  It's eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[19857.48s -> 19863.11s]  Okay.
[19863.11s -> 19864.63s]  I forgot the game doesn't pause.
[19864.63s -> 19865.27s]  Okay.
[19865.27s -> 19869.51s]  Because I've, it's, you're okay.
[19869.51s -> 19873.48s]  Okay, back, you can go back to sleep.
[19873.48s -> 19874.20s]  Very good.
[19874.20s -> 19888.76s]  Think of that we got corn dogs in the corner here.
[19888.76s -> 19889.72s]  They're fine.
[19889.72s -> 19905.56s]  They've got, seriously, they got corn dogs.
[19905.56s -> 19925.46s]  Just taking much more effort.
[19925.46s -> 19932.12s]  Okay, cool.
[19932.12s -> 19933.51s]  What we got?
[19933.51s -> 19940.17s]  I think, uh, brunch grew a lot.
[19940.17s -> 19948.52s]  There's a little base now.
[19948.52s -> 19952.04s]  Snout rotation minus 30 percent.
[19952.04s -> 19954.95s]  Courage is dying.
[19954.95s -> 19960.58s]  That don't look like dying to me.
[19960.58s -> 19963.86s]  That looks like having a great time.
[19963.86s -> 19975.27s]  They have a corn dog.
[19975.27s -> 19975.91s]  Dying.
[19975.91s -> 20006.78s]  That's not dying.
[20006.78s -> 20013.32s]  Ooh, coke got a lot darker.
[20013.32s -> 20017.00s]  Interesting.
[20017.00s -> 20020.68s]  17 percent taller.
[20020.68s -> 20021.08s]  Very cool.
[20027.05s -> 20033.46s]  Courage and storage so they don't die.
[20033.46s -> 20035.70s]  Pattern metallic plus 20 percent.
[20035.70s -> 20038.17s]  What's that mean?
[20038.17s -> 20038.81s]  Shinier?
[20038.81s -> 20047.27s]  What does metallic pattern mean?
[20047.27s -> 20049.35s]  This motivated me to sit with my dog.
[20049.35s -> 20050.15s]  Oh, that's cute.
[20050.15s -> 20069.98s]  Tipsy, you want to play?
[20069.98s -> 20070.78s]  Good throw.
[20070.78s -> 20072.01s]  Nice job.
[20075.03s -> 20076.63s]  Okay, french fries for tipsy, right?
[20076.63s -> 20103.94s]  A little bit more body length and we'll be fine.
[20103.94s -> 20111.03s]  What the fuck is going on?
[20111.03s -> 20119.50s]  I, you need to go to sleep.
[20119.50s -> 20121.18s]  Somewhere comfortable in the corner so you don't,
[20121.18s -> 20123.83s]  I don't want you to get beat up or anything.
[20123.83s -> 20125.75s]  Under the AC?
[20125.75s -> 20126.63s]  Yeah, right here.
[20126.63s -> 20128.79s]  There you go.
[20128.79s -> 20131.53s]  Get some sleep.
[20131.53s -> 20131.93s]  It's okay.
[20131.93s -> 20132.25s]  That's all right.
[20132.25s -> 20132.65s]  All right.
[20132.65s -> 20133.85s]  Right in front of the AC.
[20133.85s -> 20139.22s]  Nice and cool.
[20139.22s -> 20140.10s]  I love tipsy.
[20140.10s -> 20141.38s]  Tipsy is amazing.
[20141.38s -> 20148.81s]  Courage is ancient.
[20149.96s -> 20151.16s]  Maybe it is time to store courage.
[20153.13s -> 20154.09s]  Yeah, I'll do it.
[20154.09s -> 20164.79s]  I don't want to lose them.
[20164.79s -> 20165.91s]  Make a wind vortex.
[20165.91s -> 20166.87s]  Oh, I was gonna make the uh,
[20166.87s -> 20168.39s]  okay, everyone seems to be okay now.
[20168.39s -> 20172.47s]  This is the anti-gravity room, right?
[20172.47s -> 20173.11s]  Yeah.
[20173.11s -> 20192.92s]  Mars or should I just do anti-gravity?
[20192.92s -> 20207.14s]  Is this fun?
[20207.14s -> 20208.68s]  Do they think this is fun?
[20208.68s -> 20222.49s]  I think that, I think they're having a good time.
[20222.49s -> 20226.12s]  Send tipsy's hanging out having a good time.
[20226.12s -> 20238.18s]  No, another french fry and I think we'll have enough length for tipsy to be able to
[20240.07s -> 20241.11s]  really just kind of move around.
[20241.11s -> 20241.91s]  I think it should be fine.
[20242.47s -> 20244.79s]  Very tipsy.
[20244.79s -> 20253.05s]  I have one of these.
[20253.05s -> 20257.91s]  There you go.
[20257.91s -> 20259.67s]  Food in this game is making me hungry.
[20259.67s -> 20260.79s]  I'm getting hungry too.
[20260.79s -> 20261.35s]  What time is it?
[20261.99s -> 20266.10s]  Yeah, end of the stream voice coming up here in a minute.
[20266.98s -> 20269.86s]  I'm gonna get some food and I'm gonna try to figure out what the hell's going on in here.
[20272.14s -> 20273.88s]  It's way strong.
[20273.88s -> 20274.28s]  All right.
[20274.28s -> 20277.00s]  Way stronger than like an hour ago.
[20277.00s -> 20283.03s]  Like I said, five to ten percent more body length than I think it's perfect.
[20283.03s -> 20284.31s]  I think it's gonna be fine.
[20284.31s -> 20285.80s]  I'll show you.
[20285.80s -> 20286.68s]  It's not my sinuses.
[20286.68s -> 20289.64s]  It's like back like here like in here.
[20289.64s -> 20290.36s]  It's really weird.
[20292.07s -> 20293.27s]  I'm sorry about that.
[20293.27s -> 20296.79s]  I didn't think I was gonna be like a fucking chain smoker today.
[20299.30s -> 20300.87s]  This is my tonsils.
[20301.59s -> 20302.07s]  It's like deeper.
[20302.07s -> 20302.71s]  It's like down here.
[20303.27s -> 20303.91s]  Like in here.
[20304.63s -> 20313.02s]  Take a nap over here maybe.
[20313.66s -> 20319.86s]  Yeah, this is a lot more walking than tipsy's done.
[20319.86s -> 20321.62s]  So this is the I'm actually happy about this.
[20322.26s -> 20329.62s]  That body length was really bad before but now oh there we go.
[20329.62s -> 20330.10s]  Hell yeah.
[20331.06s -> 20331.38s]  Yes.
[20332.42s -> 20332.74s]  Yes.
[20334.65s -> 20334.89s]  Yes.
[20335.53s -> 20344.09s]  Play with the ball.
[20344.09s -> 20350.84s]  Spongy play with the ball.
[20350.84s -> 20351.64s]  Why ain't I playing with the ball?
[20354.09s -> 20357.16s]  Good throw.
[20357.16s -> 20358.12s]  That was a great throw.
[20365.13s -> 20367.21s]  Wait, that's the anti-gravity chamber?
[20367.21s -> 20373.74s]  Where did where did tipsy go?
[20373.74s -> 20378.07s]  Where's tipsy?
[20378.63s -> 20381.88s]  Oh, there we go.
[20381.88s -> 20385.08s]  Look at how happy tipsy is being able to move around.
[20385.08s -> 20388.54s]  This is great.
[20390.01s -> 20392.57s]  Actually what are as aggressive actually great development.
[20393.62s -> 20394.10s]  Look at that.
[20399.61s -> 20399.93s]  Yes.
[20400.73s -> 20401.77s]  It actually makes me really happy.
[20401.77s -> 20402.97s]  That's like I'm glad.
[20403.61s -> 20405.51s]  All right.
[20405.51s -> 20406.31s]  Be careful.
[20414.12s -> 20415.16s]  Look they're having fun.
[20417.22s -> 20417.62s]  Yes.
[20418.42s -> 20422.82s]  We've got a good ending.
[20422.82s -> 20425.10s]  I'm curious with another evolution though.
[20430.76s -> 20431.88s]  This is a cute game.
[20431.88s -> 20433.00s]  How much is this game?
[20433.00s -> 20436.15s]  This is really fun.
[20436.15s -> 20437.11s]  This is just like chill.
[20437.11s -> 20437.59s]  I loved it.
[20438.23s -> 20441.38s]  It's 20 bucks.
[20441.38s -> 20442.87s]  Yeah.
[20442.87s -> 20443.51s]  This is really cute.
[20449.13s -> 20449.77s]  Oh look it.
[20452.36s -> 20458.31s]  Go go go go go go go.
[20458.31s -> 20459.51s]  They're both doing so well.
[20461.29s -> 20462.17s]  Yeah.
[20462.17s -> 20462.57s]  Perfect.
[20469.46s -> 20470.18s]  All right.
[20470.18s -> 20470.50s]  Okay.
[20470.50s -> 20471.14s]  Ready to relax.
[20471.14s -> 20471.78s]  No more music.
[20472.42s -> 20473.85s]  Let's get some food.
[20474.41s -> 20476.09s]  Snoopy I don't know.
[20476.09s -> 20477.21s]  I think you're like stuck in here.
[20480.18s -> 20481.22s]  Snoopy be careful.
[20481.22s -> 20482.58s]  I wouldn't go in that room.
[20482.58s -> 20486.04s]  Okay.
[20486.04s -> 20486.44s]  You're fine.
[20487.00s -> 20489.62s]  Is there any food?
[20489.62s -> 20489.86s]  All right.
[20489.86s -> 20490.98s]  There's a pizza bagel over here.
[20490.98s -> 20491.54s]  You can eat that.
[20492.98s -> 20494.26s]  Eat this pizza bagel.
[20494.26s -> 20494.74s]  There you go.
[20502.58s -> 20504.87s]  Eww.
[20504.87s -> 20505.27s]  Uh okay.
[20505.27s -> 20506.71s]  You need to go this way to get some food.
[20508.01s -> 20522.65s]  All right.
[20522.65s -> 20523.29s]  Snack time.
[20525.00s -> 20526.36s]  How about a moon cheese?
[20526.36s -> 20526.92s]  That sounds good.
[20527.56s -> 20538.07s]  What else is hungry?
[20538.07s -> 20538.31s]  You?
[20538.31s -> 20538.55s]  All right.
[20538.55s -> 20539.35s]  What do you what do you like?
[20539.35s -> 20539.99s]  What are you looking for?
[20540.63s -> 20541.75s]  How about a lasagna?
[20542.31s -> 20543.27s]  Oh you want a candy apple.
[20543.27s -> 20543.51s]  Okay.
[20543.51s -> 20543.83s]  Sure.
[20543.83s -> 20544.15s]  Take it.
[20546.25s -> 20546.89s]  That's what they wanted.
[20546.89s -> 20548.73s]  I need it.
[20550.68s -> 20552.71s]  Okay.
[20552.71s -> 20553.51s]  All right.
[20553.51s -> 20553.83s]  All right.
[20553.83s -> 20554.39s]  I think that's it.
[20555.13s -> 20555.69s]  I think that's it.
[20556.33s -> 20556.83s]  Okay.
[20557.53s -> 20558.94s]  Do one more evolution.
[20559.66s -> 20564.41s]  Tipsy and brunch.
[20564.41s -> 20567.24s]  I don't think brunch is old enough.
[20567.24s -> 20569.08s]  Brunch is not old enough.
[20569.08s -> 20570.38s]  Not yet.
[20570.94s -> 20573.61s]  One more.
[20573.61s -> 20574.09s]  All right.
[20574.09s -> 20576.17s]  When we'll do brunch and tipsy.
[20576.17s -> 20581.77s]  I'll let I'll do that happen before I go.
[20581.77s -> 20586.17s]  The next stream we're going to do a Mon Bazao which is like a car game.
[20586.97s -> 20590.52s]  It's kind of like my summer car and long drive combined.
[20592.66s -> 20594.34s]  I can't tell you we're doing that tomorrow though
[20594.34s -> 20598.76s]  because I think I'm going to take a day to figure out what's going on here.
[20598.76s -> 20602.70s]  That's a car game.
[20605.75s -> 20607.03s]  You come here.
[20607.03s -> 20611.24s]  I might be sick.
[20611.24s -> 20612.68s]  Well if I'm sick then uh then I'm sick.
[20612.68s -> 20613.00s]  Whatever.
[20613.00s -> 20618.38s]  I'll figure it out.
[20618.38s -> 20619.02s]  I'll figure it out.
[20623.02s -> 20624.54s]  I don't think that's the case.
[20624.54s -> 20626.54s]  I think it's like some kind of environmental change or something.
[20626.54s -> 20626.86s]  I don't know.
[20626.86s -> 20630.02s]  I gotta see what happens tomorrow.
[20630.58s -> 20633.77s]  Oh a picket fence.
[20633.77s -> 20635.29s]  We're just hanging out in here.
[20638.90s -> 20639.78s]  Tipsy needs food.
[20639.78s -> 20640.42s]  I'll bring something.
[20640.98s -> 20642.74s]  What is tipsy's favorite food?
[20642.74s -> 20643.72s]  Because I'm going to bring it.
[20646.78s -> 20662.33s]  It's definitely like a pancake or something.
[20662.33s -> 20664.25s]  Oh shit they dug they dug some more.
[20664.25s -> 20665.05s]  Cool.
[20665.05s -> 20667.06s]  All right tipsy come on up.
[20667.78s -> 20668.58s]  I didn't want to do that.
[20668.58s -> 20669.06s]  I'm sorry.
[20669.70s -> 20670.58s]  How do I get you to come out?
[20675.80s -> 20685.64s]  No fuck I didn't I didn't I'm not I didn't mean to do that.
[20685.64s -> 20688.55s]  Oh here we go here we go.
[20688.55s -> 20692.38s]  This is um we have some mutations here.
[20717.99s -> 20719.35s]  I need tipsy to come out.
[20719.35s -> 20723.72s]  See can you come out please?
[20723.72s -> 20732.28s]  Come on up.
[20732.28s -> 20733.48s]  Oh my god.
[20733.48s -> 20735.16s]  I need a lasagna instead.
[20735.16s -> 20743.35s]  There you go.
[20744.23s -> 20749.48s]  Stop.
[20750.28s -> 20777.30s]  Eat this pancake.
[20777.30s -> 20789.10s]  Can you not eat the pancake?
[20789.10s -> 20791.02s]  Get out of the zero gravity room.
[20793.22s -> 20824.18s]  Okay now you need to go to sleep right now.
[20824.18s -> 20824.82s]  Very cool.
[20824.82s -> 20825.54s]  Let's see what we got.
[20827.38s -> 20831.70s]  Do the voice before your throat explodes.
[20831.70s -> 20832.34s]  What voice?
[20832.34s -> 20840.36s]  Head got a little bigger.
[20840.36s -> 20849.29s]  Probably good for balance.
[20849.29s -> 20854.62s]  Ooh the spots change.
[20854.62s -> 20861.86s]  The spots look like look different.
[20861.86s -> 20865.54s]  TikTok voice.
[20865.54s -> 20867.38s]  You want me to do the TikTok voice again?
[20877.98s -> 20882.98s]  Do the Coachella voice.
[20882.98s -> 20883.78s]  That's cool.
[20883.78s -> 20890.42s]  Is that good for your throat though?
[20890.42s -> 20894.10s]  Um it's kind of like going in and out if you noticed.
[20894.10s -> 20900.97s]  It's like sometimes it's like and then sometimes it's like it's okay.
[20900.97s -> 20906.25s]  Bigger head and more metallic.
[20906.25s -> 20914.84s]  I don't notice the metallic though.
[20914.84s -> 20916.36s]  Tipsy's body got short again.
[20916.36s -> 20916.92s]  What?
[20916.92s -> 20924.22s]  Oh no it did.
[20924.22s -> 20925.85s]  What happened?
[20925.85s -> 20926.57s]  What happened?
[20926.57s -> 20929.50s]  What happened?
[20929.50s -> 20931.03s]  What the heck?
[20931.03s -> 20931.91s]  What the f-
[20931.91s -> 20937.18s]  Really?
[20937.18s -> 20944.22s]  What happened there?
[20944.22s -> 20945.66s]  Uh Tipsy and-
[20945.66s -> 20946.84s]  Not Snoopy.
[20946.84s -> 20947.48s]  Who was it?
[20947.48s -> 20949.42s]  Who is it?
[20950.14s -> 20950.94s]  Who was it?
[20950.94s -> 20953.06s]  Oh they're not old enough.
[20953.06s -> 20960.23s]  They're not old enough yet.
[20960.23s -> 20960.79s]  It wasn't-
[20960.79s -> 20961.51s]  No it wasn't Proto.
[20961.51s -> 20962.63s]  It was one of the spots.
[20962.63s -> 20963.43s]  It was one of these.
[20963.43s -> 20965.11s]  It's Brunch.
[20965.11s -> 20966.84s]  Not old enough.
[20966.84s -> 20974.68s]  Oh no Tipsy's a wedge again.
[20974.68s -> 20981.03s]  Uh what's going on with the nose?
[20981.03s -> 20990.82s]  Did Tipsy's head get bigger?
[20990.82s -> 21006.73s]  I think Tipsy's head is bigger.
[21006.73s -> 21008.66s]  Okay all right.
[21009.30s -> 21011.75s]  I'm gonna save it here in case I play again.
[21011.75s -> 21012.55s]  That was fun.
[21012.55s -> 21013.51s]  That was really cute.
[21013.51s -> 21014.97s]  I was a big fan.
[21019.19s -> 21024.41s]  This is how-
[21024.41s -> 21025.37s]  I'm definitely gonna save this
[21025.37s -> 21026.65s]  because I don't know I might play again.
[21026.65s -> 21030.46s]  Although I said that about everything.
[21034.73s -> 21036.49s]  I did not think I was gonna play this for six hours
[21036.49s -> 21039.13s]  but that was really cool.
[21039.13s -> 21040.73s]  I'm supposed to stream tomorrow
[21040.73s -> 21042.94s]  but I-
[21042.94s -> 21043.58s]  I don't know.
[21043.58s -> 21044.14s]  I might not.
[21045.27s -> 21049.16s]  So tentatively I would just say
[21049.16s -> 21051.32s]  prepare for today's Tuesday.
[21051.32s -> 21055.42s]  I just prepare for uh prepare for Thursday
[21055.42s -> 21058.38s]  and if tomorrow I get up and I'm fine
[21058.38s -> 21059.02s]  I'll just go tomorrow.
[21060.47s -> 21062.15s]  But if not then we'll go on Thursday.
[21062.71s -> 21064.34s]  So just plan for Thursday
[21064.34s -> 21065.06s]  but don't-
[21065.06s -> 21068.18s]  Don't be surprised if you see me tomorrow.
[21068.18s -> 21071.83s]  This is really fun.
[21071.83s -> 21072.63s]  This is a really cool game.
[21074.47s -> 21079.42s]  I'm-
[21079.42s -> 21080.78s]  I hope I'm not getting sick.
[21080.78s -> 21081.58s]  I really hope not.
[21082.95s -> 21083.83s]  So see you Friday.
[21083.83s -> 21084.63s]  So see you Saturday.
[21084.63s -> 21085.59s]  No that-
[21085.59s -> 21086.55s]  I don't know yet.
[21086.55s -> 21087.83s]  I don't know yet.
[21087.83s -> 21090.47s]  Can we get a fit check?
[21092.38s -> 21094.06s]  Checking out my Coachella fit check.
[21097.35s -> 21098.31s]  What do you guys think?
[21099.26s -> 21100.30s]  I think it's at least-
[21101.10s -> 21102.54s]  At least a five out of five.
[21110.33s -> 21110.97s]  Stay healthy?
[21110.97s -> 21111.61s]  I'm- I am.
[21111.61s -> 21111.93s]  Don't worry.
[21111.93s -> 21114.34s]  I'll be okay.
[21114.34s -> 21115.22s]  Please stop that.
[21117.06s -> 21117.94s]  See you in July.
[21117.94s -> 21118.34s]  I'm not-
[21118.34s -> 21118.74s]  I hope-
[21118.74s -> 21120.02s]  No I will see you in July.
[21120.02s -> 21120.50s]  You're right.
[21120.50s -> 21121.86s]  Because uh July 14th.
[21122.42s -> 21124.50s]  Make sure you check out on July 14th.
[21125.06s -> 21128.04s]  July 14th is gonna be the baseball stream.
[21128.04s -> 21129.64s]  You're not gonna wanna miss it.
[21129.64s -> 21131.54s]  Trust me on that.
[21131.54s -> 21133.30s]  Gonna have all kinds of festivities.
[21133.30s -> 21135.74s]  All kinds of cool stuff.
[21135.74s -> 21137.58s]  You're not gonna wanna miss it.
[21137.58s -> 21138.14s]  Trust me.
[21141.43s -> 21142.79s]  And I'm telling you.
[21142.79s -> 21144.70s]  Take a burrito.
[21144.70s -> 21146.38s]  Put cheese on top of it.
[21146.38s -> 21148.30s]  And wrap it in another burrito.
[21148.30s -> 21155.13s]  Boston.
[21155.13s -> 21160.30s]  See you later.
[21160.30s -> 21161.02s]  Oh what's that?
[21161.02s -> 21162.06s]  Oh how many-
[21162.06s -> 21163.66s]  How many minus twos do I see?
[21163.66s -> 21165.06s]  Huh?
[21165.06s -> 21166.10s]  Oh hold on a minute there.
[21166.10s -> 21166.82s]  I can't really-
[21166.82s -> 21167.86s]  I can't really see that well.
[21177.43s -> 21178.23s]  Yeah I'll-
[21178.23s -> 21179.03s]  Playing for Thursday.
[21179.03s -> 21180.47s]  I'll see you maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
[21180.47s -> 21182.31s]  Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
[21182.31s -> 21186.23s]  Alright goodnight guys.
[21186.23s -> 21186.55s]  Been fun.
[21186.55s -> 21187.59s]  This game is actually really cool.
[21187.59s -> 21188.55s]  I recommend it.
[21188.55s -> 21189.75s]  If you haven't played it I recommend it.
[21189.75s -> 21190.39s]  Go check it out.
[21193.88s -> 21194.44s]  Minus two.
[21194.44s -> 21195.32s]  Quiet old man.
[21195.96s -> 21199.32s]  I feel like I'm playing Sekiro again.
[21199.32s -> 21201.72s]  Remember Sekiro?
[21201.72s -> 21203.48s]  If you go watch the Sekiro VODs like my-
[21203.48s -> 21205.48s]  The whole time I was playing Sekiro I sounded like this.
[21206.68s -> 21207.64s]  Actually way worse than this.
[21207.64s -> 21208.44s]  Like a hundred times worse.
[21211.43s -> 21212.79s]  Alright I'll see you guys later.
[21212.79s -> 21224.58s]  It's been a long time since I've been like quote sick on stream.
[21224.58s -> 21225.70s]  It's been a very long time.
[21226.26s -> 21231.86s]  It's been at least a couple of-
[21231.86s -> 21233.70s]  I think that's the last time that happened.
[21234.34s -> 21242.07s]  I hate getting sick.
[21242.07s -> 21242.55s]  I hate it.
[21242.55s -> 21243.43s]  I hope it's not happening.
[21243.43s -> 21244.15s]  I gotta stop yelling.
[21244.15s -> 21244.71s]  No more yelling.
[21246.15s -> 21249.67s]  Hope your TikTok voice doesn't get worse.
[21249.67s -> 21250.55s]  So thanks for the stream.
[21250.55s -> 21251.99s]  Yeah thanks for watching.
[21251.99s -> 21254.97s]  Take care of yourselves.
[21254.97s -> 21257.05s]  Have a good rest of your kind of mid-week here.
[21263.37s -> 21266.41s]  Has it gotten worse or has it been about exactly the same since the stream started?
[21266.41s -> 21267.53s]  It's kind of hard to tell.
[21267.53s -> 21270.17s]  I feel like it's kind of going in and out.
[21270.17s -> 21274.28s]  I feel like it's fine but not.
[21274.28s -> 21274.76s]  Is it worse?
[21279.70s -> 21288.94s]  Yeah well.
[21288.94s -> 21293.64s]  I'll shut up.
[21293.64s -> 21294.52s]  I will shut up.
[21295.16s -> 21301.59s]  Drink some water.
[21301.59s -> 21302.31s]  I'll drink some water.
[21307.34s -> 21308.62s]  You need to keep talking.
[21316.44s -> 21317.16s]  Let's do a raid.
[21318.28s -> 21319.40s]  Let's raid.
[21319.40s -> 21319.88s]  Let's see.
[21323.50s -> 21324.14s]  Let's raid.
[21324.14s -> 21325.69s]  Let's raid Atriarch.
[21325.69s -> 21327.69s]  It's Atriarch's birthday today.
[21327.69s -> 21331.18s]  I just figured that out right now because I saw it right here.
[21331.18s -> 21334.36s]  Happy birthday to Atriarch.
[21334.36s -> 21335.56s]  It's Atriarch's birthday.
[21335.56s -> 21337.32s]  I want you to go say happy birthday.
[21337.32s -> 21340.42s]  I'm gonna be fucking pissed.
[21348.84s -> 21350.28s]  Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[21350.28s -> 21350.76s]  Goodbye.
[21350.76s -> 21353.18s]  Sorry that the wrote stuff is annoying.
[21354.30s -> 21356.98s]  I probably sounded irritating this whole time.
[21356.98s -> 21357.62s]  I can imagine.
[21359.00s -> 21359.88s]  But we'll see you soon.
[21359.88s -> 21361.00s]  In the next day or two.
[21361.00s -> 21361.72s]  Have a great night.
[21362.36s -> 21364.60s]  Go say happy birthday to Atriarch.
[21371.43s -> 21471.83s]  And good night.
