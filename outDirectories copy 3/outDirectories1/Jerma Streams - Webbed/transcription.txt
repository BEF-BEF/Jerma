[2.30s -> 24.12s]  Hey, I thought you were retiring. Not right now. Late. Hey! He's gonna delay his retirement.
[24.12s -> 33.82s]  What are you, what are you, why are you saying that? What's going on? Yeah, I am very early.
[36.81s -> 45.29s]  I'm so early, in fact, that I am almost a full day early. I'm one day early. We've got some good news
[46.01s -> 53.27s]  for all of you, uh, audio Andes that hate everything about my mic setup and my audio setup.
[53.91s -> 66.68s]  Good news for you. My entire audio setup is changing as of after this stream. I'm gonna have
[67.48s -> 77.88s]  hopefully a really, really crystal clean sound as of next stream. Maybe. Depends on when I want to
[77.88s -> 94.36s]  get some of this stuff. I mean, speaking of mics, hold on. I said you already have a Newman. What
[94.36s -> 104.70s]  could you improve? Um, I like, okay, I like the go XLR, but I don't, I don't know, I don't like
[104.70s -> 113.35s]  the way that it makes my mic sound. I've tried so many settings with this thing. The product is,
[113.35s -> 119.85s]  it's an all encompassing product, right? You plug in an XLR mic, you have complete control,
[119.85s -> 127.30s]  you can do funny sound effects, you can do voice changing. It's very easy to use software. But every
[127.30s -> 134.31s]  time I change a setting on it, I feel like it makes it sound worse. I'm going to try a few things.
[134.95s -> 150.66s]  I'm going to try this mic with a new compressor, see how that sounds. I'm going to try maybe a
[150.66s -> 156.10s]  different mic setup, a different way, a different positioning of the mic, a different boom arm.
[156.82s -> 162.94s]  I'm going to try a few things, but how are you going to do funny voice effects? I don't worry.
[163.58s -> 166.92s]  I might still use the go XLR. I might actually still plug it in and use it.
[167.56s -> 176.33s]  Please address this title. It sucks. Just being a bug. I'm just being a bug. I'm early being a bug.
[177.05s -> 184.90s]  Spiders aren't bugs, you nerd. Yes, they are. A spider is a bug. It's a bug. What do you want to
[184.90s -> 194.84s]  say? It's a, it's not a bug. A spider is a bug. Yes, it is. I'm a bug is a bug. I know it's a
[194.84s -> 202.84s]  crustacean. It's a, it's a crab was a small crab with extra legs. Whatever. It's a bug. It's the
[202.92s -> 208.36s]  thing that crawls on your wall and it bites you and it has got poison in it and it will poison
[208.36s -> 216.81s]  you if it fucking touches you. Some of them. Spiders are bugs, but they're not insects. Yeah,
[217.29s -> 228.58s]  thank you. Appreciate that. Hurry up and play this stupid game. I can only watch for 15 minutes.
[229.46s -> 241.30s]  Dude, the game is only four hours long and you should know this by now. The first 15 minutes
[241.30s -> 248.07s]  of every one of my streams are awful. It's me explaining to you a dream I had or how much
[248.07s -> 252.73s]  Dunkin Donuts went downhill or how I forgot to drink water and I'll be right back again.
[252.73s -> 256.17s]  Now for the first, the first 15 minutes is a warm up, man. Let's be like that every time.
[256.81s -> 266.46s]  You said Thursday. I know. Yeah, I'm full of surprises. I did say Thursday, although the
[266.46s -> 273.53s]  reason why I'm here now and starting very late is because I have to take Otto to the vet. He's um,
[274.25s -> 288.02s]  some things I want to get checked out. He's okay. I think he's fine. Is he okay? I think he's going
[288.02s -> 296.39s]  to be 100% fine. He just might. He's having the same kind of, I don't know, he's, he's peeing a
[296.39s -> 302.97s]  lot. I think he's been prone to getting UTIs. He's had it a couple times. He's had a UTI a couple
[302.97s -> 312.95s]  times over the last five to 10 years. I feel like this is starting a new one. So I'm just going to
[312.95s -> 323.51s]  go get it checked out, see if he's okay. He actually had blood work done a couple months ago,
[323.51s -> 326.39s]  less than a month, like a month ago and it was fine. He was, it was all normal.
[327.03s -> 333.37s]  So I wonder if this is something just brand new, but we'll see. He's fine. He's happy. He's just,
[334.09s -> 337.37s]  it needs to be addressed, needs to be looked into. So I decided, you know what,
[338.01s -> 344.47s]  if I'm going to take him probably tomorrow, then I going to stream today. So I'm going to be taking
[344.47s -> 360.81s]  him to the vet tomorrow. You're a good dog, dad. I, he's, he's like the best. Everybody, everybody's
[360.81s -> 370.89s]  a good dog, dad. Okay. There are personal, there are like personal best friends. That's how I see
[370.89s -> 374.09s]  Otto. Otto's just like a, he's just, he's just best friend. It's just that, there you go. There's
[374.09s -> 382.90s]  my, there's what he is. True. Yeah. Everybody's dog is their best friend. And I don't believe
[382.90s -> 394.92s]  anybody that says otherwise. Does it in the goddamn title. But you can have human best friends and
[394.92s -> 411.37s]  dog best friends. Otto is my BFF. But yeah, I, there's two things for you to know. Next stream,
[411.37s -> 416.71s]  I'm going to sound completely different. I am going to be doing some audio testing for the next
[416.71s -> 422.70s]  few streams. We'll find a good place where I sound good. I might even use the same setup. I'm just
[422.70s -> 430.58s]  going to change a bunch of settings, but I'm getting some new equipment. Jeremy, you're
[430.58s -> 436.50s]  fucked in the head. Not going to lie. That talked about my dog being my like BFF.
[441.32s -> 447.03s]  I don't think anything I said was too outrageous right there. I feel like everything I just said
[448.42s -> 455.62s]  was very, very plain, normal, and, and very expected. That wasn't too crazy, right? I don't
[455.62s -> 461.16s]  think so. All right. So here's what we're doing. I was going to play house flipper pets DLC, which
[461.16s -> 470.20s]  I mean, we're talking about dogs, you know, cats and gerbils and rabbits and bugs. If you have them
[471.56s -> 476.68s]  but that's not what we're doing today because I'm starting so late. This is an impromptu early
[476.68s -> 483.75s]  reverse delay stream. We're going to play webbed, which we were just talking about bugs. So webbed
[483.75s -> 490.50s]  is a game where you play as a spider and spider around. And that's what we're going to do. So
[490.50s -> 498.74s]  nothing tomorrow. As I take auto to the vet for the impromptu schedule change, but here we are,
[499.46s -> 510.07s]  we're just going to spider around. So the plan, the game plan is there is as follows. Are you
[510.07s -> 523.26s]  listening? Listen up. This is a listen up engine house flipper pets. DLC is going to be Saturday
[523.26s -> 529.34s]  and Sunday because during that same period we're going to play wad blood wash and murder house.
[529.98s -> 535.40s]  So this weekend we're going to do pets, DLC, murder house and blood wash. I'm not sure which
[535.40s -> 548.36s]  day they could flip back and forth. It's the plan going forward here. Oh brother, this guy stinks.
[551.16s -> 558.98s]  What was that? If you had a movie made about you, who would play you?
[559.94s -> 576.95s]  Me. Is that really a question? Me. I would play me. But did you mean, because I'm 36,
[578.87s -> 583.83s]  what, what time period does this movie take place? When I'm older, when I'm still young,
[584.39s -> 589.94s]  younger, what, what is this movie about? Cause everyone's saying, oh, what it would be Willem
[589.94s -> 596.71s]  Defoe. But Willem Defoe is a lot older than me. Five years from now in the future. Um,
[597.35s -> 611.42s]  can it be Steve Buscemi? I can see it. I am still young. I'm young. I'm still, I'm still young.
[611.42s -> 620.38s]  I mean, when I turned, I think when I turned 38 is when I'm just going to be able to say, I can't,
[620.38s -> 628.42s]  I'm not young anymore. Although I did fall out of the 18 to 34 bracket, drop down bracket for how
[628.42s -> 642.02s]  old you are. That's true. Old is 46. I think old is 40. Old is definitely 40. It's 40. You can't
[642.02s -> 648.02s]  say you're, I'm young. Oh yeah. I'm just a young guy when you're 40. That doesn't, no, you're 40.
[650.14s -> 660.02s]  I think 30. Uh, I think 40 is the new 30 though. People are living a lot longer. So I look, I mean,
[660.02s -> 675.69s]  people are living to be like in their nineties. Aren't you 46? I'm 36. Aren't you 40? Um, no,
[675.69s -> 692.01s]  I'm, I'm almost 40 is midlife crisis, midlife. No, it's not. Is it? Yeah, it is. But okay. But
[692.01s -> 696.41s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You guys can't tell me that I, if I, when I turned 40,
[696.41s -> 701.45s]  you guys can't tell me I'm having a midlife crisis. If I act like a weirdo or if I do something
[701.45s -> 707.30s]  strange, I've been having, I've been doing that old kind of strange shit since I was
[707.30s -> 713.62s]  working in my twenties. Right. But you guys can't say, Oh dude, look at him. He's being so weird.
[713.62s -> 720.30s]  He's having a, he's having a midlife crisis. I did that stuff like 10 years ago too. Right.
[720.30s -> 724.92s]  I'm just, that's just who I am at this point. But don't say that. We make me feel incredibly
[724.92s -> 736.44s]  poorly. 36 plus 36 is 72. Yeah. And people are living to be a hundred. People are living
[736.44s -> 752.58s]  to be a hundred. 50 is midlife crisis. All right. You guys ready to play? Let's, let's play. This
[752.58s -> 762.01s]  is webbed. The game is called webbed. It looks great. It looks pretty cute. Is this a controller
[762.01s -> 767.18s]  game or should I play with my hands? Is this a hands game or is it, well, you don't have any
[767.18s -> 773.02s]  mouse. Should I play with my hand or should I use my thumbs? That's what I'm trying to say.
[773.02s -> 787.11s]  Hands or thumbs? I think this is a hands game because you have to aim. That's a kind of scary
[787.11s -> 795.05s]  sound. It reminds me of, okay, you know when a hummingbird flies next to your head and you
[795.05s -> 802.84s]  feel like it's a gigantic, huge, scary insect and you go, Oh, you freak out, you scream and you've
[802.84s -> 807.67s]  run and you kind of move your hands around. And then afterwards you realize that you were blessed
[807.67s -> 817.14s]  by a hummingbird and you go, Oh no, come back. I'll stand still. Like, no, it's already gone, man.
[817.14s -> 831.22s]  You fucked it up. This is what you want. Want this? That doesn't happen. This does. Base cam Andy.
[831.86s -> 840.87s]  I want you to crank your compressor up as high as it will go and do one radio host joke next stream,
[840.87s -> 850.36s]  please. Maybe. You've changed. Yeah. I'm sure I have. You guys have, you guys have seen me go from
[850.36s -> 857.37s]  a guy in his early to mid twenties to a guy in his mid to late thirties. Of course, you've seen it
[857.37s -> 860.90s]  in real time. Some of you guys that have been here for 10 years, 12 years, you of course have
[860.90s -> 867.61s]  to change probably. Hopefully for the better. I hope for the better. I've changed physically.
[867.61s -> 874.17s]  I've changed probably a little bit mentally. What are you talking about? 12 years have gone by.
[874.17s -> 885.82s]  You're a young man. You've changed. You look chiseled. No, I don't. No, I really don't actually
[885.82s -> 895.51s]  today. I'm not even any. No, I do not. Chiseled. Are you guys? No, I don't. I'm looking at it.
[895.51s -> 902.78s]  I'm looking at it right now. I'm looking at the screen over here. No, I don't. I look kind of,
[903.34s -> 911.05s]  I look like clay. Can you chisel clay? I don't think so. Yeah, you can after you cook it.
[911.61s -> 924.42s]  That's not a zit. What is that? What is that? It's like a clump of hairs. What is this? What
[924.50s -> 933.43s]  is that? Did I not shave there somehow last time? What is that? I have no idea what that is.
[933.43s -> 944.84s]  Do you know what I'm talking about? You have dents. Yeah, I do have a couple. Yeah, I do have a
[944.84s -> 954.17s]  couple of head dents. I do have dents in my head. Whatever. When you get to be 30, you don't give
[954.17s -> 964.22s]  shit about a head dents. Who cares? I don't care about a head dent. I'm too old. I, guys, I used
[964.22s -> 971.72s]  to 10 years ago, I'd be in the mirror and I'd, every, every, I would sit there for 10 straight
[971.72s -> 984.23s]  minutes and just be like, I don't, I don't fucking care anymore. Like I care, I care enough. I care
[984.23s -> 987.59s]  enough to, I don't want to look like shit every day, right? But I mean, I'm not sitting in the
[987.59s -> 997.45s]  mirror parting individual strands of hair. I mean, this is just what I look like. And then for 40,
[997.45s -> 1002.31s]  I look pretty damn good for 40. I'm sorry. You have to give yourself a little bit of credit
[1002.31s -> 1008.89s]  sometimes. I look pretty fucking good for 40. I think I've been drinking a lot of green tea.
[1008.89s -> 1026.06s]  I've been drinking a lot of, excuse me, water. No tea today because I ran out. I drink it so much
[1026.70s -> 1039.78s]  that there's no more. I didn't get any more. Play the game. I'm just, it's been 10 minutes, man.
[1039.78s -> 1049.38s]  Stalling. I'm, yeah, I'm just, I'm just hanging out. You guys can chill. Just chill for a second.
[1049.38s -> 1054.73s]  How did you run out of tea? Because I drink, I drink so much of it. I've been drinking,
[1054.73s -> 1062.63s]  I've been trying a bunch of things. Got a few that I really like. I have these like green tea,
[1062.63s -> 1069.05s]  like energy packets. I've got green tea powder. I've got, dude, I'm going to have green tea
[1069.05s -> 1076.22s]  souvenir merchandise and shit eventually. And then I take care of my skin too. Moisturize.
[1076.22s -> 1082.42s]  Developers like to acknowledge the Shigera, Turbul, and Gooby Gooby peoples as the traditional
[1082.42s -> 1094.76s]  owners of the lands on which webs is based on. Holy shit. What the hell is that? That feels kind
[1094.76s -> 1115.21s]  of good to do that. Hold Q to dance. Okay. Space is jump. Hold that to grapple to a point. Oh shit.
[1115.21s -> 1134.34s]  Okay. That's kind of fun. Can I descend down? Okay. Let's keep going. Aim at a point and hold
[1134.90s -> 1143.26s]  right click to go to, to start spinning a web. Now aim at a second point and release to build a bridge.
[1143.90s -> 1165.53s]  Wait, what? Whoa. Okay. Oh, you can connect them. Spin. I can spin a web. All right. Why are you,
[1165.53s -> 1170.49s]  why is Jared Leto playing web? I don't look anything like Jared Leto, like at all.
[1171.05s -> 1179.67s]  It's zero. It is zero resemblance. Zero. If you put both of our faces in a scanning machine,
[1179.67s -> 1184.63s]  we would have a like fucking 12% compatibility. Okay. That's cool. I don't know what you're
[1184.63s -> 1193.38s]  talking about. What happened? Okay. So we got to go like this. Oh, this is mud. Can I not grab mud
[1194.34s -> 1206.68s]  from here to here? Is this like Jump King? Am I going to get mad at this game? I'm probably,
[1206.68s -> 1211.16s]  I'm going to be pissed this game, right? Is this game that's going to piss me off?
[1223.80s -> 1264.41s]  12%. Holy shit. Shoot lasers? Okay. That's weird. Oh no. Why do I have lasers? What? Okay. Well,
[1264.41s -> 1272.10s]  that's kind of cool. I've Hey buddy. I'm so sorry. I saw it happen to your boyfriend.
[1272.10s -> 1279.78s]  That big mean bird has been menacing the land below its sky. Bower for years. It devoured
[1279.78s -> 1285.93s]  many of my siblings, but I think it has something else in mind for your bow. The bird loves to
[1285.93s -> 1290.57s]  collect blue gems, you see. And that love of yours is the shiniest blue I've ever seen.
[1291.53s -> 1302.30s]  Come by my old nest little buddy. I might have an idea. Okay. So this big ball of silk may not look
[1302.30s -> 1307.34s]  like much, but it was my home for a time. The ants below have approached me with reckless plans to
[1307.34s -> 1312.70s]  turn it into a heated airship. It's part of the defense effort. I've not let them try it so far,
[1312.70s -> 1319.26s]  but perhaps a little recklessness is what we need right now. Anybody else love ants because of the
[1319.82s -> 1325.46s]  Honey I Shrunk the Kids movie? People are like, oh, ants. Gross. Actually, I like ants.
[1326.65s -> 1332.65s]  In Honey I Shrunk the Kids, an ant saves all the kids. It defends them against a giant scorpion.
[1333.85s -> 1338.41s]  It's anti. They're good friends and it protects them. And I remember watching that and going,
[1338.41s -> 1345.16s]  ants are good. I like ants. They're good friends. I like ants because of that. Okay.
[1345.88s -> 1349.48s]  They'll need some fuel too, of course. I've looked to the dung beetles on the hill for that.
[1350.28s -> 1355.24s]  And naturally a guide is important for any adventure. Perhaps a bee. Nobody knows these
[1355.24s -> 1360.87s]  skies better than them. All right. Yes. This is a good plan. Go on little buddy. There's no time
[1360.87s -> 1375.82s]  to waste. Get out there, make some friends and save your love. Movement's clean. Is that fall
[1375.82s -> 1387.40s]  damage? What's that? Can I grab that? What is it? I found, I got a little spider friend.
[1388.28s -> 1396.09s]  All right. Okay. I gotta go get to the, go to the ants. Oh, what happens if I get more? How many
[1396.09s -> 1413.72s]  of these should I get? Oh shit. Is there fall damage? All right. Okay. It reminds me of worms.
[1416.25s -> 1432.09s]  The ninja rope. Who's that? Oh, I'm giving up my, oh, these are babies. You don't weigh enough for
[1432.09s -> 1438.79s]  fall damage. New Spider-Man game looks pretty good. There's no fall damage. Okay. Thank you so
[1438.79s -> 1443.91s]  much. These little ones have ballooned off when that big bird flew by, but they're far too young
[1443.91s -> 1448.15s]  to be off on their own. If you find the others, please bring them back to me. I like birds.
[1448.15s -> 1458.87s]  I like crows. With 40, I could bring all 40. I like crows. You know that, did you guys know
[1458.87s -> 1472.10s]  that crows are the most intelligent fucking animal? Did you guys know that? Okay. I need to
[1472.10s -> 1484.07s]  find an ant. Can't get up there. Is this like a metroidvania? Do I have to go get like boots
[1484.07s -> 1505.85s]  or something? I really do like the movement a lot though. It's fun. Where are these ants? Who asked,
[1505.85s -> 1514.55s]  nerd? Fuck. Who is that? Okay. There was a, okay. I gotta get over there. There's a fly over there.
[1515.11s -> 1539.58s]  I heckin' love small spiders. Stop. Whatever. Okay. I gotta get up here. So that fly is over
[1539.58s -> 1557.54s]  there. Can I like, like this? Oh shit. Okay. Oh. Ah, all right. That's how you, that's what I'm
[1557.54s -> 1586.01s]  supposed to do. No! What are you doing? Fuck. Okay. Get back up here. So if I go from here,
[1586.65s -> 1593.86s]  you should be right here. Oh, I got it. There we go. All right. What do you, what do you want?
[1594.66s -> 1601.70s]  Guild Predator, I am the Fly Lord. Your fangs are too small to devour me. If my kin don't sit well
[1601.70s -> 1608.95s]  in your stomach, come pay me a visit. Let's see what we can do about that. You haven't eaten even
[1608.95s -> 1614.39s]  a single fly? Perhaps I judged you too harshly. Get on your way, spider, and stay away from temptation.
[1616.20s -> 1638.34s]  Platformer Andy? What's up here? Oh. This is back where I was. This is where the,
[1638.34s -> 1648.42s]  all right. Get back over here. Tab for map? What the fuck? Okay. I'm in, I'm at the,
[1648.42s -> 1652.87s]  okay. I gotta go down there to go to the ant world. How do I get, how do I go there?
[1652.87s -> 1674.66s]  Where is it? Jumping spiders. I hecking love jumping spiders. Oh, here we go. All right. I got
[1674.66s -> 1681.50s]  it. Ant kingdom. Greetings, comrade spider. I hear you've got some problems that could use an ant
[1681.50s -> 1687.80s]  solution. We'd love to help out, but we're still recovering from the latest fire ant raid. The
[1687.80s -> 1692.60s]  workers could really use some extra help down there if you've got time. All right. Speak with comrade
[1692.68s -> 1712.87s]  Carl in the mech ant chamber. Be able to give you some work. Okay. Turn that on. What's this?
[1716.12s -> 1726.66s]  Can I dig? Hey, can spiders dig? Okay. What's the job? Help with the elevator. It's been broken
[1726.66s -> 1730.42s]  down since the attack, but I can't reach the part we need to fix it. If you can get me the brass
[1730.42s -> 1735.14s]  cog from the other side of this chamber, we should be able to get it running. Without that elevator,
[1735.14s -> 1745.05s]  we're stuck up here. All right. Fix the elevator. Fucking easy. All right. This is where you start
[1745.05s -> 1767.00s]  to die. Easy. Okay. I didn't know you could die in the game. What was that? Grubs? Oh,
[1769.59s -> 1789.14s]  I was supposed to do a huge cog. Hold on. Cog is right there. Oh, I actually have to drag it across.
[1789.14s -> 1807.13s]  Oh, that sucks. All right. Hold on. Should I go down the secret? All right. Stay down there for a
[1807.13s -> 1814.57s]  minute. Should I go do the secret? What if I get stuck down here? Oh, it's just a grub. Okay. Cool.
[1817.43s -> 1833.62s]  I like this game. It's pretty cool. So far. So far. Hold on. Relax. So far. Can I go in the acid?
[1834.42s -> 1853.14s]  Yeah, I just can't. Oh, shit. Hold on. There you go. Thanks. I'll deliver the cog back to the main
[1853.14s -> 1870.46s]  shaft. Just pop it into the gearbox and we should be good. Do I have to do that? What? Do I have to
[1870.46s -> 1875.19s]  do anything? I demand to know what your favorite soup is. Ah, fucking cream of broccoli or something,
[1875.19s -> 1911.50s]  man. Like everybody else. Hold on. Did you go like this? Fuck you. There you go. He's going
[1911.50s -> 1923.82s]  to rage. I'm probably won't. This game's too cute to be mad at. It's way too cute. Although I say
[1923.82s -> 1931.75s]  that now, something's going to happen. All right. So who do I give those to? This is a cute game.
[1937.30s -> 1945.48s]  What are you doing? I'm playing. I don't know what I was going to say. Up. I'm playing up.
[1945.72s -> 1952.22s]  Like the movie up. I've never seen up. I just know that there's an old guy and there's a dog
[1952.22s -> 1960.71s]  and there are balloons. I don't know anything about this movie. I've never seen it. But, you know,
[1960.71s -> 1966.17s]  I feel like I've seen the movie though, right? The problem with really popular movies that you
[1966.17s -> 1970.89s]  haven't seen is it's almost like you feel like you've seen the entire movie because everybody's
[1970.89s -> 1985.77s]  talked about every scene. So I feel like I've seen it already. I go down here. Watch it now.
[1985.77s -> 2005.50s]  You would like it. I know I would. I just, I feel like I've already seen it. What is this for? Hold
[2005.50s -> 2013.16s]  on. You should be arrested because you haven't seen it. I don't think seeing, not seeing up is
[2013.16s -> 2019.91s]  as outrageous as not seeing Star Wars or something or Lord of the Rings. I know I've never seen the
[2019.91s -> 2027.69s]  Lord of the Rings, but wait, is this a shortcut? That is. What else? Why is there a shortcut?
[2032.14s -> 2034.30s]  You're going to cry. You should watch it with Holly. You're going to cry.
[2040.25s -> 2046.82s]  Comrade Mark, recruit you from the surface. Fantastic. There's tons of work to do. Finish
[2046.82s -> 2051.70s]  the mech ant. Let's see. The mandibles need a final heat treatment up in the forage room.
[2052.90s -> 2059.00s]  About to turn that back on. We need to patch up the pipe works. Okay. We'll need that to supply
[2059.00s -> 2064.60s]  the mech ant. Oh, and it still needs three more legs to be attached. Oh God. I think we're waiting.
[2064.60s -> 2072.20s]  This thing's crushing me. That was bad. It seemed kind of dangerous. I think we're waiting on
[2072.20s -> 2077.38s]  deliveries for two of them from engineering. What are you waiting for comrade? Get to it.
[2078.10s -> 2088.07s]  Okay. So I need to get parts for this. I need mech ant legs, water pipes and propellant pipes
[2088.07s -> 2097.56s]  and mandibles. Where am I supposed to find this shit? What's this? Living quarters. All right. I
[2097.56s -> 2106.34s]  got to find eggs? Where do I shoot somebody with a laser? Oh, here we go. What does this do?
[2108.04s -> 2119.24s]  Oh, all right. That brings it up there. Bunker W. Why? What do you mean Bunker W? What?
[2121.69s -> 2145.38s]  All right. Attach this. How do I attach it? Is this with the mouth? How does this work? How
[2145.38s -> 2150.86s]  do I do this? It looks like a leg. Yeah, it does. But how do I move it? Oh shit. Okay. I have to
[2150.86s -> 2159.27s]  snap it in place. Okay. What? All right. I need two more legs. Is your favorite bug? Um,
[2162.38s -> 2172.26s]  that bait. My favorite bug is probably, I don't know, but I just, I love the ball so much
[2172.26s -> 2190.28s]  and I can't decide. Um, I can't, is it stuck here? Oh yeah. Probably a honeybee. Honeybees are
[2191.08s -> 2198.04s]  probably just fucking distracting me and it's pissing me off. I don't care. You know what?
[2198.52s -> 2208.68s]  Okay. No, it's honeybee. Honeybees are, they make this delicious goo. How would you not like a
[2208.68s -> 2219.34s]  honeybee? I'm not supposed to wedge that out of there. He's so grumpy. No, I'm kidding. I swear
[2219.34s -> 2229.21s]  to God. Earwigs. I don't, I don't, I don't mind earwigs. I think they're fine. How do I get this
[2229.21s -> 2244.60s]  out? Out through there? Earwigs are the worst. They really aren't though. What do they do that's so
[2244.60s -> 2253.16s]  bad? What, what does an earwig do that's so bad? Nothing. They just kind of exist. What's wrong?
[2257.08s -> 2263.00s]  Mosquitoes are probably the worst insect without a doubt. And ticks. Mosquitoes, ticks and fleas
[2263.00s -> 2281.88s]  probably, right? Like this. All the biting insects. Fuck that. Can I not pull this guy out? Yeah,
[2281.88s -> 2286.60s]  mosquitoes are the worst. They don't, there's no benefit at all for a mosquito. They just cause
[2286.68s -> 2303.34s]  problems. They just cause problems only. What about the leech? Yeah, but the leech had some medical
[2305.18s -> 2313.62s]  backing, right? Weren't leeches, didn't they have a purpose? What the fuck? A leech is not a bug
[2313.62s -> 2340.68s]  though. Yeah, that's true. Ah! Okay. Oh my God, there's more. Fuck you, stupid goddamn. All right,
[2340.68s -> 2369.75s]  I'm fine. I'm just trying to rush. I have to stop. Slow down. Oh, come on. So what the hell? How do I
[2369.75s -> 2385.59s]  get? I have to be able to pull these guys out, right? Is there a device I get? Wait. Oh, I got
[2385.59s -> 2417.98s]  one. Is that going to work? Um, how do I get this back? Wait, will this connect in here? Oh shit!
[2417.98s -> 2421.66s]  That's how you do it. All right. So you have to connect them. How am I going to get this back?
[2425.90s -> 2447.45s]  He's so fucking high. How do I get it out? It's getting called out right now. I'm fine.
[2453.66s -> 2481.67s]  Let's drag it out. Come on, pull it up. Yeah. Okay. I need to make a bridge here. I'm good enough.
[2481.67s -> 2498.49s]  So now I have to fuck. How am I supposed to do this? I got to pull it up and then turn it.
[2498.49s -> 2525.45s]  I'm not going to die. Here we go. All right. Now jump it this way. You look confused. I kind
[2525.45s -> 2573.74s]  of am confused. I kind of am confused, man. Heat bugs or riot. No, fuck you. No. Oh, it did. It
[2573.74s -> 2586.92s]  beat it for me. Good. Oh, there's one. Okay. He got it. Okay. So they transfer it. Oh, all right.
[2586.92s -> 2597.59s]  Let me just get a sip of water. How many of you guys with just room temp water out of a glass?
[2598.31s -> 2609.11s]  You can just badlands chugs that and it's not a problem. Room temp water out of a,
[2609.11s -> 2617.91s]  just a room temp glass. That's gone. It's gone instantly. Okay. I need, there's another piece
[2617.91s -> 2621.19s]  over here. There's enough. What was it? What was the other one? Is there more than one here?
[2621.99s -> 2637.13s]  I don't think there's more than one now. That's easy. Ah, that's very helpful actually.
[2638.09s -> 2657.58s]  Okay. So now there's another leg here. I got to connect it to this one. So I get it. Everyone,
[2657.58s -> 2675.88s]  that was Pepe laughing. You're really funny. Just for your information. Webbed is 10 bucks.
[2675.88s -> 2682.50s]  Wait, am I connected? Do I have to connect this one to that one? Is that how this works?
[2683.14s -> 2709.43s]  Is it going to connect to this? Do I have to do that? Well, I have to bring it up there.
[2709.43s -> 2724.22s]  I have to take it to the mech. Where's the mech from here? Up, upright. Come here. Get over here.
[2726.38s -> 2753.98s]  I screwed it up. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no. Get up. Get up. Oh my God. I soft locked it.
[2753.98s -> 2791.19s]  Okay. Now come here. Bugs have milk. I don't think so. Get this fucking thing up. I don't know, man.
[2792.07s -> 2802.98s]  I don't think, no. What are you talking about? Why are you saying such a weird thing? No. Whatever.
[2802.98s -> 2861.83s]  Start over. Just start the whole fucking thing over. Use more than one web. Stop being bad.
[2861.83s -> 2888.52s]  Yeah, but I'm trying to pull it up. I want it to go up more. I want it to go up more. How do I get
[2888.52s -> 2909.06s]  it to go up more? Connect it at both ends. It is on both ends. How do I pull it up? You need more
[2909.06s -> 2926.57s]  lines. No, I don't. Look at how many fucking lines there are. Put them on the ceiling instead.
[2926.57s -> 2962.23s]  Get up here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. But go. This is for you. I think it made it. I think.
[2962.23s -> 2985.22s]  Let's go find out. Eat bugs. Shut up. What is that sound? All right. Look it. We got another leg.
[2986.31s -> 3018.10s]  Guys, we've got another leg. Connect it. Okay. It's one more leg. I have not been down to the lower
[3018.10s -> 3044.82s]  right. Let's figure it out. Can't talk right now. Sorry. Oh, a giant. Can you please be a little
[3044.82s -> 3054.66s]  bit more quiet? You almost woke up my dog. He needs rest. I was supposed to start barking.
[3054.66s -> 3061.66s]  I was about to try to do a real dog bark. Realistic dog barking. You know what I mean?
[3063.22s -> 3079.40s]  Kind of in the realm of. I caught that one really early. I caught that one very early. I like the
[3079.40s -> 3087.62s]  song. Yeah, the soundtrack's cute. Good day, comrade. Everyone here is getting really thirsty.
[3087.62s -> 3107.91s]  Oh, me too. You think you could turn the water back on so we can have a drink? Yeah. Drop this
[3107.91s -> 3121.51s]  somehow. No bark, Andy. How do I turn that on? Jeremy, maybe if you played the game, you just
[3121.51s -> 3128.46s]  would figure it out eventually. Now I have to ask a fake rhetorical question and go like this and
[3128.46s -> 3147.00s]  wait till somebody says the answer. Uh, where am I? I need water. Oh, boss bite. Is it boss bite,
[3147.00s -> 3154.54s]  I think. Look, that's a Mega Man door. That's the Mega Man door before the boss. You know what I'm
[3154.54s -> 3167.88s]  saying? This is a Mega Man boss fight door. I told you it was. I'm always doing a boneless. Get it?
[3167.88s -> 3180.17s]  Hey, you skater girl. Hit me, skate herb. I'm trying to teach all them ants to skate. They
[3180.17s -> 3186.79s]  got the right attitude, but still working on technique. You want to show them how it's done?
[3186.79s -> 3195.26s]  Yes. Heck yes. They're depart ants. We about to see some sick moves.
[3195.26s -> 3203.11s]  Rip board, release board, rip board, release board, rip board, release board, rip board.
[3206.25s -> 3224.97s]  What? W. That was pretty sick. What am I supposed to be doing? Oh, I have to grip the board
[3224.97s -> 3244.38s]  and jump. I don't know. I don't get it. Oh, what a cool trick. What a cool trick that was. Okay.
[3245.34s -> 3261.82s]  Um, I can. Oh, I can grow. I need to be on the board. How do I? Okay. How do I turn? How do I
[3261.82s -> 3305.34s]  restart? I don't know. I have no idea what the board is. Okay. Grip the board. Hold on. Hold on.
[3305.34s -> 3332.10s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's the B. All right. I got the B. I got BB. B. Shit. That was
[3332.10s -> 3341.88s]  going to be cool looking. Can I grab this and put it back up there? There we go. All right. Wait,
[3341.88s -> 3372.86s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. Get over there. I need another B. I need E. God damn it. Oh, this way.
[3373.50s -> 3382.50s]  I see. All right. I got to go this way and then come down there. All right. Check it out. Here we
[3382.50s -> 3400.22s]  go. Come on. What the fuck? Use webs? I can't use webs. It pulls me off the board. Does it? Yeah. I
[3400.22s -> 3431.85s]  can't. If I use a web, it takes me off the board. That was pretty sick. All right. I got to go up.
[3434.10s -> 3453.70s]  I need E. An E and a B and I'm done. My head just caved in. Where's the last B? Right there.
[3454.34s -> 3475.54s]  I wasn't supposed to do this in a certain time limit, was I? Hope not. Hey, skater girl. You're
[3475.54s -> 3493.19s]  ready to skate? No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to skate anymore. I already did it. I can
[3493.19s -> 3501.45s]  just leave? Wait, did I get a skateboard as a present? Where am I? All the way over here.
[3503.67s -> 3513.21s]  I named my dog. Can you please bark back to my dog? No, I'm not going to bark at your dog
[3514.01s -> 3529.67s]  because me barking at your dog is an embarrassment for me. I'm not barking. I'm way too far away. I'm
[3529.67s -> 3539.69s]  going back to the ant kingdom. Is the music too annoying? All right. I need to go. I can't get,
[3539.69s -> 3546.39s]  I got to go up to where the mech is and then right and then down. All right. I think so.
[3546.39s -> 3565.02s]  Will you please just bark, please? Oh my God. Okay. Fine. Is that what you want to hear?
[3565.02s -> 3612.66s]  You want me to just wait? Is that good? The only thing I see is somebody very, very long,
[3612.66s -> 3620.86s]  long term viewer, mod, community members been around for a fucking decade. It's an all lower
[3620.86s -> 3642.76s]  case. Just wrote strange. What does it even sound like? That sounds weird. I did. I actually didn't
[3642.76s -> 3649.24s]  mean to have that on. I kind of want to, I kind of want to keep this on just like this for a little
[3649.24s -> 3657.40s]  while. How does it, how much more different do I actually sound? Do I sound even that much more
[3657.40s -> 3665.51s]  different? How absurdly different do I probably a lot, right? Probably a lot. I would take a quick
[3665.51s -> 3672.26s]  master. I have to play with the audio setup one last time before I get rid of it forever. I can't
[3672.26s -> 3677.38s]  believe I just fucking barked. I'm genuinely unhappy about that. Like why did I do that? What
[3677.38s -> 3683.46s]  was the point? Like I don't know why I did that. It's like 15,000 people here, four of you were
[3683.46s -> 3688.15s]  telling me to bark and you said it like 50 times. And then finally I was like, I thought, I thought
[3688.15s -> 3693.83s]  that you five people were like a thousand people because I keep looking over and seeing, dude,
[3693.83s -> 3698.39s]  you should buy dog likes when dogs bark. Bark at my dog. I'm like, fine. I'll do it. Okay.
[3705.43s -> 3713.10s]  It was not 20%. It was definitely not. I got to go try to go right.
[3715.21s -> 3723.98s]  You can't go right from, I need to go this way. Please, please say Aaron in the deep voice.
[3724.54s -> 3742.42s]  Okay. Was there another leg over here that I didn't get? How do I get out of here? What about up?
[3742.42s -> 3758.38s]  Okay. Please do a pull. No, I, you just got like your fucked up weird fringe guy voice.
[3758.94s -> 3766.34s]  I just did it. I just tried to realistically bark like a dog. No, you're not getting any more.
[3766.34s -> 3770.66s]  That's what you're getting. That's what you're getting. That's what you're getting today.
[3775.37s -> 3782.20s]  No more. Okay. Wait, I need to get water, right? Okay. Water pump is down.
[3782.76s -> 3787.94s]  Helmet pump is over there and the pump power station. All right, let's go down.
[3787.94s -> 3907.74s]  Shit. I need to make a bridge. No. Oh, a gear has to go there. What the hell happened? Oh,
[3907.74s -> 3915.86s]  it's too slippery. That's really slippery. All right. I gotta be careful. Ow. This mudslides
[3915.86s -> 3920.57s]  getting dangerous. I'm trying to repair this power station to open up access to the pumps,
[3921.21s -> 3927.14s]  but I slipped and fell. Would you lend me a mandible? Yeah. How do I get there? Can I help
[3927.14s -> 3950.92s]  you get up there? Do I actually have to pull you up? No. Is that helping? Oh, just like the movie
[3950.92s -> 3976.60s]  Up. Seen it. I'm going to go up. That work. Thanks for helping me out. You're a true friend.
[3976.60s -> 3985.24s]  Now I just need to find a way to fix this gearbox. Okay. So I help. I think I have an idea. All right,
[3985.24s -> 4000.12s]  check this out. What if I go like this? Not what I wanted to do. Can I attach this to the ceiling
[4000.12s -> 4015.59s]  over there? Or should I swing? I don't know what to do. You're killing him. I didn't kill him.
[4016.31s -> 4043.06s]  What do I do? Maybe I should fall. It's like mouth skin. What's happening? It called lips.
[4044.23s -> 4050.25s]  I'm telling you. No, it's mouth. I have this mouth skin. All right, hold on. What if I...
[4051.45s -> 4078.34s]  Okay. Very obviously. Will it eventually pull it the other way? It will. Okay. Kind of. I don't. I
[4078.34s -> 4099.86s]  need to understand physics. Hold on. All right. It's going. It's going. It's going. It's going.
[4099.86s -> 4130.81s]  All right. Got that. Got that. Okay. Now I got to pull this. And then, all right,
[4130.81s -> 4135.66s]  this is going to get pulled over here too. So let me get on the other side. Like this.
[4137.77s -> 4189.85s]  Oh, stupid. What the fuck? What? What are you talking about? All right. Wait, wait, wait. Do
[4189.85s -> 4211.03s]  a think. Do a think. You need to think. Hold on. Just give me a net so I can not keep falling down.
[4216.90s -> 4234.41s]  That longer? I think that's it. Here we go. Ready? See you later. Oh. Oh. I didn't get the grub.
[4234.97s -> 4254.84s]  That's okay. I don't want the rock. Stop picking the rock up. Get out of my way.
[4255.80s -> 4268.10s]  I'm working. Dude, seriously. Dude, get out of the way. Just get out of the way. Just get out of the
[4268.10s -> 4327.80s]  fucking way. Get out of the way. It's wedged into the middle of the rocks. Get out. Thank you. Hey,
[4327.80s -> 4332.36s]  I'm doing a cellar spider pattern, okay? They're the most intelligent of all the spiders.
[4332.92s -> 4338.36s]  You know why? Because they don't do this symmetrical web. They do this mess of a fucking web because it
[4338.36s -> 4346.02s]  catches more shit. The symmetrical pretty design. No. Cellar spiders understand what they're doing.
[4346.02s -> 4372.38s]  They do an incredibly messy design. It catches way more shit. Now get over here. Finally. Now extract
[4372.38s -> 4378.33s]  it. We're good. Did somebody fact check that? No, no, no. You can. Absolutely. Please do.
[4379.05s -> 4387.03s]  Cellar spider has an incredibly erratic design because it catches more stuff. Look it up.
[4387.67s -> 4413.13s]  Now what? It's true. Cellar spiders construct loose haphazard webs often in corners to catch
[4413.13s -> 4417.69s]  insect prey. They hang upside down on the web until a food item gets tangled. Once prey is captured,
[4417.69s -> 4424.50s]  a cellar spider vigorously shake their webs to further entangle their meal. That's what I'm
[4424.50s -> 4431.34s]  saying. Can everyone here that's telling me that I'm not a scientist go get the grub? I don't think
[4431.34s -> 4448.89s]  I can. I'll try. That cog better still be in there. Cellar spiders are really good for you.
[4448.89s -> 4456.58s]  They're just terrifying looking. Cellar spiders are really strange looking. They're kind of like
[4456.58s -> 4463.86s]  these white, yellowy, wispy looking. They have really long legs. They're really strange looking.
[4466.87s -> 4497.53s]  One and why I didn't take that one off. Oh, you piece of shit. It's not enough. It's not enough.
[4497.53s -> 4524.70s]  It might be enough. All right. I'm just trying to rush. Just stop rushing. That should do it.
[4526.92s -> 4566.30s]  Like that. One, two. Okay. There's one. That one's in a perfect spot. There it is. How am I supposed
[4566.30s -> 4581.74s]  to do that? Everything's in place. It's fine. I have to grab into there. It's going to be actually,
[4581.74s -> 4587.21s]  that's going to be hard to get. I have to shoot into there and down. That's going to be hard.
[4614.20s -> 4626.36s]  Okay. So I powered the station up. Very cool. Now this is the gas station. Did I go this way?
[4628.98s -> 4637.18s]  So I got power and now I need fuel. What are the dumb bullshit do I have to do here?
[4640.78s -> 4656.26s]  Take another grub. That's for sure. That's going to be a huge pain in the ass.
[4657.22s -> 4666.01s]  My patience is so low. So low. I just, it takes so much for me to, I know what I have to do here,
[4666.01s -> 4675.40s]  right? But the prospect of doing this is like, it's like I can tear fucking colors in my head.
[4675.40s -> 4681.78s]  I just don't want to do it. Does anybody else feel that? I see the solution. Like
[4682.58s -> 4689.14s]  gecko gecko gecko gecko gecko click. But my brain is just like, don't you want to just like
[4689.14s -> 4692.02s]  roll around on the ground? You know, I just don't want you to just want to roll around.
[4692.02s -> 4697.00s]  Yeah. I kind of just want to just like roll around on the ground. I don't want to like do this.
[4697.00s -> 4707.54s]  I don't want to do this. I know what I have to do. It's ADHD. I know, but still it's just, I
[4708.34s -> 4716.04s]  know what I have to do. I think my problem a lot of times I'm trying to music down.
[4716.60s -> 4727.40s]  The music's cool, but I can't even hear myself think. Um, I think it's because my brain has
[4727.40s -> 4735.85s]  already seen the solution. Puzzle games to me get really weird because I get this puzzle,
[4735.85s -> 4742.01s]  this big elaborate thing that I need to do. And in my head I see the solution. I've seen it finished
[4742.01s -> 4747.90s]  and I sit there and I go, I know what that looks like finished. It's this process of getting to
[4747.90s -> 4754.26s]  finishing that, that I don't want to do because I'm a very visual person. I can, these two are
[4754.26s -> 4759.14s]  connected in my brain right now. I'm watching it. They're connected. I'm looking at it right now.
[4759.14s -> 4764.20s]  It's literally a moving video in my head. I'm watching it. I just don't want to do it. He's
[4764.20s -> 4782.71s]  too smart. I don't want to connect these two fucking dryer vents. Okay. But I know I have to,
[4782.71s -> 4857.66s]  so I have to do it. No. Connect to the other one. Excuse me? Okay. Is that one? Oh, what a shit job.
[4857.66s -> 4878.38s]  Yeah. Is that wrong? Is that, was that, was it wrong? The one on the, I'm very confused.
[4878.38s -> 4925.38s]  It was not wrong. So what the hell's wrong? Do it! Why won't it do it? They're on. They're on,
[4925.38s -> 4937.75s]  right? That definitely looks on. They're both connected. Okay. They're both on. I'll turn
[4937.75s -> 4965.35s]  the machine on, right? Cool. Two grubs. That's pretty good deal. Where does this go? Okay. Two
[4965.35s -> 4984.26s]  of these. Awesome. Down there. There's a third cog over there. Okay. I gotta get them all up there.
[4984.26s -> 5006.38s]  You're reading this, please sing the victory song. SpongeBob? All right. Wait, wait, wait.
[5006.38s -> 5032.70s]  No, no, no, no. I gotta bring it back down here. Stay up here. Okay. You actually have the
[5032.70s -> 5044.02s]  behavioral patterns of a spider. You just confused me so much that now I, I didn't get the,
[5044.02s -> 5051.02s]  now I, now I don't? How do I have the behavioral patterns of a spider? Doesn't make any sense.
[5051.02s -> 5075.54s]  I don't, I'm not a spider. I think lizard is more accurate. Spiders are too delicate and they're
[5075.54s -> 5084.39s]  too calculated. Some of my happiest days have been just baking in the sun with my mouth open,
[5084.39s -> 5119.16s]  lying down on the ground. So I think I'm more of a, I think I'm more of a lizard. One, two. So yeah,
[5119.16s -> 5146.95s]  I would be a lizard and not cool looking either. I would, I'm not going to be a cool looking lizard.
[5146.95s -> 5157.13s]  But one, I would be the lizard that just lie there. They just lick their eyes. No, I'm not,
[5157.13s -> 5165.43s]  it's not, I'm not going to even say it. And when they run away, they do this thing where they go
[5165.43s -> 5172.30s]  like this, like they kind of shake their like arms like this and they kind of slide from side
[5172.30s -> 5184.57s]  to side and shake, shake, shake, shake, shake while they run. What is that? That's a crested gecko.
[5184.57s -> 5199.93s]  You're describing a spider. That's not a spider. No, the reason why you guys think I'm a spider is
[5199.93s -> 5207.74s]  because of the erratic movements, which I understand. I get that aspect of it. You know,
[5207.74s -> 5210.62s]  sometimes you're just looking at a spider, they'll just be sitting there and all of a sudden they just
[5210.62s -> 5216.95s]  go like this. They just rip another direction and it's like, holy shit, the thing moves so weirdly
[5216.95s -> 5225.11s]  and so fast. I don't, I can't, I don't like it. A squirrel does that too. A squirrel does do that.
[5225.11s -> 5233.70s]  A spider sometimes will be like this and then two or three seconds later with you'll blink
[5233.70s -> 5240.94s]  and it'll glitch and it'll be turning this way like that. It'll be like this. It's really weird.
[5240.94s -> 5253.61s]  Okay, so those are both in there. It's one more spot here, so that should do it.
[5253.61s -> 5283.59s]  Herman knows about the glitch spiders. I mean, spiders are weird.
[5283.59s -> 5302.66s]  Goodness, he's living in a video game. No, I wouldn't be a cool animal. Just clear the board,
[5302.66s -> 5308.38s]  clear the board, clear the board, clear the board and I'll be fine. What is it? Is it stuck to the
[5308.38s -> 5327.05s]  ground here? What the fuck is going on? Please. Can I pull this up? No, I can't. Okay. Well,
[5327.05s -> 5342.26s]  I can do this. At least I can do this. No, dude, seriously. Got it! All right, I filled it up.
[5342.26s -> 5353.82s]  There's enough gas. I think that's good. So now what? Now I filled the gas. You'd be like a magpie.
[5353.82s -> 5361.38s]  Yeah, I probably would be a bird. This is really annoying. It's constantly yelling non-secretors.
[5361.38s -> 5370.89s]  Birds kind of do that. Birds, I actually would be a bird. I'm trying to think of an animal that
[5370.89s -> 5376.38s]  would randomly for no reason just say they're great without any context. They just say it for
[5376.38s -> 5386.46s]  no reason. Yeah. Have you walked into a house with somebody that has birds that talk and you
[5386.46s -> 5397.21s]  just sit there kind of on the couch and it's just like, they're great. Fuck off. Stupid. Oh, you're,
[5397.21s -> 5414.70s]  you're a pretty bird. Oh, who wants a treat? Who wants a treat? They all do that. Look at that.
[5414.70s -> 5423.34s]  It's so creepy because it's always in their voice. The voice of the person who owns the bird.
[5424.30s -> 5431.51s]  It's terrifying and it sounds almost a little bit robotic. A little bit. It's a weird tape recording
[5431.51s -> 5441.19s]  version of that person saying it. It's so strange. It's like, um, it kind of, hold on. I'm gonna take
[5441.19s -> 5447.21s]  a second here. I'm gonna, I'm gonna be a fucking weirdo for a minute just in case anyone was trying
[5447.21s -> 5457.86s]  to chill today. Does this work? Does this work? Yeah, it works. Let's pretend I have a bird.
[5457.86s -> 5467.27s]  I'm gonna just pretend I have a bird back here. I got a new bird. But weirdly enough, it always
[5467.35s -> 5474.15s]  sounds, let's say it's an old lady that has the bird. The bird will be doing this whole routine.
[5477.35s -> 5482.39s]  Who's a pretty bird? It's like, holy shit. That was like, it was like grandma talking.
[5482.39s -> 5495.16s]  Let's see if I can get this. Hold on. It's good. Test it. It kind of sounds like this,
[5495.16s -> 5504.38s]  but not this deep here. Hold on. Let me fix it. That sounds kind of correct. It's a little better.
[5504.38s -> 5536.57s]  Hold on. This was better. Things to say. It's weird. This shit sounds exactly like this.
[5536.57s -> 5540.76s]  I've been in houses with people with birds before and it's just fucking terrifying in a way.
[5540.76s -> 5549.54s]  So imagine that that's, that's literally grandma's voice and you hear shit like this.
[5577.19s -> 5583.32s]  Anybody not gonna go see that fucking movie ever? Okay, here we go. There's a bird in the house.
[5593.99s -> 5603.42s]  Who's a pretty bird? Who wants a kiss? Who wants a kiss?
[5609.42s -> 5618.39s]  Oh, who's a pretty bird? Who wants a kiss? Who wants a kiss?
[5620.55s -> 5629.96s]  This goes on for 10 to 12 hours straight every day. This is scary. It's like scary.
[5638.58s -> 5647.10s]  That is scary. That is actually really scary. You guys know what I'm talking about though,
[5647.10s -> 5650.70s]  right? You guys get it. You know what I mean. You know what I mean by this, don't you?
[5652.17s -> 5658.89s]  I'm not crazy. That's actually what it's like. It sounds like a fucking old talkback tape recording
[5658.89s -> 5664.58s]  version of the person speaking, talking. It's fucking weird. What does it sound like? I don't
[5664.58s -> 5678.10s]  know. I'm scared to press it again. Oh, who's a pretty bird? It's weird, man. It's actually
[5678.10s -> 5699.14s]  fucking weird. You're fucked up. No, I'm telling you. I'm the smart one. Reconnect the propellant
[5699.14s -> 5709.77s]  pipes. Okay, so that's done. It's impossible for me to get killed. I actually don't even know how
[5709.77s -> 5720.33s]  that killed me. It's not even possible to die there. All right, so now I need to put the mandible
[5720.33s -> 5729.90s]  through the forge. Reconnect the water pipes. Reconnect the water pipes. Where am I? I have
[5729.90s -> 5737.35s]  to go down. Down to the lower right. Wasn't that where I was before? Isn't this the water
[5737.35s -> 5747.10s]  area down here? There's this. I forget where to go. This looks like a water pipe to me, doesn't it?
[5747.10s -> 5764.49s]  It would be less terrifying without the who wants a kiss mwah mwah mwah. But that's what they all
[5764.49s -> 5786.65s]  say. All right, I gotta focus. Leave me alone. We need to go this way and then down. What do I do
[5786.65s -> 5801.27s]  with the grubs again? I don't know. Who's kissing birds? I don't know. People that have birds,
[5801.27s -> 5812.47s]  they lean in and they... Right? I think so. What are you talking about? Oh, this is how I get down
[5812.47s -> 5834.15s]  here. This thing's operational again. People don't do that. I'm telling you they do. A sandwich. All
[5834.15s -> 5857.59s]  right, weigh that down. Yeah, they do. All right, it's good. It just sounds like a Disney movie.
[5857.59s -> 5870.18s]  Disney Pixar's Webbed in theaters May 20th. That sounds like a Disney movie name. It kind of does.
[5870.18s -> 5895.26s]  This game's cute though. I like it. Too heavy? Is it too heavy? Oh, I think it's a little too
[5895.26s -> 5922.06s]  heavy. No, maybe not. I'm panicking right now. Hey, what does that get me? Have you heard of
[5922.06s -> 5928.58s]  lyrebirds? They can perfectly emulate chainsaw sounds. Yeah, they're just tape recorders. They're
[5928.58s -> 5963.06s]  strange tape recorders. Feel like I'm gonna have to bring another one of these down here. Nice.
[5963.06s -> 5972.23s]  Holy shit. I was supposed to die there. I went in for one second. Wee. All right, what do I need to
[5972.23s -> 6006.90s]  do down here? The wheel. All right, first of all, do this so I don't fall in. Yikes. Is that... Okay,
[6006.90s -> 6014.12s]  put it in. Oh, you fixed the drawbridge already. Outstanding work. Now that the rest of the colony
[6014.12s -> 6024.52s]  can get through, we can start fixing this place up. I want you to turn it on. Oh, that's the way the
[6024.52s -> 6048.36s]  bridge is. Auto. Anything else up here? I don't think there's anything I can do up here. I'd have
[6048.36s -> 6058.81s]  to connect... I have to do the water pump thing, don't I? Or did I already do that? That connects
[6058.81s -> 6086.07s]  to here. It wants me to go this way. Can you bark again? What's the spider language? This. Okay,
[6086.07s -> 6094.01s]  so I need... What do I need to do? I need another ant leg. Reconnect the water pipes. What do I do
[6094.01s -> 6104.87s]  that? It said down here, water pipes. Remember? I'm just going back this way. Fuck it, I'm going
[6104.87s -> 6120.60s]  this way. Can you make some bird sounds? Probably. I have a fiver page if you want to pay for it.
[6124.23s -> 6132.36s]  The base is... It's one... For five dollars you get... I do one bird impression. It's about 10
[6132.36s -> 6138.63s]  seconds. Twenty dollars would get you two... Would get you three birds of your choice. And then 50
[6138.63s -> 6143.91s]  dollars gets you 10 birds of your choice. And I have a list of all the birds that I can do.
[6145.19s -> 6154.60s]  They range from cockatoo to chickadee to hummingbird. I have this... You can pick from a
[6154.60s -> 6160.65s]  list. If you want, just a little sample. I can give that to you just for a demo for anyone that
[6160.65s -> 6176.04s]  was interested. 60 dollars? Yeah. It's really good for background songs, background noise,
[6176.04s -> 6184.33s]  sampling. I've had a lot of people contact me over the first 10 seconds of songs. Whether it be
[6184.33s -> 6194.65s]  rock or rap music, whatever. Make a big intro. Doesn't matter. Genre. A lot of people use it
[6194.65s -> 6215.69s]  for a sample. Can I get a preview? Yeah, I mean, you've probably heard me a few times. Actually,
[6215.69s -> 6223.78s]  it was part of Hank Fuck's last album. It was featured a few times. He actually did the 50
[6223.78s -> 6237.88s]  dollar tier. If you remember, it's a pretty popular song. It has, I think, six or seven
[6237.88s -> 6246.20s]  hundred plays on Spotify. The opening is kind of like an inside echo-y instead of a cavern.
[6246.20s -> 6255.26s]  It has this big explosion sound. I think he used it there because I can kind of hear my chickadee.
[6255.26s -> 6262.09s]  The chickadee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee. It kind of blows boom and he goes into his new song.
[6262.09s -> 6275.11s]  This was a fun experience. Was that way too dank? Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I am so sorry if
[6275.11s -> 6279.11s]  that was that. That's why I need a new audio setup. I'm going to get a new audio setup. I'm
[6279.11s -> 6284.15s]  going to get a brand new setup. No more loud sounds. I swear to God, I promise. My audio is
[6284.15s -> 6303.16s]  going to be perfectly, perfectly done. That's not going to happen anymore. I promise. I'm going to
[6303.40s -> 6307.54s]  The compressor is going to be perfect. It's going to be perfect highs, perfect lows.
[6307.54s -> 6312.44s]  The next time I stream, I promise. Keep it like this. No, no, you don't like loud sounds.
[6312.44s -> 6316.44s]  You just say you like loud sounds because you want a loud sound to happen so you can go,
[6316.44s -> 6319.88s]  oh, shit, that probably fucked up somebody's ears because you think it's funny.
[6319.88s -> 6326.57s]  Somebody else's ears get fucked up. No, I don't want, I don't want any more loud sounds.
[6326.57s -> 6343.38s]  No more loud sounds. Here we go. Pump is going in. You got this. Hey, thanks. Chickadee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.
[6346.60s -> 6375.27s]  Chickadee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee. It's going to be hard to get up there.
[6375.27s -> 6382.86s]  Pump! Do I have to weigh it down or is this going to work? Fuck. Fucking piece of shit.
[6384.34s -> 6402.58s]  Fucking. Oh, I need another one. Okay. Let's do more. What? Why was that rude? It was me expressing
[6404.49s -> 6423.54s]  anger. Calm down. They're in the water? Stupid fucking goddamn fucking idiots. Fucking goddamn
[6423.54s -> 6437.10s]  stupid fucking goddamn game. Oh, they are here, yeah. Oh, is there whoever's on the ghost team?
[6437.34s -> 6454.42s]  Shut the fuck up right now. This is going to be such a pain in the ass. Oh, yikes. This is going
[6454.42s -> 6464.30s]  to be hell. How am I going to do this? I'm going to have to do it one at a time. One at a time.
[6464.30s -> 6490.30s]  Don't you wait on that one. Perfect. Isn't this guy supposed to be trying to find sponsors for
[6490.30s -> 6499.42s]  his streams? What? Because I said stupid fucking goddamn fucking idiots. You can swear and get
[6499.42s -> 6523.56s]  sponsors, right? But I stopped doing that. Just not very good ones. Not good ones. I'll be fine.
[6523.64s -> 6537.94s]  I'll be fine. There it is. All right. Water pipes reconnected. Pumping going on. I hope you don't
[6537.94s -> 6549.69s]  get any. Why not? Why? You don't want me to get... Why not? Hey, I want them. I'm going to get them.
[6549.69s -> 6571.08s]  Indram, I'm going to cancel my sponsorship. Okay, so I think I've been down in the ant
[6571.08s -> 6580.28s]  place for a long time. I need one more ant leg and I need the ant mouth. So how do I...
[6580.28s -> 6594.30s]  What do I go from here? Oh, it's filling the tank. All right. What happens if it goes all the way up?
[6594.30s -> 6605.67s]  Is the door going to open? Oh, cool. All right. So now I can leave through here. Oh, my goodness.
[6605.67s -> 6636.42s]  It's not going to kill me, right? Oh, my fucking God. Still going? Is it still going? Where's the
[6636.42s -> 6656.46s]  elevator there? What is this? The no talk stream? I haven't shut the hell up in 15 straight minutes.
[6656.46s -> 6665.51s]  Okay, I need one more leg. I did the power. I did the gas. I did all this. Water pipes,
[6665.51s -> 6680.23s]  propellant pipes, electricity. I need another ant leg down here maybe. What did I get? What did
[6680.23s -> 6714.15s]  I miss an ant leg? I need to go up. What's this twitch stream? So where am I now? So this is back
[6714.15s -> 6720.44s]  to the top of the ant hill. I don't want to leave the ant hill. I don't want to leave.
[6720.44s -> 6744.31s]  There's as much more to be done. Wrong way. Yeah, well, come on. So going up from here takes me out.
[6744.31s -> 6762.74s]  So I need to go left. This is not going into the highlight. Um, it is. Okay, so left from here,
[6762.74s -> 6772.06s]  I think. I'm gonna go left. Okay, so this is... I gotta hand it down here. Have I been over here?
[6772.06s -> 6799.61s]  I don't remember. I don't... I have not been over there. Fire? So I gotta put the fire out probably?
[6799.61s -> 6812.84s]  Suck up the water from here? You gotta forge the mandible. Well, somebody has to give it to me.
[6812.84s -> 6829.43s]  What do I get it? Do I have to bring it all the way over here? I can't go in there like Mario.
[6829.43s -> 6840.65s]  Are you ever gonna play Yakuza Zero like you promised? I know I said it a while ago, but
[6840.65s -> 6846.39s]  if somebody made a compilation of all the times I have lied on this stream or have not said the
[6846.39s -> 6851.93s]  thumb the thing I said I was going to do, it would be a four and a half up to five hour long video.
[6851.93s -> 6858.07s]  So I have to throw a mandible in here to forge it. Where do I get it?
[6858.07s -> 6868.25s]  And I imagine it would be done to the music of... what's that? Overture?
[6877.37s -> 6887.06s]  You'd have to replay that song three or four times. All right, there's one more leg and then the mouth.
[6889.54s -> 6896.95s]  Where is it? Down here? I'm gonna go there. I think I haven't... I don't think I've been down there.
[6896.95s -> 6906.76s]  I've been here. Yeah, it's right here, but what the fuck? How do I get it?
[6906.76s -> 6914.71s]  Where's this piece? There's a piece that I haven't found yet. No, I want to go down.
[6914.71s -> 6927.90s]  Okay, that's the 1812 Overture. All right, here we go. Thought you were gonna get me.
[6928.98s -> 7012.46s]  Nope. Oh my god! That just scared the hell out of me. You fucking idiot. This fucking rock needs
[7012.46s -> 7034.82s]  to get out of the way. Thank you. Interact with us! I'm... don't... look at how much I'm concentrating.
[7034.82s -> 7047.98s]  I'm sorry, if I'm diffusing a bomb, what wire do I cut next? Dance for us. Dance for us. You
[7047.98s -> 7060.46s]  should dance. Which wire? Who's the bomb? I need to fucking focus. We'll chat in just a minute.
[7060.46s -> 7072.15s]  Hold on. But you just keep failing over and over again. Just talk to us. Did I fail that time?
[7072.15s -> 7103.93s]  I better still save. It's there. It's there. I'm fine. Looks good. No, I just need... there it is.
[7106.14s -> 7158.98s]  Okay. Why did I... what was I doing? What am I doing? Seriously? We gotta go up. Okay. No, don't slide.
[7158.98s -> 7196.60s]  Go up. And then hand it to you. Check this out. Don't fire the gun. Oh my fucking god. Just...
[7196.60s -> 7206.55s]  I'm gonna scream. I'm so annoyed. I just... oh, I can see the solution. I can see it. I can
[7207.03s -> 7225.50s]  feel the solution. I just can't do the solution. Get the fuck over here! Oh my goodness,
[7225.50s -> 7234.79s]  I'm gonna lose my mind. Slow down. I can't slow down. I see the solution. It's already done.
[7234.79s -> 7243.91s]  My brain is like, do it already. He is standing, giving a peace sign, taking a picture with all
[7243.91s -> 7247.91s]  the webs in the right place. And I'm just fucking pissed at him. It's like, dude, I know... I can
[7247.91s -> 7263.54s]  see you done. I'm just... I need to get to it. Like he said, you took a vacation photo. Okay.
[7263.54s -> 7274.94s]  Take this down. Here it comes. Okay. Square one. Check it out. Slow down. Watch this. Bridge.
[7274.94s -> 7282.44s]  It was that easy. It was seriously... it was that simple. I just had to slow down.
[7282.44s -> 7287.34s]  Now that should go back up here. But I think... I feel like a bug just crawled over my hand.
[7287.34s -> 7317.69s]  Okay. Where... where is it? There it is. This has to go here, which will drop it. Okay. Now
[7318.25s -> 7331.80s]  this goes where? Nobody else has to pick this up, right? Over here? Right there. So now this comes
[7331.80s -> 7356.49s]  down. It's just a puzzle game with roguelike elements. Yeah. You're moving from point A to
[7356.49s -> 7391.99s]  point B. Yeah. That's accurate. Stop sliding. Slow down. I am. See, he just keeps... his forward
[7391.99s -> 7411.51s]  momentum keeps going. I'm not touching it. No, just burger boy technique. Just fucking burger
[7411.51s -> 7451.77s]  boy technique. Uh, that last one is here. So now I got all the legs. Jeremy, you're spending so much
[7451.77s -> 7456.23s]  fucking time with these ants. I mean, there's other shit to do with them. You're spending a
[7456.23s -> 7461.16s]  lot of time with these fucking ants, dude. Like, you've been outside a lot. You're just like,
[7461.16s -> 7463.96s]  you're digging around looking for fucking ants. I don't... I don't know what is...
[7463.96s -> 7489.27s]  getting a little concerned about you. Get out there. Quick. All right. Good. Done. Two hours
[7489.27s -> 7502.39s]  with the ants. I think this game's only three hours long. I could be wrong though. The mandible
[7502.39s -> 7515.51s]  through the forge. Where is this mandible? Here? Is it only because I haven't gone? Like, right?
[7517.66s -> 7530.23s]  Right? Down, right? Down, right? Left? Should I connect these? Connect the pipes to the ants.
[7530.23s -> 7542.90s]  Connect this? What do I connect it? On top? Oh, look at it. It goes on top.
[7542.90s -> 7578.02s]  You're right. Yeah, okay. Please attach. Please attach. Please attach. There it is.
[7578.02s -> 7627.34s]  It was attached! What the fuck? Okay, it's attached. Ooh! Attached. Why is it not attaching?
[7627.34s -> 7640.36s]  It should have attached by now. Why? What is with this fucking elephant nose? Get over here. Attach!
[7647.74s -> 7667.42s]  Attach! Attach to the thing! It's running. I have to attach the oil thing. Is it already done?
[7668.73s -> 7674.78s]  It doesn't attach. Oh, wait. I had to fuel it. Oh, okay. All right. Whatever. All right. So,
[7674.78s -> 7687.43s]  I gotta go right. I haven't been down here. I thought I had to stay on there. No, I gotta go
[7687.43s -> 7700.42s]  up. Up and to the right. This dude doesn't know what's happening. No, not really. I'm just here
[7700.42s -> 7718.34s]  for the ride. Okay. I have not gone down to the right. Where am I now? No. I need to go. It's left?
[7718.34s -> 7727.94s]  I haven't explored over here. There's a question mark over here. Down here. Where have I not gone?
[7727.94s -> 7733.88s]  Go back to the flame thing. Yeah, but I need the mandible. Where do I get the mandible?
[7733.88s -> 7756.41s]  The giant gas tank says left. Yeah, but I need the mandible though. The mandible is at the
[7756.41s -> 7773.02s]  giant flame. Did I not pick it up or something? Chad is wrong. Are they? Where am I? Okay. I'm
[7773.02s -> 7781.94s]  kind of going down to the furnace again here. Okay. So, this is the gas. Do I have to go all
[7781.94s -> 7802.42s]  the way back over here? Over here? I have to go over here, don't I? I am lost. Yeah. I am lost.
[7802.42s -> 7812.34s]  Oh, just respawn me. Just fucking give me a checkpoint. I'm just fucking going so fast.
[7812.34s -> 7845.06s]  I can see the solution in my head. You motherfucker. Okay. Back. Back. Back. Back.
[7845.06s -> 7852.63s]  Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Go on a home run. So, now we go over
[7852.63s -> 7871.83s]  here. So, where's the mandible? How do I open this? I can't open this. And unless there's
[7871.83s -> 7877.91s]  something I can do here, I pull this up or take this with me somehow? I can't scoop this up.
[7883.37s -> 7896.06s]  Because there's a big forge over here, but I don't have the mandible. If I touch this, I die.
[7896.06s -> 7909.16s]  Jump in the forge? Is it below this room? I've been in all these rooms already. I feel like I
[7909.16s -> 7920.70s]  need to go all the way left, but I can't open that door. I mean, right here. I can't get in there.
[7920.70s -> 7935.62s]  Something weird with this pipe, probably, right? It was down. No. This is the only place I haven't
[7935.62s -> 7962.46s]  been. So, I kind of feel like it has to be there. Wait, I can just use this? That's pretty cool.
[7962.46s -> 7979.59s]  I thought that was a one-time thing. All right. So, where the hell am I going? Find the mandible.
[7979.59s -> 7992.10s]  I must have just missed it somewhere. I think I just missed it. Just straight up missed it
[7992.10s -> 8005.72s]  somehow. Because this thing's ready to go. I just need the front. This is the engineering room,
[8005.72s -> 8022.50s]  which this takes me down here. Maybe it is over here. You passed it? Up one. Medium left. Medium
[8022.50s -> 8034.92s]  left. What do you mean? Go left. Medium left. I went past it. Medium left. Stop saying you're
[8034.92s -> 8047.62s]  breaking the- Okay. Yeah. I see what you're doing. Forge. Oh, nice. Okay. I don't think I did this.
[8047.62s -> 8068.65s]  No, I did. No, I didn't. There's got to be grubs up here, right? Whoa. Do you trust chat with your
[8068.65s -> 8080.15s]  life? Guys, if there were two doors, because I was doing an IRL stream and one of the doors was
[8080.15s -> 8088.90s]  safe. So, it's like a green door and a blue door, right? And behind the green door was a room full
[8088.90s -> 8094.25s]  of fire and flames. And if I opened it, I would get engulfed in flames and I would get fucking
[8094.25s -> 8101.27s]  annihilated. And on the right door, the other door was an ice cream party. A ton of people in chat
[8101.27s -> 8105.91s]  would be like, left door. Pepe, left. You should pick the left one. And it would be like, oh,
[8105.91s -> 8111.59s]  left door chat? Really? Yeah. Pick the left one. You guys are trying to fucking get me incinerated.
[8112.15s -> 8122.39s]  There'd be people in chat saying like, guys, no, dude, like, you're actually going to incinerate
[8122.39s -> 8129.35s]  them. Like, stop trolling, please. And then they would get timed out because they use too many
[8129.35s -> 8153.35s]  caps. I did it. I'll heat it up. No health. No health. Yeah. I would take my hand. I'd put my
[8153.35s -> 8162.04s]  hand on the door. They'd be like, hey, this one? You guys think it's this one? Oh, chat. That hurt.
[8162.04s -> 8167.86s]  That kind of hurt my hand. It's all red. There's a huge red circle. And I would look over and just
[8167.86s -> 8176.79s]  be no health. No health. Okay. I guess I'm going in. All right. Send these mandibles through the
[8176.79s -> 8190.84s]  forge. No vers. No health. Yeah. And then I would open the door up. It would be, there'd be a bunch
[8190.84s -> 8198.34s]  of, oh my God, deface, deface, deface. And then the next day, two or three days later, there'd be
[8198.34s -> 8203.88s]  people in the chat that would be typing, where is he? How come he hasn't streamed in three days?
[8203.88s -> 8219.29s]  Where the fuck is he? Excuse me? Where's the stream? He's late. He's supposed to be here. Oh,
[8219.29s -> 8235.46s]  up there. Where is he? Yeah. People say like, oh, that stream sucked, by the way. Like, that was
[8235.46s -> 8247.19s]  like kind of a dumb stream. I wasn't a big fan. That was like, dude, that was like really dangerous.
[8247.19s -> 8272.79s]  He's going to have some explaining to do when he comes back. That was extra. Let go. Worst stream
[8272.79s -> 8315.22s]  of the year. Oh, I was almost there. All right. Stop being panicking. Yes. Another hellfire door
[8315.22s -> 8336.02s]  stream. Okay. So I have to send this through the forge. Spinning. That's spinning. Ah, I get it.
[8337.42s -> 8368.58s]  What are we waiting for? What's wrong? Why is everybody freaking out? Let's not. I told him,
[8368.58s -> 8394.78s]  get new audio equipment. It might've been like an audio problem. I'm so impatient. I am so impatient.
[8394.78s -> 8400.71s]  I would like Uber Eats a glass of water from fucking down, like in my downstairs. You know
[8400.71s -> 8408.41s]  what I'm saying? I would Uber Eats a glass of water. I'm so impatient. I'm so lazy. Just do it
[8408.41s -> 8414.58s]  right. Just do it right. Just do it. It's here. It's in front of you. Just do it. That would take
[8414.58s -> 8430.06s]  longer. I know. That's what I'm saying. This has taken so much longer because I'm so impatient.
[8430.06s -> 8452.70s]  Okay. This over here. Hold up. If it wasn't so heavy. There we go. All right. Oh, the lever.
[8453.34s -> 8505.53s]  Okay. Go. Oh, yay. Oh, go like this. Oh, oh, do it. We're so close. Just burger boy it again.
[8505.53s -> 8526.42s]  Not a bad idea. Did it work? Okay. So now this is going to get grabbed. I'll wait for the next
[8526.42s -> 8543.03s]  rotation. Make sure it's only good. Oh, it took you fucking forever. Okay. Now let's pass it
[8543.03s -> 8554.81s]  through the forge. Here we go. Cool. G'day. It's all heated up. Now we go through here.
[8554.81s -> 8572.74s]  Punch that button. Oh, that's how we get over here. Cool. So now I should have the mandible.
[8572.74s -> 8582.71s]  I think that's pretty much it. That looks hot. Can I even touch this? This probably kills me if I
[8582.71s -> 8592.55s]  touch it. No, it's all right. No, it does not. It's not all right. By the only way I can barely
[8592.55s -> 8610.86s]  hear the music. Yeah, it's kind of one single loop, but it's a good loop. Yeah, it's good.
[8610.86s -> 8619.54s]  Do I have to cool this off? I definitely do. Don't I? Yeah, there's no way I don't have to do that.
[8619.54s -> 8644.25s]  Open the hellfire door. Where are you moving this? You duck. You know what a really great word is?
[8644.25s -> 8687.32s]  Quench. Thirst quench. Quench is such a great word. Pull it. There we go. Nice and
[8687.40s -> 8715.53s]  cool by going into the coolant. Hooray. Got it. There it is. Final piece. Time to put it back on.
[8715.53s -> 8727.00s]  And then that's it for the ants. Now we're just gonna bring this down. How far down?
[8727.00s -> 8737.64s]  Let me scope this out first. It's gotta go here. I gotta attach to this. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.
[8737.64s -> 8761.98s]  Come on. Do it. Come on. Oh, please. Exactly what I wanted. All right. Let's get it.
[8761.98s -> 8816.89s]  Mandible attached. Shit. What? Oh, that's not good. Get up. I'm so mad. Okay, let's just go around.
[8816.89s -> 8839.70s]  What the fuck am I gonna do about this? Do I have to go all the way around the other side?
[8839.70s -> 8915.56s]  Stop touching that. Move. He's so focused. I don't want to mess this up. Gotta attach it up here.
[8921.53s -> 8929.45s]  Hey, looking good, comrade. Get over here and let's have a talk. It's ready. It's fueled up.
[8929.45s -> 8940.70s]  Mission accomplished. Kind of sloppy, but I did it. It worked out. Hold up a second. The platoon is
[8940.70s -> 8954.62s]  moving out. Got seen. We're having a great stream so far. I just joined and I happened to notice
[8954.62s -> 8958.92s]  that the title says be in a bug. I want to let you know that spiders are not bugs. They are
[8958.92s -> 8970.44s]  arachnids. So maybe you can change the title to something more appropriate. Thanks. What a beautiful
[8970.44s -> 8985.66s]  display. Arachnids. No, they're aliens. They're all aliens. Do you guys know the bugs have been
[8985.66s -> 8992.49s]  around since 500 trillion years or so before the dinosaurs? They've been around. They're the most
[8992.49s -> 9002.06s]  prehistoric creature and they still exist. They were mosquitoes back when the T-Rex was in law
[9002.06s -> 9007.85s]  school. You know what I'm saying? They've been around for so long and they're still around. How
[9007.85s -> 9011.98s]  do they stick around for so long? All right. Send a workforce ahead to help out with your mission on
[9011.98s -> 9017.50s]  the surface. They'll have that balloon up and flying before you know it. Dismissed. I got it.
[9019.61s -> 9034.60s]  Very cool. Okay. Find some fuel. So let's go to the surface. Aliens. I don't know. They're bugs.
[9034.60s -> 9039.30s]  They have to be aliens. Look at them. They've been around for 500 trillion years or something
[9039.30s -> 9052.79s]  and look at the sounds they make. Unfrozen T-Rex lawyer. Why do I feel like that's a show
[9053.51s -> 9069.56s]  that is on Adult Swim right now? Okay, so now what? I need one more grub. Oh man,
[9069.56s -> 9077.98s]  I really do need one more grub. But I don't, I kind of don't care. Is that where the fly should
[9077.98s -> 9098.97s]  hand it into the fly, right? Where's the fly? Harvey Birdman? Harvey Birdman. That's, what is it?
[9102.60s -> 9111.05s]  Ha ha. Stephen Colbert, right? Stephen Colbert. Ha ha. That's the only thing I know of the whole
[9111.05s -> 9126.31s]  show. I remember it being a good show though, right? Wait, you can fly? No, not, not. Ha ha.
[9128.82s -> 9144.57s]  I can't. You have to take all the air out. It's like, ha ha. No, there was still air in there.
[9144.57s -> 9160.92s]  Look at how cute that is. Ha ha. Stephen Colbert. Well, now I know. All right. All right. All right.
[9161.08s -> 9164.71s]  We're pivoting. We're pivoting. We're pivoting. We're pivoting. We're pivoting. We're pivoting.
[9164.71s -> 9170.42s]  We're pivoting. We're pivoting. Pivot! It's time for a pivot! I'm fucking loud and annoying. I'm
[9170.42s -> 9178.07s]  sorry. Your airship mechanic. We're almost ready for the trip of a lifetime. Take these blueprints
[9178.07s -> 9191.40s]  that we've got lots to do. Fuel engine patches, map, moth nest, spider webs. Okay. Rest of our
[9191.40s -> 9196.54s]  pre-flight checklist. Find a way to patch up the balloon. Bees to the east might be able to help
[9196.54s -> 9202.47s]  with that. Find a fuel source. Some good concentrated dung would work. Find some of the west.
[9202.47s -> 9208.57s]  Attach engine immediately below the mouth of the balloon. Your pilot platform. Oh, I forgot.
[9208.57s -> 9212.10s]  If you run into any trouble, just shoot the work bell and we'll reset everything for you.
[9212.10s -> 9217.93s]  And well, I need to get this stuff first. Oh, shit in this game.
[9219.46s -> 9224.10s]  These ants showed up just ahead of you. A quick work of the tree. They've been
[9224.10s -> 9227.94s]  badgering me with designs for ages, but I've not had the courage to let them try it.
[9227.94s -> 9235.94s]  Glad you're helping each other though. Your plans seem solid even if they're too bold for me.
[9235.94s -> 9254.66s]  Okay. So that's to float away. I need to find some fuel. Where should I go? Oh, cute. I guess
[9254.66s -> 9267.24s]  I could go to the west. Go to the bees. I'm going to go east. East. Or should I turn in the fly
[9267.24s -> 9282.23s]  stuff first? It's somewhere over here. Where's the fly? Where is he? Where is he? Because I have a
[9282.23s -> 9310.12s]  ton of those grubs, don't I? I don't know where the fly is. Fly is more to the left. Where you at?
[9310.12s -> 9333.11s]  Here? Yeah, he's right up there. Right there. Greetings, spider. I appreciate your visit and
[9333.11s -> 9345.06s]  your continued virtue. That's not what those are for? You're the Doctor Who Twitch. I don't
[9345.06s -> 9349.54s]  get that reference because I've only seen one episode of Doctor Who ever. And so when would
[9349.54s -> 9356.81s]  they time travel around like five times and he sees himself five times? I don't know what you
[9356.81s -> 9366.62s]  mean by that. Anytime I think of Doctor Who, I could be completely off with this. But I always
[9366.62s -> 9376.06s]  think of like Doctor Who to me is like a Harry Potter for adults. Is that correct? Does that make
[9376.06s -> 9387.18s]  any sense? I feel like it's like the Harry Potter type kind of sci-fi fantasy world as for like a
[9387.18s -> 9395.53s]  grown-up audience. Not that he's a wizard. No, I'm just saying it's like that fantasy kind of
[9395.53s -> 9413.64s]  whimsical world of Doctor Who, right? It's very whimsical. Harry Potter isn't sci-fi.
[9415.80s -> 9426.30s]  What, you don't remember the part where they were shooting the blasters? Okay, I got a quest for
[9426.30s -> 9434.33s]  you. The queen is making a new princess to make a brand new hive. To make a princess she needs
[9434.33s -> 9440.09s]  royal jelly and to make the jelly she needs pollen. Only the best pollen. Pink orchid pollen. 20
[9440.09s -> 9449.02s]  grains should do it. Bring that up to Canopy's Peak. I bet she'd love you. Come on. Okay, very
[9449.02s -> 9459.10s]  cool. So okay, give me a... I don't know anything about Doctor Who. I want a just a small quick
[9459.10s -> 9466.65s]  paragraph TLDR of... Okay, Doctor Who. Each season of Doctor Who, it's like Final Fantasy,
[9466.65s -> 9475.27s]  right? They're not connected. They're independent universes or something. It's like Final Fantasy.
[9475.27s -> 9487.98s]  How many seasons of... Yeah, Doctor Who. Explain it to me. What is it? They're all connected. Oh.
[9487.98s -> 9498.41s]  Okay, silly person travels with friends. Wacky British alien who time travels and does
[9498.41s -> 9510.01s]  fucked up stuff. Immortal alien. Hold on, this person has it. The doctor is an immortal alien
[9510.01s -> 9521.59s]  who travels through time sorting out his personal problems with mortals. He's an alien that changes...
[9521.59s -> 9526.68s]  So he's Rick from Rick and Morty. Alien that changes form every so often and goes on big
[9526.68s -> 9532.23s]  space and time adventures and has fun shit and does fun stuff and has funny catchphrases. And he
[9532.23s -> 9537.19s]  figures out his problems. I may have just caused the whole internet to fucking hate my life.
[9541.16s -> 9547.80s]  So he's Rick from Rick and Morty. How much you guys just turned purple, I think. I think a bunch
[9547.80s -> 9558.09s]  you guys turned purple. I'm just fucking kidding. I don't know anything about the show. I've never
[9558.09s -> 9572.39s]  seen it. I've heard really good things about it. Somebody in All Capital said, it's not Rick and
[9572.39s -> 9587.77s]  Morty. I know. I'm just fucking around. I'm fucking with you. I promise. Okay, it's not Rick and
[9587.77s -> 9595.48s]  Morty. It's not. But let me just be very clear. Let me be very fair. I see the same amount of
[9595.48s -> 9622.86s]  merchandise of Dr. Who at Spencer Gifts that I see from Rick and Morty. I mean, actually fair.
[9622.86s -> 9633.40s]  So who's everybody's favorite doctor then? There's a new doctor every season, right?
[9633.40s -> 9640.82s]  How many seasons are there? And is it worth getting into? And tell me the truth. I remember
[9640.82s -> 9644.34s]  before when we talked about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure one time. We're like, dude, you would
[9644.34s -> 9648.98s]  love JoJo. Oh my God. It would be like your favorite series ever. Just skip the first season.
[9648.98s -> 9655.16s]  Go to episode five of season three. Watch that one twice. And then after you watch that episode
[9655.16s -> 9661.56s]  two times, go back and watch the first episode. After you finish the first episode, then you're
[9661.56s -> 9666.26s]  free to watch the rest of the series. Let's start at season six. You can actually skip. You know,
[9666.26s -> 9673.64s]  nevermind. Nevermind. Skip the first five seasons of JoJo. And I'm just like, okay, can I just watch
[9673.64s -> 9690.10s]  the show? I'll just watch the show, I guess. Skippers? Yeah. What the hell? Watch it. Don't
[9690.10s -> 9696.38s]  skip anything. Just watch the whole thing. Yeah, I know, but that's what I mean. Just start at
[9697.75s -> 9704.92s]  seasons one through five are pretty good. See, here we go. Here we go. I'm telling you, here we go.
[9704.92s -> 9717.00s]  Well, man, you know, he's correct though. Seasons one through five are, I'm not so sure about that.
[9717.00s -> 9721.64s]  It looks crazy though. I actually, I was going to watch it at one point, but I just kind of didn't.
[9731.82s -> 9739.21s]  News is spreading. People are seething. What? What news? What do you mean? What news? News is
[9739.21s -> 9744.22s]  spreading. People are mad. What do you mean? News is spreading. What did I do about? I'm going to
[9744.22s -> 9752.55s]  apologize. What do I need to apologize for? What is it? What the fuck? I'm so mad because I called
[9752.55s -> 9759.35s]  Dr. Who Rick from Rick and Morty. Let me apologize. Let me just really quickly fix this. Let me fix
[9759.35s -> 9770.74s]  this. I, let me, hold on. I was wrong. I, somebody said just, they gave me a really, really basic
[9770.74s -> 9775.70s]  understanding of what the show is. They said it's a guy that travels through space and figures out
[9775.70s -> 9781.46s]  his problems with mortals and time travels and has interesting lasers and stuff. So I was like,
[9781.46s -> 9794.81s]  okay, so he's Rick Sanchez. And then now everyone wants to kill me. I, but I, I was very uninformed.
[9794.81s -> 9800.86s]  I was very uninformed. I, I'm very uninformed. Fucking get him. Bring up the Spencer's argument
[9800.86s -> 9805.96s]  again. No, it wasn't an argument. He keeps just jumping on spikes. Everybody relax. What I meant
[9805.96s -> 9813.11s]  to say was, listen to me. I, I don't know anything about the show. I don't know anything about the
[9813.11s -> 9816.63s]  show. I just thought it was like, whatever. I, I didn't know anything about it. And I made it,
[9816.63s -> 9822.71s]  I made it a little, little joke that just didn't, didn't go over well. And people thought it was not
[9822.71s -> 9829.75s]  funny. And how dare I compare those two shows? I look at, hey, look, the legacy of Dr. Who. Oh,
[9829.75s -> 9833.83s]  I mean, it's one of the most respected television shows like ever on British television. Right? I
[9833.83s -> 9839.82s]  mean, we all know that. Of course I respect it. I'm just, isn't off. This is a cop comment.
[9839.82s -> 9855.18s]  Everyone's booing him. Stop booing me. How many, I need, uh, how many more? There's no turning back
[9855.18s -> 9884.65s]  now. Your career is over. This is, it's just an observation. It wasn't real. It wasn't real.
[9884.65s -> 9891.66s]  It was an observation. I was observing. I was just observing. I want to go high. There we go.
[9891.66s -> 9904.90s]  There it is. Oh, 20, right? Dig your heels in, dude. You do, you have to start digging your heels
[9904.90s -> 9922.97s]  in now. You lost a thousand viewers because of that. I'm sorry. I don't watch TV guys. I really
[9922.97s -> 9934.17s]  don't get a lawyer. Can you imagine? I guess we're dealing with, uh, the, uh, the state, the state
[9934.17s -> 9941.21s]  of Nevada versus Jeremy Albertson and the, uh, he talked about how Rick Sanchez and the doctor were
[9941.21s -> 9953.38s]  essentially the same person being sued. It's so funny. I was just so inaccurate. That statement
[9953.38s -> 9958.94s]  probably was that people, I probably had some people spit their drink out. What's my 2022
[9958.94s -> 9975.24s]  yearly anime? That's a good question. What is my 2022 yearly anime? What do you guys think? Oh,
[9975.24s -> 9981.00s]  you know what? No, I called it the Harry Potter for adults too. Didn't I? I made a lot of just
[9981.00s -> 9990.30s]  like, like, like just statements, huh? I would just full of shit this whole time. I'll say what
[9990.30s -> 9993.66s]  I did see of doctor who I actually really, I thought was actually really good. I thought
[9993.66s -> 10002.28s]  the episode was really good. It was the one with, uh, David, yeah, David, um, what's his name? David
[10002.28s -> 10006.98s]  Tennant. He was great. I've seen at least a few clips. I've seen, I've seen at least two or three
[10006.98s -> 10023.74s]  episodes. Oh boys, people are gonna be mad about this, but I'm going to show it because I have to
[10023.74s -> 10050.63s]  because I just, I have to. I don't know. I honestly don't even know the context of that image.
[10051.19s -> 10071.85s]  Some of you maybe get it. I don't get it. That's a line from the show. I thought, oh, I thought you
[10071.85s -> 10079.50s]  were combining two things. I thought the, I'm doctor who in the, in this motherfucker. I thought
[10079.50s -> 10083.98s]  that was you, there was a Rick Sanchez. You were combining two of them. Like, I'm doctor who in
[10083.98s -> 10090.81s]  this motherfucker. Yeah, that's right. Me, Rick, doctor who. Yeah. I thought that's what you were
[10090.81s -> 10099.50s]  doing. That's not what you were doing. Okay. That's a line that doctor who says, I'm very confused.
[10099.50s -> 10108.28s]  I'm incredibly confused right now. Who, who says that? That's a line from the show. Rick says that
[10108.28s -> 10118.62s]  in one of the later seasons. Wait, he does? Wait, Rick says that in the show as a joke, like the joke
[10118.62s -> 10141.64s]  of, oh, I don't watch either one of these shows guys. I don't. What? What? I don't know. Should I
[10141.64s -> 10149.58s]  show these? I feel like I'm going to make everybody hate me. You fucked up so bad. I don't watch either
[10149.58s -> 10155.42s]  of these shows. You could show me, you could gaslight me so bad on both these shows. In fact,
[10155.42s -> 10159.42s]  I think that's what happened. It's, I'm sorry. People have been just like gaslighting me this
[10159.42s -> 10164.46s]  whole time and I, they were telling me like what that doctor who was Rick and Morty. So I believed
[10164.46s -> 10177.21s]  him. So that's what I made that comment about Spencer Gifts and everybody got mad. All right.
[10177.21s -> 10182.42s]  All right. I get it. Okay. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I thought,
[10182.42s -> 10197.18s]  okay, I thought you made that up. Rick and Morty came out first. Oh my goodness. That person's,
[10197.98s -> 10215.19s]  you need to turn off your DMs. This is supposed to be a stream where I played a game with as a
[10215.19s -> 10219.74s]  bug and we've relaxed. So that's what we're going to do. That's what we're going to do.
[10221.11s -> 10225.59s]  I, I apologize to all the doctor who fans and all the Rick and Morty fans and all the Harry Potter
[10225.59s -> 10233.10s]  fans. Sorry. I've been on a roll the last few weeks talking about everybody's favorite television
[10233.10s -> 10240.89s]  shows and movies that I thought would, but I'd never seen them. Nevermind. You've ruined my life.
[10243.11s -> 10257.93s]  Okay. I need to find little things. I apologize. Let me ask you a question though.
[10257.93s -> 10266.58s]  What I know that, okay, is there a show that if I, I feel like Rick and Morty has just,
[10266.58s -> 10271.69s]  has a ton of people that like it, are big fans, but a ton of people that hate it.
[10271.69s -> 10283.83s]  What's a show that has a bunch of people that just hate it? It's just, everybody doesn't like it.
[10283.83s -> 10295.93s]  Is there one game of Thrones? All right. Game of Thrones is pretty close. Got it. That's a tough
[10295.93s -> 10309.96s]  question. Oh my God. I'm feeling so terribly. Okay. I need, dude, big mouth, big mouth,
[10309.96s -> 10317.58s]  the big bang theory. No, I don't, dude, big bang theory has a ton of fans. That show lasted
[10317.58s -> 10334.81s]  almost 10 years. It had $600 trillion in revenue somehow. That show had a lot of fans. Okay.
[10334.81s -> 10348.62s]  There's one here. All right. Seven more. Riverdale. Riverdale. People saying Riverdale. Young
[10348.62s -> 10361.29s]  Sheldon. Oh, my sister was a real cool character. Me and my trains and my brother and my father.
[10369.30s -> 10381.30s]  That's how I know. Yup. Bingo. Bingo. There it is. Bingo. I knew it. I knew I could unite you all
[10381.30s -> 10402.74s]  in your collective hatred of me. I knew I could unite everybody. All right. Six more.
[10402.74s -> 10411.29s]  I was actually, me and Holly were talking about shows that we wanted to catch up with or watch.
[10412.01s -> 10415.69s]  I haven't seen any of Better Call Saul after season two. I want to watch a lot of that.
[10417.51s -> 10425.03s]  The boys season three is coming out, right? Which I don't know if I'm excited for it, but it's okay.
[10425.03s -> 10435.70s]  I was, I thought it was all right. I kind of want to see what happens. Boy season two was boring.
[10435.70s -> 10443.66s]  Yeah, that's, I mean, it was all right. It was just, season one was crazy. You want me to help
[10443.66s -> 10458.60s]  you? I gotta help this guy. Can I not help you? Can't break it. Barry's pretty good.
[10459.42s -> 10478.04s]  Barry was pretty good. Press E. Better Call Saul is the best. Did I just eat him? Oh, I just ate him.
[10478.04s -> 10487.75s]  Have you watched any good documentaries lately? I fell asleep through Supersize Me 2,
[10487.75s -> 10492.23s]  but that's not because the documentary wasn't bad or something. I just was really, really tired.
[10505.19s -> 10511.62s]  I love, you know what it is? YouTube has free movies where you just, they just ads,
[10511.62s -> 10520.12s]  just ad-supported movies. And it's just a bunch of weird old shit. I'll just pick one of those
[10520.20s -> 10537.42s]  and just watch it. You should watch The Expanse. Yeah, everyone's saying to watch The Expanse,
[10537.42s -> 10555.27s]  but isn't The Expanse just Rick and Morty for adults? I think I got them all over here.
[10555.27s -> 10581.16s]  Did I go this way? I did not. That's a great show. That's a great bait. What a troll. Yeah,
[10582.09s -> 10600.86s]  yeah, I know. The Expanse is actually Harry Potter for kids. Go fly. How come I'm not flying?
[10600.86s -> 10615.06s]  This is being completely uninformed and just talking out my ass. There are people that,
[10615.06s -> 10619.61s]  I know we talk about this and we fuck around, but there are probably people that have come to this
[10619.61s -> 10623.13s]  stream and have heard me say like, dude, this guy just said Dr. Who was fucking Rick and Morty.
[10623.13s -> 10632.94s]  I fucking hate this guy. I mean, that makes me sad in a way. This is going to be hard.
[10633.50s -> 10655.58s]  I got to hang. There we go. Okay. If you care enough about Dr. Who to get mad at that,
[10661.27s -> 10679.30s]  I need to fucking focus. Let me focus. So where, what's safe? Maybe I should just grab one of these.
[10681.38s -> 10716.66s]  Oh, yep. Got it. Oh yeah. All right. Only two more. Spot over here. The peak is over here.
[10716.66s -> 10720.98s]  Only one more after this. Hopefully I didn't miss any. It'd be very unhappy if I did.
[10729.27s -> 10750.66s]  19. One more. Toothstream? Oh, but what is a toothstream? Oh, you know what Holly brought
[10750.66s -> 10758.66s]  up yesterday that I didn't even realize? The old Scooby-Doo had a laugh track. That's so weird.
[10758.66s -> 10782.76s]  Cartoons had laugh tracks. Right here. Yes. I didn't miss any. Yeah, I did. Stop. I didn't
[10782.76s -> 10801.54s]  notice. No. Yeah, it had celebrity guests too. Here comes my impatience. All right. Slow down.
[10801.54s -> 10825.27s]  I'm a spider for God's sake. Like just, just do this. So much safer. Yeah. What are you doing?
[10825.27s -> 10844.06s]  There we go. Go to the peak. Save. I'm not. No. Why do you want me to say that? You want to clip
[10844.06s -> 10861.29s]  it so you can make me look like an idiot? Any more than 20? I know it's not an old idea,
[10861.29s -> 10877.82s]  but having a random laugh track to show up during the stream. I think it's kind of funny.
[10877.82s -> 10895.14s]  You already did that. Yeah, I know. Please save Bazinga. I got other people saying it.
[10895.14s -> 10909.96s]  What do you mean I got? Why does that mean? Hey, dude, I got other people to say it.
[10909.96s -> 10932.17s]  Oh, I move fast. I do. What am I doing? All right. I got to go to the peak. I've got 20.
[10941.10s -> 10962.90s]  Just wanted that last one. All right. Why does mates eat their heads? That's fucking weird.
[10962.90s -> 10976.84s]  All right. Almost there. Come on. I was right there, dude. Come on, dude. Come on, bro.
[10976.84s -> 10980.94s]  Praying mantis. I think a lot of bugs eat each other. Tons of bugs eat each other.
[10980.94s -> 10996.20s]  It's over here. Oh, hey again. Glad to see you took me up on the pollen quest.
[10996.20s -> 11001.37s]  Annabee's peak is just a bit further this way. Hope you don't. Hope you get the 20 we need.
[11001.37s -> 11012.66s]  The queen is waiting. I got it. I'm on it. Ants eat other ants. Yeah, it's weird.
[11012.66s -> 11022.09s]  God, ants are so weird. Bugs are so weird in general. I could tell you before.
[11023.21s -> 11030.49s]  Ants are just a math problem. Ants are math. The weird coordination. They're just a calculation.
[11031.42s -> 11049.88s]  Ants are math. They're almost a simple AI. It's really interesting. Reused bit.
[11049.88s -> 11054.50s]  Well, it's not reused because last time I did this bit, I think there were four or five
[11054.50s -> 11061.27s]  thousand people here. Now there's 50,000 in current viewers. My goodness. Thanks, guys.
[11061.27s -> 11077.50s]  Welcome to the stream. All right. We're almost there. Yeah. Just wait. Just wait for the
[11077.50s -> 11081.67s]  course it was got video where they're going to talk about bugs. Ants are math.
[11081.67s -> 11106.25s]  They're just a just a basic math problem. Whoa. This is cool. Look, it's the little spider.
[11106.25s -> 11110.89s]  Heard you've been helping out with the pollen quest. You got your 20 grains. Go on in.
[11110.89s -> 11124.52s]  Queen awaits. What does this get me? A new hat? Okay. 13.5 Andy.
[11126.68s -> 11131.58s]  All right. I heard so much about you. Have you brought the pollen for the princess royal jelly?
[11132.68s -> 11137.50s]  Yes, this shall make a powerful jelly. The new princess will be magnificent.
[11137.50s -> 11141.18s]  Wait here a moment while we prepare her. I'm sure she would love to meet you.
[11141.82s -> 11153.50s]  What do I actually get for doing this? Behold, your princess has arrived.
[11154.68s -> 11163.27s]  You're so beautiful. Such powerful wings. Thank you all for your hard labor preparing my royal jelly.
[11163.27s -> 11167.19s]  Dear spider, my mother told me of your predicament as I lay in my cell.
[11167.99s -> 11173.03s]  You're planning a rescue mission to a magic island in the sky. I can think of no greater
[11173.03s -> 11177.91s]  adventure with which to stretch my new wings. Come with me. I will take you home and help prepare
[11177.91s -> 11213.80s]  our voyage. Just eating my head. Nice hat. Thanks. We're going a long way. Okay. So what
[11214.36s -> 11231.59s]  what else do I need? Where the hell am I? Oh, here we are. All right. Did I get anything new?
[11232.23s -> 11237.75s]  Here's the rest of our free flight checklist. Talk to the princess about sealing up the balloon.
[11237.75s -> 11250.94s]  Okay. I need fuel. Okay. So I need fuel. Is the princess fixing this? Oh, there you are.
[11250.94s -> 11254.54s]  This is the balloon that's supposed to take us to the magic island in the sky.
[11255.10s -> 11266.86s]  It'll never make it in this condition. Let me fix that up for you. Prove this is your real hair.
[11269.32s -> 11281.00s]  See? This is real hair. But, uh, we shouldn't have any problems now. These wax patches are
[11281.00s -> 11289.32s]  completely airtight. All right. Cool. So now I need to have any fuel for the west.
[11289.96s -> 11298.66s]  So I need to go this way. Dung beetles, right? Cool. I saw the, I saw it. What do you mean?
[11298.66s -> 11309.19s]  I don't know what I was trying to do with that. Like I was trying to make it look like I had a
[11309.19s -> 11322.25s]  bald cap on or something. I don't know what that was. Weird. Okay. I want to go up this way.
[11322.25s -> 11328.74s]  Yeah. I was just moving my head back and forth. What the fuck was that? All right. This way.
[11330.78s -> 11368.44s]  This game's cute. This is a cute game. So go get fuel from the dung beetles. Huh? Did I miss my,
[11368.44s -> 11383.14s]  why am I back at this tutorial? Wrap around? Cause I need to go. Is there like a log to go
[11383.14s -> 11413.70s]  through or something? How do I get over there? Is there a log here? Um, how do I get over there?
[11413.70s -> 11467.40s]  I can't go over there. Maybe down into the left. There's a hole under the log. No help. You put
[11467.40s -> 11489.50s]  chicken fat in your hair. Down here? This is definitely it. Oh yeah. All right. Looking for
[11489.50s -> 11510.33s]  fuel for the hot air balloon. Oh shit. The speed run for this game is probably insane.
[11510.33s -> 11533.29s]  It probably is. Well, hold on. I, I can't breathe under there. Okay. So what am I looking for?
[11533.29s -> 11569.11s]  I can't grab onto any of this. So I got to move the rocks. Follow me. Here we go. I kind of,
[11569.11s -> 11579.08s]  I wonder how long, what's the speed run? Anybody know? What's the actual speed run? I can't get
[11579.08s -> 11624.12s]  up there. I can grab this. 16 minutes. Jesus. 16 minutes. That's so fast. I spent 16 minutes
[11624.12s -> 11646.33s]  stalling the start of my stream. Can't imagine completing this whole game in 16 minutes.
[11646.33s -> 11655.53s]  This level is cool because it's kind of just a lot of swinging. Swinging is fun. I feel like
[11655.53s -> 11660.58s]  there's such crazy tech with that too. With just the boom, boom, boom, boom. Make a thing to climb
[11660.58s -> 11682.63s]  on like that. And he's still moving. That's so cool. It takes my brain five seconds to go. I
[11682.63s -> 11714.26s]  can go there and there. There we go. There we go. Fluid. Fluid. Oh, be careful. I'm going in deep
[11714.26s -> 11730.98s]  here. How far up do I have to go? Oops. Oh, I have to launch this. I, yep. I think maybe eventually.
[11730.98s -> 11746.62s]  Okay. Let's try it. My eyes are so watery. Have I blinked in an hour? I think I'm in trouble here.
[11746.62s -> 11788.22s]  Wait, what's down here? Hmm. Can I pull this? I wonder what I'm supposed to do here. What do I do?
[11788.22s -> 11847.78s]  Oh, there we go. Kind of. Kind of. Yeah. Oh, get a launch. Launch. Launch. Swing. Up. Swing. Launch.
[11847.78s -> 11878.01s]  Launch. Swing. Launch. Ah! Swing and launch. There it is. Swing. Up. Launch. Okay. I'm getting
[11878.01s -> 11904.71s]  there. All right. Don't mess this up. Warning. Landslides. Bunker. Bunker. Oh my God. That scared
[11904.71s -> 11928.46s]  the shit out of me. Okay. What is that? Those are eggs. I don't know where I'm going. I'm just
[11928.46s -> 11938.87s]  sliding around. Mr. Sark is here. Oh, Mr. Sark is here. What's up, Sark? Hope you're doing well.
[11938.87s -> 11948.81s]  Mr. Sark is, I would say, one of the original funniest internet people in around a long time.
[11948.81s -> 11957.16s]  Maybe a lot of you don't know who Mr. Sark is. Oh, I would fix that immediately. Whoa. Hey there,
[11957.16s -> 11970.17s]  friend. Welcome to dung town. How do I get dung? Pushing a great big ball of dung is one of the
[11970.17s -> 11983.37s]  best workouts. Where do I get it? Fresh dung is the best dung. Where do I get it? What kind of dung
[11983.37s -> 11995.22s]  is it? Like cow shit? What do they use? You want some? You're in luck. We've got some friends with
[11995.22s -> 12001.06s]  loads of dung to share. It's not here. It's up the hill a fair way and there's one small problem
[12001.06s -> 12007.70s]  with getting up there. To the point. Look, we need to get across these puddles and I broke my wing
[12007.70s -> 12014.02s]  a while back. No flying means we're in need of a walking-based solution. I think you could use
[12014.02s -> 12018.60s]  your fancy web skills to string us a bridge out of them sticks. Help the beetles cross the puddles.
[12018.60s -> 12037.93s]  Okay. Done. Easy. Go. I got it. What do you guys want? I don't understand what they want.
[12044.78s -> 12065.27s]  They want a bridge? But how? I don't get it. I actually don't get it. They want me to make a
[12065.27s -> 12072.20s]  bridge but they can't walk a thing like this? Like just a basic little bridge? I don't understand.
[12076.09s -> 12085.40s]  Or do you mean pull these out of the water, make a bridge and then set these on top of the web?
[12112.97s -> 12118.98s]  No. You move out of the fucking way. You're just crowding me. Get out of the way. Stop the other.
[12118.98s -> 12127.53s]  What are you talking about? Wait, wait. I'm putting that, right? But then the log has to
[12127.53s -> 12135.11s]  go on top of those. On top of that. That's how this works. That's the only way it can work,
[12135.11s -> 12150.01s]  right? He's pretending. I can't make a bridge with two sticks. There's not enough. I need more
[12150.01s -> 12159.78s]  sticks. I need like 10 of these. How many? What? Look at that guy. How am I going to walk across
[12159.78s -> 12167.54s]  this? Look, these guys are so huge. The third log. How are they going to get across this one?
[12168.02s -> 12192.55s]  They're going to be stranded. Now what? He's almost. They said make us a nice bridge with your web.
[12192.55s -> 12199.27s]  All right, bros. Step on it. Go. Step on it then. What do you want me to do?
[12201.30s -> 12221.13s]  Hey, you fixed the bridge. Go. Yeah. Go ahead. You fucking idiots. That was not, that was,
[12221.85s -> 12225.96s]  that was fucked up. Yeah, please. That was fucked up.
[12228.04s -> 12234.54s]  That was fucked up. That was just like, he just mushed over all that.
[12234.54s -> 12249.46s]  I'm not soft-locked. Why are you being so toxic? I'm not being toxic. I'm being realistic. This
[12249.46s -> 12266.28s]  is, this is not toxic to say, dude, what are you? Go up. I need to move this big one over there now,
[12266.28s -> 12272.22s]  right? Because they're not going to go over there unless it's there. Is there one over the other
[12272.22s -> 12340.50s]  side? Stop yelling at them. Can I go under? I thought I was going to have to do that iPad game
[12340.50s -> 12344.55s]  where you make the whole bridge with the web. I thought I was going to have to do shit like this.
[12344.55s -> 12357.14s]  You know what I mean? Like connect the, make a bridge with the web and relax. You just relax.
[12357.14s -> 12367.00s]  Yes, bridge constructor. That's what I thought I was going to have to do. Okay. Go ahead and
[12367.00s -> 12380.25s]  cross it. What kind of bullshit is this? What? Just, just float. Just float. You know what, dude?
[12380.25s -> 12398.87s]  Just go. I promise you. Go. Why won't you go? Why won't he go? Give it a go. Yep. Go. You're,
[12398.95s -> 12417.80s]  he's there, right? Why won't, I don't, why wouldn't he go? All right, go ahead.
[12444.10s -> 12445.46s]  Tell him Wendy and Michael sent you.
[12448.50s -> 12450.58s]  Tell the Beatles and I got some dung.
[12452.66s -> 12460.49s]  Very nice. All right. So now I've got dung. I have fuel. Am I ready to go? What else is left?
[12460.49s -> 12469.50s]  You did that in the worst possible way. It's all right. It says to get done.
[12471.98s -> 12479.34s]  Ask yourself a question. Did the dung beetle get across the lake unharmed? That was the goal.
[12480.06s -> 12491.21s]  Yes. Does it matter how? Does it matter that the goal happened? Dung beetle gets across the
[12492.01s -> 12509.94s]  body of water completely unharmed. That's it. Was there like a dung beetle king or queen or
[12509.94s -> 12536.01s]  something? Cause I'm going all the way up. Look at this. What else is up here? It's kind of cool.
[12536.01s -> 12562.92s]  I don't care. What have I scaled the whole dung mountain? Is there a reliable fast way to get
[12562.92s -> 12601.62s]  back by the way? No secret. Come on. What is all the way over here? Oh Jesus. Hold on. Hey.
[12606.26s -> 12616.14s]  I don't actually, I'm not going to go to the whole thing, right? There's more to do
[12617.00s -> 12623.64s]  all the way up. Can you do a twerk stream? I don't think I would have to do a whole stream for that,
[12623.64s -> 12645.06s]  man. I think I just do that in five seconds. I think I have to weigh this down. No, don't.
[12645.06s -> 12674.06s]  Come here. I definitely have to put weight on this, right? What does this do? Okay. Oh,
[12674.06s -> 12695.70s]  all right. All the way, all the way. I wonder. Whoa. Hold on now. Don't go anywhere. What's the
[12695.70s -> 12718.60s]  point of that? I don't see anything here. What's the point of that? He probably could twerk if
[12718.60s -> 12723.80s]  he tried. It's going to take a hundred million dollars for me to twerk on stream. That's right.
[12723.80s -> 12787.86s]  There you go. Most of the peak you already did. What the fuck is this? How come I can't show this?
[12787.86s -> 12811.05s]  I can't like save that. Oh, here we go. Try this one. This isn't twerking though. It is twerking.
[12811.05s -> 12839.48s]  What? That was like a twerk. Yeah. Why does it sound like this is times? What speed is this?
[12839.48s -> 12859.24s]  It is slowed down. Hey, can you twerk? Yeah. That's fine. Whatever. I don't care. Being a handful of
[12860.60s -> 12863.72s]  beans. He admits it. He needs a glove. What the hell is he doing?
[12864.76s -> 12885.06s]  All right. I'm getting to the top of dung mountain. I know it's getting late. I feel like I'm pretty
[12885.06s -> 12891.64s]  close to the end of the game though. Yeah. Impromptu like 7 PM Pacific stream. And I do apologize for
[12891.64s -> 12897.34s]  that. Don't know why I'm not streaming tomorrow. And I decided to stream right now at 7 PM,
[12897.34s -> 12903.45s]  four hours ago or so, because I have to take Otto to the vet tomorrow. I'm going to get him checked
[12903.45s -> 12909.85s]  out. Just a couple of things. I want to make sure that he's good to go and I want to get him in.
[12909.85s -> 12917.30s]  So I'm going to be doing that tomorrow. We're doing house flipper pet DLC on Saturday and then Sunday
[12917.30s -> 12923.78s]  we're doing blood wash and the other horror game murder house. Or we might do that on Saturday and
[12923.78s -> 12930.76s]  then do pets on Sunday. Depends on how I feel. Keep us updated. Oh, I will. He's fine. Don't worry.
[12930.76s -> 12937.14s]  He's fine. I would tell you if I was actually concerned and I am not. So he's completely fine.
[12939.69s -> 12949.08s]  Yeah. Sorry. It's we started late and are going late. Still going here. I hope there's a fast
[12949.08s -> 12995.29s]  way to get back because I'm going across the whole damn game right now. God slow down. I just thought
[12995.29s -> 12998.57s]  of this picture again and it's like making me laugh. I just thought of this picture.
[12998.89s -> 13016.02s]  It's just flashed in my brain and I had to look at it again. I need to get to the top of Dung
[13016.02s -> 13040.66s]  Mountain even if it's a stupid just achievement or something. All right. Here we go. I made it.
[13040.66s -> 13049.94s]  Howdy, spider. Wendy and Mike sent you, did they? You must be here for the bounty of dung.
[13050.50s -> 13055.14s]  We got some for you right on over here. My problem is this dung is a little too comforting.
[13055.86s -> 13061.46s]  Our lazy son is simply refusing to leave the ball. It's so hot out there. Why would I want to leave?
[13062.42s -> 13066.18s]  Spider, it's all yours if you can convince him to get out and see a bit of the world.
[13067.06s -> 13098.12s]  Give it a little push. Oh, hang on. Hang on. Hang on. So this is the fast way to get back.
[13098.76s -> 13115.96s]  That makes sense. Hang on. They make it. Nice. I got the fuel. You're going to kill him. He's
[13115.96s -> 13129.03s]  fine. It's padding. Did I seriously just get kicked out of my home? I'll just have to live
[13129.11s -> 13137.53s]  here now, I guess. Help yourself to some dung. It's my favorite. Very energy dense. Okay. How
[13137.53s -> 13154.23s]  much do I need? How many balls of dung do I need? Can you come grab this? Oh, it's coming all the
[13154.23s -> 13160.89s]  way down. All right. How many balls should I do? One or two? I'll try. I'll try to grab one. No.
[13161.53s -> 13203.78s]  All right. Send it up. No. Okay. Now you just fuck with me. Get up there. Dung. Here we go.
[13203.78s -> 13243.74s]  Where do I need to put it? Okay. Am I ready to go? Okay. Now the dung is to go in underneath
[13243.74s -> 13271.37s]  there, right? Grab the dung. Dung in the cup. That's what I'm trying to do. Okay. Here's the
[13271.37s -> 13277.30s]  rest of the checklist. Attach engine immediately below the mouth of the balloon. Burn the secret
[13277.30s -> 13289.11s]  pilot platform to balloon. Just follow the blueprints. Fuel in the engine. Engine up into
[13289.11s -> 13294.95s]  here. It's patched up. Spider web this all. I'm ready to go. Okay. Now we stick this in here.
[13295.67s -> 13356.81s]  That's good. So now I have to attach this. Let's click in there already. Click in there. Why is
[13356.81s -> 13378.41s]  it not clicking in there? Come on. Do like a... It doesn't click in. Oh, well it's in. All right.
[13378.41s -> 13412.97s]  It's in. Now I need webs. I'm ready to fly. Are you ready to head out? Okay. So I got that done. I
[13412.97s -> 13436.98s]  need to go turn in the bugs. Why did it fall? This doesn't look safe. Retach it. Turn up the music
[13436.98s -> 13462.04s]  for the finale. Okay. We did it. Engine normal. Airspeed increasing. This is it. We're flying.
[13462.04s -> 13490.81s]  Engine nominal. Airspeed increasing. This is it. We're flying. What if I cut the strings? You can't.
[13490.81s -> 13506.06s]  Oh, dude. Fuck it. Let's get the skateboard out. No, not the board, bro. The ship is holding on
[13506.06s -> 13572.52s]  barely. I got it. We're fine. Mayday? What the fuck is that? I don't know. These are like asteroids.
[13572.52s -> 13580.18s]  It's gems. How do I collect the gems? Well, this storm was not on the forecast. The ship is still
[13580.18s -> 13593.19s]  holding out. The wind is really picking up now. I feel so alive. Uh-oh. Stay safe. We'll keep the
[13593.19s -> 13616.33s]  engine running for you. It was all fucked up. I had to fix it. This is it. The Sky Bower. The
[13616.33s -> 13620.17s]  airship won't be able to make it any further in the storm. You'll have to continue without us.
[13620.17s -> 13632.42s]  Go find your love. We'll meet you on the other side. This is the crow place. He says uh-oh,
[13632.42s -> 13657.03s]  like a toddler who shit his pants. Uh-oh. Oh, no. Up in the sky area. This is kind of loud.
[13657.59s -> 13713.93s]  Do I have to take this with me or something? Where do I go? Is that break? Um, what? Oh, okay.
[13713.93s -> 13723.19s]  All right. I get it. Yeah, this is gonna be a pain in the ass, isn't it? A little, a little loud
[13723.19s -> 13761.50s]  for me. Nothing down there. All right. Let's just go here. I'm here. Where is it? Up there. Shit.
[13761.50s -> 13845.67s]  Get over here. We're good. Oh, shit. Oh, will you please? Come on. Oh, my God. Boy. Okay. All
[13845.67s -> 13857.00s]  right. I made it. I got it. I got it. I need the ball. Where's the ball? Where's the ball?
[13857.96s -> 13884.52s]  Where's the ball? I left the ball. Are you kidding me? Where? I didn't leave the ball.
[13885.08s -> 13965.99s]  Where's the ball? Am I soft-locked? Huh? Holy shit. That was 100 IQ. Yes. Okay. Let me take a look.
[13965.99s -> 14000.26s]  What's over here? A lot of bullshit. Where are you going? Go in. Go in. Go in. I'm almost there.
[14000.26s -> 14033.40s]  There's gonna be two, isn't there? Oh, God. Where is it? Okay. There's one here. All right.
[14033.40s -> 14056.76s]  Just go underneath. I don't need to. Should be fine. Come with me. There it is. Thank you.
[14068.38s -> 14083.98s]  And open the door. Not bad. I made it. Do I have to fight the crow? I don't want to really fight.
[14083.98s -> 14135.98s]  I like crows. And oh, shit. Escape the skybower with your boyfriend. I found you. Can we get out
[14135.98s -> 14149.37s]  of here? All right. Come with me. We got to go. We got to go now. Come on. We got to go now.
[14150.84s -> 14187.38s]  We got to go now. We got to go now. Oh, okay. You got any of those gems anywhere? I need a gem.
[14187.38s -> 14215.54s]  Is your head made out of gems? What? Oh, I think I saw the crow. Can you get up here?
[14215.54s -> 14225.00s]  Nope. I got you. I got you. Watch out. Okay. You're good.
[14232.98s -> 14263.26s]  You make it. Come on. Holding Q is kind of hard in doing W-A-S-T. What's wrong? Get over here, you
[14263.82s -> 14286.22s]  dummy. What the? You settle the fuck down. Like, honestly, God, settle the fuck down. Really?
[14286.22s -> 14294.06s]  That was so outrageous. That was so over the top. That was fucking horrible for me. I don't know
[14294.06s -> 14301.21s]  why. Why is that so bad? That wasn't even a tuber reaction. That was like, I just, I really did not
[14301.21s -> 14310.90s]  think that was going to happen for any reason. That was so bad. Why did I get scared so bad?
[14310.90s -> 14331.99s]  It was the music too. Yo, you scared my bird. Oh, let's hear what they have to say. Oh, wow.
[14331.99s -> 14349.93s]  A lot to say that bird. Wow. One of my mods is saying when you screamed, that made my discord
[14349.93s -> 14361.58s]  lag for some reason. Will you get up here? We could have already been through the stupid
[14361.58s -> 14402.55s]  jump scare part. Follow me. Just get bird boy technique. You know what? I'm done. I don't think
[14402.55s -> 14426.90s]  this does anything. Whoa. Shit. Wait. Can you go through spider silk? Yeah. Right down here.
[14426.90s -> 14482.58s]  Get down here, quick. Rush his face. Aha. Good. Hurry before he sees us. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry,
[14482.58s -> 14520.12s]  hurry. Before he sees us. Oh my God. Damn it. That was, this thing's scary. Where'd he go?
[14520.12s -> 14523.72s]  Oh my God. Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back. I thought that was, I didn't
[14523.72s -> 14535.02s]  think it was a wall. Oh, good thing I, I, I got his mouth. I got his mouth sucked, sucked, sewed,
[14535.02s -> 14575.86s]  got whatever. No, come on. I don't know what I need to attach it to. We go now. You fucking
[14575.86s -> 14616.89s]  kidding me? I can't. Get over here. Out of sight, out of sight, out of sight, out of sight. I don't
[14616.89s -> 14669.51s]  know where he is. Yeah. I knew he's going to be like right here. God. Bro, let's press the button,
[14669.51s -> 14724.17s]  man. What the hell are you doing? Can you hold this? What do I do? I'm afraid to go up here.
[14724.17s -> 14779.22s]  See? That's terrifying. Oh, that was right there. Shit. Just clear everything. Clear the whole
[14779.22s -> 14794.25s]  fucking thing. Essentially what I wanted. All right, now pull that down. Don't kill me. What?
[14795.05s -> 14842.02s]  Why did it not land on the web? Click. Hurry up. Wait, don't go fast. He's going to be right here,
[14842.02s -> 14868.62s]  isn't he? Hey, back up. Good. Little Spider, you made it and you've rescued your boyfriend.
[14869.42s -> 14874.89s]  We're almost ready to go home. Vlad is just bringing the airship around now. Wait, he's
[14874.97s -> 14892.28s]  coming. Watch out. What? Hold on, Little Spider. We're going to catch this bird.
[14893.56s -> 14943.62s]  Defeat the bird. Help, help, help, help. Whoa. Whoa. He's fucking dead. Sorry we're late. Just
[14943.62s -> 14950.66s]  picked up a little help on the way. Hey, neighbor. MechAnt1 reporting for duty. This beast doesn't
[14950.66s -> 14957.29s]  stand a chance. Coming in close now. I'm already dead. I hit the ground already. Let's do this.
[14957.93s -> 14972.89s]  What do you want me to do? I didn't read that. I didn't read that. What did I have to do? I
[14972.89s -> 15025.78s]  didn't read it. I'm in position. Get clear. Attaching MechAnt1. We're going to fight his
[15025.78s -> 15047.29s]  head off. Okay, we did it. Now we can let go. We did it. The beast is grounded. What should we do
[15047.29s -> 15054.89s]  with him now, comrade? We send him away. You hear me, bird? You burnt all your bridges here.
[15055.85s -> 15059.53s]  The bugs of this bush will not put up with you eating and kidnapping their friends.
[15060.90s -> 15065.38s]  Now we have the means to defend ourselves. We need to find a new land to call home.
[15066.02s -> 15071.56s]  Maybe somewhere far away from here with more birds like you. Maybe somewhere you can finally
[15071.56s -> 15089.46s]  find a friend. But you leave now or I change my mind. Oh my, that was scary. I wasn't sure I'd
[15089.46s -> 15095.06s]  be able to talk to him, but I did it. Thank you, buddy. Thank you too, buddy's boyfriend.
[15095.06s -> 15100.10s]  Your brave actions gave me the courage to finally send up to that menace. Home is a little bit safer
[15100.10s -> 15117.88s]  today thanks to you. I did it. That was fun. Nice job. That was fun. All right, but wait,
[15117.88s -> 15144.94s]  this is the post-season credits. He doesn't know. I wish this game had music. I turned it down, man.
[15145.58s -> 15165.06s]  We should watch the speed run. What's the, uh, one of the mods link, uh, the world record? I'm
[15165.06s -> 15173.61s]  curious. I'm the second place runner as of a few days ago. Rip. Oh, wow. That's still pretty,
[15173.61s -> 15185.08s]  that's still awesome though. I mean, that's still, it's ridiculous. World record 1631. Is it any
[15185.08s -> 15192.60s]  percent or do you, uh, just any percent? Well, hold on. This is cute. And you as buddy the spider.
[15192.60s -> 15215.58s]  How come that bird's so nice? Why was the crow so mean? Why was the marshmallow one so nice? Oh,
[15215.58s -> 15237.96s]  hold on. Baby? Baby? Is that a baby spider? What is it? A baby? Oh, it's babies. A lot of babies.
[15241.86s -> 15271.78s]  Where do we go now? Very cool. What's through here? Is it just free roam now? It's probably
[15271.78s -> 15302.30s]  just free roam. Oh, hold on. So do you get a, what do I get for this? Give me a hat.
[15304.71s -> 15313.46s]  Yeah. Let me put the speed run on. I'm very curious about this. It's just, I have to watch
[15313.46s -> 15343.18s]  the whole thing. We do not have to watch the whole thing. It's only 16 minutes. Hold on. Let's get
[15343.18s -> 15384.26s]  it. Let's get a good view. So you, you use propulsion. What the fuck? What? You just throw
[15384.26s -> 15403.94s]  yourself down and you use the laser for propulsion. I can't even tell what's happening. Wow. This is
[15403.94s -> 15409.10s]  really a pretty, I would say this is probably a pretty good speed running game, right? There's
[15409.10s -> 15417.00s]  not a whole lot of, it's a lot of just go get that thing and put it over here. Do you even
[15417.00s -> 15422.55s]  have to help anybody? Actually, to get the, I think you have to. To get the, to get the
[15423.35s -> 15430.06s]  heart rate balloon, right? The whole lot. Does, does the movement speed stack? Does it have a
[15430.06s -> 15443.45s]  cap? Or can you just actually fly and throw yourself around? Oh, look at that. About getting a good
[15443.45s -> 15449.94s]  angle in the central mechanic. Yeah. This is definitely a speed running game. What the hell
[15449.94s -> 15472.84s]  was that? What? This is an actual spider. Yeah. This really is an actual spider. I'm curious about
[15472.84s -> 15491.85s]  the, that. Wow. That was close. That's so cool. All right. What about, I want to see up here.
[15491.85s -> 15514.63s]  Put on break core. I want to see one of these down. I want to see what happens at the end here.
[15514.63s -> 15537.53s]  So you just, you just, you just drag. Dude, what? How are you even supposed to do that?
[15537.53s -> 15557.61s]  All right. That was pretty cool. All right. Here comes the fight with the bird. How do you do this
[15557.61s -> 15589.00s]  fast? Oh, you guys can't even hear it. What? Wait, what, what just happened? Don't you have to web
[15589.00s -> 15606.82s]  the bird? It's a skip. Wow. Well, there it is. Well, congratulations. This is your world record.
[15606.82s -> 15619.91s]  That's really cool. That's so cool. This game's got some bugs in it. Time that person up for an
[15619.91s -> 15635.83s]  hour. Yeah. Link to the speed run. Yeah. We'll link the speed run. Here is a link to the world record.
[15635.83s -> 15644.81s]  If you'd like to take a look. The video that was just on screen. That's really cool. All right. I
[15644.81s -> 15657.11s]  think that's it. We get a baseball update. July 14th. July 14th. Mark it on your calendar.
[15657.11s -> 15665.77s]  Baseball is going to be July 14th. Yeah. I don't want to go too, too late. Impromptu stream here.
[15665.77s -> 15670.09s]  Supposed to be streaming tomorrow, but schedule getting changed. I got to take care of Otto.
[15670.09s -> 15677.58s]  So we'll see you later. We'll see you again. I will see you guys on Saturday. We'll do Saturday,
[15677.58s -> 15683.72s]  Sunday. And we're going to, we'll go a little longer. The last two days in a row have been
[15683.72s -> 15691.64s]  four hour, four and a half hour here. I'd like to stream for at least five to seven hours. So we
[15691.64s -> 15706.38s]  will do some long ones this weekend. Four hour Andy. That was a cute game. I like that a lot.
[15706.38s -> 15712.70s]  That was requested for a while too. That's fun. Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry to every sci-fi fantasy
[15713.74s -> 15718.25s]  fan of any show ever. I feel like you lost a little bit of respect for me tonight.
[15718.25s -> 15732.50s]  Very sorry. I want to profusely apologize. Very sorry about that. We have a lot of fun here,
[15732.50s -> 15741.67s]  don't we? Show the image again. This is the one that I still have. It queued up. I really thought
[15741.67s -> 15746.58s]  that you mashed these two together. I don't know. I haven't seen like really much of either.
[15747.38s -> 15758.30s]  I mean, I've seen Rick and Morty. All right. I'll see you guys later. Thanks for watching.
[15758.30s -> 15764.84s]  See you soon. See you Saturday. I will give you an auto update. He's going to be fine.
[15764.84s -> 15768.55s]  I just want to check him out for a couple of things. Things that are
[15769.27s -> 15772.79s]  at least concerning enough for me to want him to go to the vet. So, but he's fine.
[15772.79s -> 15799.27s]  I'll give you an update. Good luck, Otto. Yeah. Good luck, Otto. Otto. Thanks for the subs.
[15799.27s -> 15806.01s]  Thanks for the bits. A lot of subs were coming in today. A lot of community subs.
[15806.01s -> 15818.98s]  That was a good, yeah, it was just fun. I really like these experiences. Games that are between
[15818.98s -> 15829.64s]  three and five hours. They're almost perfect. I love these little bite size experiences.
[15829.64s -> 15860.38s]  Hope you had fun. I did. Small experiences for a small man. I'm very, I'm actually kind of nervous
[15860.38s -> 15863.42s]  for Dextreme because it's going to be a brand new audio setup, but I'm going to sound completely
[15863.42s -> 15871.43s]  different. You guys are going to have to give me some feedback. I need to know how it sounds,
[15871.43s -> 15882.36s]  good or bad. What's the schedule? Saturday at 4 p.m. Pacific is the next live stream on this
[15882.36s -> 15915.30s]  channel. Get some sleep. Take care of yourselves. Call your mother, you know, as usual. He said
[15915.30s -> 15930.15s]  that like four streams in a row now. Yeah, Saturday at 4 p.m. Pacific. Good night. Take care of
[15930.15s -> 15932.38s]  yourselves and goodbye.
